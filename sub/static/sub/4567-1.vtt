- Hey, Sam.
- Yeah.

00:48.281 --> 00:50.388
- Have a good day. Love you.
- You too.

00:56.824 --> 00:59.394
<i>It is the morning shift here
at WKEZ Chicago.</i>

01:54.931 --> 01:56.218
Go on in. You're gonna be late.

01:59.820 --> 02:02.125
Morning, Fernando.

02:44.764 --> 02:46.770
Good morning.

02:48.135 --> 02:49.905
Hey. Hi.

03:03.284 --> 03:05.019
Pass up your papers.

03:05.119 --> 03:07.721
Want to talk about this worksheet

03:07.821 --> 03:09.991
before you leave for the pep rally.

03:10.391 --> 03:13.060
Ms. Abbott, we want to talk
about the school closing.

03:13.160 --> 03:16.066
Yeah, what you gonna do, Ms. Abbott?
You gonna transfer to Mitchell?

03:16.166 --> 03:17.835
I don't know. With the school closing,

03:17.935 --> 03:20.609
all of us teachers have
to look for new positions,

03:20.709 --> 03:24.872
but I'm sure you guys will give me
good recommendations, right?

03:24.972 --> 03:27.107
I want to talk about prom.

03:27.207 --> 03:30.611
I want to talk about graduation, 'cause
I'm ready to get the hell up out of here.

03:30.711 --> 03:33.815
Okay, good. Great.
Yes, we all want to graduate. Right?

03:33.915 --> 03:36.445
So this semester, I really want you guys
to focus on what you're gonna do

03:36.545 --> 03:39.987
- after you graduate, okay?
- I'ma play ball.

03:40.087 --> 03:42.756
Jamal, you don't even play ball now.

03:43.269 --> 03:44.658
I'ma go to college, though.

03:44.758 --> 03:47.229
I'ma get my degree,
and I'ma travel all around the world,

03:47.329 --> 03:50.264
and if I like you,
I'ma send you a postcard.

03:50.964 --> 03:53.067
Yes, Jasmine is right, you guys.

03:53.167 --> 03:56.972
We should all be wanting to go to college.
Every single one of us, okay?

04:17.523 --> 04:20.127
- Hi, do you sell pregnancy tests?
- What?

04:20.226 --> 04:21.428
Pregnancy tests?

04:25.667 --> 04:28.789
You girls are supposed to be
at the pep rally, okay? Let's go.

04:30.371 --> 04:32.073
Come on.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.088
Fuck.

06:13.306 --> 06:16.644
- Hello.
- Hey, you're home late.

06:16.744 --> 06:21.482
Yeah, I had Cliff's thing, remember?
Retirement party?

06:21.582 --> 06:25.320
Anyway, went to Hopleaf.
I got you some beers.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.790
I'm putting them in the fridge.

06:38.931 --> 06:41.602
- What you working on?
- Oh, my God.

06:41.702 --> 06:44.906
I did... Hey.

06:49.275 --> 06:51.312
I think I'm pregnant.

07:01.154 --> 07:03.186
Are you okay?

07:04.492 --> 07:06.184
I don't...

07:07.348 --> 07:11.030
I don't... I don't know
what to do, you know? I...

07:12.130 --> 07:15.839
I mean, we've never really, like,
talked about this before, you know?

07:16.470 --> 07:18.676
No, yeah, I don't know.

07:18.906 --> 07:21.142
But I don't know, you know.
I might not be.

07:21.242 --> 07:23.304
I was looking some stuff up online,

07:23.404 --> 07:25.779
and I guess if you have
too much potassium,

07:25.879 --> 07:29.166
this guy on a message board said
that it can give you a false positive,

07:29.266 --> 07:33.206
and I had... I had a banana
with my yogurt this morning, and...

07:33.306 --> 07:35.718
I don't... I don't know.
It was really big,

07:35.818 --> 07:39.893
and I just... I don't know what is going on
with the bananas at Trader Joe's right now.

07:39.993 --> 07:43.764
- They're just so big, and I think that...
- Hang on, hang on. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

07:43.864 --> 07:47.651
Just... so you took a test?

07:48.535 --> 07:49.974
Yes.

07:51.872 --> 07:53.435
And you are pregnant.

07:54.408 --> 07:58.279
Oh, God, I just thought
we would deal with this later

07:58.379 --> 08:01.036
if we got married or...

08:01.882 --> 08:03.651
fuck.

08:03.751 --> 08:07.021
Oh, my God. I'm gonna lose my job, John.

08:07.121 --> 08:10.557
I'm gonna lose my stupid job,
and now I'm pregnant.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.726
Hey. Hey.

08:14.111 --> 08:16.581
Come on. Come here.

08:21.734 --> 08:24.672
This is not how I thought
it would happen.

08:29.542 --> 08:31.278
Fuck.

08:32.645 --> 08:34.482
Yeah.

08:34.881 --> 08:35.784
Fuck.

08:56.161 --> 08:58.906
- Hey. Want some coffee?
- Good morning.

08:59.006 --> 09:00.775
Yeah.

09:33.138 --> 09:35.093
- John.
- Listen...

09:35.193 --> 09:38.178
I know this probably isn't
how you imagined it happening.

09:38.278 --> 09:42.850
John, I don't want you to propose to me
just because I'm pregnant.

09:42.950 --> 09:46.455
And I don't want you to say yes
just 'cause I gave you pancakes.

09:47.287 --> 09:50.694
I want to be your husband. You know?

09:50.794 --> 09:53.530
I want to have this baby with you.

09:53.630 --> 09:56.600
This is what we want, right?
This is what you want?

09:59.869 --> 10:01.606
Yeah.

10:02.606 --> 10:04.308
Yeah.

10:07.376 --> 10:09.570
Sam...

10:09.670 --> 10:11.907
will you marry me?

10:14.016 --> 10:15.767
- Yes.
- Yeah?

10:15.867 --> 10:17.655
Yeah.

10:17.955 --> 10:19.557
Here.

10:21.457 --> 10:23.271
It's pretty good.

10:25.127 --> 10:26.964
It's beautiful.

10:32.368 --> 10:35.206
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

10:37.007 --> 10:39.285
Oh, gosh, what are we gonna do?

10:40.377 --> 10:42.513
What are we gonna do
when this baby comes, John?

10:42.613 --> 10:45.215
The school's closing, right?
Take a couple years off.

10:45.315 --> 10:47.918
Enjoy being a mom. I'll float us.

10:48.018 --> 10:50.554
This is gonna be so cool.

10:50.654 --> 10:54.475
Hey. We're gonna be a family.

10:54.575 --> 10:56.026
Right?

10:56.126 --> 10:59.530
- Oh, God, I love you.
- I love you.

11:03.905 --> 11:08.071
Do you, Samantha Abbott, take John Bruzek
to be your lawfully wedded husband?

11:08.171 --> 11:09.172
I do.

11:09.272 --> 11:12.993
And do you, John Bruzek, take Samantha
Abbott to be your lawfully wedded wife?

11:13.093 --> 11:14.058
I do.

11:14.158 --> 11:16.614
Then by the power vested in me
by the state of Illinois,

11:16.714 --> 11:19.810
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

11:20.684 --> 11:22.185
Congratulations.

11:22.285 --> 11:26.056
- That was so easy.
- Why do people make it so complicated?

11:26.156 --> 11:30.360
- Now you're just my husband.
- I know, and you're my wife.

11:30.460 --> 11:32.495
Did you notice the judge's name
was Judith?

11:32.595 --> 11:35.532
- No way.
- We just got married by Judge Judy.

11:35.632 --> 11:38.502
- That's great.
- We got to tell our parents.

11:38.602 --> 11:39.870
Do we have to?

11:39.970 --> 11:42.940
I am so excited you guys
wanted to come over for dinner.

11:43.040 --> 11:47.778
- That looks great, Carolyn.
- Thank you, John. Give me your plates.

11:47.878 --> 11:53.117
Actually, Mom, we had something
that we wanted to tell you.

11:54.784 --> 11:57.354
Well, John and I...

11:57.454 --> 11:59.043
Got engaged.

11:59.890 --> 12:05.062
I knew it. I am so happy for you two.

12:07.798 --> 12:09.366
Baby.

12:09.466 --> 12:12.035
This is absolutely fabulous.

12:12.135 --> 12:14.605
We have so much to do,
so tell me everything.

12:14.705 --> 12:18.075
Actually, Mom, we...
we already got married.

12:18.375 --> 12:21.058
- What did you say?
- We already got married.

12:21.158 --> 12:25.282
Why would you do that?
Oh, my God, you're pregnant.

12:25.382 --> 12:29.786
- How did this happen?
- Well, it was a surprise.

12:30.786 --> 12:33.890
What will you do now?
How will you get a job next year?

12:33.990 --> 12:36.162
We talked about it,

12:36.460 --> 12:40.163
and I'm thinking of...
I'm staying home for a little while.

12:40.263 --> 12:42.966
Honey, you don't want to stay at home.

12:43.066 --> 12:46.770
Well, with the cost of child care
and my salary,

12:46.870 --> 12:50.187
- I'd hardly be bringing anything home.
- But you have a master's degree.

12:50.287 --> 12:52.153
When your cousin Valerie
quit her job after Max was born,

12:52.253 --> 12:55.495
- you said it was a waste of talent.
- What? I didn't say that.

12:55.595 --> 12:59.502
- You did say that.
- Okay, fine, Mom. I've changed my mind.

12:59.602 --> 13:04.102
And besides, no school is gonna
hire me when I'm due in August.

13:05.355 --> 13:06.957
Well...

13:09.559 --> 13:12.130
I guess you two have it all figured out.

13:14.930 --> 13:17.568
I just don't know how two people
are gonna take care of a baby.

13:17.668 --> 13:22.831
- You don't even own a washer/dryer.
- Hey, we don't need a washer/dryer, okay?

13:25.941 --> 13:30.147
You know, Mom, we didn't
do this to hurt your feelings.

13:30.247 --> 13:34.851
- These are supposed to be happy things.
- But they're not happening in a happy way.

13:34.951 --> 13:38.689
This is not want I wanted. I wanted to see you
walk down the aisle in a wedding dress,

13:38.789 --> 13:41.592
and I wanted a big cake,
and I wanted flowers and all of it.

13:41.692 --> 13:45.195
Then you get pregnant, Sam,
after the wedding.

13:45.295 --> 13:47.530
Samantha, I just...

13:48.298 --> 13:49.968
what do you want me to tell people?

13:53.068 --> 13:55.439
Well, that wasn't so bad.

13:55.539 --> 14:00.477
Are you kidding me? That was the worst.

14:00.577 --> 14:03.413
I mean, she hates me,
and she hates our baby.

14:03.513 --> 14:05.849
Okay, she doesn't hate you,

14:05.949 --> 14:10.853
and she's gonna love our baby
probably more than we can handle.

14:10.953 --> 14:14.169
I just wish you would have helped me out
a little bit more in there, John.

14:14.269 --> 14:17.338
What? I said the thing
about the washer/dryer.

14:17.894 --> 14:19.563
John.

14:20.163 --> 14:21.785
What?

14:23.033 --> 14:26.833
Maybe she's right. We rushed it.

14:27.370 --> 14:31.007
- Did we rush it?
- Well, we kind of had to.

14:44.187 --> 14:47.120
'Cause we all posing and stuff.

14:48.558 --> 14:50.761
You about to get your ass beat, Jamal!

14:50.861 --> 14:54.397
- She mad now.
- Hey. Guys, settle down, okay?

14:55.732 --> 14:57.401
Guys.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.937
Hey, I want everyone back
in their seats right now.

15:01.037 --> 15:03.039
Somebody need to get
this bitch out my face

15:03.139 --> 15:04.875
'cause I'm about to pop
the fuck off right now.

15:04.975 --> 15:06.900
- Try it. Try it.
- Hey, hey. Come on. Come on.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.345
I need you to sit down.

15:08.445 --> 15:10.147
- LaParis, give me the phone.
- He hit me in the face.

15:10.247 --> 15:13.968
I don't care. You're being loud
and disrespectful. Now give me that phone.

15:14.068 --> 15:15.752
God, I'm not up for this today.

15:15.852 --> 15:19.556
- Ms. Abbott got a rock on her finger, damn.
- That's nice.

15:19.656 --> 15:22.459
- You gonna get married, Ms. Abbott?
- She gonna marry Coach Harwell.

15:22.559 --> 15:24.561
Coach Harwell is 30 years older than me.

15:24.661 --> 15:27.501
She ain't with no Coach Harwell.
She got a boyfriend.

15:27.601 --> 15:30.767
- We're not talking about this right now.
- You gonna change your name?

15:30.867 --> 15:33.617
Okay, listen, guys. I got married...

15:33.917 --> 15:35.922
which is normal.

15:36.022 --> 15:38.275
You can still call me Ms. Abbott.

15:38.375 --> 15:40.477
That's all we're gonna talk about to...

15:56.490 --> 15:58.435
How you feeling?

15:59.195 --> 16:00.997
Humiliated.

16:01.097 --> 16:03.433
You think the whole school
knows I'm pregnant?

16:03.533 --> 16:07.905
You puked in front of 30 teenagers.
I think everybody knows.

16:09.873 --> 16:11.742
- Hey, Jasmine.
- Hey.

16:11.842 --> 16:14.544
I just wanted to see if Ms. Abbott
was feeling better.

16:14.644 --> 16:17.430
Yeah. I'm okay.

16:17.530 --> 16:20.216
- Thanks.
- Okay. Y'all have a great weekend.

16:20.316 --> 16:24.805
Hey, wait. Jasmine, when are you
gonna give me your list of colleges?

16:24.905 --> 16:26.189
I haven't narrowed it down yet.

16:26.289 --> 16:29.292
Okay, well, do you think you could
give it to me in homeroom next week?

16:29.392 --> 16:30.274
Yeah.

16:30.374 --> 16:33.008
Look, if you need any help,
you know where to find me, okay?

16:33.108 --> 16:35.193
Yeah, leaning over a trash can.

16:35.665 --> 16:38.669
- Bye, Ms. Abbott.
- Bye, Jasmine.

17:19.810 --> 17:25.315
<i>With pollen crushed into its stigma,
the hammer orchid is fertilized.</i>

17:25.415 --> 17:30.620
<i>The little dummy female withers,
its purpose served.</i>

17:41.785 --> 17:44.668
- How do you know?
- Trust me. You can tell.

17:44.768 --> 17:48.338
- She's not showing.
- I'm telling you. She's pregnant.

17:48.997 --> 17:52.543
- Are you guys talking about me?
- No, we know about you.

17:52.893 --> 17:56.613
- Garrett thinks Jasmine Davis is pregnant.
- Jasmine Davis? No.

17:56.713 --> 17:58.123
Oh, she's pregnant.

17:58.223 --> 18:01.418
I just don't understand how these girls
get themselves into these situations.

18:01.518 --> 18:02.953
It's like they want to get pregnant.

18:03.053 --> 18:05.522
All you got to do is go to the school
clinic, get yourself some condoms.

18:05.622 --> 18:08.558
And it's only gonna get worse
when CPS closes all these schools.

18:08.658 --> 18:11.127
A huge chunk of 'em
are just gonna drop out.

18:11.227 --> 18:14.378
I'm telling you. She came up to me
in the lunchroom...

18:14.478 --> 18:17.667
in my line, came up to me acting
like I want her dirty-ass dude,

18:17.767 --> 18:20.937
and I'm like, "Bitch, I'm not trying
to talk to his dopey ass."

18:21.037 --> 18:21.993
Let her know.

18:22.093 --> 18:24.307
She think I'm trying to talk to him
because we lab partners.

18:24.407 --> 18:27.210
You know I ain't pick his ass.
His breath stinks so bad.

18:27.310 --> 18:31.247
- I'm trying to get away from him.
- He do have stink breath.

18:31.347 --> 18:33.483
Ms. Abbott,
can you play checkers with us?

18:33.583 --> 18:37.756
No, thank you. I'm just gonna borrow Jasmine
here for a second. Want to come with me?

18:40.056 --> 18:41.650
Chynice,

18:41.750 --> 18:43.821
rotate in.

18:56.772 --> 18:58.608
Are you pregnant?

19:00.642 --> 19:02.645
You're pregnant.

19:02.745 --> 19:06.082
- How did this happen?
- You the science teacher.

19:06.182 --> 19:07.717
Come on, Jasmine.

19:07.817 --> 19:09.753
Ms. Abbott, you know me
since freshman year.

19:09.903 --> 19:12.453
You know this isn't something
I planned on.

19:13.356 --> 19:15.559
How pregnant are you?

19:16.059 --> 19:18.028
Ten weeks.

19:18.128 --> 19:21.231
And who's the father? Another senior?

19:21.331 --> 19:24.770
Nah, this boy I been
talking to for a while.

19:24.870 --> 19:26.786
He don't go here.

19:26.886 --> 19:28.038
Don't worry.

19:28.138 --> 19:31.908
- I'm not gonna drop out or nothing.
- Well, no shit you're not gonna drop out.

19:32.008 --> 19:35.045
I know, but you was just all hard up
on me going to college and stuff.

19:35.145 --> 19:39.800
Well, Jasmine, you have to at least apply.
You've got a 3.8 GPA.

19:39.900 --> 19:41.802
I know.

19:45.020 --> 19:48.425
So do you think
that you want to keep it?

19:51.827 --> 19:53.797
I don't know.

19:59.468 --> 20:01.074
All right.

20:05.808 --> 20:07.863
- Yes?
- Hi.

20:07.963 --> 20:12.182
I just found out that
one of my students is pregnant.

20:12.282 --> 20:16.519
- I don't know what the protocol is or...
- Is she in a dangerous situation?

20:17.219 --> 20:20.056
I don't... I don't know.
She's one of my best students.

20:20.156 --> 20:22.425
I haven't noticed anything
out of the ordinary.

20:22.525 --> 20:25.578
Well, unfortunately, that kind
of thing happens a lot here.

20:25.678 --> 20:26.993
We have some pamphlets.

20:27.093 --> 20:29.962
There are resources.
We have a daycare here at the school.

20:30.062 --> 20:34.037
She'll have to go on homebound when she
gets closer to delivery. What's her name?

20:34.137 --> 20:36.457
Jasmine Davis.

20:37.907 --> 20:40.995
- I'll put a note in her file.
- Okay. Thanks.

21:13.142 --> 21:14.755
Hey.

21:15.978 --> 21:19.176
- Where's Grandma?
- At work.

21:19.949 --> 21:23.153
You gonna spoil your dinner
if you eat all them Cheetos.

22:39.928 --> 22:42.035
I decided to keep it.

22:43.465 --> 22:45.456
Are you sure?

22:46.186 --> 22:50.673
- Yeah. I'm sure.
- And you know all of your options?

22:50.773 --> 22:54.813
You mean, like, give it up
or have an abortion?

22:56.812 --> 22:58.114
Yeah.

22:59.114 --> 23:00.961
I'm gonna keep it.

23:03.185 --> 23:04.687
All right.

23:04.787 --> 23:08.225
- What are you gonna do?
- About what?

23:09.025 --> 23:12.391
Oh, I'm... I'm gonna keep it.

23:13.513 --> 23:14.551
Cool.

23:14.651 --> 23:18.701
There's some scholarships on here I think
you could get. Your grades are really good.

23:18.801 --> 23:22.839
- What schools were on your list?
- I was really excited about Illinois.

23:22.939 --> 23:26.710
Illinois. That's where I went.
That would be perfect for you.

23:26.810 --> 23:30.113
Ms. Abbott, ain't no way I'm going
to Urbana with this baby.

23:30.213 --> 23:33.219
Well, let's just look, okay?

23:35.016 --> 23:38.191
I know they have family housing.

23:40.822 --> 23:42.292
There.

23:42.392 --> 23:45.164
Yeah, maybe.

23:46.194 --> 23:49.365
Jasmine, you have to go
to college. Okay?

23:49.465 --> 23:53.936
I mean, that decision is more important
for your baby than anything else.

23:54.036 --> 23:55.872
If you were planning on going to college

23:55.972 --> 23:58.691
before you found out you were pregnant,
you should stick with it.

23:58.791 --> 24:01.444
What college is gonna accept
a pregnant girl from Englewood?

24:01.544 --> 24:04.818
We're gonna find one that does.

24:05.915 --> 24:08.421
Oh, sorry, Ms. Abbott.

24:09.551 --> 24:11.754
Hey, Grandma.

24:11.854 --> 24:14.824
With Ms. Abbott
doing some college stuff.

24:14.924 --> 24:17.960
Okay, hold on. Ms. Abbott,
can you drive me home?

24:18.060 --> 24:20.129
Yeah, sure.

24:20.229 --> 24:23.038
Okay, she said she's gonna
drive me home, Grandma.

24:24.083 --> 24:26.962
Okay, I will. See you tonight.

24:28.404 --> 24:31.510
- She said thanks.
- No problem.

24:33.175 --> 24:36.279
I bet you know everything
about having a baby.

24:36.379 --> 24:41.851
You got it all planned out, nursery painted,
always on your way to prenatal yoga.

24:41.951 --> 24:46.326
How is someone always
on their way to prenatal yoga?

24:47.722 --> 24:51.377
- Never even been to regular yoga.
- What? Didn't you take it in gym?

24:51.477 --> 24:55.732
No, I took square dancing. They didn't
have yoga when I was in high school.

24:56.102 --> 24:59.050
There was this yoga place on my way
home from work. I've just never been.

25:02.904 --> 25:07.443
Lifting up out of your left hip,
open your right knee toward the right,

25:07.543 --> 25:10.980
and rest your toes on the ground
with your heel above your ankle

25:11.080 --> 25:14.284
or bring the sole of your foot
to your inner calf.

25:14.384 --> 25:18.588
Feel free to lift the hips a little higher
if this feels too intense.

25:18.688 --> 25:22.508
Turn your heart center
toward the ceiling.

25:22.608 --> 25:24.981
Open your left knee toward the left.

25:25.311 --> 25:27.597
Give your knees a baby bend.

25:27.697 --> 25:30.733
- Sprawling with your fingers...
- Is it weird doing this with your teacher?

25:30.833 --> 25:32.539
Nah.

25:33.436 --> 25:35.904
Okay, it's a little weird.

25:36.472 --> 25:39.208
Rest your hands on your belly

25:39.308 --> 25:42.245
and feel free to close your eyes.

25:42.345 --> 25:45.114
Begin to deepen your breaths

25:45.214 --> 25:50.523
and focus on the life that is moving
and growing within your belly.

25:59.227 --> 26:03.466
- Is everything okay?
- I don't feel anything.

26:04.066 --> 26:06.672
Try closing your eyes.

26:11.640 --> 26:15.211
You know, I thought I would feel
different when I was pregnant.

26:15.811 --> 26:17.280
What do you mean?

26:17.380 --> 26:20.417
I mean, I don't know.
Do you feel different than before?

26:21.017 --> 26:24.454
Yeah. I think I feel pregnant.

26:24.554 --> 26:27.390
I've been having dreams about the baby.

26:27.640 --> 26:30.070
I don't have any dreams.

26:30.676 --> 26:32.829
- Never even changed a diaper.
- What?

26:32.929 --> 26:36.432
Yeah, I'm really unqualified
for motherhood.

26:36.532 --> 26:38.000
Don't you have brothers and sisters?

26:38.100 --> 26:41.504
No, my parents got divorced
when I was little.

26:41.604 --> 26:44.607
- Don't your friends have babies?
- No, not yet.

26:44.707 --> 26:46.924
But you're old.

26:47.610 --> 26:51.114
No, I'm not. I'm 30.

26:51.864 --> 26:54.451
My sister's 23, and she got two kids.

27:18.441 --> 27:21.121
Are you sad the school's closing?

27:21.877 --> 27:24.167
Yeah, I am.

27:24.739 --> 27:26.749
- You?
- Yeah.

27:26.849 --> 27:30.553
I'm glad I'm a senior, though,
so I don't have to worry about it too much.

27:30.653 --> 27:31.958
Right.

27:33.655 --> 27:37.096
So you gonna stop teaching
and just be a stay-at-home mom now?

27:38.493 --> 27:40.759
Stay-at-home mom.

27:41.793 --> 27:44.338
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

27:45.368 --> 27:50.647
You know, I was gonna apply for
this job at the Field Museum, but...

27:52.248 --> 27:54.844
now that I'm pregnant,
I don't think I can do both.

27:54.944 --> 27:59.510
- What's the job?
- Well, it was kind of my dream job.

28:00.750 --> 28:05.421
It would be helping to design the high school
science curriculum for the whole city.

28:05.521 --> 28:08.959
- That's cool.
- Yeah. Yeah.

28:11.327 --> 28:14.703
What about you? What's your...
what's your dream job?

28:18.332 --> 28:21.487
I think I want to go into business.

28:21.587 --> 28:25.130
I always wanted to be one of those ladies
that gets dressed up in a suit

28:25.230 --> 28:28.744
to go downtown, tell people what to do.

28:28.844 --> 28:31.133
Yeah, you'd be good at that.

28:32.047 --> 28:33.649
Yeah.

28:33.749 --> 28:35.788
It's right over here?

28:37.318 --> 28:41.513
All right, you ready to start working
on this college stuff tomorrow?

28:41.613 --> 28:44.894
- I'm ready to try, at least.
- Good.

28:45.494 --> 28:48.531
- Be safe getting home, Ms. Abbott.
- I will. Good night.

28:48.631 --> 28:50.443
Good night.

29:04.045 --> 29:07.016
- How you doing?
- Kevin, what you doing up?

29:07.116 --> 29:09.822
Monique, your son out of bed.

29:28.870 --> 29:34.021
Hey, so I was... I was thinking
about applying for a job for next fall.

29:35.944 --> 29:40.116
Don't you think that's kind of a lot
to take on right after the baby's born?

29:41.484 --> 29:45.045
I don't know. A lot of people do it.

29:47.189 --> 29:50.741
Yeah, I mean, I think we could talk
about it after the baby comes

29:50.841 --> 29:53.629
just 'cause then we'll finally know
what it's like to be parents,

29:53.729 --> 29:58.984
and we'll have a better idea of, you know,
what it's like for you to go back to work.

29:59.819 --> 30:01.460
Yeah.

30:02.908 --> 30:04.801
Hey, I just want you to enjoy
being a new mom

30:04.901 --> 30:07.344
without having to worry
about a bunch of stuff.

30:12.247 --> 30:13.905
Yeah.

30:18.020 --> 30:22.124
We had a month delay on our Link card
in October, and that really put me back.

30:22.224 --> 30:25.469
Now, I know about this already, Mrs. Taylor,
and we've already taken care of it.

30:25.569 --> 30:27.920
Yeah, well, we got the Link
back working, but you never...

30:28.020 --> 30:29.783
Auntie J, can I see your phone?

30:29.883 --> 30:32.121
Now, you know we can't do that,
Mrs. Taylor.

30:32.221 --> 30:35.005
Yeah, just the letter game.

30:35.105 --> 30:39.742
...because this one's pregnant,
and she's eating for two now.

30:39.842 --> 30:42.078
When the baby comes,
you can add it to your household,

30:42.178 --> 30:45.014
but I can't increase your money
before the baby's born.

30:45.114 --> 30:47.837
Listen, after the baby is born

30:47.937 --> 30:51.253
or if anything should change before then,
make sure you give me a call.

30:51.353 --> 30:53.889
Make sure you stop by the office. Okay?

30:53.989 --> 30:55.695
Okay.

31:00.829 --> 31:04.432
That man would ever answer the phone, we
wouldn't have to waste the whole afternoon

31:04.532 --> 31:07.829
coming down here
to listen to him tell us no.

31:09.270 --> 31:10.769
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi.

31:10.869 --> 31:13.109
I'm Steve. I'm gonna be performing
your ultrasound today.

31:13.209 --> 31:16.011
- Great.
- This is just a standard 20 week?

31:16.111 --> 31:18.013
Right. Well, technically 21 weeks.

31:18.113 --> 31:20.616
Okay, great. I'm gonna need you
to scoot back a little bit...

31:20.716 --> 31:21.896
Okay.

31:21.996 --> 31:25.455
If you could unbutton
the top button of your jeans there.

31:25.555 --> 31:27.990
Gonna have you tuck this towel in.

31:28.090 --> 31:30.161
- All right.
- Right.

31:30.261 --> 31:33.329
Were you hoping to find out
the sex of the baby today?

31:33.429 --> 31:35.632
Yes. We would like that.

31:35.732 --> 31:40.336
Okay, well, let me take a few measurements,
and then we will go exploring.

31:40.436 --> 31:42.334
All right.

31:43.639 --> 31:48.577
Right there, that is the baby's head.

31:48.677 --> 31:53.919
- Just measure that real quick.
- Holy shit. That's the baby's head.

31:57.685 --> 32:00.856
What is that little
blinking light there?

32:00.956 --> 32:02.725
That is the baby's heart,

32:02.825 --> 32:06.031
and it's going really strong,
so let me record that.

32:07.362 --> 32:10.199
Are you ready to find out the sex?

32:10.299 --> 32:11.334
Yeah.

32:11.455 --> 32:14.696
Congratulations,
you're having a baby girl.

32:15.237 --> 32:18.174
Oh, my God. It's a girl.

32:18.274 --> 32:20.242
Yeah, everything looks good,

32:20.542 --> 32:24.847
and, again, these aren't 100% accurate,
so sometimes there are some surprises...

32:24.947 --> 32:27.984
- but I am seeing all girl from right here.
- Right.

32:28.284 --> 32:29.986
Hey.

32:30.336 --> 32:32.075
Hey.

32:35.056 --> 32:38.227
Don't worry. This is a really
overwhelming visit for a lot of people.

32:38.327 --> 32:40.696
- Yeah.
- I'll just give you a few minutes.

32:40.796 --> 32:42.364
- Thank you.
- Sorry.

32:42.464 --> 32:44.541
Hey, hey.

32:44.891 --> 32:47.643
Talk to me. What's going on?
What's happening?

32:48.804 --> 32:50.356
Is this...

32:50.456 --> 32:53.776
- because she's a girl?
- No.

32:54.376 --> 32:57.115
Is it because it's a baby?

32:58.713 --> 33:00.512
Oh, baby.

33:00.612 --> 33:04.186
- We knew there was a baby in there.
- No, not really.

33:04.541 --> 33:06.822
Yeah, for a while now.

33:06.922 --> 33:11.027
But you can't see it, you know?

33:11.127 --> 33:15.364
- You can feel it, right?
- Yeah, but it's different when you see it...

33:15.464 --> 33:18.028
moving around like that.

33:19.468 --> 33:21.140
Yeah.

33:22.137 --> 33:25.142
I just thought... I don't know,
I thought we would, like, come here...

33:25.242 --> 33:27.743
the guy would be like, "I'm sorry...

33:27.843 --> 33:32.615
"You know, there's been a mistake. There...
the baby has no heart," or something.

33:32.715 --> 33:35.772
No, no. Okay, so...

33:36.454 --> 33:39.291
you're just relieved.

33:40.154 --> 33:43.896
I just... I feel like I just
found out I'm having a baby.

33:47.562 --> 33:49.835
We're having a baby.

33:50.565 --> 33:52.959
We're having a baby.

34:33.507 --> 34:36.775
All right, so our project
is about bee disappearance.

34:36.876 --> 34:40.215
So bees are flying insects
closely related to wasp and ants.

34:40.315 --> 34:44.152
They're known for their pollination
and their production of honey and beeswax.

34:44.253 --> 34:47.460
Bees are a monophyletic...

34:47.960 --> 34:50.839
lineage within the super family <i>Apoidea.</i>

34:50.938 --> 34:53.295
We still have to get all the information
on the board, though.

34:53.396 --> 34:56.547
Are you gonna print that off
later today? Okay. Good.

34:56.648 --> 35:00.903
So let's just look at this math.
So what are we doing? 55...

35:01.003 --> 35:03.273
- Bunnies.
- Okay, by 30. Okay.

35:03.373 --> 35:06.108
And is this... is this the diagram
you're gonna use for that?

35:06.408 --> 35:10.379
It looks good.
How are you gonna attach this?

35:10.479 --> 35:12.348
Oh, okay.

35:15.816 --> 35:17.286
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:17.386 --> 35:20.589
You help me clean up,
I'll help you get into college.

35:20.689 --> 35:21.825
Okay.

35:23.025 --> 35:25.684
My boyfriend's picking me up
when he gets off work.

35:25.784 --> 35:28.970
- Okay. Where does he work?
- In a warehouse.

35:29.070 --> 35:31.283
- Doing what?
- Moving boxes.

35:31.383 --> 35:33.369
Cool. That's great.

35:33.469 --> 35:37.873
Hey, what did he say when you told him
about the baby? Was he mad?

35:37.973 --> 35:40.109
Why would he be mad?

35:40.209 --> 35:42.611
I don't know. Was he excited?

35:42.711 --> 35:44.480
Yeah.

35:44.780 --> 35:50.119
So, I think that you should work on your
Illinois University application first.

35:50.219 --> 35:51.320
- Okay.
- All right.

35:51.420 --> 35:54.511
And then we'll work on Truman
and Northeastern

35:54.611 --> 35:56.559
- once we get that one sent off.
- Right.

35:56.659 --> 36:00.729
So what you need to do is talk to Mr. Hope
and get copies of your transcript.

36:00.829 --> 36:05.986
All right. And then go to all your teachers
and get those rec letters now, because...

36:06.086 --> 36:08.670
everybody waits until the last minute.

36:08.770 --> 36:11.422
And then there's the essay.
That's the most important part,

36:11.522 --> 36:13.761
so we really need to work on that.
Does it sound good?

36:13.861 --> 36:16.148
- Yes.
- Great.

36:18.914 --> 36:20.983
Oh, I got to go.

36:21.083 --> 36:22.863
Well, hey, I want to meet him.

36:23.385 --> 36:25.721
Okay. He gonna be shy.

36:26.421 --> 36:28.126
That's okay.

36:31.893 --> 36:34.963
Travis, this is Ms. Abbott.
Ms. Abbott, this is Travis.

36:35.063 --> 36:36.932
- How you doing?
- I'm good. How are you?

36:37.032 --> 36:38.667
I'm doing fine.

36:38.767 --> 36:41.837
- I told you he was gonna be shy.
- What you talking about?

36:41.937 --> 36:44.706
- You all get some work done?
- A little bit.

36:44.806 --> 36:47.126
- Want to get something to eat?
- Always.

36:47.226 --> 36:48.527
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

36:48.627 --> 36:51.217
- Bye.
- Bye, guys.

37:15.136 --> 37:16.975
What?

37:20.808 --> 37:23.898
John. I invented something.

37:23.998 --> 37:27.149
- What?
- I invented a pregnancy thing for pants.

37:27.249 --> 37:29.841
That's awesome. I'm gonna head out.
I'll see you after work.

37:29.941 --> 37:31.670
All right.

37:46.467 --> 37:50.139
- No, I'll take care of it. It's okay.
- Okay, I'ma hold you to that.

37:50.239 --> 37:55.144
You said today that you would babysit
my baby, so when I come calling, Teresa...

37:55.244 --> 37:57.942
- That's fine.
- Don't hit ignore.

38:01.983 --> 38:05.187
So as you can see, each pump
operates a little differently,

38:05.287 --> 38:08.794
but most of them are electrical.
Who has the manual pump?

38:17.399 --> 38:21.996
Take a deep breath in. Exhale.
Bend into your knees.

38:22.096 --> 38:24.473
Bend into your elbows.

38:24.573 --> 38:28.277
Broaden your chest by reaching
your elbows slightly back.

38:28.877 --> 38:32.013
Oh, feel it. She's kick...
yeah, right there.

38:32.113 --> 38:33.838
Hey.

38:35.917 --> 38:37.347
Good luck.

38:37.447 --> 38:39.248
Thanks.

39:06.013 --> 39:07.987
Give us some.

39:08.087 --> 39:09.919
Give us some. What you got?

39:10.519 --> 39:14.289
I wish. I wish I could rap like this,

39:14.389 --> 39:16.795
but I can't, so I'm stuck.

39:18.559 --> 39:20.262
How's little man?

39:20.362 --> 39:23.966
- How you know it's gonna be a boy?
- Just 'cause I do.

39:24.066 --> 39:27.869
I can't believe you making me
find out when I want to wait.

39:27.969 --> 39:31.009
You always be convincing me
of doing things.

39:40.981 --> 39:42.817
You gonna text me as soon as you know?

39:42.917 --> 39:45.687
For real? I thought
you were coming with me.

39:45.787 --> 39:48.893
Nah, I got to meet up
with Eddie and them.

39:51.793 --> 39:53.762
Thought we were doing this together.

39:53.862 --> 39:56.498
I already told you
I know it's gonna be a boy.

39:56.598 --> 39:58.619
Hey, I'll come by tonight.

40:12.713 --> 40:15.016
The heart is beating so fast.

40:15.116 --> 40:17.553
Nope, it's perfect.

40:17.953 --> 40:20.146
You sure you don't want to know
what it is?

40:20.246 --> 40:23.362
No. I want to be surprised.

41:41.335 --> 41:44.918
<i>Hi, this is Shelly Roa. Leave a message.</i>

41:46.107 --> 41:49.841
Hey, Shelly, this is Samantha Abbott.

41:50.345 --> 41:54.950
Listen, I was just wondering if you still
had any connections at the Field Museum.

41:55.050 --> 41:58.069
I'm thinking about applying
for a position there.

41:58.169 --> 42:02.758
Anyway, if you could give me a call back,
that'd be great, and I hope you're well.

42:02.858 --> 42:04.529
Bye.

42:21.560 --> 42:25.214
Save our schools! Save our schools!

42:25.314 --> 42:29.347
Save our schools! Save our schools...

42:34.989 --> 42:37.255
- So I got news.
- Yeah?

42:37.355 --> 42:40.391
- I got a job offer from Uno.
- A charter school?

42:40.491 --> 42:44.699
I know. I know, but there's not
that many positions at CPS.

42:44.799 --> 42:47.068
Well, hey, you know what? That's great.

42:47.168 --> 42:50.772
- You still thinking about the museum?
- Yeah, actually, I already applied.

42:50.872 --> 42:54.342
- Good for you.
- Yeah. I haven't told John yet.

42:54.442 --> 42:57.879
- Why?
- I don't want to jinx it.

42:57.979 --> 43:01.570
We sort of decided that I would
stay home with the baby, and...

43:01.670 --> 43:03.718
I don't want to get into
a fight if I don't have to.

43:03.818 --> 43:06.007
- Well, I think you'll get it.
- Oh, really?

43:06.107 --> 43:08.857
- Yes.
- Well, thank you.

43:08.957 --> 43:13.195
- So how's the belly?
- Oh, well, she is doing great.

43:13.295 --> 43:14.729
- It's a girl.
- It's a girl.

43:14.829 --> 43:16.857
- That's so great.
- I know.

43:17.357 --> 43:21.336
I'm really excited. I just... Oh, God,
I hope I don't mess her up.

43:21.436 --> 43:22.938
- You'll do great.
- You think so?

43:23.038 --> 43:25.311
- Yes.
- I hope so.

43:28.509 --> 43:30.345
Hello?

43:30.845 --> 43:32.850
I'm back here.

43:35.382 --> 43:38.017
Oh, my God.

43:40.087 --> 43:45.627
This is incredible. Honey, did you just
do this all by yourself, like, today?

43:45.727 --> 43:47.729
Yeah. Do you like it?

43:47.829 --> 43:49.898
I love it.

43:50.498 --> 43:53.793
You got a little... here.
You got a little schmutz.

43:53.893 --> 43:55.637
- Oh, yeah.
- Let me get that for you so...

43:55.737 --> 43:57.348
It'll happen.

43:57.448 --> 43:59.674
- I got it.
- Thank you.

43:59.774 --> 44:02.133
This is amazing. You're the best.

44:02.233 --> 44:04.217
- Yeah, I am.
- This is...

44:04.317 --> 44:07.349
- I can't even believe this, like...
- Wait, you got to see what else I got.

44:07.449 --> 44:09.758
- There's more? John, that...
- Oh, there's more.

44:09.858 --> 44:13.054
So I know I said I don't want
the whole place to feel, like, too girly...

44:13.154 --> 44:15.790
- Yeah.
- But she is a girl, right?

44:15.890 --> 44:17.325
Yeah.

44:17.425 --> 44:19.094
So.

44:19.194 --> 44:22.473
Pink dinosaurs. Oh, I love 'em.

44:22.573 --> 44:23.624
- Right?
- I love 'em.

44:23.724 --> 44:26.166
- I was so psyched when I saw these.
- They're perfect.

44:26.266 --> 44:29.762
- I can't even believe they exist.
- Well, technically, they're extinct.

44:34.441 --> 44:37.379
<i>Hi, Samantha. This is Katie
calling from the Field Museum.</i>

44:37.479 --> 44:42.667
<i>We recently got your application
for the education coordinator position,</i>

44:42.767 --> 44:44.886
<i>and we would love
to set up an interview.</i>

44:44.986 --> 44:47.656
<i>Give me a call back.
We can set up a time.</i>

44:47.756 --> 44:50.245
<i>Thanks so much. Bye-bye.</i>

44:52.893 --> 44:54.329
Hey, Ms. Abbott.

44:54.429 --> 44:57.921
Hey, Jasmine.
I thought Travis was dropping you off.

44:58.021 --> 45:01.820
Well, that didn't exactly work out.
We stopped talking.

45:01.920 --> 45:03.738
Stopped talking?

45:03.838 --> 45:06.973
- We broke up.
- Shit.

45:08.209 --> 45:11.196
It wasn't a fight or anything.

45:11.296 --> 45:14.015
I just realized I can't be with him.

45:14.115 --> 45:17.919
- Did he cheat on you?
- No, it ain't even like that.

45:18.419 --> 45:20.280
He's just...

45:20.380 --> 45:22.194
getting drunk with his friends,

45:22.957 --> 45:27.901
not taking work seriously,
not taking the baby seriously.

45:29.197 --> 45:32.270
You know his mama still buy his clothes?

45:35.266 --> 45:39.293
He ain't do anything bad.
He just needs to grow up.

45:39.393 --> 45:41.599
He not grown.

45:42.210 --> 45:45.650
Can't imagine having kids
with my high school boyfriend.

45:48.298 --> 45:51.340
I thought when I got pregnant
that he would straighten up

45:51.440 --> 45:53.164
and do right and everything.

45:55.123 --> 46:00.629
He's still gonna help out with the baby,
and I think he'll be a good father.

46:00.729 --> 46:05.166
I just can't take on this baby and him.

46:05.366 --> 46:07.335
I can't worry about...

46:07.435 --> 46:10.728
waking him up for work on time
and nagging him to get home.

46:10.828 --> 46:13.059
I just can't think about that, you know?

46:17.811 --> 46:19.672
Am I being stupid?

46:21.182 --> 46:24.474
Jasmine, you are anything but stupid.

46:34.595 --> 46:38.479
I just picked out a few things
I thought were cute.

46:38.579 --> 46:42.304
Mom, you bought her
three bags of clothes.

46:42.804 --> 46:44.939
I can't help it. I'm excited, Samantha.

46:45.039 --> 46:48.076
I just... I haven't even bought
any clothes for the baby yet.

46:48.176 --> 46:49.995
Great. Now you don't have to.

46:50.095 --> 46:53.348
Well, you know, I want to,
though, Mom, you know...

46:53.448 --> 46:56.218
and it would be silly because you've
bought enough clothes for five kids.

46:56.318 --> 46:58.086
Samantha, by the time
you get around to it,

46:58.186 --> 47:00.589
the kid's gonna come out
with nothing to wear.

47:00.689 --> 47:04.459
You're spending all your time with a teenager
instead of focusing on your own baby.

47:04.559 --> 47:08.244
Mom, Jasmine is my friend, okay?
I'm helping her.

47:08.344 --> 47:10.899
Right. And it's pretty strange
to be friends with a 17-year-old.

47:10.999 --> 47:13.535
You know what, Mom, that's none of your
business, and you know what else?

47:13.635 --> 47:16.808
This is my baby, okay, Mom?
This is not your baby.

47:19.507 --> 47:22.277
Fine. Don't take the clothes.

47:22.377 --> 47:24.045
Give them to the poor girl.

47:24.145 --> 47:26.264
- Mom.
- What?

47:27.215 --> 47:30.251
You want to help your friend,
and she probably needs them.

47:30.351 --> 47:33.833
Just because Jasmine doesn't have a lot
of money doesn't mean she has shitty taste.

47:36.157 --> 47:39.934
Ladies and gentlemen, listen to me.

47:40.395 --> 47:42.030
Listen to me.

47:42.130 --> 47:46.301
You must have 25 passing credits
by May 29th.

47:46.401 --> 47:50.138
If you don't have 25 passing credits,
you will not receive a cap and gown,

47:50.238 --> 47:52.307
and you will not walk across the stage.

47:52.707 --> 47:56.003
If you have any questions about that,
you can come see me in my office.

47:57.212 --> 48:00.649
Now give your attention
to Principal Clements, please.

48:00.749 --> 48:03.088
Good afternoon, seniors.

48:08.822 --> 48:10.959
Settle down. Settle down now.

48:11.059 --> 48:13.928
I am here to congratulate a few folks

48:14.028 --> 48:17.999
who have received college
admissions letters this week.

48:18.099 --> 48:21.372
Kiara White, please stand up.

48:23.105 --> 48:25.443
Bianca Jones.

48:27.208 --> 48:29.380
Terry Lewis.

48:30.712 --> 48:33.065
Kevin Jackson.

48:36.951 --> 48:38.475
And...

48:38.575 --> 48:41.452
Tijuan Anderson.

48:43.491 --> 48:46.945
Congratulations to you all. Yes, yes.

48:47.045 --> 48:51.432
Now, we are posting your acceptances
on our front board,

48:51.532 --> 48:56.441
so when you receive something in the mail,
please, please let the front office know.

49:24.531 --> 49:28.036
- Hi, baby.
- Say hi, Josephine.

49:28.136 --> 49:30.505
- How old is she?
- Four months.

49:30.605 --> 49:32.674
She's so cute.

49:32.774 --> 49:34.976
- When are you due?
- August.

49:35.076 --> 49:38.647
You got to get one of these carriers.
It's the best thing I got.

49:39.547 --> 49:42.684
You can get a used one
online way cheaper.

49:47.154 --> 49:48.515
No.

49:48.615 --> 49:50.231
Yes.

49:51.925 --> 49:53.798
Duchess.

49:57.231 --> 49:59.303
Is she dying?

50:03.536 --> 50:06.907
- Hey.
- Hey. Grandma left you a plate.

50:07.007 --> 50:08.746
Okay.

50:34.434 --> 50:37.171
Jasmine. Hey.

50:37.271 --> 50:39.875
- Gosh, I'm so excited for you.
- Me too.

50:39.975 --> 50:41.824
Did they send you anything
about scholarships?

50:41.924 --> 50:43.848
- They sent me a whole packet.
- Oh, my gosh.

50:43.948 --> 50:47.549
We have to make an appointment for
the financial aid office when we get there.

50:47.649 --> 50:49.767
That still works for you, right?
Your grandma's okay with that?

50:49.867 --> 50:53.456
Yeah. Oh, my grandma
wanted me to give this to you.

50:56.920 --> 50:59.617
It's for your baby shower.

50:59.717 --> 51:01.633
I will definitely be there.

51:32.859 --> 51:35.829
We were all really impressed
with your resume.

51:35.929 --> 51:40.001
Thanks. I'm really impressed
with your education department.

51:40.101 --> 51:43.004
You know Shelly Roa. I saw
that she gave you a recommendation.

51:43.104 --> 51:46.941
Yeah, I do. I actually met her last year.
I came here for a teacher workshop.

51:47.041 --> 51:49.210
She's... she's great.
She loves you guys.

51:49.310 --> 51:51.112
Well, we love her.

51:51.212 --> 51:53.401
So tell me a bit about your background.

51:53.501 --> 51:56.217
How did you get involved
in teaching science?

51:56.317 --> 52:00.455
Well, to be honest, I kind of fell
into the teaching aspect of it.

52:00.555 --> 52:04.351
I got my degree in biology,
and then I applied to Teach For America

52:04.451 --> 52:07.428
as a way to beef up my resume
before grad school,

52:07.528 --> 52:11.866
but I just fell for teaching, and now
I'm just as passionate about both.

52:11.966 --> 52:16.270
That's excellent. What do you think
you can bring to the coordinator position

52:16.370 --> 52:18.239
with your experience
as a high school teacher?

52:18.339 --> 52:22.110
You know, I think that
my excitement for this position

52:22.210 --> 52:25.113
comes from my limitations as a teacher.

52:25.213 --> 52:27.124
I love my students,

52:27.224 --> 52:31.652
but I can't always do the things
that I think will really help them learn,

52:31.752 --> 52:36.524
so... the idea of working
from a macro level

52:36.624 --> 52:39.360
and influencing the science curriculum,

52:39.460 --> 52:43.239
potentially affecting all
of the students in the city,

52:43.639 --> 52:45.800
just... it really excites me.

52:45.900 --> 52:47.668
Us too.

52:47.768 --> 52:51.171
So this is a full-time position.

52:51.271 --> 52:54.709
- Right.
- Paid vacation, benefits, 401k.

52:54.809 --> 52:59.414
We would be looking to have somebody
take over at the end of summer.

52:59.514 --> 53:03.635
- Sorry, so the start date is?
- Realistically, August 1st.

53:06.218 --> 53:09.293
So you may have noticed
that I am pregnant.

53:10.991 --> 53:16.330
Actually, I have a long list of things I am
not allowed to discuss in an interview,

53:16.430 --> 53:21.695
- and that is number one.
- No, I know. It... it's just...

53:21.795 --> 53:27.008
you seem like a real person,
and I think I would be great at this job.

53:27.108 --> 53:30.389
It's just I cannot start August 1st.

53:31.045 --> 53:33.314
- When are you due?
- July 24th.

53:33.414 --> 53:36.786
- And is this your first?
- Yeah.

53:38.386 --> 53:39.720
I will be honest.

53:39.820 --> 53:43.124
- It gets really crazy here in August.
- Right.

53:43.224 --> 53:47.862
We are getting ready to launch our new
curriculum at the start of the school year.

53:47.962 --> 53:50.498
This is an incredible place to work,

53:50.598 --> 53:55.303
but I don't know that I could have
done it when my son was first born.

53:55.403 --> 53:57.972
If we were talking
about a December start date,

53:58.072 --> 54:03.294
I would say no problem,
but with a week-old baby...

54:03.394 --> 54:07.914
- I'm speaking for me personally.
- No, no. I... I get it.

54:08.014 --> 54:11.285
And I really appreciate you saying that.

54:11.385 --> 54:14.298
It just really sucks to hear.

54:30.976 --> 54:32.677
I hate that clown.

54:34.441 --> 54:37.835
- Yeah, he's bad.
- I mean, get him out of here.

54:38.412 --> 54:40.221
Hey.

54:40.321 --> 54:43.384
What's going on over there?
You have a bad day?

54:43.484 --> 54:46.418
I'm just really mad
about being pregnant today.

54:47.488 --> 54:49.164
Why?

54:50.391 --> 54:54.156
I applied for a job I can't have.

54:55.229 --> 54:56.898
Wait, what job?

54:56.998 --> 55:01.536
I interviewed for a job
at the Field Museum, and I nailed it.

55:01.636 --> 55:03.504
And you didn't tell me about it.

55:03.604 --> 55:05.773
Well, I'm... I'm telling you
about it right now.

55:05.873 --> 55:08.726
What are you doing applying for jobs?
You said you were gonna stay home.

55:08.826 --> 55:11.863
- That wasn't decided.
- That's what we agreed on.

55:12.413 --> 55:14.621
Okay, fine, John, you know what?

55:14.721 --> 55:16.717
You're right, I'm just gonna stay home
and take care of the baby,

55:16.817 --> 55:18.820
so you don't even have
to worry about it anymore.

55:18.920 --> 55:21.855
I'm just gonna be a wife
and a mother, and that's it.

55:21.955 --> 55:24.458
- Samantha, you have got to stop this.
- That'll be my life.

55:24.558 --> 55:27.878
That is what you want.
I mean, you want me to stay home.

55:27.978 --> 55:31.099
It's not what I want.
It's what made sense, okay?

55:31.199 --> 55:35.536
You going back to work right after having
a baby is completely unrealistic.

55:35.636 --> 55:38.739
Is it unrealistic?
Tell me how it's unrealistic

55:38.839 --> 55:40.775
that someone with a baby can work.

55:40.875 --> 55:44.295
In fact, tell the nation of working
mothers how they're all wrong.

55:44.395 --> 55:47.452
I'm not saying they're wrong.
I'm saying...

55:49.449 --> 55:53.454
Listen, we have to talk
about stuff like this, okay?

55:53.554 --> 55:56.390
You can't make decisions like this
by yourself anymore.

55:56.490 --> 55:58.593
These are decisions
about our whole family,

55:58.693 --> 56:01.028
and I don't know why
you're so hell-bent on working.

56:01.128 --> 56:03.210
This could be a nice break for you.

56:03.310 --> 56:06.701
You think that staying home
with an infant is a break? Really?

56:06.801 --> 56:08.869
Well, then why don't you just
quit your job and do it?

56:08.969 --> 56:11.506
I mean, I can't do everything
for this baby.

56:11.606 --> 56:13.508
No one's asking you
to do everything, all right?

56:13.608 --> 56:17.511
I can't breast-feed a newborn.
Working is something I can do.

56:17.611 --> 56:19.547
And apparently it's not anything
I can do anymore,

56:19.647 --> 56:21.815
so just put another point
on the board for men.

56:21.915 --> 56:25.955
Yes, great, more points. I'll be sure
and let all the other worker men know.

56:28.054 --> 56:30.069
You know what? Maybe...

56:30.169 --> 56:33.428
maybe we fucked up, John.
Maybe we shouldn't have done this.

56:34.228 --> 56:37.734
- What, gotten married?
- Yeah, gotten married.

56:38.466 --> 56:42.403
You know what, Samantha, whether or not
you think we're soul mates right now

56:42.503 --> 56:45.740
doesn't change the fact that we still
have a child on the way, okay?

56:45.840 --> 56:48.512
So you might want to just get over it.

57:35.221 --> 57:37.595
- Hey, Ms. Abbott.
- Hey.

57:39.125 --> 57:42.667
- I brought snacks.
- Yummy.

57:47.267 --> 57:51.075
- So you ready to see your new school?
- Yes, ma'am.

57:54.374 --> 57:57.434
Okay, so we have the tour
scheduled for 11:00.

57:57.534 --> 58:00.081
- Okay.
- I think it's gonna be really fun,

58:00.181 --> 58:02.950
and then we have an appointment
at the admissions office

58:03.050 --> 58:05.820
to go over financial aid
and family housing,

58:05.920 --> 58:08.886
and then when we're done I really
want to take you to Quatro's for pizza

58:09.625 --> 58:11.914
'cause it is so good.

58:12.326 --> 58:13.765
Okay.

58:20.133 --> 58:22.737
- What are you doing?
- Pouring my juice in here.

58:22.837 --> 58:24.987
And you're gonna do what with it?

58:25.373 --> 58:26.594
I'm gonna drink it.

58:28.108 --> 58:33.080
Oh, my God, no. Jasmine, no.
Don't do that. Don't do that.

58:33.180 --> 58:35.316
- Oh, my... stop. No, stop it.
- Yes.

58:35.716 --> 58:39.219
- Oh, my gosh, that's disgusting. Stop it.
- It's so good.

58:39.319 --> 58:42.888
It smells so bad in here. I'm gonna pull over.
No, you need to get rid of that.

58:42.998 --> 58:44.774
- I'm getting... I'm gonna throw up.
- What you want me to do with it?

58:44.874 --> 58:47.549
I'm pulling over, and I want you
to get it out of the car, okay?

58:47.649 --> 58:50.613
- No, no, throw it out of the car.
- Where do you want me to put it?

58:50.713 --> 58:52.733
- Litter! Litter!
- Throw it on the ground?

58:52.833 --> 58:56.807
Just throw it. Just throw it in the ditch.
I don't even care. Just get rid of it.

58:56.907 --> 58:59.778
Just go, go. Go, go, go, drive.

58:59.878 --> 59:02.331
We're gonna get arrested.

59:03.376 --> 59:05.513
Oh, my gosh, it still smells in here.

59:05.613 --> 59:08.045
- It was so good though.
- It smells so bad.

59:31.237 --> 59:33.281
It's beautiful, right?

59:33.807 --> 59:35.429
Yeah.

59:37.044 --> 59:38.913
Let's go.

59:39.413 --> 59:43.017
So how's your visit been?
Did you take a tour with us today?

59:43.217 --> 59:44.819
- Yeah.
- Great.

59:44.919 --> 59:47.121
Yeah, we actually had
a few questions about housing.

59:47.221 --> 59:50.524
Great. Did you get to see
one of our residence halls?

59:50.624 --> 59:53.288
We did, yes, but Jasmine is pregnant,

59:53.388 --> 59:56.297
and she's gonna be bringing
her baby with her next fall.

59:56.397 --> 59:59.288
We wondered if it would be possible
to tour the family housing?

01:00:01.635 --> 01:00:05.673
Well, those are only available
to students in our graduate program.

01:00:06.373 --> 01:00:10.231
No, I spoke to the housing department
on the phone. They didn't mention that.

01:00:10.331 --> 01:00:12.179
They must have misunderstood.

01:00:12.279 --> 01:00:15.115
Undergraduates do not have
access to family housing.

01:00:15.215 --> 01:00:19.820
If a student is attending with a child,
they generally find housing off campus.

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:23.724
But she can't get financial aid
for off-campus housing.

01:00:24.124 --> 01:00:25.292
Correct.

01:00:25.392 --> 01:00:28.778
Okay, well, that's crazy.
How is she gonna afford that?

01:00:29.997 --> 01:00:34.135
- You can't make exceptions for this?
- We don't make exceptions.

01:00:34.785 --> 01:00:38.055
Even if we did, the family housing
has a long waiting list.

01:00:38.305 --> 01:00:41.679
Even graduate students
have a difficult time getting in.

01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:45.012
I'm sorry.

01:00:45.112 --> 01:00:49.794
This university is not the most accommodating
to students in your situation.

01:00:50.951 --> 01:00:52.957
Thank you for your time.

01:01:00.393 --> 01:01:02.029
This is ridiculous.

01:01:02.129 --> 01:01:06.200
Can you believe this? Now we're gonna
have to come back and look at apartments,

01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:08.869
and all the good ones are probably
gonna be gone already.

01:01:08.969 --> 01:01:11.606
Are you out of your mind?
I can't go here.

01:01:11.706 --> 01:01:14.198
What, you're just gonna
give up on college now

01:01:14.298 --> 01:01:16.595
because some dumb admissions lady
can't get her shit straight?

01:01:16.695 --> 01:01:18.478
You're the one who can't get
her shit straight.

01:01:18.578 --> 01:01:21.832
You're the one who messed up
about the housing, not her.

01:01:22.182 --> 01:01:25.586
Hey, look, okay. We'll figure it out.
They have a work studies program.

01:01:25.686 --> 01:01:28.088
You can get a job and pay
for your apartment that way.

01:01:28.188 --> 01:01:32.260
How am I going to go to school
and work and take care of my baby?

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:34.295
Okay, okay, look,
how about this, all right?

01:01:34.395 --> 01:01:37.998
You... you... you stay here
during the week.

01:01:38.098 --> 01:01:41.676
You... you get financial aid.
You stay in the dorms,

01:01:41.776 --> 01:01:44.739
and your grandmother takes the baby,
and you can go home on the weekends.

01:01:44.839 --> 01:01:48.566
I mean, there is a train that goes straight
to Chicago. Go home and be with the baby...

01:01:48.666 --> 01:01:52.446
You want me to leave my baby
three hours away for the next four years?

01:01:52.546 --> 01:01:55.116
You... you wouldn't be leaving it.
It would be with your grand...

01:01:55.216 --> 01:01:58.090
No. No way.

01:01:58.652 --> 01:02:02.022
Well, why not? It's an option.
I'm just trying to think of options here.

01:02:02.122 --> 01:02:05.259
Can you stop talking to me?
Are you crazy?

01:02:05.359 --> 01:02:07.595
I'm not about to leave
my newborn all week long

01:02:07.695 --> 01:02:09.497
while I live in a dorm with a roommate

01:02:09.597 --> 01:02:12.166
and try to pretend to be
some normal college freshman.

01:02:12.266 --> 01:02:16.404
Jasmine, this is a really
great opportunity for you, okay?

01:02:16.754 --> 01:02:19.039
And it is gonna be better
for your baby in the long run

01:02:19.139 --> 01:02:21.875
if you take advantage of this now.

01:02:21.975 --> 01:02:24.119
Would you leave your baby?

01:02:29.716 --> 01:02:32.367
I don't belong here, okay?

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:36.123
Even if I did get into the family
housing, I'd still be here alone

01:02:36.223 --> 01:02:41.228
without my friends, without my family,
trying to raise a baby on my own,

01:02:41.328 --> 01:02:43.464
and where would you be?

01:02:43.564 --> 01:02:47.138
In Chicago thinking about what a great thing
you did for that pregnant girl.

01:02:50.153 --> 01:02:52.476
How could you say that?

01:02:53.007 --> 01:02:55.709
God, Jasmine, I have spent so much time

01:02:55.809 --> 01:02:57.612
trying to get you into this place.

01:02:58.812 --> 01:03:01.181
Do you know how many students I have?

01:03:01.281 --> 01:03:05.986
You are this close, and you don't even
want to work a little bit harder to get it,

01:03:06.086 --> 01:03:10.102
and that is just so
disappointing, Jasmine.

01:03:10.691 --> 01:03:12.993
You don't even know disappointment.

01:03:13.093 --> 01:03:16.547
You've gotten everything you've ever wanted
in your life. My whole life is this shit.

01:03:16.647 --> 01:03:19.833
My whole life is disappointment.

01:03:22.001 --> 01:03:24.104
You set me up.

01:03:24.204 --> 01:03:27.705
I trusted you, and that's on me.

01:03:28.676 --> 01:03:31.266
I just feel so stupid
for letting you do that.

01:03:33.446 --> 01:03:35.856
Listen, Jasmine, I didn't...

01:03:36.283 --> 01:03:39.420
I don't need your help anymore, okay?

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.713
I can do it from here.

01:04:18.024 --> 01:04:20.697
You need to use the bathroom
or anything?

01:04:53.459 --> 01:04:56.133
<i>This is John. Leave a message.</i>

01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:10.796
Jasmine, I'm really sorry.

01:06:12.104 --> 01:06:14.734
Did I ever tell you about my mother?

01:06:17.610 --> 01:06:18.916
No.

01:06:20.079 --> 01:06:23.852
She raised me and my sister
until I was 11.

01:06:25.319 --> 01:06:27.588
Then my grandma took us,

01:06:27.688 --> 01:06:29.139
and...

01:06:29.239 --> 01:06:33.761
I don't talk about my mom much
'cause I tried so hard to put it past me,

01:06:33.861 --> 01:06:37.234
but it was hard, Ms. Abbott.

01:06:39.632 --> 01:06:42.336
There were times when things were fine,

01:06:42.436 --> 01:06:46.794
and there were other times
when she'd be so strung out.

01:06:48.442 --> 01:06:51.345
Different men always in the house.

01:06:55.381 --> 01:06:57.231
One time...

01:06:57.331 --> 01:07:01.224
all the furniture was out on the street
when I came home from school.

01:07:03.289 --> 01:07:06.029
We had to sleep on the floor.

01:07:07.259 --> 01:07:09.474
When I was nine,

01:07:11.031 --> 01:07:14.545
we lived without electricity
for six months.

01:07:14.902 --> 01:07:15.937
Oh, Jasmine. I didn't...

01:07:16.066 --> 01:07:19.143
I'm not telling you for you
to feel bad for me.

01:07:22.224 --> 01:07:24.111
Like I said...

01:07:25.655 --> 01:07:27.784
I'm past it.

01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:30.085
It's behind me.

01:07:32.051 --> 01:07:34.721
But I want you to know
that I made a choice

01:07:34.821 --> 01:07:38.091
to be a mother to my child
better than I ever had,

01:07:38.191 --> 01:07:43.219
and I'm not about to just toss it aside
and keep going like it doesn't exist.

01:07:46.732 --> 01:07:49.004
I'm really sorry.

01:08:40.019 --> 01:08:42.158
Hi, are you home?

01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:58.008
- Sam, you want honey in your tea?
- Please.

01:09:04.276 --> 01:09:06.013
Thanks, Mom.

01:09:06.113 --> 01:09:08.018
Of course.

01:09:11.984 --> 01:09:15.171
I think I really screwed
things up with Jasmine.

01:09:19.792 --> 01:09:23.929
I have been spending so much time

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:26.700
trying to help this girl on her path,

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:29.679
and she doesn't need my help.

01:09:30.804 --> 01:09:33.220
She's got it all figured out.

01:09:33.974 --> 01:09:36.888
I'm the one who doesn't know
what she's doing,

01:09:38.478 --> 01:09:41.603
and I just... I wish
I could have taken this job.

01:09:42.716 --> 01:09:46.054
- It would have been so perfect for me.
- Would it be, really?

01:09:47.354 --> 01:09:50.932
You have to leave your baby
with someone else while you worked,

01:09:51.091 --> 01:09:53.693
which is really tough to do. Trust me.

01:09:53.792 --> 01:09:56.910
- Well, you worked when I was a baby.
- I know.

01:09:57.010 --> 01:10:01.107
And I loved my job, but it was still
really tough for me not to be with you.

01:10:03.370 --> 01:10:05.829
As much as I wish it weren't true,
it's a sacrifice either way

01:10:05.929 --> 01:10:08.894
whether you go to work
or whether you stay at home.

01:10:11.311 --> 01:10:14.351
But let me tell you, it's so worth it.

01:10:16.348 --> 01:10:18.188
You're gonna be a great mom.

01:10:26.158 --> 01:10:29.006
I was wondering when
you were gonna come home.

01:10:29.796 --> 01:10:32.680
Well, here I am.

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:36.290
Hi.

01:10:37.504 --> 01:10:39.072
Hi.

01:10:39.172 --> 01:10:44.529
- Are we still in a fight?
- I hope not. I am in so many fights.

01:10:44.629 --> 01:10:45.779
Your mom?

01:10:46.079 --> 01:10:48.381
No, actually. Jasmine.

01:10:48.481 --> 01:10:51.628
The college trip
was a bit of a train wreck.

01:10:52.585 --> 01:10:55.225
Sam, I'm sorry.

01:10:57.823 --> 01:10:59.925
I don't know, John.

01:11:00.025 --> 01:11:02.429
I'm kind of freaking out.

01:11:02.529 --> 01:11:05.465
Nothing is going as planned. Nothing.

01:11:05.565 --> 01:11:07.604
What do you mean?

01:11:09.202 --> 01:11:13.540
I just... I don't want my whole identity
to be someone's mom.

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:16.818
Hey, look, I'm sorry. I...

01:11:17.726 --> 01:11:20.748
I hope you don't feel like I've been trying
to pressure you into that, you know,

01:11:20.848 --> 01:11:24.662
- 'cause that's not what I'm trying to do.
- I know. I know.

01:11:25.879 --> 01:11:27.579
I...

01:11:27.679 --> 01:11:30.390
I want to stay home with the baby.

01:11:30.490 --> 01:11:33.493
You know, at least...
at least at first, but I just...

01:11:33.593 --> 01:11:36.214
I think I've been so...

01:11:37.001 --> 01:11:40.821
scared to say that out loud because...

01:11:41.995 --> 01:11:47.369
I think I'm afraid if I stop working,
I'm gonna lose myself.

01:11:48.607 --> 01:11:50.877
You know what, I wish...
I wish it was enough for me.

01:11:50.977 --> 01:11:54.915
I wish I could stay home with her
every day and it be...

01:11:55.015 --> 01:12:00.317
it would be enough for me, but it's not,
and I just... I feel so guilty about that.

01:12:01.954 --> 01:12:04.781
You know, I just think that I need...

01:12:04.881 --> 01:12:08.661
to know that you're gonna
be there for me to support me

01:12:08.761 --> 01:12:11.665
when I'm ready to get my career back.

01:12:11.765 --> 01:12:14.745
Yes. Absolutely.

01:12:15.268 --> 01:12:17.571
We're partners.

01:12:17.971 --> 01:12:19.706
Right?

01:12:19.806 --> 01:12:21.578
Come here.

01:12:24.710 --> 01:12:26.613
And who knows, you know?

01:12:26.713 --> 01:12:31.719
We might have to just send the baby
to work, and then we stay at home.

01:12:32.119 --> 01:12:34.017
I'm serious.

01:12:34.552 --> 01:12:36.430
- I like that.
- Yeah?

01:12:36.530 --> 01:12:37.725
- Yeah.
- Oh, good.

01:12:37.825 --> 01:12:40.477
What do you think, little person?

01:12:40.577 --> 01:12:43.134
You ready to go work at a factory?

01:12:43.930 --> 01:12:47.170
I think she's almost ready
to come out of there.

01:12:47.934 --> 01:12:51.506
Well, then, it's a good thing
we've got everything figured out?

01:12:53.006 --> 01:12:56.675
Get in here. Get in here.

01:13:03.916 --> 01:13:09.322
Okay, ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

01:13:09.422 --> 01:13:13.830
five, four, three, two, one!

01:13:18.666 --> 01:13:22.836
<i>Remember, before you leave these
hallowed halls, clean out your lockers.</i>

01:13:22.936 --> 01:13:26.306
<i>They should be as beautiful when you leave
as they were when you arrived.</i>

01:13:26.406 --> 01:13:27.907
<i>Have a safe and active summer.</i>

01:13:28.007 --> 01:13:30.343
Well, that's it.

01:13:30.443 --> 01:13:33.046
Usually I'm excited.
Today I'm kind of sad.

01:13:33.146 --> 01:13:36.472
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna miss y'all.

01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:40.820
- Hey, did... did Jamal graduate?
- What do you think?

01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:44.529
- I'm gonna miss you.
- Yeah, you too.

01:13:44.824 --> 01:13:48.262
- Okay, I'm gonna go pack up.
- Okay, me too.

01:13:49.162 --> 01:13:51.398
...there's this racist lady,
and she's like,

01:13:51.498 --> 01:13:54.327
"I can eat my food 'cause
I hear you talking on me."

01:13:54.427 --> 01:13:57.337
I'm like, "I don't really know
what that means," and then her...

01:13:57.437 --> 01:14:00.677
- Bye, Ms. Abbott.
- Bye.

01:14:14.937 --> 01:14:18.625
Get the overnight bag.
Where... where is the overnight bag?

01:14:18.725 --> 01:14:22.079
I have it. I'm just checking it.
Where's the birth plan?

01:14:22.179 --> 01:14:24.732
- I can't find the birth plan.
- Fuck the birth plan. Let's go!

01:14:25.232 --> 01:14:29.039
- Are you ready? I'm not ready!
- For what?

01:14:29.883 --> 01:14:31.671
- God damn it!
- Just breathe. Just breathe.

01:14:31.771 --> 01:14:34.925
- Breathe, breathe, breath, breathe.
- No, John. John, I need to poop.

01:14:35.025 --> 01:14:38.678
No, no, it's the baby, okay?
Don't poop. It's not poop, it's the baby.

01:14:38.778 --> 01:14:42.249
Oh, God, I need the drugs.
I need drugs. I need something.

01:14:42.349 --> 01:14:45.092
- I can't do this. It hurts so much.
- Waiting to happen.

01:14:46.186 --> 01:14:50.424
I need an epidural. Hey, wait.
Can you get me an epidural?

01:14:50.524 --> 01:14:53.393
Let's see where we are first
before we do anything else.

01:14:53.493 --> 01:14:55.946
Okay, not on the ground.
Let me get you up in the bed.

01:14:56.046 --> 01:14:57.986
- How long has she been laboring?
- About three hours.

01:14:58.086 --> 01:15:02.001
- All right, sweetie, come on.
- Wait, I need to take my underwear off.

01:15:02.101 --> 01:15:05.202
- Okay.
- My underwear. I can't get it.

01:15:06.939 --> 01:15:09.159
Okay, Samantha, you're gonna
feel a little bit of pressure.

01:15:09.259 --> 01:15:12.512
- I just want to see how far along we are.
- Just get it for me, please.

01:15:12.612 --> 01:15:14.814
- Get the midwife.
- What, why? Is it time?

01:15:14.914 --> 01:15:18.485
Samantha, honey, it's too late
for an epidural. You're ready to push.

01:15:18.585 --> 01:15:20.190
Fuck.

01:15:25.057 --> 01:15:28.395
Okay, Samantha, the head is out.
One more big push for the shoulders, okay?

01:15:28.495 --> 01:15:32.064
When you have another contraction,
give me one more big push.

01:15:32.499 --> 01:15:36.303
Oh, you're so nice. I thought you were
going to be mean, but you're so nice.

01:15:36.403 --> 01:15:39.002
- Sam, I just felt her head.
- Do you want to feel the baby's head?

01:15:39.102 --> 01:15:41.796
No, I just want to lie here.

01:15:43.695 --> 01:15:45.381
God.

01:16:08.867 --> 01:16:10.804
Can you see her?

01:16:10.904 --> 01:16:12.509
Where is she?

01:16:17.509 --> 01:16:19.341
Hi.

01:16:20.714 --> 01:16:22.419
Hi.

01:16:32.858 --> 01:16:34.337
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:16:40.733 --> 01:16:42.772
Do you hate that?

01:16:46.071 --> 01:16:48.294
Okay, okay, okay.

01:16:51.945 --> 01:16:53.687
Hi.

01:16:55.181 --> 01:16:57.120
Hey, baby.

01:17:26.478 --> 01:17:29.294
Hi, baby.

01:17:29.394 --> 01:17:33.019
- So glad you made it.
- I hope it's okay that I came.

01:17:33.119 --> 01:17:36.826
You were invited, weren't you?
Come on in here.

01:17:39.658 --> 01:17:41.297
Hello.

01:17:42.494 --> 01:17:45.424
You can set your gift on the table.
Everybody's in the backyard.

01:17:45.524 --> 01:17:47.370
Okay, thanks.

01:17:52.938 --> 01:17:56.007
Here, you... you want it back? Okay.

01:17:56.507 --> 01:18:01.080
But yeah, girl. I seen Kiara, like,
last week, and she was just crazy.

01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:03.616
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:18:03.716 --> 01:18:06.152
- It's good to see you.
- Yeah, it's good to see you too.

01:18:06.252 --> 01:18:08.620
Glad you came. Thank you.

01:18:12.824 --> 01:18:15.795
- Where's the baby?
- Oh, she's at home with John. Yeah.

01:18:15.895 --> 01:18:19.098
- Auntie J, Grandma needs you.
- Give me one second. I'll be back, okay?

01:18:19.198 --> 01:18:22.469
- Hey, LaParis. How you doing?
- Hey, Ms. Abbott.

01:18:22.869 --> 01:18:25.875
- Want to do the quiz?
- Yeah. Yes.

01:18:45.057 --> 01:18:48.364
- Cousins, then who's older?
- I am.

01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:52.254
Okay.

01:18:52.354 --> 01:18:55.250
Everybody, I just want to say something

01:18:55.350 --> 01:19:00.322
because you know Jasmine
and her sister are very special to me,

01:19:00.422 --> 01:19:04.143
and, baby, we are all here for you.

01:19:04.243 --> 01:19:06.071
And I want you to know

01:19:06.171 --> 01:19:11.176
that we are all looking forward
to helping you love that new little baby.

01:19:14.803 --> 01:19:16.772
I got booties.

01:19:20.126 --> 01:19:21.948
This is so cute.

01:19:24.063 --> 01:19:25.462
That's really cute.

01:19:25.562 --> 01:19:27.534
A little wash Muppet, look.

01:19:27.634 --> 01:19:30.039
- Little boy.
- You like it now?

01:19:32.271 --> 01:19:35.341
Thank you. Let's see what's up.

01:19:37.518 --> 01:19:39.315
Formula.

01:19:56.128 --> 01:19:58.534
- Okay. All right. Bye-bye.
- Bye.

01:19:59.331 --> 01:20:02.268
- Hey.
- Hey. How's the baby?

01:20:02.368 --> 01:20:06.542
Oh, she's so good. I really like her.

01:20:08.074 --> 01:20:10.610
How are you feeling?
Are you getting excited?

01:20:10.710 --> 01:20:13.446
Yeah, I'm just ready
to get this baby out of me.

01:20:13.546 --> 01:20:17.584
Oh, well, you're gonna do great.
It seems like you got a lot of help.

01:20:17.684 --> 01:20:19.319
Yeah.

01:20:20.219 --> 01:20:22.255
I signed up for classes at Truman.

01:20:22.355 --> 01:20:25.291
You did? Jasmine, that's amazing.

01:20:25.391 --> 01:20:28.394
Yeah, it's just a city college,
but I think it'll be good.

01:20:28.494 --> 01:20:31.799
- It's close to home, so, you know.
- Wow, I'm...

01:20:32.799 --> 01:20:34.963
I'm so proud of you.

01:20:36.369 --> 01:20:39.772
Look, I'm sorry that I got so
caught up in you going to Illinois.

01:20:39.872 --> 01:20:44.177
It's okay. I should have never poured
that pickle juice into them flaming hots.

01:20:44.277 --> 01:20:47.377
Oh, my gosh. It's so...
it's still so gross.

01:20:47.477 --> 01:20:49.733
Why do you even bring that up?

01:20:50.483 --> 01:20:54.187
Hey, maybe we could go do yoga
and get some milkshakes sometime soon?

01:20:54.287 --> 01:20:58.594
I think that place has baby yoga.
Maybe after the baby comes, we could go.

01:20:58.813 --> 01:21:02.295
- How 'bout we just do milkshakes.
- Yeah. That sounds good.

01:21:02.395 --> 01:21:04.467
Yeah, I like that.

01:21:06.615 --> 01:21:10.136
Okay, now, so tell me. How bad
did it hurt to get that baby out of you?

01:21:10.236 --> 01:21:12.338
Do you want the honest answer
or you want the fake answer?

01:21:12.438 --> 01:21:13.573
Don't lie to me, Ms. Abbott.

01:21:13.673 --> 01:21:16.409
It was the worst pain
I've ever felt in my life.

01:21:16.509 --> 01:21:19.683
- No. Don't tell me that.
- It was pretty bad.
