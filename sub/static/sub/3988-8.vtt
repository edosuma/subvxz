WEBVTT

00:03.629 --> 00:06.336
Governor: I have to talk all of you
into doing something.

00:06.507 --> 00:09.920
Something I know we need to do.

00:12.930 --> 00:15.797
And I don't know how to talk about it.

00:18.519 --> 00:21.261
What do you want us to do?

00:22.315 --> 00:24.681
I want you to survive.

00:26.152 --> 00:28.814
We're not gonna last here.

00:28.988 --> 00:32.105
The biters, there'll be a herd of them.

00:32.283 --> 00:34.990
They'll fill the pits,

00:35.161 --> 00:37.698
they'll crawl over one another.

00:39.498 --> 00:42.490
There'll be enough to tear
right through our camp.

00:44.003 --> 00:46.540
Or it'll be people.

00:46.714 --> 00:49.000
There's nothing between us
and the rest of the world.

00:49.175 --> 00:52.542
Nothing between us and them.

00:55.014 --> 00:57.505
We stay here, we'|| die.

01:07.526 --> 01:09.517
they live in a prison.

01:09.695 --> 01:13.028
|t's north off Highway 34.

01:13.199 --> 01:15.531
They got walls...

01:17.119 --> 01:18.859
...fences,

01:19.038 --> 01:21.745
plots of land for farming.

01:23.042 --> 01:24.703
We could live there.

01:27.922 --> 01:29.207
Uh-uh.

01:30.716 --> 01:33.173
If we're willing to take it from 'em.

01:35.429 --> 01:39.217
l have a plan to do it
without anyone getting hurt.

01:39.392 --> 01:41.383
I captured two of them.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.425
What?

01:43.604 --> 01:47.222
l was scouting the prison and our paths
crossed, so I took 'em.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.857
- You took them?
- They're the key.

01:51.904 --> 01:55.271
They're gonna help us take that prison
without firing a shot.

01:55.449 --> 01:59.067
We can have it
and we don't need to kill anyone.

02:00.746 --> 02:03.408
But...

02:03.582 --> 02:07.825
we need to be prepared to.

02:08.004 --> 02:11.212
(theme music playing )

02:46.334 --> 02:48.996
The people in this prison,
not all of them are bad.

02:49.170 --> 02:52.754
But most of them are thieves,

02:52.923 --> 02:56.006
murderers.

02:56.177 --> 02:58.668
Now why should people like that
have peace of mind

02:58.846 --> 03:02.134
when we're burying our own
just about every day?

03:02.308 --> 03:06.096
These people,
they mutilated me...

03:07.688 --> 03:09.474
...burned my camp...

03:11.317 --> 03:13.524
...killed my daughter.

03:15.654 --> 03:17.940
Now you saw me-- I tried.

03:18.115 --> 03:19.980
I tried to die.

03:20.159 --> 03:22.946
'Cause I didn't want to accept
that you couldn't live in this world

03:23.120 --> 03:24.860
without getting
blood on your hands.

03:25.039 --> 03:27.325
I found you people
and I don't want to die.

03:27.500 --> 03:30.333
I don't want you to die.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.669
They're gonna realize
their people are gone

03:37.843 --> 03:40.380
and they're gonna start getting
ready for whatever's next.

03:40.554 --> 03:43.341
We need to surprise them.
Scare them.

03:43.516 --> 03:46.303
Huh?

03:46.477 --> 03:48.513
And we will win.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.192
I'm in.

03:57.363 --> 04:00.025
- I'm in.
- Man: Me, too.

04:00.199 --> 04:01.484
Pack up and get ready.

04:01.659 --> 04:03.365
We'll go over the plan in half an hour.

04:03.536 --> 04:06.027
- Come on.
- Man: Let's do it.

04:14.046 --> 04:15.707
Where's Megan?

04:15.881 --> 04:18.623
She's reading in the trailer.

04:18.801 --> 04:21.042
You hear all that?

04:21.220 --> 04:23.552
I said we didn't have to fight
for another place.

04:23.722 --> 04:25.883
I know.

04:26.058 --> 04:28.549
Killing people?

04:28.727 --> 04:32.265
No. Killing killers.

04:33.566 --> 04:35.147
You said they weren't all bad people.

04:35.317 --> 04:36.568
Well, they're with bad people.

04:36.735 --> 04:39.226
Am I?

04:43.242 --> 04:45.733
I'm gonna keep you alive.

04:45.911 --> 04:49.199
I'm gonna keep Megan alive.

04:49.373 --> 04:53.582
The only judgment on me I care about
is whether you two are still breathing.

04:55.087 --> 04:57.749
It's good that you heard,

04:57.923 --> 05:00.665
that you know.

05:00.843 --> 05:04.836
Lily... I love you.

05:07.558 --> 05:09.139
I don't know who you are.

05:09.310 --> 05:12.177
Hey, you told me there has to be
someplace better

05:12.354 --> 05:14.310
and that l was gonna
help you find it.

05:15.524 --> 05:17.435
You knew me, Lily.

05:17.610 --> 05:20.477
It was always gonna be like this.

05:23.699 --> 05:26.111
You need to pack up, too.

05:34.084 --> 05:36.211
- Michonne: Don't touch me.
- Governor: Stay still.

05:37.213 --> 05:39.670
( hisses )
Get off me.

05:58.234 --> 06:02.398
You should eat.
It's gonna be a long day.

06:02.571 --> 06:04.482
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

06:07.117 --> 06:08.368
I don't believe that.

06:08.536 --> 06:11.323
Well, I don't care.

06:11.497 --> 06:15.866
Just tell us what this is.
Please.

06:16.043 --> 06:19.786
- It isn't personal.
- Then what is it?

06:22.383 --> 06:24.749
Michonne,
I want you to know...

06:26.136 --> 06:28.218
Penny, my daughter,

06:28.389 --> 06:31.131
she was dead.
I know that now.

06:31.308 --> 06:34.425
Now, I don't want to hurt you.
I don't want to hurt anyone.

06:34.603 --> 06:36.104
I need the prison, that's it.

06:36.272 --> 06:38.058
There are people
I need to keep alive.

06:38.232 --> 06:39.938
You two are gonna help me take it.

06:40.109 --> 06:42.350
No one needs to die.

06:42.528 --> 06:44.564
I'm gonna kill you.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.353
No, you won't.

06:46.532 --> 06:49.114
- I'm gonna take my--
- Stop it.

06:49.285 --> 06:50.741
You want the prison?

06:50.911 --> 06:55.325
Yeah. And I'll take it
as peacefully as I can.

06:55.499 --> 06:57.706
- Governor--
- Don't call me that.

06:59.420 --> 07:02.787
Your people, our people,

07:02.965 --> 07:05.832
we can find a way to live together.

07:06.010 --> 07:09.377
These people you need to keep alive,

07:09.555 --> 07:11.671
do you love them?

07:11.849 --> 07:16.058
You're a good man, Hershel.
A better man than Rick.

07:17.062 --> 07:19.394
Everything you've said,
the way you've said it,

07:19.565 --> 07:22.853
you've changed.
So has Rick.

07:23.027 --> 07:26.736
The two of us will never be able
to live together.

07:26.905 --> 07:29.237
Michonne and l, we'll never be able
to live together.

07:29.408 --> 07:32.366
- We'll find a way.
- I found a way!

07:35.664 --> 07:38.201
I'm trying hard.

07:40.377 --> 07:42.959
There's all kinds of ways
I could do this.

07:44.506 --> 07:47.464
This way, you get to live
and | get to be...

07:55.476 --> 08:00.345
You say you want to take this prison
as peacefully as possible.

08:00.522 --> 08:03.309
That means you'd be willing
to hurt people to get it.

08:03.484 --> 08:05.816
My daughters would be there.

08:05.986 --> 08:09.194
That's who you'd be hurting.

08:11.950 --> 08:15.442
If you understand what it's like
to have a daughter,

08:15.621 --> 08:19.284
then how can you threaten
to kill someone else's?

08:23.420 --> 08:25.672
Because they aren't mine.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.293
( door closes)

08:45.067 --> 08:46.807
Ready?

08:46.985 --> 08:49.476
- Here, take this.
- Okay.

08:49.655 --> 08:52.112
They'll be safe here until we get back.

08:54.326 --> 08:57.159
Biters can't make it across the water.

09:00.124 --> 09:03.457
If it's safe by the water, then let's
just go someplace by the water.

09:03.627 --> 09:05.367
- Lily.
- You don't have to do this.

09:05.546 --> 09:08.504
Anyplace that's safe, really safe,

09:08.674 --> 09:10.630
someone's already there.

09:11.927 --> 09:14.839
Think about Megan, huh?

09:15.013 --> 09:17.425
Lily:
lam.

09:17.599 --> 09:21.057
What's she gonna be in this world?

09:23.272 --> 09:26.184
She's gonna be alive.

09:44.585 --> 09:46.621
Making mud pies?

09:46.795 --> 09:49.628
- Peanut butter sandwiches.
- ( laughs )

10:01.643 --> 10:04.430
How about a hug before I go?

10:04.605 --> 10:06.971
My hands are muddy. See?

10:07.149 --> 10:09.356
Oh, yeah.

10:09.526 --> 10:13.144
Well, I wouldn't want
to get my coat dirty.

10:13.322 --> 10:15.813
( laughs)

10:17.910 --> 10:20.071
I messed it all up.

10:20.245 --> 10:23.578
No, you made it better.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.382
(sighs)

10:43.560 --> 10:46.973
I could use a vacation.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.354
- ( laughs )
- Get away.

10:49.525 --> 10:51.857
Just for a weekend.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.817
Yeah.

10:56.365 --> 10:58.981
You know, our anniversary
is coming up.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.569
It is?

11:00.744 --> 11:02.450
One of these days.

11:02.621 --> 11:05.078
( laughs)

11:07.793 --> 11:09.875
You ever been to Amicalola Falls?

11:10.045 --> 11:12.502
- Tallest waterfall in Georgia.
- Mm-mmm.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.538
My dad took me there
when l was little.

11:14.716 --> 11:17.628
When we were up there,

11:17.803 --> 11:21.216
all the way at the top looking down,

11:21.390 --> 11:22.926
I felt like I was flying.

11:25.394 --> 11:27.555
I'll go load up the station wagon.

11:27.729 --> 11:30.186
( laughs)

11:35.279 --> 11:37.110
I'm gonna get you some water.

11:37.281 --> 11:40.648
- I can get it.
- I know.

11:40.826 --> 11:42.987
But I'm doing it.

11:46.832 --> 11:48.823
I'll be right back.

11:59.344 --> 12:01.255
Man, you couldn't have
waited till we got back?

12:01.430 --> 12:03.421
Until Tyreese got back?

12:03.599 --> 12:05.385
I could've handled that.

12:05.559 --> 12:06.799
Hey. Hey.

12:06.977 --> 12:09.719
She killed two of our own.

12:09.897 --> 12:11.728
She couldn't be here.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.558
She's gonna be all right.

12:15.736 --> 12:18.443
She has a car, supplies, weapons.

12:18.614 --> 12:20.525
She's a survivor.

12:20.699 --> 12:23.190
Stop saying that
like you don't believe it.

12:27.205 --> 12:31.665
She did it.
She said it was for us.

12:31.835 --> 12:33.746
That's how it was in her head.

12:33.921 --> 12:36.628
She wasn't sorry.

12:36.798 --> 12:39.835
Man, that's her, but that ain't her.

12:43.889 --> 12:46.301
What are we supposed to do
about those two girls?

12:48.226 --> 12:51.559
I told her we'd look after them.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.688
I haven't told Tyreese yet.

13:07.245 --> 13:09.110
I don't know how he's gonna take it.

13:15.545 --> 13:17.285
Let's go find out.

13:27.599 --> 13:30.181
( footsteps approaching )

13:34.773 --> 13:37.264
Bob.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.440
You should be resting.

13:42.614 --> 13:44.650
After the night you had, so should you.

13:44.825 --> 13:46.406
I'm going to.

13:46.576 --> 13:48.862
On my way to find
an open cell in C block

13:49.037 --> 13:51.198
until D gets cleaned up.

13:52.457 --> 13:56.917
ljust wanted to say thank you.

13:58.797 --> 14:01.288
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for Hershel

14:01.466 --> 14:03.331
and you.

14:03.510 --> 14:07.423
( sighs )
Hershel, not me.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.508
- You helped save my life.
- Stop.

14:09.683 --> 14:10.923
- Bob.
- Stop.

14:11.101 --> 14:13.217
You put those meds in my lV bag.

14:13.395 --> 14:17.855
And now, in a couple minutes,
I'm gonna feel the sun on my skin.

14:20.277 --> 14:23.565
So you are gonna let me thank you.

14:27.826 --> 14:29.407
( gasps )

14:29.578 --> 14:31.864
Sasha.

14:32.039 --> 14:33.995
You're not strong enough yet.

14:34.166 --> 14:36.873
Then help me.

14:38.837 --> 14:41.453
Tyreese. You down here?

14:41.631 --> 14:43.542
Tyreese:
Rick, that you?

14:50.098 --> 14:52.009
You guys got to see this.

14:52.184 --> 14:54.266
Can we take a beat? There's something
we need to talk about.

14:54.436 --> 14:56.643
It can wait. Come on.

15:04.696 --> 15:06.561
Look.

15:10.494 --> 15:11.950
The hell?

15:12.120 --> 15:15.704
lwasjust looking for...

15:15.874 --> 15:17.455
answers...

15:17.626 --> 15:20.038
and I found this.

15:21.671 --> 15:24.538
Same person that killed
Karen and David did this.

15:24.716 --> 15:26.672
Remember the rats at the fence?

15:26.843 --> 15:28.925
They showed up the same day
she was killed.

15:29.096 --> 15:31.052
We got a psychopath living with us.

15:31.223 --> 15:33.134
- Tyreese.
- We got to find him, Rick.

15:33.308 --> 15:35.424
And I'm not gonna sleep until we do.

15:37.062 --> 15:39.769
Ty reese...

15:39.940 --> 15:42.022
whoever did this,

15:42.192 --> 15:44.353
I don't think that's who killed Karen.

15:45.821 --> 15:47.186
Why?

15:47.364 --> 15:49.730
( explosion )

15:49.908 --> 15:51.364
Come on.

15:56.957 --> 15:59.118
Get back!

16:10.011 --> 16:12.093
Rick!

16:12.264 --> 16:14.505
Come down here.

16:14.683 --> 16:16.799
We need to talk.

16:31.491 --> 16:34.073
It's not up to me.

16:35.704 --> 16:38.912
There's a council now.
They run this place.

16:39.082 --> 16:41.323
ls Hershel on the council?

16:55.849 --> 16:58.511
What about Michonne?

17:00.020 --> 17:02.477
She on the council, too?

17:06.318 --> 17:08.980
I don't make decisions anymore.

17:11.072 --> 17:14.064
You're making the decisions today, Rick.

17:15.410 --> 17:17.742
Come down here.

17:17.913 --> 17:20.154
Let's have that talk.

18:00.455 --> 18:03.913
( faintly )
We can do this. All right?

18:11.675 --> 18:14.041
( squeaks )

18:39.035 --> 18:41.026
We can't take 'em all on.

18:41.204 --> 18:44.321
We'll go through the admin building,
through the woods like we planned.

18:44.499 --> 18:46.911
We ain't got the numbers no more.

18:47.085 --> 18:49.417
When's the last time someone checked
the stash on the bus?

18:49.587 --> 18:51.373
Day before we hit the Big Spot.

18:51.548 --> 18:53.459
We were running low on rations then.
We're lower now.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.248
Yeah, we'll manage.

18:55.427 --> 18:57.793
Things go south,
everyone heads for that bus.

18:57.971 --> 18:58.960
Let everybody know.

18:59.139 --> 19:01.346
What if everybody doesn't know
when things go bad?

19:01.516 --> 19:03.097
How long do we wait?

19:03.268 --> 19:05.554
As long as we can.

19:10.859 --> 19:13.191
Let 'em go right now.

19:14.571 --> 19:16.527
I'll stay down here.

19:16.698 --> 19:19.781
Talk as long as you want.

19:19.951 --> 19:21.816
But you let 'em go.

19:21.995 --> 19:24.657
You got a tank.
You don't need hostages.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.493
I do.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.454
This is just to show you I'm serious.

19:30.628 --> 19:34.291
Not to blast a hole in our new home.

19:36.134 --> 19:38.466
You and your people, you have
till sundown to get out of here

19:38.636 --> 19:41.127
or they die.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.051
Doesn't have to go down this way.

19:44.225 --> 19:47.717
I got more people, more firepower.

19:50.940 --> 19:53.101
We need this prison.

19:56.613 --> 19:59.025
There it is.

20:00.617 --> 20:03.029
It's not about the past.
It's about right now.

20:03.203 --> 20:06.070
There are children here.

20:06.247 --> 20:09.114
Some of them are sick.
They won't survive.

20:14.756 --> 20:16.292
l have a tank.

20:16.466 --> 20:18.923
And I'm letting you walk away from here.

20:20.512 --> 20:22.719
What else is there to talk about?

20:48.957 --> 20:50.447
You good?

20:51.918 --> 20:53.874
Yeah.

21:00.218 --> 21:01.333
( faintly )
All right.

21:58.651 --> 22:01.893
Megan:
Mommy, can you please help me dig?

22:12.123 --> 22:14.500
Mommy, can you please help me?

22:14.667 --> 22:16.328
I'll be right there, honey.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.792
Mommy, it's too heavy.

22:23.593 --> 22:27.051
I hear you. I'll be there in a sec.

22:50.662 --> 22:52.573
Lily:
I'm sorry, honey. What did you say?

22:52.747 --> 22:55.534
It's okay. I can do it myself.

23:33.329 --> 23:35.115
(screaming )

23:35.290 --> 23:37.997
Megan! Megan!

23:38.167 --> 23:40.749
- ( snarling)
- Mommy! Mommy!

23:41.754 --> 23:43.665
(screaming )
Mommy!

23:43.840 --> 23:45.922
Megan!

23:46.092 --> 23:47.548
( crunches )

23:47.719 --> 23:49.926
Megan!

23:56.644 --> 23:59.056
Governor:
I could shoot you all.

23:59.230 --> 24:01.972
You'd all shoot back.
I know that.

24:02.150 --> 24:05.233
But we'll win and you'll be dead.
All of you.

24:07.113 --> 24:11.402
Doesn't have to be like that.
Like I said, it's your choice.

24:12.660 --> 24:15.367
(walkers snarling )

24:23.046 --> 24:25.253
( gunshots)

24:35.224 --> 24:38.011
Noise will only draw
more of them over.

24:38.186 --> 24:41.098
The longer you wait,

24:41.272 --> 24:43.729
the harder it will be
for you to get out of here.

24:49.489 --> 24:51.730
We got to do something.

24:51.908 --> 24:53.899
Your dad's got it.

24:54.077 --> 24:57.160
They're talking.
We could kill the Governor right now.

24:57.330 --> 25:00.538
- From 50 yards?
- I'm a good shot.

25:00.708 --> 25:03.040
I could end this right now.

25:03.211 --> 25:05.827
Yeah, or you could start something else.

25:06.964 --> 25:08.545
You got to trust him.

25:15.056 --> 25:16.262
We're here.

25:16.432 --> 25:18.047
Where are you guys going?

25:18.226 --> 25:20.433
- To the bus. Come on.
- No.

25:20.603 --> 25:23.640
You know the plan.
That's where we're supposed to go.

25:23.815 --> 25:26.932
Carol told us to be strong,
to protect ourselves.

25:27.110 --> 25:30.523
They have guns.
We should have guns, too.

25:30.697 --> 25:32.233
We should help.

25:35.451 --> 25:39.364
You got maybe about an hour
of sunlight left.

25:40.540 --> 25:42.246
| suggest you start packing.

25:56.431 --> 25:58.672
The longer you wait,

25:58.850 --> 26:01.091
the harder it's gonna be
for you to get out of here.

26:05.523 --> 26:07.309
We can all--

26:11.195 --> 26:14.232
we can all live together.

26:16.826 --> 26:19.738
There's enough room for all of us.

26:19.912 --> 26:22.028
More than enough.

26:22.206 --> 26:24.663
But I don't think
my family would sleep well

26:24.834 --> 26:27.541
knowing that you
were under the same roof.

26:27.712 --> 26:30.078
We'd live in different cell blocks.

26:30.256 --> 26:34.420
We'd never have to see each other
till we're all ready.

26:34.594 --> 26:37.586
It could work.

26:37.764 --> 26:39.675
You know it could.

26:40.683 --> 26:42.674
lt could've.

26:42.852 --> 26:45.093
But it can't.

26:46.647 --> 26:48.638
Not after Woodbury.

26:50.151 --> 26:51.641
Not after Andrea.

26:51.819 --> 26:54.526
Look, I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.

26:56.199 --> 26:58.190
Fact is, it's gonna be
a hell of a lot harder

26:58.367 --> 27:02.076
than standing here
shooting at each other.

27:03.581 --> 27:05.367
But I don't think we have a choice.

27:07.418 --> 27:09.955
We don't. You do.

27:10.129 --> 27:12.836
We're not leaving.

27:17.053 --> 27:19.590
You try and force us, we'll fight back.

27:20.723 --> 27:22.714
Like you said,

27:22.892 --> 27:24.678
the gunshots will just
bring more of them out.

27:24.852 --> 27:26.058
They'll take down the fences.

27:26.229 --> 27:29.721
Without the fences,
this place is worthless.

27:30.983 --> 27:34.726
Now, we can all live in the prison

27:34.904 --> 27:36.690
or none of us can.

27:42.662 --> 27:45.074
We'll fix the damn fences.

27:47.667 --> 27:49.874
- No--!
- ( sobbing )

28:01.931 --> 28:04.513
You. You in the ponytails.

28:04.684 --> 28:07.471
Is this what you want?
Is this what any of you want?

28:07.645 --> 28:10.853
What we want is what you got.

28:11.023 --> 28:13.139
Peﬁod.

28:13.317 --> 28:16.184
Time for you to leave, asshole.

28:16.362 --> 28:17.818
Look, I fought him before.

28:17.989 --> 28:21.527
And after, we took in his old friends.

28:21.701 --> 28:24.864
They've become leaders
in what we have here.

28:26.080 --> 28:28.116
Now you put down your weapons,

28:28.291 --> 28:30.156
walk through those gates...

28:31.752 --> 28:33.959
you're one of us.

28:44.015 --> 28:47.633
We let go of all of it,

28:47.810 --> 28:50.017
and nobody dies.

28:53.357 --> 28:55.518
Everyone who's alive right now.

28:57.445 --> 29:00.278
Everyone who's made it this far.

29:00.448 --> 29:04.862
We've all done the worst kinds of things
just to stay alive.

29:06.329 --> 29:08.411
But we can still come back.

29:08.581 --> 29:11.118
We're not too far gone.

29:14.086 --> 29:16.498
We get to come back.

29:16.672 --> 29:18.378
I know...

29:18.549 --> 29:22.667
we all can change.

29:45.284 --> 29:47.275
Liar.

29:55.670 --> 29:57.661
( silent )

30:02.259 --> 30:04.124
No!

30:04.303 --> 30:05.839
Ah!

30:06.013 --> 30:08.470
(gunfire)

30:11.060 --> 30:13.346
- ( screams )
- Daddy!

30:14.730 --> 30:16.812
Ah!

30:34.500 --> 30:36.365
(gasping )

31:04.905 --> 31:07.157
You!

31:07.324 --> 31:10.691
Pick up your weapon!
Fight, now!

31:12.163 --> 31:14.654
(gunfire popping, ringing)

31:25.676 --> 31:27.462
This isn't right.

31:27.636 --> 31:29.092
- We're not supposed to be doing this.
- We are.

31:29.263 --> 31:31.675
He chopped a guy's head off
with a sword.

31:42.943 --> 31:44.524
( hammer clicks)

31:48.616 --> 31:51.483
We have to stay here.
It's too late, you understand me?

31:51.660 --> 31:55.403
Stay behind me and if we get separated,
you just go run somewhere safe and hide.

31:55.581 --> 31:57.663
You hear me?
You go someplace safe and hide

31:57.833 --> 32:00.870
and I will find you when this
is all over. I will find you.

32:01.045 --> 32:02.831
Go through the fence in your cars.

32:03.005 --> 32:05.212
Get your guns, we go in.

32:05.382 --> 32:07.373
Kill them all.

32:07.551 --> 32:10.418
Roger that. Move in!

32:45.172 --> 32:46.958
Go ahead!

32:58.227 --> 32:59.717
I'm out of ammo.

32:59.895 --> 33:01.726
Run for the bus. l'll cover you.

33:06.402 --> 33:08.438
Move up!

33:21.709 --> 33:23.415
Go! Get out of here!

33:37.808 --> 33:40.220
Go, go! Come on!
Glenn's in there. I have to get him.

33:40.394 --> 33:42.635
- I'm going with you.
- Get these people on the bus.

33:42.813 --> 33:44.769
- Be ready to drive. I'll be right back.
- What if you're not?

33:44.940 --> 33:46.601
- You have to go without us.
- I won't go without you.

33:46.775 --> 33:49.027
Beth, get these people
on the bus, okay?

33:49.195 --> 33:51.231
lt's yourjob.
We've all gotjobs to do.

33:56.160 --> 33:58.116
(grunts)

34:07.087 --> 34:09.544
- Glenn!
- What the hell's going on?

34:09.715 --> 34:12.377
We have to get everybody out of here.

34:15.137 --> 34:17.503
(grunts)

34:58.681 --> 35:00.763
Beth! Where's Beth?

35:00.933 --> 35:02.673
- She went to find you.
- Where?

35:02.851 --> 35:04.807
- We'll find her. She'll be okay.
- No.

35:04.979 --> 35:07.015
What? No, you're not going
by yourself.

35:07.189 --> 35:09.305
I'll be right back.

35:10.359 --> 35:12.441
Maggie...

35:12.611 --> 35:13.896
(fist thumps)

35:31.422 --> 35:32.787
(snarling )

35:32.965 --> 35:34.455
Ah!

35:45.602 --> 35:46.728
( snarls )

35:53.068 --> 35:54.808
On your right.

35:59.450 --> 36:00.735
Grenade!

36:09.335 --> 36:12.668
Sasha!Sasha!
Have you seen Beth?

36:12.838 --> 36:14.954
- Is she on the bus?
- No. She's--

36:15.132 --> 36:16.793
Ah!

36:19.011 --> 36:20.672
We gotta stay down.

36:20.846 --> 36:24.009
Look inside my shirt.
Check my back for an exit wound.

36:24.183 --> 36:25.719
Yeah.

36:25.893 --> 36:28.259
That's good.
We can treat it.

36:28.437 --> 36:30.519
- Sasha: Not here.
- Stay down. We'll find someplace safe.

36:34.693 --> 36:36.684
We'll figure it out.
Come on.

37:00.219 --> 37:02.505
- ( gunshot)
- ( groans)

37:06.725 --> 37:08.681
(gunshot)

37:14.858 --> 37:16.974
(snarling )

37:18.445 --> 37:20.106
We got to get out of here.

37:22.157 --> 37:24.773
Hey! We go that way!

37:24.952 --> 37:26.783
(coughing)

37:47.141 --> 37:49.257
(grunts)

37:53.647 --> 37:55.933
(gasping )

37:57.860 --> 38:00.021
(coughing)

38:04.324 --> 38:06.110
Carl...?

38:06.285 --> 38:07.946
Where's Carl?

38:08.120 --> 38:10.076
I don't know.

38:17.337 --> 38:19.999
(Governor moaning )

38:44.573 --> 38:46.484
( grenade rattling )

38:46.658 --> 38:48.865
Grenade!

39:12.351 --> 39:15.138
l was trying to find the kids
to get them on the bus.

39:15.312 --> 39:18.475
We got to go, Beth.
We got to go.

39:23.779 --> 39:25.735
( groans )

39:26.782 --> 39:28.738
Carl!

39:29.743 --> 39:31.574
Carl!

39:33.455 --> 39:35.992
Carl!

39:37.000 --> 39:38.956
Carl?

39:40.546 --> 39:42.787
(snarling )

39:45.133 --> 39:47.465
( gunshots)

40:00.274 --> 40:02.230
Judith.

40:02.401 --> 40:03.811
Where is she?

40:03.986 --> 40:06.602
I don't know.

40:30.345 --> 40:31.960
No.

40:32.139 --> 40:34.846
(sobbing )

40:50.240 --> 40:52.231
Carl. Carl.

40:52.409 --> 40:54.400
(sobbing )

40:55.871 --> 40:57.327
We've got to get out of here.

40:57.497 --> 40:59.203
We've got to go.

40:59.374 --> 41:00.784
Shh. Shh. Shh.

41:00.959 --> 41:04.326
It's over. It's over. It's over.

41:12.304 --> 41:15.467
(snarling )

41:38.538 --> 41:40.244
(gunshot)

42:03.021 --> 42:06.229
Don't look back, Carl.

42:06.400 --> 42:08.937
Just keep walking.
