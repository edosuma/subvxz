WEBVTT

00:05.320 --> 00:07.523
You look beautiful tonight.

00:07.578 --> 00:08.644
Thank you.

00:08.746 --> 00:10.412
Who are you talking to?

00:10.437 --> 00:12.571
My beautiful wife, of course.

00:12.750 --> 00:15.084
Not my beautiful best friend.

00:19.056 --> 00:20.155
David, Joy.

00:20.180 --> 00:21.880
Hey. Hey.

00:22.059 --> 00:24.760
Can you believe your dad is turning 60?

00:24.862 --> 00:26.142
So old!

00:26.167 --> 00:28.831
You know what he means to
do? Start eating soft foods

00:28.856 --> 00:30.198
so he won't have to get
dentures in a minute.

00:30.223 --> 00:31.467
That's not how teeth work, David.

00:31.569 --> 00:33.235
- Huh?
- Okay.

00:33.337 --> 00:35.416
We better go work on our
speeches for your father.

00:35.441 --> 00:37.253
Y'all better bring your A-game.

00:37.278 --> 00:40.146
I've got a little something
special planned for tonight.

00:40.175 --> 00:42.343
You don't have to say that to Sam.

00:42.503 --> 00:43.935
He kills it every year.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.800
Ah, I guess I do, don't I?

00:47.046 --> 00:48.224
All right, see you guys.

00:48.249 --> 00:49.449
Later.

00:49.551 --> 00:51.951
These speeches make me so nervous

00:52.053 --> 00:53.553
'cause you know Dad's
just gonna pick it apart.

00:53.655 --> 00:55.755
Ums and ahs

00:55.857 --> 00:58.291
let the audience know
you're not prepared.

00:58.393 --> 00:59.911
You know what you're gonna say?

00:59.985 --> 01:01.785
Please. I spent the last year crafting

01:01.810 --> 01:05.364
two pages of hilarious
jokes about Dad's mustache.

01:05.779 --> 01:07.685
Damn. That is good.

01:07.747 --> 01:09.754
Hey, happy birthday, Lawrence!

01:09.779 --> 01:12.138
Oh, hey, Mom. Hi, Daddy.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.340
My darling.

01:15.710 --> 01:17.020
Son.

01:24.819 --> 01:27.409
Dad, you...

01:28.289 --> 01:29.889
you shaved your mustache.

01:29.991 --> 01:32.825
Yes, son. One should
never stop evolving.

01:32.927 --> 01:35.995
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to welcome my guests.

01:37.999 --> 01:39.676
Look at you two all dressed up.

01:39.701 --> 01:41.211
- Mommy.
- Come here, sweetie.

01:41.236 --> 01:42.402
Hey, Mommy.

01:43.571 --> 01:45.738
And Tim, look at you.

01:45.840 --> 01:47.006
Give me a twirl.

01:50.024 --> 01:53.079
Come on! I love it!

01:53.181 --> 01:56.416
Greetings. Greetings, all of you.

01:56.518 --> 02:00.781
My perfect wife and I
would like to welcome you

02:00.908 --> 02:03.709
to the celebration of my 60th birthday.

02:04.482 --> 02:06.482
Now, my family teases me

02:06.585 --> 02:09.520
about being too critical of the speeches

02:09.692 --> 02:11.165
that people make at events like these.

02:12.667 --> 02:15.753
But I think they're exaggerating.

02:16.438 --> 02:18.371
But now, if you're gonna make a speech,

02:18.473 --> 02:21.307
pretend that there's a little, tiny baby

02:21.409 --> 02:25.011
seated way in the back facing the wall.

02:25.113 --> 02:28.247
That baby needs to hear
your speech as well.

02:28.349 --> 02:30.550
All right. Enough with the formalities.

02:31.793 --> 02:34.822
I think we all know what time it is.

02:38.293 --> 02:40.326
Let's hustle!

02:44.466 --> 02:46.466
Are y'all ready?

02:47.554 --> 02:48.654
Let's do it!

02:50.004 --> 02:51.170
Hey!

02:54.275 --> 02:55.736
Whoo!

02:55.761 --> 02:56.688
- So let's go.
- Later!

02:59.314 --> 03:01.784
Hey! Ho!

03:02.283 --> 03:03.516
Whoo!

03:03.618 --> 03:05.251
Uh-huh! Whoo!

03:07.000 --> 03:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:17.465 --> 03:19.031
I'll never forget the day Mr. Duvet

03:19.133 --> 03:22.869
looked at me and said,
"Son, you must have

03:22.971 --> 03:26.572
a great plan to be a great man."

03:26.994 --> 03:29.308
Happy birthday, Mr. Duvet.

03:32.847 --> 03:34.881
That was very good. Thank you, Thomas.

03:34.983 --> 03:37.950
Remember to enunciate.

03:40.781 --> 03:43.556
Sam, these mustache jokes are great.

03:43.658 --> 03:45.925
Well, solid gold, baby.

03:46.027 --> 03:48.603
But they're useless now.
Don't worry about me.

03:48.705 --> 03:50.506
My speech gonna be just fine, okay?

03:50.531 --> 03:53.374
Sam, take it easy on us this year.

03:53.476 --> 03:54.609
Oh, you know I won't.

03:54.634 --> 03:55.865
Yeah, this guy.

03:55.890 --> 03:57.645
All right now.

04:00.350 --> 04:01.616
What the...

04:04.354 --> 04:06.220
There are clowns here?

04:06.573 --> 04:09.141
That's just Mr. Bones. He's
good friends with my dad.

04:09.166 --> 04:10.912
I've never met a clown before.

04:12.387 --> 04:14.053
You think you could introduce me?

04:14.078 --> 04:17.031
Tim, does a circus
bear shit on a toilet?

04:17.132 --> 04:18.099
I don't know.

04:22.305 --> 04:23.237
Hey, Mr. Bones.

04:23.339 --> 04:24.906
Oh, hi, Sam.

04:25.008 --> 04:27.608
- He knows your name?
- Yeah.

04:27.710 --> 04:29.710
Uh, Mr. Bones, I want you
to meet my best friend, Tim.

04:29.735 --> 04:30.688
Hey.

04:31.748 --> 04:35.082
I'm a little scared.

04:35.184 --> 04:36.117
Is it gonna hurt?

04:40.390 --> 04:42.290
Uh, where's your joy buzzer?

04:42.392 --> 04:44.158
I'm not working tonight.

04:44.827 --> 04:47.828
Uh, you're in costume.

04:47.931 --> 04:51.299
I just left a job and I have
another job right after this.

04:51.401 --> 04:52.644
Well, if you could just do

04:52.669 --> 04:55.375
a little something for me, Mr. Bones.

04:55.400 --> 04:57.838
I'm not Mr. Bones right now.

04:58.221 --> 05:01.447
My name is Julian and I'm at
my friend's birthday party.

05:01.728 --> 05:03.354
Please, respect my privacy.

05:06.716 --> 05:08.861
Talking about one gag.

05:09.519 --> 05:12.653
Young man, asking me to perform here

05:12.755 --> 05:17.680
is like asking a mailman to
go for a walk on his day off.

05:20.990 --> 05:24.377
Wait. Was that the joke?

05:24.901 --> 05:27.476
I guess it's kind of funny.

05:28.671 --> 05:31.138
I bet you drive a funny little car.

05:31.240 --> 05:33.590
I drive a 2013 Malibu.

05:33.615 --> 05:34.953
Oh, what the...

05:34.978 --> 05:37.278
You know, I'm not gonna get every joke.

05:37.380 --> 05:41.482
And when... when I got
down to that hospital,

05:41.584 --> 05:46.821
they told me the bill had
already been paid by Mr. Duvet.

05:48.725 --> 05:50.992
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

05:51.094 --> 05:53.060
Uh, thank you very much, Joy.

05:53.162 --> 05:56.597
You see, this is why microphone
placement is so important.

05:56.699 --> 05:58.432
When it's just perfect,

05:58.534 --> 06:01.102
you can hear you even
through your tears.

06:01.204 --> 06:04.824
Thank you, Joy.

06:06.175 --> 06:07.875
Molly, what are you doing here?

06:07.977 --> 06:10.911
Well, officially, I'm
checking out a B&E on Linwood,

06:11.014 --> 06:13.781
but unofficially,
your parents invited me

06:13.883 --> 06:15.750
and they sat us next to each other.

06:15.852 --> 06:17.652
Looks like they wish
we were back together.

06:17.754 --> 06:19.153
Well, they definitely wish

06:19.255 --> 06:20.221
we were back together.

06:23.559 --> 06:25.159
Sam, what's wrong?

06:25.261 --> 06:26.460
Hmm? Nothing.

06:26.562 --> 06:28.663
You're fiddling with your balls.

06:28.765 --> 06:31.499
You do that when you're upset.
Now, who did this to you?

06:31.601 --> 06:34.718
You know I can have anyone thrown
in jail whenever I feel like it.

06:34.742 --> 06:35.889
I don't even need a reason.

06:35.890 --> 06:37.281
Oh, don't say stuff like that.

06:37.306 --> 06:40.074
There was this one guy,
innocent as a newborn baby.

06:40.176 --> 06:41.876
I cuffed and stuffed
him in the back of my car

06:41.978 --> 06:44.979
just to see what would happen
and I was not disappointed.

06:45.081 --> 06:46.464
- Stop. Stop... stop it.
- He pissed himself.

06:46.489 --> 06:48.215
Stop talking.

06:48.646 --> 06:51.271
No one did anything to me. It's just...

06:52.255 --> 06:53.921
I don't have anything
for my dad's speech.

06:54.023 --> 06:55.935
But you crush it every year.

06:55.988 --> 06:58.995
Oh, I know. You don't have to tell me.

06:59.796 --> 07:02.433
Sam, you're fiddling with
your balls. What's wrong?

07:02.523 --> 07:03.931
He's nervous about his speech.

07:04.033 --> 07:05.286
Oh, hey, Molly. Oink, oink.

07:05.311 --> 07:07.478
I thought I smelled
bacon. I thought this was

07:07.503 --> 07:09.234
a birthday party, not a pig roast.

07:09.259 --> 07:10.930
Ah, it's so good to see you two.

07:10.955 --> 07:12.373
- Yeah, you too.
- Where's your box of donuts?

07:12.475 --> 07:15.209
Careful or I'll bust you for
that crack in your pocket.

07:15.311 --> 07:16.811
What crack in my pock...

07:16.913 --> 07:19.513
How in the hell did you do that?

07:19.615 --> 07:22.086
How did you do that?

07:22.111 --> 07:24.011
Okay, I've got something.

07:24.036 --> 07:25.720
It's a bit of a Hail Mary...

07:25.822 --> 07:27.655
The ace up my sleeve, if you will.

07:27.757 --> 07:29.757
I'm going next. Wish me luck.

07:38.301 --> 07:41.085
Shit!

07:41.110 --> 07:42.536
You were gonna sing
"You Are My Sunshine"?

07:42.623 --> 07:44.559
Our dad does love that song.

07:49.979 --> 07:53.114
That was wonderful. Thank you so much.

07:53.216 --> 07:55.449
Now, some of you may remember that song

07:55.551 --> 07:58.207
from the Coen Brothers' movie,

07:58.293 --> 07:59.723
"O Brother Where Art Thou?"

07:59.769 --> 08:01.956
based on Homer's "Odyssey".

08:02.058 --> 08:05.300
Now, if I may quote the great Homer,

08:06.158 --> 08:07.190
Let's hustle!

08:29.363 --> 08:32.330
Oh, boy, clown at a buffet.

08:32.440 --> 08:33.706
Here we go.

08:33.808 --> 08:35.041
What?

08:35.066 --> 08:36.985
I mean, that is kind of a lot of rice.

08:37.890 --> 08:39.222
Is that a joke?

08:39.481 --> 08:40.647
I'm just hungry.

08:50.258 --> 08:51.824
You're not gonna get pie?

08:51.927 --> 08:53.365
That's the funniest food here!

08:53.390 --> 08:55.461
There's nothing funny about these pies.

08:55.564 --> 08:56.963
I worked hard on them.

08:57.065 --> 08:58.431
Oh, well, I'm sorry,

08:58.456 --> 08:59.866
because by the end of the night,

08:59.968 --> 09:02.302
these pies are gonna be
flying around the room.

09:03.505 --> 09:05.171
You wasted your time, ma'am.

09:05.196 --> 09:07.106
Hey, back off my wife, man.

09:07.131 --> 09:09.350
Hey, back off my husband, man.

09:09.844 --> 09:12.011
I'm just saying, there
is a clown in the room.

09:12.113 --> 09:13.179
These pies are toast.

09:13.281 --> 09:14.514
Shh.

09:14.616 --> 09:16.282
You see how big he is
and how small you are?

09:16.384 --> 09:17.850
- Come on.
- Ho ho ho!

09:17.953 --> 09:19.953
Mr. Bones is gonna [bleep] these up.

09:20.055 --> 09:21.620
Oh.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.826
Ha!

09:34.933 --> 09:36.900
Ha ha ha ha ha!

09:37.669 --> 09:39.401
I love you Uncle Lawrence.

09:45.677 --> 09:47.859
David, you have a degree in economics.

09:51.116 --> 09:52.549
Good job, baby.

09:52.651 --> 09:55.160
I know, right? Beat that, Sam.

09:55.185 --> 09:57.621
David, you have no
external sense of self.

09:57.723 --> 10:00.437
You know what you need to
do? Take off your shirt.

10:00.462 --> 10:01.769
Paste some eyes on your nipples

10:01.794 --> 10:03.393
and a mouth on your belly button.

10:03.495 --> 10:04.802
Then take a giant top hat and put it

10:04.827 --> 10:06.912
over your head and shoulders.

10:06.937 --> 10:08.265
People love that.

10:08.367 --> 10:09.599
That's a terrible idea.

10:09.701 --> 10:11.835
Never mind. Don't do it.

10:11.937 --> 10:12.999
Why not?

10:13.023 --> 10:14.690
That guy's doing it right now.

10:20.164 --> 10:21.363
He likes that?

10:29.610 --> 10:30.576
Hey, bud.

10:31.513 --> 10:33.280
Your song was super cute.

10:33.305 --> 10:36.209
Yeah, I know I was cute.
That's what I was going for.

10:37.952 --> 10:39.819
Well, I was just trying to be nice.

10:39.844 --> 10:41.185
- You want to be nice?
- Yeah.

10:41.672 --> 10:43.622
Why don't you go get me a few drinks?

10:43.725 --> 10:45.958
That bitch waitress won't get me a beer.

10:46.060 --> 10:47.507
It's probably 'cause you're seven.

10:47.532 --> 10:49.702
Okay, sunburn. We're done here.

10:49.797 --> 10:51.831
Oh.

10:53.401 --> 10:54.667
You cover your ears.

10:55.802 --> 10:57.058
Cover your ears.

10:57.739 --> 10:58.704
You know what?

10:59.663 --> 11:02.374
Santa Claus isn't real.

11:02.399 --> 11:03.378
Oh yeah?

11:03.978 --> 11:06.078
Then who gave me this huge hog?

11:09.917 --> 11:12.852
He asked Santa for a huge hog.

11:15.117 --> 11:16.558
And he gave it to him.

11:26.310 --> 11:27.310
Look at you.

11:28.379 --> 11:30.715
He's more than just a father,

11:31.606 --> 11:32.783
he's a friend.

11:33.450 --> 11:34.816
I love you, Dad.

11:36.642 --> 11:39.415
To the best father...

11:39.557 --> 11:42.727
in the whole wide world.

11:46.579 --> 11:48.245
Well done. Well done.

11:51.396 --> 11:53.805
Uh, uh, do you mind if
I say a few words here?

11:54.532 --> 11:57.667
Does everybody remember when
Mr. Duvet had a mustache?

11:57.692 --> 11:59.191
Yeah, of course we remember!

11:59.215 --> 12:00.673
It's fresh in our mind.

12:00.698 --> 12:02.138
I can hear It's a
couple minutes of that.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.440
Great, because, um, I'm not saying

12:04.542 --> 12:06.843
Mr. Duvet's mustache was big,

12:06.945 --> 12:08.811
but if you turned him upside down,

12:08.913 --> 12:10.313
he could be a push broom.

12:11.916 --> 12:14.150
And it even looked
like a push broom too,

12:14.252 --> 12:16.252
'cause it always had food in it.

12:18.122 --> 12:21.424
I mean, I've heard of a
salt and pepper mustache,

12:21.526 --> 12:23.292
but Mr. Duvet's mustache

12:23.394 --> 12:26.963
was salt and pepper
and pickles and onions.

12:29.434 --> 12:31.934
I-I mean, you would see
corn in his mustache,

12:32.036 --> 12:34.737
be like, "Wait a minute, we
haven't had corn in weeks".

12:35.907 --> 12:38.007
Look at that picture up there.

12:38.109 --> 12:40.743
Is that Mr. Duvet or did Cousin Itt

12:40.845 --> 12:43.279
shave everything but his mustache?

12:44.605 --> 12:46.496
You are gonna make me throw up.

12:46.972 --> 12:48.684
Mr. Duvet doesn't have

12:48.786 --> 12:50.086
the greatest mustache in the world.

12:50.188 --> 12:53.890
He has the second-greatest
only to Aunt Lacey!

13:17.181 --> 13:19.849
Tim! Tim! Tim! Tim! Tim! Tim!

13:22.120 --> 13:23.152
Tim! Tim! Tim! Tim! Tim! Tim!

13:24.856 --> 13:27.497
That's my husband! That's my husband!

13:29.694 --> 13:32.561
Tim! Tim! Tim! Tim! Tim! Tim!

13:35.928 --> 13:39.436
Oh! Now, ladies and gentlemen,

13:39.537 --> 13:44.663
I would hate to have anybody try
to follow that amazing speech.

13:45.096 --> 13:46.462
Therefore...

13:46.487 --> 13:48.020
- Let's hustle!
- Whoo!

13:57.922 --> 13:59.453
I can't believe you used all my jokes.

13:59.680 --> 14:01.390
You threw 'em out.

14:01.492 --> 14:03.125
That's before I knew
they were gonna kill.

14:03.227 --> 14:05.649
Hey, you talkin' or
you doin' The Hustle?

14:05.703 --> 14:06.896
You can't do both.

14:06.998 --> 14:08.230
Sorry, Grandma.

14:08.255 --> 14:09.487
I honestly have trouble doing both.

14:14.344 --> 14:16.441
You were great up there.

14:16.559 --> 14:17.625
I couldn't take my eyes off you.

14:17.727 --> 14:19.445
Do you act?

14:19.470 --> 14:20.391
No.

14:20.416 --> 14:21.485
You should.

14:22.212 --> 14:23.378
You got the body for it.

14:23.480 --> 14:26.748
You are a little gentleman.

14:26.773 --> 14:28.066
What are you...

14:28.652 --> 14:30.251
Hey, pal, why don't you take

14:30.276 --> 14:31.481
your little huge hog out of here?

14:32.324 --> 14:34.401
- Jesus.
- Tim, he's a kid.

14:34.425 --> 14:35.629
He's got the shit out of me.

14:36.782 --> 14:38.080
Uh, Samuel.

14:38.862 --> 14:41.813
Let me talk to you. What is wrong?

14:42.599 --> 14:44.065
I'm worried about my speech for Dad.

14:44.167 --> 14:45.485
Oh, don't be.

14:45.501 --> 14:49.236
You may not be funny like Tim
or thoughtful like your sister,

14:49.338 --> 14:52.516
but you are the cutest

14:52.541 --> 14:55.171
little ladybug there ever was.

14:55.196 --> 14:56.287
Hmm?

14:56.312 --> 14:57.522
Mom, have you been drinking wine?

14:57.547 --> 14:58.913
Oh, please.

14:59.348 --> 15:02.000
Oh, look, there's Molly.

15:02.025 --> 15:04.075
God, I love that girl.

15:04.153 --> 15:06.654
Mr. Duvet, my favorite piece of advice

15:06.756 --> 15:08.119
you ever gave me was

15:08.144 --> 15:10.869
to alwaysremain excited for the future.

15:10.924 --> 15:13.628
<i>All units, I've been
hit! I need backup...</i>

15:15.313 --> 15:18.465
Tonight, as we celebrate
all that you have been,

15:18.568 --> 15:22.236
remember, we also celebrate
all that you will be.

15:23.311 --> 15:25.084
Happy birthday, Mr. Duvet.

15:30.960 --> 15:34.407
Now, that was a nice speech.

15:34.913 --> 15:38.136
Somebody ought to ask her to marry him!

15:38.788 --> 15:41.422
Son, I'm referring to you.

15:41.524 --> 15:44.457
Mom, I know. Oh, my God.

15:44.994 --> 15:46.894
Oh, no.

15:46.996 --> 15:48.562
You're gonna do a spit take, right?

15:50.833 --> 15:52.499
No spit take?

15:52.602 --> 15:54.759
What kind of clown are you, man?

15:54.784 --> 15:56.203
Look around, kid.

15:56.305 --> 15:58.639
The only clown in this room is you.

16:18.809 --> 16:21.455
Sam, am I a clown?

16:22.298 --> 16:24.552
Tim, I'm really freaking out right now.

16:24.577 --> 16:26.210
I mean, I've got nothing.

16:26.235 --> 16:27.401
What am I gonna do?

16:27.503 --> 16:29.136
Why are you stressed out about this?

16:29.238 --> 16:30.437
You're always so good
at things like this.

16:30.539 --> 16:32.106
I mean, Tim, I could get up there

16:32.208 --> 16:34.808
and I could tell jokes and sing a song

16:34.910 --> 16:37.203
and get hands clapping
and panties dropping.

16:37.228 --> 16:38.238
This is a family event.

16:38.263 --> 16:39.781
That's not what I what I want,

16:39.806 --> 16:41.183
you know? Not tonight.

16:41.450 --> 16:45.286
I just want to let my dad
know how I feel about him.

16:45.388 --> 16:48.522
You know, let him know
that as I grow older,

16:48.624 --> 16:50.924
I see myself becoming
more and more like him,

16:51.027 --> 16:53.927
and it just lets me know that
I'm headed on the right path.

16:57.133 --> 16:59.433
Samuel, that was perfect.

16:59.535 --> 17:00.801
You projected wonderfully.

17:00.903 --> 17:03.202
I could hear you all the way
in the back of the bathroom.

17:05.040 --> 17:06.740
Thanks, Dad.

17:06.842 --> 17:08.131
Hey, guys.

17:09.645 --> 17:11.979
Oh, man, who stunk it up in here?

17:12.080 --> 17:14.238
Well, I had an opportuni...

17:14.262 --> 17:15.301
I did.

17:16.560 --> 17:17.969
I stunk it up in here.

17:19.377 --> 17:20.566
With a poo.

17:21.457 --> 17:24.058
Guys, check this out. It stinks.

17:24.160 --> 17:27.661
- Well...
- Ooh, whoa! Whoa!

17:27.762 --> 17:30.279
- Uh, yeah, that's my poop.
- Hoo!

17:30.498 --> 17:31.900
There's still poop in here.

17:32.001 --> 17:33.167
Why didn't you flush?

17:33.192 --> 17:35.659
He did flush. He flushed five times,

17:35.838 --> 17:38.891
but there was so much poop
that it got stuck in the pipe.

17:38.999 --> 17:40.763
It's all according to Sam.

17:40.788 --> 17:42.778
Yeah, that's what happened.

17:43.752 --> 17:47.173
Yeah. And I pooped too.

17:47.735 --> 17:50.109
You're also smelling my crap.

17:50.134 --> 17:52.912
- Yeah.
- Hey, guys.

18:12.662 --> 18:13.828
And I do, Dad.

18:29.378 --> 18:30.644
♪ My sun...

18:42.883 --> 18:44.383
It's fine. Hard to go second,

18:44.408 --> 18:46.008
so, had the idea first.

18:49.161 --> 18:50.250
Better than the kid.

18:50.275 --> 18:52.380
Okay, now, if there
are no more speeches...

18:53.558 --> 18:54.523
Julian.

18:55.259 --> 18:57.159
Did you want to say something?

18:57.261 --> 18:58.661
All right.

18:58.686 --> 19:02.101
Oh, boy. Here comes Mr. Bones.

19:02.125 --> 19:03.705
Watch this, folks.

19:03.730 --> 19:05.497
He is not performing tonight.

19:05.567 --> 19:08.848
- Shh.
- Andrew Carnegie once said,

19:10.340 --> 19:12.606
"As I grow older,

19:12.709 --> 19:15.573
"I pay less attention to what men say.

19:16.846 --> 19:18.746
I just watch what they do".

19:22.719 --> 19:23.800
Shit.

19:24.754 --> 19:26.205
Classic!

19:26.489 --> 19:28.756
He slow-played me, baby!

19:28.858 --> 19:30.825
No, I don't know, Tim.
I think he's really hurt.

19:30.927 --> 19:33.702
Oh, no, no, that was a clown fall.

19:36.787 --> 19:37.865
Oh.

19:37.967 --> 19:41.769
You brilliant master
of the comedic arts.

19:59.222 --> 20:00.421
Yes!

20:00.523 --> 20:03.224
In your face, pie lady!

20:04.360 --> 20:06.160
Oh!

20:13.436 --> 20:14.969
I should kick your ass.

20:15.071 --> 20:17.115
Come on. Come on. Come on. Just sit.

20:17.140 --> 20:18.979
Just... come on.

20:19.004 --> 20:22.309
Just sit. Just sit. Just...

20:28.545 --> 20:30.545
Everybody has a birthday.

20:31.740 --> 20:34.107
Men, wome, boys and girls,

20:34.489 --> 20:37.151
It's a time to reflect on your life.

20:39.292 --> 20:42.591
The past and future happenings.

20:42.615 --> 20:45.154
I am very happy

20:45.654 --> 20:49.326
because today is my birthday.

20:50.115 --> 20:51.693
Let's hustle!
