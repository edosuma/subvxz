WEBVTT

00:08.843 --> 00:11.554
and I've been wrong...

00:11.554 --> 00:13.264
[Camille] Across all cultures,

00:13.264 --> 00:15.599
the trope of the beautiful
white princess

00:15.599 --> 00:18.394
living happily ever after
has been taught to girls

00:18.394 --> 00:20.229
to entertain them as children,

00:20.229 --> 00:23.315
while ultimately
disappointing them as adults.

00:23.315 --> 00:26.819
If the end of the fairy tale
is the man claiming the woman,

00:26.819 --> 00:28.154
well, then it stands to reason

00:28.154 --> 00:30.030
how underwhelming
and confusing

00:30.030 --> 00:32.450
modern dating
and relationships are.

00:32.450 --> 00:35.411
Women are taught to just
wait for the man to find you,

00:35.411 --> 00:38.456
and then this beginning
is actually your happy ending.

00:38.456 --> 00:41.459
But now princesses don't
even want to be princesses

00:41.459 --> 00:43.919
so instead, they pull
long hours at work

00:43.919 --> 00:46.297
in the hopes of landing
their dream jobs.

00:46.297 --> 00:48.632
Then one day,
those little girls grow up

00:48.632 --> 00:51.302
and realize the fairy-tale
life they dreamt of

00:51.302 --> 00:52.928
isn't actually guaranteed.

00:52.928 --> 00:54.972
[Dr. Pruitt] Everyone, please
gather in the living room

00:54.972 --> 00:57.641
so I can introduce
our newest faculty member.

00:57.641 --> 01:00.728
But before we get
into our business,

01:00.728 --> 01:02.396
I just want to say,

01:02.396 --> 01:06.442
Melba, the food this evening
was unbelievable.

01:06.442 --> 01:08.402
[applause]

01:08.402 --> 01:12.072
We really took a lot of time
to find this professor,

01:12.072 --> 01:13.824
and we really did

01:13.824 --> 01:15.576
search high and low

01:15.576 --> 01:16.911
until we finally found him.

01:16.911 --> 01:18.162
Of course.

01:18.162 --> 01:21.624
And I'd like to introduce you

01:21.624 --> 01:23.417
to Dr. Obinna...

01:23.417 --> 01:25.252
- Tseggai.
- Tseggai.

01:25.252 --> 01:26.754
[Obinna] Yes.
[Dr. Pruitt] Yes!

01:26.754 --> 01:28.339
[applause]

01:28.339 --> 01:29.715
Just to give you
a little background,

01:29.715 --> 01:31.175
I wrote it all out.

01:31.175 --> 01:32.843
Uh, he brings with him

01:32.843 --> 01:36.263
a host of experience
with accolades.

01:36.263 --> 01:37.890
He's a Rhodes scholar.

01:37.890 --> 01:40.601
He has a PhD from Northwestern,

01:40.601 --> 01:42.228
and most recently he was

01:42.228 --> 01:46.899
the chair of the anthropology
department at Sarah Lawrence.

01:46.899 --> 01:49.527
And he's also
a longtime contributor...

01:49.527 --> 01:51.070
[Camille] That's it.

01:51.070 --> 01:52.321
It's over.

01:52.321 --> 01:54.240
Officially, Dr. Pruitt
hired someone

01:54.240 --> 01:55.866
for the associate position.

01:55.866 --> 01:58.536
Damn, Cam.

01:58.536 --> 01:59.787
But you know what?

01:59.787 --> 02:02.456
The worst part is, he's Black.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.874
Like, Nigerian Black.

02:03.874 --> 02:05.334
Like, speaks
13 different languages,

02:05.334 --> 02:06.418
has, like, 17 degrees.

02:06.418 --> 02:08.045
I mean, he's pretty much
fucking perfect.

02:08.045 --> 02:10.673
I'm trying to follow.
How is that the worst part?

02:10.673 --> 02:14.844
No, no, no, of course
I'm happy for Obinna

02:14.844 --> 02:16.262
and that a person of color
got the job.

02:16.262 --> 02:18.222
Yay, team.

02:18.222 --> 02:19.890
It's just...

02:19.890 --> 02:21.475
if I'm being completely honest,

02:21.475 --> 02:24.395
it would have been easier
if Dr. Pruitt had just

02:24.395 --> 02:26.230
hired a regular white dude.

02:26.230 --> 02:27.940
Then I could chalk up
the rejection

02:27.940 --> 02:29.400
to racism or sexism

02:29.400 --> 02:32.194
or any -ism would be
better than the truth.

02:32.194 --> 02:37.116
Which is...

02:37.116 --> 02:39.285
I'm just not good enough.

02:39.285 --> 02:41.996
I had this whole plan,
this whole dream,

02:41.996 --> 02:44.790
and I'm not even good enough
to make it happen.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.917
No, no, no.
Fuck...fuck them.

02:46.917 --> 02:48.586
And fuck Pruitt.

02:48.586 --> 02:50.045
Good...good for the brother.

02:50.045 --> 02:52.172
But fuck...fuck the rest
of the department, all right?

02:52.172 --> 02:55.134
You don't need them.
They need you, okay?

03:03.017 --> 03:04.602
You know,

03:04.602 --> 03:08.147
you could come with me
to University of Chicago.

03:08.147 --> 03:09.440
I don't think that's...

03:09.440 --> 03:11.358
I mean, I start
my residency in a few weeks,

03:11.358 --> 03:12.818
which would give you
enough time

03:12.818 --> 03:13.861
to finish out the semester.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.237
I could call Dr. Elam.

03:15.237 --> 03:16.947
I mean, they would
kill to have you

03:16.947 --> 03:18.449
for a semester or two.

03:18.449 --> 03:19.909
Let me...you know what?
Let me call Dr. Elam right now.

03:19.909 --> 03:22.077
Okay, Jameson, stop.

03:22.077 --> 03:24.580
I sort of have
a history with boyfriends

03:24.580 --> 03:27.958
wanting me to leave
New York with them, and...

03:27.958 --> 03:29.627
it just doesn't go well.

03:29.627 --> 03:32.421
Cam, that was then.

03:32.421 --> 03:35.174
Plus, we would have
a kick-ass time in Chicago.

03:35.174 --> 03:37.676
But we would have
a kick ass time anywhere.

03:37.676 --> 03:40.054
Facts.

03:40.054 --> 03:41.388
Look, wherever you want to be,

03:41.388 --> 03:42.973
if we end up
going long distance,

03:42.973 --> 03:45.809
I just need a firm
Skype sex commitment,

03:45.809 --> 03:48.020
and we good.

03:48.020 --> 03:49.063
You got it.

03:49.063 --> 03:50.397
[]

03:53.400 --> 03:55.235
All right, I'm gonna
run to the bedroom

03:55.235 --> 03:58.447
to start up
this Skype sex thing.

03:58.447 --> 04:00.449
- Right now, right now?
- Right now.

04:03.369 --> 04:05.579
I don't think
I owe Brandon shit.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.873
I mean, it's not like
I'm some basketball player

04:07.873 --> 04:09.875
who cheated on his
high school sweetheart

04:09.875 --> 04:12.169
and mother of three
of four of his kids

04:12.169 --> 04:14.797
with some white girl
who was way too young

04:14.797 --> 04:15.965
and knocked her up too.

04:15.965 --> 04:17.341
That's oddly specific.

04:17.341 --> 04:19.510
I just think that Brandon
should just sign the papers

04:19.510 --> 04:21.095
and move the fuck on.

04:21.095 --> 04:22.096
[June] The question is,
how much

04:22.096 --> 04:23.180
will he be taking

04:23.180 --> 04:24.515
when he moves the fuck on?

04:24.515 --> 04:26.183
This is why I always
stress the importance

04:26.183 --> 04:29.937
of having the proper
paperwork in place.

04:29.937 --> 04:32.106
Very helpful.

04:33.065 --> 04:34.400
How much is this gon' cost me?

04:34.400 --> 04:36.735
When you've been married
ten years, the math changes.

04:36.735 --> 04:38.445
Oh, that sounds like
lawyer for "a lot."

04:38.445 --> 04:40.114
[June] You'll be lucky
if it's just a lot.

04:40.114 --> 04:42.908
It's probably closer
to a lot, a lot.

04:42.908 --> 04:45.869
You started the business
when you were married.

04:45.869 --> 04:48.539
So Brandon is
technically entitled

04:48.539 --> 04:50.416
to profits from the business

04:50.416 --> 04:51.834
for the rest of his life,

04:51.834 --> 04:54.586
or at least
the life of the business.

04:54.586 --> 04:56.463
I just can't believe

04:56.463 --> 05:00.676
that I created
one of the only tech companies

05:00.676 --> 05:02.845
run by a queer woman of color

05:02.845 --> 05:04.596
just to have it
taken by some man.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.223
And I've been with you
since the beginning.

05:06.223 --> 05:08.976
So trust me,
it's killing me too.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.270
Look, we can go to court
and try to fight it,

05:11.270 --> 05:13.439
but you're likely
on the losing side,

05:13.439 --> 05:16.358
and a trial would just
eat up even more money.

05:16.358 --> 05:19.236
Your best bet is a lump of cash

05:19.236 --> 05:21.864
to make him go away.

05:21.864 --> 05:23.741
[upbeat music]

05:23.741 --> 05:25.993
Like a hitman?

05:25.993 --> 05:27.494
I know that's not
what you mean,

05:27.494 --> 05:29.371
but it makes me feel good
to think about it.

05:29.371 --> 05:33.751
[both breathing heavily]

05:33.751 --> 05:35.836
That was incredible.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.504
Ah, the best.

05:37.504 --> 05:40.257
I met a soul mate
and in a show?

05:40.257 --> 05:41.800
How lucky am I?

05:41.800 --> 05:45.971
So...you like being in this?

05:45.971 --> 05:47.389
It puts food on the table,

05:47.389 --> 05:48.682
keeps my health
insurance going,

05:48.682 --> 05:50.225
and I get to perform.

05:50.225 --> 05:52.269
And that's enough for you?

05:52.269 --> 05:53.771
Of course I dream of more,

05:53.771 --> 05:56.106
but I also know how lucky I am.

05:56.106 --> 05:58.275
I'm not stuck at some day job.

05:58.275 --> 06:00.319
I'm getting paid
to do what I love.

06:00.319 --> 06:02.696
Yeah.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.115
It's just,

06:05.115 --> 06:08.285
I always imagined more.

06:11.747 --> 06:15.084
I thought I'd be a star.

06:15.084 --> 06:19.296
But now I'm starting to wonder,

06:19.296 --> 06:21.507
what if I'm not?

06:25.427 --> 06:28.806
Am I okay with "good enough?"

06:28.806 --> 06:31.266
Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me?

06:31.266 --> 06:32.851
I'm all for
beautiful Black love,

06:32.851 --> 06:35.771
but you can't keep
fucking on my set.

06:35.771 --> 06:37.189
We got here early

06:37.189 --> 06:38.690
and got caught in the moment.

06:38.690 --> 06:39.858
Again?

06:39.858 --> 06:41.276
But that explains

06:41.276 --> 06:43.237
why you haven't
texted back, Angie.

06:43.237 --> 06:44.905
I have been trying
to reach you.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.657
I need you to take a lead role.

06:46.657 --> 06:49.118
- Which part?
- Georgina.

06:49.118 --> 06:50.911
The maid that gets to sing,
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

06:50.911 --> 06:52.454
"no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no,

06:52.454 --> 06:53.914
"no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no,

06:53.914 --> 06:56.500
no, no, no, no" solo,
end of act one.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.918
The very, very, very same.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.294
[laughter]

06:59.294 --> 07:01.338
Perla lost her voice
and had to drop out.

07:01.338 --> 07:02.881
Now get some damn clothes on

07:02.881 --> 07:04.341
and let's get to work.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.552
Oh, you slept your way
to the top

07:06.552 --> 07:08.679
without even knowing it!

07:08.679 --> 07:09.972
Bitch!

07:11.557 --> 07:15.018
Quinn!
[gasps]

07:15.018 --> 07:16.436
It's beautiful.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.773
Oh wow, I feel like
a Disney princess.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.860
If Disney princess were
chic and sophisticated.

07:22.860 --> 07:24.611
- And brown.
- Yes.

07:24.611 --> 07:28.615
Oh, I'm glad that you're happy.

07:28.615 --> 07:32.619
You're gonna make
such a beautiful bride.

07:32.619 --> 07:35.164
Just a few tiny alterations
back here,

07:35.164 --> 07:36.540
and then it'll be perfect,

07:36.540 --> 07:38.917
and I will drop it off
to you tomorrow night.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.419
Just let me get some pins.

07:42.004 --> 07:44.339
And are you absolutely sure

07:44.339 --> 07:46.049
you can't make it
to the wedding?

07:46.049 --> 07:51.013
Oh, yeah, no, I...I can't.

07:51.013 --> 07:52.973
It's just that Ian is
my best friend's ex,

07:52.973 --> 07:55.184
and so even doing this dress

07:55.184 --> 07:57.144
was kind of crossing
the friendship line a bit.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.228
- Ah.
- But going...

07:58.228 --> 07:59.479
Say no more.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.190
Uh, Camille doesn't
want you there.

08:01.190 --> 08:04.568
No! Oh, my God, no, no.

08:04.568 --> 08:07.571
Camille is happy
for you both, okay?

08:07.571 --> 08:10.240
She is so happy.
She is...she has moved on.

08:10.240 --> 08:13.994
She is happily ever after
in love with Jameson.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.662
Like, everybody's happy.

08:15.662 --> 08:19.499
I just wanna make sure that
I'm keeping the peace is all.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.710
Not that there isn't
peace to be kept.

08:21.710 --> 08:25.380
There is...there will be
peace and serenity and love.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.257
[chuckles]

08:27.257 --> 08:29.343
I just, um...I just, uh,

08:29.343 --> 08:31.345
want to make sure
I'm doing the right thing.

08:31.345 --> 08:33.388
[Isabela] Hey, Quinn.

08:33.388 --> 08:36.808
Oh, uh, Isabela? Um, hello.

08:36.808 --> 08:39.019
Did...did we have
an appointment today or...

08:39.019 --> 08:41.230
Uh, no, I just wanted
to drop off

08:41.230 --> 08:43.857
the stuffed animal we won
for JJ at the bowling alley.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.984
You left pretty quickly
and he must've dropped it.

08:45.984 --> 08:47.361
Oh, yeah, yeah, thanks.

08:47.361 --> 08:50.447
Um, I took my boyfriend's
son bowling.

08:50.447 --> 08:52.324
My boyfriend, Shawn.
[chuckles]

08:52.324 --> 08:53.784
He knew about it.

08:53.784 --> 08:54.618
Okay.

08:54.618 --> 08:55.869
Uh, great.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.247
So we can just
leave it right here, and...

08:58.247 --> 08:59.998
okay.

08:59.998 --> 09:02.459
Anything else?
I mean, I'm busy.

09:03.794 --> 09:06.380
Right.

09:06.380 --> 09:07.339
Cool.

09:07.339 --> 09:09.383
[sighs]

09:09.383 --> 09:11.927
Um, what were we talking about?

09:11.927 --> 09:14.179
You were talking about
doing the right thing.

09:14.179 --> 09:15.597
What...what's that
supposed to mean?

09:16.974 --> 09:19.851
Oh, yeah, right.
The right thing.

09:19.851 --> 09:21.311
Yeah, I love doing
the right thing.

09:21.311 --> 09:22.938
I always do the right thing.

09:22.938 --> 09:26.275
Um...okay.

09:26.275 --> 09:28.568
So I think
you're good here, and, um...

09:28.568 --> 09:30.070
[clears throat]

09:30.070 --> 09:31.780
...you can just change,
and then I'll drop it off

09:31.780 --> 09:32.656
to you tomorrow night.

09:32.656 --> 09:35.784
Oh, are we not doing the...

09:35.784 --> 09:38.537
Oh, the pins!
Yes, of course, yes, yes, yes.

09:38.537 --> 09:39.788
We'll pin you, yes.

09:39.788 --> 09:42.624
Go on and I'll pin ya up, yep.

09:42.624 --> 09:45.127
[tense music]

09:45.127 --> 09:47.212
Oh, hi, Tye.

09:47.212 --> 09:48.213
Have you seen this show...

09:48.213 --> 09:49.840
Okay, cut the shit, Brandon.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.425
I'm done playing with you.

09:51.425 --> 09:53.260
- What?
- I've waited for weeks

09:53.260 --> 09:55.012
for you to sign
the divorce papers.

09:55.012 --> 09:56.471
It's obvious you want money.

09:56.471 --> 09:58.765
So 25K,

09:58.765 --> 10:00.517
you sign, you go.

10:00.517 --> 10:03.145
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's not what...wait.

10:03.145 --> 10:05.105
Wait, wait, who said
anything about money?

10:05.105 --> 10:06.857
Drop the act, Brandon!

10:06.857 --> 10:08.317
I'm done putting you up
in my house

10:08.317 --> 10:10.444
while you try to figure out
a way to steal my company.

10:10.444 --> 10:12.529
I worked my ass off
for this shit!

10:12.529 --> 10:14.114
On my own.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.783
35K is as high as I'll go.

10:16.783 --> 10:19.161
Here, sign.

10:19.161 --> 10:21.371
And get your shit.

10:31.089 --> 10:32.883
What happened to you?

10:32.883 --> 10:34.301
I became me.

10:34.301 --> 10:37.637
I didn't sign
the papers because,

10:37.637 --> 10:40.891
crazy as this may sound,

10:40.891 --> 10:43.435
I miss you, Tye.

10:43.435 --> 10:46.396
And I know once I sign
these papers, that's it.

10:46.396 --> 10:49.024
I ain't gonna never
see you again.

10:49.024 --> 10:52.319
You can't blackmail
your way into a relationship.

10:52.319 --> 10:55.322
But you think you can
blackmail me out of one?

10:55.322 --> 10:57.657
You left me without
so much as a goodbye

10:57.657 --> 10:59.493
or so little as a phone number
to keep in touch.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.828
I literally would have died
if I stayed in Georgia.

11:01.828 --> 11:02.913
I get that.

11:02.913 --> 11:04.790
You needed to come out
and find yourself,

11:04.790 --> 11:05.874
and that's awesome.

11:05.874 --> 11:06.750
Good for you.

11:06.750 --> 11:09.961
But, like, was it worth it?

11:09.961 --> 11:12.464
You cut off contact
with me, your family,

11:12.464 --> 11:14.758
everybody who loved you
back home, and for what?

11:14.758 --> 11:17.177
You don't seem
to actually date,

11:17.177 --> 11:18.970
and you got just
a handful of friends

11:18.970 --> 11:20.180
that nobody even knows to call

11:20.180 --> 11:21.181
when you got an emergency?

11:21.181 --> 11:22.140
Don't get it twisted.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.226
Those are my sisters.

11:24.226 --> 11:26.895
Okay, maybe I'm shitty
at updating paperwork.

11:26.895 --> 11:28.730
In fact, if I was better at it,

11:28.730 --> 11:30.065
you wouldn't be here.

11:35.404 --> 11:37.697
[exhales]

11:37.697 --> 11:40.617
But I am sorry, Brandon.

11:43.787 --> 11:46.915
You didn't deserve
the way I treated you.

11:46.915 --> 11:49.793
I really didn't.

11:49.793 --> 11:52.796
But hear this.

11:52.796 --> 11:56.216
You do deserve
how I'm about to treat you.

11:56.216 --> 11:59.428
You think this is about money?

11:59.428 --> 12:01.721
Well, fine.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.432
It's about money, then.

12:17.696 --> 12:18.613
[knocking on door]

12:18.613 --> 12:20.699
Come in.

12:20.699 --> 12:23.285
Hi.

12:23.285 --> 12:25.036
I'm the first one?

12:25.036 --> 12:26.997
These hoes ain't never on time.

12:26.997 --> 12:28.415
Actually, Angie can't make it.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.749
She's still stuck at rehearsal.

12:29.749 --> 12:33.753
And Camille is gonna be
a little late because...

12:33.753 --> 12:35.672
well, because I told Camille
a different time

12:35.672 --> 12:37.382
because I actually
wanted to talk to you

12:37.382 --> 12:39.301
about something alone.

12:39.301 --> 12:40.510
Oh, my God.

12:40.510 --> 12:42.345
I can't deal
with no more drama today.

12:42.345 --> 12:45.390
What? No. No, no, no.
There's no drama.

12:45.390 --> 12:48.185
This is not drama.
This is nothing.

12:49.603 --> 12:50.729
[sighs]

12:50.729 --> 12:53.064
Actually, this is something.

12:53.064 --> 12:56.401
A very big something.

12:56.401 --> 12:57.819
I...

12:59.779 --> 13:03.700
Okay, so, you know
how I've always hated...

13:03.700 --> 13:05.535
okra?

13:05.535 --> 13:07.871
Well, "hate" is actually
a very strong word.

13:07.871 --> 13:09.581
It's not like I've been

13:09.581 --> 13:10.916
okra-phobic
or anything like that.

13:10.916 --> 13:13.543
It's just more like okra...

13:13.543 --> 13:16.421
wasn't for me, you follow me?

13:16.421 --> 13:17.380
I'm trying.

13:17.380 --> 13:18.632
Okay.

13:18.632 --> 13:22.052
And all of my life,
I've really been

13:22.052 --> 13:24.971
a basic burger
type of chick, you know?

13:24.971 --> 13:29.976
And...okra has been
on my mind recently

13:29.976 --> 13:33.855
and has made me
a little...curious.

13:33.855 --> 13:36.733
Pat, I'd like to solve
the puzzle.

13:36.733 --> 13:37.943
Is okra pussy?

13:40.320 --> 13:43.406
And here's the thing, it's...
don't get me wrong, okay?

13:43.406 --> 13:45.367
Because it's not like
I don't enjoy

13:45.367 --> 13:46.618
the comfort
of the burger still.

13:46.618 --> 13:48.828
I do.
I mean, the burger is

13:48.828 --> 13:53.833
just nice and sweet and honest.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.294
But this one okra in particular

13:56.294 --> 13:58.797
has really been
on my mind. and...

13:58.797 --> 14:01.341
So you want to fuck a woman?

14:01.341 --> 14:04.427
[laughing]
Oh, my God! I did not...

14:04.427 --> 14:05.720
okay, look.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.138
[mimics springing, laughs]

14:07.138 --> 14:08.848
Um, I am not comfortable

14:08.848 --> 14:11.268
calling it anything
other than curiosity right now.

14:11.268 --> 14:14.396
Well, I've been
on the receiving end

14:14.396 --> 14:17.315
of one too many
curious straight girls'

14:17.315 --> 14:19.693
experimental nights
and fantasies,

14:19.693 --> 14:20.694
which only ended up

14:20.694 --> 14:23.071
leaving me invested
and then hurt.

14:23.071 --> 14:25.532
So let me give you
a word of advice.

14:25.532 --> 14:28.243
Maybe leave that okra
the hell alone

14:28.243 --> 14:30.078
until you know
what you really want!

14:30.078 --> 14:31.329
[exhales]

14:31.329 --> 14:33.290
Wow, I...

14:33.290 --> 14:35.542
I am really sorry, Tye.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.793
I was not trying to offend you.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.962
- I was just...
[Tye] No, I'm sorry.

14:38.962 --> 14:41.756
I just...

14:41.756 --> 14:43.758
I lied about my ex.

14:43.758 --> 14:45.302
I don't want the other girls
to know yet,

14:45.302 --> 14:47.512
but he didn't sign
the divorce papers.

14:47.512 --> 14:49.472
- What?
[knock at door]

14:49.472 --> 14:51.683
Oh, I thought I was early.

14:51.683 --> 14:53.393
What'd I miss?

14:53.393 --> 14:55.061
Nothing.

14:55.061 --> 14:59.232
We're just bullshitting
about the weather wives.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.067
What have you been up to?

15:01.067 --> 15:02.694
Nothing.

15:02.694 --> 15:04.404
Well, everything.
Well, not everything,

15:04.404 --> 15:05.780
but a lot of things.

15:05.780 --> 15:07.157
Yeah, there's a lot
of nothing-everything

15:07.157 --> 15:09.200
going around.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.202
Jameson asked me to go
with him to Chicago.

15:11.202 --> 15:12.162
Oh, shit.

15:12.162 --> 15:13.705
Every man wants you to move.

15:13.705 --> 15:15.248
Not every man.

15:15.248 --> 15:18.668
But yes,
we've been here before.

15:18.668 --> 15:21.379
Well, the other man
that wanted me to go,

15:21.379 --> 15:23.089
the Ian man,

15:23.089 --> 15:24.924
there's a tiny little detail
I omitted

15:24.924 --> 15:26.509
from my crazy
kidnapping Ian night.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.681
Ian told me that
he's still in love with me.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.099
- [gasps]
[Camille] And the moment

15:33.099 --> 15:35.560
he said it out loud,

15:35.560 --> 15:36.936
I knew that I felt it too.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.563
[both gasp]

15:38.563 --> 15:40.607
I'm still in love with Ian.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.609
- There, I said it.
- My God!

15:42.609 --> 15:44.736
You're like Rachel McAdams
in The Notebook.

15:44.736 --> 15:46.696
You're caught between
two good men.

15:46.696 --> 15:48.615
Can we take
a second to talk about

15:48.615 --> 15:50.408
how awful that ending
actually was?

15:50.408 --> 15:52.035
I mean, the girl
gets Alzheimer's

15:52.035 --> 15:54.204
and then she forgets
who her husband actually is,

15:54.204 --> 15:55.246
and then they both die.

15:55.246 --> 15:56.831
Okay, hello, spoiler!

15:56.831 --> 15:57.791
I forgot about the end.

15:57.791 --> 15:58.792
You guys, please.

15:58.792 --> 15:59.918
This is not a movie though.

15:59.918 --> 16:02.087
This is real life.

16:02.087 --> 16:03.672
I need you to tell me
what to do.

16:03.672 --> 16:06.383
Tell him, all right?
You let him go once.

16:06.383 --> 16:08.927
Tell him how you feel
before he's married

16:08.927 --> 16:10.720
and it's too late.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.430
Yeah, but isn't that
the shittiest thing ever,

16:12.430 --> 16:14.182
if I say something
and I break them up?

16:14.182 --> 16:15.600
Yeah, but then
aren't you shitty

16:15.600 --> 16:16.935
if you still let them
get married,

16:16.935 --> 16:19.229
knowing that he's
still in love with you?

16:19.229 --> 16:22.357
I don't know.

16:22.357 --> 16:24.693
Yes?

16:24.693 --> 16:27.570
But the one thing
I know for sure right now

16:27.570 --> 16:31.116
is that Jameson is the guy
of my fairy-tale dreams.

16:31.116 --> 16:34.369
You know,
he's the happy ending, right?

16:34.369 --> 16:37.080
What do I do?

16:37.080 --> 16:41.543
Do I go after my fresh start?

16:41.543 --> 16:44.421
Or do I go after my heart?

16:44.421 --> 16:47.966
Yeah, there's a lot of that
going around today too.

16:47.966 --> 16:50.969
[all sighing]

16:54.639 --> 16:56.599
Oh, my God.

16:56.599 --> 16:59.936
I just remembered
the worst news of the day.

16:59.936 --> 17:02.939
We still have to sit through

17:02.939 --> 17:05.358
fucking Get Out, again.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.277
[all groan]

17:07.277 --> 17:10.572
[both vocalizing]

17:10.572 --> 17:12.031
- Ha, ha, let's go!
- Yes!

17:12.031 --> 17:13.032
Oh, my God, I wonder
who's here today.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.117
Angie?

17:14.117 --> 17:15.493
Angie.
[clears throat]

17:15.493 --> 17:17.120
Hey. Hi.
[chuckles]

17:19.831 --> 17:22.876
Look, I know we got off
on the wrong foot.

17:22.876 --> 17:24.461
"We"?

17:24.461 --> 17:26.629
But I just wanted to say

17:26.629 --> 17:28.715
this role is your destiny,

17:28.715 --> 17:32.719
and me and the show
and all of us,

17:32.719 --> 17:34.679
we are all the better for it.

17:34.679 --> 17:36.723
I'm the grudge-holding type.

17:36.723 --> 17:39.058
Girl, bye.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.643
Okay, everyone, gather around.

17:40.643 --> 17:43.021
Gather around, gather around.
[chuckles]

17:43.021 --> 17:45.523
The moment we've all
been waiting for.

17:45.523 --> 17:47.358
I have some really
exciting news.

17:47.358 --> 17:49.569
Production handed me
this letter

17:49.569 --> 17:52.071
sent by Mr. Jordan Peele
himself.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.865
[Kate] Stop!
- Oh, my God.

17:53.865 --> 17:55.825
Jordan asked that we read it
before tonight's show,

17:55.825 --> 17:57.619
so let's do it.

17:57.619 --> 17:59.245
[excited chatter]

17:59.245 --> 18:00.997
[clears throat]

18:00.997 --> 18:03.666
"Hey, everybody."
[laughs]

18:03.666 --> 18:06.377
"I heard you guys were doing
the musical version of Get Out

18:06.377 --> 18:10.173
when one of your castmates,
Angela Wilson"...

18:10.173 --> 18:11.758
[chuckles]

18:11.758 --> 18:13.927
"...sent my agent
thoughts on the script

18:13.927 --> 18:15.887
"and reasons why
the Sunken Place dancer

18:15.887 --> 18:17.263
needed more lines in a solo."

18:17.263 --> 18:19.724
- That's my Angie!
- Okay!

18:19.724 --> 18:21.851
"Well, imagine my surprise,

18:21.851 --> 18:23.812
"as this is not...

18:23.812 --> 18:27.607
"legally sanctioned or approved

18:27.607 --> 18:29.567
or, I'm sad to say, happening."

18:29.567 --> 18:30.860
What the fuck?

18:30.860 --> 18:32.362
No.

18:32.362 --> 18:34.322
No. No.

18:34.322 --> 18:37.784
No, no, no, no, no, no.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.911
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no,

18:39.911 --> 18:42.747
no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

18:42.747 --> 18:45.959
But...but I'm the lead.
The show must go on.

18:45.959 --> 18:48.419
"Enclosed is a cease and desist
letter from my attorney."

18:48.419 --> 18:51.631
- Great.
- "This show must not go on.

18:51.631 --> 18:52.924
"Ever.

18:52.924 --> 18:54.300
"The theatre manager
has been told

18:54.300 --> 18:58.471
that Get Out the Musical
needs to, well, get out."

18:58.471 --> 19:02.100
[upbeat music]

19:02.100 --> 19:05.270
[Camille]
Round six! Here we go.

19:05.270 --> 19:08.231
Jordan fucking Peele.

19:08.231 --> 19:11.276
Girl, fuck him.

19:11.276 --> 19:12.944
I do love him though.

19:12.944 --> 19:16.114
He is the best, and that movie?

19:16.114 --> 19:17.532
Ugh, he's so talented.

19:17.532 --> 19:20.743
My failure is having déjà vu.

19:20.743 --> 19:23.454
It's my record deal
all over again.

19:23.454 --> 19:25.415
I swallowed my pride.

19:25.415 --> 19:26.875
I worked my ass off,

19:26.875 --> 19:28.543
and it was for nothing.

19:28.543 --> 19:30.378
Maybe I'll never be a star.

19:30.378 --> 19:33.673
[Tye] Oh, Ang!
- Angie, baby!

19:33.673 --> 19:36.342
I think Ang needs
a plan B, y'all.

19:36.342 --> 19:37.677
[Tye] No, you got plan A!

19:37.677 --> 19:39.387
- Don't you give up!
- Don't give up!

19:39.387 --> 19:43.892
No, literally, a Plan B
before CVS closes.

19:43.892 --> 19:46.394
Me and Eric been getting lazy
with the protection,

19:46.394 --> 19:48.521
and that shit only works
for three days.

19:48.521 --> 19:51.107
Well, I gotta jet too.

19:51.107 --> 19:53.359
You know, Brandon think
he can take my money,

19:53.359 --> 19:55.194
but he can't take it

19:55.194 --> 19:57.655
from the comfort
of my guest room.

19:57.655 --> 19:58.781
Fuck him!

19:58.781 --> 20:00.950
Mm-kay, put his ass out.

20:00.950 --> 20:02.201
You need backup?

20:02.201 --> 20:03.870
No, girl, I got this on my own.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.538
Okay, all right,
then bartender,

20:05.538 --> 20:07.040
can we get another round?

20:07.040 --> 20:09.500
Two please!

20:09.500 --> 20:11.920
Thanks, Richard.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.756
- Cheers.
- Mm.

20:14.756 --> 20:16.007
Mm-mmm!

20:16.007 --> 20:17.926
Mm!

20:17.926 --> 20:19.636
When was the last time
we were drunk like this?

20:19.636 --> 20:22.221
- I have never been this drunk.
- Lies, bitch.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.765
Okay, remember at
your 25th birthday?

20:23.765 --> 20:26.726
- Six Flags?
- Oh, shit!

20:26.726 --> 20:29.187
Oh, shit,
we are banished for life.

20:29.187 --> 20:30.980
[both laugh]

20:30.980 --> 20:34.150
Oh, my God, good times.

20:34.150 --> 20:35.902
Ugh, but for real,
we have not had

20:35.902 --> 20:37.362
an epic night since then.

20:37.362 --> 20:38.821
You know what it is?

20:38.821 --> 20:40.406
I am so scared that, like,

20:40.406 --> 20:42.200
one of my students
is gonna see me,

20:42.200 --> 20:43.326
and then they're
gonna videotape me,

20:43.326 --> 20:44.327
and then I'm gonna get fired.

20:44.327 --> 20:47.205
And I'm afraid that...

20:47.205 --> 20:48.623
I'm just afraid in general.

20:48.623 --> 20:49.832
You know what?

20:49.832 --> 20:51.751
We have been good.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.212
We've been so good for so long.
Where has that gotten us?

20:54.212 --> 20:55.546
- Nowhere.
[Camille] Nowhere!

20:55.546 --> 20:57.632
Girl, because we have just
been trying to live up

20:57.632 --> 20:59.926
to everybody's expectations,
and for what?

20:59.926 --> 21:01.678
[mimics explosion]
For what?

21:01.678 --> 21:03.596
We need to just do us!

21:03.596 --> 21:04.931
[whispers] Yes.

21:04.931 --> 21:08.142
Life, here we come.

21:08.142 --> 21:11.896
[Tye] Brandon, you gonna get
out of my goddamn house!

21:11.896 --> 21:15.149
Brandon? Bran...

21:16.651 --> 21:20.363
and I don't give a fuck...

21:20.363 --> 21:22.031
You needed to come out
and find yourself,

21:22.031 --> 21:23.574
and that's awesome.

21:23.574 --> 21:25.410
Was it worth it?

21:25.410 --> 21:27.328
You don't seem
to actually date.

21:27.328 --> 21:29.080
Fuck you.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.540
Poor Tye.

21:30.540 --> 21:31.958
I need a time out.

21:31.958 --> 21:34.711
Please, don't do this!

21:39.507 --> 21:43.344
and you didn't hold me down...

21:43.344 --> 21:46.389
- This is gonna be so great.
- Mm-hmm!

21:46.389 --> 21:48.307
[Quinn] Oh, there's Dard!
- Hey, ladies.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.600
[both] Hey, Dard!
- Hey, beautiful.

21:49.600 --> 21:50.893
Oh, my God,
can we get some of that

21:50.893 --> 21:51.853
Harlem champagne?

21:51.853 --> 21:52.895
Two bottles!

21:52.895 --> 21:54.188
You guys had enough
to drink tonight,

21:54.188 --> 21:55.106
but maybe next time.

21:55.106 --> 21:57.233
- I promise.
[both] No!

21:57.233 --> 21:58.693
- Gorgeous, both of you.
- Okay.

21:58.693 --> 22:00.737
- Thank you.
- Okay, you too.

22:00.737 --> 22:01.654
Okay, was he hitting on me?

22:01.654 --> 22:02.697
I think he was hitting on you!

22:02.697 --> 22:04.449
Bitch!

22:04.449 --> 22:06.200
Hey, Harlem!

22:06.200 --> 22:08.745
We are doing us. Mm-hmm.

22:08.745 --> 22:10.747
But who is us? Is that English?

22:10.747 --> 22:12.749
I don't know, I mean,
it sounded like words to me.

22:12.749 --> 22:14.000
- Yeah.
- Whoop! Ooh.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.209
I think I just peed a little.

22:15.209 --> 22:17.503
- Ooh.
- It's fine. It'll dry.

22:19.380 --> 22:22.008
- You know, Quinn...
- Mm-hmm.

22:22.008 --> 22:26.596
I never pictured a life
for myself without academia.

22:26.596 --> 22:28.473
But, you know, at some point,

22:28.473 --> 22:30.641
don't you just
have to say fuck it

22:30.641 --> 22:32.351
and stop trying
to push your way in?

22:32.351 --> 22:34.353
You know, just...

22:34.353 --> 22:37.148
Hell yeah. Absolutely.

22:37.148 --> 22:40.526
Quitting Chase was
the best decision I ever made.

22:40.526 --> 22:42.111
Mm.

22:42.111 --> 22:45.573
Wait, so you think
I should quit?

22:45.573 --> 22:47.533
I'm not saying.
I'm just saying.

22:47.533 --> 22:49.285
Should I quit?

22:53.414 --> 22:55.208
Camille.

22:55.208 --> 22:57.210
What are you doing here?
It's late.

22:57.210 --> 22:58.961
You look really pretty
at night.

22:58.961 --> 23:00.254
[Dr. Pruitt] Thank you.

23:00.254 --> 23:02.381
I feel like you've had
a couple of cocktails.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.217
I had a couple dozen cocktails.

23:04.217 --> 23:05.635
And you know what?

23:05.635 --> 23:08.221
That won't change the fact
that I am done

23:08.221 --> 23:10.264
trying to prove
that I am worthy,

23:10.264 --> 23:13.267
because I know that I am.

23:15.019 --> 23:16.979
And you know what?
You know what else?

23:16.979 --> 23:19.315
I know that I should
do my research

23:19.315 --> 23:21.526
and journals and all
the whatevers and stuff,

23:21.526 --> 23:23.277
but I am really proud

23:23.277 --> 23:27.782
of my social media presence.

23:27.782 --> 23:30.535
And also, do you wanna
know why my classes

23:30.535 --> 23:32.495
are always waitlisted?

23:32.495 --> 23:33.996
Why the number
of Black students

23:33.996 --> 23:35.456
majoring in anthropology

23:35.456 --> 23:37.375
has increased
in the last few years?

23:37.375 --> 23:40.753
Because not only
can they see me,

23:40.753 --> 23:42.380
but they can access me,

23:42.380 --> 23:45.049
which lets them know
that they can be me.

23:45.049 --> 23:46.717
So whether you like it or not,

23:46.717 --> 23:49.595
social media is
here to stay, okay?

23:49.595 --> 23:51.806
And, uh, I'm not.

23:51.806 --> 23:53.975
I quit. I'm outta here.

23:53.975 --> 23:56.310
Camille, I feel
a little blindsided.

23:56.310 --> 23:58.563
Have you been talking
to other colleges?

23:58.563 --> 23:59.730
I'm not.

23:59.730 --> 24:01.524
For the first time
in my adult life,

24:01.524 --> 24:02.775
I don't have a plan
on what's next,

24:02.775 --> 24:04.986
and you know what?

24:04.986 --> 24:06.946
[whispers]
It feels fucking great.

24:06.946 --> 24:08.781
[pops lips]

24:10.700 --> 24:12.618
Try not to fall down my steps.

24:12.618 --> 24:15.788
See you never, Dr. Pruitt.
Okay?

24:15.788 --> 24:17.582
- Oh, shit.
- [screams]

24:17.582 --> 24:19.167
Oh, shit, shit. Are you okay?

24:19.167 --> 24:20.668
- Yeah.
- Come on.

24:20.668 --> 24:21.711
- Oh, my God.
- Up, up, up.

24:21.711 --> 24:23.087
- I did it! Okay.
- You did it!

24:23.087 --> 24:24.088
Now it's your turn.

24:24.088 --> 24:26.007
Let's go get your lady.

24:26.007 --> 24:28.301
- I blew up my life!
- Yes!

24:28.301 --> 24:30.303
[indistinct shouting]
- Bye, bitch!

24:30.303 --> 24:33.139
- Ah!
- Shh!

24:33.139 --> 24:36.726
just like the Masters...

24:36.726 --> 24:40.062
You said if she was here
that it was fate!

24:40.062 --> 24:42.940
Okay, well, if I go in,
you have to promise me

24:42.940 --> 24:44.442
that if I say something,

24:44.442 --> 24:45.985
that you're not gonna
be weird with me,

24:45.985 --> 24:48.237
and then if I change
my mind and don't,

24:48.237 --> 24:50.823
then you're not
gonna be mad at me.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.491
Quinn,

24:52.491 --> 24:55.578
we are so much more
than who we love.

24:55.578 --> 24:56.787
- Right.
- Okay?

24:56.787 --> 24:58.956
And honestly,
if I was gonna judge you,

24:58.956 --> 25:01.667
there was, like,
so many guys, like,

25:01.667 --> 25:04.670
I would have bailed
on this friendship, you know?

25:04.670 --> 25:08.549
- Yeah.
- But she at least has a job.

25:08.549 --> 25:10.843
- That's true.
- Yeah.

25:10.843 --> 25:12.220
Okay, here I go.

25:12.220 --> 25:13.888
Okay.

25:21.604 --> 25:23.189
Isabela?

25:23.189 --> 25:25.233
Hi. I was just, um...

25:25.233 --> 25:27.360
wow, I like your place.

25:27.360 --> 25:28.778
I should have come by sooner.

25:28.778 --> 25:30.196
Are you okay?

25:30.196 --> 25:32.698
Yes, I am fine, thank you.

25:32.698 --> 25:34.408
And yourself, good lady?

25:34.408 --> 25:35.993
You had a couple
cocktails tonight?

25:35.993 --> 25:38.621
I mean, a night out
with the girls.

25:38.621 --> 25:41.082
Oh, my God, school supplies.

25:41.082 --> 25:42.750
Oh, I love school supplies.

25:42.750 --> 25:44.835
I used to get them
all the time as a kid,

25:44.835 --> 25:49.382
like, notebooks and pens
and Wite-Out and...

25:49.382 --> 25:50.967
do they even make
Wite-Out anymore?

25:50.967 --> 25:54.428
Yeah. Fun.

25:54.428 --> 25:56.347
Well, um,

25:56.347 --> 25:57.598
I just wanted to come by

25:57.598 --> 26:00.226
and say I was sorry
for being rude before.

26:00.226 --> 26:02.311
It's fine. You were busy.

26:02.311 --> 26:04.772
No, I was a bitch.
[scoffs]

26:04.772 --> 26:06.274
I was a fucking bitch, okay?

26:06.274 --> 26:07.817
I was like one of my customers

26:07.817 --> 26:09.527
or, like, my mom.

26:09.527 --> 26:10.736
Oh, God!

26:10.736 --> 26:12.113
And the point is,

26:12.113 --> 26:13.572
is I was just acting
a little weird

26:13.572 --> 26:14.782
because I was caught off guard

26:14.782 --> 26:17.118
because I never really
considered, like,

26:17.118 --> 26:19.036
okra before,
you know what I'm saying?

26:19.036 --> 26:22.623
But, like, I also haven't had
okra offered to me in this way.

26:22.623 --> 26:26.627
And so whether or not
I take the okra,

26:26.627 --> 26:29.088
I just didn't want you
to feel like okra

26:29.088 --> 26:31.382
that I tossed in the trash.

26:31.382 --> 26:34.093
I never offered you any okra.

26:34.093 --> 26:37.471
Well, yeah, that's because
I never gave you the chance.

26:37.471 --> 26:38.973
And I know
it's a really big step,

26:38.973 --> 26:40.975
but how am I gonna know
if I don't try?

26:40.975 --> 26:43.311
So I just wanted to try.
So this is me trying.

26:43.311 --> 26:46.022
So here we go.

26:46.022 --> 26:47.940
Isabela,

26:47.940 --> 26:51.444
will you go on a date with me?

26:51.444 --> 26:55.031
[upbeat music]

26:55.031 --> 26:56.657
She said yes!

26:56.657 --> 26:59.744
[both screaming]

26:59.744 --> 27:01.287
It's official!

27:01.287 --> 27:04.790
I'm an LGBTQ, baby!

27:04.790 --> 27:06.292
[phone buzzes]
- Oh, wait, I'm buzzing,

27:06.292 --> 27:07.585
I'm buzzing.

27:07.585 --> 27:09.754
- Like a bee.

27:09.754 --> 27:12.631
Oh, shit, Mira.

27:12.631 --> 27:15.176
I was supposed to drop off
her dress at the Palace.

27:15.176 --> 27:17.762
Do you wanna call this a night?

27:17.762 --> 27:20.056
- No!
- We're just gonna go home.

27:20.056 --> 27:22.558
- We're taking her home.
- No, no, we're not.

27:22.558 --> 27:24.018
Okay, you know what?

27:24.018 --> 27:25.311
Seeing the dress,

27:25.311 --> 27:27.438
it's not gonna change the fact

27:27.438 --> 27:29.106
that he's still
getting married.

27:33.778 --> 27:36.155
that means the most...

27:36.155 --> 27:37.323
[Camille grunting]

27:37.323 --> 27:39.241
Okay, okay.

27:39.241 --> 27:41.160
All right. All right.
I'm just gonna go in

27:41.160 --> 27:42.870
and come out and we'll be done.

27:42.870 --> 27:45.039
- Okay.
- Okay.

27:45.039 --> 27:46.999
Oh, but this is so weird.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.584
No.

27:48.584 --> 27:50.586
I mean, wouldn't it be
weirder if I went in?

27:50.586 --> 27:51.962
- True.
- Yeah.

27:51.962 --> 27:55.508
- I'll be quick.
- Yeah, totally.

27:59.762 --> 28:01.889
[Camille] The thing that
all classic fairytales have

28:01.889 --> 28:05.601
in common is the infamous
"all is lost" moment.

28:05.601 --> 28:07.395
The princess is powerless,

28:07.395 --> 28:10.481
her fate entirely
in the man's hands.

28:10.481 --> 28:12.316
Will he come rescue her?

28:12.316 --> 28:14.610
Or maybe she'll rescue herself.

28:14.610 --> 28:16.821
[]

29:18.424 --> 29:20.176
[inhales]

29:28.100 --> 29:31.896
[]

29:31.896 --> 29:34.773
- Ladies and gentlemen,
for their first dance,

29:34.773 --> 29:37.776
Mr. and Mrs. Ian Walker.

29:37.776 --> 29:40.905
[applause]

30:18.400 --> 30:22.071
[clock bonging]

30:25.074 --> 30:28.077
[dramatic music]

30:40.756 --> 30:41.840
Camille?

30:41.840 --> 30:44.677
[Camille] Shit!

30:44.677 --> 30:45.928
Hi.

30:45.928 --> 30:48.305
Um...

30:48.305 --> 30:49.723
I, um...

30:49.723 --> 30:52.768
I was just here with Quinn,
who's, um,

30:52.768 --> 30:54.478
dropping off Mira's gown.

30:54.478 --> 30:57.106
So yeah, it's...
it's really beautiful.

30:57.106 --> 31:02.278
I was looking for a restroom
and couldn't find it.

31:02.278 --> 31:04.238
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

31:04.238 --> 31:05.573
The bathroom's down the hall.

31:05.573 --> 31:06.615
Right.

31:06.615 --> 31:09.368
Why do...why do you have that?

31:09.368 --> 31:13.038
Oh, well, um, uh,

31:13.038 --> 31:15.583
apparently, when I'm drunk,
I take signs.

31:15.583 --> 31:19.253
I...um, I'm just gonna
put it back.

31:21.714 --> 31:23.841
And find the restroom.

31:27.303 --> 31:29.972
Look.

31:29.972 --> 31:31.140
The real reason
that I came in here

31:31.140 --> 31:33.392
is not to use the bathroom.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.394
I don't know if I was

31:35.394 --> 31:37.855
hoping I could stop this or...

31:37.855 --> 31:42.026
hoping that you would, but...

31:42.026 --> 31:43.402
you said you love me.

31:46.697 --> 31:51.327
I love you too, Ian.

31:51.327 --> 31:54.496
I love you in a way
that doesn't just go away.

31:56.749 --> 31:59.209
You're my home.

31:59.209 --> 32:02.504
My heart.

32:02.504 --> 32:05.883
Since we met
all those years ago,

32:05.883 --> 32:07.343
it's never gone away.

32:14.642 --> 32:16.060
Why the fuck
would you say this to me

32:16.060 --> 32:18.062
the night before my wedding?

32:18.062 --> 32:20.731
Well...well, why are you
still getting married

32:20.731 --> 32:21.732
if you're in love with me?

32:21.732 --> 32:23.734
Look, Cam,

32:23.734 --> 32:25.986
shit got crazy
the other night, all right?

32:25.986 --> 32:27.613
I got caught up
in the emotion of it all,

32:27.613 --> 32:28.864
- and I shouldn't...
- So you don't love me?

32:28.864 --> 32:30.324
- Doesn't matter.
- It does matter!

32:30.324 --> 32:31.867
No, it doesn't!

32:31.867 --> 32:33.702
In a few hours,
my family, Mira's family,

32:33.702 --> 32:35.245
our friends, everyone we love

32:35.245 --> 32:37.539
are gonna be here,
watching us get married.

32:37.539 --> 32:39.041
I'm marrying her.

32:41.835 --> 32:44.088
This is the exact wrong time
to be having this conversation.

32:44.088 --> 32:45.464
Maybe it's the exact right time

32:45.464 --> 32:48.550
to be having
this fucking conversation.

32:48.550 --> 32:52.012
Do you love me?

32:52.012 --> 32:53.555
Say that you don't.

32:53.555 --> 32:55.391
Or say that
it was just the night,

32:55.391 --> 32:58.352
and I'll leave.

32:58.352 --> 33:00.938
But I need to hear you say it.

33:04.608 --> 33:09.321
Camille, I mean...

33:09.321 --> 33:13.033
yeah.

33:13.033 --> 33:15.911
Yeah.

33:15.911 --> 33:19.123
I love you.

33:19.123 --> 33:21.041
Now what?

33:21.041 --> 33:22.876
You already broke
my heart once.

33:22.876 --> 33:25.462
Five years ago, I wasn't ready

33:25.462 --> 33:26.672
to take that leap of faith

33:26.672 --> 33:28.465
until I knew that
you were committed.

33:28.465 --> 33:30.467
I bought you a ring.

33:30.467 --> 33:32.052
What?

33:32.052 --> 33:33.429
I maxed out every card I had

33:33.429 --> 33:36.432
to get you
that fucking ring, Cam.

33:36.432 --> 33:38.434
Sorry.

33:38.434 --> 33:40.310
I may not have the most money.

33:40.310 --> 33:42.271
You know, I'm not the most
talented chef.

33:42.271 --> 33:44.064
I didn't have much back then,

33:44.064 --> 33:47.776
but everything I had,

33:47.776 --> 33:50.195
I'd have given you.

33:53.198 --> 33:54.992
This was supposed to be you.

33:54.992 --> 33:59.121
[]

33:59.121 --> 34:01.373
It was always
supposed to be you.
