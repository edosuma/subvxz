01:02:43.917 --> 01:02:46.886

01:02:46.953 --> 01:02:48.011
Hey, yo!

01:02:48.855 --> 01:02:50.083
Can l talk to you a minute?

01:02:51.324 --> 01:02:52.484
Come on, please?

01:02:53.793 --> 01:02:54.657

01:02:55.195 --> 01:02:56.219
Alone?

01:02:57.530 --> 01:02:59.430
l'll get the car. Be right there

01:03:04.237 --> 01:03:05.397
Who sent you the flowers?

01:03:07.774 --> 01:03:09.002
None of your business

01:03:10.076 --> 01:03:12.874
Okay. l just wanted to say...

01:03:12.979 --> 01:03:14.674
You and me ain't got no ties

01:03:20.253 --> 01:03:22.187
l have a problem with pussy

01:03:22.689 --> 01:03:25.385
l always have, and l always will

01:03:25.725 --> 01:03:26.851
But l meant what l said

01:03:26.927 --> 01:03:30.920
l don't care about your problems. l did write it for you

01:03:32.699 --> 01:03:36.066
But l did tell her l would teach her, and l did fuck her

01:03:36.736 --> 01:03:39.762
Who you fuck is your business l won't make it mine

01:03:41.675 --> 01:03:45.042
lt's not like l'm seeing any money for writing that number

01:03:46.179 --> 01:03:48.670
l may as well touch a little pussy

01:03:51.318 --> 01:03:53.286
You got nothing to say

01:03:54.054 --> 01:03:55.419
No

01:03:56.556 --> 01:03:58.023
Thanks for the flowers!

01:03:58.959 --> 01:04:00.517
Tony said you did great!

01:04:01.428 --> 01:04:03.225
l never got flowers before

01:04:04.431 --> 01:04:07.229
l'm sure you'll get lots of them

01:04:09.436 --> 01:04:10.698
He gave them to you?

01:04:11.771 --> 01:04:12.965
Yeah, he did

01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:15.833
What is he? A pimp?

01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:18.743
Only people with pimp cars are pimps

01:04:19.279 --> 01:04:21.577
He's the entertainment director

01:04:21.648 --> 01:04:23.513
That's what l said. He's a pimp!

01:04:23.883 --> 01:04:25.043
Let's go!

01:04:28.588 --> 01:04:30.522
Good luck with your number

01:04:54.981 --> 01:04:56.710
Hello?

01:04:59.219 --> 01:05:00.846
Anybody here?

01:05:04.391 --> 01:05:06.120
What are you doing here?

01:05:06.426 --> 01:05:08.724
What am l doing here?

01:05:10.130 --> 01:05:14.362
Doing some of the finest cocaine in the world. Want some?

01:05:19.372 --> 01:05:21.533
lt's great for the muscles

01:05:24.677 --> 01:05:27.612
l told Marty l'd work on turns with you...

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:30.308
but l'm feeling a little inside-out

01:05:30.650 --> 01:05:32.083
Cut the shit

01:05:32.485 --> 01:05:33.543
Okay

01:05:34.654 --> 01:05:37.555
We got off on the wrong foot

01:05:38.258 --> 01:05:40.317
Want to start dancing all over again?

01:05:41.361 --> 01:05:43.295
Why?

01:05:43.363 --> 01:05:44.887
Why not?

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:49.098
Want to go eat at Spago?

01:05:49.169 --> 01:05:50.295
Where is it?

01:05:50.603 --> 01:05:52.036
Just down from Ver-sayce

01:05:52.939 --> 01:05:54.133

01:05:54.207 --> 01:05:57.199
Ahh, right. Versace

Enjoy

01:06:16.463 --> 01:06:18.192

01:06:21.267 --> 01:06:23.531
l'll have brown rice and vegetables

01:06:24.904 --> 01:06:27.668
Do you like brown rice and vegetables?

01:06:29.342 --> 01:06:30.604
You do?

01:06:31.578 --> 01:06:32.806
Sort of

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:35.279
Really?

01:06:38.384 --> 01:06:40.579
lt's worse than dog food

01:06:41.154 --> 01:06:42.246
lt is

01:06:44.724 --> 01:06:47.090
l've had dog food

01:06:48.595 --> 01:06:49.994
You have?

01:06:51.564 --> 01:06:53.259
A long time ago

01:06:54.267 --> 01:06:56.201
Doggy chow

01:06:57.370 --> 01:06:59.736
l used to love Doggy Chow

01:07:00.373 --> 01:07:02.841
l used to love Doggy Chow, too

01:07:15.622 --> 01:07:17.522
l got a headache from champagne

01:07:17.924 --> 01:07:20.256
This isn't champagne

01:07:21.261 --> 01:07:24.594
This is holy water

01:07:25.698 --> 01:07:28.030
l named myself after this holy water

01:07:28.501 --> 01:07:32.164
Chrissie Lou Connors had dingy brown hair and little tits

01:07:33.072 --> 01:07:36.940
lt's amazing what paint and a surgeon can do

01:07:45.285 --> 01:07:47.082
You have great tits

01:07:47.854 --> 01:07:49.754
They're beautiful

01:07:50.557 --> 01:07:51.819

01:07:59.199 --> 01:08:01.599
l like having nice tits

01:08:02.769 --> 01:08:04.999
How do you like having them?

01:08:09.309 --> 01:08:10.799
What do you mean?

01:08:11.878 --> 01:08:14.278
You know what l mean

01:08:18.184 --> 01:08:20.948
l like having them in a nice dress...

01:08:21.321 --> 01:08:23.152
or a tight top

01:08:25.758 --> 01:08:28.386
You like to show them off

01:08:30.596 --> 01:08:33.064
l didn't like showing them at the Cheetah

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:35.227
Why not?

01:08:35.602 --> 01:08:39.902
l liked looking at them there. Everybody did

01:08:40.673 --> 01:08:42.334
lt made me feel like a hooker

01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:44.336
You are a whore, darling

01:08:44.410 --> 01:08:45.809

01:08:45.877 --> 01:08:47.310
We all are

01:08:47.714 --> 01:08:52.481
We take the cash, we cash the check, we show them what they want to see

01:08:52.551 --> 01:08:55.282
Maybe you're a whore, but l'm not

01:08:58.457 --> 01:09:00.790
You and me...

01:09:00.893 --> 01:09:04.385
we're exactly alike

01:09:12.505 --> 01:09:14.871

Could l have one like that?

01:09:37.397 --> 01:09:40.194
You want a girl to use up all her lipstick on you?

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.468
Want to dance? Right now?

01:09:43.836 --> 01:09:46.464
lt's now or never. That's what Elvis said

01:09:50.843 --> 01:09:53.710
You know the best advice l ever got?

01:09:53.779 --> 01:09:57.546
You're up there onstage, hoping on a spot

01:09:57.917 --> 01:10:01.250
lf someone gets in your way, step on them

01:10:01.788 --> 01:10:05.781
lf you're the only one left standing there, they hire you

01:10:06.492 --> 01:10:09.154
That's about it. Thank you and good night

01:10:09.262 --> 01:10:12.163
Elvis has left the building

01:11:18.398 --> 01:11:20.457

01:11:46.159 --> 01:11:47.922
Nicky, can l talk to you for a second?

01:11:55.868 --> 01:11:58.336
Mommy, can we see the monkeys? Not now

01:11:58.704 --> 01:12:01.808
Please. They're so cute. They have to work

01:12:01.808 --> 01:12:03.241
What are they doing?

01:12:03.309 --> 01:12:05.436
l want to see the monkeys! Not now

01:12:05.511 --> 01:12:06.910

lt's okay. lt's okay

01:12:27.166 --> 01:12:31.102
Nomi, a boat convention's coming into town next week

01:12:31.204 --> 01:12:33.339

01:12:38.277 --> 01:12:41.178
A thousand dollars? To do what?

Represent the hotel. You wear your costume, smile, they take your picture

01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:48.685
A thousand dollars?

01:13:15.982 --> 01:13:17.916
Molly, l'm waiting

01:13:19.252 --> 01:13:20.651
They didn't like it

01:13:27.059 --> 01:13:28.651
Did you do it before?

01:13:29.328 --> 01:13:30.317
Did you like it?

01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:33.731
Did l like it? Sure, l liked it

01:14:00.126 --> 01:14:05.621
Let's thank these 2 beautiful girls from Goddess'', a new smash at the Stardust''

01:14:11.804 --> 01:14:13.135
Shit

01:14:13.205 --> 01:14:15.308
How's it going? Fine

01:14:15.308 --> 01:14:16.707
Tough gig, huh?

01:14:16.776 --> 01:14:17.902

He's one of our very, very high rollers

01:14:25.484 --> 01:14:28.920
Ladies, we want to take you to dinner after the show

01:14:28.988 --> 01:14:31.957

01:14:32.024 --> 01:14:35.960
You ever heard Caesar sing? The guy's great. You'll love him

01:14:36.696 --> 01:14:37.822
Caesar sing?

01:14:38.230 --> 01:14:41.666
Then we'll go back to my place and we'll sing

01:14:42.201 --> 01:14:43.463
Just the four of us

01:14:44.503 --> 01:14:45.731
How about it?

01:14:49.208 --> 01:14:51.199
We sing

01:14:53.279 --> 01:14:56.373
Yeah, we'll sing a lot of songs

01:14:59.352 --> 01:15:00.341
Okay

01:15:00.620 --> 01:15:02.178
Good deal

01:15:02.254 --> 01:15:05.485
Okay. Good deal

Be nice. Let go of me!

01:15:17.303 --> 01:15:18.861
You got $1,000 for this

01:15:18.938 --> 01:15:21.429
Yeah, for this! This!

01:15:21.874 --> 01:15:23.432
Oh, forget it

01:15:23.676 --> 01:15:26.941
Just forget it! No harm done! No damage!

01:15:27.013 --> 01:15:28.207
Christ!

01:15:36.188 --> 01:15:37.177
Zack?

l want to talk to you

01:15:41.293 --> 01:15:45.161
Let's go upstairs

01:15:45.798 --> 01:15:47.322
Have a nice day, darling?

01:15:49.468 --> 01:15:50.594
No

01:15:53.506 --> 01:15:55.565
l'm sorry to hear that

01:15:58.544 --> 01:15:59.977
Jesus

01:16:03.382 --> 01:16:07.113
l'm sorry. Some people just don't get it

01:16:09.021 --> 01:16:12.184
l'm on the stage. Get me Phil

01:16:13.492 --> 01:16:14.459
Thank you

01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:16.350
Stay

01:16:19.899 --> 01:16:21.867
The drop is up 33% on those machines

01:16:21.967 --> 01:16:25.266
lt will make your bottom line about 250

01:16:29.008 --> 01:16:30.908
l got an MBA for this

01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:36.106
That's what this business is now cost analyzing slot machines

01:16:36.615 --> 01:16:38.583
What's an MBA?

01:16:40.219 --> 01:16:42.016
Zack, you in here?

01:16:43.189 --> 01:16:44.213
Excuse me

01:16:45.357 --> 01:16:47.951
Hey! What's going on?

01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:50.085
You do anything like this again, you're fired

01:16:50.596 --> 01:16:52.791
Nothing happened. Something did!

01:16:53.232 --> 01:16:54.859
She jumped to conclusions

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:59.699
lt happens again, you'll jump to your conclusion

01:17:00.039 --> 01:17:01.939
Without your golden parachute

01:17:03.576 --> 01:17:05.271
You owe her an apology

01:17:08.948 --> 01:17:11.508
Nomi, l'm sorry. l apologize

01:17:12.218 --> 01:17:13.617
Yeah, fine. Okay

01:17:16.922 --> 01:17:18.219
Get out

01:17:21.327 --> 01:17:26.060
An MBA is a college degree. lt's mostly worthless in the real world

01:17:29.435 --> 01:17:31.027
You go for it, don't you?

01:17:32.171 --> 01:17:34.366
Yeah, l try to

01:17:37.710 --> 01:17:39.337
Showtime

01:17:40.012 --> 01:17:41.445
That's for sure

01:17:51.457 --> 01:17:53.755
Phil, you dumb fuck, get back up here

01:17:55.294 --> 01:17:56.727
l know, l know

01:18:05.704 --> 01:18:10.334
Thank you for looking out for me. You were so nice to recommend me to Phil

01:18:10.810 --> 01:18:12.437
What are friends for?

01:18:13.946 --> 01:18:15.072
Right

01:18:22.021 --> 01:18:24.012
You were right about the convention

01:18:25.424 --> 01:18:26.584
Sweet baby!

01:18:27.827 --> 01:18:30.295
Do that again, l'll break your fingers!

01:18:30.362 --> 01:18:32.990
Not my fault you don't have a gay partner

01:18:33.098 --> 01:18:34.122
Fuck you

01:18:34.233 --> 01:18:37.202
He wants everyone to see how hetero he is

01:18:37.303 --> 01:18:40.033
Molly, bring that flashlight so l can see how big it is

01:18:40.406 --> 01:18:42.431
You want a knuckle sandwich?

01:18:42.775 --> 01:18:45.039
Can l have mine anally, please?

01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:47.044
Come on, you guys! Jesus!

01:18:47.112 --> 01:18:48.841
Let's go! Let's line it up!

01:18:49.582 --> 01:18:50.913
What you looking at, bitch?

01:18:51.250 --> 01:18:54.048
Okay, let's go. Move it! Go, go, go!

01:19:32.791 --> 01:19:34.088
Oh, my God

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:03.483
Are you okay, Annie?

01:20:23.142 --> 01:20:24.609
lt's my leg

01:20:24.677 --> 01:20:26.042
Tell me when it hurts

01:20:28.047 --> 01:20:29.036
lt's her knee

01:20:29.481 --> 01:20:30.641
lt isn't broken, is it?

01:20:31.216 --> 01:20:32.683
Daryl, what happened?

01:20:33.085 --> 01:20:34.643
My foot went out from under me

01:20:36.889 --> 01:20:38.754
This is what happened

01:20:42.094 --> 01:20:43.823
l wonder how those got up here?

01:20:44.463 --> 01:20:46.294
Probably came off a costume

01:20:46.665 --> 01:20:48.530
We'll get you to the hospital

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:49.897
Shit, no!

01:20:49.969 --> 01:20:53.405
Jesus. Poor Annie. Tough break

01:20:53.772 --> 01:20:54.796
Let us through here

01:20:59.378 --> 01:21:00.538
See you later

01:21:02.247 --> 01:21:03.236
l'm the producer

01:21:03.315 --> 01:21:05.943
l hired you! You do what l say

01:21:06.018 --> 01:21:08.680
She was my understudy. l have a say, too

01:21:08.754 --> 01:21:11.290
Yeah, but guess who makes the decision

01:21:11.290 --> 01:21:12.655
lt's broken, kids

01:21:13.258 --> 01:21:16.095
Shit. That will be three months

01:21:16.095 --> 01:21:16.891
At least

01:21:19.665 --> 01:21:21.030
Bad karma, huh?

01:21:21.333 --> 01:21:23.130
Nomi, your mother's waiting for you

01:21:24.103 --> 01:21:25.400
My mother?

01:21:25.938 --> 01:21:29.135
For your sake, l hope she's not

01:21:31.110 --> 01:21:33.374
lf a light sleeper sleeps with a light on

01:21:33.445 --> 01:21:35.470
Can a hard sleeper sleep with a hard on?

01:21:35.781 --> 01:21:39.911
What do you call a tiger? A big pussy that eats people

01:21:39.985 --> 01:21:41.077
Henry!

01:21:44.223 --> 01:21:47.021
l can get shit on, but l don't like getting spit on

01:21:49.862 --> 01:21:51.022
Hi, Al

01:21:51.897 --> 01:21:53.091
You look like shit

01:21:53.766 --> 01:21:56.633
She looks better than a 10-inch dick and you know it

01:21:58.303 --> 01:22:01.204
So...do you like it here?

01:22:01.273 --> 01:22:02.638
What, you think she misses you?

01:22:03.308 --> 01:22:04.741
Yeah, why not?

01:22:05.277 --> 01:22:06.676
We miss her

01:22:06.779 --> 01:22:11.045
She misses us like that lump on my twat l had taken off last week

01:22:11.116 --> 01:22:12.344
Jesus, Henry

01:22:20.526 --> 01:22:21.925
We saw the show

01:22:23.595 --> 01:22:25.028
You were good

01:22:27.266 --> 01:22:28.597
Thank you, Al

01:22:33.405 --> 01:22:35.339
Real good

01:22:38.777 --> 01:22:41.143
You take care, kid

01:22:46.351 --> 01:22:50.412
Must be weird, not having anyone come on you

01:22:55.561 --> 01:22:58.428
Nomi. Hey, you want a ride?

01:23:00.999 --> 01:23:01.988
l got one

01:23:06.605 --> 01:23:07.833
Wait!

01:23:11.977 --> 01:23:13.467
Ever been in one of these?

01:23:13.545 --> 01:23:14.375
No

01:23:15.314 --> 01:23:16.713
l always wanted one

01:23:18.984 --> 01:23:21.418
lt's some car, huh? lt doesn't suck

01:23:23.222 --> 01:23:25.588
Where are we headed? Give me directions

01:23:27.693 --> 01:23:29.058
To your place

01:23:48.714 --> 01:23:50.045
Do you like Cristal?

01:23:50.816 --> 01:23:52.909
l like a lot of different champagnes

01:23:54.286 --> 01:23:56.516
But l always drink champagne

01:23:58.223 --> 01:23:59.952
What's Andrew Carver like?

01:24:00.659 --> 01:24:03.560
Are you nervous? Don't be

01:24:04.530 --> 01:24:05.895
l'm not

01:24:11.103 --> 01:24:13.401
l liked it when you came

01:24:16.542 --> 01:24:18.669
l liked your eyes

01:27:29.401 --> 01:27:30.993
Stay with me

01:27:31.737 --> 01:27:33.466
l'll drive you back in the morning

01:27:33.805 --> 01:27:35.272
lt is morning

01:27:35.974 --> 01:27:37.236
Please?

01:27:37.309 --> 01:27:38.640
l have a taxi coming

01:27:39.378 --> 01:27:40.845
Send it back

01:27:46.551 --> 01:27:48.712
Cristal needs a new understudy

01:27:50.255 --> 01:27:53.554
There's an audition at noon. You want to try?

01:27:55.494 --> 01:27:58.361
Would you have told me if l hadn't come here?

01:27:58.730 --> 01:28:01.722
lt was your idea to come here, not mine

01:28:06.204 --> 01:28:08.502
l want to see you again

01:28:09.741 --> 01:28:11.299
We'll see how it goes

01:28:15.347 --> 01:28:17.577
What, the audition?

01:28:27.359 --> 01:28:28.883
Ten-fifty

01:28:38.036 --> 01:28:39.367
Hello!

01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:43.266
l hate you

01:28:44.309 --> 01:28:46.573
Who was he? Zack

01:28:46.912 --> 01:28:48.777
Oh, my God

01:28:49.381 --> 01:28:50.746
Did you tie him up?

01:28:51.183 --> 01:28:52.207
Oh, shit

01:28:53.185 --> 01:28:54.846
l forgot to untie him

01:28:59.524 --> 01:29:00.786
Are you high?

01:29:01.226 --> 01:29:02.955
Maybe a little

01:29:04.863 --> 01:29:09.266
l can't go to sleep. l have an audition at noon. Where are the Sugar Snaps?

01:29:09.634 --> 01:29:11.898
ln the cupboard. Nomi...

01:29:12.304 --> 01:29:14.329
don't get sucked into it

01:29:17.075 --> 01:29:18.633
Look what l found!

01:29:21.446 --> 01:29:23.141
Okay, whatever, Nomes

01:29:53.478 --> 01:29:54.672
Julie

01:29:55.247 --> 01:29:58.080
She's not hot enough. She has it down

01:29:58.283 --> 01:30:01.912
You can teach it. She doesn't have Cristal's heat

01:30:02.254 --> 01:30:04.313
None of them have Cristal's heat

01:30:05.056 --> 01:30:06.785
l do love you, Gay

01:30:07.259 --> 01:30:08.658
Nomi has heat

01:30:10.262 --> 01:30:11.354
Does she?

01:30:12.430 --> 01:30:13.727
Yes, she does

01:30:15.233 --> 01:30:17.292
ln a totally different way

01:30:17.736 --> 01:30:20.500
Come on! She's going to take the lead?

01:30:20.872 --> 01:30:23.636
This a hotel show! lt's not the Cheetah!

01:30:23.975 --> 01:30:27.342
lt doesn't matter l haven't missed a show in 8 years

01:30:27.712 --> 01:30:29.703
You're not getting any younger

01:30:29.881 --> 01:30:31.109
Eat me

01:30:31.850 --> 01:30:33.818
Want to see it again with just Nomi? No

01:30:34.319 --> 01:30:36.253
l do. Set it up, Marty

01:30:36.321 --> 01:30:37.618
This is bullshit

01:30:38.356 --> 01:30:39.846
lt's about your dick

01:30:40.225 --> 01:30:41.453
Nicky, Julie, thank you!

01:30:42.460 --> 01:30:43.688
What do we know about her?

01:30:43.795 --> 01:30:46.696
Nothing. l doubt her Social Security number's right

01:30:46.765 --> 01:30:48.232
Find out. What?

01:30:48.300 --> 01:30:49.392
Everything

01:31:03.982 --> 01:31:05.711
You fucked her, didn't you?

01:31:06.284 --> 01:31:10.687
Are you pissed off because you're jealous?

01:31:10.755 --> 01:31:12.814
Or because l beat you to the punch?

01:31:34.079 --> 01:31:37.879
You fuck him for the spot or because you wanted to?

01:31:40.885 --> 01:31:43.251
l say you did it for the spot

01:31:43.822 --> 01:31:46.484
ls that what you did, Cristal?

01:31:47.092 --> 01:31:50.550
You don't want to piss me off, now that we're friends

01:31:51.096 --> 01:31:54.065
No, you shouldn't get pissed off

01:31:54.366 --> 01:31:55.833
lt makes you look older

01:32:01.573 --> 01:32:05.407
You got it

01:32:06.244 --> 01:32:07.609
l do?

01:32:08.747 --> 01:32:10.408
Marty and Gay will work with you

01:32:10.815 --> 01:32:14.148
Phil will have some glossies taken. You did good

01:32:15.253 --> 01:32:17.653
l'll call you for dinner, lobster

01:32:18.023 --> 01:32:20.719
Did you ever hear Caesar sing? You'll love it

01:32:31.703 --> 01:32:33.227
What?

01:32:34.906 --> 01:32:38.467
Congratulations. l see you have many talents

01:32:39.344 --> 01:32:41.175
l thought she did good

01:32:47.218 --> 01:32:51.052
A Private Dance By James Smith The Crave Club

01:33:02.867 --> 01:33:06.963
l didn't know about the audition until afterwards

01:33:10.275 --> 01:33:12.436
Do you like my nails?

01:33:24.122 --> 01:33:26.317
They're not as nice as yours

01:33:31.362 --> 01:33:33.887
Maybe l'll help you with yours sometime

01:33:38.703 --> 01:33:40.603
lf you want

01:33:43.608 --> 01:33:46.509
lsn't that nice of you, darling?

01:33:46.878 --> 01:33:48.812
What are friends for?

01:33:56.721 --> 01:33:58.621
On second thought...

01:34:00.425 --> 01:34:03.223
maybe you shouldn't do mine

01:34:04.662 --> 01:34:08.598
l'm getting too old for that whory look

01:34:09.768 --> 01:34:11.702
l'll think about it

01:34:15.106 --> 01:34:17.404
Close the door on your way out

01:35:12.597 --> 01:35:14.758
Hey, bring on the real dancers!

01:35:17.202 --> 01:35:18.829
Boo!

01:35:19.938 --> 01:35:21.667
You suck!

01:35:25.043 --> 01:35:26.601
Get off the stage!

01:35:27.579 --> 01:35:29.979
Enough of this stuff!

01:35:30.381 --> 01:35:32.110
Let's dance!

01:35:43.328 --> 01:35:46.695
l loved it! lt was good

01:35:46.764 --> 01:35:48.698
What are you doing here, slumming?

01:35:48.766 --> 01:35:50.131
Heather!

01:35:51.970 --> 01:35:52.937
Were we good?

01:35:53.037 --> 01:35:53.935
Great

01:35:54.272 --> 01:35:55.569
She dances like a truck!

01:35:56.341 --> 01:35:59.844
l do not! Do you want something to drink?

01:35:59.844 --> 01:36:01.209
Yeah. Get me a beer, bitch

01:36:03.281 --> 01:36:04.748
Look what l got

01:36:07.418 --> 01:36:08.544
lt's beautiful

01:36:08.853 --> 01:36:10.343
l stole it from my grandmother

01:36:10.822 --> 01:36:13.848
You did not! You got it at a pawnshop

01:36:22.767 --> 01:36:24.200
We're getting married

01:36:27.372 --> 01:36:28.566
You love her?

01:36:29.874 --> 01:36:32.536
l don't know. She's having a baby

01:36:37.382 --> 01:36:38.542
And this?

01:36:39.684 --> 01:36:44.144
We ain't any good. You heard them. ''Get off the stage!''

01:36:46.124 --> 01:36:47.216
What will you do?

01:36:49.127 --> 01:36:52.824
Work in a grocery store Her mother owns it

01:36:53.798 --> 01:36:56.858
We'll get a discount on baby food

01:37:08.212 --> 01:37:09.474
See ya

01:37:13.351 --> 01:37:18.311
Shit happens, you know? Life sucks. l'm a student of T-shirts!

01:37:29.567 --> 01:37:31.034
Hey, Nicky

01:37:40.278 --> 01:37:41.643
Dear Ms. Malone,

01:37:41.746 --> 01:37:46.046
We regret we are unable to offer you...understudy

01:37:58.696 --> 01:37:59.964
You can't go in there!

01:37:59.964 --> 01:38:00.862
What's going on?

01:38:01.265 --> 01:38:02.664
What's going on?!

01:38:02.734 --> 01:38:05.066
Hey, cool it. Cool it?!

01:38:06.137 --> 01:38:07.764
When you sent me this?!

01:38:07.839 --> 01:38:10.672
She threatened to walk! She got her lawyers into it!

01:38:10.742 --> 01:38:11.800
So what?!

01:38:11.876 --> 01:38:14.174
So, she's a star! You're not worth it

01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:17.611
Sorry, Nomi. l tried. Fuck!

01:38:20.318 --> 01:38:25.017
Basically, my G-string snapped. There l was, dancing butt naked for 5 mins

01:38:25.390 --> 01:38:26.982
l mean, my poor partner!

01:38:29.727 --> 01:38:32.389
l thought about it, darling

01:38:34.232 --> 01:38:36.223
Think you could do my nails now?

01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:43.868
Okay

01:38:44.208 --> 01:38:45.800
Maybe some other time

01:40:57.441 --> 01:41:00.877
Come on...slave girl

01:41:04.682 --> 01:41:06.445

Cristal, can you hear me?

01:41:28.039 --> 01:41:29.904
Somebody get Marty!

01:41:34.912 --> 01:41:36.140
What happened? l don't know

01:41:37.081 --> 01:41:38.446
Somebody get an ambulance!

01:41:39.050 --> 01:41:40.312
Who was behind her?

01:41:40.751 --> 01:41:41.547
l was

01:41:42.620 --> 01:41:43.587
What happened?

01:41:45.122 --> 01:41:47.682
l don't know. She just went down

01:41:48.793 --> 01:41:51.284
She slipped. l saw it

01:41:53.197 --> 01:41:55.358
Nomi wasn't even close to her

01:42:13.117 --> 01:42:14.414
Tough break, huh?

01:42:17.688 --> 01:42:18.746
What's wrong?

01:42:19.123 --> 01:42:20.385
Nothing

01:42:40.778 --> 01:42:43.406
Thanks. Keep me informed

01:42:44.649 --> 01:42:47.550
She has a concussion. That'll be all right

01:42:47.918 --> 01:42:50.318
But she has a compound fracture of the hip

01:42:51.022 --> 01:42:52.990
Those take forever to heal

01:42:54.392 --> 01:42:55.654
We have to shut down

01:42:56.060 --> 01:42:58.995
Not a chance. The show goes on

01:42:59.463 --> 01:43:02.796
The Stardust is never dark. lt has never been

01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:05.668
lt never will be. Not while l am alive

01:43:07.038 --> 01:43:08.300
Who was her understudy?

01:43:09.507 --> 01:43:11.099
We had a girl who...

01:43:12.143 --> 01:43:13.405
What's funny?

01:43:13.477 --> 01:43:17.675
Cristal Connors is a star, Sam! You can't just replace her

01:43:22.787 --> 01:43:26.018
We could bring someone in while she's out

01:43:26.090 --> 01:43:27.455
She could be out for a year

01:43:27.525 --> 01:43:28.719
Like who?

01:43:29.093 --> 01:43:31.220
Janet Jackson. Paula Abdul

01:43:31.329 --> 01:43:32.796
Paula Abdul? ln my show?

01:43:32.863 --> 01:43:35.855
We're not paying those kind of salaries

01:43:35.966 --> 01:43:39.959
ln that case, Mr. Karlman, we do what we do in Vegas

01:43:41.739 --> 01:43:43.331
We gamble

01:43:46.143 --> 01:43:47.906
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:43:47.978 --> 01:43:52.938
the Stardust proudly presents Miss Nomi Malone

01:44:59.650 --> 01:45:01.447
We could have hired anyone

01:45:01.552 --> 01:45:03.577
Janet Jackson, Paula Abdul

01:45:04.021 --> 01:45:07.889
Nomi Malone is what Las Vegas is all about

01:45:07.958 --> 01:45:10.449
She's dazzling, she's exciting...

01:45:10.561 --> 01:45:14.088
...and very, very sexy. Thank you, Zack

01:45:14.999 --> 01:45:16.728
How did you feel about the show tonight?

01:45:18.536 --> 01:45:20.970

01:46:11.288 --> 01:46:13.848

Where are the police? They're not here

01:52:45.883 --> 01:52:48.511
Why not? Because they're not coming!

01:52:52.489 --> 01:52:54.047
Don't do it...

01:52:54.124 --> 01:52:55.113
Polly

01:53:03.533 --> 01:53:05.228
How did you find out?

01:53:05.602 --> 01:53:08.469
You were busted at a fight at the Crave Club

01:53:08.572 --> 01:53:10.199
The police took your fingerprints

01:53:11.875 --> 01:53:12.967

01:53:13.043 --> 01:53:15.102
Yes, you will!

01:53:18.015 --> 01:53:20.074
You're Polly Ann Costello!

01:53:20.150 --> 01:53:22.414
Your father killed your mother, then killed himself!

01:53:23.287 --> 01:53:26.620
You ran away from a foster home in Oakland in 1990!

01:53:26.690 --> 01:53:29.386
Arrests: Denver, soliciting... Stop it!

01:53:29.459 --> 01:53:33.395
San Jose, Cheyenne, soliciting! Shall l read the rest?

01:53:33.463 --> 01:53:37.866
Possession of crack cocaine! Assault with a deadly weapon!

01:53:39.403 --> 01:53:42.668
Tell me something. Why did you stop hooking?

01:53:43.073 --> 01:53:46.099
You had your future pretty well mapped out

01:53:48.178 --> 01:53:49.770
l did what l had to do

01:53:50.914 --> 01:53:52.905
Just like you did with Cristal

01:53:55.752 --> 01:53:57.310
l'm not a whore

01:53:59.489 --> 01:54:02.947
No...you're not

01:54:04.528 --> 01:54:06.621
You're going to be a big star

01:54:08.198 --> 01:54:10.666
Your face will be up on billboards

01:54:11.468 --> 01:54:15.097
And you will make a lot of money for the Stardust

01:54:30.721 --> 01:54:33.087
You'd let him get away with this?

01:54:33.623 --> 01:54:36.091
Andrew Carver is at the Paradiso this year

01:54:36.393 --> 01:54:39.294
He might be at the Stardust next year

01:54:39.363 --> 01:54:41.661
He's part of the team. So are you

01:54:45.235 --> 01:54:46.793
What about Molly?

01:54:47.471 --> 01:54:51.134
l'll see he gives her enough money to have a dress shop

01:54:54.778 --> 01:54:56.040
Tell me something

01:54:57.814 --> 01:54:59.475
What did you charge?

01:55:01.551 --> 01:55:03.212
Hooking

01:55:07.591 --> 01:55:10.958
Fifty. A hundred sometimes

01:55:12.562 --> 01:55:16.328
You got low self-esteem, baby. You're a fantastic fuck

01:55:26.410 --> 01:55:28.537

You make a sound, l'll fucking kill you!

01:58:02.465 --> 01:58:04.228
Okay, okay

01:58:19.015 --> 01:58:21.779
Fucker! Fuck off!

01:58:33.330 --> 01:58:34.922
He says he wants to sleep

01:58:35.265 --> 01:58:37.256
Tired him out, huh?

01:58:54.818 --> 01:58:57.616
She's still out. lt's the medication

01:58:59.789 --> 01:59:01.017

coming down the stairs after you

02:00:41.858 --> 02:00:43.758
