WEBVTT

00:03.919 --> 00:06.754
 good morning, USA! 

00:06.822 --> 00:10.625
 I got a feeling that it's
gonna be a wonderful day 

00:10.693 --> 00:13.561
 the sun in the sky has
a smile on his face 

00:13.629 --> 00:17.765
 and he's shining a salute
to the American race 

00:19.868 --> 00:23.304
 oh, boy, it's swell to say 

00:23.372 --> 00:25.206
 good...  good morning, USA 

00:25.274 --> 00:26.841
Aah!

00:26.909 --> 00:31.379
Sync by honeybunny

00:33.649 --> 00:36.050
Ah, damn it!

00:36.118 --> 00:39.020
This country's gone to hell
since the democrats took over.

00:39.088 --> 00:41.456
They just throw money at
anyone who asks for help.

00:41.524 --> 00:43.224
I know, it's wonderful!

00:43.292 --> 00:44.926
Name's Fantasia Lopez.

00:44.994 --> 00:47.695
I'm on my way to welfare
to get some free stuff.

00:47.763 --> 00:49.364
Don't you worry, babies.

00:49.432 --> 00:51.032
Momma's gonna get some food stamps

00:51.100 --> 00:54.035
So you can get the milk duds you need.

00:54.103 --> 00:56.738
Look, Roger's clearly taking advantage,

00:56.806 --> 00:58.606
But social programs are important.

00:58.674 --> 01:00.341
Social programs are a crutch.

01:00.409 --> 01:03.044
Bailing out people too
weak to help themselves.

01:03.112 --> 01:04.813
good point, nose.

01:04.879 --> 01:07.482
You see, I have a cold,
but I'm going to work.

01:07.550 --> 01:08.750
I'm not crawling around the house

01:08.818 --> 01:11.853
Like David Hasselhoff
trying to eat a hamburger.

01:11.921 --> 01:13.988
hey, dad, before you leave,

01:14.056 --> 01:15.924
Can you help me with my homework? No!

01:15.991 --> 01:17.292
Everyone asking for help.

01:17.359 --> 01:19.260
Don't study things you can't grasp!

01:19.328 --> 01:20.895
Honey, I'm late for the supermarket.

01:20.963 --> 01:22.230
Can you get my zipper? No!

01:22.298 --> 01:24.466
Don't wear clothes you can't manage!

01:26.035 --> 01:27.235
She's choking!

01:27.303 --> 01:28.703
Dad, do something! No!

01:28.771 --> 01:30.138
Don't eat food you can't handle.

01:30.206 --> 01:31.539
Do not help her, Francine.

01:31.607 --> 01:34.175
Come on, Hayley,
you can get yourself out of this.

01:39.315 --> 01:41.583
See, she saved her own life.

01:41.650 --> 01:42.884
Oh, three-second rule.

01:42.952 --> 01:46.087
Ugh, Hayley, you know I
don't like turkey sausage.

01:46.155 --> 01:47.822
Why'd you give me this?

01:48.858 --> 01:50.425
Oh, thank you, Greg.

01:50.493 --> 01:51.392
Why don't you come in for a bit?

01:51.460 --> 01:52.627
We're having mimosas.

01:52.695 --> 01:54.696
On a Monday? What's the occasion?

01:54.763 --> 01:56.197
We always have brunch.

01:56.265 --> 01:58.366
It's the most important gay meal of the day.

01:58.434 --> 02:00.468
It's the only meal of the day for me.

02:00.536 --> 02:02.136
I'm gay fat.

02:02.204 --> 02:04.439
I'm straight thin, but I'm gay fat.

02:07.243 --> 02:09.911
Next, we pull back the muscle flaps.

02:09.979 --> 02:11.446
I-I can't do it.

02:11.514 --> 02:14.249
Oh, come on, he's a friendly guy!

02:14.316 --> 02:15.683
 hello, my baby 

02:15.751 --> 02:17.018
 hello, my honey 

02:17.086 --> 02:18.753
 hello, my ragtime gal. 

02:21.657 --> 02:23.625
You are so cute!

02:23.692 --> 02:25.660
We should hang out some time after school.

02:25.728 --> 02:27.462
Listen, I'll say this for your own good

02:27.530 --> 02:28.563
'cause you're new here.

02:28.631 --> 02:29.797
I'm a nerd.

02:29.865 --> 02:30.999
I know.

02:31.066 --> 02:33.134
Nerds are kind of my thing.

02:33.202 --> 02:36.504
If you think that was nerdy,
check this!

02:36.572 --> 02:38.172
 when the pimp's in the crib, ma 

02:38.240 --> 02:40.441
 hop it like it's hot,
hop it like it's hot 

02:40.509 --> 02:41.843
 hop it like it's hot 

02:41.911 --> 02:45.179
Snoop froggy frog.

02:45.247 --> 02:46.314
You're still on board, right?

02:49.018 --> 02:50.885
You sure you won't have one more?

02:50.953 --> 02:53.988
Thanks, but I'm a bit tipsy as it is.

02:54.056 --> 02:55.423
It's bad enough I peed in your shower.

02:55.491 --> 02:57.325
Bye!

02:57.393 --> 02:59.928
Oh... What did she just say?

02:59.995 --> 03:02.130
Hiya, Francine!

03:02.197 --> 03:03.831
You should move your car.

03:03.899 --> 03:05.667
It's street cleaning today.

03:05.734 --> 03:07.669
Oh, thank you, al.

03:15.411 --> 03:19.013
I'm afraid that was an illegal
u-turn, ma'am.

03:19.081 --> 03:21.449
Oh, come on, I live right there.

03:21.517 --> 03:24.319
Can't you just give me a break, pig?

03:24.386 --> 03:26.821
That is not my name, ma'am.

03:28.424 --> 03:32.860
oh, forgive me, officer Figpucker.

03:32.928 --> 03:35.463
I... I'm drunk is all.

03:38.167 --> 03:39.467
Francine!

03:39.535 --> 03:40.868
Oh, Stan, thank god.

03:40.936 --> 03:42.470
Did you pay my bail yet?

03:42.538 --> 03:43.671
Oh, no.

03:43.739 --> 03:44.939
I just came to visit.

03:45.007 --> 03:46.541
You know I don't believe
in bailing people out.

03:46.609 --> 03:49.143
So, have you traded bras
with your cellmate yet?

03:49.211 --> 03:51.245
What? Like at summer camp.

03:51.313 --> 03:53.214
You think girls trade bras at summer camp?

03:53.282 --> 03:54.616
I would.

03:54.683 --> 03:56.684
I'd get rid of my ratty old beige bras

03:56.752 --> 03:58.286
And trade up for something lacey.

03:58.354 --> 04:02.724
Stan, listen, it's okay for
people to ask for help.

04:02.791 --> 04:05.159
Like when they're in a drunk tank

04:05.227 --> 04:07.829
With a guy who calls himself "Mr.
Businessman."

04:07.896 --> 04:10.932
I'm wearing a suit, you see.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.500
Francine, I'm sorry,

04:12.568 --> 04:14.202
But you need to get
yourself out of this mess.

04:15.804 --> 04:18.206
Now, I've got to go home and
nurse this cold with some soup.

04:18.273 --> 04:20.642
 chunky beef. 

04:24.113 --> 04:26.014
Want me to be your husband?

04:27.149 --> 04:29.584
You're right to make me earn it.

04:37.726 --> 04:40.094
There's our little jailbird now.

04:40.162 --> 04:42.030
See, she got out all by herself,

04:42.097 --> 04:44.565
And I bet she's a better
person for the experience.

04:44.633 --> 04:47.335
They branded me with a shamrock, stan.

04:47.403 --> 04:51.606
I'm a member of the Aryan lassies now.

04:51.674 --> 04:53.241
So, mom, how'd you get out of jail?

04:53.308 --> 04:55.143
Well, I went before the judge,

04:55.210 --> 04:57.779
And she sentenced me to community service.

04:57.846 --> 04:59.847
So, I'm working at a soup
kitchen starting today.

04:59.915 --> 05:01.249
Soup kitchen?

05:01.316 --> 05:03.785
No, no, no, it's wrong
to feed starving people.

05:03.852 --> 05:05.086
It takes away their motivation.

05:05.154 --> 05:07.455
The system works!

05:07.523 --> 05:09.390
I need to be over there.

05:11.727 --> 05:13.961
I'm gonna keep swinging my baby lasso

05:14.029 --> 05:16.030
Till I catch me a man.

05:19.668 --> 05:21.502
Out of my way, bums.

05:21.570 --> 05:22.804
Stan?

05:22.871 --> 05:24.906
This is the soup my wife
is serving for dinner.

05:24.973 --> 05:26.274
That makes it my dinner.

05:26.341 --> 05:28.443
This is my soup.

05:28.510 --> 05:29.777
You'll have to find something else to spill

05:29.845 --> 05:32.380
On the outermost of your five coats.

05:35.451 --> 05:37.952
Looks like a whole lot of soup.

05:38.020 --> 05:39.954
Who are you, the damn soup police?

05:40.022 --> 05:41.456
I deserved that.

05:41.523 --> 05:43.658
No, I'm sorry, I'm,
I'm just trying to nurse this cold.

05:43.726 --> 05:46.861
You know, I'm in the
pharmaceutical business.

05:46.929 --> 05:49.664
I might have something
that'll make you feel better.

05:53.402 --> 05:56.337
This'll clear you right up.

05:57.806 --> 06:00.007
I see, it's some sort of heated inhalant.

06:02.000 --> 06:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:09.985 --> 06:11.819
Wow, you're right, I feel great!

06:11.887 --> 06:13.354
Whoo!

06:13.422 --> 06:15.556
Any chance I could get some
of that cold medicine to go?

06:15.624 --> 06:17.191
Sure thing.

06:17.259 --> 06:18.960
No need, pal.

06:19.027 --> 06:20.461
First time's free.

06:20.529 --> 06:21.696
Whoo!

06:21.764 --> 06:23.097
I feel strong enough to drag a mattress

06:23.165 --> 06:25.032
Into an abandoned building!

06:26.735 --> 06:28.803
Hey, as long as you're giving out crack,

06:28.871 --> 06:30.938
How about you throw a little din
g-a-dong-ding-ding

06:31.006 --> 06:33.274
Old crackhead booboo's way?

06:33.342 --> 06:35.376
Not now, mom, I'm working.

06:39.086 --> 06:40.653
No, it's not crazy.

06:40.721 --> 06:42.622
What else would girls be doing at camp?

06:42.690 --> 06:46.593
Okay, everyone, it's time
for the CIA obstacle course.

06:48.362 --> 06:50.964
Once outside, you'll navigate every obstacle

06:51.031 --> 06:53.566
You'll encounter in the
field in Afghanistan.

06:53.634 --> 06:55.235
I set it up while you were at lunch.

06:55.302 --> 06:56.436
You rascal!

06:56.504 --> 06:59.105
You said you had paperwork to go over.

06:59.173 --> 07:01.608
I know! hot dog!

07:03.177 --> 07:04.878
Hmm, don't want this cold

07:04.945 --> 07:06.746
Getting in the way of my performance.

07:09.250 --> 07:11.885
On your mark, get set, go!

07:13.220 --> 07:15.488
Whoo! Yeah!

07:20.361 --> 07:21.561
Whoo!

07:21.629 --> 07:23.530
The typical Afghani market bazaar

07:23.597 --> 07:25.798
Has hidden dangers everywhere.

07:28.068 --> 07:30.036
The stitching is fantastic.

07:30.104 --> 07:31.504
This would really look great...

07:34.041 --> 07:35.942
He likes you, picture?

07:39.747 --> 07:41.447
Stan : Yeah!

07:53.961 --> 07:55.361
Good work, smith.

07:55.429 --> 07:57.263
Whatever you're doing, keep it up.

07:57.331 --> 07:59.699
Look what you've done!

07:59.767 --> 08:00.934
She was my pet!

08:01.001 --> 08:02.468
Her name was hot sauce,

08:02.536 --> 08:04.203
And I loved her!

08:04.271 --> 08:06.973
I hope someone breaks your neck one day,
you murderer!

08:08.375 --> 08:10.543
Yeesh. I know, right?

08:12.680 --> 08:15.748
Let's see, I couldn't use the "f,
" so I subtract three points.

08:15.816 --> 08:17.884
I know something you can use the "f" for.

08:17.952 --> 08:19.185
Oh, my!

08:19.253 --> 08:20.720
You kids having a good time?

08:20.788 --> 08:22.488
hello, sir.

08:22.556 --> 08:23.923
Lovely day, is it not?

08:23.991 --> 08:25.959
Will you excuse us, Jeanine?

08:28.495 --> 08:29.829
Mr. Winthrop,

08:29.897 --> 08:31.130
I wasn't trying anything, I swear.

08:31.198 --> 08:32.932
That's a pity; Jeanine likes you.

08:33.000 --> 08:33.933
Uh, what?

08:34.001 --> 08:35.902
Steve, I understand young love.

08:35.970 --> 08:38.471
My daughter wants to be with you intimately,

08:38.539 --> 08:40.807
And I'm here to tell you
that you have my blessing.

08:40.874 --> 08:42.275
Oh, god, I'm gonna pass out.

08:42.342 --> 08:45.211
If you and my daughter
get physical, I only ask

08:45.279 --> 08:48.147
That you do it safely, under my roof.

08:48.215 --> 08:50.116
Okay. Jeanine?

08:50.184 --> 08:51.784
Jeanine?!

08:51.852 --> 08:54.354
Of course, I'll have to
meet your parents first.

08:55.322 --> 08:56.689
I'll organize a dinner

08:56.757 --> 08:58.257
For our families in a few days.

08:58.325 --> 09:00.460
And son?

09:01.695 --> 09:03.096
Safety first.

09:03.163 --> 09:05.798
And don't worry about the sheets.

09:05.866 --> 09:07.634
She's ridden horses her whole life.

09:15.442 --> 09:16.609
Whew!

09:16.677 --> 09:18.344
Clears my sinuses right up!

09:18.412 --> 09:20.446
You gonna share that crack
you're doing or what?

09:20.514 --> 09:22.348
Crack? This is cold medicine.

09:22.416 --> 09:23.816
No, sir, it's crack.

09:23.884 --> 09:25.284
It's not crack!

09:25.352 --> 09:27.620
I bought it on a park bench
outside a soup kitchen

09:27.688 --> 09:30.523
From a guy in a lime-green suit-- oh,
my god, it's crack.

09:30.591 --> 09:31.858
Oh, my god!

09:31.925 --> 09:33.326
CIA agents are supposed to

09:33.394 --> 09:35.361
Distribute crack to the inner-city,
not smoke it!

09:35.429 --> 09:37.063
Okay, this is okay.

09:37.131 --> 09:38.998
Easy mistake; anyone could make it.

09:39.066 --> 09:40.933
I'll throw this away and forget about it.

09:41.001 --> 09:42.268
This is just between us, roger, all right?

09:42.336 --> 09:43.269
It will never happen again.

09:44.672 --> 09:46.239
Never again.

09:46.306 --> 09:48.641
That's what I say every time
I wear the plunger penis.

09:53.313 --> 09:56.549
Ahh! I said I wouldn't do this again!

10:01.188 --> 10:04.123
I wish I was dead.

10:04.191 --> 10:05.725
Anyone else wish they were dead?

10:05.793 --> 10:07.560
Uh, I don't.

10:07.628 --> 10:08.961
So, there's this girl I like,

10:09.029 --> 10:10.296
And her father wants our families

10:10.364 --> 10:11.698
To have dinner together.

10:11.765 --> 10:14.400
Oh, Steve, your voice is
so annoying sometimes.

10:19.940 --> 10:21.974
Look, forget it, it's just this damn cold.

10:22.042 --> 10:23.876
It's making me cranky. You know, Stan,

10:23.944 --> 10:27.013
Sometimes people need help
getting over their colds.

10:27.081 --> 10:28.448
I don't need any help; I'm fine.

10:28.515 --> 10:30.950
Now, let's just all try
and enjoy our dinner.

10:54.007 --> 10:55.708
I'm going to go take out the trash.

10:55.776 --> 10:57.443
There he goes.

10:57.511 --> 10:59.378
All right, I didn't want to do this.

10:59.446 --> 11:01.380
Plunger boobies!

11:01.448 --> 11:02.615
Oh, my god!

11:02.683 --> 11:03.883
Could you imagine

11:03.951 --> 11:05.852
If I really had nips like these?

11:05.919 --> 11:08.855
I'd like to think I'd find love.

11:08.922 --> 11:12.125
Announcer : Do you sometimes feel
irritable?

11:12.192 --> 11:14.127
Restless? Uneasy? Sad?

11:14.194 --> 11:16.462
Normal? Or just plain not high?

11:16.530 --> 11:19.031
Maybe it's time to try crack.

11:19.099 --> 11:20.867
 ¶

11:26.373 --> 11:27.340
Crack may cause shivers.

11:27.407 --> 11:29.575
Night terrors, gay for pay,

11:29.643 --> 11:31.644
Heart palpitations,
homicidal paranoia,

11:31.712 --> 11:33.780
Or the sensation that you're on fire.

11:33.847 --> 11:35.615
Peeing blood and seeing
friends' faces

11:35.682 --> 11:38.050
As talking skeletons are possible
side effects of crack.

11:38.118 --> 11:39.986
People who use crack may
also experience

11:40.053 --> 11:43.189
Five to seven years in prison where brutal
raping may occur.

11:43.257 --> 11:44.924
If you experience one or more of these side
effects,

11:44.992 --> 11:46.192
Consult your dealer.

11:46.260 --> 11:47.360
You may need more crack.

11:47.427 --> 11:48.995
Crack.

11:49.062 --> 11:51.597
Isn't it time you see what all the fuss is
about?

11:58.806 --> 11:59.906
Why does oprah like this one?

11:59.973 --> 12:01.174
It's so boring.

12:01.241 --> 12:02.408
Shh!

12:02.476 --> 12:03.843
Are you crazy?!

12:03.911 --> 12:05.545
You can't speak ill of Oprah.

12:05.612 --> 12:07.313
Val Kilmer bad-mouthed Oprah,

12:07.381 --> 12:10.283
And now he's slowly turning into a pumpkin!

12:10.350 --> 12:12.351
Stan, where have you been?

12:12.419 --> 12:14.387
I haven't seen you in three days.

12:14.454 --> 12:16.289
It feels that way because
we love each other.

12:16.356 --> 12:18.124
No, it's been three days.

12:18.192 --> 12:19.525
We need to talk.

12:19.593 --> 12:22.695
My ATM card was rejected
for insufficient funds,

12:22.763 --> 12:25.598
My necklace is missing, the TV is gone.

12:25.666 --> 12:26.833
No, it's not. It's right there.

12:26.900 --> 12:29.602
I don't think that's the TV, Stan.

12:29.670 --> 12:31.270
Sure it is. It's just not plugged in.

12:31.338 --> 12:33.272
Hey, wasn't your aunt Beverly
buried with her jewellery?

12:33.340 --> 12:35.208
I want to go pay my respects.
Where was she buried?

12:35.275 --> 12:37.210
ooh, oh, diarrhoea.

12:37.277 --> 12:38.644
Oh, good. Dad's home.

12:38.712 --> 12:40.046
Now, don't forget,

12:40.113 --> 12:41.714
Tonight is our dinner at Jeanine's house.

12:41.782 --> 12:43.482
Roger's coming as my uncle Cosworth.

12:43.550 --> 12:45.518
Land the ho, matey!

12:45.586 --> 12:46.719
No, roger.

12:46.787 --> 12:48.621
I need everything to go perfect tonight.

12:48.689 --> 12:50.423
Of course it will, honey.

12:50.490 --> 12:52.358
Now help me fix the tv.

12:57.130 --> 12:58.965
I don't think this is right.

13:01.535 --> 13:03.469
We like to finish the tour

13:03.537 --> 13:06.138
With our family's most cherished possession.

13:06.206 --> 13:08.608
A priceless fabergé egg.

13:10.477 --> 13:12.778
 ¶

13:15.616 --> 13:18.050
Steve, your family is charming.

13:18.118 --> 13:19.752
Next time you're down at the marina,

13:19.820 --> 13:22.021
I'll let you hop on my 28 footer.

13:22.089 --> 13:23.990
Also, you should take a
spin on my boat. Ooh!

13:26.159 --> 13:27.894
Um, could you excuse me for a second?

13:29.563 --> 13:31.597
You guys mind if I steer the conversation

13:31.665 --> 13:33.633
To a little tech talk?

13:33.700 --> 13:35.668
Does your TV have insides?

13:36.770 --> 13:38.704
What am I supposed to do with that?

13:38.772 --> 13:40.640
Come back with cash and we'll do business.

13:42.876 --> 13:45.311
So, I'm huddled there with my eyes closed.

13:45.379 --> 13:48.214
I feel the bear's wet nose on my cheek.

13:48.282 --> 13:50.182
Sorry about that.

13:50.250 --> 13:51.784
Gotta find a way to make
some quick cash.

13:57.090 --> 13:59.592
 ¶

13:59.660 --> 14:01.294
So, with the black bear, I wasn't sure

14:01.361 --> 14:02.628
If you're supposed to make yourself look

14:02.696 --> 14:04.096
As big as possible or as...

14:04.164 --> 14:05.464
hey!

14:05.532 --> 14:06.899
20 bucks, I'll make you see heaven.

14:06.967 --> 14:08.868
Stan, what the hell are you doing?

14:08.936 --> 14:10.770
Yeah, dad, what is wrong with you?

14:10.837 --> 14:11.938
Isn't it obvious?

14:12.005 --> 14:13.272
Guy can't handle his crack.

14:14.174 --> 14:15.341
Ten bucks.

14:15.409 --> 14:16.375
Ten bucks and you can slap me with it.

14:16.443 --> 14:17.677
What?

14:17.744 --> 14:19.211
Stan, you're on crack?!

14:19.279 --> 14:20.546
No! No!

14:20.614 --> 14:22.248
I will be as soon as this pervert pays me.

14:22.316 --> 14:24.250
Get out of my house.

14:24.318 --> 14:26.218
No! Sir, please!

14:26.286 --> 14:29.121
I'm sorry it didn't work out, son.

14:32.726 --> 14:34.593
Honey, point them to the door.

14:34.661 --> 14:36.595
First you go down that hallway,

14:36.663 --> 14:38.464
And then you take a left.

14:48.963 --> 14:50.531
Stan, we need to talk.

14:50.799 --> 14:52.600
We're here because we love you.

14:52.667 --> 14:54.001
I'll go first.

14:54.069 --> 14:56.570
Stan, do you have any
idea how dangerous it is

14:56.638 --> 14:58.305
To go down town and buy crack?

14:58.373 --> 15:00.341
You could've bought from me,
right here in the house.

15:00.408 --> 15:02.109
Roger, you're not being helpful.

15:02.177 --> 15:03.777
Did you really expect me to be?

15:03.845 --> 15:06.780
We're here to talk about your drug problem.

15:06.848 --> 15:08.482
It's hurting the family.

15:08.550 --> 15:10.284
I had a sure thing, old man!

15:11.520 --> 15:13.687
Dad, you have a problem, and you need help.

15:15.824 --> 15:17.191
You're right.

15:17.259 --> 15:18.626
I have a crack addiction.

15:18.693 --> 15:21.362
And I've been stealing from
all of you to support it.

15:21.429 --> 15:23.697
I took the TV and Francine's jewellery.

15:23.765 --> 15:26.133
Roger, I stole about eight of your wigs.

15:26.201 --> 15:28.169
But those were just to
wear while I was high.

15:28.236 --> 15:30.704
Super fun to walk around high in a wig.

15:32.774 --> 15:35.609
But my family shouldn't
have to pay the price.

15:35.677 --> 15:37.711
I realize that now.

15:37.779 --> 15:39.947
And I'm going to kick this thing, I swear.

15:40.015 --> 15:41.916
Oh, thank god!

15:41.983 --> 15:43.817
Now we can get you the help you need.

15:43.885 --> 15:45.152
No!

15:45.220 --> 15:47.955
Stan smith doesn't take help from anyone!

15:48.023 --> 15:50.791
I got myself into this, I'll get myself out.

15:53.328 --> 15:55.262
while we're all here,

15:55.330 --> 15:57.798
I think I'm addicted to pot.

15:57.866 --> 15:59.700
Don't be ridiculous.

16:00.902 --> 16:02.369
Okay, roger.

16:02.437 --> 16:05.739
For the next 48 hours,
your attic is my withdrawal pod.

16:05.807 --> 16:07.641
I'm doing this on my own.
No help from anyone.

16:07.709 --> 16:09.210
Don't let anyone in,

16:09.277 --> 16:10.811
And whatever I say,

16:10.879 --> 16:12.780
Don't open the door. Got it.

16:12.847 --> 16:15.015
You've got the room for
as long as you need it.

16:15.083 --> 16:17.518
Good luck, friend.

16:23.658 --> 16:25.526
I forgot my comb. I need crack!

16:28.096 --> 16:29.930
Why do I need a comb?

16:33.835 --> 16:35.202
Intruders!

16:39.374 --> 16:42.042
What are you doing with
my local daytime emmy?

16:42.110 --> 16:44.278
I-I-I need to pawn it for cash.

16:44.346 --> 16:46.046
You can't; it's priceless.
You can't; it's worthless.

16:47.449 --> 16:48.882
We have the place surrounded!

16:48.950 --> 16:50.417
Come out with your hands up!

16:50.485 --> 16:52.386
So you can force me into rehab? No dice.

16:52.454 --> 16:54.688
Now, let me go,
or I'll kill the gay news team!

16:56.191 --> 16:57.925
You can just say news team.

17:03.331 --> 17:05.232
Malcolm Hathaway.

17:05.300 --> 17:06.733
Hostage negotiator.

17:06.800 --> 17:08.068
I'll take it from here.

17:08.136 --> 17:10.237
Don't worry, ma'am, I'm the best there is.

17:10.305 --> 17:12.406
We're going to get your
husband out of there.

17:15.510 --> 17:16.542
Hello?

17:16.611 --> 17:18.212
Stan, it's Malcolm Hathaway,

17:18.280 --> 17:19.680
Hostage negotiator.

17:19.748 --> 17:21.080
I just want to talk.

17:21.148 --> 17:22.383
I don't have anything to say!

17:23.785 --> 17:25.786
Get him $50,000 in unmarked bills.

17:25.854 --> 17:28.122
Sir, he didn't ask for money.

17:28.189 --> 17:31.091
Then make it 500,000!

17:31.159 --> 17:33.027
I don't think this guy's very good.

17:33.094 --> 17:34.261
You know what I'm good at?

17:34.329 --> 17:36.230
Cartwheels! Watch!

17:39.167 --> 17:41.101
Stan : Hello? Are you still there?

17:41.169 --> 17:43.604
oh, this game.

17:43.672 --> 17:46.073
Fine, I'll get you a plane to Colombia.

17:46.141 --> 17:47.508
Cocaine is dirt cheap there.

17:47.575 --> 17:49.610
That... That sounds good.

17:49.678 --> 17:51.145
It's on its way.

17:51.212 --> 17:53.147
As a gesture of goodwill,

17:53.214 --> 17:54.882
I'm going to give you another hostage.

17:54.949 --> 17:56.784
Send in the boy.

18:03.091 --> 18:06.026
Well, this is getting interesting.

18:06.094 --> 18:08.862
I bought this chair for my eclipse party.

18:08.930 --> 18:10.597
The only one who showed up was Tuttle.

18:10.665 --> 18:12.433
I thought it was an éclair party.

18:12.500 --> 18:14.735
You don't listen!

18:23.011 --> 18:24.845
Okay, Mr. Smith, just get on the plane

18:24.913 --> 18:26.747
And get the hell out of here.

18:29.851 --> 18:31.819
Stan, don't go!

18:31.886 --> 18:33.754
We love you! Let us help you!

18:33.822 --> 18:35.756
I told you I don't need help!

18:35.824 --> 18:37.424
I need crack!

18:37.492 --> 18:38.726
Now, where's the fly button?

18:38.793 --> 18:39.993
Oh, here it is.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.201
Okay, the newscasters are clear.

18:47.268 --> 18:48.569
Take your shot! What?

18:48.636 --> 18:50.270
But they're... Take your shot!

18:50.338 --> 18:51.739
Greg!

18:52.807 --> 18:55.008
I don't know about you,

18:55.076 --> 18:58.512
But I sure would like a slice
of pie right about now.

19:00.482 --> 19:03.150
Yay!

19:12.093 --> 19:13.961
Finally.

19:14.028 --> 19:16.964
The majestic crack fields of Colombia.

19:17.031 --> 19:19.900
I can live like a king here
for the rest of my days.

19:22.170 --> 19:24.104
Crack?

19:24.172 --> 19:25.773
Can I... Can I have some crack?

19:25.840 --> 19:27.708
Just a little... Just a little crack.

19:27.776 --> 19:29.643
Give me your wallet! What? No!

19:29.711 --> 19:31.712
Give me your wallet! Get off me!
This is a mugging.

19:31.780 --> 19:33.414
I'm not giving you my wallet. Give it to me!

19:34.649 --> 19:36.617
Help me rob this white man.

19:36.684 --> 19:37.751
You're asking for help.

19:37.819 --> 19:39.386
That's so pathetic.

19:39.454 --> 19:41.388
You didn't kick. You need to kick.

19:42.824 --> 19:44.625
No, don't help him. It's a crutch.

19:44.692 --> 19:45.692
It'll make the kid weak.

19:45.760 --> 19:48.462
No! He needed our help and he asked.

19:48.530 --> 19:50.297
There is no shame in that.

19:50.365 --> 19:51.899
Shoes are very valuable.

19:51.966 --> 19:53.467
Never forget the shoes.

19:54.669 --> 19:57.571
Oh, and check his pocket.

19:57.639 --> 19:59.273
Look, plane keys!

19:59.340 --> 20:00.808
I did it!

20:00.875 --> 20:02.676
Thank you, everyone, thank you!

20:05.547 --> 20:07.448
Oh, my god!

20:07.515 --> 20:09.283
You helped him.

20:09.350 --> 20:11.985
And it didn't make him weaker.

20:12.053 --> 20:13.487
It made him a better thief.

20:21.629 --> 20:23.597
I need some soup.

20:23.665 --> 20:25.599
And some help.

20:25.667 --> 20:26.834
Stan!

20:26.901 --> 20:28.068
You were right.

20:28.136 --> 20:30.103
Everyone needs help sometimes.

20:30.171 --> 20:31.271
And that's okay.

20:31.339 --> 20:33.106
Oh, honey,

20:33.174 --> 20:35.576
We're going to get you
everything you need to kick this.

20:35.643 --> 20:38.011
I'm ready to change.

20:38.079 --> 20:41.081
Right after I smoke crack one more time!

20:46.788 --> 20:48.722
I did it!

20:48.790 --> 20:50.190
I kicked it for good!

20:50.258 --> 20:52.793
Oh, Stan, we missed you so much!

20:52.861 --> 20:54.161
Welcome back, dad.

20:54.229 --> 20:56.096
I will hate you until the day I die.

20:56.164 --> 20:57.364
Sure thing, kiddo.

20:57.432 --> 20:59.666
Camping sounds great.

21:01.769 --> 21:04.605
Mom, while we're here,

21:04.672 --> 21:07.407
I really think I should check
myself in for my pot problem.

21:07.475 --> 21:09.643
Just stop it, Hayley.
