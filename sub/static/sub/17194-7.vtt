00:02.480 --> 00:04.233
<i>So Benjamin kills himself</i>

00:04.240 --> 00:06.197
and admits to murdering
his father,

00:06.200 --> 00:07.680
<i>Alderman Stephen Bartlett.</i>

00:07.680 --> 00:08.830
This case isn't done.

00:08.840 --> 00:10.354
Welcome back to New York.

00:10.360 --> 00:13.751
Let's just say you
and I make great business partners.

00:13.760 --> 00:16.149
Sara, my darlin'.

00:16.160 --> 00:19.278
What exactly happened
to my boys?

00:19.280 --> 00:21.112
I carry another child?

00:21.120 --> 00:22.110
Yes.

01:21.760 --> 01:24.400
Well, excuse me,
sleeping beauty.

01:24.960 --> 01:27.520
<i>The precinct isn't a flophouse.</i>

01:27.920 --> 01:29.320
I know.

01:29.320 --> 01:32.836
Detective, go home to your wife.

01:33.960 --> 01:36.077
I'll choose where I go.

01:36.640 --> 01:38.359
And I'll choose when.

01:38.760 --> 01:41.275
This vagrancy has to end.

01:41.280 --> 01:43.192
So either you go home,
go to a cathouse,

01:43.200 --> 01:44.236
or sleep on the street,

01:44.240 --> 01:46.835
<i>like any normal
Five Points denizen.</i>

02:21.800 --> 02:23.598
Can I help you,
Missus?

02:27.240 --> 02:29.630
You're in
need, are ya?

02:39.600 --> 02:41.114
Thank you, momma.

02:41.280 --> 02:42.680
You're welcome.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.673
What are they on about now?

02:55.400 --> 02:56.754
<i>Nothing to cause concern.</i>

03:06.480 --> 03:08.676
Oh, that's just
street sweepers.

03:08.680 --> 03:09.875
I don't even know
why they bother,

03:09.880 --> 03:13.191
with these mountains
of filth.

03:13.200 --> 03:14.270
I know it's strikingly
different

03:14.280 --> 03:15.600
from life on the plantation,

03:15.600 --> 03:18.638
but Five Points
has its charms, too.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.153
Yesterday, we saw a naked child
jumping up and down

03:25.200 --> 03:27.920
on a pile of dead,
bloated horses.

03:29.160 --> 03:32.471
I don't even think
my Sara noticed.

03:37.680 --> 03:40.912
Doctor, my baby girl,
Hazel, is sick. Real sick.

03:40.920 --> 03:41.910
<i>What's wrong with her?</i>

03:41.920 --> 03:44.310
<i>Can't hold anything in...
same as all our neighbors.</i>

03:44.320 --> 03:45.470
Hot fever.

03:45.480 --> 03:47.756
It's been a few days now,
and I don't know what to do.

03:47.760 --> 03:48.955
<i>How many people are sick?</i>

03:48.960 --> 03:50.633
<i>It seems like half the block.</i>

03:50.640 --> 03:51.596
The hospital turned us away

03:51.600 --> 03:53.273
so they puttin'
all the stricken in a flat

03:53.280 --> 03:55.078
<i>on the second floor
of our building.</i>

03:57.320 --> 03:59.676
This could take
some time.

04:21.079 --> 04:23.470
What the hell are you doing
in here?

04:23.840 --> 04:26.355
Downstairs neighbor
complaining about a leak.

04:30.280 --> 04:31.555
Go on now,

04:31.560 --> 04:33.358
or I'll stick you
like the pig you are.

04:35.240 --> 04:37.880
Ah! All right.
All right.

04:41.880 --> 04:44.793
<i>The Board of Aldermen
vote should not be the problem.</i>

04:44.800 --> 04:48.191
<i>Being underbid on the project,
that is the danger.</i>

04:49.320 --> 04:50.720
Miss Heissen.

04:52.840 --> 04:55.514
Thank you for coming down
so early.

04:58.760 --> 05:01.832
Ah!
Woman with child first.

05:02.080 --> 05:03.594
I need your assistance.

05:03.600 --> 05:06.115
An especially vexing pest
has been thwarting my business,

05:06.120 --> 05:08.874
but I currently lack
the leverage I need

05:08.880 --> 05:09.597
to get rid of him.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.240
You, my dear,

05:12.240 --> 05:14.880
are the perfect fraulein
for the task.

05:14.880 --> 05:17.076
Go on.

05:17.080 --> 05:18.878
Fortuitously,
this individual is due

05:18.880 --> 05:20.837
to be visiting
your establishment.

05:20.840 --> 05:24.436
Fancies girls that remind him
of his time in the tropics.

05:24.440 --> 05:26.238
At any rate,
I would like your help

05:26.240 --> 05:30.234
putting him in a more...
Compliant position.

05:32.080 --> 05:34.595
I can handle any position.
What's the angle?

05:34.600 --> 05:36.557
I'm trying to secure
the contract

05:36.560 --> 05:38.517
to build the city's
new aqueduct.

05:38.520 --> 05:43.515
This man is my only viable
competition still standing.

05:43.720 --> 05:44.710
Hmm.

05:46.400 --> 05:48.073
What's in it for me?

05:48.080 --> 05:49.992
Besides a lesson
in politics?

05:50.000 --> 05:53.391
Pfft! That's a lesson
I could teach.

05:53.400 --> 05:56.359
This gentleman
is a right-minded individual,

05:56.360 --> 05:57.999
deeply concerned
with establishing

05:58.000 --> 05:59.275
orphan asylums in his name

05:59.280 --> 06:01.715
after building his fortune
on the backs of 10-year-olds

06:01.720 --> 06:03.154
in his coal mines.

06:04.440 --> 06:06.477
Orrin Lansing.

06:07.640 --> 06:09.074
That son of a bitch
hypocrite

06:09.080 --> 06:11.800
who led the charge
to close down my place uptown?

06:11.800 --> 06:14.269
One and the same.

06:14.280 --> 06:16.317
Huh. Hmm.

06:17.680 --> 06:19.034
<i>Bloody cat keeps staring...</i>

06:19.040 --> 06:21.396
<i>Something's not right
with this Bartlett case.</i>

06:21.400 --> 06:23.392
Waiting to pounce.

06:23.400 --> 06:24.800
Come on, Corky,

06:25.040 --> 06:26.952
you've been stuck on this case
for more than a week now

06:26.960 --> 06:28.633
and still haven't found
anything.

06:28.640 --> 06:30.791
A rich boy killed his daddy
and himself,

06:30.800 --> 06:31.790
end of story.

06:33.760 --> 06:36.514
The girl's parents don't
even give a shite where she is,

06:36.520 --> 06:37.510
Why do you?

06:37.520 --> 06:40.035
Because Teresa Trembley
knows what happened to Bartlett.

06:49.080 --> 06:51.072
Missus O'Dwyer?

06:58.560 --> 07:01.632
<i>Fellas, come take a look.</i>

07:02.760 --> 07:04.638
<i>Now Mab O'Dwyer's
vanished too.</i>

07:07.680 --> 07:09.990
Empty as a woman's promises.

07:14.720 --> 07:16.791
You guys ever gonna stop?

07:20.880 --> 07:24.078
The Newcastle rail spur's
been abandoned, sir.

07:24.080 --> 07:26.197
Contract will not be awarded.

07:26.640 --> 07:29.439
We built a goddamned
train track to nowhere.

07:31.400 --> 07:34.279
All that worthless
stock money burned.

07:38.960 --> 07:42.032
Darling, off so soon?

07:42.560 --> 07:44.472
"Worthless stock?"

07:44.760 --> 07:45.750
What's the trouble,
Robert?

07:45.760 --> 07:48.559
No trouble, my sweet,

07:48.560 --> 07:52.110
other than the fact
that my glass is empty.

07:53.480 --> 07:55.915
Hell of a predicament
to find oneself in

07:55.920 --> 07:56.990
this time of the day.

08:00.160 --> 08:01.799
How much is lost?

08:04.280 --> 08:06.397
I'm not a fool, Robert.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.916
I know what a man
looks like in defeat.

08:09.400 --> 08:11.039
I bet you do.

08:11.400 --> 08:14.074
I can be
of some assistance.

08:15.920 --> 08:18.640
Forgive me, darling,

08:19.200 --> 08:20.316
but you don't have
the best record

08:20.320 --> 08:22.755
when it comes to assisting
the men in your life.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.678
Now, why don't you
run along...

08:26.680 --> 08:29.240
...and find some poor,
destitute negros

08:29.240 --> 08:31.835
that actually need rescuing,

08:32.400 --> 08:34.437
and leave me the hell alone
to figure out what,

08:34.440 --> 08:38.150
if anything,
can be done here.

08:54.480 --> 08:56.995
Are you feeling
the kicks yet?

08:58.000 --> 09:01.311
As rough a pounding
as I've ever been given.

09:01.320 --> 09:03.152
He's a strong
little mule.

09:03.160 --> 09:05.152
You're a brave one,
Miss Eva.

09:05.160 --> 09:07.675
I would have gone in
for a cleaning myself.

09:07.680 --> 09:09.512
Crossed my mind.

09:09.520 --> 09:10.920
What changed?

09:13.680 --> 09:16.991
Who can ever say
what changes a person's mind?

09:17.840 --> 09:20.150
Sometimes life
just takes charge.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.880
So who's the lucky
father to be?

09:22.880 --> 09:26.157
Not that you could ever
tell for certain.

09:26.160 --> 09:28.800
There is a reason my name
is on the door, sweetheart.

09:28.800 --> 09:29.790
When I lie down,

09:29.800 --> 09:31.029
it's because
I wanna lie down.

09:31.040 --> 09:33.509
Or because I want something
from the man

09:33.520 --> 09:35.432
I lie down with.

09:35.720 --> 09:39.430
Compared to you girls,
I'm practically a virgin.

09:39.440 --> 09:42.239
<i>Who is looking
for a good time?</i>

09:44.360 --> 09:47.080
Oh. Watch it,
you big animal.

09:48.920 --> 09:50.434
There's our guest of honor.

09:55.760 --> 09:57.991
Oh, Corcoran,
you have a visitor.

10:00.040 --> 10:01.030
Missus McGrath.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.554
Detective.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.879
I'm afraid I need
your assistance again.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.199
What's the trouble?

10:08.560 --> 10:11.359
Since me husband's
most welcome departure...

10:11.360 --> 10:13.079
God bless him,

10:13.080 --> 10:15.675
my landlord's been
making advances.

10:15.680 --> 10:17.990
I pay the rent,
keep the place in order.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.753
No reason he should be
hornin' after me.

10:19.760 --> 10:21.035
What's he been doing?

10:21.040 --> 10:23.874
The other day he had me
cornered in the hallway,

10:23.880 --> 10:25.439
when me boy Michael
came upon us.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.752
I'd be happy
to sort him out for you.

10:28.760 --> 10:30.672
Oh, I can handle myself
all right.

10:30.680 --> 10:32.717
Not the first baboon
I've had giving chase.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.070
It's Michael
I'm worried about.

10:38.080 --> 10:40.436
He's the man
of the house now.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.031
Bit too eager
to play the part.

10:44.080 --> 10:46.390
He's gone
and got himself a gun.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.720
I'll go see the boy.
We'll have a little chat.

10:54.280 --> 10:55.600
<i>Norbert.</i>

10:58.040 --> 11:00.111
I was hoping
I'd find you here.

11:00.600 --> 11:01.750
It's Robert.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.480
Gone missing, has he?

11:04.480 --> 11:07.951
I'd check the usual
disreputable haunts.

11:07.960 --> 11:12.751
Your son...
is losing all your family fortune.

11:12.760 --> 11:15.116
And that surprises you?

11:15.120 --> 11:16.679
Surely you knew
when you married him

11:16.680 --> 11:19.320
he was good for little
beyond diversion.

11:19.320 --> 11:21.551
This is
the Morehouse legacy.

11:22.280 --> 11:25.751
All you labored to build
all these years.

11:26.760 --> 11:28.433
You would hate
to wind up penniless,

11:28.440 --> 11:29.874
wouldn't you?
Hmm.

11:29.880 --> 11:31.633
A senseless point to argue,
Norbert.

11:31.640 --> 11:32.756
Hmm.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.194
But more than that,
I'd hate for Robert

11:34.200 --> 11:36.954
to think himself
a failure.

11:38.920 --> 11:39.956
I have a meeting to keep.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.952
I wish you both
the best of luck.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.753
Just thought you should know,

11:47.760 --> 11:50.639
the boys and I stopped off
at the Trembley apartment,

11:50.640 --> 11:53.678
only to find the neighbor,
Mab O'Dwyer, disappeared.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.433
Took off kind of a sudden.

11:55.440 --> 11:57.272
That can't be a coincidence.

11:57.280 --> 12:00.159
Most people can't wait to get
the hell out of Five Points.

12:00.160 --> 12:01.879
The woman lived there
for 16 years

12:01.880 --> 12:03.951
and she suddenly ups
and leaves?

12:03.960 --> 12:06.475
Maybe she's sick of seeing
your ugly mug.

12:06.800 --> 12:07.836
What do you want?

12:07.840 --> 12:10.833
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!
Enough, detective, enough!

12:10.840 --> 12:12.240
Enough of this bullshit
obsession

12:12.240 --> 12:13.959
with the Bartlett case.

12:13.960 --> 12:14.552
Yes, sir.

12:14.560 --> 12:18.349
<i>And don't let me
tell you that again.</i>

12:19.360 --> 12:22.797
Um, Donovan,
another issue, if I may?

12:22.800 --> 12:24.837
Finally,
a change of subject.

12:24.840 --> 12:27.435
I have a problem
with a certain landlord.

12:27.440 --> 12:28.840
I can smack the sin
out of him,

12:28.840 --> 12:32.277
but I'm trying to fix this
without raising a hand.

12:32.280 --> 12:33.634
Admirable change of pace,

12:33.640 --> 12:36.712
<i>but sometimes one should stick
with the simplest method.</i>

12:36.720 --> 12:38.074
I wanna set an example
for a kid

12:38.080 --> 12:40.549
who's seen his fair share
of violence.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.279
Who's the landlord?

12:42.280 --> 12:44.749
Hannigan...
over on Chatham.

12:44.760 --> 12:48.151
Ah, William Hannigan.
He's a real cavan man.

12:48.160 --> 12:49.833
As mean as they come.

12:49.840 --> 12:51.479
<i>Best way to influence
a man like that</i>

12:51.480 --> 12:52.834
is to go straight
at his wallet.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.877
He'll be suing for peace
in no time.

12:54.880 --> 12:56.109
How's that?

12:57.120 --> 12:59.840
Well, I'll have my secretary
send Patrick Daley

12:59.840 --> 13:01.479
from the buildings
department by.

13:01.480 --> 13:04.120
He'll perform a full-on
site inspection.

13:04.120 --> 13:05.713
Amazing the trouble
those lads can cause

13:05.720 --> 13:07.393
without raising a hand.

13:07.400 --> 13:08.550
<i>Buy Daley a few drinks,</i>

13:08.560 --> 13:11.712
and he'll put on
a real show for ye.

13:13.440 --> 13:14.476
Thank you.

13:42.320 --> 13:43.993
<i>That's all right, my dear.
That's all right.</i>

13:44.000 --> 13:45.434
Get it all out.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.312
<i>Lean over, ma'am.
That's it.</i>

13:55.320 --> 13:56.879
Who are you?

13:56.880 --> 13:57.950
Doctor Freeman.

13:57.960 --> 13:59.713
No kiddin'.

13:59.720 --> 14:02.599
The first negro doctor
I've ever seen.

14:03.040 --> 14:04.474
Well, welcome to Five Points,

14:04.480 --> 14:05.880
or should I say,
hell on earth.

14:05.880 --> 14:07.553
Thanks for the
welcome, but I live here.

14:07.560 --> 14:08.550
Whew!
That's awful.

14:08.560 --> 14:10.074
I thought the mission
sent you, too.

14:10.080 --> 14:11.639
What is your diagnosis?

14:11.640 --> 14:13.472
Well, I'd say we've got
a cholera outbreak

14:13.480 --> 14:14.630
on our hands.

14:14.640 --> 14:16.120
Same symptoms
of everyone I ask:

14:16.120 --> 14:18.112
uh, bloody diarrhea,
vomiting,

14:18.120 --> 14:19.793
dazed by fevers.

14:21.200 --> 14:22.600
I've not yet made it
to the back room,

14:22.600 --> 14:24.831
but I surmise
it's much of the same.

14:27.840 --> 14:30.355
No. No. No.
Leave me.

14:30.360 --> 14:32.477
I, I can't.

14:32.480 --> 14:35.154
And what am I gonna do
with writing at my age, Sara?

14:35.160 --> 14:38.153
It's just, it's...
It's just pure idleness.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.917
Your husband
wasn't at his office, so I...

14:56.920 --> 14:58.036
Is he here?

14:58.040 --> 15:01.477
No. He's out visiting
a patient.

15:01.920 --> 15:03.274
He may be a while.

15:04.280 --> 15:05.953
<i>You're welcome to come in.</i>

15:06.400 --> 15:08.596
<i>That way you
can meet my mother.</i>

15:11.080 --> 15:12.719
Hattie Lemaster.

15:12.720 --> 15:14.757
Momma, Ellen Corcoran.

15:15.400 --> 15:16.993
Ma'am.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.036
My friend.

15:27.440 --> 15:29.875
How are you finding
Five Points?

15:30.320 --> 15:32.880
Loud and crowded,
mainly.

15:37.200 --> 15:40.193
We were just
learning the alphabet.

15:41.600 --> 15:46.391
Pardon me, but I would
rather do something more productive.

15:46.400 --> 15:48.676
With all the projects
in a house,

15:48.680 --> 15:52.720
how often in your day
do you stop to read,

15:52.720 --> 15:54.234
much less write?

15:54.240 --> 15:56.914
Reading old correspondence
is my only comfort

15:56.920 --> 16:00.550
when the wrong memories
take over.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.512
When I hate to be alone,

16:03.520 --> 16:06.957
but I don't know how
to be around others.

16:07.280 --> 16:09.920
As if I were unworthy
of company.

16:09.920 --> 16:12.276
<i>Recently, I've been...</i>

16:13.120 --> 16:18.149
Ellen, you can speak
freely here.

16:18.800 --> 16:19.790
My mother and I,

16:19.800 --> 16:22.269
we are no strangers
to darkness.

16:23.640 --> 16:25.597
I feel it coming on.

16:25.600 --> 16:30.470
The knocking
and the crying in my head,

16:31.840 --> 16:34.674
like a storm about to break.

16:38.120 --> 16:39.634
I can't.

16:40.920 --> 16:44.709
Not again.
Not alone.

16:45.720 --> 16:47.677
Can't what?

16:49.960 --> 16:51.952
Raise another child.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.278
Have you told Kevin?

16:58.160 --> 17:01.312
I haven't spoken to my husband
in almost a month.

17:01.320 --> 17:03.915
He's forgotten about me,
about everything we ever had.

17:03.920 --> 17:07.800
He, he is ashamed of me...

17:09.160 --> 17:11.152
And maybe he should be.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.960
I can't be the messenger
bringing more bad news.

17:17.960 --> 17:20.429
Allow me.
Miss Ellen,

17:20.960 --> 17:22.633
you bringing him news

17:22.640 --> 17:25.280
tells him that
you are still his wife.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.595
He needs to hear that
from you,

17:29.600 --> 17:30.875
and real soon.

17:37.480 --> 17:40.439
The diseased
describe an abrupt onset;

17:40.440 --> 17:42.557
an indisputable characteristic
of cholera.

17:42.560 --> 17:45.519
Yet only the young and old
seem to be afflicted here.

17:45.520 --> 17:47.352
What are you suggesting?

17:47.360 --> 17:50.034
Cholera does not
discriminate by age or strength.

17:50.040 --> 17:52.032
It fells those in their prime
as well.

17:52.040 --> 17:52.951
Please, doctor,

17:52.960 --> 17:54.758
I was trained at the Columbia
college of surgeons.

17:54.760 --> 17:56.353
Is that so?

17:56.360 --> 17:58.238
Well, if this is cholera,
then tell me,

17:58.240 --> 18:00.357
why are there
no sick adults here?

18:03.800 --> 18:05.029
Good day.

18:08.520 --> 18:10.000
Afternoon.

18:12.600 --> 18:16.560
I, uh, thought I'd swing by,

18:16.560 --> 18:17.994
see how you been lately.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.914
Could be worse.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.279
Take a walk with me?

18:25.280 --> 18:26.600
I'm busy.

18:27.720 --> 18:29.598
It wasn't a question.

18:34.120 --> 18:36.112
Back after a piss.

18:40.200 --> 18:42.715
So, Michael,

18:42.720 --> 18:45.030
your mother says you're having
a problem with your landlord.

18:47.120 --> 18:51.000
<i>Cod fish!
Cod fish here!</i>

18:56.680 --> 18:58.353
Missus Corcoran?

18:59.760 --> 19:02.036
I'm looking for my...

19:02.040 --> 19:03.554
For Kevin.

19:03.560 --> 19:04.789
<i>Uh, he's not here.</i>

19:06.320 --> 19:09.279
If I were you,
I'd try back at night.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.117
This is where he's been?

19:12.640 --> 19:14.359
This is where he works.

19:15.640 --> 19:17.791
Should I tell your husband
you stopped by?

19:19.840 --> 19:22.230
No. Thank you.

19:28.880 --> 19:30.200
Never mind that.

19:31.720 --> 19:33.757
What did she want?

19:33.760 --> 19:35.752
Nothing from you.

19:38.680 --> 19:41.514
Come sit with daddy,
little monkey.

19:43.160 --> 19:45.550
Oh, you remind me
of this ripe little native

19:45.560 --> 19:48.359
I once knew in Guatemala.

19:48.360 --> 19:51.273
Let's see if you're
as malleable as she was.

19:51.280 --> 19:53.590
Aren't you thirsty, boy?

19:53.600 --> 19:57.116
Here,
let's have another.

19:57.120 --> 19:58.634
Fine idea.

19:58.640 --> 20:03.431
<i>I do love my booze.</i>

20:08.720 --> 20:12.270
To you, king Lansing.

20:17.240 --> 20:18.356
Ow!

20:18.360 --> 20:20.352
Giddy up.

20:20.360 --> 20:23.034
Daddy's going to ride you
till your kidneys quiver.

20:23.040 --> 20:24.554
Oh!

20:25.800 --> 20:26.790
Oh!

20:29.240 --> 20:31.232
We're going to get you
feeling better, Hazel.

20:33.680 --> 20:35.273
How is she, doctor?

20:36.680 --> 20:39.832
It's a difficult case,
I'm afraid.

20:39.840 --> 20:41.752
Well, he don't know
what's going on,

20:41.760 --> 20:44.036
and you's about as useless
as he is.

20:44.040 --> 20:45.030
With your fancy talk,

20:45.040 --> 20:46.997
you may as well be back
on that plantation

20:47.000 --> 20:48.639
bowing down
to them crackers.

20:48.640 --> 20:50.393
I am a free man,
a doctor,

20:50.400 --> 20:52.392
practicing medicine
in New York City.

20:52.400 --> 20:55.438
Free? Why, you's nothing more
than a white man's mule

20:55.440 --> 20:57.113
in a white man's war.

20:57.120 --> 20:58.270
Come around here
trying to think

20:58.280 --> 20:59.634
and act like the white man,
too.

20:59.640 --> 21:01.279
Oh, you talk all you want,

21:01.280 --> 21:02.634
but progress
and self-betterment

21:02.640 --> 21:06.031
are not the exclusive domain
of the white man, Mr. Turnow.

21:06.040 --> 21:09.477
And besides,
I'm the only mule you got.

21:15.120 --> 21:18.192
Go ahead, shoot.

21:18.200 --> 21:19.190
With what?

21:27.240 --> 21:28.674
Come on.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.753
Look at this poor bastard.

21:32.680 --> 21:34.637
I see that every day.

21:35.640 --> 21:37.552
So do I.

21:37.960 --> 21:40.395
But it's not pig's brains
that I see splattered.

21:41.400 --> 21:42.470
What of it?

21:43.880 --> 21:45.280
<i>It's hard to tell sometimes,</i>

21:45.280 --> 21:48.830
<i>but there is a difference
between a man and an animal,</i>

21:50.040 --> 21:51.679
and you'll know sure enough

21:51.680 --> 21:53.433
if you ever have
the misfortune

21:53.440 --> 21:54.840
of actually killing someone.

21:56.720 --> 22:00.077
If it was your mother,
what would you do?

22:00.480 --> 22:02.119
At your age?

22:02.120 --> 22:04.316
I'd probably have shot
the bastard...

22:04.320 --> 22:05.834
...and then hung for it.

22:09.360 --> 22:11.352
My mother...

22:12.960 --> 22:15.680
I can't stand to see her
bothered like that.

22:19.160 --> 22:21.231
No woman should ever be.

22:22.680 --> 22:25.991
How about I take care
of that landlord,

22:26.000 --> 22:29.880
and then, if you want,
I could teach you to box

22:30.240 --> 22:31.879
so you can handle yourself.

22:33.760 --> 22:36.275
Hmm. Maybe that's
an okay idea.

22:36.520 --> 22:38.796
Nobody goes to
prison in this city

22:38.800 --> 22:40.359
for smacking somebody
that deserves it.

22:40.360 --> 22:44.798
But you shoot a man dead,
you're sure to hang.

22:52.560 --> 22:54.756
Well, if it isn't father.

22:54.760 --> 22:58.310
What bedeviling twist of fate
brings you to our door?

22:58.320 --> 22:59.310
<i>Word on the street is...</i>

22:59.320 --> 23:02.438
<i>...that the Morehouse fortune
is dwindling.</i>

23:02.840 --> 23:04.832
Hemorrhaging funds.

23:04.840 --> 23:05.830
You need help.

23:07.560 --> 23:10.029
We already have a full staff,
father.

23:10.400 --> 23:11.629
Perhaps try the neighbors?

23:13.200 --> 23:16.238
I believe their housekeeper
recently took ill.

23:17.240 --> 23:19.880
I want back into
the business, Robert.

23:20.280 --> 23:21.555
It's rather sad
when one's elders

23:21.560 --> 23:24.598
begins exhibiting
early signs of dementia,

23:25.280 --> 23:27.556
wouldn't you say?
Hmm?

23:27.560 --> 23:29.153
You need my expertise.

23:29.160 --> 23:32.471
You'd be foolish
to pretend otherwise.

23:33.840 --> 23:36.150
Your return
to the family business

23:36.160 --> 23:39.358
wasn't ever part
of the plan, father.

23:39.360 --> 23:41.920
You were paid handsomely
for your testimony

23:41.920 --> 23:47.120
and now, your assistance
is no longer required.

23:49.880 --> 23:52.918
That big heart
you pride yourself on

23:52.920 --> 23:56.118
is a worthless attribute
in finance.

23:58.200 --> 23:59.554
Let him help.

24:00.720 --> 24:02.712
Why bother?

24:04.040 --> 24:06.316
The money's already gone.

24:09.800 --> 24:11.473
The money's already gone.

24:16.680 --> 24:19.240
I'll ask only once.

24:19.240 --> 24:20.913
Robert, please.

24:26.680 --> 24:30.276
Father...
You will work for me.

24:34.960 --> 24:36.633
Now get the hell
out of my chair.

25:30.200 --> 25:31.190
Mother of God!

25:31.200 --> 25:32.873
Oh no, not the camera!

25:50.160 --> 25:51.150
Shit!

25:59.640 --> 26:02.474
What've you been eating?
Anything unusual?

26:02.480 --> 26:04.517
I don't know.

26:05.040 --> 26:07.760
Same as I always do,
I supposed.

26:10.240 --> 26:13.119
Potatoes...
uh, odd scrap of meat.

26:13.120 --> 26:14.110
And you?

26:18.520 --> 26:20.113
I'm sorry.

26:21.880 --> 26:23.633
Where do you get
your water from?

26:23.640 --> 26:26.519
<i>A well out back.</i>

26:26.520 --> 26:27.920
Does Hazel drink
from the well out back?

26:27.920 --> 26:29.354
Yes. Yes, she does.

26:29.360 --> 26:30.396
Can you take me?

26:30.400 --> 26:32.710
Sure. They just dug
it not too long ago.

26:36.120 --> 26:38.112
Excuse me, Mister Morehouse.

26:41.040 --> 26:43.316
Hello, father.
Back already?

26:43.320 --> 26:45.312
Robert, I want you to meet
Mister Maillard.

26:45.320 --> 26:47.232
This is my son,
Robert.

26:47.240 --> 26:48.469
Mister Maillard.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.910
I want to talk to you
about something.

26:52.240 --> 26:53.879
You have my full attention.

26:56.480 --> 26:58.119
We've decided
to water the stock

26:58.120 --> 27:00.191
in both the northern
and Richmond,

27:00.200 --> 27:02.157
as well as the central,
Milford,

27:02.160 --> 27:04.516
and Raritan railroads.

27:04.520 --> 27:05.920
We?

27:06.200 --> 27:08.237
Mister Maillard here
is going to help us

27:08.240 --> 27:09.674
issue the necessary bonds.

27:09.680 --> 27:12.070
With my connections
in the western states,

27:12.080 --> 27:13.992
we're able to spread rumors
about which railroads

27:14.000 --> 27:16.356
<i>will be stitched together
with the Union Pacific.</i>

27:16.360 --> 27:18.636
Surely you must be joking.

27:18.640 --> 27:20.996
I never joke about money,
Robert.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.798
Well, I won't be part of it.

27:25.000 --> 27:29.040
My son,
a bastion of nobility.

27:29.040 --> 27:31.600
Modicums of deceit
are one thing, father,

27:31.600 --> 27:35.514
but I will not be part
of blatant corruption.

27:37.040 --> 27:39.191
It's no different
from that pathetic little spur

27:39.200 --> 27:40.190
in Pennsylvania

27:40.200 --> 27:41.600
into which you dumped
our fortune.

27:41.600 --> 27:42.670
Except, this time,

27:42.680 --> 27:46.310
we'll be on the other side...
the victorious side.

27:49.440 --> 27:51.477
The answer is no.

27:52.560 --> 27:56.839
If you would like a "yes",
go buy it from somebody else.

28:11.400 --> 28:12.720
We might have underestimated

28:12.720 --> 28:14.712
just how much tincture
is necessary

28:14.720 --> 28:16.393
to knock the pig out.

28:18.240 --> 28:20.471
Again, I'm very sorry.

28:20.480 --> 28:21.470
Hmm.

28:23.960 --> 28:26.520
Have I ever told you
about the time...

28:27.120 --> 28:29.794
...I pissed in that pimp's hat?

28:29.800 --> 28:30.790
No.

28:30.800 --> 28:32.359
<i>Hmm.</i>

28:32.640 --> 28:34.757
It was quite an offloading.

28:36.120 --> 28:38.874
I nearly filled it
right up to the brim.

28:40.600 --> 28:42.592
I was a young patrolman.

28:42.600 --> 28:44.751
I thought humiliating that pimp
would go far

28:44.760 --> 28:47.275
towards keeping my beat
in line.

28:48.280 --> 28:52.240
It was an arrogant
miscalculation.

28:58.280 --> 29:02.433
Before the day was through,
nine men lay dead.

29:04.120 --> 29:05.998
A nasty bit of business.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.960
Speaking of nasty bits
of business...

29:12.960 --> 29:15.953
...with all the conspiring
we're doing,

29:15.960 --> 29:18.031
I fear I've been
neglecting you.

29:25.320 --> 29:28.154
Neglect sometimes
feeds anticipation.

29:40.440 --> 29:42.238
That's it, Miss Heissen,

29:42.240 --> 29:43.879
just like old times.

29:45.080 --> 29:46.753
I can't believe those rebel curs

29:46.760 --> 29:50.071
are going to make the negros
fight their war for them now.

29:50.080 --> 29:51.480
It boggles the mind.

29:51.480 --> 29:56.794
As with
everything, the war boils down to money.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.676
Speaking of,
I saw your N and R is soaring.

30:03.160 --> 30:04.674
- Pardon?
<i>- Mm...</i>

30:04.680 --> 30:06.672
<i>I only wish
I'd known to invest.</i>

30:19.160 --> 30:20.435
You must be Patrick Daley.

30:20.440 --> 30:21.635
Ah, one in the same.

30:21.640 --> 30:22.676
Kevin Corcoran.

30:22.680 --> 30:23.955
Ah.

30:23.960 --> 30:25.280
So, you could use
my expertise

30:25.280 --> 30:27.476
with a particularly
vexing landlord.

30:27.480 --> 30:29.836
Aye. A drink?

30:29.840 --> 30:31.035
Certainly.

30:33.600 --> 30:35.751
Cheers.

30:36.760 --> 30:38.672
Ah...

30:39.680 --> 30:40.796
Another.

30:48.680 --> 30:50.956
What do you see
in front of you, detective?

30:51.080 --> 30:52.434
Besides a level,
a tape measure,

30:52.440 --> 30:54.477
and a plumb bob?

30:54.480 --> 30:55.516
The handsomest,

30:55.520 --> 30:58.558
most liberal tap jockey
in the whole Union.

30:58.560 --> 31:00.279
The more I pour,
the handsomer I get.

31:01.280 --> 31:02.270
Right.

31:08.560 --> 31:12.952
Now, they certainly appear
innocent enough.

31:12.960 --> 31:14.679
But in the right hands,

31:14.680 --> 31:16.751
these are less tools
of construction,

31:16.760 --> 31:18.240
than destruction.

31:20.600 --> 31:22.557
Mister Donovan,
I told him you were busy,

31:22.560 --> 31:24.552
but he threatened
to throttle me, sir.

31:24.560 --> 31:25.550
It's all right, lad.

31:25.560 --> 31:27.313
If I find out
you had anything to do

31:27.320 --> 31:29.437
with that perfidy
at Eva's Paradise,

31:29.440 --> 31:30.430
you will wish
you'd never left

31:30.440 --> 31:32.591
that rancid potato bog
you call home.

31:32.600 --> 31:33.795
Good day to you,
Mister Lansing.

31:33.800 --> 31:35.439
I was just going over
my proposal

31:35.440 --> 31:37.272
for the new aqueduct.

31:37.280 --> 31:39.590
If you think
you'll intimidate me

31:39.600 --> 31:41.637
into dropping my bid,

31:41.640 --> 31:44.519
well, you are as stupid
as you are duplicitous.

31:44.520 --> 31:45.954
I am a goddamn
honest businessman

31:45.960 --> 31:47.838
and I will not sink
to your level.

31:47.840 --> 31:49.479
What you call honesty,

31:49.480 --> 31:53.440
others might refer to
as thievery and extortion.

31:53.440 --> 31:55.671
Men like me
built this country

31:55.680 --> 31:57.956
with our own hands,

31:57.960 --> 32:01.397
and you foreign scum...

32:01.520 --> 32:03.876
...are trying to subvert
everything we have done.

32:03.880 --> 32:06.111
I believe you mean
you exploited the hands

32:06.120 --> 32:08.476
of the red man
and the black man

32:08.480 --> 32:10.551
to build it for ye.

32:10.560 --> 32:13.439
Well, neat trick,
by the way.

32:13.440 --> 32:15.955
You laugh now,
paddy,

32:15.960 --> 32:17.917
but you know this:

32:17.920 --> 32:20.151
My associates and I...

32:20.160 --> 32:22.311
will purge that tammany
nest of vipers

32:22.320 --> 32:24.152
on Nassau Street...

32:24.160 --> 32:25.560
and sweep you back
into the sea

32:25.560 --> 32:26.789
once and for all.

32:26.800 --> 32:29.360
Let me tell you something:

32:29.360 --> 32:31.477
I'm an American.

32:31.480 --> 32:34.314
I am an American
and I will build that aqueduct

32:34.320 --> 32:36.277
whether you wish it
or not.

32:38.840 --> 32:40.513
And if you'll excuse me,

32:40.520 --> 32:42.796
I believe my next appointment
is here.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.753
Sisters,
please come in.

32:45.760 --> 32:47.160
<i>Thank you.</i>

32:52.160 --> 32:53.674
Have a seat, please.

33:08.160 --> 33:11.676
I can violate any structure
in the city into oblivion.

33:11.680 --> 33:12.670
Well, God bless ya.

33:12.680 --> 33:14.751
Ah. Don't bless me,
detective.

33:14.760 --> 33:16.433
Bless the organization.

33:16.440 --> 33:17.669
Tammany takes care
of its own.

33:20.760 --> 33:23.992
Well, let's see
if you can work your magic

33:24.000 --> 33:24.990
over on Chatham.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.036
Right.

33:26.040 --> 33:28.430
Steady as
a Methodist minister.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.238
I have a few buildings
ahead of you to start.

33:30.240 --> 33:32.550
Shall we say,
five o'clock?

33:32.560 --> 33:33.960
Five.

33:33.960 --> 33:35.280
You met my friend?

33:35.280 --> 33:36.999
I did.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.275
<i>You're looking good.</i>

34:03.280 --> 34:06.478
You went behind my back
and issued those bonds.

34:06.480 --> 34:08.039
You can thank me later.

34:13.679 --> 34:15.273
Father...

34:15.280 --> 34:17.317
<i>Somebody had to
do something, Robert.</i>

34:17.320 --> 34:20.074
After all, you have a wife
to keep happy now.

34:21.800 --> 34:23.598
The same way you made
mother happy?

34:27.639 --> 34:31.315
The only thing that made
your mother happy was gin.

34:31.320 --> 34:34.199
Maybe she drank
to escape life with you.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.117
I couldn't take a drink
out of that woman's hands

34:39.120 --> 34:41.190
without her other one
reaching for the bottle.

34:41.199 --> 34:43.317
That woman was my mother.

34:43.320 --> 34:44.674
And none too pleased
about it,

34:44.679 --> 34:46.159
truth be told.

34:46.159 --> 34:48.719
GRUNTS)

35:00.280 --> 35:02.237
Pull it.

35:02.240 --> 35:04.550
Norbert! Stop it! James!

35:04.560 --> 35:06.199
Stop it!

35:07.720 --> 35:09.279
Stop it! Enough!

35:09.560 --> 35:10.835
Stop it! Enough!

35:15.280 --> 35:17.237
What is wrong with you?

35:19.360 --> 35:22.080
Go on, go.
Get out of here.

35:29.160 --> 35:31.436
You would've killed me.

35:31.880 --> 35:33.792
I'm not the one
who drew a pistol.

35:37.560 --> 35:39.597
I'll not forget this day.

35:42.240 --> 35:44.550
I can't thank you
enough, detective,

35:44.560 --> 35:47.439
for talking sense into Michael.

35:47.440 --> 35:49.716
Your boy will be just fine.

35:49.720 --> 35:51.871
He's at a rough age
for any lad.

35:51.880 --> 35:55.430
Well, it helps a world being
around a man such as yourself.

35:58.320 --> 36:02.280
Is that a touch of kildare
I hear in your voice?

36:02.600 --> 36:03.795
I'm from Newbridge.

36:03.800 --> 36:05.120
Really?

36:05.120 --> 36:07.351
My mother was born
in Kilcullen.

36:07.360 --> 36:08.714
I know it well.

36:08.720 --> 36:10.393
My father favored
a butcher's there.

36:13.040 --> 36:14.713
Are you glad
you came here?

36:16.720 --> 36:18.757
Who wouldn't wanna
come to America?

36:18.760 --> 36:21.480
<i>Oh, no, no,
no, no, no, no, sir.</i>

36:21.480 --> 36:23.278
<i>This will most definitely
not do.</i>

36:23.280 --> 36:26.000
<i>Why, inspector, please.</i>

36:26.000 --> 36:28.469
All the other steps
are up to code.

36:29.480 --> 36:31.597
Um, possibly you could,

36:31.600 --> 36:33.796
you could find it in your heart
just this once

36:33.800 --> 36:36.360
to, to make an exception.

36:36.360 --> 36:39.000
I'll do anything,
anything.

36:40.440 --> 36:43.797
What are you suggesting,
Mister Hannigan?

36:43.800 --> 36:45.075
This step here,

36:45.080 --> 36:47.879
in addition to the vertical
support issue in the entry,

36:47.880 --> 36:49.439
complicated by...

36:49.440 --> 36:52.592
oh my... my, my, my.
So many violations.

36:55.040 --> 36:57.680
Ah, surely you must
know my cousin,

36:57.680 --> 36:58.875
Kentigerna McGrath?

37:06.560 --> 37:10.270
Lansing's out of control.
He must be contained.

37:10.280 --> 37:12.237
I'm gonna need more
from ye.

37:12.240 --> 37:15.597
Aye... Sir.

37:15.600 --> 37:17.512
I want you on him
like a hemorrhoid.

37:17.520 --> 37:19.273
Anybody he sees,
everything he does,

37:19.280 --> 37:22.239
you bring to me.
No detail's too trifling.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.038
The man is an avowed enemy
of the Irish race

37:24.040 --> 37:26.999
who stands against everything
we hold dear.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.037
Is this official police
business, sir, or--

37:29.040 --> 37:31.999
What this is, Mister Maguire,
is you showing appreciation

37:32.000 --> 37:34.834
for being saved
from the gallows.

37:35.160 --> 37:36.958
For let's not forget

37:36.960 --> 37:39.077
evidence of a murder
once lost

37:39.080 --> 37:41.072
can always be found.

37:42.680 --> 37:43.909
O'Hearn.

37:50.680 --> 37:53.718
Ah, this water is rife
with it.

37:53.720 --> 37:56.997
Swarms of these oblong rods.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.196
I haven't seen anything
like it before.

37:59.200 --> 38:00.680
That poor girl.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.592
Can you do anything for her?

38:03.600 --> 38:05.273
I don't know.

38:05.280 --> 38:07.920
But I'm convinced
that this unknown contagion

38:07.920 --> 38:10.196
is what's to blame
for all the illness

38:10.200 --> 38:12.192
in that building.

38:13.960 --> 38:17.351
I know it gets to you,
seeing all that suffering.

38:18.640 --> 38:19.869
Sick and the lame
I can handle,

38:19.880 --> 38:21.712
it's my profession.

38:21.720 --> 38:24.030
What got to me today
was running into a black man

38:24.040 --> 38:26.714
as bigoted
as any white man.

38:26.720 --> 38:29.189
That's a sickness
I can't cure.

38:29.200 --> 38:31.920
I had half a mind
to smack his face good.

38:31.920 --> 38:33.832
What'd that have
accomplished?

38:33.840 --> 38:36.275
I would have settled
for satisfaction.

38:36.560 --> 38:39.314
Matthew,
after all you've achieved,

38:39.320 --> 38:40.800
to lower yourself
in such a way?

38:40.800 --> 38:42.917
It's done.
Let's move on.

38:45.040 --> 38:46.030
Fine.

38:55.960 --> 38:58.953
Ellen Corcoran
stopped by today,

39:00.640 --> 39:02.757
asking to speak
with you.

39:05.080 --> 39:08.278
I told her you were
attending to patients.

39:08.560 --> 39:09.630
She seemed troubled.

39:09.640 --> 39:12.678
Well, sadly for her,
that's not unusual.

39:12.920 --> 39:17.790
Matthew,
she's with child.

39:19.280 --> 39:20.600
I know.

39:20.840 --> 39:23.958
Well then you must also know
that she's not doing well.

39:25.440 --> 39:28.000
In her head,
I mean.

39:29.600 --> 39:31.273
<i>She hasn't told Kevin,
and I think...</i>

39:31.280 --> 39:33.431
Sara, no.

39:34.440 --> 39:37.672
I'm just wondering
if we might help

39:37.680 --> 39:38.670
in some way.

39:38.680 --> 39:40.990
It is not our place
to interfere.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.356
You can't heal a marriage
like a disease.

40:32.240 --> 40:33.993
Sara.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.593
Sergeant told me
that you were here.

40:37.240 --> 40:38.879
Everything all right
with Matthew?

40:38.880 --> 40:40.758
Oh yes, he's fine.

40:40.760 --> 40:42.797
I came
for another reason.

40:47.520 --> 40:51.878
Ellen stopped by today,
looking for my husband.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.470
Well, is she unwell?

41:02.200 --> 41:04.635
She needs you...

41:04.640 --> 41:06.871
...at home with her,
instead--

41:06.880 --> 41:09.076
I appreciate your concern,

41:09.760 --> 41:11.114
but at times
there are matters

41:11.120 --> 41:12.395
between a husband
and wife that--

41:12.400 --> 41:14.960
Kevin,
she's pregnant.

41:28.560 --> 41:30.552
Get up! Get up!

41:36.000 --> 41:38.515
You slept with my wife again,
you son of a bitch!

41:38.520 --> 41:40.751
You're wrong, Corky.
I did not touch Ellen.

41:40.760 --> 41:43.912
Then...
whose child is my wife carrying?

41:46.240 --> 41:47.879
I have no idea.

41:48.880 --> 41:49.870
Take a breath.
Take a breath!

41:49.880 --> 41:52.759
You're a goddamn lying bastard.

41:52.760 --> 41:55.753
I trusted you once.
Never again!

41:55.760 --> 41:57.319
That's fair play,

41:57.320 --> 41:59.960
but I swear on the friendship
we once had.

42:05.960 --> 42:06.950
Francis...

42:08.240 --> 42:10.357
The child is not mine,
Kevin.

42:13.400 --> 42:14.550
It's not.
