WEBVTT

00:00.786 --> 00:02.886
<i>From the director of Valentine's day</i>

00:02.890 --> 00:04.124
<i>and New Year's Eve...</i>

00:05.451 --> 00:08.887
What? Tomorrow is Martin
Luther king day?

00:08.921 --> 00:10.856
Yeah, and neither
of us have dates.

00:10.890 --> 00:12.290
Too bad we're
just platonic friends.

00:17.330 --> 00:19.231
I have a right to love you.

00:19.265 --> 00:20.298
Hello.

00:20.316 --> 00:21.299
In the words
of Martin Luther King,

00:21.334 --> 00:22.801
I've just got to go for it.

00:22.835 --> 00:24.436
You're a white supremacist?

00:24.470 --> 00:25.670
You guys can just do
the fun stuff.

00:25.705 --> 00:27.522
Oh, my God.

00:29.442 --> 00:32.978
All I want is one
extraordinary moment.

00:34.514 --> 00:37.182
Sounds like you have a dream.

00:43.723 --> 00:46.024
It's
<i>Martin Luther King day.</i>

00:49.429 --> 00:51.996
So, I need you
to promote that <i>TGS.</i>

00:52.014 --> 00:54.433
No, I'm not promoting
that garbage on the show.

00:54.467 --> 00:57.636
Oh, Liz. This isn't a request,
this is an order.

00:57.670 --> 00:58.770
I've already spoken
to Jack about it.

00:58.805 --> 01:00.071
Wow.

01:00.106 --> 01:03.859
Well, now I'm going
to speak to Jack about it.

01:03.893 --> 01:06.778
The rest of you,
keep working...

01:08.064 --> 01:09.648
Lemon, I'm sorry,

01:09.682 --> 01:12.367
but Jenna has become
a huge star for this network.

01:12.401 --> 01:15.487
She's bigger than Maulik
Pancholy on <i>Whitney.</i>

01:15.521 --> 01:18.123
Look, I put up with
a lot from Jenna.

01:18.157 --> 01:20.392
A couple months ago,
she cut off my ponytail

01:20.426 --> 01:22.894
because she was jealous of the
attention that I was getting,

01:22.929 --> 01:24.863
on my own birthday.

01:29.769 --> 01:32.704
But this is new, going
to you behind my back?

01:32.738 --> 01:34.172
You can't reward her for that.

01:34.207 --> 01:35.640
My hands are tied.

01:35.675 --> 01:38.226
But, and I will, heh,
never say this again,

01:38.261 --> 01:40.745
you have a power that I don't.

01:40.780 --> 01:42.848
Besides the greatest power
of all?

01:42.882 --> 01:45.183
The ability to gestate life.

01:45.217 --> 01:46.518
Of course, Lemon.

01:46.552 --> 01:47.903
That's why the President
is always a new mom.

01:47.937 --> 01:50.722
I was referring to your
unique leverage with Jenna:

01:50.756 --> 01:52.073
Your friendship.

01:52.108 --> 01:54.993
No, I like to keep "boss Liz"
and "friend Liz" separate,

01:55.027 --> 01:57.496
because "boss Liz"
is all "paperwork, paperwork,"

01:57.530 --> 02:00.532
but "friend Liz" is all "my feet
hurt, I'm staying in tonight."

02:00.566 --> 02:04.085
Lemon, I've decided to
eliminate the NBC page program.

02:04.120 --> 02:05.237
What?

02:05.271 --> 02:06.571
I was in Washington yesterday

02:06.606 --> 02:09.107
reviewing satellite images
of Avery in North Korea.

02:09.140 --> 02:12.110
For what it's worth,
CIA analysts have confirmed

02:12.144 --> 02:14.246
that she is, indeed,
"keeping it tight."

02:14.280 --> 02:16.848
I don't know how this is about
my problem, but I trust you.

02:16.883 --> 02:19.150
I'm getting there.
While I was in Washington,

02:19.185 --> 02:21.586
I learned the house shut down
its page program.

02:21.604 --> 02:24.105
With texting and email,
a multi-million dollar system

02:24.140 --> 02:25.457
of pleasure slaves
is no longer needed.

02:25.491 --> 02:27.309
Hang on, we need the pages.

02:27.360 --> 02:31.763
Especially Kenneth.
He, uh... well, he, uh...

02:31.797 --> 02:34.149
He always scratches
that weird part of my back

02:34.200 --> 02:35.300
that I can't reach.

02:35.334 --> 02:38.069
Unless...

02:38.103 --> 02:39.070
Oh!

02:39.104 --> 02:40.772
That's the business!

02:40.806 --> 02:44.543
Now who's in charge,
winter dryness?

02:44.577 --> 02:48.246
I'm hoping that a bold,
cost-cutting move like this

02:48.280 --> 02:50.448
will impress Hank Hooper.

02:50.483 --> 02:52.551
But I've only worked
for Hank for a year.

02:52.585 --> 02:54.286
He's still difficult to read,

02:54.320 --> 02:58.290
much like that memoir Reagan
wrote the week before he died.

02:58.324 --> 03:00.225
It's, uh...scattered.

03:00.259 --> 03:02.561
Well, now I think we're
just talking about your thing.

03:02.595 --> 03:03.728
You tricked me.

03:03.763 --> 03:05.297
You know how to read Jenna.

03:05.331 --> 03:07.349
Use your power.

03:10.536 --> 03:13.605
Oh, damn it.

03:13.639 --> 03:15.273
I need some tape!

Sync and corrected by dr.jackson

03:35.094 --> 03:36.561
Hey, Tray.

03:36.596 --> 03:40.066
We just picked up your birthday
party invitations from the printer.

03:41.300 --> 03:45.020
Wait! What is this?

03:45.054 --> 03:47.572
"Give to charity please,
no presents"?

03:47.607 --> 03:48.857
Yeah, that's what you
told me to put on the card.

03:48.891 --> 03:50.191
No, Dotcom!

03:50.226 --> 03:54.813
I said, "give to charity?
Please, no. Presents!"

03:54.847 --> 03:57.482
Well, I'm sorry, but
you don't really need presents.

03:57.516 --> 03:59.250
You already have everything.

03:59.285 --> 04:02.887
I mean, you just bought Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar's bones,

04:02.922 --> 04:04.155
and he's not even dead.

04:04.189 --> 04:06.191
Wow.

04:06.225 --> 04:08.226
Maybe I do have everything.

04:08.260 --> 04:10.562
But what does that say about me?

04:10.596 --> 04:14.666
I need time alone, guys,
to think...

04:14.700 --> 04:19.803
About mortality.

04:23.375 --> 04:25.260
Hey, buddy.

04:25.311 --> 04:27.879
I thought maybe we could have
a little talk,

04:27.897 --> 04:28.880
girl to girl.

04:28.898 --> 04:30.231
Mm, sure.

04:30.266 --> 04:31.616
I love light chitchat.

04:31.651 --> 04:34.185
Did you hear about how my
fecalist murdered my kabbalist?

04:34.220 --> 04:35.520
Wow.

04:35.554 --> 04:39.024
Look, we're inside,
you can take off the sunglasses.

04:39.058 --> 04:40.942
Oh.

04:40.993 --> 04:42.127
What are those?

04:42.161 --> 04:44.129
Leeches.
They're good for your skin,

04:44.163 --> 04:45.697
and I've lost tons
of blood weight.

04:45.731 --> 04:47.899
Oh, my God!

04:47.917 --> 04:50.702
Okay, remember the pact
we made back in Chicago?

04:50.736 --> 04:52.704
Liz, if I become famous,
will you tell me

04:52.738 --> 04:54.372
if I start acting weird?

04:54.406 --> 04:56.808
Definitely.
And will you do the same for me?

04:56.842 --> 05:00.679
You? Famous? That's hilarious.

05:00.713 --> 05:02.447
Well,
I'm invoking the pact.

05:02.481 --> 05:04.766
You're putting leeches
on your face.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.584
Demi Moore does it.

05:06.602 --> 05:08.520
Plus,
it makes P.E.T.A. furious,

05:08.554 --> 05:10.121
and if P.E.T.A. doesn't
love you or hate you,

05:10.156 --> 05:12.891
you're a nobody,
like a soldier, or a teacher.

05:12.925 --> 05:17.195
Jenna, take off the leeches!

05:17.229 --> 05:18.780
I feel like I'm losing you.

05:18.814 --> 05:20.231
I mean, we used
to get lunch every week.

05:20.265 --> 05:21.900
When was the last time
we did that?

05:21.934 --> 05:24.102
You know, with my fecalist
in jail,

05:24.136 --> 05:26.204
I can eat whatever I want today.

05:26.238 --> 05:27.939
Maybe we could go to outback...

05:27.957 --> 05:29.107
I'm going to call ahead and

05:29.125 --> 05:30.775
make sure we're
in Darryl's section.

05:30.810 --> 05:32.377
Who am I?

05:32.411 --> 05:33.945
What does it all mean?

05:33.979 --> 05:36.915
Will I ever truly be happy?

05:36.949 --> 05:39.150
Tray, I hate seeing
you like this.

05:39.185 --> 05:41.469
Sitting in here listening to
your <i>depressed thoughts</i> CD.

05:41.504 --> 05:44.172
What is the meaning of ...

05:44.223 --> 05:46.307
You remember Celia's bakery
in the Bronx?

05:46.342 --> 05:48.510
It was on the corner
of Malcolm X Boulevard

05:48.561 --> 05:50.145
and guy who shot
Malcolm X Boulevard.

05:50.179 --> 05:54.482
When I was a kid, I wanted
one of those pies so bad.

05:54.517 --> 05:57.569
So I swore to myself that one
day I would become so rich

05:57.603 --> 05:59.771
I would buy every single pie
in Celia's.

05:59.805 --> 06:01.072
I wanted for nothing
as a child,

06:01.107 --> 06:02.674
but that brings
its own challenges.

06:02.708 --> 06:04.642
Shut up, Dotcom.

06:04.660 --> 06:06.377
And now look at that kid,

06:06.412 --> 06:08.947
he turned into
an incredibly fit genius

06:08.981 --> 06:10.415
who has everything
he ever wanted.

06:10.449 --> 06:11.950
So if there's no more to want,

06:11.984 --> 06:13.317
what's the point in living?

06:13.335 --> 06:15.086
Whoa, hang on, Tray.

06:15.121 --> 06:16.387
You've got a family.

06:16.422 --> 06:19.124
Great, another thing
that I've already got.

06:19.158 --> 06:23.128
Thanks for making
this situation worse.

06:25.831 --> 06:26.898
Should we get another one?

06:26.932 --> 06:28.066
If you eat four,
you get a T-shirt.

06:28.100 --> 06:34.022
So one more,
and that's two T-shirts.

06:34.056 --> 06:35.223
Oh, no, they're here.

06:35.274 --> 06:36.941
And you don't want
the paparazzi

06:36.976 --> 06:38.176
taking pictures of you?

06:38.210 --> 06:39.544
Not when I'm just trying
to have lunch

06:39.578 --> 06:42.347
with my best friend
like a normal person.

06:42.381 --> 06:44.549
It's like I'm in a cage.

06:44.583 --> 06:45.850
And not the fun kind
where you dance

06:45.885 --> 06:48.787
while U.S.C. football recruits
throw hot coins at you.

06:48.821 --> 06:51.022
I'm sorry, do you want
to sneak out the back?

06:51.056 --> 06:54.876
They'd be expecting that.

06:54.910 --> 06:59.164
Would you like a chance
to be famous, Liz?

06:59.198 --> 07:03.268
Naturally. Always.

07:03.302 --> 07:06.371
I'm from Tampa, Florida.

07:06.405 --> 07:08.173
Leech abuser!

07:09.374 --> 07:11.142
Nice try, P.E.T.A. bitches.

07:11.177 --> 07:13.377
But I saw you
hiding in the crowd.

07:13.395 --> 07:15.396
You just threw paint
on a nobody,

07:15.431 --> 07:18.583
who can't even sing

07:18.617 --> 07:21.653
Make sure you get the outback sign
in the shot or I don't get paid.

07:21.687 --> 07:24.889
Taxi!

07:24.924 --> 07:27.692
I have good news,
and I have bad news.

07:27.726 --> 07:31.663
The bad news is, I am shutting
down the page program.

07:31.697 --> 07:35.366
The good news is
for a different group of people.

07:35.400 --> 07:38.069
Uh, as the most popular page,

07:38.087 --> 07:39.537
I feel I should say something.

07:39.572 --> 07:40.872
Kenneth, please.

07:40.906 --> 07:43.074
Everyone knows that Dalton
is the most popular page.

07:43.108 --> 07:45.710
Dalton! Dalton! Dalton!

07:45.744 --> 07:50.248
Fine, but, you can't
cancel the page program.

07:50.266 --> 07:54.269
Who will take messages or
seat audiences or order lunch?

07:54.303 --> 07:57.288
Today, all of those tasks can
be managed electronically.

07:57.323 --> 07:59.357
You're just going
to automate us?

07:59.391 --> 08:01.893
Excuse me, sir, but

08:01.927 --> 08:05.947
this reminds me of
the tale of John Henry.

08:05.981 --> 08:07.448
Now, gather 'round friends and...

08:07.483 --> 08:09.767
We all know about
John Henry, Kenneth.

08:09.785 --> 08:10.935
It's just a story.

08:10.970 --> 08:12.904
Well then, I know
about another story

08:12.938 --> 08:14.572
that turned out to be true.

08:14.607 --> 08:18.776
It's about a virgin who
gave birth to a man who

08:18.794 --> 08:20.812
had some funny ideas.

08:20.846 --> 08:23.281
That virgin was my sister.

08:23.299 --> 08:26.251
And her son, Lyle,
has a learning disability.

08:26.285 --> 08:27.919
Security will escort you out.

08:27.953 --> 08:30.421
And these uniforms are still
the property of NBC,

08:30.456 --> 08:33.892
and we'll need them back.

08:33.926 --> 08:36.144
You are insane!

08:36.178 --> 08:37.828
You knew that
P.E.T.A. guy was there.

08:37.863 --> 08:41.182
Look, I'm sorry, I couldn't be
photographed with paint on me.

08:41.232 --> 08:42.299
I'd look like you do right now.

08:42.333 --> 08:44.302
That is psychopath behavior.

08:44.320 --> 08:46.821
How did I ever even become
friends with someone like you?

08:46.855 --> 08:50.474
If I remember correctly,
Elizabeth,

08:50.492 --> 08:52.860
we became friends because
I felt bad for you,

08:52.912 --> 08:54.829
standing alone
at that party like a loser.

08:54.863 --> 08:56.614
Yeah, 'cause I really
wanted to talk to the girl

08:56.649 --> 08:58.783
who was wrestling
in a kiddie pool full of lube.

08:58.817 --> 09:00.985
Well, what were you even doing
at that bachelor party?

09:01.020 --> 09:02.453
Derek thought I was a guy,

09:02.487 --> 09:04.422
and I didn't want to ruin
what was happening between us.

09:06.375 --> 09:08.626
God, I wish my first roommate
hadn't died of old age.

09:08.661 --> 09:10.878
Then you wouldn't have moved in,
and I wouldn't have wasted

09:10.930 --> 09:12.380
15 years of my life trying
to make you

09:12.431 --> 09:13.932
feel better about yourself.

09:13.966 --> 09:15.099
'Cause guess what?

09:15.134 --> 09:18.269
The back of your neck
does look weird.

09:18.304 --> 09:19.704
Why would you say that?

09:19.738 --> 09:24.776
You know I can't see it.

09:24.810 --> 09:27.061
Oh, forget it.

09:27.112 --> 09:28.279
I don't need you, Liz.

09:28.314 --> 09:30.231
I have real friends now,

09:30.282 --> 09:34.118
celebrity friends who understand
what I'm going through.

09:34.153 --> 09:35.954
You see? Charlie from
<i>Charlie bit my finger</i>

09:35.988 --> 09:38.122
and Knob Kardashian
just texted me.

09:38.157 --> 09:39.724
They're my new besties.

09:39.758 --> 09:41.159
Well,
I don't need you either.

09:41.193 --> 09:43.127
I've got a new bestie too,
and her name is something cool,

09:43.162 --> 09:45.997
like Sam, and she does
web design, maybe,

09:46.031 --> 09:47.699
and I haven't met her yet.

09:47.733 --> 09:50.251
Look out, New York,
Liz Lemon is 41,

09:50.302 --> 09:54.038
covered in paint, and looking
for a new best friend.

09:58.870 --> 10:00.399
Kenneth, you're a hard worker,

10:00.400 --> 10:03.354
and I will find you something
else here at the company.

10:03.440 --> 10:06.091
Not interested, sir.

10:06.126 --> 10:07.827
I don't want to work for
an organization

10:07.861 --> 10:10.079
that would throw away
a tradition

10:10.113 --> 10:11.430
like the page program.

10:11.465 --> 10:15.668
Think of all the famous people
who started as pages:

10:15.702 --> 10:18.237
Steve Allen, Regis Philbin,

10:18.255 --> 10:22.374
Ted Bundy, Richard Ramirez,
John Wayne gacy...

10:22.408 --> 10:23.709
Kenneth, I'm sorry.

10:23.743 --> 10:26.195
But progress means eliminating
useless institutions.

10:26.229 --> 10:29.348
Well, Mr. Donaghy, there's one
thing you haven't thought of.

10:29.382 --> 10:32.952
Who will give the NBC tours?

10:32.986 --> 10:34.687
No machine can repla...

10:34.721 --> 10:37.122
We're calling
it "notkenneth."

10:37.157 --> 10:39.859
It's hard not to take
that personally, sir.

10:39.893 --> 10:41.760
We've inputted the entire page
handbook

10:41.778 --> 10:43.445
into notkenneth's database.

10:43.480 --> 10:45.931
It knows everything you know,
and more.

10:45.949 --> 10:48.334
Why, Jack, why?

10:48.368 --> 10:51.220
<i>"Why Jack why?" 
is a 2002 episode of Will and Grace,</i>

10:51.254 --> 10:54.706
<i>in which Jack, Sean Hayes,
chooses between two YMCAs.</i>

10:54.724 --> 10:55.908
<i>Featuring guest stars...</i>

10:55.942 --> 10:59.345
Daniel Day-Lewis as gay
benchpress guy.

11:04.317 --> 11:06.385
Hey, Sue.

11:06.419 --> 11:08.237
What are you up to tonight?

11:08.271 --> 11:09.822
I'm not working late again.

11:09.856 --> 11:10.823
Why don't you write
the show yourself?

11:10.857 --> 11:12.441
You take all the credit anyway.

11:12.492 --> 11:13.759
I hope you dream of your death.

11:13.793 --> 11:16.362
I was just wondering if you
wanted to go to a movie?

11:16.396 --> 11:19.698
Oh. I can't.
I have to work late.

11:24.638 --> 11:27.373
Hey, Hank.

11:27.407 --> 11:29.508
I didn't think I was going to
see you until dinner tonight.

11:29.543 --> 11:31.777
Whatever.

11:31.811 --> 11:32.978
I don't even know if I'm coming.

11:33.013 --> 11:34.813
Hank, is something wrong?

11:34.848 --> 11:39.451
Jack, I bought this company
a year ago today.

11:39.469 --> 11:40.786
Now, maybe I'm old-fashioned,

11:40.820 --> 11:43.322
but where I come from,
anniversaries mean something.

11:43.356 --> 11:45.858
Hank, of course I remembered
our "businessversary."

11:45.892 --> 11:47.159
I sent a gift.

11:47.193 --> 11:50.596
Oh, really?
Was it invisible?

11:50.630 --> 11:53.098
Sorry.

11:53.132 --> 11:54.934
I drove all the way
up here from Philadelphia

11:54.968 --> 11:56.468
listening to Garrison Keillor

11:56.486 --> 11:58.771
and just getting psyched
for a fun day.

11:58.805 --> 12:01.640
I used our new messenger
system and sent the gift

12:01.658 --> 12:04.276
to your office
on the 60th floor.

12:04.311 --> 12:07.413
Ah, it didn't go to 60,
it went to 6.

12:07.447 --> 12:09.915
What's on 6?

12:09.950 --> 12:11.116
Oh, no!

12:14.371 --> 12:17.089
Hey, how does
an adult make new friends?

12:17.123 --> 12:18.457
I don't have time
for this.

12:18.491 --> 12:21.176
Hank Hooper's businessversary
gift went to <i>TGS.</i>

12:21.211 --> 12:24.663
<i>TGS</i> is a sketch show known for
popular characters like...

12:24.681 --> 12:28.634
Error. Error. Error. Error.

12:33.673 --> 12:35.190
Stop! Nerds, stop.

12:35.225 --> 12:36.341
Stop what you are
doing immediately.

12:36.359 --> 12:37.893
Toofer, put that glass down.

12:37.944 --> 12:40.145
That scotch fountain obviously
was not meant for you.

12:40.179 --> 12:42.514
Phillie phanatic,
get away from him.

12:48.538 --> 12:50.823
None of this was meant for you.

12:50.857 --> 12:52.858
That should have been obvious,
since a gift from me

12:52.876 --> 12:55.094
would suggest that you
were producing good work.

12:55.128 --> 12:58.664
You are not.

12:58.698 --> 13:01.300
Lance Ito, you're
out of order.

13:01.334 --> 13:05.137
Line!

13:07.007 --> 13:09.975
This was meant
to go to the 60th floor.

13:10.010 --> 13:11.543
It's not their fault.

13:11.561 --> 13:13.679
It says 6th floor
on the invoice.

13:13.713 --> 13:15.547
Must be a computer error.

13:15.565 --> 13:17.650
Well, somebody made a mistake.

13:17.684 --> 13:19.218
A dumb mistake.

13:19.252 --> 13:22.855
And it wasn't the pages,
and it wasn't the computer...

13:22.889 --> 13:24.222
Ha! It was Jack!

13:24.240 --> 13:26.492
Guys, Jack makes dumb mistakes.

13:26.526 --> 13:27.726
He's just like us.

13:27.744 --> 13:29.194
He's no better than I am.

13:29.229 --> 13:30.663
He's just got a suit.

13:30.697 --> 13:32.931
No, no,
I am better than you, Lutz.

13:32.966 --> 13:35.250
Someone else is to blame, and I
will find him or,

13:35.285 --> 13:37.536
more likely, her.

13:37.570 --> 13:40.005
He looks scared, like Lutz
on an escalator.

13:40.040 --> 13:42.107
Twinsies!

13:46.579 --> 13:50.015
I called the paps earlier,
and they sent Lester.

13:50.050 --> 13:51.750
No one ever uses him.

13:51.768 --> 13:54.186
Ugh. I'd like
to bite his finger.

13:54.220 --> 13:57.406
Charlie.

13:57.440 --> 13:58.691
Sweetie,

13:58.725 --> 14:00.559
you look amazing.

14:02.245 --> 14:03.662
Knob Kardashian,

14:03.697 --> 14:05.063
Charlie bit my finger,

14:05.081 --> 14:06.415
this is mankind.

14:06.449 --> 14:09.368
And this, is Mr. Socko.

14:09.402 --> 14:12.070
Oh, I know Mr. Socko.

14:15.408 --> 14:17.092
Honey, I don't think
that was Madame Bovary,

14:17.127 --> 14:20.429
I think it was Madame Ovary.

14:20.463 --> 14:24.383
Oh, no, you went there.

14:24.417 --> 14:26.752
Man, do my feet hurt
in heels sometimes,

14:26.770 --> 14:28.454
and other things
that women talk about.

14:28.488 --> 14:29.722
Can we help you?

14:29.756 --> 14:31.757
Sorry, I'm just trying

14:31.791 --> 14:32.858
to make a new best friend.

14:32.892 --> 14:37.062
Oh, sweetie, honey, oh.

14:37.096 --> 14:40.149
Yeah, it's really hard.

14:40.200 --> 14:41.433
I mean, how did you guys
meet each other?

14:41.468 --> 14:43.368
We were at karaoke,

14:43.403 --> 14:44.770
and we all picked the same song.

14:44.788 --> 14:46.371
And then when the song came up,

14:46.406 --> 14:48.624
we all went on stage.

14:48.658 --> 14:50.843
And everybody was like, "what?"

14:50.877 --> 14:51.877
And then we were like,

14:51.911 --> 14:54.947
<i>What you want?
Baby, I got it </i>

14:54.981 --> 14:57.299
Shut up!
That's horrible.

14:57.333 --> 14:58.517
But I get your point.

14:58.551 --> 15:00.252
I need to go somewhere
where someone like me

15:00.286 --> 15:01.920
would be hanging out.

15:01.955 --> 15:03.288
But where does Liz Lemon go

15:03.306 --> 15:05.591
when she's out on the town?

15:05.625 --> 15:09.294
To the Barnes & Noble bathroom.

15:11.014 --> 15:12.731
Occupied! God.

15:12.766 --> 15:15.367
I know it is.
By my new best friend.

15:21.903 --> 15:23.037
Hey there, Jack.

15:23.071 --> 15:25.306
That Jenna Maroney
sure is a hoot.

15:25.340 --> 15:26.674
I didn't care for Mr. Socko.

15:26.708 --> 15:28.909
In my day, socks just
kept their mouth shut.

15:28.944 --> 15:30.995
Well, Hank, you'll be
interested to know

15:31.029 --> 15:33.948
I'm getting to the bottom of
our little gift mix-up earlier.

15:33.982 --> 15:35.116
Really, Jack?

15:35.150 --> 15:37.351
There's a problem
with the computer system

15:37.386 --> 15:39.620
where it confuses 6 and 60?

15:39.654 --> 15:41.822
I don't like your tone,
Rossitano.

15:41.857 --> 15:43.657
Aw, it's okay.
You messed up, buddy.

15:43.675 --> 15:44.658
Lutz, don't touch me.

15:44.693 --> 15:46.093
Hang on, Jack.

15:46.128 --> 15:48.462
Are these two very
ill children saying

15:48.497 --> 15:49.697
you messed up the delivery?

15:49.731 --> 15:50.831
That's unacceptable.

15:50.849 --> 15:52.032
Hey, we all make mistakes.

15:52.067 --> 15:56.370
Like farting when you're
talking to three people.

15:56.405 --> 15:58.906
No, a mistake is something
a man does,

15:58.940 --> 16:00.474
like going to war without
a reason,

16:00.508 --> 16:02.042
or executing a simpleton.

16:02.077 --> 16:03.344
What Jack did

16:03.378 --> 16:06.697
is a "whoopsie-daisy,"
like a baby or a woman would do.

16:06.731 --> 16:08.566
No, no, Hank.
It wasn't me,

16:08.617 --> 16:10.034
it was the machines.

16:10.068 --> 16:11.619
Tell him it wasn't my fault.

16:11.653 --> 16:14.071
<i>My fault,</i> a short-lived NBC
game show in which homeless

16:14.122 --> 16:17.691
people won money by confessing
to crimes they didn't commit.

16:20.095 --> 16:21.528
Damn you.

16:21.546 --> 16:24.882
<i>Dam you.</i> A beaver goes to
college in this 1987 anima...

16:24.916 --> 16:27.301
Okay, who wants
to see the red band trailer

16:27.335 --> 16:28.586
of <i>Martin Luther King day?</i>

16:28.637 --> 16:30.905
No, we need to decide which
cell phone pictures

16:30.939 --> 16:32.372
I'm going to leak.

16:32.390 --> 16:34.842
Everyone, listen to Charlie
bit my finger's new song.

16:34.876 --> 16:36.210
<i>I'm rotten
to the core mother...</i>

16:36.228 --> 16:37.561
Quiet!

16:37.596 --> 16:40.781
Mankind is trying to tweet about
these clowns in Congress.

16:40.816 --> 16:41.816
Excuse me, guys.

16:41.850 --> 16:43.184
We're not doing your things,

16:43.218 --> 16:44.435
we're doing my me things.

16:44.486 --> 16:46.020
You mean me, right?

16:46.054 --> 16:47.021
Me.

16:47.055 --> 16:48.255
- Me?
- You're all using

16:48.290 --> 16:49.890
that word wrong.

16:49.925 --> 16:50.891
- I'm me.
- I'm me.

16:56.308 --> 16:59.664
Uhh! I hate it when they put the movie
poster on the cover of the book

16:59.778 --> 17:01.410
that the movie is based on.

17:01.497 --> 17:04.182
Let me imagine what Peeta
Mellark looks like,

17:04.200 --> 17:06.951
and how his arms smell of bread.

17:06.986 --> 17:08.219
Amy, this is great.

17:08.253 --> 17:09.753
We are going to be best friends.

17:09.789 --> 17:12.089
Where should we get dinner?

17:12.124 --> 17:14.526
I don't trust Sushi,
Mexican gives me gas,

17:14.560 --> 17:16.361
and I already had
a bloomin' onion today.

17:16.395 --> 17:17.796
Me too.

17:17.829 --> 17:18.782
Also, Ethiopian is out,

17:18.784 --> 17:21.598
because I don't want to see a man
with a beard eat with his hands.

17:21.634 --> 17:23.635
And nothing family style.

17:23.669 --> 17:25.368
Ah! Why is family
a selling point?

17:25.387 --> 17:26.805
Look at the state
of the American family.

17:26.839 --> 17:30.842
Not something we'll ever have
to worry about at our age.

17:30.876 --> 17:33.678
I saw a headline about those
amoebas that eat your brain,

17:33.712 --> 17:35.246
but I didn't read the article.

17:35.281 --> 17:37.315
Well, you didn't have time.
Our lives are half-over.

17:37.349 --> 17:38.716
Our mothers lied to us.

17:38.734 --> 17:41.385
Hey, you can't ride a
bike on the sidewalk.

17:41.403 --> 17:43.721
Oh, my God, I am starving.

17:43.739 --> 17:45.990
We have been wandering
around for...

17:46.025 --> 17:48.827
10 minutes?

17:48.861 --> 17:49.828
Oh, brother.

17:49.862 --> 17:53.448
Hanging out
with me is awful.

17:53.499 --> 17:56.468
Amy, we can't both be the
negative, judgmental one.

17:56.502 --> 17:57.619
So what? I'm just supposed
to sit around

17:57.670 --> 17:59.137
and listen to you complain?

17:59.171 --> 18:02.307
No. You're supposed to be
so vacant and self-absorbed

18:02.341 --> 18:06.311
that you just let me
vent without piling on.

18:06.345 --> 18:09.097
I need Jenna.

18:09.131 --> 18:11.716
I need Steffi.

18:14.687 --> 18:17.455
They say people
who kill themselves

18:17.490 --> 18:19.891
never regret it.

18:19.925 --> 18:21.809
Tracy.
Tracy, stop.

18:21.861 --> 18:23.628
I found something
for you to live for.

18:23.662 --> 18:25.997
I already have a room full
of old black women.

18:26.031 --> 18:29.567
No, Tray, this is Celia
Monroe, from Celia's bakery.

18:29.602 --> 18:31.836
She lives in a nursing home
on Long Island now.

18:31.871 --> 18:33.872
We're all
sleeping with Carl,

18:33.906 --> 18:37.208
because he has
the most puzzles.

18:37.243 --> 18:39.477
But we tracked her down, and she
baked you a banana cream pie, see?

18:39.512 --> 18:40.979
That's something
you didn't have.

18:41.013 --> 18:43.414
So that means there must be
other things I don't have.

18:43.449 --> 18:44.782
Other reasons to live.

18:44.817 --> 18:46.184
You guys must have went through

18:46.218 --> 18:47.619
a lot of trouble
to show me that.

18:47.653 --> 18:48.987
You must have been upset.

18:49.021 --> 18:50.522
And I know how that feels,

18:50.556 --> 18:51.823
because I've been upset.

18:51.857 --> 18:54.392
I was very upset when you put
"no presents" on my

18:54.426 --> 18:56.127
birthday invitations.

18:56.161 --> 18:57.629
That's what this was about?

18:57.663 --> 18:59.981
Why didn't you just tell us
back in your dressing room?

19:00.015 --> 19:02.400
Because showing
is better than telling,

19:02.434 --> 19:06.688
and my schedule
is light this week.

19:06.739 --> 19:08.806
Thank you.

19:22.855 --> 19:25.189
I never should have treated you
the way I did, Liz.

19:25.224 --> 19:27.825
I need someone who has so little
going on in their life,

19:27.860 --> 19:29.494
she lets me get
all the attention.

19:29.528 --> 19:30.828
And I need someone in my life

19:30.863 --> 19:32.964
who doesn't listen
to a word I say.

19:32.998 --> 19:35.383
Thank you,
I just got it cut.

19:46.946 --> 19:49.063
I was wrong.

19:49.114 --> 19:50.181
I do need you.

19:50.215 --> 19:52.550
You had me at
"I was wrong, I do need."

19:52.585 --> 19:53.985
I can replace just
about everything you do,

19:54.019 --> 19:57.422
but no machine could ever
be the human wastebasket

19:57.456 --> 19:59.490
that I dump
my stupid mistakes into.

19:59.525 --> 20:02.360
Dump, sir.
Dump all over me.

20:02.394 --> 20:04.528
You thumb with a wig,

20:04.546 --> 20:06.697
those gifts were supposed
to go to the 60th floor.

20:06.715 --> 20:08.566
I'm sorry, sir.
It was all my fault.

20:08.601 --> 20:11.803
Good job, Jack.
Blame it on an albino.

20:11.837 --> 20:13.871
Classic,
'cause it works.

20:17.426 --> 20:20.544
I can never replace you guys.

20:20.562 --> 20:22.063
I love you, presents!

20:22.097 --> 20:24.682
Ooh.
I have that.

20:25.516 --> 20:27.285
And that.

20:29.086 --> 20:30.405
Oh!

20:30.439 --> 20:32.240
I've already got this.

20:32.274 --> 20:36.294
Oh, my goodness.

20:36.328 --> 20:38.329
I already have this.

20:38.364 --> 20:40.465
I definitely
don't need that.
