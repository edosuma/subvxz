WEBVTT

00:02.078 --> 00:05.072
We're going to Santa Barbara
to pick up the bassinet.

00:05.160 --> 00:07.959
Or we can save five hours and go
around the corner to Baby Town.

00:08.080 --> 00:09.914
What are you doing all day?
Jay!

00:10.002 --> 00:12.881
- It's fine, Mom.
- No, it's not fine. Today's Manny's birthday.

00:12.963 --> 00:14.523
Aw, geez. I'm sorry, kid.

00:14.603 --> 00:17.599
Don't worry. Reuben's family's
taking me for a birthday lunch.

00:17.685 --> 00:20.121
You see?
Even the Reubens remembered.

00:20.206 --> 00:24.123
We'll be back at 6:00, and we're taking
you to a special birthday dinner, okay?

00:24.248 --> 00:25.524
We are?
Jay!

00:25.609 --> 00:27.043
I'm sorry, kid.

00:27.130 --> 00:29.247
I wasn't sorry.
It was a setup.

00:29.331 --> 00:32.086
We're throwing him a big
surprise birthday party.

00:32.171 --> 00:34.973
And he totally fell for
it, the little jerk.

00:35.053 --> 00:37.728
I mean, that's the whole
point of a surprise party.

00:37.814 --> 00:39.336
You take someone who
you really love...

00:39.375 --> 00:41.050
and you play him like a fool.

00:41.136 --> 00:43.493
That's not the whole point
of all this.

00:43.578 --> 00:45.570
Manny has been feeling
a little bit neglected,

00:45.659 --> 00:48.539
and I wanted to give him
the most special day.

00:48.621 --> 00:51.899
This is the last birthday that it's
only going to be the three of us.

00:51.982 --> 00:53.736
I can't wait to see
the little dope's face.

00:54.864 --> 00:56.982
And then that smug
Carol Chu was all,

00:57.064 --> 00:59.105
"You can't dig without
an environment impact study."

00:59.145 --> 01:01.820
And then I was like, "Bam!" And I
slapped the study onto Charlie's desk,

01:01.907 --> 01:03.421
and Carol was like,
"But-But-But"-

01:03.507 --> 01:05.420
And then I was like,
"Chew on that!"

01:05.509 --> 01:07.189
- You said that?
- Well, not with my mouth.

01:07.230 --> 01:09.586
With my eyes and my swivel.

01:09.671 --> 01:11.708
So how was your day at work?

01:11.831 --> 01:13.471
Oh, you know, fine.

01:13.552 --> 01:15.943
Okay. Yeah?

01:16.034 --> 01:19.632
I'm an idiot. I know Cam's been struggling
since he went back to teaching.

01:19.716 --> 01:22.755
The students, the faculty-
none of it's clicking.

01:22.877 --> 01:27.316
The last thing he needed was me going
on about my latest work triumph.

01:27.398 --> 01:29.277
And then it got worse.

01:29.359 --> 01:32.081
Come on, Daddy.
It's time for our wedding.

01:32.162 --> 01:34.723
- What's happening?
- Oh, Lily and I are gettin' married.

01:34.802 --> 01:36.476
Uh, what's happening?

01:36.564 --> 01:38.477
When she proposed,
I thought it was a little weird,

01:38.565 --> 01:40.955
but then I read it's a phase
that some girls go through, so-

01:41.046 --> 01:43.242
Oh, no. Well, I just think
it's the cutest thing ever.

01:43.327 --> 01:45.603
Here, Dad.
I made you this ring.

01:45.688 --> 01:47.247
Oh.
Oh.

01:47.329 --> 01:50.129
Cute, cute, cute, cute,
cute, cute, cute!

01:50.209 --> 01:51.644
Do you have a ring for me?

01:51.731 --> 01:54.042
Well, Lily, it wouldn't be
a wedding without a ring.

01:54.172 --> 01:57.564
Yay! Yay. Loving this!

01:57.694 --> 02:00.688
Daddy, move. Okay. I guess I'll
just go sit on the groom's side.

02:00.775 --> 02:02.653
Oh, come on, Cam.
It's fun.

02:02.737 --> 02:05.411
Oh, it's fun.
It's-It's super fun!

02:05.497 --> 02:07.569
You finally got married!
Hooray!

02:07.658 --> 02:10.253
- Ow!
- Oh, are you okay, sweetie?

02:10.340 --> 02:13.062
What do you think?

Manny's birthday. Mom!

02:38.153 --> 02:40.191
Alex, give it back
to your bro-

02:40.274 --> 02:41.709
Oh, sorry. I tried to care.

02:41.834 --> 02:44.236
Ugh! But this is everything I
made at the boutique last week.

02:44.317 --> 02:46.514
I'm not gonna have any money left for me.
Should've thought of that...

02:46.638 --> 02:48.231
before you got thrown
out of school.

02:48.319 --> 02:50.277
- You live here, you pay rent.
- You used to be fun.

02:50.360 --> 02:52.671
You used to be-What?
Oh, yeah, at college.

02:52.761 --> 02:54.240
Uh, hang on. Wait.

02:54.322 --> 02:56.962
Gloria says that we are
surprising Manny at 6:00 tonight,

02:57.043 --> 03:00.037
but she wants us there at 4:00, which
means she's expecting us to do the setup.

03:00.123 --> 03:01.922
- I say we leave here around 5:00.
- Great.

03:03.685 --> 03:05.804
That's Kenny from work.
Oh, I'll get it.

03:05.887 --> 03:08.649
We're going to a street fair, so we'll
just meet you guys at the party.

03:08.688 --> 03:11.364
Oh. You've been spending a lot of
time with this Kenny from work.

03:11.450 --> 03:13.283
- Stop it right now.
- Is it gettin' romantic?

03:13.410 --> 03:15.290
N-
Yeah-

03:15.372 --> 03:17.603
- Well-
- Yeah-

03:17.692 --> 03:19.173
Oh!

03:19.253 --> 03:21.814
Mom, this is Kenny.
And Dad you already met.

03:21.895 --> 03:24.616
Uh, yeah. First of all, Kenny,
sick ponytail.

03:24.735 --> 03:28.048
- Uh. Thanks, man.
- Kenny designs jeans for our boutique.

03:28.177 --> 03:30.090
Uh-huh. That reminds
me, I got something for you.

03:30.178 --> 03:32.775
- What are you, a 32, 34?
- What are you, 36, 38?

03:32.900 --> 03:35.018
What are you, in my mind?
Put 'em on your body.

03:35.140 --> 03:37.577
Will do. Will do.
Phil, honey-Uh-

03:37.663 --> 03:39.894
Kenny is kind of a big deal.

03:39.983 --> 03:41.977
- Mm-hmm.
- What does that fashion Web site call you again?

03:42.065 --> 03:44.057
A "jeanius."
Spelled like "jeans."

03:44.185 --> 03:45.539
Oh.
Mortifying.

03:45.626 --> 03:47.777
And a "rack star." Oh.

03:47.867 --> 03:49.348
And what was
the headline again?

03:49.427 --> 03:50.703
Oh, yeah. "He's Denimite."

03:50.828 --> 03:53.470
What an embarrassing week
you've been having. Ooh, yeah.

03:53.549 --> 03:55.827
I'm just trying to stay
fresh creatively, you know?

03:55.911 --> 03:57.550
Made my bones in men's apparel,

03:57.632 --> 03:59.670
and now I'm working
with these local boutiques-

03:59.752 --> 04:01.234
just trying to get
into girls' jeans.

04:01.313 --> 04:03.307
- Phil!
- There's no Phil here.

04:03.395 --> 04:06.947
These jeans just slipped on me so
perfectly, my name must be Pantsarella.

04:07.036 --> 04:08.870
Boom!
Comfortable, right?

04:08.958 --> 04:10.398
Like a diaper.

04:10.518 --> 04:12.032
Well, we should get going.
Oh, yeah?

04:12.119 --> 04:14.315
Um, but you wanted to say...
something.

04:14.439 --> 04:16.238
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sorry. Yes. Okay.

04:16.320 --> 04:18.755
Uh, listen.

04:18.843 --> 04:21.755
You made it seem like
you had jeans for both of us,

04:21.844 --> 04:24.154
and Claire hasn't
gotten hers yet, so-

04:24.324 --> 04:26.318
I am so sorry.
Don't worry about it.

04:26.405 --> 04:29.002
Here you go.

04:29.128 --> 04:30.642
Enjoy. Kenny, you're amazing.

04:30.767 --> 04:32.090
No, man, you're amazing.
Have fun.

04:32.129 --> 04:36.330
I love him.

04:36.410 --> 04:37.891
Phil!
You think he liked me?

04:38.011 --> 04:41.245
Phil! That is a date.
They're going on a date.

04:41.373 --> 04:43.735
What? He's practically my age. Okay.
Uh, yeah. Right, right.

04:43.855 --> 04:45.574
And what middle-aged guy
would be interested...

04:45.655 --> 04:48.252
in a young, attractive,
newly legal woman?

04:48.336 --> 04:49.818
Oh, that's right.
All of them.

04:49.897 --> 04:51.172
That's not true.
I wouldn't.

04:51.258 --> 04:53.648
Really?
Hermione Granger?

04:53.778 --> 04:56.090
What?
Mm-hmm.

04:56.181 --> 04:58.252
I'm just a Harry Potter fan.
Yeah.

04:58.341 --> 05:00.857
Has she blossomed into a
lovely young lady? Yes, but-

05:00.943 --> 05:02.935
Luke, I'm never
telling you anything!

05:04.505 --> 05:06.622
Oh, my God, Jay!
Look how beautiful.

05:06.706 --> 05:08.308
Look at this.
But the bookstore is empty.

05:08.387 --> 05:10.619
That's why China's
kicking our ass.

05:10.708 --> 05:13.588
- Thirty-three!
- Ay, no. Fifty-nine.

05:13.668 --> 05:15.626
We're so late, and we still
have to pick up the drinks.

05:15.710 --> 05:17.271
Excuse me. I'm terribly sorry.
Excuse me.

05:17.311 --> 05:18.791
Sir? This is
my cake right here.

05:18.872 --> 05:20.705
How about I just leave
money, I take it?

05:20.792 --> 05:24.423
- If I did that for you, I'd have to do it for everyone.
- Not if you just did it for me.

05:24.553 --> 05:26.227
Thirty-three!
Excuse me.

05:26.315 --> 05:30.356
Excuse me. Hmm. We're in a hurry.
We have a birthday party.

05:30.436 --> 05:33.272
Why didn't you say something? We
don't see many of those around here.

05:33.358 --> 05:35.510
You think you can intimidate me
with that attitude?

05:35.640 --> 05:38.110
- What do I look like to you?
- Thirty-four!

05:38.201 --> 05:41.513
Thank you. But the point
is that my son is waiting-

05:41.643 --> 05:44.000
Gloria, it's not worth it. We don't
need these people. Jay, we need-

05:44.084 --> 05:45.677
Come on.
We'll get a better cake.

05:45.765 --> 05:47.198
Are you crazy?
How are we gonna-

05:47.285 --> 05:50.200
I've got it covered.
Excuse me, miss?

05:50.326 --> 05:51.841
I'm sorry I raised
my voice in there,

05:51.927 --> 05:53.168
especially in front
of the baby.

05:53.247 --> 05:54.683
I know how delicate
they can be.

05:54.769 --> 05:56.523
Oh, you're so nice to say that.

05:56.650 --> 05:58.324
But, you know, they're
sturdier than you think. Yeah.

05:58.411 --> 06:01.371
- In fact, every day I learn these little-
- Yeah, take care now.

06:04.774 --> 06:06.003
Hey, honey.

06:06.134 --> 06:07.932
Daddy, what's in the bag?

06:08.014 --> 06:09.211
Oh, it's a present for Manny.

06:09.296 --> 06:11.128
And I also got your other
daddy a little something...

06:11.217 --> 06:12.697
'cause he's been
feeling down today.

06:12.817 --> 06:14.969
- How's your eye, sweetie?
- Oh, it's fine. It's just a scratch.

06:15.099 --> 06:18.457
Let's go this way, honey. Oh, Cam, are
you wearing a suit to Manny's birth-

06:18.541 --> 06:19.769
Oh, wow.

06:19.861 --> 06:21.614
Okay. Let's get
your hospital band off.

06:21.742 --> 06:24.053
I like it. Okay, that can be
your "something blue" then.

06:24.142 --> 06:25.736
Cam?

06:25.864 --> 06:28.221
Daddy, I wanna drive my car.
A car? Oh. A car.

06:28.305 --> 06:30.582
Just a second, sweetie.
Okay.

06:30.666 --> 06:32.545
Does anyone know a reason
why these two shouldn't be wed?

06:32.626 --> 06:35.667
- She is my wife.
- Okay, so by the power vested in me...

06:35.749 --> 06:37.820
- by the State of Candy Land-
- And Utah.

06:37.910 --> 06:39.743
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

06:39.830 --> 06:42.187
Daddy, I wanna play
with my car right now.

06:42.271 --> 06:43.753
Okay. Of course.
Yes, sweetie.

06:43.832 --> 06:46.475
But remember, we have to walk down
the receiving line.

06:46.513 --> 06:48.904
Oh. Oh, what a turnout.

06:50.756 --> 06:52.191
There she goes.

06:52.317 --> 06:55.435
You got her a car? I can't help it
that you skimped on your wedding.

06:55.518 --> 06:57.271
Okay, look, I know what's
underneath all this, all right?

06:57.358 --> 07:00.354
Right now, in your life,
you're feeling, you know, very-

07:00.441 --> 07:03.914
No. Please do not turn me marrying
my daughter into something ugly.

07:04.003 --> 07:05.561
Lily is having
the time of her-

07:05.642 --> 07:08.955
Ow!

07:09.044 --> 07:11.162
- Cam!
- Oh, please. Do not blame me.

07:11.285 --> 07:13.118
We always knew there was a strong
possibility-

07:13.207 --> 07:14.722
She'd be a terrible driver.

07:18.729 --> 07:20.961
I know we're running late, Claire.
We'll be there soon.

07:21.050 --> 07:23.611
Just start setting up. What do
you mean, "Surprise, surprise"?

07:23.731 --> 07:26.454
Ay. Hang on. I've gotta go.
You take care.

07:26.574 --> 07:28.485
What's the matter? Jay, I can't
find the parking ticket!

07:28.614 --> 07:30.812
Calm down. Everything's gonna be fine.

07:30.975 --> 07:32.729
Good. It's a male attendant.
What does that mean?

07:32.817 --> 07:35.651
How would you get out of this
situation if I wasn't here?

07:35.737 --> 07:38.334
- Mmm!
- Hey, pal, my housekeeper forgot her ticket.

07:38.418 --> 07:42.016
You're going to need to back up, go up to
the third level and find the pay station.

07:42.100 --> 07:44.935
Ay, you can't just let us go?

07:45.023 --> 07:48.300
I know I put it somewhere here,
but I cannot find it now.

07:48.383 --> 07:50.455
Pay station, third level.

07:50.544 --> 07:52.343
Maybe you can let us go now,

07:52.466 --> 07:54.743
and then next time
I do you two times?

07:54.827 --> 07:57.469
The only way you're going to get out
is to go back to the pay station.

07:57.548 --> 07:59.461
Actually, there is another way.

08:01.951 --> 08:03.624
- Ah!
- You okay?

08:03.751 --> 08:06.221
Let's drive through something else!

08:06.312 --> 08:09.431
The gala celebration
is only minutes away.

08:09.513 --> 08:12.553
Delectable refreshments,
excited classmates.

08:12.635 --> 08:15.708
And what's this?
The most beautiful sight of all.

08:15.797 --> 08:18.393
Go away!

08:18.479 --> 08:20.516
He's old. She's young.
It's gross.

08:20.600 --> 08:24.391
Honey, nothing's happening. Young people
seek out older mentors all the time.

08:24.482 --> 08:27.476
When I was 17, I was really close
with my friend Stacy's mom.

08:27.603 --> 08:29.561
Mrs. Robinson was
a former cheerleader,

08:29.643 --> 08:31.841
so she knew just how to
massage my legs after practice.

08:31.965 --> 08:34.924
She had her own homemade Bengay that didn't
burn no matter where she rubbed it on me.

08:35.006 --> 08:37.284
If I had the chance to go over there,
I never missed an opportunity.

08:37.448 --> 08:39.246
I think maybe you did.

08:39.369 --> 08:41.441
Oh, I forgot the present
in the car.

08:41.529 --> 08:44.044
Oh. All right. I'm gonna go take
a squirt while you grab it.

08:44.130 --> 08:45.929
Oh, my God. Hey!

08:46.011 --> 08:47.208
I know!
Just-

08:47.292 --> 08:48.488
It's crazy!

08:48.573 --> 08:49.690
Mmm.
Mmm.

08:53.736 --> 08:55.251
I'm gonna fight him.
Phil.

08:55.337 --> 08:57.932
No, Claire, I'm gonna
fight him up real nice.

08:58.057 --> 09:00.335
How about you start with a threat?

09:00.459 --> 09:03.299
Oh, hey, Claire. Um, could you help me with this?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

09:03.340 --> 09:04.775
You gotta go around
the other side.

09:04.900 --> 09:06.780
I need to keep my eyes on Phil.
Ooh, what's happening?

09:06.862 --> 09:08.820
He's about to drop the hammer
on Haley's new boyfriend.

09:08.902 --> 09:10.895
He's twice her age,
and it's disgusting.

09:11.023 --> 09:14.019
Reminds me of a certain manager at the
Cheesecake Factory that you dated.

09:14.106 --> 09:17.258
Oh, Todd. He had a Camaro...
and power.

09:17.347 --> 09:20.227
Ugh! He was nasty. You just did
it to get a rise out of Dad.

09:20.349 --> 09:21.828
Yeah, well, look how well
that worked out.

09:21.908 --> 09:24.187
It didn't bother Dad at all, and
then I was stuck with a guy...

09:24.310 --> 09:26.143
who smelled like potato skins
and said "supposably."

09:26.272 --> 09:28.628
You have to admit, Dad played
that pretty brilliantly.

09:28.713 --> 09:31.751
After a few weeks, you got bored
with him and then you dumped him.

09:31.874 --> 09:35.710
I did. I dumped him up real nice.
Mm-hmm.

09:35.795 --> 09:37.310
Phil.
Claire-Oh, come on.

09:37.397 --> 09:39.037
Phil, you can't
say anything to Kenny.

09:39.118 --> 09:40.108
What?
No.

09:40.197 --> 09:41.678
I know why Haley is doing this.

09:41.759 --> 09:44.275
She's doing it to get back at
you for being so hard on her.

09:44.400 --> 09:47.200
I did the same thing to my dad.
First of all, I'm not your dad.

09:47.321 --> 09:49.837
And do you think I'm just gonna
let this happen? Trust me.

09:49.922 --> 09:52.279
The more it bothers you,
the longer he stays.

09:52.364 --> 09:54.357
The more we ignore it-

09:54.444 --> 09:56.402
Hey. Up top, Dad.

09:58.647 --> 10:00.798
Yeah!
Nailed it.

10:00.888 --> 10:04.088
The sooner Willie Nelson's
on the road again.

10:04.169 --> 10:05.810
I'm so conflicted.

10:05.891 --> 10:08.811
What you're saying makes sense up here,
but it's not what I wanna do here.

10:08.892 --> 10:12.045
And I just feel so damn comfortable
down here.

10:12.173 --> 10:14.212
I forgot to tell you,
I put that in the trunk.

10:14.334 --> 10:16.453
Oh, I know. I had to reach
under your jeans. Uh-

10:16.536 --> 10:17.731
Ah!

10:17.816 --> 10:19.410
I can't believe that!
It's so crazy!

10:19.497 --> 10:21.730
It's adorable.
Mmm. Mmm.

10:21.858 --> 10:23.656
Wanna see outside?

10:23.739 --> 10:25.617
Yeah.

10:26.820 --> 10:28.938
- Sweetie, I brought you a cookie.
- Mmm.

10:29.022 --> 10:32.062
I ate at the emergency room.

10:32.183 --> 10:34.780
You worked that in seamlessly. Oh, come on.
It was-It was an accident.

10:34.864 --> 10:36.618
Stop beating yourself up.
Hey, let's go mingle.

10:36.705 --> 10:39.147
No. You know what? Some of my
students are here, and I'm just-

10:39.226 --> 10:40.866
I'm not in the mood.
All right.

10:40.947 --> 10:43.065
Cam, we're gonna talk about this.
I know what's going on.

10:43.149 --> 10:44.823
You're obviously going through
something at school.

10:44.910 --> 10:47.790
You're struggling, and I have
just made things worse...

10:47.870 --> 10:50.387
by bragging about what a hero
I've been at work recently.

10:50.471 --> 10:52.465
And it's-it's not
a competition.

10:52.553 --> 10:54.545
You know, my victories
are your victories.

10:54.634 --> 10:56.916
- Your defeats are my defeats.
- Hey, Mr. Tucker!

10:58.556 --> 11:01.278
Bow
across a cello string

11:01.357 --> 11:03.748
Piano keys a-hammerin'

11:03.838 --> 11:07.880
Voices raised in harmony

11:07.960 --> 11:11.798
For our dear old Cameron

11:11.923 --> 11:13.801
We love you! We love you!
You're the best!

11:13.883 --> 11:15.478
Yeah.

11:15.565 --> 11:17.079
Yeah, it's been a nightmare.

11:17.165 --> 11:19.807
And thank you for assuming
I'm terrible at my job.

11:21.768 --> 11:23.566
No! Um-

11:24.488 --> 11:25.770
Hey, everybody.
Sorry we're late.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.528
We got caught doing
a bunch of stuff.

11:27.609 --> 11:29.249
Or not doing a bunch of stuff.

11:29.370 --> 11:32.923
Okay. Manny is going to be
here soon, so let's go over the plan.

11:33.012 --> 11:35.290
When we hear him coming,
we turn off the light.

11:35.373 --> 11:37.526
Then when he comes in
and turns it on,

11:37.614 --> 11:40.212
we all scream,
"Surprise!"

11:40.297 --> 11:41.936
You got a pen?
I wanna write this down.

11:42.096 --> 11:45.376
He's coming up the driveway.
He's here early. Hurry up!

11:47.300 --> 11:49.735
Hurry! Hurry!
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

11:50.942 --> 11:52.695
Quick. I don't want
the neighbors to see us.

11:52.823 --> 11:55.180
- You sure we're alone?
- Yeah. They're not home till 6:00.

11:55.263 --> 11:58.018
Good. Because I want to
give you your birthday present.

12:01.827 --> 12:04.296
Actually,
I'd like to see your face.

12:05.628 --> 12:07.109
It's harsh, I know.

12:07.190 --> 12:08.704
I've begged them
to put in a dimmer.

12:08.790 --> 12:10.908
No.

12:12.031 --> 12:13.785
Surprise.

12:13.872 --> 12:16.229
Manny, we're so sorry.
We didn't mean to-

12:16.314 --> 12:18.465
What? Ruin the greatest moment
of my life?

12:18.555 --> 12:20.865
- Thanks again, Mom!
- ¡Ay!

12:20.956 --> 12:23.598
And the surprised
becomes the surpriser.

12:23.678 --> 12:26.398
This party had everything.

12:26.479 --> 12:27.994
Manny?

12:31.160 --> 12:32.755
Manny, please come out.

12:32.881 --> 12:35.877
Unless you're here to cut a food
slot on my door, you can leave now.

12:35.964 --> 12:38.480
Nobody's going
to make fun of you.

12:38.565 --> 12:40.558
Kids make fun of you
if you get a haircut.

12:40.686 --> 12:42.996
I just gave them
a full-blown sex scandal.

12:43.087 --> 12:46.320
No. Everybody's so excited
to celebrate with you.

12:46.408 --> 12:48.879
Ay, no.

12:48.970 --> 12:51.804
The baby was ready,
but I was not.

12:51.890 --> 12:55.363
It was bad enough that Manny
had to share his mother.

12:55.453 --> 12:58.367
I couldn't let him
share a birthday too.

12:58.495 --> 13:01.169
You stay in there! I thought
you wanted me to come out.

13:01.255 --> 13:02.896
I do! I do! Come out.

13:02.977 --> 13:05.857
We stole you a beautiful
birthday-cake.

13:05.937 --> 13:08.009
Gloria, tag out.
Let me give it a shot.

13:08.099 --> 13:11.093
Yes, you fix it.

13:11.180 --> 13:13.742
Look, I'm not gonna sugarcoat this, kid.
That was rough.

13:13.901 --> 13:16.974
Go away. But
there's an upside.

13:17.063 --> 13:20.216
The best thing about kissing a girl
is you get to tell your friends.

13:20.304 --> 13:22.342
The problem is,
they never believe you.

13:22.425 --> 13:23.906
But you had witnesses.

13:23.987 --> 13:27.060
We're gonna be talking
about this one for years to come.

13:27.147 --> 13:28.663
You've said it, Kenny.

13:28.749 --> 13:31.505
Manny seems to me like a-
like a real old soul.

13:31.591 --> 13:33.709
Kenny is amazing at
telling the age of a soul.

13:33.832 --> 13:35.585
Aw. Thanks, babe.
Oh.

13:37.113 --> 13:39.994
- Age is nothin' but a state of mind, you know?
- Yeah.

13:40.115 --> 13:42.790
I'm probably more of a 14-year-old
than he is, and-Mm-hmm.

13:42.876 --> 13:44.834
Believe me,
I know 14-year-olds.

13:44.956 --> 13:46.950
He has a 14-year-old daughter.
Oh, yeah.

13:47.037 --> 13:50.111
Oh, cool! Oh, honey, you don't have to do that.
They have a gardener.

13:51.919 --> 13:53.401
Trust me on this.

13:53.481 --> 13:57.874
I want to, but you're just so
wrong about so many things.

13:57.962 --> 13:59.682
- Just keep practicing.
- Okay.

13:59.803 --> 14:02.924
Hey, Cam, I-I'm so sorry
that I insulted you earlier.

14:03.006 --> 14:06.888
I thought that there was something going
on at work, and obviously I was wrong.

14:07.008 --> 14:09.842
Well, you're wrong again. It is about work.
This is a fun game.

14:09.928 --> 14:12.206
I didn't bring it up before
because I was embarrassed.

14:12.289 --> 14:15.841
But yesterday was the best day
I've had at work yet.

14:15.931 --> 14:18.243
I clicked with the students,
the teachers.

14:18.413 --> 14:20.848
I finally felt like I belonged.
Oh, I get it.

14:20.974 --> 14:24.127
You couldn't possibly get it. I'm in
the middle of my story. I'm sorry.

14:24.256 --> 14:27.967
Every day at 2:30 I call Lily,
and we dunk a cookie together.

14:28.057 --> 14:30.732
And yesterday...
I forgot.

14:31.979 --> 14:33.494
Forgot my own daughter.

14:34.580 --> 14:36.141
And obviously
she resents me for it.

14:36.221 --> 14:38.692
It's why she asked you to
marry her, to get back at me.

14:38.783 --> 14:42.334
Okay. Here I-I need to point out that she's
five and not a character from Dynasty.

14:42.425 --> 14:45.942
And as much as I try to connect with
her, I just keep making it worse.

14:46.027 --> 14:47.905
Maybe you're just
trying too hard.

14:47.987 --> 14:50.663
Everybody, come in! Manny's
coming-down.

14:50.749 --> 14:53.218
Somebody pick up that towel
before someone trips.

14:56.392 --> 14:59.067
Daddy! Okay! Daddy's coming!
What's wrong with me?

15:01.794 --> 15:03.309
Okay, everybody.

15:03.395 --> 15:07.676
So, we sing, then presents, then cake.
That's a Colombian tradition.

15:07.757 --> 15:10.876
And we do not speak
of what happened before.

15:10.958 --> 15:12.473
Nobody saw anything.

15:12.560 --> 15:14.040
That's another
Colombian tradition.

15:14.119 --> 15:16.921
Here he is,
the man of the hour!

15:17.081 --> 15:19.313
Happy

15:19.403 --> 15:20.918
Gloria, you okay?

15:21.003 --> 15:22.597
No, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

15:22.684 --> 15:25.406
Ha-
Aaah! Aaah!

15:25.485 --> 15:27.125
No way! She peed!

15:27.246 --> 15:29.284
Her water broke.

15:29.367 --> 15:31.883
So far,
14's not my favorite age.

15:31.968 --> 15:34.405
No, it's nothing.
Keep singing. Keep singing.

15:34.489 --> 15:36.402
Ha-¡Ay! Stop it!

15:36.531 --> 15:39.047
We're gonna pop on over to the hospital.
Pizza's on the way.

15:39.131 --> 15:41.125
You think about it,
run a mop over this area.

15:41.212 --> 15:43.205
Ay, Manny!
I'm so sorry, okay?

15:43.294 --> 15:46.572
And the birthday video
becomes a nature film.

15:46.656 --> 15:49.091
Luke! Come on.

15:49.256 --> 15:52.330
Oh, my gosh!
It's happening!

15:55.619 --> 15:58.500
Ay, Manny,
I am so sorry about today.

15:58.582 --> 16:00.699
I just wanted you
to have a happy birthday.

16:00.783 --> 16:02.979
And speaking of birth-
days-

16:03.064 --> 16:06.662
Don't listen to him. I'm not letting
this baby out before midnight.

16:06.745 --> 16:10.822
This is your day. I'm not gonna let
you share it every year, okay?

16:10.908 --> 16:12.468
Mom, look.

16:12.549 --> 16:15.065
Yeah, I've felt
a little neglected lately.

16:15.149 --> 16:17.302
But I've had you to myself
for 14 years.

16:17.390 --> 16:19.384
That makes me a little sad.

16:19.511 --> 16:22.152
Oh, please. If we had actually
forgotten his birthday,

16:22.232 --> 16:24.623
he'd be out right now
kissing a cute brunette.

16:24.715 --> 16:26.513
Things work out.

16:27.916 --> 16:30.112
You know that I love you
no matter what?

16:30.197 --> 16:33.350
You're trying to hold another person
inside of you to spare my feelings.

16:33.439 --> 16:35.590
Message received.

16:35.680 --> 16:37.194
Mmm.
Ooh, that's a strong grip.

16:37.280 --> 16:38.760
Ah, that's-that's-that's-Ooh!
Ow.

16:41.882 --> 16:44.035
Uh, she's gettin' close.

16:44.123 --> 16:46.959
She's at, like,
eight beautiful centimeters.

16:48.846 --> 16:51.156
Hey. I don't think we've met.
I'm Kenny.

16:51.246 --> 16:53.888
Hi. I'm disgusted.

16:55.528 --> 16:57.202
Mitchell, she won't
even look at me.

16:57.330 --> 17:00.131
Well, she can't really look at anyone.
I know.

17:00.212 --> 17:03.489
Oh! Look who's back...
again.

17:03.573 --> 17:06.693
- What happened this time?
- He threw me in the pool.

17:06.773 --> 17:08.573
Oh, no.
No, that's not what happened.

17:08.656 --> 17:10.170
It kind of is.

17:10.256 --> 17:12.295
Luke, come on.
We don't need to relive it.

17:13.738 --> 17:15.013
Daddy!
Oh, look at this.

17:15.138 --> 17:16.732
I'm coming! Daddy's coming!
What's wrong with me? Mitchell.

17:16.819 --> 17:19.733
When she fell in the pool,
she screamed for Daddy.

17:19.819 --> 17:22.212
She calls you "Dad."
She calls me "Daddy."

17:22.300 --> 17:25.058
- She got scared, and she called out for me.
- See?

17:25.144 --> 17:27.101
I guess Daddy was
worrying about nothing.

17:27.185 --> 17:29.542
But, you know,
I can be silly sometimes.

17:29.666 --> 17:31.305
You're always silly.

17:31.427 --> 17:34.306
No, you're silly.
No, you're always silly.

17:34.428 --> 17:36.021
No, you're always silly.

17:36.108 --> 17:37.510
My God.
What's wrong with me?

17:37.750 --> 17:39.742
The contractions are coming
a little bit closer.

17:39.870 --> 17:42.182
I think we have to call for a nurse.
No, no, no, Jay!

17:42.311 --> 17:44.224
No, please-I'm sorry. For what?

17:44.312 --> 17:48.434
I don't know yet. But I
know that babies make mothers crazy,

17:48.515 --> 17:50.189
and I'm going
to be making mistakes,

17:50.275 --> 17:52.029
and then I'm going to be
blaming you.

17:52.157 --> 17:55.070
Please don't leave me. You're
a little emotional right now.

17:55.158 --> 17:57.914
But it's been so long for me...

17:58.000 --> 18:00.310
and a hundred years for you.

18:00.401 --> 18:02.438
Are we still
going to be good at this?

18:02.522 --> 18:05.196
It's gonna be an adventure, but
that's what you and I do best.

18:05.282 --> 18:06.764
Look at today.

18:06.843 --> 18:09.280
I can't ever remember
having more fun with you.

18:09.364 --> 18:11.596
I'm so lucky.

18:11.686 --> 18:14.283
Now get out.

18:14.367 --> 18:16.280
- But I thought you wanted me to-
- No, not you.

18:16.368 --> 18:19.521
Get out!

18:24.332 --> 18:26.325
Hey. We should go.
Oh, right.

18:26.454 --> 18:27.967
Um, hey, guys.

18:28.053 --> 18:30.415
So Kenny and I were thinking
about going to this restaurant.

18:30.456 --> 18:33.052
Oh, sure. I don't have a problem with that.
Do you, Phil?

18:33.177 --> 18:36.011
No. In fact, it
has been such a pleasure...

18:36.097 --> 18:37.613
getting to know Kenny,
it's our treat.

18:37.699 --> 18:39.692
- Are you kidding?
- No!

18:39.780 --> 18:41.374
Give 'em
your credit card, Phil.

18:41.461 --> 18:46.254
Also, uh, this restaurant is pretty
far away, so we might be out late.

18:46.342 --> 18:49.018
Well, sweetheart, you are only young once.

18:49.104 --> 18:51.746
Well, might even make sense
to just stay in a hotel.

18:51.825 --> 18:53.420
Okay.
Put it on the plastic.

18:53.507 --> 18:54.576
Great!

18:54.666 --> 18:57.263
Okay. See you tomorrow!

18:57.348 --> 18:59.466
Bye-bye.

18:59.550 --> 19:02.942
Ugh. It's my ex-wife-not the good one.

19:03.031 --> 19:04.751
What do you want?

19:04.831 --> 19:07.142
Nice game of chicken, Claire.
She's gone!

19:07.233 --> 19:08.907
She's coming back.
I am almost positive.

19:09.034 --> 19:10.104
Almost?
Mm-hmm!

19:10.195 --> 19:11.709
Why do I listen to you? Why?

19:11.796 --> 19:13.469
You were wrong about
the iPod being a failure.

19:13.556 --> 19:15.514
You were wrong about
tomato being a vegetable.

19:15.636 --> 19:18.312
I don't even want to talk about
your favorite planet-Pluto!

19:18.398 --> 19:22.634
And unless she was lying to the good ladies
of The View, it's "De-mi," not "Dem-i"!

19:24.802 --> 19:27.637
You were
going to let me go with him?

19:27.723 --> 19:29.397
Isn't that what
you wanted, honey?

19:29.484 --> 19:30.965
What's the matter with you?

19:31.084 --> 19:33.681
You've been acting so weird
ever since I left college.

19:33.766 --> 19:37.125
For the record, you didn't leave college.
You were asked to leave.

19:37.208 --> 19:39.723
Oh, which you guys never let
me forget, especially Dad.

19:39.848 --> 19:41.408
Honey, your father-

19:41.490 --> 19:43.608
Oh, you don't have to tell me
what he thinks, okay?

19:43.731 --> 19:46.371
I'm a huge disappointment to him.
I see it on his face every day.

19:46.452 --> 19:48.649
He acts as if he doesn't
even want me around.

19:48.733 --> 19:50.452
- Give me the ticket for the car.
- Phil-

19:50.574 --> 19:53.774
I'm going after her! This chicken game may
work for your dad, but it doesn't for me.

19:53.855 --> 19:55.609
That's my little girl.
I need her to know...

19:55.696 --> 19:57.654
that no guy on earth
is good enough for her,

19:57.738 --> 19:59.934
let alone some slimy,
middle-aged jeans salesman!

20:03.340 --> 20:05.697
- What's this?
- Just enjoy it.

20:06.822 --> 20:09.941
There's all kinds
of milestones in life,

20:10.024 --> 20:11.856
the kind you expect
to live through-

20:11.944 --> 20:14.414
first kiss,

20:14.506 --> 20:16.385
birthdays,

20:17.386 --> 20:19.299
graduations.

20:19.387 --> 20:21.540
If you're lucky,
a wedding or two.

20:23.709 --> 20:25.908
Or even a new addition
to the family.

20:29.993 --> 20:33.033
Then there's the kind you never dreamed
you'd get to live through again.

20:33.114 --> 20:34.835
So adorable.

20:34.915 --> 20:36.396
So sweet.

20:36.517 --> 20:39.157
- Oh, my goodness.
- Oh.

20:47.562 --> 20:49.361
And that's
the best kind of all.

20:50.844 --> 20:52.722
Why am I spoiling it for you?

20:52.805 --> 20:54.636
You'll see for yourself.

20:59.207 --> 21:01.769
Oh, was it difficult?
Sí.

21:01.888 --> 21:04.324
It was the most painful
20 minutes of my life.

21:04.409 --> 21:06.641
Mmm. Oh, well, look at that.

21:06.811 --> 21:08.292
You're skinny again.
Yeah.

21:08.371 --> 21:09.886
Yeah.

21:09.972 --> 21:11.408
So wait.
He-He's my uncle?

21:11.494 --> 21:13.167
No. He's your
half brother-in-law.

21:13.294 --> 21:15.446
He's our uncle.
Half uncle or full uncle?

21:15.616 --> 21:18.132
What's a "fuluncle"? Okay. So don't
feel like you gotta stick around.

21:18.257 --> 21:20.169
Okay. We'll see you tomorrow then.
Okay, we'll be back tomorrow.

21:20.298 --> 21:21.698
Bye, Uncle. Congrats.

21:21.779 --> 21:23.975
He's adorable.

21:24.500 --> 21:25.729
Is he?

21:25.821 --> 21:28.336
I don't like this one bit.

21:28.421 --> 21:29.937
We'll talk.
