00:00.199 --> 00:01.565
Previously on
<i>Bones...</i>

00:01.644 --> 00:03.674
A plus sign! I'm pregnant!

00:03.675 --> 00:05.748
We're having a baby!
We're having a baby.

00:05.864 --> 00:07.331
Bones, what is all this?

00:07.366 --> 00:09.233
I've been getting
job offers for years.

00:09.268 --> 00:10.834
You know that.
So have you.

00:10.869 --> 00:13.103
Don't you think
we might need a change?

00:13.138 --> 00:14.838
Look, this is
important work, right?

00:14.873 --> 00:16.840
Or don't you think so anymore?
There are other

00:16.875 --> 00:19.109
important things we could do
that won't get us killed.

00:19.144 --> 00:20.645
This is my last case.

00:20.679 --> 00:22.379
You could take the job
at the NSA,

00:22.413 --> 00:24.381
and I could take over
the department at Fulton.

00:24.415 --> 00:28.618
Or we could just have a baby
and live our lives and be happy.

00:28.653 --> 00:30.387
This will be our last case.

00:30.421 --> 00:33.189
Booth and I...
need a change.

00:33.223 --> 00:35.258
I'm gonna miss you so much,
Brennan.

00:43.167 --> 00:46.235
BOOTH:
<i>And Booth comes in, he shoots.</i>

00:46.270 --> 00:48.705
Oh, he scores...!

00:48.739 --> 00:50.540
Flyers win! Flyers win!

00:50.574 --> 00:52.408
Flyers win. Oh, wow!
(baby cooing)

00:52.442 --> 00:54.010
Whew!

00:54.044 --> 00:56.913
Time for you to hit
the showers. Oh.

00:56.947 --> 00:58.747
Look at that, huh?
Hey, Hank, it's a battle axe.

00:58.782 --> 01:01.650
Mommy says it's a plow.

01:01.685 --> 01:03.385
Plow? Where's
the fun in that?

01:03.420 --> 01:05.387
The fun is in the accuracy,
Booth.

01:05.422 --> 01:08.024
The Munich Museum
sent me these to

01:08.058 --> 01:10.359
examine, and I'm teaching
Christine how to properly

01:10.393 --> 01:11.961
categorize and identify.

01:11.995 --> 01:14.197
Wow. Thought you were
working on your new book.

01:14.231 --> 01:15.964
I finished... both of them.

01:15.998 --> 01:17.465
That's amazing.

01:17.499 --> 01:18.566
BOOTH:
Ooh! Ooh!

01:18.600 --> 01:19.234
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

01:19.268 --> 01:20.202
Whoa! Whoa!

01:20.236 --> 01:21.502
Hey. Easy.

01:21.537 --> 01:22.737
Sharpshooter
there, huh?

01:22.771 --> 01:24.405
Just like your dad.

01:24.440 --> 01:25.907
Uh, Booth, don't forget--
Angela and Hodgins

01:25.942 --> 01:27.575
are having us over
tonight with the kids.

01:27.609 --> 01:29.711
Tonight? Geez, that's...
that might not be too good.

01:29.745 --> 01:31.546
I mean, it might be
a late night.

01:31.580 --> 01:33.248
Can we reschedule it?
No, we can't reschedule.

01:33.282 --> 01:35.350
You've been working late
all the time, and...

01:35.384 --> 01:36.718
and we promised.
Okay.

01:36.752 --> 01:37.919
Tell you what.
I'll make it work.

01:37.954 --> 01:39.587
We'll make it work. Won't we?

01:39.621 --> 01:42.390
Battle axe. Hank, big
defenseman for the Flyers.

01:42.424 --> 01:44.058
Coming your way.
Here he is, all yours.

01:44.092 --> 01:45.926
Sweetie pie.
All right, there you go.

01:45.961 --> 01:48.095
Okay, I'm late for work.
I got to get going.

01:48.129 --> 01:49.463
Tell Uncle Aubrey I miss him.

01:49.497 --> 01:51.031
Oh, Christine,
you know Daddy doesn't

01:51.066 --> 01:52.867
work for the FBI anymore.

01:52.901 --> 01:54.735
But he <i>goes</i> to the FBI.

01:54.769 --> 01:56.303
Well, it's a whole
new part of the FBI.

01:56.338 --> 01:58.138
See, what I do now is,
I train agents.

01:58.173 --> 02:00.241
Daddy is a freelance
instructor.

02:00.275 --> 02:03.010
What does "freelance" mean?
BOOTH: It means that

02:03.044 --> 02:04.411
I can do whatever I want.

02:04.445 --> 02:05.880
I can... I can go
whenever I want.

02:05.914 --> 02:07.248
I'm the boss, right?

02:07.282 --> 02:09.850
It means I can spend
more time with you, right?

02:09.883 --> 02:12.218
More time with the bruiser
battle axe Flyer here.

02:12.253 --> 02:13.553
(laughing):
Oh.

02:13.588 --> 02:15.589
And especially more time with you.
Aw.

02:15.623 --> 02:17.891
All right, listen, I gotta go.
See you later, alligators.

02:17.925 --> 02:19.259
In a while, crocodile!

02:19.293 --> 02:20.560
Take care of that battle axe!

02:20.595 --> 02:21.728
Plow.
Plow!

02:21.763 --> 02:23.397
Plow.

02:23.431 --> 02:26.900
Thank you so much for
catching me on that, all right?

02:26.934 --> 02:29.403
Bye.

02:29.437 --> 02:31.772
Bye.

02:34.641 --> 02:37.676
HODGINS:
<i>Exciting news.</i>

02:37.711 --> 02:40.245
I just incubated some
super-fast microbes.

02:40.280 --> 02:42.782
I mean, these guys replicate
like nobody's business.

02:42.816 --> 02:45.518
Yeah, I like to keep my office
a microbe-free zone.

02:45.552 --> 02:49.021
But these are
saccharomyces cerevisiae--

02:49.055 --> 02:51.524
the building blocks of beer.

02:51.558 --> 02:53.759
You know, I don't feel bad
for not knowing that.

02:53.794 --> 02:55.761
We haven't seen Booth
in a while, so, I wanted

02:55.796 --> 02:57.763
to brew him a really nice IPA
for tonight's dinner.

02:57.798 --> 02:59.197
Sorry to interrupt.

02:59.232 --> 03:00.365
Believe me, you're not.

03:00.400 --> 03:02.100
I need a reality check.

03:02.135 --> 03:03.969
I've been searching for a
replacement for Dr. Brennan,

03:04.003 --> 03:05.537
and it's been a half a year.

03:05.571 --> 03:07.406
Every time I find someone
who's qualified,

03:07.440 --> 03:10.909
I reach out to Brennan to get
her thoughts, and, well...

03:10.944 --> 03:12.411
she's had an issue with

03:12.445 --> 03:14.112
every single candidate.

03:14.147 --> 03:16.148
You think if she sees
who her replacement's gonna be,

03:16.182 --> 03:17.816
she'll change her mind
about coming back?

03:17.850 --> 03:19.517
Because that's not happening.

03:19.552 --> 03:21.786
All right, so, what do
you want our opinion on?

03:21.821 --> 03:24.189
Well...

03:24.223 --> 03:27.326
there is one name.

03:28.627 --> 03:31.595
But... I'm not sure.

03:31.629 --> 03:34.365
What would you think
of Arastoo?

03:34.399 --> 03:35.532
Yeah!

03:35.567 --> 03:37.201
Hey, he's perfect for it.

03:37.235 --> 03:39.536
He graduated
with highest honors.

03:39.571 --> 03:42.974
He's been doing an amazing job
filling in. I mean...

03:43.008 --> 03:44.875
Yeah. He probably should've
been in the mix from the start.

03:44.909 --> 03:47.011
Well, I know,
but I'm dating him, I...

03:47.045 --> 03:48.812
so I have to be absolutely sure

03:48.847 --> 03:50.681
that he's the best person
for the job.

03:50.715 --> 03:52.916
HODGINS: Well, I think he'd
be perfect, but...

03:52.951 --> 03:55.086
you're the boss.
It's your decision to make.

03:55.120 --> 03:56.553
Yeah.

03:57.622 --> 04:00.090
(phone rings)
Oh.

04:00.124 --> 04:02.658
Well, it looks like it's gonna
have to wait a bit longer.

04:02.693 --> 04:04.027
That's Aubrey.

04:04.061 --> 04:06.029
Got a body
torched in a van.

04:06.063 --> 04:07.697
And it sounds messy.

04:07.731 --> 04:10.367
Good-bye, my friends.

04:10.401 --> 04:12.168
Drink you later.

04:12.203 --> 04:14.237
Uh, Hodgins?

04:14.271 --> 04:15.872
Honey, get the...

04:15.906 --> 04:18.375
Ugh! Gross!

04:18.409 --> 04:20.743
(indistinct
radio communication)

04:20.777 --> 04:23.713
(various first responders and
techs conversing indistinctly)

04:30.754 --> 04:32.555
HODGINS:
Wow. Someone got their hands on

04:32.589 --> 04:35.992
a world-class incendiary device.

04:36.026 --> 04:38.661
Well, whoever it was really
wanted to get rid of this van.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.396
I had my people
run the VIN.

04:40.430 --> 04:42.832
It was stolen from a mall
in Baltimore this morning.

04:42.866 --> 04:44.567
Your people?
I delegated.

04:44.601 --> 04:46.569
That's how
I get things get done.

04:46.603 --> 04:48.738
Everything about this was
carefully thought out.

04:48.772 --> 04:52.107
Land's owned by a paper company:
no traffic, no hikers.

04:52.142 --> 04:53.608
SAROYAN:
Who found it?

04:53.643 --> 04:55.944
A fire station 20 miles away
spotted the smoke.

04:55.978 --> 04:57.946
By the time the crew got here,
wasn't much left.

04:57.980 --> 04:59.448
Based on what's left

04:59.482 --> 05:01.716
of the long bones,
we're looking at a male,

05:01.751 --> 05:03.985
over six feet,
athletic build.

05:04.020 --> 05:06.755
Dentition is degraded
from extreme heat, but

05:06.789 --> 05:08.323
this central incisor suggests

05:08.358 --> 05:11.427
he was Caucasian,
probably in his 40's.

05:11.461 --> 05:14.396
Really excellent work, Arastoo.

05:14.431 --> 05:17.999
Do we have cause of death yet?

05:18.034 --> 05:20.268
Not yet, but I suspect

05:20.302 --> 05:22.770
this gun fused to his leg
has something to do with it.

05:22.804 --> 05:24.772
AUBREY:
Looks like a Shield 40.

05:24.806 --> 05:26.140
Kept it in an ankle holster.

05:26.175 --> 05:28.276
It's a professional weapon.

05:28.310 --> 05:29.577
But what is that?

05:29.611 --> 05:31.412
Why didn't it burn
like everything else?

05:31.447 --> 05:33.647
Well, it's titanium.

05:33.682 --> 05:35.583
It's probably a toe insert
for a high-end tactical boot.

05:35.617 --> 05:37.785
AUBREY:
So, what was this guy up to?

05:37.819 --> 05:39.920
He had only the best equipment.

05:39.955 --> 05:41.956
Unfortunately,
it didn't do him much good.

05:43.000 --> 05:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:53.501 --> 05:56.035
This stuff is amazing.

05:56.070 --> 05:57.670
It was invented

05:57.705 --> 06:00.440
for housing insulation,
but its uses are endless.

06:00.475 --> 06:04.111
It's fascinating. Any way
you can get this done faster?

06:04.145 --> 06:06.580
Whoa! Patience, my friend.

06:06.614 --> 06:08.715
Do I tell you how to examine your bones?
You don't.

06:08.749 --> 06:10.617
And I'm grateful. And amazed

06:10.651 --> 06:12.051
you did this
without damaging the remains.

06:12.086 --> 06:13.886
Well, don't thank me.

06:13.921 --> 06:16.288
Thank the foam.
I'm okay with just thanking you.

06:16.323 --> 06:17.957
Ready?
(clears throat)

06:18.759 --> 06:21.527
(whirring)

06:33.640 --> 06:35.440
This tissue is all ash.

06:35.474 --> 06:36.942
VAZIRI:
Heat was

06:36.976 --> 06:38.810
so intense,
the brain turned to vapor.

06:38.845 --> 06:40.145
This fissure on the suture line

06:40.179 --> 06:41.980
was caused
by the escaping gases.

06:42.015 --> 06:43.653
So there's nothing I can get
from the body?

06:43.677 --> 06:44.315
No.

06:44.316 --> 06:46.818
It's all on me, but
I can handle this.

06:46.853 --> 06:48.486
I know.

06:51.223 --> 06:53.191
Angie, you okay?

06:53.225 --> 06:56.294
I ran the-the serial number
from the gun--

06:56.328 --> 06:58.163
you know, the gun you
found on the ankle-- and...

06:58.197 --> 07:00.398
You got a name?
Yeah, I couldn't believe it.

07:00.432 --> 07:03.535
It all matches up with what
you found: the age and the

07:03.569 --> 07:05.703
gender, the body
type, all of it.

07:05.737 --> 07:06.971
It's his gun.

07:07.005 --> 07:08.273
Whose gun?

07:08.307 --> 07:10.341
Booth's.

07:59.934 --> 08:01.201
SAROYAN:
<i>Do you know where he went?</i>

08:01.235 --> 08:02.803
He's just teaching.

08:02.805 --> 08:04.739
He got delayed.
That's all it is.

08:05.274 --> 08:06.774
It went straight
to voicemail.

08:06.808 --> 08:08.376
We tried calling
Booth, too.

08:08.410 --> 08:09.844
It's the first
thing we did.

08:09.878 --> 08:11.212
It's most likely poor service.

08:11.246 --> 08:12.847
I'll... I'll try again.

08:15.050 --> 08:19.120
Arastoo said the, uh, skeletal
features match Booth's.

08:19.154 --> 08:21.356
And we found his gun.

08:21.390 --> 08:23.557
Impossible.

08:23.592 --> 08:25.225
Booth is done
with field work.

08:25.259 --> 08:26.860
He doesn't carry
his gun anymore.

08:26.894 --> 08:29.262
Well, that's
what I thought.

08:39.374 --> 08:42.376
AUBREY: There was a weapon in every one
of those slots, right?

08:42.409 --> 08:44.378
What did he
do with them?

08:44.412 --> 08:48.448
I have... no idea.

08:51.284 --> 08:53.519
SAROYAN:
Is that...?

08:53.553 --> 08:55.454
It's Booth's wedding ring.

09:07.667 --> 09:09.035
Brennan, I don't think
that we should...

09:09.069 --> 09:10.036
Not now, Angela.

09:10.070 --> 09:11.703
(entrance gate blipping)

09:11.738 --> 09:14.140
The bones have been difficult
to examine.

09:14.174 --> 09:15.341
They're very degraded
from the intense fire.

09:15.375 --> 09:17.076
Extreme heat fracturing.

09:17.110 --> 09:19.177
It's impossible to tell
what's antemortem versus...

09:19.211 --> 09:21.179
I am well aware of the
difficulties of the task.

09:21.213 --> 09:22.414
What have you determined so far?

09:22.448 --> 09:24.416
All indications are
that this is Booth.

09:24.450 --> 09:26.373
Indications? Is that
how we decide things?

09:26.397 --> 09:27.252
No, I...

09:27.253 --> 09:29.387
I guess it's going
to be up to me, then...

09:29.422 --> 09:31.722
to know based on
all of the facts.

09:31.757 --> 09:34.359
Of course, but maybe
you shouldn't look at the...

09:34.393 --> 09:36.294
No one is more
qualified than I am

09:36.328 --> 09:38.396
to determine if these
are Booth's remains.

09:38.431 --> 09:41.232
Booth had remodeled fractures

09:41.267 --> 09:45.202
to his calcanei from
parachute training.

09:45.236 --> 09:47.071
VAZIRI: Yeah. I pulled Booth's medical
records. I checked for those.

09:47.105 --> 09:50.174
These remains have remodeled
fractures on the calcanei, too.

09:55.313 --> 09:58.115
Uh, bring up X-rays
of the scapulae

09:58.149 --> 09:59.516
and ribs five through eight.

09:59.551 --> 10:01.251
What are you looking for?

10:01.286 --> 10:02.953
Booth was beaten as
a child, by his father.

10:02.987 --> 10:06.123
He has defensive fractures
that would have remodeled.

10:06.157 --> 10:07.891
I looked for those, too,
and found them.

10:08.960 --> 10:09.960
(computer blipping)

10:12.730 --> 10:14.297
What about Booth's
brain surgery?

10:14.331 --> 10:15.799
VAZIRI:
The head was too degraded

10:15.833 --> 10:17.701
to find evidence of his
brain surgery, but after

10:17.735 --> 10:19.869
I fully reconstruct the cranium,
I'm quite certain that...

10:19.904 --> 10:21.471
Quite certain?
Indications?

10:21.505 --> 10:23.239
No.

10:23.273 --> 10:25.875
Please leave me with the bones.
I need to do this by myself.

10:25.910 --> 10:27.978
SAROYAN:
Arastoo...

10:28.012 --> 10:29.312
It's okay.

10:29.346 --> 10:31.848
Dr. Brennan needs to do this.

10:42.425 --> 10:45.360
You think it's him,
don't you?

10:46.529 --> 10:48.931
We left all this behind.

10:48.965 --> 10:51.000
It can't be him.

10:51.034 --> 10:53.869
It just can't.

AUBREY:

13:35.025 --> 13:38.161
has a connection
to Seeley Booth.

13:38.195 --> 13:41.631
He's trained us,
sacrificed for us,

13:41.666 --> 13:44.000
and more than one of us
wouldn't be alive today

13:44.034 --> 13:46.703
if it weren't for him,
so we owe it to him

13:46.737 --> 13:49.872
to figure out what the hell
happened out there.

13:49.907 --> 13:53.209
I'm putting one team
in charge of tracking every

13:53.243 --> 13:56.212
single movement that Agent Booth
made in the last 24 hours.

13:56.246 --> 13:58.047
And the rest of you

13:58.081 --> 14:01.851
will go through his casework.
And my office will make sure

14:01.885 --> 14:04.620
you have access
to all the records you need.

14:04.654 --> 14:06.622
Booth put away
a lot of killers.

14:06.656 --> 14:08.925
Any of them could be
out for revenge.

14:10.727 --> 14:12.527
I know how you feel.

14:12.561 --> 14:15.230
Use it to help us
find who did this.

14:15.264 --> 14:17.565
There is no time
to waste here, people.

14:17.599 --> 14:20.601
(indistinct chatter)

14:20.636 --> 14:22.370
MAN: Security team,
I need you over here.

14:22.404 --> 14:26.107
(sighs) Booth done sit
in this office ten years.

14:26.142 --> 14:29.510
Believe me, I wish
he was here.

14:29.545 --> 14:31.779
So what was Booth
doing with a gun?

14:31.814 --> 14:34.014
He didn't need it
to teach at Quantico.

14:34.049 --> 14:36.584
Must've been
one hell of a problem

14:36.618 --> 14:38.953
if he didn't come to me.

14:41.390 --> 14:42.790
Or me.

14:44.626 --> 14:45.926
(sighs)

14:45.961 --> 14:48.028
So what the hell...

14:48.063 --> 14:51.098
were you up to, Booth?

14:54.803 --> 14:56.571
The, uh, the eyes
aren't him.

14:56.605 --> 14:58.171
Okay, well,

14:58.205 --> 15:01.007
if I add some tissue
to the supraorbital notch...

15:01.041 --> 15:04.177
fill in the lips...

15:04.211 --> 15:07.013
and fill in the nasal cartilage.

15:07.047 --> 15:08.749
Oh, my, God,

15:08.783 --> 15:10.684
that-that's Booth.

15:10.718 --> 15:12.185
MONTENEGRO: I don't understand this.
Why would he

15:12.219 --> 15:14.020
put himself
in harm's way,

15:14.054 --> 15:15.955
especially after everything
he and Brennan had been through?

15:15.990 --> 15:17.624
HODGINS: We don't know
what happened, exactly.

15:17.658 --> 15:19.693
We just deal with the
concept of him being dead.

15:19.727 --> 15:21.027
BRENNAN:
It's not Booth.

15:21.062 --> 15:22.289
It's not Booth.

15:22.290 --> 15:23.321
Brennan...

15:23.345 --> 15:25.391
I know you think
I'm being delusional, but...

15:25.965 --> 15:28.000
I have proof.

15:33.807 --> 15:36.275
Booth was in a firefight
a year and a half ago

15:36.309 --> 15:38.444
And this body is
riddled with bullet wounds.

15:38.478 --> 15:39.978
There are so many fractures,
you can't tell

15:40.013 --> 15:41.514
what's a bullet wound and what isn't.
Yes.

15:41.548 --> 15:44.850
It takes a lot
of experience to do so.

15:44.885 --> 15:46.484
Are you sure this isn't Booth?

15:46.519 --> 15:48.686
This is where a
bullet passed through

15:48.721 --> 15:49.955
Booth's body,

15:49.989 --> 15:52.791
breaking off
a portion of the rib bone.

15:52.825 --> 15:55.160
It's fractured, it's consistent.
I-It's in my notes.

15:55.194 --> 15:58.397
When the bullet exited
Booth's body, a small portion

15:58.431 --> 15:59.998
of his left scapula

16:00.033 --> 16:02.367
was carried along with it.

16:05.871 --> 16:07.505
The scapula is intact.

16:07.540 --> 16:10.142
He's alive.

16:13.711 --> 16:15.512
I hope this isn't indicative

16:15.547 --> 16:18.115
of how you've been running
the Jeffersonian in my absence.

16:18.150 --> 16:21.419
This was my oversight,
not Dr. Saroyan's.

16:21.453 --> 16:22.853
I understand
that you're angry and...

16:22.887 --> 16:24.255
You told me
my husband is dead.

16:24.289 --> 16:26.824
Angry doesn't begin
to cover it.

16:26.858 --> 16:29.360
I'm sorry.
There's no time for that.

16:29.394 --> 16:31.262
We still don't know
who this is or how he died.

16:31.296 --> 16:32.796
And we'll figure that out.

16:32.831 --> 16:34.131
Yes, we will.

16:34.166 --> 16:36.067
Dr. Brennan...

16:36.101 --> 16:37.701
This man had Booth's gun.

16:37.735 --> 16:39.370
Now Booth is gone.

16:39.404 --> 16:41.871
I am not leaving
until these bones lead me

16:41.905 --> 16:44.240
to wherever the hell
my husband is.

16:52.583 --> 16:56.719
CAROLINE: <i>If Seeley Booth's isn't dead,</i>
<i>he's in trouble.</i>

16:56.753 --> 16:58.888
Well, he swiped into
the C-Structure at Quantico

16:58.922 --> 17:02.592
at 9:23, swiped out
at 9:49 a.m.

17:02.626 --> 17:04.361
I thought Quantico
hadn't seen him.

17:04.395 --> 17:06.060
Well, he never showed up
for his classes,

17:06.096 --> 17:07.964
but he did access the armory.

17:07.998 --> 17:09.965
For what?
Well, they're running inventory,

17:10.000 --> 17:11.165
they'll find it.

17:11.201 --> 17:12.635
He didn't use
any credit cards.

17:12.669 --> 17:14.369
He didn't use his
cell phone all morning.

17:14.404 --> 17:15.704
Unless he was on a burner.

17:15.739 --> 17:17.172
Why would Booth
need a burner?

17:17.207 --> 17:18.875
Why would he need
to take his guns

17:18.909 --> 17:20.910
and leave his wedding ring?
(phone chimes)

17:20.944 --> 17:23.244
That's weird.
What you got, <i>Cher?</i>

17:23.279 --> 17:25.247
I put out an APB on Booth's car.

17:25.281 --> 17:28.250
It's at long-term parking
at Reagan.

17:28.284 --> 17:30.419
But he never got on a flight.

17:33.123 --> 17:35.024
What?

17:35.058 --> 17:36.191
Her.

17:37.127 --> 17:38.660
Hello, Caroline.

17:38.694 --> 17:40.629
Agent Miller,
this is Agent Aubrey.

17:40.663 --> 17:42.264
Oh, I've heard
a lot about you.

17:42.298 --> 17:44.066
I'm looking forward to collaborating
with you on this case.

17:44.100 --> 17:47.036
Uh, no one told me
I'd be collaborating.

17:47.070 --> 17:49.104
She's from internal
investigations.

17:49.139 --> 17:51.640
There won't be much
of a collaboration.

17:51.674 --> 17:53.808
They've sicced her
on Booth.

17:53.843 --> 17:55.810
I will work with you
to the extent that I can,

17:55.845 --> 17:58.447
but when a former agent is a suspect, it...
Booth?

17:58.481 --> 18:00.048
Booth isn't a suspect.

18:00.082 --> 18:02.016
All we know is that
he disappeared.

18:02.051 --> 18:04.018
Let's not make it out
to be more than that.

18:04.053 --> 18:05.819
Look, I have
a partner, too.

18:05.854 --> 18:08.856
I know how it works. You trust
one another, you get close,

18:08.890 --> 18:11.192
and then it's hard to see
a friend become a suspect.

18:11.226 --> 18:13.094
Okay, if you're gonna
come in here and make

18:13.128 --> 18:15.563
absurd accusations,
then we don't need you.

18:15.597 --> 18:17.031
Not your call.

18:17.066 --> 18:19.100
There's a dead man
on a table, burnt to a crisp

18:19.134 --> 18:20.734
with Booth's gun on him.

18:20.769 --> 18:23.438
Tell me how that doesn't
make him as a suspect.

18:27.987 --> 18:29.621
MILLER: <i>When was the last time
you saw your husband?</i>

18:30.064 --> 18:33.366
When he left the house
at 8:36 yesterday morning.

18:33.401 --> 18:35.568
That's a very
precise time.

18:35.603 --> 18:38.471
She's a very
precise lady.

18:38.506 --> 18:41.208
I need you to describe
your husband's behavior

18:41.242 --> 18:42.475
over the past few days.

18:42.510 --> 18:44.477
Anthropologically,
there are seven

18:44.512 --> 18:46.746
basic modes of behavior

18:46.781 --> 18:49.081
and many subsets.

18:49.116 --> 18:50.583
I need you
to be more specific.

18:50.618 --> 18:54.253
You might have noticed
that he was stressed.

18:54.288 --> 18:56.356
Or acting out of character.

18:56.390 --> 18:59.058
Surely you might have felt
it if he wasn't his usual self.

18:59.092 --> 19:01.695
You are asking
strictly emotional questions.

19:01.729 --> 19:03.896
It is well-documented
that emotions

19:03.931 --> 19:05.632
are not my area of expertise.

19:05.666 --> 19:07.200
And why would
I do that?

19:07.234 --> 19:09.369
My conclusion is that you are
deliberately attempting

19:09.403 --> 19:13.206
to make me uncomfortable,
in order to extract something

19:13.240 --> 19:14.707
you think I'm hiding.

19:14.741 --> 19:15.808
If that is the case,

19:15.843 --> 19:17.977
I... no longer choose

19:18.011 --> 19:20.179
to participate
in this discussion.

19:20.214 --> 19:21.513
MILLER:
Thank you.

19:21.548 --> 19:23.349
You may go.
You're no longer needed.

19:23.383 --> 19:27.320
You... you can't solve this case
without me.

19:27.354 --> 19:29.322
Dr. Brennan, with
all due respect,

19:29.356 --> 19:31.257
you are the suspect's wife.
What makes you Th...

19:31.291 --> 19:33.692
I'm the world's foremost
forensic anthropologist.

19:33.727 --> 19:36.128
You need me
to examine those bones.

19:36.163 --> 19:37.463
But it's my case.
Which has to do

19:37.497 --> 19:39.165
with my husband.
Which is why

19:39.199 --> 19:41.334
I can have you removed.

19:41.368 --> 19:45.170
You best be careful how
you respond, <i>Cher--</i>

19:45.204 --> 19:47.973
Booth's life might depend on it.

19:54.680 --> 19:57.883
Hey, just in time to check
out a buffelgrass seed.

19:57.917 --> 20:00.919
I found it on the body and
cross-sectioned it for an I.D.,

20:00.953 --> 20:03.255
which is kind of a shame 'cause
it was probably still viable.

20:03.289 --> 20:05.256
How could a seed have stayed
intact during the fire?

20:05.290 --> 20:07.324
Well, that is the amazing
thing about buffelgrass--

20:07.359 --> 20:09.659
it grows on volcanoes,
so it only germinates

20:09.694 --> 20:11.428
after being
exposed to heat.

20:11.462 --> 20:13.563
Good catch.

20:13.598 --> 20:15.766
You're not here to talk about
buffelgrass. What's up?

20:15.800 --> 20:17.234
Do me a favor.

20:17.269 --> 20:19.770
Take a look
at this section of vertebra.

20:21.439 --> 20:23.740
Okay, looks like a
bunch of osteoblasts.

20:23.775 --> 20:25.074
The density's low,
which indicates

20:25.109 --> 20:27.110
a progressed form
of osteoporosis.

20:27.144 --> 20:28.878
That tells us the victim
was an alcoholic.

20:28.913 --> 20:30.880
Yeah, it also tells us that
Dr. Brennan was right--

20:30.915 --> 20:32.115
it wasn't Booth.
Good catch.

20:32.149 --> 20:34.117
I didn't find it.

20:34.151 --> 20:36.319
Dr. Brennan did.
That's two things I've missed.

20:36.353 --> 20:38.821
You can't worry about
what Dr. Brennan said.

20:40.524 --> 20:43.092
It's not what <i>she</i> thinks
I'm worried about.

20:43.127 --> 20:46.929
Whoa.
You're gonna ask Cam?

20:46.963 --> 20:48.798
How can I?
How can I even stay here

20:48.832 --> 20:51.266
if I'm not up to the job? Dr.
Brennan would never have

20:51.301 --> 20:53.135
hired you if she didn't
think you could do this.

20:53.169 --> 20:55.638
And Cam?
Cam would never have kept you

20:55.672 --> 20:57.506
if she didn't know
you could do this.

20:57.541 --> 20:59.542
Hey, when Michael Jordan
retired, you think that

20:59.576 --> 21:02.210
Scottie Pippen just stepped
into his shoes right away?

21:02.245 --> 21:05.614
Pippen didn't
step into Jordan's shoes.

21:05.649 --> 21:07.616
He never won anything
after Jordan retired.

21:07.651 --> 21:08.783
And he wasn't
half the player Jordan was.

21:08.818 --> 21:10.285
Okay, that was
a bad example.

21:10.320 --> 21:13.755
Ter-Terrible example.
My point here is that

21:13.789 --> 21:16.224
you're not Brennan, okay?

21:16.259 --> 21:18.126
But Cam knows how good you are.

21:20.196 --> 21:23.932
Trust me on this.
Take your shot.

21:23.967 --> 21:26.268
MONTENEGRO:
<i>So I've gone through</i>

21:26.302 --> 21:28.270
<i>Booth's phone records</i>
<i>for the week.</i>

21:28.304 --> 21:30.772
Calls to Brennan, Parker...

21:30.806 --> 21:32.273
his friends, you among them,

21:32.307 --> 21:33.808
and there's nothing
out of the ordinary.

21:33.843 --> 21:35.610
Booth's smart.

21:35.644 --> 21:37.645
If he's hiding something,
he'd cover his tracks.

21:37.680 --> 21:39.380
You know he wasn't
mixed up in anything.

21:39.414 --> 21:42.316
He has to have
talked to somebody.

21:42.351 --> 21:44.318
He can't have vanished
and left his family

21:44.353 --> 21:46.320
without saying something
to someone.

21:46.355 --> 21:47.321
Oh, my God.

21:47.356 --> 21:49.130
That's it.

21:49.131 --> 21:49.733
What?

21:49.757 --> 21:51.593
We've been going
about this the wrong way.

21:51.594 --> 21:54.327
It's who he didn't talk to
that we need to look at.

21:54.362 --> 21:56.329
The calls he didn't pick up?

21:56.364 --> 21:58.866
Yeah, three of them
yesterday morning.

21:59.968 --> 22:02.769
Wait a second,
I-I know that.

22:02.804 --> 22:04.605
That-That's code.

22:04.639 --> 22:06.439
Um, I'm-I'm not seeing it.

22:06.474 --> 22:08.642
That's because you weren't
ever a Boy Scout. That's...

22:08.676 --> 22:12.312
Scout code: length translates
to number of rings.

22:12.346 --> 22:14.481
Okay, uh...

22:14.515 --> 22:16.883
All right,
I get seven, one, five.

22:16.917 --> 22:19.685
Seven is "G."
One-five, 15 is "O."

22:21.989 --> 22:24.790
Spells "go."

22:24.825 --> 22:26.458
Someone sent him a message.

22:26.493 --> 22:28.661
He wasn't working alone.

22:31.732 --> 22:34.700
You wanted to see me, Dr. Vaziri?
Yes.

22:34.735 --> 22:38.838
I found something interesting on
the left anterior iliac spine.

22:38.872 --> 22:40.540
Striations on the wound.

22:40.574 --> 22:42.174
An indicator he was shot.

22:42.208 --> 22:45.344
I agree. This is
an excellent observation. And...

22:45.378 --> 22:48.213
the bullet would have passed
through the body and...

22:48.248 --> 22:50.882
compromised
the external iliac artery.

22:50.917 --> 22:54.053
You found cause of death.

22:55.888 --> 22:57.956
Huh.

22:57.990 --> 23:01.626
What do you think,
Dr. Vaziri?

23:01.661 --> 23:03.862
There are slight incisions.

23:03.896 --> 23:05.364
The level of remodeling suggests

23:05.398 --> 23:06.965
they're more
than three years old.

23:06.999 --> 23:08.967
They're from
an extremely sharp instrument.

23:09.001 --> 23:12.103
A razor blade or a scalpel.

23:14.406 --> 23:16.775
I believe
you are correct.

23:18.243 --> 23:21.179
This tells me who this is.

23:21.213 --> 23:23.181
How could it?
The victim has

23:23.215 --> 23:24.916
the same bone structure
as Booth.

23:24.951 --> 23:27.586
They even have similar stress
fractures to the calcaneus,

23:27.620 --> 23:30.689
similar injuries indicative
of childhood abuse.

23:30.723 --> 23:32.057
Booth has a brother.

23:34.926 --> 23:37.861
He and Jared were both beaten
by their father.

23:37.896 --> 23:41.899
They both were in the military,
made numerous parachute jumps,

23:41.933 --> 23:44.101
and Jared had
an emergency appendectomy

23:44.135 --> 23:45.936
performed by a field medic.
A botched job

23:45.971 --> 23:47.638
would have left
these incisions.

23:47.672 --> 23:49.473
That explains why
Angela's reconstruction

23:49.507 --> 23:51.408
looks so much like Booth.

23:51.442 --> 23:55.813
If I adjust the eyes...

23:55.847 --> 24:00.618
change some tissue...

24:00.652 --> 24:05.321
I'm now certain that our victim
is Jared Booth.

24:15.955 --> 24:18.823
Jared married Padma eight years ago.
It didn't last.

24:18.861 --> 24:20.227
Because she was a prostitute?

24:20.262 --> 24:23.698
I wasn't withholding that
from you.

24:23.732 --> 24:25.700
Well, you didn't choose
to share it either.

24:25.734 --> 24:27.735
But it was irrelevant.

24:27.770 --> 24:30.104
Jared had difficulties.

24:30.138 --> 24:33.374
After the Navy, he went
from job to job.

24:33.408 --> 24:34.943
I'd hoped she'd be good for him.

24:34.977 --> 24:37.912
Social outliers
like Jared and Padma

24:37.947 --> 24:39.413
are often drawn to each other.

24:39.448 --> 24:40.915
Booth's an outlier, too,

24:40.950 --> 24:42.750
and maybe he's more
like his brother than

24:42.785 --> 24:45.418
you're willing to acknowledge.
No, Booth is not like Jared.

24:45.453 --> 24:47.788
He had documented
authority issues,

24:47.822 --> 24:49.089
mandated counseling,

24:49.123 --> 24:50.457
and a-a gambling addiction

24:50.492 --> 24:52.125
that should have ended
his career.

24:52.159 --> 24:53.994
Booth knew he had weaknesses,

24:54.028 --> 24:56.663
and he worked on them.

24:56.698 --> 24:59.065
Jared refused to work on his.

24:59.100 --> 25:00.000
I'm sure that
created resentment.

25:00.034 --> 25:01.735
I bet they fought.

25:01.769 --> 25:05.005
You are implying that Booth
may have killed his brother.

25:05.039 --> 25:07.440
That is
categorically impossible.

25:07.475 --> 25:08.590
You don't know Booth.

25:08.614 --> 25:10.143
I know that he's been
telling you many lies

25:10.144 --> 25:12.078
and you're just not
willing to accept that.

25:16.083 --> 25:17.717
MONTENEGRO:
So, I traced the phone

25:17.751 --> 25:20.053
that called Booth
with the "go" message.

25:20.087 --> 25:22.622
I know it was purchased on
September 15, along with

25:22.656 --> 25:24.457
14 other
cell phones.

25:24.492 --> 25:25.925
SAROYAN: So if it was
Jared calling him,

25:25.959 --> 25:28.395
what did he need
so many burners for?

25:28.429 --> 25:30.663
They couldn't all have been for him.
MONTENEGRO: Yeah.

25:30.697 --> 25:32.165
My thoughts exactly.

25:32.199 --> 25:33.433
Five were
activated each week

25:33.467 --> 25:35.568
and then discarded
before another set

25:35.602 --> 25:37.136
of five were turned on.

25:37.170 --> 25:40.072
But always in groups of five?
Yeah.

25:40.106 --> 25:42.074
It's a team.

25:42.108 --> 25:44.410
It's not just Booth and Jared.

25:44.444 --> 25:46.546
What were they involved in?

25:52.052 --> 25:54.020
MILLER:
<i>Can you think of anyone</i>

25:54.054 --> 25:56.188
<i>who might have wanted</i>
<i>to harm your husband?</i>

25:56.222 --> 25:57.557
Jared owed money.

25:57.591 --> 25:59.558
Pissed a lot of people off.

25:59.592 --> 26:02.327
But nothing that
would lead to this.

26:02.362 --> 26:04.496
MILLER:
New TV... watch

26:04.531 --> 26:06.998
that you're wearing probably
cost a few thousand dollars.

26:07.033 --> 26:08.600
Doesn't seem like someone
who was in debt.

26:08.634 --> 26:10.335
I threw Jared out
three months ago.

26:10.370 --> 26:11.836
He wanted back in.

26:11.871 --> 26:13.672
The gifts kept getting better
and better.

26:13.706 --> 26:15.274
Did Booth give him
the money?

26:15.308 --> 26:16.975
(scoffs)
You're kidding, right?

26:17.009 --> 26:20.079
So you're saying that Booth
didn't give him the money?

26:20.113 --> 26:22.256
I'm saying Booth's wife
convinced him to cut Jared off.

26:22.280 --> 26:23.048
We both know

26:23.049 --> 26:24.749
what would have happened
if we gave Jared the money.

26:24.784 --> 26:27.651
It wouldn't have changed this.

26:27.686 --> 26:30.488
MILLER: Okay, so if the money
didn't come from Agent Booth

26:30.522 --> 26:33.091
then where did it come from?
I don't know exactly.

26:33.125 --> 26:35.526
A friend was trying
to help him get back on track.

26:35.561 --> 26:37.495
Does this friend have a name?

26:44.103 --> 26:46.571
Kevin O'Donnell.

26:46.605 --> 26:49.240
He's the one on the right.

26:49.274 --> 26:52.510
He was like a brother to Jared.

26:57.781 --> 27:00.150
VAZIRI: <i>I finally pieced together</i>
<i>the rest</i>

27:00.184 --> 27:02.419
of the skull
and found perimortem abrasions

27:02.453 --> 27:03.753
on the occipital.

27:03.787 --> 27:06.789
Can you magnify that?

27:10.161 --> 27:13.497
What are those particulates?
I don't know.

27:13.531 --> 27:14.998
Looks like glass,
but the heat from the fire

27:15.032 --> 27:16.733
could have chemically changed
whatever it was.

27:16.767 --> 27:18.001
Well, you should

27:18.035 --> 27:19.401
ask Hodgins to swab it.

27:19.436 --> 27:20.770
Already have.

27:22.106 --> 27:23.572
Uh...

27:23.607 --> 27:25.474
Oh. You're not supposed
to see that.

27:25.509 --> 27:26.743
I wasn't?

27:26.777 --> 27:28.344
Uh, I mean, you were,

27:28.378 --> 27:30.179
but then all this stuff
with Booth started happening

27:30.213 --> 27:31.648
and...
Oh, God.

27:31.682 --> 27:34.083
Is that what I think it is?

27:34.118 --> 27:36.119
It is.

27:37.787 --> 27:41.256
But this isn't the right time.
Is it?

27:41.290 --> 27:44.059
No. I mean...
You're-you're right. There's...

27:44.093 --> 27:47.062
so much going on.

27:47.096 --> 27:49.397
Do you want to see it?

27:51.067 --> 27:52.734
This isn't me asking.

27:52.769 --> 27:54.602
Just showing.

28:01.110 --> 28:03.745
Oh... my... God.

28:03.780 --> 28:07.181
Dude, you asked her.
Good for you.

28:07.215 --> 28:09.016
Uh... no, actually.

28:09.051 --> 28:10.384
She said no?

28:10.418 --> 28:13.453
Uh, he hasn't asked yet.

28:19.627 --> 28:21.295
(anxious laugh)

28:21.329 --> 28:23.698
Okay.
What'd you find out about O'Donnell?

28:23.732 --> 28:26.033
He comes from a family
of Navy lifers.

28:26.068 --> 28:29.035
Discharge?
Honorable. He was decorated.

28:29.070 --> 28:31.871
Geez. Hell of a place
for a war hero to live.

28:31.906 --> 28:33.439
Teaches school now.

28:33.473 --> 28:36.409
We have got to do
something about pay scale.

28:38.012 --> 28:39.813
(baby crying in distance)
You Kevin O'Donnell?

28:39.847 --> 28:41.815
We're from the FBI.

28:41.849 --> 28:44.818
What's this about?
Jared Booth, your buddy.

28:44.852 --> 28:47.821
Come on in.

28:47.855 --> 28:50.423
O'DONNELL:
<i>Jared was one of my guys.</i>

28:50.457 --> 28:54.026
I'd never turn my back on anyone
from my unit.

28:54.060 --> 28:57.463
I can't believe he's gone.

28:57.497 --> 29:00.099
When was the last time
you saw him?

29:00.133 --> 29:02.634
Two nights ago.
He was getting a handle

29:02.668 --> 29:05.437
on things, talking about
moving back in with his wife.

29:05.471 --> 29:07.606
When he didn't show
up here last night,

29:07.640 --> 29:09.807
I figured he'd
made up with her.

29:09.842 --> 29:11.142
Well, according to his wife,
they never made up.

29:11.176 --> 29:12.744
I don't know
what to say.

29:12.778 --> 29:14.613
He had a job, was
making good money.

29:14.647 --> 29:17.048
Where was he working?
He said something about security,

29:17.082 --> 29:18.750
but he didn't go into detail.
Did he talk to you

29:18.784 --> 29:20.418
about anything else?
About his brother?

29:20.453 --> 29:22.987
Any illegal activities?

29:23.021 --> 29:24.822
He's dead.

29:24.857 --> 29:26.929
Does that make him a suspect
in something?

29:26.930 --> 29:27.671
No, we're just...

29:27.695 --> 29:29.493
Doing your job. Yeah,
I've heard that one before.

29:29.494 --> 29:32.130
I'll make it easy for you.
The man went through hell.

29:32.164 --> 29:33.497
It's hard to adjust
to civilian life

29:33.531 --> 29:35.332
after the crap we went through.

29:35.367 --> 29:37.468
As far as I'm concerned,
he's a damn hero, and I resent

29:37.502 --> 29:39.336
you putting your garbage
assumptions on him.

29:39.371 --> 29:41.672
These aren't exactly assumptions...
I think we're done here.

29:41.706 --> 29:43.841
Well, we just have a few more questions.
Not even one.

29:51.850 --> 29:54.652
Thank you.

29:54.686 --> 29:58.322
If you think of anything...

30:21.145 --> 30:23.113
Hey.
Hi.

30:23.147 --> 30:25.282
I found these in the fridge.
Oh.

30:25.316 --> 30:26.028
Yeah.

30:26.051 --> 30:28.051
I'm quite certain
these were here when I left.

30:28.052 --> 30:32.155
I know. What's scary is
is they still have not expired.

30:35.259 --> 30:40.230
I know it is a common gesture
to bring someone who is grieving

30:40.264 --> 30:43.233
an offering of food, but...

30:43.267 --> 30:46.402
there's no evidence
that Booth is dead.

30:46.437 --> 30:49.739
I wasn't jumping
to that conclusion, but...

30:49.773 --> 30:52.274
Booth is still out there
somewhere.

30:54.545 --> 30:58.948
I hope so, sweetie.
I really do.

30:58.982 --> 31:01.384
(strained panting)

VAZIRI:
<i>On the fractures</i>

31:27.649 --> 31:28.682
to the posterior portion

31:28.716 --> 31:29.950
of ribs four through seven,

31:29.984 --> 31:31.618
as well as the
spinous processes.

31:33.371 --> 31:36.140
The fractures do appear
to line up symmetrically

31:36.175 --> 31:38.141
at the exterior curve
of the ribs,

31:38.176 --> 31:41.444
suggesting
some kind of blow,

31:41.478 --> 31:44.981
but whatever caused it
must have been quite large.

31:45.016 --> 31:47.017
What if the fractures were
the result of a fall?

31:47.051 --> 31:49.519
Uh... typically,
when someone falls,

31:49.553 --> 31:51.855
the initial impact is either
to the feet or the head.

31:51.889 --> 31:54.757
But what if Jared was attempting
to arrest his own fall?

31:56.527 --> 31:59.461
I see what you're saying.

31:59.495 --> 32:02.164
There are direct
impact fractures

32:02.199 --> 32:05.968
to the posterior aspect
of the vertebral ribs.

32:06.002 --> 32:07.937
And blowout fractures
to the anterior aspect.

32:07.971 --> 32:10.706
Judging from the severity
of these fractures,

32:10.740 --> 32:12.975
he must have fallen
at least 15 meters.

32:13.009 --> 32:16.011
Or three stories.
If it was indeed glass

32:16.046 --> 32:18.447
you found in his occipital,

32:18.481 --> 32:21.649
this may help Dr. Hodgins
identify the source.

32:21.683 --> 32:24.452
HODGINS:
<i>You guys were right.</i>

32:24.486 --> 32:26.020
The particulates in
Jared's skull <i>were</i> glass.

32:26.055 --> 32:28.489
This is lead-based.
Unique crystalline structure.

32:28.523 --> 32:30.959
This stuff is only
manufactured in Turkey.

32:30.993 --> 32:32.626
So he was likely shot
by a high-caliber weapon,

32:32.661 --> 32:33.962
then fell
through a third-story window.

32:33.996 --> 32:35.629
I got to get this to Angela.

32:35.664 --> 32:37.031
All we have to do
is look at every building

32:37.066 --> 32:38.466
three stories or higher
that was built

32:38.500 --> 32:40.001
with this stuff.
Can't be that many.

32:42.003 --> 32:43.257
Jared's financials
for the past three years.

32:43.281 --> 32:44.537
AUBREY: You find out

32:44.538 --> 32:46.740
where he was working?
No tax returns. No W-2s.

32:46.774 --> 32:48.508
If he was working,
it was off the books.

32:48.542 --> 32:50.510
But he <i>was</i> buying things
for his wife.

32:50.544 --> 32:52.746
We are gonna get
to the source of that money.

32:52.780 --> 32:55.048
Booth opened up a bank
account three months ago.

32:55.083 --> 32:57.517
The only debits went
directly to Jared.

32:57.551 --> 32:59.186
So?
He was helping his brother.

32:59.220 --> 33:00.854
Or planning
whatever got Jared killed.

33:00.889 --> 33:03.623
At the least, it made
Booth an accessory.

33:03.657 --> 33:05.458
What is it with you?

33:05.493 --> 33:08.027
You will not be satisfied until
you've ruined a good man's name.

33:08.061 --> 33:09.896
(phone ringing)
Booth's already done that to himself.

33:09.930 --> 33:11.297
Miller.

33:11.331 --> 33:13.199
Oh. Uh, okay.
Uh, Montenegro here.

33:13.233 --> 33:15.368
I-I found something
important.

33:16.203 --> 33:18.237
Oh. Hey, guys.

33:18.272 --> 33:19.706
HODGINS:
Ooh. Everything okay?

33:19.740 --> 33:21.374
Peachy. What do you got?

33:21.409 --> 33:22.776
MONTENEGRO:
Hodgins found

33:22.810 --> 33:24.611
a grass seed
in the burned-out van.

33:24.645 --> 33:26.379
It's a rare variant
of buffelgrass.

33:26.414 --> 33:28.213
It had to be imported.

33:28.247 --> 33:31.116
Which means it would have to go
through agricultural inspection.

33:31.150 --> 33:33.084
Yeah, I searched
for local addresses on record

33:33.119 --> 33:34.720
with international flora
inspection agencies,

33:34.754 --> 33:38.390
and narrowed it down
to 135 possible locations.

33:38.425 --> 33:41.226
That's not a lead.
That's a wild goose chase.

33:41.260 --> 33:42.594
Uh, I cross-checked
every location

33:42.629 --> 33:44.062
against any houses
with lead-based glass

33:44.096 --> 33:46.097
like the type
that we found in the victim.

33:46.132 --> 33:48.400
You think that we have time to
be running all over the place?

33:48.434 --> 33:49.935
HODGINS: We also know
that Jared Booth fell

33:49.969 --> 33:51.602
from a three-story structure.

33:51.637 --> 33:53.338
And that it's in
McLean, Virginia.

33:53.372 --> 33:55.907
The house is
owned by, uh...

33:55.942 --> 33:57.542
CAROLINE: That is

33:57.576 --> 33:59.110
Victor Masbourian.

33:59.145 --> 34:01.212
Wild guess, but I take
it he's not a friend.

34:01.247 --> 34:03.548
Masbourian is the worst
of the worst.

34:03.582 --> 34:04.582
He's into drugs,
racketeering,

34:04.616 --> 34:06.418
human trafficking.

34:06.452 --> 34:09.054
So, if Jared was killed
at Masbourian's house,

34:09.088 --> 34:10.922
Booth might be held
captive there.

34:10.956 --> 34:12.290
We're going in.

AUBREY
No.

That's six hours
after Booth was last seen.

37:13.784 --> 37:15.518
Masbourian was shot
center core,

37:15.553 --> 37:18.488
straight through
the spinal cord.

37:18.522 --> 37:22.191
The shooter was well-trained,
a professional, just like Booth.

37:22.225 --> 37:23.525
SAROYAN: There's no way.
Booth's as good

37:23.560 --> 37:25.027
as they get,
but he's no executioner.

37:25.062 --> 37:26.528
AUBREY: Besides,
we don't even have proof

37:26.563 --> 37:27.863
that Booth was here.

37:27.898 --> 37:29.264
We're gonna have
to break it down,

37:29.299 --> 37:30.532
spatter by spatter.

37:30.567 --> 37:32.434
I'm gonna need every inch

37:32.469 --> 37:34.036
of every surface of this room
photographed.

37:34.071 --> 37:35.871
Found something!

37:35.906 --> 37:38.340
(safe squeaking open)
A wall safe.

37:38.374 --> 37:40.275
Looks kind of vintage.

37:40.310 --> 37:42.344
Well, that's the genius of it.

37:42.378 --> 37:44.813
It was wired inside.

37:44.847 --> 37:46.380
Opening it.

37:46.415 --> 37:49.383
It tripped a silent alarm.

37:49.418 --> 37:51.086
And that alerted Masbourian.

37:51.120 --> 37:52.921
So, it was a robbery gone wrong.

37:52.955 --> 37:55.189
Very wrong. It's murder.

37:55.224 --> 37:56.591
We're gonna get
the guys behind it,

37:56.626 --> 37:58.093
and one of them is Booth.

38:15.043 --> 38:17.244
VAZIRI:
Cam called.

38:17.278 --> 38:18.912
They're coming back
with three bodies.

38:18.947 --> 38:21.381
Then I suggest you get
some sleep while you can.

38:21.415 --> 38:23.450
How are you holding up?

38:24.953 --> 38:27.387
Not well.

38:27.421 --> 38:29.723
I have more questions
than answers,

38:29.758 --> 38:32.559
which is unusual for me.

38:32.593 --> 38:35.462
And I'm angry.
Dr. Brennan,

38:35.496 --> 38:38.731
I understand how you're feeling,
but we don't know all the facts.

38:38.766 --> 38:40.567
Booth promised
he wouldn't see Jared.

38:40.601 --> 38:42.636
That's probably the only promise
he couldn't keep.

38:42.670 --> 38:45.104
I don't understand why.

38:45.139 --> 38:47.140
There's a bond between brothers.

38:47.175 --> 38:50.277
If my brother, Hamid, needed me,
I would be there in a second.

38:50.311 --> 38:51.944
That's different.
You risked

38:51.979 --> 38:54.447
your life to go to Iran
because your brother was sick.

38:54.482 --> 38:56.483
Yeah, but what if
Booth's brother needed him?

38:56.517 --> 39:00.620
Jared leaned on Booth
whenever he was in trouble.

39:00.655 --> 39:02.722
Booth and I discussed
this many times.

39:02.756 --> 39:06.959
So, what was he keeping from me?

39:10.597 --> 39:11.798
(elevator bell dings)

39:14.434 --> 39:16.602
Finally. There you are.
What are you doing here?

39:16.636 --> 39:18.004
Waiting for you and praying

39:18.038 --> 39:20.139
you didn't come home
with any holes in you.

39:20.174 --> 39:21.841
Nope. Just the ones
I was born with.

39:21.875 --> 39:23.275
That is unseemly.

39:23.310 --> 39:25.111
But I will still
talk to you.

39:25.145 --> 39:27.278
While you were out,
I did some digging.

39:27.313 --> 39:29.881
All right, anything that
brings us closer to Booth?

39:29.916 --> 39:33.952
No, just info on a certain lady
who's been holding back on us.

39:33.986 --> 39:35.987
Agent Miller?

39:36.022 --> 39:40.291
It turns out Booth isn't the
only agent that's gone missing.

39:40.326 --> 39:44.562
Miller's partner up and
vanished four days ago.

39:44.597 --> 39:46.631
It's not on the wires.

39:46.665 --> 39:48.999
No one knows.
Except you.

39:49.034 --> 39:52.303
Well, let's just say
I have many little birds

39:52.338 --> 39:56.241
in many little trees that
owe me many big, fat favors.

39:56.275 --> 39:59.076
So, why didn't Miller
say anything?

39:59.111 --> 40:02.146
Am I suppose to give you
all the answers? Find out.

40:06.485 --> 40:09.420
So, I swabbed the entire inside
of Masbourian's safe.

40:09.455 --> 40:11.122
We got lucky.
How?

40:11.156 --> 40:13.724
The safe was stuffed
full of currency.

40:13.759 --> 40:15.760
I found trace
particulates of glue.

40:15.794 --> 40:18.528
It's what they use on the bands
to wrap hundred-dollar bills.

40:18.563 --> 40:20.530
They use special
bands to wrap hundreds?

40:20.565 --> 40:23.134
It's a state-of-the-art
safe in a drug lord's house.

40:23.168 --> 40:25.535
I don't think he filled it with fives.
Mm, good point.

40:25.570 --> 40:27.437
There were two million dollars
in there.

40:27.472 --> 40:30.511
Two million? What was Booth
doing in that house?

40:30.535 --> 40:31.341
Wait.

40:31.342 --> 40:34.144
I thought we didn't have proof
that Booth was there.

40:34.178 --> 40:35.945
(computer trilling)

40:37.314 --> 40:38.982
MONTENEGRO:
I mapped the bullet holes

40:39.016 --> 40:41.684
and the blood spatter, and
this is what I figured out.

40:41.718 --> 40:43.586
Directionality and
the placement

40:43.620 --> 40:46.589
of the impact wounds indicate
that it was a five-man team.

40:46.623 --> 40:47.991
That is consistent

40:48.025 --> 40:50.160
with the number
of burner phones they bought.

40:50.194 --> 40:53.362
Well, based on the
angle of fire,

40:53.397 --> 40:55.098
these three men were
in a position

40:55.132 --> 40:56.598
to kill Masbourian
and his crew.

40:56.632 --> 40:58.633
Is one of them Booth?
I don't know.

40:58.668 --> 41:00.435
I've got proof that
Booth was there,

41:00.469 --> 41:02.304
and before you
ask me if I'm sure,

41:02.338 --> 41:03.738
I sequenced the
blood four times.

41:03.773 --> 41:05.774
Blood?!

41:05.809 --> 41:07.475
(sighs)

41:07.510 --> 41:09.178
(simulation gunfire
sound effects playing)

41:10.479 --> 41:12.314
That's Booth
right there.

41:15.618 --> 41:17.485
He was hit.

41:21.523 --> 41:22.790
I mapped the blood.

41:22.825 --> 41:24.591
There was a lot of it.

41:24.626 --> 41:26.093
SAROYAN:
And it's definitely his.

41:26.128 --> 41:28.629
He must have sustained
a major wound.

41:28.663 --> 41:30.998
I'm sorry.

41:31.033 --> 41:33.467
How long does Booth have?
I can't say.

41:33.501 --> 41:37.671
The one thing I know is that
he needs medical attention now.

41:45.848 --> 41:48.215
(groans, sighs)

41:55.156 --> 41:56.789
(groans loudly)

41:56.824 --> 41:58.624
(knocking on door)
MAN: You okay, Booth?

41:58.659 --> 42:00.793
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

42:00.828 --> 42:02.595
(panting)

42:02.629 --> 42:04.464
I'll be right out.

42:04.498 --> 42:06.199

42:11.239 --> 42:13.506

42:16.843 --> 42:18.978
We were getting
worried about you.

42:19.012 --> 42:21.713
Yeah, I'm fine.
It's just a scratch, right?

42:21.748 --> 42:24.549
You don't look fine.

42:25.785 --> 42:27.219
(door squeaks open)

42:27.254 --> 42:29.688
Hey, this man's gut-shot.
He needs a doctor.

42:32.525 --> 42:34.894
No doctors.

42:39.399 --> 42:41.967
You still with us?

42:45.972 --> 42:48.440
Yeah. I'm still with you.

42:48.474 --> 42:50.542
