<b>WELL WISHES</b>

00:23.584 --> 00:26.584
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

00:33.365 --> 00:35.734
Tails!

00:39.704 --> 00:40.506
You wanted to see me, sir?

00:40.539 --> 00:41.673
Yes...

00:41.707 --> 00:43.810
Come on in, Mike.

00:43.843 --> 00:45.478
It's Miles, sir.

00:45.511 --> 00:47.380
Miles?

00:47.412 --> 00:49.581
Are you sure it's not Mike?
I could have sworn it was Mike.

00:49.615 --> 00:52.085
I'm pretty sure.

00:52.118 --> 00:53.753
Okay.

00:53.786 --> 00:56.523
Well take a seat, duly noted.

00:59.524 --> 01:02.427
I'm gonna cut right
to the chase here.

01:02.460 --> 01:04.096
I got some bad news.

01:05.331 --> 01:07.433
We're gonna have to let you go.

01:16.441 --> 01:18.443
I don't understand that, sir.

01:18.477 --> 01:19.712
Is it because of
the Christmas party?

01:19.745 --> 01:21.746
Because I apologize
for my girlfriend.

01:21.780 --> 01:23.748
If it makes any difference, we
received one hell of a rash

01:23.781 --> 01:25.350
from that mistletoe.

01:25.384 --> 01:28.754
No, I thought
that was pretty funny.

01:28.787 --> 01:30.123
But no.
Okay.

01:30.156 --> 01:32.225
This is...

01:32.257 --> 01:33.692
This is just...

01:35.460 --> 01:37.662
What about everything I've
done for this company?

01:37.695 --> 01:40.432
You know, it's
strictly financial,

01:40.465 --> 01:43.301
and I am sorry if this...

01:43.334 --> 01:45.637
If you're screwed by
this, I really am.

01:45.671 --> 01:48.541
But on behalf of the entire
staff, I'd like to invite you

01:48.573 --> 01:50.609
to continue attending
our bi-annual bake-off,

01:50.643 --> 01:52.879
both spring and autumn
sweet and savory categories,

01:52.912 --> 01:56.481
best dish wins a gift certificate
to McGillicutty's Seafood!

01:56.515 --> 01:58.150
Shack.

02:00.686 --> 02:03.523
Did you just decide all
this with that quarter?

02:05.623 --> 02:06.825
What quarter?

02:06.858 --> 02:08.293
Sir, the quarter. You
were just tapping it.

02:08.326 --> 02:09.495
It's in your hand.

02:09.526 --> 02:10.562
It's right in your
hand, right here.

02:10.596 --> 02:12.532
Sir, come on.

02:12.564 --> 02:14.533
I don't like
confrontation, Mike.

02:14.567 --> 02:17.637
It's not my strong suit
and if it were up to me,

02:17.669 --> 02:18.837
everybody could keep their jobs.

02:18.871 --> 02:20.907
It is up to you,
sir, you're the boss.

02:20.939 --> 02:22.641
And you're telling me this
is for financial reasons?

02:22.675 --> 02:23.743
I'm the top-earner.

02:23.776 --> 02:25.344
I'm not into
confrontation, okay?

02:25.377 --> 02:28.314
I am sorry.

02:28.347 --> 02:30.917
Just, don't be a stranger.

02:41.326 --> 02:43.562
You go get 'em, slugger.

02:44.430 --> 02:47.700
And could you send Miles in
when you go outside, please?

02:47.733 --> 02:49.235
I'm Miles, Shane.

02:50.301 --> 02:52.305
Send the next guy in.

02:53.938 --> 02:54.973
Thank you.

02:55.007 --> 02:56.475
Have a good one.

02:58.343 --> 02:59.878
Thanks a lot, buddy.

03:05.484 --> 03:06.885
Yes! Yes!

03:06.919 --> 03:07.620
Yes!

03:07.652 --> 03:10.389
Yes!

03:11.623 --> 03:14.426
I would like to
introduce you all

03:14.460 --> 03:18.798
to the new interim
departmental assistant head

03:18.830 --> 03:21.933
of the regional bureau
of synergy assessment

03:21.967 --> 03:25.538
and strategic alignment, woo!

03:28.774 --> 03:30.475
Hey, sweetie.

03:32.044 --> 03:35.548
I'm making a kale quinoa
and couscous salad tonight.

03:35.580 --> 03:37.515
My favorite.

03:37.549 --> 03:39.418
I got laid off today.

03:39.450 --> 03:41.486
You what?

03:42.854 --> 03:44.590
You what?!

03:46.658 --> 03:49.027
Hey.

03:49.061 --> 03:50.462
What happened?

03:51.830 --> 03:53.733
Look at that, baby,
that's beautiful.

03:53.765 --> 03:54.966
Yeah, I know.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.435
I did this for you.

03:56.467 --> 03:59.471
You got all your
favorite colors.

03:59.504 --> 04:00.705
Do you know why
I even did this?

04:00.739 --> 04:02.408
You don't even know
why I did this.

04:02.441 --> 04:03.943
I was gonna tell you
tonight that you could

04:03.975 --> 04:06.312
take my last name
when we get married.

04:06.344 --> 04:09.048
Which is a big deal, Miles.

04:09.080 --> 04:11.483
You're not even acknowledging
how much that means,

04:11.516 --> 04:13.786
and now it's completely
ruined, obviously.

04:13.818 --> 04:15.287
It's not ruined, I just...

04:15.320 --> 04:16.788
Miles! What are you doing?

04:16.822 --> 04:18.456
Miles.

04:18.490 --> 04:20.026
This is not your hook.

04:20.059 --> 04:21.560
This is your hook.

04:21.593 --> 04:22.494
What even happened?

04:22.528 --> 04:24.530
I'm pretty sure he
decided on a coin toss.

04:24.562 --> 04:25.396
That's ridiculous.

04:25.430 --> 04:26.765
No, I'm
pretty sure he did.

04:26.798 --> 04:28.466
I can't even look
at you right now.

04:28.500 --> 04:29.869
What are you doing with
the decorative pillow?

04:29.901 --> 04:31.603
It's in the negative
space, I'm just...

04:31.637 --> 04:33.773
Miles! You're negative space!

04:33.805 --> 04:35.473
They go by color
and pattern, Miles.

04:35.507 --> 04:36.876
I mean, is it hard?

04:36.908 --> 04:38.310
Is it hard? It's not.
I love you.

04:38.343 --> 04:39.478
Don't touch me.

04:40.579 --> 04:42.581
This is just a prime example

04:42.613 --> 04:46.384
of Miles screws everything up!

04:46.418 --> 04:47.386
All the time!

04:47.418 --> 04:48.320
Just keep the candles goin'.

04:48.353 --> 04:49.421
This night is over with.

04:49.454 --> 04:52.524
There's no cuddling, you're
not giving me a back rub.

04:52.557 --> 04:53.959
-Namaste.
-Namaste.

04:53.992 --> 04:55.193
It's seriously like you do
these things on purpose.

04:55.226 --> 04:58.663
"Melissa, it's gonna be so
beautiful when we get married."

04:58.697 --> 05:00.566
Stop talking to me altogether,

05:00.598 --> 05:02.067
because you're
breathing my cat's air,

05:02.100 --> 05:04.704
and wasting it on
your stupid thoughts!

05:09.675 --> 05:11.677
I love you!

06:08.000 --> 06:09.634
"Dear Melissa,"

06:10.502 --> 06:13.473
Pick up the phone and
I'll give you a baby!

06:16.541 --> 06:22.581
"Dear Melissa...

06:27.052 --> 06:34.026
"Dear Melissa...

06:38.463 --> 06:44.704
"Dear Melissa...

06:52.944 --> 06:55.415
"Dear Melissa..."

07:20.172 --> 07:22.141
Golden pepper.

07:26.011 --> 07:27.246
Alright.

07:27.278 --> 07:28.548
Okay.

07:30.281 --> 07:32.183
Come on.

07:32.216 --> 07:33.786
Come on.

07:38.956 --> 07:40.192
Rip off!
Listen.

07:40.225 --> 07:41.594
Lady Liberty.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.528
I sell 'em, I don't
make 'em, all right?

07:43.562 --> 07:44.896
Move along.

07:44.930 --> 07:46.165
No.

07:46.197 --> 07:47.233
Pennies make dollars.

07:47.266 --> 07:49.001
It's common sense!

09:22.628 --> 09:23.930
Jack?

09:29.067 --> 09:30.336
-Coins...
-Yeah.

09:30.369 --> 09:31.336
From wishing wells...?

09:31.370 --> 09:32.238
Yeah.

09:33.672 --> 09:35.274
I'm serious, man.

09:35.307 --> 09:37.209
Listen, all the municipalities,

09:37.241 --> 09:38.309
they don't have enough
budget these days,

09:38.342 --> 09:40.979
to send people out to take
care of the local fountains.

09:42.648 --> 09:44.716
So we can come in, help
out the local governments,

09:44.750 --> 09:45.918
even give more money to charity

09:45.951 --> 09:47.385
than what they typically get.

09:47.418 --> 09:49.654
And then we keep
everything on top of that,

09:49.687 --> 09:51.322
which is gonna be a
nice chunk of change.

09:51.355 --> 09:53.391
We haven't talked in
weeks and you call me up

09:53.424 --> 09:55.860
out of the blue with
this, with a Ponzi scheme?

09:55.894 --> 09:58.297
First up, it's not a
Ponzi scheme, all right?

09:58.330 --> 10:01.367
Second off, I was
embarrassed, man.

10:01.399 --> 10:04.403
Well why would
you be embarrassed?

10:07.072 --> 10:08.072
I should have
called you, I'm sorry.

10:08.105 --> 10:09.107
It's cool. I get it.

10:09.140 --> 10:10.341
Don't apologize.

10:10.375 --> 10:13.011
We can be our own bosses,

10:13.044 --> 10:14.312
then we can go ahead and
enjoy the liberating freedom

10:14.346 --> 10:15.346
we've always talked about.

10:15.379 --> 10:17.015
Is it legal?

10:17.048 --> 10:18.850
Of course it's legal. I've
Googled it, Binged, Yahooed it.

10:18.884 --> 10:19.884
I even asked Jeeves.

10:19.918 --> 10:21.086
Who the hell's Jeeves?

10:21.119 --> 10:22.086
Well, I tried to ask
Jeeves but I don't think

10:22.120 --> 10:24.389
he's around anymore or
else he just goes by Ask.

10:24.423 --> 10:26.725
I must've... missed
the Jeeves train.

10:26.758 --> 10:27.993
Come on, buddy.

10:28.025 --> 10:29.260
You and me?

10:29.293 --> 10:31.096
This is our ticket.

10:31.129 --> 10:32.431
When are you thinking
of starting this thing?

10:32.464 --> 10:33.899
Tonight.

10:37.735 --> 10:39.004
I'm talkin' about
makin' money, man.

10:39.037 --> 10:41.774
Makin' a lot of money.

10:41.807 --> 10:43.442
Do you know how messed
up it is out there?

10:43.475 --> 10:45.144
You should know how
messed up it is out there.

10:45.177 --> 10:47.879
I picked you up wearing a
dress and a foam hat today.

10:47.913 --> 10:49.447
People are struggling
to find jobs.

10:49.480 --> 10:51.149
It is a privilege to have a job.

10:51.182 --> 10:53.985
And I'm glad that
I have one, Miles.

10:54.019 --> 10:55.721
Okay, as much fun as
I know it would be,

10:55.754 --> 10:57.423
I just do not have the stamina

10:57.456 --> 10:58.456
for these kinds
of games anymore.

10:58.490 --> 11:00.324
This is an opportunity,
a legitimate opportunity

11:00.357 --> 11:01.359
with infinite potential.

11:01.393 --> 11:03.162
You sound like
Jerry from work.

11:03.195 --> 11:04.763
Enough about
Jerry, will you stop?

11:04.796 --> 11:06.198
You always talk about Jerry.

11:06.230 --> 11:07.932
Just, "Jerry Jerry Jerry,"
you're like so obsessed

11:07.966 --> 11:09.435
with freakin' Jerry, just,

11:09.467 --> 11:11.437
look at the stars.

11:11.470 --> 11:13.205
Jerry.

11:17.975 --> 11:20.046
Why don't you
just think about it?

11:21.178 --> 11:22.179
Okay.

11:22.214 --> 11:24.717
You're out of your gourd
but I will think about it.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.384
Don't hurt yourself.

11:29.788 --> 11:31.255
Gotta go.
Reach for it!

11:31.288 --> 11:32.758
Reach for the stars, buddy!

12:36.120 --> 12:37.355
Lady Liberty.

12:37.389 --> 12:38.823
Golden Pepper scratch off?

12:38.856 --> 12:42.093
Nope, actually
just a coffee today.

12:52.269 --> 12:53.304
You know what?

12:53.337 --> 12:56.908
Actually I'll take 20 of 'em.

13:01.446 --> 13:02.346
Change?

13:02.379 --> 13:03.481
Yeah, I got some,

13:03.514 --> 13:05.384
I got some change.

13:08.953 --> 13:10.288
I got this too.

13:10.322 --> 13:12.256
Take good care of this, this is

13:12.289 --> 13:13.991
actually what's been keeping
me off the streets too,

13:14.024 --> 13:15.494
if you can believe that, sir.

13:16.427 --> 13:18.297
There you go.

13:18.330 --> 13:19.898
These are for you too.

13:19.931 --> 13:22.301
I don't much play the lottery,

13:23.567 --> 13:25.136
but thank you.

13:25.169 --> 13:26.370
God bless you.

13:26.403 --> 13:32.443
Good luck, sir.

13:38.115 --> 13:39.884
Have we met before?

13:39.918 --> 13:41.921
You look familiar.

13:43.421 --> 13:44.355
Okay.

13:44.389 --> 13:45.957
Well maybe you can help me out.

13:45.990 --> 13:46.958
I'm trying to figure out
where all the fountains are

13:46.991 --> 13:47.625
around here.

13:47.658 --> 13:48.626
Fountains?

13:48.659 --> 13:50.495
Yeah, wishing fountains.

13:51.629 --> 13:54.232
Architectural
enthusiast, are we?

13:54.265 --> 13:55.399
Just a growing interest.

13:56.467 --> 13:59.203
My name is Miles, sir.

13:59.236 --> 14:00.338
Durwood.

14:00.371 --> 14:02.907
Pleasure to meet you, Durwood.

14:02.941 --> 14:03.908
Nice ride.

14:03.942 --> 14:04.876
Thank you, thank you.

14:04.909 --> 14:07.312
It's a '57 wagon, obviously.

14:07.345 --> 14:08.947
I know.

14:08.980 --> 14:10.014
I had a coupe.

14:10.048 --> 14:10.948
Really?

14:10.981 --> 14:11.949
First car.

14:11.982 --> 14:12.984
Yeah?

14:13.018 --> 14:14.485
That's cool.

14:14.519 --> 14:15.953
Yeah, everything's
original in this one.

14:15.986 --> 14:18.155
Interior, engine, all
the numbers are right.

14:18.188 --> 14:19.357
It's been in the
family a long time.

14:19.390 --> 14:21.360
It's been in a good family.

14:22.394 --> 14:23.995
All right well,

14:24.028 --> 14:26.465
I hope you win big with those.

14:31.135 --> 14:34.472
Hey Miles.

14:34.505 --> 14:37.009
Thanks for the generosity.

14:38.143 --> 14:40.012
You take care, sir.

15:30.260 --> 15:32.029
Hi!
Hey.

15:32.062 --> 15:32.997
Brought you a coffee.

15:33.030 --> 15:33.631
Thanks, man.

15:33.664 --> 15:35.567
Come on in, come on in.

15:40.138 --> 15:42.240
You're livin' it up!

15:42.273 --> 15:43.608
Making pillow forts again?

15:43.640 --> 15:45.509
Of course I've been
makin' pillow forts.

15:45.543 --> 15:47.446
Shouldn't you be at work?

15:47.479 --> 15:49.081
If I had a job.

15:49.114 --> 15:50.014
I quit.

15:50.048 --> 15:51.283
Okay, all right.

15:51.316 --> 15:52.350
Why...

15:52.384 --> 15:54.119
Okay, why'd you quit?

15:54.152 --> 15:55.387
I thought
you'd be excited.

15:55.419 --> 15:56.721
No, I just thought
that you liked that job,

15:56.754 --> 15:58.389
what are talkin' about?

15:58.423 --> 16:00.325
Yeah, I did like that job,
or I thought I liked that job,

16:00.357 --> 16:03.361
or I was pretending
to like my job but,

16:03.394 --> 16:05.764
I don't like my job.

16:05.797 --> 16:07.766
I don't like pretending
that Jerry Wunderlick's

16:07.798 --> 16:10.201
jokes are funny, I don't
like the cookie-cutter cards

16:10.235 --> 16:12.269
that I've got to put on
those shelves every day

16:12.302 --> 16:14.306
and they're not letting me
put my own stuff up there?

16:14.339 --> 16:16.008
I'm being artistically
repressed.

16:16.041 --> 16:17.475
That's their loss, Jack.

16:17.509 --> 16:19.177
Then I started thinking about
everything that you've been

16:19.210 --> 16:21.580
saying about creating
something of our own.

16:21.613 --> 16:24.449
Something adventurous,
something unique.

16:24.481 --> 16:28.352
About, the liberating freedom.

16:28.385 --> 16:29.721
And I realized, that's
what I'm missing.

16:29.754 --> 16:32.758
That's what I don't
have, that's what I need.

16:32.791 --> 16:34.493
It's what I want.

16:34.525 --> 16:37.428
So, I mean...

16:37.461 --> 16:39.497
Even if we fail,

16:39.530 --> 16:43.201
I'm in.

16:47.438 --> 16:48.572
Are we gonna do this?

16:48.605 --> 16:50.442
Okay, okay.

16:52.409 --> 16:54.413
Yeah, I'm a big bear.

16:58.249 --> 17:00.719
It's beautiful.
I know, I know.

17:00.751 --> 17:03.187
I had a cousin that
once peed a penny.

17:03.221 --> 17:04.321
Is that weird?

17:04.355 --> 17:05.523
It's not weird
at all, it's money.

17:05.557 --> 17:07.125
I want 'em up my nose...
What?

17:07.156 --> 17:08.492
Down my throat.

17:08.526 --> 17:10.228
Okay, that's you, man.

17:10.260 --> 17:13.263
Royal sovereign FS44P.

17:14.432 --> 17:16.535
I think we got the king
of coin counters right here.

17:16.567 --> 17:17.435
Look at that hopper!

17:17.469 --> 17:20.638
800 coin capacity,
300 coins per minute.

17:20.672 --> 17:24.442
18,000 an hour.

17:28.645 --> 17:29.681
We're gonna need more of these.

17:29.713 --> 17:30.581
Well that's the goal.

17:30.615 --> 17:32.284
That's the goal.

17:32.317 --> 17:34.086
All right.

17:34.118 --> 17:36.221
Tomorrow we hit up
a fountain together.

17:36.253 --> 17:37.721
Then after that we split
up to cover more ground.

17:37.755 --> 17:39.157
Yeah, got it.

17:39.190 --> 17:40.592
Now, what do you do if
the police come around?

17:40.625 --> 17:44.395
Tell them the truth, but no
more than they need to know.

17:44.429 --> 17:45.697
Routine cleaning.

17:45.730 --> 17:47.098
When you're finished?

17:47.132 --> 17:49.500
Leave five dollars
in pennies and nickels,

17:49.534 --> 17:51.303
to encourage replenishment.

17:51.336 --> 17:52.671
I got this.

17:54.506 --> 17:57.109
You remember that
cold-ass winter?

17:57.142 --> 17:59.878
Like '86, '87?

17:59.911 --> 18:01.712
I do.

18:01.746 --> 18:04.383
This ain't gonna end
up like that, is it?

18:06.351 --> 18:07.452
No.

18:07.484 --> 18:08.820
Not at all.

19:19.490 --> 19:21.626
Do you feel like
a million bucks?

19:24.429 --> 19:27.332
'Cause you look like
a million bucks.

19:38.742 --> 19:40.412
We knew this day would come.

19:40.444 --> 19:44.249
Maybe about a month
before they're replenished?

19:44.281 --> 19:45.383
At least.

19:45.416 --> 19:47.551
High traffic zones might fill
up sooner, but who knows.

19:47.585 --> 19:48.819
What do you think?

19:48.853 --> 19:49.653
Break for a few months
and hope people start

19:49.686 --> 19:51.288
wishing more than ever?

19:51.321 --> 19:53.924
Nah, at this point we
either buckle or we boom.

19:53.958 --> 19:55.360
Boom!

19:55.893 --> 19:57.328
In the morning I'll call around,

19:57.362 --> 19:59.397
check all the
statewide registries.

19:59.430 --> 20:01.466
If there's a fountain to
be farmed, we'll find it.

20:01.499 --> 20:03.468
Midweek, get you a
firm route planned out.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.470
Well you're coming along
with me on this one, right?

20:05.502 --> 20:06.704
No man, you're the collector.

20:06.738 --> 20:08.573
Nah, you gotta come
along on this one, man.

20:08.605 --> 20:12.277
This is your
journey, my friend.

20:12.309 --> 20:14.678
You must venture alone
into the unknown night

20:14.711 --> 20:17.816
with only brother
moon, sister sun,

20:17.848 --> 20:22.386
there can only be two
moccasins upon your path.

20:22.420 --> 20:24.256
Besides, somebody's
gotta stick around,

20:24.288 --> 20:26.490
make sure this ship
doesn't capsize.

20:26.523 --> 20:27.791
We really got something.

20:27.825 --> 20:29.427
We do, don't we?

20:29.460 --> 20:31.596
So if you're gonna be on
the road and I'm stuck here,

20:31.628 --> 20:34.498
I'm thinking maybe we could
use an extra hand around here

20:34.531 --> 20:38.269
to help out at least with
the investment ideas.

20:38.303 --> 20:39.471
No, no.

20:39.503 --> 20:42.373
That's a lot of numbers
for this brain, man.

20:43.374 --> 20:44.276
One.

20:44.308 --> 20:45.042
All right maybe, maybe.

20:45.076 --> 20:47.746
Just one, one guy or gal, okay?

20:47.778 --> 20:48.946
One.

20:48.980 --> 20:49.881
One. That's all
I'm talkin' about.

20:49.913 --> 20:51.316
All right.

20:51.348 --> 20:54.019
I'll set up the
interviews this week.

20:54.051 --> 20:56.920
You know what, actually,
forget about the interviews.

20:56.953 --> 20:58.889
I got a better idea.

20:58.923 --> 20:59.990
That guy? That's
your better idea?

21:00.023 --> 21:02.559
Yeah, I had an intense
experience with this guy, man.

21:02.593 --> 21:03.694
I just, I got a good
feeling about him.

21:03.728 --> 21:06.564
That's a bona fide Scooby
Doo villain over there, man.

21:06.596 --> 21:07.598
Do you not trust me?

21:07.632 --> 21:08.365
This is reckless!

21:08.400 --> 21:10.067
Jack, just trust
me on this one.

21:10.101 --> 21:12.671
I see something in this guy.

21:12.703 --> 21:14.638
It's called Hepatitis-C,
it's yellowing of the eyes...

21:14.672 --> 21:16.908
No, it's not Hepatitis.

21:16.941 --> 21:18.375
-Is it scabies?
-No scabies.

21:18.409 --> 21:19.611
No rabies.

21:19.644 --> 21:21.846
I see genuine goodness
in this guy, okay?

21:21.878 --> 21:23.380
Not but four weeks ago
there was a fine line

21:23.413 --> 21:24.615
between me and him.

21:24.648 --> 21:26.884
He deserves a second
chance, Jack, and,

21:26.917 --> 21:29.353
we're in a position
to give it to him.

21:30.587 --> 21:32.790
Can you just roll
with me on this?

21:32.824 --> 21:33.725
You ready?

21:34.892 --> 21:36.995
Jesus.

21:37.028 --> 21:38.563
Okay, I'll give you
the Scooby Doo villain.

21:38.596 --> 21:39.530
Thank you.

21:39.564 --> 21:41.800
Miles with the fountains.

21:41.833 --> 21:43.067
And the ride.

21:43.101 --> 21:44.469
You remember.

21:44.501 --> 21:49.073
Age has dulled my sense
of humor, young man.

21:49.106 --> 21:50.642
Not my memory.

21:50.674 --> 21:53.010
How did those lottery
tickets treat you?

21:53.044 --> 21:54.512
Got flipped off a lot.

21:55.579 --> 21:56.681
Thanks for the gesture.

21:56.713 --> 21:58.549
Anytime, here, I got...

21:58.583 --> 22:00.785
Nah, never twice.

22:00.817 --> 22:02.487
But you...

22:02.519 --> 22:04.489
Sir?

22:04.521 --> 22:06.423
Fresh out, sorry.

22:18.469 --> 22:21.807
A little something for
the night train fund.

22:23.941 --> 22:25.777
Durwood, do you enjoy this?

22:25.809 --> 22:30.115
I suppose you
mean my situation?

22:31.816 --> 22:33.384
Yeah.

22:33.984 --> 22:37.154
If you wanna see the best
and worst in people,

22:37.188 --> 22:39.591
just ask them to part

22:39.624 --> 22:42.126
with some of their
hard-earned cash.

22:42.160 --> 22:43.495
I believe it's called begging.

22:43.528 --> 22:44.429
Asking.

22:44.461 --> 22:46.530
I didn't get your name.

22:46.564 --> 22:48.066
Jack, Durwood.

22:48.098 --> 22:50.467
Durwood, Jack.

22:50.500 --> 22:51.668
Pardon Jack.

22:51.701 --> 22:53.872
So what brings you
gentlemen out here?

22:53.904 --> 22:56.875
Actually we wanted
to offer you a job.

22:58.075 --> 23:01.179
If you haven't
noticed, I'm retired.

23:02.946 --> 23:04.982
Why's that funny?

23:05.750 --> 23:08.553
Durwood, I can tell
you're an honest man.

23:08.586 --> 23:11.722
I don't think I
would work for anybody

23:11.756 --> 23:13.892
who would hire a stranger.

23:13.924 --> 23:16.961
Aren't all hirees
strangers at first?

23:16.993 --> 23:18.596
Yeah, but I
might be dangerous.

23:18.628 --> 23:20.598
But you're not
dangerous, are you?

23:22.900 --> 23:24.134
No.

23:24.167 --> 23:25.569
All right.

23:25.603 --> 23:26.336
Well, you wouldn't
be working for us.

23:26.371 --> 23:28.640
You'd be working
with us, Durwood.

23:29.941 --> 23:33.778
And what would that line
of work be, if I might ask?

23:34.612 --> 23:36.915
Coins.

23:41.117 --> 23:43.620
Miles with the fountains.

23:43.653 --> 23:47.090
First you must
incorporate. We must.

23:47.124 --> 23:49.160
To be a legitimate
business you have to have

23:49.192 --> 23:51.996
a legitimate business. There's
gonna be a grey zone in state

23:52.028 --> 23:55.232
and federal taxes but I can
take care of that.

23:55.266 --> 23:58.102
I'll need you to get records
from every harvest site

23:58.134 --> 23:59.903
and receipts, I can't
stress it enough.

23:59.936 --> 24:01.805
You gotta keep every receipt.

24:01.838 --> 24:04.708
We'll start with some
high-interest CD accounts

24:04.741 --> 24:09.580
then we'll go long into fiber
optics, scratch-proof glass,

24:09.614 --> 24:13.218
real estate, maybe,
down the road.

24:13.250 --> 24:16.721
I predict we'll
milk 23 cents out of

24:16.753 --> 24:18.655
every penny you bring back.

24:18.689 --> 24:19.791
Well, I mean, that's...

24:23.861 --> 24:28.032
Can we change out this
city map for a state map?

24:28.065 --> 24:30.134
So we can follow
you on your trip.

24:30.166 --> 24:31.935
I'm sorry, is this going
a little fast for you?

24:31.969 --> 24:33.104
'Cause it is for me.

24:33.136 --> 24:34.705
I mean, we hardly know this guy.

24:34.739 --> 24:35.906
I don't know you.

24:35.940 --> 24:38.009
So I guess I have a
few questions like,

24:38.041 --> 24:39.276
I don't know, why you
smell like burritos,

24:39.309 --> 24:41.044
what's up with your hair?

24:41.077 --> 24:43.181
And if you're such a
brilliant businessman,

24:43.213 --> 24:45.049
how'd you become homeless?

24:47.117 --> 24:51.623
I ended up in the position
I find myself in today,

24:51.655 --> 24:55.659
after a series of decisions.

24:55.692 --> 24:59.263
Decisions with
which I am at peace.

25:01.265 --> 25:03.668
But I'm not homeless, young man.

25:07.305 --> 25:09.307
Can I crash here while
we get this thing going?

25:13.678 --> 25:14.812
Okay, brother.

25:14.845 --> 25:15.613
We're going all
the way with this.

25:15.645 --> 25:17.648
That's right, buddy.

25:17.682 --> 25:18.916
All right.

25:18.950 --> 25:21.052
All right, the receipts
and the release forms,

25:21.085 --> 25:22.754
and all the paperwork,
I'll make sure to have it

25:22.787 --> 25:25.856
and you just gotta keep Jack
in line and we'll be all right.

25:25.890 --> 25:27.992
Yeah.

25:28.025 --> 25:30.662
And I'll try to keep
Durwood out of the garbage.

25:30.694 --> 25:32.062
Drive safe.

25:32.096 --> 25:33.197
All right, that wasn't nice.

25:33.230 --> 25:34.699
That wasn't nice to say at all.

25:34.731 --> 25:36.768
I apologize for him.

25:36.800 --> 25:40.637
But he'll come around and
he'll see what we see, okay?

25:40.671 --> 25:42.140
He's smart.

25:43.907 --> 25:45.709
I wouldn't have hired me either.

25:47.811 --> 25:50.080
Well Durwood,
I just trust you.

25:50.114 --> 25:52.717
Life's a lot easier that
way, you know what I mean?

25:52.750 --> 25:54.852
So you just do your thing,
and we'll have ourselves

25:54.884 --> 25:58.088
a legitimate business
on our hands, okay?

25:58.122 --> 25:59.190
You got it, boss.

25:59.222 --> 26:00.290
No, no.

26:00.324 --> 26:02.259
No boss, none of this...

26:02.292 --> 26:03.961
This, you know, this is...

26:03.994 --> 26:04.962
You know what I mean?

26:04.996 --> 26:06.163
No boss, no boss.

26:06.196 --> 26:07.598
I'll talk to you
later, all right?

26:08.798 --> 26:10.033
Here we go!

26:10.034 --> 26:11.336
We're doin' it!

26:29.686 --> 26:31.121
We need some

26:33.057 --> 26:34.692
better furniture.

26:50.106 --> 26:52.143
I'll get right
on that, Durwood.

27:02.686 --> 27:03.554
When?

28:14.491 --> 28:15.460
Hello.

28:16.493 --> 28:18.028
Hello yourself.

28:29.539 --> 28:32.409
Sorry, I didn't mean
to sneak up on you.

28:32.442 --> 28:34.445
I was just leaving.

28:52.896 --> 28:54.965
What'd you wish for?

28:56.534 --> 28:59.470
If I tell you, doesn't
it void the wish?

28:59.502 --> 29:01.472
No, actually.

29:02.873 --> 29:04.342
As soon as your
coin hits the water,

29:04.375 --> 29:07.511
it registers with the
wish distributors.

29:07.545 --> 29:08.346
Besides, you know, when
it comes to wishes,

29:08.378 --> 29:10.814
it's not the coin
that matters anyway.

29:20.990 --> 29:22.493
Are you superstitious?

29:24.461 --> 29:26.998
Yeah, yeah I've knocked
on my fair share of wood.

29:27.030 --> 29:30.067
Then would you mind
leaving mine in there?

29:30.099 --> 29:34.105
Just in case.

29:38.442 --> 29:39.911
Which one is it?

29:43.314 --> 29:43.980
It's that one.

29:44.013 --> 29:46.049
It's that one?

29:48.318 --> 29:51.221
You know what,
actually it's...

29:53.557 --> 29:54.290
Yeah.

29:54.325 --> 29:57.260
Yeah, it's my
lunchtime, actually.

29:59.128 --> 30:01.398
It's a really nice day out.

30:01.432 --> 30:04.969
You seem like equally
a nice person.

30:05.001 --> 30:06.403
Why don't you take a walk
with me around the park

30:06.436 --> 30:11.008
and I'll spare your
coin another day?

30:15.479 --> 30:16.480
Why not.

30:18.048 --> 30:19.416
Why not.

30:20.517 --> 30:21.820
All right.

30:23.319 --> 30:26.223
It must be nice to
work here every day.

30:27.557 --> 30:29.026
Plenty of fresh air...

30:30.259 --> 30:32.864
You get to watch the seasons
change right before you eyes.

30:32.896 --> 30:34.432
Yeah about that?

30:34.464 --> 30:37.934
I I don't mean
to mislead you

30:37.968 --> 30:40.337
but I don't work for the park.

30:40.371 --> 30:41.639
Who do you work for?

30:41.672 --> 30:43.140
Myself.

30:43.173 --> 30:44.474
-Yourself?
-Yeah.

30:44.508 --> 30:45.910
Then what is...

30:47.411 --> 30:49.013
What were you...

30:49.480 --> 30:51.115
What?

30:51.147 --> 30:52.916
Just consider me
one of the world's

30:52.950 --> 30:54.885
most active coin collectors.

30:54.919 --> 30:57.221
-Come on.
-No, I'm serious.

30:57.253 --> 30:57.954
You're pulling my leg.

30:57.988 --> 30:59.457
No.

30:59.490 --> 31:00.391
Seriously?

31:00.423 --> 31:02.093
Seriously, seriously!

31:04.461 --> 31:07.064
So you make a living here?

31:07.096 --> 31:10.166
Yeah, well here,
there, you know.

31:10.200 --> 31:11.501
Everywhere.

31:13.136 --> 31:15.105
That is crazy.

31:19.410 --> 31:21.211
So what were you before this?

31:21.244 --> 31:23.447
Miserable.

31:24.580 --> 31:26.917
And now?

31:26.951 --> 31:28.553
Making progress.

31:38.095 --> 31:39.596
All right what about you?

31:39.630 --> 31:42.466
What are you doing
out here on a,

31:42.499 --> 31:43.701
Tuesday?

31:43.733 --> 31:45.336
-Wednesday.
-Wednesday.

31:45.368 --> 31:46.303
Close.

31:48.471 --> 31:50.508
Well, besides the obvious?

31:51.275 --> 31:52.643
The fresh air.

31:52.675 --> 31:54.412
The sights.

31:57.548 --> 31:59.717
I used to come here
when I was a kid.

31:59.750 --> 32:01.551
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

32:02.385 --> 32:05.522
But now I'm just, you
know, passing through.

32:08.192 --> 32:10.060
Travelling the state.

32:10.760 --> 32:12.495
A vacation, sort of.

32:12.528 --> 32:13.297
Okay.

32:13.329 --> 32:15.398
Getting off the
grid for a while.

32:15.432 --> 32:18.602
The grid?

32:18.634 --> 32:20.671
So what about you?

32:20.703 --> 32:23.674
Where do your roots end?

32:24.674 --> 32:26.242
The grid.

32:27.478 --> 32:29.212
Where are you goin'?

32:29.246 --> 32:30.715
Well that's...

32:30.748 --> 32:34.585
That is a good
question, isn't it?

32:39.256 --> 32:40.291
Well wait.

32:40.324 --> 32:41.392
Wait.

32:41.424 --> 32:45.328
If I'm gonna take anything
away from this conversation,

32:45.362 --> 32:46.998
let it be your name.

32:49.199 --> 32:50.468
Penelope.

32:51.567 --> 32:54.238
Miles.

32:58.474 --> 33:00.443
As in, like...

33:00.477 --> 33:01.479
No.

33:01.511 --> 33:03.114
As in Ellie, not Penny.

33:03.146 --> 33:04.514
God, wouldn't that be something.

33:04.548 --> 33:05.516
Yeah, it would.

33:07.317 --> 33:08.251
All right.

33:08.285 --> 33:09.452
Okay.

33:09.486 --> 33:13.124
Well, did you...

33:13.156 --> 33:15.225
Quarter, dime, nickel?

33:15.259 --> 33:15.659
Your wish.

33:15.692 --> 33:17.528
Penny.

33:17.560 --> 33:18.428
Of course.

33:20.463 --> 33:21.598
All right well I'm gonna
be here until about

33:21.632 --> 33:24.567
midnight tonight so I'm gonna
leave all the pennies there

33:24.601 --> 33:27.705
until then and that guarantees
that your wish is heard

33:27.738 --> 33:29.606
and you know, at
the end of the night

33:29.640 --> 33:32.710
I'll have to go in and
swoop 'em all up but,

33:32.742 --> 33:34.744
all will be well.

33:34.778 --> 33:35.578
Okay.

33:35.612 --> 33:37.115
Okay.

33:39.583 --> 33:42.220
Are you gonna be here tomorrow?

33:43.554 --> 33:45.189
I am on vacation.

33:45.823 --> 33:47.492
You never know.

33:49.358 --> 33:50.494
All right.

33:53.463 --> 33:55.298
What'd you wish for?

33:56.599 --> 33:58.735
What we're all wishing for.

34:05.576 --> 34:06.777
What are you doing right now?

34:06.809 --> 34:08.179
Checking the internet.

34:08.210 --> 34:10.748
Making sure you're
not gonna murder me.

34:10.780 --> 34:12.083
What's your last name?

34:12.114 --> 34:13.717
I need you to get
these notarized.

34:13.750 --> 34:16.554
I gotta check out
fountain progress.

34:22.159 --> 34:23.427
Miles, what's up!

34:23.460 --> 34:24.661
Hey, buddy.

34:24.695 --> 34:26.496
One week without
our fearless leader.

34:26.530 --> 34:27.431
Good news on your end?

34:27.465 --> 34:29.266
If things keep going
the way they're going,

34:29.297 --> 34:32.168
we're gonna retire by the
end of next year, brother.

34:32.202 --> 34:33.637
You guys should be receiving
some packages from me

34:33.670 --> 34:34.871
by the end of the week, okay?

34:34.905 --> 34:38.476
And I am currently
one day behind.

34:38.509 --> 34:40.110
All right. Everything okay?

34:40.143 --> 34:42.346
I'm just gonna spend the
night here in zone seven

34:42.378 --> 34:43.746
and then I'll make
everything up tomorrow.

34:43.780 --> 34:46.750
Remember, you're
on CEO time now, buddy

34:46.782 --> 34:48.451
so just pace yourself.

34:48.485 --> 34:49.420
You pace yourself.

34:49.452 --> 34:51.422
Listen, didn't mean
to mention it but I got

34:51.454 --> 34:52.590
some ideas I wanna run by you.

34:52.623 --> 34:53.724
I can't wait to hear 'em!

34:53.757 --> 34:56.525
You wanna just give 'em to
me in detail when I get back?

34:56.559 --> 34:57.795
Sure sure.

34:57.827 --> 34:59.496
Happy treasuring, my friend.

34:59.530 --> 35:03.801
Talk to you soon.

35:08.639 --> 35:09.874
So?

35:09.907 --> 35:11.575
So what?

35:11.608 --> 35:13.344
So, how's he doing?

35:13.376 --> 35:15.445
Well, Miles is
doing well, Durwood.

35:15.478 --> 35:18.781
Thank you for asking, I
appreciate your concern.

35:18.815 --> 35:20.317
Do you have a problem?

35:20.349 --> 35:21.451
Yeah.

35:21.485 --> 35:23.487
Matter of fact.

35:23.519 --> 35:26.456
Just because you know your
way around the legal landscape

35:26.489 --> 35:28.424
doesn't mean we're friends.

35:28.458 --> 35:29.793
Damn sure doesn't
mean I trust you.

35:29.826 --> 35:31.161
Miles does.

35:31.195 --> 35:33.231
Miles isn't right
about everything.

35:34.697 --> 35:36.466
You trust him?

35:38.402 --> 35:39.403
Yes I do.

35:39.436 --> 35:41.838
Then give me a chance.

35:41.871 --> 35:43.373
I'm here to help.

35:43.407 --> 35:47.211
Have some fun in the process.

35:47.244 --> 35:48.846
I don't need to be here.

35:48.878 --> 35:50.514
What, are you gonna
go back to your job

35:50.547 --> 35:53.184
haunting the
abandoned mineshaft?

35:54.518 --> 35:56.487
Maybe.

36:00.523 --> 36:03.728
I have some ideas, on R&D.

36:04.728 --> 36:07.764
Think we can make Miles'
life a little bit easier.

36:07.797 --> 36:11.234
We'd have to hire somebody
though, freelance, of course.

36:11.268 --> 36:12.570
Can you get on board?

36:12.603 --> 36:15.840
We all agreed not
to hire anybody.

36:18.976 --> 36:21.612
But I'll trust you.

36:21.644 --> 36:25.715
We'll break it to Miles later.

36:49.639 --> 36:51.775
I'm sorry!

36:51.807 --> 36:53.876
I'm sorry, are you okay?

36:53.909 --> 36:54.877
Yeah?

36:56.346 --> 36:59.282
-Here.
-Yeah.

37:01.518 --> 37:02.952
You got me good!

37:02.985 --> 37:05.655
You know, I was hoping to run
into you, I just, you know,

37:05.688 --> 37:06.824
not quite...

37:06.856 --> 37:08.559
Like that.

37:08.592 --> 37:10.394
You almost missed me.

37:10.427 --> 37:11.795
I was just packing up.

37:11.827 --> 37:12.929
Really?

37:14.431 --> 37:16.266
Where were you headed?

37:18.768 --> 37:22.272
Just looking to put some asphalt
between me and my problems.

37:22.306 --> 37:23.740
I see.

37:23.773 --> 37:25.409
Well...

37:27.443 --> 37:32.650
They're never quite as bad
as they seem to be?

37:36.619 --> 37:40.423
All right, this may
seem absolutely bonkers

37:40.456 --> 37:42.525
since we're pretty
much strangers...

37:42.559 --> 37:44.295
Well isn't everybody?

37:44.327 --> 37:46.463
Yeah, at first, right?

37:50.500 --> 37:52.302
Why don't you ride with me?

37:53.903 --> 37:55.373
What?

37:56.373 --> 37:58.608
I mean, there's plenty
of fresh air out there.

37:58.641 --> 37:59.909
You know, if you're
looking for change,

37:59.943 --> 38:01.845
you just gotta know
where to find it.

38:01.878 --> 38:03.646
It makes sense.

38:03.679 --> 38:05.748
To coin a phrase.

38:05.782 --> 38:08.586
Hurry fast or I'm about
to turn on a dime.

38:09.853 --> 38:10.921
I'll keep 'em coming.

38:12.489 --> 38:14.525
Quarter.

38:17.059 --> 38:19.329
You do have my coin, right?

38:19.362 --> 38:20.563
I do.

38:21.597 --> 38:23.701
So I guess that
makes me a shareholder.

38:23.733 --> 38:24.835
It does.

38:24.867 --> 38:27.503
I guess I could ride along and

38:27.536 --> 38:29.072
keep tabs on my investment.

38:29.106 --> 38:30.808
Yeah?

38:32.943 --> 38:34.345
Okay!

38:34.378 --> 38:36.713
You better be a
normal dude, though.

38:36.746 --> 38:39.482
I'm just a dude bein'
normal in a light-blue onesie!

38:39.516 --> 38:41.485
Out in public!

38:41.518 --> 38:43.454
All right, where to?

38:50.527 --> 38:51.494
You wanna pick
on the other side.

38:51.527 --> 38:52.862
It's not going through, okay.

38:52.896 --> 38:54.932
Okay, you wanna, okay...

38:56.500 --> 38:57.434
Think
you'd fit in here?

38:57.467 --> 38:58.469
Yep.

39:18.688 --> 39:20.523
I need this job so I
can pay off people.

39:20.556 --> 39:22.592
They won't be coming
here though, I promise.

39:22.626 --> 39:24.495
I trust you.

40:33.896 --> 40:37.201
You know, that fancy phone
has a fancy map on there too.

40:37.233 --> 40:39.635
But, this is a treasure map.

40:39.668 --> 40:40.871
Okay?

40:40.903 --> 40:42.172
You don't do that
on a treasure map.

40:42.204 --> 40:43.940
You gotta lay it out, like this.

40:43.974 --> 40:45.709
Then you trace it.

40:45.742 --> 40:47.144
Okay.

40:47.177 --> 40:53.584
I'm gonna go load up
on some junk food.

40:57.887 --> 40:58.688
All right.

41:03.960 --> 41:04.661
Hello!

41:04.693 --> 41:06.163
Hey, partner.

41:06.195 --> 41:08.565
Keep up the good work, man,
we're rollin' in dough here.

41:08.597 --> 41:10.601
It's gonna get deeper
because we are actually

41:10.634 --> 41:11.835
ahead of schedule now.

41:11.867 --> 41:12.568
Really?

41:12.601 --> 41:13.536
Yeah.

41:13.570 --> 41:15.806
Jack listen.

41:15.838 --> 41:18.942
I I have to
tell you something.

41:20.876 --> 41:22.679
I hired someone.

41:27.583 --> 41:28.751
Who is he?

41:28.784 --> 41:31.687
He is a she and
her name is Penelope.

41:31.721 --> 41:34.157
Penelope? Woohoohoohoo!

41:34.190 --> 41:36.559
I I met her at
zone number seven,

41:36.592 --> 41:38.728
and yeah.

41:38.762 --> 41:40.898
All right I'm not gonna
give you too much hell,

41:40.931 --> 41:43.634
just tell me this,
is she worth it?

41:43.666 --> 41:45.302
Wahoo!

41:48.605 --> 41:52.208
I do believe so.

41:52.242 --> 41:53.310
Okay.

41:53.342 --> 41:54.911
All right then.

41:54.945 --> 41:56.179
You're taking this a
hell of a lot better than I

41:56.211 --> 41:58.681
thought you would.

41:58.715 --> 42:00.117
Do you trust me, Miles?

42:00.150 --> 42:01.918
Of course I trust you.

42:01.952 --> 42:02.986
The feeling is mutual.

42:03.018 --> 42:04.620
I'm sure you had good reasons.

42:04.653 --> 42:07.090
Yeah, I had very good reasons.

42:07.123 --> 42:08.625
But she's the last one.

42:08.657 --> 42:09.893
No más.

42:10.760 --> 42:11.662
Cool cool.

42:11.695 --> 42:13.931
Well, I gotta get back to it.

42:13.963 --> 42:15.965
Got a big surprise waiting
for you when you get back.

42:15.998 --> 42:17.099
Okay, cool.

42:17.132 --> 42:20.903
Well you tell
Durwood I said hello.

42:20.936 --> 42:22.906
All right, sounds good.

42:24.306 --> 42:26.142
That was our fearless leader.

42:33.382 --> 42:35.118
What are you running from?

42:37.219 --> 42:39.756
I'm not running.

42:44.059 --> 42:46.028
I'm just keeping pace.

42:46.061 --> 42:48.097
Okay.

42:48.130 --> 42:49.899
It's a long story.

42:52.068 --> 42:54.772
No actually, it's
not a long story.

42:55.405 --> 42:58.609
I just, I don't want
you to think less of me.

43:01.978 --> 43:04.648
That's impossible, I can
never think less of you.

43:12.222 --> 43:14.725
Someone very close
to me is sick.

43:15.791 --> 43:17.795
She has been for a while.

43:19.663 --> 43:23.233
And I, took a
risk to do something.

43:24.199 --> 43:25.902
I got carried away.

43:27.903 --> 43:30.407
Well, sounds like you
were just trying to do

43:30.440 --> 43:32.175
the right thing.

43:32.208 --> 43:35.378
There's nothing wrong with that.

44:37.474 --> 44:38.242
Right.

44:38.275 --> 44:41.010
Checks and sandwich
time, gentlemen.

44:41.043 --> 44:42.211
Here you go, Lawrence.

44:53.422 --> 44:54.757
All right,
enjoy, fellas.

45:04.434 --> 45:07.403
That was the best
barbecue I've ever had.

45:08.304 --> 45:09.405
Seriously.

45:09.438 --> 45:10.773
What's in the sauce?

45:10.806 --> 45:12.742
Old family secret.

45:12.775 --> 45:14.443
You got a lot of
secrets, Durwood.

45:15.478 --> 45:18.315
How do you know so much?

45:18.347 --> 45:19.449
It's just sauce.

45:19.481 --> 45:21.418
No, about everything.

45:21.451 --> 45:25.822
About barbecue, about
obscure taxation laws.

45:25.855 --> 45:27.858
Life.

45:27.891 --> 45:29.358
I've lived a lot of it.

45:29.391 --> 45:30.493
Yeah.

45:30.527 --> 45:32.028
Worn a lot of hats.

45:32.061 --> 45:35.231
I never would have given
you the time of day unless

45:35.264 --> 45:37.400
Miles had insisted.

45:37.432 --> 45:40.771
He's always had a
certain intuition

45:40.804 --> 45:43.106
that I just don't.

45:43.139 --> 45:46.009
Can't teach intuition, can you?

45:46.041 --> 45:47.409
He's a born leader.

45:47.443 --> 45:49.813
Doesn't even know it.

45:49.846 --> 45:53.349
Don't compare your goodness

45:53.382 --> 45:56.352
by the prism of somebody else.

45:56.385 --> 45:59.456
You're doing all right by him.

45:59.489 --> 46:01.925
What do you want out
of all this, Durwood?

46:01.958 --> 46:04.027
I mean, besides the obvious.

46:04.059 --> 46:08.965
One thing I want, is for a
certain smart young individual

46:08.998 --> 46:13.003
to forgo the assumptions
accompanying a man's clothes.

46:13.036 --> 46:15.005
A mistake I've
made once or twice.

46:15.038 --> 46:19.108
Then, well I might die happy.

46:19.141 --> 46:22.278
Which will probably be the
case when Miles gets back.

46:22.311 --> 46:24.914
He's gonna kill us when he
sees we've hired a full staff.

46:45.235 --> 46:47.003
Doesn't it cost a
lot to send these back?

46:47.036 --> 46:49.405
No it's like
pennies on the dollar.

46:49.438 --> 46:51.507
Besides, when these little
piggies are at guard,

46:51.541 --> 46:53.410
it keeps "the powers that be"
from interfering.

46:53.443 --> 46:55.412
So they're like sentinels.

46:55.445 --> 46:56.313
Yeah.

46:56.346 --> 46:58.181
Exactly.

46:58.213 --> 47:00.382
You know, I used to have
one of these when I was a kid.

47:00.416 --> 47:03.119
I filled it with chewing gum
and baseball cards though.

47:03.152 --> 47:05.387
A pretty girl
with baseball cards.

47:05.420 --> 47:07.890
You are so adorable.

47:09.125 --> 47:12.295
Gosh that seems
so far away now.

47:15.030 --> 47:18.367
Why don't we, you
know, go see your folks?

47:18.400 --> 47:21.036
You said they're
close by, right?

47:21.070 --> 47:22.539
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

47:22.572 --> 47:23.874
No? Okay.

47:23.907 --> 47:25.508
Right.

47:25.541 --> 47:26.443
Cool.

47:30.213 --> 47:32.282
We can't stay long though.

47:33.983 --> 47:35.853
Okay.

47:37.320 --> 47:38.455
Let's do it.

47:51.166 --> 47:52.434
It's okay.

47:52.467 --> 47:53.969
Could you
just give me a second?

47:54.003 --> 47:55.672
Okay, no problem.

47:55.704 --> 47:57.539
Okay.

48:25.101 --> 48:28.572
Okay?

48:37.347 --> 48:39.049
You have a
responsibility that you

48:39.081 --> 48:41.250
haven't taken care of!
No, Dad!

48:41.284 --> 48:42.318
You know why I did it!

48:42.351 --> 48:44.119
You know exactly why I did that!

48:44.152 --> 48:46.121
Right, but now it's
time to take care of it!

48:48.992 --> 48:50.593
Don't
you start with that!

48:53.628 --> 48:55.097
You must be Miles.

48:55.130 --> 48:56.298
Mrs. Norris.

48:56.331 --> 48:58.467
Sorry I just let
myself in like that.

48:58.501 --> 48:59.569
Don't be silly.

48:59.601 --> 49:01.570
I've heard so much
about you from

49:01.603 --> 49:03.439
Penelope's post cards.

49:03.472 --> 49:06.543
You know, she doesn't
get to call home

49:06.576 --> 49:08.344
that much anymore.

49:08.378 --> 49:10.113
Would you mind helping
me in the kitchen?

49:10.146 --> 49:11.348
Yeah, I'd love to.

49:11.380 --> 49:12.648
-Okay.
-Yes, yes.

49:18.621 --> 49:20.155
Mom, are you okay?

49:23.592 --> 49:25.728
I understand you're
a business owner.

49:25.762 --> 49:27.130
How exciting.

49:27.163 --> 49:28.630
He doesn't want
to talk about that.

49:28.664 --> 49:32.035
Well, why don't we just let
Miles be the judge of that?

49:33.302 --> 49:34.403
Yes, ma'am, I am.

49:34.436 --> 49:35.337
I...

49:35.371 --> 49:36.271
What kind of business is it?

49:36.304 --> 49:37.272
That's a good question.

49:38.273 --> 49:39.775
He's a collector.

49:39.809 --> 49:41.144
Professional collector.

49:41.177 --> 49:42.512
And he's been nice
enough to give me a job.

49:43.445 --> 49:44.614
I see.

49:44.646 --> 49:48.518
So, antiques or cars, or...

49:48.550 --> 49:50.119
Coins.

49:51.454 --> 49:53.722
Okay!

49:53.755 --> 49:55.290
That's very neat, Miles.

49:56.425 --> 49:57.693
Yeah.

49:57.726 --> 50:01.163
You've raised a
wonderful daughter.

50:03.099 --> 50:05.434
A business owner and a
good judge of character.

50:07.369 --> 50:09.438
We've really grown up with her.

50:09.472 --> 50:10.607
We miss her.

50:12.208 --> 50:14.543
I'm sure you'll
understand some day,

50:14.577 --> 50:16.246
that is if you have children.

50:18.481 --> 50:19.582
Yeah, yeah obviously.

50:19.614 --> 50:20.582
Yes, yeah.

50:20.615 --> 50:23.286
Yeah, kids.

50:30.159 --> 50:32.195
We've just been talking.

50:32.228 --> 50:35.498
Miles here has been kind
enough to give Penelope a job.

50:35.530 --> 50:37.400
Is that so?

50:37.432 --> 50:40.603
What line of work
are you in, Miles?

50:40.635 --> 50:41.771
He collects coins.

50:41.804 --> 50:43.273
Isn't that fascinating?

50:43.306 --> 50:45.541
And you turn profit, do you?

50:45.574 --> 50:47.342
You'd be surprised, sir.

50:47.376 --> 50:49.246
How old are you, Miles?

50:51.614 --> 50:53.349
I'm...

50:53.382 --> 50:55.518
35.

50:55.550 --> 50:57.686
I'm willing to give
the benefit of the doubt

50:57.719 --> 51:00.756
to anyone who's 35
and still says sir.

51:03.492 --> 51:04.626
Who wants dessert?

51:04.659 --> 51:06.328
Yeah.

51:06.362 --> 51:09.331
First, we gotta talk.

51:11.300 --> 51:12.735
Miles, you seem to be
an impressive young man,

51:12.768 --> 51:16.172
I trust you won't be offended
if I ask you to wait outside.

51:16.204 --> 51:18.141
No, he stays.

51:18.173 --> 51:19.608
He can hear whatever
you have to say.

51:19.641 --> 51:20.609
It's okay, it's
okay, really, I...

51:20.643 --> 51:22.244
No.

51:25.614 --> 51:27.083
Very well.

51:28.550 --> 51:31.221
Will you give this
to Penelope, please?

51:32.387 --> 51:34.290
Okay, all right.

51:35.291 --> 51:37.626
Now that's $500.

51:37.659 --> 51:40.562
And I want you to take it,
regardless of what comes next.

51:40.596 --> 51:42.197
Dad, I told you, I have a job.

51:42.231 --> 51:44.267
I have an income now.

51:44.300 --> 51:45.268
I'm gonna set this all straight.

51:45.300 --> 51:47.436
I'm gonna dial this number.

51:47.469 --> 51:50.372
This is a good man, and he
tells me that he's gonna do

51:50.405 --> 51:53.610
everything in his power
to try to help you out.

51:54.744 --> 51:56.512
Stop it.

51:56.545 --> 51:57.846
She's not a criminal.

51:57.880 --> 51:59.782
We've all made mistakes.

52:01.317 --> 52:04.554
Why are you doing this, Dad?

52:04.586 --> 52:06.688
'Cause you have to face this,

52:06.722 --> 52:10.193
so we can get past this
and become a family again.

52:12.195 --> 52:13.496
Again?

52:13.528 --> 52:14.864
I love you with all my heart,

52:14.896 --> 52:16.431
but that's why I
have to do this.

52:16.465 --> 52:18.401
The law is the law, Penelope.

52:18.434 --> 52:20.503
I can't stop you from
walking out that door,

52:20.536 --> 52:24.474
but please, don't disappoint
me anymore, sweetie.

52:26.409 --> 52:29.878
So, would we like to have
banana pudding or shortcake?

52:29.911 --> 52:32.481
You cannot keep
running from consequence.

52:32.514 --> 52:34.516
If you liked the meatloaf,
Miles, I think you would

52:34.550 --> 52:35.785
like the banana pudding.

52:35.818 --> 52:37.487
We shouldn't have come.

52:37.519 --> 52:39.556
Dad, don't do this!

52:40.889 --> 52:42.558
I gotta go, I gotta go.

52:47.362 --> 52:48.263
I love you.

52:48.297 --> 52:51.501
I love you too.

52:51.534 --> 52:52.367
Great meatloaf.

52:52.400 --> 52:54.203
Thank you, Miles.

52:55.503 --> 52:56.739
Goodbye, Penelope.

52:58.541 --> 52:59.776
Okay.

52:59.809 --> 53:01.811
I'll just wiggle on
out of here.

53:06.514 --> 53:07.616
You okay?

53:07.650 --> 53:08.785
Let's go.

53:41.349 --> 53:43.219
Penelope...

53:46.521 --> 53:49.458
I want you know that
you don't ever have to

53:49.492 --> 53:52.394
feel like you have to
talk about that, okay?

53:55.530 --> 53:57.534
I'm in a lot of
trouble, Miles.

53:59.068 --> 54:00.971
Okay?

54:04.806 --> 54:08.277
What kind of trouble
are we talking about?

54:12.614 --> 54:14.549
The money kind.

54:14.583 --> 54:16.786
Where I might have to
go away for a while.

54:18.521 --> 54:19.856
You'd believe me if I
told you I was just trying

54:19.889 --> 54:21.291
to do the right thing, right?

54:21.324 --> 54:22.557
Because I was.
Absolutely.

54:22.590 --> 54:23.759
I know you were trying
to do the right thing.

54:23.793 --> 54:25.394
I know that.

54:25.427 --> 54:26.962
They mean everything to
me and I can't imagine life

54:26.996 --> 54:29.932
without them and when
my mom got sick, I...

54:32.601 --> 54:34.671
I'm trouble.

54:36.405 --> 54:40.477
I bet I'm a lot
more trouble than you.

54:44.380 --> 54:46.516
I'll be there with you
and we will find a way.

54:46.548 --> 54:47.851
Okay?

54:54.690 --> 54:58.628
All right...

55:02.530 --> 55:04.800
You can start by getting
a good night's rest.

55:04.833 --> 55:06.302
Yeah.

55:10.106 --> 55:13.310
It's gonna be okay.

57:08.791 --> 57:09.692
Ellie! It's me.

57:09.724 --> 57:12.761
It's the fella next door.

57:12.795 --> 57:16.465
Last night was great,
it was special.

57:16.498 --> 57:17.966
Especially...

57:18.000 --> 57:19.601
Especially great!

57:19.635 --> 57:22.972
I don't wanna compromise this...

57:23.005 --> 57:24.173
Us.

57:24.206 --> 57:28.544
I know I'm not exactly Johnny
Poetry Pants out here but

57:28.577 --> 57:30.613
I made you somethin'!

57:32.715 --> 57:34.650
I bet you're tired, you know?

57:34.682 --> 57:36.952
'Cause I know I am.

57:36.985 --> 57:39.788
And that's not me braggin'
or nothin', that's just,

57:39.822 --> 57:41.557
you know, it's, can we talk?

57:44.592 --> 57:47.096
Are
you Penelope Norris?

57:47.128 --> 57:48.498
No...

57:48.530 --> 57:50.967
Then
please step aside.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.068
You step aside.

57:53.101 --> 57:55.971
Let me see some
identification, son.

57:56.005 --> 57:58.740
Can you tell me what you do
for a living, Mr. McCray?

57:58.773 --> 57:59.976
Yeah.

58:00.976 --> 58:02.244
What do you do for a living?

58:02.277 --> 58:03.712
I work.

58:04.679 --> 58:06.581
Nothin'.

58:06.614 --> 58:08.049
All right.

58:08.083 --> 58:09.885
Hey, can I ask
what's going on here?

58:09.918 --> 58:11.686
No, you may not.

58:11.719 --> 58:14.689
You gonna tell me where
Penelope's headed?

58:14.722 --> 58:18.594
I have no idea.

58:20.862 --> 58:22.764
Say that again.

58:23.965 --> 58:28.103
I have no idea.

58:32.041 --> 58:33.610
It's your lucky day.

58:34.242 --> 58:35.844
We believe you.

58:37.346 --> 58:39.215
We're done here, Kyle.

58:42.717 --> 58:44.219
Have a nice day.

58:45.721 --> 58:48.623
Hey,
you can't take those soaps.

58:48.657 --> 58:50.026
Evidence.

58:55.731 --> 58:57.967
Tell me the meaning
of life, Durwood.

58:58.000 --> 59:01.003
Now is as good a time as any.

59:01.036 --> 59:03.739
Well I had it years ago, but,

59:03.771 --> 59:06.675
then I left it on the roof
of my car at a gas station

59:06.708 --> 59:09.044
and drove off.

59:09.077 --> 59:11.614
Something she
said stuck with me.

59:11.646 --> 59:15.050
Said we were thieving wishes.

59:15.083 --> 59:16.786
I don't know about that.

59:16.818 --> 59:18.653
Coins are just the vessels.

59:18.686 --> 59:21.623
Let's just make sure we
put them to good use.

59:23.726 --> 59:26.662
So how are you and
Jack getting along?

59:26.695 --> 59:28.597
He's a good manager.

59:28.630 --> 59:30.266
And a good man.

59:31.634 --> 59:33.369
We got ourselves quite an
empire on our hands here,

59:33.402 --> 59:35.304
Durwood.

59:35.336 --> 59:36.338
Hey!

59:36.371 --> 59:38.306
It's a shooting star!

59:38.340 --> 59:40.076
Two sips.

59:40.108 --> 59:41.344
Cheers.

59:41.376 --> 59:43.112
Cheers.

59:47.148 --> 59:48.851
You will find her.

59:52.320 --> 59:55.924
All right well thanks for
yappin' with me, Durwood.

59:55.958 --> 59:59.028
Next time why don't we talk
about your love life, all right?

59:59.061 --> 01:00:00.229
It's only fair.

01:00:00.262 --> 01:00:02.097
Yeah, I'll tell you about the

01:00:02.130 --> 01:00:05.166
12 loves of my life.

01:00:05.199 --> 01:00:07.135
Deal.

01:00:07.168 --> 01:00:11.807
Take care.

01:01:31.753 --> 01:01:32.989
More coffee?

01:01:35.791 --> 01:01:37.794
Thanks, Hans.

01:01:59.481 --> 01:02:01.350
It will be okay.

01:02:06.822 --> 01:02:07.389
Miles.

01:02:07.422 --> 01:02:08.757
What's good, Jack?

01:02:08.791 --> 01:02:10.226
Everything, man, everything.

01:02:10.259 --> 01:02:11.126
How's the road?

01:02:11.159 --> 01:02:12.795
Very nurturing, actually.

01:02:12.827 --> 01:02:14.829
We have officially
farmed the state dry.

01:02:14.862 --> 01:02:16.297
Really?

01:02:16.331 --> 01:02:19.135
Then I guess it's time for you
to come back home then?

01:02:19.168 --> 01:02:20.803
No, Jack. National.

01:02:20.835 --> 01:02:21.836
What?

01:02:21.869 --> 01:02:23.538
What do you mean national?

01:02:23.572 --> 01:02:26.142
If North Carolina is any
indication of what we can do,

01:02:26.175 --> 01:02:28.377
think about the
possibilities here.

01:02:28.409 --> 01:02:30.478
Listen.

01:02:30.512 --> 01:02:35.051
Miles, I gotta
tell you something.

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:42.458
National sounds great.

01:02:42.490 --> 01:02:43.492
It's a good idea.

01:02:43.525 --> 01:02:44.159
All right!

01:02:44.193 --> 01:02:46.496
I knew you'd be on board, man.

01:02:48.396 --> 01:02:49.998
Jack?

01:02:50.032 --> 01:02:51.100
Jack.

01:02:51.132 --> 01:02:52.467
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:52.501 --> 01:02:54.436
I'll make the arrangements.

01:02:54.469 --> 01:02:55.503
I miss you, man.

01:02:55.536 --> 01:02:57.472
National, buddy.

01:02:57.505 --> 01:02:58.840
Yeah.

01:03:05.914 --> 01:03:08.918
Time to get to work.

01:03:40.548 --> 01:03:42.552
Thanks, man.

01:05:08.469 --> 01:05:09.971
Hoods up.

01:05:12.574 --> 01:05:13.474
-Hey!
-Hey!

01:05:13.509 --> 01:05:16.411
It's good to
see you, welcome back.

01:05:16.445 --> 01:05:17.646
Good to see you too.

01:05:17.679 --> 01:05:20.014
The lone prospector returns.

01:05:20.047 --> 01:05:21.182
It's good to see you, Durwood.

01:05:21.215 --> 01:05:22.451
Is that a little
grey I see in there?

01:05:22.483 --> 01:05:24.485
Older and wiser from the road.

01:05:24.518 --> 01:05:25.653
I guess he's all "growed up".

01:05:25.686 --> 01:05:27.389
Why don't we have
those beers?

01:05:27.422 --> 01:05:30.192
We got something
to show you first.

01:05:30.224 --> 01:05:32.327
Told you we had a
surprise for you, right?

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:33.461
You did say that.

01:05:37.132 --> 01:05:38.067
Okay.

01:05:39.166 --> 01:05:41.336
Fearless leader!

01:05:55.483 --> 01:05:57.652
This is where it all begins.

01:05:57.686 --> 01:05:59.321
Donald, Lawrence and Tim,

01:05:59.353 --> 01:06:02.123
some of the finest
in the coin business.

01:06:02.157 --> 01:06:04.593
Error coins and
rarities are their game.

01:06:04.626 --> 01:06:08.597
This is Durwood's
brilliant idea.

01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:12.067
A clipped planchet
Eisenhower can go for $400.

01:06:12.099 --> 01:06:15.770
A raised-rim Indian cent
can maybe fetch $100.

01:06:15.804 --> 01:06:19.008
A double-struck quarter
can go for $1000.

01:06:19.041 --> 01:06:20.309
Then there are the rarities.

01:06:20.342 --> 01:06:21.510
That would be Hans.

01:06:21.543 --> 01:06:24.113
Who is Hans?

01:06:24.146 --> 01:06:26.148
Hello Supreme Leader!

01:06:26.181 --> 01:06:28.483
Please don't do that,
don't do that ever again.

01:06:28.516 --> 01:06:31.019
I am sorry, Supreme Leader.

01:06:31.052 --> 01:06:33.621
I am sorry.
It's okay.

01:06:33.655 --> 01:06:37.559
Hans here is in possession
of some very very rare coins.

01:06:37.592 --> 01:06:39.795
Have you ever heard of a
1913 Liberty Head nickel?

01:06:39.827 --> 01:06:41.130
Nope, never heard of one.

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:42.630
Well, you found one.

01:06:42.664 --> 01:06:44.466
And now Hans has it.

01:06:44.498 --> 01:06:45.666
Priceless.

01:06:45.699 --> 01:06:48.703
What's to prevent Hans here
from just running off with it?

01:06:48.737 --> 01:06:50.305
Never!

01:06:50.338 --> 01:06:53.409
Supreme Leader has
given me everything.

01:06:53.442 --> 01:06:54.476
Everything!

01:06:54.509 --> 01:06:56.512
That, that is dedication.

01:06:56.545 --> 01:06:59.748
Find me that 1849
double eagle, gentlemen.

01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:01.549
-Yes, sir.
-Thank you.

01:07:02.317 --> 01:07:04.452
All unremarkable
coins end up here,

01:07:04.485 --> 01:07:07.155
where 55% of our profit is born.

01:07:07.188 --> 01:07:10.259
I know, it ain't
much to see but,

01:07:10.291 --> 01:07:13.795
it is beautiful hearing all
those dollars rake in, right?

01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:15.597
Now, you're gonna wanna
wear one of these.

01:07:21.135 --> 01:07:22.538
Fearless leader.

01:07:22.570 --> 01:07:24.572
We melt the coins
down to their very essence.

01:07:24.606 --> 01:07:27.209
Pre-1963 dimes and
quarters for pure silver,

01:07:27.242 --> 01:07:29.278
World War II nickels
for copper and silver.

01:07:29.311 --> 01:07:32.780
So I guess this is
where currency comes to die.

01:07:32.813 --> 01:07:35.750
No, to
be reborn, Miles.

01:07:35.784 --> 01:07:38.586
And at three to 6,000%
increase in value.

01:07:38.619 --> 01:07:40.556
I'm pretty
sure it's illegal, Jack.

01:07:40.588 --> 01:07:41.856
No, it's not illegal.

01:07:41.889 --> 01:07:44.460
We Googled it, we Binged
it, we asked Jeeves.

01:07:44.492 --> 01:07:46.594
Who will return to
retrieve their coin?

01:07:46.628 --> 01:07:48.363
Do you think they care
what happens to them?

01:07:48.396 --> 01:07:49.832
Who do you think
we're hurting here?

01:07:49.864 --> 01:07:52.166
It's not illegal.

01:07:52.199 --> 01:07:54.169
It's capitalism.

01:07:57.271 --> 01:08:03.112
Here's to Miles with
the fountains, home again.

01:08:07.581 --> 01:08:09.451
Okay, guys.

01:08:09.483 --> 01:08:11.752
How did this all happen?

01:08:11.786 --> 01:08:13.255
This is a caricature.

01:08:13.288 --> 01:08:14.456
A caricature of what?

01:08:14.489 --> 01:08:17.326
You said you wanted something
unique, something of our own.

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:18.827
I said hire nobody else.

01:08:18.859 --> 01:08:20.895
We agreed to hire nobody else
and you went out and hired

01:08:20.929 --> 01:08:22.564
a freaking army, man.

01:08:22.595 --> 01:08:24.166
-We hired a few guys.
-A few?

01:08:24.198 --> 01:08:26.501
To be fair, you hired
what's her name, Penelope?

01:08:26.533 --> 01:08:28.604
Okay, I needed Penelope out
there to help me just as much

01:08:28.636 --> 01:08:30.805
as you needed Durwood here
and you were fine with it.

01:08:30.837 --> 01:08:34.376
Durwood, did you
agree to all this?

01:08:34.408 --> 01:08:35.743
No.

01:08:35.777 --> 01:08:38.514
I didn't agree to it.

01:08:38.546 --> 01:08:40.481
It was my idea.

01:08:40.515 --> 01:08:43.919
If you're gonna blame
somebody, blame me.

01:08:43.952 --> 01:08:45.453
I see.

01:08:46.488 --> 01:08:48.791
Yeah, great.

01:08:52.327 --> 01:08:53.729
What's up with the
two gold watches?

01:08:53.761 --> 01:08:55.264
Is that really necessary?

01:08:55.296 --> 01:08:56.464
One's west coast time.

01:08:56.497 --> 01:08:58.567
Tim, go get a glass.

01:09:03.438 --> 01:09:04.604
What kind of glass?

01:09:04.639 --> 01:09:05.541
A glass.

01:09:05.573 --> 01:09:06.474
A glass!

01:09:07.509 --> 01:09:08.542
Sheesh!

01:09:08.577 --> 01:09:10.179
I can't lose this job, guys.

01:09:10.212 --> 01:09:12.214
No one can.

01:09:12.247 --> 01:09:13.247
Here's the glass,
here's the glass.

01:09:13.279 --> 01:09:14.416
Thank you, finally!

01:09:14.448 --> 01:09:16.951
What is the real problem
here, are you mad at my watches,

01:09:16.984 --> 01:09:19.252
or is it that this all
happened in your absence?

01:09:19.287 --> 01:09:21.456
That without you, we took
a legitimate opportunity

01:09:21.488 --> 01:09:23.658
and actualized it to
its infinite potential,

01:09:23.692 --> 01:09:24.859
those are you words, Miles!
Yeah yeah!

01:09:24.893 --> 01:09:26.194
Infinite potential,
yes, but we have it

01:09:26.228 --> 01:09:27.395
without all of this, okay?

01:09:27.429 --> 01:09:29.596
This is a freaking bureaucracy
that we were trying to avoid.

01:09:29.631 --> 01:09:30.899
This is all the corporate
stuff that we didn't want...

01:09:30.930 --> 01:09:32.600
What's
not to like here?

01:09:32.634 --> 01:09:33.402
You're turning it
into something else!

01:09:33.435 --> 01:09:35.203
Now it is a weight
on our shoulders!

01:09:35.237 --> 01:09:37.537
It's weight, yeah, it's
weight in our pockets, man.

01:09:40.307 --> 01:09:41.643
I send you the
package, you smash them

01:09:41.676 --> 01:09:43.612
and you put 'em
in the bank, okay?

01:09:43.645 --> 01:09:46.247
You think that you are on
the cusp of being a millionaire

01:09:46.279 --> 01:09:48.884
because of you and your
broom and Penelope,

01:09:48.917 --> 01:09:51.486
we took your idea and we
grew it, we made it bigger,

01:09:51.519 --> 01:09:53.622
we made it better, it's
working, it's a success!

01:09:53.654 --> 01:09:54.822
We were trying to
get out of the cubicle,

01:09:54.855 --> 01:09:56.557
you're taking me right back!

01:09:56.591 --> 01:09:58.293
We made something good, you
wanna knock it down, go ahead,

01:09:58.326 --> 01:10:00.295
fire them, I'm not gonna do it!

01:10:01.997 --> 01:10:03.231
What goes, guys?

01:10:03.965 --> 01:10:06.534
Not now, Hans!

01:10:06.568 --> 01:10:09.637
Our fate hangs by a string.

01:10:11.672 --> 01:10:12.675
Shoot.

01:10:15.676 --> 01:10:16.612
Fearless leader!

01:10:16.645 --> 01:10:19.248
Fearless leader!

01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:21.283
A
Glass for your beer?

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:53.515
My god.

01:10:53.547 --> 01:10:55.617
It's so good to see you.

01:10:58.386 --> 01:11:00.055
Hi.

01:11:00.087 --> 01:11:02.023
Hey.

01:11:02.823 --> 01:11:04.893
God, I really missed you.

01:11:06.694 --> 01:11:09.630
Hey after you left
I ran into those guys

01:11:09.663 --> 01:11:12.667
that were looking for you,
I didn't say anything.

01:11:14.636 --> 01:11:16.505
I

01:11:16.537 --> 01:11:19.040
I made these for you.

01:11:20.608 --> 01:11:21.743
It's okay, they're just...

01:11:21.775 --> 01:11:23.577
They're perfect.

01:11:23.610 --> 01:11:24.613
Will you put them on me?

01:11:24.645 --> 01:11:26.648
Yeah, yeah.

01:11:37.625 --> 01:11:39.661
Let's see.

01:11:39.694 --> 01:11:41.297
You look gorgeous.

01:11:42.430 --> 01:11:43.530
I brought you your sweater.

01:11:43.564 --> 01:11:46.801
I don't care about my sweater,
it's...

01:11:51.139 --> 01:11:53.574
I turned myself in.

01:11:57.578 --> 01:11:59.847
Is that passion fruit?

01:11:59.881 --> 01:12:01.583
It's like a mixed mango.

01:12:05.119 --> 01:12:07.756
I found the note you
left in the fountain.

01:12:09.690 --> 01:12:10.992
I love you too.

01:12:12.127 --> 01:12:13.829
Good.

01:12:13.862 --> 01:12:15.764
I want to make this work.

01:12:15.796 --> 01:12:18.132
I'll wait, okay?

01:12:18.166 --> 01:12:19.601
I have to go.

01:12:19.634 --> 01:12:20.969
Just...

01:12:45.926 --> 01:12:48.630
She's beautiful, Miles.

01:12:48.662 --> 01:12:50.798
That's what was so worth
it, that was your hire?

01:12:53.201 --> 01:12:54.703
All right.

01:12:54.735 --> 01:12:55.636
Call 'em up, Jack.

01:12:55.670 --> 01:12:57.538
You call 'em up, Miles.

01:13:00.507 --> 01:13:02.543
So you wanted to see me?

01:13:02.577 --> 01:13:05.480
Yeah, I know we really
haven't had a chance to get to

01:13:05.512 --> 01:13:07.649
know each other
much, you know, but,

01:13:07.681 --> 01:13:09.617
you seem like a stand-up guy.

01:13:09.650 --> 01:13:11.685
Makes it all the
harder to do this,

01:13:11.719 --> 01:13:13.922
I'm gonna have to

01:13:13.954 --> 01:13:15.957
let you...

01:13:15.989 --> 01:13:17.492
Yeah, just let me flourish.

01:13:17.524 --> 01:13:18.092
I understand.

01:13:18.126 --> 01:13:18.960
I gotta let you go.

01:13:18.993 --> 01:13:19.828
Go where?

01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:20.729
Go get you some coffee?

01:13:20.761 --> 01:13:22.797
Okay, you're...

01:13:22.831 --> 01:13:24.199
Why?

01:13:24.231 --> 01:13:25.801
It's just, things have
gotten a little out of hand.

01:13:25.833 --> 01:13:28.170
We started in crazy. Why
is crazy affecting us now?

01:13:28.203 --> 01:13:30.639
My wife, she's about
to have a little baby.

01:13:30.671 --> 01:13:32.640
I'm supposed to check out
the sonogram this week.

01:13:32.673 --> 01:13:34.542
And I have student
loans coming to my ears.

01:13:34.576 --> 01:13:37.578
You know, to get down here I
bought a $125,000 Winnebago.

01:13:37.612 --> 01:13:40.782
Right here, next months'
projected earnings.

01:13:40.814 --> 01:13:42.049
Sorry, I'm sorry.

01:13:42.082 --> 01:13:43.717
Don't tell me
it's Tim, is it Tim?

01:13:43.751 --> 01:13:44.886
What did Tim say?
What did he say?

01:13:44.918 --> 01:13:47.521
Fire those sketchy guys, you
know who I'm talking about.

01:13:47.555 --> 01:13:52.527
I'd like to extend an
invitation to our annual...

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:54.062
Bake-off?

01:13:55.162 --> 01:13:58.632
An exit strategy, or I'm
gonna burn the place down.

01:13:58.666 --> 01:13:59.701
That's it.

01:13:59.734 --> 01:14:00.902
That's it.

01:14:00.935 --> 01:14:01.903
You know what?
This is bullsh...

01:14:01.935 --> 01:14:02.903
Thank you.

01:14:02.936 --> 01:14:06.841
Thank you.

01:14:25.092 --> 01:14:26.494
It's done.

01:14:28.529 --> 01:14:29.597
You got your way.

01:14:29.631 --> 01:14:31.233
I'm done too, okay?

01:14:31.265 --> 01:14:33.601
Consider me fired as well.

01:14:33.635 --> 01:14:35.570
Listen, Miles,
this is your baby.

01:14:35.603 --> 01:14:38.105
Reset it, you can
rehire those guys.

01:14:38.139 --> 01:14:39.106
Do what you gotta do.

01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:40.242
Let me get this straight.

01:14:40.274 --> 01:14:41.710
You just fired
everybody, now you

01:14:41.743 --> 01:14:43.645
dump it in our laps
and you're gonna bail?

01:14:43.677 --> 01:14:45.012
Jack, I'm not cut
out for this, okay?

01:14:45.046 --> 01:14:46.847
You go out that door,
you know what it means.

01:14:46.881 --> 01:14:49.150
Then we're done.

01:14:49.182 --> 01:14:50.252
We're done done.

01:14:50.284 --> 01:14:52.153
Then we're done done.

01:14:55.789 --> 01:14:57.692
Jack, relax.

01:14:57.725 --> 01:14:58.593
You relax.

01:14:58.626 --> 01:15:00.262
Just calm down.

01:15:03.698 --> 01:15:05.567
I see.

01:15:06.768 --> 01:15:09.203
You're just gonna take
your ball and go home.

01:15:11.605 --> 01:15:15.877
Good luck.

01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:21.983
Way to go, Durwood.

01:15:22.850 --> 01:15:24.185
Me?

01:15:24.217 --> 01:15:26.555
Everything's fallen apart
and it's because of you.

01:15:26.587 --> 01:15:28.923
Look, you can fix
this, this is fixable.

01:15:28.957 --> 01:15:30.825
This all started the
minute we brought you on.

01:15:30.858 --> 01:15:32.594
I told him not to
hire you and he did.

01:15:32.627 --> 01:15:35.297
Swallow your pride, son.

01:15:36.663 --> 01:15:38.666
You're fired.

01:15:38.699 --> 01:15:39.701
You can't fire me.

01:15:39.734 --> 01:15:40.602
I just did.

01:15:40.635 --> 01:15:42.070
You're fired.

01:15:42.103 --> 01:15:42.938
You're fired.

01:15:42.970 --> 01:15:44.138
You're fired!

01:15:45.739 --> 01:15:47.309
I'm gonna go after my
friend and when we get back,

01:15:47.341 --> 01:15:48.509
you should not be here.

01:15:48.542 --> 01:15:52.613
We'll be in touch if a position
becomes open down the line.

01:15:52.646 --> 01:15:55.951
Look, now is not the
time to talk to Miles.

01:15:55.984 --> 01:16:00.355
Calm down, let him calm
down, give it some time.

01:16:00.387 --> 01:16:05.126
Goodbye, Durwood.

01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:15.135
Not now, Hans.

01:16:15.168 --> 01:16:16.671
It's okay.

01:17:58.773 --> 01:18:00.742
How'd you find me, man?

01:18:03.176 --> 01:18:04.945
You like to gamble.

01:18:06.380 --> 01:18:09.251
Once in a blue moon I
like to gamble with you.

01:18:11.485 --> 01:18:12.820
Listen I...

01:18:12.854 --> 01:18:14.255
That got pretty...

01:18:14.287 --> 01:18:16.057
Yeah, I know.

01:18:16.990 --> 01:18:19.394
I was ready, man,
I was on board.

01:18:20.528 --> 01:18:22.764
What did you want
out of all that?

01:18:24.765 --> 01:18:26.500
Jack, if you asked me
that when we first started,

01:18:26.533 --> 01:18:29.336
you know, I would
have said success but,

01:18:31.372 --> 01:18:34.376
all I want is Penelope,

01:18:36.042 --> 01:18:37.878
and my best friend back.

01:18:39.146 --> 01:18:42.117
And I'm sorry
because it really...

01:18:44.252 --> 01:18:45.821
I'm sorry.

01:18:49.390 --> 01:18:53.962
What's next?

01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:15.542
Durwood!

01:20:15.576 --> 01:20:17.011
Durwood!

01:20:19.447 --> 01:20:21.949
Durwood? Come on, man!

01:20:21.983 --> 01:20:25.485
Hey look, I'm sorry about
the way we handled that, man.

01:20:25.519 --> 01:20:27.588
We were out of line and,

01:20:27.622 --> 01:20:29.990
it's just plain
wrong, all right?

01:20:30.024 --> 01:20:31.526
Where you at?

01:20:35.195 --> 01:20:36.597
His stuff's still back there.

01:20:36.631 --> 01:20:42.003
And I got like 10 voicemails.

01:20:46.172 --> 01:20:50.010
Are you here to see Durwood?

01:20:54.247 --> 01:20:55.884
Are you two on the list?

01:20:55.917 --> 01:20:57.418
We can be.

01:20:57.451 --> 01:20:58.453
What are your names?

01:20:58.485 --> 01:21:00.354
-Miles.
-Jack.

01:21:02.023 --> 01:21:04.626
He's asked to see
the two of you last.

01:21:05.592 --> 01:21:07.095
Okay.

01:21:07.127 --> 01:21:08.128
Thanks.

01:21:19.539 --> 01:21:21.542
He's ready for you.

01:21:34.121 --> 01:21:36.423
Miles with the fountains.

01:21:46.466 --> 01:21:48.235
What happened?

01:21:50.104 --> 01:21:51.573
The inevitable.

01:21:55.109 --> 01:22:01.682
I I got you something.

01:22:06.220 --> 01:22:09.324
You know, sometimes I

01:22:09.356 --> 01:22:11.626
wonder what kind of
old man I'll make,

01:22:11.658 --> 01:22:14.429
and I sure as hell hope I'm
as cool as you, Durwood.

01:22:14.462 --> 01:22:15.697
I really do.

01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:20.301
Strange thing to think.

01:22:24.537 --> 01:22:29.510
I wanna tell you something.

01:22:34.047 --> 01:22:35.617
What do you need?

01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:41.756
You gave me this.

01:22:41.788 --> 01:22:43.324
Yeah.

01:22:44.457 --> 01:22:46.360
This is good.

01:22:50.430 --> 01:22:52.266
This.

01:22:54.034 --> 01:22:55.569
Better.

01:23:02.143 --> 01:23:03.277
You all right?

01:23:03.310 --> 01:23:05.146
Durwood, are you okay?

01:23:09.350 --> 01:23:11.252
This doesn't feel real.

01:23:12.252 --> 01:23:13.487
That's the way it is.

01:23:14.555 --> 01:23:15.690
What'd you say?

01:23:15.722 --> 01:23:17.524
What's that?

01:23:17.557 --> 01:23:20.494
That's the way it is.

01:23:21.561 --> 01:23:23.497
It's the way it is.

01:23:24.564 --> 01:23:27.101
Well we'll see
you tomorrow, right?

01:23:29.837 --> 01:23:31.139
Tomorrow.

01:23:31.171 --> 01:23:33.007
Good. Yeah.

01:23:47.654 --> 01:23:49.090
Good morning, gentlemen.

01:23:49.122 --> 01:23:50.424
Morning.

01:23:50.457 --> 01:23:51.259
I'm Jack.

01:23:51.292 --> 01:23:52.660
Eli.

01:23:52.693 --> 01:23:53.594
-Miles.
-Miles.

01:23:53.627 --> 01:23:54.629
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

01:23:54.662 --> 01:23:55.697
Nice to meet you too.

01:23:57.864 --> 01:24:01.301
Before we start, we just
wanted to make it clear that

01:24:01.335 --> 01:24:03.237
we intend on
covering everything.

01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:05.440
Spare no expenses,
he was the best.

01:24:05.472 --> 01:24:08.576
Well I appreciate the
gesture, it's very noble

01:24:08.609 --> 01:24:10.445
but it's all taken care of.

01:24:10.478 --> 01:24:12.579
I don't understand.

01:24:13.581 --> 01:24:15.516
I'll leave that to
somebody better equipped.

01:24:15.548 --> 01:24:17.652
Come on in!

01:24:22.323 --> 01:24:23.591
Hi, gentlemen.

01:24:24.692 --> 01:24:27.161
Surely this will be
a lot to take in,

01:24:27.194 --> 01:24:29.564
but I wanted you
to hear it from me.

01:24:29.596 --> 01:24:32.833
I'm Durwood's daughter.

01:24:37.537 --> 01:24:38.705
Thank you.

01:24:41.442 --> 01:24:43.310
You must be Miles.

01:24:43.344 --> 01:24:44.744
Yes.

01:24:44.778 --> 01:24:46.681
And you're Jack.

01:24:46.713 --> 01:24:47.515
Yeah.

01:24:47.547 --> 01:24:48.282
Good to meet you.

01:24:48.315 --> 01:24:50.885
I've heard a lot
about you both.

01:24:50.917 --> 01:24:54.554
My father was many things.

01:24:54.587 --> 01:24:57.190
Most notably a man of

01:24:57.224 --> 01:24:58.860
celebration.

01:24:58.893 --> 01:25:02.462
But he wasn't exactly
the man that you

01:25:02.496 --> 01:25:04.399
thought he was.

01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:10.238
What I'm trying to say is,

01:25:11.204 --> 01:25:15.542
my father was a
self-made billionaire.

01:25:25.653 --> 01:25:28.222
He had many enterprises.

01:25:28.255 --> 01:25:30.625
In a younger life he
was a war veteran,

01:25:30.658 --> 01:25:33.595
a surgeon, and always
a man of his word.

01:25:37.698 --> 01:25:42.503
But, Bone Doctor's Sauce

01:25:42.536 --> 01:25:44.873
was his life's passion.

01:25:49.210 --> 01:25:50.377
Old family secret.

01:25:50.411 --> 01:25:52.712
His diagnosis gave
him very little time,

01:25:52.746 --> 01:25:55.650
so he dedicated himself
to one final act.

01:25:55.682 --> 01:25:59.252
He returned to a station
in life he once knew,

01:25:59.286 --> 01:26:01.756
under the guise
of utter poverty.

01:26:01.788 --> 01:26:05.792
He wanted to prove the good
in people on his own terms.

01:26:07.394 --> 01:26:09.630
Apparently,

01:26:09.662 --> 01:26:12.599
you two,

01:26:12.632 --> 01:26:15.235
balanced the scales.

01:26:17.304 --> 01:26:19.606
I can see why it
was worth it to him.

01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:22.577
Gentlemen,

01:26:22.609 --> 01:26:26.980
Mr. Hamilton's last will
and testament grants you

01:26:27.014 --> 01:26:29.650
limited power of his estate

01:26:29.682 --> 01:26:33.688
to decide which charities will
receive 90% of his wealth,

01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:37.390
and the rest will be allocated
amongst his 12 grandchildren.

01:26:37.423 --> 01:26:41.362
And along with requesting your
compliance as pallbearers,

01:26:41.395 --> 01:26:44.999
he's asked me to
read you these words.

01:26:45.032 --> 01:26:46.801
"Start again."

01:27:12.458 --> 01:27:14.561
The world
is still here.

01:27:16.630 --> 01:27:19.467
But a shade less
bright without you.

01:27:22.770 --> 01:27:26.040
I think you'll find your troubles
have a way of growing up

01:27:26.073 --> 01:27:27.942
and leaving home.

01:27:30.344 --> 01:27:33.346
Not through the door,
not out the window,

01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:35.917
but gone none the less.

01:27:39.552 --> 01:27:42.523
May your family have bread so
that they never know hunger,

01:27:42.555 --> 01:27:45.525
and salt so life
always has flavor.

01:27:59.972 --> 01:28:01.942
We will
always deal in coin

01:28:01.975 --> 01:28:04.345
with the understanding
that its purpose springs

01:28:04.377 --> 01:28:06.680
only from the hand beneath it.

01:28:25.599 --> 01:28:27.935
For now,

01:28:27.967 --> 01:28:30.037
we just live.

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:30.798
They say youth
is wasted on the young,

01:29:30.831 --> 01:29:34.668
but in three months, you
and I will prove otherwise.

01:29:37.438 --> 01:29:39.539
Sending you well wishes.
