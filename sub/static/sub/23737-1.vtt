00:32.833 --> 00:34.102
Aah!

00:37.605 --> 00:38.772
Aah!

00:42.910 --> 00:44.145
Aah!

00:49.383 --> 00:50.318
Aah!

00:54.422 --> 00:55.356
Aah!

01:01.429 --> 01:02.496
Aah!

01:20.948 --> 01:21.915
Right here.

01:24.017 --> 01:25.253
That's good.

01:36.497 --> 01:38.932
- Twenty-four.

01:38.966 --> 01:40.201
Twenty

01:40.234 --> 01:42.403
Oh, I wish
I was 24 again.

01:44.004 --> 01:46.174
How old were you
when you got started?

01:46.207 --> 01:48.809
When I started? 24.

01:48.842 --> 01:50.311
That's when
I first started.

01:52.613 --> 01:53.914
How about now?

01:55.783 --> 01:57.151
Now, I'm 39.

01:58.352 --> 01:59.787
And it's almost
my birthday.

02:27.047 --> 02:28.582
I get
the happy birthday.

02:28.616 --> 02:29.983
- I get
the happy birthday!

02:30.017 --> 02:31.619
I hope this one's meh.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.523
Don't be weird.

02:35.556 --> 02:36.890
Oh, my God. Stop it.

02:36.924 --> 02:39.293
Mia, let's go sing
"Happy Birthday" to you.

02:41.061 --> 02:43.931
* Happy birthday
to you *

02:43.964 --> 02:45.566
Say, "I'm the man."

02:45.599 --> 02:47.268
Do it!
Say, "I'm the man."

02:47.301 --> 02:48.602
Now, look
who the man is.

02:50.738 --> 02:52.206
This guy!

02:53.974 --> 02:56.109
No, do one! Come on!

02:56.143 --> 02:57.478
Make mommy
do one, yeah.

02:57.511 --> 02:58.779
- You made me do it.
- Mommy, come on.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.084
You're the man, Joe.
You're the man.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.022
When you..
Kira, Callie, go back.

03:09.056 --> 03:10.924
I don't wanna
do this song.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.793
- You're in!
- You're in!

03:12.826 --> 03:15.696
- Go back.
- I'm the only person
who's doing this.

03:15.729 --> 03:16.764
You're stupid.

03:19.099 --> 03:21.101
- Stop.
- I can't even do this.

03:23.604 --> 03:27.341
Oh, my gosh. You're going
to make me cry.

03:27.375 --> 03:30.177
Look at Mia!
She's, like, grabbing it.

03:30.210 --> 03:33.113
She's not spanking it.
She's grabbing it.

03:35.983 --> 03:38.286
Love you.
Jammies on, get to bed.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.689
Sleepy time. Sleepy --

03:41.722 --> 03:43.757
- Time for bed.
- Sleepy time.

03:43.791 --> 03:46.827
Daddy, I wanna watch
the video.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.562
You can watch
again later.

03:48.596 --> 03:49.830
Tomorrow?

03:49.863 --> 03:51.732
Okay, baby, it's
almost nine o'clock.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.467
Okay? Goodnight.

03:56.003 --> 03:58.572
- I said, "Dad."
- Go into your tomb.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.274
Daddy.

04:00.308 --> 04:01.975
Goodnight, mommy.
Goodnight, daddy.

04:02.009 --> 04:03.277
Jax, get back!

04:03.311 --> 04:04.412
Need to sit down?

04:07.981 --> 04:09.383
Meds working?

04:09.417 --> 04:10.684
Do they ever work?

04:15.122 --> 04:16.890
I'm gonna go out
for a run.

04:46.987 --> 04:48.021
...last round.

04:51.559 --> 04:52.793
What's he gonna
do to you?

04:52.826 --> 04:54.127
- Nothin'.
- Exactly.

04:54.161 --> 04:55.896
- Is he gonna be
bigger than Joe?
- No.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.365
- Is he gonna be
stronger than Joe?
- No.

04:57.398 --> 05:00.200
- Okay, and you were
taking Joe down at will.
- Yes.

05:00.233 --> 05:01.234
- Yes.

05:01.268 --> 05:02.503
You broke
his goddamn finger.

05:02.536 --> 05:03.571
- You took him down.
- Yes.

05:03.604 --> 05:05.005
Okay, there's
no way this man

05:05.038 --> 05:06.474
is gonna be as strong
and as big as that man.

05:06.507 --> 05:07.608
- No.
- You were doing
it to him.

05:07.641 --> 05:08.876
- He couldn't stop you.
Okay?
- Yes.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.110
You gotta put
your mind to it.
- Yes.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.479
- And you gotta do it.
- Yes.

05:11.512 --> 05:12.913
And you gotta
keep doing it.
- Yes.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.114
And doin' it, and doin' it
and doin' it

05:14.147 --> 05:15.148
until it gets done.

05:28.529 --> 05:29.930
Kill that motherfucker.

05:35.669 --> 05:38.171
Joe, come on, man,
get your head
in the game.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.859
Take his ass down!

05:58.892 --> 06:00.628
Turn, Joe!

06:00.661 --> 06:02.229
Pull guard! Joe, go!

06:10.938 --> 06:12.305
Joe, get up!

06:19.513 --> 06:22.483
There you go.
Pull guard, Joe!

06:22.516 --> 06:24.051
Pull guard, Joe!

06:25.919 --> 06:27.020
Punch!

06:27.054 --> 06:28.088
Punch!

07:28.782 --> 07:31.619
Heh-heh!
Happy birthday, Joe.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.821
- That was for Joe.
- Joe, the old man.

07:36.089 --> 07:37.457
Break time!

07:37.491 --> 07:39.493
Break time, fun time
for you, Joe.

07:39.527 --> 07:41.194
So, who are you
fightin', Joe?

07:41.995 --> 07:43.664
Clayton Hoy.

07:43.697 --> 07:46.233
Conan the Barbarian!

07:48.936 --> 07:51.705
- He looks like
a Greek God.
- The guy is fit.

07:51.739 --> 07:53.406
- Look how big he is!
- That's -- that's Conan.

07:53.440 --> 07:56.076
- I know.
- Man, that dude
is legit!

07:56.109 --> 07:57.611
Yeah.

07:57.645 --> 07:59.747
So, you have to lose
25 pounds?

07:59.780 --> 08:01.749
You need to shave
that fucking beard

08:01.782 --> 08:04.785
because that's gotta be
a pound, at least.

08:04.818 --> 08:07.788
- Take a lot of shits.
- He is
in really good shape.

08:39.286 --> 08:41.755
Hi, mom.
Hey, dad.

08:41.789 --> 08:44.091
- So, you forgot
to decorate for my party.
- Yeah.

08:44.124 --> 08:45.425
Want me
to blow up balloons?

08:45.458 --> 08:47.995
Sure. You can
put those up.

08:50.764 --> 08:52.232
- It doesn't stretch
far enough.

08:52.265 --> 08:53.967
I'll get
a piece of string.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.771
You don't seem
to be your happy,
jovial self, Joe.

08:57.805 --> 08:59.039
- Yeah.

08:59.072 --> 09:01.441
- I'm tired.

09:01.474 --> 09:03.143
- Yeah.

09:05.345 --> 09:07.280
[speaking in
foreign language]

09:08.782 --> 09:10.918
- Whipped cream!
- Oh!

09:10.951 --> 09:12.886
- Shh.
- Put it in my mouth!
My mouth!

09:12.920 --> 09:13.921
No. No.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.633
- I'm third.
- Second.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.935
- You got to go
upside down.
- Stop.

09:27.968 --> 09:29.970
- Stop.
- Last.

09:30.003 --> 09:30.938
Can I do one?

09:35.709 --> 09:37.711
Oh, my God.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.650
Jonah, Jonah, Jonah,
Jonah, Jonah.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.685
Stay over there.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.586
And don't move
from that couch!

09:46.620 --> 09:47.788
I'm not joking.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.156
Sit down over there
with him.

09:49.189 --> 09:50.290
Get over there
with him now!

09:50.323 --> 09:51.892
Oh, there goes dad.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.694
Tired of you two
little idiots.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.729
Sit right there
and don't move.

09:55.763 --> 09:57.497
Who called?

09:57.530 --> 09:59.299
What the hell
is the matter
with you two?

09:59.332 --> 10:01.068
Watching you
like a bunch of retards

10:01.101 --> 10:03.036
running around
the house.

10:03.070 --> 10:04.237
You think it's funny?

10:04.271 --> 10:06.539
- Hey, Mike,
remember those days?
- Daddy.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.976
Sit down!

10:09.009 --> 10:11.078
Michael, I guess
you're like..

10:11.111 --> 10:13.280
...if I have to get up.

10:14.581 --> 10:16.349
What is it?

10:16.383 --> 10:19.086
The whipped cream!
Aah!

10:19.119 --> 10:21.188
- The P word.
- Grandpa.

10:21.221 --> 10:22.956
- Ah-ha-ha.

10:28.428 --> 10:29.396
Huh!

10:30.764 --> 10:31.832
Huh!

10:32.632 --> 10:33.667
Huh!

10:33.701 --> 10:34.768
Come on, Joe.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.439
Come on, old man!

10:41.809 --> 10:43.043
Clayton's waiting!

10:55.989 --> 10:57.457
- Joe!

10:57.490 --> 10:58.525
Are you going
to have some?

10:58.558 --> 11:00.027
I'll have some later,
I'm gonna get --

11:00.060 --> 11:01.695
I have to cook them
all up first.

11:04.698 --> 11:07.434
- I'm first.
- It's not a competition,
girls.

11:07.467 --> 11:10.637
- It's really
a competition?
- Yeah, yes.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.306
- Remember last time,
Kira? I won.
- Okay, sit down, please.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.008
- I'll win again.
- Stop it!

11:15.042 --> 11:16.676
- Hey, Callie!
- Stop!

11:16.710 --> 11:17.978
I -- I'm not
doing anything, look.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.180
- Look, I'm not fighting.
- She's ten!

11:20.213 --> 11:22.615
Don't aggravate her.

11:22.649 --> 11:24.918
- Callie. No.
- Shake hands.

11:24.952 --> 11:27.888
Shake hands.
Shake hands.

11:27.921 --> 11:30.223
Stop. Stop!
It's -- get off!

11:30.257 --> 11:32.726
- Get off!
- Aah! No pulling.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.895
- Callie!
- I'm fine, Delanee!

11:34.928 --> 11:37.364
- She's all mean.
- Oh, mommy!

11:37.397 --> 11:38.732
- Okay, girls.

11:38.766 --> 11:40.400
You guys get
your own corners.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.302
- You guys go
get ready for --
- I call this corner!

11:42.335 --> 11:44.471
- Oh, boy.
- Of course.

11:44.504 --> 11:47.507
- You smacked him.
- No, no, no, no.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.843
- Did too.
- Ha-ha-ha.

12:21.608 --> 12:24.044
- So, what's
your weight now?
- I haven't checked.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.779
- Okay.
- I have a lot
of clothes on now.

12:25.813 --> 12:27.447
I'm just gonna
keep going for,
like, a couple hours

12:27.480 --> 12:28.548
and see where I'm at.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.250
Well, we don't have
a couple of hours.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.419
So..

12:32.452 --> 12:34.187
- Let's go. We gotta --
- I'm going.

12:34.221 --> 12:35.655
Okay, we gotta
pick it up, brother.

12:35.688 --> 12:38.458
I can't go --
I don't wanna
run any faster.

12:38.491 --> 12:40.060
- Okay.
- That just builds
endurance.

12:40.093 --> 12:43.196
- I'm trying
to lose weight, so..
- Okay, well.

12:43.230 --> 12:45.866
We should've been losing
weight three weeks ago.
Like I asked.

12:45.899 --> 12:48.401
You know what, you don't
have to do this at all,
man, don't worry.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.003
- If you don't want
to do it, it's okay.
- Joe, Joe.

12:50.037 --> 12:51.571
It's okay, alright,
If you don't,
if -- I'm sayin'

12:51.604 --> 12:53.473
if you don't
want to do it,
it's no big deal..

12:53.506 --> 12:55.275
I'm serious, if you --
if you, like, could..

12:55.308 --> 12:58.011
- I'm tryin' to deal with
a lot of stuff right now.
- I understand all that.

12:58.045 --> 13:00.113
And this week
was supposed to be
set to lose weight.

13:00.147 --> 13:02.149
But a lot of stuff
came up, and like I said

13:02.182 --> 13:04.584
if, if it's --
if it's, if it's
embarrassing to you --

13:04.617 --> 13:07.354
It's not embarrassing,
it's not, no,
it's not that.

13:07.387 --> 13:09.089
- It's my fault.
- Okay, yeah.

13:09.122 --> 13:13.060
But...if we
would've done this when
I asked you to do it..

13:13.093 --> 13:14.594
I work in a boiler room
all day long.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.729
I gotta drink water.

13:16.763 --> 13:19.299
- I gotta eat.
- Okay, man.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.001
Just get on
the treadmill,
we gotta go.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.178
What's the matter?

13:42.455 --> 13:44.457
Oh, well,
if you get sick

13:44.491 --> 13:46.126
there's less weight
for you to cut.

13:57.537 --> 13:58.838
You want to know
what separates us

13:58.872 --> 14:00.640
from normal people, Joe?

14:00.673 --> 14:02.976
This, right here.

14:03.010 --> 14:06.113
This is what separates us
from normal people.

14:06.146 --> 14:08.381
Normal people are
on their couch right now

14:08.415 --> 14:09.816
watching "South Park."

14:13.620 --> 14:15.822
That's what separates us
from normal people.

14:21.794 --> 14:24.397
One fifty-five
point two.

14:24.431 --> 14:25.432
What are you
weighing?

14:25.465 --> 14:27.834
219. I gotta
weigh 210.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.673
Perfect.
How about here?

14:33.706 --> 14:36.109
Quick roll call, Rob Dyer
is probably not here.

14:36.143 --> 14:37.477
Derrick Brody?

14:37.510 --> 14:38.511
- Here.

14:38.545 --> 14:39.646
Clayton?

14:39.679 --> 14:41.414
I will be posting
the line-up tonight

14:41.448 --> 14:43.550
on our Facebook page,
if you wanna know
where you're fighting.

14:43.583 --> 14:46.119
Um, depending on
who makes weight
and who doesn't..

14:46.153 --> 14:48.721
184.5.

14:48.755 --> 14:50.223
155.

14:50.257 --> 14:52.159
178.

14:52.192 --> 14:53.626
Joe Carman.

14:53.660 --> 14:57.197
204.5.
You're in.

15:09.142 --> 15:13.013
It's show time, bro.
Let's get this done.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.082
Show this kid
who's still the champ.

15:27.027 --> 15:29.262
Alright, ladies
and gentlemen

15:29.296 --> 15:31.798
fighting under
the United FC
Fighting Team

15:31.831 --> 15:33.533
Joe Carman!

15:35.268 --> 15:36.703
And at the red corner

15:36.736 --> 15:39.439
fighting out of
Bellingham MMA

15:39.472 --> 15:41.408
Clayton Hoy!

15:46.046 --> 15:46.980
Fight!

15:59.459 --> 16:01.428
- Come on, Joe!
- Cage him up!

16:03.496 --> 16:05.632
Bring him in, Joe.
Bring him in.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.267
Oh, bring it to him!

16:12.672 --> 16:15.242
Go left. Set it up.
Set it up.

16:22.415 --> 16:23.850
Once again,
let's put it together

16:23.883 --> 16:26.353
for the spectacular
Sierra!

16:32.192 --> 16:33.826
I'm having a hard time
breathing, sorry.

16:33.860 --> 16:35.895
Let's get ready
for round two, everybody.

16:35.928 --> 16:37.497
What do you say?

16:38.698 --> 16:40.500
Let's go, Joe.
You gotta take him.

16:40.533 --> 16:41.668
Take down, Joe.
Take..

16:43.070 --> 16:44.537
Take it down. Right.

16:44.571 --> 16:46.739
Go left!
Set it up. Set it up.

16:51.311 --> 16:52.312
Shit!

16:58.485 --> 16:59.819
It appears
as though we have

16:59.852 --> 17:02.222
an inadvertent
low blow.

17:02.255 --> 17:05.558
Protective gear
only goes so far.

17:05.592 --> 17:08.061
The fighter gets
five minutes to recover

17:08.095 --> 17:10.029
up to five minutes
to recover.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.042
Bring it, Joe.

17:23.076 --> 17:26.846
Joe, Joe, Joe,
Joe, Joe, Joe!

17:31.551 --> 17:33.486
He's on his feet!

18:06.586 --> 18:07.587
Stop!

18:11.858 --> 18:14.127
Big round of applause,
ladies and gentlemen.

18:14.161 --> 18:16.095
Great fight.
Great fight.

18:16.129 --> 18:17.497
We have our winner

18:17.530 --> 18:20.533
at 48 seconds
of round number two.

18:20.567 --> 18:22.735
The arm triangle choke

18:22.769 --> 18:24.537
out of the red corner

18:24.571 --> 18:26.739
Clayton Hoy!

18:35.215 --> 18:37.417
* I make statues bleed
and portraits cry *

18:37.450 --> 18:38.651
* I'll go to war
for mine *

18:38.685 --> 18:40.153
* Rebel army
guard the border *

18:40.187 --> 18:41.821
* I'm in the trenches
barkin' orders *

18:41.854 --> 18:42.955
* Like I'm
Sergeant Slaughter *

18:42.989 --> 18:44.257
* Pray to Jesus H

18:44.291 --> 18:45.625
* For mercy
and plead your case *

18:45.658 --> 18:47.059
* 'Cause on the front
lines you're dead *

18:47.093 --> 18:48.728
* The second that you see
my face **

19:16.155 --> 19:18.090
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:18.124 --> 19:19.492
Got a scratch, huh?

19:19.526 --> 19:22.229
Just a little one.

19:22.262 --> 19:24.297
That's not a little
scratch, daddy.

19:24.331 --> 19:25.832
- It's a little scratch.
- No, it isn't.

19:25.865 --> 19:28.067
Um, got, uh..

19:29.302 --> 19:30.670
What is that, a cut?

19:30.703 --> 19:32.239
- Yeah. A little cut.
- That's a good cut.

19:32.272 --> 19:33.340
It's a little one.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.752
What happened
to you promising

19:45.785 --> 19:46.953
you wouldn't
do this again?

19:46.986 --> 19:48.054
And I didn't
even find out

19:48.087 --> 19:49.589
that you were
doing it again.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.090
I understand.

19:51.123 --> 19:52.592
You don't understand.

19:52.625 --> 19:54.661
I'm talking about
promises made, Joe.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.630
- Can we talk about --
- Promises,
promises made.

19:57.664 --> 19:59.566
Did you not offer
that promise?

20:01.534 --> 20:03.836
I, and -- and what
I'm asking for

20:03.870 --> 20:05.004
is like, just, like,
you know, all this--

20:05.037 --> 20:06.205
You're always asking
for something.

20:06.239 --> 20:08.040
Another chance?

20:08.074 --> 20:09.642
Another promise?

20:09.676 --> 20:11.478
- No, I'm just saying--
- You don't keep 'em.

20:12.745 --> 20:14.381
But I have
to stay, right?

20:14.414 --> 20:16.316
Because I'm sick, and I
have nowhere else to go.

20:16.349 --> 20:17.950
So I gotta put up
with whatever

20:17.984 --> 20:20.052
you want to do
and be okay with it.

20:20.086 --> 20:21.854
No, I'm not
saying that, Nori.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.124
I don't understand.

20:25.157 --> 20:26.859
Why do you keep
wanting to fight?

20:26.893 --> 20:29.161
I'm making, like, uh --
uh, I said, about,
I -- I'm making --

20:29.195 --> 20:30.697
You don't even make money
off of this.

20:32.131 --> 20:33.733
You don't make money
off of it.

20:35.201 --> 20:36.703
You trying to prove
something to your dad?

20:36.736 --> 20:38.204
No, I just..

20:38.237 --> 20:40.239
What is it, then?

20:40.273 --> 20:42.442
You know when people
say that, like, you know,
when -- when you have

20:42.475 --> 20:44.477
like,
self

20:44.511 --> 20:46.045
It's something
to prove to myself

20:46.078 --> 20:48.548
because it's
the only time that

20:48.581 --> 20:51.551
in my life when I,
when I feel

20:51.584 --> 20:53.085
proud of myself.

20:53.119 --> 20:55.322
I feel,
I'm proud of you guys.

20:55.355 --> 20:56.956
You know, I'm proud
that I created you guys.

20:56.989 --> 20:58.491
You know, I mean,
I'm proud of my family.

20:58.525 --> 20:59.692
Of you guys.

20:59.726 --> 21:01.694
But the only time I feel,
like, a confidence

21:01.728 --> 21:03.430
in myself
is when I'm fighting.

21:03.463 --> 21:05.998
It's the only time
that I have that sense

21:06.032 --> 21:08.134
that, you know, that..

21:10.102 --> 21:11.838
...that I like me.

21:15.708 --> 21:17.176
It's okay.

21:21.581 --> 21:23.683
I don't want you to be

21:23.716 --> 21:25.918
like...45

21:25.952 --> 21:29.522
and be in a wheelchair
because of an accident

21:29.556 --> 21:32.525
or lose your job
because of fighting.

21:33.593 --> 21:35.194
And you can't work.

21:36.429 --> 21:38.064
I don't want to
give it up

21:38.097 --> 21:39.532
but I'm going
to give it up.

21:39.566 --> 21:40.933
I have to give it up,
because it's --

21:40.967 --> 21:43.336
- But you're not.
- I'm going to.

21:43.370 --> 21:46.706
You just did a fight,
and you got hurt.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.140
You said..

21:48.174 --> 21:50.843
You said if you got hurt,
you would quit.

21:50.877 --> 21:53.145
I got a black eye.
It's not hurt.

21:53.179 --> 21:55.982
It is. It could have
been something worse.

21:56.015 --> 21:58.818
What if I make you
a promise right now,
that I'll..

21:58.851 --> 22:00.286
I'm going to stop
for you guys.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.422
- I'm going to stop
for the family.

22:02.455 --> 22:04.791
You usually don't
keep your promises.

22:38.991 --> 22:44.230
* I've been
working see *

23:01.648 --> 23:05.818
* I've been
working see *

23:24.203 --> 23:28.708
* I've been
working see *

23:33.179 --> 23:37.416
* I I've been working

23:40.587 --> 23:46.125
* I've been
working see *

23:46.158 --> 23:48.695
* Listen see *

24:19.225 --> 24:21.694
Could my dad come?
'Cause he comes
to all my appointments.

24:21.728 --> 24:23.630
Of course. As long as
you're fine with it.

24:23.663 --> 24:25.765
No, yeah,
because I forget things

24:25.798 --> 24:27.834
and he'll remember things
I forget, so..

24:30.603 --> 24:32.505
So, things started

24:32.539 --> 24:35.074
really going downhill
about two years ago.

24:35.107 --> 24:36.475
Yeah, I had, like

24:36.509 --> 24:38.210
a lung infection
that was..

24:38.244 --> 24:40.379
And a chronic cough,
and flu

24:40.412 --> 24:42.048
and they thought
I had shingles

24:42.081 --> 24:44.884
because, like,
my whole body
just was on fire

24:44.917 --> 24:47.319
you know, my skin
and everything.

24:47.353 --> 24:50.356
Yeah, the memory stuff
started, like,
two years ago, too, so.

24:50.389 --> 24:52.759
But it's been getting
progressively worse

24:52.792 --> 24:54.527
the last two years.

24:54.561 --> 24:56.996
I seem
to stump everyone.

24:57.029 --> 24:58.531
Everyone is like,
"I don't know
what's wrong with you.

24:58.565 --> 25:00.533
Something is wrong
with you, we just
don't know what."

25:07.473 --> 25:08.541
You alright?

25:10.376 --> 25:12.845
- It's, you know, I get
those sharp pains.

25:12.879 --> 25:13.846
It's just..

25:15.548 --> 25:17.717
My whole right side
of my body, I told you

25:17.750 --> 25:19.986
it's just been
stupid lately.

25:24.290 --> 25:25.925
Oh, my God.

25:33.399 --> 25:34.500
- I mean, I, I get it.
- You saw it.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.335
It's clear that he threw
everything he had.

25:36.368 --> 25:37.536
And everybody's,
like, going, "Oh!

25:37.570 --> 25:39.105
When he hit you
in the gut, you stopped."

25:39.138 --> 25:40.707
I go, "What are you
talkin' about?

25:40.740 --> 25:42.174
I came right at him
after he hit me."

25:42.208 --> 25:45.011
I never stopped
going forward
the entire time.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.679
- Either I moved
or moved forward.
- Right.

25:46.713 --> 25:48.214
Until he hit me in
the crotch, then,
and I was like

25:48.247 --> 25:50.082
going, this is
really tender right now.

25:50.116 --> 25:51.651
I don't want no one
to come near me.

25:51.684 --> 25:52.852
I remember looking
at the cage

25:52.885 --> 25:54.253
and looking out through
the holes at people

25:54.286 --> 25:56.022
and they're, like,
going, "Ooh."

25:56.055 --> 25:57.123
Yeah.

25:59.358 --> 26:01.493
And then, not even

26:01.527 --> 26:03.162
like, probably
15 minutes later

26:03.195 --> 26:05.998
he posts a picture,
like, saying,
"Total domination."

26:06.032 --> 26:07.634
What the fuck fight
were you fighting

26:07.667 --> 26:09.368
that you think
you totally dominated me?

26:09.401 --> 26:11.137
It's like he thinks
he's this,
I'm, like, going

26:11.170 --> 26:13.405
"You're a fucking
amateur fighter.

26:13.439 --> 26:15.541
You're shit.
You're nothing."

26:37.129 --> 26:40.232
So, I'm working on
a, a rematch

26:40.266 --> 26:41.868
between you
and Clayton.

26:45.337 --> 26:49.141
- 'Cause I don't think
he's stronger than you.
- I think it's all show.

26:49.175 --> 26:51.443
Yeah, I don't think,
I don't think
he's stronger than you.

26:51.477 --> 26:53.713
You know, I think

26:53.746 --> 26:56.448
he's just a,
he's a smotherer.

26:56.482 --> 26:58.150
During that fight,
I wasn't at the potential

26:58.184 --> 27:00.086
that I could have been at,
so when you..

27:00.119 --> 27:01.688
A lot of fights
you kind of think about

27:01.721 --> 27:04.156
and think about,
and think about,
you ever done that before?

27:04.190 --> 27:06.859
And you just, you can't
get it out of your head?

27:06.893 --> 27:07.894
Yeah.

27:10.096 --> 27:11.597
I tell people this
all the time, right

27:11.630 --> 27:13.733
it's like we're all..

27:13.766 --> 27:16.635
something has to be
wrong with us.

27:16.669 --> 27:20.873
Us, because, I -- I get
what you're saying

27:20.907 --> 27:22.641
when you, when you
don't want to quit.

27:22.675 --> 27:24.877
I get it.

27:24.911 --> 27:27.413
I -- I tell everybody,
uh, fighters

27:27.446 --> 27:30.116
fighters are
like strippers. You know.

27:30.149 --> 27:32.451
They're cool
to hang out with,
they're cool to party with

27:32.484 --> 27:35.454
they're cool to freakin'
do whatever with, man

27:35.487 --> 27:37.924
but other than that,
that's it.

27:37.957 --> 27:40.693
I mean, but,
like strippers,
dude, we all

27:40.727 --> 27:43.162
have mental issues,
we all have
some kind of addiction.

27:43.195 --> 27:45.031
We all have, you know

27:45.064 --> 27:47.199
we just
gotta...you know.

27:47.233 --> 27:49.635
Mommy didn't love us.
Daddy touched us too much.

27:49.668 --> 27:52.138
You know what I mean,
I don't know
what the hell it drives

27:52.171 --> 27:54.974
but there's,
there's easier ways
to do things.

27:55.007 --> 27:57.443
And every stripper has
an expiration date.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.081
Yeah.

28:02.114 --> 28:03.916
And they're
single parents.

28:06.518 --> 28:09.321
And I'm a huge fan
of supporting the single
mother movement.

28:17.596 --> 28:19.866
So, you're gonna fight
this Clayton guy again?

28:19.899 --> 28:21.633
Well, again. What --

28:21.667 --> 28:24.603
- Okay, so what if you
lose to him again?
- Then, it's done.

28:24.636 --> 28:26.939
No, you're just going
to be thinking
about it again.

28:26.973 --> 28:28.908
No, because that's,
that's, you lose twice

28:28.941 --> 28:31.010
at something,
I mean, it, it..

28:31.043 --> 28:33.045
I wasn't
at the level

28:33.079 --> 28:35.081
that I usually
train at.

28:35.114 --> 28:38.217
I just, I'm, this is
a new one for me, again

28:38.250 --> 28:42.188
because the last time
we talked, you said,
aah --

28:42.221 --> 28:45.024
I know, I -- I don't want
to argue, I don't want
to fight, but you know --

28:45.057 --> 28:47.293
But you're gonna do
what you want.

28:47.326 --> 28:50.229
And that's that. So..

28:50.262 --> 28:53.265
But I just.. I need
to close that book.

28:53.299 --> 28:56.302
You need. I know.
It's fine.

28:58.337 --> 28:59.806
There's no point
in having a conversation
with you

28:59.839 --> 29:01.440
because you're going to
do what you want anyway.

29:01.473 --> 29:03.109
- That's not true.
- It is true.

29:03.142 --> 29:04.777
Because you said you were
done with Clayton,
and all of a sudden

29:04.811 --> 29:07.079
you're not, right?

29:07.113 --> 29:09.648
How many times
have you done that to me?

29:09.681 --> 29:11.918
We make a decision,
I think you're..

29:11.951 --> 29:13.485
You say, "Yeah,
that's a great idea."

29:13.519 --> 29:15.187
And then you go and do
whatever you want

29:15.221 --> 29:17.656
because, "That's what I
had to do, Nori. You just
don't understand."

29:17.689 --> 29:20.392
Then why did you
agree with me
in the first place?

29:20.426 --> 29:21.861
Because I thought
I could just agree
with you

29:21.894 --> 29:24.096
and move forward.

29:24.130 --> 29:26.999
How many times
have you said,
"This is my last fight.

29:27.033 --> 29:28.700
"Hey, this is
my last fight.

29:28.734 --> 29:31.537
"Just, just kiddin'.
Next fight
is my last fight.

29:31.570 --> 29:34.506
"Wait. One more fight,
one more fight.

29:34.540 --> 29:36.408
"I have
to redeem myself.

29:36.442 --> 29:38.610
"Wait, one more fight.
I need closure.

29:38.644 --> 29:40.412
Wait, one more fight."
It's..

29:42.781 --> 29:44.783
You know?

29:44.817 --> 29:45.918
Okay.

29:54.226 --> 29:55.461
How are you feelin'?

29:55.494 --> 29:57.296
- I'm okay.

29:57.329 --> 29:59.098
Not right now.

29:59.131 --> 30:01.000
Think positive
thoughts.

30:02.301 --> 30:03.469
Don't let this head
mess with you

30:03.502 --> 30:04.803
so the stomach
starts hurting, okay?

30:04.837 --> 30:05.838
Mm-hm.

30:05.872 --> 30:07.573
- Okay.

30:54.020 --> 30:55.955
Come and get it.
Come on.

31:24.450 --> 31:28.154
Anybody have will call
tickets

31:28.187 --> 31:29.455
Will call.

31:33.625 --> 31:35.061
And in the red corner

31:35.094 --> 31:37.863
the reigning
Ax Champion

31:37.896 --> 31:39.631
Clayton Hoy!

31:47.206 --> 31:48.174
Fight!

32:07.960 --> 32:09.028
Go! Go! Go! Go!

32:09.061 --> 32:10.362
That's it!

32:38.290 --> 32:39.825
How're you feeling
overall?

32:39.858 --> 32:41.793
Um, I'm just trying
to get, figure out

32:41.827 --> 32:43.962
um, how to get rid
of this dizziness.

32:43.996 --> 32:45.331
I have, like, these,
like, times

32:45.364 --> 32:47.099
when it comes and goes.

32:47.133 --> 32:48.967
Where if I get up
real fast

32:49.001 --> 32:50.302
I, it's off-balance.

32:50.336 --> 32:51.370
- Right.
- Um..

32:51.403 --> 32:52.638
It feels like,
there's, like, like

32:52.671 --> 32:53.972
vertigo kinda
kickin' in.

32:54.006 --> 32:55.274
So, I'm trying
to figure out
how do we

32:55.307 --> 32:57.043
stop that
from happening.

32:57.076 --> 32:58.610
Okay, and
stand up normal.

32:58.644 --> 32:59.978
Now, head back.

33:00.012 --> 33:01.080
When your head's back,
I want you

33:01.113 --> 33:02.281
to turn right
and stay there.

33:02.314 --> 33:03.349
Back and right.

33:03.382 --> 33:04.650
- And turn..

33:04.683 --> 33:06.118
Turn your head
to the right
at the same time

33:06.152 --> 33:07.919
as going back,
and if there's no pain --

33:07.953 --> 33:08.954
- Whoa. Okay.
- Stand up, oh..

33:08.987 --> 33:10.156
You're losing
some balance there?

33:10.189 --> 33:11.423
Yeah, one second.
One second, one second.

33:11.457 --> 33:12.591
Okay. That's fine.

33:14.960 --> 33:15.994
- Okay.
- Okay.

33:16.028 --> 33:17.329
So that makes you
lose some balance

33:17.363 --> 33:18.330
doing that.

33:23.669 --> 33:25.137
How much do you think
this is caused

33:25.171 --> 33:26.838
from...

33:26.872 --> 33:29.408
my choices
of...competing?

33:29.441 --> 33:31.043
It -- it's hard to say.

33:31.077 --> 33:32.711
So, um, there are
a number of things

33:32.744 --> 33:34.313
that can go on
with concussion

33:34.346 --> 33:36.048
that can cause
balance difficulties.

33:36.082 --> 33:37.783
Uh, there's also things
that can go on

33:37.816 --> 33:38.884
with trauma to the head

33:38.917 --> 33:40.286
so at this point,
the question is

33:40.319 --> 33:41.787
is this actually moving
into something called

33:41.820 --> 33:43.122
post-concussion
syndrome?

33:44.823 --> 33:46.725
Family history
of any conditions

33:46.758 --> 33:48.994
that could be related
or genetic?

33:49.027 --> 33:51.763
My father's, uh..

33:51.797 --> 33:54.633
Uh, he likes to drink.

33:54.666 --> 33:56.868
Okay, would you
say he suffers
from alcoholism?

33:56.902 --> 33:59.405
- I'd say yeah.
- Okay.

33:59.438 --> 34:02.408
That, and, um,
slight bipolar.

34:02.441 --> 34:03.675
Okay.

34:07.746 --> 34:09.815
- And depression.
- Mm-hm.

34:58.397 --> 34:59.465
Get down.

35:00.532 --> 35:02.033
You are dead!

35:07.939 --> 35:10.142
- Dad!
- Yeah.

35:12.311 --> 35:13.379
Dad.

35:15.147 --> 35:16.915
- Not hard enough yet.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.016
You're not squeezing
hard enough yet.

35:18.049 --> 35:19.218
Okay, what?

35:19.251 --> 35:21.387
You're not squeezing
hard enough yet.

35:21.420 --> 35:23.155
Yes, I am!
You sound weird.

35:23.189 --> 35:24.623
No, not yet.

35:24.656 --> 35:25.757
There we go.

35:48.447 --> 35:49.781
Daddy!

35:49.815 --> 35:51.149
- Chicken strips.

35:51.183 --> 35:52.117
Hi.

35:53.552 --> 35:56.154
I was trying to get it
off of my panda.

35:56.188 --> 35:59.891
Girls, hurry up.
Get -- get packed up.

35:59.925 --> 36:01.927
We gotta go.

36:01.960 --> 36:03.629
If we're late,
your mom's
gonna be angry.

36:05.464 --> 36:06.898
- Yup.

36:15.974 --> 36:17.743
Dad, you don't
look very happy.

36:19.010 --> 36:20.946
- I'm not very happy.
- I know.

36:22.214 --> 36:23.715
Your mom's gonna
be really angry.

36:23.749 --> 36:25.217
'Cause I'm dropping
you guys off late.

36:28.487 --> 36:30.222
Oh, gosh, she's
in the red Jeep.

36:30.256 --> 36:31.290
- Okay.
- Yeah.

36:37.062 --> 36:38.264
That sucked.

36:39.665 --> 36:41.667
Delanee just sent me
a text.

36:41.700 --> 36:45.504
It says, "Callie is
already arguing
with my mom.

36:45.537 --> 36:47.573
She can be
so mean sometimes."

36:50.342 --> 36:51.443
Well, I just..

36:51.477 --> 36:54.413
I get tired of the BS.

36:54.446 --> 36:57.015
It's been
too many years, and..

36:57.048 --> 36:58.350
Can't expect her
to change

36:58.384 --> 37:00.319
because she doesn't
think she needs to.

37:02.288 --> 37:03.789
They gotta deal
with the fallout

37:03.822 --> 37:05.324
between me and her.

37:09.194 --> 37:10.896
- Dad, I'll spray you.
- No, no, no. I'm good.

37:10.929 --> 37:11.930
- Rinse off.
- I'm good. I'm good.

37:11.963 --> 37:13.031
- I'm good, I'm good.

37:13.064 --> 37:15.301
I'm good. I'm good.
I'm good..

37:15.334 --> 37:16.668
- Shower.
- I really am good.

37:16.702 --> 37:18.136
Kira, come on!

37:18.169 --> 37:20.105
- No, I'm good.
- Kira!

37:20.138 --> 37:21.540
Daddy, you need
to spray it like me.

37:21.573 --> 37:23.108
I'm okay, I'm okay,
I'm okay.

37:23.141 --> 37:25.311
You just killed
whatever bugs were on me.

37:25.344 --> 37:27.012
You just killed
all your make-up!

37:27.045 --> 37:28.914
My make-up!

37:28.947 --> 37:30.549
Don't touch it,
don't touch it.

37:30.582 --> 37:31.683
Dry it off, mommy.

37:31.717 --> 37:34.653
I can't. I can't touch it.
It's gonna dry.

37:34.686 --> 37:36.121
Aw, man, Mia.

37:36.154 --> 37:37.589
And now,
it's like this..

37:37.623 --> 37:38.624
No, it's not,
don't touch it!

37:38.657 --> 37:39.958
- Don't touch it!
- Daddy!

37:39.991 --> 37:41.259
You sprayed yourself.

37:41.293 --> 37:42.628
- Aw, it's okay, baby.
- It's okay, come here.

37:42.661 --> 37:43.762
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

37:43.795 --> 37:46.131
You just, you forgot.
It's okay.

37:46.164 --> 37:49.335
I'm not mad at you.
What's wrong?

37:49.368 --> 37:50.969
- She looks upset.
- It's okay.

37:51.002 --> 37:52.838
- Here, just don't
touch it, it'll dry.
- We took good pics.

37:52.871 --> 37:54.306
It'll dry.
It's not smeared.

37:56.241 --> 37:58.344
Oh, Lord,
have mercy.

37:58.377 --> 38:01.413
Let me see it.
Let me see it.

38:01.447 --> 38:03.449
Let me see it.
It's not gone.

38:03.482 --> 38:05.384
Yeah, it is.
I looked at it.

38:05.417 --> 38:07.118
I'm looking at it
right now, come here.

38:07.152 --> 38:09.120
No.

38:09.154 --> 38:10.389
I know it's gone!

38:10.422 --> 38:12.257
- You used water!
- Mia, come on.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.893
We'll dab it.
We'll dab it, okay?

38:14.926 --> 38:16.795
Okay?

38:16.828 --> 38:18.163
It'll be fine.

38:23.234 --> 38:25.103
- Okay.

38:25.136 --> 38:26.672
You knew she was
gonna freak out

38:26.705 --> 38:27.773
and you were like, "Ooh

38:27.806 --> 38:29.274
it's smearing
down your face now."

38:29.307 --> 38:30.776
She sprayed water
on herself!

38:38.550 --> 38:39.818
Knee-ride.

38:47.659 --> 38:50.261
Come on, fearless leader.
Bring it in.

38:50.295 --> 38:52.631
Guys,
very good job today.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.866
Super loud,
united on three.

38:54.900 --> 38:56.635
- One, two, three!
- United!

38:56.668 --> 38:58.069
Good job, guys.

39:01.707 --> 39:03.942
Hey, Joe, I thought
we were getting ready
to do some sit-ups.

39:06.244 --> 39:07.713
I got served papers,
so that's why

39:07.746 --> 39:08.980
I've been really
stressed out today, so..

39:09.014 --> 39:11.417
What'd you get
served papers for?

39:11.450 --> 39:13.485
My ex-wife, she wants
to move to Spokane

39:13.519 --> 39:15.687
and she wants to take
Callie and Delanee
out with her.

39:15.721 --> 39:17.489
That's why I've been
really depressed, so..

39:22.628 --> 39:23.795
So..

39:23.829 --> 39:25.497
What're you
gonna do, man?

39:25.531 --> 39:26.598
I don't know.

39:26.632 --> 39:28.066
I'm trying just to
focus on the fight.

39:28.099 --> 39:29.701
I was working out,
and here, this guy,
he says

39:29.735 --> 39:31.102
"Hey, Joe Carman?"
I was, like,
going, "Yeah."

39:31.136 --> 39:32.904
I thought he was
a new client coming in.

39:32.938 --> 39:34.039
He's, like, going,
"You've been served."

39:34.072 --> 39:35.974
I go, "Huh?"
And I was like going

39:36.007 --> 39:37.308
"Oh, that's nice."

39:38.343 --> 39:40.145
Everything changed
all at once.

39:40.178 --> 39:41.647
Okay.

39:43.114 --> 39:46.317
That sucks, but we
have a task at hand.

39:46.351 --> 39:47.586
- I know.

39:47.619 --> 39:49.621
Right now, try to,
as much as it sucks

39:49.655 --> 39:51.590
I know, i -- it,
it's, it's easier
said than done.

39:51.623 --> 39:53.425
Try to put it
out of your mind,
and let's focus

39:53.459 --> 39:56.127
on the task at hand.
Okay?

39:56.161 --> 39:57.262
- Okay.
- Okay.

40:04.803 --> 40:06.905
- Hi.
- Hey.

40:06.938 --> 40:08.874
Well, not your -- not
your mouth, your hand.

40:08.907 --> 40:10.576
Nope.

40:10.609 --> 40:12.210
Shake hands.

40:14.245 --> 40:15.681
Like that.

40:17.115 --> 40:18.750
It's still okay
to make it steamy.

40:21.386 --> 40:23.522
This is terrible.
This is so terrible.

40:23.555 --> 40:24.690
I want to see.

40:24.723 --> 40:26.391
Can you show me
afterward?

40:33.799 --> 40:34.733
Question.

40:36.001 --> 40:38.604
If you do move,
what're you guys gonna do?

40:38.637 --> 40:42.107
There's nothing
over there, nothing.

40:42.140 --> 40:45.511
If they leave you,
and you guys are there
by yourself..

40:45.544 --> 40:48.880
What's gonna happen?
Callie, well, you know..

40:48.914 --> 40:52.918
Like, uh, she gets like,
kind of a shell
around her.

40:52.951 --> 40:55.887
That's my concern.

40:55.921 --> 40:58.123
When I was growing up,
I didn't feel like

40:58.156 --> 41:00.025
I fit in a lot with
a lot of people
around me.

41:00.058 --> 41:03.094
But you're Big Joe.
Everybody likes you.

41:03.128 --> 41:04.896
Yeah, but it
wasn't like that.

41:04.930 --> 41:07.866
I became more,
um, enclosed.

41:07.899 --> 41:09.568
And built more walls up.

41:10.569 --> 41:12.437
I became destructive.

41:13.872 --> 41:15.707
And that's why
I got a lot of fights.

41:15.741 --> 41:17.976
But what I don't
want to happen is

41:18.009 --> 41:20.579
I don't want you
to be like me.

41:45.771 --> 41:48.273
Get it up, Joe, come on!
Above your head.

41:53.111 --> 41:55.113
Ten more seconds, Joe.

41:55.146 --> 41:56.582
Don't let it fall.

41:56.615 --> 41:58.049
Don't let it fall.
Five more seconds.

41:58.083 --> 41:59.718
Come on, get it up.

41:59.751 --> 42:00.786
Come on, go.

42:03.955 --> 42:04.956
Go.

42:06.191 --> 42:07.525
Come on, Joe.

42:12.130 --> 42:13.331
If this song
doesn't make you wanna

42:13.364 --> 42:16.101
piggyback a man
around in a hot room

42:16.134 --> 42:18.503
nothing will.
That's right.

42:18.536 --> 42:20.438
Sweet Jesus, Joe!

42:27.779 --> 42:29.981
Suck into him,
Sebastian.

42:30.015 --> 42:31.349
All the way
to the wood, Joe.

42:39.390 --> 42:40.391
- Come on, Joe.
- Let's go.

42:40.425 --> 42:41.793
Joe, come on.

42:41.827 --> 42:44.562
Joe, let's go!
Let's go, come on, man!

42:47.365 --> 42:48.900
Let's get up, come on.

42:48.934 --> 42:51.837
All you gotta do
is crawl across
the mat, let's go.

42:53.705 --> 42:55.240
Joe, let's go!

42:57.008 --> 42:59.645
What looks more impressive
at the end of a round?

42:59.678 --> 43:01.379
Somebody who raises
their hands

43:01.412 --> 43:02.814
and is all excited..

43:02.848 --> 43:04.850
...or somebody
who falls over?

43:10.188 --> 43:11.589
Joe, get up!

43:19.698 --> 43:21.566
Sebastian, roll him over,
please.

43:31.643 --> 43:32.944
Goddammit!

43:49.327 --> 43:50.762
Un-fuckin'-real.

44:00.505 --> 44:03.742
Could you..
Let me see his lips.

44:03.775 --> 44:05.243
Are you feeling pale?

44:05.276 --> 44:07.045
- No.
- He's just overheated.

44:07.078 --> 44:09.414
His lips are blue too.

44:09.447 --> 44:10.882
If you can
get him some sugar

44:10.916 --> 44:13.251
so his glucose levels
are dropped..

44:13.284 --> 44:14.485
So, just get him
some sugar.

44:14.519 --> 44:15.553
Gatorade?

44:15.586 --> 44:16.654
- Yeah. Yeah.

44:16.688 --> 44:18.423
Gatorade is actually
really good. Yeah.

44:25.731 --> 44:27.799
Take your Gatorade.

44:27.833 --> 44:29.667
Again, more
fuckin' fluid

44:29.701 --> 44:31.903
we gotta get out
of your system.

44:31.937 --> 44:33.338
You know? Come on.

44:38.844 --> 44:41.446
Joe, I know
you want this fight.

44:41.479 --> 44:42.714
But I would like
for you to have

44:42.748 --> 44:45.216
a couple of more fights
under your belt

44:45.250 --> 44:46.985
before we take
this fight with Clayton.

44:49.187 --> 44:51.757
You're just not
ready yet. So..

44:52.758 --> 44:53.892
Okay.

44:56.061 --> 44:57.195
My family
is gonna kill me.

44:57.228 --> 44:59.064
Yeah.

44:59.097 --> 45:00.665
You have to
drop down weight?

45:00.698 --> 45:01.933
Probably.

45:01.967 --> 45:04.035
So three fights, where?

45:04.069 --> 45:05.837
Well, around here,
locally, probably.

45:07.973 --> 45:09.474
Why didn't you tell us
about it?

45:09.507 --> 45:10.809
I didn't, I..

45:13.678 --> 45:15.213
What happens
if you get hurt?

45:20.085 --> 45:22.320
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Mia, Mia, Mia. Mia.

45:22.353 --> 45:23.621
Only Callie and I.
Only Callie and I.

45:23.654 --> 45:25.023
- No, let me go.
- Only Callie.

45:25.056 --> 45:26.491
- Me too.
- Mia, go.

45:26.524 --> 45:28.860
- Can I just --
- I mean it. Cal!

45:28.894 --> 45:30.762
Mia! I just need to talk
to Callie for a minute.

45:30.796 --> 45:32.030
- I wanna talk to her too.
- Okay, well.

45:32.063 --> 45:33.564
Just a minute.
Mia, I'm serious.

45:33.598 --> 45:34.732
I'm trying to have
a talk with Callie.

45:34.766 --> 45:36.835
I'm talking, too.

45:36.868 --> 45:38.469
I'll just sit here
and watch.

45:40.872 --> 45:43.775
- Again, he lied.
- Okay, I know, but..

45:44.910 --> 45:46.845
He wants to do
three more fights

45:46.878 --> 45:48.146
and then go pro
with Clayton.

45:48.179 --> 45:49.247
He said one!

45:49.280 --> 45:51.382
Yeah, he just said he's,
he's doing three.

45:51.416 --> 45:52.717
I thought he said he's not
going to fight anymore.

45:52.750 --> 45:54.352
No, he's doing
three more fights

45:54.385 --> 45:56.554
and then he wants
to fight Clayton again.

45:56.587 --> 45:57.588
Why?

45:57.622 --> 45:59.624
Do you like
that he lied to us?

45:59.657 --> 46:01.927
He's still your dad.
You know?

46:01.960 --> 46:03.528
I know that. I'm not
saying I don't love him.

46:03.561 --> 46:05.797
You, you don't have
to argue and stuff.

46:05.831 --> 46:06.998
- It's okay.
- I don't..

46:07.032 --> 46:09.634
No, it's not okay. Mia,
you don't understand.

46:09.667 --> 46:11.302
I actually
do understand.

46:11.336 --> 46:12.670
Yeah, but when you
bring up that--

46:12.703 --> 46:14.505
Callie, you're gonna
just bring it up at home.

46:14.539 --> 46:16.441
And then, mommy is gonna
get all angry at daddy

46:16.474 --> 46:17.708
and they're gonna
be in a big fight.

46:17.742 --> 46:18.810
And mommy says next time

46:18.844 --> 46:20.178
she's gonna leave
the house

46:20.211 --> 46:23.114
with -- and go
to grandpa's.

46:23.148 --> 46:24.749
I don't want
to do it anymore!

46:24.782 --> 46:26.217
I don't want that
to happen either

46:26.251 --> 46:29.054
but it's not our fault.

46:29.087 --> 46:32.090
He caused this.
I'm not trying
to blame him.

46:32.123 --> 46:34.325
- I'm just saying --
- But you're just gonna
bring it up at home.

46:34.359 --> 46:36.127
I'm not trying
to make it a big deal.

46:36.161 --> 46:38.463
I don't want them
to fight, but --

46:38.496 --> 46:39.931
You're going
to make 'em.

46:39.965 --> 46:42.000
I'm not going
to make them fight.

46:42.033 --> 46:44.335
Just, like..

46:44.369 --> 46:46.071
I can't drop this.

46:46.104 --> 46:47.305
- Well, don't drop it.
- Don't drop it!

46:47.338 --> 46:49.174
Just don't bring it up
while we're at home.

46:49.207 --> 46:52.310
- Please!
- That's the only time
that I can bring it up.

46:52.343 --> 46:55.746
You guys are just, like,
"Oh, well, you know

46:55.780 --> 46:57.815
What -- what's ever
happening is happening."

46:57.849 --> 47:00.118
I don't think we can
really do anything
about it

47:00.151 --> 47:02.220
when we probably can
do something about it.

47:02.253 --> 47:03.654
- We can talk to him.
- We can't, Callie!

47:03.688 --> 47:05.924
- It's his,
it -- it's him.
- Try to change his mind.

47:05.957 --> 47:07.692
He can do
whatever he wants.

47:07.725 --> 47:09.327
- Yeah, but --
- He doesn't listen to us.

47:09.360 --> 47:10.561
I know, that's why

47:10.595 --> 47:11.963
I want to bring it up
to make it clear.

47:11.997 --> 47:13.398
But I don't want to.
And I don't want --

47:13.431 --> 47:14.532
And you don't have to.

47:14.565 --> 47:16.567
But why do you have
to bring it up at home?

47:19.204 --> 47:21.873
I don't think
this is ever gonna end.

47:37.188 --> 47:38.456
Hi, daddy.

47:39.724 --> 47:42.227
I'm, I'm not feelin'
too hot today.

47:43.261 --> 47:45.730
Joe's got
a stupid fight, so..

47:45.763 --> 47:48.099
And I'm just being
a grouchy bitch, so..

47:50.936 --> 47:52.037
Yeah.

47:53.471 --> 47:55.840
I do hurt 24-7.

48:02.113 --> 48:03.548
I'm just sick
of hurtin' him.

48:03.581 --> 48:06.151
And I'm sick
of being trapped here.

48:06.184 --> 48:07.953
I'm sick of fucking Joe

48:07.986 --> 48:09.687
doing whatever
the fuck he wants.

48:09.720 --> 48:11.923
And...you know

48:11.957 --> 48:15.326
I'm just sick,
and I'm stuck here

48:15.360 --> 48:18.363
with all his mess,
and fuckin' goats.

48:18.396 --> 48:21.499
I'm just...pissed off.

48:25.436 --> 48:28.206
Yeah, I don't
like myself much.

48:28.239 --> 48:29.407
Yeah.

48:32.343 --> 48:33.744
I'm just tired.

49:18.656 --> 49:19.624
Tap! It's over!

49:26.531 --> 49:28.033
Look like a warrior.

49:30.935 --> 49:33.804
The winner via
submission in armbar

49:33.838 --> 49:36.907
give it up
for Joe Carman!

49:41.212 --> 49:43.114
You got the win, dude!
Yeah!

49:43.148 --> 49:44.882
- That was
a good fight, man.
- Thank you.

49:44.915 --> 49:46.317
I've never been
to one before.

49:46.351 --> 49:47.618
This was awesome.
Nice job.

49:47.652 --> 49:48.886
Hope it was exciting
for you guys to watch.

49:48.919 --> 49:50.821
- It really was.
- Hey, great fight, man.

49:50.855 --> 49:53.024
Oh, thank you.
Appreciate it.
I appreciate it.

49:53.058 --> 49:54.492
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

49:55.826 --> 49:56.994
- Yeah.
- Forty.

49:59.430 --> 50:00.598
Can I take a picture
with you?

50:00.631 --> 50:01.599
Oh, yeah.

50:07.805 --> 50:09.940
Alright, Joe.
You ready?

50:12.977 --> 50:14.979
Alrighty.
There you go.

50:15.012 --> 50:16.081
Thank you.

50:23.221 --> 50:24.289
I know.

50:55.420 --> 50:57.888
- I'm okay.

50:57.922 --> 51:00.225
- No.

51:00.258 --> 51:02.593
Am I allowed to talk
to them

51:02.627 --> 51:04.429
I just want to see
how she's doing.

51:05.630 --> 51:07.398
How is she going
to receive that?

51:07.432 --> 51:08.899
Oh, okay.

51:08.933 --> 51:10.401
Alright, we're back
on the record

51:10.435 --> 51:16.274
with respect to clause
number 013039460.

51:16.307 --> 51:18.876
This is
a relocation case

51:18.909 --> 51:20.378
where Miss Haverfield

51:20.411 --> 51:22.980
is seeking to move
her family

51:23.013 --> 51:24.115
to Stevens County.

51:24.149 --> 51:27.118
And Mr. Carman
is opposing the move.

51:27.152 --> 51:29.487
There is evidence
that was produced
in trial

51:29.520 --> 51:31.689
that showed
that Mrs. Haverfield

51:31.722 --> 51:35.160
really is dependable,
consistent

51:35.193 --> 51:36.894
and involved
in every aspect

51:36.927 --> 51:38.696
of the girls'
daily needs.

51:38.729 --> 51:41.566
Mr. Carman is in
a different situation.

51:41.599 --> 51:43.168
He works
for the ferry system

51:43.201 --> 51:45.470
and he has his gym.

51:45.503 --> 51:47.205
Uh, that makes him
a very busy man.

51:47.238 --> 51:48.939
Now, and on top of that

51:48.973 --> 51:51.409
he has two
other children

51:51.442 --> 51:53.178
and a wife, and a family

51:53.211 --> 51:55.213
that he's, uh, managing.

51:55.246 --> 51:57.582
I think this factor
favors relocation

51:57.615 --> 52:01.018
because of the girls'
strong connection
with their mother.

52:01.051 --> 52:04.355
Her constant
and dependable presence
in their lives.

52:06.457 --> 52:08.159
So, I'm going
to allow it.

52:11.429 --> 52:12.497
Okay.

52:14.265 --> 52:15.766
It's going --
it's going to be okay.

52:15.800 --> 52:17.968
Did they call her out
on her being a liar?

52:18.002 --> 52:19.237
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

52:19.270 --> 52:20.971
I'll come down, when I
come down and talk to you

52:21.005 --> 52:22.006
we'll get
more details of it.

52:22.039 --> 52:24.309
But right now,
it -- it --

52:24.342 --> 52:25.443
- Alright.
- Alright.

52:25.476 --> 52:27.378
Don't cry, relax.
We'll be alright.

52:27.412 --> 52:29.614
- Okay.

52:29.647 --> 52:31.382
Alright, I love you.

52:31.416 --> 52:32.650
- Bye.
- Bye.

52:41.492 --> 52:42.893
Yup. Well..

52:42.927 --> 52:46.331
- I'm sorry, baby.
- It's alright.

52:46.364 --> 52:50.601
- Just you by yourself
in the courtroom today?
- Yeah.

52:50.635 --> 52:52.503
So it wouldn't have done
any -- wouldn't have done
any good

52:52.537 --> 52:53.904
if we were
there, anyhow.

52:53.938 --> 52:54.905
You're right, dad,
there would have been

52:54.939 --> 52:56.274
no advantage at all.

52:56.307 --> 52:58.008
Well, if I had known..

52:58.042 --> 52:59.677
- I told you guys.
- He told us.

52:59.710 --> 53:00.811
- But he, we probably --
- Months in advance.

53:00.845 --> 53:02.413
- We probably forgot.
- Well, okay.

53:02.447 --> 53:04.249
And what would've been,
what would've been
the advantage?

53:04.282 --> 53:05.983
We were going to say
positive things about Joe.

53:06.016 --> 53:08.152
Okay, so, just, her,
they're saying
positive things about her.

53:08.185 --> 53:09.153
We could've said
something positive
about Joe.

53:09.186 --> 53:10.154
- Yes.
- Okay.

53:10.187 --> 53:11.622
And we weren't there
to say it.

53:11.656 --> 53:13.324
Okay.

53:13.358 --> 53:15.860
A month before that,
we should've
sat down and planned.

53:15.893 --> 53:17.094
Two months before
in advance..

53:17.127 --> 53:18.929
- You should've came over.
- I gave you a li..

53:18.963 --> 53:21.198
- Yeah, he did.
- We should've sat down
and planned a strategy.

53:21.232 --> 53:24.101
Two months, two months
before the court case

53:24.134 --> 53:26.304
- I gave her the list
of things to talk about.
- He did, he did.

53:26.337 --> 53:28.439
There was
a topic conversation
to talk about.

53:28.473 --> 53:31.075
You know it happened,
'cause the attorney
gave it to you!

53:31.108 --> 53:32.677
The attorney
gave you a list.

53:32.710 --> 53:34.845
- Yes, I printed it out.
- They gave her a list
of talking points.

53:34.879 --> 53:37.081
They go, "This is
a talking point
for your father.

53:37.114 --> 53:38.883
- This is a talking point
for your mother."
- Okay.

53:38.916 --> 53:41.386
He goes, "Who's coming?"
I go, "None."

53:41.419 --> 53:44.855
Just agree that
we haven't done it,
that's all.

53:44.889 --> 53:47.224
I'm saying,
we have not done it
as much as we could.

53:47.258 --> 53:49.627
Because we got caught up
in our own life! Yeah.

53:49.660 --> 53:51.829
- I'm saying, I didn't --
- So we are guilty.

53:51.862 --> 53:52.830
I'm not saying guilt..
I'm not using --

53:52.863 --> 53:54.064
We are, we are.
No, we are.

53:54.098 --> 53:55.199
Guilty is that you
did something wrong.

53:55.232 --> 53:56.401
- No, we are.
- You did!

53:56.434 --> 53:58.102
- Stanley, we are.
- You did something wrong!

53:58.135 --> 54:01.171
It's just another
one of those subjects
all through the years, Joe

54:01.205 --> 54:04.609
where something
has occurred, and now,
you gotta go from here.

54:04.642 --> 54:06.411
Your mom's
admitting this

54:06.444 --> 54:09.179
I don't recall,
and you're disappointed.

54:09.213 --> 54:11.282
And you don't
think anybody
in the family cares.

54:11.316 --> 54:13.384
- They don't!
- And so there's nothing
I can say to you.

54:13.418 --> 54:15.820
Okay, all we can do
is apologize

54:15.853 --> 54:17.722
and he's already
kicked down enough.

54:17.755 --> 54:19.223
Why don't
we just stop here?

54:19.256 --> 54:20.725
- I don't want
to do this.
- Okay.

54:20.758 --> 54:23.260
- And, you know,
I feel really bad.
- I feel horrible, too.

54:23.294 --> 54:24.895
Then, how come
you don't admit
to nothing then, dad?

54:24.929 --> 54:26.731
Then, just, you know,
admit that we,
we, you know

54:26.764 --> 54:29.300
we haven't done it,
because we haven't.

54:29.334 --> 54:31.235
Okay, well, I don't
like the idea

54:31.268 --> 54:33.270
of being misconstrued
like we don't care.

54:33.304 --> 54:35.506
It isn't about caring,
it's we haven't
made the time.

54:35.540 --> 54:36.574
Well, that's
the implication.

54:36.607 --> 54:37.808
"You did this,
you did that

54:37.842 --> 54:38.976
you didn't show up
for this

54:39.009 --> 54:40.311
I can't count on you."

54:40.345 --> 54:42.580
I mean, this is all
negative pessimistic
garbage.

54:42.613 --> 54:43.714
- I don't need
to hear this at all.
- Stan, okay.

54:43.748 --> 54:45.115
He went to court,
and he could've

54:45.149 --> 54:47.084
maybe got a better deal

54:47.117 --> 54:49.153
if we would have
at least been there to.

54:49.186 --> 54:51.656
- We didn't. We didn't.
- I don't, I don't even
care about the deal.

54:51.689 --> 54:53.458
- That's what led to it.
- I don't even care
about the deal.

54:53.491 --> 54:55.760
You know what I wanted?
The support!

54:55.793 --> 54:58.529
I mean, I've,
I've heard the stories
about how you got

54:58.563 --> 55:01.466
supposedly kicked out
of the house when
you were just a teenager.

55:01.499 --> 55:05.302
Off on your own.
All fallacies,
fallacies everywhere, Joe.

55:05.336 --> 55:07.271
I wasn't living
over at different
people's houses.

55:07.304 --> 55:09.239
You did this
all on your own.

55:09.273 --> 55:10.675
You created
all this yourself.

55:10.708 --> 55:12.009
What'd you say to me?

55:12.042 --> 55:13.277
You revolted
against this family.

55:13.310 --> 55:14.579
You said,
"Get out of this house.

55:14.612 --> 55:15.680
- Quit causing problems. "
- No, I didn't.

55:15.713 --> 55:16.747
Don't even,
don't even go there, Joe.

55:16.781 --> 55:17.815
You didn't
say that, dad?

55:17.848 --> 55:19.350
- You ran away, Joe.
- Stan!

55:19.384 --> 55:20.651
Nobody kicked you
out of the house.

55:20.685 --> 55:22.687
Something, a switch
turned on your head.

55:22.720 --> 55:24.288
- And you
were anti-family.
- Stan.

55:24.321 --> 55:26.123
For many years,
many years.

55:26.156 --> 55:27.392
You don't want
to keep going there.

55:27.425 --> 55:28.393
- You really don't.
- Go ahead, keep going!

55:28.426 --> 55:29.894
Stan, please stop!

55:29.927 --> 55:31.261
- You're going to say--
- I don't want to do it.

55:31.295 --> 55:32.630
- You're going to say--
- You're bothering me!

55:32.663 --> 55:35.065
You take no responsibility
for any of this.

55:35.099 --> 55:37.735
I'm saying you gotta stop
candy-coating your life

55:37.768 --> 55:40.237
where you're, like,
such a great big,
wonderful person.

55:40.270 --> 55:41.706
- I never do.
- When you're really not.

55:41.739 --> 55:45.142
- Okay, stop! No more.
- It's total manipulation.

55:45.175 --> 55:46.911
- Oh, my God.
- The big, the big hero.

55:46.944 --> 55:48.379
- The big everything.
- Stanley, stop!

55:48.413 --> 55:49.380
- I'm tired of it.
- Mom.

55:49.414 --> 55:50.615
- I'm tired of it.

55:51.949 --> 55:52.883
Stan?

55:56.353 --> 55:57.555
Don't leave, Joe.

56:05.630 --> 56:07.097
He thinks he's perfect.

56:07.131 --> 56:09.800
I know, I know.

56:09.834 --> 56:11.702
Just do it for me.

56:15.339 --> 56:16.841
- Please.
- Yup.

56:19.610 --> 56:21.779
Will you just make peace?
Just make peace.

56:21.812 --> 56:22.913
How many times
have I made peace?

56:22.947 --> 56:24.314
I know.
Just one more time.

56:24.348 --> 56:25.816
How many times
have I made peace?

56:25.850 --> 56:27.752
Just, just
do it, please.

56:32.857 --> 56:34.124
Please.

56:36.861 --> 56:38.062
Please.

57:03.320 --> 57:05.790
There is a young man.

57:05.823 --> 57:07.525
Slightly unshaven.

57:09.460 --> 57:12.763
Let's see, there's,
Dave's over there.
Dave's tent.

57:12.797 --> 57:14.431
Mike's and Joe's.

57:14.465 --> 57:17.468
I see an orange tent,
a gray one

57:17.502 --> 57:19.403
and some..

57:19.436 --> 57:22.239
Somebody just asked me
what am I doing.

57:22.272 --> 57:24.575
Let's see if we can
find that person.

57:24.609 --> 57:28.412
- Joe.
- With long hair.

57:28.445 --> 57:31.482
We're not sure
who this individual
is, but..

57:31.516 --> 57:33.518
Come on, come on.

57:33.551 --> 57:35.052
Shut up,
let's play Frisbee.

57:35.085 --> 57:37.054
- Let's play Frisbee.

57:37.087 --> 57:38.756
Hey, I want to play
with that Frisbee.

57:40.324 --> 57:41.391
Let's go!

57:57.608 --> 58:00.911
- Oh!
- Oh, my God, that hurt.

58:00.945 --> 58:01.879
Fun!

58:06.350 --> 58:07.351
Wait!
Wait, wait.

58:09.854 --> 58:11.055
I'm going in, mommy.

58:13.891 --> 58:15.359
Kira, stand up, baby.

58:15.392 --> 58:16.961
Come on, girls,
let's go.

58:16.994 --> 58:18.996
I gotta stop by the gym
on the way home.

58:23.433 --> 58:25.335
Yes, yeah, this was,
uh, thrown together
real quick

58:25.369 --> 58:27.605
but I want the guys
to get some experience,
so..

58:27.638 --> 58:29.139
Just real quick
getting 'em in so.

58:29.173 --> 58:30.207
- Awesome.
- Thank you.

58:32.610 --> 58:35.245
Show-off!

58:35.279 --> 58:36.947
When did you
grow so tall?

58:36.981 --> 58:39.083
I don't know,
I'm taller than Delanee!

58:39.116 --> 58:40.985
- I know. Yeah.

58:41.018 --> 58:42.119
I'm a little
taller than Delanee.

58:42.152 --> 58:43.220
You're almost
as tall as Callie.

58:43.253 --> 58:45.089
- Get down!
- Hey.

58:45.122 --> 58:46.490
- Down, Kira.
- I think you are.

58:46.523 --> 58:49.126
She's gonna get ya.
Pretty soon.

58:49.159 --> 58:50.995
No, I'm going to be
as tall as him.

58:51.028 --> 58:52.429
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

58:52.462 --> 58:53.397
No, you're not.

58:55.700 --> 58:58.736
And here comes her,
here comes her oppo--

58:58.769 --> 58:59.937
No, it's my turn.

58:59.970 --> 59:01.739
So the girls are still
all livin' with you?

59:01.772 --> 59:03.473
Yeah, my ex-wife,
she can't move
for a while

59:03.507 --> 59:05.175
so I've got them
a little longer.

59:07.177 --> 59:09.113
Kira Carman!

59:11.181 --> 59:14.585
She weighs
a hundred pounds.

59:14.619 --> 59:18.889
And let's get
ready to rumble!

59:18.923 --> 59:22.526
Callie takes Kira
down from the throne.

59:22.559 --> 59:24.094
Callie is blocking!

59:26.363 --> 59:27.331
Girl fight.

59:31.268 --> 59:33.037
Go ahead.
Kira, get her.

59:34.571 --> 59:36.406
Kira, come on, come on!
Come on, Kira, turn!

59:36.440 --> 59:37.507
Yeah, turn it!
Turn, turn, turn, turn..

59:37.541 --> 59:39.777
Yeah!
Ah, don't pull her hair.

59:39.810 --> 59:41.979
No hair pulling!
No hair pulling!

59:42.012 --> 59:43.681
Okay, here we go, girls,
good job.

59:44.649 --> 59:45.650
Yay!

59:46.684 --> 59:48.485
Good job, guys.
Turn. Turn.

59:48.518 --> 59:49.954
She's giving me
an evil look.

59:49.987 --> 59:53.357
Come here, come here,
stop, stop, stop, okay?

59:53.390 --> 59:56.661
Ah, ah, we don't cry.
We don't cry, alright?

59:56.694 --> 59:57.795
- Mm-hm.

59:57.828 --> 59:59.463
You did a good job,
alright?

59:59.496 --> 1:00:02.967
Heads up. Head up.
Good? Okay.

1:00:08.238 --> 1:00:10.074
- Yeah.

1:00:12.843 --> 1:00:14.812
Do you think I could come
to one of your fights?

1:00:14.845 --> 1:00:15.813
I think it would
be great.

1:00:15.846 --> 1:00:16.881
You know, I'd love
to see you guys

1:00:16.914 --> 1:00:18.048
in there to watch
the fight.

1:00:18.082 --> 1:00:20.250
But I know how much
you guys were totally

1:00:20.284 --> 1:00:22.019
against it at first.

1:00:22.052 --> 1:00:23.220
So, I just want you,
I don't want you to

1:00:23.253 --> 1:00:24.989
get your hopes up
and expect to see

1:00:25.022 --> 1:00:26.290
something that..

1:00:27.391 --> 1:00:28.659
You know what I mean?

1:00:34.298 --> 1:00:36.433
What are you doin',
Callie

1:00:57.988 --> 1:00:59.189
What?

1:00:59.223 --> 1:01:00.424
Who's that?

1:01:00.457 --> 1:01:02.626
- No.

1:01:02.659 --> 1:01:04.795
- Oh, my God.

1:01:06.063 --> 1:01:09.566
He's scary-looking.
Don't fight him.

1:01:09.599 --> 1:01:12.302
Daddy, don't fight him.

1:01:12.336 --> 1:01:14.138
- He's..
- That's fake.

1:01:14.171 --> 1:01:16.340
- That's so Botox.
- Yeah, yeah.

1:01:16.373 --> 1:01:17.374
That's botoxed?

1:01:37.161 --> 1:01:38.495
Alright, ladies
and gentlemen

1:01:38.528 --> 1:01:39.663
we are going
to get started

1:01:39.696 --> 1:01:41.198
in a couple
of minutes over here.

1:02:23.107 --> 1:02:24.374
Get your mind right,
buddy.

1:02:24.408 --> 1:02:25.742
Brush that shit off.

1:02:25.776 --> 1:02:27.711
Let's do it, man!

1:02:27.744 --> 1:02:28.946
Do it, man,
let's do it!

1:02:38.188 --> 1:02:40.257
Blue corner
to the ring, please!

1:03:08.986 --> 1:03:10.254
Let's go!

1:03:21.298 --> 1:03:22.566
Come on!

1:03:35.980 --> 1:03:37.414
Good Effort!

1:03:37.447 --> 1:03:39.283
Come on, daddy!

1:03:39.316 --> 1:03:40.584
Come on, daddy!

1:03:54.899 --> 1:03:56.867
- Come on, daddy!
- Mia, it's okay,
it's okay.

1:03:58.869 --> 1:04:00.971
Mia, it's okay.
It's okay.

1:04:11.882 --> 1:04:13.317
Yeah!

1:04:17.988 --> 1:04:21.758
The winner in the first
round, Rodriguez!

1:04:34.238 --> 1:04:35.872
Oh, shit.

1:04:47.017 --> 1:04:48.986
Squeeze it in there.

1:04:49.019 --> 1:04:50.520
Can you do it?
- No, okay, no.

1:04:53.790 --> 1:04:56.226
I probably could have
kept going, but..

1:04:56.260 --> 1:04:57.427
...I couldn't,
I couldn't really

1:04:57.461 --> 1:04:59.629
I couldn't, um,
I couldn't see him.

1:04:59.663 --> 1:05:01.898
It was spinning, really.
No, I can't go in there.

1:05:01.932 --> 1:05:04.668
I hear it in
your voice. You're
not really there.

1:05:04.701 --> 1:05:06.270
Does the cold water feel
good on your head?

1:05:06.303 --> 1:05:07.671
No, I don't
even feel it.

1:05:07.704 --> 1:05:08.973
You don't even feel it?

1:06:13.337 --> 1:06:14.671
Real smart.

1:06:14.704 --> 1:06:16.640
What were you thinking,
taking them to the fight?

1:06:18.275 --> 1:06:19.909
You know,
I can't rely on you

1:06:19.943 --> 1:06:20.910
to take care
of this family

1:06:20.944 --> 1:06:22.546
because you do
stupid shit.

1:06:22.579 --> 1:06:24.348
You said you wanted
to raise
your kids differently

1:06:24.381 --> 1:06:26.616
not how you were raised,
but look
what you're doing.

1:06:26.650 --> 1:06:28.052
I'm being supportive
for you, too

1:06:28.085 --> 1:06:29.986
and trying right now to
deal with your situation.

1:06:30.020 --> 1:06:31.888
Deal with my situation?
I'll fucking leave then.

1:06:31.921 --> 1:06:33.490
- You won't have to --
- But where you
gonna live?

1:06:33.523 --> 1:06:35.325
I'll just go live with
my grandma or something.

1:06:35.359 --> 1:06:37.194
And then you're going
to just leave the kids?

1:06:37.227 --> 1:06:38.795
No, they're comin'.

1:06:38.828 --> 1:06:40.397
That's what you want?

1:06:40.430 --> 1:06:42.199
I've been dealing
with you
and your situation

1:06:42.232 --> 1:06:44.101
since we got married.

1:06:44.134 --> 1:06:46.370
- If you don't want to be
with me, then leave.
- Fine.

1:06:46.403 --> 1:06:48.772
You don't wanna be
a part of me?
You don't wanna be --

1:06:48.805 --> 1:06:49.939
- Don't wanna be
a part of me?
- No, no, no.

1:06:49.973 --> 1:06:51.007
You don't want to be
a part of me?

1:06:51.041 --> 1:06:52.276
- You don't wanna be..

1:06:52.309 --> 1:06:53.843
You don't ever want
to fucking be here.

1:06:53.877 --> 1:06:56.113
- You'd rather do
anything than be here.

1:06:56.146 --> 1:06:57.647
Because this
is what I get.

1:06:57.681 --> 1:06:59.283
Ask them if they want
to be around you.

1:06:59.316 --> 1:07:01.385
Ask them. Ask them
if they want
to be around you.

1:07:01.418 --> 1:07:03.553
They'll say all the time.
"We don't want
to be with mommy.

1:07:03.587 --> 1:07:05.389
"We don't want
to be with mommy.
We can't take her.

1:07:05.422 --> 1:07:07.224
She always yells.
She always screams.
She's always mad at us."

1:07:07.257 --> 1:07:08.725
I'm leaving,
so it doesn't matter.

1:07:08.758 --> 1:07:11.295
- Mommy, please don't.
- You're coming with me.

1:07:11.328 --> 1:07:13.197
Mommy, I want to stay.
I want --

1:07:13.230 --> 1:07:14.664
Daddy won't be around.

1:07:14.698 --> 1:07:17.101
You're gonna be
by yourself.

1:07:17.134 --> 1:07:19.035
Keep goin', Joe,
you're forty years old

1:07:19.069 --> 1:07:21.305
with a freakin'
head injury.

1:07:21.338 --> 1:07:22.606
Keep goin'.

1:07:38.255 --> 1:07:40.190
I'm so sorry.

1:07:42.226 --> 1:07:43.593
Can I go with you?

1:07:44.828 --> 1:07:47.364
You sure? Okay.

1:07:47.397 --> 1:07:48.965
I love you.

1:08:11.688 --> 1:08:13.323
- Dad.

1:08:13.357 --> 1:08:15.892
- Daddy, see.
- You've got a lot
of Christmas presents.

1:08:17.261 --> 1:08:18.795
Watching
Christmas stuff.

1:09:31.835 --> 1:09:34.037
Initially, like, when I
initially saw you fight

1:09:34.070 --> 1:09:35.905
I saw you
fight Anacortes.

1:09:35.939 --> 1:09:37.207
- Right.
- That was when the first
time I saw you fight.

1:09:37.241 --> 1:09:39.709
- Yeah.
- And I was like,
"Wow, Clayton Hoy!"

1:09:39.743 --> 1:09:41.945
And I talked to Charlie,
I was, like, listen,
I really want to fight.

1:09:41.978 --> 1:09:44.614
He's, like, going, "Why?"
I go, "He just
looks ex -- he's.."

1:09:44.648 --> 1:09:46.416
- You're like,
look exciting.
- Yeah.

1:09:46.450 --> 1:09:48.218
You're like an extreme
exciting fight.

1:09:48.252 --> 1:09:49.619
- So, that's why
I really wanted to play.
- Yeah.

1:09:49.653 --> 1:09:51.154
That's
a fighter's mindset.

1:09:51.187 --> 1:09:52.822
That's not like, I'm
going to take that fight

1:09:52.856 --> 1:09:54.658
because I know I can
beat that dude up.

1:09:54.691 --> 1:09:56.092
It's like,
I'm going to take
that fight

1:09:56.125 --> 1:09:57.927
because that's going
to be a fuckin' fight.

1:09:57.961 --> 1:10:00.864
Oh, yeah, 'cause, like,
all my training
that I've been doing

1:10:00.897 --> 1:10:03.233
for the last, like, years
has been about you.

1:10:03.267 --> 1:10:04.668
I was like, going,
what can I do to train

1:10:04.701 --> 1:10:06.135
to -- to be better
at this?

1:10:06.169 --> 1:10:07.571
Well, we can still
make it happen.

1:10:07.604 --> 1:10:09.506
- I know, that's..
- I'm here right now.

1:10:09.539 --> 1:10:10.974
- I'm here
for a few months.

1:10:11.007 --> 1:10:12.342
Yeah.

1:10:12.376 --> 1:10:14.077
And I'm pretty
flexible right now.

1:10:14.110 --> 1:10:16.846
- And everything I have
fits in the duffel bag.

1:10:16.880 --> 1:10:18.715
Yeah, all my shit
is down in Vegas

1:10:18.748 --> 1:10:21.050
and I'm just kinda
wingin' it right now.

1:10:21.084 --> 1:10:22.752
- Uh..

1:10:22.786 --> 1:10:24.220
Uh, temporarily.

1:10:24.254 --> 1:10:26.556
So, Jessica and I
are splitting up.

1:10:26.590 --> 1:10:28.124
- Yeah, I know.

1:10:28.157 --> 1:10:29.793
- Um..
- If you don't mind
me asking.

1:10:29.826 --> 1:10:33.563
Yeah, it's...
it's nothing like

1:10:33.597 --> 1:10:35.064
there's not one thing
that really did it

1:10:35.098 --> 1:10:38.368
but at this point,
she just doesn't
really want me anymore.

1:10:40.169 --> 1:10:41.405
- Yeah, it's weird, man.
- Wow.

1:10:41.438 --> 1:10:42.906
It's like I hit
a reset button on my life.

1:10:42.939 --> 1:10:45.875
I showed up here,
I had an expired license.

1:10:45.909 --> 1:10:49.279
- I didn't have insurance.
I didn't have a phone.
- That's crazy.

1:10:49.313 --> 1:10:51.748
I didn't have any money
in a bank account
that I could use.

1:10:51.781 --> 1:10:52.882
- 'Cause it's shared.
- Yeah.

1:10:52.916 --> 1:10:56.219
Yeah, so, I, uh,
so, I just have some cash

1:10:56.252 --> 1:10:59.222
and some clothes
that smell like
fish and diesel.

1:10:59.255 --> 1:11:00.824
So, I went out.
The onl..

1:11:00.857 --> 1:11:03.026
The clothes I'm wearing,
they're like my
only new clothes

1:11:03.059 --> 1:11:04.461
that are acceptable
to be in public.

1:11:04.494 --> 1:11:06.062
Bought some
new shoes today.

1:11:06.095 --> 1:11:08.665
And, uh, yeah.

1:11:08.698 --> 1:11:11.134
Uh, it is, it's,
it's just weird
how you see

1:11:11.167 --> 1:11:12.302
when you say
these things to me

1:11:12.336 --> 1:11:15.739
because in my head,
I picture

1:11:15.772 --> 1:11:18.041
Clayton Hoy,
like a different life.

1:11:18.074 --> 1:11:19.976
- Yeah.
- Like, you know,
just, like..

1:11:20.009 --> 1:11:22.646
I -- I always pictured
like, you know..

1:11:22.679 --> 1:11:24.147
...just on top
of the world.

1:11:24.180 --> 1:11:25.815
Yeah.

1:11:25.849 --> 1:11:28.585
- You know, like --
- I just, I just feel like
a kid still, man.

1:11:32.389 --> 1:11:33.657
Yeah.

1:11:36.059 --> 1:11:38.728
I've had, like, a lot of,
like, stuff going on,
like, like yourself..

1:11:38.762 --> 1:11:40.196
- Yeah.
- With, like,
just life and stuff.

1:11:40.229 --> 1:11:43.367
With the kids,
and with the wife.
With the job.

1:11:43.400 --> 1:11:46.570
And I, one thing I kept
tellin' myself was, like

1:11:46.603 --> 1:11:48.805
I've been wondering
a lot about, was, like..

1:11:48.838 --> 1:11:51.975
What's the most
important thing to me?
You know what I mean?

1:11:52.008 --> 1:11:54.611
I was able to go
and step into the cage
with you once.

1:11:54.644 --> 1:11:56.746
Maybe sometime
in the future,
I do it again.

1:11:56.780 --> 1:11:59.749
Right now, because
of my kids, because of
the wife right now..

1:11:59.783 --> 1:12:01.317
- Just your situation.
- I can't do it
right now.

1:12:01.351 --> 1:12:02.719
Yeah.
No, man, I get it.

1:12:02.752 --> 1:12:04.187
So, now, I gotta
focus on them

1:12:04.220 --> 1:12:05.321
versus anything else
right now.

1:12:05.355 --> 1:12:07.557
Yeah, and that's what
you should do.

1:12:07.591 --> 1:12:09.092
- You know, it really is..
- It sucks.

1:12:09.125 --> 1:12:11.861
It sucks, but that's
the right thing to do.

1:12:11.895 --> 1:12:14.330
I know,
that's what I'm saying,
like, it's hard to say..

1:12:14.364 --> 1:12:17.166
Like, right now,
when do you know
when you're done?

1:12:18.201 --> 1:12:20.737
Yeah.
Yeah.

1:12:20.770 --> 1:12:22.672
Yeah, when do you know
when, like, yeah..

1:12:22.706 --> 1:12:23.840
I, I can tell people
all the time.

1:12:23.873 --> 1:12:25.609
How do you,
how do you call it?

1:12:30.246 --> 1:12:31.548
- Alright.
- Cheers, man!

1:12:54.871 --> 1:12:56.139
Yeah.

1:13:00.076 --> 1:13:01.344
I turned it down.

1:13:04.013 --> 1:13:05.281
You're happy for that?

1:13:07.517 --> 1:13:08.952
What's Delanee doin'?

1:13:33.743 --> 1:13:36.312
For now, we're just
gonna work on ones.
So, here..

1:13:36.345 --> 1:13:38.214
Chin. Both hands up.

1:13:38.247 --> 1:13:40.950
Go one.
One. One.

1:13:40.984 --> 1:13:42.919
Your power's actually
comin' from your front.

1:13:42.952 --> 1:13:45.789
Your front is what,
it's all your power,
that's why in a fight

1:13:45.822 --> 1:13:48.091
people will do this
and kick the front leg.

1:13:48.124 --> 1:13:50.326
Because if they keep
kicking your front leg

1:13:50.359 --> 1:13:52.128
then, your power
goes away.

1:13:57.100 --> 1:13:59.469
You wanna move,
or you wanna
keep flowin'?

1:13:59.503 --> 1:14:01.938
When I first started,
I was like,
a Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robot.

1:14:01.971 --> 1:14:04.608
Joe must break.

1:14:04.641 --> 1:14:07.276
That's all you need,
it's all about being
in control, relaxed.

1:14:07.310 --> 1:14:10.747
There you go!
There you go!
Get that.. Yeah, yeah!

1:14:10.780 --> 1:14:13.149
- Go, go, go, go.
- Keep going. Nice job.

1:14:13.182 --> 1:14:14.684
- Nice job, good job.
- Good job.

1:14:14.718 --> 1:14:15.885
- Good job, guys.
- Good job.

1:14:24.460 --> 1:14:25.629
Go.

1:14:26.630 --> 1:14:27.931
- Hi, daddy.
- Hello.

1:14:29.933 --> 1:14:31.701
- Bye, girls.
- Bye.

1:14:33.169 --> 1:14:36.205
- No more, no more.
- Come on, Mia.

1:14:36.239 --> 1:14:37.473
No more.

1:14:38.441 --> 1:14:39.876
Get her!
Ram into her.

1:14:42.111 --> 1:14:43.647
- No slapping!
- Ow.

1:14:49.085 --> 1:14:50.720
Ugh, come on, Mia!

1:14:50.754 --> 1:14:52.388
And don't ever give up!

1:14:58.194 --> 1:14:59.729
I got you gloves.

1:14:59.763 --> 1:15:02.265
- These gloves
are my gloves?
- Yeah.

1:15:02.298 --> 1:15:03.667
Yay!

1:15:03.700 --> 1:15:05.301
- Wait, these are
only, like, practice?

1:15:05.334 --> 1:15:07.136
- Yep.
- Okay.

1:15:07.170 --> 1:15:09.005
And then, like,
the real ones
are, like, only..

1:15:09.038 --> 1:15:10.940
Small ones, yeah,
so, when you get
better at punchin'

1:15:10.974 --> 1:15:12.108
I'll get you
the other ones.

1:15:12.141 --> 1:15:13.142
Okay.

1:15:15.044 --> 1:15:16.479
So, you've been saying
how you want
to train, right?

1:15:16.512 --> 1:15:17.781
Yeah.

1:15:18.848 --> 1:15:20.516
John, Dakota.

1:15:21.618 --> 1:15:23.019
Sarah.

1:15:23.052 --> 1:15:24.520
There you go.
You'll need some tape.

1:15:39.302 --> 1:15:40.704
Bring it up.

1:15:42.572 --> 1:15:43.840
Perfect.

1:15:45.274 --> 1:15:46.375
Two more.

1:15:46.409 --> 1:15:47.877
Here, right there.

1:15:47.911 --> 1:15:50.146
Because now,
and, you know,
whenever you're fighting

1:15:50.179 --> 1:15:52.481
you're always
going to bring
your shoulders up.

1:15:52.515 --> 1:15:55.151
And your chin down.
Good job.

1:15:55.184 --> 1:15:57.854
Okay, so here,
I'm gonna come here.

1:15:57.887 --> 1:15:59.455
Out, and right back.

1:16:01.090 --> 1:16:03.760
Cool.
Out, and right back.

1:16:06.896 --> 1:16:10.634
One, and as I
come back, two.

1:18:59.068 --> 1:19:01.170
* This world

1:19:03.139 --> 1:19:05.708

1:19:05.741 --> 1:19:07.710
* Is all in my hands

1:19:07.743 --> 1:19:10.313
* Is all in my hands

1:19:10.346 --> 1:19:12.381
* This world

1:19:13.316 --> 1:19:15.184
* Is all in my hands

1:19:15.218 --> 1:19:17.520
* Is all in my hands

1:19:17.553 --> 1:19:20.656
* This world

1:19:20.689 --> 1:19:23.026
* Is all in my hands

1:19:23.059 --> 1:19:25.061
* Is all in my hands

1:19:57.426 --> 1:19:59.295
* This world

1:20:00.830 --> 1:20:03.132
* Stay close

1:20:04.968 --> 1:20:06.802
* This world

1:20:12.575 --> 1:20:14.377
* This world

1:20:17.713 --> 1:20:19.315
* Stay close *
