WEBVTT

00:01.968 --> 00:04.103
the Fuller and Fuller
line of skin care products.

00:04.105 --> 00:05.671
Here at the Quality Shopping Channel,

00:05.673 --> 00:07.825
your pitch will be seen
by millions of Americans,

00:07.827 --> 00:10.976
a tiny fraction of whom will be sober
and not have frozen credit cards.

00:10.978 --> 00:12.344
Well, we just launched
the product three months ago,

00:12.346 --> 00:13.679
so this is huge for us.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.581
So after some internal discussion,

00:15.583 --> 00:18.451
we've decided that we would
like Allison to do the honor

00:18.453 --> 00:19.418
of the on-air presentation.

00:19.420 --> 00:20.619
What? Me?

00:20.621 --> 00:21.987
What? Her?

00:21.989 --> 00:23.389
Nothing personal, Marv, we've just found

00:23.391 --> 00:25.324
that women tend to sell
more to our demographic.

00:25.326 --> 00:26.692
Also she's younger.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.194
And more attractive.

00:28.196 --> 00:29.695
And I'd just love for you to jump in

00:29.697 --> 00:31.497
and say you get it before
I really insult you.

00:31.499 --> 00:33.399
Oh, I get it. It's a no-brainer.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.267
- What do you say?
- I don't know, Dad.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.136
If you don't do it, we're
gonna have to put your product on

00:37.138 --> 00:39.171
at 5:00 a.m. in between the duck calls

00:39.173 --> 00:40.906
and the novelty golf
clubs you can pee in.

00:40.908 --> 00:43.909
This is a “taking our
hard work to the next leve”"

00:43.911 --> 00:46.178
sort of opportunity, you understand that.

00:46.180 --> 00:48.247
Talking about a level
where we don't have to work.

00:48.249 --> 00:50.316
Talking about Jessica Alba money.

00:50.318 --> 00:53.519
Oh, uh... okay.

00:53.521 --> 00:54.587
That's my girl.

00:54.589 --> 00:56.388
- Yeah, okay.
- All right.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.491
Listen, do you have any more
of those putters you can pee in?

00:58.493 --> 01:00.159
'Cause I have a guy in my foursome...

01:00.161 --> 01:01.460
bladder of a pregnant lady.

01:01.462 --> 01:03.162
- Is that Brad?
- Yeah, it's Brad.

01:03.164 --> 01:05.096
Ah, there's my top dog, huh?

01:05.099 --> 01:06.832
- Hey.
- How's it going?

01:06.834 --> 01:10.236
We getting any,
uh... bites on this place?

01:10.238 --> 01:11.570
Oh yeah, definite...

01:11.572 --> 01:13.072
Uh, some nibbles, for sure.

01:13.074 --> 01:14.573
Oof.

01:14.575 --> 01:17.343
Little late to be seeing
more cookies than plate, isn't it?

01:17.345 --> 01:19.011
Those are not oatmeal-raisin, are they?

01:19.013 --> 01:20.746
Come on, Trav, not selling condos.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.448
You're staring down a
plate of chocolate chucks there.

01:22.450 --> 01:23.345
Well done.

01:23.347 --> 01:25.918
Look, I realize it is no
easy task selling a house

01:25.920 --> 01:27.720
where people have been so recently

01:27.722 --> 01:29.588
and, God, just brutally murdered.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.690
Don't you worry, I've
been fending off the news vans.

01:31.692 --> 01:33.192
They have come by several times.

01:33.194 --> 01:34.693
That's why I trusted
you with this listing.

01:34.695 --> 01:35.728
I knew if anybody was gonna be able

01:35.730 --> 01:37.196
to sell the murder house,

01:37.198 --> 01:39.198
- it was gonna be my top dog.
- Oh, definitely.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.200
But listen, if you can't handle it...

01:41.202 --> 01:43.269
Hey, I can handle it, and
don't you worry about it.

01:43.271 --> 01:45.404
I'm gonna kill it, even more
than the previous owners did.

01:45.406 --> 01:48.541
Okay, that's a little
dark for an open house.

01:48.543 --> 01:51.510
Uh... they're just... checking
out the front yard.

01:51.512 --> 01:52.811
That's all new landscaping.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.647
And unrestricted
street parking, by the way.

01:54.649 --> 01:56.315
Except for Tuesdays and Thursdays.

01:56.317 --> 01:58.117
And evenings can be a little tricky.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.386
Aw.

02:00.388 --> 02:02.588
Look at you, working away.

02:02.590 --> 02:05.090
Hey, Amy, you know that rope-like thing

02:05.092 --> 02:07.026
on the side of your
robe there? It's a belt.

02:07.028 --> 02:08.761
Oh, well, I prefer to use it like this.

02:08.763 --> 02:11.325
Boom, chicka-chicka, boom, chicka, wow.

02:11.584 --> 02:13.332
Amy, cinch it.

02:13.334 --> 02:14.767
Oh, you humans are so touchy

02:14.769 --> 02:16.502
about nudity, my goodness.

02:16.504 --> 02:17.736
You want to see something crazy?

02:17.738 --> 02:19.004
You should see my true form.

02:19.006 --> 02:21.006
It'll melt your face off.

02:21.008 --> 02:23.209
So, where have you been this morning?

02:23.211 --> 02:25.444
I had to do the run-through
for that QSC thing.

02:25.446 --> 02:28.147
It turns out they want me to
present instead of my dad.

02:28.149 --> 02:29.615
Oh, well, that's fantastic.

02:29.617 --> 02:30.849
You're a natural.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.718
I could watch your face for hours.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.220
No, I am not a natural.

02:34.222 --> 02:35.988
I have only been on camera twice before,

02:35.990 --> 02:39.425
and both times I... underperformed.

02:39.427 --> 02:41.694
Do you need me to repeat the question?

02:42.830 --> 02:43.862
False.

02:43.864 --> 02:44.830
Rwanda!

02:44.832 --> 02:46.131
Pass.

02:47.335 --> 02:48.806
Well, moving on to our next student

02:48.807 --> 02:51.170
and see if he can tell us
the answer to the question,

02:51.172 --> 02:52.605
“What is your name”"

02:52.607 --> 02:54.506
With us to talk about sun safety

02:54.508 --> 02:57.109
is dermatologist Dr. Allison Fuller.

02:58.446 --> 02:59.645
Sun.

02:59.647 --> 03:00.679
Lots of fun.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.715
Safe!

03:02.717 --> 03:05.251
Back to you, Rachel.

03:05.253 --> 03:06.703
Now, if you're wondering

03:06.728 --> 03:08.153
- where I was.
- I wasn't.

03:08.155 --> 03:10.122
For the quiz show, I was in Kansas City.

03:10.124 --> 03:12.725
It was an angel convention. Bad timing.

03:12.727 --> 03:14.793
Super-fun. We lit a car on fire.

03:14.795 --> 03:16.228
Oh, and the morning show?

03:16.230 --> 03:17.596
Oh, again I was in Kansas City

03:17.598 --> 03:18.864
because the Royals were in the playoffs.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.532
Against the Angels.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.868
Yay Royals, boo Angels.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.603
Not what you would have thought, right?

03:24.605 --> 03:26.805
We also lit a car on fire.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.440
This is gonna be a disaster.

03:28.442 --> 03:29.408
No, it's not, honey.

03:29.410 --> 03:30.409
You're gonna do great.

03:30.411 --> 03:31.777
And you know how I know that?

03:31.779 --> 03:33.646
Because you are great.

03:33.648 --> 03:35.180
Do you have any practical
tips to help me

03:35.182 --> 03:36.348
with this presentation?

03:36.350 --> 03:38.584
Yes, I do, I do.

03:38.586 --> 03:40.686
Turn those negatives into positives,

03:40.688 --> 03:43.255
those frowns upside down,

03:43.257 --> 03:44.189
and when life gives you...

03:44.191 --> 03:45.724
Do not say “lemons.”

03:45.726 --> 03:48.694
...oranges, make lemonade.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.296
Hmm.

03:53.768 --> 03:55.434
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, Brad.

03:55.436 --> 03:58.671
Hi. Thought I'd stop by after
the open house, say hi.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.707
Tops.

04:01.709 --> 04:02.841
Sweet kicks, dude.

04:02.843 --> 04:04.410
Oh.

04:04.412 --> 04:05.644
You noticed.

04:05.646 --> 04:06.679
New Jordan Dub Zeros.

04:06.681 --> 04:08.180
Got 'em for a steal, only four hundy.

04:08.182 --> 04:09.548
And a three-hour wait in line.

04:09.550 --> 04:11.817
- Ugh, doesn't seem worth it.
- Totally worth it.

04:11.819 --> 04:13.652
I needed a little pick-me-up.

04:13.654 --> 04:14.920
Been bummed.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.422
I haven't been able to
sell the murder house.

04:16.423 --> 04:17.822
Maybe you should tie them?

04:17.825 --> 04:19.291
What?! No.

04:19.293 --> 04:20.559
That's not how you wear them.

04:21.499 --> 04:22.628
- Oh, bee, Brad.
- What?

04:22.630 --> 04:24.563
A, Allison. Ooh, this is a fun game.

04:24.565 --> 04:25.931
- Watch out!
- No, it's fine.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.166
I avoid them, they avoid me.

04:27.168 --> 04:28.434
You know you are highly allergic.

04:28.436 --> 04:29.601
You could die.

04:29.603 --> 04:30.969
Go get your EpiPen.
Where is your EpiPen?

04:30.971 --> 04:32.705
- It's in the car.
- Well, get it.

04:32.707 --> 04:34.640
Uh, okay, okay.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.709
Allison, be careful of that bee.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.144
No.

04:39.146 --> 04:41.847
Oh, sweet mercy, no.

04:41.849 --> 04:43.382
What? It's just a bee.

04:43.384 --> 04:44.616
No, no, no, no, Allison.

04:44.618 --> 04:45.918
No, no, no, no, no.

04:45.920 --> 04:47.219
It's not “just a bee”"

04:47.221 --> 04:48.387
Oh, is it a magic bee?

04:48.389 --> 04:50.456
This bee is Brad's guardian angel.

04:50.458 --> 04:52.024
Frank.

04:52.026 --> 04:53.715
Angels come in different forms,

04:53.849 --> 04:56.362
based on the type of guidance
each human needs.

04:56.364 --> 04:57.692
Does somebody up there
think I need to drink more?

04:57.693 --> 04:59.030
'Cause that's the
guidance I'm getting.

04:59.055 --> 05:00.910
Oh, Allison, relax. Have a glass of wine.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.869
Look, I am the perfect
guardian angel for you.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.804
My unwavering positivity

05:05.806 --> 05:07.840
balances out your inner negative voice.

05:07.842 --> 05:09.842
As a bee that Brad is allergic to,

05:09.844 --> 05:11.944
Frank was the perfect guardian angel.

05:11.946 --> 05:13.278
He was like a shock collar

05:13.280 --> 05:15.314
that stopped Brad
from doing stupid things.

05:15.316 --> 05:17.015
Brad's gonna be fine.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.017
Ow! I fell off the porch!

05:19.019 --> 05:19.918
Seriously?

05:19.920 --> 05:21.854
Brad, are you okay?

05:21.856 --> 05:23.322
Yeah, I just twisted my ankle.

05:23.324 --> 05:25.691
Nope, I scuffed my Jordans!

05:27.460 --> 05:30.538
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

05:33.173 --> 05:35.255
I still can't believe you assassinated

05:35.257 --> 05:36.456
Brad's guardian angel.

05:36.458 --> 05:38.591
Stop calling me an assassin.

05:38.593 --> 05:40.927
Now I'm gonna have to
pull double duty... angel rules.

05:40.929 --> 05:43.296
If your human kills another
human's angel,

05:43.298 --> 05:45.131
you have to step up and be the surrogate

05:45.133 --> 05:46.966
until that angel gets a new body.

05:46.968 --> 05:49.402
Ah, and what is the wait time
on new angel bodies these days?

05:49.404 --> 05:51.437
Oh, for a bee, probably a week.

05:51.439 --> 05:53.273
A whale, two days.

05:53.275 --> 05:54.540
You make sense out of it.

05:54.542 --> 05:56.376
I'm done trying to figure out corporate.

05:56.378 --> 05:58.444
Listen, while Frank is being refitted,

05:58.446 --> 06:01.281
I'm gonna be slammed, angeling
both you and Brad.

06:01.283 --> 06:04.183
Wow, you're gonna be working
two pretend jobs?

06:04.185 --> 06:06.152
They're gonna be so
impressed at the pretend bank

06:06.154 --> 06:07.464
when you're cashing those

06:07.489 --> 06:09.088
- pretend checks.
- Are you done?

06:09.090 --> 06:12.058
Look, I am just super-busy preparing
for this QSC thing,

06:12.060 --> 06:14.060
so if you want to spend more
time with Brad, great.

06:14.062 --> 06:15.094
Don't sleep with him.

06:15.096 --> 06:16.963
Oh, I can't make any promises.

06:16.965 --> 06:18.531
People do weird
things on heavy painkillers.

06:18.533 --> 06:19.999
I only gave him aspirin.

06:20.001 --> 06:21.601
I'm not talking about Brad.

06:21.603 --> 06:23.036
I'm talking about me.

06:24.272 --> 06:26.105
I'm on heavy painkillers.

06:26.107 --> 06:28.107
This sucks. How am I supposed
to get to my open house

06:28.109 --> 06:29.109
with an injury like this?

06:29.110 --> 06:30.576
I got to put out food.

06:30.578 --> 06:32.345
I got to tell people to
help themselves to said food.

06:32.347 --> 06:34.113
Yeah, I guess I could probably
do those, actually.

06:34.115 --> 06:37.183
Well, of course you can, because
I will be helping you.

06:37.185 --> 06:39.152
Oh, would you? That would be great.

06:39.154 --> 06:42.221
I'll be watching over
you, get you through problems...

06:42.223 --> 06:44.557
Man, she's like my
own little guardian angel.

06:44.559 --> 06:47.193
Whoa, let the record show I
did not say that.

06:48.763 --> 06:50.196
This neighborhood, by
the way, is becoming

06:50.198 --> 06:51.998
one of the... one of the hottest in L.A.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.367
No, it really is an incredible house.

06:54.369 --> 06:56.469
So, about

06:56.471 --> 06:58.204
- the murders.
- The murders.

06:58.206 --> 07:00.139
Yeah. I-I knew you
guys might ask about that.

07:00.141 --> 07:02.175
That's... which is great,
because I... I don't know

07:02.177 --> 07:04.310
if you guys know this... it
actually wasn't a murder.

07:04.312 --> 07:05.578
- It wasn't?
- No.

07:05.580 --> 07:07.313
- What a relief.
- Yeah.

07:07.315 --> 07:09.282
It was murder-suicide.

07:09.284 --> 07:13.252
And the kids were in their
20s, so it actually wasn't that sad.

07:13.254 --> 07:16.489
Okay, well, we'll talk about it.

07:22.731 --> 07:24.564
I'm never gonna sell this house.

07:24.566 --> 07:26.232
Hey, you stop that. You're
gonna do great.

07:26.234 --> 07:27.467
You know how I know?

07:27.469 --> 07:29.102
You are great.

07:29.104 --> 07:30.236
You really think so?

07:30.238 --> 07:31.537
Yeah, you're motivated.

07:31.539 --> 07:33.172
You're determined.

07:33.174 --> 07:34.674
Your eyes are both warm and beady.

07:34.676 --> 07:36.442
Which is the perfect combination.

07:36.444 --> 07:38.945
You just got to grab the bull
by the horns and make lemonade.

07:38.947 --> 07:41.681
- That is amazing advice.
- Really?

07:41.683 --> 07:43.516
It's “amazing” advice?

07:43.518 --> 07:45.051
Yeah, I am great.

07:45.053 --> 07:46.919
I'm the best real estate
agent I know.

07:46.921 --> 07:48.354
I just needed you to remind me of that.

07:48.356 --> 07:50.189
You could sell this
house with your eyes closed

07:50.191 --> 07:51.491
and the bodies still in it.

07:51.493 --> 07:54.026
God, I love your
relentless unearned optimism.

07:56.564 --> 07:59.165
Ooh, pardon, folks, I got to
get to the mortgage store

07:59.167 --> 08:01.667
so I can buy this amazing house.

08:01.669 --> 08:03.102
Hey, sweetie.

08:03.104 --> 08:05.037
- How's the presentation going?
- Do you know

08:05.039 --> 08:06.639
how many videos there are of
people messing up on QSC?

08:06.641 --> 08:08.608
“QSC Panic Attack.”

08:08.610 --> 08:10.009
“QSC Butter Slip.”

08:10.011 --> 08:11.377
“QSC Hand-Crank Pasta
Maker Zipper Fiasco.”

08:11.379 --> 08:12.645
There must be a thousand of them.

08:12.647 --> 08:15.448
Well, let's not make it 1,001, hmm?

08:15.450 --> 08:17.316
Would you like some
constructive criticism?

08:17.318 --> 08:18.651
Oh, my God, yes.

08:18.653 --> 08:21.120
You tend to play with
your hair, don't do it.

08:21.122 --> 08:24.090
Your voice gets a
little screechy, knock it off.

08:24.092 --> 08:26.659
Also, I printed this out
so you wouldn't get nervous.

08:26.661 --> 08:29.796
“Six tips to overcome your
fear of speaking on camera.”

08:29.798 --> 08:31.397
Finally, some practical advice.

08:31.399 --> 08:32.799
Right?

08:32.801 --> 08:34.700
Hey, you want six real tips

08:34.702 --> 08:36.769
to overcome your fear
of speaking on camera?

08:36.770 --> 08:40.773
You're. Going. To. Do. Great.

08:40.775 --> 08:42.842
Allison.

08:42.844 --> 08:44.310
Is it just me, or does that advice have

08:44.312 --> 08:45.678
absolutely no substance to it?

08:45.680 --> 08:47.313
It's kind of her thing.

08:47.315 --> 08:48.181
We got this.

08:48.183 --> 08:51.684
Oh, you and your “dad” got this?

08:51.686 --> 08:53.219
Why are you using air quotes for “dad”?

08:53.221 --> 08:54.287
He is my dad.

08:54.289 --> 08:55.555
And the cocreator of the product.

08:55.557 --> 08:56.956
Not just “a friend.”

08:56.958 --> 08:58.458
And why are you using air quotes?

08:58.460 --> 09:01.594
Your role in my daughter's
life is muddy at best.

09:01.596 --> 09:03.162
Snap.

09:03.164 --> 09:04.430
Check on you later.

09:08.069 --> 09:10.136
Oh, it'd be much easier to double-angel

09:10.138 --> 09:11.637
if I could fly like a bee.

09:11.639 --> 09:13.506
Or had a driver's license.

09:13.508 --> 09:15.775
Ugh, damn you, DUI.

09:17.145 --> 09:19.145
I heard a man killed his
wife and her lover here.

09:19.147 --> 09:20.379
Is that true?

09:20.381 --> 09:21.848
Do you mean, is this house so awesome

09:21.850 --> 09:23.649
that it incites great passion,

09:23.651 --> 09:25.751
or that this house is so impressive

09:25.753 --> 09:27.420
that you could take on a lover?

09:27.422 --> 09:29.088
Yeah.

09:29.090 --> 09:30.323
Why don't you think about it?

09:30.325 --> 09:31.824
Don't take too long, though.

09:31.826 --> 09:33.826
I think, if this house
has taught us anything,

09:33.828 --> 09:35.261
it's that life is so short.

09:35.263 --> 09:36.829
Also I have three
other offers on the table,

09:36.831 --> 09:38.197
and one of them is all cash.

09:38.199 --> 09:39.365
Make that two all cash.

09:39.367 --> 09:40.900
I look forward to your application.

09:42.103 --> 09:43.402
- How's it going?
- We did it.

09:43.404 --> 09:45.271
“We,” I love the sound of that.

09:45.273 --> 09:47.073
I turned negatives into
positives, just like you said.

09:47.075 --> 09:48.508
I could not have done this without you.

09:48.510 --> 09:51.544
Oh, I've never had this
kind of feedback before.

09:52.847 --> 09:54.547
Bradley Middle Name Fuller,

09:54.549 --> 09:56.582
you just sold an unsellable,
most likely haunted house.

09:56.584 --> 09:58.484
- What are you gonna do next?
- Uh...

09:58.486 --> 09:59.719
Well, actually I should probably

09:59.721 --> 10:00.686
use the commission to pay off some debt.

10:00.688 --> 10:02.221
- Or?
- Or, uh...

10:02.223 --> 10:05.157
treat myself to something
nice as a reward?

10:05.159 --> 10:07.226
Oh, you're an excellent student.

10:07.228 --> 10:10.162
Wow, you sound like none of my teachers.

10:10.164 --> 10:12.465
Hey, what's the emergency?

10:12.467 --> 10:15.701
- Oh, there's no emergency.
- You texted me to meet you here, 911.

10:15.703 --> 10:18.804
That's 'cause I wanted you to
move fast, like a Porsche 911.

10:18.806 --> 10:21.707
So you could see the most
beautiful person in the world

10:21.709 --> 10:24.210
- on a wall of TVs.
- Okay, why am I here?

10:24.212 --> 10:27.179
Well, you are here to
receive a booster shot

10:27.181 --> 10:30.583
of Amy positivity before
you catch “negatitus C.”

10:30.585 --> 10:31.884
And I'm also here for batteries.

10:31.886 --> 10:33.252
I don't need a cheerleader.

10:33.254 --> 10:34.387
Oh, you obviously haven't

10:34.389 --> 10:35.688
seen Friday Night Lights.

10:35.690 --> 10:37.056
Oh, is it good? I heard it's good.

10:37.058 --> 10:38.724
Oh, my God, so good. Skip season two.

10:38.726 --> 10:40.293
Otherwise, amazing.

10:40.295 --> 10:41.727
What I need is to be
home practicing so that

10:41.729 --> 10:43.596
I don't get nervous and screw up.

10:43.598 --> 10:45.298
Well, I've got a fix for that...
if you're nervous standing

10:45.300 --> 10:47.233
in front of the audience,
just picture them naked.

10:47.235 --> 10:48.901
That's a bit of a
complete and total cliché.

10:48.903 --> 10:50.369
Yeah, but it actually works,

10:50.371 --> 10:52.738
because you humans are so
weird around nakedness.

10:52.740 --> 10:55.308
It took me so long to
understand your rules.

10:55.310 --> 10:57.743
You can see my elbow, but
you can't see my boob.

10:57.745 --> 10:59.478
You can see my forehead, but
you can't see my butt crack.

10:59.480 --> 11:00.680
It doesn't make any sense.

11:00.682 --> 11:02.815
Brad, what are you doing here?

11:02.817 --> 11:06.519
Top dog deserves top TV and this awesome

11:06.521 --> 11:07.687
Auto-Tune microphone.

11:12.427 --> 11:13.492
I'm already bored with it.

11:13.494 --> 11:15.361
I'm gonna go grab some 3-D glasses.

11:15.363 --> 11:17.263
Okay, look, I have a huge day tomorrow,

11:17.265 --> 11:18.631
so if you could please
just stay out of my way

11:18.633 --> 11:20.166
until this QSC thing is over.

11:20.168 --> 11:21.601
“Stay out of your way”...
is that how you see this?

11:21.603 --> 11:23.336
Because I'm, like, busting my butt

11:23.338 --> 11:25.504
pulling double duty all day here.

11:25.506 --> 11:27.473
Yeah, well, your relentless
enthusiasm and positivity

11:27.475 --> 11:28.808
is actually bumming me
out. I need some practical help.

11:28.810 --> 11:30.276
Like what your “dad” gives you?

11:30.278 --> 11:32.211
Why are you air-quoting
my dad? He is my dad.

11:32.213 --> 11:34.246
Well, maybe I should just focus on Brad.

11:34.248 --> 11:35.915
He's the only one who seems to
be receptive to my guidance.

11:35.917 --> 11:37.783
Well, maybe he's receptive
to your guidance because

11:37.785 --> 11:39.251
you haven't told him that you're
a 4,000-year-old angel.

11:39.253 --> 11:42.388
I am a 3,700-year-old angel, Allison.

11:42.390 --> 11:43.990
You know that I'm touchy about my age.

11:43.992 --> 11:45.891
Okay, and you know what?

11:45.893 --> 11:47.460
If you're refusing angeling
for this week,

11:47.462 --> 11:49.462
- I need you to sign a release.
- It's blank.

11:49.464 --> 11:52.198
Aw, crap, I forgot humans can't
see the color thurple.

11:52.200 --> 11:54.634
Listen, it's just a standard release.

11:54.636 --> 11:57.503
Obviously, there's a clause that
states if you're in danger

11:57.505 --> 12:00.306
of grave bodily harm or about
to date a member of a jam band,

12:00.308 --> 12:02.508
I'll tag back in.

12:02.510 --> 12:04.644
There you go.

12:04.646 --> 12:06.912
Have a great week.

12:14.055 --> 12:16.088
No, he's right. It does get old fast.

12:19.549 --> 12:21.530
Thank you for coming by
to help me out with this.

12:21.532 --> 12:23.698
Oh, please, I'd do anything
for my daughter,

12:23.700 --> 12:26.134
who holds our future in her hands.

12:26.136 --> 12:28.670
Look, I know I really need
to nail this, so I will take

12:28.672 --> 12:30.505
all the constructive criticism I can get.

12:30.507 --> 12:31.339
That's my girl.

12:31.341 --> 12:32.574
So let's start with

12:32.576 --> 12:34.176
your glaring and obvious inability

12:34.178 --> 12:35.577
to focus live on air.

12:35.579 --> 12:37.045
Show me what you got already.

12:37.047 --> 12:38.346
Great, okay.

12:38.348 --> 12:40.582
“Fuller and Fuller
Dermatology has created

12:40.584 --> 12:42.451
an innovative line of skin care...”

12:42.453 --> 12:44.085
Oh, oh, what is that?

12:44.087 --> 12:46.221
That's a boom mic. Just
checking your focus.

12:46.223 --> 12:48.457
These distractions
happen. You're on live TV, go.

12:48.459 --> 12:51.159
Okay, yeah, uh, “Fuller
and Fuller Dermatology

12:51.161 --> 12:54.162
has created an innovative
line of organic skin care...”

12:54.164 --> 12:55.664
There's a leak overhead. Ignore it.

12:55.666 --> 12:56.932
“Organic skin care products

12:56.934 --> 12:59.134
to treat a variety of skin cond...”

12:59.136 --> 13:00.635
Okay, seriously, nobody's
gonna be shaking the table.

13:00.637 --> 13:02.437
It's an earthquake... do you
duck and cover or keep going?

13:02.439 --> 13:04.673
- Duck and cover.
- Wrong! We got products to move!

13:04.675 --> 13:06.508
“Including acne,

13:06.510 --> 13:08.176
uh, eczema, psoriasis...”

13:08.178 --> 13:10.111
- Dad? Dad? Oh, no.
- Oh, honey.

13:10.113 --> 13:12.214
Oh... Oh, Dad, no, see,

13:12.216 --> 13:13.615
I don't know if this is a
part of the drill or real.

13:13.617 --> 13:16.117
Dad?

13:16.119 --> 13:17.719
Dad! Dad!

13:17.721 --> 13:20.188
Come on, a cameraman has a heart attack?

13:20.190 --> 13:21.990
You got to power through that.

13:21.992 --> 13:23.658
I'm a doctor. I took an oath.

13:23.660 --> 13:25.126
Fine, save the cameraman.

13:25.128 --> 13:26.628
But you got to drag
him onto the set first.

13:26.630 --> 13:27.629
It's good publicity.

13:27.631 --> 13:29.130
Okay, this is, this is a lot.

13:29.132 --> 13:30.499
- I think I need to take a break.
- Listen to me.

13:30.501 --> 13:32.100
- You're gonna do great.
- Oh?

13:32.102 --> 13:33.802
You know how I know you're
gonna do great?

13:33.804 --> 13:35.203
Because you have to.

13:35.205 --> 13:37.005
Get back over there, come on.

13:39.343 --> 13:40.342
Hey, Amy.

13:40.344 --> 13:41.510
Oh, hi.

13:41.512 --> 13:44.045
Uh, remind me how we know each other.

13:44.047 --> 13:46.181
- It's Allison, right?
- Ha-ha.

13:46.183 --> 13:48.812
Yeah, I'm off to the beach with Brad.

13:49.012 --> 13:51.019
You'd like him. Maybe we
could all grab coffee sometime.

13:51.021 --> 13:52.754
I really want you guys to be friends.

13:52.756 --> 13:54.456
- Doesn't he have work?
- He does.

13:54.458 --> 13:57.259
But I told him he was too
great to be shackled to his desk

13:57.261 --> 13:59.628
every day, and not only did
he agree, he thanked me.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.329
Unlike a certain someone I know.

14:01.331 --> 14:04.199
You know, my big QSC thing is today.

14:04.201 --> 14:05.567
Oh, oh.

14:05.569 --> 14:06.735
You're gonna...

14:06.737 --> 14:08.937
make me late for Brad.

14:11.174 --> 14:12.741
Good luck with your QSC thing.

14:12.743 --> 14:14.843
- What?
- What?

14:16.880 --> 14:19.648
You're a perfect human being, Allison.

14:19.650 --> 14:22.450
Nothing.

14:22.452 --> 14:23.952
Oh, man, I can't believe

14:23.954 --> 14:25.620
we're going to the beach
in the middle of the week.

14:25.622 --> 14:27.522
Allison would have an aneurysm.

14:27.524 --> 14:29.157
And that's not a good place to do it.

14:29.159 --> 14:30.525
Lifeguards aren't trained
to handle that.

14:30.527 --> 14:32.627
I, uh, may have spent a
few summers bay-watching.

14:32.629 --> 14:33.795
Oh.

14:33.797 --> 14:35.530
Hey, this isn't the beach.

14:35.532 --> 14:37.766
Oh, no, I got to pop in
here real quick and quit my job.

14:37.768 --> 14:40.302
All right, man. I'll wait here.

14:41.838 --> 14:44.639
Hey, Brad, hold up, man!

14:44.641 --> 14:48.176
All right, be confident
but not cocky, all right?

14:48.178 --> 14:49.444
Be quick but don't rush.

14:49.446 --> 14:51.413
Enunciate but be conversational.

14:51.415 --> 14:53.848
- Smile but don't force it.
- Okay, that's too many things.

14:53.850 --> 14:55.250
Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry.

14:55.252 --> 14:56.518
Have fun but take it seriously.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.620
Ah...

15:00.490 --> 15:03.692
Do you need me to repeat the question?

15:06.530 --> 15:07.696
False.

15:07.698 --> 15:09.431
Rwanda! Pass.

15:09.433 --> 15:12.233
Thank you, Rachel.

15:16.340 --> 15:18.173
Sun, lots of fun, safe.

15:18.175 --> 15:19.841
Back to you, Rachel.

15:19.843 --> 15:22.310
- It's you.
- Is everything okay?

15:22.312 --> 15:24.179
I think you're the reason
I get nervous on camera.

15:24.181 --> 15:26.448
- What do you mean?
- Well, we both like

15:26.450 --> 15:28.316
- constructive criticism.
- Love it.

15:28.318 --> 15:30.218
Yeah, and we tend to shy
away from positive reinforcement.

15:30.220 --> 15:31.586
- Because it's for wussies.
- Agreed.

15:31.588 --> 15:33.188
But when I see you off to the side,

15:33.190 --> 15:34.723
I get your voice inside my head.

15:34.725 --> 15:36.725
And I already have my
voice inside my head.

15:36.727 --> 15:38.760
And that is just a lot of
constructive criticism.

15:38.762 --> 15:40.228
Oh, my God, sweetie, no.

15:40.230 --> 15:42.330
I never meant to put
more pressure on you.

15:42.332 --> 15:44.299
I've just seen how you are in the past

15:44.301 --> 15:46.301
on camera and how tough it is for you.

15:46.303 --> 15:48.436
And as a dad, that's really
hard to watch you go through.

15:48.438 --> 15:49.494
I know it's coming from

15:49.519 --> 15:50.505
- a good place.
- It is.

15:50.507 --> 15:52.674
It's coming from love and a desperate
need to move product.

15:52.676 --> 15:54.042
- Dad?
- Right.

15:54.044 --> 15:55.577
You don't need me here right now.

15:55.579 --> 15:57.345
Okay.

15:57.347 --> 16:00.181
You're not gonna see this
face until you're done.

16:00.183 --> 16:01.850
You're gonna be great.

16:01.852 --> 16:03.785
Thanks, Dad.

16:03.787 --> 16:05.387
Hey, Brad, hey, hey!

16:05.389 --> 16:07.222
You-you said something
that was a little alarming.

16:07.224 --> 16:09.257
What-What-What's that?

16:09.259 --> 16:10.859
Yeah, I'm gonna quit my
job, like you told me.

16:10.861 --> 16:12.193
Cool beans, right?

16:12.195 --> 16:14.396
I know I never said, “Cool beans.”

16:14.398 --> 16:15.697
Yeah, remember, you told
me that I'm so great that

16:15.699 --> 16:17.198
I shouldn't be, like,
shackled to a desk.

16:17.200 --> 16:18.633
Oh, well, I meant that maybe

16:18.635 --> 16:20.301
you could take a longer lunch break

16:20.303 --> 16:21.469
or watch a video or
two in the handicap stall.

16:21.471 --> 16:23.338
Oh, I'm gonna do all that and more,

16:23.340 --> 16:24.773
'cause I'm gonna start my
own real estate company.

16:24.775 --> 16:26.508
What? When'd you
start thinking about this?

16:26.510 --> 16:28.343
You know, thank you for asking.

16:28.345 --> 16:30.945
Probably since I got into
real estate, really.

16:30.947 --> 16:32.380
Okay, staying positive.

16:32.382 --> 16:33.915
Um, do you have any kind of plan

16:33.917 --> 16:35.283
- for this whatsoever?
- Yes.

16:35.285 --> 16:36.785
I'm gonna follow my dream.

16:36.787 --> 16:38.753
Plan's kind of thin, Brad.

16:38.755 --> 16:40.088
Well, as a hot, wise woman

16:40.090 --> 16:41.589
once told me, it's gonna be great,

16:41.591 --> 16:43.692
because I'm great, you know?

16:43.694 --> 16:45.627
Uh-oh, bee alert!

16:45.629 --> 16:46.594
Frank!

16:48.965 --> 16:50.265
Got me.

16:50.267 --> 16:52.367
Just got me right on the neck there.

16:52.369 --> 16:53.768
Yep, yeppers-pedeppers.

16:53.770 --> 16:55.804
And I think it just mainlined
right in there.

16:55.806 --> 16:57.992
- Yeah, you need your EpiPen, pal.
- No, please.

16:57.993 --> 16:59.808
I got a half an hour to
quit before my throat closes,

16:59.810 --> 17:01.509
and I won't be able to
resign in the dignified manner

17:01.511 --> 17:02.677
that Travis deserves.

17:02.679 --> 17:03.812
You need to sit down, man.

17:03.814 --> 17:05.313
There you go, there you go.

17:05.315 --> 17:06.513
There you go.

17:06.516 --> 17:08.016
All right, maybe I should...

17:08.018 --> 17:08.950
just sit here and rehearse it.

17:08.952 --> 17:10.385
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

17:10.387 --> 17:11.786
Uh, uh, where's your EpiPen?

17:11.788 --> 17:12.987
In the car.

17:12.989 --> 17:15.022
Okay, I'll be right back.
Hang in there, pal.

17:15.025 --> 17:16.391
Travis,

17:16.393 --> 17:18.026
we've known each other for too long

17:18.028 --> 17:19.828
for me to dance around this.

17:19.829 --> 17:21.396
Ah, here it is!

17:21.397 --> 17:22.964
In a burrito wrapper, of course!

17:22.965 --> 17:24.098
Amy!

17:24.101 --> 17:25.967
Get it in there, get it in there,

17:25.969 --> 17:27.602
get it in there, get it...

17:27.604 --> 17:28.903
So, how you feeling?

17:28.905 --> 17:30.905
Uh, like a complete and utter idiot.

17:30.907 --> 17:32.607
I almost died more tragically

17:32.609 --> 17:34.709
than the people whose house I just sold.

17:34.711 --> 17:36.077
Now you're gonna blow past the fact

17:36.079 --> 17:37.445
that I just saved your life.

17:37.447 --> 17:38.747
What was I thinking?
I can't quit my job.

17:38.749 --> 17:39.881
Guess so.

17:39.883 --> 17:41.816
Can't start my own company.

17:41.818 --> 17:43.985
I'm great but I'm not that great.

17:43.987 --> 17:46.921
Well, you just need to have a plan
with steps in it and stuff.

17:46.923 --> 17:48.623
You know, like Allison would do.

17:48.625 --> 17:50.725
You know, Brad, I've always
been a big-picture,

17:50.727 --> 17:53.661
inspire-the-enthusiasm kind of gal.

17:53.663 --> 17:55.897
You know, like Oprah
or those cute honeys

17:55.899 --> 17:57.365
with the T-shirt cannons.

17:57.367 --> 17:58.282
Yeah, that's kind of

17:58.307 --> 17:59.334
- my thing, too.
- Right.

17:59.336 --> 18:01.970
So maybe you and me together is just...

18:01.972 --> 18:03.538
too much of an awesome thing.

18:05.801 --> 18:06.908
Oh, sorry I'm late, Travels.

18:06.910 --> 18:08.343
Oh, ooh!

18:08.345 --> 18:09.744
Sick cowboy boots, bro.

18:09.746 --> 18:11.012
Yeah, man.

18:11.014 --> 18:12.080
Getting out way ahead of that trend.

18:12.082 --> 18:13.748
This is an awful mess.

18:13.750 --> 18:15.016
It's casual Friday.

18:15.018 --> 18:16.484
We don't do that.

18:16.486 --> 18:17.852
- Yeah, how you doing?
- Hey.

18:17.854 --> 18:19.454
You buying or are you selling?

18:19.456 --> 18:21.022
- Squatting.
- Sexy.

18:21.024 --> 18:22.957
Mm. Go get 'em, tiger!

18:24.594 --> 18:26.060
Hey, Frank! Oh.

18:26.062 --> 18:27.562
So glad you're back.

18:28.999 --> 18:31.766
I just wish I could help Allison.

18:31.768 --> 18:33.635
But, dude, she signed
the contract, it's not like...

18:33.637 --> 18:36.538
No, no, no. I know
you did a stint in legal.

18:37.474 --> 18:38.840
Really?

18:38.842 --> 18:40.008
My gosh, you're right!

18:40.010 --> 18:41.709
She pulls out her hair!

18:41.711 --> 18:43.912
That qualifies as “bodily harm”"

18:43.914 --> 18:45.547
This is great!

18:45.549 --> 18:46.714
I can go help Allison.

18:46.716 --> 18:49.384
Thanks for the loophole, dude.

18:53.630 --> 18:55.130
Hi!

18:55.132 --> 18:57.165
Do you want beautiful,
youthful-looking skin?

18:57.167 --> 19:00.769
Then our next product is
exactly what you need.

19:00.771 --> 19:02.270
Hi, I'm Dr. Allison Fuller,

19:02.272 --> 19:04.673
and I am here to tell
you about an innovative line

19:04.675 --> 19:06.942
of skin care produ...

19:13.584 --> 19:15.116
Sun, lots of fun, safe.

19:15.118 --> 19:16.418
Yes.

19:16.420 --> 19:19.187
But sun can also be damaging.

19:19.189 --> 19:22.424
Which is why your all-natural
sunblock is so effective.

19:22.426 --> 19:23.558
False.

19:23.560 --> 19:25.126
Rwanda.

19:25.128 --> 19:26.728
Pass!

19:26.730 --> 19:28.697
This is where we'd go to commercial

19:28.699 --> 19:30.599
if this whole thing wasn't
one giant commercial.

19:30.601 --> 19:33.535
But...

19:33.537 --> 19:36.071
we'll stay here and
talk about Fuller and Fuller

19:36.073 --> 19:39.441
and how full your
life will be with them...

19:39.443 --> 19:42.244
You're doing great.

19:42.246 --> 19:43.845
In making your skin fuller and...

19:43.847 --> 19:46.248
Fuller and Fuller Dermatology

19:46.250 --> 19:48.617
has launched an innovative
line of skin care products

19:48.619 --> 19:51.753
to treat a variety of skin conditions.

19:51.755 --> 19:55.924
Conditions include
acne, psoriasis, eczema.

19:55.926 --> 19:59.928
Fuller and Fuller's
patented blend of all...

19:59.930 --> 20:03.331
I hear you had a mild uptick in sales.

20:03.333 --> 20:04.799
They're pretty much flat.

20:04.801 --> 20:07.202
But I did get over my
fear of being on camera.

20:07.204 --> 20:09.304
Can we not pause it on the full frontal?

20:09.306 --> 20:11.606
My fear of you being on
camera is stronger than ever.

20:11.608 --> 20:13.174
Or we can fast-forward to the part

20:13.176 --> 20:15.243
where I almost hurdle over
the lotion pyramid.

20:15.245 --> 20:17.812
Which, judging by the
comments, is a fan favorite.

20:17.814 --> 20:19.281
Okay, I need to say something

20:19.283 --> 20:21.816
before you make me regret it.

20:21.818 --> 20:24.753
Sometimes I need your...

20:24.755 --> 20:27.122
relentless positivity.

20:27.124 --> 20:28.456
Hey, this only works

20:28.458 --> 20:30.592
because of your crushing
self-criticism.

20:30.594 --> 20:32.794
So thank you

20:32.796 --> 20:34.529
for treating yourself like crap.

20:34.531 --> 20:36.131
Now I have

20:36.133 --> 20:37.632
some new paperwork I need you to sign

20:37.634 --> 20:39.734
that once again gives me full liability

20:39.736 --> 20:41.636
for your beautiful humanness.

20:41.638 --> 20:42.837
Of course.

20:42.839 --> 20:44.205
Is this it?

20:44.207 --> 20:45.507
Allison, that is

20:45.509 --> 20:47.175
a blank piece of paper.

20:47.177 --> 20:49.544
My bee is drawing up
the official document.

20:49.546 --> 20:51.313
Of course.
