01:23.617 --> 01:25.517
Thanks.

01:25.519 --> 01:27.586
That's good for business.

01:29.490 --> 01:31.156
Thank you.

01:31.158 --> 01:35.360
<i>¶ Mr. Sandman,
bring me a dream ¶</i>

01:35.362 --> 01:38.230
<i>¶ Make him the cutest
that I've ever seen... ¶</i>

01:38.232 --> 01:39.832
Excuse me!

01:39.834 --> 01:43.368
<i>¶ Give him two lips
like roses in clover ¶</i>

01:43.370 --> 01:46.839
<i>¶ Then tell him that
his lonely nights are over ¶</i>

01:46.841 --> 01:51.143
<i>¶ Sandman, I'm so alone ¶</i>

01:51.145 --> 01:55.280
<i>¶ Don't have nobody
to call my own ¶</i>

01:55.282 --> 01:58.417
<i>¶ Please turn on
your magic beam ¶</i>

01:58.419 --> 02:02.721
<i>¶ Mr. Sandman,
bring me a dream... ¶</i>

02:05.192 --> 02:07.126
That's a hell
of a move, darling.

02:07.128 --> 02:09.261
- I never get tired of it.
- Thanks, Mom.

02:09.263 --> 02:11.396
- Maybe take your hair down.
- Why?

02:11.398 --> 02:13.298
Scott came
to see us yesterday.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.267
What does that have
to do with my hair?

02:15.269 --> 02:16.502
Did he come and get
his belt sander?

02:16.504 --> 02:20.305
No. He came
to get our blessings.

02:20.307 --> 02:21.840
What?

02:25.146 --> 02:29.281
<i>¶ Mister Sandman,
bring us a dream ¶</i>

02:29.283 --> 02:32.784
<i>¶ Give him a pair of eyes
with a come hither gleam ¶</i>

02:32.786 --> 02:36.488
<i>¶ Give him a lonely heart
like Pagliacci... ¶</i>

02:36.490 --> 02:37.890
Wow.

02:37.892 --> 02:41.393
<i>¶ And lots of wavy hair
like Liberace ¶</i>

02:41.395 --> 02:44.763
<i>¶ Mister Sandman,
someone to hold... ¶</i>

02:44.765 --> 02:46.598
Hi, Scott.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.601
<i>¶ Would be so peachy
before we're too old ¶</i>

02:49.603 --> 02:52.738
<i>¶ So please turn on
your magic beam ¶</i>

02:52.740 --> 02:56.875
<i>¶ Mister Sandman,
bring us a dream ¶</i>

02:56.877 --> 02:58.844
<i>¶ Please turn on
your magic beam... ¶</i>

02:58.846 --> 03:02.214
He is so awesome.
What a dreamboat.

03:02.216 --> 03:03.815
You get everything.

03:03.817 --> 03:06.385
Nobody gets everything, Brenda.
You hang in there.

03:15.930 --> 03:18.230
Vintage Cruising Night
looks great.

03:18.232 --> 03:20.265
Yeah, it does.

03:20.267 --> 03:23.835
You notice
anything different?

03:23.837 --> 03:28.407
Maybe how you're feeling today
or how I'm feeling today?

03:28.409 --> 03:31.543
Nah, I got the...
got the...

03:31.545 --> 03:33.245
Oh, you got the new
Bluetooth Oakleys.

03:33.247 --> 03:34.613
- Oh, that's exciting.
- It is exciting.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.415
But guess who had
to pay for them? Me.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.617
- Can you believe that?
- Oh, that's so not right.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.219
Well, it's the principle.

03:40.221 --> 03:42.387
We shouldn't have
to pay to do our jobs.

03:42.389 --> 03:45.290
80% of police authority comes
from controlling eye contact

03:45.292 --> 03:47.492
like I'm doing here
right here with you. See?

03:47.494 --> 03:48.660
- Mm-hmm.
- Anyway...

03:48.662 --> 03:49.828
I want to talk
about tonight.

03:49.830 --> 03:50.996
Okay.

03:50.998 --> 03:52.731
I'm taking you
to a special dinner.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.533
Got your shift covered.
Don't worry about it.

03:54.535 --> 03:56.335
- I already talked to Bobby.
- Right now?

03:56.337 --> 03:57.869
Right now.

03:57.871 --> 03:59.238
Where we going?

03:59.240 --> 04:00.973
Only the best restaurant
in town.

04:00.975 --> 04:05.510
No way.
<i>Yeah,</i>
The Fancy Gondola.

04:05.512 --> 04:09.281
<i>So cool.</i>
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>
It's right there.

04:09.283 --> 04:12.284
All these people,
most of them are like lawyers,

04:12.286 --> 04:14.486
and professionals,
and judges, and stuff.

04:14.488 --> 04:16.321
- Wow.
- Alice...

04:17.891 --> 04:20.358
This was voted
best alfredo in Smith County

04:20.361 --> 04:21.627
three years in a row.

04:26.333 --> 04:28.834
We've been dating for,
what, eight months now?

04:28.836 --> 04:30.469
Uh-huh.

04:30.471 --> 04:32.804
And I will never forget
the first day you skated

04:32.806 --> 04:35.841
up to my motorcycle.

04:35.843 --> 04:37.776
And our eyes met.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.881
Excuse me, do you know
how long it's going to be?

04:42.883 --> 04:45.317
<i>Yeah, about 25 minutes tops.</i>

04:45.319 --> 04:46.551
<i>I don't mind
if you eat while I work.</i>

04:46.553 --> 04:48.387
Let's just move
to another table.

04:48.389 --> 04:49.788
No, no, we're not moving.
They don't have anything else.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.390
This is the best table.
It's the Gondola table.

04:51.392 --> 04:52.858
- It's the Gondola table.
- It's romantic.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.793
- It's very romantic.
- Took me two weeks to get it.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.728
Or I would have been
doing this two weeks ago.

05:01.769 --> 05:04.703
Alice, I love you
for who you are.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.538
For richer or poorer.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.073
In sickness and in health.

05:08.075 --> 05:10.976
You are my precious
honeycomb cluster.

05:10.978 --> 05:14.012
Excuse me, sir.
Is there an issue?

05:14.014 --> 05:15.814
The ambiance
is a little nail gunning.

05:15.816 --> 05:16.948
Right.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.383
I planned this
with your restaurant.

05:18.385 --> 05:19.751
I don't know why
this is all happening.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.386
Who's the genius who decided
to do construction

05:21.388 --> 05:23.021
during all of this?
This is outrageous.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.656
I can't believe this.
This is...

05:24.658 --> 05:26.825
My whole marriage proposal
is ruined.

05:26.827 --> 05:30.329
No it's not, Scotty.
Go, go.

05:30.331 --> 05:31.563
All right,
we're very sorry, sir.

05:31.565 --> 05:34.045
Just bear with us
another minute.

05:36.103 --> 05:38.403
Oh, it's too tight.

05:38.405 --> 05:39.571
I mean,
it's perfect.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.106
I mean,
my finger's too big.

05:41.108 --> 05:44.943
The honeycomb cluster
does have large knuckles.

05:44.945 --> 05:47.346
Yes, yes,
I will marry you.

05:47.348 --> 05:49.881
From the bottom
of my heart,

05:49.883 --> 05:52.384
it would be
my honor to be...

05:52.386 --> 05:53.585
Ow!

05:59.960 --> 06:01.860
It's imbedded deep
in the forward part

06:01.862 --> 06:03.995
of the left front lobe.

06:03.997 --> 06:05.997
Two inches below the scalp.

06:05.999 --> 06:08.533
We have to be extremely careful.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.502
She could be
brain damaged for life.

06:20.748 --> 06:25.117
Wait! She has no insurance.
Shut it down.

06:25.119 --> 06:27.919
Thank you, Arlene.
You're an angel.

06:27.921 --> 06:30.455
Oh, I'm starving.
Where'd those hamburgers go?

06:30.457 --> 06:32.791
<i>- You have to operate.
- This is an emergency.</i>

06:32.793 --> 06:34.860
Emergency.
That's a very interesting word.

06:34.862 --> 06:37.129
A gunshot wound
or the belly is bleeding,

06:37.131 --> 06:40.031
that's an emergency.
This girl's not bleeding.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.633
She can get up
and walk right out of here.

06:41.635 --> 06:45.404
Might be an emergency
in a week or a month,

06:45.406 --> 06:47.406
but not today.

06:47.408 --> 06:51.843
I am sick and tired of uninsured
25-year-olds coming in here

06:51.845 --> 06:55.914
and expecting
our services for free.

06:55.916 --> 06:59.851
Plus, we're liable,
which means we could
end up paying you.

06:59.853 --> 07:02.454
<i>Why don't you just</i>
<i>file a lawsuit against</i>
<i>The Fancy Gondola?</i>

07:02.456 --> 07:05.090
<i>With the courts and all,
it would take years to collect.</i>

07:05.092 --> 07:07.125
Wait.

07:07.127 --> 07:08.960
How much could
this cost anyway?

07:08.962 --> 07:11.530
How could it be $150,000
to pull a nail out?

07:11.532 --> 07:13.465
It's brain surgery.

07:13.467 --> 07:16.067
It's stuck in the sesamoid bone
that's behind the nose.

07:16.069 --> 07:17.903
It's deep. It's not good.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.938
Maybe we could get married
and then I can be

07:19.940 --> 07:21.106
on Scott's plan.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.741
Okay, then the nail would be

07:22.743 --> 07:26.077
a preexisting condition
and the insurer won't pay.

07:26.079 --> 07:28.513
Well, what if we just
leave it in there?

07:28.515 --> 07:31.016
You know, I think I feel like
I've seen this on the internet.

07:31.018 --> 07:33.051
You know, some rocker dude
has nails in his head

07:33.053 --> 07:35.153
and he's fine.
I could be fine.

07:35.155 --> 07:37.055
It depends on
where it is.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.791
And yours is in
a super unlucky place.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.526
Okay, how unlucky
are we talking, Doc?

07:41.528 --> 07:43.662
I deal with odds
on a daily basis, okay?

07:43.664 --> 07:44.830
That's my job.
What are the odds

07:44.832 --> 07:47.065
of Alice being
completely messed up?

07:47.067 --> 07:49.468
She could lose
mouth motor control,

07:49.470 --> 07:50.836
have slurred speech.

07:50.838 --> 07:54.639
Have a lifetime
of heavy drooling.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.741
Not a fun wife.

07:56.743 --> 08:01.646
Well, our love is stronger
than that, right, Scotty?

08:01.648 --> 08:03.615
Scotty?

08:07.187 --> 08:09.338
Scotty?

08:09.339 --> 08:11.490
Let's just see what
the doctors have to say.

08:11.492 --> 08:14.826
Another option, if the nail
shifts within the lobe,

08:14.828 --> 08:19.164
then she's likely to lose
all kinds of inhibitions.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.665
Oh, that's
really good, right?

08:20.667 --> 08:22.033
Yeah,
that could be good.

08:22.035 --> 08:25.504
Frankly, that's kind of
a pain in the ass.

08:25.506 --> 08:28.173
Might be good for sex.

08:34.581 --> 08:37.148
Well, maybe I can
finally have an orgasm.

08:37.150 --> 08:40.852
Okay, honey.
So, private.

08:40.854 --> 08:43.554
I already told you
that 50 to 60% of women

08:43.557 --> 08:45.590
don't have orgasms
from intercourse.

08:45.592 --> 08:47.592
What about you starting
gentle like I asked?

08:47.594 --> 08:49.861
And then taking it at the ankle
that I really like?

08:51.231 --> 08:52.931
Anyway, so.

08:52.933 --> 08:56.001
The nail in this lobe
could actually

08:56.003 --> 09:00.105
cause her fits of panic,
unpredictable moments

09:00.107 --> 09:01.907
of wrath, rage, anger.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.708
Ah, yeah, I read
that same article.

09:03.710 --> 09:06.678
And she could start speaking
fragments of a foreign language

09:06.680 --> 09:08.847
that maybe she was
exposed to as a child.

09:08.849 --> 09:11.016
It's crazy, but it happens.
I've seen it once before.

09:11.018 --> 09:13.251
Oh, my God.
Remember Portuguese Jimena,

09:13.253 --> 09:14.619
my babysitter?

09:14.621 --> 09:17.155
I wanted her to be
in the bridesmaid.

09:17.157 --> 09:20.759
Yeah, yeah, Jimena,

09:20.761 --> 09:22.260
yeah, the babysitter.

09:22.262 --> 09:23.628
What are you doing?

09:23.630 --> 09:26.197
Needs to be resized, right?

09:26.199 --> 09:28.800
Well, are we still engaged?

09:28.802 --> 09:30.168
- Let's just...
- We are, right?

09:30.170 --> 09:32.070
Let's focus on fixing
your head right now.

09:32.072 --> 09:35.040
And take it
from there, okay?

09:35.042 --> 09:37.282
This will give you
good luck for now.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.812
Did you just exchange
her engagement ring

09:40.814 --> 09:42.981
for a chicken foot?

09:42.983 --> 09:44.749
Okay, first of all,
it's a hawk talon.

09:44.751 --> 09:45.917
It's very meaningful
to me.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.353
Alice knows that.

09:48.355 --> 09:52.257
It's brought me great luck
over the years 90% of the time.

09:52.259 --> 09:55.026
How's my baby?

09:55.028 --> 09:59.764
- Oh, Mom. Dad.
- Oh, baby, aw.

09:59.766 --> 10:02.601
Will you please
pay for my surgery?

10:02.603 --> 10:04.369
Well, sure we will.

10:04.371 --> 10:06.237
Hawk talon's
working already.

10:06.239 --> 10:10.075
- How much is it?
<i>- 150,000.</i>

10:11.945 --> 10:14.245
150,000?

10:14.247 --> 10:16.815
We don't have
that kind of money.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.850
I thought I was
on your health plan.

10:18.852 --> 10:20.085
Oh, no, baby.

10:20.087 --> 10:21.686
That stopped when
you were 22, remember?

10:21.688 --> 10:25.323
We gave you the choice
to have basic healthcare

10:25.325 --> 10:29.694
or a credit card that Daddy
would pay up to 500 a year.

10:29.696 --> 10:32.030
I remember. At the time,
I thought the credit card

10:32.032 --> 10:34.299
sounded more fun,
but now I think insurance

10:34.301 --> 10:37.335
- sounds like more fun.
<i>That's the</i>
way it goes.

10:37.337 --> 10:40.905
Bob, we could take out
a second mortgage on the house
to pay for this.

10:40.907 --> 10:42.674
- Yes.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:42.676 --> 10:46.244
No, no, no.
We already have a second
mortgage on the house.

10:46.246 --> 10:50.415
Oh. Well, didn't somebody
get engaged today?

10:50.417 --> 10:53.084
- That's on hold.
- What?

10:53.086 --> 10:54.986
- Yeah.
- Oh, no. Oh, no, no.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.321
- You are still engaged.
- We're going to fix that.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.023
We're going to fix that
lickety-split.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.691
- That's right.
- We're going to fix it, mm-hmm.

10:59.693 --> 11:02.060
You're engaged.
We'll have a fundraiser.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.204
You look good.

11:16.777 --> 11:19.177
- Hi, Alice. -
<i>Welcome. Read</i>
about the brain surgery.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.879
<i>Hi, read about
the brain surgery?</i>

11:20.881 --> 11:22.113
How are you?
Read about the brain surgery?

11:22.115 --> 11:23.748
Here you go.
Don't lose that.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.116
- Hey you.
- Hey, Brenda, how are ya?

11:25.118 --> 11:27.719
- You look good.
- So do you.

11:27.721 --> 11:29.441
Read about the brain surgery?
There's yours.

11:30.290 --> 11:34.759
Oh, that spongy feeling
is hard to resist.

11:34.761 --> 11:36.394
That's your brain,
you know.

11:36.396 --> 11:39.197
Yeah, that's my brain.
So please stop pushing on it.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.199
I am a doctor,
remember?

11:41.201 --> 11:42.434
An animal doctor.

11:42.436 --> 11:43.868
Cows can't tell you
when it hurts.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.104
They can tell me.

11:46.106 --> 11:48.740
Alice, some other people
with uninsured injuries
have shown up.

11:48.742 --> 11:51.042
What? Why can't they get
their own fundraisers?

11:51.044 --> 11:52.877
No, I think they're here
to support you.

11:52.879 --> 11:56.147
- It's like a solidarity thing.
- You remember Reverend Norm?

11:56.149 --> 11:57.849
Hi.

11:57.851 --> 11:59.184
Sorry I haven't been to church
in, like, seven years.

11:59.186 --> 12:00.719
I've been pretty busy.

12:00.721 --> 12:02.353
Well, maybe this crisis
will bring you back to God.

12:02.355 --> 12:05.356
As it brought Keyshawn.
My own crisis has
driven me away.

12:05.358 --> 12:07.192
I'm on a little sabbatical
at the moment.

12:07.194 --> 12:08.359
They put him
on indefinite leave

12:08.361 --> 12:09.728
because of his
medical situation.

12:09.730 --> 12:10.895
It was a sabbatical.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.764
They forced him
to take a break.

12:12.766 --> 12:13.932
<i>Okay, that's not important.</i>

12:13.934 --> 12:15.366
Oh, it's important.

12:15.368 --> 12:18.903
He prayed to God to save
his 40-year-old marriage.

12:18.905 --> 12:21.306
And God answered
with Viagra and Cialis.

12:21.308 --> 12:22.874
And that didn't work.

12:22.876 --> 12:25.410
Then he answered with
an experimental super pill.

12:25.412 --> 12:28.813
<i>- I signed a waiver.
- You see this?</i>

12:28.815 --> 12:30.949
<i>No one wants</i>
to hear this.
- Wow.

12:30.951 --> 12:36.254
- Okay, super.
Let's go, Scott.
- Okay.

12:36.256 --> 12:39.023
Did you see the size of that
preacher's basket. Whoa.

12:39.025 --> 12:40.992
Hi, everyone.
I just want to thank

12:40.994 --> 12:42.827
you all for coming.
You're all under arrest.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.531
Just kidding. I just wanted
to say that it's time

12:46.533 --> 12:48.366
to make a request
for donations.

12:48.368 --> 12:50.869
So I wanted to say that...

12:50.871 --> 12:53.404
Sorry. Sorry.
Alice, the speakers
aren't wired right.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.006
Fix something, please.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.941
Okay, I've prepared
some remarks.

12:56.943 --> 12:59.077
Please don't leave.
Why is everyone leaving?

12:59.079 --> 13:01.546
6.33, 6.34.

13:01.548 --> 13:04.082
Some stupid change
from Cousin Al.

13:04.084 --> 13:07.018
- Does the bank even cash
a check for a dollar?
- That's from Jim.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.253
People said they
woulda gave more

13:08.255 --> 13:10.155
if it was another organ
like a kidney.

13:10.157 --> 13:12.423
What's she supposed to do?
Stick a nail in her liver?

13:12.425 --> 13:14.893
I specifically asked
for the speakers to be wired...

13:14.895 --> 13:16.361
- I tried.
<i>It's not cool</i>
when you can't get

13:16.363 --> 13:18.429
financial backing
from white people.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.431
We'll just have to get the funds
the old-fashioned way.

13:20.433 --> 13:23.067
- Work and save.
- I can't. I got fired.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.109
That's bad for business.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.978
Nobody gets everything,
remember, Alice?

13:33.980 --> 13:35.914
Hang in there.

13:35.916 --> 13:38.383
There's gotta be
something we can do.

13:38.385 --> 13:41.586
News flash, I've been a large
animal vet for 23 years.

13:41.588 --> 13:44.455
I've seen pitchforks and
backhoes imbedded in cow heads.

13:44.457 --> 13:46.291
<i>I think I can handle this.</i>

13:48.962 --> 13:51.429
I do not approve.
You do not have my
consent, Alice.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.431
This nail is coming
between you and me

13:53.433 --> 13:55.066
and everything, Scotty.
It's got to go.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.835
If something goes wrong,
don't blame me.

13:56.837 --> 14:00.505
Hey, I don't want talk like that
in my operating theater.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.240
<i>- Not my fault.</i>
- Anesthesia.

14:02.242 --> 14:04.375
<i>Pass the anesthesia.</i>

14:04.377 --> 14:07.478
It's how the cowboys
did it.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.480
Hey, why are you
drinking that?

14:09.482 --> 14:11.049
<i>Yeah. Why is
the doctor drinking?</i>

14:11.051 --> 14:13.551
- Steadies the hands.
<i>- I like her.</i>

14:13.553 --> 14:15.887
<i>Maybe she could
do us next, Rev.</i>

14:15.889 --> 14:17.355
<i>Let's see how
this goes first.</i>

14:17.357 --> 14:18.990
<i>Google doesn't
show much similarity</i>

14:18.992 --> 14:21.392
<i>between a cow brain
and a human brain.</i>

14:21.394 --> 14:23.928
Google's not
always right, you know.
Neither is Wikipedia.

14:23.930 --> 14:25.296
I think kids just
make up stuff there.

14:25.298 --> 14:27.365
- Reverend, please.
- Prayer.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.534
<i>Bless this crazy, scary
ramshackle operation.</i>

14:29.536 --> 14:31.870
Guide Rita's hands.
Protect Alice, Amen.

14:31.872 --> 14:35.006
Okay, here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna take these tweezers

14:35.008 --> 14:38.443
<i>and I'm gonna go in about</i>
<i>three-and-a-half to four</i>
<i>centimeters.</i>

14:38.445 --> 14:40.144
And I'm gonna find
that nail.

14:40.146 --> 14:41.512
Ugh.

14:44.885 --> 14:47.118
I have to...

14:47.120 --> 14:48.887
I got to get down
in there pretty...

14:48.889 --> 14:50.889
Oh.

14:50.891 --> 14:53.291
What? I can't even see
the nail exactly.

14:53.293 --> 14:54.993
- Oh.
- God, I hope I'm not just

14:54.995 --> 14:57.061
- making the hole bigger.
- Then stop!

14:57.063 --> 14:59.063
Wait, wait!

14:59.065 --> 15:00.431
We're hitting nail.

15:00.433 --> 15:01.666
Okay, okay.

15:03.503 --> 15:05.370
You can do this.

15:05.372 --> 15:07.972
- Good.
- Ooh. Whoa.

15:07.974 --> 15:09.307
I got it, got it, got it.

15:09.309 --> 15:10.575
Oh, I lost the grip.

15:10.577 --> 15:13.544
- Aw, come on.
<i>- I lost it.</i>

15:13.546 --> 15:14.946
It's like
a watermelon seed.

15:14.948 --> 15:16.381
You know, slip...
Ooh.

15:16.383 --> 15:18.216
Damn, Alice!

15:18.218 --> 15:21.119
<i>Oh, boy. Oh, boy.</i>

15:21.121 --> 15:23.354
Ew.

15:25.392 --> 15:27.926
Son of a bitch!
I hate all you people!

15:31.598 --> 15:32.397
Alice!
Wha...

15:32.398 --> 15:33.197
<i>Jesus, it's like the exorcist.</i>

15:33.199 --> 15:35.266
Damn it, Rita,
you hit the angry brain part.

15:35.268 --> 15:36.534
You disturbed
the nail, Rita!

15:36.536 --> 15:38.102
I did the best I could
with what I had!

15:38.104 --> 15:39.637
I'm just scared.
I'm really scared.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.439
- Where's my brain?
- What happened to her face?

15:41.441 --> 15:43.975
- What happened to my face?
- It's just soot, baby.

15:43.977 --> 15:45.710
Now, everybody back up
and give her some room.

15:45.712 --> 15:48.546
It's what we do
with a mad cow.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.949
All right, you got to treat this
like an unpredictable gunman.

15:50.951 --> 15:53.251
Engage and contain.
You all stay back.

15:53.253 --> 15:54.385
Alice?

15:56.389 --> 15:57.689
Just two people
talkin' here, right?

15:57.691 --> 15:59.324
No one needs
to get hurt today.

15:59.326 --> 16:00.725
- Scott, I'm so nervous.
- I'm going to help.

16:00.727 --> 16:03.127
Give me the poker.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.529
And do exactly as I say.

16:04.531 --> 16:07.265
I want you to breath in
and breath out.

16:07.267 --> 16:08.599
You work
for the government.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.201
Can you have
the government fix my head?

16:10.203 --> 16:12.003
That's an insane thought.
Block it out.

16:12.005 --> 16:14.639
"Oh, the government has to pay
for my Bluetooth Oakleys,

16:14.641 --> 16:17.041
and my photon tasers,
but to pay for Alice's surgery,

16:17.043 --> 16:19.310
that's insane because
we had to sit at the dangerous
Gondola table."

16:19.312 --> 16:22.180
That table is very romantic
99% of the time.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.449
- It's the nail talking, Scott.
- She loved the Gondola table.

16:24.451 --> 16:26.284
I just don't think
she really appreciates

16:26.286 --> 16:29.354
all of the time and energy that
I spent planning that proposal.

16:29.356 --> 16:32.390
You know, it was about us.
And now it's about her.
You know, "I'm hurt.

16:32.392 --> 16:34.492
- I need the attention."
- She doesn't want
this attention.

16:34.494 --> 16:37.028
You think I want this attention?
I can't control this.

16:37.030 --> 16:38.663
<i>Look, she</i>
can't control it.
- Did you resize my ring?

16:38.665 --> 16:41.065
Why don't you resize
it for this finger?

16:41.067 --> 16:42.734
Okay,
that's unacceptable.

16:42.736 --> 16:45.103
I'm sorry. I don't know
what's happening to me.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.472
All right, that's it.

16:48.541 --> 16:49.741
We need some space.

16:49.743 --> 16:51.109
- Oh.
- Oh.

16:51.111 --> 16:52.744
He broke it off.
That's cold.

16:55.048 --> 16:57.148
I do not know
what that meant.

16:57.150 --> 16:59.183
I think she's asking
in Portuguese

16:59.185 --> 17:01.152
if you're breaking up
with her.

17:01.154 --> 17:03.721
Are you, Scott,
breaking up with me?

17:03.723 --> 17:05.589
Are you ending
our engagement?

17:05.592 --> 17:09.560
I don't want to, but right now
the odds are looking 65-35

17:09.561 --> 17:12.063
that you, Alice,
are turning into an angry,

17:12.065 --> 17:13.731
panicky Portuguese mess.

17:15.667 --> 17:18.368
Maybe there's
an 80 to 70% chance of us

17:18.371 --> 17:19.604
getting back together
if you get fixed.

17:19.606 --> 17:21.439
But that depends
on how long it takes.

17:21.441 --> 17:24.108
You left the door open a crack.
But that never works out.

17:24.109 --> 17:26.778
- It's a mirage.
- You just broke up with me.

17:26.780 --> 17:28.780
Yes. It has to be this way.
I'm sorry. It's necessary.

17:28.782 --> 17:30.448
That's mean.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.517
What happened to nobody
getting hurt today?

17:32.519 --> 17:34.719
Things don't always
go as planned.

17:34.721 --> 17:37.588
- Scott, Scott.
<i>No, Scott, don't go.</i>
No, please.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.757
- I'm sorry.
- Won't you please stay, Scott?

17:39.759 --> 17:41.626
- Come on, Scott.
- No, Scott.

17:41.628 --> 17:44.295
<i>- Don't do it, man!</i>
- Just let it out.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.297
<i>- Scotty!</i>
- Yeah.

17:46.299 --> 17:49.500
You can stay here with us
for a little while.

18:00.380 --> 18:03.548
- Hi.
- Hello, Reverend, Keyshawn.

18:03.550 --> 18:07.385
- How's our girl doing?
- Well, there's a weensy
tad of depression

18:07.387 --> 18:10.354
kicking in since the breakup,
but she'll perk right up

18:10.356 --> 18:12.690
when she sees you two.
Would you like to come in?

18:12.692 --> 18:14.292
Well, thank you.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.734
<i>- Honey.
- Look who's here.</i>

18:17.764 --> 18:21.732
- Alice, what's up?
- Hi, Alice.

18:21.734 --> 18:24.735
- Yikes.
- Maybe she should
go outside and get some air.

18:24.737 --> 18:26.637
- Get out of the house.
- No, no.

18:26.639 --> 18:29.240
<i>That really didn't work so well
with the anger thing.</i>

18:29.242 --> 18:31.409
¶ You couldn't touch me
with a 10-foot pole ¶

18:31.411 --> 18:33.144
¶ 'Cause we always
on the rhyme ¶

18:33.146 --> 18:36.180
¶ Never on a pimp stroll,
been called nuts... ¶

18:36.182 --> 18:38.149
Angry rappers helped me
to cope with my messed up

18:38.151 --> 18:40.218
medical situation, too.

18:40.220 --> 18:43.788
What exactly is your messed up
medical situation, Keyshawn?

18:43.790 --> 18:45.590
We never got a chance
to hear that.

18:45.592 --> 18:48.192
Believe me, you do not want
to hear about it.

18:48.194 --> 18:49.894
We want to hear
all about it.

18:49.896 --> 18:52.363
Misery loves company,
right, honey?

18:52.365 --> 18:53.598
Yes, please.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.367
Thank you.
My name is Keyshawn McWilliams.

18:56.369 --> 18:59.804
I couldn't get the attention
of this very fine la-de-da-de.

18:59.806 --> 19:03.708
So I decided to get into the
Pro Am Weightlifting circuit.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.910
I worked my way
to the semi-finals

19:05.912 --> 19:08.146
where I was about to break
the dead lift record

19:08.148 --> 19:09.814
to clean jerk 250.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.817
And then you couldn't
and you hurt your back.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.652
Well,
I clean jerked 250.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.821
And I learned a new word
called "prolapse",

19:16.823 --> 19:18.789
which applies to the anus.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.558
Okay, that's enough.

19:20.560 --> 19:23.194
I really don't want
to get Alice riled up.

19:23.196 --> 19:24.495
You never know what's
gonna set her off

19:24.497 --> 19:26.364
with this thing in her head.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.733
What you watching?

19:32.272 --> 19:33.871
Bob?

19:33.873 --> 19:35.940
Find something
soothing for Alice.

19:39.212 --> 19:40.745
<i>Bob?</i>

19:40.747 --> 19:44.282
And I'm glad to be out here
helping the people.

19:44.284 --> 19:47.685
<i>I like people.</i>
<i>I love gettin' out</i>
<i>of the law office.</i>

19:47.687 --> 19:50.354
<i>And, you know,
going local,</i>

19:50.356 --> 19:53.891
<i>hearin' the people,
smellin' the people.</i>

19:53.893 --> 19:55.459
<i>Government.</i>

19:55.461 --> 19:57.361
If anyone has a problem
from our district

19:57.363 --> 20:00.264
that can be fixed
by a law, I'm your man.

20:00.266 --> 20:03.367
You're invited to come visit me
any time in Washington.

20:03.369 --> 20:05.369
That's me. I'm invited.
I got to go talk to that guy.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.371
That idiot
can't help you, Alice.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.440
It's that idiot's job
to help me, Mom.

20:09.442 --> 20:11.342
He just said so and he's
not such a big idiot.

20:11.344 --> 20:13.844
He was kind and thoughtful.
I could tell.

20:13.846 --> 20:16.981
¶ Let's turn a problem
into an idea ¶

20:16.983 --> 20:18.416
I could get fixed.

20:18.418 --> 20:19.884
I could come home,
marry Scott.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.752
And then everything
would be good again.

20:21.754 --> 20:24.255
Well, it's the first time
I've seen her enthusiastic

20:24.257 --> 20:25.690
in nearly three weeks.

20:25.692 --> 20:28.426
No. No, Bob.
She's not going to Washington.

20:28.428 --> 20:29.894
Oh, I can't
take this anymore.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.429
I have to get out of here,
I have to fix my head.

20:31.431 --> 20:32.663
I've got to meet that guy.

20:32.665 --> 20:33.898
- What guy?
- Scott.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.466
<i>You see, Alice?</i>

20:35.468 --> 20:37.468
Now you don't need
to go to Washington.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.337
Did you really
come back for me, Scott?

20:39.339 --> 20:41.639
Honestly, I came
to get my belt sander.

20:41.641 --> 20:43.274
<i>And to see
if you got fixed.</i>

20:43.276 --> 20:45.509
But I guess
that didn't happen.

20:45.511 --> 20:46.677
What's with this
Washington business?

20:46.679 --> 20:48.246
That doesn't sound good.

20:48.248 --> 20:49.814
It's where I'm going
to get help.

20:49.816 --> 20:51.816
That's your crazy brain
turning on itself, Alice.

20:51.818 --> 20:54.619
You can't fix a crazy brain
with crazy thinkin'.

20:54.621 --> 20:56.520
That's broken
talking to broken.

20:56.522 --> 20:59.790
It's not broken
talkin' to broken.
It's a good idea.

20:59.792 --> 21:01.892
Or an idea.
It's the only one we've got.

21:01.894 --> 21:04.328
It's not a good one.

21:04.330 --> 21:07.698
Maybe this is
a calling of some kind.

21:07.700 --> 21:10.301
Travel with Keyshawn
would be like...

21:10.303 --> 21:14.505
Jesus spending his days
with prostitutes and lepers.

21:14.507 --> 21:15.973
Thank you.

21:15.975 --> 21:18.676
No, no, Reverend.
You can't encourage this.

21:18.678 --> 21:21.812
Listen, there is a 105%
chance that Washington

21:21.814 --> 21:25.349
is a terrible idea.
Bob, belt sander?

21:25.351 --> 21:27.718
Okay, but I may need to borrow
it back if I have to build

21:27.720 --> 21:29.687
those wheelchair ramps
for Alice.

21:38.431 --> 21:40.398
I still totally want
to talk if you get fixed.

22:45.932 --> 22:47.665
I'm sorry.
Tours are over for today.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.367
Oh, we're not here for a tour.
We're here to see

22:49.369 --> 22:51.001
- Mr. Howard Birdwell.
- Okay, Miss, I'm going to have

22:51.003 --> 22:52.636
- to ask you to step back beh...
- Oh, don't worry. Just this.

22:52.638 --> 22:54.839
Gun!

22:55.908 --> 22:58.642
It's not loaded.

22:58.644 --> 23:01.445
Oh, my God, I'm shot!

23:03.116 --> 23:05.015
You're all right,
you're all right.

23:05.017 --> 23:08.753
All right.
All right, I'm not shot.

23:08.755 --> 23:12.423
- But I am traumatized, though.
<i>- Bring her over here.</i>

23:12.425 --> 23:13.758
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
<i>- I'm so done.</i>

23:13.760 --> 23:15.860
- I can't work no more.
- What is this?

23:15.862 --> 23:18.028
I brought it to show
Howard Birdwell what
happened to me.

23:18.030 --> 23:19.897
Yeah, it wouldn't have fired
if she hadn't grabbed it.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.632
Well, what was
I supposed do to?

23:21.634 --> 23:24.568
Yeah.
She's a security guard.

23:24.570 --> 23:26.604
And a super fine one.

23:26.606 --> 23:28.506
Wow, what is your name?

23:28.508 --> 23:30.641
Rakeesha.
Everybody call me Ra-Ra.

23:30.643 --> 23:33.878
My name is Keyshawn.
My people call me Ki-Ki.

23:33.880 --> 23:37.181
- Baby, your trauma
is turning me on.
- Oh, Jesus.

23:37.183 --> 23:40.751
Let me apologize for
my insensitive white friends.

23:40.753 --> 23:43.954
And take you to Benihana's
and smooth your trauma
with a sake bomb.

23:43.956 --> 23:46.590
What? You guys
are going right now?

23:46.592 --> 23:48.793
- We just got here.
- In the black community,

23:48.795 --> 23:50.928
that's how quick
it happens.

23:50.930 --> 23:53.564
- What about our mission?
- And our dream?

23:53.566 --> 23:54.932
- Yeah.
- What about binding

23:54.934 --> 23:56.801
- the nation's wounds?
- Yeah.

23:56.803 --> 23:59.637
- What happened to that?
- Good luck.

23:59.639 --> 24:01.505
Okay, well, I guess
it's just you and me.

24:01.507 --> 24:03.174
Let's go. All right.

24:18.591 --> 24:21.592
- You ready?
- Yeah.

24:29.035 --> 24:31.469
Hi, welcome.
Information's over there.

24:31.471 --> 24:33.504
<i>And signups for appointments
take two to three weeks.</i>

24:33.506 --> 24:35.506
Oh, my God, is that him?

24:35.508 --> 24:39.477
<i>Yes, but he's very busy
on important legislation.</i>

24:39.479 --> 24:41.245
I'm starting to think
sex is overrated, you know.

24:41.247 --> 24:43.514
I mean, half the time
the connection is so-so.

24:43.516 --> 24:45.716
And then you're involved
and then blah, blah, you know?

24:45.718 --> 24:49.086
I mean, come on, I'd rather
be playing golf, Mom.

24:49.088 --> 24:51.088
Yes, I know I have
a natural charisma,

24:51.090 --> 24:52.957
but I can't get anything
done around here.

24:52.959 --> 24:54.792
It's like... it's like

24:54.794 --> 24:56.827
I just can't even get
colored glues for my kids.

24:56.829 --> 24:58.996
<i>It's killing me.
I ran on that.</i>

24:58.998 --> 25:01.065
Hey, we can't just
walk in like this.

25:01.067 --> 25:02.833
But he's right there.

25:02.835 --> 25:04.735
Oh, my God,
Representative Hendrickson.

25:04.737 --> 25:06.570
- What an honor.
- Is he in? She's in a hurry.

25:06.572 --> 25:08.706
<i>Sir, the House Whip is here!</i>

25:08.708 --> 25:11.068
You have to change for
the prayer lunch.

25:12.945 --> 25:14.745
- Howard?
- What?

25:14.747 --> 25:16.080
You're in the hot seat,
mister.

25:16.082 --> 25:17.815
What? I voted yes
on triple razor wires.

25:17.817 --> 25:19.717
I'm not talking about
the stupid immigration bill.

25:19.719 --> 25:22.186
- My moon base is in trouble.
- There was opposition ads.

25:22.188 --> 25:24.922
- What about the opposition ads?
- It was very effective
opposition ads.

25:24.924 --> 25:26.857
- Effective how?
- They want to spend
the money on schools and parks

25:26.859 --> 25:28.893
and whatever and not
a military base on the moon.

25:28.895 --> 25:30.928
We're going to get
that same school, park,

25:30.930 --> 25:33.964
whatever people
to say my moon base
will massage their needs.

25:33.966 --> 25:36.267
I didn't know
a moon base could do that.

25:36.269 --> 25:39.303
It protects us, right?
Keeps us safe and
non-blown up.

25:39.305 --> 25:41.171
Is that Pam Henry,
the lady astronaut?

25:41.173 --> 25:43.674
Yes, it is.

25:43.676 --> 25:44.842
Oh, my God.

25:44.844 --> 25:46.544
Seriously,
you have to go now.

25:46.546 --> 25:48.746
- Oh, I was invited.
- The House Whip is here.

25:48.748 --> 25:51.048
Please, can you
come back tomorrow?

25:51.050 --> 25:54.919
- Tomorrow?
- Why are you still here?

25:54.921 --> 25:56.987
'Cause we have that
meeting event this week.

25:56.989 --> 25:59.089
And I need you to get
someone with a good cause

25:59.091 --> 26:04.295
who's manageable, controllable,

26:04.297 --> 26:06.630
who will come
and endorse our moon base.

26:06.632 --> 26:08.098
This week?

26:08.100 --> 26:09.967
Didn't the school kids
just come visit you?

26:09.969 --> 26:13.137
Yeah, they were surprisingly
hard on me for eight-year-olds

26:13.139 --> 26:14.805
and I wouldn't really
want to have them back.

26:14.807 --> 26:17.708
You got to get someone, Howard.
The moon is my church.

26:17.710 --> 26:20.077
- I know it is.
- It's a really special place.

26:20.079 --> 26:24.815
- This country deserves to have
a military base there.

26:24.817 --> 26:26.750
Hey.

26:26.752 --> 26:27.985
- Bill.
- I have very good news.

26:27.987 --> 26:29.820
Girl Squaws
making us a cookie.

26:29.822 --> 26:31.622
- What?
- Yes.

26:31.624 --> 26:33.757
- No way.
- Yes.

26:33.759 --> 26:35.159
- A Girl Squaw cookie?
- Yes.

26:35.161 --> 26:36.927
- For the moon base.
- Yes!

26:36.929 --> 26:38.862
You have any idea
how important that is?

26:38.864 --> 26:40.731
It's like getting
national landmark status.

26:40.733 --> 26:41.865
I know, I know.

26:41.867 --> 26:43.601
How the hell
did you do that?

26:43.603 --> 26:45.936
Because I told them
we would get Shakira

26:45.938 --> 26:49.840
- for the National Jamboree.
- That's what I'm talking about.

26:49.842 --> 26:51.041
- I got to work.
- Yeah.

26:51.043 --> 26:53.677
- Go get 'em.
- Way to go!

26:53.679 --> 26:56.981
- Burning up the track.
<i>- Burn, baby, burn.</i>

26:56.983 --> 26:59.617
Shakira.

26:59.619 --> 27:01.051
How did he get Shakira?

27:01.053 --> 27:03.220
Well, maybe he did,
maybe he didn't.

27:03.222 --> 27:06.056
The important thing is that
he got the Girl Squaws on board.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.658
In a huge way.

27:07.660 --> 27:10.794
Oh, look at that.
I bet he got the Boy Cubs, too.

27:10.796 --> 27:12.997
- What?
- C'mon, you gotta change
for the prayer lunch.

27:12.999 --> 27:15.866
This always excites people
because it's been

27:15.868 --> 27:19.970
to outer space
three times on her body.

27:19.972 --> 27:23.340
Could you shut the door and
give me some privacy, please?

27:23.342 --> 27:25.209
You got to step up,
Howard.

27:25.211 --> 27:28.078
There are 100 guys
I could groom to replace you.

27:28.080 --> 27:30.247
So get someone
to the media event.

27:33.119 --> 27:34.818
Zip me.

27:34.820 --> 27:36.420
I get it, okay?
She's a total ball-breaker.

27:36.422 --> 27:38.922
It's very short notice.
And, frankly, not the best idea

27:38.924 --> 27:40.791
to recruit people who aren't
prepared or rehearsed

27:40.793 --> 27:42.359
- to go on camera.
- What about the prayer lunch?

27:42.361 --> 27:44.828
- I'm right behind you.
- Now.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.764
I did eight years in NASA
tech support for her, okay?

27:46.766 --> 27:48.666
Another 15 years here,
okay?

27:48.668 --> 27:50.734
She's brilliant unless
she goes off on her own.

27:50.736 --> 27:52.269
Then it's a big mess.

27:52.271 --> 27:54.171
Nightmare.
That's what I'm talking about.

27:54.173 --> 27:55.439
What are you doing?

27:55.441 --> 27:57.074
So you better
do what I'm saying, okay?

27:57.076 --> 27:59.343
We're not going
to repeat it again.

28:02.448 --> 28:06.150
All this way
and he won't even see us.

28:06.152 --> 28:08.986
Okay, do you know what?
This is what we're gonna do.

28:08.988 --> 28:10.187
We're going to go
in one of those offices

28:10.189 --> 28:11.722
and we are gonna
introduce ourselves

28:11.724 --> 28:14.758
to another one
of those guys.

28:14.760 --> 28:18.228
- My dick is killing me.
- Oh, geez.

28:18.230 --> 28:21.165
I'm sorry to say it like
that, I've been around
Keyshawn too much.

28:21.167 --> 28:24.034
- Is it bad?
- It's really hard to walk.

28:24.036 --> 28:25.469
It's really chafing.

28:25.471 --> 28:26.970
Okay, you need
to go to the motel.

28:26.972 --> 28:28.138
No, I want to
be here for you.

28:28.140 --> 28:30.074
No, no, go to the motel,
I insist.

28:30.076 --> 28:32.976
Take a bath.
There's got to
be an ice machine.

28:32.978 --> 28:34.912
That would be nice.

28:34.914 --> 28:36.280
- Go.
- You gonna be okay?

28:36.282 --> 28:37.448
- Yeah.
- I expect a full report.

28:37.450 --> 28:39.950
Okay.

28:39.952 --> 28:41.118
Feel better.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.168
We're having a meeting
in here, sorry.

29:04.443 --> 29:10.180
Piece of shit democracy.
I smash your face.

29:23.462 --> 29:25.963
Mr. Birdwell?
I'm from your district.

29:25.965 --> 29:27.231
- Yes?
- I saw you on TV.

29:27.233 --> 29:28.465
- You were great.
- Oh, thank you.

29:28.467 --> 29:29.967
And you were real.
I came to see you today.

29:29.969 --> 29:31.335
But they wouldn't
let me see you.

29:31.337 --> 29:33.804
Oh, well, it's been
a very hectic day.

29:33.806 --> 29:36.406
You have very soft
hand skin.

29:36.408 --> 29:38.308
Oh, thank you.
I roller skate a lot.

29:38.310 --> 29:41.211
Don't know what that
has to do with my hands.

29:41.213 --> 29:44.481
Sometimes the wind can make
your skin smooth or rough.

29:44.483 --> 29:46.550
I don't know.

29:46.552 --> 29:49.186
Anyway,
what brings you to D.C.?

29:49.188 --> 29:51.288
I came to see you because
I want to help people that have

29:51.290 --> 29:54.458
weird conditions that
they can't afford to fix.

29:54.460 --> 29:56.026
I guess that's healthcare.

29:56.028 --> 29:59.997
Oh, dear.
That's not very manageable.

29:59.999 --> 30:01.365
In fact, that's
kind of a bummer issue.

30:01.367 --> 30:02.566
- I'm sorry...
- Bummer issue?

30:02.568 --> 30:04.434
It takes a really long time.
Really.

30:04.436 --> 30:06.303
I mean, good luck with that
because I'm just a freshman

30:06.305 --> 30:08.438
doing freshman things, so...

30:08.440 --> 30:11.475
Why do you invite
people down here then?
Why do you say you can help?

30:11.477 --> 30:14.511
Well, you don't
think I want to help?
I want to help people.

30:14.513 --> 30:17.047
It's just it has to be the
right thing at the right time.

30:17.049 --> 30:18.916
I mean, it's not
very practical, okay?

30:18.918 --> 30:20.350
Look, I'm just trying to,
I'm sorry.

30:20.352 --> 30:21.952
Practical?

30:21.954 --> 30:23.120
I'm under a lot of pressure
right now, okay?

30:23.122 --> 30:24.822
Do you see these offices?

30:24.824 --> 30:26.890
Every single one of em has
a different person above me

30:26.892 --> 30:29.493
who tells me what to do.
They tell me what time it is,

30:29.495 --> 30:32.162
what day it is and when
they tell me to "jump, Howard,"

30:32.164 --> 30:35.032
I say how high,
Mr. or Mrs...

30:35.034 --> 30:36.366
Wow.

30:36.368 --> 30:38.569
...or exactly.
Wow, yes. See?

30:38.571 --> 30:41.405
That's what I'm talking about.
Now you're hearing me.

30:41.407 --> 30:43.207
It's hard working
for the people.

30:43.209 --> 30:46.243
It's hard working, even getting
colored glues for the kids,

30:46.245 --> 30:48.879
for the kids' people,
okay?

30:48.881 --> 30:50.921
So I don't understand, you know,
I'm trying to be...

31:00.159 --> 31:02.125
Oh, mm-hmm.

31:06.498 --> 31:08.532
That was weird.
Didn't mean to do that at all.

31:08.534 --> 31:10.267
- I don't know what's happening.
- No, it's understandable.

31:10.269 --> 31:12.102
There's the whole political
rock star mystique.

31:12.104 --> 31:14.238
That was really inappropriate.
I shouldn't...

31:14.240 --> 31:15.639
No,
it's inappropriate here.

31:15.641 --> 31:18.475
But it's not inappropriate
right in here.

31:18.477 --> 31:21.378
Nothing wrong with what you did.
Nothing wrong with what you did.

31:21.380 --> 31:24.248
<i>¶ At last... ¶</i>

31:28.621 --> 31:32.222
- <i> ¶ My love has</i>
come along... ¶

31:32.224 --> 31:34.291
- Watch out for the...
- There.

31:34.293 --> 31:37.594
- Sorry. Oh, yes.
<i>- Oh, daddy.</i>

31:37.596 --> 31:39.563
<i>¶ My lonely days
are over ¶</i>

31:39.565 --> 31:41.431
- Oh! Ah! You okay?
- Do you have any...

31:41.433 --> 31:44.101
- Yeah, wait, my hands are...
- Let me have it.

31:44.103 --> 31:46.336
Oh, God, wait.

31:46.338 --> 31:48.939
<i>¶ And life is like a song... ¶</i>

31:48.941 --> 31:50.741
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

31:56.315 --> 31:58.448
<i>¶ At last. ¶</i>

31:58.450 --> 32:00.350
Ooh.

32:00.352 --> 32:04.221
Orgasms do exist.
Yay.

32:04.223 --> 32:06.924
I've had some really,
really good sex,

32:06.926 --> 32:10.294
but that was something
completely new.

32:10.296 --> 32:14.231
Oh, my God, I'm a dirty
little nail slut.

32:14.233 --> 32:17.034
What's a nail slut?

32:17.036 --> 32:19.269
I have a three-inch nail
in here.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.171
And it sometimes
makes me do crazy things.

32:21.173 --> 32:24.608
And now it made me
get slutty, damn it.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.977
There's a nail in your head

32:26.979 --> 32:29.479
and it's neurologically
making you a whore?

32:29.481 --> 32:32.950
Yeah.
What's your excuse?

32:32.952 --> 32:35.585
Well, what's to excuse?
I think we just a case

32:35.587 --> 32:38.388
of great timing
and good luck.

32:38.390 --> 32:40.657
Well, I never would have
normally done something

32:40.659 --> 32:42.492
like this except for this.

32:42.494 --> 32:44.094
I mean, it can't all
be the nail, you know.

32:44.096 --> 32:46.630
I've been told
that I have charisma.

32:46.632 --> 32:48.665
Yes, you do.

32:48.667 --> 32:50.300
But it was the nail,
okay?

32:50.302 --> 32:52.736
Well, I'm gonna
have to disagree.

32:52.738 --> 32:55.005
And now I'm gonna
have to leave.

32:55.007 --> 32:57.174
What?

32:57.176 --> 32:58.442
Wait, wait, wait!

32:58.444 --> 33:00.143
What about
problem, problem, problem?

33:00.145 --> 33:02.245
Problem right here, going
to turn my problem into an idea.

33:02.247 --> 33:05.582
What about that, mister?

33:05.584 --> 33:08.051
What happened to that?

33:08.053 --> 33:12.990
You're appealing.

33:12.992 --> 33:16.326
Look, before, I thought that
you were some sort of, you know,

33:16.328 --> 33:20.597
not manageable policy problem,
but now you're like...

33:20.599 --> 33:23.233
a girl with a nail
in her head,

33:23.235 --> 33:24.468
and that's...

33:24.470 --> 33:28.372
very interesting
and very human.

33:28.374 --> 33:31.341
Have you ever been to a military
media moon base event before?

33:31.343 --> 33:34.177
I don't think so, no.

33:34.179 --> 33:38.782
Well, I'm inviting you
to one where you can
help us, okay?

33:38.784 --> 33:41.318
Well, wait a minute,
I thought I was the one
that needed help.

33:41.320 --> 33:43.220
Well, no, honey,
in this town,

33:43.222 --> 33:45.222
you gotta give something
to get something.

33:45.224 --> 33:47.124
Didn't we just have sex?

33:47.126 --> 33:49.693
I mean, you got
to politically give something

33:49.695 --> 33:51.628
- to politically get something.
- Right.

33:51.630 --> 33:53.263
You help me
promote the moon base

33:53.265 --> 33:56.666
and I'll get you
your healthcare bill.

33:56.668 --> 33:58.502
But I don't know anything
about a moon base.

33:58.504 --> 34:03.407
All you need to know
is that it keeps us safe
and non-blown up.

34:03.409 --> 34:05.542
<i>And it's on the moon.</i>

34:05.544 --> 34:08.245
<i>- A military moon base?
- What's a moon base do?</i>

34:08.246 --> 34:11.214
All you need to know
is that it keeps us safe
and non-blown up.

34:11.216 --> 34:12.549
And it's on the moon.

34:12.551 --> 34:14.583
And if we get behind that,
then he's going

34:14.585 --> 34:17.487
- to help us with our thing.
- Ah, that's how it works.

34:17.489 --> 34:20.757
One hand washes the other.
You know, it's amazing.

34:20.759 --> 34:23.159
What?
What's amazing, Norm?

34:23.161 --> 34:27.697
It's just so unbelievable
to me that one brief

34:27.699 --> 34:30.132
hallway conversation,
you agreed on all that.

34:30.135 --> 34:32.668
I mean, just a little talk
is just so unheard of

34:32.670 --> 34:36.373
- in Washington for people to...
- Well, that's what happened.
That's all that happened.

34:36.375 --> 34:37.841
I'm not lying
and I'm not a liar.

34:37.842 --> 34:39.676
I'm not calling you a liar.

34:39.678 --> 34:41.445
Well, good, 'cause I'm not.

34:41.447 --> 34:43.713
Gee, did you
do something different?

34:43.715 --> 34:45.449
You look really
sexy or something.

34:45.451 --> 34:47.150
Did you do something
with your hair?

34:47.152 --> 34:48.418
I don't have any hair.

34:48.420 --> 34:52.089
Yeah, okay.
Keyshawn.

34:52.091 --> 34:54.391
<i>- Where have you been?</i>
- Chilling with Rakeesha.

34:54.393 --> 34:57.828
Ah-ha. So she's
into playas after all.

34:57.830 --> 34:59.296
I ran the youth
outreach program.

34:59.298 --> 35:01.131
I know all about
the jiggy and the freaking

35:01.133 --> 35:02.732
- and what the kids are into.
- It don't matter.

35:02.734 --> 35:04.634
'Cause she's strong
and she's deep.

35:04.636 --> 35:07.604
And she loves to do beautiful
watercolors like this.

35:07.606 --> 35:10.774
Bam.
How you like me now?

35:10.776 --> 35:14.411
Oh, wow. Is that your head
on a wolf's body crying?

35:14.413 --> 35:16.546
She sees me as
the leader of the pack

35:16.548 --> 35:19.282
helping all the injured,
poor, weak wolves.

35:19.284 --> 35:21.585
<i>I like what she did
with the shading there.</i>

35:21.587 --> 35:23.487
So she's sympathetic
to your health problems, huh?

35:23.489 --> 35:24.888
No, I ain't
tell her about it.

35:24.890 --> 35:27.157
Why does she think
you're here, Keyshawn?

35:27.159 --> 35:30.127
To selflessly support
all you sad, injured people

35:30.129 --> 35:31.361
and your problems.

35:31.363 --> 35:33.230
This is why she loves me.

35:33.232 --> 35:36.166
And this is why I need y'all
to cosign on my story.

35:36.168 --> 35:37.734
'Cause I'm in love.

35:37.736 --> 35:39.302
I thought you didn't
believe in love.

35:39.304 --> 35:41.571
I'm just starting
to learn how to trust again.

35:41.573 --> 35:44.274
Don't crush the little
hatchling of my heart.

35:44.276 --> 35:46.810
Back up my lie.

35:46.812 --> 35:49.279
Love takes honesty,
Keyshawn.

35:49.281 --> 35:52.749
Rakeesha expects me to lead.

35:52.751 --> 35:54.351
You see the other
little wolves?

35:54.353 --> 35:55.619
They're hurt
and they're injured.

35:55.621 --> 35:58.922
Who's leading? Me.
I cry for you.

35:58.924 --> 36:01.758
I cry for you.

36:07.833 --> 36:09.466
<i>Slow down, kids!</i>

36:09.468 --> 36:11.234
Congresswoman,
a word, please?

36:14.706 --> 36:17.574
- Alice!
- Look, it's Howard.

36:17.576 --> 36:18.742
Hi!

36:18.744 --> 36:21.611
Hi!

36:21.613 --> 36:23.847
- Isn't this exciting?
- This is amazing, fantastic.

36:23.849 --> 36:25.815
This is Reverend Norm.

36:25.817 --> 36:27.184
- Pleasure.
- Hi.

36:27.186 --> 36:28.518
And this is Keyshawn
and Rakeesha.

36:28.520 --> 36:31.655
Hi. Kanye, Shaniqua.
Nice to meet you.

36:31.657 --> 36:33.557
So I hope you're prepared
to talk on TV.

36:33.559 --> 36:35.225
Well, I didn't
prepare anything.

36:35.227 --> 36:36.693
I didn't know I was supposed
to prepare something.

36:36.695 --> 36:39.296
Why'd he call me Kanye?
My name is Keyshawn.

36:39.298 --> 36:40.697
Speak as someone
who has an injury

36:40.699 --> 36:42.899
and who needs protection

36:42.901 --> 36:45.468
and is asking for it
from the moon base.

36:45.470 --> 36:48.305
Actually, how exactly
is the moon base
gonna help us?

36:48.307 --> 36:51.908
We have to stay
protected and...

36:51.910 --> 36:54.844
- Safe and un-blown up.
- Yes. Okay, great.

36:54.846 --> 36:57.581
Yes, but more specifically,
how exactly will the moon base

36:57.583 --> 36:59.950
- help us right now?
<i>- Yeah, good question.</i>

36:59.952 --> 37:02.719
Well, we'll talk to
the leaders about gluing

37:02.721 --> 37:05.288
on a little tiny healthcare,
emergency healthcare law,

37:05.290 --> 37:07.791
onto the big,
huge moon base bill, okay?

37:07.793 --> 37:10.360
Kinda like a little satellite
that nobody notices

37:10.362 --> 37:12.262
that's orbiting around
the big moon.

37:12.264 --> 37:14.598
- Now, that's how it's done.
- Slim shady, I like it.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.900
Yes. What is that, a song
or beef jerky or whatever?

37:16.902 --> 37:18.935
Who wants to meet
Pam Henry Hendrickson?

37:18.937 --> 37:20.937
- Oh, I do, I do, I do.
- The lady astronaut
House Whip.

37:20.939 --> 37:22.572
Let's go.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.941
Why does he call me Kanye?
My name is Keyshawn.

37:24.943 --> 37:26.810
- Congresswoman!
- Howard.

37:26.812 --> 37:28.612
Told you I'd pull through.
This is Alice Eckle.

37:28.614 --> 37:30.380
Pam Henry Hendrickson.
Nice to meet you.

37:30.382 --> 37:31.648
Hi. Do you think
you'd have time,

37:31.650 --> 37:33.516
you could maybe
sign my card later?

37:33.518 --> 37:35.518
I've seen all your launches
ever since I was in sixth grade.

37:35.520 --> 37:37.854
Oh, that's so nice.

37:37.856 --> 37:41.691
Actually, that's the same age
that Grand Sacajawea
Marsha Weber is.

37:41.693 --> 37:43.960
- Grand Saca what?
- Jawea. Sixth grade.

37:43.962 --> 37:45.962
Hi, are you
a congressman, too?

37:45.964 --> 37:48.365
No. I'm an ex-waitress
with a nail in my head

37:48.367 --> 37:49.866
that might get fixed
by the little law

37:49.868 --> 37:51.835
that's going to tack on
to the moon base bill.

37:51.837 --> 37:54.938
- We're getting Shakira.
Awesome, right?
- Yeah, totally.

37:54.940 --> 37:57.274
<i>Yeah, we're not supposed
to talk about that stuff.</i>

37:57.276 --> 37:58.742
Just keep the focus
on the moon base tonight.
Right, Mr. Harshtone?

37:58.744 --> 38:00.810
That's right, Marsha.
Very good.

38:00.812 --> 38:04.281
Actually, Alice happens
to be giving a speech,
too, Congressman.

38:04.283 --> 38:06.916
Oh, that's good, Howard,
but she's giving one right now.

38:06.918 --> 38:08.652
Here we go, Marsha.

38:08.654 --> 38:10.820
Grand Sacajawea Marsha Weber,
are you here to put

38:10.822 --> 38:12.289
a military base on the moon?

38:12.291 --> 38:14.057
We totally
want a hiking camp

38:14.059 --> 38:15.625
while they just
patrol the skies.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.861
Moon base rocks. Booyah.

38:21.433 --> 38:23.833
Nope, this way.

38:23.835 --> 38:25.435
Camera's right there,
all right?

38:25.437 --> 38:27.404
And the moon base
is right behind you, okay?

38:27.406 --> 38:29.673
So talk about all this stuff
that we talked about before

38:29.675 --> 38:31.441
and not the stuff we talked
about after that, okay?

38:31.443 --> 38:33.443
- Okay.
- Look at me, I'm nervous.

38:33.445 --> 38:36.446
- Ready? Look at you.
You look great.
- I do?

38:36.448 --> 38:38.348
- You're beautiful.
- Thank you.

38:38.350 --> 38:40.750
- I believe in you.
- You do?

38:40.752 --> 38:42.852
Yeah.

38:46.792 --> 38:50.327
I have a nail in my head
so I need a moon base.

38:50.329 --> 38:53.029
Why? Well, I can't
afford surgery.

38:53.031 --> 38:56.399
So my congressman,
who looks like a dude
from Crest White Strips,

38:56.401 --> 38:59.669
but is really just
a real person who's
just really trying hard

38:59.671 --> 39:03.106
<i>to get colored glue</i>
<i>and paint for the children</i>
<i>in his district,</i>

39:03.108 --> 39:05.709
and he's really gonna help them
and he's really gonna
help me.

39:05.711 --> 39:06.976
And he's really
going to help everybody

39:06.978 --> 39:08.912
with the military moon base.

39:08.914 --> 39:10.547
<i>How?</i>

39:10.549 --> 39:14.084
Well, number one,
it protects us.

39:14.086 --> 39:15.852
<i>It makes the moon,
like, one of our states.</i>

39:15.854 --> 39:17.654
<i>Keeping us safe
and non-blown up</i>

39:17.656 --> 39:20.023
So we can figure out better
restaurant and hospital service

39:20.025 --> 39:22.058
and colored glue for all.

39:22.060 --> 39:24.594
That's how it works, America.
First things first.

39:24.596 --> 39:26.496
Rock on, moon base.

39:28.767 --> 39:30.567
I hope I did as good as you.

39:30.569 --> 39:32.469
- Trust me, you did.
- Oh, thanks.

39:36.375 --> 39:38.508
You did awesome.
The crowd loved you.

39:38.510 --> 39:39.609
- I loved you.
- Yeah?

39:39.611 --> 39:40.910
Give it up
right up here.

39:40.912 --> 39:42.545
- Awesome.
- Thank you.

39:42.547 --> 39:45.782
Oh, no, control the nail.
Control the nail.

39:45.784 --> 39:48.017
- Alice, well done.
- Thank you.

39:48.019 --> 39:49.719
We should celebrate.

39:49.721 --> 39:51.621
Yeah, let's get some
liquor and start looting.

39:51.623 --> 39:54.124
No, I'm just joking.
That's a racist stereotype.

39:54.126 --> 39:55.558
But, seriously,
let's get some 40s.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.994
- Okay.
- Okay.

39:59.464 --> 40:02.766
Let's get naughty
with the 40.

40:02.768 --> 40:05.101
You know what they say, right?
You have to keep on digging.

40:05.103 --> 40:07.971
And that's exactly
what we did, the cool kids.

40:07.973 --> 40:10.673
Yeah, and look who went
on national television

40:10.675 --> 40:13.410
without having
a panic attack.

40:13.412 --> 40:16.012
Guys, we got a big poll bounce
on funding this moon base.

40:16.014 --> 40:17.480
Congrats, Howard.

40:17.482 --> 40:18.848
House Speaker wants
credit for this.

40:18.850 --> 40:20.583
Bring nail girl
to Speaker office

40:20.585 --> 40:22.519
for photo visit in a.m.

40:22.521 --> 40:24.421
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- My goodness.

40:24.423 --> 40:25.922
- Heavy duty.
- This is, like...

40:25.924 --> 40:27.857
- Yes, tomorrow.
- Heavy duty, girl.

40:27.859 --> 40:30.727
- This is crazy.
<i>- Heavy duty.</i>

40:30.729 --> 40:32.629
Well, we'll go together.
We'll all go.

40:32.631 --> 40:33.797
- Exciting.
<i>- This is it.</i>

40:33.799 --> 40:35.198
This is what
we came here for.

40:35.200 --> 40:36.800
<i>¶ My, my, my
boogie shoes... ¶</i>

40:36.802 --> 40:38.935
- It's a party.
- It's a party.

40:38.937 --> 40:40.170
It's a party.

40:43.909 --> 40:45.842
<i>¶ Oh yeah ¶</i>

40:48.780 --> 40:50.847
<i>¶ Boogie down, boogie down... ¶</i>

40:53.652 --> 40:55.718
Ow. Oh.

40:57.589 --> 41:01.458
<i>¶ I want to put on
my, my, my boogie shoes ¶</i>

41:01.460 --> 41:04.494
- Do the bump.
- Oh no.

41:04.496 --> 41:05.776
Keyshawn don't do the bump.

41:07.632 --> 41:09.899
Yeah,
let's go to Benihana's!

41:09.901 --> 41:11.568
Benihana!

41:11.570 --> 41:13.036
I want to go to Benihana's!

41:13.038 --> 41:14.938
We're going to stay here!

41:14.940 --> 41:16.639
<i>You sure?
It's going to be magical.</i>

41:18.009 --> 41:22.545
Ooh, yeah.

41:22.547 --> 41:24.147
We can do great things.

41:24.149 --> 41:25.882
- Yes.
- In politics.

41:25.884 --> 41:27.884
Okay.

41:27.886 --> 41:29.686
Oh, my God,
are you okay?

41:31.523 --> 41:34.624
I mean, I don't know you.
I don't really know you.

41:34.626 --> 41:35.925
You know, I don't know
all the details of you.

41:35.927 --> 41:37.727
You're just...
you're guarded.

41:37.729 --> 41:40.763
Yeah, I'm guarded, yeah,
you know, I mean,

41:40.765 --> 41:42.899
it's hard to let everything
that's inside out, you know?

41:42.901 --> 41:44.234
You got to stay protected
in this town.

41:44.236 --> 41:46.035
You got to keep
your cards close.

41:46.037 --> 41:48.238
I can't let down all the
important people who picked me.

41:48.240 --> 41:50.573
I can't let myself fail.

41:50.575 --> 41:53.042
What is that?

41:53.044 --> 41:55.745
That's what I went
to law school for.

41:55.747 --> 41:57.814
I wanted to be
a forest ranger.

41:57.816 --> 42:00.617
That was my
secret dream.

42:00.619 --> 42:03.653
But nobody understood.
It just seemed so wrong.

42:03.655 --> 42:08.291
- Wow. Wow, this is so cool.
- Not cool.

42:08.293 --> 42:11.661
This is really good that you're
letting it all out like this.

42:11.663 --> 42:15.265
I just got through
this broken engagement.

42:15.267 --> 42:21.070
And I just lost it all.
Now I'm damaged goods.

42:21.072 --> 42:24.040
- I'm like this broken girl.
- No, you are not.

42:24.042 --> 42:25.775
And I don't know
if I'm ever going to find

42:25.777 --> 42:27.610
- that happy life again.
- Yes, you will.

42:27.612 --> 42:28.978
- I don't know.
- Don't you wish you could

42:28.980 --> 42:31.548
- take a time machine back?
- Yes.

42:31.550 --> 42:34.617
Sixth grade might have been
the best year of my life.

42:34.619 --> 42:36.853
- Amazing campouts.
- Skating.

42:36.855 --> 42:38.788
- Man, I loved the woods.
- Yeah.

42:38.790 --> 42:41.991
And the woods loved me.
God, it feels so good to cry.

42:41.993 --> 42:44.093
- It's good to cry.
- It's good to cry.

42:44.095 --> 42:48.865
I never cry. You know,
it's like a fantastic
number two.

42:48.867 --> 42:51.701
We're better than
a time machine.

42:51.703 --> 42:56.306
Because, together,
we can make things
good again.

42:56.308 --> 42:59.042
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

42:59.044 --> 43:00.209
Yeah.

43:02.614 --> 43:04.314
You know, I was
praying for something

43:04.316 --> 43:07.850
or someone to come along.

43:07.852 --> 43:11.321
Make me be different
and be better and to
start taking chances

43:11.323 --> 43:14.123
and start being more real.

43:14.125 --> 43:19.128
And have courage, you know,
like a forest ranger would.

43:19.130 --> 43:22.899
And I think that's you.

43:22.901 --> 43:24.834
That's us.

43:26.838 --> 43:31.774
I've never met a guy who
thinks about things like this.

43:31.776 --> 43:35.812
Maybe I could be happier
than I was before.

43:40.819 --> 43:43.186
I just want you to know that
this is me really liking you,

43:43.188 --> 43:45.955
not the nail, and that I think
that the involuntary sex thing

43:45.957 --> 43:47.757
turned off when my head
hit that light.

43:47.759 --> 43:50.193
And now the voluntary
sex thing is on.

43:50.195 --> 43:54.030
I'm also volunteering.

43:54.032 --> 43:55.798
Also, don't you think we should
get to know each other

43:55.800 --> 43:57.734
a little bit better, more than
just the ranger stuff?

43:57.736 --> 43:59.068
- Okay. Well, like what?
- I don't know.

43:59.070 --> 44:00.770
Like, what are
your parents like?

44:00.772 --> 44:02.805
What are
your parents like?

44:02.807 --> 44:04.707
Well, my dad's a plumber.
My mom's a secretary.

44:04.709 --> 44:05.942
And I love them.

44:05.944 --> 44:07.377
My parents
are both tax attorneys.

44:07.379 --> 44:11.214
And I love them both.
And I hate taxes. What else?

44:11.216 --> 44:13.016
Did you have
a pet growing up?

44:13.018 --> 44:15.385
A little dog named Coconut.
What about you?

44:15.387 --> 44:17.887
Black dog
named Bojangles.

44:17.889 --> 44:19.889
- Okay, good.
- Good.

44:26.798 --> 44:29.365
- Morning, Sunshine.
- I feel great.

44:29.367 --> 44:31.367
Me, too.

44:31.369 --> 44:33.169
I can't wait to meet
the Speaker of the House

44:33.171 --> 44:35.238
and start drafting
that bill today.

44:35.240 --> 44:37.707
I can't believe
it's really happening.

44:40.245 --> 44:43.112
Here it is, the new Girl Squaw
moonbase cookie.

44:43.114 --> 44:45.214
<i>Well, my wife and two kids
are my pride and joy,</i>

44:45.216 --> 44:47.016
<i>but I love my job.</i>

44:47.018 --> 44:49.185
<i>Many heads of state have
come through this office</i>

44:49.187 --> 44:51.421
<i>and now the Grand Sacajew...</i>

44:51.423 --> 44:52.755
<i>Wea.</i>

44:52.757 --> 44:54.824
<i>Wea of the Girl things.</i>

44:54.826 --> 44:57.694
<i>- Squaws.
- Squaws, Girl Squaws.</i>

44:57.696 --> 45:02.365
I can't get enough
of these chunky gunks, Marsha.

45:02.367 --> 45:04.200
Hey, what's in these?

45:04.202 --> 45:06.135
Real macadamia nuts,
pecan bits,

45:06.137 --> 45:08.037
<i>walnut shards
and chocolate chunks.</i>

45:08.039 --> 45:09.806
<i>Which all represent
multiple warheads.</i>

45:09.808 --> 45:11.774
It's going to be
my moon base now.

45:11.776 --> 45:13.976
Your moon base?

45:13.978 --> 45:15.478
That's going to be
a catastrophe, sir,

45:15.480 --> 45:17.246
now that I've got
momentum on it,

45:17.248 --> 45:19.215
you're saying
it's your idea?

45:19.217 --> 45:21.417
That's life in the big city,
Pam Henry.

45:21.419 --> 45:25.321
- Mr. Speaker, may I introduce
Miss Eckle from my district?
- Hi.

45:25.323 --> 45:28.191
- Thank you for your help.
- Thank you, sir.

45:28.193 --> 45:32.895
You spoke to the people
last night and my moon base
is gonna pass now.

45:32.897 --> 45:36.466
Now I long dreamed
of this amazing galactic outpost

45:36.468 --> 45:39.102
protecting us all.

45:39.104 --> 45:41.838
After it was my dream.

45:41.840 --> 45:45.408
I guess everyone's dreams.
Let's take the picture.

45:45.410 --> 45:47.076
Can my friends be in it?

45:47.078 --> 45:48.745
Sure, of course.

45:48.747 --> 45:50.847
<i>Oh, you mean these friends.</i>

45:50.849 --> 45:52.749
Howard. All right.

45:52.751 --> 45:54.884
Mr. Speaker, I'm working
as a prophet

45:54.886 --> 45:57.420
for all uninsured people
as depicted

45:57.422 --> 46:01.924
in this original watercolor
made by my beautiful woman.

46:01.926 --> 46:03.159
Is that supposed to be me?

46:03.161 --> 46:05.361
That's the black you,
baby girl.

46:05.363 --> 46:07.230
- Awesome.
- Let's take the picture.

46:13.772 --> 46:16.038
Why you sitting sidesaddle?

46:16.040 --> 46:18.040
Oh, it's good to sit.

46:18.042 --> 46:20.910
I'm sorry, guys,
we just don't have
that kind of time right now.

46:20.912 --> 46:22.378
I think they're a little
confused about the event.

46:22.380 --> 46:23.813
- No, they're fine.
- Oh, yeah.

46:23.815 --> 46:25.548
Oh, you guys
must be confused.

46:25.550 --> 46:27.416
No, I thought we were
just going to attach

46:27.418 --> 46:30.319
our little emergency care bill
onto the big moon base thing,

46:30.321 --> 46:34.357
you know, little satellites
just orbiting the big moon

46:34.359 --> 46:36.526
because of my TV thing
last night.

46:36.528 --> 46:38.060
I mean, that's what
we talked about.

46:38.062 --> 46:39.929
- That wasn't confusing.
- No, it wasn't.

46:39.931 --> 46:41.931
I don't think Howard
meant that literally,

46:41.933 --> 46:44.167
- did you, Howard?
- Well, how else
would he mean it?

46:44.169 --> 46:46.402
<i>Like a lie?</i>
<i>Lying doesn't</i>
square with God.

46:46.404 --> 46:49.305
So true, you know,
that's life in Washington.

46:49.307 --> 46:53.276
Look, I got a big appointment
at the White House.

46:53.278 --> 46:56.078
And, I, um...

46:56.080 --> 46:59.182
<i>I'd love to sit
and discuss this all with you.</i>

46:59.184 --> 47:01.250
<i>I'd very much
like to come with you.</i>

47:01.252 --> 47:03.052
How can you go to the
White House and not bring me?

47:03.054 --> 47:04.453
This is my idea.

47:04.455 --> 47:07.557
It's just between
me and the president.

47:07.559 --> 47:10.026
What if we really
did get Shakira?

47:10.028 --> 47:11.594
What?

47:11.596 --> 47:14.964
<i>- What?
- What's Shakira?</i>

47:14.966 --> 47:16.432
What if we really did
do Alice's law?

47:16.434 --> 47:19.569
- Alice's law? Uh-huh.
- Alice's law?

47:19.571 --> 47:21.604
Something small,
something specific.

47:21.606 --> 47:24.440
Nothing that's big.
Nothing that would cause
a big debate.

47:24.442 --> 47:28.077
Just in addition
to military moon base
satellite defense project.

47:28.079 --> 47:30.446
<i>What does he mean,
really get Shakira?</i>

47:30.448 --> 47:32.248
Who's Shakira?

47:32.250 --> 47:33.950
Those are
interesting ideas.

47:33.952 --> 47:35.284
<i>However, we don't
have time right now.</i>

47:35.286 --> 47:37.420
She hates when anyone else
gets an idea.

47:37.422 --> 47:39.088
- Mm-hmm.
<i>- That's not true.</i>

47:39.090 --> 47:40.623
<i>I love when other people
have ideas.</i>

47:40.625 --> 47:42.558
I adore the process,
which in reality

47:42.560 --> 47:44.961
takes time
and compromise.

47:44.963 --> 47:46.963
Like a great relationship,
it never works.

47:46.965 --> 47:48.865
Not us, baby.
We gonna survive.

47:48.867 --> 47:51.200
So very sorry, guys.
Another time for sure soon.

47:51.202 --> 47:53.336
- What's happening?
- They're not gonna
help us, Marsha

47:53.338 --> 47:55.071
and you're not going
to get Shakira either.

47:55.073 --> 47:57.173
- Is that true?
<i>- That's not true.</i>

47:57.175 --> 47:59.141
- No Shakira?
<i>Oh,</i>
there will be a Shakira.

47:59.143 --> 48:00.977
Of course,
there will be Shakira.

48:00.979 --> 48:03.479
Or Shakira-related
merchandise.

48:03.481 --> 48:05.882
If I don't see
some proof right now,

48:05.884 --> 48:08.117
I'm calling a press conference
saying how Congress

48:08.119 --> 48:10.953
boned the Girl Squaws
and I'll fuck shit up.

48:10.955 --> 48:13.489
Why don't we just
calm down, Marsha?

48:13.491 --> 48:15.391
Get off me, Judas.

48:15.393 --> 48:17.026
Sound the Squaw alarm.

48:17.028 --> 48:18.494
No, no, don't sound
the Squaw alarm.

48:20.598 --> 48:22.331
Mr. Speaker, breathe.

48:22.333 --> 48:25.234
Breathe. Mr. Speaker, breath.

48:25.236 --> 48:27.103
I know the Heimlich.
Watch out.

48:27.105 --> 48:28.271
Oh, my...

48:31.609 --> 48:33.910
Ah!

48:33.912 --> 48:36.312
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Speaker,
we'll do it your way!

48:36.314 --> 48:38.414
- You're caving?
- Mr. Speaker is choking!

48:38.416 --> 48:41.117
- Get help!
- EMT's on the way!

48:41.119 --> 48:42.652
<i>This man is choking
on your issue.</i>

48:44.555 --> 48:46.522
We have to clear the airway.

48:51.963 --> 48:53.362
<i>Do something.</i>

48:53.364 --> 48:55.431
He doesn't want it.
He doesn't want it.

48:55.433 --> 48:59.135
Oh, my God, he's dying.
He's dying.

48:59.137 --> 49:02.405
- Howard, rip open his shirt.
- Okay.

49:04.976 --> 49:07.410
Clear!

49:07.412 --> 49:09.145
- Here, let me try.
- No, I got it.

49:09.147 --> 49:10.479
- No, wait, he's my boss.
- I'm doing it.

49:10.481 --> 49:11.948
Plus I've always
wanted to do this.

49:11.950 --> 49:13.716
Okay. God.

49:13.718 --> 49:15.518
<i>- Let me try it!
- You're doing it...</i>

49:15.520 --> 49:18.955
<i>- Wait!
- Let him help you!</i>

49:18.957 --> 49:21.290
He was my boss
before he was your boss.

49:21.292 --> 49:22.959
It's broken.
It's broken.

49:22.961 --> 49:24.527
I'll save him.
It's not broken.

49:24.529 --> 49:26.662
- You're not
doing it right.
- Ah!

49:26.664 --> 49:30.433
Stay with us, Mr. Speaker.
You're my mentor.

49:30.435 --> 49:32.134
We're not gonna lose him!

50:01.332 --> 50:02.565
Wow.

50:06.304 --> 50:09.338
What's going on?
Why are you watching this?

50:09.340 --> 50:11.374
- Alice is on TV.
- What?

50:11.376 --> 50:12.708
We were going
to watch "Terminator."

50:12.710 --> 50:14.243
- Brenda, can you move?
- I made popcorn.

50:14.245 --> 50:15.644
- I know.
- I slept over.

50:15.646 --> 50:19.148
Brenda, I told you that
there's a 55-45% chance

50:19.150 --> 50:21.484
<i>that I couldn't get over Alice.
Now that's going to 70-30.</i>

50:21.486 --> 50:24.253
- She's amazing.
- Amazing?

50:24.255 --> 50:29.125
- She has a damaged head.
- Okay. 65-35.

50:29.127 --> 50:31.394
But I might still be
in love with her.

50:31.396 --> 50:34.330
Your numbers
are garbage to me.

50:34.332 --> 50:36.432
<i>Call me, though,
because I don't know</i>

50:36.434 --> 50:39.114
- <i> how this is</i>
gonna turn out.

50:40.638 --> 50:42.638
<i>This man that I hoped...</i>

50:42.640 --> 50:46.142
I hope and pray to him.

50:46.144 --> 50:48.778
I just wanted to let you know
how horrible I feel about what
happened

50:48.780 --> 50:50.713
and if that defibrillator
hadn't broken,

50:50.715 --> 50:53.249
- it would have...
- It wasn't the defibrillator.

50:53.251 --> 50:56.052
He choked to death.

50:56.054 --> 51:00.689
But I asked God for help
fulfilling big shoes of...

51:00.691 --> 51:04.460
What is she doing
here with her weird
band of confederates?

51:04.462 --> 51:08.230
Oh, I'm sure she just
feels bad about yesterday.

51:08.232 --> 51:11.100
- She's just...
- Yeah, go manage it.

51:11.102 --> 51:13.302
Okay, I got it managed.
Take it off your mind.

51:13.304 --> 51:15.144
- I've got it.
- Thank you. Good.

51:16.407 --> 51:21.410
Buck McCoy was a cold...
He was my mentor.

51:21.412 --> 51:25.347
Are you still being weird?
Because if you can't stop

51:25.349 --> 51:27.750
being weird,
get away from me.

51:27.752 --> 51:30.086
Why? Feeling guilty
for some reason?

51:30.088 --> 51:32.154
What are you talking about?
Why should I feel guilty?

51:32.156 --> 51:34.223
I saw you unplug the wire.

51:34.225 --> 51:36.859
That is
an outrageous accusation.

51:36.861 --> 51:39.695
- Did anyone else see?
- No, just me.

51:39.697 --> 51:42.598
I'm the only one
who's in on the murder.

51:42.600 --> 51:44.500
Fate gave us a break,
for God's sake.

51:44.502 --> 51:46.635
Don't get all crumbly
on me.

51:46.637 --> 51:48.571
I need to practice
my eulogy, Edwin.

51:48.573 --> 51:51.340
This is my moment.
You need to support me.

51:55.213 --> 51:56.812
He was my mentor.

51:59.617 --> 52:03.185
Hi, can you guys
move over?

52:05.256 --> 52:06.388
Thanks.

52:08.659 --> 52:11.127
- What?
- Get away from me.

52:11.129 --> 52:12.661
I cannot believe
I trusted you.

52:12.663 --> 52:14.663
You were supposed
to take care of me.

52:14.665 --> 52:16.632
So I sort of lied
a little bit, okay?

52:16.634 --> 52:18.868
And I didn't understand
what I was doing.

52:18.870 --> 52:22.171
And, you know, I got caught up
in the system, yes.

52:22.173 --> 52:24.140
But I got inspired
by you.

52:24.142 --> 52:25.774
And now I might lose my job.

52:25.776 --> 52:30.846
So what?

52:30.848 --> 52:32.581
Was that something
about the nail?

52:32.583 --> 52:34.850
- Yes. God.
- Let me get that removed, okay?

52:34.852 --> 52:36.418
We have great
healthcare in Congress

52:36.420 --> 52:38.587
and I could give you
my surgery voucher.

52:38.589 --> 52:40.422
Is that like
a Shakira voucher

52:40.424 --> 52:41.657
or is it a real voucher?

52:41.659 --> 52:43.559
That's a real voucher.

52:43.561 --> 52:45.161
Well,
what about my friends?

52:45.163 --> 52:46.829
Yeah, we'll take
some of that, amigo.

52:46.831 --> 52:49.465
What? Do I look like I'm made
out of vouchers over here?

52:49.467 --> 52:52.835
I have one
major surgery voucher,
and I'm offering it to you.

52:52.837 --> 52:55.804
I can't get this thing out
until everyone can get
help, okay?

52:55.806 --> 52:57.206
I'm thinking bigger.

52:58.910 --> 53:01.577
That's awesome, Alice,
but you're never going to get

53:01.579 --> 53:02.811
that bill passed
until you're dead.

53:02.813 --> 53:04.547
Either from that
thing in your head

53:04.549 --> 53:07.249
or from your old age, okay?
And I care about you a lot.

53:07.251 --> 53:09.618
And I don't want
to see you die, okay?

53:09.620 --> 53:13.222
There's got to be some way
or else my country
totally sucks.

53:13.224 --> 53:15.324
It's imposs...

53:15.326 --> 53:18.694
It's impossible unless
something extremely dramatic
happens very soon.

53:18.696 --> 53:20.296
And the Speaker of the House
just choked to death.

53:20.298 --> 53:22.765
So I think we're out
of drama right now.

53:27.672 --> 53:30.339
Watch this.

53:30.341 --> 53:31.674
What are you doing?

53:31.676 --> 53:33.509
Wait, no. Stop.
Stop. Stop it.

53:33.511 --> 53:38.480
- This man was a great hero.
- No, wait, stop, stop.

53:41.352 --> 53:42.484
What?

53:43.921 --> 53:47.790
What an American hero
this man was! Come on!

53:47.792 --> 53:48.991
Oh, God.

53:56.801 --> 54:00.869
- Come on, people!
- Thank you.

54:06.844 --> 54:09.645
Thank you.
Thank you, bless you.

54:09.647 --> 54:12.881
I know, I know
he was a great man.

54:12.883 --> 54:15.384
I know him and I loved him, too,
and he changed my life.

54:15.386 --> 54:18.420
- Thank you.
- Hugging the widow.

54:18.422 --> 54:20.823
No. The widow hugs me.

54:20.825 --> 54:24.860
And I'm going to tell the truth
about you right now.

54:27.965 --> 54:29.798
I just want
to give you a hug.

54:29.800 --> 54:31.934
No. She's going to tell
the truth about Buck now.

54:31.936 --> 54:33.502
She's not going to tell
the truth about Buck.

54:33.504 --> 54:34.937
She doesn't even know Buck.

54:34.939 --> 54:36.438
You don't know anything
about Buck either.

54:36.440 --> 54:39.308
You just wanted his job
and now you have it.

54:39.310 --> 54:40.442
Now, sit.

54:52.623 --> 54:54.623
What a sad, sad
occasion it is that has

54:54.625 --> 54:57.726
brought us together today.

54:57.728 --> 55:00.763
And you're probably
wondering who I am.

55:00.765 --> 55:03.699
Well, I'm nobody.
I'm just a regular citizen

55:03.701 --> 55:08.771
that Congressman McCoy
took the time to see...

55:08.773 --> 55:11.440
on the last day
of his life.

55:11.442 --> 55:15.444
Because he was
a generous

55:15.446 --> 55:17.579
and caring man.

55:19.884 --> 55:22.484
I was there.

55:22.486 --> 55:25.688
I was there when he died...

55:25.690 --> 55:28.557
trying to Heimlich
the cookie chunks

55:28.559 --> 55:31.760
from the Speaker's throat,
but we just couldn't Heimlich

55:31.762 --> 55:33.362
enough and I blame myself.

55:33.364 --> 55:35.397
Don't blame yourself.

55:35.399 --> 55:37.900
I do. No, I do.
I blame myself.

55:41.038 --> 55:44.039
I'm a woman with a nail
in my head that I cannot afford

55:44.041 --> 55:46.742
to fix, which might hemorrhage
and kill me at any time.

55:51.115 --> 55:55.551
But he was a man
who I have learned

55:55.553 --> 56:00.422
happily crushed every piece
of health legislation

56:00.424 --> 56:03.926
that he could get his hands
on during his 31-year career.

56:03.928 --> 56:09.865
But do you know what
his last dying words were?

56:09.867 --> 56:11.900
I do.

56:11.902 --> 56:14.536
Because he said them to me.

56:14.538 --> 56:16.705
He said...

56:16.707 --> 56:18.674
he said, "Alice...

56:18.676 --> 56:22.111
<i>Alice, if a congressman</i>

56:22.113 --> 56:24.113
had a nail in his head,

56:24.115 --> 56:27.516
Congress would pay
to have it removed."

56:27.518 --> 56:29.451
That's what he said.

56:29.453 --> 56:32.921
<i>Congress would pay
to have it removed.</i>

56:32.923 --> 56:35.724
Why can't you
and all Americans be shown

56:35.726 --> 56:38.427
that same human decency?
Why?

56:38.429 --> 56:40.496
<i>Why can't we?</i>

56:40.498 --> 56:43.499
This is not fair." he said.
And he said,

56:43.501 --> 56:45.868
"Let's just
forget about the moon base.

56:45.870 --> 56:49.171
Forget about it. We have
plenty of defense already.

56:49.173 --> 56:52.141
And let's pass the emergency
healthcare law instead."

56:53.811 --> 56:57.813
He reversed his position.

56:57.815 --> 56:59.581
It's true.

56:59.583 --> 57:02.151
I knew
he always had it in him.

57:02.153 --> 57:04.853
My husband was
a big-hearted man.

57:04.855 --> 57:07.990
Yes, he was.
Yes, he was.

57:07.992 --> 57:10.492
Let's do this.

57:10.494 --> 57:13.462
This was
his dying wish.

57:13.464 --> 57:17.666
Let's do it for Buck McCoy.

57:17.668 --> 57:19.868
Yes!

57:49.500 --> 57:50.666
Tell us about your injury.

57:50.668 --> 57:52.000
What else did Buck say
before he died?

57:52.002 --> 57:53.569
Were you attacked
with a nail gun?

57:53.571 --> 57:55.771
- Where's Howard?
- There he is!

57:55.773 --> 57:58.574
There he is!

57:58.576 --> 58:00.809
<i>Howard!</i>

58:00.811 --> 58:02.778
Did he embrace legalizing
medical marijuana?

58:02.780 --> 58:04.012
And what about stem cells?

58:04.014 --> 58:07.783
I don't know.
I don't know.

58:07.785 --> 58:10.219
Maybe yes
on the medical marijuana.

58:28.138 --> 58:30.772
How was that for dramatic?

58:30.774 --> 58:35.611
You were amazing.
That was like political karate.

58:35.613 --> 58:38.614
I mean, you hijacked the legacy
of a major political career

58:38.616 --> 58:42.751
and then you just transformed
the chi over to our cause.

58:42.753 --> 58:44.786
- I know, right?
- You're inspiring.

58:44.788 --> 58:47.823
You are a fantastic liar,
and for all the right reasons.

58:47.825 --> 58:51.059
Oh, honey, you taught me
how to lie to get what I want
because you did it to me.

58:51.061 --> 58:52.761
- But you're the better liar.
- It's you.

58:52.763 --> 58:54.296
You're the best liar.
You're the better liar.

58:54.298 --> 58:56.598
- No, no.
- You are the better liar.

58:56.600 --> 58:59.801
You're a better liar.
Like, top tier liar.

59:01.805 --> 59:03.906
Are you still mad at me?

59:03.908 --> 59:07.309
No. I can see you
were stuck in a situation
that wasn't really you.

59:07.311 --> 59:10.212
I definitely think
we inspire each other.

59:10.214 --> 59:11.880
And I think
I'm in love with you.

59:13.851 --> 59:15.551
I think I'm in love
with you, too.

59:15.553 --> 59:17.052
Alice.

59:17.054 --> 59:19.821
You were filled
with the divine spirit.

59:19.823 --> 59:21.657
You know what?
You touched the magic.

59:21.659 --> 59:22.891
<i>And that ain't easy,
believe me.</i>

59:22.893 --> 59:24.293
I have been
on many a pulpit.

59:24.295 --> 59:26.562
And I have oft...
But you soared.

59:26.564 --> 59:28.030
Couldn't have
did it better myself.

59:29.934 --> 59:31.733
Alice, everyone
wants to see you.

59:31.735 --> 59:33.235
It's so exciting.

59:33.237 --> 59:35.237
Congress guy Pam Henry
wants to see you,

59:35.239 --> 59:38.173
but in a bad, scary way.

59:38.175 --> 59:41.143
- That is scary.
- Why is that scary?

59:41.145 --> 59:43.345
You smacked down on the most
important member of the House

59:43.347 --> 59:45.814
after we killed the other most
important member of the House.

59:45.816 --> 59:47.316
And Pam Henry plays rough.

59:47.318 --> 59:49.217
She's a take-no-prisoners
kind of gal, okay?

59:49.219 --> 59:51.653
She's going to do us
and smear us across
the floor.

59:51.655 --> 59:54.590
I'm just saying,
it's not going to be
good times, Beach Boys.

59:54.592 --> 59:57.025
Okay. Well, bring it
'cause we can take her.

59:57.027 --> 59:58.293
- Let's go.
- Yeah...

59:58.295 --> 01:00:01.363
Maybe... maybe we can.

01:00:01.365 --> 01:00:04.299
<i>You know, I want to say
that I love you.</i>

01:00:04.301 --> 01:00:06.368
I want to be the kind
of man who stays here

01:00:06.370 --> 01:00:09.171
and fights for you
and all the sad,

01:00:09.173 --> 01:00:10.872
injured people
without money.

01:00:10.874 --> 01:00:12.374
You're a good man.

01:00:12.376 --> 01:00:15.611
- Thanks, Norm.
- Howard, what are you doing?

01:00:15.613 --> 01:00:17.646
Look, it's just kind
of a gigantic deal,

01:00:17.648 --> 01:00:18.981
you know, when you go
against your party

01:00:18.983 --> 01:00:20.282
and all the big bosses
who got you here.

01:00:20.284 --> 01:00:21.883
So I'm just going
to need to take a minute

01:00:21.885 --> 01:00:23.352
and think about this.

01:00:23.354 --> 01:00:24.920
Wait, you can't
just leave.

01:00:24.922 --> 01:00:27.089
You have to introduce
our bill in the new session.

01:00:27.091 --> 01:00:29.758
And you've got to be
with me and stuff.

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.960
Howard, come on.
We're a team.

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:34.229
Listen,
I am going to be there.

01:00:34.231 --> 01:00:36.632
I swear on my life.

01:00:36.634 --> 01:00:37.966
Howard, Pam Henry
wants to see you,

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:39.801
and you better come
right now!

01:00:39.803 --> 01:00:42.738
You tell her that I'm going
to be there, all right?

01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:45.374
I swear on my life!

01:00:50.347 --> 01:00:52.648
Behold, I would
wander far away.

01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:55.283
I would remain
in the wilderness.
Psalm 55.

01:00:55.285 --> 01:00:59.154
Some folks go crazier
than a shithouse rat
and let you down.

01:00:59.156 --> 01:01:02.658
Aunt Veknuckle, '87.

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:04.326
He's a complicated,
beautiful man

01:01:04.328 --> 01:01:06.828
and he is not going
to let me down.

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:10.899
As National Grand Sacajawea
of all Girl Squaws,

01:01:10.901 --> 01:01:13.869
I apologize
for the total bummer

01:01:13.871 --> 01:01:16.738
of not getting Shakira
like I said.

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:21.076
But as payback to the guys
who lied and let us down,

01:01:21.078 --> 01:01:24.813
I propose that we direct
our efforts to Congress

01:01:24.815 --> 01:01:26.748
to get the nail out
for Alice

01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:29.317
and all Americans
in such trouble.

01:01:29.319 --> 01:01:30.952
This is Alice.

01:01:30.954 --> 01:01:33.055
Let's welcome her
to the Squaws.

01:01:36.727 --> 01:01:38.393
<i>If you're on
a Girl Squaw campout</i>

01:01:38.395 --> 01:01:41.463
and an ax gets imbedded
in your femur

01:01:41.465 --> 01:01:45.167
or your face is badly burned
in a s'mores accident,

01:01:45.169 --> 01:01:46.868
you will be protected
by this bill

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:50.238
even if your family
is badly insured.

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:53.809
And we have a new special
edition cookie to replace

01:01:53.811 --> 01:01:56.411
the discontinued
hazardous moon base cookies.

01:01:56.413 --> 01:01:58.180
It's the Alice
Nail in the Head cookie.

01:01:58.182 --> 01:01:59.881
Soft and non-chuckable.

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:01.950
We will use these cookies
to build support

01:02:01.952 --> 01:02:03.251
for our healthcare bill.

01:02:03.253 --> 01:02:07.823
- Here, here.
- Here, here.

01:02:07.825 --> 01:02:13.061
<i>¶ Let your colors shine ¶</i>

01:02:13.063 --> 01:02:16.765
<i>¶ Let your colors
shine ¶</i>

01:02:16.767 --> 01:02:19.735
<i>¶ Come on, it's raining
rainbow sprinkles ¶</i>

01:02:19.737 --> 01:02:22.304
<i>¶ It's raining
rainbow sprinkles ¶</i>

01:02:22.306 --> 01:02:25.440
<i>¶ Let your colors shine. ¶</i>

01:02:28.212 --> 01:02:30.479
Damn it. Girl Squaws
are knocking the moon base

01:02:30.481 --> 01:02:32.514
- literally off
the front pages.
- And the blogs.

01:02:32.516 --> 01:02:34.783
And they're camping
in front of the Capitol,
if you can believe that.

01:02:34.785 --> 01:02:37.219
Females are running nine to one
in favor of the Alice bill

01:02:37.221 --> 01:02:38.887
- over the moon base.
- We got to do something.

01:02:38.889 --> 01:02:40.288
Well, I did deploy
the poison oak spray.

01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:42.090
We're not animals.

01:02:42.092 --> 01:02:44.092
Well, we have to do something
to knock them off at the knees.

01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:45.994
- It's so wrong.
- Why don't we just kill them?

01:02:45.996 --> 01:02:49.264
Hey, that topic's over.
Let's focus.

01:02:49.266 --> 01:02:52.467
Do they really have
a viral video out against
the moon base?

01:02:52.469 --> 01:02:54.169
Yes, that is true.

01:02:54.171 --> 01:02:56.338
It is very popular
and it's doing a lot
of damage.

01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:57.773
Curses.

01:02:57.775 --> 01:02:59.241
She's got a nail
in her head

01:02:59.243 --> 01:03:01.376
and her family's got
a piece of crap HMO.

01:03:01.378 --> 01:03:04.379
We have no choice
but to perform unlicensed
home surgery.

01:03:04.381 --> 01:03:07.415
Scalpel, please.
Quickly, quickly.

01:03:11.455 --> 01:03:13.088
She's hemorrhaging!

01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:17.793
But at least
we have a moon base!

01:03:20.831 --> 01:03:22.397
<i>Well, they can camp
on YouTube all they want.</i>

01:03:22.399 --> 01:03:25.167
I'll make sure nobody
will introduce their bill.

01:03:25.169 --> 01:03:27.936
Howard's in hiding.
No way he'll help them.

01:03:27.938 --> 01:03:29.437
What about the pro healthcare
guy across the aisle?

01:03:29.439 --> 01:03:31.072
Oh, they're pushovers.

01:03:31.074 --> 01:03:32.808
I already threatened
to cut public housing

01:03:32.810 --> 01:03:34.576
and dangle
the multicultural
rainbow package

01:03:34.578 --> 01:03:37.078
and they were so freaking
happy to take it,
it was pathetic.

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:38.480
Yeah, but these Squaws,
they're tough.

01:03:38.482 --> 01:03:40.842
We need something
strong to stop them.

01:03:42.085 --> 01:03:43.485
Hold it.

01:03:45.856 --> 01:03:47.222
I've got something.

01:03:54.431 --> 01:03:56.431
<i>There's pasta primavera
right there.</i>

01:03:56.433 --> 01:03:58.533
<i>Extra spicy.</i>

01:03:58.535 --> 01:04:00.869
<i>Some people want us
to raise taxes</i>

01:04:00.871 --> 01:04:03.071
<i>to pay
for socialist medicine.</i>

01:04:03.073 --> 01:04:06.308
<i>Maybe these people</i>
<i>are bad news because</i>
<i>they're lesbians.</i>

01:04:06.310 --> 01:04:08.210
<i>Marsha Weber
is the number two leader</i>

01:04:08.212 --> 01:04:10.278
<i>of the movement
behind Alice Eckle,</i>

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:13.615
<i>raised in</i>
<i>a family lesbian cult</i>
<i>led by this woman.</i>

01:04:13.617 --> 01:04:16.284
<i>Committed to spreading
lesbianism door to door</i>

01:04:16.286 --> 01:04:18.620
<i>by other Girl Squaws
of America.</i>

01:04:18.622 --> 01:04:22.924
<i>Marsha Weber has been
an influence for many years.</i>

01:04:22.926 --> 01:04:24.392
<i>Stop the gay poison.</i>

01:04:24.394 --> 01:04:27.195
<i>Tell your representatives
you are against</i>

01:04:27.197 --> 01:04:29.531
<i>the Catastrophic Care bill.</i>

01:04:29.533 --> 01:04:31.466
Listen up, girls.

01:04:31.468 --> 01:04:34.369
More calamine lotion
for the poison oak
has just arrived.

01:04:34.371 --> 01:04:36.304
You can get some
at the first aid tent.

01:04:36.306 --> 01:04:37.906
<i>- ...they're lesbians.</i>
- I don't know.

01:04:37.908 --> 01:04:39.341
It might be true.
How do I know?

01:04:39.343 --> 01:04:41.409
Hopefully, that won't
hurt us too much.

01:04:41.411 --> 01:04:43.945
I mean you be you, Marsha.
That's what I mean.
I support you.

01:04:43.947 --> 01:04:45.647
Tell us about the tragedy
of your gayness.

01:04:48.619 --> 01:04:50.652
Don't hold my hand
anymore, Marsha.

01:04:50.654 --> 01:04:53.421
Hey, come on.
Stick together, you guys.

01:04:53.423 --> 01:04:55.457
I will not rest
until I hunt down

01:04:55.459 --> 01:04:57.959
whoever made this deplorable ad
slamming a nine-year-old girl.

01:04:57.961 --> 01:04:59.661
It was disgusting.

01:04:59.663 --> 01:05:01.930
Though in no way
do I support child lesbianism.

01:05:01.932 --> 01:05:04.332
Thank you.

01:05:04.334 --> 01:05:07.903
- I need a new sign. I'm lost.
- We're all lost.

01:05:07.905 --> 01:05:09.471
Congress is back,
but Howard's not.

01:05:09.473 --> 01:05:11.473
Pam Henry either
bribed or scared anyone

01:05:11.475 --> 01:05:13.541
who might
sponsor our law.

01:05:13.543 --> 01:05:16.578
I keep blacking out
for a second.

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:18.380
Thanks.

01:05:18.382 --> 01:05:20.448
Marsha, have your trackers
found anything on Howard?

01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:22.951
They picked up his trail
through credit card
transactions,

01:05:22.953 --> 01:05:24.953
- but they lost it
in Virginia.
- God!

01:05:35.332 --> 01:05:37.332
I understood
the word "Howard."

01:05:37.334 --> 01:05:39.134
Alice!

01:05:39.136 --> 01:05:41.703
Your super cute boyfriend's
here to see you.

01:05:41.705 --> 01:05:43.571
Howard.

01:05:45.709 --> 01:05:48.109
Scott.

01:05:48.111 --> 01:05:49.411
What are you doing here?

01:05:49.413 --> 01:05:51.146
Just bringing you
some comfort food.

01:05:51.148 --> 01:05:53.515
Chili cheeseburger
with salsa fries.

01:05:53.517 --> 01:05:54.716
They might be
a little cold,

01:05:54.718 --> 01:05:57.986
but they still
taste like home.

01:05:57.988 --> 01:05:59.387
Alice, don't you
miss home?

01:05:59.389 --> 01:06:01.122
Of course I do.

01:06:01.124 --> 01:06:03.058
Alice, I'm sorry,
I screwed up.

01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:05.994
You know,
you're a lot of woman
for a man to handle.

01:06:05.996 --> 01:06:07.963
And, honestly,
I wasn't up for it before.

01:06:07.965 --> 01:06:09.597
But I am now.
I'm so proud of you.

01:06:09.599 --> 01:06:11.700
I just...
I really am.

01:06:11.702 --> 01:06:14.002
Come on, we can be
at Rusty's in 10 hours.

01:06:14.004 --> 01:06:15.537
Scott, this is a lot
to take in right now.

01:06:15.539 --> 01:06:17.038
It's freaking me out.

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:18.406
Okay, well, I don't want
to freak you out.

01:06:18.408 --> 01:06:19.674
Just take your time.
I'm here for you.

01:06:19.676 --> 01:06:21.609
I know it's going
to get rough.

01:06:21.611 --> 01:06:24.512
Tomorrow's Harris polls
shows you dead even
with the opposition.

01:06:24.514 --> 01:06:27.015
Wait a minute. What?

01:06:27.017 --> 01:06:29.417
Nobody knows
tomorrow's Harris numbers
unless they're in Congress.

01:06:29.419 --> 01:06:32.554
- Did somebody put you up
to this to mess with me?
-<i> No, no way.</i>

01:06:32.556 --> 01:06:35.724
One of your little girl spies
told me about the polls
when I got here.

01:06:35.726 --> 01:06:40.195
- It's a lie! He...
- Hey, you shut your mouth!

01:06:40.197 --> 01:06:43.031
That's not even true.
We talked for a minute. Go.

01:06:44.701 --> 01:06:47.235
All right.
Pam Henry brought me here.

01:06:47.237 --> 01:06:48.737
I'm not a very good liar,
Alice.

01:06:48.739 --> 01:06:50.572
But, look, they offered
to make me post commander

01:06:50.574 --> 01:06:53.108
and fund the entire squadron
for photon tasers and Oakleys

01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:54.476
if I could just get you
to come home.

01:06:54.478 --> 01:06:56.011
And I thought,
that's not a bad thing.

01:06:56.013 --> 01:06:58.580
- I want you home.
- Those rat bastards.

01:06:58.582 --> 01:07:00.615
What about
my injury, Scott?

01:07:00.617 --> 01:07:04.119
What about all the people here
that I'm trying to help?

01:07:04.121 --> 01:07:05.687
Well...

01:07:05.689 --> 01:07:09.424
Where is the guy
who will just think
bigger than just himself?

01:07:09.426 --> 01:07:11.026
That's me.
I'm right here.

01:07:11.028 --> 01:07:12.794
I want to be that guy,
Alice, please.

01:07:12.796 --> 01:07:14.396
Give me another shot.
I can be that guy.

01:07:14.398 --> 01:07:15.563
I want to give you
foot massages.

01:07:15.565 --> 01:07:17.565
I want to take baths
with you.

01:07:17.567 --> 01:07:19.634
I want to take your issue
to the City Council
or something.

01:07:19.636 --> 01:07:21.302
I want you back,
nail and all.

01:07:21.304 --> 01:07:23.271
- Please...
- I miss you.

01:07:23.273 --> 01:07:25.206
- I love you more
than anything.
- Please don't.

01:07:25.208 --> 01:07:28.543
- My precious
honeycomb cluster.
- God.

01:07:28.545 --> 01:07:30.211
- Honeycomb cluster.
- Stop.

01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:32.180
Honeycomb cluster.
Honeycomb...

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:39.554
I learned it for you.

01:07:39.556 --> 01:07:42.157
I want to support you.
What do you need?

01:07:42.159 --> 01:07:44.092
<i>She needs a sponsor!</i>

01:07:44.094 --> 01:07:45.827
Guys, please,
can I have a second?

01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:47.829
It's true.
I need a sponsor.

01:07:47.831 --> 01:07:50.398
Oh, my God,
what are you hooked on?
Coke? Meth?

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.500
Not a rehab sponsor,
a sponsor for my law.

01:07:52.502 --> 01:07:54.069
Nobody in Congress
will introduce it.

01:07:54.071 --> 01:07:55.537
Our only hope's
disappeared.

01:07:55.539 --> 01:07:57.572
Our trackers lost
his trail in Virginia.

01:07:57.574 --> 01:07:58.840
Let me help.

01:07:58.842 --> 01:08:00.675
What's this guy's name?

01:08:00.677 --> 01:08:02.544
Howard Birdwell.

01:08:02.546 --> 01:08:04.479
I can probably use
the brotherhood of troopers

01:08:04.481 --> 01:08:06.481
to find
this Howard Birdwell.

01:08:06.483 --> 01:08:08.349
Scotty, if you would do that,
I will be grateful to you

01:08:08.351 --> 01:08:09.751
for the rest of my life.

01:08:09.753 --> 01:08:13.254
The rest
of our lives together.

01:08:13.256 --> 01:08:14.823
That's how
it's going to be.

01:08:14.825 --> 01:08:16.591
I'm going to find
this guy, all right?

01:08:18.862 --> 01:08:21.563
You should marry him
even if he does bring
Howard back.

01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:23.298
- He is a dreamboat.
- Give me that hat.

01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:25.433
Don't you have water rations
to deliver or something?

01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:28.770
Breaker 1-9, this is
Officer Scott Beardsley,
Indiana State Trooper.

01:08:28.772 --> 01:08:32.173
Calling all my brothers for a 20
on Congressman Howard Birdwell.

01:08:32.175 --> 01:08:34.676
Government plates G9575.

01:08:34.678 --> 01:08:38.246
Activate LoJack,
alpha bravo 6-4-9er. Over.

01:08:38.247 --> 01:08:39.814
<i>Roger, Beardsley. Over.</i>

01:08:39.816 --> 01:08:41.850
Copy that.
How you doing, ladies?

01:09:06.643 --> 01:09:08.475
Where's Howard Birdwell?

01:09:27.264 --> 01:09:29.197
It's best
if you wait here.

01:09:34.871 --> 01:09:36.837
Hey, Howard.

01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:51.419
I'm Congressman Birdwell.
Is there a problem, Officer?

01:09:51.421 --> 01:09:54.656
What is this,
like a sex cult thing
or what's the deal here?

01:09:54.658 --> 01:09:57.325
It's a men's
spiritual workshop.

01:09:57.327 --> 01:09:58.826
How can I help you?

01:10:00.564 --> 01:10:03.198
Alice needs
you to introduce
her bill tomorrow

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:05.600
- and I'm here to get you...
- No, no. I can't go.
I can't leave now.

01:10:05.602 --> 01:10:07.335
What do you mean?
She... why?

01:10:07.337 --> 01:10:08.803
Well, I came here
to find my core

01:10:08.805 --> 01:10:10.872
and I'm only two-thirds
of the way there.

01:10:10.874 --> 01:10:12.440
I have no idea
what that means,

01:10:12.442 --> 01:10:14.709
but can that happen, like,
in the next half hour?

01:10:14.711 --> 01:10:16.878
I am going
as fast as I can.

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:18.780
They're not handing out
cores left and right

01:10:18.782 --> 01:10:20.348
like they are at
those other workshops.

01:10:20.350 --> 01:10:21.716
This is the real deal.

01:10:21.718 --> 01:10:22.984
And a lot depends
on what happens

01:10:22.986 --> 01:10:24.352
in the Circle
of Shaman Fire.

01:10:24.354 --> 01:10:25.887
The circle of what?

01:10:25.889 --> 01:10:27.689
It's a special test
where...

01:10:31.628 --> 01:10:33.228
Hey, let him go!

01:10:34.431 --> 01:10:35.997
This is why he's here.

01:10:46.443 --> 01:10:47.942
Don't mess him up.

01:10:47.944 --> 01:10:50.478
Back off! I need to see
what I'm made of!

01:10:56.686 --> 01:10:59.554
Get him in the legs!
Go the legs! Get up!

01:10:59.556 --> 01:11:01.489
Feint to the head,
go for the body!

01:11:01.491 --> 01:11:02.757
Feint to the head!

01:11:07.264 --> 01:11:08.529
I can't watch you
get hurt, buddy.

01:11:08.531 --> 01:11:09.611
You're needed
in Washington.

01:11:10.867 --> 01:11:12.433
Let me do this!

01:11:12.435 --> 01:11:13.935
It's dangerous to go
until he earns

01:11:13.937 --> 01:11:16.337
the trophy of his power.

01:11:17.841 --> 01:11:19.507
All right,
you know what?

01:11:19.509 --> 01:11:21.409
I've never been to one
of these things before,

01:11:21.411 --> 01:11:23.011
but I think you need
to just take those yourself

01:11:23.013 --> 01:11:24.979
without anyone's permission,
without this antler guy

01:11:24.981 --> 01:11:27.815
or any of these loin cloths.
You do it on your terms.

01:11:27.817 --> 01:11:29.897
That's how you become
your own man.

01:11:34.824 --> 01:11:36.858
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:11:54.978 --> 01:11:57.345
That's right, man!
That's how it's done!

01:11:58.982 --> 01:12:02.350
Yeah! Get him!

01:12:08.491 --> 01:12:10.558
This is a big setback
for all of us

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:13.061
and a huge blow
for me personally.

01:12:13.063 --> 01:12:16.531
We love you, Alice!

01:12:16.533 --> 01:12:20.802
And your love definitely hasn't
let me down even if my guy did.

01:12:20.804 --> 01:12:22.704
But I think we're going
to have to settle

01:12:22.706 --> 01:12:25.773
for what we've accomplished
without introducing our bill.

01:12:28.345 --> 01:12:31.346
<i>I am the fire warrior!</i>

01:12:32.749 --> 01:12:35.350
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:42.490
Howard.
Howard.

01:12:42.492 --> 01:12:46.494
I am the fire warrior!

01:13:09.853 --> 01:13:14.122
I'm Howard Birdwell,
Congress Man!

01:13:23.533 --> 01:13:25.833
I have in my hand
a pair of moose balls.

01:13:25.835 --> 01:13:28.703
They give me the power
to announce that I'll be
resigning from my party

01:13:28.705 --> 01:13:31.906
and becoming Independent,
which will probably
destroy my career!

01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:33.708
Wow.

01:13:33.710 --> 01:13:34.942
Yeah!

01:13:37.414 --> 01:13:41.115
Tomorrow I will introduce
on the floor of Congress

01:13:41.117 --> 01:13:46.120
a bill that provides
basic emergency healthcare

01:13:46.122 --> 01:13:48.556
for all people.

01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:58.599
Especially this woman
who put a nail through
my heart.

01:14:05.909 --> 01:14:08.543
Hey, hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no!

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:13.080
- Scott.
- She's my girl,
all right?

01:14:13.082 --> 01:14:15.216
I got you for her bill.
That's it. No extracurricular.

01:14:15.218 --> 01:14:18.052
- Scott, please.
- Hey, that's not right!

01:14:18.054 --> 01:14:19.754
<i>He's a fire warrior!</i>

01:14:19.756 --> 01:14:21.756
You're actually
with this antelope?

01:14:21.758 --> 01:14:24.058
This guy that I found
running around the woods
in a diaper?

01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:25.927
That's your guy?
He wouldn't have made it...

01:14:25.929 --> 01:14:27.695
you wouldn't have made it
through the Ring of Fire

01:14:27.697 --> 01:14:29.630
- if it wasn't for me.
- That's not true.

01:14:29.632 --> 01:14:32.200
I passed three fire tests
before you even got there.

01:14:32.202 --> 01:14:35.069
- I saved you, man!
- Scott! Scott.

01:14:35.071 --> 01:14:37.705
He gave me
my first orgasm.

01:14:37.707 --> 01:14:41.108
- What's an orgasm?
- What the heck?

01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:42.477
What?

01:14:44.914 --> 01:14:47.982
And her second.

01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:49.984
I'm sorry I didn't tell you,
but I didn't think you were

01:14:49.986 --> 01:14:51.152
going to go and get him.

01:14:52.822 --> 01:14:55.089
So you used me.

01:14:55.091 --> 01:14:56.958
I didn't mean to,
but I guess I learned a couple

01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:00.561
of manipulative tactics here.

01:15:00.563 --> 01:15:01.662
From me.

01:15:03.566 --> 01:15:04.966
I'm so sorry, Scott.

01:15:04.968 --> 01:15:07.001
- It's not easy.
- No, it's not easy.

01:15:07.003 --> 01:15:08.769
You will always be
the man I almost married

01:15:08.771 --> 01:15:10.805
before I got a nail
in my head.

01:15:10.807 --> 01:15:13.808
Howard's the big-picture guy
and he's taking care of me now.

01:15:13.810 --> 01:15:16.210
He's the big-picture guy?

01:15:16.212 --> 01:15:18.279
<i>I'm gonna tell you something.
He's only two-thirds of a man.</i>

01:15:18.281 --> 01:15:20.114
He knows he is.
He's not going to
be there for you.

01:15:20.116 --> 01:15:21.716
You mark my words.

01:15:21.718 --> 01:15:23.184
I'm going to be right here
waiting for you

01:15:23.186 --> 01:15:25.520
because I'm strong like that.
Right, ladies?

01:15:25.522 --> 01:15:27.889
You can't break up with Scotty.
He's too cute!

01:15:27.891 --> 01:15:30.992
- No, Howard's cuter.
- Scott's cuter.

01:15:30.994 --> 01:15:32.293
Unlike some people
who need to be rescued

01:15:32.295 --> 01:15:34.061
like a little baby
from the Ring of Fire.

01:15:34.063 --> 01:15:37.632
- Scott!
- Howard!

01:15:45.174 --> 01:15:48.142
Come on, everyone!
Wake up!

01:16:45.969 --> 01:16:48.069
Do your thing, girl.

01:16:53.776 --> 01:16:55.710
Pretty cool, isn't it?

01:16:55.712 --> 01:16:57.244
Yeah.

01:16:57.246 --> 01:17:00.047
Howard. Oh, my God.
There she is.

01:17:00.049 --> 01:17:02.683
How are we going
to get anything done
with her as Speaker?

01:17:02.685 --> 01:17:05.686
Let's just see
how this goes.

01:17:05.688 --> 01:17:09.123
As Majority Whip
and acting Speaker

01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:11.225
of the House
of Representatives,

01:17:11.227 --> 01:17:16.297
I declare this 110th Congress
be called to order.

01:17:22.372 --> 01:17:25.873
As this new session begins,
I want to demonstrate

01:17:25.875 --> 01:17:28.309
what a fair Speaker
I intend to be

01:17:28.311 --> 01:17:30.978
so that members will keep that
in mind when they vote

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:32.847
for my confirmation next week.

01:17:32.849 --> 01:17:36.784
So in that spirit,
is there any new business?

01:17:36.786 --> 01:17:42.790
Madam Speaker, I move to propose
a basic Catastrophic Care bill

01:17:42.792 --> 01:17:44.025
for all Americans!

01:17:44.027 --> 01:17:45.693
Yeah!

01:17:53.002 --> 01:17:55.336
Order!
Order, please!

01:17:55.338 --> 01:17:57.338
- We have a motion
on the floor.

01:17:57.340 --> 01:17:59.807
<i>Madam Speaker, please wait!</i>

01:17:59.809 --> 01:18:01.842
I hold in my hand
some important revelations

01:18:01.844 --> 01:18:03.811
that I believe
will affect the new bill

01:18:03.813 --> 01:18:06.881
Mr. Birdwell introduced.

01:18:06.883 --> 01:18:08.716
- What have they got?
- I have no idea.

01:18:08.718 --> 01:18:10.818
- You have no idea?
- I have no idea.

01:18:14.757 --> 01:18:16.023
I'm... I'm...

01:18:16.025 --> 01:18:19.093
This appears to be
a signed affidavit

01:18:19.095 --> 01:18:22.930
showing that Mr. Birdwell
promised another woman lobbyist

01:18:22.932 --> 01:18:25.966
not just nine months ago
that he would introduce

01:18:25.968 --> 01:18:29.003
a bill for her
in exchange for sexual favors.

01:18:31.441 --> 01:18:34.308
This pattern
clearly continues today

01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:38.446
with Mr. Birdwell's introduction
of this frivolous measure.

01:18:38.448 --> 01:18:41.716
It is shocking
that anyone can purchase

01:18:41.718 --> 01:18:44.251
a congressman's influence
with sex.

01:18:44.253 --> 01:18:45.953
None of this is true!

01:18:45.955 --> 01:18:49.090
Apparently, we have
the woman right here.

01:18:54.897 --> 01:18:57.198
<i>I never had
a lobbyist like that.</i>

01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:00.468
Woo.
She's something.

01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:04.138
Madam Speaker, only members
are allowed to address Congress!

01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:07.374
<i>It's highly irregular,
but I'm going to allow it,</i>

01:19:07.376 --> 01:19:08.943
given the severity
of the charges

01:19:08.945 --> 01:19:11.045
and how many tax dollars
you've wasted.

01:19:12.381 --> 01:19:15.316
Miss, what legislation
did you use your hot body

01:19:15.318 --> 01:19:17.818
to get Mr. Birdwell
to introduce here?

01:19:21.357 --> 01:19:24.792
He helped one of my clients
to develop handgun factories

01:19:24.794 --> 01:19:27.928
in endangered
spotted owl preserves.

01:19:29.432 --> 01:19:31.465
I was told that the only way
that I could get funds

01:19:31.467 --> 01:19:34.368
for my colored glues
and for good school stuff

01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:38.172
was if I put it aside in some
private development deal,

01:19:38.174 --> 01:19:41.408
which I now realize
was a factory for handguns.

01:19:41.410 --> 01:19:44.411
It seems Mr. Birdwell's
convictions can be bought

01:19:44.413 --> 01:19:47.548
fairly easily if you've
got a nice pair of legs.

01:19:47.550 --> 01:19:50.084
Look, you tried
to do something good

01:19:50.086 --> 01:19:51.952
and you got twisted up
in the system.

01:19:51.954 --> 01:19:54.155
This is just one woman.
No big deal.

01:19:54.157 --> 01:19:55.823
This isn't
the only woman lobbyist

01:19:55.825 --> 01:19:57.491
Mr. Birdwell slept with.

01:20:03.432 --> 01:20:04.865
Howard.

01:20:10.973 --> 01:20:13.941
This second woman
got Mr. Birdwell

01:20:13.943 --> 01:20:16.477
to introduce a bill on...

01:20:16.479 --> 01:20:18.078
Dynamite fishing.

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:20.080
You monster!

01:20:20.082 --> 01:20:22.216
It was for polluted lakes
with toxic fish.

01:20:22.218 --> 01:20:24.118
And I had to get on the board
of that dynamite bill

01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:26.387
if I was going to get heard
at all on my colored glues.

01:20:26.389 --> 01:20:28.355
<i>Yeah, whatever!</i>

01:20:30.493 --> 01:20:31.859
Alice.

01:20:31.861 --> 01:20:33.460
Alice, you all right?

01:20:33.462 --> 01:20:35.996
- Wait!
<i>- I am no one's tool.</i>

01:20:35.998 --> 01:20:38.199
I was trying
to do something good.

01:20:38.201 --> 01:20:39.967
And I had to support
these other bills

01:20:39.969 --> 01:20:41.569
that I hoped
would go nowhere.

01:20:41.571 --> 01:20:43.237
<i>And you're doing it
again today.</i>

01:20:43.239 --> 01:20:46.106
Just so you can
get yourself a piece

01:20:46.108 --> 01:20:49.310
of 25-year-old
roller waitress ass.

01:20:51.214 --> 01:20:52.613
<i>This is different.</i>

01:20:52.615 --> 01:20:54.315
How are we supposed
to know that?

01:20:54.317 --> 01:20:55.983
You sell your influence
all over the place.

01:20:55.985 --> 01:20:57.952
You stand there now
with your arm

01:20:57.954 --> 01:20:59.587
around that
red-dressed hussy.

01:20:59.589 --> 01:21:01.422
This sounds like
a possible censure

01:21:01.424 --> 01:21:02.890
involving ethics charges.

01:21:02.892 --> 01:21:04.158
I'm afraid it does.

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:05.626
Too bad!
He deserves it!

01:21:05.628 --> 01:21:09.029
Scott, stop it!

01:21:09.031 --> 01:21:11.131
Madam Speaker, I'd like
to say something.

01:21:11.133 --> 01:21:13.033
<i>I am sorry.
That's out of order.</i>

01:21:13.035 --> 01:21:15.569
You can't address the House.
Rules are rules.

01:21:15.571 --> 01:21:17.271
You let those other
hot ladies speak!

01:21:17.273 --> 01:21:18.873
- Why can't Alice?
- Right.

01:21:18.875 --> 01:21:20.875
Otherwise, I can't
fix my broke ass!

01:21:22.511 --> 01:21:25.613
<i>And other peoples'
broken issues!</i>

01:21:25.615 --> 01:21:28.983
Even the most partisan battles
demand fairness!

01:21:28.985 --> 01:21:32.119
And you yourself said
your conduct here today

01:21:32.121 --> 01:21:35.122
will be remembered tomorrow
when we vote to confirm!

01:21:35.124 --> 01:21:36.423
Here, here!

01:21:36.425 --> 01:21:38.893
Here, here!

01:21:38.895 --> 01:21:40.494
One minute.

01:21:42.598 --> 01:21:46.400
You have the floor
for one minute.

01:21:46.402 --> 01:21:48.035
I'm going to go.
I'm going to go.

01:21:48.037 --> 01:21:50.004
Okay, okay.
Are you okay?

01:21:50.006 --> 01:21:51.566
What?

01:22:00.483 --> 01:22:02.049
Sorry.

01:22:05.388 --> 01:22:08.555
This bill...

01:22:08.557 --> 01:22:13.360
is about more than
a single congressman

01:22:13.362 --> 01:22:15.663
or his lobbyist woes.

01:22:15.665 --> 01:22:18.232
Because you know what?

01:22:18.234 --> 01:22:20.534
Not everyone has
really awesome healthcare

01:22:20.536 --> 01:22:22.970
like you guys do here
in Washington.

01:22:22.972 --> 01:22:25.439
And all it takes
is a gondola

01:22:25.441 --> 01:22:28.943
or an automatic power tool.

01:22:28.945 --> 01:22:31.211
And if you're uninsured

01:22:31.213 --> 01:22:36.216
or if you're
even crappily insured,

01:22:36.218 --> 01:22:39.453
you're screwed like me.

01:22:41.657 --> 01:22:43.557
Or like him.

01:22:43.559 --> 01:22:46.994
Or like him.
And is that cool?

01:22:46.996 --> 01:22:50.431
It is not cool.

01:22:50.433 --> 01:22:54.001
This is America, right?

01:22:54.003 --> 01:22:56.603
And we do things right here
and we help people.

01:22:56.605 --> 01:22:58.672
<i>And we take care
of people here.</i>

01:22:58.674 --> 01:23:03.277
Ow! Man, it hurts.
My face feels like

01:23:03.279 --> 01:23:04.445
- it's going to fall off.
- Alice?

01:23:04.447 --> 01:23:08.182
I believe in America!

01:23:12.722 --> 01:23:14.455
Alice!

01:23:19.562 --> 01:23:21.261
Yeah!

01:23:32.708 --> 01:23:36.477
- Hey, are you okay?
- I'm a little dizzy.

01:23:36.479 --> 01:23:39.747
- Okay. You were amazing.
- I was?

01:23:39.749 --> 01:23:42.182
Well done!
That was just wonderful.

01:23:42.184 --> 01:23:44.284
Madam Speaker,
you must call for a vote.

01:23:44.286 --> 01:23:46.587
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:23:46.589 --> 01:23:50.391
Vote, vote, vote!

01:23:50.393 --> 01:23:52.026
Very well, we'll vote.

01:23:52.028 --> 01:23:55.295
But remember, federally funded
care is a slippery slope

01:23:55.297 --> 01:23:58.165
leading to higher taxes
and lousy service.

01:23:58.167 --> 01:24:00.034
Well, we just heard them.

01:24:00.036 --> 01:24:02.236
I think they're going
to do the right thing.

01:24:04.774 --> 01:24:08.675
This is going
to be so dramatic here
when everyone votes.

01:24:08.677 --> 01:24:10.411
Absolutely.

01:24:10.413 --> 01:24:12.093
<i>Begin the vote.</i>

01:24:13.549 --> 01:24:16.183
- It's all electronic now.
- What?

01:24:23.526 --> 01:24:25.326
<i>The vote is completed.</i>

01:24:25.327 --> 01:24:27.828
Healthcare loses like always.

01:24:31.233 --> 01:24:34.735
- I don't feel so good.
- Alice? Alice!

01:24:34.737 --> 01:24:38.272
Alice! Alice!

01:24:38.274 --> 01:24:39.740
Alice!

01:24:41.410 --> 01:24:42.776
Get a picture.

01:24:45.114 --> 01:24:47.648
<i>- Alice, are you okay?</i>
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

01:24:47.650 --> 01:24:50.684
Oh.

01:24:50.686 --> 01:24:53.787
I care about
everyone under this roof
no matter our differences.

01:24:53.789 --> 01:24:55.589
<i>- Madam Speaker...
- Look up, please.</i>

01:24:55.591 --> 01:24:58.559
<i>One more.</i>

01:24:58.561 --> 01:25:01.128
<i>Madam Speaker,
one more, please.</i>

01:25:01.130 --> 01:25:03.430
Wait, wait,
where are you going?

01:25:03.432 --> 01:25:05.499
Alice, we're going to get you
a glass of water, okay?

01:25:05.501 --> 01:25:07.334
- Okay.
<i>- Alice!</i>

01:25:07.336 --> 01:25:09.436
- What do you need?
- I'm okay. I'm just dizzy.

01:25:09.438 --> 01:25:12.172
I just need some air.
I need some air.

01:25:12.174 --> 01:25:14.741
I got you.

01:25:14.743 --> 01:25:16.543
Nice and easy, guys.

01:25:21.150 --> 01:25:23.650
Are you okay?

01:25:23.652 --> 01:25:27.154
I'm a little lightheaded,
but it's getting better.

01:25:27.156 --> 01:25:30.157
Alice, I can't believe
this happened.

01:25:30.159 --> 01:25:32.392
Marsha.

01:25:32.394 --> 01:25:34.895
<i>- I'm sorry, Alice.
- It just wasn't meant to be.</i>

01:25:34.897 --> 01:25:38.265
I'm just right back
where I started.

01:25:38.267 --> 01:25:41.568
Who knows when
we'll get fixed now.

01:25:41.570 --> 01:25:43.537
You are not just a leader,
you're one of them.

01:25:43.539 --> 01:25:45.339
You been lying
this whole time.

01:25:45.341 --> 01:25:47.241
That's why you won't let me
near your backside,

01:25:47.243 --> 01:25:51.712
because you got
a pop-out baboon ass.

01:25:55.151 --> 01:25:57.651
- Tell her.
- Yes, it's true.

01:25:57.653 --> 01:26:02.523
But Norm and Alice said
that you'd love me anyway.

01:26:02.525 --> 01:26:05.826
All the lies are over.
True love can begin.

01:26:05.828 --> 01:26:09.229
Actually...

01:26:09.231 --> 01:26:10.764
that's a deal breaker.

01:26:10.766 --> 01:26:14.301
I'm sorry, Keyshawn.
I can't be with you.

01:26:19.408 --> 01:26:22.776
Between your breakup,
the loss of our bill,

01:26:22.778 --> 01:26:25.679
I'm feeling
pretty sure we're alone
in a Godless universe.

01:26:25.681 --> 01:26:28.815
I've been waiting
for a sign there's a God
and there is no sign.

01:26:28.817 --> 01:26:31.685
<i>- Let's just get
- Alice home, okay?</i>

01:26:31.687 --> 01:26:34.188
Hey, now that you're famous,
it should be easy

01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:36.223
to get you
some medical help.

01:26:36.225 --> 01:26:39.526
But what about
Norm and Keyshawn?

01:26:39.528 --> 01:26:42.763
And all those people?
I wanted to help them.

01:26:42.765 --> 01:26:44.698
And where's Howard?

01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:47.434
I don't think you need
to think about that right now.

01:26:47.436 --> 01:26:48.836
<i>- What do you mean?
- Where is he?</i>

01:26:48.837 --> 01:26:50.804
No surprise there.

01:26:53.242 --> 01:26:55.642
What?

01:26:55.644 --> 01:26:57.411
<i>- They're lizard people,
- Alice.</i>

01:26:57.413 --> 01:26:59.580
<i>They change their skins
and eat their young.</i>

01:26:59.582 --> 01:27:02.716
It's time to go home
and make a real life there.

01:27:02.718 --> 01:27:05.519
- I don't know.
- It'd be fun to have a slave.

01:27:05.521 --> 01:27:08.388
- If he's really sorry.
- He is, he is.

01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:10.390
Wait and see.

01:27:10.392 --> 01:27:11.992
It'll be an asset.

01:27:11.994 --> 01:27:14.828
- Okay, let's see it.
- Thank you. You won't be sorry.

01:27:14.830 --> 01:27:17.364
Order!

01:27:17.366 --> 01:27:21.001
We have an important statement
by Congressman Birdwell.

01:27:21.003 --> 01:27:23.637
<i>Thank you, Madam Speaker.</i>

01:27:23.639 --> 01:27:26.607
First of all, I would
like to clearly state

01:27:26.609 --> 01:27:30.944
what a foolhardy mistake it was
for me to leave my party.

01:27:30.946 --> 01:27:35.549
<i>The same goes for sponsoring
that Catastrophic Care bill.</i>

01:27:35.551 --> 01:27:38.285
<i>Thank God it didn't pass.</i>

01:27:38.287 --> 01:27:40.687
I was under
the spell of a woman
which, as demonstrated

01:27:40.689 --> 01:27:44.258
by Madam Speaker today,
is my weakness.

01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:46.994
I stand here today
humbly begging my colleagues

01:27:46.996 --> 01:27:48.929
to forgive
my temporary insanity

01:27:48.931 --> 01:27:52.966
and let me back
into their strong party.

01:27:55.704 --> 01:27:58.505
Which is so much better
than those Independents.

01:27:58.507 --> 01:28:01.408
They're so lame.
I mean, how many
of them are there?

01:28:01.410 --> 01:28:03.543
Like three?

01:28:03.545 --> 01:28:04.945
<i>That's not a party.</i>

01:28:04.947 --> 01:28:07.314
Let's get
this moon base going!

01:28:07.316 --> 01:28:09.850
Here, here!

01:28:11.687 --> 01:28:14.288
How could you, Howard?

01:28:24.033 --> 01:28:27.434
Furthermore, I would like
to show my loyalty

01:28:27.436 --> 01:28:31.505
and honor the late Speaker McCoy
by proposing that we rename

01:28:31.507 --> 01:28:36.410
the Congressional Gym
the "McCoy Memorial Gymnasium."

01:28:42.851 --> 01:28:45.552
Yeah! Yes!

01:28:45.554 --> 01:28:46.887
Welcome back, Howard.

01:28:46.889 --> 01:28:48.021
Welcome back.

01:28:55.431 --> 01:28:57.831
I just want
to get out of this town
as fast as possible.

01:28:57.833 --> 01:29:00.567
If it's any consolation,
all the women who've slept
with Howard

01:29:00.569 --> 01:29:01.968
said the sex was either
average or below average.

01:29:01.970 --> 01:29:03.837
How's it going, hon?
You ready to go?

01:29:03.839 --> 01:29:06.406
- Yeah, I'm almost packed.
- All right, let me help you.

01:29:06.408 --> 01:29:08.108
Look at it this way,
you learned a lot

01:29:08.110 --> 01:29:10.477
about horrible liars.

01:29:10.479 --> 01:29:12.679
...gymnasium bill today
turned into mayhem

01:29:12.681 --> 01:29:15.048
due to a surprise rider
that was snuck into the bill.

01:29:15.050 --> 01:29:17.117
- Oh, my gosh!
-<i> A version of</i>
<i>the emergency care bill...</i>

01:29:17.119 --> 01:29:18.719
- You still got it!
- <i> ...was snuck into</i>

01:29:18.721 --> 01:29:20.120
the Congressional Gymnasium
Renovation bill

01:29:20.122 --> 01:29:22.789
by notorious Congressman
Howard Birdwell.

01:29:22.791 --> 01:29:24.391
- What?
- Howard?

01:29:24.393 --> 01:29:26.360
Now that is a sign
I'm looking for.

01:29:26.362 --> 01:29:30.030
Here to comment
is pending House Speaker
Pam Henry Hendrickson.

01:29:30.032 --> 01:29:31.765
How could you
and other voting members

01:29:31.767 --> 01:29:33.967
not even read the bill,
Congresswoman?

01:29:33.969 --> 01:29:36.837
Of course I skim, Tom.
I can't read everything.
It's a lot of paperwork.

01:29:36.839 --> 01:29:39.740
My chief of staff, Edwin,
usually carefully

01:29:39.742 --> 01:29:42.476
reviews bills for me,
but this time he let me
take it in the neck.

01:29:42.478 --> 01:29:46.380
So I understand the sneaky
little rider only provides

01:29:46.382 --> 01:29:48.849
for emergency healthcare
for the following accidents,

01:29:48.851 --> 01:29:51.451
a nail in the head,
a fallen anus...

01:29:51.453 --> 01:29:55.389
- Yeah!
-... prolonged priapism,
an ax in the femur,

01:29:55.391 --> 01:29:57.724
a face burn
from a s'mores
while camping.

01:29:57.726 --> 01:29:59.760
Everyone else,
you're on your own
as usual.

01:29:59.762 --> 01:30:01.561
Is this
a meaningless victory?

01:30:01.563 --> 01:30:03.663
This small but extremely
dangerous bill

01:30:03.665 --> 01:30:06.066
has opened a door
to a potential avalanche

01:30:06.068 --> 01:30:08.001
of socialist
medical spending.

01:30:08.003 --> 01:30:09.970
Let's not forget
child lesbianism.

01:30:09.972 --> 01:30:11.571
Ooh, you witch.

01:30:11.573 --> 01:30:13.106
And we did pass
the moon base bill.

01:30:13.108 --> 01:30:14.674
That's what counts.

01:30:14.676 --> 01:30:16.510
Thank you, Madam Speaker.

01:30:16.512 --> 01:30:17.978
Now Birdwell's sneakiness
has earned him

01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:19.813
the dreaded triple censure.

01:30:19.815 --> 01:30:22.749
He's now expected to officially
resign from Congress

01:30:22.751 --> 01:30:23.984
before he's kicked out.

01:30:23.986 --> 01:30:25.619
- Wow.
- Oh, that's too bad.

01:30:25.621 --> 01:30:27.587
Mr. Birdwell joins us live
via satellite.

01:30:27.589 --> 01:30:30.123
Sounds like
you're in very hot water
with your leadership.

01:30:30.125 --> 01:30:31.992
They got their moon base, Tom,
but they'd pretty much

01:30:31.994 --> 01:30:33.627
like to kill me
and throw my body

01:30:33.629 --> 01:30:35.061
into a wheat thresher,
which they pretty much

01:30:35.063 --> 01:30:36.763
already done
with this triple censure.

01:30:36.765 --> 01:30:38.632
Was the sneaky risk
worth it?

01:30:38.634 --> 01:30:40.500
Yes! To help
all the people.

01:30:40.502 --> 01:30:43.904
Alice's friends, really,
but especially Alice.

01:30:43.906 --> 01:30:45.539
All right, we don't
need to watch that.

01:30:45.541 --> 01:30:46.773
- I'm going
to change it.
- Scott.

01:30:46.775 --> 01:30:48.942
No, no, no.
Move, move, move.

01:30:48.944 --> 01:30:50.977
- This is so boring.
- Come on.

01:30:50.979 --> 01:30:53.747
...really frustrating
would know that I had to seem

01:30:53.749 --> 01:30:56.049
like I was betraying her
to get this done.

01:30:56.051 --> 01:30:58.819
I thought he was a traitor,
but he's not.

01:30:58.821 --> 01:31:00.654
He's not anymore.
He's not a traitor.

01:31:00.656 --> 01:31:04.024
All for her and her dream,
which I totally share.

01:31:04.026 --> 01:31:05.859
She inspires me
in all departments

01:31:05.861 --> 01:31:08.795
from making laws to making love,
which is private,

01:31:08.797 --> 01:31:10.931
and now it's on TV,
so it's not private.

01:31:10.933 --> 01:31:13.467
<i>I just had to say this
because I know if she heard me</i>

01:31:13.469 --> 01:31:15.168
that she would stop
hating me.

01:31:15.170 --> 01:31:20.740
So, Alice, I don't even know
if you're watching this.

01:31:20.742 --> 01:31:22.542
I am. I am.

01:31:22.544 --> 01:31:26.246
But everything I did,
I did for you.

01:31:26.248 --> 01:31:27.581
I love you.

01:31:27.583 --> 01:31:31.117
I love you, too.
I love you, too.

01:31:33.155 --> 01:31:36.189
All right, well,
I realized that there was
about a 48% chance

01:31:36.191 --> 01:31:39.960
of this happening,
which is why I kept
the Brenda option 70% open.

01:31:39.962 --> 01:31:43.096
Is that why
you're speaking to us
from a motel parking lot?

01:31:43.098 --> 01:31:45.031
Yeah.
This is Alice's motel.

01:31:45.033 --> 01:31:46.933
What?

01:31:50.138 --> 01:31:51.238
Howard!

01:31:55.744 --> 01:31:57.611
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:32:06.922 --> 01:32:09.556
<i>Before we get
to the ring part,</i>

01:32:09.558 --> 01:32:12.859
<i>I want to say that</i>
<i>what we were looking for</i>
<i>was inside of us all along,</i>

01:32:12.861 --> 01:32:14.528
but that's just not true.

01:32:14.530 --> 01:32:19.299
No, our journey
was so much messier than that

01:32:19.301 --> 01:32:22.235
as life, it often is.

01:32:22.237 --> 01:32:26.306
I'm going to have our
congressional candidate groom

01:32:26.308 --> 01:32:29.943
tell you what was
really required.

01:32:29.945 --> 01:32:35.015
It took a cloakroom hookup,
a mob of Girl Squaws,

01:32:35.017 --> 01:32:40.220
a strange men's retreat located
by a lovesick state trooper,

01:32:40.222 --> 01:32:43.256
insane quasi
legal maneuvering...

01:32:43.258 --> 01:32:45.125
Well...

01:32:45.127 --> 01:32:47.160
- ...and extreme,
unpredictable God...
- Yep.

01:32:47.162 --> 01:32:49.195
...to get us
where we stand today.

01:32:49.197 --> 01:32:51.264
Yep.

01:32:51.266 --> 01:32:54.768
These are the things
we've seen

01:32:54.770 --> 01:32:56.603
that make
our democracy work.

01:32:56.605 --> 01:33:01.741
Yes.
My pants fit once again.

01:33:01.743 --> 01:33:05.712
It is a joyous day indeed.

01:33:05.714 --> 01:33:09.282
Would the bride and groom
please kiss each other good?

01:33:11.687 --> 01:33:14.020
Yeah! Kanye!

01:33:29.171 --> 01:33:32.639
<i>¶ Hush, now, child ¶</i>

01:33:32.641 --> 01:33:35.875
<i>¶ And don't cry ¶</i>

01:33:35.877 --> 01:33:39.679
<i>¶ Your folks
might understand you ¶</i>

01:33:39.681 --> 01:33:41.114
<i>¶ By and by... ¶</i>

01:33:41.116 --> 01:33:42.782
<i>Get it, girl.</i>

01:33:42.784 --> 01:33:45.819
- <i> ¶ Just move on up... ¶</i>
- Okay...

01:33:45.821 --> 01:33:49.222
<i>¶ Toward your destination ¶</i>

01:33:49.224 --> 01:33:51.091
<i>¶ Though you may find ¶</i>

01:33:51.093 --> 01:33:54.794
<i>¶ From time to time
complication... ¶</i>

01:34:02.237 --> 01:34:04.638
All right!

01:34:10.145 --> 01:34:13.246
<i>¶ Bite your lip ¶</i>

01:34:13.248 --> 01:34:16.716
<i>¶ And take the trip ¶</i>

01:34:16.718 --> 01:34:20.120
<i>¶ Though there may be
a wet road ahead ¶</i>

01:34:20.122 --> 01:34:22.389
<i>¶ And you cannot slip ¶</i>

01:34:23.692 --> 01:34:27.093
<i>¶ Just move on up ¶</i>

01:34:27.095 --> 01:34:30.764
<i>¶ For peace you'll find ¶</i>

01:34:30.766 --> 01:34:34.100
<i>¶ Into the steeple
of beautiful people ¶</i>

01:34:34.102 --> 01:34:36.970
<i>¶ Where there's only
one kind... ¶</i>

01:34:36.972 --> 01:34:38.772
Hey, excuse me, everyone.

01:34:38.774 --> 01:34:42.008
I have a really special toast
and an important question

01:34:42.010 --> 01:34:45.078
to ask Howard.

01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:47.881
Since the first day
that I met you, I knew that
you were something spec...

01:34:47.883 --> 01:34:50.784
Ow! My eye!

01:34:50.786 --> 01:34:53.453
Head's up!

01:34:53.455 --> 01:34:56.089
- Ah!
- Oh, my eye!

01:34:58.694 --> 01:35:00.927
<i>¶ Move on up ¶</i>

01:35:00.929 --> 01:35:04.164
Well, I am inviting you
to a military moodiam

01:35:04.166 --> 01:35:06.066
moodiam mean base
spent before.

01:35:06.068 --> 01:35:08.868
<i>¶ Remember your dream
is your only scheme ¶</i>

01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:11.337
- <i> ¶ So keep on pushing... ¶</i>
- No, don't.

01:35:11.339 --> 01:35:14.774
She is going to rack us
all over the coals

01:35:14.776 --> 01:35:17.176
and it's not going
to be a good time.

01:35:19.147 --> 01:35:21.014
Excellent.

01:35:21.016 --> 01:35:23.416
Howard!
All right, all right.

01:35:23.418 --> 01:35:26.119
Mr. Speaker?

01:35:26.121 --> 01:35:29.355
<i>¶ Take nothing less ¶</i>

01:35:29.357 --> 01:35:33.126
<i>¶ Than the supreme best ¶</i>

01:35:33.128 --> 01:35:36.196
<i>¶ Do not obey
for most people say ¶</i>

01:35:36.198 --> 01:35:38.932
<i>¶ For you can pass
the test ¶</i>

01:35:40.168 --> 01:35:43.369
<i>¶ Just move on up ¶</i>

01:35:43.371 --> 01:35:47.073
<i>¶ To a greater day ¶</i>

01:35:47.075 --> 01:35:50.243
<i>¶ Just a little faith,
if you put your mind to it ¶</i>

01:35:50.245 --> 01:35:52.445
<i>¶ You can surely do it... ¶</i>

01:35:55.050 --> 01:35:57.450
All right, come on!

01:36:08.230 --> 01:36:10.463
<i>¶ Just move on up ¶</i>

01:36:11.933 --> 01:36:13.533

01:36:15.070 --> 01:36:17.337

we'll just move on up ¶</i>
