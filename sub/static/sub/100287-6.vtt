Where are you?

01:29.732 --> 01:31.333
Walking.

01:36.214 --> 01:38.254
Can you come home, please, baby?

01:40.935 --> 01:42.455
I want to explain.

01:46.416 --> 01:48.136
Lloyd?

01:53.377 --> 01:54.717
Please?

01:54.817 --> 01:56.618
I know I should have told you.

02:02.659 --> 02:04.139

02:44.907 --> 02:47.227
I don't understand what's going on.

02:48.347 --> 02:49.868
It's complicated, Ive.

02:52.428 --> 02:54.849
Can you please just tell me
it's gonna get sorted out?

02:54.949 --> 02:56.429
-I want to.

02:57.429 --> 02:58.769
We'll get there.

02:58.869 --> 03:00.310
[door unlocking]

03:05.871 --> 03:07.771
-[Lloyd] What are you doing up so late,
poppet?

03:07.871 --> 03:09.371
I'm worried about you.

03:09.471 --> 03:11.692
-I know. I'm past my curfew.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.752
You're gonna have to ground me.

03:15.592 --> 03:18.573
But if you turn up late and grumpy
to your mum's tomorrow,

03:18.673 --> 03:22.174
she's gonna send someone over
to pull my toenails out, OK?

03:22.274 --> 03:26.795
So, on the count of five, I want
you in bed or no story, OK. [chuckles]

03:28.835 --> 03:32.336
Remember the last time
I read a story to you?

03:32.436 --> 03:36.937
It was in a heatwave like this
and we slept in the bathroom on the floor

03:37.037 --> 03:38.537
because it was the coolest place
in the house.

03:38.637 --> 03:39.777
Do you remember that?

03:39.877 --> 03:42.138
-'The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe'.
-[Lloyd laughs]

03:42.238 --> 03:44.398

the worst dreams...

03:58.921 --> 04:00.921
[sombre music]

04:35.368 --> 04:37.848
-[Eadie] You were meant to find it
after the party.

04:41.089 --> 04:42.609
How many weeks?

04:45.289 --> 04:46.450
Ten.

04:47.450 --> 04:48.610
Ten weeks?

04:49.770 --> 04:51.731
So ten weeks ago, you...

04:53.891 --> 04:56.252
you picked up the embryo,
you took it to the clinic?

04:59.612 --> 05:02.733
That must have been around the time of
the uh... the presentation.

05:04.933 --> 05:06.113
Just before.

05:06.213 --> 05:07.574
Just before.

05:10.414 --> 05:12.215
Then they implanted it?

05:13.215 --> 05:14.315
-Mm-hm.

05:14.415 --> 05:17.856
And they also prescribed
the immunosuppressant drugs?

05:20.016 --> 05:21.596
You're OK talking about this, right?

05:21.696 --> 05:24.717
Because at the moment
I've just got this...

05:24.817 --> 05:27.117
this massive ten week black hole

05:27.217 --> 05:29.978
and I'm just trying to get
a little bit of ground under my feet.

05:34.819 --> 05:36.019
Where are they?

05:37.739 --> 05:39.200
What?

05:39.300 --> 05:41.580
The drugs -
where have you been keeping them?

05:43.260 --> 05:44.581
Downstairs.

05:45.821 --> 05:47.001
Where?

05:47.101 --> 05:49.062
In the kitchen.

05:54.823 --> 05:57.563
What are you doing? Lloyd...

05:57.663 --> 05:59.063
Lloyd.

06:09.185 --> 06:11.006
-Kitchen cupboard?
-Lloyd...

06:11.106 --> 06:13.486
-Warmer, colder?
-Lloyd, please.

06:13.586 --> 06:15.046
I'm gonna need a clue here, babe.

06:15.146 --> 06:16.607
What are you trying to do?

06:16.707 --> 06:20.247
I just wanna see what you've been taking
and know where you've been keeping it.

06:20.347 --> 06:21.508
That's all.

06:25.028 --> 06:26.629
Fine. Fine.

06:36.470 --> 06:37.951
You've really gone to some lengths.

06:41.191 --> 06:42.712
Can I see?

06:50.953 --> 06:53.554
Have you taken them today?
Have you done the jab?

06:55.714 --> 06:57.695
Off you go, then.

06:57.795 --> 06:59.215
No? You're not comfortable?

06:59.315 --> 07:01.295
-You want me to help?
-Stop it, Lloyd...

07:01.395 --> 07:02.855
-You don't want me to help?
-Just stop it.

07:02.955 --> 07:04.856
Or am I only part of this
when you decide I am?

07:04.956 --> 07:06.296
Stop!

07:06.396 --> 07:08.437
'Cause I'm trying to get in the tent here,
Eadie. I'm trying to get in.

07:09.877 --> 07:12.377
-'Cause I want to.
-I know. I know. And I'm sorry.

07:12.477 --> 07:16.758
And if I could go back and do it all again
differently, I would, but I can't.

07:21.879 --> 07:23.319
Side effects?

07:25.440 --> 07:27.100
Not as bad as I expected.

07:27.200 --> 07:30.221
One more week
and I'm through the danger zone.

07:30.321 --> 07:31.481
Really?

07:32.721 --> 07:36.062
Because my memory was that
the big complications, the...

07:36.162 --> 07:39.622
the cancer, the...
the bone marrow problems,

07:39.722 --> 07:42.303
they might only show up
well down the track.

07:42.403 --> 07:44.183
I don't expect it to make sense to you,

07:44.283 --> 07:47.764
but the risk is worth it to me.

07:50.284 --> 07:51.965
You've just shoved me back out.

07:53.445 --> 07:54.925
It's not my call.

07:55.926 --> 07:57.666
My opinion doesn't count.

07:57.766 --> 08:00.146
You get to decide
that we'll bring a kid into the picture

08:00.246 --> 08:02.147
even if you are not around to raise it.

08:02.247 --> 08:05.447
That makes me a sperm donor, not a dad!

08:06.408 --> 08:08.188
How did you expect this to go?

08:08.288 --> 08:09.748
What did you think -
I was gonna come home,

08:09.848 --> 08:13.109
I was gonna see a picture of kids
that I didn't even know existed,

08:13.209 --> 08:14.689
on my pillow?

08:15.689 --> 08:18.870
And... surprise! That's all good.
It's all good.

08:18.970 --> 08:20.670
Well, yeah, yeah, maybe.

08:20.770 --> 08:24.631
Maybe I thought you might...
see the picture of the babies,

08:24.731 --> 08:29.472
of our babies, and you might be
so moved and so thrilled that...

08:29.572 --> 08:32.092
that none of how it happened
would really matter.

08:37.133 --> 08:41.414
[tense music]

08:44.935 --> 08:46.815
I don't want to lose you.

08:47.935 --> 08:49.576
And yet you let go.

08:58.057 --> 08:59.538
Twins, huh?

09:02.058 --> 09:03.898
Yeah.

09:07.699 --> 09:11.600
You know what I can't
get my head around is

09:11.700 --> 09:15.421
how you managed to doctor the baby app.

09:16.901 --> 09:20.101
It was a desperate thing to do,
but I was desperate, Lloyd.

-[Israel] I don't know, Rima.
How can we look them in the eye?

10:07.670 --> 10:09.291
Make them have this vaccination

10:09.391 --> 10:11.611
which means they may never have
what we have?

10:11.711 --> 10:13.632
-[Rima] 'Cause there's no alternative,
Israel.

10:14.792 --> 10:16.872
If we don't get residency,
they're going to send us back.

10:18.112 --> 10:20.593
Where to? Nothing left of our home.

10:22.153 --> 10:25.234
We rebuild again,
get wiped out next storm surge again.

10:26.874 --> 10:28.354
There is no choice here.

10:29.395 --> 10:31.395
Got to stay strong, Israel.

10:34.195 --> 10:36.736

With more hot weather on the way,

10:58.720 --> 11:00.140
[dishes clatter]

11:00.240 --> 11:02.081
-[Francesca] Don't worry about it darling,
we'll clean it up later.

11:02.681 --> 11:04.261
Being late's a trigger for me.

11:04.361 --> 11:06.542
-[girl] Tils! Tie up...
-You've forgotten, haven't you?

11:06.642 --> 11:07.822
-[girl] Give us your ribbon...
-What?

11:07.922 --> 11:09.422
-Cosmo, dentist. You said you'd drive him.

11:09.522 --> 11:11.182
Being late's a trigger for me.

11:11.282 --> 11:13.103
No, no, no, no, I haven't forgotten.
I never forget.

11:13.203 --> 11:15.423
I can't, that's all.
I've got a big meeting with the...

11:15.523 --> 11:18.144
A big strategy meeting with
the Department of Domestic Affairs.

11:18.244 --> 11:21.504
Strategise how you do that
and get Cosmo to the dentist appointment,

11:21.604 --> 11:22.785
which was booked three months ago.

11:22.885 --> 11:25.425
-Chesca, I can't.
-It's called being a dad. Let's go, girls.

11:25.525 --> 11:27.746
What have I been being for these
last God knows how many years?

11:27.846 --> 11:30.146
-Do you really want me to answer that?
Let's go.

11:30.246 --> 11:32.066
Oh, don't forget -
early dinner at Eadie's tonight.

11:32.166 --> 11:33.827
Can't we do it here?

11:33.927 --> 11:35.667
We can't keep doing that
every time they throw a dinner.

11:35.767 --> 11:36.947
It's just plain rude.

11:37.047 --> 11:38.628
Oh, fu... dge.

Just for a second so I can start the car.

13:32.829 --> 13:34.810
What? I tripped.
Don't worry about it. I'm fine.

we'll give the dentist a miss today.

14:19.958 --> 14:21.098
Your teeth are pretty clean.

14:21.198 --> 14:24.739

at lunch. Keep Mum off my back.

-How can I help, sir?
-Hi, Israel.

14:28.720 --> 14:31.140
I need a car into the city.
Can you organise it for me?

14:31.240 --> 14:33.501
Of course.
I'll let you know when it arrives.

14:33.601 --> 14:34.881
Thanks.

Now, about um...

14:40.042 --> 14:42.863
my little... accident.

14:42.963 --> 14:44.503
It's just between you and me, OK?

14:44.603 --> 14:46.263
Is something wrong with you?

14:46.363 --> 14:49.784
Well, it depends who you ask.
I mean, I'd say I was borderline perfect.

14:49.884 --> 14:51.444
No, it's all good. It's all good.

14:52.444 --> 14:53.925
It's all good, mate. I just...

14:55.805 --> 14:58.125
There's no need to worry Mum with it, OK?

14:59.286 --> 15:03.546
I won't tell Mum as long as you promise me
you'll see a doctor.

15:03.646 --> 15:05.367
OK.

15:07.327 --> 15:08.807

16:11.819 --> 16:13.300
Cooked the lot of them.

16:21.621 --> 16:23.062
Lloyd...

16:25.622 --> 16:27.822
This is what you wanted.

16:28.823 --> 16:32.123
You're focusing too much on
the backyard clinic thing,

16:32.223 --> 16:34.164
when really, in the scheme of things,

16:34.264 --> 16:37.564
she'll get off the drugs and you will have
two kids to take to soccer training.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.365
She got pregnant behind my back

16:39.465 --> 16:42.465
and clearly she went to great lengths
to keep it behind my back.

16:43.945 --> 16:46.486
And she's not telling me the whole truth.
I can feel it.

16:46.586 --> 16:48.646
So I'm sorry if it takes me
a couple of minutes

16:48.746 --> 16:50.787
just to get my head around
soccer training.

16:52.387 --> 16:54.587
I mean, why would she do that, huh?

16:55.908 --> 16:57.368
Unless they're not even mine.

16:57.468 --> 16:58.968
Oh, that's crazy.

16:59.068 --> 17:02.329
Is it crazy, is it? Because where I'm
standing, what she has done, that's crazy.

17:02.429 --> 17:04.129
So I don't know what to think anymore...

17:04.229 --> 17:06.450
I'm sorry, man,
but I don't understand you.

17:06.550 --> 17:08.290
You wanted kids, you wanted them badly.

17:08.390 --> 17:10.330
Now you've got them,
why does it matter how it happened?

17:10.430 --> 17:12.171
Why can't you just be happy about it?
Why do you have to...

17:12.271 --> 17:15.611
I'm sorry, are you trying to say
this is my fault? Is this my fault?

17:15.711 --> 17:17.712
-Is it my fault, Shay?
-Lloyd...

17:21.152 --> 17:22.873
You're unbelievable.

17:27.874 --> 17:29.794
What do we do about the vax?

17:33.515 --> 17:35.215
I wish I knew.

17:35.315 --> 17:40.736
[tense music]

17:40.836 --> 17:43.237
[crowd chattering]

17:53.839 --> 17:55.459
Malo el lelei.

17:55.559 --> 17:57.219
What's going on?

17:57.319 --> 17:59.500
It's the last day of the trial.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.260
We've decided to volunteer.

18:01.360 --> 18:05.381
I know you have concerns but I talked to
some other families last night.

18:05.481 --> 18:07.821
They all have more points than us.

18:07.921 --> 18:11.102
We have no insurance -
another point gone.

18:11.202 --> 18:12.902
Talia has asthma - another gone.

18:13.002 --> 18:16.183
We need these three from the vaccine
to get us over the line.

18:16.283 --> 18:18.243
[baby crying]

18:19.123 --> 18:21.084
There are only 250 doses left.

18:22.444 --> 18:23.904
And all these people.

18:24.004 --> 18:27.225
Chin up, Mum. Gotta be in it to win it.

18:27.325 --> 18:28.425
What do you mean?

18:28.525 --> 18:30.946
They're gonna put all our names down,

18:31.046 --> 18:33.726
mix them up and then pick out the winners.

18:34.686 --> 18:36.687
-Is Abel in there?
-Yeah.

18:37.727 --> 18:39.407
I'll see you later.

18:42.128 --> 18:44.748
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.
Just that I need to get through.

18:44.848 --> 18:46.589
-[Abel] Keep clear so that deliveries can
come through.

18:46.689 --> 18:49.269
-Glad you could join us.
-You turned this into a lottery?

18:49.369 --> 18:50.990
It's crowd control -
I had to do something.

18:51.090 --> 18:52.390
Look, you have to shut it down!

18:52.490 --> 18:54.230
The vaccine definitely contains
Lloyd's development,

18:54.330 --> 18:56.411
which means it carries
the same sterility risks.

18:56.891 --> 18:58.431
You know it's theirs for sure?

18:58.531 --> 19:00.331
-Yes.
-How?

19:01.211 --> 19:04.912
Look, if you want me to push back more,
I need something to do it with.

19:05.012 --> 19:06.492
They were able to test...

19:07.653 --> 19:10.513
the vaccine and it's an absolute match.

19:10.613 --> 19:12.414
And where did they get this sample from?

19:13.734 --> 19:16.254
I borrowed a sharps container.

19:17.695 --> 19:19.315
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

19:19.415 --> 19:20.555
Hey!

19:20.655 --> 19:22.075
Everyone take a breath!

19:22.175 --> 19:24.136
[echoed swirling]

19:26.536 --> 19:28.617
[silence]

19:33.698 --> 19:35.038
Eadie?

19:35.138 --> 19:36.758
Eadie, Eadie...

19:36.858 --> 19:39.239
Hey, hey, hey, hey, are you OK?

19:39.339 --> 19:41.319
Yeah, yeah, I'm OK. [clears throat]

19:41.419 --> 19:43.579
Come and sit down.

20:03.103 --> 20:07.564
I get the sense it's not a straight out,
exciting development... the baby.

20:07.664 --> 20:09.124
Babies.

20:09.224 --> 20:11.505
It's complicated.

20:14.745 --> 20:18.266
Lloyd and I disagreed on how much risk
was too much.

20:22.667 --> 20:24.927
I went ahead behind his back.

20:25.027 --> 20:26.508
Why?

20:29.228 --> 20:31.429
Because he would have talked me out of it.

20:32.789 --> 20:36.669
So, if you asked, you would have got
an answer you didn't want?

20:38.150 --> 20:40.030
And then what would have happened?

20:42.071 --> 20:44.531
Then you would have had to ask
another question.

20:44.631 --> 20:48.192
Which is more important -
husband or baby?

20:53.433 --> 20:55.073
-[Lloyd] Knock, knock.

21:00.074 --> 21:01.474
I'll leave you to it.

21:03.435 --> 21:04.435
Hey.

21:05.835 --> 21:06.855
You OK?

21:06.955 --> 21:10.136
Yeah. It's just low blood pressure.

21:10.236 --> 21:11.716
Really?

21:13.877 --> 21:17.377
'Cause it looks like you might have
walked your lowered immune system

21:17.477 --> 21:18.917
right into germ central here.

21:20.278 --> 21:22.018
It's no different from the hospital.

21:22.118 --> 21:23.938
-I know.

21:24.038 --> 21:26.979
And that's probably somewhere you
wouldn't want to hang out in too much

21:27.079 --> 21:28.999
if you were trying to stay healthy either.

21:31.080 --> 21:34.080
[phone rings]

21:39.161 --> 21:41.602
It's um... It's Ivy.

21:44.122 --> 21:45.583
It's OK.

21:45.683 --> 21:47.683
I should duck to the bathroom.

21:52.684 --> 21:54.844
Hey, poppet. What's up?

21:58.165 --> 21:59.685
Uh, hey.

22:00.685 --> 22:02.286
I didn't know you were here.

22:09.487 --> 22:13.268
Things haven't exactly turned out
according to plan, have they?

22:13.368 --> 22:14.808
What are you talking about?

22:15.808 --> 22:17.909
You're pregnant with twins.

22:18.009 --> 22:21.969
A few speed bumps in the old marital
department and you'll sort that out.

22:24.170 --> 22:26.270
We have to tell him you helped me.

22:26.370 --> 22:27.370
No.

22:28.771 --> 22:32.031
No, we definitely do not.

22:32.131 --> 22:35.632
We do. It's just a question of
whether you tell him or I tell him.

22:35.732 --> 22:38.793
Just I wanted...
I wanted to give you the option.

22:38.893 --> 22:41.073
I just think it'll be better for you
if you do...

22:41.173 --> 22:42.793
That's magnanimous of you, Eadie.

22:42.893 --> 22:44.994
There's no way through this
until he knows everything.

22:45.094 --> 22:46.634
Really? Really?

22:46.734 --> 22:52.315
Because when you pitched it at me,
I'm sure you said he would never know.

22:52.415 --> 22:53.755
Yeah, I did...

22:53.855 --> 22:55.356
You know what your problem is, Eadie.

22:55.456 --> 22:58.156
You want what you want
without the consequences.

22:58.256 --> 22:59.717
But that's not how the world works.

22:59.817 --> 23:01.317
There are costs.

23:01.417 --> 23:03.597
I'm not gonna pay for this one.

23:03.697 --> 23:05.598
-[announcer]
All applicants for the Uconica trial,

23:05.698 --> 23:08.858
if your name is called,
please present to Uconica staff.

23:10.779 --> 23:12.779
-[man] Johnson, A. and L.

23:14.419 --> 23:15.900
Davis, T.

23:17.060 --> 23:19.940
Wilson, J. and H.

23:20.821 --> 23:23.861
Thomas, G. and B.

23:24.901 --> 23:27.042
White, S.

23:27.142 --> 23:28.262
-[woman] Next please.

23:29.302 --> 23:34.023
-[man] Latu, R. L. T. and S.

23:34.623 --> 23:37.324
Wang, L. And S.

23:37.424 --> 23:38.844
-[Leroy] Mum?

23:38.944 --> 23:40.644
-[man] Martin, E.

23:40.744 --> 23:42.065
[crowd chatter]

23:43.465 --> 23:45.385
-[man] Nguyen, V.

23:46.505 --> 23:48.546
I just don't understand how this happened.

23:50.426 --> 23:52.087
-[Lloyd] My money's on Lindriquil.

23:52.187 --> 23:54.327
They wanted it.

23:54.427 --> 23:56.407
Maybe they didn't take no for an answer.

23:56.507 --> 23:59.008
-[man] Thomson, J. T. and F.

23:59.108 --> 24:00.088
-[woman] Next please.

24:00.188 --> 24:02.929
[crowd chatter]

24:03.029 --> 24:04.629
-[man] Just hold still.

24:06.989 --> 24:11.990
[solemn music]

24:24.113 --> 24:25.533
[drone buzzing]

24:25.633 --> 24:27.973
-[Shay] Lloyd, we can be doing
better things with our time.

24:28.073 --> 24:31.514
We go back to the lab, we put a bug team
together, we replenish our stocks.

24:32.514 --> 24:34.735
This'll just take a minute.
[shouts] Karima!

24:34.835 --> 24:37.775
You must be feeling like
a proud new mum.

24:37.875 --> 24:40.576
Lloyd, forgive me,
that's not quite tracking.

24:40.676 --> 24:42.136
You'll have to back it up a bit.

24:42.236 --> 24:44.696
You stole our IP
and we just watched jabs roll out.

24:44.796 --> 24:46.477
-[Shay] Shay Levine.

24:47.757 --> 24:49.097
We never met.

24:49.197 --> 24:50.237
Karima.

24:51.198 --> 24:54.058
Shay, you might want to tell your partner,
Lloyd, that it's a restricted trial,

24:54.158 --> 24:55.739
in case he wants to dial back
the drama a little bit.

24:55.839 --> 24:58.179
Oh, you want to get picky about
definitions? Let's call it what it is.

24:58.279 --> 25:01.420
It's an experiment.
These people, they are guinea pigs.

25:01.520 --> 25:02.980
Ends and means, Lloyd.

25:03.080 --> 25:04.340
-Ends and means?

25:04.440 --> 25:07.621
There is no ethical distinction
between ends and means.

25:07.721 --> 25:10.381
This is about
rapid rollout safety protocols.

25:10.481 --> 25:12.302
This is about informed consent.

25:12.402 --> 25:16.462
People do not knowingly risk their health
or their lives for the sake of science.

25:16.562 --> 25:19.263
But their health is not at risk.
Their lives are not at risk.

25:19.363 --> 25:23.344
You two might be curing chagas
one Vietnamese mattress at a time,

25:23.444 --> 25:25.744
but I'm running a bigger race
with bigger risks.

25:25.844 --> 25:27.465
And I am good with that.

25:27.565 --> 25:32.866
How many people in your trial
have residency permits, huh?

25:32.966 --> 25:36.186
Or do you only have volunteers
that are desperate and displaced?

25:36.286 --> 25:37.747
What exactly do you want?

25:37.847 --> 25:38.867
I want you to stop the trial.

25:38.967 --> 25:40.147
That's not gonna happen.

25:40.247 --> 25:41.467
OK, then, publish your results.

25:41.567 --> 25:43.628
If you are so quick to pump these people
full of your shit,

25:43.728 --> 25:46.028
then you publish the blood test results
from the trial.

25:46.128 --> 25:48.689
You show us.
Show us you've got nothing to hide.

25:50.409 --> 25:51.929
Good day, gentlemen.

26:03.931 --> 26:05.412
-[Shay] What now?

26:06.412 --> 26:09.392
I don't know.
We've got to find out how she got it.

26:09.492 --> 26:10.633
[Shay scoffs]

26:10.733 --> 26:12.193
Have you got a better idea?

26:12.293 --> 26:16.314
Yes. We go back to the lab,
we crack a vax without the side effects.

26:16.414 --> 26:18.834
It takes the legs out from underneath her.
She's dead in the water.

26:18.934 --> 26:20.955
Alright, but tomorrow.
I've got to go home.

26:21.055 --> 26:23.295
I've just got to stop thinking
for ten minutes.

26:28.136 --> 26:30.076
[bottles clatter]

26:46.860 --> 26:49.880
[chatter]
-[Ivy] Lucky last, Dad.

26:49.980 --> 26:51.300
-[Lloyd] Thanks, poppet.

26:52.781 --> 26:54.521
-[Ivy] Do you like this part?
-[girl] Yep.

26:54.621 --> 26:55.621
-[Ivy] OK.

26:57.462 --> 26:59.562
-[Dom] Maybe you two should have had
a bridal register.

26:59.662 --> 27:01.282
What was it we all chipped in for -

27:01.382 --> 27:04.883
some breeding llamas
for a village in Bolivia?

27:04.983 --> 27:06.603
-[Lloyd] Yeah, big mistake that.

27:06.703 --> 27:10.484
We love your food, Ive.
Thank you so much for putting it together.

27:10.584 --> 27:12.845
Yeah, I just thought we needed
cold dishes with the heat.

27:12.945 --> 27:15.925
Yeah, yeah. You could always try
turning on the air conditioning.

27:16.025 --> 27:19.846
-[Lloyd] We try to conserve energy
until we actually need it, Dom.

27:19.946 --> 27:22.606
When's that then? When somebody
drops dead from heat exhaustion?

27:22.706 --> 27:24.327
Is that what happened?

27:24.427 --> 27:25.667
-[Archie] Is there more, Ivy?
-[Ivy] Sure is.

27:26.947 --> 27:28.287
Did you do what you promised?

27:28.387 --> 27:30.448
What? Of course. Um...

27:30.548 --> 27:32.268
Are you finished or did you want seconds?

27:34.509 --> 27:36.269
We never went sailing.

27:37.629 --> 27:39.770
-Dad bought a farm.
-Shut up, Cosmo!

27:39.870 --> 27:41.570
-Dad's not well.
-Cosmo...

27:41.670 --> 27:44.971
I promised I wouldn't tell Mum
and you promised you'd go to the doctor.

27:45.071 --> 27:46.931
Why do you always lie about everything?

27:47.031 --> 27:49.551
-Dad wet himself in the car park.
-Cosmo!

27:54.672 --> 28:00.954
[sombre music]

28:09.755 --> 28:12.656
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, it's OK.

28:12.756 --> 28:15.276
It's OK, honey. It's OK.

28:16.276 --> 28:18.037
Why won't he see a doctor?

28:19.677 --> 28:21.618
I don't know, Cos.

28:21.718 --> 28:24.218
He's proud and stubborn.

28:24.318 --> 28:29.399
And maybe he would hate to admit
that he's not perfect.

28:31.159 --> 28:34.200
Is that why he doesn't like me -
'cause I'm not?

28:35.200 --> 28:37.701
No. No, Cos, he loves you.

28:37.801 --> 28:40.641
He loves you so much.

28:43.762 --> 28:45.502
-[Ivy] Highest card loses.
Pick up on three.

28:45.602 --> 28:47.262
-[Ivy] Ready?
-This one? This one?

28:47.362 --> 28:48.463
One, two, three.

28:48.563 --> 28:49.903
-[Archie] Kaboomage!

28:50.003 --> 28:51.543
-[Lloyd] OK, what... How did we go?

28:51.643 --> 28:53.063
[all speak at once]

28:53.163 --> 28:54.824
-[Eadie] How long were you out for?

28:54.924 --> 28:56.364
-[Dom] A few seconds.

28:57.364 --> 28:59.125
How many times has it happened?

you fly the odd helicopter

29:37.052 --> 29:38.912
Is that why you bought a farm?

29:39.012 --> 29:41.993
It's a piece of land on the river.
It's not really a farm.

29:42.093 --> 29:44.233
It's just somewhere to get away
if we need to.

how clean the kids teeth are

30:21.100 --> 30:23.161

then I'm in.
