00:02.698 --> 00:04.482
Hi. I'’m Christy.
I'’m an alcoholic.

00:04.569 --> 00:06.006
GROUP:
Hi, Christy.

00:06.093 --> 00:09.574
And today I am
this many years sober.

00:12.273 --> 00:13.926
I thought this one was hard,

00:14.014 --> 00:16.451
but this one
lived up to its reputation.

00:17.887 --> 00:19.367
There were a lot of really big

00:19.454 --> 00:20.498
challenges this year.

00:20.585 --> 00:23.632
Sorry. Sorry.

00:23.719 --> 00:25.416
And here'’s one now.

00:25.503 --> 00:26.461
What?

00:26.548 --> 00:27.592
Just sit down.

00:29.246 --> 00:30.682
Anyway,

00:30.769 --> 00:32.989
I want to just say
how grateful I am

00:33.076 --> 00:34.904
for all the positive things

00:34.991 --> 00:36.079
that have happened.

00:36.166 --> 00:38.255
I got a promotion at work.

00:39.430 --> 00:40.649
I went back to school.

00:40.736 --> 00:41.998
Got a new place to live.

00:42.085 --> 00:42.999
You'’re welcome.
Bite me.

00:44.957 --> 00:48.004
And, more important
than any of that,

00:48.091 --> 00:50.659
my sponsor Marjorie beat cancer.

00:52.226 --> 00:54.010
And my friend Regina

00:54.097 --> 00:55.794
got an early release from jail.

00:55.881 --> 00:56.882
Thanks to Jesus.

00:56.969 --> 00:59.146
And prison overcrowding.

01:00.321 --> 01:02.453
My sponsee, Jill,

01:02.540 --> 01:04.019
successfully completed rehab.

01:04.107 --> 01:06.022
Twice.

01:08.111 --> 01:12.376
And my ex-husband got a good job

01:12.463 --> 01:14.944
that came with a house
and a girlfriend,

01:15.031 --> 01:17.338
which is great for our son,

01:17.425 --> 01:19.731
but fills me with bitterness
and resentment.

01:22.430 --> 01:23.866
And then there'’s my daughter,

01:23.953 --> 01:25.868
who is getting married.

01:25.955 --> 01:29.872
And... well, let'’s just say
that could go either way.

01:32.092 --> 01:36.357
Best of all, I haven'’t had
a drink or a drug for two years.

01:36.444 --> 01:39.186
And I can'’t tell you
how much that means to me.

01:40.361 --> 01:41.492
To live my life

01:41.579 --> 01:44.365
with dignity and self-respect...

01:44.452 --> 01:45.670
that'’s all I'’ve ever wanted.

01:47.019 --> 01:48.891
Well, that and a boyfriend.

01:51.720 --> 01:53.896
And I'’d like to be
a finalist on The Voice.

01:55.724 --> 01:58.422
And cheat on my boyfriend
with Adam Levine.

01:59.815 --> 02:01.512
Thank you.

02:04.385 --> 02:05.908
Bonnie, everyone
else has shared.

02:05.995 --> 02:07.083
Would you like to go?

02:07.170 --> 02:08.997
Sure, I'’ll go.

02:09.085 --> 02:10.782
Uh, I'’m Bonnie,
I'’m an alcoholic.

02:10.869 --> 02:11.957
GROUP:
Hi, Bonnie.

02:12.044 --> 02:13.133
Well, let'’s see...

02:13.220 --> 02:16.353
I'’m sober 26 days today.

02:16.440 --> 02:17.746
Spent the afternoon

02:17.833 --> 02:19.748
picking up trash on the freeway,

02:19.835 --> 02:22.098
and as far as dignity
and self-respect go,

02:22.185 --> 02:24.318
you never miss
what you didn'’t have.

02:26.058 --> 02:27.234
Thank you.

02:47.602 --> 02:49.734
[doorbell chimes]

02:51.083 --> 02:51.997
Hey.

02:52.084 --> 02:53.390
Hey. Is he ready?

02:53.477 --> 02:55.784
Uh, yeah,

02:55.871 --> 02:57.525
but we got kind of a situation.

02:57.612 --> 02:58.439
ROSCOE:
It'’s not fair!

02:58.526 --> 02:59.962
I'’m not going!

03:00.049 --> 03:01.746
What'’s that about?

03:01.833 --> 03:04.009
Well, I don'’t know
how to put this exactly...

03:04.096 --> 03:05.141
ROSCOE:
I hate it at Mom'’s!

03:05.228 --> 03:06.969
I want to
live here!

03:07.056 --> 03:09.101
There you go.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.060
Are you putting those thoughts
in his head?

03:11.147 --> 03:12.104
What? No.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.758
Swear to God, Baxter,

03:13.845 --> 03:15.195
if you'’re turning
my son against me--

03:15.282 --> 03:16.413
I'’m not doing anything.

03:16.500 --> 03:17.762
Then where is this coming from?

03:17.849 --> 03:19.460
Well, I hate to say it,

03:19.547 --> 03:21.288
but he'’s feeling kind of
ignored at your place,

03:21.375 --> 03:23.028
what with everything going on
with you and your mom.

03:23.115 --> 03:24.378
That'’s ridiculous!

03:24.465 --> 03:26.031
He is never ignored!

03:26.118 --> 03:27.381
That'’s not how he sees it.

03:27.468 --> 03:28.991
Yeah, well, he'’s nine years old,

03:29.078 --> 03:30.122
what the hell does he know?

03:30.210 --> 03:31.472
ROSCOE:
I'’m ten!

03:35.345 --> 03:37.956
Hey, buddy,
are you ready for bed?

03:38.043 --> 03:39.567
You want me to tuck you in?

03:39.654 --> 03:43.266
ROSCOE:
No, just leave me alone.

03:43.353 --> 03:46.487
Roscoe, is there anything I can
do to make you feel better?

03:46.574 --> 03:48.663
ROSCOE:
Yeah. Take me back to Dad'’s.

03:48.750 --> 03:49.925
No!

03:50.012 --> 03:51.448
You'’re staying right here

03:51.535 --> 03:53.668
with your mother
who friggin'’ loves you!

03:53.755 --> 03:55.757
Hey.

03:55.844 --> 03:57.193
Where you been?

03:57.280 --> 03:59.195
I got a ticket.
Can you believe it?

03:59.282 --> 04:00.414
What for?

04:00.501 --> 04:02.154
Texting while biking.

04:04.156 --> 04:05.767
I swear, we live
in a police state.

04:05.854 --> 04:07.638
[sarcastically]:
Yeah.

04:07.725 --> 04:09.771
That'’swhat'’s wrong
with our lives.

04:09.858 --> 04:11.642
What'’s bothering you?

04:11.729 --> 04:13.688
My son doesn'’t want
to live here any more.

04:13.775 --> 04:15.080
What?

04:15.167 --> 04:16.647
He feels ignored.

04:16.733 --> 04:18.301
Yeah, I know
how that goes.

04:18.387 --> 04:19.433
Are you kidding me?

04:20.564 --> 04:21.738
All we do in this house

04:21.826 --> 04:22.914
is cater to you.

04:23.001 --> 04:24.264
What are you talking about?

04:24.351 --> 04:25.526
No one caters to me.

04:25.613 --> 04:26.788
I'’d like to be catered to,

04:26.875 --> 04:28.006
but there'’s no catering.

04:29.399 --> 04:31.227
Mom, every day,

04:31.314 --> 04:32.881
there'’s some new drama going on,

04:32.968 --> 04:34.317
a new crisis.

04:34.404 --> 04:36.624
I'’m not saying I'’m not colorful.

04:36.711 --> 04:38.800
You'’re a black hole,
is what you are!

04:38.887 --> 04:42.064
Nothing can exist near you
without getting sucked in!

04:42.151 --> 04:43.108
BONNIE:
Look who'’s talking.

04:43.195 --> 04:44.806
What about
all your crap?

04:44.893 --> 04:47.461
CHRISTY: I don'’t have crap,
I just have you!

04:47.548 --> 04:50.333
I have a big brown mountain
of you.

04:50.420 --> 04:53.075
Hey, I'’m not the one
who got us evicted

04:53.162 --> 04:54.772
'’cause she gambled away
all the rent money!

04:54.859 --> 04:56.383
Oh, my God!

04:56.470 --> 04:58.385
When are you gonna stop
going back to that?

04:58.472 --> 04:59.951
When it stops
making you feel bad.

05:00.038 --> 05:02.650
Yeah, well, I feel great.

05:02.737 --> 05:04.434
And you know why?

05:04.521 --> 05:07.219
Unlike you, I have
two years of sobriety!

05:07.307 --> 05:10.310
And a valid
drivers'’ license!

05:10.397 --> 05:11.789
Yeah?

05:11.876 --> 05:14.096
I have no carbon footprint,

05:14.183 --> 05:15.315
so suck on that!

05:33.463 --> 05:35.117
[sighs wearily]

06:20.597 --> 06:22.382
Are you insane?

06:22.469 --> 06:24.906
Yeah, so be careful.

06:24.993 --> 06:27.387
You better fix that window
first thing in the morning.

06:27.474 --> 06:28.866
Or what?
Or...

06:30.172 --> 06:31.521
God, I hate you sometimes.

06:34.872 --> 06:36.744
[phone buzzing]

06:39.660 --> 06:42.445
Hey, Marjorie, everything okay?

06:42.532 --> 06:43.446
What?

06:43.533 --> 06:45.753
Oh, my God.

06:45.840 --> 06:47.972
I'’ll... I'’ll be right over.What happened?

06:48.059 --> 06:50.105
Roscoe just showed up
at her house.

06:50.192 --> 06:51.411
I thought he was
in his room.

06:51.498 --> 06:52.716
Me, too.

06:52.803 --> 06:53.978
Wait, I'’m coming
with you.

06:54.065 --> 06:55.153
It'’s all right, I got it.

06:55.240 --> 06:56.154
But I want to help.

06:56.241 --> 06:57.721
You want to help?

06:57.808 --> 06:59.854
Change every single thing
about yourself.

07:03.771 --> 07:05.512
[front door shuts]

07:05.599 --> 07:07.557
Christy, grab my alarm clock!

07:14.434 --> 07:16.000
Where is he?

07:16.087 --> 07:19.743
Oh, God, Roscoe,
you scared the hell out of me!

07:19.830 --> 07:21.484
I'’m fine.
You'’re fine?

07:21.571 --> 07:23.355
Do you know what
could'’ve happened to you?

07:23.443 --> 07:24.879
You could'’ve
gotten kidnapped,

07:24.966 --> 07:26.489
you could'’ve been
hit by a truck,

07:26.576 --> 07:27.664
you could'’ve been
eaten by coyotes!

07:27.751 --> 07:29.187
Christy...

07:29.274 --> 07:31.276
coyote is the "C" word
around here.

07:33.627 --> 07:35.019
Sorry.

07:35.106 --> 07:38.022
Okay, what'’s going on?

07:38.109 --> 07:39.546
Why did you come
to Marjorie'’s?

07:39.633 --> 07:40.808
I thought she could help me.

07:40.895 --> 07:42.331
Help you do what?

07:42.418 --> 07:43.985
I want to live
with Dad and Candace

07:44.072 --> 07:45.377
and since you won'’t
listen to me,

07:45.465 --> 07:46.640
maybe you'’d listen to her.

07:46.727 --> 07:48.380
Why would I
listen to her?

07:48.468 --> 07:49.860
'’Cause she'’s your sponsor

07:49.947 --> 07:51.775
at the Alcoholics
and the Anonymous.

07:54.561 --> 07:57.520
Roscoe, why don'’t you go
watch TV in the other room?

07:57.607 --> 07:58.521
Let me talk to your mom.

07:58.608 --> 08:00.480
Good luck.

08:03.178 --> 08:05.136
Marjorie, I'’ve already
been through this with him.

08:05.223 --> 08:06.094
It'’s not gonna happen.

08:06.181 --> 08:07.095
[sneezes]

08:07.182 --> 08:08.705
Bless you.

08:08.792 --> 08:11.708
Okay, just know that
if you fight him on this,

08:11.795 --> 08:13.580
he'’s gonna resent you.

08:13.667 --> 08:16.234
I'’m his mother.
He'’s gonna resent me anyway.

08:16.321 --> 08:18.846
You want me to put the cats
in another room?

08:18.933 --> 08:22.240
[sighs] It'’s done.

08:22.327 --> 08:25.505
Why not try it
for a little while?

08:25.592 --> 08:26.810
He'’s gonna come back.

08:26.897 --> 08:27.898
How do you know?

08:27.985 --> 08:29.683
'’Cause he loves you.

08:29.770 --> 08:31.162
He tell you that?

08:31.249 --> 08:33.861
We'’re getting off the point.

08:33.948 --> 08:36.558
He'’s not wrong
about you and Bonnie.

08:36.645 --> 08:39.736
That house has not been
a happy place for a little boy.

08:39.823 --> 08:42.783
[sighs]

08:42.870 --> 08:44.393
A couple of hours ago,

08:44.480 --> 08:46.700
I was celebrating
two years of sobriety,

08:46.787 --> 08:49.224
talking about all the great
things that have happened.

08:49.311 --> 08:50.617
Now this.

08:52.314 --> 08:54.882
You know, his dad
still smokes pot.

08:54.969 --> 08:58.494
So did the last three
presidents.

08:58.581 --> 09:00.278
Try again.

09:02.106 --> 09:04.979
Candace'’s family belongs
to a fancy country club.

09:05.066 --> 09:08.417
They have Sunday brunch,
play golf, tennis.

09:08.504 --> 09:12.116
I'’m sorry, are you arguing
for or against?

09:12.203 --> 09:16.599
Come on, back me up here,
I'’m the lovable underdog!

09:16.686 --> 09:18.601
I am backing you up.

09:18.688 --> 09:20.864
Right now, this seems like
the way to go.

09:20.951 --> 09:22.953
How can you say that?

09:23.040 --> 09:25.565
'’Cause we don'’t know
the end of the story.

09:25.652 --> 09:28.045
Yeah, well, in this chapter,

09:28.132 --> 09:29.699
the hero needs a drink.

09:29.786 --> 09:32.702
What makes you think
you'’re the hero?

09:41.276 --> 09:42.190
Hey.

09:42.277 --> 09:44.192
Whatcha doing?

09:44.279 --> 09:46.150
Pimpin'’ my ride.

09:48.152 --> 09:49.414
You drop Roscoe off?

09:49.501 --> 09:50.894
Yep.

09:50.981 --> 09:52.200
How'’d it go?

09:52.287 --> 09:55.333
He was happy, I cried,

09:55.420 --> 09:57.335
stupid Candace hugged me,

09:57.422 --> 09:59.860
and on the way to my car,

09:59.947 --> 10:02.514
I "accidentally"
knocked over her mailbox.

10:02.602 --> 10:03.690
Really?

10:03.777 --> 10:05.300
It was a tiny replica of her

10:05.387 --> 10:07.389
actual house;
it needed to be done.

10:07.476 --> 10:10.348
You want to go
grab a bite to eat?

10:10.435 --> 10:13.003
No. I have to pack.

10:13.090 --> 10:14.309
What for?

10:14.396 --> 10:16.528
I'’m moving out.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.096
What?!Yeah,

10:19.183 --> 10:22.186
I think Roscoe'’s
got the right idea.

10:22.273 --> 10:25.407
The road to a happy life
leads away from your mother.

10:25.494 --> 10:27.627
You can'’t be serious.
You'’re gonna blame me

10:27.714 --> 10:29.716
'’cause your son
wants to get away from you?

10:29.803 --> 10:31.674
Um... yeah.

10:34.329 --> 10:36.244
Christy, wait a minute.

10:36.331 --> 10:39.813
You want to point the finger
at somebody, why not Baxter?

10:39.900 --> 10:42.032
What did he do?He...

10:42.119 --> 10:44.469
uh, you know,
he got his life together.

10:44.556 --> 10:45.949
You think Roscoe
would be begging

10:46.036 --> 10:48.169
to live in a van
under a bridge?

10:48.256 --> 10:50.345
The words, when they'’re
coming out of your mouth,

10:50.432 --> 10:51.999
can you smell them?

10:52.086 --> 10:54.610
Can you get a whiff
of that barnyard odor?

10:54.697 --> 10:56.873
Okay, fine,
where you gonna go?

10:56.960 --> 10:59.267
Jill said I could
stay with her and Regina

10:59.354 --> 11:00.834
while I look for an apartment.

11:00.921 --> 11:02.444
There are apartments
in this building.

11:02.531 --> 11:05.273
There are apartments
in this building.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.928
Wow, you really
took a lot of drugs.

11:08.015 --> 11:09.407
No.

11:09.494 --> 11:10.931
I am putting my foot down.

11:11.018 --> 11:12.846
You are not leaving.

11:12.933 --> 11:14.412
Can'’t stop me, Mom.

11:14.499 --> 11:16.414
We'’ll see about that.

11:27.034 --> 11:28.600
Really?

11:28.688 --> 11:30.559
Yeah, I didn'’t think it through.

11:32.866 --> 11:35.520
I appreciate you letting me
stay her for a few days.

11:35.607 --> 11:38.610
Oh, believe me, I am
so happy you'’re here.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.264
We can go
shopping together,

11:40.351 --> 11:42.049
get our nails done.

11:42.136 --> 11:43.311
You know, fun
girl stuff.

11:43.398 --> 11:45.269
Oh, that sounds amazing.

11:45.356 --> 11:47.576
You know what'’s amazing?
Jesus.

11:48.664 --> 11:50.448
Here we go.

11:50.535 --> 11:53.103
Christy, there'’s a hole
in your heart.

11:53.190 --> 11:54.888
And what'’s gonna fill it--
spending Jill'’s money

11:54.975 --> 11:56.541
or spending time with God?

11:56.628 --> 11:58.456
Well,

11:58.543 --> 12:00.981
I'’d be happy
to give both a try.

12:01.068 --> 12:02.765
It'’s a big hole.

12:04.071 --> 12:05.637
Regina, can we please just

12:05.725 --> 12:08.162
give the religion thing
a break for just one day?

12:08.249 --> 12:10.381
The religion thing?

12:10.468 --> 12:11.905
Is that what we call
the miracle

12:11.992 --> 12:13.602
that saved me
when I was in prison?

12:13.689 --> 12:15.256
No.

12:15.343 --> 12:17.911
Is that what we call
the eternal salvation

12:17.998 --> 12:19.651
that'’s ours for the asking?

12:19.739 --> 12:21.697
No.Is that what we call
the Kingdom of Heaven

12:21.784 --> 12:24.526
that surrounds us
but we'’re too blind to see?

12:24.613 --> 12:26.267
Oh, come on!

12:26.354 --> 12:27.834
Why can'’t
the Kingdom of Heaven

12:27.921 --> 12:29.966
be Saks Fifth Avenue?

12:30.967 --> 12:32.577
Help me out here.

12:32.664 --> 12:35.276
Well, it would be nice
to get a pedicure,

12:35.363 --> 12:36.756
so I could wear sandals.

12:38.496 --> 12:40.890
That'’s what
your soul needs-- sandals?

12:40.977 --> 12:42.457
It is what Jesus wore.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.025
We need to pray.

12:45.112 --> 12:46.678
Do we really?Yeah.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.724
The Voiceis on.

12:48.811 --> 12:50.378
Now.

12:50.465 --> 12:52.119
BOTH:
Okay.

12:54.077 --> 12:55.992
Heavenly Father,
I want to thank You

12:56.079 --> 12:58.865
for entrusting me
with bringing Your words

12:58.952 --> 13:00.910
to those who cannot hear them.

13:00.997 --> 13:02.694
Help them seek comfort in You

13:02.782 --> 13:04.914
and not material things.

13:05.001 --> 13:08.091
[whispers]: She prays
the fun out of everything.

13:08.178 --> 13:10.920
And thank You for bringing
Christy under our roof

13:11.007 --> 13:13.662
so that I can usher her
into the warm embrace

13:13.749 --> 13:15.664
of Your everlasting love.

13:15.751 --> 13:17.013
Run.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.278
It'’s a foldout couch, so...

13:21.365 --> 13:23.367
I'’m not sure how
comfortable it is.

13:23.454 --> 13:24.978
Oh, it'’s fine, thanks.

13:25.065 --> 13:26.457
Really appreciate it.

13:26.544 --> 13:28.459
I'’ll go get
some sheets and blankets.

13:28.546 --> 13:30.635
Oh, no, no, I'’ll-I'’ll do it,
y-you talk to your mom.

13:30.722 --> 13:32.681
No, no, I got it.

13:35.249 --> 13:37.251
We'’ll be right back.

13:37.338 --> 13:40.471
[door closes]GREGORY: Look, how long

13:40.558 --> 13:42.212
are we stuck with her?VIOLET:
I don'’t know-- until she

13:42.299 --> 13:44.998
gets her life together.GREGORY:
Oh. So, forever.

13:45.085 --> 13:46.608
[lighter clicks]VIOLET:
What are you doing?

13:46.695 --> 13:48.784
GREGORY:
Smoking a joint.

13:48.871 --> 13:50.917
VIOLET:
You can'’t smoke a joint with
her here, she'’s in recovery.

13:51.004 --> 13:52.570
GREGORY: Really?
I got to live with you

13:52.657 --> 13:55.399
and your mother,
and I can'’t get high?

14:00.578 --> 14:03.320
[doorbell chimes]

14:10.806 --> 14:13.287
JILL:
Hi, Bonnie. Cute hat.

14:13.374 --> 14:14.766
Yeah, thanks.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.420
Tell Christy
I want to talk to her.

14:16.507 --> 14:18.074
Oh, she'’s not here.

14:18.161 --> 14:19.815
She decided to stay
at her daughter'’s.

14:19.902 --> 14:21.382
Aw, damn.

14:21.469 --> 14:24.994
That'’s two hills
and a freeway.

14:25.081 --> 14:27.344
You want to come in
and pray with me and Regina?

14:27.431 --> 14:29.172
No, thanks.

14:29.259 --> 14:31.435
Somebody always gets
underserved in a three-way.

14:33.698 --> 14:35.570
JILL [whispers]:
Please take me with you.

14:38.660 --> 14:39.835
All comfy?

14:39.922 --> 14:42.969
Yeah. Thanks, Marjorie.

14:43.056 --> 14:44.709
I really appreciate this.

14:44.796 --> 14:46.320
You'’re always welcome here.

14:46.407 --> 14:47.582
Sweet dreams.

14:49.236 --> 14:51.455
Marjorie, are you
coming back to bed?

14:52.892 --> 14:54.676
Be right there, Victor.

14:54.763 --> 14:57.418
Oh, God, you didn'’t
say you had company.

14:57.505 --> 14:59.681
It'’s okay, you'’re not
bothering us.

14:59.768 --> 15:01.465
You'’re bothering me.

15:03.119 --> 15:05.208
He'’s just kidding.
Come on, Victor.

15:05.295 --> 15:07.907
Not kidding.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.475
[door closes]

15:14.478 --> 15:16.306
PERUGIAN:
Does this mean we
can'’t make love?

15:19.396 --> 15:21.964
MARJORIE:
Of course we can, we
just have to be quiet.

15:25.315 --> 15:26.664
[sighs]

15:46.641 --> 15:48.512
[rhythmic squeaking
in distance]

15:53.735 --> 15:55.302
Yeah, this isn'’t gonna work.

16:07.705 --> 16:09.620
Oh, God, the big one.

16:09.707 --> 16:12.406
Is my daughter here?

16:12.493 --> 16:15.104
No, she left.Oh. You know where she went?

16:15.191 --> 16:17.237
I do not.Who'’s sleeping on the couch?

16:18.803 --> 16:20.240
Me.

16:20.327 --> 16:22.198
Oh.

16:23.634 --> 16:25.506
Well, welcome to the family.

16:42.436 --> 16:45.265
I guess we both knew
this day would come.

16:45.352 --> 16:47.571
Nope.

16:49.704 --> 16:51.575
You'’ll be back.Nope.

17:04.501 --> 17:06.415
[sighs]

17:29.309 --> 17:31.180
God help me, I want a cat.

17:36.620 --> 17:37.708
Hey.

17:37.795 --> 17:40.059
[gasps]

17:40.146 --> 17:41.973
Hello.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.628
Where were you?

17:44.715 --> 17:48.023
I went out for a little
evening bike ride.

17:50.286 --> 17:52.158
What brings you by?

17:54.769 --> 17:57.163
I'’ve decided to forgive you.

17:58.686 --> 18:00.557
Really? How far
back we going?

18:00.644 --> 18:02.298
I don'’t know, Mom.'’Cause I
really think

18:02.385 --> 18:03.908
high school'’s where
we went off the rails.

18:03.995 --> 18:05.910
Fine, whatever.

18:09.784 --> 18:12.047
I also wanted to apologize.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.964
It'’s not your fault
about Roscoe.

18:17.313 --> 18:19.620
Him not wanting to be here

18:19.707 --> 18:22.057
just broke my heart.

18:22.144 --> 18:24.929
And the only way I could deal
with it was by blaming you.

18:25.016 --> 18:27.367
I get it.

18:30.283 --> 18:33.242
My kid looked me in the eye

18:33.329 --> 18:35.331
and he said he didn'’t
want to live with me.

18:37.768 --> 18:39.944
Do you have any idea
how much that hurts?

18:40.031 --> 18:42.425
Actually, I do.

18:50.825 --> 18:53.871
I'’ve been trying so hard
to be a good mom.

18:55.656 --> 18:57.788
And it'’s just not enough.

18:57.875 --> 18:59.573
Oh, baby.

18:59.660 --> 19:01.618
I know it'’s not
saying much,

19:01.705 --> 19:03.359
but you'’re a better
mother to your children

19:03.446 --> 19:05.709
than I ever was to you.

19:05.796 --> 19:08.277
You'’re right,
it'’s not saying much.

19:10.105 --> 19:12.716
But... thank you.

19:12.803 --> 19:15.415
I guarantee you'’ll get
another chance with Roscoe.

19:15.502 --> 19:17.330
That'’s what Marjorie said.

19:17.417 --> 19:20.159
It'’s true. How many
chances have you and I had?

19:20.246 --> 19:23.684
Oh, God, that'’s depressing.

19:23.771 --> 19:25.642
We'’ll do it together.

19:25.729 --> 19:27.905
We'’ll make this a great place
for Roscoe to grow up.

19:27.992 --> 19:29.951
How?

19:30.038 --> 19:31.648
He'’s got a dog over there

19:31.735 --> 19:35.522
and a pool and a stepmom
who doesn'’t work two jobs.

19:35.609 --> 19:39.134
Uh... you ever think
about having another kid?

19:40.614 --> 19:42.093
Kidding.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.834
We'’ll figure it out.

19:43.921 --> 19:46.315
I hope so.

19:51.799 --> 19:53.235
Hey, on the bright side,

19:53.322 --> 19:54.932
I think Violet might
be coming back.

20:01.025 --> 20:03.593
Oh, that might be my fault, too.
