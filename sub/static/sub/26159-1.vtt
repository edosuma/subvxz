00:38.145 --> 00:40.544

the Ionosphere.</i>

<i>When we're looking
up at the stars in the sky,</i>

00:41.848 --> 00:43.915
<i>we are actually
looking into the past.</i>

00:43.917 --> 00:45.884
<i>We know that light
travels at about</i>

00:45.886 --> 00:47.918
<i>300 million
meters per second.</i>

00:47.920 --> 00:50.088
<i>While that is certainly
fast by normal standards,</i>

00:50.090 --> 00:52.723
<i>in the context of
the size of the universe...</i>

00:52.725 --> 00:55.593
<i>...solar

<i>a shower of incoming

<i>Schwarzschild's

01:10.710 --> 01:12.142
<i>You know, I think
the more important question</i>

01:12.144 --> 01:14.845
<i>we should be asking
is "what is time?"</i>

01:47.680 --> 01:49.613
<i>Could life
exist on other planets</i>

01:49.615 --> 01:51.148
<i>in our solar system?</i>

01:51.150 --> 01:55.153
<i>Is Mars the most likely
place for it to develop?</i>

01:55.155 --> 01:58.556
<i>Dr. Harold Grindstaff
thinks</i>

01:58.558 --> 01:59.990
<i>in order to answer
that question</i>

01:59.992 --> 02:01.960
<i>we may want to look
a bit further out.</i>

02:01.962 --> 02:04.829
<i>As we travel
past the terrestrial planets</i>

02:04.831 --> 02:07.966
<i>in our solar system,
we reach the Jovian planets,</i>

02:07.968 --> 02:10.167
<i>Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus, and Neptune.</i>

02:10.169 --> 02:13.039
<i>These planets are
massive in size...</i>

02:20.881 --> 02:23.148
Eric, my man, you're
looking good this morning.

02:23.150 --> 02:24.848
What can I do
for you, Ben?

02:24.850 --> 02:27.918
It's official.
Practor Financial is now ours.

02:27.920 --> 02:29.654
All right!
Well, congratulations.

02:29.656 --> 02:30.822
That's huge.

02:30.824 --> 02:32.222
And you are in luck,
my friend.

02:32.224 --> 02:34.826
I'm giving you first
pick of the new clients.

02:34.828 --> 02:37.127
Yeah?

02:37.129 --> 02:38.129
What's the catch?

02:38.131 --> 02:39.631
Aw, catch?

02:39.633 --> 02:41.031
Come on, Eric,
don't be so cynical.

02:41.033 --> 02:42.866
Don't bullshit me, Ben.
I know how you operate.

02:42.868 --> 02:44.135
What's the catch?

02:44.137 --> 02:46.905
Okay, it's
really quite simple.

02:46.907 --> 02:48.806
Yes, it's a boutique
operation,

02:48.808 --> 02:51.375
but their clientele are
mostly the elderly type.

02:51.377 --> 02:52.876
You know, the kind
who don't know what to do

02:52.878 --> 02:54.613
with their money,
so they hand it over to

02:54.615 --> 02:55.981
the portfolio manager
to manage until it's time

02:55.983 --> 02:58.215
to pass it down to the kids.
The best type.

02:58.217 --> 02:59.883
That's great.
That sounds wonderful.

02:59.885 --> 03:01.219
What are you
not telling me?

03:01.221 --> 03:02.887
I just need you to spend
a couple of weeks with...

03:02.889 --> 03:04.322
No, no, no,
hell, no!

03:04.324 --> 03:05.990
You are not doing
that shit to me again, okay?

03:05.992 --> 03:07.392
Why do I always
have to be the one

03:07.394 --> 03:09.227
to take the new
acquisitions passdowns?

03:09.229 --> 03:11.296
You know the last guy,
he pestered me non-stop

03:11.298 --> 03:12.998
to join his fucking
"Dungeons & Dragons" group.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.933
Okay? I had to
spend two weekends,

03:14.935 --> 03:17.202
two weekends, Ben,
in some guy's ratty-ass

03:17.204 --> 03:19.169
apartment with a bunch
of his loser-ass friends

03:19.171 --> 03:21.905
who look like Milt from
"Office Space," all right?

03:21.907 --> 03:23.941
They're arguing over whether,
you know, a dwarf or an elf

03:23.943 --> 03:25.844
makes a better cleric. I'm not
doing that shit again, okay?

03:25.846 --> 03:28.346
Okay, okay,
This time the "he" is a "she"

03:28.348 --> 03:30.180
and they don't play
"Dungeons & Dragons."

03:30.182 --> 03:31.181
What are you doing?

03:31.183 --> 03:32.716
Don't... not the numbers.

03:32.718 --> 03:34.185
Do you have any idea
what two weeks is to me?

03:34.187 --> 03:35.754
Let me tell
you something,

03:35.756 --> 03:37.155
I bring home $7,000
a week in commissions.

03:37.157 --> 03:38.722
That's not including
salary, all right?

03:38.724 --> 03:40.225
You know how much money
that is to this firm?

03:40.227 --> 03:41.925
Now you want me to
sift through

03:41.927 --> 03:43.894
some worthless client's
portfolio under the guise

03:43.896 --> 03:46.197
that you're actually
doing me a favor, right?

03:46.199 --> 03:48.032
You and I both know
there's one client

03:48.034 --> 03:49.400
in there,
maybe two if we're lucky,

03:49.402 --> 03:50.834
that's actually worth
my time to manage.

03:50.836 --> 03:52.904
This is intern work, Ben,

03:52.906 --> 03:55.373
not something for
your best employee.

03:55.375 --> 03:58.810
You know, maybe I've failed to
properly explain to you

03:58.812 --> 04:01.145
the boss-employee
relationship.

04:01.147 --> 04:03.881
I tell you what to do,
and you do it.

04:03.883 --> 04:06.017
It's really that simple.

04:06.019 --> 04:07.886
Okay, so that's how
we're gonna play this, right?

04:07.888 --> 04:09.320
You should take notes.

04:09.322 --> 04:11.388
Although it may seem to
you that I got the job of

04:11.390 --> 04:13.991
senior vice president
of accounts based solely

04:13.993 --> 04:16.293
on my dashing good looks,
I actually knew when to

04:16.295 --> 04:17.998
shut the fuck up
and do what I was told.

04:20.333 --> 04:23.300
Okay, no, I get it, you want me to be
a team player, I'll be a team player.

04:23.302 --> 04:26.937
- That's all I'm asking.
- All right.

04:26.939 --> 04:28.206
Hey, so, I've
been thinking, right?

04:28.208 --> 04:29.343
You should keep
that up, Kal.

04:30.374 --> 04:30.375
People appreciate
a thinking man.

04:30.377 --> 04:32.010
Oh, you will appreciate it.

04:32.012 --> 04:34.012
So there are seven billion
people in this world,

04:34.014 --> 04:36.346
and every two seconds,
somebody dies.

04:36.348 --> 04:38.315
That means in 116 years,

04:38.317 --> 04:41.185
everyone that's alive right
now will be gone!

04:41.187 --> 04:44.889
That's 2129, man.
That is coming fast.

04:44.891 --> 04:46.925
Yeah, yeah. You figured
that whole thing out

04:46.927 --> 04:48.425
while you were
waiting for me?

04:48.427 --> 04:50.360
Are you kidding me?
That's some extreme math.

04:50.362 --> 04:52.130
It took me
the entire day.

04:52.132 --> 04:54.231
Only Kal doesn't
work on Mondays.

04:54.233 --> 04:57.368
What's with you?

04:57.370 --> 05:00.872
I'm sorry, my boss has got another
one of his brilliant ideas.

05:00.874 --> 05:03.875
We're taking clients from a
smaller firm so he's got this...

05:03.877 --> 05:05.343
this chick that's
gonna come in and,

05:05.345 --> 05:06.945
I don't know,
teach me how to cater

05:06.947 --> 05:08.146
to their upper echelon's
elderly, I guess?

05:08.148 --> 05:09.313
I don't know.

05:09.315 --> 05:11.182
Listen to you, man.

05:11.184 --> 05:14.418
You're like the epitome
of white people problems.

05:14.420 --> 05:16.421
I'm a rich white male.
What do you expect?

05:16.423 --> 05:18.089
Well, hey,
Tom Hanks was a rich white male

05:18.091 --> 05:21.192
and he figured out a way
to connect with the common folk.

05:21.194 --> 05:23.428
Yeah.
Yeah, but he was retarded.

05:23.430 --> 05:25.829
Whoa! You would
lose your mind too

05:25.831 --> 05:27.832
if you were on that
island for that long.

05:27.834 --> 05:30.435
- Oh, you're talking "Castaway".
- Yes!

05:30.437 --> 05:33.471
And you know Forrest Gump
was not retarded, either.

05:33.473 --> 05:34.772
I learned more
from that man

05:34.774 --> 05:36.007
than I ever did
in any school.

05:36.009 --> 05:37.776
Yeah, I actually believe that,
Kal,

05:37.778 --> 05:39.176
but maybe you should have
paid more attention

05:39.178 --> 05:40.445
and you could've figured out
that 2129 thing

05:40.447 --> 05:42.346
before it was too late.

05:42.348 --> 05:44.082
I don't even know why you're
still working at that job.

05:44.084 --> 05:46.317
I mean, I always hear you
complaining about it.

05:46.319 --> 05:49.187
I don't know. I mean,
it pays well, I like money.

05:49.189 --> 05:51.421
You like money so
much you never spend it?

05:51.423 --> 05:52.557
What are you
talking about?

05:52.559 --> 05:54.125
I spend money
all the time.

05:54.127 --> 05:55.827
Besides, it's better to have it
and not need it

05:55.829 --> 05:57.027
than need it
and not have it.

05:57.029 --> 05:58.897
Okay, you made more
money this year

05:58.899 --> 06:01.265
than I'll probably ever make
in my entire lifetime.

06:01.267 --> 06:03.801
- Probably.
- Yet you live in a small-ass apartment,

06:03.803 --> 06:06.137
you own one car, you never
come to Magic Mountain...

06:06.139 --> 06:09.339
The apartment is nice and who
needs more than one car?

06:09.341 --> 06:12.343
Besides, like I said,
I'm saving it, you know?

06:12.345 --> 06:14.115
You never know when
you might need it.

06:16.949 --> 06:18.418
It's from the lady.

06:22.588 --> 06:25.824
All right, bring it in here.
What do you think?

06:25.826 --> 06:28.058
Well, she was already
here when I got here...

06:28.060 --> 06:29.293
Okay.

06:29.295 --> 06:30.961
...cute, alone,
easy pickings, right?

06:30.963 --> 06:33.096
Check out the wedding ring.

06:33.098 --> 06:34.899
There's always more
than meets the eye, man.

06:34.901 --> 06:36.300
You want
the real report?

06:36.302 --> 06:38.336
Recent divorcee,
can't quite seem

06:38.338 --> 06:41.372
to let it go...
tch, tch, tch.

06:41.374 --> 06:43.942
You're amazing,

06:43.944 --> 06:45.476
I'm gonna go see
if you're right.

06:45.478 --> 06:47.213
- Don't say I didn't warn you.
- All right.

06:52.017 --> 06:53.584
Dude, what
happened out there?

06:53.586 --> 06:57.221
She was, like,
all over you.

06:57.223 --> 06:59.022
She bored me.

06:59.024 --> 07:01.860
Bored you? Sheesh,
I wish I could be bored

07:01.862 --> 07:04.298
by someone who
looks like that.

07:07.067 --> 07:10.034
<i>Edwin Hubble used
spectral shifts in the galaxy</i>

07:10.036 --> 07:14.339
<i>to determine that the universe
is constantly expanding.</i>

07:14.341 --> 07:17.341
<i>Hubble's Law raises some
interesting questions.</i>

07:17.343 --> 07:19.243
<i>If galaxies are in fact</i>

07:19.245 --> 07:21.546
<i>receding from us
in all directions,</i>

07:21.548 --> 07:23.313
<i>does that mean that we are</i>

07:23.315 --> 07:25.550
<i>at the center
of the universe?</i>

07:25.552 --> 07:27.618
Eric, allow me to
introduce you to...

07:27.620 --> 07:30.053
Julia Practor,
nice to meet you.

07:30.055 --> 07:33.390
Eric Laziter, team player.

07:33.392 --> 07:36.362
Well, I'll let you
two get acquainted.

07:38.230 --> 07:40.632
So what I was thinking
is we could get started off...

07:40.634 --> 07:42.634
You know what we could do is
just do this thing the easy way.

07:42.636 --> 07:44.569
Just pile everything I'm gonna
need right here on the desk.

07:44.571 --> 07:45.904
I'll just take care of
it all on my own,

07:45.906 --> 07:47.171
if that's okay with you.

07:47.173 --> 07:49.973
Hey, that wasn't
part of the deal.

07:49.975 --> 07:54.012
I was very clear with Ben about what
the turnover processes would entail.

07:54.014 --> 07:55.012
Is this going
to be a problem?

07:55.014 --> 07:57.147
No.
No, not at all.

07:57.149 --> 07:59.319
Let's dig in. Go ahead and have a seat.
We'll do this together.

08:03.355 --> 08:05.959
So, um, where do you
want to get started?

08:10.963 --> 08:13.231
Did you make a note on there about
sticking with market neutral...

08:13.233 --> 08:15.500
Strategies,
I got it, yeah.

08:15.502 --> 08:17.702
Okay, 'cause I'm just trying to make
sure that we keep everything...

08:17.704 --> 08:20.938
I'm very good at my job,
I got it. I know what I'm doing.

08:20.940 --> 08:22.208
Just keep moving.

08:24.511 --> 08:26.043
You know what?

08:26.045 --> 08:27.512
Actually, it's
getting really late.

08:27.514 --> 08:29.079
Um, why don't we just
just pick this back up

08:29.081 --> 08:30.416
in the morning?

08:33.219 --> 08:35.085
Or we could take
a combat nap

08:35.087 --> 08:37.955
in the break room.

08:37.957 --> 08:39.190
That was a joke.

08:39.192 --> 08:44.160
Uh, wow,
you don't like me, do you?

08:44.163 --> 08:45.164
I don't know you.

08:47.366 --> 08:49.499
<i>If you really want
to understand the planets</i>

08:49.501 --> 08:51.301
<i>in our solar system,
you first need to</i>

08:51.303 --> 08:54.004
<i>look at what different
types of planets exist.</i>

08:54.006 --> 08:56.974
<i>Okay, so you've got
terrestrial planets, right?</i>

08:56.976 --> 08:58.608
<i>Those are planets
that share physical</i>

08:58.610 --> 09:01.646
<i>and chemical characteristics
with our own planet.</i>

09:01.648 --> 09:05.349
<i>And these planets with these
specific characteristics,</i>

09:05.351 --> 09:09.753
<i>okay, you've got Venus, Mars,
Mercury, and, of course, Earth.</i>

09:09.755 --> 09:13.690
Oh, uh, hold on. Actually we haven't
spoken about Jackson McHale yet.

09:13.692 --> 09:15.962
Uh, Jackson McHale,
got him.

09:18.063 --> 09:20.765
Or Byron Evans,
Judith Szymankowicz,

09:20.767 --> 09:22.266
the Emorys.

09:22.268 --> 09:25.636
Got him, got her,
and I got them.

09:25.638 --> 09:27.504
Okay, stop, all right?
This isn't fair.

09:27.506 --> 09:29.507
This is
important to me.

09:29.509 --> 09:31.776
It was part of the deal, we would
talk about every client individually

09:31.778 --> 09:34.145
because you're not going to pick
up on the subtleties on your own.

09:34.147 --> 09:37.017
Okay, all right.
Um...

09:38.717 --> 09:40.550
Jackson McHale, all right,

09:40.552 --> 09:45.690
64 years old,
$780,000 net worth,

09:45.692 --> 09:47.224
largest stock holding
is Intel,

09:47.226 --> 09:49.093
and his hobbies include
stamp collecting,

09:49.095 --> 09:52.095
fishing, and spending time
with his grandkids, all right?

09:52.097 --> 09:54.031
Byron Evans...
Byron Evans is a character.

09:54.033 --> 09:56.467
74 years young,
likes the ponies,

09:56.469 --> 09:59.369
horse racing,
and fast women.

09:59.371 --> 10:01.138
Maybe that's why
he's not worth so much.

10:01.140 --> 10:03.074
Judith Szymankowicz.

10:03.076 --> 10:05.609
This woman,
$600K net worth, right?

10:05.611 --> 10:07.512
Clearly not giving her
proper guidance

10:07.514 --> 10:09.247
because in the 12 years that
she's been with your company,

10:09.249 --> 10:11.581
she's only seen a 5.7%
return on her investment.

10:11.583 --> 10:14.051
I like to think I could have at
least come close to doubling that.

10:14.053 --> 10:16.186
And then we have
the Emorys, right?

10:16.188 --> 10:19.523
Robert, the patriarch, retired
after 42 years at Raytheon,

10:19.525 --> 10:21.626
made a fortune in dotcoms,

10:21.628 --> 10:22.826
got out before
the bubble burst,

10:22.828 --> 10:24.829
got two kids, both sons,
loves them both.

10:24.831 --> 10:27.265
Mitch owns a small chain
of seafood restaurants

10:27.267 --> 10:29.767
in San Diego County
and Hal...

10:29.769 --> 10:33.805
is a real estate agent
in San Luis Obispo.

10:33.807 --> 10:37.074
Good family.
What else is there to know?

10:37.076 --> 10:38.443
I'm impressed...

10:38.445 --> 10:40.210
Well, I worked from
home last night.

10:40.212 --> 10:41.778
It's not
that big of a deal.

10:41.780 --> 10:44.714
...with your ability to properly
pronounce "Szymankowicz."

10:44.716 --> 10:46.584
Did I?

10:46.586 --> 10:50.088
I'm kidding. It's, uh...
wow, that's really good work.

10:50.090 --> 10:51.425
Thank you.

10:52.826 --> 10:55.158
<i>...of the stars in our galaxy.</i>

10:55.160 --> 10:58.296
<i>We can see that our
galaxy contains more mass</i>

10:58.298 --> 11:01.531
<i>than is accounted for
by our stars and gasses.</i>

11:01.533 --> 11:05.670
<i>So what is this mysterious
invisible mass...</i>

11:05.672 --> 11:10.440
Hey, man.

11:10.442 --> 11:12.310
<i>Hey, buddy.
You busy?</i>

11:12.312 --> 11:14.212
I am, a little bit, yeah.

11:14.214 --> 11:16.347
We are, uh, sort of
up to our ears

11:16.349 --> 11:20.618
in this, uh, business acquisition thing.
What's going on?

11:20.620 --> 11:22.552
<i>Well, you know, I'm just calling
'cause I was just making sure</i>

11:22.554 --> 11:24.287
<i>we're still on
tonight for beers!</i>

11:24.289 --> 11:26.590
Ah, you know what?
I'm gonna have to

11:26.592 --> 11:28.158
pull the ripcord
on that thing, buddy.

11:28.160 --> 11:29.794
Um, I got a lot of work to do.

11:29.796 --> 11:31.496
Julia and I are getting started
early tomorrow.

11:31.498 --> 11:33.131
<i>Wait, "Julia and I"?</i>

11:33.133 --> 11:36.367
<i>Whoa. This girl is cute,
isn't she?</i>

11:36.369 --> 11:38.368
<i>Muy caliente.</i>

11:38.370 --> 11:40.740
All right, buddy.
You have a good night.

11:42.841 --> 11:45.376
<i>Dark matter exists
in two forms:</i>

11:45.378 --> 11:48.212
<i>ordinary matter
and exotic matter.</i>

11:48.214 --> 11:49.747
<i>The ordinary matter
is referred to</i>

11:49.749 --> 11:52.416
<i>by its acronym,
MACHOS,</i>

11:52.418 --> 11:54.754
<i>for Massive Compact
Halo Objects..</i>

12:28.620 --> 12:30.754
Hey, uh, change of plans.

12:30.756 --> 12:34.358
I'm gonna need these clients
done a little bit sooner.

12:34.360 --> 12:35.959
Okay, yeah, no,
how much sooner?

12:35.961 --> 12:37.594
End of the week.

12:37.596 --> 12:39.863
SEC quarterly review
got moved up a little bit.

12:39.865 --> 12:41.265
I need to have
these things done

12:41.267 --> 12:42.599
before they show up.

12:43.602 --> 12:45.469
Just get it done.

12:45.471 --> 12:46.871
Work overtime
if you have to,

12:46.873 --> 12:48.839
but I need it by Friday.

12:48.841 --> 12:51.776
Looks like it's going to
be another long night.

12:51.778 --> 12:53.547
Yeah, what else is new?

12:56.481 --> 12:58.449
You hungry?

12:58.451 --> 12:59.449
Ooh.

12:59.451 --> 13:00.520
Sound good?

13:02.254 --> 13:03.720
Excellent idea.

13:03.722 --> 13:04.921
You know, there's this
really cool thing,

13:04.923 --> 13:06.556
you can turn
those into a plate.

13:06.558 --> 13:08.358
But if you're gonna just
slurp it out of the box,

13:08.360 --> 13:10.861
let me at least
grab you a fork.

13:10.863 --> 13:13.330
Fork? You don't eat
Chinese with a fork,

13:13.332 --> 13:14.598
you use chopsticks.

13:14.600 --> 13:15.699
Why would I
use chopsticks?

13:15.701 --> 13:17.334
It's an
inferior utensil.

13:17.336 --> 13:18.669
I have a far superior one
here in the kitchen.

13:18.671 --> 13:20.238
Because that's
just the way it is.

13:20.240 --> 13:21.605
Says who?

13:21.607 --> 13:22.940
That'd be like
a caveman using

13:22.942 --> 13:24.507
sticks and stones
to start a fire

13:24.509 --> 13:26.243
when he's got a
lighter in his pocket.

13:26.245 --> 13:27.945
Oh, come on. Where's your
spirit of tradition?

13:27.947 --> 13:30.281
I think tradition is for
those who live in the past.

13:30.283 --> 13:33.783
Oh, is it? Those who don't study
history are doomed to repeat it.

13:33.785 --> 13:35.486
Yeah, but they wouldn't
know it, right,

13:35.488 --> 13:37.021
because they hadn't
studied it to begin with,

13:37.023 --> 13:40.458
so to them it's a brand-new
and exciting future.

13:40.460 --> 13:43.426
Oh, you do have an answer
for everything, don't you?

13:43.428 --> 13:44.661
You say it like
it's a bad thing.

13:44.663 --> 13:47.031
No one likes
a Johnny Know-it-All.

13:47.033 --> 13:50.667
Besides, you're not as smart
as you think you are.

13:50.669 --> 13:54.305
Ouch, that hurts me.

13:54.307 --> 13:55.873
Just calling it
like I see it.

13:55.875 --> 13:57.608
If you were really smart,

13:57.610 --> 13:59.977
you'd be doing something
more with your life.

13:59.979 --> 14:03.714
I don't know, I mean I...
poor kid from the Midwest,

14:03.716 --> 14:06.349
grew up in poverty
and now here I am,

14:06.351 --> 14:08.886
a successful account manager
making high six figures a year.

14:08.888 --> 14:11.289
I'd say that's something.

14:11.291 --> 14:15.825
Perhaps, if money alone is how
success is defined, but it's not.

14:15.827 --> 14:17.728
At least not in my world,
it's not.

14:17.730 --> 14:19.530
Well, how do you
define success?

14:19.532 --> 14:22.400
By the kind of impact
you make on the world.

14:22.402 --> 14:24.768
Yeah, I help people plan for retirement.
That's impactful.

14:24.770 --> 14:26.804
You help rich people
get richer.

14:26.806 --> 14:29.073
It's like teaching fish
how to swim.

14:29.075 --> 14:30.807
It's pretty low impact,

14:30.809 --> 14:34.847
especially when you are capable
of so much more.

14:37.850 --> 14:41.551
Okay, what do you mean?

14:41.553 --> 14:44.387
You are incredibly
intelligent,

14:44.389 --> 14:45.955
but I have seen
your type before.

14:45.957 --> 14:47.824
You're smarter
than everybody else,

14:47.826 --> 14:50.393
so you get by
with minimal effort.

14:50.395 --> 14:54.665
But you will never reach your
full potential living like that.

14:54.667 --> 14:58.035
I mean, you could really have
a real impact on society.

14:58.037 --> 15:01.372
You could be a doctor
curing disease,

15:01.374 --> 15:03.973
or a scientist inventing
new technology or...

15:03.975 --> 15:06.643
An astronaut.

15:06.645 --> 15:07.847
What?

15:11.583 --> 15:13.416
I always wanted to be an
astronaut when I was a kid,

15:13.418 --> 15:16.487
so I thought I would...

15:16.489 --> 15:19.089
grow up to be...

15:19.091 --> 15:20.491
an astronaut.

15:20.493 --> 15:21.992
I never told
anyone that before.

15:21.994 --> 15:24.163
So why didn't you?

15:28.033 --> 15:29.669
Because I...

15:33.972 --> 15:35.408
I don't know.

15:36.642 --> 15:39.743
I don't know.

15:39.745 --> 15:42.682
You know, it's not too late
to do something great.

15:44.716 --> 15:47.987
Don't be afraid to listen to what
the universe is telling you.

15:58.498 --> 16:00.765
All right, you are not
gonna believe this,

16:00.767 --> 16:03.401
but we are done.

16:03.403 --> 16:05.802
- Really?
- With time to spare. Yup.

16:05.804 --> 16:08.738
Wow.
Your boss will be excited.

16:08.740 --> 16:10.440
Maybe he'll give you a bonus.

16:10.442 --> 16:12.041
No, he's gonna call it
the price of admission

16:12.043 --> 16:13.844
and tell me that I'm lucky
to be working here.

16:13.846 --> 16:15.112
Ah, but that guy loves you
in a way

16:15.114 --> 16:16.814
he's not
ready to deal with.

16:16.816 --> 16:18.681
That just sounds creepy.

16:18.683 --> 16:20.950
You're saying gay people
creep you out?

16:20.952 --> 16:23.954
No, of course not.
Why would I say that?

16:23.956 --> 16:26.055
Wait, are you saying
that you think Ben is gay?

16:26.057 --> 16:28.892
No, just trying to make
you uncomfortable for a second.

16:28.894 --> 16:31.060
All right.

16:31.062 --> 16:33.129
- You are evil.
- Devilishly.

16:33.131 --> 16:35.598
All right, come on, I'll buy you
an ice cream to celebrate.

16:35.600 --> 16:37.801
Oh, okay.

16:37.803 --> 16:39.436
- Do you eat ice cream?
- Yeah.

16:39.438 --> 16:41.104
- All right, come on.
- Can I have this?

16:41.106 --> 16:43.107
Uh, no,
it's not your fault.

16:43.109 --> 16:44.775
You didn't know.
How could you have?

16:44.777 --> 16:46.009
No way of knowing.

16:46.011 --> 16:48.546
You a cone eater?

16:48.548 --> 16:51.815
- I'm not. Yeah, I'll get rid of those.
- I'm good.

16:51.817 --> 16:53.483
To tell you the truth,
the worst part about it

16:53.485 --> 16:56.119
was, uh,
the money, you know?

16:56.121 --> 16:57.220
I mean, they're
in a better place now

16:57.222 --> 16:58.988
and they're happy, but..

16:58.990 --> 17:01.595
What, you mean
the funeral expenses?

17:02.794 --> 17:04.929
No. No, no,
they're not dead.

17:04.931 --> 17:07.730
I bought them tickets
on the "Ocean World" liner.

17:07.732 --> 17:08.932
They're probably
more alive than I am.

17:08.934 --> 17:10.934
That is not funny.

17:10.935 --> 17:13.173
Well, you're not the only one
who enjoys a little sarcasm.

17:15.473 --> 17:16.906
So what's
next for you?

17:16.909 --> 17:17.941
What are you
planning on doing?

17:17.943 --> 17:20.109
What's your next move?

17:20.112 --> 17:24.848
Well, I want to
give back, you know?

17:24.851 --> 17:28.051
I mean, between the
buyout and my inheritance,

17:28.054 --> 17:30.220
- I am set for life.
- Really?

17:30.222 --> 17:32.690
And so that means
I can do what I want

17:32.692 --> 17:35.926
when I want and I want
that "what" to matter.

17:35.928 --> 17:38.796
Yeah, that makes sense.
I mean...

17:38.798 --> 17:40.197
I mean, exactly what
are you planning on doing?

17:40.199 --> 17:41.731
Like, how are you going
to change the world?

17:41.733 --> 17:43.801
You know, you strike me
as that kind of person

17:43.803 --> 17:45.035
who wants
to change the world.

17:45.037 --> 17:46.670
You gonna save
the whales, or what?

17:46.672 --> 17:49.206
Well, I guess I'm not
so much of a whale girl

17:49.208 --> 17:51.808
as I am a humanitarian.

17:51.810 --> 17:56.046
I don't know..
you watch the news and

17:56.048 --> 17:58.047
you see these
horrible things

17:58.049 --> 18:00.950
and just..
it makes you think.

18:00.952 --> 18:03.722
We've really got it
good here in the USA.

18:05.156 --> 18:08.859
They don't even show
you the worst stuff.

18:08.861 --> 18:10.764
Yeah, no,
you're probably right.

18:12.131 --> 18:13.967
So, what, you want
to expose the truth?

18:15.902 --> 18:19.603
I want to help those who
can't help themselves.

18:19.605 --> 18:24.874
I don't know, maybe teach
kids or build libraries,

18:24.876 --> 18:27.146
dig water wells.

18:28.914 --> 18:30.680
I don't know.

18:30.682 --> 18:32.082
It's like you said,

18:32.084 --> 18:34.051
there's a lot of
problems in the world.

18:34.053 --> 18:36.056
One girl can't fix them all.

18:39.325 --> 18:41.025
I don't know about that.

18:41.027 --> 18:43.160
I know I believe in you.

18:43.162 --> 18:45.161
I do.

18:45.163 --> 18:48.067
I do, and, um...

18:49.935 --> 18:51.869
...you've inspired me.

18:51.871 --> 18:54.270
You have. Um...

18:54.272 --> 18:56.942
maybe it's time for me
to do something great.

18:59.945 --> 19:01.210
You should have
become an astronaut,

19:01.212 --> 19:04.817
see how big
this world really is.

19:06.786 --> 19:09.719
You know, there are
over 300 billion stars

19:09.721 --> 19:11.721
in the Milky Way,

19:11.723 --> 19:14.959
and all we can do is
sit here and observe.

19:14.961 --> 19:16.759
You know, if you keep
looking at the world

19:16.761 --> 19:18.128
through a filter,

19:18.130 --> 19:20.567
you're never going
to see its true beauty.

19:22.734 --> 19:25.905
If you want to be
an astronaut, do it.

19:27.940 --> 19:31.240
Sometimes life
gives you moments,

19:31.242 --> 19:33.744
and if you don't leap
at the opportunity,

19:33.746 --> 19:36.615
you lose them forever.

19:50.363 --> 19:53.263
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

19:53.265 --> 19:56.269
Have to g...
Julia. Julia!

19:57.903 --> 19:59.969
<i>So she just left?
After ice cream?</i>

19:59.971 --> 20:03.806
Hmm... ice cream,
philosophy, romance.

20:03.808 --> 20:06.876
Well, you gave her the deadly
combo, boom, boom, boom!

20:06.878 --> 20:09.912
Yeah, it's
probably for the best.

20:09.914 --> 20:11.949
What do you mean?

20:11.951 --> 20:13.717
Why do you even care, bro?
Look at you.

20:13.719 --> 20:15.084
You're a tall,
good-looking dude.

20:15.086 --> 20:16.286
You could probably have
any girl in this bar.

20:16.288 --> 20:17.787
Here's one, for example.

20:17.789 --> 20:19.256
Just pick one out,
dust yourself off,

20:19.258 --> 20:20.690
and move on to the next one.

20:20.692 --> 20:21.758
I don't want
the next one,

20:21.760 --> 20:23.026
you understand?
I want this one.

20:23.028 --> 20:24.827
No, you only think
you want this one.

20:24.829 --> 20:26.896
It's called Psychology 101,
my friend.

20:26.898 --> 20:28.998
You two were forced
to spend an inordinate

20:29.000 --> 20:30.867
amount of time together
in such a brief period.

20:30.869 --> 20:32.302
Of course it's
gonna be natural

20:32.304 --> 20:34.103
for a certain level
of attraction to develop.

20:34.105 --> 20:37.306
But after time, this is all
gonna just pass away, pshhh.

20:37.308 --> 20:39.075
Okay, Freud, no, seriously,
I'm telling you,

20:39.077 --> 20:40.110
I know what
I'm talking about, okay?

20:40.112 --> 20:42.345
The energy was different.

20:42.347 --> 20:45.783
It's hard to explain.
It's just different.

20:45.785 --> 20:47.684
Okay, you've convinced me.

20:47.686 --> 20:49.253
Wait, what?
Really?

20:49.255 --> 20:51.321
No, but I can see
that you've convinced yourself

20:51.323 --> 20:53.157
so I'm just trying
to be supportive.

20:53.159 --> 20:55.758
Okay, so what do I do now?

20:55.760 --> 20:57.928
I think you should take
another crack at her.

20:57.930 --> 21:00.463
I mean, who knows, maybe
she's sitting in some bar

21:00.465 --> 21:01.899
on the other side
of town right now

21:01.901 --> 21:03.333
having this exact same
conversation

21:03.335 --> 21:05.268
with her best friend
named Kallie.

21:05.270 --> 21:07.004
That's right.

21:07.006 --> 21:08.439
Wait, she's got a best
friend named Kallie?

21:08.441 --> 21:09.405
Well, I like
to think that everyone

21:09.407 --> 21:10.440
has a best friend named Kal,

21:10.442 --> 21:11.709
or Kallie if it's a girl,

21:11.711 --> 21:13.009
although if she's a tomboy,

21:13.011 --> 21:14.279
they'll call her "Kal"
for short.

21:24.856 --> 21:27.056
What's this?

21:27.058 --> 21:29.125
It's a peace offering.

21:29.127 --> 21:31.397
So you can always see
the entirety of the world.

21:33.132 --> 21:35.199
It's stupid.

21:35.201 --> 21:37.767
No, it's great.
Thank you.

21:37.769 --> 21:39.469
Look, Eric, I need
to apologize...

21:39.471 --> 21:41.305
It's my fault. Listen, I got
caught up in the moment,

21:41.307 --> 21:42.972
and I did something
I shouldn't have done.

21:42.974 --> 21:44.941
It just felt... right.

21:44.943 --> 21:47.944
No, listen,
I need to apologize because

21:47.946 --> 21:50.948
I should have told you
that I had a boyfriend,

21:50.950 --> 21:53.283
a fiancé, actually.

21:53.285 --> 21:56.487
Oh. Yeah, maybe
you should have mentioned that.

21:56.489 --> 21:59.757
You don't, uh...
you don't wear a ring.

21:59.759 --> 22:02.258
Yeah, it's being sized.

22:02.260 --> 22:06.497
Um, okay...
a fiancé since when?

22:06.499 --> 22:09.932
2008. Well, not
engaged since then,

22:09.934 --> 22:11.834
but that's when we met.

22:11.836 --> 22:13.370
Our first date
was actually

22:13.372 --> 22:15.075
the opening night
of "Twilight".

22:17.777 --> 22:19.176
And you're still with him?

22:21.146 --> 22:23.881
I was actually sitting
on a park bench outside

22:23.883 --> 22:27.918
the South Hills Mall
and this guy comes up to me

22:27.920 --> 22:30.386
and he's like,
"Hey, I have this ticket

22:30.388 --> 22:32.890
to the 7:05 showing
because I was going to take

22:32.892 --> 22:35.025
my little sister
and she got sick.

22:35.027 --> 22:37.427
Any chance you'd
want to go with me?"

22:37.429 --> 22:41.398
Look, Eric, I don't
want to bore you with

22:41.400 --> 22:43.033
all these
"you're a great guy,"

22:43.035 --> 22:45.835
"you're going to find
the right girl" clichés.

22:45.837 --> 22:48.340
But you really
are a great guy.

22:51.911 --> 22:53.413
That's great.

23:02.887 --> 23:05.021
I'm telling you, man,
it was a total disaster, okay?

23:05.023 --> 23:06.989
I didn't even get
a word out and, boom,

23:06.991 --> 23:08.892
she drops
that bomb on me.

23:08.894 --> 23:10.427
What do I do?

23:10.429 --> 23:12.395
Listen to the advice
I already gave you.

23:12.397 --> 23:15.199
You gotta forget about her,
just let her be.

23:15.201 --> 23:16.600
Impossible.

23:16.602 --> 23:19.436
Wow, this girl's really
gotten to you, huh?

23:19.438 --> 23:21.872
You know what?
The way I see it,

23:21.874 --> 23:23.239
you only have two
options, okay?

23:23.241 --> 23:25.508
One, you win her
the old fashioned way

23:25.510 --> 23:27.110
with your words, or...

23:27.112 --> 23:29.412
- I let her be.
- ...you kill her boyfriend.

23:29.414 --> 23:30.847
Kal, you crazy?

23:30.849 --> 23:32.949
No.

23:32.951 --> 23:34.551
I'm not gonna kill
her boyfriend, Kal.

23:34.553 --> 23:37.019
- You want me to?
- No!

23:37.021 --> 23:39.222
Well, then...
you gotta go talk to her.

23:39.224 --> 23:41.123
I don't know what
to say to her. I tried.

23:41.125 --> 23:42.491
Jesus Christ, do I
have to do everything for you?

23:42.493 --> 23:43.492
This whole thing's
got me fucked up.

23:43.494 --> 23:44.894
Look at me right now.

23:44.896 --> 23:46.563
Does this look
like a happy face?

23:46.565 --> 23:48.565
Okay, look, if you are as
convinced as you say you are,

23:48.567 --> 23:50.867
then you gotta communicate
that to her, man.

23:50.869 --> 23:52.969
Say something honest,
from the heart.

23:52.971 --> 23:54.403
You gotta lay it
all out there

23:54.405 --> 23:56.573
and let the chips fall
where they may.

23:56.575 --> 23:58.441
Just make sure
you stop short of

23:58.443 --> 24:01.380
going all Affleck
in "Chasing Amy" on her.

24:03.015 --> 24:04.547
Affleck got the girl.

24:04.549 --> 24:06.883
Touché.

24:06.885 --> 24:09.989
Okay... okay.

24:49.127 --> 24:50.128
Julia.

24:51.195 --> 24:53.697
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:53.699 --> 24:55.998
Do you have a minute, maybe,
to go over something?

24:56.000 --> 24:57.604
Yeah, yeah, what's up?

25:00.940 --> 25:03.042
I don't know
how to put this, um...

25:04.276 --> 25:06.109
Life is complicated, right?

25:06.111 --> 25:09.947
It's full of surprises,
things you didn't see coming.

25:09.949 --> 25:12.949
and, um,
you gotta make choices,

25:12.951 --> 25:14.183
and there are
moments, right,

25:14.185 --> 25:15.922
that are...
that are important.

25:18.490 --> 25:19.989
Eric, what are
you trying to say?

25:19.991 --> 25:22.028
Just bear with me, uh...

25:27.031 --> 25:29.032
I'm falling
in love with you,

25:29.034 --> 25:33.569
and I...
just hear me out.

25:33.571 --> 25:36.206
There are over seven
billion people on this planet,

25:36.208 --> 25:39.209
yet somehow, some way,
our paths managed to cross,

25:39.211 --> 25:42.712
right,
in the most unlikely event.

25:42.714 --> 25:45.649
And I feel amazing
when I'm around you.

25:45.651 --> 25:48.584
I feel like
I'm full of life, and happy,

25:48.586 --> 25:54.557
like I have purpose,
and, um...

25:54.559 --> 25:57.427
I'm sort of hoping
that you felt the same way.

25:57.429 --> 26:00.596
If not, just a little bit
of you, and I feel like,

26:00.598 --> 26:03.065
if you do,
that we owe it to ourselves

26:03.067 --> 26:07.671
to explore that feeling
a little bit deeper.

26:07.673 --> 26:09.538
I know it sounds crazy

26:09.540 --> 26:13.043
but I'm sitting over there
and I'm waiting for you...

26:13.045 --> 26:16.380
and I can't help
but think that, uh...

26:16.382 --> 26:18.451
you and I were
meant to be together.

26:19.684 --> 26:22.018
No, we weren't.

26:22.020 --> 26:23.652
If the universe,
as you say,

26:23.654 --> 26:26.288
had truly wanted us
to be together,

26:26.290 --> 26:28.557
we would be together.

26:28.559 --> 26:31.128
We would have met
at a different time,

26:31.130 --> 26:32.763
but we didn't.

26:32.765 --> 26:35.301
I love my fiancé.

26:38.237 --> 26:39.369
Hey, babe.

26:39.371 --> 26:41.103
Adam, hi, honey.

26:41.105 --> 26:43.340
This is Eric.
He was just in the area,

26:43.342 --> 26:44.708
- thought he'd say hi.
- Yeah.

26:44.710 --> 26:47.177
Yeah, no, Eric.
Jules told me a lot about you.

26:47.179 --> 26:48.311
It's nice to
finally meet you.

26:48.313 --> 26:49.779
Oh, good.
All right, great.

26:49.781 --> 26:52.181
Just the... just said
the good stuff about you.

26:52.183 --> 26:54.651
Oh, well.

26:54.653 --> 26:56.219
You guys don't have
to stand out here.

26:56.221 --> 26:58.087
Why don't you come
inside and grab a drink?

26:58.089 --> 27:01.091
Uh, you know what? I would,
but I probably shouldn't.

27:01.093 --> 27:03.325
I came by for a work thing and then
I gotta get back to the grind.

27:03.327 --> 27:05.562
- You know how it is.
- Yeah, I know.

27:05.564 --> 27:07.096
Hey, nice to finally
meet you, bro.

27:07.098 --> 27:08.565
Oh, you too. Thanks.

27:08.567 --> 27:09.799
Goodbye, Eric.

27:09.801 --> 27:12.038
- Enjoy your day.
- Take care, bro.

27:19.744 --> 27:23.380
<i>If we were able to move an
object faster than the speed of light,</i>

27:23.382 --> 27:25.582
<i>according to Einstein's
Theory of Relativity,</i>

27:25.584 --> 27:28.485
<i>there would be an inertial
frame of reference</i>

27:28.487 --> 27:30.420
<i>in which
the object or the signal</i>

27:30.422 --> 27:34.257
<i>would be moving
backward in time.</i>

27:34.259 --> 27:36.596
<i>Is time travel possible?</i>

27:38.497 --> 27:40.497
<i>Or is time travel
simply a concept</i>

27:40.499 --> 27:43.632
<i>that exists only
in science fiction?</i>

27:43.634 --> 27:46.236
<i>Imagine reliving
the moon landing,</i>

27:46.238 --> 27:49.840
<i>or watching Babe Ruth
hit a home run in person.</i>

27:49.842 --> 27:52.843
<i>And while time travel
is often thought of</i>

27:52.845 --> 27:56.379
<i>as a science fiction trope,
it is in fact something</i>

27:56.381 --> 27:59.548
<i>that may someday soon
become a reality.</i>

27:59.550 --> 28:03.420
<i>You see, the Theory
of General Relativity</i>

28:03.422 --> 28:07.157
<i>suggests a basis
for backward time travel,</i>

28:07.159 --> 28:10.494
<i>and I not only believe
that time travel is</i>

28:10.496 --> 28:13.697
<i>theoretically possible,
but I am confident</i>

28:13.699 --> 28:16.169
<i>that it will be achieved
during my lifetime.</i>

28:38.690 --> 28:40.724
Like, after 4:00 pm all the...

28:40.726 --> 28:43.160
you guys got your ID?

28:43.162 --> 28:45.194
It's insane, you know?

28:45.196 --> 28:46.896
Like, what are we
supposed to do? ID?

28:46.898 --> 28:48.731
Uh, I'm actually
not a student.

28:48.733 --> 28:51.735
I was hoping to speak
to Dr. Joseph Goyer?

28:51.737 --> 28:54.638
Ah. Authorized personnel only
beyond this point, sir.

28:54.640 --> 28:56.206
Right, no, I understand.

28:56.208 --> 28:58.741
I was just hoping to get
a quick word with him.

28:58.743 --> 29:00.242
Maybe you could bring
him up to the front

29:00.244 --> 29:02.312
or I could schedule
an appointment,

29:02.314 --> 29:04.480
maybe speak to him later.
Whatever works.

29:04.482 --> 29:07.486
Are you deaf,
or are you stupid?

29:09.755 --> 29:11.755
I'm sorry, what?

29:11.757 --> 29:14.824
Ah, deaf, I see.

29:14.826 --> 29:19.196
Authorized personnel only

29:19.198 --> 29:22.435
beyond this point, sir.

29:23.835 --> 29:25.701
Are you for real?
Because I was just asking

29:25.703 --> 29:27.603
- for a little bit of help.
- Yeah, okay,

29:27.605 --> 29:28.971
Keep pushing me, buddy,

29:28.973 --> 29:31.941
and you're about to see
just how real I can get.

29:31.943 --> 29:33.910
Everything okay here, Ed?

29:33.912 --> 29:36.880
Yes. Nothing I can't
handle, Professor.

29:36.882 --> 29:39.315
Uh, can I help you?

29:39.317 --> 29:42.451
Uh, perhaps.
I was hoping to get a word

29:42.453 --> 29:45.758
with Dr. Joseph Goyer
in the Physics Department.

29:49.361 --> 29:52.796
It's okay, Ed.
I'll handle this.

29:52.798 --> 29:54.797
Come on, follow me.

29:54.799 --> 29:56.932
Don't worry.

29:56.934 --> 29:59.302
Pardon me, Ed.

29:59.304 --> 30:00.636
Dr. Goyer was one of
the most brilliant scientists

30:00.638 --> 30:01.971
I ever worked with.

30:01.973 --> 30:04.306
"Was"? He doesn't
work here anymore?

30:04.308 --> 30:06.476
Not for about
five years now.

30:06.478 --> 30:08.378
What happened?

30:08.380 --> 30:09.845
Lab accident.

30:09.847 --> 30:12.882
He was working on
a device that he believed

30:12.884 --> 30:15.818
would generate enough
power to open two points

30:15.820 --> 30:17.821
in the space-time
continuum.

30:17.823 --> 30:19.623
Time travel.

30:19.625 --> 30:21.857
But his experiment
wasn't authorized.

30:21.859 --> 30:24.427
Something went wrong
and an explosion

30:24.429 --> 30:26.395
destroyed the physics lab.

30:26.397 --> 30:28.498
He died in
that explosion?

30:28.500 --> 30:31.767
No, no one was hurt
in the incident,

30:31.769 --> 30:35.438
but the university president
was none too pleased.

30:35.440 --> 30:36.976
Goyer was fired.

30:39.744 --> 30:42.612
After he got fired,
did you guys keep in touch?

30:42.614 --> 30:45.015
He reach out? You have any
idea where he might be?

30:45.017 --> 30:48.918
No, he pretty much dropped
off the radar after that.

30:48.920 --> 30:51.054
You might want
to try his ex-wife.

30:51.056 --> 30:54.423
I think she still
lives in the area.

30:54.425 --> 30:55.624
Well, Professor,
thank you so much

30:55.626 --> 30:56.825
for your time.
I appreciate it.

30:56.827 --> 30:58.027
Sorry I couldn't
be more help.

30:58.029 --> 30:59.699
You've been great,
thank you.

31:03.367 --> 31:04.369
Uh...

31:06.837 --> 31:09.873
Time travel.
You, uh...

31:09.875 --> 31:12.642
you don't suppose he was
on to something, do you?

31:12.644 --> 31:17.380
His theories contradicted many
modern physics principles,

31:17.382 --> 31:22.017
but Joe was smarter
than all of us, so...

31:22.019 --> 31:23.353
who knows?

31:23.355 --> 31:24.690
Thanks again.

31:28.759 --> 31:30.526
<i>So can I get you
something to drink?</i>

31:30.528 --> 31:32.594
Coffee? Water?

31:32.596 --> 31:35.634
Uh, sure, I'll have a water.
Sounds good.

31:38.436 --> 31:40.670
You know, like I told
you on the phone,

31:40.672 --> 31:43.409
I don't think I'm going
to be very much help to you.

31:46.877 --> 31:51.815
You know, it seems
like a lifetime ago.

31:51.817 --> 31:55.084
When was the last time
you, um, talked to him?

31:55.086 --> 31:58.054
Truth be told, I haven't
seen or heard from him

31:58.056 --> 31:59.988
in almost five years.

31:59.990 --> 32:04.393
And you don't have any idea
where he might be, or...?

32:04.395 --> 32:07.764
Well, he had a grandfather
on his mother's side

32:07.766 --> 32:09.899
who owns
some land out in Colorado

32:09.901 --> 32:13.769
or... maybe it
was Arizona.

32:13.771 --> 32:15.907
I can't remember,
but you could start there.

32:19.577 --> 32:22.010
So I Holden McNeil-ed her,

32:22.012 --> 32:24.546
she did not Alyssa Jones
me back.

32:24.548 --> 32:27.116
What?
Dude, that blows, man,

32:27.118 --> 32:28.852
and not in a good way.

32:28.854 --> 32:30.754
Oh, and I met her fiancé.

32:30.756 --> 32:32.855
Was he a Rick Derris type?

32:32.857 --> 32:36.092
No, no. He was charming, actually.
Nice guy.

32:36.094 --> 32:38.894
Invited me in for a drink.
I declined.

32:38.896 --> 32:41.430
Well, that's tough
to compete with.

32:41.432 --> 32:43.568
You can't
compete with it.

32:49.141 --> 32:52.808
Unless...

32:52.810 --> 32:56.513
what if there was a way
to travel back in time

32:56.515 --> 32:59.582
to a point before
she met this guy?

32:59.584 --> 33:01.785
Holy shit,
why didn't I think of that?

33:01.787 --> 33:03.987
The DeLorean's parked
right here, Marty.

33:03.989 --> 33:06.855
- What are we waiting for?
- I'm being serious, Kal.

33:06.857 --> 33:08.892
What if that
were possible?

33:08.894 --> 33:11.960
Well, I would say yeah,
that's a crazy plan.

33:11.962 --> 33:14.099
Why are you
chasing this woman?

33:16.567 --> 33:19.201
Hell, I never did
anything with my life.

33:19.203 --> 33:21.938
Nothing.
I'm floating by.

33:21.940 --> 33:23.539
I've never fought
for anything,

33:23.541 --> 33:24.908
was never inspired
to do anything,

33:24.910 --> 33:26.778
I never
worked for anything.

33:29.780 --> 33:32.582
What if this
is that moment?

33:32.584 --> 33:33.949
What if this is
that moment

33:33.951 --> 33:36.020
that I'm supposed
to fight for?

33:38.557 --> 33:40.893
I don't want to look back
and have any regrets.

33:44.829 --> 33:47.066
What are you
talking about?

33:52.170 --> 33:55.838
There's this guy, Joseph
Goyer, Dr. Joseph Goyer.

33:55.840 --> 33:57.707
He believes that time travel
is possible.

33:57.709 --> 33:58.874
I know it sounds
crazy but he thinks

33:58.876 --> 34:01.577
it can be achieved
in our lifetime.

34:01.579 --> 34:02.814
And you believe him?

34:04.883 --> 34:07.883
No... I don't know.

34:07.885 --> 34:09.885
I'd like a chance to get to
talk to the guy, you know?

34:09.887 --> 34:11.786
Okay, then, why don't you?

34:11.789 --> 34:13.822
'Cause I can't find him.

34:13.824 --> 34:16.726
I went to his old work, I talked
to his ex-coworkers, his ex-wife.

34:16.728 --> 34:18.126
Nobody knows where
the hell the guy is.

34:18.128 --> 34:22.164
Well, maybe... maybe he's dead.

34:22.166 --> 34:24.233
His ex-wife said
something about a ranch

34:24.235 --> 34:27.105
in Colorado or
Arizona or something.

34:29.574 --> 34:30.974
Hey...

34:30.976 --> 34:33.742
what did you say
this guy's name was again?

34:33.744 --> 34:35.480
Joseph Goyer.

34:37.282 --> 34:39.081
Like G-o-y-e-r?

34:39.083 --> 34:41.985
Yeah. What are you doing?

34:41.987 --> 34:44.686
Give me 24 hours to find
this doctor of yours.

34:44.688 --> 34:46.255
- All right.
- How are you gonna do that?

34:46.257 --> 34:48.257
Hey, I'm Kal.

34:48.260 --> 34:49.757
You got this, right?

34:49.760 --> 34:51.260
- Yeah, no, I got it.
- Thanks, buddy.

34:51.262 --> 34:52.527
All right.

35:02.873 --> 35:05.240
So whoever couldn't
find this doctor of yours

35:05.242 --> 35:06.809
wasn't looking very hard.

35:06.811 --> 35:08.077
What are you talking about?
You found him?

35:08.079 --> 35:09.077
Yeah, where's
the peanut butter?

35:09.079 --> 35:11.113
To the left, second shelf.

35:11.115 --> 35:13.682
- County records.
- What?

35:13.684 --> 35:15.684
Arizona county records,
to be exact.

35:15.686 --> 35:17.119
So, turns out his grandfather

35:17.121 --> 35:19.889
owned a large parcel of land
in rural Arizona,

35:19.891 --> 35:21.257
land which,
according to county records,

35:21.259 --> 35:24.961
has never changed hands,
you follow?

35:24.963 --> 35:27.130
So his grandfather
passed away in 1992,

35:27.132 --> 35:28.998
which means the land
probably stayed

35:29.000 --> 35:30.999
in the family
so they never had to file

35:31.001 --> 35:32.869
the paperwork to change
the name on the deed.

35:32.871 --> 35:35.271
Kal, how'd you find out
all this information, anyway?

35:35.273 --> 35:36.972
Internet,
what do you think?

35:36.974 --> 35:38.608
Oh, I did a quick
satellite search

35:38.610 --> 35:40.242
and I found this.
Check it out.

35:40.244 --> 35:41.711
What's this?

35:41.713 --> 35:42.979
So that's the house
right there,

35:42.981 --> 35:44.847
and then that looks like
a car or a truck.

35:44.849 --> 35:46.215
It's kind of hard to tell
'cause the resolution...

35:46.217 --> 35:48.016
I swear to God I would
give you a hug right now

35:48.018 --> 35:49.719
if I didn't think
you'd get hard from it.

35:49.721 --> 35:52.822
Well, I did one better:
driving directions.

35:52.824 --> 35:55.057
What?!
Look at you!

35:55.059 --> 35:57.827
You know what
this means, right?

35:57.829 --> 35:59.265
Yeah.

36:02.367 --> 36:03.569
Oh, yeah.

36:06.804 --> 36:08.338
I mean, you know,
this guy could wind up

36:08.340 --> 36:11.007
being some kind
of wack job, right?

36:11.009 --> 36:13.943
Eric Laziter, it's been
an honor and a privilege

36:13.945 --> 36:17.112
being your best friend
for the past 16 years.

36:17.114 --> 36:19.983
Godspeed, my friend.

36:19.985 --> 36:23.219
Kal, you're
an amazing human being.

36:23.221 --> 36:24.954
The honor and
the privilege was all mine.

36:24.956 --> 36:27.123
Get in here.
Come here, buddy.

36:27.125 --> 36:28.657
- Love you, man.
- I love you too.

36:28.659 --> 36:31.260
- Aah! Go get her, dog.
- All right. Thank you.

36:31.262 --> 36:33.362
Hey, can I have your TV?

37:25.449 --> 37:28.851
Dr. Goyer?
Joseph Goyer?

37:28.853 --> 37:31.389
Well, it's mainly
just "Joe" these days.

37:33.791 --> 37:36.726
I'm, uh, Eric Laziter.

37:36.728 --> 37:37.994
Nice to see you in person.

37:37.996 --> 37:39.929
I've come a long
way to talk to you.

37:39.931 --> 37:41.063
Curious.

37:41.065 --> 37:43.331
Well, what can I
do for you, son?

37:43.333 --> 37:45.901
Uh, truthfully
I'm curious about

37:45.903 --> 37:47.804
your theories
on time travel.

37:47.806 --> 37:49.237
You said it could be
achieved in our lifetime,

37:49.239 --> 37:51.740
said theoretically
it was possible.

37:51.742 --> 37:55.945
What do you think we'd
need to make it happen?

37:55.947 --> 37:59.718
A lot of money...
and time.

38:01.418 --> 38:02.818
Well, money I have,

38:02.820 --> 38:06.789
and if your
theories are true...

38:06.791 --> 38:08.791
time shouldn't be
an issue either, right?

38:08.793 --> 38:11.193
Well, technically...
you know what?

38:11.195 --> 38:12.964
Let's go inside and talk.

38:15.065 --> 38:17.200
Okay, the ball
represents the Earth.

38:17.202 --> 38:19.001
- Okay.
- The fabric

38:19.003 --> 38:22.871
represents that which is
MALLEABLE: space and time.

38:22.873 --> 38:24.941
This point where
the fabric and the ball

38:24.943 --> 38:27.809
are touching represents
where we currently are

38:27.811 --> 38:30.179
- in both time and space.
- Okay.

38:30.181 --> 38:32.882
Now, with enough energy
focused on space and time,

38:32.884 --> 38:34.950
you can
snap together in time

38:34.952 --> 38:38.019
two moments
just for an instant.

38:38.021 --> 38:40.856
Sounds a lot like
the Rosen bridge theory.

38:40.858 --> 38:43.892
It's essentially a wormhole
you're talking about, right?

38:43.894 --> 38:45.862
Precisely.

38:45.864 --> 38:48.798
Now, reports mentioned the
immeasurably small amount of time

38:48.800 --> 38:50.266
that the gap
in space-time was open.

38:50.268 --> 38:52.400
Right, suggesting
that not even

38:52.402 --> 38:53.436
an electron could
slip through.

38:53.438 --> 38:55.003
See, that was their flaw,

38:55.005 --> 38:57.340
and where my theory differs.

38:57.342 --> 38:59.441
The electrons could
travel the wormhole,

38:59.443 --> 39:03.345
but they arrive on a different
plane of existence.

39:03.347 --> 39:05.280
When space and time
are broken,

39:05.282 --> 39:08.918
you effectively create
a new alternate reality,

39:08.920 --> 39:13.523
one that follows our past
exactly until it's created,

39:13.525 --> 39:15.525
at which point
the unnatural interactions

39:15.527 --> 39:19.829
spiral off into
a future unrecognizable.

39:19.831 --> 39:21.329
A future unrecognizable,

39:21.331 --> 39:22.999
so you can change the past?

39:23.001 --> 39:26.269
No, no, no.
You can change your future.

39:26.271 --> 39:28.838
Or, rather,
the future in the time line

39:28.840 --> 39:31.009
that you traveled back to.

39:34.846 --> 39:37.112
You're saying
this is a one-way trip, right?

39:37.114 --> 39:38.981
I suppose inter-dimensional
travel

39:38.983 --> 39:42.050
is theoretically
possible at some point.

39:42.052 --> 39:43.418
The concepts and equations

39:43.420 --> 39:45.320
involving that matter
far, far exceed

39:45.322 --> 39:48.191
anything in the current
world known of physics.

39:48.193 --> 39:51.961
Why didn't you
continue your research?

39:51.963 --> 39:54.396
Yeah, um...

39:54.398 --> 39:57.867
blowing up a lab
gives people pause

39:57.869 --> 40:00.869
when it comes
to acquiring funding.

40:00.871 --> 40:04.039
The incident also caused
me to become

40:04.041 --> 40:07.445
a bit of a laughingstock within
the scientific community.

40:11.949 --> 40:12.951
Okay.

40:14.952 --> 40:16.054
One last question.

40:19.190 --> 40:21.260
How do you feel
about second chances?

40:22.994 --> 40:25.561
Look around.

40:25.563 --> 40:29.067
What do you see?
What do you hear?

40:33.103 --> 40:34.970
Nothing.

40:34.972 --> 40:40.610
Exactly.
It's just beautiful.

40:40.612 --> 40:44.012
All my life
I've been surrounded

40:44.014 --> 40:46.182
by the busyness
of the world,

40:46.184 --> 40:49.017
its problems, the critics.

40:49.019 --> 40:53.990
It can literally drain
the life out of you.

40:53.992 --> 40:57.626
But as I've grown older,

40:57.628 --> 40:59.461
I've grown to appreciate
the peace of mind

40:59.463 --> 41:01.500
that comes with the silence.

41:02.666 --> 41:05.601
I have no desire
to go back.

41:05.603 --> 41:08.905
None at all, huh?
Why is that?

41:08.907 --> 41:12.544
A man can only
handle so much failure.

41:16.914 --> 41:19.615
You know, some of
the brightest minds in history

41:19.617 --> 41:22.117
have had to endure
incredible amounts of failure

41:22.119 --> 41:23.318
in order
to achieve success.

41:23.320 --> 41:25.153
Take Robert Goddard,
for example.

41:25.155 --> 41:27.423
- Apples and oranges.
- It's not apples and oranges.

41:27.425 --> 41:29.958
His theories on rockets
we could potentially use

41:29.960 --> 41:31.459
for space travel,
they were highly criticized.

41:31.461 --> 41:34.063
He was called a fool,
told they were impossible.

41:34.065 --> 41:36.132
He was shunned.

41:36.134 --> 41:39.302
Eight years later,

41:39.304 --> 41:41.704
his research was key in the
genesis of the space program.

41:41.706 --> 41:43.972
- Your point?
- My point, doctor,

41:43.974 --> 41:47.275
is that he let people drive him
into seclusion, the critics,

41:47.277 --> 41:50.146
and he died before
he was ever able

41:50.148 --> 41:51.546
to see his vision
become reality.

41:51.548 --> 41:53.085
My point to you...

41:55.686 --> 41:58.222
...is maybe it's time
for you to get back to work.

42:00.458 --> 42:02.090
<i>What's this?</i>

42:02.092 --> 42:06.061
A monument
to wasted time and money.

42:06.063 --> 42:08.463
Want to know how it works?

42:08.465 --> 42:09.934
In theory...

42:14.137 --> 42:17.072
Sorry.

42:17.074 --> 42:18.541
The process
of condensing energy

42:18.543 --> 42:21.978
can be obtained with
super-conducted dark matter.

42:21.980 --> 42:25.046
Dark matter makes up
approximately 25%

42:25.048 --> 42:26.983
of the total mass
of the universe,

42:26.985 --> 42:28.450
and while it is
not detectable

42:28.452 --> 42:30.720
via traditional means,

42:30.722 --> 42:33.021
I have devised a way
to collect and store

42:33.023 --> 42:35.557
limited quantities of it.

42:35.559 --> 42:38.126
You can store
dark matter, how?

42:38.128 --> 42:40.729
By using rods made of
a special Osmium alloy,

42:40.731 --> 42:43.432
oppositely charged to
create a unique magnetic field

42:43.434 --> 42:46.334
which attracts and
stores the dark matter.

42:46.336 --> 42:47.769
The charges are
then reversed,

42:47.771 --> 42:50.072
causing the dark matter
to be discharged

42:50.074 --> 42:51.706
as a form of dark energy

42:51.708 --> 42:53.608
with enough
power to collapse two points

42:53.610 --> 42:55.713
in the space-time continuum.

42:59.016 --> 43:01.419
Okay. All right,
where do we start?

43:03.554 --> 43:07.125
Uh, we start
by cleaning the lab.

43:08.458 --> 43:10.492
The lab doesn't
get used much, huh?

43:10.494 --> 43:13.965
It's used plenty...
for storage.

43:18.635 --> 43:21.105
Uh, and this?

43:22.440 --> 43:24.572
- How big are the holes?
- What, are you serious?

43:24.574 --> 43:26.708
I mean, I can buy you another pair
of socks if that's what you need.

43:26.710 --> 43:29.211
Throw it in "tools".

43:29.213 --> 43:32.313
Tools... see, I've been
using these things all wrong.

43:32.315 --> 43:35.818
You're looking at it wrong.
It's a rag now.

43:35.820 --> 43:37.552
That's clever.

43:37.554 --> 43:40.356
So, what are you doing
with your time these days

43:40.358 --> 43:42.358
now that you're done
studying time travel?

43:42.360 --> 43:44.827
I spend most of my time
working on that old truck.

43:44.829 --> 43:47.595
It was my dad's.

43:47.597 --> 43:49.731
Been fixing it up
for a long time now.

43:49.733 --> 43:53.401
More of a tinkerer, really,
than a scientist these days,

43:53.403 --> 43:56.505
though I've never really
given up, I suppose.

43:56.507 --> 43:59.108
I'm working the problem
on a smaller scale.

43:59.110 --> 44:01.480
So there are scales
to time travel?

44:02.813 --> 44:05.514
Powering the machine
is only half the battle.

44:05.516 --> 44:07.516
I'm working on the equations.

44:07.518 --> 44:10.188
I see. Well...

44:11.521 --> 44:12.854
call me a simpleton,

44:12.856 --> 44:16.425
but these equations
look pretty solid to me.

44:16.427 --> 44:17.760
Simpleton.

44:17.762 --> 44:20.595
The variables
are undefined.

44:20.597 --> 44:24.200
I spend most of my time chipping
away at the possibilities.

44:24.202 --> 44:27.305
I have no solutions
as of yet.

44:29.306 --> 44:31.307
You identify
the impossibilities,

44:31.309 --> 44:34.510
all you're left with
are the possible.

44:34.512 --> 44:38.414
Yeah, I suppose.

44:38.416 --> 44:40.282
I mean,
isn't that the end game?

44:40.284 --> 44:41.787
To solve the equation?

44:51.262 --> 44:55.363
When I was a kid,
there was this toy,

44:55.365 --> 45:01.804
um... a decoder or
a kaleidoscope or something.

45:01.806 --> 45:04.472
It was
the holy grail to me.

45:04.474 --> 45:08.144
It cost five dollars.

45:08.146 --> 45:10.778
So I scrimped and saved

45:10.780 --> 45:12.481
and added cents
here and there

45:12.483 --> 45:15.251
and eventually I had it,
five dollars.

45:15.253 --> 45:17.253
I went down
and I bought the toy...

45:17.255 --> 45:20.822
only to have it stolen
by this neighborhood bully,

45:20.824 --> 45:22.593
Earl Schroeder.

45:24.561 --> 45:27.630
Anyway, I saved again,
and my birthday comes

45:27.632 --> 45:31.800
and all of a sudden,
five dollars in my palm.

45:31.802 --> 45:34.702
I get on my bike
and I pedal so fast

45:34.704 --> 45:36.271
to get to the store,
I upend my bike

45:36.273 --> 45:39.307
on the way to get
my perfect prize.

45:39.309 --> 45:41.744
And my birthday money
went for new handlebars.

45:41.746 --> 45:44.345
Not my choice.

45:44.347 --> 45:47.883
Back to square one.
I save the money,

45:47.885 --> 45:49.517
I get to the store,

45:49.519 --> 45:52.454
sold out, never to return.

45:52.456 --> 45:55.191
Really?
I'd say somebody

45:55.193 --> 45:56.758
didn't want you to have
that kaleidoscope.

45:56.760 --> 45:58.459
Ah, you would think.

45:58.461 --> 46:00.795
Years later I have a job.

46:00.797 --> 46:03.766
One week I get
a bonus in my check.

46:03.768 --> 46:05.633
I never forgot that toy.

46:05.635 --> 46:07.735
I find it at
a vintage toy store.

46:07.737 --> 46:09.204
I go down to the store.

46:09.206 --> 46:11.273
I slide the money
across the table,

46:11.275 --> 46:12.740
ear-to-ear grin.

46:12.742 --> 46:14.809
I collect my perfect prize.

46:14.811 --> 46:17.679
I walk outside, I'm looking
through the kaleidoscope.

46:17.681 --> 46:19.748
All right,
mission accomplished.

46:19.750 --> 46:21.416
Sort of.

46:21.418 --> 46:22.952
While I'm looking
through the kaleidoscope,

46:22.954 --> 46:24.954
not paying attention
to where I'm going,

46:24.956 --> 46:27.322
I run into this
beautiful young woman.

46:27.324 --> 46:29.791
She's carrying
home groceries from the store.

46:29.793 --> 46:31.594
Knock 'em all over the ground.

46:31.596 --> 46:33.963
In my haste to help her
collect her groceries,

46:33.965 --> 46:36.835
I step on and crush
the kaleidoscope.

46:38.936 --> 46:40.501
Kaleidoscope was jinxed.

46:40.503 --> 46:43.871
No, actually
quite the opposite.

46:43.873 --> 46:45.740
That beautiful young woman

46:45.742 --> 46:48.376
would go on
to become my wife.

46:48.378 --> 46:50.845
This lifelong quest
that I was on

46:50.847 --> 46:54.483
was actually about
something else altogether.

46:54.485 --> 46:58.019
See, I didn't know where
I was supposed to be

46:58.021 --> 47:00.224
until I'd
actually arrived.

47:04.295 --> 47:06.530
Earth to Eric.

47:13.871 --> 47:18.474
Yeah, I was just
thinking about your story

47:18.476 --> 47:22.945
and if
your theory's right...

47:22.947 --> 47:25.914
I was just thinking maybe
your journey's not complete.

47:25.916 --> 47:27.449
What is all this, anyway?

47:27.451 --> 47:29.717
Most of them are
sophisticated gauges

47:29.719 --> 47:31.686
and instruments that will
allow me to pinpoint

47:31.688 --> 47:34.856
exactly when and where
a time traveler ends up.

47:34.858 --> 47:37.358
The process requires
exact calculations

47:37.360 --> 47:38.994
to determine
not only the time,

47:38.996 --> 47:42.898
- but the place as well.
- Okay.

47:42.900 --> 47:45.367
The earth is
in constant motion,

47:45.369 --> 47:47.436
both rotationally
and orbitally,

47:47.438 --> 47:49.003
so sending
a time traveler back

47:49.005 --> 47:51.572
to a specific point in space

47:51.574 --> 47:54.876
could very well occur at a time
when the earth isn't there.

47:54.878 --> 47:58.813
And I must also account
for not only

47:58.815 --> 48:00.883
the rotation of the earth
but also the rate or speed

48:00.885 --> 48:02.717
at which the galaxy
is expanding.

48:02.719 --> 48:04.987
Without precise
and exact calculations,

48:04.989 --> 48:06.822
a traveler could end up
being dropped off

48:06.824 --> 48:10.492
in the cold vacuum of space
and killed instantly.

48:10.494 --> 48:12.827
Push a couple of buttons,
turn a few knobs, right?

48:12.829 --> 48:14.929
Hey, you have no idea
the amount of education

48:14.931 --> 48:16.764
- it takes to fathom this kind of math!
- All right, relax.

48:16.766 --> 48:19.334
I understand what
an imaginary number is.

48:19.336 --> 48:22.905
- It's okay.
- Good.

48:22.907 --> 48:24.606
Why don't you
go get some rest?

48:24.608 --> 48:28.443
Tomorrow... tomorrow
we start the real work.

48:31.882 --> 48:33.351
<i>Look, I'm no psychiatrist...</i>

48:35.119 --> 48:38.356
but I can tell there's something
more going on with you.

48:43.693 --> 48:47.532
Ah... am I allowed
to cite personal reasons?

48:50.934 --> 48:55.037
All right,
suffice it to say that, um,

48:55.039 --> 48:58.106
maybe I wasn't happy
where my journey ended up

48:58.108 --> 49:01.043
and I decided to take
things into my own hands.

49:01.045 --> 49:02.978
Surely you've had things
in your life that you regret,

49:02.980 --> 49:05.483
things you wish
you'd done differently.

49:07.885 --> 49:09.921
Only one
that really mattered.

49:11.956 --> 49:13.688
<i>I don't know, man.
I gotta tell ya...</i>

49:13.690 --> 49:15.891
I do not see you
getting past my shields.

49:15.893 --> 49:17.959
Pfft. Your shields
will break down.

49:17.961 --> 49:19.961
Star Fleet's pretty smart
in their work.

49:19.963 --> 49:22.030
Torpedoes with
16.1 isotone power,

49:22.032 --> 49:24.499
18 type 7
phase emitters.

49:24.501 --> 49:26.101
No, the USS "Enterprise"

49:26.103 --> 49:28.070
trumps the Imperial
Class Star Destroyer

49:28.072 --> 49:31.072
in any galaxy.

49:31.074 --> 49:33.108
Oh, and be careful
when you set that CPU.

49:33.110 --> 49:35.411
That has to be very
precisely placed.

49:35.413 --> 49:36.744
I got it.

49:36.746 --> 49:37.748
Okay.

49:40.818 --> 49:43.918
Lightsaber.
Pretty cool.

49:43.920 --> 49:47.956
Phaser.
Range beats melee.

49:47.958 --> 49:50.057
Besides, phasers
fire Nardion particles.

49:50.059 --> 49:51.793
Even if a lightsaber
could deflect those,

49:51.795 --> 49:52.994
which it's not
because it's meant

49:52.996 --> 49:54.595
to deflect pure
energy blaster fire,

49:54.597 --> 49:56.831
the phaser's continuous
beam capability

49:56.833 --> 49:58.833
is gonna trump the Jedi's
arm strength any day.

49:58.835 --> 50:01.737
But they're Jedis.
I think they would be

50:01.739 --> 50:03.771
slaying red shirts before
their arms got tired.

50:03.773 --> 50:06.708
Ah, but you forget about the
wide-beam capability of the phaser.

50:06.710 --> 50:08.876
I did not forget about the wide-beam
capability of the phaser.

50:08.878 --> 50:11.713
The Jedi only has to protect
himself, right, or herself.

50:11.715 --> 50:14.048
Three-foot span of a lightsaber,
that would protect most.

50:14.050 --> 50:16.017
Plus a wide-beam only lands
on a single, flat plane.

50:16.019 --> 50:17.920
Everybody knows that.

50:17.922 --> 50:20.722
Luke, gimme Han,
spells dream team.

50:20.724 --> 50:22.490
Versus Kirk and Spock,
an infallible leader

50:22.492 --> 50:24.827
and his exceedingly
logical sidekick? Please.

50:24.829 --> 50:26.862
You give Han his blaster,
you give Luke his lightsaber...

50:26.864 --> 50:28.796
Ah, shit!

50:28.798 --> 50:30.199
What happened?

50:30.201 --> 50:33.469
I fried a circuit.
It was a custom job.

50:33.471 --> 50:36.671
It took me two years
to build that thing.

50:36.673 --> 50:37.673
Okay, so what do we do now?

50:37.675 --> 50:38.843
Well...

50:40.844 --> 50:42.112
Let me think.

50:44.248 --> 50:46.014
The fuel cells
discharge in parallel,

50:46.016 --> 50:49.985
so I can jumper past
the defective board

50:49.987 --> 50:52.787
but the loss in power
I won't be able to calculate

50:52.789 --> 50:55.125
until the rods are
charged and in place.

51:01.898 --> 51:03.664
<i>Once I get the rods
in place,</i>

51:03.666 --> 51:05.233
<i>I can take
some test readings and see</i>

51:05.235 --> 51:07.702
what kind of a discharge
we'll be able to achieve.

51:07.704 --> 51:09.938
So what number are we
looking for here?

51:09.940 --> 51:12.708
Well, theoretically,
something in the neighborhood

51:12.710 --> 51:17.512
of 500 exa eVs
would be ideal.

51:17.514 --> 51:21.182
But at a minimum
we need to achieve

51:21.184 --> 51:24.786
at least a peta eV
to even think about

51:24.788 --> 51:26.655
opening
the space-time continuum.

51:26.657 --> 51:28.123
So basically you're
saying the amount of energy

51:28.125 --> 51:30.559
we generate with this thing
is directly related

51:30.561 --> 51:33.829
to the amount
of time we can travel, right?

51:33.831 --> 51:35.834
In layman's terms, yes.

51:42.172 --> 51:44.539
What? What happened?

51:44.541 --> 51:47.242
463 peta eVs.

51:47.244 --> 51:48.911
It's quite a power loss,

51:48.913 --> 51:50.912
but, um...

51:50.914 --> 51:51.979
I'd still call
this step a success.

51:51.981 --> 51:55.284
Okay.

51:55.286 --> 51:57.586
<i>So...</i>

51:57.588 --> 51:58.987
when are you going
to come clean

51:58.989 --> 52:02.925
about why you are
really here?

52:02.927 --> 52:04.892
Why I'm really here.
Does it matter?

52:04.894 --> 52:07.929
Of course it matters.

52:07.931 --> 52:10.164
Up until now,
I've been content to allow you

52:10.166 --> 52:15.003
to help me with my research,
assuming that your true reason

52:15.005 --> 52:16.338
for being here
would surface eventually,

52:16.340 --> 52:19.974
but as we approach
what is certain to be

52:19.976 --> 52:22.209
a crossroad
in our experiment,

52:22.211 --> 52:24.845
your true reason
may be an impediment

52:24.847 --> 52:27.014
to our continued
partnership.

52:27.016 --> 52:28.749
How so?

52:28.751 --> 52:31.320
Now, that depends on
why you're really here.

52:31.322 --> 52:32.820
You could be working
for the government

52:32.822 --> 52:34.889
and you're here
to steal my secrets

52:34.891 --> 52:37.325
to use them for
your own nefarious purposes.

52:37.327 --> 52:39.061
You caught me.

52:39.063 --> 52:40.996
I'm kidding.
I don't work for the government.

52:40.998 --> 52:42.930
I'm joking.

52:42.932 --> 52:44.932
I told you,
it's personal.

52:44.934 --> 52:49.239
Eric, you have to explain
yourself better than that.

52:51.342 --> 52:52.807
You really wanna know?

52:52.809 --> 52:55.110
I do.

52:55.112 --> 52:59.347
Okay.

52:59.349 --> 53:02.150
I am, uh...

53:02.152 --> 53:04.086
I'm here about a girl.

53:04.088 --> 53:08.155
I don't know what it is
you think we're doing here,

53:08.157 --> 53:10.025
but I assure you
whatever we accomplish

53:10.027 --> 53:11.760
will have little
consequence in fixing

53:11.762 --> 53:13.961
whatever's wrong
with your love life.

53:13.963 --> 53:16.632
I'm in love.
Okay, I met a girl,

53:16.634 --> 53:22.637
and I fell in love with her
and she is fantastic,

53:22.639 --> 53:24.773
and she inspires me
in ways that I never thought

53:24.775 --> 53:26.374
I could be inspired.

53:26.376 --> 53:28.776
Okay, and I need you
to send me back in time

53:28.778 --> 53:30.945
to a point before
she meets this guy,

53:30.947 --> 53:32.748
this... this guy
she's with now

53:32.750 --> 53:34.016
who she thinks
she's in love with.

53:34.018 --> 53:35.784
I can't send
you back in time.

53:35.786 --> 53:38.387
First of all,
I think you fail to understand

53:38.389 --> 53:40.889
the ramifications
of such an action,

53:40.891 --> 53:43.891
and second,
there's no indication

53:43.893 --> 53:45.193
this device will even work.

53:45.195 --> 53:46.994
Well, you said
that this was possible.

53:46.996 --> 53:48.362
In theory.

53:48.364 --> 53:50.831
There's no way to
test it or prove it.

53:50.833 --> 53:52.300
That's how you
test it, right?

53:52.302 --> 53:53.834
That's how you prove it.
You send me back.

53:53.836 --> 53:55.170
That's the test.

53:55.172 --> 53:56.972
Eric, I'm not
experimenting on you.

53:56.974 --> 53:58.773
There's no way of
knowing what will happen

53:58.775 --> 54:00.141
to someone once
they leave my garage.

54:00.143 --> 54:02.344
Their molecules could be
scattered to the cosmos.

54:02.346 --> 54:04.845
You haven't even
thought through

54:04.847 --> 54:06.782
the situation
you would be in

54:06.784 --> 54:08.749
if and when I could
send you back.

54:08.751 --> 54:10.418
You know,
I'd figure it out.

54:10.420 --> 54:12.054
See, that's what I mean.

54:12.056 --> 54:14.222
You have no idea what
you'd be going back to.

54:14.224 --> 54:16.858
You wouldn't exist.
I mean, yes,

54:16.860 --> 54:18.092
the you from
that timeline would exist

54:18.094 --> 54:20.429
but you, Eric,
you would have no money,

54:20.431 --> 54:22.930
no job,
no identity.

54:22.932 --> 54:24.331
For all intents and purposes,

54:24.333 --> 54:27.235
you'd struggle to survive.

54:27.237 --> 54:29.070
And even if I could
send you back,

54:29.072 --> 54:30.871
I wouldn't do
it for a reason

54:30.873 --> 54:33.340
so trite and juvenile
as lost love.

54:33.342 --> 54:35.376
Trite and juvenile? You know what?
Let me tell you something.

54:35.378 --> 54:36.945
If you've ever been
in love in your life,

54:36.947 --> 54:38.713
you'd know what I
was talking about.

54:38.715 --> 54:41.048
Don't you stand there
and try to pass judgment on me.

54:41.050 --> 54:43.387
You know nothing about me.

54:48.726 --> 54:51.358
I'm sorry, Eric.
I'm sorry.

54:51.360 --> 54:54.396
Look...

54:54.398 --> 54:56.331
you've been
great on the build.

54:56.333 --> 54:58.099
You have been.
I'm eternally grateful.

54:58.101 --> 54:59.834
Yeah, great. You know how
you pay me back?

54:59.836 --> 55:02.806
You send me back.
That's how you pay me back!

55:04.373 --> 55:07.275
That's the only
fucking reason I'm here!

55:07.277 --> 55:08.909
I can't send you back.

55:08.911 --> 55:11.146
Look... these equations,
they're still unsolved.

55:11.148 --> 55:14.849
So unless you
can solve them...

55:14.851 --> 55:16.150
I'm sorry.

55:16.152 --> 55:17.952
Time travel
just isn't possible.

55:17.954 --> 55:19.887
Yeah, you know what?
Fuck it, let's just give up.

55:19.889 --> 55:21.757
We keep trying.
That's what we do.

55:21.759 --> 55:22.958
That's what we've been doing.
We don't give up.

55:22.960 --> 55:24.959
We keep fucking trying!

55:24.961 --> 55:27.297
Time travel is not possible.

55:31.201 --> 55:33.471
So that's it, right?
That's, uh...

55:37.141 --> 55:38.773
This whole thing
has been futile, right?

55:38.775 --> 55:41.543
It's a...
it's a charade?

55:41.545 --> 55:44.845
It's not possible?
It's for nothing?

55:44.847 --> 55:46.481
No, it wasn't for nothing.

55:46.483 --> 55:49.083
We've made great strides
in proving my theories,

55:49.085 --> 55:51.353
strides that will be
hugely beneficial

55:51.355 --> 55:53.822
to mankind in the future.

55:53.824 --> 55:55.791
Where are you going?

55:55.793 --> 55:57.161
You know what? It looks
like I'm going nowhere.

56:01.164 --> 56:03.030
<i>I actually envy you.</i>

56:03.032 --> 56:05.266
You envy the guy that...
guy that's in love

56:05.268 --> 56:08.170
with the girl
he can't have?

56:08.172 --> 56:08.972
No.

56:10.840 --> 56:12.240
I envy the guy
who knows what he wants

56:12.242 --> 56:16.344
and isn't afraid
to go after it.

56:16.346 --> 56:18.313
Even if going after it
looks like

56:18.315 --> 56:21.018
it's gonna result
in a fiery crash?

56:24.121 --> 56:28.055
No, I think
we should all be so lucky

56:28.057 --> 56:33.561
to experience a crash
like that, you know?

56:33.563 --> 56:35.132
I mean, at least
once in our lives.

56:38.268 --> 56:39.436
I suppose.

56:42.438 --> 56:44.472
But I like
to land safe and sound.

56:44.474 --> 56:47.845
I think it's
a way better plan.

56:49.413 --> 56:52.847
Safe and sound, huh?

56:52.849 --> 56:55.016
Let me tell you
something about that.

56:55.018 --> 56:57.985
When I was in school,
everyone thought I was

56:57.987 --> 57:03.358
the wild and
crazy one, you know?

57:03.360 --> 57:06.360
Had to be the first
to do everything.

57:06.362 --> 57:12.032
Truth is...
I was hiding.

57:12.034 --> 57:14.501
I always played it safe.

57:14.503 --> 57:17.072
And look where that got me.

57:17.074 --> 57:20.411
I am bartending in
the middle of fucking nowhere.

57:23.045 --> 57:24.246
So why don't you
get the hell out of here,

57:24.248 --> 57:27.385
you know,
go do something else?

57:29.018 --> 57:31.318
Right.
Well, it's not that easy.

57:31.320 --> 57:34.188
Um, I have
responsibilities.

57:34.190 --> 57:35.557
You know,
I'm not a kid anymore.

57:35.559 --> 57:38.325
I can't sit
in my room and dream.

57:38.327 --> 57:41.195
I gotta make shit work.

57:41.197 --> 57:45.032
I've got debt
I've gotta pay off.

57:45.034 --> 57:47.469
I've got $40 grand
in student loans

57:47.471 --> 57:52.440
because I was so set
on getting a degree...

57:52.442 --> 57:58.213
that did me a lot
of good. Didn't it?

57:58.215 --> 58:00.617
Degrees are a funny thing.

58:02.318 --> 58:04.385
Everyone's got
responsibilities, you know?

58:04.387 --> 58:07.891
It's never too late
to dream, is it?

58:10.092 --> 58:13.063
Sometimes it's too late
to make those dreams a reality.

58:15.065 --> 58:17.097
It just is.

58:17.099 --> 58:18.967
What if you could
go back in time, right,

58:18.969 --> 58:20.568
and change something.

58:20.570 --> 58:22.970
You can change
anything you want.

58:22.972 --> 58:25.106
What would it be?

58:25.108 --> 58:26.307
Wow.

58:26.309 --> 58:27.510
Um...

58:30.213 --> 58:34.048
I would do something
that scared the shit out of me.

58:34.050 --> 58:36.016
I would.

58:36.018 --> 58:39.554
I'd go on an adventure.

58:39.556 --> 58:42.326
I would get
the hell out of here and...

58:44.293 --> 58:49.697
I don't know
if I'd come back.

58:49.699 --> 58:52.266
Okay.
All right.

58:52.268 --> 58:55.336
An adventure.
I like that.

58:55.338 --> 58:56.340
Yeah.

58:59.275 --> 59:03.077
Where to?

59:03.079 --> 59:04.311
Alaska.

59:04.313 --> 59:07.315
I've never been to Alaska.

59:07.317 --> 59:08.717
Me neither.

59:08.719 --> 59:12.220
But I hear
the northern lights

59:12.222 --> 59:16.191
are absolutely breathtaking
this time of year.

59:16.193 --> 59:18.360
And then I don't know.

59:18.362 --> 59:21.396
I would just see
where the universe took me.

59:21.398 --> 59:24.532
I would just...

59:24.534 --> 59:26.237
I'd be free.

59:28.672 --> 59:30.141
Hmm.

59:33.143 --> 59:36.644
You know,
it's a shame...

59:36.646 --> 59:43.017
by the time we figure out
what we really want...

59:43.019 --> 59:44.387
most of the time
it's too late.

59:47.690 --> 59:49.693
Opportunity's lost.

59:51.728 --> 59:53.630
Hadn't thought of it that way.
You're right.

59:59.302 --> 01:00:00.735
Good luck with that girl.

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:40.135
I think I got it.

01:01:40.137 --> 01:01:41.668
All right, I've reworked
the Rosen bridge theory

01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:44.139
with re-evaluated properties
based on Schwartzschild.

01:01:44.141 --> 01:01:45.572
We know that
"c-squared" is broken.

01:01:45.574 --> 01:01:46.807
No, no, that's
Schwartzschild's theory.

01:01:46.809 --> 01:01:48.443
Mitchell fixed those problems.

01:01:48.445 --> 01:01:49.776
But Schwarzschild
achieved the proper values,

01:01:49.778 --> 01:01:51.246
so his equation helps us.

01:01:51.248 --> 01:01:53.213
Look, we know
that the speed of light

01:01:53.215 --> 01:01:55.617
is inconsistent,
which means both sides

01:01:55.619 --> 01:01:57.418
of the equation
are inconsistent.

01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:58.853
All right,
the common factor is r.

01:01:58.855 --> 01:02:01.655
Thus, 2GM equals
inconsistent.

01:02:01.657 --> 01:02:03.224
G and M are
subject to c-squared

01:02:03.226 --> 01:02:04.758
and r based on
irrational polymers.

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:08.565
"i" exists!
And it solves everything.

01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:12.802
She means that much to you?

01:02:14.271 --> 01:02:16.804
She does.

01:02:16.806 --> 01:02:18.773
Okay, if you
are going to do this,

01:02:18.775 --> 01:02:20.474
it has to be soon.

01:02:20.476 --> 01:02:21.876
The rods are decaying
at a much more rapid pace

01:02:21.878 --> 01:02:23.510
than I had
initially calculated.

01:02:23.512 --> 01:02:25.546
According to my estimates,
we should be able to

01:02:25.548 --> 01:02:28.615
generate a discharge
of 16.7 peta eVs.

01:02:28.617 --> 01:02:30.784
Now this is not
what I was hoping for,

01:02:30.786 --> 01:02:33.287
but it should be sufficient
to allow us to connect

01:02:33.289 --> 01:02:36.456
any two moments
in the past five years.

01:02:36.458 --> 01:02:37.791
According
to my calculations,

01:02:37.793 --> 01:02:40.461
you will arrive
in your new reality at 5:00 am,

01:02:40.463 --> 01:02:42.429
November 21st, 2008,

01:02:42.431 --> 01:02:44.831
plus or minus five minutes.

01:02:44.833 --> 01:02:46.767
How's that for irony?

01:02:46.769 --> 01:02:48.735
Even with a time machine.

01:02:48.737 --> 01:02:52.440
I've prepared a survival
kit of sorts for you.

01:02:52.442 --> 01:02:53.740
This should allow you to get

01:02:53.742 --> 01:02:54.976
to where you need to go.

01:02:54.978 --> 01:02:56.510
What's this?

01:02:56.512 --> 01:02:58.979
It's a little bit
of pre-2008 cash,

01:02:58.981 --> 01:03:01.481
my old cell phone,
and the keys to my truck.

01:03:01.483 --> 01:03:03.885
That should allow you
to get to Los Angeles,

01:03:03.887 --> 01:03:06.420
but remember,
once you land in 2008,

01:03:06.422 --> 01:03:07.755
you're gonna
have to figure out

01:03:07.757 --> 01:03:10.226
your long-term survival plan.

01:03:12.929 --> 01:03:15.262
Thank you.

01:03:15.264 --> 01:03:16.731
I don't even know if
the cell phone's gonna work.

01:03:16.733 --> 01:03:17.999
The electrical
interference from the rift

01:03:18.001 --> 01:03:19.300
in the space-time continuum

01:03:19.302 --> 01:03:20.668
will likely fry
the circuits,

01:03:20.670 --> 01:03:23.704
but let's go ahead
and take it anyway.

01:03:23.706 --> 01:03:26.874
I'd like to ask you
a small favor in return.

01:03:26.876 --> 01:03:28.876
Yeah, of course,
anything.

01:03:28.878 --> 01:03:30.744
What do you need?

01:03:30.746 --> 01:03:34.715
The day you arrive
is coincidentally

01:03:34.717 --> 01:03:37.418
the same day
as my lab accident.

01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:39.019
Irony all around.

01:03:39.021 --> 01:03:41.688
Why didn't that make
national news, by the way?

01:03:41.690 --> 01:03:43.490
It did,
but the opening

01:03:43.492 --> 01:03:46.894
of some teen romance
vampire movie

01:03:46.896 --> 01:03:48.829
stole the headlines
that day.

01:03:48.831 --> 01:03:52.700
Anyway, I need you
to get this to me

01:03:52.702 --> 01:03:55.036
by 7:30 PM.
That's important.

01:03:55.038 --> 01:03:57.405
That should prevent me
from blowing up the lab

01:03:57.407 --> 01:03:59.574
in that timeframe and
it's a six hour drive

01:03:59.576 --> 01:04:03.378
to Los Angeles, so you should
have plenty of time.

01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:05.445
Well...

01:04:05.447 --> 01:04:06.546
we should get going.

01:04:06.548 --> 01:04:08.552
Are you ready?

01:04:13.722 --> 01:04:15.023
Sure.

01:04:15.025 --> 01:04:17.758
Eric, you must be
absolutely certain.

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:19.829
There's no coming
back from this.

01:04:21.931 --> 01:04:23.367
Yeah, I know.

01:04:25.434 --> 01:04:27.834
I know.
I'm sure, yes.

01:04:27.836 --> 01:04:30.438
Okay.

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:31.773
Let's do it.

01:04:31.775 --> 01:04:33.840
A historic moment.

01:04:33.842 --> 01:04:35.742
For sure.

01:04:35.744 --> 01:04:38.915
The first trip ever
through time.

01:04:41.751 --> 01:04:44.751
You know,
it's comforting to know

01:04:44.753 --> 01:04:48.990
that while me
in my current form

01:04:48.992 --> 01:04:52.025
will not feel the effects,

01:04:52.027 --> 01:04:53.494
there will be a copy of me

01:04:53.496 --> 01:04:55.798
in another reality
who will...

01:04:58.534 --> 01:05:01.802
now have the opportunity
for a better life.

01:05:14.884 --> 01:05:17.751
That's the saddest thing
I ever heard.

01:05:17.753 --> 01:05:18.920
I'm sorry.

01:05:18.922 --> 01:05:21.923
Oh, Eric,
don't be sorry.

01:05:21.925 --> 01:05:25.959
You gave me a second chance
to feel alive again,

01:05:25.961 --> 01:05:30.798
and for that...

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:32.803
you deserve your chance.

01:05:35.938 --> 01:05:39.941
I don't even know
what to say to you.

01:05:39.943 --> 01:05:41.575
There's nothing to say.
Get up there.

01:05:41.577 --> 01:05:43.411
Get up there.

01:05:43.413 --> 01:05:45.815
Come here.
Come here.

01:05:47.717 --> 01:05:49.516
Oh, thank you.

01:05:49.518 --> 01:05:50.987
You're welcome.

01:05:52.722 --> 01:05:53.924
Go get her.

01:06:08.070 --> 01:06:09.970
May the Force be with you.

01:06:35.798 --> 01:06:38.766
Aah!

01:07:17.139 --> 01:07:20.777
Okay, this is a "starter"?

01:07:35.757 --> 01:07:39.025
All right,
all right, all right.

01:07:43.867 --> 01:07:45.932
Here we go.

01:07:45.934 --> 01:07:48.168
Come on, come on, baby.
Come on.

01:08:07.123 --> 01:08:10.157
All right, all right,
what do you want from me?

01:08:12.728 --> 01:08:13.728
Fuck!

01:08:13.730 --> 01:08:15.262
Come on,
goddammit.

01:08:15.264 --> 01:08:16.466
Shit!

01:08:27.810 --> 01:08:31.912
All right, the hard way.

01:09:33.908 --> 01:09:36.242
Hey!

01:09:36.243 --> 01:09:37.247
Ally.

01:09:44.118 --> 01:09:46.086
Do I know you?

01:09:46.087 --> 01:09:49.723
Uh, no, not yet.

01:09:49.725 --> 01:09:55.028
Um, you're Ally, right?

01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:57.764
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:09:57.766 --> 01:10:00.800
Well, I'm the only Ally
within the next ten miles.

01:10:00.802 --> 01:10:02.803
There was this other girl
who was calling herself that,

01:10:02.805 --> 01:10:05.238
but she changed it to "Ash"
'cause her name is...

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:06.243
Ashley?

01:10:09.145 --> 01:10:10.811
Right.

01:10:10.813 --> 01:10:13.781
Okay, so, you know my name,

01:10:13.783 --> 01:10:16.150
which is weird.

01:10:16.152 --> 01:10:20.888
So, care to get on
even ground with me?

01:10:20.890 --> 01:10:23.089
Yeah, uh, right.
Sorry.

01:10:23.091 --> 01:10:25.692
Eric. Eric.
Good to meet you.

01:10:25.694 --> 01:10:28.862
- Ally.
- Yeah, I know.

01:10:28.864 --> 01:10:32.098
So, Eric,

01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:33.800
What, uh,

01:10:33.802 --> 01:10:38.238
what brings you to this
fine establishment today?

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:41.942
Um, I actually... my... my
truck broke down up the road,

01:10:41.944 --> 01:10:43.177
so I'm sort of stranded.

01:10:43.179 --> 01:10:44.945
- Oh, yeah?
- Stranded here, yeah.

01:10:44.947 --> 01:10:46.813
- That's a bummer.
- Right.

01:10:46.815 --> 01:10:49.849
Well, you want me to
call you a tow truck?

01:10:49.851 --> 01:10:53.120
No, no, no.
Actually, can I borrow a phone?

01:10:53.122 --> 01:10:56.156
- Well, yeah.
- Yeah?

01:10:56.158 --> 01:10:57.758
Yeah,
I got one right here.

01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:59.192
Okay, thanks.

01:10:59.194 --> 01:11:01.861
Just gonna make a quick
phone call to a friend.

01:11:01.863 --> 01:11:03.666
Be quick,
it's pre-pay.

01:11:05.835 --> 01:11:06.837
Thank you.

01:11:30.292 --> 01:11:31.726
Hello?

01:11:31.728 --> 01:11:32.759
Kal, hey, listen.
It's Eric.

01:11:32.761 --> 01:11:34.061
Oh, hey, what's up, Eric?

01:11:34.063 --> 01:11:35.929
Listen, I need you
to come pick me up.

01:11:35.931 --> 01:11:37.430
I'm in Arizona right now,
just stop doing

01:11:37.432 --> 01:11:39.433
whatever you're doing
and come get me.

01:11:39.435 --> 01:11:41.102
If you woke me up
this early for a joke

01:11:41.104 --> 01:11:42.335
I'm going
back to bed.

01:11:42.337 --> 01:11:44.037
No, I'm not joking.
Listen,

01:11:44.039 --> 01:11:45.473
I'm in Northern Arizona,
I need you to come get me

01:11:45.475 --> 01:11:46.906
and it's an
emergency.

01:11:46.908 --> 01:11:48.409
Just hurry up,
will you?

01:11:48.411 --> 01:11:50.177
Tell me where
you are.

01:11:50.179 --> 01:11:55.918
It's 11742 Hickory Way
in Grand River, Arizona.

01:11:58.287 --> 01:12:00.057
All right.

01:12:01.791 --> 01:12:04.391
You... are
a lifesaver.

01:12:04.393 --> 01:12:09.028
Thank you.
I've been told that before.

01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:13.467
You know, I, uh,
it's the weirdest thing.

01:12:13.469 --> 01:12:16.937
I've been in town
for a couple of hours

01:12:16.939 --> 01:12:17.972
and I got nothing
but headaches.

01:12:17.974 --> 01:12:20.374
That'll be 1.02.

01:12:20.376 --> 01:12:24.277
Oh, yeah?
The town's really not that bad

01:12:24.279 --> 01:12:26.147
if you give
it a chance.

01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:29.150
I'm not sure it's the town
as much as it is the year.

01:12:29.152 --> 01:12:30.785
What?

01:12:30.787 --> 01:12:33.920
Uh, I'm probably
just dehydrated.

01:12:33.922 --> 01:12:36.456
Oh, yeah,
that happens.

01:12:36.458 --> 01:12:39.058
Fluid's in me.
You got a map, by chance,

01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:41.128
of Arizona I could
take a peek at?

01:12:41.130 --> 01:12:42.332
Sure.

01:12:45.967 --> 01:12:47.034
Yeah, here you go.

01:12:47.036 --> 01:12:48.369
Thank you.

01:12:48.371 --> 01:12:51.371
Can I have it?
Thank you.

01:12:51.373 --> 01:12:52.540
You're welcome.

01:12:52.542 --> 01:12:54.745
So you like working here,
or what?

01:12:57.145 --> 01:12:58.879
It's okay.

01:12:58.881 --> 01:13:01.415
You know,
it pays the bills.

01:13:01.417 --> 01:13:05.919
I'm working here to pay
my way through college.

01:13:05.921 --> 01:13:09.255
Well, it's either that or
be a stripper, so...

01:13:09.257 --> 01:13:10.825
I'm kidding.

01:13:10.827 --> 01:13:13.027
This town doesn't
even have a strip club.

01:13:13.029 --> 01:13:16.496
You ever... you ever think about
getting out of here?

01:13:16.498 --> 01:13:19.333
So I can be
a stripper?

01:13:19.335 --> 01:13:22.969
No. No, I wasn't
thinking about that.

01:13:22.971 --> 01:13:24.437
I mean, you know,
get out of here,

01:13:24.439 --> 01:13:26.607
do something
more adventurous.

01:13:26.609 --> 01:13:31.445
Yeah.
Sometimes, right?

01:13:31.447 --> 01:13:33.513
Well, don't wait
too long, okay?

01:13:33.515 --> 01:13:37.151
You might... you might miss
your window.

01:13:37.153 --> 01:13:38.919
Gee, thanks.

01:13:38.921 --> 01:13:43.223
That's sage advice
from a total weirdo.

01:13:43.225 --> 01:13:45.058
You think I'm a
total weirdo?

01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:46.293
Yeah.

01:13:46.295 --> 01:13:47.928
I mean, like,
in a good way.

01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:49.530
You're like, um...

01:13:49.532 --> 01:13:51.534
like Thomas Jerome Newton.

01:13:54.069 --> 01:13:58.606
You know, "The Man
Who Fell to Earth"?

01:13:58.608 --> 01:14:03.043
David Bowie?
1976.

01:14:03.045 --> 01:14:04.311
You need to watch
more movies, man.

01:14:04.313 --> 01:14:06.146
I will make sure
I put that one

01:14:06.148 --> 01:14:07.580
on my
instant queue.

01:14:07.582 --> 01:14:09.183
Your instant what?

01:14:09.185 --> 01:14:11.518
Never mind.

01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:14.053
Weirdo.

01:14:16.024 --> 01:14:17.458
Hey, baby.
How much?

01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:18.592
Kal! What's up?

01:14:18.594 --> 01:14:22.495
Hey, man! Ahh!

01:14:22.497 --> 01:14:24.365
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:14:24.367 --> 01:14:25.566
There's something
different about you.

01:14:25.568 --> 01:14:26.933
Uh, maybe I
look a little older.

01:14:26.935 --> 01:14:28.669
Yeah, maybe.

01:14:28.671 --> 01:14:31.037
So what are you
doing in Arizona, dude?

01:14:31.039 --> 01:14:32.373
Long story, you wouldn't
believe me if I told you.

01:14:32.375 --> 01:14:34.008
How long did it take
you to get here anyway?

01:14:34.010 --> 01:14:35.375
I left at like
quarter to eight so...

01:14:35.377 --> 01:14:36.910
I don't know,
five and a half hours?

01:14:36.912 --> 01:14:38.044
Five and a half? All right.
We gotta go.

01:14:38.046 --> 01:14:39.281
I'll explain in the car,
come on.

01:14:49.992 --> 01:14:52.092
So, let me get
this straight.

01:14:52.094 --> 01:14:55.028
You traveled back in
time so you are you,

01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:56.562
but you're not
really you.

01:14:56.564 --> 01:14:58.331
Sort of. I mean,
Yes and no.

01:14:58.333 --> 01:15:01.634
I am me, I'm just not
the me from this time.

01:15:01.636 --> 01:15:03.303
Well, isn't that
what I just said?

01:15:03.305 --> 01:15:04.537
What? Are we playing
"Who's on First" here?

01:15:04.539 --> 01:15:06.040
- Come on.
- It's complicated.

01:15:06.042 --> 01:15:07.407
No, no, I get it.
I understand that part,

01:15:07.409 --> 01:15:11.111
what I don't
understand is... why?

01:15:11.113 --> 01:15:12.713
Honestly?

01:15:12.715 --> 01:15:15.081
No, dishonestly. Look,
I want you to tell me

01:15:15.083 --> 01:15:16.549
that you came back
for Katy Perry

01:15:16.551 --> 01:15:17.550
'cause you found out
she was lying about it

01:15:17.552 --> 01:15:18.952
when she
kissed that girl

01:15:18.954 --> 01:15:20.955
so it shattered
your reality so bad

01:15:20.957 --> 01:15:22.589
that you had to come
back to a simpler time.

01:15:22.591 --> 01:15:25.291
Yes, honestly! What kind
of question is that?

01:15:25.293 --> 01:15:26.593
I'm in love.

01:15:26.595 --> 01:15:28.963
With Katy Perry?
Or the girl she kissed?

01:15:28.965 --> 01:15:31.231
No, neither,
it's a different girl.

01:15:31.233 --> 01:15:32.366
It's a completely
different girl.

01:15:32.368 --> 01:15:34.233
It's not
Katy Perry,

01:15:34.235 --> 01:15:36.003
it's a different
girl entirely.

01:15:36.005 --> 01:15:38.237
Oh, man, did she
die or something?

01:15:38.239 --> 01:15:41.075
No, no, she's just,
uh, you know...

01:15:41.077 --> 01:15:42.442
she's unavailable.

01:15:42.444 --> 01:15:44.678
Unavailable?
What the hell does that mean?

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:48.382
Wow, is she in prison?
Yeah!

01:15:48.384 --> 01:15:50.217
No, she's not
in prison.

01:15:50.219 --> 01:15:53.086
She's, uh, engaged.

01:15:53.088 --> 01:15:56.357
Whoa. Uh-oh.
That's not good.

01:15:56.359 --> 01:15:58.258
What do you mean?

01:15:58.260 --> 01:15:59.628
What if she says no?

01:16:02.264 --> 01:16:04.430
No, she can't...
she's not gonna say no,

01:16:04.432 --> 01:16:06.200
okay?
Just we clicked,

01:16:06.202 --> 01:16:09.169
we got a thing,
she's not gonna say no.

01:16:09.171 --> 01:16:11.237
So in five
years you click,

01:16:11.239 --> 01:16:13.173
but you have no idea
who this girl is now.

01:16:13.175 --> 01:16:15.275
What if you don't even
dig the younger her?

01:16:15.277 --> 01:16:18.012
I know who she becomes
and I dig that, so...

01:16:18.014 --> 01:16:19.245
Yeah, but if she
meets you now

01:16:19.247 --> 01:16:21.415
she may never
even become that person.

01:16:21.417 --> 01:16:23.083
Why are you being such a Debbie
Downer, man? It's gonna work out.

01:16:23.085 --> 01:16:25.218
Look, I invented time travel
for this girl, okay?

01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:26.586
- It's just reality.
- I traveled through time for this girl.

01:16:26.588 --> 01:16:28.121
It's going to work.

01:16:28.123 --> 01:16:29.690
She's not gonna
say no, it's fine.

01:16:29.692 --> 01:16:31.627
Okay.

01:16:35.296 --> 01:16:37.498
So, where exactly am
I dropping you off?

01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:39.032
South Hills Mall.

01:16:39.034 --> 01:16:41.402
But I need you to
take me to CCS first.

01:16:41.404 --> 01:16:44.103
CCS... are
you crazy?

01:16:44.105 --> 01:16:45.705
That's all the way
over on the West Side.

01:16:45.707 --> 01:16:48.041
It'll take us at least
an hour to get there.

01:16:48.043 --> 01:16:49.509
We're not going to be
back to South Hills Mall

01:16:49.511 --> 01:16:51.178
by 6:45.

01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:54.113
Fuck.
All right, uh,

01:16:54.115 --> 01:16:55.516
let me borrow your phone.
You got a phone?

01:16:55.518 --> 01:16:57.651
Yeah, yeah,
it's right here.

01:16:57.653 --> 01:16:59.585
What is this? You got
internet on this thing?

01:16:59.587 --> 01:17:02.688
No, it's not a computer.
Crazy.

01:17:02.690 --> 01:17:05.692
Internet on
a phone...

01:17:05.694 --> 01:17:08.161
Hi, yeah, I need you to
give me the number

01:17:08.163 --> 01:17:11.065
for the California
College of Science.

01:17:11.067 --> 01:17:12.732
Yeah, that's
the one.

01:17:12.734 --> 01:17:14.601
You got a pen?

01:17:14.603 --> 01:17:17.673
Yup. What is it?

01:17:19.074 --> 01:17:20.676
49, All right,
thank you very much.

01:17:30.719 --> 01:17:34.088
Hi, yeah, I need to speak
to a Dr. Joseph Goyer.

01:17:34.090 --> 01:17:36.723
He's in your...
Yes, that's exactly right.

01:17:36.725 --> 01:17:40.527
That Joseph Goyer, please.

01:17:40.529 --> 01:17:43.464
No, I understand.
Listen, it's very important.

01:17:43.466 --> 01:17:45.665
Right, no I heard
you the first time.

01:17:45.667 --> 01:17:46.834
Listen, hmm...

01:17:46.836 --> 01:17:48.468
just get him on
the phone, please.

01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:50.803
Just get him...

01:17:50.805 --> 01:17:53.773
The heck?
She hung up on me.

01:17:53.775 --> 01:17:54.741
Dude, you gotta talk her up, man.
Try to sound sexy.

01:17:54.743 --> 01:17:57.143
- I'm calling her back.
- Let me talk to her.

01:17:57.145 --> 01:17:58.347
No, no, no, I'm not gonna
let you talk to her.

01:18:01.484 --> 01:18:04.418
Hi, yeah, you know what? I think
we just got disconnected.

01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:06.786
I was hoping to speak
to Dr. Joseph Goyer.

01:18:06.788 --> 01:18:08.222
Hello?

01:18:08.224 --> 01:18:09.589
Fuck! This bitch
hung up on me.

01:18:09.591 --> 01:18:11.126
Goddammit.

01:18:12.127 --> 01:18:15.696
How rude.

01:18:15.698 --> 01:18:18.334
So where am I taking you?
CCS or the mall?

01:18:20.735 --> 01:18:22.535
How far to
the mall?

01:18:22.537 --> 01:18:23.870
From here,
like, 20 minutes.

01:18:23.872 --> 01:18:27.540
Give or take.

01:18:27.542 --> 01:18:29.311
Fuck! Yeah, we gotta
go to the mall.

01:18:33.349 --> 01:18:35.284
- Right here?
- Yeah, this is good. Thanks, buddy.

01:18:41.556 --> 01:18:44.157
- Hey, let me ask you something.
- Yeah?

01:18:44.159 --> 01:18:46.793
What am I like
in the future?

01:18:46.795 --> 01:18:48.794
Pretty much
the same guy.

01:18:48.796 --> 01:18:50.330
- Still awesome?
- Yeah.

01:18:50.332 --> 01:18:51.898
- Score! Ha-ha!
- Yeah.

01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:55.501
Oh, you do come out
of the closet, though.

01:18:55.503 --> 01:18:57.437
- Wait, what?
- Yeah.

01:18:57.439 --> 01:18:59.606
Hey!
What? I'm not...

01:18:59.608 --> 01:19:02.375
wait, what are you
saying, I'm gay?

01:19:02.377 --> 01:19:04.745
Are you fucking
with me?

01:19:04.747 --> 01:19:06.479
He's just
fucking with me, right?

01:19:06.481 --> 01:19:08.382
I'm not gay, am I?

01:19:08.384 --> 01:19:11.218
No. If I was I'd totally
know it by now.

01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:12.952
Yeah, he's just
fucking with me.

01:19:12.954 --> 01:19:14.420
Wait, is he?

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:48.589
Hey.

01:19:48.591 --> 01:19:50.426
Um...

01:19:52.761 --> 01:19:55.661
listen, this is
going to sound, um,

01:19:55.663 --> 01:19:56.830
borderline insane.

01:19:56.832 --> 01:19:58.665
Um...

01:19:58.667 --> 01:20:00.601
I've got these two tickets
to the new "Twilight" film.

01:20:00.603 --> 01:20:02.302
I was going to
take my little sister

01:20:02.304 --> 01:20:04.338
and she got sick,
so now I'm stuck with

01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:07.907
these two tickets to
"Twilight" and, um,

01:20:07.909 --> 01:20:09.809
anyway, I was wondering
would you, uh,

01:20:09.811 --> 01:20:11.344
would you want to go with me?
This "Twilight"?

01:20:11.346 --> 01:20:14.647
You were
right, that is insane

01:20:14.649 --> 01:20:16.415
because that movie
looks like total garbage.

01:20:16.417 --> 01:20:17.884
Sorry.

01:20:17.886 --> 01:20:20.586
Yeah, well, you know what?
It is? It's trash.

01:20:20.588 --> 01:20:23.322
Um, but I've
got the tickets

01:20:23.324 --> 01:20:26.492
and I thought why
let 'em go to waste?

01:20:26.494 --> 01:20:28.728
Oh, actually I think
you can just cash 'em in

01:20:28.730 --> 01:20:30.363
as long as the movie
hasn't started yet.

01:20:30.365 --> 01:20:32.465
No.
Is that true?

01:20:32.467 --> 01:20:34.601
- Yeah.
- You're kidding me.

01:20:34.603 --> 01:20:38.004
That's horrible.
Horrible news.

01:20:38.006 --> 01:20:41.375
Um, I'm gonna
level with you.

01:20:41.377 --> 01:20:44.277
I don't have
tickets to "Twilight."

01:20:44.279 --> 01:20:46.679
I was walking, I looked
up and I saw your face

01:20:46.681 --> 01:20:51.285
and I thought, "that girl is stunning
and I've gotta go ask her out,"

01:20:51.287 --> 01:20:53.019
and the first thing that
came out of my mouth

01:20:53.021 --> 01:20:56.723
was that stupid "Twilight"
line and I am sorry.

01:20:56.725 --> 01:20:58.825
Wow.

01:20:58.827 --> 01:21:02.062
You know, I think that might be the
worst pick-up line I've ever heard.

01:21:02.064 --> 01:21:05.766
I don't think that would
ever work on anyone.

01:21:05.768 --> 01:21:07.067
Really?

01:21:07.069 --> 01:21:10.937
At least not in
this universe.

01:21:10.939 --> 01:21:12.505
Let me see the
kaleidoscope.

01:21:12.507 --> 01:21:14.441
You know, next time
you might just want to

01:21:14.443 --> 01:21:16.343
go with the
traditional route of

01:21:16.345 --> 01:21:18.512
"do you want to grab
a cup of coffee?"

01:21:18.514 --> 01:21:20.449
No, it's mine!

01:21:22.917 --> 01:21:24.418
Let go!

01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:27.724
Look what you did.
You broke it!

01:21:29.625 --> 01:21:31.791
You know what?
Thank you.

01:21:31.793 --> 01:21:33.326
For what?

01:21:33.328 --> 01:21:35.394
For inspiring me to
do something great.

01:21:35.396 --> 01:21:37.597
Thank you.

01:21:45.474 --> 01:21:47.107
How fast can you
get me to CCS?

01:21:47.109 --> 01:21:49.041
I'm Kal...
get in.

01:21:56.885 --> 01:21:58.418
- Punch it!
- Whoo!

01:22:00.521 --> 01:22:02.656
Excuse me, excuse me,
excuse me!

01:22:02.658 --> 01:22:04.458
Hey, authorized personnel
only beyond this point, sir.

01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:05.959
You gotta be kidding me,
you again?

01:22:05.961 --> 01:22:07.561
I'm sorry, have we met before?
I don't recall.

01:22:07.563 --> 01:22:09.463
Listen, I need to talk to
Dr. Joseph Goyer.

01:22:09.465 --> 01:22:11.430
Ah, the doctor is
about to oversee

01:22:11.432 --> 01:22:13.133
a very important experiment.
Authorized personnel only, sir.

01:22:13.135 --> 01:22:14.867
Do you understand
the gravity of the-

01:22:14.869 --> 01:22:17.103
Sir! If you do not calmly
back away I am authorized

01:22:17.105 --> 01:22:21.141
to use an appropriate
level of force to ex... no!

01:22:21.143 --> 01:22:22.742
Hey...

01:22:22.744 --> 01:22:24.747
be nice to people.
Be nice.

01:22:29.518 --> 01:22:31.020
Dr. Goyer!

01:22:35.390 --> 01:22:37.958
What is the meaning of this?
Who are you?

01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:40.126
We're about to start a very
complex and dangerous experiment.

01:22:40.128 --> 01:22:41.762
What do you want?

01:22:41.764 --> 01:22:43.095
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Does that mean anything to you?

01:22:53.542 --> 01:22:55.674
You're sure I can't
convince you to stay?

01:22:55.676 --> 01:22:57.410
You're a great
lab assistant.

01:22:57.412 --> 01:23:01.947
Uh, yeah,
I think the universe

01:23:01.949 --> 01:23:04.617
has something more in
store for me, actually.

01:23:04.619 --> 01:23:06.652
Well, it's a pleasure
meeting you, Eric.

01:23:06.654 --> 01:23:08.687
You too.
Thanks for your hospitality,

01:23:08.689 --> 01:23:10.824
- I appreciate that.
- Oh, you're welcome.

01:23:10.826 --> 01:23:13.559
If you ever
need anything...

01:23:13.561 --> 01:23:15.128
don't hesitate
to ask.

01:23:15.130 --> 01:23:18.031
Thank you.
You too.

01:23:18.033 --> 01:23:22.134
All right, this is me.

01:23:22.136 --> 01:23:23.669
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

01:24:13.822 --> 01:24:15.458
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:22.661
Uh, this is going to
sound a little bit crazy.

01:24:22.663 --> 01:24:25.165
Um...

01:24:25.167 --> 01:24:28.701
would you like to go on
an adventure with me?

01:24:28.703 --> 01:24:31.804
- An adventure?
- Yeah.

01:24:31.806 --> 01:24:35.875
I don't know. It depends...
where?

01:24:35.877 --> 01:24:38.978
I hear the Northern Lights
of Alaska are

01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:43.016
absolutely breathtaking
this time of year.
