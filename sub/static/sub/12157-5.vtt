WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.304
COME ON, KRISTIN,

00:03.337 --> 00:04.805
WE SHOULD TOTALLY
GO CLUBBING THIS WEEKEND!

00:04.838 --> 00:06.974
YOU ARE TOO YOUNG
TO GO TO BARS, MANDY.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.476
NO. THIS IS NOT ABOUT ME.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.211
IT'S ABOUT GETTING YOU
OUT OF THOSE SWEATPANTS.

00:10.244 --> 00:12.846
OR AT LEAST GETTING SOMEONE
ELSE IN 'EM! WHAT?!

00:12.880 --> 00:14.882
(laughs) NO, COME ON.

00:14.915 --> 00:16.484
BOYD IS GONNA BE
WITH HIS DAD ALL WEEKEND.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.419
IT'S PERFECT.
WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU?

00:18.452 --> 00:20.821
QUALITY TIME
WITH MY BIG SIS...

00:20.854 --> 00:23.257
WHO CAN ALSO PASS
AS MY LEGAL GUARDIAN.

00:23.291 --> 00:24.658
MM.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.827
PEOPLE ALREADY THINK
YOU'RE MY MOM!

00:26.860 --> 00:29.597
OH-HO-HO! IN THAT CASE,
YOU'RE GROUNDED.

00:29.630 --> 00:30.898
WHAT?

00:30.931 --> 00:33.033
HEY, I MAY BE TOO YOUNG
TO DRINK IN COLORADO...

00:33.067 --> 00:35.769
(singsongy) BUT NOTHING
FORBIDS ME FROM DOING THIS!

00:35.803 --> 00:37.738
YEAH!
OH...

00:41.742 --> 00:43.277
IF--

00:43.311 --> 00:45.012
HEY, STOP!

00:45.045 --> 00:46.347
NO.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.682
YOU DO THAT IN UTAH,
YOU'RE GONNA GO TO JAIL.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.050
YES!

00:50.084 --> 00:51.685
(Boyd) MOMMY, HURRY UP!

00:51.719 --> 00:52.786
JUST A MINUTE!

00:52.820 --> 00:54.021
BOYD'S STILL AWAKE?

00:54.054 --> 00:55.689
YOU STARTED PUTTING HIM
TO BED AN HOUR AGO.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.891
YEAH, ALMOST THERE. HE LIKES
HIS BLANKIE NICE AND WARM,

00:57.925 --> 00:59.860
SO I HEAT IT UP
FOR HIM IN THE DRYER.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.130
I USED TO HEAT MY BROTHER'S
BLANKET UP IN THE DRYER.

01:02.163 --> 01:05.733
YEAH, THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS
HE WAS STILL HOLDING IT.
(chuckles)

01:05.766 --> 01:07.735
BOYD'S WARM BLANKIE IS JUST
ONE OF OUR BEDTIME RITUALS.

01:07.768 --> 01:10.804
WE HAVE BATH TIME,
STORY TIME, TICKLE TIME.

01:10.838 --> 01:13.407
YEAH, YOUR FATHER AND I
HAVE THAT, TOO. (giggles)

01:13.441 --> 01:15.776
(Eve, Kristin, and Mandy) EW!

01:17.145 --> 01:18.912
DAD, DID YOU REMEMBER
TOMORROW'S CAREER DAY?

01:18.946 --> 01:20.548
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
YOU KNOW, BUT I WANT YOU

01:20.581 --> 01:22.916
TO TELL YOUR TEACHER I WANT
TO CLOSE THE SHOW THIS TIME.

01:22.950 --> 01:24.785
I'M NOT OPENING UP
FOR THAT FIREMAN.

01:24.818 --> 01:27.955
ACTUALLY, DAD, MY CLASS
LOVED YOUR, UM...

01:27.988 --> 01:29.490
CROSSBOW DEMONSTRATION.

01:29.523 --> 01:31.659
MADE AARON JAHOOBI
PEE HIMSELF. (laughs)
OHH...

01:31.692 --> 01:33.394
I PUT AN APPLE
ON THE KID'S HEAD,

01:33.427 --> 01:34.728
AND FOR THE RECORD,
HAD HE NOT WHIZZED,

01:34.762 --> 01:36.830
I THINK I COULD HAVE
NAILED IT.

01:36.864 --> 01:38.766
HEY, HOW COME MOM
HAS NEVER SPOKEN

01:38.799 --> 01:40.668
AT ONE OF OUR SCHOOL
CAREER DAYS?
OH--

01:40.701 --> 01:42.136
YEAH, THAT'S
A GOOD QUESTION.

01:42.170 --> 01:43.737
NO, WHAT I DO ISN'T
THAT INTERESTING. IT'S...

01:43.771 --> 01:45.573
YEAH, IT IS, TOO.
NO--

01:45.606 --> 01:48.142
YOU'RE A BIG SHOT GEOSCIENTIST
AT PAXON ENERGY.
OH... YEAH.

01:48.176 --> 01:50.077
IN CHARGE OF SEISMIC
DISCOVERY

01:50.110 --> 01:52.646
OF NATURAL SHALE GAS
RESERVOIRS.

01:52.680 --> 01:53.781
IT'S... (mutters)

01:53.814 --> 01:54.815
(chuckles and coughs) NERD!

01:54.848 --> 01:57.951
(coughs) NERD!

01:57.985 --> 02:00.821
DAD, WOULD YOU MIND IF I ASKED
MOM TO SPEAK INSTEAD OF YOU?

02:00.854 --> 02:02.856
I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA.
IT REALLY IS.

02:02.890 --> 02:05.259
BESIDES, MY SPEECHES TEND
TO BE KIND OF INFORMATIVE.

02:05.293 --> 02:07.961
WHICH GETS ME IN TROUBLE
WITH THE TEACHERS' UNION.

02:07.995 --> 02:11.031
KIDS ACTUALLY LEARNING
SOMETHING.
(Vanessa groans)

02:11.064 --> 02:13.367
I'D LOVE TO, THEN.
(laughs) OKAY.

02:13.401 --> 02:15.803
MAYBE I COULD DO A PRESENTATION
ON THE ROLE OF SHALE GAS

02:15.836 --> 02:17.271
IN AMERICA'S
ENERGY FUTURE.
OH.

02:17.305 --> 02:18.706
YEAH.
THAT'LL BE INTERESTING.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.476
YOU MIGHT WANT TO GO
BEFORE THE FIREMAN.

02:24.212 --> 02:28.148
-- Captions by VITA --

02:31.018 --> 02:34.555
THE HYDRAULIC MIXTURE
BREAKS APART THE SHALE

02:34.588 --> 02:36.790
AND RELEASES THE TRAPPED GAS.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.726
(boys laugh)

02:38.759 --> 02:41.262
I-I KNEW THAT WOULD GET
THE BOYS' ATTENTION.

02:42.396 --> 02:43.897
YOUR MOM'S PRETTY COOL.

02:43.931 --> 02:47.000
(scoffs) COOL?
SHE'S FREAKIN' AWESOME.

02:47.034 --> 02:49.670
AND ONE DAY... (lowered voice)
I'M GONNA HAVE A RACK LIKE THAT.

02:53.040 --> 02:55.443
THANK YOU, MRS. BAXTER.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.480
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS
FOR OUR SPEAKER?

02:59.513 --> 03:02.049
OH. WOW. UH, UH, MARJORIE.
HEY.

03:02.082 --> 03:03.984
ISN'T THAT STUFF
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT

03:04.017 --> 03:06.019
ALSO CALLED FRACKING?

03:06.053 --> 03:07.821
UH, YEAH, YEAH,
BUT THAT TERM

03:07.855 --> 03:09.823
CARRIES A NEGATIVE
CONNOTATION.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.392
WHAT ABOUT POISONING
THE GROUND WATER?

03:11.425 --> 03:13.026
IS THAT A NICER WAY
OF SAYING IT?

03:15.062 --> 03:17.398
AND IT ISN'T EVEN REGULATED
BY THE GOVERNMENT, RIGHT?

03:17.431 --> 03:18.866
WELL, NO, THAT'S NOT
COMPLETELY--

03:18.899 --> 03:21.269
HYDRAULIC FRACTURING HAS BEEN
BANNED IN SEVERAL STATES.

03:21.302 --> 03:23.203
WOW, IT MUST BE REALLY BAD.

03:23.237 --> 03:25.406
NO, THE TRUTH
OF THE MATTER IS--
I SAW A DOCUMENTARY

03:25.439 --> 03:29.610
WHERE THIS GUY TOTALLY
LIT HIS TAP WATER ON FIRE!

03:29.643 --> 03:31.044
AND HAVEN'T STUDIES SHOWN

03:31.078 --> 03:33.847
THAT FRACKING SOMETIMES
LEADS TO CANCER?

03:33.881 --> 03:37.885
REALLY? I NEED THIS
FROM YOU, TOO?

03:37.918 --> 03:40.020
WHY DOES YOUR MOM
HATE THE ENVIRONMENT?

03:40.053 --> 03:41.855
(girl) MRS. BAXTER?
(boy) MRS. BAXTER?

03:41.889 --> 03:44.057
(girl) MRS. BAXTER?
(boy) MRS. BAXTER?

03:44.091 --> 03:46.994
MRS. BAXTER?
MRS. BAXTER?

03:48.496 --> 03:50.564
SO HERE ARE HIS CLOTHES,

03:50.598 --> 03:52.700
HIS BOOKS, SOME TOYS,
HIS FAVORITE PILLOW,

03:52.733 --> 03:54.935
HIS BLANKIE, AND HIS
BACKUP BLANKIE, OF COURSE.

03:54.968 --> 03:57.070
YOU'VE SEEN
MY APARTMENT, RIGHT?

03:57.104 --> 04:00.073
THERE'S NOT GONNA BE
ROOM FOR BOYD.

04:00.107 --> 04:03.744
WATER WINGS? FOR WHAT,
THE BATHTUB?

04:03.777 --> 04:06.780
OH, MY GOD, THEY ARE
FOR THE BATHTUB?

04:06.814 --> 04:08.716
PROMISE ME YOU WILL USE THEM,
AND DON'T FORGET

04:08.749 --> 04:10.083
TO WARM UP HIS BLANKIE
IN THE DRYER

04:10.117 --> 04:11.385
AND HIS BACKUP BLANKIE.

04:11.419 --> 04:12.920
THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE ALL
RIGHT HERE.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.488
KRIS, LOOK, I KNOW THAT
IT'S HARD FOR YOU

04:14.522 --> 04:16.123
TO BE AWAY FROM HIM,
BUT I PROMISE

04:16.156 --> 04:18.792
I'LL HAVE HIM BACK HERE
IN ONE PIECE IN THREE DAYS.

04:18.826 --> 04:19.893
THREE DAYS?

04:19.927 --> 04:22.796
BUT DADDY'S APARTMENT
SMELLS WEIRD.

04:25.132 --> 04:27.067
WHEN YOU SAID YOU BOMBED,
YOU MEAN THAT, UH...

04:27.100 --> 04:31.138
I MEAN...
(imitates hiss and splat)

04:31.171 --> 04:32.840
WAS THAT THE SOUND OF A BOMB?

04:32.873 --> 04:35.976
'CAUSE YOU KINDA BOMBED
JUST DOING A BOMB.
OH, SHUT UP.

04:36.009 --> 04:39.847
OH, MY GOD! EVERYONE AT SCHOOL
IS TALKING ABOUT MOM.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.815
APPARENTLY SHE'S ON
A ONE-WOMAN CRUSADE

04:41.849 --> 04:43.851
TO DESTROY THE PLANET?

04:43.884 --> 04:46.487
THAT'S NOT TRUE. SHE'S GOT
A LOT OF PEOPLE HELPING HER.
(forced laugh)

04:46.520 --> 04:49.289
DID THEY REALLY SAY
ALL THAT STUFF TO YOUR FACE?

04:49.323 --> 04:51.024
OH, YEAH, THEY SAID IT
TO MY FACE.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.926
THEY YELLED IT AT MY CAR
AS I DROVE AWAY.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.928
THEY WROTE IT
ON THE COMMENT CARDS.
WOW.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.530
EXCEPT FOR DYLAN HERE.

04:56.564 --> 04:59.500
HE THINKS I GOT "A BANGIN'
PAIR OF GETAWAY STICKS."

05:01.168 --> 05:02.703
HEY.

05:02.736 --> 05:05.105
HELLO, EVE. ANYTHING INTERESTING
HAPPEN AT SCHOOL TODAY?

05:05.138 --> 05:06.474
(mouths words)

05:06.507 --> 05:09.377
YEAH. I GOT A B-PLUS
ON MY GEOMETRY TEST,

05:09.410 --> 05:11.111
GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH
FOR LUNCH,

05:11.144 --> 05:13.881
AND, UH, OH, YEAH,
ALL MY FRIENDS HATE MOM.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.949
COME ON, SWEETIE. I KNOW
PEER PRESSURE CAN BE HARD,

05:15.983 --> 05:17.551
BUT YOU JUST--YOU GOTTA
LEARN TO IGNORE

05:17.585 --> 05:18.819
YOUR SMART-ALECK FRIENDS.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.287
WHY SHOULD I IGNORE THEM?

05:20.320 --> 05:22.122
I THINK THEY'RE RIGHT.
WHAT YOU DO IS DISGUSTING.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.725
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY. THAT'S
YOUR MOM. SAY YOU'RE SORRY.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.159
I'M SORRY...

05:26.193 --> 05:28.962
THAT WHAT YOU DO
IS SO DISGUSTING.
(Mike) EVE!

05:28.996 --> 05:30.163
EVE, HONEY, COME ON.

05:30.197 --> 05:31.965
I'VE EXPLAINED MY JOB
TO YOU MANY TIMES.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.167
YEAH, BUT I WASN'T PAYING
ATTENTION.

05:35.202 --> 05:38.005
HONEY, HYDRAULIC FRACTURING
IS PERFECTLY SAFE

05:38.038 --> 05:39.807
WHEN IT'S DONE RIGHT,
AND I WORK HARD

05:39.840 --> 05:42.009
EVERY SINGLE DAY TO MAKE SURE
THAT IT'S DONE RIGHT.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.511
UH, I'M SORRY, MRS. B.,

05:43.544 --> 05:47.748
BUT FRACKING IS ALWAYS
POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.249
WELL...

05:49.282 --> 05:53.053
LOOK WHAT RALPH NADER
JUST HORKED UP.

05:53.086 --> 05:55.389
CARBON GASES
CAUSE CLIMATE CHANGE.

05:55.423 --> 05:58.191
THE--THE ICE CAPS ARE MELTING,
THE POLAR BEARS ARE DROWNING.

05:58.225 --> 06:02.062
WELL, MAYBE THOSE FAT CRACKER
BEARS SHOULD LEARN HOW TO SWIM.

06:03.897 --> 06:06.199
ALL I KNOW IS THAT ACTOR
MARK RUFFALO

06:06.233 --> 06:10.037
IS AGAINST FRACKING,
AND PEOPLE THAT HOT DON'T LIE.

06:10.070 --> 06:13.006
OH, MY GOD. IT'S THE GUY
THAT PLAYED THE HULK.
MM-HMM. YEAH.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.676
MAYBE WE SHOULD RESERVE JUDGMENT
TILL WE FIND OUT

06:15.709 --> 06:17.445
WHAT THOR AND SPIDER-MAN THINK.

06:19.780 --> 06:21.415
MOM, IF EVEN HALF THIS STUFF
IS TRUE,

06:21.449 --> 06:22.883
YOU HAVE TO QUIT THAT JOB.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.084
WHAT?
(Mike) STOP--ALL RIGHT,
WE'RE DONE.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.853
THE SIERRA CLUB MEETING
IS OVER, OKAY?

06:25.886 --> 06:27.087
SHE WORKS
FOR AN ENERGY COMPANY.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.423
THEY PRODUCE--WHAT IS IT
CALLED? ENERGY.

06:29.457 --> 06:33.226
THE BEST WAY TO GET ENERGY
RIGHT NOW IS OIL, COAL, AND GAS.

06:33.260 --> 06:34.862
THAT'S--
RIGHT. AND OF THOSE THREE,

06:34.895 --> 06:37.631
NATURAL GAS IS THE MOST
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY.
(Mike) EXACTLY.

06:37.665 --> 06:39.633
I THINK THE ENVIRONMENT
UN-FRIENDED NATURAL GAS

06:39.667 --> 06:41.935
AFTER IT CAUSED THAT
EARTHQUAKE IN DALLAS.

06:41.969 --> 06:44.037
OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
SO WHAT ARE THE ALTERNATIVES?

06:44.071 --> 06:45.973
UH, WHAT ABOUT SOLAR?

06:46.006 --> 06:47.107
TOO EXPENSIVE.
(Mike) MM-HMM.

06:47.140 --> 06:50.478
WIND?
IT KILLS BIRDS,
AND NOT IN THE FUN WAY.

06:52.112 --> 06:54.548
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT IT?
NO ENERGY--HOW ABOUT THAT?

06:54.582 --> 06:55.916
LET'S JUST GO OFF THE GRID.

06:55.949 --> 06:58.151
I WILL. WHO'S WITH ME?

06:58.185 --> 07:01.589
I'M WITH THE HULK.
HULK'S WITH EVE.

07:01.622 --> 07:04.792
OKAY, WELL,
YOU WON'T NEED THIS ANYMORE.
UM...

07:04.825 --> 07:06.460
NO, DAD, THAT DOESN'T
USE ENERGY.

07:06.494 --> 07:08.328
IT RUNS ON A BATTERY.

07:16.504 --> 07:20.173
YOU WANT TO TALK THE TALK,
LET'S WALK THE WALK.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.075
GOT A LITTLE BREAKER BOX...

07:22.109 --> 07:23.243
(switches click)

07:23.276 --> 07:24.344
(sighs)

07:24.377 --> 07:26.647
WELCOME TO THE 17th CENTURY,

07:26.680 --> 07:30.183
WHERE A CASE OF SMALLPOX
WAS ACTUALLY GOOD NEWS.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.653
SOMETHING HAPPENED
TO THE TV!

07:32.686 --> 07:34.121
DID WE BLOW A FUSE,
OR IS DAD DOING

07:34.154 --> 07:36.256
ONE OF HIS NUCLEAR DISASTER
DRILLS?

07:36.289 --> 07:38.959
DAD'S DARING US
TO LIVE OFF THE GRID.

07:38.992 --> 07:41.294
OKAY, I'VE HAD ENOUGH.
THAT'S IT.

07:41.328 --> 07:43.497
BY THE WAY, IF MARK RUFFALO
EVER ASKS,

07:43.531 --> 07:45.933
I HELD OUT A LOT LONGER.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.835
SO I WONDER WHAT HAPPENED

07:47.868 --> 07:50.003
TO ALL THOSE COLORFUL CARTOON
CHARACTERS...
MMM.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.371
WHO ARE ON TV.

07:51.404 --> 07:53.674
MAYBE THEY'VE GONE AWAY,
AND YOU'LL NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN.

07:53.707 --> 07:55.876
I WANT MY TV.

07:55.909 --> 07:58.111
AH, OKAY. SORRY.
I'D LOVE TO PLAY ALONG,

07:58.145 --> 08:01.281
BUT I HAVE A 5-YEAR-OLD WHO
LIKES HIS TOYS WITH BATTERIES.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.851
THEN AGAIN, WHO DOESN'T?

08:03.884 --> 08:05.152
(switches click)

08:05.185 --> 08:08.388
WAY TO STAND UP
FOR YOUR PRINCIPLES, PEOPLE.

08:08.421 --> 08:10.223
I-I THINK WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS AWFUL, MOM.

08:10.257 --> 08:11.625
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT.

08:11.659 --> 08:13.493
I'D RATHER LIVE WITHOUT POWER
THAN BE A PART OF IT.

08:13.527 --> 08:15.696
EVE, OH, COME ON.
COME ON!
I'M SERIOUS.

08:15.729 --> 08:17.164
LET HER GO.
LET HER LIVE OUTSIDE.

08:17.197 --> 08:18.732
I WILL, AND I'M NOT
COMING BACK INSIDE

08:18.766 --> 08:20.400
TILL MOM QUITS HER JOB.
YOU'RE NOT
COMING BACK INSIDE

08:20.433 --> 08:22.169
TILL YOU APOLOGIZE
TO YOUR MOM FOR SAYING THAT.

08:22.202 --> 08:23.971
HONEY, WHY DON'T WE JUST
SEND HER TO HER ROOM?

08:24.004 --> 08:26.173
OH, WITH ALL THAT
EVIL ELECTRICITY? NO WAY.

08:26.206 --> 08:29.009
THIS IS A CLASSIC CASE
OF NATURE VERSUS NURTURE.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.911
YOU JUST OFFENDED
THE NURTURER.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.946
NOW YOU CAN LIVE OUT HERE
WITH MOTHER NATURE!

08:45.392 --> 08:48.161
THIS IS A BAD IDEA, MIKE...

08:48.195 --> 08:50.397
EVE OUT THERE ALL ALONE
IN THE WILD.

08:52.966 --> 08:55.002
SHE'S NOT IN THE WILD
IF HER MOM CAN SEE HER

08:55.035 --> 08:57.337
LOOKING THROUGH
THE BEDROOM WINDOW.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.573
THIS IS LIKE WHEN KRIS RAN AWAY.
REMEMBER THAT?

08:59.607 --> 09:01.341
SHE GOT TO THE END
OF THE STREET,

09:01.374 --> 09:03.510
SHE TURNED AROUND AND RAN
RIGHT BACK HOME.

09:03.543 --> 09:06.046
SHE SHOWS NO SIGN
OF EVER LEAVING AGAIN.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.717
WE GOTTA LET EVE
SIT OUT THERE AND STEW

09:09.750 --> 09:11.585
UNTIL SHE REALIZES SHE CAN'T
TALK TO YOU LIKE THAT.

09:11.619 --> 09:13.120
OH, I JUST WISH
IT WAS SUMMER.

09:13.153 --> 09:14.521
I WANT HER TO LEARN A LESSON,

09:14.554 --> 09:17.024
BUT NOT IF SHE'S
GONNA LOSE A TOE.

09:17.057 --> 09:20.460
IT'S LIKE WE HAVE OUR OWN LITTLE
OCCUPY PROTESTER OUT THERE.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.696
OH, NOW YOU RUINED IT
FOR ME!

09:22.730 --> 09:24.297
(mouths words)

09:24.331 --> 09:25.532
LET'S JUST GET SOME SLEEP.

09:25.565 --> 09:26.867
SHE'LL BE BACK IN HERE
BEFORE MORNING.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.769
ARE YOU SURE?
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

09:28.802 --> 09:30.303
I KNOW MY DAUGHTER.

09:30.337 --> 09:33.273
AND I HID
ONE OF HER TENT POLES.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.445
SHE'LL GET ALL UPSET,
SHE TRIES TO PUT THAT THING UP.

09:41.248 --> 09:42.950
WHAT THE...

09:42.983 --> 09:44.317
WHAT?!

09:44.351 --> 09:45.919
SHE FASHIONED
A PERFECT TENT POLE

09:45.953 --> 09:48.255
OUT OF A PINE BRANCH.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.766
TOMORROW I'M GOING OUT THERE.

09:58.799 --> 10:01.534
I'M CUTTING ALL THOSE
TREES DOWN!

10:03.303 --> 10:05.438
GOOD NIGHT,
MY LITTLE PRINCE.

10:05.472 --> 10:07.274
SWEET DREAMS.
GOOD NIGHT, BOYD!

10:07.307 --> 10:08.809
NO, IT'S RYAN'S VOICEMAIL
SO HE CAN PLAY IT BACK

10:08.842 --> 10:10.243
FOR BOYD AT BEDTIME.

10:10.277 --> 10:12.512
MAMA BEAR LOVES YOU
VERY, VERY--

10:12.545 --> 10:14.915
VERY MUCH. BYE-BYE.
OKAY, WE GET IT.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.249
YOU'RE INTO THE KID. OKAY.

10:16.283 --> 10:19.119
YOU DON'T WANT TO GET ALL
SMOTHERY LIKE OUR MO--HEY, MOM.

10:19.152 --> 10:20.353
HEY.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.122
HERE YOU GO.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.291
SO BOYD'S TAKEN CARE OF.
NOW YOU AND ME,

10:24.324 --> 10:26.293
LET'S GO OUT TO A BAR...
(singsongy) AND GET CRAY-CRAY!

10:26.326 --> 10:30.330
OR WE COULD GO SEE A MOVIE!
A MOVIE?

10:30.363 --> 10:33.133
YEAH. TWO HOURS OF PEACE WHERE
EVERYBODY LEAVES ME ALONE.

10:33.166 --> 10:34.868
KRIS, YOU GO OUT TO A BAR
LOOKING LIKE THAT,

10:34.902 --> 10:37.470
AND EVERYONE WILL
LEAVE YOU ALONE.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.341
YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK
YOU'RE ENJOYING THIS.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.343
YOUR LITTLE CAMPING BUDDY
OUT THERE

10:43.376 --> 10:45.112
IS LIVING LIKE
IT'S "THE HUNGER GAMES."

10:45.145 --> 10:46.980
COME ON, BRING HER IN.
AHH.

10:47.014 --> 10:49.649
WE BRING HER IN
WITH NO APOLOGY,

10:49.683 --> 10:52.385
THAT'S--THAT'S JUST
APPEASEMENT.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.354
GOTTA LET HER TOUGH IT OUT
UNTIL SHE CAVES

10:54.387 --> 10:56.857
OR RUNS OUT OF T.P.

10:56.890 --> 10:59.192
I DIDN'T EVEN THINK OF THAT.
WHAT'S SHE BEEN DOING--

10:59.226 --> 11:00.627
WELL, IF SHE DID
WHAT I TAUGHT HER--

11:00.660 --> 11:02.395
I'LL SPARE YOU THE DETAILS--

11:02.429 --> 11:05.766
COME SPRING, YOU'RE GONNA
LOVE THOSE HYDRANGEAS.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.503
MIKE, COME ON.

11:10.537 --> 11:13.340
LOOKS LIKE IT'S GONNA BE
COLD OUT THERE TONIGHT.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.909
YEAH, IT'S GONNA SNOW, TOO.

11:15.943 --> 11:18.345
LET ME SEE IF I CAN
MOVE THIS ALONG.
THANK YOU.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.514
WHEW! IT'S COLD OUT HERE.

11:21.548 --> 11:22.983
HEY, IS THAT HOT CHOCOLATE?

11:23.016 --> 11:24.384
IT'S FIRE RETARDANT.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.386
(hisses)

11:26.419 --> 11:27.888
WHAT THE--

11:30.523 --> 11:32.926
LOOK, YOU'RE PRODUCING WAY TOO
MANY GREENHOUSE GASES OUT HERE.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.162
THERE'S SOME POLAR BEAR
SWIMMING FOR HIS LIFE

11:35.195 --> 11:36.563
UP NORTH 'CAUSE OF YOU.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.833
NO PROBLEM.
I'LL JUST PUT UP

11:39.867 --> 11:42.535
THE SMALLER BIVY SACK TENT,
GO WITH A MUMMY SLEEPING BAG

11:42.569 --> 11:45.638
AND A FLEECE FACE MASK
LIKE YOU TAUGHT ME IN YOSEMITE.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.910
I GOT THE SPRINKLERS
SET FOR 5:00 A.M.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.344
WHAT?!

11:51.378 --> 11:53.480
(door closes)

11:56.383 --> 11:58.118
THANKS FOR LETTING ME
PICK THE MOVIE.

11:58.151 --> 11:59.787
YEAH, OF COURSE.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.354
WHY WOULD WE WANT TO SEE
RYAN GOSLING

12:01.388 --> 12:02.756
TAKE HIS SHIRT OFF
WHEN WE COULD WATCH

12:02.790 --> 12:05.425
DAME JUDI DENCH
FIND LOVE IN TUSCANY?

12:06.559 --> 12:10.030
"RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK"!

12:10.063 --> 12:12.432
OH. HEY, MR. ALZATE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
HEY.

12:12.465 --> 12:14.534
HEY.
HEY! HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

12:14.567 --> 12:15.402
ARE YOU KIDDING?

12:15.435 --> 12:17.437
I WOULDN'T MISS
A JUDI DENCH MOVIE.

12:17.470 --> 12:20.440
SOMETIMES I JUST NEED
A GOOD CRY.

12:20.473 --> 12:23.410
MM. AHH! "THE BLACK PEARL"!
(chuckles)

12:23.443 --> 12:26.479
I'M 5-FOR-5 ON THE PRE-SHOW
MOVIE TRIVIA.

12:27.480 --> 12:28.782
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:28.816 --> 12:30.450
OH, JUST CALLING RYAN
TO CHECK ON BOYD.

12:30.483 --> 12:32.419
IT'LL ONLY TAKE A SECOND.

12:32.452 --> 12:33.987
(Girl) Hello. Ryan Vogelson
residence.

12:34.021 --> 12:35.222
WHO IS THIS?

12:35.255 --> 12:36.423
EMILY, THE BABYSITTER.

12:36.456 --> 12:39.793
BABYSITTER? YOU'RE
TELLING ME RYAN'S NOT THERE?

12:39.827 --> 12:42.229
THAT'S USUALLY
HOW THIS WORKS.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.264
I THINK HE WENT TO THE BAR
AROUND THE CORNER.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.899
CAN I TAKE A MESSAGE?
Yeah.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.434
YOU CAN TELL HIM THAT
WHEN I SEE HIM,

12:47.467 --> 12:49.269
I'M GONNA RIP OFF HIS FACE
LIKE A CHIMPANZEE.

12:50.971 --> 12:53.941
DID YOU HEAR THAT? RYAN
LEFT BOYD WITH A SITTER.

12:53.974 --> 12:56.576
THE WHOLE THEATER HEARD.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.645
NED BEATTY!

12:58.678 --> 13:01.448
NO, NO, I MEAN,
WARREN BEATTY!

13:01.481 --> 13:03.817
IT STILL COUNTS.

13:03.851 --> 13:05.785
WE HAVE TO GO FIND RYAN.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

13:05.819 --> 13:07.354
FIRST YOU DRAG ME
TO THIS STUPID MOVIE,

13:07.387 --> 13:08.856
YOU MAKE ME SPLIT A POPCORN--
HE'S IN A BAR.

13:08.889 --> 13:11.458
OKAY, LET'S GO.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.927
"BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE"!
(chuckles)

13:13.961 --> 13:17.097
NO, WAIT,
"LAWRENCE OF ARABIA." YEAH.

13:17.130 --> 13:20.233
IT STILL COUNTS, YOU KNOW?
HERE.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.605
HONEY, SHE'S GONNA BE FINE.

13:25.638 --> 13:26.974
I KNOW. SHE'S DOING GREAT.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.641
I'M THE ONE THAT'S HAVING
A HARD TIME WITH THIS.

13:28.675 --> 13:30.643
I'M GONNA GO OUT THERE AND TELL
HER TO COME BACK INSIDE.

13:30.677 --> 13:32.479
BABY, YOU CAN'T LET HER WIN.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.414
WE DO NOT NEGOTIATE
WITH TERRORISTS.

13:36.416 --> 13:39.052
EXCEPT THAT ONE GUY
AT THE CARPET STORE.

13:39.086 --> 13:40.487
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

13:40.520 --> 13:43.623
MY BABY'S EVER BEEN
THIS DISAPPOINTED IN ME.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.226
(door closes)

13:46.259 --> 13:48.328
CAN, UH, CAN I COME IN?

13:48.361 --> 13:50.463
DID YOU QUIT YOUR JOB YET?

13:50.497 --> 13:52.532
YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T.

13:52.565 --> 13:54.667
WELL, I'M NOT ALLOWED
IN YOUR HOUSE,

13:54.701 --> 13:56.536
THEN YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
IN MINE.

14:02.042 --> 14:05.645
FINE, BUT I CAN'T LEAVE
THIS FLAP OPEN FOR TOO LONG.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.347
WE HAVE A RACCOON.

14:07.380 --> 14:08.748
REALLY?

14:08.781 --> 14:11.018
THERE'S A LOT TO DISCOVER
LIVING IN THE YARD.

14:11.051 --> 14:13.420
THE FAMILY BEHIND US EITHER
HAS A KID WHO PLAYS OBOE,

14:13.453 --> 14:16.089
OR THEY'RE KEEPING A GOAT
AGAINST ITS WILL.

14:17.724 --> 14:21.328
WELL, CLEARLY YOU'VE BUILT
A WONDERFUL LIFE FOR YOURSELF.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.163
(mouths word)

14:23.196 --> 14:24.597
LOOK, EVE...
(clicks tongue)

14:24.631 --> 14:26.900
I KNOW AT YOUR AGE
THINGS ARE, UH,

14:26.934 --> 14:29.602
ARE EITHER RIGHT OR WRONG,
GOOD OR BAD,

14:29.636 --> 14:30.870
SICK OR JANKY...

14:30.904 --> 14:33.907
I HATE IT WHEN YOU
GOOGLE SLANG BEFORE WE TALK.

14:33.941 --> 14:35.675
NO, LET ME FI--WAIT.
LET ME FIN--LET ME FINISH.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.011
WAIT, WAIT. WAIT. THE--

14:38.045 --> 14:40.914
THE POINT I'M MAKING
IS--IS WHEN YOU'RE AN ADULT,

14:40.948 --> 14:42.782
THINGS AREN'T
SO BLACK AND WHITE.

14:42.815 --> 14:44.584
YOU HAVE TO PAY BILLS,

14:44.617 --> 14:47.087
WHICH MEANS
WE HAVE TO MAKE CHOICES,

14:47.120 --> 14:50.790
AND SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO
COMPROMISE.

14:50.823 --> 14:52.425
YOU COULD GET ANOTHER JOB.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.561
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORK
FOR A STUPID ENERGY COMPANY.

14:54.594 --> 14:57.965
I'M A GEOLOGIST,
SO IT'S EITHER THAT OR TEACH,

14:57.998 --> 15:00.467
AND AFTER BEING
IN YOUR CLASSROOM,

15:00.500 --> 15:03.436
I REALIZE HOW MUCH I DON'T
LIKE OTHER PEOPLE'S KIDS.

15:03.470 --> 15:05.705
(laughs)

15:05.738 --> 15:08.441
EVE, THE WORLD
ISN'T PERFECT,

15:08.475 --> 15:10.377
AND EVERYBODY
HAS TO COMPROMISE.

15:10.410 --> 15:13.146
I MEAN, UNLESS YOU'RE
A TRUST FUND MILLIONAIRE

15:13.180 --> 15:16.616
OR A 14-YEAR-OLD
LIVING IN A TENT.

15:18.518 --> 15:21.154
SOMEDAY
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND THAT.

15:21.188 --> 15:24.491
I JUST WISH THAT DAY WAS NOW.

15:34.201 --> 15:37.670
(out-of-tune screech and bray)

15:37.704 --> 15:40.607
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

15:40.640 --> 15:42.509
GOD...

15:48.715 --> 15:50.483
HOW'D IT GO?

15:51.551 --> 15:53.686
NOT GOOD.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.488
(taps pen)

15:55.522 --> 15:56.789
ALL RIGHT.

15:56.823 --> 15:58.825
ENOUGH OF THIS FRACKIN' AROUND.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.769
(dance music playing)

16:09.802 --> 16:12.039
BOY, MY MOUTH IS, LIKE,
SUPER PARCHED

16:12.072 --> 16:13.373
FROM THAT MOVIE POPCORN.

16:13.406 --> 16:17.144
CAN I BORROW SOME MONEY
AND YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE?

16:17.177 --> 16:18.678
NO.

16:18.711 --> 16:21.281
FINE, I'LL JUST...
STEAL A STRAW

16:21.314 --> 16:24.151
AND TROLL FOR UNATTENDED
BEVERAGES.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.122
(clears throat)

16:29.156 --> 16:31.524
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

16:31.558 --> 16:33.526
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

16:33.560 --> 16:35.662
I'M ON A DATE.

16:35.695 --> 16:37.230
WELL, SAY GOOD NIGHT,
PAY YOUR TAB,

16:37.264 --> 16:38.365
AND GO HOME TO THE CHILD

16:38.398 --> 16:40.233
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BE
TRUSTED WITH AGAIN.

16:40.267 --> 16:42.702
RYAN, LET'S GO
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

16:42.735 --> 16:44.071
THERE'S A COUPLE OF GUYS
IN HERE

16:44.104 --> 16:46.039
I DO NOT WANT TO SEE.

16:46.073 --> 16:47.874
(clears throat)

16:47.907 --> 16:49.642
KRISTIN, THIS IS
MY FRIEND EDIE.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.379
MM, CAREFUL.
I WAS HIS FRIEND, TOO.

16:52.412 --> 16:55.282
NOW I PEE A LITTLE
WHENEVER I COUGH.

16:56.116 --> 16:57.984
OH, THAT REMINDS ME.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.420
I LEFT MY BEER
IN THE STALL.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.522
(scoffs)

17:02.555 --> 17:04.324
THIS IS WHAT YOU LEFT
BOYD FOR?

17:04.357 --> 17:06.193
A DATE WITH A GIRL
NAMED V.D.?

17:06.226 --> 17:07.327
HER NAME IS EDIE.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.162
AND BOYD'S
IN REALLY GOOD HANDS.

17:09.196 --> 17:11.531
MY BABYSITTER EMILY
IS VERY RESPONSIBLE.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.166
SHE LIVES ACROSS THE HALL
FROM ME WITH HER PARENTS,

17:13.200 --> 17:15.235
A COP AND A NURSE,
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW,

17:15.268 --> 17:17.404
I DIDN'T LEAVE UNTIL
BOYD WAS SOUND ASLEEP.

17:17.437 --> 17:19.172
DID YOU DO STORY TIME?

17:19.206 --> 17:20.840
NO, I DIDN'T HAVE TO.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.176
I TOOK HIM TO THE PARK,
AND WE HAD A BLAST.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.278
HE CRASHED THE SECOND
I DROPPED HIM INTO BED.

17:25.312 --> 17:26.779
NO WARM BLANKIE?

17:26.813 --> 17:28.181
NO, NO BLANKIE.

17:28.215 --> 17:30.550
JUST A SLEEPY KID WHO CONKED OUT
'CAUSE HE HAD A BIG DAY.

17:30.583 --> 17:34.554
BUT HE NEEDS ALL THAT STUFF.
NO, HE DOESN'T. YOU DO.

17:34.587 --> 17:38.758
LOOK, I THINK THAT SOMETIMES
YOU USE BOYD AS AN EXCUSE

17:38.791 --> 17:41.128
TO NOT HAVE ANYTHING ELSE
IN YOUR LIFE.

17:44.331 --> 17:46.566
IT'S OKAY FOR US
TO HAVE FUN, KRIS.

17:46.599 --> 17:49.336
WE'RE 23, NOT 83.

17:51.171 --> 17:55.242
SO... WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH V.D.?

17:55.275 --> 17:56.243
(sighs)

17:56.276 --> 17:58.245
INTERNET DATE.

18:00.813 --> 18:02.549
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO GET RID OF HER.

18:02.582 --> 18:05.452
OHH. I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.187
HE'S GOT A 5-YEAR-OLD.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.622
LATER.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.260
THANKS.
MM-HMM.

18:13.293 --> 18:16.329
YOU GUYS, THAT OLD GUY
JUST BOUGHT ME THIS.

18:16.363 --> 18:19.566
(dance music continues)

18:19.599 --> 18:22.802
***

18:25.605 --> 18:28.007
(gruff voice) THERE SHE IS,

18:28.040 --> 18:31.444
THE ELUSIVE ROCKY MOUNTAIN
SNOW-CAPPED TEENAGER.

18:34.046 --> 18:37.884
LET'S WATCH
AS WE BAIT THE TRAP.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.696
(clears throat)

18:49.729 --> 18:51.664
(cheering on TV)
(Mike, normal voice)
ALL RIGHT.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.300
GIVE HIM SOME PROTECTION.
LET'S GO.

18:53.333 --> 18:55.202
(cheering continues)

18:55.235 --> 18:57.370
(muffled voice)
IS THAT PIZZA?!

18:59.372 --> 19:02.642
I'M SORRY. IS THAT SMELL
BOTHERING YOU?

19:11.150 --> 19:14.254
(cheering continues,
players shouting)

19:16.889 --> 19:19.359
(sighs) SECOND TOUCHDOWN
TONIGHT.

19:19.392 --> 19:20.527
YOU PROBABLY SAW
THAT FIRST ONE.

19:20.560 --> 19:23.363
OHH! WHAT AM I SAYING?

19:23.396 --> 19:26.399
THERE'S NO ELECTRICITY
IN THE TENT.

19:28.335 --> 19:30.670
HONEY, ARE YOU STAYING WARM?

19:30.703 --> 19:34.106
THERE'S ICE WHERE MY SNOT
USED TO BE!

19:35.342 --> 19:36.976
IT'S LIKE A SAUNA IN HERE.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.346
I MAY HAVE TO TURN ON
THE AIR CONDITIONER.

19:39.379 --> 19:41.248
I KNOW YOU BROUGHT
THAT TV IN HERE

19:41.281 --> 19:43.049
JUST TO TORTURE ME, DAD.
NO, I DIDN'T.

19:43.082 --> 19:45.051
YOU KNOW, I'D LIKE TO SIT
AND CHITCHAT,

19:45.084 --> 19:46.753
BUT THAT SOLAR LANTERN'S

19:46.786 --> 19:49.689
GETTING A REAL BAD
REFLECTION ON MY TV.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.263
(sighs)
(mutes TV)

19:56.296 --> 19:57.930
WHAT'S UP?
(shivers)

19:57.964 --> 20:01.401
(sighing) OH...

20:01.434 --> 20:03.035
OHH!

20:03.069 --> 20:04.937
I WANT TO MOVE BACK IN.

20:04.971 --> 20:07.206
WELL, NO ONE'S MAKING YOU
STAY OUTSIDE THERE, HONEY.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.408
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

20:10.943 --> 20:13.380
YOU WANT TO EAT HOT PIZZA,
ENJOY A FLAT-SCREEN?

20:13.413 --> 20:14.914
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ALL THIS BITCHING

20:14.947 --> 20:16.416
ABOUT WHERE ELECTRICITY
COMES FROM.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.419
(sighs) I PROMISE.

20:19.452 --> 20:20.953
AY, AY, AY...
DAD!

20:20.987 --> 20:23.290
YOUR MOM IS REALLY UPSET.

20:23.323 --> 20:25.124
I KNOW.

20:25.157 --> 20:28.395
WE TALKED ABOUT IT, AND I--
AND I FEEL REALLY BAD.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.297
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

20:30.330 --> 20:32.465
I'M GONNA APOLOGIZE.

20:32.499 --> 20:34.534
I WAS WRONG.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.369
YOU'RE NOT WRONG ABOUT
CARING ABOUT STUFF.

20:36.403 --> 20:38.104
WHAT YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT
IS PINNING ALL THIS STUFF

20:38.137 --> 20:39.539
ON YOUR MOM.

20:39.572 --> 20:42.309
I KNOW.
SHE'S FREAKIN' AWESOME.

20:43.343 --> 20:45.412
DAD, I REALLY WANT
TO WATCH THIS GAME WITH YOU.

20:45.445 --> 20:47.246
CAN YOU PAUSE IT
WHILE I TAKE A SHOWER?

20:47.280 --> 20:48.548
ALL RIGHT.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.783
BUT FIRST, BEFORE
YOU TAKE YOUR SHOWER,

20:50.817 --> 20:52.151
GO TALK TO YOUR MOM.
OKAY.

20:52.184 --> 20:54.554
ALL RIGHT?
YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:54.587 --> 20:56.589
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THAT SHOWER
AND TH TALK TO YOUR MOM?

21:06.833 --> 21:10.470
(dance music playing)

21:10.503 --> 21:12.739
***

21:12.772 --> 21:14.641
ALL RIGHT,
YOU HAVE TO TELL THAT GUY

21:14.674 --> 21:16.175
TO STOP BUYING YOU DRINKS.

21:16.208 --> 21:18.611
(singsongy)
I'M GETTING HAMMERED!

21:20.112 --> 21:22.749
SO, UH, I TAKE IT YOU'VE
NEVER SEEN RYAN DANCE BEFORE.

21:22.782 --> 21:23.983
WHY IS THAT?

21:28.388 --> 21:30.390
BECAUSE IF YOU HAD,
I WOULD NOT HAVE A NEPHEW.
