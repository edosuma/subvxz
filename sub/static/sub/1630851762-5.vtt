You know, ever since she
and my dad got divorced,

14:16.689 --> 14:19.400
she's kinda been
all over the place.

14:19.483 --> 14:21.902

a carotid doppler on her?

You know, just to make sure that
her arteries aren't narrowing

14:46.176 --> 14:47.720
'cause that can cause this.

14:47.803 --> 14:50.306
You used the perfect

14:50.389 --> 14:52.141
-No more, no less.
-What about blood thinners?

14:52.224 --> 14:54.226

'Cause she's kinda clumsy,
