WEBVTT

00:02.803 --> 00:05.606
They're totally gonna buy
house number two.

00:05.639 --> 00:07.575
I love ya --
Look at me, I do --

00:07.608 --> 00:09.810
but sometimes,
you're dumb as a potato.

00:09.843 --> 00:11.512
They're buying house number one,
no question.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.581
I got 10 bucks
that says you're wrong.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.283
Say goodbye
to your allowance.

00:15.316 --> 00:16.784
Announcer: Looks like
this beachcomber couple

00:16.817 --> 00:18.652
is gonna dig their toes
into the sand

00:18.686 --> 00:20.788
at house number...two.

00:22.290 --> 00:24.792
Are you kidding me? Emily said
she didn't want the beach house.

00:24.825 --> 00:26.327
I mean, Scott's making her
do this.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.229
I can't belie--
This is gonna ruin the marriage.

00:28.262 --> 00:30.331
I can't...

00:30.364 --> 00:31.532
When you have it,
old man.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.101
Wait a second.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.268
Is Scott wearing clogs?

00:34.302 --> 00:35.769
I feel like I hated
this guy before.

00:37.505 --> 00:38.572
Is this a repeat?

00:38.606 --> 00:42.276
Yes. I've seen it twice --
once with you.

00:42.310 --> 00:46.180
I love ya, but sometimes,
you're dumb as a potato!

00:47.548 --> 00:52.186
* I am not your ordinary guy

00:52.720 --> 00:54.422
So, you're saying,
I-I can be home,

00:54.455 --> 00:56.457
Vanessa can be at her place,
and we can play backgammon

00:56.490 --> 00:58.226
on our phones
at the same time?

00:58.259 --> 00:59.227
Yep.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.829
Wow.
Technology is cray-cray.

01:01.862 --> 01:05.266
Cray-cray indeed.
You're all set.

01:05.299 --> 01:07.067
Welcome to 2003.

01:09.603 --> 01:10.604
Okay, wait.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.473
Is this really what you're
gonna do all weekend,

01:12.506 --> 01:13.674
is just play
on your phones?

01:13.707 --> 01:14.575
Hey, his idea.

01:14.608 --> 01:16.777
Yeah, and I'm watching
the World Series.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.846
Wait.
Isn't that in October?

01:18.879 --> 01:21.582
He re-watches the
'86 World Series
over and over again,

01:21.615 --> 01:22.383
just to see the Mets win.

01:22.416 --> 01:24.652
Doesn't that get boring?

01:24.685 --> 01:25.719
No.
No, it does not.

01:25.753 --> 01:26.987
It's new to him
every time.

01:27.020 --> 01:29.357
It's like how a dog gets excited
every time its owner comes home.

01:29.390 --> 01:31.325
Hey.
It's cute.

01:31.359 --> 01:32.626
I watch it to unwind.

01:32.660 --> 01:34.862
I have
a very stressful job.
You do security.

01:34.895 --> 01:35.696
I mean, last week,
you were

01:35.729 --> 01:37.298
checking receipts
at a toy store.

01:37.331 --> 01:38.132
Yeah, that's right.

01:38.166 --> 01:40.168
I am the gatekeeper
of that place.

01:40.201 --> 01:42.336
My highlighter
doesn't hit that receipt,

01:42.370 --> 01:44.505
ain't nobody's
goin' nowheres.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.442
Hey, Kendra, you want to bring
my lady another Cosmo

01:48.476 --> 01:50.211
and some of those, uh,
zucchini sticks?

01:50.244 --> 01:51.179
You have
a girlfriend?

01:51.212 --> 01:52.846
Yeah. I mean,
haven't you guys been wondering

01:52.880 --> 01:54.748
why I haven't been around
the last six weeks?

01:54.782 --> 01:56.850
-Not really.
-Yeah, I haven't even noticed.

01:56.884 --> 01:58.686
Ah.
You know what, Vanessa?

01:58.719 --> 02:01.189
I'm sure this is
a hard pill to swallow.

02:01.222 --> 02:03.357
I always felt like you had
a little thing for me.

02:03.391 --> 02:05.759
Nope.
Never had a thing.

02:06.894 --> 02:09.630
Well, maybe not a thing thing,
but, you know, feelings.

02:09.663 --> 02:12.600
Nope.
Zero feelings.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.268
Anyway, where'd you meet her,
guy?

02:14.302 --> 02:15.469
Ah, you know,
this new dating app.

02:15.503 --> 02:18.172
It's, uh,
BeMyWingman.com.

02:18.206 --> 02:19.673
It's --
It's all the rage.

02:19.707 --> 02:20.908
Oh, is that the one
where your best friend

02:20.941 --> 02:22.042
chooses the date
for you?

02:22.075 --> 02:24.612
Yeah. My buddy Mugsy down
at the firehouse found Annie.

02:24.645 --> 02:25.913
You guys should try it.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.550
I'm sorry, but I don't need
an app to -- to find a date.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.519
Just feels
a little sweaty.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.488
Ha. Jealousy
is a terrible disease.

02:34.522 --> 02:35.489
Get well soon.

02:36.857 --> 02:38.859
I'm -- I'm not jealous.
I'm just telling you.

02:38.892 --> 02:40.861
Okay, yeah, well,
I'm here with a girl,

02:40.894 --> 02:42.463
you know,
on a nice date,

02:42.496 --> 02:43.964
and you're here watching
a spelling bee on TV.

02:43.997 --> 02:47.668
Oh, and FYI -- fat kid
with the freckles wins.

02:47.701 --> 02:50.504
Oh, come on!

02:50.538 --> 02:53.441
It's the finals.
I wait for this all year.

02:53.474 --> 02:57.245
You know, guys, that app
doesn't sound like a bad idea.

02:57.278 --> 02:59.613
I have some friends that have
tried it, and it really works.

02:59.647 --> 03:01.682
Come on. Your friends know you
better than you know yourself.

03:01.715 --> 03:04.418
I don't want
your dad picking a date for me.

03:04.452 --> 03:06.554
I mean,
a charcoal grill, maybe.

03:06.587 --> 03:08.756
A padded
shoe insert, yes.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.591
But not a soul mate.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.660
Oh, ple-- I would find you
an incredible guy.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.962
Really? Okay, you think
you could do better for me

03:14.995 --> 03:16.029
than I could do
for myself?

03:16.063 --> 03:19.567
100%, but I'm not -- I --
we don't need an app.

03:19.600 --> 03:20.834
I say we kick it
old-school.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.970
We do it face-to-face
in a bar,

03:23.003 --> 03:25.673
where you're supposed
to find love.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.675
**

03:27.708 --> 03:32.313
All right.
Mama ain't hating this.

03:32.346 --> 03:34.448
Yeah. There's some talent here.
I like it.
Yeah.

03:34.482 --> 03:35.616
Also, a lot of
wood and leather.

03:35.649 --> 03:37.785
Dig that, 'cause it's not gonna
clash with the outfit.

03:37.818 --> 03:38.819
Shamone.

03:40.488 --> 03:41.822
Let's do this.
You ready?
Okay. Yep.

03:51.365 --> 03:53.734
W-What are -- What are -- What
are you doing with your face?

03:53.767 --> 03:54.902
Just my look
from back in the day.

03:54.935 --> 03:57.805
You know, just a dangerous guy
with a lot on his mind.

03:57.838 --> 04:00.474
You keep them guessing.

04:00.508 --> 04:01.409
Okay, knock it off.

04:01.442 --> 04:03.311
You look like you're
about to pass a stone.

04:03.344 --> 04:05.713
Just act normal.
Stop it.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.048
Let's just go to the bar
and come up with a plan.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.017
So, let's get --
Easy, easy.

04:10.050 --> 04:11.652
Let's get a beer.
All right.

04:12.786 --> 04:13.754
How you doing?

04:13.787 --> 04:14.955
Good. How are you folks?
Good.

04:14.988 --> 04:16.890
I'm Dash.
Tell me about your palate.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.859
Uh, my palate
would like a beer.

04:18.892 --> 04:20.761
Two.

04:20.794 --> 04:22.630
You must think
I'm a bartender.

04:22.663 --> 04:24.498
I'm not.
I'm a mixologist.

04:24.532 --> 04:27.735
I don't serve drinks.
I invent them.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.403
Look, I-I know you probably
have to do that,

04:29.437 --> 04:31.772
but let's cut the crap
and get me a couple beers.

04:31.805 --> 04:32.906
Sure.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.308
Great. Open a tab.

04:34.342 --> 04:35.676
You got it.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.044
Oh, what about her?

04:37.077 --> 04:38.379
Thank you.
Okay.

04:38.412 --> 04:39.580
Businesswoman.
Mm-hmm.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.915
Serious all day,
comes home at night,

04:41.949 --> 04:43.351
shakes the hair out,
and it's like,

04:43.384 --> 04:44.618
"Whoa, what happened
to Margaret?"

04:44.652 --> 04:45.619
I like it.

04:45.653 --> 04:46.854
Okay.
Let's do it.

04:46.887 --> 04:49.557
All right. Now, listen, as your
wingman, I will introduce you.

04:49.590 --> 04:50.958
Okay, fine. Just so
you know, though,

04:50.991 --> 04:52.793
my -- my code word
is "Montauk."

04:52.826 --> 04:54.328
Code word?
Yeah.

04:54.362 --> 04:56.096
If I'm not into her,
I'm gonna say "Montauk"

04:56.129 --> 04:57.498
and you -- you get me
away from her.

04:57.531 --> 04:58.499
I'm not here
to break hearts.

04:58.532 --> 04:59.933
Okay, all right.
Let's do it.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.669
Hi.
Hey.

05:01.702 --> 05:02.736
Hi.
My name is Vanessa.

05:02.770 --> 05:05.606
I-I just wanted to introduce you
to my friend Kevin.

05:05.639 --> 05:06.607
Nice to see you.
Yeah.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.108
Uh, can I buy you
a drink?

05:08.141 --> 05:11.445
Excuse me? I work at
a top-three accounting firm.

05:11.479 --> 05:14.047
I don't need a man
to buy me anything.

05:14.081 --> 05:16.417
Uh, i-i-it was
just a drink.

05:16.450 --> 05:19.553
No, it isn't. It's an
expectation, a contract.

05:19.587 --> 05:22.390
It's not about a drink,
it's about power.

05:24.858 --> 05:25.693
We should probably
get going.

05:25.726 --> 05:28.596
We got a long drive
back to Montauk.

05:28.629 --> 05:29.763
Look, I wasn't gonna
come over here,

05:29.797 --> 05:31.732
but your energy
just pulled me in.

05:31.765 --> 05:34.968
I really feel like our,
uh, chakras could align.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.003
Hmm.

05:36.036 --> 05:39.139
You know, I think I left
my chakra in Montauk.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.908
**

05:40.941 --> 05:43.911
And I save a fortune
by making my own deodorant.

05:43.944 --> 05:47.381
Stings a little,
but in the end...

05:47.415 --> 05:48.682
check it out.

05:48.716 --> 05:52.453
**

05:52.486 --> 05:54.121
Montauk.

05:54.154 --> 05:55.856
Sure, I'm still part-time
at the bank,

05:55.889 --> 05:58.058
but I'm mostly focused on
my hip-hop career.

05:58.091 --> 06:00.494
Spittin' mad rhymes.

06:00.528 --> 06:02.730
Mm.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.965
Anything that rhymes
with Montauk?

06:06.967 --> 06:08.602
Sorry, yo.

06:08.636 --> 06:11.004
Thank you, Kim.
That's a very generous offer.

06:11.038 --> 06:14.875
Um, I've never seen a falcon
eat a family of mice before,

06:14.908 --> 06:19.046
but, uh, this Saturday, I
actually have plans in Montauk,

06:19.079 --> 06:20.914
so I'm not gonna
be able...

06:23.484 --> 06:26.620
What the...

06:26.654 --> 06:28.689
Montauk.

06:28.722 --> 06:31.525
A lot of people think throwing
a shot put isn't glamorous.

06:31.559 --> 06:32.626
It is.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.096
Montauk.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.501
Oh, there he is.

06:40.534 --> 06:42.503
Hey, what are you up to there,
Ky

06:42.536 --> 06:43.971
Uh, just having
a beer.

06:44.004 --> 06:46.574
Okay, well, she looks like
she's running a little low.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.476
Let me set you up.
Can we get him another one?

06:48.509 --> 06:49.643
Yeah.
Thanks.

06:49.677 --> 06:50.611
So, let me guess.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.913
You went to a bar,
you struck out miserably,

06:52.946 --> 06:54.748
and now you want help
with the dating app?

06:56.216 --> 06:59.152
Yeah. Yeah,
that's pretty much it.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.754
Look, we downloaded
the app,

07:00.788 --> 07:03.023
but we need a current member
to vouch for us.

07:03.056 --> 07:06.226
Yeah, well, I'd do it, but right
now, I'm a little "sweaty."

07:06.259 --> 07:09.196
Okay, stop being a baby. Would
you just hook us up, please?

07:09.229 --> 07:12.199
All right, fine.
But you got to say this...

07:12.232 --> 07:13.867
"Kyle,
help me find love."

07:13.901 --> 07:14.868
Okay,
that's not happening.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.203
Just say it.
No. No.

07:16.236 --> 07:17.571
He --
Why don't you say it?

07:17.605 --> 07:18.672
He didn't ask me.

07:20.207 --> 07:21.542
Okay, yeah,
you want me to say it?

07:21.575 --> 07:22.543
Or I could do this.

07:22.576 --> 07:23.744
I could tell Vanessa
a couple of the stories

07:23.777 --> 07:25.579
that nobody knows
about Kyle,

07:25.613 --> 07:27.114
like the fact that he got
his first underarm hair

07:27.147 --> 07:29.449
when he was 35,
and it came in gray.

07:31.018 --> 07:32.686
I got a lotta more.
I got --

07:32.720 --> 07:34.522
O-Okay, let's get you guys
set up, huh?

07:34.555 --> 07:35.623
There you go.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.228
No, I hear you.

07:41.261 --> 07:43.063
You know, but for me,
the crust has gotta be

07:43.096 --> 07:45.165
a little burnt
on the bottom.

07:45.198 --> 07:47.801
Yes! Exactly.
Crunchy.

07:47.835 --> 07:50.638
All right, I gotta roll.
Vanessa's here.

07:50.671 --> 07:51.972
All right, man.
I'll talk to you later, bro.

07:52.005 --> 07:53.040
Bye.

07:53.073 --> 07:56.143
You finally got through
to the Papa John's hotline?

07:56.176 --> 07:57.811
No, that was Steve.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.012
Who's Steve?

07:59.046 --> 08:00.180
Your knight
in shining armor.

08:00.213 --> 08:02.082
Huh?
I went on that dating app,

08:02.115 --> 08:04.585
and guess what --
found you the perfect guy.

08:04.618 --> 08:05.953
We went to the Knick game
last night.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.288
Wait a minute. Why would
you go out with a guy
I'm supposed to date?

08:08.321 --> 08:10.057
'Cause I wanted to make sure
he's right for you.

08:10.090 --> 08:13.927
And, man,
is he right.

08:13.961 --> 08:15.996
All right.
What are your other choices?

08:16.029 --> 08:17.230
Wait. What are you
talking about?

08:17.264 --> 08:19.633
What am I talking about? We're
supposed to have other choices.

08:19.667 --> 08:20.868
What are my
other choices?

08:20.901 --> 08:22.035
I have choices.
I have plenty of choices.

08:22.069 --> 08:23.937
Okay.
Um, yeah, all right.

08:23.971 --> 08:26.173
Well, what are they?
Okay, uh, well, there's...

08:26.206 --> 08:27.875
this guy here.
He's, uh --

08:27.908 --> 08:29.777
He's really good.
This guy's great, actually.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.144
Um, his name's George.

08:31.178 --> 08:32.212
He's a partner
at a law firm, so...

08:32.245 --> 08:33.547
Uh-huh. Sounds nice.

08:33.581 --> 08:34.615
Ooh.

08:34.648 --> 08:37.685
Uh, how -- how old are you,
uh, willing to date?

08:37.718 --> 08:39.553
Um, I don't know.
What is he

08:39.587 --> 08:41.021
Eh...

08:42.890 --> 08:43.991
60?

08:46.994 --> 08:48.562
61?

08:48.596 --> 08:50.731
He was born in '46. I don't know
how old that makes him.

08:50.764 --> 08:53.166
Oh, that's, uh...72?!

08:54.602 --> 08:56.036
My dad is 68!

08:56.069 --> 08:57.204
All right, well, then,
they're gonna get along great.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.772
Okay, come on!
All right.

08:58.806 --> 09:00.774
You are unbelievable,
man.

09:00.808 --> 09:03.611
Listen, I busted my butt
to find you somebody perfect.

09:03.644 --> 09:06.113
And I found somebody perfect
for you -- Steve.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.848
Let me just hook us up with a
meet 'n' greet, all right?

09:07.881 --> 09:08.849
We'll do it tonight.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.317
Tonight?
Yes.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.886
Oh.  All right.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.622
F-Fine.
Let's just do it.

09:14.655 --> 09:16.089
Let's do it.
And, oh!

09:16.123 --> 09:18.358
Why don't I have the girl
that I picked for you

09:18.391 --> 09:19.226
I love it, okay?

09:19.259 --> 09:20.861
And believe me,
if you don't like Steve,

09:20.894 --> 09:23.063
we'll just go with
the old guy, okay?

09:23.096 --> 09:24.297
But we got to hurry up, though,
'cause look at him.

09:24.331 --> 09:28.268
**

09:28.301 --> 09:30.771
All right, stop.
What are you doing? Stop it.

09:30.804 --> 09:31.639
I'm having some bread.
I'm hungry.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.907
No. Just wait for
Tracey and Steve.

09:33.941 --> 09:36.209
It's gonna look like
a rat got into it.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.779
Why do you
Why do you smell so weird?

09:38.812 --> 09:40.614
Oh,
I ran out of cologne,

09:40.648 --> 09:43.283
so I hit myself up
with some Febreze.

09:45.318 --> 09:48.155
Fresh Pressed Apple.
Amazing, right?

09:48.188 --> 09:50.157
How those people don't jump
into the cologne business

09:50.190 --> 09:51.725
is beyond me.

09:53.226 --> 09:54.862
Just do me a favor.
Try to act normal.

09:54.895 --> 09:56.096
All right,
don't you worry.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.898
I-I'm bringing
my "A" game, okay?

09:57.931 --> 09:58.866
Believe me, she ain't
gonna know what hit her.

09:58.899 --> 10:02.002
Uh, she will --
a big fat bucket of apples.

10:02.035 --> 10:04.705
Oh, here she is.
Tracey. Hi, honey.

10:04.738 --> 10:06.640
Hi.
Wow, she's --
she's kind of pretty.

10:06.674 --> 10:07.641
Right?
I did good, right?
Good job. Yeah.

10:07.675 --> 10:10.177
She -- She goes to church,
she likes sports,

10:10.210 --> 10:11.912
and she eats gluten.

10:11.945 --> 10:12.913
Hey. How you doing?
Hi.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.848
Hi, honey.
You look so cute.

10:14.882 --> 10:16.049
Oh, thanks.
You too.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.785
Thank you.
This is Kevin Gable.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.052
Nice to see you.
Wow.

10:19.086 --> 10:21.188
What were you talking about?
He's totally cute.

10:23.691 --> 10:24.692
What did you say?
Nothing.

10:24.725 --> 10:27.094
I just was, like, trying
to lower her expectations.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.929
Unbelievable.

10:28.962 --> 10:32.099
So, this is
the famous Enzo's, huh?

10:32.132 --> 10:34.067
Oh, yeah.
It's -- It's kinda my spot.

10:34.101 --> 10:35.268
He goes to other
restaurants, too.

10:35.302 --> 10:36.804
It's not like he's here
every day.

10:36.837 --> 10:38.205
No, I am.
I'm here every day.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.507
Trying to help you out.
Trying to help you out, bud.

10:40.540 --> 10:43.911
I get it. I go to the same bagel
place for the past 15 years.

10:43.944 --> 10:45.846
Oh.
Great little place
on Sunrise.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.681
Oh, no. Gal--
That's Galaxy Bagels?

10:47.715 --> 10:48.615
Yes!
Oh, it's --

10:48.648 --> 10:50.283
Are you kidding me?
I'm there every day.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.319
Lou, the guy who makes
the cream cheese in the back?

10:52.352 --> 10:53.854
He's on my softball team.
Love Lou.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.689
Oh, he's the best.
He's the greatest.

10:55.723 --> 10:58.191
All right, you two, break it up.

10:58.225 --> 10:59.727
Okay, well,
I-I got to go wash up.

10:59.760 --> 11:00.861
But when I come back,

11:00.894 --> 11:03.163
I'm gonna tell you how Lou
lost the tip of his thumb.

11:03.196 --> 11:05.766
Oh, that -- See, that, I need to
know. He never tells anybody.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.467
I-I tried to get him
a Christmas present once --

11:07.500 --> 11:09.169
you know, it was mittens,
to try to open him up,

11:09.202 --> 11:10.337
you know,
and talk about it --

11:10.370 --> 11:11.872
Got nothing. Nothing.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.473
Guy's -- He is ice.
-Okay, I'll be right back.

11:13.506 --> 11:16.276
All right.
This is -- That's...

11:16.309 --> 11:17.477
So?

11:17.510 --> 11:19.847
I like her.
Wow. She's great.

11:19.880 --> 11:20.914
That was a nice job.

11:20.948 --> 11:22.750
Plus, she's gonna solve
that whole thumb mystery.

11:22.783 --> 11:23.851
It's been years.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.853
Well, I'm glad, 'cause I put
a lot of thought into it.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.888
Well...
Oh. You did good.

11:27.921 --> 11:31.859
And get ready to be rewarded
because here comes Steve.

11:31.892 --> 11:33.460
Where?
Right there.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.996
The guy in the tracksuit?

11:36.029 --> 11:37.064
The one
that looks like you?

11:37.097 --> 11:38.298
Right?

11:38.331 --> 11:39.800
It's amazing, right?
Check him out.

11:39.833 --> 11:40.868
Hey, Steve-y!

11:40.901 --> 11:42.335
Oh, Kev-y!

11:45.038 --> 11:46.339
Montauk.

11:50.844 --> 11:51.544
Ooh, hey, tell 'em 'bout
the time you didn't eat

11:51.578 --> 11:52.880
before reffing
that big game.

11:52.913 --> 11:55.482
Oh!

11:55.515 --> 11:57.084
This is a great story.

11:57.117 --> 12:00.320
So, I'm supposed to referee
this NCAA tournament game,

12:00.353 --> 12:01.488
you know, in Vegas.
Mm-hmm.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.523
Okay. And my flight
gets in late,

12:03.556 --> 12:04.491
so I got to go straight
from the airport to the game.

12:04.524 --> 12:05.525
Yeah, without eating.
Yeah.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.761
And his -- And his stomach
is all like

12:09.296 --> 12:10.964
You know those noise?
I -- Yeah, I do.

12:10.998 --> 12:12.833
Yeah, yeah.
So, it's a tied score,

12:12.866 --> 12:14.968
30 seconds left, okay?

12:15.002 --> 12:18.872
And in my periff, I see a guy
selling churros, you know?

12:18.906 --> 12:20.473
-I can't look away.
-He's looking at the churros...

12:20.507 --> 12:22.009
-Mm-hmm.
-...instead of the -- the game.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.276
He's not looking at the game.
-Yep.

12:24.444 --> 12:25.378
The ref!
He's the ref.

12:25.412 --> 12:28.816
So, long story short,
I miss a traveling call,

12:28.849 --> 12:30.017
Louisville loses.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.318
I still get hate mail
to this day.

12:33.220 --> 12:34.922
-That's hysterical.
-It's amazing.

12:34.955 --> 12:37.190
It's an amazing story.
-Oh, so funny.

12:37.224 --> 12:38.992
Kevin:
I love it, man.

12:39.026 --> 12:40.393
I'm gonna --

12:42.295 --> 12:44.164
Okay, I'm gonna grab us
another pitcher.

12:44.197 --> 12:45.899
Kevin, you want to help?
It's just a pitcher.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.567
I got the last one.
You get this one.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.170
All right, fine.

12:50.203 --> 12:51.905
Excuse me.

12:51.939 --> 12:54.174
So...how's the
double date going?

12:54.207 --> 12:55.342
Horrendous.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.344
What?
Steve's a great guy.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.312
Yeah, for you.
What do you mean?

12:59.346 --> 13:00.347
You really don't get it,
do you?

13:00.380 --> 13:02.082
I get that we're all having
a good time over there

13:02.115 --> 13:03.350
and you're throwing
a wet blanket on us.

13:03.383 --> 13:08.188
Okay. I put a lot of thought
into who would be good for you.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.489
And you put
thought into

13:09.522 --> 13:11.992
who would be good
for you.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.326
Because Steve's
a good dude.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.095
No. He's you.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.064
Yeah! He's perfect.

13:17.097 --> 13:18.231
We're saying
the same thing.
No, we're not.

13:18.265 --> 13:19.532
How is she missing this?
Chale. Chale.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.334
I-If I am reading
the tea leaves correctly,

13:21.368 --> 13:24.137
I would say that Vanessa feels
as though, in picking her mate,

13:24.171 --> 13:25.505
you put your needs
ahead of hers.

13:25.538 --> 13:26.706
Thank you.

13:26.739 --> 13:29.943
How does Chale see it from
across the bar and you don't?

13:29.977 --> 13:31.544
Okay, first of all,
'cause the glasses are
thick as a brick wall.

13:31.578 --> 13:32.579
Oh, okay.

13:34.948 --> 13:37.450
If there's somebody
who's important in your life,

13:37.484 --> 13:39.486
I want to like him, too.
Is that so wrong?

13:39.519 --> 13:41.354
No, but I need
to like him.

13:41.388 --> 13:42.389
Okay.

13:42.422 --> 13:43.623
I just -- I'm sorry.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.859
I-I thought you would
like the guy, all right?

13:45.893 --> 13:47.094
But, you know,
we're here now.

13:47.127 --> 13:48.328
Let's just make
the best of it.

13:48.361 --> 13:49.997
No.
I am ending this right now.

13:50.030 --> 13:52.099
What? You can't
cause a scene, all right?

13:52.132 --> 13:53.967
You're gonna ruin things
between me and Steve.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.135
Tr-Tracey.

13:58.038 --> 14:00.507
All right, now,
this is Luigi's, okay?

14:00.540 --> 14:01.975
You compare it
with Enzo's,

14:02.009 --> 14:04.912
I think you're gonna see
which one's superior.

14:04.945 --> 14:05.913
Dad, can I just
grab a slice?

14:05.946 --> 14:07.981
Shush, shush, shush,
shush.

14:08.015 --> 14:09.182
I'm trying to concentrate,
bud, okay?

14:09.216 --> 14:11.551
Now, I like the cheese here.
The cheese looks really good.

14:11.584 --> 14:13.020
Let me get in there.

14:13.053 --> 14:15.022
Ooh, that's a nice,
crunchy bottom.

14:17.324 --> 14:19.092
Let's give it
a shot here.

14:19.126 --> 14:21.461
Oh. I'm gonna have to
take a half a point off,

14:21.494 --> 14:23.396
though,
for oil runoff.

14:23.430 --> 14:24.597
She's a little minimal.

14:24.631 --> 14:25.933
That's a good thing.

14:25.966 --> 14:27.467
Mm,
not at this level.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.002
All right.

14:29.036 --> 14:29.937
Now can I
have a slice?

14:29.970 --> 14:31.538
Jack, please, not while
I'm judging, okay?

14:31.571 --> 14:32.405
I need some silence.

14:35.976 --> 14:38.946
I'm liking the sweet notes
in the sauce.

14:38.979 --> 14:40.047
Perfect amount of garlic.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.149
This is painful. I'm just gonna
have Oreos for dinner.

14:42.182 --> 14:43.650
Sounds good.

14:43.683 --> 14:46.453
Mmm. All right.

14:46.486 --> 14:48.288
It's outstanding.
It's outstanding.

14:49.122 --> 14:50.690
I told you.
Better than Enzo's.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.625
Whoa. Easy, cowboy.

14:52.659 --> 14:54.561
Not better --
different.

14:54.594 --> 14:57.164
It's like comparing "Rocky"
and "Rocky II."

14:57.197 --> 15:00.433
Both fantastic films...
vastly different.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.002
Yeah.

15:02.035 --> 15:04.571
I hear ya.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.639
So, I can get two more tickets
to the game.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.675
Huh? Should we
bring the girls?

15:08.708 --> 15:11.979
Oh. Yeah, um, as far as
the Vanessa thing,

15:12.012 --> 15:13.046
it's, uh --
it's a no-go.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.047
I forgot to tell you.

15:14.081 --> 15:16.116
What?
Did I do something wrong?

15:16.149 --> 15:18.451
No. No, no, no. She just
wasn't -- She wasn't feeling it.

15:18.485 --> 15:20.720
Oh, well, is there anything
I could do different

15:20.753 --> 15:21.721
to change her mind?

15:21.754 --> 15:23.156
I don't think so.

15:23.190 --> 15:24.691
Not unless
we change you completely.

15:24.724 --> 15:26.626
She thought you were,
uh, too much like me.

15:26.659 --> 15:28.528
Oh.
You mean too awesome?

15:28.561 --> 15:30.430
Oh!

15:30.463 --> 15:31.931
Yeah!

15:37.337 --> 15:38.638
Wait a second.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.675
Maybe there is something
we could do.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.411
What do you mean?

15:44.444 --> 15:46.546
What if you weren't
so much like me?

15:46.579 --> 15:48.481
One sec. Kendra!

15:48.515 --> 15:50.650
Hey. What's up?

15:50.683 --> 15:53.086
I want you to give Steve
a makeover.

15:53.120 --> 15:56.023
Okay. Don't know him,
never even met him.
This won't be weird.

15:56.056 --> 15:57.390
Steve: Yeah.

15:57.424 --> 16:00.227
Y-You know, I-I-I'm not
comfortable where this is going.

16:00.260 --> 16:02.629
Just gonna take a little Kev
off the sides.

16:02.662 --> 16:05.365
Mm. I think we should take
a lot of Kev off everything.

16:09.102 --> 16:10.103
How's it going?

16:10.137 --> 16:11.171
It's going.

16:11.204 --> 16:15.175
Cool. Cool.

16:15.208 --> 16:18.178
Listen, I, uh...
Well, you know, I'm --

16:18.211 --> 16:20.080
I'm sorry about what happened
the other night,

16:20.113 --> 16:21.348
and I want you
to know that...

16:21.381 --> 16:23.283
I am looking for new guys
for you, okay?

16:23.316 --> 16:24.617
That's great.
Thank you.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.286
Has not been easy,
though.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.755
It's like...

16:28.788 --> 16:31.291
trying to find a needle
in a haystack.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.426
Funny, though,
sometimes you find a needle,

16:33.460 --> 16:36.463
and then you realize, "Ooh,
I already found that needle,"

16:36.496 --> 16:39.066
but you didn't
recognize it

16:39.099 --> 16:42.335
because the needle
looks totally different.

16:42.369 --> 16:44.371
You know what I'm saying?

16:46.506 --> 16:49.109
Okay, was that a metaphor
for something,

16:49.142 --> 16:50.277
or do you need, like,
a safety pin?

16:50.310 --> 16:53.046
I don't -- I'm not -- I don't
understand what's happening.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.814
No. I found the guy you're
supposed to be with, all right?

16:54.847 --> 16:56.349
He's standing
in the hallway.
What?! No.

16:56.383 --> 16:57.417
Right now?
Yes.

16:57.450 --> 16:58.551
Come on. I look like --
I'm wearing --

16:58.585 --> 17:00.153
No, you look great.
You look fine.

17:00.187 --> 17:02.122
And do me a favor.
Just, please, one thing.

17:02.155 --> 17:03.190
Just keep an open mind,
all right?

17:03.223 --> 17:05.225
Open mind?
Yeah, all right.

17:05.792 --> 17:08.161
Yeah.

17:08.195 --> 17:09.796
Hey, Vanessa.

17:09.829 --> 17:12.299
Steve.
No. New Steve.

17:13.633 --> 17:14.734
That's right.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.269
With all the benefits
of Old Steve,

17:16.303 --> 17:18.805
but 50% less Kevin.

17:18.838 --> 17:20.340
Well, what --
what happened?

17:20.373 --> 17:22.175
What?
Gave him a little makeover.

17:22.209 --> 17:23.610
He looks --
He looks good, right?

17:23.643 --> 17:25.145
Yeah.
He looks great.

17:25.178 --> 17:27.480
Yeah, and I picked out
his jacket, but whatevs.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.117
Look, Vanessa,
I know I --

17:30.150 --> 17:31.684
I know I blew it
the other night, you know?

17:31.718 --> 17:35.188
It's just that you're so
beautiful, and you're funny,

17:35.222 --> 17:37.390
and, uh, you know,
I got intimidated.

17:37.424 --> 17:39.526
And plus,
I droned on and on,

17:39.559 --> 17:41.594
telling all those stories
about refereeing games.

17:41.628 --> 17:44.597
No, they were --
they were...funny.

17:44.631 --> 17:46.599
Oh, come on.
You don't have to say that.

17:46.633 --> 17:50.570
But -- But she did, guy,
so just w-work with it.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.372
All right, anyway,
I was, you know --

17:52.405 --> 17:54.774
I was hoping you'd give me
a second chance, huh?

17:54.807 --> 17:56.876
And if not, I can always
go back to Men's Wearhouse

17:56.909 --> 17:58.745
and return this jacket.

17:59.779 --> 18:02.615
Then I guess you should...
keep the jacket.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.851
Nice.
All right.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.886
It was buy one jacket,
get one for a penny.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.122
That's his.
I got mine for a penny.

18:11.624 --> 18:14.594
Well, I can't get over
how different Steve looks.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.729
I know.
It's amazing, right?

18:16.763 --> 18:19.366
Old Steve cleans up pretty well,
right

18:19.399 --> 18:20.467
I knew.

18:20.500 --> 18:21.468
I changed his clothes,

18:21.501 --> 18:24.171
even deleted the word "bro"
from his vocab.

18:24.204 --> 18:25.071
Ain't that right, bro?

18:25.104 --> 18:27.507
Hey, bro, bro, bro?
You see? Nothing.

18:30.477 --> 18:31.544
Should we get
another round?

18:31.578 --> 18:33.280
Uh, yeah, yeah. I'll go --
I'll get them with you.

18:33.313 --> 18:34.681
Okay.
All right. Excuse us.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.385
Can I get another one?

18:38.418 --> 18:39.686
Seems to be going
really well, huh?

18:39.719 --> 18:41.854
Yeah, he's very sweet and funny,
but, um...

18:41.888 --> 18:43.356
But what?
I don't know.

18:43.390 --> 18:45.725
I just -- I'm not --
I'm not feeling it 100%.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.427
What exactly are you
not feeling?

18:47.460 --> 18:50.197
Well...you know, like,
little things.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.265
Like, when he eats,
he makes that sound.

18:52.299 --> 18:55.835
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

18:55.868 --> 18:57.204
I do that.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.671
Yeah, and I hate it
when you do it, too.

18:58.705 --> 19:01.241
All right, we'll fix it,
all right?

19:01.274 --> 19:02.642
W
Anything else with him?

19:02.675 --> 19:04.944
Well, it's -- You know,
it's little things.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.913
You know what? I'll make you
a list. How's that?

19:06.946 --> 19:09.249
Okay, how's --
how's it going with Tracey?

19:09.282 --> 19:11.884
Well, I mean, uh...

19:11.918 --> 19:13.320
Don't get me wrong,
it's great.

19:13.353 --> 19:14.721
You know,
she's fantastic.

19:14.754 --> 19:17.924
It's just...I'm not loving
the nurse shoes, you know?

19:17.957 --> 19:19.025
She is a nurse.

19:19.058 --> 19:22.962
Okay, let me ask you this.
Is she in the hospital now?

19:22.995 --> 19:24.697
Answer's no.

19:24.731 --> 19:25.698
I will talk to her
about it.

19:25.732 --> 19:26.933
Okay.
Okay.

19:26.966 --> 19:28.401
All right, but other than that,
we're doing pretty well, huh?

19:28.435 --> 19:29.436
Right?
Pretty good wingman.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.471
I know.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.740
Hey, listen, uh...Kev,
this might be a little weird,

19:33.773 --> 19:35.642
but we're gonna bounce,
all right?

19:35.675 --> 19:37.510
W
W-We'll bounce with you.

19:37.544 --> 19:40.613
Well, actually,
we're gonna head out alone.

19:40.647 --> 19:43.750
We were talking and
just kinda...clicked.

19:43.783 --> 19:46.419
What? W-Wait a second.
W-We clicked first.

19:46.453 --> 19:47.754
Not really.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.356
I clicked.
You didn't click back.

19:49.389 --> 19:50.690
I tried to click.
I wanted to click.

19:50.723 --> 19:52.259
Y-You didn't give me
a chance to click.
All right, stop. Stop.

19:52.292 --> 19:53.993
You gotta give me
a chance to click.
You're embarrassing yourself.
Stop.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.928
Sorry, bro.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.333
What just happened here?

20:00.367 --> 20:01.634
We just got dumped.

20:03.303 --> 20:04.971
You know what the worst part
of all of this is?

20:05.004 --> 20:06.205
Never found out what happened
to Lou's thumb.

20:16.015 --> 20:17.984
So, how's the
World Series going?

20:18.017 --> 20:20.987
The Mets are down.
They're killing me.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.355
Do have
a strong feeling

20:22.389 --> 20:23.856
they're gonna
make a comeback, though.

20:23.890 --> 20:27.026
Yeah, 'cause that's
what happens.

20:29.028 --> 20:29.996
Who's that?

20:30.029 --> 20:32.732
Well,
as your wingwoman,

20:32.765 --> 20:35.368
I got a little surprise
for you.

20:35.402 --> 20:38.004
All the way
from Galaxy Bagels...

20:38.037 --> 20:39.839
Lou?!
Mm-hmm.

20:39.872 --> 20:42.609
He's finally gonna tell you
what happened to his thumb.

20:42.642 --> 20:43.710
Really?

20:47.514 --> 20:50.750
* Don't want no sweet perfume

20:50.783 --> 20:54.387
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move *

20:54.421 --> 20:56.556
* Do, do, do, do, do

20:56.589 --> 20:57.990
* Do, do, do, do

20:58.024 --> 21:01.661
* Ohhhhhh, yeah

21:01.694 --> 21:04.731
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes *

21:04.764 --> 21:06.766
* I just don't want no...
