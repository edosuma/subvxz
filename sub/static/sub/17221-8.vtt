00:00.668 --> 00:00.801
.

00:00.834 --> 00:01.269
- HEY.
- HEY. HI.

00:02.036 --> 00:04.072
- HOW WAS
THE SHRINK'S CONVENTION?

00:04.105 --> 00:05.339
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT WAS INTERESTING.

00:05.373 --> 00:06.440
THERE'S BEEN SOME EXCITING, NEW
BREAKTHROUGHS IN THE AREAS OF--

00:06.474 --> 00:08.676
OH, YOU'RE ASKING ME
IF THEY'VE INVENTED ANY COOL,

00:08.709 --> 00:09.710
NEW PAINKILLERS.

00:09.743 --> 00:10.778
- UH-HUH.
- SADLY, NO.

00:10.811 --> 00:12.646
- OH.
[cell phone rings]

00:12.680 --> 00:13.614
- OOH.
WHO'S THAT?

00:13.647 --> 00:16.817
- EH, NO ONE.
JUST A STUPID TELEMARKETER.

00:16.850 --> 00:19.353
OH, OKAY,
SPEAKING OF SOLICITORS,

00:19.387 --> 00:21.255
CHECK OUT TEDWARD.

00:21.289 --> 00:23.057
I KNOW HIS MOVES SO WELL.

00:23.091 --> 00:25.093
FIRST, THE FRIENDLY TOUCH
TO THE SHOULDER

00:25.126 --> 00:26.560
TO ESTABLISH INTIMACY

00:26.594 --> 00:29.130
AND THEN THE HEARTFELT LAUGH.
[laughs]

00:29.163 --> 00:31.199
"I'M JUST LIKE YOU, BABY.
I'M NOT THREATENING."

00:31.232 --> 00:33.467
AND HE CLOSES
WITH THE HANDSHAKE.

00:33.501 --> 00:35.436
- THE DOUBLE-GRIP SHAKE--
SMOOTH.

00:35.469 --> 00:37.338
[cell phone rings]
- [groans]

00:37.371 --> 00:39.507
- OH, YOU'RE POPULAR.
- YEAH, NOT REALLY.

00:39.540 --> 00:40.774
WHATEVER.

00:40.808 --> 00:43.377
HEY, WHAT'S UP, PLAYER?
- WHAT'S UP, HATER?

00:43.411 --> 00:45.546
- NICE HANDSHAKE, BILL CLINTON.
- IT'S COMFORTING.

00:45.579 --> 00:48.149
LET'S THEM KNOW
THAT I FEEL THEIR PAIN.

00:48.182 --> 00:49.717
- OH, MAN. WHO IS SHE?
SHE LOOKS FAMILIAR.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.119
- SHE SHOULD LOOK FAMILIAR.

00:51.152 --> 00:52.353
THAT'S CHRIS LARSON'S
GIRLFRIEND.

00:52.386 --> 00:56.490
- OKAY, THE GUY I CONVICTED
TODAY OF BREAKING AND ENTERING?

00:56.524 --> 00:58.292
- THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S PERFECT.

00:58.326 --> 00:59.560
'CAUSE IT CAN'T GET
THAT SERIOUS.

00:59.593 --> 01:03.397
LOOK, SHE GETS A FUN FLING WITH
A NICE GUY WHILE HER MAN'S AWAY.

01:03.431 --> 01:06.134
AND IN SIX MONTHS,
FOUR WITH GOOD BEHAVIOR,

01:06.167 --> 01:08.169
HE'LL GET OUT, AND SHE'LL GO
RUNNING BACK TO HIM.

01:08.202 --> 01:10.538
NOBODY GETS HURT.
- YEAH, EXCEPT FOR YOU...

01:10.571 --> 01:13.374
BY AN EX-CON WHO'S BEEN DOING
NOTHING BUT PUMPING IRON

01:13.407 --> 01:15.509
FOR SIX MONTHS,
FOUR WITH GOOD BEHAVIOR.

01:15.543 --> 01:16.877
[cell phone rings]
OH.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.280
- OH, WHO'S KEITH?

01:19.313 --> 01:21.449
- UH...
- COME ON, WHO IS IT--

01:21.482 --> 01:24.352
SEXY SURF INSTRUCTOR,
HOT LATIN POOL BOY?

01:24.385 --> 01:26.787
I CAN TAKE IT. COME ON.
- HE CAN TAKE IT.

01:26.820 --> 01:29.623
- KEITH IS MY EX-HUSBAND.
- COOL.

01:29.657 --> 01:31.559
WAIT.
DID YOU SAY "EX-HUSBAND"?

01:31.592 --> 01:33.461
- [sighs]

01:33.494 --> 01:36.464
[upbeat music]

01:36.497 --> 01:44.338
*

01:46.507 --> 01:50.278
- IT'S A CLASSIC, AGE-OLD STORY.
TWO KIDS MEET IN COLLEGE.

01:50.311 --> 01:53.847
JOIN A BAND, FALL IN LOVE.
A DUDE IN CUTOFFS MARRIES US.

01:53.881 --> 01:57.418
HE'S A USER AND A DOUCHE BAG.
THE END.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.253
- OH, YEAH.
THAT CLASSIC, AGE-OLD STORY.

01:59.287 --> 02:01.422
[cell phone rings]
- OY!

02:01.455 --> 02:03.857
DID I MENTION HE'S AN AUSSIE?
G'DAY, G'DAY, G'DAY!

02:03.891 --> 02:05.426
UGH.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.261
- UM, TWO MORE.

02:07.295 --> 02:08.196
YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAKE IT FOUR.

02:08.229 --> 02:10.931
THIS IS DEFINITELY GONNA KEEP
HAPPENING.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.400
- I HAD THE WEIRDEST DREAM
LAST NIGHT.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.902
YOU HAD AN EX-HUSBAND
YOU NEVER TOLD ME ABOUT.

02:14.935 --> 02:16.537
NO, SERIOUSLY.

02:16.570 --> 02:17.871
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT YOU
SINCE THE BAR LAST NIGHT.

02:17.905 --> 02:19.507
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
YOU'RE OKAY.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.575
- GARY, I CAN DO EIGHT SHOTS
OF TEQUILA, NO PROBLEM.

02:21.609 --> 02:23.344
I'M AN ADULT.
I'M FINE.

02:23.377 --> 02:24.678
- NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I...
WOW.

02:24.712 --> 02:25.613
YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:25.646 --> 02:28.249
WE--WE MIGHT WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THAT TOO.

02:28.282 --> 02:29.483
UM, NO, I MEANT
ABOUT YOUR EX-HUSBAND.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.619
YOU SEEM LIKE YOU MIGHT HAVE
SOME UNRESOLVED ISSUES THERE.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.354
- NO, NO, NO, NO. NO.
OKAY.

02:33.387 --> 02:34.588
DON'T TRY TO ANALYZE ME.

02:34.622 --> 02:38.459
GARY, I SEE THE LITTLE MOUSE
ON THE WHEEL INSIDE YOUR HEAD,

02:38.492 --> 02:39.493
SPINNING AROUND.

02:39.527 --> 02:40.861
THERE'S NO CHEESE HERE,
YOU KNOW.

02:40.894 --> 02:42.796
OR IS IT SEEDS?
WHAT DO MICE EAT?

02:42.830 --> 02:43.797
I DON'T KNOW, WHATEVER.

02:43.831 --> 02:44.832
I'M FINE.
- WHAT DO I KNOW?

02:44.865 --> 02:47.468
I, DR. GARY BOYD,
BOARD CERTIFIED PSYCHIATRIST

02:47.501 --> 02:49.537

FOR MY PAPER

02:51.739 --> 02:53.374
IN THE FIELD OF MARITAL STRIFE.

02:53.407 --> 02:55.443
- WELL, APPARENTLY, NOT MUCH
IN THIS CASE.

02:55.476 --> 02:58.479
UM, I'M NOT SAYING GIVE THE
HORACE B. MANNING AWARD BACK,

02:58.512 --> 03:00.381
BUT YOU SHOULD NOT FEEL GOOD
ABOUT IT.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.916
HUH?
- OKAY.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.556
CHRIS LARSON,
YOU HAVE BEEN FOUND GUILTY

03:08.589 --> 03:10.591
OF BREAKING AND ENTERING.

03:10.624 --> 03:14.228
YOU ARE HEREBY SENTENCED
TO THREE MONTHS IN COUNTY.

03:14.262 --> 03:15.396
- GO SCREW YOURSELF!

03:15.429 --> 03:16.897
- HUH.
THAT MOTION'S DENIED.

03:16.930 --> 03:19.267
AND YOU JUST WON YOURSELF
AN EXTRA 30 DAYS.

03:19.300 --> 03:23.604
PLEASE GET MR. LARSON
OUT OF MY COURTROOM.

03:23.637 --> 03:26.640
- ANGELICA.
I AM SO, SO SORRY.

03:26.674 --> 03:28.642
TOGETHER WE CAN GET
THROUGH THIS.

03:28.676 --> 03:31.245
YOU LIKE SEAFOOD?

03:31.279 --> 03:33.681
- LIFTING WEIGHTS, TEDWARD...

03:33.714 --> 03:36.550
THAT'S ALL THEY DO.

03:36.584 --> 03:38.986
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE TAKING
A CONVICT'S GIRLFRIEND

03:39.019 --> 03:40.488
TO DINNER.

03:40.521 --> 03:41.555
- I CAN'T BELIEVE I DIDN'T THINK
OF THIS SOONER.

03:41.589 --> 03:43.924
I MEAN, FROM NOW ON,
I AM A SALMON,

03:43.957 --> 03:47.861
AND THE COURTHOUSE
IS MY SPAWNING GROUND.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.897
- G'DAY, BECKS.
YOU LOOK GOOD.

03:49.930 --> 03:52.833
- KEITH, YOU CANNOT BE HERE.
THIS IS MY PLACE OF WORK.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.702
- IT'S BEEN TEN YEARS
SINCE I LAST SAW YOU,

03:54.735 --> 03:56.003
AND YOU'RE STILL AS CUDDLY
AS RAZOR WIRE.

03:56.036 --> 03:57.705
- THIS IS KEITH?
YOU'RE KEITH?

03:57.738 --> 03:58.906
YOU NEVER TOLD ME KEITH WAS
AUSTRALIAN.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.641
LIKE, SYDNEY.
MAYBE WESTERN SUBURBS?

04:00.674 --> 04:01.942
- WESTERN SUB--
YEAH, BASICALLY.

04:01.975 --> 04:03.611
- YEAH, OKAY.
I WAS SEDUCED BY THE ACCENT TOO.

04:03.644 --> 04:05.679
- SO YOU'RE A JUDGE NOW.
CONGRATULATIONS.

04:05.713 --> 04:08.382
I GUESS YOU, UH, LEGALLY GET
TO HAVE THE LAST WORD, THEN?

04:08.416 --> 04:09.517
- WHAT DO YOU WANT, KEITH?

04:09.550 --> 04:11.619
- I TRIED TO CALL YOU.
I DID, BUT YOU WOULDN'T ANSWER.

04:11.652 --> 04:13.887
SO I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
TO DO, I JUST CAME DOWN HERE.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.589
- SO WHAT, THE ALIMONY CHECKS
HAVE STOPPED NOW?

04:15.623 --> 04:18.292
SO WHAT, YOU NEED A COUPLE GRAND
FOR A NEW AMP?

04:18.326 --> 04:20.294
- REBECCA.
I'M 43 YEARS OLD.

04:20.328 --> 04:22.062
IF I WANT A NEW AMP, I'LL JUST
SELL SOME OF MY VIDEO GAMES.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.597
- SO WHAT IS IT
THAT YOU DO WANT--

04:23.631 --> 04:24.798
THE OTHER HALF OF THE BED?

04:24.832 --> 04:26.667
YOU KNOW HE SAWED THE BED
IN HALF?

04:26.700 --> 04:29.437
OH, YEAH, YEAH, HE LITERALLY
SAWED THE BED IN HALF.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.071
- WOW.
- I WANTED TO BE FAIR.

04:31.104 --> 04:31.972
50/50, RIGHT?

04:32.005 --> 04:34.608
- EXCEPT FOR THE ALIMONY.
100/0, SO...

04:34.642 --> 04:36.844
- ISN'T THIS NICE? WE'RE PICKING
UP RIGHT WHERE WE LEFT OFF.

04:36.877 --> 04:38.712
- YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO?

04:38.746 --> 04:40.681
YOU CAN DROP IT
WHERE WE LEFT IT OR FOUND IT.

04:40.714 --> 04:43.083
HOWEVER IT GOES, OKAY?
I DON'T WANT TO PICK IT UP.

04:43.116 --> 04:43.951
YEAH.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.653
- JUDGE, DO YOU WANT ME
TO REMOVE HIM?

04:45.686 --> 04:46.887
- NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO,
'CAUSE I'M LEAVING.

04:46.920 --> 04:50.758
I'VE MOVED ON,
'CAUSE I'M AN IMPORTANT PERSON.

04:50.791 --> 04:54.395
- EDDIE MONEY DIED.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.564
- WHAT?
- EDDIE MONEY DIED?

04:56.597 --> 04:59.433
OH, LORD.
HEY, EDDIE MONEY DIED, Y'ALL!

04:59.467 --> 05:00.534
NO.

05:00.568 --> 05:03.904
- I-I MEAN, I GUESS I ALWAYS
KNEW THAT THIS DAY...

05:03.937 --> 05:06.707
WOULD COME, BUT STILL,
IT'S A SHOCK, IT'S...

05:06.740 --> 05:08.676
- THIS IS ALL REALLY HARD.
I-I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.711
I'LL NEVER HAVE HIS WARM BREATH
ON MY NECK.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.546
AND I'LL NEVER HAVE HIM
LICKING MY FACE

05:12.580 --> 05:13.747
WHEN I MAKE HIM
SLEEP WITH ME.

05:13.781 --> 05:15.783
- WOW.
YOU WERE, LIKE, A REAL FAN.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.419
- NO, EDDIE MONEY WAS OUR CAT.
- OH, OKAY.

05:18.452 --> 05:19.687
- OH, HE'S A CAT.
THAT'S EVEN WORSE.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.755
I'M SO SORRY.

05:21.789 --> 05:24.758
- I GUESS EDDIE GOT ONE TICKET
TO "PURRADISE."

05:24.792 --> 05:26.960
[chuckles]
TOO SOON?

05:26.994 --> 05:28.529
- LOOK, I JUST WANTED TO COME
AND TELL YOU

05:28.562 --> 05:29.797
THAT WE HAVE A MEMORIAL FOR HIM
AT MY PLACE TOMORROW.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.599
THE BAND'S GONNA BE THERE.

05:31.632 --> 05:35.769
WE'RE GONNA HAVE BEER, AND I'D
JUST LOVE IT IF YOU COULD COME.

05:35.803 --> 05:37.671
- I DON'T KNOW
IF I COULD MAKE IT.

05:37.705 --> 05:42.510
BUT THANK YOU
FOR LETTING ME KNOW.

05:42.543 --> 05:45.446
HEY, SAY HEY TO THE GUYS
FROM BITCH KITTEN FOR ME!

05:45.479 --> 05:47.047
- WILL DO.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.550
- THE NAME OF YOUR BAND WAS
BITCH KITTEN?

05:49.583 --> 05:51.585
- THE NAME OF MY BAND WAS
BITCH KITTEN.

05:51.619 --> 05:53.654
- AFTER THE CAT OR AFTER YOU?

05:59.960 --> 06:00.360
.

06:00.394 --> 06:01.161
- A LITTLE EDDIE MONEY.
- OH, MY GOD.

06:01.995 --> 06:04.164
THIS IS WHEN WE
DRESSED HIM UP AS YODA

06:04.197 --> 06:05.165
FOR HALLOWEEN.

06:05.198 --> 06:08.836
AND WE MADE HIM HAND OUT CANDY
WITH HIS PAWS.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.705
HE'S LIKE, GIVE YOU CANDY,
I WILL.

06:11.739 --> 06:12.973
OH, MY GOSH.

06:13.006 --> 06:15.409
AND THEN HE SCRATCHED A KID
AND THEY SUED.

06:15.443 --> 06:16.477
- YIKES.

06:16.510 --> 06:20.448
HE WAS THE SWEETEST, HUMBLEST,
KINDEST KITTY CAT

06:20.481 --> 06:21.449
THAT EVER LIVED.

06:21.482 --> 06:22.382
- HMM.

06:22.416 --> 06:24.452
I MEAN, IF THIS CAT MEANT
SO MUCH TO YOU,

06:24.485 --> 06:26.854
WHY DID KEITH GET CUSTODY?
PFFT.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.823
- GARY...
I'M A WORKING MOTHER.

06:29.857 --> 06:31.024
I MEAN, AT THE END OF THE DAY,

06:31.058 --> 06:32.726
WE HAD TO DO WHAT WAS BEST
FOR EDDIE.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.194
- SO ARE YOU GONNA GO
TO THE MEMORIAL?

06:34.227 --> 06:36.497
- I WANT TO, BUT I DON'T WANT
TO OPEN THE DOOR TO KEITH.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.799
YOU KNOW, IF HE DOESN'T SEE ME,
HE CAN'T ASK ME FOR ANYTHING.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.568
- IF YOU WANT TO GO,
YOU SHOULD GO.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.035
DON'T LET YOUR FEELINGS
FOR KEITH PREVENT YOU

06:42.069 --> 06:43.737
FROM SAYING GOOD-BYE
TO EDDIE MONEY.

06:43.771 --> 06:46.474
PLUS, KEITH DID TRACK YOU DOWN
TO TELL YOU.

06:46.507 --> 06:47.407
MAYBE HE'S CHANGED.

06:47.441 --> 06:49.176
- TRUST ME, HE HAS NOT CHANGED.
ALL RIGHT?

06:49.209 --> 06:51.211
HE WAS WEARING THE SAME
BORN IN THE USA T-SHIRT

06:51.244 --> 06:52.980
HE WAS WEARING
WHEN WE GOT MARRIED.

06:53.013 --> 06:57.017
ONLY THE "B" WAS FADED, SO IT
LOOKS LIKE PORN IN THE USA.

06:57.050 --> 06:58.552
- OH, REMEMBER MY FRIEND
NATALIE?

06:58.586 --> 06:59.620
- MM.

06:59.653 --> 07:03.190
- SHE GOT HERPES FROM
A MAX WEINBERG LOOK ALIKE.

07:03.223 --> 07:05.559
MY POINT IS, YOU SHOULD GO
TO THE MEMORIAL.

07:05.593 --> 07:08.195
- AND WHILE YOU'RE GETTING
CLOSURE WITH EDDIE MONEY,

07:08.228 --> 07:10.130
MAYBE YOU COULD GET A LITTLE
CLOSURE WITH KEITH.

07:10.163 --> 07:12.600
IN THE THERAPY BUSINESS,
THAT'S WHAT WE CALL SUPER SWEET,

07:12.633 --> 07:14.535
UNEXPECTED BONUS CLOSURE.

07:14.568 --> 07:15.903
- I WANT TO GO.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.571
I DO, YOU KNOW, BUT YOU GOTTA GO
WITH ME.

07:17.605 --> 07:18.939
I DON'T WANT TO GO ALONE.
- I CAN'T.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.608
THAT'S WHEN MY DAD'S
GIRLFRIEND'S GRADUATING

07:20.641 --> 07:21.809
FROM COLLEGE.

07:21.842 --> 07:22.943
- OH.
- YEAH.

07:22.976 --> 07:23.844
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT, GARY?

07:23.877 --> 07:25.245
ACTUALLY, I NEED TO ASK YOU
SOMETHING.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.748
- YEAH.
- I HAVE THIS RECURRING DREAM

07:27.781 --> 07:30.584
WHERE MY DAD'S TRYING TO HUG ME,

07:30.618 --> 07:33.787
BUT HIS HANDS ARE MADE
OF KNIVES.

07:33.821 --> 07:36.557
IS THAT ANYTHING?

07:36.590 --> 07:37.858
- NOPE.
YOU'RE CLEAR.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.092
- TOLD YOU.

07:41.762 --> 07:44.732
- THIS EX-CON REBOUND THING
IS NOTHING SHORT OF GLORY.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.600
SHE THINKS I'M THE WORLD'S
GREATEST GUY.

07:46.634 --> 07:48.536
- WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE HER
BOYFRIEND GOT BUSTED

07:48.569 --> 07:51.739
FOR BREAKING INTO A RADIO SHACK
DURING BUSINESS HOURS.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.507
SO THE BAR IS SET PRETTY LOW.

07:53.541 --> 07:55.543
- AND I'M SAILING RIGHT OVER IT.

07:55.576 --> 07:58.278
- WHATEVER METAPHOR YOU USE,
IT'S WRONG.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.580
- JUDGE WRIGHT.

07:59.613 --> 08:02.516
TEDWARD.
- SIR, MOO GOO GAI PAN?

08:02.550 --> 08:04.117
- CHINESE AND ME DON'T AGREE.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.520
REBECCA, I WAS JUST INFORMED
THAT YOUR CASE AGAINST

08:06.554 --> 08:08.221
CHRIS LARSON IS COMING
TO MY COURT

08:08.255 --> 08:09.757
ON EMERGENCY APPEAL.
- HMM?

08:09.790 --> 08:11.124
- SOMETHING WRONG, TEDWARD?

08:11.158 --> 08:12.259
- WRONG--NO.
NO, SIR.

08:12.292 --> 08:13.226
NOTHING'S WRONG.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.895
I JUST WANT TO SHOW MY DEEP
AND ABIDING LOVE

08:14.928 --> 08:17.130
FOR OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM.
- HUH.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.933
WELL, I WISH WHOEVER MIRANDIZED
HIM FELT AS STRONGLY AS YOU DO.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.735
APPARENTLY, THERE WAS
A TECHNICALITY, AND I HAVE

08:21.769 --> 08:23.737
TO DECIDE IF DUE PROCESS
WAS FOLLOWED.

08:23.771 --> 08:25.673
- SO LET ME JUST GET THIS
STRAIGHT.

08:25.706 --> 08:30.210
YOU'RE SAYING THAT CHRIS LARSON
COULD BE GETTING OUT SOON?

08:30.243 --> 08:31.979
- MM HMM.
- VERY SOON?

08:32.012 --> 08:33.313
- I AM.
- CHRIS LARSON?

08:33.346 --> 08:36.283
- IF HE WAS A VICTIM
OF IMPROPER CONDUCT,

08:36.316 --> 08:38.085
I WOULD RELEASE HIM TODAY
IF COULD.

08:38.118 --> 08:40.688
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT, JUSTICE
MUST BE SERVED, TEDWARD.

08:40.721 --> 08:42.255
- INDEED.

08:42.289 --> 08:45.593
- BY THE WAY, I LOVED YOUR BEARD
IN 300.

08:45.626 --> 08:46.627
- OH.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

08:46.660 --> 08:47.695
- OH!

08:47.728 --> 08:50.664
- I'M NOT TAKING IT FROM YOU
ANYMORE.

08:50.698 --> 08:53.033
GOOD DAY.

08:53.066 --> 08:55.068
- HE JUST THREW DOWN THE MIC
AND WALKED OFF STAGE.

08:55.102 --> 08:56.704
- HE'S BEEN WORKING ON THOSE
AT HOME, I CAN TELL.

08:57.805 --> 08:59.172
- LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.942
- I LOVE THAT THEY PLANTED WHEAT
IN THE FRONT YARD.

09:01.975 --> 09:03.744
- NO, NO, NO.
IT'S NOT WHEAT, JUDY.

09:03.777 --> 09:06.647
THIS IS...WEEDS.
- OH.

09:06.680 --> 09:09.016
- OH, MAN. THANK YOU FOR COMING,
BY THE WAY.

09:09.049 --> 09:09.883
- OH, IT WAS MY PLEASURE.

09:09.917 --> 09:12.252
I WAS SO SURPRISED
THAT YOU ASKED ME.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.021
- I DIDN'T.
YOU INSISTED.

09:14.054 --> 09:17.224
- YOU KNOW, ANYONE WHO WOULD
HAVE A MEMORIAL FOR A PET

09:17.257 --> 09:19.126
MUST BE A PRETTY SPECIAL GUY.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.829
I WISH I COULD FIND A GUY
LIKE THAT.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.296
- ARE YOU LOOKING TO HOOK UP
INSIDE?

09:23.330 --> 09:26.634
- PET FUNERALS ARE MY
E-HARMONY.

09:30.704 --> 09:33.707
- OH...
[soft rock in background]

09:33.741 --> 09:35.042
WOW.

09:35.075 --> 09:39.780
THIS IS LIKE WALKING INTO
A MUSEUM OF MY PAST.

09:39.813 --> 09:43.383
IT'S LIKE NOTHING HAS CHANGED
SINCE THE DAY I LEFT.

09:43.416 --> 09:46.954
THERE'S THE CURTAINS THAT WE
BORROWED...FROM THE RADISSON.

09:46.987 --> 09:50.758
AND THAT'S THE SAME LAMP THAT
WE BORROWED FROM POTTERY BARN.

09:50.791 --> 09:51.859
WE STOLE A BUNCH OF STUFF.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.226
- GOSH, OH, MY GOSH.
LOOK AT THIS.

09:53.260 --> 09:56.697
THIS IS THE-- THE FAR SIDE
CALENDAR FROM 2004.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.699
- REBECCA.
I GOT YOUR TEXT.

09:58.732 --> 10:00.200
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

10:00.233 --> 10:01.669
- IT'S FOR EDDIE.
I'M HERE FOR EDDIE, SO...

10:01.702 --> 10:02.870
- I'LL TAKE IT.
I'LL TAKE IT.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.772
- ALL RIGHT.
- AND THANK YOU FOR COMING...

10:04.805 --> 10:06.974
UM, LADY WHO OWNS CAT SWEATER.

10:07.007 --> 10:08.776
- I, UH, USED TO HAVE
MATCHING PANTS,

10:08.809 --> 10:10.744
BUT I LOST A TON OF WEIGHT.

10:10.778 --> 10:12.112
- GOOD FOR YOU.
- OH, MY GOD.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.682
- BAD ASS BECKY.
HEY, BABY.

10:14.715 --> 10:15.548
GIVE ME SOME SUGAR.

10:15.582 --> 10:18.118
[overlapping chatter,
kissing sounds]

10:18.151 --> 10:20.253
- GOD, YOU LOOK GREAT.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.022
JAMES.
- LOOK AT THIS.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.424
- OH, GOD.
- HUG THAT GUY!

10:24.457 --> 10:26.026
JUST LIKE OLD TIMES.

10:26.059 --> 10:27.895
- I CAN'T BELIEVE--
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE

10:27.928 --> 10:30.731
IT'S BEEN TEN YEARS.
WOW.

10:30.764 --> 10:34.167
- EDDIE WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY
TO SEE US ALL TOGETHER.

10:34.201 --> 10:36.269
- OH, MY GOSH.
THIS IS JUDY.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.238
- I'M SINGLE.
- NICE.

10:39.873 --> 10:43.076
- I--I--I'VE WRITTEN A FEW WORDS
IN REMEMBRANCE OF EDDIE.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.813
IT'S A POEM.
I HOPE YOU ENJOY IT.

10:45.846 --> 10:48.181
IT'S CALLED EDDIE.

10:48.215 --> 10:49.216
"E.

10:49.249 --> 10:53.086
"E IS FOR EVERY MAN DESERVES
A CAT LIKE EDDIE.

10:53.120 --> 10:58.125
"D IS FOR DAMN.
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO DIE, EDDIE?

10:58.158 --> 11:03.697
"THE SECOND D IS FOR DEAD,
'CAUSE EDDIE IS DEAD.

11:03.731 --> 11:07.034
"I IS FOR I LOVE EDDIE.

11:07.067 --> 11:12.205
AND E...IS FOR EDDIE."

11:15.508 --> 11:16.443
THANK YOU, EVERYONE, FOR COMING.

11:16.476 --> 11:17.845
IF YOU WANT ANY FOOD OR DRINKS
OR ANYTHING,

11:17.878 --> 11:18.979
IT'S ALL IN THE KITCHEN.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.148
WE'VE OPENED UP THE FRIDGE WITH
THE, UH, EUROPEAN BEERS.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.283
I THINK THAT'S WHAT EDDIE WOULD
HAVE WANTED.

11:23.316 --> 11:24.284
THANK YOU.

11:24.317 --> 11:26.486
- KEITH, THIS WAS, UH...

11:26.519 --> 11:28.722
IT WAS REALLY A BEAUTIFUL
SERVICE.

11:28.756 --> 11:30.858
THANK YOU.
I'M REALLY GLAD I CAME.

11:30.891 --> 11:33.827
- ME TOO.
HEY, UH...

11:33.861 --> 11:35.763
BECKS, WE'VE GOT THIS BIG GIG
COMING UP ON THURSDAY.

11:35.796 --> 11:37.164
THERE'S GONNA BE SOME BIG TIME
PROMOTERS THERE.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.800
IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY MUCH
AN AUDITION TO GO ON TOUR

11:39.833 --> 11:41.034
WITH LED ZEP AGAIN.

11:41.068 --> 11:41.902
- OH, WOW.

11:41.935 --> 11:44.738
THAT IS A BIG STEP UP
FOR YOU GUYS.

11:44.772 --> 11:45.973
- AMAZING, RIGHT?

11:46.006 --> 11:48.976
BUT, YOU KNOW, OUR DRUMMER HAD
TO LEAVE TOWN UNEXPECTEDLY,

11:49.009 --> 11:52.746
AND...YOU WOULDN'T BE INTERESTED
IN SITTING IN, WOULD YOU?

11:52.780 --> 11:54.882
- OH, NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

11:54.915 --> 11:58.151
I--I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOUR SET--
- OUR SET HASN'T CHANGED.

11:58.185 --> 12:00.253
- HASN'T CHANGED.
- IN TEN YEARS?

12:00.287 --> 12:01.855
REALLY?

12:01.889 --> 12:03.356
- LOOK, I HATE ASKING YOU
FOR ANY TYPE OF FAVOR.

12:03.390 --> 12:06.326
I REALLY DO, BUT YOU WOULD BE
BAILING US OUT BIG TIME.

12:06.359 --> 12:08.829
- YEAH, I--I'M NOT IN SHAPE.
I HAVEN'T PRACTICED.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.297
YOU KNOW?
- WE'LL REHEARSE.

12:10.330 --> 12:11.799
AND YOU WERE ALWAYS A BAND
FAVORITE.

12:11.832 --> 12:12.900
WHAT--WHAT DO YOU SAY?
BECKS, COME ON.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.167
- all: COME ON.
- DO IT.

12:14.201 --> 12:16.003
- DO IT FOR BITCH KITTEN.

12:23.010 --> 12:23.210
.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.144
- TOM, GLAD YOU'RE HERE.
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU

12:24.544 --> 12:25.212
ABOUT SOMETHING.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.780
I HEARD THAT CHRIS LARSON'S CASE

12:26.814 --> 12:27.848
MIGHT GET THROWN OUT

12:27.881 --> 12:29.249
ON TECHNICALITY.
- YEAH.

12:29.282 --> 12:30.517
YOU KNOW, JUDGE HERNANDEZ
IS HEARING THAT CASE,

12:30.550 --> 12:33.286
AND I DON'T THINK
HE LIKES ME SO MUCH,

12:33.320 --> 12:35.155
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT I COULD DO.

12:35.188 --> 12:36.356
- WELL, WHAT YOU MIGHT
WANT TO DO

12:36.389 --> 12:39.426
IS INVOKE RHODE ISLAND VS ENNIS,
OKAY,

12:39.459 --> 12:42.162
WHICH, IN MY OPINION,
ESTABLISHES LEGAL PRECEDENT

12:42.195 --> 12:44.497
FOR CONVICTION UNDER SIMILAR
CIRCUMSTANCES.

12:44.531 --> 12:45.899
- INTERESTING.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.400
I MEAN, I CAN LOOK--I'LL LOOK
INTO THIS.

12:47.434 --> 12:48.401
- THANK YOU, TOM.
- ALL RIGHT.

12:48.435 --> 12:49.536
- GOOD WORK.
- YEAH, THANKS.

12:49.569 --> 12:51.271
- ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU, TEDWARD.

12:51.304 --> 12:54.041
[meow]
- STOP RIGHT THERE.

12:54.074 --> 12:55.175
WHERE ARE YOU GOING, JUDY?

12:55.208 --> 12:57.444
- I'M GOING TO SEE IF
JUDGE WRIGHT'S IN HER CHAMBERS.

12:57.477 --> 12:58.511
- IS THAT A CAT?
[meow]

12:58.545 --> 13:00.447
- WELL, NOTHING HELPS EASE
THE LOSS OF A LOVED ONE

13:00.480 --> 13:02.015
MORE THAN A NEW LOVE TO TAKE
ITS PLACE.

13:02.049 --> 13:03.250
- NO, THIS SHOULD NOT BE
IN HERE.

13:03.283 --> 13:06.019
ALL RIGHT, CATS ARE DISGUSTING.
AND MEAN.

13:06.053 --> 13:09.422
AND UNLOVABLE...SO, UNLESS
IT'S A SERVICE ANIMAL.

13:09.456 --> 13:13.226
WHAT, IS THIS SOME SORT OF
SEEING-EYE CAT, JUDY?

13:13.260 --> 13:14.594
- THERE'S NO SUCH THING.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.965
[meow]
- I KNOW, THAT WAS THE PREMISE

13:17.998 --> 13:20.533
OF MY SARCASTIC COM--
WHY DO I EVEN TALK TO HER?

13:20.567 --> 13:23.170
- * AAH

13:25.572 --> 13:26.539
- YES!

13:26.573 --> 13:29.009
- YES!
YES!

13:29.042 --> 13:32.212
- YES, THAT WAS GOOD!
THAT WAS ACTUALLY GOOD!

13:32.245 --> 13:34.014
- THURSDAY'S GONNA BE RAD,
KITTENS.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.382
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
WHO WANTS DRINKS?

13:35.415 --> 13:38.618
BECKS, I GOT YOU SOME TEQUILA.
NOW, IT'S NOT TOP SHELF.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.021
BUT I DO HAVE A DEEP SUPPLY
OF FRESCA TO CUT IT WITH.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.389
- I LOVE A FRESQUERITA.

13:42.422 --> 13:43.924
YOU KNOW, I'M HAVING
SO MUCH FUN.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.425
I'M NOT EVEN MAD AT YOU
RIGHT NOW.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.326
- NICEST THING YOU'VE SAID TO ME
IN YEARS.

13:46.359 --> 13:47.961
- ALL RIGHT, I GOTTA GO TO
THE LADIES.

13:47.995 --> 13:50.497
DON'T WORRY, I BROUGHT, UM,
A BAR OF SOAP,

13:50.530 --> 13:53.166
JUST IN CASE THAT ALSO
HAS NOT CHANGED.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.202
- SMART.

13:55.235 --> 13:56.403
- OCCUPADO.
- OKAY.

13:56.436 --> 14:00.473
CALM YOURSELF, JAMES, I'VE SEEN
YOU PEE OFF A POOL TABLE.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.379
HELLO?

14:08.648 --> 14:13.286
[scratching sound]

14:13.320 --> 14:14.421
[purring]

14:14.454 --> 14:17.390
- EDDIE MONEY?
YOU'RE ALIVE?

14:17.424 --> 14:20.093
[meows, purrs]

14:20.127 --> 14:22.462
OF COURSE, YOU'RE ALIVE.
[meow]

14:27.634 --> 14:31.504
- HELLO, ANGELICA.

14:31.538 --> 14:32.539
- OH, YOU MEAN ME?

14:32.572 --> 14:35.142
[both chuckling]

14:36.443 --> 14:37.677
- I KNOW YOU SAID
THAT WE WOULD HAVE A DRINK

14:37.710 --> 14:39.546
AND THEN GO OUT TO DINNER...
- MM-HMM.

14:39.579 --> 14:43.016
- BUT FIRST,
I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU.

14:43.050 --> 14:44.918
- OH, YOU DO?
YOU HAVE A--OKAY.

14:44.952 --> 14:46.486
YOU HAVE A...WHAT KIND OF
SURPRISE?

14:46.519 --> 14:48.188
I LIKE SURPRISE--
WHO ARE THESE TWO?

14:48.221 --> 14:49.656
- TEDDY BEAR,

14:49.689 --> 14:51.524
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO MEET
MY PARENTS,

14:51.558 --> 14:54.127
DALE AND DEBBIE GONZALEZ.

14:54.161 --> 14:56.363
- [murmuring shrilly]

14:56.396 --> 14:58.365
- OKAY.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.268
OH.

15:01.301 --> 15:02.635
OH, BABE, I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS,

15:04.237 --> 15:06.974
DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
- OF COURSE YOU'RE MEETING THEM.

15:07.007 --> 15:08.241
- MM-HMM.

15:10.410 --> 15:13.346
- THEY SHOULD KNOW WHO I'M
IN LOVE WITH.

15:14.547 --> 15:16.383
- OKAY. HEY, DUDE,
HEY, SHE LOOKS--

15:16.416 --> 15:18.651
[meow]

15:18.685 --> 15:20.553

15:20.587 --> 15:22.990
WANT TO TELL ME WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON?

15:23.023 --> 15:25.025
- IT'S A MIRACLE?
- IT'S A MIRACLE.

15:25.058 --> 15:25.892
- SWEET JESUS.
- PRAISE GOD.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.228
- SHUT UP.
YOU SICKEN ME, ALL OF YOU.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.263
- [chuckles]
LET ME EXPLAIN.

15:30.297 --> 15:33.200
- YOU FAKED OUR CAT'S DEATH.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.568
WHAT, TO SOFTEN ME UP SO I'D
PLAY IN YOUR STUPID SHOW?

15:35.602 --> 15:37.570
- WOW. I DIDN'T HAVE
TO EXPLAIN ANYTHING.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.439
- YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'RE SICK.
YOU ARE SICK.

15:39.472 --> 15:42.409
- I KNOW IT'S CRAZY,
I KNOW IT'S STUPID BUT...

15:42.442 --> 15:45.112
IT'S A HUGE OPPORTUNITY
FOR THE BAND.

15:45.145 --> 15:46.679
- THE BAND!
THE BAND, THE BAND, THE BAND.

15:46.713 --> 15:48.381
IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT THE BAND
FOR YOU, KEITH.

15:48.415 --> 15:50.617
YOU'RE 43 YEARS OLD,
AND YOU'VE NEVER CHANGED.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.986
YOU NEED TO GROW UP.
OKAY?

15:53.020 --> 15:54.554
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I QUIT.

15:54.587 --> 15:55.555
- YOU CAN'T QUIT.
DON'T QUIT.

15:55.588 --> 15:56.589
- YES.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.992
AND I'M TAKING EDDIE MONEY
WITH ME.

15:59.026 --> 16:00.360
OH, YEAH.
- WHAT?

16:00.393 --> 16:03.563
COME ON, EDDIE.
YEAH.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.769
I ASKED YOU TO FIX THIS
14 YEARS AGO.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.139
- I'M WAITING ON PARTS.

16:14.541 --> 16:16.576
- HEY, TEDWARD, WE GOTTA STOP
MEETING LIKE THIS.

16:16.609 --> 16:18.011
PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO TALK.

16:18.045 --> 16:19.479
- THAT'S THE LEAST OF YOUR
PROBLEMS.

16:19.512 --> 16:22.582
YOU'RE GONNA SEND AN INNOCENT
MAN TO JAIL.

16:22.615 --> 16:23.516
- WAIT, WHAT?
NO.

16:23.550 --> 16:25.185
WHAT--WHEN?
- TODAY.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.254
CHRIS LARSON IS NOT GUILTY.

16:27.287 --> 16:29.589
- WEREN'T YOU JUST ARGUING
THE EXACT OPPOSITE THING?

16:29.622 --> 16:30.757
- LOOK, I HAD A CHANGE OF HEART

16:30.790 --> 16:33.326
THANKS TO MCNABB
VS. THE UNITED STATES.

16:33.360 --> 16:36.096
WE HAVE TO HONOR
HIS MIRANDA RIGHTS...OKAY?

16:36.129 --> 16:38.498
LOOK, IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT
SEPARATES US FROM THE ANIMALS.

16:38.531 --> 16:42.402
- WELL, WE ALSO MAKE LOVE TO OUR
MATES FACE-TO-FACE.

16:42.435 --> 16:43.703
- I'M GONNA GO.

16:43.736 --> 16:47.374
- SO YOU TOOK THE CAT?
- I TOOK THE CAT, YES.

16:47.407 --> 16:49.442
AND, WELL, THEN I ACTUALLY,
I BROUGHT HIM BACK.

16:49.476 --> 16:50.577
HE'S GOT DIABETES.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.279
HE NEEDS, LIKE, FIVE SHOTS
A DAY.

16:52.312 --> 16:53.580
I'M STILL A WORKING MOTHER.

16:53.613 --> 16:56.316
- IT'S RIDICULOUS THAT HE FAKED
A CAT'S DEATH.

16:56.349 --> 16:57.717
- MAN, HOW GOOD ARE YOU
AT THE DRUMS?

16:57.750 --> 16:59.119
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'M BETTER DRUMMING

16:59.152 --> 17:00.253
THAN YOU ARE AT SHRINKING.

17:00.287 --> 17:02.422
OH, IT'S BEEN TEN YEARS.
PEOPLE CHANGE.

17:02.455 --> 17:04.824
YOU GOTTA GET CLOSURE
ON YOUR ISSUES.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.593
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
PEOPLE DO CHANGE.

17:06.626 --> 17:07.727
- NO, THEY DON'T.

17:07.760 --> 17:08.928
I JUST HAD THE SAME FIGHT
WITH THE SAME GUY AND QUIT

17:08.961 --> 17:12.232
THE SAME BAND IN THE SAME HOUSE
THAT I DID TEN YEARS AGO.

17:12.265 --> 17:13.566
IT WAS LIKE GOING BACK IN TIME.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.468
- LOOK, I KNOW KEITH NEVER
CHANGED.

17:15.502 --> 17:17.604
BUT YOU DID.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

17:17.637 --> 17:19.572
- NO, I--I MEAN, I WOULDN'T WANT
TO HEAD SHRINK YOU.

17:19.606 --> 17:20.573
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU HATE THAT.

17:20.607 --> 17:21.708
- I DO HATE IT.

17:21.741 --> 17:24.344
I HATE THE MOUSE, THE CHEESE,
THE--OH, JUST GO AHEAD.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.812
I KNOW YOU WANT TO.

17:25.845 --> 17:27.547
- OKAY.

17:27.580 --> 17:29.382
YOU AND KEITH STARTED OFF
THE SAME.

17:29.416 --> 17:31.718
RIGHT, THE BAND MATTERED THIS
MUCH TO BOTH OF YOU, RIGHT?

17:31.751 --> 17:32.652
- YEAH,
BECAUSE I WAS 23 YEARS OLD.

17:32.685 --> 17:33.653
- W--

17:33.686 --> 17:36.556
RIGHT.
BUT THEN YOU CHANGED.

17:36.589 --> 17:37.757
REBECCA, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO GREW.

17:37.790 --> 17:40.093
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO WANTED MORE.

17:40.127 --> 17:42.162
AND THEN YOU BLAMED KEITH
WHEN HE COULDN'T KEEP UP.

17:42.195 --> 17:44.564
- OF COURSE, I DID.
HE WAS MY HUS--

17:48.301 --> 17:49.702
WOW.

17:49.736 --> 17:53.573
GARY...
YOU'RE GOOD.

17:53.606 --> 17:55.642
- I THINK YOU MEAN DR. BOYD.

17:55.675 --> 17:58.878
- JUST THINK, AFTER ALL THIS
TIME, KEITH STILL WANTS ME

17:58.911 --> 18:00.647
TO PLAY WITH HIM.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.583
YOU REALLY DO DESERVE THAT
HORACE B. MANNING AWARD.

18:03.616 --> 18:07.420
- WELL, I HOPE SO.
I ALREADY GAVE IT TO MY MOM.

18:08.855 --> 18:12.792
- REBECCA, I KNOW THIS IS
A DEEP MOMENT, BUT A SECOND AGO,

18:12.825 --> 18:14.694
YOU SAID PLAY WITH HIM.

18:14.727 --> 18:17.364
AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS
HILARIOUS.

18:22.902 --> 18:23.303
.

18:23.336 --> 18:24.337
- HEY, BAD NEWS, CAT FANCY.
EDDIE MONEY IS ALIVE.

18:26.306 --> 18:27.174
OH, HEY.
WHOA.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.409
TAKE YOUR PAL LIME DISEASE
OUT OF HERE.

18:29.442 --> 18:30.777
THIS IS UNSANITARY.

18:30.810 --> 18:33.246
- BUT SHE'S THE COURTHOUSE
KITTY.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.182
CATTICUS FINCH.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.716
- NO.

18:36.749 --> 18:37.817
- FINE.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.452
JUST LET ME FEED HER.
HERE.

18:39.486 --> 18:40.320
HOLD HER FOR A SECOND.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.355

SHE'S LIKE A VIBRATING
LITTLE MUSHY WUSH.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.876
I...OH, I THINK I HEAR
A HEARTBEAT.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.345
OH, I THINK I DO.

19:05.378 --> 19:08.415
- I'LL DROP HER CRATE OFF
IN YOUR OFFICE.

19:08.448 --> 19:10.283

19:10.317 --> 19:14.521
[whispering]

COOPERATION

19:17.457 --> 19:20.193
BETWEEN OPPOSING COUNSEL,
I FIND THAT THE DEFENDANT

19:56.529 --> 19:58.431
LOOK, SHE IS ALL YOURS.

19:58.465 --> 19:59.632
- ARE YOU NUTS?

19:59.666 --> 20:01.401
I GOT MYSELF BUSTED
TO GET AWAY FROM HER.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.436
I THOUGHT I'D BE SAFE IN JAIL.

20:03.470 --> 20:08.541
THEN SOME IDIOT GOT ME FREE AND
NOW I GOTTA MAKE A RUN FOR IT.
