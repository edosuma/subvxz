&lrm;"Dear diary, guess what?

00:31.640 --> 00:33.560
&lrm;"I nearly transformed back

00:33.720 --> 00:36.120
&lrm;"revealing my true identity to Cat Noir."

00:36.280 --> 00:38.760
&lrm;Weren't you meeting Alya after school

00:38.920 --> 00:40.800
&lrm;to research your term paper?

00:40.960 --> 00:42.800
&lrm;Oh no, I'm late... again!

&lrm;[she gasps]

01:00.960 --> 01:03.560
&lrm;-What's that noise?
&lrm;-Hide, Tikki.

&lrm;[bleeping]

01:07.880 --> 01:09.920
&lrm;[video game music]

01:10.080 --> 01:11.160
&lrm;[Kim] Come on, Max.

01:13.080 --> 01:14.320
&lrm;[Kim] Use the kitty paw.

01:16.840 --> 01:17.920
&lrm;What's going on?

01:18.080 --> 01:19.160
&lrm;[she hushes her]

01:19.320 --> 01:22.760
&lrm;Try-outs for the Paris Ultimate
&lrm;Mecha Strike 3 Tournament.

01:22.920 --> 01:26.240
&lrm;The school sends
&lrm;the 2 students with the highest scores.

01:26.400 --> 01:28.960
&lrm;Actually, the try-outs are for a partner

01:29.120 --> 01:30.360
&lrm;to team up with Max.

01:30.520 --> 01:31.520
&lrm;Why Max?

01:31.680 --> 01:33.520
&lrm;[Kim] Cus he's unbeatable.

01:33.680 --> 01:36.880
&lrm;He's got the highest APM over anyone.

01:37.040 --> 01:39.360
&lrm;-APM?
&lrm;-Actions per minute.

01:39.520 --> 01:42.720
&lrm;This tournament is his life.
&lrm;He's been grinding all year.

01:48.160 --> 01:49.880
&lrm;[bleeping]

01:50.320 --> 01:51.840
&lrm;[Miss Bustier] Adrien's in the lead.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.280
&lrm;[Kim] What happened, Max?

01:53.440 --> 01:56.760
&lrm;[cheering]

01:57.960 --> 01:59.160
&lrm;[Max sighs]

01:59.320 --> 02:01.960
&lrm;Awesome job, we'll make a killer combo.

02:02.120 --> 02:04.240
&lrm;[cheering]

02:04.400 --> 02:07.920
&lrm;Let me get this straight.
&lrm;If someone beats Max's score,

02:08.080 --> 02:10.600
&lrm;they'll team up with Adrien?

02:10.759 --> 02:13.560
&lrm;No-one can beat Max,
&lrm;or rather Max and Adrien.

02:13.720 --> 02:16.120
&lrm;It's a slam dunk, they're our dream team.

02:16.720 --> 02:17.800
&lrm;[Marinette squeals]

02:18.200 --> 02:20.880
&lrm;I see where you're going with this.

02:21.040 --> 02:24.160
&lrm;[excitedly] Just imagine...
&lrm;teaming with Adrien.

02:24.320 --> 02:25.800
&lrm;Are you insane, girl?

02:25.960 --> 02:28.400
&lrm;This is about stepping up
&lrm;and representing,

02:28.560 --> 02:30.480
&lrm;not snuggling up and snogging.

02:30.640 --> 02:32.200
&lrm;This is serious business.

02:32.360 --> 02:35.520
&lrm;Seriously, Alya,
&lrm;you think I'd go through with it?

02:36.680 --> 02:38.600
&lrm;I think we have our champions...

02:38.760 --> 02:39.960
&lrm;[Marinette] Wait!

02:40.120 --> 02:42.800
&lrm;[nervously] Is it too late to try out?

02:43.720 --> 02:46.520
&lrm;Well, the library is closing
&lrm;in 5 minutes but...

02:46.680 --> 02:47.760
&lrm;[determined sigh]

02:47.920 --> 02:49.000
&lrm;[Alya sighs]

02:49.600 --> 02:50.600
&lrm;Oh boy.

03:00.360 --> 03:02.680
&lrm;[excitedly] Adrien's joypad.

03:06.480 --> 03:08.320
&lrm;Is she serious? There's no way.

03:08.480 --> 03:11.960
&lrm;Unless the player
&lrm;has a particular motivation.

03:12.440 --> 03:15.640
&lrm;The rules are elementary.
&lrm;You battle each other's robot...

03:15.800 --> 03:19.240
&lrm;Please... Every time you win,
&lrm;you loot his items and gain XP,

03:19.400 --> 03:22.640
&lrm;which upgrades your mech'.
&lrm;I'm not a newb' thanks.

03:23.960 --> 03:28.960
&lrm;[video game music]

03:29.120 --> 03:31.880
&lrm;[he sighs] Sounds like you know enough.

03:32.040 --> 03:33.680
&lrm;Let's see if it's enough.

03:33.840 --> 03:34.680
&lrm;[Kim] This'll be fun.

03:36.360 --> 03:37.280
&lrm;[Scoffing] Seriously?

03:37.440 --> 03:40.200
&lrm;How can you spend
&lrm;so much time in front of a screen?

03:40.360 --> 03:41.760
&lrm;I know. As if.

03:42.880 --> 03:44.920
&lrm;[bleeping]

03:45.360 --> 03:47.400
&lrm;[Kim] Come on, Max. You can do it.

03:47.920 --> 03:49.840
&lrm;[bleeping]

03:52.040 --> 03:53.640
&lrm;[zapping]

03:54.040 --> 03:55.240
&lrm;[zapping]

03:58.560 --> 04:01.760
&lrm;And now, quarter circle
&lrm;plus kick and flying hyper-storm.

04:01.920 --> 04:04.840
&lrm;Triple-hit combo,
&lrm;Marinette style, boo-ya!

04:05.920 --> 04:08.680
&lrm;[Marinette cheers] I win.

04:09.360 --> 04:12.280
&lrm;What? I can't believe it.
&lrm;She... she beat him.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.080
&lrm;Beat him? She pulverised him.

04:15.240 --> 04:17.240
&lrm;The king's been knocked off his throne.

04:17.399 --> 04:18.839
&lrm;[groaning]

04:19.360 --> 04:20.600
&lrm;[cheering]

04:20.760 --> 04:22.920
&lrm;[Kim] Max, come on.

04:23.080 --> 04:24.520
&lrm;[cheering]

04:24.680 --> 04:27.880
&lrm;I accept this defeat.
&lrm;I relinquish my position.

04:28.040 --> 04:30.320
&lrm;Congratulations, Marinette,
&lrm;and Adrien.

04:31.560 --> 04:32.600
&lrm;Max, wait.

04:32.760 --> 04:34.600
&lrm;[sad music]

04:34.760 --> 04:37.200
&lrm;Look, I'm fine. I lost fair and square,

04:37.360 --> 04:40.600
&lrm;but if you don't mind,
&lrm;I'd like some solitude.

04:40.760 --> 04:44.960
&lrm;So, Marinette and Adrien
&lrm;will represent the school

04:45.120 --> 04:48.640
&lrm;at the Ultimate Mecha Strike 3 Tournament.
&lrm;Good luck.

04:49.080 --> 04:52.320
&lrm;I guess I'll be coming over to practice
&lrm;with my new partner.

04:52.760 --> 04:53.680
&lrm;See you later.

04:53.840 --> 04:55.560
&lrm;[dreamily] See... ya.

04:55.720 --> 04:57.480
&lrm;[romantic music]

04:57.640 --> 05:00.640
&lrm;You gotta win.
&lrm;You'll be representing the school,

05:00.800 --> 05:02.440
&lrm;not just hanging out with Adrien.

05:02.600 --> 05:04.080
&lrm;Adrien.

05:04.920 --> 05:05.600
&lrm;Brother.

05:05.920 --> 05:06.720
&lrm;[Max] This is a travesty,

05:07.440 --> 05:08.960
&lrm;an unequivocal travesty.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.960
&lrm;[Hawk Moth] A competition,

05:12.600 --> 05:14.880
&lrm;I know you like that, my little Akumas.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.640
&lrm;Where there's a winner, there's a loser.

05:17.800 --> 05:21.440
&lrm;[mysterious music]

05:21.600 --> 05:24.120
&lrm;[whooshing]

05:26.040 --> 05:28.920
&lrm;Fly away, my little Akuma,
&lrm;and evilise him.

05:29.080 --> 05:34.440
&lrm;[dramatic music]

05:34.600 --> 05:37.320
&lrm;I should be the one
&lrm;going to that tournament.

05:37.480 --> 05:39.040
&lrm;I worked so hard for it.

05:39.200 --> 05:40.680
&lrm;This is inconceivable.

05:41.160 --> 05:42.360
&lrm;[whooshing]

05:42.520 --> 05:45.000
&lrm;Gamer, I am Hawk Moth.

05:45.160 --> 05:47.960
&lrm;I'll help you win
&lrm;the tournament of your life,

05:48.120 --> 05:51.880
&lrm;but in return, you must help me
&lrm;achieve my high score.

05:52.280 --> 05:54.960
&lrm;Absolutely, Hawk Moth.
&lrm;Game on!

05:55.120 --> 05:58.160
&lrm;Now they'll see who's
&lrm;the greatest gamer in Paris.

05:58.560 --> 05:59.840
&lrm;[evil growling]

06:00.000 --> 06:01.640

&lrm;[he cackles]

06:09.720 --> 06:12.480
&lrm;[excitedly] Training with Adrien, Adrien!

06:12.640 --> 06:15.960
&lrm;There are other ways
&lrm;to spend time with Adrien.

06:16.120 --> 06:17.200
&lrm;What do you mean?

06:17.360 --> 06:19.920
&lrm;You know Max wanted
&lrm;to be in that tournament.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.760
&lrm;He's been training all year.

06:21.920 --> 06:24.480
&lrm;You're right.
&lrm;All I could think of was Adrien.

06:24.640 --> 06:26.600
&lrm;Hey, Adrien's coming to my house.

06:26.760 --> 06:29.400
&lrm;[gasping] Adrien's coming... to my house!

06:29.560 --> 06:31.760
&lrm;This is a total disaster. I have to...

06:31.920 --> 06:33.720
&lrm;clean my room!

06:34.960 --> 06:37.600
&lrm;[dramatic music]

06:37.920 --> 06:40.720
&lrm;That's what
&lrm;I've been trying to tell you.

06:40.880 --> 06:42.600
&lrm;All this... is not...

06:42.760 --> 06:43.760
&lrm;happening!

06:43.920 --> 06:45.280
&lrm;[dramatic music]

06:46.160 --> 06:48.760
&lrm;Calm down, Marinette,
&lrm;you still have time.

06:48.920 --> 06:50.920
&lrm;He won't show up right now.

06:51.080 --> 06:52.400
&lrm;[bell rings]

06:52.560 --> 06:53.520
&lrm;[mother] Marinette!

06:53.680 --> 06:55.480
&lrm;Someone's here to see you.

06:55.640 --> 06:57.640
&lrm;[panicking] Coming!

06:57.960 --> 06:59.520
&lrm;Marinette and I are finalists

06:59.680 --> 07:01.240
&lrm;in the Paris Ultimate
&lrm;Mecha Strike 3 tournament.

07:01.560 --> 07:02.440
&lrm;No way!

07:02.600 --> 07:06.160
&lrm;Well, she did learn from the best.
&lrm;Tom style, boo-ya!

07:06.520 --> 07:08.800
&lrm;She never told us
&lrm;about this tournament.

07:08.960 --> 07:10.160
&lrm;We were paired up today.

07:10.640 --> 07:11.960
&lrm;You two are a pair?

07:12.120 --> 07:14.760
&lrm;I'm not surprised.
&lrm;She talks a lot about you.

07:14.920 --> 07:16.000
&lrm;[Marinette] Mom!

07:16.960 --> 07:18.560
&lrm;[nervously] Come up, Adrien.

07:18.720 --> 07:20.280
&lrm;Very nice to meet you.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.120
&lrm;[romantic music]

07:22.720 --> 07:23.960
&lrm;[endearing sighs]

07:28.360 --> 07:29.960
&lrm;[woman] Bye, see you next week.

07:30.560 --> 07:32.520
&lrm;[whooshing]

07:33.960 --> 07:36.240
&lrm;Gamer, it's time to get to the next level

07:36.400 --> 07:38.160
&lrm;and show everyone who's best.

07:38.520 --> 07:39.880
&lrm;No time like the present.

07:40.200 --> 07:44.840

07:58.160 --> 07:59.520
&lrm;-Sorry,
&lrm;-No, you go.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.120
&lrm;I'LL USE THE OTHER ONE.

08:01.280 --> 08:02.600
&lrm;[nervous giggles]

08:02.760 --> 08:04.400
&lrm;[bleeping]

08:04.560 --> 08:08.320
&lrm;-Your parents seem nice.
&lrm;-Yeah, they are but sometimes...

&lrm;[she gasps]

08:10.000 --> 08:10.920
&lrm;[she shrieks]

08:11.680 --> 08:12.680
&lrm;Sometimes what?

08:12.840 --> 08:13.720
&lrm;[knocking]

08:13.880 --> 08:15.560
&lrm;Everything OK?

08:15.720 --> 08:17.760
&lrm;Just in case you were hungry...

08:18.480 --> 08:20.760
&lrm;No, thanks, we're training.

08:21.240 --> 08:24.280
&lrm;Well, maybe you can use a few tips,
&lrm;dad style.

08:24.720 --> 08:26.200
&lrm;Thanks, but no thanks.

08:26.360 --> 08:27.360
&lrm;[irritated] Papa.

08:30.080 --> 08:32.240
&lrm;Sometimes they're a little nosey.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.559
&lrm;[endearing sighs]

08:34.720 --> 08:36.159
&lrm;[nervous giggle]

08:36.320 --> 08:37.320
&lrm;Where were we?

08:39.000 --> 08:40.960
&lrm;[screaming]
&lrm;[zapping]

08:43.840 --> 08:47.040
&lrm;I'll soon be at level 2.
&lrm;My skills are indisputable.

&lrm;I am unstoppable!

08:58.120 --> 09:00.640
&lrm;[whooshing]

09:00.800 --> 09:02.640
&lrm;[dramatic music]

09:02.800 --> 09:03.720
&lrm;Excellent.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.040
&lrm;Wow! We won again thanks to you.

09:14.200 --> 09:16.680
&lrm;[nervously]
&lrm;Yeah... Yes, we did.

09:16.840 --> 09:18.920
&lrm;We? That was practically all you.

09:19.480 --> 09:21.040
&lrm;You're amazing, Marinette.

09:21.200 --> 09:24.800
&lrm;I guess you wouldn't even need me.
&lrm;I'm so lame compared to you.

09:25.800 --> 09:28.160
&lrm;[hesitantly] No, no... I...

09:28.320 --> 09:29.880
&lrm;No, you're so good.

09:30.040 --> 09:32.360
&lrm;I mean... I'm the one who's not good.

09:32.520 --> 09:35.040
&lrm;I mean... I'm lucky, that's all.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.080
&lrm;[knocking]

09:36.520 --> 09:38.960
&lrm;Anyone want cookies,
&lrm;hot from the oven?

09:39.120 --> 09:41.360
&lrm;[Adrien gasps] We're trying to work.

09:41.520 --> 09:42.480
&lrm;[he groans]

09:43.760 --> 09:45.600
&lrm;Actually, you know what?

09:46.320 --> 09:47.560
&lrm;I've got a secret.

09:48.200 --> 09:49.280
&lrm;This is why I win.

09:49.600 --> 09:50.760
&lrm;Are you messing with me?

09:51.480 --> 09:53.160
&lrm;Try playing a match with it.

09:55.400 --> 09:56.280
&lrm;[door opens]

09:56.800 --> 09:59.120
&lrm;How about a salmon and spinach pie?

09:59.280 --> 10:00.560
&lrm;Tell me what you think.

10:00.720 --> 10:01.760
&lrm;[Marinette groans]

10:01.920 --> 10:04.120
&lrm;A little snack wouldn't hurt.

10:04.280 --> 10:06.160
&lrm;[she hesitates and chuckles]

10:08.800 --> 10:09.840
&lrm;I'm really sorry.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.920
&lrm;I can't get anything done
&lrm;with my parents around.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.800
&lrm;[gulping] It's OK.

10:15.320 --> 10:17.040
&lrm;Your dad makes great pies.

10:17.200 --> 10:20.440
&lrm;[hesitating] Yeah... so shall we go back?

10:20.600 --> 10:21.640
&lrm;Let's see if it works.

10:21.800 --> 10:23.320
&lrm;[thudding]
&lrm;[screaming]

10:23.480 --> 10:25.920
&lrm;[zapping]

10:26.080 --> 10:27.280
&lrm;[screaming]

10:27.440 --> 10:29.240
&lrm;[dramatic music]

10:29.400 --> 10:31.880
&lrm;Is this a publicity stunt
&lrm;for the tournament?

10:32.040 --> 10:33.000
&lrm;[bleeping]

10:33.160 --> 10:34.200
&lrm;[gamer] Well, well...

10:34.360 --> 10:37.520
&lrm;Marinette,
&lrm;let's see who's victorious this time.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.520
&lrm;It doesn't look like it.

10:39.960 --> 10:41.000
&lrm;[whirring]

10:41.160 --> 10:41.800
&lrm;Look out!

10:43.560 --> 10:45.240
&lrm;We'd better get outta here.

10:45.680 --> 10:48.440
&lrm;[panting]
&lrm;[zapping]

10:52.600 --> 10:55.000
&lrm;[bleeping]

10:56.800 --> 10:59.200
&lrm;[panting]

10:59.840 --> 11:01.280
<i>&lrm;Game over, Marinette.</i>

11:01.440 --> 11:03.160
&lrm;How does he know my name?

11:03.320 --> 11:04.840
&lrm;Max!

11:06.160 --> 11:08.640
&lrm;He really did want
&lrm;to be in the tournament.

11:09.400 --> 11:10.760
&lrm;Time to transform.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.720
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

11:13.880 --> 11:17.640
&lrm;[lively music]

11:31.160 --> 11:32.280
&lrm;[she groans]

11:33.640 --> 11:34.440
&lrm;[whimpering]

11:35.400 --> 11:36.480
&lrm;Game over.

11:37.240 --> 11:39.840
&lrm;Not yet.
&lrm;Here comes a new challenger.

11:42.920 --> 11:44.600
&lrm;Cat Noir, hey!

11:44.760 --> 11:45.760
&lrm;Over here!

11:48.240 --> 11:49.280
&lrm;[she gasps]

11:49.440 --> 11:54.520
&lrm;[panting]

11:59.040 --> 12:02.440
&lrm;I heard you
&lrm;really ticked off the final boss.

12:02.600 --> 12:06.160
&lrm;It doesn't give him extra
&lrm;points to transform everyone.

12:06.320 --> 12:08.600
&lrm;Wait, I left Adrien at the park.

12:08.760 --> 12:10.280
&lrm;We have to go back.

12:10.920 --> 12:13.720
&lrm;[he hesitates]
&lrm;Don't worry, he's not in danger.

12:13.880 --> 12:16.240
&lrm;He'll be fine. You'll be safe here.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.240
&lrm;I'll take care of everything.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.400
&lrm;Arch, leap and do a barrel-roll.

12:21.120 --> 12:22.960
&lrm;He's always so over the top.

12:23.120 --> 12:26.040
&lrm;If ever there was a game to win,
&lrm;this is it.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.520
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

12:32.040 --> 12:34.240
&lrm;[lively music]

12:34.400 --> 12:42.840
&lrm;[lively music continues]

12:43.920 --> 12:49.800
&lrm;[whirring]

12:50.520 --> 12:54.040
&lrm;[dramatic music]

12:54.200 --> 12:57.320
&lrm;[panting]

12:58.080 --> 13:00.120
&lrm;Get away from here, as far as you can!

13:01.920 --> 13:03.080
&lrm;[screams] Hurry!

13:03.240 --> 13:05.920
&lrm;[Cat Noir] Hey, tin can, over here!

13:06.080 --> 13:09.680
&lrm;My calculations indicate
&lrm;that your system's about to crash.

13:09.840 --> 13:11.320
&lrm;[she yells]

13:11.480 --> 13:12.840
&lrm;[whizzing]

13:13.000 --> 13:14.280
&lrm;[gamer groans]

13:14.440 --> 13:16.640
&lrm;You're the one crashing, robot.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.040
&lrm;[he yells]

13:23.360 --> 13:25.760
&lrm;He's a robot from Ultimate Mecha Strike.

13:25.920 --> 13:30.040
&lrm;I know. And it's nearly at level 3,
&lrm;4 is the highest.

13:30.200 --> 13:32.880
&lrm;-Wait, you know that game?
&lrm;-Of course.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.280
&lrm;See? You and me, it was meant to be.

13:35.440 --> 13:36.120
&lrm;[she sighs]

13:38.440 --> 13:39.440
&lrm;[cackling]

13:39.600 --> 13:41.320
&lrm;[zapping]

13:41.480 --> 13:43.440
&lrm;[bleeping]

13:43.600 --> 13:49.040
&lrm;[whirring]
&lrm;[whooshing]

13:50.360 --> 13:53.320
&lrm;I think our problem got
&lrm;a whole lot bigger.

13:53.840 --> 13:55.200
&lrm;[cheerfully] Level 3.

13:55.360 --> 13:57.040
&lrm;[he cackles]

13:57.560 --> 14:00.240
&lrm;If you want to be the most
&lrm;powerful robot,

14:00.400 --> 14:03.720
&lrm;you must capture Ladybug
&lrm;and Cat Noir's Miraculouses.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.560
&lrm;Then it really will be game over.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.080
&lrm;Those Miraculouses are mine.

14:10.360 --> 14:12.560
&lrm;[dramatic music]

14:12.720 --> 14:14.000
&lrm;[zapping]

14:14.160 --> 14:15.160
&lrm;[panting]

14:15.320 --> 14:16.400
&lrm;[whizzing]

14:16.560 --> 14:17.600
&lrm;[zapping]

14:18.040 --> 14:20.720
&lrm;We have to stop him
&lrm;before he destroys Paris.

14:24.880 --> 14:25.920
&lrm;THE STADIUM!

14:26.560 --> 14:27.840
&lrm;[whizzing]

14:32.880 --> 14:34.440
&lrm;[lively music]

14:34.600 --> 14:35.920
&lrm;Where's Clunky got to?

14:36.560 --> 14:37.560
&lrm;[thud]

14:39.000 --> 14:39.840
&lrm;[they yell]

14:42.040 --> 14:43.000
&lrm;[he cackles]

14:45.800 --> 14:47.200
&lrm;[zapping]

14:47.360 --> 14:49.440
&lrm;Attack him with your Cataclysm power,

14:49.600 --> 14:51.040
&lrm;It might shock him.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.640
&lrm;My pleasure. Two can play this game.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.280
&lrm;Cataclysm!

14:56.440 --> 15:00.600
&lrm;[lively music]

15:01.280 --> 15:02.680
&lrm;[he yells]

15:03.080 --> 15:04.120
&lrm;[whooshing]

15:04.840 --> 15:06.560
&lrm;[agonising cry] No!

15:06.920 --> 15:07.680
&lrm;[groaning]

15:08.680 --> 15:10.160
&lrm;Smack-down, Cat Noir.

15:10.320 --> 15:12.520
&lrm;Cat Noir style, boo-ya!

15:12.680 --> 15:14.520
&lrm;[whooshing]

15:17.640 --> 15:18.880
&lrm;Check out that loot!

15:19.040 --> 15:20.240
&lrm;System crash, Gamer!

15:20.400 --> 15:22.920
&lrm;[he cackles]
&lrm;You've forgotten the rules.

15:23.320 --> 15:25.200
&lrm;I saved my last level.

15:25.680 --> 15:29.000
&lrm;[whooshing]

15:29.160 --> 15:30.320
&lrm;[Ladybug sighs]

15:30.480 --> 15:31.600
&lrm;Re-spawn!

15:31.760 --> 15:34.120
&lrm;Not the old spawn point glitch again.

15:34.280 --> 15:38.200
&lrm;Did you see him press his glasses?
&lrm;I bet the Akuma's in there.

15:38.360 --> 15:42.680
&lrm;[whooshing]

15:43.600 --> 15:45.680
&lrm;[Marinette] We've levelled up too.

15:46.120 --> 15:47.920
&lrm;I don't have long left.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.920
&lrm;[lively music]

15:50.080 --> 15:51.520
&lrm;I'll man it, you shoot.

15:51.680 --> 15:54.240
&lrm;-Why do you get to man it?
&lrm;-Wanna flip for it?

15:54.800 --> 15:56.440
&lrm;[whirring]

15:57.080 --> 15:59.080
&lrm;[crashing]

15:59.480 --> 16:01.120
&lrm;OK, you man it, I'll fire.

16:01.280 --> 16:02.800
&lrm;Look out. Here he comes.

16:02.960 --> 16:05.680
&lrm;[smashing]
&lrm;[fizzing]

16:07.600 --> 16:09.080
&lrm;Don't let it go to your head.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.040
&lrm;Hawk booster!

16:12.880 --> 16:13.760
&lrm;[worried cry]

16:17.400 --> 16:18.680
&lrm;[he cackles]

16:19.200 --> 16:21.680
&lrm;[lively music]

16:21.840 --> 16:23.280
&lrm;Round 2, Gamer.

16:23.440 --> 16:24.240
&lrm;[he growls]

16:24.800 --> 16:26.720
&lrm;Pyramissiles!

16:27.600 --> 16:28.880
&lrm;Force-field, Cat Noir!

16:29.040 --> 16:31.480
&lrm;Got it! Force-field activated.

16:31.840 --> 16:33.920
&lrm;[rumbling]

16:36.360 --> 16:37.600
&lrm;Catsabre.

16:38.440 --> 16:40.640
&lrm;[lively music]

16:41.120 --> 16:42.400
&lrm;Pyradrill!

16:55.480 --> 16:56.320
&lrm;[fizzing]

16:56.680 --> 16:59.120
&lrm;He's powerful.
&lrm;He took out our force-field.

16:59.280 --> 17:00.280
&lrm;We'll have to do without.

17:00.560 --> 17:01.560
&lrm;Ladybombs!

17:01.960 --> 17:02.840
&lrm;Laser wall!

&lrm;[Cat Noir] Kitty-punch!

17:14.599 --> 17:15.800
&lrm;[bombs whistle]

17:16.960 --> 17:18.160
&lrm;[Cat Noir] Ear thunder!

17:18.560 --> 17:20.079
&lrm;[zapping]

17:20.680 --> 17:23.400
&lrm;-He's anticipating our attacks.
&lrm;-Watch out!

17:39.000 --> 17:40.160
&lrm;[he cackles]

17:40.320 --> 17:41.800
&lrm;Today, I'll be victorious.

17:42.440 --> 17:43.960

17:51.080 --> 17:52.760

17:54.800 --> 17:57.000
&lrm;I am the strongest player in the world.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.160
&lrm;[cackling]

17:58.480 --> 18:00.800
&lrm;How do we beat him
&lrm;if we can't catch him?

18:00.960 --> 18:02.800
&lrm;We have to jam the system.

18:03.440 --> 18:04.920
&lrm;Tatsukitty!

&lrm;Catoukin!

18:19.920 --> 18:21.320
&lrm;We must get inside.

18:21.480 --> 18:22.680
&lrm;Go. You're boss.

18:23.080 --> 18:24.960
&lrm;Take control, I'll be right back.

18:25.120 --> 18:26.800
&lrm;Right back? Where you going?

18:26.960 --> 18:28.400
&lrm;It's just us two, Gamer.

18:28.560 --> 18:29.280
&lrm;What...?

18:29.920 --> 18:31.600
&lrm;Lucky charm!

18:31.760 --> 18:34.760
&lrm;[lively music]

18:36.640 --> 18:39.040
&lrm;Graffiti? Spray-paint? Arts and crafts?

18:43.680 --> 18:45.600

&lrm;You won't get away with this.

18:58.800 --> 19:00.120
&lrm;[rumbling]

19:00.560 --> 19:02.200
&lrm;Game over, Gamer.

19:04.280 --> 19:06.200
&lrm;Game over for you too, Akuma.

19:06.680 --> 19:09.720
&lrm;[lively music]

19:09.880 --> 19:12.080
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

19:15.240 --> 19:16.240
&lrm;Gotcha!

19:17.760 --> 19:19.520
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

19:19.920 --> 19:21.560
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

19:25.240 --> 19:26.720
&lrm;[sighs of relief]

19:26.880 --> 19:28.600
&lrm;[whooshing]

19:30.640 --> 19:31.960
&lrm;What am I doing here?

19:32.120 --> 19:33.200
&lrm;POUND IT!

19:33.360 --> 19:35.840
&lrm;Such pitiful insolence!

19:36.000 --> 19:40.160
&lrm;The moment you challenged me
&lrm;was the moment you sealed your fate!

19:40.320 --> 19:43.440
&lrm;This battle is not yet over.

19:46.520 --> 19:49.800
&lrm;[stadium speaker] <i>&lrm;Remember,</i>
<i>&lrm;the high score to beat is 245,000.</i>

19:49.960 --> 19:52.880
<i>&lrm;So gamers, hit those consoles. Game on!</i>

19:53.320 --> 19:56.840
&lrm;After all you've done,
&lrm;now you want to pull out?

19:57.000 --> 19:58.640
&lrm;But I feel so bad for Max.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.640
&lrm;And well... it just wouldn't be right.

20:04.040 --> 20:05.840
&lrm;You're doing the right thing,

20:06.000 --> 20:09.600
&lrm;but you don't get the chance
&lrm;to play with Adrien every day.

20:10.560 --> 20:13.400
&lrm;Max... I thought about this a lot...

20:13.560 --> 20:17.440
<i>&lrm;And now, representing</i>
<i>&lrm;the Francois Dupont high school!</i>

20:17.600 --> 20:20.080
&lrm;I think you should be playing tonight.

20:20.360 --> 20:21.080
&lrm;What?

20:21.240 --> 20:25.800
&lrm;Don't get me wrong, I love gaming,
&lrm;but it's not my heart and soul.

20:25.960 --> 20:28.560
&lrm;This is your baby.
&lrm;It's your tournament, Max.

20:28.720 --> 20:30.760
&lrm;I won't take that away from you.

20:30.920 --> 20:33.800
&lrm;Dudes, make up your minds.
&lrm;They're waiting for you.

20:33.960 --> 20:35.120
&lrm;I insist.

20:36.640 --> 20:38.240
&lrm;How can I thank you?

20:38.400 --> 20:40.480
&lrm;By winning... with her.

20:40.640 --> 20:41.360
&lrm;[she gasps]

20:41.520 --> 20:44.960
&lrm;You're way better than me.
&lrm;You belong on the team.

20:45.400 --> 20:46.800
&lrm;Win it for the school.

20:46.960 --> 20:48.560
&lrm;[Adrien] I know you can do it.

20:48.720 --> 20:50.840
&lrm;Go on, dudes, they're waiting.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.320
&lrm;[Marinette hesitates]
&lrm;No... but... I...

20:53.480 --> 20:54.760
&lrm;Only with you.

20:55.200 --> 20:57.400
&lrm;[cheering] Let's show 'em who's gold!

20:57.560 --> 21:01.960
&lrm;[cheering]

21:02.920 --> 21:06.200
&lrm;[happy music]
