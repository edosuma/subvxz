You seemed friendly
with the StuffCo lady.

1:01:18.700 --> 1:01:21.624
Before I took this job with you,
I was an indentured orphan there.

1:01:32.900 --> 1:01:35.181
when she could have just treated me
like any other orphan.

It might sound... slushy to say it

1:01:38.180 --> 1:01:39.705

then go with that.

1:36:21.780 --> 1:36:23.305
[MACHINE RUMBLES]

1:36:28.980 --> 1:36:30.345
Ow!

1:36:41.260 --> 1:36:43.069
My darling Jennifer.

1:36:49.020 --> 1:36:50.545
[ZAMBINI LAUGHS]

1:36:54.420 --> 1:36:55.831
There are dragons again.

1:36:56.260 --> 1:36:58.581
I know.
- [HE LAUGHS]

1:36:59.380 --> 1:37:02.224
I owe them my thanks
for seeing you again now.

1:37:04.220 --> 1:37:05.301
Quite remarkable.

1:37:05.860 --> 1:37:07.021
I know!

1:37:07.060 --> 1:37:09.381
Come and look at them.
- No, no, no. I mean you, Jennifer.

1:37:10.820 --> 1:37:12.549
You see, the night we met

1:37:12.580 --> 1:37:15.424
I only really came
to seek out the last Dragonslayer.

1:37:16.500 --> 1:37:18.980
But soon I found that,
quite by accident

1:37:19.020 --> 1:37:21.182
I had instead brought home
a daughter.

1:37:22.500 --> 1:37:25.390
And you really are
quite remarkable, Jennifer.

1:37:26.460 --> 1:37:28.701
I'm so very, very, very proud of you.

1:37:30.740 --> 1:37:32.629
[DRAGON SCREECHES]

1:37:34.180 --> 1:37:36.831
I think dragons are reborn
by being slain in combat.

1:37:36.860 --> 1:37:38.703
[ZAMBINI LAUGHS]

1:37:39.340 --> 1:37:41.468
Shandar's border stones
kept soldiers away from them

1:37:41.500 --> 1:37:43.707
so they started dying
from old age instead.

1:37:43.740 --> 1:37:45.151
That's an interesting theory.

1:37:45.180 --> 1:37:47.740
I think that's why Maltcassion wanted me
to fight him. I think...

[ZAMBINI GROANS IN PAIN]

1:37:50.500 --> 1:37:51.990
How long do we have?

[DRAGON SCREECHES]

1:37:55.220 --> 1:37:57.029
[DRAGON GROWLS]

1:37:57.620 --> 1:37:59.907
I'll find a way to bring you home.
- No, you mustn't.

1:37:59.940 --> 1:38:02.784
These are dangerous
and powerful people, Jennifer

1:38:03.220 --> 1:38:05.871
and I would rather be lost forever
than ever see you come to any harm.

1:38:05.900 --> 1:38:07.550
Now will you promise me?

1:38:09.060 --> 1:38:10.060
No.

1:38:11.580 --> 1:38:13.150

SECRETARY:
Ahem...

1:38:55.300 --> 1:38:56.142
Yes?

1:38:56.180 --> 1:39:00.902
Mr Grieves would like to discuss
17 new Wonderbarn openings with you.

1:39:00.940 --> 1:39:02.942
Let's give him 10 minutes after lunch.

1:39:03.740 --> 1:39:07.950
And a Miss Jennifer Strange
has requested a meeting with you?

1:39:08.940 --> 1:39:13.582
Yes, erm, I think not.

1:39:14.220 --> 1:39:15.460

1:39:20.460 --> 1:39:21.460
SECRETARY:
There's a note.

1:39:22.460 --> 1:39:23.507
What does it say?

1:39:23.540 --> 1:39:24.540
SECRETARY:
It says...

1:39:28.660 --> 1:39:29.786
I insist.
