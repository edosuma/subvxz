25:53.480 --> 25:55.780
If he wanted them dead, they'd be dead.

25:55.880 --> 25:58.326
You seem to know a lot about this
Colonel Sikes.

25:59.040 --> 26:02.700
Would you mind telling us why "a commander
of an elite Special Forces unit"

26:02.800 --> 26:05.087
is on a military mission to save our city?

26:05.520 --> 26:09.500
While Colonel Sikes was hunting down
terrorists in Afghanistan,

26:09.600 --> 26:12.809
his wife and little boy, safe here
at home,

26:13.440 --> 26:16.887
were killed in a drive-by shooting,
completely random.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.446
The killer was aiming for a rival
gang member.

26:19.640 --> 26:22.928
And Sikes' wife and little boy just
happened to be nearby.

26:23.080 --> 26:24.780
His wife died almost instantly

26:24.880 --> 26:28.521
and the little boy lingered on for a few
more days before joining his mother.

26:28.640 --> 26:30.404
Did they ever catch the shooters?

26:31.080 --> 26:33.820
No, there were so many suspects,

26:33.920 --> 26:36.740
the police couldn't even determine
which gang was responsible.

26:36.840 --> 26:39.580
But it didn't matter anyway,
Sikes had already snapped

26:39.680 --> 26:43.571
and begun his self-ordered
mission to secure the homeland.

26:45.520 --> 26:47.249
What else should we know about this guy?

26:47.480 --> 26:49.900
Well, he doesn't drink, he doesn't
do drugs,

26:50.000 --> 26:52.765
he doesn't sleep around, and,
until recently,

26:53.600 --> 26:55.045
he didn't smoke, either.

26:56.080 --> 26:59.971
Well, we appreciate very much all
that information, Agent Porter.

27:00.960 --> 27:02.007
We'll catch him..

27:02.800 --> 27:04.060
Well, I hope you're right.

27:04.160 --> 27:06.640
But, no offense, Captain,

27:07.040 --> 27:10.442
I don't think that your department
is skilled, equipped,

27:10.560 --> 27:13.769
or trained enough to deal with
Colonel Sikes.

27:13.920 --> 27:16.300
He's been on Special Ops
missions all around the world,

27:16.400 --> 27:18.940
usually with entire armies chasing
him down.

27:19.040 --> 27:20.565
And they don't have to yell "freeze".

27:21.320 --> 27:23.766
So what makes you so qualified for
the job?

27:25.240 --> 27:26.810
I've been in those places with him.

27:34.160 --> 27:35.207
Hey!

27:40.120 --> 27:42.460
So are we supposed to arrest
everyone with a buzz cut,

27:42.560 --> 27:44.961
or are you gonna tell us
what this guy looks like?

27:46.120 --> 27:49.920
I already requested the Pentagon
send over Sikes' picture and file,

27:50.080 --> 27:53.127
at least whatever's not classified,
not that it'll help.

wonder if he ever existed.

28:14.600 --> 28:16.284

Until this become a federal case,
you're just a tourist here.

28:30.800 --> 28:33.087

be a target.

this reporter believes it to be
the work of a vigilante.

38:46.720 --> 38:49.405
A "super-vigilante," if you will.

38:49.800 --> 38:53.340

He then moved on to the notorious Snake Eyes
