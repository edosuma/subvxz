WEBVTT

00:09.183 --> 00:10.314
- I'm dropping
your mother's lawsuit.

00:10.358 --> 00:11.576
- What do you mean
you're dropping it?

00:11.620 --> 00:13.665
- The mayor offered me a job
if I let it go.

00:13.709 --> 00:15.450
- Well, while you're out here
cutting yourself a deal,

00:15.493 --> 00:17.234
I have to find my family
a place to live.

00:17.278 --> 00:19.410
- If I take this job,
I can do more than

00:19.454 --> 00:21.369
just save one housing project.

00:21.412 --> 00:23.675
- She's a threat to both of us,
Bobby.

00:23.719 --> 00:25.068
- And that's why I hired her.

00:25.112 --> 00:26.591
- Do your job
and let me know what

00:26.635 --> 00:27.853
Bobby's doing with this woman.

00:27.897 --> 00:29.159
- You want me to spy on
my brother?

00:29.203 --> 00:31.422
- If not for me,
do it for yourself.

00:31.466 --> 00:33.729
- The man who went up against
the city was found murdered.

00:33.772 --> 00:35.209
- If your friend knows
something,

00:35.252 --> 00:36.514
tell him to show you.

00:36.558 --> 00:37.646
- You're about to be
the mayor's

00:37.689 --> 00:39.343
brand new right hand,
I live with you,

00:39.387 --> 00:41.041
and that makes me a part of it.

00:41.084 --> 00:43.695
- So much for having my back.
- I do have your back, Jessica.

00:43.739 --> 00:45.828
But right now,
I need to look after my own.

00:45.871 --> 00:47.308
- Let me see.

00:47.351 --> 00:52.313
- Bobby, I have worked too hard
to be seen as that girl.

00:52.356 --> 00:53.836
- No one sees you as that.

00:53.879 --> 00:57.100
- She does, the woman that
you brought in to keep me clean

00:57.144 --> 00:58.232
sees me as that.

00:58.275 --> 00:59.581
- Lillian,
I dropped your lawsuit

00:59.624 --> 01:01.365
in exchange for a job
with the mayor.

01:01.409 --> 01:02.888
- I know,
but why didn't you tell me?

01:02.932 --> 01:04.716
- I made a promise to save
your home,

01:04.760 --> 01:05.891
and I couldn't make it happen.

01:05.935 --> 01:07.893
You have a problem
you need solved.

01:07.937 --> 01:10.200
Why don't you tell me what
Pat McGann has on you?

01:10.244 --> 01:11.245
- Where am I in all this?

01:11.288 --> 01:12.768
What happens if the truth
comes out?

01:12.811 --> 01:13.769
- Nothing's coming out.

01:44.626 --> 01:46.671
- Lillian,
what are you doing here?

01:46.715 --> 01:48.151
- Have you heard the saying,

01:48.195 --> 01:50.153
if the mountain won't come
to Muhammad?

01:50.197 --> 01:51.589
- Let me guess.

01:51.633 --> 01:54.723
This is about me not coming
into your home last night.

01:54.766 --> 01:59.641
- This is about me fixing you
a nice warm breakfast and that.

02:01.251 --> 02:06.126
Ooh, my, my, my.

02:06.996 --> 02:10.608
Wow, I've seen pictures
of places like this.

02:11.957 --> 02:14.743
I was under the impression

02:14.786 --> 02:18.312
that you lived here
with somebody.

02:18.355 --> 02:19.704
- It's complicated.

02:19.748 --> 02:23.360
- Oh, huh.
I had complicated once.

02:23.404 --> 02:26.233
Turned uncomplicated
when he walked out on us.

02:26.276 --> 02:30.628
- Lillian, this is incredibly
sweet of you, but I was

02:30.672 --> 02:32.935
about to run out the door,
and I'm running late--

02:32.978 --> 02:34.937
- Breakfast is the most
important meal of the day.

02:34.980 --> 02:36.808
- No, I know that, but I--
- No, buts.

02:36.852 --> 02:37.940
Go tell that boss of yours

02:37.983 --> 02:39.420
you'll get there
when you get there.

02:40.812 --> 02:42.466
Go.

02:46.862 --> 02:49.212
Let's see...

02:51.954 --> 02:54.217
- I'll be down in 15.
- 15?

02:54.261 --> 02:55.871
- Do you have some place
you need to be?

02:55.914 --> 02:58.439
- No, I've already been
waiting half an hour.

02:58.482 --> 03:01.485
- Then you'll get paid
for every minute of it.

03:01.529 --> 03:04.575
- My Lord, I know this man.

03:04.619 --> 03:07.665
- Oh, Lillian, I'm sorry.

03:07.709 --> 03:08.797
You weren't supposed
to see these.

03:08.840 --> 03:10.277
- This is Carl, my neighbor.

03:10.320 --> 03:11.713
What are you doing with
a picture of him like this?

03:11.756 --> 03:14.759
- It's just work stuff.

03:14.803 --> 03:16.979
Now what about that breakfast
you promised me?

03:17.022 --> 03:19.808
You gonna crack those eggs
or do I have to do it myself?

03:38.957 --> 03:42.657
Old school, I like it.

03:42.700 --> 03:43.919
Jessica Pearson.

03:45.486 --> 03:46.574
- I don't get it.

03:46.617 --> 03:48.880
- We never had
a formal introduction.

03:48.924 --> 03:50.317
Now that we're gonna be
working together,

03:50.360 --> 03:51.796
I thought it was time.

03:51.840 --> 03:52.797
- I wouldn't actually say

03:52.841 --> 03:54.016
we're gonna be
working together.

03:54.059 --> 03:55.800
- We're gonna be working
for the same man.

03:55.844 --> 03:59.587
And the way I see it,
that puts us on the same team.

03:59.630 --> 04:01.371
- Nick D'Amato.

04:01.415 --> 04:03.504
- Nice to meet you,
Nick D'Amato.

04:03.547 --> 04:05.288
Maybe next time
you're lurking in the shadows,

04:05.332 --> 04:06.811
you'll make
a proper introduction.

04:06.855 --> 04:09.379
- Well, since we're gonna be
working together,

04:09.423 --> 04:10.772
you should know
the mayor's got a thing

04:10.815 --> 04:13.383
about being on time.

04:13.427 --> 04:15.342
- Thanks for the heads up.

04:19.433 --> 04:22.044
- Oscar.  Hey.
- What up?

04:22.087 --> 04:24.089
- what happened to the posts
of your daughter?

04:24.133 --> 04:25.917
It's been a whole minute.
What, you holding out on me?

04:31.967 --> 04:34.535
- Obsessed, I'm telling you.

04:34.578 --> 04:36.406
- Tomorrow's her birthday,
putting on a fiesta.

04:36.450 --> 04:39.104
- Feliz cumpleaños, bebecita.

04:39.148 --> 04:40.541
I can't believe
she's three already.

04:40.584 --> 04:41.846
- Right?

04:41.890 --> 04:44.501
- Do you mind if I slip by?
I'm running late.

04:44.545 --> 04:46.503
- Yeah, we're all going
through security, lady.

04:46.547 --> 04:49.071
- Well, some of us are trying.

04:53.902 --> 04:55.947
- I don't need you to
valet my car,

04:55.991 --> 04:57.906
I just need to get to work.

04:57.949 --> 05:00.125
- Wait, you work here?

05:00.169 --> 05:01.997
'Cause I've been here
for five years.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.608
I know everyone in this place.

05:04.652 --> 05:07.437
- Apparently not everyone.

05:07.481 --> 05:09.961
I work for your boss.

05:10.005 --> 05:13.617
- Jason Epstein?
Uh-huh.

05:13.661 --> 05:16.098
- Your other boss,
the man upstairs.

05:16.141 --> 05:17.969
I knew you'd get it.

05:23.888 --> 05:26.543
- Who is that?

05:26.587 --> 05:28.806
- I mean, Jesus, he's already
getting a library.

05:28.850 --> 05:30.504
Now you want a stadium?

05:30.547 --> 05:31.853
- Nobody said stadium.

05:31.896 --> 05:34.029
It's a baseball field
for kids.

05:34.072 --> 05:35.683
- Trying to get Obama
elected again?

05:35.726 --> 05:37.989
- I'm trying to get you
elected again.

05:38.033 --> 05:41.776
- Sorry I'm late, I ran into
a little nuisance downstairs.

05:41.819 --> 05:44.039
- I was just leaving anyway.

05:44.082 --> 05:46.476
Why don't you take the rest
of the morning to get settled.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.435
Hell, take the rest of the day,
if you want.

05:48.478 --> 05:50.001
- The whole day?
- Mm-hmm.

05:50.045 --> 05:51.829
- That's Bobby's way of saying
you kicked ass yesterday.

05:51.873 --> 05:53.657
- Oh, Bobby might have
told me that before

05:53.701 --> 05:55.659
I made my driver run
four red lights.

05:55.703 --> 05:56.965
- That's 400 large.

05:57.008 --> 05:58.532
Do you want her to mail it in
or pay directly?

05:58.575 --> 06:00.534
- Give her a pass.
I'm in a charitable mood.

06:00.577 --> 06:01.709
- Oh, since you're in
a good mood,

06:01.752 --> 06:03.406
you might want to avoid
the elevator,

06:03.450 --> 06:04.494
take the back way out.

06:04.538 --> 06:05.756
- Oh, we got press?
- How many?

06:05.800 --> 06:07.410
- When they travel in
a pack like that,

06:07.454 --> 06:08.629
it's hard to count.

06:08.672 --> 06:10.065
- What do you say, Derrick?

06:10.108 --> 06:11.501
Should we throw 'em
a bone today?

06:11.545 --> 06:14.374
- I mean, I'm always the one
telling you not to dodge.

06:16.463 --> 06:18.508
- Have fun.

06:18.552 --> 06:21.119
- All right,
don't all jump at once.

06:21.163 --> 06:23.992
The mayor's been kind enough
to answer a few questions.

06:24.035 --> 06:26.864
- Hello, first floor.
What's it been, a week?

06:26.908 --> 06:28.431
- Nine days, actually.

06:28.475 --> 06:30.912
- Oh, now you're gonna
be accurate.

06:30.955 --> 06:32.130
- Have you thought
about a replacement

06:32.174 --> 06:33.131
for Alderman Coats?

06:33.175 --> 06:34.611
- Her resignation
was yesterday.

06:34.655 --> 06:35.612
It's an important ward,

06:35.656 --> 06:36.961
I don't wanna rush
the decision.

06:37.005 --> 06:38.049
- With all due respect,
your decisions lately

06:38.093 --> 06:39.790
don't exactly make
a lot of sense.

06:39.834 --> 06:41.444
- You wanna be more specific,
Terry?

06:41.488 --> 06:42.924
- Jessica Pearson.
You brought in

06:42.967 --> 06:44.752
a disbarred New York lawyer
to be your fixer.

06:44.795 --> 06:47.711
- Yeah, I did.
What's your question?

06:47.755 --> 06:49.931
- What exactly is Ms. Pearson
going to be doing for you?

06:49.974 --> 06:51.846
Is it legal?
- Give me a break.

06:51.889 --> 06:53.630
- It's a legitimate question.

06:53.674 --> 06:55.023
Why are you afraid
to answer it?

06:55.066 --> 06:56.241
- I came out here to do
you guys a favor.

06:56.285 --> 07:00.115
We're done here.
Get out of my face.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.389
What the hell was that?

07:13.433 --> 07:16.523
- I seriously hope you're not
blaming me for that.

07:16.566 --> 07:18.263
- You used to be one of them.

07:18.307 --> 07:19.917
From now on,
I wanna know every question

07:19.961 --> 07:21.441
they're gonna ask
before they ask it.

07:21.484 --> 07:23.617
- That little audible
was your idea, not mine.

07:23.660 --> 07:25.053
- If you want,
I can let you go.

07:25.096 --> 07:26.968
You can prowl the halls
with those assholes again.

07:27.011 --> 07:28.404
- Look, I'm not saying
you deserved it.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.492
I know those guys can
be brutal,

07:29.536 --> 07:30.537
but you had to know
they were gonna

07:30.580 --> 07:32.060
ask about her at some point.

07:32.103 --> 07:34.062
- I did know, and I was
prepared to answer questions.

07:34.105 --> 07:35.585
But she's been here
all of 48 hours.

07:35.629 --> 07:37.195
She's not even on
the payroll yet.

07:37.239 --> 07:39.067
- So?
- So someone leaked that

07:39.110 --> 07:41.069
to embarrass me or her or both.

07:41.112 --> 07:42.984
- Or people have
legitimate questions.

07:43.027 --> 07:44.725
- And by people, you mean you.

07:44.768 --> 07:46.596
- Hey, I like the woman,

07:46.640 --> 07:48.380
but even I don't know how
she ended up working for you,

07:48.424 --> 07:50.078
and I'm pretty sure
I don't wanna know.

07:50.121 --> 07:51.558
- Don't push it, Derrick.

07:51.601 --> 07:53.124
- Look, if you want,
I can try to figure out

07:53.168 --> 07:55.257
how they got onto her.

07:55.300 --> 07:57.041
- I don't need a PI,

07:57.085 --> 07:58.739
I need a press secretary
who protects me.

07:58.782 --> 08:01.089
Just do your job.

08:07.356 --> 08:09.576
- What do you think?
Homey, right?

08:09.619 --> 08:14.015
- Well, it's definitely...
lived in.

08:14.058 --> 08:15.451
- Just give it a good yank.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.762
- What are my other options?

08:21.805 --> 08:24.721
- Inventory's limited,
budget cuts.

08:24.765 --> 08:27.115
But now that I think of it,
my husband works

08:27.158 --> 08:30.074
in Water Management
and his boss just died.

08:30.118 --> 08:32.555
I can swap out your desk
before they pack up his.

08:32.599 --> 08:34.731
- You know what, I'm just gonna
pick something out, myself.

08:34.775 --> 08:37.212
- There's really nothing else
left in the warehouse.

08:37.255 --> 08:38.605
- No, I'm not talking
about a warehouse.

08:38.648 --> 08:40.607
- The city won't pay
for outside vendors.

08:40.650 --> 08:41.738
- Do me a favor.

08:41.782 --> 08:43.044
Have your friends
in Facilities

08:43.087 --> 08:45.307
clear this place out,
swap out the fluorescents,

08:45.350 --> 08:47.091
and there's a brand new
Nespresso machine

08:47.135 --> 08:49.180
with your name on it.

08:49.224 --> 08:51.139
- You got it.

08:51.182 --> 08:54.664
You ever need anything else,
come find me.

08:54.708 --> 08:56.623
- I will.

08:56.666 --> 08:58.668
- Okay.

09:03.368 --> 09:05.109
- Sorry, I had to take that.

09:05.153 --> 09:06.197
- No, don't worry about it.

09:06.241 --> 09:07.590
This won't take much longer,

09:07.634 --> 09:09.766
just wanna walk through it
with you.

09:09.810 --> 09:11.333
So, as we agreed,
we're gonna come up

09:11.376 --> 09:12.682
on the wages by 6.8--

09:12.726 --> 09:14.728
- I can't sign it.

09:14.771 --> 09:16.077
- What?

09:16.120 --> 09:18.558
- I'm not signing, Keri.

09:18.601 --> 09:20.342
- Eric, we're at
the one yard line.

09:20.385 --> 09:22.300
Please don't tell me you're
gonna go back on your word.

09:22.344 --> 09:24.259
- I'm not the one
being dishonest here.

09:24.302 --> 09:25.521
- What does that mean?

09:25.565 --> 09:27.305
- I can't negotiate
with a mayor

09:27.349 --> 09:29.394
who has an anti-police agenda.

09:29.438 --> 09:31.788
- Where is this coming from?
My whole family are cops.

09:31.832 --> 09:33.485
I defend the department
in court.

09:33.529 --> 09:35.052
- Against Jessica Pearson,

09:35.096 --> 09:37.228
who called the department
animals

09:37.272 --> 09:38.795
and took you
for a $4 million verdict.

09:38.839 --> 09:40.231
Or do you not remember?

09:40.275 --> 09:41.624
- She was nothing to do
with this.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.104
- Really?

09:43.147 --> 09:46.368
The mayor just hired her
to be his what, enforcer?

09:46.411 --> 09:48.065
Consigliere?

09:58.162 --> 09:59.729
We've known each other
a long time, Eric.

09:59.773 --> 10:01.644
My father was in the 8th
for 30 years.

10:01.688 --> 10:04.212
- And you are not the problem.

10:04.255 --> 10:06.475
- Okay, so believe me
when I tell you

10:06.518 --> 10:09.391
there is a firewall
between Jessica Pearson

10:09.434 --> 10:11.088
and this negotiation.

10:11.132 --> 10:12.394
- I don't know what
to tell you.

10:12.437 --> 10:16.354
I work for them,
this is what they want.

10:23.448 --> 10:25.625
- City Hall, this is
the Mayor's office.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.851
I don't have him, Ms. Pearson.

10:34.895 --> 10:37.549
- See, now, the last time
it was "the mayor's gone home."

10:37.593 --> 10:39.595
I'm starting to think
you're scared of me, Derrick.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.249
- Not at all.
- In that case,

10:41.292 --> 10:42.816
I know you're
the mayor's press secretary,

10:42.859 --> 10:44.774
but seeing as you're the one
that put these on my desk,

10:44.818 --> 10:46.776
and I don't have
an assistant...

10:46.820 --> 10:49.257
- You don't know where HR is.
- Keep going.

10:49.300 --> 10:52.347
- And you want me to bring
your paperwork to HR for you.

10:52.390 --> 10:54.218
- You read my mind.

10:54.262 --> 10:55.611
- Not exactly.

10:57.744 --> 11:00.181
- What's going on, Derrick?

11:00.224 --> 11:02.270
- You don't know.
- Know what?

11:02.313 --> 11:03.619
- You haven't heard anything?

11:03.663 --> 11:05.621
- No, I haven't heard anything.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.449
So are you gonna tell me
what's going on,

11:07.492 --> 11:10.147
or do you want an actual reason
to be scared of me?

11:20.767 --> 11:22.377
- I don't know which word
I hate more,

11:22.420 --> 11:23.857
disbarred or fixer.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.250
- Which word would you like,
Ms. Pearson, liability?

11:26.294 --> 11:27.687
'Cause that's what
your fast becoming.

11:27.730 --> 11:30.515
- That little run-in wasn't
just about you, Mr. Mayor.

11:30.559 --> 11:32.866
Whoever set it up did it
to embarrass me just as much.

11:32.909 --> 11:34.432
- You think I give a shit
about whether or not

11:34.476 --> 11:35.651
you got embarrassed?

11:35.695 --> 11:37.305
Our new contract
with the police department

11:37.348 --> 11:38.436
just blew up.

11:38.480 --> 11:39.611
- What are you talking about?

11:39.655 --> 11:41.048
- They just walked away
from a deal

11:41.091 --> 11:43.528
Keri's been negotiating
for months because of you.

11:43.572 --> 11:45.269
- Me?
- Yes, you.

11:45.313 --> 11:47.358
You're the one who went after
the 13th.

11:47.402 --> 11:50.231
- They brutalized a young man
who was already in handcuffs.

11:50.274 --> 11:51.493
- That was two bad cops

11:51.536 --> 11:52.886
and you made it about
all of them.

11:52.929 --> 11:54.322
Now it seems
they don't wanna be in bed

11:54.365 --> 11:55.540
with a man
who's in bed with you.

11:55.584 --> 11:56.803
- That's bullshit
and you know it.

11:56.846 --> 11:58.326
- Doesn't sound like
bullshit to me.

11:58.369 --> 12:00.502
You're not from around here,
these things run deep.

12:00.545 --> 12:02.765
I hate to break it to you,
but the police despise you.

12:02.809 --> 12:04.332
- The department may,

12:04.375 --> 12:05.812
but I'm guessing the only one
at the table

12:05.855 --> 12:08.815
when this went down
was an underpaid union lawyer

12:08.858 --> 12:11.252
who saw an opportunity
to squeeze you.

12:11.295 --> 12:12.906
- And let me guess.

12:12.949 --> 12:14.821
You want a shot at him.
- Two birds.

12:14.864 --> 12:16.823
Instead of telling the public
why you brought me in,

12:16.866 --> 12:18.607
which you should have had
an answer for

12:18.650 --> 12:21.262
this morning,
show them.

12:22.437 --> 12:23.873
- This is Keri's business.

12:23.917 --> 12:26.397
Take it up with her.

12:26.441 --> 12:29.531
- You brought me in to put out
your fires, Mr. Mayor.

12:29.574 --> 12:31.751
- Not the ones
you goddamn start.

12:44.415 --> 12:46.417
- My babies.
- Yay!

12:46.461 --> 12:48.419
- Hey, baby.
Come here, come here.

12:51.379 --> 12:52.815
Hey, baby.
- Hey, Mom.

12:52.859 --> 12:54.469
-  Hey, Mama.

12:54.512 --> 12:57.254
- Hey, you're home early.
Everything okay?

12:57.298 --> 13:00.431
- Well, you know, just one step
closer to nursing school.

13:00.475 --> 13:03.826
- You passed the test.
- With flying colors.

13:03.870 --> 13:07.264
Thanks, Mom!
Top 10%, says it right here.

13:07.308 --> 13:08.962
I mean, there's still
the part where I have to,

13:09.005 --> 13:11.268
you know, go to class
and pay for it and everything.

13:11.312 --> 13:13.401
- Oh, I'm so proud of you,
baby.

13:13.444 --> 13:15.490
We'll work it out.

13:15.533 --> 13:17.144
- Does that mean I can get
a PS4 now?

13:17.187 --> 13:19.015
- Let's try something smaller.

13:19.059 --> 13:21.104
- Like a laptop.
- Or pancakes.

13:21.148 --> 13:22.236
- Pancakes!
- Exactly.

13:22.279 --> 13:23.933
Success makes me hungry.

13:25.456 --> 13:30.026
- Mommy's gonna be a nurse,
Mommy's gonna be a nurse.

13:31.636 --> 13:33.856
- Mom, where are the eggs?

13:33.900 --> 13:35.858
- Oh, I used the rest of 'em.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.294
- When?
They were here this morning.

13:37.338 --> 13:40.167
- I went by Jessica's,
made breakfast at her place.

13:42.517 --> 13:44.519
- You went to her house
and made breakfast?

13:44.562 --> 13:46.913
- Well, I could go to John's,
pick up some more.

13:46.956 --> 13:49.480
- No, no, no, I don't want
you running to John's.

13:49.524 --> 13:52.005
All right, boys,
change of plans.

13:52.048 --> 13:54.050
Mac and cheese
or chicken nuggets?

13:54.094 --> 13:55.225
- Chicken nuggets!

13:55.269 --> 13:57.880
- Chicken nuggets,
coming right up.

14:00.578 --> 14:01.971
- I need a minute.

14:02.015 --> 14:04.017
- I'm sorry, I'm too busy
cleaning up your mess.

14:04.060 --> 14:05.975
- You know, we can keep
slinging mud at each other,

14:06.019 --> 14:09.283
or we can talk
like two grown women.

14:09.326 --> 14:12.852
- Oh, the feminist card.
You must be desperate.

14:14.244 --> 14:17.595
- No, I'm not desperate,
but I am sorry.

14:17.639 --> 14:19.380
- Can you be more specific?

14:19.423 --> 14:22.296
- I'm sorry my hire came back
around on you this morning.

14:22.339 --> 14:24.689
- Your hire didn't
come back on me, you did.

14:24.733 --> 14:28.563
- That trial was a battle,
Keri.

14:28.606 --> 14:30.565
I went after you
and the department hard,

14:30.608 --> 14:34.090
but my client suffered
at the hands of those cops.

14:34.134 --> 14:37.006
- You know what your problem,
Jessica, your ego.

14:37.050 --> 14:39.400
You can't even apologize
without justifying it.

14:40.662 --> 14:42.055
- Okay, you don't like me.

14:42.098 --> 14:43.273
- It's not that
I don't like you,

14:43.317 --> 14:44.927
I don't trust you.

14:44.971 --> 14:48.017
- Well, maybe over time
we can gain each other's trust.

14:48.061 --> 14:49.540
- Plan on sticking around
that long?

14:49.584 --> 14:51.542
- Long enough to help you
salvage these negotiations.

14:51.586 --> 14:53.196
- I'm trying to be

14:53.240 --> 14:56.112
upfront here,
not go behind your back.

14:56.156 --> 14:57.157
- So, that's my only option,

14:57.200 --> 14:59.028
I work with you
or you go rogue?

14:59.072 --> 15:00.638
- No one's talking about
going rogue.

15:00.682 --> 15:03.032
You take point,
I'll follow your lead.

15:03.076 --> 15:04.947
- I was two seconds away
from closing a deal

15:04.991 --> 15:06.427
that would ensure
the city of Chicago had

15:06.470 --> 15:08.690
an active police force
for the next three years.

15:08.733 --> 15:10.126
I don't take pleasure in
the fact that

15:10.170 --> 15:11.475
your past has come back
to haunt you,

15:11.519 --> 15:12.955
and I'm not trying
to punish you.

15:12.999 --> 15:15.610
I'm just not dazzled by you
like everybody else.

15:15.653 --> 15:19.440
So I will say this once,
woman to woman.

15:21.094 --> 15:23.052
Stay away from my negotiation.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.013
- ♪ We was on
the South Side ♪

15:27.056 --> 15:28.231
♪ Cruising in a Honda

15:28.275 --> 15:31.147
♪ Whipping with
the windows down ♪

15:31.191 --> 15:33.758
- Guys, please stick
to the approved format

15:33.802 --> 15:35.499
across all platforms.

15:35.543 --> 15:36.631
Thank you.

15:36.674 --> 15:38.546
- Tell that to the mayor.

15:38.589 --> 15:40.330
- What are you talking about?

15:40.374 --> 15:42.463
- He went Novak again.

15:47.294 --> 15:48.730
- Her?

15:51.341 --> 15:53.996
- Jessica Pearson. You brought
in a disbarred New York lawyer

15:54.040 --> 15:55.476
to be your fixer.
- Yeah, I did.

15:55.519 --> 15:56.651
What's your question?

15:56.694 --> 15:58.044
- What exactly is Ms. Pearson

15:58.087 --> 15:59.567
going to be doing for you?
Is it legal?

15:59.610 --> 16:01.786
- Give me a break.
- It's a legitimate question.

16:01.830 --> 16:03.440
- Why are you afraid
to answer it?

16:03.484 --> 16:05.529
- I came down here to do
you guys a favor.

16:05.573 --> 16:07.270
Get out of my way.

16:15.670 --> 16:17.585
- I'm coming out
the front door.

16:17.628 --> 16:19.500
Where are you now?
- Hey, that's her.

16:19.543 --> 16:21.458
- Why the hell not?
I told you ten minutes ago.

16:21.502 --> 16:24.374
- Ms. Pearson, excuse me.
- Just get here please.

16:24.418 --> 16:26.550
- Ms. Pearson--
- I'm sorry, excuse me.

16:26.594 --> 16:27.943
- When did the mayor
bring you on?

16:27.987 --> 16:29.597
- Why did you hire a phony
lawyer at your old firm?

16:29.640 --> 16:30.815
- I said all I'm gonna say
about that.

16:30.859 --> 16:32.295
- Just two weeks ago
you were suing the city,

16:32.339 --> 16:33.514
now you're working
for the mayor.

16:33.557 --> 16:35.298
Do you wanna explain that?
- No, I don't.

16:35.342 --> 16:36.691
- Ms. Pearson's late
for a meeting.

16:36.734 --> 16:38.258
Move aside now.
- Excuse me, sir.

16:40.086 --> 16:41.826
- Ms. Pearson.
Ms. Pearson!

16:55.536 --> 16:57.103
- You okay?

16:58.843 --> 17:01.542
- I didn't peg you
for the chivalrous type.

17:01.585 --> 17:03.500
- Nobody's ever accused me
of that before.

17:03.544 --> 17:06.503
- It was a compliment,
not an accusation.

17:06.547 --> 17:09.506
And it's my way of saying
thank you.

17:09.550 --> 17:13.162
- I owed you one
for the night we didn't meet.

17:13.206 --> 17:14.816
- Accepted.

17:14.859 --> 17:16.296
- Look, I don't know
if you were headed out

17:16.339 --> 17:17.862
to eat or whatever,
but if you want,

17:17.906 --> 17:20.865
I can sneak you back in
through mayor's entrance.

17:20.909 --> 17:23.259
- Well, actually, if you don't
have anything to do,

17:23.303 --> 17:25.174
I was headed over to
Avalon and 81st.

17:25.218 --> 17:28.134
- It's a rough neighborhood.
- You aren't scared, are you?

17:28.177 --> 17:30.092
- Well, the 50-minute drive
at this time of day scares me.

17:30.136 --> 17:32.486
- I can handle myself,
but I understand if you have

17:32.529 --> 17:34.314
to wait around for the mayor.

17:36.359 --> 17:39.319
- Avalon, huh?
Sure.

17:39.362 --> 17:41.582
Why the hell not?

17:50.678 --> 17:53.463
- You know what happens now,
don't you?

17:53.507 --> 17:55.161
- The Fire Department.
- Yep.

17:55.204 --> 17:56.727
- Gonna find out what the cops
turned down

17:56.771 --> 17:58.903
and double their demands.

17:58.947 --> 18:01.123
- It's three months away.

18:01.167 --> 18:02.385
I can't think about it
right now.

18:02.429 --> 18:03.734
- The election is
in six months.

18:03.778 --> 18:05.562
You wanna walk into that
with every cop and fireman

18:05.606 --> 18:07.216
in Chicago calling
for your head?

18:07.260 --> 18:08.565
- Okay, I get it.

18:08.609 --> 18:09.914
They're pissed that
I hired her.

18:09.958 --> 18:11.699
Question is, what do they want?

18:11.742 --> 18:13.614
They're just gonna walk away
indefinitely?

18:13.657 --> 18:15.311
- Hargrove's your friend,
ask him.

18:15.355 --> 18:17.139
- Any chance this is
just posturing?

18:17.183 --> 18:19.228
- Who gave you that idea, her?

18:19.272 --> 18:21.230
Bobby, this is not a strategy.

18:21.274 --> 18:22.753
- Come on, Keri.

18:22.797 --> 18:24.538
McBride's a lawyer,
he's not a cop.

18:24.581 --> 18:25.756
- Yeah,
but he's a union lawyer.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.367
He's been with them
for 14 years.

18:27.410 --> 18:29.195
He's practically one of them.

18:29.238 --> 18:31.762
And hiring this woman
is a slap in the face.

18:31.806 --> 18:33.808
Believe me,
I know how they feel.

18:35.505 --> 18:37.464
- Did you do that out there?

18:37.507 --> 18:39.944
- What?
- Leak her name to the press.

18:39.988 --> 18:41.337
- You think I would do that?

18:41.381 --> 18:42.599
- I know you don't want
her here.

18:42.643 --> 18:43.731
- No, I don't.

18:43.774 --> 18:45.211
I've been pretty clear
about that.

18:45.254 --> 18:47.387
And that was before
she blew up a negotiation

18:47.430 --> 18:51.217
that I was working on
for six months.

18:51.260 --> 18:54.698
I would never do anything
to hurt you,

18:54.742 --> 18:57.745
and I can't believe
that you think I could.

18:58.833 --> 19:01.270
- Keri...

19:01.314 --> 19:02.750
Shit.

19:10.236 --> 19:12.194
- They don't open
from the inside.

19:12.238 --> 19:15.110
- I wasn't going to say
a thing.

19:22.509 --> 19:24.250
Thank you again.

19:27.557 --> 19:30.299
- You do know I'm not leaving
you here.

19:30.343 --> 19:31.909
- Well, that's up to you.

19:31.953 --> 19:35.086
But I thought you had to be
available to the mayor 24/7.

19:35.130 --> 19:37.001
- What makes you think
it's a 24/7 job?

19:37.045 --> 19:38.394
Well, let's see,

19:38.438 --> 19:40.135
you bumped
into my former partner

19:40.179 --> 19:42.224
at O'Hare first thing
in the morning,

19:42.268 --> 19:44.792
you tried to intimidate me
at City Hall after work,

19:44.835 --> 19:48.230
and you stalked my apartment
building at midnight.

19:48.274 --> 19:51.102
It seems to me the mayor has
you on a pretty short leash.

19:51.146 --> 19:52.843
- I have some autonomy.

19:52.887 --> 19:55.106
- Then you can drive for me?

19:55.150 --> 19:57.587
- I said have autonomy,
not time to moonlight.

19:57.631 --> 19:58.849
- Here's the thing, Nick.

19:58.893 --> 20:00.590
I'm in the middle
of a firestorm,

20:00.634 --> 20:02.331
and the driver
they've assigned to me,

20:02.375 --> 20:06.248
to put it mildly,
is an idiot with an attitude.

20:06.292 --> 20:09.208
I can really use someone
who knows his way around.

20:10.861 --> 20:12.994
- I'll see if I can find you
someone.

20:20.262 --> 20:22.351
- Got a minute?

20:22.395 --> 20:25.224
- For the Mayor of Chicago?
Sure.

20:28.139 --> 20:31.404
So I heard about the contract.
Damn shame.

20:31.447 --> 20:32.405
- No games, Chuck.

20:32.448 --> 20:34.015
We both know
what this is about.

20:34.058 --> 20:35.625
- Do you know where I was
when I found out

20:35.669 --> 20:38.149
you hired the woman
who shit on my department?

20:38.193 --> 20:41.588
- Two of your own did that when
they nearly killed that kid.

20:41.631 --> 20:44.286
- I was at the 13th,
checking on morale.

20:44.330 --> 20:47.202
How do you like that?

20:47.246 --> 20:50.292
- She was just doing her job.
She was a lawyer.

20:50.336 --> 20:52.990
- From what I understand,
she's a New York lawyer

20:53.034 --> 20:55.341
who lost her license.

20:55.384 --> 20:58.561
So what is she doing for you?
- Whatever I want her to do.

21:00.302 --> 21:03.131
Look, Chuck, we go back
a long way.

21:03.174 --> 21:06.047
I have my reasons.

21:06.090 --> 21:07.483
Gotta trust me.

21:07.527 --> 21:09.180
- That's the main problem
right there.

21:09.224 --> 21:11.313
- What does that mean?
- Come on, Bobby.

21:11.357 --> 21:12.662
I'm already seen as
too chummy with you.

21:12.706 --> 21:14.490
Everyone knows we're close.

21:14.534 --> 21:16.666
- What the hell is wrong with
having friends in City Hall?

21:16.710 --> 21:19.190
- Nothing, as long as my guys
don't think I gave away

21:19.234 --> 21:20.931
their last contract
because of it.

21:20.975 --> 21:22.498
- I took money out
of Public Health

21:22.542 --> 21:24.195
to give you a fair deal
and you know it.

21:24.239 --> 21:25.980
- You and I know it,

21:26.023 --> 21:28.199
not the 12,000
who work under me.

21:28.243 --> 21:30.158
If I don't punch back after
you pull a move like this,

21:30.201 --> 21:32.247
well, I lose them.

21:34.075 --> 21:35.903
- So where does that leave us?
- What do you want me to say?

21:35.946 --> 21:39.080
As long as Jessica Pearson
is part of your administration,

21:39.123 --> 21:40.516
we don't have much
to talk about.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.213
- You need a contract, Chuck.

21:42.257 --> 21:43.954
- And you need a police force.

21:58.273 --> 22:00.928
- Jessica.
- I'm sorry, I know it's late.

22:00.971 --> 22:03.322
- Never too late for family.
Come on in.

22:08.109 --> 22:11.678
Cory, Mark, say hello
to your cousin Jessica.

22:11.721 --> 22:13.201
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:13.244 --> 22:14.333
Hi.

22:14.376 --> 22:15.725
I've heard so much
about both of you.

22:15.769 --> 22:18.249
- What you got there,
a whole supermarket?

22:19.773 --> 22:22.166
- Just some eggs, and, well,
a few steaks for freezing,

22:22.210 --> 22:23.994
and fresh lettuce for salad.

22:24.038 --> 22:25.387
- Oh.

22:25.431 --> 22:28.303
Believe it or not,
this is perfect timing.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.609
- Oh, good.

22:29.652 --> 22:32.699
- I was gonna run to
the corner and stock up

22:32.742 --> 22:35.571
in case we had to lay low
for a few days,

22:35.615 --> 22:38.357
but I didn't wanna leave
the boys alone.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.489
- Lay low?
For what?

22:40.533 --> 22:42.143
What's going on?

22:42.186 --> 22:43.666
- Some of the neighbors,
the people say that

22:43.710 --> 22:45.973
there's gonna be a blue flu.

22:46.016 --> 22:47.627
May have already started.

22:47.670 --> 22:49.542
- The police are striking?

22:49.585 --> 22:51.239
- The police don't strike.

22:51.282 --> 22:53.372
They get together,
and they all call in sick.

22:53.415 --> 22:56.113
- Well, striking's
against their contract.

22:56.157 --> 22:57.637
I know what it is.

22:57.680 --> 23:00.727
- The last time this happened,
things were real bad.

23:02.555 --> 23:05.601
- Are you worried about Angela
coming home tonight?

23:05.645 --> 23:07.211
- I'm worried about tonight,

23:07.255 --> 23:09.126
tomorrow and the day
after that.

23:09.170 --> 23:11.607
God only knows I'm no fan
of the police around here,

23:11.651 --> 23:15.785
but no police is a whole
different set of problems.

23:25.491 --> 23:28.276
- You knew about what's
going on, don't you?

23:28.319 --> 23:30.017
That's why you didn't wanna
leave me.

23:30.060 --> 23:31.540
- I may have heard some rumors,
yeah.

23:31.584 --> 23:33.716
- My family lives in
that building, Nick.

23:33.760 --> 23:35.631
How real is this?
- Look--

23:35.675 --> 23:39.461
- No, anything that starts with
"look," I don't wanna hear.

23:39.505 --> 23:41.637
I need that truth.

23:41.681 --> 23:44.335
- Let's just say if
there's a sick-out,

23:44.379 --> 23:46.033
this area isn't a priority.

23:47.208 --> 23:48.514
- Does the mayor know?

23:48.557 --> 23:50.254
- What do you think?

23:53.170 --> 23:55.085
- Bobby, you promised him
you'd be home

23:55.129 --> 23:56.391
before he went to bed.

23:56.435 --> 23:59.263
- I know, I just--I can't
get away right now.

24:00.395 --> 24:02.179
- Well, what do you want me
to tell him?

24:02.223 --> 24:05.400
- Tell him daddy's got
a miserable job.

24:05.444 --> 24:06.662
- Yeah.

24:06.706 --> 24:09.665
- Tell him I'll make it up
to him.

24:09.709 --> 24:12.276
I promise.
- I'll do what I can.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.105
I'll see you when I see you.

24:24.898 --> 24:26.726
- You working on a statement?

24:26.769 --> 24:29.598
- Four options depending on
how this goes down

24:29.642 --> 24:31.121
and when you go public.

24:34.429 --> 24:35.604
- What else?

24:35.648 --> 24:38.128
- Well, I hate to even
bring this up, but...

24:38.172 --> 24:40.391
- What?

24:40.435 --> 24:42.393
- This morning's thing
went viral.

24:42.437 --> 24:44.221
Now some woman upstairs
is retweeting it

24:44.265 --> 24:45.701
with some not too flattering
hashtags.

24:45.745 --> 24:47.181
- You're kidding me, right?

24:47.224 --> 24:48.704
You're bringing this to me
in the middle of all this?

24:48.748 --> 24:50.010
- You're already getting
a lot of heat,

24:50.053 --> 24:51.402
I didn't know how you wanted
me to deal with it.

24:51.446 --> 24:52.534
- Do whatever you have to do.

24:52.578 --> 24:53.709
How many times do I have to
tell you?

24:53.753 --> 24:55.494
Do your goddamn job.

25:03.850 --> 25:06.461
- Sources say that talks
between the police union

25:06.505 --> 25:09.246
and the mayor
broke down earlier today.

25:09.290 --> 25:11.727
And as a result,
locals have complained

25:11.771 --> 25:15.252
about a noticeable lack
of police presence.

25:15.296 --> 25:16.558
- Me and my daughter
were robbed

25:16.602 --> 25:18.255
coming home from the market.

25:18.299 --> 25:20.127
A man held a gun
in my little girl's face

25:20.170 --> 25:21.563
and nobody did a thing.

25:21.607 --> 25:23.434
I couldn't find
a cop anywhere.

25:23.478 --> 25:26.437
God knows what this place
will be like in the morning.

25:26.481 --> 25:29.571
- The last time there was
a so-called "blue flu"

25:29.615 --> 25:31.704
was back in 1993.

25:31.747 --> 25:34.228
Back then,
over a three-day period,

25:34.271 --> 25:37.274
violent crime spiked 32%.

25:37.318 --> 25:39.276
Reporting from Kenwood...

25:46.849 --> 25:49.373
- Thanks.

25:49.417 --> 25:52.028
- Are you Yoli Castillo?

25:52.072 --> 25:53.464
- Yeah.

25:53.508 --> 25:57.077
- You violated our social media
policy for personnel

25:57.120 --> 25:59.862
with that last tweet
you posted.

25:59.906 --> 26:01.908
- What now?

26:01.951 --> 26:04.824
- "Why is @MayorNovak
staffing up with NYC?

26:04.867 --> 26:08.001
"#SloppySeconds
#CleanUpCityHall

26:08.044 --> 26:09.785
starts by taking out
the trash."

26:09.829 --> 26:12.135
- That's from
my personal account.

26:12.179 --> 26:13.876
It doesn't say anything
about where I work.

26:13.920 --> 26:16.052
- Your handle is YOLOCastillo.

26:16.096 --> 26:17.750
You told the mayor
to "take out the trash."

26:17.793 --> 26:19.186
You're the social media
coordinator

26:19.229 --> 26:20.404
for Streets and Sanitation.

26:20.448 --> 26:22.058
- Okay, True Detective.

26:22.102 --> 26:24.278
For the average viewer, that's
just another private citizen

26:24.321 --> 26:25.584
speaking truth to power.

26:25.627 --> 26:27.150
- But you're not just another
private citizen.

26:27.194 --> 26:29.109
You can't publicly criticize
the administration

26:29.152 --> 26:30.458
when you're a part of it.

26:30.501 --> 26:32.286
- Okay, well, I don't happen
to share that opinion,

26:32.329 --> 26:35.115
but...sorry, I guess?

26:35.158 --> 26:37.160
- You need to take it down.
Now.

26:37.204 --> 26:38.814
- Wait, I just apologized
to you

26:38.858 --> 26:41.034
when I didn't really mean it,
that's a lot for me.

26:41.077 --> 26:42.339
I start buckling to censorship,

26:42.383 --> 26:44.080
I'm on the slippery slope
to hell.

26:44.124 --> 26:45.560
- It's not censorship,
it's policy.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.083
- Yeah, well,
it's a bullshit policy

26:47.127 --> 26:49.042
and the mayor should
know better.

26:50.304 --> 26:54.177
- Okay, I tried.
Thank you.

26:54.221 --> 26:56.353
- Hold on, Captain Ominous.

26:56.397 --> 26:57.964
What is that supposed to mean?

26:58.007 --> 26:59.574
- It means you're fired.
- You can't fire me.

26:59.618 --> 27:03.360
- Yeah, I can once word
gets back to your boss.

27:03.404 --> 27:05.101
Sorry.

27:07.277 --> 27:09.279
- Did I just get fired?

27:20.203 --> 27:21.465
- I hear some of your officers

27:21.509 --> 27:23.554
missed their flu shots
this year.

27:23.598 --> 27:25.469
- Wow.

27:25.513 --> 27:28.211
You got some balls showing up
here after you stuck us

27:28.255 --> 27:30.518
with a $4 million
frivolous lawsuit.

27:30.561 --> 27:32.912
- The young man that was beaten
and left for dead

27:32.955 --> 27:34.957
wouldn't call that lawsuit
frivolous.

27:35.001 --> 27:37.568
- I am a good cop, lady,
and so are almost every one of

27:37.612 --> 27:38.961
the men and women
who serve under me.

27:39.005 --> 27:41.442
- Is that why a quarter of them
are in bed right now

27:41.485 --> 27:43.139
putting innocent lives
in danger?

27:43.183 --> 27:44.488
- Don't believe everything
you hear.

27:44.532 --> 27:46.490
- Well, it's not what I hear,
it's what I know.

27:46.534 --> 27:48.449
Cops take the day off,
people get hurt.

27:48.492 --> 27:49.842
- This isn't on me.

27:49.885 --> 27:51.452
The mayor knows what
he needs to do.

27:51.495 --> 27:53.062
- Deliver my head on a platter?

27:53.106 --> 27:55.630
You and I both know
he's not going to do that,

27:55.674 --> 27:57.458
because that would make him
look weak.

27:57.501 --> 28:00.026
- And how do you think
I'll look if I cave?

28:00.069 --> 28:01.854
I already let Bobby kick
the can down the road

28:01.897 --> 28:02.898
on the pension last time,

28:02.942 --> 28:05.031
hell if I'll let him do it
again.

28:05.074 --> 28:07.250
- I thought this was about me.

28:07.294 --> 28:10.297
- I have to work to do,
Ms. Pearson.

28:10.340 --> 28:13.082
- I guess we're at an impasse.

28:20.481 --> 28:22.439
- Shit, do I need that.

28:26.530 --> 28:29.446
Thought maybe you were joining
your brethren out there.

28:29.490 --> 28:31.361
- What are you talking about?

28:31.405 --> 28:33.363
- You disappeared yesterday.
Where were you?

28:33.407 --> 28:34.669
- I rescued Jessica.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.192
The press were on her
like a pack of dogs,

28:36.236 --> 28:38.978
so I gave her a ride.

28:39.021 --> 28:40.675
She asked if I'd be her driver.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.024
- Did she?

28:42.068 --> 28:43.591
Is she taking over
my ribbon cuttings now, too?

28:43.634 --> 28:45.549
- It's not a bad idea,
you know.

28:45.593 --> 28:47.551
- McGann got you
on the payroll now?

28:47.595 --> 28:49.640
Hmm?
You his official eyes and ears?

28:49.684 --> 28:52.469
- You wanna talk to me
about working for McGann?

28:54.036 --> 28:55.559
- I'm up against it
with this police thing.

28:55.603 --> 28:56.952
I don't know what you're doing.

28:56.996 --> 28:58.475
You asking for permission?

28:58.519 --> 29:00.521
- I don't know what I'm asking.
I'm just bringing it up.

29:00.564 --> 29:02.044
- Well, since you don't know
what you're asking,

29:02.088 --> 29:03.263
let me answer it for you.

29:03.306 --> 29:05.700
You work for me,
no one else, that's the job.

29:05.744 --> 29:08.050
- What about the nights
outside her apartment, Bobby?

29:08.094 --> 29:09.095
That part of the job, too?

29:09.138 --> 29:10.749
- Keep your voice down.
- Think.

29:10.792 --> 29:12.446
When did I have to sit outside
like that before, Bobby, huh?

29:12.489 --> 29:16.015
Oh, yeah, when I was a kid
and it was your dad in there.

29:16.058 --> 29:18.321
- Nick.
- Enjoy your sandwich.

29:23.674 --> 29:25.415
- Congratulations.

29:25.459 --> 29:27.983
Thanks to you,
today's my last day.

29:28.027 --> 29:31.204
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that,
but if you think I had

29:31.247 --> 29:33.162
something to do with it,
you're mistaken.

29:33.206 --> 29:34.424
- Oh, come on.

29:34.468 --> 29:36.339
I retweet someone
throwing shade on you,

29:36.383 --> 29:38.080
on point by the way,
and the mayor's flack

29:38.124 --> 29:39.255
up and fires me?

29:39.299 --> 29:40.779
I know a hit job
when I see one.

29:40.822 --> 29:43.259
- It sounds like your itchy
thumbs got you fired, not me.

29:43.303 --> 29:45.435
- Admit it, the press went
after you today,

29:45.479 --> 29:47.220
so you found someone else
to take it out on?

29:47.263 --> 29:49.570
- And you're basing this on
the fact that I'm...

29:52.138 --> 29:53.574
- I was a waitress.

29:53.617 --> 29:55.010
I know what people
with money can do

29:55.054 --> 29:56.620
when someone like me
crosses them.

29:56.664 --> 29:59.101
- If blaming me makes you
sleep better Miss...

29:59.145 --> 30:00.799
- Castillo.
Yoli Castillo.

30:00.842 --> 30:02.801
- Ms. Castillo,
then believe it,

30:02.844 --> 30:04.019
but it's not true.

30:05.804 --> 30:08.067
- Oh, I do.

30:08.110 --> 30:10.069
And you know what I see?

30:10.112 --> 30:12.245
I see someone who gets up
at 6:00 every morning

30:12.288 --> 30:14.073
to feed the homeless
and still has the time

30:14.116 --> 30:16.989
to know the names of every
single person in this place;

30:17.032 --> 30:18.425
from Oscar at Security

30:18.468 --> 30:20.035
to the little old lady
in Zoning

30:20.079 --> 30:22.081
who likes Twinkies
from the vending machine.

30:22.124 --> 30:24.344
And I do it not just because
I'm a nice person,

30:24.387 --> 30:26.259
but because when my boss
needs something,

30:26.302 --> 30:28.000
I'm the one who gets it done.

30:30.132 --> 30:33.657
I killed for this job, lady.

30:33.701 --> 30:36.051
I know my rights.

30:36.095 --> 30:38.271
I'm not gonna let anyone
shut me up.

30:38.314 --> 30:40.751
- There's a difference
between knowing your rights

30:40.795 --> 30:42.666
and knowing when to use them.

30:42.710 --> 30:45.017
That's growing up.

30:50.500 --> 30:51.545
- No.

31:06.342 --> 31:07.735
- What do you want now?

31:07.778 --> 31:09.389
- It's not what I want,
it's what the police want.

31:09.432 --> 31:11.086
- If that's your resignation,
you don't need

31:11.130 --> 31:12.653
a whole file folder.
- It's not.

31:12.696 --> 31:15.525
It's a loophole set aside
for developers that saves them

31:15.569 --> 31:17.527
millions in property taxes.

31:17.571 --> 31:19.051
- What does that have to do
with this?

31:19.094 --> 31:21.575
- You close it, you can
fully fund the police pension.

31:21.618 --> 31:24.360
It's what they've been trying
to get for eight years.

31:24.404 --> 31:26.536
- You've spent too much time
in corporate boardrooms.

31:26.580 --> 31:28.364
Do you honestly think that's
what this is about?

31:28.408 --> 31:30.801
- I know that's what
this is about,

31:30.845 --> 31:32.499
especially after
my little chat

31:32.542 --> 31:35.371
with Superintendent Hargrove.

31:35.415 --> 31:37.112
- I specifically told you
to stay away

31:37.156 --> 31:38.331
from my negotiation.

31:38.374 --> 31:40.289
- My family lives on
the South Side, Keri.

31:40.333 --> 31:42.248
Or have you forgotten?

31:42.291 --> 31:43.814
The minute this affected them,

31:43.858 --> 31:45.642
it wasn't about you and me
anymore.

31:45.686 --> 31:47.470
- This thing is happening
because of you.

31:47.514 --> 31:49.646
- You think I don't know that?

31:49.690 --> 31:51.213
I just listened
to my aunt go on

31:51.257 --> 31:53.215
about how she's worried
about walking

31:53.259 --> 31:54.869
her grandbabies to school.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.654
Can you imagine how that felt?

31:57.698 --> 32:01.223
The woman who thinks
I can do anything.

32:01.267 --> 32:03.399
You wanna hear me say
I feel guilty?

32:03.443 --> 32:07.142
I feel guilty as hell.

32:07.186 --> 32:08.752
- How do I know you're not
playing me like you did

32:08.796 --> 32:10.537
the other day in court?

32:10.580 --> 32:13.366
- I guess you're just gonna
have to trust me.

32:23.202 --> 32:25.813
- I just got off the phone
with Chuck Hargrove.

32:25.856 --> 32:27.293
- Oh?

32:27.336 --> 32:29.904
- He says you guys reached
a deal.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.732
How'd you do it?

32:31.775 --> 32:33.734
- Well, I made him realize
that he had a short window

32:33.777 --> 32:35.997
to get what he wanted,
and if they went nuclear

32:36.041 --> 32:38.130
with the blue flu, he would
lose support of the public,

32:38.173 --> 32:40.132
a judge would impose
an injunction,

32:40.175 --> 32:44.310
and, well, they might as well
use the leverage that they had.

32:44.353 --> 32:47.095
- Jessica.

32:47.139 --> 32:48.792
- It was all
a negotiating ploy.

32:48.836 --> 32:50.316
They were looking
for a reason to walk away.

32:50.359 --> 32:53.493
- And I gave it to them.

32:53.536 --> 32:56.800
Now look at that,
she was right after all.

32:56.844 --> 32:58.759
- Yeah, she figured out a way
to pay for it, too.

32:58.802 --> 33:00.108
- Do I wanna know?

33:00.152 --> 33:02.893
- No, but you'll hear it
from McGann at some point.

33:02.937 --> 33:05.070
- Fuck Pat McGann.

33:07.115 --> 33:08.769
Thank you.

33:08.812 --> 33:09.988
- You're welcome.

33:11.467 --> 33:13.469
- I have to go
make a statement.

33:21.216 --> 33:24.045
I'm sorry about earlier.

33:24.089 --> 33:26.178
I was angry.

33:27.396 --> 33:29.181
I know you better than that.

33:31.400 --> 33:34.229
You seem like you wanna
say something.

33:36.101 --> 33:39.365
- Yeah, I was just thinking
if you're looking for something

33:39.408 --> 33:43.934
to tell the press about
why you brought her in,

33:43.978 --> 33:47.286
this could make you look smart.

33:56.860 --> 33:58.079
- Good evening.

33:58.123 --> 34:00.473
As you know,
we've been in negotiations

34:00.516 --> 34:02.388
on a new contract
with the police department

34:02.431 --> 34:03.911
for the past six months.

34:03.954 --> 34:07.001
Tonight, I'm happy to announce
that we've reached terms

34:07.045 --> 34:08.829
that both compensate
the good men and women

34:08.872 --> 34:10.831
who serve our city
and are consistent

34:10.874 --> 34:12.876
with keeping our city's budget
in check.

34:12.920 --> 34:15.183
Now before I bring up
Superintendent Hargrove

34:15.227 --> 34:17.098
to discuss the details
of the contract,

34:17.142 --> 34:19.231
I'd like to introduce
Jessica Pearson.

34:19.274 --> 34:20.884
Ms. Pearson played
a critical role

34:20.928 --> 34:22.060
in putting this deal together,

34:22.103 --> 34:23.409
and she'll be
an important part

34:23.452 --> 34:25.454
of my administration
going forward.

34:25.498 --> 34:26.977
Ms. Pearson...

34:28.936 --> 34:30.242
- Thank you.

34:30.285 --> 34:34.115
By now, many of you are
well aware of my past.

34:34.159 --> 34:36.987
It is a past that I own

34:37.031 --> 34:39.425
and one that Mayor Novak
has been kind enough

34:39.468 --> 34:41.470
to give a second chance to.

34:41.514 --> 34:45.387
What you may not know is that
my father grew up in this city,

34:45.431 --> 34:49.217
and it's taken on
a special meaning to me.

34:49.261 --> 34:52.177
And I am anxious to give
something back.

34:52.220 --> 34:56.877
Now, I know some of you
still have many questions...

34:59.009 --> 35:02.970
Come at me.
I'm an open book.

35:14.895 --> 35:16.157
- Impressive.

35:16.201 --> 35:18.028
- It helps to make friends
in Facilities.

35:18.072 --> 35:20.161
- I was talking about your
little unveiling back there.

35:20.205 --> 35:21.858
- I ran a firm for years.

35:21.902 --> 35:23.164
I know my way around
a microphone

35:23.208 --> 35:24.513
and some flash bulbs.

35:24.557 --> 35:27.429
- Cut the bullshit,
Ms. Pearson.

35:27.473 --> 35:28.865
You set that up the minute

35:28.909 --> 35:31.129
I faced those reporters
yesterday.

35:31.172 --> 35:33.000
You wanted both the firestorm
and the credit

35:33.043 --> 35:34.262
for cleaning it up.

35:34.306 --> 35:37.526
- You can't hide someone
like me, Mr. Mayor.

35:37.570 --> 35:40.486
The questions were gonna come
eventually.

35:40.529 --> 35:43.967
I figured if I laid bare
and got ahead of it,

35:44.011 --> 35:45.926
the sooner we could both
move forward

35:45.969 --> 35:48.581
and tackle some real problems
in this city.

35:48.624 --> 35:51.279
- You almost triggered
one of those real problems.

35:51.323 --> 35:52.411
Do you have any idea

35:52.454 --> 35:54.108
what could have happened
from that stunt?

35:54.152 --> 35:56.371
- I didn't plan on the police
pulling out of negotiations.

35:56.415 --> 35:58.678
- No? You're telling me
that was a coincidence.

35:58.721 --> 36:00.070
- It's Chicago.

36:00.114 --> 36:01.333
If it wasn't the negotiations,

36:01.376 --> 36:03.030
it would have been
something else.

36:03.073 --> 36:04.466
- So how'd it go?

36:06.164 --> 36:08.905
In exchange for reading
your lines,

36:08.949 --> 36:12.648
that reporter gets what,
a one-on-one with me?

36:12.692 --> 36:15.347
- Something a lot
more valuable.

36:15.390 --> 36:17.523
He gets access
to your number two.

36:17.566 --> 36:19.394
- Oh, is that what you are?

36:20.613 --> 36:23.572
I didn't say that out there.
- You didn't have to.

36:23.616 --> 36:25.618
- You put me in a bad position.

36:25.661 --> 36:28.098
- I did you a favor.

36:28.142 --> 36:31.232
The way I see it, you already
have too many secrets.

36:33.539 --> 36:35.193
- Good night, Ms. Pearson.

36:37.369 --> 36:39.545
- See you tomorrow.

36:43.026 --> 36:44.637
- Man in control.

36:47.074 --> 36:49.207
You looked good out there.

36:49.250 --> 36:50.686
- Thanks.

36:50.730 --> 36:53.385
- Why don't we go for
a drink and celebrate?

36:58.477 --> 37:00.392
- Good night.
- Night, Derrick.

37:00.435 --> 37:02.394
Will you do me a favor?
Tell Nick to pull around.

37:02.437 --> 37:04.483
I need to talk to him.

37:12.447 --> 37:15.189
I should go home.

37:15.233 --> 37:17.104
- Okay.

37:17.147 --> 37:19.715
- I wanna put my kids to bed
tonight.

37:19.759 --> 37:21.456
- Okay.

37:21.500 --> 37:23.284
- Okay?

37:23.328 --> 37:25.591
- I said okay.

37:30.726 --> 37:32.337
Good night.

37:35.601 --> 37:37.255
- Night.

37:44.566 --> 37:48.178
- So what is the name of
that little old lady in Zoning?

37:49.354 --> 37:53.009
- It's Ida.
What's it to you?

37:53.053 --> 37:55.316
- I can't very well hire
an assistant who doesn't know

37:55.360 --> 37:57.536
everyone in City Hall.

37:57.579 --> 37:59.451
You never know
when I might need something.

38:01.235 --> 38:03.281
You wanna hire me?

38:03.324 --> 38:04.760
- I do.

38:04.804 --> 38:07.241
- What happened to me learning
from this and growing up

38:07.285 --> 38:09.417
and all those other pearls
you threw at me earlier?

38:09.461 --> 38:11.158
- Like you said,
that was earlier.

38:11.201 --> 38:14.117
You've had plenty of time
to grow and learn.

38:14.161 --> 38:16.598
- I wish you would have
come to me sooner...

38:16.642 --> 38:17.947
- Oh.
- Uh, yeah.

38:17.991 --> 38:20.646
It turns out, I already got
another offer, so...

38:20.689 --> 38:22.256
- Ah.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.345
- Honey, I invented that move.

38:24.389 --> 38:26.129
But if that's how
you wanna play it

38:26.173 --> 38:28.610
and risk missing out
on all the action, well...

38:28.654 --> 38:31.178
- Okay, okay, you know what?
I want it.

38:31.221 --> 38:32.658
- Yeah?
- Yeah, of course I want it.

38:32.701 --> 38:34.486
- Okay. Mm-hmm.
- I want it.

38:34.529 --> 38:37.097
But...

38:37.140 --> 38:39.229
why are you doing this?

38:39.273 --> 38:41.275
I mean, for real, like,
besides the fact that

38:41.319 --> 38:42.755
you don't know where
anything is.

38:42.798 --> 38:44.757
- For the oldest reason
in the book,

38:44.800 --> 38:46.715
you remind me of me.

38:48.630 --> 38:51.677
Everyone deserves
a second chance, Yoli.

38:51.720 --> 38:55.550
And this job that I have now,
it's mine.

38:57.378 --> 38:59.162
- So when do I start?

38:59.206 --> 39:01.077
- Tomorrow.

39:03.863 --> 39:06.866
- ♪ I'm in my 20s,
living reckless ♪

39:06.909 --> 39:09.695
♪ So turn the hourglass over
and let's wreck this♪

39:09.738 --> 39:12.611
♪ It's a brand new world,

39:12.654 --> 39:15.178
♪ And every day

39:32.239 --> 39:34.720
- Angela, is everything okay?

39:34.763 --> 39:36.112
- Yeah, everything's fine.

39:36.156 --> 39:37.375
Police are back in
the neighborhood,

39:37.418 --> 39:38.506
doing what they do.

39:38.550 --> 39:39.942
- Do you wanna come inside?

39:39.986 --> 39:41.770
- No need for that,
I just wanted to pay you back

39:41.814 --> 39:43.468
for the groceries
you brought over.

39:43.511 --> 39:45.470
- I can't take that.
No, that was a gift.

39:45.513 --> 39:48.864
- A bag of food isn't a gift,
Jessica, that's charity.

39:48.908 --> 39:50.692
I can buy food
for my own children.

39:50.736 --> 39:52.346
- I never said you couldn't.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.566
- You know, part of the reason
I live where I live

39:54.609 --> 39:57.133
is so my kids can go
to St. Michael's.

39:57.177 --> 39:58.657
Did you know that?

39:58.700 --> 40:00.920
I'm doing that, and I just got
into nursing school.

40:00.963 --> 40:04.576
- That's fantastic, Angela.
But--

40:04.619 --> 40:07.274
- But take it anyway
'cause it's the only way

40:07.317 --> 40:08.493
you know to show love?

40:08.536 --> 40:10.451
-  Wow.

40:10.495 --> 40:14.237
- It sounds harsh,
but you and I know it's true.

40:16.501 --> 40:18.720
- Okay.

40:18.764 --> 40:20.635
What would you like me to do?

40:20.679 --> 40:22.811
- That's the thing,
you don't have to do anything.

40:22.855 --> 40:25.335
I saw you on TV.

40:25.379 --> 40:28.469
You wanna save the city,
that's good on you.

40:28.513 --> 40:31.341
But we were surviving
before you got here,

40:31.385 --> 40:33.474
and we'll be surviving
after you move on.

40:33.518 --> 40:35.520
- I'm trying to get
to know you.

40:35.563 --> 40:37.260
- Then try to get to know us.

40:37.304 --> 40:40.394
We don't need charity,
we don't need expensive steaks,

40:40.438 --> 40:42.483
and we definitely don't need
to be saved by you

40:42.527 --> 40:44.572
so you can feel better
about yourself.

41:20.608 --> 41:21.870
- Aaron.
- Aaron.

41:23.393 --> 41:24.612
- Oy!
