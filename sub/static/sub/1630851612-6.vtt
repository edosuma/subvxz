Now, we have discovered some
of the most talented singers
from all over america,

01:07.701 --> 01:10.536
and they're all here
with the hopes of becoming

01:10.571 --> 01:13.172
the next generation superstar.

All right, let's meet
our amazing panel of judges.

Right now,
at the head-to-head round,

01:46.073 --> 01:48.640
what are you exactly looking for
from the alter egos?

01:48.676 --> 01:51.677
I am looking to see
how integrated they are

01:51.712 --> 01:53.345
and how much they're embodying
their alter ego.

01:53.380 --> 01:55.147
And also I'm gonna add,

01:55.149 --> 01:59.084
is this a person who is going to
comfort humanity, uplift?

01:59.120 --> 02:02.087
They're unique position
to be in front
of a lot of people

02:02.123 --> 02:04.857
feeling many things right now
in these times.

02:07.061 --> 02:11.330

face off against each other.

be sent home.

It's time to introduce
the at-home audience to

02:21.742 --> 02:24.710

Alanis: <i> Siren versus seven.</i>

02:34.655 --> 02:36.488
This is another
very tough matchup

02:36.557 --> 02:38.657

both of them as artists.

02:38.692 --> 02:41.059

is gonna be an incredibly
hard decision for us.

07:19.706 --> 07:21.706
- Nick?
- We've sat here at this desk

07:21.742 --> 07:24.109
and watched and heard
a lot of performances.

07:24.144 --> 07:28.547
That was, like,
top three performances
of all the ones we've heard,

07:28.582 --> 07:33.585
and it's because superstars
leave you wanting to know more

07:33.620 --> 07:35.587
and hear more,
and you just can't get enough.

07:35.622 --> 07:39.057
And tonight,
I wanna know more.
I wanna hear more.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.725
Thank you, nick.
Thank you.

07:42.596 --> 07:43.662
Rocsi: Will.I.Am?

07:43.664 --> 07:46.064
You performed vulnerably.

07:46.099 --> 07:49.267
The low register was wobbly,
but it's okay,

07:49.269 --> 07:52.838
because you delivered
on the part that is
the most important part,

07:52.873 --> 07:54.940
and that is the transmission
of emotion.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.442
And your show was awesome,
so thank you.

07:57.478 --> 07:59.277
Thank you so much, will.

07:59.313 --> 08:00.946
Rocsi: Alanis?

08:00.981 --> 08:03.415
When you started the song,

08:03.450 --> 08:05.984
I thought, "oh, no,
we're just gonna stay low
on this one again.

08:06.019 --> 08:07.285
I really wanna hear the range."

08:07.321 --> 08:09.988
and then, boom,
you gave the range to us.

08:10.023 --> 08:12.791
You also gave us
the flipping into falsetto

08:12.826 --> 08:14.659
in a way that can be hard
for some people.

08:14.695 --> 08:17.095
You just did it with agility
and flexibility,

08:17.130 --> 08:18.630
so that was exciting.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.532
Thank you so much.

08:20.567 --> 08:24.469
I am really curious about
who's behind the scenes in a way
that I haven't been perhaps

08:24.505 --> 08:27.339
with some of
the other contestants.

08:28.942 --> 08:32.143
We're here to find, like,
who's gonna be a great artist,

08:32.179 --> 08:35.013
and I really got that
from you tonight, and...

08:35.048 --> 08:36.448
Thank you.

08:36.517 --> 08:37.816
I would say it was basically
a perfect show.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.651
Like, yeah, um,

08:39.720 --> 08:42.420

of winning the competition.

08:42.456 --> 08:44.389
Wow.

Seven, how is performing
as your alter ego

08:48.862 --> 08:50.896
helping you as a performer?

08:50.931 --> 08:54.900
You know, for so long,
my voice has never fit any mold.

08:54.935 --> 08:57.002
But now that I'm here,

08:57.037 --> 08:59.838
my voice is not only accepted,
it's celebrated.

08:59.873 --> 09:04.175
So I'm so thankful
for this opportunity.
It's phenomenal.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.845
Nick: Seven, you know what?
You said it, but it's true.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.813
Your voice doesn't
fit any mold,

09:08.815 --> 09:10.382
and that's what makes it
cool as hell.

09:12.019 --> 09:14.319
It's a hot, sexy voice.
I'm just gonna say it.

09:14.388 --> 09:15.620
It's just hot.

09:17.257 --> 09:18.390
All right, guys,
well, after the break,

09:18.425 --> 09:20.458
find out who makes it
to the semi-finals

09:20.494 --> 09:23.461
and who has to go home
right after this.

09:24.965 --> 09:27.699
I sort of see seven
as non-binary or something.

09:27.701 --> 09:30.936
Really?
But I thought seven
was a female.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.638
I had no idea.
I mean, I still don't know.

I still feel bad
sending people home.

09:48.021 --> 09:49.454
- ( groans )
- good luck.

09:49.489 --> 09:53.024

- Oh, my god.

09:57.664 --> 09:59.197
Nick: It doesn't get
much closer than that.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.072
Welcome back.
Now, before the break,

10:07.107 --> 10:10.442
seven set a very high standard
for this head-to-head,

10:10.477 --> 10:13.111
but I'm pretty sure
siren is ready to meet

10:13.146 --> 10:15.347
<i> and possibly exceed it.</i>

10:15.349 --> 10:17.782

13:08.188 --> 13:12.223
- Yeah!
- Amazing!

13:12.225 --> 13:17.095
First, let's take a second
and hear it for our
spectacular house band.

13:17.130 --> 13:20.899
It's adam blackstone
and the alter ego band.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.867
Whoo!

13:22.869 --> 13:26.004
Great job. Wow.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.907
Judges, is this someone
you can see winning

13:28.942 --> 13:30.575
the entire competition?

13:30.644 --> 13:32.177
Alanis, I'll start with you.

13:32.245 --> 13:34.546
I've been a fan of you
since the second I met you

13:34.581 --> 13:35.580
and your wave hair.

13:37.617 --> 13:39.350
Superstar.
There was a point in time

13:39.386 --> 13:40.618
where you were hitting
a certain note,

13:40.687 --> 13:42.020
and I thought it was
a keyboard, and I thought--

13:42.055 --> 13:43.588
yeah, I had to hit her.
I was like, "yo!"

13:43.623 --> 13:46.391
and he was like,
"that's her voice!"

13:46.393 --> 13:52.363
- the whole performance
- oh, thank you!M drizzled.

13:52.399 --> 13:53.431
Rocsi: Grimes?

13:53.500 --> 13:56.100
That was exceptionally perfect.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.870
I don't think anyone's
done whistle voice in this
whole competition yet,

13:58.905 --> 14:02.207
so that was just--
high risk and high reward.

14:02.275 --> 14:03.875
Grimes, what do you mean
when you say "whistle voice?"

14:03.910 --> 14:06.010
- like, really, really--
- ( vocalizing )

14:06.079 --> 14:08.780
- yes!
- What the what?

14:08.815 --> 14:12.383
- Siren: Yes!
- Man, you got tricks.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.152
- You got tricks.
- I've never heard it
called that either.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.153
That's what
she was talking about.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.621
Man, everyone's bringing it
tonight,

14:16.623 --> 14:18.957
and the way the band
was incorporated onstage

14:18.992 --> 14:21.125
and the horns
and the whole thing was just--

14:21.194 --> 14:22.093
it was really a moment.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.862
I felt like I was at a concert.

14:23.897 --> 14:25.630
I really did.
I felt like I was at a show.

14:26.900 --> 14:29.033
If I could give you
one small note,

14:29.069 --> 14:31.269
I guess it would just be
to continue to explore
your alter ego

14:31.271 --> 14:33.605
and how to make siren a star,

14:33.640 --> 14:34.973
but she sure feels
like one to me.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.708
- That's all I can say, so...
- Aw, I love that, nick.

14:36.743 --> 14:37.742
Thank you.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.946
- That song is
a - yes.Ong to sing.

14:41.948 --> 14:43.314
And then here you come

14:43.350 --> 14:47.585
and you bringing all type
of flow, power, soul.

14:47.587 --> 14:49.787
You know, I didn't hear
not one off note.

14:49.789 --> 14:51.122
You weren't flat,
you weren't sharp.

14:51.157 --> 14:52.590
Your voice is spectacular.

14:56.162 --> 14:58.029
One more time for siren.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.300
After two
fantastic performances,

15:02.335 --> 15:05.436
we'll find out who the judges
will send on to the diamond

15:05.472 --> 15:09.407
and to the semi-finals,
and who they will send on home
when we come back.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.342
More "alter ego" after this.

15:14.648 --> 15:17.582
Siren had such a crazy good
performance to me that--

15:17.584 --> 15:20.151
- I know.
- Grimes: But so did seven.

15:20.186 --> 15:23.621
Both of them are superstars
to me, so this is a rough one.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.631
<i> Places, everybody.</i>

15:33.667 --> 15:36.935
<i> Here we go.</i>
<i> In three, two, one.</i>

15:43.109 --> 15:44.242
Rocsi: Welcome back.

15:44.277 --> 15:47.578
It's time to find out
if seven or siren

15:47.614 --> 15:51.215
will be voted up to the diamond
and into the semi-finals.

15:51.284 --> 15:54.919
Judges, it's time
to make your decision.

16:00.493 --> 16:02.093
Nick.

16:02.095 --> 16:05.096
Seven, this next
generation superstar
that we're hunting for,

16:05.131 --> 16:08.266
I think you really truly embody
what that could be,

16:08.301 --> 16:11.703
the best combination of talent,

16:11.738 --> 16:13.638
technology, presentation.

16:13.673 --> 16:16.741
Your whole persona
is really fascinating,

16:16.776 --> 16:19.310
and your treatment of that
song tonight was really unique.

16:19.346 --> 16:22.347
Just overall, great job.
I can't say enough great things
about what you did.

16:25.986 --> 16:28.987
I'm just--

16:29.022 --> 16:33.491
I'm just a sucker
for that voice.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.994
And siren blew me away--

16:36.029 --> 16:38.096
blew me away
in the audition round.

16:38.131 --> 16:40.098
And for me I was, like,
unless siren

16:40.133 --> 16:42.533
does something tonight
to pull me back down

16:42.602 --> 16:44.736
off that high I was on
from the audition,

16:44.804 --> 16:47.905
I just couldn't see myself not
voting for her again tonight.

16:47.941 --> 16:49.440
In fact,
she elevated my high tonight.

16:49.476 --> 16:53.444
So in a very, very heartbreaking
and tough decision,

16:53.480 --> 16:58.683
I am going to vote
to put siren through

16:58.718 --> 17:01.052
- to the semi-finals.
- Rocsi: Grimes.

17:01.087 --> 17:04.255
Siren, I'm, like,
invested in the vocal.

17:04.290 --> 17:07.058
Like, I fully had chills,
which I almost never get.

17:07.060 --> 17:09.861
But then I'm caring about the
full artist package more here,

17:09.896 --> 17:13.765
and I don't think I've ever seen
anything like seven ever,

17:13.833 --> 17:16.934
so I will say seven, but, ugh!

17:20.907 --> 17:21.939
Rocsi: Alanis.

17:21.975 --> 17:24.575
So, siren,
I love your alter ego,

17:24.611 --> 17:27.011
and I really feel as though
you're one with your alter ego.

17:27.080 --> 17:29.414
And I love the ocean so much,

17:29.449 --> 17:33.151
so your hair just brings
great joy to me personally.

17:33.186 --> 17:37.588
Seven, there is something
magical about your range,

17:37.624 --> 17:39.157
and then tonight, my hearing

17:39.192 --> 17:41.259
that your range can go
in the opposite direction

17:41.294 --> 17:43.327
- equally as beautifully...
- Grimes: True, true, true.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.395
Alanis:
...Was exciting.

17:47.867 --> 17:51.869
I am going to put seven
on the diamond.

17:55.475 --> 17:58.476
So that is two votes
for seven,

17:58.511 --> 17:59.777
one vote for siren.

17:59.846 --> 18:02.547
Remember, if there is a tie,

18:02.582 --> 18:05.783
it will go to the audience
to decide

18:05.819 --> 18:07.285
who makes it
to the next round.

18:07.353 --> 18:09.854
Will, it's up to you.

18:14.127 --> 18:18.930
Siren, what a name
for your talent.

18:18.998 --> 18:22.300
You sing in perfect pitch.
It's dope.

18:22.335 --> 18:24.735
- Thank you.
- And then, like, seven,

18:24.771 --> 18:28.606
you have this ability to connect
with emotional intelligence,

18:28.675 --> 18:31.909
to articulate
exactly how you're feeling.

18:31.945 --> 18:34.178
And that's the difference
between a good singer

18:34.214 --> 18:36.581
and an artist,
and you have that,

18:36.616 --> 18:39.050
which makes my decision,
like, super hard.

18:39.119 --> 18:42.019
My decision reflects your voice,

18:42.055 --> 18:45.623
and the voice transports you
to a different world.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.659
All I know is when I was
in the projects growing up,

18:48.695 --> 18:50.194
I don't like sirens.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.196
But I like this siren.

18:52.232 --> 18:55.933
I wanna see you
on the diamond.

18:55.968 --> 18:59.604
That's two votes for seven
and two votes for siren.

18:59.639 --> 19:03.007
- Whoo!
- The votes are tied.

19:03.042 --> 19:06.944
Which means our studio audience

19:06.980 --> 19:10.214
will determine which alter ego
is moving on to the diamond

19:10.216 --> 19:11.983
and into the semi-finals,

19:12.018 --> 19:14.485
so please place your votes.

19:20.059 --> 19:21.526
I see a lot of sevens
in the audience.

19:21.561 --> 19:22.627
I see a lot of people
doing that.

19:24.130 --> 19:26.764
Rocsi: Is it gonna be
seven or siren?

19:26.833 --> 19:28.733
It is up to you guys
right now.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.173
( groans )

19:37.310 --> 19:38.743
the votes have been counted,

19:38.745 --> 19:41.946
and I can officially confirm

19:41.981 --> 19:45.383
by only four votes...

19:45.418 --> 19:47.185
- Oh, no!
- Oh, my god.

19:48.788 --> 19:52.490
That the studio audience
has voted for...

19:55.195 --> 19:57.995
Seven!

20:02.101 --> 20:04.669
Congratulations, seven!

20:04.704 --> 20:07.905
You will now move on
to the diamond

20:07.907 --> 20:10.041
and off to semi-finals.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.578
( groans )

20:13.646 --> 20:16.814
seven, we will see you
at the semi-finals.

20:16.883 --> 20:21.319
Ugh, unfortunately, siren,
you'll be leaving us tonight.

20:21.354 --> 20:24.755
Would you do us the honor
to sing one last time

20:24.791 --> 20:27.758
before you come out here
and reveal your true identity?

20:27.794 --> 20:30.461
- I'd love to.
- Yeah!

20:32.265 --> 20:34.365
- Damn.
- Wow, that was--

20:34.400 --> 20:36.434
- doesn't get much
closer than that.
- No.

20:36.436 --> 20:38.469
I think we made
the right decision.

20:38.504 --> 20:40.438
The fact that it was only
four votes difference

20:40.473 --> 20:42.707
validates that
we were bottle-necked.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.075
I'm actually really curious
to see who she is.

20:44.110 --> 20:45.843
Yeah.

( imitates siren )

22:09.896 --> 22:13.331
guys, this is mama yaya,
aka siren.

22:13.399 --> 22:15.599
- Nick: Mama yaya!
- Yes.

22:15.635 --> 22:18.469
How does it feel
coming out on this stage

22:18.471 --> 22:21.939
as mama yaya waving siren off?

22:21.974 --> 22:25.309
Siren has been
such a great shield for me

22:25.345 --> 22:30.214
because, you know,
I'm a plus-size woman!

22:30.283 --> 22:32.350
Like, it's not easy out here!

22:32.385 --> 22:35.052
It's not! Especially in
the music industry.

22:35.121 --> 22:38.389
Yeah, you still feel
the pressure and
the oppression, frankly,

22:38.424 --> 22:41.225
of having to show up
visually in a certain way

22:41.260 --> 22:43.427
in order to even
get in some doors.

22:43.429 --> 22:46.263
But if those are the doors
with those requirements,

22:46.299 --> 22:47.598
I'm not sure I want
to be in that room.

22:47.633 --> 22:49.400
I agree.

22:51.771 --> 22:55.306
I look forward to seeing what
your journey continues to be.

22:55.341 --> 22:57.441
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

22:57.477 --> 22:59.643
I'm still a warrior.
I'm still a fighter.

22:59.679 --> 23:02.146
I'm still gonna come out here
and do whatever I can

23:02.181 --> 23:04.315
to make things
work for me, so...

23:04.350 --> 23:05.916
That's powerful, mama yaya.

23:09.155 --> 23:12.089
You know what?
You are an amazing talent.

23:12.158 --> 23:14.859
And everyone got to see that,
so-- you changed me.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.827
I'm so honored to listen
to you sing.

23:16.863 --> 23:18.229
Thank you, nick.

23:22.835 --> 23:25.803
Rocsi: Thank you so much
for being here, mama yaya.

23:25.838 --> 23:29.507
- Thank you so much.
- You were freaking amazing.

23:29.542 --> 23:33.511
Up next, will aster's raw
and vulnerable vocals

23:33.546 --> 23:36.547
secure her a spot
on the diamond once again?

23:36.549 --> 23:39.683
Or will queen dynamite's
powerhouse voice reign supreme?

23:39.719 --> 23:42.553
It's aster
versus queen dynamite.

23:42.588 --> 23:44.655
Who's going to move on
to the semi-finals?

23:44.724 --> 23:47.324
Find out after this.

23:50.430 --> 23:52.029
So amazing.

24:03.976 --> 24:06.477
Welcome back to "alter ego."
I'm rocsi diaz.

24:06.512 --> 24:08.612
This is the only
singing competition

24:08.648 --> 24:11.182
that implements
unbelievable technology

24:11.217 --> 24:14.018
to give our contestants
a second shot at stardom

24:14.053 --> 24:16.887
and possibly change
the future of music.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.289
No big deal. I know.

24:18.357 --> 24:20.825
Let's meet our second
head-to-head tonight.

24:20.860 --> 24:23.394
It's aster
versus queen dynamite.

24:26.699 --> 24:29.600
Aster versus queen dynamite.

24:29.635 --> 24:30.868
So during the auditions,

24:30.903 --> 24:33.504
aster brought her
vulnerability to stage.

24:33.539 --> 24:36.841
Growing up,
I was told I was a star,

24:36.876 --> 24:38.709
and I really hoping
to embody that.

24:38.744 --> 24:42.713
And queen dynamite showed off
her diva queen style.

24:42.748 --> 24:44.982
♪ ain't nobody

24:45.017 --> 24:46.684
each of them is unique.

24:46.719 --> 24:49.854
♪ well, the sky is always open

24:49.922 --> 24:53.557
but aster needs to make
more of a connection with us.

24:53.593 --> 24:54.592
Thumbs up.

24:54.594 --> 24:56.627
And queen dynamite needs
to show us

24:56.629 --> 24:58.662
what kind of artist
she truly wants to be.

24:58.698 --> 24:59.797
Grimes:
I actually think your voice

24:59.832 --> 25:01.966
would suit well
in all kinds of genres.

25:02.034 --> 25:04.068
I think that is gonna be
one of the qualities

25:04.103 --> 25:06.737
that takes you really far
in this competition.

25:15.948 --> 25:17.114
Yeah!

25:19.252 --> 25:21.018
Aster, it's good
to see you again.

25:21.053 --> 25:22.353
Good to see you.

25:22.388 --> 25:24.622
I got feeling that tonight's
gonna be a good night.

25:28.461 --> 25:30.661
What's up--
what's up, miss dynamite?

25:30.696 --> 25:33.330
Hey!

25:33.399 --> 25:35.499
How are you guys feeling
since your auditions?

25:35.535 --> 25:36.700
I'm feeling great.

25:36.736 --> 25:38.869
I got over that first audition,

25:38.905 --> 25:41.338
over the nerves,
so I'm just ready to rock it.

25:44.110 --> 25:45.309
And you, aster?

25:45.311 --> 25:49.213
Honestly, I'm just hoping
that I can show you guys

25:49.282 --> 25:51.882
how I've grown throughout
just a short time,

25:51.918 --> 25:54.685
and I really just want to bring
my artistry into this song.

25:56.589 --> 25:58.188
How are you as competitors?

25:58.224 --> 26:01.692
I believe that,
you know, it's hard,

26:01.694 --> 26:04.428
but we're both queens,
but it's only one throne.

26:04.463 --> 26:08.098
Oh! "game of thrones!"

26:08.100 --> 26:10.034
I think that we're both
gonna bring it,

26:10.069 --> 26:11.835
and her being so amazing

26:11.871 --> 26:13.571
is really gonna
make me work harder.

26:13.639 --> 26:16.140
- Good luck.
- Good luck to you, too.

26:16.142 --> 26:19.343
- But I hope I win. I'm sorry.
- We will see.

26:19.378 --> 26:20.744
- Whoo!
- Let's do this.

26:20.780 --> 26:24.582
All right, guys,
have a good show.
Bring the best out.

26:24.584 --> 26:26.350
Aster, you're gonna be up first.

26:28.688 --> 26:32.156
Aster: <i> ♪ darling,</i>

26:41.100 --> 26:43.067

deserves to be on the diamond.

- Rocsi: There we go.
- Whoo!

26:45.338 --> 26:47.271
I was just kind of in shock.

26:47.306 --> 26:49.239
I'm so excited!

26:49.275 --> 26:52.309
Me being on this show is
a journey of self acceptance.

27:00.286 --> 27:03.454
That's something
that has affected me
throughout my life

27:03.489 --> 27:06.123
including performance
and music in general.

27:06.192 --> 27:07.825
There was something raw.

27:07.860 --> 27:10.527
It was taking
all those insecurities
that you've experienced

27:10.563 --> 27:13.931
and channeling them,
using them as fuel.

27:13.966 --> 27:17.368

27:17.436 --> 27:20.037
<i> I'm gaining so much</i>

In my head-to-head,
aster will be going against
queen dynamite.

<i>She can do a lot</i>
<i>of acrobatics with her voice.</i>

27:28.214 --> 27:30.514

pretty awesome,

27:30.549 --> 27:31.815
I think I can do better.

27:31.851 --> 27:34.952
Only one alter ego
can make it to the next round,

27:34.987 --> 27:37.254

<i> That's me.</i>

- That was hot.
- Thank you. Thank you.

29:36.475 --> 29:38.709
Well, you just made it
complicated for the judges.

29:38.744 --> 29:41.111
That's for sure.

29:41.113 --> 29:43.113
Nick, I'll start with you.

29:43.149 --> 29:45.916
Aster, overall I thought
really, really nice job.

29:45.951 --> 29:49.386
I noticed a couple pitchy notes,
but I think all in all,

29:49.421 --> 29:52.022
it was a really, really
a kinda cool take on that song,

29:52.024 --> 29:54.625
- and nice job. Nice job.
- Thank you. Thank you.

29:55.861 --> 29:57.294
Your performance was solid.

29:57.329 --> 29:58.862
I love your version of the song.

29:58.864 --> 30:00.497
You were rushing a little bit.

30:00.533 --> 30:02.132
Those are just nerves,

30:02.201 --> 30:04.802
but they're the special moments
and things you always remember

30:04.837 --> 30:07.471
if you can learn from them.
Thank you for the performance.

30:07.473 --> 30:10.741
I'm still trying to get over
how freaking bomb
the technology is

30:10.776 --> 30:13.510
with the belt you got on.

30:15.815 --> 30:17.014
I love you performance.

30:17.082 --> 30:18.949
I felt there was
a fluidity to it.

30:18.984 --> 30:23.387
The moments of humanity within
your alter ego performance
were exciting to me.

30:23.422 --> 30:26.223
There was more movement
in your physicality
in your alter ego today,

30:26.258 --> 30:27.991
so that was exciting
to see that growth.

30:27.993 --> 30:30.494
And I also
just kind of like you.

30:30.563 --> 30:33.263
- So that--
- thank you. I like you, too.

30:35.401 --> 30:37.568
So that counts
for a lot for me.

30:37.603 --> 30:39.369
I don't care about missed notes.

30:39.405 --> 30:40.838
I just like
a personality vocal,

30:40.873 --> 30:42.272
and I feel like you
have a personality vocal.

30:42.274 --> 30:44.808
- Mm-hmm.
- I think with the right song,

30:44.844 --> 30:46.677
you have what it takes to be
the next digital superstar.

30:46.712 --> 30:49.112
Thank you so much.

30:49.148 --> 30:51.248
All right, guys,
well, after the break,

30:51.283 --> 30:53.517
a performance from
an audience favorite,
queen dynamite,

30:53.552 --> 30:57.387
and we'll find out
which alter ego the judges
put on the diamond

30:57.423 --> 30:59.122
and into the semi-finals.

30:59.158 --> 31:02.459
More "alter ego,"
the head-to-heads, after this.

31:05.097 --> 31:06.797
- What game is that?
- You should play.

31:06.832 --> 31:08.398
- <i> Nice shot. </i>
- That is bananas.

31:08.467 --> 31:09.900
- That's dope.
<i> - Target eliminated.</i>

31:09.935 --> 31:12.402
- Wanna play?
- Unless you got
space invaders on there,

31:12.438 --> 31:14.404
it's probably
out of my wheelhouse.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.073

But remember,
this is a competition,

31:42.835 --> 31:46.870
and only one of these alter egos
can move on to the semi-finals.

31:46.906 --> 31:49.673

35:50.749 --> 35:52.949
I really feel
like the auditions,

35:52.951 --> 35:57.120
it kind of made me realize the
fire that I have for singing.

35:57.156 --> 36:00.524
Because, yes, anxiety and fear
stopped me a long time.

36:00.559 --> 36:04.561
But from this day forward,
I will never stop singing.

36:04.630 --> 36:08.298
Those days are over.

36:08.333 --> 36:09.366
Hearing performances like that

36:09.434 --> 36:12.569
remind us all
of why we enjoy music.

36:12.638 --> 36:14.704
If you have any struggle at all,
and you didn't have it
in that song,

36:14.740 --> 36:18.141
it's just allowing your voice
to sink into the subtle
moments of the song,

36:18.143 --> 36:20.177
- 'cause your voice
- yes.Big and powerful.

36:20.212 --> 36:22.913
And also, did you guys see
the way the sash on her dress,
I mean, the way that moves...

36:22.948 --> 36:24.114
- Yo, I know.
- Rocsi: Right.

36:24.149 --> 36:27.017
...While you're performing,
it's, like--

36:27.052 --> 36:29.219
the subtle things
with this technology,

36:29.254 --> 36:30.453
it's just crazy.
Crazy, crazy.

36:30.489 --> 36:32.889
Nick, question, after
seeing this performance,

36:32.958 --> 36:34.691
are you buying tickets
to the queen dynamite show?

36:34.760 --> 36:36.059
I already bought my tickets.

36:36.061 --> 36:38.662
Yes!

36:38.664 --> 36:40.997
Rocsi: All right, well,
don't go anywhere.

36:41.033 --> 36:44.134
We'll find out how the judges
vote when we come back.

36:44.203 --> 36:46.203
This is "alter ego" on fox.

36:49.041 --> 36:51.107
- That was really good.
- That was amazing.

36:51.109 --> 36:53.043
Her voice just comes alive
in those big wailing moments.

36:53.078 --> 36:54.377
- It's like...
- I know.

37:05.023 --> 37:06.990
Whoo!

37:08.894 --> 37:12.028
Welcome back to "alter ego."
I am rocsi diaz.

37:12.064 --> 37:14.064
We've just seen performances

37:14.099 --> 37:16.933
both of the alter egos
in this head-to-head matchup,

37:16.969 --> 37:19.536
and now there's only one thing
left to do--

37:19.571 --> 37:21.438
find out which one
the judges feel

37:21.473 --> 37:24.474
deserves the spot
on the diamond...

37:27.279 --> 37:32.616
...And also in the semi-finals.

37:32.651 --> 37:35.785
So, judges, who will it be?

37:35.821 --> 37:38.655
It's time to cast your votes.

37:41.426 --> 37:44.261
Aster, like, I really like
how much personality you have.

37:44.296 --> 37:46.896
I feel like you have
a strong artistic identity,

37:46.932 --> 37:50.467
and everything about you
is amazing to me

37:50.502 --> 37:52.669
except that I don't know if
it's fully coming together

37:52.704 --> 37:54.337
in the actual
performance itself.

37:55.874 --> 37:59.109
Queen dynamite, your show
has a whole package.

37:59.111 --> 38:01.177
You know, I feel
your vulnerability.

38:01.179 --> 38:02.579
You're great at singing,
you're great at dancing.

38:02.614 --> 38:05.448
You just have a whole thing.

38:05.550 --> 38:06.950
I think I'm gonna save
queen dynamite.

38:11.657 --> 38:13.923
Queen dynamite
has a dynamic voice.

38:13.992 --> 38:19.896
Aster has an amazing way
that she embodies the alter ego,

38:19.931 --> 38:23.500
but the vocal ability suffers.

38:23.535 --> 38:27.537
The audition was far better
than tonight.

38:27.572 --> 38:32.809
So, my decision is based on,
like, what's coming next.

38:32.878 --> 38:34.577
So, queen dynamite.

38:37.382 --> 38:42.152
That is two votes
for queen dynamite.

38:42.187 --> 38:43.687
Nick.

38:43.755 --> 38:46.756
You know, the marketability
of the next generation superstar

38:46.792 --> 38:49.292
is a big part of the equation.

38:49.328 --> 38:52.062
So, aster, I think your
performance tonight

38:52.097 --> 38:55.298
wasn't quite what
I had hoped it would be.

38:55.334 --> 38:58.435
We're looking for everyone
to kind of step their game up.

38:58.470 --> 39:02.405
Queen dynamite, I think
you're still discovering
who queen dynamite is,

39:02.441 --> 39:07.444
and you're still
discovering how to bring
that alter ego to life.

39:07.512 --> 39:11.348
So taking all those things
into consideration,

39:11.383 --> 39:13.216
I agree with my two friends,

39:13.251 --> 39:15.418
and I'd like to see
queen dynamite on the diamond.

39:15.454 --> 39:18.021
Rocsi: There you go!

39:18.056 --> 39:21.224
Queen dynamite,
that is three votes for you.

39:21.259 --> 39:24.761
You automatically head up
onto that diamond.

39:24.830 --> 39:27.097
Alanis, I'm just curious,
what is your vote?

39:27.099 --> 39:29.899
They both have my vote
for superstardom,

39:29.901 --> 39:33.336
but I was going to ask
queen dynamite to step
on that diamond.

39:33.372 --> 39:35.772
Rocsi: Unanimous.

39:35.807 --> 39:38.141
Queen dynamite,
take that diamond.

39:38.143 --> 39:41.544
You have been put on there
with a unanimous decision,

39:41.580 --> 39:46.182
which means you have secured
a spot in the semi-finals.

39:46.218 --> 39:48.351
Congratulations to you,
queen dynamite.

39:51.256 --> 39:55.892
Aster, that means this is
the end of your time here
at "alter ego."

39:55.927 --> 39:59.729
and we'd love you to perform
one last time

39:59.798 --> 40:02.399
and reveal your identity
to the judges

40:02.467 --> 40:04.667
by coming out here yourself.
How does that sound?

40:04.703 --> 40:08.271
- I'm excited.
- Nick: Yeah!

40:08.306 --> 40:09.939
Rocsi: I love it.

40:09.975 --> 40:11.374
We'll meet her soon,
but for right now,

40:11.443 --> 40:13.109
give it up for aster!

40:17.883 --> 40:19.949
- This is rough.
- Agreed.

40:26.792 --> 40:28.425
So who do you think she is?
Young girl?

40:28.460 --> 40:30.193
Yeah, like, young.

Judges, this is kaylee,
aka aster.

41:59.184 --> 42:02.118
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

42:02.153 --> 42:03.586
Kaylee, how are you feeling
right now?

42:03.622 --> 42:06.756
I honestly am just
so happy and glad

42:06.791 --> 42:08.625
that I was able to have
this experience.

42:08.660 --> 42:10.593
I feel like,
"okay, I can do this."

42:10.629 --> 42:14.664
that performance
was confident, strong,

42:14.699 --> 42:17.066
and that's kaylee doing that.
That's not aster.

42:17.068 --> 42:19.068
I guess it is.
That's kinda crazy.

42:19.104 --> 42:21.838
Why do you feel
you needed an alter ego?

42:21.873 --> 42:24.040
I really wanted to be able
to perform

42:24.075 --> 42:25.942
without fear of kinda, like,
what I look like

42:25.977 --> 42:28.511
or what people
may perceive me as,

42:28.547 --> 42:30.980
and I'm excited to take
what I've learned

42:31.016 --> 42:33.583
through that
out into the real world.

42:35.153 --> 42:37.921
- Thank you so much, kaylee.
- Thank you, guys.

42:37.956 --> 42:40.189
We're sending you home
with a lot of love

42:40.191 --> 42:42.625
and a huge round of applause
from the audience.

42:44.029 --> 42:46.763
Don't miss next week,
when we get even closer

42:46.798 --> 42:49.065
to finding our
next generation superstar.

42:49.100 --> 42:51.034
We'll see you then.
Good night.

42:51.036 --> 42:53.202
Thank you, guys, so much.
