00:13.083 --> 00:14.958
<i>-Hello?</i> <i>Genz here.</i>
-It's Hess.

00:15.583 --> 00:16.750
<i>You're early.</i>

00:17.250 --> 00:20.625
-I need a login for the video archives.
-Okay.

00:20.708 --> 00:22.958
I need to access the Hartung case.

00:23.041 --> 00:27.083
<i>Aren't you working with Thulin</i>
<i>on that amputated hand case?</i>

00:27.166 --> 00:29.666
Yes. How soon can you get me a login?

00:29.750 --> 00:31.791
<i>-I'll send it now.</i>
-Thanks.

00:36.791 --> 00:39.625
<i>This is the recorded interrogation</i>
<i>of Linus Bekker</i>

00:39.708 --> 00:41.625
<i>about the killing of Kristine Hartung.</i>

00:41.708 --> 00:45.666
<i>Parties present are</i>
<i>officers Martin Ricks and Tim Jansen,</i>

00:45.750 --> 00:47.375
<i>and the suspect's legal counsel.</i>

00:49.708 --> 00:50.541
<i>Linus?</i>

00:51.166 --> 00:54.458
<i>Can you tell us what happened</i>
<i>on Wednesday 3 November?</i>

00:54.541 --> 00:55.791
<i>In your own words please.</i>

00:56.458 --> 01:00.583
<i>I had one of those restless evenings,</i>
<i>so I went for a drive.</i>

01:01.291 --> 01:02.625
<i>That's where I saw her.</i>

01:04.125 --> 01:07.458
<i>The girl. Walking with her bike.</i>

01:08.333 --> 01:11.041
<i>What did you do afterwards with the body?</i>

01:11.125 --> 01:16.208
<i>-Can you tell us about that?</i>
<i>-I drove north with the machete in the car.</i>

01:16.291 --> 01:18.791
<i>And then I cut her up.</i>

01:19.625 --> 01:21.500
<i>I buried her in the woods.</i>

01:21.583 --> 01:22.583
<i>Where was that?</i>

01:27.500 --> 01:29.000
<i>I don't really remember.</i>

01:30.791 --> 01:31.708
<i>I can't remember.</i>

01:49.166 --> 01:51.291
There you go. Eat you fruit now.

01:51.375 --> 01:52.375
Off you go.

01:53.208 --> 01:54.708
My tummy hurts a little.

01:58.166 --> 02:00.875
Hey, listen. We were just talking.

02:01.958 --> 02:02.833
Okay?

02:03.333 --> 02:04.416
No one's upset.

02:05.750 --> 02:06.583
All right?

02:12.875 --> 02:14.208
Have a great day, sweetie.

02:38.833 --> 02:39.666
Hi, Mom.

02:39.750 --> 02:41.250
<i>Are you alone? Can you talk?</i>

02:41.333 --> 02:44.875
-Yes, they just left.
<i>-You made the right decision, Anne.</i>

02:44.958 --> 02:47.625
It may be the right decision,
but it's still not easy.

02:47.708 --> 02:50.083
<i>I know, but it's the right thing to do.</i>

02:51.208 --> 02:52.583
<i>I don't know the details.</i>

02:52.666 --> 02:55.750
<i>But the main thing is</i>
<i>for you to look after you and the girls.</i>

02:55.833 --> 02:57.125
I know.

02:58.125 --> 02:59.458
Okay. I'll see you later.

02:59.541 --> 03:02.750
<i>-And you'll be all packed.</i>
-Yes, I'll pack everything we need.

03:03.833 --> 03:07.125
<i>I love you, Anne.</i>
<i>Just remember, you're not alone, okay?</i>

03:07.916 --> 03:08.750
I love you too.

04:11.291 --> 04:14.916
THE CHESTNUT MAN

04:16.958 --> 04:20.500
MONDAY, 12 OCTOBER

04:20.583 --> 04:24.458
Unfortunately, no one can confirm
that you were at the motel Monday night.

04:24.541 --> 04:29.416
Nobody saw your car in the parking lot
before 7 a.m. the following morning.

04:29.500 --> 04:32.333
You've detained my client for 48 hours.

04:32.416 --> 04:35.208
But he maintains
he was in the motel all night,

04:35.291 --> 04:39.250
and that he didn't do anything,
so unless you've new information--

04:39.333 --> 04:43.875
Laura changed the locks
without your knowledge. Why?

04:44.583 --> 04:45.541
I already told you.

04:46.500 --> 04:48.625
Magnus probably lost his keys again.

04:48.708 --> 04:51.333
Yes, or she wanted
to end your relationship.

04:52.666 --> 04:56.166
She called you that evening.
What did she want?

04:57.916 --> 04:59.458
Did she break up with you?

04:59.541 --> 05:02.625
-You've asked that already.
-That must be hard.

05:02.708 --> 05:05.416
After all you'd done for her and her kid.

05:05.500 --> 05:09.250
It would only be natural
if you drove home to talk to her.

05:09.333 --> 05:12.041
-I didn't!
-But she was adamant.

05:12.125 --> 05:16.125
It was over. You needed to move out,
and you'd never see Magnus again.

05:16.208 --> 05:18.083
-You lost control of yourself.
-No.

05:18.166 --> 05:21.291
You cut off her left hand
with the engagement ring on it.

05:21.375 --> 05:24.416
Stop!
You can't detain my client any longer.

05:24.500 --> 05:27.666
He wants to go home and see the boy
as soon as he's discharged--

05:27.750 --> 05:28.583
Yes, please.

05:32.375 --> 05:33.333
One more question.

05:36.500 --> 05:37.625
Do you recognize this?

05:39.875 --> 05:40.708
No.

05:41.458 --> 05:42.500
Great.

05:42.583 --> 05:43.416
We're leaving.

05:45.291 --> 05:50.083
My client wants to be patient
while you conduct your investigation,

05:50.166 --> 05:51.583
but when can he go home?

05:51.666 --> 05:56.958
The house is sealed until we're done,
so he has to be patient a while longer.

05:57.041 --> 06:00.250
-We'll work it out. Thank you.
-Thank you.

06:12.833 --> 06:17.208
Abildgård,
did you find any photos of Hauge's car?

06:17.291 --> 06:18.125
No.

06:18.833 --> 06:22.916
The traffic cameras between Roskilde
and Husum must have captured him.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
It's a busy route with lots of cars.

06:25.083 --> 06:29.791
I know, but I'm only asking you
to locate one car here.

06:30.416 --> 06:31.291
Thulin.

06:32.166 --> 06:33.625
I want to show you something.

06:34.291 --> 06:38.208
-You haven't been here for days.
-No, I was reading up on osteology.

06:38.291 --> 06:40.541
Okay, so you've been learning about bones?

06:41.625 --> 06:42.458
Exactly.

06:43.041 --> 06:45.208
Follow me. My car's running outside.

06:54.625 --> 06:55.833
What's he doing?

06:56.666 --> 06:58.750
-Isn't he going back to Europol?
-No idea.

07:03.166 --> 07:05.875
I studied the Hartung case.

07:06.583 --> 07:07.625
The Hartung case?

07:07.708 --> 07:11.500
Before we start,
I need to know that I can trust you.

07:13.416 --> 07:14.250
I'm serious.

07:15.208 --> 07:18.541
Unless it takes all day,
and provided it's legal, you can trust me.

07:20.083 --> 07:22.041
According to the pathologist's report,

07:22.125 --> 07:26.791
Linus Bekker killed and dismembered
Kristine Hartung using a machete.

07:26.875 --> 07:30.333
Yes, he confessed,
and the evidence was overwhelming.

07:30.416 --> 07:32.958
The murder weapon was found in his garage,

07:33.041 --> 07:37.250
and the pathologist said with 100%
certainty there was blood on the machete.

07:37.333 --> 07:41.458
But something was missing.
I've brought an identical machete. And…

07:41.541 --> 07:43.583
-What the hell is that?
-Can you grab it?

07:44.708 --> 07:45.708
-You do it.
-Come on.

07:45.791 --> 07:46.958
-Do I have to?
-Yes.

07:47.041 --> 07:47.875
Why do I--

07:58.625 --> 08:00.500
Do you want to do something later?

08:01.583 --> 08:04.000
Mom's probably in meetings until late.

08:04.083 --> 08:04.916
Like what?

08:05.750 --> 08:06.833
I don't know.

08:07.791 --> 08:09.208
Something nice.

08:10.583 --> 08:11.416
Sure.

08:14.250 --> 08:16.375
What did the police want
the other evening?

08:19.875 --> 08:20.750
Did Mom tell you?

08:22.000 --> 08:22.833
No. I saw them.

08:25.333 --> 08:27.583
It was nothing. Just a misunderstanding.

08:29.375 --> 08:30.208
So it wasn't…

08:32.041 --> 08:32.875
No.

08:33.958 --> 08:35.125
Okay.

08:37.208 --> 08:38.958
-I love you.
-Sure.

08:40.250 --> 08:41.083
Bye.

08:54.125 --> 08:55.375
Watch where you're going!

09:03.250 --> 09:04.083
Mathilde?

09:07.416 --> 09:08.250
Mathilde?

09:11.958 --> 09:12.791
Hi.

09:13.375 --> 09:14.208
Hi.

09:15.208 --> 09:16.125
How are you doing?

09:17.791 --> 09:18.625
I'm okay.

09:20.166 --> 09:21.416
Can I ask you something?

09:21.916 --> 09:27.416
Last fall, when you and Kristine
were making chestnut men at our house.

09:27.958 --> 09:29.083
How did you make them?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.708
-The chestnut men?
-Yes.

09:31.791 --> 09:36.625
-Did you make most of them, or did she?
-We both did, I guess.

09:36.708 --> 09:39.291
What did you do with them?

09:39.375 --> 09:41.000
-We sold them.
-To whom?

09:41.083 --> 09:43.625
People you know,
or people just passing by?

09:43.708 --> 09:46.041
-I don't know.
-You don't know?

09:46.125 --> 09:49.000
Surely you remember who you sold them to?

09:49.833 --> 09:51.708
-Come on!
-We didn't know them.

09:51.791 --> 09:53.125
And you're sure?

09:54.083 --> 09:55.833
-It may be important.
-I have to go.

09:56.416 --> 09:57.375
Sorry.

09:58.708 --> 09:59.541
Sorry.

10:03.125 --> 10:04.750
I didn't mean to stand here and…

10:10.333 --> 10:11.250
We miss you.

10:14.666 --> 10:15.666
I miss you too.

10:17.208 --> 10:19.458
And her. Sorry, I can't…

10:22.666 --> 10:24.833
Wait! Was this last year?

10:25.958 --> 10:26.791
Yes.

10:28.916 --> 10:30.833
We didn't make chestnut men last year.

10:32.166 --> 10:33.708
It was too childish.

10:42.791 --> 10:46.375
We haven't done enough for children
whilst we've been in government.

10:47.083 --> 10:51.375
That ends now. With your party,
I'd like to allocate more resources

10:51.458 --> 10:54.583
to early prevention measures.
We know how important they are.

10:55.666 --> 10:59.666
We need more social workers
allocated to schools and nurseries,

10:59.750 --> 11:02.666
and we need to improve
the educational competences,

11:02.750 --> 11:05.166
allowing staff
to safeguard the children sooner…

11:05.666 --> 11:07.916
Gert? Am I boring you?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.500
Not at all.

11:09.583 --> 11:10.875
But this is nothing new.

11:10.958 --> 11:13.750
Yes,
I said it at last year's Budget talks,

11:13.833 --> 11:16.666
but we didn't get
the necessary votes to pass a bill.

11:18.208 --> 11:21.125
Rosa, I like you.

11:21.833 --> 11:24.375
I'm sorry for you and for your loss.

11:24.458 --> 11:29.375
But I think
the PM is trying to milk your situation.

11:29.458 --> 11:31.041
That makes me feel sick.

11:31.125 --> 11:33.958
-Bukke, I think--
-I don't know what you mean.

11:34.041 --> 11:37.875
Since you've been gone,
government approval rates are down.

11:37.958 --> 11:41.750
So now, the PM is trying
to create a free for all Budget.

11:41.833 --> 11:45.541
She's using her most popular minister
to act as some kind of Santa Claus

11:45.625 --> 11:49.250
to lure voters back before the election.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.791
But this cause
has always been close to my heart.

11:52.875 --> 11:55.166
It's nothing to do
with political pandering.

11:55.250 --> 11:56.625
Great, if you say so.

11:56.708 --> 12:00.125
But if our proposal
is a "free for all", let's talk about it.

12:00.208 --> 12:03.541
-If we're offering--
-We're offering nothing, Frederik.

12:04.708 --> 12:08.333
You need to discuss it
with his political group.

12:10.291 --> 12:11.333
If you'll excuse me.

12:15.791 --> 12:18.375
If Bukke is applying pressure,
we'll do the same.

12:19.666 --> 12:24.250
I'd like to arrange some interviews.
Today, if possible. And all week.

12:24.333 --> 12:26.166
-As many as you can.
-Is that wise?

12:26.250 --> 12:28.833
Our social policy
must be communicated and heard.

12:28.916 --> 12:33.625
We can force Bukke's support that way.
Otherwise, he'll look weak and indecisive.

12:33.708 --> 12:36.166
And when they ask you
about non-political topics?

12:39.125 --> 12:40.166
I'm not scared of that.

12:41.708 --> 12:43.791
Great, but we'll have to manage it.

12:44.625 --> 12:47.458
We need a strategy
so they don't pounce on…

12:49.541 --> 12:53.166
Well, how much you miss Kristine…
How hard it is, and if you cry often?

12:53.750 --> 12:57.083
Rosa, it mustn't overshadow
your political message.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
I was ordering a sandwich
and only gone for five minutes.

13:10.666 --> 13:12.708
Who would write something like that?

13:12.791 --> 13:15.166
MURDERER

13:15.250 --> 13:16.500
Let me call the police.

13:25.583 --> 13:28.166
Hess, please explain
what you're doing with the pig!

13:31.166 --> 13:33.375
I've a departmental meeting
in three minutes.

13:35.583 --> 13:36.416
Okay.

13:36.500 --> 13:37.500
There we go.

13:38.291 --> 13:39.500
Now, we need to wash it.

13:44.666 --> 13:46.083
FROM: SEBASTIAN
SLEEP AT YOURS TOMORROW?

13:46.166 --> 13:49.125
The bone density and strength
are similar to those of a 12-year-old.

13:49.208 --> 13:50.333
Is that a fair statement?

13:51.166 --> 13:53.416
Yes, I think so, but what's your point?

13:56.625 --> 13:57.458
Hess?

13:58.875 --> 14:01.375
Yes. Could you lend me a microscope?

14:02.166 --> 14:03.000
Sure.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.625
When you cut into bones,

14:06.708 --> 14:11.000
they leave microscopic bone residue
in cracks and crevices on the weapon.

14:11.083 --> 14:13.041
It is virtually impossible to remove.

14:13.125 --> 14:16.583
Unless you scrub the weapon
as vigorously as Bekker said he did.

14:16.666 --> 14:19.083
Yes, and I did that too.

14:19.166 --> 14:20.000
Take a look.

14:20.875 --> 14:21.708
Yes.

14:24.583 --> 14:25.416
Okay.

14:29.208 --> 14:30.041
Okay.

14:33.416 --> 14:34.458
I'll be damned…

14:35.083 --> 14:37.250
Bone residue. And so what?

14:37.333 --> 14:39.750
The technical forensics
of the murder weapon

14:39.833 --> 14:44.375
show blood residue from Kristine,
but no bone residue.

14:46.166 --> 14:49.916
So maybe Bekker didn't dismember her?

14:50.000 --> 14:52.666
The lack of residue
on the murder weapon is strange.

14:53.333 --> 14:55.208
But he confessed to the murder.

14:55.291 --> 14:58.916
And forensics did find Kristine's blood
on the machete in the garage,

14:59.000 --> 15:00.833
which means he did kill her.

15:00.916 --> 15:02.333
-Genz?
-Yes?

15:02.416 --> 15:03.541
We have to go.

15:07.708 --> 15:09.458
-Please excuse me.
-Sure.

15:15.166 --> 15:19.208
Why couldn't Bekker find the places
where he allegedly buried the body?

15:20.583 --> 15:24.416
He was diagnosed
as a paranoid schizophrenic.

15:24.500 --> 15:28.208
He's convicted of a string of sex crimes.
He confessed and was convicted.

15:28.291 --> 15:32.708
I fail to see what this has to do
with the killing of Laura Kjær.

15:32.791 --> 15:36.750
We found a chestnut man
with Kristine's prints on it at the scene.

15:38.708 --> 15:39.541
Thulin?

15:39.625 --> 15:40.708
Yes?

15:40.791 --> 15:43.458
Someone sent a text
to Laura Kjær's mobile phone.

15:44.416 --> 15:45.291
What does it say?

15:45.375 --> 15:50.083
Normally, we cancel the victim's contract
after our forensic examinations,

15:50.166 --> 15:51.583
but listen to this.

15:53.291 --> 15:56.166
<i>Chestnut man</i>

15:56.250 --> 16:00.875
<i>Come on inside</i>
<i>Chestnut man</i>

16:00.958 --> 16:05.666
<i>Come on inside</i>
<i>Do you have some chestnuts</i>

16:05.750 --> 16:08.333
<i>For me today?</i>

16:08.416 --> 16:09.500
Who sent it?

16:09.583 --> 16:12.458
The number's withheld,
but it was sent from town.

16:13.541 --> 16:14.833
When was it sent?

16:14.916 --> 16:17.208
A couple of hours ago,
but we only saw it now.

16:17.291 --> 16:19.625
<i>Chestnut man</i>

16:19.708 --> 16:24.416
But the only ones who know about
the chestnut man are us and the Hartungs.

16:24.500 --> 16:28.250
-How long before you can triangulate?
-I'm on it already.

16:28.333 --> 16:32.000
<i>Do you have some chestnuts</i>
<i>For me today</i>

16:38.750 --> 16:41.458
I've been such an idiot, honey. I'm sorry.

16:42.833 --> 16:44.791
It won't happen again. I promise.

16:44.875 --> 16:49.208
I've booked the couple's counseling
we talked about, so let's do that.

16:49.291 --> 16:52.666
I love you and the kids.
I can't live without you.

16:53.916 --> 16:58.166
Call me when you get this.
Thanks, honey. Bye.

17:40.541 --> 17:41.375
Come on!

17:43.125 --> 17:44.208
Your phone!

17:44.291 --> 17:45.708
-Phone.
-What's going on?

17:45.791 --> 17:46.708
We've got him.

17:49.083 --> 17:52.250
Laura Kjær, 37-year-old dental nurse.

17:52.333 --> 17:53.708
You sent her an audio file.

17:56.916 --> 17:59.750
I've no idea what you're talking about.
Who's Laura Kjær?

17:59.833 --> 18:04.000
The audio file's not there.
Just photos of women. Who are they?

18:05.708 --> 18:08.958
-I have no idea.
-Do you photograph women you don't know?

18:10.416 --> 18:13.875
-I'm married. It's not what you think.
-And the message to Laura Kjær?

18:15.125 --> 18:16.541
Does he have another mobile?

18:17.750 --> 18:19.541
I've no other mobiles.

18:21.250 --> 18:22.875
What are you doing?!

18:23.666 --> 18:26.375
I've not done anything,
but you put me in a police car.

18:26.458 --> 18:28.541
We traced the audio file to you.

18:34.791 --> 18:38.666
It's from Laura Kjær.
Why do you have a package from Laura Kjær?

18:38.750 --> 18:42.458
-What in the package?
-I had a text message and collected it.

18:43.291 --> 18:45.500
It's private. You can't just open it.

18:50.166 --> 18:51.166
Fucking hell!

18:52.250 --> 18:54.291
Let me out of the car. Now!

18:56.458 --> 18:59.791
-Let me out, goddammit!
-It's Thulin. Send forensics to Lima 2.

19:06.083 --> 19:07.916
I need you to think carefully.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.583
How do you know Laura Kjær?

19:12.666 --> 19:14.541
I already said I don't know her.

19:14.625 --> 19:16.916
-Where were you on Monday night?
-What?

19:17.000 --> 19:19.375
-Where were you?
-Where's your wife?

19:19.458 --> 19:21.125
-My wife? Why?
-Where is she?

19:21.208 --> 19:23.500
-Why do you need to know?
-Where is she?!

19:23.583 --> 19:26.250
At home, I guess. What's happening?
What is going on?

19:31.708 --> 19:34.500
<i>I've been such an idiot, honey. I'm sorry.</i>

19:35.791 --> 19:38.000
<i>It won't happen again. I promise.</i>

19:38.083 --> 19:41.916
<i>I've booked the couple's counseling</i>
<i>we talked about, so let's do that.</i>

19:42.708 --> 19:45.625
<i>I love you and the kids.</i>
<i>I can't live without you.</i>

19:46.875 --> 19:48.541
<i>Call me when you get the message.</i>

19:49.791 --> 19:51.125
<i>Thanks, baby. Bye!</i>

20:01.500 --> 20:02.333
Hello?

20:04.083 --> 20:04.916
Hello?

20:27.791 --> 20:29.916
-Nobody's home.
-I'll check upstairs.

20:32.125 --> 20:35.125
Signs of a struggle
in the bedroom and living room.

20:35.208 --> 20:39.208
The garden door was open when we arrived.
We've not yet searched the area.

20:42.416 --> 20:43.250
Hess!

20:43.750 --> 20:46.000
Report Anne Sejer-Lassen missing.

20:46.083 --> 20:47.375
Trace her phone signal.

20:47.458 --> 20:49.875
Ask the neighbors
if they saw or heard anything.

21:10.500 --> 21:11.750
We need K9 to attend.

21:13.583 --> 21:14.541
Call in the dogs.

21:27.125 --> 21:28.166
Anne?

21:33.625 --> 21:34.500
Anne?

21:37.500 --> 21:38.416
Anne?

22:11.708 --> 22:12.541
Hess!

22:16.833 --> 22:17.666
Hess!

23:05.208 --> 23:08.166
Why on earth
would someone write "murderer"?

23:08.250 --> 23:12.291
-<i>The police are asking that question too.</i>
<i>-</i>We'll talk about it tomorrow, Engells.

23:12.375 --> 23:15.250
-I have to go now.
<i>-No problem, bye!</i>

23:15.333 --> 23:16.916
<i>You're a minority government.</i>

23:17.000 --> 23:19.875
<i>How can you be sure</i>
<i>your supporting party is backing you?</i>

23:21.375 --> 23:24.416
<i>Thankfully, our coalition is strong,</i>

23:24.500 --> 23:29.291
<i>so I'm certain Bukke and his party</i>
<i>will make room in the Budget for this.</i>

23:30.458 --> 23:31.708
<i>Since you're here…</i>

23:31.791 --> 23:36.583
<i>After everything you've been through,</i>
<i>how difficult is it to be back?</i>

23:36.666 --> 23:39.375
<i>Naturally,</i>
<i>I'm not the same person I was before.</i>

23:39.458 --> 23:44.791
<i>My husband and I have decided</i>
<i>that life goes on.</i>

23:44.875 --> 23:47.833
<i>For our son's sake, and for ours.</i>

23:47.916 --> 23:52.583
<i>It helps me to take on responsibilities</i>
<i>that go beyond my family.</i>

23:57.625 --> 23:58.833
Careful, you'll burn it.

24:00.875 --> 24:02.708
You're doing great, honey.

24:04.583 --> 24:07.583
-Do you get angry with me when you see it?
-What do you mean?

24:09.458 --> 24:10.958
Well, that I talk about it.

24:12.250 --> 24:13.208
No.

24:13.291 --> 24:15.250
And you shouldn't be angry at yourself.

24:17.083 --> 24:18.750
You called earlier. What was it?

24:19.625 --> 24:22.291
I ran into Mathilde
at school this morning.

24:22.958 --> 24:23.916
How is she?

24:25.250 --> 24:26.166
We made a mistake.

24:28.083 --> 24:30.083
They didn't make chestnut men last year.

24:30.708 --> 24:33.666
Okay, it must have been
the year before that then.

24:33.750 --> 24:34.625
Rosa?

24:36.000 --> 24:38.625
-Where's the ketchup?
-Do you hear what I'm saying?

24:39.916 --> 24:42.708
Why did they find
Kristine's prints in Husum--

24:42.791 --> 24:45.666
Steen, stop! Don't. I can't take anymore.

24:47.916 --> 24:50.000
Gustav, dinner!

24:50.083 --> 24:52.125
What is it you want me to stop?

24:52.708 --> 24:53.833
-It's strange--
-Stop!

24:53.916 --> 24:55.333
-I'm trying--
-It's pointless.

24:55.416 --> 24:57.625
-I'm trying--
-Steen, she's dead.

25:03.375 --> 25:04.750
What are you talking about?

25:05.333 --> 25:06.416
Nothing, sweetie.

25:06.500 --> 25:09.833
-Do you want a cola? Go and get one.
-No, thanks.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.500
-I don't feel like it.
-Okay.

25:14.416 --> 25:17.083
You were supposed to lay the table.
I forgot.

25:17.166 --> 25:18.250
Come on, get to it!

25:22.750 --> 25:25.000
How was tennis practice?

25:25.791 --> 25:26.625
It was fine.

25:27.500 --> 25:29.541
Henrik was out sick.

25:29.625 --> 25:32.375
-Oh, okay.
-So it was all nice and easy.

25:32.458 --> 25:34.125
Yeah, great.

25:34.916 --> 25:37.708
And? Did you beat him today?

25:41.291 --> 25:43.625
We've found a chestnut man in the house.

25:44.541 --> 25:45.750
Any witnesses?

25:47.666 --> 25:49.958
-Dog walkers, joggers etcetera?
-We're on it!

25:52.333 --> 25:56.208
-Thomsen and Kragh, you search the house.
-<i>Copy that.</i>

25:56.291 --> 25:58.750
Abildgård,
grab the forest ranger when he arrives.

25:58.833 --> 26:00.291
<i>I will. He's here now.</i>

26:07.291 --> 26:09.750
-Do you want to know about this first?
-Yes.

26:09.833 --> 26:11.833
-I'll hurry!
-<i>Charlie 5 is enroute.</i>

26:13.333 --> 26:15.458
<i>I'll set up road blocks…</i>

27:37.333 --> 27:38.833
I watched the news last night.

27:41.625 --> 27:44.083
Are you sure
you're right for this investigation?

27:46.916 --> 27:50.000
Yes, and that's the problem.

28:01.250 --> 28:02.916
-Here. Let me take it.
-Thank you.

28:06.500 --> 28:09.958
Don't forget the lantern festival
at Le's school tonight.

28:15.583 --> 28:19.541
LANTERN FESTIVAL AT THE SCHOOL

28:33.541 --> 28:34.375
Good morning.

28:35.125 --> 28:38.666
Didn't you hear
about the new recycling bins?

28:39.458 --> 28:41.875
Plastic, metal and biodegradables…

28:44.666 --> 28:46.583
-What time is it?
-Are you stuck?

28:46.666 --> 28:48.875
-Could you stop that?
-Come here.

28:50.083 --> 28:53.500
You'll have to do something
about the floors, if you want to sell it.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.416
Where the hell is my phone?

28:57.166 --> 29:00.083
There is a sander in the basement.
I can bring it.

29:02.208 --> 29:07.750
And if you're looking for an estate agent,
my friend's good at selling properties.

29:12.208 --> 29:14.458
-Great, thanks.
-Bad news?

29:15.916 --> 29:17.291
TUESDAY, 13 OCTOBER

29:17.375 --> 29:21.125
Both victims are in their 30s,
both were attacked in their homes.

29:21.916 --> 29:25.541
Preliminary examinations show
they were killed by blunt force trauma

29:25.625 --> 29:29.000
which penetrated the eye and the brain.

29:29.083 --> 29:33.083
The first victim had
her left hand amputated.

29:33.166 --> 29:36.625
The second victim had
both her left and right hands amputated.

29:36.708 --> 29:41.083
Probably with a battery-powered saw,
but we're checking the various models.

29:41.166 --> 29:46.541
What about the phone
used to send a text to Kjær's mobile?

29:46.625 --> 29:49.041
It had a prepaid SIM card.

29:49.958 --> 29:52.875
The serial number was removed,
so we can't trace it.

29:52.958 --> 29:56.041
-And who sent the package?
-It says it was Laura Kjær.

29:56.125 --> 29:59.583
The perpetrator had left
the package outside her front door,

29:59.666 --> 30:01.083
and a delivery guy found it.

30:02.625 --> 30:03.666
We initially--

30:05.250 --> 30:10.416
We initially suspected
Kjær's partner, Hans Henrik Hauge.

30:10.500 --> 30:14.583
But it turns out
that he was with his lawyer last night.

30:14.666 --> 30:17.125
So, we've got jackshit?

30:18.041 --> 30:20.166
We assume the victims aren't connected.

30:20.250 --> 30:24.083
Except for
the chestnut men and the prints.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.750
We found chestnut men
close to both crime scenes.

30:29.625 --> 30:33.416
We found a fingerprint
on both chestnut men,

30:33.500 --> 30:36.125
and the dactyloscopic forensics show

30:36.666 --> 30:38.500
that the prints are identical…

30:39.916 --> 30:41.375
to those of Kristine Hartung.

30:42.416 --> 30:43.250
What?

30:43.333 --> 30:45.708
-That can't be true!
-Listen…

30:47.083 --> 30:50.541
Guys, that's all we know right now.

30:50.625 --> 30:54.500
It may turn out that the prints
have no bearing on our case.

30:55.208 --> 30:56.541
How old are the chestnuts?

30:57.250 --> 31:00.458
We don't know.
The University's science faculty says

31:00.541 --> 31:05.083
they may a few weeks or a year old,
depending on their storage.

31:05.166 --> 31:07.250
We're all affected by this case,

31:07.333 --> 31:10.166
and I'm reminding you
that it's strictly confidential.

31:10.250 --> 31:12.208
We have to reopen the Hartung case.

31:12.291 --> 31:14.416
One print may be coincidental. Not two.

31:14.500 --> 31:16.791
If those are Hartung's prints,

31:16.875 --> 31:19.416
the theory about
her disappearance may be wrong.

31:20.833 --> 31:22.833
So you're saying we didn't do our job?

31:24.500 --> 31:27.041
No, I'm not. This isn't personal.

31:27.666 --> 31:29.375
I'm not taking it personally.

31:29.458 --> 31:32.750
But it's odd to be criticized by someone

31:32.833 --> 31:35.666
who's only just here,
because he fucked up in The Hague.

31:40.625 --> 31:43.708
Hess, do you know
how many resources we sunk into this one?

31:43.791 --> 31:46.541
Maybe the forensics
back then weren't good enough?

31:46.625 --> 31:49.375
We have new prints,
and you have to deal with them!

31:49.458 --> 31:51.708
The colleagues are working 24/7.

31:51.791 --> 31:55.291
Don't offer your speculations
unless you can back them up.

31:57.708 --> 31:59.166
There'll be more killings.

32:00.000 --> 32:00.875
What do you mean?

32:02.750 --> 32:05.791
Think of a chestnut man.
It has no hands or feet.

32:05.875 --> 32:09.541
The first victim lost one hand.
The second one lost both hands.

32:09.625 --> 32:11.041
Fuck, you're not saying--

32:11.125 --> 32:14.333
Kristine Hartung
and the chestnut man connect them,

32:14.416 --> 32:16.458
so we need to speak to the family.

32:16.541 --> 32:18.791
I'll do it. You're not going!

32:18.875 --> 32:20.666
Not until you can back this up.

32:20.750 --> 32:23.208
Forget Hartung.
You must've missed something else.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.458
I'd like to speak to Thulin.

32:27.791 --> 32:28.791
Alone, please.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.333
Jesus, he's really irritating!

32:37.041 --> 32:38.166
Shall I send him home?

32:38.833 --> 32:39.958
I think he has talent.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.166
He's your problem then.

32:47.666 --> 32:50.416
Why didn't you back me up?

32:52.041 --> 32:53.125
If you're afraid--

32:53.208 --> 32:56.041
You'll be back in The Hague soon,
leaving me to clean up.

32:57.250 --> 33:00.000
Hi, Sebastian. Can we talk later--

33:00.083 --> 33:03.125
-Or it could be your reference for NC3.
-Thanks.

33:03.208 --> 33:05.708
I'm not the only one
who wants to get out of here.

33:06.416 --> 33:08.416
You don't know anything about me.

33:09.083 --> 33:09.916
Thulin.

33:10.875 --> 33:12.958
Erik Sejer-Lassen is in the meeting room.

33:20.625 --> 33:23.000
Sejer-Lassen… There's got to be something.

33:33.666 --> 33:38.875
Laura Kjær. Did Anne know her?
Did she talk about her perhaps?

33:40.583 --> 33:41.958
I don't think so.

33:43.625 --> 33:47.041
Was Anne afraid of anyone?
Did she have any enemies or…

33:47.666 --> 33:49.750
Anne just cared about the house and kids.

33:50.916 --> 33:52.541
Why was she trying to run off then?

33:54.041 --> 33:56.875
Your mother-in-law says
Anne was leaving you. Why's that?

34:00.958 --> 34:02.083
I had a few affairs.

34:02.875 --> 34:05.125
Did Anne know about them?

34:09.875 --> 34:13.000
-Yes.
-So she wanted to leave you?

34:14.041 --> 34:15.000
I presume so.

34:15.875 --> 34:18.791
She packed up the girls' stuff.
That seems a bit harsh.

34:23.125 --> 34:24.500
I've told you all I know.

34:26.541 --> 34:30.666
Our technician found dry blood residue
on your living room floor.

34:32.083 --> 34:33.333
Where did that come from?

34:34.666 --> 34:39.250
Our oldest daughter, Sofia, fell and broke
her nose and collarbone a few months ago.

34:39.333 --> 34:41.750
-She went to hospital.
-Which one?

34:43.333 --> 34:44.208
The central one.

34:44.291 --> 34:48.041
-Which ward?
-Pediatrics, I think? Anne dealt with it.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.375
That's where
Magnus Kjær was being assessed.

35:05.666 --> 35:07.291
Hi. We called you earlier.

35:07.375 --> 35:11.791
We've a few questions about two children
who were admitted to this ward.

35:11.875 --> 35:13.166
Who do we talk to?

35:13.250 --> 35:15.875
The consultant in charge.
He's doing rounds now.

35:15.958 --> 35:18.375
He can do that later. We're in a hurry.

35:18.458 --> 35:19.916
Can I help you?

35:20.000 --> 35:23.125
Nurses often know
the children better than the doctors.

35:23.208 --> 35:25.083
We'd like to speak to the consultant.

35:25.666 --> 35:28.458
If you wait down the hall,
I'll get him for you.

35:28.541 --> 35:29.375
Thank you.

35:33.458 --> 35:37.333
Magnus has been coming here
for assessments for about a year.

35:37.416 --> 35:43.500
Sofia was admitted with a simple fracture
after a fall at home a few months ago.

35:43.583 --> 35:46.750
Did the kids know each other?
Or perhaps the parents did?

35:46.833 --> 35:49.375
No. It seemed like
they didn't know each other.

35:49.458 --> 35:51.750
You need to understand something else…

35:53.458 --> 35:54.958
about this ward.

35:55.041 --> 36:00.000
-It's a gateway to other departments.
-Who brought the children in?

36:01.083 --> 36:03.333
As far as I recall, mainly the moms.

36:03.416 --> 36:05.875
You'll have to ask them to be sure.

36:06.916 --> 36:08.583
But I'm asking you.

36:08.666 --> 36:10.291
Yes, and I gave you my answer.

36:12.208 --> 36:14.250
I'm impressed you remember them.

36:14.958 --> 36:16.833
And their moms.

36:16.916 --> 36:22.333
Yes. One of the most important aspects
is making the parents feel safe.

36:22.416 --> 36:23.250
Of course.

36:23.958 --> 36:26.375
-So you knew the mothers quite well?
-Yes.

36:28.208 --> 36:29.291
What do you mean?

36:29.375 --> 36:30.583
Did you sleep with them?

36:33.541 --> 36:37.458
If that's your line of questioning,
I'd like to focus on the children.

36:37.541 --> 36:38.375
We're not done.

36:42.375 --> 36:45.833
Both mothers are dead.
You're the common denominator.

36:58.625 --> 37:01.208
I know Magnus' mom.

37:02.458 --> 37:04.250
She's the one I knew best

37:04.333 --> 37:08.083
as Magnus' assessment
for autism had been ongoing.

37:09.458 --> 37:12.083
She was frustrated
as nothing seemed to help.

37:12.166 --> 37:14.750
Then they suddenly stopped coming.

37:14.833 --> 37:15.833
Why?

37:16.916 --> 37:20.458
She said someone had reported her
and her son to social services.

37:20.541 --> 37:22.541
Reported for what?

37:24.125 --> 37:26.250
-Your patients are waiting.
-Let them wait--

37:26.333 --> 37:28.833
Wait!
There was a report to social services?

37:28.916 --> 37:32.041
I only know
what the mom said, but she said

37:32.125 --> 37:34.708
she was being accused
of neglecting Marcus.

37:34.791 --> 37:37.291
Did she mention who'd reported her?

37:37.375 --> 37:38.208
No.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.458
As far as I know, it was done anonymously.

37:43.208 --> 37:45.083
But she was a loving mother, so…

37:46.708 --> 37:47.583
So it's not true.

37:49.708 --> 37:52.416
Let's get
a copy of the social services report.

37:57.333 --> 38:00.625
The police say
that the person vandalizing your car

38:00.708 --> 38:02.833
is the same person who sent the threat.

38:02.916 --> 38:04.541
Even I could have guessed that!

38:05.958 --> 38:07.125
Who is he?

38:07.208 --> 38:10.583
The car was parked
in a blind spot from the CCTV,

38:10.666 --> 38:12.458
so they have no suspects.

38:12.541 --> 38:15.708
Rosa, the police
are now insisting on bodyguards.

38:16.833 --> 38:18.708
Okay, if there no way around it.

38:20.083 --> 38:22.291
But I'd like to tell my family myself.

38:22.916 --> 38:23.750
Of course.

38:25.375 --> 38:27.541
The PM was pleased with your TV interview.

38:27.625 --> 38:29.000
ANOTHER MURDER - SAME MURDERER?

38:29.083 --> 38:31.666
-Bukke would like a meeting.
-Nice.

38:31.750 --> 38:35.416
Especially, if we can agree on something.
Tell him to come over.

38:35.500 --> 38:36.666
-Yes.
-Thank you.

38:37.250 --> 38:41.583
The homicide investigator asked
to see you and your husband today.

38:41.666 --> 38:42.500
It's urgent.

38:53.916 --> 38:56.583
Thanks for coming. I'll keep it brief.<i>`</i>

38:56.666 --> 38:58.791
I know Rosa has a meeting.

39:02.166 --> 39:07.125
In connection with another murder,
we found another chestnut man.

39:08.958 --> 39:10.666
It also carries Kristine's prints.

39:11.666 --> 39:14.625
The victim is a woman. Anne Sejer-Lassen.

39:15.583 --> 39:16.416
Do you know her?

39:17.333 --> 39:18.166
No.

39:20.416 --> 39:23.416
They live in Klampenborg.
The husband's Erik Sejer-Lassen.

39:24.625 --> 39:26.583
We've just started our investigation,

39:26.666 --> 39:30.666
but it's probably a matter
of malicious harassment directed at you.

39:30.750 --> 39:34.333
-Why?
-That's what we'd like to know too.

39:35.791 --> 39:39.916
The intelligence services are assisting,
and I heard you'd received some threats.

39:41.708 --> 39:44.250
Nothing that'll keep me up at night.

39:44.333 --> 39:47.250
-Which threats?
-I'll tell you later.

39:47.333 --> 39:49.708
I understand how painful this is for you.

39:49.791 --> 39:52.791
And I promise you
we'll apprehend the person quickly.

39:52.875 --> 39:55.125
-So you're allowed some peace.
-Yes, please.

39:55.208 --> 39:56.041
I just need to…

39:57.458 --> 39:58.291
Yes?

40:00.041 --> 40:03.250
If you found her print again…

40:06.291 --> 40:07.666
Couldn't that mean…

40:09.541 --> 40:13.000
that Kristine might be alive?

40:16.125 --> 40:19.958
Steen, I'm afraid not.
Fingerprints can last for several years.

40:20.041 --> 40:23.666
This person could have gotten
the chestnuts a long time ago.

40:23.750 --> 40:25.958
But how can you be sure?

40:26.041 --> 40:29.958
It's hard to accept what happened,

40:30.041 --> 40:31.791
but it doesn't change a thing.

40:31.875 --> 40:32.708
I'm sorry.

40:36.333 --> 40:37.208
-Nylander?
-Yes.

40:37.916 --> 40:39.500
Please excuse me?

40:45.333 --> 40:47.458
I've been threatened twice.

40:47.541 --> 40:52.166
First by email and then with graffiti
on my car, but it's nothing.

40:52.958 --> 40:55.375
The police are placing
a bodyguard or two--

40:55.458 --> 40:56.333
Is it nothing?

40:57.625 --> 41:00.166
Two women were murdered.
You're being threatened.

41:00.250 --> 41:03.333
They have Kristine's prints.
What's going on?

41:03.416 --> 41:05.958
Rosa, I think the driver
would like to get going.

41:08.000 --> 41:08.875
Can't you cancel?

41:11.708 --> 41:13.916
Sorry, no. I'm meeting Bukke.

41:14.583 --> 41:15.416
I won't be late.

41:17.250 --> 41:19.000
-Thanks for coming.
-Not at all.

41:23.500 --> 41:25.541
-Yes.
-Thanks, Steen.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.333
SEARCH FOR KRISTINE HARTUNG ABANDONED

42:05.083 --> 42:07.083
POLICE SEARCHING FOREST

42:23.458 --> 42:25.041
No, everything's fine, Aksel.

42:25.125 --> 42:30.875
I went shopping for the lantern festival,
so I'll just see you at school. Bye.

42:37.000 --> 42:40.875
Social services received
an anonymous report regarding Laura Kjær.

42:40.958 --> 42:43.416
The sender wants to remove
the boy from his home.

42:45.083 --> 42:48.208
"The selfish whore thinks of herself
and not of the boy."

42:48.291 --> 42:49.458
"She should know better."

42:49.541 --> 42:52.291
It also says
that there is evidence in the home.

42:52.958 --> 42:55.458
-Okay. And what did they find?
-Nothing.

42:56.708 --> 42:58.375
And they've no idea who sent it?

42:59.666 --> 43:02.125
No, that's what "anonymous" means.

43:02.208 --> 43:06.250
-And Sejer-Lassen? Any reports on them?
-The social worker says no.

43:06.875 --> 43:08.791
Let's look at Laura Kjær's home again.

43:09.833 --> 43:12.125
All right, let's do that.

43:28.291 --> 43:31.500
I have to get back
before my daughter's lantern festival.

43:33.958 --> 43:35.708
Don't you have anyone waiting?

43:37.416 --> 43:40.541
I know you're married.
Maybe she kicked you out?

43:40.625 --> 43:43.000
I'll check the house.
You talk to the neighbors.

43:43.083 --> 43:46.291
-Sure.
-Somebody still reported Laura Kjær.

43:49.083 --> 43:49.916
Keys.

44:54.041 --> 44:56.750
-Hess?
-Did you find anything?

44:58.875 --> 45:00.916
The neighbors say the family's nice.

45:01.708 --> 45:05.625
Nobody saw anything that could cause
them to report them anonymously.

45:07.333 --> 45:08.416
No. All right.

45:09.291 --> 45:11.666
Go home to your son. I'll finish this.

45:12.458 --> 45:13.958
And I'll lock up when I leave.

45:16.583 --> 45:17.416
Sure.

45:22.833 --> 45:23.708
My son!

45:29.375 --> 45:30.625
<i>You called!</i>

45:30.708 --> 45:32.750
Hi, Sebastian. Are you still at work?

45:32.833 --> 45:36.250
<i>-Yes. What's up?</i>
<i>-</i>I just need to see someone sane.

45:47.375 --> 45:48.208
<i>Hi Thulin.</i>

45:48.291 --> 45:51.000
Would you ask Abildgård
to check a plate for me?

45:51.083 --> 45:54.791
<i>-Sure, go ahead.</i>
-BS 23 512.

45:55.500 --> 45:58.916
<i>He'll call you once he's run it.</i>
<i>What's this all about?</i>

45:59.000 --> 46:00.541
I don't know, but…

46:02.333 --> 46:05.458
-Just ask him to call me when he's done.
-<i>I will!</i>

48:49.416 --> 48:53.875
-Hi, I thought you were busy?
-I am. I need to leave in ten minutes.

48:54.833 --> 48:55.666
Well…

48:57.000 --> 48:59.916
-Okay.
-I was just thinking…

49:03.166 --> 49:04.833
I don't know what I was thinking.

49:23.333 --> 49:24.458
Do you need to answer?

49:27.541 --> 49:28.625
Abildgård, what's up?

51:51.083 --> 51:51.958
Hess?

52:15.000 --> 52:15.833
Police!

52:18.000 --> 52:18.833
Turn around.

52:19.333 --> 52:20.541
Now. Turn around!

52:24.708 --> 52:26.708
Hauge, what are you doing here?

52:27.333 --> 52:28.291
You can't be here.

52:28.791 --> 52:30.208
What are you doing here?

52:30.791 --> 52:33.375
Hey! Fuck!

52:41.000 --> 52:41.833
What was that?

52:42.916 --> 52:43.750
Where's Hess?

52:45.708 --> 52:46.708
Move it.

52:48.583 --> 52:49.416
Open it!

52:59.750 --> 53:00.583
Hess!

53:00.666 --> 53:01.750
Get the laptop.

54:46.541 --> 54:52.041
