16:15.341 --> 16:20.438
Mu Gamma Xi.

16:20.612 --> 16:25.982
Mu Gamma Xi.

16:38.430 --> 16:39.829
Mu.

16:40.566 --> 16:43.433
Mu Gamma Xi.
Mu Gamma Xi.

16:43.602 --> 16:47.595
We are the outstanding brothers
of Mu Gamma Xi.

16:47.773 --> 16:51.573
We rep where we go
till the day that we die.

16:53.579 --> 16:56.980
Get off my back.
Get off my back.

17:00.486 --> 17:02.283
Mu Gamma.

17:02.755 --> 17:05.416
Mu Gamma, Mu, Mu, Mu.

17:18.804 --> 17:20.328
Yo, Craig.

17:21.339 --> 17:24.798
Mu Gamma Xi.
Mu Gamma Xi.

17:31.950 --> 17:35.442
You must think you're Superman,
thinking you can come upstage us.

17:35.621 --> 17:37.680
This is how you wanna
start the weekend?

17:37.856 --> 17:40.552
-CouIdn't wait tiII Sunday, Taz?
-That's how I feeI.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.887
Face it, Dane, you're gonna Iose.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.053
You're gonna Iose huge.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.357
Yeah. It's been two years.

17:47.533 --> 17:50.798
When you graduate, they're
gonna remember you as a faiIure.

17:50.969 --> 17:54.336
Yo, Taz. Taz.

17:54.506 --> 17:56.633
-What you gonna beat us with, man?
-Hey.

17:56.809 --> 17:58.140
-HoId your Iine.
-Threats?

17:58.310 --> 18:00.710
Yeah, Chance, hoId your Iine.

18:01.747 --> 18:04.477
That's your new mascot, right?
Is that who that is?

18:04.650 --> 18:06.049
Oh, the Rock Star, huh?

18:06.985 --> 18:09.180
We've heard him speak.
He do other tricks?

18:09.354 --> 18:11.720
Yo, I got your trick. You want--?

18:11.890 --> 18:13.050
You need to caIm down.

18:13.225 --> 18:14.852
-CaIm down.
-Oh, he gets mad.

18:15.027 --> 18:16.858
You need to be cooI.

18:17.596 --> 18:19.325
Steady, steady. Y'aII be cooI.

18:19.498 --> 18:20.556
-ReIax.
-No, be cooI.

18:20.732 --> 18:22.859
-Ease up.
-He gets mad, huh?

18:23.035 --> 18:24.366
-There we go.
-Be cooI.

18:24.736 --> 18:25.998
-M-U!
-Gamma Xi!

18:26.171 --> 18:27.502
-M-U!
-Gamma Xi!

18:27.673 --> 18:29.038
-M-U!
-Gamma Xi!

18:37.082 --> 18:37.282
Come on, man.

18:37.282 --> 18:39.250
Come on, man.

19:09.882 --> 19:12.874
Theta what?
Theta Nu.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.720
I Iove this!

19:17.756 --> 19:19.917
Show-stopping.

19:20.926 --> 19:23.622
I can't wait to win
one of these bad boys on Sunday.

19:23.795 --> 19:26.093
Whoa, whoa, whoa, man.
Put this thing down.

19:27.032 --> 19:28.932
We gonna have one
soon enough, kid.

19:29.101 --> 19:30.796
-Yes, yes, yes.
-Soon enough.

19:30.969 --> 19:33.631
-Yo, I'm not so sure.
-What?

19:33.805 --> 19:36.638
There's a reason
why we haven't won one since then.

19:36.808 --> 19:38.070
Mus were better tonight.

19:38.243 --> 19:40.404
I mean,
they had some hot moves, man.

19:40.579 --> 19:41.944
They did.

19:42.381 --> 19:45.908
If we don't step our game up,
we're gonna get destroyed on Sunday.

19:46.318 --> 19:49.116
We can say goodbye
to the schoIarship and the money.

19:49.288 --> 19:51.518
Don't know about y'aII,
but I couId use it.

19:51.690 --> 19:55.683
Tuition is crazy, but no way we're
gonna get Dane to change the routine.

19:56.161 --> 19:57.753
But why not?

19:58.330 --> 20:00.798
Why not? I mean, think about it.

20:00.966 --> 20:05.027
Theta's been doing the same routine
since before I Ieft Truth Iast year.

20:05.204 --> 20:08.935
-I can come up with something better.
-ReaIIy, Chance? ReaIIy?

20:09.107 --> 20:11.871
We just got the frat. We just got in--

20:13.378 --> 20:15.812
Hey, Roy, what's going on, man?

20:17.149 --> 20:19.982
We just got into the frat.
You wanna rock the boat?

20:20.152 --> 20:23.485
Come on, man, that's not a good Iook.
It's not. It's not.

20:23.655 --> 20:27.614
One thing's for sure, we're gonna Iose
if you keep stepping on my feet.

20:27.793 --> 20:29.124
Man, forget aII of that.

20:29.294 --> 20:31.421
TeII Nikki to hook us up
with her sorors.

20:31.597 --> 20:34.464
-Pass the baII. Pass the baII.
-No. I'II be right back.

20:34.633 --> 20:36.658
-Come on, stop being greedy.
-Jeez.

20:37.536 --> 20:38.560
Theta what?

20:38.737 --> 20:40.864
-Theta Nu.
-Theta Nu.

20:41.940 --> 20:44.238
-What's up, baby?
-Come here, baby.

20:46.645 --> 20:47.839
I can't stick around...

20:48.013 --> 20:50.811
...because I gotta check on the fIoats
for homecoming.

20:50.983 --> 20:55.647
But I wanted to say congratuIations.
You were amazing.

20:55.821 --> 20:57.345
WeII, I do what I can do.

20:57.522 --> 21:00.389
AII right, aII right,
don't get aII gassed.

21:03.862 --> 21:06.296
I'II see you Iater, right?

21:06.832 --> 21:08.959
Of course.

21:13.205 --> 21:14.229
Okay.

21:14.406 --> 21:16.271
-Let's go.
-AII right.

21:18.310 --> 21:21.609
Hey, can I taIk to you for a second?

21:26.652 --> 21:28.142
What's up?

21:30.289 --> 21:33.281
What happened at the pep raIIy earIier
was unacceptabIe.

21:33.458 --> 21:34.823
And I think you know that.

21:34.993 --> 21:37.894
I wasn't gonna stand back
and watch Taz disrespect us.

21:38.063 --> 21:41.794
But what you did was disrespectfuI
to me and to the frat.

21:41.967 --> 21:45.698
Look, Chance, you're a Theta now,
and we expect a Iot more from you.

21:45.871 --> 21:48.635
BeIieve me, nobody wants
to outdo Taz more than I do.

21:49.741 --> 21:51.800
You Iet me handIe him. Understand?

21:52.778 --> 21:53.938
My man.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.573
-Fellas, keep form.
-All right.

22:04.156 --> 22:07.592
I wanna hear it. I wanna hear it.

22:13.665 --> 22:15.758
Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me?

22:15.934 --> 22:17.265
That's aII you got?

22:18.236 --> 22:20.227
-I'm trying.
-Not trying hard enough.

22:20.405 --> 22:24.136
We have untiI Sunday, you guys,
to get that routine together. Okay?

22:24.710 --> 22:27.338
Or we're gonna Iose.
Is that what you want?

22:27.512 --> 22:30.447
-We're gonna Iose anyway.
-I'm sorry, you say something?

22:30.615 --> 22:32.310
I didn't hear you.

22:32.484 --> 22:36.682
You got something to say?
Do you have something to say, neo?

22:37.556 --> 22:41.287
-The Mus were dope the other night.
-I don't give a damn about the Mus.

22:41.460 --> 22:44.361
If you have a point, damn it,
you better make it.

22:47.399 --> 22:50.857
Look, a few of us was thinking
that maybe...

22:51.036 --> 22:53.266
...we shouId step our game up
a IittIe bit.

22:53.438 --> 22:56.669
-We doing the stuff from Iast year.
-So now what?

22:57.809 --> 23:00.676
-Maybe I shouId just show you.
-Yeah, maybe you shouId.

23:09.755 --> 23:12.053
Dane. Dane,
we don't got time for this, man.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.452
No, no, be cooI, boy.

23:13.625 --> 23:16.560
Let the boy have the fIoor.
Let's see what he's made of.

23:56.735 --> 23:57.759
AII right.

24:02.441 --> 24:06.070
We couId stiII incorporate
the same moves from our Iast routine...

24:06.611 --> 24:09.637
...but it doesn't hurt
to have a ace up our sIeeves.

24:15.987 --> 24:19.354
For those of you who wanna
incorporate Chance's choreography...

24:19.524 --> 24:21.924
...into the routine, raise your hands.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.664
Looks Iike you guys
better get started.

24:31.069 --> 24:33.697
-Yeah, thank you. AII right.
-Oh, yeah.

24:33.872 --> 24:36.204
You gonna put our fate
in the hands of a neo?

24:36.374 --> 24:38.467
I'II be damned if I Iet Taz win this.

24:39.244 --> 24:41.769
Maybe he can give us the edge
that we need.

24:41.947 --> 24:43.642
That's aII I'm saying.

24:43.815 --> 24:45.612
I hope you're right.

24:45.784 --> 24:47.183
Yes, yes, yes.

24:47.352 --> 24:49.684
Show me what you got there, man.
That's it.

24:49.855 --> 24:53.052
I didn't caII a break.
You got a routine, you better show it.

24:53.225 --> 24:55.489
-AII right.
-So Iet's go, Iet's go.

25:06.905 --> 25:09.396
-Morning, Terry.
-Hey, Shorty.

25:10.775 --> 25:13.141
-Chance in yet?
-Course not.

25:15.914 --> 25:19.611
One more time. Wynn, stay with me.
Remember that right Ieg.

25:21.486 --> 25:25.320
AII right, y'aII, one more time.
DaredeviI, I see you. Right Ieg.

25:28.260 --> 25:31.286
-One more time. AII right, come on.
-No, no, no.

25:31.463 --> 25:32.987
That's enough, that's enough.

25:34.833 --> 25:36.664
Yo, so good job.

25:37.269 --> 25:41.672
I admit it stiII needs a IittIe bit of work.
Don't think this gets you off the hook.

25:41.840 --> 25:44.206
StiII have community service
this afternoon.

25:44.376 --> 25:45.968
On homecoming weekend?
Come on.

25:46.144 --> 25:48.612
-Thought it was aII about stepping?
-And girIs.

25:48.780 --> 25:51.112
Learn to step,
get as many girIs as you want.

25:51.283 --> 25:53.615
Come on, Iet's go. I'II see y'aII Iater.

25:54.286 --> 25:56.914
-Yo, what time is it?
-It's 1 1 :00.

25:57.088 --> 25:59.921
Damn. I gotta go.

26:01.059 --> 26:03.186
-Good morning, come on in.
-Good morning.

26:03.361 --> 26:05.420
Janice. AII right.

26:05.597 --> 26:07.827
Nice to see you. Good morning.

26:07.999 --> 26:10.991
Come in. I don't even wanna hear it.
Come on. Get ready.

26:11.169 --> 26:14.332
Dad, practice ran over. I'm sorry.

26:14.506 --> 26:18.067
-Dad, I said I was sorry.
-Look, Chance, I don't wanna hear it.

26:18.243 --> 26:22.179
I aIready toId you how important this
weekend is, didn't I? Just get ready.

26:37.495 --> 26:39.520
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

26:40.131 --> 26:41.826
You guys enjoy.

27:00.218 --> 27:04.177
Chance, my office, now.

27:11.830 --> 27:13.422
Sit down.

27:14.833 --> 27:16.198
Look...

27:17.769 --> 27:20.465
...you didn't re-enroII in Truth
just to sIack off.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.072
SIack off?

27:23.975 --> 27:27.467
I'm here every day
trying to heIp you out.

27:28.346 --> 27:31.110
I'm entering the show
so I can win schoIarship money.

27:31.282 --> 27:34.149
That frat is not a priority.

27:37.956 --> 27:39.446
Look...

27:40.058 --> 27:41.491
...when your mom died...

27:41.660 --> 27:44.720
...you ran out of here
with no money and no pIan.

27:44.896 --> 27:46.955
You Ieft me
to handIe this restaurant.

27:47.332 --> 27:50.995
Now that you're back home, I wanna
see you take some responsibiIity...

27:51.169 --> 27:53.137
...to see this thing through.

27:53.304 --> 27:55.534
I'm not trying to run your Iife.

27:55.707 --> 27:58.232
I've aIways tried
to be supportive of you.

27:58.977 --> 28:01.138
Now I need you
to be supportive of me.

28:18.763 --> 28:20.196
-Pi.
-Delta.

28:20.732 --> 28:23.929
Pi Delta Mu step.

28:24.869 --> 28:28.930
I gotta admit, man, your girI
is getting it in right now, Chance.

28:29.107 --> 28:30.802
She Iooking kind of fIy too.

28:30.975 --> 28:34.103
AII these fIy honeys here,
and you gotta check out my girI.

28:34.279 --> 28:37.476
What's the matter, man?
You worried about aII this big Wynn?

28:37.649 --> 28:40.709
Don't do that. And I'm good.
I ain't worried about nothing.

28:42.120 --> 28:44.213
-Come on.
-Maybe you shouId, dude.

28:44.522 --> 28:47.320
-Homewrecker, 7 o'cIock.
-Hi.

28:48.860 --> 28:49.986
Man, you better run.

28:50.161 --> 28:54.154
We are the Pi DeIta Mus, and not onIy
are we smart and beautifuI...

28:54.632 --> 28:57.692
...we aIso know
how to get down and dirty.

28:57.869 --> 29:01.202
My girIs are about to show you
something y'aII need to see.

29:01.372 --> 29:04.466
-Pi Delta Mu step.
-Chance.

29:04.642 --> 29:07.577
Pi Delta Mu step.

29:07.746 --> 29:11.147
Pi Delta Mu step.

29:11.316 --> 29:13.113
Aren't you happy to see me?

29:13.284 --> 29:15.878
Slow it down.

29:16.287 --> 29:17.652
Come on.

29:17.822 --> 29:20.586
-Get it, girIs.
-She's cuter than Iast year.

29:20.759 --> 29:23.421
-Is it serious?
-What do you want, Brenda?

29:29.834 --> 29:30.926
I don't know.

29:31.102 --> 29:34.902
You're just kind of on my mind.
I never got a chance to expIain myseIf.

29:35.073 --> 29:38.338
Hey, hey, hey.

29:39.811 --> 29:41.676
It's been a year.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.408
Why now?

29:45.617 --> 29:48.381
Because it's not the same
without you.

29:49.754 --> 29:51.585
I kind of miss you and me.

29:52.190 --> 29:53.680
You know...

29:54.159 --> 29:56.525
...me and you did have
some good times.

30:04.502 --> 30:05.799
Wasn't aII easy saiIing.

30:07.238 --> 30:09.866
You see,
when I needed you the most...

30:10.775 --> 30:12.640
...you wasn't even there.

30:14.512 --> 30:17.447
Too busy hooking up with Taz
to notice.

30:18.349 --> 30:21.284
I deserve that. I do.

30:22.420 --> 30:26.220
But when your mom died,
you shut me out.

30:26.391 --> 30:29.918
And then you transferred schooIs
in FIorida.

30:30.795 --> 30:32.786
What was I supposed to do?

30:33.364 --> 30:35.798
You know,
you're a reaI piece of work.

30:35.967 --> 30:38.492
Everybody makes mistakes,
Chance.

30:40.471 --> 30:42.666
Same number, right?

30:49.848 --> 30:52.316
-Hey, babe.
-Hey.

30:52.483 --> 30:54.781
-Did you see us?
-You guys did good.

30:54.953 --> 30:55.977
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

30:56.154 --> 30:57.519
-How good?
-ReaI good.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.554
-Proud?
-ReaI proud. Let's go, baby.

30:59.724 --> 31:01.157
Okay.

31:02.894 --> 31:04.862
CouId you just drop me
at the stadium?

31:05.029 --> 31:07.224
I gotta check on some stuff
for the game.

31:07.398 --> 31:10.094
Of course.
I was on the way to Ashby anyway.

31:10.268 --> 31:11.826
Ashby? For what?

31:12.003 --> 31:15.029
I got a IittIe community-service gig.

31:16.975 --> 31:19.273
AII the neos have to do it.

31:19.444 --> 31:22.140
Look at you, getting invoIved.

31:22.313 --> 31:24.781
I thought you were too cooI for that.

31:41.499 --> 31:42.989
Chance.

31:44.469 --> 31:46.369
Yo, man, watch it.

31:46.537 --> 31:48.971
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

31:49.140 --> 31:54.510
-Nothing? You aImost ran a stop sign.
-Look, reIax, okay?

31:54.679 --> 31:57.239
I'm just a IittIe nervous, baby.
That's it.

31:58.650 --> 32:00.140
Okay?

32:01.085 --> 32:05.021
Now, Iet's get out of here.
If I'm Iate, I have to hear from Dane.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.865
I must say, man, the way you got
at Dane this morning...

32:15.033 --> 32:17.092
...that was kind of gangster, man.

32:17.268 --> 32:19.600
Now you're just gonna have to
foIIow through.

32:20.071 --> 32:24.405
-What's that supposed to mean?
-You got Dane to change the routine.

32:24.575 --> 32:26.770
That's big. Just think about it.

32:26.945 --> 32:30.711
If we win on Sunday,
oh, we be Iiving Iegends, man.

32:42.794 --> 32:43.920
WeII, weII...

32:44.462 --> 32:48.091
...if it isn't the Thetas' new mascot
and his sidekick, OId YeIIer.

32:48.266 --> 32:51.895
I know you ain't taIking
with aII that possum around your neck.

32:52.070 --> 32:54.800
You know what?
Your jokes couId use an upgrade.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.440
They're getting kind of oId.

32:56.607 --> 32:58.905
Yeah, kind of Iike them dance steps

32:59.077 --> 33:02.979
You spit a good game at the raIIy,
but I hope you can back that up.

33:03.381 --> 33:05.906
Last night was just a taste
of what I'm bringing.

33:06.250 --> 33:07.842
When it's aII said and done...

33:08.019 --> 33:11.045
...we'II see who waIks away
with the trophy and the money.

33:11.489 --> 33:12.581
Me.

33:12.757 --> 33:15.783
Trophy on one arm
and your girI on the next.

33:16.527 --> 33:20.964
Because she'II reaIize you're a sucker,
kind of Iike Brenda did.

33:21.132 --> 33:23.396
It sucks, but these things happen,
you know?

33:23.568 --> 33:26.230
-You see that?
-Yeah.

33:27.038 --> 33:29.563
You taIking about that Brenda?
Oh, wait, wait.

33:29.741 --> 33:30.935
-Now, that sucks.
-Hey.

33:31.109 --> 33:35.478
-It ain't worth it.
-That sucks. It does. Sucks.

33:36.247 --> 33:38.647
Now we gonna get back to work.

33:38.816 --> 33:40.613

34:48.018 --> 34:50.987

34:51.155 --> 34:52.417

35:05.036 --> 35:06.526

35:19.884 --> 35:22.876
Oh, my bad. I mean,

35:23.054 --> 35:25.682
I just figured he might need a chance
to warm up.

35:25.857 --> 35:27.848
-Is that right?
-Yeah, that's right.

35:28.392 --> 35:30.360

35:33.898 --> 35:37.595
But, you know, whenever you're ready

35:41.606 --> 35:43.233
-I think I'm ready now.
-Chance.

35:43.407 --> 35:44.874
-No, no, no. Let's go.
-Yeah.

35:45.042 --> 35:46.634
You're gonna do this now?

35:46.811 --> 35:50.008
HoId up. I'm seeing

35:50.181 --> 35:52.649

37:12.563 --> 37:15.657

37:29.280 --> 37:30.872
-I mean, come on.
-Man.

37:31.048 --> 37:32.345

37:36.854 --> 37:39.345
-Don't Iook over here.
-Sorry, my bad.

37:40.858 --> 37:44.385
Chance, what are you trying to prove?
God, you are kiIIing me.

37:44.562 --> 37:45.688
Check it out.

37:45.863 --> 37:47.854
We aII have to be on that stage
Sunday.

37:48.032 --> 37:49.761
Take your revenge out there.

37:51.035 --> 37:52.400
Get in the car.

38:08.019 --> 38:09.919
I Ieft my sweater inside.

38:10.087 --> 38:13.056
Honey, did you see
how they was dancing at that party?

38:13.224 --> 38:16.022
-This day, I can't even deaI.
-ReaIIy.

38:16.193 --> 38:19.128
Why you didn't teII me
my eyebrows was Iooking crazy?

38:20.965 --> 38:22.956
I need serious tweezing.

38:23.134 --> 38:25.193
-It's Wynn.
-Serious tweezing, honey.

38:28.205 --> 38:31.936
Look your phone ain't here, aII right?
What was your deaI earIier, man?

38:32.109 --> 38:34.407
It'd be nice if you'd think of the frat...

38:34.578 --> 38:37.376
...before you show
how to make us aII Iook crazy.

38:43.354 --> 38:47.347
-Honey, what is it?
-Text from Brenda.

38:47.525 --> 38:48.753
Oh, heII, no, Nikki.

38:48.926 --> 38:52.487
-Like, for reaI, caII her right now.
-Rena, I'm not gonna caII her.

38:57.201 --> 38:59.294
-One more time.
-Your phone is not here.

38:59.470 --> 39:03.236
-And I promise this is it.
-Yo, your girI's outside.

39:11.716 --> 39:12.944
You found my phone.

39:13.117 --> 39:16.575
That's why you my--

39:19.290 --> 39:20.985
What's wrong?

39:22.393 --> 39:24.190
Who were you tonight?

39:24.995 --> 39:29.455
-Because it's not the Chance I know.
-Look, I know. And I'm sorry.

39:31.736 --> 39:35.832
I guess it's true what they say.
You never reaIIy know a person, huh?

39:36.674 --> 39:41.236
I mean, baby,
it's reaIIy not that serious, okay? I--

39:41.412 --> 39:44.381
Chance, you toId me
you were over Brenda.

39:48.686 --> 39:51.655
Look, how many times
do I have to teII you?

39:51.822 --> 39:55.155
I'm not thinking about that girI.
I want nothing to do with her.

39:55.326 --> 39:58.318
I saw the texts, Chance.

40:06.637 --> 40:08.696
You're saying
you went through my phone?

40:08.873 --> 40:11.467
-You Iied to me.
-I didn't Iie to you.

40:11.642 --> 40:14.873
Brenda pushed up on me.
And I toId her--

40:15.045 --> 40:18.173
ToId her what, Chance?
You toId her no?

40:19.550 --> 40:21.541
Or maybe?

40:24.655 --> 40:26.213
Know what?

40:26.557 --> 40:28.821
-Maybe I'm not good enough for you.
-Don't--

40:28.993 --> 40:32.326
No, no, no. Because ever since
day one, you never trusted me.

40:32.496 --> 40:33.963
Don't you dare.

40:34.131 --> 40:37.692
Don't you dare turn this around on me,
because this is about you.

40:37.868 --> 40:40.735
Your inabiIity to make a decision
about what you want.

40:40.905 --> 40:45.433
You're the new hot thing on campus
and everybody wants a piece, right?

40:47.044 --> 40:50.844
WeII, I refuse to pIay second fiddIe
to any girI.

40:53.717 --> 40:55.344
I'm sorry.

41:00.658 --> 41:04.219
Look, I don't know what eIse to say.

41:39.830 --> 41:42.230
-HeIIo?
-You busy?

41:44.935 --> 41:46.334
No. Why?

41:47.137 --> 41:49.571
I was thinking
we couId have that conversation.

41:50.007 --> 41:51.998
/n person.

41:53.444 --> 41:56.140
-Where's Taz?
-Where's Nikki?

41:56.847 --> 41:58.314
/'m outside.

42:01.919 --> 42:04.683
Don't you ever wonder
what that wouId be Iike?

42:06.257 --> 42:08.350
If you hadn't Ieft?

42:15.633 --> 42:17.294
It's a party, y'aII.

42:17.468 --> 42:18.958

42:20.771 --> 42:22.170

42:23.374 --> 42:25.205

42:25.376 --> 42:28.004
-Yeah, what's up?
-I was Iooking for Chance.

42:33.651 --> 42:34.675

42:36.554 --> 42:38.647

42:44.762 --> 42:48.459

42:49.567 --> 42:52.127

43:10.754 --> 43:12.745

What's the matter?

43:58.902 --> 44:00.767
I can't do this.

44:00.938 --> 44:04.032
-This ain't right.
-You know what?

44:04.608 --> 44:06.337
You can...

44:06.510 --> 44:08.842
...because it is right...

44:09.013 --> 44:10.947
...and easy.

44:11.115 --> 44:12.309

44:13.917 --> 44:15.817
...everything you Iike.

44:18.956 --> 44:20.389

44:27.464 --> 44:29.455

44:29.633 --> 44:31.396

44:36.340 --> 44:38.672
What happened?
Yo, Wynn, you okay?

44:38.842 --> 44:40.309
Yeah, I'm aII right.

44:40.477 --> 44:44.174
I'm on my way to the hospitaI now.
I sure hope that doctor's cute.

44:44.348 --> 44:46.680
These guys came to the house
Iooking for you.

44:46.850 --> 44:49.148
You have any idea who they were?

44:50.954 --> 44:53.149
How the heII wouId I know?
I wasn't here.

44:53.724 --> 44:56.352
ReaIIy? Because they came
asking for you by name.

45:00.364 --> 45:02.889
Why the heII wouId somebody
wanna come after you?

45:03.067 --> 45:05.558
Man, I don't know.
But it couId've been anybody.

45:05.736 --> 45:09.001
-ProbabIy one of Taz's boys.
-These cats were straight hood.

45:09.473 --> 45:11.441
-Straight up.
-Yeah.

45:14.845 --> 45:18.747
Yeah, he Iied about it, but I kind
of think you overreacted a IittIe bit.

45:19.483 --> 45:22.782
You know Brenda. I honestIy think
she's just chasing after him.

45:22.953 --> 45:26.116
-WeII, he's not running.
-That don't mean he did anything.

45:26.290 --> 45:29.157
Come on. You seen her
at that party the other night.

45:29.326 --> 45:32.989
She was jocking him kind of hard.
And I'm Ietting you know now...

45:33.163 --> 45:35.791
...it ain't the first time
and won't be the Iast.

45:35.966 --> 45:38.332
Why'd he Iie
if he wasn't doing anything wrong?

45:38.502 --> 45:43.303
Because he's a man, sweet cakes.
That's just what men do.

45:43.941 --> 45:45.670
AII right, Iook.

45:46.143 --> 45:48.236
Give it some time...

45:48.412 --> 45:52.610
...see how the weekend goes,
and he'II come around.

45:55.452 --> 45:57.420
I trust you.

45:57.588 --> 45:59.351
Cheers.

46:08.232 --> 46:10.894
Yo, Rock Star.

46:13.804 --> 46:15.772
-AII right?
-Yeah, fine.

46:15.939 --> 46:18.271
You shouId see him, though,
you know?

46:19.977 --> 46:21.342
What's up?

46:24.081 --> 46:25.844
Have to teII you something.

46:27.885 --> 46:31.412
CoupIe of weeks ago,
I got hustIed at a dance battIe.

46:33.724 --> 46:35.419
Now they're gunning for me.

46:37.060 --> 46:42.225
Are you trying to teII me that this...

46:44.001 --> 46:45.935
...is because of you?

46:49.406 --> 46:51.135
So why didn't you say anything?

46:54.311 --> 46:55.835
I don't know.

46:56.013 --> 46:59.949
I guess-- I guess I was scared
to get kicked off the team.

47:00.717 --> 47:03.811
I reaIIy, reaIIy needed to win
this competition.

47:03.987 --> 47:07.388
Are you serious?
That's what you're worried about?

47:08.458 --> 47:12.258
I mean, you've aIways been
kind of seIfish, but this is ridicuIous.

47:12.663 --> 47:14.631
Something about you changed.

47:14.798 --> 47:18.097
My whoIe Iife has changed.
Ever since my mom died, I--

47:18.268 --> 47:20.566
Don't put this on your mother.

47:21.171 --> 47:22.729
Don't.

47:23.974 --> 47:28.638
Everything has aIways been
about Chance Harris.

47:28.812 --> 47:31.280
And it's been that way
since we were IittIe.

47:35.052 --> 47:36.849
I'm your boy, Chance.

47:38.889 --> 47:40.982
You shouId've come to me.

48:56.333 --> 48:58.494
-Hey.
-Hey, girI.

48:58.669 --> 49:02.400
So I heard there was, Iike, a huge fight
at the Theta house Iast night.

49:07.144 --> 49:11.513
The IittIe dude you was dancing with
at the cIub Iast night, where he at?

49:13.150 --> 49:14.879
Do I know you?

49:15.953 --> 49:19.912
I reaIIy thought you coIIege boys
was a IittIe bit smarter than that.

49:22.192 --> 49:25.059
-Answer the damn question.
-What you want with him?

49:25.228 --> 49:28.391
-Anybody hurt?
-Wynn got himseIf beat up.

49:31.768 --> 49:33.759
It reaIIy ain't none of your business.

49:36.073 --> 49:37.597
But Iet's just say he owe me.

49:39.176 --> 49:41.576
-What about Chance?
-I don't know.

49:44.815 --> 49:46.806
You Iike catfish?

49:51.922 --> 49:53.947

49:54.124 --> 49:57.560

resting up.

49:58.662 --> 50:02.325
And miss my first game as a Theta?
Come on, man.

50:04.668 --> 50:09.503
I thought it'd be nice

50:15.512 --> 50:17.639
PIus it's hard

50:17.814 --> 50:19.145

50:46.143 --> 50:49.374
Don't ruin your homecoming weekend
pining over some guy.

50:49.546 --> 50:52.777
-It screams desperation.
-You're the one that has me worried.

50:52.949 --> 50:54.849
You toId me

50:55.018 --> 50:57.179
Don't worry about Chance. He's fine.

50:57.354 --> 50:59.447
-Excuse me?
-He's fine.

50:59.623 --> 51:03.081
It's a good thing he wasn't at
the house when the fight went down.

51:03.260 --> 51:06.286
-And how do you know that?
-Because he was with me.

51:15.105 --> 51:19.098
Why you Iet that girI get to you? She

51:19.276 --> 51:21.744

-Where's my money, Chance?
-Look, I don't owe you no money.

52:38.588 --> 52:40.488
I toId you that. You know this.

52:42.626 --> 52:44.856
You pIayed in the streets.

to you guys about.

55:47.077 --> 55:49.136
Yo, what you taIking about?

55:54.317 --> 55:58.845
A few weeks ago, I got hustIed
at a dance battIe, 5 grand.

56:01.791 --> 56:05.488
So everything that happened Iast night
was because of me.

56:06.629 --> 56:09.996
They're gonna come after me
if I don't throw the competition.

56:11.434 --> 56:15.302
Look, I never meant to get you guys
invoIved in this mess, and I'm sorry.

56:16.072 --> 56:17.471
EspeciaIIy to you, Wynn.

56:19.743 --> 56:23.042
And you never thought
to say something before?

56:23.213 --> 56:26.273
-Maybe we couId've done something.
-Like what?

56:26.449 --> 56:30.044
Pay them off? Fight them?
No, I'm good.

56:31.054 --> 56:34.182
-HandIe it myseIf.
-You don't have that choice, Chance.

56:34.657 --> 56:38.525
Wynn is hurt, and we're supposed
to go out and Iose to save your ass?

56:38.695 --> 56:41.289
No. I never intended
on throwing the competition.

56:41.464 --> 56:44.399
I understand how important
this competition is to you.

56:44.567 --> 56:46.899
Chance, it's not about me.

56:47.437 --> 56:48.734
It's about the team.

56:59.416 --> 57:02.408
I can see how much damage
I've caused here.

57:02.886 --> 57:04.979
I've done more harm than good.

57:05.155 --> 57:09.353
-Maybe I shouId just quit.
-We don't need him. Never did.

57:09.526 --> 57:12.495
Listen, we changed the entire routine
because of you.

57:12.662 --> 57:14.653
There's no way
you can do this to us.

57:14.831 --> 57:16.890
Dane, teII him
he doesn't have to Ieave.

57:17.066 --> 57:18.624
I got it.

57:20.236 --> 57:22.363
Rock Star, hoId up.

57:26.342 --> 57:29.470
Now, emotions are cIearIy high
right now.

57:32.348 --> 57:35.715
So I gotta Iet the brother
do what he's gotta do, period.

57:37.287 --> 57:39.118
It's another day.

57:39.622 --> 57:41.783
And y'aII are stiII famiIy.

57:44.661 --> 57:45.958
That's what matters.

57:48.264 --> 57:51.358
-Theta what?
-Theta Nu.

57:51.534 --> 57:52.762
There it is.

57:53.536 --> 57:56.061
Keep your head up, brother.
AII right, y'aII.

57:56.239 --> 57:58.230
-DJ, be good, man.
-Peace out.

57:58.441 --> 58:00.375
-Yo.
-AII right.

58:39.782 --> 58:41.147
Figured I'd find you here.

58:42.952 --> 58:46.115
I caught Wynn and Dane
on their way to practice.

58:46.289 --> 58:47.756
They toId me everything.

58:49.259 --> 58:51.284
I came to see if you were okay.

58:53.930 --> 58:55.488
I'm good.

58:59.402 --> 59:02.803
WeII, why aren't you at practice?

59:03.640 --> 59:07.041
Because I just can't do
the competition right now.

59:07.443 --> 59:11.846
What you mean
is you don't want to do this right now.

59:12.015 --> 59:14.449
I reaIIy do care about you.

59:15.718 --> 59:17.652
And I'm not the onIy one.

59:17.820 --> 59:20.288
But that doesn't seem
to mean anything to you.

59:20.456 --> 59:24.222
-Come on, Nikki. That's not even fair.
-Not fair is turning your back...

59:24.394 --> 59:28.854
-...on peopIe that beIieved in you.
-I don't wanna Iose you, okay?

59:29.566 --> 59:32.831
-I don't wanna Iose you.
-Then don't.

59:51.821 --> 59:54.346
Come on, y'aII,

Now, I know a Iot has happened
in the Iast coupIe days.

01:00:06.636 --> 01:00:09.605
We can't worry about that now.
We worry about who's here.

01:00:09.772 --> 01:00:13.708
Don't worry about who's not. Who's on
this roof, that's what's important.

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:17.409
I'm gonna teII you right now,
this competition stiII matters.

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:20.708
Now, I'm hard on you guys

01:00:20.883 --> 01:00:22.350
I need you guys to focus.

01:00:22.518 --> 01:00:25.749

I know.

01:07:29.178 --> 01:07:30.645
At Ieast nobody got hurt.

01:07:32.248 --> 01:07:34.614
You know,
I'm worried about you, son.

01:07:35.418 --> 01:07:39.548
I know I was pretty hard on you
Iast night, but we aII make mistakes.

01:07:39.722 --> 01:07:43.089
Part of being a man is owning up
to your mistakes.

01:07:46.629 --> 01:07:49.291
I didn't know how to be there for you.

01:07:51.634 --> 01:07:55.035
The onIy thing I knew how to do
was work, and that's what I did.

01:07:55.604 --> 01:07:57.401
And I was wrong.

01:07:57.706 --> 01:07:59.697
I don't ever wanna
push you away again.

01:07:59.875 --> 01:08:03.675
You have the right to choose
your own path whether I Iike it or not.

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:08.842
And I need you to know
and feeI comfortabIe to come to me...

01:08:09.718 --> 01:08:11.208
...with whatever you need.

01:08:18.294 --> 01:08:19.693
You're aII I have Ieft.

01:08:20.662 --> 01:08:22.493
That's exactIy why I came back.

01:08:22.865 --> 01:08:26.562
I beIong here,
and I ain't going anywhere.

01:08:28.203 --> 01:08:29.569
Not again.

01:08:33.408 --> 01:08:36.139
I stiII got so much to fix.

01:08:36.679 --> 01:08:39.238
I gotta pay these guys,
make things up to Nikki.

01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:44.185
-I don't even know where to start.
-You might start with that competition.

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:47.011
Since when do you care
about the competition?

01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:49.657
I don't care about the competition.

01:08:50.626 --> 01:08:52.389
I care about my son.

01:08:54.697 --> 01:08:57.063
Do you care enough
to come watch me?

01:08:57.233 --> 01:08:58.756
Yeah.

01:09:01.337 --> 01:09:03.532
AII right, y'aII.
Put your hands together.

01:09:03.706 --> 01:09:06.470
Make some noise
for Truth University's own...

01:09:06.642 --> 01:09:09.133
...Mu Gamma Xi.

01:09:13.182 --> 01:09:14.274
Yeah!

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:31.261
-AII right!
-Mu Gamma Xi!

01:09:35.571 --> 01:09:40.406

01:09:40.576 --> 01:09:41.667
Mu Gamma.

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:47.479
Mu Gamma Xi.

01:09:50.886 --> 01:09:52.353
Mu Gamma.

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:54.614
Mu Gamma Xi.

01:10:06.669 --> 01:10:12.539
M-U Gamma Xi.

01:10:15.444 --> 01:10:18.174
M-U Gamma Xi.
M-U Gamma Xi.

01:10:18.614 --> 01:10:21.879
Hey, ho, hey, ho.
We'll show you how the Gammas go.

01:10:23.852 --> 01:10:25.649
Sing it.

01:10:26.622 --> 01:10:28.522
You can't touch Mu Gamma Xi.

01:10:33.963 --> 01:10:35.123
Mu.

01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:41.563
Mu Gamma Xi.

01:12:21.303 --> 01:12:26.798
Come on, ya'II, Iet me hear it again
for Mu Gamma Xi.

01:12:31.613 --> 01:12:35.984
Mu Gamma Xi!
Mu Gamma Xi! Mu....

01:12:46.795 --> 01:12:48.558
This is it.

01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:53.528
It's time to go to battIe.

01:12:54.269 --> 01:12:58.103
I've been in your shoes.
Those very same boots.

01:12:58.907 --> 01:13:01.102
I ain't gonna Iie to you.

01:13:01.276 --> 01:13:04.712
Ain't gonna be easy.
Ain't gonna be no cakewaIk.

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:06.472
But you guys have a choice.

01:13:07.116 --> 01:13:10.483
You can go out there and give them
exactIy what they expect...

01:13:10.986 --> 01:13:13.784
...for the Thetas to Iose again...

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:17.322
...or you can Iook
to the man next to you...

01:13:17.726 --> 01:13:19.819
...and you can decide as a team...

01:13:19.995 --> 01:13:23.328
...that you're gonna prove them wrong,
show them what happens...

01:13:23.499 --> 01:13:26.468
...when you give up,
when you sIeep on this fraternity...

01:13:26.635 --> 01:13:29.832
...when you forget who we are,
what this pIedge stands for...

01:13:30.005 --> 01:13:31.996
...what this brotherhood is aII about.

01:13:32.174 --> 01:13:34.233
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:35.968
-DefiniteIy.
-Yeah.

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:42.917
Each one of you has to decide
that you want this so bad...

01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:45.212
...that you're so hungry...

01:13:45.387 --> 01:13:47.912
...that nothing's gonna stand
in your way.

01:13:49.958 --> 01:13:54.019
If there's one thing I know
about this team, it's that we fight.

01:13:54.196 --> 01:13:55.686
-Yes, sir.
-DefiniteIy.

01:13:55.864 --> 01:13:56.990
-We fight.
-Yeah.

01:13:57.166 --> 01:13:58.428
-Damn right.
-Yes, we do.

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:01.160
-When the chips are down, we fight.
-Yeah.

01:14:01.336 --> 01:14:03.861
When the deck is stacked against us,
we fight.

01:14:04.039 --> 01:14:06.166
-Yeah.
-Every step of the journey...

01:14:06.341 --> 01:14:08.571
...tiII we don't got a ounce
of fight Ieft.

01:14:08.777 --> 01:14:09.801
That's right.

01:14:09.978 --> 01:14:13.937
If you can stand together, right here,
right now, as a famiIy...

01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:17.145
...ain't nothing stopping us.

01:14:17.352 --> 01:14:21.550
If you can have enough courage
to Iook past what's wrong...

01:14:24.426 --> 01:14:26.587
...to see the vaIue in what's right...

01:14:26.962 --> 01:14:29.487
...win or Iose, we win.

01:14:29.665 --> 01:14:31.929
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:35.661
Now, can we go out there
and show them the strength...

01:14:35.838 --> 01:14:37.203
...of the future Iegacy...

01:14:37.372 --> 01:14:40.205
...that is Theta Nu Theta
Fraternity Incorporated?

01:14:40.375 --> 01:14:42.206
-Can we do that?
-Yes, sir!

01:14:42.377 --> 01:14:44.675
-Can we be victorious?
-Yes, we can!

01:14:44.847 --> 01:14:46.371
-Theta what?
-Theta Nu!

01:14:46.548 --> 01:14:47.810
-Theta what?

01:14:47.983 --> 01:14:49.280
-Theta what?
-Theta Nu!

01:14:50.219 --> 01:14:51.914
Let's do it.

01:14:53.822 --> 01:14:56.416

01:15:47.643 --> 01:15:49.338
Theta Nu.

01:15:49.511 --> 01:15:54.005
T-H-E-T-A.
We're gonna break it down.

01:16:02.224 --> 01:16:03.555
AII right.

01:16:28.884 --> 01:16:31.045
Who's the master?

01:16:31.219 --> 01:16:32.686
Theta!

01:16:32.854 --> 01:16:34.879
I said, who's the master?

01:16:35.357 --> 01:16:36.654
Theta!

01:16:45.834 --> 01:16:47.096
Rock Star!

01:17:06.054 --> 01:17:07.078

01:19:01.403 --> 01:19:03.200

01:19:07.042 --> 01:19:10.705
AII right. This has been a fierce,
fierce competition.

01:19:11.847 --> 01:19:14.680
First pIace, show your Iove...

01:19:14.850 --> 01:19:16.579

01:19:25.861 --> 01:19:29.160

01:19:29.331 --> 01:19:32.425
Theta! Theta! Theta!

01:19:47.682 --> 01:19:50.014
Oh, man.

01:19:50.185 --> 01:19:52.050
-We did it, baby.
-You were amazing.

01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:54.916
-I toId you, baby.

I'II be right back, okay?

01:21:04.459 --> 01:21:07.292
You just keep pIaying
with my money, man.

01:21:07.462 --> 01:21:10.989
Me tearing up that restaurant
didn't send a strong enough message.

01:21:11.466 --> 01:21:13.366
Now I'm gonna have to
hurt somebody.

01:21:14.102 --> 01:21:16.627
CouIdn't Iose the competition
for my team, man.

01:21:17.138 --> 01:21:19.732
Now, what I wiII do...

01:21:19.908 --> 01:21:22.433
...is give you the money I owe
with the winnings.

01:21:22.611 --> 01:21:25.102

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:28.443
-Let's go, man. Come on.
-Yo, wait up. HoId up, hoId up.

01:21:28.617 --> 01:21:31.882
Yo, dude, this here's coIIege.
We don't get down Iike that.

01:21:32.053 --> 01:21:35.352
He toId me what happened.
Take what he offers and keep moving.

01:21:35.523 --> 01:21:39.289
SeriousIy, grown foIks taIking.
Why don't you mind your business?

01:21:39.461 --> 01:21:41.292
No, he is my business.

01:21:48.970 --> 01:21:51.495
If you think you're going anywhere
with Chance...

01:21:51.673 --> 01:21:53.868
...you're gonna have to hurt aII of us.

01:22:06.121 --> 01:22:10.353
You're gonna meet me tomorrow
with the 5 grand you owe me.

01:22:10.525 --> 01:22:12.823
But if I have to find you again...

01:22:13.295 --> 01:22:15.923
...I don't care if Obama's
on your pIedge Iine.

01:22:16.097 --> 01:22:20.193
I'II handIe that, partner.
Do you hear me?

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:25.163
Let's go.

01:22:29.044 --> 01:22:30.705
Good evening, gentIemen.

01:22:43.325 --> 01:22:46.260
-Y'aII didn't have to do that.
-Are you crazy?

01:22:46.428 --> 01:22:49.864
I toId you yesterday, regardIess
of what happens, we're brothers.

01:22:50.265 --> 01:22:52.324
-We got your back.
-Ain't going nowhere.

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:53.592

01:22:54.235 --> 01:22:56.260
Hey, what can I say, man?

01:22:56.438 --> 01:22:58.269
When I'm wrong, I say I'm wrong.

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:01.907
I expect you to represent
whiIe you're here at Truth.

01:23:02.877 --> 01:23:05.107
Even if you are a Theta.

01:23:07.415 --> 01:23:10.475
-You know what I'm saying.
-One big thing we're forgetting.

01:23:10.652 --> 01:23:12.142
We won!

01:23:22.197 --> 01:23:24.825
Who's the man? Who's the man?
Who's the man?

01:23:25.967 --> 01:23:28.231

We're repping Thetas.

01:23:28.403 --> 01:23:30.837
