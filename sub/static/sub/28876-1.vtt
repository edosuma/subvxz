00:51.385 --> 00:55.473
FRIEND

03:05.500 --> 03:06.718
Blacksta.

03:08.086 --> 03:09.304
Blacksta.

03:14.868 --> 03:17.537
- What's up, Kena?
- I'm good

03:18.163 --> 03:19.873
We good?

03:20.790 --> 03:22.650
So, I'll see you later, beautiful?

03:22.750 --> 03:25.545
- But we're not done yet.
- Don't worry. Later.

03:44.439 --> 03:46.925
At least buy her dinner.

03:47.025 --> 03:49.219
No way. Her mother runs a kiosk.

03:49.319 --> 03:52.155
It would be an insult
to take her out elsewhere.

03:55.408 --> 03:57.060
Take this.

03:57.160 --> 03:58.870
At least buy her some chips.

04:01.414 --> 04:03.791
Cool. Whatever.

04:11.049 --> 04:14.035
- How many cards?
- Four each.

04:14.135 --> 04:15.845
Don't bet all your money.

04:19.599 --> 04:21.851
Let's start.

04:29.859 --> 04:33.112
Blacky, I can see you are coming!

04:41.496 --> 04:44.190
- Are you going to Stevo's tomorrow?
- I don't think so.

04:44.290 --> 04:45.483
I win.

04:45.583 --> 04:48.903
Forget Stevo.
There's a new barber called Maina.

04:49.003 --> 04:52.006
Look how he hooked me up.

04:57.053 --> 04:58.329
What's wrong?

04:58.429 --> 05:00.373
The cut starts here.

05:00.473 --> 05:02.850
You look like Uncle Njugush.

05:07.855 --> 05:11.509
I thought you said
your girlfriend was at home.

05:11.609 --> 05:13.595
Yeah.
She's with your sister, cooking for me.

05:13.695 --> 05:15.363
Stop being stupid.

05:16.155 --> 05:18.349
What are you looking at, faggot?

05:18.449 --> 05:19.726
How is he hurting you?

05:19.826 --> 05:26.191
Do you think God is just
watching men fuck each other?

05:26.291 --> 05:27.901
I don't want to play anymore.

05:28.001 --> 05:29.836
Do you want a real drink?

05:35.591 --> 05:38.036
I have to go. I'm working tomorrow.

05:38.136 --> 05:40.038
No worries.

05:40.138 --> 05:41.664
You'll make a good wife.

05:41.764 --> 05:44.309
That's why I like you.

05:44.976 --> 05:46.602
Later.

06:14.756 --> 06:17.158
It's fine, Mrs. Machoko. Pay me next time.

06:17.258 --> 06:19.702
John, you have my vote.

06:19.802 --> 06:21.079
I know.

06:21.179 --> 06:25.141
Your vote is more important
than two bags of flour and soap.

06:26.934 --> 06:28.728
You are welcome.

06:29.645 --> 06:31.189
Kena.

06:32.357 --> 06:34.108
Can I talk to you?

06:34.734 --> 06:36.277
Can we talk later?

06:37.070 --> 06:38.279
Okay.

06:43.117 --> 06:44.494
How's Mum doing?

06:45.870 --> 06:47.038
The same.

06:48.581 --> 06:50.149
Dad, I need to go.

06:50.249 --> 06:51.751
- I'll be back later.
- Okay.

07:05.098 --> 07:08.251
I saw Mr. Otieno coming out of block C-E

07:08.351 --> 07:09.836
at twelve o'clock in the afternoon.

07:09.936 --> 07:11.354
From Mrs. Kamau's?

07:12.230 --> 07:14.023
At twelve o'clock in the afternoon?

07:15.608 --> 07:22.573
That woman is strong,
handling two men at the same time.

07:25.451 --> 07:28.329
I forgot to tell you. Congratulations.

07:29.997 --> 07:31.416
For what?

07:32.750 --> 07:33.735
You don't know?

07:33.835 --> 07:38.448
The woman your father just married
is pregnant.

07:38.548 --> 07:41.159
Don't you know? He didn't tell you?

07:41.259 --> 07:44.011
Don't you speak to each other?

07:46.097 --> 07:52.270
Go tell your mum that her ex-husband
is expecting a baby boy!

07:53.688 --> 07:55.314
Bring the food.

08:06.242 --> 08:07.452
Kena.

08:08.369 --> 08:09.996
Don't forget to tell her.

08:28.473 --> 08:32.626
And we shall not bring upon
the afflictions of Egypt.

08:32.727 --> 08:36.230
We ask for your restoration.
We ask for your healing today, Sheila.

08:37.690 --> 08:40.610
Yeah, I know this is difficult.
I know it is.

08:41.861 --> 08:43.696
Pray to Jehovah-Rapha.

08:44.238 --> 08:47.200
Jehovah-Rapha is our healer.
Pray to Jehovah-Rapha.

08:49.785 --> 08:51.145
Hey, Kena

08:51.245 --> 08:54.190
I was waiting and waiting.

08:54.290 --> 08:55.500
So hungry.

09:09.680 --> 09:11.098
What's wrong?

09:15.853 --> 09:17.188
Nothing.

09:20.358 --> 09:21.509
How was your day?

09:21.609 --> 09:23.594
The usual.

09:23.694 --> 09:27.265
I go there, I work, I teach.
No one listens.

09:27.365 --> 09:29.784
Those classes are getting so crowded now.

09:31.452 --> 09:33.204
What's wrong, Kena?

09:38.793 --> 09:40.419
Mama Atim.

09:42.129 --> 09:47.785
She seems to have something to say
about everyone and everything.

09:47.885 --> 09:50.346
Yeah, she's a gossip, but she doesn't lie.

09:55.726 --> 09:57.937
Did your father ask about me today?

10:01.983 --> 10:03.901
No, he didn't.

10:10.491 --> 10:12.743
He must be busy with the campaign.

10:33.264 --> 10:34.266
Dad.

10:38.769 --> 10:40.771
Why didn't you tell me?

10:51.073 --> 10:52.491
I tried.

10:53.117 --> 10:56.078
I wanted to tell you. I tried to tell you.

10:58.789 --> 11:01.917
I was worried about your mum and you.

11:08.966 --> 11:12.720
Kena, this will be your baby brother.

11:14.180 --> 11:18.976
I want him to know his big sister.

11:23.981 --> 11:27.468
Why don't you take the day off?
We can talk about it tomorrow together.

11:27.568 --> 11:30.096
Think about it.
Maybe go hang out with your friends.

11:30.196 --> 11:32.865
But think about it.
Maybe you can share it with your mum.

11:41.832 --> 11:43.167
Kena.

12:04.980 --> 12:06.857
- Hey, Kena.
- What's up, Blacksta?

12:08.609 --> 12:10.928
It's over there. Get off and walk.

12:11.028 --> 12:12.888
You said it's door-to-door service.

12:12.988 --> 12:17.076
How many doors have we passed to get here?

12:22.039 --> 12:24.667
Door-to-door? What's up?

12:30.047 --> 12:31.173
Blacksta.

12:32.842 --> 12:33.993
Okemi's daughter?

12:34.093 --> 12:37.204
You know
her father's running against mine?

12:37.304 --> 12:38.931
Stop that.

12:39.557 --> 12:40.750
Where are you going?

12:40.850 --> 12:43.753
I'm going home.

12:43.853 --> 12:46.172
I'll give you a ride.

12:46.272 --> 12:49.734
- Then hurry.
- I'll drive fast.

13:12.882 --> 13:14.091
Ziki.

13:16.677 --> 13:18.371
Hey! Hey!

13:18.471 --> 13:20.181
Oh, my God!

13:25.561 --> 13:27.062
She's coming!

13:28.773 --> 13:30.941
Ziki, she's going to kill you!

13:36.739 --> 13:38.199
Ziki!

13:39.784 --> 13:41.035
Guys.

13:42.286 --> 13:43.871
Ziki, run!

13:45.289 --> 13:51.445
Before we start our sermon,
I would like to welcome our guests.

13:51.545 --> 13:55.758
Our special guests, Assemblyman Okemi--

13:58.219 --> 14:03.766
...his wife, and his daughter.

14:05.768 --> 14:12.650
I would like to start the service
by talking about generosity of heart.

14:15.110 --> 14:18.973
We don't have a shortage
of generous people.

14:19.073 --> 14:22.034
We have a businessman here,
Mr. John Mwaura.

14:27.790 --> 14:32.194
A person who shares his wealth
with people that don't have enough,

14:32.294 --> 14:34.739
and he gives with a generous heart.

14:34.839 --> 14:37.408
Mr. Okemi, you'll agree with me.

14:37.508 --> 14:39.885
If you help others find relief...

14:42.888 --> 14:46.225
Mum, we should go.

14:48.769 --> 14:51.313
What's going on there?
It might be a new baby.

14:51.647 --> 14:54.066
Mum, it's so hot.

14:54.233 --> 14:55.651
Mercy.

14:59.822 --> 15:01.448
When is it due?

15:03.868 --> 15:06.453
When is it due?

15:08.998 --> 15:11.625
He's due in February.

15:15.880 --> 15:18.073
Can't you even answer me?

15:18.173 --> 15:22.094
You're man enough to have a son
and you can't even answer me.

15:24.430 --> 15:26.056
Come on, let's go.

15:33.856 --> 15:35.966
- Congratulations, John.
- Congratulations.

15:36.066 --> 15:37.693
You're sweet.

16:32.206 --> 16:34.900
So, I have to go and apologize.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.235
To who?

16:36.335 --> 16:38.988
You guys pulled down her dad's posters.

16:39.088 --> 16:41.340
- Really? That's where you're going?
- Ziki!

16:46.470 --> 16:47.955
Hi.

16:48.055 --> 16:49.456
Hi.

16:49.556 --> 16:51.225
So...

16:52.017 --> 16:53.627
Do you want to do something?

16:55.562 --> 16:57.631
We could go get a soda?

16:57.731 --> 16:59.274
A soda?

17:00.567 --> 17:02.069
Cool.

17:14.455 --> 17:16.290
Mama Atim's, eh?

17:19.837 --> 17:20.921
So?

17:21.922 --> 17:23.339
Want some food?

17:24.508 --> 17:26.117
Do you want something to eat?

17:26.218 --> 17:27.845
I don't think so.

17:29.138 --> 17:32.391
We're okay, thanks.

17:39.023 --> 17:40.674
This is where you hang out?

17:40.774 --> 17:44.553
Yeah. I usually hang out here
with Blacksta and the other guys.

17:44.653 --> 17:48.182
So like, usually right in here and...

17:48.282 --> 17:51.618
Both politicians' daughters?
Here at Mama Atim's?

17:53.078 --> 17:55.481
Today, the sun will rain!

17:55.581 --> 17:57.666
Wonders of the world.

18:00.711 --> 18:03.072
Do you think their fathers know?

18:03.172 --> 18:05.199
It's not my job to tell them.

18:05.299 --> 18:07.551
Would you like to get out of here?

18:11.847 --> 18:13.432
Look! They're leaving.

18:14.475 --> 18:16.268
They haven't finished their sodas.

18:40.250 --> 18:41.860
It's cool, yeah?

18:41.960 --> 18:44.546
Yeah, it's nice.

19:12.199 --> 19:13.617
Kena.

19:26.839 --> 19:28.841
- You good?
- Yeah.

19:37.975 --> 19:40.102
Tell me something about you.

19:43.230 --> 19:45.090
I'm waiting for my marks.

19:45.190 --> 19:49.470
Then after that,
there's a nursing school I'm hoping for.

19:49.570 --> 19:51.388
You want to be a nurse?

19:51.488 --> 19:52.698
Yes.

19:53.657 --> 19:56.935
Like, why a nurse?
You can be anything else.

19:57.035 --> 20:00.289
Like a doctor. You can be a surgeon.

20:04.543 --> 20:06.445
People need nurses.

20:06.545 --> 20:09.006
People need a lot of things.

20:11.008 --> 20:13.343
So, university?

20:14.094 --> 20:16.805
I don't know. I want to travel first.

20:18.765 --> 20:20.876
I want to see the world

20:20.976 --> 20:25.297
and to go to all those places where
they've probably never seen an African

20:25.397 --> 20:31.278
and just show up there and be like, "Yo,
I'm here and I'm a Kenyan from Africa."

20:34.364 --> 20:37.684
But you're not the typical Kenyan girl--

20:37.784 --> 20:39.953
- I know.
- ...that they'd be looking for.

20:42.039 --> 20:45.667
Well, I don't know.
My parents don't think the same way.

20:46.501 --> 20:48.503
I don't want to be like them.

20:51.256 --> 20:55.427
Just staying at home
and doing typical Kenyan stuff--

20:56.595 --> 20:59.748
doing the laundry, having babies.

20:59.848 --> 21:01.333
Making chapati.

21:01.433 --> 21:03.435
No one likes making chapati.

21:05.395 --> 21:07.397
Let's make a pact...

21:08.523 --> 21:11.985
that we will never be
like any of them down there.

21:12.861 --> 21:14.571
Instead...

21:16.531 --> 21:18.158
we're gonna be...

21:19.201 --> 21:20.477
Something.

21:20.577 --> 21:22.204
We're gonna be something.

21:28.210 --> 21:30.420
Something real?

21:31.046 --> 21:33.674
Yes. Something real.

21:41.974 --> 21:45.269
So I hear you've been spending time
with Okemi's daughter.

21:47.437 --> 21:49.648
Yes, I have.

21:50.732 --> 21:52.567
Does your father know?

21:54.444 --> 21:58.323
I'm sure Mama Atim
is just dying to tell him.

22:00.784 --> 22:03.228
You should bring her over.
I'd like to meet her.

22:03.328 --> 22:05.497
Okay. I will.

22:09.793 --> 22:12.587
Something's different about you, Kena.

22:14.589 --> 22:17.134
Nothing's different.

22:20.637 --> 22:23.332
- Is it a boy?
- Mum! No.

22:23.432 --> 22:25.000
Is it that Blacksta?

22:25.100 --> 22:26.710
No.

22:26.810 --> 22:29.755
People like the Okemis will lift you up.

22:29.855 --> 22:32.049
Everyone else, including that Blacksta,

22:32.149 --> 22:36.069
will just be a weight
that keeps you stuck right here.

22:39.823 --> 22:41.658
Choose wisely, Kena.

23:16.276 --> 23:18.070
Let's go!

23:21.740 --> 23:23.116
Can we play?

23:24.034 --> 23:26.311
Can we play?

23:26.411 --> 23:27.454
No.

23:28.872 --> 23:30.065
But you let her.

23:30.165 --> 23:33.318
Who, Kena? She plays like a guy!
Right, Kena?

23:33.418 --> 23:36.947
And you girls will distract us.

23:37.047 --> 23:39.966
So you guys are afraid we'll beat you.

23:42.511 --> 23:44.137
It's okay. Let them play.

23:45.889 --> 23:47.833
I'm not about to get sweaty.

23:47.933 --> 23:51.561
Don't worry. I'll get you sweaty later.

23:53.230 --> 23:54.815
Let's play!

24:07.327 --> 24:08.995
Kena! Kena, open!

24:50.412 --> 24:52.038
This is nice.

25:28.366 --> 25:29.868
I have to go.

25:32.037 --> 25:33.371
Stay.

25:44.132 --> 25:45.342
Hey.

25:46.927 --> 25:48.345
I'll see you later?

27:37.662 --> 27:41.291
My name is Makena, a friend of Ziki's.

27:42.083 --> 27:42.901
Okay.

27:43.001 --> 27:44.419
Is she home?

27:45.462 --> 27:47.464
Yes, she's home.

29:09.212 --> 29:11.715
I want us to go on a real date.

29:13.299 --> 29:14.759
Like real.

29:21.307 --> 29:23.518
I've seen how you look at me.

30:02.015 --> 30:04.225
You have to try this on.

30:05.393 --> 30:07.228
It's perfect.

30:30.710 --> 30:32.295
Do you think about me?

30:34.756 --> 30:36.090
Sometimes.

30:37.258 --> 30:41.095
And what do you think about... me?

30:43.431 --> 30:45.141
Your eyes.

30:49.354 --> 30:53.399
If we were to do something--
just me and you-- what would we do?

30:55.318 --> 30:57.779
We'd go on night drives.

30:59.739 --> 31:02.408
We'd definitely stare at the sky.

31:04.953 --> 31:06.955
And then what?

31:13.920 --> 31:15.547
Come.

31:49.747 --> 31:52.942
I had so much fun.
We still have paint on our faces.

31:53.042 --> 31:55.795
You have to get rid of this
when you get home.

32:16.274 --> 32:18.468
I'll make some more
for your beautiful wife.

32:18.568 --> 32:19.886
Oh, thank you.

32:19.986 --> 32:21.988
I'm sure she'll be grateful.

32:26.034 --> 32:28.202
I'm sorry. I overslept.

32:31.080 --> 32:33.082
Kena, you never oversleep.

32:34.250 --> 32:36.085
Were you out last night?

32:38.338 --> 32:41.799
I was. I was out with some friend.

32:43.301 --> 32:44.928
Which friend?

32:48.556 --> 32:50.250
Okemi's daughter.

32:50.350 --> 32:52.919
- She's nice.
- That's not the point.

32:53.019 --> 32:54.646
Okemi's daughter.

33:01.027 --> 33:02.445
You know...

33:04.948 --> 33:08.284
people have spent money in this campaign.

33:09.285 --> 33:11.729
I'm spending money in this campaign.

33:11.829 --> 33:14.899
But you know what they're gonna tell me,
what they're gonna say?

33:14.999 --> 33:18.461
Why are we supporting this guy?
Yet his own daughter doesn't.

33:19.587 --> 33:21.865
You didn't even want this job
in the first place.

33:21.965 --> 33:25.451
Well, I took it.
And now the people are depending on me,

33:25.551 --> 33:28.371
and letting them down is not an option,
Kena.

33:28.471 --> 33:31.499
You're a clever girl. Use your brain!

33:31.599 --> 33:33.017
You're a smart one.

34:00.545 --> 34:03.089
Peter Okemi! Man of action!

34:04.882 --> 34:07.385
Peter Okemi! Man of action!

34:33.161 --> 34:35.038
- Dad.
- I'm okay.

34:36.330 --> 34:37.748
I'm okay.

34:39.876 --> 34:42.295
Minor setback, but I'm okay.

34:43.629 --> 34:45.630
I'd still vote for you.

35:15.870 --> 35:18.331
- Hi.
- Hey, love.

35:21.250 --> 35:22.235
Good morning.

35:22.335 --> 35:24.545
- You know exam results are out?
- Yeah.

35:26.130 --> 35:27.590
Ziki?

35:28.466 --> 35:31.619
Okay, fine. Have you checked?

35:31.719 --> 35:33.997
- No. I've been waiting for you.
- Okay.

35:34.097 --> 35:36.140
Have you-- Have you checked?

35:36.808 --> 35:38.976
- Yeah.
- Okay.

35:40.103 --> 35:42.088
- Do you want to guess what you got?
- No, no. Don't--

35:42.188 --> 35:44.048
Okay, tell me. No, don't tell me.

35:44.148 --> 35:46.692
Just, like, guess. Guess what you have.

35:47.902 --> 35:49.178
A "C." Yeah.

35:49.278 --> 35:51.681
- You think you got a "C"?
- Yes.

35:51.781 --> 35:53.407
Definitely.

35:54.283 --> 35:56.035
Okay, like, aim higher.

35:56.619 --> 35:57.995
C-plus?

36:00.790 --> 36:02.442
You think you got a C-plus?

36:02.542 --> 36:04.710
Okay. That's what you got.

36:07.171 --> 36:09.590
- That's what you got!
- Oh, my gosh.

36:13.594 --> 36:15.121
- I get to be a doctor!
- Yes.

36:15.221 --> 36:17.123
- That's what this means.
- That's what that means.

36:17.223 --> 36:19.208
- I can get a scholarship.
- Yes.

36:19.308 --> 36:22.003
And you're the one
who wanted to be a nurse.

36:22.103 --> 36:24.130
You wanted to be a nurse,
like, with these grades.

36:24.230 --> 36:25.548
- You think a nurse--
- I can be a doctor.

36:25.648 --> 36:27.175
You can be a doctor.

36:27.275 --> 36:28.985
Doctor Kena.

36:30.695 --> 36:32.321
Ziki!

36:32.613 --> 36:34.807
And you? What did you get?

36:34.907 --> 36:36.117
Ziki!

36:37.201 --> 36:39.312
- Can we talk about it later?
- Yeah.

36:39.412 --> 36:41.731
- Yeah?
- Ziki, come here right now!

36:41.831 --> 36:43.316
Is everything okay?

36:43.416 --> 36:45.084
- Yes.

36:45.668 --> 36:47.086
- Yes.

36:47.670 --> 36:48.946
Dad, it doesn't matter.

36:49.046 --> 36:51.215
What do you mean it doesn't matter?
What doesn't matter?

37:27.001 --> 37:29.003
- Hey!
- Hi.

37:31.297 --> 37:33.466
Dance with me.

37:35.968 --> 37:37.178
Kena.

37:55.112 --> 37:56.489
Shots!

37:57.365 --> 37:59.183
I have a toast!

37:59.283 --> 38:05.915
Cheers to Kena
for bringing me my future ex-wife.

38:09.293 --> 38:12.989
Another toast.
To Kena, my number one girl.

38:13.089 --> 38:15.908
The smartest nurse in Slopes!

38:16.008 --> 38:19.262
Today we drink!

38:25.017 --> 38:26.210
Blacky, Blacky.

38:26.310 --> 38:30.690
Now he walks even more like a fag.

38:32.483 --> 38:34.318
Homo!

38:48.791 --> 38:52.295
Your hair looks amazing. What's it called?

39:01.804 --> 39:03.514
Why did you leave?

39:24.994 --> 39:26.203
Kena.

39:28.497 --> 39:31.500
- Is that for me?
- Yeah.

39:33.419 --> 39:34.503
Wow.

39:50.102 --> 39:52.521
- Is that my cupcake?
- Yeah.

40:07.328 --> 40:09.080
Just try it out.

40:24.845 --> 40:26.931
I'm sorry that I came yelling.

40:30.559 --> 40:32.561
This is really nice.

40:34.688 --> 40:36.148
You're welcome.

42:32.723 --> 42:35.100
No. Stay.

42:39.563 --> 42:41.065
Stay.

42:56.080 --> 42:58.082
I wish this was real.

42:59.667 --> 43:01.085
It is.

43:03.963 --> 43:06.006
When we go out there...

43:07.758 --> 43:09.260
Don't worry.

43:10.427 --> 43:12.429
We'll do this again.

43:13.556 --> 43:16.125
Come. Let me walk you home.

43:16.225 --> 43:17.434
No.

43:18.394 --> 43:20.838
I don't want to go home.

43:20.938 --> 43:23.841
Would you want to go and fetch water,

43:23.941 --> 43:25.734
or would you rather stay here?

44:01.228 --> 44:02.646
Hey, Kena.

44:03.606 --> 44:05.608
What's up, Blacksta?

44:07.860 --> 44:09.361
You've been out all night?

44:10.821 --> 44:12.448
Something like that.

44:13.365 --> 44:15.059
Who is the guy?

44:15.159 --> 44:17.911
Guy?

44:19.121 --> 44:20.147
Fine then.

44:20.247 --> 44:22.249
One day you will see for yourself.

44:24.251 --> 44:27.196
- See what?
- The kind of guy I am.

44:27.296 --> 44:29.198
I'll give you everything
you've ever wanted--

44:29.298 --> 44:33.594
money in your account,
a mortgage, title deed.

44:35.054 --> 44:37.248
You think that's all I want in life?

44:37.348 --> 44:39.558
That's what everybody wants.

44:40.059 --> 44:41.585
Let's do this.

44:41.685 --> 44:44.229
Let me finish my workout,
and I'll come get you.

44:45.939 --> 44:47.424
Later.

44:47.524 --> 44:49.902
Just a bike ride. It's not a big deal.

44:50.486 --> 44:52.012
I'll get my bike and come.

44:52.112 --> 44:54.056
- Blacksta.
- Nduta, I'm busy.

44:54.156 --> 44:56.700
- Why won't you answer me?
- What do you say, Kena?

44:58.952 --> 45:01.747
Nduta, I am busy. What's the problem?

45:03.874 --> 45:05.834
I have to go.

45:08.754 --> 45:12.216
You don't have to be mean to me.

45:36.115 --> 45:37.516
She's gonna come back.

45:37.616 --> 45:40.577
I told you my body's allergic to dresses.

45:44.998 --> 45:47.000
Come on, Kena, let's go.

46:07.146 --> 46:10.315
Ziki, doesn't she just look
like a proper woman?

46:10.899 --> 46:12.109
Very sexy.

46:14.361 --> 46:17.598
All we need is a nice, rich doctor,

46:17.698 --> 46:20.909
and all my prayers
will have been answered today.

46:24.621 --> 46:26.857
I would like to start the service.

46:26.957 --> 46:32.963
Before I start, I would like to thank God
for giving me a wife.

46:34.256 --> 46:37.176
My wife is beautiful, clever...

46:38.177 --> 46:41.638
courageous, and wise.

46:43.307 --> 46:45.459
What surprises me

46:45.559 --> 46:51.090
is that there are Kenyans
who are challenging the government

46:51.190 --> 46:56.904
because of their stand...
on same-sex marriage.

46:57.362 --> 47:02.434
They say it's a human right.

47:02.534 --> 47:05.771
What is a human right?

47:05.871 --> 47:10.125
Isn't it God who decides
what is right and what isn't?

47:10.918 --> 47:15.672
Are we going to ignore God?
Don't choose to be lost!

47:16.590 --> 47:22.346
Because God's laws don't change
like human laws or your country's.

47:23.347 --> 47:28.377
Let's go to the Word of God
and see what it says.

47:28.477 --> 47:32.172
"God left them to follow
their shameful desires.

47:32.272 --> 47:35.818
Even women changed their natural ways...

47:36.819 --> 47:40.155
to unnatural ways."

47:40.656 --> 47:41.932
Understand?

47:42.032 --> 47:43.851
"And men did the same thing.

47:43.951 --> 47:47.162
They left women for unnatural ways...

47:48.580 --> 47:50.733
and desired other men.

47:50.833 --> 47:54.111
They did shameful things with other men.

47:54.211 --> 47:59.508
And as a result of their sin,
they suffered."

48:02.719 --> 48:05.247
I was just having fun.

48:05.347 --> 48:07.541
Fun? Is that all you think about?

48:07.641 --> 48:10.127
- Kena, what's the problem?
- My family's in there.

48:10.227 --> 48:11.754
My family's in there also.

48:11.854 --> 48:14.173
Everyone was listening to the sermon.
Who was watching?

48:14.273 --> 48:15.257
No one.

48:15.357 --> 48:17.009
No one was paying attention.

48:17.109 --> 48:19.762
Is it wrong for me to show you
how I feel when I feel?

48:19.862 --> 48:21.864
No, it's not.

48:22.406 --> 48:24.975
It's not, but you can't do it here.

48:25.075 --> 48:28.103
You want to tell me that whole church
was watching me and what I was doing?

48:28.203 --> 48:28.854
Exactly.

48:28.954 --> 48:30.522
- Are you serious right now?
- Yes.

48:30.622 --> 48:32.357
No one gives a shit!

48:32.457 --> 48:33.817
Like, they don't care!

48:33.917 --> 48:37.613
When are you ever going to do stuff
without thinking of who will see

48:37.713 --> 48:39.865
or what they'll say
or what's going to happen after?

48:39.965 --> 48:41.658
Just be you.

48:41.758 --> 48:44.887
This is irresponsible, Ziki.
We can do this somewhere else.

48:54.855 --> 48:56.064
Kena.

48:59.568 --> 49:01.194
Are you okay?

49:10.537 --> 49:12.164
Let's go for a ride.

49:14.791 --> 49:17.377
Fresh air gets rid of stress.

50:49.094 --> 50:52.514
I wish we could go somewhere
where we could be real.

50:53.724 --> 50:55.475
What do you mean "real"?

50:58.645 --> 51:00.772
Don't worry. It's okay.

51:31.845 --> 51:34.957
Kena, do me a favor.
Can you hold the shop while I'm away?

51:35.057 --> 51:39.895
Mama Kamau's child is unwell.
I'm taking them to the hospital.

51:41.313 --> 51:43.732
Sure. Every vote counts.

52:27.692 --> 52:28.819
Hey!

52:29.319 --> 52:31.304
Stay away from Ziki!

52:31.404 --> 52:33.598
Are you a fucking lesbian or something?

52:33.698 --> 52:36.768
I see the way you look at her,
and it's sick.

52:36.868 --> 52:40.205
Whatever it is that you're trying,
you'll not get away with it.

52:42.624 --> 52:45.085
Look at you. You're nothing.

52:47.587 --> 52:49.005
Stay away from me!

52:49.548 --> 52:50.532
Kena!

52:50.632 --> 52:52.968
Leave me alone! Bitch! Get away from me!

52:56.138 --> 52:57.639
Kena, get off of her!

52:58.640 --> 53:00.433
Yeah, I told you she's crazy.

53:01.017 --> 53:02.794
What's your problem!

53:02.894 --> 53:06.631
How can you choose her over me? Let me go!

53:06.731 --> 53:08.008
Just let them go!

53:08.108 --> 53:10.861
- How can you do this to me?
- Elizabeth, just stop it!

53:15.198 --> 53:16.198
Careful.

53:23.165 --> 53:24.749
What?

53:26.459 --> 53:28.153
I love you.

53:28.253 --> 53:30.463
So then how come you don't tell me?

53:37.554 --> 53:38.789
Careful, Ziki.

53:38.889 --> 53:40.640
I've not even touched you.

53:51.610 --> 53:53.820
Does that make it any better?

54:09.419 --> 54:11.488
Kena, get out.

54:11.588 --> 54:13.048
Mum.

54:13.548 --> 54:14.366
She was just--

54:14.466 --> 54:16.968
This is the reason
why you and Elizabeth fought.

54:17.636 --> 54:19.746
I was-- She was bleeding.

54:19.846 --> 54:21.581
I've just been on the phone to her mother.

54:21.681 --> 54:24.126
Mum, Elizabeth was calling her names.

54:24.226 --> 54:25.335
Names?

54:25.435 --> 54:29.005
What do you think I am?
What do you take me for-- stupid?

54:29.105 --> 54:31.216
Naive? Blind?

54:31.316 --> 54:33.443
I have seen it all, Ziki.

54:35.195 --> 54:36.221
Mum...

54:36.321 --> 54:38.306
You know, I've had enough.
I'm calling her mother now.

54:38.406 --> 54:40.100
Mum, please don't.

54:40.200 --> 54:41.184
- Please.
- Mum, don't.

54:41.284 --> 54:43.436
I've had enough. It's finished.

54:43.536 --> 54:45.856
- Please, Mrs. Okemi.
- Kena, no, I've had enough!

54:45.956 --> 54:48.541
Mum, please don't. Mum, please don't!

54:49.417 --> 54:50.669
Ziki!

54:51.336 --> 54:52.571
Ziki!

54:52.671 --> 54:54.030
Come, come, come.

54:54.130 --> 54:55.340
Ziki!

55:14.025 --> 55:16.027
Kena, let's go.

55:32.210 --> 55:34.004
- Get in.
- Thanks.

55:41.720 --> 55:43.722
- We locked her in.
- I know.

55:45.265 --> 55:47.267
What are you going to do?

56:01.239 --> 56:05.118
We could have our own place,
just me and you.

56:07.871 --> 56:11.666
You got really good grades in your exams,
so you're going to be a doctor.

56:12.459 --> 56:14.252
And I can get a job.

56:17.881 --> 56:20.800
Plus, like, I'll cook for you chapati.
Every time.

56:23.887 --> 56:24.971
Yes?

56:40.820 --> 56:42.364
What are you doing?

56:43.156 --> 56:45.642
- What do you want?
- Do your parents know?

56:45.742 --> 56:47.686
Like you can't mind your own business?

56:47.786 --> 56:49.354
I told you, Mum.

56:49.454 --> 56:51.022
What the fuck does she want?

56:51.122 --> 56:54.693
Come! They're here! I found them!

56:54.793 --> 56:59.631
The politicians' daughters
stuck together like dogs!

57:00.465 --> 57:02.075
Come! Come!

57:02.175 --> 57:03.968
Get them out.

58:03.695 --> 58:05.029
Ziki!

58:10.326 --> 58:12.078
Ziki!

58:18.668 --> 58:20.211
Ziki!

58:33.850 --> 58:34.893
Waireri!

58:59.334 --> 59:00.376
Hey!

59:03.588 --> 59:05.882
Between the two of you...

59:07.509 --> 59:09.135
which one of you is the man?

59:10.094 --> 59:12.096
We want it for our records, eh?

59:15.141 --> 59:16.434
Ziki.

59:26.069 --> 59:28.655
- Where is the police chief's office?
- This way.

59:45.505 --> 59:48.283
And you! Stay away from my family!

59:48.383 --> 59:49.384
Get in the car!

01:00:08.695 --> 01:00:09.695
Ziki.

01:00:12.907 --> 01:00:15.785
- Haven't you hurt her enough already?
- Get in the car!

01:00:58.161 --> 01:01:00.163
Your mother already knows.

01:01:02.582 --> 01:01:04.208
Will you come in?

01:01:12.592 --> 01:01:13.593
Okay.

01:01:29.317 --> 01:01:31.361
Go. Clean up.

01:01:32.362 --> 01:01:33.263
How will it help?

01:01:33.363 --> 01:01:36.032
Let her clean up.
We can talk after that.

01:01:36.866 --> 01:01:38.951
She will never be clean.

01:01:40.119 --> 01:01:43.481
Why don't you save that anger for
those guys who almost beat her to death?

01:01:43.581 --> 01:01:46.401
They should be at the police station,
not our daughter.

01:01:46.501 --> 01:01:48.945
- So you're fine with this?
- It's not that easy.

01:01:49.045 --> 01:01:52.782
You know everything about easy. Don't you?

01:01:52.882 --> 01:01:54.200
Don't make this about me, Mercy.

01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:56.077
It is always about you.

01:01:56.177 --> 01:01:59.581
You are the shopkeeper! You are the MCA!

01:01:59.681 --> 01:02:00.873
What am I?

01:02:00.973 --> 01:02:05.169
A single mother alone who always
gets blamed for everything.

01:02:05.269 --> 01:02:08.590
They will probably blame me for this
just like they blamed me when you left me!

01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:10.883
Mercy, I don't think it was anyone's fault
that this happened.

01:02:10.983 --> 01:02:12.927
It is her fault! It is your fault!

01:02:13.027 --> 01:02:14.512
- Mum.
- Don't you dare!

01:02:14.612 --> 01:02:17.782
- I'm sorry.
- Don't you dare speak to me!

01:02:20.159 --> 01:02:22.161
It is your fault, John.

01:02:25.873 --> 01:02:26.999
Kena.

01:02:27.625 --> 01:02:30.862
Are you forgetting that demons
have possessed this child?

01:02:30.962 --> 01:02:33.156
You want me to accept these demons
in this house?

01:02:33.256 --> 01:02:37.760
- Are you suggesting--
- I am concentrating on cleansing her.

01:02:38.678 --> 01:02:41.664
She is full of demons,
and it is because of you--

01:02:41.764 --> 01:02:45.143
you and those women out there.

01:02:52.984 --> 01:02:55.111
It is all your fault!

01:03:03.035 --> 01:03:04.454
Blacksta.

01:03:10.293 --> 01:03:11.293
Kena?

01:03:49.457 --> 01:03:54.462
We're humbled, and our hearts are broken.

01:03:55.797 --> 01:03:58.674
We pray to you, merciful God...

01:03:59.759 --> 01:04:03.805
to save this soul.

01:04:05.223 --> 01:04:07.166
We praise your name.

01:04:07.266 --> 01:04:09.268
You are all-powerful.

01:04:09.936 --> 01:04:11.813
Show mercy on Kena.

01:04:12.897 --> 01:04:17.051
Let your blessing descend upon her.

01:04:17.151 --> 01:04:19.862
Let your grace be manifested.

01:04:22.782 --> 01:04:26.327
Show us your power.

01:04:26.744 --> 01:04:30.498
Oh, God, be God.

01:04:31.207 --> 01:04:32.917
Thank you, Lord.

01:04:34.377 --> 01:04:36.587
Thank you, gracious God.

01:04:37.588 --> 01:04:41.008
Thank you, gracious God!

01:04:42.218 --> 01:04:44.303
We take action in your name.

01:04:45.012 --> 01:04:51.102
We say every strong hold is broken.

01:06:04.634 --> 01:06:05.885
Mum?

01:07:23.629 --> 01:07:24.839
Dad.

01:07:34.682 --> 01:07:36.684
I think we should close early today.

01:07:38.853 --> 01:07:42.815
I'm not seeing any customers
coming our way.

01:07:43.566 --> 01:07:46.344
You're losing because of me.

01:07:46.444 --> 01:07:48.070
It could have been worse.

01:07:49.488 --> 01:07:51.115
You could have gone to jail.

01:07:51.657 --> 01:07:53.159
I'll tell them it's my fault.

01:07:53.743 --> 01:07:55.703
You had nothing to do with it.

01:07:56.495 --> 01:07:58.356
I want to be an MCA,

01:07:58.456 --> 01:08:03.377
but, Kena,
there are some things I can never do.

01:08:32.363 --> 01:08:34.492
Hi, Kena. Let's go for a ride.

01:08:36.368 --> 01:08:38.370
Just a short ride.

01:08:39.705 --> 01:08:40.706
Maybe later.

01:08:41.582 --> 01:08:42.582
Why?

01:08:44.167 --> 01:08:45.961
I love that girl.

01:08:47.212 --> 01:08:49.698
Why do you like hurting the people
that care about you?

01:08:49.799 --> 01:08:52.158
I'm the one who's here. Me!

01:08:52.259 --> 01:08:55.345
It's okay. Don't worry

01:08:56.471 --> 01:08:57.680
Blacksta.

01:09:20.996 --> 01:09:22.497
Can I see her?

01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:29.607
Are you going?

01:10:32.776 --> 01:10:34.612
They're sending me to London.

01:10:44.246 --> 01:10:46.123
But you can stay here.

01:10:48.083 --> 01:10:50.361
Get to travel.

01:10:50.461 --> 01:10:52.463
Like what I always wanted.

01:10:53.839 --> 01:10:55.841
It's exactly what I wanted.

01:10:58.969 --> 01:11:00.971
That's what you always wanted?

01:11:04.975 --> 01:11:05.976
Yeah.

01:11:06.894 --> 01:11:08.170
Ziki.

01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:10.923
Kena, stop being naive.

01:11:11.023 --> 01:11:14.360
What did you expect
was going to happen either way?

01:11:17.404 --> 01:11:19.406
Were you planning to marry me?

01:11:20.741 --> 01:11:26.372
Are we going to have
this beautiful family?

01:11:28.832 --> 01:11:30.042
Yes.

01:11:37.633 --> 01:11:40.427
I want my normal life back.

01:11:43.222 --> 01:11:45.474
- Ziki--
- Kena, just stop it.

01:11:46.558 --> 01:11:48.310
How am I stopping you?

01:11:53.107 --> 01:11:54.316
Of course.

01:11:57.987 --> 01:12:01.348
You're just a typical Kenyan girl.

01:12:01.448 --> 01:12:04.159
Kena, get out! Please, just leave!

01:12:07.454 --> 01:12:08.956
Just go.

01:12:59.423 --> 01:13:01.425
Don't let me go.

01:13:03.302 --> 01:13:05.304
Please, Mummy, can I stay?

01:13:23.864 --> 01:13:26.492
Mum, please let me stay.

01:15:17.186 --> 01:15:19.188
Please give me your hand.

01:15:19.855 --> 01:15:22.424
Is this where you came to hide?

01:15:22.524 --> 01:15:24.067
Leave me alone.

01:15:24.943 --> 01:15:30.073
You will not touch me!

01:15:30.574 --> 01:15:35.245
If you need help,
just turn and press the bell.

01:15:37.498 --> 01:15:39.124
Just get out.

01:15:40.459 --> 01:15:41.835
Do you know she's back?

01:15:46.215 --> 01:15:47.508
Ziki Okemi.

01:15:49.176 --> 01:15:51.787
Ziki Okemi is back in Slopes.

01:15:51.887 --> 01:15:55.766
Did you hear me? She's back in Slopes.

01:16:52.614 --> 01:16:53.824
What's up?

01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:56.410
I'm cool.

01:17:00.539 --> 01:17:01.748
Mum?

01:18:37.094 --> 01:18:38.512
Kena.
