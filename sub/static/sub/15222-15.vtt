<i>Theorizing that one could time travel
within his own lifetime,</i>

00:05.739 --> 00:08.674
<i>Dr. Sam Beckett stepped
into the Quantum Leap accelerator...</i>

00:08.742 --> 00:10.733
<i>and vanished.</i>

00:16.015 --> 00:19.452
<i>He awoke to find himself
trapped in the past,</i>

00:19.519 --> 00:21.544
<i>facing mirror images
that were not his own...</i>

00:21.621 --> 00:26.854
<i>and driven by an unknown force
to change history for the better.</i>

00:26.926 --> 00:32.192
<i>His only guide on this journey is Al,
an observer from his own time,</i>

00:32.265 --> 00:36.634
<i>who appears in the form of a hologram
that only Sam can see and hear.</i>

00:36.703 --> 00:41.231
<i>And so, Dr. Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,</i>

00:42.442 --> 00:44.842
<i>striving to put right
what once went wrong...</i>

00:44.911 --> 00:47.436
<i>and hoping each time
that his next leap...</i>

00:47.514 --> 00:49.505
<i>will be the leap home.</i>

No. Oh, no!

01:14.541 --> 01:16.532
<i>Darling?</i>

01:18.978 --> 01:20.912
Did you sleep well?

01:21.981 --> 01:23.972
Oh, boy.

<i>Leaping in and out of new situations...</i>

02:45.231 --> 02:47.722

02:47.800 --> 02:50.064
<i>but I suddenly had the feeling
I had left "unusual';...</i>

02:50.136 --> 02:53.572
<i>and landed smack-dab
in the middle of"bizarre. "</i>

02:53.640 --> 02:56.131
The night is torrid.

02:58.444 --> 03:00.435
It's just as you said it would be.

03:00.513 --> 03:03.914
"It"?
Blood moon.

03:05.785 --> 03:10.586
<i>I don't think I ever really saw the world
until you showed it to me.</i>

03:10.657 --> 03:13.285
I don't pretend to understand
everything about you, Nigel.

03:13.359 --> 03:17.455
I only know that when you look at me,
I'm helpless.

03:18.498 --> 03:21.661
You've given me so much
in the short time we've known each other,

03:21.734 --> 03:25.431
and tonight, when the moon is high,

03:25.505 --> 03:29.271
I will return that love
a thousand times more.

03:38.351 --> 03:41.752
Nigel, did I say something
to offend you?

03:41.821 --> 03:44.551
No. No, no, no, no, no. No.

03:44.624 --> 03:46.558
No.

03:46.626 --> 03:48.560
Gosh, no. No.
I just, uh-

03:48.628 --> 03:50.721
Everything is fine.

03:50.797 --> 03:52.731
Really. It is.

04:03.142 --> 04:07.238
<i>Does the master wish
to inspect the livestock?</i>

04:08.314 --> 04:10.509
The, uh, livestock?

04:11.584 --> 04:14.417
I had Horst bring up some sheep
from the village.

04:14.487 --> 04:17.012
Oh. Sheep?

04:17.089 --> 04:19.183
For the ceremony.

04:19.259 --> 04:22.353
Right. Right, for-

04:22.428 --> 04:24.919
The sheep for the ceremony.

04:29.068 --> 04:31.263
Easy, uh, boy.
Vlad.

04:31.337 --> 04:34.033
Take it easy. Uh-huh.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.473
B- Be careful. That's a-

04:36.542 --> 04:39.033
He must sense your excitement.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.376
<i>I'll take him with me.</i>

04:41.447 --> 04:43.779
<i>Wait a second.
Wh- Where are you going?</i>

04:43.850 --> 04:46.717
I have to prepare.
The others will be arriving soon.

04:46.786 --> 04:48.720
Vlad?

04:50.790 --> 04:52.724
"Others"?

04:53.793 --> 04:55.852
This has got to be
some kind of a joke.

04:55.928 --> 05:00.524
Right? I'm in a castle, the coffin,
the whole storm and everything-

05:00.600 --> 05:02.898
Right? Horst?

05:02.969 --> 05:04.903
<i>Ah-</i>

05:14.147 --> 05:16.081
Uh, Horst?

05:16.149 --> 05:19.414
We're having, uh,
some kind of a party?

05:19.485 --> 05:21.578
Right? That's-That-

05:21.654 --> 05:23.747
Here. Let me help you.
Right? That's what's happening?

05:23.823 --> 05:26.587
We're just gonna have
some kind of a little, uh,

05:26.659 --> 05:28.889
party or something?

05:30.596 --> 05:33.793
Will the master be needing
anything else?

05:33.866 --> 05:37.495
"The master"?
Oh! The-The master.

05:37.570 --> 05:39.595
Um, well,

05:39.672 --> 05:41.663
uh, no.

05:41.741 --> 05:43.868
I just was wondering
about this, uh,

05:43.943 --> 05:48.903
this whole "Blood Moon,"
uh, ceremony- ceremony.

05:48.981 --> 05:52.246
Horst?

05:56.255 --> 05:58.189
Hello?

06:02.295 --> 06:04.490
Gee, I hope the sheep are okay.

06:11.304 --> 06:13.238
What's the matter?

06:15.308 --> 06:17.299
What are you trying to do,
give me a heart attack?

06:17.377 --> 06:21.074
Give you a heart
- I'm having a heart attack. All right, all right. Okay.

06:21.147 --> 06:24.082
Let me ask you this question.
Is it Halloween?

06:24.150 --> 06:26.243
What?

06:26.319 --> 06:28.287
Is it Halloween tonight?

06:28.354 --> 06:30.322
Not unless they moved it
to March.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.688
<i>Hmm.</i>

06:34.327 --> 06:36.318
Oh, uh, Sam-

06:36.396 --> 06:38.330
Hmm?
Sam, have you, uh-

06:38.398 --> 06:40.332
have you looked in a mirror yet?

06:40.400 --> 06:42.800
Uh, no. I have-

06:42.869 --> 06:44.928
No, I haven't seen any around.
Why?

06:45.004 --> 06:48.132
Ah. Haven't seen any mirrors around.
Well, that's not surprising.

06:48.207 --> 06:50.573
Well, what does that mean?

06:50.643 --> 06:52.770
What does that mean?
I think you've leaped into a-

06:52.845 --> 06:57.339
A what?
A vampire.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.351
A vampire?
I know. It sounds strange,

06:59.419 --> 07:01.751
but you should see the guy
in the waiting room.

07:01.821 --> 07:06.190
He looks like a cross between
Bela Lugosi and a sick corpse.

07:06.259 --> 07:09.194
He's got all the markings
of the undead.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.753
<i>And you have all
the markings of the brain-dead.</i>

07:11.831 --> 07:14.163
Now what does Ziggy have?

07:14.233 --> 07:17.396
Well, it's March 10, 1975-

07:17.470 --> 07:20.496
Yeah?
And you're just outside London.

07:20.573 --> 07:23.406
You leaped out of the country.
I figured that out already.

07:23.476 --> 07:25.535
Now, what else?
Yeah. Uh-

07:25.611 --> 07:28.102
Your name is Nigel Corrington.

07:28.181 --> 07:32.584
You're, uh, London's most
eccentric and expensive artist. Hmm.

07:32.652 --> 07:36.918
Your family has lived in this castle
for five generations.

07:36.989 --> 07:39.116
And you just shocked the art world...

07:39.192 --> 07:43.185
by marrying a homeless girl
named Alexandra Hill.

07:43.262 --> 07:45.526
Homeless girl?
Yeah.

07:45.598 --> 07:49.125
Uh-
Why am I here, Al?

07:49.202 --> 07:52.968
Uh, well, um, I don't know.

07:53.039 --> 07:55.530
We haven't run
the program that far yet.

07:55.608 --> 07:58.076
<i>Why not?</i>

07:58.144 --> 08:00.874
Oh, uh-
Because of the vampire?

08:00.947 --> 08:05.077
You're not running the program because
there's a vampire in the waiting room.

08:05.151 --> 08:08.382
Is that it? Is that what you're telling me? Wait
a minute. You should see this guy Corrington, Sam.

08:08.454 --> 08:11.048
He's- He's a first-class flesh eater.

08:11.123 --> 08:13.387
He's got all the classic signs.

08:13.459 --> 08:16.724
He's got the pale complexion,
the beady eyes,

08:16.796 --> 08:20.163
the lustful stare.
Al?

08:20.233 --> 08:23.566
You just described yourself.
Ha-ha! Very funny, Sam.

08:23.636 --> 08:25.570
Yeah. You're gonna laugh,
but I'm telling you,

08:25.638 --> 08:27.765
you have leaped into a night stalker.

08:27.840 --> 08:31.776
All right. All right. Now that's enough.
Now I want you to repeat after me.

08:31.844 --> 08:34.779
There is no such thing as a vampire.

08:34.847 --> 08:37.315
Oh, come on, Sam.
Say it.

08:39.018 --> 08:40.952
There's no such thing as a vampire.
Okay.

08:41.020 --> 08:44.080
It's all in my mind.
Go on.

08:44.155 --> 08:46.351
Uh, it's all in my mind.
Right.

08:46.425 --> 08:49.861
And I will never, ever bring up
the subject again.

08:50.963 --> 08:53.454
Sam-
Al?

08:53.533 --> 08:55.626
I'll never, ever bring up
the subject again. Okay.

08:55.701 --> 08:58.670
Now maybe we can get on
to figuring out why I'm here, okay?

08:58.738 --> 09:01.866
I'm just glad you didn't show up
when I was in the coffin.

09:01.941 --> 09:03.875
Aha! Aha! You see?
Ah!

09:03.943 --> 09:05.877
That's it. You're a-

09:05.945 --> 09:08.311
You're a blood-sucking
ghoul from hell. Go.

09:08.381 --> 09:11.976
Go away, and don't come back
until you find out why I'm here.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.616
Go on.

09:15.688 --> 09:20.955
Well, I just hope Tina remembered to
pick up my turtleneck from the cleaners.

09:27.800 --> 09:31.065
<i>There's something so powerful
in his eyes.</i>

09:32.638 --> 09:34.629
<i>Don't you think?</i>

09:34.707 --> 09:39.735
It's hard to believe he stood in
this very room over 300 years ago.

09:42.014 --> 09:45.245
Yes, well, I'm sure he'd be happy
to know that, uh-

09:45.318 --> 09:47.980
Nothing's changed since he left.

09:50.323 --> 09:52.484
Oh, here. Let me help you.

09:55.328 --> 09:58.263
Uh, I hope you don't mind
me wearing this dress.

09:58.331 --> 10:01.095
I found it in a trunk upstairs.

10:01.167 --> 10:03.761
It must have belonged
to your great-great-grandmother.

10:03.836 --> 10:05.929
Uh-huh.

10:06.005 --> 10:08.098
Alexandra, could I ask you
a question?

10:08.174 --> 10:11.610
Anything, darling.
Listen. It's about the coffin-

10:11.677 --> 10:13.611
Uh, I was just-

10:13.679 --> 10:17.945
<i>Well, I can't seem
to figure out why I was-</i>

10:18.017 --> 10:19.951
They're here.
Huh?

10:20.019 --> 10:22.112
Do I look all right?

10:22.188 --> 10:24.122
Yeah. You look wonderful.

10:24.190 --> 10:26.351
I want to make
a proper impression.

10:26.425 --> 10:29.758
After all, I'm the lady
of the castle now.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.734
Company, sir.

10:45.311 --> 10:48.474
Lord Corrington, it is an honor
to finally meet you.

10:48.547 --> 10:50.515
Yes. Well, hello.

10:50.583 --> 10:52.517
Thank you.

10:52.585 --> 10:55.418
Allow me to introduce myself
formally, sir. I'm Victor Drake.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.423
Uh, this is my companion, Claudia.

10:58.491 --> 11:03.394
My lord, it's an honor to join you
on this most sacred of nights.

11:05.998 --> 11:08.831
Yes, well, it's really nice
to have you here too with us.

11:08.901 --> 11:10.835
I must say,
I was quite surprised...

11:10.903 --> 11:12.894
when you responded favorably
to my letter requesting...

11:12.972 --> 11:17.375
the privilege of joining you
on the night of the Blood Moon.

11:17.443 --> 11:20.435
<i>Your name, sir, is legendary
among the followers.</i>

11:21.981 --> 11:26.418
<i>Although I never expected to encounter
such a vision ofbeauty...</i>

11:26.485 --> 11:30.012
<i>upon my arrival.</i>

11:34.694 --> 11:38.460
I'm sorry. This is my wife, uh, Alexandra.

11:46.038 --> 11:48.973
A pleasure.

11:51.544 --> 11:54.069
Shall we retire to the dining room?

11:55.648 --> 11:58.617
I believe dinner is nearly ready.

11:59.685 --> 12:03.485
That would be lovely.
I'm ravenous.

12:16.102 --> 12:18.070
It's quite impressive.

12:18.137 --> 12:21.106
I understand your family
has lived here for many years.

12:21.173 --> 12:23.437
So I've heard.

12:23.509 --> 12:26.603
I mean, yes, that's true,
of course.

12:26.679 --> 12:29.705
Nigel's great-great-grandfather
built the castle.

12:29.782 --> 12:31.943
There's a portrait of him
in the study.

12:32.017 --> 12:34.110
Perhaps you'd like to see it.

12:34.186 --> 12:36.347
I'd like that very much.

12:37.423 --> 12:40.688
<i>Uh, Sam?</i>

12:40.760 --> 12:43.957
Uh, I think we'd better
talk for a minute.

12:45.798 --> 12:48.028
Would you excuse me
for just a moment, please?

12:48.100 --> 12:51.501
I need to go, uh,
check on the dinner.

12:51.570 --> 12:53.834
Darling, I'm sure Horst
has everything under control.

12:53.906 --> 12:56.966
<i>Yes, I'm sure you're right, but
it never hurts to double-check.</i>

12:57.042 --> 13:01.035
You know? So, just-
just to be sure, I sometimes-

13:01.113 --> 13:03.104
I'll be right back.

13:04.984 --> 13:08.442
How's life in the netherworld?
What is that?

13:10.055 --> 13:11.989
This?
Yes, this.

13:12.057 --> 13:15.754
This is a cross.
No. That.

13:15.828 --> 13:18.422
It's garlic.
I know it's garlic.

13:18.497 --> 13:20.761
Why is it around your neck?
Hmm?

13:20.833 --> 13:22.767
Hmm?
No reason.

13:22.835 --> 13:25.395
No reason. I thought we had all
this vampire stuff settled, Al.

13:25.471 --> 13:28.133
Yeah, well, you may change your mind
after you find out why you're here.

13:28.207 --> 13:31.335
There's a 95.2% chance that
you're here to solve a murder.

13:31.410 --> 13:33.435
Murder? Who?
Yeah. Alexandra.

13:33.512 --> 13:36.072
Her body's found in the forest
in a couple of days.

13:36.148 --> 13:38.082
And that's not all.
What?

13:38.150 --> 13:40.710
When her body is found-

13:40.786 --> 13:43.016
What?
His-

13:43.088 --> 13:45.784
What?
It's completely...

13:47.026 --> 13:49.017
drained of blood.

13:59.238 --> 14:01.433
<i>What do you mean,
drained ofblood?</i>

14:01.507 --> 14:03.975
I mean drained. Emptied.

14:04.043 --> 14:06.739
<i>Sucked dry. Arroyo seco, Sam.</i>

14:06.812 --> 14:10.248
Admit it.
You have leaped into a-

14:10.316 --> 14:13.911
a vampire.
Oh, stop it with the garlic.

14:13.986 --> 14:18.252
Al, I cannot believe that there are guys
out there running around in bad tuxedos,

14:18.324 --> 14:20.758
biting people on the neck.

14:20.826 --> 14:23.124
Now, there's gotta be
a more logical explanation.

14:23.195 --> 14:26.096
What's logical about the walking dead?

14:26.165 --> 14:29.032
Why is it difficult for you
to admit that I could be right?

14:29.101 --> 14:31.069
Because it's insane, that's why.

14:31.136 --> 14:35.232
I'm a scientist. I deal in facts, not
fiction. Aha! All right. All right.

14:35.307 --> 14:39.607
Explain the fact that you
woke up in a coffin.

14:39.678 --> 14:42.738
<i>Well, that's easy to explain.</i>

14:42.815 --> 14:45.579
Yeah? It's easy to explain?
Go ahead. Explain it.

14:45.651 --> 14:47.812
Go ahead.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.447
A marketing ploy.
What?

14:50.522 --> 14:54.583
Yes. Yes. Corrington
is a painter, right? So?

14:54.660 --> 14:59.222
Right?
Well, he probably lives this bizarre lifestyle...

14:59.298 --> 15:01.459
to drive up the price of his work.

15:01.533 --> 15:03.694
People love quirky,
especially when it comes to art.

15:03.769 --> 15:05.896
Now, you gotta admit
I'm right there.

15:05.971 --> 15:08.235
What about the murder?

15:10.042 --> 15:11.976
I don't know, Al.

15:12.044 --> 15:14.911
Does Ziggy have anything else?

15:14.980 --> 15:18.381
No, nothing. She's trying to interface
with some of the British systems,

15:18.450 --> 15:21.078
but it shouldn't be much longer.

15:21.153 --> 15:24.987
Have Ziggy run a check
on something called "Blood Moon. "

15:25.057 --> 15:27.252
Blood Moon.

15:27.326 --> 15:32.593
B- Blood- Bl-Blood Moon? What
the hell is that, "Blood Moon"?

15:32.665 --> 15:34.690
It's some kind of a cult ritual thing.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.065
And also, have her run a check
on Victor Drake.

15:37.136 --> 15:39.127
Uh, that guy in there?
Yeah, yeah.

15:39.204 --> 15:41.695
He and his girlfriend are big
fans of mine- Corrington's-

15:41.774 --> 15:45.710
and I guess they're here
to celebrate this Blood Moon ritual.

15:45.778 --> 15:49.214
You think Alexandra's part of this cult?
No, I don't think so.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.715
What's she hanging out
with a guy like Corrington for?

15:51.784 --> 15:53.911
Look. You told me she was
a street kid, right?

15:53.986 --> 15:56.887
She came from the streets. Now she's
all of a sudden queen of her own castle.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.049
Now, who'd wanna give that up?
Uh-

15:59.124 --> 16:03.117
And as hard as it is to believe, I think
that she really loves this Corrington guy.

16:04.463 --> 16:07.227
Okay, Sam. Just-
Just be careful, okay?

16:07.299 --> 16:11.360
Al
- Be careful because this leap is getting weirder by the minute.

16:15.741 --> 16:18.403
<i>May I propose a toast?</i>

16:18.477 --> 16:20.741
<i>To stab the hearts
of mortal men,</i>

16:20.813 --> 16:23.077
<i>they spill their blood
like rain.</i>

16:23.148 --> 16:26.015
<i>And to the night
we offer ours,</i>

16:26.085 --> 16:29.077
to demons without shame.

16:29.154 --> 16:31.145
To the Blood Moon.

16:31.223 --> 16:34.283
The Blood Moon.
The Blood Moon.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.159
To the m-moon.

16:55.180 --> 16:59.173
<i>Sorry. I wasn't paying attention.
I should have been.</i>

16:59.251 --> 17:03.210
<i>I believe my husband is more excited
than he dare admit.</i>

17:03.288 --> 17:05.848
<i>He hasn't been himself all evening.
Is that right?</i>

17:05.924 --> 17:10.452
- Nothing serious, I hope.
- No, no. Just kind of one of those days.

17:10.529 --> 17:14.089
- I trust everything's been prepared for the ceremony.
- Ceremony?

17:14.165 --> 17:17.602
Must be very satisfying
to experience such a sacred event...

17:17.669 --> 17:21.695
with such a hauntingly
beautiful creature.

17:24.476 --> 17:26.535
You flatter me, Mr. Drake.

17:28.012 --> 17:30.140
I worship you, Lady Corrington.

17:34.319 --> 17:38.085
To be honest, I'm not quite sure
what to expect.

17:38.157 --> 17:43.322
I know that the ritual involves
some kind of...

17:43.395 --> 17:45.920
- sacrifice.
- An offering...

17:47.699 --> 17:49.758
to the beast.

17:52.638 --> 17:54.629
It's quite simple, really.

17:56.008 --> 17:58.169
Within each of us...

17:59.611 --> 18:01.670
there lives a beast-

18:03.348 --> 18:05.282
a power.

18:06.952 --> 18:10.319
<i>Some... choose to fear it.</i>

18:12.791 --> 18:15.191
Others, to deny it.

18:18.497 --> 18:21.728
Then there are others...

18:21.800 --> 18:24.166
who seek to embrace it-

18:25.237 --> 18:27.000
<i>to feed off it.</i>

18:29.608 --> 18:34.136
As with everything,
there is a price to be paid-

18:39.585 --> 18:42.076
A sacrifice to be made.

18:49.094 --> 18:52.325
We have hours before the moon is high.

18:54.766 --> 18:57.894
<i>Shall we move to the study
for cognac?</i>

18:59.771 --> 19:01.830
Perfect.

19:02.908 --> 19:05.035
No. Uh, no.

19:05.110 --> 19:09.638
I feel like we-
we should clear the table first.

19:09.715 --> 19:12.206
You know? I'm sure your
domestic can attend to it.

19:12.284 --> 19:14.878
Well, I'd rather do it myself.

19:19.358 --> 19:21.690
Alexandra, would you
give me a hand?

19:24.630 --> 19:26.621
<i>Alexandra?</i>

19:28.467 --> 19:30.731
<i>Sorry. There we go.</i>

19:31.803 --> 19:35.933
We'll have this all cleaned up
in no time. Just the two of us.

19:46.151 --> 19:49.086
Nigel, what's come over you?
Me? Nothing.

19:49.154 --> 19:51.247
I just felt like you could use
some fresh air.

19:51.323 --> 19:54.588
You seemed a little,
uh, distracted.

19:54.660 --> 19:58.096
<i>It's the ceremony-</i>

19:58.163 --> 20:00.597
You're having
second thoughts, aren't you?

20:00.666 --> 20:05.433
Well, as a matter of fact, I am.

20:05.504 --> 20:08.098
I knew it.

20:08.173 --> 20:10.437
You don't think I'm worthy.

20:10.509 --> 20:12.443
What?

20:12.511 --> 20:14.945
It's because of my past,
isn't it?

20:17.182 --> 20:21.448
Nigel, you're the only one
I care for.

20:23.055 --> 20:26.491
I want to be part of your world.

20:26.558 --> 20:29.959
Why? You're so young
and you're so alive.

20:30.028 --> 20:33.623
It has to be terribly lonely for you,
living here like this.

20:40.973 --> 20:43.601
I never knew my mother and father.

20:45.811 --> 20:48.905
They left me in a boot box
on the steps of a small church...

20:48.981 --> 20:52.280
when I was only a few hours old.

20:55.988 --> 20:57.956
I grew up in a room...

20:58.023 --> 21:01.220
with 20 other girls just like me-

21:02.995 --> 21:05.020
20 lost souls.

21:08.500 --> 21:11.765
When I left there,

21:11.837 --> 21:14.499
I lived on the streets.

21:16.174 --> 21:18.768
Until I met you,

21:18.844 --> 21:22.211
I was sure I would die alone.

21:25.684 --> 21:28.278
Please.

21:28.353 --> 21:31.584
Don't make me die alone.

21:35.694 --> 21:37.958
Alexandra-

21:38.030 --> 21:40.396
I really think we should
call off the ceremony.

21:40.465 --> 21:42.399
Call it off?

21:42.467 --> 21:45.231
But the moon won't be like this for another
- Forget about the moon.

21:45.304 --> 21:48.364
I'm talking about your life.
I don't understand.

21:48.440 --> 21:52.069
I hope you're not planning to monopolize
your lovely wife all evening, milord.

21:52.144 --> 21:54.169
I don't mean to intrude,

21:54.246 --> 21:57.977
but I was hoping I could
present you with a gift.

21:58.050 --> 22:00.075
A gift?

22:00.152 --> 22:02.643
Darling, isn't that wonderful?

22:08.460 --> 22:10.894
<i>It's so beautiful.</i>

22:10.962 --> 22:14.830
Wherever did you find it? I
bought it from an old peddler.

22:14.900 --> 22:17.198
It belonged to Count Bathory himself.

22:17.269 --> 22:19.260
I've never seen
anything like it.

22:19.338 --> 22:22.603
It must be worth a fortune.
At least.

22:22.674 --> 22:25.165
Victor is a very generous man.

22:28.680 --> 22:31.171
It pleases you, Lord Corrington?

22:31.249 --> 22:34.116
Yes, this is a very generous gift, but...

22:34.186 --> 22:36.450
<i>I can't accept it.
I insist.</i>

22:36.521 --> 22:39.285
<i>I'm sure you'll find it
very useful in the future.</i>

22:39.358 --> 22:42.225
<i>Yes, well, I'm sure it has a great deal
of sentimental value for you.</i>

22:42.294 --> 22:44.888
Value can only be measured
by the individual.

22:44.963 --> 22:47.363
Don't you agree?

22:55.207 --> 22:57.607
<i>Are you all right?</i>

22:57.676 --> 23:00.201
Will you excuse me for a moment?

23:02.114 --> 23:04.412
Alexandra?

23:04.483 --> 23:06.610
I need to freshen up.

23:10.322 --> 23:12.449
I can see why you chose her.

23:12.524 --> 23:15.254
She's really quite vulnerable,
isn't she?

23:15.327 --> 23:17.955
We're all vulnerable
in our own way.

23:18.029 --> 23:20.020
So we are.

23:21.066 --> 23:23.193
We have hours before the ritual.

23:23.268 --> 23:26.431
I wonder if I might bother you
for a more secluded location,

23:26.505 --> 23:28.905
where we can prepare.

23:30.008 --> 23:31.976
Yes. There's some rooms upstairs.

23:32.043 --> 23:35.604
I'll have Horst take you up.
I don't think that'll be possible.

23:35.680 --> 23:38.274
I took the liberty
of excusing him for the evening.

23:38.350 --> 23:40.910
I hope you don't mind.

23:41.987 --> 23:44.785
Uh, well, I guess, uh-

23:44.856 --> 23:47.757
Join us.
What?

23:47.826 --> 23:50.158
I want to bathe in your power.

23:51.696 --> 23:53.630
You do?

23:53.698 --> 23:56.064
I can assure you,
Claudia is quite...

23:56.134 --> 23:58.500
energetic.

23:58.570 --> 24:02.336
Yes, well, I'm... sure she is.

24:02.407 --> 24:05.240
Some other time perhaps.

24:07.012 --> 24:08.946
Of course.

24:14.853 --> 24:16.844
<i>Well, that proves it.</i>

24:16.922 --> 24:20.255
They are definitely vampires.

24:20.325 --> 24:22.850
What are you talking about? I'm talk
- Look at this.

24:22.928 --> 24:26.455
<i>Proves
- "How to Spot a Vampire, by Dr. Laszlo Fang"?</i>

24:26.531 --> 24:28.465
Where did you get that?
It's not funny.

24:28.533 --> 24:30.467
<i>Where'd you get this book?
This is one of the-</i>

24:30.535 --> 24:33.197
This is the world's
foremost expert on vampires.

24:33.271 --> 24:35.603
<i>Oh, that Dr. Laszlo Fang.
Yes. Yes. Now listen to this.</i>

24:35.674 --> 24:38.142
Please, read something to me. I'm
gonna quote to you from chapter six.

24:38.210 --> 24:40.701
Please. Please do.
All right. Shush. Listen.

24:40.779 --> 24:44.215
<i>"Vampires are not merely
blood seekers. Oh, no.</i>

24:44.282 --> 24:47.649
"They are sexually obsessed,

24:47.719 --> 24:51.883
"and many of them possess
insatiable carnal urges...

24:51.957 --> 24:54.016
beyond the grave. "

24:54.092 --> 24:58.188
Now, what does that tell ya? It tells me that
vampires and holograms have a lot in common.

24:59.631 --> 25:01.690
Ha-ha-ha.

25:01.766 --> 25:04.428
You are not gonna laugh
when I tell you about the-

25:04.503 --> 25:08.269
- the Blood Moon.
- What about it?

25:08.340 --> 25:10.274
Yeah, the Blood Moon.
The Blood Moon-

25:10.342 --> 25:12.902
It's this very sacred night that
happens once every 10 years...

25:12.978 --> 25:15.469
when the walking dead...

25:15.547 --> 25:18.175
honor the name of Count Bathory.

25:18.250 --> 25:20.912
Victor mentioned Bathory.
Count Bathory-

25:20.986 --> 25:24.752
Yeah. This is one of the first
vampires in recorded history.

25:26.157 --> 25:29.251
Legend has it that he was
personally responsible...

25:29.327 --> 25:34.424
for the ritualistic deaths
of 650 virgins.

25:34.499 --> 25:36.797
He believed that their blood
would rejuvenate him...

25:36.868 --> 25:38.802
and give him eternal life.
Al-

25:38.870 --> 25:41.031
Well, they caught this guy,
and when they caught him...

25:41.106 --> 25:45.133
the townspeople walled him up
inside his own bedroom.

25:45.210 --> 25:47.201
Hmm.
And he lived in there.

25:47.279 --> 25:51.443
He stayed alive for three years
drinking his own blood.

25:51.516 --> 25:53.450
That was in the book?
Huh? Yeah.

25:53.518 --> 25:55.452
This Dr. Laszlo Fang book? Yeah,
and they say that that night-

25:55.520 --> 25:58.045
This is a good book. I gotta read
this. They say that that night...

25:58.123 --> 26:01.615
the moon turned blood red.

26:01.693 --> 26:04.719
And ever since then,
it's been required for the vampires...

26:04.796 --> 26:06.957
to offer up a sacrifice
in his name.

26:07.032 --> 26:10.490
<i>- And this is what Ziggy thinks happened to Alexandra?
- You tell me.</i>

26:10.569 --> 26:14.562
According to Scotland Yard, the cause
of death was acute loss of blood...

26:14.639 --> 26:17.699
due to a puncture wound
in the carotid artery,

26:17.776 --> 26:20.244
which is right- right here.

26:20.312 --> 26:22.610
<i>I know where that is, okay?
Yes. Yes.</i>

26:22.681 --> 26:25.377
Yeah, and the murder weapon
was found near the body.

26:25.450 --> 26:27.441
It was a silver dagger.

26:29.654 --> 26:32.350
- A what?
- A silver dagger.

26:38.196 --> 26:40.130
Something like this?

26:51.843 --> 26:54.710
<i>Are you saying that Corrington
sacrificed his own wife?</i>

26:54.779 --> 26:56.713
No.
No?

26:56.781 --> 27:00.012
No. No, if it was Corrington, then history
would have changed as soon as I got here,

27:00.085 --> 27:02.553
because I'm him and I'm not
gonna kill her, right?

27:02.621 --> 27:05.454
Right. Well, wait a minute.

27:07.192 --> 27:09.126
Al-
Uh, wait. Let me check-

27:09.194 --> 27:12.391
Oh! Drake.
Well, of course Drake.

27:12.464 --> 27:16.127
But do we have anything on
this guy yet? Uh, well, no.

27:16.201 --> 27:19.728
It's these English frequencies. This
country hasn't been the same since the Blitz.

27:19.804 --> 27:21.999
Al, this is crazy-
this whole leap.

27:22.073 --> 27:26.976
I leap in, and I'm in the middle of a Stephen
King novel. I don't even know what I look like.

27:27.045 --> 27:30.242
- Oh, well, that's no problem.
- What do you mean?

27:30.315 --> 27:33.910
You wanna know what you look like, just
look at the portrait over the fireplace.

27:33.985 --> 27:36.749
What are you talking about?
What am I talking about?

27:36.821 --> 27:39.153
Yeah. That's the guy in the
waiting room. That's you.

27:39.224 --> 27:43.888
No, no. That's impossible. Alexandra told me
that that guy has been dead for over 300 years.

27:43.962 --> 27:46.590
Dead... or undead?

27:46.665 --> 27:48.860
Don't start with that again, Al.

27:48.933 --> 27:53.029
Sam, you've been here long enough. You gonna
tell me there's nothing weird going on here?

27:53.104 --> 27:55.368
Weird, yes. Living dead, no.

27:55.440 --> 27:57.840
Now what is it gonna take
to convince you of that?

28:02.213 --> 28:05.546
This is ridiculous, Al,
absolutely ridiculous.

28:05.617 --> 28:10.179
But if this is what it takes to prove
that he's not undead, then I'm gonna do it.

28:17.529 --> 28:19.724
Good, Sam.

28:30.308 --> 28:33.573
<i>There it is.
Yeah. I know "there it is. "</i>

28:33.645 --> 28:35.670
Well, I guess I'll open it then.

28:36.681 --> 28:38.649
I guess so.

28:40.585 --> 28:44.214
When you see his bones in here, I don't
wanna hear anything more about vampires.

28:46.291 --> 28:48.885
Alexandra!

28:50.195 --> 28:53.596
Gooshie, get me the hell
out of here!

28:57.936 --> 28:59.904
What is it? What's wrong?

29:04.175 --> 29:06.109
Uh-huh.

29:13.051 --> 29:14.985
No.

29:20.825 --> 29:25.455
<i>Look at his throat, Al. I see. The
throat. What's left of the throat.</i>

29:29.134 --> 29:31.728
Who could have done
something like this?

29:31.803 --> 29:35.398
Maybe it wasn't a who.
Maybe it was a what.

29:35.473 --> 29:37.464
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

29:41.780 --> 29:44.146
I heard a scream.

29:54.993 --> 29:57.689
How did it happen?

29:57.762 --> 30:00.390
I was just about to ask you the same question.

30:00.465 --> 30:04.060
You don't think I had anything
to do with this?

30:11.509 --> 30:14.603
Alexandra must be very upset.

30:14.679 --> 30:16.977
Perhaps I should speak to her.

30:17.048 --> 30:19.243
She's my wife. I'll handle it.

30:24.022 --> 30:26.013
Of course.

30:26.090 --> 30:29.184
I'll await you both
in the study.

30:41.973 --> 30:44.567
Alexandra?
I'm sorry I ran off.

30:44.642 --> 30:47.133
I couldn't bear to look at-

30:49.314 --> 30:51.407
It must have been terrible,
finding him like that.

30:51.482 --> 30:54.974
I don't understand. Who could
have done something like this?

30:55.053 --> 30:57.044
I don't know.

30:59.824 --> 31:02.759
Listen, I-I've been thinking
about tonight.

31:02.827 --> 31:06.024
I think we should call off
the ceremony.

31:06.097 --> 31:09.430
Because of this?
Because of a lot of things.

31:09.500 --> 31:11.764
But it's so important to you.

31:11.836 --> 31:15.272
It's what you've waited for
ever since we met.

31:15.340 --> 31:17.831
It's all you've talked about.

31:19.844 --> 31:22.335
Well, it's not as important as you are.

31:27.185 --> 31:30.279
I don't understand you.

31:30.355 --> 31:34.121
You're at once frightening
and exciting.

31:34.192 --> 31:37.457
I find myself wanting to run away,

31:37.528 --> 31:41.089
yet I'm drawn to you
like no other.

31:43.301 --> 31:45.531
You've gotta trust me on this.

31:47.972 --> 31:50.406
What about the others?
They're in the study.

31:50.475 --> 31:52.443
I'll go tell them.

31:52.510 --> 31:55.035
I'll come with you.
Are you sure?

31:56.981 --> 31:59.506
<i>Yes.</i>

32:07.859 --> 32:09.952
<i>Lady Corrington-
I hope you're feeling better.</i>

32:10.028 --> 32:11.962
Yes, thank you.

32:12.030 --> 32:15.295
The moon is nearly high.
We have much to do.

32:16.501 --> 32:18.628
I've decided to call off the ritual.

32:20.838 --> 32:23.432
This is quite unexpected.

32:23.508 --> 32:26.136
Are you sure that there's nothing
I can say to change your mind?

32:26.210 --> 32:28.269
Yes, I'm sure.

32:29.347 --> 32:34.546
- Well, then. I think we should be going.
- I think that would be best.

32:37.855 --> 32:40.085
I hope, at least, you will allow me...

32:40.158 --> 32:42.649
the honor of a final toast.

32:45.463 --> 32:49.866
Well, uh, under the circumstances,
I suppose it's the least we can do.

32:50.868 --> 32:53.837
What shall we drink to?
Destiny.

32:55.974 --> 32:58.340
Destiny.

33:16.494 --> 33:18.724
Alexandra? Are you-

33:22.834 --> 33:24.768
Alex-

33:32.010 --> 33:34.001
Well,

33:34.078 --> 33:36.069
the count will be pleased.

33:36.147 --> 33:39.207
Instead of one offering,
we shall give him... two.

33:48.059 --> 33:51.119
<i>You greatly
disappoint me, Corrington.</i>

33:51.195 --> 33:53.891
I must admit, I never imagined you
the type to fall for a pretty face-

33:53.965 --> 33:57.059
especially one
with such a sordid pedigree.

33:57.135 --> 34:00.070
You drugged me.

34:00.138 --> 34:04.074
You'll wish you'd stayed drugged
before this night is over.

34:04.142 --> 34:06.736
You've done a very foolish thing.

34:06.811 --> 34:11.440
The count will be displeased
with your lack of commitment.

34:11.516 --> 34:14.110
Where is Alexandra?

34:14.185 --> 34:17.746
She's tied up at the moment.
Don't worry.

34:17.822 --> 34:20.154
Soon you'll be together again...

34:21.458 --> 34:23.449
for eternity.

34:23.527 --> 34:25.962
<i>What do you want?
Isn't it obvious?</i>

34:26.030 --> 34:28.429
I want your soul-

34:28.498 --> 34:31.797
more directly, your blood.

34:31.869 --> 34:34.337
<i>You can't be serious.
I'm more than serious.</i>

34:34.405 --> 34:36.839
- I'm compelled.
- But that's murder.

34:36.908 --> 34:38.842
Nonsense!

34:38.909 --> 34:40.878
The soul can never die.

34:40.945 --> 34:42.936
It can only be...

34:43.014 --> 34:45.447
reinvented.

34:48.652 --> 34:50.587
My dear,

34:50.655 --> 34:52.589
we've been waiting for you.

35:08.306 --> 35:11.241
The moon is high, my love.

35:11.309 --> 35:14.767
Yes. It's time.

35:29.060 --> 35:30.994
I envy you.

35:31.062 --> 35:33.496
Soon you'll know the secrets
beyond the grave.

35:41.772 --> 35:45.230
Claudia, you have to untie me.
Victor's gonna kill Alexandra.

35:45.309 --> 35:47.402
<i>I've gotta stop him.
You heard him.</i>

35:48.713 --> 35:50.874
He said you were the chosen one-

35:50.948 --> 35:53.416
the one that would take us
through the forest.

35:54.785 --> 35:57.879
But you're just like the others.

35:57.955 --> 36:00.685
You're weak and afraid.

36:00.758 --> 36:03.352
This is not some gothic novel.
This is real life.

36:03.427 --> 36:05.554
And unless you untie me,
innocent people are gonna die.

36:05.630 --> 36:07.996
It's too late.

36:08.065 --> 36:10.727
Tonight will see the evil of man reborn.

36:12.069 --> 36:14.503
Victor says our fates
are preordained.

36:14.572 --> 36:18.269
I don't know how to break this to you,
but Victor is insane.

36:18.342 --> 36:20.276
Victor is a genius!

36:20.344 --> 36:22.369
He is my king.

36:23.648 --> 36:26.344
And soon... he will be yours.

36:36.127 --> 36:39.528
- Al!
- Oh, my God, Sam!

36:39.597 --> 36:42.065
<i>Sam
- Al. Shh.</i>

36:42.133 --> 36:45.864
Don't speak. I want you
to hear the sound of our union.

36:45.937 --> 36:48.963
- No, don't do this.
- It's already done.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.201
<i>She's a vampire.!
Oh, no, Sam, do something.!</i>

36:57.048 --> 36:59.539
- Horst.
- Are you all right, sir?

36:59.617 --> 37:02.051
Thank God you came back. I thought
you'd gone home for the evening.

37:02.119 --> 37:04.383
- Forgot my cap, sir.
- Where's Alexandra?

37:04.455 --> 37:07.947
- I don't know, sir.
- I can't get a fix on her. Must be the lightning.

37:08.025 --> 37:09.993
Go find her, Al.
All right. Gooshie.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.154
Center me on Alexandra.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.357
Horst, I want you to go to
town and get help. But, sir-

37:14.432 --> 37:16.423
Go!
Yes, sir.

37:24.642 --> 37:26.837
You're not real.

37:28.012 --> 37:29.980
And I'll prove it.

37:41.158 --> 37:44.252
<i>They're fake.</i>

37:44.328 --> 37:48.196
Huh? What's fake? Your vampires are fake,
unless they got a dental plan in hell.

37:48.266 --> 37:51.531
Now, did you find Alexandra? Yeah, yeah.
Victor's got her staked up on the roof.

37:51.602 --> 37:55.504
You better hurry up
because he's gonna start the service.

37:55.573 --> 37:58.041
It's just as it was
in the beginning,

37:58.109 --> 38:00.202
when Bathory ruled the night.

38:00.278 --> 38:03.372
I've awaited this moment
my entire life-

38:03.447 --> 38:06.473
to bridge the gap
between the living and the dead,

38:06.550 --> 38:10.714
to fly with fallen angels
and to soar into the night.

38:10.788 --> 38:16.124
And you-
oh, you shall be my wings.

38:16.193 --> 38:19.390
So delicate, so fragile.

38:19.463 --> 38:22.728
And soon you will be...

38:22.800 --> 38:25.530
with the master.

38:25.603 --> 38:27.537
<i>Victor.</i>

38:27.605 --> 38:29.539
Stay where you are.

38:29.607 --> 38:31.905
I know you want to believe...

38:31.976 --> 38:33.910
that this is all real,

38:35.379 --> 38:37.347
but we both know the truth.

38:37.415 --> 38:39.474
What are you talking about?

38:42.420 --> 38:44.547
You killed her.

38:44.622 --> 38:47.250
No.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.486
But I'll kill you if I have to.

38:49.560 --> 38:51.551
You still don't understand, do you?

38:51.629 --> 38:53.563
<i>You can't change this.</i>

38:53.631 --> 38:58.330
- Why do you reject your own destiny?
- Because it's wrong.

38:59.637 --> 39:03.073
<i>End this, Victor. Let her go.</i>

39:03.140 --> 39:06.667
Yes. She shall be released.

39:10.481 --> 39:12.949
We shall all be released.

39:17.922 --> 39:19.913
Pass softly,

39:21.459 --> 39:23.654
my love.

39:26.263 --> 39:28.390
No!

39:45.149 --> 39:48.676
The young lady has indeed
confirmed your version of the story,

39:48.753 --> 39:53.247
and, uh, seeing as you and your family
have lived her for many years,

39:53.324 --> 39:56.782
I really don't see much point
in bringing you in at the present time.

39:56.861 --> 40:00.820
Would you mind waiting, though, for a
few minutes? I'd like to talk to my wife.

40:00.898 --> 40:03.594
I don't see any harm in that.
Thank you.

40:09.340 --> 40:13.936
Well, it, uh, certainly looks
as though the storm has passed.

40:14.011 --> 40:16.036
Yes, I sure hope so.

40:16.113 --> 40:18.104
Yes, indeed.

40:23.554 --> 40:28.150
Al, I don't think she should be here
when Corrington gets back, do you?

40:28.225 --> 40:30.591
No, of course not.

40:36.901 --> 40:39.495
Alexandra.

40:39.570 --> 40:41.663
Uh, are you all right?

40:48.913 --> 40:51.143
I've been thinking.

40:52.917 --> 40:55.215
I think you should leave here.

40:57.087 --> 40:59.021
Leave?

41:01.926 --> 41:04.326
You don't belong here.

41:08.499 --> 41:10.524
You don't belong here.

41:10.601 --> 41:14.002
And what happened tonight
should convince you of that.

41:25.483 --> 41:28.316
I know. I know.

41:36.026 --> 41:38.051
Where shall I go?

41:42.967 --> 41:45.936
I want you to take this,
and sell it.

41:46.003 --> 41:47.971
You should get
a lot of money for it.

41:48.038 --> 41:50.199
And I want you to go
as far away as you can from here.

41:50.274 --> 41:52.435
You hear me?

41:52.510 --> 41:54.501
Please.

41:57.147 --> 41:59.115
Please.

42:04.688 --> 42:07.088
Now go on.

42:07.157 --> 42:10.126
The police are waiting
to take you to town. Go.

42:18.135 --> 42:21.502
I don't think I'll ever
understand any of this,

42:24.174 --> 42:26.938
but I'll love you for all eternity.

42:35.185 --> 42:39.053
Don't feel bad, Sam.
You didn't have any choice.

42:39.123 --> 42:41.387
You couldn't leave her
with that-

42:41.458 --> 42:43.483
<i>that that.</i>

42:46.630 --> 42:48.825
Anyway,

42:48.899 --> 42:51.629
Ziggy says she's fine.
She's- She's just fine.

42:51.702 --> 42:53.966
She doesn't end up
on the street again, right?

42:54.038 --> 42:56.632
Well, yeah. She-
Yeah, she ends up on the street.

42:56.707 --> 42:58.971
But-
She becomes a missionary...

42:59.043 --> 43:01.341
<i>on the street, see.
A missionary?</i>

43:01.412 --> 43:04.575
She's fine.

43:04.648 --> 43:07.811
A missionary.

43:07.885 --> 43:11.981
Hmm?

43:12.056 --> 43:13.921
Ha-ha, what?

43:13.991 --> 43:17.119
You gotta be feeling a little silly
right now, huh?

43:17.194 --> 43:21.290
You know, with your garlic and your cross and all
that stuff, considering how everything turned out.

43:21.365 --> 43:26.997
I wondered how long it would take you
before you'd try and rub my nose in that.

43:27.071 --> 43:31.804
- I don't wanna be an I-told-you-so.
- No. I just got a little-

43:31.875 --> 43:33.866
little carried away.

43:33.944 --> 43:36.640
- "A little carried away"? Al!
- Yeah. Just a little.

43:36.714 --> 43:38.978
You were scared to death.
"A little carried away. "

43:39.049 --> 43:41.449
I just hope that this proves to you,
once and for all,

43:41.518 --> 43:44.646
that there are no such things
as vampires.

43:46.090 --> 43:49.856
<i>Hmm.! Okay?</i>

43:51.629 --> 43:53.859
Okay.

43:56.133 --> 43:58.658
I'll finally find out
what I look like.

44:11.982 --> 44:13.973
Al?

44:27.631 --> 44:30.429
Ohh,

44:30.501 --> 44:32.662
boy!
