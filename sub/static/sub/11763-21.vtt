WEBVTT

00:01.232 --> 00:04.135
YOU KNOW HOW I USUALLY
LOVE YOUR IDEAS?
NO.

00:04.135 --> 00:06.277
RIGHT.
WELL, THE IDEA OF US

00:06.277 --> 00:08.279
ALL VACATIONING TOGETHER
IS SO BAD,

00:08.279 --> 00:11.742
I'M MAKING UP A WORD--
GAG-BYSMAL.

00:11.742 --> 00:13.344
FAMILIES VACATION TOGETHER,

00:13.344 --> 00:16.217
AND WE ARE JUST LIKE
ANY OTHER FAMILY.

00:16.217 --> 00:18.119
WE GOT THE DREAMER, THE SCHEMER,
THE QUEEN BEE,

00:18.119 --> 00:20.121
THE DAMAGED GOODS,
THE IRON FIST,

00:20.121 --> 00:22.093
AND THE ONE
WE ALL FEEL SORRY FOR.

00:22.093 --> 00:24.295
WELL, ONE WHICH AM I?
(all speaking at once)

00:24.295 --> 00:27.098
NO, NO, GUYS.
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU.
BOO!

00:27.098 --> 00:30.131
PIPE DOWN, DAMAGED GOODS.
KNEW IT.

00:30.131 --> 00:33.264
IF WE GO ON A TRIP, IT SHOULD BE
SOMEPLACE INCREDIBLE, LIKE...

00:33.264 --> 00:35.406
FRANCE.
CRACKER JACK FACTORY.

00:35.406 --> 00:38.269
CRACKER JACK FACTORY?!
FRANCE?!

00:38.269 --> 00:40.211
WHAT IF WE GO
TO THE WINE COUNTRY?
(Andy) I'M IN.

00:40.211 --> 00:42.343
DONE.
LIKE IT.

00:42.343 --> 00:45.146
FOR SURE. MISTER, WE'RE GONNA
SEE WHERE YOU WERE BORN.

00:45.146 --> 00:48.479
WE ARE GONNA POUND SO MUCH
GRAPE. WE SHOULD GET A DRIVER.

00:48.479 --> 00:51.082
SINCE TRAV DROPPED OUT
OF COLLEGE, HE'S FREE.

00:51.082 --> 00:52.683
(laughs)
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

00:52.683 --> 00:54.655
NO, IT'S OKAY. I'M COOLIO.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.657
NO ONE WHO SAYS "COOLIO"
IS COOL.

00:56.657 --> 01:00.561
THAT'S WHY COOLIO'S
NAMED COOLIO.
OH, FINE. I'M NOT COOLIO.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.563
YEAH, I'LL FINALLY GET
MY LIFE TOGETHER

01:02.563 --> 01:04.565
AND GET MY OWN APARTMENT,

01:04.565 --> 01:07.568
THEN TRAV JUST SLIDES RIGHT IN
AND BECOMES ME.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.700
(sighs)

01:09.700 --> 01:11.102
MAMA-SAN.

01:12.443 --> 01:14.475
MUST BE TIME
FOR MY DAILY SCOLDING.

01:14.475 --> 01:18.179
LOOK AT YOU. YOU'VE TURNED INTO
SOME KIND OF NE'ER-DO-WELL.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.450
WHAT'S THAT?

01:19.450 --> 01:22.413
I DON'T KNOW. SOMETHING THAT
ELLIE CALLED HIM.
OH.

01:22.413 --> 01:25.186
IT'S AN IRRESPONSIBLE,
IDLE PERSON.

01:25.186 --> 01:27.218
WELL, THEN YOU'RE
KING NE'ER-DO-WELL.

01:27.218 --> 01:29.590
NAILED IT.
THANKS.

01:29.590 --> 01:33.093
SO I CALLED YOUR COLLEGE
AND SAID YOU LEFT SCHOOL

01:33.093 --> 01:35.166
BECAUSE YOUR GRANDMOTHER
HAS SYPHILIS. IT'S OKAY.

01:35.166 --> 01:37.328
THERE'S A LITTLE TRUTH TO THAT.
WHOA.

01:37.328 --> 01:40.331
NANA COBB?
WE'RE MOVING HER TO A LESS
"SWINGY" RETIREMENT HOME,

01:40.331 --> 01:42.703
BUT LET'S STAY ON YOU.
TRAVIS, I KNOW THAT YOU ASKED

01:42.703 --> 01:45.306
A GIRL TO MARRY YOU,
AND SHE SAID NO,

01:45.306 --> 01:47.308
AND THAT JUST REALLY SUCKS,

01:47.308 --> 01:49.440
BUT YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY
FROM YOUR LIFE.

01:49.440 --> 01:51.442
THIS ISN'T ABOUT KIRSTEN
ANYMORE.

01:51.442 --> 01:54.445
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANNA DO,
BUT I KNOW I'M NOT GONNA FIND IT

01:54.445 --> 01:56.447
TRAPPED IN A CLASSROOM
GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS

01:56.447 --> 01:58.449
BUT NOT REALLY ALIVE
LIKE SOME SORT OF GHOST.

01:58.449 --> 02:01.452
I DON'T BELIEVE IN GHOSTS,
BECAUSE IF THEY WERE REAL,

02:01.452 --> 02:04.124
I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT I WOULD
BE FELT UP ALL THE TIME.
(laughs)

02:04.124 --> 02:07.758
I FEEL LIKE WE'RE DONE HERE,
SO... SAME TIME TOMORROW?

02:07.758 --> 02:09.530
SURE, HONEY. LOVE YOU.

02:11.562 --> 02:14.134
WHY ARE YOU IN HERE
HOLDING MY BABY?

02:14.134 --> 02:17.368
UH, BECAUSE I ASSUME
NO ONE ELSE DOES.
OH.

02:17.368 --> 02:20.371
HONEY, IS IT OKAY IF WE DRAW
SIX-PACK ABS ON STAN

02:20.371 --> 02:23.174
TO PRETEND HE'S
A ROIDED-UP BABY WRESTLER?
YOU'VE ALREADY DONE THAT, YES?

02:23.174 --> 02:24.775
MM-HMM.

02:24.775 --> 02:26.777
(deep voice)
UHH! I'VE GOT A MESSAGE

02:26.777 --> 02:28.779
TO ALL THE BABIES OUT THERE.

02:28.779 --> 02:30.781
OKAY, IF YOU STEP TO MY CRIB,

02:30.781 --> 02:32.783
YOU'RE GETTING A DIAPER
FULL OF ASS WHUPPING,

02:32.783 --> 02:35.656
'CAUSE I'M BRINGING THE PAIN.
DO YOU HEAR ME, BROTHERS?

02:35.656 --> 02:38.559
DO YOU HEAR ME?
(makes slapping sound)
OH! (grunts)

02:38.559 --> 02:41.262
I HOPE IT WAS WORTH IT,
'CAUSE NOW YOU HAVE TO

02:41.262 --> 02:43.634
TAKE HIM TO THE PARK.
CAN'T. BOBBY'S TAKING ME
SUNGLASSES SHOPPING. (pops lips)

02:43.634 --> 02:46.837
IF YOU GUYS ARE IN A BIND,
I CAN TAKE THE LITTLE BRUISER.
YOU ARE A LIFESAVER.

02:46.837 --> 02:49.640
I HAVE TO GET THAT ALLERGY SHOT
TODAY, REMEMBER?

02:49.640 --> 02:52.603
I'M GLAD I COULD HELP.
THANK YOU.

02:52.603 --> 02:55.206
(lowered voice)
YOU REALLY GETTING A SHOT?

02:55.206 --> 02:57.608
NO, BUT I'LL FIND
SOMETHING TO DO.

02:57.608 --> 02:59.950
(whispers) OKAY.

03:02.353 --> 03:05.356
SO THIS IS JUST YOUR LIFE NOW?
HANGING OUT ON A BOAT,

03:05.356 --> 03:07.718
WANDERING INTO TOWN
WITH YOUR ROBE ON

03:07.718 --> 03:10.321
TO GET A SANDWICH?

03:10.321 --> 03:12.323
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE VERY CLOSE TO TURNING

03:12.323 --> 03:14.565
INTO THAT MUSIC PRODUCER
WHO MURDERS PEOPLE.

03:14.565 --> 03:16.327
GOD, I LOVE SUBWAY.

03:16.327 --> 03:18.629
YOU CAN PILE ON ALL
THE TOPPINGS YOU WANT,

03:18.629 --> 03:21.201
PLUS THEY DO BREAKFAST NOW.
OH.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.604
AND WITH THE 12 BUCKS
I HAVE IN MY POCKET,

03:23.604 --> 03:25.976
I CAN EAT HERE FOR WHAT,
LIKE, 30 YEARS?

03:25.976 --> 03:27.978
TRAVIS, IF MY MOM HAD PAID
FOR COLLEGE,

03:27.978 --> 03:31.342
I WOULD HAVE NEVER BLOWN IT OFF.
MY MOM STOLE MY HAIR

03:31.342 --> 03:34.715
AND SOLD IT TO A DOLL COMPANY,
SO I'M STUCK IN THIS TOWN.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.247
STUCK HERE FOREVER.

03:36.247 --> 03:38.649
JUST THIS MORNING,
I SAW THIS BIG BILLBOARD,

03:38.649 --> 03:40.651
AND IT SAID
"CHEAP TICKETS TO HAWAII,"

03:40.651 --> 03:42.753
AND I THOUGHT, YEAH,
YOU KNOW? WHY NOT?

03:42.753 --> 03:45.796
WHY DON'T I JUST MAX OUT
MY CREDIT CARD AND GO TO HAWAII?

03:45.796 --> 03:48.759
WHAT? AM I MAKING
ANY SENSE TO YOU?
PERFECT SENSE.

03:48.759 --> 03:51.802
(chair clatters)

03:51.802 --> 03:53.934
ELLIE?

03:53.934 --> 03:56.607
OH, SORRY. I THOUGHT
IT WAS GRAYSON.

03:56.607 --> 03:59.239
LET ME GUESS.

03:59.239 --> 04:02.973
YOU TWO ARE GOING ON TOUR
WITH HUEY LEWIS?
I WISH.

04:02.973 --> 04:06.477
NO, BOBBY GOT US THESE SO WE CAN
DO THAT '80s MOVIE THING

04:06.477 --> 04:08.649
GUYS DO
WHEN A HOT CHICK WALKS BY.

04:08.649 --> 04:09.920
(both)DAMN!

04:09.920 --> 04:12.523
SHOULDN'T ONE OF YOU
BE BITING HIS FINGER?

04:12.523 --> 04:13.884
(gasps) UHH!

04:13.884 --> 04:16.427
I'M GONNA GO PRACTICE THAT
IN THE MIRROR.

04:16.427 --> 04:18.759
BABE, LET'S GO DO SOMETHING.
I'LL CALL--

04:18.759 --> 04:21.492
CAN'T. I PROMISED BOBBY
I'D HELP HIM PICK OUT A NEW BED.

04:21.492 --> 04:23.494
WE LIKE THE SAME FIRMNESS,
SO...

04:23.494 --> 04:26.767
IF YOU'RE LEAVING ME FOR HIM,
DON'T DRAG IT OUT. JUST DO IT.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.499
NAH.

04:28.499 --> 04:30.501
EVER SINCE HE GOT MONEY,

04:30.501 --> 04:32.973
YOU TWO ARE SPENDING
WAY TOO MUCH TIME TOGETHER.

04:32.973 --> 04:35.976
I'M JUST HELPING HIM NEST.
IT'S A GUY THING.
IT REALLY ISN'T.

04:37.808 --> 04:40.981
(whistles) EVEN TASTIER
WALKING AWAY!

04:42.753 --> 04:44.355
HERE'S YOUR LITTLE FELLA.

04:44.355 --> 04:46.417
OH, SWEETIE.

04:46.417 --> 04:47.518
TOM.
YEAH?

04:47.518 --> 04:49.790
TAKE HIM TO ANDY.
OKAY. OH.

04:49.790 --> 04:53.063
TOM'S OUR INTER-HOUSE SHUTTLE.
I PAY HIM WITH HEAD PATS.

04:53.063 --> 04:56.026
SOUNDS NORMAL. THANKS FOR
LETTING ME WATCH STAN.

04:56.026 --> 04:57.628
I LOVE KIDS.

04:57.628 --> 05:00.871
HMM. (chuckles)

05:00.871 --> 05:03.404
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
ABOUT THAT?

05:03.404 --> 05:04.535
WHAT?

05:04.535 --> 05:06.537
YOU ALWAYS SAY
YOU'RE DONE HAVING KIDS,

05:06.537 --> 05:10.881
AND HE WANTS A BABY SO BADLY,
I CAN HEAR HIS CLOCK TICKING.
GUYS DON'T HAVE CLOCKS.

05:10.881 --> 05:12.813
AH, HERE YOU GO, TOM.
HERE.

05:12.813 --> 05:16.417
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WRONG.

05:16.417 --> 05:20.391
OLD FERRET EYES IS, LIKE,
4 CENTIMETERS DILATED RIGHT NOW.

05:20.391 --> 05:22.723
HE DOES WANT KIDS EVENTUALLY,
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE

05:22.723 --> 05:24.695
HE'S OBSESSING ON CHILDREN.

05:24.695 --> 05:26.326
(high-pitched voice)
в™Є LA-LA, LA-LA в™Є

05:26.326 --> 05:27.458
в™Є LA-LA, LA-LA в™Є

05:27.458 --> 05:29.730
в™Є ELMO'S SONG в™Є

05:29.730 --> 05:31.932
OH, CRAP.

05:33.664 --> 05:35.466
(both) WHOO!

05:35.466 --> 05:36.937
WELL, THANK YOU,LADIES.

05:36.937 --> 05:39.540
NOW IT'S OUR BIT
BECAUSE WE HAVE BIGGER GLASSES,

05:39.540 --> 05:42.042
AND WE ADDED THE HAND THING.

05:42.042 --> 05:45.576
HOW'D IT GO?
TRAVIS MOVED TO HAWAII.

05:47.077 --> 05:49.950
THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD.
LET'S DO IT AGAIN.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.383
DON'T.

05:52.383 --> 05:57.357
в™Єв™Єв™Є

06:03.834 --> 06:07.468
OKAY, SO I'VE BEEN TRYING TO
CALL TRAV, BUT HE WON'T PICK UP,

06:07.468 --> 06:10.070
SO FINDING HIM
IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY.

06:10.070 --> 06:13.444
HAWAII IS NOT JUST ONE ISLAND.
IT'S AGROUPOF ISLANDS.

06:13.444 --> 06:16.547
THE LARGEST ONE IS HAWAII.

06:16.547 --> 06:18.879
TIME-OUT. SO IS HAWAII
ONE OF THE ISLANDS,

06:18.879 --> 06:22.613
OR IS IT ALL OF THE ISLANDS?
BRACE YOURSELF. BOTH.

06:22.613 --> 06:24.455
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
NO.

06:24.455 --> 06:27.588
I KNOW, BUT LUCKILY, ME AND CARL
HAVE BEEN DOING SOME RESEARCH.

06:27.588 --> 06:30.491
PROBLEM IS I LEFT MY NOTES
AT ELLIE'S.

06:30.491 --> 06:31.562
GOT IT.

06:31.562 --> 06:34.124
THANKS, TOM. HERE YOU GO.

06:34.124 --> 06:36.827
OH, TAKE THIS TO ELLIE'S,
WILL YOU?
ON IT.

06:36.827 --> 06:40.030
SO... HE JUST GOES
IN OUR HOUSE NOW?
(cell phone alert chimes)

06:40.030 --> 06:42.603
JULES, TRAVIS TEXTED ME.
HE'S ON THE NORTH SHORE.

06:42.603 --> 06:45.876
HE'S TRYING TO SCAM A JOB
AT THE TURTLE BAY RESORT.

06:45.876 --> 06:50.541
OKAY, NOW I JUST HAVE
TO GO OVER THERE AND GET HIM.
WELL, HE'S MY BOY, TOO,
SO I'M COMING WITH.

06:50.541 --> 06:53.083
IT'S MY FAULT THAT HE LEFT.
I'LL GO.

06:53.083 --> 06:55.415
WE WERE JUST TALKING
ABOUT A GROUP VACATION.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.817
SWEETIE, I-I CAN'T.

06:56.817 --> 06:59.550
I-I HAVE TOO MANY COMMITMENTS
AND RESPONSIBILITIES.

06:59.550 --> 07:01.522
(all laugh)

07:01.522 --> 07:04.424
THAT WAS GOOD, RIGHT?
(laughs) YEAH, THAT WAS GOOD.

07:04.424 --> 07:07.127
CAN'T WE JUST CALL TRAV OR SEND
HIM A STRONGLY WORDED E-MAIL?

07:07.127 --> 07:09.730
(all) DUDE.
STOP BEING
A PARADE RAINER ON-ER.

07:09.730 --> 07:12.733
WE'RE TAKING
A GROUP VACATION!

07:12.733 --> 07:14.765
(all) YAY!
WHOO-HOO!

07:14.765 --> 07:16.767
UNFORTUNATELY,
IT'S TO SAVE MY SON

07:16.767 --> 07:21.441
FROM MAKING A LIFE MISTAKE THAT
HE... MAY NEVER RECOVER FROM.

07:22.573 --> 07:23.974
(whispers) IN HAWAII!

07:23.974 --> 07:25.976
(all) YEAH!

07:25.976 --> 07:28.448
(whispers) HAWAII.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.481
(Laurie laughs)

07:30.481 --> 07:33.484
SO YOU KNOW HOW IT WAS MY JOB
TO CALL THE HOTEL

07:33.484 --> 07:36.527
AND SWITCH OUR 2-BEDROOM SUITE
TO A SINGLE

07:36.527 --> 07:39.530
SINCE MY MOM'S WATCHING STAN?
I KINDA GOT SIDETRACKED.

07:39.530 --> 07:41.962
HE DROVE ME TO GET
A TOOTHBRUSH FOR THE TRIP,

07:41.962 --> 07:44.565
BUT ALONG THE WAY,
WE SAW THE COUNTY FAIR.

07:44.565 --> 07:48.599
LONG STORY SHORT, WE MAY HAVE
WON A SQUARE DANCING CONTEST.
IDIOTS. GO ON.

07:48.599 --> 07:51.742
SO WE'RE STUCK PAYING
FOR TWO BEDROOMS, UNLESS--

07:51.742 --> 07:54.745
SELL IT, BOBBY.
I KNOW THIS GUY WHO ALSO
CAN'T GET A ROOM.

07:54.745 --> 08:00.010
NOW SINCE THERE'S AN EXTRA BED,
AND THERE'S THREE OF US...
GOOD GOD.

08:00.010 --> 08:03.814
I ALWAYS LET ANDY PACK FOR ME.

08:03.814 --> 08:06.957
HE BRINGS CRAZY SLUTTY OUTFITS,
AND THEN I GET TO SHOP.

08:06.957 --> 08:08.959
CRAFTY. UGH. I DON'T THINK

08:08.959 --> 08:11.562
I CAN SHOVE MY BODY
INTO A BIKINI RIGHT NOW.

08:11.562 --> 08:13.964
I MEAN, I HAVE A SERIOUS CASE
OF WINTER LEGS.

08:13.964 --> 08:15.566
OH, PLEASE.
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

08:15.566 --> 08:17.968
MWAH. (kisses)

08:17.968 --> 08:20.871
EW! WHAT IS WITH
THE STOMACH KISS?

08:20.871 --> 08:22.773
HE'S TRYING
TO JUMP-START MY UTERUS.

08:22.773 --> 08:24.875
BUT WITH ALL THE STUFF
GOING ON WITH TRAV,

08:24.875 --> 08:28.739
I JUST--I CAN'T DEAL
RIGHT NOW.
WHEN HE WANTS TO TALK
ABOUT BABIES,

08:28.739 --> 08:31.742
YOU JUST TALK ABOUT SOMETHING
HEDOESN'T WANNA THINK ABOUT.
MM.

08:31.742 --> 08:34.144
LIKE HOW I WANNA TRY
LIVING TOGETHER FOR SIX MONTHS,

08:34.144 --> 08:36.887
AND IF IT WORKS, WE SELL
ONE OF OUR HOUSES? HIS HOUSE.

08:36.887 --> 08:39.119
MM-HMM.
(as Sean Connery)
THAT'S THE CHICAGO WAY.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.021
HE PULLS A KNIFE.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.723
YOU PULL A GUN.

08:42.723 --> 08:44.855
(normal voice)
"THE UNTOUCHABLES."

08:44.855 --> 08:47.758
OH, IS THAT THAT MOVIE
ABOUT THE BOY IN THE BUBBLE?

08:47.758 --> 08:50.160
I CAN'T WATCH IT.
IT'S TOO SAD.
(both laugh)

08:50.160 --> 08:52.733
DID I SAY SOMETHING FUNNY?
NOT ON PURPOSE.

08:52.733 --> 08:56.867
OH, SHOOT. ALL RIGHT, HOW MUCH
TIME DO I HAVE LEFT TO PACK?
OH, THE CAR GOT HERE
TEN MINUTES AGO.

08:56.867 --> 08:58.969
WELL, HELP ME!

08:58.969 --> 09:01.011
ALL RIGHT.
JUST CRAM IT IN.

09:06.276 --> 09:08.278
WOW, LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

09:08.278 --> 09:09.780
ALOHA.

09:09.780 --> 09:12.182
(gasps) THEY REALLY SAY THAT.
THAT'S A REAL THING!

09:12.182 --> 09:14.685
OKAY.
I KNOW WE'RE ALL EXCITED.

09:14.685 --> 09:16.687
LAURIE MADE THAT CLEAR
ON THE PLANE

09:16.687 --> 09:18.989
WHEN SHE STRIPPED DOWN
TO HER BRA BECAUSE SHE SAID

09:18.989 --> 09:21.962
IT LOOKED LIKE A BIKINI TOP,
WHICH IT DOESN'T.

09:21.962 --> 09:24.735
CAN WE ALL TRY NOT TO ACT
LIKE IDIOTS?

09:24.735 --> 09:28.568
(chuckles) LOOK WHAT WE GOT
AT THE GIFT SHOP.

09:31.241 --> 09:32.603
WHOO.
OW!

09:32.603 --> 09:34.004
(deep voice)HELLO.

09:34.004 --> 09:37.347
CAN YOU BELIEVE THEM?
JUL-JULES?

09:37.347 --> 09:40.811
WATERSLIDE IN A SUNDRESS!

09:40.811 --> 09:42.112
WHOO!

09:42.112 --> 09:44.655
IT TOTALLY DOES.
IT DOESN'T.

09:44.655 --> 09:48.088
в™Є OH, WE'RE GOIN'
TO A HUKILAU в™Є

09:48.088 --> 09:51.361
в™Є TO A HUKI-HUKI-HUKI-HUKI,
HUKILAU в™Є

09:51.361 --> 09:53.864
в™Є EVERYBODY в™Є

09:53.864 --> 09:57.027
IT'S IMPRESSIVE.

09:57.027 --> 09:58.799
AND A PRETTY VIEW.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.801
HA. I WONDER HOW LONG

10:00.801 --> 10:04.204
IT WILL BE UNTIL SOME FAT GUY
IN A BANANA HAMMOCK RUINS IT.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.937
OH. FIVE SECONDS.

10:06.937 --> 10:09.680
ANDY, YOU...

10:09.680 --> 10:12.743
I WONDER IF BOBBY'S SCARED
BEING ALL BY HIMSELF.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.323
I DIDN'T HAVE A JOB
FOR YOUR SON,

10:23.323 --> 10:25.325
BUT I POINTED HIM
TO THIS ADDRESS.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.327
IT'S A SHACK OUTSIDE TOWN
WHERE BROKE TRAVELERS

10:27.327 --> 10:29.830
CAN GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP.
OKAY, MY BABY'S IN A SHACK.

10:29.830 --> 10:32.903
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP, BLAKE.
MY PLEASURE, MS. COBB.

10:36.036 --> 10:38.168
ALL RIGHT, LET IT OUT.

10:38.168 --> 10:39.770
(moaning) BLAKE.

10:39.770 --> 10:41.912
SO PRESSED
AND PUT TOGETHER.

10:41.912 --> 10:44.915
PLUS WITH THAT BLACK EYE,
YOU KNOW HE'S FUN.

10:44.915 --> 10:48.348
MM. (singsongy)
HE CAN MANAGEMYHOTEL ANYTIME!

10:48.348 --> 10:50.350
MINE,TOO.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.352
OH, MY GOSH, YOU GUYS!

10:52.352 --> 10:56.356
LOOK AT THE LITTLE BABY
IN THE HULA SKIRT.

10:56.356 --> 10:59.359
IT IS AMAZING THAT
YOU CAN HAVE ONE OF THOSE

10:59.359 --> 11:01.732
JUST SLIDE OUT OF YOUR BODY.

11:01.732 --> 11:04.434
SLIDE, MY ASS. TRAVIS CAME OUT
DOING THE SPLITS.

11:04.434 --> 11:07.067
YOU EVER THINK
ABOUT DOING THAT AGAIN?

11:07.067 --> 11:09.439
I'M JUST TALKIN',
DRINKIN' A BLUE DRINK.

11:09.439 --> 11:12.272
YEAH, I THINK ABOUT THAT STUFF
ALL THE TIME.

11:12.272 --> 11:13.774
MM?
LIKE BEING HERE, YOU KNOW?

11:13.774 --> 11:16.907
IF WE CAN GET ALONG SO GOOD
IN SUCH A TINY HOTEL ROOM,

11:16.907 --> 11:19.910
IMAGINE HOW COMFORTABLE
IT WOULD BE TO LIVE TOGETHER

11:19.910 --> 11:21.912
IN A BIG HOUSE.

11:21.912 --> 11:23.914
I-I SHOULD GO PAY THE TAB.

11:26.056 --> 11:29.689
(as Sean Connery)
THE CHICAGO WAY.

11:31.091 --> 11:33.263
(tires screech)
GOT THE RENTAL.

11:33.263 --> 11:35.796
SHOCKER. IT'S PERFECT.

11:35.796 --> 11:38.799
TRAVIS HAS NO JOB, NO FRIENDS,
AND HE LIVES IN A SHACK.

11:38.799 --> 11:41.401
HE'S GONNA BE DYING
TO COME HOME.

11:43.073 --> 11:44.474
(tires screech)

11:44.474 --> 11:46.336
NO WAY!

11:46.336 --> 11:48.478
ALOHA, GUYS!

11:48.478 --> 11:50.881
I TAUGHT EVERYONE PENNY CAN

11:50.881 --> 11:54.344
EXCEPT HERE WE USE A COCONUT
AND A ROCK.

11:54.344 --> 11:57.848
(all, high-pitched voices)
COCO-ROCK!

12:08.458 --> 12:10.060
MOM, I'M SORRY.

12:10.060 --> 12:12.462
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
WHAT I WAS DOING.

12:12.462 --> 12:13.804
YOU THINK?

12:13.804 --> 12:15.806
I JUST GOT INSPIRED
AND WENT WITH IT.

12:15.806 --> 12:18.108
IT'S LIKE LAST THANKSGIVING
WHEN I GOT THE IDEA

12:18.108 --> 12:20.110
TO MAKE THE PUMPKIN BREAD,
ONLY WAY BIGGER.

12:20.110 --> 12:21.511
I'VE BEEN HAVING NIGHTMARES

12:21.511 --> 12:23.473
THAT YOU JOINED A PACK
OF HAWAIIAN HOBOS.

12:23.473 --> 12:26.977
YOU'RE FIGHTING NO-LEGGED DOGS
FOR FISH SCRAPS.
(scoffs)

12:26.977 --> 12:28.949
I HAD A NO-LEGGED DOG ONCE.

12:28.949 --> 12:33.824
HE COULDN'T STOP ROLLING OVER
AND OVER AND OVER. (laughs)

12:33.824 --> 12:36.526
I KNOW IT'S NO TIME FOR JOKES,
BUT THAT WAS GOLD, BABY.

12:36.526 --> 12:39.830
HEY, WHAT'S UP?
OH! THIS IS MY BOY.

12:39.830 --> 12:44.394
HI. I'M TED BUCKLAND, BUT, UH,
PEOPLE CALL ME "THE BUCK."

12:44.394 --> 12:46.136
I'M BETTING THEY DON'T.

12:46.136 --> 12:47.838
I'D LIKE THEM TO.

12:47.838 --> 12:52.172
TED IS MAD FAMOUS. HE CAN TAKE
ANY SONG AND MAKE IT SAD.

12:52.172 --> 12:54.274
(slaps guitar)

12:54.274 --> 12:56.847
THAT'S A USEFUL SKILL,
AND I WANNA SEE IT.

12:56.847 --> 12:59.850
BUT, TRAVIS,
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
"LOVE SHACK"!

12:59.850 --> 13:02.913
(strumming minor chords)
в™Є THE LOVE SHACK
IS A LITTLE OL' PLACE в™Є

13:02.913 --> 13:07.057
в™Є WHERE
WE CAN GET TOGETHER в™Є

13:07.057 --> 13:11.161
в™Є LOVE SHACK, BABY в™Є

13:11.161 --> 13:13.824
в™Є OH, LOVE SHACK в™Є

13:13.824 --> 13:15.365
в™Є BABY, LOVE SHACK в™Є

13:15.365 --> 13:17.928
в™Є I SAID LOVE SHACK в™Є

13:17.928 --> 13:20.370
в™Є BABY, LOVE SHACK, OH в™Є

13:20.370 --> 13:23.073
WOW. I WANNA KILL MYSELF.

13:23.073 --> 13:26.106
THANK YOU.
MOM, I KNOW YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT ME,

13:26.106 --> 13:28.038
AND I WANNA SHOW YOU
THAT I'M OKAY,

13:28.038 --> 13:30.040
BUT IT'S GONNA HAVE TO WAIT
UNTIL TOMORROW,

13:30.040 --> 13:32.382
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO THIS PARTY,
AND I'D INVITE YOU,

13:32.382 --> 13:33.984
BUT, UH...
LOCALS ONLY, BRAH.

13:33.984 --> 13:36.386
YOU'VE BEEN HERE
THREE DAYS!
RIGHT?

13:36.386 --> 13:39.119
в™Є CLANG, CLANG, CLANG
WENT THE TROLLEY в™Є

13:39.119 --> 13:42.092
в™Є DING, DING, DING
WENT THE BELL в™Є

13:42.092 --> 13:44.925
в™Є ZING, ZING, ZING
WENT MY HEART STRINGS в™Є

13:44.925 --> 13:47.327
в™Є FROM THE MOMENT I SAW YOU,
I FELL в™Є

13:47.327 --> 13:49.229
COME ON, EVERYBODY!

13:49.229 --> 13:52.202
HE LIVES IN A SHACK.
HE SITS ON THE BEACH ALL DAY

13:52.202 --> 13:55.205
AND PARTIES ALL NIGHT.
WHAT KIND OF LIFE IS THAT?

13:55.205 --> 13:57.067
AN AWESOME ONE.
BEST LIFE EVER.

13:57.067 --> 13:59.910
FIRST TIME I'VE EVER BEEN
JEALOUS OF HIM.
GOOD FRIENDS WOULD LIE.

13:59.910 --> 14:01.411
OH, YEAH.

14:01.411 --> 14:03.413
BIG KIMO WILL MAKE ME
FEEL BETTER.

14:03.413 --> 14:06.016
HE LIKES TO PUT RUM
IN HIS BREAKFAST SMOOTHIE.

14:06.016 --> 14:08.118
(Laurie laughs)

14:08.118 --> 14:10.921
IS THAT THE CANDLE HOLDER
FROM YOUR ROOM?

14:10.921 --> 14:12.983
MM, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

14:12.983 --> 14:14.384
(mouths word)

14:14.384 --> 14:16.987
SINCE THE, UH, HOTEL SHOPS
ARE CLOSED,

14:16.987 --> 14:19.389
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WOULD LIKE TO SEE

14:19.389 --> 14:23.493
WHAT MY HUSBAND THINKS
IS APPROPRIATE RESORT WEAR. OH.

14:23.493 --> 14:26.436
IT'S FOR THE LADY WHO LIKES
TO LOUNGE BY THE POOL

14:26.436 --> 14:28.969
BUT ALSO GET PAID FOR SEX.

14:28.969 --> 14:31.141
YOU CAN DO THAT?
IS THAT A JOB?

14:31.141 --> 14:33.473
IT'S RIDICULOUS.
I'M NOT STUPID.

14:34.975 --> 14:36.146
HEY.

14:36.146 --> 14:38.548
HEY. YOU KNOW, I KNOW
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT TRAV,

14:38.548 --> 14:41.982
BUT IT'S NOT ALL BAD.
YOU HAVE GREAT ISLAND HAIR.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.354
YOU KNOW, WHEN THE WIND
HITS IT JUST RIGHT,

14:44.354 --> 14:47.217
I LOOK LIKE
I'M IN A DURAN DURAN VIDEO.
(chuckles)

14:47.217 --> 14:49.619
LISTEN, I'M SORRY
I BAILED ON YOU YESTERDAY

14:49.619 --> 14:51.962
WHEN YOU BROUGHT UP
MOVING IN.
SO RUDE.

14:51.962 --> 14:53.964
ESPECIALLY SINCE
I'VE BEEN PESTERING YOU

14:53.964 --> 14:56.896
ABOUT WHETHER YOU WANT
ANOTHER KID. YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:56.896 --> 14:58.898
WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT IT ALL
TONIGHT.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.401
YEAH, AFTER YOUR DAY
WITH TRAV.
(lowered voice)
THE CHICAGO WAY?

15:01.401 --> 15:02.902
WHAT?
(normal voice) WHAT?

15:02.902 --> 15:05.375
WHAT'D YOU SAY?
NOTHING. NO, I THINK
THAT'S GREAT.

15:05.375 --> 15:06.376
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY.

15:08.108 --> 15:11.211
BRACE YOURSELF, BIG KIMO.
I'M COMING IN.

15:13.543 --> 15:17.948
ANDY, COME HELP ME TAKE
THE TAGS OFF MY NEW CLOTHES

15:17.948 --> 15:20.350
SO YOU CAN SEE
HOW MUCH MONEY YOU SPENT.

15:20.350 --> 15:23.093
DID YOU KNOW THAT HOTELS
CHARGE 30 BUCKS FOR SOCKS?

15:23.093 --> 15:25.495
BOBBY AND I SPENT
THE LAST TWO HOURS

15:25.495 --> 15:27.227
INVENTING A KNOCK LANGUAGE.

15:27.227 --> 15:30.100
(rhythmic knocking on door)

15:30.100 --> 15:31.931
(laughs)

15:31.931 --> 15:33.233
THAT GUY.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.965
THAT GUY. YOU REALIZE

15:34.965 --> 15:37.937
YOU CAN JUST WALK OUT THERE
AND JUST SEE HIM?
IT'S NOT THE SAME.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.640
(Bobby) YEAH,
WE WANNA BE INSIDE FRIENDS.

15:40.640 --> 15:43.243
IF YOU COME IN HERE
AND INVADE MY SPACE,

15:43.243 --> 15:46.946
I'M GONNA CHOP YOU UP
AND FEED YOU TO...

15:46.946 --> 15:48.448
HMM, HMM.

15:48.448 --> 15:51.681
(haltingly)
KA WAHINE 'AI HONUA.

15:51.681 --> 15:53.283
SHE'S THE VOLCANO GODDESS.

15:53.283 --> 15:55.555
I BOUGHT A $200 BOOK
ON HAWAIIAN CULTURE

15:55.555 --> 15:57.157
AT THE GIFT SHOP.

15:57.157 --> 16:00.030
I GOT IT.
YOU MAY ENTER.

16:07.367 --> 16:10.000
I LOVE YOU, TOO, MAN.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.671
IT'S A COCONUT TREE.

16:11.671 --> 16:14.974
OH, ONE HANGING COCONUT.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.276
HUH.

16:16.276 --> 16:17.647
SHAKE IT.

16:17.647 --> 16:19.249
OH, SHAKE IT HARDER.

16:19.249 --> 16:23.453
OH, OH. OW! MY HEAD.
(grunts) I'M DEAD.

16:23.453 --> 16:26.286
HAWAIIAN SUICIDE.

16:26.286 --> 16:29.989
THIS IS
MY FAVORITE BEACH.

16:29.989 --> 16:33.423
I COME HERE EVERY MORNING AFTER
I STOP AT THAT KONA COFFEE HUT.

16:33.423 --> 16:36.166
THEBESTCUP OF JOE EVER.
AM I RIGHT?

16:36.166 --> 16:38.228
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

16:38.228 --> 16:40.300
MMM!

16:40.300 --> 16:42.402
I HOPE I NEVER
PEE THIS OUT.

16:42.402 --> 16:43.673
(chuckles)

16:43.673 --> 16:45.675
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT IS BEAUTIFUL.

16:45.675 --> 16:47.677
HIKING UP TO THAT WATERFALL
THIS MORNING,

16:47.677 --> 16:50.680
I STARTED TO BELIEVE IN GOD
EVEN MORE THAN THE TIME

16:50.680 --> 16:53.283
THAT I PRAYED OUT
UNCLE NORM'S FOOT CANCER.

16:53.283 --> 16:54.784
STILL LOST HIS FOOT.

16:54.784 --> 16:58.048
YEAH, HE'S ALIVE.

16:58.048 --> 17:00.490
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
FOR MONEY?

17:00.490 --> 17:02.492
I ALREADY HAVE A JOB.

17:02.492 --> 17:05.495
WHEN ELDERLY TOURISTS GET SICK,
I SELL 'EM FAKE PRESCRIPTIONS.
NO!

17:05.495 --> 17:08.658
KIDDING. LOOK, I'LL SHOW YOU
WHERE I WORK, OKAY?

17:08.658 --> 17:12.662
BUT FOR NOW,
CAN WE JUST ENJOY THE VIEW?

17:12.662 --> 17:14.334
FINE.

17:16.206 --> 17:20.140
OH, MY GOD!
I WANNA SNORT THIS.

17:23.413 --> 17:27.046
COMPLIMENTS OF THE MANAGER.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.319
THANKS.
YOU'RE A PRINCE, V.B.

17:29.319 --> 17:31.581
(man) OUR RESORT IS LOCATED ON
THE NORTH SHORE OF O'AHU...
V.B.?

17:31.581 --> 17:36.326
VACATION BOYFRIEND.
MARK MY WORDS, I'M TAGGING THAT.
I HEAR A CLASSY GIRL.

17:36.326 --> 17:38.728
WE'RE WATCHING THE LOOP
ON THE HOTEL CHANNEL.

17:38.728 --> 17:40.790
(all) WITH SEVEN RESTAURANTS
TO CHOOSE FROM,

17:40.790 --> 17:45.195
DINING AT THIS GREAT RESORT
IS A FEAST FOR THE SENSES.

17:45.195 --> 17:50.370
BOBBY, REMEMBER THAT FUN TALK
WE HAD ABOUT INVADING MY SPACE?

17:50.370 --> 17:52.372
'CAUSE BACK HOME, I RECALL

17:52.372 --> 17:54.374
YOU GOING TO GET
A NEW TOOTHBRUSH,

17:54.374 --> 17:57.347
BUT THEN YOU GOT...
SIDETRACKED.

17:57.347 --> 18:00.510
NOW MY TOOTHBRUSH IS WET.

18:00.510 --> 18:03.082
GO. GO, GO, GO.
GO, GO, GO, GO, GO, GO!
STAY DOWN. GO, GO.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.454
DID YOU USE IT?
NO.

18:04.454 --> 18:06.186
THEN WHY IS IT WET?
IT'S HUMID HERE.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.757
WHY ISN'T YOURS WET?
I BLOW-DRIED IT.

18:07.757 --> 18:10.320
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
IF IT'S WET, IT FEELS
LIKE SOMEONE ELSE USED IT,

18:10.320 --> 18:12.262
AND IT GROSSES ME OUT.
SHOW ME YOUR TOOTHBRUSH.

18:12.262 --> 18:13.263
CAN'T.
WHY?

18:13.263 --> 18:15.465
IT'S ON THE BEACH.
"WHY?" AGAIN.

18:15.465 --> 18:19.229
WELL, WHO WOULDN'T WANNA BRUSH
THEIR TEETH BY THE OCEAN?
IT'S THE HAWAIIAN WAY.

18:19.229 --> 18:21.231
IS IT?

18:26.306 --> 18:29.639
THIS IS YOUR JOB?
YOU WAX SURFBOARDS?

18:29.639 --> 18:30.780
YEAH, BRAH.

18:30.780 --> 18:33.112
YOU DON'T EVEN SURF.

18:33.112 --> 18:38.148
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY.
THOSE THAT CAN'T DO, WAX.

18:38.148 --> 18:40.420
CALM DOWN, BUCK.

18:40.420 --> 18:43.293
OH, YEAH!
BUCK'S IN THE HOUSE!

18:43.293 --> 18:44.694
I GOTS TO SAY,

18:44.694 --> 18:47.657
I LIKE WORKING WITH MY HANDS.

18:47.657 --> 18:51.801
PLEASE. YOU USED TO PUT ON
GLOVES TO PLAY IN YOUR SANDBOX.

18:51.801 --> 18:53.433
WILL YOU ADMIT IT?

18:53.433 --> 18:57.267
LIFE HERE IS PRETTY SICK.

18:57.267 --> 18:58.708
SO SICK, DUDE.

18:58.708 --> 19:00.770
OKAY, LET'S STOP
KIDDING AROUND.

19:00.770 --> 19:02.772
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

19:02.772 --> 19:04.774
(sighs)

19:04.774 --> 19:07.777
(humming
a-ha's "Take On Me")

19:13.383 --> 19:16.656
в™Єв™Єв™Є

19:16.656 --> 19:19.189
SEE? I TOLD YOU SO.

19:19.189 --> 19:21.391
YOU DIDN'T JUST PUT
THIS HERE?

19:21.391 --> 19:24.364
'CAUSE IT LOOKS NEW, AND IT SAYS
"TURTLE BAY RESORT" ON IT.

19:24.364 --> 19:26.196
MUST BE A CHAIN.
REALLY? A CHAIN?

19:26.196 --> 19:27.897
(both) YEAH.
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU WERE AT THE HOTEL?

19:27.897 --> 19:29.269
