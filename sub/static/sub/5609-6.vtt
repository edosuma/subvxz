EMMA: An‘hur knows we freed Merlin
and he's really not happy about it.

00:05.923 --> 00:07.709
I've been waiting for you, Emma.

00:07.758 --> 00:09.749
GUINEVERE: Take this traitor to the dungeon,
Where he belongs.

00:09.843 --> 00:11.003
REGINA: "The Crimson Crown."

00:11.094 --> 00:13.346
It's used to communicate
through magical barriers.

00:13.430 --> 00:15.261
We must've been trying
to communicate with Merlin.

00:15.390 --> 00:16.891
Can you free Emma from the darkness?

00:16.934 --> 00:17.923
Sure.

00:18.268 --> 00:20.759
How long do you think you can
hold my heart and threaten me?

00:20.812 --> 00:22.939
As long as it takes
for me to get what I want.

00:22.981 --> 00:25.597
The only one
who can get me that sword is you.

00:25.651 --> 00:27.312
I can't be the hero you want.

00:27.444 --> 00:28.433
What are you doing?

00:28.570 --> 00:30.231
Reminding you
what you have to fight for.

00:55.389 --> 00:58.426
Not bad for a bloke who spent
the last 1,000 years in a tree.

00:58.475 --> 01:00.340
-Just like riding a bike.
-(WHOOSH|NG)

01:01.895 --> 01:04.307
Won't be long before
Arthur knows we're here.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.309
How do you know what a bike is?

01:06.441 --> 01:09.308
Do you really think all my prophecies
came true because of luck?

01:09.403 --> 01:10.392
This way.

01:17.452 --> 01:19.067
(MEN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

01:21.623 --> 01:22.999

01:25.669 --> 01:27.580
Bits and pieces. Yeah.

01:41.310 --> 01:42.345
LANCELOT: Charming?

01:42.436 --> 01:45.348
It's okay. Mary Margaret and l
are no longer under Arthur's control.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.981
How did you break his thrall over you?

01:47.024 --> 01:48.980
They didn't, mate.

01:49.026 --> 01:50.436
Idid.

01:51.194 --> 01:52.183
Merlin.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.520
MERIDA: What about me, now?

01:54.614 --> 01:55.694
You here to free me, too?

01:55.782 --> 01:58.034
-Merida?
-How did you end up in there?

01:58.160 --> 02:00.651
Long story.
But after what your daughter did to me,

02:00.704 --> 02:02.695
-letting me out is the least you can do.
-K|LL|AN: Aye.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.283
She's right.

02:04.374 --> 02:05.705
Emma would want us to free her.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.953
Indeed. But much has changed
in the past millennia.

02:08.045 --> 02:10.457
These bars are enchanted with magic

02:10.547 --> 02:12.208
that I've never encountered before.

02:12.341 --> 02:13.456
Here.

02:14.217 --> 02:15.423
Try this.

02:15.552 --> 02:16.541
Ah!

02:16.637 --> 02:18.798
Well, aren't you the clever one?

02:19.097 --> 02:20.758
Glad someone noticed.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.467
(WHOOSHING)

02:32.402 --> 02:33.391
(MEN SHOUTING IN DISTANCE)

02:33.904 --> 02:35.394

02:35.530 --> 02:36.565
MERIDA: No, wait.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.484
Wait, I can't leave.
Arthur took my Wisps.

02:39.076 --> 02:40.782
They're the only way
I can find my brothers.

02:40.869 --> 02:43.030
Right now those Wisps
will only lead you to one thing,

02:43.080 --> 02:44.195
your death.

02:45.082 --> 02:47.994
I assure you, we will find another way
to rescue your brothers.

03:00.222 --> 03:02.588
We found Merlin back in Camelot?

03:02.682 --> 03:05.298
Emma let it slip last night
when she tried to visit Henry.

03:05.394 --> 03:07.009
KILLIAN: If we found that sorcerer,

03:07.104 --> 03:09.720
why the bloody hell didn't he destroy
the darkness in Emma?

03:09.815 --> 03:10.930
You're asking the wrong person.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.400
Well, we can't very well ask him.

03:12.484 --> 03:14.190
That's exactly what we're going to do.

03:14.277 --> 03:15.528
The Crimson Crown?

03:15.946 --> 03:18.437
You figured out how to make
the communication spell work.

03:18.490 --> 03:22.449
Let's just say seeing Emma rip
Violet's heart from her chest

03:22.536 --> 03:24.197
gave me all the motivation I need.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.953
How does this thing work?
Do we simply speak to it?

03:27.082 --> 03:28.663
It's not that easy.

03:28.750 --> 03:31.162
Notjust anyone can summon Merlin.

03:31.253 --> 03:33.995
He'll only appear to someone
who's been chosen by him.

03:34.089 --> 03:37.297
Arthur. Merlin delivered
all the prophecies to him.

03:38.135 --> 03:39.341
So what do you say, Sheriff?

03:39.428 --> 03:40.838
Already on my way.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.294
Wait. Wait.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.050
Why are we wasting
our time with Merlin

03:44.141 --> 03:45.802
when there's someone here
who can help us?

03:46.101 --> 03:47.090
Who?

03:47.144 --> 03:48.304
Rumple.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.477
If he hadn't brought the darkness
back to Storybrooke,

03:50.564 --> 03:52.270
we wouldn't even be
standing here right now.

03:52.357 --> 03:55.394
Rumple may be to blame
for the situation we're in.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.316
But so is Emma.

03:57.612 --> 04:01.150
She was seduced by the darkness
just like he was.

04:01.199 --> 04:02.484
So how does that make
Rumple any different?

04:02.576 --> 04:04.988
Sorry, love. Crocodile
had more chances than anyone.

04:05.036 --> 04:07.118
And right now we need
to give Emma her best chance,

04:07.205 --> 04:09.116
which means contacting Merlin.

04:09.207 --> 04:11.038
And if something bad
happens to Rumple?

04:11.126 --> 04:13.492
It's a risk we'll have to take.

04:13.545 --> 04:16.252
Mmm. Well, maybe you're willing to.
I'm not.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.111
Forgive me, Belle.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.940
MERIDA: Saw you back there.
You're not half bad with magic.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.184
If I was half as good as you,

05:17.234 --> 05:19.941
I would never have ended up
in that dungeon in the first place.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.235
Well, why were you down there?

05:22.614 --> 05:24.946
After I parted ways with the lot of you,

05:25.408 --> 05:26.568
I followed the will-o'-the-wisp

05:26.618 --> 05:28.324
to find where the Clans
are keeping my brothers.

05:29.246 --> 05:31.578
The Wisps led me to the Ivory Sea,

05:31.915 --> 05:34.577
so I stole a boat to make the crossing.

05:34.626 --> 05:37.493
But, unfortunately,
the boat belonged to the wrong fellow.

05:37.587 --> 05:38.576
What, Arthur?

05:38.713 --> 05:41.500
His men captured me
and threw me in that dank prison.

05:45.262 --> 05:46.251
Shh.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.262
Did you hear that?

05:49.850 --> 05:50.839
Huh?

05:52.352 --> 05:53.592
Hear what?

05:53.687 --> 05:54.927
Nothing.

05:56.064 --> 05:59.397
I just needed your friends
to get out of sight.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.190
What?

06:01.278 --> 06:02.313
VVhy?

06:03.154 --> 06:05.065
So they don't see this.

06:05.282 --> 06:06.271
(GROANS)

06:11.997 --> 06:14.238
I've pushed him as hard as I can.

06:14.291 --> 06:16.532
He's at the end of his tether.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.009
You were saying?

06:28.221 --> 06:29.631
(HEART BEATING)

06:30.348 --> 06:32.213
Oh. Go ahead. Crush it.

06:32.309 --> 06:34.550
Better that than helping you
with your dirty work.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.969
Why would I do that
when yourjob isn't finished yet?

06:37.063 --> 06:38.052
What are you on about?

06:38.148 --> 06:39.638
How am I supposed to train him
when he's not even here?

06:39.733 --> 06:40.813
You confirmed the one thing
I needed to know,

06:40.901 --> 06:43.233
Belle's still someone
he's willing to fight for.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.231
It didn't exactly make him a hero,
now, did it?

06:45.322 --> 06:46.562
It Will,

06:47.407 --> 06:49.193
if he wants to stop you.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.324
Stop me? From what?

06:51.369 --> 06:53.030
Killing Belle.

06:54.998 --> 06:57.705
Now, go find her
and put an arrow through her heart.

Ooh. You got fire. I like that.
But I don't mean to hurt you.

07:29.366 --> 07:30.651
Tell that to the bump on my head.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.861
Without the Wisps,
I need another way to find my brothers.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.033
And that other way

07:35.163 --> 07:36.369
is you.

07:36.498 --> 07:39.956
Oh, yeah. If you needed magic,
you could have just asked.

07:40.085 --> 07:41.325
What, and risked getting a "no?"

07:42.128 --> 07:46.838
Sorry, but I'm more of a
hit-first-ask-questions-Iater kind of lass.

07:46.883 --> 07:48.714
Is that why the Clans
kidnapped your brothers?

07:48.802 --> 07:51.794
Hardly. Those kilted oafs
don't think I can rule the Highlands

07:51.888 --> 07:53.628
without marrying one of them.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.224
I'm not going to marry
someone I don't fancy

07:55.266 --> 07:56.767
just to hold onto my own crown.

07:58.603 --> 08:01.219
After my father's death,
they exiled my mother

08:01.272 --> 08:03.888
then kidnapped my brothers
as ransom.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.942
They'll only free them
if I relinquish the throne.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.643
And you don't plan on doing that.

08:08.738 --> 08:12.151
Would you give up everything you've
ever dreamed ofjust because a man

08:12.242 --> 08:13.823
said you didn't deserve it?

08:14.744 --> 08:15.824
So what do you say?

08:16.913 --> 08:20.531
Will you help me show the Clans
they messed with the wrong queen?

I meant, when I was in the coma,

all I wanted to do was let go.

After all I've done,
why did I deserve to live?

After all the things I'd done to you,

If she wanted to find me,
she would have already.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.206
She wanted me to escape.

10:31.256 --> 10:33.998
That doesn't make sense.
She kidnapped you.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.961
To turn me into a hero.

10:36.845 --> 10:39.632
So I could pull Excalibur from the stone.

10:40.431 --> 10:43.343
So how does letting you escape do that?

We can use it to find my brothers.

-No.

but to take it from her.

will be executed.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.136
That's it.

13:02.865 --> 13:04.901
There's only one way
to save my brothers now.

13:04.993 --> 13:06.073
I need to change their fate.

13:06.744 --> 13:08.609
And I need you to do it for me.

13:20.008 --> 13:22.294
Was that a kick, my little munchkin?

13:24.053 --> 13:25.042
(LOCK DISENGAGES)

13:26.431 --> 13:27.841
Oh, thank God.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.426
I'm absolutely famished.

13:29.517 --> 13:31.382
And the only thing this little one
seems to want at the moment

13:31.477 --> 13:32.728
is a plate of onion rings.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.562
I'm under strict orders from the Mayor
to only feed you local,

13:36.691 --> 13:38.147
organically-grown produce.

13:38.234 --> 13:40.771
Well, isn't my sister sweet?
Go.

13:40.862 --> 13:41.851
(SCOFFS)

13:46.576 --> 13:47.565
(SIGHS)

13:48.077 --> 13:51.535
Trust me, if anyone knows what it's like
to be pregnant behind bars, it's me.

13:51.581 --> 13:53.367
The Dark Swan.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.702
To what do I owe this honor?

13:55.793 --> 13:57.499
I just wanted to have a little chat.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.244
Afraid I'm not in the mood.

14:12.393 --> 14:14.725
But I suppose
I could be willing to listen.

14:16.189 --> 14:17.304
So tell me,

14:18.066 --> 14:20.978
what kind of trouble
do you want to get into?

14:26.449 --> 14:27.655
DARK SWAN: Eat up.

14:28.409 --> 14:30.070
Dark Ones don'tjudge.

14:30.995 --> 14:31.984
(CHUCKLES)

14:32.789 --> 14:36.623
Despite these greasy treats,
I know this isn't a social call.

14:36.793 --> 14:37.953
What do you want?

14:38.002 --> 14:40.744
Direct. I like that.
Take a look at this.

14:43.466 --> 14:45.081
The Apprentice's Wand.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.341
You're the only one around
who's wielded Merlin's magic

14:47.428 --> 14:49.089
and lived to tell about it.

14:49.305 --> 14:51.887
Aw. It's nice to be appreciated.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.641
If all goes according to plan,
I'll need your help.

14:55.686 --> 14:59.474
(GASPS) How exciting! I can't wait to hear
what you're offering in return.

14:59.941 --> 15:01.397
Your freedom,

15:02.110 --> 15:04.817
and my protection against Regina
and anyone else who wants to hurt you.

15:04.862 --> 15:06.477
So the Dark One's here to make a deal.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.189
How dreadfully unoriginal.

15:09.283 --> 15:13.492
You see, believe it or not,
that patient with the mop loves to talk.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.831
And I hear that you've been very naughty.

15:16.290 --> 15:19.373
Tearing out that little girl's heart
to break your son's?

15:19.460 --> 15:23.920
(LAUGHS) Kudos. That is next level darkness.
Well done.

15:24.674 --> 15:27.131
You think you're allowed to judge
after everything you've done?

15:27.510 --> 15:28.625
No.

15:28.678 --> 15:31.215
But as someone that's been on
the receiving end of a mother's betrayal,

15:31.305 --> 15:33.216
I know that those feelings of hurt
don't go away.

15:33.891 --> 15:34.971
They fester.

15:35.017 --> 15:37.349
So have fun with a lifetime of resentment.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.052
He'll forgive me. He just needs time.

15:39.147 --> 15:42.731
Even with all the time in the world,
some things can't be forgiven.

15:43.526 --> 15:45.141
I don't believe that.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.193
I killed Neal.

15:48.614 --> 15:50.024
Ready to kiss and make up?

15:50.116 --> 15:51.856
Do we have a deal or not?

15:51.909 --> 15:55.197
(SIGHS) I've got my own family problems.
I don't need yours.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.404
I'm trying to turn over a new leaf.

15:57.498 --> 15:58.874
And with the little one on the way,

15:58.958 --> 16:02.746
I wouldn't want to involve myself with
someone that might be a bad influence.

16:02.837 --> 16:04.202
But thanks for the nosh.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.879
If that's all, I'd like to go back to my cell.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.957
You will need an ally in this town.

16:09.051 --> 16:11.007
Maybe not now, but soon.

16:11.637 --> 16:12.922
You'll be back to take my deal.

16:14.056 --> 16:15.637
I don't think so, Emma.

16:16.309 --> 16:20.143
You see, the difference
between you and me is

16:20.229 --> 16:22.561
I don't mind being alone.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.407
All right. The coast is clear.

16:35.286 --> 16:36.401
We should go now.

16:36.454 --> 16:39.491
No, no, no.
I'm sorry. I can't go. I'm sorry.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.031
Your shop's only 100 yards away.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.121
(SIGHS) I'm sorry.

16:44.837 --> 16:45.952
I can't.

16:46.047 --> 16:49.414
You made it out of the woods
and through the mines...

16:50.718 --> 16:53.380
This isn'tjust about you
getting back to your shop, is it?

16:57.433 --> 16:59.139
It's my leg.

17:03.189 --> 17:05.771
It's a reminder of what I was,

17:05.858 --> 17:07.894
when I fled the Ogre Wars.

17:09.278 --> 17:11.360
What I continued to be
when I became the Dark One,

17:11.447 --> 17:13.483
and what I still am, is a coward.

17:13.991 --> 17:16.733
You've told me why
you have that limp before.

17:16.786 --> 17:19.072
Because you walked for days
on a broken foot

17:19.121 --> 17:20.907
just so you could return to your son.

17:20.957 --> 17:24.245
But do you know how the foot
was broken in the first place?

17:24.418 --> 17:26.204
Because you broke it.

17:26.504 --> 17:29.120
So that Baelfire wouldn't grow up
without a father.

17:29.215 --> 17:33.299
Rumple, you may have made
many mistakes in your life,

17:33.386 --> 17:35.547
but this isn't one of them.

17:40.226 --> 17:44.139
I have always seen the man
behind the beast, all right?

17:44.814 --> 17:46.020
But now...

17:46.107 --> 17:48.723
Now, I see something else, too.

17:48.818 --> 17:49.978
A hero.

17:51.445 --> 17:55.108
And you, you just need
to learn to see him, too.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.156
Uh...

18:10.506 --> 18:11.495
(CRACKS)

18:13.718 --> 18:16.380
Uh... Where did you learn to do that?

18:16.470 --> 18:17.846
When I was but a wee devil,

18:17.888 --> 18:19.173
I refused to believe
a bow was just something

18:19.265 --> 18:21.551
my mother tied to my curly locks.

18:22.685 --> 18:23.720
My father agreed.

18:23.811 --> 18:27.178
He said learning to fight was essential,
whether you wore a dress or a kilt.

18:27.273 --> 18:29.480
He was a wise man, that King Fergus.

18:29.567 --> 18:32.400
I wish my father had been
as supportive of my adventures.

18:33.154 --> 18:34.860
He wasn't just supportive.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.687
He taught me everything
I know about shooting. Said to me,

18:36.782 --> 18:39.273
"Lass, if you remember
what you're fighting for,

18:39.368 --> 18:41.154
"you will never miss your target."

18:44.040 --> 18:45.029
Well...

18:45.333 --> 18:47.164
Looks like it was good advice.

18:47.209 --> 18:48.289
Aye.

18:48.711 --> 18:50.576
Now, is my potion done?

18:51.422 --> 18:53.333
Yeah, about that,

18:53.633 --> 18:56.215
do you know
what this potion will do to you?

18:56.302 --> 18:58.384
Think I would ask you
to make it if I didn't?

18:58.471 --> 19:01.554
But it'll turn you into a bear.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.176
No, it changes fate, is what it does.

19:03.225 --> 19:05.056
The Spell of Mor'du, they call it.

19:05.144 --> 19:08.728
Legend says that witch used it
to change the fate of a prince.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.429
Gave him the strength of 10 men.

19:10.524 --> 19:13.231
So you think that
turning yourself into a bear

19:13.319 --> 19:15.651
will make you strong enough
to rescue your brothers?

19:15.738 --> 19:16.978
I know it will.

19:17.073 --> 19:19.985
This isn't the first time
I've seen this magic in action.

19:20.076 --> 19:23.193
But Merida, you don't need magic
to change fate.

19:23.245 --> 19:24.405
How would you know?

19:24.789 --> 19:29.249
I just watched you split arrows
without blinking an eye.

19:29.293 --> 19:31.079
You can make your own fate.

19:31.337 --> 19:33.419
All you need is your wit and your bow.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.455
Isn't that a better way to prove to the Clans

19:36.550 --> 19:38.666
that you're worthy of being their queen?

19:39.720 --> 19:42.257
Afraid that's where you're wrong, missy.

19:46.310 --> 19:47.550
-(BELL JINGLES)
-Come on.

19:47.812 --> 19:49.097

19:49.188 --> 19:50.598
See? I knew you could make it.

19:50.648 --> 19:54.140
I should've known better
than to argue with you by now.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.185
Here.

19:59.365 --> 20:00.605
Now, what did we come here for?

20:01.117 --> 20:02.106
(GLASS SHATTERS)

20:04.203 --> 20:05.192
(GASPS)

20:05.538 --> 20:06.527
(BELL JINGLES)

20:08.249 --> 20:10.285
I told the Dark One you
wouldn't be daft enough

20:10.376 --> 20:12.207
to seek shelter in your own shop.

20:12.294 --> 20:15.081
But she said you wouldn't be able
to resist the pull of your magic.

20:15.131 --> 20:16.621
Merida, you don't have to do this.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.126
No, I tried to fight it. But I couldn't.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.715
So, now, her fate rests in your hands.

20:25.474 --> 20:26.463

is taking so long?

20:35.734 --> 20:36.940
Patience, pirate.

20:36.986 --> 20:38.772
If these spell books are correct,

20:39.155 --> 20:42.147
as soon as Arthur adds
the Crimson Crown to the cauldron,

20:42.241 --> 20:43.981
he should be able
to make contact with Merlin.

20:44.285 --> 20:47.072
Then we'll be speaking with him
before you know it.

20:47.163 --> 20:48.278
David told us everything.

20:48.330 --> 20:49.410
And you're willing to help?

20:49.498 --> 20:51.830
After everything you've done for us,
it's the least I can do.

20:58.466 --> 20:59.956
What are you waiting for?

21:00.801 --> 21:03.008
Perhaps it's best if I do this alone.

21:03.345 --> 21:07.008
Back in Camelot, Merlin delivered
his prophecies to me from inside a tree.

21:07.057 --> 21:08.968
But I'm afraid he only delivered them
when I was alone.

21:09.018 --> 21:11.054
Uh, this is too important to risk.

21:11.145 --> 21:12.681
Come on, let's leave him to it.

21:40.216 --> 21:41.205
(DOOR OPENS)

21:42.468 --> 21:44.049
Did it work?

21:45.262 --> 21:46.593
I'm afraid not.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.343
I thought the spell
was going to make contact, and then,

21:52.102 --> 21:53.603
itjust fizzled out.

22:24.927 --> 22:26.588
I can't. I can't.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.385
I can't. I'm sorry, Belle.

22:28.931 --> 22:29.920
No. I am.

All right.

22:42.236 --> 22:45.603
Come on. She's not going
to stay passed out for long.

22:46.865 --> 22:47.945
What's that?

22:48.033 --> 22:50.240
We may not outrun her arrows,

22:50.327 --> 22:52.238
but there's somewhere where this

22:52.329 --> 22:53.990
can keep us safe.

to save your brothers?

(INDISTINCT CHATTER CONTINUES)

23:16.437 --> 23:18.849
Tell me or this ends up on the rocks.

23:18.939 --> 23:20.099
Fine. If you must know.

23:20.149 --> 23:24.017
Not long ago, DunBroch was attacked.
It was an enemy from another land.

23:24.111 --> 23:25.647
My father fought side-by-side
with all the Clans.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.274
And I with him.

23:29.366 --> 23:31.698
As he brought us toward victory,

23:32.745 --> 23:34.736
I saw a helmed knight
heading straight for him.

23:35.289 --> 23:36.904
His sword raised.

23:38.167 --> 23:40.123
My father didn't see the knight.

23:40.210 --> 23:41.825
It was up to me.

23:43.213 --> 23:44.828
I had the enemy in my sights.

23:45.215 --> 23:48.343
I notched an arrow.
Pulled back the bow string.

23:49.553 --> 23:51.009
Took a breath,

23:51.096 --> 23:53.758
steadied my hand and let the arrow fly.

23:55.142 --> 23:56.643
But I missed.

23:57.394 --> 23:59.430
And the knight ran my father through.

24:00.856 --> 24:03.768
My father is dead because of me.

24:05.944 --> 24:07.855
No. It's not your fault.

24:07.946 --> 24:09.857
What do you know of it?

24:10.366 --> 24:13.449
I lost my mother in the Ogre Wars.

24:13.535 --> 24:15.617
I blamed myself, too.

24:15.704 --> 24:18.821
Until I finally realized the truth.

24:19.124 --> 24:20.830
It wasn't my fault.

24:21.377 --> 24:22.867
I forgave myself.

24:24.171 --> 24:26.662
You have to learn to do the same.

24:26.840 --> 24:27.966
I can't.

24:28.050 --> 24:30.792
The Clans,
they lost faith in me that day.

24:31.178 --> 24:33.043
That's why they don't think I can lead.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.127
(SIGHS)

24:34.682 --> 24:37.094
Now, can I have the potion or not?

24:39.436 --> 24:40.425
(SIGHS)

24:43.649 --> 24:45.310
Thank you.

24:46.276 --> 24:48.437
Now, let's kick some arse.

24:51.490 --> 24:52.650
(STAMMERS) Where are we going?

24:52.741 --> 24:54.652
The only place we'll be safe from Emma

24:55.077 --> 24:56.317

24:56.412 --> 24:58.653
You're taking us out of Storybrooke.

25:00.999 --> 25:03.536
This is anti-transformation powder.

25:03.836 --> 25:06.873
This will keep us safe from any
of the effects from crossing the town line.

No. No. We can't leave.

we care about in this town.

25:14.138 --> 25:16.880
I know Emma better
than she knows herself.

25:16.932 --> 25:19.344
She will keep coming
until she gets what she wants.

25:19.435 --> 25:21.266
We'll stop her. Together.

25:21.311 --> 25:23.302
Didn't you see
what happened back there?

25:23.397 --> 25:25.308
I couldn't even protect you from Merida.

25:46.170 --> 25:48.582
Belle, what are you doing?

25:48.922 --> 25:50.207
Come back in the car.

25:50.299 --> 25:51.288

25:51.425 --> 25:52.460
Please.

(STAMMERS) Don't you get it?

26:02.394 --> 26:03.509
I'm not a hero.

26:03.896 --> 26:06.558
-You've been brave before...
-When?

26:06.648 --> 26:08.604
During the first Ogres War?

26:09.610 --> 26:11.817
Let me tell you the truth about that day.

26:16.325 --> 26:20.694
I didn't cripple myself
to get back to my son.

26:23.665 --> 26:25.917
I did it because I was scared.

26:27.836 --> 26:28.825
Rumple...

26:28.962 --> 26:31.499
I joined the army to prove
I wasn't a coward.

26:32.341 --> 26:35.253
But when I had seen the wounded
coming back from the front lines,

26:36.970 --> 26:38.926
I didn't want to die.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.339
I'm a coward, Belle,

26:44.770 --> 26:46.431
and that's never going to change.

26:47.523 --> 26:49.684
Please, come back in the car. Eh?

26:50.192 --> 26:53.150
This is the only way I know
how to protect you. Come on.

26:53.195 --> 26:55.937
Protect yourself, you mean.

27:42.661 --> 27:43.901
And I'm not scared of you.

27:43.954 --> 27:46.866
Aye, but you should be. Because, now,
the Dark One's not taking any chances.

29:20.842 --> 29:22.753
What game are you playing?
Where's the real potion?

29:23.261 --> 29:24.967
You defeat the Clans with magic,

29:25.013 --> 29:27.004
the people still won't follow you.

29:27.099 --> 29:28.839
You need to defeat them as a queen.

29:29.851 --> 29:31.466
If you wanted to teach me a lesson,

29:31.520 --> 29:33.727
you should've done it
before we were surrounded.

29:33.814 --> 29:35.429
I knew you wouldn't face your fear

29:35.524 --> 29:36.684

29:42.531 --> 29:45.398
The only way you and your brothers
live out this day

is if you relinquish your crown.

to create peace between the Clans?

29:51.331 --> 29:52.320
Never.

29:52.708 --> 29:55.199
Clan DunBroch is the rightful leader
of the four Clans.

29:55.252 --> 29:58.210
And I am the sole and rightful queen.

At the movie theater when I was a kid.
How is that possible?

36:14.381 --> 36:15.791
You were still stuck
in the tree back then.

how I got my message to you.

36:17.717 --> 36:20.629

do you remember what I said?

You said

36:22.555 --> 36:24.546
something about Excalibur.

36:25.058 --> 36:26.264
And you told me...

36:26.351 --> 36:28.558
That one day
you would have the opportunity

36:28.603 --> 36:30.719
to remove Excalibur from its stone.

36:34.067 --> 36:35.477

36:35.568 --> 36:37.945
But the sword will return
to whence it came.

rests upon it.

38:25.553 --> 38:27.839
Just in case this doesn't work,

38:28.890 --> 38:33.133
I want you to know
that I am sorry for everything.

38:34.395 --> 38:36.727
If I had to do it all again,

38:36.815 --> 38:41.149
I would make sure I was the man
you deserved right from the very start.

38:43.821 --> 38:46.528
And, I would change everything for you.

38:48.201 --> 38:49.941

have been able to stop me yet.

are me.

He lied to us.

40:32.972 --> 40:36.260
I guess he didn't realize
magical toadstools don't burn.

40:36.351 --> 40:38.433
But why wouldn't he
want us to contact Merlin?

to get her back.

41:46.254 --> 41:48.836
If you're receiving this message,
then things are worse than I feared.

41:49.382 --> 41:50.918
I don't believe this.
