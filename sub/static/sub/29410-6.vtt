00:01.871 --> 00:05.527
[lock buzzes, latch clicks]

00:05.570 --> 00:07.224
[door closes]

00:07.268 --> 00:09.270
Uh, won't you take a seat?

00:09.313 --> 00:10.662
I prefer to stand.

00:11.707 --> 00:12.969
I've missed you.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.275
[scoffs softly]

00:14.318 --> 00:16.277
You don't even know me.

00:16.320 --> 00:19.236
Well, why don't we remedy that?

00:19.280 --> 00:21.064
Tell me something.

00:21.108 --> 00:22.239
Anything.

00:22.283 --> 00:25.242
I'm not here to talk about me.

00:25.286 --> 00:28.637
I came to ask for an interview.

00:28.680 --> 00:31.248
An interview.

00:31.292 --> 00:34.425
Seems a little exploitative.

00:34.469 --> 00:37.341
Then again, I've been exploiting
others my whole life.

00:37.385 --> 00:39.082
As a serial killer?

00:39.126 --> 00:40.257
No, as a white man.

00:40.301 --> 00:41.867
We're terrible.

00:41.911 --> 00:43.043
[chuckles]

00:45.219 --> 00:47.177
Oh, I don't know, Ainsley.

00:47.221 --> 00:49.701
Um, would I get the questions?

00:49.745 --> 00:51.225
Give notes on the cut?

00:51.268 --> 00:52.574
No.

00:52.617 --> 00:54.445
I'd hate to disappoint you.

00:54.489 --> 00:56.099
Then say yes.
[gasps]

00:57.927 --> 01:00.625
I've never asked you
for anything else.

01:02.714 --> 01:05.108
[exhales]

01:05.152 --> 01:06.327
Okay.

01:06.370 --> 01:08.242
You want to know the questions?

01:08.285 --> 01:09.678
How?

01:09.721 --> 01:12.115
How could you kill 23 people?

01:12.159 --> 01:14.161
When did it start? And why?

01:14.204 --> 01:17.033
That's the most important
question.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.383
Why did you do it?

01:19.427 --> 01:22.082
That's not
the most important one.

01:23.344 --> 01:25.694
Deep down,

01:25.737 --> 01:29.306
there's another question that
you desperately need answered.

01:29.350 --> 01:32.135
And I'm wondering...

01:32.179 --> 01:35.530
are you brave enough to ask it?

01:37.532 --> 01:39.534
â™ª

01:42.580 --> 01:45.061
[rain pattering]

01:48.282 --> 01:51.372
This one's a beaut, isn't she?

01:51.415 --> 01:53.287
Let me guess.

01:53.330 --> 01:55.680
You spent some time
in one of these as a kid.

01:57.204 --> 01:59.162
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

01:59.206 --> 02:00.729
Tons of room back here.

02:00.772 --> 02:02.948
It's, uh, perfect
for family trips

02:02.992 --> 02:04.341
or the big kill.

02:06.256 --> 02:07.475
Well, you know,
if you're into hunting.

02:09.390 --> 02:12.001
That was more my dad's thing.

02:16.310 --> 02:17.180
[jangling]

02:24.448 --> 02:25.971
Not the car of your dreams?

02:26.015 --> 02:27.364
It's not the right one.

02:27.408 --> 02:30.237
Y-You're after one car
in particular?

02:30.280 --> 02:32.543
That ain't gonna be easy.

02:32.587 --> 02:34.589
I'm looking for one with
an anchor bracket in the back.

02:34.632 --> 02:37.809
Strong enough
to chain somebody to.

02:38.810 --> 02:40.377
Don't worry.

02:40.421 --> 02:41.465
I'm a cop.

02:41.509 --> 02:43.511
Kind of.

02:48.385 --> 02:50.431
Thinking about your dad again?

02:50.474 --> 02:53.434
[inhales, sighs]

02:53.477 --> 02:56.785
You had that... faraway look.

02:56.828 --> 02:59.483
You weren't supposed
to sleep over.

02:59.527 --> 03:01.224
Don't do that.

03:01.268 --> 03:04.793
You've been acting strange
since you saw him.

03:04.836 --> 03:06.403
[exhales]

03:06.447 --> 03:08.231
You nervous about the interview?

03:08.275 --> 03:10.146
He hasn't even agreed to it yet.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.278
Well, when he does,

03:11.321 --> 03:13.367
your trusty cameraman
will be there

03:13.410 --> 03:15.412
to make sure
nothing happens to you.

03:15.456 --> 03:16.935
[chuckles softly]

03:16.979 --> 03:18.894
Either way,
you'll still look hot on camera.

03:18.937 --> 03:21.288
-Oh, is that so?
-Mm-hmm.

03:21.331 --> 03:23.855
[phone vibrating]

03:25.640 --> 03:27.250
JIN:
Whoa.

03:27.294 --> 03:29.252
That's some
seriously aggressive texting.

03:29.296 --> 03:30.732
Mm-hmm.

03:30.775 --> 03:33.517
Any chance you can save me
from my mother, too?

03:33.561 --> 03:34.910
-No.
-No?

03:34.953 --> 03:36.433
-But I can do this.
-[chuckles]

03:36.477 --> 03:38.043
JIN:
Mm!

03:38.087 --> 03:40.089
Okay.
[chuckles]

03:41.090 --> 03:42.744
[sighs]

03:42.787 --> 03:44.311
They're like...

03:44.354 --> 03:47.966
slivers of a memory.

03:48.010 --> 03:52.754
I-I think something bad happened
in this station wagon.

03:52.797 --> 03:54.669
I know it's a long shot,

03:54.712 --> 03:57.324
but if I can find this car,

03:57.367 --> 03:59.326
maybe it will help me remember.

03:59.369 --> 04:00.631
Malcolm,

04:00.675 --> 04:02.851
our minds aren't some safe

04:02.894 --> 04:05.419
waiting
for the right combination.

04:05.462 --> 04:06.985
They're messy,

04:07.029 --> 04:08.465
complicated.

04:08.509 --> 04:12.295
Gabrielle,
these memories are real.

04:12.339 --> 04:14.645
I'm sure of it.

04:14.689 --> 04:16.386
Okay.

04:16.430 --> 04:18.910
Let's explore the possibility
that they are real.

04:18.954 --> 04:20.390
Good.

04:20.434 --> 04:21.348
That's bad.

04:21.391 --> 04:25.090
It means a part of your psyche

04:25.134 --> 04:27.310
is built on repressed memories.

04:27.354 --> 04:29.573
Like a castle built on sand.

04:29.617 --> 04:33.490
Your mind is in a fragile state.

04:33.534 --> 04:36.885
My concern is, if you break down
too many walls,

04:36.928 --> 04:41.411
if you follow your trauma
to its source,

04:41.455 --> 04:44.327
you could revert back
to being that...

04:44.371 --> 04:46.590
frozen, broken child.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.290
How would I know
it was happening?

04:52.379 --> 04:54.511
You could start seeing things.

04:54.555 --> 04:56.905
Well, I already check that box.

04:56.948 --> 04:59.037
But these won't be drug-induced

04:59.081 --> 05:00.735
or from sleep deprivation.

05:00.778 --> 05:04.521
You won't be able to tell what's
real from what's imagined.

05:04.565 --> 05:06.523
It'll all feel real.

05:06.567 --> 05:07.785
I'd be psychotic.

05:07.829 --> 05:09.047
Mm-hmm.

05:09.091 --> 05:12.094
Lose contact with reality.

05:13.095 --> 05:14.705
That's your concern.

05:14.749 --> 05:17.317
You're my concern.

05:18.579 --> 05:20.320
Be careful.

05:22.017 --> 05:24.193
Hey, Gil, why am I here?

05:24.236 --> 05:25.412
Stabbing in the woods

05:25.455 --> 05:27.283
doesn't seem horrific enough
for a profiler.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.590
Try stabbed
over a hundred times.

05:29.633 --> 05:32.157
Just in time for Halloween.

05:32.201 --> 05:33.724
-Victim's name is Gavin Parker.
-[helicopter blades whirring]

05:33.768 --> 05:36.161
Queens address.
A warehouse assistant manager.

05:36.205 --> 05:38.163
His family's being notified
as we speak.

05:38.207 --> 05:39.382
JT:
Car's just up the road.

05:39.426 --> 05:40.731
Left the door open.

05:40.775 --> 05:42.559
Seemed like he was in a hurry
to get out.

05:42.603 --> 05:43.865
No sign of any passengers.

05:43.908 --> 05:45.214
Time of death?

05:45.257 --> 05:46.302
12 hours ago.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.738
He died from exsanguination

05:47.782 --> 05:50.175
from the extreme number
of stab wounds.

05:50.219 --> 05:52.177
And I thought
I was an overachiever.

05:52.221 --> 05:54.441
Is it me or do the wounds
look different?

05:54.484 --> 05:55.442
Nice catch.

05:55.485 --> 05:57.008
They are not consistent.

05:57.052 --> 05:59.184
Some are-are deep, confident.

05:59.228 --> 06:01.448
Others merely break the surface.

06:01.491 --> 06:04.276
A hundred stab wounds is
a classic case of overkill.

06:04.320 --> 06:07.192
A wounding far beyond
that required to cause death.

06:07.236 --> 06:09.194
Suggests an overwhelming hatred.

06:09.238 --> 06:10.457
Rage.

06:10.500 --> 06:11.675
Looks like the broken ankle

06:11.719 --> 06:13.460
-brought him down.
-Yeah. The killer

06:13.503 --> 06:15.287
didn't do that.

06:15.331 --> 06:17.551
The victim's car is
on the other side of this hill?

06:17.594 --> 06:19.204
Yeah. It's a straight shot.

06:19.248 --> 06:22.425
Someone was chasing him.

06:22.469 --> 06:24.035
He exits his car,

06:24.079 --> 06:26.429
comes over this hill,

06:26.473 --> 06:28.388
hits that root and falls.

06:30.477 --> 06:32.435
EDRISA:
It's a syndesmotic break.

06:32.479 --> 06:34.437
He would have been
in terrible pain.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.134
This murder wasn't planned.

06:36.178 --> 06:37.919
It was opportunistic.

06:37.962 --> 06:41.531
The killer used
Gavin's own knife to stab him.

06:41.575 --> 06:44.099
The angle of the wounds suggests
that the killer straddled him.

06:44.142 --> 06:45.492
He wanted the victim to see him.

06:45.535 --> 06:49.626
Yes. Or he needed
to see his victim's face,

06:49.670 --> 06:51.019
their pain.

06:51.062 --> 06:53.630
Our killer enjoyed this.

06:53.674 --> 06:56.938
Each stab,
they gained in intensity.

06:58.940 --> 07:01.638
Which explains
the varying depths.

07:01.682 --> 07:03.597
God, you're great.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.947
We're looking
for a nascent sadist.

07:05.990 --> 07:08.471
They're only now realizing
the pleasure they feel

07:08.515 --> 07:10.038
from inflicting pain.

07:10.081 --> 07:12.257
Could you at least try
to sound disturbed by that?

07:12.301 --> 07:13.824
This was their first kill.

07:13.868 --> 07:17.480
JT and Dani,
go talk to his coworkers.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.047
Bright and I
will visit the family,

07:19.090 --> 07:21.266
see why he was out here
in the first place.

07:21.310 --> 07:23.660
CRYSTAL:
I have no idea

07:23.704 --> 07:25.270
why he was out there.

07:25.314 --> 07:27.447
Gavin didn't say.

07:28.709 --> 07:29.840
Could you not?

07:29.884 --> 07:31.668
I just cleaned that.

07:31.712 --> 07:33.540
Sorry.

07:33.583 --> 07:35.759
[quietly]: She doesn't seem
all that broken up

07:35.803 --> 07:37.021
about her husband.

07:39.241 --> 07:41.243
[spritzing]

07:44.638 --> 07:46.640
You were getting a divorce?

07:47.945 --> 07:50.513
Uh, we hadn't told anyone yet.

07:50.557 --> 07:51.775
We were separating.

07:51.819 --> 07:54.778
Gavin wanted his own place.

07:54.822 --> 07:56.563
I wanted...

07:56.606 --> 07:58.695
a new life.

07:58.739 --> 08:00.305
This is where
you've been taking classes?

08:00.349 --> 08:02.003
Jake's. Yeah.

08:02.046 --> 08:05.528
I'm a new trainer there, too.

08:05.572 --> 08:07.399
And where's your son?

08:09.140 --> 08:10.925
Isaac's out back.

08:10.968 --> 08:12.317
Why do you ask?

08:12.361 --> 08:13.928
GIL:
It's just a question.

08:13.971 --> 08:17.671
CRYSTAL:
I just want to protect my son.

08:17.714 --> 08:20.804
Isaac is my everything.

08:24.721 --> 08:27.419
[dog barking in distance]

08:29.726 --> 08:31.815
â™ª

08:43.174 --> 08:45.568
Hello, Isaac.

08:45.612 --> 08:47.962
Who are your friends?

08:48.963 --> 08:50.704
This is Edwin.

08:50.747 --> 08:52.836
That's Jeffrey.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.056
They like to eat cabbage.

08:57.058 --> 08:58.973
How do they feel today?

08:59.974 --> 09:01.366
Sad.

09:01.410 --> 09:04.152
They... lost their dad.

09:04.195 --> 09:06.720
You know, I lost my dad
when I was around your age.

09:06.763 --> 09:08.678
Do you still miss him?

09:08.722 --> 09:11.202
Sometimes.

09:12.769 --> 09:14.466
When I was a kid,

09:14.510 --> 09:16.033
he was the best.

09:16.077 --> 09:18.601
He was smart and funny.

09:18.645 --> 09:20.603
He taught me so many things.

09:20.647 --> 09:22.605
My dad gave me
Edwin and Jeffrey.

09:22.649 --> 09:24.564
They're both very lucky.

09:25.695 --> 09:27.784
Were you brave
when you lost your dad?

09:27.828 --> 09:29.699
Mom says I have to be brave.

09:29.743 --> 09:31.614
I tried to be.

09:31.658 --> 09:34.486
But I was sad, too.

09:34.530 --> 09:37.141
It's okay to be sad.

09:40.014 --> 09:42.712
Do you think
that's the way your mom feels?

09:42.756 --> 09:45.715
I think...

09:45.759 --> 09:48.109
she's not that sad.

09:48.152 --> 09:52.243
She never really needed my dad.

09:52.287 --> 09:53.810
She needs me.

09:53.854 --> 09:55.203
That's what she says.

09:55.246 --> 09:56.596
I'm her everything.

09:59.294 --> 10:00.991
Who are you?

10:01.035 --> 10:02.819
I'm Bright.

10:02.863 --> 10:04.821
I work with the police.

10:04.865 --> 10:06.649
We're here to make sure
you're safe.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.129
You sound like Jake.

10:08.172 --> 10:09.739
Jake?

10:09.783 --> 10:11.741
Uh, from your mom's gym?

10:11.785 --> 10:13.743
He helped her get strong.

10:13.787 --> 10:17.138
He... sleeps here sometimes.

10:17.181 --> 10:18.661
Mom says to keep us safe.

10:18.705 --> 10:19.880
Did your dad know Jake?

10:19.923 --> 10:21.055
Did they get along?

10:21.098 --> 10:22.796
Not really.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.801
What's gonna happen, Mr. Bright?

10:33.067 --> 10:34.677
It's just Bright.

10:34.721 --> 10:35.722
[chuckles]

10:35.765 --> 10:38.463
Everything's gonna be okay,
Isaac.

10:38.507 --> 10:39.856
I promise.

10:44.339 --> 10:46.689
JESSICA:
We've missed you of late,
Ainsley.

10:46.733 --> 10:47.821
Where have you been?

10:47.864 --> 10:50.737
Working.
Researching a new subject.

10:50.780 --> 10:51.955
Lot of late nights.

10:51.999 --> 10:53.870
Oh, I hope
you're getting enough sleep.

10:53.914 --> 10:55.524
Ah. In other words, don't
turn out like your brother.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.658
What are you working on?

11:00.834 --> 11:03.488
I've decided to interview Dad.

11:03.532 --> 11:06.535
"The Surgeon: 20 Years Later."

11:07.536 --> 11:09.364
You must be joking.

11:09.407 --> 11:12.628
-Do I look like I'm joking?
-This is a bad idea, Ains.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.543
You're putting yourself
in his crosshairs.

11:14.586 --> 11:15.892
Why do you both do that?

11:15.936 --> 11:17.938
You treat me like
some delicate flower.

11:17.981 --> 11:19.940
And based
on billing hours alone,

11:19.983 --> 11:21.898
you guys are the basket cases.

11:21.942 --> 11:23.204
-I'm fine.
-JESSICA: Yes,

11:23.247 --> 11:25.946
because you are
the only one not seeing him.

11:25.989 --> 11:27.643
I have seen him.

11:27.687 --> 11:28.992
I went last week.

11:29.036 --> 11:31.516
What? Are you okay?

11:31.560 --> 11:34.781
-I just told you, I'm fine.
-None of this is fine.

11:34.824 --> 11:36.521
This is insane.

11:36.565 --> 11:38.654
[chuckles]:
An interview.

11:40.003 --> 11:41.788
I forbid it.

11:41.831 --> 11:44.094
You will not see
your father again.

11:44.138 --> 11:45.879
[laughs]:
What is that?

11:45.922 --> 11:48.751
A royal decree,
Mother hath spoken?

11:48.795 --> 11:51.972
I hoped we could have
a calm conversation about this,

11:52.015 --> 11:53.930
but obviously not.

11:53.974 --> 11:55.976
I'll see myself out.

11:56.019 --> 11:57.542
Ainsley, wait, we need...

11:57.586 --> 11:58.761
Let her go.

12:03.287 --> 12:05.594
That interview
will never happen.

12:05.637 --> 12:07.378
I will make sure of it.

12:08.379 --> 12:11.121
All right.

12:11.165 --> 12:12.819
Okay.

12:12.862 --> 12:14.342
Finally, we, uh...

12:14.385 --> 12:16.387
We agree?

12:16.431 --> 12:18.607
Well, I never.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.700
Still worrying
about your sister?

12:24.744 --> 12:27.224
Don't. I'm friends with
the chairman of her network.

12:27.268 --> 12:28.965
It'll only take a phone call.

12:29.009 --> 12:30.488
It's not that.

12:30.532 --> 12:31.838
What, then?

12:31.881 --> 12:33.970
Still lost in your past?

12:34.014 --> 12:36.016
[sighs]:
Oh, you know what they say:

12:36.059 --> 12:38.453
Those who can't remember
the past are condemned.

12:39.846 --> 12:41.456
That's not quite
the expression, dear.

12:41.499 --> 12:43.284
Close enough.

12:43.327 --> 12:45.939
Does this photo
mean anything to you?

12:47.854 --> 12:50.247
What is that hideous car?

12:50.291 --> 12:51.945
And where are you both?

12:51.988 --> 12:54.425
This was taken the week
before Dad was arrested.

12:55.470 --> 12:57.689
If I recall...

12:57.733 --> 12:59.474
[exhales]

12:59.517 --> 13:01.824
...I had gone with Ainsley
to the Hamptons,

13:01.868 --> 13:04.000
you were still in school, and...

13:04.044 --> 13:06.655
Martin was busy at work,
so he said.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.659
Makes sense, though.

13:11.660 --> 13:14.489
He lovedto camp.

13:14.532 --> 13:18.362
All the special clothes
and equipment.

13:19.973 --> 13:22.279
Made him giddy as a schoolboy.

13:23.106 --> 13:25.108
[sighs]

13:30.461 --> 13:32.724
Let me call Adolpho
to take you home.

13:42.038 --> 13:43.823
MARTIN:
Come on, what's with
the long face?

13:47.261 --> 13:48.697
Dad?

13:48.740 --> 13:50.046
[breath trembling]

13:50.090 --> 13:51.787
Wh-What is this?

13:51.831 --> 13:53.310
Don't be so worried.

13:53.354 --> 13:55.878
We're gonna have
a guy's weekend.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.011
I got us a car.

13:58.054 --> 13:59.621
The perfect camp.

14:00.796 --> 14:02.885
And Mother doesn't have to know.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.495
It'll be our little secret.

14:05.583 --> 14:06.889
[panting]

14:06.933 --> 14:07.890
[whispers]:
This isn't real.

14:07.934 --> 14:09.805
This isn't real.

14:11.372 --> 14:13.200
[distorted, echoing]:
Sound fun? Sound fun? Sound fun?

14:14.070 --> 14:15.898
[grunting]

14:17.944 --> 14:20.076
JESSICA:
Malcolm, oh, my God,

14:20.120 --> 14:22.905
-are you all right?
-I'm good. It's, uh...

14:22.949 --> 14:25.952
You don't have to worry.
I'm... I'm good.

14:28.519 --> 14:29.520
[panting]

14:29.564 --> 14:30.739
I'm good.

14:34.395 --> 14:36.571
I saw my little girl last week.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.488
She's asked to interview me.

14:40.531 --> 14:42.838
[chuckles]:
She really wants a...

14:42.882 --> 14:45.014
you know, relationship.

14:46.581 --> 14:48.583
With her dad.

14:48.626 --> 14:51.107
It felt wonderful.

14:51.151 --> 14:52.848
That's excellent, Martin,

14:52.892 --> 14:55.503
but I'd like to remind you
that today's group

14:55.546 --> 14:58.288
is about noticing each other's
signs of aggression.

14:58.332 --> 15:00.203
Oh, but I'm getting to that,
Stanley.

15:00.247 --> 15:04.077
Because I find that
I'm more prone to aggression

15:04.120 --> 15:08.951
when I'm grappling with
some kind of internal dilemma.

15:08.995 --> 15:11.171
-Such as now.
-I see.

15:11.214 --> 15:12.781
So on the one hand, uh,

15:12.824 --> 15:14.739
this interview
gives me the chance

15:14.783 --> 15:18.308
to finally spend some
quality time with my daughter...

15:18.352 --> 15:20.963
[takes deep breath]:
while on the other hand...

15:21.007 --> 15:25.402
there is a reason
why I've never discussed my...

15:27.187 --> 15:29.232
...exploits on camera.

15:29.276 --> 15:31.147
-And that is?
-Well, it's the same reason

15:31.191 --> 15:34.020
Vincent van Gogh went
to his grave a pauper.

15:34.063 --> 15:36.326
The general public...

15:36.370 --> 15:39.764
seldom understands greatness
in its time.

15:39.808 --> 15:41.418
Might there be another,
deeper reason

15:41.462 --> 15:42.985
you're reluctant to do this?

15:44.682 --> 15:47.033
The camera does add ten pounds.

15:47.076 --> 15:49.209
You crave control, Martin.

15:49.252 --> 15:50.993
Perhaps you're afraid

15:51.037 --> 15:53.561
to relinquish that
to your daughter?

15:53.604 --> 15:55.519
TEVIN [quietly]:
He should do it.

15:57.043 --> 15:59.349
Tevin, if you want
to participate,

15:59.393 --> 16:01.743
-you need to speak up.
-I said, he should do it.

16:02.831 --> 16:05.007
I wish I could've told my story.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.139
On TV.

16:06.182 --> 16:08.010
Set the record straight.

16:08.054 --> 16:10.012
-Why you killed your parents?
-Yeah.

16:10.056 --> 16:12.884
They were wicked.
Deviants both.

16:12.928 --> 16:15.365
They deserved what they got.

16:15.409 --> 16:17.628
People need to hear that.

16:18.629 --> 16:20.153
On TV.

16:20.196 --> 16:22.372
-Tell the camera everything!
-Hey, take it easy.

16:22.416 --> 16:24.809
-Easy. Let's go, Tevin.
-You have to do it!

16:24.853 --> 16:26.637
-Tell your story!
-Come on. [grunting]

16:26.681 --> 16:28.248
-Tell your story!
-Tevin, let's go.

16:28.291 --> 16:31.077
-Tevin, come on.
-Tell your story!

16:31.120 --> 16:32.643
-[latch clicks]
-Hey, maybe I'm wrong,

16:32.687 --> 16:35.429
but I think that was
Tevin's sign of aggression.

16:38.649 --> 16:41.435
â™ª

16:45.700 --> 16:47.223
Gil's on his way.

16:47.267 --> 16:49.095
[sighs]:
Thanks.

16:49.138 --> 16:51.401
Uh, hey, I need a favor.

16:51.445 --> 16:53.447
Can you run the license plates
in this photo?

16:53.490 --> 16:54.970
It's a partial.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.841
DANI:
And old.

16:56.885 --> 16:58.321
It'll take time.

16:58.365 --> 17:01.542
Should I ask what this is about,
or is knowing worse?

17:01.585 --> 17:03.239
The former.

17:03.283 --> 17:05.067
No. I mean, the latter.

17:05.111 --> 17:07.069
I always get those two mixed up.

17:07.113 --> 17:08.897
What's the profile, Bright?

17:08.940 --> 17:12.118
-Tell me about our sadist.
-Uh, okay.

17:12.161 --> 17:16.470
Your garden-variety sadist takes
pleasure from inflicting pain.

17:16.513 --> 17:20.126
On average, it takes three stabs
at a four-inch depth

17:20.169 --> 17:21.431
to kill someone.

17:21.475 --> 17:23.129
Where do you get a stat
like that?

17:23.172 --> 17:24.695
Our killer accelerated
his attack

17:24.739 --> 17:27.872
in order to deliver more strikes
before Gavin expired.

17:27.916 --> 17:29.657
What are the chances
this was a random murder?

17:29.700 --> 17:32.225
Unlikely. This began
as a murder of opportunity.

17:32.268 --> 17:34.227
Gavin's wife Crystal
certainly had motive.

17:34.270 --> 17:36.185
You know, they were
in the middle of a divorce.

17:36.229 --> 17:38.361
Computer checks show multiple
domestic incident reports.

17:38.405 --> 17:41.669
When unis showed up,
usually Gavin had the black eye.

17:41.712 --> 17:43.279
-She's a hitter.
-BRIGHT: But...

17:43.323 --> 17:45.281
she's very devoted to her son.

17:45.325 --> 17:47.283
She called him her "everything."

17:47.327 --> 17:48.589
That's what moms say.

17:48.632 --> 17:50.721
It's more than that.

17:50.765 --> 17:53.681
I think Crystal has
a Jocasta complex.

17:53.724 --> 17:56.118
It's the maternal version
of an Oedipal complex.

17:56.162 --> 17:57.467
Please tell me
they're not sleeping together.

17:57.511 --> 17:59.295
Not necessarily.

17:59.339 --> 18:01.558
A Jocasta mother emotionally
depends on their child

18:01.602 --> 18:03.256
like an adult partner,

18:03.299 --> 18:05.519
but they're not usually sadists.

18:05.562 --> 18:07.173
Enter Jake,

18:07.216 --> 18:09.305
Crystal's trainer and boyfriend.

18:09.349 --> 18:11.481
He has a history
of prior assaults.

18:11.525 --> 18:14.267
He even tried to kill a guy
in Bed-Stuy using Krav Maga.

18:14.310 --> 18:16.834
Israeli martial arts
will mess you up real good.

18:16.878 --> 18:19.054
Tell me...

18:19.098 --> 18:21.143
how will we know
if this guy's a sadist?

18:21.187 --> 18:22.753
[takes deep breath]

18:22.797 --> 18:25.321
I have an idea.

18:25.365 --> 18:27.715
Welcome to the world
of Krav Maga, Mr. Bright.

18:27.758 --> 18:29.412
How'd you hear about us?

18:29.456 --> 18:31.197
Saw a flier.

18:33.329 --> 18:36.376
I like your motto:
"We defend to the end."

18:36.419 --> 18:38.726
It's not a motto.

18:38.769 --> 18:41.207
It's a philosophy for survival.

18:41.250 --> 18:42.773
Cool.

18:42.817 --> 18:44.340
Got it.

18:44.384 --> 18:47.343
I've done, uh, kung fu,
jiu-jitsu.

18:47.387 --> 18:50.346
How do the belts work
in Grav Macau?

18:50.390 --> 18:52.218
Krav Maga...

18:52.261 --> 18:53.654
isn't a sport.

18:53.697 --> 18:56.265
The concept is to inflict
so much pain and damage

18:56.309 --> 18:58.833
that your opponent
can't hurt you ever again.

18:58.876 --> 19:00.269
Isn't that a little extreme?

19:01.227 --> 19:02.793
Life is extreme.

19:02.837 --> 19:04.882
Guys out there want
what you have--

19:04.926 --> 19:06.884
your money, your house.

19:06.928 --> 19:08.538
They'll take them, unless...

19:08.582 --> 19:10.627
-you're willing...
-To hurt them?

19:11.672 --> 19:13.108
[chuckles]

19:13.152 --> 19:15.371
Let me demonstrate.

19:15.415 --> 19:17.112
Show me some of that jiu-jitsu.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.244
Knock me down.

19:19.288 --> 19:21.203
[sniffs, clears throat]

19:27.253 --> 19:29.864
See that? Got your arm
in a submission hold.

19:29.907 --> 19:32.867
-Got it.
-See, Krav Maga...

19:32.910 --> 19:34.564
relies on one thing--

19:34.608 --> 19:37.176
maximum aggression.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.439
[grunts]

19:39.482 --> 19:42.006
Maybe this isn't your thing,
Mr. Bright.

19:42.050 --> 19:45.271
We do have a nice kung fu class
on Tuesdays.

19:46.837 --> 19:48.578
Ah, that's cool.

19:48.622 --> 19:49.927
Fine.

19:51.625 --> 19:53.148
What else you got?

19:53.192 --> 19:54.802
All right, then.

19:54.845 --> 19:56.673
I'm gonna come at you this time.

20:00.155 --> 20:01.591
What the hell?!

20:01.635 --> 20:05.378
Sorry. I-I thought we were going
for maximum aggression.

20:05.421 --> 20:06.379
[grunting]

20:06.422 --> 20:08.250
You want to see real aggression?

20:09.425 --> 20:11.427
-Do you submit?
-[strains]

20:13.908 --> 20:15.126
Do you?!

20:15.170 --> 20:16.563
[panting]

20:19.870 --> 20:21.220
[chuckles]

20:22.308 --> 20:24.875
What the hell?
You some kind of freak?

20:24.919 --> 20:26.486
[Bright groans]

20:26.529 --> 20:30.272
Well, Jung would have called me
a masochist.

20:30.316 --> 20:32.318
I'm not a fan.

20:32.361 --> 20:35.669
He would have loved you...

20:35.712 --> 20:37.671
an old-fashioned sadist.

20:37.714 --> 20:39.499
Who are you?

20:39.542 --> 20:41.979
Malcolm Bright.

20:42.023 --> 20:44.286
A profiler.

20:44.330 --> 20:46.245
And he's a cop.

20:47.507 --> 20:48.682
Hi, Jake.

20:50.031 --> 20:51.859
Let's talk.

20:54.688 --> 20:57.299
Didn't realize
I'd be running a marathon today.

20:58.996 --> 21:01.085
We're a quarter of a mile
from the crime scene.

21:01.129 --> 21:02.478
You'd think
she'd want to avoid it.

21:02.522 --> 21:04.132
JT:
Instead she's running

21:04.175 --> 21:06.308
-right into it.
-I'll follow.

21:06.352 --> 21:08.528
I'll try to head her off.

21:08.571 --> 21:10.094
I didn't kill Gavin.

21:10.138 --> 21:11.313
We pulled your records.

21:11.357 --> 21:13.533
Aggravated assault seems
to be your thing.

21:13.576 --> 21:15.448
Those are bar fights.
Punks popping off.

21:15.491 --> 21:17.928
I'm no killer. Or sadist.

21:17.972 --> 21:19.582
You definitely are.

21:19.626 --> 21:22.106
You got a massive endorphin rush
from nearly breaking my arm.

21:22.150 --> 21:24.544
Dilated pupils.
Flushed skin tone.

21:24.587 --> 21:27.373
For you,
hurting people feels good.

21:27.416 --> 21:29.331
You were also sleeping
with Gavin's ex.

21:29.375 --> 21:31.464
Do you offer that service
for all your clients?

21:31.507 --> 21:33.988
Yeah, I didn't see it
on the flier.

21:37.426 --> 21:39.515
This was east
of the crime scene.

21:39.559 --> 21:41.038
I think she's looking
for something.

21:41.082 --> 21:42.910
JT: Could be the knife
she stabbed Gavin with.

21:42.953 --> 21:44.738
-Maybe she ditched it
in the woods.
-Yeah.

21:44.781 --> 21:46.740
Better get CSU back down here.

21:46.783 --> 21:48.698
Have them expand
their search radius.

21:48.742 --> 21:51.397
Wait. She's digging.

21:51.440 --> 21:52.615
-Where are you?
-I'm a minute away.

21:52.659 --> 21:54.356
Okay, don't spook her.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.532
If she's tampering
with evidence, she might just...

21:58.055 --> 22:00.057
[exhales]:
I lost her.

22:00.101 --> 22:02.059
Crystal and I
are a casual thing.

22:02.103 --> 22:03.496
She got too much baggage,
anyway.

22:03.539 --> 22:04.584
What kind of baggage?

22:04.627 --> 22:07.587
[sighs]
Four months ago,

22:07.630 --> 22:10.590
Gavin demanded full custody
of Isaac.

22:10.633 --> 22:12.156
Drove Crystal nuts.

22:12.200 --> 22:13.984
[grunting]

22:15.464 --> 22:17.727
Every night,
she'd come in here, furious.

22:17.771 --> 22:20.034
I taught her
how to use that anger.

22:20.077 --> 22:21.340
What kind of thing
did you teach her?

22:22.602 --> 22:24.168
I taught her everything.

22:24.212 --> 22:25.474
[choking]

22:31.785 --> 22:32.829
[choking]

22:35.441 --> 22:37.181
[screams]

22:37.225 --> 22:39.009
[coughing]

22:40.576 --> 22:42.535
Don't ever sneak up on a cop.

22:42.578 --> 22:44.537
Yo! You okay?!

22:44.580 --> 22:46.582
I'm good. I'm good.

22:47.583 --> 22:49.542
Found the buried treasure.

22:49.585 --> 22:51.587
One bloody sweatshirt.

22:51.631 --> 22:53.415
Perfect for a fall night

22:53.459 --> 22:56.200
and stabbing your husband
to death.

22:56.244 --> 22:58.072
Hands.

22:58.115 --> 23:00.770
Crystal Parker,
you're under arrest

23:00.814 --> 23:03.512
-on suspicion of murder.
-[coughs]

23:08.865 --> 23:10.824
It doesn't make sense, Gil.

23:11.868 --> 23:13.609
JT's checking with the lab

23:13.653 --> 23:15.045
about the blood
we pulled off the sweatshirt.

23:15.089 --> 23:16.438
Nice collar.

23:20.050 --> 23:21.791
She killed him, Bright.

23:21.835 --> 23:24.011
The profile doesn't fit.

23:24.054 --> 23:26.796
Crystal is a Jocasta mother,
not a sadist.

23:26.840 --> 23:28.581
Which means that she cares
about her son.

23:28.624 --> 23:30.800
If she thought
Gavin was taking him away,

23:30.844 --> 23:32.454
taking away her everything,

23:32.498 --> 23:33.586
she would kill to stop him.

23:33.629 --> 23:35.022
They found her
at the crime scene

23:35.065 --> 23:36.458
trying to destroy evidence.

23:36.502 --> 23:39.592
A Jocasta mother is too
emotionally consumed by her son

23:39.635 --> 23:42.595
to stab someone over
a hundred times for pleasure.

23:42.638 --> 23:44.466
Maybe it wasn't for pleasure.

23:44.510 --> 23:46.337
Maybe your profile is wrong.

23:48.644 --> 23:50.690
There is a kid involved.

23:50.733 --> 23:52.561
Almost the age you were when...

23:54.737 --> 23:57.914
I could see how
that could get into your head.

23:57.958 --> 24:00.134
Don't beat yourself up.

24:00.177 --> 24:02.441
Crystal didn't do it.

24:05.748 --> 24:07.489
Let's find out.

24:11.188 --> 24:14.757
GIL:
That's Gavin's blood
on the sweatshirt, isn't it?

24:16.193 --> 24:18.065
DNA doesn't lie, Crystal.

24:18.108 --> 24:19.719
That's your sweatshirt.

24:19.762 --> 24:22.461
You hid it up there in the woods
after it happened.

24:25.551 --> 24:27.466
You killed Gavin, didn't you?

24:30.599 --> 24:32.122
Yes.

24:32.166 --> 24:34.168
I did.

24:38.564 --> 24:40.522
Did what, exactly?

24:40.566 --> 24:42.568
I killed Gavin.

24:43.786 --> 24:46.485
I didn't plan to, but...

24:48.399 --> 24:50.358
...he was taking my son.

24:50.401 --> 24:52.621
I had to stop him.

24:53.709 --> 24:55.145
Take her back to holding.

24:55.189 --> 24:56.712
I'll call the D.A.
and Family Services.

25:00.368 --> 25:01.717
Let's go.

25:08.724 --> 25:10.726
A Jocasta mother sadist.

25:10.770 --> 25:12.554
The profile doesn't fit.

25:12.598 --> 25:14.556
This one does.
I'm sorry, Bright.

25:14.600 --> 25:17.603
[sighs]

25:17.646 --> 25:19.518
I screwed up.

25:21.084 --> 25:22.695
You're a profiler,
not a psychic.

25:22.738 --> 25:24.697
You can't always know
who the killer is.

25:24.740 --> 25:27.787
No, not that.

25:27.830 --> 25:30.572
He's losing both of his parents,
and I told Isaac

25:30.616 --> 25:31.965
he was gonna be okay.

25:32.008 --> 25:33.706
I promised him.

25:37.405 --> 25:39.363
It's what you say to a kid.

25:39.407 --> 25:40.756
No.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.541
No, I lied to him.

25:43.629 --> 25:45.587
None of this is okay.

25:53.726 --> 25:54.683
[door closes]

26:01.864 --> 26:05.172
Ah, so this is how
we're gonna spend our day off.

26:05.215 --> 26:06.608
More work.

26:08.654 --> 26:11.178
I guess I could take

26:11.221 --> 26:13.659
-a little break.
-Really?

26:13.702 --> 26:15.051
-Tiny.
-[both chuckle]

26:15.095 --> 26:16.618
-[door opens]
-JESSICA: Ainsley?

26:16.662 --> 26:17.837
-Oh.
-Mom?

26:17.880 --> 26:19.795
What? I...

26:19.839 --> 26:21.667
I took your key.

26:21.710 --> 26:23.799
Well, it wasn't my only one.

26:23.843 --> 26:25.453
You must be freezing.

26:25.496 --> 26:26.497
I...

26:26.541 --> 26:28.499
Or maybe not.

26:28.543 --> 26:31.415
[laughs]

26:31.459 --> 26:33.113
Can I have the room, dear?

26:33.156 --> 26:34.418
[Jin exhales]

26:34.462 --> 26:36.638
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Whitly.

26:36.682 --> 26:38.292
Likewise.

26:39.510 --> 26:40.642
[door closes]

26:40.686 --> 26:41.817
What's the emergency?

26:41.861 --> 26:43.863
And don't say
my interview with Dad,

26:43.906 --> 26:45.865
because I've already contacted
the prison

26:45.908 --> 26:46.866
and written all the questions.

26:46.909 --> 26:48.476
It's not happening.

26:48.519 --> 26:49.912
What?

26:49.956 --> 26:52.001
I called an old high school
flame, Thomas James,

26:52.045 --> 26:55.526
your boss's boss's boss,
and asked him to put the kibosh

26:55.570 --> 26:56.658
on the interview.

26:56.702 --> 26:58.007
You've got to be kidding me.

26:58.051 --> 26:59.226
It's for your own good.

26:59.269 --> 27:01.707
No. It's for yourown good.

27:01.750 --> 27:03.360
I don't know anything about him.

27:03.404 --> 27:06.059
Everything I know has been
colored by your resentment.

27:06.102 --> 27:08.844
Well, that
and all the people he killed.

27:08.888 --> 27:10.803
Well, yeah, but still.

27:10.846 --> 27:13.632
You made him out to be
just a monster.

27:15.938 --> 27:17.897
Tell me what he said to you.

27:17.940 --> 27:19.899
[lock buzzes, latch clicks]

27:19.942 --> 27:21.074
MARTIN:
Deep down,

27:21.117 --> 27:22.728
there's another question

27:22.771 --> 27:26.035
that you desperately need
answered.

27:26.079 --> 27:28.864
And I'm wondering...

27:28.908 --> 27:31.650
are you brave enough to ask it?

27:34.870 --> 27:36.698
Was it real?

27:36.742 --> 27:38.569
There's my girl.

27:38.613 --> 27:41.529
Did you love us, or was it
just some psychopathic act?

27:41.572 --> 27:44.880
I've thought about you

27:44.924 --> 27:48.536
every single day
since my arrest.

27:49.972 --> 27:53.062
I'd imagine myself there
on birthdays.

27:53.106 --> 27:55.848
Piano recitals.

27:55.891 --> 27:58.720
Dancing with you
at the debutante ball.

27:58.764 --> 28:00.548
I was never a debutante.

28:01.592 --> 28:03.551
That's a shame.

28:03.594 --> 28:06.554
The one I dreamed of you was...

28:06.597 --> 28:08.556
quite the party.

28:08.599 --> 28:11.167
You demanded
the band play "Single Ladies."

28:11.211 --> 28:13.082
Mother was mortified.

28:13.126 --> 28:15.868
I, of course, loved it.

28:15.911 --> 28:17.739
[laughs]

28:19.785 --> 28:21.351
I need to go.

28:21.395 --> 28:22.788
Ainsley.

28:24.354 --> 28:26.269
That imaginary life...

28:27.618 --> 28:29.882
...is the most real thing
I know.

28:31.361 --> 28:34.625
The one place
I get to be a father.

28:35.670 --> 28:37.585
God, I'm embarrassed to admit

28:37.628 --> 28:39.587
how often I visit it.

28:40.588 --> 28:42.764
I will never forgive myself

28:42.808 --> 28:44.940
for not really being there.

28:47.595 --> 28:49.597
And neither should you.

28:51.599 --> 28:55.821
You deserved
so much better than me.

29:05.613 --> 29:07.180
He made you love him.

29:08.181 --> 29:09.835
What? No.

29:09.878 --> 29:11.619
No, of course not.

29:11.662 --> 29:13.926
I can see it in your eyes.

29:15.014 --> 29:16.580
I know what it looks like.

29:16.624 --> 29:18.974
I used to see it
in the mirror every morning.

29:19.018 --> 29:20.976
[sighs]

29:21.020 --> 29:22.978
You expected to find
the monster.

29:23.022 --> 29:24.153
Hoped for it

29:24.197 --> 29:27.243
because that'd be easier
to understand.

29:27.287 --> 29:30.246
But instead...

29:30.290 --> 29:32.901
you met a father who loves you.

29:36.905 --> 29:39.734
I happen to know
that Thomas James

29:39.778 --> 29:41.431
is on his way out.

29:41.475 --> 29:42.998
They're restructuring.

29:43.042 --> 29:45.174
So this interview
is going to happen

29:45.218 --> 29:47.046
whether you like it or not.

29:47.089 --> 29:49.657
And I know you're scared.

29:49.700 --> 29:52.660
But you raised a strong woman.

29:52.703 --> 29:54.705
I can do this.

29:57.273 --> 29:59.972
[Jessica sighs]

30:01.060 --> 30:02.801
Maybe you can.

30:06.108 --> 30:09.677
-[door opens, closes]
-[sighs]

30:16.684 --> 30:18.991
Your tremor has worsened.

30:19.034 --> 30:21.863
[sighs]

30:21.907 --> 30:23.430
This case...

30:23.473 --> 30:25.824
It's got me messed up.

30:27.913 --> 30:29.871
Tell me about the case.

30:31.699 --> 30:33.657
It involves a kid.

30:33.701 --> 30:35.659
His mom...

30:35.703 --> 30:38.924
supposedly stabbed his dad
over a hundred times.

30:40.142 --> 30:42.057
-That's awful.
-[Bright sighs]

30:42.101 --> 30:45.234
I keep looking at this kid,
wanting to help,

30:45.278 --> 30:47.846
but everything I do
makes his life worse.

30:49.151 --> 30:51.023
You see yourself in him.

30:52.154 --> 30:54.113
Why do you sound so surprised?

30:54.156 --> 30:57.594
'Cause your view on human nature

30:57.638 --> 31:00.119
can sometimes border on bleak.

31:00.162 --> 31:01.903
[chuckles]:
Um...

31:01.947 --> 31:04.471
I would say bleakish.

31:04.514 --> 31:06.038
[chuckles]

31:06.081 --> 31:08.301
Ah, that's what makes you
a good profiler.

31:08.344 --> 31:10.129
You see the worst in people.

31:10.172 --> 31:11.913
But with this boy,

31:11.957 --> 31:13.915
you want to see the best in him.

31:19.965 --> 31:21.923
I want to see the best in him.

31:23.359 --> 31:26.275
That's a subconscious urge.

31:26.319 --> 31:28.974
I suppose. It's only natural.

31:30.018 --> 31:31.498
Yeah, sure.

31:31.541 --> 31:34.066
But it means
I have an unconscious bias.

31:34.109 --> 31:36.024
A blind spot.

31:37.112 --> 31:39.114
I thought it was a good thing.

31:39.158 --> 31:42.726
Not if your job is to see people
for who they really are,

31:42.770 --> 31:45.120
no matter how dark it may be.

31:45.164 --> 31:47.166
I have to go.

32:08.796 --> 32:10.450
BRIGHT:
How do they feel today?

32:10.493 --> 32:11.973
Sad.

32:12.017 --> 32:14.584
They lost their dad.

32:14.628 --> 32:16.978
â™ª

32:30.600 --> 32:32.602
â™ª

32:49.097 --> 32:50.446
GIL:
This statement, once signed,

32:50.490 --> 32:51.708
will be admissible
as evidence...

32:51.752 --> 32:53.188
-BRIGHT: Hey!
-Hey!

32:53.232 --> 32:55.886
Stop! Don't let her sign that.
She didn't do it.

32:55.930 --> 32:58.019
Okay, Bright, that's enough.

32:58.063 --> 33:00.717
I know this is hitting close
to home, but she confessed.

33:00.761 --> 33:03.198
-We found her sweatshirt...
-It's not hers. It's Isaac's.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.028
You're saying a 12-year-old
stabbed his father

33:07.072 --> 33:08.812
over a hundred times?

33:08.856 --> 33:11.076
Yes, I am. And then
he hid the bloody sweatshirt

33:11.119 --> 33:12.816
like a bad report card.

33:12.860 --> 33:16.037
And when he told you, you ran
right up there to find it.

33:16.081 --> 33:18.213
You were protecting him.

33:18.257 --> 33:19.171
You still are.

33:19.214 --> 33:21.086
I'm not protecting anyone.

33:21.129 --> 33:23.001
I killed Gavin.

33:26.134 --> 33:28.745
You love your son,
but you've known

33:28.789 --> 33:30.747
he was different
since he was, what, three?

33:30.791 --> 33:32.053
What's in the bag, Bright?

33:32.097 --> 33:33.402
So you do
what a good mother does.

33:33.446 --> 33:35.404
You take care of him
by lying for him,

33:35.448 --> 33:38.712
keeping the other kids away,
hiding these.

33:38.755 --> 33:40.409
Tell us what's in your backyard.

33:40.453 --> 33:41.932
Or do I have to open this?

33:41.976 --> 33:43.064
Tell me what's in there!

33:43.108 --> 33:44.109
Tell him, Crystal.

33:44.152 --> 33:46.546
I can't.

33:46.589 --> 33:49.592
-Let's look at your son's
handiwork then, shall we?
-Stop!

33:51.246 --> 33:53.640
Is that a rabbit?

33:53.683 --> 33:55.642
It wasn't...

33:55.685 --> 33:57.252
It wasn't his fault.

33:57.296 --> 33:59.950
We took him to a doctor
when he was eight.

33:59.994 --> 34:02.562
And she said
he had conduct disorder,

34:02.605 --> 34:04.999
that-that some kids
are just different.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.783
Childhood onset
conduct disorder--

34:06.827 --> 34:09.090
it's an antecedent to sadism.

34:09.134 --> 34:11.092
Crystal...

34:11.136 --> 34:13.051
did Isaac kill his father?

34:14.791 --> 34:16.793
Gavin came for a visitation.

34:18.273 --> 34:20.841
He found Isaac suffocating
one of his rabbits.

34:22.756 --> 34:26.499
He told Isaac he was taking him
to a psychiatric hospital.

34:28.414 --> 34:30.459
Isaac knew what that meant.

34:30.503 --> 34:32.113
So he ran.

34:32.157 --> 34:34.289
Gavin chased him, he fell,
broke his ankle.

34:34.333 --> 34:37.336
[voice breaking]: He knew his
dad was taking him away from me.

34:37.379 --> 34:40.817
Isaac thought
he hadto kill him.

34:40.861 --> 34:42.123
We have to secure Isaac.

34:42.167 --> 34:44.125
If someone sets him off,
he'll turn violent.

34:44.169 --> 34:46.301
The social worker took him
back home while they look for

34:46.345 --> 34:48.303
-a foster family.
-Who's with him right now?

34:49.304 --> 34:51.611
[children shouting outside]

34:51.654 --> 34:53.134
Are you nuts, Isaac?

34:53.178 --> 34:54.614
You're not going
trick-or-treating.

34:54.657 --> 34:56.311
But me and Mom always go.

34:56.355 --> 34:57.486
Your mom's in jail.

34:57.530 --> 34:58.922
Social worker said
pack your things.

34:58.966 --> 35:00.272
They're coming, you're going.

35:00.315 --> 35:02.100
Nothing I can do.

35:07.975 --> 35:09.281
[Jake laughs]

35:14.024 --> 35:15.330
Fine.

35:15.374 --> 35:17.376
I'll pack 'em myself.

35:35.089 --> 35:36.177
BRIGHT:
Jake's still not picking up.

35:36.221 --> 35:37.352
-Keep at it.
-[siren wailing]

35:37.396 --> 35:38.745
[line ringing]

35:38.788 --> 35:40.573
[phone ringing]

35:43.228 --> 35:44.533
Hello?

35:44.577 --> 35:47.362
Jake, it's Malcolm Bright
with the NYPD.

35:47.406 --> 35:51.366
-Where's Isaac?
-He's here somewhere.

35:51.410 --> 35:53.760
Yeah, I... I told him
to pack his things,

35:53.803 --> 35:55.370
but he won't listen.

35:55.414 --> 35:57.546
Kid's acting
like a real piece of work.

35:57.590 --> 35:59.069
I need you to listen to me.

35:59.113 --> 36:00.984
Isaac is very, very danger...

36:01.028 --> 36:02.986
-[yelling over phone]
-Jake?

36:03.030 --> 36:06.120
Jake! Are you there?!

36:06.164 --> 36:08.383
-Jake?
-[whimpers, yells]

36:08.427 --> 36:09.993
Aah, you! [yells]

36:10.037 --> 36:11.212
Hello?

36:11.256 --> 36:13.606
Isaac, it's Bright.

36:13.649 --> 36:15.042
What's happening?

36:15.085 --> 36:16.348
What did you do to Jake?

36:16.391 --> 36:18.785
-[groans]
-He's not so strong now.

36:18.828 --> 36:20.613
Isaac, listen to me.

36:20.656 --> 36:22.223
I want you to run away.

36:22.267 --> 36:25.095
-I'm gonna kill you!
-I can't. He'll hurt me.

36:25.139 --> 36:26.706
Go upstairs.
He can't get you there.

36:26.749 --> 36:28.055
Do you hear me?

36:28.098 --> 36:29.578
[siren wailing]

36:29.622 --> 36:31.580
Isaac?

36:31.624 --> 36:33.234
Isaac, are you there?

36:33.278 --> 36:34.714
Arroyo to Central.

36:34.757 --> 36:37.412
Get tactical support and a bus
to the Parker house.

36:37.456 --> 36:39.109
Nobody goes inside
till I give the word.

36:41.503 --> 36:43.505
[siren wailing]

36:50.382 --> 36:52.253
[siren chirping]

36:59.129 --> 37:00.914
Guns down until we get inside.

37:00.957 --> 37:02.959
We have to contain this.

37:13.883 --> 37:15.276
He's still alive.

37:15.320 --> 37:16.321
GIL:
Bright told him to go upstairs.

37:16.364 --> 37:18.323
-I'm on it.
-No. Wait.

37:18.366 --> 37:19.976
I can talk to Isaac.

37:21.326 --> 37:23.066
I understand him.

37:23.110 --> 37:24.459
Please.

37:24.503 --> 37:25.895
Give me two minutes.

37:27.506 --> 37:29.203
GIL:
ESU is on the way.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.292
[siren wailing outside]

37:35.557 --> 37:37.559
Isaac?

37:38.691 --> 37:40.736
Are you up here?

37:55.360 --> 37:56.491
[Isaac sniffles]

37:56.535 --> 37:58.537
Can you put the knife down
for me?

37:58.580 --> 38:01.801
No. You lied to me.

38:01.844 --> 38:04.586
MAN [over radio]:
This is ESU.
A Team is in position.

38:04.630 --> 38:06.806
We have tactical officers
ready to enter the house.

38:06.849 --> 38:08.329
This is Lieutenant Arroyo.

38:08.373 --> 38:09.765
That's a negative
on entry, Commander.

38:09.809 --> 38:11.376
Have your men stand down.

38:11.419 --> 38:14.030
I have a civilian
with the suspect upstairs.

38:14.074 --> 38:15.336
Isaac?

38:15.380 --> 38:17.338
You made a bad choice.

38:19.166 --> 38:21.168
You can't hurt people like this.

38:22.561 --> 38:24.302
But there's time for you.

38:25.564 --> 38:27.000
You can still change.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.223
Are you gonna put me in jail?

38:35.051 --> 38:37.184
You need to go
to a special hospital

38:37.227 --> 38:38.707
where they can help you.

38:38.751 --> 38:40.709
They don't understand me.

38:40.753 --> 38:42.363
Nobody does.

38:43.408 --> 38:44.626
I do.

38:46.062 --> 38:48.543
When my dad was taken from me,

38:48.587 --> 38:51.198
I didn't talk for months.

38:52.417 --> 38:55.028
My feelings were so big
and strong

38:55.071 --> 38:56.421
that they shut me down.

38:56.464 --> 38:58.901
Almost turned me off completely.

39:02.209 --> 39:06.387
I know what it's like
to not be okay.

39:06.431 --> 39:09.695
To feel that something inside
is broken.

39:11.261 --> 39:12.828
Do you know that feeling?

39:12.872 --> 39:15.396
I'll always be broken, won't I?

39:15.440 --> 39:16.876
No.

39:16.919 --> 39:18.704
No, that's not true.

39:20.488 --> 39:22.490
Look at me.

39:22.534 --> 39:24.449
I got help.

39:24.492 --> 39:27.277
From my friends, my doctors,

39:27.321 --> 39:29.976
a cop who's here right now.

39:30.019 --> 39:31.456
MAN [over radio]:
Lieutenant Arroyo,

39:31.499 --> 39:32.587
our spotter has eyes
on the subject.

39:32.631 --> 39:34.415
Permission to engage target.

39:34.459 --> 39:37.418
[quietly]:
Negative. Do not engage.

39:37.462 --> 39:39.594
We're bringing him down.
He's just a kid.

39:39.638 --> 39:41.422
Can I see my mom?

39:41.466 --> 39:42.815
Yes.

39:44.469 --> 39:46.601
She loves you...

39:46.645 --> 39:48.386
so much.

39:49.822 --> 39:52.651
And she'll always be there
for you.

39:52.694 --> 39:54.696
I promise.

39:56.306 --> 39:58.308
Believe me?

40:03.966 --> 40:05.533
Can you give me the knife?

40:25.510 --> 40:27.163
BRIGHT:
The judge for Isaac's case

40:27.207 --> 40:29.905
cleared his admission
to Gardner Psychiatric.

40:29.949 --> 40:31.907
I told them to add me
to the permanent visitors list.

40:31.951 --> 40:33.343
GIL:
Good for you.

40:33.387 --> 40:35.520
Hopefully, they can help him.

40:38.697 --> 40:40.568
What is it?

40:42.527 --> 40:44.659
Uh, it's just...

40:44.703 --> 40:47.836
after everything
I went through as a kid,

40:47.880 --> 40:51.013
sometimes I wonder if I could've
turned into someone like Isaac.

40:53.146 --> 40:55.148
Not on my watch.

40:55.191 --> 40:57.324
Right.

40:59.413 --> 41:00.632
[sighs]

41:00.675 --> 41:03.069
Hey. I found that station wagon
from the photo.

41:03.112 --> 41:05.898
VIN, registration, everything.

41:06.899 --> 41:08.509
Thanks, Dani.

41:08.553 --> 41:09.597
Of course.

I got us a car.

41:34.579 --> 41:36.232
The perfect camp.

41:36.276 --> 41:37.669
And Mother doesn't have
to know.

41:37.712 --> 41:39.714
It'll be our little secret.
