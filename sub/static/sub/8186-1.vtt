<i>My parents were born
into the good life.</i>

01:02.771 --> 01:06.191
<i>Old money, blue blooded,
society sweethearts</i>

01:06.233 --> 01:08.902
- Are you hoping for a boy or a girl?
- We'll be happy with whatever we have.

01:08.944 --> 01:12.698
<i>Having played host to kings and queens
and other powers that be,</i>

01:12.739 --> 01:16.451
<i>they were used to gracing
the pages of the society columns</i>

01:16.535 --> 01:19.454
<i>So they welcomed
the attention...</i>

01:19.663 --> 01:23.750
<i>On what they supposed would be
the happiest day of their lives.</i>

01:24.877 --> 01:26.336
Hang in there.
Hold on honey, you can do it.

01:26.378 --> 01:30.090
Oh, my God!
I want to be sick! Oh, my God!

01:46.565 --> 01:48.650
<i>But local legend had it</i>

01:49.067 --> 01:52.112
<i>that a curse was put
on the Willhern family</i>

01:53.530 --> 01:56.783
<i>When my great, great,
great grandfather Ralph...</i>

01:57.701 --> 02:01.455
<i>had a fling with a lowly
servant girl... Clara.</i>

02:02.289 --> 02:05.125
<i>Who was soon eating
for two.</i>

02:05.459 --> 02:09.295
<i>When he told his family of his plans
to marry Clara</i>

02:10.631 --> 02:13.884
<i>He realised how silly
he'd been</i>

02:14.092 --> 02:17.221
<i>Clara was after all
just a servant girl...</i>

02:17.429 --> 02:19.598
<i>... and prone to rashes.</i>

02:19.723 --> 02:23.060
<i>Sir Ralph married someone
more suitable.</i>

02:23.101 --> 02:26.730
<i>And Clara...
fell off a cliff.</i>

02:28.273 --> 02:31.902
<i>That night Clara's mother -
the town witch -</i>

02:31.944 --> 02:34.196
<i>showed up on the
Wilhern lawn</i>

02:34.196 --> 02:37.866
<i>determined to give these blue bloods
a taste of their own medicine.</i>

02:37.908 --> 02:39.493
<i>She scattered about animal guts</i>

02:39.535 --> 02:44.748
<i>and commanded that the next Wilhern
daughter be born with the face of a pig.</i>

02:44.957 --> 02:47.543
And only when one
of your own

02:47.584 --> 02:51.004
kind claims this daughter as their own
'till death do they part'

02:51.046 --> 02:53.423
will the curse be broken.

03:00.097 --> 03:01.932
<i>Time passed,</i>

03:04.351 --> 03:05.978
<i>and as luck would have it</i>

03:06.019 --> 03:08.939
<i>the next five Wilhern brides</i>

03:09.565 --> 03:11.942
<i>gave birth to all sons...</i>

03:12.359 --> 03:15.696
<i>who fathered all sons...
who fathered all sons</i>

03:16.238 --> 03:18.532
<i>... who fathered all sons.</i>

03:20.284 --> 03:25.956
<i>Finally, born to Ella and Leonard
Hugh Wilhern... a daughter.</i>

03:26.123 --> 03:28.959
<i>A century of worry
for nothing.</i>

03:29.042 --> 03:31.003
<i>Of course, what they didn't know</i>

03:31.044 --> 03:34.464
<i>then was that Ella hadn't actually
given birth to a Wilhern.</i>

03:34.506 --> 03:37.509
<i>She had given birth to... a Jones.</i>

03:39.595 --> 03:43.223
<i>Which means that the first born
Wilhern girl...</i>

03:46.393 --> 03:48.061
<i>... was me.</i>

04:11.001 --> 04:15.047
Penelope.
Dear, sweet Penelope

04:15.672 --> 04:18.050
I'd given up all hope

04:18.091 --> 04:20.344
of ever finding a woman
who truly understands me.

04:20.385 --> 04:24.932
I had given up all hope that is...
until I met you.

04:26.308 --> 04:28.519
<i>I knew it.
He's the one.</i>

04:28.727 --> 04:30.479
He just might be.

04:31.188 --> 04:32.356
<i>You see...</i>

04:32.564 --> 04:36.318
...like you, I felt imprisoned
most of my life.

04:42.574 --> 04:44.034
Really?
...By what?

04:44.660 --> 04:46.328
Your good looks
and your good name?

04:46.370 --> 04:47.788
Yes, exactly.

04:48.622 --> 04:51.750
- No one ever seems able to see past that.
- No one.

04:52.584 --> 04:54.127
And Penelope.

04:55.087 --> 04:57.714
Dear, sweet Penelope...

04:58.298 --> 04:59.758
curse or no curse,

04:59.800 --> 05:02.886
if I am more
than my name and my face...

05:03.720 --> 05:06.849
well, then, surely you are
more than yours?

05:09.059 --> 05:10.727
Let me in.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.233
Penelope, let me in.

05:18.235 --> 05:19.570
No!

05:19.820 --> 05:21.071
Hi.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.031
What...?

05:23.448 --> 05:25.325
Help me! Help me!

05:27.911 --> 05:29.788
She's a pig!

05:31.373 --> 05:33.667
She's a killer pig!

05:33.709 --> 05:36.253
Help me!
Somebody help!

05:37.546 --> 05:39.882
Why, Penelope?
Why?

05:39.923 --> 05:42.301
I'm not the one who ran mother.

05:42.342 --> 05:47.014
Well, of course they run dear when you
spring yourself at them like that.

05:47.055 --> 05:49.683
Do you think I showed your father
my mole on our third date?

05:49.725 --> 05:54.521
No dear, no. I had the good sense to wait
until after we were married.

05:54.563 --> 05:56.273
I didn't show him my mole, mother.
I showed him my face.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.333
Mom.

06:18.629 --> 06:20.047
Oh, sweetheart.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.800
He really liked you.

06:24.218 --> 06:26.553
No, Mum, he really didn't.

06:26.553 --> 06:30.724
He didn't like your nose, that's what he
didn't like. You're not your nose.

06:31.433 --> 06:33.268
But, it... it is my nose.

06:33.310 --> 06:36.980
No! It's your great, great,
great grandfathers nose.

06:36.980 --> 06:40.609
On your father's side.
He did this to you... to us.

06:41.568 --> 06:44.655
But you are not your nose.
You are not you.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.657
You're, you're, you're...

06:47.157 --> 06:51.745
somebody else inside just
waiting to come out.

06:53.121 --> 06:54.957
<i>I had been reminded
over the years</i>

06:54.998 --> 06:57.584
<i>that I was not the
only victim of the curse.</i>

06:57.584 --> 07:02.005
<i>For starters along with my birth came
the knowledge of Aunt Ella's affair.</i>

07:07.177 --> 07:10.931
Damn you, Ella!

07:14.810 --> 07:19.606
<i>Even so no one suffered more
than my mother.</i>

07:19.940 --> 07:22.985
- These things happen all the time.
- To who?

07:23.026 --> 07:26.071
Did you know some children
are born with gills?

07:26.113 --> 07:28.574
Gills, sweetheart,
like on a fish.

07:30.242 --> 07:33.287
- So, can you cut it off?
- Strangest thing.

07:33.287 --> 07:37.958
But the carotid artery appears to run
directly through the nose.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.377
Or 'snout', as the case may be.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.297
Making any attempt at removal
unfeasible.

07:43.297 --> 07:45.048
The, caro... caro... what's that?

07:45.090 --> 07:48.302
What's he saying, Franklin?
What, what's he saying?

07:49.011 --> 07:53.307
She would die, sweetheart.
He is saying she would die.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.643
I'm sorry.
The snout stays.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.061
You...

07:58.395 --> 08:01.648
Oh... that's not true.

08:04.234 --> 08:07.321
<i>My mother meant well
She always meant well</i>

08:07.362 --> 08:10.991
<i>And always did what she thought
best to protect me.</i>

08:11.241 --> 08:13.076
<i>First, from reporters.</i>

08:13.118 --> 08:14.870
What are you?

08:16.330 --> 08:18.081
Ow, my eye!

08:18.916 --> 08:23.003
<i>But with the public demanding to see the
face that had caused so much trouble.</i>

08:23.337 --> 08:26.965
<i>My mother did what any
loving mother would do.</i>

08:27.007 --> 08:29.343
<i>She faked my death.</i>

08:29.468 --> 08:33.639
Earth to earth
ashes to ashes. Dust to dust.

08:33.764 --> 08:35.933
<i>And had me cremated.</i>

08:36.558 --> 08:39.895
<i>So with the public left to mourn
with my tragic passing.</i>

08:39.937 --> 08:43.232
<i>And with me safely hidden away
from the outside world.</i>

08:45.526 --> 08:49.112
<i>Now she need only worry about
protecting me from my father.</i>

08:49.154 --> 08:52.699
<i>Who was having trouble adapting
to the new morning menu.</i>

08:52.741 --> 08:54.993
Why can't I have
bacon?

08:55.035 --> 08:57.079
Because you love
oatmeal.

08:57.079 --> 08:58.997
Doesn't Daddy love oatmeal?
Yeah.

08:58.997 --> 09:00.749
No, I love bacon.

09:00.791 --> 09:04.294
<i>And from the insensitivity
of the new butler Jake.</i>

09:04.336 --> 09:07.005
And this little piggy
stayed at home.

09:07.506 --> 09:10.926
And this little piggy
had roast beef...

09:10.968 --> 09:14.054
Jake! Oh, Jake. Stop it.
Oh, the poor baby.

09:14.096 --> 09:18.892
<i>And occasionally she had to protect me,
even from myself.</i>

09:50.382 --> 09:53.385
<i>So I did most of
my playing in my room...</i>

09:53.927 --> 09:56.430
<i>Where I made my own friends.</i>

09:57.472 --> 09:59.975
<i>And learnt to entertain myself.</i>

10:04.146 --> 10:07.691
<i>While my mother spent her every
waking hour preparing me.</i>

10:13.030 --> 10:15.490
<i>Preparing me to be a suitable bride</i>

10:15.532 --> 10:17.492
<i>for the man who
would break the curse.</i>

10:17.534 --> 10:19.453
Quelle heure l'est-il?

10:19.995 --> 10:23.874
<i>Then upon my eighteenth birthday
she hired Wanda</i>

10:23.957 --> 10:25.584
<i>whose dating agency</i>

10:25.626 --> 10:29.046
<i>catered to the best and the
brightest blue bloods.</i>

10:29.087 --> 10:32.508
<i>In hopes of finding one.
One of my own kind</i>

10:32.925 --> 10:36.553
<i>Who would break the curse
by accepting me as I am.</i>

10:37.387 --> 10:38.889
Hello.

10:46.271 --> 10:50.150
<i>And upon their departure, they were
invited back to the house.</i>

10:50.734 --> 10:54.196
<i>Where they were legally
gagged into secrecy.</i>

10:54.238 --> 10:55.864
<i>And so it went.</i>

11:01.411 --> 11:03.330
<i>And it was just
a matter of time...</i>

11:03.372 --> 11:07.334
<i>before my mother recognised the need
for certain adjustments.</i>

11:07.668 --> 11:09.628
<i>Shatterproof glass...</i>

11:09.920 --> 11:12.130
<i>And sneakers for Jake.</i>

11:13.590 --> 11:15.467
<i>So you see today...</i>

11:15.509 --> 11:17.344
She's a pig!

11:18.262 --> 11:21.515
<i>... was much like any other.
Except...</i>

11:21.598 --> 11:24.184
- I couldn't catch him.
- Aah! I knew it.

11:24.226 --> 11:26.103
<i>I always said we should
make them sign the gag</i>

11:26.144 --> 11:27.896
<i>before they see her.
Not after.</i>

11:27.938 --> 11:29.648
<i>Don't worry.
We'll catch him.</i>

11:29.690 --> 11:31.191
<i>We'd better.</i>

11:37.865 --> 11:39.658
A snout?

11:41.869 --> 11:44.246
And fangs.

11:46.039 --> 11:50.627
Look, I know what I saw, alright?
Now, are you going to arrest her or not?

11:50.627 --> 11:53.297
On what grounds?
Ugly blind date?

11:53.297 --> 11:56.341
If being ugly were a crime, I'd have to
arrest half the people in this city.

11:56.383 --> 12:00.304
I know what you're thinking.
The Wilherns, nice family right?

12:00.345 --> 12:04.266
That's what I thought. And when
Penelope mentioned the curse

12:04.308 --> 12:08.187
I thought that was just a
figure of speech, yeah.

12:08.228 --> 12:11.732
It's not a figure of speech.
And they're not nice.

12:11.773 --> 12:16.153
I'm telling you if I hadn't of got out
of there when I did that...

12:16.195 --> 12:18.363
monster it would have
eaten me alive.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.532
That's it.
Put him in holding over night.

12:20.574 --> 12:21.241
Come on, mate.

12:21.283 --> 12:23.660
What me?
No, you don't understand

12:23.744 --> 12:25.954
I've come in to report her.

12:26.079 --> 12:31.251
- Hey, wasn't that a Vanderman?
- Yeah, Edward.

12:32.920 --> 12:35.130
That might be him...
no.

12:39.593 --> 12:43.180
Okay, you know what? Edward should have
been home by now, don't you think?

12:43.347 --> 12:48.769
Hello, anybody? Will somebody
call my mother?

13:22.052 --> 13:23.804
Rise and shine.

13:26.223 --> 13:28.100
Up, up, up, up, up.

13:29.476 --> 13:32.145
Come on, dear.
We're moving.

13:32.896 --> 13:34.231
Franklin.

13:34.773 --> 13:35.899
Mum?

13:35.941 --> 13:38.402
- Up, up, up, up, up.
- What?

13:38.735 --> 13:40.612
We're moving?

13:46.743 --> 13:49.079
Where is Larry Bonsa?

13:51.748 --> 13:53.250
Security.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.752
Poor Edward.
I had no idea.

13:55.836 --> 13:57.421
No, not that.

13:57.504 --> 14:01.258
Hallucinations of a hideous pig
pig faced girl.

14:02.009 --> 14:04.386
You do know who they're talking about?

14:05.929 --> 14:09.391
Oh, I don't know. Could be any
number of women in this city.

14:09.433 --> 14:12.603
I'm next in line for
chairman of the board.

14:12.936 --> 14:16.273
Do you have any idea what a story
like this will do to me?

14:16.315 --> 14:19.109
What my father is going to do to me?

14:20.110 --> 14:22.946
Well, that's not really my problem.

14:22.988 --> 14:30.120
Okay, I'm not a delusional maniac...
am I?

14:30.162 --> 14:33.707
No. So, either you
print a retraction

14:34.833 --> 14:40.881
or so help me god I am going
to rip your guts out.

14:41.298 --> 14:42.883
Security.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.135
It'll be twenty five years
ago all over again.

14:45.135 --> 14:49.306
Reporters popping out of draws.
Penelope will be exposed.

14:49.348 --> 14:52.059
And then... what chance do we have?

14:52.643 --> 14:55.395
- We could move to the beach.
- The beach is good.

14:55.395 --> 14:58.065
- Or France?
- You could practise your French.

14:58.106 --> 15:00.150
I could practice my French.

15:03.904 --> 15:04.738
Merci.

15:05.072 --> 15:07.157
Bonjour. Je suis Penelope.

15:09.743 --> 15:14.748
Never mind. I over reacted.
Wanda. Wanda!

15:16.124 --> 15:20.504
I demand a retraction.
You have ruined my life!

15:20.587 --> 15:23.090
I'm telling you she was
a pig. A pig!

15:23.090 --> 15:27.261
I'm telling you she had a piggy snout
on her face and I'm not mad.

15:27.386 --> 15:29.763
Why will no one
believe me?

15:30.180 --> 15:33.016
Wait, wait, hold, hold on there, Victor.

15:35.602 --> 15:38.230
I believe that man is with me.

15:39.690 --> 15:41.024
Huh? I am?

15:42.401 --> 15:46.697
- Okay, well first there's Hubert Strauss.
- Good. Who else?

15:46.697 --> 15:48.115
- Beaux...
- Great.

15:48.365 --> 15:49.575
- Jack...
- Fine.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.285
...the Ripper?
- Super, who else?

15:51.285 --> 15:54.246
You know what? Why don't I just say,
'Here's twelve men. Trust me'.

15:54.288 --> 15:57.082
Terrific. Let's talk about the dowry.
I think we should double it.

15:57.124 --> 16:00.544
If they can't stand me now what makes
you think they'll be able to for double?

16:00.586 --> 16:04.381
- Oh, now, now with that attitude...
- Oh yeah, it's my attitude, mother.

16:06.175 --> 16:08.969
This guy's got a lot of potential.

16:10.220 --> 16:12.181
I know he's going to look at her.

16:12.222 --> 16:15.058
What do you think of this guy?
Do you like him?

16:16.894 --> 16:18.562
Oh, sweetheart.

16:20.564 --> 16:24.276
I know, I know. It's not my face.

16:24.318 --> 16:27.446
it's my great, great, great
grandfathers face

16:27.988 --> 16:31.200
and he's not me, and I'm not him
and I'm not me.

16:31.241 --> 16:32.993
And don't you forget it.

16:45.255 --> 16:48.091
I gave my right eye
for that story.

16:49.843 --> 16:52.346
And I got back squat.

16:52.471 --> 16:55.098
And that hideous woman
still gives me nightmares.

16:55.098 --> 16:56.642
I thought you never saw her?

16:56.683 --> 17:01.939
Hmm. No, not Penelope. Her mother.
I only caught a glimpse of the baby.

17:01.980 --> 17:04.775
I thought my head
was playing tricks on me.

17:04.816 --> 17:07.444
Well, thank God someone
believes me anyway.

17:07.486 --> 17:11.114
Unfortunately, my believing you isn't
going to do either one of us any good.

17:11.156 --> 17:14.992
We're going to need some proof
to clear both our names.

17:16.869 --> 17:19.873
You think you can get back in there?

17:20.707 --> 17:23.042
Oh, I don't... I don't know.

17:24.795 --> 17:26.463
I mean, if...

17:31.885 --> 17:33.136
No.

17:33.470 --> 17:37.391
- Are you sure? I just need one photo.
- I'm not going back in there.

17:37.432 --> 17:39.476
Alright. Okay.

17:41.270 --> 17:44.314
We're just going to have
find somebody who can.

17:44.314 --> 17:46.066
Hook them up with the
agency that sent you.

17:46.108 --> 17:50.028
No, they only see old money, blue blood
types, it's part of the whole curse thing.

17:50.070 --> 17:53.991
We're not going to find any blue bloods
to help us, they don't need the money.

17:54.032 --> 17:57.244
No, but down and out
blue bloods do.

18:12.551 --> 18:14.136
Check.

18:15.470 --> 18:17.014
Bet.

18:20.601 --> 18:22.769
Read 'em and weep,
losers.

18:22.811 --> 18:24.104
Ah. crap!

18:29.860 --> 18:32.779
You got a Maxwell Campion
playing here tonight?

18:32.821 --> 18:36.033
That's him there.
Poker table number five.

18:54.259 --> 18:56.345
Hey, pal, wait up.

18:57.262 --> 18:58.430
Do I know you?

18:58.472 --> 19:01.767
No, but I know you.
Did a little research.

19:01.975 --> 19:04.811
And it seems in a few short years
you've managed to gamble away

19:04.811 --> 19:08.857
the fortune your family spent
generations building.

19:09.483 --> 19:12.903
Hey, hear me out.
I'll make it worth your while.

19:12.945 --> 19:15.113
You got the wrong guy.

19:15.656 --> 19:18.450
Five thousand bucks worth your while?

19:22.412 --> 19:24.456
We'll need your signature
on the last page.

19:24.498 --> 19:28.252
Just your standard gag.
You don't talk, we don't talk.

19:29.419 --> 19:31.797
Just how ugly is this girl?

19:32.631 --> 19:34.716
I believe the young lady is waiting.

19:38.887 --> 19:41.932
Wow, this guy is
wasting my time.

19:47.229 --> 19:48.897
Oh, he's here.

19:49.189 --> 19:52.943
- Hey, man, look, I'm sorry that I'm late.
- Alright, yeah. Take off the jacket.

19:55.028 --> 19:56.405
Alright.

19:58.073 --> 19:58.782
Hey.

19:58.782 --> 20:00.784
Alright, now... hey you with me?

20:00.993 --> 20:04.872
Alright, the camera is in the lapel.
The rigging is in the sleeve. Put it on.

20:05.998 --> 20:07.249
Come on, it looks great on you.

20:07.291 --> 20:10.794
Now to take a picture
you just raise either arm.

20:11.545 --> 20:13.005
Not now.

20:13.005 --> 20:14.339
Alright. Look, I'm sorry, man.

20:14.548 --> 20:17.384
Yeah, I know you are.
Did you have to gamble all night?

20:17.384 --> 20:20.679
Yeah, I still had chips.
I'm good?

20:20.721 --> 20:22.681
Yeah. Let's... come on, let's go.

20:32.274 --> 20:34.234
Don't worry,
I'll get that.

20:34.359 --> 20:35.944
And you are?

20:36.028 --> 20:38.614
I'm Max Campion
and the agency sent me.

20:38.655 --> 20:42.701
- Oh, right. Campion.
- There you go... shit.

20:43.243 --> 20:44.495
Excuse me?

20:46.580 --> 20:47.915
God Damn!

21:18.779 --> 21:21.907
Alright, dear, we've done as you asked.
They're all in the annexe.

21:21.949 --> 21:23.784
All of them?
All of them.

21:23.826 --> 21:27.412
But why you wouldn't rather talk to them
one at a time is beyond me.

21:27.454 --> 21:30.958
I told you mother this way it will be easier
to weed out the unlikelys.

21:40.050 --> 21:42.970
Hello, I'm Penelope.
And you must be?

21:46.098 --> 21:48.058
Late for tea?

21:50.561 --> 21:52.062
Jake!

21:53.605 --> 21:56.525
They're out, they're, they're running...
They've all seen her.

21:56.567 --> 21:58.819
Where's Max?

21:59.027 --> 22:00.779
Edward, do you see Max?

22:00.779 --> 22:04.658
I don't see Max. He's not there.
There's no Max.

22:18.922 --> 22:21.008
- How could you?
- Just speeding things up.

22:21.008 --> 22:23.093
Oh, and now you're just going to
make a pig of yourself?

22:23.135 --> 22:25.721
- No, that's already been done for me.
- Stop it.

22:27.097 --> 22:29.600
That was the last of the ho-hos.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.768
Where's your credit card?
I'm going to the store.

22:31.810 --> 22:33.228
No, no, no don't you... hey!

22:33.353 --> 22:35.606
If you want more ho-ho's
I'll send Jake for some.

22:35.647 --> 22:37.733
I'm old enough
to get my own.

22:37.774 --> 22:39.776
Pick me up some cigarettes.

22:40.194 --> 22:42.696
Penelope,
just one man, one man.

22:42.696 --> 22:46.992
And he'll run too. They always run
why can't you accept that?

22:47.201 --> 22:50.454
For seven years I've been
watching them run.

22:51.455 --> 22:55.334
Do you have any idea how that
makes me feel? Do you?

22:55.375 --> 22:58.253
I'm sorry,
but we just can't quit.

22:58.295 --> 22:59.254
Yes we can because...

22:59.296 --> 23:02.257
no matter how much
I want to believe

23:02.299 --> 23:05.219
there's one man who
won't run away

23:05.260 --> 23:06.720
one man who...

23:12.643 --> 23:16.188
Sweet loving angel of all
things merciful.

23:17.856 --> 23:19.399
Did he see?

23:19.441 --> 23:21.360
He must have.
He was there.

23:21.401 --> 23:23.570
- Who is he?
- Who cares? Just go!

23:23.612 --> 23:24.821
- Yes, go.
- No, I can't...

23:24.863 --> 23:26.490
- Go!
- Go!

23:29.117 --> 23:30.786
Damn it.

23:37.751 --> 23:39.753
You're still here?

23:42.172 --> 23:44.424
Did you see?
See?

23:44.675 --> 23:47.052
You didn't see?
I didn't?

23:47.261 --> 23:49.972
Did you?
Did I what?

23:50.013 --> 23:53.433
Don't mess with me.
What? I'm messing with you?

23:53.433 --> 23:55.602
Why are you still here?
Still?

23:56.770 --> 23:58.939
Fine then,
why are you here?

23:58.981 --> 24:01.108
Look I'm sorry. Should I go?

24:07.281 --> 24:11.034
Are you a fan of George Rockham?

24:12.077 --> 24:13.453
Who?

24:14.997 --> 24:17.082
The book you've got in your jacket.

24:19.459 --> 24:21.461
Oh, alright. You caught that, huh?

24:23.463 --> 24:27.384
Well... yeah.
Yeah, it's a great book.

24:28.635 --> 24:30.554
So you've read it?

24:31.388 --> 24:32.514
Well, yeah.

24:32.556 --> 24:35.184
Funny I thought that was the only
surviving copy.

24:35.225 --> 24:41.273
You know what? I meant to read it, but
the library was always out

24:46.153 --> 24:50.157
I saw it was a first edition
and I figured it might be worth something.

24:50.240 --> 24:52.117
So you were stealing it?

24:53.660 --> 24:56.163
Well... Yeah. I was stealing it.

24:57.748 --> 25:00.167
So, you're a fan of the money?

25:01.168 --> 25:05.881
I'm a big fan of the money.
Although, it doesn't much care for me.

25:05.923 --> 25:09.009
Well, maybe you and the money
weren't meant to be.

25:09.051 --> 25:12.137
Hey, I wouldn't go that far.
Jinx me.

25:14.348 --> 25:17.768
There are 326 first editions
in that room.

25:17.976 --> 25:21.605
Of those, 300 are worth
over 50,000.

25:22.147 --> 25:25.484
A dozen or so are worth
over 25,000.

25:26.026 --> 25:29.238
And I'm afraid there's only one
that's valued under a hundred.

25:29.363 --> 25:30.364
Only one, huh?

25:30.364 --> 25:34.785
A little novel, written by a little
nobody, that never amounted to anything.

25:35.786 --> 25:38.539
You don't say. Under a hundred?

25:39.248 --> 25:43.544
I'm afraid so. And...
I'm afraid that it's time for...

25:43.544 --> 25:46.463
- But it's your favourite just the same?
- What?

25:47.047 --> 25:49.132
I said,
'your favourite just the same'.

25:49.174 --> 25:50.509
I heard you.

25:55.806 --> 25:58.809
Top shelf,
third from the left,

25:58.851 --> 26:01.770
'Moby Dick'.
It's a first edition.

26:03.021 --> 26:05.941
But wait till I'm gone
or they'll see you.

26:06.358 --> 26:07.818
See me?

26:09.486 --> 26:10.737
What?

26:16.076 --> 26:17.411
Hello?

26:19.496 --> 26:21.165
<i>Hello?</i>

26:48.692 --> 26:50.027
Got ya!

26:53.488 --> 26:54.948
No?

27:00.287 --> 27:01.705
Penelope?

27:10.380 --> 27:11.715
Penelope?

27:34.988 --> 27:36.865
Will you be back tomorrow?

27:37.074 --> 27:40.327
I knew it.
I knew you were there.

27:41.245 --> 27:42.496
Yeah.

27:51.755 --> 27:54.258
- He'll be back.
- He will.

27:58.846 --> 28:01.890
- So?
- I didn't get it.

28:02.432 --> 28:04.184
How could you not get it,
half the men in this city...

28:04.226 --> 28:06.770
Relax.
I'm coming back tomorrow.

28:09.815 --> 28:10.858
Ow! Door.

28:11.483 --> 28:12.943
You better.

28:13.694 --> 28:15.112
See you tomorrow.

28:16.905 --> 28:18.448
Better.

28:30.878 --> 28:33.297
Sweetheart? What's wrong?

28:35.132 --> 28:38.468
I thought he just knew,
but it says it right here.

28:40.971 --> 28:42.556
Still he chose it.

28:42.598 --> 28:44.850
Of the 2,000 that aren't
your favourite,

28:44.892 --> 28:47.060
he chose the one that is.

29:35.526 --> 29:36.777
Alright. Alright.

29:57.005 --> 29:58.257
<i>Do you play?</i>

30:01.385 --> 30:03.679
I wish you'd stop
doing that.

30:03.720 --> 30:05.305
- Do you play?
- The frog?

30:05.347 --> 30:08.809
No, no although I always meant
to pick it up.

30:08.976 --> 30:10.978
But you do play something.

30:13.272 --> 30:16.191
- What makes you say that?
- What do you play?

30:21.321 --> 30:22.739
Guess.

30:25.492 --> 30:27.119
Is this really necessary?

30:27.161 --> 30:29.413
She's finding
his instrument.

30:29.413 --> 30:32.040
Isn't that something a man
should do for himself?

30:32.166 --> 30:33.917
<i>And a one, and a two, and a one.</i>

30:34.126 --> 30:37.880
<i>You are my sunshine,
my only sunshine</i>

30:38.088 --> 30:42.342
<i>You make me happy
when skies are grey.</i>

30:42.759 --> 30:46.221
<i>You'll never know, dear
dear how much I love you.</i>

30:46.263 --> 30:47.556
Are you even playing that?

30:47.598 --> 30:51.101
<i>So please don't take
my sunshine away.</i>

30:51.143 --> 30:53.312
- Okay, it's not the bass.
- No? No?

30:53.729 --> 30:55.564
- Try the drums.
- Alright.

30:55.606 --> 30:57.357
The drums, you play drums.

30:59.359 --> 31:00.611
Okay.

31:04.281 --> 31:09.369
<i>So please don't take...
my sunshine away.</i>

31:09.578 --> 31:12.372
Okay, okay, no, no, no.
No more drums.

31:12.915 --> 31:16.251
No?
Not the drums, it's not the drums...

31:17.503 --> 31:18.462
<i>Alright!</i>

31:18.462 --> 31:20.130
Saxophone, saxophone!

31:20.547 --> 31:21.965
You want sax?

31:26.887 --> 31:30.224
One... two... one, two.

31:35.646 --> 31:39.149
Enough, stop. Stop, stop!

31:39.191 --> 31:42.653
- Enough.
- No? No, alright.

31:42.736 --> 31:44.905
Play the guitar.
The guitar.

31:45.155 --> 31:47.741
Guitar.
It's got to be the guitar.

31:54.414 --> 31:57.334
I don't think that's how
you play the guitar.

32:13.392 --> 32:19.231
Okay, stop, stop. stop!
Please stop, stop.

32:22.150 --> 32:25.195
Oh, my.
That was, that was terrible.

32:25.279 --> 32:26.071
Hey everybody, everybody wave.

32:26.113 --> 32:28.949
Everybody wave to Penelope
and take a bow, alright? And bow.

32:30.784 --> 32:34.121
I know, I know you guys
you were fantastic

32:34.246 --> 32:35.789
though come here.
Thank you so much for everything.

32:35.831 --> 32:37.374
Wait, wait
I'm not done guessing.

32:37.457 --> 32:41.628
Come on, enough about me.
What do you play?

32:45.215 --> 32:48.135
You want to be a hortomacultural what?

32:48.218 --> 32:51.471
A horticulturalist.
You know? Someone who works with plants.

32:51.638 --> 32:52.723
Right.

32:53.724 --> 32:54.850
Why is that funny?

32:54.892 --> 32:59.980
No plants are great. I just thought
of you as like... like a cop.

33:00.230 --> 33:03.150
You know seeing as you've got
the whole interrogation thing down.

33:03.233 --> 33:05.319
Shut up, it's your move.

33:06.487 --> 33:08.030
Alright.

33:09.281 --> 33:12.242
- Oh, you really don't want to do that.
- Why not?

33:12.284 --> 33:15.579
- Because I'll kill her.
- What if I asked you not to?

33:15.621 --> 33:18.874
I'd still kill her.
You'd sort of be begging me to.

33:19.708 --> 33:22.753
So, beer.
You've never had a beer?

33:22.920 --> 33:24.171
I've had a beer.

33:24.171 --> 33:26.256
- On tap?
- No, not on tap.

33:26.298 --> 33:28.342
Well, then you've never had a beer.

33:28.342 --> 33:30.969
- Your knight can't do that.
- My knight?

33:31.094 --> 33:33.180
- The horse.
- Alright.

33:35.974 --> 33:39.311
Hey, how about you and me heading down
to the Cloverdilly pub right now?

33:39.603 --> 33:41.522
Pub Cloverdilly?

33:41.688 --> 33:45.984
Best beer, best blues, some
of the best beer bums in town.

33:46.026 --> 33:48.070
Thanks, maybe later.

33:51.281 --> 33:53.075
Penelope, come on.

33:58.080 --> 34:01.542
Come on, you've got to
get out of there sometime.

34:02.251 --> 34:03.377
Right?

34:05.379 --> 34:07.464
What are you waiting for?

34:26.233 --> 34:30.195
You know, truth is, you're...
you're not missing much.

34:33.239 --> 34:36.743
Really?
The Cloverdilly pub sounds fun.

34:36.994 --> 34:39.079
Yeah, but... aside from that.

34:39.913 --> 34:44.168
And the street fairs? I hear they sell
really cool stuff right on the street.

34:44.501 --> 34:47.504
You know, the vendors themselves
are pretty cool too.

34:47.545 --> 34:50.007
- Oh, and the park?
- The park is great.

34:51.675 --> 34:53.302
I used to spend
every weekend there

34:53.342 --> 34:56.722
just hanging on a bench
writing stupid love songs...

34:56.763 --> 35:00.100
- People watching.
- Used to? You don't do that anymore?

35:04.813 --> 35:06.690
What are you doing instead?

35:11.487 --> 35:15.449
- Well, beating you at chess.
- I warned you I'd kill her.

35:15.491 --> 35:18.452
That's great because as soon as my guys
here have seen what you've done...

35:18.494 --> 35:20.120
The game will be over,
your queen will be dead.

35:20.162 --> 35:22.456
My king's still pretty active, you know?

35:22.539 --> 35:25.375
Once the queers dead
the kings useless.

35:26.710 --> 35:29.213
- What's that about?
- I don't know?

35:30.130 --> 35:33.717
Maybe he's too depressed to fight.
He really loved her you know?

35:37.888 --> 35:39.431
Yeah, I can see that.

35:41.850 --> 35:44.436
My queen to yours,
checkmate.

35:44.728 --> 35:46.313
You got me.

36:07.084 --> 36:09.670
Man,
what is this guy doing?

36:10.003 --> 36:12.172
Wasting all my film.

36:12.381 --> 36:15.926
He's doing it on purpose.
He's going for the dowry.

36:15.968 --> 36:19.054
I wish I could find a girl
with a dowry.

36:19.596 --> 36:20.889
Give me a break.

36:20.931 --> 36:24.768
Why else would it be taking you so long?
She revealed herself to me straight away.

36:24.810 --> 36:27.604
You know what?
I guess she liked you more.

36:28.355 --> 36:31.775
Why settle for five thousand when
you could get ten times that, right?

36:31.817 --> 36:35.946
Well, maybe you're forgetting -
I've seen her. She is grotesque.

36:35.988 --> 36:36.864
Shut him up.

36:36.864 --> 36:40.450
I'm talking un-kissable
ugly. Nightmare ugly.

36:41.285 --> 36:47.207
Listen you little worm. I know your
kind spoiled rotten mama's boy...

36:47.249 --> 36:49.293
God! He licked me.

36:49.334 --> 36:50.669
- Edward.
- What?

36:50.669 --> 36:52.212
Don't lick Max.

36:52.629 --> 36:53.672
Sorry.

36:54.214 --> 36:56.175
Listen you can't blame us
for being a little suspicious.

36:56.216 --> 36:59.928
- Fine, find someone else.
- Fine, give us back the money.

37:15.986 --> 37:18.989
It's starting. It's starting!
Would you come on!

37:20.657 --> 37:22.659
<i>Okay, I've got it. Piano.</i>

37:23.577 --> 37:27.039
You play the piano.
I bet my life on it.

37:27.331 --> 37:31.210
Alright, keep in mind;
'never bet a better'.

37:34.838 --> 37:37.049
Does he have another jacket?

37:42.179 --> 37:44.640
And a one, and a two and a one...

37:44.765 --> 37:48.810
<i>You are my sunshine...</i>

37:50.103 --> 37:53.607
<i>My only sunshine...</i>

37:54.358 --> 37:59.988
<i>You make me happy
No, it's B flat.</i>

38:04.993 --> 38:07.204
B flat on the right hand.

38:10.541 --> 38:12.709
No, right hand!

38:24.888 --> 38:29.059
You see, the left hand stays, and
the right hand plays the chord.

38:34.189 --> 38:36.567
- You see?
- Yeah, yeah. It's better.

39:19.943 --> 39:22.362
- Shit!
- I'm a monster.

39:22.571 --> 39:24.448
No, no your not,
Penelope!

39:36.210 --> 39:37.794
Stay with Max.

39:39.796 --> 39:41.673
Darling, do not...
Please, do not...

39:41.673 --> 39:43.842
I told you! I told you!

39:43.884 --> 39:45.928
No, you ran.
It was you this time.

39:45.969 --> 39:47.679
- He said 'shit'
- Big shit.

39:47.721 --> 39:49.389
He said 'shit'
to me twice.

39:49.389 --> 39:51.642
And then he just stood there
staring at me.

39:51.683 --> 39:53.393
No one's ever just stood
there before.

39:53.435 --> 39:57.064
If you give the poor boy a chance to
adjust. I mean, put yourself in...

39:57.105 --> 40:01.652
What are you doing?
I told you to stay with him.

40:01.902 --> 40:04.154
You did?
I didn't hear you.

40:09.159 --> 40:10.327
When you said,
'stay with Max'...

40:10.369 --> 40:11.745
I meant
stay with Max.

40:11.787 --> 40:13.997
You never said,
'Wanda, stay with him'.

40:16.500 --> 40:19.503
<i>- I told you!
- I'm sorry I didn't hear you.</i>

40:23.382 --> 40:24.383
Mom?

40:24.424 --> 40:27.219
Don't worry, dear.
He couldn't have gone far

40:29.721 --> 40:32.099
- Did you get it?
- Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

40:35.352 --> 40:37.187
Hey, I needed that photo.

40:37.229 --> 40:40.566
She's not what Edward said she was.
You just leave her alone.

40:42.442 --> 40:43.777
Lemon?

40:47.114 --> 40:49.074
- Who is that?
- Lock the gate!

40:49.116 --> 40:50.993
No, don't, don't shut the gate!

40:55.164 --> 40:58.375
I got him, I got him.

40:58.500 --> 41:02.546
Penelope, there's something
I have to tell you.

41:02.754 --> 41:04.631
- No, he's a spy.
- No... yes.

41:04.631 --> 41:06.592
Yes, he's a spy.
He's working for Lemon,

41:06.633 --> 41:08.886
The reporter who forced me
to bury you.

41:08.886 --> 41:10.971
- You said I was cremated.
- That too.

41:11.013 --> 41:13.807
I hope you were well paid, because
you just said goodbye to a fortune.

41:13.932 --> 41:16.977
Wait!
He's still one of your own kind.

41:16.977 --> 41:18.687
He could still break the curse.

41:18.729 --> 41:23.400
Max. I know this face
repulses you...

41:23.400 --> 41:27.070
And I... and I wouldn't dream of
asking you to accept it.

41:27.279 --> 41:28.947
But this isn't me.

41:28.989 --> 41:32.910
The real me is inside here
somewhere just waiting to get out.

41:33.118 --> 41:35.162
And you can
make that happen.

41:35.204 --> 41:38.540
Once the curse is broken
I'll be just like anybody else.

41:38.582 --> 41:42.711
What if you're not?
What if the curse isn't broken.

41:43.003 --> 41:46.423
What if... what if the curse can
never be broken?

41:46.465 --> 41:49.801
Then I'll kill myself. I promise.
I promise I will.

41:50.511 --> 41:52.012
Marry me, Max.

41:56.058 --> 41:57.601
Marry me.

42:06.902 --> 42:08.153
I can't.

42:12.616 --> 42:13.659
Get out!

42:14.952 --> 42:16.078
- I'm...
- Get out!

42:16.787 --> 42:18.372
- Get out!
- Out!

42:18.997 --> 42:21.083
Right out!

42:45.482 --> 42:47.985
Okay,
this is what we're going to do...

42:48.026 --> 42:51.196
<i>I felt the rush
of a thousand heart breaks.</i>

42:51.655 --> 42:54.741
This is nothing we haven't been
through before.

42:55.075 --> 42:57.995
<i>Penelope,
we can do it again.</i>

43:00.289 --> 43:02.583
<i>I will never give up, sweetheart.</i>

43:04.168 --> 43:06.044
Never, Penelope!

43:10.090 --> 43:14.595
<i>And I knew with all my heart
she meant it.</i>

44:25.666 --> 44:28.919
<i>We have both always
known there was no guarantee.</i>

44:28.961 --> 44:32.256
We have not both always known
that there was no guarantee.

44:32.297 --> 44:34.216
We have spent
so much time preparing her

44:34.258 --> 44:35.968
for the day things
would be different,

44:36.009 --> 44:39.012
we've never prepared her
for the day that they're not.

44:39.429 --> 44:43.308
Maybe we should stop all
this match making and...

44:43.600 --> 44:45.811
give her a puppy. Hmm?

44:48.730 --> 44:50.816
Sweetheart?
Penelope is that you?

44:50.858 --> 44:53.443
<i>Yes, mother. I'm just going
to make some cocoa.</i>

44:58.031 --> 44:59.575
A puppy.

45:03.871 --> 45:06.373
- Okay.
- What can I say?

45:06.456 --> 45:10.919
I'm sorry you got stuck with me.
I'm sorry I dragged you down with me.

45:10.961 --> 45:15.424
I know I'm the bad blood.
I am the Wilhern. I know that.

45:15.465 --> 45:17.926
The curse is on me.
I am the curse.

45:17.968 --> 45:20.304
Me,. It's me, it's me I, me, me, me.

45:20.304 --> 45:24.308
Honey. Honey! I think your father
could use some cocoa too.

45:25.767 --> 45:27.227
<i>Okay mother.</i>

45:33.484 --> 45:36.570
Actually I might have
a cup too.

45:38.906 --> 45:40.240
Penelope?

46:28.413 --> 46:29.957
She's escaped.

46:31.333 --> 46:34.002
- Let's go.
- God, she's going to be coming after me.

46:34.044 --> 46:36.630
- Edward, you've got to control yourself.
- Quick!

47:08.328 --> 47:09.872
- What are you doing?
- We need help.

47:09.913 --> 47:12.207
Yes, I'd like to report
my daughter missing.

47:12.332 --> 47:14.293
Are you out of your mind?
What if they find her?

47:14.334 --> 47:16.170
For crying out loud Jessica!

48:45.092 --> 48:47.928
Okay, you know what? I can't hold it
any longer. Come with me.

48:47.970 --> 48:50.764
I have to pee and I can't leave
you alone with the phones.

48:50.764 --> 48:52.474
You know dear,
there was a time...

48:52.516 --> 48:56.478
when I might have jumped at such
an invitation, but right now I can't.

49:02.860 --> 49:04.278
- Hello
- Mum?

49:04.278 --> 49:07.072
<i>Hold the line, please.
- Mum?</i>

49:07.114 --> 49:09.700
<i>Collect call from Penelope...
- Yes, we'll accept</i>

49:09.741 --> 49:11.702
<i>- Mum?
Go ahead with your call, please.</i>

49:11.743 --> 49:12.744
Hello...

49:12.786 --> 49:15.205
<i>Penelope, what the hell
were you thinking?</i>

49:15.247 --> 49:17.499
<i>- Did anyone see you yet?
No... Mum, no</i>

49:17.541 --> 49:19.918
Good, good. Where are you?
We'll come and get you.

49:19.960 --> 49:24.715
<i>I'm just calling to say that
I love you, and... goodbye.</i>

49:25.465 --> 49:27.134
<i>Penelope don't...</i>

49:33.390 --> 49:36.310
At least we know
she's alright.

49:38.187 --> 49:41.940
- Don't you have to pee or something?
- No, dear, that was you.

50:16.683 --> 50:18.936
I can check you in over here.

50:23.106 --> 50:24.191
Hi...

50:24.191 --> 50:26.777
can I have a room, please?

50:26.985 --> 50:30.322
Shouldn't be a problem.
Room 8 is available.

50:30.364 --> 50:33.367
- Thank you.
- You don't want the room?

50:35.118 --> 50:36.870
No, I, I want the room.

50:36.870 --> 50:40.207
Then would you mind coming
back here so I can check you in?

50:43.252 --> 50:46.380
Thank you.
And how will you be paying for your room?

50:50.968 --> 50:52.636
Thank you, Jessica

51:37.264 --> 51:40.684
Okay, that's it for me, folks.
New dealer coming in.

51:54.573 --> 51:59.870
Erm, nostrils are bigger.
More... more piggy.

52:00.537 --> 52:03.540
Hey, hey. Guys, guys, come on.
We've got to wrap this up.

52:03.582 --> 52:06.251
I've got a deadline here.
We've got to go to print.

52:06.376 --> 52:09.379
- Crosser, crosser...
- Freakir Mona Lisa come on...

52:14.718 --> 52:17.638
- Your morning paper, madam.
- Oh, thanks, Jake.

52:18.889 --> 52:20.641
Holy magda! Aaaah!

52:25.229 --> 52:28.232
- Damn it, Edward!
- Dad, they all think I'm crazy.

52:28.273 --> 52:30.567
And this helps you?
How?

52:31.485 --> 52:35.239
You told me...
I thought this would prove...

52:36.824 --> 52:38.784
Try to remember I'm your son.

52:38.826 --> 52:41.995
That's exactly what
I'm trying to forget.

53:09.439 --> 53:11.733
Thank you, ma'am.
Gentlemen.

53:18.532 --> 53:21.326
So, how's everybody doing this fine day?

53:21.869 --> 53:23.162
I thought you
went home.

53:23.203 --> 53:27.040
I did. Slept for eight blissful hours,
fixed the kids breakfast,

53:27.040 --> 53:32.379
kissed the wife goodbye, and, according
to the button, it's your blind.

53:36.550 --> 53:38.635
You want to take your blind?

53:40.637 --> 53:42.472
Are you in or out?

53:42.472 --> 53:44.808
Hey, he's still
got chips. He's in.

54:02.075 --> 54:05.662
Just give him some time.
He's in. He'll come around.

54:11.502 --> 54:14.171
Yeah, I'll take another.
Make it a large one.

54:14.213 --> 54:16.673
Hey, he's still got chips.
He's in

54:48.622 --> 54:51.124
For starters, I'm going to need
a recent photograph.

54:51.124 --> 54:53.377
- No photographs.
- None whatsoever?

54:53.418 --> 54:56.004
No. The er... fire got them.

54:57.381 --> 54:59.883
OK,
a detailed description.

55:01.718 --> 55:04.763
Brown hair.

55:06.557 --> 55:09.059
Brown eyes.

55:11.019 --> 55:14.064
A unique... ly pleasant
personality.

55:14.064 --> 55:15.732
Think pig.

55:16.150 --> 55:18.569
- So she's a fat girl?
- Not exactly.

55:18.610 --> 55:20.904
Jessica!
Not in front of company.

55:20.904 --> 55:22.990
Don't be silly.
He knows I didn't mean it.

55:23.031 --> 55:24.575
That's not true, madam.

55:24.616 --> 55:27.828
I may not have said anything,
but I was filing it away.

55:27.911 --> 55:29.872
So she's not exactly fat?

55:29.913 --> 55:33.542
Does any of this really matter?
Just go find her!

55:33.584 --> 55:37.171
Our daughter's out there somewhere,
lost and afraid

55:52.102 --> 55:54.271
You haven't given me anything to go on.

55:54.313 --> 55:57.483
No photographs, no friends,
no job, no hangouts...

55:57.524 --> 56:00.486
It's something like this,
but minus the fangs.

56:00.527 --> 56:03.447
- Franklin!
- Do you want to find her or not?

56:03.989 --> 56:05.782
Minus the fangs.

56:06.783 --> 56:09.119
They're certainly eye-grabbing.

56:09.620 --> 56:11.371
Jake, purse.

56:14.416 --> 56:17.961
OK, you know what? Never mind.
How much do we owe you?

56:18.378 --> 56:20.130
Where's my...?

56:20.672 --> 56:22.883
Who took my wallet?!

56:47.991 --> 56:52.246
It's our daughter. Please help us.
Please, I'm begging you.

56:52.579 --> 56:55.833
What he's trying to say is,
give us the key now!

56:55.833 --> 56:57.084
I'm sorry, but...

56:57.084 --> 56:59.419
The room is registered
in my name with my...

56:59.461 --> 57:01.755
Who's the guest? Me.
That makes me the guest.

57:06.760 --> 57:10.931
You two go on ahead.
Not real big on the fang thing.

57:18.355 --> 57:21.775
Well, at least we know
she's not starving.

57:49.303 --> 57:52.639
No, not... not just... not just any pig.

57:53.473 --> 57:56.602
You need to stop talking now.

57:58.896 --> 58:00.230
Hello?

58:01.315 --> 58:02.858
Yeah, that's right...

58:06.320 --> 58:08.489
- Penelope?
- Who is this?

58:11.492 --> 58:13.494
That was Penelope on the...

58:16.413 --> 58:18.499
Sell her own picture?

58:19.958 --> 58:23.921
Er... then why did you hang up?

58:24.546 --> 58:27.466
Edward, what's... what's wrong with you?
Did you ever...?

58:38.185 --> 58:39.561
How did you know it was me?

58:39.603 --> 58:42.689
<i>Just a lucky guess. You have
something you want to sell us?</i>

58:42.731 --> 58:44.024
That's right.

58:44.149 --> 58:45.901
May I ask
why you are doing this?

58:45.943 --> 58:48.612
<i>What do you care?
You're getting a freak.</i>

58:48.654 --> 58:51.198
Hey, nobody said anything
about a freak.

58:51.240 --> 58:54.159
<i>- Listen, do you want it or not?
- Sure. Yes.</i>

58:54.785 --> 58:57.287
Yes. Yes, I do. Thank you.

59:31.697 --> 59:34.825
- Look, Grandma, a pig!
- How nice.

01:00:33.550 --> 01:00:34.801
Fangs?

01:00:36.970 --> 01:00:38.972
There are no fangs.

01:00:43.310 --> 01:00:47.481
Well, she must just suck them back
Edward, you know, I've been thinking.

01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:52.569
I know and you know.
Maybe that's enough.

01:00:52.611 --> 01:00:56.907
Lemon, half the people in this
city think I'm crazy.

01:00:58.033 --> 01:01:01.078
I've got to prove to them
that I'm not.

01:01:01.245 --> 01:01:04.081
I'm sorry.
I've got to do it.

01:01:06.250 --> 01:01:08.252
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:12.005
I give you
the pig-faced girl.

01:01:12.047 --> 01:01:14.091
You see? I'm not crazy.

01:01:14.174 --> 01:01:17.845
Am I crazy? You, am I crazy?
I'm not crazy.

01:01:32.109 --> 01:01:34.194
You weren't kidding!

01:01:46.206 --> 01:01:47.875
Can I get you something?

01:01:48.083 --> 01:01:50.460
Can I have a beer on tap,
please?

01:01:50.502 --> 01:01:52.462
Sure. You can have this one.

01:01:53.922 --> 01:01:55.465
Coming right up.

01:01:58.635 --> 01:02:01.430
- You're supposed to catch it.
- Oh, sorry.

01:02:04.892 --> 01:02:06.727
Are you ready now?

01:02:08.228 --> 01:02:10.314
- There you go.
- Thank you.

01:02:15.194 --> 01:02:16.653
Is there a problem?

01:02:18.405 --> 01:02:20.199
- Do you have any straws?
- Sure.

01:02:24.077 --> 01:02:25.329
There you go.

01:02:39.676 --> 01:02:40.844
That's half of what you gave me.

01:02:40.886 --> 01:02:43.347
You'll get the rest back
when I'm ready.

01:02:43.388 --> 01:02:45.849
- Let's just call it even.
- No, let's not.

01:02:46.058 --> 01:02:47.768
She's not some
freaking pay day.

01:02:47.810 --> 01:02:49.520
She sold me the photo herself.

01:02:50.437 --> 01:02:53.857
Yeah. Apparently, she's...
out there on her own,

01:02:54.691 --> 01:02:56.902
declaring her independence.

01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:24.638
- Hey there, Jack.
- Annie!

01:03:24.721 --> 01:03:27.224
Lucky you, last
delivery of the day.

01:03:27.474 --> 01:03:28.559
How are you doing?

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:29.309
Are you sure you really want to know,
or are you just asking?

01:03:30.978 --> 01:03:33.355
- I'm just asking.
- So I'm driving my Vespa,

01:03:33.397 --> 01:03:36.275
and this guy comes out of nowhere
and hits me. I go flying.

01:03:36.316 --> 01:03:39.153
I'm in the street and he's stands over
me and he's, like,

01:03:39.153 --> 01:03:40.779
'I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't see.

01:03:40.821 --> 01:03:44.158
How can he not see me, you know?
I'm on a Vespa with wings.

01:03:44.158 --> 01:03:47.244
I mean, right, you can see me.
You can see me, right?

01:03:47.786 --> 01:03:49.163
What?

01:03:49.246 --> 01:03:51.540
See? She can see me.

01:03:52.666 --> 01:03:55.043
You ought to sic Billy on him.

01:03:55.085 --> 01:03:57.796
Yeah, it's a little too late.
You've got to sign here.

01:03:57.838 --> 01:04:02.509
- Billy moved back to the burbs.
- Yeah? Sorry to hear it.

01:04:02.509 --> 01:04:05.179
Yeah. We had no business being together.
He was a picket fence kind of guy.

01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:07.681
And, like, what guy looks at me
and thinks picket fence.

01:04:07.681 --> 01:04:11.977
Unless he's crazy, and I'm done
dating crazy, you know? Done.

01:04:12.186 --> 01:04:13.937
Unless it's meant to be.
Right?

01:04:13.979 --> 01:04:14.897
Yeah. Right.

01:04:15.022 --> 01:04:16.773
- Right?
- Right.

01:04:16.982 --> 01:04:20.027
I can't hear you with that
thing on your face.

01:04:22.196 --> 01:04:24.573
The usual.
On the house.

01:04:24.615 --> 01:04:26.992
Thanks, Jack.
You're the best.

01:04:27.034 --> 01:04:28.243
Cheers.

01:04:36.585 --> 01:04:40.130
So, what? Are you hiding from the law,
or is that a bad nose job?

01:04:40.172 --> 01:04:42.216
Mm-hm. Bad nose job.

01:04:45.052 --> 01:04:49.389
Do you mind me asking how much that
might cost somebody, like a nose job?

01:04:49.515 --> 01:04:51.600
- Oh, nothing.
- Free?

01:04:54.394 --> 01:04:58.065
I was just thinking maybe... getting a
little work done myself.

01:04:58.106 --> 01:04:59.817
A nose job?

01:04:59.817 --> 01:05:02.861
Yeah, kind of, but for like
for my ears, you know?

01:05:02.986 --> 01:05:06.740
They just, stick out up here a little on
the top. I mean, I'm no Penelope, but...

01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:10.244
No, you have beautiful ears.
Beautiful. They're beautiful.

01:05:10.285 --> 01:05:12.454
- What, are you drunk?
- I'm drunk.

01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:17.251
Hey, Jack, how about another round
for my pal, Scarfy, here?

01:05:17.292 --> 01:05:18.418
Coming up.

01:05:20.587 --> 01:05:22.673
What's a Vespa?

01:05:22.756 --> 01:05:25.676
What's a V...? You've never
ridden on a Vespa?

01:05:28.428 --> 01:05:31.932
- Hey, Sam, long time no see.
- Wow, look who's back.

01:05:33.433 --> 01:05:36.228
Look... have you seen the guys around?

01:05:36.270 --> 01:05:39.690
They're touring, opening for some
band who's supposed to be good.

01:05:39.731 --> 01:05:43.110
- No kidding? That's... that's great.
- What brings you back here?

01:05:43.152 --> 01:05:45.821
Oh, you know...
looking around.

01:05:46.113 --> 01:05:49.449
Actually, I thought it was maybe time
I started playing again.

01:05:49.491 --> 01:05:51.368
Yeah? Well, good luck with that, eh?

01:05:52.202 --> 01:05:54.663
Look, come on, Sam,
I wouldn't even ask if...

01:05:54.705 --> 01:05:58.625
You are joking, ain't you?
After all your no-shows?

01:05:58.667 --> 01:06:00.961
I only look stupid.

01:06:01.378 --> 01:06:05.632
Look, I messed up.
know, and I'm sorry.

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:10.220
Let's just say I didn't appreciate
a good thing when I had it.

01:06:10.262 --> 01:06:13.348
- Oh, and now you do?
- Now I do.

01:06:26.904 --> 01:06:29.072
Still got your scarf on.

01:06:32.242 --> 01:06:33.660
All right, hop on.

01:07:31.885 --> 01:07:33.720
All right, I gotta go down the street.

01:07:43.147 --> 01:07:44.898
Oi! Mozart!

01:07:46.066 --> 01:07:49.153
Yeah. Listen, I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

01:07:49.194 --> 01:07:51.071
Don't muck about.

01:08:03.584 --> 01:08:05.836
You can take your whole face off.
My brother once was like,

01:08:05.836 --> 01:08:09.923
he was just riding his bicycle,
and he hit this, like, parked car,

01:08:09.965 --> 01:08:12.092
and he was so freaked out about
seeing his teeth in the hood,

01:08:12.134 --> 01:08:13.760
and, like, his whole face was bleeding

01:08:13.802 --> 01:08:17.221
then he got back on the bicycle
and he went to the movies...

01:08:18.682 --> 01:08:20.850
Look!
Helleborus orientalis.

01:08:20.850 --> 01:08:24.104
They're amazing.
They bloom even in the winter.

01:08:24.145 --> 01:08:25.229
Oh, that's cool.

01:08:25.272 --> 01:08:28.274
They just pop up without
any help from anyone.

01:08:29.109 --> 01:08:32.237
That's like my ex-boyfriend,
if you know what I mean.

01:08:34.448 --> 01:08:36.283
You know what I mean, right?

01:08:37.117 --> 01:08:38.702
Really?

01:08:39.953 --> 01:08:42.538
You don't get out much, do you?

01:08:43.290 --> 01:08:45.167
We should talk.

01:08:45.876 --> 01:08:48.045
- Another postcard.
- I don't care.

01:08:48.086 --> 01:08:50.171
- What's it say?
Went ice skating.

01:08:50.214 --> 01:08:51.715
Stop. I don't care.

01:08:51.715 --> 01:08:53.800
- Circus.
- It's been months.

01:08:54.343 --> 01:08:55.469
Zoo.

01:08:55.511 --> 01:08:58.514
How could she be doing all these
things without being seen?

01:08:58.555 --> 01:09:00.390
She can't! That's how.

01:09:01.642 --> 01:09:03.935
Oh, honey, what are we going to do?

01:09:10.317 --> 01:09:12.694
That's her scarf! Look.

01:09:32.296 --> 01:09:33.756
No, she went that...

01:09:44.184 --> 01:09:46.185
This is really good.

01:09:46.185 --> 01:09:49.106
Oh, great. You're here.
It's your turn to buy.

01:09:49.523 --> 01:09:51.608
All right, I lied.
I'll buy.

01:09:51.899 --> 01:09:53.277
Oh, my God!

01:09:55.237 --> 01:09:58.157
Somebody pull this scarf off her.
She can't breathe.

01:10:38.489 --> 01:10:40.574
They're not running.

01:10:44.745 --> 01:10:48.081
Ah! No! Penelope, no!
No, no, no, dear! Turn away!

01:10:50.167 --> 01:10:51.752
She's coming out!

01:10:52.794 --> 01:10:54.588
There she is!

01:10:54.671 --> 01:10:58.509
Penelope, this way!
This way, Penelope!

01:10:59.593 --> 01:11:02.513
Is it true you were
chained up in the basement?

01:11:03.096 --> 01:11:04.348
Don't encourage them.

01:11:04.389 --> 01:11:07.267
Penelope, do you have
any other pig parts?

01:11:07.392 --> 01:11:10.312
With such a large nose, do you smell
better than the rest of us?

01:11:10.354 --> 01:11:12.189
I don't know. You tell me.

01:11:16.902 --> 01:11:18.654
Mom, can I borrow some money?
I'm running low.

01:11:18.695 --> 01:11:21.156
Absolutely not.
You get in that car.

01:11:21.865 --> 01:11:25.619
Mom, they want to know if you
chained me up in the basement.

01:11:26.578 --> 01:11:30.624
Like, after three weeks, I was like,
I knew something was up.

01:11:30.666 --> 01:11:32.292
Nose jobs only take
so long, you know.

01:11:32.334 --> 01:11:34.503
No, of course not.

01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:37.214
- Bye, darling.
- Bye.

01:11:37.422 --> 01:11:38.549
Let it go, dear.

01:11:38.590 --> 01:11:41.051
Penelope, is there anything
you'd like to say to the public?

01:11:41.927 --> 01:11:43.053
Er... hi.

01:12:08.579 --> 01:12:10.372
Mr Vanderman!

01:12:11.123 --> 01:12:13.709
Is it true you attempted to file
assault charges against Penelope?

01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:15.169
I've obtained
the police report.

01:12:15.210 --> 01:12:16.920
No comment, please.
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:12:16.962 --> 01:12:18.380
It's OK.
I can handle it.

01:12:18.422 --> 01:12:22.593
That woman, that thing,
belongs in a cage.

01:12:24.553 --> 01:12:26.847
- What a creep.
- Excuse me.

01:12:31.435 --> 01:12:33.020
Have you lost your mind?

01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:35.606
You saw her.
She's a complete monster.

01:12:35.647 --> 01:12:37.774
The public loves this girl.

01:12:37.816 --> 01:12:40.819
- They don't know her like I do.
- We're a publicly traded company.

01:12:40.861 --> 01:12:43.614
We love what the public loves.
Get it?

01:12:46.116 --> 01:12:47.784
So, what are you saying?

01:12:47.784 --> 01:12:50.621
I'm saying you've got
to fix this.

01:12:50.829 --> 01:12:52.080
I don't know what you
expect me to do.

01:12:52.122 --> 01:12:54.374
Just fix it!

01:12:55.959 --> 01:12:57.920
Come on, Penelope,
you're on my team!

01:12:57.961 --> 01:12:59.796
OK, but I'm not very good.

01:13:03.050 --> 01:13:05.010
Come on, come on, come on.

01:13:14.478 --> 01:13:16.355
I told you
I wasn't very good.

01:13:19.483 --> 01:13:20.984
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:25.322
You really did it, huh?

01:13:26.281 --> 01:13:32.955
I mean, er... you look great,
you know, really happy.

01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:34.832
Thanks.

01:13:36.834 --> 01:13:38.794
Yeah. You know, you inspired me.

01:13:39.628 --> 01:13:42.339
Doing what you did, going off
on your own like that.

01:13:42.673 --> 01:13:46.009
- I er... I'm not...
- I have to go.

01:13:46.510 --> 01:13:49.221
Yeah, sure. I just...

01:13:58.063 --> 01:13:59.106
Oh, darling, I am so glad
I found you!

01:13:59.148 --> 01:14:00.774
You must come home right now!

01:14:01.191 --> 01:14:03.152
I have the most
wonderful surprise.

01:14:03.193 --> 01:14:05.070
OK, Mom, but I really
should get back.

01:14:07.906 --> 01:14:08.699
Penelope. What is this?

01:14:08.699 --> 01:14:13.412
Listen, I'm sorry I ran
from my feelings.

01:14:14.163 --> 01:14:15.622
Oh, is that what you were running from?

01:14:15.622 --> 01:14:18.542
I was certain you were
running from me.

01:14:18.542 --> 01:14:20.586
Only my feelings
for you.

01:14:20.627 --> 01:14:24.131
- Is this a joke?
- Penelope, don't make the boy beg.

01:14:24.173 --> 01:14:26.717
Look at that face.
He can break the curse.

01:14:26.758 --> 01:14:29.261
But things are different now,
Mother. I...

01:14:29.303 --> 01:14:30.846
She's overwhelmed.

01:14:32.181 --> 01:14:35.100
Why? Because you're splattered
all over the newspapers?

01:14:35.142 --> 01:14:36.852
No, because I have friends.

01:14:36.894 --> 01:14:39.062
Those aren't friends, dear.
Those are fans.

01:14:39.104 --> 01:14:41.273
'Did you hear?
The pig speaks ten languages.'

01:14:41.273 --> 01:14:43.942
'Oh, look,
the pig can play the piano.'

01:14:44.067 --> 01:14:48.447
You're just a talking pig to
those people. A talking pig.

01:14:50.115 --> 01:14:53.243
Edward wants to marry you.

01:14:56.371 --> 01:15:00.250
Are you prepared to walk away from
your one and only chance?

01:15:00.250 --> 01:15:03.587
Our one and only chance
at a normal life?

01:15:13.138 --> 01:15:15.849
Will you marry me, Penelope?

01:15:29.738 --> 01:15:31.114
Hey, Lemon.

01:15:31.406 --> 01:15:36.829
I thought you might be able to help me
with this Max Campion story I'm doing.

01:15:37.371 --> 01:15:39.456
Well, what's the story?

01:15:39.456 --> 01:15:43.710
I'm doing this kind of riches to rags
to armed robbery story.

01:15:43.752 --> 01:15:45.921
Armed robbery?
Come on? Max Campion?

01:15:45.921 --> 01:15:49.132
Yeah. I just got the call.
He's already confessed.

01:15:51.218 --> 01:15:52.678
What?

01:16:02.688 --> 01:16:03.939
Pick it up.

01:16:07.276 --> 01:16:08.694
<i>You the lawyer
my mother sent?</i>

01:16:08.735 --> 01:16:11.446
<i>There's been a mistake.
I'm here to see Max Campion.</i>

01:16:11.488 --> 01:16:13.073
Yeah, hey, I'm Max Campion.

01:16:13.115 --> 01:16:15.492
<i>- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.</i>

01:16:15.534 --> 01:16:17.202
<i>No, Max Campion.</i>

01:16:17.202 --> 01:16:20.747
<i>I am not deaf. I can hear you.
I am Max Campion.</i>

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.376
<i>But you're...</i>

01:16:37.598 --> 01:16:42.311
<i>What about the guy
you play poker with?</i>

01:16:43.353 --> 01:16:48.025
<i>Shaggy hair,
er... medium build.</i>

01:16:48.150 --> 01:16:50.027
Doesn't know when to quit.

01:16:51.069 --> 01:16:53.238
<i>Ah! Er... is Johnny Martin.
- Johnny Martin?</i>

01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:55.866
Johnny Martin.
Poor loser.

01:16:55.949 --> 01:16:59.620
<i>Get that down, Martin, in the
pirate pad there</i>

01:17:04.124 --> 01:17:05.751
Do you have...? Hey, don't!

01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:25.687
Oh, that was so wonderful.
Was it not wonderful?

01:17:25.729 --> 01:17:27.356
Yes, wonderful.

01:17:28.398 --> 01:17:30.025
We have to do this again.

01:17:30.067 --> 01:17:31.819
Now that we're
nearly family,

01:17:31.819 --> 01:17:33.695
I think this is just the beginning.

01:17:33.737 --> 01:17:35.697
- Yes. I'll fetch the limo.
- Good, good, good.

01:17:37.366 --> 01:17:39.451
Can I have my coat,
please?

01:17:39.576 --> 01:17:42.913
Oh, Franklin, we used to go out to the
theatre all the time. Why did we stop?

01:17:42.913 --> 01:17:45.374
I guess because we had an ugly daughter.

01:17:45.415 --> 01:17:47.793
It's true, Jessica.
We gave up everything

01:17:48.418 --> 01:17:50.420
because we had an ugly daughter.

01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:53.632
- Let me help you with that, sir.
- Thank you.

01:17:54.675 --> 01:17:56.969
- It's just over there.
- OK, we're going.

01:17:57.511 --> 01:17:59.930
- But my coat!
- Fine, we'll get you another one.

01:17:59.972 --> 01:18:02.391
Edward, what are you doing?
Where are we going?

01:18:02.599 --> 01:18:05.519
- Max.
- Hello, Penelope.

01:18:06.228 --> 01:18:07.729
We were just leaving.

01:18:07.729 --> 01:18:10.524
- Hey, how are things, Edward?
- Keep walking.

01:18:11.441 --> 01:18:14.278
I understand it got a bit grotesque
there for a while,

01:18:14.319 --> 01:18:15.279
even puke ugly.

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:17.823
- But... You two know each other?
- As a matter of fact, we do.

01:18:17.865 --> 01:18:19.283
Yale, wasn't it?

01:18:19.491 --> 01:18:22.703
No, I believe it was a Bedford,
a Bedford van to be...

01:18:22.744 --> 01:18:26.039
Stop!
Haven't you hurt her enough?

01:18:26.290 --> 01:18:28.250
- Bathroom. Now.
- Edward, I...

01:18:28.375 --> 01:18:31.378
- Why don't you let Edward handle this?
- But, Mother...

01:18:31.461 --> 01:18:32.504
You make me sick!

01:18:32.546 --> 01:18:36.717
Why? I'm giving her exactly
what she wants.

01:18:36.925 --> 01:18:39.928
And I don't see anybody else
lining up to do that.

01:18:39.970 --> 01:18:42.806
Oh, unless... unless you are.
Are you lining up?

01:18:42.848 --> 01:18:45.350
- That's not the point.
- Yeah, it is. Yes, it is the point!

01:18:46.727 --> 01:18:49.104
Look, if you want to go out there

01:18:49.146 --> 01:18:51.899
and tell her that the only man willing
to stand up and say, 'I do,'

01:18:52.024 --> 01:18:56.820
still gags at the thought of kissing her,
then be my guest,

01:18:57.863 --> 01:19:00.240
but it's not me
you'll be hurting.

01:19:01.408 --> 01:19:03.827
It's her, isn't it?

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:18.509
Johnny Martin.

01:19:20.719 --> 01:19:24.348
- Son of a plumber, huh?
- It sure took you long enough.

01:19:25.808 --> 01:19:28.018
Boy, you sure fooled me.

01:19:35.526 --> 01:19:39.780
So, it looks like you were
doing her a favour after all.

01:19:40.948 --> 01:19:43.742
- You seen this?
- Hmm. Cute couple.

01:19:44.159 --> 01:19:46.328
Yeah. Penelope and the beast.

01:19:46.453 --> 01:19:49.164
Hey, they're both getting
what they want, right?

01:19:49.206 --> 01:19:51.750
I know what he's getting.
What's she getting?

01:19:51.792 --> 01:19:55.128
Well, she's getting the day
she's waited for all her life,

01:19:55.128 --> 01:19:57.089
breaking the curse.

01:19:57.923 --> 01:20:00.551
Oh, you don't actually believe that,
do you?

01:20:00.717 --> 01:20:02.511
Well, don't you?

01:20:02.803 --> 01:20:06.056
What the hell have you been
chasing all these years?

01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:09.893
I don't know. A wounded ego
and a missing eye, I guess.

01:20:09.935 --> 01:20:11.979
Come on, a curse?

01:20:12.729 --> 01:20:16.483
Yeah. Who knows? You know, you spend
enough time around a poker table,

01:20:16.525 --> 01:20:19.194
you believe in all sorts of things.

01:20:19.236 --> 01:20:21.905
Hey, it's not too late
to stop Edward.

01:20:21.947 --> 01:20:23.657
That's what she wants.

01:20:24.199 --> 01:20:28.495
Wait. If getting married is all it takes
to break the 'ooh, the curse,'...

01:20:28.495 --> 01:20:29.788
why not you?

01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:32.666
- You're forgetting, man. I'm not Max.
- So?

01:20:33.584 --> 01:20:36.003
'One of their own kind'.

01:20:59.109 --> 01:21:02.571
Hey! Over here!
I saved you a seat! It's clean.

01:21:02.613 --> 01:21:04.656
Hey, Annie, look at you.

01:21:09.453 --> 01:21:11.622
Weddings are great, aren't they?

01:21:11.747 --> 01:21:14.374
Yeah. When they're
somebody else's.

01:21:14.374 --> 01:21:15.626
Jessica,
I need a word.

01:21:15.626 --> 01:21:16.210
Excuse me.

01:21:16.210 --> 01:21:18.420
What's the matter? Is there a problem?

01:21:20.506 --> 01:21:23.008
And Edward seems
really nice.

01:21:23.133 --> 01:21:24.968
Mom, I think I'm going to throw up.

01:21:25.010 --> 01:21:26.970
Just remember,
in a few minutes from now,

01:21:27.012 --> 01:21:29.556
the curse will be broken.

01:21:29.890 --> 01:21:33.727
There is no curse. The only one
cursed here is me.

01:21:40.734 --> 01:21:44.071
- For starters...
- Losing your eye was your own damn fault.

01:21:44.112 --> 01:21:46.365
- Now what?
- I just wanted to apologise.

01:21:46.406 --> 01:21:48.242
Apology not accepted.

01:21:49.368 --> 01:21:52.496
What?!
I have a wedding to go to!

01:21:53.330 --> 01:21:55.249
Meet Johnny Martin.

01:22:00.254 --> 01:22:02.631
I told you not to rush
the process.

01:22:02.673 --> 01:22:04.508
This doesn't change a thing.

01:22:04.591 --> 01:22:07.302
How can you say that?
Not only was Edward part of...

01:22:07.344 --> 01:22:10.514
As you yourself once said,
he's still one of our own kind.

01:22:10.556 --> 01:22:13.684
OK, fine. What about Max, or Johnny
or whatever his name is?

01:22:13.725 --> 01:22:14.268
What about him?

01:22:14.309 --> 01:22:16.603
Don't you think Penelope's
entitled to know?

01:22:16.645 --> 01:22:17.729
That he lied about everything?

01:22:17.771 --> 01:22:20.440
That he doesn't have the
power to break the curse.

01:22:20.482 --> 01:22:22.734
Why on earth would
she need to know that?

01:22:22.734 --> 01:22:26.530
Don't you see? Maybe that's
the only reason he said no.

01:22:26.905 --> 01:22:29.741
I don't know that. You don't know that.
But if that's true,

01:22:29.783 --> 01:22:32.786
God bless him,
he did the right thing.

01:22:33.287 --> 01:22:36.957
- Damn it, Jessica, I can't just...
- Leave it alone.

01:22:38.083 --> 01:22:40.711
Not that I'm not happy for her.
I'm really happy for her.

01:22:40.711 --> 01:22:41.920
You're happy for her, right?

01:22:41.962 --> 01:22:44.423
- If she's happy, I'm happy.
- Right.

01:22:44.464 --> 01:22:47.468
- Mom, I feel stupid.
- Oh, you don't look stupid.

01:22:47.509 --> 01:22:48.510
You look...

01:22:49.636 --> 01:22:52.055
You don't look stupid.

01:23:09.781 --> 01:23:12.409
<i>Do you, Edward Vanderman
take Penelope Wilher</i>

01:23:12.409 --> 01:23:15.412
<i>to be your lawfully wedded wife?</i>

01:23:16.163 --> 01:23:20.000
<i>To have and to hold,</i>

01:23:20.834 --> 01:23:23.754
for better or for worse
for richer or for poorer

01:23:23.795 --> 01:23:26.256
in sickness and in health.

01:23:26.799 --> 01:23:30.844
To love and to cherish
from this day forward

01:23:31.678 --> 01:23:34.181
until death do you part?

01:23:37.434 --> 01:23:38.560
I do.

01:23:41.396 --> 01:23:44.066
And do you, Penelope Wilhern,

01:23:44.942 --> 01:23:47.861
take Edward Humphrey
Vanderman III

01:23:48.028 --> 01:23:50.781
to be your lawfully wedded husband,

01:23:51.490 --> 01:23:56.578
to have and to hold,
for better or for worse

01:23:57.204 --> 01:24:01.291
for richer or for poorer,
in sickness and in health,

01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:06.088
to love and to cherish
from this day forward

01:24:06.129 --> 01:24:08.590
until death do you part?

01:24:35.701 --> 01:24:38.203
Nobody move!
She's fine!

01:24:41.248 --> 01:24:44.251
Penelope, wait!
Penelope! Stop!

01:24:45.586 --> 01:24:47.379
Look at me.

01:24:47.421 --> 01:24:48.714
I am.
What is it, dear?

01:24:48.755 --> 01:24:50.215
No, look at me.

01:24:50.215 --> 01:24:53.927
I am! What?
I don't understand! What do you mean?

01:24:55.512 --> 01:24:57.681
You... I'm sorry.

01:25:02.394 --> 01:25:05.022
Penelope, it's not too late.

01:25:05.105 --> 01:25:06.315
Go away, Mother!

01:25:06.356 --> 01:25:08.317
<i>Honey, just think about
what you're doing.</i>

01:25:08.358 --> 01:25:11.069
<i>This is the moment
we have worked so hard for.</i>

01:25:11.069 --> 01:25:12.779
I said go away!

01:25:12.821 --> 01:25:15.616
Sweetheart, please! Please!

01:25:15.616 --> 01:25:18.785
We are one yes away
from a whole new life.

01:25:18.952 --> 01:25:20.412
A whole new you!

01:25:20.454 --> 01:25:22.706
But I don't want a whole new me,
Mother!

01:25:22.748 --> 01:25:25.209
Sweetheart, please! Please!

01:25:25.667 --> 01:25:28.462
I like myself the way I am.

01:26:55.841 --> 01:26:58.135
It's not going to grow back.

01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:01.889
- What makes you think I...
- I miss it too.

01:27:02.306 --> 01:27:05.142
And then I remember
you're still you.

01:27:13.984 --> 01:27:15.235
Oh, Penelope...

01:27:16.695 --> 01:27:19.740
'One of your own kind.'
I just assumed...

01:27:20.574 --> 01:27:22.284
No, we all did, Mother.

01:27:22.326 --> 01:27:24.578
No, dear.
No. Don't you see?

01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:27.122
I could have broken
the curse years ago

01:27:27.164 --> 01:27:29.625
if I'd just done my job
as your mother,

01:27:29.666 --> 01:27:31.710
and loved you as my own.

01:27:31.752 --> 01:27:34.213
You didn't know.
You didn't know.

01:27:50.270 --> 01:27:51.522
Oh, look.

01:27:53.106 --> 01:27:56.401
You know, darling, with the
carotid artery out of the way,

01:27:56.735 --> 01:28:01.532
I think a little turn up might,
right there, be sweet. Look at that.

01:28:01.615 --> 01:28:04.660
What?
You're crazy.

01:28:07.287 --> 01:28:10.999
Oh, it's wrong for a young woman
to want to look her best?

01:28:11.041 --> 01:28:12.793
That's not a bad thing...

01:28:12.876 --> 01:28:15.045
What?
I'm being her mother.

01:28:15.087 --> 01:28:17.589
That's what mothers do
with daughters!

01:28:17.631 --> 01:28:19.967
They talk about how
to look prettier.

01:28:19.967 --> 01:28:22.469
<i>Still, I felt sad
for my mother that day...</i>

01:28:22.469 --> 01:28:25.139
Why are you turning it around?
Oh, now I'm the bad guy!

01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:27.808
<i>... having to cope with so many
changes all at once.</i>

01:28:27.850 --> 01:28:29.810
It all went back to shit!

01:28:29.852 --> 01:28:31.645
<i>I was packing to go,</i>

01:28:31.645 --> 01:28:35.107
and after 25 years
with the family...

01:28:35.149 --> 01:28:38.318
Jake, where are you going?
Jake, I'm talking to you. Jake?

01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:40.946
And why do you have that bag?
Jake! Don't be rude!

01:28:40.988 --> 01:28:43.574
You turn around when
I'm talking to you, please.

01:28:43.574 --> 01:28:45.325
I happen to be...

01:28:57.754 --> 01:29:01.675
There, there, now. There, there.

01:29:32.956 --> 01:29:37.044
<i>But I had my own changes
to cope with,</i>

01:29:38.212 --> 01:29:40.047
<i>and, while I missed the face</i>

01:29:40.088 --> 01:29:41.715
<i>that had caused
so much trouble...</i>

01:29:44.968 --> 01:29:47.888
<i>... the world had
moved on.</i>

01:29:50.891 --> 01:29:54.478
<i>... and I was determined
to find my own way,</i>

01:29:55.604 --> 01:29:58.649
<i>and determined to always
follow my heart...</i>

01:29:58.649 --> 01:30:00.734
Look! My daffodil bloomed!

01:30:00.734 --> 01:30:03.737
And I found
Helleborus orientalis!

01:30:04.655 --> 01:30:06.448
<i>... and my conscience.</i>

01:30:07.991 --> 01:30:11.328
<i>Dear Edward, that first
day in the library,</i>

01:30:11.370 --> 01:30:15.374
<i>you said that you too have felt
imprisoned most of your life.</i>

01:30:15.415 --> 01:30:19.378
<i>Looking back, I now believe you
were speaking from your heart.</i>

01:30:19.419 --> 01:30:22.381
<i>I fear I did you a terrible
disservice that day</i>

01:30:22.422 --> 01:30:25.509
<i>I knew you would run
I wanted you to,</i>

01:30:25.509 --> 01:30:29.513
<i>but perhaps if I had taken
the time to really listen to you,</i>

01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:32.599
<i>maybe we could have helped
each other find our way.</i>

01:30:32.599 --> 01:30:37.521
<i>I'm sorry. I hope this letter
and this ring finds you well.</i>

01:30:45.112 --> 01:30:50.033
Edward? Edward? Your father wants
to know what you're doing in there.

01:30:53.162 --> 01:30:54.997
<i>And then came Halloween.</i>

01:30:55.038 --> 01:30:56.373
Okay, everybody. We're going to start
in about ten minutes, so I need you

01:30:56.415 --> 01:30:58.292
all to go and get your costumes on. OK?

01:30:59.209 --> 01:31:03.797
Just get changed and line up
by the front door as quick as possible.

01:31:04.089 --> 01:31:06.091
Hey! Hey! No fighting.

01:31:06.175 --> 01:31:09.178
- I can be whoever I want!
- Girls, please.

01:31:09.219 --> 01:31:12.139
But she knew I was
going to be Penelope.

01:31:14.558 --> 01:31:18.896
All right, girls, you're going to have to
go out with the rest of the class.

01:31:18.937 --> 01:31:22.900
Go and line up. Come on, line up.
Get ready to go. Come on.

01:31:24.026 --> 01:31:26.820
Alice?
Honey, what's wrong?

01:31:27.070 --> 01:31:31.283
Everybody's Penelope,
and I'm a stupid static cling!

01:31:31.325 --> 01:31:35.496
Oh... Well, frankly,
I find you quite refreshing.

01:31:35.913 --> 01:31:40.000
Come on, sweetie. Stick with me
and we'll both make it through this.

01:31:42.669 --> 01:31:45.005
Trick or treat!

01:31:45.005 --> 01:31:46.423
Well, hello there.

01:31:47.382 --> 01:31:51.345
- I love this one. These are my favourites.
- Jess, you're going to want to see this.

01:31:51.553 --> 01:31:53.639
Is this too much?

01:31:57.392 --> 01:31:58.852
Bye.

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:10.447
<i>And then Wanda couldn't hold on
to the secret any longer.</i>

01:32:35.556 --> 01:32:40.060
You're everywhere.
Are you freaking out or what?

01:32:41.186 --> 01:32:43.897
- OK, 357.
- There it is.

01:32:44.940 --> 01:32:46.316
Hold on.

01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:48.402
What?

01:32:49.236 --> 01:32:52.239
It's just kind of great
to see the old you.

01:32:52.322 --> 01:32:54.950
- OK. All right, let's go.
- All right, here we go.

01:32:56.076 --> 01:32:58.829
You can do this.
Are you ready?

01:33:07.045 --> 01:33:08.839
Hi. Um... I...

01:33:09.756 --> 01:33:14.011
She's gotta pee. You got a bathroom?
I'm going to get some punch.

01:33:16.930 --> 01:33:21.518
Er... yeah. Yeah, sure. I guess it's OK.
Come on in.

01:33:28.734 --> 01:33:30.819
<i>It looks like a good party.</i>

01:33:32.488 --> 01:33:34.448
<i>Why aren't you at the party?</i>

01:33:34.573 --> 01:33:36.366
I gotta pack.

01:33:36.366 --> 01:33:38.202
So, are you moving?

01:33:40.621 --> 01:33:45.709
Er... out-of-town job. I felt like
getting out of the city for a while.

01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:50.130
<i>Away from the crowds?</i>

01:33:50.631 --> 01:33:53.634
Yeah, the crowds
at the poker tables.

01:33:54.301 --> 01:33:56.136
Oh, so you're a gambler?

01:33:56.261 --> 01:33:59.890
Ex.
Avoiding temptation.

01:34:04.728 --> 01:34:05.854
Well, that's good.

01:34:07.314 --> 01:34:08.649
Good for you. I er...

01:34:10.234 --> 01:34:14.488
I had a friend once
who um... liked to gamble.

01:34:14.613 --> 01:34:16.865
At least, well, I heard
he liked to gamble,

01:34:16.907 --> 01:34:20.244
- And, he had to stay away from...
- Take off the mask.

01:34:21.912 --> 01:34:23.247
What?

01:34:24.832 --> 01:34:26.291
I'm sorry.

01:34:28.377 --> 01:34:30.879
All Halloween,
I've been running into...

01:34:31.004 --> 01:34:37.261
well, someone I used to know.
Sorry. Ridiculous.

01:34:41.723 --> 01:34:45.269
This someone,
she meant a lot to you?

01:34:47.563 --> 01:34:48.522
Yes.

01:34:51.316 --> 01:34:52.568
Yes, she did.

01:34:54.361 --> 01:34:55.904
What happened?

01:34:58.282 --> 01:35:01.118
I couldn't give her
what she wanted.

01:35:01.618 --> 01:35:03.412
What did she want?

01:35:07.583 --> 01:35:09.126
To be free.

01:35:10.794 --> 01:35:12.171
You shit!

01:35:12.212 --> 01:35:16.049
You lied to me!
I guessed piano, and you said...

01:35:24.475 --> 01:35:27.728
- Penelope, I'm sorry.
- I know.

01:35:27.895 --> 01:35:31.231
No. I don't have the power
to break the curse.

01:35:31.982 --> 01:35:35.527
It's OK.
It turns out that I did.

01:35:36.987 --> 01:35:38.447
It's me, Max.

01:35:40.407 --> 01:35:42.618
My name's Johnny.

01:35:43.452 --> 01:35:48.665
I know. Johnny.
I'm still me.

01:36:15.275 --> 01:36:16.944
<i>So, there we were.</i>

01:36:19.029 --> 01:36:21.615
<i>And we lived happily
ever after.</i>

01:36:23.784 --> 01:36:27.371
Well, happily ever after
so far at least.

01:36:27.538 --> 01:36:29.873
I don't get it.
What does it mean?

01:36:30.290 --> 01:36:34.211
- Well, what do you think it means?
- Rich people suck!

01:36:34.628 --> 01:36:37.047
It's always the mother's fault.

01:36:38.382 --> 01:36:40.259
We're all cursed?

01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:44.138
It's not the power of the curse,
it's the power you give the curse.

01:36:44.179 --> 01:36:47.474
- What did you say, Shrimp?
- He's not a shrimp, dummy.

01:36:47.558 --> 01:36:50.477
- He is too a shrimp!
- Hey! That's not nice!

01:36:51.311 --> 01:36:52.980
That's very good, Billy.

01:36:53.814 --> 01:36:57.401
OK, they're serving snacks
down at the picnic tables.

01:36:57.401 --> 01:36:59.570
Then, after break,
we'll go explore,

01:36:59.611 --> 01:37:01.864
and see what you can collect.

01:37:05.617 --> 01:37:07.411
Stay together.
