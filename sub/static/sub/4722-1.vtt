01:34.573 --> 01:36.741
Tina.

01:41.790 --> 01:43.707
Tina.

01:48.964 --> 01:50.714
Tina.

02:45.521 --> 02:48.190
Tina. Tina.

03:40.101 --> 03:41.394
You okay, Tina?

03:42.395 --> 03:44.023
Just a dream, Ma.

03:45.274 --> 03:47.026
Some dream, judging from that.

03:53.616 --> 03:57.120
- You coming back to the sack or what?
- Hold your horses.

04:01.083 --> 04:02.918
Tina, honey, you gotta cut your fingernails

04:03.043 --> 04:05.087
or you gotta stop that kind of dreaming.

04:05.212 --> 04:06.922
One or the other.

04:16.196 --> 04:21.701
One, two
Freddy's coming for you

04:21.868 --> 04:26.707
Three, four
Better lock your door

04:26.874 --> 04:31.628
Five, six
Grab your crucifix

04:31.796 --> 04:36.300
Seven, eight
Gonna stay up late

04:36.467 --> 04:39.845
Nine, 10
Never sleep again

04:40.013 --> 04:41.972
It was so scary.

04:42.682 --> 04:45.225
When I woke up, it seemed like he was
still in the room.

04:45.393 --> 04:49.104
Sounds like a real boogeyman.
"One, two, Freddy's coming for you. "

04:49.647 --> 04:52.232
That's what it reminded me of:
that old jump-rope song.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.943
The worst nightmare I ever had.
You wouldn't believe it.

04:55.111 --> 04:57.612
Matter of fact,
I had a bad dream last night myself.

04:57.780 --> 05:00.282
I had a hard-on this morning
when I woke up, Tina.

05:00.450 --> 05:03.910
- Had your name written all over it.
- There's four letters in my name, Rod.

05:04.078 --> 05:06.246
How could there be room
on your joint for four letters?

05:07.582 --> 05:10.250
Hey, up yours
with a twirling lawn mower.

05:10.418 --> 05:12.252
Nyah! Rod says the sweetest things.

05:12.420 --> 05:14.171
- Oh, he's nuts about you.
- Yeah, nuts.

05:14.339 --> 05:17.925
Anyway, I couldn't go
back to sleep last night.

05:18.969 --> 05:21.095
- So, what did you dream?
- Forget it, Tina.

05:21.263 --> 05:23.973
The point is that everyone
has a bad dream once in a while.

05:24.141 --> 05:25.433
It's no biggie.

05:25.601 --> 05:28.436
Just tell yourself that's all it is
while you're having it.

05:28.604 --> 05:33.107
Once you do that, you wake right up.
At least it works for me.

05:36.487 --> 05:38.404
Hey! Did you have a nightmare too?

05:42.576 --> 05:47.955
Maybe we're gonna have a big earthquake.
They say things get really weird just before.

05:54.296 --> 05:56.381
I'm so glad you guys
could come over tonight.

05:56.548 --> 05:59.342
When Mom said she was taking off
for two days, I almost died.

05:59.510 --> 06:02.303
No problem, Tina.
Nancy and Glen to the rescue.

06:03.806 --> 06:06.140
Can't believe his mother's letting him
spend the night.

06:06.308 --> 06:10.353
Right, well, she's not, exactly.

06:10.521 --> 06:14.483
I got this cousin who lives near the airport.
It's okay for me to stay with him.

06:14.651 --> 06:17.027
And I got this sound-effects tape
from Rod, and...

06:17.195 --> 06:19.071
Hello, Mom?

06:19.989 --> 06:22.783
Yeah. Out here at Barry's.

06:25.620 --> 06:29.123
Huh? Yeah, noisy as usual.
Glad we don't live here, huh?

06:30.041 --> 06:32.584
Yeah, Aunt Eunice says hello.

06:33.169 --> 06:36.588
Right, right, I'll call you in the morning.
Yeah. Yeah, sure...

06:39.843 --> 06:42.010
Just some kids drag-racing outside,
I think, Mom.

06:44.806 --> 06:47.057
Listen, Ma. I gotta go.
I think there's been an accident out front.

06:49.310 --> 06:50.352
Right.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.398
All right, I'll call the police.

06:55.275 --> 06:57.693
Right, I'll call the police.

06:59.320 --> 07:01.697
No. Just some neighbors
having a fight, I guess.

07:01.865 --> 07:04.032
I'll call you in the morning.

07:11.250 --> 07:12.459
It worked like a charm.

07:12.626 --> 07:13.877
Smooth.

07:14.044 --> 07:15.086
Jesus.

07:17.089 --> 07:19.549
See? I told you you'd be feeling better.

07:20.885 --> 07:24.721
All day long,
I've been seeing that guy's weird face...

07:24.889 --> 07:26.848
...and hearing those fingernails.

07:27.266 --> 07:29.309
Fingernails?

07:29.477 --> 07:31.227
That's amazing, you saying that.

07:31.395 --> 07:34.731
That made me remember
the dream I had last night.

07:34.899 --> 07:36.399
What did you dream?

07:36.567 --> 07:40.403
I dreamed about a guy
in a dirty red and green sweater.

07:42.031 --> 07:44.491
Well, what about the fingernails?

07:45.993 --> 07:49.078
Oh, he scraped
his fingernails along things.

07:49.246 --> 07:51.915
Actually, they were more like
finger-knives or something.

07:52.082 --> 07:55.627
Something he made himself,
but they made a horrible sound.

07:56.212 --> 07:57.462
It was like:

07:59.215 --> 08:04.428
Nancy, you dreamed
about the same creep I did.

08:05.388 --> 08:06.972
That's impossible.

08:09.768 --> 08:10.768
What?

08:12.062 --> 08:13.771
Nothing.

08:13.939 --> 08:17.942
- There's something out there, isn't there?
- I didn't hear anything.

08:18.109 --> 08:20.945
Well, I heard something.

08:54.563 --> 08:58.149
I'm gonna punch out your ugly lights,
whoever you are.

09:02.071 --> 09:03.446
Kitty, kitty.

09:10.830 --> 09:12.664
Chow, chow, chow.

09:18.504 --> 09:22.465
It's Rod Lane bringing Lantz down
just three yards from the goal line!

09:22.633 --> 09:25.176
What a brilliant tackle,
and the fans go wild.

09:25.344 --> 09:29.681
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Came to make up. No big deal.

09:29.849 --> 09:32.601
- Your mom home?
- Course.

09:32.768 --> 09:35.562
- Oh, what's that?
- Intense, huh?

09:39.609 --> 09:41.776
So, what's going on here,
an orgy or something?

09:41.944 --> 09:43.695
Maybe a funeral, dickhead.

09:44.363 --> 09:46.281
It's just a sleepover date, Rod.

09:46.449 --> 09:49.409
Tina and me. Glen was just leaving.

09:51.747 --> 09:54.206
- You see his face?
- "You see his face?"

09:55.208 --> 09:57.710
Your mom ain't home, is she?

09:57.878 --> 10:00.463
Me and Tina got stuff to discuss.

10:00.631 --> 10:02.214
Rod.

10:03.884 --> 10:07.928
We got her mother's bed.
You guys got the rest.

10:11.224 --> 10:14.101
I think we should get out of here.

10:14.895 --> 10:17.063
Hey, you guys are gonna
hang around, right?

10:17.564 --> 10:20.024
I mean, don't leave me alone
with this lunatic.

10:20.192 --> 10:21.567
Please, Nancy?

10:28.033 --> 10:30.826
Glen, not now.

10:31.870 --> 10:34.413
We're here for Tina now, not ourselves.

10:38.210 --> 10:40.628
Why is she so bothered
by a stupid nightmare, anyway?

10:40.796 --> 10:43.839
Because he was scary, that's why.

11:00.942 --> 11:02.359
Yeah.

11:06.197 --> 11:07.447
Oh, Rod!

11:08.658 --> 11:10.117
Yeah. Yeah, Tina!

11:12.120 --> 11:14.454
Oh, God! Oh, God!

11:16.791 --> 11:18.208
Oh, God!

11:18.376 --> 11:21.128
Oh, God! Oh, Rod!

11:23.923 --> 11:26.258
Morality sucks.

11:38.020 --> 11:40.648
I knew there was something about you
I liked.

11:41.483 --> 11:44.819
- You feel better now, right?
- Jungle man fix Jane.

11:46.447 --> 11:47.822
No more fights?

11:50.075 --> 11:51.159
No more fights.

11:51.326 --> 11:53.161
Good.

11:53.328 --> 11:55.872
No more nightmares
for either one of us, then.

11:57.666 --> 12:00.293
When did you have a nightmare?

12:02.671 --> 12:05.006
Guys can have nightmares too,
you know.

12:05.591 --> 12:08.176
You ain't got a corner
on the market or something.

13:09.155 --> 13:10.197
Rod?

13:16.287 --> 13:18.747
Tina.

13:42.982 --> 13:44.816
Tina.

13:46.569 --> 13:49.195
Who do you think you are?

13:50.114 --> 13:52.407
Whoever you are.

15:03.271 --> 15:04.897
Somebody there?

15:05.065 --> 15:06.899
Tina.

15:24.794 --> 15:26.544
Tina.

15:27.088 --> 15:29.214
Who the hell is that?

15:54.407 --> 15:55.740
Tina.

15:57.410 --> 15:59.244
Shit.

16:08.963 --> 16:10.130
Please, God...

16:10.297 --> 16:12.133
This...

16:12.300 --> 16:13.467
...is God.

16:22.769 --> 16:26.397
No! No! No!

16:27.441 --> 16:29.150
Yes!

16:32.696 --> 16:34.572
Tina!

16:36.241 --> 16:37.366
Watch this.

16:47.919 --> 16:50.504
Nancy! Open the door!

16:50.672 --> 16:52.465
Nancy!

17:04.478 --> 17:09.648
Rod, help me! Oh, God!

17:09.817 --> 17:11.777
No! No!

17:11.944 --> 17:13.444
Help me, Rod!

17:13.613 --> 17:16.823
Help me! Rod! Rod!

17:17.742 --> 17:21.328
- Help me!
- Tina!

17:40.515 --> 17:42.140
Tina!

17:42.767 --> 17:46.937
Tina! Tina!

17:47.105 --> 17:49.397
Tina!

17:49.816 --> 17:53.527
- Tina!
- Rod! Rod!

17:55.571 --> 17:57.364
Tina!

18:02.830 --> 18:05.540
- Tina? Tina?
Who did this? I'll kill you.

18:05.707 --> 18:08.626
- Who did this?
- Aaagh! Oh, God, you scared me!

18:26.728 --> 18:27.770
What have you got?

18:27.938 --> 18:30.398
Her name was Tina Gray.
It's her home.

18:30.566 --> 18:33.693
Father abandoned 10 years ago,
mother's in Vegas with her boyfriend.

18:33.861 --> 18:36.237
- We're trying to reach her.
- What's the coroner got?

18:36.405 --> 18:40.741
Something like a razor was the weapon,
but nothing was found at the scene.

18:41.243 --> 18:42.952
It looks like the victim's boyfriend.

18:43.120 --> 18:44.328
Lieutenant.
- Where is she?

18:44.496 --> 18:48.583
- I put her in your office.
- His name's Rod Lane. He's a musician type.

18:48.750 --> 18:53.254
- Arrests for drugs, brawling.
- Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?

18:53.422 --> 18:54.422
She lived there.

18:55.508 --> 18:57.634
I don't mean her.

18:58.511 --> 19:00.679
I mean you.

19:00.847 --> 19:03.765
What was she doing there?

19:04.100 --> 19:06.018
Hello to you too, Donald.

19:06.728 --> 19:09.438
Marge. Okay.

19:14.277 --> 19:16.195
How you doing, baby?

19:16.362 --> 19:18.697
I'm okay, Dad.

19:19.866 --> 19:21.700
Look, I don't wanna
get into this now...

19:21.868 --> 19:24.620
...God knows you need time,
but I sure would like to know...

19:24.787 --> 19:28.957
...what the hell you were doing shacking up
with three kids in the middle of the night...

19:29.125 --> 19:31.335
...especially a lunatic delinquent
like Lane.

19:31.961 --> 19:34.171
Rod is not a lunatic, Dad.

19:34.339 --> 19:37.132
You have a sane explanation
for what he did?

19:39.385 --> 19:41.637
Apparently, he was crazy jealous.

19:41.804 --> 19:45.140
- Nancy said they'd had a fight.
- It wasn't that serious.

19:45.308 --> 19:47.226
Maybe you don't think murder is serious.

19:47.393 --> 19:50.688
How can you say I don't take
her death seriously?

19:54.193 --> 19:56.319
Look, all I meant...

19:58.364 --> 20:00.949
...was that their fights
weren't that serious.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.330
You know, Tina...

20:07.498 --> 20:09.499
...she dreamed this was gonna happen.

20:10.501 --> 20:12.126
What?

20:12.294 --> 20:18.049
She had a nightmare
that someone was trying to kill her.

20:18.467 --> 20:24.347
That's why we were there, Mom.
She just didn't wanna sleep alone.

20:31.146 --> 20:34.065
Police say the victim,
15-year-old Christina Gray...

20:34.233 --> 20:36.734
...had quarreled earlier
with her boyfriend, Rod Lane.

20:36.902 --> 20:40.238
Lane is now the subject
of a citywide manhunt.

20:40.614 --> 20:44.493
The murder weapon, a straight razor
or similar sharp object, has not yet...

20:47.914 --> 20:50.332
Where do you think you're going?

20:51.918 --> 20:53.210
School.

20:53.378 --> 20:55.671
You were tossing and turning
all night last night.

20:55.839 --> 20:58.048
You have no business
going to school today.

20:58.216 --> 21:02.011
I've gotta go to school, Mother.
Otherwise I'll sit up there and go crazy.

21:02.178 --> 21:04.179
Did you sleep?

21:05.015 --> 21:07.224
I'll sleep in study hall.

21:07.726 --> 21:10.561
I'd rather keep busy, you know?

21:11.604 --> 21:14.231
- Right home after?
- Right home after.

21:14.399 --> 21:15.691
Okay.

21:16.401 --> 21:18.819
- See you.
- See you.

21:55.524 --> 21:59.319
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

22:02.490 --> 22:05.784
- They're gonna kill me for sure.
- Nobody's gonna kill you.

22:08.287 --> 22:09.454
Did you do it?

22:10.956 --> 22:14.459
- I never touched her.
- You were screaming like crazy.

22:14.627 --> 22:16.461
There was somebody else there.

22:16.629 --> 22:18.797
The door was locked from your side.

22:18.964 --> 22:22.092
Don't look at me like I'm some
fucking fruitcake or something!

22:22.259 --> 22:26.012
- I'm warning you.
- Just move away from her, son.

22:26.180 --> 22:29.140
Real easy,
like your ass depended on it.

22:29.308 --> 22:30.642
Hold it!

22:30.810 --> 22:33.521
- No!
- Jesus Christ.

22:42.322 --> 22:43.364
Hold it right there.

22:43.532 --> 22:45.991
Watch it. Hold them.
- All right. I'm cool, I'm cool.

22:46.159 --> 22:48.285
Okay, I got him.
On the ground, now.

22:48.453 --> 22:51.414
Come on. Get down.
- Lieutenant, look at this. A switchblade.

22:51.581 --> 22:54.291
I didn't do it! I didn't kill her, Nancy!

22:54.459 --> 22:55.709
Daddy?

22:56.420 --> 22:57.837
You used me.

22:58.338 --> 23:01.173
What the hell were you doing
going to school today for anyway?

23:02.968 --> 23:04.385
Nancy.

23:04.553 --> 23:06.053
Nancy!

23:06.847 --> 23:09.348
- Nancy!
Come on, let go of my arm.

23:09.516 --> 23:13.352
What is seen is not always what is real.

23:14.020 --> 23:18.190
According to Shakespeare,
there was something operating in nature...

23:18.650 --> 23:22.736
...perhaps inside human nature itself,
that was rotten.

23:23.196 --> 23:26.031
A canker, as he put it.

23:26.658 --> 23:29.035
Now, of course,
Hamlet's response to this...

23:29.203 --> 23:35.375
...and to his mother's lies,
was to continually probe and dig.

23:35.626 --> 23:38.253
Just like the gravediggers...

23:38.421 --> 23:41.715
...always trying to get
beneath the surface.

23:42.216 --> 23:46.553
The same is true in a different way
in Julius Caesar. John, go ahead, please.

23:54.687 --> 24:00.233
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
a little ere the mightiest Julius fell.

24:00.401 --> 24:03.320
The graves stood tenantless,
and the sheeted dead...

24:03.488 --> 24:06.615
...did squeak and gibber
in the Roman streets:

24:06.782 --> 24:09.409
As stars with trains of fire
and dews of blood...

24:09.577 --> 24:11.745
...disasters in the sun, and the moist star...

24:11.913 --> 24:14.748
...upon whose influence
Neptune's empire stands...

24:14.916 --> 24:17.250
Nancy.

24:20.254 --> 24:21.630
Nancy.

24:26.595 --> 24:29.931
O God! I could be bounded in a nutshell...

24:30.098 --> 24:34.060
...and count myself a king
of infinite space...

24:34.978 --> 24:40.024
...were it not that I have bad dreams.

25:00.754 --> 25:19.982
Tina?

25:26.531 --> 25:30.325
- Where's your pass?
- Screw your pass.

25:33.871 --> 25:35.789
Hey, Nancy.

25:36.374 --> 25:39.167
No running in the hallway.

25:58.021 --> 25:59.688
Tina?

26:27.134 --> 26:29.010
Tina?

26:48.947 --> 26:54.535
Tina?

27:00.584 --> 27:01.626
Who are you?

27:49.092 --> 27:51.135
Gonna get you.

28:00.312 --> 28:04.232
- It's only a dream!
- Come to Freddy.

28:04.400 --> 28:05.859
Goddamn you!

28:11.907 --> 28:14.242
No! No!

28:14.410 --> 28:17.746
Okay! Okay, okay! Thompson!

28:17.913 --> 28:20.331
I'll call your mother.

28:20.666 --> 28:22.834
Everything is all right now.

28:23.002 --> 28:25.837
- Come on. Sit down.
- No.

28:28.632 --> 28:31.217
I'm okay. I'm fine.

28:31.385 --> 28:35.096
You sure?
- Yeah. I'll go straight home.

28:35.514 --> 28:38.391
You'll need a hall pass.

28:41.103 --> 28:43.188
Back to work.

29:07.547 --> 29:09.465
God!

29:36.660 --> 29:40.579
- And then what happened?
- I told you.

29:41.122 --> 29:44.041
It was dark, but I'm sure
there was somebody in there...

29:44.209 --> 29:45.626
...under the covers with her.

29:46.086 --> 29:49.881
How could somebody be under the covers
with you without you knowing about it?

29:50.049 --> 29:51.925
How the fuck do I know?

29:52.260 --> 29:54.970
I don't expect you to believe me anyway.

29:56.973 --> 29:59.474
What did he look like?

30:01.227 --> 30:02.602
Did you get a look at him?

30:04.939 --> 30:06.565
No.

30:07.108 --> 30:10.485
Well, then how do you know
that somebody else was there?

30:11.445 --> 30:13.613
Because somebody cut her
while I watched.

30:14.073 --> 30:18.702
- And you didn't get a look at him?
- I couldn't even see the fucker.

30:18.870 --> 30:20.996
You could just see...

30:21.747 --> 30:23.957
...cuts happening...

30:24.125 --> 30:25.166
...all at once.

30:25.877 --> 30:28.420
What do you mean all at once?

30:29.630 --> 30:35.302
I mean, it was as if
there were four razors...

30:35.761 --> 30:38.638
...cutting her at the same time...

30:39.056 --> 30:40.974
...but invisible ones.

30:42.143 --> 30:45.229
You know,
I probably could have saved her...

30:46.523 --> 30:48.274
...if I'd have moved sooner...

30:50.360 --> 30:53.779
...but I thought it was
just another nightmare...

30:53.947 --> 30:56.866
...like the one I had the night before.

30:59.244 --> 31:02.163
There was this... There was this guy.

31:04.833 --> 31:07.668
He had knives for fingers.

31:18.305 --> 31:19.889
Hey, you think I did it?

31:22.017 --> 31:23.809
No.

31:40.411 --> 31:44.665
One, two
Freddy's coming for you

31:45.249 --> 31:50.504
Three, four
Better lock your door

31:50.713 --> 31:56.218
Five, six
Grab your crucifix

31:56.386 --> 32:02.349
Seven, eight
Gonna stay up late

32:04.310 --> 32:11.316
Nine, 10
Never sleep again

32:25.498 --> 32:28.583
Nancy?
- What, Mother?

32:28.751 --> 32:30.460
Don't fall asleep in there.

32:30.628 --> 32:33.798
- You could drown, you know.
- Oh, for Pete's sakes.

32:33.966 --> 32:35.299
It happens all the time.

32:35.467 --> 32:37.301
I've heated up some warm milk for you.

32:37.761 --> 32:40.805
Warm milk? Gross.

33:12.880 --> 33:13.963
Help!

33:21.013 --> 33:22.847
Nancy!

33:29.481 --> 33:32.316
- Hold on, baby!
- Mom!

33:37.572 --> 33:38.655
I'm okay.

33:38.823 --> 33:41.325
- You're okay?
- I'm okay.

33:41.493 --> 33:43.827
But I heard you screaming.
You were calling me.

33:43.995 --> 33:47.623
I just slipped
getting out of the tub, Mom.

33:47.791 --> 33:51.335
I told you hundreds of people a year
get killed like that, honey.

33:51.503 --> 33:54.922
I know, but I'm okay, Mother.
I'm sorry for scaring you.

33:55.090 --> 33:56.632
It's okay.

33:56.800 --> 33:58.509
I'll turn down your bed, okay?

33:58.676 --> 34:00.385
All right. I'll get my pajamas on.

34:00.553 --> 34:01.845
Okay.

34:22.909 --> 34:26.286
all-consuming act
of bodily dismemberment.

34:26.831 --> 34:29.040
No! No!

35:04.660 --> 35:07.287
Hi.
- God!

35:08.497 --> 35:11.291
I'm sorry. Your light was on.
I thought I'd see how you were.

35:11.458 --> 35:14.085
Sometimes I wish
you didn't live right across the street.

35:14.253 --> 35:17.339
Will you shut up and let me in?
Ever stand on a trellis in your bare feet?

35:17.507 --> 35:19.049
Get inside before somebody sees you.

35:20.552 --> 35:21.594
I hit my head.

35:21.761 --> 35:24.388
Gotta be quiet.
Mom's not even asleep yet.

35:29.227 --> 35:30.269
If you don't mind.

35:39.279 --> 35:41.488
I heard you freaked out
in English class today.

35:41.656 --> 35:45.618
- Yeah, I guess I did.
- You haven't slept yet, have you?

35:46.745 --> 35:49.622
- Not really.
- What did you do to your arm?

35:50.624 --> 35:52.166
I burned it in English class.

35:57.464 --> 36:00.799
Oh, God. I look 20 years old.

36:03.970 --> 36:06.639
Did you have
any weird dreams last night?

36:06.806 --> 36:08.265
Slept like a rock.

36:08.808 --> 36:12.145
Do you believe that people can dream
about what's going to happen?

36:16.108 --> 36:18.318
- No.
- Do you believe in the boogeyman?

36:18.486 --> 36:19.736
No.

36:19.904 --> 36:22.614
Rod killed Tina, and you know that.

36:23.991 --> 36:26.034
I've got a crazy favor to ask you.

36:26.661 --> 36:28.870
- uh-oh.
- It's nothing hard or anything.

36:30.498 --> 36:33.500
I'm gonna go and look for somebody...

36:33.668 --> 36:38.505
...and I want you to stand
like a sort of a guard, okay?

36:40.216 --> 36:43.051
- Okay?
- Okay.

36:44.303 --> 36:48.515
Now, you can't mess up.
A lot might depend on this.

36:48.683 --> 36:50.350
I won't screw up.

36:50.851 --> 36:52.060
Okay, turn off the light.

36:57.233 --> 37:00.527
- Okay, here's what we're gonna do.
- It's dark in here.

37:01.070 --> 37:03.280
And it's not what you're thinking.

37:54.374 --> 37:56.083
Glen?

37:56.918 --> 37:57.960
Are you still watching?

38:00.715 --> 38:03.175
- Yeah, so?
- I'm just checking.

39:35.561 --> 39:37.353
Glen!

39:38.522 --> 39:40.356
Glen?

39:43.026 --> 39:45.111
Glen!

39:49.784 --> 39:54.746
Rod! Watch out! Rod! Watch out!

39:55.540 --> 39:57.416
Glen!

40:03.715 --> 40:07.885
- Glen!
Nancy.

40:09.888 --> 40:12.473
Nancy.

40:21.900 --> 40:23.859
Glen!

40:24.777 --> 40:27.112
Wake up!

40:28.448 --> 40:30.824
Are you there?

40:30.992 --> 40:33.494
I'm here.

41:02.441 --> 41:05.818
Nancy, help me, please.

41:05.986 --> 41:07.737
- Save me from...
- Freddy.

41:12.743 --> 41:14.702
Glen!

41:19.458 --> 41:24.921
This is just a dream. This isn't real.
This is just a dream. He isn't real. He isn't...

41:42.732 --> 41:44.441
Glen!

41:48.822 --> 42:00.207
No!

42:00.375 --> 42:01.834
Glen, no!

42:15.765 --> 42:18.851
Glen, you bastard.

42:19.686 --> 42:20.853
What did I do?

42:21.021 --> 42:24.857
I just asked you to do one thing,
just stay awake and watch me...

42:25.025 --> 42:28.944
...just wake me up if it looked
like I was having a bad dream...

42:29.112 --> 42:33.408
...and what did you do?
You shithead. You fell asleep.

42:33.576 --> 42:35.035
Nancy?
Oh, shit.

42:36.537 --> 42:37.746
Hurry.

42:39.165 --> 42:41.583
Shut up and stay there.
Don't go away.

42:47.381 --> 42:49.132
Are you okay?

42:49.550 --> 42:52.761
Yeah. It was just a little dream.
I'm going right back to sleep.

42:52.928 --> 42:55.597
Okay. Call me if you need anything, okay?

42:56.557 --> 42:57.599
Okay.

43:05.274 --> 43:06.900
Glen.

43:14.909 --> 43:17.911
- You mind telling me what's going on?
- Oh, just come on.

43:18.079 --> 43:19.079
Yeah.

43:20.122 --> 43:23.500
Garcia, I've gotta see Rod Lane again.

43:23.668 --> 43:27.046
You know, I took the night shift
so I could get some peace and quiet.

43:27.214 --> 43:28.422
Look, it's urgent!

43:45.357 --> 43:48.818
We have reason to believe there might
be something strange going on here.

43:48.985 --> 43:50.444
Got no argument with that.

43:51.154 --> 43:52.279
What are you doing here?

43:52.447 --> 43:55.366
There's an unsolved murder,
and I don't like unsolved murders.

43:55.534 --> 43:57.660
Especially ones that my daughter's
mixed up in.

43:57.828 --> 43:59.120
What are you doing here?

43:59.287 --> 44:02.998
- At this hour, you should be home in bed.
- I just wanna see if he's okay.

44:03.166 --> 44:06.293
Nancy, take my word for it.
The guy's sleeping like a baby.

44:06.461 --> 44:07.586
He's not going anywhere.

44:15.804 --> 44:17.638
Just go down and look at him.

44:20.350 --> 44:21.476
Please, Daddy.

44:23.521 --> 44:27.023
All right. Garcia, give me the keys.

44:27.650 --> 44:29.317
All right.

44:30.403 --> 44:32.028
Where the hell did I put the keys?

44:41.372 --> 44:43.331
Hey, hey!

44:50.339 --> 44:55.010
Help! Help! Help!

45:02.643 --> 45:04.019
Jesus!

45:04.812 --> 45:06.354
Rod!

45:10.735 --> 45:11.777
Hurry. Cut him down.

45:13.863 --> 45:15.823
Grab his legs.
I got him.

45:15.991 --> 45:17.992
God!

45:18.786 --> 45:21.204
Goddamn crazy kid.

45:22.122 --> 45:24.165
Grab his back, would you?
- Got it.

45:24.333 --> 45:26.501
Lower him.

45:50.108 --> 45:52.902
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

45:53.695 --> 45:56.614
May God be
with this young man's soul.

45:58.158 --> 46:03.162
His life and his death
attest to the scriptures' warning...

46:03.372 --> 46:06.749
...that he who lives by the sword
shall die by the sword.

46:08.418 --> 46:12.256
But let us recall also
our Lord's admonition...

46:12.423 --> 46:16.301
...that we judge not, lest we be judged.

46:17.178 --> 46:19.304
And may Rod Lane rest in peace.

46:25.144 --> 46:27.437
Time to go, honey.

46:33.736 --> 46:35.445
Hop in.

46:38.283 --> 46:39.950
The killer's still loose, you know.

46:41.202 --> 46:44.454
You're saying somebody else
killed Tina. Who?

46:45.456 --> 46:47.833
I don't know who he is...

46:48.543 --> 46:52.170
...but he's burned,
and he wears a weird hat...

46:53.590 --> 46:56.842
...and a red and green sweater,
really dirty...

46:57.010 --> 47:01.638
...and he uses these knives,
like giant fingernails.

47:04.977 --> 47:08.980
Better keep her home for a few days,
until she gets over the shock of this.

47:09.148 --> 47:12.483
I've got something better.
I'm going to get her some help.

47:37.509 --> 47:41.054
I don't see why you couldn't just
give me a pill to keep me from dreaming.

47:41.221 --> 47:45.141
Everyone's got to dream, young lady.
If you don't dream, you go.

47:46.226 --> 47:48.394
Okay, all set?

47:49.229 --> 47:53.358
- No.
- Please, Nancy, trust us.

47:53.525 --> 47:56.694
It's not you I don't trust. It's just...

48:02.035 --> 48:03.994
Okay.

48:05.038 --> 48:07.039
Let's do it.

48:12.921 --> 48:15.047
Thank you, nurse.

48:31.940 --> 48:35.567
How long has this been going on?
- Since the murders.

48:35.735 --> 48:37.820
She was fine before that.

48:38.446 --> 48:40.322
Now she thinks her dreams are real.

48:40.490 --> 48:44.493
Well, there's no sign of pathology
in her EEG.

48:44.661 --> 48:47.079
I'd guess that what we have
is just a normal girl...

48:47.247 --> 48:50.082
...who happens to have gone
through two days of hell.

48:56.924 --> 48:58.258
Okay.

48:59.427 --> 49:00.760
She's asleep now.

49:01.595 --> 49:02.929
Thank God.

49:06.308 --> 49:09.269
What the hell are dreams anyway?

49:09.603 --> 49:12.731
Mysteries. Incredible body hocus-pocus.

49:12.898 --> 49:18.319
The truth is we still don't know
what they are or where they come from.

49:24.994 --> 49:29.664
Okay. She's going into deep sleep now.

49:31.959 --> 49:35.128
Heart rate is a little high.
It's just due to anxiety.

49:35.296 --> 49:37.964
Otherwise she's nicely relaxed.

49:38.132 --> 49:42.469
All signs are normal.
She could dream at any time now.

49:46.265 --> 49:48.184
Beta waves are slowing.

49:52.981 --> 49:55.649
She's into REMs now.

49:56.026 --> 49:58.986
She's definitely dreaming now.

49:59.154 --> 50:02.823
It's a good one too.
Typical dream parameter.

50:03.450 --> 50:08.079
A nightmare now
would be plus or minus five or six.

50:08.705 --> 50:11.415
She's about three.

50:18.507 --> 50:20.841
- Doctor, what's she doing now?
- I'm not...

50:21.009 --> 50:22.176
Is she asleep or awake?

50:22.344 --> 50:24.720
Something's wrong.
It never gets this high.

50:25.847 --> 50:28.265
- What's she doing?
- I don't know.

50:28.433 --> 50:29.725
Is she dreaming?

50:36.650 --> 50:39.026
Listen...
- Nancy! Nancy, it's Mom, it's Mom.

50:39.194 --> 50:40.361
Nancy. It's Mom.

50:44.283 --> 50:46.993
What? Her hair.

50:47.161 --> 50:49.246
- Excuse me.
This'll help you sleep.

50:50.206 --> 50:52.040
No!

50:52.208 --> 50:54.709
Oh, my God, her arm!
Get something.

50:56.087 --> 50:58.338
What happened, baby? What happened?

51:01.717 --> 51:04.136
It's okay, it's okay.

51:06.264 --> 51:09.057
I brought something out from my dream.

51:09.225 --> 51:11.268
Where did you get that?

51:13.938 --> 51:15.480
I grabbed it off his head.

51:29.787 --> 51:33.039
Donald, she said she grabbed it
off his head in her dream.

51:33.207 --> 51:34.749
No, I'm not crazy.

51:34.917 --> 51:37.628
I'm holding the damn thing
right here in my hand.

51:37.796 --> 51:42.091
I don't know where she really found it.
I gotta go.

51:53.353 --> 51:56.272
You didn't sleep at all last night,
did you?

51:57.774 --> 52:01.652
- The doctor says you have to sleep, or...
- I'll go even crazier?

52:01.820 --> 52:06.574
I don't think you're crazy,
and stop drinking that damn coffee.

52:10.162 --> 52:14.457
So did you ask Daddy
to have the hat examined?

52:14.875 --> 52:18.002
I threw that filthy thing away.

52:18.503 --> 52:21.464
I don't know where you found it
or what you're trying to prove...

52:21.632 --> 52:26.052
What I learned in the dream clinic,
that's what I'm trying to prove, Mother.

52:26.637 --> 52:31.307
Rod didn't kill Tina,
and he didn't hang himself.

52:32.185 --> 52:33.769
It's this guy.

52:34.979 --> 52:37.314
He's after us in our dreams.

52:40.860 --> 52:43.320
That's just not reality, Nancy.

52:43.488 --> 52:45.656
It's real, Mama.

52:45.823 --> 52:46.949
Feel it.

52:47.659 --> 52:51.328
- Give me that damn thing.
- It even has his name written in it.

52:51.496 --> 52:53.580
Fred Krueger, Mom.

52:53.748 --> 52:55.832
Fred Krueger.

52:56.000 --> 52:59.378
Do you know who that is, Mother?
Because if you do, you better tell me...

52:59.545 --> 53:01.213
...because he's after me now.

53:01.381 --> 53:04.925
Nancy, trust your mother
for once, please.

53:05.301 --> 53:07.261
You'll feel better
when you get some sleep.

53:07.428 --> 53:09.304
Feel better?

53:09.472 --> 53:12.224
You call this feeling better?

53:12.850 --> 53:16.853
Or maybe I should grab that bottle
and veg out with you.

53:17.021 --> 53:20.732
Avoid everything happening to me
by just getting good and loaded.

53:28.158 --> 53:30.910
Fred Krueger can't come
after you, Nancy.

53:31.078 --> 53:35.456
He's dead. Believe me. I know.

53:35.624 --> 53:39.043
You knew about him all this time...

53:39.211 --> 53:42.547
...and you've been acting
like it was something I made up?

53:42.715 --> 53:45.216
Nancy, you're sick.

53:45.384 --> 53:48.886
There's something wrong with you.
You're imagining things.

53:49.054 --> 53:53.474
You'll feel better when you sleep.
It's just as simple as that.

53:53.642 --> 53:55.310
Screw sleep!

54:00.858 --> 54:03.943
Nancy, it's just a nightmare.

54:04.111 --> 54:06.571
That's enough.

54:15.289 --> 54:17.582
Whenever I get nervous, I eat.

54:17.750 --> 54:20.586
And if you can't do that, you sleep.

54:20.754 --> 54:22.713
I used to.

54:22.881 --> 54:24.590
Not anymore.

54:28.011 --> 54:31.263
Did you ever read about
the Balinese way of dreaming?

54:32.390 --> 54:34.558
No.

54:34.893 --> 54:38.270
They got this whole system
they call dream skills.

54:38.897 --> 54:42.858
So if you have a nightmare, for instance,
like falling, right?

54:43.026 --> 54:45.569
- Right.
- Well...

54:45.737 --> 54:48.781
...instead of screaming
and getting all nuts...

54:48.948 --> 54:52.117
...you say, "Okay, I'm gonna
make up my mind...

54:52.285 --> 54:54.119
...that I fall into a magic world. "

54:54.287 --> 54:58.457
Make it something special
like a poem or a song.

54:59.376 --> 55:01.460
They get their art and literature
from dreams.

55:01.628 --> 55:05.381
Just wake up and write it down.
Dream skills.

55:05.548 --> 55:08.342
Well, what if they meet a monster
in their dreams? Then what?

55:08.510 --> 55:11.804
They turn their back on it.
Take away its energy and it disappears.

55:13.306 --> 55:15.141
But what happens
if they don't do that?

55:16.477 --> 55:19.312
Well, I guess those people
don't wake up to tell what happens.

55:19.480 --> 55:21.147
Great.

55:24.944 --> 55:27.695
"Booby Traps and Improvised
Anti-personnel Devices"?

55:29.365 --> 55:31.074
Well, what are you reading that for?

55:32.326 --> 55:34.577
I'm into survival.

55:35.538 --> 55:39.249
- See you.
You're starting to scare me.

55:50.177 --> 55:52.554
Oh, gross.

56:21.543 --> 56:23.377
Mother!

56:28.216 --> 56:29.925
What's with the bars?

56:32.220 --> 56:34.638
- Security.
- Security?

56:34.806 --> 56:39.310
- Security from what?
- Not from what, from whom.

56:41.980 --> 56:44.773
Come down to the cellar with me
and I'll tell you.

57:05.963 --> 57:08.298
You wanna know who Fred Krueger was?

57:09.258 --> 57:13.887
He was a filthy child murderer who killed
at least 20 kids in the neighborhood.

57:14.514 --> 57:15.680
Kids we all knew.

57:17.808 --> 57:19.559
Oh, Mom.

57:20.228 --> 57:22.938
It drove us crazy
when we didn't know who it was...

57:23.105 --> 57:25.982
...but it was even worse
after they caught him.

57:35.243 --> 57:36.618
Did they put him away?

57:36.786 --> 57:39.412
The lawyers got fat
and the judge got famous...

57:39.580 --> 57:42.874
...but somebody forgot to
sign the search warrant in the right place...

57:43.042 --> 57:44.960
...and Krueger was free, just like that.

57:46.337 --> 57:47.963
What did you do, Mother?

57:49.632 --> 57:53.593
A bunch of us parents tracked him down
after they let him out.

57:54.428 --> 57:58.891
We found him in an old abandoned
boiler room where he used to take his kids.

58:00.894 --> 58:01.978
Go on.

58:03.772 --> 58:05.856
We took gasoline...

58:06.692 --> 58:11.612
...we poured it all around the place
and made a trail of it out the door...

58:12.656 --> 58:15.866
...then lit the whole thing up
and watched it burn.

58:22.833 --> 58:25.459
But he can't get you now.

58:26.461 --> 58:29.380
He's dead, honey,
because Mommy killed him.

58:32.593 --> 58:34.760
I even took his knives.

58:44.187 --> 58:45.479
So it's okay now.

58:48.650 --> 58:51.110
You can sleep.

59:01.873 --> 59:03.373
- Hello.
Hi.

59:03.541 --> 59:07.044
- Oh, hi, how you doing?
- Fine.

59:07.211 --> 59:10.589
Stand by your window so I can see you.
You sound a million miles away.

59:15.928 --> 59:17.054
That's much better.

59:17.889 --> 59:20.557
I see your mom went ape
at the security store today.

59:20.725 --> 59:22.643
You look like the Prisoner of Zenda.

59:22.810 --> 59:26.271
- How long's it been since you slept?
- It's coming up on the seventh day.

59:26.731 --> 59:29.483
It's okay. I checked Guinness.
The record's 11.

59:30.485 --> 59:33.236
Listen, Glen. I know who he is.

59:33.404 --> 59:35.447
- Who?
- The killer.

59:35.615 --> 59:37.074
- You do?
- Yes.

59:37.575 --> 59:39.868
And if he gets me,
I'm pretty sure you're next.

59:40.036 --> 59:42.329
Me? Why would anybody wanna kill me?

59:42.497 --> 59:46.208
Don't ask.
Just give me some help nailing the guy...

59:46.376 --> 59:47.584
...when I bring him out.

59:48.003 --> 59:50.672
- Bring him out of what?
- My dream.

59:52.424 --> 59:54.926
- How do you plan to do that?
- Just like I did the hat.

59:55.094 --> 59:57.428
Have a hold of the sucker
when you wake me up.

59:58.138 --> 59:59.514
What...? Wait a minute.

59:59.682 --> 01:00:01.516
You can't bring somebody
out of a dream.

01:00:01.684 --> 01:00:05.978
If I can't, then you can all relax,
because it's just a case of me being nuts.

01:00:06.146 --> 01:00:09.440
Yeah, well, I can save you the trouble.
You're nutty as a fruitcake.

01:00:09.608 --> 01:00:12.652
- I love you anyway.
- Good.

01:00:13.112 --> 01:00:16.280
Then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy
when I bring him out.

01:00:16.448 --> 01:00:18.491
- What?
- You heard me.

01:00:18.659 --> 01:00:22.328
I grab the guy in my dream.
You see me struggling, so you wake me up.

01:00:22.496 --> 01:00:25.498
We both come out, you whack the fucker,
and we got him.

01:00:25.666 --> 01:00:27.417
Are you crazy? Hit him with what?

01:00:27.584 --> 01:00:30.795
You're the jock.
You have a baseball bat or something.

01:00:32.423 --> 01:00:35.049
Just meet me at my porch at midnight.

01:00:35.217 --> 01:00:38.010
- Oh, and meanwhile...
- Meanwhile?

01:00:38.554 --> 01:00:43.559
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.

01:00:47.105 --> 01:00:48.731
Midnight?

01:00:58.158 --> 01:01:00.075
Oh, man.

01:01:00.243 --> 01:01:01.869
Midnight.

01:01:02.036 --> 01:01:04.288
Baseball bats and boogeymen.

01:01:05.498 --> 01:01:07.249
Beautiful.

01:01:33.693 --> 01:01:36.570
Glen. Honey?

01:01:38.532 --> 01:01:40.700
Glen.

01:01:43.621 --> 01:01:45.580
Glen. Glen.

01:01:48.959 --> 01:01:52.712
How can you listen to television
and hear your records at the same time?

01:01:53.297 --> 01:01:56.549
Oh, I wasn't listening to the tube, Ma.
Just watching.

01:01:56.717 --> 01:01:59.093
Miss Nude America
is gonna be on tonight.

01:01:59.845 --> 01:02:03.556
- How can you hear what she's going to say?
- Who cares what she says?

01:02:04.266 --> 01:02:06.309
Don't be such a smart guy.

01:02:06.477 --> 01:02:10.522
I want you to go to bed.
It's almost midnight.

01:02:10.689 --> 01:02:13.942
Goodness knows we've all
had a lot to deal with these last few days.

01:02:14.109 --> 01:02:19.405
- I will, Mom. You guys turning in?
- Pretty soon. Now get to bed.

01:02:30.167 --> 01:02:34.046
It's over now, baby.
The nightmare's over.

01:02:34.214 --> 01:02:35.923
Please.

01:02:37.425 --> 01:02:39.385
Okay.

01:03:56.672 --> 01:03:58.924
You shouldn't stare.

01:03:59.884 --> 01:04:01.927
You know what I think?

01:04:02.094 --> 01:04:05.305
I think that kid is some kind of lunatic
or something.

01:04:05.473 --> 01:04:10.060
Oh, you shouldn't talk that way
about that poor child.

01:04:10.227 --> 01:04:12.354
You mean those bars?

01:04:12.521 --> 01:04:16.483
Marge is just being cautious,
what with her being all alone...

01:04:16.651 --> 01:04:21.197
...and Nancy acting so nervous lately.

01:04:21.365 --> 01:04:22.865
I don't care what you say.

01:04:23.033 --> 01:04:26.285
I don't want that kid
hanging around with our son anymore.

01:05:16.754 --> 01:05:18.672
Glen, answer the phone.

01:05:20.633 --> 01:05:22.259
Hello.

01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:29.933
Just a minute. It's her.
She wants to talk to Glen.

01:05:30.101 --> 01:05:31.977
About what?

01:05:32.437 --> 01:05:35.272
What's this about, Nancy?

01:05:36.482 --> 01:05:38.108
Just a minute.

01:05:38.276 --> 01:05:43.321
She says it's private, very private
and very important.

01:05:43.489 --> 01:05:46.950
Give me that. Glen's asleep.
You'll have to talk to him tomorrow.

01:05:47.118 --> 01:05:50.078
You've just gotta be firm
with these kids, that's all. Let's go.

01:05:50.246 --> 01:05:52.289
As a matter of fact...

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:04.468
Damn.

01:06:07.096 --> 01:06:12.727
Glen. Don't fall asleep.

01:06:23.489 --> 01:06:25.031
Glen?

01:06:30.329 --> 01:06:32.413
No!

01:06:36.543 --> 01:06:38.669
Oh, brilliant.

01:06:40.005 --> 01:06:43.132
What if Glen tries to call?

01:07:16.835 --> 01:07:20.712
- Hello.
I'm your boyfriend now, Nancy.

01:07:32.267 --> 01:07:34.476
My boyfriend.

01:07:41.109 --> 01:07:46.071
- Mom!
- Locked, locked, locked, locked.

01:07:46.239 --> 01:07:49.199
I locked it all up. I had to.

01:07:49.367 --> 01:07:54.079
Nancy, you are going to
get some sleep tonight if it kills me.

01:07:54.247 --> 01:07:57.082
Give me the key, Mother.

01:07:57.250 --> 01:08:01.087
I can't. I don't even have it on me. See?

01:08:01.255 --> 01:08:02.255
Damn it!

01:08:10.723 --> 01:08:12.599
ANNOuNCER
It is now 12 midnight...

01:08:12.766 --> 01:08:17.145
...and this is Station KRGR
leaving the air.

01:08:20.899 --> 01:08:26.196
No! No! No! Ma!

01:08:30.993 --> 01:08:34.287
Glen! Glen!

01:09:07.404 --> 01:09:10.573
Come on, Frankie.
Give me a hand. Come on.

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:15.371
You won't need a stretcher up there.
You'll need a mop.

01:09:17.999 --> 01:09:20.417
Let's go. Let's go.

01:09:22.921 --> 01:09:24.546
Hey!

01:09:26.174 --> 01:09:27.800
Don't tell me it's another one.

01:09:27.968 --> 01:09:29.676
Lieutenant, I'm sorry to wake you...

01:09:29.844 --> 01:09:32.179
...but I've never seen anything
like this before...

01:09:32.346 --> 01:09:35.765
...and this is your neighborhood,
so I thought I'd better call right away.

01:09:35.934 --> 01:09:38.685
The coroner's upstairs now,
but I don't think he's gonna...

01:09:53.953 --> 01:09:55.870
Would have woke me up.

01:09:57.915 --> 01:09:59.958
Oh, my God.

01:10:01.210 --> 01:10:03.670
Hello?

01:10:03.838 --> 01:10:05.714
Yeah, I'll get him right away.

01:10:06.549 --> 01:10:08.842
Lieutenant, it's your daughter.

01:10:17.101 --> 01:10:20.478
- Nancy.
- Hi, Daddy.

01:10:21.272 --> 01:10:25.191
- I know what happened.
- I haven't been upstairs yet.

01:10:25.359 --> 01:10:28.028
Yeah, but you know he's dead, right?

01:10:28.195 --> 01:10:30.280
Yeah. Apparently he's dead.

01:10:32.199 --> 01:10:35.702
Listen, Daddy.
I've got a proposition for you.

01:10:36.495 --> 01:10:39.289
- Listen very carefully, please.
- Nancy.

01:10:39.457 --> 01:10:42.001
I'm gonna go
and get the guy who did it...

01:10:43.045 --> 01:10:46.422
...and I want you to be there to arrest him
when I bring him out, okay?

01:10:46.590 --> 01:10:48.758
Just tell me who did it.
I'll go get him, baby.

01:10:50.052 --> 01:10:53.471
Fred Krueger did it, Daddy,
and only I can get him.

01:10:53.638 --> 01:10:56.432
It's my nightmare he comes to.

01:10:56.600 --> 01:11:01.937
Just come here and break the door down
in exactly 20 minutes.

01:11:02.105 --> 01:11:05.107
- Can you do that?
- Yeah, sure.

01:11:05.275 --> 01:11:08.986
That'll be exactly half past midnight.

01:11:10.822 --> 01:11:14.658
Time... Time enough for me
to fall asleep and find him.

01:11:14.826 --> 01:11:17.411
Honey, look, you just do that.
Get yourself some sleep.

01:11:17.579 --> 01:11:20.456
- That's what I've been telling you.
- But you'll be here?

01:11:20.624 --> 01:11:24.085
- They're waiting for you upstairs.
- Yeah. Sure, I'll be there, sweetheart.

01:11:24.252 --> 01:11:28.214
Now, look, you just get yourself
some rest, please. Deal?

01:11:28.382 --> 01:11:31.384
- Deal.
- I love you, sweetheart.

01:11:34.679 --> 01:11:37.974
Look, go outside
and watch my daughter's house.

01:11:38.142 --> 01:11:41.436
- If you see anything funny, call me.
- Anything funny? Like what?

01:11:41.604 --> 01:11:45.774
I don't know. One thing for sure,
I don't want her coming over here.

01:11:45.942 --> 01:11:48.902
She's too far gone
to be able to handle this.

01:13:07.649 --> 01:13:11.944
- What the hell did that, lieutenant?
- I don't know.

01:13:12.112 --> 01:13:16.949
- What's the coroner got to say?
- He's in the john puking since he saw it.

01:13:20.913 --> 01:13:24.123
I guess I should have
told you about him then.

01:13:25.042 --> 01:13:28.504
Let's just get some sleep, Mom.
It's gonna be okay.

01:13:28.671 --> 01:13:31.673
I was just trying to protect you.

01:13:32.509 --> 01:13:35.636
I didn't see
how much you needed to know.

01:13:37.722 --> 01:13:42.267
You face things. That's your nature.

01:13:42.435 --> 01:13:43.852
That's your gift...

01:13:45.605 --> 01:13:48.649
...but sometime
you have to turn away too.

01:14:00.578 --> 01:14:01.870
I love you.

01:14:06.209 --> 01:14:08.126
I love you too, baby.

01:14:22.977 --> 01:14:24.477
Night.

01:14:29.525 --> 01:14:32.026
Okay, Krueger.

01:14:32.861 --> 01:14:34.862
We play in your court.

01:14:50.546 --> 01:14:55.049
And now I lay me down to sleep.
I pray the Lord my soul to keep...

01:14:55.217 --> 01:15:02.015
...and if I die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

01:15:05.561 --> 01:15:09.272
AuTOMATED VOICE: Countdown mode.
Ten minutes and counting.

01:15:22.162 --> 01:15:24.955
What if they meet a monster
in their dreams? Then what?

01:15:25.123 --> 01:15:28.250
They turn their back on it.
Take away its energy and it disappears.

01:15:28.418 --> 01:15:30.252
But what happens if they don't do that?

01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:33.672
Well, then I guess those people
don't wake up to tell what happens.

01:16:50.918 --> 01:16:53.586
Nancy.

01:17:02.471 --> 01:17:05.766
You dreamed about the same creep I did.

01:17:06.810 --> 01:17:09.395
Gonna get you.

01:17:17.696 --> 01:17:22.533
No! No! No!

01:17:30.333 --> 01:17:33.002
Nancy.

01:18:08.372 --> 01:18:10.499
Krueger!

01:18:13.169 --> 01:18:15.128
I'm here!

01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:05.490
Come out and show yourself,
you bastard!

01:20:10.204 --> 01:20:11.747
Shit.

01:20:16.044 --> 01:20:18.295
Come on, Krueger! Follow me!

01:20:24.802 --> 01:20:26.762
Damn it!

01:20:27.639 --> 01:20:29.848
Where are you?

01:20:30.099 --> 01:20:32.893
Where are you, Krueger?

01:20:33.561 --> 01:20:36.355
I know you're here.

01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:40.192
AuTOMATED VOICE:
Final 10 seconds.

01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:42.362
Nine, eight, seven, six...

01:20:42.529 --> 01:20:44.197
Nancy.

01:20:46.408 --> 01:20:49.327
I got you now!

01:21:18.065 --> 01:21:20.900
I'm crazy after all.

01:21:34.039 --> 01:21:35.958
It's on, Krueger!

01:21:36.126 --> 01:21:39.712
Take it down! Come and get me!

01:21:42.090 --> 01:21:44.299
Help! I've got him! Hey, Daddy!

01:21:44.467 --> 01:21:48.303
I've got him trapped!
Help! Where are you?

01:21:48.471 --> 01:21:52.266
Everything's gonna be all right!
Everything's under control!

01:21:52.434 --> 01:21:54.852
Get my dad, you asshole!

01:21:58.523 --> 01:22:00.524
Daddy!

01:22:04.988 --> 01:22:07.698
Come on! He's in here!

01:22:07.866 --> 01:22:09.658
Don't let him kill me too!

01:22:25.133 --> 01:22:27.342
Come on, Freddy. Can't you catch me?

01:22:30.389 --> 01:22:32.515
I'm gonna split you in two.

01:22:40.483 --> 01:22:44.235
Help! Daddy, help me, please!

01:22:44.653 --> 01:22:46.488
Maybe I better go tell the lieutenant.

01:22:57.041 --> 01:22:59.834
I'll kill you slow.

01:23:02.838 --> 01:23:04.839
Now, where are you?

01:23:05.007 --> 01:23:06.508
Hey!

01:23:07.051 --> 01:23:11.262
No! No, no! No!

01:23:38.875 --> 01:23:42.211
Daddy, I did it! Please hurry!

01:23:43.088 --> 01:23:45.005
Daddy!

01:23:45.173 --> 01:23:47.424
Where are you?

01:23:49.970 --> 01:23:52.012
Parker, I need some help here!

01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:55.307
Okay, you guys. Come on, let's go.
Let's go. Al, Jim, get over here.

01:23:55.475 --> 01:23:58.060
- Nancy!
Daddy!

01:23:58.228 --> 01:24:00.688
- Daddy!
Get you out.

01:24:00.856 --> 01:24:04.191
Open the door!
Watch yourself, lieutenant.

01:24:04.359 --> 01:24:05.401
I got it.

01:24:05.569 --> 01:24:08.445
Dad, it's Krueger!
Get out of the way.

01:24:10.365 --> 01:24:11.991
Nancy.

01:24:14.244 --> 01:24:16.203
This way, guys. Come down here.

01:24:16.371 --> 01:24:19.081
What the hell came through here?
As if I know.

01:24:19.249 --> 01:24:20.584
Oh, my God.

01:24:20.751 --> 01:24:22.711
Nancy, what the hell is going on?

01:24:22.879 --> 01:24:24.504
Parker, get up here!

01:24:24.672 --> 01:24:28.967
- We got a fire up here too.
Okay, yeah, we're on our way up.

01:24:31.762 --> 01:24:34.181
What the hell is going on, Nancy?

01:24:34.348 --> 01:24:36.308
He's after Mother!

01:24:48.070 --> 01:24:51.781
Daddy! Watch out! He's under there!

01:25:09.634 --> 01:25:13.678
Mother! Mother, Mother!

01:25:18.685 --> 01:25:20.353
Now do you believe me?

01:25:21.063 --> 01:25:23.689
They've got the fires out downstairs.

01:25:23.857 --> 01:25:25.816
Everything okay up here?

01:25:36.703 --> 01:25:38.746
I'm okay.

01:25:40.332 --> 01:25:42.792
You go downstairs.

01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:45.628
I'll be there in a minute.

01:25:49.508 --> 01:25:51.425
Lieutenant, is everything all right?

01:25:51.593 --> 01:25:54.136
I don't know. I don't know.

01:26:26.254 --> 01:26:27.796
I know you're there, Freddy.

01:26:32.719 --> 01:26:35.595
You think you was
gonna get away from me?

01:26:35.763 --> 01:26:37.973
I know you too well now, Freddy.

01:26:39.976 --> 01:26:42.769
Now you die.

01:26:44.605 --> 01:26:46.898
It's too late, Krueger.

01:26:47.066 --> 01:26:49.860
I know the secret now.

01:26:50.236 --> 01:26:54.781
This is just a dream. You're not alive.

01:26:54.949 --> 01:26:58.660
This whole thing is just a dream.

01:27:00.913 --> 01:27:03.082
I want my mother and friends again.

01:27:03.667 --> 01:27:05.001
You what?

01:27:05.711 --> 01:27:09.756
I take back every bit of energy
I gave you.

01:27:11.008 --> 01:27:12.925
You're nothing.

01:27:15.429 --> 01:27:16.471
You're shit.

01:27:29.443 --> 01:27:31.319
God.

01:27:32.488 --> 01:27:34.739
It's bright.

01:27:36.825 --> 01:27:39.327
It's gonna burn off soon,
or it wouldn't be so bright.

01:27:39.787 --> 01:27:43.456
- Feeling better?
- Oh, I feel like a million bucks.

01:27:43.624 --> 01:27:47.585
They say you've bottomed out
when you can't remember the night before.

01:27:47.753 --> 01:27:52.715
You know, baby, I'm gonna stop drinking.
I just don't feel like it anymore.

01:27:52.883 --> 01:27:55.009
Did I keep you awake last night?

01:27:55.177 --> 01:27:57.888
You look a little bit peaked.

01:27:58.139 --> 01:28:02.434
No. I guess I just slept heavy.

01:28:02.977 --> 01:28:06.397
Okay. I'll see you.

01:28:06.564 --> 01:28:08.273
See you.

01:28:11.778 --> 01:28:13.404
Stop it.
Hi, everybody.

01:28:13.571 --> 01:28:17.991
You believe this fog?
- Oh, I believe anything is possible.

01:28:18.159 --> 01:28:20.953
Bye.
Looking good, girl.

01:28:21.121 --> 01:28:23.914
Hey!
- What happened?

01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:27.167
What's going on?

01:28:27.836 --> 01:28:30.796
- Hey. Hey, I'm not doing this.
Glen! Let us out!

01:28:30.964 --> 01:28:33.465
- I'm not doing this.
- What's going on with the window?

01:28:33.633 --> 01:28:35.509
No, Mother!

01:28:36.177 --> 01:28:42.182
- Mother! Mother! Mother!
What's going on?

01:28:46.479 --> 01:28:51.191
One, two
Freddy's coming for you

01:28:56.365 --> 01:29:01.286
Three, four
Better lock your door

01:29:01.454 --> 01:29:06.541
Five, six
Grab your crucifix

01:29:07.376 --> 01:29:12.589
Seven, eight
Gonna stay up late

01:29:12.756 --> 01:29:19.554
Nine, 10
Never sleep again
