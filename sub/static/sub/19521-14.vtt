San Antonio, Texas.</i>

00:06.707 --> 00:09.141
<i>It's Kacy Catanzaro.</i>

00:13.381 --> 00:16.582
- It's gonna be my last year
here in Las Vegas,

00:16.584 --> 00:19.218
and that's really tough
to think about.

00:19.220 --> 00:22.054
- Oh!
- Yes!

00:22.056 --> 00:23.355
- Oh!
- She's done it!

00:23.357 --> 00:25.958
History has been made!

00:28.129 --> 00:30.195

00:39.874 --> 00:43.642
for introducing mainstream
America to "Ninja Warrior."

00:43.644 --> 00:44.943
- Don't underestimate

00:44.945 --> 00:47.546
the strength of gymnast
Kacy Catanzaro.

00:47.548 --> 00:50.716
- How does she do that?
- Right?

00:50.718 --> 00:54.253
<i>- Look at all the women that
are here doing awesome things.</i>

00:54.255 --> 00:56.522
A lot of us are here
because of her.

00:56.524 --> 00:57.723
<i>- Wow!</i>

00:57.725 --> 00:59.525
<i>- Did you see how high
she got?</i>

00:59.527 --> 01:01.827
<i>- Everything I saw Kacy do,
I was like,</i>

01:01.829 --> 01:05.030
"Yes, like, I'm so doing this."

01:05.032 --> 01:08.033

<i>Girls can go out there and do

01:23.350 --> 01:26.652
- I feel like I've really shown
my fight over these five years,

01:26.654 --> 01:29.655
and I just... I want to go out
the best that I can,

01:29.657 --> 01:32.424

Hello, everyone,
and thanks for being with us

02:13.434 --> 02:15.767
for night two of
the national finals.

02:15.769 --> 02:17.236
I'm Matt Iseman.

02:17.238 --> 02:20.205
- And I'm Akbar Gbajabiamila.
- Mat, I am all in.

02:20.207 --> 02:23.642
We've got a crazy crowd
and some all-star athletes.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.010
<i>This is gonna be a big night.</i>

02:25.012 --> 02:26.778
<i>- Now, remember,
in the national finals</i>

02:26.780 --> 02:28.881
you must hit the buzzer
to move on,

02:28.883 --> 02:31.049
and last week we got off
to a hot start

02:31.051 --> 02:32.851
with a big jackpot
of finishers.

02:32.853 --> 02:35.254
- Yeah, and I expect
that streak to continue

02:35.256 --> 02:38.824
with the all-star athletes
we're gonna see tonight.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.459
<i>- Oh, my goodness.</i>

02:40.461 --> 02:42.261
<i>- Let's start with the guy
who went further</i>

02:42.263 --> 02:45.998
<i>than anyone in Vegas
last season, Drew Drechsel.</i>

02:46.000 --> 02:48.567
<i>- Yes!</i>
- Whoo!

02:48.569 --> 02:50.969
<i>- We got the woman
who made history</i>

02:50.971 --> 02:53.038
<i>on stage one, Jessie Graff.</i>

02:53.040 --> 02:55.641
<i>- The first woman
to complete stage one!</i>

02:55.643 --> 02:59.011
<i>- We're also gonna see
the Philly Phoenix,</i>

02:59.013 --> 03:00.612
<i>Najee Richardson.</i>

03:00.614 --> 03:03.048
- Yeah!

03:03.050 --> 03:05.317
<i>- And finally, Kacy Catanzaro</i>

03:05.319 --> 03:07.619
<i>is retiring from
ninja competition.</i>

03:07.621 --> 03:10.222
<i>This could be
her final run tonight.</i>

03:10.224 --> 03:13.792
<i>- Oh, my goodness.</i>
- As we saw last week,

03:13.794 --> 03:17.062
there are lots of new twists
and turns on stage one.

03:17.064 --> 03:19.865
For a look at the course,
let's go down to Kristine Leahy.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.333
- Thanks, Matt.

03:21.335 --> 03:23.135
Stage one is made up
of eight brutal obstacles,

03:23.137 --> 03:24.436
and in order to advance,

03:24.438 --> 03:28.407
competitors must
complete it in under 2:35.

03:28.409 --> 03:29.708
<i>It starts with Snake Run,</i>

03:29.710 --> 03:31.443
<i>which last week
took out veterans</i>

03:31.445 --> 03:34.146
<i>including Brian Wilczewski.</i>

03:34.148 --> 03:36.782
<i>- You can't take any obstacle
for granted.</i>

03:36.784 --> 03:38.250
<i>- Up next is
the Propeller Bar,</i>

03:38.252 --> 03:39.751
<i>which ended the season</i>

03:39.753 --> 03:43.755
<i>of familiar faces like
Brazi Bro Lucas Gomes.</i>

03:43.757 --> 03:44.823
<i>- Oh!
- Oh!</i>

03:44.825 --> 03:46.458
<i>- Boy, he just did a flip.</i>

03:46.460 --> 03:48.260
<i>- This new obstacle,
the Double Dipper,</i>

03:48.262 --> 03:50.262
<i>knocked out the most
on night one,</i>

03:50.264 --> 03:53.599
<i>including big-name
competitors like Lorin Ball.</i>

03:53.601 --> 03:55.834
<i>Oh!</i>

03:55.836 --> 03:58.604
<i>- The Jumping Spider was
another dangerous obstacle,</i>

03:58.606 --> 04:01.840
<i>eliminating top names
like Anthony DeFranco.</i>

04:01.842 --> 04:05.744
<i>- No!
- No! Speed kills.</i>

04:05.746 --> 04:07.613
<i>- The fifth obstacle,
Parkour Run,</i>

04:07.615 --> 04:10.716
<i>is where many top ninjas,
including Jesse Labreck,</i>

04:10.718 --> 04:13.385
<i>got hung up
and lost valuable time.</i>

04:13.387 --> 04:16.255
<i>- But she's through.
- With tired legs,</i>

04:16.257 --> 04:19.024
<i>competitors will then have
to run up the Warped Wall.</i>

04:19.026 --> 04:20.692
<i>- Gets through it.</i>

04:20.694 --> 04:22.894
<i>- And then dash across this
new balance obstacle,</i>

04:22.896 --> 04:24.263
<i>the Domino Pipes.</i>

04:24.265 --> 04:25.797
<i>- One more to go!</i>

04:25.799 --> 04:28.133
<i>- Finally, it's
the Flying Squirrel.</i>

04:28.135 --> 04:30.469
<i>If competitors can swing
across to the cargo net</i>

04:30.471 --> 04:33.372
<i>and climb to the buzzer
before the clock hits zero...</i>

04:33.374 --> 04:34.806
<i>- Allyssa Beird!</i>

04:34.808 --> 04:36.608
- They're advancing
to stage two.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.176
Guys?

04:38.178 --> 04:39.778
<i>- And we're gonna
kick things off</i>

04:39.780 --> 04:42.781
<i>with one of the craziest
characters from the season.</i>

04:42.783 --> 04:45.250
<i>This is North Carolina's
Rigel Henry.</i>

04:45.252 --> 04:48.487
- Whoo!
<i>- A construction worker</i>

04:48.489 --> 04:51.290
<i>who looks like a movie star.</i>

04:51.292 --> 04:56.428
- People say I totally look
like Spicoli, which is cool.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.930
<i>- You talk about fast times.</i>

04:58.932 --> 05:01.867
- On the Daytona qualifiers...

05:01.869 --> 05:03.502
Boom,
had a little collision.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.404
<i>- Looks like he might have
banged that nose.</i>

05:05.406 --> 05:07.272
<i>- The pain's part of progress.</i>

05:07.274 --> 05:09.541
No pain, no ninja gain.

05:09.543 --> 05:10.542
Yeah!

05:10.544 --> 05:13.145
- Come on, Rigel.

05:13.147 --> 05:15.580
- After Daytona
it was nonstop,

05:15.582 --> 05:19.384
four competitions,
four different states.

05:19.386 --> 05:21.520
<i>So this one competition,</i>

05:21.522 --> 05:23.855
<i>I had to wear
a number on my shirt,</i>

05:23.857 --> 05:25.390
but I don't like
running with a shirt.

05:25.392 --> 05:27.125
<i>- Is that really
in your stomach?</i>

05:27.127 --> 05:28.960
- Boom, it went on the skin.

05:28.962 --> 05:31.263
- Dude, you're a wild man.

05:31.265 --> 05:33.365
<i>- As a rookie I believe</i>

05:33.367 --> 05:35.767
I can make it to the top
of Mount Midoriyama.

05:35.769 --> 05:39.571
I don't drink, I don't smoke,
and I don't stress.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.973
<i>All I need are
some tasty waves,</i>

05:41.975 --> 05:46.078
stage one buzzer, and I'm fine.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.612
<i>- Well, he looks like Spicoli,</i>

05:47.614 --> 05:49.414
<i>but he's definitely
not in high school.</i>

05:49.416 --> 05:51.016
<i>He's married, and his wife</i>

05:51.018 --> 05:53.251
<i>and four-year-old daughter
are on the sidelines.</i>

05:53.253 --> 05:54.753
<i>- Okay, now,
that's a little crazy,</i>

05:54.755 --> 05:56.221
<i>putting pins through his skin?</i>

05:58.459 --> 05:59.958
<i>- First up is Snake Run.</i>

05:59.960 --> 06:02.394
<i>Remember, just 2:35
to complete the course,</i>

06:02.396 --> 06:05.163
<i>and he bounds right through.</i>

06:05.165 --> 06:07.833
<i>- And goes right into obstacle
two, the Propeller Bar.</i>

06:07.835 --> 06:10.068
<i>Has to grab the rope
and swing over</i>

06:10.070 --> 06:12.170
<i>to the landing pad.
Gets through.</i>

06:14.708 --> 06:17.676
<i>- Okay, but here's where it
gets real, the Double Dipper.</i>

06:17.678 --> 06:20.345
<i>- This took out more athletes
than any other obstacle</i>

06:20.347 --> 06:22.047
<i>in night one.</i>

06:22.049 --> 06:26.017
<i>Has to ride that bar down,
then jump to that second bar.</i>

06:26.019 --> 06:27.419
<i>- Oh, my.
- Yeah!</i>

06:27.421 --> 06:30.722
<i>- And he makes it through.</i>

06:30.724 --> 06:32.858
<i>He's going at
a breakneck pace</i>

06:32.860 --> 06:35.193
<i>and going right into
the Jumping Spider.</i>

06:35.195 --> 06:36.561
<i>- Oh, get it...
- Oh!</i>

06:36.563 --> 06:39.798
<i>- Well, it was fast times,</i>

06:39.800 --> 06:42.100
<i>but not the ending Rigel Henry
wanted,</i>

06:42.102 --> 06:44.069
<i>and his season is over.</i>

06:44.071 --> 06:46.238
<i>- Timing is key
on the Jumping Spider.</i>

06:46.240 --> 06:49.708
<i>You want to have your arms
and legs hit at the same time,</i>

06:49.710 --> 06:51.209
<i>but look at his right foot.</i>

06:51.211 --> 06:53.512
<i>He just missed
and couldn't recover,</i>

06:53.514 --> 06:57.115
<i>and his season is over.</i>

06:57.117 --> 06:59.284
<i>- Well, Rigel Henry
had some great hair;</i>

06:59.286 --> 07:01.987
<i>our next athlete
cuts hair for a living.</i>

07:01.989 --> 07:04.389
<i>This is 23-year-old
Benjamin Humphrys,</i>

07:04.391 --> 07:06.958
<i>a hairstylist
from Los Angeles.</i>

07:06.960 --> 07:09.261
<i>- Look at that, signing his
hat and giving it to a fan.</i>

07:09.263 --> 07:11.730
<i>He's big-time now.</i>

07:11.732 --> 07:13.965
<i>- We told you his story
this season.</i>

07:13.967 --> 07:15.967
<i>Humphrys came out to compete
for his brother,</i>

07:15.969 --> 07:17.602
<i>who's autistic,</i>

07:17.604 --> 07:20.806
<i>and this competition has
really brought them closer.</i>

07:22.643 --> 07:24.643
<i>- My brother, Miles,
he just got diagnosed</i>

07:24.645 --> 07:26.711
with having autism.

07:26.713 --> 07:29.181
<i>My brother's now growing up
and being made fun of</i>

07:29.183 --> 07:30.782
<i>just 'cause he's different.</i>

07:30.784 --> 07:32.083
I want to show my brother

07:32.085 --> 07:35.153
that you can accomplish
anything you want

07:35.155 --> 07:37.255
if you try hard enough
and push hard enough.

07:37.257 --> 07:41.593
<i>- Ooh-ooh-hoo, my goodness.</i>

07:41.595 --> 07:43.261
<i>- On the qualifiers,
every time I was like,</i>

07:43.263 --> 07:44.696
<i>"I'm a little tired.
I'ma little stressed"...</i>

07:44.698 --> 07:46.631
<i>- He's fully extended.
- All I could hear</i>

07:46.633 --> 07:48.266
<i>is my brother screaming.</i>

07:48.268 --> 07:50.535
- Yeah!
- It helped.

07:51.572 --> 07:56.041
<i>- Yes! He's done it,
as his brother watches.</i>

07:56.043 --> 07:57.576
- He hit the buzzer,

07:57.578 --> 08:01.480
and I was a whole entirely
emotional after that moment.

08:01.482 --> 08:03.982
- Miles, what's making you
so emotional? Come on over.

08:03.984 --> 08:07.452
- Come on, Miles.

08:07.454 --> 08:10.489
- I really am proud of him.

08:10.491 --> 08:11.890
<i>- After the episode aired,</i>

08:11.892 --> 08:13.692
<i>he's a lot more
confident in himself.</i>

08:13.694 --> 08:16.561
- I may even want
to do it someday.

08:19.333 --> 08:20.765
<i>- I see that he wants more,</i>

08:20.767 --> 08:23.468
wants to go places,
meet people,

08:23.470 --> 08:26.137
just get out
of his box a little.

08:26.139 --> 08:28.106
- I can't wait to see
my brother

08:28.108 --> 08:30.375
take on the course in Vegas.

08:30.377 --> 08:31.810
<i>- I have to hit the buzzer.</i>

08:31.812 --> 08:34.044
Miles, my stage one
run's for you.

08:37.951 --> 08:41.152
<i>- There's Miles on
the sideline with mom.</i>

08:41.154 --> 08:42.687
<i>- Miles looks nervous.</i>

08:45.325 --> 08:47.559
<i>Humphrys, one of the many
impressive rookies</i>

08:47.561 --> 08:48.927
<i>from this season,</i>

08:48.929 --> 08:51.363
<i>gets through Snake Run.
Miles is happy.</i>

08:51.365 --> 08:53.398
<i>- Yeah, he still
looks nervous though.</i>

08:53.400 --> 08:57.135
<i>- Now it's obstacle two,
the Propeller Bar.</i>

08:57.137 --> 08:59.137
<i>- Oh!
- Shoot! Whoa!</i>

08:59.139 --> 09:01.273
<i>- A hard fall for Humphrys.</i>

09:01.275 --> 09:06.511
<i>Luckily he's okay; and Miles,
heartbroken, but what a run.</i>

09:06.513 --> 09:09.347
<i>Unfortunately, an abrupt end
for Benjamin Humphrys.</i>

09:09.349 --> 09:11.349
<i>- Let's watch this again
in real time.</i>

09:11.351 --> 09:13.285
<i>You know, he got twisted
around</i>

09:13.287 --> 09:16.454
<i>and really smacked
the water on the fall.</i>

09:16.456 --> 09:18.390
<i>And then when you watch it
in slo-mo,</i>

09:18.392 --> 09:21.159
<i>you can see he got
his arms over the bar</i>

09:21.161 --> 09:22.961
<i>but just couldn't hang on,</i>

09:22.963 --> 09:25.096
<i>and that's an 18-foot fall
from up there.</i>

09:28.635 --> 09:30.835
<i>- We're just getting started
on night two</i>

09:30.837 --> 09:32.804
<i>of the national finals,</i>

09:32.806 --> 09:35.206
<i>and it's gonna be
an all-star shootout.</i>

09:35.208 --> 09:38.310
<i>- Get your popcorn ready.
- She made history last year.</i>

09:38.312 --> 09:40.011
<i>- Ooh!
- Yes!</i>

09:40.013 --> 09:43.214
<i>Can Jessie Graff conquer
this course once again?</i>

09:43.216 --> 09:46.184
<i>This woman redefining strong.</i>

09:46.186 --> 09:49.054
<i>- And the top two competitors
from last season,</i>

09:49.056 --> 09:51.423
<i>Daniel Gil and Drew Drechsel,</i>

09:51.425 --> 09:53.758
<i>dual to be the fastest
on stage one.</i>

09:53.760 --> 09:55.393
- Whoo!

09:55.395 --> 09:59.230
<i>- And it's a going-away party
for Kacy Catanzaro</i>

09:59.232 --> 10:02.334
<i>as the ninja world says
good-bye to a legend.</i>

10:02.336 --> 10:05.403
- There will never be
another Mighty Kacy.

10:05.405 --> 10:08.707
<i>- When "American Ninja
Warrior" returns.</i>

10:13.245 --> 10:14.746
<i>- Welcome back to night two</i>

10:14.748 --> 10:17.148
.<i>of the national finals</i>
<i>in Las Vegas.</i>

10:17.150 --> 10:20.952
<i>While we were away, three more
ninjas took on stage one.</i>

10:20.954 --> 10:23.555
<i>Oceanside, California's
Steve Seiver</i>

10:23.557 --> 10:25.323
<i>was fired up for his
first time</i>

10:25.325 --> 10:26.658
<i>on the course in Las Vegas.</i>

10:26.660 --> 10:28.226
- Yeah!

10:28.228 --> 10:30.028
<i>- But his big group
of supporters</i>

10:30.030 --> 10:31.429
<i>had little to cheer about</i>

10:31.431 --> 10:33.798
<i>as he lost his balance
on Snake Run.</i>

10:33.800 --> 10:35.200
<i>No!</i>

10:35.202 --> 10:38.937
<i>The first obstacle,
Steve Seiver.</i>

10:38.939 --> 10:40.672
<i>Atlanta musician Craig Richard</i>

10:40.674 --> 10:42.974
<i>had his own problems
on Snake Run.</i>

10:42.976 --> 10:45.844
<i>- Ooh, get out of there.
- And though he recovered,</i>

10:45.846 --> 10:48.647
<i>his run ended seconds later
on the Propeller Bar.</i>

10:48.649 --> 10:50.115
<i>- Ooh!
- Oh!</i>

10:50.117 --> 10:51.750
<i>- Boom, he does a backflip!</i>

10:51.752 --> 10:54.986
<i>- Jeri D'Aurelio, a captain
in the Army JAG Corps,</i>

10:54.988 --> 10:57.622
<i>made it past those first
two obstacles... good</i>

10:57.624 --> 11:00.925
<i>leap there... but like many
of our athletes last week,</i>

11:00.927 --> 11:02.293
<i>she couldn't quite grab</i>

11:02.295 --> 11:04.162
<i>that second bar
on the Double Dipper.</i>

11:04.164 --> 11:05.163
<i>- Nice speed, good.</i>

11:05.165 --> 11:09.367
<i>Oh!</i>

11:09.369 --> 11:12.771
<i>- Up next is another ninja
serving our country.</i>

11:12.773 --> 11:15.774
<i>This is Coast Guard rescue
swimmer Robin Pietschmann.</i>

11:15.776 --> 11:18.543
<i>He's a five-time veteran
back in the national finals</i>

11:18.545 --> 11:20.278
<i>for the third time.</i>

11:20.280 --> 11:23.181
<i>As usual, he's got his wife,
Ashley, on the sidelines,</i>

11:23.183 --> 11:25.016
<i>but he'll also have his dad,</i>

11:25.018 --> 11:26.985
<i>who's come from
the Czech Republic</i>

11:26.987 --> 11:29.754
<i>to watch him compete
for the very first time.</i>

11:29.756 --> 11:31.589
- My dad's coming from
the other side of the world.

11:31.591 --> 11:33.758
He's coming from right
in the middle of Europe

11:33.760 --> 11:35.360
and flying to Vegas,

11:35.362 --> 11:37.929
and he's gonna cheer me on.

11:37.931 --> 11:40.331
It's gonna be awesome
to see his smile,

11:40.333 --> 11:41.766
and I know he'll be
proud of me,

11:41.768 --> 11:43.101
and he'll be excited for me.

11:43.103 --> 11:45.236
<i>Well, his dad</i>

11:45.238 --> 11:46.871
<i>doesn't speak English.</i>

11:46.873 --> 11:49.708
<i>Robin moved to America
with his mom when he was 13.</i>

11:49.710 --> 11:51.810
<i>His dad stayed behind
in the Czech Republic.</i>

11:53.980 --> 11:55.947
<i>- Pietschmann based in Hawaii
for the coast guard,</i>

11:55.949 --> 11:58.149
<i>so he's used to this
hot Vegas weather.</i>

11:58.151 --> 12:01.720
<i>- He's never made it past the
fifth obstacle on stage one,</i>

12:01.722 --> 12:04.055
<i>up quickly
on the Propeller Bar.</i>

12:04.057 --> 12:05.623
<i>- This guy jumps out
of helicopters</i>

12:05.625 --> 12:07.325
<i>as a rescue swimmer.</i>

12:07.327 --> 12:10.829
<i>- Now facing this epic new
obstacle, Double Dipper.</i>

12:10.831 --> 12:13.131
<i>This actually came from our
obstacle design challenge</i>

12:13.133 --> 12:17.669
<i>and nine-year-old Hannah W.
from Concord, California.</i>

12:17.671 --> 12:21.706
<i>- Nice, nice, perfect.</i>

12:21.708 --> 12:24.175
<i>Boy, he's got dad with
a big old smile on his face.</i>

12:24.177 --> 12:26.377
<i>- And goes right into
the Jumping Spider,</i>

12:26.379 --> 12:27.645
<i>and sticks the mount,</i>

12:27.647 --> 12:29.247
<i>now needs to stay wedged</i>

12:29.249 --> 12:32.283
<i>between the walls for
20 feet to the other side.</i>

12:32.285 --> 12:33.818
<i>- And he's got a fast pace
going,</i>

12:33.820 --> 12:36.287
<i>just under 2:00 left
to finish the course.</i>

12:36.289 --> 12:37.822
<i>- Pietschmann the first
to get through</i>

12:37.824 --> 12:41.059
<i>the Jumping Spider tonight.</i>

12:41.061 --> 12:43.928
<i>Now our first look tonight
at Parkour Run.</i>

12:43.930 --> 12:48.099
<i>Five steeply angled steps
which lead to a rope swing.</i>

12:48.101 --> 12:51.336
<i>- Ooh, watch yourself.
- Good recovery.</i>

12:51.338 --> 12:53.404
<i>- All right, good.
- He knows about saving people.</i>

12:53.406 --> 12:55.006
<i>Now he's just got
to save himself here.</i>

12:55.008 --> 12:56.107
<i>- Oh!
- Nice.</i>

12:56.109 --> 12:59.144
<i>- Got it. Good time left too.</i>

12:59.146 --> 13:01.846
<i>This is the farthest he's
ever made it on stage one,</i>

13:01.848 --> 13:04.716
<i>and he'll be the first tonight
to face the Warped Wall.</i>

13:04.718 --> 13:06.651
<i>This curved run-up
makes it more difficult.</i>

13:06.653 --> 13:08.153
<i>- Ooh.</i>

13:08.155 --> 13:10.288
<i>- The legs look real
heavy there, Akbar.</i>

13:10.290 --> 13:11.956
<i>- Yeah, you can see
he's breathing heavy. Yeah.</i>

13:11.958 --> 13:15.927
<i>- He's looking gassed but gets
up, and he'll give us</i>

13:15.929 --> 13:18.263
<i>our first look tonight
at the Domino Pipes.</i>

13:18.265 --> 13:20.598
<i>- Yeah, those pipes will fall
over like dominos</i>

13:20.600 --> 13:22.167
<i>as you run across
the top of them.</i>

13:22.169 --> 13:24.636
<i>- Got to have
precise foot placement.</i>

13:24.638 --> 13:26.070
<i>- Whoa!
- Yeah!</i>

13:26.072 --> 13:29.741
<i>- He's through, just one
more obstacle to go,</i>

13:29.743 --> 13:32.443
<i>the Flying Squirrel;
has to use those handles</i>

13:32.445 --> 13:34.813
<i>to swing all the way over
to the cargo net.</i>

13:34.815 --> 13:39.150
<i>- You got to get the
big swing, big swing.</i>

13:39.152 --> 13:41.019
<i>Oh!</i>

13:41.021 --> 13:42.720
<i>- Had plenty of time left.</i>

13:42.722 --> 13:45.824
<i>Pietschmann just misses
on the final obstacle,</i>

13:45.826 --> 13:48.693
<i>and the rescue swimmer
ends up wet.</i>

13:48.695 --> 13:50.628
<i>- He got past the fifth
obstacle, Parkour Run,</i>

13:50.630 --> 13:52.330
<i>for the first time,</i>

13:52.332 --> 13:55.366
<i>and Pietschmann looked like
he was cruising to buzzer,</i>

13:55.368 --> 13:56.868
<i>but watch his left hand.</i>

13:56.870 --> 13:58.770
<i>He just missed on the second
set of handles</i>

13:58.772 --> 14:00.138
<i>at the Flying Squirrel,</i>

14:00.140 --> 14:02.907
<i>and his season is done.</i>

14:02.909 --> 14:05.143
<i>- Up next, one of our
most exciting athletes.</i>

14:05.145 --> 14:09.180
<i>It's the Muscle Ball,
Tyler Yamauchi.</i>

14:09.182 --> 14:11.916
<i>- Wow, look out.
- This 5'1" former gymnast</i>

14:11.918 --> 14:14.485
<i>is making his
second straight appearance</i>

14:14.487 --> 14:16.187
<i>on stage one.</i>

14:16.189 --> 14:20.525
<i>Last year he had a memorable
run, but came up just short.</i>

14:20.527 --> 14:22.660
<i>- Well, you're gonna need some
Jean-Claude Van Damme</i>

14:22.662 --> 14:23.962
<i>type of splits here.</i>

14:23.964 --> 14:25.496
<i>- Ooh!
- Wow, just like that.</i>

14:25.498 --> 14:27.699
<i>- And the Muscle Ball
makes history.</i>

14:27.701 --> 14:29.300
<i>- At stage one last year,</i>

14:29.302 --> 14:31.736
<i>I set the new record for being
the shortest person</i>

14:31.738 --> 14:33.171
<i>through the Jumping Spider.</i>

14:33.173 --> 14:35.173
<i>- Keep it Gucci, Yamauchi!</i>

14:35.175 --> 14:36.741
- Got to the Warped Wall.

14:36.743 --> 14:39.210
<i>My steps were a little bit
off my first attempt.</i>

14:39.212 --> 14:42.080
<i>- Oh, just misses.</i>

14:42.082 --> 14:44.048
<i>As he just seems spent.</i>

14:44.050 --> 14:46.017
<i>- And I paid for it.</i>

14:46.019 --> 14:48.253
<i>I had no...
nothing left in the tank.</i>

14:48.255 --> 14:50.722
<i>I gassed out
on the Warped Wall.</i>

14:50.724 --> 14:52.824
This year it's different.

14:52.826 --> 14:56.327
<i>I'm doing a lot more squats,
doing a lot more</i>

14:56.329 --> 14:59.497
<i>leg conditioning, circuits,</i>

14:59.499 --> 15:02.467
<i>and a lot more
Warped Wall runs.</i>

15:02.469 --> 15:04.168
<i>I'm gonna make history again.</i>

15:04.170 --> 15:05.670
<i>I'm gonna be the shortest man</i>

15:05.672 --> 15:07.105
to ever hit the buzzer
tonight.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.877
<i>- Tyler's wife is back in
Chicago with their two kids.</i>

15:12.879 --> 15:16.347
<i>But he has his parents and
his brother and sister-in-law</i>

15:16.349 --> 15:17.548
<i>on the sidelines.</i>

15:19.686 --> 15:21.786
<i>Well, he's our shortest
male competitor.</i>

15:21.788 --> 15:23.321
<i>Even the steps of Snake Run</i>

15:23.323 --> 15:24.489
<i>can be a little more
challenging,</i>

15:24.491 --> 15:26.157
<i>but he gets through.</i>

15:26.159 --> 15:28.559
<i>- Now he needs a big bounce up
to the Propeller Bar.</i>

15:28.561 --> 15:31.596
<i>- But no problem for
the former colligate gymnast.</i>

15:31.598 --> 15:33.865
<i>He was an All-American
at the University of Illinois.</i>

15:35.702 --> 15:37.402
<i>- And check this out, Matt.</i>

15:37.404 --> 15:40.505
<i>He can barely reach up to
the bar on the Double Dipper.</i>

15:40.507 --> 15:44.909
<i>Remember, 5'1",
let that body fly.</i>

15:44.911 --> 15:46.244
<i>Nice and light, look at him.</i>

15:46.246 --> 15:48.880
<i>- Wow! He just floated
through the air.</i>

15:48.882 --> 15:51.649
<i>- Whoo!
- I want to see that again.</i>

15:51.651 --> 15:55.386
<i>Look at how high he gets.
His knees almost hit the bar.</i>

15:55.388 --> 15:58.489
<i>He nearly caught that
with his underarms.</i>

15:58.491 --> 16:02.160
<i>- Now the Jumping Spider.
- Can he do it again?</i>

16:02.162 --> 16:04.929
<i>- Matt, he's got to stretch
his 61-inch frame in</i>

16:04.931 --> 16:06.064
<i>Wow.</i>

16:06.066 --> 16:08.433
<i>- Look at that, all 61 inches.</i>

16:08.435 --> 16:12.437
<i>- And Tyler Yamauchi
is rolling here,</i>

16:12.439 --> 16:14.572
<i>plenty of time for
these final four obstacles.</i>

16:14.574 --> 16:16.841
<i>Up first, Parkour Run.</i>

16:16.843 --> 16:19.077
<i>- He's got to open his gait
here on Parkour Run.</i>

16:19.079 --> 16:21.579
<i>5'1", yes, stretch it
all the way out.</i>

16:21.581 --> 16:23.314
<i>- Great control.</i>

16:23.316 --> 16:25.483
<i>Great athleticism,
the gymnast,</i>

16:25.485 --> 16:26.985
<i>so good at body awareness,</i>

16:26.987 --> 16:29.520
<i>and now the slow roll,
gets the dismount.</i>

16:29.522 --> 16:32.323
<i>Making it look easy,
but now the moment of truth.</i>

16:32.325 --> 16:33.791
<i>It's the Warped Wall,</i>

16:33.793 --> 16:36.327
<i>the same one he couldn't
get up last season.</i>

16:36.329 --> 16:39.130
Beat that wall!
Beat that wall! Beat that wall!

16:39.132 --> 16:40.631
- Take another five or ten.
- You got plenty of time.

16:40.633 --> 16:42.967
<i>- One of his training
partners, Ethan Swanson,</i>

16:42.969 --> 16:44.435
<i>yelling out the time.</i>

16:44.437 --> 16:46.004
<i>- Yeah, he's taking a minute
to regroup,</i>

16:46.006 --> 16:47.839
<i>but you can't wait too long.</i>

16:47.841 --> 16:49.307
<i>- Down to a minute.</i>

16:49.309 --> 16:51.676
<i>- Come on, go. Nice!
- And he's got it!</i>

16:51.678 --> 16:53.378
<i>Oh, and gives it a kiss!</i>

16:53.380 --> 16:55.880
<i>Now two more obstacles to go.</i>

16:55.882 --> 16:57.915
<i>Up next, the Domino Pipes.</i>

16:57.917 --> 17:00.284
<i>- He's got to take
big strides.</i>

17:00.286 --> 17:03.121
<i>Ooh, barely even moved it.</i>

17:03.123 --> 17:04.722
<i>- Right into Flying Squirrel,</i>

17:04.723 --> 17:06.691
<i>Yamauchi leaving nothing
to chance.</i>

17:06.693 --> 17:10.595
<i>- Matt, you could see he saved
all of his energy for this.</i>

17:10.597 --> 17:14.031
<i>- Got it, and this is where
the gymnast has such</i>

17:14.034 --> 17:16.434
<i>- excellent body control.
- Are you kidding me?</i>

17:16.435 --> 17:17.734
<i>- The man known
as the Muscle Ball</i>

17:17.737 --> 17:19.904
<i>is rolling through stage one.</i>

17:19.906 --> 17:23.207
<i>- Once he got past the Warped
Wall, he turned on the jets!</i>

17:23.209 --> 17:26.810
<i>- He's the shortest athlete
to ever complete stage one,</i>

17:26.813 --> 17:29.180
<i>and he's our first
finisher tonight.</i>

17:30.817 --> 17:32.817
- I'm dry still, baby.

17:32.819 --> 17:35.253
<i>- And a message to his
three-year-old daughter,</i>

17:35.255 --> 17:37.855
<i>daddy's still dry.</i>

17:37.857 --> 17:40.058
<i>- What a difference
a year makes.</i>

17:40.060 --> 17:44.295
<i>Tyler conquers the Warped Wall
and seals it with a kiss.</i>

17:44.297 --> 17:47.131
<i>After that, he cruised
through the final obstacle,</i>

17:47.133 --> 17:50.735
<i>and the Muscle Ball
is rolling to stage two.</i>

17:50.737 --> 17:54.138
<i>- Coming up,
she's been close before.</i>

17:54.140 --> 17:56.841
<i>- Oh, just an inch.</i>

17:56.843 --> 18:00.178
<i>- Now Meagan Martin wants
to get a buzzer in Vegas.</i>

18:00.180 --> 18:02.747
- I'm gonna do everything
in my power to get there.

18:02.749 --> 18:06.617
<i>- Plus Jessie Graff's gone off
and joined the circus.</i>

18:06.619 --> 18:09.187
- It was just so amazing
to get to finally do it.

18:09.189 --> 18:12.323
<i>- See what's behind her latest
high-flying adventure</i>

18:12.325 --> 18:15.526
<i>on the national finals
of "American Ninja Warrior."</i>

18:20.599 --> 18:25.369
<i>- Jessie Graff!
- She's gonna make history!</i>

18:25.371 --> 18:26.704
. <i>- Herstory!</i>

18:26.706 --> 18:30.508
- The first woman ever
to complete stage one!

18:30.510 --> 18:33.277
<i>That was one year ago
when Jessie Graff</i>

this stage one course.</i>

18:36.583 --> 18:38.783
<i>Tonight she'll try
to do it again.</i>

18:38.785 --> 18:41.686
<i>Right now
she's with Kristine.</i>

18:41.688 --> 18:44.455
- Jessie, you were the first
woman ever to clear stage one,

18:44.457 --> 18:47.258
and then you cleared stage two
in USA Versus the World.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.527
You've done quite a lot
of things out here.

18:49.529 --> 18:51.195
How does it feel
to be back in Vegas?

18:51.197 --> 18:52.630
- It's so exciting.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.198
I was actually really nervous
a couple days ago,

18:54.200 --> 18:56.167
but being here
with all my ninja friends

18:56.169 --> 18:58.970
and seeing... this course
looks so fun,

18:58.972 --> 19:01.005
and I think I've gotten into
the right headspace,

19:01.007 --> 19:02.840
<i>and I'm just really excited
to hit the course.</i>

19:02.842 --> 19:04.375
- Well, I'm so excited to see
what you're gonna

19:04.377 --> 19:05.743
do this season.
Good luck to you.

19:05.745 --> 19:08.946
- Thank you.
- Matt and Akbar, back to you.

19:08.948 --> 19:11.182
<i>- Well, up next is another
woman who's made history</i>

19:11.184 --> 19:13.017
<i>here in Vegas.</i>

19:13.019 --> 19:15.520
<i>This is Boulder,
Colorado's Meagan Martin.</i>

19:15.522 --> 19:19.357
<i>She's a rock climber, a model,
and an all-star ninja athlete,</i>

19:19.359 --> 19:22.994
<i>and she gets her strength
from her parents.</i>

19:22.996 --> 19:24.662
- Tight feet, here we go.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.164
<i>- Hit it, hit it, hit it,
hit it, hit it, hit it.</i>

19:26.166 --> 19:28.966
<i>- It's great to be able
to look over</i>

19:28.968 --> 19:32.837
<i>and have my dad and my mom
cheering me on in every run.</i>

19:32.839 --> 19:34.038
I'm obsessed
with both my parents.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.673
I think they're so much fun.

19:35.675 --> 19:38.876
<i>Like, I would totally hang out
with them all the time,</i>

19:38.878 --> 19:40.578
<i>but they're, like, busy, like,</i>

19:40.580 --> 19:43.948
<i>being in love and, like,
doing their own thing.</i>

19:43.950 --> 19:46.083
Because my dad has
a gymnastics background,

19:46.085 --> 19:49.220
<i>he definitely understands
and respects what I do.</i>

19:49.222 --> 19:52.957
What my parents have instilled
in me is to always work hard,

19:52.959 --> 19:54.926
<i>so whether it's for
a rock climbing competition,</i>

19:54.928 --> 19:58.663
<i>my modeling career, or
for "American Ninja Warrior."</i>

19:59.732 --> 20:03.868
<i>- Wow, what return there.
- I'm excited both my parents</i>

20:03.870 --> 20:05.736
<i>will be on the sidelines
for me in Vegas</i>

20:05.738 --> 20:07.271
<i>because it gives me strength.</i>

20:07.273 --> 20:11.509
<i>- But makes it through.
- The last three years</i>

20:11.511 --> 20:13.244
<i>I've failed at stage one.</i>

20:13.246 --> 20:15.913
- The log is sliding,
and... shoot!

20:15.915 --> 20:18.216
- But I'm gonna hit
the buzzer tonight.

20:19.953 --> 20:22.720
- Come on, Meagan!
- Come on, Meggy!

20:22.722 --> 20:26.557
<i>- There's Meagan's mom and dad
back on her sidelines,</i>

20:26.559 --> 20:28.426
<i>and almost all
the other competitors</i>

20:28.428 --> 20:29.760
<i>will be watching this run.</i>

20:32.098 --> 20:33.531
<i>A couple of years ago
Meagan went farther</i>

20:33.533 --> 20:35.967
<i>than any other woman
on stage one,</i>

20:35.969 --> 20:38.803
<i>but she hasn't been able
to get past the Warped Wall.</i>

20:38.805 --> 20:40.972
<i>She believes this
will be her year.</i>

20:40.974 --> 20:43.040
<i>Now stepping up
to the Propeller Bar.</i>

20:43.042 --> 20:45.209
<i>- She's being very careful
early on.</i>

20:45.211 --> 20:46.744
<i>She needs to get moving.</i>

20:46.746 --> 20:49.647
<i>- A good jump up, oh,
but misses the rope;</i>

20:49.649 --> 20:51.515
<i>has to go around again.</i>

20:51.517 --> 20:53.050
<i>- Ooh.</i>

20:53.052 --> 20:54.986
<i>- Meagan Martin, though,
has to take another pass.</i>

20:54.988 --> 20:57.722
<i>- Oh, boy.
- Oh, boy, that's a lot of time.</i>

20:57.724 --> 20:59.390
<i>That thing is moving
in slow motion.</i>

20:59.392 --> 21:01.726
<i>- And that is so frustrating.
- But she can't panic.</i>

21:01.728 --> 21:03.127
<i>This is where having
her parents</i>

21:03.129 --> 21:05.396
<i>on the sideline
can help keep her calm.</i>

21:05.398 --> 21:08.366
- Come on, Meagan!
- You've got it. You've got it!

21:08.368 --> 21:09.800
<i>- Well, we know
she's got strength,</i>

21:09.802 --> 21:11.202
<i>but you have to get the timing
right</i>

21:11.204 --> 21:13.004
<i>on this Double Dipper.</i>

21:13.006 --> 21:14.205
<i>A little trouble getting it
started,</i>

21:14.207 --> 21:15.773
<i>and the clock ticking.</i>

21:15.775 --> 21:17.275
<i>Oh, no, uneven!</i>

21:17.277 --> 21:18.276
<i>- Ooh, sideways, sideways,
correct your body.</i>

21:18.278 --> 21:19.610
<i>oh, correct... yeah!</i>

21:19.612 --> 21:21.646
<i>- How did she save that?
- What? Oh!</i>

21:21.648 --> 21:25.082
<i>- Oh, my!
- What?</i>

21:25.084 --> 21:28.686
<i>- But she's down to 1:28,
and she needs to get going.</i>

21:28.688 --> 21:30.254
<i>Remember,
she was the first woman</i>

21:30.256 --> 21:32.189
<i>ever to get through
the Jumping Spider.</i>

21:32.191 --> 21:33.658
<i>We know she can do this.</i>

21:33.660 --> 21:35.493
<i>- And got it again,
got it again.</i>

21:35.495 --> 21:38.462
<i>- Locked in, the She-Wolf
needs to get rolling though.</i>

21:38.464 --> 21:41.032
<i>- All right.
- She can still do this,</i>

21:41.034 --> 21:43.868
<i>but she can't afford
any more mistakes.</i>

21:43.870 --> 21:46.203
<i>No time to rest
for Meagan Martin.</i>

21:46.205 --> 21:47.972
<i>Up next, Parkour Run.</i>

21:50.176 --> 21:53.110
<i>And she's down to just
a minute left</i>

21:53.112 --> 21:55.846
<i>with four obstacles
and a hesitation.</i>

21:55.848 --> 21:57.581
- Stay calm. Stay calm.

21:57.583 --> 22:00.551
I got to stay calm
for Meagan Martin here. Nice.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.787
<i>- Bounding through it.
- Nice.</i>

22:02.789 --> 22:05.423
<i>- Well, she's gonna have to
start to sell out here.</i>

22:05.425 --> 22:06.691
<i>- Yeah, she's got to go
all-in.</i>

22:06.693 --> 22:09.093
<i>She cannot miss this turn.
Ooh.</i>

22:09.095 --> 22:11.395
<i>- Oh, my, missed
the landing area.</i>

22:11.397 --> 22:14.231
<i>We saw this happen
with Jesse Labreck last week,</i>

22:14.233 --> 22:17.101
<i>and the clock just
ticking away, so frustrating.</i>

22:17.103 --> 22:19.770
<i>- Oh!
- 35 seconds.</i>

22:19.772 --> 22:21.539
<i>Well, at this point
it would be great for her</i>

22:21.541 --> 22:23.708
<i>just to beat the Warped Wall,
something she's never done.</i>

22:23.710 --> 22:26.077
- Come on!
- Now go!

22:26.079 --> 22:28.179
<i>- This is the third time
she's faced the Warped Wall</i>

22:28.181 --> 22:30.781
<i>on stage one.
She's never completed it.</i>

22:30.783 --> 22:33.651
- Meagan, you got to hurry!
<i>- Under 30 seconds.</i>

22:33.653 --> 22:35.953
<i>This may be the best
she can hope for.</i>

22:35.955 --> 22:37.788
<i>- Come on, come on, Meagan.
- Oh.</i>

22:37.790 --> 22:40.491
<i>- Oh, no.</i>
- Come on, Meagan!

22:40.493 --> 22:42.827
<i>- And a frustrating run
for the She-Wolf.</i>

22:42.829 --> 22:45.563
<i>The Propeller Bar
is where it went wrong.</i>

22:45.565 --> 22:48.866
<i>- I'd like to see her
just get up that Warped Wall.</i>

22:48.868 --> 22:50.468
<i>- Yes, she's done it!</i>

22:50.470 --> 22:52.069
<i>Well, the clock expires,</i>

22:52.071 --> 22:55.039
<i>but Meagan Martin
got up the Warped Wall.</i>

22:55.041 --> 22:57.475
- Good job!
<i>- Still a strong run.</i>

22:57.477 --> 22:59.643
<i>Two years ago that would
have been history-making,</i>

22:59.645 --> 23:01.112
<i>but tonight</i>

23:01.114 --> 23:03.180
<i>it's a disappointment
for Meagan Martin.</i>

23:03.182 --> 23:05.383
<i>- First she got hung up
on the Propeller Bar,</i>

23:05.385 --> 23:07.852
<i>and then again on Parkour Run,</i>

23:07.854 --> 23:10.054
<i>and it just ate up
too much time,</i>

23:10.056 --> 23:13.090
<i>but on the positive side,
she made it past this</i>

23:13.092 --> 23:15.860
<i>Warped Wall, further than
she's ever gone before.</i>

23:15.862 --> 23:17.862
<i>- And she's standing
by with Kristine.</i>

23:17.864 --> 23:19.697
- Meagan, I know how badly
you wanted

23:19.699 --> 23:20.998
to get up the Warped Wall.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.267
You've gone out on that,
timed out on that twice.

23:23.269 --> 23:25.336
Does that give you
any sort of satisfaction?

23:25.338 --> 23:26.837
- Oh, definitely.

23:26.839 --> 23:29.173
I'm definitely satisfied
that I got up the Warped Wall.

23:29.175 --> 23:31.909
I mean, life's about little
progresses, and, you know,

23:31.911 --> 23:34.044
I've known I could do that wall
for the last couple years,

23:34.046 --> 23:35.980
so I was happy to get there.

23:35.982 --> 23:37.615
- Well, you're always
so fun to watch,

23:37.617 --> 23:39.450
and we're very excited
to see you back next year.

23:39.452 --> 23:42.620
- Thank you.
- Guys, back to you.

23:53.266 --> 23:56.567
<i>- But now Kacy Catanzaro's
saying good-bye,</i>

23:56.569 --> 23:59.737
<i>and we're there for what
may be her final run.</i>

23:59.739 --> 24:03.407
<i>And up next, he runs

24:03.409 --> 24:05.142

<i>among the many on
the Sean Bryan bandwagon.</i>

27:19.338 --> 27:21.071
<i>As a gymnast, expect him
to control that bar,</i>

27:21.073 --> 27:22.640
<i>a little uneven.</i>

27:22.642 --> 27:24.942
<i>- Ride with the stars, baby.
- Ride with the stars.</i>

27:26.412 --> 27:28.812
<i>That was excellent work out
of Sean Bryan,</i>

27:28.814 --> 27:30.714
<i>right into the Jumping Spider.</i>

27:30.716 --> 27:32.149
<i>- Matt, it's a good thing
he's 5'10"</i>

27:32.151 --> 27:34.151
<i>because he almost didn't
make it into that chute.</i>

27:34.153 --> 27:36.687
<i>- Well, he was the fastest
in the L.A. city finals,</i>

27:36.689 --> 27:38.055
<i>and he is looking strong</i>

27:38.057 --> 27:39.823
<i>in his first attempt
on stage one,</i>

27:39.825 --> 27:42.226
<i>as he's through
the Jumping Spider.</i>

27:42.228 --> 27:44.495
- Go!
<i>- Catching his breath,</i>

27:44.497 --> 27:46.463
<i>now has to face Parkour Run.</i>

27:46.465 --> 27:49.366
- Breathe, Sean!
<i>- Najee helping his pal.</i>

27:49.368 --> 27:51.735
<i>They've competed against
each other as gymnasts.</i>

27:54.140 --> 27:55.906
<i>- Make that turn on
the Parkour Run now.</i>

27:55.908 --> 27:59.510
<i>- So smooth.
- Rock that momentum shift.</i>

27:59.512 --> 28:00.978
<i>- Getting low on the rope,</i>

28:00.980 --> 28:02.946
<i>he just missed
the landing platform.</i>

28:02.948 --> 28:04.848
<i>- Ooh, coming around
for another ride.</i>

28:04.850 --> 28:09.553
<i>- Wow, but makes it through.
- Now the Warped Wall.</i>

28:09.555 --> 28:11.221
- Good job.
<i>- That took up some time.</i>

28:11.223 --> 28:12.856
<i>That's a decent amount
of time.</i>

28:12.858 --> 28:15.826
<i>- Well, 1:13 left, and he is
looking a bit winded.</i>

28:15.828 --> 28:18.328
<i>An aggressive start
seems to have caught up</i>

28:18.330 --> 28:19.797
<i>with the Papal Ninja.</i>

28:19.799 --> 28:22.700
Beat that wall!
Beat that wall!

28:22.702 --> 28:26.503
<i>- But no problem, and his army
of followers getting excited</i>

28:26.505 --> 28:28.572
<i>as he's getting closer
to the buzzer.</i>

28:28.574 --> 28:30.374
<i>Just two obstacles left.</i>

28:30.376 --> 28:33.110
<i>Up next, the Domino Pipes.</i>

28:33.112 --> 28:35.279
<i>- He's got a physics degree
from Cal Berkeley.</i>

28:35.281 --> 28:37.214
<i>He can figure this out.</i>

28:37.216 --> 28:39.583
<i>Dancing dominos, oh,
he jumped over the last one.</i>

28:39.585 --> 28:42.553
<i>- He's got one of the biggest
crowds of the night.</i>

28:42.555 --> 28:43.921
<i>- And they are ready
to explode</i>

28:43.923 --> 28:46.123
<i>as he takes
on the Flying Squirrel.</i>

28:46.125 --> 28:48.826
<i>Control your breathing.
You're so close.</i>

28:48.828 --> 28:51.562
<i>- He makes the first grab.</i>

28:51.564 --> 28:55.899
<i>Look at the power
out of this gymnast.</i>

28:55.901 --> 28:57.568
<i>High transition.</i>

28:57.570 --> 28:59.770
<i>- Well, that gave him the time
that he needed, Matt.</i>

28:59.772 --> 29:02.439
<i>- Well, his prayers
have been answered.</i>

29:02.441 --> 29:07.277
<i>Sean Bryan, the Papal Ninja,
is moving on to stage two.</i>

29:11.317 --> 29:13.751
<i>And he finishes off
with a handstand.</i>

29:13.753 --> 29:17.488
<i>His faithful followers
are going crazy.</i>

29:17.490 --> 29:20.057
<i>His mom, just grateful.</i>

29:20.059 --> 29:22.259
<i>- Sean Bryan
started off strong,</i>

29:22.261 --> 29:24.528
<i>skipped over steps
at Snake Run,</i>

29:24.530 --> 29:26.897
<i>and went flying through
the Double Dipper,</i>

29:26.899 --> 29:29.833
<i>and with this yellow
and white crowd on their feet,</i>

29:29.835 --> 29:31.368
<i>he made it to the buzzer</i>

29:31.370 --> 29:33.771
<i>and no doubt made
the Pope proud.</i>

29:33.773 --> 29:35.773
<i>He's going to stage two.</i>

29:35.775 --> 29:38.408
<i>- And gets a round of hugs
from the family.</i>

29:38.410 --> 29:42.613
<i>Sean Bryan's making the most
of his first trip to Vegas.</i>

29:42.615 --> 29:44.181
<i>Well, in the national finals</i>

29:44.183 --> 29:46.583
<i>it's one great ninja
after another,</i>

29:46.585 --> 29:48.318
<i>and Daniel Gil is one of them.</i>

29:48.320 --> 29:51.522
<i>We'll see the Kingdom Ninja's
run a bit later,</i>

29:51.524 --> 29:54.258
<i>and we've had some drama
in earlier runs.</i>

29:54.260 --> 29:56.727
<i>- Big numbers in front of
his face. He's got to go hard.</i>

29:56.729 --> 29:59.296
<i>- In his first time
in the national finals</i>

29:59.298 --> 30:01.198
<i>Denver's Concrete Ninja,
Bart Copeland,</i>

30:01.200 --> 30:03.367
<i>made it to
the Flying Squirrel...</i>

30:03.369 --> 30:05.536
<i>- He knows it, Matt.
- He's gassed out.</i>

30:05.538 --> 30:07.771
<i>- But ran out of time.</i>

30:07.773 --> 30:09.373
<i>Oh!</i>

30:09.375 --> 30:12.176
<i>Cypress, Texas, Grant Clinton
also cut it close,</i>

30:12.178 --> 30:13.944
<i>but he made it just in time</i>

30:13.946 --> 30:17.481
<i>to join the list
of finishers on stage one.</i>

30:17.483 --> 30:19.016
<i>- That's it, baby.</i>

30:19.018 --> 30:21.585
<i>- And Minnesota's
Hunter Guerard, a rookie,</i>

30:21.587 --> 30:24.388
<i>turned in one of the fastest
times of the night.</i>

30:24.390 --> 30:25.722
<i>- Matt, now, that's a guy</i>

30:25.724 --> 30:27.858
<i>I can't wait to see
on stage two.</i>

30:27.860 --> 30:31.361
<i>- But there's more to come on
"American Ninja Warrior."</i>

30:35.600 --> 30:37.334
<i>- Welcome back to
the national finals</i>

30:37.336 --> 30:39.770
.<i>of "American Ninja Warrior."</i>

30:39.772 --> 30:41.672
<i>Our coverage tonight
is powered in part</i>

30:41.674 --> 30:43.407
<i>by Crazy Healthy
POM Wonderful.</i>

30:43.409 --> 30:45.242
<i>While we were away,</i>

30:45.244 --> 30:48.745
<i>three more athletes
took their shot at stage one.</i>

30:48.747 --> 30:52.049
<i>California's Big Ben Antoine
got big support</i>

30:52.051 --> 30:53.617
<i>from his pompom-waving mom.</i>

30:53.619 --> 30:55.519
- Go, Ben!

30:55.521 --> 30:56.987
<i>- But the engineer from Boeing</i>

30:56.989 --> 30:58.889
<i>didn't have
the right aerodynamics</i>

30:58.891 --> 31:00.090
<i>for the Double Dipper.</i>

31:00.092 --> 31:03.060
<i>- Ooh, yow, so close.</i>

31:03.062 --> 31:04.962
<i>- Ryan Souter was the only
member left</i>

31:04.964 --> 31:09.132
<i>from Utah's Souter Seven
family of competitors.</i>

31:09.134 --> 31:10.634
- Yeah!

31:10.636 --> 31:12.603
<i>- With the rest of the family
on the sidelines</i>

31:12.605 --> 31:14.304
<i>or watching on FaceTime,</i>

31:14.306 --> 31:17.808
<i>the final Souter ended his
season in the Jumping Spider.</i>

31:17.810 --> 31:19.543
<i>- Oh, no!</i>

31:19.545 --> 31:21.912
<i>- And the Souter Seven
officially all done.</i>

31:21.914 --> 31:23.447
<i>Ninja veteran Brian Arnold</i>

31:23.449 --> 31:25.215
<i>came in
with an impressive streak</i>

31:25.217 --> 31:27.618
<i>of five straight finishes
on stage one.</i>

31:27.620 --> 31:30.520
<i>- And he's having fun.
- Look at him on Double Dipper.</i>

31:30.522 --> 31:33.323
<i>- The Colorado native
made it six in a row,</i>

31:33.325 --> 31:35.959
<i>the longest current streak
among ninjas.</i>

31:35.961 --> 31:38.462
<i>He's done it!</i>

31:38.464 --> 31:40.731
- Yeah!

31:40.733 --> 31:43.467
<i>- Up next is the ultimate
walk-on warrior.</i>

31:43.469 --> 31:47.170
<i>This is Casidy Marks,
and over the past three years</i>

31:47.172 --> 31:50.274
<i>he's spent almost two months
in the walk-on line,</i>

31:50.276 --> 31:52.809
<i>13 days in Orlando
two years ago,</i>

31:52.811 --> 31:54.878
<i>24 days last year in Atlanta,</i>

31:54.880 --> 31:57.848
<i>and 19 days this year
in Daytona Beach,</i>

31:57.850 --> 31:59.349
<i>so he's thrilled
to be competing</i>

31:59.351 --> 32:00.918
<i>in the national finals</i>

32:00.920 --> 32:03.120
<i>and to be sharing
this moment with his mom.</i>

32:06.692 --> 32:08.458
<i>- I was born in Hawaii.</i>

32:08.460 --> 32:11.862
<i>My parents, you know,
weren't together all the time,</i>

32:11.864 --> 32:14.531
so, you know,
eventually they split,

32:14.533 --> 32:17.067
<i>and I left with my mom.</i>

32:17.069 --> 32:21.104
<i>She started to struggle
with her own personal issues,</i>

32:21.106 --> 32:24.274
<i>and eventually she actually
had to move my two brothers</i>

32:24.276 --> 32:27.945
<i>and I in with my grandparents
where they then raised us.</i>

32:27.947 --> 32:30.080
<i>- I was not doing well,</i>

32:30.082 --> 32:32.983
but thankfully
I have wonderful parents,

32:32.985 --> 32:35.585
and they pushed me through.

32:35.587 --> 32:37.788
<i>- She wasn't able to raise me,</i>

32:37.790 --> 32:40.123
<i>but she really turned
her life around,</i>

32:40.125 --> 32:42.960
<i>and we both have
a really great bond now.</i>

32:42.962 --> 32:45.329
- He's got a wonderful fiancee,

32:45.331 --> 32:47.864
and he's just got
a wonderful life ahead of him,

32:47.866 --> 32:51.435
<i>and I'm just so proud of him.</i>

32:51.437 --> 32:52.469
- Yeah.
- Yes.

32:52.471 --> 32:53.804
<i>- It's been a long journey,</i>

32:53.806 --> 32:56.239
<i>and to have it
come down to this,</i>

32:56.241 --> 32:58.642
<i>me competing in the finals,</i>

32:58.644 --> 33:01.311
having her cheer me on,
it means a ton.

33:05.584 --> 33:08.452
<i>- And there's mom in the
middle along with Casidy's dad</i>

33:08.454 --> 33:10.921
<i>on the left and his fiancee
on the right.</i>

33:12.658 --> 33:15.726
<i>It's always great to see
these walk-ons have success,</i>

33:15.728 --> 33:18.328
<i>and wow, he just skipped
that last step.</i>

33:18.330 --> 33:20.364
<i>Now moving on
to the Propeller Bar.</i>

33:20.366 --> 33:25.002
<i>- Well, Matt, he's 5'11"...
oh, no!</i>

33:25.004 --> 33:27.604
<i>- His first run in Vegas
is a short one.</i>

33:27.606 --> 33:31.341
<i>Casidy Marks splashes down
on the Propeller Bar.</i>

33:31.343 --> 33:33.477
<i>- He got good height
coming off the trampoline</i>

33:33.479 --> 33:35.379
<i>and got his hands over the bar</i>

33:35.381 --> 33:38.915
<i>but couldn't lock them down,
and watch this flip.</i>

33:38.917 --> 33:43.387
<i>He goes completely upside-down
as he hits the water.</i>

33:43.389 --> 33:45.589
<i>- Up next
is a ninja legend.</i>

33:45.591 --> 33:48.892
<i>It's the Godfather,
Santa Cruz, California's</i>

33:48.894 --> 33:50.994
<i>David Campbell.</i>

33:50.996 --> 33:54.131
<i>He's competed on every season
of "American Ninja Warrior"</i>

33:54.133 --> 33:56.366
<i>and was the first to build
a backyard ninja course.</i>

33:56.368 --> 33:59.169
<i>He's truly revolutionized
training for this sport,</i>

33:59.171 --> 34:00.937
<i>but in the last few years</i>

34:00.939 --> 34:04.508
<i>stage one has
been a nightmare.</i>

34:04.510 --> 34:06.710
- So the last four times
I've been in Las Vegas

34:06.712 --> 34:09.413
I've just made silly mistakes
on stage one.

34:09.415 --> 34:11.947
<i>Season four I failed
the Spinning Bridge.</i>

34:11.949 --> 34:14.751
<i>- A stumble,
David Campbell out.</i>

34:14.753 --> 34:16.485
- Season five I ended up

34:16.487 --> 34:18.188
timing out
just before the buzzer.

34:18.190 --> 34:20.956
<i>- Oh, no!
- Time's out.</i>

34:20.958 --> 34:23.060
<i>- Season six I just slipped
right off the landing pad</i>

34:23.062 --> 34:24.428
<i>of the Silk Slider.</i>

34:24.429 --> 34:27.130
<i>- Unbelievable!</i>

34:27.132 --> 34:31.568
- And season seven I just made
a short step on the Coin Flip.

34:31.570 --> 34:32.869
<i>- Oh!
- Oh, oh, go...</i>

34:32.871 --> 34:34.838
<i>- Oh, no!</i>

34:34.840 --> 34:37.107
<i>- You learn a lot more
from your failures</i>

34:37.109 --> 34:38.641
<i>than you do from winning,</i>

34:38.643 --> 34:40.877
<i>so I have learned a lot
at this point.</i>

34:40.879 --> 34:44.181
<i>- David Campbell's
stage one woes continue.</i>

34:44.183 --> 34:47.284
- Hopefully this time is an end
to that Vegas curse.

34:49.321 --> 34:50.987
- Go, David.
- Go, David.

34:50.989 --> 34:52.656
<i>- He's got some ninja
heavyweights cheering him on.</i>

34:52.658 --> 34:55.158
<i>From the right,
that's Jessie Graff,</i>

34:55.159 --> 34:56.993
<i>Brian Kretsch, James McGrath,</i>

34:56.995 --> 34:58.762
<i>and David's girlfriend,
Claire,</i>

34:58.764 --> 35:01.064
<i>all wearing the Ninja
Godfather shirts.</i>

35:03.202 --> 35:05.068
<i>- Campbell's now 39 years old.</i>

35:05.070 --> 35:06.269
<i>He's trying to prove
he can still</i>

35:06.271 --> 35:07.804
<i>run with the young fellas.</i>

35:07.806 --> 35:09.706
<i>- Well, he really changed
how ninjas trained</i>

35:09.708 --> 35:11.608
<i>with that first
backyard course.</i>

35:11.610 --> 35:13.944
<i>Many of these athletes
truly look up to him.</i>

35:13.946 --> 35:16.146
<i>This is a guy who once
set the standard</i>

35:16.148 --> 35:17.914
<i>at "American Ninja Warrior,"</i>

35:17.916 --> 35:20.984
<i>and now many are wondering if
the sport has passed him by.</i>

35:20.986 --> 35:22.586
<i>- He's made it as far
as stage three,</i>

35:22.588 --> 35:24.054
<i>but it's been a few years.</i>

35:24.056 --> 35:26.156
<i>He's trying to make
a comeback at 39.</i>

35:26.158 --> 35:27.791
<i>- And he's going
back and forth</i>

35:27.793 --> 35:29.326
<i>on how to grip
the Double Dipper.</i>

35:29.328 --> 35:30.794
- You got it, David.
- There you go.

35:30.796 --> 35:32.596
<i>- Finally settling on
his hand placement.</i>

35:32.598 --> 35:34.197
<i>- All right, here we go.</i>

35:34.199 --> 35:36.266
<i>It's a new obstacle for him,
but he knows to adjust.</i>

35:36.268 --> 35:38.168
<i>- Oh, and just makes it
to the pad.</i>

35:38.170 --> 35:41.004
<i>- That was close.
- And he knows it.</i>

35:41.006 --> 35:43.540
<i>A sigh of relief from Campbell
as he's moving on</i>

35:43.542 --> 35:45.775
<i>to the Jumping Spider.</i>

35:45.777 --> 35:48.512
<i>Godfather locks it in,
and you know deep down</i>

35:48.514 --> 35:51.781
<i>it would mean so much to him
to make it back to stage two.</i>

35:51.783 --> 35:53.216
<i>- Well, you can tell too.</i>

35:53.218 --> 35:54.885
<i>He's not as intense
as he used to be,</i>

35:54.887 --> 35:57.053
<i>I think realizing that
he's getting older and needs</i>

35:57.055 --> 35:58.955
<i>to enjoy
"American Ninja Warrior."</i>

35:58.957 --> 36:02.526
<i>- Pauses for just a moment
before taking on Parkour Run.</i>

36:05.564 --> 36:06.897
<i>Great strategy,
great technique.</i>

36:06.899 --> 36:08.331
<i>- Yup, yeah, that's probably
as clean</i>

36:08.333 --> 36:09.766
<i>as we've seen anyone
go through Parkour Run.</i>

36:09.768 --> 36:11.101
<i>- Perfect dismount.
- I want to say Campbell's</i>

36:11.103 --> 36:12.869
<i>rediscovering
his confidence here.</i>

36:12.871 --> 36:16.106
<i>- Godfather running through
stage one like a gangster.</i>

36:16.108 --> 36:18.909
<i>- And right up the wall,</i>

36:18.911 --> 36:21.711
<i>and now on to Domino Pipes,
a new obstacle,</i>

36:21.713 --> 36:23.513
<i>but he's had his trouble
on balance obstacles</i>

36:23.515 --> 36:25.015
<i>here on stage one.</i>

36:25.017 --> 36:26.917
<i>- He went out at this point
two years ago.</i>

36:26.919 --> 36:28.518
<i>- If he makes it through this,</i>

36:28.520 --> 36:30.954
<i>it will be the farthest
he's been since season five.</i>

36:30.956 --> 36:34.357
- Don't think. Come on!
- Stay on top!

36:34.359 --> 36:38.094
<i>- Campbell two obstacles away
from lifting the curse.</i>

36:38.096 --> 36:40.096
<i>- Here we go. Here we go.
- Here we go.</i>

36:40.098 --> 36:41.765
<i>- Perfect!
- Nice.</i>

36:41.767 --> 36:44.367
<i>- Oh, my, how much would this
mean to David Campbell</i>

36:44.369 --> 36:46.136
<i>to get back to stage two?</i>

36:46.138 --> 36:47.938
<i>- It ain't over
until it's over.</i>

36:47.940 --> 36:49.906
<i>- Well, we saw
42-year-old Travis Rosen</i>

36:49.908 --> 36:52.008
<i>finish the course last week.</i>

36:52.010 --> 36:56.846
<i>Can 39-year-old
David Campbell join him?</i>

36:56.848 --> 36:59.082
<i>Watch this transition,
both hands locked on.</i>

36:59.084 --> 37:00.750
<i>- Nice.
- Got it!</i>

37:00.752 --> 37:05.188
<i>- The 39-year-old, 39 seconds.
- Oh, he can smell it now.</i>

37:05.190 --> 37:07.457
<i>- Well, how much
he's put into this sport,</i>

37:07.459 --> 37:09.526
<i>how much he helped it grow,</i>

37:09.528 --> 37:13.096
<i>how great is it
to see him once again...</i>

37:13.098 --> 37:14.397
<i>- The Godfather.</i>

37:14.399 --> 37:16.766
<i>- Hitting a buzzer
on stage one.</i>

37:20.305 --> 37:21.871
- About time.

37:23.041 --> 37:26.443
<i>- David Campbell going back
to stage two</i>

37:26.445 --> 37:29.846
<i>for the first time
in five years.</i>

37:29.848 --> 37:32.682
<i>- He had a little stumble at
the end of the Double Dipper,</i>

37:32.684 --> 37:36.419
<i>but once through, he had
a smile on his face</i>

37:36.421 --> 37:38.255
<i>and coasted the rest
of the way.</i>

37:38.257 --> 37:39.823
<i>The streak is over,</i>

37:39.825 --> 37:43.727
<i>and the Godfather
is going back to stage two.</i>

37:43.729 --> 37:45.228
<i>- Coming up...
- Yeah!</i>

37:45.230 --> 37:46.796
<i>- She made history</i>

37:46.798 --> 37:50.000
<i>and inspired a new generation
of women and men.</i>

37:50.002 --> 37:51.868
- And I was like,
"You know what?

37:51.870 --> 37:53.436
If she can do it, I can do it."

37:53.438 --> 37:56.706
<i>- Now we're saying good-bye
to Kacy Catanzaro.</i>

37:56.708 --> 38:00.610
<i>Plus... oh, my goodness... he went
farther than anyone last year.</i>

38:00.612 --> 38:02.145
<i>- That's a real ninja.</i>

38:02.147 --> 38:04.814
<i>- And Drew Drechsel
wants it all this season.</i>

38:04.816 --> 38:06.449
- This is my fourth year
in Vegas.

38:06.451 --> 38:08.151
I'm gonna hit four buzzers.

38:08.153 --> 38:11.621
<i>- And later, she's a cover
girl and a ninja superstar.</i>

38:11.623 --> 38:13.356
<i>Yes!</i>

38:13.358 --> 38:16.026
<i>But now Jessie Graff's trying
out a new career</i>

38:16.028 --> 38:17.761
<i>in the circus.</i>

38:17.763 --> 38:20.130
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen,
Jessie Graff!</i>

38:20.132 --> 38:22.165
<i>- See her dream come true</i>

38:22.167 --> 38:24.434
<i>when "American Ninja Warrior"
returns.</i>

38:30.441 --> 38:32.842
<i>- Welcome back to Las Vegas
and the national finals</i>

38:32.844 --> 38:34.711
<i>of "American Ninja Warrior."</i>

38:34.713 --> 38:37.047
Well, right now, Akbar,
this is shaping up

38:37.049 --> 38:38.848
to be a history-making night.

38:38.850 --> 38:41.351
- Yeah, these are
the top ninjas,

38:41.353 --> 38:43.386
and they are tearing up
this course.

38:43.388 --> 38:47.691
Right now they are on pace for
a record number of finishers.

38:47.693 --> 38:49.492
<i>- He's gonna do it!</i>

38:49.494 --> 38:52.696
<i>- Just in the last few minutes
we've seen veteran Jamie Rahn.</i>

38:52.698 --> 38:54.164
- Yeah!

38:54.166 --> 38:56.599
<i>- A fantastic run
out of Captain NBC.</i>

38:56.601 --> 39:00.270
<i>- And nine-time ninja veteran
Ryan Stratis hit the buzzer.</i>

39:00.272 --> 39:01.705
<i>- Ryan Stratis is going back</i>

39:01.707 --> 39:03.306
<i>- to stage two.</i>
- Yeah!

39:03.308 --> 39:08.511
<i>- And our biggest ninja, 6'6"
and 215-pound Jody Avila</i>

39:08.513 --> 39:10.280
<i>also made it to the end,</i>

39:10.282 --> 39:12.716
<i>bringing the total
to 30 so far.</i>

39:12.718 --> 39:15.652
<i>- Howl, Big Dog.</i>
- Whoo!

39:15.654 --> 39:18.655
<i>- And remember, we set
the record two years ago</i>

39:18.657 --> 39:20.623
<i>with 38 finishers.</i>

39:20.625 --> 39:22.592
<i>- Dropping the hammer
on the buzzer.</i>

39:22.594 --> 39:24.661
<i>- That was the year
we had two athletes,</i>

39:24.663 --> 39:26.730
<i>Geoff Britten,
and Isaac Caldiero,</i>

39:26.732 --> 39:28.765
<i>go all the way to stage four,</i>

39:28.767 --> 39:32.168
<i>and we crowned our first-ever
million-dollar winner,</i>

39:32.170 --> 39:36.339
<i>so we may be setting up
for a big finale next week.</i>

39:36.341 --> 39:38.641
<i>- And up next may be
the top rookie</i>

39:38.643 --> 39:40.443
<i>among our women competitors.</i>

39:40.445 --> 39:43.480
<i>This is Visalia, California's
Zhanique Lovett.</i>

39:43.482 --> 39:45.882
<i>She had never competed
before this season,</i>

39:45.884 --> 39:49.619
<i>and now she's one of the 12
women finalists here in Vegas,</i>

39:49.621 --> 39:51.087
<i>and her rise in
"Ninja Warrior"</i>

39:51.089 --> 39:53.289
<i>is part of a big comeback
in her life.</i>

39:55.761 --> 39:58.261
<i>- At 17 years old I found out
I was pregnant</i>

39:58.263 --> 39:59.629
<i>with my first child.</i>

40:01.833 --> 40:03.767
<i>My daughter was 14 months old</i>

40:03.769 --> 40:07.303
<i>when her dad
decided to leave me.</i>

40:07.305 --> 40:10.673
<i>I developed an eating disorder
and became anorexic.</i>

40:12.911 --> 40:14.978
<i>It was horrible.</i>

40:14.980 --> 40:19.149
I hit rock bottom, but then
I met my future husband.

40:21.753 --> 40:23.753
- When I met Zhanique,
she had come through

40:23.755 --> 40:26.556
some pretty traumatic
experiences.

40:26.558 --> 40:28.024
<i>That's one of the things
that kind of helped us</i>

40:28.026 --> 40:31.227
<i>to bridge our friendship
into something deeper.</i>

40:31.229 --> 40:34.164
<i>- My husband encouraged me
to go to counseling.</i>

40:34.166 --> 40:36.266
<i>I slowly recovered,</i>

40:36.268 --> 40:38.902
and I started
putting that focus

40:38.904 --> 40:41.237
<i>on becoming a bodybuilder.</i>

40:43.608 --> 40:45.074
<i>When I used to look
in the mirror,</i>

40:45.076 --> 40:48.478
<i>I would see someone
that was fat and ugly.</i>

40:48.480 --> 40:51.214
<i>Now when I look in the mirror,
I see someone strong,</i>

40:51.216 --> 40:53.283
healthy, fit, and beautiful.

40:55.821 --> 40:57.787
<i>- My wife has had mountains
in front of her</i>

40:57.789 --> 40:59.322
<i>since she was a child.</i>

40:59.324 --> 41:00.924
She's gonna conquer this
because she's already conquered

41:00.926 --> 41:03.193
a lot of hurts already.

41:03.195 --> 41:04.494
<i>- Whoo.</i>

41:04.496 --> 41:06.529
<i>- I like the power
out of Zhanique.</i>

41:06.531 --> 41:08.097
<i>- I always felt like,
when I was a kid,</i>

41:08.099 --> 41:11.234
<i>that there was some type
of star in me.</i>

41:11.236 --> 41:13.670
<i>- Look at this!
- Wow.</i>

41:13.672 --> 41:17.373
- But going through all that
hell, I couldn't see it then.

41:17.375 --> 41:18.641
<i>- Look at that.
- Oh, my!</i>

41:18.643 --> 41:19.976
<i>- Oh, I like this!</i>

41:19.978 --> 41:21.544
- I feel like
"American Ninja Warrior"

41:21.546 --> 41:24.714
is showing the world
that I'm a star.

41:24.716 --> 41:27.450
<i>- Zhanique magnifique!
- Incredible.</i>

41:29.821 --> 41:31.554
<i>And there's Zhanique's
husband, Joseph,</i>

41:31.556 --> 41:32.922
<i>and the whole family,</i>

41:32.924 --> 41:34.591
<i>including their son,
Joseph Jr.,</i>

41:34.593 --> 41:38.728
<i>who was doing flips all
through her runs back in L.A.</i>

41:38.730 --> 41:40.763
<i>She's got a big group
of supporters in the stands.</i>

41:42.667 --> 41:45.935
<i>Well, Zhanique Lovett,
such a te...</i>

41:45.937 --> 41:47.704
<i>- Ooh!
- Oh, good save.</i>

41:47.706 --> 41:49.272
<i>- Don't you go out early
on me.</i>

41:49.274 --> 41:50.907
<i>Come on, Zhanique.</i>

41:50.909 --> 41:53.476
<i>- Moving on
to the Propeller Bar.</i>

41:53.478 --> 41:57.313
<i>Lovett... oh, a good one
on the Propeller Bar,</i>

41:57.315 --> 41:58.848
<i>and now this mother
of three moves up</i>

41:58.850 --> 42:00.583
<i>to take on
the Double Dipper.</i>

42:00.585 --> 42:02.685
- You got this, sis!
- You got it, babe!

42:02.687 --> 42:04.420
<i>- 5'6" and just solid muscle,</i>

42:04.422 --> 42:08.024
<i>but you got to get the timing
right on the Double Dipper.</i>

42:08.026 --> 42:09.325
<i>Finesse, finesse, finesse.</i>

42:09.327 --> 42:11.528
<i>- Oh!
- No!</i>

42:11.530 --> 42:14.864
<i>- Can't make the transfer,
and unfortunately,</i>

42:14.866 --> 42:18.134
<i>the incredible run of Zhanique
Lovett comes to an end.</i>

42:18.136 --> 42:21.004
- It's okay, babe.
<i>- Let's take another look.</i>

42:21.006 --> 42:24.240
<i>Zhanique was gripping
that first bar a little tight</i>

42:24.242 --> 42:26.009
<i>and doesn't get a good launch,</i>

42:26.011 --> 42:29.579
<i>so she can't quite reach
that second bar.</i>

42:29.581 --> 42:33.750
- I guess I gripped it wrong
or didn't let off soon enough.

42:33.752 --> 42:35.685
Shoot, that sucks.

42:35.687 --> 42:37.787
<i>- Up next is one of the most
impressive rookies</i>

42:37.789 --> 42:39.222
<i>from this season.</i>

42:39.224 --> 42:41.758
<i>This is Newnan, Georgia's
Tyler Gillett.</i>

42:41.760 --> 42:44.561
<i>He's a sandwich delivery
driver and ninja super fan</i>

42:44.563 --> 42:46.262
<i>who dreamed of competing,</i>

42:46.264 --> 42:47.797
<i>and when he turned 21
this year,</i>

42:47.799 --> 42:49.265
<i>became old enough
to compete,</i>

42:49.267 --> 42:52.235
<i>he made the most of it.</i>

42:52.237 --> 42:54.003
<i>Look at this rookie.</i>

42:54.005 --> 42:57.106
<i>- Running the course
in Daytona was amazing.</i>

42:57.108 --> 42:59.042
I've been waiting such
a long time for that moment.

42:59.044 --> 43:03.379
<i>- The 21-year-old, a run
seven years in the making.</i>

43:03.381 --> 43:05.114
<i>- I started training
for "American Ninja Warrior"</i>

43:05.116 --> 43:06.649
<i>when I was about 14.</i>

43:06.651 --> 43:10.286
Here we have me and my friend
Seth's "Ninja Warrior"

43:10.288 --> 43:12.088
training grounds.

43:12.090 --> 43:14.357
<i>It didn't really take me
too long to where I realized,</i>

43:14.359 --> 43:16.092
<i>you know, I think I can make
this into something serious</i>

43:16.094 --> 43:18.094
and really, really
start training for it.

43:18.096 --> 43:20.763
<i>- Staring down the Warped
Wall.</i>

43:20.765 --> 43:24.000
<i>Yes! He's done it!</i>

43:24.002 --> 43:26.169
<i>- Was it everything you'd
hoped it would be?</i>

43:26.171 --> 43:27.570
- No, it was better.

43:27.572 --> 43:29.505
I'm so excited right now.

43:29.507 --> 43:31.107
This is the best day
of my life.

43:33.144 --> 43:37.680
After competing in Daytona,
I had a storm come through

43:37.682 --> 43:40.516
and destroy my backyard course.

43:40.518 --> 43:43.252
There's nothing here anymore.
It's all gone.

43:43.254 --> 43:46.456
And then I had a terrible
outbreak of poison ivy

43:46.458 --> 43:50.059
and then, to top it all off,
chicken pox.

43:50.061 --> 43:51.628
<i>All of my bad luck</i>

43:51.630 --> 43:53.496
I had to get out of the way
before I got here.

43:56.368 --> 43:59.135
<i>After watching "American Ninja
Warrior" for seven years,</i>

43:59.137 --> 44:03.006
<i>to be here in Vegas,</i>

44:03.008 --> 44:05.575
<i>it's like I'm a kid
in a candy store.</i>

44:05.577 --> 44:08.444
I may be a rookie, but I see
myself on top of that mountain.

44:11.816 --> 44:14.917
<i>- There's his number-one fan,
his mom on the sidelines</i>

44:14.919 --> 44:16.919
<i>along with his sister
and some friends,</i>

44:16.921 --> 44:21.224
<i>and he's got a big crowd
in the stands from Georgia.</i>

44:24.596 --> 44:25.928
<i>It's been awesome to watch</i>

44:25.930 --> 44:27.697
<i>this new generation
of athletes</i>

44:27.699 --> 44:30.867
<i>who've grown up watching
this sport, training for it,</i>

44:30.869 --> 44:32.468
<i>just waiting to turn 21</i>

44:32.470 --> 44:34.737
<i>so they can come out here
and compete.</i>

44:34.739 --> 44:36.072
<i>- And a lot of these guys</i>

44:36.074 --> 44:37.340
<i>didn't play
traditional sports.</i>

44:37.342 --> 44:38.941
<i>They've only been
ninja training,</i>

44:38.943 --> 44:42.111
<i>and Tyler Gillett is a part
of that new generation.</i>

44:42.113 --> 44:43.846
- You got it!

44:43.848 --> 44:45.515
<i>- And now the Double Dipper.</i>

44:45.517 --> 44:47.750
<i>We've seen a lot of
more experienced athletes</i>

44:47.752 --> 44:49.519
<i>go out on this obstacle.</i>

44:49.521 --> 44:52.121
<i>- Keep it sharp, clean,
and crisp.</i>

44:52.123 --> 44:54.057
<i>- Tyler Gillett,
a confident run</i>

44:54.059 --> 44:57.260
<i>right there through
the Double Dipper.</i>

44:57.262 --> 44:58.828
<i>5'10", 165.</i>

44:58.830 --> 45:00.196
<i>- Ooh.</i>

45:00.198 --> 45:01.397
<i>- Locks in on
the Jumping Spider.</i>

45:01.399 --> 45:02.932
<i>- Can you imagine?</i>

45:02.934 --> 45:05.134
<i>This guy was delivering
sandwiches a few days ago,</i>

45:05.136 --> 45:07.236
<i>and now he's in Vegas
under the bright lights,</i>

45:07.238 --> 45:08.771
<i>and he doesn't look
worried at all.</i>

45:08.773 --> 45:10.840
<i>- And moving on
to Parkour Run.</i>

45:10.842 --> 45:13.843
<i>Two years ago it was Daniel
Gil and Thomas Stillings</i>

45:13.845 --> 45:15.545
<i>as the outstanding rookies.</i>

45:15.547 --> 45:18.247
<i>Last year it was
Josh Levin and Adam Rayl.</i>

45:18.249 --> 45:21.584
<i>Tyler Gillett trying to lead
this year's freshman class.</i>

45:21.586 --> 45:24.987
<i>- Some of the rookies can be
intimidated by stage one.</i>

45:24.989 --> 45:27.924
<i>I don't see that
intimidation in Tyler Gillett.</i>

45:27.926 --> 45:30.026
<i>- And he gets through.</i>
- Come on!

45:30.028 --> 45:33.496
- You got this!
<i>- Now the Warped Wall,</i>

45:33.498 --> 45:35.398
<i>always much tougher
with tired legs</i>

45:35.400 --> 45:37.433
<i>and this shorter,
curved run-up.</i>

45:37.435 --> 45:40.903
- First time, first time.
<i>- But no problem.</i>

45:40.905 --> 45:43.606
<i>- Started watching
when he was 14,</i>

45:43.608 --> 45:45.141
<i>and now just two obstacles
away</i>

45:45.143 --> 45:47.376
<i>from completing stage one.</i>

45:47.378 --> 45:49.045
<i>- Well, he's just breezing
through this</i>

45:49.047 --> 45:50.546
<i>very difficult course.</i>

45:50.548 --> 45:52.381
<i>- But now
the Domino Pipes.</i>

45:52.383 --> 45:54.550
<i>- Wow.
- Right through!</i>

45:54.552 --> 45:57.053
<i>Only one obstacle left.</i>

45:57.055 --> 45:59.822
<i>His family knows how much
this means to him now.</i>

45:59.824 --> 46:03.126
<i>Just needs to survive the
Flying Squirrel,</i>

46:03.128 --> 46:04.861
<i>and he's up.</i>

46:04.863 --> 46:06.229
<i>- Look at him!
- He doesn't even look tired.</i>

46:06.231 --> 46:10.299
<i>He's not panicking.
Who is this guy?</i>

46:10.301 --> 46:11.834
<i>- And he's got it!
- Nice!</i>

46:11.836 --> 46:14.003
<i>- Seven years ago he dreamed
of competing,</i>

46:14.005 --> 46:17.974
<i>and now he's living proof
that dreams come true,</i>

46:17.976 --> 46:19.976
<i>from his backyard</i>

46:19.978 --> 46:22.879
<i>to hitting a buzzer
in the national finals.</i>

46:22.881 --> 46:24.747
<i>- Oh, boy, he's gonna do it.</i>

46:24.749 --> 46:28.818
<i>- What a run by Tyler Gillett,</i>

46:28.820 --> 46:31.020
<i>this young gun.</i>

46:31.022 --> 46:33.456
<i>- Seven years of training
and dreaming,</i>

46:33.458 --> 46:35.391
<i>got your first buzzer
in Las Vegas.</i>

46:35.393 --> 46:39.929
- Yeah! Whoo!

46:39.931 --> 46:42.632
- Yeah!

46:42.634 --> 46:46.702
<i>- What emotion out of Tyler.
- He is moving on to stage two.</i>

46:46.704 --> 46:50.072
<i>- He was pumped!
- It's his first year competing,</i>

46:50.074 --> 46:52.108
<i>and he's never been
on stage one,</i>

46:52.110 --> 46:55.344
<i>but Tyler Gillett had
no problem with any of this,</i>

46:55.346 --> 46:58.047
<i>and he was lit
when he hit that buzzer.</i>

46:58.049 --> 47:00.483
<i>I love the emotion
out of the rookie.</i>

47:00.485 --> 47:02.652
<i>- He's standing by
with Kristine.</i>

47:02.654 --> 47:05.621
- Tyler, congratulations.

47:05.623 --> 47:07.957
You've been training
for this for how long?

47:07.959 --> 47:10.993
- Oh, seven years about.
- Oh, it's incredible.

47:10.995 --> 47:13.496
<i>I mean, I'm just
so blessed to be here.</i>

47:13.498 --> 47:15.765
Like, it's insane,
dream come true,

47:15.767 --> 47:18.134
and I know that I could do it.

47:18.136 --> 47:19.468
I know everybody here's
capable of doing it,

47:19.470 --> 47:21.270
but you got to be on point,

47:21.272 --> 47:22.738
so I was just praying

47:22.740 --> 47:25.174
and hoping that tonight
was my night, so...

47:25.176 --> 47:27.109
- When you started watching
"American Ninja Warrior"

47:27.111 --> 47:30.813
seven years ago, did you ever
think that this might happen?

47:30.815 --> 47:32.448
- Yeah. I mean, I envisioned
it since the first day

47:32.450 --> 47:33.916
I turned it on the TV.

47:33.918 --> 47:35.384
I was like, "I'm doing that.
I'm gonna be there,"

47:35.386 --> 47:37.086
<i>but it's all, like,
coming to fruition.</i>

47:37.088 --> 47:38.688
<i>- Well, we're really excited
for you,</i>

47:38.690 --> 47:40.456
a rookie,
an amazing performance.

47:40.458 --> 47:41.624
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

47:41.626 --> 47:44.126
- Matt and Akbar, back to you.

47:45.897 --> 47:49.999
<i>- And there's Mighty Kacy,
Kacy Catanzaro</i>

47:50.001 --> 47:52.168
<i>warming up for what
could be her final run</i>

47:52.170 --> 47:53.903
<i>on "American Ninja Warrior."</i>

47:53.905 --> 47:55.705
<i>It'll be a big moment,</i>

47:55.707 --> 47:58.040
<i>and that's coming up
in just a bit.</i>

47:58.042 --> 48:02.044
<i>Plus, Adam Rayl's lifting up
more than slabs of concrete.</i>

48:02.046 --> 48:04.080
<i>- There you go.
- This rising ninja star</i>

48:04.082 --> 48:06.249
<i>has a new number-one fan.</i>

48:06.251 --> 48:08.751
- I hope that everything that
I'm doing can keep continuing

48:08.753 --> 48:10.419
to inspire kids like him.

48:10.421 --> 48:11.854
Knuckles.

48:11.856 --> 48:14.724
<i>- When "American Ninja
Warrior" returns."</i>

48:19.029 --> 48:20.863
<i>- Welcome back to night
two of the national finals</i>

48:20.865 --> 48:22.965
.<i>of "American Ninja Warrior."</i>

48:22.967 --> 48:25.001
<i>While we were away,
three more athletes</i>

48:25.003 --> 48:27.503
<i>made their debut on stage one.</i>

48:27.505 --> 48:30.773
<i>Tucson's Rebekah Bonilla
came out with confidence.</i>

48:30.775 --> 48:33.442
<i>- Whoa! Boy, she turned
on that Snake Run.</i>

48:33.444 --> 48:35.745
<i>- But the real estate agent
couldn't get her hands</i>

48:35.747 --> 48:38.814
<i>on the Propeller Bar
and went out in style.</i>

48:38.816 --> 48:41.183
<i>Oh!</i>

48:41.185 --> 48:44.453
<i>- San Antonio's Brian
Burkhardt was going so fast</i>

48:44.455 --> 48:47.056
<i>he nearly tumbled off the
course at the Double Dipper.</i>

48:47.058 --> 48:49.292
<i>- Oh, wow.
- Good save.</i>

48:49.294 --> 48:51.827
<i>Seconds later,
the law student's season</i>

48:51.829 --> 48:53.229
<i>ended at the Jumping Spider.</i>

48:53.231 --> 48:54.263
<i>- Oh!
- Oh!</i>

48:54.265 --> 48:56.332
- No! What?

48:56.334 --> 48:59.335
<i>- After four seasons,
Massachusetts' Dave Cavanagh</i>

48:59.337 --> 49:01.137
<i>was making his first
appearance</i>

49:01.139 --> 49:02.471
<i>in the national finals.</i>

49:02.473 --> 49:04.340
<i>- Oop, stop it.
- Nice.</i>

49:04.342 --> 49:07.677
<i>- And the firefighter
absolutely torched the course,</i>

49:07.679 --> 49:11.213
<i>finishing with one of
the fastest times so far.</i>

49:11.215 --> 49:13.616
<i>What a moment,
how sweet it's got to be.</i>

49:13.618 --> 49:17.053
- Whoo! Yes! Yes!

49:17.055 --> 49:18.688
<i>- Well, our next competitor</i>

49:18.690 --> 49:21.324
<i>is one of the rising stars
of ninja competition.</i>

49:21.326 --> 49:23.893
<i>It's Phoenix concrete worker
Adam Rayl.</i>

49:23.895 --> 49:26.529
<i>He's one of only nine athletes
to hit a buzzer</i>

49:26.531 --> 49:28.364
<i>in a city finals this year,</i>

49:28.366 --> 49:30.333
<i>and while he's known
for his huge arms,</i>

49:30.335 --> 49:32.535
<i>he's also got a big heart.</i>

49:32.537 --> 49:35.037
<i>- So let's do a little bit
of jogging, okay?</i>

49:35.039 --> 49:37.173
- Okay.
- High knees, high knees.

49:37.175 --> 49:39.175
<i>A lady reached out to me
through Instagram.</i>

49:39.177 --> 49:41.177
<i>She has a nephew,
and his name is Cole,</i>

49:41.179 --> 49:42.945
and he's a super fan
of the show.

49:42.947 --> 49:45.147
Just keep moving.

49:45.149 --> 49:47.783
<i>She asked if I'd be willing
to train him for just an hour,</i>

49:47.785 --> 49:49.218
and so we pretty much
hit it off

49:49.220 --> 49:50.519
and had a great connection
right from the start.

49:50.521 --> 49:51.854
You ready
for the big-boy stuff?

49:51.856 --> 49:54.590
- Yeah.
- Pull and go. And go.

49:54.592 --> 49:56.158
- I like that
he's really strong,

49:56.160 --> 50:00.262
and he performs really good,
and he's really fast.

50:00.264 --> 50:03.566
- Cole has autism and has
anxiety issues at times.

50:03.568 --> 50:04.967
Push, push, push.

50:04.969 --> 50:06.802
<i>But when it comes
to "Ninja Warrior,"</i>

50:06.804 --> 50:09.105
<i>somehow this sport
brings out</i>

50:09.107 --> 50:12.141
<i>this focused,
motivated, happy,</i>

50:12.143 --> 50:15.144
excited kid who just wants
to just do his best.

50:15.146 --> 50:17.079
That was good. That was
the best one yet.

50:17.081 --> 50:18.147
Knuckles.

50:19.650 --> 50:23.652
<i>- And right up it.
- Oh, ho, ho.</i>

50:23.654 --> 50:25.454
<i>- He actually came
to Los Angeles,</i>

50:25.456 --> 50:27.490
<i>and he got to meet some
of his favorite ninjas,</i>

50:27.492 --> 50:28.991
<i>and I'm proud to say that now</i>

50:28.993 --> 50:31.961
<i>I'm actually
his new favorite ninja.</i>

50:31.963 --> 50:33.696
<i>- Yes!</i>

50:33.698 --> 50:35.164
<i>- It's been a pretty cool
experience,</i>

50:35.166 --> 50:36.565
and I hope that everything
that I'm doing

50:36.567 --> 50:38.834
can keep continuing
to inspire kids like him.

50:43.174 --> 50:46.575
<i>- And there's Cole
along with Adam's family,</i>

50:46.577 --> 50:48.077
<i>and that's his mom, Vicki.</i>

50:48.079 --> 50:51.080
<i>She's always a bundle
of nerves when he runs.</i>

50:51.082 --> 50:52.648
<i>And he's got his fans
from Phoenix,</i>

50:52.650 --> 50:55.117
<i>the Rayl Roadies,
here to cheer him on tonight.</i>

50:57.555 --> 51:01.290
<i>It's his second year on stage
one, bounding through it!</i>

51:01.292 --> 51:04.026
<i>- Matt, this is a top-tier
guy. He's got a background</i>

51:04.028 --> 51:06.962
<i>as a gymnast with incredible
upper body strength.</i>

51:06.964 --> 51:11.467
<i>- Last year, Adam made it to
stage two as a rookie walk-on.</i>

51:11.469 --> 51:14.503
<i>- Oh, mama looked nervous.</i>

51:14.505 --> 51:17.540
<i>Mama, don't worry. Adam Rayl
is on the next rail.</i>

51:17.542 --> 51:18.841
<i>- Good!
- Perfect.</i>

51:18.843 --> 51:19.909
<i>- Good.</i>

51:21.612 --> 51:25.214
<i>- 5'11" and 175, ready to take
on the Jumping Spider.</i>

51:25.216 --> 51:26.916
<i>He's locked in.</i>

51:26.918 --> 51:28.517
<i>Rayl looked dominant in L.A.,</i>

51:28.519 --> 51:30.386
<i>and he's coming out strong
tonight.</i>

51:30.388 --> 51:32.588
<i>- Sometimes you got to,
when you have that it factor,</i>

51:32.590 --> 51:36.258
<i>and we believe that Adam Rayl
is a strong competitor</i>

51:36.260 --> 51:38.327
<i>and could make it
all the way to stage four.</i>

51:38.329 --> 51:40.262
<i>- Steps down to Parkour Run,</i>

51:40.264 --> 51:42.465
<i>and this one's got mom
a little nervous.</i>

51:42.467 --> 51:43.766
<i>Agility obstacles can take out</i>

51:43.768 --> 51:46.202
<i>even the strongest
competitors.</i>

51:46.204 --> 51:50.606
<i>- Whoo. The Parkour...
- Oh, no! What a save!</i>

51:50.608 --> 51:52.808
<i>Oh, my, that upper body
locked around</i>

51:52.810 --> 51:56.946
<i>that fourth stand
and flirting with disaster.</i>

51:56.948 --> 52:01.050
<i>- Whoo.
- But he survives.</i>

52:01.052 --> 52:03.119
<i>Gave his buddy Cole
a scare there,</i>

52:03.121 --> 52:04.520
<i>but now it's the Warped Wall.</i>

52:04.522 --> 52:06.655
Beat that wall!

52:06.657 --> 52:08.624
<i>- Rayl, though, the clock
continues to tick,</i>

52:08.626 --> 52:10.693
<i>three obstacles left,</i>

52:10.695 --> 52:12.361
<i>but now he's up.</i>

52:12.363 --> 52:14.930
<i>Oh, and look at the gymnast
just roll through it.</i>

52:14.932 --> 52:17.933
<i>- Mama can feel it.
- He's only two obstacles away.</i>

52:17.935 --> 52:19.301
<i>- And that's his aunt.</i>

52:19.303 --> 52:21.237
<i>She's as stressed out
as mom is.</i>

52:21.239 --> 52:23.105
<i>He nearly fell on Parkour Run,</i>

52:23.107 --> 52:25.608
<i>and now he's got one
last agility obstacle,</i>

52:25.610 --> 52:27.610
<i>the Domino Pipes.</i>

52:27.612 --> 52:29.411
<i>- Domino dancing here,
domino dancing.</i>

52:29.413 --> 52:30.880
<i>- Yes!
- Domino, yeah!</i>

52:30.882 --> 52:33.149
<i>- And right into it,
no hesitation.</i>

52:33.151 --> 52:34.483
<i>Watch this transfer.</i>

52:34.485 --> 52:37.119
<i>The gymnast getting
good power.</i>

52:37.121 --> 52:40.856
<i>- Get up. Get up high.
- Got it.</i>

52:40.858 --> 52:42.825
<i>- And we may need a medic
for his family.</i>

52:42.827 --> 52:44.827
<i>They are going crazy
on the sidelines.</i>

52:44.829 --> 52:47.830
<i>- Look at these swings, Matt.
- Are you kidding me?</i>

52:47.832 --> 52:49.565
<i>He may fly right over
the cargo net.</i>

52:49.567 --> 52:52.902
<i>- Big transfer.
- Whoo.</i>

52:52.904 --> 52:55.237
<i>- Adam Rayl, well,</i>

52:55.239 --> 52:57.773
<i>near-disaster
on the Parkour Run.</i>

52:57.775 --> 53:01.177
<i>Instead, he's going on
to stage two!</i>

53:07.485 --> 53:10.753
<i>- You know what? He had
a close call on Parkour Run,</i>

53:10.755 --> 53:12.755
<i>nearly gave his mom
a heart attack,</i>

53:12.757 --> 53:15.958
<i>but then he rolled through
the final few obstacles,</i>

53:15.960 --> 53:20.596
<i>and Adam Rayl is
going back to stage two.</i>

53:20.598 --> 53:23.532
<i>- And the Rayl family
can finally relax;</i>

53:23.534 --> 53:26.235
<i>Adam's moving on.</i>

53:26.237 --> 53:29.572
<i>Well, get ready.
It's time for Jessie Graff.</i>

53:29.574 --> 53:30.973
<i>The woman who made history</i>

53:30.975 --> 53:33.542
<i>is about to make her way
to the start line,</i>

53:33.544 --> 53:36.445
<i>and we'll see her run
right after this break.</i>

53:36.447 --> 53:38.714
<i>And it's gonna be
an all-star finish here</i>

53:38.716 --> 53:41.450
<i>on stage one
with Kacy Catanzaro...</i>

53:41.452 --> 53:44.253
<i>- Whoo!
- Daniel Gil...</i>

53:44.255 --> 53:45.955
<i>- Here comes
the Kingdom Ninja.</i>

53:45.957 --> 53:47.556
<i>- Najee Richardson...</i>

53:47.558 --> 53:50.859
<i>- That was crazy.
- And Drew Drechsel.</i>

53:50.861 --> 53:52.861
<i>The fastest time
of the night.</i>

53:52.863 --> 53:56.198
<i>When "American Ninja Warrior"
returns.</i>

54:00.070 --> 54:01.904
<i>- Welcome back to Las Vegas
and the second night</i>

54:01.906 --> 54:03.606
.<i>of our national finals.</i>

54:03.608 --> 54:06.008
<i>While we were away,
three more athletes tried</i>

54:06.010 --> 54:08.110
<i>to keep their season alive.</i>

54:08.112 --> 54:10.446
<i>Kansas City tuba player Alex
Carson</i>

54:10.448 --> 54:12.248
<i>was cruising through
his first</i>

54:12.250 --> 54:13.616
<i>run on stage one</i>

54:13.618 --> 54:15.851
<i>until he reached
the Domino Pipes.</i>

54:15.853 --> 54:18.020
<i>- Oh, go for a ride!</i>

54:18.022 --> 54:20.489
<i>- The engineer managed
to save himself</i>

54:20.491 --> 54:22.958
<i>but had nothing left
for the Flying Squirrel.</i>

54:22.960 --> 54:26.528
<i>- He is gassed.
- Look at him. No!</i>

54:26.530 --> 54:28.998
<i>- Four-time ninja veteran
Karson Voiles</i>

54:29.000 --> 54:31.033
<i>ran into trouble on
Parkour Run.</i>

54:31.035 --> 54:32.935
<i>- Ooh!
- Good save.</i>

54:32.937 --> 54:35.971
<i>- But the Utah father
of two finished strong</i>

54:35.973 --> 54:37.406
<i>and made it to the buzzer,</i>

54:37.408 --> 54:39.541
<i>dedicating his run
to his two daughters.</i>

54:39.543 --> 54:43.112
- I love you, baby girls.
- That was for you.

54:43.114 --> 54:45.114
<i>- The Giant, Jon Alexis Jr.,</i>

54:45.116 --> 54:48.017
<i>was gunning for the obstacle
that took him out last year,</i>

54:48.019 --> 54:49.485
<i>the Flying Squirrel.</i>

54:49.487 --> 54:51.820
<i>Waited a year for this moment.</i>

54:51.822 --> 54:54.490
<i>And the 6'6" veteran
got his revenge</i>

54:54.492 --> 54:57.326
<i>and hit his first buzzer
in Vegas.</i>

54:57.328 --> 54:59.261
<i>Moving on to stage two.</i>

54:59.263 --> 55:00.729
- Hey, having fun with it.

55:02.700 --> 55:05.000
<i>- And hoping to keep
the winning streak</i>

55:05.002 --> 55:07.770
<i>going on stage one
is Kyle Mendoza,</i>

55:07.772 --> 55:10.839
<i>the FedEx delivery driver
from St. Charles, Missouri.</i>

55:10.841 --> 55:12.174
<i>- Oh, he's spinning.
- Whoa!</i>

55:12.176 --> 55:14.443
<i>- This guy's definitely
got some skills,</i>

55:14.445 --> 55:16.512
<i>and it's moves like that
that have made him</i>

55:16.514 --> 55:17.980
<i>a viral sensation.</i>

55:19.750 --> 55:21.550
<i>- My nickname
is the FedEx Ninja.</i>

55:21.552 --> 55:24.420
<i>- Wow!
- This guy is fun to watch.</i>

55:24.422 --> 55:26.021
- I've been working for FedEx

55:26.023 --> 55:29.091
for about three years now,
and I'm always on the move.

55:29.093 --> 55:30.759
Online I'm known as "Epic."

55:32.563 --> 55:35.864
<i>I have more than 140,000
followers on YouTube.</i>

55:35.866 --> 55:37.800
Recently I started a new series
on my YouTube channel

55:37.802 --> 55:39.902
called Epic Family Adventures.

55:39.904 --> 55:42.004
<i>My wife does aerial silks.</i>

55:42.006 --> 55:44.139
<i>Yeah. My daughter
loves to climb.</i>

55:44.141 --> 55:45.541
<i>Good job, Briley.</i>

55:45.543 --> 55:47.743
I also turned my dog
into a YouTube sensation.

55:47.745 --> 55:50.412
Jump up, and wall flip,
wall flip. Good girl.

55:50.414 --> 55:51.780
And all my fans
and followers,

55:51.782 --> 55:53.649
they're gonna be
very excited to watch.

55:53.651 --> 55:55.617
<i>You better buckle
your seatbelts.</i>

55:55.619 --> 55:57.853
I'm gonna have an epic run
out on stage one.

56:00.424 --> 56:02.324
<i>- Well, his daughter and
his dog</i>

56:02.326 --> 56:03.659
<i>are watching from home,</i>

56:03.661 --> 56:04.860
<i>but he's throwing his heart</i>

56:04.862 --> 56:06.195
<i>out to his to his wife,
Ashley,</i>

56:06.197 --> 56:07.496
<i>who's cheering
from the sideline.</i>

56:07.498 --> 56:08.997
<i>It's his first time here.</i>

56:10.835 --> 56:13.302
<i>But Mendoza always goes
all out.</i>

56:13.304 --> 56:16.705
<i>- Wow, you see that beginning?
- He just cut right through it.</i>

56:16.707 --> 56:18.540
<i>- And right onto
the Propeller Bar,</i>

56:18.542 --> 56:20.576
<i>and directly to the rope.</i>

56:20.578 --> 56:22.444
<i>Living
dangerously already.</i>

56:22.446 --> 56:25.047
<i>- He's reckless.</i>
- Good recovery, babe.

56:25.049 --> 56:26.949
<i>- But remember,
this is his first time</i>

56:26.951 --> 56:28.384
<i>on all these obstacles,</i>

56:28.386 --> 56:30.819
<i>may want to pause
and take a breath.</i>

56:30.821 --> 56:33.622
<i>- Oh, well, you know,
FedEx's motto is... oh!</i>

56:33.624 --> 56:35.357
<i>Air ball! Air ball!</i>

56:35.359 --> 56:37.559
<i>- Well, he went all out,
and it cost him.</i>

56:37.561 --> 56:39.261
- It's all right, babe.

56:39.263 --> 56:42.331
<i>- Unfortunately, that delivery
is not gonna make it.</i>

56:42.333 --> 56:44.700
<i>Kyle Mendoza out
on the Double Dipper.</i>

56:44.702 --> 56:47.269
<i>- Watch this sweet move
on the Propeller Bar.</i>

56:47.271 --> 56:50.005
<i>He jumps up
and doesn't swing around.</i>

56:50.007 --> 56:52.074
<i>He immediately grabs the rope.</i>

56:52.076 --> 56:54.476
<i>That's a risky move,
but it worked.</i>

56:54.478 --> 56:57.379
<i>But on the Double Dipper
his timing was off,</i>

56:57.381 --> 56:59.515
<i>only one hand out in front,</i>

56:59.517 --> 57:01.517
<i>and he's not even close
to that second bar.</i>

57:01.519 --> 57:06.622
Jessie! Jessie! Jessie!
Jessie! Jessie!

57:07.425 --> 57:11.293
<i>- Up next is maybe the biggest
ninja star on the planet.</i>

57:11.295 --> 57:14.129
<i>It's the stuntwoman
from Calabasas, California,</i>

57:14.131 --> 57:16.031
<i>Jessie Graff.</i>

57:16.033 --> 57:18.434
<i>And what a year she has had.</i>

57:18.436 --> 57:20.102
<i>A year ago she became
the first woman</i>

57:20.104 --> 57:21.637
<i>to finish stage one.</i>

57:21.639 --> 57:24.907
<i>Then in our USA Versus
the World competition</i>

57:24.909 --> 57:27.509
<i>she became the first
to finish stage two,</i>

57:27.511 --> 57:30.546
<i>and she has become
an international celebrity.</i>

57:30.548 --> 57:32.381
<i>In fact, she's on the cover
of this month's</i>

57:32.383 --> 57:34.316
<i>"Women's Health" magazine.</i>

57:34.318 --> 57:36.151
<i>And Jessie even got to fulfill</i>

57:36.153 --> 57:37.986
<i>another lifelong dream
this year.</i>

57:37.988 --> 57:40.689
<i>She ran away
and joined the circus.</i>

57:40.691 --> 57:44.326
- Ready, look up.
- Hup.

57:46.130 --> 57:49.498
And tuck, one, two.

57:49.500 --> 57:50.566
All right, all the way out.

57:52.703 --> 57:55.003
<i>- Ever since I was four
years old I had a bag packed</i>

57:55.005 --> 57:56.805
so that if I ever got
the opportunity

57:56.807 --> 57:58.740
to join the circus,
I could do it.

58:00.744 --> 58:03.412
- So she wrote a letter
to the circus...

58:05.549 --> 58:07.549
- And they actually
wrote her back,

58:07.551 --> 58:09.551
said that she'd have to wait
till she got older.

58:09.553 --> 58:11.119
<i>She was only about ten.</i>

58:11.121 --> 58:12.554
- It was a sad day.

58:12.556 --> 58:15.357
- But Jessie never gave up
on the circus.

58:15.359 --> 58:17.726
<i>- This crowd is on its feet.</i>

58:17.728 --> 58:20.863
- And "American Ninja Warrior"
kept all that alive for her.

58:20.865 --> 58:23.165
<i>- Jessie has experience
on the trapeze bars.</i>

58:23.167 --> 58:24.900
<i>- With all the swing
and the release</i>

58:24.902 --> 58:26.635
<i>and the risk and the balance</i>

58:26.637 --> 58:28.670
and the sense
of accomplishment.

58:28.672 --> 58:32.674
<i>- Jessie Graff has done it!</i>

58:32.676 --> 58:35.177
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

58:35.179 --> 58:36.245
- I would like to join
the circus, please.

58:36.247 --> 58:37.646
- All right, come on in.

58:37.648 --> 58:39.147
- Okay!

58:39.149 --> 58:41.049
That was way easier
than I expected.

58:41.051 --> 58:42.384
<i>- And now she got a chance</i>

58:42.386 --> 58:44.887
to actually perform
with the circus.

58:44.889 --> 58:46.288
- Hup!

58:46.290 --> 58:48.156
<i>- I had a couple weeks
to prepare.</i>

58:48.158 --> 58:50.759
- Flat, hup. There you go.

58:50.761 --> 58:52.528
<i>- I wanted to try new tricks,</i>

58:52.530 --> 58:54.496
<i>but they kept me focused on,
like, "Hey, you're performing.</i>

58:54.498 --> 58:57.032
This is the trick you're doing.
Let's get it clean."

58:59.970 --> 59:03.438
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, Jessie Graff!</i>

59:06.544 --> 59:13.615
<i>♪ ♪</i>

59:20.357 --> 59:24.059
<i>- I'd never performed
flying trapeze before.</i>

59:24.061 --> 59:26.028
It was that dream that I'd had
since I was four years old,

59:26.030 --> 59:28.730
and it was just so amazing
to get to finally do it.

59:28.732 --> 59:30.165
<i>- Let's hear it for Jessie!</i>

59:30.167 --> 59:31.667
- Someday I still want
to travel

59:31.669 --> 59:33.969
with the circus, but not today.

59:33.971 --> 59:35.771
Jessie! Jessie!

59:35.773 --> 59:37.973
<i>- Well, you know, everyone
in Vegas</i>

59:37.975 --> 59:39.575
<i>is gonna be watching
this run,</i>

59:39.577 --> 59:41.777
<i>including Jessie's mom
and all the other ninjas,</i>

59:41.779 --> 59:43.712
<i>including friend
Maggi Thorne...</i>

59:43.714 --> 59:45.380
- Let's go, Jessie!
<i>- And there's Allyssa Beird,</i>

59:45.382 --> 59:47.616
<i>who followed her and
became the second woman</i>

59:47.618 --> 59:49.918
<i>to finish stage one last week.</i>

59:49.920 --> 59:52.421
<i>Jessie will not overlook
this first obstacle.</i>

59:54.024 --> 59:56.992
<i>She fell here in our USA
Versus the World competition,</i>

59:56.994 --> 01:00:00.495
<i>so she's gonna be careful.
And it pays off.</i>

01:00:00.497 --> 01:00:02.130
<i>- Well, now she can let loose.</i>

01:00:02.132 --> 01:00:07.202
<i>- Now it's the Propeller Bar,
and what a strong jump.</i>

01:00:07.204 --> 01:00:09.605
<i>- Strong grip too.
- She's got a smile on her.</i>

01:00:09.607 --> 01:00:11.406
<i>Just look at that.</i>

01:00:11.408 --> 01:00:14.109
<i>- We love watching
Jessie Graff compete,</i>

01:00:14.111 --> 01:00:16.478
<i>but now it's the unforgiving
Double Dipper.</i>

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.080
- Come on, Jess! Come on, Jess!

01:00:18.082 --> 01:00:20.816
<i>- This took out her friend,
Maggi Thorne, last week.</i>

01:00:20.818 --> 01:00:23.352
<i>- And we just saw her flying
on the circus trapeze.</i>

01:00:23.354 --> 01:00:26.755
<i>Needs to use
those skills right here.</i>

01:00:26.757 --> 01:00:28.390
<i>- Look at this.
- Great job.</i>

01:00:28.392 --> 01:00:29.391
<i>- Look at that, just flying
through the air.</i>

01:00:29.393 --> 01:00:30.425
<i>- So easy.</i>

01:00:30.427 --> 01:00:33.829
- Yes!
- Yes! Yes!

01:00:33.831 --> 01:00:36.832
<i>- Now on to
the Jumping Spider.</i>

01:00:36.834 --> 01:00:37.899
<i>Locked in!</i>

01:00:39.703 --> 01:00:42.070
<i>This woman trains so many
different disciplines:</i>

01:00:42.072 --> 01:00:43.905
<i>of course,
a pole vaulter in college,</i>

01:00:43.907 --> 01:00:46.208
<i>stuntwoman, does parkour,
rock climbing.</i>

01:00:46.210 --> 01:00:48.877
<i>- Matt, I think we're gonna
see her again on stage two.</i>

01:00:48.879 --> 01:00:52.014
Jess! 1:40, 1:40!

01:00:52.016 --> 01:00:54.449
<i>- Maggi Thorne shouting
the time to Jessie.</i>

01:00:54.451 --> 01:00:57.219
<i>Up next, Parkour Run.</i>

01:00:57.221 --> 01:00:58.854
<i>Meagan Martin got
hung up here earlier.</i>

01:00:58.856 --> 01:01:02.624
<i>Jessie Labreck
struggled on it last week.</i>

01:01:02.626 --> 01:01:04.426
<i>- She's a stuntwoman.
- She knows what she's doing.</i>

01:01:04.428 --> 01:01:07.195
<i>- A little high on the rope.
- Get it. Nice.</i>

01:01:07.197 --> 01:01:09.464
<i>- But locks it in.
- Boy, she sees it,</i>

01:01:09.466 --> 01:01:11.299
<i>calculates it,
and just goes.</i>

01:01:11.301 --> 01:01:13.001
<i>- Now the Warped Wall.</i>
- Beat that wall!

01:01:13.003 --> 01:01:16.772
- Jessie Graff, not many have
been faster to this point,

01:01:16.774 --> 01:01:19.307
and that's what I love
about this woman.

01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:22.310
She competes with
the best man or woman.

01:01:22.312 --> 01:01:24.579
<i>- Matt, I like to see her take
a rest on the top.</i>

01:01:24.581 --> 01:01:26.048
<i>That's it.</i>

01:01:26.050 --> 01:01:27.916
<i>- And right up it.</i>

01:01:27.918 --> 01:01:30.886
<i>Now another agility test
in the Domino Pipes.</i>

01:01:30.888 --> 01:01:32.621
<i>- I'm watching
that clock, Matt.</i>

01:01:32.623 --> 01:01:34.556
- Come on, Jessie!
- Come on, Jessie!

01:01:34.558 --> 01:01:36.491
<i>- Two obstacles away
from joining Allyssa Beird</i>

01:01:36.493 --> 01:01:39.294
<i>on stage two.</i>

01:01:39.296 --> 01:01:42.064
<i>- And she's got it!</i>
- Whoo!

01:01:42.066 --> 01:01:44.099
<i>- This is why she is
big-time prime time.</i>

01:01:44.101 --> 01:01:48.070
<i>- One obstacle away,
the Flying Squirrel,</i>

01:01:48.072 --> 01:01:50.572
<i>and what an accomplishment
this would be.</i>

01:01:50.574 --> 01:01:54.176
<i>Jessie Graff trying to finish
stage one two years in a row.</i>

01:01:54.178 --> 01:01:57.979
<i>- And just like on the circus
trapeze, she is locked in.</i>

01:01:57.981 --> 01:01:59.848
<i>- And look at the power
out of Graff.</i>

01:01:59.850 --> 01:02:01.450
<i>- Ooh, get up there.</i>

01:02:01.452 --> 01:02:05.954
<i>- One more swing to go,
about 25 seconds left.</i>

01:02:05.956 --> 01:02:10.692
- No! No! Oh, no!
- What?

01:02:10.694 --> 01:02:14.229
<i>- And a reminder that even
Jessie Graff is human.</i>

01:02:14.231 --> 01:02:15.564
- What happened?

01:02:15.566 --> 01:02:16.732
<i>- Looked like she was
on her way</i>

01:02:16.734 --> 01:02:18.567
<i>to a second straight finish,</i>

01:02:18.569 --> 01:02:21.870
<i>but even the greats
will stumble.</i>

01:02:21.872 --> 01:02:25.173
<i>- Just like last year,
she's got a smile on her face.</i>

01:02:25.175 --> 01:02:26.842
<i>Looked like she was home free,</i>

01:02:26.844 --> 01:02:29.111
<i>but she came up a little
short on the swing.</i>

01:02:29.113 --> 01:02:30.712
<i>Look at this.</i>

01:02:30.714 --> 01:02:33.181
<i>She had her hands on the net
but couldn't hang on.</i>

01:02:33.183 --> 01:02:34.783
<i>- And right now
Jessie's standing by</i>

01:02:34.785 --> 01:02:37.853
<i>with Kristine for the POM
Post-Run Interview.</i>

01:02:37.855 --> 01:02:40.522
- Jessie, this is
really surprising.

01:02:40.524 --> 01:02:42.491
- Can you believe
I just did that?

01:02:42.493 --> 01:02:44.826
- No, I... because I know
that you can do it.

01:02:44.828 --> 01:02:45.894
I've seen you do it before.

01:02:45.896 --> 01:02:48.130
What happened?
What went wrong?

01:02:48.132 --> 01:02:49.831
- You know, I was feeling
really good.

01:02:49.833 --> 01:02:53.201
I think I could have pumped
more on that swing, obviously.

01:02:53.203 --> 01:02:56.605
I just remembered last year
not being... that's what it was.

01:02:56.607 --> 01:02:58.240
I got confident.

01:02:58.242 --> 01:03:01.343
<i>I was so high and had
so much distance last year,</i>

01:03:01.345 --> 01:03:04.312
<i>and so I thought I had enough
swing and went for it,</i>

01:03:04.314 --> 01:03:07.682
and I was like, "There it is.
Oh, there it goes."

01:03:07.684 --> 01:03:10.652
But it's... like, you know, what
I always say is overconfidence

01:03:10.654 --> 01:03:12.287
<i>is the number-one
ninja killer.</i>

01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:13.955
<i>I thought I had it,
and that's why I didn't.</i>

01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:16.124
- You're always so much fun
to watch. Thank you.

01:03:16.126 --> 01:03:17.826
- Thank you.
- Guys?

01:03:19.163 --> 01:03:23.632
<i>- Coming up, no one flies
like the Phoenix.</i>

01:03:23.634 --> 01:03:25.934
<i>- He's all the way turnt up!</i>

01:03:25.936 --> 01:03:30.105
<i>- Now Najee Richardson wants
to fly even higher in Vegas.</i>

01:03:30.107 --> 01:03:32.440
- The Phoenix is going to fly
to the top of Mount Midoriyama.

01:03:32.442 --> 01:03:34.943
- Yeah!
<i>- We'll see his run</i>

01:03:34.945 --> 01:03:37.379
<i>when "American Ninja Warrior"
returns.</i>

01:03:41.884 --> 01:03:43.418
<i>- Welcome back to Las Vegas
and night two</i>

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:45.320
<i>of the national finals.</i>

01:03:45.322 --> 01:03:47.122
<i>While we were away,
three more athletes</i>

01:03:47.124 --> 01:03:50.325
<i>got their chance
to take on stage one.</i>

01:03:50.327 --> 01:03:52.160
<i>Rookie Sara "Beastin'" Heesen</i>

01:03:52.162 --> 01:03:54.262
<i>had one of the largest
cheering sections.</i>

01:03:54.264 --> 01:03:55.997
- Come on, Sara!

01:03:55.999 --> 01:03:58.900
<i>- The Minnesota bartender
made it to the Propeller Bar,</i>

01:03:58.902 --> 01:04:01.303
<i>where she added
a splash of water.</i>

01:04:01.305 --> 01:04:03.205
<i>- Ooh!
- Oh, no!</i>

01:04:03.207 --> 01:04:05.841
<i>- The Science Ninja,
University of Kansas</i>

01:04:05.843 --> 01:04:07.576
<i>grad student Mitch Vedepo,</i>

01:04:07.578 --> 01:04:10.312
<i>went farther than anyone
in the Kansas City finals.</i>

01:04:10.314 --> 01:04:11.546
<i>- Get it! Get it!</i>

01:04:11.548 --> 01:04:13.148
<i>- Whoo!
- Real slow.</i>

01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:15.517
<i>But tonight,
for the second year in a row,</i>

01:04:15.519 --> 01:04:17.853
<i>his season ended
with the Jumping Spider.</i>

01:04:17.855 --> 01:04:19.487
<i>- Come on. Stick it.
- Oh, no!</i>

01:04:19.489 --> 01:04:21.923
<i>- Oh, again?</i>

01:04:21.925 --> 01:04:24.626
<i>- Three-time ninja veteran
Nicholas Coolridge</i>

01:04:24.628 --> 01:04:26.328
<i>was making his third
straight appearance</i>

01:04:26.330 --> 01:04:28.029
<i>in the national finals.</i>

01:04:28.031 --> 01:04:29.731
<i>- He's working it like a boss.</i>

01:04:29.733 --> 01:04:33.201
<i>- And the Venice, California
acrobat made it look easy,</i>

01:04:33.203 --> 01:04:36.504
<i>becoming the 36th finisher
here on stage one.</i>

01:04:36.506 --> 01:04:38.340
<i>- I can't wait to see him</i>

01:04:38.342 --> 01:04:40.842
<i>- on stage two.</i>
- Yes, whoo!

01:04:40.844 --> 01:04:43.678
<i>- Coolridge is acrobatic,
but our next athlete</i>

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:45.780
<i>can really fly.</i>

01:04:45.782 --> 01:04:48.350
<i>This is the Phoenix,
Najee Richardson.</i>

01:04:48.352 --> 01:04:50.385
<i>The former gymnast really
blew up last season,</i>

01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:52.487
<i>making it to stage two.</i>

01:04:52.489 --> 01:04:53.989
<i>This year he's taken
his training</i>

01:04:53.991 --> 01:04:56.858
<i>to a whole new level
and a whole new city.</i>

01:04:58.262 --> 01:05:01.529
- Stop.
- Come on, don't eat one!

01:05:01.531 --> 01:05:03.598
<i>- This season I had a talk
with my girlfriend,</i>

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.333
and we decided to move
in together

01:05:05.335 --> 01:05:08.670
<i>five minutes from the gym</i>

01:05:08.672 --> 01:05:10.672
<i>so that I could really
focus on my passion,</i>

01:05:10.674 --> 01:05:13.375
<i>which has become
"American Ninja Warrior."</i>

01:05:13.377 --> 01:05:16.378
- Yeah, man.
<i>- I train in the morning,</i>

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:18.546
<i>and I teach classes
of ninja warrior.</i>

01:05:18.548 --> 01:05:19.981
Yeah!

01:05:19.983 --> 01:05:21.716
And then I train
a little bit again.

01:05:21.718 --> 01:05:24.386
- It's slippery.
- Nice. Good, man.

01:05:25.322 --> 01:05:28.056
<i>- I watch how hard
he works every day</i>

01:05:28.058 --> 01:05:29.925
<i>and how many hours he trains,</i>

01:05:29.927 --> 01:05:32.994
<i>and I've never seen
anything like it.</i>

01:05:32.996 --> 01:05:35.363
To see him get what
he's been working for,

01:05:35.365 --> 01:05:37.666
I can't wait to see it.

01:05:37.668 --> 01:05:40.835
<i>- Ooh, come on, Najee warrior.
- He sticks it.</i>

01:05:40.837 --> 01:05:44.506
- I'm running for everyone
who has just stood by me

01:05:44.508 --> 01:05:48.476
throughout my life,
my parents, my girlfriend.

01:05:48.478 --> 01:05:51.012
<i>- Here we go.</i>

01:05:51.014 --> 01:05:52.380
<i>- I just want to say
thank you,</i>

01:05:52.382 --> 01:05:55.083
<i>and this is my way
of doing it.</i>

01:05:55.085 --> 01:05:58.420
Tonight the Phoenix is gonna
rise to the top of stage one.

01:05:58.422 --> 01:06:00.288
Yeah!

01:06:01.258 --> 01:06:03.692
<i>- And there's McKenzie.
- She'll be on the sideline</i>

01:06:03.694 --> 01:06:06.394
<i>along with Najee's parents
and his granddad.</i>

01:06:08.598 --> 01:06:10.932
<i>Well, Najee made it
to stage two last season,</i>

01:06:10.934 --> 01:06:13.068
<i>and he feels
even better this year.</i>

01:06:13.070 --> 01:06:15.437
<i>- Well, that's right, Matt,
and this is my pick to make it</i>

01:06:15.439 --> 01:06:16.671
<i>all the way to stage four.</i>

01:06:16.673 --> 01:06:18.073
<i>- And look at the big air</i>

01:06:18.075 --> 01:06:19.941
<i>he gets going on
to the Propeller Bar.</i>

01:06:19.943 --> 01:06:21.710
<i>He showed off
that explosiveness</i>

01:06:21.712 --> 01:06:23.678
<i>in our all-star
skills challenge,</i>

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:25.347
<i>going head to head
with Drew Drechsel.</i>

01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:27.782
- Get it, Naj! All you!
<i>- And there's Drew.</i>

01:06:27.784 --> 01:06:29.384
<i>We'll see him run in a moment,</i>

01:06:29.386 --> 01:06:31.720
<i>but right now Najee
facing the Double Dipper.</i>

01:06:31.722 --> 01:06:34.622
<i>- We talked a lot about
Najee's gymnastics background.</i>

01:06:34.624 --> 01:06:36.691
<i>He's used to working
on the high bar,</i>

01:06:36.693 --> 01:06:38.660
<i>and we've seen
how high he can fly.</i>

01:06:38.662 --> 01:06:40.061
<i>He's gonna get this.</i>

01:06:40.063 --> 01:06:43.231
<i>- Got it. Oh, my!
- Did you see that?</i>

01:06:43.233 --> 01:06:46.167
<i>He went right into
a front handspring.</i>

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:49.270
- That was awesome.
<i>- Well, it impressed Drechsel.</i>

01:06:49.272 --> 01:06:53.641
<i>Now staring down the Jumping
Spider.</i>

01:06:53.643 --> 01:06:55.276
<i>He's locked in.</i>

01:06:55.278 --> 01:06:57.979
<i>- He's been training six days
a week to get ready,</i>

01:06:57.981 --> 01:07:00.415
<i>and he just looks a lot more
confident than last year.</i>

01:07:00.417 --> 01:07:04.386
<i>- Such power here,
setting up for Parkour Run.</i>

01:07:04.388 --> 01:07:06.121
- Light on your feet, Naj!

01:07:06.123 --> 01:07:09.691
<i>- He's got over 1:30 left,
plenty of time here,</i>

01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:13.928
<i>just needs to avoid a mistake.</i>

01:07:13.930 --> 01:07:16.765
<i>- Goes for the rope.</i>

01:07:16.767 --> 01:07:20.535
<i>- Uh-oh.
- Oh, boy, that's not good.</i>

01:07:20.537 --> 01:07:22.103
<i>- A little misstep here.</i>

01:07:22.105 --> 01:07:23.905
<i>- Come on, now.
- Good recovery.</i>

01:07:23.907 --> 01:07:25.440
<i>Plenty of time
for the Phoenix.</i>

01:07:25.442 --> 01:07:26.908
<i>That's the good thing about</i>

01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:29.110
<i>flying through this course
the way he has.</i>

01:07:29.112 --> 01:07:31.746
- Beat that wall.

01:07:31.748 --> 01:07:32.981
<i>- Come on, get up there,
big, big up.</i>

01:07:32.983 --> 01:07:34.749
<i>- He gets it.
- Nice.</i>

01:07:34.751 --> 01:07:37.519
<i>- No one gets their arms up
above the wall like he does,</i>

01:07:37.521 --> 01:07:39.721
<i>and now just
two obstacles to go.</i>

01:07:39.723 --> 01:07:43.158
<i>Up next, the balance obstacle,
the Domino Pipes.</i>

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:44.659
- Come on.
- All right, Naj.

01:07:44.661 --> 01:07:46.428
- Home stretch, let's do this.

01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:48.063
<i>- Watch that foot placement.</i>

01:07:48.065 --> 01:07:49.831
<i>- Watch him dance.
- Dance, domino, yeah.</i>

01:07:49.833 --> 01:07:53.568
<i>- Perfect, and right into it,
and the gymnast should be</i>

01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:56.004
<i>right at home here
on the Flying Squirrel.</i>

01:07:59.342 --> 01:08:01.076
<i>- Nice transfer.</i>

01:08:01.078 --> 01:08:05.280
<i>- Najee Richardson, how far
can he go this year?</i>

01:08:05.282 --> 01:08:08.817
<i>Showing why he's called
the Phoenix, this guy can fly.</i>

01:08:08.819 --> 01:08:12.654
<i>- Look at that,
almost to the top!</i>

01:08:12.656 --> 01:08:14.789
<i>And all that extra training
is paying off.</i>

01:08:14.791 --> 01:08:17.658
<i>- And Najee Richardson's
going back to stage two</i>

01:08:17.661 --> 01:08:21.029
<i>for the second year in a row.</i>

01:08:21.031 --> 01:08:24.064
<i>Add his name to that growing
list of finishers.</i>

01:08:24.067 --> 01:08:25.800
- Yeah!

01:08:25.801 --> 01:08:28.970
<i>- Najee Richardson
destroys stage one.</i>

01:08:28.971 --> 01:08:31.973
- Whoo!
<i>- This guy is smooth.</i>

01:08:31.975 --> 01:08:34.274
<i>Watch this move again
on the Double Dipper.</i>

01:08:34.277 --> 01:08:37.312
<i>Slides down and goes right
into a front handspring,</i>

01:08:37.314 --> 01:08:40.314
<i>and as always, he skies high
on the Warped Wall,</i>

01:08:40.317 --> 01:08:43.184
<i>and then almost flew
to the top of the cargo net,</i>

01:08:43.185 --> 01:08:45.520
<i>and Najee's moving on.</i>

01:08:45.522 --> 01:08:47.388
- He's standing by
with Kristine.

01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:49.323
- Najee, you were
so awesome tonight

01:08:49.326 --> 01:08:51.292
that you actually added
another element

01:08:51.294 --> 01:08:54.095
to one of the obstacles,
a front handspring.

01:08:54.096 --> 01:08:56.464
Did that just happen
by accident or it was planned?

01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:57.966
- It's pretty natural.
- I'm a gymnast,

01:08:57.968 --> 01:09:00.435
so whenever I have too
much momentum going forward,

01:09:00.437 --> 01:09:01.970
<i>a flip seems to be
the best way.</i>

01:09:01.971 --> 01:09:03.171
<i>- It's just natural,
flip around.</i>

01:09:03.173 --> 01:09:04.706
<i>- Oh, yeah, absolutely.</i>

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:07.341
- Congratulations, Najee.
- Thank you so much. Thank you.

01:09:07.344 --> 01:09:10.178
- Matt and Akbar, back to you.

01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:14.314
<i>- Coming up...
- she's only 5 feet tall.</i>

01:09:14.317 --> 01:09:16.084
<i>Wow!</i>

01:09:16.086 --> 01:09:19.587
<i>But she's had a huge impact
on a generation of ninjas.</i>

01:09:19.589 --> 01:09:21.055
<i>- I can look back and know</i>

01:09:21.057 --> 01:09:23.758
that I made a difference
in this sport.

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:26.627
<i>- Kacy Catanzaro takes
the course for what may be</i>

01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:28.162
<i>her final run</i>

01:09:28.165 --> 01:09:30.832
<i>when "American Ninja
Warrior" returns.</i>

01:09:34.569 --> 01:09:37.839
<i>- Welcome back to "American
Ninja Warrior" in Las Vegas.</i>

01:09:37.841 --> 01:09:39.407
<i>- Get it! Get it!</i>

01:09:39.408 --> 01:09:43.144
<i>- Whoo!
- Oh, no! What?</i>

01:09:43.145 --> 01:09:46.548
<i>- These national finals have
already produced heartbreak...</i>

01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:48.316
<i>- I thought she was
home free.</i>

01:09:48.318 --> 01:09:50.652
<i>- And heroes.</i>

01:09:50.654 --> 01:09:54.389
<i>The second woman ever to hit
the buzzer on stage one!</i>

01:09:54.391 --> 01:09:58.893
<i>And next week we take on
the rest of the mountain.</i>

01:09:58.895 --> 01:10:02.931
<i>It starts with
a high-flying stage two.</i>

01:10:02.933 --> 01:10:04.732
<i>Whoever gets past that test</i>

01:10:04.734 --> 01:10:08.002
<i>takes on the even more
grueling stage three,</i>

01:10:08.004 --> 01:10:10.238
<i>and if anyone survives,</i>

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:14.809
<i>they'll climb stage four
for a million dollars.</i>

01:10:14.811 --> 01:10:18.379
<i>It all goes down next week
on the season finale</i>

01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:21.249
<i>of "American Ninja Warrior."</i>

01:10:21.251 --> 01:10:22.784
- Whoo!

01:10:24.654 --> 01:10:26.955
<i>- So we may break
our all-time record</i>

01:10:26.957 --> 01:10:28.923
<i>for finishers on stage one.</i>

01:10:28.925 --> 01:10:30.525
<i>Our next athlete
will try to be</i>

01:10:30.527 --> 01:10:32.193
<i>the 38th to hit the buzzer,</i>

01:10:32.195 --> 01:10:34.562
<i>and he's someone
we expect to do it.</i>

01:10:34.564 --> 01:10:36.331
<i>This is Daniel Gil.</i>

01:10:36.333 --> 01:10:39.133
<i>The Houston worship leader
went further than everyone</i>

01:10:39.135 --> 01:10:40.668
<i>but Drew Drechsel last season.</i>

01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:44.839
<i>He's a favorite to go far
again here in Vegas.</i>

01:10:44.841 --> 01:10:47.875
<i>As always, his wife, Abby,
is on the sidelines.</i>

01:10:47.877 --> 01:10:49.744
- Whoo! Come on!

01:10:49.746 --> 01:10:51.746
<i>- Along with Daniel's mom and
other members of his family.</i>

01:10:54.351 --> 01:10:56.184
<i>Daniel Gil, the only finisher</i>

01:10:56.186 --> 01:10:58.753
<i>out of the San Antonio
city finals,</i>

01:10:58.755 --> 01:11:00.788
<i>a brutal course.</i>

01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:02.357
<i>- And he was the fastest
in San Antonio,</i>

01:11:02.359 --> 01:11:05.827
<i>and he wants to be
the fastest on stage one.</i>

01:11:05.829 --> 01:11:07.562
- Whoo!

01:11:07.564 --> 01:11:10.865
<i>- Lance Pekus still has
the top time set last week.</i>

01:11:10.867 --> 01:11:12.433
<i>That's what Gil
is gunning for,</i>

01:11:12.435 --> 01:11:14.602
<i>but first needs to get past
this Double Dipper.</i>

01:11:14.604 --> 01:11:17.839
<i>- Look at that hair again,
flying all over the place.</i>

01:11:17.841 --> 01:11:20.408
<i>- And right through.</i>

01:11:20.410 --> 01:11:22.143
<i>Only about 30 seconds gone,</i>

01:11:22.145 --> 01:11:24.979
<i>and he's ready
for the Jumping Spider.</i>

01:11:24.981 --> 01:11:26.547
<i>No problem for Gil.</i>

01:11:26.549 --> 01:11:30.885
<i>Look at that flexibility,
5'9", 155.</i>

01:11:30.887 --> 01:11:33.855
<i>- Wow, good job.
- Well, here's Lance Pekus,</i>

01:11:33.857 --> 01:11:35.523
<i>and his time is in jeopardy.</i>

01:11:35.525 --> 01:11:37.492
<i>Gil is the fastest
to this point.</i>

01:11:37.494 --> 01:11:39.127
<i>- Look, Daniel Gil's a dancer,</i>

01:11:39.129 --> 01:11:41.763
<i>so he should have the footwork
for Parkour Run.</i>

01:11:41.765 --> 01:11:43.364
<i>- Bounding through it.</i>

01:11:43.366 --> 01:11:46.901
<i>- This has just been
an Olympic sprint so far.</i>

01:11:46.903 --> 01:11:49.203
<i>- Ooh! Good recovery there.</i>

01:11:49.205 --> 01:11:52.740
<i>A minor slip-up,
but now the Warped Wall.</i>

01:11:52.742 --> 01:11:55.610
<i>- And this is where the legs
start to get a little tired.</i>

01:11:55.612 --> 01:11:57.111
<i>- But no problem for Gil.</i>

01:11:57.113 --> 01:11:58.946
Daniel! Daniel!

01:11:58.948 --> 01:12:00.815
<i>- Michelle Warnky
and this crowd</i>

01:12:00.817 --> 01:12:02.984
<i>just starting up
the Daniel chant.</i>

01:12:02.986 --> 01:12:05.820
<i>He's still just ahead
of Pekus's time.</i>

01:12:05.822 --> 01:12:08.523
<i>- All right, just don't mess
up on these Domino Pipes.</i>

01:12:11.127 --> 01:12:12.560
<i>- And he's through,</i>

01:12:12.562 --> 01:12:14.796
<i>going right
into the Flying Squirrel.</i>

01:12:14.798 --> 01:12:17.932
<i>- Whoo, and he's gonna be
close to beat Pekus's time.</i>

01:12:17.934 --> 01:12:19.867
<i>It's gonna go
down to the wire.</i>

01:12:19.869 --> 01:12:22.270
<i>- Well, he's already hit
two buzzers this year.</i>

01:12:22.272 --> 01:12:24.405
<i>Trying to hit four more
here in Vegas</i>

01:12:24.407 --> 01:12:26.307
<i>and win that million dollars.</i>

01:12:26.309 --> 01:12:29.410
<i>- And he needs a big swing
here up onto the cargo net.</i>

01:12:29.412 --> 01:12:31.412
<i>- Look at that swing,</i>

01:12:31.414 --> 01:12:33.581
<i>lands him high up
on the cargo net.</i>

01:12:33.583 --> 01:12:35.249
<i>That's gonna save him time.</i>

01:12:35.251 --> 01:12:37.719
<i>- Still got to hurry though.
- This is gonna be close.</i>

01:12:37.721 --> 01:12:41.789
<i>- And he's done it!</i>

01:12:41.791 --> 01:12:45.159
<i>Daniel Gil puts up
the fastest time so far,</i>

01:12:45.161 --> 01:12:46.694
<i>and he's moving on to
stage two</i>

01:12:46.696 --> 01:12:49.330
<i>for the third year in a row.</i>

01:12:49.332 --> 01:12:51.666
- One stage down,
three more to go.

01:12:51.668 --> 01:12:54.102
<i>- Daniel Gill
had one minor hiccup</i>

01:12:54.104 --> 01:12:57.004
<i>on Parkour Run,
but it didn't slow him down.</i>

01:12:57.006 --> 01:13:00.108
<i>He flies high up on the
cargo net to save seconds</i>

01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:02.377
<i>and give him the fastest time,</i>

01:13:02.379 --> 01:13:06.247
<i>and he becomes our 38th
finisher on stage one,</i>

01:13:06.249 --> 01:13:09.083
<i>tying the old record.</i>

01:13:09.085 --> 01:13:12.186
<i>- But now the moment
has arrived,</i>

01:13:12.188 --> 01:13:14.422
<i>and this crowd knows it.</i>

01:13:14.424 --> 01:13:16.758
<i>You can hear the Kacy chants
because at the starting line</i>

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:22.029
<i>right now is Kacy Catanzaro,
and as we've been telling you,</i>

01:13:22.031 --> 01:13:24.332
<i>unless she hits the buzzer
and moves on,</i>

01:13:24.334 --> 01:13:27.468
<i>this will be her final run on
"American Ninja Warrior"</i>

01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:30.037
<i>to end an unbelievable career.</i>

01:13:30.039 --> 01:13:33.207
<i>No one has been a more
inspirational figure to women,</i>

01:13:33.209 --> 01:13:35.576
<i>men, and the entire

01:13:35.578 --> 01:13:37.412
<i>Mighty Kacy will be missed.</i>

<i>Go, Kacy, go!

<i>I have a new,

- All right, excellent.

01:13:52.028 --> 01:13:54.295
<i>- The WWE asked me to come

01:13:54.297 --> 01:13:57.432

of mine since I was young.

01:13:57.434 --> 01:13:59.567

<i>- Learning to be a wrestler</i>

01:13:59.569 --> 01:14:01.102

01:14:03.339 --> 01:14:05.039
<i>and of course being a ninja</i>

01:14:05.041 --> 01:14:07.141

<i>And that's gonna be
a tough time to beat,</i>

01:19:40.576 --> 01:19:42.343
<i>but if there's anyone
who can do it,</i>

01:19:42.345 --> 01:19:43.811
<i>even in this loaded field,</i>

01:19:43.813 --> 01:19:45.679
<i>it's got to be
our next athlete,</i>

01:19:45.681 --> 01:19:47.214
<i>Drew Drechsel.
Oh!</i>

01:19:47.216 --> 01:19:49.116
<i>The Connecticut gym owner
likes to go fast,</i>

01:19:49.118 --> 01:19:50.651
<i>and he likes to go far.</i>

01:19:50.653 --> 01:19:52.853
<i>He went farther
than anyone last year,</i>

01:19:52.855 --> 01:19:54.488
<i>but he's nervous for this run.</i>

01:19:54.490 --> 01:19:58.559
- I've beaten stage one
every year, and, knock on wood,

01:19:58.561 --> 01:20:00.828
I don't want this
to be the first year I go down,

01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:02.530
but it's definitely
something that every year

01:20:02.532 --> 01:20:04.865
I get nervous about because
there's new obstacles.

01:20:04.867 --> 01:20:06.367
It's exciting. It's big.

01:20:06.369 --> 01:20:09.637
It's the first course
of the national finals,

01:20:09.639 --> 01:20:11.172
and there's a lot of pressure.

01:20:11.174 --> 01:20:12.740
<i>- There's Drew's girlfriend,
April,</i>

01:20:12.742 --> 01:20:14.875
<i>along with his good friend,
Jessie Graff,</i>

01:20:14.877 --> 01:20:17.378
<i>and basically all the other
ninjas will be watching</i>

01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:19.013
<i>along with a big group
of his students</i>

01:20:19.015 --> 01:20:21.382
<i>that came from Connecticut
to watch him tonight.</i>

01:20:23.553 --> 01:20:25.352
<i>And there's the time
to beat by Salinas.</i>

01:20:25.354 --> 01:20:28.055
<i>Drechsel will have to be
flying to top that.</i>

01:20:28.057 --> 01:20:30.224
<i>- Well, don't put it
past Drew Drechsel.</i>

01:20:30.226 --> 01:20:31.859
<i>- Already on the Propeller Bar</i>

01:20:31.861 --> 01:20:35.729
<i>but a little tangled up
with the rope.</i>

01:20:35.731 --> 01:20:37.665
<i>Little mistakes like that
could cost him,</i>

01:20:37.667 --> 01:20:41.001
<i>- but now he's through.
- He was the fastest finisher</i>

01:20:41.003 --> 01:20:43.070
<i>in Daytona qualifying and city
finals.</i>

01:20:43.072 --> 01:20:45.873
<i>He's only got one speed.</i>

01:20:45.875 --> 01:20:48.843
<i>- And just glides right
through the Double Dipper,</i>

01:20:48.845 --> 01:20:51.045
<i>and right into
the Jumping Spider,</i>

01:20:51.047 --> 01:20:53.047
<i>and he's clearly going
for the fastest time, Akbar.</i>

01:20:53.049 --> 01:20:54.715
<i>- Yeah, he is. Yeah, he is.
- Oh, my.</i>

01:20:54.717 --> 01:20:56.684
<i>- Yeah, he's seconds ahead</i>

01:20:56.686 --> 01:20:58.752
<i>of where Salinas
was at this point.</i>

01:20:58.754 --> 01:21:00.221
<i>This is gonna be close.</i>

01:21:00.223 --> 01:21:01.956
<i>- Drechsel always
great footwork,</i>

01:21:01.958 --> 01:21:04.725
<i>so we don't expect
problems on Parkour Run,</i>

01:21:04.727 --> 01:21:06.227
<i>but what's this?</i>

01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:08.529
<i>Just skipping the rope
and hopping to the end!</i>

01:21:08.531 --> 01:21:10.865
<i>- Wow, what? Well,
that'll shave off some time.</i>

01:21:10.867 --> 01:21:12.366
<i>- He's not afraid
to take chances</i>

01:21:12.368 --> 01:21:15.135
<i>and now heading right up
the Warped Wall.</i>

01:21:15.137 --> 01:21:17.671
<i>Well, he is flexing
his muscles here,</i>

01:21:17.673 --> 01:21:22.343
<i>reminding everyone why he is
known as the Real-Life Ninja.</i>

01:21:22.345 --> 01:21:24.778
<i>- We've seen 99 others
run this course</i>

01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:26.213
<i>over the past two weeks,</i>

01:21:26.215 --> 01:21:28.115
<i>and Drechsel still makes
it entertaining.</i>

01:21:28.117 --> 01:21:29.683
<i>Ooh, ooh, wow!</i>

01:21:29.685 --> 01:21:32.820
<i>- Smooth, and right onto
the Flying Squirrel.</i>

01:21:32.822 --> 01:21:36.023
<i>Has about 30 seconds
if he wants the top time.</i>

01:21:36.025 --> 01:21:38.459
<i>- Whoo!
- He's got his tongue out.</i>

01:21:38.461 --> 01:21:39.960
<i>Oh!</i>

01:21:39.962 --> 01:21:41.662
<i>- Makes it to the last set
of handles.</i>

01:21:41.664 --> 01:21:43.964
<i>I don't think
he's taken a breath yet.</i>

01:21:43.966 --> 01:21:46.267
<i>Just needs
a couple more swings.</i>

01:21:46.269 --> 01:21:49.403
<i>- He swings so high.
- Get it, get it.</i>

01:21:49.405 --> 01:21:51.038
<i>- And he's got it!
- Nice!</i>

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:53.974
<i>- Drew Drechsel making
a statement with this run.</i>

01:21:53.976 --> 01:21:56.010
<i>- Uh-huh, uh-huh,
another finisher.</i>

01:21:56.012 --> 01:22:00.481
<i>- And Drew Drechsel,
the fastest time of the night,</i>

01:22:00.483 --> 01:22:04.752
<i>the Real-Life Ninja showing
everyone this is his season.</i>

01:22:06.923 --> 01:22:09.490
<i>Well, we are witnessing
something special.</i>

01:22:09.492 --> 01:22:11.859
<i>The greatness is all around.</i>

01:22:11.861 --> 01:22:14.561
- Whoo!
<i>- Drew Drechsel</i>

01:22:14.563 --> 01:22:16.230
<i>conquering stage one</i>

01:22:16.232 --> 01:22:17.798
<i>with the fastest time
of the night.</i>

01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:19.466
<i>- You know how it goes down.</i>

01:22:19.468 --> 01:22:21.635
<i>This is gonna be POM Wonderful</i>

01:22:21.637 --> 01:22:23.203
<i>Crazy Healthy
Run of the Night.</i>

01:22:23.205 --> 01:22:25.005
<i>Watch this move.</i>

01:22:25.007 --> 01:22:28.642
<i>He ignores the rope on Parkour
Run and just hops to the end,</i>

01:22:28.644 --> 01:22:32.613
<i>and the last runner on stage
one is the fastest runner.</i>

01:22:32.615 --> 01:22:36.116
<i>Drew Drechsel leads the pack
into next week's stage two.</i>

01:22:36.118 --> 01:22:38.786
<i>- And he's standing by
with Kristine.</i>

01:22:38.788 --> 01:22:41.655
- Drew, amazing job again,

01:22:41.657 --> 01:22:43.357
and you had the fastest time
of the night

01:22:43.359 --> 01:22:46.327
by five whole seconds.

01:22:46.329 --> 01:22:48.395
Was that your goal?

01:22:48.397 --> 01:22:50.497
- Well, I kind of had to finish
up before my song ended,

01:22:50.499 --> 01:22:52.733
so I had to make sure
that I pushed a little bit.

01:22:52.735 --> 01:22:55.302
<i>As I was hitting the buzzer,
my song was closing out.</i>

01:22:55.304 --> 01:22:57.037
- Look at this crowd
behind you.

01:22:57.039 --> 01:22:59.673
This is your...

01:22:59.675 --> 01:23:02.042
is this your biggest
cheering section ever?

01:23:02.044 --> 01:23:03.610
- It may be.
- I know last year was big.

01:23:03.612 --> 01:23:05.512
This may be even bigger.

01:23:05.514 --> 01:23:07.481
- Yeah!
- You're gonna need it.

01:23:07.483 --> 01:23:10.417
I hope that we have a lot more
stages ahead of you, Drew.

01:23:10.419 --> 01:23:11.919
- Me too, me too.
- This is just the beginning.

01:23:11.921 --> 01:23:15.356
- This is just the beginning.
- Guys, back to you.

01:23:15.358 --> 01:23:16.790
<i>- So in the end we had
a record</i>

01:23:16.792 --> 01:23:20.094
<i>41 finishers between
night one and night two,</i>

01:23:20.096 --> 01:23:22.196
<i>and Drew Drechsel
is the fastest of them</i>

01:23:22.198 --> 01:23:24.865
<i>all in this
star-studded field.</i>

01:23:24.867 --> 01:23:26.433
<i>Among the others moving
on to stage two</i>

01:23:26.435 --> 01:23:28.869
<i>are the Weatherman,
Joe Moravsky.</i>

01:23:28.871 --> 01:23:32.172
<i>At 42, the Tennessee
trader Travis Rosen</i>

01:23:32.174 --> 01:23:35.209
<i>will be the oldest
to take on stage two.</i>

01:23:35.211 --> 01:23:38.112
<i>The Phoenix, Najee Richardson,
had a fast time</i>

01:23:38.114 --> 01:23:42.349
<i>but still ended up in the 16th
spot in this talented field.</i>

01:23:42.351 --> 01:23:44.118
<i>The Godfather, David Campbell,</i>

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:48.522
<i>will be going back to stage
two after a five-year absence.</i>

01:23:48.524 --> 01:23:50.758
<i>Super fan Tyler Gillett,
at 21,</i>

01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:53.694
<i>will be the youngest
competitor moving on.</i>

01:23:53.696 --> 01:23:56.296
<i>Last year's rookie
sensation Josh Levin</i>

01:23:56.298 --> 01:23:59.833
<i>is going to stage two
for the second year in a row,</i>

01:23:59.835 --> 01:24:01.468
<i>and there's Allyssa Beird,</i>

01:24:01.470 --> 01:24:04.805
<i>just the second woman
ever to beat stage one.</i>

01:24:04.807 --> 01:24:07.441
<i>Rounding out the group of
finishers is the Eskimo Ninja,</i>

01:24:07.443 --> 01:24:09.777
<i>Nick Hanson,
so we'll have more ninjas</i>

01:24:09.779 --> 01:24:12.946
<i>than ever attacking
stage two next week.</i>

01:24:12.948 --> 01:24:15.182
For Akbar Gbajabiamila
and Kristine Leahy,

01:24:15.184 --> 01:24:16.450
I'm Matt Iseman.

01:24:16.452 --> 01:24:18.919
We'll see you next time
for the season finale

01:24:18.921 --> 01:24:20.888
of "American Ninja Warrior."
