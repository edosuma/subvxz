00:02.080 --> 00:03.664
Previously on Gilmore Girls:

00:03.747 --> 00:05.873
- You're an amazing woman.
- Thanks for noticing.

00:05.916 --> 00:07.709
What exactly is going on
between you two?

00:07.792 --> 00:10.710
- We're friends, that's it.
- You're idiots, the both of you.

00:10.753 --> 00:13.338
I have to get to the bus stop.
Dean's meeting me there.

00:13.422 --> 00:15.340
I'm trying to talk to you.

00:15.423 --> 00:18.341
You sneaking around
buying somebody else's strawberries?

00:18.426 --> 00:20.052
I needed the strawberries.

00:20.094 --> 00:21.386
I get jealous sometimes.

00:21.470 --> 00:24.055
I mean, you seem to have
this really great life going...

00:24.138 --> 00:26.765
and I don't really fit in there.

00:26.849 --> 00:28.225
Lane, I'm so sorry.

00:28.267 --> 00:29.893
I've been the worst friend lately.

00:29.976 --> 00:32.394
- A zucchini tush?
- Just a temporary name.

00:32.436 --> 00:35.272
You want me to serve
a genetically engineered vegetable...

00:35.356 --> 00:36.523
named after a butt?

00:36.648 --> 00:39.692
So once you're settled with Dean,
could you ask him about Todd?

00:39.776 --> 00:40.818
Absolutely.

00:40.902 --> 00:42.861
When did you become
the relationship expert?

00:42.945 --> 00:45.863
You haven't been in a relationship
in years.

00:45.947 --> 00:46.906
Wow.

00:46.990 --> 00:48.491
I'm not gonna charge you for these.

00:48.574 --> 00:51.784
I would rather starve myself
than know that my food was paid for...

00:51.868 --> 00:54.161
by the lowered expectations
of the American public.

00:54.245 --> 00:55.621
- Jackson?
- What?

00:55.705 --> 00:58.999
Would you like to go
to dinner sometime with me?

00:59.458 --> 01:00.500
Okay.

01:05.671 --> 01:06.713
Mom!

01:08.000 --> 01:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:08.142 --> 03:10.352
Wow. You went new CD crazy.

03:10.435 --> 03:12.478
They just had an amazing selection today.

03:12.520 --> 03:16.606
The Best of Blondie, Kraftwerk,
Young Marble Giants...

03:17.190 --> 03:18.607
Yoko Ono. Really?

03:18.692 --> 03:21.527
A misunderstood artist.
The Beatles would've broken up anyway.

03:21.611 --> 03:22.987
Have you shared your theory?

03:23.028 --> 03:26.489
I know it, so do Yoko and Sean.
Julian's in denial, but what can you do?

03:26.531 --> 03:29.533
I must listen
to anyone named Claudine Longet.

03:32.869 --> 03:34.870
- Rory.
- Yes, Lane?

03:34.913 --> 03:36.956
I have a favor to ask you.

03:37.248 --> 03:39.249
- You know Dean?
- My boyfriend?

03:39.333 --> 03:40.667
- Yes, I do.
- Okay.

03:40.751 --> 03:43.002
Remember I was telling you
about his friend, Todd?

03:43.044 --> 03:44.044
Yes.

03:44.128 --> 03:45.545
- Have you met him?
- No.

03:45.629 --> 03:47.255
- He's cool.
- Good.

03:47.339 --> 03:49.132
- Really cool.
- Good again.

03:49.215 --> 03:51.341
- Really, really cool.
- Good still holds.

03:51.384 --> 03:53.510
So cool that it brings me
to the next question.

03:53.552 --> 03:55.928
- I'm studying in there.
- I know.

03:56.012 --> 03:59.389
I have, like, 6,000 pages
of case studies to memorize...

03:59.473 --> 04:03.309
and a big test on the Wal-Mart
phenomenon coming up on Friday.

04:03.393 --> 04:08.271
Because I have a life and a job to
concentrate on besides business school...

04:08.355 --> 04:10.022
I'm behind and I'll probably fail.

04:10.107 --> 04:14.068
Then that 18-year-old annoying gnat
who sits behind me will get another 'A'...

04:14.110 --> 04:17.487
and make that 'I'm smart, you're dumb'
face to me for the whole week...

04:17.571 --> 04:20.531
and I'll be very upset and will possibly cry.

04:20.615 --> 04:22.491
- The music's too loud.
- Yes.

04:22.575 --> 04:24.326
- Got it.
- Thank you.

04:25.869 --> 04:30.038
I was wondering if you could talk
to Dean about talking to Todd about me.

04:30.081 --> 04:31.123
I guess.

04:31.207 --> 04:34.000
And then maybe you could ask Dean
to ask him out.

04:34.084 --> 04:35.251
For me.

04:35.335 --> 04:38.212
Good, 'cause I don't think Dean
would wanna go out with Todd.

04:38.254 --> 04:39.588
It'd screw up their friendship.

04:39.672 --> 04:42.674
I was thinking this date
could maybe happen this weekend.

04:42.757 --> 04:44.675
Sunday, preferably. After church.

04:44.759 --> 04:46.677
- But don't mention church.
- Hold on a second.

04:46.760 --> 04:47.885
Unless he's into church.

04:47.970 --> 04:49.804
Now it's too quiet.

04:50.263 --> 04:52.389
- I'll turn it up.
- Thank you.

04:53.391 --> 04:54.558
So, what do you think?

04:54.600 --> 04:57.727
- Who the hell is that anyway?
- Claudine Longet.

04:58.061 --> 05:01.355
- The chick who shot the skier?
- Sure, why not?

05:02.439 --> 05:04.148
Renaissance woman.

05:05.108 --> 05:07.568
- You want me to set you up with Todd?
- Yes.

05:07.610 --> 05:12.155
I was thinking that you and Dean could
come with us so it isn't that big of a deal.

05:12.239 --> 05:13.239
You don't wanna do it.

05:13.323 --> 05:15.783
- No. L...
- That's okay, I understand. No big deal.

05:15.867 --> 05:18.827
Grandaddy, new album, used.
I love a bargain.

05:18.911 --> 05:21.454
- I really don't know this Todd guy.
- I do.

05:21.538 --> 05:23.956
- You've met him twice.
- But the third time's a charm.

05:23.998 --> 05:25.999
- How do you know he's right for you?
- I know.

05:26.083 --> 05:28.084
I'm telling you,
we're talking soul mate here.

05:28.168 --> 05:29.919
The last time you met your soul mate...

05:29.961 --> 05:33.255
you ran your fingers through his hair
and ended up hiding at my house.

05:33.297 --> 05:37.008
I still have my key.
I made a mistake with Rich Bloomenfeld.

05:37.091 --> 05:38.842
Everyone's allowed one mistake.

05:38.926 --> 05:41.261
- But Todd is different.
- He is?

05:41.303 --> 05:43.846
First, his name is Todd.
Different name, different guy.

05:43.930 --> 05:45.264
Okay, so...

05:46.265 --> 05:49.100
how important is this whole
business school thing anyway?

05:49.184 --> 05:53.770
So what if I never run my own inn?
I like my job, my house, and my life.

05:53.896 --> 05:55.814
I don't wanna be one of those people...

05:55.898 --> 05:59.233
who's never satisfied with what they have,
you know.

05:59.317 --> 06:03.153
I mean, some people don't have legs
or arms.

06:03.571 --> 06:05.489
I have legs and arms.

06:06.031 --> 06:09.033
What more could I possibly want
than legs and arms?

06:09.117 --> 06:12.953
I could take all the classes in the world,
that's not gonna give me what I have.

06:13.036 --> 06:14.829
- Legs and arms?
- Yes.

06:15.788 --> 06:18.790
- Am I sounding completely crazy?
- Yes, you are.

06:18.874 --> 06:20.958
- Wal-Mart is boring.
- Study.

06:24.420 --> 06:26.087
- So?
- So?

06:26.463 --> 06:27.922
- Rory.
- Okay.

06:28.090 --> 06:30.466
- Really?
- Yes, Yoko.

06:37.597 --> 06:39.306
So, what you doing?

06:52.317 --> 06:53.359
Yes, Michel?

06:53.443 --> 06:55.361
I apologize for any inconvenience...

06:55.403 --> 06:57.237
I might be causing
your future employment.

06:57.321 --> 06:59.739
But your current one
is experiencing a problem.

06:59.823 --> 07:01.240
Once again I say, 'Yes, Michel?'

07:01.324 --> 07:03.700
Are you sure you wouldn't like me to wait?

07:03.784 --> 07:04.784
No, Michel.

07:04.868 --> 07:08.287
Because learning the eating patterns
of the average Taco Bell consumer...

07:08.371 --> 07:11.164
- is a vital lesson that...
- What do you want?

07:11.207 --> 07:13.875
- We're overbooked.
- How are we overbooked?

07:13.959 --> 07:17.837
There are more people here
than there are rooms to put them in.

07:18.212 --> 07:19.337
I don't understand this.

07:19.380 --> 07:22.007
I cannot describe it any simpler
than I already have.

07:22.049 --> 07:23.383
Where did the Ruckers come from?

07:23.466 --> 07:24.800
Judging from their clothing...

07:24.884 --> 07:27.427
a town where high rubber fishing boots
and spittoons...

07:27.511 --> 07:29.637
would be considered formalwear.

07:29.721 --> 07:31.764
Put them in the Jefferson Suite tonight.

07:31.848 --> 07:33.599
Move them
to their booked room tomorrow.

07:33.683 --> 07:35.809
Offer dinner on the house
for the inconvenience.

07:35.893 --> 07:37.185
Very well.

07:38.436 --> 07:40.479
I'm gonna get some more coffee
if you need me.

07:40.563 --> 07:45.108
I'll try and manage while you're gone.
Though, God knows, it won't be easy.

07:49.403 --> 07:50.487
- Coffee?
- Yes.

07:50.571 --> 07:51.655
Great.

07:53.573 --> 07:55.407
- Meringue.
- Yeah.

07:55.491 --> 07:58.284
I thought I'd do a variation
on a baked Alaska for dessert.

07:58.369 --> 08:00.829
- What kind of variation?
- I hadn't thought of that yet.

08:00.912 --> 08:03.664
- You could do them in the shape of Alaska.
- Interesting.

08:03.748 --> 08:05.999
Or you could do
little baked Alaskas and Hawaiis.

08:06.083 --> 08:08.459
- Because they joined the Union last.
- Exactly.

08:10.920 --> 08:13.130
- Jackson.
- Sookie, hello.

08:13.214 --> 08:14.339
- Hello.
- Hey.

08:14.756 --> 08:18.550
- I brought you...
- Great. Just put them down there.

08:18.968 --> 08:20.427
Right. Yes.

08:21.637 --> 08:22.887
- How's that?
- That's great.

08:22.930 --> 08:24.889
It's perfect. I really like them there.

08:24.931 --> 08:28.725
- They do look good there, don't they?
- Yes, they do.

08:31.269 --> 08:33.270
- Okay. I should...
- Squash.

08:33.354 --> 08:34.980
- What?
- I need some.

08:35.063 --> 08:36.606
- Squash?
- Pattypan.

08:36.690 --> 08:38.191
- Okay, tomorrow.
- Same time?

08:38.275 --> 08:40.359
- Lf that's good for you.
- It's perfect.

08:40.443 --> 08:44.571
Okay. Then I'll see you tomorrow
with the pattypan.

08:44.655 --> 08:45.780
Great.

08:48.158 --> 08:49.242
Yes.

08:53.328 --> 08:55.788
Okay, who walked in on who naked?

08:55.872 --> 08:59.624
Oh, God, this is horrible.
He comes in and...

08:59.708 --> 09:01.084
What's going on between you two?

09:01.126 --> 09:03.127
I asked if he'd like
to have dinner sometime.

09:03.169 --> 09:04.628
- I know, weeks ago.
- He said yes.

09:04.712 --> 09:05.712
Which is good.

09:05.796 --> 09:08.256
But since there was no definite plan
or date attached...

09:08.340 --> 09:11.425
now the invitation is just out there
floating in the universe.

09:11.509 --> 09:13.510
- Make a definite plan.
- I can't.

09:13.594 --> 09:15.845
- Why?
- What if he says no?

09:15.929 --> 09:16.888
He already said yes.

09:16.972 --> 09:19.765
Yes to the amorphous, theoretical...

09:19.807 --> 09:23.559
let's go out sometime and do something
not too specific proposition.

09:23.644 --> 09:27.563
But dinner and a movie, it's concrete,
it's real. He might say no.

09:27.647 --> 09:29.773
- I doubt he will.
- Why hasn't he asked me?

09:29.857 --> 09:32.317
Maybe he thinks you changed your mind
since you asked.

09:32.401 --> 09:35.486
- Why would he think that?
- Because you haven't mentioned it again.

09:35.570 --> 09:39.197
- But I mentioned once. It's his turn.
- All right. Let's say it is his turn.

09:39.281 --> 09:42.616
You can spend time sitting around,
waiting for him to realize that...

09:42.700 --> 09:45.452
or you can run with the wolves
and make it your turn again.

09:45.494 --> 09:49.330
- I don't want it to be my turn again.
- You just wanna let this opportunity pass?

09:49.414 --> 09:51.123
- I wanna be the girl.
- You are.

09:51.207 --> 09:53.542
That's why we're having
this confusing conversation.

09:53.625 --> 09:55.543
- You think I should ask him out?
- On Sunday.

09:55.627 --> 09:57.044
- Why Sunday?
- That's your day off.

09:57.128 --> 09:58.295
- Okay.
- Now.

09:58.379 --> 10:00.380
- What?
- Do it now before you lose your nerve.

10:00.464 --> 10:03.257
- He isn't back to his office yet.
- Does he have a cell phone?

10:03.341 --> 10:06.051
- Yes.
- People buy them for exactly this reason.

10:06.135 --> 10:08.261
So you can get a hold of them
any time you want.

10:08.345 --> 10:11.639
I thought they bought cell phones
if their cars broke down at night...

10:11.723 --> 10:14.808
and they had to call someone for help
and there's psycho killers...

10:14.892 --> 10:17.185
Call him, Sookie.

10:17.686 --> 10:18.936
Call him.

10:22.982 --> 10:25.650
- She knows his number by heart.
- He is my produce guy.

10:25.734 --> 10:27.151
Very convenient excuse.

10:27.193 --> 10:28.569
Jackson, it's Sookie.

10:28.653 --> 10:31.655
I was wondering if you could call me back
when you get a chance.

10:31.739 --> 10:32.823
Sooner rather than later.

10:32.906 --> 10:35.407
It's not an emergency,
so don't freak out or anything.

10:35.492 --> 10:38.661
The carrots still look good.
Seems like it's a shame to eat them...

10:38.744 --> 10:40.828
sort of like you should put them in a vase...

10:40.871 --> 10:43.372
- Hang up.
- Call me. Bye.

10:44.540 --> 10:45.832
I got his voice mail.

10:45.875 --> 10:48.335
Good. It gives you time to prepare
what you'll say...

10:48.377 --> 10:50.503
maybe have suggestions ready
of places to go.

10:50.545 --> 10:52.129
- Date prep time.
- Yes.

10:52.213 --> 10:55.257
Okay, good. I'm good at that.
I'm good at prep.

10:57.467 --> 10:59.677
- Spoon.
- Right.

11:18.942 --> 11:21.443
- Is there anything in there about me?
- I don't know.

11:21.528 --> 11:23.946
Your name wouldn't be lithium, would it?

11:24.029 --> 11:25.613
Aren't you supposed to be in school?

11:25.697 --> 11:27.823
We had a half day today.
Teacher conferences.

11:27.908 --> 11:30.701
So I thought I'd come by and surprise you.

11:31.577 --> 11:35.204
- You know how much I hate surprises.
- Yes, I'm very sorry.

11:38.166 --> 11:41.543
- That's for surprising me.
- I have learned my lesson.

11:46.630 --> 11:48.297
I have to talk to you about something.

11:48.382 --> 11:51.426
I have to talk to you about something, too.
Come here.

11:56.388 --> 11:58.222
- Okay, stop.
- Sorry.

11:58.932 --> 12:00.725
- No, stay.
- Why?

12:00.808 --> 12:03.268
Because I really need to talk to you
about something.

12:03.352 --> 12:04.561
All right.

12:04.645 --> 12:06.938
- It's about Todd.
- What about him?

12:07.021 --> 12:09.022
- What do you think of him?
- He's my friend.

12:09.106 --> 12:13.067
- I know.
- That would signify a positive impression.

12:13.110 --> 12:14.986
Right. Okay, good.

12:15.069 --> 12:17.987
- Yes. Can I kiss you now?
- I'm not done yet.

12:18.322 --> 12:20.907
- Fine, go ahead.
- You know Lane.

12:21.449 --> 12:24.076
- Yeah, I do.
- She likes Todd.

12:24.744 --> 12:25.869
Okay.

12:25.953 --> 12:28.997
And I think that they would really hit it off.

12:30.832 --> 12:33.250
- You don't even know Todd.
- No, but you do.

12:33.334 --> 12:35.293
- And you like him, you said so.
- I did.

12:35.377 --> 12:37.378
Okay, then. There you go.

12:38.421 --> 12:40.255
I would really like to kiss you now.

12:40.339 --> 12:42.215
- Yes, so would I.
- Good. We agree.

12:42.299 --> 12:43.966
I think we should set them up.

12:44.050 --> 12:45.843
- Todd and Lane?
- Yeah.

12:46.719 --> 12:50.388
We could all go out together,
to a movie or something.

12:50.806 --> 12:52.098
On Sunday.

12:53.266 --> 12:55.934
It would be really casual. No big deal.

12:56.894 --> 12:58.395
- I just...
- What?

12:58.478 --> 13:01.730
I'm just not sure that I see them together.

13:02.398 --> 13:04.858
- You don't think Todd would like Lane?
- I'm not sure.

13:04.942 --> 13:06.651
- Lane is great.
- I know.

13:06.735 --> 13:08.402
- She's my best friend.
- I know that.

13:08.486 --> 13:11.488
- Todd should be so lucky to get her.
- I didn't mean...

13:11.572 --> 13:14.449
I can't believe you don't think
she's good or pretty enough.

13:14.533 --> 13:17.118
I didn't say anything about
her not being pretty enough.

13:17.160 --> 13:20.912
I don't know if he'll like her 'cause
I don't know what kind of girl he likes.

13:20.996 --> 13:23.706
But if you wanna do this,
then I'll talk to him.

13:23.790 --> 13:25.374
- You will?
- Yeah.

13:25.666 --> 13:28.167
- And you'll mention Sunday?
- I'll mention Sunday.

13:28.252 --> 13:30.336
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

13:30.879 --> 13:33.339
So, was that it?

13:33.589 --> 13:36.132
- Yeah, that was it.
- Then can we...

13:36.633 --> 13:38.634
Kissing. Right, let's go.

13:49.810 --> 13:51.769
- I give up.
- That's the spirit.

13:51.853 --> 13:53.562
I can't remember any of this crap.

13:53.646 --> 13:55.772
Not everyone is cut out
to be their own boss.

13:55.857 --> 13:57.858
Maybe you are more of a worker bee.

13:57.942 --> 14:00.485
A follower, a ticket ripper...

14:00.569 --> 14:03.654
or the man at the concert
with the orange glow stick...

14:03.696 --> 14:05.530
directing you where to park.

14:05.614 --> 14:07.156
- You're baiting me, aren't you?
- No.

14:07.240 --> 14:10.033
I seriously have no faith in your aptitude.

14:10.118 --> 14:12.202
He called!

14:12.620 --> 14:14.454
- And?
- I did what you said.

14:14.538 --> 14:17.582
I had it worked out
and asked him if he'd like to go to dinner...

14:17.665 --> 14:19.958
- at Chez Fleur on Sunday.
- Very nice.

14:20.042 --> 14:22.794
- Thank you, and he said he'd love to.
- Great.

14:22.878 --> 14:25.296
He said he would love to,
but his cousin's in town...

14:25.380 --> 14:27.006
and is staying with him for the week.

14:27.048 --> 14:28.799
Then just make it next week.

14:28.882 --> 14:30.383
That would've been a good option...

14:30.467 --> 14:32.385
had I thought of it
when I was on the phone.

14:32.469 --> 14:35.804
- Instead I came up with another option.
- Which is?

14:36.096 --> 14:38.556
That we double-date
with his cousin Rune and you.

14:38.640 --> 14:39.640
What?

14:39.724 --> 14:42.309
Okay, not as good as your option, I agree...

14:42.393 --> 14:44.352
but it seemed pretty good at the time...

14:44.395 --> 14:47.856
though I wasn't standing here
watching you make that face.

14:47.897 --> 14:52.692
- No, I hate blind dates.
- I know, but this isn't a blind date.

14:52.734 --> 14:57.237
This is you keeping his cousin company
while I have a date with Jackson.

14:57.321 --> 14:58.655
Oh, God.

14:58.739 --> 15:01.491
- Please? I'll be your best friend.
- You are my best friend.

15:01.575 --> 15:03.659
- And you're mine.
- I know I am.

15:03.743 --> 15:05.911
So what are best friends for?

15:07.204 --> 15:08.788
- Okay.
- Yes?

15:08.955 --> 15:10.414
Yes, I'll go.

15:11.082 --> 15:14.084
Thank you. You will not regret this.

15:14.126 --> 15:16.711
- Pick another phrase.
- You will not have to pay.

15:16.795 --> 15:18.212
Much better.

15:21.966 --> 15:23.216
Shut up.

15:26.594 --> 15:27.928
- Rory.
- What?

15:28.012 --> 15:29.388
- Diva Glam.
- I've got it.

15:29.430 --> 15:31.139
Bring it up. Hold still.

15:31.223 --> 15:34.183
- Not too much.
- No, just enough to say, 'Hey, sailor. '

15:34.267 --> 15:36.602
My stomach doesn't feel great.
I think I've the flu.

15:36.685 --> 15:38.019
- I think you're nervous.
- Here.

15:38.103 --> 15:40.229
- Thank you.
- I need the sparkly hair clips.

15:40.272 --> 15:41.439
I'll find them in a minute.

15:41.523 --> 15:44.650
- You look pretty.
- I do? Thank you.

15:45.275 --> 15:47.276
- I should cancel.
- Let's do your lips first.

15:47.360 --> 15:49.278
What if I'm making an idiot out of myself?

15:49.362 --> 15:51.989
- By going out on a date?
- With my produce guy.

15:52.072 --> 15:53.156
You like him.

15:53.240 --> 15:56.575
But what if tonight is a disaster
and then he won't sell to me anymore?

15:56.659 --> 15:58.618
- Oh, my God, you're right.
- Yes, see?

15:58.703 --> 16:01.705
Since all the produce in the entire world
is in his possession...

16:01.788 --> 16:04.957
and all the produce grown in the future
will be in his possession...

16:05.041 --> 16:08.793
then we will never again get any produce,
and our vegetarian clients will die.

16:08.877 --> 16:10.419
- I'm scared.
- I know.

16:10.504 --> 16:12.255
- I like him.
- He likes you.

16:12.297 --> 16:14.131
How do you know he's not being polite?

16:14.715 --> 16:18.009
No, I mean it.
It's like I cornered him. He felt trapped.

16:18.093 --> 16:20.261
- He had to say yes.
- He did not have to say yes.

16:20.345 --> 16:22.763
Oh, my God! Technically, I'm his employer.

16:22.805 --> 16:25.265
I am. I buy his wares.
His livelihood depends on me.

16:25.765 --> 16:29.100
- I'm a sexual harasser.
- Then you need some false eyelashes.

16:29.185 --> 16:32.187
This isn't funny. I am now desperate,
lonely, and a criminal.

16:32.271 --> 16:33.271
Stop talking.

16:33.355 --> 16:34.605
- But...
- No.

16:34.647 --> 16:37.315
You have exhausted all your talking rights
by being crazy.

16:37.400 --> 16:39.109
Sit down, and listen.

16:41.194 --> 16:42.444
Tonight is a good thing.

16:42.487 --> 16:44.738
Whether you find out
that you're madly in love...

16:44.822 --> 16:47.574
or you're not meant for each other,
it's still a good thing.

16:47.658 --> 16:48.658
I'll be right there.

16:48.742 --> 16:52.036
And have I done a gorgeous job
on your face or what?

16:52.745 --> 16:54.454
I'll be right back.

16:59.375 --> 17:00.834
You're sure you don't mind?

17:00.918 --> 17:03.294
- What's mine is yours.
- I owe you forever.

17:03.378 --> 17:04.753
Good to know.

17:04.838 --> 17:06.839
Which one do you think
Todd would like better?

17:06.923 --> 17:09.299
- I don't know Todd.
- I think the rhinestones.

17:09.340 --> 17:11.008
Rhinestones it is.

17:12.676 --> 17:14.136
What did you tell your mom?

17:14.220 --> 17:16.555
I told her I'd spend the evening here
with you guys.

17:16.638 --> 17:17.638
What if she calls?

17:17.723 --> 17:20.474
I mentioned we might go rent some videos
or go out to eat...

17:20.558 --> 17:23.602
- which could explain any absence.
- Very thorough.

17:23.685 --> 17:25.436
With my mom,
you leave nothing to chance.

17:25.521 --> 17:27.814
Especially when
there is a non-Korean involved...

17:27.856 --> 17:31.066
who, as far as I know,
has no medical aspirations.

17:31.442 --> 17:33.026
- Sparkly clips.
- Thank you.

17:33.110 --> 17:34.986
I like the rhinestones.

17:35.695 --> 17:37.821
And for a touch of glamour.

17:38.989 --> 17:42.074
- What are you gonna tell Lorelai?
- I don't know.

17:43.201 --> 17:45.327
She wouldn't tell my mom, would she?

17:45.369 --> 17:48.287
I don't know if she'd feel good
about lying to another mother.

17:48.372 --> 17:50.165
It's like this weird code thing with her.

17:50.248 --> 17:53.959
- So we don't tell her?
- I'm not liking that option, either.

17:54.126 --> 17:57.295
No. We'll tell her
that we're meeting Dean for a movie...

17:57.379 --> 17:58.713
and then we go to the movie...

17:58.797 --> 18:01.257
and then somebody
who happens to be Dean's friend...

18:01.340 --> 18:04.008
just happens to be there
for the same movie.

18:04.051 --> 18:06.844
So we figure that
it would be completely rude for us...

18:06.886 --> 18:09.554
to not ask said person to come sit with us.

18:09.638 --> 18:12.390
I say to hell with governor.
You run directly for president.

18:12.474 --> 18:14.141
It's not that bad.

18:14.767 --> 18:17.185
Let's just not think about it, okay?

18:17.269 --> 18:19.687
- I really appreciate this.
- I know.

18:20.522 --> 18:21.981
How do I look?

18:22.273 --> 18:25.734
- You look too good for him.
- Just what I was going for.

18:28.236 --> 18:30.362
- We're going.
- Where?

18:30.405 --> 18:33.740
- We're going to a movie with Dean.
- Nothing dirty, violent, or French.

18:33.824 --> 18:34.991
Are you gonna be home late?

18:35.075 --> 18:38.786
There's a bit of doubt as to whether or not
we'll ever get out tonight.

18:38.870 --> 18:40.371
Sookie, please!

18:40.829 --> 18:43.080
Okay, I'm here.

18:43.373 --> 18:44.623
I'm down.

18:47.418 --> 18:49.294
- Where's your coat?
- It's upstairs.

18:49.378 --> 18:52.338
- Aren't you gonna need it?
- It got caught around the thing...

18:52.422 --> 18:56.216
and when I twisted around to get loose,
the choking started.

18:56.925 --> 18:58.301
I'm free now.

18:58.385 --> 19:00.845
- I'll get you something to wear.
- I'd appreciate that.

19:00.928 --> 19:02.971
- Bye.
- Bye, kittens.

19:08.643 --> 19:10.310
This is beautiful.

19:10.603 --> 19:12.604
It goes with the theme of the evening.

19:12.646 --> 19:16.065
- This is a nice thing you're doing for me.
- Any time.

19:16.107 --> 19:17.483
Last looks.

19:21.153 --> 19:22.570
I'll get it.

19:27.741 --> 19:30.159
- Hi.
- Hi, Lorelai. Sorry we're late.

19:30.577 --> 19:33.621
No problem.
Adds more primping time for the ladies.

19:33.704 --> 19:36.080
- Hi, Jackson.
- Sookie.

19:36.873 --> 19:38.207
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:41.877 --> 19:44.545
Do you guys wanna come in for a minute?

19:44.629 --> 19:45.754
Sure.

19:48.382 --> 19:51.884
Lorelai, this is my cousin, Rune.
Rune, this is Lorelai.

19:51.968 --> 19:54.261
Hi. It's very nice to meet you.

19:55.263 --> 19:58.348
- Can I talk to you a minute?
- What's the matter?

19:58.432 --> 20:00.683
I need a minute alone. Please?

20:01.267 --> 20:02.601
Excuse us.

20:04.979 --> 20:07.105
- What are you doing?
- That's Lorelai?

20:07.147 --> 20:08.231
Yes.

20:08.648 --> 20:11.525
- Did you see how tall she is?
- No, I haven't noticed actually.

20:11.609 --> 20:13.819
How could you not?
She's like a basketball player.

20:13.902 --> 20:16.112
Rune, she's a very nice lady.

20:16.237 --> 20:18.655
I cannot go out with anyone that tall.

20:18.739 --> 20:20.990
God, I can't believe
you set me up with that.

20:21.074 --> 20:23.200
Was the bearded lady
busy tonight or something?

20:23.285 --> 20:24.827
Just one night, a little dinner.

20:24.911 --> 20:26.954
When she came to the door,
I didn't realize...

20:27.037 --> 20:28.996
that that was who
I'd spend the evening with.

20:29.081 --> 20:31.374
I thought it was her East German maid
or something.

20:31.458 --> 20:34.335
- You're ridiculous. She's not that tall.
- She's tall enough.

20:34.418 --> 20:36.544
Would you keep it down?
She's gonna hear you.

20:36.628 --> 20:39.004
With those big ears, I bet she can.

20:39.089 --> 20:41.590
Rune, you come into town
completely unannounced.

20:41.674 --> 20:45.260
You eat all my food, crash on my couch,
and I don't say a thing.

20:45.343 --> 20:47.844
The least you could do
is go out for one night.

20:47.929 --> 20:50.180
Make some conversation. Be pleasant.

20:50.264 --> 20:52.474
Who knows? Maybe you'll even enjoy it.

20:52.516 --> 20:54.559
Why can't we go out, just the two of us?

20:54.642 --> 20:56.476
Rune, please.

20:58.562 --> 21:00.521
- Okay.
- Thank you.

21:04.108 --> 21:08.361
- I think we should be going.
- Yes, that sounds good.

21:37.843 --> 21:39.927
What size shoe do you wear?

21:40.887 --> 21:43.097
- Size nine.
- Nine? Wow!

21:44.765 --> 21:47.183
I wonder if the mussels are fresh.

21:48.268 --> 21:50.644
It does say 'fresh mussels' on the menu.

21:50.728 --> 21:53.480
A lot of times they say fresh
when they're frozen.

21:53.563 --> 21:56.690
They're called fresh because they
were fresh when they were frozen.

21:56.733 --> 21:59.026
Plus if they're not stored
with correct drainage...

21:59.109 --> 22:02.278
they sit in their own excretion,
which is like sitting in your own...

22:02.362 --> 22:04.530
I beg of you,
do not order the fresh mussels.

22:04.614 --> 22:07.658
- But if they're fresh...
- Even if they're fresh.

22:11.286 --> 22:13.579
I wonder where they get
their carrots from.

22:13.663 --> 22:16.748
The carrot crop this year
has been really mealy.

22:20.543 --> 22:22.586
- So, Rune.
- Yes?

22:23.378 --> 22:26.088
- What is that? Rune?
- What do you mean?

22:26.506 --> 22:28.924
I mean, where did Rune come from?

22:29.758 --> 22:32.385
I'm from out of town.
I thought Jackson told you.

22:32.469 --> 22:37.181
He did. I meant the name 'Rune. '
You don't meet a lot of Runes, right?

22:37.431 --> 22:40.099
- It's my dad's name.
- Where'd he get it?

22:40.183 --> 22:42.226
I don't know. From his parents, I guess.

22:42.310 --> 22:45.354
Okay, done with that topic.
The waiter, thank the Lord.

22:45.437 --> 22:46.813
What can I get you?

22:46.897 --> 22:49.857
- Are the mussels fresh?
- Yes, they are.

22:49.941 --> 22:52.442
Where exactly are your carrots from?

22:52.818 --> 22:55.278
Is there anything on this menu
that isn't French?

22:55.362 --> 22:58.072
I'll just have a martini,
and keep them coming.

22:59.740 --> 23:00.907
Thanks.

23:10.874 --> 23:13.084
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

23:13.334 --> 23:14.710
They're fine.

23:14.794 --> 23:18.588
I am not looking at them.
I'm looking at the world around me.

23:18.630 --> 23:20.047
The world is fine, too.

23:20.131 --> 23:22.341
- I wanna make sure they're having fun.
- They are.

23:22.425 --> 23:23.592
How do you know?

23:23.634 --> 23:26.761
They aren't in prison
or some sort of medieval torture chamber.

23:26.845 --> 23:28.512
When you measure it that way.

23:28.596 --> 23:31.139
The amazing thing is
all these girls are screaming...

23:31.223 --> 23:33.224
and none of them are getting the joke.

23:33.308 --> 23:36.935
He's playing the character of a rock star.
Beck is a genius...

23:36.978 --> 23:39.062
and these stupid girls
are screaming at him...

23:39.146 --> 23:41.522
just because they're buying into
the rock star image.

23:41.606 --> 23:43.941
I love Beck. I understand Beck.

23:47.319 --> 23:49.445
And the Foo Fighters. Gods.

23:49.571 --> 23:52.698
Have you heard
the acoustic version of Everlong?

23:53.240 --> 23:55.366
I can't even talk about it.

23:58.244 --> 24:02.247
You know who I've really gotten
into lately? The Velvet Underground.

24:02.331 --> 24:06.626
And Nico. She is amazing.
Depressing, German, scary chick.

24:06.668 --> 24:09.670
I have the CD
if you wanna borrow it sometime.

24:10.629 --> 24:12.964
What kind of music do you like?

24:14.340 --> 24:16.341
I don't know. Whatever.

24:17.426 --> 24:19.135
- Fugazi?
- What?

24:19.344 --> 24:20.970
The band on your shirt.

24:23.347 --> 24:24.806
Cool picture.

24:25.265 --> 24:28.767
- You don't know what's on your shirt?
- It's my sister's.

24:36.858 --> 24:39.359
What about books? Do you like books?

24:41.069 --> 24:42.403
Magazines?

24:43.863 --> 24:46.740
What about school?
What are you majoring in?

24:47.449 --> 24:49.450
I was thinking about gym.

24:51.578 --> 24:55.789
If I major in gym, I only have to take
four classes my senior year.

24:57.582 --> 24:58.666
Cool.

25:02.003 --> 25:03.045
Gym?

25:04.129 --> 25:06.797
We work on our bikes together.
He's got the good tools.

25:06.881 --> 25:08.882
Come on in. I have your tickets ready.

25:13.136 --> 25:17.347
- It was so funny. Oh, God! You remember?
- I remember.

25:17.390 --> 25:19.808
- What was Rory, eight?
- I believe she was.

25:19.891 --> 25:23.018
Oh, God, that mud pie fiasco
haunted me for a year.

25:23.061 --> 25:24.562
Hers looked just like mine.

25:24.645 --> 25:27.855
Of course, I used homemade
chocolate cookies, bittersweet ganache...

25:27.939 --> 25:31.566
and she used mud.
But they did look damn similar.

25:37.947 --> 25:41.032
So, Sookie has been experimenting...

25:41.116 --> 25:44.952
with different forms of baking
for as long as I've known her.

25:45.828 --> 25:48.121
- That's very interesting.
- Yeah.

25:48.247 --> 25:51.833
Remember when I decided to teach you
how to make strawberry tarts...

25:51.917 --> 25:54.043
and the entire kitchen was stained red...

25:54.085 --> 25:58.213
and I had to repaint that one wall red
to make it look normal? Wasn't it?

25:58.588 --> 26:02.132
It was. Let's go powder our noses.

26:02.383 --> 26:04.134
You'd need a lot of powder.

26:04.218 --> 26:07.262
- We'll be right back. Come on, hon.
- Okay.

26:13.684 --> 26:14.934
Honey...

26:15.477 --> 26:17.728
no matter how many beers
you buy me tonight...

26:17.812 --> 26:19.354
I'm not the one going home with you.

26:19.438 --> 26:21.606
- So concentrate on the one who might.
- What?

26:21.690 --> 26:24.108
You haven't said a word
to Jackson all night.

26:24.192 --> 26:25.609
- I haven't, have I?
- No.

26:25.693 --> 26:28.903
- I know, I'm just so nervous.
- You're nervous?

26:28.946 --> 26:31.322
You don't have a guy staring at you
like he's Cher...

26:31.406 --> 26:32.573
and you're the kid from Mask.

26:32.657 --> 26:34.074
I can't think of anything to say.

26:34.116 --> 26:36.159
- To Jackson?
- Yes, to Jackson.

26:36.243 --> 26:39.287
Yes, because to me, tonight,
there's been no off button.

26:39.621 --> 26:40.955
I just...

26:41.247 --> 26:43.915
This place is too fancy,
my hair is too tight...

26:43.999 --> 26:46.083
and this dress is all wrong.

26:46.167 --> 26:49.878
- And he looks really good, doesn't he?
- Yeah, he does.

26:50.170 --> 26:52.296
I know I'm being crazy.

26:52.380 --> 26:55.340
No, you're putting too much pressure
on this whole evening.

26:55.425 --> 26:57.968
Look, in five seconds,
I could take your hair down...

26:58.052 --> 26:59.594
we could go someplace more casual...

26:59.678 --> 27:02.096
and personally,
I think you're wrong about the dress.

27:02.180 --> 27:03.639
- Really?
- Yes.

27:03.806 --> 27:08.226
Come on, let's go to Luke's.
Have burgers, talk, relax.

27:08.476 --> 27:10.477
No pressure, no stress.

27:10.770 --> 27:14.147
Unless I wind up stepping on Rune,
which might be fun.

27:14.231 --> 27:16.274
- That would be great.
- Okay.

27:16.358 --> 27:17.859
- Come on.
- All right.

27:28.492 --> 27:32.036
Okay, what about movies?
You must have a favorite movie.

27:32.704 --> 27:35.414
- Yes, I do!
- Great. What is it?

27:35.498 --> 27:36.790
Beethoven.

27:37.499 --> 27:39.792
Beethoven? The one with the dog?

27:39.876 --> 27:42.711
There's this scene
where this little dog is running around...

27:42.795 --> 27:45.171
with a huge cabbage in its mouth.

27:45.255 --> 27:49.508
Man, it's classic.
I shot my Dr. Pepper right out of my nose!

27:50.092 --> 27:51.301
I swear.

28:06.522 --> 28:07.772
Welcome to Luke's.

28:07.856 --> 28:10.399
- This is much better.
- It is, isn't it?

28:10.483 --> 28:12.818
Grab a seat, I'll get the menus.

28:16.113 --> 28:17.906
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:18.531 --> 28:20.532
Four menus, one coffee,
and an anvil, please.

28:20.616 --> 28:21.783
What's the anvil for?

28:21.867 --> 28:23.493
- For Rune.
- What's a rune?

28:23.577 --> 28:26.746
- Please, not that question again.
- Okay.

28:31.750 --> 28:33.167
Here you go.

28:33.376 --> 28:36.503
- Mind if I hang out here a sec?
- Why? What's going on over there?

28:36.587 --> 28:38.797
Sookie and Jackson are on their first date.

28:38.880 --> 28:41.882
- Seems to be going well.
- I think I'd wear blue to the wedding.

28:41.966 --> 28:44.634
- Who's the other guy?
- Jackson's cousin. He's my date.

28:44.718 --> 28:46.928
- Lucky girl.
- Yes, I think so.

28:47.012 --> 28:50.473
He is, believe it or not, even less thrilled
with the matchup than I am.

28:50.556 --> 28:53.183
- You're kidding. Why?
- I'm too tall.

28:53.225 --> 28:54.976
- Get out.
- I'm serious.

28:55.060 --> 28:56.936
Doesn't he understand how great that is?

28:57.020 --> 28:58.979
You can get all the stuff
from the top shelf.

28:59.063 --> 29:01.273
That is exactly what I bring
to a relationship.

29:01.356 --> 29:03.566
Explain that to him, will you?

29:04.901 --> 29:08.362
Luke, that is
an exceptionally good batch of coffee.

29:08.445 --> 29:09.445
- Yeah?
- Hello!

29:09.529 --> 29:10.738
I added a little nutmeg.

29:10.822 --> 29:12.156
- Really?
- Yes.

29:12.240 --> 29:15.075
That's very Richard Simmons of you.

29:15.409 --> 29:18.828
What can I say?
Chicks dig a man with a feminine side.

29:20.913 --> 29:24.582
- Okay, I'm really bored.
- Sit down. We're about ready to order.

29:24.666 --> 29:28.168
I don't wanna order.
I don't wanna eat here. I wanna go.

29:28.252 --> 29:29.919
- Rune.
- Jackson.

29:30.004 --> 29:33.506
I came out with you tonight
under the impression that I'd have fun.

29:33.590 --> 29:35.299
First I get stuck with her.

29:35.383 --> 29:38.260
Then I get dragged to a French restaurant,
then out of it.

29:38.344 --> 29:41.012
- God knows where I am now.
- You're at Luke's.

29:43.056 --> 29:44.682
I've been very patient.

29:44.765 --> 29:46.891
Sunday night's almost over.
I wanna go bowling.

29:46.934 --> 29:50.228
- Well, I...
- And I'd like you to go bowling with me.

29:51.187 --> 29:52.396
Well...

29:53.731 --> 29:56.107
I guess we should...

30:01.320 --> 30:03.321
- Don't go!
- Really?

30:03.530 --> 30:07.241
Yes. Stay here. We haven't really
even started our date yet.

30:07.450 --> 30:09.743
No, we haven't.

30:11.745 --> 30:14.497
Sorry, Rune. You're on your own tonight.

30:15.289 --> 30:17.916
Fine! I'll just see you at home then.

30:20.460 --> 30:22.336
- Maybe.
- Bye, loon.

30:28.007 --> 30:29.257
Finally.

30:31.635 --> 30:33.761
Guess you'll only need three menus now.

30:33.804 --> 30:36.722
Why don't you make up
three fabulous cheeseburgers...

30:36.806 --> 30:38.807
and send two over there?
I'll have mine here.

30:38.891 --> 30:42.268
First I gotta watch a man walk out
on you, then watch you eat alone?

30:42.310 --> 30:43.519
Nope. Too pathetic.

30:43.603 --> 30:45.854
- I'm not eating alone. You're here.
- I'm working.

30:45.938 --> 30:47.856
But after three cheeseburgers,
you're done...

30:47.940 --> 30:51.234
- unless you're expecting Elijah to stop by.
- Okay, fine.

30:52.068 --> 30:55.320
- Five card draw.
- You're on.

31:09.165 --> 31:10.624
Give me four.

31:15.628 --> 31:16.795
No, four more.

31:16.879 --> 31:19.464
You can't have four more,
those are the four I dealt you.

31:19.548 --> 31:23.134
These don't help me, and I've vowed
to discard anything negative in my life.

31:23.217 --> 31:26.761
- First Rune, and now these four cards.
- Whatever you say.

31:27.512 --> 31:29.430
Much better. Thank you.

31:29.514 --> 31:31.140
Rune knew when to run away.

31:37.353 --> 31:39.271
- God, that's nice.
- Yep.

31:40.189 --> 31:43.483
The whole first date
beginning of the relationship glow.

31:43.567 --> 31:46.611
- Everything's new and exciting.
- Every joke is hilarious.

31:46.694 --> 31:49.070
Every little touch is incredible.

31:49.154 --> 31:51.614
- God, that's a good feeling.
- It is at that.

31:51.698 --> 31:54.199
- I miss that.
- You'll have it again.

31:55.576 --> 31:56.826
I guess.

32:01.831 --> 32:04.249
Maybe sometime we could...

32:06.710 --> 32:08.419
- Where are the girls?
- What?

32:08.503 --> 32:10.838
- Lane said she's with you and Rory.
- Slow down.

32:10.880 --> 32:13.090
I call, no answer.
I think they're at video store.

32:13.173 --> 32:15.925
I call again, no answer.
I call third time, no answer!

32:16.009 --> 32:18.344
- You had a lot of free time.
- Where are the girls?

32:18.385 --> 32:20.469
- They said they're going to a movie.
- With who?

32:20.554 --> 32:21.763
They were gonna meet Dean.

32:21.846 --> 32:24.389
A boy? You let them go with a boy?

32:24.474 --> 32:26.684
Mrs. Kim, Dean is Rory's boyfriend.

32:26.725 --> 32:30.311
Because you let your daughter run around
with boys doesn't mean I let mine.

32:30.395 --> 32:32.521
- I thought you knew.
- I didn't know!

32:32.605 --> 32:37.191
They could be anywhere, doing anything.
Smoking or drinking or buying drugs!

32:37.275 --> 32:39.318
They're at the movies.
There's no drugs there.

32:39.402 --> 32:41.153
They don't even have the real Red Vines.

32:41.237 --> 32:43.864
- I need to find them.
- I'm coming with.

32:53.955 --> 32:56.582
- Good flick.
- Yeah, not bad.

32:56.665 --> 32:58.082
Lane, what did you think?

32:58.167 --> 33:00.710
I think it's late
and I should be getting home.

33:00.794 --> 33:02.920
- Really?
- Yeah, but it's been fun.

33:03.004 --> 33:05.922
No, come on. Let's go get
some ice cream or something.

33:06.006 --> 33:09.550
Eat it really fast,
get that freezy brain thing going. It's cool.

33:09.634 --> 33:12.052
- So tempting, and yet...
- Lane Kim!

33:14.388 --> 33:15.972
- My mom.
- My mom.

33:16.181 --> 33:18.599
Two moms. That's gotta be bad.

33:18.683 --> 33:19.975
I was just about to...

33:21.143 --> 33:22.810
- Mom, I can...
- So not the time.

33:22.894 --> 33:24.228
- You lied to me.
- Sorry.

33:24.312 --> 33:25.813
Get home, right now!

33:26.897 --> 33:28.731
- Rough family.
- What's going on?

33:28.774 --> 33:31.692
Bits of information were left out
of the mom packets tonight.

33:31.776 --> 33:32.735
I'm sorry.

33:32.819 --> 33:36.029
Mother and daughter number two
are leaving now. Say bye, Rory.

33:36.113 --> 33:38.948
- Bye.
- I'll call you later.

33:40.366 --> 33:43.201
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Yeah. Bye, Dean.

33:44.244 --> 33:46.829
That's Rory's mom? She's a babe, man!

33:46.913 --> 33:49.081
- And what were you thinking?
- I know.

33:49.123 --> 33:51.249
You lied to me.
What's that nonsense all about?

33:51.333 --> 33:54.668
- I know I shouldn't have done that.
- Damn right, you shouldn't have.

33:54.752 --> 33:57.921
But Lane wanted to go out with Todd.
She couldn't tell her mother.

33:57.963 --> 34:00.548
So I didn't tell you
so you wouldn't have to lie for us.

34:00.632 --> 34:02.716
You lied to me
so I wouldn't lie to Mrs. Kim?

34:02.800 --> 34:04.801
- Yeah.
- My God. You really are my daughter.

34:04.885 --> 34:05.885
I'm sorry.

34:05.970 --> 34:09.054
I have to know where you are,
especially when you have my shoes on.

34:09.139 --> 34:10.139
I know.

34:10.223 --> 34:12.433
This trust thing only works
if it goes both ways.

34:12.475 --> 34:14.268
- I hated doing it.
- Good.

34:16.518 --> 34:17.811
- Would you have?
- What?

34:17.896 --> 34:19.313
- Lied for us?
- To Mrs. Kim?

34:19.397 --> 34:20.397
- Yeah.
- No.

34:20.481 --> 34:22.524
- Why?
- Because that lady's scary.

34:22.983 --> 34:25.775
I can't lie to another mother.
That's breaking the code.

34:25.818 --> 34:28.152
So what were we supposed to do tonight?

34:28.237 --> 34:30.989
I know Mrs. Kim
and Robert Duvall in The Great Santini...

34:31.072 --> 34:33.449
share a striking resemblance.
But she is Lane's mom.

34:33.533 --> 34:35.951
She has the right to tell her
she can't do something.

34:35.993 --> 34:38.870
You have to respect that
and I really have to respect that.

34:38.954 --> 34:41.414
- So we were in a no-win situation tonight?
- Yep.

34:41.496 --> 34:42.998
- Great.
- Sorry.

34:44.333 --> 34:46.583
You know the one good thing
we learned from this?

34:46.668 --> 34:48.543
- What?
- That I'm a babe.

35:09.978 --> 35:11.062
Hey.

35:12.021 --> 35:14.314
- What's up, Rapunzel?
- Don't take it the wrong way...

35:14.398 --> 35:17.108
but in all my fantasies
of who may appear at this window...

35:17.192 --> 35:18.818
you never actually made the list.

35:18.860 --> 35:21.028
So how are you?
I haven't heard from you in days.

35:21.112 --> 35:22.321
I'm okay, I guess.

35:22.404 --> 35:24.947
- I was afraid to call.
- I think that's best for now.

35:24.990 --> 35:26.282
Your mom's really mad?

35:26.366 --> 35:28.909
The words convent and Siberia
were used several times...

35:28.993 --> 35:30.619
and at least once as a combo.

35:30.703 --> 35:33.330
- I'm really sorry.
- It's not your fault.

35:33.371 --> 35:34.872
I shouldn't have arranged it.

35:34.956 --> 35:37.457
You arranged it because I asked,
and I'm glad you did.

35:37.541 --> 35:38.500
You are?

35:38.584 --> 35:41.586
If you hadn't set me up with Todd,
I'd still be in love with him.

35:41.669 --> 35:42.878
Not the guy for you?

35:42.962 --> 35:47.340
Or for anybody who can read, write,
talk, or function on a basic human level.

35:47.382 --> 35:48.507
I'm sorry.

35:48.592 --> 35:50.343
I was so bored I couldn't see straight.

35:50.385 --> 35:53.470
I've been on Korean meditation weekends
that have had more laughs.

35:53.554 --> 35:55.513
He liked you, though. Dean told me.

35:55.597 --> 35:57.223
- I know. He called.
- You're kidding.

35:57.307 --> 36:00.142
I pretended to be my mom
and wouldn't let me speak to him.

36:00.226 --> 36:02.894
- Was that mean?
- I think he'll survive.

36:03.436 --> 36:05.854
He and Dean went muffler shopping today.

36:05.897 --> 36:07.314
That's nice.

36:08.232 --> 36:11.276
- How long before you can get out?
- I don't know.

36:11.359 --> 36:14.569
I have to be in the house at all times,
except for school and church.

36:14.654 --> 36:17.364
- She didn't give you any time frame at all?
- Nope.

36:17.447 --> 36:19.657
- I miss you.
- I miss you, too.

36:20.325 --> 36:21.826
Is there anything I can do?

36:21.909 --> 36:24.452
Yeah. Don't tell anyone
I went out with Todd, okay?

36:24.536 --> 36:25.870
I promise.

36:26.163 --> 36:27.580
- I gotta go.
- Bye.

36:33.585 --> 36:34.752
You break, you buy.

36:34.836 --> 36:37.880
- But it was sticking out in the aisle.
- You break, you buy!

36:37.963 --> 36:39.547
I didn't put it in the aisle.

36:39.631 --> 36:41.382
- You have eyes?
- Yes.

36:41.466 --> 36:43.092
- These eyes work?
- Yes.

36:43.176 --> 36:46.470
- They can make out shapes, sizes, colors?
- Yes, they can do all that...

36:46.553 --> 36:49.513
Eyes work! They see lamp in aisle,
they send message to brain:

36:49.598 --> 36:52.016
'Lamp in aisle, move. '
You move, you don't break lamp.

36:52.058 --> 36:54.851
You have no eyes, not my problem,
it's between you and them.

36:54.935 --> 36:56.436
You break, you buy!

37:00.064 --> 37:01.898
We appreciate your business.

37:04.609 --> 37:06.527
- Hello.
- Hi.

37:07.236 --> 37:10.238
I was wondering if I could maybe
talk to you for a minute.

37:10.322 --> 37:11.739
- I'm working.
- Right.

37:11.782 --> 37:14.700
This is gonna be so quick,
you'll be amazed.

37:14.951 --> 37:16.285
Fine. Come.

37:23.833 --> 37:27.877
Look, I am really sorry
about what happened the other night.

37:28.420 --> 37:31.839
- Rory's never lied to me like that before.
- That you know of.

37:31.922 --> 37:35.966
No, I'm pretty sure that was the first time,
and it definitely was the last.

37:36.051 --> 37:38.969
- Fine.
- I just didn't want you to feel...

37:39.053 --> 37:42.472
like you couldn't send Lane
over to our house anymore.

37:42.931 --> 37:44.849
Because you can, believe me.

37:44.932 --> 37:48.101
Those girls go nowhere
without me knowing about it.

37:48.143 --> 37:52.187
In fact, I was thinking of having
some house arrest ankle bracelets made.

37:53.272 --> 37:56.524
Maybe cute ones
with a leopard print or zebra stripes.

37:56.608 --> 37:58.150
Maybe a little glitter design.

37:58.235 --> 38:00.653
Lane won't be coming over.
She'll stay in our house.

38:00.737 --> 38:04.573
I was talking about later. She's not
gonna be grounded forever, is she?

38:04.823 --> 38:07.283
Lane lied to me,
and she must be punished.

38:07.367 --> 38:08.993
I totally agree.

38:09.493 --> 38:10.952
But she's a really good kid.

38:10.995 --> 38:14.789
I don't think I've ever met a kid who
respects her parents more than Lane does.

38:14.831 --> 38:17.041
Lying is not showing respect.

38:18.292 --> 38:21.836
She's 16. She had a crush on a boy.

38:22.712 --> 38:25.630
Lane is not allowed to date boys
unless we have approved them.

38:25.673 --> 38:29.259
She knows our rules. She broke them.
That is unacceptable.

38:29.301 --> 38:31.302
Okay. Yes, you're right.

38:32.011 --> 38:33.845
But teenagers sometimes slip up.

38:33.929 --> 38:37.264
I don't care what teenagers do.
I care what Lane does.

38:37.307 --> 38:41.185
It doesn't always work to lock a kid up
and throw away the key.

38:41.268 --> 38:44.061
I didn't throw away the key.
It's in the kitchen.

38:44.562 --> 38:47.480
Okay. I was talking symbolically...

38:47.523 --> 38:49.941
but all right, I'm with you now.

38:51.318 --> 38:54.779
When I was a teenager,
my parents tried to keep me locked up.

38:54.862 --> 38:57.739
They tried to force me
to become what they had in mind.

38:57.823 --> 39:02.576
I'm not talking exactly about Lane here,
but in my case, it really didn't work.

39:03.244 --> 39:05.745
You blame your parents
for getting pregnant?

39:05.829 --> 39:09.498
No. I think if I'd had a little more space
or someone to listen to me...

39:09.582 --> 39:11.458
things might have turned out different.

39:11.542 --> 39:12.918
I got lucky.

39:13.418 --> 39:15.336
Because having Rory...

39:15.712 --> 39:18.380
Totally the best thing
that could have happened.

39:18.464 --> 39:19.965
But let's be honest.

39:20.049 --> 39:23.176
I certainly don't want Rory
to turn out like me.

39:23.259 --> 39:26.261
I don't want Lane
to turn out like you either.

39:27.096 --> 39:30.098
I believe that's the first thing
you and I have ever agreed on.

39:30.181 --> 39:33.850
- I just want Lane to be safe.
- I just want Rory to be safe.

39:37.312 --> 39:38.979
I'm gonna go now.

39:40.523 --> 39:45.193
I think you are doing a great job with Lane.
She's a really great kid.

39:45.235 --> 39:49.029
I just wanted to put my two cents in,
because that's what I do.

39:49.113 --> 39:50.197
Bye.

39:59.579 --> 40:02.581
I know, 'You break, you buy. '
I heard earlier.

40:03.249 --> 40:04.916
That's $35, right?

40:06.293 --> 40:08.669
An 'A' minus. I am very impressed.

40:08.753 --> 40:10.254
- Annoying boy in back of me...
- Yes?

40:10.338 --> 40:11.380
...'B' plus.
- Loser.

40:11.464 --> 40:13.423
I know. It's all very exciting.

40:14.007 --> 40:17.134
Did I tell you Sookie and Jackson
have another date tonight?

40:17.218 --> 40:19.428
- What is that, the third one this week?
- Yeah.

40:19.512 --> 40:21.263
- That is so great.
- I know it is.

40:21.346 --> 40:24.598
But if she tells me the story
of how Jackson cultivates mealworms...

40:24.682 --> 40:27.809
to help fertilize his plants again
I'm gonna Romeo and Juliet them.

40:27.893 --> 40:28.893
- It's sweet.
- Mealworms.

40:28.977 --> 40:30.603
Gross, but sweet.

40:31.521 --> 40:34.022
You know the rules:
No pages before French fries.

40:34.106 --> 40:35.690
- My God, it's Lane.
- You're kidding.

40:35.774 --> 40:37.066
Give me your cell phone, quick.

40:37.151 --> 40:38.985
- Where are you going?
- Outside.

40:39.069 --> 40:40.361
- Why?
- Luke hates cell phones.

40:40.403 --> 40:42.487
- So?
- I don't want to incur the wrath of Luke.

40:42.571 --> 40:44.113
- Why not? It's fun.
- I'll be back.

40:44.198 --> 40:45.574
Goody-goody.

40:57.416 --> 40:58.541
- Rory?
- Lane?

40:58.626 --> 41:02.962
- I'm standing in the yard!
- Oh, my God! She let you out?

41:03.046 --> 41:06.090
- I can go as far as the sign!
- That's so great!

41:10.677 --> 41:11.969
- Hi.
- Hey.

41:12.053 --> 41:15.180
I haven't seen you since the other night.
Everything okay?

41:15.264 --> 41:16.389
Yeah, fine.

41:16.431 --> 41:19.683
The dating world of 16-year-old girls.
Very exciting stuff.

41:19.767 --> 41:20.892
I bet.

41:24.104 --> 41:26.230
- Coffee?
- Do you have to ask?

41:28.733 --> 41:31.193
I had a good time the other night
with the cards.

41:31.276 --> 41:32.526
- Yeah. Me, too.
- Good.

41:32.611 --> 41:34.195
Yeah, in fact...

41:34.487 --> 41:37.280
you rushed out of here before...

41:38.198 --> 41:39.991
I had a chance to...

41:41.618 --> 41:42.994
A chance to?

41:45.996 --> 41:47.872
Kick your ass in poker.

41:49.165 --> 41:50.457
You wish.

41:52.001 --> 41:53.960
- Burger?
- Two, and fries.

41:55.170 --> 41:57.129
Maybe we could do it again sometime.

41:57.213 --> 42:00.006
Yeah, I would like that.

42:02.134 --> 42:03.134
Here.

42:03.218 --> 42:05.803
- Where are you going?
- Lane's allowed out for 15 minutes.

42:05.887 --> 42:07.805
I'm gonna yell at her from
across the street.

42:07.888 --> 42:09.555
- Still want your burger?
- I'll be back.

42:09.640 --> 42:11.266
Yell hi for me!
