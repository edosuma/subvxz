00:04.292 --> 00:05.855
Guys, I have amazing

00:05.856 --> 00:07.417
news! I just got

00:07.459 --> 00:09.000
- the lead in an
- off-Broadway play!

00:09.042 --> 00:10.417
That's awesome!

00:10.459 --> 00:11.918
- Your name will be
- up in lights!

00:12.250 --> 00:14.291
- Or in tiny print in - the back of the
- Program...

00:15.292 --> 00:16.876
- I'm the new
- understudy.

00:16.918 --> 00:18.439
The old one got hit

00:18.440 --> 00:19.959
by a bus and she's

00:16.918 --> 00:19.959
in a body cast for a year.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.626
- Can you
- believe the luck?

00:23.542 --> 00:25.396
So, basically you will be

00:25.397 --> 00:27.250
watching someone else

00:23.542 --> 00:27.250
perform the part.

00:27.292 --> 00:28.814

00:37.417 --> 00:38.626
The only downside is,

00:38.959 --> 00:41.160
- it's such a big hit, - I
can't get you guys - Tickets.

00:41.292 --> 00:43.000
- Sounds like a win-win
- to me!

00:45.042 --> 00:46.209
At least pretend to be sad.

00:46.709 --> 00:48.626

02:21.125 --> 02:23.000

Those bones made for

02:26.252 --> 02:27.459
a very unpleasant morning.

02:29.083 --> 02:31.042

02:34.125 --> 02:37.000
post it online, and the

02:37.042 --> 02:38.626
- video with the
- most votes wins.

02:39.083 --> 02:40.834
Soon, "Bertram Winkle" will

02:40.835 --> 02:42.584
be a household name.

02:43.083 --> 02:45.042
- He's barely a name
- in this household.

02:47.083 --> 02:48.083
His last name is Winkle?

02:50.500 --> 02:51.772
Well, if y'all don't

02:51.773 --> 02:53.042
look as busy as

02:50.500 --> 02:53.042
moths in a mitten!

02:53.083 --> 02:54.083
How is everyone

02:54.084 --> 02:55.084
this fine morning?

02:55.125 --> 02:56.563
A better question is

02:56.564 --> 02:58.000
why are you talking like

02:55.125 --> 02:58.000
everybody in The Help?

02:59.125 --> 03:00.313
As the

03:00.314 --> 03:01.500
understudy, I

02:59.125 --> 03:01.500
have to be ready.

03:01.542 --> 03:02.793
If the star gets the sniffles,

03:02.794 --> 03:04.042
or an ingrown toenail,

- to the exact minute

03:08.125 --> 03:09.584
They took her...

03:09.585 --> 03:11.042
I'll go on for Susan

03:08.125 --> 03:11.042
Channing!

03:12.667 --> 03:13.834
Hindi. You are the understudy

03:13.835 --> 03:15.000
for Susan Channing?

03:15.167 --> 03:17.125
- She is my favorite - theater actress
- Ever!

03:17.167 --> 03:19.042
- I even have
- her trading card.

03:19.083 --> 03:20.042
They make those?

03:20.083 --> 03:22.584
Actually, I made it myself.

03:23.083 --> 03:24.522
Okay, that's

03:24.523 --> 03:25.959
not creepy at all.

03:26.751 --> 03:28.476
- On the bright side,
- if he has a trading card,

03:28.500 --> 03:29.710
That must mean he finally

03:29.711 --> 03:30.918
found a friend

03:28.500 --> 03:30.918
to trade with.

03:35.751 --> 03:37.000
- And we're
- whisking...

03:38.167 --> 03:39.417
We're whisking...

03:42.083 --> 03:43.083
- (BOTH SNORING)
- Hey!

03:44.709 --> 03:45.751
What do you

03:45.752 --> 03:46.792
guys think of my

03:44.709 --> 03:46.792
audition video?

03:46.834 --> 03:48.480
To tell the truth,

03:48.481 --> 03:50.125
It made me yearn for one

03:46.834 --> 03:50.125
of Jessie's boyfriend stories.

03:51.876 --> 03:53.059
- It doesn't need to be
- exciting.

03:53.083 --> 03:54.810
- What matters is the
- quality of my cooking.

03:54.834 --> 03:56.147
You can't reach through

03:56.148 --> 03:57.459
the TV and eat food.

03:57.918 --> 03:59.834
- Not that we haven't
- caught you trying.

04:00.083 --> 04:02.042
Ever since we got that

04:02.043 --> 04:04.000
3D screen, I can't help

04:00.083 --> 04:04.000
myself!

04:05.083 --> 04:06.772
What you need is a

04:06.773 --> 04:08.459
gimmick. Cooking shows

04:05.083 --> 04:08.459
are all about style.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.022
Luckily, style over

04:10.023 --> 04:11.042
substance is my

04:09.000 --> 04:11.042
middle name!

04:11.083 --> 04:12.542
That must make for

04:12.543 --> 04:14.000
quite a monogram.

04:15.125 --> 04:16.500
Look, if you really want

04:16.502 --> 04:17.875
your web show to blow up,

04:17.918 --> 04:19.293
let me produce it.

04:19.293 --> 04:20.666
I've got some totes

04:17.918 --> 04:20.666
awesome ideas.

04:21.083 --> 04:22.709
- I promise, you'll be
- in good hands!

04:24.167 --> 04:26.146
(GROANS) Well, I know

04:26.147 --> 04:28.125
I'm going to regret this,

04:24.167 --> 04:28.125
but... Fine.

04:28.709 --> 04:31.147
So the plan is

04:31.148 --> 04:33.584
to combine your charisma

04:28.709 --> 04:33.584
with Emma's brains?

04:34.000 --> 04:35.750
Why don't you just throw in

04:35.751 --> 04:37.500
Luke's book smarts

04:34.000 --> 04:37.500
and Ravi's popularity?

04:42.042 --> 04:43.042
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS)

04:45.250 --> 04:46.959
Luke, did you

04:46.960 --> 04:48.667
enjoy this

04:45.250 --> 04:48.667
as much as I did?

04:48.709 --> 04:50.667
- No, I'm just
- glad it's over.

04:52.083 --> 04:54.042
- They couldn't have
- thrown in one ninja?

04:54.083 --> 04:55.605
Yeah, because Alabama

04:55.606 --> 04:57.125
in the 1940s was just

04:54.083 --> 04:57.125
crawling with ninjas!

04:58.667 --> 05:00.814
If it was, no one would

05:00.815 --> 05:02.959
have known, because

04:58.667 --> 05:02.959
they're ninjas.

05:04.626 --> 05:06.876
Listen to that ovation!

05:06.918 --> 05:08.584
- You were wonderful,
- Miss Channing.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.042
Your performance has

05:10.043 --> 05:11.043
moved me to tears.

05:11.083 --> 05:12.542
Who are you people?

05:12.543 --> 05:14.000
And why are you making

05:11.083 --> 05:14.000
eye contact with me?

05:16.042 --> 05:17.167
Miss Channing, I'm

your new understudy,

05:16.042 --> 05:18.292
Jessie Prescott.

05:18.334 --> 05:20.209
- Ah, then prepare
- to die of boredom.

05:20.250 --> 05:21.834
I don't need an understudy.

05:21.876 --> 05:23.356
- I have never missed
- a performance.

05:24.542 --> 05:26.143
- And I never gave - a lizard a pedicure
- Until a few years ago.

05:26.167 --> 05:28.000
- Life is full
- of surprises.

05:28.834 --> 05:30.480
Not for me. I've had

05:30.481 --> 05:32.125
perfect attendance,

05:28.834 --> 05:32.125
ever since my first role

05:32.167 --> 05:33.189
as Baby New Year

05:33.190 --> 05:34.209
at Radio City.

05:35.083 --> 05:36.563
On show night I had

05:36.564 --> 05:38.042
an upset tummy, but

05:35.083 --> 05:38.042
even as a pooper,

05:38.083 --> 05:39.083
I was a trooper.

05:40.876 --> 05:42.563
Miss Channing, please will

05:42.564 --> 05:44.250
you be so kind as to sign

05:40.876 --> 05:44.250
my trading card?

05:44.751 --> 05:45.897
Oh, sorry. If I gave

05:45.898 --> 05:47.042
you an autograph,

05:47.083 --> 05:48.643
- I'd have to give them
- to all my fans.

05:48.667 --> 05:50.334
- And then where
- would I be?

05:50.375 --> 05:52.096
- Thanking the people
- who made you famous?

05:53.083 --> 05:55.042
It would never end!

05:56.876 --> 05:58.059
- So, what have
- we learned today?

05:58.083 --> 05:59.334
That I am not special?

06:01.167 --> 06:03.646
Exactly. But you

06:03.647 --> 06:06.125

06:10.918 --> 06:13.000

06:13.334 --> 06:14.667

07:51.085 --> 07:52.167
are rolling in.

07:53.167 --> 07:55.167
"This video is

07:55.168 --> 07:57.167
so bad, it puts the

07:53.167 --> 07:57.167
'why' in wi-fi."

07:58.542 --> 08:01.189
Here's another

08:01.190 --> 08:03.834
bad one, "This show stinks,"

07:58.542 --> 08:03.834
from Zurigurl300?

08:04.876 --> 08:06.000
Tell me I'm wrong.

08:10.083 --> 08:12.542
Gather, gather. Everyone, I

08:12.543 --> 08:15.000
have an announcement.

08:15.417 --> 08:16.459
Miss Channing won't be

08:16.460 --> 08:17.500
able to make the show

08:17.542 --> 08:18.876
because she's been

08:18.877 --> 08:20.209
in a terrible accident.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.500
Yes!

08:26.125 --> 08:28.313
Kids! Get down here!

08:28.314 --> 08:30.500
I'm about to make my

08:26.125 --> 08:30.500
off-Broadway debut!

08:31.500 --> 08:33.042
- You can do your
- homework later!

08:33.082 --> 08:34.082
This is important!

08:35.500 --> 08:37.058
- I can't believe
- I'm actually going on.

08:37.082 --> 08:38.417
I forgot my lines.

08:38.458 --> 08:40.417
- I forgot my name!
- It's Desiree Peacock.

08:40.458 --> 08:41.813
No, I mean

08:41.813 --> 08:43.167
my actual name!

08:40.458 --> 08:43.167
It's Jessie.

08:43.208 --> 08:44.918
Oh. Oh, that's pretty.

08:48.959 --> 08:50.501
We're here!

08:50.502 --> 08:52.042
Guys! This is so

08:48.959 --> 08:52.042
sweet of you...

08:52.334 --> 08:53.855
"Get well soon,

08:53.856 --> 08:55.375
Susan. No one

08:52.334 --> 08:55.375
can take your place?"

08:57.125 --> 08:59.063
Uh, those are not

08:59.064 --> 09:01.000
for you. But would you

08:57.125 --> 09:01.000
care to sign the card?

09:02.125 --> 09:03.792
(PANTING) Stop!

09:05.042 --> 09:06.251
I couldn't find a cab

09:06.252 --> 09:07.459
from the hospital, so I

09:05.042 --> 09:07.459
grabbed this skateboard,

09:07.500 --> 09:08.918
held onto the back of the

09:08.919 --> 09:10.334
104 bus, and got here

09:07.500 --> 09:10.334
as fast as I could.

09:11.375 --> 09:12.626
Now, gimme my costume!

09:12.667 --> 09:13.834
Are you sure you

09:13.835 --> 09:15.000
don't want me to go

09:12.667 --> 09:15.000
on for you?

09:15.209 --> 09:17.042
- I mean, you're in
- a neck brace...

09:17.083 --> 09:19.564
- And your left eye is - kind of staring
- At your right eye...

09:20.083 --> 09:21.667
I told you, I never

09:21.668 --> 09:23.250
miss a performance.

09:20.083 --> 09:23.250
You can't fill my shoes.

09:23.667 --> 09:25.042
- Now, get out
- of my shoes!

09:29.083 --> 09:31.042
- Which are now stretched
- beyond recognition!

09:31.083 --> 09:32.250
Thanks a lot, Sasquatch!

09:39.209 --> 09:41.167
- I still think my - rapper idea was
- Awesome.

09:41.542 --> 09:43.231
Well, every single person

09:43.232 --> 09:44.918
on the internet disagreed.

09:49.042 --> 09:51.209
Wow.

09:51.250 --> 09:52.730
I know. Doesn't he

09:52.731 --> 09:54.209
look adorable?

09:55.292 --> 09:57.125
- Somebody get
- me a rope.

09:57.167 --> 09:58.125
So you can do rope tricks?

09:58.167 --> 09:59.417
Yeah. That's why.

10:01.250 --> 10:04.125
And... Action!

10:05.125 --> 10:06.209
Howdy, barbecuin'

10:06.210 --> 10:07.292
buckaroos.

10:07.334 --> 10:09.667
Today I'm gonna show y'all

10:09.668 --> 10:12.000
how to make every

10:07.334 --> 10:12.000
cowboy's favorite,

10:12.125 --> 10:13.959
Five-Alarm Chili.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
It'll leave you rootin'

10:16.001 --> 10:18.000
and tootin'...

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
(LAUGHS) Literally.

10:23.083 --> 10:24.459
Howdy, y'all!

10:24.500 --> 10:25.918
I'm his pard'ner in

10:25.919 --> 10:27.334
cookin' crime,

10:24.500 --> 10:27.334
Calamity Zuri!

10:27.375 --> 10:29.209
Hey, good accent.

10:29.250 --> 10:30.855
Thanks! This is how

10:30.856 --> 10:32.459
Jessie talks in her sleep.

10:34.542 --> 10:36.834
First, y'all are gonna

10:36.835 --> 10:39.125
need is a big pot of

10:34.542 --> 10:39.125
boilin' water on the stove.

10:39.542 --> 10:41.459
- Then, you gotta
- get your beans.

10:43.209 --> 10:45.126
Whoa, Nelly. These chaps

10:45.127 --> 10:47.042
are chafing something fierce.

10:48.542 --> 10:50.313
And that, folks, is

10:50.314 --> 10:52.083
what we call a

10:48.542 --> 10:52.083
heapin' helpin' of TMI.

10:55.626 --> 10:57.543
Hurry up! Don't make

10:57.544 --> 10:59.459
Calamity Zuri get

10:55.626 --> 10:59.459
her cattle prod.

11:00.417 --> 11:02.814
I'm trying, but my

11:02.815 --> 11:05.209
spur is stuck...

11:08.083 --> 11:09.147
Puttin' the beans

11:09.148 --> 11:10.209
in the boilin' water...

11:13.167 --> 11:14.584
(YELLS)

11:16.667 --> 11:19.084
Uh, sorry buckaroos.

11:19.085 --> 11:21.500
Just sit tight while we...

11:22.209 --> 11:24.209
Oh, never mind, just cut it.

11:27.626 --> 11:28.834
Okay, how bad are

11:28.835 --> 11:30.042
the comments?

11:32.375 --> 11:34.209
Well, let's just say

11:34.210 --> 11:36.042
you're wanted in Texas,

11:32.375 --> 11:36.042
dead or alive.

11:36.083 --> 11:37.667
Mostly dead.

11:41.375 --> 11:43.056
- Miss Channing, what
- are you doing here?

11:43.083 --> 11:44.209
I was invited

11:44.210 --> 11:45.334
by Morgan Ross.

11:45.375 --> 11:46.459
What are you doing here?

11:46.500 --> 11:47.522
I was also invited

11:47.523 --> 11:48.542
by Morgan Ross.

11:48.584 --> 11:50.167
- Three years ago.
- To be his son.

11:52.083 --> 11:53.730
Hi, Susan. I'm Luke,

11:53.731 --> 11:55.375
Morgan Ross's

11:52.083 --> 11:55.375
other son.

11:55.626 --> 11:57.355
Dad just phoned to say

11:57.356 --> 11:59.083
he's super excited to talk

11:55.626 --> 11:59.083
to you about starring

11:59.125 --> 12:01.083
- in his next summer
- blockbuster.

12:01.125 --> 12:02.083
He did?

12:02.125 --> 12:03.542
Yes, he did.

12:04.626 --> 12:06.209
- But he's running
- a little late.

12:06.250 --> 12:07.709
How late? In two

12:07.710 --> 12:09.167
hours I have an

12:06.250 --> 12:09.167
audience to enchant.

12:09.209 --> 12:10.251
Oh, he won't

12:10.252 --> 12:11.292
be too long.

12:11.334 --> 12:13.167
- Why don't you wait
- on the terrace?

12:13.209 --> 12:14.334
Oh. Very well.

12:17.334 --> 12:18.751
I thought Mr. Daddy was

12:18.752 --> 12:20.167
in Nashville shooting

12:17.334 --> 12:20.167
that country music

12:20.209 --> 12:21.605
exploitation film,

12:21.606 --> 12:23.000
Banjo Unchained.

12:23.250 --> 12:24.375
(SHUSHING)

12:24.417 --> 12:25.480
He is. I tricked

12:25.481 --> 12:26.542
Susan into coming.

12:27.250 --> 12:28.959
So now all you've got

12:28.960 --> 12:30.667
to do is distract her with

12:27.250 --> 12:30.667
annoying fan boy questions

12:30.709 --> 12:32.668
until she misses her

12:32.669 --> 12:34.626
performance and

12:30.709 --> 12:34.626
Jessie goes on instead!

12:35.083 --> 12:37.042
Done! I cannot wait to probe

12:37.043 --> 12:39.000
the very depths of her soul!

12:40.500 --> 12:41.876
I asked you to keep

12:41.877 --> 12:43.250
her here, not to

12:40.500 --> 12:43.250
scare her away.

12:43.292 --> 12:44.292
No probing!

12:48.584 --> 12:50.480
And that's how, at nine

12:50.481 --> 12:52.375
years old, I ended up

12:48.584 --> 12:52.375
writing my memoirs,

12:52.417 --> 12:54.000
Binky to Broadway.

12:55.167 --> 12:56.584
- Look, I really
- must be going...

12:57.083 --> 12:58.397
Please, just one

12:58.398 --> 12:59.709
more question!

12:59.751 --> 13:01.168
I have always wondered

13:01.169 --> 13:02.584
how you prepare

12:59.751 --> 13:02.584
for a role.

13:02.834 --> 13:04.710
Well, my preparation

13:04.711 --> 13:06.584
involves retiring

13:02.834 --> 13:06.584
to a cave upstate

13:06.626 --> 13:07.834
and living amongst

13:07.835 --> 13:09.042
woodland creatures.

13:09.083 --> 13:10.647
Short story long, I lost

13:10.648 --> 13:12.209
three toes to a badger.

13:14.292 --> 13:15.730
Oh, and when you...

13:15.731 --> 13:17.167
Look, as much as I love

13:14.292 --> 13:17.167
talking about myself,

13:17.209 --> 13:18.209
I really must get

13:18.210 --> 13:19.210
to the theater.

13:19.542 --> 13:21.042
Tell your father the curtain

13:21.043 --> 13:22.542
waits for no man, and

13:19.542 --> 13:22.542
neither do I!

13:24.167 --> 13:25.917
Stop that! What are

13:25.918 --> 13:27.667
you doing with

13:24.167 --> 13:27.667
those handcuffs?

13:27.709 --> 13:29.480
Making my nanny's

13:29.481 --> 13:31.250
dreams come true.

13:34.125 --> 13:35.209
What have you done?

13:35.250 --> 13:36.250
Nothing! I am an

13:36.251 --> 13:37.251
unwitting accomplice!

13:37.292 --> 13:38.960
If you knew me, you would

13:38.961 --> 13:40.626
know that I am often

13:37.292 --> 13:40.626
the unwitting accomplice!

13:42.083 --> 13:43.584
(GRUNTING)

13:46.292 --> 13:47.459
It's locked!

13:49.167 --> 13:50.230
So, you thought you could

13:50.231 --> 13:51.292
distract me by making me

13:49.167 --> 13:51.292
talk about myself.

13:51.876 --> 13:53.376
What kind of self-centered,

13:53.377 --> 13:54.876
egomaniac do you think I am?

13:54.918 --> 13:56.042
(GASPS)

13:56.083 --> 13:57.375
Would you look at that?

13:57.417 --> 13:58.647
Even desperate

13:58.648 --> 13:59.876
and fearful, I'm stunning.

14:02.334 --> 14:03.876
We just wanted our nanny,

14:03.877 --> 14:05.417
Jessie, to get her

14:02.334 --> 14:05.417
chance on stage!

14:05.751 --> 14:07.251
Jessie! You

14:07.252 --> 14:08.751
mean my understudy?

14:09.334 --> 14:10.792
Ooh, by the time I get

14:10.793 --> 14:12.250
done with her, I'll make

14:09.334 --> 14:12.250
sure she has

14:12.292 --> 14:14.085
a role in Fiddle Dee Die...

14:14.086 --> 14:15.876
As the corpse!

14:16.751 --> 14:18.938
Your flair for dramatic

14:18.939 --> 14:21.125
dialogue has me simultaneously

14:16.751 --> 14:21.125
terrified and tingly!

14:23.334 --> 14:24.626
You got any threes?

14:25.626 --> 14:27.042
I know you're cheating.

14:29.375 --> 14:30.438
Jessie, you're on!

14:30.439 --> 14:31.500
Susan's not coming!

14:32.083 --> 14:33.375
- Yes, she is.
- No, she's not!

14:33.417 --> 14:34.727
- How do you know?
- Because I handcuffed her

14:34.751 --> 14:36.459
- To a chair on - our terrace.
- You what?

14:37.125 --> 14:38.250
I know it sounds bad,

14:38.251 --> 14:39.375
but I did it for us!

14:39.417 --> 14:40.730
I didn't want our future

14:40.731 --> 14:42.042
children to have a failed

14:39.417 --> 14:42.042
actress as a mother!

14:43.584 --> 14:44.792
Luke! This is completely

14:44.793 --> 14:46.000
unacceptable!

14:46.042 --> 14:47.292
I'm going to take you

14:47.293 --> 14:48.542
straight home and

14:46.042 --> 14:48.542
ground you...

14:48.584 --> 14:50.417
Five minutes to curtain!

14:50.459 --> 14:51.771
Right after I go out

14:51.772 --> 14:53.083
there and give the

14:50.459 --> 14:53.083
performance of my life.

14:53.125 --> 14:54.876
They'll never forget

14:54.877 --> 14:56.626
the first time

14:53.125 --> 14:56.626
they saw Jessie...

14:56.667 --> 14:58.751
Now it's four minutes!

14:58.792 --> 15:00.356
Get into your costume, or

15:00.357 --> 15:01.918
I will play that part myself!

15:03.292 --> 15:05.250
- Back off, pal.
- This is my moment!

15:08.792 --> 15:10.459
- I would've killed
- in that role.

15:16.250 --> 15:17.375
Ugh. They put in

15:17.376 --> 15:18.500
too much salt.

15:19.876 --> 15:21.375
- So, how do we
- look?

15:21.876 --> 15:23.209
Like cute, little,

15:23.210 --> 15:24.542
show-stealing back-stabbers.

15:26.083 --> 15:27.250
He thinks we look cute!

15:27.292 --> 15:29.209
I can't believe I'm

15:29.210 --> 15:31.125
working behind the

15:27.292 --> 15:31.125
scenes on my own show.

15:31.167 --> 15:32.667
Well, after trying to

15:32.668 --> 15:34.167
make you a star,

15:34.209 --> 15:35.376
we realized where

15:35.377 --> 15:36.542
we both went wrong.

15:36.584 --> 15:37.897
It was the part where

15:37.898 --> 15:39.209
we tried to make

15:36.584 --> 15:39.209
you a star.

15:40.167 --> 15:41.251
But you don't

15:41.252 --> 15:42.334
even know

15:40.167 --> 15:42.334
how to cook!

15:42.375 --> 15:43.397
You do it every day.

15:43.398 --> 15:44.417
How hard can it be?

15:45.083 --> 15:46.292
Fine.

15:47.083 --> 15:48.125
And...

15:48.626 --> 15:49.918
Action.

BOTH: We're

15:51.690 --> 15:53.417
the Sizzle Sisters!

15:54.000 --> 15:55.793
And we're going to show

15:55.794 --> 15:57.584
you how to make the most

15:54.000 --> 15:57.584
glamorous pizza ever.

15:58.167 --> 15:59.438
First, you roll

15:59.439 --> 16:00.709
out the dough.

16:00.751 --> 16:02.647
Which we've pre-purchased

16:02.648 --> 16:04.542
at our local supermarket.

16:04.584 --> 16:06.500
(SCOFFS)

16:06.542 --> 16:08.167
Sizzle Sister tip number one,

16:08.168 --> 16:09.792
cover your cutting board

16:06.542 --> 16:09.792
with a layer of flour.

16:12.250 --> 16:13.250
(BOTH COUGHING)

16:14.334 --> 16:15.334
Then, you gotta

16:15.335 --> 16:16.335
twirl your dough.

16:17.459 --> 16:19.106
Higher! Higher!

16:19.107 --> 16:20.751
Higher!

16:24.250 --> 16:25.250
Well, while we wait

16:25.251 --> 16:26.251
for that to land,

16:29.292 --> 16:30.834
- let's check on one
- we made earlier.

16:32.918 --> 16:34.250
(BEEPING)

16:34.292 --> 16:35.606
Bertram! Why didn't this

16:35.607 --> 16:36.918
stupid oven get hot?

16:37.083 --> 16:38.147
Umm... Because

16:38.148 --> 16:39.209
it's a dishwasher.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.897
Uh-oh. I put a frozen

16:42.898 --> 16:44.292
pizza in here!

16:45.792 --> 16:47.209
(SCREAMING)

16:51.459 --> 16:53.042
Real smooth, Emma.

16:53.083 --> 16:54.083
(SHRIEKS)

16:54.334 --> 16:55.542
(LAUGHING)

16:58.834 --> 17:01.293
Help! Escaped,

17:01.294 --> 17:03.751
enraged actress trying

16:58.834 --> 17:03.751
to throttle me!

17:04.083 --> 17:05.959
Give me back my phone!

17:06.000 --> 17:07.500
Help me!

17:08.334 --> 17:10.000
- (STAMMERING) You're
- Susan Channing!

17:11.083 --> 17:12.917
- I loved you in
- Valley of Dead Swans.

17:13.459 --> 17:15.041
Careful! She is a biter!

17:15.083 --> 17:17.000
Someone stop her!

17:17.041 --> 17:18.041
I got this.

17:21.959 --> 17:23.291
(SHRIEKING)

17:23.334 --> 17:24.733
- ZURI: I think our
- sauce is done.

17:26.791 --> 17:27.791
(SHRIEKS)

17:28.083 --> 17:29.418
I'm covered in

17:29.419 --> 17:30.751
over-salted sauce!

17:30.792 --> 17:31.834
Told ya.

17:32.959 --> 17:34.001
And now I'm late

17:34.002 --> 17:35.042
to the theater.

17:35.083 --> 17:37.000
Could things get any worse?

17:40.292 --> 17:41.668
I know you did your pour

17:41.669 --> 17:43.042
husband in then used him

17:43.083 --> 17:44.250
to fertilize the begonias.

17:45.459 --> 17:47.230
Which was not only

17:47.231 --> 17:49.000
unladylike, but

17:45.459 --> 17:49.000
downright messy!

17:51.083 --> 17:53.042
- I gotta admit,
- Jessie's good.

17:53.083 --> 17:54.355
And I'm not just saying

17:54.356 --> 17:55.626
that because she's

17:53.083 --> 17:55.626
my future wife.

17:57.375 --> 17:59.000
Yeah, you heard me.

18:00.667 --> 18:02.230
Ah, dream big, kid.

18:02.231 --> 18:03.792
That's what I did.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.209
Now if you'll excuse me,

18:06.210 --> 18:08.334
I have to go empty the trash

18:04.083 --> 18:08.334
in the dressing rooms.

18:10.334 --> 18:11.334
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

18:14.042 --> 18:16.000
Oh, no! Susan escaped?

18:16.500 --> 18:18.042
I've gotta warn Jessie!

18:18.083 --> 18:19.355
Oh, save your tears

18:19.356 --> 18:20.626
for the judge.

18:20.667 --> 18:21.834
Detective Beauregard,

18:21.835 --> 18:23.000
take her away!

18:23.417 --> 18:25.396
Um, excuse me, sir,

18:25.397 --> 18:27.375
your mustache looks

18:23.417 --> 18:27.375
a little crooked...

18:32.375 --> 18:33.375
Yes!

18:34.375 --> 18:35.709
Ah, man. I really wish

18:35.710 --> 18:37.042
I'd been paying attention

18:37.083 --> 18:38.209
Jessie told me what

18:38.210 --> 18:39.334
this play was about.

18:41.584 --> 18:44.959
I said, take her away!

18:46.083 --> 18:48.000
- Whenever it's
- convenient for you!

18:54.083 --> 18:55.563
(IN BAD SOUTHERN ACCENT)

18:55.564 --> 18:57.042
I say, I say, Detective

18:54.083 --> 18:57.042
Beauregard is here.

18:57.083 --> 18:58.834
With some very

18:58.835 --> 19:00.584
important information!

19:02.083 --> 19:04.209
Detective Beauregard,

19:04.210 --> 19:06.334
you're late. And short.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.334
(LAUGHING)

19:09.709 --> 19:10.959
You!

19:11.876 --> 19:12.938
Wow, she made good time

19:12.939 --> 19:14.000
with that chair.

19:14.876 --> 19:15.876
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS)

19:19.000 --> 19:20.601
- What do you have to
- say for yourself?

19:22.083 --> 19:23.083
Line?

19:24.083 --> 19:26.042
This woman is an imposter

19:26.043 --> 19:28.000
and a con artist!

19:28.626 --> 19:30.042
That is disgraceful!

19:30.083 --> 19:31.542
I do declare, I should

19:31.543 --> 19:33.000
take you to the hoosegow!

19:35.083 --> 19:36.542
Ow! I think you ripped

19:36.543 --> 19:38.000
off a few freckles.

19:39.626 --> 19:40.709
You!

19:40.751 --> 19:42.125
- Feel free to
- keep the chair.

19:42.167 --> 19:43.417
Bye!

19:45.167 --> 19:46.605
Okay. This is all a

19:46.606 --> 19:48.042
giant misunderstanding.

19:48.083 --> 19:50.042
I am not a con artist!

19:50.083 --> 19:51.418
Oh, really? What do

19:51.419 --> 19:52.751
you call a person

19:50.083 --> 19:52.751
who pretends to be

19:52.792 --> 19:53.897
someone she's not

19:53.898 --> 19:55.000
in order to fool

19:52.792 --> 19:55.000
an audience?

19:55.709 --> 19:56.792
An actress?

19:57.792 --> 19:59.189
So you deny you

19:59.190 --> 20:00.584
wanted my role?

20:00.626 --> 20:02.834
Well, no. Of course

20:02.835 --> 20:05.042
I wanted it!

20:05.083 --> 20:08.563
But, Miss Channing, surely

20:08.564 --> 20:12.042
you can understand

20:05.083 --> 20:12.042
a young actress's desire

20:12.083 --> 20:13.563
to have her chance

20:13.564 --> 20:15.042
in the spotlight,

20:15.083 --> 20:18.751
just one shining moment...

20:18.792 --> 20:20.126
As someone who was

20:20.127 --> 20:21.459
once a talented

20:18.792 --> 20:21.459
beginner yourself,

20:21.500 --> 20:24.251
can't you find it in

20:24.252 --> 20:27.000
your heart to forgive

20:21.500 --> 20:27.000
a colleague? A fan?

20:27.626 --> 20:28.834
Dare I say...

20:28.835 --> 20:30.042
A new friend?

20:31.125 --> 20:32.584
Security!

20:34.751 --> 20:36.105
Does this mean I can't

20:36.106 --> 20:37.459
go to the cast party?

20:42.083 --> 20:43.563
We are very sorry

20:43.564 --> 20:45.042
we got you fired

20:42.083 --> 20:45.042
from the play, Jessie.

20:45.083 --> 20:46.418
Luckily, there was

20:46.419 --> 20:47.751
no real harm done.

20:48.083 --> 20:49.438
No harm done?

20:49.439 --> 20:50.792
Tell that to my career!

20:50.834 --> 20:52.042
And the terrace door!

20:53.709 --> 20:55.083
- How did she even
- break through?

20:55.125 --> 20:57.000
- She put a flower pot
- on my head

20:57.042 --> 20:59.000
- And used me as
- a human battering ram.

21:00.250 --> 21:02.209
I am definitely not paying

21:02.210 --> 21:04.167
my Susan Channing Fan Club

21:00.250 --> 21:04.167
dues this month.

21:05.751 --> 21:06.918
That'll show her.

21:07.959 --> 21:08.980
You guys know I have

21:08.981 --> 21:10.000
to punish you, right?

21:10.083 --> 21:12.000
- What you did to Susan
- was really wrong.

21:13.125 --> 21:14.584
That said, thank you

21:14.585 --> 21:16.042
so much for trying

21:13.125 --> 21:16.042
to help me.

21:16.083 --> 21:17.924
- I know your hearts
- were in the right place.

21:18.083 --> 21:19.376
After that crash through

21:19.377 --> 21:20.667
the door, mine may not be.

21:20.918 --> 21:22.792
- I have a heartbeat
- in my heinie.

21:24.167 --> 21:26.059
- Just promise me you'll never
- try to help me again

21:26.083 --> 21:27.147
By holding someone

21:27.148 --> 21:28.209
against their will.

21:28.250 --> 21:30.000
BOTH: We promise.

21:31.083 --> 21:32.683
- Unless it's for
- a major movie role...

21:33.876 --> 21:35.584
In which case, use

21:35.585 --> 21:37.292
a sturdy rope in a

21:33.876 --> 21:37.292
room with no windows.

21:37.334 --> 21:38.584
Amateurs.

21:42.083 --> 21:43.459
- Bertram,
- guess what?

21:44.083 --> 21:45.605
The Sizzle Sisters got

21:45.606 --> 21:47.125
the most votes

21:44.083 --> 21:47.125
of any video,

21:47.167 --> 21:48.543
so Emma and I won

21:48.544 --> 21:49.918
the contest!

21:50.083 --> 21:51.147
You're kidding! But

21:51.148 --> 21:52.209
it was a disaster.

21:52.250 --> 21:55.042
Exactly! A celebrity disaster!

21:55.083 --> 21:56.147
"Diva Gets Dumped On"

21:56.148 --> 21:57.209
went viral.

21:57.250 --> 21:58.250
We're right up there

21:58.251 --> 21:59.250
with those goats that

21:57.250 --> 21:59.250
scream like humans!

22:00.083 --> 22:01.626
(SCREAMS)

22:04.667 --> 22:06.083
Yep. That's them.

22:07.876 --> 22:09.956
- We're really sorry - we stole your show,
- Bertram.

22:10.083 --> 22:11.709
Yeah, me too.

22:11.751 --> 22:13.230
Plus, I've got flour in

22:13.231 --> 22:14.709
crevices I'll never be

22:11.751 --> 22:14.709
able to reach.

22:14.751 --> 22:15.876
Please tell me you

22:15.877 --> 22:17.000
mean behind the fridge.

22:18.334 --> 22:19.543
To make it up to you,

22:19.544 --> 22:20.751
we're going to clean

22:18.334 --> 22:20.751
all this up.

22:21.167 --> 22:23.125
Please, let me.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.022
Aww, because

22:25.023 --> 22:26.042
you forgive us?

22:26.083 --> 22:27.605
No. Because you're

22:27.606 --> 22:29.125
putting dirty plates

22:26.083 --> 22:29.125
in the oven.
