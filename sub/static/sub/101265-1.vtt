WEBVTT

01:37.295 --> 01:38.563
Whoo.

01:38.596 --> 01:40.666
This is crazy!

01:40.699 --> 01:42.202
This is amazing.

01:50.908 --> 01:52.377
Where do we begin?

01:52.411 --> 01:54.581
I don't know.
All this stuff looks so steep.

01:57.015 --> 01:58.750
Hey. How about that one?

01:58.783 --> 01:59.851
Nice little warm-up spot?

01:59.884 --> 02:01.220
- Is that?
- Yeah.

02:03.389 --> 02:04.456
Nice.

02:06.892 --> 02:08.228
Come on, girl.

02:11.663 --> 02:12.698
Whoo.

02:15.900 --> 02:17.369
Got you right here.

02:23.775 --> 02:25.177
You're all right.

02:25.777 --> 02:27.579
Here we go.

02:27.613 --> 02:29.181
- Whoo.
- You got this.

02:29.214 --> 02:31.084
You may wanna move
the pad over.

02:31.883 --> 02:33.151
Thanks, I got it.

02:44.996 --> 02:46.164
Oh. Oh.

02:46.198 --> 02:47.933
- You good?
- Yeah.

02:47.966 --> 02:50.169
- Thanks for the spot. Oh.
- You're welcome.

02:50.202 --> 02:51.704
- You all right?
- Yeah.

02:51.737 --> 02:54.874
The idea is to get your
foot to stick to the rock.

02:54.906 --> 02:58.076
- Cute.
- It's our first time coming outside, so...

02:58.109 --> 02:59.411
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:59.444 --> 03:00.680
It's a long way from
the climbing gym.

03:00.712 --> 03:03.181
Oh, wow, yeah. The view's
a lot better, isn't it?

03:03.215 --> 03:04.250
Yeah, when you live in a city,

03:04.282 --> 03:06.151
you gotta make do
with what you got.

03:06.185 --> 03:07.586
No, gyms, I mean,
gyms are great.

03:07.619 --> 03:09.322
They, they get
you strong, but...

03:09.354 --> 03:11.524
now you're outside, you gotta
learn how to climb for real.

03:12.924 --> 03:14.259
Funny.

03:16.995 --> 03:19.599
Well, climb safe, ladies.

03:26.003 --> 03:27.273
Not bad, right?

03:27.305 --> 03:29.074
Yeah. If you like blond girls.

03:29.108 --> 03:30.743
Well, maybe I like blond girls.

03:32.610 --> 03:36.781
- Please. No. Not a chance. Not a chance.
- Hmm? Hmm?

03:41.686 --> 03:42.620
Oh, man.

03:42.654 --> 03:45.124
This is party central.

03:45.156 --> 03:46.691
- Oh, yeah.
- He's got a bigger wingspan.

03:46.725 --> 03:49.161
- He's got like a plus four.
- You gotta check this out.

03:56.869 --> 03:58.804
So, where are
you guys from?

03:58.836 --> 04:01.139
- LA.
- No, really.

04:01.173 --> 04:04.176
Yeah. First time, actually.

04:04.209 --> 04:06.645
Get your beer open.
It's a bottle opener.

04:06.678 --> 04:10.216
- Hey, thanks again for that spot today.
- You're welcome.

04:16.454 --> 04:18.124
- Here we go.
- Who's your friend and who's her friend?

04:18.156 --> 04:21.527
- Hey, Brett. How's it going?
- Hi, Catrina. It's going good. How are you?

04:21.559 --> 04:25.797
- So what did you climb today?
- Uh, today was kind of more of a rest day for me.

04:35.039 --> 04:37.008
Oh, my God.

04:37.042 --> 04:39.979
- Why is he coming towards us?
- Oh, my gosh. I don't know. I don't know what's happening.

04:40.011 --> 04:42.648
- Hi.
- Hello.

04:42.681 --> 04:45.418
Hey, you wouldn't have
a spare avocado, would you?

04:45.450 --> 04:48.052
- No. Sorry.
- Yes, we do.

04:48.085 --> 04:49.422
- Here.
- Thanks.

04:49.455 --> 04:51.390
- You're welcome.
- Hey, we're having a little potluck

04:51.422 --> 04:52.991
over in Site 42 if you

04:53.025 --> 04:54.960
wanna stop by. I could
probably get you on the list.

04:54.992 --> 04:56.528
Where is Site 42?

04:56.561 --> 05:00.098
It's over there.
It's Brett's camp.

05:00.131 --> 05:03.468
- I think we're good.
- Well, no, actually, I think that sounds like a lot of fun.

05:03.501 --> 05:06.338
- And that's why we're good. 'Cause we'll be there.
- Great.

05:06.972 --> 05:08.741
Domo avocado, Mr. Roboto.

05:08.773 --> 05:12.444
What? Brett's the guy we met
at the boulders today, remember?

05:13.244 --> 05:15.146
He's cute.
So is he.

05:15.179 --> 05:17.182
I'm not here to meet guys.

05:17.215 --> 05:19.217
Now, you're the one that said we
needed to try new things, so...

05:19.251 --> 05:23.256
- "Domo avocado, Mr. Roboto." That's not funny.
- That was funny.

05:28.025 --> 05:29.627
- Steve!
- What's up, Brett?

05:29.660 --> 05:32.131
- How are you doing? Good to see you.
- What's up? How are you?

05:32.164 --> 05:34.033
Good to be seen.
What'd you get into today?

05:35.766 --> 05:37.436
It's not so bad.

05:38.402 --> 05:40.605
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey, you made it.

05:40.638 --> 05:42.475
- Yeah, thanks for having us.
- Of course.

05:42.508 --> 05:47.412
- Um, I didn't catch your names earlier. I'm Jeremy.
- Oh, this is Jade and I'm Rose.

05:47.446 --> 05:50.282
Hi, Jade. That's how
we do that. Yeah, hey.

05:50.314 --> 05:53.952
Hey, these two are
camping next to Jackie's site.

05:53.986 --> 05:57.056
Jackie Blackstone.
She's like a climber legend.

05:57.088 --> 05:59.057
Big wall first ascents
in the valley.

05:59.090 --> 06:00.792
- The Yosemite Valley?
- Yeah.

06:00.825 --> 06:04.263
- First woman to solo the nodes.
- Good Lord. You mean without any ropes?

06:04.296 --> 06:07.366
No, not free solo.
Solo climb with gear.

06:07.398 --> 06:09.768
- So, she slept on the wall?
- Yeah.

06:09.801 --> 06:12.604
You should try it
sometime. It's amazing.

06:12.638 --> 06:15.474
Huh? What do you think?
What do you think, Jade?

06:15.506 --> 06:17.309
- Something to drink?
- Yes, please.

06:17.342 --> 06:19.946
How about some drinks, huh?
Beers? ROSE: Yes, please. Thank you.

06:22.313 --> 06:23.581
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:23.614 --> 06:25.684
Uh, we met earlier
today at the boulders.

06:25.717 --> 06:28.419
Yeah, I remember.
I'm Rose, by the way.

06:28.453 --> 06:30.388
- Brett.
- It's nice to meet you, Brett.

06:30.422 --> 06:31.624
Nice to meet you, Rose.

06:33.124 --> 06:35.226
I'll be right back.

06:35.260 --> 06:36.328
Okay.

06:36.361 --> 06:38.464
- Hey.
- Thank you.

06:38.496 --> 06:40.398
- To the good life.
- To the good life.

06:40.431 --> 06:42.902
To the good life.

06:55.547 --> 06:57.249
- Oh, Jesus.
- Sorry.

06:57.282 --> 06:58.784
Oh, my God.

06:58.816 --> 07:00.652
- Hi.
- Do you wanna come inside?

07:00.686 --> 07:03.089
- Is it your place?
- Yeah.

07:04.155 --> 07:05.456
"House of Dreams," huh?

07:05.489 --> 07:07.359
- Very good. Let me get the light.
- Thank you.

07:09.094 --> 07:10.363
Watch your step.

07:15.167 --> 07:16.936
- This is so cute.
- Yeah.

07:18.003 --> 07:19.972
Not too shabby.

07:20.972 --> 07:22.273
Welcome.

07:22.306 --> 07:23.508
Oh, my God. Is this you?

07:23.542 --> 07:26.477
Uh, no. It's one
of my favorite photos.

07:26.511 --> 07:28.380
But did you see
what I mean about

07:28.412 --> 07:29.514
gym climbing, right?

07:29.547 --> 07:31.649
It's just practice
for this big rock.

07:31.683 --> 07:35.555
Yeah, but this is just
something I don't understand.

07:36.287 --> 07:37.922
I don't know,
it's like...

07:37.955 --> 07:39.958
It's like you have
a death wish or something.

07:39.991 --> 07:44.629
Oh, um, climbers actually have a life wish.
If we wanted to die, we'd just let go.

07:45.429 --> 07:48.167
Well, okay,
I get that, but...

07:48.200 --> 07:51.137
Why put yourself in that
kind of danger to begin with?

07:51.770 --> 07:53.172
For the bliss.

07:53.205 --> 07:55.174
You know, when you're up there,
nothing else can come in your mind.

07:55.207 --> 07:57.676
It's total focus.
More real than real.

07:57.708 --> 07:59.444
- "More real than real"?
- More real than real.

08:00.378 --> 08:01.813
Can you explain that

08:01.847 --> 08:03.349
a little bit better
for me, please?

08:03.381 --> 08:06.551
Um, when you're on

08:07.251 --> 08:09.054
a 1,000-foot face,

08:09.087 --> 08:11.789
there is nothing like it in
the world. It's total freedom.

08:11.823 --> 08:15.426
Yeah. Freedom to plummet
straight on down to your death.

08:15.460 --> 08:18.164
Okay. I see we got
some work to do.

08:20.398 --> 08:22.834
- Close your eyes. Close 'em.
- Why?

08:24.001 --> 08:25.203
Trust me.

08:26.438 --> 08:27.840
Okay.

08:29.073 --> 08:30.175
Take a deep breath.

08:34.745 --> 08:36.881
Now, imagine you're
on that 1,000-foot cliff.

08:38.149 --> 08:42.020
Look around you.
You see ravens soaring below you.

08:42.053 --> 08:44.121
You're clinging to the rock
like a lizard.

08:46.557 --> 08:48.126
You feel the quiet
of the desert.

08:49.561 --> 08:52.565
Rising, filling you up.
Making you feel lighter.

08:57.768 --> 09:00.239
You're aware
of every muscle...

09:02.074 --> 09:03.542
every nerve...

09:04.442 --> 09:05.977
tendon, bone in your body.

09:09.480 --> 09:10.915
And in your spirit...

09:15.287 --> 09:16.656
it makes you feel
like you're flying.

09:27.032 --> 09:28.768
- I'm sorry. I...
- Um...

09:29.869 --> 09:32.838
- Got carried away.
- Yeah. Me too.

09:34.071 --> 09:35.974
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

09:36.007 --> 09:39.178
Tell me what's happening
over here. This looks intense.

09:40.277 --> 09:42.214
That's an alpine route.

09:42.247 --> 09:44.516
- An alpine route?
- Yeah.

09:44.548 --> 09:46.619
Well, I think I might
wanna try an alpine route.

09:47.753 --> 09:50.089
You've come to the right place.
Wanna climb tomorrow?

09:51.056 --> 09:52.224
Yeah. I wanna fly.

09:57.394 --> 09:58.663
'Sup, girl?

10:00.197 --> 10:01.199
Let's go.

10:03.134 --> 10:05.069
Well, see you <i>manana.</i>

10:06.271 --> 10:09.041
Jade. Hey.

10:09.074 --> 10:11.811
Hey, don't forget we're gonna
go bouldering tomorrow, so...

10:12.409 --> 10:13.511
Yeah.

10:13.545 --> 10:14.613
Yeah. Great.

10:14.646 --> 10:16.982
- Maybe. Maybe...
- Maybe not.

10:17.014 --> 10:19.784
Uh, someone made a friend today.

10:19.817 --> 10:21.652
I can't believe you
ditched me like that.

10:21.686 --> 10:23.888
Oh, come on. We are
not in high school anymore.

10:23.922 --> 10:26.225
- I like these people.
- Rock brats?

10:26.258 --> 10:27.560
Well, maybe
I like rock brats.

11:02.460 --> 11:03.628
Hi!

11:03.662 --> 11:04.963
You coming in?

11:04.995 --> 11:07.699
I'm sorry. I was
just looking around.

11:08.667 --> 11:10.235
At nature.

11:11.702 --> 11:13.571
You want some coffee?

11:13.604 --> 11:15.740
I'm good.
Thank you, though. Um...

11:16.740 --> 11:18.276
Actually, that
sounds really nice.

11:19.543 --> 11:20.745
All right.

11:23.681 --> 11:25.817
- Coffee.
- Mmm.

11:25.850 --> 11:27.219
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

11:33.992 --> 11:36.395
- Hey, that's pretty good.
- It's my secret recipe.

11:37.095 --> 11:38.629
What's the secret?

11:38.662 --> 11:40.765
Uh, I couldn't tell you that. I'd have
to kill you if I did, it's classified.

11:40.798 --> 11:45.102
Well, you see, actually, I have level 10
security clearance, so I sort of outrank you.

11:45.135 --> 11:47.705
Madame X, I should
have known, sorry.

11:48.340 --> 11:49.273
Uh, it's sage.

11:49.306 --> 11:50.942
Sage? Like sage brush?

11:50.975 --> 11:52.710
Yeah, it's growing
all around the campsite.

11:52.744 --> 11:54.046
You put sage brush
in your coffee?

11:54.079 --> 11:56.080
Well, it's a herb.
A sacred herb.

11:56.114 --> 11:57.548
I use it for a lot of things.

11:57.581 --> 11:59.250
- Like what?
- I'll show you.

12:02.019 --> 12:04.922
See, smells good.
Apply generously.

12:04.955 --> 12:07.692
Oh, come on. Is that what
I'm drinking right now?

12:07.725 --> 12:10.895
No, obviously not sage
that was in my armpits.

12:10.928 --> 12:16.000
Um, I cook with it. A lot. And it's, if you're
in a pinch, it's really good for wiping your...

12:16.033 --> 12:18.135
Oh, God, Brett.
Seriously? Come on.

12:18.168 --> 12:21.072
I'm done. I'm done with the personal
hygiene classes. Please, thank you.

12:21.105 --> 12:22.474
Done with class.

12:22.507 --> 12:24.075
I thought we were
going climbing anyway.

12:24.109 --> 12:27.412
Yes. Um, I'll come back
and pick you up in five minutes.

12:27.445 --> 12:28.714
Okay.

12:32.883 --> 12:33.952
Hey.

12:38.056 --> 12:43.427
- Where are you going?
- Morning. Going climbing with Brett.

12:43.460 --> 12:47.765
- You're ditching me again?
- No. He's just taking me on a route.

12:48.465 --> 12:49.868
A what?

12:49.901 --> 12:53.104
A route, like
a multi-pitch climb.

12:53.138 --> 12:57.508
Ugh. Don't leave me with
that Jeremy guy again, please.

12:57.542 --> 12:59.777
You're gonna be fine, darling.

12:59.811 --> 13:01.280
Besides, I really
wanna try this, okay?

13:09.620 --> 13:11.622
- Morning, Jeremy.
- Hi. Have fun.

13:11.656 --> 13:12.958
I will.

13:21.432 --> 13:22.500
Still wanna go bouldering?

13:25.637 --> 13:28.306
- You got beer?
- We always have beer.

14:39.676 --> 14:42.047
- You ever used a GRIGRI?
- Um, sorry.

14:42.080 --> 14:44.816
- It's easy. I'm on top.
- Okay.

14:44.849 --> 14:46.852
Just like any other device.

14:46.884 --> 14:49.420
Brake hands on the bottom.
If I fall, you catch me.

14:49.454 --> 14:51.690
- Simple.
- Wait, no, no. But how do I do that?

14:51.723 --> 14:53.325
It's auto-locking,
so just lean back.

14:53.858 --> 14:56.161
Okay. Good luck.

16:00.657 --> 16:01.893
Okay, you're on belay.

16:03.695 --> 16:05.431
- Okay. Climbing.
- Climb on.

16:07.231 --> 16:08.266
Nice, Rose.

16:12.670 --> 16:13.672
Ah.

16:22.379 --> 16:24.148
Come on, Rose.
Don't stop now.

16:25.149 --> 16:27.251
- My foot is stuck, Brett.
- Just pull it out.

16:27.585 --> 16:28.820
What...

16:28.853 --> 16:31.290
- What do you think I'm trying to do?
- Yank it straight back.

16:32.422 --> 16:34.792
Ah, you got it.
Nice. Keep coming.

16:34.825 --> 16:36.095
Ah.

16:37.162 --> 16:38.596
My hand feels like it's
gonna slip.

16:39.397 --> 16:41.333
Chalk it up.

16:41.365 --> 16:44.401
It's kind of wedged
in a wall right now.

16:44.435 --> 16:46.405
Crank it in there
and then step up.

16:47.238 --> 16:48.340
Okay.

16:54.512 --> 16:57.416
Nice. Really nice.

16:59.850 --> 17:02.386
This does not feel good.

17:07.858 --> 17:09.160
Nice.

17:14.365 --> 17:15.333
Let me take it.

17:15.366 --> 17:17.035
- Thank you.
- Give you a break.

17:18.002 --> 17:19.538
Yeah. Oh.

17:19.570 --> 17:22.071
Your hands, you're starting to
look like a real crack climber.

17:22.106 --> 17:24.009
- Everything hurts.
- Yeah.

17:26.010 --> 17:27.412
How high are we?

17:27.444 --> 17:28.512
Oh, about 300 feet.

17:29.680 --> 17:31.782
- This is crazy.
- Definitely.

17:31.815 --> 17:33.417
- You're crazy
- Now, you're up.

17:33.885 --> 17:34.920
What do you mean?

17:34.953 --> 17:37.388
- It's your turn.
- For what?

17:37.421 --> 17:38.556
To take the lead.

17:38.590 --> 17:40.859
- You want me to lead?
- Ha, ha. You'll love it. It's a...

17:40.891 --> 17:43.661
Five 8 bolts. You know,
try the shortcut.

17:43.695 --> 17:44.996
It's totally within your score.

17:45.030 --> 17:48.233
- I have never led outside before.
- But, oh, you gotta try it.

17:48.265 --> 17:50.201
- No.
- You'll love it. Try it.

17:50.234 --> 17:51.602
- Why are you telling me?
- Come on.

17:51.636 --> 17:53.705
- Be adventurous. Okay? All right.
- Okay, okay, okay.

17:53.737 --> 17:55.706
Why do I let you convince
me to do these things?

17:55.740 --> 17:57.742
Well, what do I do?

17:57.774 --> 18:01.045
Just climb up left, and all the way at the top
of the pitch, there's anchors. Just clip in.

18:01.079 --> 18:03.048
- All right. You got me?
- I got you.

18:07.318 --> 18:08.320
Nice.

18:09.253 --> 18:11.089
Easy. Look at that.

18:15.926 --> 18:17.094
Nice.

18:22.899 --> 18:24.969
Nice.

18:25.003 --> 18:26.605
- Yeah.
- I don't like it.

18:26.638 --> 18:28.573
Clip that and you're as
safe as you can be.

18:32.843 --> 18:35.580
- Nice, Rose. Whoa.
- All right.

18:37.282 --> 18:40.319
- There's nothing up here, Brett.
- Just stay on the arete.

18:49.159 --> 18:50.428
You got it.

19:00.338 --> 19:02.072
I don't...
I don't like it, Brett.

19:02.106 --> 19:03.708
- What?
- Can I come down?

19:03.741 --> 19:05.577
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

19:05.609 --> 19:07.411
- Let me know when. I'm on it.
- Okay, yeah.

19:07.445 --> 19:09.281
- All right, lowering.
- Okay.

19:10.281 --> 19:12.818
Oh, God. Oh.

19:25.897 --> 19:27.532
God, that sucks.

19:30.033 --> 19:33.170
It's not like a bouldering problem.
You can't just jump down from 300 feet.

19:34.705 --> 19:37.408
- God, everything changes when the rope is below you.
- True.

19:42.746 --> 19:43.881
There you go.

20:30.227 --> 20:31.495
All right,
you're on belay.

20:33.063 --> 20:34.265
Tension.

20:36.900 --> 20:39.236
Slap me in
the fucking face.

20:56.686 --> 20:59.424
Oh. Oh, shit.

21:02.126 --> 21:03.395
Oh.

21:11.234 --> 21:12.536
Nice.

21:14.539 --> 21:16.407
Up rope.

21:16.440 --> 21:18.609
There's a good hold right above...
Yeah, right there.

21:21.244 --> 21:25.315
- Yeah. It holds all the way.
- Jesus.

21:25.349 --> 21:27.585
- Yeah.
- Would you pay attention, Brett, please?

21:27.618 --> 21:30.554
That tension, you kept
slapping me in the face.

21:30.588 --> 21:33.425
Well, one minute, you want tension
and next minute, you want slack.

21:33.457 --> 21:36.194
- I need you to keep it tight.
- I was keeping it tight.

21:36.226 --> 21:37.762
- What if I fell?
- I would have caught you.

21:37.794 --> 21:40.398
- When? When I hit the fucking ground?
- Your anchor.

21:40.430 --> 21:43.000
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Me, ridiculous?

21:43.033 --> 21:45.102
Are you kidding me right now?
You're the ridiculous one.

21:45.136 --> 21:47.004
- Oh, yeah?
- Seriously.

21:47.038 --> 21:48.540
What the fuck
is going on here?

21:48.572 --> 21:50.841
- And you're just standing there.
- Yeah, I'm just standing here.

21:50.875 --> 21:53.478
Yeah, just standing there,
hanging off a cliff, looking at me

21:53.511 --> 21:55.680
with that stupid smirk
on your face, that's...

22:06.657 --> 22:07.591
Shit...

22:07.625 --> 22:10.561
- Oh, my God. Don't do that.
- I got you.

22:11.228 --> 22:12.898
Come here and sit.

22:23.707 --> 22:25.342
- Are you kidding me?
- All in the rope.

22:26.878 --> 22:28.580
You're a real climber now.

22:31.415 --> 22:32.684
I love it up here!

22:36.052 --> 22:37.289
How do we get down?

23:19.664 --> 23:20.732
Oh!

23:46.389 --> 23:48.627
That's so great.
Good job.

23:49.493 --> 23:52.030
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Grab my bag?

23:53.397 --> 23:54.499
You got it?

23:55.800 --> 23:57.132
Thank you.

23:57.134 --> 23:59.804
- There you go.
- There are gentlemen left in the world.

24:02.372 --> 24:03.475
Thank you.

24:06.843 --> 24:07.811
Oh, ouch.

24:07.844 --> 24:09.947
- You want some water?
- Yes, that'd be great.

24:14.551 --> 24:16.388
Would you listen to these names?

24:16.920 --> 24:18.855
Crack of Doom,

24:18.888 --> 24:21.758
Cliffs of Insanity,
Wet Denim Daydream,

24:21.792 --> 24:24.428
Stoner's Highway.
Of course.

24:24.462 --> 24:26.431
Who in the world comes up
with these names?

24:26.464 --> 24:29.100
The first person
that ascends it

24:29.132 --> 24:32.469
gets to name it. Climbers
are very melodramatic.

24:32.503 --> 24:35.072
Uh-huh. You don't say.

24:35.106 --> 24:39.044
Oh, this is it. This is what I wanna do tomorrow.
Killer Pillar. I was thinking about it.

24:42.045 --> 24:43.447
What?

24:43.481 --> 24:45.450
I'm not afraid. Come on.
You're my rope gun.

24:45.483 --> 24:47.018
Look, Killer Pillar,
it's the real deal.

24:47.051 --> 24:49.320
It's not just a couple pitches.
It's a commitment.

24:49.352 --> 24:51.855
- It's a Grade V.
- Okay, well...

24:51.888 --> 24:53.491
I did good out there today.
You said so yourself.

24:53.523 --> 24:56.761
You were doing great, but this is
a whole other level of shredding.

24:56.793 --> 24:59.830
Oh, it's a whole
other level of shredding.

24:59.863 --> 25:03.600
God, I love these technical
rock-climbing terms.

25:03.634 --> 25:06.204
Hey, look. If you don't wanna
go, then just say something,

25:06.236 --> 25:08.538
- and I'll find somebody else to climb with.
- Wow.

25:08.571 --> 25:11.075
- Ouch. You fight dirty.
- Whatever it takes.

25:11.775 --> 25:14.978
- Please?
- All right. If...

25:15.012 --> 25:17.715
If I were to say yes,
and that's a big if,

25:17.747 --> 25:19.516
you would have to be ready
for some serious suffering.

25:19.550 --> 25:21.351
And I, I really wanna
make that clear.

25:21.385 --> 25:24.055
I mean, I think I can handle it 'cause I
have been hanging out with you all day.

25:24.821 --> 25:27.358
Oh! Stop!

25:27.390 --> 25:28.725
What are you gonna do
with that water?

25:28.759 --> 25:30.495
I'm thirsty.
I was gonna have some water.

25:30.528 --> 25:32.731
Oh. Don't!

25:33.296 --> 25:34.965
Don't do that. Stop!

25:35.265 --> 25:36.967
Don't!

25:38.468 --> 25:40.604
- "Don't drink some more water."
- No!

25:42.039 --> 25:44.542
No! Stop!

25:45.109 --> 25:46.409
- Hey.
- Hello.

25:46.443 --> 25:48.746
- Still making barbecue?
- Uh, no, not yet. But I'll get on it.

25:48.779 --> 25:53.284
- Do you wanna come have some food with us tonight?
- Yeah, sure. I'll make a salad.

25:53.317 --> 25:55.119
Great, bring a salad.

25:55.151 --> 25:56.453
- Bring your friend Jade.
- Oh.

25:56.486 --> 25:59.056
- Oh, I'll do it.
- I mean, it doesn't... I didn't.

25:59.557 --> 26:00.792
- Whatever.
- Okay.

26:07.263 --> 26:10.033
Hey. You're,
you're Jackie, right?

26:10.067 --> 26:13.471
- And you are?
- I'm Rose, I'm your neighbor.

26:13.503 --> 26:16.107
- Do you mind if I ask a question?
- Go ahead.

26:18.074 --> 26:19.143
How do you do it?

26:19.843 --> 26:21.478
Do what?

26:21.512 --> 26:24.282
Sorry, um, how
do you lead climb?

26:24.314 --> 26:26.917
Just practice.
That's all it takes.

26:26.951 --> 26:28.687
Yeah, but,
I mean, can you...

26:29.453 --> 26:30.622
Can you tell me about it?

26:32.388 --> 26:34.992
You just gotta
get out of your head.

26:35.024 --> 26:36.794
Well, that's not the
first time I've heard that.

26:37.828 --> 26:40.764
When you're climbing,
especially leading,

26:41.698 --> 26:44.435
you have to
trust your body.

26:44.467 --> 26:46.603
It's a lot more
reliable than your mind.

26:46.637 --> 26:50.041
And if you can start trusting,
that's when you can

26:50.741 --> 26:52.277
step into your real power.

26:53.042 --> 26:54.878
Easier said than done.

26:54.911 --> 26:57.614
- Right?
- Let's try something.

26:58.448 --> 27:00.784
- Hold out your arm.
- Okay.

27:00.818 --> 27:02.887
- I'm gonna ask you some questions.
- Okay.

27:02.919 --> 27:04.589
But don't answer
out loud, okay?

27:05.555 --> 27:07.057
Are you in Lone Pine?

27:09.526 --> 27:10.794
Do you like climbing?

27:12.463 --> 27:13.697
Are you a happy person?

27:14.764 --> 27:17.132
- Mmm.
- What does that mean?

27:17.134 --> 27:21.673
That means that your body knows you a
whole lot better than you think you do.

27:23.107 --> 27:25.609
It'll make a lot more sense
once you've been out there.

27:28.044 --> 27:29.613
So, where are you
climbing tomorrow?

27:29.647 --> 27:32.649
I think we're going to do Killer Pillar.
I wanna get on that route.

27:32.683 --> 27:38.256
- I think it's called Southwest Buttress?
- That's a really sporty route.

27:38.289 --> 27:41.392
- Who're you climbing that with?
- Oh, my friend, Brett.

27:41.425 --> 27:44.395
- Just a guy.
- Is he familiar with long routes like that?

27:44.427 --> 27:47.864
Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean, he says
he knows what he's doing, so...

27:47.898 --> 27:49.934
- Don't they all?
- Yeah.

27:54.905 --> 27:57.041
- He's amazing, actually.
- Yeah?

27:57.073 --> 27:58.441
Really?

27:58.475 --> 28:00.011
I had a lot of fun, actually.

28:00.711 --> 28:02.046
Whatever I can
do for you.

28:02.745 --> 28:05.649
- Hey, hi.
- Hey.

28:05.683 --> 28:07.752
Thanks for coming.
You brought lettuce.

28:07.784 --> 28:10.154
- You'll want it later. Trust me.
- Okay. Great. Thanks.

28:11.655 --> 28:13.324
- How's it going?
- It's going.

28:13.357 --> 28:15.893
- You had fun today?
- I had a really good time today.

28:15.926 --> 28:19.797
- Good.
- It's like, everyone comes from everywhere.

28:19.830 --> 28:24.202
All over the world. Lone Pine is a
central hub for the climbing community.

28:25.636 --> 28:27.071
And they all just come
here to hang out?

28:27.571 --> 28:28.907
Hang out and climb.

28:30.506 --> 28:32.142
Doesn't anybody work?

28:32.176 --> 28:33.177
Why?

28:34.578 --> 28:37.381
- I mean, right?
- Sorry, yeah, yeah. It does make sense.

28:37.414 --> 28:40.283
Ladies and gentlemen, Jackie
Blackstone is in the house.

28:40.317 --> 28:43.654
Jackie Blackstone is here. Are you seeing this?

28:43.686 --> 28:45.822
Jackie Blackstone is here.
Give it up.

28:45.856 --> 28:48.225
- Whoo.
- First ascent in the Valley.

28:49.827 --> 28:51.863
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, God. It's happening.

28:51.896 --> 28:54.632
- It's happening!
- It's going down.

28:54.665 --> 28:57.501
<i>♪ I flow 5.10
in a moment of Zen</i>

28:57.533 --> 29:00.737
<i>♪ Been pulling down
the rocks since way back when</i>

29:00.771 --> 29:03.640
<i>♪ When you say Muddy Valley

29:03.674 --> 29:06.377
<i>♪ With your royal robins</i>

<i>♪ Point-5 aliens

29:21.225 --> 29:22.726
Oh!

29:22.760 --> 29:25.263
Yeah! He did it!

29:27.430 --> 29:29.232
- What?
- What happened?

29:29.265 --> 29:30.500
What happened?

29:31.968 --> 29:33.737
- Very pretty.
- Thank you, Jackie.

29:34.437 --> 29:36.273
It's for you. It's for you.

29:39.409 --> 29:40.811
- What?
- Hmm.

29:41.311 --> 29:42.213
What?

29:43.981 --> 29:45.282
Amazing night there.

29:46.382 --> 29:47.484
I don't know.

29:48.284 --> 29:49.619
It doesn't even look real.

29:49.653 --> 29:51.489
What do you mean?

29:51.522 --> 29:52.956
Looks like the planetarium.

29:55.225 --> 29:57.494
You definitely need
to get outside more.

29:58.329 --> 29:59.297
Maybe.

30:00.597 --> 30:01.933
Mmm, check it out.
It's starlight.

30:01.965 --> 30:04.668
It's where we all come from.

30:04.702 --> 30:06.537
It's everything.

30:06.570 --> 30:07.772
We're all just...

30:08.705 --> 30:09.940
stardust.

30:12.208 --> 30:13.476
Hmm.

30:13.510 --> 30:15.479
Well, when I was a kid,

30:15.512 --> 30:17.080
my dad loved
to point out the fact

30:17.113 --> 30:18.949
that by the time the light
from one of those stars

30:18.983 --> 30:20.217
reached us on Earth,

30:21.417 --> 30:22.786
the star was already dead.

30:24.655 --> 30:26.324
He told you that as a kid?

30:27.523 --> 30:28.493
Yeah.

30:29.626 --> 30:31.195
That's when he was
in a good mood.

30:39.069 --> 30:40.938
How do you feel right now?

30:43.540 --> 30:45.276
- Right now?
- Mmm-hmm.

30:46.510 --> 30:47.512
I don't know.

30:50.446 --> 30:52.316
Kind of nice.

31:05.161 --> 31:06.629
- Ouch, ouch.
- Okay, here.

31:06.663 --> 31:07.565
Yeah. Slow.

31:08.631 --> 31:10.266
Wasn't that nice?

31:10.300 --> 31:11.702
- Hey, Brett.
- Hi!

31:11.734 --> 31:14.338
What'd you climb today,
Pine Creek?

31:14.370 --> 31:15.505
Yes, that's...

31:15.539 --> 31:17.141
- That's what we climbed today.
- What we climbed, yeah.

31:17.174 --> 31:20.444
Hey, Lee, how do you like being
Brett's new belay slave?

31:20.476 --> 31:21.744
- Wow.
- Jesus.

31:21.779 --> 31:23.547
Hey, Catrina. I think somebody's
looking for you over here.

31:23.580 --> 31:24.581
Well, let me guess.

31:24.615 --> 31:27.251
You climbed
Crack-a-Go-Go, right?

31:27.283 --> 31:30.187
Yeah, I bet you really
liked that third pitch.

31:32.356 --> 31:33.590
Yeah.

31:33.623 --> 31:34.758
Yeah, it was fine.

31:34.792 --> 31:36.726
I bet it was.

31:36.760 --> 31:39.629
- Jeremy, can you get her out of here, please?
- Yeah. Sorry, man.

31:39.663 --> 31:41.832
Hey, I thought
we talked about this.

31:41.865 --> 31:44.001
Huh? Come on,
are you about done?

31:44.033 --> 31:46.003
Okay. Are these all yours?

31:46.035 --> 31:48.605
Hey. Hey, where are you going?

31:48.638 --> 31:50.273
I'm tired.
Long climb tomorrow.

31:50.307 --> 31:51.909
Oh, Catrina. She drinks
and she can't stop...

31:51.942 --> 31:53.277
Come on, Brett.
Just don't do that.

31:53.310 --> 31:55.446
Don't treat me like I'm an
idiot, because I get it.

31:55.478 --> 31:57.715
Get what? That I've climbed
with a woman before?

31:57.747 --> 31:58.948
Oh, God. Forget it.

31:58.982 --> 32:00.484
At least now I know my job.

32:00.516 --> 32:01.417
Belay slave.

32:01.452 --> 32:03.487
Oh, come on, Rose.
You're being ridiculous.

32:03.520 --> 32:04.621
- Rose.
- I'm being...

32:04.655 --> 32:06.824
Brett, this is just happening
too fast for me, okay?

32:06.857 --> 32:07.792
What is?

32:07.824 --> 32:09.793
- Everything! All of this.
- What?

32:09.827 --> 32:11.228
I am not used to camping

32:11.261 --> 32:13.230
or to looking up
at all of these stars

32:13.263 --> 32:16.199
or being dragged up
an 800-foot cliff.

32:16.832 --> 32:17.734
And I'm certainly not used

32:17.767 --> 32:19.202
to the way you keep
looking at me.

32:19.235 --> 32:20.303
How do I keep looking?

32:20.337 --> 32:21.973
- I don't know, Brett. I don't know.
- Tell me.

32:24.574 --> 32:25.542
Like you care.

32:31.380 --> 32:32.417
I do care.

32:35.284 --> 32:38.523
Could you please not say that
if you don't mean it?

32:42.725 --> 32:44.061
I mean it.

32:51.033 --> 32:52.302
I'm going to bed.

33:58.801 --> 33:59.837
Rose, you awake?

33:59.869 --> 34:02.071
Mmm. No.

34:02.105 --> 34:04.742
Do you still
wanna go climb?

34:05.809 --> 34:07.378
- Yes.
- Okay.

34:07.410 --> 34:10.181
Well, I got all the gear
ready in the car, so...

34:10.913 --> 34:12.248
You just need to get up.

34:12.616 --> 34:13.717
I'm up.

34:13.750 --> 34:15.186
I'm awake.

34:16.752 --> 34:18.888
It's barely
even light outside.

34:18.922 --> 34:20.257
It's gonna be in 45 minutes.

34:20.290 --> 34:21.824
And it's in an hour approach
to the Pillar.

34:21.857 --> 34:23.060
What?

34:24.493 --> 34:25.561
Ah!

34:25.594 --> 34:27.598
- You good from here, or...
- Yeah, I'm good.

34:27.630 --> 34:28.831
- Boom.
- Dang.

34:28.864 --> 34:29.831
Door-to-door.

34:29.866 --> 34:31.268
- What's going on there?
- Oh.

34:31.301 --> 34:32.703
- Brett.
- Hey, what's up?

34:32.735 --> 34:33.871
- Jade.
- What's up?

34:33.904 --> 34:35.239
Hey.

34:35.272 --> 34:36.739
- 5:00 a.m. We're going climbing.
- We just got done drinking.

34:36.772 --> 34:38.074
You just got done drinking?

34:38.107 --> 34:39.943
- All night long.
- We ran out of beers, so...

34:39.976 --> 34:41.145
So then the game's over.

34:41.177 --> 34:42.313
Well, we... We won.

34:43.447 --> 34:44.382
I'm going to bed.

34:45.114 --> 34:46.216
Are you guys not still drunk?

34:46.250 --> 34:47.818
- Good night, Jade.
- Good night.

34:47.851 --> 34:49.018
Okay, have fun.

34:49.052 --> 34:50.821
- Oh.
- Be well.

34:50.853 --> 34:52.223
Oh!

34:52.255 --> 34:54.090
Oh, Dad, I'm doing it.

36:06.330 --> 36:08.366
That's what a thousand feet
looks like.

36:09.799 --> 36:12.068
You ready for this?

36:12.101 --> 36:13.936
Um, how many pitches
is it again?

36:13.969 --> 36:15.138
A lot.

36:15.172 --> 36:16.540
Descriptive, thank you.

36:19.076 --> 36:20.311
And it says

36:20.344 --> 36:22.679
the route starts
left of the trees.

36:22.712 --> 36:23.747
So that's right here.

36:24.581 --> 36:25.816
What is this?

36:25.848 --> 36:29.018
Uh, it's a topo.
It's like a map of the climb.

36:29.052 --> 36:30.154
So there's no actual guidebook?

36:30.186 --> 36:31.487
No, I have one,

36:31.520 --> 36:33.523
but a topo is way easier
to carry than a whole book.

36:33.556 --> 36:36.127
What the hell does
any of this even mean?

36:36.960 --> 36:39.862
Well, that is a crack climb,

36:39.895 --> 36:42.131
and this is
a left-facing corner.

36:42.165 --> 36:45.134
Um, that's a chimney, bolts.

36:45.168 --> 36:46.370
You don't know
what any of that means?

36:46.402 --> 36:47.937
- Sounds amazing.
- Okay.

36:47.971 --> 36:49.239
- Here you go, sir.
- Thank you.

36:49.272 --> 36:50.474
You have the harnesses, right?

36:50.507 --> 36:51.875
Oh. Yes, I do.

36:51.907 --> 36:52.877
Oh, good.

37:06.857 --> 37:08.125
- Ready?
- Yep.

37:08.157 --> 37:09.393
Watch me.

37:09.426 --> 37:10.328
Mmm-hmm.

37:10.860 --> 37:12.362
I'm climbing.

37:12.395 --> 37:13.697
Climb along, baby.

38:20.931 --> 38:22.833
- Is that you?
- That's me.

38:22.866 --> 38:23.768
Okay.

38:26.703 --> 38:28.272
All right,
you're on belay, Rose.

38:28.971 --> 38:29.939
I'm climbing.

38:29.973 --> 38:30.875
Climb on.

38:44.253 --> 38:45.556
Rose, reach left there.

38:45.589 --> 38:48.359
There's really good holds
above you, bombers.

38:49.125 --> 38:50.226
I can't reach it.

38:50.259 --> 38:51.928
Yes, you can.

38:51.962 --> 38:53.996
Draw your foot up to that lip,

38:54.029 --> 38:55.532
and then crank up.

38:58.400 --> 39:00.837
Right next to your left foot,
there's another great...

39:00.871 --> 39:02.039
Just let me climb?

39:16.719 --> 39:17.721
You all right?

39:18.855 --> 39:19.790
Yeah.

39:49.920 --> 39:52.523
Jesus.

39:53.255 --> 39:54.590
Oh.

39:54.623 --> 39:57.460
Okay. That's harder
than it looks.

39:58.761 --> 40:00.630
Phew.

40:00.663 --> 40:02.398
Oh, what, so you're
not talking to me now?

40:04.900 --> 40:07.803
This is my punishment
for disobeying you?

40:07.837 --> 40:09.406
Look, Brett,
I appreciate the help. I do.

40:09.438 --> 40:11.141
But how can I learn if you're
feeding me every move?

40:11.174 --> 40:13.310
- You were floundering.
- I was what?

40:13.342 --> 40:14.744
You were having a hard time.

40:14.777 --> 40:15.779
I was not.

40:15.811 --> 40:17.080
This is a hard rock.
I'm still learning.

40:17.112 --> 40:18.881
Exactly. That's why
I pointed out a hold to you.

40:18.915 --> 40:21.717
Okay, well, sometimes I need
to figure it out for myself.

40:21.750 --> 40:24.654
Yeah, and you did, all right?

40:24.688 --> 40:26.690
You're doing good, Rose.
Just...

40:26.723 --> 40:29.025
Thank you.
Was that so hard?

40:29.058 --> 40:30.793
Are we cool now?

40:30.826 --> 40:31.728
Yes.

40:32.295 --> 40:33.497
What's next?

40:33.529 --> 40:34.598
We're going up there next,

40:34.630 --> 40:36.433
and that is called a chimney.

40:36.465 --> 40:37.567
And it's fun.

40:37.601 --> 40:39.403
How do you climb it?

40:39.435 --> 40:42.372
It's kind of like making
your body into a human wedgie.

40:43.572 --> 40:44.641
Well, that sounds awkward.

40:44.674 --> 40:45.976
You're pretty when you smile.

40:46.009 --> 40:46.909
Nah.

40:46.944 --> 40:48.445
That's a good word
for it, though. Awkward.

40:49.279 --> 40:50.581
All right. On belay.

40:51.348 --> 40:52.815
- Put me on.
- Okay.

41:59.315 --> 42:00.517
Nice.

42:24.206 --> 42:25.942
- Come on.
- Climbing.

42:25.975 --> 42:27.777
Come on. Hold that.

42:33.882 --> 42:35.585
Nice work.

42:42.525 --> 42:43.427
Reach up, yeah.

42:43.460 --> 42:45.696
Find a good grab, good crack.

42:45.728 --> 42:46.996
All right. Can you go higher?

42:48.063 --> 42:49.032
Does it look like it?

42:51.601 --> 42:53.570
How am I supposed to get
in a chimney with this thing?

42:54.571 --> 42:55.572
Use your back.

42:55.605 --> 42:57.074
Press your hands
against the wall.

42:57.107 --> 42:58.175
Oh, my God. Okay.

42:58.208 --> 42:59.877
Don't look down. Come on.

43:03.545 --> 43:05.748
Yeah. Push against the wall,

43:05.781 --> 43:08.350
smashing your back
in the other wall,

43:08.384 --> 43:09.853
and just up, up.

43:12.788 --> 43:14.590
There you go.
How's that left hand feel?

43:15.792 --> 43:16.993
Not good.

43:17.025 --> 43:17.927
Look for a little cracks

43:17.960 --> 43:19.830
with the inside
of your right foot.

43:21.598 --> 43:23.100
Stand up on your right foot.

43:23.132 --> 43:24.734
Keep smearing.

43:24.768 --> 43:26.503
I can't climb
with this backpack.

43:26.536 --> 43:28.304
Yes, you can.
You're doing it right now.

43:28.337 --> 43:29.572
Keep climbing.

43:30.773 --> 43:32.509
Good. Wedge your body
in the chimney.

43:32.542 --> 43:34.777
Use opposing force
with your hands.

43:34.810 --> 43:37.046
Press your back up
against it. Good.

43:41.985 --> 43:42.986
Top rope.

43:43.786 --> 43:44.788
Argh.

43:49.558 --> 43:51.560
Whoa. Okay.

43:51.594 --> 43:53.496
Okay, okay.
Is there room up here?

43:53.529 --> 43:54.630
- Yeah.
- Phew.

43:54.663 --> 43:57.100
This thing, put it back
in the... Yeah.

43:57.132 --> 43:58.134
- Oh.
- There we go.

43:58.168 --> 44:00.137
I hate this backpack so much.

44:01.237 --> 44:02.205
You got a little banged up.

44:02.237 --> 44:03.672
You're starting to look
like a real climber.

44:03.706 --> 44:05.676
- Oh, yeah?
- How'd you like the chimney?

44:07.043 --> 44:08.078
It was pretty fun.

44:08.110 --> 44:09.112
Yeah, it's pretty fun.

44:09.145 --> 44:10.647
Even with the backpack.

44:15.717 --> 44:16.920
Okay, I'm safe!

44:17.753 --> 44:18.955
Ah, what?

44:18.987 --> 44:20.757
All right,
you're on belay, Rose.

44:22.058 --> 44:22.960
Climbing.

44:23.393 --> 44:24.360
Climb on.

46:23.346 --> 46:25.949
Well, this next move's
the pendulum pitch.

46:25.982 --> 46:26.782
Pendulum?

46:26.815 --> 46:30.085
Yeah, it's a swinging
across move.

46:30.118 --> 46:31.787
Once you commit,
there's no turning back.

46:32.688 --> 46:34.123
So what's your point?

46:34.156 --> 46:35.925
Well, are you sure you still
wanna keep going?

46:35.958 --> 46:37.560
Uh-huh. I feel great.

46:37.592 --> 46:38.861
- Let's keep going.
- Okay.

46:39.761 --> 46:41.898
Okay. Follow my lead.

46:42.397 --> 46:43.299
All right.

46:45.969 --> 46:46.837
Bye.

47:21.304 --> 47:22.239
Brett?

47:24.306 --> 47:25.408
Okay, I'm safe.

47:27.176 --> 47:28.946
Okay. On rappel.

47:55.038 --> 47:57.507
- Here, a bomber. Almost.
- Oh, shit!

47:57.540 --> 47:59.375
Run faster, Rose.

47:59.409 --> 48:00.978
- You got this.
- Okay.

48:02.344 --> 48:03.580
Holy shit.

48:07.850 --> 48:10.087
This time, run across,
just go for my hand.

48:17.560 --> 48:18.695
Yeah, yeah.

48:18.728 --> 48:20.130
Oh, shit.

48:20.862 --> 48:22.264
Ah. Ow.

48:22.297 --> 48:23.600
You all right?

48:23.632 --> 48:24.600
Okay.

48:30.339 --> 48:32.342
Can you grab some
of those friends for me?

48:40.650 --> 48:42.519
- What the fuck was that?
- I don't know!

48:45.020 --> 48:47.423
Oh, fuck. That was
a number four, Rose.

48:47.456 --> 48:48.391
We needed that.

48:48.424 --> 48:49.426
Okay, I'm sorry.

48:49.458 --> 48:50.359
Okay, I hope you are.

48:51.326 --> 48:52.628
The fuck you do.

48:52.661 --> 48:54.930
Come on, it's...
Just help me on belay.

50:24.319 --> 50:25.287
Hi.

50:36.898 --> 50:38.034
How's this look?

50:39.467 --> 50:40.837
What?

50:40.869 --> 50:42.505
Um, the way I'm looking at you.

50:43.471 --> 50:44.406
It's still too much?

50:47.009 --> 50:48.277
It's growing on me.

50:49.244 --> 50:50.147
Okay.

50:51.913 --> 50:54.183
I think she likes it.

52:20.703 --> 52:21.804
Argh!

52:22.471 --> 52:23.540
Brett!

52:24.607 --> 52:25.708
Brett!

52:27.476 --> 52:28.578
Brett!

52:31.880 --> 52:33.250
Brett, are you okay?

52:44.360 --> 52:45.561
You gotta come over
to me, okay?

52:45.594 --> 52:48.130
I'm gonna throw you the rope.
You gotta hold on.

52:53.668 --> 52:56.705
Okay, I'm gonna throw you
the rope, you gotta hold on.

52:56.739 --> 52:58.141
Brett!

52:58.973 --> 53:00.409
Wait for me.

53:01.576 --> 53:04.246
Brett, I can't get
any further! Come on!

53:06.214 --> 53:07.683
Keep coming!

53:07.717 --> 53:09.252
Argh!

53:12.888 --> 53:14.123
Ah!

53:18.060 --> 53:20.263
Get here.

53:20.696 --> 53:22.197
What happened?

53:22.230 --> 53:23.667
Ah, my shoulder.

53:24.967 --> 53:26.735
- Oh, shit, Brett.
- Careful, careful.

53:26.768 --> 53:28.103
Oh, sorry.

53:28.136 --> 53:29.371
Oh, fuck. What do we do?

53:29.404 --> 53:31.774
What do we do?
We're kind of fucked.

53:32.808 --> 53:34.076
- "We're kind of fucked"?
- Yeah.

53:34.110 --> 53:35.545
That's what you wanna say
to me right now?

53:36.411 --> 53:37.813
Can we just go back
the way we came?

53:37.846 --> 53:38.848
No.

53:38.880 --> 53:40.350
Ah. Can we swing back?

53:40.382 --> 53:41.516
No, it won't reach.

53:41.549 --> 53:43.652
Well, there's gotta be
something we can do.

53:43.685 --> 53:45.654
There is, but you're
not gonna like it.

53:45.688 --> 53:46.622
What?

53:46.654 --> 53:47.790
You have to lead this.

53:47.822 --> 53:48.725
What?

53:48.757 --> 53:50.092
You have to lead climb this.

53:50.125 --> 53:52.227
No way. You just fell.
How the hell am I supposed to climb that?

53:52.261 --> 53:53.929
A hold broke. That happens.

53:53.962 --> 53:55.098
And it'll happen again.

53:55.130 --> 53:56.531
No, you can't think
like that, Rose.

53:56.565 --> 53:59.235
No. We're gonna sit here until
somebody comes over here.

53:59.268 --> 54:00.570
- Nobody's gonna come up here.
- Why not?

54:00.603 --> 54:02.138
- Other climbers take the route.
- It could be days

54:02.170 --> 54:04.107
- till another climber does this route.
- Somebody will hear us.

54:04.139 --> 54:05.141
- Help!
- No one's gonna hear it.

54:05.174 --> 54:06.309
- Help! Somebody!
- Rose. Rose...

54:06.342 --> 54:07.510
- Rose!
- What?

54:07.543 --> 54:09.813
Please, just listen
to me, okay?

54:11.112 --> 54:13.549
The only way down is up.

54:15.384 --> 54:17.152
Now, you see that ledge
up there?

54:17.185 --> 54:19.888
You need to lead climb
up to that ledge

54:19.922 --> 54:21.023
and build an anchor.

54:21.056 --> 54:22.625
I'll make a prusik with these

54:22.657 --> 54:24.159
and make my way
up the fixed line.

54:24.192 --> 54:26.830
We'll keep doing that
all the way up to the top.

54:27.563 --> 54:28.665
I can't do that.

54:30.565 --> 54:32.502
No, I'm sorry. I can't do it.

54:32.969 --> 54:34.371
Rose, you climb...

54:36.272 --> 54:37.474
or we die.

54:55.790 --> 54:57.426
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

54:57.826 --> 54:58.962
Okay. Okay.

55:01.130 --> 55:02.532
All right,
talk me through this

55:02.565 --> 55:05.235
'cause I have no fucking clue
what I'm doing.

55:07.101 --> 55:08.237
All right.

55:10.873 --> 55:12.508
All right, look...

55:12.540 --> 55:14.376
- I'll put you on belay.
- Okay.

55:40.802 --> 55:41.904
Oh, shit.

57:56.871 --> 57:58.907
Yeah. There you go.

58:01.076 --> 58:02.078
Can you just...

58:03.177 --> 58:05.013
I got ya. Oh, God.

58:05.913 --> 58:06.915
Good.

58:08.484 --> 58:09.953
Oh, my God.

58:18.661 --> 58:19.628
Brett.

58:21.096 --> 58:22.197
Hey, stay awake.

58:23.031 --> 58:24.633
- Okay.
- All right.

58:25.333 --> 58:26.602
Yeah?

58:28.369 --> 58:29.438
Can you talk to me?

58:30.839 --> 58:31.708
Yeah?

58:32.174 --> 58:33.141
Oh, it's you.

58:33.174 --> 58:34.443
What to talk about?

58:36.177 --> 58:37.112
I don't know.

58:38.913 --> 58:40.482
How did you become

58:40.516 --> 58:42.085
such a badass rock climber?

58:55.297 --> 58:56.465
My father...

58:58.433 --> 58:59.569
used to

59:00.168 --> 59:01.638
take me to a summer camp

59:02.371 --> 59:03.906
at Yosemite every year.

59:05.406 --> 59:06.808
That's where I learned to climb.

59:09.444 --> 59:10.812
That's where
I fell in love with it.

59:13.681 --> 59:15.118
It was the only thing

59:16.518 --> 59:17.820
that made me feel free.

59:19.020 --> 59:19.888
Hmm.

59:23.458 --> 59:24.893
What was home like?

59:32.301 --> 59:33.168
Empty.

01:00:17.779 --> 01:00:18.814
Brett.

01:00:20.848 --> 01:00:21.850
Brett.

01:00:25.219 --> 01:00:26.089
Brett.

01:00:26.388 --> 01:00:27.255
Hey.

01:00:28.456 --> 01:00:29.324
Hey.

01:00:30.025 --> 01:00:30.960
How are you doing?

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:32.628
Can you sit up?

01:00:33.295 --> 01:00:34.630
- Can you sit up?
- Yeah.

01:00:37.933 --> 01:00:39.101
Here we go.

01:00:39.134 --> 01:00:40.770
Just, yeah, perfect.

01:00:41.103 --> 01:00:41.971
Good.

01:00:55.884 --> 01:00:56.753
Shit.

01:01:00.822 --> 01:01:01.690
Open up.

01:01:02.590 --> 01:01:03.726
Tilt your head back.

01:01:08.697 --> 01:01:09.866
Sorry.

01:01:10.699 --> 01:01:12.067
Okay? You okay.

01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:13.069
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:01:14.002 --> 01:01:14.871
You finish it?

01:01:17.672 --> 01:01:19.375
All right, we gotta
keep going, okay?

01:01:19.407 --> 01:01:20.710
- Can you stay with me?
- Yeah.

01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:26.848
Look at this.

01:01:28.717 --> 01:01:30.119
This is where
we need to go, all right?

01:01:31.453 --> 01:01:32.889
Can you see it?
Can you focus?

01:01:34.223 --> 01:01:35.090
Good.

01:01:43.598 --> 01:01:44.966
Where are we going, hmm?

01:01:45.701 --> 01:01:46.769
Can you tell me?

01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:50.373
Yeah, you have to go up
that right crack.

01:01:55.277 --> 01:01:56.145
There we go.

01:01:56.645 --> 01:01:57.746
Good.

01:01:59.815 --> 01:02:01.150
- We gotta get moving, all right?
- Yeah.

01:02:03.217 --> 01:02:04.085
You got it?

01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:08.156
All right. Stay with me, okay?

01:02:09.223 --> 01:02:10.658
Climbing.

01:02:10.692 --> 01:02:12.061
- Climb off.
- All right.

01:03:34.141 --> 01:03:36.411
Okay, Brett.
Rope is fixed.

01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:22.778
Rose!

01:06:22.810 --> 01:06:23.678
Ahhh!

01:06:37.558 --> 01:06:39.861
Hey, did Brett and Rose
sleep here last night?

01:06:39.895 --> 01:06:42.197
Uh, no, I thought
they were at his campsite.

01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:44.065
No, they are not there.

01:06:44.098 --> 01:06:45.366
Do you know
what route they went on?

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:48.003
No,
but that was over 24 hours ago.

01:06:48.036 --> 01:06:51.139
Hey, Jackie. Did Brett and Rose tell
you where they were going yesterday?

01:06:51.172 --> 01:06:53.375
Yeah, as a matter of fact.
Killer Pillar.

01:06:53.842 --> 01:06:54.710
Oh, crap.

01:06:55.442 --> 01:06:56.944
Brett.

01:06:56.978 --> 01:07:00.415
Brett has something of a reputation
of getting benighted on long routes.

01:07:00.447 --> 01:07:02.650
We should think about
organizing a search party.

01:07:19.266 --> 01:07:21.569
There's nothing up here, Brett.
It is completely blank.

01:07:33.514 --> 01:07:36.118
I am fine. I am fine.

01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:52.768
Hey.

01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:14.389
Brett.

01:08:16.890 --> 01:08:17.759
Brett.

01:08:20.728 --> 01:08:21.596
Brett.

01:08:22.496 --> 01:08:23.365
Brett.

01:08:23.932 --> 01:08:24.800
Hey.

01:08:25.499 --> 01:08:27.203
Hey. Hey.

01:08:27.435 --> 01:08:28.304
Hey.

01:08:28.969 --> 01:08:30.071
Are you okay?

01:08:30.104 --> 01:08:32.140
- You okay?
- Yeah. It's just...

01:08:32.573 --> 01:08:33.642
Huh?

01:08:33.674 --> 01:08:35.042
- Am I gonna die?
- No.

01:08:35.343 --> 01:08:36.212
Hey.

01:08:37.312 --> 01:08:38.180
You okay?

01:08:41.482 --> 01:08:43.216
Look at me.
I need you to stay with me.

01:08:43.250 --> 01:08:45.486
- I need you to hold me tight, all right?
- Okay.

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:46.787
I can do this, okay?

01:08:46.819 --> 01:08:47.822
I can do this.

01:09:37.971 --> 01:09:39.274
Oh, crap.

01:12:09.257 --> 01:12:11.125
You got it, come on.

01:12:11.159 --> 01:12:12.628
Come on, you are so close,
come on.

01:13:15.757 --> 01:13:16.625
That's it.

01:13:34.374 --> 01:13:35.511
I got you.

01:13:38.679 --> 01:13:40.347
There you go. There you go.

01:13:54.896 --> 01:13:56.130
You did it, Brett.

01:13:57.264 --> 01:13:58.133
Oh, you did it.

01:14:45.213 --> 01:14:46.514
Okay, we'll head up
into the watch,

01:14:46.547 --> 01:14:47.616
and then we'll split up.

01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:27.122
All right, buddy.

01:15:29.824 --> 01:15:30.924
Let's go.

01:15:30.958 --> 01:15:31.826
Come on.

01:16:22.543 --> 01:16:23.812
Hold on. Hold on.

01:16:26.313 --> 01:16:28.683
All right. Ready?
Here we go.

01:16:30.151 --> 01:16:31.153
Ahhh!

01:16:37.859 --> 01:16:38.927
That's it.

01:16:39.727 --> 01:16:41.630
That's it. Good.
Good.

01:16:46.968 --> 01:16:47.836
Oh, God.

01:16:48.169 --> 01:16:49.037
Sit up.

01:16:49.870 --> 01:16:51.271
Sit up.

01:16:51.304 --> 01:16:52.773
You got to stand up, Brett.

01:16:52.807 --> 01:16:54.709
You got to stand up.
There you go.

01:16:54.741 --> 01:16:56.343
There you go.
Come on.

01:16:56.377 --> 01:16:57.411
Look at me.

01:16:57.445 --> 01:16:58.346
Right there.

01:16:58.379 --> 01:16:59.781
Okay. Okay?

01:16:59.813 --> 01:17:01.115
All right? You got this.

01:17:01.148 --> 01:17:02.683
Come on. Come on.

01:17:08.388 --> 01:17:09.456
Come on.

01:17:09.490 --> 01:17:10.892
Come on.

01:17:10.924 --> 01:17:13.928
Stay with me, Brett.
Come on. Yes.

01:17:14.395 --> 01:17:15.463
Good. Good.

01:17:15.495 --> 01:17:17.598
I got you. I got you.
Good.

01:17:43.391 --> 01:17:44.392
I got you.

01:17:44.424 --> 01:17:45.293
There you go.

01:17:46.994 --> 01:17:47.862
Jesus.

01:18:55.428 --> 01:18:56.297
It's them.

01:19:03.803 --> 01:19:05.072
Hello, Jackie.

01:19:05.106 --> 01:19:06.307
Rose. Rose.

01:19:06.339 --> 01:19:08.043
We found them in the wash.
We need your help.

01:19:10.076 --> 01:19:11.145
How's he doing, man?

01:19:11.178 --> 01:19:12.781
He's breathing.
He's got a pulse.

01:19:27.361 --> 01:19:28.496
You ready?

01:19:28.529 --> 01:19:31.900
On three. One, two, three.

01:19:52.753 --> 01:19:54.188
One, two, three.

01:20:00.061 --> 01:20:00.929
Rose.

01:20:01.963 --> 01:20:02.864
Come on.

01:20:14.508 --> 01:20:15.377
Easy.

01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:20.248
Okay.

01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:21.381
Hold.

01:20:21.414 --> 01:20:22.283
One, two, three.

01:22:54.101 --> 01:22:56.337
- Hi.
- How's that shoulder feeling?

01:22:57.338 --> 01:22:59.373
- It's actually not that bad.
- Yeah?

01:22:59.405 --> 01:23:01.708
Just can't do anything
physical with it yet.

01:23:01.741 --> 01:23:03.444
So that's what Jackie
was talking about.

01:23:03.477 --> 01:23:04.612
What's that?

01:23:04.645 --> 01:23:06.013
Just listening to your body.

01:23:06.045 --> 01:23:08.182
- Oh, yeah? I'm listening.
- Hmm.

01:23:08.214 --> 01:23:11.752
- Letting it guide you.
- Guiding.

01:23:11.785 --> 01:23:14.489
My body has a lot to
say right now, so...

01:23:14.521 --> 01:23:16.190
I hope that's not
too physical for you.

01:23:16.624 --> 01:23:18.192
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:23:18.225 --> 01:23:19.427
What's up?

01:23:21.195 --> 01:23:22.396
- How are you?
- Good.

01:23:22.428 --> 01:23:24.298
- How have you been?
- I've been good.

01:23:24.999 --> 01:23:26.501
- You ready to go?
- Yeah.

01:23:26.534 --> 01:23:27.502
- Yeah?
- Come on.

01:23:28.936 --> 01:23:30.004
Hey, Rose.
