00:13.346 --> 00:15.515
<i>Previously on </i>Star Trek: Discovery:

00:15.598 --> 00:18.268
<i>We are creating a new way to fly.</i>

00:18.351 --> 00:21.563
<i>If the </i>Discovery<i> can be anywhere</i>
<i>and gone in an instant,</i>

00:21.646 --> 00:23.523
<i>that's how you beat the Klingons.</i>

00:24.649 --> 00:28.319
The only other female Michael
I ever heard of was the mutineer.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.447
You're not her, are you?

00:30.530 --> 00:34.492
I'd like to extend an official invitation
to you to join the <i>Discovery</i>.

00:34.576 --> 00:38.413
8000 are dead because of you.
-8186.

00:39.414 --> 00:42.292
<i>Klingons won't stop</i>
<i>until they've destroyed everything.</i>

00:42.792 --> 00:45.462
And we can't stop them without you.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.547
Who is she to you?

00:48.131 --> 00:50.508
<i> Her name is L'Rell.</i>
<i>She was my torturer.</i>

00:50.842 --> 00:53.553
<i>If none of that had happened,</i>
<i>I wouldn't be here.</i>

00:54.095 --> 00:55.430
What did you do to me?

00:55.513 --> 00:57.640
I will never let them hurt you.

00:58.516 --> 01:01.269
<i>I'll do one more jump.</i>
<i>Only one more jump.</i>

01:05.523 --> 01:08.610
Computer is reading it
as an incomplete navigation sequence.

01:15.116 --> 01:18.328
Captain, I'm afraid
I don't know where we are.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.933
Yellow alert.
<i>Yellow alert.</i>

01:40.016 --> 01:42.602
-This isn't Starbase 46.
-<i>Yellow alert.</i>

01:42.685 --> 01:45.230
Our sensors are...

01:46.189 --> 01:48.691
-recalibrating, sir.

01:49.400 --> 01:52.070
I don't remember reports of battles
anywhere near Organia.

01:52.153 --> 01:55.115
Blast, scoring, and damage patterns
are consistent with Federation weapons,

01:55.198 --> 01:58.409
-but the hull signatures are a little off.

01:58.493 --> 02:00.745
Wreckage is Klingon,
but hull density analysis

02:00.829 --> 02:03.498
is registering outside acceptable margins.

02:03.998 --> 02:07.377
-No life signs or power signatures.

02:07.460 --> 02:08.628
Small favors.

02:09.671 --> 02:12.423
Captain, our navigational array
is malfunctioning.

02:12.507 --> 02:15.677
According to these readings,
we jumped to our intended coordinates.

02:15.760 --> 02:18.972
And our position relative
to the galactic center is confirmed.

02:19.055 --> 02:21.683
But almost nothing else
is where it's supposed to be.

02:25.895 --> 02:29.315
Nice of you to join us, Mr. Tyler.
I know it was only a yellow alert.

02:29.399 --> 02:30.233
Sorry, sir.

02:30.316 --> 02:33.403
Captain, a vessel is approaching
at sub light speed.

02:33.486 --> 02:35.989
-Seems like a Vulcan cruiser.
On screen.

02:36.072 --> 02:38.616
<i>Verify materialization</i>
<i>sequence underway.</i>

02:41.244 --> 02:43.746
The Vulcans must be the ones
who destroyed those Klingons.

02:43.830 --> 02:46.708
Yes, open a channel.

02:46.791 --> 02:50.879
Unidentified Vulcan cruiser,
this is the <i>U.S.S. Discovery. </i>Respond.

02:50.962 --> 02:53.339
Captain, the Vulcans
are powering up weapons.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.925
They must have registered
an active Klingon ship nearby.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.218
Red alert. Shields up.

03:03.558 --> 03:05.435
Detmer, evasive pattern beta four pi.

03:06.644 --> 03:08.897
-They're doubling back.
Unable to lock on.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.857
Manually shoot in their direction.

03:14.652 --> 03:15.945
Where did that assist come from?

03:16.029 --> 03:18.740
Incoming transmission from the<i> Cooper.</i>
Audio only.

03:19.282 --> 03:22.410
<i>Cooper?</i> Isn't she supposed
to be undergoing a refit?

03:23.286 --> 03:24.495
Send it through.

03:25.288 --> 03:28.625
<i>Spooked by rebels, </i>Discovery<i>?</i>
<i>You're losing your edge.</i>

03:28.708 --> 03:31.127
<i>Don't worry, we'll take care of them.</i>
Cooper <i>out.</i>

03:32.754 --> 03:36.132
Vulcan rebels

03:36.216 --> 03:38.218
Engineering, status of the spore drive?

03:38.301 --> 03:40.595
Lieutenant Stamets is nonresponsive.

03:41.471 --> 03:44.474
He's stabilized, but no way
he can get back into that reaction cube.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.517
<i>Spore drive is offline, Captain.</i>

03:46.601 --> 03:50.271
I may have something.
The quantum signature of the <i>Cooper,</i> as well as that of the Vulcan cruiser,
are inconsistent with ours.

03:54.108 --> 03:57.278
That's not possible.
All matter native to our universe

03:57.362 --> 04:00.323
resonates with the same quantum signature.
Nothing can change it.

04:00.406 --> 04:01.449
That's true.

04:02.784 --> 04:03.618
Unless...

04:09.082 --> 04:11.501
this is not our universe.

05:54.937 --> 05:59.108
Obviously, the idea of parallel worlds
has been around since the 20th century.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.319
And you and Stamets believed
the spore drive

06:01.402 --> 06:05.031
-It was a theory I was working on.

06:05.114 --> 06:08.076
Stamets was keen to chase it with me
after the war.

06:08.785 --> 06:12.288
But these areas don't correlate
to anything in the known universe.

06:12.955 --> 06:16.542
We suspected the mycelial network
extended beyond anything imagined.

06:16.626 --> 06:19.253
A vast system
underpinning all quantum realities.

06:19.337 --> 06:22.840
But the exact coordinates of the more
esoteric destinations eluded us.

06:24.175 --> 06:27.261
Apparently the 133 jumps we made
filled in the gaps.

06:27.345 --> 06:28.888
Extraordinarily fortunate coincidence.

06:28.971 --> 06:31.516
I'd say unfortunate.
Wouldn't you, Number One?

06:32.600 --> 06:33.768
It's worse than that.

06:33.851 --> 06:36.729
The Klingon cloak-breaking algorithm
we've been refining,

06:37.230 --> 06:41.192
-no way we can send that to Starfleet now.
-That's why we have to make it back.

06:41.275 --> 06:44.529
Otherwise, the ships are sitting ducks.
The war's as good as lost.

06:44.612 --> 06:46.823
Stamets brought us here accidentally.

06:46.906 --> 06:49.742
We should examine the spore drive's
navigational logs closely--

06:49.826 --> 06:52.995
I pushed Stamets too hard.
The number of jumps scrambled his ability

06:53.079 --> 06:55.540
to hold the coordinates for Starbase 46
in his head.

06:56.082 --> 06:59.710
We need to understand where we are
and how to survive.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.712
Then we'll find a way home.

07:02.380 --> 07:04.841
Recalibrate sensors.
You look at the wreckage.

07:04.924 --> 07:07.009
-See if there's something we can learn.
-Yes, Captain.

07:08.886 --> 07:11.180
It's a palace. Stay close.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.349
Lieutenant Stamets, please don't hate me.

07:13.724 --> 07:16.144
But what is
the spore germination rate again?

07:17.562 --> 07:19.605
And, I know you always have to remind me,

07:19.689 --> 07:23.067
but, uh, the ideal moisture level
in the cultivation bay

07:23.151 --> 07:25.903
is 85 or 87 percent relative humidity?

07:29.115 --> 07:29.949
Um...

07:30.491 --> 07:36.247
I was just-- I was hoping I could maybe
jog his memory with familiar things.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.583
Mainly how annoying he finds me.

07:40.751 --> 07:44.464
He's in a state of neurological
disregulation unlike anything I've seen.

07:45.381 --> 07:46.382
It's a palace.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.176
-Paul. Paul, no.
-To the palace--

07:48.259 --> 07:50.219
Oh, my God.

07:51.929 --> 07:53.222
I'm okay.

08:09.614 --> 08:10.823
I'm so sorry.

08:12.158 --> 08:15.620
I should've told you
about the side effects from the jumps.

08:15.703 --> 08:19.874
-I shouldn't have kept it secret.
-Paul's your superior. He gave an order.

08:21.876 --> 08:23.002
You didn't do this.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.632
-Speak of the devil.
-Cadet, excuse us.

08:27.715 --> 08:29.759
-Yes, sir.
<i>Commander Gotthelf,</i>

08:29.842 --> 08:31.427
<i>please report immediately to Deck 2.</i>

08:33.513 --> 08:34.347
How is he?

08:36.641 --> 08:38.309
Alternately catatonic,

08:38.768 --> 08:41.312
then prone to bursts
of nonsensical speech.

08:41.854 --> 08:46.442
He's contained for his own safety.
Adrenals are spiking uncontrollably.

08:48.903 --> 08:51.948
I don't know if he'll ever be the same,
let alone jump again.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.161
I know you blame me for this
and you're right.

08:58.412 --> 09:01.165
I'm his captain.
I'm responsible for his well-being.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.083
Yes.

09:03.292 --> 09:04.293
You were.

09:05.086 --> 09:07.755
Fortunately, his well-being falls
to me now.

09:08.923 --> 09:09.966
I'm afraid not.

09:11.592 --> 09:14.303
I've decided to hand his case over
to another doctor.

09:15.888 --> 09:16.722
No.

09:16.806 --> 09:19.517
Medicine requires
professional objectivity, Dr. Culber,

09:19.600 --> 09:23.938
and your bias,
your personal bias compromises that.

09:24.021 --> 09:27.525
-It compromises his recovery.
-Suddenly you care about protocol.

09:28.025 --> 09:31.237
You wanted me to fake Stamets'
medical records as a smoke screen.

09:31.320 --> 09:34.323
I bought you time so you coud push him
into all those jumps

09:34.407 --> 09:36.409
and break the Klingon cloak.

09:36.909 --> 09:37.785
So he did.

09:38.494 --> 09:39.328
So <i>we</i> did.

09:39.412 --> 09:42.748
I'm most qualified to care for him.
Do you even want him to get better?

09:43.958 --> 09:47.545
-You're too emotional to handle this.

09:48.421 --> 09:52.133
Maybe I let my emotions carry me away,
my need to win the war.

09:54.552 --> 09:55.845
Look where it got us.

09:57.513 --> 09:59.557
-You have your orders.

10:12.153 --> 10:14.905
<i>I'm detecting what looks to be</i>
<i>a Klingon central data core</i>

10:14.989 --> 10:16.324
<i>in that wreckage.</i>

10:16.866 --> 10:19.535
<i>Inside a larger debris array,</i>
<i>200 meters ahead of you.</i>

10:19.619 --> 10:21.537
<i>Glad sensors are working again.</i>

10:22.079 --> 10:23.581
Vulcan high

10:23.664 --> 10:26.459
-And good old-fashioned human know-how.
-Copy that.

10:30.921 --> 10:32.048
Readings are good.

10:32.131 --> 10:34.592
I think the data core is intact.
If we can bring it onboard,

10:34.675 --> 10:37.470
we can get a crash course
on what Klingons knew about this universe.

10:37.553 --> 10:40.598
-Proceed with extraction.
<i>Closing in on the cockpit.</i>

10:40.681 --> 10:43.809
<i>The core is likely part</i>
<i>of the main computer, rear of the ship.</i>

10:43.893 --> 10:45.728
<i>Should be easy enough to extract.</i>

11:01.035 --> 11:02.578
Seeing bodies in there.

11:13.714 --> 11:15.925
Why can't he maintain course?

11:17.510 --> 11:19.011
Is flight control malfunctioning?

11:21.764 --> 11:23.182
-Burnham.
-There are no life signs

11:23.265 --> 11:25.976
in that wreckage, Lieutenant.
You're all clear.

11:26.477 --> 11:28.646
<i></i>

11:30.689 --> 11:32.483
<i>-Tyler.</i>

11:38.030 --> 11:39.532
What the hell's he doing?

11:39.615 --> 11:42.910
Lieutenant Tyler, get in there
and extract that data core.

11:45.579 --> 11:47.289
Aye, sir. Proceeding.

11:48.624 --> 11:50.209
Approaching the Klingon raider.

11:51.460 --> 11:52.628
The bodies are...

11:54.588 --> 11:56.006
a Vulcan and Andorian.

11:57.883 --> 11:59.677
A Vulcan and an Andorian

11:59.760 --> 12:01.429
commanding a Klingon ship?

12:02.179 --> 12:03.973
<i>I've located the data core.</i>

12:04.515 --> 12:07.309
Looks intact. I'll have to clear
some of the hull around it

12:07.393 --> 12:09.437
with the laser cannon to extract cleanly.

12:09.979 --> 12:12.773
<i>Proceed with extreme caution, Lieutenant.</i>

12:12.857 --> 12:16.652
<i>The slightest nick could corrupt the data</i>
<i>or destroy the core completely.</i>

12:33.961 --> 12:36.922
<i>Debris surface analysis is nonconclusive.</i>

12:48.225 --> 12:49.059
Got it.

12:53.898 --> 12:56.650
Get it to engineering as fast as possible,
Lieutenant.

13:04.450 --> 13:05.868
You can relax, too.

13:07.369 --> 13:08.454
He's safe now.

13:09.789 --> 13:10.664
Sir?

13:11.540 --> 13:15.336
I need to know I can rely on my crew
to act professionally at all times.

13:16.086 --> 13:18.130
Particularly now
we're in dangerous waters.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.967
So, can I count on you, Burnham?

13:23.385 --> 13:24.470
Yes, sir.

13:26.555 --> 13:27.598
Good.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.620
What are you doing standing there?

13:52.706 --> 13:54.250
You can't hurt me anymore.

13:55.209 --> 13:57.253
Now, why would I want to hurt you?

13:58.003 --> 13:59.296
What did you do to me?

14:00.130 --> 14:01.257
On the prison ship.

14:02.007 --> 14:04.510
-Tell me.
-You know what we did.

14:07.346 --> 14:08.472
We did it together.

14:10.432 --> 14:12.184
So many things.

14:13.435 --> 14:16.438
-You have such appetites.
-You forced me.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.899
Does thinking that make you feel better?

14:20.025 --> 14:23.696
I'm having flashes of things,
things... I don't remember.

14:24.238 --> 14:26.282
Procedures, surgeries.

14:26.824 --> 14:27.908
Sweet Tyler,

14:28.534 --> 14:29.785
open the cell,

14:30.870 --> 14:34.415
and I'll tell you everything
you want to know.

14:42.256 --> 14:43.257
Very good.

14:45.467 --> 14:47.219
So much more...

14:51.473 --> 14:52.558
familiar.

15:00.941 --> 15:01.775
Tell me.

15:04.028 --> 15:05.571
Whom do we seek?

15:09.408 --> 15:10.367
Kahless.

15:10.951 --> 15:12.244
How do we find him?

15:12.328 --> 15:13.787
Together.

15:13.871 --> 15:17.207
Kahless, give us light to see.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.876
Forever.

15:18.959 --> 15:22.463
Will he hide from us always?

15:23.005 --> 15:23.923
Never.

15:24.214 --> 15:25.299
Never.

15:25.966 --> 15:28.677
<i>What is your name?</i>

15:34.183 --> 15:37.102
What did you do to me?
I'm not myself.

15:37.186 --> 15:39.063
You have another name. Say it.

15:39.146 --> 15:40.314
You know what my name is!

15:40.397 --> 15:42.775
If you don't tell me what you did
to my mind, to my soul,

15:42.858 --> 15:44.526
I'm gonna make you scream it
as you die.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.111
The prayer should make you remember.

15:46.195 --> 15:49.031
-Something is wrong.
-You're damn right! Now tell me.

15:53.577 --> 15:55.496
What am I doing?
-No. No.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.794
Wait. Wait. Wait.

16:05.714 --> 16:07.716
You will come back to me.

16:19.645 --> 16:23.107
<i>Attention, all personnel,</i>
<i>black alert drills for Deck 7</i>

16:23.190 --> 16:25.442
<i>have been canceled until further notice.</i>

16:29.863 --> 16:31.198
Isik for your thoughts?

16:33.325 --> 16:35.703
-It's an old Vulcan saying.

16:35.786 --> 16:38.789
-No one knows where it comes from.
-Must make it hard to cash in.

16:50.217 --> 16:51.635
What happened out there?

16:52.219 --> 16:53.429
In the worker bee.

16:53.971 --> 16:55.055
What do you mean?

16:57.266 --> 17:00.185
<i>Security briefing</i>
<i>on Deck 1 in five minutes.</i>

17:00.853 --> 17:01.895
It happened again.

17:02.563 --> 17:04.940
The flashes of memory. Worse this time.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.152
Things I hadn't recalled about my torture.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.112
Thanks for covering.

17:15.659 --> 17:18.787
-You have to tell the captain.
-I know. And I can't.

17:18.871 --> 17:19.997
Why?

17:20.080 --> 17:23.959
PTSD regs require full-duty quarantine
until you can get treatment.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.170
We're in another universe.
How close do you think

17:29.048 --> 17:32.217
-It might be around the corner.
Maybe.

17:33.635 --> 17:36.096
But until that turns out to be true,
I need you to trust me.

17:39.641 --> 17:40.809
What you went through

17:40.893 --> 17:43.187
-on the <i>Ship of the Dead</i>--
-Was a one-off.

17:43.645 --> 17:45.564
Seeing those Klingons took me by surprise.

17:45.647 --> 17:47.274
I can manage this, all right?

17:47.357 --> 17:50.402
You just saw me manage this.
You helped me manage...

17:52.196 --> 17:54.198
Just let me try and handle things.

17:55.532 --> 17:58.202
At least for a little while,
till we get home.

17:58.285 --> 18:00.788
-Then I'll tell you. I promise.

18:08.545 --> 18:11.173
-I'm taking you at your word, Starfleet.

18:11.256 --> 18:14.384
<i>Specialist Burnham,</i>
<i>please report to engineering.</i>

18:17.012 --> 18:18.138
Duty calls.

18:50.921 --> 18:54.800
The data core from the Klingon vessel,
I got it open.

18:54.883 --> 18:56.093
Well done, Tilly.

18:58.011 --> 18:59.054
It's strange.

19:00.097 --> 19:04.309
The core itself is Klingon,
but these data chips are a Vulcan design.

19:05.352 --> 19:08.230
It should be compatible
with our universal interface.

19:08.730 --> 19:11.775
With this fused data technology
and their sharing of ships,

19:12.609 --> 19:14.236
is it possible that in this universe,

19:14.319 --> 19:18.657
the Vulcans, Andorians, and Klingons
have some sort of alliance?

19:19.408 --> 19:21.368
Allied against

19:22.953 --> 19:25.414
I'm gonna get into the interface
and try to figure this out.

19:31.044 --> 19:32.212
I know.

19:33.505 --> 19:34.423
Me too.

19:35.132 --> 19:37.134
It's weird being here without him.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.720
But he's gonna get better.

19:40.762 --> 19:43.098
-Of course he does.

19:49.771 --> 19:52.399
All right,
let the xenoanthropologist get to work.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.908
I'm downloading the Klingon raider's logs.

20:00.991 --> 20:04.286
Images, battle plans,
intelligence we found from the core.

20:04.661 --> 20:07.998
And so far, we can conclude
that are indeed in a parallel universe.

20:08.832 --> 20:13.128
One not governed by the Federation,
but by a fascistic human-only organization

20:13.212 --> 20:14.671
known as the Terran Empire.

20:16.131 --> 20:20.177
Most places and ships in our universe,
like the <i>Cooper, </i>exist here.

20:20.761 --> 20:23.055
-Same goes for people.
-You mean, we could meet

20:23.138 --> 20:25.933
Theoretically, yes.

20:26.016 --> 20:26.850
Wow.

20:27.351 --> 20:30.646
The Terrans appear to be
the antithesis of us in every way.

20:32.731 --> 20:35.901
They're an oppressive, racist,
xenophobic culture

20:36.610 --> 20:38.487
that dominates all known space.

20:38.820 --> 20:40.948
And they're ruled by a faceless emperor.

20:41.031 --> 20:44.076
-They're part of a rebellion.

20:44.159 --> 20:47.287
That is made up essentially
of all nonhuman species.

20:47.371 --> 20:48.622
They're fighting for freedom.

20:50.540 --> 20:53.168
The rebellion fears and mistrusts humans.

20:53.710 --> 20:56.088
The Terran culture appears
to be predicated upon

20:56.171 --> 21:00.467
an unconditional hatred and rejection
of anything and everything other.

21:00.550 --> 21:01.885
That means us.

21:02.427 --> 21:04.888
No way we're asking these neighbors
for a cup of sugar.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.850
<i>Captain to the bridge. Incoming vessel.</i>

21:08.934 --> 21:10.852
-<i>It's the </i>Cooper<i>.</i>
-On our way.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.773
We're being hailed.
They're asking to speak with the captain.

21:14.856 --> 21:17.567
-They think we're their <i>Discovery.</i>

21:17.651 --> 21:20.112
Scanning records
from the core download. Wait.

21:21.321 --> 21:24.449
Rebel logs show their ships being attacked
by a vessel

21:24.533 --> 21:27.035
with a warp signature matching
our <i>Discovery.</i>

21:27.119 --> 21:30.414
But with a quantum signature
matching this universe.

21:30.497 --> 21:31.707
They're hailing again.

21:31.790 --> 21:35.127
That signature seems to have vanished
at the same coordinates

21:35.210 --> 21:37.129
-where we popped in.
-So--

21:37.212 --> 21:40.424
It is possible we switched places
with their <i>Discovery.</i>

21:40.507 --> 21:43.677
Gonna run with Mr. Saru's theory,
hope we don't bump into ourselves

21:43.760 --> 21:45.345
-and blow our cover. Burnham--

21:45.429 --> 21:46.596
Modifying our signature

21:46.680 --> 21:48.682
-to match mirror <i>Discovery.</i>
Captain.

21:48.765 --> 21:50.642
-Hold on!
-They're saying if we don't respond,

21:50.726 --> 21:52.185
we should prepare to be fired on.

21:54.896 --> 21:57.649
-Open a channel. Audio only.
-Belay that.

21:59.693 --> 22:01.403
I'm sorry, but you can't take it, sir.

22:02.779 --> 22:05.824
Examining crew manifest of
mirror <i>Discovery, </i>you're not its captain.

22:06.575 --> 22:07.451
Who is?

22:12.205 --> 22:13.874
That-- Uh, that's me.

22:14.416 --> 22:15.334
That's me.

22:15.959 --> 22:16.793
That's absurd.

22:16.877 --> 22:18.754
-They're arming weapons.
-Cadet.

22:19.504 --> 22:22.966
-Looks like you're taking this.
Uh, what do I say?

22:23.050 --> 22:27.637
Just get rid of them as fast as possible
and you talk as little as possible.

22:27.721 --> 22:30.891
That's-- Might be a little hard.
Have you noticed that I talk a lot?

22:31.433 --> 22:32.934
Defy your every instinct.

22:33.018 --> 22:35.437
Their phases are locked on.
Should I raise shields?

22:35.520 --> 22:38.940
No. Mr. Bryce, open a channel.

22:39.024 --> 22:40.025
Aye, sir.

22:46.490 --> 22:50.243
Hello, this is Captain Tilly.
What the heck Hell. What the hell?

22:51.453 --> 22:52.496
Hold your horses.

22:55.248 --> 22:57.167
<i>This is Captain Spoeneman.</i>

22:57.250 --> 22:59.961

-I was...

23:00.879 --> 23:02.130
indisposed.

23:02.214 --> 23:05.717
<i>Everything okay over there?</i>
<i>You made quick work of those rebels.</i>

23:05.801 --> 23:09.638
<i>We got the stragglers.</i>
<i>Any reason you're hanging around?</i>

23:09.721 --> 23:12.265
<i>Expecting more kills?</i>
<i>Trying to keep them all to yourself?</i>

23:12.349 --> 23:14.434
We're experiencing mechanical issues.

23:15.060 --> 23:17.020
<i>Need a hand? We're not far.</i>

23:17.104 --> 23:18.939
<i>And why are you not on screen?</i>

23:19.481 --> 23:20.649
Mechanical issues.

23:21.525 --> 23:23.485
Here's my chief engineer.

23:26.947 --> 23:28.865
I don't know who you are here yet.

23:28.949 --> 23:30.992
Conceal your voice just in case.

23:34.955 --> 23:37.958
How you doing?
Everything's squared away here.

23:38.041 --> 23:42.129
We got trouble with our visual emitters
and the starboard nacelle.

23:42.212 --> 23:45.340
But a bit of tweaking,
we'll be good to go. All right?

23:45.882 --> 23:49.886
<i>Very well, </i>Discovery<i>.</i>
<i>More rebel nests for us. Happy hunting.</i>

23:50.512 --> 23:51.888
<i>Long live the Empire.</i> Love live the Empire.

24:00.313 --> 24:02.357
Good.

24:06.987 --> 24:07.863
Sor-- Sorry.

24:12.242 --> 24:14.327
Next time, we might not get away
with audio only.

24:14.744 --> 24:16.997
If we wanna live to get back home,

24:17.080 --> 24:21.376
we have to make it so we look
and act like we belong here.

24:22.252 --> 24:23.295
Mr. Saru,

24:24.421 --> 24:26.965
while we get up to speed
on this universe,

24:27.507 --> 24:29.718
see to it that the ship, crew...

24:30.677 --> 24:32.179
and its captain...

24:33.221 --> 24:35.182
-are prepared.
-Yes, sir.

24:37.392 --> 24:39.019
I mean, fully prepared.

24:43.648 --> 24:45.734
<i>To successfully crash a party,</i>

24:46.985 --> 24:50.780
<i>you have to look like you belong.</i>
<i>You must project confidence.</i>

24:50.864 --> 24:53.909
You gained the rank of captain
by stabbing your superior in bed.

24:53.992 --> 24:56.912
-He was recovering from Crestian flu.
-Not possible.

24:56.995 --> 24:58.455
It's more than possible.

24:59.247 --> 25:01.917
Your nicknames include
"The Slayer of Sorna Prime."

25:02.000 --> 25:04.836
<i>Every detail</i>
<i>of this so-called Terran Empire...</i>

25:06.463 --> 25:08.173
<i>must be replicated exactly.</i>

25:08.256 --> 25:10.342
"The Witch of Wurna Minor."

25:10.425 --> 25:12.135
<i>Wherever we may fall short,</i>

25:13.303 --> 25:14.721
<i>we have to get creative.</i>

25:18.558 --> 25:19.726
And finally...

25:20.644 --> 25:21.978
"Captain Killy"?

25:22.562 --> 25:23.897
That's not very clever.

25:31.988 --> 25:35.700
<i>Our very survival relies</i>
<i>on our ability to maintain this cover.</i>

25:36.201 --> 25:37.369
<i>No matter what.</i>

25:37.869 --> 25:40.997
<i>We are now the </i>I.S.S. Discovery<i>.</i>

25:51.675 --> 25:53.843
Are we civilians
What?

25:53.927 --> 25:55.804
We won't be needing them, sir.

25:55.887 --> 25:58.598
I finally found the files
on our Terran counterparts.

25:59.307 --> 26:00.267
We're not here.

26:00.892 --> 26:01.726
Where are we?

26:02.686 --> 26:06.106
I'm presumed dead.
You're a fugitive wanted for my murder.

26:08.024 --> 26:10.986
-Well, the intelligence is fragmented.

26:11.069 --> 26:13.863
Looks like most of it's been stolen
from classified Terran files.

26:14.406 --> 26:18.410
But it appears that you and I both
enjoyed immense prestige here.

26:18.493 --> 26:20.495
I was the captain of the <i>Shenzhou.</i>

26:22.122 --> 26:24.749
And you had the <i>Buran</i> here, too, sir.

26:25.750 --> 26:27.377
And my crew?

26:27.794 --> 26:28.670
They alive?

26:29.212 --> 26:30.046
No.

26:31.798 --> 26:34.134
You attempted a coup
against the emperor.

26:34.676 --> 26:35.927
I was sent to stop you.

26:36.761 --> 26:38.597
In the process, my shuttle was destroyed

26:38.680 --> 26:41.182
by one of your followers,
and I was killed.

26:41.266 --> 26:43.852
The emperor laid waste
to your ship in retaliation.

26:43.935 --> 26:45.478
It's believed you escaped.

26:47.439 --> 26:50.692
There's me hoping I'd find
a better version of myself here.

26:56.656 --> 26:57.657
Look out there.

26:58.325 --> 26:59.159
Come on.

27:04.539 --> 27:05.582
Amazing, isn't it?

27:06.750 --> 27:07.876
Different universe,

27:08.293 --> 27:11.629
and somehow the same people had a way
to find each other.

27:13.673 --> 27:17.052
The strongest argument I've ever seen
for the existence of destiny.

27:18.178 --> 27:19.971
Not sure I believe in destiny.

27:21.181 --> 27:22.307
Is that so?

27:22.932 --> 27:26.811
Sitting in that cell all alone,
facing a life sentence of solitude,

27:27.312 --> 27:28.605
future full of misery.

27:29.814 --> 27:32.901
Part of you had to know
that wasn't the end of your story.

27:34.444 --> 27:36.488
You were destined for something more.

27:38.073 --> 27:40.575
Destiny didn't get me out of prison,
Captain.

27:42.535 --> 27:43.662
You did that.

27:45.163 --> 27:47.457
Well, let's agree to disagree.

27:47.540 --> 27:48.375
For now.

27:52.337 --> 27:54.297
So, who is this emperor?

27:55.924 --> 27:58.343
There's no information in the rebel files.

27:58.426 --> 28:00.637
Beyond the fact that
the emperor is savage.

28:02.555 --> 28:05.225
Maybe it's not a bad thing
that you and I are ghosts.

28:06.101 --> 28:09.437
I found something curious in the data.
Potential way home.

28:09.979 --> 28:12.273
I didn't know how to exploit it till now. I think you might end up saving us all.

28:16.069 --> 28:18.655
<i>It's a suicide mission.</i>
-No, listen, Commander.

28:18.738 --> 28:20.490
Data from rebel intelligence suggests

28:20.573 --> 28:23.284
we're not the first ship from our universe
to find ourselves here.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.995
It cites another Starfleet vessel.

28:26.079 --> 28:27.414
The <i>U.S.S. Defiant.</i>

28:27.664 --> 28:28.873
How's that possible?

28:28.957 --> 28:32.710
At last review, the <i>Defiant </i>was
patrolling Sector Six in our universe.

28:32.794 --> 28:35.088
There may be a temporal anomaly at play.

28:35.171 --> 28:37.549
It's unclear,
but data suggests that in the future,

28:37.632 --> 28:39.676
<i>Defiant</i> will encounter a phenomenon
that'll bring it

28:39.759 --> 28:42.387
-into this universe's past.
-Regardless,

28:42.470 --> 28:46.266
<i>Defiant </i>is a Constitution-class vessel.
It didn't get here by spore drive.

28:46.975 --> 28:49.102
If we find out how it did make it over,

28:49.811 --> 28:53.356
-could be our way home.
-But boarding the <i>I.S.S. Shenzhou,</i>

28:53.440 --> 28:57.652
posing as your Terran selves?
That plan is an invitation for calamity.

28:57.736 --> 29:01.114
-Captain, I beg you to reconsider.
-Intel on the <i>Defiant</i> is classified.

29:01.197 --> 29:04.743
It's only available on a Terran ship
to those with high-level clearance,

29:04.826 --> 29:05.869
like a captain.

29:05.952 --> 29:09.330
But you are an enemy of the empire
and no longer a captain.

29:09.414 --> 29:10.331
No, but I am.

29:10.415 --> 29:13.251
-I thought the other Burnham was dead.
-Presumed dead.

29:13.334 --> 29:16.379
-My body was never found.
-I'm responsible for her death.

29:16.796 --> 29:19.132
And I'm still at large, so Captain Burnham

29:19.215 --> 29:21.926
will return to the <i>Shenzhou,</i>
with me as bounty.

29:22.010 --> 29:26.181
I'll explain that my death was a cover
to hunt him to the end of the quadrant.

29:26.264 --> 29:27.098
Delightful.

29:27.182 --> 29:28.141
We beam over,

29:28.224 --> 29:31.060
Burnham gets info on <i>Defiant,</i>
we beam back. Simple.

29:31.603 --> 29:34.063
Every captain in the Empire has a guard.

29:34.606 --> 29:36.941
-You're gonna be Burnham's.

29:37.442 --> 29:40.195
Have long-range sensors scan
for the <i>I.S.S. Shenzhou.</i>

29:40.278 --> 29:42.864
When you find her,
plot an intercept course.

29:43.656 --> 29:45.450
Let's get us home.

29:46.201 --> 29:47.035
Yes, sir.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.422
<i>What are you worried about?</i>

29:59.964 --> 30:02.634
Make sure the Klingons didn't do
something to me.

30:02.717 --> 30:04.594
Some procedure I don't know about.

30:05.929 --> 30:08.640
Well, of course... anything is possible.

30:10.141 --> 30:13.061
But you were exposed to a full set
of physical scans

30:13.144 --> 30:14.646
when you came onboard.

30:14.729 --> 30:18.441
And random memory sampling,
the Manchurian test is highly effective

30:18.525 --> 30:21.069
at detecting what used to be called
"brainwashing,"

30:21.152 --> 30:24.197
i.e., the installation of commands
or personality engrams

30:24.280 --> 30:26.407
underneath a functioning consciousness.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.662
What exactly are you imagining
they could've done to you?

30:30.745 --> 30:32.580
I'm not imagining anything.

30:32.664 --> 30:33.998
Forgive me, Lieutenant.

30:34.541 --> 30:37.126
I meant the word practically,
not pejoratively.

30:38.086 --> 30:42.423
As in when one uses the imagination
to picture what is not yet known.

30:43.550 --> 30:44.467
Or seen.

30:45.802 --> 30:49.138
Are you suffering from mood swings?
Fugue states

30:51.099 --> 30:53.142
If any of that is the case,
I'll have to ground you.

30:55.061 --> 30:57.480
I just wanna make sure I'm shipshape
before this mission.

30:58.064 --> 31:01.693
The people on this ship saved my life.
I won't let them down.

31:02.652 --> 31:04.863
Let me run a deeper set of scans.

31:04.946 --> 31:07.574
What you probably need most right now
is rest.

31:07.657 --> 31:10.952
-And some time off of this ship.
-Not much chance of that.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.538
Stay out of the palace!

31:16.207 --> 31:17.500
I'll just be a minute.

31:24.883 --> 31:25.717
Paul...

31:26.718 --> 31:27.969
I'm not going anywhere.

31:29.596 --> 31:31.306
I'm gonna stay right by your side.

31:35.768 --> 31:37.103
It'll be okay.

31:47.780 --> 31:50.074
Be careful. The enemy is here.

31:59.167 --> 32:02.545
I'd say, um... I'm 60 percent excited,

32:02.962 --> 32:04.631
40 percent terrified.

32:05.298 --> 32:08.092
Actually, 60 percent terrified,
40 percent excited.

32:08.718 --> 32:10.303
-Maybe 70 percent--
-Tilly.

32:10.386 --> 32:12.639
-Sorry. Sorry.
-Then stop apologizing.

32:13.389 --> 32:15.058
Terrans don't apologize.

32:25.443 --> 32:27.487
My mother would definitely approve.

32:29.364 --> 32:30.740
Computer, cancel mirror.

32:35.620 --> 32:38.247
-You are a captain now.
-No, I'm not.

32:38.539 --> 32:39.374
She is.

32:40.124 --> 32:42.835
I'm nothing like her.
She's terrifying, she's--

32:42.919 --> 32:46.297
She's like a twisted version
of everything I've aspired to be.

32:46.381 --> 32:49.634
-Gonna have nightmares about myself.
-You don't have to be her.

32:50.426 --> 32:54.305
-I've been trying to understand them.

32:55.264 --> 32:56.516
And Terran strength...

32:57.475 --> 32:59.102
is born out of pure necessity.

32:59.894 --> 33:01.980
Because they live in constant fear.

33:03.564 --> 33:06.734
Always looking for the next knife
aimed at their back.

33:08.695 --> 33:12.073
Their strength is painted rust.
It's a facade.

33:12.532 --> 33:15.785
But you have the strength
of an entire crew that believes in you.

33:16.285 --> 33:18.579
Fortify yourself with our faith in you.

33:20.540 --> 33:22.375
That's what a real captain does.

33:29.966 --> 33:33.511
-Impressive.
-Let's not keep these assholes waiting.

33:35.138 --> 33:35.972
Too much?

33:36.514 --> 33:38.182
No. Not here.

33:38.808 --> 33:40.601
Here, it's just right.

33:48.526 --> 33:49.986
-Mr. Bryce.

33:50.069 --> 33:53.406
-Hail the<i> I.S.S. Shenzhou.</i> Now.
-Aye, Captain.

33:54.615 --> 33:57.577
This is the <i>I.S.S. Discovery</i>
hailing <i>I.S.S. Shenzhou.</i>

33:57.660 --> 33:59.370
<i>Shenzhou, </i>do you read? Over.

34:01.664 --> 34:02.999
Captain Tilly.

34:03.833 --> 34:05.460
To what do I owe the pleasure?

34:06.044 --> 34:07.628
And how can I return the favor?

34:07.712 --> 34:10.048
The only pleasure I take is from
the blood of my enemies

34:10.131 --> 34:12.383
staining my uniform, Captain Connor.

34:15.219 --> 34:16.054
You know him?

34:17.013 --> 34:18.931
He was my ops officer on the <i>Shenzhou.</i>

34:20.558 --> 34:23.227
I watched him die
at the Battle of the Binary Stars.

34:24.145 --> 34:26.314
I knew we'd encounter familiar faces.

34:29.567 --> 34:31.778
But is this what it's gonna be like here?

34:32.111 --> 34:36.157
While scouring the asteroid belts
of Porathia, searching for hidden rebels,

34:36.240 --> 34:38.576
I happened to come across
a disabled shuttle.

34:39.786 --> 34:43.956
Inside, I found something
I think you'll find most interesting.

34:48.920 --> 34:49.921
Showtime.

34:52.673 --> 34:53.633
Captain Burnham.

34:56.677 --> 34:57.887
We thought you were...

34:58.971 --> 35:01.349
You thought what I wanted you
and everyone else to think.

35:02.183 --> 35:03.101
Especially him.

35:03.810 --> 35:06.104
It was the only way
I could capture this traitor.

35:06.896 --> 35:09.732
-Most ingenious.
-I don't need your compliments.

35:10.233 --> 35:11.484
I need my ship.

35:13.319 --> 35:14.362
Of course.

35:14.821 --> 35:17.073
I expect you've kept her
in perfect condition?

35:17.156 --> 35:19.534
-Yes, Captain.
-Then bring her to me.

35:22.036 --> 35:24.789
We have a rebel group pinned down
in this system.

35:24.872 --> 35:26.582
It would be better if you come to us.

35:26.666 --> 35:29.252
Is that how you treat
your long

35:29.335 --> 35:30.837
If you greeted me that way,

35:30.920 --> 35:34.340
I'd cut out your tongue
and use it to lick my boots.

35:37.385 --> 35:40.429
We will alter course to the<i> Discovery</i>
at once, Captain Burnham,

35:40.513 --> 35:43.266
-and prepare for your arrival.
-Be sure that you do.

35:51.566 --> 35:52.525
You called, doc?

35:52.817 --> 35:54.735
-Yeah. Um...

35:55.570 --> 35:57.155
Have you ever received any...

35:57.905 --> 36:01.534
neurological therapies
or marrow diminution procedures before?

36:01.617 --> 36:03.369
No. Not that I know of.

36:03.452 --> 36:07.081
There are masses of scar tissue
surrounding all of your organs.

36:07.456 --> 36:10.877
-Right. From my torture.
-That's what the computer concluded

36:10.960 --> 36:13.045
when you first came aboard, but...

36:13.129 --> 36:15.339
I've run more advanced tests, and...

36:16.549 --> 36:19.510
if I'm reading these chondroblast
cell scans correctly,

36:20.219 --> 36:23.055
what the Klingons did to you
can only be described as...

36:24.682 --> 36:25.892
bone-crushing.

36:26.434 --> 36:28.060
They opened up your limbs.

36:28.853 --> 36:31.272
They appear to have shortened your radius,

36:31.355 --> 36:34.775
-your femurs, even your spinal cord.

36:34.859 --> 36:38.362
Well, this is just a theory, Tyler,
but remember we confirmed

36:38.446 --> 36:42.116
that no personality engrams were hidden
under your native identity?

36:43.034 --> 36:44.243
-Okay.
-Well...

36:44.785 --> 36:48.497
there's some research that suggests
a new personality could be placed...

36:49.707 --> 36:51.500
atop it, like an overlay,

36:51.584 --> 36:55.171
with the original personality
still intact underneath.

36:56.547 --> 36:58.758
It appears that the Klingons
have transformed you.

37:00.051 --> 37:02.303
-Both mentally and physically.

37:04.222 --> 37:06.974
-That's what we have to figure out.
-I came for a solution.

37:07.058 --> 37:08.643
-You said you could fix it.
-Sit.

37:08.726 --> 37:11.771
-I'm needed on a mission.
-Not without further examination.

37:11.854 --> 37:13.773
-They need me!
-That's just it.

37:13.856 --> 37:15.399
As far as I'm concerned...

37:16.400 --> 37:17.526
you're not you.

37:20.780 --> 37:22.073
The enemy is here.

37:34.210 --> 37:36.212
-Incoming warp signature.

37:37.088 --> 37:38.839
<i>I.S.S. Shenzhou </i>approaching.

37:41.842 --> 37:43.386
My God.

37:44.762 --> 37:46.264
We're being hailed.

37:51.185 --> 37:52.436
Open a channel.

37:52.520 --> 37:55.314
Inform <i>Shenzhou,</i> three to beam over.

37:55.398 --> 37:56.357
Aye, sir.

38:04.699 --> 38:07.410
Look after her, Mr. Saru.
You're in charge now.

38:07.994 --> 38:11.831
Well, I guess you're in charge
to anybody off the ship, Captain Killy.

38:13.708 --> 38:17.128
Maintain a safe distance,
close enough to transport us back

38:17.211 --> 38:19.463
as soon as Burnham gets the <i>Defiant </i>files.

38:20.006 --> 38:22.633
-I won't let you down, sir.
-I know you won't.

38:23.009 --> 38:24.927
Tyler, where were you?

38:25.469 --> 38:26.304
I...

38:27.263 --> 38:29.765
-I'm not sure, sir.

38:31.600 --> 38:34.562
There's no excuse for my tardiness.
Sorry, Captain.

38:37.606 --> 38:38.774
No more apologies.

38:39.692 --> 38:42.111
From now on, we're Terrans.

38:42.611 --> 38:45.156
Decency is weakness, will get us killed.

38:46.615 --> 38:50.286
The lives of everyone on this ship
and the Federation are at stake.

38:50.828 --> 38:52.121
You do what you must.

38:52.955 --> 38:54.165
Whatever you must.

38:55.041 --> 38:55.875
To anyone.

38:56.417 --> 38:57.293
Understand?

38:57.793 --> 38:59.170
-Aye, Captain.
-Clear, Captain.

39:00.004 --> 39:01.672
Last time you call me captain.

39:03.382 --> 39:04.925
Hopefully just for a while.

39:07.386 --> 39:08.220
Ready?

39:13.309 --> 39:14.310
Energize.

39:20.191 --> 39:21.317
Captain Burnham.

39:23.736 --> 39:25.071
Welcome back to the <i>Shenzhou.</i>

39:26.989 --> 39:28.574
We made modifications.

39:28.657 --> 39:30.993
Replaced lateral-vector transport systems.

39:34.705 --> 39:37.583
Let me take this bastard.
He's due for a world of pain.

39:38.125 --> 39:40.211
-Keep your hands off him.

39:45.800 --> 39:49.345
Think I'd let anyone control the fate
of the most valuable bounty in the galaxy?

39:56.477 --> 39:58.646
I'll take Lorca to the brig personally.

39:59.188 --> 40:00.773
There are any number of souls onboard

40:00.856 --> 40:03.734
looking to serve up his severed head
for their own glory.

40:04.568 --> 40:07.321
Of course. I'll escort you, Captain.

40:25.965 --> 40:30.469
Only the finest agonizer booth
reserved for the treacherous Lorca.

40:30.970 --> 40:32.221
Absolutely not.

40:34.557 --> 40:35.558
Captain?

40:37.268 --> 40:38.769
What did I say to you?

40:39.645 --> 40:41.689
I do not want some overzealous guard

40:41.772 --> 40:44.400
killing this traitor
before I have the chance.

40:44.942 --> 40:47.987
I would punish the entire ship
for an error that grave.

40:48.070 --> 40:50.906
We would never allow him
the release of death.

40:52.491 --> 40:56.745
See to it
that he is installed properly here.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.295
I need to access my files.
Escort me to the ready room.

41:18.058 --> 41:21.103
I almost didn't make it to captain
after you were gone.

41:21.812 --> 41:23.439
But I still came out on top.

41:25.274 --> 41:27.151
The emperor saw something in me.

41:28.235 --> 41:29.320
Glad to hear it. The crew...

41:34.241 --> 41:35.743
they all bowed after I won.

41:38.078 --> 41:40.080
But they didn't bow deeply enough.

41:41.874 --> 41:43.375
Not like they did with you.

41:44.752 --> 41:46.504
I needed to make them fear me.

41:48.422 --> 41:50.257
Now I finally think I know how.

42:02.019 --> 42:04.104
I don't need a blade to kill you.

43:22.474 --> 43:24.184
The chair is yours, Captain.

43:24.685 --> 43:25.728
Dispose of him.

43:26.478 --> 43:28.814
With pleasure, sir.  Long live Captain Burnham!

43:42.828 --> 43:45.039
Long live the Empire!

43:45.664 --> 43:47.416
Long live the Empire.

44:23.786 --> 44:25.120
Scared the hell out of me.

44:27.623 --> 44:29.833
-Access code's the same<i>.</i>

44:31.335 --> 44:35.214
Head of security, I know all of them.
It's not just yours.

44:37.299 --> 44:38.717
You get into the files?

44:39.802 --> 44:42.429


44:43.847 --> 44:45.015
No chance.

44:46.934 --> 44:48.352
Everybody on the crew...

44:49.770 --> 44:51.230
they're trailing me.

44:53.023 --> 44:55.609
Trying to sidle up, curry favor.

44:57.945 --> 44:59.613
I didn't wanna rouse suspicion.

45:09.248 --> 45:10.791
I heard about what happened.

45:12.668 --> 45:13.752
With Connor.

45:16.171 --> 45:17.881
I need to tell you something.

45:19.007 --> 45:20.259
Whatever you do...

45:21.677 --> 45:23.595
whatever this place makes you do...

45:24.847 --> 45:26.181
whatever happens to you...

45:28.183 --> 45:29.017
or me...

45:31.019 --> 45:32.396
however we change...

45:35.858 --> 45:37.443
I'm here to protect you.

45:39.528 --> 45:41.697
Nothing will ever stand
in the way of that.

45:43.741 --> 45:44.742
Nothing.

45:47.119 --> 45:48.829
You understand what I'm saying?

45:52.708 --> 45:53.625
Yes.

46:28.035 --> 46:29.328
I'm saying it back.
