WEBVTT

00:05.163 --> 00:06.530
Hey I know you guys
have been talking

00:06.596 --> 00:07.864
to a lot of other agencies,

00:07.932 --> 00:09.412
but I don't think there's
a better fit

00:09.467 --> 00:10.627
than Lewis, Roberts & Roberts

00:10.668 --> 00:12.269
and the Australian
Tourist Board.

00:12.336 --> 00:13.937
Oh, we hope so, mate,
because we're desperate

00:14.004 --> 00:15.705
to get more tourists
back down to Oz.

00:15.773 --> 00:16.706
What's stopping them?

00:16.774 --> 00:18.041
The 23-hour flight?

00:18.109 --> 00:19.909
Hey, I've had binges
longer than that!

00:21.978 --> 00:24.213
Well, you're speaking
my language now, mate.

00:24.281 --> 00:25.581
So we'll be ready

00:25.648 --> 00:27.683
to pitch to you Wednesday
at 6:00 p.m.

00:27.750 --> 00:28.884
That's Thursday
at 9:00 for you.

00:28.952 --> 00:30.786
Which is the day
after yesterday down there.

00:30.853 --> 00:32.921
I thought that they were
two weeks in the future.

00:32.989 --> 00:34.390
Hey, can you tell me
if the Bulls win tomorrow?

00:34.458 --> 00:35.791
Because I bet my condo
on that game.

00:35.858 --> 00:36.858
Did you hear them?

00:36.926 --> 00:38.293
That's hilarious!

00:38.360 --> 00:39.927
Don't you worry, we'll make it
hilarious for you.

00:39.995 --> 00:41.096
You take care.

00:41.163 --> 00:42.230
G'day!

00:42.298 --> 00:43.898
Oh, God, do I hate them.

00:43.966 --> 00:45.900
So smug in their board shorts.

00:45.968 --> 00:47.302
You could only see them
from the waist up.

00:47.369 --> 00:49.304
Yeah, but I could feel them,
and I hate them as much

00:49.371 --> 00:50.771
as I hate their stupid country.

00:50.839 --> 00:53.040
And that accent... oh, it's
like sandpaper on your ears.

00:53.108 --> 00:54.108
G'day, mate!

00:54.175 --> 00:55.409
No worries.

00:55.477 --> 00:56.676
Put another shrimp
on the barbie.

00:56.744 --> 00:58.312
Sheila, this is Bruce.
Bruce, this is Sheila.

00:59.547 --> 01:00.547
People love that accent.

01:00.615 --> 01:01.582
What's not to love
about Australia?

01:01.649 --> 01:02.889
It's supposed to be a paradise.

01:02.917 --> 01:05.084
Paradise? They're an
overgrown penal colony!

01:05.153 --> 01:06.920
Two-dollar coin's smaller
than the one-dollar coin.

01:06.988 --> 01:09.522
Every single animal down there
can kill you.

01:09.590 --> 01:11.224
And it takes forever
to dry your hair.

01:11.291 --> 01:12.658
Simon, God knows
if you're hating on something,

01:12.726 --> 01:13.726
we want to be right there
with you.

01:13.793 --> 01:14.893
Got it.
Okay?

01:14.961 --> 01:17.130
But they gave us Naomi Watts.

01:17.197 --> 01:18.197
But they also gave us
<i>The Wiggles,</i>

01:18.265 --> 01:19.532
which are only enjoyable
if you're high.

01:19.600 --> 01:21.240
And what kind of message
is that for kids?

01:25.071 --> 01:26.838
Hey, Simon.

01:26.905 --> 01:28.373
What happened in there?

01:28.441 --> 01:29.608
You want to talk about it?

01:29.675 --> 01:32.410
I've only been
to Australia once.

01:32.478 --> 01:34.379
But it was a doozy.

01:34.447 --> 01:36.615
It was my last big bender.

01:36.682 --> 01:38.250
When I really hit bottom.

01:38.317 --> 01:39.384
I don't remember much.

01:39.452 --> 01:41.052
Started off as a drinkabout

01:41.120 --> 01:42.386
with these rugby players.

01:42.454 --> 01:44.094
Next thing you know,
I woke up in a Speedo

01:44.122 --> 01:46.423
on a beach in Perth
being pulled into the bush

01:46.491 --> 01:48.292
by an eastern grey kangaroo.

01:48.360 --> 01:50.060
An Aboriginal woman
fought him off.

01:50.128 --> 01:52.763
And then I was with her
for a while, and...

01:52.830 --> 01:54.765
There's more,
but I don't want to bore you.

01:56.434 --> 01:58.601

- Yup.
- How is it?

02:19.322 --> 02:21.056
I haven't read it yet.
I was waiting for an audience.

02:21.123 --> 02:22.558
"The newest partner

02:36.938 --> 02:38.806
- But this is so wrong.
- Yeah, that's just bad writing.

02:38.873 --> 02:39.907
"Aloof" and "standoffish"
are synonyms.

02:39.974 --> 02:41.375
- You don't need both.
- Yeah, he must have

02:41.443 --> 02:43.411
really wanted to make a point
about how cold you are.

02:43.478 --> 02:46.246
- Oh, that makes sense.
- Sydney, someone sent you a basket.

02:46.314 --> 02:47.880
- What do we got? What do we got?
- Ooh, dibs on any sensual body oils.

02:47.948 --> 02:49.482
Andrew, you can have
cured meats.

02:49.550 --> 02:51.870
- I'm good with that.

- Ooh, chocolate truffles.
- My hand was already on that!

02:59.793 --> 03:00.893
I have a better metabolism.

03:00.961 --> 03:02.728
You yo-yo. Am I wrong?

03:02.795 --> 03:03.895
Who's Danny?

03:03.963 --> 03:05.197
Uh, he was this sweet

03:05.265 --> 03:06.798
but kind of nerdy jingle writer

03:06.866 --> 03:08.234
at the first agency
I worked at.

03:08.301 --> 03:11.303
He got fired for pushing
this jingle for Calamine lotion.

03:11.371 --> 03:13.305
Yeah, "Ration Ain't
the Fashion."

03:14.374 --> 03:15.541
He took it pretty hard.

03:15.609 --> 03:18.476
It's okay. Really it's okay.

03:18.544 --> 03:20.211
Women can just
drink more Cosmos.

03:20.279 --> 03:21.679
No one knows why.

03:21.747 --> 03:23.881
If I can't write jingles...

03:23.949 --> 03:26.884
what am I gonna do?

03:26.952 --> 03:28.353
It was sweet of him
to think of me.

03:28.420 --> 03:29.887
Looks like he's thought
of you a lot.

03:29.955 --> 03:33.124
Wh... why is my
picture on the cover of a CD?

03:33.191 --> 03:35.032
More important, what's
with the '80s hairstyle?

03:35.092 --> 03:36.025
Oh, I get it.

03:36.093 --> 03:37.060
Your picture's on it

03:37.128 --> 03:38.629
'cause he wrote
you a love song.

It's kind of his job.

04:22.604 --> 04:24.471
Murder beats,
not people, Danny.

04:24.539 --> 04:26.106
Okay, this is too weird.

04:26.174 --> 04:28.694
- How did he even know about the article?
- Probably a Google Alert.

04:28.743 --> 04:30.344
- Happened to me a few times.
- I've done that a few times.

04:30.412 --> 04:32.045
Why this picture?

04:32.113 --> 04:33.380
Why didn't he just use one
from the camera

04:33.448 --> 04:34.881
he has hidden in her bathroom?

04:34.949 --> 04:36.383
Sydney's the girl who got away.

04:36.451 --> 04:38.351
I'm more concerned about the
girls that didn't get away.

04:38.419 --> 04:39.519
What are you doing?

04:39.586 --> 04:40.786
Well, I have to say thank you.

04:40.821 --> 04:42.689
So I figured,
if I do it through Facebook,

04:42.756 --> 04:44.056
then I don't have
to give him my e-mail address.

04:44.124 --> 04:45.291
Syd, I don't think
that's a good idea.

04:45.359 --> 04:47.193
I say always ignore a stalker.

04:47.260 --> 04:49.796
- He's right, I eventually stop.
- He's right, they eventually stop.

04:49.863 --> 04:51.497
I'm not going to ignore him.
That would be...

04:51.565 --> 04:52.699
- Aloof?
- Standoffish?

04:52.766 --> 04:54.900
Not who I am.

04:54.968 --> 04:57.303
There. It's over.

04:57.370 --> 04:59.138
Sydney's on the phone
with Danny. He called her!

04:59.206 --> 05:01.640
Oh, yeah, no,
I-I like the song.

05:01.708 --> 05:03.642
It's very catchy.

05:03.710 --> 05:05.277
- Put him on speaker, put him on speaker!
- I don't...

05:05.345 --> 05:06.511
I'm so glad. You know, I was...

05:06.579 --> 05:08.113
I was a little nervous.

05:08.181 --> 05:09.315
- Is that her?
- Yeah.

05:09.382 --> 05:11.316
They're always nervous
before their first kill.

05:11.383 --> 05:13.684
You're listening to it, cool.

05:14.887 --> 05:16.254
She's listening to it.

05:16.322 --> 05:18.289
So, hey, my first CD's
coming out.

05:18.357 --> 05:20.691
You should totally come
to my release party on Friday.

05:20.759 --> 05:21.792
I'm pretty sure
you've been to all

05:21.861 --> 05:22.793
- of his "release parties."
- Shut up!

05:22.862 --> 05:23.794
- What?
- Uh, nothing.

05:23.863 --> 05:25.296
I mean, you have to be there.

05:25.364 --> 05:26.864
You're kind of
the inspiration for it all.

05:26.931 --> 05:27.965
Aw...

05:28.032 --> 05:29.532
That's so nice.

05:29.600 --> 05:31.168

05:35.406 --> 05:36.974
- and Dolls.
- Nice save.

05:37.041 --> 05:38.375
Yeah, well, I know
what the problem is.

05:38.442 --> 05:40.443
I know it's-it's-it's
last minute, but, um...

05:40.511 --> 05:41.711
Hey, maybe we could grab

05:41.779 --> 05:43.279
a cup of coffee
or something sometime?

05:44.114 --> 05:45.348
Sure, we should totally

05:45.415 --> 05:46.382
do that sometime.

05:46.449 --> 05:47.850
She said yes.

05:47.918 --> 05:49.218
She's free this after...

05:49.286 --> 05:50.719
Uh, you know, I think they're
calling me for something

05:50.787 --> 05:52.889
for work, so I have to run,
but it was great talking to you.

05:52.956 --> 05:53.923
Okay, bye.

05:53.991 --> 05:55.391
You're gonna have coffee
with him?

05:55.458 --> 05:56.692
God, no! I want my last meal

05:56.760 --> 05:58.059
to be something
more than coffee.

Almost makes you forget

a clever campaign.

06:41.601 --> 06:43.169
Well, just dumb it
down a bit, mate.

06:43.237 --> 06:45.438
Yeah, dumb is good.
I like dumb.

06:45.505 --> 06:48.373

for "stop calling"?

07:16.301 --> 07:18.734
But to a stalker,
ignoring is a kind of foreplay.

07:18.802 --> 07:22.105
Like the smell of the leaves
outside his bathroom window.

07:22.173 --> 07:25.842
Or the feel of his T-shirt
you stole from his laundry room.

07:25.909 --> 07:27.310
Or the....

07:28.579 --> 07:30.780
Wait, I'm sensing your question
was rhetorical.

07:30.848 --> 07:31.914
Sorry.

07:31.983 --> 07:34.183
Can't do it, Syd.

07:34.250 --> 07:35.250
They hate everything.

07:35.318 --> 07:36.718
I'm ready to pitch them
the truth.

07:36.786 --> 07:38.954
"Australia: So Hot, Not Even
the Nazis Wanted It!"

07:39.022 --> 07:40.990
Dad, please, come on...
we want this!

07:41.057 --> 07:43.158
How many agencies do you know
that have an entire country?

07:43.226 --> 07:44.793
Hell, a continent.

07:44.861 --> 07:46.828
Should they even be allowed
to call themselves a continent?

07:46.896 --> 07:49.164
I think we should revisit that
like we did with Pluto.

07:49.232 --> 07:50.164
This is really important.

07:50.232 --> 07:51.632
They want us
to lower our standards.

07:51.700 --> 07:54.402
I once caught you drinking
my nail polish remover.

07:54.470 --> 07:55.503
- I remember.
- Please.

07:55.570 --> 07:57.005
Do whatever it takes
to land them.

07:57.072 --> 07:58.106
Please!

07:58.173 --> 08:00.375
I'll do it.

Wait! You're in a meeting.

09:14.580 --> 09:15.547
No, I'm not.

09:15.614 --> 09:16.781
I'm going to go pee.

09:16.849 --> 09:17.782
Danny's here.

09:17.850 --> 09:19.350
What?

09:19.418 --> 09:21.185
Sydney! Hey, you.

09:21.253 --> 09:23.120
- Hey!
- Hey!

09:23.188 --> 09:26.057
Wow, you haven't changed at all.

09:26.124 --> 09:28.204
I mean, your hair is longer
and your face is older...

09:28.259 --> 09:30.494
I... didn't mean that.

09:30.562 --> 09:33.063
I check her whereabouts
every ten minutes.

09:33.130 --> 09:34.665
- Okay.
- Um...

09:34.732 --> 09:36.667
- Wh-What are you doing here?
- You know...

09:36.734 --> 09:38.335
we were looking
for a time to hang out,

09:38.402 --> 09:39.837
and you're so busy
that I just figured,

09:39.904 --> 09:41.538
you know...
bitch got to eat.

09:42.606 --> 09:44.440
I didn't mean that, either.

09:44.508 --> 09:46.408
Uh, I brought lunch.

09:46.477 --> 09:47.376
Egg salad.

09:47.444 --> 09:48.478
But not on a hard roll,

09:48.545 --> 09:50.379
because I remember
that you hate it

09:50.447 --> 09:52.582
when egg salad smushes
all out the outside

09:52.649 --> 09:54.183
because when you take
a bite, it...

09:54.250 --> 09:55.384
Danny, stop, please, stop!

09:55.452 --> 09:56.819
Okay? Th-This is weird, really.

09:56.887 --> 09:58.087
It-it's too weird.

09:58.154 --> 10:00.321
I... The egg salad
and the song...

10:00.389 --> 10:01.823
You don't like the song?

10:01.891 --> 10:03.925
It's insane!
I-I just... I don't understand

10:03.993 --> 10:05.594
why you would write
that song about me.

10:05.661 --> 10:07.261
I mean, we barely
know each other.

10:07.329 --> 10:09.330
Okay.

10:09.398 --> 10:10.499
Well...

10:10.566 --> 10:13.768
I just, I-I thought
that maybe, uh...

10:13.836 --> 10:14.768
You know what?

10:14.836 --> 10:16.269
Forget it. You're right.

10:16.337 --> 10:17.705
We barely know each other.

10:17.772 --> 10:19.607
Maybe you're just, um...

10:19.641 --> 10:22.743
not the same Sydney
that I remember.

10:26.948 --> 10:29.249
Well, I don't have
to pee anymore.

10:29.317 --> 10:32.251
I always wonder where it
goes when that happens.

10:32.319 --> 10:33.753
Well, that's it, fellas.

10:33.821 --> 10:35.087
That's our last pitch.

10:35.155 --> 10:36.088
"Australia.
We Got Penguins."

10:36.156 --> 10:37.089
What do you think?

10:38.225 --> 10:39.225
As if I give a rat's ass

10:39.292 --> 10:40.426
what they think,
I hate them so much.

10:40.494 --> 10:42.161
Gentlemen?

10:42.229 --> 10:43.530
Well, to be honest,

10:43.597 --> 10:44.931
we don't really love it.

10:44.999 --> 10:45.999
Oh, what a surprise.

10:46.066 --> 10:46.999
That's why I hate Australians.

10:47.066 --> 10:48.333
They never say what they mean.

10:48.401 --> 10:49.868
I think they did.
They said they don't love it.

10:49.936 --> 10:51.837
So I hate them
and their directness.

10:51.905 --> 10:54.339
What we need is an
"I Heart New York."

10:54.407 --> 10:55.774
Yeah.

10:55.842 --> 10:57.075
Now, what about...

10:57.143 --> 10:59.044
"I Heart Australia"?

10:59.111 --> 11:00.879
What about "I hate Australia"?

11:00.947 --> 11:01.880
What was that?

11:01.948 --> 11:02.980
You didn't mute it.

11:03.048 --> 11:04.114
No, I didn't, did I?

11:04.182 --> 11:05.683
How can anyone
hate Australia, mate?

11:05.751 --> 11:07.217
- No, no, no. See...
- He has that disease...

11:07.285 --> 11:08.786
- He... he loves Australia... 
- Where he says the opposite thing...

11:08.854 --> 11:11.188
You didn't let me finish.
I said "I hate Australia"

11:11.256 --> 11:13.123
- because I think about it all the time!
- He's obsessed.

11:13.191 --> 11:15.359
- I can't go there often, because it's so far.
- It's really far.

11:15.427 --> 11:16.694
Sure, there's other places
I could go that are closer,

11:16.762 --> 11:18.429
- but it's not the same.
- No.

11:18.496 --> 11:20.797
-  Why was I saying I hate that?
- You were saying, "Uh, Hawaii, sure",

11:20.865 --> 11:22.666
"you're cute, but you're no Australia." You
were saying that it's like nowhere else.

11:22.733 --> 11:24.067
That's it!
That's exactly

11:24.134 --> 11:25.535
what we're going for.

11:25.603 --> 11:28.738
Australia, you're like
nowhere else.

11:28.806 --> 11:29.906
Australia, you're
worth the trip

11:29.974 --> 11:31.207
because you're one of a kind!

How could this happen?

12:11.946 --> 12:13.714
Your dad just
started singing it.

12:13.781 --> 12:14.715
Well, you jumped
right in with the guitar.

12:14.782 --> 12:15.782
Guys, guys...

12:15.850 --> 12:16.717
the important thing
to remember here

12:16.784 --> 12:18.051
is I am mostly free of blame.

12:18.119 --> 12:20.053
Except all of you have been
playing it all week!

12:20.121 --> 12:22.188
Well, in my defense,
it's pretty darn catchy.

12:22.256 --> 12:23.896
And really good to start
your cool-down to

12:23.924 --> 12:24.857
after a tough workout.

12:24.925 --> 12:26.626
Not that I have.

12:26.693 --> 12:28.060
- I was just singing backup vocals.
- Doesn't matter.

12:28.128 --> 12:29.061
You're gonna have to find
something else

12:29.129 --> 12:30.062
to pitch to the Australians.

12:30.130 --> 12:31.230
There's nothing left to pitch.

12:31.297 --> 12:32.965
I jumped genders for them!

12:33.033 --> 12:34.299
We'll just buy the rights
from your friend.

12:34.367 --> 12:35.300
Oh...

12:35.368 --> 12:37.069
What "oh..."?

12:37.137 --> 12:39.203
I may have been
a little rude to him.

12:39.271 --> 12:40.511
It was the ugliest
thing I've ever seen.

12:41.030 --> 12:43.498
And I spent a summer interning
with Japanese whalers.

12:43.499 --> 12:44.676
- Sounds horrible.
- Tell me about it.

12:44.677 --> 12:46.277
None of the credits transferred.

12:46.345 --> 12:47.545
Okay, here's the plan.
Okay.

12:47.613 --> 12:49.213
Danny is going to be
at the launch party tonight.

12:49.281 --> 12:50.682
He goes on
at 9:00 sharp.

12:50.750 --> 12:52.550
You could get there a little
early, I'll go with you...

12:52.618 --> 12:54.385
How do you know all that?

12:54.453 --> 12:55.919
Oh, I-I looked at his Web site.

12:55.987 --> 12:57.988
- You know, as a goof.
- It's a good idea.

12:58.056 --> 12:59.417
You go there, you...
bump into him.

12:59.457 --> 13:01.525
You want me to go crawling back
to my obsessed stalker,

13:01.592 --> 13:03.127
whom I just left in tears
after telling him

13:03.194 --> 13:04.427
to get out of my life forever,

13:04.495 --> 13:05.663
and ask him to sell us
his song?

13:05.730 --> 13:06.930
That's a better idea.

13:06.998 --> 13:08.678
What I was thinking
was way more demeaning.

13:09.901 --> 13:11.433
Yeah.

13:17.979 --> 13:19.847
<i>I'll be fine.</i>

13:19.915 --> 13:21.875
Danny's gonna realize that
there can't be anything

13:21.917 --> 13:23.951
between us once he meets
my boyfriend Andrew.

13:24.019 --> 13:26.287
Mmm. Where is my
boyfriend Andrew?

13:26.355 --> 13:27.689
I was in a band in college.

13:27.756 --> 13:28.788
Did you ever hear of.

13:28.856 --> 13:30.357
- Pungent Stench?
- No.

13:30.425 --> 13:32.292
We opened for them.

13:32.360 --> 13:33.960
Hey, guys.
What's the plan?

13:34.028 --> 13:35.629
What you got there?

13:35.697 --> 13:37.231
"Danny Chase,
Fall '13."

13:37.298 --> 13:39.633
Uh, yeah, I-I stopped
by the, uh, the merch table.

13:39.701 --> 13:41.602
As a goof.

13:41.669 --> 13:44.737
And, uh, I picked up that CD
as a... as a further goof.

13:44.804 --> 13:45.771
Hey, Danny, good luck.

13:45.839 --> 13:47.673
- Here's Danny.
- What? Where? Where?

13:47.741 --> 13:49.508
Oh, my God, be cool.
Be cool!

13:49.576 --> 13:50.776
Hey.

13:50.844 --> 13:52.010
Hello, Sydney.

13:53.347 --> 13:54.913
- Excuse me.
- Wait, wait, hold on.

13:54.981 --> 13:56.415
I-I, um...

13:56.483 --> 13:59.184
I really want to apologize
for what I said.

13:59.253 --> 14:00.518
You know, sometimes my emotions

14:00.586 --> 14:01.853
get the best of me.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.521
- It's because of how she was raised.
- Dad...

14:03.556 --> 14:05.089
I take full responsibility.

14:05.157 --> 14:07.158
I married a real bitch
who set a poor example.

14:07.226 --> 14:09.861
Really, I was honored
that you thought so much of me

14:09.928 --> 14:11.229
to write that song.

14:11.297 --> 14:12.897
And so is my boyfriend, Andrew.

14:14.600 --> 14:15.833
We opened for them.

14:15.901 --> 14:17.768
The point is,
we love the song so much,

14:17.835 --> 14:19.069
we'd like to buy it
for a commercial.

14:19.137 --> 14:20.271
And have you sign some
of our T-shirts, Danny.

14:20.338 --> 14:21.605
Sweetheart, not now.

14:21.673 --> 14:23.073
Why would I do
anything for you?

14:23.141 --> 14:24.675
We "barely know"
each other, right?

14:24.743 --> 14:26.623
I never should've said that.
We worked together.

14:26.645 --> 14:28.111
Look, I was a mess
when I lost that job.

14:28.179 --> 14:29.780
And you were the first
person to tell me

14:29.847 --> 14:31.448
that there was more
out there than jingles.

14:31.516 --> 14:33.149
I was the first?
Yeah.

14:33.216 --> 14:34.484
You told me to write
from my heart.

14:34.551 --> 14:36.486
And it changed my life.

14:36.553 --> 14:38.621
So that "weird" song
was my thank-you to you.

14:38.689 --> 14:39.922
But it doesn't matter,

14:39.990 --> 14:41.824
because it didn't mean
anything to you anyway, so...

14:41.892 --> 14:44.126
Maybe you'll like
my new song better.

14:48.265 --> 14:50.532
This is a song
about somebody that I...

14:50.600 --> 14:52.967
I thought I knew.

14:56.339 --> 14:58.440

Hey, great show, man.

16:17.749 --> 16:20.384
I hope that's pee
and not blood.

16:20.451 --> 16:22.018
Why didn't I hope for water?

16:22.086 --> 16:23.520
What do you want?

16:23.588 --> 16:25.988
I want to tell you how much
I loved that last song.

16:26.055 --> 16:27.423
Sure, it didn't paint
the nicest picture

16:27.491 --> 16:29.191
of my daughter,
but still pretty solid.

16:29.259 --> 16:30.225
So much better than

16:30.293 --> 16:31.654
that silly love song
you wrote her.

16:31.661 --> 16:32.795
You mean the, uh...

16:32.863 --> 16:34.597
the silly song
that you came here to buy?

16:34.664 --> 16:36.532
Busted. Yep.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.768
Danny, can I be
honest with you?

16:38.835 --> 16:40.269
It's just the two
of us in here.

16:40.336 --> 16:41.536
And me. Roland.

16:41.604 --> 16:42.670
And Roland.

16:42.738 --> 16:44.299
Between the three of us,
for one second,

16:44.339 --> 16:45.940
can we look at it from
her point of view?

16:45.974 --> 16:47.108
You scared her.

16:47.175 --> 16:48.777
She threw up her walls.

16:48.844 --> 16:50.612
She rejected you, and then
she broke your heart.

16:50.679 --> 16:52.280
But that...

16:52.347 --> 16:53.548
that's when it happened.

16:53.616 --> 16:55.249
When what happened?

16:55.317 --> 16:56.750
You became an artist.

16:56.818 --> 16:58.685
That love song you wrote
is a great jingle,

16:58.753 --> 17:00.621
but that's all I'll ever be.

17:00.688 --> 17:02.656
But that angry jam
that Sydney inspired...

17:02.724 --> 17:04.525
that's rich with
rage and darkness.

17:04.592 --> 17:06.393
That's art.

17:06.461 --> 17:07.728
Stop kissing my ass.

17:07.796 --> 17:08.994
You are
laying it on thick.

17:09.063 --> 17:10.297
How long you gonna
be in there, Roland?

17:10.364 --> 17:12.165
Hey, I'm an artist, too.

17:12.233 --> 17:13.314
I'm just saying great songs

17:13.333 --> 17:14.467
don't come from
getting the girl.

17:14.535 --> 17:15.801
They come from
not getting the girl.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.337
Sydney is like the guy
who broke Adele's heart.

17:18.405 --> 17:19.906
Or the mountain goat who
broke Neil Young's heart.

17:19.973 --> 17:21.674
I know how Neil feels.

17:23.143 --> 17:24.676
Neil feels, Neil feels...
that actually rhymes.

17:24.744 --> 17:25.811
I'm gonna write that down.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.680
You see?
It's working already.

17:27.748 --> 17:28.880
So, what?

17:28.948 --> 17:30.916
You're-you're saying
that I-I need Sydney?

17:30.983 --> 17:32.383
I'm just saying we both can use

17:32.452 --> 17:33.718
this situation
to our advantage.

17:35.154 --> 17:36.254
Wait.
What did we agree to?

17:36.322 --> 17:37.489
Well, Danny will
give us his song

17:37.557 --> 17:38.857
for a reasonable price

17:38.925 --> 17:40.391
in exchange for you
occasionally blowing him off.

17:40.460 --> 17:41.960
"Off." Whew.

17:42.027 --> 17:43.294
I thought that was going
in another direction.

17:43.362 --> 17:44.728
And if Danny's ever blocked,

17:44.796 --> 17:46.730
you have to find some way of,
you know, disappointing him.

17:46.798 --> 17:48.231
Yeah, Syd, you can just
give him attitude

17:48.299 --> 17:49.259
or not return his calls.

17:49.300 --> 17:50.334
This is right in
your wheelhouse.

17:50.401 --> 17:51.936
And that will inspire him.

17:52.003 --> 17:52.937
It's genius!

17:53.004 --> 17:54.505
Does anyone else
think this is weird?

17:54.573 --> 17:55.606
Well, Roland had
some misgivings,

17:55.674 --> 17:57.074
but I think he's on board now.

17:57.141 --> 17:58.075
Sydney, come on.

17:58.142 --> 17:59.109
It's the best of all worlds.

17:59.177 --> 18:00.143
There's no losers.

18:00.211 --> 18:02.445
I don't know.

18:02.513 --> 18:03.880
Syd?

18:03.948 --> 18:06.015
Hey.

18:06.083 --> 18:07.684
- You did nothing wrong.
- How could I forget

18:07.685 --> 18:09.118
that I was part of

18:09.186 --> 18:11.554
the biggest moment
in someone's life?

18:11.622 --> 18:13.055
You know, maybe
Ad Age is right.

18:13.123 --> 18:14.357
Maybe I am cold.

18:14.424 --> 18:15.391
Come on.

18:15.459 --> 18:17.325
So you put up walls.
We all do.

18:17.393 --> 18:18.827
They don't know the real you.

18:18.895 --> 18:21.630
The kind Sydney
that we all know.

18:21.698 --> 18:24.099
Tonight didn't make me
feel so kind.

18:24.166 --> 18:26.101
Do you remember the night

18:26.168 --> 18:27.703
I got back from Australia?

18:27.770 --> 18:28.704
God, I hate that country...

18:28.771 --> 18:30.539
Dad.
Okay.

18:30.607 --> 18:32.807
That trip cost me
everything I cared about:

18:32.875 --> 18:35.977
my wife, my home...

18:36.044 --> 18:37.311
everything except you.

18:37.379 --> 18:39.013
You planned a big

18:39.080 --> 18:40.515
birthday party
for me that night.

18:40.582 --> 18:42.082
Do you know how I repaid you?

18:42.150 --> 18:45.152
I think a T-shirt that said
"Wish You Were Beer."

18:45.220 --> 18:47.087
I came home at 2:00
in the morning

18:47.155 --> 18:48.588
blitzed out of my mind.

18:48.656 --> 18:50.423
Party was long over,
you were asleep.

18:50.491 --> 18:51.925
I was afraid you'd be mad.

18:51.993 --> 18:53.493
You slept on
my couch that night.

18:53.561 --> 18:55.662
Do you remember what
you did the next morning?

18:55.730 --> 18:57.831
No...

19:07.206 --> 19:08.273
<i>No judgment.</i>

19:08.341 --> 19:10.175
<i>Just a simple gesture of love.</i>

19:10.243 --> 19:11.844
<i>Cake.</i>

19:11.912 --> 19:13.846
Because of that,

19:13.914 --> 19:15.014
because of you,

19:15.081 --> 19:17.850
I never had another drink.

19:17.918 --> 19:20.686
So, you see, your kindness
changed my life, too.

19:20.754 --> 19:22.987
I never knew that.

19:27.760 --> 19:29.861
Exactly.

19:31.764 --> 19:33.231
Okay. You coming?

19:33.299 --> 19:34.366
No, you go along.

19:34.434 --> 19:35.434
I've got a little business

19:35.468 --> 19:36.401
I have to discuss with Danny.

19:36.469 --> 19:38.001
