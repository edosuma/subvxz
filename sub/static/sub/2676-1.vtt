05:55.605 --> 05:58.232
Hey, Stevie, you okay?

06:00.151 --> 06:02.236
I got...

06:06.449 --> 06:08.826
I got the wind knocked out of me.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.786
Looks like a cave.

06:21.298 --> 06:24.049
Stevie, what's goin' on?

06:28.805 --> 06:30.639
It's a human skull!

06:30.765 --> 06:33.976
- Toss it up here!
- No way! It's mine.

06:34.102 --> 06:37.813
Anyway, there's bones
all over the place, man!

06:51.953 --> 06:53.579
What the...

07:16.478 --> 07:18.520
Stevie?

07:18.647 --> 07:20.856
- Hey, Stevie!
- You okay?

07:24.194 --> 07:27.696
Hey, man... let's get outta here!

08:09.072 --> 08:11.115
Give me a 14-footer!

08:13.076 --> 08:17.287
This is Captain Miles Cooles.
Rescue situation in progress.

08:17.414 --> 08:21.959
Rope's in the hole.
Let's go. Two down.

08:28.633 --> 08:30.718
What ya got, TC? Talk to me.

08:32.971 --> 08:34.972
Do you see the boy?

08:38.768 --> 08:41.979
Come back, TC. You see the kid?

08:43.898 --> 08:45.607
Danny, check TC's radio.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.193
TC?

08:48.319 --> 08:50.446
Glenn, Sal, in the hole!

09:21.936 --> 09:25.689
- Get those people outta here!
- Move 'em back!

09:25.815 --> 09:27.274
Move back, folks!

09:28.860 --> 09:34.865
I sent four men down there for the boy.
Report is, his eyes had turned black.

09:34.991 --> 09:38.327
Now we've lost communication with my men.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.385
What about my men?

09:59.474 --> 10:02.184
What about my men!

10:15.115 --> 10:17.658
What the hell is this?

10:46.354 --> 10:48.063
It's Bronschweig.

10:48.189 --> 10:53.110
Sir, the impossible scenario
that we never planned for?

10:53.444 --> 10:55.112
We'd better come up with a plan.

11:28.813 --> 11:31.356
We've evacuated the building.

11:31.482 --> 11:37.070
- There's no trace of an explosive device.
- You sent the dogs through?

11:37.197 --> 11:38.113
Yes, sir.

11:38.239 --> 11:40.115
Send 'em through again.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.162
All right, guys.

11:45.288 --> 11:47.414
Let's do it again!

12:14.651 --> 12:16.526
Mulder, it's me.

12:16.653 --> 12:19.029
- Where are you, Scully?
- On the roof.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.990
- Find anything?
- No, I haven't.

12:22.825 --> 12:24.034
What's wrong?

12:24.160 --> 12:27.704
I just climbed up 12 floors,
I'm hot, I'm thirsty,...

12:27.830 --> 12:30.707
.. and I'm wondering what I'm doing.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.709
You're looking for a bomb.

12:32.835 --> 12:36.129
But the threat was made
on the Federal Building.

12:36.339 --> 12:38.382
They have that covered.

12:38.508 --> 12:45.138
When a bomb threat is called in, the rational
purpose of it is to allow us to find the bomb.

12:45.265 --> 12:49.685
The rational object of terrorism
is to promote terror.

12:49.936 --> 12:56.608
There's a model behavioural pattern for every
case where a threat has turned up a bomb.

12:56.859 --> 13:00.487
And if we ignore that data, as we have done,...

13:00.613 --> 13:05.284
.. the chances are great that,
if there is a bomb, we might not find it.

13:05.535 --> 13:07.619
Lives could be lost.

13:07.745 --> 13:11.164
Mulder?

13:11.291 --> 13:12.082
Boom!

13:12.208 --> 13:13.500
Jesus, Mulder!

13:13.626 --> 13:16.128
Whatever happened to hunches?

13:17.422 --> 13:20.424
Random acts of unpredictability.

13:20.550 --> 13:26.096
If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen
in a universe of infinite possibilities,...

13:26.222 --> 13:32.060
.. we may find ourselves at the mercy
of anything that cannot be categorised.

13:34.772 --> 13:38.567
What are we doin' up here, Scully?
It's hotter than hell.

13:42.572 --> 13:48.201
I know you're bored, but unconventional
thinking will only get you into trouble now.

13:48.328 --> 13:52.873
- Why do you think I'm bored?
- Quit looking for what isn't there.

13:52.999 --> 13:56.251
They've closed the X-Files.
We follow procedure now.

13:56.377 --> 14:02.257
Let's make a bomb threat to Houston.
It's free-beer night at the Astrodome.

14:07.138 --> 14:08.096
Now what?

14:08.222 --> 14:09.723
It's locked?

14:09.849 --> 14:12.934
So much for anticipating the unforeseen!

14:15.938 --> 14:18.273
- I had you.
- No, you didn't.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.859
- I had you big time.
- You had nothing.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.694
I saw you jiggle the handle.

14:24.781 --> 14:28.325
I saw your face.
There was a definite moment of panic.

14:28.451 --> 14:32.537
You've never seen me panic.
When I panic, I make this face.

14:32.663 --> 14:33.705
That was it.

14:33.831 --> 14:38.001
- You didn't see that face.
- I saw that face. You're buying.

14:40.046 --> 14:42.005
Coke? Pepsi? Saline IV?

14:42.131 --> 14:44.257
Somethin' sweet.

16:03.254 --> 16:06.089
Scully.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.924
I've found the bomb.

16:08.050 --> 16:11.261
You're funny. Where are you, Mulder?

16:11.554 --> 16:13.638
I'm in the vending room.

16:15.308 --> 16:18.018
Is that you pounding?

16:18.144 --> 16:21.354
Yeah. Get somebody to open that door.

16:22.190 --> 16:25.734
- Nice try, Mulder.
- It's in the soda machine.

16:25.860 --> 16:28.153
You got 14 minutes to evacuate.

16:29.947 --> 16:31.615
Come on, Mulder.

16:31.741 --> 16:33.200
13.56...

16:33.326 --> 16:35.410
13.54...

16:35.870 --> 16:37.829
13.52...

16:37.955 --> 16:39.289
13.50...

16:39.415 --> 16:43.585
You see a pattern emerging here, Scully?

16:50.718 --> 16:52.469
I'll get you outta there!

16:58.017 --> 17:01.102
I need this building evacuated in ten minutes!

17:01.229 --> 17:05.523
Have the fire department block off
a one-mile radius around the building!

17:05.650 --> 17:09.194
- Ten minutes?
- Don't think! Just make it happen!

17:10.279 --> 17:11.863
This is Security...

17:13.199 --> 17:17.368
This is Special Agent Dana Scully.
I need to speak with SAC Michaud.

17:17.494 --> 17:19.496
He's got the wrong building.

17:35.638 --> 17:38.265
- Where is it?
- Vending machine.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.350
He's locked in with it.

18:01.872 --> 18:05.792
You know that face I just showed you?
I'm making it again.

18:06.210 --> 18:10.046
Move away from the door.
We're coming through.

18:22.977 --> 18:24.144
Clear!

18:30.443 --> 18:34.696
Tell me that's just soda pop
in those canisters.

18:40.703 --> 18:43.705
It's just what it looks like. A big IED.

18:44.582 --> 18:47.542
Ten gallons of Astrolite.

18:48.586 --> 18:52.714
Okay. Get everybody outta here.
Clear the area.

18:54.175 --> 18:58.928
- Someone's gotta stay here with you.
- I gave you an order to evacuate.

18:59.055 --> 19:01.181
Can you defuse it?

19:01.766 --> 19:03.350
Yes, I can.

19:03.476 --> 19:07.604
- We got four minutes to find out.
- Did you hear what I said?

19:07.730 --> 19:10.023
Get out!

19:13.944 --> 19:15.654
Come on, Mulder.

19:58.739 --> 20:00.657
Mulder, what are you doing!

20:00.783 --> 20:03.618
- Something's wrong!
- Mulder!

20:03.953 --> 20:07.831
- Something's not right.
- Get in the car! There's no time!

20:09.083 --> 20:10.291
Let's go!

20:21.011 --> 20:23.138
Come on, come on!

21:28.496 --> 21:31.372
Next time, you're buying.

21:45.221 --> 21:48.264
In light of Waco and Ruby Ridge,...

21:48.390 --> 21:53.937
.. there is a need at the Attorney General's
office to place responsibility...

21:54.063 --> 21:59.359
.. for the catastrophic destruction of public
property and loss of life due to terrorism.

21:59.485 --> 22:03.988
Details are unclear, but we're under
pressure from the Attorney General...

22:04.114 --> 22:08.785
.. to give a true account of what happened,
so she can issue a public statement.

22:08.911 --> 22:13.373
We know now that five people
died in the explosion:

22:13.499 --> 22:14.666
Special...

22:18.462 --> 22:23.466
Special Agent in Charge Darius Michaud
who was trying to defuse the bomb,...

22:23.592 --> 22:26.177
.. three firemen from Dallas, and a young boy.

22:27.805 --> 22:32.475
Excuse me? The firemen and the young boy
were found in the building?

22:32.601 --> 22:38.147
Agent Mulder, since you weren't on time
for this hearing, please step outside...

22:38.274 --> 22:42.861
.. so that we can hear
Agent Scully's version of the facts.

22:42.987 --> 22:49.659
- We were told the building was clear.
- You'll get your turn. Please step outside.

23:09.597 --> 23:12.891
They're still talking to Agent Scully.

23:13.142 --> 23:14.726
About what?

23:14.852 --> 23:19.063
They want to know why
she was in the wrong building.

23:19.189 --> 23:21.274
She was with me.

23:24.194 --> 23:29.699
You don't get it, do you? There's $45 million
worth of damage to the city of Dallas.

23:29.825 --> 23:32.869
Lives have been lost.
No suspects have been named.

23:32.995 --> 23:36.581
The story is that
this could've been prevented.

23:36.707 --> 23:38.833
They wanna blame us?

23:40.961 --> 23:45.214
We both know that if it looks bad,
it's bad for the FBI.

23:45.341 --> 23:48.051
Blame has to be assigned somewhere.

23:49.261 --> 23:55.183
- But Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.
- She's saying the same about you.

23:55.309 --> 24:01.189
I breached protocol. I broke contact with
the SAC. I left him alone with the device.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.442
Agent Scully says you wanted to go back.

24:04.568 --> 24:05.777
No.

24:13.535 --> 24:16.120
They're asking for you, sir.

24:17.247 --> 24:18.706
Thank you.

24:22.378 --> 24:26.923
- You don't have to protect me.
- I told them the truth.

24:27.049 --> 24:29.634
They're trying to divide us.

24:30.719 --> 24:34.013
They have divided us. They're splitting us up.

24:34.139 --> 24:36.432
What are you talking about?

24:36.558 --> 24:40.269
I meet with OPR in two days
for reassignment.

24:40.396 --> 24:41.688
They put us together!

24:41.814 --> 24:46.275
So I could invalidate your investigations
into the paranormal. But...

24:46.402 --> 24:48.611
.. I think this goes deeper than that now.

24:48.737 --> 24:52.907
- They're doing this to me.
- They're not doing this.

24:56.704 --> 25:02.542
I left behind a career in medicine because
I thought I could make a difference at the FBI.

25:02.668 --> 25:05.420
But it hasn't turned out that way.

25:05.546 --> 25:11.426
And now if they transfer me to Omaha
or Cleveland or some field office,...

25:11.552 --> 25:18.725
.. it doesn't hold the interest for me that it
once did. Not after what I've seen and done.

25:20.769 --> 25:22.437
You're quitting.

25:24.773 --> 25:28.735
Maybe you should ask yourself
if your heart's still in it, too.

25:33.615 --> 25:36.492
Agent Mulder, you're up.

25:36.618 --> 25:38.661
I'm sorry.

25:41.623 --> 25:42.707
Mulder...

25:46.837 --> 25:48.463
Good luck.

26:10.819 --> 26:16.532
I'd say this about exceeds
your minimum daily requirement.

26:19.244 --> 26:23.998
Whoa! You've gotta train
for that kind of heavy lifting.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.126
Poopy day?

26:32.341 --> 26:33.800
So,...

26:33.926 --> 26:35.760
.. what do you do?

26:36.929 --> 26:38.846
- What do I do?
- Mm-hm.

26:42.309 --> 26:48.815
I'm the key figure in a government plot
to deny the existence of extraterrestrials.

26:48.941 --> 26:54.237
It's a global conspiracy with key players
in the highest levels of power.

26:54.488 --> 26:59.200
And it reaches down into the lives of every
man, woman and child on this planet.

27:01.120 --> 27:04.080
So, of course, no-one believes me.

27:04.206 --> 27:08.584
I'm an annoyance to my superiors,
a joke to my peers. They call me Spooky.

27:08.752 --> 27:11.963
Spooky Mulder,
whose sister was abducted by aliens,...

27:12.214 --> 27:15.675
.. who chases after little green men
with a badge and a gun,...

27:15.801 --> 27:18.928
.. shouting to the heavens
to anyone who will listen...

27:19.054 --> 27:21.180
.. that the sky is falling.

27:21.306 --> 27:25.977
And when it hits,
it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time.

27:29.231 --> 27:30.565
Well...

27:32.317 --> 27:36.112
- I would say that about does it, Spooky.
- Does what?

27:36.238 --> 27:38.990
Looks like 86 is your lucky number.

27:48.458 --> 27:52.253
You know, one is the loneliest number.

28:25.787 --> 28:26.746
Hello?

28:26.872 --> 28:28.956
- Whoa!
- Sorry.

28:47.517 --> 28:49.477
That official FBI business?

28:50.729 --> 28:51.812
What?

28:51.939 --> 28:55.524
Bet the Bureau's accusing you
of the same thing in Dallas.

28:55.651 --> 29:00.071
Standing around holding your yank
while bombs are exploding.

29:04.284 --> 29:06.244
Do I know you?

29:06.370 --> 29:09.997
No, but I've been watching your career
for a good while.

29:10.123 --> 29:13.834
Back when you were
a promising young agent. Before that.

29:15.170 --> 29:18.089
- You come out here for a reason?
- Yeah...

29:18.340 --> 29:20.424
I did.

29:21.843 --> 29:24.011
My name is Kurtzweil.

29:24.137 --> 29:26.180
Dr Alvin Kurtzweil.

29:26.306 --> 29:30.893
- Am I supposed to know that name?
- Old friend of your father's.

29:31.436 --> 29:34.772
At the State Department
we were fellow travellers.

29:35.023 --> 29:38.943
But his disenchantment outlasted mine.

29:48.662 --> 29:50.705
How'd you find me?

29:51.248 --> 29:55.251
I heard you come in here.
I figured you'd need a drink tonight.

29:55.377 --> 30:00.089
- You a reporter?
- A doctor, which I mentioned. OB-GYN.

30:00.215 --> 30:02.550
You got something to tell me, say it.

30:02.676 --> 30:06.053
There's something you don't know
about the bombing in Dallas.

30:06.346 --> 30:07.513
What's that?

30:07.639 --> 30:11.851
SAC Darius Michaud never tried
or intended to defuse that bomb.

30:11.977 --> 30:14.770
He just let it explode in his face, huh?

30:14.896 --> 30:18.899
What is no-one asking? Why that building?
Why not the Federal Building?

30:19.026 --> 30:21.152
It was too well guarded.

30:21.278 --> 30:23.654
They bombed the other building...

30:23.780 --> 30:26.782
.. because it did have Federal officers there.

30:26.908 --> 30:29.660
The Federal Emergency
Management Agency...

30:29.786 --> 30:33.331
.. had a quarantine office there,
where the bodies were found.

30:33.457 --> 30:37.335
That's the thing you didn't know.
The thing you'd never think to check.

30:37.586 --> 30:40.087
Those people were already dead.

30:42.007 --> 30:44.050
Before the bomb went off?

30:44.176 --> 30:46.052
That's what I'm saying.

30:48.430 --> 30:50.639
Darius Michaud was a 22-year veteran...

30:50.766 --> 30:55.644
Michaud was a patriot. The people he was
loyal to know their way around Dallas.

30:55.771 --> 31:00.191
They blew that building to hide something.
Something they couldn't predict.

31:00.317 --> 31:04.236
They blew up a building
just to hide the bodies of those firemen?

31:04.363 --> 31:06.322
And one little boy.

31:07.574 --> 31:09.617
I think you're full of shit.

31:10.952 --> 31:13.120
Do you?

31:17.584 --> 31:20.127
Arlington, please.

31:34.476 --> 31:37.311
Actually, no, let's go to Georgetown.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.940
Let's go to Georgetown.

32:08.927 --> 32:11.720
- I woke you. Did I wake you?
- No.

32:11.847 --> 32:13.722
Why not? It's 3am.

32:13.849 --> 32:15.933
Are you drunk?

32:17.060 --> 32:20.146
I- I was until about 20 minutes ago, yeah.

32:20.272 --> 32:23.566
Was that before or after
you decided to come here?

32:23.692 --> 32:25.484
What are you implying?

32:27.070 --> 32:29.363
- Go home, Mulder.
- No, get dressed.

32:29.489 --> 32:31.907
- It's late.
- Get dressed.

32:32.033 --> 32:34.368
- What are you doing?
- I'll explain on the way.

34:25.981 --> 34:28.107
Got something to show me?

34:35.364 --> 34:39.827
We brought the atmosphere back down
to freezing, to control the development,...

34:39.953 --> 34:42.955
.. which is like nothing we've ever seen.

34:43.081 --> 34:46.166
- Brought on by what?
- Heat, I think.

34:46.293 --> 34:48.877
The coincident invasion of a host,...

34:49.004 --> 34:51.130
.. the fireman,...

34:51.255 --> 34:56.844
.. and an environment that raised
his body temperature above 98.6.

35:05.770 --> 35:07.813
This man's still alive.

35:07.939 --> 35:10.608
Technically... and biologically.

35:10.859 --> 35:13.152
But... he'll never recover.

35:17.073 --> 35:18.407
How can this be?

35:18.533 --> 35:24.705
The developing organism is using
his life energy, digesting bone and tissue.

35:25.749 --> 35:28.375
We've just... slowed the process.

35:30.962 --> 35:34.340
Shall we destroy this one, too?
Before it gestates?

35:34.466 --> 35:37.176
Uh, no. No.

35:37.302 --> 35:40.554
We need to try our vaccine on it.

35:40.680 --> 35:43.098
And if it's unsuccessful?

35:43.224 --> 35:46.560
Burn it. Like the others.

36:09.876 --> 36:13.420
- ID and floor you're visiting.
- The morgue.

36:14.756 --> 36:17.132
That area's currently off limits.

36:17.258 --> 36:19.677
- On whose orders?
- General McAddie.

36:19.803 --> 36:23.972
We were woken at 3am and told
to get down here immediately.

36:24.099 --> 36:26.016
I don't know about that.

36:26.142 --> 36:28.977
- Call General McAddie.
- I don't have the number.

36:29.104 --> 36:30.521
Call the switchboard.

36:33.483 --> 36:35.150
You don't know their number?

36:35.276 --> 36:40.239
- I'll call my CO.
- We don't have time for you to dick around.

36:40.448 --> 36:43.033
Our order came from McAddie. Call him.

36:43.159 --> 36:47.830
We'll conduct our business
while you confirm authorisation.

36:49.499 --> 36:53.377
Why don't you head on down,
and I'll confirm authorisation.

36:53.503 --> 36:55.254
Thank you.

36:55.380 --> 36:59.758
Why is the morgue suddenly off limits
on the orders of the general?

36:59.884 --> 37:03.679
This is one of the firemen
who died in Dallas?

37:03.805 --> 37:05.681
According to the toe tag.

37:05.807 --> 37:09.435
- And you're looking for...?
- Cause of death.

37:09.644 --> 37:13.188
I can tell you that
without even looking at him.

37:13.314 --> 37:18.485
"Concussive organ failure due to
exposure to source and flying debris. "

37:18.611 --> 37:21.989
Mulder, this man's already been autopsied.

37:25.994 --> 37:29.705
Does this fit the description
you just read me?

37:34.377 --> 37:38.046
- Oh, my God! This man's tissue...
- It's like jelly.

37:40.550 --> 37:45.137
There's been some kind
of cellular breakdown.

37:48.975 --> 37:51.935
God, it's completely oedematous!

37:53.813 --> 37:58.108
There's been no autopsy performed.
No Y-incision,...

37:59.027 --> 38:00.736
.. no internal exam.

38:00.862 --> 38:04.406
So the cause of death on that report is false?

38:04.532 --> 38:07.409
This man didn't die from an explosion?

38:07.535 --> 38:13.040
I can't tell you what killed this man.
I'm not sure anybody else could, either.

38:19.214 --> 38:23.300
Mulder, you knew this man
didn't die at the bomb site.

38:23.426 --> 38:27.179
- I'd been told as much.
- You're saying this is a cover-up?

38:27.305 --> 38:28.722
Of what?

38:28.973 --> 38:33.435
I don't know. But I've a hunch it won't be
anything that can be categorised.

38:33.561 --> 38:40.108
Mulder, this is gonna take time. Somebody
is gonna figure out we shouldn't be here.

38:40.401 --> 38:45.614
We are being blamed for this man's death.
I want to know what he died of. Don't you?

39:01.840 --> 39:04.675
That's it, up here.

39:24.946 --> 39:29.449
- Excuse me? Can I help you?
- Is this Dr Kurtzweil's residence?

39:31.452 --> 39:35.789
- You have business with him?
- Yeah, I'm looking for him.

39:35.915 --> 39:38.041
Looking for him for what?

39:39.836 --> 39:44.339
The Feds are lookin' for him, too.
Nice business he's got, huh?

39:44.465 --> 39:46.425
What's that?

39:46.551 --> 39:50.721
Selling naked pictures of little kids
on his computer.

39:55.476 --> 39:59.187
You looking for him
for some other reason?

39:59.314 --> 40:03.442
Yeah. I had an appointment
for a pelvic examination.

40:10.199 --> 40:14.369
- You want a call if we find this Kurtzweil?
- Don't bother.

40:36.809 --> 40:40.228
See this crap?
Somebody knows I'm talking to you.

40:40.355 --> 40:42.606
Not according to the men in blue.

40:42.732 --> 40:46.068
Is it kiddie porn again?
Sexual battery of a patient?

40:46.194 --> 40:50.822
- They wanna discredit you. Why?
- Because I know too much about the truth.

40:50.949 --> 40:53.951
That end-of-the-world garbage you write?

40:54.077 --> 40:55.953
You know my work?

40:58.122 --> 41:00.457
- I was right about Dallas.
- How?

41:00.583 --> 41:03.210
Do you know of the Hanta virus?

41:03.336 --> 41:09.216
Yeah. A deadly virus spread by field mice
several years ago.

41:09.509 --> 41:13.804
The newspaper says FEMA was called out
to manage an outbreak.

41:13.930 --> 41:19.476
Do you know what the Federal Emergency
Management Agency's real power is?

41:19.602 --> 41:25.148
It can suspend constitutional government
upon declaration of a national emergency.

41:25.274 --> 41:27.275
Think about that.

41:27.402 --> 41:34.074
What is such a powerful agency doing
managing a small viral outbreak in Texas?

41:34.242 --> 41:39.955
- You saying it wasn't a small outbreak?
- No. I'm saying it wasn't the Hanta virus.

41:40.081 --> 41:41.832
Well, what was it?

41:47.630 --> 41:49.756
What was it?

41:51.968 --> 41:57.764
Years ago, your father and I were recruited
for a project. Biological warfare. A virus.

41:57.890 --> 41:59.766
What killed those men?

41:59.892 --> 42:04.896
Something I won't even write about.
We have no context for what it is.

42:05.023 --> 42:09.026
Or any appreciation of the scale
at which it will be unleashed.

42:09.152 --> 42:11.236
A plague?

42:12.613 --> 42:14.740
The plague to end all plagues.

42:14.866 --> 42:17.576
A silent weapon for a quiet war.

42:17.702 --> 42:23.498
The systematic release of an indiscriminate
organism for which there is no cure.

42:23.624 --> 42:26.793
They've been working on this for 50 years.

42:26.919 --> 42:33.133
While the rest of the world fought Commies,
these men were negotiating an Armageddon.

42:33.259 --> 42:35.510
Negotiating with whom?

42:35.636 --> 42:37.721
I think you know.

42:37.847 --> 42:43.852
The timetable has been set. It'll happen
on a holiday when people are travelling.

42:43.978 --> 42:49.316
A state of emergency will be declared.
Government will come under the power...

42:49.567 --> 42:52.736
.. of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.

42:53.488 --> 42:57.157
FEMA. The secret government.

42:58.534 --> 43:00.577
They call me paranoid!

43:00.703 --> 43:04.456
Go back to Dallas, Agent Mulder, and dig.

43:05.458 --> 43:10.253
Or we'll find out along with the rest
of the country... when it's too late.

44:02.890 --> 44:04.766
Scully, it's me.

44:05.393 --> 44:07.978
- Yeah.
- Why are you whispering?

44:08.104 --> 44:09.938
I can't talk right now.

44:10.064 --> 44:14.442
- What did you find?
- Evidence of a massive infection.

44:14.569 --> 44:18.029
- What kind of infection?
- I don't know.

44:19.490 --> 44:22.534
I'm gonna book a flight to Dallas.

44:22.660 --> 44:24.452
I'll get you a ticket, too.

44:24.579 --> 44:26.955
- Mulder...
- I need your expertise.

44:27.081 --> 44:30.917
- It's my hearing tomorrow.
- I'll get you back in time.

44:31.043 --> 44:33.128
Maybe with new evidence.

44:33.254 --> 44:36.548
I can't!
I'm past the point of common sense here.

44:36.674 --> 44:40.760
It's not common sense. It's...

44:41.470 --> 44:44.764
Are you there? Scul...

44:44.891 --> 44:46.933
Scully?

45:18.966 --> 45:21.718
You're looking
for a needle in a haystack.

45:21.844 --> 45:25.680
There was so much devastation,
we haven't put much together yet.

45:25.806 --> 45:30.310
I'm looking for anything unusual.
Maybe something from the FEMA offices...

45:30.436 --> 45:35.023
- .. where the bodies were found.
- We sent those remains off to Washington.

45:35.149 --> 45:38.777
Anything that you haven't sent off yet?

45:38.903 --> 45:45.283
Some bone fragments FEMA recovered
from an archaeological site outta town.

45:45.409 --> 45:48.745
- Have you examined them?
- No. They're just fossils.

45:51.749 --> 45:55.502
I'd like you to let this person
take a look at them.

45:58.714 --> 46:00.924
Just let me get them.

46:04.762 --> 46:08.098
- You said you weren't coming.
- I wasn't planning to.

46:08.224 --> 46:13.728
But I got a better look at the samples
I took from the fireman.

46:13.980 --> 46:15.563
And what did you find?

46:15.690 --> 46:20.610
Something I couldn't show to anybody else
without causing attention.

46:22.738 --> 46:29.202
But what those men were infected with
contains a protein coat I've never seen before.

46:29.328 --> 46:31.037
What it did to them, it did very fast.

46:31.163 --> 46:34.249
- How was it contracted?
- I don't know.

46:34.375 --> 46:38.586
But it could be a serious health threat.

46:40.381 --> 46:45.427
These fossils weren't near the blast centre
so they won't tell you much.

46:45.553 --> 46:48.680
Right. Why don't you check this out?

47:08.534 --> 47:13.538
- Where were these found?
- I'll show you right on the map.

47:48.949 --> 47:52.035
I want all of these settings checked.

47:52.161 --> 47:57.665
I want a steady minus two degrees Celsius
throughout the transfer of the body...

47:57.792 --> 48:00.335
.. after I've administered the vaccine.

48:36.163 --> 48:38.123
- It's gone!
- It's what?

48:38.249 --> 48:41.668
It's left the body. I think it's gestated.

48:43.462 --> 48:46.881
- What's the matter?
- Wait.

48:48.676 --> 48:50.093
I can see it.

48:58.394 --> 48:59.727
Oh...

48:59.854 --> 49:02.147
Jesus, Lord...

49:04.316 --> 49:06.568
- You see it?
- Yeah.

49:06.694 --> 49:09.279
So much for little green men!

49:11.365 --> 49:14.784
I need you down here.

50:17.556 --> 50:20.141
Help... I need help.

50:26.607 --> 50:28.650
What are you doing?

50:30.194 --> 50:31.653
What are you doing!

50:39.161 --> 50:41.913
Oh, my God!

51:10.025 --> 51:12.110
Sir, you have a call.

51:24.665 --> 51:25.665
Yes?

51:25.791 --> 51:29.168
We have a situation.
The members are assembling.

51:29.295 --> 51:30.461
Is it an emergency?

51:30.588 --> 51:35.633
Yes. A meeting has been set,
tonight in London.

51:35.759 --> 51:37.552
Who called it?

51:37.678 --> 51:41.806
Strughold. He just got on a plane in Tunis.

52:13.881 --> 52:18.217
- Has Strughold arrived?
- Yes. They're in the library, sir.

52:30.064 --> 52:35.360
We were worried. Some of us have travelled
so far, and you are the last to arrive.

52:35.611 --> 52:38.946
I'm sorry. My grandson broke his leg.

52:39.073 --> 52:46.412
While we've been waiting, we've seen
surveillance tapes that raise more concerns.

52:46.538 --> 52:48.831
More concerns than what?

52:48.957 --> 52:53.294
We have been forced to reassess
our role in colonisation...

52:53.420 --> 52:57.840
.. by recently presented facts of biology.

52:57.966 --> 52:59.759
The virus has mutated.

52:59.885 --> 53:01.886
Into what?

53:02.012 --> 53:06.015
A new extraterrestrial biological entity.

53:07.393 --> 53:09.352
My God...

53:09.478 --> 53:14.816
The geometry of mass infection means
we must re-evaluate their colonisation.

53:14.942 --> 53:20.488
This isn't colonisation.
This is spontaneous repopulation.

53:21.990 --> 53:23.658
All our work...

53:23.784 --> 53:28.913
If it's true, they've been using us all along.
We've been labouring under a lie.

53:29.039 --> 53:33.126
- It could be an isolated case.
- How can we know?

53:33.252 --> 53:37.171
We're going to tell them
what we've learned...

53:37.297 --> 53:41.676
.. by turning over a body
infected with the gestating organism.

53:41.802 --> 53:45.722
In hope of what?
Learning that it's true?

53:45.848 --> 53:50.643
That we are nothing but digestives
for the creation of a new race of aliens?

53:50.769 --> 53:53.855
By co-operating
we hasten our own demise.

53:53.981 --> 53:57.316
It's the only chance of saving ourselves.

53:57.443 --> 54:00.570
They still need us to make their preparations.

54:00.696 --> 54:06.117
We'll continue to use them as they do us,
if only to get more time to work...

54:06.326 --> 54:07.952
.. on our vaccine.

54:08.078 --> 54:14.208
My lateness might as well have been
absence. A course has already been taken.

54:14.334 --> 54:16.544
There are complications.

54:16.712 --> 54:20.965
Mulder saw one of the infected bodies
we destroyed in Dallas.

54:21.091 --> 54:23.551
He's there now. Someone tipped him.

54:23.677 --> 54:24.761
Who?

54:26.722 --> 54:31.726
- Kurtzweil, we think.
- No-one believes Kurtzweil. Or his books.

54:31.852 --> 54:33.770
He's a crank.

54:33.896 --> 54:35.563
Mulder believes him.

54:35.689 --> 54:40.401
- Then Kurtzweil must be removed.
- As must Mulder.

54:40.527 --> 54:46.449
Kill Mulder... we take the risk
of turning one man's quest into a crusade.

54:46.575 --> 54:49.702
Then take away
what he holds most valuable.

54:49.828 --> 54:51.996
That with which he can't live without.

54:57.544 --> 55:02.840
I don't see any evidence of an archaeological
or any other kind of a dig site.

55:02.966 --> 55:05.760
This is where he marked on the map.

55:05.886 --> 55:11.098
You're sure those fossils were infected
with the same virus you saw at the morgue?

55:11.225 --> 55:16.562
Both sets of bones were porous.
As if the virus were decomposing it.

55:16.688 --> 55:19.482
- And you've never seen that virus before?
- No.

55:22.611 --> 55:24.695
Look at that.

55:37.709 --> 55:42.505
- That look like new grass to you?
- Pretty green for this climate.

55:47.094 --> 55:50.847
Ground's dry about an inch down.
This was laid recently.

55:50.973 --> 55:52.974
The equipment's brand-new, too.

55:53.100 --> 55:57.228
No irrigation system.
Somebody's covering their tracks.

56:04.611 --> 56:08.114
Hey!

56:09.408 --> 56:11.659
You boys live around here?

56:11.785 --> 56:12.785
Yeah.

56:12.911 --> 56:15.079
Seen anybody digging over there?

56:15.205 --> 56:17.456
We're not supposed to say.

56:17.708 --> 56:20.459
- Who told you that?
- Nobody.

56:20.586 --> 56:23.880
Same nobody that built that playground?

56:24.006 --> 56:27.884
Nobody buy you
those new bikes, too?

56:28.135 --> 56:31.345
- You'd better tell us.
- We don't even know you.

56:31.471 --> 56:32.847
We're FBI agents.

56:32.973 --> 56:34.724
You're not FBI agents.

56:34.850 --> 56:39.312
- How do you know?
- Cos y'all look like door-to-door salesmen.

56:43.358 --> 56:45.651
Hey, you wanna buy a badge?

56:46.862 --> 56:48.613
They left an hour ago.

56:48.739 --> 56:51.032
Going that way.

57:04.129 --> 57:06.714
Unmarked tanker trucks.

57:06.840 --> 57:10.051
What do archaeologists
haul out in tanker trucks?

57:10.177 --> 57:12.929
- I don't know.
- Where are they going with it?

57:13.055 --> 57:16.682
That's the first question to answer
if we're gonna find them.

57:26.485 --> 57:27.860
What are my choices?

57:28.028 --> 57:32.698
- 100 miles of nothing in both directions.
- Which way do you think they went?

57:32.824 --> 57:35.034
You got two choices. One's wrong.

57:39.081 --> 57:42.166
- I think they went left.
- I think they went right.

58:00.018 --> 58:04.230
Five years together.
How many times have I been wrong?

58:04.356 --> 58:06.440
Never.

58:07.192 --> 58:08.818
Not driving, anyway.

58:54.489 --> 58:58.200
- I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
- This is great. This is fitting.

58:58.326 --> 59:00.745
What?

59:00.871 --> 59:07.918
I have to be in Washington DC in 11 hours
for a hearing concerning my career.

59:08.045 --> 59:13.007
And I'm in the middle of nowhere,
chasing phantom tanker trucks.

59:13.133 --> 59:15.176
We're chasing evidence.

59:15.302 --> 59:16.427
Of what?

59:16.553 --> 59:21.557
That bomb went off to hide something:
bodies infected with a virus you detected.

59:21.683 --> 59:27.021
They haul oil in tanker trucks. They haul gas
in tanker trucks. They do not haul viruses.

59:27.147 --> 59:31.025
Well, they may be hauling a virus
in these tanker trucks.

59:31.151 --> 59:33.152
What do you mean? Mulder?

59:33.278 --> 59:35.821
What are you not telling me?

59:37.074 --> 59:39.366
Mulder!

59:41.328 --> 59:43.788
The virus may be extraterrestrial.

59:48.001 --> 59:50.503
I don't...

59:50.629 --> 59:53.089
Mulder, I don't...

01:01:20.594 --> 01:01:24.430
- What do you think they are?
- I have no idea.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:08.390
This is weird, Mulder.

01:02:09.142 --> 01:02:10.351
Very weird.

01:02:10.477 --> 01:02:14.438
Why would anyone grow corn
in the middle of the desert?

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:17.942
Those could be giant Jiffy Pop poppers.

01:03:29.055 --> 01:03:31.557
It's cool in here.

01:03:31.725 --> 01:03:34.601
The temperature's being regulated.

01:03:34.728 --> 01:03:36.729
For the purpose of what?

01:03:36.855 --> 01:03:41.650
I think we're on top of a larger structure.
This is some kind of a venting system.

01:03:41.901 --> 01:03:43.902
Do you hear something?

01:03:49.784 --> 01:03:52.911
I hear a humming. Like electricity.

01:03:54.205 --> 01:03:55.622
High voltage, maybe.

01:03:55.749 --> 01:03:57.750
Maybe.

01:04:03.256 --> 01:04:05.341
Maybe not.

01:04:12.766 --> 01:04:14.308
Scully...

01:04:14.434 --> 01:04:16.935
- Yeah?
- Run!

01:04:31.117 --> 01:04:31.950
Scully!

01:04:32.077 --> 01:04:34.536
I can't see!

01:04:37.165 --> 01:04:39.416
Give me your hand!

01:04:48.676 --> 01:04:52.388
- Did you get stung?
- I don't think so.

01:06:07.005 --> 01:06:08.213
Talk to me, Scully!

01:06:08.339 --> 01:06:11.008
Scully!

01:06:12.051 --> 01:06:13.677
Damn it! Scully!

01:06:20.393 --> 01:06:21.894
Scully!

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:23.729
Scully!

01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:26.231
Talk to me, Scully!

01:06:26.357 --> 01:06:27.858
Mulder!

01:06:32.197 --> 01:06:33.363
Scully!

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:35.699
Mulder!

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:37.451
Can you hear me?

01:06:37.577 --> 01:06:38.327
Mulder...

01:06:50.673 --> 01:06:58.597
Scully!

01:07:00.141 --> 01:07:01.099
Mulder!

01:07:01.226 --> 01:07:02.142
Scully!

01:07:02.268 --> 01:07:04.144
Scully, talk to me!

01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:05.437
Mulder...

01:07:11.903 --> 01:07:13.111
Where'd they go?

01:07:16.824 --> 01:07:18.951
Come on!

01:07:45.395 --> 01:07:46.645
She's coming in.

01:07:55.572 --> 01:07:57.322
Special Agent Scully.

01:07:57.448 --> 01:07:59.575
I apologise for making you wait.

01:07:59.701 --> 01:08:02.035
I have new evidence.

01:08:02.161 --> 01:08:03.829
Evidence of what?

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:09.543
These are fossilised bone fragments...

01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:14.506
.. that were gathered
at the bomb site in Dallas.

01:08:14.632 --> 01:08:17.884
- You've been back to Dallas?
- Yes.

01:08:27.854 --> 01:08:31.273
- You found something.
- In Texas, some kind of experiment.

01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:33.899
Tankers carrying something they excavated.

01:08:34.027 --> 01:08:38.404
- What?
- I'm not sure. A virus, I think.

01:08:38.531 --> 01:08:44.786
I also have reason to believe that there may
have been involvement by SAC Michaud.

01:08:44.912 --> 01:08:49.666
Those are very serious allegations,
Agent Scully.

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:52.044
Yes, I know.

01:08:52.170 --> 01:08:55.087
- You saw this experiment?
- Yeah. We were chased off.

01:08:55.214 --> 01:08:59.259
- What did it look like?
- There were bees, corn crops.

01:09:00.928 --> 01:09:04.723
And you have conclusive evidence
to tie your claim to the crime?

01:09:06.225 --> 01:09:14.232
Not completely conclusive. We're working
towards gathering that evidence.

01:09:14.524 --> 01:09:15.901
Working with?

01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:20.197
With Agent Mulder.

01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:24.283
- What are they?
- What do you think?

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:29.747
Transportation system. Transgenic crops.
The pollen altered to carry a virus.

01:09:29.874 --> 01:09:31.332
That's my guess.

01:09:34.295 --> 01:09:35.087
Guess?

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:38.924
What do you mean?
Hey! You told me you had answers.

01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:41.301
Yeah, but I don't have 'em all.

01:09:41.426 --> 01:09:45.471
- You didn't know my father.
- He and I were old friends.

01:09:45.598 --> 01:09:49.393
You've used me
to gather information for your books!

01:09:49.519 --> 01:09:51.478
Lower your voice!

01:09:54.899 --> 01:09:56.525
Kurtzweil!

01:09:56.651 --> 01:10:02.989
You'd be shit out of luck if it wasn't for me.
I put my ass on the line for you.

01:10:03.116 --> 01:10:06.535
I just got chased
by two black helicopters!

01:10:06.661 --> 01:10:09.996
And why do you think
you're here talking to me?

01:10:10.123 --> 01:10:12.416
These people don't make mistakes.

01:11:08.806 --> 01:11:10.891
What's wrong?

01:11:12.351 --> 01:11:16.188
Salt Lake City, Utah.
Transfer effective immediately.

01:11:16.439 --> 01:11:20.692
I already gave Skinner
my letter of resignation.

01:11:20.818 --> 01:11:22.694
You can't quit now.

01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:27.574
I can, Mulder. I debated
whether to tell you in person...

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:30.160
We're on the verge here!

01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:34.164
You're on the verge.
Please don't do this to me.

01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:38.043
After all you've seen,
you can just walk away?

01:11:38.169 --> 01:11:40.754
I have. I did. It's done.

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:44.633
- I need you on this...
- You don't need me.

01:11:44.926 --> 01:11:48.053
You never have.
I've just held you back.

01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:54.434
I gotta go.

01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:02.776
If you wanna tell yourself that, you can.
But you're wrong.

01:12:02.902 --> 01:12:05.487
Why did they assign me to you?

01:12:05.613 --> 01:12:08.240
To debunk your work.
To shut you down.

01:12:08.366 --> 01:12:10.075
But you saved me!

01:12:10.201 --> 01:12:13.954
As frustrating as it's been sometimes,...

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:19.125
.. your strict rationalism and science
have saved me a thousand times over.

01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:21.336
You kept me honest.

01:12:22.463 --> 01:12:27.592
You made me a whole person.
I owe you everything.

01:12:28.886 --> 01:12:31.680
Scully, you owe me nothing.

01:12:36.227 --> 01:12:39.354
I don't know if I wanna do this alone.

01:12:42.108 --> 01:12:44.192
I don't even know if I can.

01:12:47.572 --> 01:12:49.948
And if I quit now, they win.

01:13:47.214 --> 01:13:48.715
Ow! Jesus!

01:13:48.841 --> 01:13:49.799
I'm sorry.

01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:52.344
No... Something stung me.

01:13:58.351 --> 01:14:00.852
Must've gotten in your shirt.

01:14:01.687 --> 01:14:02.729
Mulder,...

01:14:04.523 --> 01:14:05.941
.. something's wrong.

01:14:06.233 --> 01:14:07.525
What?

01:14:07.652 --> 01:14:13.031
- I'm having lancinating pain in my chest.
- What?

01:14:13.491 --> 01:14:14.741
Scully!

01:14:14.867 --> 01:14:21.331
My motor functions are being affected.
My... pulse is thready.

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:25.752
I have a funny taste in the back of my throat.

01:14:25.878 --> 01:14:29.798
- It must be anaphylactic shock.
- I have no allergy...

01:14:38.099 --> 01:14:42.143
This is Special Agent Fox Mulder.
I have an agent down!

01:14:42.979 --> 01:14:46.147
Can you hear me?
Can you say your name?

01:14:46.273 --> 01:14:52.612
She has constriction in the throat.
Let's get her in the van right away!

01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:58.118
She said she had a funny taste in her throat.
But she has no allergy to bee stings.

01:14:58.244 --> 01:15:00.954
The bee that stung her
might have been carrying a virus.

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:05.959
- Get on the radio. Tell them...
- Tell them it may have been carrying a virus!

01:15:06.085 --> 01:15:09.004
I wanna go with her.
What hospital? I...

01:15:09.588 --> 01:15:11.756
What hospital are you taking her to?

01:16:58.781 --> 01:17:00.949
- What are you doing?
- Reading his chart.

01:17:01.075 --> 01:17:03.743
- Put it down.
- When I'm ready.

01:17:03.869 --> 01:17:07.288
- I think he's coming out of it.
- He's coming to.

01:17:08.958 --> 01:17:10.500
Hey, Mulder.

01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:12.293
Mulder?

01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:15.922
Oh, my God...

01:17:18.425 --> 01:17:22.720
Cowardly Lion, Scarecrow, Toto.

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:28.518
What am I doin' here?

01:17:28.727 --> 01:17:33.106
- A bullet grazed your temporal plate.
- 3cms left and we'd be playing harps.

01:17:33.232 --> 01:17:35.733
You've been unconscious since you got here.

01:17:36.318 --> 01:17:37.402
Where's Scully?

01:17:37.528 --> 01:17:40.989
Your 911 call must have been intercepted.

01:17:41.407 --> 01:17:45.660
Scully had a reaction
to a honeybee we found in your hall.

01:17:45.786 --> 01:17:49.539
- I gotta get to her.
- You're staying right here.

01:17:49.665 --> 01:17:51.666
This goes back to Dallas.

01:17:51.792 --> 01:17:55.295
- Where is she? I'll find her.
- I don't know where she is.

01:17:55.421 --> 01:18:01.467
You leave here unprotected, how far
will you get? How far will they let you get?

01:18:01.594 --> 01:18:03.678
What can we do?

01:18:05.764 --> 01:18:07.599
You can strip Byers naked.

01:18:07.725 --> 01:18:08.850
What?

01:18:08.976 --> 01:18:11.769
I need your clothes.

01:18:40.841 --> 01:18:42.926
It's Mulder.

01:19:16.835 --> 01:19:19.712
Dr Kurtzweil? Dr Alvin Kurtzweil.

01:20:11.974 --> 01:20:13.516
Mr Mulder.

01:20:15.978 --> 01:20:18.396
What happened to Kurtzweil?

01:20:18.522 --> 01:20:21.274
He's come and gone.

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:23.151
Where's Scully?

01:20:23.277 --> 01:20:28.323
The location of Agent Scully
and the means to save her life.

01:20:28.449 --> 01:20:30.199
Please.

01:21:09.782 --> 01:21:11.699
What is it?

01:21:11.784 --> 01:21:15.328
A weak vaccine against the virus
Agent Scully has been infected with.

01:21:15.412 --> 01:21:18.623
It must be administered
within 96 hours.

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:21.667
That leaves you little time
to reach those coordinates.

01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:26.130
- You're lying.
- No.

01:21:26.215 --> 01:21:28.800
Though I have no means
to prove otherwise.

01:21:28.884 --> 01:21:31.427
The virus is extraterrestrial.

01:21:31.512 --> 01:21:36.265
We know very little about it except that it was
the original inhabitant ofthis planet.

01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:38.267
A virus.

01:21:38.352 --> 01:21:41.813
What is a virus
but a colonizing force...

01:21:41.897 --> 01:21:43.898
that cannot be defeated...

01:21:43.982 --> 01:21:48.528
living in a cave underground
until it mutates and attacks?

01:21:49.863 --> 01:21:52.782
This is what you've been
conspiring to conceal?

01:21:52.866 --> 01:21:56.661
- A disease?
- No, for God's sake. You've got it all backwards.

01:21:56.745 --> 01:21:59.413
AIDS, the Ebola virusâ€”

01:21:59.498 --> 01:22:01.916
on an evolutionary scale
they are newborns.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.878
This virus walked the planet
long before the dinosaurs.

01:22:05.963 --> 01:22:08.506
What do you mean "walked"?

01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:12.093
Your aliens, Agent Mulder,
your little green men...

01:22:12.177 --> 01:22:14.262
arrived here millions ofyears ago.

01:22:14.346 --> 01:22:17.265
Those that didn't leave
have been lying dormant underground...

01:22:17.349 --> 01:22:19.267
since the last ice age...

01:22:19.351 --> 01:22:21.769
in the form
ofan evolved pathogen...

01:22:21.854 --> 01:22:26.149
waiting to be reconstituted
by the alien race...

01:22:26.233 --> 01:22:28.776
when it comes
to colonize the planet...

01:22:28.861 --> 01:22:30.862
using us as hosts.

01:22:30.946 --> 01:22:33.281
Against this we have no defense.

01:22:33.365 --> 01:22:35.366
Nothing but a weak vaccine.

01:22:36.451 --> 01:22:38.536
Do you see why it was kept secret...

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:43.624
why even the best men, men like your father,
could not let the truth be known?

01:22:43.709 --> 01:22:47.128
Until Dallas, we believed the virus
would simply control us...

01:22:47.212 --> 01:22:50.715
that mass infection
would make us a slave race.

01:22:52.676 --> 01:22:55.344
Imagine our surprise
when they began to gestate.

01:22:56.889 --> 01:23:00.474
Mygroup has been working
cooperatively with the alien colonists...

01:23:00.559 --> 01:23:03.644
facilitating programs
like the one you saw...

01:23:03.729 --> 01:23:05.646
to give us access to the virus...

01:23:05.731 --> 01:23:09.066
in hope that we might be able
secretly to develop a cure.

01:23:10.569 --> 01:23:13.070
To save your own asses.

01:23:13.155 --> 01:23:15.323
Survival is the ultimate ideology.

01:23:15.407 --> 01:23:17.325
Your father wisely
refused to believe this.

01:23:17.409 --> 01:23:20.620
But he sacrificed my sister.
He let them take Samantha.

01:23:20.704 --> 01:23:24.999
Without a vaccination,
the only true survivors ofthe viral holocaust...

01:23:25.083 --> 01:23:28.586
will be those immune to itâ€”
human-alien clones.

01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:31.088
He allowedyoursister
to be abducted...

01:23:31.173 --> 01:23:34.008
to be taken to a cloning program
for one reason.

01:23:36.595 --> 01:23:39.013
So she would survive...

01:23:40.766 --> 01:23:42.725
as a genetic hybrid.

01:23:42.809 --> 01:23:46.687
Your father chose hope
over selfishness.

01:23:46.772 --> 01:23:49.523
Hope in the only future he hadâ€”
his children.

01:23:49.608 --> 01:23:53.653
His hope foryou was that you
would uncover the truth about the project.

01:23:53.737 --> 01:23:57.323
That you would stop it.
That you would fight the future.

01:24:02.079 --> 01:24:04.622
Why are you telling me this?

01:24:04.706 --> 01:24:07.416
For the sake of my own children.

01:24:07.501 --> 01:24:11.629
Once it's learned what I've told you,
my life will be over.

01:24:20.430 --> 01:24:22.473
Where's Dr. Kurtzweil?

01:24:26.812 --> 01:24:29.188
I'd like to get out ofthe car now.

01:24:30.774 --> 01:24:33.067
Stop the car!

01:24:33.151 --> 01:24:35.444
Driver.

01:24:56.008 --> 01:25:02.096
The men I work with will strongly protect
their stake in the inevitable future.

01:25:03.598 --> 01:25:09.103
I was ordered to kill Dr Kurtzweil.
As I was ordered to kill you.

01:25:14.776 --> 01:25:16.277
Trust no-one, Mr Mulder.

01:25:21.074 --> 01:25:22.450
Get out of the car.

01:25:25.412 --> 01:25:28.080
Why? The upholstery's already ruined.

01:25:28.206 --> 01:25:29.790
Get out of the car!

01:25:40.093 --> 01:25:42.636
You have precious little time.

01:25:42.763 --> 01:25:48.267
What I've given you,
the alien colonists don't yet know exists.

01:25:48.393 --> 01:25:51.812
That vaccine is the only defence
against the virus.

01:25:52.022 --> 01:25:55.107
Introducing it into an alien environment...

01:25:55.233 --> 01:26:00.821
.. may destroy the plans we have so
assiduously protected for the last 50 years.

01:26:00.947 --> 01:26:03.491
What do you mean, may?

01:26:03.617 --> 01:26:09.372
Find Agent Scully. Only then
will you realise the scope of the project.

01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:11.374
Go!

01:26:13.210 --> 01:26:15.336
Go now!

01:34:50.768 --> 01:34:51.810
Shit!

01:37:15.288 --> 01:37:19.124
Secure the station!
I want everyone else below.

01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:22.002
Arm yourselves.
We may have a breach.

01:37:37.101 --> 01:37:38.810
Let's go! Let's go!

01:38:20.728 --> 01:38:21.895
Scully?

01:38:36.410 --> 01:38:38.912
There's a contaminant in the system.

01:38:40.915 --> 01:38:43.291
Mulder has the vaccine.

01:39:03.771 --> 01:39:05.564
Breathe!

01:39:05.690 --> 01:39:07.107
Scully, can you breathe?

01:39:14.574 --> 01:39:16.158
Cold...

01:39:16.284 --> 01:39:18.869
- I'm cold...
- I'll get you out.

01:39:24.083 --> 01:39:27.627
Abandon your posts! Evacuate!

01:39:36.429 --> 01:39:40.056
- What's happened?
- It's all going to hell!

01:39:40.183 --> 01:39:42.184
- What about Mulder?
- He won't make it.

01:41:25.955 --> 01:41:28.039
We gotta keep movin'.

01:41:28.457 --> 01:41:29.416
Come on!

01:41:29.542 --> 01:41:31.918
I can't.

01:41:32.044 --> 01:41:34.129
Yeah, you can.

01:41:51.939 --> 01:41:54.774
Scully, grab that vent.

01:41:57.194 --> 01:41:59.946
Scully, grab the vent!

01:42:01.198 --> 01:42:03.491
Scully...

01:42:30.269 --> 01:42:31.353
Jeez, breathe!

01:42:37.818 --> 01:42:40.362
Breathe! Come on!

01:42:45.534 --> 01:42:47.660
Breathe in.

01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:50.789
Breathe in... Breathe!

01:42:52.208 --> 01:42:54.501
I had you big time.

01:43:10.851 --> 01:43:12.102
Pull!

01:43:12.228 --> 01:43:14.771
Come on, Scully! Pull!

01:43:17.358 --> 01:43:19.484
Mulder...

01:43:28.702 --> 01:43:30.078
Keep movin'!

01:43:35.876 --> 01:43:37.877
Go! Come on!

01:43:43.384 --> 01:43:46.010
Almost there. Keep going.

01:46:15.953 --> 01:46:17.912
You gotta see this.

01:46:18.038 --> 01:46:20.123
Scully!

01:48:01.141 --> 01:48:07.563
In light of your report and narrative,
my official report is incomplete,...

01:48:07.815 --> 01:48:10.900
.. pending these new facts
I'm being asked to reconcile.

01:48:11.026 --> 01:48:17.198
Though it seems that a federal agent
may have been involved in the bombing,...

01:48:17.324 --> 01:48:21.869
.. the other events you've laid down
are too incredible on their own...

01:48:21.995 --> 01:48:26.874
- .. and, quite frankly, implausible.
- What is it you find incredible?

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.751
Where should I start?

01:48:28.877 --> 01:48:33.923
So many of the events
described in your report defy belief.

01:48:34.049 --> 01:48:37.135
Antarctica is a long way from Dallas.

01:48:37.261 --> 01:48:42.932
I can't give the Attorney General a report
that alleges the links you've made here.

01:48:43.183 --> 01:48:48.604
Bees and corn crops
don't come under domestic terrorism.

01:48:49.148 --> 01:48:51.274
No, they don't.

01:48:52.568 --> 01:48:59.657
Your report doesn't show
any organisation with an attributable motive.

01:49:00.075 --> 01:49:05.121
I realise your ordeal affected you,
but the holes in your account...

01:49:05.247 --> 01:49:09.917
.. leave us with no choice
but to delete these references...

01:49:10.043 --> 01:49:17.884
.. until hard evidence becomes available that
could cause us to pursue an investigation.

01:49:39.698 --> 01:49:47.205
I don't believe the FBI has an investigative
unit qualified to pursue the evidence in hand.

01:50:28.330 --> 01:50:32.583
There's an interesting work of fiction
on page 24.

01:50:32.709 --> 01:50:35.878
Mysteriously,
our names have been omitted.

01:50:36.672 --> 01:50:41.884
They're burying it. They're gonna
dig a new hole and cover it up.

01:50:42.010 --> 01:50:45.137
I told OPR everything I know.

01:50:45.264 --> 01:50:51.978
What I experienced, the virus, how it's spread
by the bees and transgenic crops.

01:50:52.104 --> 01:50:53.646
They won't believe you.

01:50:53.897 --> 01:50:57.692
Not unless your story can be categorised
or easily referenced.

01:50:57.818 --> 01:51:00.236
- We'll go over their heads.
- No. No.

01:51:00.362 --> 01:51:03.239
How many times
have we been here before?

01:51:03.365 --> 01:51:06.075
Right here?
So close to the truth.

01:51:06.201 --> 01:51:09.745
And now,
to be back at the beginning with nothing!

01:51:09.872 --> 01:51:11.706
This is different.

01:51:11.832 --> 01:51:18.254
No, it isn't. You're right to want to quit. You
should get as far away from me as you can.

01:51:18.380 --> 01:51:21.632
You won't die
because of a hollow cause of mine!

01:51:21.758 --> 01:51:24.552
Go be a doctor.

01:51:24.678 --> 01:51:27.597
Go be a doctor while you still can.

01:51:30.642 --> 01:51:32.810
I can't. I won't.

01:51:32.936 --> 01:51:37.607
I'll be a doctor,
but my work is here with you now.

01:51:37.733 --> 01:51:40.401
That virus that I was exposed to,...

01:51:40.527 --> 01:51:46.532
.. whatever it is, it has a cure.
You held it in your hand.

01:51:49.286 --> 01:51:51.996
How many other lives can we save?

01:51:55.042 --> 01:51:56.918
Look,...

01:52:01.214 --> 01:52:04.884
.. if I quit now, they win.

01:52:59.189 --> 01:53:02.817
You look hot.
Why have you travelled all this way?

01:53:02.943 --> 01:53:04.819
We have business to discuss.

01:53:04.945 --> 01:53:09.824
- You have regular channels.
- This involves Mulder.

01:53:09.950 --> 01:53:14.203
- That name! Again and again.
- He's seen more than he should.

01:53:14.329 --> 01:53:17.999
Of the whole, he has seen but pieces.

01:53:18.125 --> 01:53:22.211
He's determined now. Reinvested.

01:53:25.757 --> 01:53:27.800
He's but one man.

01:53:28.552 --> 01:53:31.721
One man alone cannot fight the future.

01:53:32.472 --> 01:53:34.515
Yesterday...

01:53:34.766 --> 01:53:36.809
.. I received this.
