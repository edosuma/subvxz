00:02.200 --> 00:05.636
Turk's relationship is so messed up
I decided to lighten his mood.

00:05.720 --> 00:09.395
Nothing cracks him up more than
the block-the-door-with-my-foot gag.

00:11.640 --> 00:13.039
Oops, wrong person.

00:13.120 --> 00:15.588
- What happened?
- The door got stuck. Gotta go.

00:15.680 --> 00:18.478
Baby, you know how much I care
about you, right?

00:18.560 --> 00:20.869
- I'm dizzy.
- Yeah, you're fine.

00:20.960 --> 00:24.111
Honey, I know it looked really
bad last night with me and Kevin

00:24.200 --> 00:26.555
coming home liquored up
with a hot chick.

00:26.640 --> 00:30.110
Kevin was freaking out about
his divorce. I was being supportive.

00:30.200 --> 00:32.953
Yeah, by dragging home
some random bar skank?

00:33.040 --> 00:35.508
- Dude, you're not helping.
- Not trying to help.

00:37.120 --> 00:40.556
I have figured out why you're not ready
to marry me yet.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.437
You think I'm too immature.

00:42.520 --> 00:44.988
- It's not about that.
- Is it my sleep toots?

00:45.080 --> 00:47.799
Cos baby,
I will stop having dairy after six.

00:47.880 --> 00:50.155
I don't know what it is, Turk.

00:50.240 --> 00:53.118
Since you asked me,
all I wanted to do is say yes.

00:53.200 --> 00:56.829
It's just that every time I try to,
something stops me.

00:56.920 --> 00:59.115
You just have to be patient.

00:59.200 --> 01:01.555
Yeah, about that...

01:01.640 --> 01:05.553
So, he just said he was gonna
keep asking until I said yes.

01:05.640 --> 01:07.870
That is exactly how I lost my virginity.

01:07.960 --> 01:11.157
Except Turk didn't propose
in Jim Filliseti's crawl space.

01:12.880 --> 01:14.472
- Yes?
- Whoo-hoo! You said yes!

01:14.560 --> 01:16.915
- We're getting married.
- Stop celebrating.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.797
That's just how I answer the phone.

01:18.880 --> 01:21.348
It's only been ten minutes
since we last talked.

01:21.440 --> 01:24.273
Don't you hate it when people
yap away on their phones?

01:24.360 --> 01:26.237
She's my friend.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.675
But she is so rude.

01:28.760 --> 01:30.671
Don't you work at the hospital too?

01:30.760 --> 01:34.036
Yeah, I actually just got off
a double shift.

01:34.120 --> 01:37.635
- That's why I look so gross.
- Oh, you don't look gross.

01:37.720 --> 01:40.473
You know what,
you don't even think you look gross.

01:40.560 --> 01:44.838
You're one of those girls who uses
self-deprecation as a defence mechanism,

01:44.920 --> 01:49.198
even though, without looking, you can
tell how many guys are checking you out.

01:49.280 --> 01:52.795
- OK, five.
- No, actually, it's four.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.075
The guy in the mullet
is checking me out.

01:56.280 --> 01:58.157
I let him buy my last two drinks.

01:58.240 --> 02:00.470
Thanks again, cowboy.

02:03.400 --> 02:05.072
Back off.

02:06.200 --> 02:08.475
So what, you just gonna
keep on asking her?

02:08.560 --> 02:11.711
If you love somebody,
gotta be willing to break their spirit.

02:11.800 --> 02:13.631
Here you go, fellas.

02:13.720 --> 02:15.358
Thank you, Jenny.

02:15.440 --> 02:17.635
You're welcome.

02:17.720 --> 02:21.599
Yo, check out these fries.
That girl is so into me.

02:21.680 --> 02:23.830
Please, she's crushing on the brother.

02:23.920 --> 02:26.992
- Why, because you're black?
- Let's get one thing straight.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.640
This has nothing to do
with me being black.

02:29.720 --> 02:32.837
This has something
to do with me being smoother.

02:35.960 --> 02:39.839
Oh, here's a towel.
And here are your shakes.

02:39.920 --> 02:41.831
Thank you, Jenny. Hey, wait, Jenny.

02:41.920 --> 02:43.956
What flavour do you usually go for?

02:44.040 --> 02:47.271
Do you like chocolate or... vanilla?

02:47.360 --> 02:49.635
I'm a vanilla girl.

02:49.720 --> 02:52.029
I'll go get you some more towels.

02:52.120 --> 02:55.556
- Go ahead and say it.
- She gotjungle fever

02:55.640 --> 02:58.029
She gotjungle fever

02:59.480 --> 03:01.835
I had so much fun tonight.

03:01.920 --> 03:04.195
I hope I didn't talk
about myself too much?

03:04.280 --> 03:08.034
Hey, Elliot, I said I wanted
to know everything about you.

03:08.120 --> 03:10.270
And now I do.

03:10.360 --> 03:13.238
So listen, I'd like to take you out
tomorrow night.

03:13.320 --> 03:15.675
I don't wanna seem
like I'm rushing things...

03:17.720 --> 03:19.278
See you tomorrow.

03:19.360 --> 03:21.351
Oh, my God!

03:21.440 --> 03:23.237
What?

03:23.320 --> 03:26.392
I'm not big on public displays
of affection, that's all.

03:28.560 --> 03:29.879
Hit it.

03:31.240 --> 03:35.711
Carla Espinoza, will you marry me?

03:35.800 --> 03:37.791
Oh, my God.

03:37.880 --> 03:41.270
C'mon, citizens, let me hear you.

03:41.360 --> 03:44.352
Honk in the name of love.

03:45.800 --> 03:48.837
Honk for love! Honk for love!

03:50.000 --> 03:56.074

04:04.200 --> 04:06.156
I've gotta say, life is pretty good.

04:06.240 --> 04:09.391
I've hit my stride as a doctor,
all my patients are doing well,

04:09.480 --> 04:13.109
and I've finally figured out
that even though they're uncomfortable,

04:13.200 --> 04:15.998
my medium scrubs
have a large effect on the ladies.

04:16.079 --> 04:18.116
Yep, everyhing 's just great.

04:18.200 --> 04:21.555
For the first time since I started,
I have no stories to tell.

04:21.640 --> 04:24.837
Sometimes you know it's a crappy day
from the moment you wake.

04:24.920 --> 04:26.399
Today was one of those days.

04:28.840 --> 04:31.195
See, I have an appointment
to see my shrink,

04:31.280 --> 04:34.238
and it feels like there's
a little friction between us.

04:34.320 --> 04:36.151
You will not beat me.

04:36.240 --> 04:38.390
Listen, "Doctor",

04:38.480 --> 04:40.596
while we're on me just for a second,

04:40.680 --> 04:43.319
my very pregnant ex-wife
would like me to take

04:43.400 --> 04:46.073
a couple of days off
and travel to her mother's house

04:46.160 --> 04:47.878
so we can reconnect as a family.

04:47.960 --> 04:50.633
And I assume that you told her
to blow it out her ass.

04:50.720 --> 04:53.792
You get me! Darn it, you do!

04:53.880 --> 04:58.237
Yes, we're like two peas
in a horrible, horrible pod.

04:58.320 --> 05:02.472
Anyway, I invited a couple of my friends
over to the apartment while she's gone.

05:02.560 --> 05:04.790
Some beers, watch the game.
It'll be great.

05:04.880 --> 05:07.553
- And I was wondering if you...
- I'm not your friend.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.471
They're not either.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.551
So how's your rage going lately?

05:15.520 --> 05:17.078
Better.

05:17.160 --> 05:18.513
OK.

05:18.600 --> 05:22.229
Next time you feel anger welling up
in your meaty chest...

05:22.320 --> 05:23.719
Oh, give it to me.

05:23.800 --> 05:26.997
Take a deep breath
and count to ten before you react.

05:27.080 --> 05:29.116
Do you think you could do that, Perry?

05:29.200 --> 05:32.192
For the record, I'm not a child. OK?

05:32.280 --> 05:34.430
Dr Cox?

05:34.520 --> 05:36.988
I just wanted to tell you...
Well the thing is...

05:37.080 --> 05:39.992
One, two, ten.

05:40.080 --> 05:43.277
Finish the sentence in the next
two seconds or start running.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.315
Dear God,
you're actually frozen with fear.

05:47.400 --> 05:50.039
Don't worry about a thing.
I'll talk you through it.

05:50.120 --> 05:54.591
I want you to relax,
take a big breath, and now...

05:55.080 --> 05:57.230
Get outta here! Go, go, go, go, go.

05:57.320 --> 05:59.834
- Morning, Dr Cox.
- Gladys, Ginger, Tiffany, no.

05:59.920 --> 06:01.990
Cheryl, Betsy... Ooh, that's new.

06:02.080 --> 06:04.799
Betsy, good morning.
Let's make with the chop-chop.

06:04.880 --> 06:07.599
You already used Betsy,
like six months ago.

06:07.680 --> 06:11.036
- Dammit!
- Perry! How are you, etcetera?

06:11.120 --> 06:14.430
The wife and I took out a new
insurance policy. I need a physical.

06:14.520 --> 06:17.751
Bob, the day I willingly cradle
your dusty old twig and berries

06:17.840 --> 06:20.991
and get a whiff of your halitosis
while you turn and cough,

06:21.080 --> 06:23.913
is the day I'll be on the roof
singing I Believe I Can Fly.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.116
Great stuff. See you about two-ish.

06:27.840 --> 06:30.274
- You should just do it.
- Really?

06:30.360 --> 06:33.397
It'll take 1 5 minutes
and it wouldn't hurt to be in with him.

06:33.480 --> 06:36.517
- You're giving me advice?
- Feel free to return the favour.

06:36.600 --> 06:38.352
Fair enough. Try this on for size.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.590
No matter where you go in life,

06:40.680 --> 06:44.389
always keep an eye out for Johnny,
the tackling Alzheimer's patient.

06:45.400 --> 06:46.913
What's that supposed to mean?

06:47.000 --> 06:48.672
Who am l?

06:51.880 --> 06:55.429
Just run one of the other nurses
down here with some bedpans, please.

06:55.520 --> 06:57.033
Laverne, why can't you do it?

06:57.120 --> 06:59.588
I've been here for 23 years
and my feet hurt.

06:59.680 --> 07:00.999
After all I've done...

07:01.080 --> 07:03.913
Laverne, I am so excited
about this doctor I just met.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.309
He's nice and humble.

07:06.400 --> 07:09.278
I hate how so many doctors
are so self-centred, you know?

07:09.360 --> 07:12.796
- I know, girl. Yesterday...
- And he's cute, too.

07:12.880 --> 07:16.316
Hey, fresh bedpans here.
Get 'em before they're hot.

07:16.400 --> 07:22.270
- Dr Reid.
- Hey, Nurse... Paul.

07:22.360 --> 07:25.636
- It's Paul Flowers, actually.
- Flowers?

07:25.720 --> 07:27.551
Yep. Up you go.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.389
- Marry me?
- Still thinking.

07:36.480 --> 07:40.155
OK. Baby, I have figured out
what's bothering you.

07:40.240 --> 07:41.719
- Really?
- Yep!

07:41.800 --> 07:44.678
You think I haven't
played the field enough.

07:44.760 --> 07:48.548
I just wanted you to know, that I've had
a long, productive playing career,

07:48.640 --> 07:52.872
over which time I've slept
with many, many women.

07:53.880 --> 07:57.475
And by many, many women, I mean three.

07:57.560 --> 08:00.074
Take away two,
equals one and that's you.

08:01.600 --> 08:03.716
Marry me? No!

08:04.640 --> 08:08.076
Here's the deal. I want all of you guys
at my place tonight.

08:08.160 --> 08:11.470
Get there for 7:30. We'll have food,
booze, the whole nine yards.

08:11.560 --> 08:14.552
- Will there be prostitutes?
- No.

08:15.680 --> 08:16.669
Good.

08:19.440 --> 08:22.398
It's just a physical.
You can be cordial.

08:22.480 --> 08:23.754
What do you say there?

08:23.840 --> 08:26.229
How 'bout we do
just like you do with Enid?

08:26.320 --> 08:29.118
Close our eyes,
pretend we're with someone else

08:29.200 --> 08:30.997
and be done before Leno starts.

08:31.080 --> 08:33.832
Save the racket
for the tennis court, big guy.

08:33.919 --> 08:36.070
I took the liberty
of filling out the form.

08:36.159 --> 08:41.188
All you have to do is sign right below
where it says, "Fit as a 26-year-old."

08:41.280 --> 08:45.159
You're not suggesting I rubber-stamp
your insurance physical, are you?

08:45.240 --> 08:47.708
Just sign the damn form.

08:47.800 --> 08:50.075
Or you could take your shirt off
right now

08:50.160 --> 08:52.515
and be done with all this
in five minutes.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.273
I am not going to make this
uncomfortable for you.

08:55.360 --> 08:59.239
- Come on, I'm a professional.
- OK.

09:06.040 --> 09:08.474
Had to be done, Bob.
Continue, handsome.

09:15.400 --> 09:18.995
- How's it going?
- I just got my vertebrae fused.

09:21.600 --> 09:22.953
I've got nothing.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.156
Hey! Hold that elevator!

09:26.200 --> 09:29.351
I'm pressing the button.
It's not working.

09:29.440 --> 09:31.112
Hold it! Hey!

09:32.280 --> 09:33.952
Hold it!

09:50.880 --> 09:53.838
- Morning, ma'am.
- I can't move my head.

09:53.920 --> 09:56.036
So what?

09:59.240 --> 10:01.879
Carol, I cannot thank you enough.

10:02.600 --> 10:04.318
Is that Bengay?

10:04.400 --> 10:07.836
Come on, Elliot,
so Paul's a male nurse.

10:07.920 --> 10:10.798
You're big enough
not to let that bother you, right?

10:10.880 --> 10:13.155
I'm dating a murse.

10:13.240 --> 10:16.471
Better that than a mecretary.
Or a manicurist.

10:16.560 --> 10:18.312
- No, that works.
- It's no big deal.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.994
Only you guys know. And Nurse Roberts.

10:22.320 --> 10:25.596
She's not that much of a gossip!
Is she?

10:28.320 --> 10:30.436
Dr Reid, Nurse Paul.
Dr Reid, Nurse Paul.

10:30.520 --> 10:33.478
Dr Reid, Nurse Paul.
Dr Reid, Nurse Paul!

10:45.560 --> 10:48.438
We're talking about only six inches
and about 70 pounds,

10:48.520 --> 10:51.318
plus he's twice as fast
as the other guy.

10:51.400 --> 10:54.915
Dr Reid and Nurse Paul... dating.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.431
Giant, who cares?

10:57.520 --> 10:59.875
So see you fellas tonight,
what, around 7:30?

10:59.960 --> 11:01.837
Don't be late or you won't get a seat.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.309
- I'll bring the Fluffernutters.
- Newbie.

11:04.400 --> 11:07.153
I'd invite you.
Unfortunately, it's guys only.

11:07.240 --> 11:09.549
You and your damn physical.

11:09.640 --> 11:11.437
Thanks to my high blood pressure,

11:11.520 --> 11:15.069
my insurance premium will cost me
an extra six grand this year.

11:15.160 --> 11:17.799
That's six grand my wife
already spent on a new chin.

11:17.880 --> 11:20.599
If I were you,
I would plan to work every holiday

11:20.680 --> 11:23.956
from now until a few months
after you're dead.

11:25.840 --> 11:27.956
Newbie, this is your fault.

11:28.040 --> 11:29.598
Where is he?

11:29.680 --> 11:32.319
Where is that little rat bastard?

11:32.400 --> 11:34.197
Oh, hey, pal.

11:35.760 --> 11:38.274
I'll always remember our time together.

11:38.360 --> 11:39.634
Gotta go.

11:43.640 --> 11:45.551
- Marry me?
- Still thinking.

11:45.640 --> 11:48.200
I figured it out.
This is what you're afraid of.

11:48.280 --> 11:50.748
The typical surgeon.
A dumb, arrogant frat boy

11:50.840 --> 11:52.592
whose behaviour is so disgusting,

11:52.680 --> 11:55.638
it is embarrassing for a woman
to be seen with him.

11:55.720 --> 11:58.075
- No offence, buddy.
- None taken. I gotta run.

11:58.160 --> 12:01.516
They're doing a breast reduction
on three. I wanna try to stop it.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.636
You know what I'm talking about.

12:05.120 --> 12:07.350
- It's not The Todd.
- It's gotta be The Todd.

12:07.440 --> 12:09.078
Turk, will you stop?

12:09.160 --> 12:11.310
Yes, I've never been
a big fan of surgeons

12:11.400 --> 12:14.312
and, yes, I worry
about your maturity sometimes.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.879
I'm a worrier, it's what I do.

12:15.960 --> 12:19.191
But you have got to stop trying
to pinpoint what the reason is.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.872
Cos there's so many, right?

12:20.960 --> 12:24.748
I mean, you don't like who I am,
you don't like what I do.

12:24.840 --> 12:26.478
C'mon, I like the way

12:26.560 --> 12:28.710
I have to stand
on my tippy toes to kiss you.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.393
It's not enough.

12:35.480 --> 12:40.508
Hey, Elliot. I heard you got your
nursing degree in the male... nurse!

12:40.600 --> 12:42.716
What's up?!

12:44.520 --> 12:46.192
That's her. Don't look.

12:50.120 --> 12:51.633
Murse!

12:51.720 --> 12:53.631
Oh, my God.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.600
Whoa, Doctor!
Hey, I'm not that type of gal.

12:57.680 --> 13:01.036
Shut up, Paul.
You are a man and I am a woman.

13:01.120 --> 13:02.792
Hey, Elliot, are you OK?

13:05.600 --> 13:08.512
I got very drunk last night

13:08.600 --> 13:11.831
and I decided
that I'm not giving up on you.

13:11.920 --> 13:16.232
So, how'd you do
with my counting exercise?

13:16.320 --> 13:18.788
I tried it once
and I thought it was stupid.

13:18.880 --> 13:21.110
- That's it. We're done.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:21.200 --> 13:24.237
- You're dumping me?
- I hope we can remain friends.

13:24.320 --> 13:27.596
Now, please don't take away
the privilege of letting me pay you

13:27.680 --> 13:31.912
$200 an hour so I can drag my ass
in here and watch you nod.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.753
The only other place
I can get that on the planet

13:34.840 --> 13:36.910
is from my Brett Favre bobblehead doll.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.039
Fine, you wanna know
what I really think?

13:40.120 --> 13:42.270
Your problem isn't making bad choices.

13:42.360 --> 13:46.433
It's that you identify the good choice
and then intentionally do the opposite.

13:46.520 --> 13:49.637
You see,
behind this boorish bravado of yours

13:49.720 --> 13:53.235
is a paralysing fear
of letting anyone into your life.

13:53.320 --> 13:57.154
And it isn't because you weren't loved
when you were a kid.

13:57.240 --> 14:00.357
You're so egocentric
that the love wasn't enough.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.839
So you pulled pigtails

14:01.920 --> 14:04.309
and you pushed the fat kids
into the dirt

14:04.400 --> 14:07.631
so no one could ignore little Perry.

14:08.240 --> 14:11.550
Well, little Perry is now 40 years old

14:11.640 --> 14:14.757
and is so invested
in this narcissistic notion of yourself

14:14.840 --> 14:17.400
as "loner" that you can't quit.

14:17.480 --> 14:20.950
And you'll just keep dumping on
everyone around you

14:21.040 --> 14:25.238
until eventually,
and please, trust me on this,

14:25.320 --> 14:28.039
there won't be anyone left.

14:28.120 --> 14:31.829
There's a million reasons
a relationship can crash and burn.

14:36.040 --> 14:37.951
Give me a break.

14:40.120 --> 14:43.430
Whether it's because you don't
have the stones to make it work.

14:43.520 --> 14:47.308
Sorry, I have to... cancel tonight.

14:49.960 --> 14:53.430
Or you just get sick and tired
of jumping through hoops.

14:53.520 --> 14:55.556
OK. You win.

14:55.640 --> 14:59.599
All right, you don't have to worry about
me asking you over and over anymore.

15:02.520 --> 15:04.875
Eventually, everyone bails.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.153
Two bits.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.515
If it isn't my favourite
career counsellor.

15:11.600 --> 15:14.512
You don't have more tips
on how to climb down the ladder?

15:14.600 --> 15:17.672
I've been thinking about
how you blame me for everything

15:17.760 --> 15:20.752
and how you just send a constant stream
of crap my way,

15:20.840 --> 15:23.957
and... I decided I need a break.

15:24.040 --> 15:26.554
So you came by to tell me
you're a complete wuss?

15:26.640 --> 15:30.349
No, I came over here to tell you
I traded with another resident

15:30.440 --> 15:32.590
and switched off
your service for a while.

15:32.680 --> 15:34.716
Well, tears and hugs there, Katie,

15:34.800 --> 15:38.076
but unless you wanna come inside
and give the fellas a lap dance,

15:38.160 --> 15:39.718
I gotta say sayonara,

15:39.800 --> 15:42.394
cos I got 20 guys in here
and it's about to get nutty.

15:42.480 --> 15:44.232
All the best, baby.

16:01.880 --> 16:03.836
Turns out last night got in my head,

16:03.920 --> 16:05.911
so this morning I swallowed my pride

16:06.000 --> 16:07.991
and asked Dr Gross to take me back.

16:08.080 --> 16:10.548
I have a hammer in my desk.

16:10.640 --> 16:13.234
It did not go well.

16:13.320 --> 16:17.074
Dr Cox,
I was the one who switched with JD.

16:17.160 --> 16:19.879
Nervous Guy! How you feeling?

16:19.960 --> 16:21.916
- A little nervous.
- Oh, that's OK.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.753
Don't worry about a thing,
cos I'm gonna ease you in.

16:24.840 --> 16:28.469
You have eight seconds to find
this patient's chart or you're through.

16:28.560 --> 16:32.758
- Oh, God! Chart? Chart?
- You want me to look for it?

16:32.840 --> 16:36.355
- Has anyone seen the chart?
- I got the chart right here.

16:37.720 --> 16:40.075
- Cheer-up hug?
- What?

16:40.160 --> 16:41.639
When I was little and sad,

16:41.720 --> 16:44.553
my mom would always have the maid
give me a cheer-up hug.

16:44.640 --> 16:48.428
Further explaining your love
of the Latino people.

16:48.520 --> 16:52.513
Carla, whenever you need to talk.

16:52.600 --> 16:55.114
It's just I don't think
that Turk is being fair.

16:55.200 --> 16:58.988
He didn't get the answer he wanted when
he wanted it so now he's pushing...

17:00.560 --> 17:02.073
What do you want?

17:06.240 --> 17:07.559
OK, wait, wait, wait.

17:07.640 --> 17:10.473
Are you kissing me
because you want this to go somewhere

17:10.560 --> 17:14.189
or because you feel bad about
blowing me off yesterday?

17:14.280 --> 17:16.635
Actually, I don't care either way.

17:20.319 --> 17:22.470
I decided to bail on Cox
for a while, you know?

17:22.560 --> 17:25.836
He sees a shrink every day
and is still the biggest pain in my ass.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.512
Is he in group?

17:29.240 --> 17:32.152
Maybe it's not everybody else,
maybe it's you.

17:32.240 --> 17:33.673
- Yeah.
- Good sharing.

17:33.760 --> 17:35.955
- I see your point.
- That sounds right.

17:40.280 --> 17:42.714
- Anybody got anything else?
- Yeah, I got one.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.392
Come here.

17:44.480 --> 17:47.790
I don't think he'd do well in group.

17:47.880 --> 17:50.519
So what's up with Carla?

17:50.600 --> 17:54.798
I'm starting to think if she really
loved me, I'd know by now.

17:54.880 --> 17:56.677
Maybe it's time to retreat,

17:56.760 --> 17:59.797
protect myself
so I don't get hurt any worse.

17:59.880 --> 18:01.757
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Sure.

18:01.840 --> 18:05.719
- Here you go, fellas.
- Thank you, Jenny.

18:05.800 --> 18:10.715
- You're welcome.
- Eight strips of bacon.

18:10.800 --> 18:13.758
That girl is all about the J-Dizzle.

18:13.840 --> 18:15.990
Oh, yeah?

18:16.080 --> 18:19.993
- My God, it's Pancake Panda.
- That's what I'm talking about.

18:20.920 --> 18:23.229
Keep it together, pee-pants.

18:23.320 --> 18:27.199
You have six seconds to find
that soda you were holding for me.

18:28.680 --> 18:31.877
Has anyone seen a soda?
Oh, for the love of God.

18:31.960 --> 18:33.951
What is it there, Bobbo?

18:35.160 --> 18:36.752
I'm sorry.

18:39.360 --> 18:40.873
What did you say?

18:40.960 --> 18:42.791
I spoke to my cardiologist

18:42.880 --> 18:45.713
and he said if you hadn't caught
my high blood pressure,

18:45.800 --> 18:47.518
and it had continued unchecked,

18:47.600 --> 18:51.798
it might have resulted
in a mild case of... death.

18:52.920 --> 18:56.469
Must fight urge to rub it in his face.

18:56.560 --> 18:59.438
Anyway, I owe you one.

18:59.520 --> 19:03.877
Must rub something in someone's face.

19:05.360 --> 19:07.920
How's that coma
going for you there, pal?

19:08.000 --> 19:09.877
Much better.

19:12.640 --> 19:14.949
I bet you never
made out in there before.

19:17.520 --> 19:18.999
No, never.

19:20.480 --> 19:21.959
Come here.

19:22.040 --> 19:26.830
Nurse, I need clean sheets right away
to room one... thousand.

19:26.920 --> 19:30.037
She's covering because she's
embarrassed she likes a nurse

19:30.120 --> 19:32.236
and I really can't figure out why.

19:32.320 --> 19:34.880
That's because
you're doing a woman's job, son.

19:34.960 --> 19:37.269
Have a good one.

19:38.240 --> 19:40.879
Great. Why did you do that?

19:40.960 --> 19:45.078
You know, what I do for a living doesn't
make me feel like any less of a man.

19:45.160 --> 19:48.470
Neither does my love of baking
or gardening,

19:48.560 --> 19:50.630
or that I occasionally menstruate.

19:50.720 --> 19:53.188
- What?
- Elliot, lighten up.

19:53.280 --> 19:56.590
Stop worrying so much about
what everybody else thinks.

20:02.080 --> 20:04.071
Go ahead. I'll see you outside.

20:04.160 --> 20:05.354
OK.

20:06.720 --> 20:10.190
Boy, I gotta say, your wife is hotter
than I ever imagined.

20:12.960 --> 20:15.793
Hello, Perry.
You're obviously trying to bully me.

20:15.880 --> 20:18.440
But you can't bully me
because I don't fear you.

20:18.520 --> 20:21.830
- Now I'm leaving.
- Kelso asked me to give him a physical.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.070
He said thank you
and told me he owed me one.

20:24.960 --> 20:27.269
You actually made a decision

20:27.360 --> 20:30.158
that benefited you
personally and professionally?

20:30.240 --> 20:32.435
Well, a resident
kinda talked me into it.

20:32.520 --> 20:34.192
Come on. You're telling me

20:34.280 --> 20:37.477
that you took the advice
of another human being?

20:39.640 --> 20:42.552
- This is a great moment for me.
- Congratulations.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.551
Thank you.

20:44.640 --> 20:46.756
And, Perry,

20:46.840 --> 20:50.594
if there's someone at that hellhole
of a hospital you actually listen to,

20:50.680 --> 20:53.148
do everything in your power
to keep them around,

20:53.240 --> 20:56.550
because that person
is nothing short of a genius.

21:15.480 --> 21:17.357
Batcave.

21:17.440 --> 21:19.396
Hi, yeah, I'm stuck in the elevator.

21:19.480 --> 21:22.313
Yeah, I'm afraid
it might be a little while.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.072
Because you did this.

21:24.160 --> 21:27.152
Ah, no. I think we both know
you did this to yourself.

21:27.240 --> 21:28.992
Well, I'll let you go.

21:30.920 --> 21:32.831
Hello!

21:34.320 --> 21:36.550
Hey, Laverne,
have you seen Turk around?

21:36.640 --> 21:39.916
He's off today, honey.
How come you don't know that?

21:40.000 --> 21:41.911
I don't know.

21:43.080 --> 21:45.196
Everybody, I appreciate solidarity,

21:45.280 --> 21:47.669
but I did not blow off Paul
because he's a nurse.

21:47.760 --> 21:50.877
Stop leaving bedpans in my locker.
It makes me cry.

21:50.960 --> 21:53.599
Paul and I are just different, OK?

21:53.680 --> 21:55.989
Please, Elliot, this is not about Paul.

21:56.080 --> 21:57.672
This is about you.

21:57.760 --> 22:01.719
About you not being able to commit
because that means saying goodbye

22:01.800 --> 22:04.633
to whatever unfulfilled fantasy of love
you concocted

22:04.720 --> 22:06.676
after seeing too many Meg Ryan movies.

22:06.760 --> 22:09.957
But men don't make everything
all better. They're only human.

22:10.040 --> 22:12.315
Don't punish him
because you grew up so fast,

22:12.400 --> 22:14.630
you never let someone else
take care of you.

22:14.720 --> 22:18.315
He's not your father. He won't disappear
at the first sign of trouble.

22:18.400 --> 22:21.949
And as scary as it is being truly
vulnerable with another human being,

22:22.040 --> 22:26.591
what's even scarier is that deep down
inside you know you picked this man,

22:26.680 --> 22:28.511
and if you run away, you'll run away

22:28.600 --> 22:32.070
from being the kind of person
you always wanted to be.

22:34.200 --> 22:36.953
Carla, I just met the guy.

22:41.920 --> 22:44.115
All right, here we go, baby.
Here we go.

22:44.200 --> 22:46.395
Are you talking to that chilli dog?

22:46.480 --> 22:48.198
Hey.

22:48.280 --> 22:50.191
Yeah, well.

22:50.280 --> 22:55.229
I find that they don't repeat on me
as much if I'm real friendly to 'em.

22:56.440 --> 22:59.034
- What?
- Nothing.

22:59.120 --> 23:01.793
It's weird seeing you in the real world,
you know?

23:01.880 --> 23:04.599
I feel kinda guilty.
You're so nice to me and my buddy

23:04.680 --> 23:06.796
and we've never had a real conversation.

23:06.880 --> 23:10.429
We act like school kids and argue
over who we think you got a crush on.

23:10.520 --> 23:14.229
- It's totally you.
- What?

23:15.120 --> 23:17.475
Vanilla over chocolate? Please.

23:19.720 --> 23:22.109
In the event of a water landing.

23:22.200 --> 23:26.113
Yeah. Incoming. How you doing?

23:26.200 --> 23:28.919
Did you climb down an elevator shaft
to torment me?

23:29.000 --> 23:31.798
Sometimes in life,
you gotta do what you gotta do.

23:31.880 --> 23:35.873
Look, I promise you the Door Open button
was not working.

23:35.960 --> 23:37.916
No, it's OK.
We can work this thing out.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.992
Seriously, put your hands together
like you're praying.

23:44.600 --> 23:46.670
Hey, Dr Cox! Good to see ya.

23:46.760 --> 23:48.432
What the hell, he's a decent kid.

23:48.520 --> 23:51.557
Be a man and apologise to him
from the heart for once.

23:51.640 --> 23:54.359
For God's sake, Lily,
stop being such a complete wuss

23:54.440 --> 23:55.953
and come back to work with me.

23:56.040 --> 23:58.759
- Fine.
- Good.

23:58.840 --> 24:02.196
Give him a pat on the back.
He's wanted it since day one.

24:03.640 --> 24:05.790
Just do it.

24:06.480 --> 24:08.516
The second Dr Cox
patted me on the shoulder

24:08.600 --> 24:11.273
I thought about how
he always shows up just in time.

24:11.360 --> 24:12.475
I'll hang onto this.

24:12.560 --> 24:15.279
I guess in the end,
everyhing comes down to timing.

24:16.560 --> 24:19.120
Sometimes, you just have
one moment to seize it.

24:19.200 --> 24:20.713
Paul.

24:20.800 --> 24:23.633
I know that I've been acting
like an insecure idiot.

24:23.720 --> 24:27.030
If you'll forgive me,
I'd love to take you for dinner tonight.

24:27.120 --> 24:29.759
Screw that. I'll cook for you.

24:31.160 --> 24:35.199
I've only got one apron, though,
so bring your own if you wanna wear one.

24:37.760 --> 24:41.070
Oh, please.
You all wish you could bag a nurse.

24:41.160 --> 24:44.197
- She's right.
- Shut up, Zeltzer.

24:44.280 --> 24:46.111
You shut up.

24:46.200 --> 24:49.158
And ifyour timing is good
and it works out for you...

24:50.120 --> 24:52.714
...make sure you cherish it.

24:52.800 --> 24:55.758
Because bad timing
can mess up everyhing.

24:55.840 --> 24:58.638
You wanna grab a cup of coffee?

24:58.720 --> 24:59.914
I don't know.

25:01.480 --> 25:04.040
I'll let you talk to it
before you drink it.

25:05.920 --> 25:08.070
OK. We can get one cup of coffee.

25:08.160 --> 25:10.435
- Just one cup.
- One cup. Sure.

25:11.840 --> 25:15.150
Hold on one second.
Let me just answer this real quick.

25:15.240 --> 25:18.038
- Yeah, hello.
- Ask me again.

25:22.800 --> 25:25.394
Sorry, but I gotta go.
