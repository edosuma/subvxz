03:41.321 --> 03:42.961
Hear him ?

03:43.761 --> 03:45.121
- So what?
- "So what?"

03:48.321 --> 03:50.241
Why do you keep whistling ?

03:50.401 --> 03:53.161
- Sorry ?
- Why do you keep fucking whistling ?

03:53.361 --> 03:55.641
- That's my goddamn business.
- No, it's mine too.

03:55.921 --> 03:59.081
- He keeps whistling !
- Max, drop it, get back to work.

03:59.281 --> 04:01.361
He can't even whistle properly.

04:13.361 --> 04:15.441
- Hey, Riko.
- Hey.

04:20.401 --> 04:22.681
Your friend's a jerk.

04:22.841 --> 04:24.761
You're not so bad yourself.

04:24.921 --> 04:26.481
He's worse.

04:28.961 --> 04:30.921
- See you.
- Bye.

04:44.281 --> 04:47.001
<i>As for corruption
in the public service sector,</i>

04:47.161 --> 04:48.761
<i>we're bottom of the league.</i>

04:48.921 --> 04:54.201
<i>Italy is Europe's most corrupt country,
beaten only by Bulgaria.</i>

05:00.161 --> 05:03.521
The shower was freezing.
What's up with the boiler ?

05:12.441 --> 05:14.641
M
Everything you deserve

05:25.801 --> 05:27.961
Angela's invited us to dinner tomorrow.

05:29.761 --> 05:33.241
- Patrizio's bringing his new boyfriend.
- Someone texted you.

05:42.201 --> 05:44.281
"M" ?

05:44.441 --> 05:46.441
As in "matador" ?

05:46.601 --> 05:48.681
Or "motherfucking lover" ?

05:49.401 --> 05:52.081
- Save it with a fake female name.
- Don't look at my phone.

05:52.281 --> 05:54.761
- It was staring right at me.
- Don't ever do that again !

06:01.401 --> 06:04.641
I'm going to Milan on Monday,
I'm taking an afternoon for myself.

06:23.841 --> 06:27.201
A little louder,
they can't hear you in Palermo !

06:27.361 --> 06:30.801
These speakers are mine !
Do you want to blow them ?

06:33.241 --> 06:36.481
- You're still pilfering my records ?
- Sometimes.

06:37.121 --> 06:39.441
I was just finishing up...

06:39.641 --> 06:42.681
The footage I shot with the captions:
"How did I get here ?",

06:42.881 --> 06:45.521
"What am I doing here?"...
I'll make a short movie.

06:46.081 --> 06:49.321
Not about you, rockstar.
I'll shoot more material then edit it.

06:53.081 --> 06:55.681
What's up ?

06:55.961 --> 06:58.521
I've found a studio flat in the centre.

06:58.681 --> 07:00.121
What for ?

07:00.481 --> 07:02.721
I'm happy here, I can't
afford to pay rent.

07:03.001 --> 07:04.521
- Neither can you !
- We'll manage.

07:05.401 --> 07:07.441
You need to move on.

07:07.881 --> 07:09.081
You need to grow up.

07:09.241 --> 07:11.961
- Cut the apron strings.
- You've rowed with mum ?

07:12.241 --> 07:15.801
Leave her out of it.
I don't want you to settle for this.

07:16.041 --> 07:18.321
It's too easy to settle.

07:19.561 --> 07:21.881
It's too easy to settle ?

07:23.001 --> 07:24.281
What's wrong ?

07:26.441 --> 07:28.241
It's Friday.

07:44.921 --> 07:47.521
Everyone's an expert now, you see ?

07:47.681 --> 07:50.801
"Today it went up to 215".
215 what?

07:51.241 --> 07:53.281
"The spread !"

07:53.441 --> 07:55.281
The spread ?

07:58.241 --> 08:00.481
There's no smoking in my car.

08:01.721 --> 08:04.241
What? Since when ?

08:04.441 --> 08:05.881
Since I quit.

08:10.441 --> 08:13.281
What the fuck do I know anyway ?

08:13.481 --> 08:18.081
Instead I had to worry about him,
for the spread. Do you get me ?

08:23.121 --> 08:24.481
Is everything Okay 7

08:25.681 --> 08:27.801
Yes, can I call you back ?

08:28.881 --> 08:30.801
It's best I call you back.

08:31.201 --> 08:32.681
I will.

08:35.801 --> 08:38.921
- This calendar's five years old.
- Yes.

08:43.881 --> 08:47.241
Anyway, spreads, sacrifices,
various bullshit and then Copelli.

08:47.761 --> 08:49.521
- Copelli ?
- Punga.

08:49.721 --> 08:51.121
Oh, Punga.

08:51.281 --> 08:53.881
They fired him today.

08:54.041 --> 08:56.001
That's the third in under a month.

08:56.361 --> 08:59.681
I know... you don't care about the spread.

09:02.921 --> 09:05.401
- Where are we going ?
- To Baracca.

09:05.841 --> 09:08.081
Didn't it shut down ?

09:08.361 --> 09:10.481
- Do they still play rock music ?
- Yeah !

09:10.681 --> 09:12.841
Rock music... you wish !

09:20.321 --> 09:23.481
Won't they let you in ?
'Cause of your crap shoes ?

09:45.521 --> 09:47.161
On the train, dimwit!

09:58.761 --> 10:00.041
Here he is !

10:02.001 --> 10:05.201
This is Riko.
This is Carla, that's Miriam.

10:07.121 --> 10:09.001
Miriam's a beautician.

10:09.201 --> 10:11.601
Should you need her...

10:11.761 --> 10:15.961
Whereas Carla is my osteopath
and unofficially... she was my model.

10:16.681 --> 10:18.761
- What do you mean by "unofficially" ?
- Well...

10:19.921 --> 10:23.201
Whatever he's told you,
I've never done anything with him.

10:23.521 --> 10:25.881
I sat for free,
so drinks are on you tonight.

10:27.041 --> 10:30.321
- Have you been friends long ?
- Unfortunately, yes.

10:30.801 --> 10:33.681
So what's his real name ?
Why's he called Carnival ?

10:33.841 --> 10:38.161
Is that his surname ?
He signs his paintings with that name too.

10:38.321 --> 10:40.361
Does he look miserable ?

10:40.681 --> 10:44.281
- No.
- Doesn't he look like a carnival puppet?

10:45.081 --> 10:48.081
- Yes.
- Plus he's done jack shit all his life.

10:48.841 --> 10:50.401
Not bad, huh ?

10:53.681 --> 10:56.561
If you're having too much fun,
we'll tone things down.

10:58.761 --> 11:00.961
Miriam... a beautician...

11:01.121 --> 11:02.161
Right...

11:03.361 --> 11:04.601
Carla !

11:05.521 --> 11:08.361
- Am I interrupting ?
- No, we were waiting for you.

11:10.241 --> 11:14.921
I heard you liked young guys,
but this is going too far.

11:16.281 --> 11:18.481
<i>Mama, you've had your say,
you can go now.</i>

11:20.001 --> 11:23.001
Apart from the age thing,
isn't pulling someone's wife sleazy ?

11:23.441 --> 11:25.681
- You know she's my wife.
- Ex-wife.

11:25.841 --> 11:27.121
Now go away.

11:27.681 --> 11:31.921
Miriam, do you have the hots
for oldies too ?

11:33.361 --> 11:34.401
Fuck you !

11:34.841 --> 11:37.281
Did you study to be such an idiot?

11:39.441 --> 11:40.761
Carla, come with me.

11:41.561 --> 11:43.681
- Mattia, go away.
- Come back another day !

11:44.561 --> 11:45.681
Carla...

11:46.921 --> 11:50.241
Let's not make a scene.
You know you have to come anyway.

11:50.801 --> 11:52.001
Listen, Mattia.

11:52.361 --> 11:56.681
Maybe, just maybe
she doesn't want to talk to you.

11:57.241 --> 12:00.761
Why don't you just mind your own
goddamn business ?

12:05.521 --> 12:06.921
Fuck off.

12:08.721 --> 12:10.721
- "Fuck off" ?
- Yes.

12:11.401 --> 12:12.561
No!

12:19.201 --> 12:20.441
Put it away.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.081
Put it away, idiot.

12:23.241 --> 12:25.081
Come on, let's go.

12:46.081 --> 12:48.081
You didn't quit for long.

12:51.281 --> 12:53.201
Sorry, I messed up.

12:55.241 --> 12:57.481
I forgot to bring nappies !

13:00.321 --> 13:02.081
Choco-Riko !

13:02.241 --> 13:05.921
The super-hero ice-cream,
white on the top, brown in your pants !

13:10.281 --> 13:11.961
Shit, man...

13:12.241 --> 13:13.961
What nutters !

13:53.961 --> 13:55.281
Hi, Enea.

14:00.321 --> 14:01.601
How's it going ?

14:02.001 --> 14:04.321
Not good, stay away.

14:08.441 --> 14:09.921
Stay away.

14:10.081 --> 14:12.881
Do you remember this ?
The magnetic jacket.

14:14.401 --> 14:17.041
This'll attract them all, remember ?

14:17.201 --> 14:19.761
Let's do what we did last time.

14:25.841 --> 14:28.761
There, now they're all in here.

14:29.041 --> 14:30.961
You're clean.

14:31.121 --> 14:33.361
I'll get rid of them okay ?

14:33.961 --> 14:35.521
Bye, Enea.

14:39.561 --> 14:43.041
You didn't do military service, Alle,
I'll tell you the quartermaster story.

14:43.201 --> 14:46.601
- No, please !
- The army quartermaster was the guy

14:46.801 --> 14:50.761
who worked in the office and decided
who would be on guard duty.

14:50.921 --> 14:52.801
You had to take turns.

14:53.161 --> 14:56.481
Of course, there were those
who hassled him:

14:56.761 --> 14:59.561
"Don't put me on duty,
why does it have to be me..."

14:59.721 --> 15:03.001
They'd complain, insist,
and at times make threats,

15:03.161 --> 15:07.641
so to shut them up, the quartermaster
would put someone on duty

15:07.841 --> 15:09.801
who didn't deserve it

15:10.281 --> 15:13.441
and whose only crime
was that of toeing the line.

15:13.721 --> 15:17.281
The quartermaster's law is
the same law this country's based on:

15:18.441 --> 15:21.561
those who moan, break the law,
and put the pressure on,

15:21.841 --> 15:25.841
dodge guard duty but instead
send, in their place,

15:26.041 --> 15:29.041
those who do their duty in silence.

15:29.681 --> 15:32.801
That's his piece de resistance
when he meets someone new.

15:32.961 --> 15:34.361
Because he was a quartermaster.

15:34.561 --> 15:36.481
And he Still is.

15:37.641 --> 15:39.761
Is this Lebanese food, Angela ?
It's delicious.

15:39.961 --> 15:42.721
Do you like it? I'm glad.

15:42.921 --> 15:45.401
We like to eat ethnic food !

15:45.601 --> 15:48.241
Last time she cooked Italian food
I was in middle school.

15:48.441 --> 15:50.641
- Idiot !
- Meaning last year...

15:50.801 --> 15:52.321
He resat his exams several times.

15:53.721 --> 15:57.521
- Alle, what do you do ?
- My partners and I run a gym.

15:58.641 --> 16:02.201
- Is business good ?
- He's fishing for clients, how sad.

16:03.161 --> 16:06.601
Patrizio told me you're an accountant,
business is great, thanks.

16:06.761 --> 16:09.481
- And Angela, you're a teacher ?
- Yes, at the Marconi School.

16:09.681 --> 16:11.561
- A high school.
- Great, what about you ?

16:11.721 --> 16:16.041
- I work in car insurance.
- I live it up among pigs.

16:17.401 --> 16:19.681
He works at the Veroni salami factory.

16:20.361 --> 16:22.801
I watch him living it up with the pigs.

16:23.001 --> 16:26.841
- I told him they were jerks.
- He works at the salami factory too.

16:27.041 --> 16:30.161
- Hairdresser, I run a salon with a friend.
- And so...

16:30.961 --> 16:34.521
Just so I know, if I call you a faggot,
do you mind ?

16:39.001 --> 16:42.081
- Yes.
- Good man ! I like your attitude !

16:43.921 --> 16:46.801
Not like him, he calls himself a faggot
by himself.

16:47.001 --> 16:51.161
- Just think, I have to live with him.
- I'll switch him off, if you like.

16:51.361 --> 16:53.561
One more thing. Sorry...

16:53.721 --> 16:55.561
I always get to ask this.

16:55.761 --> 16:58.601
Will you be with him for
a month at least ?

16:58.801 --> 17:01.321
Because we grow fond of people easily.

17:01.841 --> 17:06.080
And we've already grown fond of
around 50, before you...

17:07.761 --> 17:11.521
- That's not true !
- I can dismantle him, if you like.

17:11.681 --> 17:15.921
- One last thing...
- I'll say it, we all know what it is.

17:16.080 --> 17:19.161
Don't worry about them,
they look coked up to the eyeballs.

17:19.761 --> 17:23.201
Due to their exuberance.
But they're not, they wake up like this.

17:42.241 --> 17:45.001
Enjoy your evening with wifey.
A real shag party I bet !

18:44.281 --> 18:46.281
- What do you want?
- Rebecchi too now ?

18:46.441 --> 18:48.321
Enough, for god's sake ! Stop !

18:48.481 --> 18:51.081
You're telling me ? It's not up to me !

18:55.721 --> 18:58.241
What's on the menu today... rat?

18:59.841 --> 19:02.681
Rat stew, roast rat...

19:03.681 --> 19:05.721
caramelised rat...

19:06.681 --> 19:08.721
Rebbo... I'm sorry.

19:19.521 --> 19:21.441
Gianluca's next.

19:28.961 --> 19:32.401
It's official: everyone's
screwing everyone in here.

19:34.641 --> 19:36.681
Up for our Monday card game later ?

19:44.001 --> 19:46.081
Up for a card game later ?

19:48.201 --> 19:50.041
It's great fun eating with you.

19:50.201 --> 19:54.361
All morning I thought: "I'll sit
with Riko at lunch, it'll make my day".

20:08.681 --> 20:10.681
Look at our dear Sara...

20:15.161 --> 20:16.841
<i>How did I get here ?</i>

20:20.041 --> 20:22.281
My life story in two minutes ?

20:24.641 --> 20:26.001
No.

20:28.401 --> 20:29.721
No.

20:34.921 --> 20:37.081
What am I doing here ?

20:41.961 --> 20:43.481
My share.

20:53.121 --> 20:55.921
There must have been a contest today

20:56.081 --> 20:59.921
where the biggest assholes
won a chance to bust my ass.

21:00.721 --> 21:02.561
All on a Monday ?

21:02.761 --> 21:04.761
Couldn't they spread themselves out?

21:05.881 --> 21:08.401
Always the last to arrive, Riko !
Always...

21:09.321 --> 21:10.921
Pussy detector.

21:12.601 --> 21:13.841
No, he came straight here.

21:14.121 --> 21:17.201
No diversions before coming here,
Mr Tirelli ?

21:17.681 --> 21:18.961
No.

21:19.641 --> 21:21.921
Okay, me and Carnival against
the two shits.

21:22.081 --> 21:24.121
Two shits who will thrash you.

21:24.561 --> 21:27.201
Five euros per game.
We'll play to 51.

21:27.361 --> 21:29.481
Last round is at eleven thirty.

21:31.321 --> 21:33.801
Seven, plus one, two, three coins.

21:35.721 --> 21:36.841
I win.

21:38.761 --> 21:41.921
- You're playing three against one ?
- I can't leave the seven there !

21:46.601 --> 21:50.041
- Whenever you're ready...
- What's the rush ?

21:50.241 --> 21:52.081
Rush, my ass !
Your turn.

21:52.441 --> 21:54.201
I wanted to enjoy the moment...

21:54.521 --> 21:56.801
<i>All the sevens ! All the sevens !</i>

21:56.961 --> 21:58.441
<i>All the sevens for me !</i>

22:37.961 --> 22:40.521
You're still here ? Go home.

22:41.681 --> 22:44.201
Your shift starts in six hours.

22:49.521 --> 22:51.321
What's wrong ?

22:53.041 --> 22:54.561
Home...

22:56.001 --> 22:59.921
- Do you ever think about my home ?
- That's all I think about.

23:04.841 --> 23:06.841
My grandpa built it...

23:07.561 --> 23:09.841
my father made it bigger...

23:10.561 --> 23:13.361
and I'm the one who can't afford it.

23:13.921 --> 23:16.001
The one who has to sell it.

23:17.201 --> 23:19.361
Only no one wants to buy it,

23:19.521 --> 23:21.561
our family home, do you see ?

23:21.721 --> 23:24.001
I can see that you're drunk.

23:36.801 --> 23:38.801
Sara's having an affair.

23:44.881 --> 23:46.761
So are you.

23:49.361 --> 23:51.521
You know Sara.

23:52.001 --> 23:54.601
- You know what this means to her.
- Yes...

23:54.801 --> 23:57.321
that she's in the wrong but you're not.

23:57.801 --> 24:00.161
You keep saying you can't stand her.

24:00.561 --> 24:02.641
Do you even know what you want?

24:06.961 --> 24:08.241
What I want...

24:10.281 --> 24:12.681
I have this little voice that...

24:12.841 --> 24:14.921
keeps going round in my head.

24:15.081 --> 24:16.641
All the time.

24:17.561 --> 24:21.121
I want her to stop treating me like
a fool, that's what I want.

24:21.841 --> 24:25.281
I've been there... for a lifetime...

24:25.481 --> 24:29.241
with a condom on my head,
stuffing sausages and I think:

24:29.401 --> 24:31.401
"Is this what I am ?"

24:31.801 --> 24:32.921
"Is this me ?"

24:33.601 --> 24:36.761
And the little voice says:
"Things'll get better".

24:38.361 --> 24:40.281
The house is falling to bits.

24:40.441 --> 24:44.281
That pig-headed son of mine...
"Things'll get better".

24:45.281 --> 24:48.121
Italy's gone to the dogs.

24:48.761 --> 24:51.801
The world's a shithole...
"Things'll get better".

24:51.961 --> 24:55.121
Listen, I can't fucking stand
whingers

24:55.321 --> 24:58.321
and you've just won first, second
and third prize as one.

24:58.961 --> 25:02.361
Get the fuck out of here.
I don't mean now... that too, if you want.

25:02.521 --> 25:05.441
I mean in general,
get the fuck out of here.

25:05.601 --> 25:08.721
Change city, job, family...

25:09.521 --> 25:12.521
But above all, please, change friends.

25:12.681 --> 25:15.961
Make a change instead of waiting for one.

25:19.121 --> 25:22.601
- Maybe I should change friends.
- Great idea, starting from now.

25:23.081 --> 25:24.481
Goodnight !

25:27.361 --> 25:28.641
Wait...

25:30.041 --> 25:31.361
May I?

25:31.961 --> 25:33.161
Go on.

25:46.961 --> 25:48.561
They're great.

25:49.041 --> 25:51.241
They're not bad.

25:52.561 --> 25:54.801
Who's the model...?

25:54.961 --> 25:56.681
Just a model.

26:01.921 --> 26:04.001
You're getting better and better.

26:04.601 --> 26:07.681
And you don't have the slightest clue.
Off to bed.

26:10.001 --> 26:11.841
Shall I drive you home ?

26:12.721 --> 26:16.561
If you get pulled over,
they'll take your license and smoke it.

26:16.721 --> 26:18.201
See you.

26:18.361 --> 26:20.881
And anyway, Italy's not gone to the dogs.

26:21.281 --> 26:23.281
And the world isn't a shithole.

26:23.441 --> 26:25.961
It's wonderful, you idiot !

26:45.521 --> 26:47.921
Don't come round.
Claudio's staying the night...

27:21.121 --> 27:22.481
Hi.

27:24.081 --> 27:26.081
Where's the pussy ?

27:26.281 --> 27:27.841
How are you ?

27:28.481 --> 27:30.721
Do you get any pussy ?

27:32.161 --> 27:34.081
Have you had lunch ?

27:37.561 --> 27:39.721
I'm Riccardo, dad !

27:41.321 --> 27:43.601
You're sweating, are you hot?

27:44.321 --> 27:46.721
Will you call Rosanna for me ?

27:47.121 --> 27:49.201
She's gone, dad.

27:49.361 --> 27:51.841
Mum's gone.

27:52.001 --> 27:53.401
When's she coming ?

27:55.041 --> 27:56.961
I'll call her later.

27:58.161 --> 28:00.121
What day is today ?

28:00.681 --> 28:02.481
Wednesday.

28:02.801 --> 28:06.361
- You go after pussy on Wednesdays ?
- No, I visit you.

28:10.561 --> 28:12.241
How's Pietro ?

28:12.801 --> 28:14.401
Pietro's fine.

28:15.161 --> 28:17.241
He's found a girlfriend, apparently.

28:17.681 --> 28:19.641
What about Antonio ?

28:20.401 --> 28:21.721
Antonio ?

28:26.161 --> 28:27.921
Who's Antonio ?

28:29.481 --> 28:30.681
Antonio...

28:34.001 --> 28:35.161
Dad.

28:36.601 --> 28:37.961
Giovanni?

28:39.401 --> 28:40.761
Dad !

28:46.121 --> 28:48.241
You do it on purpose, right?

28:49.281 --> 28:51.121
You're pretending.

28:51.761 --> 28:54.321
So everyone leaves you alone.

28:55.481 --> 28:57.361
Right, dad '2

29:06.801 --> 29:07.841
Yes.

29:10.121 --> 29:12.921
The chicken's good.
It's tastes like fish !

29:13.081 --> 29:15.441
Maybe if they cook fish,
it'll taste like chicken.

29:15.801 --> 29:19.241
- We're going to Rome on Tuesday.
- Are you off your head ?

29:20.401 --> 29:23.361
- Who's "we" ?
- Me, you and Carnival.

29:23.521 --> 29:27.121
- What's Carnival got to do with it ?
- He needs to come too.

29:28.001 --> 29:29.601
- Does he know ?
- I'll tell him.

29:29.921 --> 29:33.121
- What about me ? Did you ask me ?
- There's no need.

29:35.201 --> 29:37.201
There's no need.

29:48.881 --> 29:51.161
Carnival ! Mauro !

30:02.401 --> 30:04.161
Are you okay ?

30:07.121 --> 30:09.201
Enough now, okay ?

30:09.921 --> 30:11.681
Enough, I mean it.

30:30.841 --> 30:34.721
The night before... we're here now
and it's the night before. What now ?

30:35.201 --> 30:39.041
If this is a babe hunt, count me out.
Firstly, because I'm faithful.

30:39.201 --> 30:42.601
Secondly, because I always get the dogs.

30:47.201 --> 30:52.281
Have you ever heard of an Italian being
a tourist in Rome in the past 20 years ?

30:53.001 --> 30:55.241
No, it's our turn then.

30:55.761 --> 30:57.401
In a car ? No.

30:57.681 --> 30:59.601
On foot. Almost.

31:01.481 --> 31:03.241
- Almost.
- Almost.

31:05.801 --> 31:07.521
Hi, Daniele.
Thanks a million.

31:07.681 --> 31:08.801
Voilà !

31:10.601 --> 31:13.921
Cool, huh ?
It doesn't even have brakes.

31:14.081 --> 31:15.401
Shit!

31:15.961 --> 31:17.641
- Where's he going ?
- Out of the way !

31:23.841 --> 31:25.001
Shitheads.

31:25.281 --> 31:27.201
You're total shitheads.

31:28.281 --> 31:29.481
What's so fucking funny ?

31:48.961 --> 31:50.321
Thanks, Giulio, really.

31:50.601 --> 31:52.721
- No problem. Behave.
- Don't worry.

31:52.881 --> 31:55.001
Guys, we've got half an hour,
come on.

31:57.121 --> 31:58.161
Thanks.

32:02.121 --> 32:05.241
- What did you tell him ?
- That you had two months to live.

32:05.881 --> 32:07.241
You bastard !

32:07.401 --> 32:09.281
You wanted to come here, right ?

34:12.761 --> 34:15.201
I could do with a new back !

34:17.801 --> 34:19.880
Cool, huh ?

34:20.321 --> 34:22.400
A breath-taking view.

34:29.400 --> 34:30.641
No?

34:32.561 --> 34:34.601
Is he worse than usual ?

34:37.440 --> 34:39.360
So, what shall we do ?

34:41.400 --> 34:43.001
Good question.

34:45.481 --> 34:47.521
Good morning, partners in crime !

34:48.440 --> 34:51.761
I'm fine with "partner",
not sure about the "crime" though.

34:52.601 --> 34:54.081
Are we ready ?

34:54.241 --> 34:55.440
Shall we go ?

34:56.281 --> 34:58.721
Riko, are you sure ?

34:58.881 --> 35:00.361
Yes, yes...

35:00.761 --> 35:02.921
Going or not makes no difference.

35:04.641 --> 35:07.401
I'm not talking to you,
but to my co-worker.

35:07.881 --> 35:10.241
What are we going to do
down there, Riko ?

35:11.521 --> 35:13.641
Something needs to be done.

35:14.841 --> 35:17.161
Something needs to be done.

35:31.761 --> 35:34.561
Hands off! Hands off!

35:36.441 --> 35:38.681
Hands off! Hands off!

35:38.841 --> 35:41.081
<i>Hands off Article 18 !</i>

35:41.241 --> 35:43.281
Hands off! Hands off!

35:43.441 --> 35:45.161
<i>Hands off Article 18 !</i>

35:45.641 --> 35:47.841
Hands off! Hands off!

35:48.001 --> 35:50.241
<i>Hands off Article 18 !</i>

35:50.401 --> 35:51.401
Hands off!

35:51.961 --> 35:55.401
<i>This is a planned demonstration,
we have the right to protest.</i>

35:55.601 --> 35:58.321
<i>Make way !
We need to join the main protest.</i>

35:58.681 --> 36:01.641
Police, go away !
Police, go away !

36:01.801 --> 36:04.121
- Let us through <i>!</i>
- Police, go away !

36:04.561 --> 36:06.081
Police, go away !

36:06.281 --> 36:08.401
<i>Stop, be quiet !
Stop !</i>

36:08.601 --> 36:09.961
<i>Let us through !</i>

36:10.121 --> 36:13.201
<i>Make way !
We need to join the main protest.</i>

36:13.681 --> 36:15.761
<i>We're allowed to protest !</i>

36:16.521 --> 36:17.601
What the fuck are you doing ?

36:17.761 --> 36:19.401
- They'll attack us !
- They sure will now!

36:19.561 --> 36:22.281
Stand over there and don't move !

36:24.481 --> 36:26.961
<i>You have no right to stop us !</i>

37:04.041 --> 37:06.801
A 20-minute queue for coffee.

37:07.321 --> 37:09.761
I can't believe I'm your nurse now.

37:12.681 --> 37:15.041
Well... cheers, then.

37:21.041 --> 37:23.281
Max Lionheart says hi.

37:23.441 --> 37:25.561
See how shit scared he was ?

37:30.841 --> 37:32.641
Get back to bed.

37:39.481 --> 37:42.921
I don't need to hold your hand,
you're in better shape than me.

37:43.121 --> 37:46.681
I've had my coffee, so I'll scoot off.

37:47.681 --> 37:49.961
- There, perfect timing.
- Hi.

37:50.561 --> 37:52.161
Hi.

38:00.001 --> 38:02.001
I've brought you some clothes.

38:03.041 --> 38:05.881
He's still in one piece, he's all yours.

38:06.521 --> 38:07.721
I'll be off.

38:13.041 --> 38:13.961
Thanks.

38:14.161 --> 38:16.601
A whack on the head
did him good.

38:18.481 --> 38:19.761
Bye.

38:23.001 --> 38:24.321
Shall I put it there ?

38:24.481 --> 38:25.481
Yes.

38:27.681 --> 38:29.041
Well...

38:29.201 --> 38:31.641
I spoke to the doctor...

38:31.801 --> 38:34.401
You were lucky, it's nothing serious.

38:35.521 --> 38:38.441
They just want to keep you here
to be safe.

38:42.361 --> 38:43.681
Oh, yes... Pietro.

38:43.841 --> 38:46.681
He knows you're fine,
but wants to see you. Okay ?

38:46.841 --> 38:48.041
Yes.

38:51.281 --> 38:52.681
Here, wait...

38:53.441 --> 38:55.561
<i>- Hi.</i>
- Hi.

38:55.721 --> 38:57.561
- Here he is.
<i>- Well?</i>

38:57.761 --> 39:01.001
<i>It was your first protest
and you end up in hospital?</i>

39:01.161 --> 39:04.721
It wasn't the first,
you just hadn't been born yet.

39:04.881 --> 39:06.801
<i>You wanna be a rockstar, huh ?</i>

39:06.961 --> 39:10.881
<i>The video of you getting truncheoned
has had a billion views.</i>

39:11.041 --> 39:14.081
<i>By the way, some newspapers
want to interview you.</i>

39:14.641 --> 39:16.361
<i>What shall I tell them ?</i>

39:16.521 --> 39:18.521
<i>Have a think then let me know.</i>

39:18.961 --> 39:21.041
<i>Well, you guys look happy.</i>

39:21.921 --> 39:24.481
<i>Spend a few days in Rome
and have a riot.</i>

39:25.081 --> 39:27.521
<i>Oh God, "have a riot"...
What a horrible thought !</i>

39:28.041 --> 39:29.641
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>

39:38.881 --> 39:40.921
If there's nothing you need, I'll go.

39:41.841 --> 39:44.681
After all... you're in good hands.

39:45.201 --> 39:47.881
The doctor... she's a good-looking lady.

39:50.521 --> 39:52.481
Well, see you tomorrow.

39:52.641 --> 39:54.601
You don't need to come.

39:54.761 --> 39:58.481
I'm staying in a hotel nearby,
so I can be here for a few days.

39:59.841 --> 40:02.441
Maybe we'll go back together.

40:02.641 --> 40:04.761
I mean... we'll go home together.

40:06.161 --> 40:08.321
Well, bye.

40:41.361 --> 40:42.881
That was Angela.

40:43.041 --> 40:47.121
They wanted to come to Rome to visit you,
but I told her we're leaving.

40:47.281 --> 40:50.961
Here you are !
Some journalists want to see you.

40:51.361 --> 40:55.401
They know you're getting discharged so...
shall I send them up ?

40:55.801 --> 40:59.321
I suggest you see them today,
or tomorrow it'll be worse.

41:04.561 --> 41:08.161
The images you've just seen
have gone viral.

41:08.321 --> 41:11.841
During Tuesday's clashes a protester
was hit by a policeman

41:12.001 --> 41:14.601
with a truncheon, causing a gash
on his forehead.

41:14.761 --> 41:18.481
We're at the hospital where this protester
is being treated.

41:18.641 --> 41:22.521
Luckily, he's out of danger
and he's here with us: Riccardo Tirelli.

41:23.281 --> 41:25.561
So, Riccardo, you...

41:25.761 --> 41:28.561
and many others like you,
came to Rome

41:28.721 --> 41:31.681
to exercise your right
to stand up for your rights.

41:32.681 --> 41:35.201
It was a peaceful protest

41:35.361 --> 41:38.641
and then, suddenly, you were attacked.

41:39.521 --> 41:42.921
Actually, I didn't even make it
as far as the protest.

41:43.081 --> 41:45.241
- And we weren't attacked.
- So...

41:45.721 --> 41:48.161
Tell us what happened.

41:48.601 --> 41:50.041
Well...

41:50.201 --> 41:53.241
Me and two friends of mine
got caught up in a group

41:53.401 --> 41:56.241
that was trying to join the protest.

41:56.401 --> 41:59.561
They were already hyped up,
with megaphones, chanting...

41:59.721 --> 42:02.001
A sort of spontaneous fringe gathering.

42:02.161 --> 42:03.721
More or less...

42:03.881 --> 42:08.481
The street was being blocked
by a group of policemen.

42:09.161 --> 42:13.041
- Insults started flying...
- And that's when you were attacked.

42:14.121 --> 42:16.401
We were the ones who attacked.

42:18.801 --> 42:20.961
It's the game of roles.

42:22.161 --> 42:24.521
Every day you get mad
and you suck it up.

42:25.121 --> 42:28.641
You get mad and you suck it up.
You resist and resist, until one day...

42:28.801 --> 42:31.961
you either blow your top
or take it out on someone.

42:32.601 --> 42:35.001
None of us wanted to take it out
on the police.

42:35.841 --> 42:38.121
- But they were sent there.
- And then ?

42:39.361 --> 42:43.441
And then you go back to making
salami for 1,200 euros a month,

42:43.601 --> 42:45.681
after 30 years in the same job,

42:45.841 --> 42:48.241
to seeing your retirement age
get further away,

42:48.921 --> 42:52.921
to having your house robbed of
the few things you own every 5 years,

42:53.681 --> 42:55.801
to praying that you or your family
don't get sick

42:56.001 --> 42:58.921
'cause you'll wait 8 months
for a scan.

42:59.201 --> 43:02.041
In a few months,
my son's starting a Drama degree.

43:04.761 --> 43:07.521
He's the first in the family
to go to uni.

43:08.321 --> 43:11.881
For some reason, he's fond
of the area where he grew up.

43:13.241 --> 43:15.561
What's the likelihood of him staying there

43:15.721 --> 43:20.081
or joining the hundred thousand
people who emigrate every year ?

43:21.641 --> 43:24.361
The images are very gory,

43:24.521 --> 43:27.121
they show that you lost a lot of blood

43:27.361 --> 43:29.641
and that you fainted after you were hit.

43:29.801 --> 43:31.881
But what I want to ask you is:

43:32.041 --> 43:36.881
do you remember what you were thinking
at that moment when...

43:38.081 --> 43:40.321
you lost consciousness ?

43:41.041 --> 43:43.041
I was thinking that...

43:44.121 --> 43:45.841
I didn't want to think about anything.

43:46.041 --> 43:50.121
Maybe this last phrase sums up
all the frustration

43:50.321 --> 43:52.201
felt by a category that feels invisible.

43:52.401 --> 43:55.521
Hold on...
I'm not a category, okay ?

43:55.681 --> 43:58.041
I'm just speaking for myself.
Hey, I'm up here.

43:58.201 --> 44:00.281
I only speak for myself.

44:00.481 --> 44:02.601
Okay.

44:02.801 --> 44:04.841
We're done, I think that'll do.

44:08.481 --> 44:09.521
Hi.

44:10.321 --> 44:11.681
Hi, mum.

44:13.201 --> 44:15.321
Come on, dinner's ready.

44:16.441 --> 44:18.361
You mean that you cooked ?

44:18.521 --> 44:21.161
Indian take-away. Martina brought it.

44:22.081 --> 44:23.441
Martina ?

44:39.041 --> 44:40.721
Come on, let's go !

44:45.161 --> 44:48.081
<i>Now, to end the report
on Tuesday's protest,</i>

44:48.241 --> 44:50.721
<i>let's hear from someone
who was wounded in the clashes.</i>

44:51.321 --> 44:56.401
<i>The images are very gory,
they show that you lost a lot of blood.</i>

44:57.281 --> 45:00.601
<i>Do you remember what you were thinking</i>

45:00.801 --> 45:02.921
<i>at that moment when
you lost consciousness ?</i>

45:04.481 --> 45:06.001
<i>I was thinking that...</i>

45:07.761 --> 45:09.161
<i>I didn't want to think about anything.</i>

45:09.321 --> 45:11.801
<i>Now for our report on nutrition.</i>

45:13.401 --> 45:15.761
You'll win an Oscar!

45:17.201 --> 45:19.321
You're a film star!

45:33.481 --> 45:35.161
You showed them, Riko !

45:35.361 --> 45:37.081
More like they showed me.

45:37.241 --> 45:40.561
You wanted to bust that truncheon
with your head.

46:07.281 --> 46:08.881
Riko !

46:09.041 --> 46:10.881
- Do you like Indian food ?
- Yes.

46:11.401 --> 46:14.321
Do you want to try real Indian food ?
Come to lunch on Sunday.

46:14.481 --> 46:16.561
- Bring your wife.
- Great, thanks.

46:16.961 --> 46:19.841
- See you Sunday. You know where I live.
- Bye.

46:24.321 --> 46:27.681
I know, they've split up three
or four times but always make up.

46:27.841 --> 46:30.401
Patrizio in a steady relationship ?
No way !

46:31.121 --> 46:32.841
Let's see, maybe.

46:37.841 --> 46:39.361
Anyway, you look happy.

46:40.001 --> 46:41.081
I am happy.

46:42.441 --> 46:43.761
But?

46:47.001 --> 46:48.801
But you still haven't told him.

46:51.281 --> 46:53.161
Don't tell him, not ever.

46:53.641 --> 46:54.961
Don't tell him.

46:56.761 --> 46:58.801
And stop having all those doubts.

47:00.561 --> 47:03.721
I love our Monday lunches.
Let's do it more often !

47:19.281 --> 47:20.481
Hi.

47:22.881 --> 47:24.921
I was worried.

47:26.321 --> 47:28.121
There's no need.

47:29.801 --> 47:32.401
So, want to tell me about it?

47:32.961 --> 47:35.001
I'm sure you've heard it all.

47:42.961 --> 47:44.921
No, don't.

47:47.761 --> 47:48.841
No!

47:49.121 --> 47:50.281
I mean it, no.

47:51.361 --> 47:52.561
No?

47:55.841 --> 47:57.041
This is no good.

47:57.361 --> 47:58.881
"This is no good ?".

47:59.041 --> 48:00.761
What do you mean ?

48:01.761 --> 48:04.241
You're the first guy
to ever refuse a blow job.

48:05.041 --> 48:07.561
Edda... let's call it off, okay.

48:07.761 --> 48:10.001
Who are you screwing ?

48:10.201 --> 48:12.321
Sogliani ? Tedeschi ?

48:16.721 --> 48:19.761
One of these days
I'll go get my hair cut by your wife !

48:19.921 --> 48:22.841
I'm dying to have a long chat with her!

48:37.561 --> 48:39.441
I'm outside, come out.

48:39.841 --> 48:42.241
No, I'm not coming in.
You come out.

49:04.241 --> 49:05.441
Well?

49:06.601 --> 49:09.401
- Haven't we said "enough" enough ?
- I'll decide when it's enough.

49:09.761 --> 49:11.121
You'll decide ?

49:11.801 --> 49:14.841
- They broke your wrists last year.
- Are you my uncle ?

49:15.881 --> 49:18.481
- I'm watching, not playing.
- Sure !

49:19.041 --> 49:21.881
What about the casino in Venice ?
Every other day.

49:22.361 --> 49:25.241
And the fruit machines in the county ?
Every other day...

49:26.481 --> 49:29.321
Do you expect us to just sit back
and watch you ?

49:29.841 --> 49:33.521
No, mind your own goddamn business.
And you...

49:34.041 --> 49:36.801
You know how it works with junkies.

49:36.961 --> 49:38.961
You have to hit rock bottom.

49:44.161 --> 49:45.801
I'll be all right.

49:46.561 --> 49:47.681
See you on Friday.

49:54.561 --> 49:55.841
Hi, guys.

49:56.601 --> 49:58.081
- How are you ?
- Good.

50:05.761 --> 50:07.041
Come on in.

50:22.761 --> 50:24.521
My father.

51:13.881 --> 51:16.121
I ate like there's no tomorrow !

51:16.281 --> 51:18.041
Sorry, what ?

51:18.201 --> 51:21.081
I've never eaten so much
in all my life.

51:21.241 --> 51:23.721
- You didn't eat a lot.
- Yes, I did !

51:26.281 --> 51:28.361
- How long have you lived here ?
- I was born here.

51:32.201 --> 51:36.321
Why did your parents choose a place
with the world's worst climate ?

51:37.121 --> 51:40.601
My father's brother lived here
and he persuaded him.

51:41.961 --> 51:44.721
I like it here, I always have.

51:46.201 --> 51:48.521
You're a beautiful family.

51:49.241 --> 51:52.281
You remind me of the stories
my father used to tell me.

51:53.601 --> 51:55.961
He lived with five siblings...

51:56.161 --> 51:59.001
- His parents, and grandparents...
- Don't you like your family ?

51:59.481 --> 52:01.361
Don't you have kids ?

52:01.521 --> 52:04.481
We have a son,
who's almost as old as you.

52:05.521 --> 52:07.761
We wanted to have many more.

52:09.201 --> 52:11.721
But I wasn't able to have any more...

52:13.601 --> 52:15.441
after Luca.

52:16.641 --> 52:19.641
I lost him when I was six months pregnant.

52:20.601 --> 52:23.041
A few more days and he'd have made it.

52:25.761 --> 52:29.081
In these cases the doctors suggest
you see the baby,

52:29.241 --> 52:31.361
otherwise goodness knows
what you'll imagine...

52:32.241 --> 52:35.161
So we held him for a few minutes.

52:41.041 --> 52:42.961
He was perfect.

52:45.801 --> 52:47.041
He had...

52:47.201 --> 52:48.881
Riko's hands !

52:52.361 --> 52:53.601
He was perfect.

52:59.281 --> 53:02.561
I've always wondered
if he managed to take...

53:02.721 --> 53:04.881
at least one breath of our air.

53:06.601 --> 53:07.961
I'm sorry.

53:08.161 --> 53:10.601
It was a long time ago.

53:13.961 --> 53:16.161
Have you been married long ?

53:17.521 --> 53:18.681
Very long.

53:21.761 --> 53:23.521
Maybe too long.

53:26.601 --> 53:29.121
Pavak always says that he's a good man.

53:29.881 --> 53:32.161
- Really ?
- He always says:

53:32.761 --> 53:33.801
"Honest".

53:36.201 --> 53:37.641
Honest...

53:41.001 --> 53:43.401
That's not a family.

53:43.561 --> 53:45.801
- It's an asylum.
- What commotion.

53:48.801 --> 53:51.001
Wonderful commotion.

53:57.841 --> 53:59.281
I need to tell you something.

55:06.521 --> 55:08.601
However much you think I'm a shit,

55:08.761 --> 55:10.761
just know that I feel even worse.

55:11.721 --> 55:15.441
But I've not come to say sorry,
I know that's not enough.

55:15.601 --> 55:18.281
I came to tell you that it was my fault.

55:18.761 --> 55:20.881
And partly her fault too...

55:22.201 --> 55:23.721
But also yours !

55:23.881 --> 55:26.761
Because you don't realise
who you're living with.

55:26.921 --> 55:29.961
And how lucky you are !
It wasn't done to spite you !

55:31.401 --> 55:32.961
It wasn't.

56:03.001 --> 56:05.561
I don't have time to eat now,
sit down.

56:07.081 --> 56:08.521
Please.

56:11.321 --> 56:13.281
Please, sit down.

56:24.921 --> 56:28.641
I know what happens now,
you simply don't say a word.

56:29.401 --> 56:32.561
And I don't know what you're thinking,
but I imagine the worst.

56:34.081 --> 56:36.481
But you're fine with that,
so you don't have to ask.

56:36.641 --> 56:38.801
Because you never ask, not ever.

56:40.401 --> 56:43.481
You never ask how my day's been,

56:43.641 --> 56:47.001
whether I want to do something different,
or what I'm thinking,

56:47.201 --> 56:49.241
or what I'm feeling...

56:52.361 --> 56:54.601
So I end up doing a monologue.

56:55.321 --> 56:57.081
This time too.

57:04.761 --> 57:06.921
It happened only once.

57:08.441 --> 57:10.441
Just once.

57:12.081 --> 57:14.441
It shouldn't have happened, I know.

57:16.521 --> 57:20.081
But it happened only... once.

57:24.001 --> 57:25.961
Is that enough for you ?

57:27.761 --> 57:29.921
That's enough, yes.

57:32.441 --> 57:35.681
Because I've never felt so guilty
in all my life.

57:38.441 --> 57:40.601
And I've never been so disgusted
with myself.

57:43.121 --> 57:46.001
Because you need to know,
that in this case too,

57:47.281 --> 57:50.321
like in every other moment
during all these years together,

57:50.481 --> 57:52.361
I've never...

57:52.521 --> 57:54.281
and I mean never,

57:55.721 --> 57:58.881
I've never budged an inch,
not even for one second.

57:59.041 --> 58:00.801
I have always been here.

58:03.041 --> 58:06.001
Even when I knew for a fact
that you were screwing around.

58:19.001 --> 58:21.241
I think about Luca every day.

58:22.281 --> 58:24.281
Still now.

58:26.841 --> 58:29.241
Sometimes I have the feeling...

58:31.241 --> 58:33.401
the physical feeling, that he's here.

58:35.921 --> 58:38.161
And still now, every day,

58:38.921 --> 58:41.881
I think about how you were there for me
when we lost him.

58:44.241 --> 58:46.201
But it's always been that way.

58:46.361 --> 58:49.721
You and I have always stuck together
through everything,

58:49.881 --> 58:51.841
everything.

58:52.121 --> 58:53.601
And we're still here.

58:57.801 --> 59:00.521
I know why I'm still here.

59:03.241 --> 59:06.001
No one's ever held a gun to your head.

59:10.601 --> 59:12.841
Can we eat now ?

59:51.081 --> 59:52.121
Goon!

59:52.841 --> 59:54.041
Go on, Riko !

59:54.641 --> 59:55.641
Harder !

59:56.921 --> 59:58.081
Harder !

01:00:00.801 --> 01:00:02.041
Thanks.

01:00:02.961 --> 01:00:04.081
Thanks.

01:00:10.521 --> 01:00:14.561
Here's 2,000.
It's the last bit I can give you.

01:00:15.281 --> 01:00:17.681
You can't say I dealt you
the final blow.

01:02:11.841 --> 01:02:13.761
This used to be the foundry.

01:02:14.961 --> 01:02:16.241
Assemblage.

01:02:17.281 --> 01:02:18.441
Lacquering.

01:02:18.841 --> 01:02:20.921
The shipment section
was down there.

01:02:21.081 --> 01:02:23.121
Half of Reggio worked here.

01:02:23.281 --> 01:02:25.041
A city within a city.

01:02:25.201 --> 01:02:28.001
An awesome venue for an illegal rave.

01:02:28.161 --> 01:02:30.201
Don't you dare !

01:02:31.761 --> 01:02:34.601
It needs fixing up,
I need your help.

01:02:46.921 --> 01:02:48.281
I'm ready.

01:02:54.401 --> 01:02:56.321
How ridiculous do we look ?

01:02:57.001 --> 01:02:58.881
I look gorgeous.

01:03:14.001 --> 01:03:15.361
Wonderful !

01:03:19.641 --> 01:03:21.321
You look wonderful !

01:03:22.361 --> 01:03:23.521
Okay...

01:03:24.481 --> 01:03:25.441
Okay.

01:03:26.361 --> 01:03:30.001
We are gathered here
to celebrate the "real" marriage...

01:03:30.761 --> 01:03:34.601
of these two souls, not "soles",
who are soulmates...

01:03:34.801 --> 01:03:38.481
- And housemates and flatmates !
- Who with today's ceremony...

01:03:40.361 --> 01:03:43.521
- intend to defy the perils of time.
- Keep it simple !

01:03:46.401 --> 01:03:49.721
- Riccardo Tirelli and Sara Vercesi ?
- I think so.

01:03:49.921 --> 01:03:53.281
"I think so..."
Say yes ! Can you do that ?

01:03:53.481 --> 01:03:54.801
Yes.

01:03:57.961 --> 01:04:00.561
After this trial period you've had
of 90 odd years,

01:04:00.761 --> 01:04:03.601
it's now time to decide if
you want to live together

01:04:03.801 --> 01:04:05.881
until death do you part.

01:04:07.241 --> 01:04:10.801
Okay, he's crossing his fingers,
to hell with this !

01:04:11.001 --> 01:04:13.081
You call this a proper wedding ceremony ?

01:04:13.361 --> 01:04:15.481
Do you want to take my place ?

01:04:16.281 --> 01:04:19.001
Do you, Riccardo,
really want to spend

01:04:19.201 --> 01:04:22.281
the rest of your life
with Sara here ?

01:04:23.601 --> 01:04:26.921
- If you really insist...
- Go fuck yourselves !

01:04:27.121 --> 01:04:29.161
No, come on, I was joking !

01:04:29.921 --> 01:04:31.401
I do.

01:04:32.401 --> 01:04:36.201
Do you, Sara, despite what you've seen
and endured so far,

01:04:36.361 --> 01:04:39.201
want to tempt fate and go against logic

01:04:39.401 --> 01:04:42.281
and continue to share misfortune,
let's be honest,

01:04:42.481 --> 01:04:44.761
with Riccardo here ?

01:04:45.201 --> 01:04:46.481
I do!

01:04:47.841 --> 01:04:49.321
The rings.

01:05:01.361 --> 01:05:04.041
By the power vested in me,
I declare you...

01:05:06.481 --> 01:05:08.361
off your rockers

01:05:08.561 --> 01:05:10.081
but united till the end.

01:05:10.241 --> 01:05:13.121
May the force be with you
and with my spirit.

01:05:13.521 --> 01:05:14.481
Kiss the bride !

01:07:30.481 --> 01:07:33.721
What's so funny ?
We honeymooned in Italy, yes.

01:07:33.881 --> 01:07:35.601
What's wrong with that ?

01:07:36.561 --> 01:07:38.481
What did we see...

01:07:38.881 --> 01:07:40.401
So much stuff.

01:07:41.601 --> 01:07:43.001
So much stuff.

01:07:43.361 --> 01:07:45.441
What did you do in August?

01:07:48.201 --> 01:07:49.401
Nice !

01:07:51.201 --> 01:07:54.641
I'll get back to you
about Saturday, okay ?

01:07:56.161 --> 01:07:57.321
Sorry I

01:07:59.081 --> 01:08:01.601
Did you get my text saying I'd be late ?

01:08:03.361 --> 01:08:05.361
Hold on, wait...

01:08:07.641 --> 01:08:10.401
Did you do this or
is someone hiding in the house ?

01:08:11.641 --> 01:08:14.041
I can make it all disappear
in a flash.

01:08:16.841 --> 01:08:18.881
You have to eat it all up.

01:08:19.041 --> 01:08:22.161
And you have to say "delicious"
every three minutes.

01:08:24.401 --> 01:08:27.121
I've put two bottles of water
by the bed.

01:08:27.281 --> 01:08:31.041
Is that your subtle way of telling me
that I overdid it with the salt ?

01:08:38.161 --> 01:08:40.121
I have to go see my folks tomorrow.

01:08:40.321 --> 01:08:42.281
I haven't been in ages.

01:08:42.441 --> 01:08:45.201
Whatever your post-dinner plans were...

01:08:45.361 --> 01:08:48.361
the image of your folks
is putting me off mine.

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:50.640
Sorry. I'll fix that.

01:09:10.121 --> 01:09:12.041
You can't stay off your phone !

01:09:12.201 --> 01:09:15.281
I'll be at the factory in 10 minutes.
What is it?

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:41.121
The stench.

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:45.801
They realised because of the stench.

01:09:52.001 --> 01:09:54.961
They took him away as soon as possible...

01:09:56.001 --> 01:09:58.041
because of the stench.

01:10:06.881 --> 01:10:08.721
Five days !

01:10:10.561 --> 01:10:13.241
Shit, Riko, he'd been dead five days !

01:10:16.041 --> 01:10:18.001
And no one had called him.

01:10:19.281 --> 01:10:21.201
Not even us.

01:10:26.521 --> 01:10:28.361
Not even us.

01:11:02.401 --> 01:11:05.201
- What is it, Pietro ?
- I heard that you're <i>back.</i>

01:11:05.361 --> 01:11:08.801
- <i>Yes.</i>
- <i>I sent you an email, have</i> a <i>read.</i>

01:11:09.121 --> 01:11:11.641
- Not now, come on.
- It's about him.

01:11:12.281 --> 01:11:13.721
<i>Bye.</i>

01:11:24.921 --> 01:11:27.641
I don't know if I should send this,
but here goes.

01:11:30.881 --> 01:11:33.281
How did I get here ?

01:11:35.681 --> 01:11:38.481
Have any of you ever thought of
killing yourselves ?

01:11:40.601 --> 01:11:42.041
I have.

01:11:42.201 --> 01:11:43.681
Not all the time.

01:11:43.881 --> 01:11:45.561
Just every so often.

01:11:45.721 --> 01:11:48.321
The fact is, when you have
a rotten heart like mine,

01:11:48.481 --> 01:11:51.521
in the physical sense, because spiritually
speaking it's splendid...

01:11:52.321 --> 01:11:55.001
I mean, when you have a rotten heart,

01:11:55.161 --> 01:11:59.801
every day is like
a game of Russian Roulette.

01:12:00.161 --> 01:12:04.361
So if it has to happen, why can't I
be the one to decide when to go ?

01:12:05.161 --> 01:12:09.481
But, I wouldn't slit my wrists,
I wouldn't shoot myself,

01:12:10.241 --> 01:12:12.961
I definitely wouldn't swallow poison,

01:12:13.121 --> 01:12:14.801
so I thought of the Po River...

01:12:14.961 --> 01:12:16.681
It's no Golden Gate Bridge,

01:12:16.881 --> 01:12:18.881
but the currents would drag you down.

01:12:19.041 --> 01:12:21.841
Otherwise, the putrid water
will finish you off.

01:12:22.001 --> 01:12:24.721
And if you survive
the currents and putrid water,

01:12:24.881 --> 01:12:28.561
that means your time's not up,
that you have to wait, end of story.

01:12:29.881 --> 01:12:31.321
The Po River !

01:12:31.801 --> 01:12:36.001
It's a good compromise, don't you think ?
You try then nature decides.

01:12:36.161 --> 01:12:37.441
Anyway...

01:12:38.681 --> 01:12:40.641
How did I get here ?

01:12:41.121 --> 01:12:42.801
In <i>spurts.</i>

01:12:43.361 --> 01:12:44.921
And what am I doing here ?

01:12:47.121 --> 01:12:49.041
Everything I can.

01:13:18.001 --> 01:13:20.201
<i>Poor guy! He died young.</i>

01:13:20.361 --> 01:13:22.681
<i>But with his heart,
his days were numbered.</i>

01:13:23.601 --> 01:13:25.761
There was a nice article in the paper.

01:13:25.961 --> 01:13:27.441
He was a real artist.

01:13:27.601 --> 01:13:31.001
"Everyone loved him,
he was a real artist..." Listen to you !

01:13:31.841 --> 01:13:34.521
With all due respect for the tragedy,
let's be honest...

01:13:34.681 --> 01:13:38.201
He may have been an artist
but he'd never done fuck all.

01:13:38.361 --> 01:13:40.961
Apart from squandering
his family's wealth.

01:13:41.121 --> 01:13:43.201
It's always the same old story.

01:13:43.361 --> 01:13:45.801
The typical cliché of the artist.

01:13:45.961 --> 01:13:49.161
It's either heroin, or coke, or gambling.

01:13:49.321 --> 01:13:52.601
And now, perhaps, his works
will soar in value. Come on !

01:13:53.521 --> 01:13:57.161
- Apologize.
- Apologize ? Who to ?

01:13:58.081 --> 01:14:01.481
And what for ?
For saying what I think ?

01:14:01.641 --> 01:14:05.521
- Apologize.
- Listen, he was your friend...

01:14:06.361 --> 01:14:07.761
Sucks for you.

01:15:33.201 --> 01:15:35.361
Come in, Riko. Sit down.

01:15:52.721 --> 01:15:54.761
"The regulations are to blame.

01:15:56.201 --> 01:15:58.681
Italian pork must be
of a certain quality,

01:15:58.841 --> 01:16:01.241
unlike imported pork,
which is cheaper.

01:16:02.041 --> 01:16:04.561
The market, the recession is to blame...

01:16:05.361 --> 01:16:07.681
You can't imagine, Riko,

01:16:07.841 --> 01:16:10.161
how awful we feel having to do this.

01:16:10.521 --> 01:16:13.241
If there were another option,
we'd choose it. But there isn't."

01:16:13.401 --> 01:16:15.321
- Listen...
- No, it's fine.

01:16:23.441 --> 01:16:27.081
When I started here, 30 years ago,
the Veroni family still ran it.

01:16:28.481 --> 01:16:32.281
Mr Arnaldo Veroni
always maintained a presence here.

01:16:33.161 --> 01:16:35.641
I don't even know who you are.

01:16:35.801 --> 01:16:39.001
The market, the regulations,
the recession...

01:16:39.161 --> 01:16:41.961
You think I don't understand ?
I do !

01:16:43.281 --> 01:16:45.761
But all I can say is fuck you !

01:16:48.121 --> 01:16:49.321
Well...

01:16:50.041 --> 01:16:53.241
First of all, thanks for sparing me
from having to do my speech...

01:16:54.161 --> 01:16:57.041
I'm so sick of repeating it.

01:16:58.321 --> 01:17:02.761
We've prepared a bonus for you
along with your redundancy pay.

01:17:03.921 --> 01:17:07.041
We managed to make Crotti
drop the charges.

01:17:07.841 --> 01:17:11.241
You broke his nose and jaw,
it wasn't simple.

01:17:12.761 --> 01:17:15.561
We'll give you a clean reference.

01:17:16.801 --> 01:17:19.681
I'll allow for your "fuck you"

01:17:19.841 --> 01:17:21.401
and good luck.

01:18:21.121 --> 01:18:23.121
Even at breakfast ?

01:18:29.441 --> 01:18:31.521
It's a beautiful day.

01:18:32.081 --> 01:18:34.121
Let's do something, come on !

01:18:35.761 --> 01:18:37.081
Riccione ?

01:18:37.921 --> 01:18:39.761
Cinque Terre.

01:18:42.921 --> 01:18:44.961
See if Angela's free.

01:18:47.681 --> 01:18:49.481
Go with her.

01:18:52.521 --> 01:18:55.441
I think you should stop looking for work
for a while.

01:18:56.881 --> 01:18:59.081
You've become obsessed.

01:19:01.601 --> 01:19:03.961
We'll manage, the salon's doing well.

01:19:06.961 --> 01:19:08.321
Cesenatico ?

01:19:10.801 --> 01:19:12.401
Saint Tropez ?

01:19:12.561 --> 01:19:13.841
Monte Carlo !

01:19:14.601 --> 01:19:15.721
All dressed up.

01:19:16.201 --> 01:19:19.081
I'll wear that amazing dress,
with the low-cut neckline.

01:19:19.281 --> 01:19:20.801
You'll wear big sunglasses.

01:19:35.321 --> 01:19:36.601
Found a job ?

01:19:37.241 --> 01:19:39.081
No luck ?

01:19:41.801 --> 01:19:44.361
Don't worry, you'll find something.

01:19:45.841 --> 01:19:47.801
Have you just woken up ?

01:19:48.961 --> 01:19:50.841
It all gets messed up.

01:19:51.881 --> 01:19:53.121
Day, night...

01:19:56.761 --> 01:19:58.681
Can't you get it up 7

01:19:59.961 --> 01:20:01.521
That happens.

01:20:10.401 --> 01:20:13.001
How do you get through the day ?

01:20:21.521 --> 01:20:23.321
I can't take it anymore.

01:20:25.561 --> 01:20:27.721
He just sits there, saying nothing...

01:20:30.761 --> 01:20:33.841
Matteo keeps calling him,
so do Max and Patrizio...

01:20:34.001 --> 01:20:35.241
I know.

01:20:36.041 --> 01:20:38.041
He won't even turn his phone on.

01:20:40.521 --> 01:20:44.721
He just sits in front of the TV
with the volume off.

01:20:46.401 --> 01:20:49.401
I have to take him to the therapist
or he won't go.

01:20:49.561 --> 01:20:52.241
I have to feed him his medication.

01:20:52.441 --> 01:20:55.441
- He'll pull through, I'm sure.
- I'm not, it's been six months.

01:21:06.041 --> 01:21:07.961
He doesn't even wash anymore.

01:21:10.161 --> 01:21:13.441
Every so often I force myself
to make love but even there...

01:21:14.481 --> 01:21:16.241
I do all the work.

01:21:16.641 --> 01:21:19.281
- Is he still looking for work ?
- Not really.

01:21:20.481 --> 01:21:22.521
I understand, it's constant rejections.

01:21:23.521 --> 01:21:25.281
But...

01:21:26.401 --> 01:21:28.721
We can still get by,
it's not that.

01:21:28.921 --> 01:21:31.281
You know that's not how it works.

01:21:32.481 --> 01:21:34.561
It's not just about the wage packet.

01:21:36.961 --> 01:21:40.361
Let's go out dancing.
It wasn't a question.

01:21:40.761 --> 01:21:41.921
Come on.

01:21:42.121 --> 01:21:43.241
What a beauty !

01:22:26.841 --> 01:22:28.881
Answer, dammit ! Answer.

01:22:37.521 --> 01:22:39.601
Come on, dad.

01:22:44.001 --> 01:22:45.401
Eat.

01:22:47.001 --> 01:22:48.961
No, you have to eat !

01:22:49.321 --> 01:22:52.041
Don't say you don't like
what I've made.

01:22:52.201 --> 01:22:53.921
I'm sick to death of this !

01:22:54.081 --> 01:22:57.841
I work all day like a slave
and you don't lift a finger!

01:22:58.001 --> 01:23:00.241
Snap out of it ! Do something !

01:23:03.401 --> 01:23:05.401
Eat your soup !

01:23:05.801 --> 01:23:08.761
I spent half an hour making it,
you have to eat it.

01:23:13.121 --> 01:23:15.121
Eat, you're too thin.

01:23:21.081 --> 01:23:22.321
Eat.

01:23:24.081 --> 01:23:24.961
Eat.

01:23:27.601 --> 01:23:29.481
Eat. Come on !

01:23:31.761 --> 01:23:33.321
Fuck you <i>g</i>

01:23:33.481 --> 01:23:34.921
Fuck you <i>g</i>

01:23:47.121 --> 01:23:48.361
Come here.

01:23:53.041 --> 01:23:54.721
Come here.

01:26:46.801 --> 01:26:48.281
Hey, nutcase !

01:26:49.321 --> 01:26:51.241
I mean, just saying...

01:26:51.761 --> 01:26:54.161
Yes, you nutcase !

01:26:57.241 --> 01:26:59.161
Shall we go for a drink ?

01:27:00.241 --> 01:27:03.361
You'd rather stay here in the car ?
It's up to you.

01:27:05.681 --> 01:27:07.561
The last time I saw you,
you spoke.

01:27:10.361 --> 01:27:12.321
Whereas you've never stopped.

01:27:13.521 --> 01:27:15.761
Wait, you threw yourself
into the Po River...

01:27:15.961 --> 01:27:19.881
Are you radioactive ?
If you are, you should tell me.

01:27:23.481 --> 01:27:27.081
If you become like Hulk,
we'll open a circus just for you.

01:27:27.241 --> 01:27:29.481
- Okay ?
- Fuck you !

01:27:29.961 --> 01:27:32.681
He threw himself into the Po River !

01:27:32.841 --> 01:27:34.281
Cut it out!

01:27:40.601 --> 01:27:41.801
Hi.

01:27:41.961 --> 01:27:44.881
Lidia told me that you met up with Max.

01:27:45.361 --> 01:27:46.761
I'm glad.

01:27:47.361 --> 01:27:50.281
I didn't fancy cooking,
I got us some pizzas.

01:27:50.441 --> 01:27:52.641
- Is there a film on ?
- Yes.

01:27:53.681 --> 01:27:55.801
This is good one !

01:27:56.721 --> 01:27:59.761
But we have to turn it up,
even just for the music.

01:28:09.201 --> 01:28:10.801
I'll get something to drink.

01:28:30.001 --> 01:28:32.481
Beer, Coke, water ? You choose.

01:28:34.921 --> 01:28:36.041
Yes ?

01:28:40.041 --> 01:28:41.321
Yes ?

01:28:44.961 --> 01:28:46.441
Yes I

01:28:57.481 --> 01:28:58.761
Yes I

01:29:21.321 --> 01:29:24.001
<i>Hi, Carnival. Where are you ?</i>

01:29:27.041 --> 01:29:31.121
<i>Wherever you are,
maybe these words will reach you.</i>

01:29:32.321 --> 01:29:35.401
<i>Ever think I'd be a dogsbody
in a restaurant in Frankfurt ?</i>

01:29:35.561 --> 01:29:36.721
<i>It's not a bad city.</i>

01:29:37.401 --> 01:29:41.361
<i>A bit harsh... even its name:
Frankfurt.</i>

01:29:42.121 --> 01:29:44.521
<i>I've been here for four months now
and, well...</i>

01:29:45.321 --> 01:29:47.961
<i>It's tough.
But I'm tough</i> too.

01:29:48.881 --> 01:29:51.761
<i>You have to take the work you get,
if you can.</i>

01:29:52.681 --> 01:29:55.561
<i>Pavak found me the job,
he's got relatives here.</i>

01:29:56.241 --> 01:30:00.041
<i>It's an Italian restaurant, with lots of
Italian customers, Italian food...</i>

01:30:00.281 --> 01:30:03.521
<i>I do quite well, at the end of the day.
It's well-paid.</i>

01:30:05.721 --> 01:30:07.841
<i>I'm going to be a dad again
next month.</i>

01:30:08.841 --> 01:30:11.281
<i>Do you find that funny ? So do I.</i>

01:30:11.601 --> 01:30:13.241
<i>Sara's terrified.</i>

01:30:14.001 --> 01:30:16.841
<i>Every day I tell her that
the baby will be healthy and strong.</i>

01:30:17.641 --> 01:30:19.041
<i>It's a girl.</i>

01:30:19.321 --> 01:30:22.001
<i>I don't just say it to reassure her</i>

01:30:22.161 --> 01:30:25.241
<i>but because I know
that's how it will be.</i>

01:30:28.881 --> 01:30:30.641
<i>You know that Sara beat me up once ?</i>

01:30:31.121 --> 01:30:32.801
<i>Proper blows, by the way.</i>

01:30:32.961 --> 01:30:34.801
<i>Because I'd decided to come here.</i>

01:30:35.361 --> 01:30:38.481
<i>And even now, every goddamn day,
she treats me like a kid.</i>

01:30:38.641 --> 01:30:40.761
<i>Enough ! Leave that place ! Come home !</i>

01:30:41.561 --> 01:30:43.441
<i>But the point is precisely that home.</i>

01:30:44.081 --> 01:30:46.441
<i>I'm not going to sell that house.</i>

01:30:46.601 --> 01:30:49.681
<i>Maybe one day one of my children
will sell it.</i>

01:30:49.841 --> 01:30:53.441
<i>But I'm not selling it.
Because I want to go back.</i>

01:30:54.161 --> 01:30:55.481
<i>Because I will go back.</i>

01:30:56.161 --> 01:30:57.481
<i>I'll go back.</i>

01:30:58.881 --> 01:31:00.161
<i>I read somewhere</i>

01:31:00.321 --> 01:31:04.561
<i>that it takes seven years for our cells
to die and make way for new ones.</i>

01:31:05.561 --> 01:31:09.121
<i>As I've got plenty of time to think,
I was wondering:</i>

01:31:09.681 --> 01:31:14.441
<i>"How come we're still us ?</i>

01:31:16.561 --> 01:31:20.361
<i>What's that particle made of
that survives once our cells die ?"</i>

01:31:23.241 --> 01:31:25.081
<i>I'm made of my family,</i>

01:31:26.481 --> 01:31:29.801
<i>I'm made of you,
of Max, of all the others.</i>

01:31:30.521 --> 01:31:33.801
<i>We're made of our small city,
of its walls,</i>

01:31:34.321 --> 01:31:37.521
<i>of the stories we've been told about it
and of others like us.</i>

01:31:38.241 --> 01:31:40.001
<i>We're made of that air.</i>

01:31:41.081 --> 01:31:43.241
<i>I know you'll laugh
when I tell you that I've realized</i>

01:31:43.401 --> 01:31:45.481
<i>what being homesick means.</i>

01:31:46.281 --> 01:31:47.601
<i>But it's true.</i>

01:31:47.761 --> 01:31:51.041
<i>It's so strong I sometimes think
that you can't confine air.</i>

01:31:52.201 --> 01:31:55.561
<i>Then it seems like I can see,
from here, from far away,</i>

01:31:55.921 --> 01:31:57.681
<i>that perhaps in some way,</i>

01:31:58.041 --> 01:32:02.041
<i>somehow,
we're also made of Trieste,</i>

01:32:02.201 --> 01:32:03.801
<i>Milan, Cagliari,</i>

01:32:04.441 --> 01:32:05.961
<i>Lecce, Venice,</i>

01:32:06.601 --> 01:32:08.161
<i>Pescara, Palermo.</i>

01:32:09.361 --> 01:32:12.121
<i>Perhaps we're made of beauty
and putridness.</i>

01:32:12.441 --> 01:32:14.641
<i>Of lies, of fear.</i>

01:32:14.961 --> 01:32:16.761
<i>Of chaos and wonders.</i>

01:32:18.041 --> 01:32:20.321
<i>And we're also made of last ditch efforts.</i>

01:32:20.481 --> 01:32:22.481
<i>A series of last ditch efforts.</i>

01:32:23.761 --> 01:32:26.121
<i>We're made of contempt...</i>

01:32:27.281 --> 01:32:28.441
<i>and yes...</i>

01:32:28.841 --> 01:32:30.001
of love.

01:32:31.841 --> 01:32:33.801
<i>Do you think I've become sentimental ?</i>

01:32:35.681 --> 01:32:36.961
<i>Yes...</i>

01:32:38.121 --> 01:32:40.401
<i>I'm waiting to see how things work out.</i>

01:32:41.001 --> 01:32:44.841
<i>But at least I know they will work out,
I'm sure of that.</i>

01:32:46.281 --> 01:32:49.201
<i>Wherever you are,
take care of yourself.</i>

01:32:50.161 --> 01:32:53.361
<i>And wherever you are,
I'm sending you a big hug.</i>

01:32:54.401 --> 01:32:58.761
<i>P.S. The other day Pietro sent me
an email with a quote by Cesare Pavese.</i>

01:32:58.921 --> 01:33:00.161
<i>This is what it said:</i>

01:33:00.441 --> 01:33:03.081
<i>"You need a village,</i>

01:33:03.361 --> 01:33:05.841
<i>if only for the pleasure of leaving it.</i>

01:33:06.561 --> 01:33:08.961
<i>Your own village means that
you are not alone.</i>

01:33:09.201 --> 01:33:13.721
<i>That you know that in the people
and the plants and the soil,</i>

01:33:13.961 --> 01:33:15.801
<i>there is something of you,</i>

01:33:15.961 --> 01:33:18.161
<i>that even when you are not there,</i>

01:33:18.321 --> 01:33:20.201
<i>it waits to welcome you back."</i>

01:33:27.441 --> 01:33:29.841
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE ?

01:33:46.321 --> 01:33:47.921
What am I doing here ?

01:33:50.801 --> 01:33:52.481
What am I doing here...

01:33:53.305 --> 01:33:59.460
