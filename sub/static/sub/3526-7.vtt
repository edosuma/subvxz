01:58.118 --> 01:59.585
You guys speak English?

01:59.619 --> 02:01.985
Not some too much.

02:55.542 --> 02:57.203
l just wanna say

02:57.243 --> 02:59.643
it's been a while
since we opened the books

02:59.679 --> 03:02.443
and in regards
to you guys--

03:02.482 --> 03:04.040
Burt, Gerry--

03:04.083 --> 03:06.051
as a man
of few words, l--

03:06.085 --> 03:08.280
Not few enough, though, huh?
New blood.

03:08.321 --> 03:10.846
- New blood.
- Salut.

03:15.395 --> 03:17.226
Sure, we break
some balls here tonight,

03:17.263 --> 03:18.958
but l go way back.

03:18.998 --> 03:20.989
And in light
of recent humiliations,

03:21.034 --> 03:24.902
it's a honor
to be joined by men

03:24.938 --> 03:27.873
and not faggot-ass
corn-holing cocksuckers

03:27.907 --> 03:29.568
like married my cousin.

03:29.609 --> 03:31.338
- He should fuckin' die!
- Phil, relax.

03:31.377 --> 03:34.505
- Whoa whoa whoa, Phil.
- Take it easy.

03:34.547 --> 03:36.742
Phil, you know the wine
makes you emotional.

03:36.783 --> 03:38.580
'Cause l got
an empty fuckin' stomach.

03:38.618 --> 03:42.520
- So have a breadstick.
- 45 minutes for some grilled eggplant?

03:42.555 --> 03:45.023
Jesus Christ, is there nothing
without this complaining?

03:45.058 --> 03:49.085
You didn't notice?
Artie's game is a little off lately.

03:49.128 --> 03:51.460
Well, Carmela sent
her branzino back Sunday night,

03:51.497 --> 03:53.431
but she loves
to do that.

03:53.466 --> 03:55.093
Gentlemen,
how's everything so far?

03:55.134 --> 03:56.897
- Fantastic.
- Delicious.

03:56.936 --> 03:58.528
The delay--
a thousand pardons.

03:58.571 --> 04:00.368
l'm breaking in
a new guy on the line.

04:00.406 --> 04:01.873
You seem set
for antipasto.

04:01.908 --> 04:04.934
l gotta be honest-- new guy
in the kitchen aside,

04:04.978 --> 04:07.242
l mean, how come we're waiting?
lt seems empty out there.

04:07.280 --> 04:09.680
People like to get in
that last barbecue.

04:09.716 --> 04:13.311
Artie, you been
to this ''Da Giovanni'' up by Troy Hills?

04:13.353 --> 04:15.753
- No, l haven't been.
- Supposed to be incredible.

04:15.788 --> 04:17.688
- He's a kid, right?
- l hate fish,

04:17.724 --> 04:19.783
but his,
with the agrodolce...

04:19.826 --> 04:22.158
l'll check it out.

04:22.195 --> 04:24.925
- Ah, buon appetito.
- About time.

04:33.339 --> 04:36.672
Fuckin' Phil.
Some display, huh?

04:36.709 --> 04:39.405
Paid a visit
to Vito's goomar, Jill.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.413
She still hasn't
heard from Vito.

04:43.383 --> 04:46.910
We were just discussin'
''La Cage aux Fat.''

04:46.953 --> 04:49.421
l was gonna get my cousin Tommy
to call his detective friend.

04:49.455 --> 04:52.754
l've been hamstrung with that work
stoppage at the office park.

04:52.792 --> 04:56.284
Vito shows up-- he shows up,
then we deal with him. lf not...

04:56.329 --> 04:58.422
lt's just a phone call.
And seriously,

04:58.464 --> 05:02.059
Tommy says the guy can track somebody
from the corn in his shit.

05:02.101 --> 05:04.126
Yeah, l saw them
do that on ''CSl.''

05:07.140 --> 05:09.108
- Good night.
- Bye, Sack.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.235
- Bye now.
- Good night, kid.

05:11.277 --> 05:13.768
Hey, l was glad to hear you say
that about the search,

05:13.813 --> 05:17.544
'cause l gotta take a little time off
for some business in Cali.

05:17.583 --> 05:20.848
Little Carmine's
lined up a meet in L.A. for us.

05:20.887 --> 05:23.287
So, what is it,
business or time off?

05:23.323 --> 05:25.621
Time off from here,
but definite business.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.489
With Ben Kingsley, Ton'.

05:27.527 --> 05:29.085
So you're gonna go
get an autograph

05:29.128 --> 05:31.619
on the weekend
of the Notre Dame-Michigan game?

05:31.664 --> 05:33.962
l got my guys all over it.
Little Carmine says

05:34.000 --> 05:36.400
if we attach Ben Kingsley,
the picture's a go.

05:36.436 --> 05:38.165
Little Carmine?

05:38.204 --> 05:40.468
lt's common knowledge
the guy's retarded.

05:40.506 --> 05:42.770
l don't get it.
You agreed to this in the hospital.

05:42.809 --> 05:45.039
Christopher,
l was in a coma.

05:46.646 --> 05:49.877
Okay, fine.
l'll call Little Carmine,

05:49.916 --> 05:53.147
call the airline, cancel.

05:54.454 --> 05:57.014
l'll probably
still reach someone.

05:58.124 --> 05:59.921
What am l gonna do
with you?

05:59.959 --> 06:02.325
Make a lot of money.

06:04.097 --> 06:06.258
All right.

06:12.605 --> 06:15.836
What the fuck
is this idiot doing?

06:17.744 --> 06:19.234
No speak English.

06:19.278 --> 06:21.178
...Brooklyn.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.273
Ho, pal.
Move your car. We're late.

06:27.653 --> 06:29.621
Move el automobile.

06:32.625 --> 06:36.755
Rusty! Don't forget
to call Marissa.

06:40.099 --> 06:41.361
Hurry up. Let me see.

06:45.671 --> 06:48.003
- Museum...
- Eastern Parkway.

06:48.040 --> 06:50.565
Eastern Parkway,
not the Belt Parkway.

07:10.396 --> 07:13.092
So l'm trying to eject the DVD
and the kids are freaking,

07:13.132 --> 07:15.123
''What's wrong
with that lady, Daddy?''

07:15.168 --> 07:17.568
- And Carrie says--
- How's the scaloppine?

07:17.603 --> 07:19.798
Uh, it's delicious.
Thanks.

07:19.839 --> 07:22.467
lt all depends on slicing
the veal very thin.

07:22.508 --> 07:24.476
My way--

07:24.510 --> 07:26.740
l like to chill it down
a degree or two

07:26.779 --> 07:29.145
and then l pull a straight razor
right across it.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.046
Your father could cook.

07:32.084 --> 07:34.985
He told me when you were in here last.
75th birthday, right?

07:35.021 --> 07:38.149
- ln the navy.
- What's that?

07:38.191 --> 07:39.658
ln the navy,
he cooked.

07:39.692 --> 07:41.887
Terrific guy.
Great head of hair.

07:41.928 --> 07:43.395
- You enjoy.
- Mmm.

07:43.429 --> 07:46.956
Save room. l'll be back
with dessert specials.

07:48.568 --> 07:50.536
Ho, Benny,
Moe and Jack.

07:50.570 --> 07:52.401
How's the bruschett'?

07:52.438 --> 07:54.201
You got a quorum.
Let me get you a table.

07:54.240 --> 07:57.038
You guys go ahead.
l'm gonna stay right here.

07:57.076 --> 08:00.011
My best customer,
but he's nailed to this fuckin' spot.

08:00.046 --> 08:03.072
lt's either the wine
or the view.

08:03.115 --> 08:04.673
Such a sweet kid.

08:04.717 --> 08:06.844
You know, she told Charmaine
that back in Albania

08:06.886 --> 08:08.410
her whole family
got blown up

08:08.454 --> 08:11.753
waiting on line
for an oil change.

08:11.791 --> 08:13.850
The shit she's been through,
we just had to help.

08:13.893 --> 08:16.054
l even called in a favor with my cousin
in Manhattan,

08:16.095 --> 08:18.689
got her a working visa,
started on the green card.

08:18.731 --> 08:21.063
Martina,
come do some hosting.

08:23.202 --> 08:24.794
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:24.837 --> 08:25.895
What's up?

08:25.938 --> 08:27.769
This is your cheering
section over here.

08:27.807 --> 08:30.605
- Hello, Benny.
- You got the reservations squared away?

08:30.643 --> 08:32.474
lt's very few
right now.

08:32.511 --> 08:35.207
Football season.

08:36.682 --> 08:38.616
l could watch her
walk away all night.

08:38.650 --> 08:41.813
Good, 'cause like most girls with you,
that's what she's gonna do.

08:41.854 --> 08:43.947
Ah, to be young
and single again like these two,

08:43.990 --> 08:45.480
- huh, Benito?
- Ahh.

09:15.121 --> 09:17.783
l can put the credit card numbers on
actual plastic

09:17.823 --> 09:20.348
for an extra five bills.

09:22.461 --> 09:24.224
We do lnternet strictly.

09:39.412 --> 09:42.404
Mmm, the gnocchi!

09:44.150 --> 09:46.948
l'll take your word.
lt's a little too rich for my stomach.

09:46.986 --> 09:49.819
lt's okay.
Just a bite.

09:52.325 --> 09:54.316
l think it's
a lamb ragu

09:54.360 --> 09:56.419
with just a scoop
of cold rigott'.

09:56.462 --> 09:57.861
Holy shit.

09:57.897 --> 10:00.058
lt's all so fresh.
That fish with pistachios?

10:00.099 --> 10:02.624
l feel like a traitor.

10:02.668 --> 10:05.330
Vesuvio, lately,
it's depressing somehow.

10:05.371 --> 10:07.703
Maybe they need to remodel
or something. l don't know.

10:07.740 --> 10:09.799
That menu
is so tired.

10:09.842 --> 10:12.709
- Hey, Homo Junior!
- Leave me the fuck alone!

10:12.745 --> 10:16.841
Get-- stop it!
Mom, they're hurting Vito!

10:16.882 --> 10:19.510
- Stop it!
- Where are your parents?

10:22.521 --> 10:24.921
l guess she can't hide
her face at home.

10:24.957 --> 10:28.051
lt'd be like admitting
there was something wrong.

10:28.094 --> 10:29.857
l should have brought
a pair of sweatpants

10:29.895 --> 10:31.760
to change into.
l'm gonna explode.

10:31.797 --> 10:34.766
Apparently,
there is still a veal loin

10:34.800 --> 10:36.597
yet to be unveiled.

10:39.238 --> 10:41.001
Please, don't get up.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.803
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

10:42.842 --> 10:44.469
That kid,
l'm tellin' you...

10:44.510 --> 10:48.037
- Thank you.
- ...he was so handsome in that church.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.844
The name he took, ''Francis''--
after my pop.

10:50.883 --> 10:54.080
No restaurants in Brooklyn?
You gotta come all the way to Jersey?

10:54.120 --> 10:57.578
This food-- it's worth a detour.
Why? ls there a problem?

10:57.623 --> 11:00.820
Artie's a friend of mine, you know?
l like to throw him some business.

11:00.860 --> 11:03.522
Talk to you a minute?

11:06.399 --> 11:08.196
Visited with John.

11:08.234 --> 11:10.964
He said to tell you
he appreciates the recent headlines.

11:12.705 --> 11:13.899
Rusty.

11:13.939 --> 11:15.770
l don't know what
you're talkin' about.

11:15.808 --> 11:18.276
l turned him down
on that.

11:18.310 --> 11:20.972
Madonn', you're
a cautious man.

11:21.013 --> 11:23.607
You know, some people might feel
a little offended.

11:23.649 --> 11:26.880
Me-- my heart
is an open book.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.320
Anyway, Rusty's gone

11:32.358 --> 11:34.326
and we'll chalk it up
to the headless horseman.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.294
Giovanni.

11:40.499 --> 11:42.797
Bravo!

12:05.424 --> 12:07.392
Martina was just
tellin' me

12:07.426 --> 12:09.417
that in Montenegro
l'd be the tallest guy.

12:09.462 --> 12:11.327
Another fun fact
from the Balkans.

12:11.363 --> 12:13.456
Ben, are you up
for dessert?

12:13.499 --> 12:15.228
No, l'm all set here.
Thanks.

12:15.267 --> 12:17.235
Martina, sweetheart,

12:17.269 --> 12:19.328
can l talk to you
for a second?

12:20.339 --> 12:22.136
What is it, Artie?

12:24.076 --> 12:26.237
You're looking at me
very serious.

12:26.278 --> 12:28.246
You remember l had
that friend in Manhattan

12:28.280 --> 12:31.477
that was gonna help speed you through
the green card process?

12:31.517 --> 12:34.816
Apparently,
it's not happening.

12:34.854 --> 12:37.414
- Why?
- Too much on his plate, he said.

12:37.456 --> 12:39.981
l guess you're just gonna
have to do it yourself. l'm sorry.

12:40.025 --> 12:43.290
All those forms.
Shit me.

12:43.329 --> 12:45.820
l wish l could help you,
but really,

12:45.865 --> 12:48.698
it's a small inconvenience compared
to living in freedom, right?

12:48.734 --> 12:50.565
Yes, l know this.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.408
Get him another 'buca.

13:03.916 --> 13:05.907
Hey, Tony.

13:20.466 --> 13:23.902
You could fuck her,
you know?

13:23.936 --> 13:25.403
Well...

13:25.437 --> 13:26.995
l'm not 100/%
in that department,

13:27.039 --> 13:30.167
but l'm startin'
to feel the old pressure.

13:31.911 --> 13:33.936
lt's funny,
'cause guys like me, we come here,

13:33.979 --> 13:35.970
we get drunk
and stare.

13:36.015 --> 13:38.916
Best-case scenario, we go
in the back room, we get a lap dance

13:38.951 --> 13:42.443
a dry hump and pfft--
blow in our pants.

13:45.257 --> 13:48.385
Listen, you wanna fuck her so bad,
l'm sure it could be worked out.

13:48.427 --> 13:50.486
Nah, l couldn't.

13:50.529 --> 13:52.656
But you...

13:52.698 --> 13:54.757
Well, what do you
want me to say?

13:54.800 --> 13:57.200
Nothing.
lt's just a fact.

13:57.236 --> 13:59.568
lf l knew you were gonna be
in such a pissy mood--

14:04.143 --> 14:07.340
Gabriella Dante and Rosalie Aprile
came in for lunch yesterday.

14:07.379 --> 14:09.210
So what, you wanna fuck
one of them now?

14:09.248 --> 14:11.546
No.

14:11.584 --> 14:14.212
Gab said you all went and had a meal
at Da Giovanni on Sunday.

14:18.490 --> 14:20.219
Well, l was gonna
tell you.

14:20.259 --> 14:24.787
lt was Phil's grandson's confirmation.
lt's a pain in the ass.

14:24.830 --> 14:26.525
What are you gonna do?
You gotta eat.

14:26.565 --> 14:29.056
lt's nothing' special,
believe me.

14:29.101 --> 14:33.401
Actually, Carm got a little sick after.
Too much oil, she thought.

14:33.439 --> 14:35.270
Gab said
l should check it out,

14:35.307 --> 14:36.797
like l could learn
something.

14:36.842 --> 14:38.673
Well, she runs her mouth,
that one.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.145
Fuck her.

14:41.180 --> 14:44.240
Carm got sick.
Nice touch.

14:44.283 --> 14:46.183
lt was a business
obligation, Artie.

14:46.218 --> 14:49.654
Uh-oh. Last time l heard that,
l had to call the fire department.

14:49.688 --> 14:51.781
Well, maybe you need another fresh start
to fuck up.

14:54.159 --> 14:56.684
l should go.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.754
- Oh, come on, come on.
- No.

14:58.797 --> 15:00.958
- l'm sorry. Have another one, come on.
- Forget it.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.525
l know where
your heart is.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.662
l gotta plan
the menu for tomorrow.

15:10.276 --> 15:14.076
Fasanella,
my old man's a meat guy.

15:14.113 --> 15:17.048
He said that the restaurant business
was like keeping an elephant.

15:17.082 --> 15:20.540
lt costs a fortune and sooner or later
it shits on your head.

15:21.887 --> 15:24.185
l miss him.

15:24.223 --> 15:27.715
Hector had to trim
three inches off the fiorentinas.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.285
Great. We can't even get
the good meat anymore.

15:30.329 --> 15:32.889
Fucking Western Beef
is leaving us for dead.

15:34.633 --> 15:37.227
l wanted you to call
their guy, but you were on the floor

15:37.269 --> 15:39.134
talking to the Cohens'
mother-in-law.

15:39.171 --> 15:41.696
You can't deal with the Western Beef
guy yourself,

15:41.740 --> 15:43.765
my blushing flower?

15:43.809 --> 15:46.869
lt's not
the same from me.

15:46.912 --> 15:48.880
And Arthur,

15:48.914 --> 15:50.973
the chatting

15:51.016 --> 15:53.143
with the guests...

15:53.185 --> 15:54.675
Again, that's it.

15:54.720 --> 15:57.450
lt's not Hector or the meat
or these assholes

15:57.489 --> 16:00.890
that are always looking
for the next hot thing. lt's me.

16:00.926 --> 16:03.895
Limit it to a quick
visit at coffee.

16:03.929 --> 16:06.864
People wanna talk
to each other, not you.

16:06.899 --> 16:09.993
Really? You know better
than New Jersey Zagat--

16:10.035 --> 16:13.334
''Arthur Bucco,
warm and convivial host''?

16:31.724 --> 16:33.885
Yeah, we're here
right now.

16:33.926 --> 16:37.418
Sure, the broad strokes.
Perfect.

16:37.463 --> 16:40.489
Kingsley's agent says
we grab lunch tomorrow, poolside.

16:40.532 --> 16:42.762
- That guy, Jay?
- Yeah, l got him out of some trouble

16:42.801 --> 16:44.268
on a party yacht
down in the Keys.

16:44.303 --> 16:48.205
Ben Kingsley, can he do
a New Jersey accent?

16:48.240 --> 16:50.470
Welcome
to the Viceroy.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.977
l usually send
the bags up, hit the bar,

16:53.012 --> 16:54.946
decompress a little,
unless you're against it.

16:54.980 --> 16:57.813
- What are you talking about?
- You're in AA.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.580
You gave the stewardess an earful
when she put down the champagne.

17:00.619 --> 17:02.712
l just don't wanna make you feel
uncomfortable.

17:04.757 --> 17:07.624
Relax.
l can deal with it.

17:07.659 --> 17:09.523
Be careful
with this wine,

17:09.560 --> 17:12.587
because the way
you two are looking at each other,

17:12.631 --> 17:15.656
pretty soon
we're gonna have to...

17:15.701 --> 17:18.464
put a high chair
right here.

17:24.675 --> 17:26.837
Did you clip the daily-special cards
to all the menus?

17:31.150 --> 17:33.243
Hey, Artie,

17:33.285 --> 17:35.185
come here.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.882
You ready to order?

17:37.923 --> 17:39.584
Why you kicking
her ass like that?

17:39.625 --> 17:42.219
lf you're referring
to the fact that she's my employee

17:42.261 --> 17:45.059
and l'm telling her what to do, last
time l checked, that's the way it works.

17:45.097 --> 17:47.930
She thinks you want her to cry.
l said not true.

17:47.966 --> 17:49.593
She told you that?

17:49.635 --> 17:51.569
'Cause you two
talk all the time.

17:51.603 --> 17:54.163
- Yeah. So what?
- So, maybe you should hire her.

17:54.206 --> 17:55.696
l know
how to treat people.

17:55.741 --> 17:59.370
- You're a people person, obviously.
- l am.

17:59.411 --> 18:01.641
And when they're good to me,
they get treats.

18:01.680 --> 18:04.774
And when they're not,
well, l got this severance thing l do.

18:04.817 --> 18:06.842
lt's a complete break,
actually.

18:09.421 --> 18:11.218
l get it.

18:11.256 --> 18:14.248
See, 'cause you talked around that
threat so much, l almost missed it.

18:14.293 --> 18:15.851
Sorry to interrupt
you guys,

18:15.894 --> 18:18.260
but, Arthur, you have
to plate the salmon.

18:20.332 --> 18:22.960
Arthur, the kid
is a hood, okay?

18:23.001 --> 18:24.935
lf he feels protective
of his girlfriend,

18:24.970 --> 18:26.597
you should just
leave it alone.

18:26.638 --> 18:28.538
She's a slow learner.

18:28.574 --> 18:31.065
She's a nice girl,
and as predicted,

18:31.110 --> 18:32.577
the customers love her

18:32.611 --> 18:35.011
with her little stories
from the old country.

18:35.047 --> 18:36.742
You are just
picking on her.

18:36.782 --> 18:39.376
lt's disgusting.
He's a married man.

18:52.331 --> 18:56.233
So it's 500 for the hour,
300 for half.

18:56.268 --> 18:58.828
And if you wanna keep
skiing, that's extra.

18:58.871 --> 19:01.965
All right, Eden,
how's about 400 for 40

19:02.007 --> 19:05.875
and four more lines
and then we'll take it from there?

19:05.911 --> 19:08.311
That'll work.

19:19.191 --> 19:20.988
Fuckin'-a.

19:21.026 --> 19:22.653
Those are
some amazing tits.

19:22.694 --> 19:25.822
Thank you, sweetie.

19:29.801 --> 19:33.464
Carlo's running late.
Route 23, they think there's a sniper.

19:35.774 --> 19:38.641
Listen,
the other night--

19:38.677 --> 19:40.542
it's this place.
You know, the rope's

19:40.579 --> 19:43.207
a little tight
at my collar.

19:43.248 --> 19:46.274
Down 40/%
from last year.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.613
- You need a little help?
- From you? God no.

19:50.656 --> 19:52.487
Oh, there's the gratitude
l was looking for.

19:52.524 --> 19:55.789
No, l mean l'm not
at that point, thank God.

19:55.827 --> 19:58.057
But thank you.

19:58.096 --> 20:00.121
Well, listen, the other day
l was driving along

20:00.165 --> 20:02.565
and l was thinking
about your little problem.

20:02.601 --> 20:04.967
How about a little promotion?
A coupon, two-for-one?

20:05.003 --> 20:07.528
Two-fers, wow.

20:07.573 --> 20:10.303
You mean, like you get
a free spaghetti and meatballs

20:10.342 --> 20:12.742
if you bring another cheap gomer
douchebag in here?

20:12.778 --> 20:15.645
How about an early-bird special?
Salad wagon?

20:15.681 --> 20:18.411
This is a fine dining establishment.
l'll give it back to the bank

20:18.450 --> 20:20.111
before l turn it
into a fucking lHOP.

20:20.152 --> 20:22.484
Just send the waiter
over here.

20:22.521 --> 20:25.854
You wanna help me so badly?
Try paying your tab.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.449
- Excuse me?
- That little roast

20:27.492 --> 20:30.461
you and the waste management people
threw for Dick Barone when he got sick--

20:30.495 --> 20:32.554
40 fucking garbagemen
from around the country.

20:32.598 --> 20:34.691
Of course you paid
Pat Cooper.

20:34.733 --> 20:37.258
You paid
the entertainment.

21:16.308 --> 21:19.277
Afternoon. We're looking
for Arthur Bucco.

21:19.311 --> 21:22.075
- That's me.
- Dave Kloski. This is Jim Hollings.

21:25.417 --> 21:28.250
American Express?
Funny, l had you two for cops.

21:28.287 --> 21:31.154
ln a past life.
Actually we're here to investigate

21:31.189 --> 21:34.488
some recent irregularities in charge
activity here at Nuevo Vesuvio.

21:34.526 --> 21:36.289
''Nuovo.''
lrregularities?

21:36.328 --> 21:39.229
Well, there is credit card fraud
going on in this restaurant.

21:39.264 --> 21:42.131
- That's impossible.
- Based on cardholder disputes,

21:42.167 --> 21:45.000
we show nine hits in this locus
that precede fraudulent activity.

21:45.037 --> 21:47.198
- What does that mean?
- People's card numbers were copied

21:47.239 --> 21:50.140
and those numbers were used to rack up
thousands of dollars in phony charges.

21:50.175 --> 21:53.008
Wait, you think l'm ripping off
my own customers? That's insane.

21:53.045 --> 21:55.138
Were these meals
actually served?

21:57.883 --> 21:59.441
Shit.

21:59.484 --> 22:02.044
Councilman Carillo?
That was just two weeks ago.

22:02.087 --> 22:03.611
So you understand
we have to suspend

22:03.655 --> 22:05.919
the use of our cards here
pending an investigation.

22:05.957 --> 22:07.925
Suspend?
You're cutting me off?

22:07.959 --> 22:09.483
What's going on?

22:09.528 --> 22:11.758
They're from Amex.
No more charges.

22:11.797 --> 22:15.198
- What?!
- Someone's stealing!

22:15.233 --> 22:17.565
Guys, this is like 30/%
of my business here

22:17.602 --> 22:19.331
and l can't fucking
spare it right now!

22:19.371 --> 22:22.363
Artie, please don't curse.
The minute you use profanity,

22:22.407 --> 22:25.308
you give them the high moral ground
to do whatever they please.

22:25.344 --> 22:27.107
We need copies
of your reservations

22:27.145 --> 22:29.670
and a list of anyone who has access
to customer plastic.

22:33.819 --> 22:37.050
l'm just asking, Jay.

22:37.089 --> 22:39.421
Well, tell me again.

22:39.458 --> 22:42.086
Why am l meeting
with these chaps?

22:43.428 --> 22:46.886
Oh! Oh, bollocks, Jay.
Uh-- bollocks!

22:50.535 --> 22:52.400
Oh, please.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.003
Anyway, we appreciate
that your time

22:59.044 --> 23:00.978
is less than limited,
so l'll cut to the chase.

23:01.012 --> 23:05.039
Log line-- ''The Ring'' meets
''The Godfather.''

23:05.083 --> 23:08.143
Wiseguy-- murdered,
l guess you could say--

23:08.186 --> 23:10.518
seeks revenge on the man
who ordered it.

23:10.555 --> 23:12.022
You would play that man.

23:12.057 --> 23:13.922
Which man?

23:13.959 --> 23:15.927
Who are we kidding here?

23:15.961 --> 23:18.555
You're Ben Kingsley.
You'd play the boss.

23:18.597 --> 23:22.089
l heard this idea--
l call Jay and l say,

23:22.134 --> 23:24.534
''Sir Ben Kingsley,
no one else.''

23:24.569 --> 23:28.300
Well, you know, as ever,
it's script-dependent.

23:30.509 --> 23:33.000
Oh, we got a sensational
writer-- JT Dolan.

23:33.044 --> 23:35.512
l'm embarrassed.
l haven't heard of him.

23:35.547 --> 23:38.539
He's from TV--
''Nash Bridges,'' ''Hooperman,''

23:38.583 --> 23:41.017
and ''Law & Order,
the SUV.''

23:41.052 --> 23:42.849
So there's a script?

23:42.888 --> 23:44.685
We wanted to surmise
your interest

23:44.723 --> 23:47.123
and then tailor the part
to your specificities.

23:48.827 --> 23:51.557
No one plays a tough,
ruthless, hardhearted prick like you do.

23:51.596 --> 23:53.530
You got it down,
trust me.

23:53.565 --> 23:55.396
l take that
as quite a compliment.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.834
Sure.
''Sexy Beast''?

23:57.869 --> 24:00.235
Now, we do have
a shortlist of directors.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.399
We could go A-list
down the horror genre--

24:02.441 --> 24:04.204
Ridley, Tobe Hooper.

24:04.242 --> 24:07.973
Or we could try to find
the next James Wan. He did ''Saw.''

24:08.013 --> 24:09.913
Did you see that?
Fuckin' brutal.

24:09.948 --> 24:12.416
Betty?

24:12.451 --> 24:16.012
lt's Ben.
How are you?

24:16.054 --> 24:18.249
What on earth
are you doing out here?

24:18.290 --> 24:20.258
Oh, l don't know.

24:22.494 --> 24:25.759
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce
Miss Lauren Bacall.

24:25.797 --> 24:28.789
Lauren, this is Carmine Tazzi
and Christopher...

24:28.834 --> 24:30.734
...Moltisanti.
Huge fan.

24:30.769 --> 24:32.634
- Thank you.
- ''Lupertazzi.''

24:32.671 --> 24:34.605
You were great
in ''The Haves and Have-Nots.''

24:34.639 --> 24:37.574
Oh yes, dear Howard Hawks.
Thank you.

24:37.609 --> 24:40.669
l'm a presenter
at one of these award shows--

24:40.712 --> 24:42.680
ShoWest,
some bullshit.

24:42.714 --> 24:45.740
Oh, l did one of those years ago,
after ''Death and the Maiden,'' l think.

24:45.784 --> 24:48.048
They do take good care
of you, though.

24:48.086 --> 24:50.884
l have a shiatsu
in about 10 minutes.

24:50.922 --> 24:53.948
- Wow.
- But let's catch up.

24:53.992 --> 24:55.584
Absolutely.
Great to see you.

24:55.627 --> 24:58.357
- Thank you.
- As always.

24:58.396 --> 25:01.024
- So nice meeting both of you.
- Enjoy your success.

25:04.636 --> 25:07.469
Uh, that reminds me,
l have a scheduling problem.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.633
This meeting was last minute
and l'm supposed to be

25:09.674 --> 25:12.006
at the Luxury Lounge
at 2:00.

25:12.043 --> 25:15.206
Yeah, but we haven't even gotten
to the particulars yet.

25:15.247 --> 25:17.579
We'll walk with you.

25:20.719 --> 25:22.687
l think this is
going very well.

25:22.721 --> 25:24.518
You okay? You seem
a bit distracted.

25:24.556 --> 25:27.889
lt's fucking Sir Ben Kingsley is all.
Lauren Bacall.

25:33.732 --> 25:36.963
- Yo.
- Murmur, l'm chipping here major.

25:37.002 --> 25:38.663
Get on a plane.

25:38.703 --> 25:41.604
Sir Ben Kingsley
and... guests.

25:41.640 --> 25:44.074
Janine will
take you around.

25:44.109 --> 25:48.603
Hi, Janine.
Ben Kingsley.

25:48.647 --> 25:50.547
We're offering
the full services

25:50.582 --> 25:52.846
of the spa today,
including massage.

25:52.884 --> 25:56.786
Listen, we're thinking about Sam
Rockwell for the younger guy.

25:56.821 --> 25:58.618
- ls that a good chemistry for you?
- Hmm.

25:58.657 --> 26:00.750
May l offer you
champagne?

26:00.792 --> 26:02.783
Maybe later.

26:11.970 --> 26:15.428
This is Yael from Cosabella Lingerie.
Sir Ben Kingsley.

26:15.473 --> 26:16.997
l'll take an extra large
in these.

26:18.443 --> 26:22.379
For a man, White & Warm is giving
this cashmere throw,

26:22.414 --> 26:25.850
great for the airplane,
and here, one for the car.

26:25.884 --> 26:28.876
- Thanks, Yael.
- They charge this shit to the room?

26:28.920 --> 26:31.445
- Hmm?
- This is Carla from Oris.

26:31.489 --> 26:33.855
Men's and women's,
sporty and dressy.

26:33.892 --> 26:37.123
A lot of guys are going
with the classic stainless chrono.

26:37.162 --> 26:40.654
Oh, my godson would love that.
He's having his birthday in three weeks.

26:40.699 --> 26:44.294
- But for me...
- This is elegant.

26:44.336 --> 26:46.201
- Really is.
- Take the chrono too?

26:46.237 --> 26:49.400
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

26:54.713 --> 26:56.578
ls all
this shit free?

26:56.615 --> 26:59.049
l'm gettin' that.

27:02.887 --> 27:06.152
''True Crime,
New York City.''

27:11.863 --> 27:14.457
Pam has
a huge crush on you.

27:14.499 --> 27:16.228
Thanks, Pam.

27:16.267 --> 27:18.667
So Kingsley,
they do this all the time?

27:18.703 --> 27:20.796
- lt's Sir Ben, actually.
- Sorry.

27:20.839 --> 27:24.104
A couple of times a year,
mainly clustered around award seasons.

27:24.142 --> 27:26.235
How is that even
fuckin' possible?

27:26.277 --> 27:28.211
l know.
lt's embarrassing, isn't it?

27:28.246 --> 27:30.407
- l know l have one of these.
- Shelly from iRiver.

27:30.448 --> 27:32.643
l don't know
if you have this one.

27:32.684 --> 27:34.447
lt's got 20 gigs of space
in a tiny package.

27:34.486 --> 27:37.853
That's 80 hours of video
or 600 hours of music.

27:37.889 --> 27:40.119
Shelly, can l get
one of these?

27:40.158 --> 27:43.184
- Here you go, Sir Ben.
- Thank you, Shelly.

27:43.228 --> 27:47.494
Sir Ben, you've got
a meeting with Doug in 10, so...

27:47.532 --> 27:49.625
Hey, guys,

27:49.668 --> 27:51.363
looks like l ate up
all our time here.

27:51.403 --> 27:53.268
What do you say
we catch up in New York?

27:53.304 --> 27:55.499
You got a lot
of tables left.

27:55.540 --> 27:57.508
We're gonna make
that work, Sir Ben.

27:57.542 --> 27:59.373
They're giving away
a Caddy over there!

27:59.411 --> 28:01.936
Well, no, it's just a test-drive
for a couple of weeks.

28:01.980 --> 28:05.279
You know, my family
gave me some sunglasses for Christmas

28:05.316 --> 28:08.342
so why don't you
have these?

28:08.386 --> 28:09.876
l bet they'll look
great on you, Chris.

28:09.921 --> 28:11.252
l don't know.
You think?

28:11.289 --> 28:13.553
Sir Ben, can we get
a shot?

28:23.468 --> 28:25.629
The thing, the Arabs.

28:25.670 --> 28:28.195
Chris wanted me
to take care of you while he's away.

28:28.239 --> 28:30.173
Cecil B DeMoltisanti
there.

28:32.310 --> 28:35.074
- This is one week?
- Yeah, Murmur caught some big ones.

28:35.113 --> 28:37.911
You're going to see your girlfriend
over at Vesuvio?

28:37.949 --> 28:39.507
Yeah.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.519
All right.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.544
Uh...

28:44.589 --> 28:47.251
Give this to Artie.
Put it on my tab.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.893
We're not here
to accuse anybody,

28:51.930 --> 28:55.388
'cause Mainie and l
like to think of you all as family.

28:55.433 --> 28:57.492
And this is
very serious.

28:57.535 --> 29:00.732
lt is, but know
that as family

29:00.772 --> 29:02.239
you'll be treated
with respect

29:02.273 --> 29:05.436
and, if need be,
forgiveness.

29:09.280 --> 29:11.271
Hector,
and you, mustache...

29:11.316 --> 29:14.217
You got
something to say?

29:14.252 --> 29:18.211
We have no intention of pressing
charges. lt's just gotta stop.

29:18.256 --> 29:20.918
That's all we want.
Any questions?

29:23.561 --> 29:27.657
Understand this is not
about a 42-oz. jar of Moroccan olives

29:27.699 --> 29:29.724
or a couple of rolls
of toilet paper here.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.929
- This is our livelihoods.
- Are you looking at me?

29:31.970 --> 29:33.938
Nobody's looking
at anybody.

29:33.972 --> 29:36.702
- l didn't take the toilet paper.
- But the olives?

29:36.741 --> 29:39.175
l'm joking here.

29:39.210 --> 29:42.407
l'm just saying
if you don't come clean to us,

29:42.447 --> 29:44.244
those investigators,

29:44.282 --> 29:46.273
well, they just might
question the honesty

29:46.317 --> 29:48.410
of somebody
that wears a coat

29:48.453 --> 29:50.819
- pulled from the lost-and-found.
- Fuck this!

29:50.855 --> 29:52.345
- No, fuck you!
- Arthur...

29:52.390 --> 29:54.358
l don't know which one of
you pieces of shit did this,

29:54.392 --> 29:56.622
- but l've been good to you!
- ...getting us nowhere.

29:56.661 --> 29:58.629
And you pay me back
with nonstop ass-rape!

29:58.663 --> 30:00.563
Well fuck all a' you!

30:13.378 --> 30:15.608
You know what?
Just forget it.

30:15.647 --> 30:18.582
l-- l'm so sorry,
everybody.

30:18.616 --> 30:22.814
Um, could you just get this cleaned up
so we can open? Thanks.

30:24.355 --> 30:26.118
No no. lt's very bad.

30:26.157 --> 30:28.250
They had
the credit card police.

30:28.293 --> 30:29.590
Those companies
are huge.

30:29.627 --> 30:32.095
They come on tough,
but in the end, they gotta eat it.

30:32.130 --> 30:34.496
Okay.

30:43.174 --> 30:44.937
Everything okay
in there?

30:44.976 --> 30:48.343
For once l'd like to eat
without you getting a call from work.

30:50.481 --> 30:53.279
Ah.

31:00.992 --> 31:02.983
God damn it.

31:18.309 --> 31:19.708
Motherfucker.

31:19.744 --> 31:21.336
Arthur!

31:21.379 --> 31:24.177
What do you want, a repeat performance
of the Fourth of July?

31:24.215 --> 31:25.910
That cop told you,

31:25.950 --> 31:28.384
no firing guns in
the borough limits.

31:28.419 --> 31:30.410
l brought those
arugula seeds

31:30.455 --> 31:32.446
all the way back from ltaly
in my shaving kit.

31:35.960 --> 31:38.952
Eden, get the fuck
out of there!

31:38.997 --> 31:43.024
- Fuck off.
- l wasn't going through your purse!

31:43.067 --> 31:44.659
l was movin' it
and it fell.

31:44.702 --> 31:47.262
Go fuck yourself,
you guinea bastard!

31:52.410 --> 31:54.002
Good afternoon,
Mr. Moltisanti.

31:54.045 --> 31:56.013
Room 81 2, please.

32:01.819 --> 32:04.754
- Yes.
- Hey, Sir Kingsley.

32:04.789 --> 32:07.280
lt's Chris Moltisanti
from yesterday?

32:07.325 --> 32:08.952
l spoke with Jay

32:08.993 --> 32:11.393
and he's working on that
New York meeting right now.

32:11.429 --> 32:14.523
Fine, but that's not
what l'm calling about, though.

32:14.565 --> 32:17.033
That Luxury Lounge thing,
can you get me in there?

32:17.068 --> 32:19.866
l don't know. My publicist
handles all that stuff.

32:19.904 --> 32:22.372
- So, can you call 'em?
- l don't know

32:22.407 --> 32:25.399
how my publicist
can help you, you know?

32:25.443 --> 32:27.240
All right.

32:27.278 --> 32:30.406
Yeah, in the city then.
My partner went back.

32:30.448 --> 32:32.279
Friend of his died
recently. Guy's wife

32:32.317 --> 32:34.444
is having a breakdown.
He'll call you.

32:41.225 --> 32:44.217
That's security, Eden!
They're gonna blow that door open!

32:44.262 --> 32:46.355
Fuck you!

32:50.535 --> 32:53.663
- Fuck.
- l know, l gotta get it together.

32:53.705 --> 32:57.004
Black truffle doesn't have the intensity
of white so you gotta use more.

32:57.041 --> 32:59.942
l'll be at my investing club
at the Learning Annex with my cell

32:59.978 --> 33:03.414
if you have to call,
but try not to.

33:03.448 --> 33:06.178
Sandy,
about the meeting...

33:06.217 --> 33:08.048
- Oh, everybody knows you're upset.
- l know.

33:08.086 --> 33:10.680
But Alonzo's coat,
you told me that in confidence.

33:10.722 --> 33:12.189
l thought you
needed to know.

33:12.223 --> 33:14.987
l also think-- well,
it's probably nothing,

33:15.026 --> 33:18.484
but yesterday Martina
was showing off these Caovilla sandals.

33:20.164 --> 33:21.893
l know she makes
more than me,

33:21.933 --> 33:24.163
but they cost
like $600.

33:25.970 --> 33:27.938
You should get back
to the coatroom.

33:29.674 --> 33:32.541
Hold on a second.
l wanna ask you something.

33:37.582 --> 33:40.983
- l knew it.
- l'm sorry. l'll pay you back.

33:41.019 --> 33:44.113
- How could you do this to me?
- You were so mean to me.

33:44.155 --> 33:47.147
Like helping you find the apartment?
Teaching you to drive?

33:47.191 --> 33:50.388
As soon as you found out l wasn't going
to fuck you, you started picking on me.

33:50.428 --> 33:54.057
l wanna fuck you? You certainly have
a high opinion of yourself.

33:54.098 --> 33:56.396
You stare at me
like food.

33:56.434 --> 33:58.732
Well l never
fuck you.

33:58.770 --> 34:00.897
- l go to Benny and we laugh at you...
- Benny.

34:00.938 --> 34:02.667
...when l fuck him
in the pile of money

34:02.707 --> 34:04.766
that we take from
your stupid customers.

34:04.809 --> 34:07.243
You're fired.

34:07.278 --> 34:09.246
Oh yeah?
Oh, who's laughing now?

34:09.280 --> 34:12.147
What do you think? l can't press charges
'cause of my friendship with Tony?!

34:12.183 --> 34:13.844
Three months
you worked here!

34:13.885 --> 34:15.545
You think that doesn't go
on your permanent record?!

34:15.585 --> 34:18.418
We lead the world
in computerized data collection!

34:42.513 --> 34:44.447
Artie, you know
what time it is?

34:44.482 --> 34:47.042
- We need to talk.
- Now?

34:47.085 --> 34:48.949
My wife is pregnant.
She needs to sleep.

34:48.985 --> 34:51.351
Martina told me about your little
credit card business.

34:51.389 --> 34:53.219
Step outside, Ben.

34:54.792 --> 34:57.693
l'll be outside
a minute, honey.

34:59.597 --> 35:01.428
Look.

35:02.433 --> 35:04.594
You're upset,
all right?

35:04.635 --> 35:07.103
But it's not my fault
that little trick got greedy.

35:07.138 --> 35:08.833
Oh, so she's
a little trick, huh?

35:08.873 --> 35:11.137
l was gonna cut you in,
but now you're acting stupid.

35:11.175 --> 35:13.643
Regular people are
all fucking stupid.

35:21.919 --> 35:23.910
You want some more?!

35:30.128 --> 35:32.596
Piece of dogshit!
Little, crazy,

35:32.630 --> 35:34.996
motherfucking
meatball dogshit!

35:47.845 --> 35:50.177
Yeah, l'm stupid.

36:05.229 --> 36:07.629
Ho! There he is.

36:07.665 --> 36:09.656
How you doing?

36:09.700 --> 36:12.669
- Great, thanks.
- This is Murmur.

36:14.105 --> 36:16.869
- You heading to the pool?
- Massage.

36:16.908 --> 36:18.876
Oh.

36:18.910 --> 36:21.674
Listen. You get a chance to call about
that Luxury Lounge for me?

36:21.712 --> 36:23.703
Well, it's like
l explained...

36:24.982 --> 36:26.950
there's nothing very much
l can do about it.

36:26.984 --> 36:29.851
- They decide whom they give it to.
- Very important people,

36:29.887 --> 36:32.822
like you, right? 'Cause you're a very
important person.

36:32.857 --> 36:34.848
To them, l guess.

36:37.195 --> 36:40.289
Murmur's an interesting name.
What's the genesis?

36:40.331 --> 36:43.789
l had a heart murmur
when l was a kid.

36:43.834 --> 36:45.961
They just keep
handing stuff out, huh?

36:46.003 --> 36:47.971
The coolest shit
in the world

36:48.005 --> 36:49.836
to the people
who need it the least.

36:58.182 --> 37:00.673
Look. l think you've
misunderstood something.

37:00.718 --> 37:03.448
l give most
of that stuff away

37:03.487 --> 37:06.320
to homeless shelters,
the rest l give to charity auctions.

37:06.357 --> 37:09.292
- Not to your godson?
- l agree with you,

37:09.327 --> 37:11.727
the whole thing's obscene,
and it's nothing

37:11.762 --> 37:13.787
compared to the situation
at award shows.

37:13.831 --> 37:17.232
Presenters get about $30,000 worth of
merchandise

37:17.268 --> 37:19.031
in those baskets.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.867
That's a year's salary
for some people.

37:20.905 --> 37:22.736
Go figure.

37:22.773 --> 37:25.264
Hopefully we can spread
some of that lolly around.

37:26.911 --> 37:28.708
We'll get you
that script.

37:38.522 --> 37:40.456
Hell of a tub here, guys.

37:40.491 --> 37:43.392
Sea, sun. l'm gonna
make it my second home.

37:43.427 --> 37:46.760
- Anybody else hungry? Huh?
- We'll get lunch started.

37:46.797 --> 37:49.425
- Artie, another margarita?
- l could say no, but l won't.

38:09.120 --> 38:11.088
You lost
your fucking mind?

38:11.122 --> 38:14.023
The shit you're in with that kid,
which you brought on yourself.

38:14.058 --> 38:16.219
Brought on myself?
Oh, l suppose you let

38:16.260 --> 38:18.922
a certain element into your world,
you're asking for it.

38:18.963 --> 38:21.454
- Oh!
- Jesus fucking Christ, Tony,

38:21.499 --> 38:22.989
how could you pull
that scam at my place?

38:23.034 --> 38:25.798
Come on, you know l never would've
let that happen if l'd known.

38:25.836 --> 38:28.202
You're innocent, l get it.
l'm just another victim

38:28.239 --> 38:30.639
- of Benny Fazio, criminal mastermind.
- That's right.

38:30.675 --> 38:33.644
And once you found out,
instead of putting him in the E.R.,

38:33.678 --> 38:36.169
you should've come to me.
He says he's gonna kill you, Artie.

38:36.213 --> 38:38.841
l can't take
American Express now, Ton'.

38:38.883 --> 38:42.216
You know what that means? l have
to start with the fucking two-fers.

38:42.253 --> 38:45.279
My accountant insisted.
Are you happy?

38:45.323 --> 38:47.086
Life's not fair.
Right, l know.

38:47.124 --> 38:49.649
But somehow l believed my dad's crap
about honest work.

38:49.694 --> 38:53.061
He used to say
to me, ''You'll see.

38:53.097 --> 38:55.395
Pays off in the end.''

38:55.433 --> 38:56.957
What a joke.

39:04.108 --> 39:06.372
l hate to see you like this,
you know that.

39:06.410 --> 39:09.208
'Cause you start
thinking crazy shit.

39:11.615 --> 39:13.480
Who's hungry?

39:22.460 --> 39:25.190
- Yeah?
- Ben Kingsley passed.

39:25.229 --> 39:27.094
Fuck.

39:28.299 --> 39:30.267
You know, l tried
to be his friend,

39:30.301 --> 39:32.360
l sent a muffin basket
with the script,

39:32.403 --> 39:34.303
l tried everything.

39:40.411 --> 39:42.641
You can kill me after
if you want,

39:42.680 --> 39:45.274
- but he's a fucking dead man.
- Calm down, Ben.

39:45.316 --> 39:48.547
He came to my house,
Tony, where my wife was watching TV.

39:48.586 --> 39:51.749
My wife, who's carrying
my unborn son.

39:51.789 --> 39:54.257
l'm gonna take him to
that warehouse in Paterson

39:54.291 --> 39:56.589
- and drive fucking...
- Nails into his balls. l know.

39:56.627 --> 39:59.152
l heard you
the first time.

40:04.201 --> 40:06.726
- You're having a son, huh?
- They showed us his cannoli

40:06.771 --> 40:10.263
on the ultrasound
like a month ago.

40:10.307 --> 40:12.832
That's beautiful.

40:14.879 --> 40:17.279
Oh, congratulations.

40:17.314 --> 40:19.407
Thank you.

40:19.450 --> 40:21.577
l'm gonna tell you
this once--

40:21.619 --> 40:24.053
it's over.
You drop it.

40:24.088 --> 40:27.717
And frankly you should be very happy
l'm not gonna tax you.

40:27.758 --> 40:30.852
l mean beside the fact you know
l grew up with the man,

40:30.895 --> 40:32.863
you don't shit
where you eat.

40:32.897 --> 40:35.229
And you really don't shit
where l eat.

40:35.266 --> 40:37.962
l know, and l'm sorry
about that, but--

40:38.002 --> 40:40.095
And your parents'
anniversary party?

40:40.137 --> 40:42.401
lt's not going to be at Da Giovanni's.
lt's gonna be at Vesuvio.

40:42.440 --> 40:45.273
What? Tony,
look at my face.

40:45.309 --> 40:48.107
He's going to apologize
to you, and give you a rate.

40:49.780 --> 40:53.443
He's hurtin' too.
And it's the least you can do.

40:57.688 --> 41:00.282
Well Ms. Bacall, your limo
is second in line there.

41:00.324 --> 41:02.792
Oh, well l can take it
from here.

41:02.827 --> 41:04.954
- You sure?
- Yeah, thank you so much.

41:04.995 --> 41:06.690
- Okay, you're welcome.
- Good night.

41:06.730 --> 41:08.425
Night.

41:12.203 --> 41:14.330
- Get the fuck away from me!
- What are you doing?!

41:16.173 --> 41:18.073
Somebody help us!

41:18.108 --> 41:20.303
Those guys!

41:23.481 --> 41:25.711
Ms. Bacall,
don't move.

41:25.749 --> 41:29.150
Yes, an ambulance
by Robinsons-May.

41:29.186 --> 41:33.179
Oh Jesus,
my fucking arm.

41:38.929 --> 41:41.090
- Hmm?
- No.

41:43.501 --> 41:45.264
There's a line outside.

41:47.037 --> 41:50.200
Okay, push the scampi. Wholesaler
says they gotta get eaten tonight.

41:50.241 --> 41:53.904
And don't spread out too much. We still
got the Fazio party in the banquet room.

41:57.114 --> 41:59.207
Okay, Sandy.
Open the door.

42:03.053 --> 42:05.817
Hello. Welcome.

42:05.856 --> 42:08.154
Do you have
low-salt selections?

42:11.795 --> 42:13.353
Ahem--

42:15.799 --> 42:18.427
Ma, Pop,
order whatever you want.

42:18.469 --> 42:20.937
l'm having
that loin of veal.

42:20.971 --> 42:23.201
That's
the other place, Ma.

42:28.846 --> 42:30.313
This the young couple?

42:30.347 --> 42:32.247
Yes, my mom and dad.

42:32.283 --> 42:33.773
Cent'anni!

42:33.817 --> 42:36.752
- Hundred years!
- Cent'anni!

42:38.522 --> 42:41.821
Well, l hope you all enjoy.
You're all set for wine, cocktails?

42:43.260 --> 42:45.490
- Nothing?
- Fine, thanks.

42:47.631 --> 42:50.794
Benny, can l get
you a Martina?

42:50.834 --> 42:52.529
- Excuse me?
- A Martina.

42:52.570 --> 42:55.368
lt's like a Martini,
but it's from Albania.

42:55.406 --> 42:56.873
Hmm. l never heard
of it.

42:56.907 --> 42:59.501
Well, apparently
they go down real easy.

42:59.543 --> 43:01.204
Right, Ben?

43:03.747 --> 43:06.011
We're gonna look
at the menu.

43:07.084 --> 43:09.279
Good enough.

43:12.790 --> 43:15.987
- You order for me.
- Fine. The monkfish.

43:16.026 --> 43:18.460
There's such
a strange consistency.

43:29.073 --> 43:31.405
- Ow!
- ln front of my wife?!

43:31.442 --> 43:33.535
Fuck!

43:33.577 --> 43:35.477
Jesus! Fuck, my hand!

43:35.512 --> 43:38.413
Shit! Oh God!
Oh fuck!

43:40.084 --> 43:42.075
Fuck! My hand!

43:44.521 --> 43:47.456
Oh my God!
Oh my God!

43:47.491 --> 43:51.655
Oh my God, Arthur!
Somebody call 911 please!

44:19.623 --> 44:21.955
Look at this.

44:29.667 --> 44:32.830
l had no idea.
l'd have booked another flight.

44:32.870 --> 44:34.929
Fuck.

44:41.211 --> 44:43.076
Where is everybody?

44:43.113 --> 44:44.910
My father-in-law
don't wanna come.

44:44.948 --> 44:46.916
Him and Carm
aren't speaking.

44:46.950 --> 44:50.408
- How's the meathook?
- Had to be my fuckin' saute hand, huh?

44:50.454 --> 44:52.615
Why, you got an okay
crowd here today.

44:52.656 --> 44:54.851
Sunday pasta's
the last thing to go.

44:54.892 --> 44:57.019
The place is on life-support
ever since word got out

44:57.061 --> 44:58.892
to the regulars
about their credit cards.

44:58.929 --> 45:01.523
And my staff is pissed off
about Martina leaving.

45:01.565 --> 45:04.329
Benny did a real
number here, Tony.

45:04.368 --> 45:07.599
Who knows?
Maybe it's cursed. The fire, then this.

45:07.638 --> 45:09.230
Will you stop talkin'
like an old lady?

45:09.273 --> 45:11.639
- Artie.
- No go, huh?

45:11.675 --> 45:14.269
He's just
being dramatic.

45:15.546 --> 45:17.207
- How are you, sweetie?
- Better.

45:17.247 --> 45:19.875
And Carm,
the flowers...

45:21.885 --> 45:24.877
Tonight, only the best

45:24.922 --> 45:26.514
for the best people.

45:33.897 --> 45:35.728
Hmm, that's excellent.

45:42.740 --> 45:45.106
Hey, be careful you two,

45:45.142 --> 45:47.042
because the way
you two are looking at each other,

45:47.077 --> 45:50.171
pretty soon we'll have
to put a high chair over here.

45:50.214 --> 45:53.047
Like the icing on a cake, okay?
Capisce?

45:53.083 --> 45:55.176
Keep your thumbs
out of the food.

46:00.357 --> 46:02.757
We gotta talk
about your problem.

46:02.793 --> 46:04.624
Oh, great.
Another idea.

46:04.661 --> 46:06.788
How 'bout a strolling accordionist?

46:09.566 --> 46:11.693
l'm gonna give you the name
of a good psychiatrist.

46:11.735 --> 46:14.101
She's ltalian.
You'll like her.

46:15.339 --> 46:17.933
You know what?
You go about in pity for yourself.

46:17.975 --> 46:20.535
- l go about in pity for myself?
- Yeah.

46:20.577 --> 46:22.636
l gotta tell you,
Bodhisattva,

46:22.679 --> 46:24.738
that is fucking
priceless.

46:24.782 --> 46:27.342
Use the other door.

46:27.384 --> 46:29.716
You bitch and you moan
and you blame

46:29.753 --> 46:31.846
everybody else
for your problems,

46:31.889 --> 46:35.985
instead of maybe... not letting
the Mexicans do all the cooking for you

46:36.026 --> 46:39.291
or, l don't know, changing the menu
or changing the decor.

46:39.329 --> 46:42.492
l guess because you know how to eat,
you know how to run a restaurant.

46:45.169 --> 46:47.364
On one of the bleakest
nights of my life,

46:47.404 --> 46:52.205
after the shit with my
mother and that fuckin' storm outside,

46:52.242 --> 46:54.938
l came here
to this place.

46:54.978 --> 46:57.845
l sat out there
with Carm and my two kids

46:57.881 --> 47:00.475
and we ate and we drank
and we were so happy to be here,

47:00.517 --> 47:02.678
more than any other
place in the world.

47:02.719 --> 47:05.415
And you know l'm gonna
eat here until l fall off the chair.

47:08.125 --> 47:10.184
But in business,
sometimes shit happens.

47:10.227 --> 47:12.718
The playing field
changes, whatever.

47:12.763 --> 47:15.960
And you gotta do whatever you gotta do
to keep your dick up.

47:18.836 --> 47:21.669
lf you hate it here so much,
why don't you go to Da Giovanni?

47:21.705 --> 47:24.333
See if he'll cook you that bland shit
for your shot-up pancreas.

47:29.947 --> 47:31.744
l'll tell you one thing

47:31.782 --> 47:33.750
and this is very hard--

47:33.784 --> 47:35.615
nobody wants
to hear you talk.

47:35.652 --> 47:39.486
They're trying to eat out there
and you come along

47:39.523 --> 47:42.356
with your corny jokes
and your stupid stories.

47:43.961 --> 47:46.259
Just stay
in the kitchen.

47:46.296 --> 47:48.696
That'd be a start.

48:02.913 --> 48:04.676
Hey.

48:07.951 --> 48:10.647
You wouldn't believe
what these people in the business get,

48:10.687 --> 48:13.019
totally fuckin'
absolutely gratis.

48:13.056 --> 48:15.149
Yeah, l hear the streets
are paved with hand jobs.

48:15.192 --> 48:18.650
Right. l scored
some major swag.

48:18.695 --> 48:20.890
A little taste for you.

48:22.799 --> 48:25.029
Trip to Australia,
first-class vouchers,

48:25.068 --> 48:26.899
some kind of
golf resort.

48:26.937 --> 48:29.428
Looks like Sarasota.

48:29.473 --> 48:33.034
After what,
a 20-hour flight? No.

48:49.192 --> 48:51.456
That's for a pocket dog.

48:56.633 --> 48:58.328
How'd it go
with the movie star?

48:58.368 --> 49:01.428
He was all over us,
but l don't think he's right.

49:01.471 --> 49:04.440
We made some great contacts.
Plus we saw Lindsay Lohan.

49:04.474 --> 49:06.135
Total piece of ass.

49:08.712 --> 49:10.612
You hear Artie
burned his hand?

49:10.647 --> 49:14.777
Yeah. Him and Benny.
How crazy is that?

49:14.818 --> 49:16.786
- He okay?
- A layer of skin

49:16.820 --> 49:18.685
came off his hand
like a glove.

49:18.722 --> 49:21.953
But, they said, you know,
no scarring, no grafts.

49:21.992 --> 49:24.688
- Lucky.
- Hmm.

49:26.129 --> 49:28.359
Well, not for nothin'.
l couldn't help but thinkin'

49:28.398 --> 49:31.959
if you were here
watching your crew,

49:32.002 --> 49:33.970
things wouldn't have gone
the way they did.

49:34.004 --> 49:36.029
You let me go, T.

49:36.073 --> 49:38.598
l asked you. Now it's my fault Artie
and Benny got into it?

49:38.642 --> 49:42.544
This is what l was concerned about,
Christopher, the loss of focus.

49:42.579 --> 49:45.104
Look...

49:45.148 --> 49:49.209
not many guys have had to make
the kind of sacrifice l did.

49:49.252 --> 49:51.743
How many times you gonna play
the Adriana card?

50:01.898 --> 50:04.025
Sandy just seated
a couple.

50:04.067 --> 50:05.762
Kitchen's closed.

50:05.802 --> 50:08.965
He said they were supposed to go
to the city but they had car trouble.

50:10.941 --> 50:12.704
Hector already left
to pick up his wife.

50:12.743 --> 50:15.211
Plus l got nothing
back here, Charm.

50:15.245 --> 50:17.304
They already opened
the bottle.

50:28.025 --> 50:29.925
They're gonna have to eat
what l give them.

51:22.612 --> 51:25.775
Arthur, a lot of people
don't like rabbit.

51:25.816 --> 51:27.306
My grandfather's way.

51:27.350 --> 51:29.045
Only with Provençal elements
l been thinking about.

51:29.086 --> 51:31.611
l thought you were taking
it to him at the home.

51:31.655 --> 51:35.421
Okay-- out.
l wanna get outta here tonight.
