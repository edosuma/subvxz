Previouslyon "One Tree Hill"...

00:02.020 --> 00:03.000
For you, miss Lauren.

00:03.200 --> 00:04.930
Thank you, Jamie.

00:04.970 --> 00:06.660
They're from my uncle skills.

00:06.740 --> 00:07.990
He thinks you're cute.

00:08.119 --> 00:11.500
Antwon "skills" Taylor
Crashing a 5-year-olds' dance?

00:11.550 --> 00:12.930
I was hoping to see you.

00:12.930 --> 00:15.390
I'm moving nino to shooting guard,and
I'm keeping you at the point.

00:15.470 --> 00:17.590
With me at the point,you're
Gonna get more chances to score.

00:17.670 --> 00:18.880
All right? I'll get you the ball.

00:18.960 --> 00:22.100
'Cause if you can do
That,the scouts will come.

00:22.900 --> 00:25.440
I have a letter for you
From your birth mother.

00:25.520 --> 00:27.900
You've been going to that
Coffee shop for months.

00:27.980 --> 00:32.420
You must want something from
Her,even if it's just closure.

00:32.479 --> 00:35.460
Peyton has aondition
Called placenta previa.

00:35.540 --> 00:38.100
Lucas, come on, what if
Everything doesn't go perfectly?

00:38.210 --> 00:42.050
She could die, and... And the baby,too.

The honorary title, Matthew
Ryan, the cure, audioslave,

00:56.230 --> 00:59.990
Haley James Scott --
They're all in here.

01:00.580 --> 01:03.020
It's music to set your life to.

01:03.140 --> 01:09.220
And...music always helps,no
Matter what you're going through.

01:09.380 --> 01:16.260
So,if you flunk a big test or
You have a really bad break-up...

01:18.830 --> 01:22.790
...or you just miss
Someone so bad,it hurts...

01:24.280 --> 01:26.360
...then listen to my playlist -

01:26.440 --> 01:30.400
"100 songs to save your
Life" -- and it should help.

01:31.620 --> 01:38.840
Oh,and there is this new artist that is really
Special,and her second album is just about to come out.

01:38.950 --> 01:41.470
So you should check her out.

01:41.700 --> 01:43.860
Her name's Mia Catalano.

01:49.450 --> 01:55.010
This road is anything but simple

01:55.170 --> 01:57.560
Twisted like a riddle

01:57.600 --> 02:02.000
I've seen high, and I've seen low

02:02.590 --> 02:08.430
So loud   the voices over my doubts

02:08.550 --> 02:11.020
Are telling me to give up

02:11.060 --> 02:15.310
To pack up and leave town

02:16.180 --> 02:21.940
But even so, I had to believe

02:22.020 --> 02:28.340
Oh, impossible means nothing to me

02:28.460 --> 02:31.210
So,can you lift me up?

02:31.290 --> 02:35.330
A best friend -- okay, this
One is so important.

02:35.530 --> 02:39.150
Choose wisely, okay?

02:39.250 --> 02:42.230
I got really lucky with mine.

02:42.310 --> 02:49.340
My best friend is funny...
Intelligent... Creative...

02:49.660 --> 02:56.530
Beautiful... And
Successful... And very kind.

02:58.020 --> 03:02.800
And she's also...
...impulsive,frustrating,

03:03.040 --> 03:06.140
Um...complicated,childish.

03:06.260 --> 03:10.100
But I would not have 
her any other way.

03:10.810 --> 03:16.810
And the best part about brooke davis
Is that she always puts friends first.

03:17.440 --> 03:22.860
So...if you are ever in any kind
Of trouble,now you know who to call.

03:24.270 --> 03:28.980
I can't think of anyone I would
Rather have watching over you.

03:33.330 --> 03:35.310
It's been a month, Brooke.

03:35.390 --> 03:37.080
You've got to stop
Spying on them like this.

03:37.150 --> 03:38.380
Thank you, concernicus.

03:38.450 --> 03:40.280
How would you know what 
I've been up to?

03:40.320 --> 03:42.600
'Cause I've been
Watching the both of you.

03:45.290 --> 03:48.600
Iced coffee with skim milk
-- it'll change your life.

03:53.030 --> 03:55.310
She's eating pecan pie.

03:55.660 --> 03:57.980
She doesn't even like  pecan pie.

03:59.190 --> 04:02.880
Being a kid without 
a mom really sucks.

04:03.120 --> 04:07.080
And I know this because
I've been there... Twice.

04:09.050 --> 04:13.680
And if you're watching this,then it
Means that you're  in that place, too.

04:15.210 --> 04:18.120
And I'm so sorry for that.

04:19.290 --> 04:24.590
But if you ever need a mom-and-dad
Fix,you have Nathan and haley for that.

04:26.930 --> 04:28.720
Gotcha! I gotcha now!

04:28.790 --> 04:30.900
No! No!

04:31.130 --> 04:32.420
Okay,easy.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.870
If he pees his pants, 
you're on laundry duty.

04:35.180 --> 04:36.160
You look pretty, mama.

04:36.280 --> 04:37.590
Oh, thanks, buddy.

04:37.670 --> 04:38.320
I got to go. I'm late.

04:38.390 --> 04:42.120
I got to pick up Mia from the studio and
Go over to Peyton's for her baby shower.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.480
Do you think you can drop him
Off on your way out of town?

04:44.560 --> 04:46.520
Lucas is gonna watch him.

04:46.570 --> 04:47.830
Sure, no problem.

04:47.910 --> 04:49.520
Thank you.

04:49.600 --> 04:51.410
I'm gonna miss you so much.

04:51.490 --> 04:52.420
Call me after the game,o kay?

04:52.460 --> 04:54.100
- Yeah.
- Okay bye.

04:54.220 --> 04:56.020
I'll see you later.
Peyton's waiting.

04:56.070 --> 04:57.020
- Bye.
- Bye! Bye.

04:57.140 --> 04:59.250
- Love you.
- I Love you, too.-

05:00.820 --> 05:03.770

'Cause I have overcome  
More than words will ever say

05:22.020 --> 05:25.820
And I've been given hope

05:25.900 --> 05:29.110
That there's a light on 
up the hall

05:29.190 --> 05:32.550
And that a day will come
When the fight is won

05:32.710 --> 05:38.940
And I think that day has just begun

05:39.300 --> 05:47.640
Oh,oh,just begun   lift me up

05:47.720 --> 05:52.860
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah   
yeah, yeah, oh

05:53.250 --> 05:56.920
Oh, oh, lift me up

05:57.070 --> 06:02.510
Lift me up, lift me up

06:02.590 --> 06:07.620
I really hope that we get to
Share all these things together.

06:08.630 --> 06:13.190
But just in case,
it's all right he.

06:13.850 --> 06:18.370
Now, there is just one
Thing... That I need from you.

06:22.330 --> 06:24.190
Please...

06:24.300 --> 06:31.050
Take very special care of your
Father... Because if I'm not around...

06:32.700 --> 06:38.630
He's gonna need you to take care
Of him,just like my dad needed me.

06:41.300 --> 06:45.950
So,love him... ...and
Take care of him...

06:47.640 --> 06:50.310
...and be kind to him.

06:50.510 --> 06:55.410
Just please... ...do that for me.

06:58.550 --> 07:00.490
Peyton, what is this?

07:03.590 --> 07:06.220
I just thought I should.

07:07.550 --> 07:12.650
No. No,you... You said
everything was gonna be okay.

07:13.010 --> 07:14.080
You said that.

07:14.170 --> 07:17.070
Okay, but, Luke, if it isn't, I want
our child to be able to remember me.

07:17.190 --> 07:18.250
It's just in case.

07:18.370 --> 07:21.470
Our child's not gonna
Have to remember you.

07:22.300 --> 07:24.850
Our child's gonna know you.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.930
We're not doing this, Peyton.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.110
Lucas.

07:28.230 --> 07:29.680
A death video?

07:29.760 --> 07:31.560
A sad box of stuff?

07:31.640 --> 07:34.470
I'm not having any of this, Peyton.

07:34.780 --> 07:37.340
I mean,what's next?

07:37.880 --> 07:41.220
I want to get married... Now.

07:41.890 --> 07:44.400
Absolutely not.

07:44.710 --> 07:46.880
You're supposed to be taking it easy.

07:47.080 --> 07:50.020
Okay, look,after you have this
baby and you're all better,

07:50.070 --> 07:53.720
Then -- then
We'll get married.

07:53.800 --> 07:54.450
I want to get married.

07:54.610 --> 07:58.590
Why?
Why is it so important to dit now?

07:58.860 --> 08:02.690
- because -- we're not doing
anything just in case,okay?

08:08.770 --> 08:10.540
I'll be in the garage.

08:12.890 --> 08:15.170
You should be in bed.

08:17.480 --> 08:19.570
Thank you!

08:19.810 --> 08:22.280
I love you,too, by the way.

08:36.460 --> 08:38.770
Remind me again what 
we're doing here?

08:38.970 --> 08:41.130
Know thy enemy, Brooke.

08:41.440 --> 08:47.170
Suit yourself,but this is our competitio and they're
cutting into our market share with these hideous things.

08:47.410 --> 08:50.580
Yeah,the appropriate
Word being "hideous.

08:50.740 --> 08:51.920
" don't be so dismissive.

08:51.960 --> 08:55.300
Maybe you should pay a visit to the
Manufacturer,get some inspiration.

08:55.810 --> 08:59.770
I have Sam,and Sam has
School,so I'm not going anywhere.

08:59.850 --> 09:03.770
Besides,i need to be here while
She's meeting with... You know who.

09:03.890 --> 09:07.150
You mean the biological mother with
The pathetically low credit score?

09:07.270 --> 09:08.290
What are you talking about?

09:08.370 --> 09:10.370
So,i had business affairs
Run her credit report.

09:10.450 --> 09:12.660
Don't hate me because 
I'm resourceful.

09:13.570 --> 09:15.960
You did what?

09:16.060 --> 09:19.240
Brooke,we have to be able to
Make a case against the woman.

09:19.340 --> 09:22.680
We are not building
A case against anyone.

09:22.760 --> 09:25.390
Do you think that I can't
See what you're doing?

09:25.470 --> 09:27.010
There is no running from this.

09:27.080 --> 09:30.070
Sam has every right
To know her...real mom.

09:30.110 --> 09:31.870
Suit yourself.

09:34.620 --> 09:36.500
Red is really your color.

09:36.580 --> 09:38.350
What do you think?

09:38.670 --> 09:41.730
Do you think we're shopping right now?

09:41.920 --> 09:43.850
Absolutely not.

09:44.790 --> 09:47.730
This is strictly r&d 
for our new line.

09:48.450 --> 09:51.900
You are so trying 
to shop with me!

09:54.360 --> 09:57.750
Uncle lucas,can I help
You fix aunt Peyton's car?

09:58.140 --> 09:59.910
Hey, sure buddy.

10:00.020 --> 10:01.550
Careful.

10:05.170 --> 10:07.210
Sure this is no problem,him
Hanging out with you?

10:07.320 --> 10:08.930
Yeah,i could use 
the company anyway.

10:10.060 --> 10:11.590
Everything okay?

10:11.670 --> 10:13.640
It's Peyton.

10:13.720 --> 10:19.330
I-i-i found her putting together a time
Capsule,or a -- a "just in case" capsule.

10:21.380 --> 10:24.410
- that's what I thought.
- I know,yeah.

10:28.020 --> 10:32.590
It's just,you know,weird that I'm approaching
What's supposed to be the most exciting moment

10:32.620 --> 10:37.100
Of my entire life with nothing
But... Complete and utter fear.

10:37.300 --> 10:39.100
You want to hear a secret?

10:39.180 --> 10:42.810
Day Jamie was born,i was...petrified.

10:42.930 --> 10:45.480
No,you know,it's
Different,though,you know?

10:45.520 --> 10:48.380
I mean,what if something
Happens to Peyton?

10:49.330 --> 10:52.030
I don't know how we got this far.

10:52.080 --> 10:55.250
Well,you got this far
'Cause it's what she wanted.

10:56.310 --> 10:58.740
You know? It's like when karen let
You play basketball with your hcm.

10:58.900 --> 11:03.450
She knew how bad you wanted it, so she
just held her breath and let you play.

11:03.530 --> 11:05.760
We all did,you know?

11:06.040 --> 11:10.480
Maybe -- maybe this is the time you
Have to hold your breath for Peyton.

11:10.630 --> 11:12.480
She wants to get married.

11:12.560 --> 11:13.850
So do you.

11:13.930 --> 11:15.580
You proposed, remember?

11:15.700 --> 11:17.150
She wants to geted married right away.

11:17.390 --> 11:20.370
It all just worries me.

11:20.650 --> 11:24.650
Well,as worried as you are,think
About how scared she is.

11:25.320 --> 11:33.240
Look,if you had one more day to spend with Peyton,would
You rather spend it arguing or just being married?

11:40.380 --> 11:41.910
You ready?

11:41.950 --> 11:43.600
For what?

11:43.790 --> 11:46.730
Peyton's baby shower.you
Didn't forget,did you?

11:47.280 --> 11:48.690
Sure she wants me there?

11:48.770 --> 11:50.740
Of course I'm sure.

11:50.860 --> 11:54.310
The invitation was addressed
to both of us, you knucklehead.

11:54.470 --> 11:56.180
Yeah.

11:57.080 --> 11:59.040
Are you okay ,Sam?

11:59.950 --> 12:02.110
Yes, I'm good.

12:02.670 --> 12:04.320
Okay.

12:05.350 --> 12:09.090
So,everything's going
Okay with,you know...

12:09.320 --> 12:11.890
My mom?

12:12.750 --> 12:15.730
- yeah.
- yeah.

12:17.690 --> 12:19.610
What do you got there?

12:25.890 --> 12:27.530
It's her house.

12:29.720 --> 12:31.560
You know, she gave me
up when she was my age.

12:32.770 --> 12:33.880
How weird is that?

12:34.890 --> 12:36.580
Yeah.

12:41.200 --> 12:44.140
She said she didn't want to,but
Her parents made her do it.

12:46.840 --> 12:51.580
Well,i can relate to having crummy
Parents who make bad decisions.

12:51.580 --> 12:54.330
Yeah.

12:54.760 --> 12:56.990
You know, it's funny.
I've always...

12:57.190 --> 13:00.060
Wanted to live in a house
With a white picket fence.

13:00.570 --> 13:02.530
Well,we can have a
Picket fence if you want.

13:02.570 --> 13:05.400
You can have  any
Kind of fence you want.

13:11.820 --> 13:15.280
I'll just wait for 
you to get dressed.

13:15.360 --> 13:17.670
You know,if it's okay,
can I just meet you there?

13:17.750 --> 13:19.480
Yeah.

13:19.720 --> 13:21.600
I'll see you at Peyton's.

13:34.900 --> 13:37.060
So,the stage is set
For the Charleston chiefs,

13:37.140 --> 13:40.200
Who can move into sole possession
Of first place with a win tonight.

13:40.280 --> 13:44.670
And with the season coming to a close and
Possible nba call-ups hanging in the balance,

13:44.790 --> 13:49.220
Coach bobby irons will be looking for explosive
Performances from his two leading scorers,

13:49.320 --> 13:52.270
Nino jones and point 
guard Nathan Scott.

13:55.210 --> 13:57.840
I can't believe anybody out
There would want your autograph.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.170
A t re than would 
want it from you.

13:59.250 --> 14:02.470
Look,just 'cause you're the starting point
Guard don't mean you can show up late.

14:05.850 --> 14:08.320
I had you going for a second.

14:09.330 --> 14:11.180
And don't worry.i covered for you,man.

14:11.690 --> 14:16.480
Well,well,you guys go on an eight-game winning
Streak,and suddenly it's a love fest in here.

14:16.560 --> 14:18.010
I wouldn't go that far.

14:18.090 --> 14:19.390
I'll tell you what, Scott --

14:19.490 --> 14:23.610
I'll waive your fine for being late if you and
Your new best friend here can do two things.

14:24.070 --> 14:25.440
And what's that?

14:25.560 --> 14:30.670
Win the game tonight... And impress the
Nba scout who's here to watch you guys play.

14:30.770 --> 14:32.360
Scout?

14:32.440 --> 14:35.220
Word is the clippers are
Looking for some backcourt help.

14:35.620 --> 14:37.970
All right,then. Yeah.

14:38.250 --> 14:40.540
- good luck,guys.
- thanks.

14:41.370 --> 14:44.350
Hey,uh, Scott, I think you
might want to sit this one out.

14:54.350 --> 14:56.280
I'm so not wearing this.

14:56.390 --> 14:58.240
Sam,it's a baby shower.

14:58.320 --> 15:01.620
You can't show up like you just
Walked out of a brazilian favela.

15:01.660 --> 15:04.530
Okay,well,this makes me
Look like kermit the frog.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.880
Okay.

15:09.490 --> 15:11.920
So, how goes it with... 
The waitress?

15:12.000 --> 15:13.840
Her name is Rebecca, thank you.

15:13.920 --> 15:17.970
And for your information,things
Are kind of going okay.

15:18.040 --> 15:22.010
Yes,well... I'm sure your
Conversations are just riveting.

15:22.050 --> 15:26.520
I mean,you have so much to talk about,what
With 16 years of pure neglect to hash over.

15:26.600 --> 15:28.720
Don't be mean.

15:28.840 --> 15:32.260
Sorry. 
It's just that she left you.

15:32.580 --> 15:35.090
So,you know...
It's not like that.

15:35.140 --> 15:37.770
I mean... I thought 
that way at first.

15:37.810 --> 15:42.480
I thought she'd be this evil person,you know,this
Bad person that gave me up,but she's not.

15:43.030 --> 15:46.680
You know,she's got her
Problems, but she's okay.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.750
I mean, in a way,she's
-- she's kind of like...

15:51.340 --> 15:52.950
Like what?

15:53.990 --> 15:55.680
Like me.

15:58.660 --> 16:01.020
Did she say she wanted you back?

16:02.000 --> 16:04.260
Doesn't matter.I'm happy here.

16:05.810 --> 16:09.770
And that's what we want for
You,Samantha -- to be happy here.

16:12.560 --> 16:14.740
Yeah, I know.it's just, I don't
want to hurt Brooke's feelings,

16:14.830 --> 16:17.730
But part of me wants 
to know her, you know?

16:18.640 --> 16:20.560
My real mom?

16:23.380 --> 16:25.260
Do you want to live with her?

16:27.310 --> 16:29.230
No.

16:29.900 --> 16:31.560
Of course you don't.

16:31.640 --> 16:33.360
That's my girl.

16:33.480 --> 16:39.250
Now let's see if we can't find a beautiful
Dress for you,worthy of the davis name.

16:49.210 --> 16:51.420
Oh,man.hey,man,don't you
Guys got somewhere else to be?

16:51.500 --> 16:53.230

Y'all asses up out of here.

16:57.830 --> 17:00.460
Hey,isn't this like the third date?

17:00.530 --> 17:01.990
You know what that means.

17:02.110 --> 17:04.440
Yeah.that's Jamie's teacher
You're talking about.

17:04.560 --> 17:06.869
This from the guy who
Dropped down granny deb.

17:07.810 --> 17:11.540
Look,it's a date,man
-- nice,classy,refined.

17:11.740 --> 17:16.530
But just in case,you two be gone
By the time I get home,a'ight?

17:19.810 --> 17:21.890
Okay,it's official.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.849
I look like a lemon-meringue pie.

17:23.930 --> 17:26.520
Shut up.you have that
Whole glow thing going.

17:26.599 --> 17:30.060
If by "glowing" you mean
"growing," then maybe.

17:32.040 --> 17:33.960
I really to lovehe dress,Brooke.

17:34.040 --> 17:35.450
It was a great gift.

17:35.530 --> 17:37.140
Thanks.

17:37.180 --> 17:39.180
Although I am just stuck in the house.

17:39.300 --> 17:43.030
Well,then you'll be stuck in the
House for a month looking fabulous.

17:43.150 --> 17:44.480
It was Sam's idea.

17:44.560 --> 17:46.640
Oh,clearly she's learning 
from the best.

17:48.450 --> 17:50.620
Where is she,anyway?I
Thought she was coming.

17:50.730 --> 17:51.990
She'll be here.

17:52.110 --> 17:55.050
You're doing an amazing
Job with her,Brooke davis.

17:58.450 --> 18:00.490
Hey,she loves you.

18:00.850 --> 18:05.510
Well,let's hope so... 'Cause I'm
Thinking of making it official.

18:05.670 --> 18:07.520
I'm thinking of adopting her.

18:07.590 --> 18:09.050
- no.
- yeah.

18:09.130 --> 18:11.330
I just got all the papers in the mail.

18:11.410 --> 18:13.410
Oh,my god,that is such good news.

18:13.530 --> 18:15.810
Come here. Sit down. 
Tell me everything.

18:15.850 --> 18:20.010
All right,um -- well,i mean,how's
It going with her birth mother?

18:20.120 --> 18:22.210
It seems like it's going okay.

18:22.280 --> 18:23.780
I'm just trying to be supportive.

18:26.260 --> 18:28.660
What if Sam likes her better than me?

18:30.110 --> 18:34.460
Okay,take it from
Someone who was adopted.

18:34.540 --> 18:38.860
I happen to know that Sam just became
The luckiest girl in the whole world.

18:40.150 --> 18:41.610
Thank you,p.sawyer.

18:42.740 --> 18:45.430
You always me everything better for me.

18:48.970 --> 18:50.970
Don't. Don't.

18:51.090 --> 18:53.910
We are not gonna ruin today crying.

18:53.990 --> 18:58.430
You're gonna get out of that dress and clean yourself
Up because we have a party to go to out there.

18:58.660 --> 19:01.020
Come on.

19:01.650 --> 19:04.120
There's an ipod in here.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.210
Awesome!

19:10.330 --> 19:13.190
This is the night you and daddy
Won the state championship.

19:13.360 --> 19:14.930

19:15.020 --> 19:16.910
In mom's tummy.

19:17.020 --> 19:17.970
That's right.

19:18.090 --> 19:20.250
So,mom and dad didn't even know me then.

19:20.320 --> 19:24.130
Well,none of us did,but we were
All really excited to meet you.

19:25.070 --> 19:26.070
Hey,look!

19:32.340 --> 19:34.620

Now,that was a really 
important night.

19:39.200 --> 19:41.720
Because you won 
the state championship?

19:41.810 --> 19:48.470
Yeah,but,um... It was also the night
I realized I wanted to marry Peyton.

19:49.380 --> 19:50.280
This is cool.

19:50.360 --> 19:52.210
What else is in here?

19:52.720 --> 19:55.290
Yeah,what is in there?

20:01.710 --> 20:03.280
Hey, Nathan, I got a question for you.

20:03.360 --> 20:05.050
Yes, we're gonna win tonight.

20:05.120 --> 20:09.210
Okay,but,uh... How are you dealing
With this long-distance thing?

20:09.600 --> 20:11.660

- yeah.me,too.

20:11.730 --> 20:14.130
And if you figure that
One out,let me know.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.420
Hey,you see that guy
Overhere talking to bobby?

20:20.460 --> 20:22.460
He's an nba scout.

20:23.130 --> 20:25.570
Good luck tonight,nate.

20:26.040 --> 20:28.240
Luck has nothing to do with it.

20:30.210 --> 20:31.830
Look at all of these presents!

20:31.910 --> 20:33.050
All right,I'm gonna open the first one.

20:33.130 --> 20:35.160
It's from mia.what did you get me?

20:36.890 --> 20:41.680
You got me... ...pictures of you.

20:41.750 --> 20:48.150
Okay,yeah,but the gift  is that you get to pick
The one that goes on the cover of our new record.

20:48.430 --> 20:49.720
Good save.

20:49.800 --> 20:51.380
All right,what do we got?What do we got?

20:51.930 --> 20:52.830

Um, sexy. Pretty!

Yay!

21:06.730 --> 21:10.530
Wow,i -- I guess this means the
Record's nearly finished,huh?

21:11.240 --> 21:13.510
Speaking of "wow"...  !

21:27.220 --> 21:28.240
Antwon..

21:28.910 --> 21:29.810
You ready?

21:29.850 --> 21:32.680
Uh,we have a slight problem.

Hey, coach skills!

21:35.110 --> 21:37.000

His mom had an emergency,and she
Couldn't pick him up from school.***

21:40.940 --> 21:43.280
So,i promised i'd watch
Him for a little while.

21:43.320 --> 21:44.740
I'm so sorry.

21:44.850 --> 21:46.820
I guess we should probably cancel?

21:48.390 --> 21:49.920
Nah.

21:50.070 --> 21:53.800
I mean, I...guess he could come.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.850
You wouldn't mind?

21:55.920 --> 21:57.060
Yeah.

21:57.140 --> 21:58.440
Why not?

21:58.480 --> 21:59.540
Great.

21:59.620 --> 22:01.580
I'll get my coat.

22:02.770 --> 22:05.040
Sweet!Where we going?

22:13.080 --> 22:15.990
Yeah,so,peewee basketball is
Just how I give back to the kids.

22:17.090 --> 22:20.200
But you would be surprised at how
Profitable the baby-proofing industry is.

22:22.460 --> 22:23.930
Yo,chuck!

22:24.020 --> 22:25.510
Sorry!

22:30.960 --> 22:33.240
Yeah,he's doing well.

22:33.410 --> 22:35.110
He don't look too bad.

22:36.440 --> 22:40.070
You know,you don't know how few guys
Would be up for a night like this.

22:40.150 --> 22:43.060
I'm so glad we didn't cancel,antwon.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.060
Really?

22:45.160 --> 22:46.540
How glad?

22:51.790 --> 22:53.720
Come on!

22:54.850 --> 22:57.460
Whose freaking kid is this?Damn it!

22:57.540 --> 22:59.510
Uh,mine!Sorry!

22:59.590 --> 23:01.200
I'll be back.

23:57.660 --> 24:04.020
That's the end of the first
Half,chiefs leading by 10,

24:04.780 --> 24:07.020
Hey,it's mama as a cheerleader.

24:07.220 --> 24:11.570
Yeah,and there's, uh, aunt
Brooke and aunt Peyton.

24:11.690 --> 24:13.630
They've been friends 
for a long time.

24:13.790 --> 24:15.710
Oh, yeah,a long time.

24:16.260 --> 24:17.550
Who's in that one?

24:17.790 --> 24:19.480
Let's see.

24:19.560 --> 24:23.520
That's uncle keith,aunt
Karen,and who's that?

24:24.500 --> 24:25.950
That's me.

24:26.070 --> 24:28.430
You were a funny-looking
Baby, uncle Lucas.

24:30.080 --> 24:31.690
Just kidding.

24:32.200 --> 24:34.770
You're kind of my
Uncle keith,aren't you?

24:35.300 --> 24:38.360
Well,i'd like to think
That's exactly who I am.

24:45.430 --> 24:47.940
Aunt Peyton's a cool angel.

24:54.590 --> 24:56.630
Is aunt Peyton gonna be okay?

24:58.460 --> 25:00.300
I don't know,bud.

25:03.650 --> 25:05.850
I think everything's 
gonna be okay.

25:14.210 --> 25:16.560
Oh, wow,what is it?

25:16.680 --> 25:21.430
It's a baby memory book,and you put photos
And journal entries and all that stuff in it.

25:21.470 --> 25:24.760
When you look at it five years from
Now,you'll never believe they were that small.

25:28.330 --> 25:31.630
You know,victoria almost
Got one of those for me.

25:36.360 --> 25:37.850
Peyton.

25:39.300 --> 25:40.250
Yeah.

25:40.790 --> 25:42.440
You okay?

25:46.670 --> 25:49.200
I love it.thank you.

25:50.700 --> 25:56.580
And... I just want you guys
To know... I love you so much.

25:57.680 --> 25:59.440
I love you,too.

25:59.800 --> 26:01.260
Okay,hold on.

26:01.380 --> 26:03.980
I'm taking a picture --
No crying for the picture.

26:04.300 --> 26:05.710
Yeah?

26:06.140 --> 26:08.030
Okay. Okay? Get in here.

26:08.390 --> 26:12.990
Ready? One,two,three.

26:14.520 --> 26:16.250
All right,let's bring it in.

26:16.290 --> 26:18.290
It's "chiefs" on
Three.one,two,three.chiefs!

26:18.400 --> 26:21.430
Let's go.let's go,dawg. Bring it home.

26:23.080 --> 26:24.670
Nate.

26:26.050 --> 26:29.260
So far,you've done a terrific
Job making nino look good.

26:29.930 --> 26:32.360
Just make sure you make
Yourself  look good,too,okay?

26:32.440 --> 26:35.660
If you get an open shot,take it.

26:37.860 --> 26:40.100
The scouts are here to watch everyone.

26:40.210 --> 26:42.060
And th includes you,coach.

26:42.650 --> 26:44.610
We're gonna win this game.

26:54.690 --> 26:56.460
I'm not angry.

26:56.580 --> 27:03.130
But I would appreciate you talking to me first
Before you start lavishing Sam with fancy clothes.

27:03.290 --> 27:04.510
I thought she looked nice.

27:04.580 --> 27:07.020
Not the point.

27:07.100 --> 27:09.010
What are you doing here?

27:09.090 --> 27:10.890
I wanted to talk to you about Sam.

27:11.070 --> 27:12.620
What about Sam?

27:12.690 --> 27:15.480
I know you care for her deeply,as do i.

27:15.560 --> 27:21.960
But I think that you should consider letting her spend
Time with her birth mother on a more permanent basis.

27:22.010 --> 27:24.050
And what makes you think that?

27:24.090 --> 27:25.500
Honey,I've been talking to her.

27:25.580 --> 27:27.430
Don't "honey" me.

27:27.500 --> 27:30.100
You talked to her about this?

27:30.140 --> 27:33.690
This is not your
Business!You had no right!

27:33.810 --> 27:37.820
I should have known that nothing good was gonna
Come of the two of you spending time together.

27:37.850 --> 27:40.040
What can I say?We get along.

27:40.080 --> 27:42.440
Unlike some people that
Shall remain nameless.

27:42.550 --> 27:43.810
You can't do this.

27:43.890 --> 27:44.870
Do what?

27:44.980 --> 27:48.000
Try to be the mother to her
That you never were to me.

27:48.120 --> 27:51.260
- last time I checked,i was
Still your -- don't say it.

27:51.380 --> 27:55.190
Anyone who ever wanted to
Be in my life -- Peyton,boys,

27:55.270 --> 27:58.080
Anyone -- you tried
To push them all away.

27:58.120 --> 28:02.050
You tried to push  everyone
Away,and nowyou want Sam to leave?

28:02.080 --> 28:03.690
I don't want Sam to leave.

28:03.740 --> 28:07.730
Yes,you do!It's why you're
Lying to my face right now!

28:07.810 --> 28:10.010
You're jealous because
She wants to be with me.

28:10.130 --> 28:13.070
Well,she's not going anywhere..

28:15.210 --> 28:17.770
...not if I hainnythg to say about it.

28:18.000 --> 28:18.790
What's that?

28:18.900 --> 28:21.530
Adoption papers.

28:21.890 --> 28:24.320
Brooke...be careful.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.090
I don't want you to get hurt.

28:26.170 --> 28:29.070
All my life,you have
Avoided being a mother to me.

28:29.150 --> 28:33.710
Do not think for one moment
That you get to start now.

28:34.450 --> 28:37.070
What's going on?

28:43.770 --> 28:45.820
I don't know.

28:46.520 --> 28:48.800
Maybe you should ask your mother.

28:52.560 --> 28:54.800
What was that about?

28:55.510 --> 29:01.670
Sam,i want to talk to you about
Something -- something...important.

29:01.860 --> 29:04.380
You're happy here,right?

29:04.580 --> 29:07.240
Yeah.what's going on?

29:07.480 --> 29:11.600
I want to adopt
You -- for real.

29:11.680 --> 29:15.060
I want to make it official and forever.

29:15.140 --> 29:17.810
I've given this a lot of thought.

29:17.860 --> 29:20.680
I want us to be a family.

29:20.720 --> 29:25.630
I know that it's your dream to have
That,and I want to give that to you now.

29:27.240 --> 29:30.100
So,what do you say?

29:30.340 --> 29:33.710
Yeah. Yeah.

29:34.300 --> 29:35.800
Okay.

29:41.290 --> 29:43.960
What?

29:44.050 --> 29:46.560
I can still see my real mom,right?

29:55.130 --> 29:57.170
Dude,save some for the second half.

29:59.250 --> 30:02.350
So,you know,you never really
Talk about your past relationship.

30:02.390 --> 30:04.080
Was it a bad break-up?

30:04.160 --> 30:05.300
Yeah,kind of.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.910
I mean,in the end,it was
Mostly a lifestyle thing.

30:07.990 --> 30:10.230
We just didn't see eye
To eye on some stuff.

30:10.290 --> 30:11.980
She was a grandma.

30:12.060 --> 30:13.750
Let's just say she was mature.

30:15.280 --> 30:16.520
Hey,look,that's cool.

30:16.640 --> 30:21.740
It's just,um -- so we're
Clear,i prefer younger guys --

30:21.820 --> 30:26.350
Younger,bald,athletic
Guys who like kids.

30:26.390 --> 30:28.690
Yeah,well,you know,that's funny,because
My last relationship didn't work

30:28.760 --> 30:33.120
Because I was too young,bald,athletic.

30:36.300 --> 30:38.260
But I do like kids.

30:49.080 --> 30:51.430
Mom says I shouldn't eat dairy.

30:53.360 --> 30:54.850
Some kids.

30:54.920 --> 30:57.520
I do like some kids.

30:59.010 --> 31:00.540
Oh,no.

31:37.100 --> 31:39.320
All right,jim-jam,come
On,buddy.we got to go.

31:39.520 --> 31:40.620
Do I have to?

31:40.740 --> 31:41.900
Yes.chop-chop.

31:41.940 --> 31:44.360
If we hurry,we can call
Your dad before your bedtime.

31:45.420 --> 31:47.620
This isu hat yoguys
Have been working on?

31:49.800 --> 31:50.740
Don't tell.

31:50.890 --> 31:52.550
It's a surprise for aunt Peyton.

31:52.640 --> 31:54.050
Sorry.

31:54.830 --> 31:57.140
So,uh,how was the shower?Is she okay?

31:57.220 --> 31:59.910

Really enjoyed herself.

31:59.990 --> 32:01.430

Good.glad to hear it.

32:06.210 --> 32:08.390

32:09.810 --> 32:11.760
Thanks,uncle lucas.that was fun.

32:11.880 --> 32:13.420
Yeah,it was.

32:13.960 --> 32:16.240
Your whole life's in that box.

32:16.360 --> 32:18.480
I wish I had one.

32:20.600 --> 32:22.640

And you are sweet.

32:40.890 --> 32:45.370
Look,i know it wasn't the night you
Planned,but you were really great with chuck.

32:45.680 --> 32:47.330
Yeah.

32:47.430 --> 32:50.570
Well,maybe next time it
Could just be the two of us.

32:50.770 --> 32:51.670
I'd like that.

32:51.750 --> 32:53.220
- yeah?

32:54.720 --> 32:56.800
Naughty,naughty.

32:57.920 --> 32:59.860

32:59.900 --> 33:02.010

- good night.

33:13.820 --> 33:17.090
She's cool.you should ask
Her out sometime,coach.

33:17.920 --> 33:20.270
Oh,god.

33:37.010 --> 33:38.970
Can I talk to you?

33:47.760 --> 33:52.080
Listen,i didn't mean
To ambush you...before.

33:52.230 --> 33:54.270
That wasn't right.

33:54.340 --> 33:56.460
It's okay.

33:58.700 --> 34:00.670
I don't think it is.

34:02.160 --> 34:07.770
Sam,I've actually been thinking about this,and i
Think you should go spend some time with your real mom.

34:09.840 --> 34:12.270
You want to,don't you?

34:13.330 --> 34:15.679
Please don't hate me.

34:16.780 --> 34:19.100
Samantha,i could never hate you.

34:20.120 --> 34:22.310
I love you very much.

34:22.389 --> 34:24.670
But you stayed fore.

34:25.489 --> 34:28.080
You... You let go of julian for me.

34:28.320 --> 34:31.659
Honey,i was doing what was best for you.

34:31.850 --> 34:36.600
And that was true then,and...
I think it's true now.

34:37.920 --> 34:39.730
You should go.

34:40.280 --> 34:42.860
You know you can always come back here.

34:44.230 --> 34:46.699
How come you're so good to me?

34:47.679 --> 34:52.080
Because I love you,no matter what.

34:59.610 --> 35:00.710
Can I keep the dress?

35:02.120 --> 35:03.760
Of course.

35:03.910 --> 35:10.310
It's just,uh... Victoria says i
Look like a davis in that dress.

35:12.900 --> 35:15.370
Honey,you'll always be a davis to me.

35:15.490 --> 35:18.000
You'll always be my first mom.

35:18.120 --> 35:20.550
Okay.

35:33.200 --> 35:34.970
How about that Nathan Scott?

35:35.040 --> 35:36.890
Played a pretty great game tonight.

35:37.020 --> 35:39.410
Honestly,I've never really
Seen him as a point guard.

35:39.490 --> 35:41.650
But I got to say,i was impressed.

35:41.730 --> 35:43.630
Kid's got a bright future.

35:43.710 --> 35:45.750
With the clippers?

35:55.010 --> 35:57.250
Hey, what happened?

35:57.330 --> 35:59.340
- I thought you
Were -- don't say it.

35:59.540 --> 36:02.000
You know that annoying
Kid from my peewee team?

36:02.080 --> 36:03.500
Yeah, the hoser kid?

36:03.570 --> 36:05.110
Yeah.

36:05.190 --> 36:06.680
Let's just say I got chucked.

36:06.760 --> 36:08.290
Damn.

36:12.530 --> 36:17.310
Hey, I just,uh,realized
You forgot something.

36:18.490 --> 36:19.830
This.

36:28.580 --> 36:30.300
I'm gonna miss you.

36:31.360 --> 36:33.130
I'll miss you,too.

36:33.170 --> 36:36.480
You know,you always have
A home here, no matter what.

36:38.670 --> 36:40.360
I love you, Sam.

36:40.480 --> 36:42.440
I love you,too.

36:46.290 --> 36:47.900
Samantha.

36:57.390 --> 36:58.940
- bye.
- bye.

37:12.160 --> 37:13.930
Okay.bye.

37:28.980 --> 37:31.180
Are you crying?

37:31.610 --> 37:35.350
No.it's this horrible mascara.

37:35.420 --> 37:38.130
It's just -- remind me
To sue the manufacturer.

37:38.240 --> 37:41.490
It's our mascara,victoria.

37:44.120 --> 37:46.160
What do we do now?

37:46.320 --> 37:49.190
We have our work to focus on.

37:51.450 --> 37:52.590
Of course.

38:01.390 --> 38:03.080
Hey,coach.

38:03.320 --> 38:05.510
Have you heard anything from thecout?

38:05.590 --> 38:07.870
Uh,no.no,not yet.

38:07.910 --> 38:11.250
But listen,you guys did
All you could out there.

38:11.290 --> 38:13.960
And now we just wait
For the phone to ring.

38:34.930 --> 38:40.550
'Cause all you talk about

38:42.540 --> 38:48.890
Is to see yourself break out

38:51.840 --> 38:57.530
I've seen you this way before

39:00.460 --> 39:04.660
Life's strange but true

39:08.700 --> 39:12.580
What are we waiting for?

39:14.190 --> 39:19.440
It's been long time,nothing new

39:24.260 --> 39:27.870
Something survived here

39:32.070 --> 39:38.030
You've been working overtime

39:38.310 --> 39:44.240
How's it feel to lie?

39:45.210 --> 39:47.220
It's going to be okay,honey.

39:49.020 --> 39:51.060
I'm fine.

39:56.320 --> 39:59.770
We have our work to focus on now.

40:03.580 --> 40:08.170
Life's strange but true

40:11.890 --> 40:15.820
What are we waiting for?

40:17.620 --> 40:22.650
It's been a long time,nothing new

40:24.760 --> 40:31.470
For a while   we were living

40:32.930 --> 40:39.280
It's the pace   that'll kill you

40:39.480 --> 40:43.640
Kill you

40:43.640 --> 40:46.060
There's still one thing missing.

40:47.500 --> 40:48.950
What's that?

40:53.510 --> 40:55.630
Our wedding photo.

40:56.930 --> 40:58.890
Really?

40:59.010 --> 41:01.780
- we can get married right away?
- sure.

41:02.290 --> 41:05.470
Only if the doctor says it's okay.

41:06.220 --> 41:13.790
But it's not because of the baby or
Our situation or... Well,any damn thing.

41:15.590 --> 41:19.120
I want you to be my
Wife... 'Cause I love you.

41:22.310 --> 41:24.630
I love you with all my heart.

41:27.080 --> 41:28.580
I love you, too.

41:28.770 --> 41:31.830
I'm here
