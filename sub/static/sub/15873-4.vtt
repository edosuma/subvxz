00:02.145 --> 00:03.612
A few months ago, I
discovered I had a twin sister.

00:03.646 --> 00:05.513
And then she she asked
me to take her place,

00:05.580 --> 00:07.855
keep the secret, find our real mother

00:07.890 --> 00:09.970
and try to stay alive.

00:10.005 --> 00:11.606
Put yourself in my shoes.

00:11.641 --> 00:15.374
How long could you keep up the lying game?

00:15.408 --> 00:16.729
- I'm not interested.
- Oh, is that right?

00:20.442 --> 00:22.469
You said it was fine, so I slept with him.

00:22.537 --> 00:24.366
It was a mistake, Sutton.

00:24.400 --> 00:26.395
Ted, about the therapy session on Monday,

00:26.429 --> 00:27.627
I'll be there.

00:27.661 --> 00:29.462
I'm so happy for you.

00:29.496 --> 00:30.560
What's going on here?

00:30.594 --> 00:31.692
I was just thanking her

00:31.726 --> 00:34.289
- for tutoring me.
- You know what?

00:34.323 --> 00:35.454
It doesn't matter.

00:35.488 --> 00:36.554
Care to make things interesting?

00:36.588 --> 00:38.287
You want to switch back?

00:38.321 --> 00:40.623
Whoever loses has to stay in the cabin.

00:40.657 --> 00:42.357
That phone I found exonerated him.

00:42.392 --> 00:44.458
I can't beat him. The only
mistake I made was taking

00:44.492 --> 00:45.591
your bastard ass in.

00:45.625 --> 00:47.323
Hey, hey!

00:47.357 --> 00:48.421
There is nothing left for me here anymore.

00:48.455 --> 00:49.552
What about me?

00:49.586 --> 00:51.350
Tough break, but a deal's a deal.

00:51.385 --> 00:52.717
I left some clean towels
for you at the cabin.

00:52.752 --> 00:55.317
I've gotten the feeling that he might

00:55.351 --> 00:57.386
blame me for his arrest.

00:57.420 --> 00:59.387
Hey, baby, I'm home.

01:14.790 --> 01:17.423
Good morning, sunshine.

01:17.458 --> 01:19.758
Uh, what are you doing?

01:19.793 --> 01:20.859
Just watching you sleep.

01:20.893 --> 01:22.394
I missed that.

01:22.428 --> 01:23.595
Well, isn't that romantic?

01:23.629 --> 01:25.829
I've been in prison for a while.

01:25.864 --> 01:27.731
I can't believe I'm actually here with you.

01:29.834 --> 01:31.735
Well...

01:35.504 --> 01:36.770
was it worth the wait?

01:36.805 --> 01:39.506
You tell me.

01:39.540 --> 01:41.708
So, your first day as a free man.

01:41.742 --> 01:42.776
What are your plans?

01:44.778 --> 01:47.546
I was thinking maybe we could take that

01:47.580 --> 01:50.648
honeymoon we've been putting off.

01:50.682 --> 01:54.618
Oh, well, that sounds great, but...

01:54.652 --> 01:56.586
where are we gonna go on such short notice?

01:56.620 --> 01:58.787
As it turns out, I got a
little spot I know about.

01:58.822 --> 02:00.589
- A little bed and breakfast?
- Hmm.

02:00.624 --> 02:01.757
A five-star resort and spa?

02:01.791 --> 02:02.790
Ah, now, it wouldn't be a surprise

02:02.825 --> 02:04.425
if I told you, would it?

02:04.459 --> 02:07.460
Oh, well, come on, just a little hint.

02:07.494 --> 02:10.828
Please tell me.

02:10.863 --> 02:13.631
Let's just say that this weekend

02:13.666 --> 02:17.434
my bride finally gets
everything she deserves.

02:20.671 --> 02:21.604
Finally.

02:36.583 --> 02:37.849
This is Thayer.

02:37.884 --> 02:39.550
You know what to do.

02:39.585 --> 02:42.453
Hey, it's me again.

02:42.487 --> 02:45.788
answer, so I'm trying you here.
I tried your cell and you didn't

02:45.823 --> 02:47.456
that you're okay. I just want to know

02:47.491 --> 02:49.391
I hate the way we left things.

02:49.425 --> 02:50.625
Please call me.

02:55.596 --> 02:57.496
Thayer?

02:57.531 --> 02:59.398
Nope, it's me.

02:59.432 --> 03:01.466
I wanted to see how your
night at the cabin was.

03:01.500 --> 03:02.700
You're checking on me?

03:02.734 --> 03:04.635
Well, of course, you're my sister.

03:04.670 --> 03:07.805
Plus, I know how lonely it can get there.

03:07.839 --> 03:10.340
Yeah, I can't argue with that.

03:10.375 --> 03:12.442
But it's just for a few days, right?

03:12.476 --> 03:14.476
We're switching back
after tennis regionals.

03:14.511 --> 03:15.477
That was the deal.

03:15.511 --> 03:17.778
Anyway, I'm calling

03:17.812 --> 03:21.780
because I wanted to make
sure you're not mad at me

03:21.814 --> 03:24.507
for what I told you

03:24.541 --> 03:27.632
the other day about, you know.

03:27.667 --> 03:29.365
About you sleeping with Ethan?

03:29.400 --> 03:30.599
I told you, it's fine.

03:30.633 --> 03:31.699
Really?

03:31.734 --> 03:33.633
Yes, sleep with whomever you want.

03:33.668 --> 03:36.467
Just promise me you won't do anything

03:36.501 --> 03:38.334
to rock the boat with Ted and Kristin.

03:38.368 --> 03:39.534
If you haven't noticed,

03:39.568 --> 03:40.534
they're getting along better now.

03:40.568 --> 03:41.701
I get it, Emma.

03:41.735 --> 03:43.369
You have my word.

03:43.403 --> 03:47.661
And, in fact, I think
you'll find that I am going

03:47.695 --> 03:52.413
to be a sweeter, nicer
version of myself than you.

03:52.447 --> 03:54.405
Do you have a sec?

03:54.440 --> 03:55.770
You have nothing to
worry about. I have to go.

03:55.804 --> 03:57.561
What's up?

03:57.595 --> 04:00.685
I wanted to talk to you about
what happened last night.

04:00.720 --> 04:02.513
What happened last night?

04:02.547 --> 04:04.605
When I saw Jordan kissing Mads outside?

04:04.640 --> 04:07.330
Oh, right, yeah, that...

04:07.365 --> 04:08.395
that was rough.

04:08.429 --> 04:09.493
I thought things were going so well

04:09.528 --> 04:11.260
between me and Jordan,

04:11.294 --> 04:13.632
and then Mads just totally
goes behind my back...

04:13.667 --> 04:15.264
Okay, look, Laurel.

04:15.299 --> 04:16.531
What you need to remember

04:16.565 --> 04:20.562
is that Jordan Lyle is a worldly,

04:20.596 --> 04:22.494
older,

04:22.528 --> 04:24.525
dangerously sexy guy

04:24.560 --> 04:27.255
who, let's face it,

04:27.290 --> 04:30.386
is way out of your league.

04:32.485 --> 04:35.415
If I remember correctly, uh, the other day,

04:35.449 --> 04:37.413
you said he'd be lucky to have me.

04:37.448 --> 04:40.344
And clearly you blew it,

04:40.379 --> 04:43.642
so I think you should move on.

04:43.677 --> 04:47.304
I mean, go for some lower
hanging fruit like a sophomore.

04:47.339 --> 04:50.237
Or one of those guys in the clubs

04:50.271 --> 04:51.392
in the back of the yearbook.

04:54.533 --> 04:56.496
I... I don't get it.

04:56.531 --> 04:58.460
I know, I know.

04:58.494 --> 05:01.355
Love... it's very confusing.

05:01.389 --> 05:04.215
I'm hungry for breakfast, though.

05:04.249 --> 05:06.244
I'm thinking tofu scramble?

05:11.236 --> 05:16.236
- synced and corrected by chamallow -

05:31.805 --> 05:33.566
Hi, Dad.

05:33.600 --> 05:34.697
What are you doing here?

05:34.732 --> 05:35.696
Hi, kiddo.

05:35.730 --> 05:36.728
Your father has some news.

05:36.763 --> 05:38.457
What is it?

05:38.491 --> 05:40.486
Well, remember all that
pro bono work I was doing

05:40.520 --> 05:41.584
at the burn clinic last summer?

05:41.618 --> 05:43.448
Turns out

05:43.482 --> 05:44.580
I was just named

05:44.614 --> 05:46.744
Phoenix Surgical Humanitarian of the Year.

05:46.779 --> 05:48.475
That's awesome.

05:48.509 --> 05:50.606
Is there, like, some kind
of ceremony or something?

05:50.640 --> 05:51.637
Yeah, the banquet's tomorrow.

05:51.671 --> 05:53.333
Originally I was gonna go myself,

05:53.368 --> 05:54.648
but then, since they're giving me

05:54.666 --> 05:56.496
this award, I was kind of hoping...

05:56.531 --> 05:58.294
Well, of course, we'll be there.

05:58.328 --> 05:59.626
There's one more thing.

05:59.661 --> 06:03.489
They usually ask the
recipient's significant other

06:03.524 --> 06:05.654
to say a few words before the presentation.

06:05.689 --> 06:08.418
So I guess the committee
doesn't know about our situation?

06:08.452 --> 06:09.484
Actually, I was going to mention it,

06:09.518 --> 06:10.516
but then I thought things were going

06:10.551 --> 06:12.381
pretty well between us, so...

06:15.679 --> 06:18.208
I know it's a lot to spring on you.

06:18.242 --> 06:20.306
Maybe we can discuss it
during family therapy tomorrow.

06:20.341 --> 06:21.405
Maybe.

06:21.440 --> 06:23.336
Great. I'll see you then.

06:23.371 --> 06:25.401
Bye.

06:25.435 --> 06:26.500
Bye, Dad.

06:26.535 --> 06:27.533
Bye, hon.

06:27.567 --> 06:28.599
Bye.

06:31.430 --> 06:32.528
Well, that was awkward.

06:33.595 --> 06:35.425
We are going, right, Mom?

06:35.460 --> 06:37.257
Of course, of course.

06:37.291 --> 06:39.255
But, I mean, for me to
be giving a speech is...

06:39.289 --> 06:41.219
Mom, please, it would mean so much to him.

06:41.254 --> 06:42.418
And you guys have been doing better.

06:42.453 --> 06:44.216
Well, yes, in the sense

06:44.251 --> 06:47.246
that we can be in the
same room without fighting.

06:47.281 --> 06:49.378
But for me to stand up
in front of an audience

06:49.412 --> 06:51.309
and pretend that we're a happy couple...

06:51.344 --> 06:52.475
No, why don't Laurel and I do it?

06:52.510 --> 06:54.574
Really?

06:54.608 --> 06:56.472
Mm-hmm.

06:56.506 --> 06:58.270
I mean, sure, yeah, we can do it.

06:58.304 --> 06:59.385
Sweetie, it's short notice.

06:59.404 --> 07:01.167
Do you have time to prepare a speech?

07:02.200 --> 07:03.565
For a bunch of nerdy doctors? Yeah.

07:05.524 --> 07:08.353
Plus, I already know what I'm going to say.

07:11.575 --> 07:13.538
Mads, I wasn't expecting you.

07:13.573 --> 07:15.437
Uh, because I'm not here to see you.

07:15.471 --> 07:17.603
Hey, is this about last night?

07:17.638 --> 07:18.669
'Cause until Laurel
had her little meltdown,

07:18.703 --> 07:19.702
you and I were getting

07:19.736 --> 07:20.734
pretty hot and...

07:20.768 --> 07:22.767
I'm not here to discuss that.

07:22.802 --> 07:23.836
Okay, why are you here?

07:23.871 --> 07:26.642
Maddie?

07:26.676 --> 07:27.675
Hi, honey.

07:27.710 --> 07:28.875
Hi.

07:28.909 --> 07:29.875
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

07:29.909 --> 07:31.473
Me, too.

07:31.507 --> 07:32.472
- You good?
- Yes.

07:32.506 --> 07:33.671
Mr. Rybak,

07:33.706 --> 07:34.771
we didn't get a chance to meet last night.

07:34.805 --> 07:36.504
- I'm Jordan Lyle.
- Jordan.

07:36.538 --> 07:37.703
- Rebecca's stepson.
- Yes, sir.

07:37.738 --> 07:39.435
- You can call me Alec.
- All right.

07:39.470 --> 07:41.801
- I see you two have already met?
- Barely.

07:41.835 --> 07:43.795
We've bumped into each
other a couple times, yeah.

07:43.800 --> 07:47.743
Hmm, well, glad you're acquainted.

07:47.777 --> 07:49.680
Maddie, since I've moved
in here with Rebecca,

07:49.714 --> 07:51.684
I was kind of hoping you might
think about doing the same.

07:51.718 --> 07:52.886
Really?

07:52.921 --> 07:54.859
That's an interesting idea, sir.

07:54.893 --> 07:56.833
We'll see.

07:56.867 --> 07:57.936
It's good to see that everybody's

07:57.970 --> 07:59.741
getting to know each other.

07:59.776 --> 08:01.880
Honey, did you tell them
about our honeymoon plans?

08:01.914 --> 08:03.686
Honeymoon?

08:03.720 --> 08:05.524
Um, yeah...

08:06.494 --> 08:07.461
Sutton?

08:07.496 --> 08:09.699
What are you doing here?

08:09.733 --> 08:11.568
Well, the door was open, so...

08:11.602 --> 08:12.669
So you just walked in?

08:12.703 --> 08:14.670
Well, my godfather

08:14.704 --> 08:16.471
is back and

08:16.505 --> 08:18.572
I was just so excited to see him.

08:18.607 --> 08:22.608
Well, you're kind of
interrupting a family moment.

08:22.642 --> 08:24.576
So let me show you out.

08:27.746 --> 08:29.546
Okay, I'm sorry.

08:29.580 --> 08:30.780
I didn't realize I was walking

08:30.815 --> 08:33.783
into the Bizarro family reunion back there.

08:33.817 --> 08:35.717
Why are you freaking out?

08:35.751 --> 08:36.751
I'm not freaking out.

08:36.785 --> 08:38.818
You were being careless.

08:38.854 --> 08:40.821
Fine, I screwed up, but I'm
just really excited to tell you

08:40.855 --> 08:42.722
- what happened this morning.
- What?

08:42.756 --> 08:44.591
My dad's getting this award...

08:44.625 --> 08:45.859
- What award?
- I don't know.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.695
I wasn't really listening.

08:47.729 --> 08:50.796
Maybe for giving homeless people
free boob jobs or something?

08:50.830 --> 08:51.897
Anyway,

08:51.932 --> 08:54.600
he asked Kristin to
introduce him at the ceremony.

08:54.635 --> 08:55.768
She said no.

08:55.802 --> 08:56.903
Guess who offered to speak instead.

08:56.937 --> 08:58.739
- Excellent.
- Mm-hmm, and get this:

08:58.773 --> 09:00.642
- we're going to family therapy.
- Mm-hmm.

09:00.676 --> 09:03.647
And don't worry, I already
know what I'm going to say.

09:03.681 --> 09:06.720
Okay, even so, I want
you to run it by me first.

09:06.754 --> 09:08.657
Our plan is moving to the next phase,

09:08.691 --> 09:10.726
and I don't want to
leave anything to chance.

09:10.760 --> 09:11.794
Okay?

09:11.828 --> 09:13.728
Call me later.

09:14.763 --> 09:15.730
Okay.

09:25.609 --> 09:28.715
Look, if you want to take a break, we...

09:28.749 --> 09:29.850
No, let's just keep going.

09:29.884 --> 09:31.620
We have a ton of chemistry to do left.

09:31.655 --> 09:33.491
Okay.

09:36.830 --> 09:38.967
Emma, I just want you to
know that I, I appreciate

09:39.001 --> 09:40.837
you still tutoring me.

09:40.871 --> 09:42.839
'Cause I know you're probably going

09:42.874 --> 09:45.976
through a lot with Thayer leaving.

09:46.011 --> 09:48.613
Ethan, let's not do this.

09:48.647 --> 09:50.682
What?

09:50.717 --> 09:51.984
I'm... I'm just trying to be a friend here.

09:52.019 --> 09:54.789
You're not my friend.

09:54.856 --> 09:56.991
And I may be helping you
study here, but I don't want

09:57.025 --> 09:59.593
to discuss Thayer any
more than I want to talk

09:59.628 --> 10:01.189
about what happened with you and Sutton.

10:02.797 --> 10:06.934
Of course.

10:06.968 --> 10:10.671
She told you that we slept
together after Jordan's party.

10:10.705 --> 10:12.940
It's not my business.

10:12.974 --> 10:14.708
Then, why are you acting like it is?

10:17.646 --> 10:21.682
Because I used to think
you were better than that.

10:30.759 --> 10:31.759
What are they doing here?

10:34.062 --> 10:35.662
Oh, crap.

10:39.115 --> 10:43.084
Alec, I know you wanted to
surprise me, but this place?

10:43.118 --> 10:45.119
What are we, hillbillies?

10:45.153 --> 10:47.655
Hurry, grab everything. They
can't know we were here. All right.

10:50.059 --> 10:51.959
- Is this yours?
- Doesn't matter, just take it.

10:54.162 --> 10:55.762
Damn it.

10:55.796 --> 10:57.130
Hang on, uh, here, give me a towel, quick.

10:57.164 --> 10:58.131
Uh...

10:58.165 --> 11:00.735
Here, take this.

11:00.769 --> 11:01.936
Oh, hurry, hurry, hurry.

11:01.970 --> 11:03.705
Your keys.

11:03.739 --> 11:04.940
Got it. Got it.

11:17.085 --> 11:18.686
What?

11:19.855 --> 11:21.088
I'm sorry.

11:21.123 --> 11:23.057
I'm a little rusty.

11:23.091 --> 11:24.825
- Oh.
- Come here.

11:24.860 --> 11:27.061
I had no idea you were so old-fashioned.

11:27.095 --> 11:29.628
Oh, well, there's more
surprises where that came from.

11:29.662 --> 11:30.828
That sounds good.

11:30.862 --> 11:33.629
Look, flat screen.

11:33.664 --> 11:34.897
Are they on their honeymoon?

11:34.932 --> 11:36.132
I guess.

11:36.167 --> 11:38.769
Oh, my God, what if
they start getting naked?

11:39.771 --> 11:40.804
Ted bought this place

11:40.839 --> 11:42.640
when they were still in diapers.

11:42.674 --> 11:44.642
Now you couldn't pay 'em to come up here.

11:45.711 --> 11:48.046
Oh, well, I'm sure

11:48.080 --> 11:50.715
I will come to love it.

11:50.750 --> 11:53.752
After all, you brought me
up here for some reason.

11:53.787 --> 11:57.091
I'm sure I'll figure out what that is.

11:58.928 --> 12:01.797
Why don't I give you

12:01.831 --> 12:03.933
- the grand tour?
- Oh.

12:04.868 --> 12:06.735
She saw us.

12:06.769 --> 12:07.969
- No, she didn't.
- Yes, she did.

12:08.004 --> 12:09.003
She looked right at me.

12:09.038 --> 12:10.638
Oh. 

12:10.673 --> 12:12.841
Wait, w... wait, slow down, cowboy.

12:12.875 --> 12:15.911
I'm not done with you in this room.

12:18.681 --> 12:19.748
We have to go.

12:19.783 --> 12:21.650
Let's go. There's a window.

12:21.685 --> 12:23.786
Laurel, come on, I want to apologize

12:23.820 --> 12:25.754
for last night, all right? I...

12:25.789 --> 12:27.056
I don't want it to be weird between us.

12:27.090 --> 12:28.859
Hmm, think it's late for that, don't you?

12:28.893 --> 12:30.661
Well, it doesn't have to be.

12:30.695 --> 12:32.629
When you invited me to
the club the other night,

12:32.663 --> 12:34.698
I didn't know that was a
date. All right, that's my bad.

12:34.732 --> 12:37.968
Look, you're very pretty, all right?

12:40.038 --> 12:42.072
I'm pretty?

12:42.106 --> 12:44.041
Yeah.

12:44.075 --> 12:46.711
Okay, look, Jordan, any misguided feelings

12:46.745 --> 12:49.781
I might have briefly had
for you are definitely over,

12:49.815 --> 12:52.684
so you can save your
patronizing compliments.

12:52.718 --> 12:53.819
That's fair enough.

12:53.853 --> 12:54.953
Anything else?

12:57.123 --> 12:58.957
All right, let me tell you what.

12:58.991 --> 13:00.025
Let's go grab some breakfast,

13:00.059 --> 13:02.060
and you can yell at me all you want.

13:02.095 --> 13:03.996
What do you say?

13:04.030 --> 13:05.731
I say,

13:05.766 --> 13:08.668
have fun kissing your stepsister, creep.

13:31.726 --> 13:33.660
Well, I didn't see that one coming.

13:33.694 --> 13:35.862
Yeah, Alec honeymooning at the cabin.

13:35.897 --> 13:38.766
I kind of figured him for a
Turks and Caicos kind of guy.

13:38.800 --> 13:39.934
You gonna be okay here?

13:39.968 --> 13:41.869
Yeah.

13:41.903 --> 13:43.104
This is the hotel that Sutton stayed

13:43.138 --> 13:45.640
when her car went into the lake.

13:45.674 --> 13:47.942
You want me to come inside with you?

13:47.977 --> 13:49.977
No.

13:50.012 --> 13:51.979
I'm fine. Thanks.

13:52.013 --> 13:55.749
So this means tutoring is out, I guess?

13:55.783 --> 13:58.986
No.

13:59.020 --> 14:01.890
Believe it or not, I don't want
to see you go back to juvie.

14:01.925 --> 14:03.025
So...

14:03.059 --> 14:05.994
just meet me back here later.

14:06.029 --> 14:09.799
We'll finish our session.

14:09.833 --> 14:11.968
Hey.

14:12.002 --> 14:13.069
Emma?

14:13.103 --> 14:15.639
Thanks.

14:24.949 --> 14:27.050
Hi, I need a room, please.

14:27.084 --> 14:29.877
It's you.

14:29.911 --> 14:32.735
I'm sorry?

14:32.769 --> 14:33.900
You owe me money.

14:35.732 --> 14:38.895
I do owe you money

14:38.930 --> 14:40.860
from the last time I was here.

14:40.894 --> 14:42.691
What was the bill again?

14:42.725 --> 14:44.689
You know, this isn't about the bill.

14:44.723 --> 14:45.888
I did you a favor.

14:45.922 --> 14:47.852
When that guy came in asking questions,

14:47.887 --> 14:50.781
you paid me to lie and say
you were in that room alone.

14:50.815 --> 14:53.636
Right.

14:53.670 --> 14:54.935
Alone, well, I...

14:54.970 --> 14:56.867
I was with that woman.

14:56.901 --> 14:58.664
That woman. You mean women.

14:58.698 --> 15:00.795
- What?
- Wow.

15:00.829 --> 15:03.791
You really did take a knock
on the head that night.

15:03.826 --> 15:06.955
Girly, there were two
women with you in that room.

15:06.990 --> 15:08.887
- Two women?
- Yeah, two.

15:08.921 --> 15:10.485
So, where's my 80 bucks?

15:20.448 --> 15:23.283
I got to say, this crappy motel room

15:23.318 --> 15:26.320
isn't exactly the ideal
place for studying Faulkner.

15:26.354 --> 15:27.655
Yeah.

15:27.689 --> 15:29.490
Maybe if we talk louder,

15:29.524 --> 15:32.428
the hookers next door will learn something.

15:33.700 --> 15:36.213
Hey, maybe that's them now.

15:41.654 --> 15:43.288
Sutton, what are you doing here?

15:43.322 --> 15:45.457
What does it look like I'm doing here?

15:45.492 --> 15:47.293
Ethan gave me a little hint

15:47.327 --> 15:48.394
about your cram session.

15:48.428 --> 15:50.696
So I thought I'd hit the books.

15:50.730 --> 15:52.531
Really?

15:52.565 --> 15:54.533
You're here to study?

15:56.636 --> 15:59.204
Well, yeah, thanks to you,

15:59.239 --> 16:01.540
Sutton Mercer has a hefty
GPA to maintain, so...

16:01.574 --> 16:05.444
and studying is all that's
going on here, right?

16:05.478 --> 16:06.578
What do you think?

16:07.580 --> 16:10.214
Anyway, you know,

16:10.249 --> 16:12.485
I figured you'd be pretty
busy working on your speech.

16:12.520 --> 16:13.520
What speech?

16:13.554 --> 16:15.222
Oh, it's nothing.

16:15.256 --> 16:16.556
Just some stupid awards thing for my dad.

16:19.594 --> 16:21.262
Being here brings back

16:21.296 --> 16:22.630
so many memories, which is surprising,

16:22.664 --> 16:26.367
considering I had a head
wound last time I was here.

16:26.401 --> 16:27.534
Yeah, funny you should say that,

16:27.569 --> 16:29.503
because when I was checking in,

16:29.537 --> 16:30.604
the desk clerk said something

16:30.638 --> 16:32.305
kind of weird to me.

16:32.420 --> 16:33.653
Well, he's weird.

16:33.688 --> 16:35.689
What did he say?

16:35.723 --> 16:38.558
He said that when you were here,

16:38.593 --> 16:41.628
Annie wasn't the only person with you.

16:41.662 --> 16:43.463
Someone else was here.

16:43.497 --> 16:45.465
Did he now?

16:47.702 --> 16:50.571
Well, he was so busy
hitting on me that night

16:50.605 --> 16:53.740
that he couldn't have possibly
noticed who I was with.

16:56.344 --> 16:58.311
Who did he think he saw?

16:59.413 --> 17:01.548
He didn't say.

17:01.582 --> 17:03.684
But anyway, you're right.

17:03.718 --> 17:05.285
He...

17:05.319 --> 17:07.252
creeped me out, too.

17:09.690 --> 17:11.657
This is nice.

17:11.693 --> 17:14.327
Cloth napkins,

17:14.361 --> 17:16.496
candlelight.

17:16.530 --> 17:19.366
Le poulet en croûte.

17:19.400 --> 17:20.467
It's from Celine,

17:20.501 --> 17:22.469
your favorite spot.

17:22.502 --> 17:25.405
Well, you really did think of everything.

17:26.440 --> 17:27.674
It's a very special wine.

17:27.708 --> 17:31.544
I've been saving it for
a very special occasion.

17:31.578 --> 17:35.381
I think tonight might just be that night.

17:42.656 --> 17:45.425
Let's celebrate like tonight

17:45.459 --> 17:47.594
is our last night on Earth.

17:53.634 --> 17:54.734
You know, one of the things

17:54.769 --> 17:56.570
we never talked about is what you did

17:56.604 --> 17:59.306
the whole time I was gone.
I mean, that must have been

17:59.341 --> 18:02.310
tough for you, having
your new husband locked up.

18:02.344 --> 18:03.578
It was.

18:03.612 --> 18:05.413
They were the hardest days of my life.

18:05.447 --> 18:07.282
I'll bet.

18:07.316 --> 18:09.417
Did you ever wonder if I was
ever getting out of there?

18:09.452 --> 18:10.719
Now, why would I?

18:10.753 --> 18:13.254
You're an innocent man.

18:13.289 --> 18:15.690
I have faith in the system.

18:15.724 --> 18:19.260
Although there was this one moment.

18:20.429 --> 18:21.596
Oh, it's nothing.

18:21.630 --> 18:24.265
We were both under a lot of stress.

18:24.300 --> 18:27.669
There was this one time that
I went to see you in jail,

18:27.703 --> 18:30.472
and... I...

18:30.506 --> 18:34.542
could have thought that you...

18:34.577 --> 18:36.377
thought that I was somehow...

18:37.680 --> 18:40.448
behind framing you for Derek's murder.

18:40.482 --> 18:42.483
That's crazy talk.

18:42.518 --> 18:45.320
And we both know you were my rock,

18:45.354 --> 18:46.755
you know, through the whole thing.

18:46.789 --> 18:50.525
- Of course.
- Plus, if I thought you were framing me

18:50.560 --> 18:52.594
about anything,

18:52.629 --> 18:55.664
I don't think we'd be sitting here
drinking an $800 bottle of wine.

18:55.699 --> 18:57.700
I'd be outside, burying you in the woods.

19:00.704 --> 19:03.306
Not if I buried you first.

19:05.743 --> 19:07.477
Touché.

19:18.589 --> 19:20.290
Hey, girlie, hold up.

19:20.324 --> 19:22.459
Can I help you?

19:22.493 --> 19:24.294
Actually, I was thinking I could help you.

19:24.329 --> 19:25.596
You know how earlier

19:25.630 --> 19:27.264
you couldn't remember how there were

19:27.299 --> 19:28.699
two ladies with you
that night you were here?

19:28.733 --> 19:31.702
Yes.

19:31.737 --> 19:34.438
My mind was blank, but yes.

19:34.472 --> 19:35.706
So, to jog your memory,

19:35.740 --> 19:38.476
I, uh, put together a couple sketches

19:38.510 --> 19:39.591
of the women you were with.

19:43.349 --> 19:44.682
So what do you think?

19:46.585 --> 19:49.753
I think you're a very
talented artist, Carl.

20:04.436 --> 20:06.605
Correct me if I'm wrong,

20:06.639 --> 20:09.675
but wasn't our deal that,
if I won our tennis match,

20:09.709 --> 20:12.310
you stay hidden until after regionals?

20:12.345 --> 20:15.414
Actually, the deal was
that I stay in the cabin,

20:15.448 --> 20:18.483
which is now full of
middle-aged honeymooners.

20:18.518 --> 20:20.452
Here.

20:20.486 --> 20:21.687
What is this?

20:21.721 --> 20:23.522
It's a speech.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.423
I was thinking about Ted's awards banquet,

20:25.458 --> 20:27.559
and I just thought I'd help.

20:27.593 --> 20:29.328
That's really sweet of you, Emma,

20:29.362 --> 20:30.729
but I have it covered. Thank you.

20:30.764 --> 20:32.465
Are you sure?

20:32.499 --> 20:35.435
Because this is huge, Sutton.

20:35.469 --> 20:37.704
I mean, the family is going to be together,

20:37.739 --> 20:39.639
and Ted and Kristin are
in such a precarious place.

20:39.673 --> 20:40.640
I said no.

20:42.844 --> 20:44.478
Sutton?

20:47.649 --> 20:49.450
Laurel, wait!

20:49.484 --> 20:50.618
What's going on?

20:50.652 --> 20:52.620
Look who finally decided

20:52.654 --> 20:54.555
to do her hair today.

20:54.589 --> 20:56.457
What are you doing? What do you want?

20:56.491 --> 20:58.759
Okay, I can't believe I'm
actually about to say this,

20:58.794 --> 21:01.295
but I wanted to thank you

21:01.329 --> 21:03.597
for the advice you gave me about Jordan.

21:03.631 --> 21:04.765
Seriously?

21:04.799 --> 21:06.734
Yeah. I mean, I don't buy

21:06.768 --> 21:08.703
the whole out-of-my-league thing,

21:08.737 --> 21:12.306
but you were right about
him being wrong for me.

21:12.340 --> 21:13.441
Well, you're welcome.

21:13.475 --> 21:15.777
I'll show you to...

21:15.811 --> 21:17.679
Actually, no. Uh, so,

21:17.713 --> 21:19.647
after I told off Jordan,

21:19.682 --> 21:21.649
which was incredibly fun, by the way,

21:21.684 --> 21:25.353
I got to wondering.

21:25.387 --> 21:27.755
What's wrong with us?

21:28.690 --> 21:30.725
Why do the Mercer sisters

21:30.760 --> 21:32.627
keep picking the wrong guys?

21:32.661 --> 21:34.796
Justin, Jordan, Ethan?

21:34.830 --> 21:37.632
Is this you giving me love advice?

21:37.667 --> 21:40.469
I'm just asking.

21:40.503 --> 21:43.472
Why are you wasting your
time tutoring Ethan, the guy

21:43.506 --> 21:45.541
who broke your heart, when
you have someone like Thayer?

21:45.575 --> 21:47.476
Oh, yeah, Thayer.

21:47.510 --> 21:50.679
Of course, he's just so sweet and kind

21:50.714 --> 21:53.516
and loyal as a puppy dog.

21:53.550 --> 21:55.518
You say that like it's a bad thing.

21:57.521 --> 21:59.722
He cares about you.

21:59.757 --> 22:02.291
And for a while there,

22:02.326 --> 22:04.360
I thought you cared about him, too.

22:16.738 --> 22:17.705
Damn it!

22:22.377 --> 22:25.346
Alec? Alec?!

22:25.380 --> 22:27.748
What happened to the power?

22:27.782 --> 22:31.685
Alec? Are you there?

22:52.742 --> 22:54.777
Alec, where are you?

22:57.614 --> 22:59.415
Alec?

22:59.449 --> 23:00.749
Is this a joke?

23:37.707 --> 23:39.642
That was quite a spill you took.

23:41.845 --> 23:44.713
Get away.

23:44.747 --> 23:45.947
You did that on purpose.

23:45.982 --> 23:48.749
- What?
- I know what you're doing.

23:48.784 --> 23:50.851
This whole honeymoon,

23:50.886 --> 23:53.120
the little looks, the cryptic comments.

23:53.155 --> 23:56.024
You're, you're screwing with my head!

23:56.058 --> 23:57.859
I know those lights

23:57.893 --> 23:59.761
didn't go off by themselves.

23:59.796 --> 24:01.663
Yes, they did. That's
exactly what happened, honey.

24:01.698 --> 24:02.798
I went outside to check the breakers,

24:02.833 --> 24:03.999
and the box was locked.

24:04.034 --> 24:06.035
I had to come back in and
get the key. I changed it.

24:06.069 --> 24:07.904
You're lying.

24:07.938 --> 24:11.007
Why don't you just cut this
whole loving husband act

24:11.041 --> 24:13.843
and tell me why you brought me up here?

24:13.877 --> 24:15.611
Do you really think I framed you?

24:15.646 --> 24:18.881
Sweetheart, we've been through this.

24:18.916 --> 24:21.851
If I still thought that, then
where are the divorce papers?

24:21.885 --> 24:24.787
What are we doing up here on our honeymoon?

24:24.821 --> 24:27.623
Why would I move into your house and ask

24:27.657 --> 24:30.859
my daughter to do the exact same thing?

24:30.893 --> 24:35.798
How could I possibly make love to you?

24:35.833 --> 24:38.868
Sweetheart, if I thought you betrayed me

24:38.903 --> 24:40.770
and yet did all those things,

24:40.805 --> 24:43.874
what kind of man would that make me?

24:45.677 --> 24:46.810
Come here.

25:18.073 --> 25:20.943
Why do I get the feeling
you're not just running late?

25:20.977 --> 25:23.612
I'm sorry.

25:23.646 --> 25:24.980
I would have called earlier,

25:25.014 --> 25:26.748
but something really important came up.

25:26.782 --> 25:27.982
Sound like you're on the road.

25:28.918 --> 25:33.688
I'm on a bus... to L.A.

25:35.724 --> 25:37.658
Of course you are.

25:37.693 --> 25:40.061
I care about him, Ethan.

25:40.095 --> 25:42.063
And we both know you're
better off being tutored

25:42.098 --> 25:43.732
by somebody else anyway.

25:43.766 --> 25:44.866
You're right.

25:44.900 --> 25:47.102
Tell Thayer hey.

25:48.670 --> 25:51.734
I'm... really sorry.

25:52.767 --> 25:54.995
So am I.

25:59.766 --> 26:01.800
Thought Sutton was coming
over to help you study.

26:01.835 --> 26:02.868
It's a change of plans.

26:02.902 --> 26:04.636
You pissed her off, didn't you?

26:04.671 --> 26:08.673
Yes, I did. Anything else?

26:08.708 --> 26:11.976
Ethan, the way I see it,
you can either sit here

26:12.010 --> 26:13.844
and feel sorry for yourself,

26:13.879 --> 26:15.913
or you can go find Sutton
and beg for forgiveness.

26:15.947 --> 26:17.748
Because I'm telling you,

26:17.782 --> 26:19.649
her help is the only thing
that is standing between you

26:19.684 --> 26:21.045
and a trip back to juvie right now.

26:23.887 --> 26:24.987
It's a good speech, Dan.

26:25.021 --> 26:26.955
Just a little too late.

26:32.961 --> 26:34.729
Look, nobody wants

26:34.764 --> 26:36.764
these two back together more than I do,

26:36.799 --> 26:40.768
but, I mean, one day,
they're fighting in public,

26:40.802 --> 26:43.737
and the next day we're in counseling trying

26:43.772 --> 26:44.939
to work things out.

26:44.973 --> 26:46.742
Meanwhile, everyone's miserable..

26:46.777 --> 26:48.078
Honey, it's a process.

26:48.112 --> 26:50.747
Your mother and I are both
working very hard to try...

26:50.781 --> 26:55.085
When does it end? I'm sorry, I know
this is going to sound terrible,

26:55.119 --> 26:57.988
but sometimes I look around me and see how

26:58.022 --> 26:59.989
this is affecting everybody,

27:00.024 --> 27:03.593
and I just think maybe the
two of you are better off...

27:03.628 --> 27:05.929
What are you saying, Sutton?

27:05.964 --> 27:08.031
You want Mom and Dad to
get a divorce just because

27:08.066 --> 27:11.670
it's too hard for you to
watch them work things out?

27:11.704 --> 27:13.872
I'm saying that they
need to make a decision

27:13.906 --> 27:15.807
and stick with it.

27:15.842 --> 27:17.976
Do you have any idea how
selfish you sound right now?

27:18.010 --> 27:20.745
Oh, really, Laurel? And what
if Mom actually wants a divorce?

27:20.780 --> 27:23.915
Okay, I think maybe everyone
needs to take a little time-out.

27:23.950 --> 27:24.949
Who asked you?

27:24.984 --> 27:26.751
- Laurel!
- That's okay.

27:26.786 --> 27:30.622
Actually, I think...

27:30.656 --> 27:32.590
I think I understand what Sutton is saying.

27:32.625 --> 27:35.826
And in her own way, she's, she's
just trying to look out for me.

27:35.861 --> 27:36.994
Why do you think that?

27:37.029 --> 27:39.697
Well, Sutton's always been strong-willed,

27:39.732 --> 27:43.802
and while it hasn't made
it easy being her mom,

27:43.836 --> 27:46.872
I've always just admired that strength.

27:46.906 --> 27:49.942
You know, when she was a baby,

27:49.977 --> 27:52.877
the night Sutton came
home to live with us was

27:52.911 --> 27:57.776
the happiest of my life,
but I was terrified.

27:57.810 --> 28:01.011
I mean, the adoption...
it happened so quickly.

28:01.046 --> 28:04.014
I felt so unprepared.

28:04.048 --> 28:08.548
What if I did something wrong?

28:08.583 --> 28:12.948
What if you cried, and
I couldn't comfort you?

28:12.982 --> 28:16.973
I stayed with you in the nursery
all night just holding you.

28:17.008 --> 28:19.803
And you know what?

28:19.837 --> 28:21.835
You didn't cry at all.

28:21.869 --> 28:25.766
You were so calm, just looking around,

28:25.800 --> 28:29.632
taking everything in.

28:29.666 --> 28:33.764
I know this sounds crazy,
but it was almost...

28:33.798 --> 28:36.863
it's almost like you
were being strong for me.

28:41.767 --> 28:43.767
It's great that you
intercepted that drawing of me,

28:43.802 --> 28:47.637
but it is just a reminder that
we are running out of time.

28:47.672 --> 28:49.873
I think it's time we step things up.

28:49.907 --> 28:51.674
Well, what does that mean exactly?

28:51.708 --> 28:53.576
Because we're doing everything that we can.

28:53.610 --> 28:54.710
Well, are we?

28:54.744 --> 28:56.578
I mean, I hate to say it, Sutton,

28:56.612 --> 28:58.713
but it sounds like family
therapy was kind of a bust.

28:58.748 --> 29:01.815
Okay, look, I know it didn't
go as well as I had planned,

29:01.850 --> 29:03.783
but I'm working on this
speech for the banquet,

29:03.818 --> 29:05.818
and trust me...

29:05.853 --> 29:08.521
I am covering everything:

29:08.555 --> 29:11.923
the lies, the infidelity, the fights

29:11.958 --> 29:13.658
between Ted and Kristin.

29:13.692 --> 29:15.856
Well, that's good,

29:15.890 --> 29:18.858
um, but I think we need to take
things a little bit further.

29:18.892 --> 29:19.925
Well, how much further?

29:19.960 --> 29:22.628
I mean, when you take that stage

29:22.662 --> 29:25.730
with Kristin sitting in the front row,

29:25.765 --> 29:27.966
that's when you tell everybody the truth;

29:28.001 --> 29:31.503
that Dr. Ted Mercer is
your biological father.

29:31.537 --> 29:32.871
- You're kidding.
- Not at all.

29:32.905 --> 29:34.639
But are you sure?

29:34.674 --> 29:38.543
I mean, look, I know that that's huge,

29:38.577 --> 29:40.945
But don't you think it's a little much?

29:40.979 --> 29:43.915
Plus, people will know that
you're my mother if I say that.

29:43.949 --> 29:45.784
I know...

29:45.818 --> 29:47.919
And no one will be more shocked than I.

29:47.954 --> 29:52.765
After all, who knew that
you were the daughter

29:52.800 --> 29:55.707
I was forced to give up 17 years ago?

29:57.577 --> 29:58.877
Well, what about Alec?

29:58.912 --> 30:01.546
What's he gonna say when
all of this comes out?

30:01.580 --> 30:02.947
Don't worry about that.

30:02.982 --> 30:04.782
You just work on the speech,

30:04.850 --> 30:07.018
and when the time comes,

30:07.053 --> 30:10.555
I'll take care of Alec Rybak.

30:16.763 --> 30:18.563
What's with the suitcase?

30:20.633 --> 30:24.804
I mean, I know we've been kind
of been avoiding each other,

30:24.838 --> 30:26.639
but you're moving out?

30:26.673 --> 30:29.843
You're right, I have been avoiding you,

30:29.877 --> 30:32.579
but that's not why I'm leaving.

30:32.613 --> 30:35.648
Um...

30:35.682 --> 30:37.650
my dad is staying at Rebecca's now

30:37.684 --> 30:39.985
and wants me to move in with him tomorrow.

30:40.020 --> 30:43.956
Rebecca's... where Jordan lives.

30:43.991 --> 30:45.991
Unfortunately.

30:46.026 --> 30:48.027
You know, if you liked him,
you could have just told me.

30:48.061 --> 30:50.930
Well, the thing is, I don't.

30:50.964 --> 30:53.933
And now I'm just really
sorry that this whole

30:53.967 --> 30:55.735
stupid incident came between us.

30:55.769 --> 30:58.938
Yeah, me, too.

31:00.974 --> 31:02.775
We're friends?

31:02.809 --> 31:04.710
Yeah, friends.

31:04.745 --> 31:07.747
Well, then, as your friend...

31:07.782 --> 31:10.817
and I know you say you're not interested...

31:10.851 --> 31:12.652
but I'm totally over Jordan,

31:12.686 --> 31:15.655
so if you're thinking of
kissing him again, go for it.

31:15.689 --> 31:17.757
Thank you, but there
are a million reasons why

31:17.792 --> 31:19.593
that's never gonna happen,

31:19.627 --> 31:21.862
including the fact that
we are practically related.

31:21.896 --> 31:22.977
And you're sure about that?

31:22.996 --> 31:25.798
Positive.

31:34.607 --> 31:36.742
Hi! Thayer, thank God.

31:36.776 --> 31:38.577
Why didn't you call me back?

31:38.611 --> 31:40.731
Did you get my message about
the desk clerk telling me

31:40.747 --> 31:41.947
that there were two women at the motel?

31:41.981 --> 31:43.015
Okay, slow down.

31:43.049 --> 31:45.684
What? I thought you'd be happy to see me.

31:45.719 --> 31:48.020
You asked me to come here, and here I am.

31:48.054 --> 31:51.958
Yeah, I am, but I asked you to
come with me... two days ago.

31:51.993 --> 31:55.898
I didn't realize there
was an expiration date.

31:55.933 --> 31:58.728
Oh, hey! Who's this?

31:58.763 --> 32:01.661
Uh...

32:01.696 --> 32:03.696
uh...

32:03.731 --> 32:04.965
No one.

32:07.871 --> 32:09.573
Emma...

32:09.608 --> 32:10.943
Emma, could you stop for a second?

32:10.977 --> 32:12.915
That girl you saw is just...

32:12.949 --> 32:14.655
What? Payback? Look, maybe

32:14.689 --> 32:16.762
I should have said yes
and come with you out here.

32:16.797 --> 32:18.635
But you need to get past the stupid idea

32:18.669 --> 32:19.804
that I have feelings for Ethan!

32:19.839 --> 32:20.920
Okay, listen, I really don't

32:20.941 --> 32:22.878
want to talk about this right now, okay?

32:22.912 --> 32:24.683
Right now or ever?

32:24.717 --> 32:26.588
Listen, stop.

32:26.622 --> 32:29.058
Can I at least give you
a ride to the bus station?

32:29.092 --> 32:30.829
Don't bother.

32:30.864 --> 32:33.034
You don't want to keep your blonde waiting.

32:46.620 --> 32:49.556
- Hey.
- Hi.

32:49.590 --> 32:50.857
Big day, huh?

32:50.891 --> 32:52.993
Yeah.

32:53.027 --> 32:57.731
It could end up being a lot
bigger than people realize.

32:57.765 --> 32:59.467
What are you talking about?

32:59.501 --> 33:00.668
Nothing.

33:00.702 --> 33:03.738
Just nervous for my speech.

33:03.772 --> 33:06.474
Still I'm not quite sure
what I'm going to say.

33:06.508 --> 33:10.545
Yeah, well, before she left, Emma seemed

33:10.579 --> 33:12.581
kind of worried about that, too.

33:12.615 --> 33:14.583
Big surprise.

33:14.617 --> 33:16.485
She always expects the worst of me.

33:16.519 --> 33:20.755
Well, maybe this is your
chance to prove her wrong.

33:22.992 --> 33:24.826
Oh, hey, sweetheart.

33:24.860 --> 33:26.528
Oh, you look beautiful.

33:26.562 --> 33:27.696
Thank you.

33:27.730 --> 33:28.897
You, too.

33:28.931 --> 33:31.600
You feeling nervous about your speech?

33:31.635 --> 33:33.870
Little more than I thought I would.

33:33.904 --> 33:35.505
It's gonna be fine.

33:35.539 --> 33:37.807
Um...

33:37.842 --> 33:40.710
hey, Mom, that story you told yesterday

33:40.745 --> 33:44.681
at therapy about my first night at home?

33:44.715 --> 33:46.783
How come you never told me that before?

33:48.686 --> 33:50.787
Well, honey, I'm... I'm sure I did.

33:50.821 --> 33:54.791
Maybe it's just the
first time you listened.

34:16.547 --> 34:17.612
Oh, my.

34:18.815 --> 34:19.782
Hey there.

34:21.684 --> 34:22.751
Moving in already?

34:22.784 --> 34:24.652
No, not until tomorrow.

34:24.687 --> 34:25.888
- I'm just dropping off a few things.
- Why don't you

34:25.922 --> 34:27.589
drop your bags and hang out for a minute?

34:27.623 --> 34:28.724
No, thank you.

34:28.757 --> 34:31.560
Well, why don't you let me help you?

34:31.594 --> 34:32.828
Unpack later.

34:34.964 --> 34:36.498
What the hell was that?

34:36.532 --> 34:38.801
Stop smiling.

34:38.835 --> 34:40.902
'Cause whatever you think is
about to happen really isn't.

34:40.937 --> 34:41.904
Oh, is that right?

34:41.938 --> 34:43.706
Yeah.

34:43.739 --> 34:45.507
What's really going on here, Mads?

34:45.542 --> 34:46.909
And don't say dropping
the sweaters off and stuff,

34:46.944 --> 34:47.976
'cause you could do that tomorrow.

34:51.549 --> 34:53.783
I promised myself I wouldn't.

34:53.817 --> 34:56.652
Well, then, I guess you lied.

35:05.698 --> 35:07.466
The biggest gift my father

35:07.500 --> 35:09.668
has given me is the example he's set

35:09.702 --> 35:13.705
by donating his time and
talents to others in need.

35:13.740 --> 35:15.574
That's why we're here today,

35:15.608 --> 35:18.477
and it's why I'm proud to call him my dad.

35:31.956 --> 35:35.725
So...

35:35.760 --> 35:38.662
I had written a speech

35:38.696 --> 35:40.897
about my dad...

35:40.931 --> 35:43.734
um, bunch of clichés

35:43.768 --> 35:46.569
about how great of a doctor he is,

35:46.604 --> 35:48.570
how great of a humanitarian,
and don't get me wrong,

35:48.604 --> 35:50.738
that's very true.

35:51.974 --> 35:57.479
But today I want to
talk about another truth.

35:59.482 --> 36:03.652
Something you don't know about Ted Mercer.

36:03.686 --> 36:05.654
And that...

36:14.931 --> 36:18.568
and that...

36:18.602 --> 36:21.604
is...

36:21.639 --> 36:23.706
that his greatest accomplishment
and the smartest thing

36:23.741 --> 36:27.844
he has ever done was to
marry my mom Kristin Mercer.

36:27.878 --> 36:32.481
Because she is the one
who makes this family work.

36:32.516 --> 36:34.917
And together, she and my dad

36:34.951 --> 36:37.787
have built a life that any child would

36:37.821 --> 36:41.757
be so lucky to be a part of.

36:41.791 --> 36:43.859
Even an ungrateful daughter

36:43.893 --> 36:46.795
who hasn't always paid attention

36:46.830 --> 36:48.564
enough to notice.

36:55.905 --> 36:58.773
Honey, that was...

36:58.808 --> 37:01.609
Ladies and gentlemen,

37:01.643 --> 37:04.445
Phoenix Surgical Humanitarian
of the Year, Dr. Ted Mercer.

37:04.479 --> 37:05.678
Hey, Sutton.

37:05.713 --> 37:06.781
Ethan, not right now, please.

37:06.815 --> 37:07.881
W... what? That was great.

37:09.718 --> 37:10.851
No, it wasn't.

37:10.886 --> 37:12.920
You don't understand. It wasn't great.

37:12.954 --> 37:15.756
Are you kidding me? You were real up there.

37:15.790 --> 37:19.493
Okay, so many times you've
talked about how you've changed,

37:19.528 --> 37:21.462
but that was from the heart.

37:21.497 --> 37:23.598
All right, that was the...

37:23.632 --> 37:25.712
that was the Sutton Mercer
from the ranch that night.

37:27.637 --> 37:29.504
Well, wonderful.

37:29.538 --> 37:31.540
I gave a sappy speech about my parents

37:31.574 --> 37:32.707
in front of a bunch of doctors.

37:32.742 --> 37:34.476
What is that going to get me?

37:36.746 --> 37:37.679
This.

37:53.146 --> 37:55.214
Home sweet home.

37:58.119 --> 37:59.319
So quiet.

37:59.353 --> 38:01.422
Jordan.

38:01.456 --> 38:04.025
I think I hear him out by the pool.

38:04.059 --> 38:05.326
All right, well, will you say hi for me?

38:05.360 --> 38:07.395
- I'm gonna go upstairs and take a bath.
- Sure.

38:07.429 --> 38:10.331
Bye, baby.

38:19.107 --> 38:20.074
Alec.

38:20.108 --> 38:22.108
Hey.

38:22.143 --> 38:23.311
How was the, uh, how was the honeymoon?

38:23.345 --> 38:26.047
It was memorable.

38:26.081 --> 38:28.082
Good.

38:28.117 --> 38:29.284
You're doing laps at this hour, huh?

38:29.318 --> 38:30.418
Yeah.

38:32.221 --> 38:35.057
You haven't seen Mads, have you?

38:35.091 --> 38:37.226
She was going to stop by
here and drop some stuff off.

38:37.260 --> 38:38.360
No, I haven't seen her.

38:38.394 --> 38:40.129
She might have been here earlier

38:40.163 --> 38:42.030
while I was gone, though. Don't know.

38:42.065 --> 38:43.232
Good night.

39:00.184 --> 39:02.418
I thought you said you weren't
going to do that anymore.

39:02.453 --> 39:06.289
Well, I thought so, too.

39:06.323 --> 39:08.357
And now we're living under the same roof.

39:08.392 --> 39:10.192
So, things went pretty
bad with Thayer, huh?

39:10.227 --> 39:11.994
Yeah.

39:12.028 --> 39:14.063
Should have known it
wouldn't work out, though,

39:14.097 --> 39:16.198
when he didn't return
any of my phone calls.

39:16.233 --> 39:18.000
Oh, well, when are you coming back?

39:18.035 --> 39:19.135
Soon.

39:19.169 --> 39:21.070
The last bus out last night was canceled,

39:21.104 --> 39:23.345
so I had to sleep here at the
station, and it was just...

39:23.373 --> 39:25.140
Shower's free if you want it.

39:25.175 --> 39:26.407
Who are you talking to?

39:26.441 --> 39:29.378
- Sutton.
- Oh, great.

39:29.412 --> 39:33.215
Hey, I didn't realize you'd
left already, but I just wanted

39:33.249 --> 39:35.050
to say good luck at regionals

39:35.084 --> 39:37.219
and reiterate how completely genius

39:37.254 --> 39:38.487
that speech was last night.

39:38.521 --> 39:40.456
Thank you.

39:40.490 --> 39:43.225
Love you.

39:43.260 --> 39:46.396
Anyways, um,

39:46.430 --> 39:49.298
I guess I will just check
in on you later, okay?

39:49.333 --> 39:50.433
Wait, Mads, no, don't, tell me what...

39:59.109 --> 40:01.043
Sutton, I thought you were on your...

40:01.078 --> 40:02.111
Running late, so do you mind moving?

40:02.146 --> 40:03.413
I can get a yogurt.

40:03.447 --> 40:05.381
Thank you.

40:08.419 --> 40:10.387
Saguaro Bus Lines 237

40:10.421 --> 40:15.192
to Riverside, San Bernardino,
and Phoenix, now boarding.

40:19.231 --> 40:20.197
Thank you.

40:24.336 --> 40:26.304
Let's see...

40:29.174 --> 40:30.508
You missed this.

40:32.345 --> 40:34.079
What are you doing here?

40:34.113 --> 40:35.514
Oh, I checked the bus schedule,

40:35.548 --> 40:38.317
figured I still might be able to catch you.

40:41.488 --> 40:45.458
Listen, Emma, that girl you saw
at my apartment is just a friend.

40:45.492 --> 40:47.527
We surf together, but that's it.

40:47.561 --> 40:50.229
Well, why didn't you just tell me that?

40:50.264 --> 40:53.433
Because I can be hardheaded sometimes.

40:53.468 --> 40:55.235
But I also don't want
to be one of those guys

40:55.270 --> 40:57.104
That lets pride get in the
way of what he really wants.

40:57.138 --> 40:59.273
And what do you really want?

40:59.307 --> 41:01.408
One question:

41:01.443 --> 41:03.110
those messages you left about Sutton

41:03.144 --> 41:05.112
and the second woman at the motel...

41:05.146 --> 41:07.047
did you come here because you want my help

41:07.082 --> 41:08.115
or because you want me?

41:10.552 --> 41:13.321
Both.

41:13.355 --> 41:15.223
Thayer, when you left, I... I...

41:38.249 --> 41:39.570
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

41:41.352 --> 41:43.453
What the hell happened at the banquet?

41:43.487 --> 41:45.155
I don't know, I...

41:45.189 --> 41:48.458
You had a golden
opportunity and you folded.

41:48.492 --> 41:50.226
Are you going soft on me?

41:50.261 --> 41:53.095
No...

41:53.130 --> 41:55.131
Look, I just realized that
my feelings for Kristin

41:55.165 --> 41:57.132
are a little bit more
complicated than I had thought.

41:57.167 --> 42:01.069
And I know she's not my mother, but I...

42:01.104 --> 42:02.504
But maybe you prefer her to be.

42:02.538 --> 42:04.506
No.

42:04.540 --> 42:08.077
I was just up on that stage,
and... and to humiliate her

42:08.111 --> 42:09.245
in front of everybody...

42:09.279 --> 42:11.514
I'm just not as okay with it as you are.

42:11.548 --> 42:14.117
Well, I'm very sorry to
hear that, sweetheart,

42:14.151 --> 42:15.318
because now you've
forced me to do something

42:15.352 --> 42:17.053
I was hoping I could avoid.

42:17.087 --> 42:18.354
What is this?

42:18.388 --> 42:21.257
It's a journal, handwritten
by Kristin Mercer.

42:21.291 --> 42:24.260
Read it and you'll see,
when you were a baby, that

42:24.294 --> 42:27.330
this "wonderful mother" that
you spoke so glowingly about

42:27.364 --> 42:30.266
wanted to give you away.
