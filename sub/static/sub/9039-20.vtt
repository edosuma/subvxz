WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:05.100
- [singing out of key]
ME AND

00:05.100 --> 00:06.500
MRS.

00:06.500 --> 00:08.567
MRS. BARONE

00:08.567 --> 00:12.967
MRS. BARONE,
MRS. BARONE, MRS. BARONE

00:12.967 --> 00:19.000
DON'T GOT A THING GOING ON

00:19.000 --> 00:21.400
[sniffs]
WHOA.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.100
- [gasps]
- AH! AAH!

00:29.100 --> 00:31.200
- RAY!

00:33.800 --> 00:35.833
I'M IN HERE!

00:35.833 --> 00:37.100
- I FORGOT DEODORANT.

00:37.100 --> 00:38.100
- GET OUT!

00:38.100 --> 00:39.733
- WHAT IS THAT?
- OUT!

00:39.733 --> 00:41.400
- YOU HAVE A MUSTACHE.

00:41.400 --> 00:43.000
- OUT!

00:46.467 --> 00:49.333
- SORRY!

00:49.333 --> 00:51.200
SIR.

00:57.533 --> 01:00.400
- RAY, WHY DID YOU
WALK IN ON ME?

01:00.400 --> 01:03.800
- YOU HAVE A MUSTACHE.
- WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

01:03.800 --> 01:05.233
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOCK?

01:05.233 --> 01:07.967
- YOU HAVE A MUSTACHE.

01:07.967 --> 01:09.400
- YOU JUST GONNA BARGE IN
ON ME?

01:09.400 --> 01:10.600
- I FORGOT DEODORANT.

01:10.600 --> 01:12.800
YOU HAVE A MUSTACHE.

01:12.800 --> 01:15.600
- IT'S NOT A MUSTACHE.
IT'S A LITTLE PEACH FUZZ.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.367
- WELL, HOW LONG--
HOW LONG HAVE YOU--

01:17.367 --> 01:19.267
- WHAT? WHAT?
HOW LONG HAVE I WHAT, RAY?

01:19.267 --> 01:23.167
- BEEN SPORTING THAT?

01:23.167 --> 01:24.567
- FOR AS LONG
AS YOU'VE KNOWN ME,

01:24.567 --> 01:26.233
AND FOR AS LONG
AS YOU'VE KNOWN ME,

01:26.233 --> 01:28.667
I'VE BLEACHED IT,
AND IT'S NOT A MUSTACHE!

01:28.667 --> 01:29.800
- LET ME LOOK AT IT.

01:29.800 --> 01:31.500
- WOULD YOU STOP?
DON'T EXAMINE ME!

01:31.500 --> 01:33.367
YOU SHOULD BE
APOLOGIZING TO ME!

01:33.367 --> 01:37.800
- I'M SORRY.
NATURE CAN BE CRUEL.

01:37.800 --> 01:39.667
- YOU JUST DON'T WALK IN
ON SOMEBODY.

01:39.667 --> 01:41.700
YOU WEREN'T EVEN SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE ANYMORE.

01:41.700 --> 01:43.300
- HEY, YOU WALK IN ON ME
ALL THE TIME.

01:43.300 --> 01:44.667
- 'CAUSE YOU
DON'T CLOSE THE DOOR.

01:44.667 --> 01:48.033
- THAT'S 'CAUSE
I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE.

01:48.033 --> 01:50.633
- TRUST ME.
YOU DO.

01:52.733 --> 01:54.433
YOU KNOW, THE BATHROOM
WAS THE LAST PLACE

01:54.433 --> 01:57.533
I HAD ANY PRIVACY,
AND NOW THAT'S GONE.

01:57.533 --> 02:01.133
- I COULD BUILD YOU
A TREE HOUSE.

02:01.133 --> 02:04.100
- I NEVER GET TO BE ALONE.
NEVER!

02:04.100 --> 02:05.633
YOU'RE WITH ME,
OR THE KIDS ARE WITH ME,

02:05.633 --> 02:07.733
AND WHEN THE KIDS ARE GONE,
I'M STILL NOT ALONE,

02:07.733 --> 02:10.367
'CAUSE YOUR PARENTS
WALK IN HERE ALL THE TIME.

02:10.367 --> 02:12.033
I MEAN, YOU GET TO LEAVE,
YOU KNOW?

02:12.033 --> 02:14.433
YOU GO TO WORK, AND YOU'RE ALONE
IN YOUR CAR AND THE OFFICE,

02:14.433 --> 02:16.367
AND I JUST NEED SOME TIME
TO MY--

02:16.367 --> 02:19.267
WHAT ARE YOU SMILING ABOUT?

02:19.267 --> 02:20.567
- I'M JUST PICTURING YOU

02:20.567 --> 02:22.833
TYING A YOUNG GIRL
TO THE RAILROAD TRACKS.

02:22.833 --> 02:23.900
[maniacal laughter]

02:23.900 --> 02:25.333
- I DON'T HAVE A MUSTACHE!

02:25.333 --> 02:28.033
- ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT!
ALL RIGHT! COME ON.

02:28.033 --> 02:29.133
YOU WANT
SOME TIME ALONE?

02:29.133 --> 02:30.700
THAT'LL STOP THE YELLING?

02:30.700 --> 02:31.767
- YES, RAY.

02:31.767 --> 02:33.567
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
LET'S DO IT.

02:33.567 --> 02:35.733
WHAT DO WE DO?

02:35.733 --> 02:38.367
- YOU COULD GO, TAKE THE KIDS,
AND DO SOMETHING.

02:38.367 --> 02:41.233
- THE KIDS?
THAT'S MORE YELLING.

02:41.233 --> 02:43.367
- YES, RAY,
THAT'S HOW I GET TO BE ALONE.

02:43.367 --> 02:44.967
YOU COULD TAKE THEM
TO THE PARK

02:44.967 --> 02:46.967
FOR AN AFTERNOON
ONCE IN A WHILE.

02:46.967 --> 02:49.333
- A WHOLE AFTERNOON?

02:49.333 --> 02:51.300
- ALL RIGHT, RAY, TAKE THEM OVER
TO YOUR MOTHER'S,

02:51.300 --> 02:54.967
AND SHE CAN BABYSIT
ALL OF YOU.

02:54.967 --> 02:56.900
- ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL DO IT.

02:56.900 --> 02:58.400
WE'LL DO IT TOMORROW, OKAY?

02:58.400 --> 03:00.967
BUT YOU GOT TO PROMISE
TO KEEP UP THE MAINTENANCE

03:00.967 --> 03:03.833
ON THE OLD SOUP STRAINER.

03:03.833 --> 03:05.367
COME ON.

03:05.367 --> 03:07.667
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S ALL I GOT.

03:07.667 --> 03:09.933
EXCEPT GROUCHO,
SOMETHING ABOUT GROUCHO.

03:09.933 --> 03:11.867
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

03:11.867 --> 03:13.367
LOOK AT THE BRIGHT SIDE.

03:13.367 --> 03:15.667
THE MUSTACHE WILL DISTRACT ME
FROM THE CELLULITE.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.033
- HEY, MA.
- HI, DEAR.

03:27.033 --> 03:28.633
- COME ON.
- HELLO, DARLING.

03:28.633 --> 03:30.833
- CAN THE KIDS WATCH A VIDEO
OVER HERE?

03:30.833 --> 03:31.833
- OH, CERTAINLY.
WHY?

03:31.833 --> 03:33.200
YOUR VCR IS NOT WORKING?

03:33.200 --> 03:34.833
- NO, NO, IT'S WORKING.

03:34.833 --> 03:37.233
I JUST THOUGHT WE COULD COME
OVER HERE AND, YOU KNOW, HANG.

03:37.233 --> 03:38.367
- OH, HOW WONDERFUL.
GO ON IN.

03:38.367 --> 03:40.200
COM ON.
GO WATCH YOUR VIDEOS.

03:40.200 --> 03:42.067
[chuckles]

03:42.067 --> 03:43.667
FRANK, THE KIDS ARE HERE.

03:43.667 --> 03:45.600
BUCKLE YOUR PANTS.

03:48.867 --> 03:50.567
WHERE'S DEBRA?

03:50.567 --> 03:51.700
- NOWHERE.
SHE'S HOME.

03:51.700 --> 03:52.867
- OH?

03:52.867 --> 03:55.100
- YEAH, SHE JUST WANTED
SOME TIME TO HERSELF.

03:55.100 --> 03:56.300
- TIME TO HERSELF?

03:56.300 --> 03:59.267
- YEAH.
HEY, YOU GOT PUDDING SNACKS?

03:59.267 --> 04:01.467
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,
TIME TO HERSELF?

04:01.467 --> 04:03.633
- SHE JUST WANTS TIME TO,
I DON'T KNOW,

04:03.633 --> 04:05.833
BE ALONE, RELAX.

04:05.833 --> 04:08.133
- BE ALONE WITHOUT YOU?

04:08.133 --> 04:10.067
- WITHOUT EVERYBODY.

04:10.067 --> 04:12.567
- I DON'T LIKE THIS.

04:12.567 --> 04:15.233
- WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG
WITH THOSE KIDS?

04:15.233 --> 04:18.433
THEY'RE ALWAYS STICKY.

04:18.433 --> 04:20.967
- DEBRA WANTS TIME
AWAY FROM RAYMOND.

04:20.967 --> 04:23.600
- IT'S AN AFTERNOON, MA.
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

04:23.600 --> 04:24.900
- OH, BUT IT IS.

04:24.900 --> 04:27.800
RAYMOND, DEAR, A MARRIAGE
IS ABOUT BEING TOGETHER,

04:27.800 --> 04:29.767
ABOUT CLOSENESS.

04:29.767 --> 04:31.733
- [scoffs]

04:35.267 --> 04:36.967
- SHE'S RIGHT.

04:36.967 --> 04:38.033
- WHAT?

04:38.033 --> 04:39.733
- IT IS ABOUT CLOSENESS,

04:39.733 --> 04:43.633
ABOUT HOW MUCH CLOSENESS
YOU CAN TAKE,

04:43.633 --> 04:46.200
ABOUT HOW CLOSE
YOU CAN GET TO KILLING HER

04:46.200 --> 04:49.767
BEFORE YOU
KILL YOURSELF.

04:49.767 --> 04:52.333
- WELL, I DID IT.

04:52.333 --> 04:55.900
AROUND THE BLOCK
IN 37 MINUTES.

04:55.900 --> 05:00.033
- HE BEAT YOUR RECORD, MARIE.

05:00.033 --> 05:03.300
- WHAT AM I
RUSHING BACK TO?

05:03.300 --> 05:05.500
RAYMOND, YOU NEED TO GO HOME

05:05.500 --> 05:07.200
AND PUT A STOP
TO DEBRA'S BEHAVIOR.

05:07.200 --> 05:09.000
- AW.
- IT'S NOT RIGHT.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.133
- LOOK, IT'S AN AFTERNOON.

05:10.133 --> 05:11.333
IT'S NOTHING,
ALL RIGHT?

05:11.333 --> 05:13.400
SHE JUST WANTS TIME
TO BE ALONE.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.000
- YEAH, WHEN I WAS
MARRIED TO JOANNE,

05:15.000 --> 05:16.367
SHE WANTED TIME ALONE.

05:16.367 --> 05:20.267
SHE USED IT TO PACK UP
AND MOVE OUT.

05:20.267 --> 05:21.767
- RAYMOND, WHATEVER HAPPENS,

05:21.767 --> 05:23.400
YOU AND I ARE KEEPING
THE CHILDREN.

05:23.400 --> 05:26.467
- OH, MA, ALL RIGHT,
WILL YOU STOP?

05:26.467 --> 05:27.967
- CHECK HER CREDIT CARD
STATEMENT.

05:27.967 --> 05:31.467
LOOK FOR THE WORD "U-HAUL."

05:31.467 --> 05:34.167
- LOOK, SHE'S PROBABLY
OVER THERE

05:34.167 --> 05:38.300
JUST DOING GIRL STUFF.

05:38.300 --> 05:40.167
- WHAT KIND OF GIRL STUFF?

05:40.167 --> 05:42.300
- I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.633
BUBBLE BATH,
TRYING ON OUTFITS,

05:44.633 --> 05:48.700
WALKING AROUND
WITH A BOOK ON HER HEAD.

05:48.700 --> 05:52.467
- WHATEVER HELPS YOU
SLEEP AT NIGHT, PEACHES.

05:52.467 --> 05:55.333
- HEY, LOOK, I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU THINK, ALL RIGHT?

05:55.333 --> 05:57.000
YOU DON'T HAVE THE FACTS.

06:01.100 --> 06:04.033
DEBRA HAS A MUSTACHE.

06:16.333 --> 06:18.767
- DO YOU MEAN A LOVER?

06:18.767 --> 06:20.667
- NO!
NO, NO, MOM!

06:20.667 --> 06:24.667
AND COULD YOU PLEASE NEVER
SAY THE WORD "LOVER"?

06:24.667 --> 06:27.133
I MEAN, SHE'S GOT A--A--

06:27.133 --> 06:30.100
A LIPULAR FORESTATION...

06:32.733 --> 06:34.367
YOU KNOW,

06:34.367 --> 06:36.267
FUZZ THING,
THAT'S ALL.

06:36.267 --> 06:38.133
SHE JUST NEEDS TIME
FOR THAT KIND OF

06:38.133 --> 06:41.333
MAINTENANCE.

06:41.333 --> 06:43.400
- HEY, I DON'T WANT
TO ALARM YOU, SON,

06:43.400 --> 06:47.167
BUT EVEN IF SHE HAD
A BIG, WOOLLY LUMBERJACK BEARD,

06:47.167 --> 06:50.267
SHE WOULDN'T NEED
A WHOLE AFTERNOON.

06:53.733 --> 06:56.133
- RAYMOND, THERE'S
SOMETHING GOING ON.

06:56.133 --> 06:57.533
- ALL RIGHT,
I DON'T CARE

06:57.533 --> 06:59.367
WHAT SHE'S DOING OVER THERE,
ALL RIGHT?

06:59.367 --> 07:01.433
I GAVE HER SOME TIME ALONE,
AND WHATEVER SHE'S DOING,

07:01.433 --> 07:02.933
IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH ME,
ALL RIGHT?

07:02.933 --> 07:06.733
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND,
SO LET'S JUST DROP IT.

07:16.867 --> 07:19.633
- IT'S EATING YOU UP ALIVE,
ISN'T IT, KID?

07:19.633 --> 07:21.667
- NO!

07:21.667 --> 07:23.033
NO, IT ISN'T.

07:23.033 --> 07:24.300
- WHERE YOU GOING?

07:24.300 --> 07:25.733
- I'M GOING OUTSIDE,
ALL RIGHT, HUH?

07:25.733 --> 07:28.600
OR DO YOU THINK YOU'RE THE KING
OF WHERE I GO?

07:28.600 --> 07:31.600
'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT, OKAY?
NOBODY IS.

07:35.933 --> 07:37.567
- VERY GOOD, ROBBIE.

07:37.567 --> 07:39.733
- TEAM EFFORT.

07:43.700 --> 07:46.633
- [sobbing]

08:24.133 --> 08:26.333
- HEY, ROBERT?

08:26.333 --> 08:27.867
- YEAH?

08:27.867 --> 08:29.833
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:29.833 --> 08:31.600
- PHYSICAL THERAPY.

08:31.600 --> 08:32.933
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

08:32.933 --> 08:35.300
- SHE--SHE WAS CRYING.

08:35.300 --> 08:37.867
- WHAT?
DEBRA WAS CRYING?

08:37.867 --> 08:41.533
- YEAH.
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

08:41.533 --> 08:42.400
- I DID NOTHING.

08:42.400 --> 08:43.767
I JUST--
I LOOKED IN THE WINDOW,

08:43.767 --> 08:45.967
AND SHE WAS SITTING
ON THE COUCH, CRYING.

08:45.967 --> 08:47.933
- WELL, I DIDN'T TELL YOU
TO GO SPY ON HER.

08:47.933 --> 08:49.333
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT.

08:49.333 --> 08:53.900
I ALREADY GOT THAT LECTURE
FROM THE MAILMAN.

08:53.900 --> 08:57.100
- WELL, WAS SHE WATCHING
A SAD MOVIE OR SOMETHING?

08:57.100 --> 08:59.367
- NO.
THE TV WASN'T EVEN ON.

08:59.367 --> 09:00.900
WHAT'S SHE CRYING ABOUT?

09:00.900 --> 09:03.133
- WHAT ARE YOU ASKING ME FOR?
GO TALK TO YOUR WIFE.

09:03.133 --> 09:04.767
- I CAN'T TALK TO HER NOW.

09:04.767 --> 09:06.967
SHE'LL KNOW THAT I WAS LOOKING
IN THE WINDOW.

09:06.967 --> 09:12.167
- LOOKING IN THE WINDOW.

09:12.167 --> 09:13.600
ALL RIGHT,
SO DON'T ASK HER.

09:13.600 --> 09:15.633
JUST GO BACK OVER THERE,
AND SEE WHAT'S WRONG.

09:15.633 --> 09:19.333
YOU KNOW, BE A HUSBAND!

09:22.833 --> 09:24.233
- YEAH, YEAH.

09:24.233 --> 09:28.633
YEAH, OKAY.

09:28.633 --> 09:31.500
- SHE COULD HAVE DONE
SO MUCH BETTER.

09:34.067 --> 09:35.200
- HONEY?
HELLO?

09:35.200 --> 09:36.400
- YEAH, HI, RAY.
I'M RIGHT HERE.

09:36.400 --> 09:37.867
- OH, HI.
HI.

09:37.867 --> 09:39.700
HEY, I'M NOT HERE.
YOU'RE STILL ALONE.

09:39.700 --> 09:41.200
- [chuckles]

09:41.200 --> 09:42.600
- THAT'S OKAY.
WHAT'S UP?

09:42.600 --> 09:44.033
- NOTHING.

09:44.033 --> 09:46.267
I JUST CAME BY 'CAUSE MY MOM
WANTS HER BIG SPOON BACK.

09:46.267 --> 09:48.267
YEAH, YOU KNOW HOW SHE IS
ABOUT THAT DAMN BIG SPOON.

09:48.267 --> 09:50.200
SO I'LL JUST--
I'M GONNA GET THAT,

09:50.200 --> 09:52.367
AND I'LL BE ON MY WAY,
THEN, THE SPOON.

09:52.367 --> 09:56.067
- OKAY.
THERE IT IS.

09:56.067 --> 09:57.200
- OKAY.
- HERE YOU GO.

09:57.200 --> 10:01.533
SEE YOU LATER.
- OKAY.

10:01.533 --> 10:03.700
HOW YOU DOING?
YOU ALL RIGHT? YOU OKAY?

10:03.700 --> 10:04.800
- YEAH, I'M FINE.

10:04.800 --> 10:05.867
- OKAY.
GOOD, GOOD.

10:05.867 --> 10:08.133
WE'RE GOOD OVER THERE TOO.

10:08.133 --> 10:09.600
SO YOU'RE GOOD?
YOU ALL RIGHT?

10:09.600 --> 10:12.567
YOU DIDN'T, LIKE,
STUB YOUR TOE OR ANYTHING?

10:12.567 --> 10:13.867
- STUB MY TOE?

10:13.867 --> 10:16.000
- YEAH, YOU KNOW, IT'S, LIKE--

10:16.000 --> 10:17.633
IT'S, LIKE, AN EXPRESSION.

10:17.633 --> 10:18.800
I MADE THAT UP.

10:18.800 --> 10:20.300
IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU'RE
IN A PLAY,

10:20.300 --> 10:22.033
YOU SAY, "BREAK A LEG."

10:22.033 --> 10:24.567
THIS IS LIKE,
YOU KNOW--

10:26.067 --> 10:27.300
IT'S LIKE A SMALL--

10:27.300 --> 10:28.700
IF YOU WERE IN, LIKE,
A SMALL PLACE--

10:28.700 --> 10:32.000
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE,
BUT THAT'S--

10:32.000 --> 10:34.367
THAT'S WHAT'S--ALL RIGHT, LET ME
GET THE BIG SPOON BACK.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.633
- OKAY, SEE YOU LATER.

10:53.667 --> 10:55.733
- I DON'T GET IT.

10:55.733 --> 10:57.700
- SHE STILL CRYING?

10:57.700 --> 10:58.933
- NO, NO.

10:58.933 --> 11:03.933
SHE'S FINE.
IT WAS SPOOKY.

11:03.933 --> 11:05.667
WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW?

11:05.667 --> 11:06.800
- CLENCHES.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.833
- OH.

11:08.833 --> 11:12.967
WILL YOU STOP WORKING
YOUR ASS FOR A MINUTE?

11:12.967 --> 11:14.933
- 98,

11:14.933 --> 11:16.633
99,

11:16.633 --> 11:17.767
100.

11:17.767 --> 11:19.000
YEAH.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.833
LET THAT BULL
TRY ME NOW.

11:20.833 --> 11:24.333
I COULD OPEN A JAR OF PICKLES
WITH THIS THING.

11:27.967 --> 11:29.033
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:29.033 --> 11:31.100
I MEAN,
WHY IS DEBRA CRYING?

11:31.100 --> 11:32.433
- WELL, OBVIOUSLY,
SHE'S UPSET,

11:32.433 --> 11:33.867
AND SHE DOESN'T
WANT YOU TO KNOW.

11:33.867 --> 11:34.867
WHAT DID YOU DO?

11:34.867 --> 11:36.733
- I DON'T KNOW.
I--

11:36.733 --> 11:38.967
I JOKED AROUND A LITTLE
ABOUT THE OLD COOKIE DUSTER.

11:38.967 --> 11:40.333
THAT'S ALL.

11:40.333 --> 11:43.033
- YEAH, WELL,
MAYBE YOU HURT HER FEELINGS.

11:43.033 --> 11:44.633
- NO.
SHE WAS A LITTLE ANNOYED.

11:44.633 --> 11:45.800
IT WAS TWO DAYS AGO,

11:45.800 --> 11:47.900
AND SHE MADE 100 JOKES
ABOUT MY BIG NOSE, OKAY?

11:47.900 --> 11:49.133
IT'S OVER.

11:49.133 --> 11:50.433
- ALL RIGHT,
OTHER THAN THE CRYING,

11:50.433 --> 11:52.367
HAS SHE BEEN ACTING DIFFERENTLY?

11:52.367 --> 11:57.433
- NO. NO.
SHE'S BEEN ACTING NORMAL.

11:57.433 --> 11:58.600
OH, NO.

11:58.600 --> 12:00.767
- WHAT?

12:00.767 --> 12:02.000
- ACTING NORMAL.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
WHAT IF
THE WHOLE THING'S AN ACT?

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
WHAT IF THE CRYING IS REAL,
AND ALL THE REST IS AN ACT?

12:07.000 --> 12:08.300
YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE,

12:08.300 --> 12:10.267
"OH, YOU'RE A WONDERFUL
HUSBAND, RAY.

12:10.267 --> 12:12.633
"OH, OH, WE HAVE SUCH
A HAPPY LIFE, RAY.

12:12.633 --> 12:15.900
"I LOVE YOU, RAY.
BYE, RAY.

12:15.900 --> 12:17.600
I HATE RAY."

12:21.067 --> 12:22.900
- I COULD SEE THAT.

12:22.900 --> 12:24.700
- COME ON.
NO.

12:24.700 --> 12:25.800
I MEAN,
IT MAKES SENSE.

12:25.800 --> 12:27.033
IT MAKES SENSE.

12:27.033 --> 12:28.367
SHE'S ALWAYS COMPLAINING
ABOUT ME.

12:28.367 --> 12:29.600
I FALL ASLEEP
WITH THE TV ON.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.433
I DON'T HELP OUT
AROUND THE HOUSE.

12:31.433 --> 12:33.133
SHE BOUGHT ME
THAT EXPENSIVE MOUTHWASH.

12:33.133 --> 12:34.400
I NEVER USE IT, RIGHT?

12:34.400 --> 12:37.000
SHE CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.400
- NAH, THAT'S NOT IT.

12:38.400 --> 12:39.900
BUT I DON'T
WANT TO LIE TO YOU.

12:39.900 --> 12:41.233
A COUPLE MINUTES
WITH THE MOUTHWASH

12:41.233 --> 12:44.400
WOULD BE TIME WELL-SPENT.

12:44.400 --> 12:48.633
- SHE THINKS I'M A LOUSY,
BAD-BREATHED HUSBAND.

12:48.633 --> 12:50.267
- LOOK, IT'S NOT LIKE
DEBRA DIDN'T KNOW

12:50.267 --> 12:52.633
WHAT SHE WAS GETTING.

12:52.633 --> 12:54.433
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT,
BUT AFTER TEN YEARS NOW,

12:54.433 --> 12:58.100
SHE'S SICK OF IT,
BUT SHE COULD TELL ME.

12:58.100 --> 12:59.167
SHE COULD TALK TO ME.

12:59.167 --> 13:01.233
SHE TELLS ME
EVERYTHING ELSE.

13:01.233 --> 13:04.167
WHY IS SHE
SITTING THERE CRYING?

13:04.167 --> 13:06.733
- I FEEL FOR YOU, CUBBY.

13:17.067 --> 13:18.967
- HI, HONEY.

13:18.967 --> 13:20.300
- HI.

13:22.067 --> 13:23.300
- OH, HEY,
LET ME GET THAT FOR YOU.

13:23.300 --> 13:24.533
- THAT'S OKAY.
I GOT IT.

13:24.533 --> 13:26.200
- NO, I WANT TO PUT THAT
AWAY FOR YOU.

13:26.200 --> 13:27.967
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
- NO, LET ME DO THIS.

13:27.967 --> 13:29.133
I WANT TO HELP OUT
AROUND HERE.

13:29.133 --> 13:31.767
LET ME PUT
THE LAUNDRY AWAY.

13:31.767 --> 13:35.367
WHERE DOES IT GO?

13:35.367 --> 13:38.600
- WOULD YOU JUST LET ME DO IT,
PLEASE, OKAY?

13:38.600 --> 13:40.600
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

13:40.600 --> 13:43.233
- OH, NOTHING,
JUST TRYING TO PITCH IN.

13:43.233 --> 13:46.067
THAT'S ALL.

13:46.067 --> 13:48.433
[exhaling heavily]
HOW ARE YOU?

13:51.500 --> 13:52.500
- WHAT?

13:52.500 --> 13:55.400
- [exhaling heavily]
HOW ARE YOU?

13:55.400 --> 13:56.933
THAT'S NICE, HUH?

13:56.933 --> 13:58.867
- SMELLS MINTY.
- YEAH.

13:58.867 --> 14:03.933
- TRYING TO PROVE TO ME
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN DRINKING?

14:03.933 --> 14:09.333
- I'M SORRY I'VE BEEN KIND OF
JERKY THE LAST COUPLE YEARS.

14:09.333 --> 14:11.100
- WHO SAID YOU WERE JERKY?

14:11.100 --> 14:14.067
- YOU DON'T
HAVE TO SAY IT.

14:14.067 --> 14:16.200
I KNOW.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.700
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU KNOW?

14:17.700 --> 14:19.700
- LOOK, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO HIDE YOUR FEELINGS.

14:19.700 --> 14:22.233
I KNOW WHY YOU CRY.

14:22.233 --> 14:24.600
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

14:26.233 --> 14:28.667
WERE YOU WATCHING ME TODAY?

14:28.667 --> 14:30.067
- LOOK, IT'S OKAY.

14:30.067 --> 14:31.133
- OH, MY GOD!

14:31.133 --> 14:32.933
RAY, I TELL YOU
I NEED PRIVACY,

14:32.933 --> 14:35.500
SO YOU SPY ON ME?

14:35.500 --> 14:40.033
- IT'S NOT SPYING
IF YOU LOVE THE PERSON.

14:40.033 --> 14:43.467
- THAT'S WHAT
PEEPING TOMS SAY.

14:43.467 --> 14:44.567
- LOOK, THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

14:44.567 --> 14:46.833
YOU REGRET YOUR LIFE
WITH ME.

14:46.833 --> 14:48.333
- I DO NOT!

14:48.333 --> 14:50.433
- OH, DON'T INSULT ME, OKAY?
COME ON.

14:50.433 --> 14:51.967
WE BOTH KNOW
THAT I'M LAZY.

14:51.967 --> 14:53.767
I DON'T HELP OUT
WITH THE KIDS,

14:53.767 --> 14:55.067
AND UNTIL RECENTLY,

14:55.067 --> 14:58.333
MY BREATH
HAS BEEN QUESTIONABLE.

14:58.333 --> 15:00.333
- YOU KNOW, NOW I ALMOST
HOPE YOU'VE BEEN DRINKING.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.500
- COME ON, LOOK, I'M TRYING
TO MAKE AN EFFORT HERE!

15:02.500 --> 15:03.633
- YEAH?

15:03.633 --> 15:05.567
WHY DON'T YOU
TRY NOT SPYING ON ME?

15:05.567 --> 15:07.200
- IF YOU THOUGHT
I WAS A BETTER HUSBAND,

15:07.200 --> 15:08.833
I WOULDN'T
HAVE TO SPY ON YOU.

15:08.833 --> 15:12.067
- YOU ARE AN EGOMANIAC.

15:12.067 --> 15:13.333
- WHAT?

15:13.333 --> 15:14.667
- YOU THINK EVERYTHING'S
ABOUT YOU.

15:14.667 --> 15:16.200
MY CRYING HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

15:16.200 --> 15:17.433
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHY I WAS CRYING?

15:17.433 --> 15:19.133
'CAUSE I WAS IN THE MOOD.

15:19.133 --> 15:20.333
- IN THE MOOD?

15:20.333 --> 15:21.700
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

15:21.700 --> 15:25.733
I JUST FELT LIKE IT.
IT'S CATHARTIC.

15:25.733 --> 15:28.433
- ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE TO
GET A DICTIONARY FOR IN HERE.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.167
- YOU KNOW THAT COMMERCIAL
WHERE THE LITTLE KID'S

15:33.167 --> 15:34.633
MAKING SOUP
FOR HIS SISTER

15:34.633 --> 15:37.100
AND HOW EVERY TIME IT COMES ON,
I GET ALL CHOKED UP?

15:37.100 --> 15:39.267
- YEAH.
- OKAY, I LIKE THAT.

15:39.267 --> 15:41.133
SOMETIMES I JUST LIKE TO CRY.

15:41.133 --> 15:42.667
IT'S LIKE A RELEASE.

15:42.667 --> 15:45.533
- SO YOU SAW THE SOUP COMMERCIAL
THIS AFTERNOON?

15:45.533 --> 15:49.433
- NO, I WAS JUST IN THE MOOD,
AND I MADE MYSELF CRY.

15:49.433 --> 15:51.600
- WELL, HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

15:51.600 --> 15:53.067
- I TAKE MY MASCARA OFF,

15:53.067 --> 15:55.233
AND SOMETIMES
I PUT ON A SAD SONG,

15:55.233 --> 15:57.133
AND I MAKE A CRYING FACE,

15:57.133 --> 16:01.900
AND IT JUST COMES OUT.

16:01.900 --> 16:03.367
- WHAT SONG?

16:03.367 --> 16:07.033
- THEME FROM "ICE CASTLES."

16:07.033 --> 16:08.233
- REALLY?

16:08.233 --> 16:09.733
- YES.
I WAS HAVING A GOOD CRY.

16:09.733 --> 16:10.833
THAT'S ALL IT IS.

16:10.833 --> 16:12.400
YOU KNOW,
HAVEN'T YOU EVER

16:12.400 --> 16:15.167
HEARD OF, YOU KNOW,
SOMEBODY SINGING THE BLUES?

16:15.167 --> 16:16.967
- SO ALL OF A SUDDEN,

16:16.967 --> 16:19.633
YOU'RE THIS OLD
BLUES-SINGING GUY

16:19.633 --> 16:22.167
WITH A MUSTACHE?

16:29.300 --> 16:31.167
- SEE, THAT'S WHY
I WANTED ALONE TIME TODAY,

16:31.167 --> 16:32.933
BECAUSE, OBVIOUSLY,
THIS ISN'T SOMETHING

16:32.933 --> 16:34.600
I CAN EXPLAIN TO YOU.

16:34.600 --> 16:37.900
- OKAY, SO YOU CRY
BECAUSE I'M STUPID.

16:37.900 --> 16:41.233
- I EAT ICE CREAM
BECAUSE YOU'RE STUPID.

16:43.133 --> 16:46.900
- LOOK, I JUST
DON'T LIKE YOU CRYING.

16:46.900 --> 16:48.533
- [sighs]

16:48.533 --> 16:50.733
RAY, LISTEN.
HERE, COME HERE.

16:50.733 --> 16:53.667
JUST SIT DOWN, OKAY?

16:53.667 --> 16:54.833
I JUST--

16:54.833 --> 16:56.667
I DON'T KNOW HOW
I CAN EXPLAIN THIS TO YOU.

16:56.667 --> 16:59.333
I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND,
BUT I JUST LIKE DOING IT.

16:59.333 --> 17:04.500
IT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.367
- OKAY.

17:06.367 --> 17:09.567
- WHAT, HAVEN'T YOU EVER
JUST FELT LIKE CRYING?

17:09.567 --> 17:11.300
- YEAH, WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS,
YOU KNOW?

17:11.300 --> 17:13.833
WHEN I SLAM MY FINGER
IN A CAR DOOR.

17:13.833 --> 17:15.167
I MEAN, I'M A HUMAN BEING,

17:15.167 --> 17:16.833
BUT I DON'T LIKE TO CRY.

17:16.833 --> 17:19.633
I DON'T SCHEDULE TIME TO CRY.

17:19.633 --> 17:20.633
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD.

17:20.633 --> 17:22.500
MAYBE THAT
WOULD BE GOOD FOR YOU.

17:22.500 --> 17:23.933
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL GET MY CALENDAR

17:23.933 --> 17:26.033
AND PUT TEARDROPS
ON WEDNESDAY.

17:26.033 --> 17:27.500
- OKAY, RAY.
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:27.500 --> 17:30.500
I WANT TO JUST GIVE YOU
SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT, OKAY?

17:30.500 --> 17:31.333
JUST LOOK AT ME.

17:31.333 --> 17:32.533
- WHAT?
- LOOK AT ME.

17:32.533 --> 17:34.233
LOOK AT ME!

17:34.233 --> 17:37.400
I JUST WANT YOU
TO FEEL SOME HONEST EMOTIONS,

17:37.400 --> 17:42.200
AND THEN LET'S SEE HOW YOU DO
WITH THAT, ALL RIGHT?

17:42.200 --> 17:46.700
OKAY, THE NIGHT ALLY WAS BORN.
REMEMBER THAT?

17:46.700 --> 17:49.067
THAT WAS THIS REALLY
LONG LABOR,

17:49.067 --> 17:50.933
AND YOU WERE SO WORRIED
ABOUT IT.

17:50.933 --> 17:53.433
AND THEN SHE CAME,
AND, OH, MY GOD,

17:53.433 --> 17:56.600
SHE WAS JUST SO BEAUTIFUL.

17:56.600 --> 17:59.167
AND THEN THE DOCTOR
HANDED HER TO YOU,

17:59.167 --> 18:01.267
AND HE SAID,

18:01.267 --> 18:03.667
"HERE'S YOUR DAUGHTER."

18:06.867 --> 18:10.000
- [laughs]

18:11.933 --> 18:13.233
- YOU ARE A MONSTER!

18:13.233 --> 18:15.200
- I'M NOT A MONSTER.
I'M JUST--

18:15.200 --> 18:16.767
OKAY, THEN I CRIED,
BUT YOU'RE TRYING TO--

18:16.767 --> 18:18.500
YOU'RE TRYING
TO MANUFACTURE THIS THING,

18:18.500 --> 18:22.367
AND YOU'RE MAKING
THAT--THAT FACE.

18:22.367 --> 18:24.300
IT'S JUST--
IT'S--IT'S FUNNY.

18:24.300 --> 18:25.733
- THAT'S FINE.
THAT'S FINE, RAY.

18:25.733 --> 18:27.300
- IT'S FUNNY. IT'S FUNNY.
- ALL RIGHT.

18:27.300 --> 18:28.633
- I FEEL GOOD, THOUGH.
I DO.

18:28.633 --> 18:30.900
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
SCHEDULE TIME FOR LAUGHING.

18:30.900 --> 18:32.567
- OKAY.
- [chuckles]

18:32.567 --> 18:34.633
- HOW ABOUT THE TIME
YOU WERE IN THE FIFTH GRADE,

18:34.633 --> 18:35.933
AND YOU CAME HOME,

18:35.933 --> 18:38.100
AND YOU FOUND OUT YOUR PARENTS
GAVE YOUR DOG AWAY?

18:38.100 --> 18:40.267
- THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

18:40.267 --> 18:41.367
- HOW DID THAT
MAKE YOU FEEL?

18:41.367 --> 18:46.833
- SHUT UP.
- UH-HUH.

18:46.833 --> 18:49.367
HOW'D YOU FEEL
ABOUT THAT, RAY, HUH?

18:49.367 --> 18:51.000
WHAT WAS YOUR DOG'S NAME?

18:51.000 --> 18:55.300
SHAMSKY NUMBER ONE,
WASN'T IT?

18:55.300 --> 18:57.467
THEY GAVE YOUR DOG AWAY.

19:03.033 --> 19:04.600
- [mock sobbing]

19:04.600 --> 19:05.900
- YOU!
- AH!

19:05.900 --> 19:08.400
AH!
COME ON!

19:08.400 --> 19:09.467
HEY.

19:09.467 --> 19:12.500
IF YOU HIT ME--
I'LL CRY IF YOU HIT ME.

19:12.500 --> 19:14.567
COME ON.

19:14.567 --> 19:16.000
WHAT?
ALL RIGHT, SO I DIDN'T CRY.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.200
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

19:17.200 --> 19:18.767
- YOU KNOW,
JUST FORGET IT, RAY.

19:18.767 --> 19:21.067
I MEAN, I'M TRYING TO GET YOU
TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING,

19:21.067 --> 19:23.333
BUT I GUESS
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

19:23.333 --> 19:24.667
- ALL RIGHT,
HOW ABOUT THIS?

19:24.667 --> 19:27.333
I GOT A GREAT IDEA
FOR TOMORROW.

19:27.333 --> 19:30.433
SINCE YOU LIKE
TO BE ALONE AND CRY

19:30.433 --> 19:33.933
AND MY MOM LIKES
TO BE WITH THE KIDS

19:33.933 --> 19:37.433
AND I HAPPEN
TO LIKE GOLF--

19:39.267 --> 19:41.133
- I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

19:41.133 --> 19:42.400
REMEMBER HOW YOU WANTED

19:42.400 --> 19:44.567
TO HELP ME
WITH THE LAUNDRY EARLIER?

19:44.567 --> 19:49.200
- UH-OH.

19:49.200 --> 19:51.000
- THERE'S TWO MORE LOADS
DOWNSTAIRS.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.500
- NO, HONEY--
HONEY, LISTEN--

19:52.500 --> 19:54.267
- AND THEN YOU NEED TO GO
