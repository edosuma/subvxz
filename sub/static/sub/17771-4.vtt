(Announcer)
Previously on Mech-X4...

00:05.125 --> 00:07.834
I'm moving the robot.
Uh, uh, uh.

00:07.917 --> 00:11.709
(Man) The monsters are sent
by people... terrible people.

00:11.792 --> 00:14.250
That's why I built
Mech-X4...

00:14.333 --> 00:15.709
so you could stop them,
Ryan.

00:15.792 --> 00:17.542
(Principal Grey)
I learned something valuable.

00:17.625 --> 00:21.625
- The robot has pilots... human pilots.
-Who are they?

00:21.709 --> 00:23.208
Somebody's planning
something big.

00:23.291 --> 00:25.166
We have to fight smarter.

00:25.250 --> 00:27.250
The whole monster
turned to ooze

00:27.333 --> 00:29.750
except for that object.

00:29.834 --> 00:33.291
It kind of looks
like the monster's heart.

00:37.333 --> 00:40.125
Mech-X4 has cost me
two monsters

00:40.208 --> 00:43.041
and a whole reservoir
of Primorphorous gel.

00:43.125 --> 00:44.834
The leader
can't be happy about that.

00:44.917 --> 00:47.417
Could've lost our place
in his new world.

00:47.500 --> 00:49.875
Now that I know
that Mech-X4 has pilots,

00:49.959 --> 00:51.709
we can hurt them.

00:51.792 --> 00:54.709
I'm designing a monster
to target them.

00:54.792 --> 00:58.709
Something
with incredible strength

00:58.792 --> 01:01.417
to immobilize the robot,

01:01.500 --> 01:05.917
claws to tear through
its armored plating...

01:09.417 --> 01:14.333
and a little extra surprise.

01:14.417 --> 01:15.834
The only loose end

01:15.917 --> 01:18.208
is Jaguasaur's
Primorphorous core.

01:18.291 --> 01:19.792
We must have it.

01:19.875 --> 01:24.458
Let's hope they're foolish enough
to try and open it.

01:27.166 --> 01:29.500
-Come on!
-No, no, no!

01:29.583 --> 01:31.625
Stop! Guys, guys!
Come on.

01:31.709 --> 01:33.000
I've been looking for that.

01:33.083 --> 01:35.125
I mean, you said we had to
crack open the monster heart.

01:35.208 --> 01:38.125
And it kind of evolved
from there, so...

01:38.208 --> 01:40.792
I know you like to have fun,
and I do too.

01:40.875 --> 01:42.792
But you don't understand
how important this is.

01:42.875 --> 01:45.000
This is our only clue
to finding out

01:45.083 --> 01:46.542
who's behind the monsters.

01:46.625 --> 01:48.834
Sorry, okay?
We'll be more cautious.

01:48.917 --> 01:50.750
-Tie game, dude.
-After this point.

01:50.834 --> 01:52.709
-Next to hit...
-No, no, guys, guys!

01:52.792 --> 01:54.792
Stop! No!

01:54.875 --> 01:57.083
(rumbling)

01:59.041 --> 02:00.875
What?

02:00.959 --> 02:03.291
Weird.
The heart just lit up.

02:03.375 --> 02:06.000
-(computer pinging)
-A signal!

02:07.375 --> 02:10.041
(theme music playing)

02:28.291 --> 02:29.709
How's Mech-X4 doing?

02:30.709 --> 02:32.333
Well...

02:32.709 --> 02:34.667
self-repair cycle
is just about done.

02:34.750 --> 02:36.917
-But...
-Boys.

02:38.709 --> 02:41.625
You look nice.

02:41.709 --> 02:44.375
Try not to say that
like you're shocked, son.

02:44.458 --> 02:46.709
Okay, I've got a busy day.

02:46.792 --> 02:49.667
So, uh, homework,
curfew, kisses.

02:49.750 --> 02:51.041
Not in that order.

02:51.125 --> 02:53.583
Who works at a food truck
all dressed up like that?

02:53.667 --> 02:55.792
Mom, you forgot your...

02:55.875 --> 02:58.542
She's got, like, a million emails
from someone named JJ

02:58.625 --> 03:00.667
-at Harper Futuristics.
-Here it comes.

03:00.750 --> 03:03.583
Quick, do your weirdo power thing
and read her phone emails.

03:03.667 --> 03:06.583
I will not.
That's Mom's and that's obnoxious.

03:06.667 --> 03:08.291
You do this every time.
You think Mom's dating.

03:08.375 --> 03:10.417
-So you do think that...
-That's not what I said.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.625
Dude,
Dad remarried years ago.

03:12.709 --> 03:13.959
So what if Mom's dating?

03:16.417 --> 03:18.125
Is that my phone?

03:19.458 --> 03:21.375
Oh, are we doing this now?

03:21.458 --> 03:23.500
Okay, let's have a peek
at yours.

03:23.583 --> 03:25.959
Ah, mmm.

03:26.041 --> 03:28.792
House party at Dane's
on Saturday.

03:28.875 --> 03:32.834
Won't be doing that.

03:32.917 --> 03:35.250
-Oh, wow!
-Okay, you two.

03:35.333 --> 03:37.750
-Love you. Bye.
-Love you too.

03:38.458 --> 03:40.208
So it sounds like
your weekend's free.

03:40.291 --> 03:42.083
Wanna go test out
the robot.

03:42.166 --> 03:43.417
Shove it.

03:47.208 --> 03:50.000
If the Spanish teacher
is just parking in your spot,

03:50.083 --> 03:52.250
just tell him
that you don't want him to...

03:52.333 --> 03:53.750
in Spanish.

03:53.834 --> 03:57.000
(door bangs open)

03:57.083 --> 03:58.500
(growls)

04:00.917 --> 04:02.625
He's here to apply
for the janitor job.

04:02.709 --> 04:03.667
You can go.

04:06.917 --> 04:08.417
(door slams)

04:11.667 --> 04:13.041
How can you stand
these people?

04:13.125 --> 04:15.792
It's our job to fit in.
You should try it

04:16.417 --> 04:18.583
if you want to survive
what's coming.

04:24.792 --> 04:27.542
The core signal is steady.

04:28.083 --> 04:32.583
Now to bring Clawboon to life
and destroy Mech-X4.

04:33.709 --> 04:36.542
Bring out
the new monster core,

04:37.333 --> 04:39.291
program it
with the DNA crystals,

04:39.375 --> 04:42.375
but just the right DNA
to do the job...

04:46.250 --> 04:49.458
take the core and get it
to the checkpoint.

04:57.375 --> 04:59.792
Make sure
you aren't followed.

05:03.750 --> 05:06.041
Find the drill site,

05:09.834 --> 05:13.875
drop the new monster core
into the Primorphorous gel...

05:18.959 --> 05:23.041
and get moving
before Clawboon is born.

05:40.625 --> 05:43.583
X-rays don't penetrate it,
saws can't cut it.

05:43.667 --> 05:46.208
It's like the meatloaf
at school.

05:46.291 --> 05:47.750
I wonder what's inside.

05:47.834 --> 05:50.792
I assume horse.
It tastes like horse...

05:50.875 --> 05:53.583
Not the meatloaf. This!

05:53.667 --> 05:55.667
We have to figure out
how to get it open.

05:55.750 --> 05:58.583
You know what? I can borrow
my mom's laser-hair-removal kit.

05:58.667 --> 06:01.500
That is the dumbest idea...

06:02.333 --> 06:04.125
Wait, did you say "laser"?

06:04.208 --> 06:06.208
Hair-removal kit.

06:08.875 --> 06:12.500
The Harper Quanta-Burst
nano-laser.

06:12.583 --> 06:14.709
It can cut through anything.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.250
Have you seen
my mom's unibrow?

06:18.208 --> 06:20.792
(ship rumbling)

06:20.875 --> 06:23.208
We're being attacked.
Let's move.

06:30.583 --> 06:33.375
-Monster?
-No, we're testing out the repair work.

06:33.458 --> 06:36.959
-How we doin', Mark?
-What do you think Mom and JJ are doing?

06:37.041 --> 06:38.709
-Should I call?
-Do you need to be tucked in?

06:38.792 --> 06:41.125
You need a bedtime story?
Come on, focus.

06:41.208 --> 06:42.542
Yeah, yeah.

06:43.333 --> 06:45.041
We're good.
You can stop now.

06:51.083 --> 06:53.875
Mom says she's working late,
but she loves us.

06:53.959 --> 06:55.834
That's code for "on a date."

06:55.917 --> 06:58.333
Yeah, one that's going well,
apparently.

06:58.417 --> 07:00.709
-Hey!
-All I'm saying

07:00.792 --> 07:03.291
is you cannot stop
what comes natural.

07:03.375 --> 07:06.083
I mean, your mother
is a very attractive woman.

07:06.166 --> 07:07.625
-Oh, that is so gross!
-Shut it.

07:07.709 --> 07:09.542
-That's my mom!
-I don't even wanna think about that.

07:09.625 --> 07:11.792
-Guys?
-I can't have my team get distracted.

07:11.875 --> 07:14.333
-I'm not getting distracted.
-Guys?

07:16.709 --> 07:17.875
-Give me that!
-No!

07:17.959 --> 07:19.750
-Guys!
-Did she say hi to me?

07:19.834 --> 07:21.083
-Let go, Mark.
-You're not helping!

07:21.166 --> 07:23.000
-Guys! Guys!
-(Mark) Back, Spyder!

07:23.083 --> 07:25.709
-(all arguing)
-Give me the phone!

07:25.792 --> 07:28.542
-It's mine! It's communal!
-Not the time, not the time!

07:28.625 --> 07:31.917
(growling)

07:42.875 --> 07:44.458
(grunting)

07:47.375 --> 07:49.250
Guys, we have to get back
to our stations.

08:04.917 --> 08:06.959
Spyder, give me some heat!

08:07.709 --> 08:09.166
(Spyder)
You got it.

08:23.166 --> 08:25.959
Are they getting better
at fighting us?

08:49.375 --> 08:51.083
(metal crunching)

08:53.792 --> 08:54.750
Ah!

08:55.917 --> 08:57.333
Ryan?

09:00.041 --> 09:04.834
(alarm sounding)

09:04.917 --> 09:06.834
We're getting killed here.
We gotta bounce.

09:06.917 --> 09:08.166
I can handle it.

09:08.250 --> 09:09.625
Dude, do not make me
come down there

09:09.709 --> 09:11.458
and disconnect you myself.

09:11.542 --> 09:13.375
Okay, fine!

09:28.125 --> 09:30.250
It's out of range.
It got away.

09:31.125 --> 09:33.458
But it ran.

09:33.542 --> 09:36.458
Did you see that?
Whoever is in there, we scared them.

09:36.542 --> 09:39.917
And when we find them,
we will do much worse.

09:42.375 --> 09:44.208
So any news
about the monster?

09:44.291 --> 09:46.041
Disappeared after we left.

09:46.875 --> 09:50.500
Your pulse is a bit high,
but the rest of your vitals check out.

09:51.959 --> 09:54.333
That thing did some
serious damage to Mech-X4.

09:54.417 --> 09:56.333
One more punch
and we would have been toast.

09:56.417 --> 09:59.458
It's like every game
of dodgeball I ever played

09:59.542 --> 10:01.542
all rolled into one.

10:02.417 --> 10:03.834
How you doin'?

10:03.917 --> 10:06.959
I feel like my brain
got stabbed by a fork.

10:07.041 --> 10:09.750
It's like somebody
specifically designed that monster

10:09.834 --> 10:11.875
to target you inside.

10:11.959 --> 10:13.417
Yeah, that spike
came right at me.

10:13.500 --> 10:16.375
We need to find out
who is making these monsters

10:16.458 --> 10:18.208
so we can bring the pain
to them.

10:18.291 --> 10:19.291
We do have one lead.

10:19.375 --> 10:21.625
It stopped blinking,
but this monster heart...

10:21.709 --> 10:23.625
Ah! Not too loud.

10:24.375 --> 10:26.875
We go to Harper Futuristics
and use the nano-laser

10:26.959 --> 10:29.500
to crack open
all the answers we need.

10:41.333 --> 10:44.417
(Harris)
Harper Futuristics.

10:44.500 --> 10:46.875
It's even more beautiful
than I dreamt.

10:47.500 --> 10:50.750
It's a complete rejection
of classical ornamentation.

10:50.834 --> 10:54.709
Like, a prime example
of neo-modernist architecture.

10:54.792 --> 10:57.542
My mom keeps a copy
of Architecture Today in the can.

10:57.625 --> 10:59.542
Okay, guys,
we need to focus.

10:59.625 --> 11:01.709
We need to get in, open
the monster heart, and get out.

11:01.792 --> 11:03.667
-No distractions.
-I don't see Mom.

11:03.750 --> 11:07.500
-What did I just say?
-"Something-something distractions."

11:07.583 --> 11:08.959
I'm here for Seth Harper.

11:09.041 --> 11:12.166
I am, uh...
I'm Colin St. Bernard.

11:12.250 --> 11:14.417
You're Colin St. Bernard?

11:14.500 --> 11:16.625
-The pro skater?
-The one and only.

11:17.417 --> 11:19.333
I'm here to sign
the endorsement deal

11:19.417 --> 11:20.667
for the Harper Oxygen drink.

11:20.750 --> 11:22.208
Really?

11:22.291 --> 11:24.458
'Cause Colin St. Bernard's
in his 30s

11:24.542 --> 11:26.667
and you look
like you're in high school.

11:27.291 --> 11:29.125
Well, check your computer.

11:37.041 --> 11:38.709
(humming)

11:38.792 --> 11:41.125
Hmm?

11:42.792 --> 11:45.291
I am so sorry,
Mr. St. Bernard.

11:45.375 --> 11:49.417
Here are
your all-access passes

11:49.500 --> 11:52.542
for you and your staff...

11:52.625 --> 11:54.125
Yeah, you must feel
really bad.

11:54.208 --> 11:55.959
Please accept
my sincerest apologies.

11:56.041 --> 11:58.041
Seth's not going to be too happy
when he hears about this.

11:58.125 --> 12:00.375
-Don't tell Seth, please.
-Yeah.

12:00.458 --> 12:03.959
Nice job, Mr. St. Bernard.

12:04.041 --> 12:06.709
-Why, thank you, Oprah.
-Oh, sweet!

12:06.792 --> 12:08.750
She's a role model
to us all.

12:08.834 --> 12:10.500
I'll be right there, JJ.

12:10.583 --> 12:12.875
Did I just hear "JJ"?

12:12.959 --> 12:15.542
-I'll catch up.
-Wait, no... Hey, distractions!

12:17.375 --> 12:19.083
(Harris)
This is so cool.

12:19.166 --> 12:21.417
(Spyder) Let's just crack open
the heart and bounce.

12:29.750 --> 12:32.083
What an amazing piece of tech.

12:32.500 --> 12:36.000
I barely feel guilty breaking
into this place to use it.

12:39.625 --> 12:41.333
-Harris, uh...
-Shh.

12:41.417 --> 12:44.166
Look at that beam!
It's perfect.

12:48.583 --> 12:51.125
(gasps)
It's lighting up again.

12:51.208 --> 12:52.500
Have you guys seen this?

12:52.583 --> 12:55.500
Oprah,
using my billion dollar laser?

12:55.583 --> 12:57.291
Yeah, I'm seeing that.

12:58.542 --> 13:00.375
Hey, I... Oh.

13:00.458 --> 13:03.959
You're Seth Harper.

13:04.041 --> 13:06.250
And you're trespassing.

13:06.333 --> 13:08.458
You're all going
to jail.

13:08.542 --> 13:11.208
-What?
-(laughs) Come on, I'm kidding!

13:11.291 --> 13:13.959
-(all laughing)
-Your face was like, "Ahh!"

13:14.041 --> 13:16.291
But seriously, you kids
are in a lot of trouble.

13:16.375 --> 13:18.083
-(All) Oh, what?
-Yeah.

13:18.166 --> 13:20.250
Whoa. Okay.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.959
(Spyder)
Just easy on the shoulders.

13:23.041 --> 13:26.208
(Harris)
Okay. Yeah.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.250
Got 'em.

13:38.375 --> 13:41.000
So give me a good reason

13:41.083 --> 13:44.041
why I should not call
your parents.

13:44.125 --> 13:45.041
Seriously.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.291
Well, yeah, we found that thing
in the forest and we thought

13:47.375 --> 13:49.417
it might have something
to do with the monsters.

13:51.208 --> 13:53.125
And you didn't think to,
I don't know,

13:53.208 --> 13:54.625
take it to the authorities?

13:54.709 --> 13:58.125
Well, I thought
I could figure it out myself.

13:58.208 --> 13:59.458
Really?

13:59.542 --> 14:02.500
I like that gumption.
You know, that reminds me...

14:02.583 --> 14:04.625
when I was your age,

14:04.709 --> 14:08.166
I broke into
the first Space-X rocket

14:08.250 --> 14:10.333
and I hid there
just to meet Elon Musk.

14:10.417 --> 14:11.709
-Really?
-Whoa, that's so cool!

14:11.792 --> 14:14.000
No, that's illegal.
I wouldn't do that.

14:14.083 --> 14:15.458
Or would I?

14:16.166 --> 14:17.625
Right?

14:19.417 --> 14:23.959
Interesting. I just found out
that there was four of you.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.041
So that means one's missing.

14:33.166 --> 14:34.792
(indistinct chatter)

14:35.542 --> 14:38.208
-Stay cool, J.
-Thanks. You're a good man.

14:40.083 --> 14:44.208
Enjoying your meal, JJ?
Where is my mom...

14:44.291 --> 14:47.083
-JJ?
-Hey there, little guy.

14:47.166 --> 14:50.792
You lost your mommy?
Stay calm.

14:50.875 --> 14:54.250
-We'll find your mommy.
-I'm 16, dude.

14:54.333 --> 14:57.208
A little boy
has lost his mommy.

14:57.291 --> 14:59.166
I'm not a little boy.

14:59.250 --> 15:01.000
I'm almost a man.

15:02.750 --> 15:06.542
-Whatever.
-Don't run away, little guy.

15:06.625 --> 15:08.458
Here's a lolly!

15:11.458 --> 15:13.417
Mr. Harper?

15:13.500 --> 15:15.583
What are you doing?

15:15.667 --> 15:18.083
I'm deciding.

15:21.375 --> 15:22.750
And I've decided.

15:23.333 --> 15:24.959
I like you guys!

15:25.041 --> 15:26.667
-Awesome!
-Not you.

15:26.750 --> 15:28.250
-Okay.
-But definitely you.

15:28.333 --> 15:31.125
-Yes!
-Intelligence, initiative, daring!

15:31.208 --> 15:34.083
-(alarm sounding)
-Oh, fire alarm?

15:34.166 --> 15:36.250
Okay, we will continue this
outside.

15:36.333 --> 15:39.166
-But the monster heart...
-People first, science later.

15:39.250 --> 15:41.917
Let's save some people!

15:45.083 --> 15:47.709
(alarm continues wailing)

15:47.792 --> 15:51.333
Okay, everybody!
Nobody use the elevators.

15:51.417 --> 15:53.583
Nobody use your hoverboards
or skates.

15:53.667 --> 15:55.667
Stairs only, guys!

15:55.750 --> 15:57.625
Wait, guys. Wait.

15:58.959 --> 16:01.375
Okay, guys, it's a false alarm.
I just scanned the systems.

16:01.458 --> 16:03.375
Why would someone do that.

16:03.458 --> 16:05.792
Well,
we bring the heart here

16:05.875 --> 16:08.083
and suddenly
there's a fake fire.

16:08.166 --> 16:10.333
-Somebody's after the heart.
-We should tell Harper.

16:10.417 --> 16:12.417
No, no, no.
Keep going

16:12.500 --> 16:15.000
and I will meet you guys outside
and I'll get the heart, okay?

16:15.083 --> 16:18.291
Make sure he doesn't come back
just in case I use my power.

16:18.375 --> 16:21.417
Safety first.
All of your work can wait.

16:31.750 --> 16:34.041
(gas escaping)

16:38.000 --> 16:40.542
(coughing)

16:40.625 --> 16:42.417
Gotta hide my face.

17:08.041 --> 17:09.750
(whirring)

17:26.834 --> 17:29.875
(Female voice) You're not leaving
with the Primorphorous core.

17:29.959 --> 17:32.041
You mean the monster heart?

17:32.125 --> 17:34.792
Monster heart?

17:58.375 --> 17:59.917
Ah!

18:18.542 --> 18:21.166
You brought that here,
didn't you?

18:21.250 --> 18:24.625
You're one
of the robot's pilots.

18:24.709 --> 18:26.333
Were you afraid

18:26.417 --> 18:29.166
when the monster pierced
your robot's skull?

18:29.250 --> 18:31.959
All you need to know
is you're toast.

19:00.375 --> 19:02.750
Hey, Dingus, you in here?

19:02.834 --> 19:04.709
No, get out of here!

19:05.792 --> 19:08.417
(Female)
Give me the core now!

19:09.792 --> 19:11.375
Okay. Don't hurt him.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.458
Just take it.

19:21.542 --> 19:23.542
Let's get out of here!

19:28.000 --> 19:30.709
-(sirens wailing)
-(both coughing)

19:31.500 --> 19:33.667
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. You?

19:34.583 --> 19:36.500
-Sorry, man.
-Wait, for what?

19:36.583 --> 19:37.834
I should have
been there to help you,

19:37.917 --> 19:40.041
but I got distracted
and we lost the monster heart.

19:40.125 --> 19:41.625
Yeah!
You really messed this up.

19:41.709 --> 19:44.041
-Totally Ryan Walkered it.
-Is that how you apologize?

19:44.125 --> 19:45.875
Great. I Ryan Walkered
the apology too?

19:45.959 --> 19:47.041
You're hilarious.

19:47.125 --> 19:48.959
What are you two
doing here?

19:49.041 --> 19:50.500
I was wondering
the same thing.

19:50.583 --> 19:53.959
I was here signing a contract
to cater an event.

19:54.041 --> 19:55.375
Wait, so Mom's here
for a job?

19:55.458 --> 19:57.792
So these are your kids, huh?

19:57.875 --> 20:00.917
Mm-hmm.
Oh, thank you, Miss Janson.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.083
Please, it's Jessica.
But everyone calls me...

20:03.166 --> 20:05.208
JJ.
You're JJ.

20:05.291 --> 20:08.125
-She's JJ.
-So Mom's not dating anyone.

20:08.208 --> 20:10.667
No, but she is getting tired
of your snooping,

20:10.750 --> 20:13.667
especially when you follow me
to a burning building.

20:13.750 --> 20:14.917
For the record,
no one was hurt.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.792
Only a lab got destroyed.

20:16.875 --> 20:18.542
Phone, now.

20:20.834 --> 20:23.125
Let's take a look
at your calendar.

20:24.417 --> 20:27.000
Ahem, grounded for...

20:27.083 --> 20:28.750
a month.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.166
Not now, little man.
Did I hear you say

20:31.250 --> 20:33.917
that you're
not dating anyone?

20:36.166 --> 20:37.583
Are you asking me out?

20:37.667 --> 20:38.709
Maybe.

20:40.834 --> 20:43.583
-Would that annoy you?
-Definitely.

20:43.667 --> 20:46.500
Saturday. 8:00 PM.
Persian food.

20:46.583 --> 20:48.792
Bold. I like it.

20:48.875 --> 20:52.041
JJ, clear my schedule.
Let's talk restaurants.

20:52.125 --> 20:54.500
-Do you have a favorite?
-I do, actually...

20:54.583 --> 20:57.417
So he's great-looking
and he's loaded.

20:57.500 --> 20:59.417
-Great going, Cupid.
-Hey!

20:59.500 --> 21:02.750
-You better treat her right now!
-Dude, that is my mom!

21:11.250 --> 21:12.834
You got
the Primorphorous core back.

21:12.917 --> 21:15.500
And something even better.

21:18.208 --> 21:20.792
-Name's fake.
-Face is real.

21:26.333 --> 21:28.125
Ryan Walker.

21:33.792 --> 21:37.375
(theme music playing)
