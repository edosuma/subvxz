from different countries.

we were working on this?

22:33.833 --> 22:35.708
It wouldn't have helped you to know.

that you had a prior relationship
with a mark.

to meet here where we won't be overheard?

Thank you, Aunty.

30:19.625 --> 30:20.958
[Chike] Do you know them?

That's my dad, Edem, and Aunt Enitan.

It's good.

So what happened?

30:43.541 --> 30:45.708
You were gone for 13 years.

30:47.416 --> 30:52.291
Well, during the 2004 bank consolidation,

30:53.166 --> 30:55.875
I made a takeover bid
with a different investor.

than sell his company.

I thought I was helping out.

31:05.500 --> 31:08.083
He, on the other hand,
thought it was a betrayal.

31:08.625 --> 31:12.708
Sorry, um, it's getting late,
and I'm working a double shift tomorrow.

31:13.041 --> 31:15.708
Oh, right, of course.

-Okay, so.

31:32.666 --> 31:34.458
[Chike] No, but we had a deal, no, like,

Yeah, it's always one thing or the other.

31:57.791 --> 31:58.958
Please, let's go.

32:00.083 --> 32:03.625
This is my baby brother Bamidele.

32:03.708 --> 32:06.833
Although with the way he's acting,
you can't really tell.

32:06.916 --> 32:08.166
This is Janet.

32:08.250 --> 32:09.125
Hello.

32:09.458 --> 32:12.333
Please get in the car,

-[chuckles]

32:30.416 --> 32:31.708
What are you doing?

32:32.166 --> 32:33.833
We had a plan.

32:35.833 --> 32:37.500
I changed the plans.

32:38.041 --> 32:41.083
We were supposed to be playing you
as a cooler, aloof older man.

of the family shit?

32:43.958 --> 32:45.708
How is that attractive to anybody?

32:47.125 --> 32:49.750
You know, I really don't need
to explain myself to anyone.

32:49.833 --> 32:53.500
Stop messing with my plan.

32:54.250 --> 32:56.291
I'll slap that stupid look off your face.

33:05.458 --> 33:06.625
[Chike] This is new.

33:07.458 --> 33:09.791
Are you hoping to bring
your boyfriend here?

33:11.000 --> 33:12.666
Dimeji doesn't come here.

33:13.166 --> 33:16.041
He feels bad about what's been done
to the children in his name.

33:16.375 --> 33:19.208
What's been done to these children
except play and free food.

33:19.625 --> 33:20.875
That boy over there.

33:21.250 --> 33:23.291
[Grace] He got the vaccination
less than a year ago.

33:23.375 --> 33:25.500
[Chike] How do you know he wasn't
in the wheelchair before?

33:25.583 --> 33:28.083
Because he was the case
I used to find Dimeji.

33:28.166 --> 33:30.583
That boy was one of the brightest kids
in this orphanage.

33:30.666 --> 33:32.916
Grace, this isn't our problem.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.166
We need to focus.

33:34.250 --> 33:36.875
Chike, I cannot even understand
how you're not bothered.

33:36.958 --> 33:38.041
We're not the ones doing it.

33:38.125 --> 33:39.541
But we're letting them do it.

33:39.625 --> 33:40.791
Grace, I get it.

33:40.875 --> 33:42.791
You like Pastor Dimeji,
you like these children,

33:42.875 --> 33:44.708
and what's happening to them is a tragedy.

33:44.791 --> 33:46.333
But, Grace, this isn't our fight.

It is enough for you to know
I have my reasons...

to no longer pry into my affairs.

just because of one mistake.

40:37.958 --> 40:39.583
you think you have all the answers.

40:40.125 --> 40:42.208
But you know, life deals you a bad hand

40:42.291 --> 40:45.250
and then you lose something as precious
as your entire family.

40:46.833 --> 40:47.916
[Edem] I regret it.

40:48.375 --> 40:51.416
And I sincerely hope you never have
to face the same fate.

40:51.916 --> 40:52.791
[Chike] Hmm.

40:53.958 --> 40:55.291
I know a girl...

40:56.708 --> 40:58.333
the only girl in her family.

40:58.416 --> 41:01.208
Her parents tried to convince her
to go to Italy.

41:02.041 --> 41:03.291
Sometimes...

41:03.875 --> 41:05.541
it's better to lose your family.

41:06.583 --> 41:08.333
What's wrong with going to Italy?

41:08.833 --> 41:10.916
[laughs]

41:11.000 --> 41:12.541
[Motunrayo] Please forgive my brother.

41:12.625 --> 41:15.708
-He has lived a very sheltered life.
-No, no, no. I just...

41:16.125 --> 41:19.125
They wanted her to go to Italy
to become a prostitute.

41:19.208 --> 41:20.708
-Oh.
-So she could send money home.

41:20.791 --> 41:22.125
Oh, oh, oh.

41:22.208 --> 41:23.416
-[chuckles]
-Sorry.

41:23.500 --> 41:27.625
Listen, I think we're getting intense,
let us all calm down a little.

41:27.916 --> 41:29.208
[Edem] I have to be in the kitchen.

41:29.291 --> 41:30.291
I have things to do.

41:30.416 --> 41:31.833
Janet, kitchen now.

41:39.125 --> 41:40.125
What are you playing at?

41:40.208 --> 41:41.916
What am I playing at?
What are you playing at?

41:42.000 --> 41:43.958
It's obvious you're not trying
to get her to marry you.

41:44.416 --> 41:46.666
-[Edem] This is my plan. Stick to it.
-[Chike] Your plan?

41:46.750 --> 41:47.958
I thought it was my plan.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.500
You think this is a joke?

41:53.666 --> 41:55.916
Really? You want to do this right now?

41:57.666 --> 41:58.666
[thumps]

42:01.083 --> 42:02.125
[mutters]

42:06.500 --> 42:07.833
One sec.

42:11.708 --> 42:13.375
I will not say it again.

42:21.791 --> 42:24.333
We need to talk. Now.

42:25.791 --> 42:28.083
[keyboard clacking]

42:30.666 --> 42:32.125
Took you long enough.

42:32.208 --> 42:33.833
[Grace] I told you I was busy.

42:36.791 --> 42:39.166
Edem is not being straightforward with us.

42:39.500 --> 42:41.250
We need to find out what's going on.

42:41.333 --> 42:42.791
[Grace] Who cares what's going on?

42:43.666 --> 42:44.625
[sighs]

42:45.000 --> 42:48.083
He's just a broke playboy
who wants to stay on the gravy train.

42:48.791 --> 42:52.583
Besides, I'm really confused
as to why you're concerned with that.

42:52.666 --> 42:55.958
Rather than being concerned with
actual children who are being poisoned

42:56.041 --> 42:58.083
-by a pharmaceutical company.
-Jesus!

42:58.166 --> 42:59.666
Why does this bother you so much?

42:59.750 --> 43:01.750
Why does it not bother you at all?

43:02.333 --> 43:03.166
[scoffs]

43:06.458 --> 43:07.458
[mumbles]

43:15.541 --> 43:17.458
That is Tobias Vexler.

43:17.541 --> 43:18.666
He's VP Africa.

43:18.750 --> 43:20.541
He's the one that hired us, scroll.

43:23.208 --> 43:25.750
Now, that is Vanessa Strowman.

43:26.083 --> 43:27.708
She's head of compliance.

43:28.291 --> 43:32.375
She received an e-mail yesterday,
with the video of the blackmail.

43:33.291 --> 43:36.458
I expect Tobias is heading back to HQ
to face the music.

43:38.791 --> 43:40.166
I thought you didn't care.

43:40.250 --> 43:42.125
I don't, but you do.

43:42.208 --> 43:43.625
You are my best friend, so...

43:45.291 --> 43:46.291
[Grace] Chike.

43:46.750 --> 43:47.666
Chike.

43:48.750 --> 43:49.958
In my research,

43:50.250 --> 43:54.166
I found out that the Elesho's once had
a three-year-old daughter who had died.

43:54.250 --> 43:55.458
I didn't think anything of it

43:55.541 --> 43:58.750
until one of my clients and contacts
sent me this picture.

43:59.708 --> 44:02.291
[Grace] Her eyes are green
just like Madame's.

44:04.708 --> 44:07.166
She is your child.

44:08.083 --> 44:10.083
[foreboding music]

44:17.166 --> 44:18.458
They took your child?

44:25.416 --> 44:26.833
Is she Mr. Elesho's?

44:32.458 --> 44:35.833
I thought I told you
not to get involved in my affairs.

44:36.416 --> 44:37.875
You involved me.

44:48.458 --> 44:50.666
[gloomy music]

44:53.958 --> 44:55.125
Nurse!

44:56.416 --> 44:57.583
Nur...

45:01.166 --> 45:03.541
No... Ow...

45:03.958 --> 45:05.583
No.
[groans]

45:06.083 --> 45:08.375
Oh, no, no, no.

45:08.458 --> 45:10.375
[Madame pants]

45:10.458 --> 45:11.958
Please, please.

45:12.791 --> 45:14.083
I told you.

45:14.833 --> 45:16.833
He belongs to me.

45:18.625 --> 45:19.625
Him.

45:19.833 --> 45:21.916
And everything he creates.

45:23.541 --> 45:26.541
Including that child
you tried to steal from his body.

45:26.625 --> 45:30.166
Please, where is my baby? Please.

45:31.875 --> 45:35.250
Run away and hide.

45:35.833 --> 45:37.458
[Madame sobbing]

45:37.541 --> 45:41.333
Even fly as far as you can go.

45:41.416 --> 45:42.708
[Madame] Please.

45:43.208 --> 45:46.375
Because if I ever see you again...

45:48.708 --> 45:50.083
I will kill you.

45:50.875 --> 45:54.041
[whimpering]

45:55.583 --> 45:57.208
No, no, please, please.

45:57.291 --> 45:59.583
Ah! Uh, please. Wait, wait, wait.

45:59.666 --> 46:01.916
[groans, sobs]

46:02.791 --> 46:05.333
[Madame] Please wait, wait, wait!

46:05.416 --> 46:06.958
-[Madame groans]
-[clatters]

46:07.041 --> 46:09.375
[Madame] Ah, please wait!

46:09.458 --> 46:11.375
Wait, wait! My baby!
[sobbing]

46:13.041 --> 46:15.000
[screaming]

46:17.041 --> 46:18.875
They took my baby and killed her.

46:18.958 --> 46:20.041
[Chike sighs]

46:21.958 --> 46:23.458
Why didn't you tell me?

46:25.666 --> 46:27.125
I needed you not to know.

46:28.541 --> 46:29.833
-Then what--
-[door opens]

46:32.083 --> 46:34.250
[approaching footsteps]

46:35.791 --> 46:36.708
Kelly?

46:36.791 --> 46:38.208
My name is Dier Spencer.

46:38.291 --> 46:40.958
And I'm an agent with the US
Federal Investigation Division.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.333
You finally sold us out.

46:45.875 --> 46:47.750
[Madame] The NDLEA couldn't meet my price,

46:47.833 --> 46:49.708
but the American government could.

46:49.791 --> 46:52.958
You mentioned you had some information
about some persons of interest

46:53.041 --> 46:54.458
that went missing today.

46:54.958 --> 46:56.416
[Madame] Two drug mules.

46:58.125 --> 46:59.541
Do you know where they are?

47:00.458 --> 47:01.666
[Madame] I might.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.166
I planned to turn you in
almost immediately,

47:04.250 --> 47:07.583
but you proved to be very useful
so I kept postponing.

47:07.875 --> 47:09.583
-Lucky us.
-[Madame] Mm.

47:09.916 --> 47:10.875
Grace!

47:12.583 --> 47:14.875
Grace, Grace, run, run! It's a trap.

47:15.833 --> 47:18.333
-It's a trap.
-Grace doesn't need to run.

47:19.041 --> 47:19.875
Grace.

47:19.958 --> 47:20.833
Yes, Madame.

47:20.916 --> 47:23.833
Hand the original surveillance footage
to Agent Spencer.

47:26.708 --> 47:28.000
You bitch.

47:28.583 --> 47:30.125
They were going to send
my mother to prison

47:30.208 --> 47:31.583
because of the money I sent to her.

47:31.666 --> 47:33.541
My fault, but I couldn't let that happen.

47:33.625 --> 47:35.166
You chose your mother over me?

47:38.875 --> 47:39.958
-[grunting]
-[Grace groaning]

47:43.458 --> 47:46.416
[Chike grunting]

47:50.125 --> 47:51.125
[thwacks]

47:55.375 --> 47:56.458
[handcuffs click]

48:00.541 --> 48:01.500
[spits]

48:03.083 --> 48:04.916
So what was the price you paid for me?

48:05.875 --> 48:06.875
Hmm?

48:07.625 --> 48:09.166
Hope it was worth it.

48:09.500 --> 48:10.458
[Madame] Grace.

48:14.125 --> 48:15.041
[rips]

48:16.208 --> 48:18.541
[somber music]

48:38.166 --> 48:40.333
[Kelly] I recently arrested this person.

48:40.458 --> 48:41.750
Chike Ekeh.

48:41.833 --> 48:44.291
She's a drug dealer and a con-artist,

48:44.541 --> 48:47.125
and your son Bamidele Elesho,

48:47.208 --> 48:49.875
was recently part
of her latest confidence scheme.

48:50.708 --> 48:52.500
This is nonsense. This is nonsense.

48:52.583 --> 48:54.375
We actually have evidence
on both of your meetings.

48:54.458 --> 48:56.333
This is ridiculous, I was at, uh...

48:56.416 --> 48:57.625
the hotel to meet Blue Stream--

48:57.708 --> 48:58.666
Stream Capital.

48:58.750 --> 48:59.625
Yes!

49:00.125 --> 49:03.541
[camera shutter clicking]

49:03.625 --> 49:06.083
We had e-mail exchanges showing that,

49:06.166 --> 49:08.666
Blue Stream Capital
was a front for your meeting.

49:08.750 --> 49:10.916
I, I never sent any e-mail.

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
And you don't even have proof
that I did this.

49:13.541 --> 49:14.958
[camera shutter clicks]

49:15.541 --> 49:17.583
I'm actually doing this as courtesy.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.083
You are a US citizen,

49:20.166 --> 49:22.416
and you're a personal friend
of the ambassador.

49:22.791 --> 49:24.750
We will be charging Miss Ekeh next week,

49:24.833 --> 49:27.041
and the information
on your son will be out.

49:27.666 --> 49:30.541
But, my son says he is innocent.

49:30.625 --> 49:31.583
Yeah.

49:31.666 --> 49:35.416
Miss Ekeh was part of an international
drug smuggling ring.

49:35.958 --> 49:39.375
It is more likely that any
of her associates will be flagged.

49:39.750 --> 49:40.791
I see.

49:43.791 --> 49:45.833
Agent Spencer, thank you.

49:46.458 --> 49:48.083
Regards to the ambassador.

49:56.083 --> 49:57.125
-Bamidele.
-Mom.

49:57.208 --> 49:59.500
[stutters]
I didn't...

49:59.583 --> 50:00.916
I didn't do that, Mom.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.250
I swear, I didn't.

50:02.333 --> 50:03.666
I only met that woman once!

50:04.166 --> 50:06.916
When she took us
to, to Uncle Edem's house, right?

50:07.500 --> 50:08.583
Tell her!

50:09.333 --> 50:10.875
What am I supposed to say?

50:11.208 --> 50:14.166
I met a random woman
who turned out to be Uncle Edem's tenant.

50:14.250 --> 50:16.291
How am I supposed to know
when you met her?

50:16.375 --> 50:18.041
She was working with Edem.

50:18.125 --> 50:19.791
You were working with Edem.

50:19.875 --> 50:21.333
-Mom... Mom...
-Bamidele, how could you?

50:21.416 --> 50:23.125
Mom, I'll never do such.

50:23.208 --> 50:26.375
I will never do anything like that, Mom,
I swear to you, I will never... Oh...

50:26.458 --> 50:29.291
Son, you will have to give up
your shares in Daraja.

50:30.291 --> 50:31.375
Mom.

50:31.708 --> 50:34.875
Your name has just been linked
with a drug dealer.

50:34.958 --> 50:36.208
What if he's innocent?

50:36.916 --> 50:38.500
No, it doesn't matter.

50:38.583 --> 50:40.125
No one will believe it,

50:40.208 --> 50:42.458
and the entire family will be ruined.

50:42.541 --> 50:43.416
Mom.

50:43.500 --> 50:46.041
Son, you will have to do this
for the family

50:46.125 --> 50:48.083
and you will have to do it now.

50:50.250 --> 50:51.375
Motunrayo.

50:51.666 --> 50:53.208
You will take the shares.

50:53.875 --> 50:54.750
[Motunrayo] What?

50:54.833 --> 50:55.666
Why?

50:55.750 --> 50:57.625
You are the future of the family

50:57.708 --> 50:59.958
and you will have to do this one.

51:00.041 --> 51:01.041

51:45.750 --> 51:46.916

51:47.625 --> 51:49.291

-No, I am her mother!
-Her mother won't take

52:39.583 --> 52:41.625
this rubbish from you.
Stop this rubbish. C'mon, stop this!

52:41.708 --> 52:43.875
[Mrs. Elesho] I am her mother,
you were supposed to be with me

52:43.958 --> 52:46.416
instead of running off
with that bloody slut!

55:05.625 --> 55:09.125
I'm so, so sorry.

55:09.500 --> 55:12.625
[sobbing]

55:19.291 --> 55:21.958
[both whimpering]

55:23.666 --> 55:26.333
She has refused to leave
since she got here.

55:32.916 --> 55:34.833
[Edem] Motunrayo, my dear.

55:38.500 --> 55:40.625
Your people are frantic with worry.

55:42.333 --> 55:43.750
You have to go home.

55:44.458 --> 55:45.583
Please.

55:48.541 --> 55:51.916
Uncle Edem, I killed her.

55:53.041 --> 55:54.708
I killed Charity.

55:55.083 --> 55:56.291
No, you didn't.

55:58.375 --> 55:59.750
[Motunrayo] I was watching her.

56:01.958 --> 56:05.833
I took my eyes off for a second...

56:08.666 --> 56:11.041
and she jumped off the balcony.

56:12.291 --> 56:13.708
It was just...

56:14.625 --> 56:16.458
for a second, I swear.

56:21.291 --> 56:22.958
[Edem] It's not your fault.

56:24.041 --> 56:25.333
Are you hearing me?

56:26.583 --> 56:28.000
It was an accident.

56:28.458 --> 56:29.958
It can happen to anyone.

56:31.500 --> 56:33.000
I need you to go home.

56:33.875 --> 56:35.958
So, your people can take care of you.

56:38.041 --> 56:40.875
I owe you, Aunty Enitan.

56:41.541 --> 56:43.333
More than I can ever repay.

56:45.333 --> 56:49.166
If there is anything you need from me...

56:51.958 --> 56:54.458
it's yours without question.

56:57.750 --> 56:59.208
I'm so sorry.

57:06.958 --> 57:09.041
[somber music]

57:17.041 --> 57:18.166
Miss Motunrayo.

57:19.291 --> 57:21.208
Will you be kind to walk me out?

57:25.833 --> 57:27.125
Of course.

57:36.500 --> 57:39.000
[somber music]

57:51.000 --> 57:53.083
[upbeat music]

57:57.791 --> 57:59.083
Hey!

58:02.041 --> 58:04.541
-Look at you.
-[laughs]

58:07.166 --> 58:08.916
[Madame] It's been so long.

58:15.583 --> 58:16.791
I called the number,

58:16.875 --> 58:19.083
all it gave me was an address
and then, it hung up.

58:19.166 --> 58:21.750
Oh, that's how we keep The Academy safe.

58:22.375 --> 58:23.583
What is this place?

58:23.666 --> 58:24.666
Is it, uh...

58:25.083 --> 58:26.333
-Whor--
-Whorehouse?

58:26.458 --> 58:28.708
[both laugh]

58:31.166 --> 58:32.583
It's a private club.

58:33.291 --> 58:37.125
Well, I entertain for your father
long enough to understand that,

58:37.208 --> 58:39.875
powerful men want a place
where they can be themselves...

58:40.833 --> 58:44.000
away from the world,
and The Academy provides that.

58:44.083 --> 58:46.666
Well, it kind of sounds like a whorehouse.

58:46.750 --> 58:48.416
[laughs]

58:48.500 --> 58:51.916
Well, men just want to be listened to.

58:52.000 --> 58:55.083
You'll be amazed at the secrets
they spill here.

58:55.666 --> 59:00.208
For example, it was here
that I learned your father had passed on.

59:01.166 --> 59:03.833
In spite of everything, I'm sorry.

59:05.416 --> 59:07.708
I loved him once upon a time.

59:07.916 --> 59:09.625
He was married to my mother.

59:09.875 --> 59:13.250
So you understand why he fell for me.

59:13.333 --> 59:16.958
[both laugh]

59:18.500 --> 59:20.583
I was so glad you could come,
I didn't think you would.

59:20.666 --> 59:23.541
I gave you my word.
Anything you want, it's yours.

59:24.083 --> 59:25.583
Hmm.
[clicks tongue]

59:27.333 --> 59:30.166
A friend told me
that your father left the bank

59:30.250 --> 59:31.916
to you and your brother?

59:34.791 --> 59:36.750
Your father had three children.

59:38.250 --> 59:40.125
It should have been divided equally.

59:42.333 --> 59:44.041
Charity is dead, Aunty Enitan.

59:44.125 --> 59:47.333
And I am her only living relative.

59:47.750 --> 59:49.708
I should be her beneficiary

59:51.958 --> 59:53.208
[sighs]

59:53.791 --> 59:55.416
I'd give you my shares in a second,

59:55.500 --> 59:59.041
-but my mom has the highest shares.
-I know the structure.

59:59.125 --> 1:00:01.625
And I can't sell without her permission.

1:00:01.708 --> 1:00:03.250
[Madame] I know the structure.

1:00:03.833 --> 1:00:05.958
What I'm saying to you is this.

1:00:06.875 --> 1:00:07.958
One day,

1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:13.083
I will come to you
to help me get goals shares,

1:00:13.166 --> 1:00:14.791
and you will do so.

1:00:18.166 --> 1:00:19.541
Is that fair?

1:00:21.916 --> 1:00:24.041
[gloomy music]

1:01:00.416 --> 1:01:02.083
Yes, hello, can I help you?

1:01:02.166 --> 1:01:03.500
[deliveryman] Yeah. This is for you.

1:01:06.541 --> 1:01:08.083
Okay. Thank you.

1:01:23.916 --> 1:01:26.041
[gloomy music]

1:01:32.125 --> 1:01:34.458
[Motunrayo]
<i>You want me to set up my brother.</i>

1:01:35.125 --> 1:01:36.708
Only for a short time.

1:01:37.208 --> 1:01:40.416
As long as this project takes to,
you know it's just a short time.

1:01:40.500 --> 1:01:41.458
No.

1:01:41.541 --> 1:01:43.458
I can't do it, I won't do it.

1:01:44.333 --> 1:01:47.125
"I owe you more than I can ever repay you.

1:01:47.750 --> 1:01:51.208
If you ever need anything from me,
it is yours without question."

1:01:51.291 --> 1:01:53.000
Your words, not mine.

1:01:55.416 --> 1:01:56.541
[sighs]

1:02:00.458 --> 1:02:01.875
What do you need me to do?

1:02:02.541 --> 1:02:04.083
[knocking on door]

1:02:04.166 --> 1:02:06.375
-[door creaks]
-[Motunrayo groans]

1:02:07.083 --> 1:02:08.375
[Motunrayo] Can I help you?

1:02:11.541 --> 1:02:13.833
Uh, are you crazy?

1:02:15.166 --> 1:02:17.208
My name is Grace, I work with Madame.

1:02:26.833 --> 1:02:27.875
What do you want?

1:02:27.958 --> 1:02:29.208
To prepare you.

1:02:30.375 --> 1:02:31.958
Prepare me for what?

1:02:33.083 --> 1:02:36.541
To convince Chike that you're the target
of a love triangle operation

1:02:36.625 --> 1:02:38.041
with Mr. Edem Bucknur.

1:02:38.125 --> 1:02:40.000
[snickers, sighs]

1:02:40.708 --> 1:02:42.416
Uncle Edem and I?

1:02:42.916 --> 1:02:46.291
That is so absurd,
no one is going to believe that.

1:02:46.833 --> 1:02:48.791
Chike is Madame's most skilled operative

1:02:48.875 --> 1:02:51.666
and if you do not prepare well,
everything is going to fall apart.

1:02:56.666 --> 1:02:58.125
How long do I have?

1:02:58.208 --> 1:02:59.291
[Grace] <i>One month.</i>

1:03:00.041 --> 1:03:01.291
What are you doing here?

1:03:05.250 --> 1:03:06.375
[sighs]

1:03:07.750 --> 1:03:09.583
It is good to see you too, Toyin.

1:03:10.250 --> 1:03:14.000
What are you doing here?

1:03:15.875 --> 1:03:17.708
I came to pay my respects.

1:03:20.250 --> 1:03:21.791
You are not welcome here.

1:03:23.208 --> 1:03:24.333
Leave.

1:03:26.083 --> 1:03:28.500
Toyin, it doesn't always have to...

1:03:29.250 --> 1:03:31.208
Would you rather I call security?

1:03:35.666 --> 1:03:37.875
[tense music]

1:03:46.583 --> 1:03:48.708
What is wrong with you?

1:03:49.166 --> 1:03:50.583
What did I do?

1:03:50.875 --> 1:03:52.416
He came up to me.

1:03:52.708 --> 1:03:53.833
What was I supposed to do?

1:03:53.916 --> 1:03:55.208
Turn and walk away?

1:03:55.541 --> 1:03:56.500
Yes.

1:03:57.500 --> 1:03:58.583
Mom?

1:03:59.166 --> 1:04:00.208
[sighs]

1:04:11.041 --> 1:04:12.708
[Motunrayo] <i>Can I ask you a question?</i>

1:04:13.875 --> 1:04:17.708
Your face changes
whenever Chike's name comes up.

1:04:18.125 --> 1:04:19.375
What's up with that?

1:04:19.625 --> 1:04:20.541
Mm.

1:04:20.958 --> 1:04:23.416
You are getting really good at this.

1:04:23.500 --> 1:04:25.416
I have a good teacher. Mm?

1:04:25.500 --> 1:04:26.958
[chuckles]

1:04:27.708 --> 1:04:29.125
Don't drink too much.

1:04:29.208 --> 1:04:30.708
Tomorrow is a very big day.

1:04:33.041 --> 1:04:34.833
[Motunrayo] <i>I've ordered the drinks.</i>

1:04:35.541 --> 1:04:38.125
<i>Oh, god, I'm so nervous.</i>

1:04:38.208 --> 1:04:40.416
I never thought I'll be this nervous.

1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:44.500
You're going to be fine.
Remember, just play yourself.

1:04:44.666 --> 1:04:46.458
I would never do this.

1:04:46.833 --> 1:04:48.958
Oh, yes, but she doesn't know that.

1:04:49.583 --> 1:04:50.666
Have fun.

1:04:51.541 --> 1:04:53.083
[sighs deeply]
Okay.

1:04:53.166 --> 1:04:55.208
[pants]

1:04:55.291 --> 1:04:57.500
Have fun.
[sighs sharply]

1:05:02.541 --> 1:05:05.041
[tense music]

1:05:08.833 --> 1:05:10.500
[Chike] Good evening, ma.

1:05:10.583 --> 1:05:11.791
Should I open it?

1:05:12.208 --> 1:05:13.375
Sure, open it.

1:05:16.875 --> 1:05:19.166
[foreboding music]

1:05:21.875 --> 1:05:23.958
-Do you know who you are talking about?
-I don't care.

1:05:24.041 --> 1:05:25.291
Excuse me.

1:05:25.375 --> 1:05:27.208
Officer, what seems to be the problem?

1:05:27.291 --> 1:05:28.916
What's the fuck is wrong with my phone?

1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:33.416
[indistinct chatter]

1:05:38.958 --> 1:05:40.083
[Chike] Are you okay?

1:05:43.541 --> 1:05:44.791
[Motunrayo] You.

1:05:45.541 --> 1:05:46.916
[Motunrayo laughs]

1:05:47.666 --> 1:05:49.541
Can I borrow your phone?

1:05:54.833 --> 1:05:56.416
[Chike] <i>Oh, I can't believe
that this guy...</i>

1:05:56.500 --> 1:05:58.541
-[dog barking]
-...locked my house.

1:05:58.791 --> 1:06:00.458
I can't believe
that this guy locked my house.

1:06:00.541 --> 1:06:02.333
God help me punish Mr. Edem.

1:06:02.416 --> 1:06:03.708
God will punish him.

1:06:06.750 --> 1:06:07.916
[Chike] Do you know them?

1:06:09.666 --> 1:06:13.583
That's my dad, Edem, and Aunt Enitan.

1:06:13.666 --> 1:06:15.041
My dad's former PA.

1:06:15.125 --> 1:06:18.708

1:06:19.791 --> 1:06:21.916
[foreboding music]

1:06:28.958 --> 1:06:30.500
-[Chike] Uh-uh.
-Okay, so.

1:06:30.583 --> 1:06:32.208
[Chike] No, but we had a deal, no, like,

1:06:32.291 --> 1:06:34.333
you pay my rent and I take you home.

1:06:34.750 --> 1:06:36.583
But my car is already here.

1:06:36.666 --> 1:06:37.750
[chuckles]

1:06:38.833 --> 1:06:40.000
[relieved sigh]

1:06:44.875 --> 1:06:46.416
[Motunrayo] <i>Thanks for the ride.</i>

1:06:47.083 --> 1:06:48.333
<i>No wahala.</i>

1:06:49.875 --> 1:06:50.833
[sighs]

1:06:51.375 --> 1:06:52.791
You know I love you, right?

1:06:54.041 --> 1:06:56.291
I love how you're always there for me.

1:06:59.250 --> 1:07:00.333
[sighs]

1:07:01.125 --> 1:07:03.125
I will... see you around.

1:07:03.500 --> 1:07:04.833
Take care of yourself, huh?

1:07:04.916 --> 1:07:06.000
I will.

1:07:07.500 --> 1:07:10.416

[knocking continues]

1:07:35.666 --> 1:07:37.458
[Motunrayo] Hold on a second.

1:07:43.125 --> 1:07:44.291
What's wrong?

1:07:44.375 --> 1:07:45.916
[Grace] We didn't get what we needed.

1:07:46.416 --> 1:07:47.791
What do you mean?

1:07:47.875 --> 1:07:51.291
We couldn't get an isolated picture of him
and her alone by the car.

1:07:51.375 --> 1:07:52.541
Damn it.

1:07:53.375 --> 1:07:54.500
[sighs]

1:07:55.583 --> 1:07:58.208
Wait a minute, why are you here?

1:07:58.291 --> 1:07:59.750
[Grace] We would need to try again.

1:08:00.666 --> 1:08:01.625
What?

1:08:01.708 --> 1:08:02.791
How?

1:08:02.875 --> 1:08:04.791
I want to talk about Uncle Edem.

1:08:05.916 --> 1:08:08.458
I'm meeting him tonight, so...

1:08:09.041 --> 1:08:10.208
are you coming?

1:08:11.750 --> 1:08:13.458
All right, let me just quickly
use the bathroom,

1:08:13.541 --> 1:08:14.833
and then when I'm back, we'll go.

1:08:14.916 --> 1:08:15.916
-All right?
-Okay.

1:08:17.916 --> 1:08:19.500
Hey, what's going on?

1:08:22.041 --> 1:08:23.916
[Grace] <i>We're getting the picture.
Hold on.</i>

1:08:26.833 --> 1:08:29.166
<i>That's it. You can come out now.</i>

1:08:33.666 --> 1:08:35.166
<i>Did you hear me? We are on again.</i>

1:08:35.250 --> 1:08:37.125
Yes, yes, I heard you.

1:08:37.583 --> 1:08:38.750
I heard you.

1:08:46.708 --> 1:08:47.791
[sighs sharply]

1:09:01.791 --> 1:09:03.916
[Kelly] Thank you for meeting me
on such short notice.

1:09:08.333 --> 1:09:10.875
[gloomy music]

1:09:25.791 --> 1:09:27.041
You were right.

1:09:27.875 --> 1:09:29.541
She gave me the shares.

1:09:29.625 --> 1:09:32.291
So I'll see you tonight?

1:09:36.250 --> 1:09:37.625
[sighs]

1:09:41.625 --> 1:09:43.083
[door squeaks]

1:09:43.166 --> 1:09:45.750
Mommy, you need to come with me, now.

1:09:46.500 --> 1:09:47.833
Come with you where?

1:09:50.458 --> 1:09:52.708
Motunrayo, what are you talking about?

1:09:54.041 --> 1:09:55.541
It's past ten.

1:09:56.041 --> 1:09:58.375
Mommy, we can save Bamidele.

1:09:58.458 --> 1:09:59.833
[Madame] <i>Welcome, Toyin.</i>

1:10:12.083 --> 1:10:13.291
What do you want?

1:10:13.375 --> 1:10:15.541
Are you sure you don't want to sit?

1:10:16.708 --> 1:10:18.833
Or should I pat you down for weapons?

1:10:19.583 --> 1:10:22.083
After all, you said you will kill me.

1:10:22.166 --> 1:10:23.500
Last time we met.

1:10:23.583 --> 1:10:27.416
Is this supposed to be revenge
for Charity?

1:10:27.500 --> 1:10:29.416
Don't you dare speak her name.

1:10:29.500 --> 1:10:31.166
The name that I gave her.

1:10:32.375 --> 1:10:34.375
She called me Mommy.

1:10:34.958 --> 1:10:39.125
And she jumped up for joy
anytime I entered the room.

1:10:39.208 --> 1:10:41.750
She is dead because of you.

1:10:41.833 --> 1:10:44.416
Oh, and that is how you justify...

1:10:45.041 --> 1:10:46.541
whatever this is.

1:10:52.875 --> 1:10:54.541
Is that what she told you?

1:10:55.250 --> 1:10:57.666
That you have to make amends for Charity.

1:11:01.500 --> 1:11:03.750
Darling, it was an accident.

1:11:10.458 --> 1:11:11.458
Wow.

1:11:13.708 --> 1:11:17.416
That's the first time
you've ever said those words to me.

1:11:18.208 --> 1:11:20.208
[Madame] Agent Spencer is a friend.

1:11:22.625 --> 1:11:26.791
I may be able to convince her
to charge Chike Ekeh

1:11:27.541 --> 1:11:29.708
for her other crimes...

1:11:30.791 --> 1:11:33.041
and leave out the recent escapades.

1:11:33.125 --> 1:11:35.166
Motunrayo, you agreed to this...

1:11:36.250 --> 1:11:39.416
to have your brother labeled
a drug dealer?

1:11:39.500 --> 1:11:41.250
He doesn't have to be.

1:11:42.291 --> 1:11:46.500
All we have to do
is hand over 33 percent of Daraja

1:11:46.916 --> 1:11:49.541
which is what Charity
would have inherited anyway.

1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:54.458
Is that true, Enitan?

1:11:57.208 --> 1:12:01.583
Will 33 percent make the charges go away?

1:12:01.666 --> 1:12:05.083
[laughing]

1:12:08.166 --> 1:12:10.333
I have always loved you...

1:12:12.083 --> 1:12:13.208
Toyin.

1:12:13.750 --> 1:12:18.708
You have always seen the big picture.

1:12:19.125 --> 1:12:20.708
[laughs]

1:12:21.083 --> 1:12:22.125
What?

1:12:23.208 --> 1:12:24.708
What are you talking about?

1:12:24.791 --> 1:12:27.083
You will hand over your golden share.

1:12:27.833 --> 1:12:31.208
And you, 75 percent of Daraja.

1:12:31.958 --> 1:12:32.875
What?

1:12:33.291 --> 1:12:35.666
We had a deal.
You're only supposed to take a third!

1:12:35.750 --> 1:12:36.750
What are you doing?

1:12:36.833 --> 1:12:38.125
Silly girl.

1:12:39.791 --> 1:12:43.166
Did you actually think
that this was an attempt at restitution?

1:12:44.791 --> 1:12:47.083
Mommy, we don't have to agree to this.

1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:49.250
We can fight this.

1:12:49.333 --> 1:12:50.291
Oh.

1:12:51.416 --> 1:12:55.208
And you think that we can leave here
without agreeing to this?

1:12:56.750 --> 1:12:58.916
Actually, I have a number of...

1:12:59.625 --> 1:13:03.416
strapping young men
who will make life very hard for you.

1:13:04.375 --> 1:13:08.583
And I'm sure you wouldn't want me
to resort to that, would you?

1:13:09.541 --> 1:13:10.416
[Madame] Hm?

1:13:10.500 --> 1:13:14.958
[laughing]

1:13:16.541 --> 1:13:19.125
I'm sorry. I, I didn't know.

1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:26.125
We have a deal.

1:13:26.208 --> 1:13:28.750
[gloomy music]

1:13:56.958 --> 1:13:58.125
[Motunrayo] Mom?

1:13:58.666 --> 1:14:00.333
Let me explain.

1:14:04.041 --> 1:14:05.250
Motunrayo.

1:14:07.041 --> 1:14:09.250
You destroyed your family.

1:14:10.416 --> 1:14:11.833
For a woman...

1:14:12.916 --> 1:14:14.250
for a whore...

1:14:14.583 --> 1:14:16.750
who tried to destroy my marriage.

1:14:17.375 --> 1:14:19.250
Mommy, it wasn't like that.

1:14:19.833 --> 1:14:22.291
I only wanted
to make it right for Charity.

1:14:22.375 --> 1:14:23.416
Yes.

1:14:23.958 --> 1:14:26.875
And you ended up destroying us.

1:14:28.666 --> 1:14:31.875
It would have been better if you had died

1:14:31.958 --> 1:14:33.583
instead of her.

1:14:35.583 --> 1:14:39.041
Mom, I will do whatever it takes
to make it right.

1:14:39.708 --> 1:14:41.000
[Motunrayo] I promise.

1:14:52.083 --> 1:14:53.250

[ominous music]

1:16:11.416 --> 1:16:12.375
Hello?

1:16:13.500 --> 1:16:14.625
We have a problem.

1:16:15.500 --> 1:16:17.166
Isn't that always the case?

1:16:20.416 --> 1:16:21.416
Mm-hm.

1:16:28.083 --> 1:16:29.041
Okay.

1:16:32.125 --> 1:16:33.500
[water pattering]

1:16:37.333 --> 1:16:40.750
Whatever, the size, he'll pay.

1:16:40.833 --> 1:16:41.958
-[Chike] Oh.
-[Grace] Yes.

1:16:42.041 --> 1:16:43.791
He is blowing the whistle on Megapharma.

1:16:43.875 --> 1:16:46.708
[Chike] Okay. Good.
Madame wants to see you.

1:16:46.791 --> 1:16:48.041
[Madame] Report.

1:16:50.416 --> 1:16:53.083
I said report.

1:16:53.458 --> 1:16:56.416
Pastor Dimeji is ready
to turn on Megapharma.

1:16:56.500 --> 1:16:58.125
He'll be sending an e-mail tonight.

1:17:00.166 --> 1:17:02.083
I knew you'd be successful.

1:17:02.666 --> 1:17:06.083
That's why I went ahead
to set up a meeting with Megapharma.

1:17:06.166 --> 1:17:07.291
I don't quite understand.

1:17:07.375 --> 1:17:10.125
Oh, you see,
to be a successful rat-catcher,

1:17:10.625 --> 1:17:13.291
you need to breed rats.

1:17:13.791 --> 1:17:14.791
Of course.

1:17:14.875 --> 1:17:17.583
You and Chike need to come up with a plan

1:17:17.666 --> 1:17:19.166
to keep the Pastor quiet,

1:17:19.500 --> 1:17:24.166
whilst I consider how much I'm going to
charge Megapharma for the privilege.

1:17:26.125 --> 1:17:27.375
[Madame] That's not all.

1:17:29.041 --> 1:17:33.125
The first folder contains all you need
to know about Bamidele Elesho.

1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:38.875
We need to establish a relationship
between him and Blue Stream.

1:17:38.958 --> 1:17:43.541
The second folder contains a signed
profile from the US government,

1:17:43.625 --> 1:17:46.375
granting you immunity
for all your drug crimes.

1:17:47.583 --> 1:17:48.791
[stuttering]

1:17:49.083 --> 1:17:50.791
Why are you offering me this?

1:17:50.875 --> 1:17:53.500
Chike will take the fall with Bamidele.

1:17:53.583 --> 1:17:55.416
No, Chike is my sister.

1:17:55.500 --> 1:17:56.541
I will never betray her.

1:17:56.625 --> 1:17:59.833
Never betray her
even if it means saving yourself?

1:17:59.916 --> 1:18:00.833
No!

1:18:01.083 --> 1:18:02.791
What about saving your mother?

1:18:04.750 --> 1:18:06.500
She received the money you sent her.

1:18:07.250 --> 1:18:09.625
[Kelly] Which makes her an accessory
after the fact.

1:18:10.500 --> 1:18:12.208
That's ten years in prison.

1:18:12.708 --> 1:18:14.500
[Madame] Oh, by the way,
this is Agent Spencer.

1:18:14.583 --> 1:18:17.416
She works with the United States
Drugs Agency.

1:18:17.958 --> 1:18:19.875
[Madame] Chike is going down.

1:18:19.958 --> 1:18:21.166
Question is...

1:18:21.500 --> 1:18:23.916
whether you choose to go with her.

1:18:29.041 --> 1:18:31.083
-[Dimeji] I can't get enough of you.
-[Grace screams]

1:18:31.166 --> 1:18:32.750
[Grace] Yes, Daddy.
[laughs]

1:18:32.833 --> 1:18:33.750
[Grace] Wow.

1:18:33.833 --> 1:18:35.666
Thou art in such a hurry.

1:18:35.750 --> 1:18:36.708
[Dimeji] Yes, I am.

1:18:36.791 --> 1:18:38.166
[Grace] Welcome, baby.

1:18:38.250 --> 1:18:39.333
[Dimeji and Grace laugh]

1:18:41.708 --> 1:18:42.875
Hmm...

1:18:43.583 --> 1:18:44.916
[Grace] Ah.

1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:46.375
[Dimeji] So where were we?

1:18:47.458 --> 1:18:48.583
[Dimeji exhales sharply]

1:18:48.666 --> 1:18:49.625
[smooches]

1:18:51.041 --> 1:18:52.041
[Chike] Okay.

1:18:52.666 --> 1:18:53.916
Jesus!

1:18:54.375 --> 1:18:56.041
-I think I've seen enough.
-[Grace chuckles]

1:18:59.458 --> 1:19:01.291
Who are you, and what...
what are you doing in my--

1:19:01.375 --> 1:19:02.541
In your room?

1:19:03.666 --> 1:19:06.333
Well, Pastor Dimeji, I'm your friend.

1:19:07.708 --> 1:19:09.375
[Chike] Isn't that right, Tayo?

1:19:09.458 --> 1:19:10.708
Yes, it is.

1:19:15.625 --> 1:19:17.291
[stutters]
Why are we...

1:19:17.375 --> 1:19:18.375
[sighs]

1:19:18.458 --> 1:19:19.791
Why are we letting this happen?

1:19:20.416 --> 1:19:21.916
Okay, what would you have me do?

1:19:24.375 --> 1:19:26.708
Chike, we can run away, we can go.

1:19:26.791 --> 1:19:28.458
With all Madame knows about us?

1:19:28.750 --> 1:19:31.541
Do you want to spend the rest of your life
running from the NDLEA?

1:19:33.250 --> 1:19:34.875
What about what we know about her?

1:19:35.291 --> 1:19:36.916
We can bring her down.

1:19:39.458 --> 1:19:42.375
Come on, Chike,
is this the life you want to live?

1:19:42.458 --> 1:19:43.708
Grace, I get it.

1:19:43.791 --> 1:19:45.833
You like Pastor Dimeji,
you like these children,

1:19:45.916 --> 1:19:47.791
and what's happening to them is a tragedy.

1:19:47.875 --> 1:19:49.458
But, Grace, this isn't our fight.

1:19:49.541 --> 1:19:51.083
We could make it our fight.

1:19:54.166 --> 1:19:55.416
You called.

1:19:56.041 --> 1:19:58.750
Now, do you have anything on the Enitan
that worked for Daraja?

1:20:01.916 --> 1:20:03.125
Thank you.

1:20:06.625 --> 1:20:08.708
[gloomy music]

1:20:11.541 --> 1:20:12.958
Thank you for coming

1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:15.625
-[Grace] Dimeji--
-What do you want?

1:20:16.208 --> 1:20:17.625
I'm sorry.

1:20:17.708 --> 1:20:20.250
Don't you dare apologize.

1:20:21.833 --> 1:20:23.625
You approached me.

1:20:26.541 --> 1:20:29.666
You convinced me to spill the beans
on Megapharma,

1:20:29.750 --> 1:20:32.375
and then you blackmail me into silence.

1:20:33.250 --> 1:20:35.625
-I'm sorry about everything.
-[Dimeji] No!

1:20:35.708 --> 1:20:37.125
You don't get to do this.

1:20:38.583 --> 1:20:42.041
You don't get to destroy my life,
and then do this.

1:20:42.125 --> 1:20:43.125
No.

1:20:43.625 --> 1:20:44.958
What kind of person are you?

1:20:45.041 --> 1:20:46.666
Somebody who loves you.

1:20:47.083 --> 1:20:50.500
Dimeji, somebody who is here
to find out if there's still ever

1:20:50.583 --> 1:20:52.583
any chance for us, please.

1:21:03.583 --> 1:21:04.875
Go to hell.

1:21:12.666 --> 1:21:13.708

1:21:14.875 --> 1:21:16.458
Took you long enough.

1:21:16.541 --> 1:21:18.083
[Grace] I told you I was busy.

1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:23.333
Edem is not being straightforward with us.

1:21:23.791 --> 1:21:25.333
We need to find out what's going on.

1:21:25.416 --> 1:21:27.041
[Grace] Who cares what's going on?

1:21:29.166 --> 1:21:32.291
He's just a broke playboy
who wants to stay on the gravy train.

1:21:32.958 --> 1:21:36.791
Besides, I'm really confused
as to why you're concerned with that.

1:21:36.875 --> 1:21:40.166
Rather than being concerned with actual
children who are being poisoned

1:21:40.250 --> 1:21:42.375
-by a pharmaceutical company.
-Jesus!

1:21:42.458 --> 1:21:44.000
Why does this bother you so much?

1:21:44.083 --> 1:21:45.958
Why does it not bother you at all?

1:21:46.208 --> 1:21:47.166
Chike.

1:21:48.166 --> 1:21:49.416
In my research,

1:21:49.666 --> 1:21:53.500
I found out that the Eleshos once had
a three-year-old daughter who had died.

1:21:53.708 --> 1:21:54.833
I didn't think anything of it,

1:21:54.916 --> 1:21:58.166
until one of my clients and contacts
sent me this picture.

1:22:04.708 --> 1:22:05.708
Yeah, but--

for drug crimes.</i>

1:23:00.791 --> 1:23:03.333
<i>I've been trying to figure out
a way to get you out,</i>

1:23:03.416 --> 1:23:05.625
<i>but they've been watching me like a hawk.</i>

1:23:06.083 --> 1:23:07.541
<i>They pull the trigger tomorrow.</i>

1:23:07.625 --> 1:23:09.250
<i>We're out of options.</i>

1:23:09.750 --> 1:23:12.416

I'm telling you this so you can run.</i>

[Kelly] <i>We need to see.</i>

1:24:24.875 --> 1:24:28.583
<i>Go to Madame. Tell her that you need to go
over tomorrows plans with her and Mide,</i>

1:24:28.666 --> 1:24:30.416
<i>to ensure nothing goes wrong.</i>

1:24:30.500 --> 1:24:32.083
<i>Once he leaves, I'll leave.</i>

1:24:32.458 --> 1:24:34.666
<i>Once you are done with that
come meet me at the spot.</i>

1:24:34.958 --> 1:24:36.375
<i>Make sure you are not followed.</i>

1:24:37.500 --> 1:24:39.291

1:24:47.291 --> 1:24:49.458
[gloomy music]

1:25:00.958 --> 1:25:02.541
Sorry, it took this long.

1:25:03.250 --> 1:25:05.875
Madame has been obsessively
preparing for tomorrow.

1:25:06.166 --> 1:25:07.583
How could you not tell me?

1:25:07.875 --> 1:25:11.000
Chike, I couldn't tell you
and then risk you blowing it.

1:25:11.458 --> 1:25:13.416
I spent the last three months
looking for how--

1:25:13.500 --> 1:25:15.500
And the best you could come up with
was run away?

1:25:16.041 --> 1:25:17.958
It's either that,
or you spend 20 years in jail

1:25:18.041 --> 1:25:20.416
-for drug crime...
-So what happens to you if I run?

1:25:20.500 --> 1:25:22.041
It'll be my turn to save you.

1:25:22.500 --> 1:25:24.958
Lucky me, but, no.

1:25:25.916 --> 1:25:26.958
No.

1:25:28.750 --> 1:25:30.125
So, what do we do?

1:25:31.041 --> 1:25:34.416
Madame will expect you
to confront her tomorrow about her child.

1:25:34.791 --> 1:25:37.125
And then Kelly is supposed
to come in and make an arrest.

1:25:37.208 --> 1:25:40.166
And if I run, they will know
that you tipped me off.

1:25:40.250 --> 1:25:41.291
[Grace] Yes.

1:25:44.375 --> 1:25:46.541
There is only one thing we can do.

1:25:47.875 --> 1:25:50.916
[Bamidele] Why wouldn't I just
confront Motunrayo and stop this?

1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:53.166
Because Madame will try again.

1:25:53.458 --> 1:25:56.041
It's better to let the plan go ahead
then counter it.

1:25:57.041 --> 1:25:57.875
[sighs]

1:25:57.958 --> 1:26:00.333
Are you sure this is not just a plan
for you to get away?

1:26:01.500 --> 1:26:03.083
The US is arresting me.

1:26:03.875 --> 1:26:07.041
The question you have to answer
is whether Madame goes down with me.

1:26:09.250 --> 1:26:11.458
[gloomy music]

1:26:13.583 --> 1:26:16.291
Did you not read the terms
of your immunity deal?

1:26:16.791 --> 1:26:19.291
We want to know what it will take
to change that deal.

1:26:22.458 --> 1:26:24.666
Grace, Grace, run, run! It's a trap.

1:26:25.541 --> 1:26:27.916
-It's a trap.
-Grace doesn't need to run.

1:26:28.708 --> 1:26:29.541
Grace?

1:26:29.625 --> 1:26:30.458
Yes, Madame.

1:26:30.541 --> 1:26:33.833
Hand the original surveillance footage
to Agent Spencer.

1:26:36.500 --> 1:26:37.833
You bitch.

1:26:38.250 --> 1:26:39.791
They were going to send
my mother to prison

1:26:39.875 --> 1:26:41.250
because of the money I sent to her.

1:26:41.333 --> 1:26:43.291
My fault, but I couldn't let that happen.

1:26:43.375 --> 1:26:45.041
You chose your mother over me?

1:26:48.041 --> 1:26:49.083

1:27:15.375 --> 1:27:16.375
What?

1:27:17.458 --> 1:27:20.250
Oh, no, you're lying. No, you're lying.

1:27:20.458 --> 1:27:21.500
No!

1:27:22.708 --> 1:27:25.333
You, can you see that?

1:27:25.416 --> 1:27:26.875
This is all your fault!

1:27:26.958 --> 1:27:29.458
This is... This is all your fault!

1:27:30.250 --> 1:27:32.208
-This is all your fault!
-I know you're upset.

1:27:32.291 --> 1:27:34.416
You know... You know I'm upset. You...

1:27:34.875 --> 1:27:35.833
Fuck you!

1:27:35.916 --> 1:27:39.125
[speaking Yoruba]

1:27:39.208 --> 1:27:40.583
[in English]
But... but we can fix it.

1:27:40.875 --> 1:27:43.125
-So we can still fix it.
-We can fix...

1:27:43.208 --> 1:27:44.041
She's dead!

1:27:44.125 --> 1:27:45.750
Can you hear yourself? You can fix what?

1:27:46.625 --> 1:27:47.750
Leave me alone.

1:27:53.250 --> 1:27:54.291
[door closes]

1:27:56.333 --> 1:27:57.416
[sighs]

1:27:59.041 --> 1:28:00.500
[Chike] Grace, you need to calm him down.

1:28:00.583 --> 1:28:03.333
We need him on our side
to figure this thing out.

1:28:03.875 --> 1:28:06.333
Another impossible task coming up.

1:28:07.125 --> 1:28:10.833
Well, it looks like our deal is off
because you just lost your star witness.

1:28:10.916 --> 1:28:11.958
Wait.

1:28:12.041 --> 1:28:14.208
Our flight is at 6:00 a.m., right?

1:28:14.708 --> 1:28:15.750
[sighs]

1:28:15.833 --> 1:28:17.500
So I still have four hours.

1:28:19.375 --> 1:28:20.916
Or I could take you in.

1:28:22.166 --> 1:28:23.958
But maybe, our flight was now.

1:28:26.333 --> 1:28:29.125
Listen, I'm not going to stop you
at your chance of revenge, okay?

1:28:29.208 --> 1:28:31.750
But just know that the clock is ticking.

1:28:32.416 --> 1:28:33.458
Tick-tock.

1:28:43.625 --> 1:28:44.583
[sighs]

[ominous music]

1:28:57.458 --> 1:28:59.750
[upbeat music playing]

1:29:08.166 --> 1:29:09.125
[Chike] Enitan.

1:29:09.958 --> 1:29:11.041
Enitan!

1:29:11.458 --> 1:29:14.083
You better get your green-eyed ass
down here now!

1:29:15.583 --> 1:29:17.750
The Americans are laxer than I thought.

1:29:17.833 --> 1:29:19.291
[Chike] I didn't escape.

1:29:19.833 --> 1:29:22.750
The Americans want me,
but I convinced them to take you too.

1:29:23.125 --> 1:29:26.708
Oh, and congratulations,
you got your revenge.

1:29:26.791 --> 1:29:28.083
Motunrayo is dead.

1:29:28.166 --> 1:29:29.250
[Edem] You're lying.

1:29:29.333 --> 1:29:31.000
[Chike] Is that guilt I hear?

1:29:31.708 --> 1:29:32.916
You should have thought about that

1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:35.000
before you got her
to betray her entire family

1:29:35.083 --> 1:29:36.583
for Madame's game.

1:29:36.666 --> 1:29:38.833
-She's lying.
-[Edem] Uh-uh. Obviously.

1:29:38.916 --> 1:29:40.416
You know, that day,

1:29:40.958 --> 1:29:42.250
in your house,

1:29:43.333 --> 1:29:44.958
I thought you were being real.

1:29:45.041 --> 1:29:46.375
[snickers]

1:29:47.416 --> 1:29:49.875
You were just telling her a sob story
so that she'll believe you.

1:29:49.958 --> 1:29:51.500
-Shut up!
-[Chike] And for what?

1:29:51.583 --> 1:29:53.458
So that Madame can own shares?

1:29:53.541 --> 1:29:55.583
Why are you trying to divide us?

1:29:56.125 --> 1:29:57.250
I have the golden share,

1:29:57.333 --> 1:29:59.833
and the plan has always been for Edem
to have some of my shares.

1:29:59.916 --> 1:30:00.875
[laughs]

1:30:01.041 --> 1:30:02.333
Point of correction.

1:30:02.875 --> 1:30:05.458
You think you have the golden share.

1:30:09.708 --> 1:30:11.916
[tense music]

1:30:21.125 --> 1:30:23.500
[tense music continues]

1:30:26.666 --> 1:30:27.916
[Edem] We have a problem.

1:30:28.291 --> 1:30:29.666
Chike has the golden share.

1:30:29.750 --> 1:30:31.333
The transaction is invalid.

1:30:31.958 --> 1:30:33.458
Are the agreements ready?

1:30:33.666 --> 1:30:34.875
Yes, Madame.

1:30:34.958 --> 1:30:37.125
They will all be ready
for the arrival of the elections.

1:30:39.583 --> 1:30:41.833
Get me that crazy girl!

1:30:54.416 --> 1:30:55.458
You...

1:30:56.083 --> 1:30:58.625
will sign the golden shares to me.

1:31:00.250 --> 1:31:01.375
Why would I?

1:31:01.458 --> 1:31:02.333
[thwacks]

1:31:03.416 --> 1:31:04.333
Huh.

1:31:06.875 --> 1:31:08.375
You still don't get it, do you?

1:31:09.833 --> 1:31:11.458
You could break me if you had time,

1:31:11.541 --> 1:31:13.125
but when Agent Spencer dropped me off,

1:31:13.208 --> 1:31:15.083
she gave me 30 minutes.

1:31:16.041 --> 1:31:18.958
Now I'm betting that I could hold off
for the remaining five minutes or so.

1:31:20.791 --> 1:31:23.416
That's a bet I'm willing to take.

1:31:23.666 --> 1:31:25.916
Wait. Just one second.

1:31:29.125 --> 1:31:30.750
This doesn't make sense.

1:31:32.708 --> 1:31:33.958
Why did you come back?

1:31:34.041 --> 1:31:35.416
I came back for you.

1:31:38.041 --> 1:31:40.541
Madame's share transfers are invalid.

1:31:40.625 --> 1:31:41.625
Hmm.

1:31:41.708 --> 1:31:43.666
Motunrayo still has all the shares.

1:31:44.583 --> 1:31:45.750
But she's dead.

1:31:46.291 --> 1:31:48.333
And Bamidele is her next of kin.

1:31:49.958 --> 1:31:53.125
Now he wants revenge on the woman
that killed his sister.

1:31:54.333 --> 1:31:56.708
He is willing to offer you
20 percent of Daraja

1:31:56.791 --> 1:31:59.375
if you confess your part in the scam
to the US government.

1:32:00.416 --> 1:32:01.916
You get immunity...

1:32:03.000 --> 1:32:04.541
and she goes to jail.

1:32:05.625 --> 1:32:06.583
You're lying.

1:32:06.666 --> 1:32:07.708
Check my purse.

1:32:08.041 --> 1:32:09.041
[snickers]

1:32:09.375 --> 1:32:10.541
Edem.

1:32:11.541 --> 1:32:13.208
There are two documents.

1:32:14.708 --> 1:32:16.500
A share transfer form...

1:32:17.166 --> 1:32:20.000
and an offer of immunity
from the US government.

1:32:23.541 --> 1:32:24.708
Edem!

1:32:25.416 --> 1:32:27.583
Well, they're signed.

1:32:28.125 --> 1:32:30.000
So, why do I need you?

1:32:30.083 --> 1:32:31.125
You don't.

1:32:33.125 --> 1:32:35.416
But how does Madame know
that you are not going to turn on her?

1:32:35.500 --> 1:32:36.416
[Madame] Edem.

1:32:36.500 --> 1:32:38.750
Tear that up!

1:32:38.833 --> 1:32:40.083
[Chike laughs]

1:32:43.875 --> 1:32:44.916
Wow!

1:32:45.458 --> 1:32:46.375
[Chike] Whoa!

1:32:47.333 --> 1:32:49.750
[tense music]

1:32:55.916 --> 1:32:58.500
I accept your deal!
[panting]

1:33:02.583 --> 1:33:04.750
[foreboding music]

1:33:06.166 --> 1:33:07.458
I could kill you right here.

1:33:08.166 --> 1:33:09.416
Right now.

1:33:09.500 --> 1:33:11.541
-No.
-[knife clanks]

1:33:11.791 --> 1:33:13.000
You couldn't.

1:33:15.166 --> 1:33:17.125
Is that all you have to say to me?

1:33:19.208 --> 1:33:21.291
You know, I...
I thought real hard and long

1:33:21.375 --> 1:33:22.625
about a speech...

1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:25.083
but nah.

1:33:25.708 --> 1:33:26.916
Fuck you!

1:33:27.791 --> 1:33:28.875
I won.

1:33:29.416 --> 1:33:30.333
Whoo!

1:33:31.916 --> 1:33:33.208
[Chike laughs]

1:33:33.958 --> 1:33:36.375
[gloomy music]

1:33:38.500 --> 1:33:40.250
[chair clanks]

1:33:57.291 --> 1:33:58.333
[sighs]

1:33:58.958 --> 1:34:02.625
[Grace] You are a lot less damaged
than I expected.

1:34:02.708 --> 1:34:04.666
Edem turned quicker
than I thought he would.

1:34:04.750 --> 1:34:05.791
[Grace sighs]

1:34:05.875 --> 1:34:06.833
Where is he?

1:34:06.916 --> 1:34:09.291
He's in the car,
giving his statement to Kelly.

1:34:09.375 --> 1:34:10.291
Okay.

1:34:10.375 --> 1:34:13.083
Well, I just wish we could make him pay
for what he did also.

1:34:13.166 --> 1:34:14.041
Oh.

1:34:15.125 --> 1:34:16.375
But we did.

1:34:25.791 --> 1:34:28.125
[gloomy music]

1:34:31.791 --> 1:34:32.708
[sighs]

1:34:32.791 --> 1:34:33.833
What?

1:34:34.166 --> 1:34:35.541
-How?
-How come?

1:34:36.708 --> 1:34:37.708
[Bamidele] How?

1:34:42.666 --> 1:34:44.791
I cannot believe she didn't tell me.

1:34:45.625 --> 1:34:46.625
How?

1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:48.791
Why would I wanna fake my own death?

1:34:48.875 --> 1:34:50.750
Because you don't want Madame
to steal your company.

1:34:50.833 --> 1:34:54.166
Come on, Aunty Enitan will never do that,
we have a deal.

1:34:54.791 --> 1:34:57.125
And if she stabs you in the back
like she did me?

1:34:58.416 --> 1:35:01.083
Hey, if I'm wrong,
you don't have to do anything.

1:35:01.458 --> 1:35:04.291
I go to jail and you're happily at home
for your family's crimes.

1:35:04.375 --> 1:35:05.708
But if I'm right,

1:35:05.791 --> 1:35:07.333
how do you get your company back?

1:35:08.333 --> 1:35:12.125
You are a horrible, manipulative person.

1:35:12.208 --> 1:35:14.166
Yeah, I learned from the best.

1:35:14.708 --> 1:35:16.000
And so did you.

1:35:16.083 --> 1:35:19.125
-I'm nothing like you.
-[Chike] Yeah, yeah.

1:35:19.208 --> 1:35:20.416
My father was an assassin,

1:35:20.500 --> 1:35:22.250
my mother was a whore,
and I was a drug trafficker.

1:35:22.833 --> 1:35:24.583
And the surface were nothing alike,

1:35:24.666 --> 1:35:27.291
-but Madame found--
-I am nothing like you.

1:35:27.375 --> 1:35:28.333
Motunrayo.

1:35:29.166 --> 1:35:32.000
You are about to set up your brother
for a crime he didn't commit,

1:35:32.083 --> 1:35:33.583
and use that to blackmail your mother

1:35:33.666 --> 1:35:35.791
into handing over
a large share of her company

1:35:36.166 --> 1:35:38.000
to her husband's mistress.

1:35:38.083 --> 1:35:39.125
Yeah.

1:35:39.333 --> 1:35:40.708
You are nothing like me.

1:35:43.041 --> 1:35:45.208
How do I know
that it's not one of your games?

1:35:45.958 --> 1:35:48.583
Because she's sending me to jail
for a very long time.

1:35:53.708 --> 1:35:54.791
[giggling]

1:35:55.666 --> 1:35:57.041
[laughs]

1:35:58.708 --> 1:36:00.875
I still can't believe you never told me.

1:36:00.958 --> 1:36:01.875
I know.

1:36:01.958 --> 1:36:04.916
That was payback for waiting as long
as you did to tell me about Madame.

1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:06.500
Now you know how it feels.

1:36:10.541 --> 1:36:13.583
It just doesn't feel right
that you're the only one going down.

1:36:14.041 --> 1:36:15.875
We both dealt drugs.

1:36:17.541 --> 1:36:19.000
Only because I made you.

1:36:19.875 --> 1:36:20.750
[sighs]

1:36:20.833 --> 1:36:22.916

that one of us is free.

[gloomy music]

1:36:30.041 --> 1:36:31.583
How about your pastor?

1:36:32.750 --> 1:36:35.291
I've burnt that bridge a long time ago.

1:36:37.083 --> 1:36:38.250
You never know.

1:36:48.125 --> 1:36:50.416
-Stop crying.
-I'm so sorry, I can't...

[somber music]

1:37:01.250 --> 1:37:02.708
[Kelly] Chike, we've got to go.

1:37:05.416 --> 1:37:07.208
Chike, we've got to go.

[Kelly] <i>You're ready?</i>

1:37:22.458 --> 1:37:24.000
Do you have everything you need?

1:37:24.083 --> 1:37:25.041
[Kelly] Yeah.

1:37:26.250 --> 1:37:27.875
Guess we're done then.

1:37:29.500 --> 1:37:30.583
Oh. Uh...

1:37:31.541 --> 1:37:33.541
Edem, I lied.

1:37:34.416 --> 1:37:35.708
Motunrayo is not dead.

1:37:36.375 --> 1:37:39.166
And that makes your deal invalid.

[Kelly] <i>I still can't believe
you pulled this off.</i>

1:38:08.541 --> 1:38:09.875
It's what I do.

1:38:11.333 --> 1:38:13.291
I took your request to my superiors.

1:38:15.125 --> 1:38:16.083
And?

1:38:16.416 --> 1:38:18.166
They left it to my discretion.

1:38:20.250 --> 1:38:22.666
We are willing to come to an arrangement

1:38:23.250 --> 1:38:26.125
for you to work with us
for the duration of your sentence.

1:38:26.375 --> 1:38:27.791
Half my sentence.

1:38:27.875 --> 1:38:28.958
What?

1:38:29.208 --> 1:38:31.291
Half my sentence, five years.

1:38:31.375 --> 1:38:33.458
Your sentence is for 20 years.

1:38:34.041 --> 1:38:35.666
Then a quarter of my sentence.

1:38:35.750 --> 1:38:36.666
[chuckles]

1:38:37.375 --> 1:38:39.500
You are in no position to negotiate.

Fine.

Five years.
