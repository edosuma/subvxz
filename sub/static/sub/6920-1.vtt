02:03.440 --> 02:05.169
Shh! Shh!

02:09.680 --> 02:11.125
We caught the bitch.

02:27.280 --> 02:28.361
Please don't hurt me.

02:29.560 --> 02:31.881
Don't be afraid, girl.

02:34.240 --> 02:35.605
Who are you?

02:41.560 --> 02:43.050
Somebody please help me.

02:43.200 --> 02:48.969
Only the evil book can undo
what the evil book has done.

02:49.120 --> 02:51.885
Please.
I just want to go home.

02:53.880 --> 02:56.884
Please.
I just want to go home.

03:06.120 --> 03:07.406
Daddy?

03:10.640 --> 03:12.529
Daddy, why are you
doing this to me?

03:12.640 --> 03:14.449
Who are these people?

03:14.600 --> 03:16.170
Look, they are
good people.

03:16.320 --> 03:18.607
They are here to help.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.643
What are you
talking about?

03:21.200 --> 03:22.611
Where's Mom?

03:23.320 --> 03:25.527
Mommy is dead, baby.

03:25.640 --> 03:26.971
You know that.

03:31.880 --> 03:32.961
You killed her.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.161
What?

03:34.320 --> 03:35.481
You did.

03:35.640 --> 03:38.291
No, why are you
saying these things?

03:38.360 --> 03:40.931
Please, I just want go home.

03:41.080 --> 03:42.241
I just want to go home.

03:42.480 --> 03:45.404
Do it! It's the only way
to save her soul!

03:48.040 --> 03:50.281
I'm so sorry, baby.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.283
Daddy, what is that?

03:58.840 --> 04:00.205
Daddy.

04:00.360 --> 04:02.966
Daddy, look at me.
It's me.

04:03.600 --> 04:06.649
Do it!
Give your daughter peace!

04:06.880 --> 04:09.565
I just want you to hold
me and take me home.

04:10.280 --> 04:11.930
Please.

04:17.040 --> 04:18.565
Please stop.

04:20.640 --> 04:23.484
I will rip your
soul out, Daddy.

04:26.320 --> 04:29.802
I'll rip your soul out,
you pathetic fuck!

04:31.920 --> 04:33.809
Motherfucker!

04:34.120 --> 04:35.121
I will kill you

04:35.200 --> 04:36.281
like I killed...

04:36.440 --> 04:39.205
your whore!

04:43.480 --> 04:44.720
Fuck!

04:45.360 --> 04:47.362
Fuck!

04:56.120 --> 04:57.485
I love you, baby.

06:26.840 --> 06:27.921
Hey.

06:28.080 --> 06:30.208
How's it going,
Mr. Hot Shit City Boy?

06:30.520 --> 06:32.363
Hey, Olivia.
Come here.

06:32.520 --> 06:34.488
Two arms, please.
Like you missed me.

06:34.720 --> 06:35.801
Mmm.

06:37.360 --> 06:38.805
This is my girl Natalie.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.082
Oh, the heartbreaker
from your car shop.

06:41.240 --> 06:42.480
The doctor?

06:42.720 --> 06:43.767
Actually, she's...

06:43.880 --> 06:45.245
I'm a registered nurse.

06:45.480 --> 06:46.925
Nurse.
Mmm-hmm.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.082
Right, sorry.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.168
You were supposed to be
here two hours ago, man.

06:51.320 --> 06:53.482
And that's our
irresistibly charming Eric.

06:53.680 --> 06:56.126
Teaching high school finally turned
you into a bitter old coot, huh?

06:56.280 --> 06:58.806
No, you did.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.201
You kept us waiting here
all morning.

07:01.480 --> 07:04.529
Good to see you too, man.
Come here.

07:05.520 --> 07:06.965
You look good.

07:07.920 --> 07:10.685
She's waiting for you
in the back.

07:11.360 --> 07:12.805
Great.

07:26.960 --> 07:28.041
Hey, Mia.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.211
I'll be damned.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.729
You actually came.

07:34.880 --> 07:36.848
Come on,
I'm your big brother.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.445
Of course I came.

07:38.960 --> 07:40.849
I know I
look like road kill.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.846
Oh, you look beautiful,
as always.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.971
And you're a charming
liar, as always.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.331
Grandpa?

07:52.440 --> 07:53.726
Hey.

07:54.280 --> 07:56.851
Hey, there buddy.

07:57.920 --> 08:00.446
We always loved this
place, didn't we?

08:01.120 --> 08:03.282
He missed you a lot,
you know.

08:06.680 --> 08:08.648
Oh, my God.
What?

08:09.360 --> 08:11.044
What is that?
What?

08:11.200 --> 08:12.725
Just this, right here.

08:14.960 --> 08:17.327
It's not funny!

08:18.400 --> 08:20.687
This is made from
a buckthorn tree.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.087
It's supposed to
make your will stronger.

08:23.240 --> 08:25.049
I thought you didn't
believe in that kind of stuff.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.362
I don't. But you do,

08:27.440 --> 08:28.601
so, maybe it'll work.

08:30.800 --> 08:31.961
Okay.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.241
Well, then, let's do this.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.601
Promise me you'll stay
with me until the end.

08:43.720 --> 08:45.051
I'm not going anywhere.

08:45.120 --> 08:46.884
Cross your heart.

08:47.320 --> 08:48.481
Okay.

08:49.840 --> 08:51.842
Hope to die.

08:55.120 --> 08:56.201
Okay.

08:56.480 --> 09:00.883
May my friends and family
witness this act...

09:01.280 --> 09:06.127
an irrevocable promise
to my commitment that...

09:09.560 --> 09:11.210
Fuck it.

09:14.960 --> 09:18.726
I promise not to
touch this shit...

09:18.880 --> 09:21.565
ever again.

09:26.200 --> 09:27.440
Okay.

09:28.760 --> 09:31.923
Let's play cold turkey.

09:37.360 --> 09:39.931
Hopefully,
this still works.

09:44.080 --> 09:45.605
Wait.

09:58.240 --> 10:00.686
Looks like
someone broke in.

10:01.520 --> 10:03.090
Be careful.

10:13.840 --> 10:16.241
What is that smell?

10:17.760 --> 10:21.685
Some teenagers probably just broke
in here to drink beer and bump uglies.

10:21.840 --> 10:23.251
Exactly.

10:24.840 --> 10:27.684
Mom would have hated
seeing the cabin like this.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.081
Okay.

10:29.920 --> 10:32.127
Let's make
this place livable.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.006
Hey.

11:12.200 --> 11:13.486
Are you okay?

11:15.040 --> 11:18.010
Do you remember that
lullaby Mom used to sing us?

11:18.720 --> 11:20.449
It was something like...

11:21.640 --> 11:25.929
"Baby, little baby,
it's time to say goodbye."

11:28.760 --> 11:29.886
"Baby, little baby..."

11:30.080 --> 11:31.525
Mia, please,
I don't think you need

11:31.600 --> 11:34.171
sad memories in
your head right now.

11:34.520 --> 11:36.170
Mom is not a sad one.

11:36.640 --> 11:38.244
You know what I mean.

11:41.800 --> 11:44.565
You know what? Her final
days at the hospital...

11:44.760 --> 11:48.845
Mom sometimes
thought I was you.

11:50.320 --> 11:53.767
She even called me David
for a whole day, once.

11:53.920 --> 11:57.003
And I played along,
because...

11:57.160 --> 12:00.687
Mia, I wanted to be there.
Okay, I did.

12:01.480 --> 12:03.084
But by the time
Mom got bad...

12:03.280 --> 12:05.760
I had just gotten the job
at the garage in Chicago.

12:07.080 --> 12:10.243
I don't know, I had a hard time finding
the right moment to come back.

12:12.040 --> 12:15.169
And then it was
too late. So...

12:17.680 --> 12:21.685
Maybe you were lucky, not to
see her the way that I did.

12:55.680 --> 12:58.001
It looks like
she is doing okay.

12:58.960 --> 13:00.849
David, there is something
you need to know.

13:03.720 --> 13:05.006
Okay.

13:05.920 --> 13:07.046
We already tried
this whole thing

13:07.120 --> 13:08.610
back in Flint last summer.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.287
Mia made
the same promises.

13:12.440 --> 13:16.331
She took the same
dramatic vow of sobriety

13:16.440 --> 13:17.965
before chucking her
dope down the toilet.

13:18.120 --> 13:20.202
She lasted eight hours
and quit.

13:22.720 --> 13:23.721
So, we don't want to

13:23.800 --> 13:25.131
give her that chance
this time.

13:25.920 --> 13:27.524
What do you mean?

13:28.720 --> 13:30.245
David, when she breaks...

13:30.840 --> 13:32.842
and believe me, she will...

13:34.080 --> 13:36.481
we don't want
to let her leave.

13:39.560 --> 13:42.086
What do you mean? You want
force her to stay here?

13:42.240 --> 13:43.480
Mia?

13:44.760 --> 13:47.240
This time the only way
is the hard way, man.

13:47.400 --> 13:48.481
She won't survive another OD.

13:48.640 --> 13:49.766
What?

13:51.160 --> 13:52.446
Mia OD'd?

13:53.680 --> 13:55.250
She didn't just OD.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.323
Legally, your sister died.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.048
They had to
defibrillate her.

14:04.080 --> 14:05.650
Jesus.

14:07.520 --> 14:10.490
We all need to be together on this.
Otherwise it won't work.

14:11.320 --> 14:12.810
Good boy.

14:13.720 --> 14:14.801
I came here to make things
better with my sister,

14:14.880 --> 14:15.927
not worse.

14:19.600 --> 14:21.602
If she asks me to
take her home at some point

14:21.680 --> 14:24.001
I'm going to
have to do it.

14:26.280 --> 14:28.965
I can't stand it!
Fuck!

14:29.440 --> 14:31.442
I can't stand it!

14:31.640 --> 14:33.642
What the fuck
is that smell?

14:33.800 --> 14:35.040
I know.

14:36.680 --> 14:38.011
It's okay.
It's okay.

14:38.480 --> 14:41.131
I can't stand that
fucking smell anymore.

14:41.320 --> 14:43.368
Lie down, okay?

14:43.520 --> 14:45.841
We're here for you.
I know, I know.

14:48.400 --> 14:51.802
We're all here.

14:52.640 --> 14:55.291
We're not going anywhere.

15:02.200 --> 15:04.567
Withdrawal is
kicking in hard.

15:04.720 --> 15:06.961
This should help you
get through the night.

15:07.800 --> 15:10.326
I don't know what
is wrong with you people...

15:10.480 --> 15:13.962
but there is something
dead and it reeks.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.964
But there is no smell.

15:16.120 --> 15:17.690
You're just
extra-sensitive right now.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.163
I just can't stand that
fucking smell anymore.

15:24.120 --> 15:25.246
Wait.

15:35.400 --> 15:36.925
Oh, is that blood?

15:52.280 --> 15:53.805
Shit. Oh...

15:55.880 --> 15:58.690
What's your
medical diagnosis now?

15:58.840 --> 16:01.491
It fucking stinks.

16:01.880 --> 16:03.723
Shit. Careful.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.884
These steps are
old and rotten.

16:06.480 --> 16:08.005
Yeah, like this
whole freaking house.

16:08.080 --> 16:09.081
I know.

16:16.400 --> 16:17.447
Ugh!

16:19.080 --> 16:21.242
It smells like
burnt hair.

16:22.560 --> 16:23.846
I think it's back there.

16:30.600 --> 16:31.761
Oh!

16:41.440 --> 16:42.566
Ugh!

16:46.720 --> 16:48.370
Oh, my God!

16:49.000 --> 16:50.001
Shit.

16:55.520 --> 16:56.931
What is this?

16:57.360 --> 17:00.125
I don't know.
Witchcraft?

17:00.920 --> 17:02.126
Who would do this?

17:07.119 --> 17:08.531
Shit, something
burned here.

17:11.960 --> 17:12.961
Look.

17:17.960 --> 17:19.200
Shit, man.

17:19.359 --> 17:21.931
What the fuck
happened here?

17:22.119 --> 17:24.248
Let's not go crazy
over this. Okay?

17:24.640 --> 17:26.608
I'll bury those dead cats
out back later.

17:26.760 --> 17:29.206
Yeah. The smell will
be gone in no time.

17:29.400 --> 17:31.129
Yeah, okay.

17:32.120 --> 17:34.964
And what about the voodoo
shit they did down there?

17:35.120 --> 17:38.329
No, no, no. Voodoo is more about
dolls and personal artifacts.

17:38.480 --> 17:39.811
This is
something different.

17:39.880 --> 17:41.245
Eric, that's enough.

17:43.480 --> 17:46.609
You shouldn't have touched
anything from that basement.

19:51.400 --> 19:54.688
"Naturom Demonto."

20:42.320 --> 20:43.321
"Kunda."

20:50.920 --> 20:51.921
"Astratta."

20:57.000 --> 20:58.843
"Montosse."

21:05.200 --> 21:06.201
"Canda."

21:18.640 --> 21:22.281
Please, God,
give me a break.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.884
Mia.

21:42.560 --> 21:43.721
What are you doing?

21:43.880 --> 21:47.327
I'm sorry, but I have to
get out of here right now.

21:47.480 --> 21:49.403
No, come on. The slumber
party isn't over yet.

21:49.560 --> 21:51.688
Yeah, we still haven't played
"Fuck, Marry, Kill," right?

21:51.840 --> 21:53.046
Mia, please look...

21:53.200 --> 21:55.009
I'm going insane here.

21:55.160 --> 21:59.165
Olivia, I feel like
I'm losing my mind.

21:59.240 --> 22:00.241
What is it?

22:03.720 --> 22:05.882
I will go through
with this, okay?

22:06.520 --> 22:08.170
I just...
I can't do it here.

22:08.560 --> 22:09.721
Mia...

22:11.600 --> 22:13.841
we have decided we're
not going to take you back.

22:17.240 --> 22:19.447
We can't lose you again.

22:19.600 --> 22:21.602
You're going to have to
stick it out this time.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.570
David, drive me home.

22:30.680 --> 22:32.409
Come on, David.

22:32.880 --> 22:35.690
Mia, maybe they're right.

22:39.560 --> 22:43.281
You were supposed to be here
to support me, not them.

22:43.440 --> 22:44.441
I'm here for you.

22:44.600 --> 22:45.965
That's why I came.
Oh, my God.

22:46.120 --> 22:47.963
I'm such an idiot.

22:48.120 --> 22:50.407
To think for
once in my life...

22:51.720 --> 22:52.926
I could count on you.

22:56.640 --> 22:58.210
Mia, we're just
trying to help you.

22:58.360 --> 23:00.442
Well, fuck you very much!

23:07.320 --> 23:08.606
Eric, leave her alone.

23:09.760 --> 23:10.761
Mia.

23:23.760 --> 23:24.761
Mia!

23:28.480 --> 23:29.481
Perfect.

23:30.480 --> 23:32.244
Fuck this. Fuck, fuck.

23:32.400 --> 23:33.765
Fuck!

23:34.600 --> 23:35.647
Fuck!

23:37.800 --> 23:41.850
What the fuck am I doing?
What the fuck am I doing?

25:24.960 --> 25:25.961
Mia!

25:29.280 --> 25:30.281
- Mia!
- Mia!

25:31.400 --> 25:32.686
Mia.

25:40.240 --> 25:41.241
Mia!

26:43.000 --> 26:44.001
Mia.

27:36.040 --> 27:37.166
Mia!

27:37.400 --> 27:38.401
Mia!

27:39.080 --> 27:40.081
Mia!

27:44.360 --> 27:45.771
Mia!
Shit.

27:49.080 --> 27:50.525
Oh, my God.

28:00.440 --> 28:02.204
Hey, how's she doing?

28:02.720 --> 28:05.451
Um, she's talking about
a woman in the woods.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.409
How the forest
attacked her.

28:08.440 --> 28:10.522
I don't know. It's just
crazy withdrawal talk.

28:10.840 --> 28:12.922
Don't you think we should
take her to a hospital?

28:13.080 --> 28:14.889
I feel like we're in
over our heads here.

28:15.040 --> 28:17.361
Okay. I am giving her
the exact same treatment

28:17.440 --> 28:19.044
she would get
at a hospital.

28:22.280 --> 28:25.762
If we leave now, all of this
mess will have been for nothing.

28:25.920 --> 28:28.287
Okay. What about
the wounds on her arms?

28:29.920 --> 28:31.729
I pulled
some thorns out.

28:32.040 --> 28:34.122
It looks like she might have run
into a thorn bush out there.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.643
She probably
did it on purpose.

28:37.640 --> 28:38.641
What?

28:40.600 --> 28:41.601
David...

28:42.600 --> 28:43.806
from now on,
she is going to do

28:43.880 --> 28:45.564
whatever it takes
to get out of here.

29:03.960 --> 29:04.961
Mia.

29:07.320 --> 29:09.322
Listen, you have to
get out of those clothes.

29:09.920 --> 29:10.967
All right?
Take a shower.

29:11.120 --> 29:12.121
David.

29:13.680 --> 29:15.125
Please.

29:16.160 --> 29:17.491
Please.

29:19.120 --> 29:22.488
You have to get me...

29:23.480 --> 29:24.845
out of here.

29:27.840 --> 29:29.205
Nobody said this
was going to be easy.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.161
No.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.809
You don't understand.

29:36.640 --> 29:40.042
There was something
in the woods, David.

29:45.000 --> 29:51.042
And I think it's in
here with us now.

29:52.640 --> 29:54.563
With me in the room?

30:09.480 --> 30:11.323
Look. You know
it's all in your head.

30:12.720 --> 30:14.165
Just try to
get it together.

30:16.800 --> 30:18.723
You'll feel better
tomorrow, okay?

30:18.920 --> 30:20.809
You'll be glad
we were such assholes.

30:23.800 --> 30:24.801
Okay.

31:02.240 --> 31:04.925
Eric, what are you doing?

31:05.080 --> 31:07.242
Would you please just
get rid of that thing?

31:07.400 --> 31:10.244
You should be downstairs helping
your friend clean up that mess.

31:10.920 --> 31:13.048
I don't know who
you're talking about.

31:13.760 --> 31:15.649
Don't act like you
don't care about him.

31:16.280 --> 31:17.930
I know you do.

31:19.240 --> 31:21.561
I think we can all agree
he hasn't cared about us

31:21.640 --> 31:24.086
for the past
freaking century.

31:25.480 --> 31:27.130
Well, he's here now.

31:29.400 --> 31:30.606
Yeah.

31:31.640 --> 31:33.051
Truly amazing.

31:36.640 --> 31:38.404
Ugh.

32:05.840 --> 32:07.001
Grandpa?

32:12.640 --> 32:13.926
Grandpa!

32:20.840 --> 32:22.171
Grandpa?

32:22.680 --> 32:24.762
Come here, boy.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.047
Fuck.

32:36.200 --> 32:37.361
Grandpa.

32:39.840 --> 32:41.285
No, no, no.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.562
Hey, boy. Come here.

32:52.320 --> 32:53.845
What did you get into?

32:55.320 --> 32:56.367
Fuck.

32:58.160 --> 32:59.571
What happened?

33:20.600 --> 33:21.601
Mia?

33:21.760 --> 33:23.046
She's in the shower.

33:23.760 --> 33:26.047
What happened? David?

33:28.440 --> 33:29.441
Mia?

33:30.880 --> 33:32.370
Mia, open the door.

33:36.040 --> 33:37.451
Hey, Mia, open the door.

33:38.400 --> 33:39.526
Open the door!

33:39.600 --> 33:40.681
David,
what are you doing?

33:43.880 --> 33:45.962
David, stop and
tell me what's going on.

33:46.120 --> 33:48.885
Mia, open
the fucking door!

33:55.080 --> 33:56.081
Mia?

33:56.600 --> 33:58.125
Mia, open
the fucking door!

33:58.280 --> 33:59.281
David!

34:01.720 --> 34:02.721
David!

34:04.040 --> 34:05.121
Stop it!

34:05.280 --> 34:06.441
Mia!

34:11.280 --> 34:12.327
Mia?

34:13.960 --> 34:14.960
Mia?

34:18.159 --> 34:19.161
Olivia!

34:21.400 --> 34:22.889
Holy shit!

34:23.080 --> 34:24.650
Mia!

34:36.239 --> 34:37.241
Shit.

34:38.440 --> 34:40.408
This is insane.

34:47.840 --> 34:49.001
Fuck. Where is it?

35:15.520 --> 35:17.204
This can't be happening.

35:44.600 --> 35:48.082
I gave her a sedative so she should
be out for a couple of hours.

35:49.240 --> 35:53.165
But, fuck, her burns are serious.
Like, second, third degree.

35:54.080 --> 35:55.605
This is so wrong.

35:55.880 --> 35:57.689
Nobody could have known she
would do something so twisted!

35:57.880 --> 35:59.689
No, you should have known!

35:59.880 --> 36:01.803
We've been following your
lead since we got here.

36:04.160 --> 36:05.650
We should have left
when Mia wanted to.

36:05.760 --> 36:09.162
Baby, please! Let's not
lose our heads, okay?

36:09.600 --> 36:12.285
With any luck, it will stop
raining in a couple of hours...

36:12.440 --> 36:13.726
and we'll be able to cross
the creek in the morning,

36:13.800 --> 36:15.290
and take her
to a hospital.

36:15.480 --> 36:17.926
Okay? Everything
is going to be fine.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.808
"Everything is
going to be fine"?

36:22.400 --> 36:24.402
Everything is
going to be fine.

36:26.560 --> 36:29.848
I don't know if you've noticed
this, but nothing has been fine.

36:30.880 --> 36:34.089
And everything has been
getting worse every second.

36:40.040 --> 36:41.041
Mia?

36:49.400 --> 36:50.401
Mia?

36:52.200 --> 36:53.486
What are you doing?

36:58.120 --> 37:00.361
Mia, put the gun down.

37:00.880 --> 37:02.530
Put the gun down, please.

37:08.240 --> 37:09.810
Mia.

37:10.960 --> 37:12.166
Put the fucking gun down!

37:21.160 --> 37:22.161
Die!

37:25.360 --> 37:27.966
One by one
we will take you!

37:31.400 --> 37:34.085
You are all
going to die tonight.

37:38.160 --> 37:40.561
The gun.
The gun, quick!

37:41.520 --> 37:42.567
Baby?

38:02.480 --> 38:03.481
Mia!

38:16.400 --> 38:18.209
Let me out!
She's totally psychotic.

38:18.640 --> 38:20.404
My God,
what happened to her eyes?

38:30.920 --> 38:32.081
What's she doing?

38:32.880 --> 38:34.803
It sounds like she's hitting
herself against something.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.445
This is impossible.

38:36.880 --> 38:38.962
I just gave her enough sedative
to put a horse to sleep.

38:39.120 --> 38:40.770
Give her another shot!

38:41.360 --> 38:43.647
That could
put her into a coma.

38:43.920 --> 38:46.207
For Christ's sakes, she's going
to kill herself down there!

38:48.000 --> 38:49.206
Go get the shot!

38:51.400 --> 38:52.970
I have to get the shrapnel
out of my arm.

38:53.120 --> 38:55.122
What? I have tweezers
in my purse.

38:56.680 --> 38:58.603
David. Listen to me.

38:58.760 --> 39:02.162
I don't think a tranquilizer
is going to do shit.

39:03.280 --> 39:06.284
Because I don't think we're dealing
with a freaking panic attack here!

39:06.880 --> 39:09.360
I'm scared that what's happening
to Mia has something to do...

39:09.520 --> 39:11.522
with the fucking witchcraft
in the basement!

39:38.000 --> 39:39.126
Ow!

40:35.160 --> 40:36.161
Olivia!

40:46.080 --> 40:47.491
Olivia?

41:10.200 --> 41:11.201
Olivia?

41:12.680 --> 41:14.011
Are you okay?

41:21.480 --> 41:22.481
Olivia?

41:44.880 --> 41:48.009
Olivia,
what are you doing in there?

41:52.120 --> 41:53.121
Olivia.

41:56.720 --> 41:57.721
Olivia.

42:02.320 --> 42:03.651
Are you okay?

42:08.520 --> 42:10.443
Oh, my God!

42:10.920 --> 42:13.207
Why the fuck
did you do that?

42:36.000 --> 42:37.001
Kill him.

43:16.040 --> 43:17.041
No!

43:27.000 --> 43:28.047
Ah!

43:28.520 --> 43:30.284
She tried to kill me.

43:30.560 --> 43:32.642
She tried to kill me.

43:49.880 --> 43:50.881
Fuck.

43:54.160 --> 43:55.605
You hold that.
You got it?

44:07.280 --> 44:09.009
Hold it there, okay?
Hold it.

44:09.560 --> 44:10.561
Fuck it.

44:13.800 --> 44:18.203
David,
I did something terrible.

44:19.680 --> 44:20.966
I'm sure you
didn't mean to hurt her.

44:21.120 --> 44:24.203
That thing I
killed was not Olivia.

44:24.360 --> 44:25.646
He's losing
too much blood.

44:25.800 --> 44:27.450
Baby, he needs water and sugar.
Okay?

44:27.600 --> 44:28.601
Go.

44:29.360 --> 44:30.327
Go!

44:30.400 --> 44:31.686
Okay. Okay.

44:35.160 --> 44:36.605
All right.
David.

44:38.480 --> 44:41.450
I read a passage
from that book.

44:41.600 --> 44:44.763
It was some
sort of prayer.

44:45.880 --> 44:47.803
I released something, David.

44:49.920 --> 44:54.244
I released something evil.

45:54.920 --> 45:55.921
Natalie?

46:05.160 --> 46:06.207
Mia?

46:07.960 --> 46:08.961
Natalie.

46:13.800 --> 46:16.690
What am I doing
down here?

46:18.320 --> 46:20.448
My leg hurts.

46:22.120 --> 46:23.610
I can't move.

46:27.480 --> 46:29.687
I'm going to come
down there, okay?

46:31.520 --> 46:34.524
Why did you
lock me down here?

46:35.120 --> 46:37.248
You were supposed to
help me.

46:37.440 --> 46:40.046
Hey, we're trying
to help you, okay?

46:40.880 --> 46:43.770
You were out of control,
you know?

46:44.200 --> 46:46.885
You got violent and we
didn't know what else to do.

46:48.120 --> 46:51.920
Mia, something really
terrible has happened...

46:52.120 --> 46:53.963
and we have to
get out of here now.

46:54.160 --> 46:57.369
You don't understand.

46:57.440 --> 46:58.646
He's not going to
let you leave!

47:00.880 --> 47:02.848
And he's not going to stop
until he has you.

47:04.040 --> 47:05.883
Until he has all of you!

48:17.640 --> 48:20.405
I can smell
your filthy soul.

48:47.520 --> 48:49.045
Kiss me, you dirty cunt!

49:07.880 --> 49:10.565
Why don't you come down here so I
can suck your cock, pretty boy!

49:10.960 --> 49:12.007
Mia.

49:12.080 --> 49:13.889
Mia's not here,
you fucking idiot!

49:15.840 --> 49:18.047
Your little sister
is being raped in hell!

49:33.240 --> 49:36.005
Home. I want to go home.

49:53.040 --> 49:54.041
Eric.

49:56.080 --> 49:58.526
I don't know why, but I
thought this would end it.

50:01.480 --> 50:04.643
But this book
does not burn.

50:06.920 --> 50:09.161
It does not fucking burn.

50:12.560 --> 50:15.245
Tell me what's
going on here.

50:28.080 --> 50:30.924
This book uses some...

50:32.720 --> 50:34.245
ancient alphabet.

50:34.400 --> 50:37.051
There's some translations,
but...

50:37.120 --> 50:39.009
Just scattered notes.

50:40.040 --> 50:41.963
They all refer to some...

50:43.360 --> 50:44.805
evil entity.

50:45.800 --> 50:47.962
A taker of souls.

50:49.760 --> 50:51.250
A demon.

50:52.160 --> 50:53.161
It says...

50:55.640 --> 50:57.881
"Once he feasts
on five souls...

50:58.040 --> 51:02.170
"the sky will bleed again
and the abomination...

51:02.720 --> 51:04.449
"will rise from Hell."

51:48.000 --> 51:49.331
This is insane.

51:49.480 --> 51:53.929
This thing is attached to
Mia's soul like a leech...

51:54.080 --> 51:55.923
it's becoming her.

51:56.480 --> 52:01.361
If we want to stop this,
if we want to help Mia...

52:08.240 --> 52:10.720
I think we're going
to have to kill her.

52:12.160 --> 52:13.491
What did you say?

52:13.640 --> 52:14.641
Everything says...

52:14.800 --> 52:17.246
Eric! We're not going to
fucking kill anybody!

52:17.840 --> 52:19.649
Are you listening
to yourself?

52:21.360 --> 52:23.522
What about those dead cats
down in the basement?

52:23.680 --> 52:25.523
I mean, maybe they
had some disease.

52:25.600 --> 52:27.762
Some virus that
spread to Mia...

52:27.920 --> 52:29.809
and then she
passed it to Olivia

52:29.880 --> 52:31.211
when she puked
all over her face!

52:32.160 --> 52:34.640
But what kind of a virus
makes a person

52:34.720 --> 52:37.166
cut off their face
with a piece of glass?

52:40.520 --> 52:42.363
Oh, God.

52:57.360 --> 52:59.931
I don't know what we're
dealing with here, okay?

53:01.240 --> 53:04.847
But it stopped raining, and in a couple
of hours the river will be clear...

53:05.000 --> 53:08.402
and we're going to get out of this place.
All of us.

53:08.960 --> 53:11.611
It doesn't matter
where we go.

53:11.760 --> 53:14.366
If we don't do
something right now...

53:14.520 --> 53:17.091
we are all going
to be dead by then!

53:54.800 --> 53:56.643
Don't do it, you little bitch!
Don't cut it off!

54:05.600 --> 54:06.806
Don't cut it off!

54:07.400 --> 54:08.526
FUCK you!

54:16.520 --> 54:17.760
No, no, no!

54:20.560 --> 54:21.561
No!

54:43.920 --> 54:47.970
I had to do it.
And I feel much better now.

55:00.920 --> 55:03.571
Hold on, baby.
Hold on, please.

55:04.000 --> 55:07.447
Eric and I are going to
put a stop to this, okay?

55:08.120 --> 55:10.248
I promise that everything
is going to be fine.

55:10.400 --> 55:12.164
Okay? Okay, baby?

55:13.120 --> 55:16.090
She just cut her
fucking arm off.

55:16.240 --> 55:18.208
Does that sound fine?

55:28.840 --> 55:31.161
These inscriptions
are confusing,

55:31.240 --> 55:33.083
sometimes contradictory...

55:33.240 --> 55:35.242
but they are consistent
about one thing.

55:36.760 --> 55:38.410
In order to stop this,

55:38.520 --> 55:41.444
the possessed
must be cleansed.

55:41.920 --> 55:43.968
Purified.

55:44.280 --> 55:46.851
The book describes
three specific ways.

55:49.720 --> 55:51.245
Alive burial.

55:55.760 --> 55:57.489
Bodily dismemberment.

55:57.640 --> 55:59.802
Dismemberment.

56:03.440 --> 56:06.205
And purification by fire.

56:10.280 --> 56:11.486
Are you sure
this will work?

56:13.880 --> 56:15.006
If we...

56:17.680 --> 56:22.004
If I kill my sister,
she will be at peace?

56:22.160 --> 56:25.562
Am I sure?
Of course not.

56:25.760 --> 56:27.330
This is not
a science book!

56:28.600 --> 56:30.489
But look,
I'm sure of one thing.

56:30.640 --> 56:34.884
Whatever is inside Mia
is the cause of all this.

56:35.720 --> 56:38.724
If she dies, then this thing
is going to die with her.

56:38.880 --> 56:41.087
What if she
just lost her mind?

56:43.280 --> 56:45.123
What if she just
needs a doctor?

56:45.280 --> 56:46.884
What? A doctor?

56:48.720 --> 56:50.370
My mom died in
a mental hospital.

56:50.440 --> 56:51.726
She was crazy.

56:52.240 --> 56:53.401
She was deranged,

56:53.480 --> 56:54.720
she was a monster.

56:56.600 --> 56:57.601
I've always feared that

56:57.680 --> 56:59.444
me and Mia would
end up like her.

57:08.000 --> 57:12.050
You are just
a fucking coward.

57:12.240 --> 57:14.641
You know exactly
what we have to do...

57:14.800 --> 57:17.849
but you're too scared
to go through with it.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.571
I'm going to burn
this fucking place down.

57:20.720 --> 57:23.371
And I'm going to
end this nightmare.

57:24.440 --> 57:27.569
Why don't you
just run away?

57:27.840 --> 57:31.049
Go hide beneath
some rock somewhere.

57:31.200 --> 57:33.521
You know you're
great at that.

57:39.640 --> 57:41.130
Oh, shit.

58:57.200 --> 58:58.964
Where the fuck
did she go?

58:59.440 --> 59:00.566
David.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.401
Take it before she does.

59:40.120 --> 59:41.121
No!

59:43.800 --> 59:45.086
Stop!

59:54.800 --> 59:56.086
No, no, no!

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:29.090
David.

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:38.524
Why are you hurting me?

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:48.449
My face hurts.

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:51.640
Why?

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:57.124
Why...
Why does my face hurt?

01:00:58.720 --> 01:00:59.767
Baby.

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:02.521
Nat.

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:40.490
Come on, man.
Here we are.

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.367
Hey. Hold on.

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:49.849
Don't die on me, please!

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:53.120
Dying wouldn't be
so bad right now.

01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:59.646
I just don't want to
become the devil's bitch.

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.524
I'm going to do
what I got to do.

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:10.206
I'm going to do
what I got to do. Okay?

01:02:58.240 --> 01:02:59.810
I'm sorry, Mia.

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:02.446
I love you.

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:08.480
♪ Baby, little baby

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:11.729

say goodbye

♪ I wish that
I could stay ♪

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:38.326
I can't do this.

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:42.730
I can't do this.

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:21.129
This time the only fucking
way is the hard way!

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:03.569
David.

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:07.081
Murderer.

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:10.370
Coward.

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:14.170
Eric.

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:35.441
Hey. Okay?

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:39.527
David.

01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:43.130
I missed you, man.

01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:49.727
You know that, buddy.

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:11.160
David?

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:15.203
David?

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:18.929
I can't move!
I can't breathe!

01:09:19.439 --> 01:09:20.930
David!

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:23.404
Help me!

01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:26.363
Help me, David!

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:28.051
You're not her.

01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:29.850
David!

01:09:30.279 --> 01:09:31.281
Help me!

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:33.524
You're not her!

01:09:40.359 --> 01:09:42.362
Why do you hate me, David?

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:46.769
I know you do.

01:09:48.279 --> 01:09:50.122
You left home.

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.362
You left me all alone

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:55.681
with our sick mother.

01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:57.444
And I was just a kid.

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:00.680
You made me lie.

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:04.767
Every time she
screamed your name,

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:07.047
I told her you were
coming to see her.

01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:10.247
Like you promised.

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:12.684
But you never did.

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:17.050
Please stop it,
I'm begging you.

01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:21.649
I know Mother
hates you now,

01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:23.529
and she waits for you
in hell.

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:35.725
Shut up. Shut up.

01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:55.049
I'm so sorry.

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:00.685
I should have been there.

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:05.286
I should have
been there for you.

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:02.169
Come on.
Please, come back.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.401
Come on, Mia.
Come back to me, please!

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:57.407
Okay, you are at peace.

01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:00.729
You are at peace now.

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:28.401
David?

01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:36.411
Mia?

01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:44.924
It was so horrible.

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:49.042
It was so horrible.

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:53.321
It's okay.
It's all over now.

01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:59.684
Thanks for not
leaving me, David.

01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:11.090
Wait here. I'm going
to get the car keys.

01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:13.049
Okay?
Yeah.

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:17.841
David!

01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:20.649
Go. Please, go.

01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:21.721
Go!

01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:25.283
I'm not going to go anywhere.
I'm not going anywhere!

01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:31.602
Here, take the keys.
Look at me, let's go.

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:33.364
Come on. Let's go.

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:40.571
Get out of here.

01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:45.089
No! No!

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:46.321
David!

01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:49.009
David!

01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:55.046
No! No!

01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:58.603
David! David!

01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:10.246
He's coming.

01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:45.042
Mia.

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:45.324
Come here, you bitch!

01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:11.966
Come on.

01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:12.690
You're going to die here,
you pathetic junkie!

01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:17.725
I've had enough
of this shit.

01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:58.002
I will feast on your soul.

01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:03.287
Feast on this, motherfucker!

01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:17.363
Die!

01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:40.282
Go back to Hell, bitch.

01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:32.090
I believe I
have made a significant find

01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:34.049
in the Candarian Ruins...

01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:36.680
a volume of ancient
Sumerian burial practices

01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:38.808
and funerary incantations.

01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:42.483
It is entitled
"Naturom Demonto."

01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:45.211
Roughly translated,
"Book of the Dead."

01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:49.405
The book is bound in human flesh
and inked in human blood.

01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:53.008
It deals with demons,
demon resurrection...

01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:55.089
those forces
which roam the forest

01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:57.163
and dark bowers
of man's domain.

01:29:58.120 --> 01:30:01.169
The first few pages warn that
these enduring creatures...

01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:04.324
may lie dormant
but are never truly dead.

01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:06.763
They may be recalled
to active life

01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:09.360
through the incantations
presented in this book.

01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:12.091
It is through recitation
of these passages

01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:13.525
that the demons
are given license...

01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:16.168
to possess the living.

01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:52.285
I have seen the dark shadows
moving in the woods...

01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:55.046
and I have no doubt that
whatever I have resurrected

01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:56.326
through this book...

01:30:56.480 --> 01:30:59.768
is sure to come
calling for me.

01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:12.245
Groovy.
