00:00.220 --> 00:02.271
Previously on "secrets and lies"...

00:02.281 --> 00:03.445
Who would have killed her, Liam?

00:03.455 --> 00:04.704
Do you know about the bank statement?

00:04.714 --> 00:05.849
I think it had something
to do with Neil.

00:05.859 --> 00:07.539
She... she started to look
into all of his accounts.

00:07.549 --> 00:10.285
- Did Kate have any other devices?
- No.

00:10.295 --> 00:11.932
Why did Kate send you that photo?

00:11.942 --> 00:13.745
It's my daughter. She's missing.

00:13.755 --> 00:16.193
If I see your daughter or her
friend, I'll let you know.

00:16.204 --> 00:18.572
Sent me the photo when she
saw Carly at your party.

00:18.640 --> 00:20.107
Rachel. You remember her?

00:20.175 --> 00:21.842
You took her and Carly to the Scybox.

00:21.910 --> 00:23.778
It's his daughter, man!
He's gonna hurt you!

00:23.845 --> 00:26.561
Y-your daughter was just there.
Carly's a call girl.

00:26.571 --> 00:28.447
- Detective.
- Detective.

00:34.723 --> 00:36.184
Detective?

00:38.260 --> 00:39.093
What the hell, man?

00:39.161 --> 00:41.558
I think your boyfriend, Neil,
has got the answers that we need.

00:41.568 --> 00:43.497
But Cornell has got him now, so...

00:43.565 --> 00:45.299
Have you been working
with her this whole time?

00:45.309 --> 00:47.391
No. Not at first.

00:47.401 --> 00:49.840
Something happened,
and I didn't have a choice.

00:49.850 --> 00:53.235
So, the only thing you
weren't lying about

00:53.245 --> 00:55.446
is that everybody lies.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.217
Do you even have a daughter?

00:59.285 --> 01:00.755
Yes.

01:00.765 --> 01:04.191
Okay, I'm a cop,
but I'm not a local one.

01:04.411 --> 01:06.491
I'm NYPD.

01:07.483 --> 01:09.894
And my daughter is missing.

01:12.657 --> 01:13.845
I asked you to meet me for dinner.

01:13.855 --> 01:15.589
- Where were you?
- I didn't feel well.

01:15.599 --> 01:16.541
You didn't feel well?

01:16.551 --> 01:18.338
And I didn't like the
other people you invited.

01:18.348 --> 01:20.532
The other people? It's just Mitch.
He's like an uncle.

01:20.542 --> 01:22.752
No, he's your partner.
He's not my family.

01:24.029 --> 01:25.754
What the hell is that?

01:28.091 --> 01:29.423
Who the hell are you?!

01:29.433 --> 01:31.893
- Look...
- Don't walk. Run! Go.

01:32.356 --> 01:33.801
Go!

01:34.778 --> 01:36.391
Hey, what is wrong with you?!

01:36.401 --> 01:37.868
I'm 18! You're not in charge.

01:37.936 --> 01:39.203
Look, my house, my rules.

01:39.270 --> 01:41.171
You're not an adult
till you act like one.

01:41.239 --> 01:43.067
- If you weren't such an ass...
- Whoa. Watch your language, man.

01:43.077 --> 01:44.474
I wouldn't have to hide who I'm seeing.

01:44.542 --> 01:45.809
You're not seeing anyone!

01:45.877 --> 01:47.344
You're just sleeping your way through

01:47.412 --> 01:48.812
the whole damn senior class.

01:58.371 --> 02:01.542
She left later that night,
and I haven't seen her since.

02:01.552 --> 02:03.954
So, your kid was unhappy, and she left.

02:04.021 --> 02:05.522
Doesn't mean she's in trouble.

02:05.590 --> 02:07.491
You really think that
I'm the type of person

02:07.558 --> 02:09.726
that misunderstands the level
of danger in a situation?

02:09.794 --> 02:11.395
No, I think you're the kind of guy

02:11.462 --> 02:12.729
who lies to people for a living.

02:12.797 --> 02:14.364
Look, I needed something from Cornell.

02:14.432 --> 02:16.867
- She needed something from me.
- Yeah! She needed you to spy on me!

02:16.934 --> 02:18.168
No, if I wanted to screw you,

02:18.178 --> 02:20.352
I could have told her
about Liam's fraud.

02:20.362 --> 02:23.573
- The Feds would have a field day, man.
- What did you tell her?

02:25.359 --> 02:27.511
Nothing you need to worry about.

02:27.578 --> 02:29.513
I'm not worried.

02:30.997 --> 02:32.680
I'm no longer a suspect.

02:32.690 --> 02:35.270
You know what? Till she's
got a perp in chains,

02:35.280 --> 02:37.447
no one's in the clear.

02:41.722 --> 02:45.722
She, um, give you any
updates on the case?

02:45.790 --> 02:49.293
If Cornell thought you were just
the grieving husband, she would.

02:50.362 --> 02:51.595
Test it.

02:51.605 --> 02:52.841
You need to go.

03:10.581 --> 03:12.512
This guy is no working stiff.

03:12.522 --> 03:14.356
He's got resources and people.

03:14.424 --> 03:15.691
All right? You can't just bully him.

03:15.759 --> 03:18.060
This isn't my first interrogation.

03:18.128 --> 03:20.529
I'm aware of your impressive
close rate, Detective.

03:20.597 --> 03:23.594
You know, you'd close a lot
quicker as part of a team.

03:23.604 --> 03:24.700
Let me do my job.

03:24.768 --> 03:28.237
Cornell, it's been almost two
years since your partner died.

03:28.304 --> 03:30.973
I'm getting tired of you
making excuses to work solo.

03:31.040 --> 03:35.043
We've been over this.
I work better alone.

03:35.111 --> 03:37.146
Push him as far as you can,

03:37.213 --> 03:39.548
but don't let it get
to where he invokes.

03:39.616 --> 03:42.659
Last thing we need around
here is another lawyer.

03:48.324 --> 03:50.726
Okay, yeah, I-I did lie.

03:50.794 --> 03:53.595
- I know the girl in the picture.
- Carly.

03:53.663 --> 03:55.564
Yeah, but it has nothing
to do with Kate's death.

03:55.632 --> 03:59.168
It's not for you to determine
the relevance of anything.

04:01.738 --> 04:03.739
How do you know Carly?

04:03.807 --> 04:06.241
Um...

04:06.309 --> 04:08.744
Look, I've... I've been
married three times.

04:08.812 --> 04:11.180
So, now I find it
easier to pay up front.

04:11.247 --> 04:12.714
So, she's a prostitute?

04:12.782 --> 04:15.284
I mean, I prefer escort, but, yeah.

04:15.351 --> 04:17.619
Yeah, I lied 'cause I was embarrassed.

04:17.687 --> 04:19.188
So, that's your story?

04:19.255 --> 04:20.221
No, it's not a story.

04:20.290 --> 04:21.957
I... look, I screwed her in my car.

04:22.024 --> 04:23.692
That's where I was for 30 minutes.

04:23.760 --> 04:26.028
And then Liam saw me
cleaning up in my office.

04:26.095 --> 04:27.863
I swear.

04:28.348 --> 04:31.567
The problem is the only way
for me to confirm your story

04:31.634 --> 04:33.029
is to interview Carly,

04:33.126 --> 04:35.037
and locating her has proven difficult.

04:35.104 --> 04:36.638
Look, you know, I'd love to help,

04:36.706 --> 04:39.074
but I met her in a bar a few months ago.

04:39.142 --> 04:40.476
All I got was a phone number.

04:40.543 --> 04:43.545
- Not the service number?
- What?

04:43.613 --> 04:45.781
Well, most escorts go through a service

04:45.849 --> 04:47.916
until they're comfortable
with their client,

04:47.984 --> 04:50.652
and then they want to
cut out the middleman.

04:50.720 --> 04:52.421
Yeah, I don't know about any of that.

04:52.489 --> 04:53.889
I just... all I have is her cell.

04:53.957 --> 04:56.758
Right, which is
conveniently disconnected.

04:56.826 --> 05:00.329
Look, lady, that's your problem.
I'm sorry that I lied.

05:00.396 --> 05:03.098
People are only sorry
when they get caught.

05:05.694 --> 05:09.271
Look, if I'm not under
arrest, I'd like to go.

05:09.339 --> 05:12.039
And if I am, I want to
talk to my attorney.

05:23.520 --> 05:26.488
Have a good night, Mr. Oliver.

05:41.613 --> 05:43.739
You forget your code?

05:46.034 --> 05:48.042
From your wife's P.O. Box.

05:52.849 --> 05:56.378
Amanda told me Neil was released
from custody last night. Why?

05:56.388 --> 05:58.387
I don't have to share that with you.

05:58.454 --> 06:02.475
As next of kin, I'm entitled to
an update on your progress...

06:02.485 --> 06:03.692
Or lack thereof.

06:03.760 --> 06:05.694
I didn't hold Mr. Oliver

06:05.762 --> 06:07.696
for the same reason I didn't arrest you.

06:07.764 --> 06:09.289
'Cause he didn't kill Kate.

06:09.299 --> 06:10.558
You're both liars,

06:10.568 --> 06:13.368
and while that makes you guilty
of any number of things,

06:13.436 --> 06:14.872
it doesn't prove that you're killers.

06:14.882 --> 06:17.751
I didn't lie about being on that roof.

06:17.761 --> 06:20.561
I didn't answer under
advice from my counsel.

06:24.103 --> 06:27.653
So, you'd never
lie to me, Mr. Warner?

06:27.909 --> 06:29.724
I'm sure if I did,

06:30.393 --> 06:33.300
your friend from the
NYPD would tell you.

06:36.457 --> 06:38.792
You seemed eager to get
your wife's mail back

06:38.802 --> 06:41.737
the other day at the police station.

06:41.747 --> 06:45.007
Or maybe you were there
for something else.

06:45.017 --> 06:46.603
Do you have any idea why your wife

06:46.613 --> 06:50.413
had a credit-card charge
for a private DNA lab?

06:51.479 --> 06:52.815
Sorry. No.

06:55.708 --> 06:57.479
Maybe it had something to do

06:57.489 --> 07:00.289
with the child that she
gave up for adoption.

07:03.677 --> 07:08.166
That's a delinquent mortgage
note from a property in Boone.

07:08.377 --> 07:10.476
It seems your wife paid it off.

07:12.449 --> 07:14.849
Did you not know about that, either?

07:19.089 --> 07:20.322
Yes, Detective.

07:22.125 --> 07:25.494
I married a woman I knew nothing about.

07:27.629 --> 07:28.915
Now...

07:30.267 --> 07:33.569
Don't you have someone
else's life to destroy?

07:40.809 --> 07:42.454
Look, everything is gonna be fine.

07:42.464 --> 07:44.899
You... you just need to calm down.

07:44.967 --> 07:48.336
I can't keep saying the same thing.

07:49.299 --> 07:50.365
Eric.

07:50.375 --> 07:52.696
Hey, I-I'm sorry about the meeting.

07:52.706 --> 07:55.789
I'll deal with you later.

07:55.799 --> 07:57.472
I can't believe they let you out.

07:57.482 --> 07:58.838
I can't believe you set me up.

07:58.848 --> 08:00.177
Did you kill my wife?

08:00.187 --> 08:01.472
How can you even think that?!

08:01.482 --> 08:03.383
'Cause you lied to me about
the hooker at the party!

08:03.451 --> 08:04.565
I told you why.

08:04.575 --> 08:06.054
Yeah, because you were
embarrassed? Come on!

08:06.064 --> 08:07.397
Wh-what about the bank statement?

08:07.465 --> 08:08.599
What are you talking about?

08:08.666 --> 08:10.467
You know exactly what I'm talking about!

08:10.535 --> 08:12.603
You set up an account at
another bank across town

08:12.670 --> 08:14.605
so you could siphon
money from this firm!

08:14.672 --> 08:16.640
That's insane! Where are
you getting this from?

08:16.708 --> 08:18.893
- Eric, let's just calm down.
- No. If I find out you killed Kate...

08:18.903 --> 08:20.911
I didn't do it, and I'm
sick of you accusing me!

08:20.921 --> 08:23.013
Neil, leave.

08:23.081 --> 08:24.395
- Neil!
- Yeah.

08:25.502 --> 08:27.236
I'm going.

08:27.862 --> 08:29.372
I quit.

08:39.568 --> 08:41.793
Wait. So, Neil really is gone?

08:41.803 --> 08:44.669
That... that's not what this
family meeting is about.

08:44.679 --> 08:46.240
We have convened to discuss

08:46.308 --> 08:48.920
- Kate's mystery property in Boone.
- But why would he just quit?

08:48.930 --> 08:52.380
With all that's going on,
Neil's who you're worried about?

08:57.572 --> 08:59.372
Okay, look, I'm sorry.

08:59.440 --> 09:03.191
Everything's bad,
and it just keeps getting worse.

09:04.069 --> 09:08.098
So, Kate was paying the
mortgage for a J. Cameron?

09:08.108 --> 09:09.983
And you have no idea who that is?

09:10.051 --> 09:12.253
Something else she was keeping from me.

09:12.263 --> 09:13.663
I checked her phone bill.

09:13.731 --> 09:16.433
She... she made two calls to an
unregistered number in Boone.

09:16.501 --> 09:18.731
Well, she did grow up there.
I'm sure she knows someone.

09:18.741 --> 09:21.171
No. Kate left Boone years
ago after her parents died.

09:21.239 --> 09:23.928
She had no living relatives and
never mentioned any friends...

09:23.938 --> 09:26.443
To be fair, she didn't
mention a lot of things.

09:27.864 --> 09:30.418
As long as I'm being Captain
Obvious, did you call the number?

09:30.428 --> 09:32.234
Yes, dumbass. I got a woman, okay?

09:32.302 --> 09:34.203
She said she never heard of Kate Warner

09:34.270 --> 09:35.904
or her maiden name... Martin.

09:35.972 --> 09:38.407
But I think she was lying.

09:38.475 --> 09:40.609
Why would she lie about that?

09:40.677 --> 09:44.446
I think Kate could have been in
contact with the extortionist.

09:44.514 --> 09:47.649
Okay.

09:47.659 --> 09:50.542
I think you're ready
for a tinfoil hat, man.

09:50.552 --> 09:52.238
Listen.

09:52.988 --> 09:54.601
Kate made the first call to Boone

09:54.611 --> 09:57.958
the day before she took
$100.000 out of my savings.

09:58.026 --> 10:01.422
The second call came two days later.

10:01.432 --> 10:04.231
All right, so, what are
you gonna do about it?

10:04.299 --> 10:06.153
I'm going to Boone.

10:06.602 --> 10:08.335
I need answers.

10:09.499 --> 10:10.891
I'm going with you.

10:10.901 --> 10:13.903
Look, you need to roll deep in
case that scary cop shows up.

10:13.970 --> 10:15.448
Why would Cornell go to Boone?

10:15.458 --> 10:17.873
Not her. The...
the one that beat up Neil.

10:17.941 --> 10:20.142
- He's a cop?
- I didn't tell you that.

10:20.152 --> 10:23.245
Yeah, Neil must have let it slip.

10:23.255 --> 10:25.447
What else did Neil let slip, Patrick?

10:25.457 --> 10:27.217
That's it.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.918
I mean, you... you kind of interrupted.

10:28.985 --> 10:30.786
Wait, is the cop working with Cornell?

10:32.898 --> 10:36.488
Badge says NYPD, but Danny's
not the problem, okay?

10:36.498 --> 10:39.834
He's just looking for this girl,
Carly, who was at our party.

10:39.902 --> 10:43.214
Well, I'm gonna look into him
and see what his story is.

10:43.646 --> 10:45.399
You guys be careful.

10:45.409 --> 10:48.147
The outskirts of Boone
can be pretty backwoods.

10:48.157 --> 10:51.512
We... we talking honey
boo boo or swamp people?

10:51.580 --> 10:53.214
Both.

10:54.983 --> 10:56.651
Ooh.

11:02.157 --> 11:03.914
What am I looking at here?

11:03.924 --> 11:05.827
Some hot action for sale.

11:07.461 --> 11:09.429
So, even though Carly's
burner was disconnected,

11:09.497 --> 11:12.295
I used her phone number
to contact the provider,

11:12.305 --> 11:13.900
subpoena the call history,

11:13.910 --> 11:16.366
and that made it pretty
easy to figure out

11:16.376 --> 11:19.272
which escort service she worked for.

11:19.282 --> 11:22.876
Seems she ditched the burner but
didn't stop working for the service.

11:25.079 --> 11:29.115
Her specialty is lunch
at the Y for... $1.000.

11:29.125 --> 11:32.052
To give or to receive?

11:40.891 --> 11:43.026
Hey, plaid shirt.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.260
You must be Norman.

11:44.328 --> 11:47.130
Yeah, that's, um... that's me.

11:50.225 --> 11:52.074
Are you ready for our date?

11:52.084 --> 11:53.636
Yeah.

11:54.538 --> 11:55.705
I've, um...

11:56.596 --> 11:58.473
I've, um...

11:58.483 --> 12:00.350
I've... I've never done this before.

12:00.360 --> 12:02.178
Well, don't worry.

12:02.246 --> 12:05.782
I don't bite. Un-unless you want me to.

12:10.254 --> 12:13.291
Listen, you... you seem nice.

12:13.301 --> 12:16.759
But, since we've
never dated before...

12:18.791 --> 12:22.421
I'm gonna need the money up front, okay?

12:22.535 --> 12:24.773
Sure. Yeah. Okay.

12:25.954 --> 12:30.891
What exactly do...
do I do I get... for my money?

12:32.336 --> 12:35.772
Well, you get a girlfriend for the day.

12:37.574 --> 12:39.409
And unlike your real one,

12:39.476 --> 12:42.979
I'll make sure I do
everything in my power

12:43.047 --> 12:45.481
to make you happy.

12:45.549 --> 12:47.583
So, are you ready?

12:47.593 --> 12:50.276
It's just... I made
the call for a friend.

12:50.286 --> 12:52.955
What? Who?

12:53.023 --> 12:55.578
That would be me.

12:55.588 --> 12:57.860
You have the right to remain silent.

12:58.555 --> 13:00.663
Anything you say can and will be used...

13:00.731 --> 13:02.565
Yeah, I know the drill.

13:02.575 --> 13:03.957
In a court of law.

13:03.967 --> 13:06.969
You have the right to an attorney.

13:35.604 --> 13:37.736
That was definitely entrapment.

13:37.746 --> 13:40.014
Carly, I'm murder police.

13:40.082 --> 13:43.922
I have no interest in
a solicitation bust.

13:45.296 --> 13:46.565
Okay.

13:47.886 --> 13:49.590
So, what do you want?

13:49.658 --> 13:51.965
I want to talk to you
about a party you attended

13:51.975 --> 13:53.627
at Sherwood equity group.

13:53.637 --> 13:55.529
I go to lots of parties.

14:02.771 --> 14:06.907
Okay, so, maybe I was wrong
about the entrapment thing.

14:06.975 --> 14:10.908
You were with Neil Oliver
on two occasions, correct?

14:10.918 --> 14:12.185
He's a client.

14:12.253 --> 14:15.388
And if you think about, I'm in sales.

14:15.456 --> 14:17.123
I understand.

14:17.191 --> 14:18.859
A girl's got to eat.

14:18.926 --> 14:21.626
Do you recognize anybody
else in the photo?

14:22.932 --> 14:24.104
No.

14:25.800 --> 14:28.684
I'm trying to make this
quick and painless.

14:28.694 --> 14:31.362
If you don't want to cooperate,
my hands are tied.

14:31.430 --> 14:33.264
I'm telling the truth.

14:33.332 --> 14:37.702
When I'm with a man,
I'm paid to make him feel special.

14:37.770 --> 14:39.704
I don't notice anyone else.

14:39.772 --> 14:41.558
And the night of the party?

14:41.568 --> 14:43.461
Did you make Neil feel special?

14:43.471 --> 14:46.010
In his car. He wasn't half bad.

14:47.109 --> 14:50.513
And this woman was at both events.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.515
Did you notice or talk to her?

14:52.525 --> 14:55.449
That's the chick they
scraped off the sidewalk.

14:55.459 --> 14:58.187
No. I've never seen her before.

14:58.255 --> 15:00.756
Then how do you know she went
off the side of the building?

15:00.824 --> 15:03.059
It was in the news.

15:03.445 --> 15:06.391
Look, you obviously
wanted to check Neil's alibi,

15:06.401 --> 15:08.302
and I told you where he was.

15:08.370 --> 15:09.570
Can I go?

15:09.638 --> 15:11.087
No.

15:12.340 --> 15:14.775
You said you didn't care
about solicitation.

15:14.843 --> 15:17.349
I guess we're both accomplished liars.

15:17.359 --> 15:20.726
Your bedside manner sucks.

15:21.977 --> 15:24.385
Depends on the bed.

15:30.992 --> 15:32.960
Hey, honey.

15:35.553 --> 15:38.056
Why are you here?

15:38.066 --> 15:39.567
I brought some snacks for the boys.

15:39.635 --> 15:41.836
- It's a long drive.
- Thank you.

15:41.903 --> 15:42.903
Unh, unh, unh.

15:42.971 --> 15:44.851
Give me that. Nope, nope, nope.

15:44.861 --> 15:47.433
You need to focus if you're going
to watch your brother's back.

15:47.443 --> 15:49.036
That's cruel and unusual punishment.

15:49.046 --> 15:51.729
No worse than being married to her.

15:57.521 --> 15:59.756
Okay, he's going to Boone, not Iraq.

15:59.824 --> 16:01.291
Okay, you know what, Amanda?

16:01.359 --> 16:04.494
Affection is key to a
successful marriage.

16:04.562 --> 16:06.630
Silly me.

16:06.697 --> 16:09.597
You're single now, right?
Is that what I heard?

16:10.735 --> 16:12.969
Um...

16:13.037 --> 16:15.538
W-we should hit the road, right, Eric?

16:15.606 --> 16:17.204
Yep. All right.

16:17.214 --> 16:19.075
Yeah, honey?

16:24.420 --> 16:26.917
I told Patrick that you and Greg split

16:26.927 --> 16:28.961
so he wouldn't say something
stupid and make it worse.

16:29.029 --> 16:32.698
I should have known that
he would tell Melanie.

16:32.708 --> 16:35.301
I-I'm sorry.

16:35.369 --> 16:37.870
I just wasn't ready for
anyone else to know.

16:37.938 --> 16:40.239
- I know.
- Especially not her.

16:40.307 --> 16:41.471
I know, but you know what?

16:41.481 --> 16:44.944
We... we really have too many
secrets in this family, Amanda.

16:44.954 --> 16:48.581
Way too many secrets. It's... it's
just unhealthy, and it's got to stop.

17:03.997 --> 17:07.433
We are now officially
out of our element.

17:09.835 --> 17:11.231
I've got one.

17:11.299 --> 17:13.567
You know you're backwoods

17:13.634 --> 17:16.770
when a full tank of gas
doubles the value of your car.

17:20.974 --> 17:23.676
So, tell me about that New York cop.

17:23.744 --> 17:26.880
I don't know much about him.

17:26.948 --> 17:29.930
I mean, like, what is his endgame?

17:32.153 --> 17:35.455
Whatever it is, he's not
gonna tell me the truth.

17:35.523 --> 17:38.945
W-why do you think
Cornell used him, though?

17:39.685 --> 17:41.632
I have no idea.

17:42.099 --> 17:45.454
Maybe she's trying to set me up.

17:45.464 --> 17:47.198
Who knows?

17:47.266 --> 17:49.668
Why is he looking for that girl?

17:49.735 --> 17:51.703
Why are you so obsessed with the guy?

17:52.772 --> 17:55.256
I'm... I'm just making conversation.

18:12.792 --> 18:15.819
I think I hear them
slaughtering the spring lambs.

18:15.829 --> 18:17.797
Are you sure this is the place?

18:17.865 --> 18:20.199
Same address as on the mortgage bill.

18:21.702 --> 18:23.803
All right. The city of Boone, I get.

18:23.871 --> 18:25.364
It's a college town, right?

18:25.374 --> 18:28.524
But who the hell is gonna
live all the way out here?

18:41.188 --> 18:43.289
I've been waiting for
you to come knocking.

18:44.244 --> 18:45.625
How do you know Kate Warner?

18:45.692 --> 18:47.326
You mean Kate Martin?

18:47.394 --> 18:49.046
That's her maiden name.

18:49.143 --> 18:51.230
So, how do you know her?

18:51.298 --> 18:53.266
She's my daughter.

19:02.828 --> 19:05.259
So, she married you.

19:10.803 --> 19:12.665
Why would Kate tell me you were dead?

19:12.732 --> 19:15.978
- I don't know why she would...
- So, you two weren't close.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.204
What do you think?
Kate left when she was 16.

19:18.271 --> 19:19.558
We haven't spoken since.

19:19.568 --> 19:20.835
Why are you asking all these questions?

19:20.903 --> 19:23.260
Did you know Kate paid your mortgage?

19:23.647 --> 19:24.916
No.

19:25.515 --> 19:28.009
Makes sense now, though.

19:29.311 --> 19:31.746
- Why is that?
- Bank's been chasing me for a year,

19:31.814 --> 19:33.851
and finally, the calls
stopped a few weeks ago.

19:33.861 --> 19:35.666
I figured they were done
trying to get money

19:35.676 --> 19:36.957
and eviction was next.

19:37.025 --> 19:41.295
That's who I thought you
were... process servers.

19:41.363 --> 19:43.798
Look, if Kate wants me to pay her back,

19:43.865 --> 19:45.905
you tell her to call me.
I'm no freeloader.

19:45.915 --> 19:49.036
We can figure out a payment
plan when I find work.

19:52.825 --> 19:54.608
Um, can we come in?

19:55.011 --> 19:57.478
There's something we need to tell you.

19:59.138 --> 20:00.481
Yeah.

20:11.871 --> 20:13.661
Counselor.

20:17.351 --> 20:18.413
What do you want?

20:18.423 --> 20:20.096
I'm investigating a murder.

20:20.106 --> 20:21.206
I am aware of that.

20:21.274 --> 20:23.074
I already gave you my statement.

20:23.142 --> 20:25.410
And now I need your outfit
from the night of the party.

20:25.478 --> 20:28.079
You've defended enough killers to know

20:28.147 --> 20:31.250
I'll be asking all key witnesses
to provide their garments.

20:31.260 --> 20:34.471
I see. Now that you have,
shifted your focus from my brother,

20:34.481 --> 20:36.482
you are grasping at straws.

20:36.550 --> 20:38.484
I'm casting a wider net.

20:38.552 --> 20:41.754
Detective, I did not kill Kate.

20:43.705 --> 20:45.306
I loved her.

20:46.487 --> 20:48.561
- You didn't.
- I shouldn't have.

20:48.629 --> 20:51.064
And I never will again.

20:51.131 --> 20:53.232
Okay, maybe one more time.

20:53.300 --> 20:55.253
You said, and I quote,

20:55.263 --> 20:58.804
"he's the guy who you never,
ever, ever sleep with

20:58.814 --> 21:01.343
because you will wake up crushed
under a mountain of regret."

21:01.353 --> 21:02.886
And shame.

21:02.954 --> 21:05.055
- Don't forget shame.
- Right.

21:06.358 --> 21:08.292
But it was really, really good.

21:08.360 --> 21:10.627
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:10.695 --> 21:11.762
Wow.

21:11.830 --> 21:15.399
Look, don't judge me.
I feel really ridiculous.

21:15.467 --> 21:17.501
I'm not judging.

21:17.569 --> 21:18.502
You are.

21:18.570 --> 21:20.090
You... you have restraint.

21:20.100 --> 21:22.266
You're really kind of perfect, actually.

21:22.276 --> 21:24.141
No, I-I'm not perfect.

21:26.067 --> 21:29.899
Okay, I-I'm not...
I'm not proud of this.

21:29.909 --> 21:30.976
When I was younger...

21:31.043 --> 21:33.078
There was this... there was this guy

21:33.145 --> 21:35.013
that I-I really wanted,

21:35.081 --> 21:37.916
but he was about to propose
to someone else, and I...

21:37.984 --> 21:39.618
I went for him anyway.

21:40.904 --> 21:43.435
- Did you get him?
- I did.

21:44.853 --> 21:46.287
But it was wrong.

21:46.354 --> 21:49.456
You know, I was young. I-I
wanted what I wanted at the time.

21:49.524 --> 21:52.114
I didn't care who I was hurting.

21:52.124 --> 21:53.327
My god.

21:53.337 --> 21:55.262
You're totally flawed.

21:56.998 --> 21:59.166
I am so relieved.

22:02.937 --> 22:04.404
I don't know why I told you that.

22:04.414 --> 22:07.407
Well, a lot of people tell me
things they don't want me to know.

22:07.474 --> 22:09.642
I still need your outfit.

22:09.710 --> 22:11.444
All right. Fine.
But it's been dry-cleaned.

22:11.512 --> 22:13.302
You don't know what I'm looking for.

22:14.615 --> 22:18.384
I will get it to you right away.
With Eric's juvenile record.

22:18.452 --> 22:20.981
My father has that,
and he is out of town.

22:20.991 --> 22:22.514
You will get it when he returns.

22:22.524 --> 22:25.158
Is he in Boone with your brothers?

22:25.226 --> 22:27.293
- No.
- Where is he?

22:27.303 --> 22:29.597
I don't know. Business meetings.

22:29.607 --> 22:31.064
Is that all?

22:41.239 --> 22:44.589
Never thought for a second I
wouldn't see my baby again.

22:45.803 --> 22:48.651
You said you hadn't
talked to Kate in years.

22:48.661 --> 22:49.928
Are you sure about that?

22:49.996 --> 22:53.421
- Yes. Why do you keep asking me?
- Because I think you did.

22:53.431 --> 22:55.066
And she told you things about my brother

22:55.076 --> 22:57.606
that you used as ammunition
for blackmailing him.

22:57.616 --> 22:58.910
Who do you think you are?

22:58.920 --> 23:02.307
You come into my house and tell
me that my daughter is dead,

23:02.317 --> 23:03.654
and then you accuse me of that.

23:03.664 --> 23:05.577
It isn't just an accusation.

23:05.587 --> 23:07.940
Kate called you, twice.

23:17.785 --> 23:19.788
Yeah, that isn't my number. It's Jake's.

23:19.798 --> 23:23.083
- Who is Jake?
- An old boyfriend.

23:23.093 --> 23:24.293
Did... did they...

23:24.361 --> 23:25.928
Did they date a long time?

23:25.996 --> 23:27.897
Jake wasn't her boyfriend. He was mine.

23:27.964 --> 23:30.776
Why would Kate want to talk
to an old boyfriend of yours?

23:30.786 --> 23:32.735
Maybe she still had a thing for him.

23:32.802 --> 23:34.697
I-I'm so confused.

23:34.707 --> 23:36.362
Well, let me spell it out, college boy.

23:36.372 --> 23:39.808
Jake was mine until Kate stole him away.

23:39.876 --> 23:42.921
No. No, you said Kate
left when she was 16.

23:42.931 --> 23:44.531
You think a 16-year-old

23:44.599 --> 23:47.200
can't wag her ass when she wants to?

23:47.268 --> 23:49.024
I did plenty for that girl.

23:49.034 --> 23:52.002
Being a single mom and the
sacrifices you make...

23:52.070 --> 23:54.038
And she took away the only thing

23:54.105 --> 23:55.606
I ever really loved.

23:57.663 --> 24:00.650
Wait, so your boyfriend...

24:01.690 --> 24:04.815
Was he the father of Kate's baby?

24:04.883 --> 24:07.061
- It's time for you to go.
- Is that why she left town?

24:07.071 --> 24:09.186
It's none of your business.

24:09.254 --> 24:11.980
I'm her husband.

24:13.463 --> 24:14.858
She's dead.

24:14.868 --> 24:18.596
If your wife wanted you to know,
she would've told you.

24:20.083 --> 24:21.298
Get out.

24:22.067 --> 24:23.567
Get out!

24:31.443 --> 24:33.388
Just got the final report
on the non-core witnesses

24:33.398 --> 24:35.099
the night your victim pancaked.

24:35.166 --> 24:36.267
Anything interesting?

24:36.334 --> 24:37.701
The usual crap.

24:37.769 --> 24:40.004
Everybody's got an opinion,
nobody saw anything workable.

24:40.071 --> 24:42.606
Guys in the tech division
showed me footage of a woman

24:42.674 --> 24:45.142
hesitating outside the building
a few hours before the murder,

24:45.210 --> 24:49.602
but, when I showed this
screen grab to witnesses,

24:49.612 --> 24:51.215
no one could I.D. her.

24:55.400 --> 24:56.635
Who's Ethan Barrett?

24:56.702 --> 24:58.537
Nobody. It's just...

24:59.937 --> 25:01.778
The Warners are the only ones
I haven't shown that to,

25:01.788 --> 25:03.308
so maybe one of them knows her?

25:03.376 --> 25:05.753
Do you know if she was entering
the building or leaving?

25:05.763 --> 25:08.310
It looked like she couldn't decide,
and then she went in.

25:08.320 --> 25:11.483
And I scanned the security footage
for her exit... I never saw her leave,

25:11.551 --> 25:13.461
which means she probably
left between 7:00 and 10:00

25:13.471 --> 25:14.605
when the footage was erased.

25:14.673 --> 25:16.273
So, she could've still
been in the building

25:16.341 --> 25:17.925
when Kate Warner was murdered.

25:17.935 --> 25:21.771
Do me a favor and go get me a
copy of the security footage.

25:21.839 --> 25:23.873
Anything else? Coffee? Tea?

25:32.785 --> 25:35.446
Let's think about this
for a second, okay? Please?

25:35.456 --> 25:38.021
You're not gonna run in there and
ruin your life right now, are you?

25:38.088 --> 25:39.889
Eric. Eric!

25:39.957 --> 25:41.457
Eric, you need to calm down, okay?

25:41.525 --> 25:42.725
You can stay in the car. You Jake?

25:42.793 --> 25:44.894
Hey. This is private property.

25:44.962 --> 25:46.329
What is it, hon?

25:46.339 --> 25:48.898
It's nothing. They're lost.

25:48.966 --> 25:50.682
Take the girls back inside.

25:50.692 --> 25:52.056
It's okay.

25:53.272 --> 25:56.239
Listen, I know why you're
here. Janice called.

25:56.307 --> 25:59.791
But Kate is in the past,
so we got nothing to talk about.

25:59.801 --> 26:01.878
How old were you?

26:03.461 --> 26:04.528
She was 16.

26:04.596 --> 26:06.763
How old were you?

26:06.831 --> 26:09.299
26, okay? But it was not like that.

26:09.367 --> 26:10.467
Like what? Like what?

26:10.535 --> 26:12.302
You don't understand the relationship.

26:12.370 --> 26:13.637
- Eric, let it go.
- Relationship?

26:13.705 --> 26:17.066
- You raped her!
- S-she wanted it just as bad.

26:24.076 --> 26:25.798
I'm okay.

26:25.808 --> 26:27.978
Can I just... can I have a minute?

26:28.046 --> 26:31.554
I heard what was said and
we will discuss it later.

26:35.554 --> 26:37.888
All right.

26:39.591 --> 26:41.812
I am sorry for you loss,

26:41.822 --> 26:44.190
but what happened 20 years ago...

26:44.258 --> 26:46.859
It was mutual, all right?

26:46.927 --> 26:49.929
I mean, the age of consent
is 16, so it wasn't illegal.

26:49.997 --> 26:51.364
No, it was just wrong.

26:51.432 --> 26:54.202
You know, at the time,
I didn't see that.

26:54.212 --> 26:56.769
It's different now.
I have... I have daughters.

26:58.180 --> 27:01.519
You know, hard as it would've
been, I was the adult.

27:01.529 --> 27:03.431
I should've resisted.

27:04.013 --> 27:08.114
But I really did... care for her.

27:09.365 --> 27:11.488
Why did Kate call you?

27:11.735 --> 27:13.761
Was it about the baby?

27:13.771 --> 27:17.863
The first time was to see if
I still lived here, and...

27:17.873 --> 27:21.793
A few days later, she called
to say she was in town.

27:21.803 --> 27:23.830
She wanted to meet.

27:25.299 --> 27:27.166
She met with you?

27:28.471 --> 27:30.627
Look, I get that this must be weird,

27:30.637 --> 27:32.638
hearing from me after all these years.

27:32.706 --> 27:35.997
Yeah, I'm... I'm not
gonna pretend it isn't.

27:36.643 --> 27:38.043
You been to see your mama?

27:38.111 --> 27:40.846
I-I hear she's got financial troubles.

27:40.914 --> 27:45.384
No. No, you,
remember what that was like.

27:45.452 --> 27:46.793
I do.

27:47.181 --> 27:49.718
And I wish I could say
she was doing better.

27:49.728 --> 27:51.590
I stayed in touch to be polite...

27:51.658 --> 27:53.259
You know, small town and all...

27:54.155 --> 27:56.160
But God knows she's as angry as ever.

27:56.170 --> 27:58.697
Look, I'm... I'm not here to catch up.

27:59.543 --> 28:01.702
It's about the kid, right?

28:02.072 --> 28:04.014
When I left town with...

28:04.375 --> 28:07.080
With our baby, I was broke.

28:08.164 --> 28:09.459
I wanted him to have a better life.

28:09.469 --> 28:12.478
I had no choice but to
put him up for adoption.

28:13.722 --> 28:16.312
I should've done more.

28:17.942 --> 28:19.678
I'm so sorry.

28:19.688 --> 28:22.656
We all made mistakes in the past.

28:22.724 --> 28:24.625
I'm here about the present.

28:24.635 --> 28:26.837
I found the parents.

28:27.013 --> 28:29.163
I talked to them.

28:29.173 --> 28:31.641
Our son's name is Charlie.

28:35.870 --> 28:37.172
You speak to him?

28:37.182 --> 28:39.886
No, no. Not yet.

28:39.896 --> 28:44.722
The agency, they contacted him,
but he's away at school.

28:44.732 --> 28:47.500
So... so they're okay
with you meeting him?

28:47.568 --> 28:49.536
The dad, he seems receptive.

28:49.603 --> 28:51.576
The... the mom not as much.

28:51.586 --> 28:52.625
But I get that, you know?

28:52.635 --> 28:55.241
She raised him from
infancy when I couldn't.

28:57.641 --> 28:59.512
The dad, he, um...

29:01.350 --> 29:03.316
He gave me this.

29:07.028 --> 29:10.156
He's a beautiful kid, isn't he?

29:13.072 --> 29:14.776
If I do talk to Charlie,

29:14.786 --> 29:17.997
he'll probably ask who his father is.

29:20.098 --> 29:22.195
So can I tell him?

29:27.810 --> 29:28.978
What did you say?

29:29.045 --> 29:30.519
Told her "no."

29:30.529 --> 29:31.680
Wow.

29:35.118 --> 29:36.285
Kid's in college.

29:36.353 --> 29:37.786
He's... he's already
doing better than me.

29:37.854 --> 29:39.288
Well, what can I give him?

29:39.356 --> 29:41.090
You can give him answers.

29:50.797 --> 29:52.901
After that, I need therapy.

29:52.969 --> 29:55.337
More, you mean?

29:57.698 --> 29:59.679
What kind of mother cares
more about her boyfriend

29:59.689 --> 30:01.433
than her own kid?

30:01.501 --> 30:05.270
It's amazing that Kate turned
out the way that she did.

30:05.338 --> 30:07.139
I mean, the mom is something, for sure.

30:07.206 --> 30:10.408
But it's not like Kate is blameless.

30:10.476 --> 30:13.578
Did you card every chick
that you took home at 26?

30:13.646 --> 30:15.362
No.

30:15.785 --> 30:17.649
What's your point?

30:17.717 --> 30:19.956
He knew how old she was
and he did it anyway.

30:19.966 --> 30:21.319
Come on.

30:21.387 --> 30:23.795
I didn't know Mel at 16, but...

30:23.805 --> 30:25.624
I can bet that she put many a man

30:25.691 --> 30:27.886
into a don't-ask-don't-tell situation.

30:27.896 --> 30:30.741
Don't ever compare your wife to mine.

30:30.751 --> 30:33.356
After today, it looks like
they got a lot in common.

30:33.366 --> 30:35.901
They had nothing in common.

30:35.968 --> 30:38.606
Yeah, maybe you're right.

30:38.616 --> 30:41.032
Kate was always accepted.
Mel was treated like trash

30:41.042 --> 30:42.252
since the second
that she walked in the door.

30:42.320 --> 30:45.122
- We call it how we see it.
- God...

30:45.190 --> 30:49.465
I love that woman, and she is my wife,

30:49.475 --> 30:52.254
and I am sick of all of
you disrespecting her.

31:01.046 --> 31:02.948
I'm sorry, all right?

31:03.291 --> 31:05.036
I didn't mean to...

31:05.397 --> 31:08.506
I just think you see your wife

31:09.061 --> 31:10.981
the way you want to see her.

31:13.874 --> 31:15.458
You're right.

31:16.207 --> 31:19.723
And you wouldn't know anything
about doing that?

31:27.774 --> 31:28.966
Could you get me a beer?

31:28.976 --> 31:31.001
- Yeah.
- Please? Thank you.

31:31.661 --> 31:33.458
You were supposed to call me.

31:33.793 --> 31:37.150
And you were supposed to keep
the terms of our agreement.

31:37.160 --> 31:39.498
What, the Liam kid? I turned
him in to you like I promised.

31:39.508 --> 31:41.476
And then you bailed him out
so you could strong-arm him.

31:41.544 --> 31:42.777
I needed answers.

31:42.845 --> 31:44.946
Your missing daughter doesn't not trump

31:45.014 --> 31:46.381
my murder investigation.

31:46.448 --> 31:49.484
To me it does.

31:49.552 --> 31:52.820
Okay, I failed Rachel before,
put others ahead of her...

31:52.888 --> 31:54.722
You know, other cops, the job.

31:54.790 --> 31:58.021
Show me a cop worth his salt who hasn't.

31:58.031 --> 31:59.331
You're not unique.

31:59.399 --> 32:02.201
Look, there's more to it than...

32:02.268 --> 32:05.076
My ego and a few missed birthdays.

32:07.017 --> 32:08.674
What the hell happened?

32:08.741 --> 32:09.908
Neighbors heard a shot.

32:09.976 --> 32:13.312
Uniforms responded and
found Detective Sommers.

32:14.614 --> 32:17.067
No, man! No!

32:18.885 --> 32:20.198
Mitch wouldn't, okay?

32:20.208 --> 32:22.321
This was staged. Somebody set this up.

32:23.803 --> 32:25.871
Suicide note's addressed to you.

32:28.288 --> 32:31.555
_

32:33.909 --> 32:35.981
Your partner abused your daughter?

32:36.049 --> 32:38.350
Since she was 13 years old.

32:38.418 --> 32:40.552
You know, I brought Mitch into her life,

32:40.620 --> 32:42.688
told her he was family.

32:42.756 --> 32:45.057
That's not your fault.

32:45.125 --> 32:48.093
Those types of predators,
they hide their sickness well.

32:48.161 --> 32:51.263
She trusted him
because I said he was okay.

32:51.331 --> 32:53.370
'Cause he had your back.
He was your partner.

32:53.380 --> 32:54.967
How could you have known?

32:55.528 --> 32:56.929
Here you go.

32:58.925 --> 33:02.615
Turns out one of the victims
came forward, then another...

33:02.625 --> 33:04.140
And he took the easy way out.

33:04.150 --> 33:06.212
'Cause he knew what you would do to him.

33:06.222 --> 33:07.519
I mean, I'm...

33:07.587 --> 33:09.955
No, I should have seen
the signs in Rachel...

33:10.023 --> 33:12.958
Depression, promiscuity.

33:17.637 --> 33:20.532
I have your daughter's
friend in custody.

33:21.056 --> 33:22.342
Okay.

33:22.352 --> 33:23.629
Look, I need to speak to her

33:23.639 --> 33:26.087
because she invited Rachel here
and she knows where she is.

33:26.097 --> 33:28.619
I'll get that information for you,

33:28.629 --> 33:30.330
but you need to stay out of sight

33:30.398 --> 33:31.898
and stay out of my investigation.

33:31.966 --> 33:33.133
We clear?

33:33.201 --> 33:35.268
Thank you, Detective.

33:35.336 --> 33:36.870
Thank you.

33:38.686 --> 33:40.545
Call me Andrea.

33:47.757 --> 33:49.816
- What do you need, Detective?
- Break out Carly Sinclair.

33:49.884 --> 33:51.808
I want to take her
back to the interview room.

33:51.896 --> 33:53.987
She was cited out an hour ago. Sorry.

33:54.055 --> 33:55.355
I had a hold on her.

33:55.423 --> 33:57.758
She's a witness
in my murder investigation.

33:57.825 --> 33:59.459
They said to kick her, and I did.

33:59.527 --> 34:01.119
That stuff's above my pay grade.

34:01.129 --> 34:03.092
Who ordered her release?

34:03.656 --> 34:05.726
That's above your pay grade.

34:14.319 --> 34:16.735
After seeing what Kate went through,

34:16.916 --> 34:18.516
I guess we should count our blessings...

34:21.817 --> 34:23.251
'cause we were raised better than that.

34:23.319 --> 34:24.619
You serious?

34:24.687 --> 34:25.719
What?

34:27.119 --> 34:30.422
It was different, not better.

34:30.433 --> 34:32.367
It wasn't that bad.

34:32.435 --> 34:36.103
Every time Dad went away, Mom
turned into a bitter, drunken bully.

34:36.172 --> 34:37.472
It wasn't every single time.

34:37.540 --> 34:39.206
Every time, Patrick.

34:39.275 --> 34:41.275
You were terrified of her.

34:44.847 --> 34:46.715
It wasn't like she had it easy.

34:46.783 --> 34:49.484
I mean, there were three of us,
Dad was always away.

34:49.552 --> 34:52.754
You were too young to remember
or you blocked it out.

34:54.849 --> 34:56.752
It was bad.

34:57.226 --> 34:58.760
Ask Mandy.

35:08.753 --> 35:10.388
Hey, I know it wasn't much fun,

35:10.456 --> 35:14.725
but...I appreciate
you coming with me.

35:14.793 --> 35:16.527
Burger was good.

35:22.396 --> 35:23.901
You know, I thought we'd get answers.

35:24.970 --> 35:28.333
Well, we kind of did,
just not to the pressing questions.

35:28.343 --> 35:29.409
It wasn't a total loss.

35:29.477 --> 35:33.113
You got to meet your mother-in-law.

35:33.181 --> 35:35.649
And we haven't done a
road trip in a while.

35:35.717 --> 35:37.984
Even if we did fight half the day.

35:38.766 --> 35:41.788
Even if I'm mad at you,
I still love you, bro.

35:41.798 --> 35:44.057
Thanks, man.

35:44.067 --> 35:47.427
If it wasn't for you and Mandy,
I don't know what I'd do.

35:47.495 --> 35:48.723
And Dad.

35:48.943 --> 35:50.731
I know you guys are kind
of fighting right now,

35:50.798 --> 35:52.432
but you should call him.

35:52.500 --> 35:55.000
Old man would walk through fire for you.

35:56.137 --> 35:57.504
But, if you're okay,

35:57.572 --> 36:01.174
I have a much needed cocktail
waiting for me at home.

36:02.343 --> 36:05.888
- What's he doing here?
- You want to keep driving?

36:05.898 --> 36:07.666
I can handle this. Go home.

36:07.734 --> 36:10.502
You sure? I can lay on the horn
till the neighbors come down.

36:10.570 --> 36:13.205
Is that something you learned in
your women's self-defense class?

36:13.272 --> 36:15.553
Yeah, Mel did.
But my lack of balls aside,

36:15.563 --> 36:18.165
it's a pretty good emergency
plan in this situation.

36:18.233 --> 36:20.367
I got this. Go home.

36:24.038 --> 36:25.822
I'm not in the mood.

36:25.832 --> 36:28.275
I'm sorry I lied to you,
but I need your help.

36:33.223 --> 36:36.383
Look, I divorced my
wife seven years ago.

36:36.451 --> 36:38.549
- At least she's alive.
- No, no.

36:38.559 --> 36:41.121
She died three years later.

36:41.253 --> 36:43.086
Cancer.

36:43.096 --> 36:44.597
Okay, my daughter is the only thing

36:44.607 --> 36:46.341
that I have left in the world.

36:46.409 --> 36:49.244
Without you, I won't
be able to find her.

36:49.312 --> 36:51.270
Just hear me out.

36:51.280 --> 36:53.448
Please.

36:57.877 --> 37:00.180
It's been a long day,
and I've got a lot on my mind,

37:00.248 --> 37:03.284
- so make it fast.
- Cornell arrested Carly earlier.

37:03.351 --> 37:05.286
Great. Isn't that what you wanted?

37:05.353 --> 37:07.254
Now she can tell you
where your daughter is...

37:07.322 --> 37:09.423
But before Cornell could find
out anything about Rachel,

37:09.491 --> 37:10.658
the cops released Carly.

37:10.725 --> 37:11.792
Why would they do that?

37:11.860 --> 37:14.528
Probably 'cause she serviced a few
key members of the Department.

37:14.596 --> 37:16.497
Carly could be in another state by now,

37:16.565 --> 37:20.050
so the only way that I'm gonna
get answers about my daughter

37:20.060 --> 37:21.592
is through your buddy Neil.

37:21.602 --> 37:25.755
He uses her services, man.
It's not like they hang out.

37:25.765 --> 37:28.732
Look, you think
if she was just some hooker

37:28.742 --> 37:31.010
that he'd invite her
to your office party?

37:31.078 --> 37:32.912
He had to be sure
she wasn't gonna embarrass him.

37:32.980 --> 37:34.714
Neil knows Carly better
than he's saying.

37:34.782 --> 37:36.215
- He's a proven liar.
- Look who's talking.

37:36.283 --> 37:37.750
Neil quit.

37:37.818 --> 37:39.252
Cornell thinks he didn't kill Kate,

37:39.320 --> 37:40.586
so it's really not my problem.

37:40.654 --> 37:43.022
Really? You find the bank
statement Liam told us about?

37:43.090 --> 37:45.525
Okay, the kid said that Neil
has something to do with it.

37:45.592 --> 37:47.560
It makes sense...
he's the one that went in

37:47.628 --> 37:49.028
and took it out of Kate's desk.

37:49.096 --> 37:52.729
And if Neil was doing
some shady financial crap

37:52.739 --> 37:55.001
- and Kate caught him...
- Everyone lies.

37:55.069 --> 37:59.372
Liam is a liar, so it makes sense
that he would stay true to form.

37:59.382 --> 38:03.028
Rachel was with Neil and
Carly in your firm's Scybox.

38:03.038 --> 38:08.043
Neil's my last connection
to my daughter.

38:08.053 --> 38:11.789
If he's gonna tell the
truth to anybody, it's you.

38:14.560 --> 38:17.762
Your wife is dead.

38:17.829 --> 38:20.264
I don't want that to
happen to my daughter.

38:34.898 --> 38:37.585
Patrick called me. Why is he here?

38:37.595 --> 38:39.530
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

38:39.597 --> 38:43.956
Your New York cop has a bench
warrant out for his arrest.

38:44.502 --> 38:48.272
You walked away mid-testimony
in a major narcotics case.

38:48.340 --> 38:50.307
He's just looking for his
missing daughter, Mandy.

38:50.375 --> 38:52.309
Or he's using her as an excuse

38:52.377 --> 38:54.311
because he was paid to throw the trial.

38:54.379 --> 38:56.914
- You know my record is spotless. I...
- Save it.

38:56.981 --> 39:00.751
I have already contacted CMC PD
about you stalking my brother,

39:00.761 --> 39:03.520
and they know where you are right now.

39:06.019 --> 39:09.259
If I were you, I would leave
before the cops get here.

39:45.226 --> 39:46.762
We need to talk.

39:46.830 --> 39:48.631
Are you here to explain to me

39:48.698 --> 39:51.171
how my solicitation
suspect was released?

39:51.181 --> 39:52.369
What are you talking about?

39:52.379 --> 39:53.867
Too many eyes went to the floor

39:53.877 --> 39:56.311
when I walked her through this bullpen.

39:57.034 --> 39:59.081
- Who are you accusing?
- You tell me.

39:59.149 --> 40:01.917
Somebody's getting kickbacks
from the escort service

40:01.985 --> 40:04.853
or favors directly from her.

40:04.921 --> 40:08.023
I got a call from Amanda Warner.

40:08.091 --> 40:11.193
I know about the New York cop
you're using as an informant.

40:11.261 --> 40:14.696
- What the hell were you thinking?
- He's looking for his runaway daughter.

40:14.764 --> 40:17.032
I've never known you to
give a damn about anything

40:17.100 --> 40:18.734
if it didn't relate to a
case you're working on.

40:18.802 --> 40:20.736
If you were concerned
about your daughter,

40:20.804 --> 40:23.368
wouldn't you let a drug dealer walk?

40:23.378 --> 40:25.078
I don't have a daughter.

40:26.685 --> 40:29.945
And it's no secret that you
put the job before yours.

40:30.013 --> 40:31.649
So we both know that this is more about

40:31.659 --> 40:33.094
the information the guy's feeding you

40:33.104 --> 40:35.468
than any concern you
have for his daughter.

40:35.478 --> 40:38.702
My personal life is off limits to you.

40:38.712 --> 40:41.221
He wants his daughter. I want my killer.

40:41.231 --> 40:43.065
The relationship has worked out so far.

40:43.075 --> 40:46.335
I don't give a crap about
the deal you made with him.

40:46.403 --> 40:49.639
I put you on this case because you're
the best detective in this unit.

40:49.706 --> 40:54.811
I put my trust in you, and so far,
I've only gotten grief.

40:54.821 --> 40:58.481
If you want me to close this
case, then let me work.

40:58.549 --> 41:00.516
You work for me.

41:00.584 --> 41:03.419
You broke protocol and probably the law.

41:03.429 --> 41:06.923
And if the NYPD brass gets wind of
the fact that you've been harboring

41:06.990 --> 41:08.858
one of their detectives as a fugitive,

41:08.868 --> 41:11.427
holy hell will rain down
on this department.

41:11.495 --> 41:13.394
Both our jobs are on the line,

41:13.404 --> 41:15.963
and I will not take a bullet for you.

41:15.973 --> 41:18.901
- I-I didn't ask you to.
- Forget the case.

41:18.911 --> 41:21.859
Either place that cop under
arrest or you're suspended.

41:21.869 --> 41:23.840
Am I clear?
