08:31.011 --> 08:34.381

FOR ALL OF THIS,

08:34.381 --> 08:36.817

09:49.657 --> 09:50.658
PULL THE BRAKE UP!

09:50.658 --> 09:51.792
- I'M TRYING TO BRAKE UP!

09:51.792 --> 09:53.060
- WE GOT TO BRAKE UP!

09:53.060 --> 09:54.662
[tires squeal]

09:58.666 --> 10:01.635
I THINK WE JUST BROKE UP.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.871
- HOW TO BRAKE.

10:03.871 --> 10:06.239
[cat yelps]

10:06.239 --> 10:08.909
- THINK I'M GETTING
THE HANG OF IT.

10:08.909 --> 10:11.078
- SO I'VE BEEN TRYING TO IMAGINE
HOW THIS THING ENDS,

10:11.078 --> 10:12.512
AND HERE'S WHAT I GOT.

10:12.512 --> 10:14.581
LUCY GETS ON THE BIKE,
YOU ADMIT YOU CAN'T RIDE,

10:14.581 --> 10:16.149
SHE LAUGHS,
DOESN'T KISS YOU,

10:16.149 --> 10:18.418
AND THEN MY MOM KILLS YOU
FOR BUYING A MOTORCYCLE.

10:18.418 --> 10:21.288
OR YOU ACTUALLY GO FOR A RIDE,
YOU CRASH,

10:21.288 --> 10:22.723
SHE SLAPS YOU FOR LYING,

10:22.723 --> 10:25.058
WHILE ON THE GROUND BADGERS
ARRIVE AND EAT YOUR JACKET,

10:25.058 --> 10:28.328
AND THEN MY MOM KILLS YOU
FOR BUYING A MOTORCYCLE.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.063
- NOT LYING,
PRE-TRUTHS,

10:30.063 --> 10:31.999
BECAUSE I STILL HAVE TIME
TO LEARN.

10:31.999 --> 10:33.901
- WRONG AGAIN, BECAUSE IT'S BEEN
TWO HOURS,

10:33.901 --> 10:35.803
AND HERE COMES LUCY.

10:35.803 --> 10:36.737
- WAIT. WHAT?

10:38.806 --> 10:39.973
- HEY.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.441
I'M READY FOR THAT RIDE.

10:41.441 --> 10:44.978
- HEY.
YEAH, ABOUT THAT RIDE...

10:44.978 --> 10:46.714
- LET'S GO.

10:46.714 --> 10:48.115
- OKAY.

10:48.115 --> 10:49.549
[engine turns over]

10:49.549 --> 10:50.818
LET'S GO!

10:58.258 --> 11:00.728
[engine revving]

11:00.728 --> 11:02.796
- WELL, ARE WE GOING OR NOT?

11:02.796 --> 11:04.998
- UH, YEAH--
YEAH--NO, WE'RE GOING.

11:04.998 --> 11:08.368
I JUST--I NEED TO CHECK
THE THING AND, UH...

11:08.368 --> 11:09.369
[engine revs]

11:09.369 --> 11:10.738
- JAMES!

11:10.738 --> 11:14.141
THOSE MOTORCYCLE PARTS
YOU ORDERED JUST CAME.

11:14.141 --> 11:16.176
YOU KNOW, THE ONES
TO BORE THE HEADS

11:16.176 --> 11:20.413
AND INCREASE THE AIR FUEL MIX
FOR MAX HOG POWER?

11:20.413 --> 11:22.082
- OH, RIGHT!

11:22.082 --> 11:23.583
[engine stops]

11:23.583 --> 11:25.753
THOSE PARTS.

11:25.753 --> 11:28.121
- OH.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:28.121 --> 11:30.791
- SORRY, LADY LEATHER,
BUT YOU KNOW US BIKERS--

11:30.791 --> 11:32.359
ALWAYS CUSTOMIZING.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.094
SO I SUGGEST YOU WAIT
ON THAT RIDE.

11:34.094 --> 11:36.296
SO INSTEAD OF 3.7 SECONDS,

11:36.296 --> 11:41.334
I CAN TAKE YOU FROM ZERO
TO THRILL IN 1.5.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.636
- A MAN WHO'S GOOD WITH TOOLS.

11:43.636 --> 11:45.873
OKAY, MR. DIAMOND.

11:45.873 --> 11:47.407
I WILL WAIT FOR THAT RIDE.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.111
- WHOO!

11:51.111 --> 11:52.445
GOOD THING I ORDERED
THOSE PARTS.

11:52.445 --> 11:55.482
- IT'S EMPTY, GENIUS.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.284
- RIGHT.

11:57.284 --> 11:58.986
HEY, THANKS FOR SAVING ME.

11:58.986 --> 12:00.821
- I DIDN'T SAVE YOU.
I SAVED HER.

12:00.821 --> 12:03.056
AND EVERYONE ELSE OUT THERE
FROM YOU.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.192
AND I FIGURED OUT HOW
THIS IS GONNA END.

12:05.192 --> 12:07.127
YOU TELL LUCY YOU HAD TO SELL
THE BIKE

12:07.127 --> 12:08.295
BECAUSE MOM WOULD KILL YOU

12:08.295 --> 12:11.799
IF SHE FOUND OUT
YOU BOUGHT A MOTORCYCLE.

12:11.799 --> 12:13.400
- FINE.
I'LL SELL THE BIKE.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.237
PRE-TRUTH.

12:23.643 --> 12:27.815
- SO THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE JUST FRIENDS.

12:27.815 --> 12:31.218
- YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD.

12:34.487 --> 12:36.824
OH, SO WHAT ABOUT THAT MOVIE
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GO TO

12:36.824 --> 12:38.525
TOMORROW NIGHT?

12:38.525 --> 12:41.261
- UH, WELL, PEOPLE
WHO ARE JUST FRIENDS

12:41.261 --> 12:43.496
GO SEE MOVIES TOGETHER.

12:43.496 --> 12:45.232
HOW ABOUT WE ORDER
SEPARATE POPCORN?

12:45.232 --> 12:47.700
- AND I'LL PAY FOR MY TICKET.

12:47.700 --> 12:48.836
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:48.836 --> 12:51.939
THIS MIGHT BE THE BEST BREAKUP
EVER.

12:51.939 --> 12:54.041
- YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
JUST FRIENDS DO?

12:54.041 --> 12:55.308
- WHAT?

12:55.308 --> 12:57.110
- TEACH EACH OTHER HOW TO DRIVE
A STICK SHIFT

12:57.110 --> 13:00.380
SO ONE CAN GET A MOVIE ROLE
THAT'S NOT A TEEN ZOMBIE MOVIE.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.082
- OF COURSE.

13:02.082 --> 13:05.585
AND SINCE WE DON'T HAVE ALL THAT
BOYFRIEND/GIRLFRIEND PRESSURE,

13:05.585 --> 13:07.620
WE WON'T FIGHT.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.156
- NO FIGHTING.

13:09.156 --> 13:10.323
- TOLD YOU SO!

13:10.323 --> 13:11.624
- DOESN'T HELP ME WHEN YOU YELL!

13:11.624 --> 13:12.993
- STOP THE CAR!
- STOP IT!

13:12.993 --> 13:14.862
IT STOPPED.
- JUST DO IT.

13:14.862 --> 13:16.363
- AND IT'S GOING!

13:16.363 --> 13:18.498
YOU'RE THE WORST JUST FRIEND
EVER!

13:18.498 --> 13:19.967
- AH!

13:19.967 --> 13:21.969
- OKAY, AFTER THE BEAT,

13:21.969 --> 13:26.339
I NEED YOU GUYS TO GIVE ME
A "YEAH!"

13:26.339 --> 13:28.308
[metronome clicking]

13:28.308 --> 13:31.044
both:
YEAH.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.545
- OKAY, LIKE IT OR NOT,

13:32.545 --> 13:34.181
YOU ARE PROFESSIONALS,

13:34.181 --> 13:36.349
AND YOU HAVE A JOB.

13:36.349 --> 13:39.186
AND INSTEAD OF REFINISHING
AN OLD RED WAGON,

13:39.186 --> 13:42.890
WE NEED TO FINISH THIS ALBUM
AND GET READY TO GO ON TOUR

13:42.890 --> 13:44.757
ALL SUMMER LONG.

13:44.757 --> 13:46.226
GOT IT?

13:46.226 --> 13:47.594
- WE GOT IT.
WE GOT IT.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.296
- COUNT US DOWN.
WE'LL GET IT THIS TIME.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.568
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S TRY SOMETHING
DIFFERENT.

13:55.568 --> 13:58.038
AFTER THE BEAT,
I'LL GO TO THE BASEMENT,

13:58.038 --> 14:00.240
YOU'LL GET ME SOME COVERALLS
TOO,

14:00.240 --> 14:03.743
AND TOGETHER WE'LL FIX UP
YOUR STUPID WAGONIE.

14:03.743 --> 14:05.445
[metronome clicking]

14:05.445 --> 14:06.579
both:
YEAH!

14:12.119 --> 14:16.089
- YEAH, SOMEHOW I IMAGINED THIS
ENDING WAY WORSE THAN THIS.

14:18.158 --> 14:19.592
- IF YOU'VE GOT THAT
"FOR SALE" SIGN,

14:19.592 --> 14:20.994
DON'T EVEN BRINGING IT OUT,
MISSY,

14:20.994 --> 14:22.062
BECAUSE THIS BIKER BOY--

14:22.062 --> 14:22.996
OW!

14:25.632 --> 14:27.767
WELL, THERE GOES MY ONLY SHOT

14:27.767 --> 14:29.169
AT GETTING A DATE WITH LUCY.

14:29.169 --> 14:31.271
- IF SHE DATES YOU,
IT SHOULD BE THE REAL JAMES--

14:31.271 --> 14:33.640
WHO CAN BE AMAZING,
BY THE WAY.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.709
NOT THE LYING BIKER JAMES
WHO'S A DANGER TO SOCIETY.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.345
- [humming]

14:38.345 --> 14:39.779
OOH!

14:39.779 --> 14:41.781
ARE YOU SELLING THE MOTORCYCLE?

14:41.781 --> 14:43.650
- YES.

14:43.650 --> 14:45.785
- GIVE US A SEC TO GET SOME CASH
FROM THE ATM.

14:45.785 --> 14:47.955
AND BY ATM, I MEAN
THE COIN-FILLED PILLOWCASE

14:47.955 --> 14:49.222
UNDER MY HAMMOCK.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.295
- OH.
HEY, JAMES.

14:55.295 --> 14:58.131
SO I WAS THINKING ABOUT
THAT RIDE.

14:58.131 --> 15:01.101
- HEY, LUCY, ABOUT THAT RIDE...

15:01.101 --> 15:03.203
- INSTEAD OF JUST GOING
FOR A RIDE,

15:03.203 --> 15:07.840
MAYBE YOU COULD, I DON'T KNOW,
TAKE ME ON A DATE ON IT.

15:09.576 --> 15:10.743
- A DATE?

15:10.743 --> 15:11.744
- YEAH.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.313
YOU CAN DRIVE ME ON THE BIKE.

15:13.313 --> 15:14.781
MEET YOU AT YOUR PLACE AT 7:00?

15:18.385 --> 15:19.686
- OH, I'LL BE THERE.

15:23.856 --> 15:25.158
I CAN FEEL YOU GLARING AT ME,

15:25.158 --> 15:26.426
AND IT'S NOT HELPING.

15:26.426 --> 15:30.397
- [grunting]

15:30.397 --> 15:32.399
THERE YOU GO.
ONE MOTORCYCLE PLEASE.

15:32.399 --> 15:35.168
- THE BIKE ISN'T FOR SALE
ANYMORE.

15:42.309 --> 15:45.612
- WHY, THIS WAGON COULD BE
DYNO-MITE.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.247
[brassy musical flourish]

15:47.247 --> 15:48.648
OUT OF SIGHT.

15:48.648 --> 15:49.716
[brassy musical flourish]

15:49.716 --> 15:52.552
MAKE YOU FEEL ALL RIGHT.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.021
[brassy musical flourish]

15:54.021 --> 15:56.489
both:
WHY, IT'S WAGON LIGHTNING.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.091
[together]
* OH, OH, OH, OH

15:58.091 --> 15:59.326
* OH, OH, OH

16:01.028 --> 16:04.397
- YOU GUYS HAVE NO IDEA HOW ALL
OF THIS STUFF WORKS, DO YOU?

16:04.397 --> 16:08.101
- NOPE.
- GOT ANY SUGGESTIONS?

16:08.101 --> 16:11.038
[tools grinding and revving]

16:14.941 --> 16:17.410
[fanfare]

16:17.410 --> 16:18.611
[together]
WE DID IT!

16:18.611 --> 16:19.779
YEAH!

16:19.779 --> 16:21.748
- NO, I DID IT.

16:21.748 --> 16:24.817
YOU IDIOTS HAVE BEEN SINGING
FOR THE LAST TWO HOURS.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.319
- NEVER MIND THAT,
BECAUSE IT'S TIME

16:26.319 --> 16:29.056
TO TAKE THE RIDE OF OUR LIVES.

16:29.056 --> 16:32.092
- AND ALL IT'S MISSING
IS A DANGEROUS HILL.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.360
- BUT WE'RE IN THE HEART OF L.A.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.062
WHERE ARE WE GONNA FIND
A HILL?

16:35.062 --> 16:36.096
- DOWN SHIFT ON THE HILL.

16:36.096 --> 16:37.330
- WHAT'S DOWN SHIFTING?

16:37.330 --> 16:38.831
IT DOESN'T HELP ME
WHEN YOU YELL!

16:38.831 --> 16:40.733
- PULL ALONG THE BIG POLE!

16:40.733 --> 16:42.069
- OH, THAT POLE.

16:42.069 --> 16:43.070
- YOU'RE GONNA SCRATCH
GUSTAVO'S CAR.

16:43.070 --> 16:44.971
- OH, THERE'S A POLE THERE.
AH!

16:46.406 --> 16:48.841
- [chuckles]

16:48.841 --> 16:51.144
- YOU KNOW, THE MORE I THINK
ABOUT IT,

16:51.144 --> 16:53.746
THE MORE THIS SCRIPT STINKS.

16:53.746 --> 16:56.083
- DO THE ZOMBIE MOVIE.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.850
ZOMBIES DON'T DRIVE STICK.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.219
THEY EAT THEM.

16:59.219 --> 17:02.655
- [laughs]

17:02.655 --> 17:06.426
- HEY, UM, CAN I TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING?

17:06.426 --> 17:08.928
YOU KNOW, AS A FRIEND?

17:08.928 --> 17:11.798
- SURE.
WHAT'S UP, FRIEND?

17:11.798 --> 17:15.368
- WELL, I DATED THIS GIRL ONCE,

17:15.368 --> 17:17.237
AND WE BROKE UP,

17:17.237 --> 17:20.207
BUT I STILL LIKE HER.

17:20.207 --> 17:23.476
- OH, THAT'S A TOUGH ONE.

17:23.476 --> 17:26.413
WELL, AS YOUR FRIEND,

17:26.413 --> 17:29.216
I'D SAY IT WAS A REAL STUPID
MOVE LETTING EACH OTHER GO,

17:29.216 --> 17:33.186
AND YOU SHOULD MAYBE GO BACK OUT
WITH HER.

17:33.186 --> 17:36.189
[sentimental pop music]

17:36.189 --> 17:41.128
*

17:41.128 --> 17:42.962
- HEY, WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GET
OUT OF HERE

17:42.962 --> 17:46.166
AND GO ON A LITTLE "WE'RE BACK
TOGETHER" MILKSHAKE DATE?

17:46.166 --> 17:48.468
- I SAY, "LET'S GO."

17:48.468 --> 17:50.403
[engine turns over]

17:52.639 --> 17:54.974
- HEY, YOU'RE DOING IT.
YOU'RE DRIVING A STICK!

17:54.974 --> 17:58.411
- AND NOT A SCRATCH ON IT.

17:58.411 --> 18:01.214
- WE SHOULD BREAK UP MORE OFTEN!

18:01.214 --> 18:03.516
- NO!

18:03.516 --> 18:06.153
[knock on door]

18:06.153 --> 18:08.888
- HEY, MRS. KNIGHT.
I'M HERE TO MEET JAMES.

18:08.888 --> 18:10.490
- OH.

18:10.490 --> 18:11.858
- THEY'RE GOING ON A DATE.

18:11.858 --> 18:14.427
THEIR FIRST DATE.

18:14.427 --> 18:17.230
- WELL, COME IN.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.499
ALTHOUGH I'M NOT REALLY SURE
WHERE HE IS RIGHT NOW.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.334
- OH, I'M SURE HE'S JUST
A LITTLE NERVOUS

18:21.334 --> 18:23.736
BUT GETTING READY TO GET
THE BIG NIGHT IN GEAR.

18:27.174 --> 18:29.876
- ALL RIGHT, DIAMOND,
YOU GOT THIS.

18:29.876 --> 18:33.646
JUST, YOU KNOW, DRIVE AROUND
THE PARKING LOT A COUPLE TIMES

18:33.646 --> 18:36.649
AND THEN PICK UP LUCY.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.651
OKAY.

18:38.651 --> 18:41.053
[engine revving]

18:41.053 --> 18:42.555
NOW TO PUT IT IN GEAR...

18:50.363 --> 18:51.964
- [screams]

18:55.935 --> 18:58.104
- 7:00,
RIGHT ON TIME.

19:00.507 --> 19:03.910
- YEAH, THE DATE'S OFF.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.412
- I KNEW I COULDN'T HAVE
IMAGINED

19:05.412 --> 19:07.280
HOW BAD THIS IS GONNA END.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.882
I MEAN, WHO COULD
HAVE PREDICTED THIS?

19:09.882 --> 19:12.785
WE MUST HAVE GONE UP, WHAT,
TWO FLIGHTS OF STAIRS

19:12.785 --> 19:16.088
TO PULL THIS OFF?

19:16.088 --> 19:19.692
- I'M GONNA KILL HIM!

19:23.663 --> 19:26.466
- THIS IS NOT A HILL;
IT'S A PARKING GARAGE.

19:26.466 --> 19:28.235
- IT'S AN L.A. HILL.
NOW PUSH.

19:28.235 --> 19:29.402
- NO!

19:29.402 --> 19:30.870
THERE IS NO WAY YOU WILL MAKE
THAT TURN.

19:30.870 --> 19:35.542
- OH, YOU MEAN THE PARKING LOT
LAMP POLE PASS?

19:35.542 --> 19:37.277
- BESIDES,
CRASHING IS THE BEST PARK.

19:37.277 --> 19:39.312
- OKAY, ONE LAST RIDE,

19:39.312 --> 19:42.249
AND THEN WE ARE GOING BACK
IN THE RECORDING STUDIO.

19:42.249 --> 19:44.317
- YOU KNOW, WE'D GET THERE
A LOT FASTER IF YOU...

19:44.317 --> 19:45.585
both:
GIVE US A PUSH!

19:45.585 --> 19:47.954
- FINE.

19:47.954 --> 19:49.256
- CARLITOS, YOU READY?
- YEAH!

19:49.256 --> 19:51.524
- THREE, TWO, ONE.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.792
both:
BLAST OFF!

19:52.792 --> 19:54.461
- WHOO-HOO-HOO!
