[instrumental music]

00:43.583 --> 00:46.667
[indistinct chatter]

00:59.583 --> 01:00.708
Entil'Zha.

01:01.292 --> 01:02.750
Entil'Zha.

01:05.708 --> 01:08.125
I was sent
to find you.

01:08.208 --> 01:11.708
The ancient books
taught us that, on this day

01:11.792 --> 01:13.542
no sooner, no later

01:13.625 --> 01:17.333
we were to enter
the sanctuary and open this.

01:17.417 --> 01:20.417
We did not know
what was inside.

01:20.500 --> 01:21.917
It has waited

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
locked and sealed

01:24.083 --> 01:26.625
for over 900 years.

01:28.042 --> 01:31.875
We do not understand
how or why.

01:31.958 --> 01:34.333
We know only that it is.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.750
How did he know
that you would be here?

01:48.833 --> 01:50.792
How did he know your name?

01:54.125 --> 01:57.167
[dramatic music]

01:58.750 --> 02:01.000
Commander, we're picking up
a distress call.

02:01.083 --> 02:03.292
- Identify?
- I can't.

02:03.375 --> 02:04.875
It's not coming from a ship.

02:04.958 --> 02:08.083
There's no physical source
for the signal, just an area.

02:08.167 --> 02:10.000
- Sector 14.
- That's impossible.

02:10.083 --> 02:11.583
Sector 14's
been under quarantine

02:11.667 --> 02:13.000
for almost three years.

02:13.083 --> 02:15.750
That's where Babylon 4
disappeared.

02:15.833 --> 02:17.042
Let me hear it.

02:20.167 --> 02:21.625
(Ivanova on radio)
'They're coming through!'

02:21.708 --> 02:23.583
'Repeat,
they're coming through!'

02:23.667 --> 02:25.750
'This is Earth Alliance
Station Babylon 5.'

02:25.833 --> 02:27.250
'They're all over the place!'

02:27.333 --> 02:28.958
[explosion]

02:30.125 --> 02:31.750
Commander, that's your voice.

02:31.833 --> 02:32.917
It can't be.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.667
'Computer voice-scan
confirms it.'

02:34.750 --> 02:36.542
That's you.

02:36.625 --> 02:37.875
[Ivanova panting on radio]

02:37.958 --> 02:39.875
(Ivanova on radio)
'They're killing us!'

02:39.958 --> 02:41.958
'Can anyone hear me?'

02:42.042 --> 02:43.458
'They're killing us!'

02:46.667 --> 02:51.375
(Ivanova)
The Babylon project was
our last best hope for peace.

02:55.042 --> 02:56.375
It failed.

02:56.458 --> 02:59.500
[dramatic music]

03:11.500 --> 03:13.167
But in the year
of the Shadow War

03:13.250 --> 03:15.875
it became something greater.

03:15.958 --> 03:17.833
Our last best hope

03:17.917 --> 03:19.583
for victory.

03:23.917 --> 03:26.042
The year is 2260.

03:26.125 --> 03:29.042
The place, Babylon 5.

03:32.167 --> 03:35.208
[theme music]

04:14.750 --> 04:17.583
[instrumental music]

04:27.583 --> 04:29.583
Your ship is ready, Entil'Zha.

04:34.083 --> 04:36.417
'The letter seems
to have disturbed you.'

04:38.042 --> 04:39.917
Perhaps if you told me
what it says

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
I might be able--

04:41.083 --> 04:42.958
No.

04:43.042 --> 04:47.000
This was meant
for me alone.

04:47.083 --> 04:50.917
Tell the others to continue
their work in my absence.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.417
Nothing must interfere
with that.

04:53.500 --> 04:55.042
Yes, Entil'Zha.

04:55.125 --> 04:57.333
Thank you for everything
you've done, Rathenn.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.667
When I first came here

05:01.750 --> 05:04.708
I don't think anyone
really trusted me.

05:04.792 --> 05:06.875
You were the first.

05:06.958 --> 05:09.042
Where Delenn points

05:09.125 --> 05:10.125
I follow.

05:10.208 --> 05:13.333
She pointed to you.

05:13.417 --> 05:15.708
I have done nothing
worthy of praise.

05:15.792 --> 05:18.625
Well...with your help

05:18.708 --> 05:21.333
we've created something
bigger than we are.

05:21.417 --> 05:23.875
It has a life of its own.

05:23.958 --> 05:26.667
Come what may, the Rangers
will finish the work ahead.

05:29.625 --> 05:31.208
Take care, Rathenn.

05:32.208 --> 05:35.333
[instrumental music]

05:54.583 --> 05:56.750
I have the strangest feeling

05:56.833 --> 05:58.583
I will never see him again.

06:00.167 --> 06:04.167
He is the closed circle.

06:04.250 --> 06:06.792
He is returning
to the beginning.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.625
The beginning of what?

06:15.250 --> 06:18.375
[instrumental music]

06:20.083 --> 06:21.500
(Ivanova on radio)
'They're coming through!'

06:21.583 --> 06:23.292
'Repeat,
they're coming through!'

06:23.375 --> 06:25.667
'This is Earth Alliance
Station Babylon 5.'

06:25.750 --> 06:28.583
'They're all over the place!'

06:28.667 --> 06:30.042
'They're killing us!'

06:30.125 --> 06:31.875
'Can anyone hear me?'

06:31.958 --> 06:34.667
'They're killing us!'

06:34.750 --> 06:37.625
Computer analysis confirms
it matches your voice.

06:37.708 --> 06:40.333
It's a fake. I've never sent out
a distress call like that.

06:40.417 --> 06:43.375
Maybe you just haven't
sent it yet.

06:43.458 --> 06:45.167
The signal's coming
from Sector 14.

06:45.250 --> 06:47.083
That's where
Babylon 4 disappeared.

06:47.167 --> 06:48.458
Ever since it was yanked
through time

06:48.542 --> 06:49.583
to where ever the hell
it was going

06:49.667 --> 06:51.167
the area's been a mess.

06:51.250 --> 06:54.250
Time doesn't work right
in there.

06:54.333 --> 06:56.667
What if this signal
is from the future?

06:56.750 --> 06:59.333
Our future?

06:59.417 --> 07:01.083
When Babylon 4 reappeared
two years ago

07:01.167 --> 07:03.958
Commander Sinclair and I went
aboard to evacuate her crew.

07:04.042 --> 07:06.083
And while I was there,
I had this flash.

07:06.167 --> 07:07.958
I saw a fire fight
here on the station.

07:08.042 --> 07:10.667
Something was
invading Babylon 5.

07:10.750 --> 07:14.417
We were putting up
a pretty good fight, but..

07:14.500 --> 07:17.083
...we were losing.
Bad.

07:17.167 --> 07:19.208
So you think that's where
the signal's coming from?

07:19.292 --> 07:20.833
The fall of Babylon 5?

07:20.917 --> 07:22.833
'Sure sounds like it to me.'

07:22.917 --> 07:24.542
Captain, I'd like
to check it out.

07:24.625 --> 07:26.625
Aside from Sinclair, I've got
more personal experience

07:26.708 --> 07:28.167
with this stuff
than anybody else.

07:28.250 --> 07:31.208
Since he's not here,
that leaves it to me.

07:31.292 --> 07:33.500
If this really is
coming from the future

07:33.583 --> 07:37.167
maybe we can find out what's
gonna happen, prepare for it.

07:37.250 --> 07:38.167
Alright.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.208
I'll authorize it.

07:40.292 --> 07:42.042
It's a three-hour trip
in normal space

07:42.125 --> 07:44.708
so get your gear together and
leave as soon as you're ready.

07:44.792 --> 07:47.417
- Thanks.
- Okay, okay.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.583
Now, everybody
from the non-aligned worlds

07:49.667 --> 07:52.542
get in line so we can process
your IDs, thank you.

07:52.625 --> 07:55.375
If you're from one of the worlds
we don't have a treaty with yet,

07:55.458 --> 07:58.500
step over there and have
your travel papers ready.

07:58.583 --> 08:00.667
Thank you. Come on, move it
along. Move it along.

08:00.750 --> 08:03.000
Thank you.
Very good. Move it along.

08:03.083 --> 08:07.917
That's alright.
That's alright. Thank you.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.375
Commander Sinclair.

08:11.125 --> 08:13.208
Ambassador Sinclair now.

08:13.292 --> 08:16.458
Well, up until all hell
broke loose back home.

08:16.542 --> 08:17.875
It's Zack, isn't it?

08:17.958 --> 08:19.250
Yes, sir.

08:19.333 --> 08:22.292
I came aboard just before
you were promoted.

08:22.375 --> 08:24.083
It's good to see you
again, sir.

08:24.167 --> 08:26.083
Thank you.

08:26.167 --> 08:28.750
It's good
to be back.

08:28.833 --> 08:31.208
Will you be staying long?

08:31.292 --> 08:34.458
That's a far more interesting
question than you might suspect.

08:35.792 --> 08:37.083
Hmm.

08:37.167 --> 08:39.000
Yeah. Go on. Move along.

08:39.083 --> 08:41.250
So Ivanova, want me
to bring you back

08:41.333 --> 08:43.083
anything from the future?

08:43.167 --> 08:44.417
Some bagels? Fresh milk?

08:44.500 --> 08:47.000
'All crew must evacuate
launch bay.'

08:47.083 --> 08:49.500
How about the winning numbers
from the new Vegas lottery?

08:49.583 --> 08:51.542
I'll split it with you 50-50.

08:51.625 --> 08:54.083
Hah. 60-40,
you got a deal.

08:54.167 --> 08:55.292
Done and done.

08:55.375 --> 08:57.542
I'll see you
in about eight hours.

09:00.833 --> 09:03.875
[dramatic music]

09:07.958 --> 09:09.333
[door beeps]

09:09.875 --> 09:11.333
Come.

09:13.875 --> 09:16.792
Delenn, I..

09:16.875 --> 09:18.333
Delenn?

09:19.792 --> 09:21.042
Where are you?

09:21.125 --> 09:24.333
(Delenn)
'He's here,
isn't he?'

09:24.417 --> 09:25.708
Yes.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.750
Then it's time.

09:30.500 --> 09:32.708
We are grey.

09:32.792 --> 09:35.375
We stand
between the candle

09:35.458 --> 09:37.583
and the star.

09:39.750 --> 09:41.542
He is my friend,
Lennier.

09:42.667 --> 09:44.208
I know.

09:46.583 --> 09:50.500
But it must be done
or the dream will die

09:50.583 --> 09:54.167
and countless others
will die with it.

09:54.250 --> 09:56.708
I wish
I had more time.

09:56.792 --> 10:00.583
But now, time
is all we have.

10:06.250 --> 10:08.667
[instrumental music]

10:08.750 --> 10:12.625
We haven't had a Shadow attack
in nearly eight days.

10:12.708 --> 10:14.875
My guess is they're
reconsidering their strategy

10:14.958 --> 10:17.375
after the Vorlons
got involved.

10:17.458 --> 10:19.250
They're worried,
that means they'll hit us

10:19.333 --> 10:21.167
twice as hard
when they come back.

10:21.250 --> 10:24.667
Assuming a worst-case
scenario.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.542
The way things
have been going lately

10:26.625 --> 10:29.417
I've decided to start taking
Ivanova lessons.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.542
Captain, I'm sorry
to interrupt you

10:31.625 --> 10:34.042
but you must come with me to
the White Star at once.

10:34.125 --> 10:35.792
We were finishing up
something here--

10:35.875 --> 10:39.667
(Delenn)
'This cannot wait.
I'm sorry, Captain.'

10:39.750 --> 10:42.917
Marcus, we will need you
to come along as well.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Also Ivanova.

10:44.083 --> 10:46.667
And one other.

10:46.750 --> 10:47.875
Who?

10:47.958 --> 10:51.042
Well, looks like
I got here just in time.

10:52.292 --> 10:55.375
Captain Sheridan.
Jeffrey Sinclair.

10:55.458 --> 10:56.750
Good to see you again.

10:56.833 --> 10:59.417
I'll be. And you.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.500
I haven't seen you
since the Mars riots.

11:01.583 --> 11:04.208
- Hello, Marcus.
- Respects, Entil-zha.

11:04.292 --> 11:07.375
This is a surprise. I've heard a
lot about you since I got here.

11:07.458 --> 11:10.292
Same here. You've done a good
job looking after the place.

11:10.375 --> 11:12.750
I couldn't have
wished for better.

11:12.833 --> 11:13.833
Delenn, how did you know--

11:13.917 --> 11:15.125
[beeping]

11:15.208 --> 11:16.958
Never lets you finish
a sentence, does it?

11:17.042 --> 11:20.042
You noticed that, huh?
Sheridan. Go.

11:20.125 --> 11:23.292
Captain, we've got
Mr. Garibaldi on channel two.

11:23.375 --> 11:24.625
Put him through.

11:26.875 --> 11:28.250
Captain, I'm about two hours
from Sector 14

11:28.333 --> 11:30.458
So I thought I'd try
a long-range scan.

11:30.542 --> 11:33.250
The temporal rift is twice
as big as it was before.

11:33.333 --> 11:35.542
- Any idea what's responsible?
- Yeah.

11:35.625 --> 11:37.958
It's being caused by an
extremely powerful tachyon field

11:38.042 --> 11:40.625
being transmitted into
the center of the rift.

11:40.708 --> 11:42.875
And captain, it's coming
from Epsilon 3.

11:58.333 --> 12:00.833
[zapping]

12:02.542 --> 12:04.292
[grunts]

12:05.542 --> 12:07.292
You see?

12:07.375 --> 12:10.042
Just as Zathras said

12:10.125 --> 12:11.292
not good.

12:11.375 --> 12:13.375
Definitely not good.

12:13.458 --> 12:16.292
- We must tell Draal.
- No!

12:16.375 --> 12:19.292
Is taking all
of Draal's concentration

12:19.375 --> 12:21.875
to control
great machine.

12:21.958 --> 12:23.958
If we distract

12:24.042 --> 12:25.833
very bad.

12:25.917 --> 12:29.583
Disrupt time field.

12:29.667 --> 12:31.792
Everyone die.

12:31.875 --> 12:35.375
Draal told Zathras
what to do.

12:35.458 --> 12:38.292
So Zathras will do.

12:38.375 --> 12:40.125
Or much, much dyings.

12:48.458 --> 12:50.375
Delenn, if the temporal rift

12:50.458 --> 12:52.583
is being affected
by transmissions

12:52.667 --> 12:54.333
from the planet below us,
isn't that where

12:54.417 --> 12:57.167
we should be going instead of
hooking up with the White Star?

12:57.250 --> 12:59.083
It will take
too much time.

12:59.167 --> 13:02.000
We must leave
for Sector 14 now.

13:02.083 --> 13:03.542
Why? Why right now?

13:03.625 --> 13:06.542
Because this is the time
we are supposed to leave.

13:06.625 --> 13:08.792
That's circular reasoning.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.583
Once we arrive
at the White Star

13:10.667 --> 13:12.917
I will explain
everything.

13:13.042 --> 13:18.042
John, I have rarely
asked you for anything.

13:18.125 --> 13:20.292
Now I'm asking.

13:25.792 --> 13:27.917
Computer,
adjust long-range scanners.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.083
Scan for full range
of frequencies.

13:36.792 --> 13:39.833
(Ivanova)
'They're coming through! Repeat!
They're coming through!'

13:39.917 --> 13:42.208
'This is Earth Alliance
station Babylon 5!'

13:42.292 --> 13:44.250
'They're all over the place!'

13:45.458 --> 13:47.042
Nuts. Let's try
to boost the signal.

13:47.125 --> 13:50.167
Transfer power from
auxiliary systems to scanners.

13:59.500 --> 14:02.542
(Ivanova)
Shuttle 2 to shuttle 1,
we're clear to proceed.

14:02.625 --> 14:04.500
Confirmed,
shuttle 2.

14:05.917 --> 14:08.375
You know, back at the station,
I was pretty surprised

14:08.458 --> 14:11.292
to see you walk
into the war room.

14:11.375 --> 14:12.667
When an ambassador
comes to visit

14:12.750 --> 14:15.292
we usually have
some advance warning.

14:15.375 --> 14:17.083
There wasn't time.

14:17.167 --> 14:19.542
And believe me,
my being here

14:19.625 --> 14:22.583
is as much of a surprise to me
as it is to you.

14:22.667 --> 14:24.625
Is it?

14:26.958 --> 14:29.167
Delenn either knew you were here
or knew you were coming.

14:29.250 --> 14:32.750
Your timing seems like more
than a coincidence.

14:32.833 --> 14:34.958
There are no
coincidences, captain.

14:37.125 --> 14:38.958
That's not much
of an answer.

14:39.042 --> 14:40.792
'Captain, if I were you'

14:40.875 --> 14:42.333
'I'd quit while I was ahead.'

14:42.417 --> 14:45.250
Back on Minbar, there was a
saying among the other Rangers.

14:45.333 --> 14:48.042
Only way to get a straight
answer out of Ranger one

14:48.125 --> 14:50.667
was to look
at every reply in a mirror

14:50.750 --> 14:52.875
while hanging upside down
from the ceiling.

14:52.958 --> 14:54.125
Did it work?

14:54.208 --> 14:56.042
Oddly enough, yes.

14:56.125 --> 14:58.250
Or after a while, you passed out
and had a vision.

14:58.333 --> 15:01.208
Either way, the result
was pretty much the same.

15:13.250 --> 15:15.625
Damn. Still nothing.

15:15.708 --> 15:17.500
Alright, cut life support 15%.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.958
Maybe that will give us enough
power to pull in a signal.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.167
That's got it.

15:25.250 --> 15:27.417
Oh, hell.

15:27.500 --> 15:28.833
They're killing us.

15:28.917 --> 15:30.333
Can anyone hear me?

15:30.417 --> 15:31.875
(Ivanova)
'They're killing us.'

15:31.958 --> 15:34.125
'Does anyone out there
hear me?'

15:34.917 --> 15:36.333
Jeez! Begin recording.

15:36.417 --> 15:39.167
Can anyone help us? This is
Commander Susan Ivanova

15:39.250 --> 15:42.750
Babylon 5, to any ships
in grid Epsilon.

15:42.833 --> 15:45.125
We are under attack.

15:45.208 --> 15:47.458
I repeat,
we are under attack.

15:47.542 --> 15:49.208
The captain's dead.

15:49.292 --> 15:52.167
Defense grid is down.

15:52.250 --> 15:55.000
They're boarding us. They're
coming in all over the place.

15:56.125 --> 15:58.625
We've tried to evacuate
as many as we can

15:58.708 --> 16:01.417
and Garibaldi has rigged
the fusion reactor. But..

16:01.500 --> 16:03.542
[alarm blaring]

16:03.625 --> 16:06.167
Oh, my God.
Hear they come.

16:07.375 --> 16:09.833
Switch to external cameras.

16:11.875 --> 16:14.917
[dramatic music]

16:19.083 --> 16:21.333
They've got
weapons lock.

16:21.417 --> 16:23.042
Here it comes.

16:23.125 --> 16:24.208
Here it comes!

16:25.250 --> 16:26.917
[screaming]

16:43.500 --> 16:45.667
Alright, Delenn.
We're all here.

16:47.667 --> 16:49.083
Now, would you
mind explaining

16:49.167 --> 16:52.375
what it is we're
supposed to be doing?

16:55.375 --> 16:57.833
Do you trust me, John?

16:57.917 --> 16:59.583
What kind of a question
is that?

16:59.667 --> 17:02.875
It is the most important
question I have ever asked.

17:02.958 --> 17:05.042
Do you trust me?

17:05.125 --> 17:06.583
With my life.

17:06.667 --> 17:07.625
Why?

17:07.708 --> 17:09.292
Then sit.

17:09.375 --> 17:11.000
All of you, please.

17:16.042 --> 17:19.083
I became aware of the
transmission from Epsilon 3

17:19.167 --> 17:20.917
a few hours before we left.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.250
At the same time

17:22.333 --> 17:26.792
some other information
came into my possession.

17:26.875 --> 17:29.708
As you know, our last great war
against the Shadows

17:29.792 --> 17:31.333
was a thousand years ago.

17:31.417 --> 17:33.917
With the help of the Vorlons
and a few others

17:34.000 --> 17:37.167
we were able to defeat them

17:37.250 --> 17:38.792
driving them from
their homeworld, Z'ha'dum.

17:38.875 --> 17:42.417
But there is something
you do not know.

17:42.500 --> 17:44.375
'What you are about to see'

17:44.458 --> 17:47.833
'has never been shown to anyone
outside the Grey Council.'

17:53.042 --> 17:55.833
This is one of the few surviving
records from that war.

17:55.917 --> 17:57.125
Toward the end

17:57.208 --> 18:01.125
the tide of battle
had turned against us.

18:01.208 --> 18:04.125
Our greatest starbase,
the center of our efforts

18:04.208 --> 18:07.333
in the war, had been
destroyed by the Shadows.

18:07.417 --> 18:09.333
Without a long-range base
of operations

18:09.417 --> 18:10.875
from which to launch
our forces

18:10.958 --> 18:13.417
we were doomed
to lose the war.

18:13.500 --> 18:17.375
Then, as if in answer
to our prayers

18:17.458 --> 18:19.458
a replacement arrived.

18:24.500 --> 18:26.208
Babylon 4.

18:32.333 --> 18:34.125
My God,
we always knew

18:34.208 --> 18:36.333
that Babylon 4 had been taken
somewhere in time.

18:36.417 --> 18:38.833
But we assumed it
was into the future.

18:38.917 --> 18:41.292
No, it was taken
into the distant past

18:41.375 --> 18:43.792
where it helped us
defeat the Shadows.

18:43.875 --> 18:46.917
Without Babylon 4,
we would have lost the war.

18:47.042 --> 18:49.542
Or it would have ended
in a stalemate.

18:49.625 --> 18:52.500
So you're saying
the Minbari..

18:52.583 --> 18:54.708
...that you stole Babylon 4.

18:54.792 --> 18:57.375
Not quite.

18:57.458 --> 18:58.875
Before coming to you

18:58.958 --> 19:02.083
I received two additional
records from Draal.

19:02.167 --> 19:04.000
Remember, the great machine
on Epsilon 3

19:04.083 --> 19:06.083
has been there
for over 500 years.

19:06.167 --> 19:08.875
During that time, it recorded
much of what happened

19:08.958 --> 19:10.500
in this area of space.

19:11.958 --> 19:14.625
After Babylon 4 vanished
six years ago

19:14.708 --> 19:16.833
it reappeared again
two years ago.

19:16.917 --> 19:19.917
Ambassador Sinclair and
Mr. Garibaldi traveled there

19:20.000 --> 19:22.792
at great personal risk
to help evacuate her crew

19:22.875 --> 19:24.250
before it vanished again.

19:24.333 --> 19:27.500
It was a close call.
We almost didn't get out.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.917
We never did find out
who was behind it.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.250
'And that is about to change.'

19:32.333 --> 19:33.875
This was recorded shortly

19:33.958 --> 19:37.167
before the station first
disappeared six years ago.

19:38.542 --> 19:40.708
As Babylon 4
neared completion

19:40.792 --> 19:44.417
the allies of the Shadows
recognized it for what it was

19:44.500 --> 19:48.125
and sent these ships
to destroy it.

19:48.208 --> 19:49.583
By striking without warning

19:49.667 --> 19:52.583
they would have succeeded
in their attack.

19:52.667 --> 19:55.958
But something stopped them.

20:01.083 --> 20:02.292
The White Star?

20:02.375 --> 20:04.667
Delenn, are you saying
we stole Babylon 4?

20:04.750 --> 20:05.958
But that was years ago.

20:06.042 --> 20:08.500
Yes, and that is exactly
where we must go.

20:08.583 --> 20:11.458
At this moment, the great
machine is using all its power

20:11.542 --> 20:14.125
to enlarge the temporal rift
in Sector 14.

20:14.208 --> 20:17.125
We will use it to go back
six years into the past.

20:17.208 --> 20:21.000
Once there, we must prevent
the destruction of Babylon 4

20:21.083 --> 20:23.917
and take the station
with us through time.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.167
Because if we fail
to save Babylon 4

20:28.250 --> 20:30.917
Babylon 5 will
also be destroyed.

20:39.125 --> 20:41.708
Delenn, the question
of who stole Babylon 4

20:41.792 --> 20:44.167
is the biggest mystery
of the last decade.

20:44.250 --> 20:46.750
Now you're telling me
it was me?

20:46.833 --> 20:49.958
Is me?
Is going to be me?

20:50.042 --> 20:51.625
You can't be serious.

20:51.708 --> 20:53.500
John, with Babylon 4

20:53.583 --> 20:56.333
we will be able to save
my people and yours.

20:56.417 --> 20:59.125
It is history.
It has already been done.

20:59.208 --> 21:00.500
All we have to do now

21:00.583 --> 21:02.167
is make sure
that we do it then.

21:02.250 --> 21:03.917
How long have you
known about this?

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
Not long. Until
I came to Babylon 5

21:07.083 --> 21:09.917
none of us knew where
the station had come from.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.333
We knew only that
it helped us win the war.

21:13.417 --> 21:15.333
Once I learned
the truth

21:15.417 --> 21:17.042
I was afraid
to say anything

21:17.125 --> 21:20.750
in case I might accidentally
change the future.

21:20.833 --> 21:23.333
Delenn, I still don't understand
how taking Babylon 4

21:23.417 --> 21:25.833
will prevent the destruction
of Babylon 5.

21:25.917 --> 21:27.417
When we defeated
the Shadows

21:27.500 --> 21:30.000
we destroyed most
of their fleet of ships.

21:30.083 --> 21:31.750
That's why they're
moving slowly.

21:31.833 --> 21:34.208
It's taking them
time to rebuild their ships.

21:34.292 --> 21:36.583
Without Babylon 4,
the Shadows would not

21:36.667 --> 21:38.500
have been defeated and
driven from Z'ha'dum.

21:38.583 --> 21:41.958
Instead they would have dug in
and waited with three times

21:42.042 --> 21:43.917
the amount of ships they would
have had otherwise.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.792
She's telling
the truth, captain.

21:45.875 --> 21:48.208
If we don't go along,
we'll change history

21:48.292 --> 21:50.250
and the Shadows will
come out of the last war

21:50.333 --> 21:52.000
stronger than they should be.

21:52.083 --> 21:54.000
We won't stand a chance against
odds like that.

21:54.083 --> 21:56.375
Would you like to tell me
what you base that on?

21:56.458 --> 21:58.333
Let's just say that
my information comes

21:58.417 --> 22:00.375
from a very reliable source.

22:02.667 --> 22:04.167
So, you believe this?

22:04.250 --> 22:05.458
I believe it.

22:05.542 --> 22:07.708
If Entil-zha believes it,
I believe it.

22:07.792 --> 22:09.667
I'll be in the car.

22:09.750 --> 22:13.167
John, we're less than
two hours from Sector 14.

22:13.250 --> 22:15.667
If we do not proceed,
a possible future

22:15.750 --> 22:17.125
will become
the true future.

22:17.208 --> 22:18.833
In that future

22:18.917 --> 22:21.417
the Shadows have
most of their fleet intact.

22:21.500 --> 22:23.792
And in their next
major attack

22:23.875 --> 22:25.792
Babylon 5
is destroyed.

22:25.875 --> 22:27.583
So that's what I picked up
in C&amp;C?

22:27.667 --> 22:30.250
My voice in this alternate
future calling out for help?

22:30.333 --> 22:33.042
Sheridan to C&amp;C. Patch me
through to Garibaldi.

22:35.958 --> 22:37.167
Go.

22:37.250 --> 22:38.917
'Chief, are you out
in Sector 14?'

22:39.000 --> 22:40.583
I got here
about an hour ago.

22:40.667 --> 22:42.750
Been running those scanners
recording everything I can.

22:42.833 --> 22:44.667
(Sheridan)
'What have you found?'

22:44.750 --> 22:47.458
It's the same sequence
over again.

22:47.542 --> 22:49.583
I've just seen Babylon 5
destroyed four times

22:49.667 --> 22:51.292
each time, the same.

22:51.375 --> 22:54.292
The time stamped on the message
is dated eight days from now.

22:54.375 --> 22:56.708
'I've checked the subchannel ID
to verify the transmission.'

22:56.792 --> 22:58.917
'And it's legit, alright.'

22:59.000 --> 23:01.708
Eight days from now,
we go straight to hell.

23:01.792 --> 23:03.875
Unless you've found some way
to stop it.

23:03.958 --> 23:05.000
Stand by.

23:05.083 --> 23:07.250
I've come a long way to
be here for this.

23:07.333 --> 23:09.500
I'd hate to turn around
and go back again.

23:09.583 --> 23:11.833
Besides, I think
we'd work well together

23:11.917 --> 23:14.625
like Butch and Sundance

23:14.708 --> 23:17.167
Lois and Clark..

23:17.250 --> 23:18.708
...Lucy and Ethel.

23:24.083 --> 23:25.875
Well, when
I joined Earthforce

23:25.958 --> 23:28.958
the sign said, "Greatest
adventure of all."

23:29.833 --> 23:31.958
If they only knew.

23:34.375 --> 23:36.458
Alright, let's do it.

23:36.542 --> 23:38.000
Lucy and Ethel?

23:39.625 --> 23:42.292
Sheridan to Garibaldi,
we're on it.

23:42.375 --> 23:44.042
Head on back to the barn.

23:44.125 --> 23:45.833
Roger that.

23:49.708 --> 23:51.750
[dramatic music]

23:55.208 --> 23:58.625
Delenn, it appears
we're being followed.

23:58.708 --> 24:00.208
Put it on screen.

24:02.458 --> 24:05.125
'It appeared on the screen
shortly after we left.'

24:05.208 --> 24:07.333
'I believe it came
from Epsilon 3.'

24:07.417 --> 24:10.583
Good. It carries the cargo
we need for our journey.

24:10.667 --> 24:12.792
My people may be more
technically advanced than yours

24:12.875 --> 24:14.833
but even we do not
have the technology

24:14.917 --> 24:17.625
for controlling a time field
as unstable as this one.

24:17.708 --> 24:20.750
Only the great machine
on Epsilon 3 has such equipment.

24:20.833 --> 24:24.167
Slow 1/3.
Allow the ship to dock.

24:26.042 --> 24:28.542
[dramatic music]

24:28.625 --> 24:29.750
According to Draal

24:29.833 --> 24:30.917
the time-shifting mechanism

24:31.000 --> 24:33.375
needs a clearly defined
target.

24:33.458 --> 24:35.000
We must place
a homing device

24:35.083 --> 24:36.875
in the central power core
of Babylon 4.

24:36.958 --> 24:39.750
Once that's done, we can begin
moving it through time.

24:39.833 --> 24:41.917
- Is that Draal on the ship?
- No.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.958
He's busy keeping the great
machine under control.

24:44.042 --> 24:45.375
It's quite a strain.

24:45.458 --> 24:47.417
He said he was sending along
one of his aides.

24:47.500 --> 24:49.042
[Zathras screaming]

24:49.125 --> 24:50.833
Sorry. Sorry.

24:50.917 --> 24:54.833
Sorry.
Much apologizings.

24:54.917 --> 24:58.417
Zathras has great
responsibilities.

24:58.500 --> 25:00.417
'Was thinking
great thoughts.'

25:00.500 --> 25:01.792
'Did not see you.'

25:01.875 --> 25:03.792
'Was looking for the one.'

25:03.875 --> 25:05.083
'Was thinking
great thoughts.'

25:05.167 --> 25:06.875
'Very sorry. Very sorry.'

25:06.958 --> 25:08.875
Hah!

25:08.958 --> 25:11.750
[exclaims]

25:11.833 --> 25:13.667
(male #1)
Says his name is Zathras.

25:13.750 --> 25:15.875
We don't know how he got
aboard, where he came from

25:15.958 --> 25:17.333
or what race he is.

25:17.417 --> 25:19.542
I've never seen an alien
like him before.

25:21.333 --> 25:23.542
[exclaims]

25:29.500 --> 25:31.583
Not the one.

25:31.667 --> 25:32.750
Not the one what?

25:32.833 --> 25:34.417
You're not the one.

25:35.250 --> 25:36.708
'There you are.'

25:37.833 --> 25:41.750
Being very honored
to meet you.

25:41.833 --> 25:43.708
I am being called..

25:43.792 --> 25:44.667
Zathras.

25:44.750 --> 25:48.000
We've met before
on Babylon 4.

25:49.708 --> 25:51.500
No.

25:51.583 --> 25:52.750
Zathras does not--

25:52.833 --> 25:56.292
It was my past,
your future.

25:57.250 --> 26:00.667
Zathras, this is
very important.

26:00.750 --> 26:02.458
When you meet me again,
it will be me

26:02.542 --> 26:04.292
but it won't be me now.

26:04.375 --> 26:07.000
So you're not to say anything to
me that might change the past.

26:07.083 --> 26:08.333
Do you understand?

26:08.417 --> 26:12.250
Yeah. Zathras understand.

26:12.333 --> 26:14.500
No, Zathras not understand

26:14.583 --> 26:16.167
but Zathras do.

26:16.250 --> 26:20.042
Zathras good at doings,
not understandings.

26:20.958 --> 26:25.000
Zathras honored
to meet you..

26:25.917 --> 26:29.250
...for many reasons.

26:29.333 --> 26:35.333
Zathras also honored
to meet you

26:35.417 --> 26:37.458
'...for other reasons.'

26:39.667 --> 26:41.208
Uh, such as?

26:41.292 --> 26:43.375
Ah. Oh, no.

26:43.458 --> 26:48.458
Draal gave Zathras
list of things not to say.

26:48.542 --> 26:50.458
This was one.

26:50.542 --> 26:52.458
No, not good.

26:52.542 --> 26:55.333
Not supposed to
mention one.

26:55.417 --> 26:57.333
'Or the one. Oh.'

26:59.250 --> 27:00.792
You never heard that.

27:00.875 --> 27:03.375
What else is on
this list of things

27:03.458 --> 27:05.167
you're not supposed
to mention?

27:06.542 --> 27:10.458
Zathras does not remember.

27:10.542 --> 27:12.833
But if Zathras
remember later

27:12.917 --> 27:14.917
Zathras tells you.

27:15.000 --> 27:15.958
That'll be fine.

27:16.042 --> 27:17.208
Isn't that fine,
captain?

27:17.292 --> 27:19.833
Oh, fine, ambassador.

27:19.917 --> 27:21.458
The ship has been
locked down

27:21.542 --> 27:24.125
and the equipment
is being unloaded.

27:24.208 --> 27:26.625
We may proceed.

27:26.708 --> 27:28.250
Good. Good.

27:28.333 --> 27:29.875
Zathras is ready.

27:29.958 --> 27:32.125
We go.

27:32.208 --> 27:34.792
Hurryings
is very important.

27:37.208 --> 27:39.042
One last thing,
captain.

27:39.125 --> 27:41.167
On our way out,
I'm going to need a favor.

27:45.458 --> 27:48.500
[intense music]

27:50.333 --> 27:51.750
Sheridan to Garibaldi.

27:51.833 --> 27:54.667
Captain. What are you
doing out here?

27:55.750 --> 27:59.583
'We're proceeding
to Sector 14.'

27:59.667 --> 28:01.083
Report back
to the station.

28:01.167 --> 28:02.708
Keep an eye on things
while we're gone.

28:02.792 --> 28:05.208
'What are you talkin' about?
I should go with you.'

28:05.292 --> 28:07.083
Negative.
Report to base.

28:07.167 --> 28:09.667
We can't take the whole
command staff on this one.

28:09.750 --> 28:11.083
You've done your job.

28:11.167 --> 28:12.292
Captain--

28:12.375 --> 28:14.000
That's an order, Mr. Garibaldi.

28:14.083 --> 28:16.000
Yes, sir.

28:16.083 --> 28:17.792
'Good.'

28:17.875 --> 28:20.542
I'll see you at the barn
when we get back.

28:22.458 --> 28:24.917
Alright, I did as you asked.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.625
I sent him home and didn't
tell him you were here.

28:27.708 --> 28:31.667
Why the secrecy?
Didn't you want to talk to him?

28:31.750 --> 28:33.542
More than you'll ever know.

28:42.250 --> 28:44.083
Told you.

28:44.167 --> 28:45.958
[sighs]

28:51.917 --> 28:54.958
[dramatic music]

29:00.083 --> 29:02.292
Goodbye, old friend.

29:06.375 --> 29:07.792
[guns zapping]

29:07.875 --> 29:09.250
[screaming]

29:13.250 --> 29:14.667
[wick hissing]

29:14.750 --> 29:16.042
They've burned through levels
seven and eight.

29:16.125 --> 29:17.792
Can't stop 'em!
They're everywhere!

29:17.875 --> 29:19.167
Garibaldi--

29:19.250 --> 29:21.292
I've rigged the fusion reactors.
But there's not much time.

29:21.375 --> 29:23.417
Get going. I'll hold them
as long as I can.

29:25.042 --> 29:27.542
Look, come on,
this isn't a conversation.

29:27.625 --> 29:30.542
Jeff, it's okay.
I finally understand.

29:30.625 --> 29:32.500
It's the moment
I was born for.

29:32.583 --> 29:34.417
Now, go. Go!

29:35.167 --> 29:36.208
Go!

29:36.292 --> 29:37.583
Wait, wait!

29:37.667 --> 29:39.917
They're coming through!

29:42.417 --> 29:45.500
[music continues]

29:53.167 --> 29:55.250
[explosion]

29:57.167 --> 29:58.667
No.

29:58.750 --> 30:00.917
It won't happen.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.917
I won't let it happen.

30:10.292 --> 30:12.042
Please to taking.

30:13.667 --> 30:16.833
When we travel in time

30:16.917 --> 30:19.958
we pass through great waves

30:20.042 --> 30:23.708
of tachyon impulses.

30:23.792 --> 30:27.333
You can become
unstuck in time..

30:27.417 --> 30:29.708
...unless there is anchor.

30:29.792 --> 30:32.875
These will keep you
from drifting.

30:32.958 --> 30:35.708
Also, protect you.

30:35.792 --> 30:39.958
Time distortion
can do terrible harm.

30:40.042 --> 30:42.083
I know. The last time
Babylon 4 appeared

30:42.167 --> 30:46.542
a pilot we sent out
to investigate died of old age.

30:46.625 --> 30:48.667
I guess you got lucky.

30:48.750 --> 30:51.000
Well, looks like this is it.

30:51.083 --> 30:53.458
Everybody, get ready.

30:53.542 --> 30:54.625
Mr. Lennier..

30:57.667 --> 31:00.167
...move us into the rift.

31:00.250 --> 31:02.292
[whooshing]

31:09.750 --> 31:11.792
[intense music]

31:27.792 --> 31:29.833
[rumbling]

32:00.667 --> 32:02.667
- Hey Zack, how's it going?
- Fine, fine.

32:02.750 --> 32:04.667
Hey, hey. You missed
all the excitement.

32:04.750 --> 32:06.667
Ambassador Sinclair
was here.

32:06.750 --> 32:08.333
What? You're kidding, right?

32:08.417 --> 32:10.625
- No.
- Where is he?

32:10.708 --> 32:11.958
Gone, he took off with
the captain

32:12.042 --> 32:14.042
and everybody else on
the White Star.

32:14.125 --> 32:16.750
No, he wouldn't
come all this way

32:16.833 --> 32:18.500
then just leave
without telling me.

32:18.583 --> 32:20.375
Did he leave any kind
of message?

32:20.458 --> 32:21.958
'I'm sorry, no.'

32:22.042 --> 32:26.000
At least he didn't say
anything to me about it.

32:26.083 --> 32:27.833
Thanks.

32:31.167 --> 32:33.208
[intense music]

32:44.625 --> 32:47.083
Alright, scanners at maximum.

32:47.167 --> 32:49.208
If those Shadow fighters
really are here somewhere

32:49.292 --> 32:51.083
we have to find them.

32:51.167 --> 32:53.833
I've got something.

32:53.917 --> 32:55.792
Show me.

32:59.542 --> 33:00.958
Magnify.

33:01.958 --> 33:04.125
What the hell is that?

33:04.208 --> 33:06.250
[whooshing]

33:08.708 --> 33:11.333
Picking up high levels of
radiation, magnetic grapples.

33:11.417 --> 33:12.875
Looks like a fusion bomb.

33:12.958 --> 33:14.417
They probably intend to
grapple it onto the reactor

33:14.500 --> 33:16.000
then run like hell
before it blows.

33:16.083 --> 33:17.542
And make it look
like an accident.

33:17.625 --> 33:19.375
How far are they
from Babylon 4?

33:19.458 --> 33:21.542
Three thousand
kilometers.

33:21.625 --> 33:24.833
Plot a course to intercept.
Give me everything you've got.

33:30.458 --> 33:31.625
[whooshing]

33:31.708 --> 33:33.750
Computer, any messages for me?

33:33.833 --> 33:37.708
(female automated announcer)
'Confirmed. Two status reports
from station house.'

33:37.792 --> 33:39.542
'One message
from maintenance.'

33:39.625 --> 33:41.458
'One from
Jeffrey Sinclair.'

33:41.542 --> 33:43.583
Stop. Display message
from Sinclair.

33:43.667 --> 33:45.083
'Unable to comply.'

33:45.167 --> 33:47.750
'Password required
for access.'

33:47.833 --> 33:49.500
Password? What password?

33:49.583 --> 33:51.542
'Unable to comply.'

33:53.542 --> 33:56.583
[dramatic music]

33:56.667 --> 33:57.917
They've seen us.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.583
Three fighters breaking off,
heading our way.

34:00.667 --> 34:03.917
Stand by,
forward batteries. Fire!

34:04.042 --> 34:07.083
[zapping]

34:10.333 --> 34:11.375
[gunfire]

34:14.333 --> 34:15.583
Status?

34:15.667 --> 34:17.917
Damage is minimal.

34:18.000 --> 34:21.458
(Lennier)
'The White Star is based on
Vorlon organic technology.'

34:21.542 --> 34:24.792
'It learns from experience.
Changes, evolves.'

34:24.875 --> 34:27.667
'The skin of the ship now uses
the Vorlon defense system.'

34:27.750 --> 34:29.625
Most of the energy
is reflected away

34:29.708 --> 34:31.542
leaving only
the physical impact.

34:31.625 --> 34:34.542
Well, as my great-grandfather
used to say, cool.

34:34.625 --> 34:36.458
Bring us in
on the primary target.

34:36.542 --> 34:38.500
Nisi du zafann drok.

34:41.875 --> 34:44.083
[zapping]

34:44.167 --> 34:45.792
Jeff. Jeffrey.

34:45.875 --> 34:47.500
'Negative on password.'

34:47.583 --> 34:49.000
'Unable to deliver.'

34:51.042 --> 34:54.667
Peek-a-boo. Susan. Michael.
Socks. Fasten. Zip.

34:54.750 --> 34:56.500
'Negative on password.'

34:56.583 --> 34:58.250
'Unable to comply.'

34:58.333 --> 35:00.500
Damn it.

35:00.583 --> 35:03.250
What would he think of?

35:05.750 --> 35:09.375
Password, phrase, three words.
Hello, old friend.

35:09.458 --> 35:12.833
'Password confirmed.
Stand by.'

35:12.917 --> 35:15.542
Hello Michael,
by the time you get this

35:15.625 --> 35:18.167
I should be long gone.

35:18.250 --> 35:20.583
I'm sorry I couldn't
tell you I was here.

35:20.667 --> 35:23.208
Sorry I couldn't
see you.

35:23.292 --> 35:25.500
But if I told you what was up,
you'd want to come along

35:25.583 --> 35:27.750
even knowing the price, and..

35:27.833 --> 35:30.042
I can't allow that.

35:30.125 --> 35:31.292
But I had to leave something.

35:31.375 --> 35:35.333
I couldn't leave without
saying ...goodbye.

35:35.417 --> 35:40.125
You see, Michael, I won't be
coming back from Babylon 4.

35:40.208 --> 35:41.417
And if you went
with me

35:41.500 --> 35:43.125
you wouldn't
make it back, either.

35:48.875 --> 35:50.917
[dramatic music]

35:51.958 --> 35:53.417
Distance to target?

35:53.500 --> 35:56.208
Still outside optimum firing
range for automatic systems.

35:56.292 --> 35:58.375
Captain, if that thing gets
closer to Babylon 4

35:58.458 --> 36:00.458
we risk damaging
the station when it blows.

36:00.542 --> 36:01.917
Can you hit it
from here on manual?

36:02.000 --> 36:04.208
- I can try.
- Do so.

36:07.083 --> 36:09.167
[whooshing]

36:13.625 --> 36:16.583
'Babylon 4 now within
estimated blast range.'

36:16.667 --> 36:17.958
But then so are we.

36:18.042 --> 36:20.375
In that case,
hang onto your socks.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.042
[zapping]

36:32.292 --> 36:33.333
Lennier, get us out of here!

36:33.417 --> 36:35.750
It's too late!

36:36.375 --> 36:38.417
[intense music]

36:41.917 --> 36:43.583
Aah!

36:43.667 --> 36:45.417
(Ivanova)
His stabilizer!
It's hit!

36:45.500 --> 36:46.458
John!

36:46.542 --> 36:48.250
No!

36:48.333 --> 36:50.208
[whispers]
John.

36:57.792 --> 37:00.458
(Ivanova)
W-w-what happened
to him?

37:00.542 --> 37:03.667
Time stabilizer damaged.

37:03.750 --> 37:06.583
He is unstuck in time.

37:06.667 --> 37:11.625
Zathras warn, but no one
listen to Zathras, no.

37:11.708 --> 37:13.375
What do you mean,
unstuck in time?

37:13.458 --> 37:15.792
Where is he, in the past,
in the future?

37:15.875 --> 37:19.833
Cannot say.
Saying, I would know.

37:19.917 --> 37:22.333
Do not know,
so cannot say.

37:25.292 --> 37:28.125
Very damaged.

37:28.208 --> 37:30.958
Zathras can never
have anything nice.

37:31.042 --> 37:32.792
We must find him.

37:32.875 --> 37:35.333
- Later. Babylon 4--
- Can wait.

37:35.417 --> 37:38.500
No, it can't. Sheridan knew
the risks the same as we did.

37:38.583 --> 37:41.125
All of us are expendable.
What counts is the mission.

37:41.208 --> 37:42.583
He'd want us to continue.

37:42.667 --> 37:44.208
We may be able to
pull him back, but first

37:44.292 --> 37:46.083
we have to get to Babylon 4.

37:46.167 --> 37:47.583
The explosion sent out
enough EMP

37:47.667 --> 37:49.125
to blow out their scanners
for a while.

37:49.208 --> 37:50.667
We have one chance
to get on board.

37:50.750 --> 37:53.083
If we wait too long,
we'll lose it.

37:53.167 --> 37:55.667
Susan, if we don't
follow through

37:55.750 --> 37:58.333
'then Sheridan went through
this for nothing.'

37:58.417 --> 37:59.625
Putting the future
back on track

37:59.708 --> 38:01.958
may be our only chance
to save him.

38:05.208 --> 38:07.417
What's our status?

38:10.583 --> 38:13.792
Power's up to 70% of capacity.
We can maneuver.

38:13.875 --> 38:15.875
Good. We came here to do a job.

38:15.958 --> 38:18.250
And by God, one way or another
we're going to finish it.

38:18.333 --> 38:19.833
Neshalla, wa. Zeni!

38:29.500 --> 38:31.708
[grunts]

38:33.125 --> 38:34.375
[screams]

38:34.458 --> 38:36.333
[coughing]

38:36.417 --> 38:38.458
'I think he's awake again,
excellency.'

38:38.542 --> 38:40.375
Would you like to see?

38:50.625 --> 38:53.083
Londo?

38:53.750 --> 38:54.750
What..

38:54.833 --> 38:57.083
what am I doing here?

38:57.167 --> 39:00.333
Welcome back from
the abyss, Sheridan.

39:00.417 --> 39:02.917
Your timing, as always

39:03.000 --> 39:06.167
is quite exceptional.

39:06.250 --> 39:08.167
Just in time to die.

39:16.875 --> 39:18.750
Babylon 4 scanners
are still down.

39:18.833 --> 39:20.583
Recommend we go in,
find a stable area

39:20.667 --> 39:22.708
where we can grapple on
and burn our way through.

39:22.792 --> 39:25.167
I agree.
Bring us in.

39:32.875 --> 39:35.250
This was not part
of the plan.

39:35.333 --> 39:37.875
I did not expect this.

39:38.000 --> 39:42.417
We cannot even know where
in time Sheridan has gone.

39:42.500 --> 39:44.750
He'll be alright.

39:44.833 --> 39:46.583
[speaking Minbari]

40:02.250 --> 40:04.333
All my life

40:04.417 --> 40:07.625
I've had doubts
about who I am..

40:07.708 --> 40:09.250
...where I belong.

40:09.333 --> 40:10.625
Now..

40:10.708 --> 40:13.125
I'm like the arrow
that springs from the bow.

40:13.208 --> 40:16.000
No hesitation,
no doubts.

40:16.083 --> 40:17.750
The path is clear.

40:31.917 --> 40:34.500
[intense music]

40:34.583 --> 40:36.667
Londo.

40:36.750 --> 40:40.875
What am I doing here?
What are you--

40:40.958 --> 40:42.375
What I am doing is what someone

40:42.458 --> 40:44.917
should have done
a long time ago.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.458
Putting you
out of my misery.

40:48.542 --> 40:52.417
Fitting punishment
for your crimes.

40:52.500 --> 40:55.042
What crimes?
I--

40:55.125 --> 40:56.833
The crime of neglect!

40:56.917 --> 40:59.625
'The crime
of convenience.'

40:59.708 --> 41:00.875
During your little war

41:01.000 --> 41:04.542
you drove away
the Shadows, oh, yes.

41:04.625 --> 41:08.042
But you did not think
to clean up your mess!

41:08.125 --> 41:09.583
The few of their minions

41:09.667 --> 41:14.458
their dark servants came
to Centauri Prime. Well..

41:14.542 --> 41:17.333
Where is the harm
in that, yes?

41:17.417 --> 41:18.417
I..

41:18.500 --> 41:20.000
'Hmm?'

41:20.083 --> 41:22.125
'You want to see
the harm?'

41:22.208 --> 41:24.167
Do you?

41:29.083 --> 41:30.833
[grunts]

41:35.667 --> 41:37.708
[intense music]

41:42.292 --> 41:45.667
(Londo)
'There's the legacy
of your war.'

42:05.750 --> 42:07.083
Assessment?

42:07.167 --> 42:09.125
Configuration's a little
different than Babylon 5.

42:09.208 --> 42:11.208
My guess is we can get to
the reactor system that way.

42:11.292 --> 42:12.917
Getting there isn't
the hard part.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.958
Getting all that equipment into
position without being seen.

42:15.042 --> 42:16.542
- That's gonna be tough.
- I agree.

42:16.625 --> 42:18.500
We need to secure
one of the primary corridors.

42:18.583 --> 42:20.250
- Can you handle it?
- I have an idea.

42:20.333 --> 42:21.708
But I gonna need some help.

42:21.792 --> 42:24.500
- You've got it.
- Come on.

42:24.583 --> 42:26.125
I need Lennier to stay
with the ship.

42:26.208 --> 42:28.125
Can you get the equipment up
here by yourself?

42:28.208 --> 42:29.292
Why, yes, yes.

42:29.375 --> 42:33.125
Zathras is used
to being beast of burden

42:33.208 --> 42:35.167
to other people's needs.

42:35.250 --> 42:36.667
Very sad life.

42:36.750 --> 42:39.333
Probably have
very sad death.

42:39.417 --> 42:41.667
But at least
there is symmetry.

42:41.750 --> 42:44.250
Go, go.
Zathras take care.

42:47.292 --> 42:48.125
Ready?

42:48.208 --> 42:49.458
Why do your people always ask

42:49.542 --> 42:50.750
if someone is ready right before

42:50.833 --> 42:52.792
you're going to do something
massively unwise?

42:52.875 --> 42:55.333
Tradition.

43:04.917 --> 43:08.000
