WEBVTT

00:19.319 --> 00:21.386
<i>The political situation</i>

00:21.388 --> 00:23.789
<i>in the world has now reached a stage</i>

00:23.791 --> 00:26.559
<i>where the very foundations
of civilization</i>

00:26.561 --> 00:28.694
<i>are seriously threatened.</i>

00:28.696 --> 00:31.496
<i>War is a contagion.</i>

00:31.498 --> 00:33.298
<i>The peace of the world,</i>

00:33.300 --> 00:36.234
<i>the welfare and security
of every nation,</i>

00:36.236 --> 00:37.503
<i>including our own,</i>

00:37.505 --> 00:40.138
<i>is being threatened
by that very thing.</i>

00:40.140 --> 00:45.243
<i>Let no one imagine that
America will escape.</i>

00:45.245 --> 00:48.280
<i>Yes, we are determined
to keep out of war.</i>

00:48.282 --> 00:50.850
<i>Yet, we cannot insure ourselves</i>

00:50.852 --> 00:53.619
<i>against the disastrous
effects of war,</i>

00:53.621 --> 00:57.057
<i>and the dangers of involvement.</i>

02:07.394 --> 02:11.229
This is bloody ridiculous.

02:11.231 --> 02:13.799
Wasn't your empire built
on ridiculous traditions?

02:13.801 --> 02:15.534
Don't defend them, Layton.

02:15.536 --> 02:17.503
You might speak their language,

02:17.505 --> 02:19.404
but they still think you're a barbarian.

02:19.406 --> 02:20.873
Be honest.

02:20.875 --> 02:22.877
You won't miss this place when you're gone?

02:23.443 --> 02:25.645
Oh, please.

02:25.647 --> 02:27.647
The next time I see the little buggers,

02:27.649 --> 02:30.650
I hope it's through the
sights of a 14-inch gun.

02:37.692 --> 02:39.357
<i>Gentlemen.</i>

02:39.359 --> 02:41.259
On behalf of the British Empire,

02:41.261 --> 02:43.963
I wish to thank Admiral Yamamoto

02:43.965 --> 02:45.230
for this invitation.

02:45.232 --> 02:50.404
May our nations work together
to maintain peace on the seas.

03:04.237 --> 03:05.787
You don't like whiskey?

03:08.170 --> 03:10.861
I could ask you the same question, Admiral.

03:11.373 --> 03:17.913
I have it on good authority that
your glass is filled with tea.

03:21.438 --> 03:23.410
An old Chinese trick.

03:27.166 --> 03:30.218
What else have you learned
during your time in Japan?

03:31.490 --> 03:35.363
I'm just the assistant naval attachÃ©.

03:38.653 --> 03:40.452
Which is why I know

03:40.454 --> 03:42.922
that you must have an opinion.

03:42.924 --> 03:46.226
I was once our naval attache in Washington.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.426
After you went to Harvard.

03:48.428 --> 03:51.396
Like you, I thought there was value

03:51.398 --> 03:54.567
in studying a potential adversary.

03:54.569 --> 03:56.468
There's a rumor that you
told the prime minister

03:56.470 --> 03:58.904
that Japan can't win a
war with the United States.

03:58.906 --> 04:02.541
I said we couldn't win a long war.

04:02.543 --> 04:05.312
There's another rumor that
your life is in danger.

04:06.881 --> 04:08.881
That the nationalists
think you're too moderate

04:08.883 --> 04:10.450
and have targeted you for assassination.

04:21.963 --> 04:24.297
Japan is at a crossroads.

04:25.199 --> 04:28.433
We are emboldened by our invasion of China

04:28.435 --> 04:31.871
and eager to become a world power.

04:31.873 --> 04:34.542
Yet we get 80% of our
oil from your country.

04:36.844 --> 04:40.846
If that supply is threatened,

04:40.848 --> 04:43.651
it will force us into drastic measures.

04:46.020 --> 04:47.787
You want me to pass this information

04:47.789 --> 04:49.454
along to Washington?

04:49.456 --> 04:52.525
Don't push us into a corner.

04:52.527 --> 04:55.761
You must give those of
us who are more reasonable

04:55.763 --> 04:58.566
a chance to carry the day.

04:59.734 --> 05:01.836
Nobody wants a war.

05:09.409 --> 05:10.910
<i>Sayonara.</i>

05:12.880 --> 05:14.414
<i>Sayonara.</i>

06:23.050 --> 06:24.986
Come on. Step it up, ladies!

06:26.053 --> 06:27.686
Clear the flight deck.

06:27.688 --> 06:28.990
Let's go.

06:38.032 --> 06:39.600
Prepare to brace!

06:44.872 --> 06:46.939
Why aren't you using the flaps, sir?

06:46.941 --> 06:48.607
Because someday we might have to land

06:48.609 --> 06:50.242
with our flaps shot away.

06:50.244 --> 06:52.613
So we might as well practice now.

06:56.483 --> 06:58.817
This isn't how Ensign Hunt used to fly.

06:58.819 --> 07:01.086
Which is why Ensign Hunt
is now counting seagulls

07:01.088 --> 07:02.487
in San Diego

07:02.489 --> 07:03.490
and you're here with me.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.827
Looks like we got hit
in our fuel tank, too.

07:07.728 --> 07:09.028
Please don't, sir.

07:09.030 --> 07:11.597
This might save your life one day, Murray.

07:11.599 --> 07:12.633
Engine's about to die.

07:17.271 --> 07:19.772
<i>Stand by to recover aircraft.</i>

07:19.774 --> 07:21.073
What the hell is Best doing?

07:21.075 --> 07:22.508
He's out of the groove.

07:22.510 --> 07:24.243
It looks like his engine cut out.

07:24.245 --> 07:26.679
Is it a stunt, or is he in trouble?

07:26.681 --> 07:28.080
I don't know.

07:28.082 --> 07:30.582
But he's going to hit the
first wire like always.

07:30.584 --> 07:31.686
Not with that angle.

07:35.156 --> 07:36.755
Why are we sideways?

07:36.757 --> 07:37.890
To shave speed

07:37.892 --> 07:40.159
so we don't put a hole in the deck.

07:40.161 --> 07:42.029
Better not crash that damn plane.

07:43.731 --> 07:45.197
Hey, hang in there, kid.

07:45.199 --> 07:46.200
We're almost home.

07:54.675 --> 07:55.676
Brace!

08:21.068 --> 08:23.702
Are you trying to get court marshalled?

08:23.704 --> 08:25.039
I had electrical issue.

08:26.340 --> 08:28.307
Could have happened to anyone.

08:28.309 --> 08:29.641
Hey!

08:29.643 --> 08:31.212
Good job.

08:32.847 --> 08:34.880
Well, it's not me you have to convince.

08:34.881 --> 08:36.982
McClusky's about ready to have your ass.

08:36.984 --> 08:38.984
Then I'll take it upstairs to the old man.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.284
He knows what's coming.

08:40.287 --> 08:41.153
That's why we've been flying

08:41.155 --> 08:43.155
double scouting missions this whole trip.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.834
Going somewhere?

08:55.836 --> 08:57.169
Yeah, they're sending the whole squadron

08:57.171 --> 08:58.337
into Pearl this morning.

08:58.339 --> 09:02.041
And I'll be drinking a beer
on the beach with Roy by noon.

09:02.043 --> 09:03.342
And I'm not coming?

09:03.344 --> 09:05.978
No. McClusky's holding back Scouting Six.

09:05.980 --> 09:07.548
It's probably 'cause
you're such an asshole.

09:08.949 --> 09:11.784
Yeah, you're lovin' this, right?

09:11.786 --> 09:13.886
Morning, sir. Aircraft is spotted.

09:13.888 --> 09:15.888
Hey, take it easy on Miller.

09:15.890 --> 09:17.790
He's having a tough morning.

09:17.792 --> 09:19.825
It's my last day of sea duty, sir.

09:19.827 --> 09:22.161
And I'm the only one from my
radio class who hasn't crashed.

09:22.163 --> 09:23.929
Don't worry, Miller.

09:23.931 --> 09:25.898
I'm sure even Mr. Dickinson can fly you

09:25.900 --> 09:27.666
from here to Pearl without getting you wet.

09:27.668 --> 09:30.335
Hey. Me and Roy,

09:30.337 --> 09:32.740
we'll pour a little beer
out on the beach for ya.

09:53.961 --> 09:56.028
Well, you boys are taking your sweet time.

09:56.030 --> 09:58.397
Chaplain's gonna be here any minute.

09:58.399 --> 10:00.432
It's another hot one, sir.

10:00.434 --> 10:03.202
- Are you complaining, Sully?
- No, sir.

10:03.204 --> 10:04.269
I just can't help wondering

10:04.271 --> 10:06.238
why I have to set up chairs for church,

10:06.240 --> 10:09.341
even though I don't believe in God.

10:09.343 --> 10:12.213
Well, that's because your
only religion is chasing tail.

10:14.248 --> 10:16.115
And the Navy ain't gonna pay you for that.

10:31.132 --> 10:32.166
Incoming!

10:53.988 --> 10:55.990
Barbara!

10:56.490 --> 10:58.025
Barbara!

11:00.294 --> 11:02.229
Barbara, come here!

11:03.097 --> 11:04.997
Come on, sweetheart.

11:18.345 --> 11:19.845
Get the wounded below deck!

11:19.847 --> 11:21.348
Everyone else, battle stations!

11:37.431 --> 11:38.899
Get down!

11:46.807 --> 11:48.440
Comin' to church?

11:48.442 --> 11:50.110
I have to go to the office.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.046
It's Sunday.

11:54.048 --> 11:55.814
You work too hard.

12:04.491 --> 12:06.158
Layton residence.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.829
I'll meet you outside.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.331
Edwin, what's happening?

12:12.333 --> 12:13.934
The Japanese are attacking us.

12:15.503 --> 12:16.935
Did you reach the office?

12:16.937 --> 12:19.137
No. The switchboard was jammed.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.275
Go.

12:31.519 --> 12:33.787
Sully, get up! Come on!

12:35.422 --> 12:36.855
We need to get to the gun directors.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.459
They're firing way too low.

12:45.065 --> 12:47.001
Take cover! Get down!

13:03.083 --> 13:04.351
Drive!

13:06.621 --> 13:08.887
Hey. Hey.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.824
Are you okay?

13:29.009 --> 13:31.143
We have to get off the ship. Come on.

13:31.145 --> 13:32.146
Hurry up, kid.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.381
We gotta jump.

13:36.383 --> 13:37.585
You go in that water, you're dead.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.423
Sully! You first, Sully!

13:44.425 --> 13:46.291
I can't! My hands...

13:46.293 --> 13:47.627
You wanna live?

13:47.629 --> 13:50.164
You get to that goddamned
ship, you hear me?

14:01.576 --> 14:03.208
What is it, sir?

14:03.210 --> 14:06.144
Looks like Coastal
Artillery went stark mad.

14:06.146 --> 14:07.948
I bet you somebody's
gonna catch hell for it.

14:10.351 --> 14:12.086
Incoming!

14:15.923 --> 14:18.624
Miller, break radio silence.
Get that gun working!

14:18.626 --> 14:20.628
Pearl is under attack. This is no shit.

14:33.575 --> 14:34.875
Miller, you okay?

14:38.946 --> 14:40.013
Miller, bail out!

14:47.655 --> 14:50.222
Miller! Miller!

14:50.224 --> 14:51.593
Miller!

14:57.431 --> 14:59.064
What the hell is going on?

14:59.066 --> 15:00.666
Pearl is shooting at our guys, sir.

15:00.668 --> 15:02.167
Then maybe it isn't Pearl.

15:02.169 --> 15:03.368
Look, call Dickinson.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.103
We had a transmission
that he was under attack

15:05.105 --> 15:06.173
and then nothing.

15:09.109 --> 15:10.110
Sir.

15:13.147 --> 15:14.616
Get this to the admiral.

15:29.496 --> 15:31.165
Keep going, Sully.

15:44.512 --> 15:46.213
Get down!

15:55.189 --> 15:56.591
Oh, come on.

15:59.794 --> 16:02.027
There's the man who tried to warn us.

16:02.029 --> 16:04.764
If it's any satisfaction to
you, Layton, you were right.

16:04.766 --> 16:07.365
Sir, it's no satisfaction to me whatsoever.

16:20.347 --> 16:21.549
You bastard.

16:51.546 --> 16:53.345
Sir, where are they going?

16:53.347 --> 16:54.514
Back to their carriers.

16:54.516 --> 16:56.348
Drive out to the radio direction finder

16:56.350 --> 16:57.482
and report back to me.

16:57.484 --> 16:58.586
Yes, sir.

17:05.627 --> 17:07.261
<i>Admiral Halsey on deck.</i>

17:09.496 --> 17:10.695
Pearl found something?

17:10.698 --> 17:12.698
Intelligence managed
to get a line of bearing

17:12.700 --> 17:13.800
on the attacking fleet.

17:15.469 --> 17:17.402
But it's a bilateral reading.

17:17.404 --> 17:21.138
The Japanese are either at 343 degrees

17:21.141 --> 17:22.842
or 163 degrees.

17:22.844 --> 17:24.577
Oh, for Christ's sake.

17:24.579 --> 17:26.478
Pearl is under attack
and we don't even know

17:26.480 --> 17:28.280
if the bastards are north or south?

17:28.281 --> 17:31.553
Army bombers also reported a
possible ship sighting here.

17:33.555 --> 17:34.722
We're gonna place our bet

17:35.690 --> 17:37.322
right there.

17:37.324 --> 17:40.492
We have a possible
location on the Jap fleet.

17:40.494 --> 17:42.494
Fly a grid on bearing 185.

17:42.496 --> 17:43.495
If you make contact,

17:43.497 --> 17:45.463
Best and his men will
put down a smokescreen

17:45.465 --> 17:48.133
and then the torpedo
bombers will make their runs.

17:48.135 --> 17:49.569
Lindsey has command.

17:49.571 --> 17:51.671
Eh, to hell with smoke.

17:51.673 --> 17:54.172
Let me go after those
carriers with a real bomb.

17:54.174 --> 17:55.908
Torpedoes sink ships, not bombs,

17:55.910 --> 17:58.443
- and my men need a screen.
- Yeah, even if you get close enough,

17:58.445 --> 17:59.845
your torpedoes don't work.

17:59.847 --> 18:01.379
- That's a rumor.
- Yeah, it's a rumor,

18:01.381 --> 18:03.583
'cause the damn things
have never been tested.

18:03.585 --> 18:06.284
Look, the Japs are out
there killing our friends.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.753
Let me put a 500-pound bomb

18:07.755 --> 18:09.722
right down their goddamn smokestack.

18:09.724 --> 18:12.827
We're not changing tactics
just because you want revenge.

18:24.204 --> 18:26.404
Going after the Japs, sir?

18:26.406 --> 18:27.875
Yeah, we're gonna smoke 'em to death.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.300
Japanese are attacking on multiple fronts.

18:55.302 --> 18:57.402
We captured a radio log
from a downed Japanese plane.

18:57.404 --> 18:59.939
They hit us with all six
of their fleet carriers.

18:59.941 --> 19:02.340
At least they didn't destroy our oil tanks.

19:02.342 --> 19:05.243
The whole fleet would have had
to withdraw to the West Coast.

19:05.245 --> 19:06.979
You are the best intelligence officer

19:06.981 --> 19:08.413
I've ever known, Layton.

19:08.415 --> 19:10.250
They'll probably burn you for this, too.

19:10.918 --> 19:12.285
But if they don't,

19:12.987 --> 19:14.654
swear to me,

19:14.656 --> 19:17.290
you'll make the next man
in this chair listen to you.

19:22.229 --> 19:23.896
See anything, sir?

19:23.898 --> 19:25.633
Not even a goddamn whale.

19:34.542 --> 19:36.609
Six baker 10, this is six torpedo one.

19:36.611 --> 19:38.476
<i>Lead us back to</i> Enterprise.

19:38.478 --> 19:40.646
Six torpedo one, your pilots aren't trained

19:40.648 --> 19:43.015
for a night carrier
landing with live ordnance.

19:43.017 --> 19:44.517
<i>Go land at Pearl.</i>

19:44.519 --> 19:45.851
We can't clear the mountains.

19:45.853 --> 19:47.787
Take us back to
<i>Enterprise,</i> lieutenant.

19:47.789 --> 19:49.789
<i>That's an order.</i>

19:49.791 --> 19:52.290
Six torpedo one, I'm
dropping my smoke tanks

19:52.292 --> 19:53.693
and returning to <i>Enterprise.</i>

19:53.695 --> 19:54.696
Follow me if you want.

20:15.516 --> 20:17.282
We got word from Pearl.

20:17.284 --> 20:18.651
The Jap fleet was north,

20:18.653 --> 20:19.654
not south.

20:20.420 --> 20:21.522
God damn it!

20:41.374 --> 20:44.375
Hey, Lindsey, this is what I was afraid of.

20:44.377 --> 20:46.011
One of your men almost
blows up the damn carrier,

20:46.013 --> 20:47.079
because you were too afraid

20:47.081 --> 20:48.781
to get shot down flying into Pearl.

20:48.783 --> 20:50.381
Do I have to remind you

20:50.383 --> 20:52.685
that I am your superior
officer, lieutenant?

20:52.687 --> 20:54.587
You gonna hide behind your rank?

20:54.589 --> 20:55.688
Save it for the Japs.

20:55.690 --> 20:56.956
We're at war now, McClusky.

20:56.958 --> 20:59.390
- When that guy screws up, people die!
- Listen to me.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.093
You wanna keep flying?

21:01.095 --> 21:04.462
I suggest you knock
off the cowboy bullshit.

21:04.464 --> 21:05.600
Come on, Murray.

21:29.590 --> 21:30.591
Jesus.

21:32.627 --> 21:33.694
What are they doing?

21:35.029 --> 21:37.029
When she went over, everyone below deck

21:37.031 --> 21:38.866
was probably trapped inside.

21:43.871 --> 21:45.840
Did you know anyone aboard <i>Arizona?</i>

21:46.874 --> 21:47.875
Yeah,

21:49.744 --> 21:51.746
my roommate from the Academy.

21:52.713 --> 21:54.549
Lieutenant Roy Pearce.

22:07.695 --> 22:09.895
I heard you jumped out
of a perfectly good plane.

22:09.897 --> 22:11.564
Well, it was on fire.

22:11.566 --> 22:12.767
And the controls were dead.

22:14.401 --> 22:15.468
Where's Miller?

22:17.972 --> 22:19.339
Ah, hell.

22:20.074 --> 22:21.075
Yeah.

22:21.909 --> 22:23.476
Hey, Ann's by the gate.

22:24.812 --> 22:25.813
Are you okay?

22:27.014 --> 22:28.516
Yeah, I'm all right.

22:31.752 --> 22:32.854
- Hi.
- Hey.

22:34.188 --> 22:36.421
- Come home tonight.
- I wish.

22:36.423 --> 22:38.791
We sail as soon as we're refueled.

22:38.793 --> 22:40.192
Look, I want you and Barb to go back

22:40.194 --> 22:41.827
to your parents' place in Jersey.

22:41.829 --> 22:43.996
- No.
- It's not safe here.

22:43.998 --> 22:46.098
Everyone is saying this
is gonna be a long war.

22:46.100 --> 22:47.867
- What if...
- You're not shipping us

22:47.869 --> 22:49.704
off to Jersey and that's final.

22:51.706 --> 22:52.874
Did you talk to Sarah?

22:54.474 --> 22:55.743
Was Roy aboard the <i>Arizona?</i>

22:56.844 --> 22:57.845
Yes.

23:01.115 --> 23:02.648
We're checking all the hospitals,

23:02.650 --> 23:04.085
but nothing yet.

23:06.520 --> 23:07.755
Tell her I'll find him.

23:16.463 --> 23:17.464
Thank you.

23:18.599 --> 23:19.600
Hey.

23:22.536 --> 23:24.203
I heard you were with Lieutenant Pearce

23:24.205 --> 23:25.706
during the attack.

23:31.946 --> 23:32.980
Sully...

23:34.215 --> 23:35.716
what happened to him?

23:38.085 --> 23:39.086
I don't know.

23:40.955 --> 23:41.956
I don't know.

23:56.637 --> 23:57.536
We're doing our best.

23:57.538 --> 23:59.439
But they've been bringing body parts...

23:59.941 --> 24:01.208
in pillow cases.

24:02.243 --> 24:03.443
There's too many.

24:06.747 --> 24:08.247
He was a blond guy.

24:08.249 --> 24:11.016
Tall. Probably wearing
an officer's uniform.

24:11.018 --> 24:12.153
Officers are down here.

24:17.858 --> 24:20.626
Is there anything else you can give me?

24:20.628 --> 24:23.095
Identifying features? Tattoos?

24:23.097 --> 24:26.899
Well, he would have been
wearing our class ring

24:26.901 --> 24:27.935
from Annapolis.

24:48.589 --> 24:50.222
We, uh...

24:50.224 --> 24:53.027
took this off the body when he came in.

25:00.735 --> 25:01.736
I'm sorry.

25:02.603 --> 25:03.637
I'll give you a moment.

25:13.347 --> 25:17.616
<i>December 7th, 1941...</i>

25:17.618 --> 25:21.653
<i>a date which will live in infamy.</i>

25:21.655 --> 25:23.589
<i>The United States of America</i>

25:23.591 --> 25:26.358
<i>was suddenly and
deliberately attacked</i>

25:26.360 --> 25:31.797
<i>by naval and air forces
of the Empire of Japan.</i>

25:31.799 --> 25:35.934
<i>The United States was at
peace with that nation...</i>

25:35.936 --> 25:38.205
<i>and, at the solicitation of Japan...</i>

25:38.440 --> 25:39.872
Turn it off.

25:39.874 --> 25:42.274
<i>...was still in conversation</i>

25:42.276 --> 25:44.278
<i>with its government and its...</i>

25:46.571 --> 25:47.866
What's wrong?

25:50.919 --> 25:53.186
We have awakened a sleeping giant...

25:55.340 --> 25:57.965
and filled him with terrible resolve.

26:16.086 --> 26:17.737
Did you enjoy your visit to Hawaii?

26:18.201 --> 26:22.400
I told Nagumo to locate their aircraft
carriers and destroy their fuel tanks.

26:22.603 --> 26:24.002
But he refused.

26:24.507 --> 26:26.209
A devastating mistake.

26:26.651 --> 26:32.839
It would have taken the Americans a year
to resume operations at Pearl Harbor.

26:33.623 --> 26:36.487
When are you going to
remove Nagumo from command?

26:37.368 --> 26:39.959
Nagumo sunk the American battleships.

26:40.443 --> 26:42.283
Everyone thinks he's a hero.

26:42.285 --> 26:44.842
Someday that old fool will
make an even bigger mistake.

26:50.264 --> 26:52.195
None of that talk inside.

26:52.409 --> 26:55.226
We must be united against the Army.

26:55.438 --> 26:56.951
I'm not Nagumo.

27:15.135 --> 27:18.075
Pearl Harbor was a great victory.

27:18.849 --> 27:19.680
But...

27:20.774 --> 27:25.586
If we give them time the
Americans will overrun us.

27:27.779 --> 27:35.574
Therefore we must land the knockout blow
by destroying their aircraft carriers.

27:35.823 --> 27:37.289
Congratulations, sir.

27:37.291 --> 27:39.093
You're the right man to run the Navy.

27:40.928 --> 27:42.394
When they get in trouble,

27:42.396 --> 27:44.062
they send for the sons of bitches.

27:47.454 --> 27:51.437
Our priority must be...

27:51.974 --> 27:56.446
to seize the resources that we need.

27:56.448 --> 28:00.896
That is a job for the Army.

28:01.386 --> 28:04.301
The Navy's job...

28:05.100 --> 28:09.875
is to get us there and back.

28:13.294 --> 28:16.295
The situation in the Pacific is far worse

28:16.297 --> 28:18.096
than has been reported.

28:18.098 --> 28:19.431
We have three carriers.

28:19.433 --> 28:21.300
The Japs have ten.

28:21.302 --> 28:23.135
We have zero functional battleships,

28:23.137 --> 28:24.970
they have nine.

28:24.972 --> 28:28.042
They have more cruisers,
more bombers, more fighters...

28:29.009 --> 28:32.110
and much of their equipment is more modern.

28:32.112 --> 28:33.345
We'll just have to count on the men

28:33.347 --> 28:34.882
that we have out there

28:35.883 --> 28:37.550
to hold the line.

28:37.552 --> 28:39.853
I don't envy the new commander.

28:47.328 --> 28:48.896
It's me, isn't it?

28:50.898 --> 28:53.300
The president asked for you himself.

28:58.272 --> 29:00.105
He said

29:00.107 --> 29:02.810
that you should get the hell
out to Pearl and stay there

29:04.211 --> 29:06.347
until our ships sail into Tokyo Bay.

29:13.887 --> 29:16.290
Welcome to the most
difficult job in the world.

29:21.874 --> 29:24.150
The Army got us into this war...

29:24.356 --> 29:26.702
and now they expect us
to ferry them around.

29:27.363 --> 29:30.634
For now. But circumstances will change.

29:31.639 --> 29:36.446
I want you to start drawing up
plans for the operation we discussed.

29:38.435 --> 29:39.534
Midway?

29:48.455 --> 29:51.125
Detail.
A-ten-hut!

29:54.461 --> 29:55.462
Ready.

29:56.230 --> 29:57.362
Aim.

29:57.364 --> 29:58.365
Fire.

29:59.300 --> 30:01.033
Aim.

30:01.035 --> 30:02.301
Fire.

30:02.303 --> 30:03.337
I'll be right back.

30:04.506 --> 30:06.106
Fire.

30:10.911 --> 30:11.979
I'm so sorry.

30:13.280 --> 30:15.182
Roy wanted to be a pilot like you.

30:16.383 --> 30:18.250
But I talked him out of it.

30:18.252 --> 30:19.953
I said it was too dangerous.

30:23.591 --> 30:25.223
I'll see you at the next funeral.

30:25.225 --> 30:26.491
You don't have to go.

30:26.493 --> 30:27.595
Yes, I do.

30:29.029 --> 30:30.097
We're family.

30:34.134 --> 30:35.535
Hey, hey, hey!

30:35.537 --> 30:36.968
I just wanna say...

30:36.970 --> 30:39.404
Roy Pearce was one of the finest bastards

30:39.406 --> 30:41.006
that I've ever met.

30:41.008 --> 30:43.008
And I could talk about the man for an hour.

30:43.010 --> 30:44.943
But I think that's a job I'll
leave up to one of you boys

30:44.945 --> 30:46.180
that went to the Academy with him.

30:47.582 --> 30:49.549
What do you say?

30:49.551 --> 30:53.185
Yeah, well, I can't let some
torpedo jockey speak for Roy.

30:53.187 --> 30:55.253
Especially one not good enough
to fly from <i>Enterprise.</i>

30:55.255 --> 30:57.991
- Ooh!
- Okay. Okay.

31:03.497 --> 31:06.064
Summer after plebe year, me, Roy and Dickie

31:06.066 --> 31:09.134
went up to visit Roy's
uncle, up in the Great Lakes.

31:09.136 --> 31:10.402
It was the peak of Prohibition,

31:10.404 --> 31:12.304
so one night, we decide to sail to Canada

31:12.306 --> 31:14.139
to buy a keg of beer.

31:14.141 --> 31:16.110
On our way back, right
before the sun comes up,

31:17.044 --> 31:18.977
the wind dies.

31:18.979 --> 31:20.613
So, there we are,

31:20.615 --> 31:22.481
just floating in the middle of the lake,

31:22.483 --> 31:25.016
waiting for the Border Patrol to show up.

31:25.018 --> 31:27.287
I said we should just
ditch the booze, but Roy...

31:28.355 --> 31:29.555
Hey, Dickie,

31:29.557 --> 31:30.690
what did Roy say?

31:30.692 --> 31:33.024
"Hell, no.

31:33.026 --> 31:34.562
"We'll drink it all."

31:39.133 --> 31:40.602
Roy was my best man.

31:44.037 --> 31:46.006
He was the godfather to my daughter.

31:47.374 --> 31:48.510
I thought someday...

31:50.110 --> 31:51.644
we'd be on a porch, drinking beers,

31:51.646 --> 31:54.181
telling lies about what
we did in the big war.

32:01.723 --> 32:03.255
To Roy.

32:03.257 --> 32:04.990
To Roy.

32:04.992 --> 32:06.026
To Roy.

32:08.630 --> 32:09.995
Man, oh, man.

32:09.997 --> 32:11.664
Why'd you make me drink so much?

32:11.666 --> 32:13.231
You might have to carry me home, darling.

32:14.736 --> 32:16.303
Oh, shit. Shore Patrol.

32:17.672 --> 32:20.238
No, that's the admiral's flag.

32:20.240 --> 32:22.073
Hey, I bet it's the new commander.

32:22.075 --> 32:23.408
Who do you think it is?

32:23.410 --> 32:24.677
That looks like Nimitz.

32:24.679 --> 32:26.512
I hear he's true-blue.

32:26.514 --> 32:27.780
Hey, Nimitz!

32:27.782 --> 32:29.651
When are you going to let us at those Japs?

32:30.552 --> 32:32.050
I'm sorry, sir.

32:32.052 --> 32:33.220
Do you want me to get their names?

32:34.054 --> 32:35.187
No.

32:35.189 --> 32:36.321
I think he might have heard you.

32:37.458 --> 32:40.961
I'm glad at least some of
the boys still want to fight.

32:55.577 --> 32:57.108
Welcome to Pearl, sir.

32:57.110 --> 32:58.479
I'm Lieutenant Commander Layton.

33:00.080 --> 33:01.480
I know who you are.

33:01.482 --> 33:03.415
Well, then you'll understand my request.

33:03.417 --> 33:06.418
I wish to be reassigned to a destroyer.

33:06.420 --> 33:08.654
Didn't you try to warn my predecessor

33:08.656 --> 33:10.322
about the impending attack?

33:10.324 --> 33:12.357
Well, not exactly. I said

33:12.359 --> 33:14.560
that we had lost track
of the enemy carriers

33:14.562 --> 33:15.996
and needed to be prepared.

33:17.264 --> 33:18.600
I should've pushed harder.

33:20.133 --> 33:22.200
A lesson, I assume,

33:22.202 --> 33:23.703
you have taken to heart.

33:23.705 --> 33:25.103
Sir...

33:25.105 --> 33:27.205
I'm the intelligence officer responsible

33:27.207 --> 33:28.608
for overseeing the greatest

33:28.610 --> 33:31.311
intelligence failure in American history.

33:32.747 --> 33:33.748
Close the door.

33:36.584 --> 33:38.450
Morale is at an all-time low

33:38.452 --> 33:39.521
and for good reason.

33:41.355 --> 33:43.789
The Japanese are advancing on all fronts

33:43.791 --> 33:45.457
at a terrifying pace.

33:45.459 --> 33:46.859
I, nevertheless,

33:46.861 --> 33:49.531
know the fighting spirit of our men.

33:50.665 --> 33:52.798
And I have faith in them.

33:52.800 --> 33:56.167
But I also need to know

33:56.169 --> 33:58.205
that they have faith in themselves.

33:59.007 --> 34:01.507
I need you to be my Admiral Yamamoto.

34:01.509 --> 34:04.276
Get in his head. Tell me
what he's going to do next.

34:04.278 --> 34:06.311
Your first assignment...

34:06.313 --> 34:07.847
we need to throw a punch.

34:07.849 --> 34:09.014
Not just for morale,

34:09.016 --> 34:13.418
but so the Japanese know
what it feels like to be hit.

34:13.420 --> 34:16.722
I'm sending Halsey to
attack the Marshall Islands.

34:16.724 --> 34:17.790
But I need to know

34:17.792 --> 34:19.726
that they're not walking into a trap.

34:30.437 --> 34:32.270
<i>The target is Roi Island.</i>

34:32.272 --> 34:35.172
Our submarines have
reported shipping traffic

34:35.175 --> 34:36.876
and one military airfield.

34:36.878 --> 34:38.511
We don't know what we're facing,

34:38.513 --> 34:39.745
so hit 'em as hard as possible

34:39.746 --> 34:41.379
and then get the hell out.

34:41.380 --> 34:43.281
So what about the enemy carrier?

34:43.283 --> 34:45.685
Intelligence says they're 2,000 miles away.

34:45.687 --> 34:47.284
You mean the same group of geniuses

34:47.286 --> 34:49.254
who didn't know the Japs
were gunning for Pearl?

34:49.255 --> 34:50.487
Like I said,

34:50.489 --> 34:52.359
be prepared for anything.

34:56.163 --> 34:59.397
The early bird catches the worm, gentlemen.

34:59.399 --> 35:00.700
We're gonna hit that anchorage

35:00.702 --> 35:03.201
before the Japs have
even rolled out of bed.

35:03.203 --> 35:06.471
Looks like he spit polished his shoes.

35:06.473 --> 35:08.206
Hey, guys, let's get home in one piece.

35:08.208 --> 35:09.309
Oh, don't you worry.

35:12.379 --> 35:13.613
What's the plan, sir?

35:13.615 --> 35:15.815
The other squadrons will strike first.

35:15.817 --> 35:18.416
Then we go in and clean
up the remaining targets.

35:18.418 --> 35:19.919
Japs will know we're coming.

35:19.921 --> 35:21.554
What happens if we get shot down?

35:21.556 --> 35:24.389
Look, I'm not gonna end up as a POW.

35:24.391 --> 35:25.459
And neither are you.

35:33.768 --> 35:35.868
I've got a large target in my sight.

35:35.870 --> 35:37.270
Get close enough to make it count.

35:44.311 --> 35:46.480
Start your runs, boys. Engage torpedoes.

36:18.012 --> 36:21.214
Looks like our boys on
Roi poked a hornet's nest.

36:27.555 --> 36:28.688
We got a problem.

36:28.690 --> 36:31.791
I got eyes on a second enemy
airfield on Taroa Island.

36:31.793 --> 36:34.662
<i>I'm counting maybe 30 bombers
and heavy fighter cover.</i>

36:35.763 --> 36:37.295
You hear that, boys?

36:37.297 --> 36:38.931
If we don't knock out that airfield,

36:38.933 --> 36:40.733
they'll go after <i>Enterprise.</i>

36:40.735 --> 36:42.970
And I want a place to
land when this is over.

36:57.752 --> 36:59.618
Enemy fighters, 11 o'clock!

36:59.620 --> 37:01.488
We got company. Start your runs!

37:26.948 --> 37:28.415
3,000!

37:36.524 --> 37:38.023
2,000!

37:38.025 --> 37:39.592
1,900!

37:39.594 --> 37:40.760
1,800!

37:40.762 --> 37:41.763
1,600!

38:21.401 --> 38:23.838
Get those bastards off me, Murray!

39:28.636 --> 39:30.671
Let's get out of here, Murray.

39:38.846 --> 39:41.747
We got most of the bombers,
but not all of them.

39:41.749 --> 39:43.649
Looks like they almost got you.

39:43.651 --> 39:44.986
Yeah, not enough lead.

39:49.156 --> 39:50.990
What, too much excitement for ya?

39:50.992 --> 39:52.858
I'm not looking to win a medal.

39:52.860 --> 39:54.492
You know, the Navy's gonna

39:54.494 --> 39:56.494
make you pay for this aircraft.

39:56.496 --> 39:57.897
How'd you boys do?

39:57.899 --> 39:59.432
We lost Hopping.

40:00.501 --> 40:02.067
He never pulled out of his dive.

40:04.639 --> 40:06.138
That can't be good.

40:11.145 --> 40:13.047
Twin-engine bombers, five o'clock.

40:26.493 --> 40:27.458
Goddamn gunners.

40:27.460 --> 40:30.197
Don't they know they
gotta lead those planes?

40:36.604 --> 40:38.639
- Right standard rudder.
- Brace!

40:43.177 --> 40:44.645
Brace for impact!

41:05.766 --> 41:07.601
What the hell is he doing?

41:08.703 --> 41:10.738
He's turning himself into a bomb.

41:28.789 --> 41:30.024
Come on! Come on!

41:53.147 --> 41:54.013
Damn, Bruno.

41:54.015 --> 41:55.850
Aren't they paying us to kill Japs?

41:58.085 --> 41:59.553
Admiral Halsey wants to see you.

42:11.766 --> 42:14.268
That's the bravest damn
thing I think I've ever seen.

42:15.636 --> 42:16.935
What's your name, son?

42:16.937 --> 42:18.337
Bruno Gaido, sir.

42:18.339 --> 42:20.672
Aviation Machinist's Mate, Third Class.

42:20.674 --> 42:22.274
Well, Bruno, you are now

42:22.276 --> 42:25.146
an Aviation Machinist's Mate, First Class.

42:31.819 --> 42:32.718
Signal the fleet.

42:32.720 --> 42:34.853
Tell 'em it's time to haul ass with Halsey.

42:34.855 --> 42:36.255
Yes, sir.

42:36.257 --> 42:38.292
You heard the man. Signal the fleet.

42:55.109 --> 42:57.242
Are you really sure you want your wife

42:57.244 --> 42:58.679
flying wingman for you tonight?

42:59.847 --> 43:00.913
Yeah, nobody told me

43:00.915 --> 43:02.648
there'd be USO girls here tonight.

43:02.650 --> 43:03.749
- Hey.
- Hey.

43:03.751 --> 43:04.752
Hi.

43:05.352 --> 43:06.654
I got us a table.

43:10.891 --> 43:12.791
Wade, have you met Ann?

43:12.793 --> 43:14.093
Wade McClusky.

43:14.095 --> 43:15.329
I fly with your husband.

43:17.765 --> 43:19.832
Hey, uh, you want a drink?

43:19.834 --> 43:21.669
I do, if you want me to dance.

43:24.405 --> 43:26.674
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

43:28.309 --> 43:30.142
How long have you been married?

43:30.144 --> 43:33.679
Long enough to know my husband's talents.

43:33.681 --> 43:35.649
Why isn't he commanding a squadron?

43:37.151 --> 43:38.450
I don't make those decisions.

43:38.452 --> 43:40.719
- Two Mai Tai, please.
- Yes, sir.

43:40.721 --> 43:42.154
I understand before the war,

43:42.156 --> 43:43.891
when it was about politics, but now?

43:44.658 --> 43:46.859
I told you she was a firecracker.

43:48.195 --> 43:49.962
I have to say,

43:49.964 --> 43:52.297
I often wondered what kind of woman

43:52.299 --> 43:53.901
would marry Dick Best...

43:55.803 --> 43:57.171
and, well, you have not disappointed.

44:00.708 --> 44:01.809
Dick Best.

44:02.409 --> 44:04.443
- Hey, Layton.
- Hey.

44:04.445 --> 44:06.044
How was the Marshall Islands?

44:06.046 --> 44:07.648
Yeah, we got our feet wet.

44:09.917 --> 44:11.216
You keeping tabs on me?

44:11.218 --> 44:13.053
Ah, I'm with Fleet Intelligence.

44:13.754 --> 44:14.987
Thank God.

44:14.989 --> 44:17.258
Yeah, we're gonna need someone
as smart as you after Pearl.

44:18.759 --> 44:20.292
You gonna straighten those boys out?

44:20.294 --> 44:21.793
I'll do my best.

44:21.795 --> 44:23.395
Your Mai Tai, sir.

44:23.397 --> 44:25.232
Well, I'm rooting for you.

44:26.267 --> 44:28.035
- Hey, say hi to the wife.
- You as well.

44:28.969 --> 44:30.869
Just be straight with me.

44:30.871 --> 44:32.072
What am I missing?

44:33.841 --> 44:36.710
Every time we go up in one of those planes,

44:37.945 --> 44:39.313
there's a chance we won't come back.

44:40.414 --> 44:44.285
Now, it's hard to follow a
man who doesn't know that.

44:45.419 --> 44:46.787
Or even worse...

44:47.388 --> 44:48.389
doesn't care.

44:53.761 --> 44:54.993
Let's dance.

44:54.995 --> 44:56.161
Okay.

44:56.163 --> 44:57.329
Excuse me.

45:55.889 --> 45:56.890
Come to bed.

46:19.413 --> 46:21.048
Welcome aboard <i>Enterprise.</i>

46:21.915 --> 46:24.016
You're replacing good men.

46:24.018 --> 46:26.353
Much earlier than me or
the Navy wanted, but...

46:28.122 --> 46:29.524
Well, that's the hand we've been dealt.

46:30.558 --> 46:32.190
Now, you're going in the rotation,

46:32.192 --> 46:34.092
and as XO, it's my job to make sure

46:34.094 --> 46:36.230
you're worth more than
a bucket of warm spit.

46:37.097 --> 46:38.997
The Japs are waiting for us,

46:38.999 --> 46:41.099
so we need pilots who can hold their own.

46:42.436 --> 46:44.169
Hey.

46:44.171 --> 46:45.339
You gotta see this.

47:11.432 --> 47:14.835
What the hell are army
planes doing on a carrier?

47:18.305 --> 47:20.072
Well, Mr. Browning,

47:20.074 --> 47:22.508
the commander of those bombers?

47:22.510 --> 47:24.910
Lieutenant Colonel James Doolittle.

47:24.912 --> 47:27.045
Maybe the best pilot in the world.

47:27.047 --> 47:30.516
And he intends to launch his
planes off the <i>Hornet,</i>

47:30.518 --> 47:33.952
strike Tokyo, and then land in Free China.

47:33.954 --> 47:34.955
Captain?

47:39.393 --> 47:41.561
Enemy pickets 50 miles out.

47:41.563 --> 47:43.028
They're gonna blow our cover.

47:43.030 --> 47:45.364
Every mile we get
Doolittle closer to Japan,

47:45.366 --> 47:48.166
is fuel he can use to
get the hell out of there.

47:48.168 --> 47:50.304
But I'm not gonna risk these carriers.

47:51.405 --> 47:53.105
What do we tell Doolittle?

47:53.107 --> 47:54.341
The truth.

48:04.351 --> 48:06.019
We got the order to launch.

48:06.721 --> 48:08.122
How far out are we?

48:09.524 --> 48:11.657
Too far.

48:11.659 --> 48:14.228
We'll probably end up
ditching in the East China Sea.

48:15.362 --> 48:17.963
But if we bomb Tokyo,

48:17.965 --> 48:20.700
we'll be the first enemy in Japan's history

48:20.702 --> 48:23.368
to hit their home territory.

48:23.370 --> 48:25.272
If any of you want to bow out,

48:26.273 --> 48:27.542
now's your chance.

48:30.411 --> 48:32.479
We all wanna fly, sir.

48:34.616 --> 48:36.248
Man your planes.

48:36.250 --> 48:37.585
I'll see you all in China.

48:42.122 --> 48:44.222
They can't take off.

48:44.224 --> 48:45.525
Certainly not with a load.

48:45.527 --> 48:48.059
And they sure as hell can't land.

48:48.061 --> 48:50.563
Ten bucks says they don't
make it off the deck.

48:50.565 --> 48:51.699
Yeah, I'll take that bet.

49:35.442 --> 49:36.642
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

49:36.644 --> 49:37.710
<i>This is Radio Tokyo,</i>

49:37.712 --> 49:39.679
<i>talking about the collapse
of American forces</i>

49:39.681 --> 49:40.913
<i>in the Philippines.</i>

49:40.915 --> 49:43.081
<i>Our glorious Japanese forces
have captured thousands...</i>

49:43.083 --> 49:44.216
Evening, gents.

49:50.224 --> 49:52.090
What's going on, Captain?

49:52.092 --> 49:53.761
Those sound like air raid sirens to me.

50:07.341 --> 50:09.884
Heavenly sovereign, we must
get you down to the shelter.

50:22.524 --> 50:23.823
Bombs away, sir.

50:23.825 --> 50:25.225
Let's get out of here.

50:50.685 --> 50:52.618
- No.
- Taking these hostage.

50:52.620 --> 50:54.554
Just half an hour.

50:54.556 --> 50:56.154
Does America winning the war

50:56.156 --> 50:59.391
really depend on Edwin Layton
working himself to death?

50:59.393 --> 51:01.663
Some of our boys bombed Tokyo today.

51:03.865 --> 51:06.264
They were supposed to land in Free China.

51:06.266 --> 51:07.567
But they're probably gonna run out of fuel

51:07.569 --> 51:09.469
and have to ditch in the China Sea.

51:10.437 --> 51:12.538
If, by some miracle, they actually make it

51:12.540 --> 51:14.640
into Japanese occupied territory,

51:14.642 --> 51:16.243
they'll be tortured and executed.

51:18.211 --> 51:19.313
What can you do?

51:20.213 --> 51:21.315
Most likely nothing.

51:22.550 --> 51:23.916
But we're not gonna lose any more men

51:23.918 --> 51:25.485
because I didn't dig deep enough.

51:32.426 --> 51:33.595
I'll fix you a sandwich.

51:45.372 --> 51:46.739
I keep recalculating,

51:46.741 --> 51:48.641
but with this steady tailwind...

51:48.643 --> 51:49.811
You think we're over land?

51:50.678 --> 51:52.177
Yeah. Maybe.

51:54.849 --> 51:56.116
Only one way to find out.

52:07.662 --> 52:08.730
Everyone. We gotta bail out.

52:21.475 --> 52:24.209
I don't know if we're over
Chinese or Jap territory.

52:24.211 --> 52:25.477
So, watch yourselves.

52:25.479 --> 52:26.781
I'll see you all in Quzhou.

52:37.357 --> 52:38.392
You're next, Potter.

53:06.777 --> 53:08.078
Sir?

53:09.005 --> 53:10.660
Leave me.

53:11.666 --> 53:13.140
You must come out of your cabin.

53:13.355 --> 53:16.672
We put the Emperor's life at risk.

53:17.061 --> 53:19.071
It was only a handful of bombers.

53:19.778 --> 53:22.305
We swore to keep our homeland impenetrable.

53:22.697 --> 53:26.930
Everyone now agrees you were
right about the American carriers.

53:27.146 --> 53:28.757
We must destroy them.

53:29.120 --> 53:33.097
Tojo says we must finish our
operation in the Coral Sea.

53:33.343 --> 53:36.511
But then we can turn
our attention to Midway.

53:43.412 --> 53:46.594
Then we have work to do.

53:50.765 --> 53:53.331
You have a train station...

53:53.333 --> 53:54.934
Smoke comes out. Train?

53:54.936 --> 53:56.434
I'm a friend.

53:56.436 --> 53:58.436
American. I'm an ally.

53:58.438 --> 53:59.805
I need to get to Quzhou.

53:59.807 --> 54:00.808
Quzhou.

54:01.776 --> 54:02.977
- Hello.
- Hello.

54:04.011 --> 54:06.612
My name is Zhu Xuesan.

54:06.614 --> 54:07.847
School teacher.

54:07.849 --> 54:10.315
You are American?

54:10.317 --> 54:11.519
American. I bombed Japan yesterday.

54:12.385 --> 54:14.352
Where... Where's the plane?

54:14.354 --> 54:15.420
It crashed.

54:15.422 --> 54:17.489
I bailed out and landed
in the water last night.

54:17.491 --> 54:19.459
Where's, uh, para... parachute?

54:20.561 --> 54:21.827
I left it at the shore.

54:21.829 --> 54:22.895
Ask them.

54:22.897 --> 54:24.532
I knocked on their door
in the middle of the night.

54:33.975 --> 54:35.777
He say you lie.

54:38.679 --> 54:40.045
He want your gun.

54:43.785 --> 54:45.483
I'm an American officer.

54:45.485 --> 54:46.552
I keep my gun.

54:52.425 --> 54:55.295
You bomb Japan?

54:57.732 --> 54:58.733
I sure did.

54:59.901 --> 55:01.934
- Welcome. Welcome.
- Hi.

55:01.936 --> 55:03.102
I need to get to Quzhou.

55:03.104 --> 55:04.737
- To Quzhou.
- Quzhou.

55:04.739 --> 55:06.040
- Quzhou.
- Quzhou.

55:06.874 --> 55:08.741
Yeah.

55:08.743 --> 55:10.876
The Japanese are sending their carriers

55:10.878 --> 55:12.445
into the Coral Sea.

55:12.880 --> 55:13.946
Yes, sir.

55:13.948 --> 55:16.617
They're trying to break
our lifeline with Australia.

55:21.022 --> 55:23.622
Send a secure message to Admiral Halsey.

55:23.624 --> 55:24.757
I want <i>Enterprise</i> to join

55:24.759 --> 55:27.092
<i>Yorktown</i> and
<i>Lexington</i> in the Coral Sea.

55:27.094 --> 55:29.695
And tell Halsey time is a factor.

55:29.697 --> 55:30.896
There's something else.

55:30.898 --> 55:32.598
There always is.

55:32.600 --> 55:33.766
I heard a theory.

55:33.768 --> 55:35.134
What kind of theory?

55:35.136 --> 55:36.467
According to one of my officers,

55:36.469 --> 55:37.636
Coral Sea is just a warm-up.

55:37.638 --> 55:39.905
He thinks that the Japanese
are planning something bigger.

55:39.907 --> 55:41.040
Much bigger.

55:41.042 --> 55:42.641
What makes him think that?

55:42.643 --> 55:45.443
Little bits and pieces
that we've intercepted.

55:45.445 --> 55:47.012
A message about a
battleship not being ready

55:47.014 --> 55:48.479
for an upcoming operation.

55:48.481 --> 55:50.549
Request for maps of the Aleutian Islands.

55:50.551 --> 55:51.717
What's the target?

55:51.719 --> 55:52.720
We don't know yet.

55:53.721 --> 55:56.121
Do you trust this officer?

55:56.123 --> 55:58.557
He's the most brilliant man I know.

55:58.559 --> 56:00.360
Well, have him figure it out.

56:04.031 --> 56:05.800
Always no match.

56:16.677 --> 56:17.812
Keep it.

56:18.445 --> 56:19.511
Thank you.

56:48.809 --> 56:50.410
There are no installations here.

56:51.913 --> 56:53.545
What's their target?

56:53.547 --> 56:54.947
People are target.

56:54.949 --> 56:56.817
People.

56:59.520 --> 57:01.086
People.

57:01.088 --> 57:02.657
And we just made it worse.

57:09.797 --> 57:10.963
I have to go.

57:10.965 --> 57:12.800
My family.

57:13.768 --> 57:15.169
They... They take you Quzhou.

57:16.170 --> 57:17.571
Help find your men.

57:18.005 --> 57:19.571
Thank you.

57:19.573 --> 57:20.875
For everything.

57:39.527 --> 57:42.528
24 hours too late.

57:42.530 --> 57:44.532
Damn it. Why couldn't we have been here?

57:45.666 --> 57:46.832
This leaves us and <i>Hornet</i>

57:46.834 --> 57:48.502
as the only carriers in the Pacific.

57:55.209 --> 57:56.544
Attention on deck.

58:00.047 --> 58:02.984
I wanna talk to McClusky and Best.

58:08.055 --> 58:09.690
As you were.

58:12.793 --> 58:14.662
Oh, for Christ's sake.

58:15.896 --> 58:17.629
You okay, Admiral?

58:17.631 --> 58:19.133
I got this damn rash.

58:20.234 --> 58:22.968
Listen up. I'm done playing politics.

58:22.970 --> 58:24.003
The Navy...

58:24.005 --> 58:27.806
hell, the whole damn
country is counting on us.

58:27.808 --> 58:30.242
And I need my best men in the right spots.

58:30.244 --> 58:31.846
So, McClusky,

58:33.180 --> 58:35.549
you are now in charge of the air group.

58:36.317 --> 58:37.950
I don't have a lick of confidence

58:37.952 --> 58:39.651
in those damn torpedoes.

58:39.653 --> 58:41.022
So, I want you in a dive bomber.

58:42.990 --> 58:44.123
And, Best,

58:44.125 --> 58:45.893
I'm bumping you up from XO.

58:47.928 --> 58:50.164
You're the new skipper of Bombing Six.

58:52.266 --> 58:53.601
Good luck, boys.

58:56.904 --> 58:59.273
Well, I guess you're gonna
have to learn to fly an SBD.

59:00.241 --> 59:02.875
I've logged plenty of
hours in the Dauntless.

59:02.877 --> 59:05.010
Not diving at a live target.

59:05.012 --> 59:06.311
Can't be that hard.

59:06.313 --> 59:08.549
I mean, you do it.

59:11.395 --> 59:15.447
How dare you! You're not
following our strategy.

59:25.666 --> 59:27.207
Admiral Nagumo.

59:28.425 --> 59:30.997
This is no way to conduct a war game.

59:32.512 --> 59:36.363
These young men have ignored the
battle doctrines. I followed your plan.

59:37.322 --> 59:41.563
We attacked Midway with our carriers.

59:41.890 --> 59:48.930
We were ready to pivot as soon as the
American carriers responded from Pearl Harbor.

59:52.175 --> 59:53.137
But?

59:55.369 --> 59:58.688
My American carriers
didn't come from Pearl.

59:59.578 --> 01:00:02.294
They were waiting here,
northeast of Midway Island.

01:00:02.572 --> 01:00:08.824
While Admiral Nagumo's planes were bombing
Midway, I sunk three of his carriers.

01:00:10.536 --> 01:00:15.442
Such a move is impossible because the
Americans won't know we are coming.

01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:20.875
Start again.

01:00:23.414 --> 01:00:27.299
But this time the American
carriers must come from Pearl.

01:00:32.933 --> 01:00:35.167
So, I just got off the
phone with Washington,

01:00:35.169 --> 01:00:36.835
and their intelligence guys

01:00:36.837 --> 01:00:39.338
think you're wrong
about this big operation.

01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:41.340
They think that the Japs
are sending their carriers

01:00:41.342 --> 01:00:42.741
back into the Coral Sea.

01:00:42.743 --> 01:00:45.377
Yeah, and they've ordered me to
keep <i>Enterprise</i> down there.

01:00:45.379 --> 01:00:46.345
That's a mistake.

01:00:46.347 --> 01:00:48.914
Washington is starting
from a faulty assumption

01:00:48.916 --> 01:00:51.350
and looking for evidence to corroborate it.

01:00:51.352 --> 01:00:53.287
So, what's the Japs' real target?

01:00:53.854 --> 01:00:55.721
We believe it's Midway.

01:00:55.723 --> 01:00:57.756
They see our base there
as a step towards Hawaii

01:00:57.758 --> 01:00:59.293
and eventually the West Coast.

01:01:00.394 --> 01:01:01.727
When?

01:01:01.729 --> 01:01:02.863
In a few weeks.

01:01:05.266 --> 01:01:06.865
I think it's time to pay a visit

01:01:06.867 --> 01:01:08.367
to your friends in Station HYPO.

01:01:08.369 --> 01:01:10.137
Matt, bring the car around.

01:01:21.115 --> 01:01:23.882
I have to warn you, sir,
codebreakers are a rare breed.

01:01:23.884 --> 01:01:26.218
Rochefort's way of doing
things is especially...

01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:27.452
particular.

01:01:27.454 --> 01:01:29.922
I don't care if he consults coffee grounds

01:01:29.924 --> 01:01:31.123
while doing the boogie-woogie

01:01:31.125 --> 01:01:33.192
as long as the intel is good.

01:01:33.194 --> 01:01:34.328
Attention on deck.

01:01:35.496 --> 01:01:36.797
Carry on, gentlemen.

01:01:39.366 --> 01:01:40.401
Where's Rochefort?

01:01:42.903 --> 01:01:44.803
If you'll follow me, sir.

01:01:44.805 --> 01:01:46.071
Didn't realize that the Navy

01:01:46.073 --> 01:01:48.473
had so many trained codebreakers.

01:01:48.475 --> 01:01:49.676
We don't.

01:01:49.678 --> 01:01:52.377
Most of these men were in the
band on the <i>California.</i>

01:01:52.379 --> 01:01:55.414
But since we don't have much
use for bands these days,

01:01:55.416 --> 01:01:57.182
Rochefort thought that
their musical abilities

01:01:57.184 --> 01:01:58.283
might make them naturals

01:01:58.285 --> 01:02:00.221
at breaking the rhythms of ciphers.

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:15.200
Sorry, Admiral, it, uh,

01:02:15.202 --> 01:02:17.338
gets cold down here in the dungeon.

01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:20.140
I'm told you're brilliant.

01:02:23.177 --> 01:02:24.910
Well, Lieutenant Commander Layton

01:02:24.912 --> 01:02:27.212
has been known to exaggerate.

01:02:27.214 --> 01:02:29.081
I hope not.

01:02:29.083 --> 01:02:30.882
He told me he's absolutely certain

01:02:30.884 --> 01:02:32.117
the Japs are gonna hit Midway

01:02:32.119 --> 01:02:33.287
and I need to know

01:02:34.054 --> 01:02:36.355
whether or not I can believe him.

01:02:36.357 --> 01:02:37.823
Well, if you don't believe him,

01:02:37.825 --> 01:02:38.926
we'll all be speaking Japanese.

01:02:40.461 --> 01:02:42.463
Or, most likely, we'll be dead.

01:02:46.967 --> 01:02:48.068
Show me how this works.

01:02:48.603 --> 01:02:50.235
You mean, like a tour?

01:02:50.237 --> 01:02:51.305
Exactly.

01:02:52.039 --> 01:02:53.405
Like a tour.

01:02:53.407 --> 01:02:54.873
So, this is where it starts.

01:02:54.875 --> 01:02:56.908
We intercept roughly 60%

01:02:56.910 --> 01:02:58.477
of secure Japanese radio traffic

01:02:58.479 --> 01:03:00.112
and we've cracked enough of their code

01:03:00.114 --> 01:03:03.081
to be able to break about
40% of those messages.

01:03:03.083 --> 01:03:05.317
So, we're able to read about a quarter

01:03:05.319 --> 01:03:07.185
of their secure communications?

01:03:07.187 --> 01:03:09.421
Uh, no, not exactly.

01:03:09.423 --> 01:03:11.256
Here's some of our, uh,

01:03:11.258 --> 01:03:12.960
cracked messages.

01:03:15.062 --> 01:03:16.995
It's gibberish to me.

01:03:16.997 --> 01:03:19.431
Yes, but if you read enough of it...

01:03:19.433 --> 01:03:21.466
Rochefort has a gift for
assembling the fragments.

01:03:21.468 --> 01:03:23.536
He can recall a message
from two months ago,

01:03:23.538 --> 01:03:26.071
and plug it into today's intercept.

01:03:26.073 --> 01:03:27.975
Explain the disagreement with Washington.

01:03:29.043 --> 01:03:30.008
Well,

01:03:30.010 --> 01:03:33.546
we all have access to
the same raw information,

01:03:33.548 --> 01:03:36.917
but, uh, over here, is
where our paths diverge.

01:03:37.885 --> 01:03:39.184
Translation and analysis.

01:03:39.186 --> 01:03:40.352
Now, Washington agrees with us

01:03:40.354 --> 01:03:43.355
that Japs are gonna attack
a major target codenamed AF.

01:03:43.357 --> 01:03:45.190
But Washington believes that AF

01:03:45.192 --> 01:03:46.626
is located in the South Pacific,

01:03:46.628 --> 01:03:49.995
which is why they ordered you to
keep <i>Enterprise</i> down there.

01:03:49.997 --> 01:03:52.565
Do you have any direct
proof that they're wrong?

01:03:52.567 --> 01:03:53.934
Direct proof? No, but...

01:03:55.269 --> 01:03:56.470
Sir.

01:03:57.938 --> 01:04:00.038
Imagine that you're throwing a wedding.

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:02.207
And maybe I've never seen the invitation,

01:04:02.209 --> 01:04:03.342
but I hear from the caterers

01:04:03.344 --> 01:04:05.277
that they have an event on a certain date.

01:04:05.279 --> 01:04:07.379
The flower guy is buying up all the roses

01:04:07.381 --> 01:04:08.514
on the island.

01:04:08.516 --> 01:04:10.449
The best band is booked.

01:04:10.451 --> 01:04:13.187
That's what signal
intelligence can give you.

01:04:13.621 --> 01:04:15.253
Clues.

01:04:15.255 --> 01:04:17.122
Not a definitive answer.

01:04:17.124 --> 01:04:20.125
Sir? After Pearl, you told
me to stick to my guns.

01:04:20.127 --> 01:04:22.329
I swear to you, Joe's right about this.

01:04:25.999 --> 01:04:28.400
I'm not generally predisposed

01:04:28.402 --> 01:04:31.203
to trust a bunch of tuba players

01:04:31.205 --> 01:04:34.540
led by a man wearing fuzzy slippers.

01:04:34.542 --> 01:04:36.341
But...

01:04:36.343 --> 01:04:38.678
I'll figure a way to get the
<i>Enterprise</i> back here.

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:43.150
Meantime, you gentlemen
need to convince Washington

01:04:44.552 --> 01:04:47.587
that the Japs' real target is Midway.

01:04:47.589 --> 01:04:48.487
How, sir?

01:04:48.489 --> 01:04:50.489
Washington doesn't exactly have a habit

01:04:50.491 --> 01:04:51.659
of listening to us.

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:54.895
Well, I'm sure you'll think of something.

01:05:03.571 --> 01:05:04.572
Come in.

01:05:08.375 --> 01:05:10.444
An eyes-only message from Pearl.

01:05:17.519 --> 01:05:18.520
Nimitz.

01:05:19.687 --> 01:05:22.053
He wants us to be spotted.

01:05:22.055 --> 01:05:24.022
Because if the Japs see us,

01:05:24.024 --> 01:05:25.591
we can break our standing orders

01:05:25.593 --> 01:05:27.695
with Washington and return to Pearl.

01:05:31.231 --> 01:05:33.400
We never received this message.

01:05:37.337 --> 01:05:39.039
<i>Sir? The admiral needs you.</i>

01:05:42.510 --> 01:05:43.511
Okay.

01:05:44.144 --> 01:05:46.445
Yeah. Okay.

01:05:46.447 --> 01:05:47.715
Well, keep me informed.

01:05:49.149 --> 01:05:50.482
That was Washington.

01:05:50.484 --> 01:05:53.285
They've intercepted
several Japanese messages

01:05:53.287 --> 01:05:55.690
claiming that the target
of their upcoming attack

01:05:56.256 --> 01:05:58.190
is out of fresh water.

01:05:58.192 --> 01:06:00.292
Interesting, sir.

01:06:00.294 --> 01:06:03.195
I heard that Midway accidentally sent out

01:06:03.197 --> 01:06:04.764
an unencrypted transmission

01:06:04.766 --> 01:06:07.232
that their water plant was broken.

01:06:07.234 --> 01:06:08.703
And is their water plant broken?

01:06:10.237 --> 01:06:12.103
Not that I know of, sir.

01:06:12.105 --> 01:06:14.141
But that proves Midway is AF.

01:06:18.045 --> 01:06:19.812
Okay, tell your man, Rochefort

01:06:19.814 --> 01:06:21.213
that everyone now agrees

01:06:21.215 --> 01:06:23.248
on where his wedding is gonna be held.

01:06:23.250 --> 01:06:26.251
We just need to know how
many guests are coming

01:06:26.253 --> 01:06:29.122
and when they plan to arrive.

01:06:49.644 --> 01:06:51.511
Mack, I think we found the spot.

01:06:51.513 --> 01:06:52.578
Can't say, Mr. Ford,

01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:54.680
that I've ever helped a
big-time Hollywood director

01:06:54.682 --> 01:06:56.448
scout for a movie before.

01:06:56.450 --> 01:06:57.750
What kind of film you planning to make

01:06:57.752 --> 01:06:59.852
in a godforsaken place like this?

01:06:59.854 --> 01:07:01.721
Friend of mine in the Navy said

01:07:01.723 --> 01:07:04.790
that I might be able to
find some real action here.

01:07:04.792 --> 01:07:06.826
I think I've been hoodwinked.

01:07:06.828 --> 01:07:07.727
I don't know, sir. From the way

01:07:07.729 --> 01:07:09.695
we've been fortifying this little island,

01:07:09.697 --> 01:07:12.132
I'd say your friend has some good intel.

01:07:14.636 --> 01:07:16.270
Attention on deck.

01:07:18.472 --> 01:07:19.473
Very funny.

01:07:20.575 --> 01:07:21.709
Sit the hell down.

01:07:25.145 --> 01:07:26.812
I'm gonna keep this short.

01:07:26.814 --> 01:07:27.880
I know some of you thought

01:07:27.882 --> 01:07:30.816
I was a pain in the ass as XO...

01:07:30.818 --> 01:07:32.785
Well, that's about to get worse.

01:07:32.787 --> 01:07:34.787
We're headed back to Pearl to resupply,

01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:36.354
and it's probably because something big

01:07:36.356 --> 01:07:38.390
is coming down the pipe.

01:07:38.392 --> 01:07:40.358
I'm therefore doubling our scouting flights

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:42.360
and I expect you to practice diving runs

01:07:42.362 --> 01:07:44.262
whenever you get a chance.

01:07:44.264 --> 01:07:46.164
Don't be the man who lets down the squadron

01:07:46.166 --> 01:07:47.769
when we finally face the Japs.

01:07:49.671 --> 01:07:50.672
Dismissed.

01:07:59.279 --> 01:08:00.480
Can I talk to you, sir?

01:08:04.251 --> 01:08:05.553
I don't know if I can do this, sir.

01:08:06.219 --> 01:08:08.188
I thought I was a good pilot,

01:08:09.423 --> 01:08:11.526
but I've lost my confidence.

01:08:14.562 --> 01:08:16.263
Why did you become a pilot?

01:08:17.932 --> 01:08:21.265
Your dad wanted you to be an officer, huh?

01:08:21.268 --> 01:08:24.572
Actually, my dad didn't have
much respect for officers.

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:26.772
Said that most of them didn't know

01:08:26.774 --> 01:08:28.140
their ass from their elbow.

01:08:30.277 --> 01:08:32.444
You know, my dad was
a tough son of a bitch.

01:08:32.446 --> 01:08:34.680
You know how I got his respect?

01:08:34.682 --> 01:08:36.316
By always staying in the fight.

01:08:37.752 --> 01:08:38.917
I wish I had the luxury

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:40.920
of worrying about your confidence,

01:08:40.921 --> 01:08:42.322
but we're short on pilots,

01:08:43.357 --> 01:08:44.390
so, you gotta suck it up.

01:08:46.594 --> 01:08:47.595
Yes, sir.

01:08:48.595 --> 01:08:49.596
Wait.

01:08:54.201 --> 01:08:56.502
From now on, you're my wingman.

01:08:56.504 --> 01:08:58.537
I'll be lookin' out for you.

01:08:58.538 --> 01:09:00.508
Now go suit up for a scouting flight.

01:09:03.745 --> 01:09:04.746
Tell me.

01:09:05.712 --> 01:09:06.714
What's your secret?

01:09:07.615 --> 01:09:08.881
My secret?

01:09:08.883 --> 01:09:10.818
He wants to know why nothing bothers you.

01:09:12.587 --> 01:09:15.287
My uncle was a welder on
the Empire State Building.

01:09:15.790 --> 01:09:16.788
He'd walk on a beam,

01:09:16.791 --> 01:09:19.658
1,000 feet up in the
sky, no ropes, nothing.

01:09:19.661 --> 01:09:21.627
And everyone thought he was crazy,

01:09:21.629 --> 01:09:23.529
but to him, he was just doing a job.

01:09:23.531 --> 01:09:25.564
And one Sunday, he's
walking home from church.

01:09:25.566 --> 01:09:26.832
He's a block away from his house,

01:09:26.834 --> 01:09:29.702
when a cab jumps over the curb,

01:09:29.703 --> 01:09:31.504
splatters him like a bug.

01:09:31.506 --> 01:09:32.874
You never know what's gonna get you.

01:09:33.774 --> 01:09:35.308
So, why worry about it?

01:09:37.679 --> 01:09:39.781
Hey. Let's go.

01:09:41.549 --> 01:09:43.348
Simple scouting mission.

01:09:43.350 --> 01:09:45.718
On the way home, we'll
practice the dive, you got it?

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:46.786
Yes, sir.

01:09:46.787 --> 01:09:48.252
We'll be going deeper this time,

01:09:48.255 --> 01:09:50.022
so don't pull up too fast on the bottom

01:09:50.024 --> 01:09:51.288
or you'll black out.

01:10:11.311 --> 01:10:12.645
Oh, shit.

01:10:12.647 --> 01:10:14.515
The ship's moving too slow.

01:10:41.509 --> 01:10:43.878
Abort! Abort takeoff!

01:10:46.379 --> 01:10:47.682
<i>The ship's too slow!</i>

01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:51.083
We're not generating
enough wind for launch.

01:10:51.085 --> 01:10:53.453
No, stop! Stop!

01:11:07.702 --> 01:11:08.834
Plane in water.

01:11:08.836 --> 01:11:10.102
<i>Plane in water.</i>

01:11:10.104 --> 01:11:11.904
Turn starboard, God damn it!

01:11:11.906 --> 01:11:13.273
<i>Turn starboard.</i>

01:11:51.512 --> 01:11:54.013
Guess you don't like the chokers either.

01:11:54.015 --> 01:11:57.817
I'd get grease on that thing
just trying to button it up.

01:11:57.819 --> 01:12:00.485
Makes me look like a damn waiter.

01:12:00.487 --> 01:12:03.088
Nobody would ever confuse you for a waiter.

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.528
You look like hell, Bill.

01:12:08.062 --> 01:12:09.730
I'm fine.

01:12:10.698 --> 01:12:12.397
Tired.

01:12:12.399 --> 01:12:14.033
Every man on the ship's tired.

01:12:14.035 --> 01:12:15.968
We've been out six months without a break.

01:12:15.970 --> 01:12:16.969
There's a big difference

01:12:16.971 --> 01:12:20.139
between tired and
whatever the hell you are.

01:12:20.141 --> 01:12:23.008
You're going ashore to the hospital.

01:12:23.010 --> 01:12:25.144
Does this look like a battle wound to you?

01:12:25.146 --> 01:12:26.846
It's a damn rash.

01:12:26.848 --> 01:12:28.914
Now, what are my men gonna think

01:12:28.916 --> 01:12:30.749
when their admiral up and decides

01:12:30.751 --> 01:12:32.051
he needs a vacation?

01:12:32.053 --> 01:12:33.654
It's a direct order, Bill.

01:12:43.064 --> 01:12:44.732
And we keep losing men.

01:12:45.299 --> 01:12:46.634
It's not even the Japs.

01:12:47.702 --> 01:12:49.134
Herman crashed on takeoff.

01:12:49.136 --> 01:12:50.838
Tom Durkin disappeared on patrol.

01:12:51.505 --> 01:12:53.007
And there's this other kid...

01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:55.977
Willie West.

01:12:57.078 --> 01:12:58.978
He didn't think he could cut it.

01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:00.748
I figured it was just the usual jitters.

01:13:01.716 --> 01:13:03.383
I take him under my wing.

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:08.486
I wrote a letter to his mother yesterday

01:13:08.488 --> 01:13:10.024
telling her I failed him.

01:13:19.233 --> 01:13:20.835
It's not your fault.

01:13:21.836 --> 01:13:23.137
He was right to be scared.

01:13:25.039 --> 01:13:27.740
Everybody knows something big is coming.

01:13:27.742 --> 01:13:29.208
We're talking about a couple dozen planes

01:13:29.210 --> 01:13:31.543
against the whole Japanese fleet.

01:13:31.545 --> 01:13:33.581
And if we lose, they own the Pacific,

01:13:34.248 --> 01:13:37.016
and they raid the West Coast.

01:13:37.018 --> 01:13:39.787
Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles...

01:13:41.022 --> 01:13:42.655
will burn.

01:13:42.657 --> 01:13:44.792
And this damn war will last a decade.

01:13:47.494 --> 01:13:49.429
I've never seen you this worried before.

01:13:50.564 --> 01:13:53.034
I never had to worry when it
was just me and my plane...

01:13:55.903 --> 01:13:57.972
but, Ann, it's different
now. I have to lead these men.

01:14:00.141 --> 01:14:02.074
What do I say to them?

01:14:02.076 --> 01:14:03.110
Just...

01:14:04.011 --> 01:14:05.046
be honest.

01:14:06.681 --> 01:14:08.816
And let them see what I can see.

01:14:11.285 --> 01:14:13.854
They'll follow you anywhere, Dick Best.

01:14:34.008 --> 01:14:35.741
<i>Sir, the</i> Yorktown <i>was hit</i>

01:14:35.743 --> 01:14:37.276
<i>by a 500-pound bomb.</i>

01:14:37.278 --> 01:14:39.278
We need at least two weeks for repairs.

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:41.013
Not acceptable.

01:14:41.015 --> 01:14:44.051
Our initial estimate was three
months in dry dock in Seattle.

01:14:49.090 --> 01:14:51.223
I need this ship.

01:14:51.225 --> 01:14:55.594
I don't care if you need to
patch the deck with plywood.

01:14:55.596 --> 01:14:58.199
<i>Yorktown</i> sails in 72 hours.

01:15:00.868 --> 01:15:02.634
Halsey is out.

01:15:02.636 --> 01:15:04.269
He's in the hospital with shingles.

01:15:04.271 --> 01:15:06.939
So I've given command of Task Force 16

01:15:06.941 --> 01:15:08.240
to Admiral Spruance.

01:15:08.242 --> 01:15:09.675
We're setting a trap.

01:15:09.677 --> 01:15:11.343
Our carriers will lie in wait

01:15:11.345 --> 01:15:12.945
northeast of Midway.

01:15:12.947 --> 01:15:16.915
Now, we have set up a picket
line of submarines here.

01:15:16.917 --> 01:15:18.150
As for Midway itself,

01:15:18.152 --> 01:15:21.353
we have crammed every plane
we can spare onto that runway.

01:15:21.355 --> 01:15:23.856
But this time, if we're lucky,

01:15:23.858 --> 01:15:25.793
surprise will be on our side.

01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:30.696
Layton, how reliable are these estimates

01:15:30.698 --> 01:15:32.164
of the Japanese positions?

01:15:32.166 --> 01:15:33.932
They represent our best guess,

01:15:33.934 --> 01:15:35.834
based on the intelligence that we have.

01:15:35.836 --> 01:15:39.238
I can't plan around your guess.

01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:42.107
I understand that we're
asking the impossible,

01:15:42.109 --> 01:15:44.276
but we need you to be specific.

01:15:46.881 --> 01:15:49.615
The Japanese will attack
on the morning of June 4th

01:15:49.617 --> 01:15:53.619
from the northwest, at
a bearing of 325 degrees.

01:15:53.621 --> 01:15:56.321
They will be sighted 175 miles from Midway

01:15:56.323 --> 01:15:58.125
at 0700 local time.

01:16:00.928 --> 01:16:03.030
I trust Layton and his team.

01:16:03.898 --> 01:16:05.332
Make your plans accordingly.

01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:07.334
Dismissed.

01:16:10.671 --> 01:16:11.703
<i>Clear the deck.</i>

01:16:11.705 --> 01:16:14.740
<i>Torpedo Squadron Six
coming in from Pearl.</i>

01:16:14.742 --> 01:16:15.774
<i>Clear the deck.</i>

01:16:15.776 --> 01:16:18.345
<i>Torpedo Squadron Six
coming in from Pearl.</i>

01:16:25.219 --> 01:16:26.821
He's in trouble.

01:16:29.423 --> 01:16:30.624
Shit.

01:16:33.994 --> 01:16:36.361
<i>We need a rescue team!</i>

01:16:36.363 --> 01:16:38.363
- Easy. Easy. Easy.
- Easy, boys. Easy.

01:16:40.067 --> 01:16:41.333
Get him over.

01:16:41.335 --> 01:16:42.835
Hand him off. One, two, three.

01:16:42.837 --> 01:16:44.937
Easy, Lieutenant.

01:16:44.939 --> 01:16:46.107
How's your back doing, Lieutenant?

01:16:47.108 --> 01:16:49.643
It feels like someone
dropped a tractor on it.

01:16:52.079 --> 01:16:54.913
So, that's what your
squadrons are up against?

01:16:54.915 --> 01:16:56.415
Four carriers.

01:16:56.417 --> 01:16:58.784
Approximately 250 aircraft,

01:16:58.786 --> 01:17:00.419
plus the biggest battleship in the world.

01:17:00.421 --> 01:17:03.055
Yeah, not to mention
the Japs are unbeatable.

01:17:03.057 --> 01:17:04.992
We've got the drop on the bastards.

01:17:06.093 --> 01:17:07.128
Make it count.

01:17:10.097 --> 01:17:11.363
How's Lindsey?

01:17:11.365 --> 01:17:12.399
Not good, sir.

01:17:21.809 --> 01:17:23.408
Do you trust the intelligence?

01:17:23.410 --> 01:17:24.544
I'm trying.

01:17:24.546 --> 01:17:27.312
Because we're betting a
hell of a lot on this hand.

01:17:27.314 --> 01:17:28.313
Yeah.

01:17:28.315 --> 01:17:30.651
I can't believe I'm saying this, but, uh...

01:17:32.353 --> 01:17:34.153
I liked you better when you were cocky.

01:17:34.155 --> 01:17:35.754
Hey, you don't have to worry about me.

01:17:35.756 --> 01:17:37.189
Oh, really?

01:17:37.191 --> 01:17:39.760
You've been blaming yourself
for that kid who went down.

01:17:41.295 --> 01:17:43.862
How do I make it right?

01:17:43.864 --> 01:17:46.832
Make sure your men are ready for tomorrow.

01:17:46.834 --> 01:17:49.001
And you bring back as
many of 'em as you can.

01:17:51.138 --> 01:17:52.139
Ship sighted.

01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:01.146
It's the <i>Yorktown!</i>

01:18:04.285 --> 01:18:05.150
How the hell

01:18:05.152 --> 01:18:07.054
did she get out of dry dock in time?

01:18:07.788 --> 01:18:09.421
I don't know.

01:18:09.423 --> 01:18:11.857
I guess every battle needs a miracle.

01:18:11.859 --> 01:18:12.860
Whoo!

01:18:14.361 --> 01:18:16.361
You've memorized every position

01:18:16.363 --> 01:18:18.096
on that board, Layton.

01:18:18.098 --> 01:18:19.164
Go home.

01:18:19.166 --> 01:18:21.534
I think I'm going to
spend the night here, sir,

01:18:21.536 --> 01:18:23.070
just in case anything comes up.

01:18:24.038 --> 01:18:25.938
Your wife doesn't mind?

01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:27.839
Well, she knows the drill.

01:18:27.841 --> 01:18:30.411
My wife knows the drill,
too, but she still minds.

01:18:32.379 --> 01:18:33.278
And when the war's over,

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:34.980
I plan on spending the rest of my life

01:18:34.982 --> 01:18:35.983
making it up to her.

01:18:37.484 --> 01:18:39.017
Get some rest.

01:18:39.019 --> 01:18:40.020
Good night.

01:19:04.378 --> 01:19:06.579
They've scrambled all the squadrons.

01:19:06.581 --> 01:19:09.114
Radar must've picked up something.

01:19:09.116 --> 01:19:11.950
That's great, Mikey, that's great.

01:19:11.952 --> 01:19:14.152
Next time, get the horn up
a little higher, all right?

01:19:14.154 --> 01:19:15.555
- All right, sir.
- A little higher. Good.

01:19:15.557 --> 01:19:17.124
All right. Lower the
flag, we're going again.

01:19:21.061 --> 01:19:22.463
Get something in your stomachs.

01:19:23.998 --> 01:19:25.399
It's gonna be a long day.

01:19:33.274 --> 01:19:35.374
I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, boys.

01:19:35.376 --> 01:19:38.212
Nobody thinks we can go
toe-to-toe with the Japanese.

01:19:39.046 --> 01:19:40.281
Not in a fair fight.

01:19:42.016 --> 01:19:44.018
Today, we're gonna be big underdogs.

01:19:44.451 --> 01:19:45.450
Me?

01:19:45.452 --> 01:19:48.420
I think the men in this
room can fly with anyone.

01:19:48.422 --> 01:19:50.791
Maybe that's 'cause I'm
a cocky son of a bitch.

01:19:52.893 --> 01:19:55.129
But it's also because
I've seen what you can do.

01:19:58.566 --> 01:20:00.034
You're ready for this.

01:20:08.142 --> 01:20:10.475
We're gonna give 'em a shellackin'.

01:20:49.316 --> 01:20:51.684
They're coming! The Japs are coming!

01:20:51.686 --> 01:20:54.052
Mr. Ford, we have incoming aircrafts.

01:20:54.054 --> 01:20:55.320
We need to get you to a bunker.

01:20:56.990 --> 01:20:59.124
Incoming aircrafts?

01:20:59.126 --> 01:21:00.595
Sir, you have to take cover, sir.

01:21:02.930 --> 01:21:04.930
Holy shit! To the roof!

01:21:04.932 --> 01:21:06.499
Mr. Ford, wait!

01:21:06.501 --> 01:21:08.100
With all due respect, sir,

01:21:08.102 --> 01:21:09.267
there isn't going to be a movie, sir,

01:21:09.269 --> 01:21:10.135
if we don't get you to cover.

01:21:10.137 --> 01:21:12.638
I'm gonna shoot the damn picture.

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:13.641
Got it, Jackie?

01:21:14.308 --> 01:21:15.510
Beautiful!

01:21:34.495 --> 01:21:35.628
Are you okay?

01:21:35.630 --> 01:21:37.632
Keep shooting. Keep shooting!

01:21:42.970 --> 01:21:44.704
Japanese air attack reported on Midway.

01:21:44.706 --> 01:21:46.674
And one of our scout planes
just sighted the enemy fleet.

01:21:47.107 --> 01:21:48.440
Spotted where?

01:21:48.442 --> 01:21:50.610
He reports carriers bearing 320 degrees,

01:21:50.612 --> 01:21:53.679
180 miles northwest of Midway.

01:21:53.681 --> 01:21:56.248
Well, Layton, you and
Rochefort were only off

01:21:56.250 --> 01:21:58.684
five minutes, five miles and five degrees.

01:21:58.686 --> 01:22:00.588
Well, we'll endeavor to
do better next time, sir.

01:22:02.256 --> 01:22:04.022
Give our pilots the enemy position.

01:22:04.024 --> 01:22:05.157
Tell them to attack.

01:22:05.159 --> 01:22:06.293
Yes, sir.

01:22:24.012 --> 01:22:28.109
Enemy spotted! Nine o'clock!

01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:45.586
They're glide bombing.

01:22:47.807 --> 01:22:49.804
Which means they're amateurs.

01:22:50.284 --> 01:22:52.287
Prepare for evasive action.
Even amateurs can get lucky.

01:22:53.082 --> 01:22:55.191
Turn to port.

01:23:13.104 --> 01:23:14.457
Turn to starboard.

01:23:28.681 --> 01:23:30.482
He's aiming for the Akagi.

01:23:56.151 --> 01:23:58.251
Was he trying to hit us?

01:23:58.493 --> 01:24:00.510
Americans aren't that brave.

01:24:01.276 --> 01:24:03.591
His controls must have locked up.

01:24:05.531 --> 01:24:09.965
Those planes came from Midway,
which means it's still a threat.

01:24:10.997 --> 01:24:12.801
We must launch a second
attack on their airfields.

01:24:17.190 --> 01:24:18.292
Hey, Lindsey,

01:24:19.459 --> 01:24:21.561
you still owe me 10 bucks.

01:24:21.563 --> 01:24:24.597
You trying to collect before
I get myself shot down?

01:24:24.599 --> 01:24:26.699
Nah, I know you're good for it, Lindsey.

01:24:26.701 --> 01:24:28.668
You don't have to fly today.

01:24:28.670 --> 01:24:30.870
Nobody would doubt your courage.

01:24:30.872 --> 01:24:32.774
I will lead my squadron in.

01:24:38.580 --> 01:24:39.812
Good luck, sir.

01:24:39.814 --> 01:24:41.413
I'll be right behind you.

01:24:41.415 --> 01:24:43.618
I'll meet you at the Japanese fleet.

01:24:59.636 --> 01:25:01.268
Enemy fleet spotted!

01:25:09.172 --> 01:25:16.339
Sir! Ten enemy surface units spotted.

01:25:17.545 --> 01:25:19.817
Position east northeast.

01:25:22.078 --> 01:25:23.219
Impossible.

01:25:25.496 --> 01:25:27.788
Unless it's a trap.

01:25:38.411 --> 01:25:40.476
We must destroy the enemy fleet.

01:25:41.723 --> 01:25:45.688
Rearm the planes that were going to attack
Midway with torpedoes and armor-piercing bombs.

01:25:46.359 --> 01:25:49.286
But sir, we will be vulnerable
while we change weapons.

01:25:49.494 --> 01:25:50.979
Our fighters will keep us safe!

01:26:11.539 --> 01:26:13.338
They got a <i>Jintsu</i> type cruiser.

01:26:13.340 --> 01:26:14.540
Range 2,500 yards.

01:26:14.542 --> 01:26:16.509
I'm not wasting a torpedo on a cruiser.

01:26:16.511 --> 01:26:17.512
Where are the carriers?

01:26:27.021 --> 01:26:28.587
Sir, we need to go deep.

01:26:28.589 --> 01:26:29.590
Man battle stations.

01:26:30.992 --> 01:26:33.491
Battle stations. Everybody, in your bunks.

01:26:40.300 --> 01:26:41.536
Well, Murray,

01:26:42.302 --> 01:26:43.571
this is it.

01:27:22.309 --> 01:27:23.876
The <i>Enterprise</i> has launched its SBDs

01:27:23.878 --> 01:27:25.811
and their squadrons of marine dive bombers

01:27:25.813 --> 01:27:27.949
following a new sighting
report out of Midway.

01:27:32.419 --> 01:27:34.620
<i>We gotta climb higher, boys.</i>

01:27:34.622 --> 01:27:36.289
We need to conserve fuel.

01:27:38.492 --> 01:27:41.093
Approaching altitude 14,000 feet.

01:27:41.095 --> 01:27:42.797
Release your oxygen, sir.

01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:54.405
Are you okay, sir?

01:27:54.407 --> 01:27:56.341
It's my oxygen.

01:27:56.343 --> 01:27:58.077
Must've gotten a bad mix.

01:27:58.079 --> 01:27:59.545
We have to go back.

01:27:59.547 --> 01:28:00.946
It'll tear up your lungs.

01:28:00.948 --> 01:28:02.882
I'm not sending the squadron out there

01:28:02.884 --> 01:28:04.652
without their commander.

01:28:05.887 --> 01:28:07.853
There she is.

01:28:07.855 --> 01:28:10.055
We got a carrier, maybe 4,000 yards.

01:28:10.057 --> 01:28:11.891
Sir, the Japs are right on us.

01:28:11.893 --> 01:28:13.526
Make tubes one and two ready.

01:28:13.528 --> 01:28:15.594
Make tubes one and two
ready in all respects.

01:28:15.596 --> 01:28:17.563
Make tubes one and two
ready in all respects.

01:28:17.565 --> 01:28:18.699
Tubes one and two ready, aye.

01:28:23.805 --> 01:28:25.037
Flood down tube one.

01:28:25.039 --> 01:28:26.040
Flood down tube one, aye.

01:28:34.145 --> 01:28:36.186
Sir! Periscope spotted.

01:28:36.188 --> 01:28:37.675
They're deploying depth charges.

01:28:40.121 --> 01:28:41.321
Bearing.

01:28:43.791 --> 01:28:44.792
Mark.

01:28:52.498 --> 01:28:55.379
An American submarine right
in the middle of our fleet.

01:28:57.572 --> 01:28:59.104
- Matched.
- Tube one.

01:28:59.106 --> 01:29:00.373
Fire!

01:29:22.897 --> 01:29:25.405
Order the Arashi to
pin down that submarine.

01:29:25.599 --> 01:29:29.090
They can catch up to us once
the fleet is safely out of range.

01:29:33.507 --> 01:29:35.674
Six Baker 10, do you have visual?

01:29:38.779 --> 01:29:39.945
Nothin'.

01:29:39.947 --> 01:29:43.082
Must've gotten a bum sighting report.

01:29:43.084 --> 01:29:45.119
Or maybe they've changed course.

01:29:46.687 --> 01:29:48.388
Let's do a back search.

01:29:50.558 --> 01:29:51.592
Here they come again.

01:30:16.617 --> 01:30:18.183
Target spotted.

01:31:15.143 --> 01:31:16.628
Brave men.

01:31:17.263 --> 01:31:19.721
We are fortunate they have such bad planes.

01:31:23.876 --> 01:31:25.153
Right full rudder.

01:31:30.057 --> 01:31:31.258
The screws are fading.

01:31:32.727 --> 01:31:34.059
I think they're leaving, sir.

01:31:34.061 --> 01:31:35.596
Take us to periscope depth.

01:31:46.073 --> 01:31:48.542
Enemy destroyer's headed back to her fleet.

01:32:00.788 --> 01:32:02.221
I've got a ship.

01:32:02.223 --> 01:32:04.056
Jap destroyer at flank speed.

01:32:04.058 --> 01:32:04.957
What do you wanna bet

01:32:04.959 --> 01:32:06.658
she's trying to catch up with the carriers?

01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:07.993
<i>Sir, we've been up here</i>

01:32:07.995 --> 01:32:09.061
<i>for almost two hours.</i>

01:32:09.063 --> 01:32:10.662
What if we run out of fuel

01:32:10.664 --> 01:32:12.133
and the whole squadron has to ditch?

01:32:13.100 --> 01:32:14.366
Then I'll probably end up

01:32:14.368 --> 01:32:15.970
scrubbing potatoes at Leavenworth.

01:32:17.271 --> 01:32:18.704
To hell with it.

01:32:18.706 --> 01:32:19.707
Follow me, boys.

01:32:29.183 --> 01:32:31.316
I hope you're right, McClusky.

01:32:31.318 --> 01:32:33.554
Bombing Six on me.

01:32:50.638 --> 01:32:52.371
Think they've seen us?

01:32:52.373 --> 01:32:54.842
When they see us, we'll know.

01:33:11.425 --> 01:33:13.127
Brace for impact!

01:33:18.565 --> 01:33:21.724
We can't launch our bombers
because of these constant attacks.

01:33:30.511 --> 01:33:33.130
Our fighters need to stop glory hunting.

01:33:33.913 --> 01:33:35.743
They're all flying too low.

01:33:36.911 --> 01:33:39.228
Those planes came from a carrier.

01:33:40.156 --> 01:33:43.091
We must initiate an attack.

01:33:46.217 --> 01:33:48.206
A message from Admiral Yamaguchi, sir.

01:33:48.622 --> 01:33:51.241
Consider it advisable to
launch attack force immediately.

01:33:52.984 --> 01:33:54.814
What does he think I'm trying to do?

01:33:55.085 --> 01:33:56.840
Genda, what's our status?

01:33:56.842 --> 01:33:57.952
Yes, right away.

01:34:00.111 --> 01:34:01.421
Are the preparations ready?

01:34:01.847 --> 01:34:06.413
We're going as fast as we can, sir. But it
takes time to change from land weapons to sea.

01:34:07.506 --> 01:34:08.572
You have five minutes.

01:34:13.666 --> 01:34:15.653
This place is a powder keg.

01:34:24.265 --> 01:34:26.499
God damn it. That
magnificent son of a bitch

01:34:26.501 --> 01:34:27.966
actually found them.

01:34:27.968 --> 01:34:29.434
<i>All right, boys.</i>

01:34:29.436 --> 01:34:32.173
<i>Bombing Six, we've got
the first bastard in line.</i>

01:34:40.141 --> 01:34:41.721
They're almost finished.

01:34:42.942 --> 01:34:46.156
Good. We will launch a full attack
and crush the enemy task force.

01:34:56.096 --> 01:34:58.032
Mr. Best, watch out!

01:35:02.136 --> 01:35:03.268
What the hell?

01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:05.871
<i>McClusky was supposed to
go for the far carrier.</i>

01:35:05.873 --> 01:35:07.074
Stay on me.

01:35:27.328 --> 01:35:28.862
At 4,000.

01:35:45.980 --> 01:35:47.212
3,000!

01:35:47.214 --> 01:35:48.880
Do it, baby, come on!

01:35:48.882 --> 01:35:49.883
Come on!

01:35:55.956 --> 01:35:57.091
2,000!

01:36:02.196 --> 01:36:03.964
1,800!

01:36:47.107 --> 01:36:49.575
Come on, Dickinson, do
what you're paid to do.

01:37:01.288 --> 01:37:02.354
Whoo!

01:37:02.356 --> 01:37:05.023
Yeah!

01:37:10.110 --> 01:37:11.165
Look!

01:37:12.181 --> 01:37:13.466
The Soryu is also under attack.

01:37:13.468 --> 01:37:15.096
Calm yourself. You're an officer.

01:37:28.745 --> 01:37:30.997
That leaves just us and the Akagi.

01:37:36.010 --> 01:37:38.369
Unless those planes strike.

01:37:40.595 --> 01:37:43.228
<i>Feeling a little lonely, sir?</i>

01:37:43.230 --> 01:37:45.330
Wish we'd brought more planes to the party.

01:37:45.332 --> 01:37:47.999
<i>You always wanted to
be a hero, Kroeger.</i>

01:37:48.001 --> 01:37:49.403
Now's your chance.

01:38:22.236 --> 01:38:23.468
Okay, Murray.

01:38:23.470 --> 01:38:25.538
We put that carrier out of action

01:38:25.540 --> 01:38:27.509
even if we have to crash on her deck.

01:38:37.619 --> 01:38:38.620
4,000!

01:38:39.444 --> 01:38:40.933
We need more time, sir!

01:38:40.935 --> 01:38:42.690
We're still rearming the bombers!

01:38:56.538 --> 01:38:58.205
3,000!

01:39:34.241 --> 01:39:35.242
1,800!

01:39:38.312 --> 01:39:39.446
1,600!

01:39:44.351 --> 01:39:46.186
1,500!

01:40:11.513 --> 01:40:13.445
That was a beauty, sir!

01:40:13.447 --> 01:40:15.182
Right on her deck!

01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:34.334
Any fighters on our tail?

01:40:35.870 --> 01:40:37.202
No, sir.

01:40:37.204 --> 01:40:38.506
They must be chasing someone else.

01:41:27.254 --> 01:41:28.288
We're going in!

01:41:36.798 --> 01:41:39.464
O'Flaherty and Gaido are down, sir.

01:41:39.466 --> 01:41:41.333
If you don't hit them damn Zeros,

01:41:41.335 --> 01:41:42.369
we're gonna be joining 'em.

01:41:58.285 --> 01:41:59.453
Are you okay, sir?

01:42:01.254 --> 01:42:02.822
Radio our position.

01:42:02.824 --> 01:42:03.956
We gotta get a ship out here

01:42:03.958 --> 01:42:05.660
to pick up Gaido and O'Flaherty.

01:42:31.618 --> 01:42:33.075
The gasoline is vaporizing.

01:42:33.317 --> 01:42:36.422
We can't activate the
CO2. We have no power.

01:43:00.304 --> 01:43:01.521
We must go.

01:43:03.456 --> 01:43:05.160
I have to save the ship.

01:43:07.796 --> 01:43:11.703
It's the captain's job to save
the ship. Your duty is to lead.

01:43:15.711 --> 01:43:17.573
And you can't do that from here.

01:43:25.305 --> 01:43:27.472
Do you want us to contact Admiral Spruance?

01:43:27.474 --> 01:43:29.744
No, he can't break radio silence.

01:43:32.446 --> 01:43:33.447
For me?

01:43:37.985 --> 01:43:41.419
Rochefort intercepted a Japanese signal.

01:43:41.421 --> 01:43:44.355
He can't translate the body,
but look at the call sign.

01:43:44.357 --> 01:43:45.691
That's from Admiral Nagumo.

01:43:45.693 --> 01:43:47.292
But he's not transmitting
from the <i>Akagi.</i>

01:43:47.294 --> 01:43:48.661
He's transmitting from a cruiser.

01:43:48.663 --> 01:43:50.798
Now, why the hell would
Nagumo leave his flagship?

01:44:03.109 --> 01:44:08.187
From Admiral Nagumo. Fires are raging
aboard the Kaga, Soryu and Akagi.

01:44:19.924 --> 01:44:23.763
The Americans knew we were coming.

01:44:25.849 --> 01:44:29.978
We walked right into their trap.

01:44:39.771 --> 01:44:41.349
We can still win...

01:44:45.689 --> 01:44:48.740
But we must know what we are facing.

01:44:51.692 --> 01:44:53.358
They taught us about dehydration

01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:54.427
in flight school.

01:44:55.029 --> 01:44:56.929
Your skin starts to crack,

01:44:56.931 --> 01:44:58.063
liver fails...

01:44:58.065 --> 01:45:00.398
Knock it off.

01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:01.434
What if nobody finds us?

01:45:02.537 --> 01:45:03.704
We swim back to Pearl.

01:45:05.506 --> 01:45:06.641
Good luck with sharks.

01:45:07.575 --> 01:45:09.010
We'll need something to eat.

01:45:12.780 --> 01:45:14.414
Wait. Wait, I see something.

01:45:16.150 --> 01:45:18.117
Looks like a destroyer.

01:45:18.119 --> 01:45:19.654
American or Jap?

01:45:37.038 --> 01:45:40.105
You, tell us your ship,

01:45:40.107 --> 01:45:41.976
or we throw you overboard.

01:45:43.443 --> 01:45:44.444
Cigarette?

01:45:59.927 --> 01:46:02.530
You know, I had a lot of
friends at Pearl Harbor.

01:46:05.066 --> 01:46:07.602
So how about you go fuck yourself?

01:46:55.260 --> 01:47:01.086
We are the last intact
aircraft unit in the fleet.

01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:04.908
So the fate of Japan rests on your skill.

01:47:06.414 --> 01:47:08.737
The Emperor expects you to do your duty.

01:47:22.677 --> 01:47:25.277
Murray, get something to eat.

01:47:25.279 --> 01:47:27.579
I bet we're going back out there.

01:47:27.581 --> 01:47:29.617
We have to go upstairs to report.

01:47:30.151 --> 01:47:31.517
Hey, what happened?

01:47:31.519 --> 01:47:33.218
I got strafed by a Zero.

01:47:33.220 --> 01:47:36.221
Hey, how'd you know to
follow that Jap destroyer?

01:47:36.223 --> 01:47:38.057
I played a hunch.

01:47:38.059 --> 01:47:40.726
Well, your hunch might
have won us this battle.

01:47:40.728 --> 01:47:42.995
But I gotta tell ya,

01:47:42.997 --> 01:47:46.532
that looked like some
cowboy bullshit to me.

01:47:46.534 --> 01:47:48.667
Well, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.

01:47:49.971 --> 01:47:51.205
<i>Yorktown's</i> hit.

01:47:52.740 --> 01:47:53.939
What have we got left?

01:47:53.941 --> 01:47:55.808
Couple of SBDs just returned.

01:47:55.810 --> 01:47:57.209
The pilots are coming up to report.

01:47:59.146 --> 01:48:01.680
What's the news from the enemy fleet?

01:48:01.682 --> 01:48:03.549
Three carriers down. One to go.

01:48:03.551 --> 01:48:04.817
And our air group?

01:48:04.819 --> 01:48:06.752
Only three torpedo bombers came back,

01:48:06.754 --> 01:48:07.953
and they're all shot up.

01:48:07.955 --> 01:48:09.755
What about the dive bombers?

01:48:09.757 --> 01:48:12.124
We can probably scrounge up a dozen.

01:48:12.126 --> 01:48:14.326
McClusky, you've been shot.

01:48:14.328 --> 01:48:16.595
- I can fly, sir.
- The hell you can.

01:48:16.597 --> 01:48:18.065
Get your ass down to sick bay.

01:48:21.135 --> 01:48:23.035
Put the pilots you trust

01:48:23.037 --> 01:48:24.937
in any plane that can fly.

01:48:24.939 --> 01:48:25.973
Yes, sir.

01:48:30.111 --> 01:48:31.877
You okay, sir?

01:48:31.879 --> 01:48:34.015
I'm fine.

01:48:49.130 --> 01:48:51.165
Has anybody heard from Dickinson?

01:48:51.832 --> 01:48:53.198
No.

01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:54.900
Not yet.

01:48:54.902 --> 01:48:57.803
Look, I know you boys have
just been through hell.

01:48:57.805 --> 01:49:00.041
But we gotta go back
and hit the last carrier.

01:49:13.020 --> 01:49:14.789
I'll see if I can find more men.

01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:33.641
Hey.

01:49:35.109 --> 01:49:36.110
Strap up.

01:49:37.244 --> 01:49:39.645
We're going back out.

01:49:39.647 --> 01:49:40.746
I'm sorry, sir, but I think

01:49:40.748 --> 01:49:43.115
you need to find somebody else.

01:49:43.117 --> 01:49:45.984
You don't know what it's like
to be in the back seat, sir.

01:49:45.986 --> 01:49:47.922
You fly like you don't
care if we come home.

01:49:59.934 --> 01:50:02.101
I wanna go home, too.

01:50:02.103 --> 01:50:05.005
I wanna spend more than a few
days at a time with my wife.

01:50:05.906 --> 01:50:07.875
See my little girl grow up.

01:50:08.442 --> 01:50:09.777
And you're right.

01:50:11.412 --> 01:50:13.378
If we go out there,

01:50:13.380 --> 01:50:15.316
we probably aren't coming back.

01:50:16.217 --> 01:50:18.016
But this is our job,

01:50:18.018 --> 01:50:20.018
and we're the guys who
have to hold the fort

01:50:20.020 --> 01:50:21.689
till the cavalry arrives.

01:50:25.426 --> 01:50:27.394
Look, if you really can't fly,

01:50:28.329 --> 01:50:30.095
I'll find someone else.

01:50:30.097 --> 01:50:33.232
But you should get back in that plane.

01:50:33.234 --> 01:50:36.335
You'll remember this moment
for the rest of your life.

01:50:36.337 --> 01:50:38.237
And if you know that you came through

01:50:38.239 --> 01:50:40.172
when people were counting on you,

01:50:40.174 --> 01:50:42.009
you'll be able to face anything.

01:50:54.355 --> 01:50:56.157
We've come this far, Murray.

01:50:57.424 --> 01:50:59.360
Don't make me go back
out there without you.

01:51:12.973 --> 01:51:14.241
I'll warm her up, sir.

01:51:19.050 --> 01:51:22.372
The enemy has lost a carrier
and their air wings are weakened.

01:51:24.547 --> 01:51:29.708
We will draw them within range of
our battleships and destroy them.

01:51:31.261 --> 01:51:33.018
It's a bold plan.

01:51:34.656 --> 01:51:36.189
Radio Admiral Yamaguchi.

01:51:40.767 --> 01:51:42.648
Telegram from battlefield commander.

01:51:47.531 --> 01:51:50.047
Yamamoto is ordering us to charge.

01:51:50.391 --> 01:51:52.526
Like samurai trying to save our honor.

01:51:56.171 --> 01:51:57.486
So it shall be.

01:52:12.399 --> 01:52:13.566
Get ready, Murray.

01:52:13.568 --> 01:52:15.869
We're not sneaking up on them this time.

01:52:18.439 --> 01:52:20.074
Here they come!

01:53:28.909 --> 01:53:30.142
Altitude.

01:53:30.144 --> 01:53:31.979
We've got Zeroes on our tail.

01:54:24.666 --> 01:54:25.866
This is for Pearl.

01:55:09.276 --> 01:55:10.277
You're gonna be okay.

01:55:12.580 --> 01:55:13.648
Thanks, boys.

01:55:16.183 --> 01:55:17.416
What happened to you?

01:55:17.418 --> 01:55:19.587
I ran out of fuel about 20 miles out.

01:55:20.722 --> 01:55:22.222
Ditched next to the Phelps.

01:55:24.258 --> 01:55:25.392
Where's Best?

01:55:26.393 --> 01:55:27.961
That's one of his wingmen.

01:55:28.696 --> 01:55:30.464
He hasn't come back yet.

01:55:31.999 --> 01:55:34.669
He's probably just taking a victory lap.

01:55:39.507 --> 01:55:40.508
Yeah.

01:55:44.244 --> 01:55:45.245
Hey.

01:55:47.582 --> 01:55:49.181
Men like Dick Best are the reason

01:55:49.183 --> 01:55:50.284
we're gonna win this war.

01:56:06.133 --> 01:56:07.569
Come on, Best.

01:56:19.279 --> 01:56:20.546
Any news?

01:56:20.548 --> 01:56:21.814
The kids are out back.

01:56:21.816 --> 01:56:23.016
Go, go.

01:56:24.418 --> 01:56:25.419
Hi.

01:56:27.287 --> 01:56:29.223
Cindy heard a rumor from the base.

01:56:30.057 --> 01:56:31.423
There's a big battle

01:56:31.425 --> 01:56:33.626
and one of our carriers is sinking.

01:56:33.628 --> 01:56:35.561
And the pilots?

01:56:35.563 --> 01:56:38.063
It sounds like we lost a lot of them.

01:56:38.065 --> 01:56:40.735
I am gonna go powder my nose quickly.

01:57:03.123 --> 01:57:06.124
The Japanese might charge
with their battleships.

01:57:06.126 --> 01:57:09.127
So we will withdraw for the night.

01:57:09.129 --> 01:57:11.396
But their fleet might be
out of range in the morning.

01:57:11.398 --> 01:57:13.666
Nimitz ordered us to be judicious.

01:57:13.668 --> 01:57:15.570
We won a great victory today.

01:57:17.137 --> 01:57:18.405
Let's not blow it.

01:57:58.580 --> 01:58:00.147
God damn it! Dick Best!

01:58:04.819 --> 01:58:06.418
Hang in there, kid.

01:58:06.420 --> 01:58:07.722
We're almost home.

01:58:25.540 --> 01:58:27.272
I thought you were dead.

01:58:27.274 --> 01:58:28.876
Yeah. They said the same thing about you.

01:58:30.645 --> 01:58:31.746
I'm glad they were wrong.

01:58:34.582 --> 01:58:36.247
Admiral's orders.

01:58:36.249 --> 01:58:37.384
Give it to Murray.

01:58:37.885 --> 01:58:38.886
He earned it.

01:58:41.689 --> 01:58:43.256
Give me your hand.

01:58:46.259 --> 01:58:47.427
You okay?

01:58:50.798 --> 01:58:51.799
Yeah.

01:58:52.867 --> 01:58:54.199
Corpsman!

01:58:54.201 --> 01:58:55.570
I need a corpsman!

01:58:59.707 --> 01:59:00.742
I got you.

01:59:01.643 --> 01:59:02.644
Here we go.

01:59:11.375 --> 01:59:16.193
You have all fought valiantly.

01:59:17.168 --> 01:59:19.957
But we must scuttle this ship so
that it doesn't fall into enemy hands.

01:59:20.966 --> 01:59:24.663
The loss of this battle falls on the
heads of your commanders, not you.

01:59:25.480 --> 01:59:29.338
For this reason I have decided
to go down with the ship.

01:59:30.342 --> 01:59:36.313
I command you to carry on your
loyal service to the Emperor.

01:59:38.321 --> 01:59:41.563
I wish to stay with you.

01:59:42.723 --> 01:59:43.795
Very well.

01:59:45.864 --> 01:59:47.343
Let us enjoy the moon together.

01:59:49.340 --> 01:59:50.592
Abandon ship.

02:00:05.225 --> 02:00:09.209
Let me stay with you too.

02:00:12.197 --> 02:00:16.188
I am touched by your offer, but
you young men must leave the ship.

02:00:18.043 --> 02:00:19.475
That is my final order.

02:00:43.711 --> 02:00:44.979
What happened to Bruno?

02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:49.014
PBY flew over his last known position.

02:00:49.016 --> 02:00:51.284
They spotted an empty life raft.

02:01:08.326 --> 02:01:13.030
Battle station torpedo port side.

02:01:14.539 --> 02:01:18.387
Target Hiryu bearing ninety degrees.

02:01:44.564 --> 02:01:45.669
Come in.

02:01:50.670 --> 02:01:52.547
Our scouts found nothing.

02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:55.257
The American carriers must
have withdrawn overnight.

02:01:55.677 --> 02:01:59.347
We should bombard Midway. The
Americans have no battleships.

02:01:59.548 --> 02:02:01.683
We can still win this battle.

02:02:03.583 --> 02:02:05.645
You've been playing too much shogi.

02:02:07.897 --> 02:02:13.247
We cannot gamble the rest of
the fleet to save our pride.

02:02:13.993 --> 02:02:14.987
Then...

02:02:15.947 --> 02:02:18.050
what are your orders, sir?

02:03:20.768 --> 02:03:22.036
The Japanese are retreating.

02:03:33.514 --> 02:03:35.016
- We won.
- Yeah.

02:04:14.755 --> 02:04:16.755
God bless those boys.

02:04:16.757 --> 02:04:19.492
Turns out all they needed was a fair fight.

02:05:03.290 --> 02:05:07.414
Look what I found in your house.

02:05:45.046 --> 02:05:46.213
Half our men,

02:05:47.381 --> 02:05:49.216
dead or missing.

02:05:50.251 --> 02:05:51.884
Yeah.

02:05:51.886 --> 02:05:53.621
Hey, whatever happened to that whiskey?

02:05:54.922 --> 02:05:57.189
I was waiting for you
to sneak out of sick bay.

02:06:20.014 --> 02:06:21.182
We did it.

02:07:06.193 --> 02:07:07.194
Hang on, boys.

02:07:12.733 --> 02:07:14.967
- Thanks.
- Of course.

02:07:14.969 --> 02:07:16.301
Hey, Layton.

02:07:16.303 --> 02:07:17.705
Hell of a job.

02:07:21.375 --> 02:07:23.177
You boys really came through for us.

02:07:52.840 --> 02:07:53.841
There's Daddy!

02:07:55.843 --> 02:07:56.844
Come on, baby.

02:08:03.817 --> 02:08:05.319
- Hey!
- Daddy! Daddy!

02:08:06.487 --> 02:08:08.088
Hey, sweetie.

02:08:14.495 --> 02:08:16.096
Oh, thank God.

02:08:17.031 --> 02:08:18.032
What happened?

02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:22.334
Apparently, I inhaled caustic soda.

02:08:22.336 --> 02:08:23.503
What does that mean?

02:08:23.505 --> 02:08:24.903
My lungs are shot.

02:08:24.905 --> 02:08:27.806

02:08:29.443 --> 02:08:32.112

02:08:33.047 --> 02:08:34.114
