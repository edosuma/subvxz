NARRATOR:
Previously on Boston Legal:

00:02.573 --> 00:04.689
Miss Colson,
your firm took this case.

00:04.853 --> 00:07.970
If Edwin Poole lacks capacity to try it,
then it falls to you.

00:08.132 --> 00:10.203
Me? I don't practice criminal law.

00:10.373 --> 00:12.762
And you keep talking
about a system of rules and regulations?

00:12.933 --> 00:14.082
I'm in this for my life here.

00:14.253 --> 00:16.483
I will give you
the very best defense I know how.

00:16.653 --> 00:18.723
I will not allow myself
to be in this for you.

00:18.893 --> 00:20.292
- It's hard, isn't it?
- What is?

00:20.453 --> 00:23.286
To reconcile what we do
and who we are sometimes.

00:23.453 --> 00:24.442
I'm just doing a job.

00:24.613 --> 00:26.046
Sally's given me information...

00:26.213 --> 00:28.169
...which I am ethically required
to attack you with.

00:28.333 --> 00:29.766
- I never said...
- I'm talking.

00:29.933 --> 00:31.161
- Alan...
- I'm talking, Sally.

00:31.333 --> 00:33.130
- May I speak with you?
- I don't wanna speak with you.

00:33.293 --> 00:34.442
If I told you Miles was coming...

00:34.613 --> 00:36.012
I do not want to speak with you.

00:36.173 --> 00:37.288
Can you please walk away?

00:37.453 --> 00:40.365
We either go forward
or go in opposite directions...

00:40.533 --> 00:42.444
...because I don't like
where we are now.

00:42.613 --> 00:45.081
I think I'll just move forward.

00:58.213 --> 01:01.046
Suspects were first observed
at approximately 10:30 p. M...

01:01.213 --> 01:03.204
...across the street
from the station house.

01:03.373 --> 01:04.885
Robin and Catwoman stood guard...

01:05.053 --> 01:07.283
...as Batman soaped
an unoccupied police vehicle.

01:07.453 --> 01:10.490
SUV, Your Honor. An egregious
gas-guzzler. And filthy, by the way.

01:10.653 --> 01:12.006
Continue, officer.

01:12.173 --> 01:14.687
Officer Brody and I approached.
An altercation ensued.

01:14.853 --> 01:16.844
We thought they were hooligans
dressed in costume.

01:17.013 --> 01:18.287
- As the Village People.
- Mm-hmm.

01:18.453 --> 01:20.444
OFFICER: Suspects attempted
to evade apprehension...

01:20.613 --> 01:22.922
...by discharging one or more eggs
in our direction.

01:23.093 --> 01:25.527
Charges are vandalism,
resisting arrest and pandering.

01:25.693 --> 01:28.491
Pandering? Our only tricks
were in conjunction with treating.

01:28.653 --> 01:31.087
- I do not look like a pimp.
- You look like an idiot.

01:31.253 --> 01:33.767
- The cat's a prostitute, Your Honor.
- I object to that.

01:33.933 --> 01:35.844
All right. Masks off now.

01:41.533 --> 01:43.171
I know you.

01:43.493 --> 01:45.643
- Alan Shore.
- Good to see you, judge.

01:46.653 --> 01:49.326
- My colleague, Tara Wilson.
- Hello.

01:50.493 --> 01:52.882
Would you care to explain to me
why two attorneys...

01:53.053 --> 01:57.012
...are out cavorting with a prostitute?
- We needed somebody to be Catwoman.

01:57.173 --> 01:58.162
Someone with a whip.

01:58.573 --> 02:00.882
Mr. Shore,
while you are a gifted attorney...

02:01.053 --> 02:04.011
...you bring embarrassment and shame
to the legal community.

02:04.173 --> 02:05.925
You're very kind, sir.

02:08.013 --> 02:09.889
Case dismissed.

02:48.213 --> 02:50.204
What's this
with the Markham settlement?

02:50.373 --> 02:52.682
He refuses to sign.
Keeps redlining us on language.

02:52.853 --> 02:56.846
We think he's postponing for tax reasons.
I'll keep pushing him as best I can.

02:57.013 --> 03:00.608
On a personal aside, I'd like to remind
everyone to vote. It's our civic duty.

03:00.773 --> 03:04.766
Whatever our politics, we're Americans.
We bleed red, white and blue.

03:07.093 --> 03:09.129
Morgan v. Rayburn.

03:09.293 --> 03:12.046
Still in trial.
Client survived his testimony, barely.

03:12.213 --> 03:15.523
Tara and I are pushing a settlement,
and on a personal aside, I'm bored.

03:15.693 --> 03:18.082
- I beg your pardon?
ALAN: You people keep assigning me...

03:18.253 --> 03:20.767
...these boring cases.
At my old firm, I got murderers.

03:20.933 --> 03:23.288
Clients who touched
themselves in public restrooms.

03:23.453 --> 03:26.604
These were people you could root for,
not to mention, relate to.

03:27.333 --> 03:30.564
Is there some other place
you'd rather be, Mr. Shore?

03:30.733 --> 03:32.086
Yes, I wanna be on cable.

03:32.573 --> 03:34.643
That's where all the best work
is being done.

03:39.373 --> 03:41.841
- Who's doing the Holcomb case?
- That's Edwin Poole.

03:42.533 --> 03:44.842
- Aren't you...?
- I just handled the decert motion.

03:45.013 --> 03:48.483
- I didn't prep the trial.
- Surely, Edwin assigned it to somebody.

03:48.653 --> 03:52.692
Well, um, actually...

03:58.333 --> 03:59.925
Denny?

04:00.453 --> 04:03.126
Are you handling
the Holcomb Pharmaceuticals trial?

04:03.293 --> 04:04.885
I am.

04:05.053 --> 04:07.169
Are you prepared to try this case?

04:08.133 --> 04:10.328
- I will be.
PAUL: You will be?

04:10.493 --> 04:13.132
Are you aware
the trial begins tomorrow?

04:21.012 --> 04:22.128
PAUL:
We have a problem, Lori.

04:22.293 --> 04:25.251
You at least need to backstop
Denny here. I don't...

04:25.413 --> 04:26.402
I can't.

04:26.813 --> 04:30.169
- I'm in trial myself today.
- In trial on what?

04:31.333 --> 04:37.124
I was assigned a case a couple
of days ago, which I sort of took.

04:38.053 --> 04:39.247
What kind of case?

04:39.893 --> 04:42.487
Uh, just a...

04:42.853 --> 04:44.844
...homicide.
- What?

04:45.493 --> 04:49.566
Why are you suddenly
taking court appointments?

04:50.573 --> 04:53.371
I just need kind of a change, that's all.

04:53.853 --> 04:57.004
Now everyone here is dissatisfied?
What is this?

04:57.173 --> 05:00.245
The case I did last week,
it kind of awakened me a little.

05:00.413 --> 05:02.563
I'm feeling the need
to connect with people.

05:02.733 --> 05:05.167
- Criminal people?
- Please don't trivialize this.

05:05.333 --> 05:08.723
Criminal defense is a far cry
from criminal prosecution, Lori.

05:08.893 --> 05:11.327
- You won't like it.
- How can you possibly know that...

05:11.493 --> 05:14.565
...before I even...?
- I know you.

05:19.773 --> 05:21.365
So...

05:23.333 --> 05:24.812
- Shall we?
TARA: We shall.

05:24.973 --> 05:26.292
Do you have Morgan's address?

05:26.453 --> 05:28.205
I do. But what I meant is...

05:28.373 --> 05:30.648
...shall we continue where we left off
last night?

05:30.813 --> 05:34.089
In front of my building
with you peeing in the planter?

05:34.253 --> 05:36.767
I was about to burst.
You should have let me come up.

05:36.933 --> 05:38.366
That plant needed watering.

05:39.133 --> 05:41.169
You should have let me
come up, Tara.

05:41.333 --> 05:44.131
It was 4 a.m. I let you up.
Next thing we know...

05:44.293 --> 05:47.683
...we're in the liquor cabinet.
Two minutes after that, passed out:

05:47.853 --> 05:50.003
Robin sprawled across Batman.

05:50.173 --> 05:52.448
What would they say
at the Hall of Justice?

05:54.173 --> 05:58.007
Was that what you were afraid of?
The sprawling?

05:58.413 --> 06:01.132
I invited you out
to get your mind off Sally.

06:01.293 --> 06:04.649
You've succeeded. It's back to an old,
familiar wanton place.

06:04.813 --> 06:07.850
Alan, we agreed
that you and I couldn't work.

06:08.013 --> 06:10.083
What was the reason again?
I've forgotten.

06:10.253 --> 06:12.972
It would be trouble.
One night out, we lose all control...

06:13.133 --> 06:14.486
...and end up behind bars.

06:14.653 --> 06:17.804
Which was utterly intoxicating,
was it not? Losing control together?

06:17.973 --> 06:21.602
What about it, Tara? After all this time,
maybe we should undress.

06:21.773 --> 06:22.762
We're late.

06:41.413 --> 06:44.086
- Thick file.
- Of course it's a thick file...

06:44.253 --> 06:47.006
...it's a class action
involving thousands of plaintiffs...

06:47.173 --> 06:49.129
...and it's complicated, Denny.

06:49.373 --> 06:50.806
DENNY:
Thick file.

06:50.973 --> 06:54.488
Look, all we can do is throw ourselves
at the mercy of the judge.

06:54.653 --> 06:58.009
If you and I both go to see him
and explain Edwin's situation...

06:58.173 --> 07:01.051
...maybe he'll give us some time.

07:01.213 --> 07:03.169
Thick file.

07:08.133 --> 07:11.921
- Seventy thousand dollars.
- It's their opening offer.

07:12.093 --> 07:13.208
Hmm.

07:13.373 --> 07:16.365
You seem like a very nice man,
Mr. Morgan.

07:16.533 --> 07:18.205
You also seem like a hypochondriac.

07:18.373 --> 07:21.410
- These headaches are real.
- I have no doubt.

07:21.773 --> 07:24.048
You've also complained
on several occasions...

07:24.213 --> 07:26.966
...that you were suffering
from tanapox virus.

07:27.133 --> 07:30.808
Because I noticed
the characteristic papular-lesions.

07:30.973 --> 07:34.363
Very tender.
Approximately 2 centimeters in diameter.

07:34.533 --> 07:38.048
You realize the tanapox virus
is endemic to Equatorial Africa?

07:38.213 --> 07:39.487
Yes.

07:39.653 --> 07:42.372
Have you enjoyed your many visits
to Equatorial Africa?

07:42.533 --> 07:44.046
- I've never been there.
- Ah.

07:44.213 --> 07:48.252
Then perhaps you can see
the outline of our problem, Mr. Morgan.

07:48.413 --> 07:52.884
Look, it's not my fault.
I go to the library and I read books.

07:53.053 --> 07:55.851
And I try to understand
how I might get better.

07:56.013 --> 07:58.368
But sometimes the books,
they scare me even more...

07:58.533 --> 08:02.492
...because they describe diseases
I didn't even know I had.

08:04.493 --> 08:07.053
Maybe I am a hypochondriac.

08:09.053 --> 08:10.691
What do you take for that?

08:16.413 --> 08:18.324
Miss Colson,
I have never been in a fight before.

08:18.493 --> 08:20.484
Okay. We need to be able
to call a witness or two...

08:20.653 --> 08:22.609
...who can speak to your
non-violent character.

08:22.773 --> 08:26.243
- I told you, my mother.
- Mothers tend to come off as biased.

08:26.413 --> 08:27.971
SALLY:
There's gotta be somebody else:

08:28.213 --> 08:31.603
Friends, co-workers.
There's gotta be somebody.

08:31.773 --> 08:34.162
I live at home. I work at home.
I hardly ever go out.

08:34.332 --> 08:36.051
My mother's the only one who...

08:37.972 --> 08:41.443
But I gotta warn you.
She doesn't make the best impression.

08:41.613 --> 08:45.686
- What do you mean?
- Well, she's got a glass eye.

08:46.173 --> 08:49.370
And it doesn't fit so good.
And when she gets upset...

08:51.893 --> 08:55.647
If you put her on the stand,
don't get her upset.

08:57.093 --> 08:59.653
I went up to the bar
to get a few drinks.

08:59.813 --> 09:04.011
And when I turned around, that's when
I saw Jared and him exchanging words.

09:04.173 --> 09:07.165
- And I could tell it wasn't friendly.
- By him...?

09:07.333 --> 09:09.688
The defendant.
So I started heading back...

09:09.853 --> 09:12.572
...and the place was really packed
so I was kind of blocked.

09:12.733 --> 09:16.646
And that's when I saw Jared push him.
And then Jared took a swing and...

09:17.493 --> 09:19.529
...that was it.
- What was it?

09:19.693 --> 09:21.490
Tell us what you saw.

09:21.653 --> 09:24.690
QUINLAN: The defendant, he just
threw a punch right to Jared's throat.

09:24.853 --> 09:26.605
And Jared
just collapsed to the ground.

09:26.773 --> 09:29.571
And when I got there,
he was hardly breathing.

09:29.733 --> 09:32.201
And... He was making
like a sucking noise.

09:32.813 --> 09:35.805
Then he just stopped breathing.
And I tried to do mouth-to-mouth.

09:35.973 --> 09:40.125
And so did another guy
who said he knew CPR, but he...

09:41.373 --> 09:44.683
He just died.
Right there on the floor.

09:44.853 --> 09:47.970
Okay. Now, Mr. Quinlan,
this is important:

09:48.133 --> 09:51.443
Describe the punch as best you can.

09:51.613 --> 09:55.288
It was a... A short direct punch,
and I could... I could tell...

09:55.453 --> 09:57.808
...by the way
he was holding his hand...

09:57.973 --> 10:02.251
...and how he threw the punch,
that he knew martial arts.

10:02.413 --> 10:03.687
It was a kill punch.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.411
- Objection.
- Sustained.

10:05.573 --> 10:08.804
Why, in your lay opinion, sir,
did you regard it as a kill punch?

10:08.973 --> 10:12.568
- Objection.
- Overruled. He can answer.

10:13.133 --> 10:16.250
QUINLAN: By hitting the throat,
you can make it collapse...

10:16.413 --> 10:20.406
...and then the person suffocates.
Which is exactly what happened.

10:21.653 --> 10:22.972
Okay.

10:24.813 --> 10:27.122
You didn't actually see
the altercation begin.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.523
You turned around
and they were having words.

10:29.693 --> 10:31.445
- That's right.
- You couldn't hear what was said?

10:31.613 --> 10:33.410
- No.
- Mr. Quinlan, when the police arrived...

10:33.573 --> 10:36.690
...and questioned you did you tell them
that you recognized my client's punch...

10:36.853 --> 10:39.162
...as a form of martial arts?
- No. I was prob...

10:39.333 --> 10:42.325
Did you demonstrate to them
the fist you just made for the jury?

10:43.413 --> 10:44.562
I was too shook up.

10:44.733 --> 10:47.008
LORl: In fact, you made
no mention of martial arts...

10:47.173 --> 10:49.528
...until after it was published
in the newspapers.

10:49.693 --> 10:53.322
When I read it, it clicked. It made
perfect sense because that's what I saw.

10:53.493 --> 10:54.972
You just forgot to mention it...

10:55.133 --> 10:58.091
...when the police specifically asked you
what you saw?

10:58.813 --> 11:02.601
- How many beers had you had that night?
- Three.

11:02.773 --> 11:05.970
- How many beers had Jared Grant had?
- Three.

11:06.133 --> 11:08.283
So you admittedly
couldn't hear the exchange.

11:08.453 --> 11:11.570
You admittedly didn't see
the altercation begin...

11:11.733 --> 11:13.291
...and you'd been drinking.

11:16.733 --> 11:19.566
Certainly, no one could anticipate
Edwin Poole's illness.

11:19.733 --> 11:21.485
This unanticipated illness
occurred weeks ago.

11:21.653 --> 11:23.371
You come to me the day before the trial?

11:23.533 --> 11:25.808
The simple truth is,
this one fell through the cracks.

11:25.973 --> 11:28.407
The plaintiff has witnesses
from out of town...

11:28.573 --> 11:31.610
- We're willing to assume those costs.
- Gee, what a swell bunch of guys.

11:31.773 --> 11:33.570
PAUL: Your Honor...
BRIAN: No, I'm sick of this.

11:33.733 --> 11:36.725
You have employed a strategy
of systemic heel-dragging. It's immoral.

11:36.893 --> 11:38.008
Edwin Poole is the only...

11:38.173 --> 11:40.733
Whose fault is that?
You should be sued for malpractice.

11:40.893 --> 11:44.488
Brian. You and I have a relationship.
I think of you as a friend.

11:44.653 --> 11:47.850
Yes, well, that friendship's gotta take
a backseat to principle. I'm sorry.

11:48.013 --> 11:50.811
Well, you know, Brian,
given our relationship...

11:50.973 --> 11:56.570
...I feel entitled to be honest, the way
friends are during difficult times.

11:56.733 --> 11:58.325
Can I be honest with you, Brian?

11:58.493 --> 11:59.972
- Please.
- Denny.

12:00.133 --> 12:03.250
You're a bastard, and a greedy one
at that. This is a class action.

12:03.413 --> 12:06.450
You get credit for all
the consolidated cases in one fell swoop.

12:06.613 --> 12:10.083
You're looking to make presiding judge.
You need that credit by year's end.

12:10.253 --> 12:14.007
That's why you're desperate to move
this thing forward. To pad your docket.

12:14.173 --> 12:18.086
This is about ambition, not morality,
you greedy, sniveling, little wop.

12:21.773 --> 12:24.731
- Motion for continuance denied.
DENNY: You know what I'm gonna do?

12:24.893 --> 12:27.612
Just to show you
there are no hard feelings:

12:31.173 --> 12:33.129
I'm gonna sleep with your wife.

12:51.173 --> 12:54.882
It is our recommendation
that you discharge us as counsel.

12:55.053 --> 12:57.613
Ask the judge for time
to find new attorneys.

12:57.773 --> 13:00.446
The only alternative
is proceeding tomorrow...

13:00.613 --> 13:03.411
...which I don't think we want to do.

13:04.093 --> 13:06.561
Edwin Poole never even gave us
this trial date.

13:06.733 --> 13:09.293
He told us
it was continued indefinitely.

13:09.453 --> 13:11.842
Which is why we're suggesting
that you discharge us.

13:12.013 --> 13:15.483
He has got to give you time
to find new counsel.

13:15.653 --> 13:17.609
LORl: You have to handle this, Sally.
- Me?

13:17.773 --> 13:20.128
Look, I have this thing
about glass eyes:

13:20.293 --> 13:23.649
I once had a teacher with a glass eye,
and sometimes when he'd get mad...

13:23.813 --> 13:26.805
...he'd take it out and whack it
on his desk. Gave me nightmares.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.646
- Hi there.
- Hey.

13:29.813 --> 13:31.132
What was that?

13:32.453 --> 13:33.727
Nothing.

13:37.213 --> 13:41.126
Someone just seems a little overeager
to rekindle the flame with Alan Shore.

13:47.253 --> 13:48.891
The offer was firm at 70.

13:49.653 --> 13:52.451
Yes. We thought if you'd unfirm it
to one and a quarter...

13:52.613 --> 13:55.810
...we could be done, your client
wouldn't have to testify tomorrow...

13:55.973 --> 13:59.045
...which, of course, would free him up
to misdiagnose others.

13:59.213 --> 14:03.206
You don't seem to get it, Mr. Shore.
We offered 70 as nuisance change.

14:03.373 --> 14:06.251
Yes. We just feel Mr. Morgan
is a much bigger nuisance...

14:06.413 --> 14:08.005
...than you give him credit for.

14:08.173 --> 14:11.802
And I'm an enormous nuisance.
We should get something for that.

14:23.173 --> 14:26.290
- I feel nauseous.
- You'll be fine.

14:31.493 --> 14:33.051
- Knock on it.
- You knock on it.

14:33.213 --> 14:35.807
- Sally...
- lf I'm doing the talking the least you...

14:35.973 --> 14:37.372
[SCREAMING]

14:37.893 --> 14:39.804
- You his lawyers?
- Hi.

14:39.973 --> 14:41.292
- Hi.
SALLY: I'm Sally Heep.

14:41.453 --> 14:43.523
- This is...
- Lori Colson. Hello.

14:44.053 --> 14:47.682
We just wanted to ask you a few
questions, Mrs. Binder, if we could.

14:47.853 --> 14:49.366
Come on in.

14:51.253 --> 14:54.290
He's a wonderful boy
with a gentle heart.

14:54.453 --> 14:56.125
SALLY:
Yes. Our problem is...

14:56.293 --> 14:59.808
...you seem to be the only person
to truly know him.

14:59.973 --> 15:01.042
[SIGHS]

15:01.213 --> 15:03.852
He thinks I'll make a bad witness
on account of the eye.

15:04.013 --> 15:06.049
It's glass, you see? Look close.

15:09.813 --> 15:11.405
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

15:12.013 --> 15:13.526
Yeah.

15:13.693 --> 15:18.847
The thing is, the prosecution
is obviously claiming...

15:19.013 --> 15:21.288
...that Jason's heart is not gentle.

15:21.453 --> 15:23.967
Has he ever been in trouble?
Has he ever been arrested?

15:24.133 --> 15:26.806
Has he ever caused any problems
for anybody?

15:26.973 --> 15:30.283
No. He is a nice young man
and it's the way I raised him.

15:30.453 --> 15:32.489
That's exactly what we'll need
you to say.

15:32.653 --> 15:35.372
I'm also maybe gonna take you
shopping. Get your hair done.

15:35.533 --> 15:38.730
- The more presentable that you can...
- He deserved to die. Jared Grant.

15:41.093 --> 15:42.446
Why do you say that?

15:42.613 --> 15:45.002
- He beat up my Jason.
- He didn't exactly beat him up.

15:45.173 --> 15:46.288
There was an altercation.

15:46.453 --> 15:49.570
He beat him up. The man is evil
and he deserved to die!

15:49.733 --> 15:51.963
- Let's calm down.
- He deserved it, I tell you!

16:03.533 --> 16:08.288
Dr. Rayburn, over the six months
that Mr. Morgan was in your care...

16:08.453 --> 16:10.887
...how many visits did he make
to your practice?

16:11.053 --> 16:12.884
- Thirty-eight.
- Is that a lot?

16:13.053 --> 16:15.169
Four times as many
as any other patient.

16:15.333 --> 16:17.449
We joked he was the office mascot.

16:17.613 --> 16:21.208
You name the condition,
Mr. Morgan was convinced he had it:

16:21.373 --> 16:26.572
Cold, flu, bronchitis, shingles,
adult-onset diabetes.

16:26.733 --> 16:28.963
I never complained
of adult-onset diabetes.

16:29.133 --> 16:31.124
That's characterized by
excessive thirst.

16:31.293 --> 16:34.490
Does it seem to you
like I've been drinking a lot today?

16:34.653 --> 16:35.927
I'm sure you're fine, Bill.

16:36.093 --> 16:40.883
Mr. Morgan contends,
your neglect drove him to this state.

16:41.053 --> 16:43.692
RAYBURN: The truth is, I bent over
backwards to accommodate him.

16:43.853 --> 16:46.890
He needed to be seen immediately.
And busy as my practice is...

16:47.053 --> 16:49.203
...I always made the time.

16:49.373 --> 16:53.446
I applaud you, sir, for your tireless
commitment to my client. What a guy.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.604
- Objection.
- Sustained.

16:57.373 --> 16:59.682
So these 38 visits, on the house?

17:00.093 --> 17:02.243
- I'm sorry?
- They were free visits?

17:03.413 --> 17:04.686
No.

17:05.693 --> 17:07.251
Oh.

17:07.813 --> 17:09.531
So you charged him?
That makes sense.

17:10.292 --> 17:13.842
So with all his complaining,
his incapacitation...

17:14.012 --> 17:17.323
...that pinched look on his face,
there's nothing wrong with him?

17:17.492 --> 17:19.723
RAYBURN: Nothing clinically, no.
It's in his head.

17:19.893 --> 17:21.929
Traditional home for the migraine,
is it not?

17:22.653 --> 17:26.042
It's psychosomatic.
He's a classic hypochondriac.

17:26.213 --> 17:28.807
I see. Well, there's a diagnosis.

17:29.253 --> 17:31.289
Tell me, what treatment
did you prescribe...

17:31.453 --> 17:33.967
...for my client's classic hypochondria?

17:34.133 --> 17:36.283
I'm a general practitioner,
not a psychiatrist.

17:36.453 --> 17:39.365
So you referred him out to whom?

17:39.813 --> 17:42.771
No one in particular, l...
I did tell him he needed help.

17:42.933 --> 17:46.164
I believe I even gave him
a list of practitioners.

17:46.333 --> 17:48.847
So he kept coming to you,
you kept taking his money...

17:49.013 --> 17:52.483
...you did not treat him,
and you referred him to...

17:53.893 --> 17:56.805
...no one in particular.
- I'm a GP.

17:56.973 --> 17:59.282
I told him to seek mental treatment.

17:59.653 --> 18:02.645
I advised it. I can't force it.

18:02.813 --> 18:05.964
Once again: He kept coming,
you kept taking the money...

18:06.133 --> 18:09.125
...and you referred him
to no one in particular.

18:23.173 --> 18:24.845
So you now wanna fire your lawyers?

18:25.013 --> 18:27.607
Yes, Your Honor.
We had no idea trial was about to start.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.570
That's how incompetent
these people are.

18:29.733 --> 18:33.282
And I suppose you had no idea that your
company was bilking senior citizens?

18:33.453 --> 18:36.843
Certainly, Your Honor intends to
keep an open mind with regard to the...

18:37.013 --> 18:40.164
Here's the deal:
I give you one day to find new counsel.

18:40.333 --> 18:45.327
Twenty-four hours. After that, I'm fining
you $250,000 a day for further delay.

18:49.013 --> 18:50.446
It almost seemed personal.

18:50.613 --> 18:52.444
Have you done anything
to upset this guy?

18:52.613 --> 18:53.887
Not that I can think of.

18:54.053 --> 18:57.170
Look, aside from preparation concerns,
we got a bigger problem.

18:57.333 --> 19:00.803
- This judge, he's biased.
- This is what I propose we do:

19:00.973 --> 19:03.726
- File an interlocutory appeal, asking...
- At 250,000 a day...?

19:03.893 --> 19:06.327
While we're filing that appeal,
we'll go forward.

19:06.493 --> 19:08.370
Should we win,
we can suspend the trial.

19:08.533 --> 19:10.330
Should we lose,
we won't incur the fine.

19:10.493 --> 19:13.007
But are you people ready
to try this case?

19:13.173 --> 19:14.845
I can try it.

19:15.973 --> 19:17.645
Denny Crane.

19:18.533 --> 19:21.445
There were some settlement discussions
that broke down.

19:21.613 --> 19:24.764
If Denny can open big, that might
bring them back to the table...

19:24.933 --> 19:28.005
...which may be the best way to go
at this point.

19:29.213 --> 19:31.443
It was four years ago
at a park in Brighton.

19:31.613 --> 19:34.286
- You met the defendant?
- Well, I didn't exactly meet him.

19:34.453 --> 19:37.365
- Well, what then?
- I beat the crap out of him.

19:38.693 --> 19:41.253
Excuse me.
I was a different person then.

19:41.413 --> 19:44.849
Okay, Mr. Stone, we need to be very
specific about what happened back then.

19:45.013 --> 19:47.049
STONE: He tried to get into a game
of pick-up hoops.

19:47.213 --> 19:49.204
Me and another guy,
we started dissing him.

19:49.373 --> 19:53.127
He said something back, and we beat
him up pretty good. I'm not proud of it.

19:53.293 --> 19:55.249
And you're sure it was Jason Binder?

19:55.853 --> 19:59.368
Yeah. When I saw his picture
on the news, I remembered his face.

19:59.533 --> 20:01.046
It was definitely him.

20:01.213 --> 20:03.283
And what about the other guy
who beat him up?

20:03.773 --> 20:06.412
Jared Grant, the guy he killed.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.966
You lied to me.
Not only were you in a fight before...

20:14.133 --> 20:17.205
- It doesn't prove anything.
- Now they have a motive, Jason:

20:17.373 --> 20:20.251
The victim beats you up four years ago,
you take tae kwon do...

20:20.413 --> 20:23.450
...you just happen to encounter him,
at which point, you kill him?

20:23.613 --> 20:26.002
- It wasn't like that.
- That's why your mom said...

20:26.173 --> 20:29.131
...he deserved to die, because...
- It wasn't like that!

20:31.933 --> 20:34.049
What am I supposed to argue now?

20:34.213 --> 20:37.205
Let's have it, Jason.
Did you go to that bar to get revenge?

20:37.373 --> 20:39.125
I went there to stand up to him.

20:39.533 --> 20:43.651
You have no idea
how haunted I was by...

20:45.053 --> 20:47.328
I didn't even put up my hands
four years ago.

20:47.493 --> 20:49.529
It wasn't getting beat up
that stuck with me.

20:49.693 --> 20:51.570
It was that I didn't even...

20:54.413 --> 20:57.962
I just let myself get beat up.

20:58.133 --> 21:02.285
- So you took up martial arts.
- And I went there to stand up to him.

21:02.453 --> 21:07.402
I didn't plan to fight.
I certainly didn't go there to kill him.

21:08.813 --> 21:11.407
And then when he swung at me,
I just...

21:12.853 --> 21:14.730
I swung back.

21:18.333 --> 21:20.767
I never meant to kill him.

21:39.613 --> 21:41.331
Who are we over-billing?

21:41.493 --> 21:45.691
- Medicare or senior citizens?
- Both. But Medicare isn't suing us.

21:45.853 --> 21:48.242
- Us? Meaning the drug company?
- Correct.

21:48.413 --> 21:51.211
But if the hospitals
are doing the overcharging...

21:51.373 --> 21:53.443
...why are the seniors
suing the drug company?

21:53.613 --> 21:55.251
Denny, we've been over this before:

21:55.413 --> 21:58.132
The drug company,
our client, deals with hospitals.

21:58.293 --> 22:01.046
We give them rebates, they disguise
the real cost of drugs.

22:01.213 --> 22:04.489
They then bill Medicare for the
higher, allegedly inflated costs.

22:04.653 --> 22:07.247
Really? What's our defense to that?

22:13.013 --> 22:15.811
Seventy-five. You've upped
your offer by 5000 dollars.

22:15.973 --> 22:17.611
We feel it's generous.

22:17.773 --> 22:20.685
Particularly when your
client's injuries aren't real.

22:20.853 --> 22:22.445
- They're real.
ALAN: All right, Bill.

22:22.613 --> 22:25.923
You know, Mr. Morgan, I don't
typically counsel opposing parties.

22:26.093 --> 22:28.926
But I might advise
a legal malpractice claim...

22:29.093 --> 22:33.484
...against the attorney who filled
your head with million-dollar windfalls.

22:33.653 --> 22:38.647
You seem to have a little something
wedged between numbers four and five.

22:41.933 --> 22:43.207
Hmm.

22:43.373 --> 22:44.965
Guess it's just part of your mouth.

22:45.813 --> 22:49.601
One last proposal, and it's entirely
possible I'm kidding, by the way...

22:49.773 --> 22:51.286
...depending upon your reaction.

22:51.453 --> 22:56.766
Three hundred thousand, sealed,
we kick back 50 to you under the table.

22:57.973 --> 23:01.363
Mr. Shore, I guarantee you,
I am not that kind of attorney.

23:01.533 --> 23:04.001
Really? Gosh, I am.

23:04.173 --> 23:07.370
I should report you directly to the bar,
if not the district attorney.

23:07.533 --> 23:10.570
Well, if that's how you feel,
then I was kidding.

23:13.933 --> 23:15.651
I'm going to the judge now.

23:15.813 --> 23:20.603
Excellent. New trial. That'll certainly
cost your client much more than 75,000.

23:23.173 --> 23:25.323
Your offer is rejected.

23:30.573 --> 23:32.484
Suppose he does go to the judge?

23:32.653 --> 23:36.487
ALAN: Oh, please. He doesn't
want a mistrial. He thinks he's won.

23:36.653 --> 23:40.123
Plus, he can't prove I wasn't kidding.
I'm known to be funny.

23:41.573 --> 23:44.167
This is a child who wouldn't
slap a mosquito.

23:44.333 --> 23:45.607
He would shoo it away.

23:45.773 --> 23:50.483
He couldn't bring himself to harm a fly or
any animal, certainly not a human being.

23:50.653 --> 23:53.486
Four years harboring a grudge
doesn't suggest a rage to you?

23:53.653 --> 23:55.928
He was bullied by
many people, Mr. Martin.

23:56.093 --> 23:58.561
- Not just Jared Grant.
- But he killed Jared Grant.

23:58.733 --> 24:01.531
MRS. BINDER: He got into a fight
which had a tragic ending.

24:01.693 --> 24:03.763
He never intended to kill,
nor could he.

24:03.933 --> 24:07.369
- Well, he learns a lethal martial arts...
- He learned to defend himself.

24:08.173 --> 24:10.050
Look at the size of him,
for God's sake.

24:10.533 --> 24:13.331
What was he to do?
Fend people off with a sharp wit?

24:14.333 --> 24:16.847
Mrs. Binder, you love your son
very much, don't you?

24:17.013 --> 24:20.164
- Of course I do.
- In fact, he's your only child.

24:20.333 --> 24:22.085
He's all you have, isn't he?

24:23.333 --> 24:24.812
- Yes.
- He lives with you.

24:24.973 --> 24:28.761
- Or, did before his arrest.
- There's something wrong with that?

24:28.933 --> 24:32.721
I bet you would do or say anything
to keep him from going to prison.

24:33.373 --> 24:35.568
I'm up here telling the truth.

24:35.733 --> 24:38.531
MARTIN: No, you're telling lies
to spare a loved one a life sentence.

24:38.693 --> 24:40.809
- No, you're the liar.
- Your son's a killer!

24:40.973 --> 24:43.726
- No, he is not!
- Your son is a killer!

24:43.893 --> 24:45.212
No, he is not!

[GLASS EYE TAPPING]

25:01.013 --> 25:03.402
DENNY: What does a rubber glove
have to do with it?

25:03.573 --> 25:06.133
Denny, the alleged fraud goes
beyond prescription drugs.

25:06.293 --> 25:08.727
- It goes to medical supplies.
- I see a rubber glove...

25:08.893 --> 25:10.485
...I'm heading the other direction.

25:10.653 --> 25:13.326
Denny, do you understand
what this case is about?

25:13.493 --> 25:14.642
I do, Paul.

25:15.173 --> 25:17.084
Can you succinctly tell us?

25:21.973 --> 25:24.885
The plaintiff thinks he's getting
bilked for drugs and supplies.

25:25.053 --> 25:27.613
His evidence is: We charge
hospitals and clinics less...

25:27.773 --> 25:30.765
...for those drugs and supplies.
Our argument is: The offering...

25:30.933 --> 25:35.085
...of a discount to a consumer does
not constitute the over-billing to another.

25:35.253 --> 25:38.529
In fact, since hospitals
and clinics with ER's...

25:38.693 --> 25:40.729
...regularly treat
those who cannot pay...

25:40.893 --> 25:44.169
...an argument could be made that we're
extending these discounts...

25:44.333 --> 25:47.530
...to those most in need.
We're saving lives, damn it.

25:48.293 --> 25:52.206
And I will not apologize
for my client's billing practices.

25:52.373 --> 25:55.331
I salute them.
I invite you to salute them.

25:59.333 --> 26:01.528
Okay. Let's turn
to the vertical integration...

26:01.693 --> 26:03.604
...between our clients and the hospitals.

26:04.093 --> 26:05.412
What the hell is that?

26:19.933 --> 26:21.730
LORl: Earl Grey, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

26:22.053 --> 26:25.807
- That would keep me up until Thursday.
- Hopefully a few hours, at least.

26:25.973 --> 26:29.682
- You and Alan pulling a late one?
- Might be. We're closing tomorrow.

26:30.293 --> 26:31.612
What are you doing tonight?

26:33.013 --> 26:34.412
Preparing.

26:35.013 --> 26:36.287
Right.

26:37.773 --> 26:40.765
You know, the whole Sally
and Alan thing, she's still pretty raw.

26:40.933 --> 26:43.766
- Meaning?
- Just that if you had any intentions of...

26:43.933 --> 26:47.403
Eating her? Raw would
certainly be problematic.

26:48.133 --> 26:51.125
All that kicking and screaming.
Rare often works for me.

26:51.293 --> 26:53.204
Seared.

26:55.293 --> 26:57.170
I'm sorry.
Did you mean something else?

26:57.333 --> 27:00.131
- I'm just looking out for a friend.
- I see.

27:00.293 --> 27:04.650
Well, given that it was Sally's decision
to end our relationship...

27:04.813 --> 27:08.089
...perhaps you'd consider
looking out for me.

27:09.173 --> 27:10.845
You seem all right.

27:11.453 --> 27:13.728
Just to clarify,
if Tara did have any intention...

27:13.893 --> 27:16.885
...of whatever euphemism
you were in search of...

27:17.053 --> 27:19.726
...it would, in fact,
be none of your business.

27:19.893 --> 27:23.852
To put your mind at rest,
Tara appears not to have intentions.

27:24.013 --> 27:26.447
I do. In fact, just yesterday...

27:26.613 --> 27:30.003
...I was suggesting to her that
we engage in a sexual act in her office...

27:30.173 --> 27:32.687
...but her impenetrable sense
of decorum...

27:32.853 --> 27:36.846
...unfortunately prevented us
from engaging.

27:47.053 --> 27:48.452
That was unnecessary.

27:56.093 --> 27:57.811
ATTORNEY:
It's a scam.

27:57.973 --> 28:00.726
They charge the hospital
X amount of dollars for the drug.

28:00.893 --> 28:04.727
The hospital then bills Medicare a portion
of which the senior citizens are paying.

28:04.893 --> 28:08.442
The evidence will show that the
defendant, Holcomb Pharmaceuticals...

28:08.613 --> 28:10.729
...systematically defrauded and bilked...

28:10.893 --> 28:14.727
...senior citizens out of
billions and billions of dollars.

28:14.893 --> 28:18.852
The elderly are discriminated against
every single day in this country:

28:19.013 --> 28:20.844
They get their driver's licenses yanked.

28:21.013 --> 28:23.527
They are targeted
by abusive telemarketers.

28:23.693 --> 28:25.809
The prejudice is pervasive.

28:25.973 --> 28:30.171
But you know what?
They still do get one thing:

28:30.653 --> 28:32.484
Their day in court.

28:48.333 --> 28:51.848
Need I point out
that it's your turn to talk?

29:06.373 --> 29:08.762
Hate old people. Always have.
They're babies.

29:09.693 --> 29:12.332
Hell, there's a reason
half of them are in diapers.

29:20.893 --> 29:23.407
The elderly...

29:24.253 --> 29:28.565
...make up a large percentage
of the wealth in this country.

29:29.133 --> 29:31.931
They run most
of the Fortune 500 companies.

29:32.093 --> 29:33.890
They're running
the war for God's sakes.

29:34.053 --> 29:36.521
And most of them
are viable, healthy people.

29:36.693 --> 29:41.369
What do they do? Retire at age 65
and start draining our resources.

29:41.533 --> 29:43.330
We got enormous poverty
in this country.

29:43.493 --> 29:46.565
We can't educate our kids,
partly because these strong-bodied...

29:46.733 --> 29:51.648
...strong-minded senior-citizen farts
are living off of Social Security.

29:51.813 --> 29:53.724
Why shouldn't we overcharge them?

29:53.893 --> 29:55.929
Mr. Crane,
I'm not following your argument.

29:56.093 --> 29:57.924
That's because you're a moron.

29:58.493 --> 30:00.961
- Judges, old people, they all gotta go.
- Mr. Crane...

30:01.133 --> 30:04.728
Tell you what. Slap my client
with a million-dollar verdict.

30:04.893 --> 30:06.645
We'll pass on the cost
to the consumer.

30:06.813 --> 30:09.805
The plaintiffs will think they've won.
We won't be out a dime.

30:09.973 --> 30:14.091
Members of the jury, regretfully,
I must declare this proceeding a mistrial.

30:14.253 --> 30:17.529
Oh, gee, I'm sorry to hear that.
That'll cause a big delay, won't it?

30:17.693 --> 30:19.684
Next thing you know,
he'll recuse himself...

30:19.853 --> 30:23.528
...because I called him a bad word.
- You are in contempt! Bailiff...

30:24.293 --> 30:27.729
...take Mr. Crane into custody.
- Put me in a cell with Martha, will you?

30:29.373 --> 30:31.523
I gotta have sex with that woman.

30:43.773 --> 30:46.970
Four years of premeditation.
He trained in deadly force.

30:47.133 --> 30:49.442
Then he sought out Jared Grant,
provoked a fight...

30:49.613 --> 30:52.286
...and inflicted a deadly blow
to his trachea.

30:52.453 --> 30:55.013
LORl:
Maybe he even did start the fight.

30:55.173 --> 30:57.812
We can't know that.
There's no proof of that.

30:57.973 --> 30:59.531
But even if we're to assume it...

30:59.693 --> 31:02.082
...we simply cannot make the leap
to intent to kill.

31:02.253 --> 31:03.527
Why else would he go there?

31:03.693 --> 31:05.809
Why else would he punch him
in the throat?

31:05.973 --> 31:08.692
Why would he do it
in front of a room full of people?

31:08.853 --> 31:11.925
Why not just run him down with a car,
if his intent was to kill?

31:12.093 --> 31:16.689
Jason Binder went there, as he told you,
to stand up for himself.

31:16.853 --> 31:18.844
Nothing more.

31:19.533 --> 31:24.084
It's bad enough that patients
are running to the courts...

31:24.253 --> 31:27.928
...suing their doctors for all their ills.

31:28.653 --> 31:33.169
Now we have one suing
for his imagined ills.

31:33.333 --> 31:38.043
This case represents the height
in frivolous litigation.

31:38.213 --> 31:41.683
What's next?
Seeking damages for a bad dream?

31:42.493 --> 31:43.926
I hope not.

31:59.493 --> 32:01.723
Frivolous, is that what he said?
Frivolous?

32:03.293 --> 32:07.809
Astonishing. This man,
who suffers day in and day out...

32:07.973 --> 32:11.807
...migraines so excruciating
he cannot work...

32:11.973 --> 32:16.410
...can't endure 10 minutes at his
computer, a trained software-engineer.

32:16.573 --> 32:20.725
And here he is subjecting himself
to depositions, to examinations...

32:20.893 --> 32:24.886
...to the laborious mind-numbing
blather of attorneys, all for what?

32:25.053 --> 32:26.122
Frivolity?

32:27.453 --> 32:31.002
For six months, Bill Morgan
reached out to his doctor.

32:31.173 --> 32:32.447
Week after week.

32:32.613 --> 32:37.004
Each time, invoiced for thousands
and thousands of dollars in sum.

32:37.813 --> 32:43.092
And then, each time, dismissed.
Patted on the head, and sent on his way.

32:43.253 --> 32:47.883
Had Mr. Morgan actually received
the right medical care...

32:48.053 --> 32:50.044
...or even been directed to a doctor...

32:50.213 --> 32:52.443
...who could specifically give him
that care...

32:52.613 --> 32:54.524
...psychiatric or otherwise...

32:54.693 --> 32:57.571
...his current state would most likely
have been alleviated.

32:57.733 --> 33:00.201
But the defendant couldn't
be bothered to care.

33:00.853 --> 33:05.210
As Dr. Rayburn told you himself,
he treated Bill Morgan like a mascot.

33:05.373 --> 33:07.728
Opposing counsel
regards him as a nuisance.

33:09.093 --> 33:11.527
He's a human being.

33:13.453 --> 33:15.603
He's a human being.

33:16.533 --> 33:18.046
We teach our children...

33:18.213 --> 33:24.083
...that everyone is entitled
to respect and dignity.

33:24.893 --> 33:28.602
How pathetic it is,
when adults can't abide...

33:28.773 --> 33:32.607
...such a basic lesson in humanity.

33:38.173 --> 33:40.164
How unconscionable.

33:54.893 --> 33:56.724
The defendant will please rise.

34:00.813 --> 34:03.805
Madam Foreperson, the jury has
reached a unanimous verdict?

34:03.973 --> 34:06.851
- We have, Your Honor.
- What say you?

34:07.013 --> 34:09.732
In the case of
the Commonwealth v. Jason Binder...

34:09.893 --> 34:12.123
...on the charge of murder
in the first degree...

34:12.293 --> 34:15.330
...we find the defendant,
Jason Binder, not guilty.

34:15.493 --> 34:17.688
On the charge of murder
in the second degree...

34:17.853 --> 34:21.447
...we find the defendant,
Jason Binder, not guilty.

34:22.013 --> 34:25.130
JUDGE: The jury is dismissed, with our
thanks. The defendant is free to go.

34:25.293 --> 34:26.772
We are adjourned.

34:26.973 --> 34:30.487
Thank you, so much. Thank you.

35:20.933 --> 35:24.289
I'm told congratulations are in order.

35:25.893 --> 35:27.690
You too.

35:28.293 --> 35:30.204
Denny bought you some time, I hear.

35:47.533 --> 35:50.923
My father was
a criminal-defense attorney.

35:51.813 --> 35:54.532
He went into it
to champion civil rights...

35:54.693 --> 35:57.685
...to defend the oppressed...

35:57.853 --> 35:59.047
...to...

36:00.613 --> 36:02.729
...connect with people.

36:04.013 --> 36:05.844
But all I ever saw
at the supper table...

36:06.013 --> 36:08.971
...was a man struggling to deal
with the idea...

36:09.733 --> 36:13.123
...that he helped put murderers
back on the street.

36:28.733 --> 36:30.928
- Heading home?
- Jail.

36:31.093 --> 36:32.970
Incarcerated friend.

36:33.133 --> 36:36.205
- You run with a dangerous crowd.
- I try.

36:36.413 --> 36:39.564
- As do I.
- I don't think that's quite true.

36:39.733 --> 36:42.691
You don't know me, Alan Shore,
not as well as you think.

36:42.853 --> 36:46.004
- No?
- No, certainly not as well as I know you.

36:46.173 --> 36:47.606
How well is that?

36:48.373 --> 36:50.489
I know that
there are three Alan Shores:

36:51.093 --> 36:54.927
The good, the bad and the naughty.

36:55.093 --> 36:59.883
The good Alan, the man that I saw today
in court, is honorable and decent.

37:00.373 --> 37:03.092
But you can't bear the burden
of being that man.

37:03.253 --> 37:04.732
Thus, the bad Alan.

37:04.893 --> 37:08.249
Who lays to waste everything
in his life that seems right.

37:09.413 --> 37:11.643
I do have intentions.

37:12.333 --> 37:14.528
My intentions are
to get beyond the bad...

37:14.693 --> 37:17.366
...which I have tried to do,
again and again...

37:17.533 --> 37:18.932
...by appealing to the good.

37:19.093 --> 37:21.402
But it appears to me that perhaps...

37:23.253 --> 37:26.290
...I should be appealing
to the naughty.

37:27.133 --> 37:31.206
I'm not certain the Tara Wilson I know
is up to the task.

37:31.373 --> 37:33.648
Again, you don't know me, Alan.

37:37.293 --> 37:38.965
File for you.

38:14.733 --> 38:17.201
Your bail was set at six million dollars.

Funny.

I brought you a hamburger.

The guards here
are extremely outspoken.

38:29.293 --> 38:32.126
Lori got a not guilty
in her murder case.

38:33.293 --> 38:37.081
You cleverly orchestrated a mistrial.

38:37.253 --> 38:39.847
And a woman I'm infatuated with...

38:40.013 --> 38:44.484
...delivered to me her panties
in a manila folder.

38:45.093 --> 38:49.450
I think we're obliged to have a drink.

38:51.613 --> 38:53.410
Cheers.

I wasn't clever.

38:57.253 --> 38:59.084
I forgot.

39:00.253 --> 39:02.084
I beg your pardon?

39:04.653 --> 39:06.086
I stood up...

39:06.773 --> 39:11.722
...armed with all the facts
of our client's billing practices...

39:11.893 --> 39:13.406
...and...

39:14.253 --> 39:17.006
...I went blank in front of the jury.

39:18.973 --> 39:21.282

Well...

...there's no exact diagnostic...

...you may have gone up
on an opening...

...but to recover like that
and go for the mistrial...

40:12.373 --> 40:17.686
...that's evidence of a man
thinking quickly on his feet.
