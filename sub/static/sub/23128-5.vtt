WEBVTT

00:01.100 --> 00:03.023
- Previously...

00:03.130 --> 00:04.768
- You want me
to screen my patients

00:04.800 --> 00:07.064
for the virus and then
hand them over to you.

00:07.100 --> 00:08.329
- We take a pint or two.

00:08.370 --> 00:09.804
- Because that
worked so well

00:09.840 --> 00:11.808
with the girls upstairs
who ended up dead.

00:11.840 --> 00:14.502
(Women screaming,
bones cracking)

00:14.540 --> 00:15.905
- Who's that?

00:15.940 --> 00:18.079
- (Nurse): That's Kenny.
Poor kid.

00:18.110 --> 00:22.149
He's never been sick, but he's
never been out of that room.

00:22.190 --> 00:24.648
- And this crazy-ass dog
scratched the hell out of me.

00:24.690 --> 00:27.011
- She should stay with us
through her first turn.

00:27.060 --> 00:28.414
- I'm a reanimated corpse

00:28.460 --> 00:30.428
brought back from
the dead by a spell.

00:30.460 --> 00:32.689
- Money we can do.
You start tomorrow.

00:32.729 --> 00:33.959
- (Josh): She's only 15!

00:34.000 --> 00:36.469
What the hell
is wrong with you?

00:36.500 --> 00:38.992
Erin?
She'll come back.

00:39.030 --> 00:42.136
- I'm Liam McLean,
Connor and Brynn's father.

00:42.170 --> 00:44.138
- I killed his daughter!

00:48.180 --> 00:51.047
(Car passing nearby)

00:53.150 --> 00:55.175
(Siren wailing)

01:07.260 --> 01:10.093
- No. That won't do.

01:10.130 --> 01:13.395
Your kind doesn't get
any real nourishment from a rat.

01:16.170 --> 01:18.264
- Where you going,
leech? Hmm?

01:21.640 --> 01:22.801
- You got a name?

01:22.850 --> 01:25.103
- Carlos.
Carlos Boyd.

01:25.150 --> 01:27.949
- Well, Mr. Boyd,
this is sad.

01:27.980 --> 01:30.449
Of all the things you could've
had for a last meal,

01:30.490 --> 01:31.810
you chose a rat.

01:31.850 --> 01:33.750
(Carlos cries, screams)

01:36.590 --> 01:39.525
- This is getting easy.
There's no sport in it anymore.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.722
- It was never
about the sport.

01:55.440 --> 01:58.478
= What?
- Nothing. You look great.

01:58.510 --> 02:00.945
- Josh, stop adding up
maple syrup in your head.

02:00.980 --> 02:02.345
- I'm not.
- I have a job.

02:02.390 --> 02:04.142
=T know. _
- I'm kicking in for groceries.

02:04.190 --> 02:06.750
- How's the job going?
- It's a funeral home, so...

02:06.790 --> 02:08.348
Mourners aren't
that messy,

02:08.389 --> 02:12.054
so the place is easy
to keep clean and... Ah...

02:12.090 --> 02:14.752
Max is a good boss, so...
- Is he cute?

02:14.800 --> 02:16.052
(Giggling)

02:16.100 --> 02:18.319
- So ask him out!

02:18.370 --> 02:21.396
This is your 2nd chance, right?
You gotta take advantage!

02:21.440 --> 02:24.137
- And maybe do it before those
waffles stick to your hips.

02:24.170 --> 02:26.832
- So mean! You're a pig!
- (Laughing): Sorry.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.200
(Door opens and closes)

02:28.240 --> 02:29.878
Hey, Angel-face!

02:29.910 --> 02:33.141
We're watching Sally shove
waffles down her gullet.

02:33.180 --> 02:34.944
You wanna join us?
- No, I'll pass.

02:34.980 --> 02:37.039
Overnight shift is
just killing me.

02:37.090 --> 02:38.615
- You're a creature
of the night!

02:38.650 --> 02:40.516
This shift should be
right up your alley.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.119
- I'm just adjusting.
I'm tired.

02:42.160 --> 02:43.457
<i>- And hungry
Aght?</i>

02:46.090 --> 02:47.592
- Yep. Still hungry.

02:47.630 --> 02:48.927
- How's that going?

02:50.600 --> 02:53.535
- I'm going to bed.

02:53.570 --> 02:56.505
- What, are we not supposed
to talk about that?

03:06.010 --> 03:07.944
- What do we have here?

03:07.980 --> 03:10.620
- Mr. Waite came in complaining
of headaches and nausea.

03:10.650 --> 03:13.517
Further tests revealed
fatigue and mood swings.

03:13.560 --> 03:15.050
It's all in the chart.

03:16.020 --> 03:17.419
- (Weakly):
I--I know you.

03:17.460 --> 03:19.827
- This man is clearly suffering
from malnourishment.

03:19.860 --> 03:21.328
He needs to
eat something.

03:21.360 --> 03:22.668
- He has a specific diet.

03:22.700 --> 03:24.168
He needs blood.

03:24.200 --> 03:25.895
- And most blood
is dirty now,

03:25.930 --> 03:27.034
because of that bug.

03:27.070 --> 03:28.629
- That's an easy fix.

03:28.670 --> 03:31.332
My blood is clean
as a whistle.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.149
Go ahead.

03:38.180 --> 03:39.511
(Grunting)

03:39.550 --> 03:41.314
- You don't know
what you're doing.

03:41.350 --> 03:42.647
- (Nurse): It's OK, Aidan.

03:42.690 --> 03:44.249
You need it.

03:44.290 --> 03:45.917
- It's survival.

03:54.830 --> 03:56.093
OK, that's enough.

03:56.130 --> 03:58.019
Ah, ah, ah!

03:59.800 --> 04:02.360
Listen, buddy!
Stop. Stop!

04:03.540 --> 04:04.769
Stop!

04:09.350 --> 04:10.749
(Sighs)

04:18.589 --> 04:20.718
- Hey, handsome.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.250
- Did you miss us?

04:34.240 --> 04:37.130
- How does a 15-year-old girl
with limited funds just vanish?

04:37.170 --> 04:39.138
- Maybe Erin doesn't
wanna be found.

04:39.170 --> 04:41.275
I know it was sudden,
the way she left,

04:41.310 --> 04:43.950
but we told her
what she was,

04:43.980 --> 04:46.472
we taught her how to
cope with the change.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.443
- And then we chased her away.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.539
- We didn't adopt her. Did we?

04:50.590 --> 04:52.649
- You weren't with
her when she changed.

04:52.690 --> 04:55.182
Maybe it's best that she's
not in the house right now,

04:55.220 --> 04:58.349
with Aidan the way that he is.

04:58.390 --> 05:01.223
I'm sorry, but I feel like
I'm splitting the cable bill

05:01.260 --> 05:03.024
with a ticking time bomb.

05:08.900 --> 05:11.870
- (Sally): Is this
the right cloth-- Aaah!

05:11.910 --> 05:13.309
What is that?
What is that?

05:13.340 --> 05:14.739
(Sally moaning)

05:14.780 --> 05:17.044
You know, we hear all about
what time and gravity

05:17.080 --> 05:19.970
does to a woman's breasts,
but nobody shines a light

05:20.020 --> 05:22.079
on what it does to
a man's yam bag.

05:22.120 --> 05:23.884
That's a silent suffering.

05:23.920 --> 05:25.445
- (Laughing):
That's profound.

05:26.720 --> 05:29.428
Oh, are you, like,
giving a massage to a dead man?

05:29.460 --> 05:31.087
- It helps with
the rigor mortis.

05:31.130 --> 05:34.350
It's a shame he can't feel this,
I'm pretty good at massage.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.526
- Oh, is that so?

05:35.560 --> 05:37.494
- No you're not.

05:37.530 --> 05:40.033
I used to get light
Swedish once a month.

05:40.070 --> 05:41.538
Your form is
terrible, buddy.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.435
Hey...

05:44.470 --> 05:47.235
You can see me, can't you?

05:47.280 --> 05:48.975
- Oh, oh, man.
I am so sorry.

05:49.010 --> 05:51.707
Here I am showing you old balls
and talking about massage,

05:51.750 --> 05:54.674
I mean, this is work-place
harassment. I'm a harasser!

05:54.720 --> 05:56.142
- Listen, I need help.

05:56.180 --> 05:58.581
- Uh, I think I'm gonna
go back to work.

05:58.620 --> 05:59.883
- OK.

05:59.920 --> 06:01.911
- Hey, hey, wait! Wait!

06:09.000 --> 06:10.490
Thank God I found you.

06:11.730 --> 06:13.459
- Look, mister,
you have to go.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.059
I'm already
in a weird situation,

06:15.100 --> 06:17.000
and I can't be
chatting it up with you.

06:17.040 --> 06:19.031
Please understand.
- You have to help me!

06:19.070 --> 06:22.074
My no-good sons are
fighting over my will,

06:22.110 --> 06:25.102
but I wrote
a 2nd will and...

06:25.150 --> 06:26.811
What's with
the tire iron?

06:26.850 --> 06:28.249
- It's for moments
like these.

06:28.280 --> 06:30.419
I'm sorry. This isn't
the Ghost Whisperer.

06:38.790 --> 06:40.451
- Y-you're not real.
You're not real.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.798
You must just be
on my mind.

06:42.830 --> 06:45.822
With Henry dead, it makes sense
that I would think of you and...

06:45.870 --> 06:49.659
Sally and Nora, they would have
seen you if you were ghosts.

06:49.710 --> 06:52.338
- No, we've been away,

06:52.370 --> 06:53.838
trying to resolve
some stuff,

06:53.880 --> 06:55.370
find our doors.

06:55.410 --> 06:59.711
- Beth had daddy issues and
I had a major self-esteem thing.

06:59.750 --> 07:03.812
- But then we heard
you were back and...

07:03.850 --> 07:05.409
- Priorities change, right?

07:05.450 --> 07:08.659
- Yeah, well, I can get rid
of you. I can exorcise you.

07:08.690 --> 07:09.919
(Laughing)

07:09.960 --> 07:11.655
- (Scoffing):
Kill us twice? No.

07:11.690 --> 07:14.489
You wanna torture yourself for
all the harm you've done.

07:14.530 --> 07:16.669
And we're here to
help you with that.

07:16.700 --> 07:18.668
Every minute...

07:18.700 --> 07:20.168
...of every day.

07:20.200 --> 07:22.635
- (Both): Even in your dreams.

07:22.670 --> 07:23.967
(Knocking at door)

07:31.510 --> 07:33.148
- Hi!

07:33.180 --> 07:35.217
Can I help you?

07:35.250 --> 07:37.912
- (Woman): Is Nora home?
- No.

07:37.950 --> 07:40.658
- OK. Um, can you tell her
Kat stopped by?

07:40.690 --> 07:42.988
I'm a friend of hers.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.555
- You totally look
like a junkie.

07:44.590 --> 07:46.228
- I'm not a junkie.

07:46.260 --> 07:47.728
- I didn't say that you were.

07:47.760 --> 07:48.693
- I'm sorry.

07:48.730 --> 07:50.198
No, I just woke up.

07:50.230 --> 07:51.823
I'm Aidan.

07:51.870 --> 07:54.896
- Oh, um, Nora said
goodish things about you.

07:54.940 --> 07:57.068
- Goodish things...
OK, well, T'll take that.

07:57.110 --> 07:58.965
- That's it.
Turn on the charm.

07:59.010 --> 07:59.932
Invite her in.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.039
- What can I do
for you, Kat?

08:02.080 --> 08:04.401
- Oh. I have a rent
cheque for her.

08:04.450 --> 08:07.511
I'm subletting Nora's place
on the down low.

08:07.550 --> 08:09.314
Um, could you
give this to her?

08:09.350 --> 08:12.581
- And look at that wrist.
Succulent.

08:15.320 --> 08:17.880
- Go ahead.
Have a taste!

08:20.500 --> 08:21.820
- No?

08:21.860 --> 08:25.125
- Um, I'll see that
she gets it. Nice to meet you.

08:31.140 --> 08:33.575
- (Nora): Josh...
- Hi!

08:33.610 --> 08:37.399
- Uh, this is Liam McLean.
Connor and Brynn's father.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.145
- Hello.

08:39.179 --> 08:41.774
- Uh, Liam thought that
maybe you could help him.

08:41.820 --> 08:43.914
- Before he was murdered,

08:43.950 --> 08:46.282
my son wrote out
2 cheques in your name

08:46.320 --> 08:48.755
for the sum of $1,700.

08:48.790 --> 08:50.326
And I was thinking
maybe you could

08:50.360 --> 08:52.021
tell me something
about that.

08:56.700 --> 08:58.361
(Vacuum cleaner whirring)

08:58.400 --> 09:00.562
- Hey!
- Um...

09:00.600 --> 09:02.466
Are you sure you don't
want me to stay?

09:02.500 --> 09:03.865
It can be spooky around here.

09:03.910 --> 09:05.435
- Oh, no.
It doesn't bother me.

09:05.470 --> 09:07.700
- OK. Well, you're hard
as nails. Ha ha!

09:07.740 --> 09:09.139
I like it.

09:09.180 --> 09:10.648
Um, good night.

09:12.680 --> 09:14.045
- Oh, wait!
Hey, hold up.

09:14.080 --> 09:17.914
Um, my friends
Nick and Zoe are coming over

09:17.950 --> 09:19.543
and, uh,

09:19.590 --> 09:22.082
they make me wanna
blow my brains out. Um...

09:22.120 --> 09:23.724
- They sound like
lovely people.

09:23.760 --> 09:25.683
- Well, it's 'cause
they're a couple.

09:25.730 --> 09:28.791
And so I don't wanna
3rd-wheel it.

09:28.830 --> 09:30.127
So...

09:31.130 --> 09:33.667
- Are you asking me
to be the 4th wheel?

09:33.700 --> 09:34.633
(Chuckles)

09:34.670 --> 09:35.933
- Yes! Pretty much.

09:35.970 --> 09:37.108
(Both laugh)

09:37.140 --> 09:39.199
- OK.
- Yeah? Really?

09:39.240 --> 09:40.674
- Yeah, of course.
- Cool.

09:40.710 --> 09:41.939
OK, so 8:007?

09:41.980 --> 09:43.948
- Yeah, yeah. Like, 8:00.

09:43.980 --> 09:46.620
- Oh, and, like, if we could
just keep the talk

09:46.650 --> 09:49.039
of elderly private parts
to a minimum.

09:49.080 --> 09:50.514
- Well, I make no promises.

09:50.550 --> 09:51.688
(Both chuckle)

09:51.720 --> 09:53.085
All right,
See you tonight.

09:53.120 --> 09:54.110
- See ya!
- Bye.

09:56.120 --> 09:57.952
(Whooshing)

10:01.200 --> 10:02.122
(Sighs)

10:02.160 --> 10:04.299
- Hello!
- Good bye!

10:07.140 --> 10:09.438
- Oh, OK, you have
a skillet in your purse?

10:09.470 --> 10:11.939
- Yeah, well, it's cute
and portable and it's iron,

10:11.970 --> 10:13.506
so I'll be seeing you...

10:13.540 --> 10:15.907
- Wait a minute!

10:15.940 --> 10:16.873
(Laughs)

10:16.910 --> 10:18.776
I'm Max's mother!

10:18.810 --> 10:20.016
Just checking up on him.

10:21.020 --> 10:23.409
- I'm so sorry.
Hi. Oh my God.

10:23.450 --> 10:25.088
I'm Sally.

10:25.120 --> 10:26.713
- Why can you see me?

10:26.760 --> 10:29.320
- I'm open.

10:29.360 --> 10:33.854
- I see. And what do
you think about my Max?

10:33.900 --> 10:36.551
- I think we haven't known
each other that long.

10:36.600 --> 10:37.999
- He enjoys you.

10:38.030 --> 10:39.122
Max looks you
up and down

10:39.170 --> 10:41.195
when you're not looking,
like a leg of lamb.

10:41.240 --> 10:42.196
- That's nice.

10:42.240 --> 10:43.401
- I hope this works out

10:43.440 --> 10:45.306
better than
his other failures.

10:45.340 --> 10:46.501
- His failures?

10:46.540 --> 10:48.474
- Sally, go easy on my boy.

10:48.510 --> 10:51.150
And try not to pay too much
attention when he eats.

10:51.180 --> 10:53.410
He's a cautious swallower.

10:53.450 --> 10:54.417
(Whooshing)

10:54.450 --> 10:56.373
- What does that even mean?

10:56.420 --> 10:58.149
- (Josh): The money was
for research.

10:58.190 --> 11:01.012
I was studying
our mutual condition.

11:01.060 --> 11:03.381
- Condition?

11:03.430 --> 11:05.353
What exactly were you
trying to find out?

11:05.390 --> 11:06.585
- How to control it.

11:06.630 --> 11:09.793
Connor wanted to change more
often, I wanted to change less.

11:09.830 --> 11:11.662
- Less?

11:11.700 --> 11:13.190
- Yeah, like,
not at all.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.299
It didn't go anywhere.

11:15.340 --> 11:17.707
- And yet, it would appear
you got what you wanted.

11:17.740 --> 11:20.209
I can tell
you're not like us.

11:20.240 --> 11:23.642
It's no easy thing,
caging your wolf full-time.

11:23.680 --> 11:26.911
There's very few ways
of accomplishing that.

11:26.950 --> 11:29.920
And it sure as hell
doesn't happen in a lab.

11:30.850 --> 11:32.181
- No.

11:33.820 --> 11:35.686
I killed my maker.

11:37.160 --> 11:39.026
- He did it for me.

11:39.060 --> 11:40.721
The guy was gonna kill me,

11:40.760 --> 11:42.455
so he stepped in.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.936
- I respect that.

11:46.970 --> 11:48.768
You made Nora,

11:48.800 --> 11:53.033
and of course, we have to put
our children ahead of all else,

11:53.080 --> 11:54.832
including those who made us.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.406
- Yeah. Except that
Nora's my girlfriend

11:57.450 --> 11:59.179
and not my child,
but sure.

12:01.350 --> 12:02.886
- Well, thank you very much.

12:06.720 --> 12:08.119
- Good luck.

12:09.460 --> 12:12.350
(* R&B playing on stereo )

12:12.390 --> 12:14.654
- So he's taking me on a trip.

12:14.700 --> 12:16.259
- Oh wow!

12:16.300 --> 12:17.893
Unreal.

12:17.930 --> 12:21.764
- We're doing 3 weeks in India--
- What!

12:21.800 --> 12:24.508
- We'll start by chilling
in a hut on the beach in Agonda.

12:24.540 --> 12:25.632
- Wow!

12:25.670 --> 12:27.035
- Then we're
heading inland.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.673
- I'm so jealous
of you guys.

12:28.710 --> 12:31.270
Seriously, I want to stab you.
- Oh, yeah, me too.

12:32.680 --> 12:33.613
(Laughs)

12:33.650 --> 12:35.971
Not like a homicidal
jealousy but, you know,

12:36.020 --> 12:38.182
like, I've always
wanted to go to India.

12:38.220 --> 12:39.187
(Mother laughing)

12:39.220 --> 12:41.109
- He's lucky if
he gets off the couch.

12:44.430 --> 12:47.730
- (Sally): You guys are gonna
have the best time.

12:47.760 --> 12:49.558
- (Mother): India? Really?

12:49.600 --> 12:51.090
With all the crime?
The filth?

12:51.130 --> 12:53.565
Those people are born
and raised in garbage.

12:53.600 --> 12:55.762
- I'm Indian.
- (Mother): Sorry.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.063
- Congratulations.

12:58.640 --> 13:01.075
- See, look, the swallowing.

13:02.680 --> 13:04.842
He gets that from his father.

13:05.810 --> 13:07.869
- Who wants more wine?
- Yeah!

13:07.920 --> 13:09.775
- Me!
- You? Good? Everyone?

13:14.320 --> 13:16.357
(Whooshing)

13:20.460 --> 13:22.554
- (Whispering):
What are you doing here?

13:22.600 --> 13:23.965
- I always go on Max's dates.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.321
It's the first time
anyone's been able to see me.

13:26.370 --> 13:28.498
Are you all in
some sort of cult?

13:28.540 --> 13:29.860
- We are not in a cult!

13:29.910 --> 13:33.869
We are a group of people trying
to have a nice, private evening.

13:33.910 --> 13:36.333
- I can take a hint.
- Can you, though?

13:36.380 --> 13:37.973
(Whooshing)

13:38.950 --> 13:40.076
(Siren wailing outside)

13:40.120 --> 13:41.349
(Clears throat)

13:43.620 --> 13:45.145
(Sighs)

13:46.090 --> 13:48.218
- There he is! The murderer!

13:48.260 --> 13:50.388
(Frankenstein moaning on TV)

13:50.430 --> 13:53.297
(People shouting on TV)

13:55.800 --> 13:58.462
- Hey, Nurse Aidan,
what's up?

13:58.500 --> 14:02.459
- I'm up -- at midnight --
to tell you to turn the TV off.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.002
Your neighbours
are complaining.

14:04.040 --> 14:05.530
- I'll turn it
down in a sec.

14:05.570 --> 14:07.971
- How about off?
- Oh, come on, please!

14:08.010 --> 14:10.570
The Fog is on in 5 minutes.
- The Fog? Oh, OK.

14:10.610 --> 14:13.341
Wait a second, the 1979
or the 2005 version?

14:13.380 --> 14:15.178
- 1979. Please.

14:16.550 --> 14:19.383
- Turn it down.
- Yes! Thank you.

14:21.020 --> 14:22.658
(Sighs)

14:24.030 --> 14:26.158
- You all right?
You look like doodoo.

14:26.190 --> 14:27.328
(Sighs)

14:27.360 --> 14:30.022
Yeah, I skipped dinner.
- You can have some of mine.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.026
(Aidan sniffs)

14:31.070 --> 14:32.469
- What is that, garlic bread?

14:32.500 --> 14:34.559
- Yeah.

14:34.600 --> 14:35.999
(Chuckles)

14:36.040 --> 14:37.530
- No thanks.

14:37.570 --> 14:40.176
I--I don't wanna go through
my shift with bad breath.

14:40.210 --> 14:41.405
- All right,
Suit yourself,

14:41.440 --> 14:43.374
Hey, do you want to
stay with me for a bit?

14:43.410 --> 14:45.208
You can watch some
of this if you want.

14:45.250 --> 14:46.877
It's a good movie. Original.
- Uh...

14:46.920 --> 14:49.139
- (Beth): Why are you kidding
yourself like this?

14:49.180 --> 14:50.989
- Unlike the remake
which was terrible.

14:51.020 --> 14:52.840
- (Beth): You know
why you came here.

14:52.890 --> 14:54.654
(Kenny continues
talking, indistinct)

14:54.690 --> 14:55.987
Check your pocket.

14:56.020 --> 14:59.058
- (Kenny): That sounds like
a song by the Spice Girls...

14:59.090 --> 15:00.797
- Yeah, you put
that there.

15:00.830 --> 15:02.719
The hunger's
taking control

15:02.760 --> 15:03.966
and the longer you wait,

15:04.000 --> 15:05.923
the more the hunger grows,

15:05.970 --> 15:07.836
the more likely
you are to drain him.

15:07.870 --> 15:09.429
- I'd like to
see that.

15:09.470 --> 15:12.303
- I would've felt more
comfortable

15:12.340 --> 15:15.105
watching Precious
on repeat with my parents.

15:15.140 --> 15:16.539
- But, if you start now,

15:16.580 --> 15:19.675
you can drain him
just a little bit at a time.

15:19.710 --> 15:22.645
- (Kenny): So, what do you say?
Pull up a chair.

15:22.680 --> 15:26.719
- No, man, I just got
too much to do.

15:26.750 --> 15:29.082
- Come on!
Do it!

15:29.120 --> 15:31.726
- Including taking
some blood from you!

15:31.760 --> 15:34.730
- Are you serious?
Dude, it's after midnight.

15:34.760 --> 15:36.489
- They want
bacterial cultures.

15:37.600 --> 15:38.761
- Fine.

15:39.930 --> 15:41.830
Don't make me
miss this movie.

15:55.020 --> 15:56.875
- (Zoe): So his mom
is always around?

15:56.920 --> 15:58.081
- Yup.

15:58.120 --> 16:01.112
- That's what you get,
working in a funeral home.

16:01.160 --> 16:02.685
How about those
new ghosts, right?

16:02.720 --> 16:04.279
Like freshmen
at orientation,

16:04.330 --> 16:05.855
all wide-eyed
and slack jawed.

16:05.890 --> 16:07.426
- Yeah. I just disperse them.

16:08.360 --> 16:09.521
- Disperse them?

16:09.560 --> 16:11.722
After all you went
through after you died,

16:11.770 --> 16:13.238
after what people
did for you,

16:13.270 --> 16:14.692
including myself?

16:14.740 --> 16:16.094
- I can't help these people.

16:16.140 --> 16:17.960
- You don't know that.

16:19.040 --> 16:20.269
- But I do.

16:20.310 --> 16:22.472
Any time I've ever
used any power,

16:22.510 --> 16:23.841
it's been a disaster.

16:23.880 --> 16:27.919
People get hurt. People end up
in psych wards or shredded.

16:27.950 --> 16:30.180
I can't keep
devastating people.

16:31.790 --> 16:34.179
Maybe dispersing
them seems harsh, but...

16:35.090 --> 16:36.910
they're better off
without me.

16:39.130 --> 16:41.053
- (Nick): It was
really nice meeting you.

16:41.100 --> 16:43.023
- Bye, you guys!
- Konichiwa, bitches!

16:43.070 --> 16:45.562
- That means hello, but OK.
- (Nick): Yes, it does!

16:45.600 --> 16:46.920
(Chuckles)

16:49.470 --> 16:52.565
- So, uh, do you still wanna
blow your brains out?

16:52.610 --> 16:53.532
- No!
- No?

16:53.580 --> 16:54.877
- You saved me.
Thank you.

16:54.910 --> 16:57.140
- Oh... Oh! Um...

16:57.180 --> 17:00.172
** Takes a long time
to lose it *

17:00.220 --> 17:04.214
* Takes a long time
to lose it **

17:04.250 --> 17:06.480
Uh, good night! Um...

17:06.520 --> 17:08.659
- Yeah, OK. Well,
good night to you.

17:08.690 --> 17:09.760
- Yeah, good night!

17:18.400 --> 17:20.289
(* The Pack A.D.
performing Take * )

17:20.339 --> 17:22.536

take everything I love *

I suppose **

18:15.160 --> 18:16.559
(Birds chirping)

18:17.290 --> 18:19.156
- Rise and shine!

18:19.190 --> 18:21.022
- (Kenny): Mmm, no.
I need more sleep.

18:21.060 --> 18:23.028
- Maybe you shouldn't
stay up all night.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.767
Let me have your arm.
- Oh come on!

18:24.800 --> 18:26.666
What's up with
all the double dipping?

18:26.700 --> 18:29.067
I just gave
a sample last night

18:29.100 --> 18:31.410
for, um, bacterial
cultures or something.

18:35.410 --> 18:37.242
- I don't have that down here.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.009
- How much blood
do you people need?

18:39.050 --> 18:40.643
- Come on, sweetie, let's go.

18:52.630 --> 18:54.394
- Hey...

18:54.430 --> 18:57.127
You wanna play "Guess
what's in this sandwich?"

18:57.170 --> 18:58.262
- Are we playing?

18:58.300 --> 18:59.790
- Oh, we're playing.
- Yeah, OK!

18:59.830 --> 19:01.662
- OK...

19:03.340 --> 19:05.468
Guess what's
in this sandwich.

19:12.750 --> 19:13.774
- Peanut butter...

19:13.820 --> 19:15.219
(Laughs)

19:16.720 --> 19:18.518
And bol--
And olive loaf!

19:18.550 --> 19:19.688
(Laughs)

19:19.720 --> 19:21.256
Is that what it is?
- You're good!

19:21.290 --> 19:23.850
- I'm good at this game.
Where'd you find olive loaf?

19:23.890 --> 19:26.530
- Oh, hey, your friend Kat
dropped this off for you.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.324
- Wait! Kat was here?

19:28.360 --> 19:30.670
- Yup.
- Alone?

19:32.000 --> 19:33.866
- (Sighing): OK. Um...

19:33.900 --> 19:37.302
You're nervous about people
coming over here alone

19:37.340 --> 19:38.967
to find a hungry vampire.

19:39.010 --> 19:42.640
- Actually, you don't seem
to be that hungry anymore.

19:42.680 --> 19:45.980
- I figured something out.
- You figured some-- What?

19:46.010 --> 19:48.775
What'd you figure out?
- It's Kenny.

19:48.820 --> 19:51.482
- The bubble boy?
- I'm desperate!

19:51.520 --> 19:53.045
He wasn't exposed
to the virus

19:53.090 --> 19:55.309
and I don't wanna start
drinking live again

19:55.360 --> 19:56.555
and so he's the only--

19:56.590 --> 19:58.729
It's no different than
taking from blood bags.

19:58.760 --> 20:01.422
- Yeah, except that
this bag has a name and face.

20:01.460 --> 20:03.519
- No one Iin
this room is clean.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.762
This isn't the way
that I wanted to do it...

20:07.800 --> 20:09.234
(Clears throat)

20:09.270 --> 20:12.035
But with the virus, this is
the world I live in now.

20:12.070 --> 20:13.606
And the longer I hold out,

20:13.640 --> 20:16.769
that's when you need to be
worried about people like Kat.

20:16.810 --> 20:18.574
OK? I don't expect you
to understand.

20:18.610 --> 20:21.011
- You're right.
I don't understand.

20:26.750 --> 20:29.651
- Wanna--wanna play "Guess
what's in this sandwich?"

20:32.090 --> 20:33.455
To me.

20:39.100 --> 20:42.889
- You know, the viewing room
is, uh, is really a nice space,

20:42.940 --> 20:45.500
you know,
when people aren't,

20:45.540 --> 20:46.962
well, you know,

20:47.010 --> 20:49.934
- Viewing a dead body in it?
- Yeah. Yeah.

20:49.980 --> 20:54.611
<i>** 1 dreamed that
we had awaken *</i>

20:54.650 --> 20:58.587
* By a clear pool
of still water *

21:03.220 --> 21:05.427
- OK, um...

21:07.460 --> 21:09.895
I've been thinking
about something.

21:09.930 --> 21:12.228
- Is it about how I uh...

21:12.270 --> 21:14.489
I didn't kiss you
last night?

21:14.540 --> 21:17.669
Um, even though
you wanted to?

21:18.570 --> 21:22.837
I was kicking myself
the whole walk home.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.639
I mean, you leaned in
and everything.

21:25.680 --> 21:26.806
(Chuckles)

21:26.850 --> 21:28.443
- I did.

21:31.590 --> 21:33.979
- Can we try this again?

21:34.020 --> 21:35.988
Just go out,

21:36.020 --> 21:38.227
just the two of us.

21:39.190 --> 21:41.295
- Yeah, I'd like that.

21:42.330 --> 21:45.368
* Love weigh you down *

21:46.300 --> 21:50.601
* Love weigh you down

21:50.640 --> 21:54.702
* Let my love weigh you down

21:54.740 --> 21:55.878
* Love weigh you down

21:55.910 --> 21:57.400
- Max, I'm leaning
in here.

21:58.380 --> 21:59.677
<i>- I know.</i>

22:22.300 --> 22:24.302
- What are you doing here?

22:24.340 --> 22:26.069
- Pulling a double.

22:29.910 --> 22:31.844
- What-- No, no, no! Um...

22:31.880 --> 22:34.212
No, I--I want some natural
sunlight for this.

22:34.250 --> 22:35.570
- What's with the camera?

22:35.620 --> 22:37.816
- Uh, you know,
just a new little toy.

22:37.850 --> 22:42.356
I thought I'd document some
more of my caged adventures.

22:42.390 --> 22:44.427
Say hello!
- Hello!

22:44.460 --> 22:47.122
- Um, could you actually
go back over?

22:47.160 --> 22:49.128
The natural sunlight
looked really good.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.067
Perfect! What's wrong?

22:54.100 --> 22:55.465
You don't like sunlight?

22:55.500 --> 22:56.729
- Not when I'm exhausted

22:56.770 --> 22:59.102
and it's directly
in my face, not really.

22:59.140 --> 23:01.905
- Um, could you walk
in front of the mirror?

23:01.940 --> 23:05.877
I wanna try to get a frame-
within-a-frame sort of shot.

23:09.620 --> 23:12.248
- How's this?
- It's good.

23:13.320 --> 23:16.358
Subject has reflection.
- What's that?

23:16.390 --> 23:18.381
- I like the reflection.
It's cool.

23:20.330 --> 23:22.389
- OK, that's a wrap. Ha ha!

23:22.430 --> 23:24.125
I'll catch you later, Kenny.

23:31.110 --> 23:32.908
- Well, you were right,

23:32.940 --> 23:35.477
the viewing room
iS a nice room.

23:35.510 --> 23:38.400
It is a good room.

23:39.310 --> 23:41.779
- We did it in the viewing room.
- Yeah!

23:44.450 --> 23:46.009
- It's just,
like, I mean...

23:46.050 --> 23:49.259
This is, like, unprofessional.

23:49.290 --> 23:52.157
I mean, this is supposed
to be, like, a place of comfort.

23:52.190 --> 23:55.421
- It is a place of comfort.
I'm very comfortable.

23:55.460 --> 23:59.294
My back feels,
like, amazing.

23:59.330 --> 24:02.789
- People are gonna be
in here, like, sobbing

24:02.840 --> 24:05.468
and they're gonna be looking
at their dead loved one

24:05.510 --> 24:07.979
and I'm gonna be standing
right next to them, OK,

24:08.010 --> 24:10.809
but I'm not gonna
be thinking about them

24:10.850 --> 24:12.705
when I hand
them tissues, you know?

24:12.750 --> 24:14.377
I'm gonna be
thinking about...

24:15.320 --> 24:16.913
the couch...

24:16.950 --> 24:18.179
(Laughs)

24:18.220 --> 24:19.710
...naked, naughty Sally.

24:19.750 --> 24:21.787
- When did I become
Naughty Sally?

24:21.820 --> 24:25.222
- I'm not gonna say anything
smart, right now, OK,

24:25.260 --> 24:28.798
so I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna go back to work.

24:28.830 --> 24:32.289
OK?
- No... Just...

24:32.330 --> 24:33.991
- I-I'm sorry.

24:42.240 --> 24:43.435
- Disgusting.

24:43.480 --> 24:45.141
I knew you were selfish,

24:45.180 --> 24:47.239
the way you dealt
with that old man.

24:47.280 --> 24:49.248
But now I find out
you're a slut too.

24:49.280 --> 24:51.510
Just like all the other
sluts he chased around.

24:51.550 --> 24:54.156
- Slow your roll, Linda.

24:54.190 --> 24:55.658
I'm sorry you had
to see that,

24:55.690 --> 24:58.182
but maybe if you didn't
creep around like a weirdo...

24:58.230 --> 25:00.449
- You took his flower!

25:00.490 --> 25:02.458
- His flower?

25:02.500 --> 25:06.095
- I've spent my entire afterlife
protecting that boy

25:06.130 --> 25:08.667
for just the right girl,

25:08.700 --> 25:11.567
and you waltz in here
and throw it at him.

25:11.610 --> 25:12.532
- Excuse me?

25:12.570 --> 25:14.436
I did not throw it at him.

25:14.480 --> 25:15.800
- I'm warning you, Sally.

25:15.840 --> 25:17.501
You stay away from Max.

25:17.550 --> 25:19.973
- You know what, Linda,
maybe next time I see Max,

25:20.010 --> 25:21.910
I will throw it at him.

25:21.950 --> 25:24.317
I'll sling it!
I'll sling it at him!

25:26.920 --> 25:29.981
- Some idiot keeps
tearing down all the fliers.

25:30.990 --> 25:32.583
- It's probably Erin.

25:33.830 --> 25:36.322
- That's good. It means
she's still in town.

25:36.360 --> 25:38.124
- I need to have
a word with you.

25:41.840 --> 25:43.535
As I'm sure you know,

25:43.570 --> 25:46.369
a virus has been
spreading rather rampantly

25:46.410 --> 25:47.809
among the vampires.

25:47.840 --> 25:50.673
- Yeah, we'd heard
something about that.

25:50.710 --> 25:52.747
- Well, we've been
hunting them down,

25:52.780 --> 25:55.044
attempting to fulfill
the will of nature.

25:55.080 --> 25:56.241
Finish them off.

25:58.390 --> 26:01.087
It was all going along rather
smoothly until last night

26:01.120 --> 26:03.851
we encountered a leech that
was neither sick nor hungry.

26:03.890 --> 26:06.825
In fact, he was
incredibly strong.

26:06.860 --> 26:11.093
I did still manage, however,
to track him back to his house.

26:11.130 --> 26:13.064
The one he shares
with the two of you.

26:13.100 --> 26:14.499
- Aidan is a good man.

26:14.540 --> 26:15.837
- He's a vampire,

26:15.870 --> 26:17.190
and his unnatural strength,

26:17.240 --> 26:20.005
in combination with his
predisposition for violence,

26:20.040 --> 26:21.735
makes him a threat
to us all.

26:21.780 --> 26:23.669
He needs to be stopped.

26:26.480 --> 26:30.041
And since he may have
spotted me last night,

26:30.080 --> 26:32.390
I need someone
he doesn't expect.

26:32.420 --> 26:34.013
Somebody close.

26:35.020 --> 26:37.318
- I can't do
what you're asking.

26:37.360 --> 26:41.251
- I'm not asking you to do
anything. I'm asking you.

26:41.300 --> 26:44.622
I see in you what I know
I saw in my children, Nora.

26:44.670 --> 26:46.399
You're connected.

26:46.430 --> 26:48.194
You know.

26:48.240 --> 26:50.629
This is our time.

26:50.670 --> 26:52.365
- You really don't
know me that well.

26:52.410 --> 26:54.333
- Do you think
for a minute

26:54.380 --> 26:57.077
that if the shoe were on the
other foot, he'd hesitate?

27:03.480 --> 27:04.686
- No!

27:06.420 --> 27:09.219
- This is where I'm staying.

27:09.260 --> 27:11.058
You can reach me here.

27:14.330 --> 27:16.094
Let me know
when it's done.

27:16.130 --> 27:17.894
Either you two
take care of him,

27:17.930 --> 27:19.921
or I'll have to
take care of you.

27:35.680 --> 27:39.139
(* Hip hop in earphones,
lyrics indistinct *)

27:39.690 --> 27:41.180
- Max...

27:46.790 --> 27:48.019
I'm leaving.

27:49.260 --> 27:53.197
- Um, OK, well T'll--
I'll go out with you.

27:53.230 --> 27:56.291
- Good lord,
you're dense. Um...

27:57.710 --> 27:59.200
I'm quitting.

28:01.010 --> 28:02.375
- Why?

28:02.410 --> 28:03.673
Is this about before?

28:03.710 --> 28:06.873
- OK, well, first,
this is a funeral home.

28:06.910 --> 28:09.447
I think I can do
better than that.

28:09.480 --> 28:12.643
Also, I wasn't expecting
to be assaulted at work.

28:12.690 --> 28:13.885
- OK, hold on.

28:13.920 --> 28:16.810
Um, what we did...
I know it wasn't professional,

28:16.860 --> 28:21.525
but, like, I'm pretty sure that
we assaulted each other, here.

28:21.560 --> 28:23.221
- I was curious...

28:24.430 --> 28:28.469
and now that curiosity
has been satisfied.

28:32.870 --> 28:34.702
You missed a button.

28:35.840 --> 28:38.002
Learn how to
dress yourself,

28:40.820 --> 28:42.413
- (Nora):
What are we gonna do?

28:42.450 --> 28:45.488
- What do you mean, "what are we
gonna do?" Nothing to do!

28:45.520 --> 28:46.817
It's not like we're...

28:47.790 --> 28:49.519
killing Aidan.

28:50.660 --> 28:52.480
(Sighs)

28:55.900 --> 28:57.299
Right, Nora?

28:57.330 --> 29:00.220
You're not actually entertaining
that notion, are you?

29:00.270 --> 29:03.035
- No, God. I can't
even think right now.

29:03.070 --> 29:06.199
Liam... You don't understand.
You didn't turn with him.

29:06.240 --> 29:08.174
He is a whole other
level of terrifying.

29:08.210 --> 29:10.679
- I know. I know.
- I'm just--

29:10.710 --> 29:12.075
I'm trying to think, OK?

29:12.110 --> 29:15.512
So let's just set our emotions
aside for a second here.

29:15.550 --> 29:17.018
- Set our emotions aside?

29:17.050 --> 29:19.940
So, OK, great, so let's
actually have a conversation

29:19.990 --> 29:21.583
about murdering
my best friend.

29:21.620 --> 29:24.260
- Of course I don't wanna
murder Aidan, OK?

29:24.290 --> 29:25.849
- Well then what
are you saying?

29:25.890 --> 29:28.621
- He made himself clear.
If we do nothing, he'll kill us.

29:28.660 --> 29:31.197
And he will.
I promise you that.

29:31.230 --> 29:33.028
- Killing Aidan
won't stop Liam

29:33.070 --> 29:34.265
from sniffing around us.

29:34.300 --> 29:35.938
- No, I know that.

29:35.970 --> 29:37.938
But it's not like
Aidan is so innocent.

29:37.970 --> 29:40.530
He killed Connor right
in front of us in cold blood.

29:40.570 --> 29:43.369
Have you ever stopped to wonder
how many people he's killed?

29:43.410 --> 29:44.741
It could be
in the thousands.

29:44.780 --> 29:47.943
- That doesn't make this OK!
- No, I know that, Josh!

29:47.980 --> 29:49.618
Nothing makes this OK!

29:49.650 --> 29:51.812
- We can't have this
conversation right now.

29:51.850 --> 29:54.353
- We have to do something.
- I know we have to.

29:54.390 --> 29:56.779
But we're not
gonna do this.

29:58.690 --> 30:00.158
Unreal!

30:04.430 --> 30:06.398
(Woman clearing throat)

30:08.440 --> 30:09.896
- Good morning!

30:13.880 --> 30:15.200
- What are you doing here?

30:15.240 --> 30:16.639
- You don't have to get up.

30:16.680 --> 30:19.069
You're not going to work
today or ever again.

30:19.110 --> 30:21.477
- What are you talking about?

30:21.520 --> 30:23.443
- You quit your job.

30:23.480 --> 30:24.743
- No, I didn't.

30:25.890 --> 30:27.619
- You might not remember.

30:30.590 --> 30:32.354
Sally, I warned you.

30:35.130 --> 30:37.428
You going to see Max?
- Bet your ass!

30:37.460 --> 30:39.326
- And you're gonna
tell him what?

30:39.370 --> 30:41.634
That his mother was inside
you after he was?

30:41.670 --> 30:42.865
That won't sound great.

30:42.900 --> 30:45.904
Not that he wants to hear
anything from you right now.

30:45.940 --> 30:47.567
You were really harsh to him.

30:47.610 --> 30:48.805
(Whooshing)

30:48.840 --> 30:50.706
(Exhales sharply)

30:53.550 --> 30:55.109
(Monster roaring)

30:55.150 --> 30:57.369
- (Aidan):
Um... There we go.

30:58.320 --> 31:00.482
All right.
I think we're good!

31:01.420 --> 31:03.184
- Hey, um...

31:03.220 --> 31:06.451
Check this out!

31:09.660 --> 31:11.367
Do you like it?

31:11.400 --> 31:12.925
My grandma gave it to me.

31:12.970 --> 31:17.396
Some monk supposedly
spent years carving it.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.033
- Nice.

31:19.070 --> 31:21.573
Looks like that monk really
carved the crap out of it.

31:21.610 --> 31:23.829
I'm gonna take
this to the lab.

31:23.880 --> 31:25.609
- Right.

31:25.650 --> 31:27.914
Bottoms up!

31:29.780 --> 31:31.009
- Are you OK?

31:32.650 --> 31:35.950
- OK, I, um... I have to
ask you a question.

31:35.990 --> 31:40.257
It's gonna sound crazy, but
you have to answer honestly, OK?

31:40.290 --> 31:41.826
(Chuckles)

31:41.860 --> 31:44.727
- OK. I'm intrigued.
Let's have it.

31:44.770 --> 31:46.295
(Sighs)

31:46.330 --> 31:47.820
- Are you a--

31:47.870 --> 31:49.429
(Clears throat)

31:49.470 --> 31:50.835
Are you a vampire?

31:51.970 --> 31:53.335
- Um...

31:54.380 --> 31:55.734
No...

31:55.780 --> 31:58.909
What--what are you--
Are you serious?

31:58.950 --> 32:01.920
(Laughing)

32:01.950 --> 32:04.840
I thought that we were gonna
have some sort of talk

32:04.890 --> 32:07.018
about the birds
and the bees.

32:07.050 --> 32:08.279
Well, that was
a close one.

32:08.320 --> 32:09.617
- What are you doing?

32:09.660 --> 32:12.960
- Uh, you are on horror-movie
detention, my friend.

32:12.990 --> 32:15.425
I want nothing but rom-come
on that TV from now on.

32:15.460 --> 32:17.519
Next time you can
accuse me of being Meg Ryan.

32:17.560 --> 32:19.961
- No, no, you can't do that.
I'm not a child.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.469
- Really? 'Cause
you just acted like one.

32:22.500 --> 32:24.605
Vampires?
- Oh--

32:24.640 --> 32:26.267
- Really?

32:27.840 --> 32:29.103
(Laughing)

32:38.290 --> 32:40.179
- Can you believe
she possessed me?

32:40.220 --> 32:42.655
- You do see the karmic
justice in this though.

32:42.690 --> 32:43.816
- Yes, I do, thank you.

32:43.860 --> 32:45.658
I'm newly disgusted
with myself, OK?

32:45.690 --> 32:48.091
But I'm not the only
victim here. What about Max?

32:48.130 --> 32:51.566
How can he ever lead a normal
life with her hanging around?

32:51.600 --> 32:55.389
- The man dresses up dead people
like dolls for a living.

32:55.440 --> 32:57.397
Define normal.
- I need to stop her.

32:57.440 --> 33:00.239
But I just can't get close
to her without being possessed.

33:02.980 --> 33:04.641
It's cute. Very nice.

33:04.680 --> 33:06.899
- It's a soul lock,

33:06.950 --> 33:08.873
designed by the hill
people of Thailand.

33:08.920 --> 33:12.379
It binds the soul to the body
and protects it from ghosts.

33:14.390 --> 33:15.983
- Are you serious?

33:16.020 --> 33:18.352
- I never kid about
spirits or jewellery.

33:18.390 --> 33:19.880
- Where did you find this?

33:19.930 --> 33:21.921
- A souvenir shop in
the Bangkok airport.

33:21.960 --> 33:23.758
Turns out the damn
thing works.

33:27.630 --> 33:32.329
Now go forth!
Deliver the smackdown.

33:33.210 --> 33:35.372
(Car horn honking)

33:48.790 --> 33:50.258
- Is it done?

33:57.260 --> 33:58.762
(Sighs)

34:03.370 --> 34:06.305
- I'm not killing Aidan.
Neither is Nora.

34:06.340 --> 34:07.933
- Well, that's a problem.

34:09.980 --> 34:13.643
- You have family, a pack
to protect. I get that.

34:13.679 --> 34:15.318
When I was first turned,

34:15.350 --> 34:17.409
I didn't have a wolf
there to help me.

34:18.389 --> 34:20.119
There was only Aidan.

34:20.150 --> 34:23.552
He protected me
from the vampires.

34:23.590 --> 34:25.080
And now it's
my turn to help him.

34:25.130 --> 34:28.350
- And do you really think
that gun can stop me

34:28.400 --> 34:29.652
from killing you?

34:29.699 --> 34:31.360
- No.

34:31.400 --> 34:33.619
No, I just wanted to buy
enough time to tell you

34:33.670 --> 34:35.434
to keep Nora out of this.

34:35.469 --> 34:38.303
Aidan's my friend,
my family.

34:38.340 --> 34:41.878
Just like she is.
Leave them alone.

34:43.179 --> 34:45.045
And I've warned Aidan.

34:45.080 --> 34:47.549
He's not a man
I would underestimate.

34:48.520 --> 34:49.976
- You should go.

34:51.949 --> 34:53.246
- What does that mean?

34:56.090 --> 34:58.730
- Go. Now.

35:09.200 --> 35:10.429
(Inhales sharply)

35:11.970 --> 35:13.460
(Car horn honking)

35:21.520 --> 35:22.772
- Here you go!

35:23.880 --> 35:25.348
- Hey, um...

35:27.520 --> 35:31.150
You know, I don't...
I don't meet people.

35:33.290 --> 35:35.429
I don't make many friends.

35:35.460 --> 35:38.327
The ones I do make, they
hang out with me for a while

35:38.370 --> 35:43.160
before getting bored and then
going off to have a life.

35:44.340 --> 35:45.899
I get bored too.

35:45.940 --> 35:48.978
But I don't have
that as an option,

35:49.010 --> 35:53.675
so I guess I just tried to make
a little drama where I could.

35:53.710 --> 35:56.509
- It's OK. Everybody daydreams.

35:56.550 --> 35:59.087
- No, I accused you
of being a vampire.

35:59.120 --> 36:00.281
- Oh, I know.

36:00.320 --> 36:03.312
And I'm gonna forget about that,
and so should you.

36:03.360 --> 36:05.226
- What if I'm going crazy?

36:05.260 --> 36:07.558
- You're not.

36:07.590 --> 36:10.059
You wanna know how I know?
- Please.

36:11.030 --> 36:12.429
(Car engine revving on TV)

36:12.470 --> 36:16.361
- Because I don't watch
TV with crazy people.

36:16.400 --> 36:18.129
They talk too much.

36:18.170 --> 36:20.104
(Both chuckle)

36:26.080 --> 36:27.969
- Hello?

36:30.080 --> 36:31.343
Linda?

36:36.920 --> 36:38.979
- Did you leave
something behind?

36:40.890 --> 36:43.359
- I just have one last mess
to clean up.

36:43.400 --> 36:46.825
- (Chuckling): Oh, you're cute,
I'll give you that.

36:46.870 --> 36:48.736
Here, let me help you
find the exit.

36:53.340 --> 36:55.832
- Soul lock, bitch!

36:55.880 --> 36:58.577
Score one for
the hill people of Thailand.

36:59.750 --> 37:02.447
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like, Linda?

37:02.480 --> 37:04.118
I'm gonna exorcise you.

37:08.590 --> 37:09.887
God our father,

37:09.920 --> 37:12.719
cleanse this place of the
dark remnant that dwells within

37:12.760 --> 37:14.353
and fill it with light and love.

37:18.300 --> 37:20.519
- You can't do this!
You have no right!

37:20.570 --> 37:22.265
- Be gone, spirit.

37:22.300 --> 37:24.735
Leave this world for those
who still live in it.

37:24.770 --> 37:26.260
- I love him.

37:26.310 --> 37:28.039
You can't know!

37:28.070 --> 37:30.402
- Nobody can love your son.
You won't let them!

37:31.680 --> 37:34.320
- I just want Max to be happy.

37:39.320 --> 37:40.981
- But he's not.

37:41.020 --> 37:42.510
He's lonely.

37:42.560 --> 37:45.450
You can't want that for him,
I know you can't.

37:45.490 --> 37:47.185
(Sniffling)

37:51.160 --> 37:53.766
- So he just let you go?

37:53.800 --> 37:55.791
- He was still on edge,
I was holding a gun.

37:55.840 --> 37:57.831
It's not like we hugged
it out or anything.

37:57.870 --> 38:00.840
- I never should've
let you handle this.

38:00.870 --> 38:03.669
- You didn't let me
handle anything.

38:03.710 --> 38:06.645
I know I'm not
special anymore,

38:06.680 --> 38:08.318
like everyone else
in this house,

38:08.350 --> 38:12.480
but I still have to protect
the people that I love.

38:12.520 --> 38:14.181
(Knocking at door)

38:19.930 --> 38:23.252
- I have something for you.

38:26.330 --> 38:28.025
- Oh my God!
- Erin!

38:28.070 --> 38:30.869
- Do you have something
you'd like to say?

38:30.900 --> 38:32.732
- I'm sorry
I took off like that.

38:32.770 --> 38:34.306
- Thank you so much.

38:34.340 --> 38:35.671
- She was in a squat

38:35.710 --> 38:36.871
with some
unsavoury types.

38:36.910 --> 38:38.105
- They're not unsavoury.

38:38.140 --> 38:40.746
- They tried to steal
my car. She's all yours.

38:40.780 --> 38:42.942
- You're just in time.
We're about to eat.

38:42.980 --> 38:44.641
Liam, would you like to join us?

38:44.690 --> 38:47.079
- I have things to do,
but thank you.

38:59.170 --> 39:01.889
That was stupid, coming at me
with a gun like that.

39:01.940 --> 39:03.635
- I didn't know
what else to do.

39:03.670 --> 39:06.002
- It was also very brave.

39:06.040 --> 39:08.338
You have a full family now.

39:08.380 --> 39:12.044
I suggest you take better care
of them than I did of mine.

39:16.420 --> 39:18.218
(Siren wailing in distance)

39:18.250 --> 39:20.344
*k%k Ni
Night *

39:22.790 --> 39:25.327
* This night...

39:26.260 --> 39:29.252
- Hey...
- Hey...

39:31.330 --> 39:33.094
- Thanks for meeting me.

39:33.130 --> 39:35.565
- Well, what do you want
to talk about?

39:35.600 --> 39:37.398
I thought your curiosity
was satisfied.

39:37.440 --> 39:41.365
- Um, I just wanted
to apologize.

39:42.640 --> 39:44.278
That wasn't me yesterday.

39:44.310 --> 39:46.642
- Well, which one were you?

39:46.680 --> 39:48.978
The sweet, beautiful girl
from the grieving room,

39:49.020 --> 39:50.510
or the one
that walked out on me?

39:50.550 --> 39:53.281
- I don't even know
what happened.

39:53.320 --> 39:57.018
I freaked out.
I'm so sorry.

39:57.060 --> 39:59.984
It's been
a really long time

40:00.030 --> 40:02.624
since I've had
a connection like this.

40:02.660 --> 40:04.526
- It's been even
longer for me.

40:05.670 --> 40:08.025
Like, forever longer.

40:10.570 --> 40:12.629
You...

40:14.680 --> 40:16.500
You really hurt me.

40:16.540 --> 40:18.304
(Sighs)

40:21.080 --> 40:26.439
- Do you think there's any
chance we could just start over?

40:30.920 --> 40:34.129
- On one condition.

40:34.160 --> 40:37.095
No more sex in
the funeral home.

40:37.130 --> 40:39.622
- I make no promises.

40:43.500 --> 40:46.538
* This house is dark *

40:48.070 --> 40:51.973
* Nothing moves inside

41:01.660 --> 41:04.880
* It's night *

41:07.430 --> 41:09.398
- Hey!

41:11.100 --> 41:12.329
- Oh, hey!

41:12.370 --> 41:13.667
- What are you up to?

41:13.700 --> 41:15.236
- Oh, I'm sorry,

41:15.270 --> 41:17.398
I was talking to Kenny
and I must've dozed off.

41:17.440 --> 41:19.033
I've been covering shifts.

41:19.070 --> 41:20.902
- You know what
I'm talking about.

41:20.940 --> 41:22.931
The blood you're taking
from this kid.

41:22.980 --> 41:24.948
- I wasn't taking...
Those were for tests.

41:24.980 --> 41:26.846
- Tests? I checked.

41:26.880 --> 41:28.041
None have been
scheduled.

41:28.080 --> 41:30.572
- There's gotta be
some sort of mistake.

41:30.620 --> 41:32.440
- You know what?
I'm filing a report.

41:32.490 --> 41:34.652
Tonight. You can explain
it to administration.

41:34.690 --> 41:37.159
- Hold on! You don't know
anything about any blood.

41:37.190 --> 41:38.658
Everything is fine.

41:38.690 --> 41:40.624
- Get your hands off me!

41:53.240 --> 41:54.833
(Gasps)

41:57.680 --> 41:59.648
(Whimpering)

41:59.680 --> 42:00.977
(Crying)

42:16.800 --> 42:18.222
(Man screaming on TV)

42:18.260 --> 42:19.728
(Sighs)

42:32.780 --> 42:35.147
- Looks like the cats
are out of the bag!

42:35.180 --> 42:36.978
(Giggling)

42:53.500 --> 42:57.164
(* Man singing rockabilly,
lyrics indistinct *)
