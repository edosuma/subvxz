02:36.694 --> 02:39.517
- [Nicole] Hey babe, how was your day?

02:39.517 --> 02:40.590
- Busy.

02:40.590 --> 02:41.959
- [Nicole] Busy good?

02:41.959 --> 02:43.420
- No, not so much.

02:43.420 --> 02:44.764
- Oh yeah?

02:48.380 --> 02:49.280
Well, I'm about ready.

02:49.280 --> 02:50.550
Then we can get going.

02:50.550 --> 02:52.210
- No, let's just stay in tonight.

02:52.210 --> 02:53.070
- It'll just take a second.

02:53.070 --> 02:53.903
I'm almost done.

02:53.903 --> 02:56.210
- No, it was a long day.

02:56.210 --> 02:57.510
We can eat here.

02:57.510 --> 02:58.410
- You sure?

02:58.410 --> 03:00.483
We haven't gone out in forever.

03:01.476 --> 03:02.309
- Yeah.

03:15.599 --> 03:19.451
(soft music)

03:19.451 --> 03:21.258
- What're you doing?

03:21.258 --> 03:22.970
- [Calvin] I'm gettin' dressed.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.671
- [Summer] I see that, why?

03:24.671 --> 03:26.151
- So I can get going.

03:26.151 --> 03:27.207
- You're leaving?

03:27.207 --> 03:29.348
- Yeah, it's late.

03:29.348 --> 03:32.530
- I know it's late, but
you don't have to leave.

03:32.530 --> 03:34.190
- Why would I stay?

03:34.190 --> 03:35.751
- Why? I don't know.

03:35.751 --> 03:38.090
Maybe because we just had sex.

03:38.090 --> 03:42.060
- Yeah, and now we're done and it's late.

03:42.060 --> 03:44.017
- Yeah, you said that already.

03:45.730 --> 03:47.890
- I have to wake up early for work.

03:47.890 --> 03:48.840
- So set an alarm.

03:48.840 --> 03:50.310
- I'm not staying the night.

03:50.310 --> 03:53.222
- So what, this is just
a one-night stand then?

03:53.222 --> 03:55.160
- Why're you getting upset?

03:55.160 --> 03:56.150
I start work early.

03:56.150 --> 03:57.620
I don't have any clothes here

03:57.620 --> 03:59.600
and there's gonna be
traffic in the morning.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.750
It makes no sense for
me to stay the night.

04:02.760 --> 04:03.850
- You didn't answer my question,

04:03.850 --> 04:06.210
so this is just a one-night stand then.

04:06.210 --> 04:08.330
- Well, originally no.

04:08.330 --> 04:10.140
But now, I'm thinking yes.

04:10.140 --> 04:12.280
- Yes?
- Look how you're acting.

04:12.280 --> 04:13.290
- How I'm acting?

04:13.290 --> 04:15.160
Maybe if you weren't such
a self-centered asshole,

04:15.160 --> 04:16.959
you would know that you don't
just have sex with somebody

04:16.959 --> 04:17.793
and leave.

04:19.230 --> 04:21.392
- Fine, you want me to stay?

04:22.970 --> 04:25.270
I can stay for like 15 more minutes,

04:25.270 --> 04:26.320
will that make you happy?

04:26.320 --> 04:28.160
- Just get the hell out.

04:28.160 --> 04:29.270
- I said I'd stay.

04:29.270 --> 04:30.560
- No, get out.

04:30.560 --> 04:32.483
- Fine, psycho.

04:33.652 --> 04:34.485
- Asshole.

04:40.696 --> 04:43.446
(birds chirping)

04:44.327 --> 04:47.244
(soft piano music)

04:52.062 --> 04:53.312
- [Willow] Hey.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.225
- I miss you.

05:05.218 --> 05:06.534
- Oh, Sam.

05:08.102 --> 05:11.269
(alarm clock beeping)

05:16.916 --> 05:19.666
(birds chirping)

05:28.470 --> 05:31.637
(soft music)

05:34.805 --> 05:37.800
- So it's my friend
Jessica's birthday tonight.

05:37.800 --> 05:38.633
Owen,

05:40.810 --> 05:42.482
are you listening?

05:42.482 --> 05:43.477
- Yes.

05:43.477 --> 05:45.600
- It's my friend Jessica's
birthday tonight.

05:45.600 --> 05:47.173
She asked me to go out with her.

05:50.720 --> 05:52.060
We're gonna be drinking, doing drugs,

05:52.060 --> 05:53.550
dancing with random men.

05:53.550 --> 05:54.720
At some point, we're
goin' to the strip club

05:54.720 --> 05:57.183
and I plan on dancing on stage naked.

05:58.320 --> 06:01.470
And if all goes well, I'll
probably go home with someone

06:01.470 --> 06:02.790
or multiple someones.

06:02.790 --> 06:03.831
Do you mind?

06:06.290 --> 06:07.978
Owen.

06:07.978 --> 06:09.137
- Yeah, what?

06:09.137 --> 06:10.211
- I asked you a question.

06:10.211 --> 06:13.372
- Yeah babe, whatever you want.

06:13.372 --> 06:14.955
I gotta go to work.

06:15.823 --> 06:16.656
Bye.

06:20.916 --> 06:25.916
(birds chirping)
(soft piano music)

06:28.084 --> 06:29.726
(door open)

06:54.546 --> 06:59.546
(playful light music)
(birds chirping)

07:02.508 --> 07:03.690
- Look at her, Cooper.

07:03.690 --> 07:05.230
- Yeah. (chuckles softly)

07:05.230 --> 07:07.630
- She's the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

07:09.350 --> 07:11.800
I think today's finally
the day I go talk to her.

07:15.850 --> 07:18.360
Yeah, yeah, I know I've
been saying that for weeks,

07:18.360 --> 07:21.151
but today's different.

07:22.010 --> 07:23.302
I can feel it.

07:28.047 --> 07:30.070
You know, on second thought,

07:30.070 --> 07:31.600
today really doesn't feel much different

07:31.600 --> 07:33.042
than every other day.

07:36.235 --> 07:37.504
Whatever.

07:37.504 --> 07:38.337
I'm just

07:39.717 --> 07:42.071
Just gonna do it.

07:42.071 --> 07:43.446
I'm gonna go talk to her.

07:44.456 --> 07:47.206
(birds chirping)

07:49.748 --> 07:51.241
What do I say?

07:52.690 --> 07:55.677
Hi, I like your face.

07:55.677 --> 07:58.878
Yeah, yeah, that'll work out great.

08:03.470 --> 08:08.183
Hey, I'm Theodore and I think
you're incredibly pretty.

08:09.060 --> 08:10.290
Since you started coming here,

08:10.290 --> 08:12.210
suddenly all the love songs are about you.

08:12.210 --> 08:13.495
Yeah, no.

08:16.065 --> 08:19.048
(sighs) Come on, think.

08:21.873 --> 08:23.431
What would Ed Sheeran say?

08:24.494 --> 08:27.244
(birds chirping)

08:28.510 --> 08:30.240
- I'm telling you, he loves that phone

08:30.240 --> 08:31.463
more than he loves me.

08:33.230 --> 08:34.770
The first thing he wakes
up to in the morning

08:34.770 --> 08:36.570
and the last thing he sees at night.

08:36.570 --> 08:39.780
If I didn't cook for him, he'd
probably forget I even exist.

08:39.780 --> 08:42.480
- Hey, knock that crap the F-off!

08:42.480 --> 08:44.660
I will beat you in public.

08:44.660 --> 08:46.018
- Is everything okay?

08:46.018 --> 08:48.030
- (sighs) Yeah, it's just Austin

08:48.030 --> 08:50.210
bein' a complete idiot like always.

08:50.210 --> 08:51.450
I swear when it comes to that kid,

08:51.450 --> 08:52.890
the bells are ringing, lights are flashing

08:52.890 --> 08:56.520
and the gates were down,
but the train isn't coming.

08:56.520 --> 08:58.250
Anyway, what were you saying?

08:58.250 --> 08:59.506
- I was telling you about Owen

08:59.506 --> 09:02.020
and how he gives his phone
more attention than he does me.

09:02.020 --> 09:04.462
- Right. You know what?
When your uncle ignores me,

09:04.462 --> 09:06.370
I just walk around the house naked

09:06.370 --> 09:08.410
or wear his favorite lingerie outfit,

09:08.410 --> 09:10.780
but mainly naked.

09:10.780 --> 09:12.340
- Thanks for the visual, Aunt Grace.

09:12.340 --> 09:14.349
I really needed that.

09:14.349 --> 09:15.560
- You know what your problem is?

09:15.560 --> 09:17.642
You dress like a schoolteacher

09:17.642 --> 09:20.200
and not in a good, dreamy, sexy way

09:20.200 --> 09:23.003
like a 1950's schoolteacher with tenure.

09:24.050 --> 09:24.960
- Thanks.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.060
- I'm being serious.

09:26.060 --> 09:27.850
You want his attention, don't you?

09:27.850 --> 09:28.683
- Yeah.

09:28.683 --> 09:31.271
- Well, you have to get
it from between his legs.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.640
- I will keep that in mind.

09:33.640 --> 09:36.600
- Dammit, this kid!

09:36.600 --> 09:38.450
If dumb were dirt, we wouldn't
have to come to the park

09:38.450 --> 09:39.960
for him to play outside.

09:39.960 --> 09:41.860
I'm gonna have to call you back later.

09:41.860 --> 09:42.693
- Bye.

09:43.534 --> 09:44.850
(children chattering)

09:44.850 --> 09:47.235
(fists smacking)

09:47.235 --> 09:49.985
(birds chirping)

09:51.105 --> 09:54.430
- Pick-up lines.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.090
Nope,

09:58.090 --> 09:59.430
nope.

09:59.430 --> 10:00.870
Too offensive.

10:00.870 --> 10:02.045
Too overused.

10:03.150 --> 10:03.983
Okay.

10:05.160 --> 10:06.947
Okay, I think I got one.

10:09.897 --> 10:11.488
(birds chirping)

10:13.530 --> 10:15.665
- Sorry about my dog.

10:15.665 --> 10:20.665
(playful light music)

10:21.370 --> 10:22.600
Okay,

10:22.600 --> 10:23.433
bye.

10:27.570 --> 10:28.770
- Oh, wait.

10:28.770 --> 10:30.030
I like your face.

10:31.955 --> 10:32.788
- Huh?

10:34.590 --> 10:38.998
- I, I mean uh, do you mind
filling out a quick survey?

10:40.360 --> 10:41.570
- I guess not.

10:41.570 --> 10:43.304
What's the survey for?

10:43.304 --> 10:44.588
- Uh, here.

10:46.855 --> 10:49.605
(birds chirping)

10:57.200 --> 10:58.366
- Here you go.

11:02.710 --> 11:05.220
Well, it was nice meeting you.

11:05.220 --> 11:08.523
- Yeah, it was nice to meet you too.

11:16.530 --> 11:17.771
You see that?

11:18.852 --> 11:20.101
I got her number.

11:21.981 --> 11:24.167
Yes! Yes!

11:26.251 --> 11:29.518
(both chuckling softly)

11:40.671 --> 11:43.838
(soft cheerful music)

11:54.467 --> 11:58.167
- "Happy birthday to mom and
dad's second favorite kid.

11:58.167 --> 12:01.007
"I bought you a cool gift,
but I decided to keep it.

12:01.007 --> 12:03.743
"Anyway, here's $25.

12:13.234 --> 12:14.067
(scribbling)

12:14.067 --> 12:15.925
"Here's $4.00

12:17.275 --> 12:18.967
"and 61 cents.

12:18.967 --> 12:22.050
"Don't say I never got you anything."

12:29.348 --> 12:32.098
(birds chirping)

12:40.880 --> 12:42.980
- [Lilly] Finn, they need you at my party.

12:43.830 --> 12:44.810
- What?

12:44.810 --> 12:48.580
- Notice how I said they,
mom and dad, not me.

12:48.580 --> 12:50.950
I can't open any presents without you.

12:50.950 --> 12:51.983
Now, come on.

12:56.653 --> 12:57.673
Come on.

12:58.620 --> 12:59.765
- I'm coming.

13:00.915 --> 13:05.915
(birds chirping)
(soft whimsical music)

13:23.500 --> 13:25.070
- Do you mind if I sit here?

13:32.730 --> 13:34.263
I'm Evie, by the way.

13:35.820 --> 13:36.653
- Sam.

13:36.653 --> 13:38.495
- Nice to meet you, Sam.

13:38.495 --> 13:41.360
(birds chirping)

13:41.360 --> 13:43.100
This is a nice view of the park.

13:43.100 --> 13:44.900
I can see why you like sitting here.

13:46.370 --> 13:48.753
Really puts things in perspective.

13:51.326 --> 13:52.525
It's kinda like those sayings.

13:52.525 --> 13:55.097
You know like, "If you give a fellow money

13:55.097 --> 13:58.340
"and you never see him again,
it was probably worth it."

13:58.340 --> 14:01.427
Or "If you think no one cares
if you're dead or alive,

14:01.427 --> 14:03.377
"just miss a few credit card payments."

14:05.070 --> 14:07.120
You know what always confused me?

14:07.120 --> 14:12.090
When somebody says, "I'm not
book smart, I'm street smart."

14:12.090 --> 14:14.287
Whenever anybody says that, all I hear is,

14:14.287 --> 14:17.827
"I'm not real smart, I'm imaginary smart."

14:20.095 --> 14:20.928
So

14:22.510 --> 14:24.843
What kinda sandwich is
that? It looks good.

14:29.010 --> 14:31.230
I'm sorry if I'm bothering you.

14:32.270 --> 14:35.592
I come to this park often and

14:35.592 --> 14:38.250
I always see you sitting here and you just

14:38.250 --> 14:40.579
you look so lonely.

14:40.579 --> 14:41.720
I just wanted to say hi.

14:42.561 --> 14:47.550
(somber piano music)
(birds chirping)

14:47.550 --> 14:49.137
I'll go, have a nice day.

14:50.340 --> 14:51.640
- Peanut butter and jelly.

14:54.120 --> 14:55.220
- Huh?

14:55.220 --> 14:58.430
- It's a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

14:58.430 --> 15:02.390
- Oh, love me some PB&J. (chuckles softly)

15:02.390 --> 15:04.860
- I have another half if you want it.

15:04.860 --> 15:07.797
- Yeah, if you don't mind.

15:07.797 --> 15:11.130
(soft whimsical music)

15:12.130 --> 15:13.540
Sam, I think this is the beginning

15:13.540 --> 15:15.560
of a beautiful friendship.

15:15.560 --> 15:17.260
- Not if you eat half
my sandwich every time,

15:17.260 --> 15:18.890
Humphrey Bogart.

15:18.890 --> 15:22.223
(Evie chuckling softly)

15:25.610 --> 15:29.295
- Sam, I think I should make
the sandwiches next time.

15:41.360 --> 15:42.968
- How was the date?

15:42.968 --> 15:45.510
You gonna meet up with her again?

15:45.510 --> 15:48.650
- She turned out to be a psycho, so no.

15:48.650 --> 15:49.550
- Really?

15:49.550 --> 15:51.931
I told you, you need to stop using Tinder.

15:51.931 --> 15:53.813
- It's the only app people are using.

15:53.813 --> 15:55.120
- What are you talking about?

15:55.120 --> 15:56.960
There's tons of apps.

15:56.960 --> 15:58.680
You know what you should try?

15:58.680 --> 16:01.140
This new blind dating app I heard about.

16:01.140 --> 16:04.510
- So what, it just sends you
out on a random blind date?

16:04.510 --> 16:05.660
- No.

16:05.660 --> 16:07.200
Well,

16:07.200 --> 16:08.720
maybe.

16:08.720 --> 16:10.890
You just talk to people without photos.

16:10.890 --> 16:13.772
You know, get to know them first.

16:13.772 --> 16:15.440
- Yeah, it sounds kinda corny.

16:15.440 --> 16:19.290
It also sounds like a great
way to get catfished or robbed.

16:19.290 --> 16:20.170
- Please.

16:20.170 --> 16:24.400
If anyone is gonna be catfished,
it's gonna be the girl.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.460
Have you not seen a mirror?

16:26.460 --> 16:28.273
- Remind me why we're friends again.

16:34.283 --> 16:35.510
- Can you believe that guy?

16:35.510 --> 16:37.390
As soon as he finished,
he was out the door.

16:37.390 --> 16:38.223
- Well, what'd you expect?

16:38.223 --> 16:40.430
You said you met him off Tinder, right?

16:40.430 --> 16:43.880
- Yeah, but this one seemed different.

16:43.880 --> 16:45.820
- Yeah, but they all seem different.

16:45.820 --> 16:47.220
Then you meet them in person and find out

16:47.220 --> 16:50.400
all they want is sex
with no strings attached.

16:50.400 --> 16:51.593
- I'm gonna die single.

16:53.390 --> 16:55.440
- Oh you should try this
blind date app I heard about.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.470
- Mm-mmm.
- Mm-hmm.

16:56.470 --> 16:58.210
- I'm done with online dating for a while.

16:58.210 --> 16:59.630
- No, this one's different though.

16:59.630 --> 17:01.290
- Oh, okay.

17:01.290 --> 17:03.840
- You don't upload any
photos or give out your name.

17:03.840 --> 17:05.530
That matches you based on compatibility

17:05.530 --> 17:07.670
and you just talk.

17:07.670 --> 17:10.220
- Sounds pretty corny, don't you think?

17:10.220 --> 17:11.740
- At least give it a try.

17:11.740 --> 17:12.869
What do you have to lose?

17:12.869 --> 17:15.599
It's not like men are breaking
down your door anyways.

17:15.599 --> 17:17.400
- Remind me why we're friends again.

17:19.700 --> 17:21.040
- The vic was looking at pornography

17:21.040 --> 17:23.290
when someone stabbed him in the eyes.

17:23.290 --> 17:28.290
- Looks like he went blind
from too much masturbation.

17:28.861 --> 17:32.194
(dark foreboding music)

17:39.620 --> 17:41.463
- Hey, it's me,

17:42.570 --> 17:43.690
Theodore.

17:43.690 --> 17:45.140
Just wanted to say what's up?

17:47.680 --> 17:49.170
Wait.

17:49.170 --> 17:50.788
I never told her my name.

17:54.270 --> 17:57.190
Hey, it's the guy you
met at the park today.

17:57.190 --> 17:59.400
The one who asked you
to fill out the survey,

17:59.400 --> 18:00.890
but it wasn't a survey.

18:00.890 --> 18:02.716
My name's Theodore by the way.

18:03.610 --> 18:06.980
Anyway, just wanted to say what's up?

18:06.980 --> 18:08.400
Ahhh.

18:08.400 --> 18:09.645
Way too long.

18:12.120 --> 18:14.220
Why do I keep putting what's up?

18:14.220 --> 18:15.763
Who says what's up anymore?

18:17.210 --> 18:18.093
Okay,

18:20.072 --> 18:20.905
just--

18:21.854 --> 18:23.167
just keep it simple.

18:25.530 --> 18:28.300
Hey Bailey, this is Theodore.

18:28.300 --> 18:30.410
I met you at the park today.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.560
Just wanted to say it
was nice meeting you.

18:42.814 --> 18:44.793
(cellphone chiming)

18:46.860 --> 18:50.167
- [Bailey] Hey, it was
nice meeting you too.

18:50.167 --> 18:53.280
- "It was nice meeting you too."

18:53.280 --> 18:54.113
Yes!

18:55.080 --> 18:56.733
Yes, yes.

18:58.240 --> 18:59.310
Okay.

18:59.310 --> 19:01.620
Okay, Theodore. (breathes heavily)

19:01.620 --> 19:02.453
Be cool.

19:07.900 --> 19:08.733
Hey.

19:11.200 --> 19:14.580
I know we just met and this
is probably way too soon, but

19:16.484 --> 19:17.909
do you wanna get married?

19:29.130 --> 19:30.980
Why's this so hard?

19:32.267 --> 19:35.267
(soft gentle music)

19:46.830 --> 19:48.630
- All right babe, Jessica's here.

19:48.630 --> 19:49.463
I'm leaving.

19:53.660 --> 19:54.850
- You're goin' out?

19:54.850 --> 19:56.543
- Yeah, with my friend Jessica.

19:58.190 --> 19:59.733
It's her birthday today.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.060
I told you this morning.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.730
- Right.

20:05.730 --> 20:06.770
What time are you comin' home?

20:06.770 --> 20:08.330
- I'm not sure.

20:08.330 --> 20:09.630
I wouldn't wait up though.

20:12.800 --> 20:13.633
- Nicole.

20:15.910 --> 20:19.374
Before you go, did you cook anything?

20:20.600 --> 20:22.250
- Yeah, it's in the oven.

20:22.250 --> 20:23.258
Just heat it up.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.617
- How was your day?

20:46.140 --> 20:47.815
- It's better now.

20:47.815 --> 20:48.748
- Is it?

20:53.330 --> 20:54.930
Come dance with me.

20:54.930 --> 20:56.070
- [Sam] There's no music.

20:56.070 --> 20:57.145
- Then play some.

20:58.040 --> 20:58.873
C'mon.

21:04.363 --> 21:06.773
("Elements" by Boheme)

- I guess I can always
delete it if anything.

23:16.040 --> 23:18.298
Summer, you need to
get your life together.

23:22.430 --> 23:23.263
Okay.

- Whoa, whoa.

23:38.272 --> 23:39.105
Sorry.

23:39.990 --> 23:41.533
I should've been there to catch you.

23:42.630 --> 23:43.560
I'm Jace, by the way.

23:43.560 --> 23:45.020
- Nicole.

23:45.020 --> 23:46.460
- You here with your boyfriend?

23:46.460 --> 23:48.450
- No, my girlfriend.

23:48.450 --> 23:50.340
It's her birthday.

23:50.340 --> 23:52.770
But looks like she
ditched me for some guys,

23:52.770 --> 23:54.590
so I'm calling a rideshare home.

23:54.590 --> 23:56.223
- Ooh, yeah.
- Yeah.

23:58.420 --> 24:00.080
(both sighing)

24:00.080 --> 24:00.913
Shucks.

24:02.930 --> 24:04.380
- What happened?

24:04.380 --> 24:05.790
- My driver just canceled.

24:05.790 --> 24:06.960
- What?

24:06.960 --> 24:08.330
No way, that sucks.

24:08.330 --> 24:09.163
- Yeah.

24:13.724 --> 24:15.835

24:26.877 --> 24:29.290

24:29.290 --> 24:31.260
Hey, did somebody order a four-door sedan

24:31.260 --> 24:32.923
with a five-star safety rating?

24:38.610 --> 24:43.070
And we are here, safe and sound.

24:43.070 --> 24:44.360
First time I've been able to say that

24:44.360 --> 24:46.080
since becoming a driver.

24:46.080 --> 24:47.090
- Thank you for the ride.

24:47.090 --> 24:48.130
- Mm-hmm.

24:48.130 --> 24:49.113
Hey, Nicole.

24:51.420 --> 24:53.123
You think I could take you out sometime?

24:54.237 --> 24:56.900
- I'd love to, but I have a boyfriend.

24:56.900 --> 25:00.240
- Oh well, I have a Facebook profile.

25:00.240 --> 25:01.073
- [Nicole] Okay.

25:01.990 --> 25:03.323
- Sorry, I just thought
we were talkin' about

25:03.323 --> 25:04.348
shit that doesn't matter.

25:04.348 --> 25:07.260
(Nicole chuckling softly)

25:07.260 --> 25:09.030
Well you have a good night, Nicole

25:09.030 --> 25:11.817
and try to not let the police
catch you on the way out.

25:11.817 --> 25:13.050
- The police?

25:13.050 --> 25:15.596
- Yeah, for stealing my heart
and running away with it.

25:15.596 --> 25:18.610
- (chuckles softly) You
have a good night too, Jace.

25:18.610 --> 25:19.443
- Goodnight.

25:39.404 --> 25:42.080
(soft piano music)

25:42.080 --> 25:42.913
- Not right now, Nicole.

25:42.913 --> 25:43.860
I'm watchin' something.

25:43.860 --> 25:46.074
- I just wanted a kiss.

25:46.074 --> 25:47.344
- Fine.

25:47.344 --> 25:48.920
(lips smacking)

25:50.004 --> 25:51.710
- I was gonna go have
lunch with a friend today,

25:51.710 --> 25:54.395
unless you wanted to
do something together.

25:54.395 --> 25:55.228
- No, it's fine.

25:55.228 --> 25:56.630
You can go.

25:56.630 --> 25:57.671
- Are you sure?

25:58.900 --> 26:00.011
It's your day off.

26:03.647 --> 26:04.563
I can cancel.

26:04.563 --> 26:05.730
I'm sure he won't mind.

26:05.730 --> 26:06.563
- He?

26:07.540 --> 26:09.843
- Yeah, my friend Jace.

26:09.843 --> 26:11.110
- [Owen] Have I met him?

26:11.110 --> 26:12.060
- I don't think so.

26:15.080 --> 26:16.893
He's tall, handsome.

26:20.030 --> 26:21.930
I met him last night outside the club.

26:23.620 --> 26:24.887
So should I cancel?

26:27.209 --> 26:28.361
- What?

26:28.361 --> 26:29.820
- Should I cancel with him?

26:29.820 --> 26:32.368
- No no no, it's fine. You can go.

26:32.368 --> 26:33.368
- Okay then.

26:35.030 --> 26:37.870
- [Calvin] Hey so according
to this site, we're a match.

26:37.870 --> 26:39.570
You describe yourself as female.

26:39.570 --> 26:41.254
Can you provide any proof?

26:41.254 --> 26:43.263
(soft upbeat music)

26:43.263 --> 26:44.295

26:45.900 --> 26:47.250

26:47.250 --> 26:49.185
how to sweep a lady off her feet.

26:49.185 --> 26:50.713
What kinda proof are you looking for?

26:50.713 --> 26:52.680
I'm pretty sure photos aren't allowed.

26:52.680 --> 26:54.170
I can mail you a cup of urine.

26:54.170 --> 26:55.107
Would that suffice?

26:55.107 --> 26:56.800
- [Calvin] Gross, no.

26:56.800 --> 26:58.290
I'm not your probation officer.

26:58.290 --> 26:59.550
You keep your urine.

26:59.550 --> 27:02.246
Hmm, let me think.

27:02.246 --> 27:03.733
Pop quiz?

27:03.733 --> 27:05.400
- [Summer] I'm game. First question.

27:07.266 --> 27:08.099
(typing)

27:09.040 --> 27:10.723
- [Calvin] What kinda shoes do you want?

27:12.787 --> 27:13.621
(typing)

27:13.621 --> 27:16.163
- [Summer] Sneakers, boots, sandals.

27:17.090 --> 27:18.210
- [Calvin] No heels?

27:18.210 --> 27:19.230
- [Summer] Maybe.

27:19.230 --> 27:20.063
Next question.

27:23.279 --> 27:25.916
- [Calvin] What kinda toys
did you play with as a kid?

27:27.210 --> 27:28.350
- [Summer] Stuffed animals.

27:28.350 --> 27:29.183
Next?

27:30.528 --> 27:32.987
- [Calvin] I can see
this is gonna get me far.

27:32.987 --> 27:34.480
- [Summer] Does that
mean you're giving up?

27:34.480 --> 27:36.143
I sit when I pee, if that helps.

27:37.110 --> 27:38.910
- [Calvin] You could
just have really bad aim.

27:38.910 --> 27:41.130
But it's the only helpful
answer you've given me so far,

27:41.130 --> 27:42.716
so thank you.

27:42.716 --> 27:43.750
- [Summer] You're welcome.

27:43.750 --> 27:45.408
So do I need to quiz you?

27:45.408 --> 27:46.610
(typing)

27:46.610 --> 27:49.295
It says you're male, but how to be sure?

27:52.690 --> 27:54.160
- [Calvin] I could
always mail you my urine.

27:54.160 --> 27:55.840
And if anything, save
it for when you go in

27:55.840 --> 27:57.231
for your weekly UA.

27:57.231 --> 27:59.060
Well hey, I have to get goin' to work.

27:59.060 --> 28:00.940
Talk later, yeah?

28:00.940 --> 28:03.140
- [Summer] 'Of course,
have a good day at work.

28:06.953 --> 28:10.120
(soft cheerful music)

28:17.815 --> 28:19.799
(glass tapping)

29:01.723 --> 29:03.282
(Nicole chuckling softly)

29:21.772 --> 29:24.247
(Nicole chuckling softly)

29:25.228 --> 29:26.878
(Nicole chuckling)

29:31.530 --> 29:32.530
- All right,

29:34.458 --> 29:35.375
there you go.

29:35.375 --> 29:37.123
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

29:37.123 --> 29:39.520
(soft upbeat music)
(birds chirping)

29:39.520 --> 29:41.130
Ooh, hold on.

29:41.130 --> 29:45.520
Before you cast those dreamy eyes on me,

29:45.520 --> 29:47.320
let me make sure I have the day free.

29:48.450 --> 29:49.863
Okay, go.

29:53.020 --> 29:54.380
So do you always look this pretty

29:54.380 --> 29:56.028
when you go to the bookstore?

29:56.028 --> 29:57.628
- I was tryin' to make
my boyfriend jealous.

29:57.628 --> 29:59.920
- Hmm, how's that workin' out?

29:59.920 --> 30:01.280
- Not so well.

30:01.280 --> 30:03.290
- Just a thought: If you're
tryin' to make him jealous,

30:03.290 --> 30:05.177
maybe don't tell him you're
goin' to the bookstore.

30:05.177 --> 30:07.698
- Yup, what would you have told him?

30:07.698 --> 30:09.616
- I don't know.

30:09.616 --> 30:12.150
Maybe that you're going on
a date with a handsome guy,

30:12.150 --> 30:13.127
like with me for instance.

30:13.127 --> 30:14.000
- Hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.120
- Thanks, I'll keep that
in mind for next time.

30:16.120 --> 30:17.995
- Glad I could help.

30:17.995 --> 30:20.280
You know, I am glad I ran into you.

30:20.280 --> 30:22.340
I was seriously considering
camping out on your block

30:22.340 --> 30:23.920
until you needed another rideshare.

30:23.920 --> 30:25.490
- That's not a bit stalkerish.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.370
- I was thinkin' more hopelessly romantic.

30:27.370 --> 30:30.010
Besides, detectives,
they do it all the time.

30:30.010 --> 30:33.371
- Maybe, but you're not
a detective now, are you?

30:33.371 --> 30:34.498
- Maybe I am.

30:34.498 --> 30:35.900
- You're a detective.

30:35.900 --> 30:38.670
- Me, a detective? (chuckles softly)

30:38.670 --> 30:40.402
Why, what have you heard?

30:40.402 --> 30:42.127
Who told you? I swear it wasn't like that.

30:42.127 --> 30:43.247
What did they say?

30:43.247 --> 30:44.890
(both chuckle softly)

30:44.890 --> 30:47.733
So what, you don't think you're worth it?

30:48.850 --> 30:49.960
- Worth what?

30:49.960 --> 30:51.370
- Worth some guy spending endless nights

30:51.370 --> 30:53.500
cramped in his car, peeing in bottles,

30:53.500 --> 30:56.330
showering in sprinklers,
shitting in mailboxes

30:56.330 --> 30:58.010
just hoping he'll get a
chance to see you again?

30:58.010 --> 30:59.849
- Shitting in mailboxes.
- Yeah.

30:59.849 --> 31:01.652
(Nicole chuckles softly)

31:01.652 --> 31:03.477
- I don't know.

31:03.477 --> 31:05.950
(birds chirping)
(soft upbeat music)

31:05.950 --> 31:06.783
- You are.

31:08.000 --> 31:08.833
Trust me.

31:17.498 --> 31:20.665
(soft cheerful music)

31:36.525 --> 31:39.858
(soft romantic music)

31:45.455 --> 31:46.870
- I had fun today.

31:46.870 --> 31:47.773
- I had fun too.

31:48.910 --> 31:50.210
Do I get to see you again?

31:52.320 --> 31:54.843
- I'd like that, but I have a boyfriend.

31:57.410 --> 31:58.243
- I know.

31:59.767 --> 32:03.240
You know if you were Christmas,

32:03.240 --> 32:04.963
I would be the Grinch who stole you.

32:06.377 --> 32:08.223
I don't think I'll ever
stop thinkin' about you,

32:08.223 --> 32:10.563
not tonight, not tomorrow,

32:11.960 --> 32:12.793
never.

32:15.928 --> 32:16.761
(cellphone ringing)

32:16.761 --> 32:17.594
Wait a moment.

32:24.808 --> 32:25.641
(cellphone beeps)

32:27.000 --> 32:28.390
Sorry about that.

32:31.859 --> 32:33.084
(lips smacking)

32:37.990 --> 32:39.590
- I'm sorry, that was a mistake.

32:47.005 --> 32:49.253
(door opens and closes)

32:49.253 --> 32:50.313
- Hey, babe.

32:53.538 --> 32:55.108
Something wrong?

32:55.108 --> 32:59.420
(somber orchestral music)

32:59.420 --> 33:01.460
- I gotta tell you something.

33:01.460 --> 33:02.293
- [Owen] Yeah?

33:05.660 --> 33:07.920
- Nevermind, it's nothing.

33:07.920 --> 33:09.090
I'm goin' to bed.

33:09.090 --> 33:11.396
- Nicole.
- Yeah?

33:11.396 --> 33:13.030
- Can you make me food first?

33:13.030 --> 33:14.880
- There's food in the fridge.

33:14.880 --> 33:16.050
Figure it out.

33:18.700 --> 33:23.100
- What crawled up her
ass? (chuckles softly)

33:29.389 --> 33:32.722
(soft upbeat music)

33:44.100 --> 33:45.560
- [Theodore] Good morning.

33:45.560 --> 33:47.288
Hope you have a good day

33:47.288 --> 33:50.090
and maybe I'll see you at the park later?

33:50.090 --> 33:51.165
Smiley face.

34:00.221 --> 34:03.217
(cellphone chiming)

34:03.217 --> 34:04.940
- [Bailey] Hey, good morning.

34:04.940 --> 34:06.210
Yeah, for sure.

34:06.210 --> 34:07.356
See you there.

34:13.884 --> 34:18.884
(soft whimsical music)
(birds chirping)

34:20.630 --> 34:22.097
- Hi.

34:22.097 --> 34:23.530
- Hi.

34:23.530 --> 34:25.330
- Don't tell me you made a sandwich.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.632
- Okay, I won't.

34:28.632 --> 34:30.310
- Well, did you?

34:30.310 --> 34:32.020
- Did I what?
- Make a sandwich.

34:32.020 --> 34:33.563
- You just told me not to tell you.

34:33.563 --> 34:35.896
- You know exactly what I mean.

34:35.896 --> 34:40.013
I told you next time I
would make the sandwiches.

34:44.871 --> 34:47.340
It's a good-looking sandwich, right?

34:47.340 --> 34:50.723
- Yes, by far the most attractive
sandwich I've ever seen.

34:51.603 --> 34:53.510
Do you think it's single?

34:53.510 --> 34:54.513
- Go on, try it.

34:57.200 --> 34:59.770
Way better than that crusty-old
sandwich you've been eating.

34:59.770 --> 35:01.470
- Crusty-old sandwich?

35:01.470 --> 35:02.303
Wow.

35:02.303 --> 35:04.150
- I'm just being honest.
- Wow.

35:08.160 --> 35:09.574
What'd you put in here?

35:09.574 --> 35:12.458
- Oh, it's just this
nut butter blend I made.

35:12.458 --> 35:15.183
It's almond butter, pine-nut butter,

35:15.183 --> 35:17.766
(Sam grunting)
cashew butter.

35:20.260 --> 35:21.137
Are you okay?

35:21.137 --> 35:22.337
- Did you say pine-nuts?

35:23.370 --> 35:24.510
- Yeah, why?

35:24.510 --> 35:26.197
- Yeah, I'm allergic to tree nuts.

35:26.197 --> 35:27.846
- You are? I had no idea.
- Yeah, yeah.

35:27.846 --> 35:28.740
- I thought with the P.B.--
- How's my face look?

35:28.740 --> 35:30.156
How's my face? Is it swellin' up?

35:30.156 --> 35:31.239
- No.
- Is it swellin' up? No?

35:31.239 --> 35:32.072
- You look fine,

35:32.072 --> 35:33.122
but should we go to the hospital?

35:33.122 --> 35:33.955
- All right quick, quick.

35:33.955 --> 35:34.788
My EpiPen, it's in here.

35:34.788 --> 35:35.621
It's in here, it's in here.
- Okay.

35:35.621 --> 35:36.454
- All right.

35:36.454 --> 35:37.846
C'mon, c'mon.

35:37.846 --> 35:39.255
- Um, I don't--

35:39.255 --> 35:41.469
I don't see it.

35:41.469 --> 35:42.469
Where is it?

35:44.620 --> 35:46.260
- I'm just kidding.

35:46.260 --> 35:47.100
- What?

35:47.100 --> 35:48.190
- I had to get you back somehow

35:48.190 --> 35:49.707
for callin' my sandwich crusty.

35:49.707 --> 35:50.627
- Jerk.

35:50.627 --> 35:55.365
(soft whimsical music)
(birds chirping)

35:55.365 --> 35:56.790
- Evie?

35:56.790 --> 35:57.898
- Yeah, Sam?

35:59.666 --> 36:02.066
- I think I'll let you make
the sandwiches from now on.

36:06.814 --> 36:09.981
(soft cheerful music)

36:20.749 --> 36:21.702
- Right here.

36:21.702 --> 36:22.706
Max.

36:22.706 --> 36:23.548
Yes.

36:23.548 --> 36:25.751
(gasps) Good boy.

36:25.751 --> 36:30.751
(soft playful music)
(birds chirping)

36:33.818 --> 36:35.151
- C'mon, Cooper.

36:37.210 --> 36:38.043
Hey.

36:40.104 --> 36:42.196
- (chuckles softly) Hi.

36:45.337 --> 36:46.887
So how's your day going?

36:48.230 --> 36:49.063
- Good.

36:53.050 --> 36:55.846
Oh and uh, what about yours?

36:56.740 --> 36:59.953
- It's great. (chuckles softly)

37:04.390 --> 37:06.803
Well, I'm going to get Max some exercise.

37:08.460 --> 37:09.735
It was nice seeing you.

37:11.363 --> 37:12.518
Come on, Max.

37:15.050 --> 37:16.010
- Yeah.

37:16.010 --> 37:17.273
Yeah, okay.

37:20.230 --> 37:21.699
Come on, Theodore.

37:21.699 --> 37:22.951
Get it together, man.

37:22.951 --> 37:25.501
You're blowin' it. (exhales)

37:26.898 --> 37:29.181
(Theodore breathes deeply)

37:33.007 --> 37:34.550
What?

37:34.550 --> 37:35.510
It's called a power pose.

37:35.510 --> 37:37.028
It gives you confidence.

37:38.890 --> 37:40.220
It works, okay?

37:42.280 --> 37:43.858
You're so judgemental.

37:46.020 --> 37:49.140
Okay, you got this.

37:49.140 --> 37:49.973
- Hey.

37:51.940 --> 37:53.680
- Hey.

37:53.680 --> 37:57.290
So um, sorry to bother you.

37:57.290 --> 38:00.450
Just wanted to see if you
have plans Friday night

38:01.880 --> 38:04.268
and if maybe you'd be hungry?

38:05.310 --> 38:06.433
- No plans.

38:07.357 --> 38:10.755
And yeah, I'm sure I'll be hungry by then.

38:11.650 --> 38:12.758
- Great.

38:13.972 --> 38:15.229
Um

38:15.229 --> 38:18.220
would you like to go with me

38:18.220 --> 38:19.195
to eat?

38:20.630 --> 38:21.660
- Sure.

38:21.660 --> 38:22.700
- Really?

38:22.700 --> 38:23.643
I mean, okay.

38:24.710 --> 38:25.543
Awesome.

38:27.011 --> 38:29.491
(soft upbeat music)

38:29.491 --> 38:31.416
(cellphone chiming)

38:35.760 --> 38:37.960
- [Calvin] Hey you, how was your day?

38:37.960 --> 38:39.140
- [Summer] I got away with speeding

38:39.140 --> 38:40.660
and several other misdemeanors.

38:40.660 --> 38:42.920
So on the whole, I'm satisfied.

38:42.920 --> 38:44.350
What about yours?

38:44.350 --> 38:46.670
- [Calvin] Mine was amazing.

38:46.670 --> 38:48.840
One of the worst days of my life.

38:48.840 --> 38:50.520
After two weeks of straight good days,

38:50.520 --> 38:51.770
I was ready for a change.

38:56.250 --> 38:58.570
- [Summer] Yeah, sounds
like you were overdue.

38:58.570 --> 39:00.270
Anything interesting happen today?

39:01.460 --> 39:02.991
- [Calvin] Define interesting.

39:04.690 --> 39:06.780
- [Summer] Interesting, adjective:

39:06.780 --> 39:08.960
arousing a feeling of interest.

39:11.160 --> 39:12.210
- [Calvin] Smart ass.

39:13.090 --> 39:15.970
Well I did discover the secret of life.

39:15.970 --> 39:16.960
- [Summer] Really?

39:16.960 --> 39:18.660
Do tell.

39:18.660 --> 39:21.502
- [Calvin] Tell you what:
10 bucks and it's all yours.

39:24.197 --> 39:26.300
- [Summer] $10, is that all?

39:29.030 --> 39:31.480
- [Calvin] Well if you
knew the secret of life,

39:31.480 --> 39:33.830
you wouldn't think it
was worth much either.

39:33.830 --> 39:35.700
- [Summer] In that case,
maybe I shouldn't know.

39:35.700 --> 39:37.850
I'll just stick to
thinking it's chocolate.

39:46.245 --> 39:48.412
- [Calvin] Should we meet?

39:53.017 --> 39:58.017
(birds chirping)
(soft light music)

40:05.045 --> 40:06.900
- You're not gonna make a sandwich?

40:06.900 --> 40:08.200
- Not today.

40:08.200 --> 40:09.700
- But you always pack a lunch.

40:11.250 --> 40:12.291
- Well,

40:13.700 --> 40:15.130
there's this girl.

40:15.130 --> 40:16.010
- There's a girl?

40:16.010 --> 40:17.460
- It's not like that.

40:17.460 --> 40:20.090
She's just someone that's
been coming to the park.

40:20.090 --> 40:21.233
- You like her.

40:22.297 --> 40:25.360
- I mean, I guess she's okay.

40:25.360 --> 40:26.193
- Just okay?

40:27.473 --> 40:28.730
- All right, fine.

40:28.730 --> 40:30.035
She's better than okay.

40:32.035 --> 40:32.868
But--

40:35.225 --> 40:36.183
- But?

40:41.958 --> 40:42.791
But

40:43.875 --> 40:45.191
she's not me.

40:47.313 --> 40:49.138
- No, she's not.

40:51.429 --> 40:52.495
- Sam,

40:56.114 --> 40:57.580
maybe it's time.

41:01.719 --> 41:04.332
(birds chirping)

41:04.332 --> 41:07.249
(soft light music)

41:33.790 --> 41:35.490
- Do you mind if I sit here?

41:37.546 --> 41:39.531
Uh--

41:39.531 --> 41:40.681
I'm a--

41:41.930 --> 41:44.380
I'm tryin' to make that
woman over there jealous.

41:47.860 --> 41:49.603
- That homeless woman sleeping?

41:51.319 --> 41:52.497
- Is she homeless?

41:52.497 --> 41:53.330
Uh--

41:54.550 --> 41:58.600
- [Penelope] Why on earth would
you wanna make her jealous?

41:58.600 --> 41:59.853
- She's actually my ex.

42:00.749 --> 42:02.770
- (chuckles softly) Your ex?

42:02.770 --> 42:03.603
- Yes.

42:04.484 --> 42:06.989
Since we broke up, life
has not been easy for her.

42:06.989 --> 42:08.432
- No, I'd say not.

42:11.813 --> 42:14.046
- So what shall we talk about?

42:14.046 --> 42:15.610
- Talk about?

42:15.610 --> 42:17.608
As in a conversation?

42:17.608 --> 42:19.440
I don't know about all that.

42:19.440 --> 42:21.980
I'm not even sure about you sitting here.

42:21.980 --> 42:23.640
Certainly wouldn't wanna
end up like your ex.

42:23.640 --> 42:25.907
- I certainly wouldn't want that either.

42:28.170 --> 42:30.260
The name's Finn, by the way.

42:30.260 --> 42:31.258
- Penelope.

42:31.258 --> 42:32.690
- Penelope.

42:32.690 --> 42:34.905
That's a nice name, it suits you.

42:36.130 --> 42:38.968
- Well Finn, it was lovely meeting you.

42:38.968 --> 42:39.847
- You're leavin' already?

42:39.847 --> 42:40.697
- [Penelope] Yes.

42:41.980 --> 42:43.578
- Oh.

42:43.578 --> 42:44.950
Uh--

42:44.950 --> 42:48.227
Would you hold this for
me while I walk with you?

42:50.412 --> 42:53.035
- (chuckles softly) Come along then.

42:55.361 --> 42:58.111
(birds chirping)

43:02.718 --> 43:05.635
(soft piano music)

43:10.988 --> 43:11.821
- Sam.

43:13.515 --> 43:14.348
Sam.

43:16.924 --> 43:18.360
I made sandwiches again.

43:20.080 --> 43:21.953
- I don't think I can do this anymore.

43:23.007 --> 43:25.450
- But you don't have to
eat it, we can just sit.

43:25.450 --> 43:27.253
- No, it's not the sandwiches.

43:28.110 --> 43:29.950
I'm talking about this.

43:29.950 --> 43:30.937
I can't do this.

43:30.937 --> 43:33.000
- What exactly is this?

43:33.000 --> 43:34.030
- This.

43:34.030 --> 43:36.707
You and me sittin' together
every day like we're--

43:38.229 --> 43:39.713
- Like we're what?

43:39.713 --> 43:42.080
- Like we're friends.

43:42.080 --> 43:43.823
And we both know you and me,

43:45.080 --> 43:46.593
we can't be friends.

43:46.593 --> 43:49.004
- (scoffs) And why not?

43:49.004 --> 43:51.150
- Because eventually it's
gonna lead to something more.

43:51.150 --> 43:54.252
- I see, so you're afraid
that this might lead to more

43:54.252 --> 43:56.352
and you don't wanna take that chance?

43:58.970 --> 44:00.250
Am I so bad?

44:03.880 --> 44:05.931
You know what? I was
just tryin' to be nice.

44:05.931 --> 44:08.080
So whatever, Sam.

44:08.080 --> 44:09.247
I'll leave you alone.

44:11.170 --> 44:12.003
- Evie.

44:17.200 --> 44:21.360
- So you live in London,
you fly home tomorrow

44:21.360 --> 44:23.310
and you're just tellin' me this?

44:23.310 --> 44:24.700
- When would I have told you?

44:24.700 --> 44:26.260
We only just met.

44:26.260 --> 44:27.093
- Just my luck.

44:27.093 --> 44:29.980
I meet this girl, we have this
connection and she's leavin'.

44:29.980 --> 44:30.813
- Connection?

44:30.813 --> 44:33.213
(soft light music)

44:33.213 --> 44:34.480
- Yeah.

44:34.480 --> 44:36.996
Wait, you're tellin' me you don't feel it?

44:38.770 --> 44:41.371
Like on a scale of one to
10, what would you say?

44:41.371 --> 44:43.290
(Penelope chuckling softly)

44:43.290 --> 44:46.113
I'm guessing by your face, a three?

44:48.090 --> 44:51.490
Okay, not what I was expecting.

44:51.490 --> 44:52.323
A two?

44:55.630 --> 44:58.588
Really, a one.
(Penelope chuckling)

44:58.588 --> 44:59.838
A one outta 10.

45:02.243 --> 45:03.284
- A zero.

45:05.710 --> 45:08.070
- Thank you for leaning
in while you said that.

45:08.070 --> 45:11.235
I could feel the cold breeze
comin' off your icy heart.

45:11.235 --> 45:12.710
(Penelope chuckling softly)

45:12.710 --> 45:15.040
You know, the problem with you leavin'

45:15.040 --> 45:16.412
is that today's laundry day.

45:16.412 --> 45:18.650
(Penelope chuckling)
All my outfits are clean.

45:18.650 --> 45:21.659
We have a date tomorrow,
a lotta possibilities.

45:21.659 --> 45:23.120
(Penelope chuckling softly)

45:23.120 --> 45:25.513
So what all have you
done since you been here?

45:26.930 --> 45:28.530
- Mainly just studying.

45:28.530 --> 45:29.363
- Studying.

45:29.363 --> 45:31.640
- Yes, I'm here on student visa.

45:31.640 --> 45:33.030
- You've been here for like three months

45:33.030 --> 45:34.830
and all you've been doing is studying?

45:34.830 --> 45:37.711
- Yes, I've been proper busy
with exams and school work,

45:37.711 --> 45:38.853
I'll have you know.

45:38.853 --> 45:40.834
Something I'm sure you know little of.

45:40.834 --> 45:41.667
(Finn chuckles softly)

45:42.880 --> 45:46.303
- No, we have to change that right now.

45:47.970 --> 45:49.170
C'mon.

45:49.170 --> 45:50.650
- Where are we going?

45:50.650 --> 45:51.733
- You'll see.

45:54.380 --> 45:55.213
Trust me.

46:04.236 --> 46:09.236
(people chattering)
(soft playful music)

46:15.010 --> 46:16.227
- Hi, ready to order?

46:18.111 --> 46:19.490
- Uh--

46:19.490 --> 46:20.898
I'll have what she's having.

46:20.898 --> 46:21.902
(Theodore chuckles)

46:21.902 --> 46:22.735
(waiter scoffs)

46:23.840 --> 46:25.893
- I'll have the seafood and rice soup.

46:28.067 --> 46:29.960
- Did, did you say seafood?

46:29.960 --> 46:31.442
- Yeah, why?

46:31.442 --> 46:34.262
- Actually, can-- can I get my menu back?

46:38.190 --> 46:39.906
I'ma-- I'm allergic to fish.

46:46.070 --> 46:47.213
- I can come back.

46:50.020 --> 46:52.918
- I'll have a-- the
lemon chicken rice soup.

46:58.617 --> 47:00.849

49:06.950 --> 49:07.783
- It's good.

49:09.150 --> 49:09.983
Yours?

49:11.160 --> 49:11.993
- It's good.

49:12.880 --> 49:16.322
Yeah, very lemony.

49:16.322 --> 49:17.280
(Bailey chuckles softly)

49:17.280 --> 49:18.593
Plus there's rice.

49:19.550 --> 49:20.840
Rice is good when you're really hungry

49:20.840 --> 49:23.268
and want 1,000 of something.

49:23.268 --> 49:25.793
(Bailey chuckling)

49:38.727 --> 49:41.477
Would you excuse me for a minute?

49:44.743 --> 49:47.501
(water trickling)
(Theodore grunting)

49:47.501 --> 49:48.914
Get it together, man.

50:08.141 --> 50:13.141
(soft romantic music)
(people chattering)

50:15.430 --> 50:16.263
So Bailey,

50:17.269 --> 50:18.102
uh--

50:18.102 --> 50:20.283
talk nerdy to me.

50:22.347 --> 50:24.968
What is the ugliest vegetable?

50:24.968 --> 50:26.240
- Um,

50:26.240 --> 50:29.870
I don't think there's such
thing as an ugly vegetable.

50:29.870 --> 50:33.800
But if I had to choose,
I'd say kale on principle.

50:33.800 --> 50:34.933
Because kale.

50:35.930 --> 50:37.410
- You're telling me.

50:37.410 --> 50:39.857
Ever since kale, I've had
to sleep with the lights on.

50:39.857 --> 50:41.148
(Bailey chuckles softly)

50:41.148 --> 50:45.434
And although not ugly, I
don't much like onions either.

50:45.434 --> 50:47.070
- Onions, why?

50:47.070 --> 50:48.290
- They make me sad

50:48.290 --> 50:50.657
and not a lotta people
seem to realize that.

50:50.657 --> 50:53.550
- Any other vegetables
I should know about?

50:53.550 --> 50:55.775
- Nope, just the two.

50:59.670 --> 51:01.953
So Bailey,

51:03.460 --> 51:05.060
maybe you can help me with this.

51:06.510 --> 51:09.014
At what age should I
tell Cooper he's adopted?

51:09.014 --> 51:11.413
- (chuckles softly) That's a tough one.

51:12.670 --> 51:15.610
If you told him now, how do
you think he would take it?

51:15.610 --> 51:17.480
- Well if he takes it as well

51:17.480 --> 51:19.633
as when I tell him in a minute, then good.

51:21.155 --> 51:22.488
- In a minute?

51:22.488 --> 51:23.557
- Yeah.

51:23.557 --> 51:26.180
You know, in a minute?

51:26.180 --> 51:27.467
Like when he's beggin' for something

51:27.467 --> 51:29.610
and I say, "In a minute, Cooper."

51:29.610 --> 51:31.901
But what I really mean is please forget.

51:31.901 --> 51:33.884
And he does, every time.

51:35.035 --> 51:35.868
You uh--

51:35.868 --> 51:38.490
You don't do that with Max?

51:38.490 --> 51:39.540
- [Bailey] Sometimes.

51:40.450 --> 51:42.550
- I found it also works on small children.

51:43.575 --> 51:46.492
(Bailey chuckling)

51:51.484 --> 51:55.190
(soft piano music)

51:55.190 --> 51:56.023
- This is me.

51:57.970 --> 51:59.461
I had fun today.

51:59.461 --> 52:01.410
You're quite the tour guide.

52:01.410 --> 52:02.243
- Right?

52:03.130 --> 52:04.700
Subtract the survival skills,

52:04.700 --> 52:07.510
historical significance and boobs,

52:07.510 --> 52:09.370
I'm basically Sacagawea.

52:15.420 --> 52:16.678
- What's the matter?

52:18.430 --> 52:20.603
- Am I ever gonna see you again?

52:24.210 --> 52:25.337
- Finn.

52:25.337 --> 52:27.130
- (sighs) I'm sorry,

52:27.130 --> 52:29.230
I'm ruinin' the night and I don't mean to.

52:30.730 --> 52:32.040
- Gimme your phone.

52:40.810 --> 52:43.840
There, now you have my number.

52:43.840 --> 52:46.280
If you're ever in London, call me.

52:46.280 --> 52:51.153
- So are you gonna kiss me or
do I have to lie to my diary?

52:57.319 --> 52:58.819
- Goodnight, Finn.

53:00.140 --> 53:01.821
- Goodnight, Penelope.

53:06.626 --> 53:08.640
(lips smacking)

53:08.640 --> 53:11.086
- Seriously though, call me.

53:12.250 --> 53:13.320
- I will.

53:13.320 --> 53:14.403
- You better.

53:24.241 --> 53:27.365
(Finn sighing)

53:27.365 --> 53:32.365
(soft guitar music)
(crickets chirping)

53:42.720 --> 53:44.750
- I had fun tonight.

53:44.750 --> 53:46.743
- Tonight was fun, wasn't it?

53:50.360 --> 53:52.560
- Oh.
- Oh, sorry.

53:52.560 --> 53:53.393
(Bailey chuckles)

54:01.067 --> 54:02.091
(bushes rustling)

54:02.091 --> 54:03.258
What was that?

54:05.736 --> 54:10.011
(cat hissing)
(Theodore shrieking)

54:12.574 --> 54:14.955
- (chuckles) You're afraid of cats?

54:14.955 --> 54:16.790
- Cats?

54:16.790 --> 54:18.810
Oh, look at that.

54:18.810 --> 54:22.870
A really nonthreatening house cat.

54:22.870 --> 54:24.617
Well, I'm gonna get goin'.

54:28.260 --> 54:29.570
Call you later?

54:29.570 --> 54:31.190
- [Bailey] Yeah, I'd like that.

54:31.190 --> 54:33.240
- Okay, bye.

54:33.240 --> 54:34.073
- Bye.

54:44.095 --> 54:45.997
(children chattering)

54:45.997 --> 54:48.260
- Austin, get your
finger out of your nose.

54:48.260 --> 54:51.320
No, don't eat it! (scoffs)

54:51.320 --> 54:53.170
Oh, I can't deal with this kid today.

54:57.680 --> 55:00.230
Hey, have you seen a bottle
of pills in your kitchen?

55:00.230 --> 55:01.063
- Pills?

55:01.063 --> 55:01.896
- Yeah, I hid them there,

55:01.896 --> 55:04.070
so that your uncle wouldn't find them.

55:04.070 --> 55:05.650
No, wait a minute. I
know where they're at.

55:05.650 --> 55:07.292
I hid them in Austin's room.

55:08.710 --> 55:10.030
What?

55:10.030 --> 55:11.053
I'm joking.

55:12.330 --> 55:13.523
Relax.

55:14.925 --> 55:16.240
Okay fine, they're in there.

55:16.240 --> 55:18.862
But come on, we're talking Austin here.

55:18.862 --> 55:20.230
You think he can open up a pill bottle

55:20.230 --> 55:21.830
with that safety thing on it?

55:21.830 --> 55:23.580
That kid can't even open up a book.

55:29.900 --> 55:31.443
- I kissed him.

55:31.443 --> 55:33.780
- Who are we talkin' about exactly?

55:33.780 --> 55:34.998
- Jace.

55:34.998 --> 55:36.590
I met him on Jessica's birthday

55:37.830 --> 55:40.230
and then we ended up spending
the whole day together

55:40.230 --> 55:41.070
and I kissed him.

55:41.070 --> 55:42.840
- Is he cute?

55:42.840 --> 55:44.370
Did you tell Owen?

55:44.370 --> 55:46.770
- Yes, he's cute.

55:46.770 --> 55:47.930
And I was gonna tell Owen,

55:47.930 --> 55:51.711
but he never listens to me, ever.

55:52.700 --> 55:54.761
So what would even be the point?

55:56.087 --> 56:00.471
I don't know, I just feel
so alone when I'm with Owen.

56:01.360 --> 56:02.373
But Jace,

56:04.850 --> 56:06.090
he makes me feel wanted.

56:06.090 --> 56:07.690
- Listen, I wasn't gonna tell you this

56:07.690 --> 56:09.400
'cause I know how much you like Owen.

56:09.400 --> 56:11.550
But maybe it's time you let that frog

56:11.550 --> 56:13.040
hop on back to the swamp.

56:13.040 --> 56:17.060
- But I love him and I
don't wanna hurt him.

56:17.060 --> 56:19.370
- Well something's gotta change,

56:19.370 --> 56:21.413
unless you wanna be miserable forever.

56:24.136 --> 56:25.679
(Nicole sighing)

56:27.455 --> 56:28.930
- We've been talkin' for a few weeks.

56:28.930 --> 56:30.590
How is it too soon?

56:30.590 --> 56:32.340
- You don't even know what he looks like.

56:32.340 --> 56:34.705
I mean, what if he turns
out to be a total creep?

56:34.705 --> 56:36.710
- Well if he does, I'll have you to thank.

56:36.710 --> 56:37.760
- [Vanessa] Me?

56:37.760 --> 56:40.450
- Yes, you. You were the
one that told me to sign up.

56:40.450 --> 56:43.143
- Well I didn't think you were
gonna go and fall in love.

56:43.143 --> 56:44.220
- Please, I'm not in love.

56:44.220 --> 56:45.320
We just barely met.

56:45.320 --> 56:48.865
- Summer, I know you and I
know when you're in love.

56:48.865 --> 56:51.507
- Obviously not, because I'm not in love.

56:51.507 --> 56:52.856
- [Vanessa] If you say so.

56:52.856 --> 56:53.897
- I'm not.

56:55.840 --> 56:58.220
- Okay, well call me
after your date tomorrow

56:58.220 --> 56:59.630
so I know you're safe.

56:59.630 --> 57:00.804
- Okay, mom.

57:00.804 --> 57:02.340
- I'm being serious.

57:02.340 --> 57:04.770
If I don't hear from
you, I'll call the cops.

57:04.770 --> 57:05.765
You know I will.

57:05.765 --> 57:07.260
- [Summer] I'll call.

57:07.260 --> 57:08.720
- You better.

57:08.720 --> 57:11.112
Okay. Love you, bye.

57:11.112 --> 57:11.945
- Bye.

57:13.981 --> 57:15.575
Pfft, I'm not in love.

57:24.223 --> 57:25.357
(Summer chuckling softly)

57:26.740 --> 57:28.780
- You actually signed up for it?

57:28.780 --> 57:30.860
- What do you mean you actually signed up?

57:30.860 --> 57:31.930
You told me to.

57:31.930 --> 57:34.153
- Yeah, but I didn't think you'd do it.

57:35.200 --> 57:37.230
- Yeah well, I did

57:38.355 --> 57:39.821
and I met one person.

57:40.860 --> 57:42.490
- That's it?

57:42.490 --> 57:44.210
Only one?

57:44.210 --> 57:45.780
I thought you don't use photos.

57:45.780 --> 57:47.906
Did you describe yourself in the bio?

57:47.906 --> 57:49.733
- (chuckles sarcastically) Funny.

57:51.010 --> 57:53.530
I don't think a lotta people use it.

57:53.530 --> 57:54.640
- It's the city.

57:54.640 --> 57:56.580
Of course a lot of people use it.

57:56.580 --> 57:59.810
- Fine, millions of people
use it and I have one match.

57:59.810 --> 58:01.140
You happy?

58:01.140 --> 58:03.423
Remind me again of all of the triumphs

58:03.423 --> 58:05.040
you've had in your dating life.

58:06.563 --> 58:07.712
- Ouch.

58:07.712 --> 58:08.671
(Mason chuckles softly)

58:08.671 --> 58:10.373
Well, how is she?

58:11.830 --> 58:12.663
- I like her.

58:13.640 --> 58:14.800
- Yeah?

58:14.800 --> 58:16.563
- Yeah, I really do.

58:17.730 --> 58:22.730
She's smart and she's bit of a smart ass.

58:22.830 --> 58:24.530
- Do you know what she looks like?

58:26.250 --> 58:27.610
- No idea.

58:27.610 --> 58:30.100
- What are you gonna do
if you're being catfished?

58:30.100 --> 58:31.280
- Really?

58:31.280 --> 58:33.021
- What? It could happen.

58:33.021 --> 58:34.000
- Yeah, I know.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.960
I said that to you when
you told me to sign up.

58:36.960 --> 58:37.860
- You did?

58:37.860 --> 58:40.850
- Yeah and you blew it
off like it was a joke.

58:40.850 --> 58:44.813
- Well, I'm sure she looks fine.

58:46.400 --> 58:49.150
But have her send a photo just in case.

58:49.150 --> 58:50.150
- There's no point.

58:51.360 --> 58:53.860
I'm meeting her in person tomorrow.

58:53.860 --> 58:55.150
- Nice.

58:55.150 --> 58:57.060
Can I come with?

58:57.060 --> 58:57.893
What?

58:57.893 --> 58:59.648
In case she's not what you expected.

59:04.841 --> 59:05.674
- Fine.

59:06.807 --> 59:09.724
(soft piano music)

59:14.398 --> 59:15.515
- What's wrong?

59:17.400 --> 59:18.233
- Nothing.

59:20.220 --> 59:21.650
- Sam, I know you.

59:23.260 --> 59:24.650
- It's just--

59:24.650 --> 59:26.120
- It's just?

59:28.060 --> 59:29.093
- I don't know.

59:29.973 --> 59:31.519
- Sam, tell me.

59:35.815 --> 59:37.273
- I don't wanna lose you.

59:37.273 --> 59:39.600
- You're not gonna lose me.

59:39.600 --> 59:40.433
- No?

59:42.008 --> 59:44.080
How would I not?

59:44.080 --> 59:45.175
Don't you get it?

59:46.910 --> 59:50.020
You live here in my heart.

59:50.020 --> 59:52.025
Willow, all of this is yours.

59:53.320 --> 59:55.395
If I let anyone else in, it'd be like

59:57.700 --> 59:59.155
like I'm replacing you

01:00:00.552 --> 01:00:02.990
and I can't do that to you.

01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:04.998
I can't. I love you too much.

01:00:07.310 --> 01:00:10.343
- Sam, I'll always be with you.

01:00:10.343 --> 01:00:11.176
- Yeah.

01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:13.653
What do you know?

01:00:15.422 --> 01:00:17.041
You're not even real.

01:00:17.041 --> 01:00:19.958
(soft piano music)

01:00:26.053 --> 01:00:29.136
(Sam weeping softly)

01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:37.587
- So what are we lookin' for?

01:00:37.587 --> 01:00:42.023
- Female, late 20s sitting
alone in a red dress.

01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:44.019
- Do you think that's her?

01:00:44.019 --> 01:00:47.019
(people chattering)

01:00:47.995 --> 01:00:49.860
What is your deal, man?

01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:52.130
- Remember that terrible
date I told you about,

01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:52.963
the Tinder one?

01:00:52.963 --> 01:00:54.930
- Weren't all of your
Tinder dates terrible?

01:00:54.930 --> 01:00:56.355
- The most recent one.

01:00:56.355 --> 01:00:58.610
- Oh yeah, I remember.

01:00:58.610 --> 01:01:00.197
- That's the girl.

01:01:00.197 --> 01:01:01.570
- What?

01:01:01.570 --> 01:01:02.423
No way.

01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.458
Oh, she is cute.

01:01:05.458 --> 01:01:06.939
You think that's your blind date?

01:01:06.939 --> 01:01:09.270
- Do you see anyone else
sitting alone in a red dress?

01:01:10.975 --> 01:01:12.511
- Nope, just her.

01:01:13.850 --> 01:01:14.683
Maybe she's running late.

01:01:14.683 --> 01:01:15.516
Message her.

01:01:20.468 --> 01:01:21.585
- Sent.

01:01:21.585 --> 01:01:23.760
Is she checkin' her phone?

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:24.655
- Oh yeah.

01:01:24.655 --> 01:01:26.130
And I think she's messaging you back.

01:01:26.130 --> 01:01:28.220
(cellphone chiming)

01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:29.880
What'd she say?

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:30.713
- It's her.

01:01:32.091 --> 01:01:35.317
- Oh man, what are you gonna do?

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:43.510
- Sent.

01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:44.650
Come on.

01:01:44.650 --> 01:01:45.991
- Wait, what?

01:01:48.192 --> 01:01:49.790
(cellphone chiming)

01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:51.050
- [Calvin] You're going to hate me.

01:01:51.050 --> 01:01:53.403
Something came up and I can't make it.

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:55.823
Rain check?

01:01:59.377 --> 01:02:02.377
(soft guitar music)

01:02:05.615 --> 01:02:07.781
(Owen chuckling softly)

01:02:11.323 --> 01:02:12.156
- Owen.

01:02:14.244 --> 01:02:15.257
Owen.

01:02:15.257 --> 01:02:16.573
- What?

01:02:16.573 --> 01:02:17.757
Hey, what're you doing?

01:02:17.757 --> 01:02:20.130
- You're always on this damn phone.

01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:22.680
You never give me any attention
anymore and I'm tired of it.

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:24.688
- You're exaggerating.
I'm not always on it.

01:02:24.688 --> 01:02:25.740
- Yes, you are.

01:02:28.003 --> 01:02:30.807
I want you to choose,
either this phone or me.

01:02:30.807 --> 01:02:31.845
- (chuckles) What?

01:02:31.845 --> 01:02:33.203
That's ridiculous.

01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:35.803
I'm not going to choose.

01:02:35.803 --> 01:02:37.030
What is this about?

01:02:37.030 --> 01:02:38.755
Is this because we don't go out?

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:40.840
Fine, we'll go out.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:41.752
- I said choose.

01:02:41.752 --> 01:02:43.324
- And I said I'm not going to.

01:02:43.324 --> 01:02:44.925
Now gimme back my damn phone.

01:02:46.408 --> 01:02:48.011
You're acting crazy right now.

01:02:50.357 --> 01:02:52.110
Fine, you want me to choose?

01:02:53.587 --> 01:02:55.463
All right, I choose you.

01:02:56.454 --> 01:02:57.721
Now can I have my phone?

01:02:59.863 --> 01:03:01.328
I'll put it away.

01:03:01.328 --> 01:03:02.700
I need it for work.

01:03:12.674 --> 01:03:15.424
(birds chirping)

01:03:18.910 --> 01:03:21.130
- I thought you said
you were only visiting.

01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:23.470
Why are you selling all your stuff?

01:03:23.470 --> 01:03:26.550
- I am, but I kinda need
money to get there and back.

01:03:26.550 --> 01:03:28.290
Unless you wanna let me borrow some?

01:03:28.290 --> 01:03:30.190
- Absolutely not.

01:03:30.190 --> 01:03:32.730
Do mom and dad know that
you're going to London?

01:03:32.730 --> 01:03:35.152
- Lilly please, I'm an adult.

01:03:35.152 --> 01:03:36.510
They don't have to know.

01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:41.360
- On the outside, technically
yes, you're an adult.

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:44.238
But up here, we're talking preschool.

01:03:44.238 --> 01:03:48.070
(birds chirping)
(soft whimsical music)

01:03:48.070 --> 01:03:49.220
- Is that car for sale?

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:53.433
- No.

01:03:55.855 --> 01:03:57.150
- I'll give you three grand for it.

01:03:57.150 --> 01:03:59.155
- No, man, I'm still
makin' payments on it.

01:03:59.155 --> 01:04:00.143
- I got cash.

01:04:01.490 --> 01:04:02.323
- Sold.

01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:04.433
- Case in point.

01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:06.393
- Shut up.

01:04:07.781 --> 01:04:11.420
- (scoffs) Mm-mmm.

01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:12.923
This place is a disaster.

01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:20.105
Nasty, Summer.

01:04:20.105 --> 01:04:21.009
- Whatever.

01:04:21.009 --> 01:04:22.750
- You need to forget about this guy.

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:26.044
How long has it been since you last spoke?

01:04:26.044 --> 01:04:27.150
- A week.

01:04:27.150 --> 01:04:30.290
- A week and no response,
it is time to move on.

01:04:30.290 --> 01:04:32.010
He's obviously not interested.

01:04:32.010 --> 01:04:33.460
- Maybe something happened to him.

01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:38.073
- Yeah, or maybe he came
to the restaurant and saw--

01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:40.953
- Saw what?

01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:44.796
Go on, say what you're gonna say.

01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:48.520
- Maybe he saw you and
you're not his type.

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:51.170
I don't like seeing you like this.

01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:53.060
Summer, you need to forget about this guy.

01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:54.540
It is for your own good!

01:04:55.559 --> 01:04:56.392
(door slamming)

01:04:56.392 --> 01:04:57.978
(Vanessa scoffing)

01:04:57.978 --> 01:04:59.980
(birds chirping)

01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:01.130
- Could we slow down?

01:05:04.281 --> 01:05:09.281
(breathes heavily) What's your deal today?

01:05:09.830 --> 01:05:10.830
- Nothin'.

01:05:10.830 --> 01:05:13.280
- No, why are you tryin'
to gimme a heart attack?

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:17.500
It's that girl, isn't it?

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:18.890
- Could we talk about somethin' else,

01:05:18.890 --> 01:05:21.360
like maybe how are you so outta shape?

01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:24.700
- No no no, don't turn this around on me.

01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:26.430
Have you messaged her
since the restaurant?

01:05:26.430 --> 01:05:27.360
- Drop it.

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:29.560
- You haven't, have you?

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:31.298
- I said drop it, okay?

01:05:32.850 --> 01:05:34.890
- I thought you liked her.

01:05:34.890 --> 01:05:36.670
- Message her and say what?

01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:38.270
Like hey, I know we clicked on here.

01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:41.460
But remember that one-night
stand you had a few weeks ago

01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:42.890
and the guy wanted to leave

01:05:42.890 --> 01:05:44.340
because he had work in the morning

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:47.600
and then you totally lost your shit?

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:50.040
Well that guy was me, Calvin.

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:52.061
- I wouldn't send that exact message.

01:05:52.061 --> 01:05:53.470
- I'm not messaging her.

01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:55.223
- I thought we were resting.

01:05:56.980 --> 01:06:00.460
- The silicone in her breast
implants are what killed her.

01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:02.200
- Looks like those party boobs

01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:06.157
were a party foul.

01:06:06.157 --> 01:06:09.490
(dark foreboding music)

01:06:12.770 --> 01:06:13.730
- [Theodore] Quick, quick.

01:06:13.730 --> 01:06:15.070
Romance movie or horror?

01:06:15.070 --> 01:06:16.840
Romance or horror?

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:20.100
- [Bailey] Umm, romance. Ha ha.

01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:23.506
- [Theodore] Modern or
classic, modern or classic?

01:06:23.506 --> 01:06:25.730
- [Bailey] Classic of course.

01:06:25.730 --> 01:06:27.350
- [Theodore] Pizza or burgers?

01:06:27.350 --> 01:06:28.390
Quick.

01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:31.253
- [Bailey] Hmm, pizza.

01:06:32.250 --> 01:06:33.250
- [Theodore] Thanks.

01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:41.268
(cellphone chiming)

01:06:42.301 --> 01:06:44.810
- [Bailey] Are you gonna tell
me what that was all about?

01:06:44.810 --> 01:06:47.770
- [Theodore] Dinner and
a movie, your place.

01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:48.710
Tomorrow at eight.

01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:50.546
You in or are you out?

01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:55.813
- [Bailey] Smiley face, I'm in.

01:07:03.554 --> 01:07:06.471
(soft piano music)

01:07:13.994 --> 01:07:16.518
(door opens and closes)

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:23.753
- I'm ready, let's go.

01:07:25.865 --> 01:07:27.910
- Not tonight, I'm tired.

01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:28.870
- Really?

01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:30.880
You said we were going out, Owen.

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:33.060
I got all ready and everything again.

01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:36.390
- And we will just not tonight, Nicole.

01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:37.517
- And what about your phone?

01:07:37.517 --> 01:07:38.860
- What about it?

01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:40.610
- You said you'd stay off it.

01:07:40.610 --> 01:07:42.470
- I really just wanna relax right now.

01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:43.920
Can we talk about this later?

01:07:54.538 --> 01:07:56.738
(door clicking)

01:08:07.106 --> 01:08:10.523
(intriguing piano music)

01:08:18.435 --> 01:08:20.676
- So what do you think?

01:08:21.635 --> 01:08:23.518
Should we move in?

01:08:23.518 --> 01:08:24.966
- Sam, what are you up to?

01:08:24.966 --> 01:08:27.006
- I'm just askin' if we should move in

01:08:28.477 --> 01:08:30.889
because it's kind of ours.

01:08:30.889 --> 01:08:32.029
- You didn't.

01:08:32.029 --> 01:08:33.162
Get over here.

01:08:34.959 --> 01:08:37.036
I can't believe you
bought a house without me.

01:08:37.036 --> 01:08:38.823
You're lucky I like it.

01:08:43.312 --> 01:08:45.702
Sam.
- Yeah?

01:08:45.702 --> 01:08:47.140
- Something doesn't feel right.

01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:48.023
- Willow.

01:08:48.023 --> 01:08:49.220
What's wrong?

01:08:49.220 --> 01:08:51.113
Willow, Willow, Willow.

01:08:51.113 --> 01:08:53.038
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, Willow.

01:08:53.038 --> 01:08:54.652
Willow, Willow!

01:08:54.652 --> 01:08:56.501
C'mon, wake up, wake up, wake up.

01:08:56.501 --> 01:08:57.334
Willow!

01:08:59.481 --> 01:09:00.997
C'mon, c'mon. No no no, c'mon.

01:09:03.029 --> 01:09:08.029
(present thudding)
(intriguing piano music)

01:09:33.808 --> 01:09:36.560
(soft piano music)

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:38.100
- [Willow] Hey, Sam.

01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:40.010
Remember this photo?

01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:41.790
Our first date.

01:09:41.790 --> 01:09:43.770
That was a good day.

01:09:43.770 --> 01:09:46.630
I want you to always
remember me like that.

01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:50.567
Not like this, got it?

01:09:50.567 --> 01:09:52.279
I said do you got it?

01:09:52.279 --> 01:09:54.600
- Yeah, I got it.

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:58.220
- Now this next request
isn't going to be easy,

01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:00.000
but you're gonna have to do it

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.580
no matter how much you don't want to;

01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:03.413
for me.

01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:07.773
I need you to let yourself
fall in love again.

01:10:07.773 --> 01:10:09.850
You're the love of my life

01:10:09.850 --> 01:10:12.983
and I can't let you spend the
rest of your life heartbroken.

01:10:21.675 --> 01:10:22.508
Sam.

01:10:24.686 --> 01:10:26.877
(somber piano music)

01:10:26.877 --> 01:10:30.458
I will always cherish
the time we had together,

01:10:30.458 --> 01:10:33.142
but it's time for the next
chapter of your story.

01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:38.503
So until we meet again
one day, I love you.

01:10:40.146 --> 01:10:43.660
(sniffles) Try to stay outta trouble.

01:10:50.862 --> 01:10:52.446
- I love you too.

01:11:02.989 --> 01:11:05.856
(soft guitar music)

01:11:13.631 --> 01:11:14.464
- Owen.

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:16.418
- Hey, where's my coffee?

01:11:16.418 --> 01:11:17.501
I gotta go soon.

01:11:21.123 --> 01:11:22.114
- Owen.

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.285
- What?

01:11:29.710 --> 01:11:31.127
- I think we need a break.

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:34.813
Did you hear me?

01:11:36.407 --> 01:11:38.148
I said I think we need a break.

01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:40.620
Owen.

01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:42.503
- Yeah, whatever you say.

01:11:42.503 --> 01:11:43.687
I'm gonna be late.

01:11:45.661 --> 01:11:47.224
I'll see you later.

01:11:56.208 --> 01:11:59.208
(soft guitar music)

01:12:01.183 --> 01:12:03.005
(cellphone chiming)

01:12:04.997 --> 01:12:06.780
- [Summer] Hey stranger,
just wanted to say

01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:08.920
that I know what happened
and I understand.

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:10.100
You came to the restaurant,

01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:11.890
you didn't like what you saw and left.

01:12:11.890 --> 01:12:15.390
I get it. I probably would've
done the same and I'm not mad.

01:12:19.979 --> 01:12:22.087
(cellphone chiming)

01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:26.050
- [Calvin] If you're
tryin' to say I saw you

01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:28.870
and I think you're ugly,
you couldn't be more wrong.

01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:30.870
It's you that'll be disappointed.

01:12:33.862 --> 01:12:35.350
(cellphone chiming)

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:36.183
- [Summer] Excuse me,

01:12:36.183 --> 01:12:39.186
I'll be the judge of whether
or not I'm disappointed

01:12:39.186 --> 01:12:41.636
and you still owe me a
rain check, remember?

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:44.590
- Yes, I remember.

01:12:44.590 --> 01:12:45.903
Your place in an hour?

01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:49.140
- But you don't know where I live.

01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:51.110
- [Calvin] Oh, yeah.

01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:53.890
I guess I'll just have to knock
on every door in the city.

01:12:53.890 --> 01:12:55.570
This could take a while.

01:12:55.570 --> 01:12:56.770
Maybe make it two hours?

01:12:58.020 --> 01:12:59.050
- [Summer] Or I could make it easy,

01:12:59.050 --> 01:13:01.905
we could just meet at the
park, the one on Jefferson.

01:13:04.350 --> 01:13:06.790
- [Calvin] Okay, I'll
message you when I get there.

01:13:06.790 --> 01:13:09.920
Oh and if you turn out
to be a creepy stalker,

01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:11.033
I have pepper spray.

01:13:13.940 --> 01:13:15.260
- [Summer] Thanks for the warning.

01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:17.210
I'll make sure to catch you off-guard.

01:13:18.210 --> 01:13:19.293
See you soon.

01:13:25.470 --> 01:13:27.250
- You're getting on that plane.

01:13:27.250 --> 01:13:30.640
- No Dick, I don't wanna go.

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:32.130
What about last night?

01:13:32.130 --> 01:13:33.360
- Last night you were all dolled-up

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:34.500
in that push-up contraption

01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:36.640
that makes your As look like Cs.

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:38.225
I was goofy on giggle juice.

01:13:38.225 --> 01:13:39.320
I would've just said damn near anything

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:41.244
to play the horizontal polo.

01:13:41.244 --> 01:13:43.870
- You're just saying that
because you want me to go.

01:13:43.870 --> 01:13:45.995
- I'm saying it because it's true.

01:13:45.995 --> 01:13:48.367
Deep down inside, we both
know you belong on that plane

01:13:48.367 --> 01:13:51.160
with that other guy, whatever his name is.

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.460
If you'd stay, it won't end well.

01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:57.020
We'll end up married,
children, hating each other.

01:13:57.020 --> 01:13:57.853
You'll get fat

01:13:57.853 --> 01:14:00.140
and I'll end up cheating
on you three times a week.

01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:01.580
- I don't believe you.

01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:03.970
- Just believe that if you
don't get on that plane,

01:14:03.970 --> 01:14:04.960
you're going to regret it.

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:05.793
- No!

01:14:05.793 --> 01:14:07.470
- Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow.

01:14:07.470 --> 01:14:09.210
But one day when you're washing my clothes

01:14:09.210 --> 01:14:12.320
and you find women's panties
balled up in my pocket

01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:14.219
and for the rest of your life.

01:14:14.219 --> 01:14:16.550
- But I said that I would never leave you.

01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:18.810
- Dammit woman, can't
you see that our problems

01:14:18.810 --> 01:14:20.573
won't amount to a hill of garbanzo beans

01:14:20.573 --> 01:14:21.923
in this crazy world?

01:14:23.952 --> 01:14:25.223
Now, now.

01:14:26.730 --> 01:14:28.080
Here's lookin' at you, kid.

01:14:29.451 --> 01:14:33.002
(plane propeller whirring)

01:14:33.002 --> 01:14:35.919
(soft light music)

01:14:42.606 --> 01:14:44.548
- Oh, thanks.

01:14:44.548 --> 01:14:45.823
(Theodore chuckles nervously)

01:14:51.981 --> 01:14:54.680
- You know when I said classic,

01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:57.070
I was thinking a little less classic.

01:14:57.070 --> 01:14:58.910
- How less?

01:14:58.910 --> 01:15:01.486
- Early 2000s, maybe late 90s.

01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:03.820
- I'm offended.

01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:05.220
You call those classics?

01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:06.053
- Yes.

01:15:07.118 --> 01:15:09.377
- (sighs) Millennials.

01:15:09.377 --> 01:15:11.732
- (chuckles) Aren't you a millennial too?

01:15:11.732 --> 01:15:14.480
(Theodore gasping)

01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:15.313
- Am I?

01:15:17.974 --> 01:15:20.230
You're right, I am.

01:15:20.230 --> 01:15:22.253
Quick, I need a distraction.

01:15:23.707 --> 01:15:25.840
Do you wanna see a magic trick?

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:26.673
- Sure.

01:15:26.673 --> 01:15:28.360
- Here, gimme your hands.

01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:31.277
(soft light music)

01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:38.505
Isn't this magical?

01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:21.100
- Maybe we should go to my room.

01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:22.350
- What, really?

01:16:25.143 --> 01:16:27.460
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:29.656
Yeah, okay.

01:16:29.656 --> 01:16:30.689
Let's go.

01:16:31.633 --> 01:16:34.076
(Theodore grunting)
(Bailey gasping)

01:16:34.935 --> 01:16:36.123
Little help here.

01:16:37.066 --> 01:16:38.829
(Bailey chuckling softly)

01:16:38.829 --> 01:16:41.829
(crickets chirping)

01:16:50.742 --> 01:16:53.860
(soft orchestral music)

01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:54.693
- Hey.

01:16:56.470 --> 01:16:57.303
- Oh,

01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:59.383
it's you.

01:17:00.643 --> 01:17:02.745
Um, I'm actually meeting someone, so.

01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:04.793
- I know.

01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:07.320
- You know?

01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:08.173
- Yes.

01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:11.322
I'm the one you're meeting.

01:17:11.322 --> 01:17:14.239
(soft light music)

01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:18.740
I'm sorry about the other
day at the restaurant.

01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:20.653
I was there.

01:17:22.030 --> 01:17:23.580
But when I realized it was you,

01:17:24.930 --> 01:17:26.240
you

01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:27.670
looked

01:17:27.670 --> 01:17:29.983
beautiful by the way;

01:17:31.692 --> 01:17:32.525
I--

01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:35.340
I just knew you'd be let down,

01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:37.840
so I left.

01:17:40.290 --> 01:17:41.431
I'm sorry.

01:17:41.431 --> 01:17:42.616
This was stupid.

01:17:43.590 --> 01:17:45.040
It's just that you--

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:47.299
you said, "I didn't like what I saw,"

01:17:49.150 --> 01:17:50.950
and I wanted you to know that I did.

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:53.033
I really

01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:55.810
liked what I saw.

01:17:55.810 --> 01:17:59.143
(soft orchestral music)

01:18:01.743 --> 01:18:03.076
Goodbye, Summer.

01:18:04.410 --> 01:18:06.120
I hope I didn't ruin your night.

01:18:10.450 --> 01:18:11.283
- Hey.

01:18:14.810 --> 01:18:16.060
You were wrong.

01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:21.463
- About?

01:18:22.610 --> 01:18:24.077
- Me being disappointed.

01:18:45.132 --> 01:18:46.957
(lips smacking)

01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:57.547
(soft orchestral music)

01:19:03.428 --> 01:19:06.730
- [Nicole] Owen, I've been
so lonely for so long.

01:19:06.730 --> 01:19:09.100
We haven't had a real conversation in ages

01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:11.190
and I can't even remember the
last time you looked at me

01:19:11.190 --> 01:19:12.960
when I talked to you.

01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:14.980
I hope you find happiness.

01:19:14.980 --> 01:19:16.450
Maybe you already have.

01:19:16.450 --> 01:19:19.290
Your phone seems to make you
smile more than I ever did.

01:19:19.290 --> 01:19:22.360
But it can't be with me, not anymore.

01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:27.197
I hope you understand and know
that I will always love you.

01:19:28.045 --> 01:19:31.495
(soft orchestral music)

01:19:31.495 --> 01:19:32.328
- Nicole?

01:20:13.408 --> 01:20:15.161
- Um--

01:20:15.161 --> 01:20:16.911
Just gimme one sec.

01:20:47.192 --> 01:20:52.192
(crickets chirping)
(soft guitar music)

01:21:11.827 --> 01:21:13.610
You don't work tomorrow?

01:21:13.610 --> 01:21:14.443
- I do.

01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:22.859
(plane whooshing)

01:21:22.859 --> 01:21:25.859
(cellphone buzzing)

01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:29.943
- Hello?

01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:32.343
Finn?

01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:35.023
You're here?

01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:37.923
Yeah, yeah I know where it is.

01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:40.938
Okay, I'll see you soon.

01:21:46.394 --> 01:21:51.394
(soft light music)
(birds chirping)

01:21:51.916 --> 01:21:53.530
- Hey, how's your day going?

01:21:54.683 --> 01:21:57.283
- Do you know if this car has
a five-star safety rating?

01:21:58.130 --> 01:21:59.105
- Nicole?

01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:02.317
- You would not believe
how many rideshares

01:22:02.317 --> 01:22:03.990
I've had to take to find you.

01:22:05.410 --> 01:22:06.390
Hey.

01:22:06.390 --> 01:22:07.223
- Hey.

01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:10.113
So where am I taking you?

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:13.573
- I was hoping you'd tell me.

01:22:18.514 --> 01:22:23.514
(birds chirping)
(soft piano music)

01:22:29.928 --> 01:22:31.816
- [Sam] Do you mind if I sit with you?

01:22:32.682 --> 01:22:34.815
- It's a public park, so I guess not.

01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:49.103
- Look, I'm sorry about the other day.

01:22:55.630 --> 01:22:57.822
My wife passed away a couple years ago.

01:22:59.767 --> 01:23:02.873
And ever since then,

01:23:06.750 --> 01:23:08.225
well it hasn't been easy.

01:23:10.298 --> 01:23:14.433
And when you came around, I wasn't ready.

01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:21.163
But I am now.

01:23:26.312 --> 01:23:28.325
- I'm sorry, Sam.

01:23:28.325 --> 01:23:29.158
- Yeah.

01:23:34.036 --> 01:23:35.146
That's okay.

01:23:35.146 --> 01:23:36.400
I packed a lunch today.

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:38.750
- Yeah and we've both had
the lunch you've packed.

01:23:52.917 --> 01:23:57.917

(Penelope chuckling softly)

01:24:15.190 --> 01:24:17.280
- I got you these.

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:18.497
- They're lovely.

01:24:19.930 --> 01:24:21.960
I was afraid you wouldn't call.

01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:23.320
- Please.

(Penelope chuckling softly)

01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:36.960
I'm just glad you answered
and you're still single.

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:37.980
On the plane, I realized

01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:39.943
I probably shoulda told you I was coming.

01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:43.239
You are still single, right?

01:24:43.239 --> 01:24:44.239
(Penelope chuckling softly)

01:24:44.239 --> 01:24:46.230
- Finn, it's only been a week.

01:24:46.230 --> 01:24:47.877
- I know.

01:24:47.877 --> 01:24:49.870
Have you not seen yourself?

01:24:49.870 --> 01:24:51.140
I don't remember my dreams,

01:24:51.140 --> 01:24:54.132
but I assume you've been in
all of them since we met.

01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:58.990
- Would you stop talking
and kiss me already?
