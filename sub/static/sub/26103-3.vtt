00:01.020 --> 00:02.939
- Edward?
- Yeah.

00:02.940 --> 00:04.299
Good work.

00:04.300 --> 00:07.099
If you're proud of what you do,
it doesn't matter what they think.

00:07.100 --> 00:08.379
Are you proud?

00:08.380 --> 00:09.579
It's good.

00:09.580 --> 00:10.859
It's not good enough.

00:10.860 --> 00:12.379
We need to take some risks.

00:12.380 --> 00:14.299
Are you sleeping with other women?

00:14.300 --> 00:17.899
Foreign Secretary in
five minutes, Prime Minister.

00:17.900 --> 00:20.579
You try to make the rent.
If you don't, I kick you out.

00:20.580 --> 00:23.019
- She's wasted where she is.
- Don't even think about it.

00:23.020 --> 00:24.220
I know, but I am.

00:43.500 --> 00:44.740
Hello?

00:45.026 --> 00:46.386
Now?

00:48.833 --> 00:50.633
I'm on my way.

00:59.380 --> 01:01.710
It's all on my phone. News Feed.

01:01.711 --> 01:04.099
News feeds narrow your world view.

01:04.099 --> 01:06.619
They work out what you like,
and they give you more of that.

01:06.620 --> 01:08.099
Buy a paper, it's better for you.

01:08.100 --> 01:10.331
Have you always wanted
to do that then? Edit?

01:10.332 --> 01:13.339
When I was seven,
our class made a newspaper,

01:13.340 --> 01:14.859
put photos in, wrote stories.

01:14.860 --> 01:16.859
Front page was about stopping bullying.

01:16.860 --> 01:19.099
Head teacher was so impressed,
he made copies

01:19.100 --> 01:20.369
and sent it to all the parents.

01:20.370 --> 01:22.179
So yeah, since then.

01:22.180 --> 01:24.059
Well, you're a determined lady.

01:24.060 --> 01:27.460
Indeed. And on that note,
can we go any faster?

01:29.060 --> 01:30.539
How did you get here so quickly?

01:30.540 --> 01:32.059
Night bus and running.

01:32.060 --> 01:34.139
They said Chris was in trouble.

01:34.140 --> 01:36.979
He's in Dinsoor in Somalia.
We got the call 20 minutes ago.

01:36.980 --> 01:39.019
- From his mobile?
- Yeah.

01:42.540 --> 01:45.139
- Call the embassy.
- Hang on, wait.

01:45.140 --> 01:46.739
What's he doing out there?

01:46.740 --> 01:49.219
He had a contact in
one of the rebel armed groups.

01:49.220 --> 01:51.179
He's been out there for the last week.

01:51.180 --> 01:52.527
That's standard Arabic.

01:52.528 --> 01:55.819
People don't speak standard Arabic
in real life, only in films.

01:55.820 --> 01:57.019
That's a TV.

02:00.980 --> 02:03.607
He must have hit it by accident,
rolled onto it.

02:04.140 --> 02:06.620
Well, at least someone's
getting some sleep.

02:07.900 --> 02:10.900
I'm so sorry. Can...
Can we get you a car back?

02:11.358 --> 02:13.110
No, no. I'm in now.

02:13.111 --> 02:14.180
It's fine.

02:14.786 --> 02:16.058
But Holly?

02:16.059 --> 02:17.740
Yep? You go home.

02:20.300 --> 02:22.620
Can I just show you this?

02:24.380 --> 02:27.619
I mean, obviously it's just a start,
but there's something about it.

02:27.620 --> 02:29.500
- Joshua West?
- Yeah.

02:30.010 --> 02:32.111
- Do you believe it?
- No.

02:32.136 --> 02:34.379
He must get accusations
like this every week.

02:34.380 --> 02:35.714
Exactly.

02:35.715 --> 02:37.594
Even if there was any chance it was true,

02:37.595 --> 02:40.379
running a story against a popular
and benevolent billionaire

02:40.380 --> 02:43.819
with a thousand times the resources
we have for lawyers, research,

02:43.820 --> 02:45.219
to sustain a court battle,

02:45.220 --> 02:47.659
in our current state,
with how little we have,

02:47.660 --> 02:49.660
it'd be pretty much impossible.

02:51.700 --> 02:53.020
Look into it.

03:33.177 --> 03:41.189
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

04:19.420 --> 04:22.659
Rachel Gilmour. She claims that she
had a sexual relationship with West

04:22.660 --> 04:24.059
when she was 18.

04:24.060 --> 04:26.459
She met him on one of his
apprenticeship projects

04:26.460 --> 04:28.142
that he runs for
disadvantaged young people.

04:28.649 --> 04:32.099
He made advances, she said she
felt compelled to sleep with him

04:32.100 --> 04:33.939
because of his position of authority.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.805
So, why did she come to you?

04:35.806 --> 04:38.859
She read some of my work years ago
and thought I was still a reporter,

04:38.860 --> 04:40.059
felt she could trust me.

04:40.060 --> 04:43.979
But I told her I'd been promoted
and I'd get my best man on it.

04:43.980 --> 04:45.579
Sadly he's not available so...

04:45.580 --> 04:47.179
So she's expecting your call, yeah?

04:47.180 --> 04:49.161
Joshua West.

04:49.162 --> 04:50.339
Really?

04:50.340 --> 04:52.020
Well, these days, who knows?

04:52.501 --> 04:53.701
Yeah.

04:53.726 --> 04:56.779
Leona! You're supposed to be
on a train to Warwick!

04:56.780 --> 04:58.419
Oh, no problem!

04:58.420 --> 05:00.245
We've got facts, we want background.

05:00.246 --> 05:01.780
Ahead of the internet for once.

05:04.867 --> 05:06.147
Conference!

05:06.513 --> 05:08.033
The Post. What's that?

05:08.206 --> 05:09.406
Nothing.

05:10.820 --> 05:13.124
An iPad. I'm sending it
back, it's a present.

05:13.149 --> 05:14.183
From who?

05:14.184 --> 05:16.379
It really doesn't matter.

05:16.380 --> 05:17.659
Please get this right.

05:17.660 --> 05:20.180
I'd do it myself if I wasn't
handcuffed to a desk.

05:20.546 --> 05:22.226
- Of course.
- Thanks.

05:23.620 --> 05:25.580
Craig, can you send that for me?

05:25.933 --> 05:27.213
Thanks.

05:32.100 --> 05:33.500
Excuse me.

05:43.460 --> 05:45.140
I need stuff to pitch. Anything?

05:46.040 --> 05:47.080
Um..

05:49.500 --> 05:51.099
Joshua West?

05:51.100 --> 05:52.459
What about him?

05:52.460 --> 05:54.699
He might have a secret, in the past.

05:54.700 --> 05:57.419
Hm, what makes you think that?

05:57.420 --> 05:58.699
I've just got a feeling.

05:58.700 --> 06:01.140
Have you got a source,
or are you literally guessing?

06:02.980 --> 06:04.379
Don't worry about it.

06:04.380 --> 06:07.420
Boss is a fan of Joshua West,
they play poker together.

06:08.540 --> 06:09.710
Anything else?

06:09.711 --> 06:12.300
Have fun in Warwick,
get ahead of the police.

06:13.700 --> 06:14.940
OK.

06:19.620 --> 06:20.700
What?

06:28.300 --> 06:31.299
I've never met a journalist before.

06:31.300 --> 06:34.499
One of Brian's friends,
he worked on the crossword I think,

06:34.500 --> 06:37.184
but that's not really the same is it?

06:37.185 --> 06:41.059
We were worried. Well, you hear
about the press exploiting people.

06:41.060 --> 06:42.962
We don't exploit people.

06:42.963 --> 06:44.339
No.

06:44.340 --> 06:46.221
- You...
- Our editor is very clear,

06:46.246 --> 06:48.540
and she wouldn't allow it.

06:48.880 --> 06:50.240
Right.

06:51.500 --> 06:52.615
Well.

06:55.526 --> 06:57.166
I'll just be over there.

06:57.191 --> 06:58.351
Thanks, Mum.

07:01.740 --> 07:03.619
OK, um, do you mind if I...

07:03.620 --> 07:06.740
It's just so I can get an accurate
record of what was said.

07:07.860 --> 07:09.779
Er, so Rachel, here's what I know.

07:09.780 --> 07:12.539
You were on one of
the apprentice schemes,

07:12.540 --> 07:14.830
run by Joshua West's
charity, Forethought.

07:14.855 --> 07:15.875
That's right.

07:15.876 --> 07:18.180
- And you were 18?
- Yeah.

07:18.613 --> 07:20.773
OK. Tell me what happened.

07:36.660 --> 07:38.100
Ooh, that looks posh.

07:40.184 --> 07:41.742
It's for the opera, isn't it?

07:41.743 --> 07:43.059
I'm sorry? What? No, it's...

07:43.060 --> 07:45.539
You're on the board of six charities,

07:45.540 --> 07:48.259
and advise government policy
on various groups,

07:48.260 --> 07:50.499
yet the only organisation
you're involved with

07:50.500 --> 07:53.219
that would send you a gold
invitation is the opera.

07:53.220 --> 07:54.981
- Whatever it is...
- God, I hate opera.

07:55.006 --> 07:56.019
As you've said.

07:56.020 --> 07:58.552
- Like theatre without the ideas...
- OK.

07:58.553 --> 08:01.317
...or the acting. Expensive, privileged,

08:01.342 --> 08:03.899
and not even in a language
anyone can understand.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.106
What do they want?

08:05.107 --> 08:07.903
The artistic director's having a
reception and would like me there.

08:07.904 --> 08:10.151
To drink champagne.
That's a good use of arts subsidy.

08:10.152 --> 08:12.739
I don't have to justify
my interest in it to you.

08:12.740 --> 08:14.860
I know you don't,
but I'd love to hear it.

08:16.260 --> 08:19.019
Um, this school group were in
the other day.

08:19.020 --> 08:21.939
And, at the beginning, you couldn't
hear the music for the chat,

08:21.940 --> 08:24.860
the phone calls,
but by the end, they were silent.

08:25.176 --> 08:26.579
It blew their minds.

08:26.580 --> 08:28.099
It's the same with me.

08:28.100 --> 08:31.139
I mean, I didn't have any access
to opera growing up.

08:31.140 --> 08:34.298
I only started listening to it
five years ago when my...

08:35.025 --> 08:38.099
Anyway, and I don't know exactly how,

08:38.100 --> 08:40.299
but it has made the world richer.

08:40.299 --> 08:42.249
- Richer?
- Yeah.

08:42.250 --> 08:44.339
- OK.
- Anyway, I am on the board

08:44.340 --> 08:46.739
actually because I want
more people to have access.

08:46.740 --> 08:50.459
I want to bring the prices down, fix
the things you're complaining about.

08:50.460 --> 08:52.619
- You're going to go, aren't you?
- I think I will.

08:52.620 --> 08:53.652
Wear a nice dress... Yep.

08:53.677 --> 08:55.499
- ...enjoy the food...
- Exactly.

08:55.500 --> 08:58.219
Do you want to come with me?
You might learn something.

08:58.220 --> 09:00.340
I would rather eat my own leg.

09:05.220 --> 09:06.899
I'd not done brilliantly at school.

09:06.900 --> 09:09.979
But then I got onto this
training scheme for young people,

09:09.980 --> 09:11.699
validated by Joshua West.

09:11.700 --> 09:16.019
I was halfway through, and one day
Josh himself is there to do a talk.

09:16.020 --> 09:17.420
Drinks afterwards.

09:18.380 --> 09:23.099
There's a tap on my shoulder,
and he's in front of me.

09:23.100 --> 09:25.420
At the end of the event,
he gets a message to me,

09:25.421 --> 09:27.779
that he'd found what I said interesting,

09:27.780 --> 09:29.459
and he'd like to have dinner with me.

09:29.460 --> 09:31.380
It wasn't phrased as a question.

09:31.759 --> 09:33.279
It was a fact.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.179
It was at a restaurant in a hotel.

09:37.180 --> 09:39.300
- So he could...
- He'd booked a room?

09:39.693 --> 09:41.053
A suite.

09:41.980 --> 09:44.939
He asked if I wanted
to have dessert upstairs.

09:44.940 --> 09:46.879
But you knew what he wanted?

09:46.880 --> 09:50.699
Yeah, but I assumed it couldn't be that,

09:50.700 --> 09:52.580
because he has this amazing wife.

09:53.820 --> 09:55.580
I was this geeky girl.

09:55.987 --> 09:58.140
18, but I looked younger.

09:59.380 --> 10:01.740
And so, what happened when you went up?

10:05.660 --> 10:07.100
I was really drunk.

10:08.580 --> 10:10.220
He asked if he could kiss me.

10:12.220 --> 10:14.340
I didn't know how to say no.

10:18.940 --> 10:21.180
So I just sort of let him do the rest.

10:22.500 --> 10:25.659
Afterwards, he said he wanted to
meet again but not to tell anyone

10:25.660 --> 10:26.916
because his wife didn't know.

10:28.083 --> 10:31.100
When he asks a favour like that,
you can feel the power.

10:32.940 --> 10:36.100
And so, we started meeting after that.

10:37.260 --> 10:38.700
How long for?

10:38.999 --> 10:40.279
Six months.

10:41.680 --> 10:43.199
Then he said it had to finish,

10:43.200 --> 10:46.980
and put £10,000 in my account
as a start-up business fund.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.660
Did you tell anyone?

10:55.260 --> 10:56.820
I've struggled.

10:57.244 --> 11:01.108
I'm not good with men, or trust,
or whatever...

11:02.500 --> 11:03.979
...so I came back home.

11:03.980 --> 11:06.579
And then one night he was on the TV,

11:06.580 --> 11:09.459
and I ended up finally telling
Mum and Dad what happened.

11:09.460 --> 11:12.980
And, as I said it,
I knew I wasn't the only one.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.500
He's still doing it now.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.539
But it's how it starts, right?

11:23.540 --> 11:25.099
With all these men.

11:25.100 --> 11:27.322
One person steps forward.

12:02.100 --> 12:04.739
- Prime Minister.
- Duncan. Thanks for coming.

12:04.740 --> 12:06.219
- Did you order ahead?
- Er, yeah.

12:06.220 --> 12:08.579
The food's not bad here,
but your choice is limited

12:08.580 --> 12:10.456
by whether the Secret Service
are happy with it.

12:10.457 --> 12:12.820
- Why, are people out to kill you?
- Apparently so.

12:13.188 --> 12:14.428
After you.

12:14.453 --> 12:15.733
Thank you.

12:18.300 --> 12:20.699
Speaking of people trying to kill you,

12:20.700 --> 12:23.070
I'm glad you and Jane
are hanging in there.

12:23.095 --> 12:24.089
Sorry?

12:24.090 --> 12:26.259
The highest office in the land
causes marital tension.

12:26.260 --> 12:27.819
It's well documented.

12:27.820 --> 12:29.815
Have you guys worked through
your problems...?

12:29.816 --> 12:31.638
We have as much family time as possible.

12:31.663 --> 12:32.624
Do you?

12:32.625 --> 12:35.242
Why do I always feel like I'm being
interviewed when I'm talking to you?

12:35.243 --> 12:38.780
Interesting. When I talk to you, I
always feel like I'm being lied to.

12:39.987 --> 12:41.707
I suspect we're in the right jobs.

12:42.229 --> 12:44.659
This is all off the record,
just to be clear.

12:44.660 --> 12:46.819
If that means no bullshit, fine with me.

12:46.820 --> 12:48.353
Not a lot of people get away

12:48.378 --> 12:49.819
with speaking to the Prime
Minister like that.

12:49.820 --> 12:52.659
You're not the president,
not the head of state.

12:52.660 --> 12:56.162
I didn't have to let you sit down
first, that was a courtesy.

12:56.163 --> 13:00.059
All you are is the most senior
representative doing your job.

13:00.060 --> 13:02.339
Since I'm the most senior
representative doing mine,

13:02.340 --> 13:04.600
I reckon we're equal.
Anyway, about my favour.

13:04.601 --> 13:05.555
Sorry?

13:05.580 --> 13:08.204
You said you owed me one,
and I'm cashing it in.

13:09.180 --> 13:11.379
Right, well, what do you want?

13:11.380 --> 13:12.900
A photo shoot.

13:13.615 --> 13:18.619
A feature with a load of photos of
you, Jane and the kids, at Chequers.

13:18.620 --> 13:20.939
- We don't do photos of the children.
- I know you haven't.

13:20.940 --> 13:22.466
Jane and I agreed...

13:22.491 --> 13:23.871
Look, there's a first
time for everything.

13:23.872 --> 13:27.073
You said the food's good here.
Is it quick? I am hungry!

13:27.074 --> 13:29.339
It's my decision to be in politics,
not the children's.

13:29.340 --> 13:31.140
So, anything else instead.

13:32.940 --> 13:35.060
I don't want anything else.

13:35.474 --> 13:36.839
Look, speak to Jane.

13:36.840 --> 13:39.559
Say you need me on side.

13:39.560 --> 13:41.779
Jane likes me, she'll understand.

13:41.780 --> 13:43.900
Ah, finally!

13:49.060 --> 13:50.780
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

13:52.100 --> 13:55.019
- Why do you want this?
- Not me! It's what the people want.

13:55.020 --> 13:57.419
It'll be an exclusive,
and boost our sales.

13:57.420 --> 13:58.660
But why now?

13:59.860 --> 14:01.980
Because you owe me a favour.

14:05.420 --> 14:07.660
- When?
- I thought this weekend.

14:07.930 --> 14:10.100
Are the family all at home on Sunday?

14:12.523 --> 14:14.100
I'd...

14:14.507 --> 14:16.580
I'd want something else from you.

14:17.340 --> 14:18.939
But I've already done the favour.

14:18.940 --> 14:22.300
A reporter from the Herald
called about Resonance last week.

14:22.957 --> 14:24.699
Resonance. What's that?

14:24.700 --> 14:26.219
Is that a band?

14:26.220 --> 14:28.619
Well, if you don't know,
I'm not going to tell you.

14:28.620 --> 14:31.918
But if it comes to you, don't touch it.

14:31.919 --> 14:33.659
Let it go away.

14:33.660 --> 14:35.060
Oh...

14:36.100 --> 14:38.819
No, there's clearly a story there.

14:38.820 --> 14:42.499
And you expect, having told me,
a professional journalist,

14:42.500 --> 14:44.819
having shown me
how worried you are about it,

14:44.820 --> 14:46.419
that I was going to drop it?

14:46.420 --> 14:48.139
I know that's unusual.

14:48.140 --> 14:49.540
It's disgraceful.

14:50.773 --> 14:52.213
I can't believe you asked.

14:55.753 --> 14:57.873
No problem, if I get my photo.

14:58.227 --> 14:59.979
Can I trust you?

14:59.980 --> 15:02.739
I drive a hard bargain,
but I'm actually very honest.

15:02.740 --> 15:04.620
Can I give you an example?

15:04.914 --> 15:06.299
What?

15:06.300 --> 15:08.100
This food is bad,

15:08.219 --> 15:10.299
and you need a better suit.

15:12.420 --> 15:13.580
Right.

15:17.620 --> 15:20.028
- Mr Newman?
- There's no-one there.

15:20.740 --> 15:23.619
The neighbour says he's gone to
stay with family.

15:23.620 --> 15:26.716
- Packed a bag and left.
- Oh, OK.

15:27.700 --> 15:31.419
- Why did you want him?
- No reason.

15:31.420 --> 15:34.859
It's not because he lives on the
same caravan park as a boy

15:34.860 --> 15:37.060
that yesterday was killed on the
way back from school,

15:37.571 --> 15:39.979
and apparently Mr Newman's a
friend of the mum?

15:39.980 --> 15:42.499
Courier? Today? World News?

15:42.500 --> 15:43.818
The Post.

15:45.060 --> 15:47.619
You're obviously the Herald.

15:47.620 --> 15:49.946
I've been here since first
thing this morning.

15:50.540 --> 15:52.139
Early bird.

15:52.140 --> 15:55.619
Yeah, but there's no point
staying now. He's gone.

15:55.620 --> 15:57.619
- Why are you still here, then?
- I'm not.

15:57.620 --> 16:00.092
I've, I've got everything I need.
I'm going back to London.

16:00.093 --> 16:01.420
On to the next thing.

16:01.445 --> 16:03.404
- You're going now?
- Er, yep.

16:05.660 --> 16:08.139
And he's away for a couple of days?

16:08.140 --> 16:09.779
That's what they said.

16:09.780 --> 16:12.940
OK, well, in that case I think I'm
done, too.

16:14.860 --> 16:18.419
- Did you drive?
- Train. Means I can work more.

16:18.420 --> 16:20.504
Oh, do you want a lift,
back to the station?

16:20.505 --> 16:23.501
That's my car right there.
Save you some time.

16:24.260 --> 16:27.805
Honestly, it's not a problem.
I'm Ed, by the way.

16:29.060 --> 16:30.542
Leona.

16:44.180 --> 16:47.899
- Really kind of you.
- I just think there's no point.

16:47.900 --> 16:50.739
We're not really in competition, are
we, the Post and Herald?

16:50.740 --> 16:54.500
Different readers.
Colleagues, not rivals.

16:54.857 --> 16:56.259
Yeah.

16:56.260 --> 16:59.579
I'll see you at some point, I expect.

16:59.580 --> 17:01.100
That would be good.

17:02.620 --> 17:05.500
- Have a good journey back.
- You too.

17:05.853 --> 17:07.133
Thanks.

17:30.180 --> 17:32.000
Thank you. Thank you very much.

17:32.025 --> 17:33.179
- See you.
- Bye.

17:33.180 --> 17:36.299
♪ All these things were done in secret

17:36.300 --> 17:39.460
♪ All these things were done in secret. ♪

17:47.260 --> 17:49.415
- I thought you were...
- Er, we're in the middle of something.

17:49.416 --> 17:50.731
I was here first.

17:50.756 --> 17:52.979
- Well, you left.
- I pretended to leave.

17:52.980 --> 17:54.172
So did I.

17:54.197 --> 17:56.739
- Who is it?
- Mr Newman...

17:56.740 --> 17:59.175
It's a reporter from the Post, Geoff.

17:59.176 --> 18:01.219
But we talked about this.

18:01.220 --> 18:03.940
How do you all know where I live?

18:04.452 --> 18:06.292
What are those?

18:07.220 --> 18:09.020
Brownies.

18:09.219 --> 18:11.059
She got me wine.

18:12.300 --> 18:15.990
You're fighting over me. I want to
stop. I don't want to do any of it.

18:15.991 --> 18:17.331
Mr Newman, you've got it all wrong.

18:17.332 --> 18:18.680
- Geoff!
- I promise you, we're not

18:18.705 --> 18:20.706
in competition, are we?

18:20.707 --> 18:21.712
Are we?

18:21.737 --> 18:25.722
Look, we just want to get the full,
truthful picture, all right?

18:25.723 --> 18:29.139
But, Geoff, why don't you talk to
both of us at the same time,

18:29.140 --> 18:33.299
to show you this isn't about
anything other than openness?

18:33.300 --> 18:36.930
I'm all right with that.
Leona will be too, right?

18:37.460 --> 18:38.700
Sure.

18:58.984 --> 19:03.139
- That's it. Ten seconds.
- Enough to know she's not lying.

19:03.140 --> 19:05.819
She filmed it secretly to show a
friend who didn't believe

19:05.820 --> 19:08.739
that they were together.
But she felt bad, never used it.

19:08.740 --> 19:11.139
Problem is, she doesn't mind us
seeing it, but no-one else.

19:11.140 --> 19:13.232
Well, if it's not admissible, we'll
need another source.

19:13.233 --> 19:16.099
She said there was a woman running
the course who seemed pissed

19:16.100 --> 19:18.539
off and that West had mentioned
they had a history.

19:18.540 --> 19:21.379
- Have you got a name?
- Susannah Hill.

19:21.380 --> 19:24.099
We can't run this unless we're
absolutely sure.

19:24.100 --> 19:25.700
Right OK.

19:28.580 --> 19:30.020
If this goes, I guarantee, next day,

19:30.045 --> 19:31.539
ten women a least will come forward.

19:31.540 --> 19:34.236
He's been running these
apprenticeship schemes for 20 years.

19:34.237 --> 19:37.179
You realise he gives away half his
earnings to charity?

19:37.180 --> 19:38.860
Maybe now we know why.

19:50.864 --> 19:51.790
Holly.

19:51.815 --> 19:53.004
- Mm-hmm.
- He's ready.

19:56.460 --> 19:58.499
Mr Hassan?

19:58.500 --> 20:01.670
- 'Hello?'
- Hi, it's Holly Evans from the Herald.

20:01.671 --> 20:03.676
I'm just editing
Chris Cartwright's piece.

20:03.677 --> 20:05.369
I was wondering if you could, er,

20:05.394 --> 20:07.299
help me with a few things.
Would that be OK?

20:07.300 --> 20:08.787
'Er. maybe you should check with him.'

20:08.812 --> 20:11.452
Oh, he's on a flight at the moment.
He's not available.

20:11.477 --> 20:12.485
'OK.'

20:14.540 --> 20:17.541
According to this, you
travelled on the fifth,

20:17.566 --> 20:19.259
had dinner at the embassy,

20:19.260 --> 20:22.379
the next night you met some of the
victims of the recent violence.

20:22.380 --> 20:24.139
Then travelled the next day,

20:24.140 --> 20:26.271
had dinner in the village that
evening, and it was that night

20:26.272 --> 20:28.945
when Chris met with the leaders of
the rebel faction, on the seventh.

20:28.970 --> 20:30.539
'Er, yes, that's right.'

20:30.540 --> 20:34.060
- Were you with him the whole time?
- 'I haven't read the article.'

20:35.873 --> 20:37.313
I'm sorry?

20:37.933 --> 20:39.813
'I haven't read the article.'

20:40.900 --> 20:44.331
OK Mr Hassan, you do...

20:44.332 --> 20:46.739
'That was our itinerary, yes?

20:46.740 --> 20:49.836
'I think you should speak to
Mr Cartwright.'

20:50.340 --> 20:51.820
All right.

20:52.620 --> 20:54.897
That was very helpful, thank you.

20:56.485 --> 20:59.260
- Bye.
- 'Bye.'

21:10.260 --> 21:13.859
- Hi.
- We were right.

21:13.860 --> 21:15.183
Really?

21:16.620 --> 21:18.420
OK, thanks.

21:22.820 --> 21:24.499
What?

21:24.500 --> 21:27.860
Another man, Peter.
Another man letting me down.

21:32.180 --> 21:33.460
All right?

21:34.860 --> 21:36.340
Very good.

21:43.840 --> 21:45.720
I'll see you tomorrow.

22:02.605 --> 22:05.379
- Hey... You all right?
- Hi.

22:05.380 --> 22:10.899
- Yeah. Good day?
- Busy. You?

22:10.900 --> 22:12.060
Very.

22:14.060 --> 22:15.899
Yeah, I made a pie.

22:15.900 --> 22:18.339
It's in the oven,
to say thanks for letting me stay.

22:18.340 --> 22:19.631
Didn't know you cooked.

22:19.656 --> 22:21.779
You want to sit down?
I got some wine as well.

22:21.780 --> 22:24.827
It's cheap, but if we drink
enough, it won't matter.

22:36.060 --> 22:38.935
- Not used to this.
- Least I can do.

23:54.820 --> 23:56.820
You have 23 new messages.

23:59.060 --> 24:01.667
- So, Duncan Allen sent you an IPad.
- How do you know?

24:01.668 --> 24:05.059
I'm an investigative journalist,
I have an instinct for these things.

24:05.060 --> 24:07.246
- You read the label.
- Explain.

24:07.271 --> 24:08.339
Nothing to explain.

24:08.340 --> 24:11.379
Twice a week he sends me a present.
Started as an umbrella,

24:11.380 --> 24:14.699
then a posh pen,
then a weekend break away,

24:14.700 --> 24:15.780
now an iPad.

24:15.805 --> 24:17.739
- Why?
- I don't know.

24:17.740 --> 24:20.385
What, is it a bribe? Does he want
you to work for him? He must know...

24:20.386 --> 24:22.958
I've sent them all back so he
should get the message.

24:24.140 --> 24:27.579
- Sorry. Are you...
- Uh, yes, James Edwards.

24:27.580 --> 24:29.779
This is Holly Evans, my editor.

24:29.780 --> 24:31.619
I need to keep moving, come on.

24:31.620 --> 24:33.454
I've got 20 minutes
and then I need to go.

24:33.455 --> 24:36.620
It's the only time I get for
exercise. Come on.

24:40.340 --> 24:44.459
We've spoken to someone who attended
the apprenticeship scheme.

24:44.460 --> 24:47.739
She's told us that West put pressure
on her to sleep with him.

24:47.740 --> 24:50.539
She had the feeling that it wasn't
the first time he'd done it,

24:50.540 --> 24:53.499
- and she said that you...
- You're talking about Rachel Gilmour.

24:53.500 --> 24:54.804
She called me last week,

24:54.805 --> 24:57.099
wanted me to talk to the press
at the same time.

24:57.100 --> 24:58.690
Said it would strengthen her story.

24:58.715 --> 25:01.019
She's right. If we can show
a pattern of behaviour...

25:01.020 --> 25:02.979
- Do you pay?
- I'm sorry?

25:02.980 --> 25:04.779
Do you pay for stories?

25:04.780 --> 25:08.299
No, we... No, we can't.

25:08.300 --> 25:10.099
Something for nothing? OK.

25:10.100 --> 25:12.670
Look, Susannah, we realise that you
might not want to talk about this,

25:12.671 --> 25:14.137
but we want to give you
the opportunity to...

25:14.162 --> 25:15.662
It wasn't illegal.

25:15.663 --> 25:19.059
They were all 18, 19, sometimes 20.

25:19.060 --> 25:20.379
"All"?

25:20.380 --> 25:23.577
I know what you're saying about
influence and power,

25:23.578 --> 25:27.074
but that's sexy, isn't it?
When you're young,

25:27.075 --> 25:31.717
it's flattering to be appreciated by
an attractive mature man.

25:31.718 --> 25:33.819
I mean, it happens all the time.

25:33.820 --> 25:35.940
So you did have a relationship with him?

25:38.940 --> 25:42.139
Off the record, don't use my name.

25:42.140 --> 25:44.419
Your account would be so
much more useful to...

25:44.420 --> 25:46.180
Yeah, that's fine. Off the record.

25:49.260 --> 25:53.459
I did the apprentice scheme
four years before Rachel.

25:53.460 --> 25:55.115
There was a party at the end.

25:55.116 --> 25:58.978
Joshua was there,
and we ended up in a hotel.

25:58.979 --> 26:02.099
He helped me out with university
fees and finding a place to live.

26:02.100 --> 26:04.585
Later he got me back
teaching on the scheme.

26:04.586 --> 26:07.019
Were you in a relationship with
him the whole time?

26:07.020 --> 26:10.977
Not a relationship, but he'd let me
know when he was in town.

26:12.480 --> 26:13.640
Right.

26:15.620 --> 26:17.504
But then the year Rachel was there,

26:17.505 --> 26:21.779
he didn't want to know any more,
he, erm, he put an end to it.

26:21.780 --> 26:25.328
He didn't... He took away all the
help he was giving me.

26:25.820 --> 26:27.320
Why?

26:28.660 --> 26:30.248
He said he'd done enough.

26:31.580 --> 26:33.856
He was right. He'd done a lot for me.

26:36.460 --> 26:38.432
In return for...?

26:47.617 --> 26:50.562
You implied that he'd slept with other
women during the apprenticeship.

26:50.563 --> 26:54.379
Obviously he didn't tell me about
it, but... common knowledge.

26:54.380 --> 26:57.259
He's a driven man. He gets what he wants.

26:57.260 --> 26:59.939
Susannah, are you sure you don't
want to go on the record?

26:59.940 --> 27:02.419
There could be other women who
have felt exploited.

27:02.420 --> 27:05.100
He could still be approaching
young women like this.

27:08.300 --> 27:10.988
I have a career, a reputation.

27:10.989 --> 27:12.900
It's the last thing I need.

27:14.620 --> 27:16.260
It's the past.

27:18.353 --> 27:19.833
For you.

27:25.340 --> 27:28.216
The first time we had sex, he was gentle.

27:28.217 --> 27:31.230
But after that he didn't care.

27:33.893 --> 27:36.733
Sometimes he'd hold so tight
there'd be bruises.

27:38.980 --> 27:42.540
That's the sort of thing you want,
right? The detail.

27:44.940 --> 27:47.487
You know, being with him
taught me something,

27:48.812 --> 27:50.412
survival of the fittest.

27:52.639 --> 27:54.199
You should try it.

28:32.140 --> 28:33.420
Holly.

28:38.100 --> 28:41.419
'So you've got, er, one person who's
willing to go on record and

28:41.420 --> 28:44.134
'another anonymous source who
doesn't sound the most reliable.'

28:44.135 --> 28:46.464
Well, once it's in print,
others will come forward.

28:46.489 --> 28:47.540
'Peter?'

28:47.541 --> 28:50.459
- How's the champagne?
- Peter...

28:50.460 --> 28:53.659
'I think we should run it.'
It's what we're here for,

28:53.660 --> 28:56.499
to speak truth to the powerful, right?

28:56.500 --> 28:59.619
It's a brilliant story,
you guys should be proud.

28:59.620 --> 29:02.500
You want to make an impact,
to take risks?

29:02.860 --> 29:05.180
This is the moment.

29:20.580 --> 29:21.950
We'll run it.

29:21.951 --> 29:25.979
'Front page, background articles, the
business, his family, his history.'

29:25.980 --> 29:28.739
Talk to Imogen's team. I want this
completely clear, legally.

29:28.740 --> 29:31.775
- 'Nothing to get in our way, OK?'
- Yep, no problem.

29:31.776 --> 29:34.339
And get a response from West
as soon as you can.

29:34.340 --> 29:37.099
Well done, this is good. Better go.

29:37.100 --> 29:40.419
- Enjoy it.
- Thank you, I will.

29:40.420 --> 29:44.099
- Amina. Oh, dear. Still working?
- Yeah, always working.

29:44.100 --> 29:46.859
I'm just delighted you've
found time to be here.

29:46.860 --> 29:49.699
It's very kind of you to organise
all this for my benefit.

29:49.700 --> 29:53.340
- Well, what do you mean?
- This reception. I know what this is.

29:53.341 --> 29:56.125
We do a similar thing when we're
trying to get someone on the board,

29:56.126 --> 30:00.739
but I am already on the board, so
this is for some other purpose.

30:00.740 --> 30:04.659
Ever since I arrived, people keep
asking me questions about

30:04.660 --> 30:07.598
myself, what drives me.

30:08.220 --> 30:11.632
And then I spoke to Antony and he
said he was looking forward

30:11.633 --> 30:14.071
to having more time to travel.
I thought he meant a holiday,

30:14.072 --> 30:16.699
but then I realised
there's going to be a vacancy.

30:16.700 --> 30:19.979
- You know, you're very perceptive.
- Sort of my job.

30:19.980 --> 30:22.699
- Well, nothing's confirmed.
- I'm happy where I am.

30:22.700 --> 30:26.059
Well, sure, but we need you
to open this place up.

30:26.060 --> 30:29.539
Outreach, education,
our profile, ticket prices.

30:29.540 --> 30:33.139
You know, you're well-liked here,
by everyone.

30:33.140 --> 30:34.699
Hugely respected.

30:34.700 --> 30:38.939
I don't know anything about opera.

30:38.940 --> 30:41.299
You didn't, but now you do.

30:41.300 --> 30:43.299
And you're an outsider,

30:43.300 --> 30:45.100
which is just what we need.

30:46.500 --> 30:49.140
Let me show you something.

30:54.380 --> 30:56.540
Wow! SHE LAUGHS

30:59.500 --> 31:02.340
Well, this would basically
be your office.

31:04.500 --> 31:07.135
It's a thing of wonder,

31:07.860 --> 31:09.900
and it should be for everyone.

31:18.740 --> 31:22.099
Only going for his third front
page in as many days.

31:22.100 --> 31:23.508
Better be good. What have you got?

31:23.533 --> 31:25.259
Well, he was round there all the time,

31:25.260 --> 31:27.379
but he wasn't a friend,
he was there as a handyman,

31:27.380 --> 31:30.019
but apparently, every week he'd
find reasons to go in.

31:30.020 --> 31:31.428
OK, good, keep going.

31:31.980 --> 31:33.587
He's one of us now.

31:34.924 --> 31:36.499
What does that mean?

31:36.500 --> 31:38.380
It means you should start worrying.

31:38.720 --> 31:40.680
He likes you.

31:42.980 --> 31:44.739
Nice dress.

31:44.740 --> 31:46.601
Get back to work.

31:47.020 --> 31:48.857
- Anything?
- Not yet.

31:48.882 --> 31:50.299
Not a holding response?

31:50.300 --> 31:53.139
- That's, what...?
- Four hours and 33 minutes.

31:53.140 --> 31:55.693
- If we don't hear?
- Before we're off Stone? We will.

31:55.694 --> 31:58.779
- But if we don't, we still run it?
- Absolutely. He's had his chance.

31:58.780 --> 32:00.859
- OK.
- OK.

32:00.860 --> 32:03.019
Chris is waiting in there.

32:03.020 --> 32:06.140
- OK.
- Well, he said I had nice legs.

32:08.219 --> 32:10.179
Yeah. Leave it to me.

32:15.620 --> 32:17.819
I won it, fair and square.

32:17.820 --> 32:20.014
Oh, I'm not arguing that.

32:21.020 --> 32:23.986
Although you did know half the jury,
maybe that made a difference.

32:23.987 --> 32:26.739
Either way you've moved up in the
food chain, Amina,

32:26.740 --> 32:28.783
and you've really found your place.

32:28.808 --> 32:31.059
My assistant said you liked her legs.

32:31.060 --> 32:33.779
I'm from a different generation.

32:33.780 --> 32:35.931
Do you always say that when
you get something wrong?

32:35.956 --> 32:37.379
Always.

32:37.380 --> 32:41.059
Don't worry,
I'll apologise when we finish.

32:41.060 --> 32:42.881
Probably best you just leave her alone.

32:42.906 --> 32:44.379
How can I help?

32:44.380 --> 32:46.490
We got a call from you on Thursday night.

32:46.491 --> 32:49.019
Are you aware of that?
We heard you snoring.

32:49.020 --> 32:50.782
I probably had a drink.

32:50.807 --> 32:52.769
It's just from when you filed your piece,

32:52.770 --> 32:56.048
and from what your fixer says, you
were meeting the rebels that night.

32:56.049 --> 32:59.699
You interviewed them at exactly the
same time we know you were asleep.

32:59.700 --> 33:02.659
Well, I must have got the timeline
confused. Another night, then, maybe.

33:02.660 --> 33:04.330
No, we've been through your schedule,

33:04.355 --> 33:05.807
we've checked with the people around you.

33:05.808 --> 33:08.585
You're spoken for every other
night you were there.

33:10.700 --> 33:13.619
Chris, did you meet the rebels?

33:13.620 --> 33:15.700
Did that interview take place?

33:20.420 --> 33:21.580
I'm a journalist

33:21.605 --> 33:24.584
- of 35 years' experience.
- I know.

33:24.585 --> 33:27.053
I'm in the business of telling the truth,

33:27.078 --> 33:28.699
of telling stories.

33:28.700 --> 33:32.699
We decide what to emphasise in what
we write, what to put in,

33:32.700 --> 33:33.775
what to leave out,

33:33.776 --> 33:37.099
with the sole intention of making
whatever point the story intends,

33:37.100 --> 33:39.460
of conjuring not just the facts

33:39.485 --> 33:41.179
- but what it feels like.
- Wait...

33:41.180 --> 33:45.863
Every quote in that piece was said
to me by someone I met.

33:47.460 --> 33:49.660
Oh, God, Chris!

33:52.460 --> 33:55.139
It's better the way I've written it.

33:55.140 --> 33:59.179
Carries more authority if it's all
happening on one night.

33:59.180 --> 34:03.459
- But it's not true!
- The heart of it absolutely is.

34:03.460 --> 34:06.059
All we have left is trust.

34:06.060 --> 34:09.059
If people want rumour or opinion,
they can get that anywhere.

34:09.060 --> 34:11.627
It IS the most important thing.
Of course it is.

34:11.652 --> 34:13.819
Amina, my articles have
changed the world!

34:13.820 --> 34:16.938
They've incited revolution, been
widely read, they're very popular,

34:16.940 --> 34:20.199
not to mention the fact that
I've won a fair few awards myself.

34:20.199 --> 34:22.976
So, whatever it is I'm doing
and however it's done,

34:22.976 --> 34:25.460
it has real impact!

34:26.686 --> 34:28.646
So this isn't the first time?

34:32.020 --> 34:33.739
I'm not saying that.

34:35.299 --> 34:39.500
35 years, and anything
you've written could be...

34:41.380 --> 34:43.659
We're going to have to go
through all of them,

34:43.659 --> 34:46.219
every single article you've
ever been involved in!

34:46.245 --> 34:47.283
No!

34:47.284 --> 34:48.446
When this gets out...

34:48.471 --> 34:50.739
- It doesn't have to get out!
- It does!

34:50.739 --> 34:53.899
And when it does, there will be
questions about all of it,

34:53.900 --> 34:55.513
and we are going to have to
know the facts,

34:55.514 --> 34:57.500
know exactly what you lied about!

35:01.298 --> 35:03.579
Not lies, Amina.

35:03.580 --> 35:06.499
It was never anything that
changed the substance!

35:06.500 --> 35:09.470
But sometimes the stars just don't align!

35:09.495 --> 35:10.764
No.

35:17.820 --> 35:19.540
Right.

35:21.460 --> 35:23.739
Then just let me go.

35:23.740 --> 35:27.896
Don't investigate.
I'll just leave quietly.

35:28.620 --> 35:31.700
I used to read your pieces when
I was a student.

35:33.980 --> 35:36.605
When I started as editor here,
I thought of different

35:36.606 --> 35:41.118
reporters as our mouthpiece,
our heart, our public face.

35:41.119 --> 35:44.067
YOU were supposed to be our conscience.

35:44.900 --> 35:47.220
It's the reputation of the entire paper.

35:51.220 --> 35:53.828
Then I won't work again.

35:57.060 --> 35:59.220
A different generation...

36:03.260 --> 36:04.980
Oh, yeah.

36:58.020 --> 37:00.103
Not enough substance.

37:00.780 --> 37:02.779
We know he's a weirdo,

37:02.780 --> 37:06.379
we know he likes guns, but there's
no actual evidence against him.

37:06.380 --> 37:08.339
We're not getting anywhere,
let's move on.

37:08.340 --> 37:11.619
- He's under siege by reporters.
- That's worse, it's a story about us.

37:11.620 --> 37:14.699
The people on the campsite said he
used to offer to help anyone.

37:14.700 --> 37:16.296
Especially families with young children.

37:16.297 --> 37:19.339
- Did anyone call him a paedophile?
- I'm sorry?

37:19.340 --> 37:22.859
Did anyone say the word
"paedophile" at any point?

37:22.860 --> 37:23.979
No.

37:23.980 --> 37:27.259
If they had, that's the kind of word
we'd want on the front page.

37:27.260 --> 37:29.419
That moves the story on.

37:29.420 --> 37:32.123
"Weirdo paedo preying on the community."

37:32.124 --> 37:35.019
But if your sources didn't
say that, then...

37:35.020 --> 37:37.739
Prime Minister's office is
on the line. They say it's urgent.

37:37.740 --> 37:41.418
- See how important I am?
- Look, I could call some of them again.

37:41.419 --> 37:42.869
The residents, see if
I can get them to...

37:42.894 --> 37:44.560
Yeah, yeah. See what they say.

37:50.940 --> 37:54.012
Is it true?
Has he split up with his wife?

37:56.140 --> 37:57.939
He just told you to do something, mate,

37:57.940 --> 38:00.300
and the clock's ticking. Hear it?

38:08.420 --> 38:11.859
- Matthew, how can I help?
- 'Duncan, look, we, I...'

38:11.860 --> 38:13.579
I'm getting pressure from Jane here.

38:13.580 --> 38:15.248
'The children didn't enjoy today.

38:15.273 --> 38:16.899
They don't want the pictures published.'

38:16.900 --> 38:18.779
It turns out they're being
bullied at school.

38:18.780 --> 38:20.939
'We didn't know, but it's, well,
it's all come out,

38:20.940 --> 38:22.312
'and the idea that everyone in the world

38:22.337 --> 38:23.511
will know what they look like...'

38:23.512 --> 38:25.027
You know where these pictures are going?

38:25.052 --> 38:27.423
- Tell me they're going in the bin.
- No, front page!

38:27.424 --> 38:30.295
They look great! 'Look, we're off
stone in ten minutes.'

38:30.296 --> 38:33.980
- Off stone means we're printing, so...
- 'Yeah, Duncan, look, I, I'm...'

38:54.172 --> 38:56.170
Have you ever known them
not to get back at all?

38:56.195 --> 38:57.182
No.

38:59.820 --> 39:02.339
Maybe he's sorting out his family life.

39:02.340 --> 39:05.524
He knows he can't fight it, so he's
got to get things ready.

39:05.940 --> 39:09.728
Maybe. There's nothing we've missed?

39:09.729 --> 39:12.215
We saw the video, we had the
testament from the second source.

39:12.216 --> 39:14.824
We did it. He can't deny it.

39:17.820 --> 39:19.605
Are all the other pages in?

39:19.630 --> 39:21.124
- Yeah.
- OK.

39:30.540 --> 39:33.059
Yep, thank you. Bye. Got it!

39:33.060 --> 39:34.762
- Yep?
- Yep. She said it.

39:34.763 --> 39:36.887
"You wonder if he could be a
paedophile or something".

39:36.912 --> 39:38.379
Yes!

39:38.380 --> 39:40.739
We'll hold for five minutes, no longer.

39:40.740 --> 39:44.019
- You still want the PM?
- Are you joking? Yeah.

39:44.020 --> 39:48.342
I want the word "paedophile"
inches from his face.

39:48.940 --> 39:51.479
That should get them flying
off the shelves.

39:54.380 --> 39:55.503
Send it.

39:56.580 --> 40:00.700
Mm-hmm. Charlie, it's on its way.

40:02.020 --> 40:03.244
Done.

40:05.100 --> 40:06.620
Good.

40:32.620 --> 40:34.939
- What about that drink?
- Yeah.

40:34.940 --> 40:36.582
- Yeah, good.
- Yeah? Amina?

40:36.607 --> 40:38.939
- Yeah? YOU'RE going?
- I'm buying.

40:38.940 --> 40:41.219
I know, a rare moment of freedom.

40:41.220 --> 40:44.180
- Peter's on the loose! Let's roll.
- Ooh!

40:46.060 --> 40:47.580
All right.

41:26.820 --> 41:29.819
- Has he responded yet?
- No.

41:29.820 --> 41:32.819
OK, then. It's done.

41:32.820 --> 41:34.540
Cheers.

41:35.940 --> 41:37.578
- Cheers, everyone.
- Cheers, everyone!

41:37.603 --> 41:40.139
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

41:40.140 --> 41:42.660
Cheers, cheers, cheers, well done.

41:59.980 --> 42:01.387
It's the only time

42:01.412 --> 42:03.099
- I've ever been in a fight.
- Yeah.

42:03.100 --> 42:06.499
He's already hit me, I'm still
trying to interview him, right?

42:06.500 --> 42:08.579
- There's blood coming down my nose.
- Oh, my God!

42:08.580 --> 42:11.419
I'm on the floor, I don't hit him
back. I'm just like,

42:11.420 --> 42:13.149
"You're not answering my question!"

42:13.174 --> 42:15.652
And every time I said
it, he's like, whack!

42:15.653 --> 42:17.364
Hits me again!

42:17.365 --> 42:19.900
Anyway, I eventually got
the answer out of him.

42:19.925 --> 42:21.819
Made my career, actually.

42:21.820 --> 42:23.751
Peter, they're going.

42:23.752 --> 42:26.340
Oh, hey! Bye, see you later, take care.

42:26.365 --> 42:27.859
- Bye!
- Well done!

42:27.860 --> 42:30.339
- Well done! Love you.
- What are you doing?

42:30.340 --> 42:32.259
I'm going to get the train. Choo-choo!

42:32.260 --> 42:34.499
What? It's 11:30, there
aren't any trains.

42:34.500 --> 42:37.218
No, it's not, it's 10:30,
it's 10:30... It's 11:30.

42:37.219 --> 42:39.339
It's 11:30. Stay at mine.

42:40.860 --> 42:42.819
- I can't.
- Why not?

42:42.820 --> 42:44.459
Deeply unprofessional.

42:44.460 --> 42:47.305
Only if we touch each other, Peter, and
that's not going to happen, is it?

42:47.330 --> 42:48.338
I hope not.

42:48.339 --> 42:50.694
Cos you're married with kids,
and I don't fancy you.

42:50.695 --> 42:53.380
- All right.
- All right. Come on, then.

42:54.363 --> 42:56.819
If you're lucky,
I'll play you some opera.

42:56.820 --> 42:58.500
Oh, Jesus!

42:59.740 --> 43:01.700
- Oh Jesus.

45:32.499 --> 45:34.284
- We did.
- Yeah.

45:42.540 --> 45:44.459
Thomas.

45:44.460 --> 45:45.780
Have they told you?

45:54.140 --> 45:55.898
I don't understand, it's out.

45:55.923 --> 45:57.899
No, not yet. West came
back with his lawyers.

45:57.900 --> 46:00.339
They want an injunction claiming
intrusion of his privacy.

46:00.340 --> 46:01.764
- Papers have gone.
- No, no, no.

46:01.789 --> 46:03.779
They've pulled the lorries
over, they're waiting.

46:03.780 --> 46:05.418
They said we had to see a judge,
why are we in Chiswick?

46:05.419 --> 46:08.728
The urgency of this case means it's
dealt with by the duty judge,

46:08.729 --> 46:10.742
David Walters, who lives at number 35.

46:10.743 --> 46:13.059
Given that it's the middle of the night,

46:13.060 --> 46:14.659
he decreed that we should come to him.

46:14.660 --> 46:16.860
- You told me 107.
- Yeah.

46:24.859 --> 46:26.259
Morning.

46:28.660 --> 46:30.060
May I?

46:41.199 --> 46:42.606
Come on, then.

46:43.820 --> 46:45.660
Get yourself somewhere to sit down.

46:48.580 --> 46:51.260
One side here, one side here.

46:56.300 --> 47:00.539
Most of my colleagues do this in
their homes but, um,

47:00.540 --> 47:05.939
my kids are asleep,
and since I am a church elder,

47:05.940 --> 47:08.220
I'll make the most of the privileges.

47:10.820 --> 47:12.790
Besides, you never know...

47:13.780 --> 47:16.020
...perhaps it'll give us all some
perspective.

47:20.180 --> 47:21.292
Tea?

47:21.317 --> 47:22.739
- I'm fine.
- No, thank you.

47:22.740 --> 47:24.299
All right, then.

47:24.300 --> 47:29.099
I've read the submission,
I get the outline,

47:29.100 --> 47:31.619
but make your case. You are
West's team, right?

47:31.620 --> 47:34.339
- That's correct, Your Honour.
- How did I know?

47:34.340 --> 47:36.789
Anya Fyles, on behalf of Joshua West.

47:37.760 --> 47:41.640
Now, I am no specialist in this
field, as I'm sure you're aware,

47:41.989 --> 47:46.280
so all I have to do is make a
decision as to whether there

47:46.281 --> 47:50.059
is likely to be a good chance of a
long-term injunction being granted.

47:50.060 --> 47:53.139
If so, I will make a temporary
injunction tonight.

47:53.140 --> 47:56.699
Your Honour, before we proceed, we
want to state for the record

47:56.700 --> 47:59.459
that the Herald has already spent
hundreds of thousands of

47:59.460 --> 48:01.939
pounds getting these papers
printed and distributed.

48:01.940 --> 48:04.699
It is now too late to print an
alternative front page.

48:04.700 --> 48:08.339
Mr West was notified at 1pm today
and has only now decided to

48:08.340 --> 48:11.259
come forward in the early hours
of this morning.

48:11.260 --> 48:14.139
If this paper were to be in
some way stopped,

48:14.140 --> 48:16.259
we would be hugely out of pocket.

48:16.260 --> 48:19.499
My client is happy to underwrite any
losses in the event of losing

48:19.500 --> 48:20.705
the injunction.

48:20.730 --> 48:23.859
Mr West is happy to pay to
pulp every single copy?

48:23.860 --> 48:26.299
And compensate for lost sales,
reputational damage?

48:26.300 --> 48:30.019
- If he were to lose the case, yes.
- It would be 2 million at least.

48:30.020 --> 48:31.780
That's not a problem.

48:34.980 --> 48:37.499
- There's nothing online yet?
- No.

48:37.500 --> 48:40.021
It was due to go up but
it's all been paused.

48:40.046 --> 48:41.259
Fine.

48:41.260 --> 48:44.739
Make your case, then. Lorries waiting.

48:44.740 --> 48:47.842
Our client has never used his
marriage or his wider family

48:47.843 --> 48:49.939
to promote his products or services.

48:49.940 --> 48:54.019
The two women mentioned in the story
were both consenting adults,

48:54.020 --> 48:58.179
and there is no suggestion of any
illegal sexual activity at

48:58.180 --> 48:59.819
any stage.

48:59.820 --> 49:03.579
The sole effect of this story going
public would be to devastate

49:03.580 --> 49:05.859
his children and his marriage.

49:05.860 --> 49:08.899
Crucially, there is no public
interest in the publication

49:08.900 --> 49:11.248
- of these accounts.
- There's absolutely public interest!

49:11.249 --> 49:13.659
But he's not denying the
accounts are true?

49:13.660 --> 49:16.740
That's not the basis on which he is
asking for the injunction.

49:20.180 --> 49:21.553
Who are you?

49:23.073 --> 49:26.379
Holly Evans, deputy news editor
at the Herald.

49:26.380 --> 49:28.780
I found the piece, wrote it, oversaw it.

49:30.380 --> 49:31.979
Yep?

49:31.980 --> 49:33.899
The public interest case is clear.

49:33.900 --> 49:37.049
Both women were groomed at courses
that were created and run,

49:37.050 --> 49:39.179
for young adults, by Mr West.

49:39.180 --> 49:42.259
He had an official and designated
position of power and

49:42.260 --> 49:44.659
- influence over them.
- They were not forced.

49:44.660 --> 49:47.139
- What are you doing?
- Your Honour?

49:47.140 --> 49:51.699
Are you cross-examining him?
Does this look like a courtroom?

49:51.700 --> 49:53.940
Pipe down or you can go and sit
in the kitchen.

49:59.820 --> 50:00.887
Carry on.

50:00.912 --> 50:04.059
These were programmes specifically
for young people, 18,

50:04.060 --> 50:07.779
19. Mr West was older, looked up to
by these women, trusted.

50:07.780 --> 50:10.402
Mr Walters, from what the women have
told us, West has done this

50:10.403 --> 50:11.782
many times before.

50:11.783 --> 50:14.714
Printing this story would encourage
other women to come forward.

50:14.715 --> 50:18.759
Mr West has decided to act as a
mentor for young people in business.

50:18.760 --> 50:22.379
There is a clear public
interest if he might in fact

50:22.380 --> 50:23.745
have a different agenda.

50:24.780 --> 50:28.499
- You're Amina...
- Chaudury, yes.

50:28.500 --> 50:30.339
Yeah, I've seen you on television.

50:30.340 --> 50:32.619
Quite a reputation.

50:32.620 --> 50:35.619
- You've been doing this for a while.
- Ten years as editor.

50:35.620 --> 50:38.403
I would never have allowed the story
to be published if there were

50:38.404 --> 50:40.449
not a clear and legitimate reason.

50:40.450 --> 50:43.042
Have you ever heard of a paper being
pulped after publication for

50:43.043 --> 50:44.466
a reason like this?

50:45.500 --> 50:48.979
There are clear procedures, we've
followed every single one of them.

50:48.980 --> 50:51.393
If you grant the temporary
injunction, there will be no

50:51.394 --> 50:54.539
printed paper tomorrow. And no,

50:54.540 --> 50:55.919
that has never happened.

50:55.920 --> 50:58.520
The only reason it could happen now
is because he can afford it.

50:58.521 --> 51:00.390
Let's not get dramatic.

51:00.391 --> 51:03.052
So long as they don't carry this
story, the digital edition,

51:03.053 --> 51:05.379
the app,
the website would all be unaffected.

51:05.380 --> 51:07.339
The physical paper is the
heart of what we do.

51:07.340 --> 51:09.079
Even if no-one reads it?

51:09.080 --> 51:12.019
But if the case is heard in the next
couple of days and he loses,

51:12.020 --> 51:14.859
- you can print the story then, right?
- He has far more resources than us.

51:14.860 --> 51:17.739
In two days he'll recruit every
top media lawyer.

51:17.740 --> 51:20.365
Thomas is good, but he's all we've got.

51:20.860 --> 51:24.259
You have little faith in a judge's
ability to see through all that?

51:24.260 --> 51:27.020
As I say,
I've been doing this a long time.

51:29.140 --> 51:30.989
How many children does Mr West have?

51:31.014 --> 51:32.379
- Three.
- How old?

51:32.380 --> 51:34.380
Eight, 12, 15.

51:37.900 --> 51:40.459
Any evidence it's not just
these two women?

51:40.460 --> 51:43.499
From their accounts, it's clear he
was experienced in the procedure.

51:43.500 --> 51:45.206
Do you have any evidence?

51:45.207 --> 51:46.872
I am certain that once this is out there,

51:46.897 --> 51:49.484
- there's going to be other women...
- No.

51:51.540 --> 51:53.100
At the moment, we don't.

51:55.900 --> 51:58.496
You're a good person, aren't
you, Miss Chaudury?

51:58.940 --> 52:00.956
You really want to do the right thing.

52:00.981 --> 52:01.980
Yes.

52:01.981 --> 52:04.940
You believe in truth, law and order.

52:05.940 --> 52:07.531
We all do.

52:08.580 --> 52:10.499
Morality.

52:10.500 --> 52:11.540
Yes.

52:14.226 --> 52:15.666
Good.

52:17.853 --> 52:19.373
I like that.

52:31.300 --> 52:33.939
But I'm sorry, I'm granting the
temporary injunction.

52:33.940 --> 52:38.428
Bring back those lorries,
pulp the papers, cease printing.

52:38.429 --> 52:41.823
It will be an offence to publish
this story online or to draw

52:41.824 --> 52:43.292
attention to this injunction,

52:43.317 --> 52:46.419
until such time as this case can be
brought before a specialist judge.

52:46.420 --> 52:48.139
- You don't understand...
- Your Honour...

52:48.140 --> 52:50.940
Put the chairs back where you
found them, thank you.

52:57.580 --> 52:59.427
Better do what he says.

53:00.140 --> 53:01.739
Get the lorries back.

53:01.740 --> 53:03.265
That's...

53:03.786 --> 53:05.346
Amina?

53:53.420 --> 53:55.220
Ten minutes.

54:52.180 --> 54:53.700
What?

54:58.980 --> 55:01.180
But how...? How did...?

55:11.340 --> 55:13.499
You paid her, Susannah Hill.

55:13.500 --> 55:16.979
- Nothing illegal about that.
- You didn't go to West for comment?

55:16.980 --> 55:19.499
Sometimes you don't want to
alert your prey.

55:19.500 --> 55:21.379
Nothing illegal about that either.

55:21.380 --> 55:23.779
Against every piece of
journalistic ethics.

55:23.780 --> 55:26.299
'I saw your first edition, you ran
something else.'

55:26.300 --> 55:28.419
'Yeah, we changed our minds.'

55:28.420 --> 55:31.179
What's the problem?
You sound really angry.

55:31.180 --> 55:34.459
- You know what happened last night.
- Do I?

55:34.460 --> 55:37.499
Of course you do!
You know everything that's going on!

55:37.500 --> 55:40.859
- You stole this!
- Were you working on something similar?

55:40.860 --> 55:43.619
Did he slap you down?

55:43.620 --> 55:46.899
'Oh, right.'
When someone's that powerful,

55:46.900 --> 55:49.739
you've just got to get it out there.

55:49.740 --> 55:52.939
How did you get the story at
exactly the same time?

55:52.940 --> 55:55.339
Something in the water, maybe.

55:55.340 --> 55:59.267
Bullshit! I just...
I will have to resign!

56:00.380 --> 56:04.444
Maybe, 'But I'm sure there's
something else that you could do.'

56:04.445 --> 56:06.411
Did the opera house ever get in
touch with you?

56:06.412 --> 56:08.804
'I told them that you were
getting restless.'

56:13.820 --> 56:15.659
That was you?

56:15.660 --> 56:18.500
Yeah. I thought I was doing you a favour.

56:20.820 --> 56:22.619
'What?'

56:22.620 --> 56:25.740
You're not angry about that as well,
are you? What...

56:31.220 --> 56:32.940
Shit!

56:35.900 --> 56:37.860
Ugh!

56:42.020 --> 56:44.460
It's my fault, how they got the story.

56:47.140 --> 56:49.191
My new flatmate, he works for the Post.

56:49.192 --> 56:52.251
- I think he stole it.
- OK.

56:53.820 --> 56:56.739
And then Duncan Allen chooses to publish.

56:56.740 --> 56:59.459
It's not what YOU'VE done,
it's what THEY'VE done.

56:59.460 --> 57:00.524
Don't resign.

57:00.549 --> 57:02.299
There's no paper, Holly,
do you understand?

57:02.300 --> 57:03.979
- We fight back.
- I am the editor,

57:03.980 --> 57:07.404
my one real job is to ensure the
continued daily publication of the

57:07.405 --> 57:11.340
newspaper, and for the first time in
living memory that hasn't happened.

57:21.386 --> 57:23.306
You can't just stay there.

57:25.780 --> 57:27.260
Fine.
