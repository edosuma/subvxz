02:27.300 --> 02:30.845
Your pal just drove into town,
Mr. McCarthy.

02:32.013 --> 02:33.973
I'll have one more, Toybo.

02:35.392 --> 02:38.311
I'm afraid I'll have to pay
my bar bill tomorrow.

02:38.395 --> 02:42.148
- You're good with me, Mr. McCarthy.
- Thank you, Toybo.

02:47.779 --> 02:51.116
- Good night, Toybo.
- Good night, Mr. McCarthy.

04:55.031 --> 04:56.282
<i>Operator.</i>

04:57.575 --> 04:59.827
Operator, I want...

04:59.910 --> 05:03.873
...489 Thunder Bay.
I want to speak to Mrs. Manion.

05:04.665 --> 05:06.542
M-A-N-I-O-N.

05:07.251 --> 05:10.588
This is Paul Biegler speaking.
Iron City 700.

05:23.184 --> 05:26.270
<i>- Will they know when she'll be there?
- No, they don't.</i>

05:26.353 --> 05:29.899
I see. You just leave a message.
Tell her to call this number.

05:34.779 --> 05:37.907
- What do you say there, Counsellor?
- Save your money.

05:40.785 --> 05:45.080
- What's in the brown paper bag?
- It might be a cabbage head.

05:46.624 --> 05:47.917
But it wouldn't be.

05:48.417 --> 05:50.711
You're a very suspicious man.

05:52.713 --> 05:53.964
True.

05:55.007 --> 05:57.092
I'm everlastingly suspicious of...

05:57.218 --> 05:59.929
...andlor fascinated by...

06:00.554 --> 06:02.848
...the contents of brown paper bags.

06:03.807 --> 06:07.019
- Can I sneak a peek?
- You do that, Counsellor.

06:09.438 --> 06:10.689
You do that.

06:11.857 --> 06:15.486
After you sneak a peek,
why, you uncork whatever you find.

06:23.202 --> 06:24.244
Shall I pour?

06:24.370 --> 06:26.872
- Your privilege.
- My pleasure, sir.

06:37.466 --> 06:42.471
You fought this soldier by yourself.
You've been drinking alone, Pauly.

06:43.263 --> 06:45.015
I don't like that.

06:45.182 --> 06:48.394
Drop the stone, Counsellor.
You live in a glass house.

06:49.019 --> 06:53.190
My windows were busted a long time ago,
so I can say as I please.

06:55.943 --> 06:59.488
- Have an Italian cigar?
- No, thanks.

07:00.072 --> 07:03.826
Those stinkweeds
are another sign of your decadence.

07:07.538 --> 07:09.081
Pauly, it's a fact.

07:09.206 --> 07:12.751
Since Mitch Lodwick beat you out
of the office of public prosecutor...

07:12.835 --> 07:18.048
...you haven't been worth salt for peanuts.
Not that I don't understand how you feel.

07:19.591 --> 07:23.762
A man who gets beat out of an office
he's held for a long time...

07:24.179 --> 07:28.934
...feels his community has deserted him.
The finger of scorn is pointed at him.

07:29.017 --> 07:32.020
None but the lonely hearts
shall know my anguish.

07:32.104 --> 07:35.023
Pauly, you are a good lawyer.
You ought to make like one.

07:35.148 --> 07:37.234
Be here ready for clients, not fishing...

07:37.359 --> 07:39.820
...and playing that rooty-tooty jazz.

07:39.903 --> 07:41.947
I'm making a living.

07:42.239 --> 07:47.202
I run a few abstracts and divorce Jane Doe
from John Doe every once in a while.

07:47.369 --> 07:51.415
Threaten a few deadbeats.
And in the evening I sit around...

07:51.498 --> 07:56.294
...and drink bourbon whiskey and read law
with Parnell Emmitt McCarthy.

07:56.878 --> 07:59.172
One of the world's great men.

07:59.339 --> 08:04.553
That was a kind word, Pauly.
You know, I might have been.

08:05.971 --> 08:10.308
That's one of the reasons I hate to see
your talent pushed aside by lesser men.

08:10.434 --> 08:14.312
I look at you and see myself years ago,
with the same love for the smell...

08:14.396 --> 08:18.150
...of the old brown books in a dusty office.

08:20.193 --> 08:23.321
Here's a rose, a lily...

08:23.864 --> 08:25.991
...a sweet lupine.

08:26.116 --> 08:29.452
<i>The United States Supreme Court Reports.</i>

08:32.289 --> 08:34.582
What shall we read this evening,
Counsellor?

08:34.957 --> 08:37.961
How about a little Chief Justice Holmes?

08:41.673 --> 08:46.219
Restrain Chief Justice Holmes for a minute.
I might have a client. Waiting for a call.

08:46.344 --> 08:48.305
<i>- Hello?
- Mr. Biegler?</i>

08:48.430 --> 08:52.100
This is Paul Biegler speaking.
Hello, Mrs. Manion?

08:52.183 --> 08:54.060
<i>- What?
- Mr. Biegler?</i>

08:54.185 --> 08:56.605
I'm sorry I missed you.
Did you get my message?

08:56.688 --> 08:58.023
Who? What is that name?

08:58.106 --> 09:01.443
Just a minute, please.
We seem to have a bad connection.

09:02.110 --> 09:05.322
It's a woman named Manion.
Maida took a message from her.

09:05.447 --> 09:09.117
In Thunder Bay? If she wants you
to represent her husband, say yes.

09:09.242 --> 09:13.038
- I don't know what it's all about.
- Pretend you do and say yes.

09:13.121 --> 09:14.414
<i>- Hello?
- Mr. Biegler?</i>

09:14.497 --> 09:17.459
This is much better now.
Yes, I can hear you fine.

09:17.834 --> 09:20.420
I waited for your call all afternoon.

09:20.503 --> 09:22.964
<i>Yes, well, I just got in a few moments ago.</i>

09:23.506 --> 09:25.842
You've read about my husband?
Muffy, please.

09:26.134 --> 09:27.177
Yes.

09:27.510 --> 09:31.055
<i>Mr. Biegler,
have you read about my husband?</i>

09:33.308 --> 09:35.310
Yes, I have. A little.

09:35.602 --> 09:37.187
<i>Will you defend him?</i>

09:37.270 --> 09:39.731
I don't know.
I'd have to know more about it.

09:39.814 --> 09:40.982
<i>Will you talk to him?</i>

09:41.191 --> 09:44.110
He's in the county jail.
Will you see him in the morning?

09:44.194 --> 09:47.864
He's very anxious to see you.
You've been so highly recommended.

09:48.573 --> 09:49.824
I have?

09:49.991 --> 09:53.244
<i>Yes, someone told him about you.
Will you see him?</i>

09:53.328 --> 09:55.788
I suppose I could.
I'll see him tomorrow morning.

09:57.290 --> 10:00.335
<i>- Would you want me there, too?
- I think that would be fine.</i>

10:00.627 --> 10:03.171
Let's make it about 10:00.

10:04.088 --> 10:07.008
<i>- Thank you so much.
- You're quite welcome.</i>

10:07.842 --> 10:09.636
What's this all about?

10:09.719 --> 10:12.722
A man named Barney Quill
raped Mrs. Manion.

10:12.805 --> 10:14.933
Her husband is a lieutenant in the Army.

10:15.016 --> 10:17.977
There's a base in Thunder Bay,
gunnery or something.

10:18.102 --> 10:22.940
The lieutenant goes to Quill's place
and plugs Quill about five times...

10:23.066 --> 10:25.735
...which causes Quill
to die of lead poisoning.

10:25.818 --> 10:27.695
- When?
- A couple of nights ago.

10:27.779 --> 10:32.200
If you hadn't been out fishing in some
godforsaken place, you'd have known.

11:47.358 --> 11:48.567
Good morning, Maida.

11:48.693 --> 11:50.319
- There it is.
- What?

11:50.444 --> 11:53.447
The newspaper.
I thought maybe they didn't bring it.

11:53.531 --> 11:56.659
We haven't paid the bill.
Did you get my note?

11:56.951 --> 11:59.412
We may be in the case.
I'm reading up on it now...

11:59.495 --> 12:01.455
...before talking to Lt. Manion.

12:01.539 --> 12:03.290
Doesn't he ever go home?

12:03.374 --> 12:06.335
You mean Parnell?
We were up late last night.

12:06.419 --> 12:07.962
Is that a fact?

12:08.087 --> 12:11.674
I think maybe you'd better cancel
all my appointments for today.

12:11.799 --> 12:15.761
What appointments?
People think you've migrated to the woods.

12:17.138 --> 12:19.348
If this refrigerator gets more fish in it...

12:19.431 --> 12:22.560
...it'll swim upstream
and spawn all by itself.

12:24.562 --> 12:27.690
May I have your attention
for a moment, please?

12:28.691 --> 12:29.650
Yeah.

12:29.775 --> 12:33.946
I went over your cheque-book yesterday.
I can't pay me my salary.

12:34.280 --> 12:36.657
What happened to the fee
for the Walkers' divorce?

12:36.866 --> 12:39.785
Help salt a uranium mine or something?

12:40.202 --> 12:42.329
I bought a few bare necessities.

12:42.454 --> 12:46.625
Like a new outboard motor.
I wish I could be classed as a necessity.

12:47.334 --> 12:50.045
- Aren't you going to have any toast?
- No.

12:50.879 --> 12:54.258
I'll call you.
Let you know how things are going.

12:54.383 --> 12:56.969
Now, don't let him pay you off
in Purple Hearts.

12:57.052 --> 12:59.596
Those professional soldiers
never have a dime.

12:59.680 --> 13:02.016
I ought to know, I was married to one.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.247
Pardon me. Are you Mrs. Manion?

13:25.330 --> 13:27.207
- Hi.
- I'm Paul Biegler.

13:27.833 --> 13:29.918
- I'm Laura.
- How do you do?

13:30.878 --> 13:32.755
- This is Muff.
- Hello, Muff.

13:33.297 --> 13:35.382
The jail's right here.

13:38.177 --> 13:39.845
You're tall!

13:42.848 --> 13:45.559
- Hello, Pauly.
- Hi, Sulo.

13:45.851 --> 13:47.936
You wait here, Muffy.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.651
- Good to see you.
- How're you feeling?

13:54.735 --> 13:57.571
Fine. I guess you've come
for the soldier boy?

13:57.696 --> 14:00.490
Yes. Do you think we could talk
in the sheriff's office?

14:00.574 --> 14:03.493
Sure, I'll bring him down.

14:13.962 --> 14:17.090
Would you mind taking your glasses off,
Mrs. Manion?

14:19.676 --> 14:22.387
Gee-whiz. Barney Quill do that to you?

14:22.638 --> 14:25.766
More than that. You should see. All over.

14:27.934 --> 14:31.480
You can put them back on,
if it's more comfortable for you.

14:39.946 --> 14:42.574
This is Pauly Biegler.
This is the bucko, Pauly.

14:42.657 --> 14:44.034
- Lt. Manion?
- Hello, there.

14:44.159 --> 14:47.079
- Hi, Manny.
- Hello, Laura.

14:49.956 --> 14:54.211
I wonder if you could meet me
down at my office about 2:00 p.m.

14:54.377 --> 14:56.046
It's 305 West Barnham.

14:56.379 --> 14:57.923
- Of course.
- Fine.

14:58.507 --> 15:02.260
- Is there anything I can get you, hon?
- I'm all right, hon.

15:04.805 --> 15:06.348
Right in here.

15:19.778 --> 15:20.987
Wanted: The Big 10.

15:22.906 --> 15:28.119
They got the 10 best-dressed dames,
the 10 top teams, the 10 top tunes...

15:28.828 --> 15:30.664
...and now the 10 most-wanted.

15:30.747 --> 15:32.999
Don't knock it. That's the American dream.

15:33.124 --> 15:35.001
Those boys made the grade.

15:35.210 --> 15:39.839
You were the district attorney around here,
weren't you?

15:39.923 --> 15:41.800
Yes. Ten years.

15:42.384 --> 15:45.095
What's your experience
as a defence lawyer?

15:45.220 --> 15:46.388
Not very much.

15:46.513 --> 15:49.224
How do I know you can handle my case?

15:49.307 --> 15:52.852
I guess you don't know.
Shall we talk about it?

15:54.896 --> 15:56.398
I suppose so.

15:57.607 --> 15:59.651
Come on. Don't be so bored.

15:59.734 --> 16:03.446
You know, it might very well be
that no lawyer can "handle" your case...

16:03.530 --> 16:05.323
...if you mean getting off scot-free.

16:05.740 --> 16:08.993
You seem to be forgetting:
Barney Quill raped my wife.

16:09.077 --> 16:10.829
I have the unwritten law on my side.

16:11.329 --> 16:13.623
The unwritten law is a myth.

16:13.873 --> 16:16.668
There is no such thing
as the unwritten law.

16:16.793 --> 16:19.879
Anyone who commits murder
on the theory it does exist...

16:19.963 --> 16:23.133
...has bought himself room and board
in the state penitentiary.

16:23.216 --> 16:24.884
Maybe for life.

16:26.511 --> 16:31.724
With that in mind, perhaps we can proceed
with a few questions and answers that...

16:33.643 --> 16:35.311
Can I borrow your lighter?

16:38.439 --> 16:40.608
We can proceed with a few questions...

16:40.692 --> 16:44.028
...that might be of some help
in your defence.

16:45.947 --> 16:47.824
But probably won't be.

16:49.784 --> 16:51.869
That's a nice lighter.

16:56.833 --> 16:59.002
- How old are you?
- Twenty-eight.

16:59.085 --> 17:02.171
- How long have you been in the service?
- Since '50.

17:02.839 --> 17:05.174
- Have you seen any action?
- Korea.

17:05.258 --> 17:08.176
- Do you have any decorations?
- Plenty.

17:08.261 --> 17:11.388
- Is this your first marriage?
- No.

17:11.556 --> 17:13.182
You're not on the witness stand.

17:13.266 --> 17:17.436
You don't have to answer yes or no.
Just give me the matrimonial rundown.

17:17.770 --> 17:19.230
Is this necessary?

17:19.896 --> 17:21.773
I'll be the judge of that.

17:23.276 --> 17:26.612
My first wife divorced me.
Charged cruelty.

17:28.364 --> 17:31.701
Eating crackers in bed,
you know, the usual stuff.

17:32.076 --> 17:36.247
The truth was, she found another guy
when I was in Korea.

17:38.541 --> 17:44.380
I met Laura four years ago, in Georgia.
We were married right after her divorce.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.883
Did you know the husband?

17:47.425 --> 17:49.010
He was in my outfit down there.

17:49.093 --> 17:51.179
You mean you were buddies?

17:51.637 --> 17:54.974
I'll withdraw the question.
That's a little old-fashioned.

17:55.057 --> 17:59.020
Have there been any children
by or from any of these marriages?

17:59.186 --> 18:01.981
- No.
- Any present prospects?

18:02.064 --> 18:04.692
Not unless Barney Quill started something.

18:04.775 --> 18:07.028
What kind of a gun did you use on Quill?

18:07.111 --> 18:09.947
War souvenir. Luger.
The police have it now.

18:10.031 --> 18:13.075
I suppose you've read
the newspaper stories about your case?

18:13.200 --> 18:14.327
Some of them.

18:14.410 --> 18:17.121
- Are they substantially correct?
- Yes.

18:17.246 --> 18:20.583
And you didn't see Quill
rape and beat your wife?

18:20.875 --> 18:26.297
No. When she got back to the trailer,
she told me what had happened.

18:26.839 --> 18:29.842
How long was it
before you went to Quill's and killed him?

18:29.925 --> 18:31.802
I don't know exactly. Maybe an hour.

18:31.927 --> 18:33.304
That long?

18:34.388 --> 18:37.892
The newspapers say your wife volunteered
to take a lie-detector test.

18:37.975 --> 18:39.393
Know anything about this?

18:39.518 --> 18:41.353
Only what I read and what she told me.

18:41.437 --> 18:43.981
Do you know
how the lie-detector test turned out?

18:44.065 --> 18:46.400
- They didn't tell her.
- Yes, Sulo?

18:46.525 --> 18:50.488
Pauly, we got lunch served for the jail.
Do you want to eat with us?

18:51.280 --> 18:54.950
- Does your sister still cook for the jail?
- Sure, she cooks.

18:56.702 --> 19:01.582
You give her my compliments, Sulo.
I've got a luncheon date downtown.

19:01.665 --> 19:03.542
- Nice going...
- I'll be back after lunch.

19:05.127 --> 19:08.005
I'm sorry if I offended you a while ago.

19:08.506 --> 19:10.174
No, you're not.

19:11.425 --> 19:12.760
Come on, bucko.

19:16.931 --> 19:19.016
Pass the salt, Pauly.

19:21.352 --> 19:22.603
Thank you.

19:24.146 --> 19:27.149
Did you give the lieutenant
the well-known lecture?

19:27.274 --> 19:30.736
If you mean,
"Did I coach him into a phoney story?" No.

19:31.570 --> 19:36.784
Maybe you're too pure, Paul. Too pure
for the natural impurities of the law.

19:38.452 --> 19:42.498
Could be that you owe the lieutenant
a chance to find a defence.

19:42.623 --> 19:47.419
You might guide him, show him the way
and let him decide if he wants to take it.

19:47.503 --> 19:50.214
- Want some salt?
- No, I'm not ready.

19:50.297 --> 19:54.676
I'm not the right lawyer for this fellow.
He's insolent, hostile.

19:56.428 --> 19:59.515
You don't have to love him,
just defend him.

19:59.723 --> 20:02.643
What's the matter, don't you need a fee?

20:03.352 --> 20:06.730
You know something?
I think you might be a little bit afraid.

20:06.814 --> 20:10.567
- Afraid of what?
- That you might get licked.

20:13.946 --> 20:17.616
You know, there's only one thing
more devious than a Philadelphia lawyer...

20:17.699 --> 20:21.245
...and that's an Irish lawyer. Pass the salt.

20:24.414 --> 20:26.917
Put it down!

20:33.298 --> 20:36.843
- Hello, there.
- I usually answer to the name Paul.

20:37.594 --> 20:39.596
Are we gonna have some more jokes?

20:39.680 --> 20:42.015
Not unless you want to be the comic.

20:43.267 --> 20:46.353
- I brought you some cigarettes.
- Thanks.

20:46.436 --> 20:47.938
- Peace?
- Sure.

20:48.021 --> 20:49.898
Fine. Now, Lieutenant...

20:50.524 --> 20:53.402
...there are four ways I can defend murder.

20:54.069 --> 20:57.531
Number 1: It wasn't murder.
It was suicide or accidental.

20:57.614 --> 21:01.076
Number 2: You didn't do it.
Number 3: You were legally justified.

21:01.159 --> 21:03.286
Like protecting your home or self-defence.

21:03.370 --> 21:05.872
Number 4: The killing was excusable.

21:06.999 --> 21:09.710
Where do I fit into this rosy picture?

21:09.793 --> 21:14.047
I'll tell you where you don't fit.
You don't fit in any of the first three.

21:14.131 --> 21:18.009
Why wouldn't I be legally justified
in killing the man who raped my wife?

21:18.135 --> 21:19.803
The time element.

21:19.886 --> 21:23.932
If you'd caught him in the act, the shooting
might be justified. But you didn't.

21:24.015 --> 21:26.977
You had time to get the police.
You didn't do that, either.

21:27.060 --> 21:30.230
You're guilty of murder,
premeditated and with vengeance.

21:30.313 --> 21:32.524
That's first-degree murder
in any court of law.

21:32.649 --> 21:36.111
- So I should plead guilty?
- When I advise you to cop out, you'll know.

21:36.194 --> 21:38.738
- Cop out?
- That's plead guilty and ask for mercy.

21:38.989 --> 21:42.242
If you're not telling me to cop out,
what are you telling me?

21:42.367 --> 21:44.161
I'm not telling you to do anything.

21:44.286 --> 21:47.747
I just want you to understand
the letter of the law.

21:50.375 --> 21:52.669
- Go on.
- Go on with what?

21:55.255 --> 21:57.757
Whatever it is you're getting at.

22:02.762 --> 22:04.389
You're very bright.

22:05.098 --> 22:08.893
Let's see how really bright you can be.

22:11.980 --> 22:14.899
Well, I'm working at it.

22:16.985 --> 22:21.406
Because your wife was raped, you'll have
a favourable atmosphere in the courtroom.

22:21.489 --> 22:24.284
The sympathy will be with you
if all the facts are true.

22:24.367 --> 22:26.036
What you need is a legal peg...

22:26.161 --> 22:28.997
...so the jury can hang up
their sympathy in your behalf.

22:29.080 --> 22:31.416
- You follow me?
- Yes.

22:32.751 --> 22:35.211
What's your legal excuse, Lieutenant?

22:36.379 --> 22:39.716
What's your legal excuse
for killing Barney Quill?

22:42.177 --> 22:43.928
Not justification, huh?

22:44.721 --> 22:46.389
Not justification.

22:51.269 --> 22:52.771
Excuse.

22:56.399 --> 22:57.692
Just excuse, huh?

23:12.290 --> 23:13.958
What excuses are there?

23:14.626 --> 23:18.171
How should I know?
You're the one that plugged Quill.

23:18.713 --> 23:20.214
I must've been mad.

23:20.673 --> 23:24.218
- How's that?
- I said I must've been mad.

23:28.848 --> 23:30.934
A bad temper's no excuse.

23:33.269 --> 23:36.272
I mean, I must've been crazy.

23:41.277 --> 23:43.571
Am I getting warmer?

23:48.451 --> 23:50.328
Okay, Sulo. I'm going...

23:51.371 --> 23:52.872
Am I getting warmer?

23:53.373 --> 23:56.250
I'll tell you that
after I've talked to your wife.

23:56.334 --> 24:00.088
In the meantime, see if you can remember
just how crazy you were.

24:07.178 --> 24:09.263
Is Mrs. Manion here yet?

24:09.472 --> 24:11.557
She's been waiting quite a while.

24:11.641 --> 24:14.977
She's been through all your albums
from Dixieland to Brubeck.

24:15.061 --> 24:16.646
What do you think of her?

24:16.729 --> 24:21.442
Soft, easy. The kind men
like to take advantage of, and do.

24:22.401 --> 24:23.736
Did you get any money?

24:23.820 --> 24:25.488
- Huh?
- Money.

24:26.822 --> 24:31.911
I haven't decided to take the case yet.
You surprise me, sometimes.

24:32.703 --> 24:34.997
Why? I've been around.

24:35.623 --> 24:36.874
Yeah, well...

24:44.173 --> 24:46.467
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:53.599 --> 24:57.269
I hope you don't mind.
I think we'd better talk.

24:57.937 --> 25:02.108
You're a funny kind of a lawyer.
The music, I mean.

25:02.483 --> 25:04.985
Aren't lawyers supposed to like music?

25:05.236 --> 25:07.321
Not that kind of music.

25:07.655 --> 25:10.991
I guess that settles it.
I'm a funny kind of a lawyer.

25:11.075 --> 25:14.036
Where's your home, Mrs. Manion?
Where'd you go to school?

25:14.120 --> 25:15.705
Where did you grow up?

25:15.788 --> 25:20.334
No place in particular. We moved around.
My father was a boomer.

25:20.418 --> 25:25.005
Construction boomer.
Building dams mostly. Call me Laura.

25:26.507 --> 25:29.427
- Is your family still alive, Laura?
- No.

25:30.010 --> 25:32.304
I have some cigarettes
around here someplace.

25:32.429 --> 25:34.890
- Want a cigarette?
- No, I wanted to offer you one.

25:34.974 --> 25:37.268
- You could light it for me.
- Oh, yes.

25:39.395 --> 25:40.437
Here.

25:41.605 --> 25:44.733
That's just like your husband's, isn't it?

25:46.777 --> 25:50.072
He gave me this because I liked the one
he had. He's like that.

25:50.155 --> 25:51.699
He gives me presents all the time.

25:51.782 --> 25:53.325
You have a happy marriage?

25:54.660 --> 25:55.786
Yes.

25:56.662 --> 25:59.206
What went wrong with the first marriage?

25:59.290 --> 26:02.167
What went wrong
is when I went for Manny.

26:02.710 --> 26:05.754
- That's honest enough.
- It was more than just that.

26:05.838 --> 26:10.301
Like I told you, I grew up on the move,
and Jack, my first husband...

26:10.426 --> 26:11.760
...didn't like to move.

26:11.844 --> 26:14.179
He wouldn't even take a transfer.

26:14.263 --> 26:18.892
I was really bored. Manny likes to go.
We're always going.

26:18.976 --> 26:21.603
Whenever we get the chance.
We've been all over.

26:21.687 --> 26:22.896
I'm thirsty.

26:23.522 --> 26:25.149
Water? Or would a beer do?

26:25.232 --> 26:27.151
I think a beer would do fine.

26:28.068 --> 26:30.654
Bring me a bottle of beer, will you?

26:32.322 --> 26:34.700
- Are you married?
- No.

26:35.701 --> 26:37.161
That's nice.

26:38.203 --> 26:41.206
What do you do alone in this house
if you aren't married?

26:41.290 --> 26:43.792
It's a family home.
I'm the last of the family...

26:43.876 --> 26:45.627
- There you are.
- Thank you.

26:47.296 --> 26:50.674
- Aren't you having one?
- No, not right now.

26:51.508 --> 26:52.759
There you are.

26:53.427 --> 26:56.597
Could Muff have a little?
In that ashtray, maybe? He loves beer.

26:56.847 --> 26:59.725
You want a beer for the dog?

27:00.559 --> 27:02.227
Well, here we are.

27:06.899 --> 27:08.775
He'll go to sleep now.

27:12.112 --> 27:13.780
- Isn't he cute?
- Yeah.

27:14.698 --> 27:17.409
Well, how about it? Are you ready?

27:18.619 --> 27:21.538
I mean, are you ready to tell me the story?

27:21.830 --> 27:23.707
I know what you mean.

27:25.083 --> 27:28.337
Suppose you tell me
everything you told the state police...

27:28.462 --> 27:32.007
...plus, everything you didn't tell
the state police.

27:32.507 --> 27:34.009
Where shall I begin?

27:34.134 --> 27:36.845
What time did you leave for Quill's bar?

27:37.095 --> 27:40.015
Right after dinner. About 8:30, I guess.

27:40.140 --> 27:44.061
Manny was late getting home
from the firing range. So, we had dinner.

27:44.186 --> 27:45.812
He laid down and went to sleep.

27:45.896 --> 27:50.192
I hadn't been out of the trailer all day,
so I took Muff and a flashlight...

27:50.275 --> 27:51.818
...and walked over to the bar.

27:51.902 --> 27:54.321
I bought a drink
and played the pinball machine.

27:54.404 --> 27:56.490
Many people in the bar?

27:56.948 --> 28:01.745
Not many. Barney came over
and challenged me to a game. For drinks.

28:01.953 --> 28:03.914
How well did you know Barney?

28:03.997 --> 28:07.459
He owned this bar where Manny and I went
sometimes, that's all.

28:07.918 --> 28:11.838
- Had he ever made a pass at you?
- No, nothing like that at all.

28:12.255 --> 28:14.591
Was he drinking heavily that night?

28:15.550 --> 28:18.887
He didn't seem to be.
At least, not when we were playing pinball.

28:19.012 --> 28:21.640
Were you with him
the whole time you were there?

28:21.765 --> 28:23.767
No, there were other people playing.

28:23.850 --> 28:26.353
What time did you leave the bar?

28:26.895 --> 28:28.647
About 11:00, I guess.

28:29.898 --> 28:32.984
I left by the side door.
Muff was carrying the flashlight.

28:33.068 --> 28:34.611
He carries it in his mouth.

28:34.736 --> 28:37.155
He's so cute,
running along with the light shining.

28:37.239 --> 28:38.406
Was he sober?

28:38.490 --> 28:41.910
Muff? Of course he was sober.
You're joking now, aren't you?

28:42.327 --> 28:45.038
Yes, I'm joking. Go on.

28:45.789 --> 28:49.542
Well, Barney came from somewhere,
not the door I left by.

28:49.834 --> 28:53.004
He said he was going my way
and he could drive me home.

28:53.088 --> 28:56.800
He said the bears were prowling around
and I oughtn't to walk home.

28:57.008 --> 28:59.386
The bears come out at night to scavenge.

28:59.469 --> 29:01.388
They're harmless enough, aren't they?

29:01.471 --> 29:04.641
I suppose I wouldn't have been afraid
in the daylight, but...

29:04.724 --> 29:06.267
...the dark isn't the same.

29:06.393 --> 29:09.062
Yes, I know.
Now, you got into Barney's car...

29:09.270 --> 29:11.564
I got in and he drove to the trailer park.

29:11.898 --> 29:13.566
He made overtures?

29:13.900 --> 29:15.026
No, nothing.

29:15.110 --> 29:18.071
When we got to the trailer park,
the auto-gate was closed.

29:18.196 --> 29:21.741
Mr. Lemon closes it about 11:00,
or a little after.

29:21.825 --> 29:24.619
I thanked Barney
and started to get out of the car...

29:24.702 --> 29:27.413
...but he said
there wasn't any need for me to walk.

29:27.539 --> 29:30.416
That he could drive me into the park
on another road.

29:30.500 --> 29:33.837
I didn't know there was another road,
but he drove on...

29:33.962 --> 29:35.880
...before I could say yes or no.

29:35.964 --> 29:40.301
- Were you alarmed?
- No, I'm not usually afraid of men.

29:40.385 --> 29:43.847
And anyway, he hadn't touched me
or even said anything out of the way.

29:44.722 --> 29:49.352
Doesn't a woman sort of instinctively know
when a fellow's on the make?

29:49.852 --> 29:54.148
Sure, but that's only usual with me,
with almost all men.

29:54.232 --> 29:58.236
Ever since I was a kid.
You, for instance. You're interested.

29:58.695 --> 30:02.740
But there isn't any reason to be afraid
of you. It was like that with Barney.

30:02.865 --> 30:05.368
Mrs. Manion, believe me,
I'm not in the least...

30:05.451 --> 30:07.120
Call me Laura.

30:08.871 --> 30:13.710
Laura, I'm only interested in helping
your husband. Nothing more.

30:14.168 --> 30:16.337
I don't mean you'd try anything.

30:16.421 --> 30:19.757
I just mean, it's the way you look at me.

30:21.718 --> 30:24.095
It would be very difficult
not to look at you.

30:24.303 --> 30:26.931
The way I dress, you mean?
You don't like it?

30:27.098 --> 30:29.851
I love it. I just love it.

30:30.977 --> 30:33.980
We'd better keep moving along
with this thing.

30:36.232 --> 30:38.025
How were you dressed that night?

30:38.526 --> 30:40.945
In a sweater, like this, and a skirt.

30:41.154 --> 30:43.489
And the rest? What about that?

30:43.698 --> 30:47.452
Underneath? I had on a slip
and panties and a bra.

30:48.244 --> 30:49.495
No girdle?

30:49.579 --> 30:52.582
I don't need a girdle.
Do you think I need a girdle?

30:53.207 --> 30:56.335
I don't know. How should...

30:57.336 --> 31:01.924
I'm only concerned with the few facts
that might be of help to me...

31:02.008 --> 31:04.218
...to defend your husband. That's all.

31:04.302 --> 31:06.762
- Well, I don't wear one.
- Okay, no girdle.

31:08.014 --> 31:09.640
All right. Now, go on.

31:09.765 --> 31:14.186
He turned off the highway into a lane
in the woods, and he stopped the car...

31:14.312 --> 31:16.105
...and turned off the lights.

31:16.230 --> 31:20.901
And then he grabbed me and he said,
"I'm gonna rape you." Just like that.

31:20.985 --> 31:22.028
He used those words?

31:22.111 --> 31:26.699
Exactly those words. Muff began to bark,
so he threw him out the window.

31:26.782 --> 31:30.453
I could hear little Muffy whining
outside the car, all through it.

31:30.578 --> 31:35.458
Barney began to try to get at me
and I fought him off as best I could.

31:35.541 --> 31:37.126
But he was terribly strong.

31:37.209 --> 31:39.211
Did you cry out? Did you scream?

31:39.587 --> 31:42.214
Didn't seem to be much use,
out there in the woods.

31:42.340 --> 31:47.178
He began to shout names at me
like "army slut" and some other names.

31:47.303 --> 31:49.930
Then, he drew back
and hit me with his fist.

31:50.014 --> 31:52.933
He hit me again and I didn't fight anymore.

31:53.017 --> 31:55.895
I must've been only half-conscious...

31:56.771 --> 32:00.274
...but I know that he tore my panties off
and did what he wanted.

32:01.317 --> 32:03.569
The newspapers said
a doctor examined you...

32:03.652 --> 32:05.738
...and he didn't think you'd been raped.

32:05.821 --> 32:09.533
I don't care what the doctor thought,
a woman doesn't mistake these things.

32:09.617 --> 32:12.286
All right. Go ahead.

32:15.748 --> 32:19.251
I don't know exactly what happened then,
I must've fainted.

32:19.335 --> 32:21.462
The next thing I remember,
the car was moving.

32:21.545 --> 32:26.133
Barney was driving very fast
and he was breathing hard.

32:26.842 --> 32:29.136
An ugly, gasping sound.

32:30.262 --> 32:32.765
We were on the main road
to the trailer park...

32:32.848 --> 32:35.601
...and he swung in by the gate
and stopped.

32:35.684 --> 32:37.228
I opened the door to get out.

32:37.353 --> 32:40.064
Muffy jumped out
with a lighted flashlight in his mouth.

32:40.147 --> 32:41.315
Wait a minute.

32:41.440 --> 32:44.693
You said he'd thrown Muff out of the car,
back in the woods.

32:45.027 --> 32:49.281
He did, but he must've let him back in.
I don't remember.

32:49.657 --> 32:52.576
All right. You opened the door
and Muff got out first.

32:53.202 --> 32:56.497
Before I could get out, Barney grabbed me
and said he was gonna...

32:56.622 --> 32:58.999
...tear all my clothes off
and attack me again.

32:59.124 --> 33:00.334
I got away and ran.

33:00.459 --> 33:02.586
I could see Muff at an opening in the fence.

33:02.670 --> 33:05.881
He was scooting back and forth
with the flashlight.

33:06.090 --> 33:10.052
Barney caught me from behind
and I fell to the ground.

33:10.135 --> 33:13.013
He fell on top of me
and began to beat me with his fists.

33:13.097 --> 33:14.890
I thought he was gonna kill me.

33:15.015 --> 33:19.186
I screamed and somehow
I got to my feet again and ran.

33:19.394 --> 33:22.439
I went through the opening in the fence,
followed Muffy...

33:22.523 --> 33:24.858
...who was running ahead
with the flashlight.

33:24.942 --> 33:27.736
I kept following the light
until he led me to our trailer.

33:27.945 --> 33:29.988
And you didn't see Barney again?

33:30.072 --> 33:33.200
I never laid eyes on him again,
dead or alive.

33:34.451 --> 33:37.454
I think that's enough for now.

33:38.622 --> 33:40.999
I've got lots of time. All you want.

33:42.584 --> 33:43.961
Where can I reach you?

33:44.086 --> 33:47.881
I'm still in Thunder Bay,
but I can drive down again in the morning.

33:51.218 --> 33:54.137
- Was there something else?
- No.

34:06.608 --> 34:10.696
- Thanks for letting me play the records.
- You're very welcome.

34:14.741 --> 34:18.078
- Who was that?
- The lady in the case.

34:21.581 --> 34:23.458
You're not gonna take the case?

34:23.542 --> 34:27.212
I don't know. That depends on
what Manion has to tell me tomorrow.

34:27.295 --> 34:29.380
He's thinking things out.

34:30.297 --> 34:32.134
That's more like it.

34:33.009 --> 34:35.887
If I take the case, I'll want you in it.

34:36.179 --> 34:38.681
Me? In a big murder case?

34:40.475 --> 34:45.021
The sight of this whiskey-drinking old man
at the counsel table would ruin you.

34:45.105 --> 34:46.565
I need you.

34:47.607 --> 34:49.150
You mean that?

34:49.525 --> 34:51.610
Why else would he say it?

34:52.612 --> 34:56.992
I'll be glad to work with you outside
the courtroom, but not in the courtroom.

34:57.200 --> 34:58.910
You suit yourself about that.

34:59.035 --> 35:02.789
Either way, I'm gonna have to be able
to depend on you.

35:03.790 --> 35:06.084
Will you lay off the booze?

35:13.466 --> 35:15.510
I don't know about that.

35:15.677 --> 35:17.470
Why don't you know?

35:20.015 --> 35:22.934
Do you think I could lay off the booze?

35:23.560 --> 35:25.520
Have you ever tried it?

35:27.939 --> 35:29.190
Try it.

35:33.737 --> 35:38.325
I've never been in a big murder case.
Not once in all my life.

35:39.701 --> 35:41.453
Well, it's up to you, Parn.

35:48.793 --> 35:50.587
Will you be around tonight?

35:53.256 --> 35:55.550
Yeah, I'll be around.

36:03.725 --> 36:07.479
Maida, darling, I might manage it.

36:09.522 --> 36:12.192
I might manage to be a real lawyer again...

36:13.651 --> 36:15.612
...for a little while, anyway.

36:19.032 --> 36:23.077
I tried remembering.
There were still some pieces missing.

36:25.330 --> 36:27.248
I remember...

36:28.666 --> 36:31.169
...going to Quill's bar with a gun.

36:32.420 --> 36:35.548
And I remember Quill's face
behind the bar...

36:36.716 --> 36:40.136
...but I don't remember anything else.
Not even going home.

36:40.219 --> 36:42.263
Don't you remember firing the gun?

36:42.347 --> 36:44.515
Five shots. That's a lot of noise to forget.

36:44.599 --> 36:48.561
I remember hearing shots,
but they don't seem connected with me.

36:48.686 --> 36:53.274
They seemed far away, like somebody else
was doing the shooting.

36:58.237 --> 37:01.574
Lt. Manion, I'll take your case.

37:02.658 --> 37:05.411
Thanks, Mr. Biegler.

37:05.536 --> 37:07.789
There's the little matter of the fee.

37:07.955 --> 37:10.833
$3,000. That's reasonable enough, isn't it?

37:10.958 --> 37:12.293
More than reasonable.

37:12.376 --> 37:13.920
I'll pay you later. I'm broke.

37:14.045 --> 37:16.672
- You're what?
- I'm flat busted.

37:16.756 --> 37:19.050
I don't have $3, much less $3,000.

37:19.133 --> 37:20.468
Can you raise it?

37:20.551 --> 37:22.845
Yeah, as soon as I get out of jail.

37:24.514 --> 37:29.310
Next week's payday,
I'll be able to give you $150.

37:29.393 --> 37:32.563
If you get me off,
I'll give you a promissory note for the rest.

37:32.647 --> 37:36.817
Suppose I don't go along with you
unless you pay me half the fee?

37:37.443 --> 37:41.739
I'll have to take a lawyer
the court appoints. I got my defence now.

37:41.822 --> 37:43.699
Right? Insanity?

37:44.033 --> 37:46.869
I think I'll stick around
and make damn sure you get off.

37:46.953 --> 37:50.706
- Where do we start?
- We're gonna need a psychiatrist.

37:51.374 --> 37:53.084
As neither one of us has money...

37:53.209 --> 37:55.920
...do you think
the Army'll stir one up for you?

37:56.003 --> 37:58.256
I know a colonel in the Pentagon. I'll write.

37:58.339 --> 37:59.715
Good, do that. Sulo?

38:05.805 --> 38:07.306
Where are you going now?

38:07.390 --> 38:09.892
I'm going to see your wife, for one thing.

38:10.101 --> 38:12.269
Why? Didn't you see her yesterday?

38:12.395 --> 38:16.190
That's right, I did.
She's a very pretty woman, your wife.

38:17.233 --> 38:19.276
A man gets used to the way his wife looks.

38:19.402 --> 38:22.321
Yeah, I guess he does. I'll see you.

38:40.131 --> 38:42.007
Come on in, Pauly.

38:42.508 --> 38:45.469
You haven't been in here
since you vacated.

38:45.553 --> 38:48.430
Hardly recognise the old place?
Mary did it for me.

38:48.639 --> 38:51.976
She just finished a decorator's course.
Smart girl.

38:52.059 --> 38:55.813
- Look at this, a real genuine Picasso print.
- Very nice.

38:56.105 --> 38:59.108
Try this chair.
It sort of does things for you.

38:59.191 --> 39:01.360
Here, sit right down.

39:02.319 --> 39:04.613
Great, isn't it?
"Good for the nerves," they say.

39:04.780 --> 39:06.740
How do you shut it off?

39:06.824 --> 39:09.285
Here we are. Feel better?

39:09.410 --> 39:11.245
I feel all shook up.

39:13.664 --> 39:17.334
I just dropped by to tell you
I've got both feet in the Manion case.

39:17.418 --> 39:19.587
- You're going to cop out, aren't you?
- No.

39:19.712 --> 39:21.797
That's a mistake. It's open and shut.

39:22.006 --> 39:23.424
Maybe. We'll see.

39:23.549 --> 39:25.050
Judge Maitland's in the hospital.

39:25.175 --> 39:27.970
Maybe you'd like a continuance
until he gets back.

39:28.053 --> 39:29.888
If we go now, we'll have to try...

39:29.972 --> 39:32.391
...before some grab-bag judge
they'll send in.

39:32.474 --> 39:35.060
- I'd rather have Maitland.
- Yeah, so would I.

39:35.144 --> 39:39.106
But, of course, that also means my client
lies around in jail another two...

39:39.189 --> 39:41.316
...or three months before the trial.

39:41.942 --> 39:44.194
If you drop the charge
down to manslaughter...

39:44.319 --> 39:47.197
...so he can get out on bail,
we'll agree to a continuance.

39:47.281 --> 39:49.742
You wouldn't do that if you were still D.A.

39:49.825 --> 39:51.702
I don't know, I might.

39:52.202 --> 39:55.998
I might, since a big fat lie-detector test
on his wife has given proof...

39:56.081 --> 39:58.667
...to the rape story.
The jury'll be with him.

39:58.751 --> 40:00.836
How did you know what the lie...

40:01.420 --> 40:03.088
- Bit, didn't I?
- Yeah, you did.

40:03.172 --> 40:05.757
A lie-detector test
isn't admissible evidence.

40:05.841 --> 40:07.009
You can't use it.

40:07.092 --> 40:13.015
No, but it carries moral weight.
I wouldn't sit in that chair too much.

40:13.098 --> 40:16.852
It could shake a fellow's brains loose.
I'll see you later.

40:26.403 --> 40:28.363
He remembers you, Paul. He likes you.

40:28.447 --> 40:32.826
He likes the beer in my icebox.
What's the occasion today, a buffalo hunt?

40:32.910 --> 40:36.163
No, I bought these in Arizona
when we were stationed there.

40:36.288 --> 40:37.998
Aren't they smart?

40:38.081 --> 40:39.916
We can sit in my car.

40:47.257 --> 40:48.467
Here you are.

40:52.012 --> 40:54.306
Several things have occurred to me.

40:56.558 --> 41:00.020
The undergarments
that Barney Quill tore off:

41:00.103 --> 41:02.439
Who has them now? The police?

41:02.606 --> 41:04.483
You mean my panties?

41:04.775 --> 41:06.651
All right, your panties.

41:06.777 --> 41:08.278
I haven't seen them since.

41:08.361 --> 41:11.239
I gave the torn skirt and sweater
to the police.

41:11.323 --> 41:14.576
Then I went with them into the woods
to look for the panties...

41:14.659 --> 41:17.037
...but we couldn't find anything
but my glasses.

41:17.120 --> 41:18.455
Your glasses!

41:18.580 --> 41:21.458
You mean,
you were wearing glasses through all that?

41:21.666 --> 41:23.376
I had them in a case in my hand.

41:23.502 --> 41:26.379
I wear them for reading,
playing pinball, things like that.

41:26.463 --> 41:30.091
I must've tried to get out of the car
and dropped them.

41:30.884 --> 41:35.055
You might be interested to know
that your lie-detector test turned out...

41:35.180 --> 41:36.932
...in your favour.

41:37.015 --> 41:39.559
Of course it did.
I could've told you it would.

41:39.643 --> 41:41.353
You weren't worried about it?

41:41.436 --> 41:43.521
No, why should I be?

41:45.232 --> 41:48.401
Would you like to have something
to worry about?

41:48.485 --> 41:49.736
Silly.

41:49.819 --> 41:53.365
Like your husband watching us
from his cell window?

41:57.911 --> 41:59.788
All right, let's have it.

42:00.747 --> 42:02.332
Did he say something to you?

42:02.415 --> 42:05.335
Just enough. Are you afraid of him?

42:06.711 --> 42:07.963
Yes.

42:08.505 --> 42:11.591
Is that why you volunteered
for a lie-detector test? For him?

42:11.716 --> 42:12.759
Yeah.

42:13.593 --> 42:16.304
Does he have reason to be jealous?

42:16.971 --> 42:19.140
He was jealous
even before we were married.

42:19.265 --> 42:21.768
I should've known how it would be.

42:22.018 --> 42:24.771
It's funny, though.
He likes to show me off.

42:24.854 --> 42:28.066
He likes me to dress the way I do,
and then he gets furious...

42:28.149 --> 42:33.154
...if a man pays any attention to me.
I've tried to leave him, but I can't.

42:33.321 --> 42:35.198
He begs, I give in.

42:36.449 --> 42:40.203
Now, if you think
I've forgotten my question, I haven't.

42:40.995 --> 42:42.455
I have.

42:43.164 --> 42:48.169
Then I'll ask it again. Does your husband
have any reason to be jealous?

42:50.171 --> 42:52.674
No. Not once.

42:53.174 --> 42:54.676
Not ever.

45:13.647 --> 45:14.982
Like the place all right?

45:15.065 --> 45:18.736
I was just looking at those pictures.
That was Barney Quill, wasn't it?

45:18.819 --> 45:22.031
- That's right. Barney Quill.
- I'm Paul Biegler...

45:22.114 --> 45:25.451
I know who you are.
I've seen you around Iron City.

45:25.784 --> 45:27.495
You didn't tell me your name.

45:27.578 --> 45:29.997
Paquette. We don't open till 5:00.

45:30.080 --> 45:33.834
That's all right. I can wait.
I don't have the shakes yet.

45:34.585 --> 45:37.171
You were on the job that night,
weren't you?

45:37.296 --> 45:39.215
The night Barney Quill was killed.

45:39.298 --> 45:41.634
Like the newspaper said, I was present.

45:41.717 --> 45:45.221
You were the fellow
that stopped Lt. Manion outside.

45:45.304 --> 45:46.430
That's right.

45:46.597 --> 45:50.392
He pointed the gun at me and said,
"You want some too, buster?"

45:50.476 --> 45:53.812
And you said no,
because your name isn't Buster.

45:53.896 --> 45:55.522
Wasn't anything funny about it.

45:55.648 --> 45:58.567
No, there wasn't anything... I'm sorry.

45:58.859 --> 46:01.612
Where were you
when Barney Quill was killed?

46:05.157 --> 46:07.993
I gather you don't want to talk
about that night?

46:08.077 --> 46:10.329
That's right. I don't want to talk about it.

46:10.412 --> 46:13.749
You'll have to talk to me about it in court,
why not now?

46:13.916 --> 46:16.710
'Cause I don't have to now.
Reason enough, okay?

46:16.794 --> 46:17.836
Okay.

46:20.839 --> 46:23.717
Old Barney, he was
kind of a rugged character, wasn't he?

46:23.842 --> 46:27.554
Ex-prize fighter and muscleman,
and fancy with guns.

46:28.222 --> 46:31.975
He paid his debts, ran a clean place.
Me, I liked him.

46:32.101 --> 46:33.602
You run the place now?

46:33.685 --> 46:36.814
No, I just work here.
Mary's running things.

46:37.272 --> 46:39.483
Mary? Was that Barney's wife?

46:39.566 --> 46:42.569
No. He didn't have a wife.
Mary was his manager.

46:44.279 --> 46:46.698
I wonder who's going to inherit the place.

46:46.782 --> 46:49.993
- Mary, I guess.
- Mary again, huh?

46:50.202 --> 46:51.745
What's the matter with that?

46:51.829 --> 46:55.749
You mean, what's the matter with Mary?
I don't know.

46:55.832 --> 46:57.084
Mary what?

46:57.584 --> 46:59.127
Pilant. Mary Pilant.

46:59.253 --> 47:01.004
She's in the back booth.

47:01.088 --> 47:05.801
We don't talk about our customers here,
but if we did, which we don't...

47:07.719 --> 47:10.222
That's her. That's Mary Pilant.

47:19.314 --> 47:21.274
Do you know Lt. Manion's wife?

47:21.358 --> 47:24.987
Sure. I know the lieutenant, too.
He's a good officer.

47:25.445 --> 47:28.532
She's all right, too. Friendly, a good kid.

47:29.116 --> 47:32.828
- What do you know? Knock it off.
- I didn't mean anything. She's a dish.

47:32.911 --> 47:34.204
What's wrong with that?

47:34.287 --> 47:39.501
You want this lawyer to get wrong ideas?
What chances has the lieutenant got?

47:40.043 --> 47:43.839
Pretty good, I'd say, with a couple
of character witnesses like you.

47:45.215 --> 47:48.385
I'd like to help him out,
I sure would, but we're moving out.

47:48.468 --> 47:50.595
The whole outfit. Berlin.

47:52.347 --> 47:55.475
Tell me, who is this "babe" at the hotel?

47:56.017 --> 48:00.188
Her name is Mary Pilant.
She was Quill's private property.

48:13.368 --> 48:16.079
- Would you like a table, sir?
- Yes, please.

48:22.127 --> 48:23.295
Will you be alone?

48:23.378 --> 48:25.672
No, I'll be joined by two others.

48:25.964 --> 48:29.217
- May I take your hat?
- Thank you very much.

48:36.933 --> 48:38.143
How was the manicure?

48:38.226 --> 48:41.604
Ask me any questions about anybody.
I've got all the dope.

48:41.688 --> 48:44.899
Can you tell me about a woman
by the name of Mary Pilant?

48:45.025 --> 48:48.737
Easy. Mary Pilant may
or may not have been...

48:48.820 --> 48:51.072
...the mistress of the late B. Quill.

48:51.156 --> 48:53.825
The manicurist is in favour
of the mistress theory...

48:53.908 --> 48:55.744
...but the hairdresser is against it.

48:55.827 --> 49:00.707
However, they both agree that some kind
of hanky-panky must've been going on.

49:00.832 --> 49:02.083
To be continued.

49:02.167 --> 49:04.044
- Menu?
- Thank you.

49:06.337 --> 49:09.674
- Pretty, huh?
- Yes, very pretty. Well, go on.

49:10.675 --> 49:15.513
There's one story that says that Barney's
wild night with Mrs. Manion was...

49:15.597 --> 49:18.433
...somehow triggered by Mary Pilant.

49:18.558 --> 49:22.312
Seemed she'd been seeing some soldier
and Barney blew his stack.

49:22.395 --> 49:24.105
He got tanked up and exploded.

49:24.189 --> 49:27.275
- Is Mary Pilant local?
- No, she's a Canadian.

49:27.358 --> 49:29.486
Barney brought her in
to dress up the place...

49:29.569 --> 49:33.489
...and she stayed on to manage it for him.
Looks like she's done all right.

49:33.573 --> 49:36.367
It's better than all right.
She's in for the estate.

49:37.577 --> 49:40.914
She doesn't look like a bad sort, does she?

49:41.122 --> 49:42.165
Where?

49:42.248 --> 49:45.668
What do you mean, "where"?
The pretty one with the menus.

49:45.752 --> 49:47.670
This girl, right here?

49:52.675 --> 49:55.637
Miss Pilant, may I introduce myself?

49:55.762 --> 49:58.264
I'm Paul Biegler, attorney for Lt. Manion.

49:58.348 --> 50:01.351
This is Mrs. Rutledge and Mr. McCarthy,
my associates.

50:01.434 --> 50:03.311
Could you sit with us for a minute?

50:03.394 --> 50:05.688
- Yes, I can take a minute.
- Thank you.

50:07.565 --> 50:11.110
I'd like to ask you a few things,
if you don't mind.

50:11.361 --> 50:13.863
What sort of things, Mr. Biegler?

50:14.030 --> 50:17.075
Like, what kind of man your employer was?

50:17.158 --> 50:18.493
A very nice man.

50:18.618 --> 50:22.205
If that's true, how do you explain
what happened with Lt. Manion's wife?

50:22.789 --> 50:25.500
I don't know what happened
with Lt. Manion's wife...

50:25.625 --> 50:28.169
...so there isn't anything for me to explain.

50:28.252 --> 50:31.339
Your loyalty to the dead Mr. Quill
is very touching.

50:31.506 --> 50:34.300
Barney was well-liked here by everyone,
Mr. Biegler.

50:34.383 --> 50:38.596
It's very generous to overlook his little
faults, like raping other men's wives.

50:40.097 --> 50:41.933
If you will pardon me.

50:42.016 --> 50:44.727
The waitress will take your order
when you're ready.

50:44.852 --> 50:49.232
Nice to have met you,
Mr. Biegler, Mr. McCarthy, Mrs. Rutledge.

50:51.609 --> 50:54.111
You've just been ginned, Lieutenant.

50:57.240 --> 50:58.491
Manion?

51:02.662 --> 51:07.166
- Any word, Lieutenant?
- Yeah, this. From Washington.

51:07.583 --> 51:10.836
They'll let a doctor come to testify,
but there's a string on it.

51:10.962 --> 51:14.715
They want me to go to an army hospital
in Detroit for an examination.

51:14.799 --> 51:18.260
Doesn't the Army understand
you're in jail on a non-bailable offence?

51:18.344 --> 51:20.638
That's it, as far as the Army's concerned.

51:20.805 --> 51:24.350
I don't know how I can get around this.
I'll try to think of something.

51:24.433 --> 51:26.352
My wife hasn't been here for two days.

51:26.435 --> 51:28.771
- Have you seen her?
- No. Not for a while.

51:28.854 --> 51:32.274
- Where the hell is she?
- You've got other things to worry about.

51:32.358 --> 51:35.194
I'll get in touch with her
and tell her you miss her.

51:35.277 --> 51:37.571
Yeah, you tell her that.

51:38.406 --> 51:40.866
- Thanks, Sulo.
- Okay, Pauly.

51:44.745 --> 51:47.248
I know just how you feel, Lieutenant.

51:47.373 --> 51:51.710
I'd be tearing my hair out, too,
if I had something like that outside.

51:52.503 --> 51:54.839
Something like what outside?

51:54.922 --> 52:00.136
You know what I mean. Something
like that running around on the loose.

52:05.850 --> 52:08.352
Now, what's the big noise, buckos?

52:09.103 --> 52:13.274
It's me, dummy.
I hit my elbow on this lousy iron bar.

52:13.732 --> 52:16.402
You want some rubbing alcohol, maybe?

52:16.485 --> 52:19.113
No, but a little bourbon might help.

52:20.698 --> 52:23.367
Knock it off, buckos!

52:23.617 --> 52:25.911
Let's finish the game, Lieutenant.

52:56.150 --> 53:00.279
Hey, what a crazy lawyer we got!
Hi, Pauly.

53:00.362 --> 53:05.993
That's what they call you, isn't it? Pauly?
That's a crazy name for a crazy lawyer.

53:14.501 --> 53:18.505
- Thanks for letting me sit in, Pie-Eye.
- You're not splitting the scene, man?

53:18.630 --> 53:21.717
- I mean, you're not cutting out?
- No, I'll be back.

53:40.944 --> 53:43.906
Hi, Pauly. Fellas, this is Manny's lawyer.

53:44.698 --> 53:46.950
- Sit down, won't you?
- Sorry, I can't right now.

53:47.075 --> 53:50.329
Mrs. Manion, may I talk to you
for a moment outside?

53:50.454 --> 53:53.999
Mrs. Manion? I thought we dropped
the formalities a long time ago.

53:54.082 --> 53:56.918
We'd better pick them up again.
This is important.

53:57.002 --> 53:59.504
- All right, I'll go with you.
- All right, come on.

53:59.588 --> 54:04.176
- You're coming back, aren't you?
- Sure, what do you think?

54:13.352 --> 54:16.480
- See you later, Pie-Eye.
- Okay.

54:24.571 --> 54:26.281
Did you get my phone message?

54:26.406 --> 54:27.949
Yeah, but I got busy.

54:28.033 --> 54:29.951
Why haven't you been to see
your husband?

54:30.035 --> 54:31.995
I don't see why I have to go every day.

54:32.078 --> 54:34.456
It would be a very good idea if you did.

54:34.539 --> 54:36.750
All right. I'll see him every day.

54:36.875 --> 54:38.043
- Okay?
- No, it's not okay.

54:38.126 --> 54:40.045
- Where's your car?
- I came with them.

54:40.128 --> 54:43.340
- Mine's right over here.
- Now wait, I got friends inside.

54:43.423 --> 54:45.217
Friends or not, you're going home.

54:45.300 --> 54:46.384
Who do you think you are?

54:46.510 --> 54:49.387
I'm the lawyer trying to save your husband.
Remember?

54:49.471 --> 54:52.390
- What's that got to do with...
- You listen to me!

54:52.516 --> 54:55.685
Until this is over, you're going to be
a meek little housewife...

54:55.810 --> 54:57.479
...with horn-rimmed spectacles.

54:57.562 --> 55:02.776
You're going to stay away from men,
juke joints, booze and pinball machines.

55:02.859 --> 55:05.528
You're gonna wear a skirt
and low-heeled shoes.

55:05.612 --> 55:08.240
And you're gonna wear a girdle.
Especially a girdle.

55:08.323 --> 55:12.077
Believe me. I don't usually complain
of an attractive jiggle...

55:12.160 --> 55:15.413
...but you save that jiggle
for your husband to look at...

55:15.497 --> 55:19.334
...if and when I get him out of jail.
Now, come on. Let's go.

55:20.293 --> 55:22.003
I'm sorry. I really am.

55:22.087 --> 55:24.506
I wouldn't hurt Manny's chances
for anything.

55:24.589 --> 55:25.840
Come on.

56:04.504 --> 56:06.965
Is this about where
Barney knocked you down?

56:07.090 --> 56:08.800
Yeah. Right over here.

56:09.008 --> 56:11.553
Over there's the opening in the fence
where Muffy...

56:11.636 --> 56:14.556
...was running back and forth
with the flashlight.

56:16.808 --> 56:18.685
Where's your trailer?

56:19.227 --> 56:20.979
Up there on the hill.

56:27.026 --> 56:28.903
This is my favourite place.

56:33.992 --> 56:37.745
Sometimes when Manny was sleeping,
I'd come out here and just sit.

56:37.912 --> 56:39.455
I had to get out of that trailer.

56:39.539 --> 56:42.458
I couldn't stand
being cooped up all the time.

56:45.670 --> 56:48.589
I'm lonely, Paul. I'm awful lonely.

56:49.507 --> 56:53.052
I wouldn't have gone to that roadhouse
if it weren't for that.

56:53.344 --> 56:56.889
Maybe you're getting in
some good practise for being lonely.

56:57.473 --> 56:59.684
You think maybe Manny won't get off?

56:59.767 --> 57:02.895
That'll be up to the jury
and you never can tell about them.

57:02.979 --> 57:05.481
If he didn't, it'd be one way to end it.

57:06.149 --> 57:07.817
No, I don't mean that.

57:08.568 --> 57:12.113
I may think it sometimes,
but I don't really want it.

57:25.585 --> 57:29.964
Hello, sweetie. Did you miss me?
Of course you missed me.

57:33.259 --> 57:37.221
You want to come in, Paul?
You can if you want to, you know.

57:39.307 --> 57:41.183
No, thank you, Laura.

57:41.726 --> 57:45.062
I'm sorry I had to spoil your fun
over at that place.

57:47.064 --> 57:49.775
- Good night, Laura.
- Good night.

58:18.220 --> 58:20.347
Hear ye, hear ye.

58:20.431 --> 58:24.810
The Circuit Court for the County
of Iron Cliffs is now in session.

58:25.686 --> 58:27.188
You can be seated.

58:32.943 --> 58:36.489
For those of you I haven't met,
my name is Weaver.

58:37.031 --> 58:39.658
I'm from downstate
and I'm sitting temporarily...

58:39.742 --> 58:43.913
...while your good Judge Maitland
is recovering from a severe illness.

58:44.246 --> 58:47.458
There's no need, I think,
to dwell at length upon my methods.

58:47.541 --> 58:50.169
One judge is quite like another.

58:50.252 --> 58:54.048
The only differences may be
in the state of their digestions...

58:54.131 --> 58:57.468
...or their proclivities
for sleeping on the bench.

58:57.635 --> 59:00.387
For myself, I can digest pig iron...

59:00.930 --> 59:04.099
...and while I might appear
to doze occasionally, you'll find...

59:04.183 --> 59:06.060
...that I'm easily awakened...

59:06.143 --> 59:09.688
...particularly if shaken gently
by a good lawyer...

59:09.813 --> 59:11.899
...with a nice point of law.

59:12.983 --> 59:15.736
We will now take up the criminal docket.

59:15.819 --> 59:19.490
Case Number 1:
The People versus Clarence Madigan.

59:20.032 --> 59:22.534
Breaking and entering in the nighttime.

59:23.035 --> 59:25.913
Will the defendant rise and come forward?

59:26.038 --> 59:27.998
That's me, Your Honour.

59:36.382 --> 59:40.552
"State of Michigan, Court of Iron Cliffs.
I, Mitch Lodwick, prosecuting attorney...

59:40.677 --> 59:43.764
"... come into said county
and give the court to understand...

59:43.931 --> 59:49.144
"... that Clarence Madigan, alias 'One-Shot
Madigan,' alias 'Smoky Madigan'...

59:49.228 --> 59:51.438
"... did enter the dwelling of Casper Katz...

59:51.563 --> 59:55.317
"... and did there commit the felony
of larceny on said premises."

59:56.026 --> 59:58.445
Does Mr. Madigan have an attorney?

59:58.529 --> 01:00:02.324
No. A man's got to have money
to ask them fellows the time of day.

01:00:02.574 --> 01:00:06.370
Mr. Madigan, if you're impoverished,
it's my duty to appoint an attorney...

01:00:06.453 --> 01:00:07.788
...on your behalf.

01:00:07.871 --> 01:00:12.960
I wouldn't bother, Your Honour.
I stole the whiskey. I'm guilty as hell.

01:00:13.335 --> 01:00:15.796
It was a full case of expensive bourbon.

01:00:15.921 --> 01:00:17.339
Did you sell this whiskey?

01:00:17.548 --> 01:00:19.049
No. I drank it.

01:00:19.132 --> 01:00:20.926
- All of it?
- You bet, Judge.

01:00:21.009 --> 01:00:24.721
Are you aware that it will be necessary
to punish you for this crime?

01:00:24.846 --> 01:00:26.265
It was worth it.

01:00:26.431 --> 01:00:30.519
I'll accept your plea of guilty.
You'll be sentenced later.

01:00:30.727 --> 01:00:33.897
- You may now return to your place.
- Thanks, Your Honour.

01:00:35.983 --> 01:00:37.651
Case Number 2:

01:00:38.485 --> 01:00:42.656
The People versus Frederick Manion.
The charge: Murder.

01:00:43.156 --> 01:00:47.744
Paul Biegler for the defendant.
My formal appearance is already on file.

01:00:47.911 --> 01:00:50.622
Which of these men is your client,
Mr. Biegler?

01:00:50.706 --> 01:00:52.082
None of them.

01:00:52.165 --> 01:00:55.168
Mr. Sheriff, will you produce the prisoner?

01:00:55.669 --> 01:00:58.380
I'm afraid I can't do that, Your Honour.

01:00:59.589 --> 01:01:02.509
Perhaps someone should explain.
I'm not clairvoyant.

01:01:02.843 --> 01:01:06.847
The defendant is in Detroit
being examined by a psychiatrist.

01:01:06.972 --> 01:01:09.015
Shouldn't the court have been consulted...

01:01:09.099 --> 01:01:12.185
...before the defendant
was allowed to leave its jurisdiction?

01:01:12.269 --> 01:01:14.980
We're dealing with the Army in this matter.

01:01:15.105 --> 01:01:18.316
They only gave us one crack
at one of their psychiatrists.

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:20.569
The court was not present
and it was urgent...

01:01:20.694 --> 01:01:23.155
...to get the defendant to the psychiatrist.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.657
What does the attorney for the People say?

01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:27.868
It was done with my knowledge,
Your Honour.

01:01:27.951 --> 01:01:30.829
I've always heard this Upper Peninsula
of our fair state...

01:01:30.912 --> 01:01:32.581
...was a queer place.

01:01:32.664 --> 01:01:36.376
If it's customary here to allow a man
charged with first-degree murder...

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:40.422
...to wander about at will,
I don't suppose it behoves an outsider...

01:01:40.505 --> 01:01:45.260
...to point out that the law makes
no provision for such quaint liberalism.

01:01:45.594 --> 01:01:50.223
The defendant is in the care of a deputy
and will be returned this afternoon.

01:01:50.307 --> 01:01:53.643
We'll formally arraign the defendant
on his return.

01:01:54.269 --> 01:01:57.522
For the sake of the docket,
can you give me a clue as to his plea?

01:01:57.772 --> 01:02:01.067
The defendant will waive reading
of the information and stand mute.

01:02:01.151 --> 01:02:03.361
A plea of not guilty will be entered.

01:02:03.528 --> 01:02:07.490
The case of Frederick Manion
will be placed first on the trial docket.

01:02:18.918 --> 01:02:20.086
Can you hurry it up?

01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:23.757
If the judge hears the prisoner
was lounging at the railroad station...

01:02:23.882 --> 01:02:25.341
...he'll really give it to me.

01:02:25.425 --> 01:02:28.136
It'll just take a minute. Come over here.

01:02:32.015 --> 01:02:34.142
Lieutenant, how did things turn out?

01:02:34.851 --> 01:02:36.352
I was temporarily insane.

01:02:36.436 --> 01:02:38.104
- Did he tell you that?
- Yeah.

01:02:38.688 --> 01:02:43.443
He said he'd write you a letter,
but I took notes on my own.

01:02:43.568 --> 01:02:45.778
- The doctor's name was Smith.
- Smith?

01:02:45.862 --> 01:02:50.116
Anatole Ludwig Smith
or Ludwig von Smith, I hope.

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:53.494
- Name like that would impress the jury.
- Just plain Matthew Smith.

01:02:53.578 --> 01:02:55.580
He said when I shot Quill...

01:02:55.663 --> 01:02:58.374
...I was suffering from
"dissociative reaction."

01:02:58.625 --> 01:03:02.170
Dissociative reaction.
Sounds pretty good, doesn't it, Parn?

01:03:02.462 --> 01:03:04.005
What does it mean in English?

01:03:04.088 --> 01:03:08.468
It means I had an "irresistible impulse"
to shoot Quill.

01:03:11.429 --> 01:03:12.889
That's okay, isn't it?

01:03:13.097 --> 01:03:15.058
Did he say you knew the difference...

01:03:15.141 --> 01:03:17.602
...between right and wrong
when you shot Quill?

01:03:17.727 --> 01:03:21.064
I don't think he said anything about that.
Is that important?

01:03:21.773 --> 01:03:24.901
We'd better not keep the sheriff waiting.
You'd better go.

01:03:43.544 --> 01:03:47.882
You ever heard of a Michigan court
accepting irresistible impulse as insanity?

01:03:47.965 --> 01:03:50.968
No. Maybe we'd better switch
to self-defence.

01:03:51.427 --> 01:03:54.764
Even Mitch Lodwick
would make a monkey out of us on that.

01:03:54.847 --> 01:03:56.307
Damn strawberry soda.

01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:58.893
- Here, do you want a peanut?
- No, thanks.

01:03:59.602 --> 01:04:01.479
Tomorrow is Saturday.

01:04:01.896 --> 01:04:04.357
We just have the weekend before the trial.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:06.108
When do we start working?

01:04:06.192 --> 01:04:08.569
Tomorrow morning. Early.

01:05:04.125 --> 01:05:06.418
- Pauly!
- Hey, listen to this, Parn.

01:05:06.627 --> 01:05:08.712
Never mind that. Just find:

01:05:09.922 --> 01:05:15.177
"People versus Durfee,
62, Michigan, 486, year 1886."

01:05:15.302 --> 01:05:18.430
<i>That's it. I have it right here in the A.L.R.
Listen.</i>

01:05:18.722 --> 01:05:21.600
"The right and wrong test,
though deemed unscientific...

01:05:21.684 --> 01:05:25.104
"... is adhered to by most of the states,
but..." Listen to this.

01:05:25.187 --> 01:05:28.148
"But, the fact that one accused
of committing a crime...

01:05:28.232 --> 01:05:30.860
"... may have been able
to comprehend the nature...

01:05:30.943 --> 01:05:33.028
"... and the consequences of this act...

01:05:33.112 --> 01:05:36.490
"... and to know that it was wrong,
nevertheless..."

01:05:36.615 --> 01:05:39.326
Dear, sweet, endearing word,
"nevertheless."

01:05:39.577 --> 01:05:44.373
"Nevertheless, if he was forced
to its execution by an impulse...

01:05:44.999 --> 01:05:48.002
"... by an impulse,
which he was powerless to control...

01:05:48.127 --> 01:05:50.462
"... he will be excused from punishment."

01:05:50.754 --> 01:05:54.383
Why, the Michigan Supreme Court
did accept irresistible impulse, Parn.

01:05:54.466 --> 01:05:56.176
This is precedent.

01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:58.429
I think we got a hold of something here.

01:05:58.512 --> 01:06:02.891
Good old Durfee, 1886. How about that?
Give me a pad.

01:06:04.268 --> 01:06:08.063
By the saints, this strawberry soda pop
is beginning to taste like whiskey.

01:06:08.147 --> 01:06:11.567
Don't get drunk yet.
We've got to convince a jury...

01:06:11.734 --> 01:06:14.778
...that our client was irresistibly impulsed.

01:06:14.862 --> 01:06:16.155
Remember that.

01:06:17.406 --> 01:06:19.700
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

01:06:20.075 --> 01:06:23.787
Before we proceed, it will be necessary
for me to examine you...

01:06:23.871 --> 01:06:27.166
...on your qualifications to sit as jurors.

01:06:27.916 --> 01:06:30.377
Please remember that you are under oath.

01:06:30.461 --> 01:06:32.337
Are all of you citizens?

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:35.716
Will you please raise your hand
if you are not?

01:06:48.395 --> 01:06:53.275
Are there any justices of the peace
or law enforcement officers among you?

01:06:53.650 --> 01:06:54.735
No.

01:06:55.861 --> 01:07:00.616
Are any of you related by blood
or marriage to a law enforcement officer?

01:07:01.074 --> 01:07:02.367
No.

01:07:02.576 --> 01:07:06.330
So much for qualifications.
I will now examine for cause.

01:07:06.705 --> 01:07:11.418
Does anyone have business pending with
the prosecuting attorney, Mitch Lodwick?

01:07:11.501 --> 01:07:12.753
No.

01:07:13.086 --> 01:07:18.133
Does anyone have business pending
with Paul Biegler, attorney for the defence?

01:07:18.425 --> 01:07:19.634
No.

01:07:20.052 --> 01:07:22.095
Is anyone acquainted with the defendant...

01:07:22.179 --> 01:07:24.556
...seated there on Mr. Biegler's left?

01:07:29.102 --> 01:07:31.188
Will the defendant's wife please stand?

01:07:31.271 --> 01:07:34.399
- Do any of you know Mrs. Manion?
- No.

01:07:34.483 --> 01:07:37.277
Thank you, Mrs. Manion.
You may be seated.

01:07:38.403 --> 01:07:40.655
Counsel may challenge the jury for cause.

01:07:40.864 --> 01:07:45.827
Before counsel's challenge, may I introduce
Mr. Claude Dancer to the court?

01:07:46.369 --> 01:07:49.414
Mr. Dancer is an assistant attorney general
from Lansing.

01:07:49.539 --> 01:07:52.209
Because of the peculiar nature
of this case...

01:07:52.292 --> 01:07:56.213
...I asked the attorney general
for Mr. Dancer to sit with the prosecution.

01:07:56.546 --> 01:07:58.798
Your reputation precedes you, Mr. Dancer.

01:07:58.965 --> 01:08:03.136
- It's a privilege to have you in my court.
- I'm sure it'll be instructive.

01:08:04.429 --> 01:08:09.309
Do any of you have any business pending
before the attorney general's office?

01:08:09.517 --> 01:08:11.102
No.

01:08:11.978 --> 01:08:14.898
I must apologise
for my disparaging remarks...

01:08:14.981 --> 01:08:17.567
...about the Upper Peninsula
and its customs.

01:08:17.692 --> 01:08:22.738
I've seldom seen a murder jury selected
and sworn in less than half a day.

01:08:23.198 --> 01:08:26.201
You've won my heart completely.

01:08:26.283 --> 01:08:29.662
Mr. Dancer, you asked for the recess.
What's your problem?

01:08:29.828 --> 01:08:32.499
There was a little suggestion
I wanted to make.

01:08:32.624 --> 01:08:33.957
By all means.

01:08:34.042 --> 01:08:38.755
Since the defence plea is insanity,
the prosecution has retained a psychiatrist.

01:08:38.962 --> 01:08:43.551
By statute, we have the right to request
a mental examination by our own doctor.

01:08:43.635 --> 01:08:46.054
Are you familiar with that statute,
Mr. Biegler?

01:08:47.055 --> 01:08:48.180
Moderately.

01:08:48.264 --> 01:08:51.059
It would only delay things
to file a formal petition...

01:08:51.184 --> 01:08:54.395
...so why don't we informally agree...

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:57.273
...to ask for an adjournment?
Only a day or so...

01:08:57.399 --> 01:09:01.277
...and our doctor can see the defendant.
It would save a great deal of time.

01:09:01.402 --> 01:09:03.279
- Yes, I'm sure it will.
- Good.

01:09:03.404 --> 01:09:07.742
But, suppose you just go ahead
and file that formal petition anyway?

01:09:08.368 --> 01:09:12.122
You're a little late,
but maybe His Honour will overlook that.

01:09:12.330 --> 01:09:17.335
I'd sort of like the jury to see that
you think our insanity plea has some merit.

01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:20.046
There's no need for our doctor
to examine your client.

01:09:20.171 --> 01:09:23.550
- I was only following the usual procedure.
- I'm all for it.

01:09:24.133 --> 01:09:25.801
Do you wish to file the petition?

01:09:26.553 --> 01:09:28.263
- Yes...
- It won't be necessary.

01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:30.014
It won't be necessary.

01:09:30.265 --> 01:09:33.935
Skirmish over.
Shall we join now on the field of battle?

01:09:37.729 --> 01:09:41.526
The body of Quill had sustained
five gunshot wounds.

01:09:42.109 --> 01:09:45.029
One of the bullets
had passed through the heart.

01:09:45.113 --> 01:09:48.448
Death, in my opinion,
was almost instantaneous...

01:09:48.533 --> 01:09:50.785
...and was directly caused by this wound.

01:09:50.868 --> 01:09:53.830
Dr. Raschid,
may I have your detailed report?

01:09:53.912 --> 01:09:55.164
Certainly.

01:09:55.248 --> 01:09:59.002
I ask that this report be marked
"People's Exhibit 1" for identification.

01:09:59.085 --> 01:10:00.920
So received and marked.

01:10:01.337 --> 01:10:04.507
The People hand the defence
a copy of the report.

01:10:04.674 --> 01:10:06.718
Counsel may cross-examine.

01:10:06.801 --> 01:10:11.639
Dr. Raschid, your primary purpose was
to ascertain the cause of death, was it not?

01:10:11.723 --> 01:10:12.890
Yes.

01:10:12.974 --> 01:10:14.851
Yet I read in your report...

01:10:14.976 --> 01:10:18.771
...you checked to determine
if spermatogenesis was occurring...

01:10:18.896 --> 01:10:21.107
...in the body at the time of death.

01:10:21.190 --> 01:10:22.567
Objection, Your Honour!

01:10:22.650 --> 01:10:25.736
The People call this witness
only to show the cause of death.

01:10:25.862 --> 01:10:28.739
Your Honour,
the entire report was offered as evidence...

01:10:28.823 --> 01:10:31.701
...and it contains this information
about spermatogenesis.

01:10:31.826 --> 01:10:34.745
Overruled, Mr. Lodwick.
The witness may answer.

01:10:35.663 --> 01:10:38.457
Yes, I made that examination
on the deceased.

01:10:38.708 --> 01:10:41.127
Would you tell the court your findings?

01:10:41.878 --> 01:10:44.589
Spermatogenesis was occurring
at the time of death.

01:10:45.089 --> 01:10:48.259
In other words, the deceased,
in life, was not sterile.

01:10:48.676 --> 01:10:50.678
- He could produce children.
- Correct.

01:10:50.761 --> 01:10:55.099
If a woman says she has had intercourse
with a certain man...

01:10:56.017 --> 01:11:00.021
...who is proven fertile, though no evidence
is found in the woman's body...

01:11:00.104 --> 01:11:02.481
...could a lawyer, a prosecuting attorney...

01:11:02.565 --> 01:11:05.943
...could he use this as evidence
that the woman is lying?

01:11:06.027 --> 01:11:07.236
Your Honour...

01:11:07.361 --> 01:11:10.531
...I object to this line of questioning.

01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:15.369
We are not concerned here with relations
between a man and a woman.

01:11:15.453 --> 01:11:18.706
As long as an examination
for spermatogenesis had been made...

01:11:18.831 --> 01:11:20.833
...at least we're entitled to know why.

01:11:20.916 --> 01:11:22.501
Overruled. You may answer.

01:11:22.877 --> 01:11:25.588
Yes, prosecution could use that...

01:11:25.713 --> 01:11:29.091
...though it certainly would not be
conclusive that she was lying.

01:11:29.383 --> 01:11:30.468
Why not?

01:11:30.551 --> 01:11:33.929
There could be several reasons
why the test on her was negative.

01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:36.891
The use of a contraceptive...

01:11:37.183 --> 01:11:40.895
...or possibly, there was no completion
on the part of the man.

01:11:41.228 --> 01:11:43.814
In this post-mortem,
were you asked to determine...

01:11:43.898 --> 01:11:46.525
...if the deceased
had reached sexual climax...

01:11:46.609 --> 01:11:48.819
...shortly before death?
- No, sir.

01:11:48.944 --> 01:11:51.655
- Could you have determined it?
- Yes.

01:11:52.448 --> 01:11:55.326
So, you were only asked
to make such examinations...

01:11:55.451 --> 01:11:58.579
...that might be useful to the prosecution,
but not the defence?

01:11:58.662 --> 01:12:00.122
I object, Your Honour.

01:12:00.664 --> 01:12:02.333
The question is argumentative.

01:12:02.416 --> 01:12:06.879
The defence is trying to impugn the intent
of the representatives of the People.

01:12:06.962 --> 01:12:10.174
Mr. Biegler, you must be aware
that the question is improper.

01:12:10.257 --> 01:12:12.843
I withdraw the question and apologise.

01:12:13.052 --> 01:12:15.304
The question and answer will be stricken...

01:12:15.471 --> 01:12:19.058
...and the jury will disregard
both the question and the answer.

01:12:20.017 --> 01:12:21.185
That's all.

01:12:21.477 --> 01:12:25.522
No redirect.
The People now call Lloyd Burke.

01:12:26.315 --> 01:12:28.734
Will the witness step forward, please?

01:12:32.363 --> 01:12:35.783
How can a jury disregard
what it has already heard?

01:12:36.533 --> 01:12:38.661
They can't, Lieutenant.

01:12:39.411 --> 01:12:40.662
They can't.

01:12:41.747 --> 01:12:44.249
...the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

01:12:44.333 --> 01:12:45.376
I do.

01:12:47.252 --> 01:12:49.505
Will you state your profession, please?

01:12:49.630 --> 01:12:51.298
I'm a commercial photographer.

01:12:51.507 --> 01:12:53.967
Were you called upon by the police...

01:12:54.051 --> 01:12:57.846
...to take photographs of the body
of the deceased, Bernard Quill...

01:12:57.930 --> 01:13:00.974
...before and after he was removed
from the scene of death?

01:13:01.058 --> 01:13:02.142
Yes, sir.

01:13:02.226 --> 01:13:05.145
Were these photographs of the deceased
made by you?

01:13:09.817 --> 01:13:11.193
They were.

01:13:11.401 --> 01:13:13.362
The recorder will mark these photographs:

01:13:13.445 --> 01:13:16.406
"People's Exhibit 2A to 2D"
for identification.

01:13:16.657 --> 01:13:19.952
Photographs are tendered to the defence
for examination...

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:22.955
...and we move their admission
as evidence. Your witness.

01:13:23.247 --> 01:13:24.831
No questions, no objections.

01:13:24.915 --> 01:13:28.919
- He took pictures of me that night, too.
- Just a minute, Mr. Burke.

01:13:32.130 --> 01:13:35.092
Mr. Burke, these photographs
offered as evidence:

01:13:35.175 --> 01:13:37.928
Are they the only photographs
you took that night?

01:13:38.887 --> 01:13:40.138
No.

01:13:40.347 --> 01:13:42.266
The others didn't turn out?

01:13:43.141 --> 01:13:45.060
All my pictures turn out.

01:13:45.268 --> 01:13:48.397
Of course. I beg your pardon.

01:13:48.563 --> 01:13:50.899
Did you give the other pictures
to the police?

01:13:51.066 --> 01:13:52.359
Yes, sir, I did.

01:13:52.651 --> 01:13:53.694
What were they?

01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:57.572
Were they side shots
or a shot of the moon, perhaps?

01:13:57.656 --> 01:14:00.367
Or a black bear scavenging
in the Thunder Bay dump?

01:14:00.450 --> 01:14:04.496
I object. I can't see how other photographs
are relevant.

01:14:04.579 --> 01:14:06.790
The photographs
were introduced to show...

01:14:06.873 --> 01:14:09.334
...that the deceased
met with a violent death.

01:14:09.584 --> 01:14:13.004
Your Honour, any photograph
pertaining to the case would be relevant.

01:14:13.296 --> 01:14:15.799
The point is good, Mr. Biegler. Continue.

01:14:16.007 --> 01:14:18.802
What were these other photographs of,
Mr. Burke?

01:14:19.719 --> 01:14:21.346
Lt. Manion's wife.

01:14:21.513 --> 01:14:25.267
These photographs showed how she looked
after Barney Quill was killed?

01:14:25.517 --> 01:14:28.436
- Yes.
- Your Honour, how she looked is irrelevant.

01:14:28.603 --> 01:14:32.149
No evidence has been introduced
to connect her appearance to the murder.

01:14:32.232 --> 01:14:34.776
- Sustained.
- I'm sorry, Your Honour.

01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:38.113
I wanted to be sure the prosecution
wasn't withholding evidence.

01:14:38.196 --> 01:14:39.489
Now, look here!

01:14:39.698 --> 01:14:42.742
I protest to the defence attorney's
persistent attacks...

01:14:42.868 --> 01:14:45.161
...on the motives of the prosecution.

01:14:45.287 --> 01:14:49.874
The jury will disregard the remark made
by the attorney for the defence.

01:14:50.250 --> 01:14:54.504
There is no reason to believe
the prosecution hasn't acted in good faith.

01:14:54.671 --> 01:14:57.674
My apologies to the prosecution
and the court.

01:14:57.757 --> 01:14:59.175
But, Your Honour...

01:14:59.342 --> 01:15:03.763
...as long as protests are being made,
I'd like to make a protest myself.

01:15:03.972 --> 01:15:09.144
I'm perfectly willing to take on
these two legal giants any time, any place.

01:15:09.477 --> 01:15:11.980
But, in all fairness,
it ought to be one at a time.

01:15:12.063 --> 01:15:15.734
I don't want these two pitching
knuckle balls at me at the same time.

01:15:16.192 --> 01:15:19.154
It seems to me
you're batting close to 1000...

01:15:19.279 --> 01:15:21.698
...but your point is well-taken.

01:15:21.948 --> 01:15:24.367
Whichever attorney opens
with the witness...

01:15:24.617 --> 01:15:29.122
...he, alone, shall continue
with that witness until they are excused.

01:15:29.247 --> 01:15:31.499
Thank you, Your Honour.
No more questions.

01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:33.126
No questions.

01:15:44.137 --> 01:15:45.722
We're doing well, aren't we?

01:15:45.805 --> 01:15:49.017
- Where is Parnell?
- Why? Isn't he here?

01:15:49.142 --> 01:15:52.353
No, nor in his rooming house.
He hasn't been there all night.

01:15:52.437 --> 01:15:54.147
You saw him last. Where is he?

01:15:54.230 --> 01:15:56.482
I promised not to tell, so don't ask me.

01:15:56.566 --> 01:15:58.693
He hasn't fallen off the wagon?

01:15:58.818 --> 01:16:00.028
No. He was sober.

01:16:00.111 --> 01:16:01.404
Has he gone somewhere?

01:16:01.487 --> 01:16:03.781
He did borrow my car for something.

01:16:03.865 --> 01:16:05.658
Your car? That was smart.

01:16:05.742 --> 01:16:09.329
He hasn't driven a car in 20 years.
He'll kill himself. Where's he gone?

01:16:09.454 --> 01:16:11.247
My word is my bond.

01:16:37.148 --> 01:16:39.067
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

01:16:39.359 --> 01:16:40.401
You may proceed.

01:16:41.152 --> 01:16:42.737
Your Honour...

01:16:43.237 --> 01:16:46.991
...the defence notices a third person
at the prosecution's table.

01:16:47.075 --> 01:16:50.203
We were wondering if the court
shares our curiosity about him?

01:16:50.286 --> 01:16:51.913
I was about to introduce him.

01:16:52.246 --> 01:16:55.958
Your Honour, this gentleman
is Dr. W. Gregory Harcourt.

01:16:56.751 --> 01:17:00.004
Dr. Harcourt is the People's psychiatrist
in this case.

01:17:00.588 --> 01:17:04.967
We ask that Dr. Harcourt be allowed
to sit at our table as an observer.

01:17:05.134 --> 01:17:10.014
What will he observe? The constellation
of Taurus or the life of a bumblebee?

01:17:10.389 --> 01:17:12.266
He'll observe the defendant.

01:17:13.434 --> 01:17:14.810
That's fine.

01:17:14.894 --> 01:17:16.646
The defence has no objection.

01:17:16.729 --> 01:17:19.398
I just wish to express my relief...

01:17:19.565 --> 01:17:23.611
...that the new recruit is not additional
legal reinforcements from Lansing.

01:17:24.028 --> 01:17:26.280
We call Alphonse Paquette.

01:17:32.662 --> 01:17:34.372
Raise your right hand, please.

01:17:34.455 --> 01:17:37.166
You do solemnly swear
that the testimony you give...

01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:41.045
...shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

01:17:41.170 --> 01:17:42.922
- I do.
- Take the seat, please.

01:17:45.675 --> 01:17:47.510
Will you state your name, please?

01:17:47.593 --> 01:17:49.178
Alphonse Paquette.

01:17:49.261 --> 01:17:53.182
- You work at the Thunder Bay Inn, right?
- I'm bartender there.

01:17:53.432 --> 01:17:56.811
Were you working the night
Mr. Quill was shot by Frederick Manion?

01:17:56.894 --> 01:17:59.146
- I was.
- Were you witness to the shooting?

01:17:59.355 --> 01:18:00.439
I was.

01:18:00.523 --> 01:18:03.526
Will you tell us in your own words, please,
what happened?

01:18:04.610 --> 01:18:07.988
I was at a table by the door
when Lt. Manion came in.

01:18:08.072 --> 01:18:10.199
Did you know Lt. Manion
by sight and name?

01:18:10.408 --> 01:18:11.826
- Yes, sir.
- Go ahead.

01:18:13.035 --> 01:18:16.789
He came in and walked over to the bar
and began to shoot.

01:18:17.790 --> 01:18:20.251
He shot Barney
when he came up to the bar.

01:18:20.417 --> 01:18:24.130
When Barney fell, he kept on shooting
down at Barney behind the bar.

01:18:24.338 --> 01:18:25.965
Then he turned and walked out.

01:18:26.048 --> 01:18:30.427
When Lt. Manion entered the bar,
how did he appear to you?

01:18:30.678 --> 01:18:32.555
Well, he walked slow.

01:18:33.097 --> 01:18:35.307
Kind of deliberate.

01:18:35.391 --> 01:18:37.351
Did he speak to Barney Quill?

01:18:37.434 --> 01:18:38.602
Not a word.

01:18:39.061 --> 01:18:42.064
He just walked over
and pulled out his gun and "bang."

01:18:42.648 --> 01:18:44.900
- And then he walked out?
- Yes.

01:18:45.734 --> 01:18:48.571
When he walked out,
how did he appear to you?

01:18:49.071 --> 01:18:51.448
He seemed just like he did
when he walked in.

01:18:51.574 --> 01:18:53.784
Like he was the mailman delivering mail.

01:18:54.201 --> 01:18:57.204
When Lt. Manion walked out of the bar,
what did you do?

01:18:57.329 --> 01:19:00.582
It happened so fast,
I guess I was stunned...

01:19:00.916 --> 01:19:03.585
...but then I ran after him.
- Did you find him outside?

01:19:03.752 --> 01:19:06.463
- Yes, sir. He was walking away.
- Did you speak to him?

01:19:06.588 --> 01:19:10.759
I said, "Lieutenant,
you'd better not run away from this."

01:19:10.884 --> 01:19:12.720
Did he reply to you?

01:19:13.345 --> 01:19:16.265
He said, "Do you want some, too, buster?"

01:19:16.974 --> 01:19:18.892
Was he pointing the gun at you?

01:19:18.976 --> 01:19:22.855
He was holding the gun in my direction,
but the muzzle was low.

01:19:23.147 --> 01:19:27.109
When he said,
"Do you want some, too, buster?"...

01:19:27.234 --> 01:19:28.736
...how was that expressed?

01:19:28.819 --> 01:19:33.991
Did he shout it? Was it hysterical?
Was he hoarse? Did his voice tremble?

01:19:34.825 --> 01:19:38.912
No, sir. He just said it cool and hard,
and looked right at me.

01:19:39.288 --> 01:19:42.291
Did he appear to you,
as far as you could tell...

01:19:42.416 --> 01:19:45.294
...to be in complete possession
of his faculties?

01:19:45.711 --> 01:19:48.046
Yes, sir, as far as I could tell.

01:19:48.630 --> 01:19:51.550
- Your witness.
- Did you see Laura Manion...

01:19:51.675 --> 01:19:53.927
...Lt. Manion's wife, in the bar that night?

01:19:54.011 --> 01:19:57.139
There he goes again.
This is immaterial and irrelevant.

01:19:57.222 --> 01:20:01.185
I don't see what the prosecution's
jumpy about. I haven't gone any place yet.

01:20:01.476 --> 01:20:04.897
Let's see where he's going
before we start objecting, Mr. Lodwick.

01:20:05.063 --> 01:20:07.065
You may proceed, Mr. Biegler.

01:20:07.316 --> 01:20:10.027
Did you see Mrs. Manion
in the bar that night?

01:20:10.193 --> 01:20:13.780
- She was there.
- Did Barney Quill leave the bar that night?

01:20:14.448 --> 01:20:16.533
- Yes.
- Do you remember when he returned?

01:20:16.783 --> 01:20:18.452
Around midnight.

01:20:18.910 --> 01:20:20.662
From which entrance did he come?

01:20:20.746 --> 01:20:24.916
Did he come from the lobby entrance
or from that outside entrance?

01:20:25.042 --> 01:20:26.710
It was from the lobby.

01:20:27.252 --> 01:20:30.213
- How did he appear to you at that time?
- How do you mean?

01:20:30.756 --> 01:20:32.674
You understood the prosecution...

01:20:32.758 --> 01:20:35.469
...when he asked
about Lt. Manion's appearance.

01:20:35.969 --> 01:20:38.764
He was just old Barney, like usual.

01:20:39.139 --> 01:20:43.310
You mean,
he was just good old, sober, reliable...

01:20:43.435 --> 01:20:47.439
...gentle, salt-of-the-earth,
friend-to-man Barney?

01:20:47.522 --> 01:20:51.193
- What kind of a question is that?
- I withdraw the question.

01:20:53.070 --> 01:20:54.821
Mr. Paquette...

01:20:55.113 --> 01:20:58.909
...had Barney changed his clothes
since he left the bar?

01:20:59.117 --> 01:21:00.160
I don't remember.

01:21:00.285 --> 01:21:03.038
Might his clothing have been different
when he returned?

01:21:03.121 --> 01:21:05.832
That is,
might he have changed his clothes?

01:21:06.291 --> 01:21:07.876
I couldn't say. I didn't notice.

01:21:08.168 --> 01:21:09.961
Was Barney drinking that night?

01:21:11.838 --> 01:21:14.674
He always had a few shots
while talking to the customers.

01:21:14.758 --> 01:21:18.053
- He was friendly.
- Sure he was, good old Barney.

01:21:18.178 --> 01:21:21.890
How many shots would you say
good old Barney usually had?

01:21:22.140 --> 01:21:23.225
I don't know exactly.

01:21:23.308 --> 01:21:26.353
Wasn't he, in fact,
pretty loaded that night?

01:21:26.436 --> 01:21:27.771
Objection.

01:21:27.854 --> 01:21:31.441
Even if the deceased was dead drunk,
it's no defence to this charge.

01:21:31.733 --> 01:21:34.861
Sustained. I suggest you get off this.

01:21:35.362 --> 01:21:36.696
Mr. Paquette.

01:21:36.863 --> 01:21:40.533
What would you call a man
with an insatiable penchant for women?

01:21:41.368 --> 01:21:42.494
A what?

01:21:42.953 --> 01:21:46.289
A penchant: A desire, a taste, passion.

01:21:47.624 --> 01:21:49.292
A ladies' man, I guess.

01:21:49.376 --> 01:21:51.628
Or maybe just a damned fool.

01:21:53.129 --> 01:21:56.007
Just answer the questions, Mr. Paquette.

01:21:56.341 --> 01:21:58.885
The attorneys will provide the wisecracks.

01:22:00.553 --> 01:22:02.931
What else would you call a man like that?

01:22:03.014 --> 01:22:05.183
We can't see the drift of this.

01:22:05.266 --> 01:22:07.310
You mean you do see, Mr. Lodwick.

01:22:07.519 --> 01:22:08.561
You may answer.

01:22:09.020 --> 01:22:11.022
Can you think of another name?

01:22:11.856 --> 01:22:13.858
- Woman chaser.
- Try again.

01:22:14.776 --> 01:22:17.529
- Masher?
- Come now, Mr. Paquette.

01:22:17.612 --> 01:22:21.116
Mashers went out
with whalebone corsets and hairnets.

01:22:21.658 --> 01:22:24.828
- Did you ever hear the expression "wolf"?
- Sure, I've heard that.

01:22:24.994 --> 01:22:28.414
- It just slipped my mind.
- Slipped your mind. Naturally, it would.

01:22:28.498 --> 01:22:31.125
Clanking around in there
with those rusty old mashers.

01:22:31.209 --> 01:22:34.671
Have you ever known a man
who you could call a wolf?

01:22:34.963 --> 01:22:37.715
- I'm not sure.
- Was Barney Quill a wolf?

01:22:37.882 --> 01:22:39.175
- I couldn't say.
- Or wouldn't.

01:22:39.259 --> 01:22:41.219
- Objection.
- Sustained.

01:22:41.302 --> 01:22:44.138
The question was answered.
He said he couldn't say.

01:22:45.014 --> 01:22:47.850
Mr. Paquette, when Barney returned...

01:22:47.976 --> 01:22:50.186
...from wherever he had gone...

01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:52.230
...did he relieve you at the bar?
- Yes.

01:22:52.647 --> 01:22:55.650
- What did he say?
- He said, "I'll take over."

01:22:55.858 --> 01:22:58.152
Coming out from behind the bar,
where did you go?

01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:02.073
I went over to the Pedersons' table.

01:23:02.573 --> 01:23:06.077
You testified that you were by the door
when Lt. Manion came in.

01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:09.247
You were by the door
because the Pedersons' table was there?

01:23:09.372 --> 01:23:10.665
Yes.

01:23:10.748 --> 01:23:13.501
How long was it
before Lt. Manion came in?

01:23:14.711 --> 01:23:17.880
I don't know exactly. Maybe 30 minutes.

01:23:17.964 --> 01:23:20.466
And you remained with the Pedersons
all that time?

01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:21.968
Yes. They're my friends.

01:23:22.135 --> 01:23:24.762
Is there also a window beside that table?

01:23:25.096 --> 01:23:26.931
- I think so.
- You think so.

01:23:27.014 --> 01:23:30.268
How long have you worked
at the Thunder Bay Inn?

01:23:30.476 --> 01:23:31.769
Six or seven years.

01:23:31.853 --> 01:23:36.190
Does this window beside the table
suddenly vanish...

01:23:36.315 --> 01:23:40.236
...and then reappear,
and come and go in a ghostly fashion?

01:23:40.319 --> 01:23:41.612
It's there all the time.

01:23:41.696 --> 01:23:45.533
While you were talking to your friends,
did you look out the window?

01:23:46.242 --> 01:23:48.202
- I might have.
- When you looked out...

01:23:48.286 --> 01:23:51.956
...were you looking for something?
- No, I wasn't looking for anything.

01:23:52.081 --> 01:23:56.544
Didn't Barney Quill tell you to go
to the window and watch out for Manion?

01:23:59.964 --> 01:24:02.633
Did he tell you to look out for Lt. Manion?

01:24:03.175 --> 01:24:04.594
He did not.

01:24:06.596 --> 01:24:10.391
Barney was quite a marksman, wasn't he?
With guns.

01:24:10.558 --> 01:24:12.560
He'd won prizes for shooting, hadn't he?

01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:16.397
- Yes.
- Did he keep any guns behind the bar?

01:24:22.570 --> 01:24:24.030
He might have.

01:24:24.113 --> 01:24:28.117
Isn't it a fact that there are three
concealed pistol racks behind the bar?

01:24:28.492 --> 01:24:31.996
The defendant's plea is one of insanity,
not self-defence.

01:24:32.163 --> 01:24:35.833
I'm sure Mr. Biegler hasn't forgotten that,
Mr. Lodwick.

01:24:36.083 --> 01:24:37.376
You may answer.

01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:40.254
Are there concealed gun racks
behind the bar?

01:24:40.671 --> 01:24:43.883
- Yes.
- How many people know of the gun racks?

01:24:44.467 --> 01:24:45.509
I couldn't say.

01:24:45.593 --> 01:24:49.305
Isn't it a fact that Barney
would sometimes take the guns out...

01:24:49.388 --> 01:24:54.226
...twirling them on his fingers,
to demonstrate his skill to the patrons?

01:24:55.144 --> 01:24:57.646
- I don't remember.
- Try and remember.

01:24:57.730 --> 01:24:59.940
Did you ever see him do that yourself?

01:25:00.733 --> 01:25:01.817
Once or twice.

01:25:01.984 --> 01:25:03.819
That's all, Mr. Paquette.

01:25:03.903 --> 01:25:05.404
No further questions.

01:25:05.488 --> 01:25:06.947
The witness may step down.

01:25:07.031 --> 01:25:09.283
Call George Lemon.

01:25:14.914 --> 01:25:17.249
Biegler's going off in all directions.

01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:19.293
What's he getting at?

01:25:22.546 --> 01:25:25.716
I have a feeling he's afraid
of what we'll get at.

01:25:26.592 --> 01:25:29.136
Mr. Biegler's putting up a smoke screen
for some reason.

01:25:30.220 --> 01:25:31.347
- I do.
- Take the seat, please.

01:25:33.974 --> 01:25:36.769
- Will you state your name, please?
- George Lemon.

01:25:37.394 --> 01:25:39.313
What kind of work do you do?

01:25:39.605 --> 01:25:42.441
I'm caretaker of the tourist park
in Thunder Bay.

01:25:42.524 --> 01:25:44.443
I see the place is clean and orderly.

01:25:44.568 --> 01:25:47.112
I check people in and out,
lock the gate at night.

01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:50.407
What is your authority for these duties?

01:25:50.658 --> 01:25:54.328
I'm paid by Mastodon township
and I'm also a deputy sheriff...

01:25:54.453 --> 01:25:55.871
...just courtesy, sort of.

01:25:56.538 --> 01:25:59.333
Did you see Lt. Manion
on the night of the 15th...

01:25:59.666 --> 01:26:02.378
...the night Barney Quill was killed?
- Yes, sir.

01:26:03.337 --> 01:26:05.339
Will you tell the court...

01:26:05.422 --> 01:26:10.260
...about how and when
you saw Lt. Manion?

01:26:10.719 --> 01:26:13.514
About 1:00 a.m.,
a knock on my door waked me up.

01:26:13.597 --> 01:26:16.183
I went to the door
and Lt. Manion was standing there.

01:26:16.266 --> 01:26:20.521
He said, "You better take me, Mr. Lemon,
because I just shot Barney Quill."

01:26:21.230 --> 01:26:24.441
I told him to go to his trailer
and that I would call the police.

01:26:24.775 --> 01:26:28.445
How did Lt. Manion appear to you
when he asked you to take him?

01:26:28.737 --> 01:26:32.157
He said what he had to and did what I said.
There wasn't any fuss.

01:26:32.282 --> 01:26:35.452
Did he appear to be,
as far as you could tell...

01:26:35.786 --> 01:26:37.996
...in complete possession of his faculties?

01:26:38.413 --> 01:26:40.249
As far as I could tell, yes, sir.

01:26:41.959 --> 01:26:43.460
Take the witness.

01:26:43.961 --> 01:26:47.464
Mr. Lemon,
did you go to the Manions' trailer?

01:26:47.631 --> 01:26:48.674
Yes, sir.

01:26:48.757 --> 01:26:51.426
- Did you see Mrs. Manion at the trailer?
- Yes, sir.

01:26:51.593 --> 01:26:53.220
What was her appearance?

01:26:54.221 --> 01:26:55.639
She was a mess.

01:26:57.015 --> 01:26:59.518
Objection.
No evidence has been introduced...

01:26:59.643 --> 01:27:02.104
...to make Mrs. Manion's
appearance relevant.

01:27:02.270 --> 01:27:05.941
No evidence was introduced to make
Barney Quill's appearance relevant...

01:27:06.024 --> 01:27:07.776
...but you didn't object to that.

01:27:07.901 --> 01:27:11.697
Is that because you know
that Barney Quill bathed and changed...

01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:14.324
...after he raped and beat
this poor woman?

01:27:14.408 --> 01:27:18.578
Everybody in this court is being tried
except Frederick Manion. I protest...

01:27:18.704 --> 01:27:22.791
This is a cross-examination
in a murder case, not a high-school debate!

01:27:22.874 --> 01:27:26.503
What are you trying to do,
railroad this soldier into the clink?

01:27:26.586 --> 01:27:29.339
Mr. Biegler,
you are an experienced attorney...

01:27:29.464 --> 01:27:32.175
...and you know better
than to make such an outburst.

01:27:32.259 --> 01:27:35.387
I will not tolerate
intemperance of this sort.

01:27:35.470 --> 01:27:38.515
If you once again try the patience
of this court...

01:27:38.598 --> 01:27:40.642
...I shall hold you in contempt.

01:27:42.352 --> 01:27:43.395
Sorry.

01:27:44.437 --> 01:27:45.647
Your Honour...

01:27:46.523 --> 01:27:48.108
...I apologise.

01:27:48.817 --> 01:27:49.985
It won't happen again.

01:27:50.277 --> 01:27:54.698
The witness' answer will be stricken
and the jury will disregard the answer.

01:27:55.448 --> 01:27:57.742
Now you may proceed, Mr. Biegler.

01:27:57.868 --> 01:27:59.119
Yes, sir.

01:28:00.036 --> 01:28:01.496
Mr. Lemon.

01:28:02.038 --> 01:28:05.667
On the night when Lt. Manion
awakened you and turned himself in...

01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:07.252
...had you been awakened before?

01:28:07.335 --> 01:28:10.130
- Had anything else disturbed your slumber?
- No, sir.

01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:12.173
There were no soldiers singing?

01:28:12.257 --> 01:28:14.718
No, sir. Not in my park after 10:00.

01:28:15.010 --> 01:28:16.970
There were no women screaming?

01:28:17.262 --> 01:28:19.139
Those screams were down by the gate.

01:28:19.264 --> 01:28:20.598
Objection!

01:28:20.765 --> 01:28:23.435
I see no reason for objecting yet.

01:28:24.060 --> 01:28:26.563
Tell us about those screams, Mr. Lemon.

01:28:27.272 --> 01:28:28.940
I didn't hear them myself.

01:28:29.024 --> 01:28:33.028
Some tourists from Ohio in the park
heard them and told me the next day.

01:28:33.153 --> 01:28:34.195
Mr. Lodwick?

01:28:34.279 --> 01:28:37.240
This testimony is incompetent, hearsay...

01:28:37.323 --> 01:28:40.285
...irrelevant, immaterial, inconclusive...

01:28:40.368 --> 01:28:42.287
That's too much for me.

01:28:42.829 --> 01:28:44.539
The witness is yours.

01:28:46.916 --> 01:28:48.418
No questions.

01:28:48.877 --> 01:28:50.628
The witness may step down.

01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:52.464
Call your next witness.

01:28:54.799 --> 01:28:56.885
Detective Sgt. James Durgo.

01:28:58.887 --> 01:29:00.680
- Hi, Pauly.
- Hi, Jim.

01:29:03.016 --> 01:29:06.144
As soon as we break,
you'd better phone that Army psychiatrist.

01:29:06.227 --> 01:29:08.605
- Tell him to be here day after tomorrow.
- Will do.

01:29:09.314 --> 01:29:12.483
Will you please tell me
where Parnell has gone?

01:29:12.567 --> 01:29:13.902
Won't do.

01:29:14.277 --> 01:29:15.778
You're fired!

01:29:16.905 --> 01:29:19.449
You can't fire me till you pay me.

01:29:21.910 --> 01:29:24.829
Were you called to Thunder Bay
by Deputy Sheriff Lemon...

01:29:24.913 --> 01:29:27.916
...on the night Barney Quill was killed?
- Yes, sir, I was.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.002
My companion officer and I
were first on the case.

01:29:31.252 --> 01:29:34.839
Sgt. Durgo, when you arrived
at the Manion trailer, who was there?

01:29:35.048 --> 01:29:36.924
Lt. Manion and his wife.

01:29:37.425 --> 01:29:39.761
What did Lt. Manion say to you?

01:29:40.762 --> 01:29:43.806
He said his wife had had some trouble
with Barney Quill...

01:29:44.140 --> 01:29:46.768
...and that he'd gone to the tavern
and shot Quill.

01:29:46.976 --> 01:29:50.188
He asked whether Quill was dead or not,
we told him he was.

01:29:50.396 --> 01:29:52.857
How did Lt. Manion take this information?

01:29:53.524 --> 01:29:54.984
He didn't seem surprised.

01:29:55.193 --> 01:29:56.861
What did you do then?

01:29:57.236 --> 01:29:58.946
I asked for the gun he'd used.

01:29:59.197 --> 01:30:03.201
Did you take Lt. Manion
to the jail here in Iron City that night?

01:30:03.493 --> 01:30:06.245
Yes, sir. We drove the lieutenant down
with his wife.

01:30:06.329 --> 01:30:10.291
On the drive to Iron City,
did the lieutenant talk about the shooting?

01:30:11.584 --> 01:30:15.171
He said that if he could do
the whole thing again, he'd still do it.

01:30:15.630 --> 01:30:19.050
During all this,
at the trailer, the drive to Iron City...

01:30:19.175 --> 01:30:20.760
...how did Lt. Manion appear?

01:30:22.178 --> 01:30:24.305
He was very quiet most of the time.

01:30:24.514 --> 01:30:25.681
Seemed clear-headed.

01:30:25.806 --> 01:30:29.519
Would you say he was
in complete possession of his faculties?

01:30:30.019 --> 01:30:31.562
He seemed so to me.

01:30:31.771 --> 01:30:32.772
Your witness.

01:30:33.189 --> 01:30:37.526
You testified that Lt. Manion
told you that he shot Barney Quill...

01:30:37.610 --> 01:30:41.614
...after he had learned that his wife
had had some trouble with Quill.

01:30:42.156 --> 01:30:45.576
Were these the words
Lt. Manion used: "some trouble"?

01:30:45.952 --> 01:30:47.912
No, sir. Those were my words, not his.

01:30:48.246 --> 01:30:50.831
Was it your notion to use your own words?

01:30:50.957 --> 01:30:52.750
No, sir, it was not.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.169
Was the suggestion
to call it "some trouble"...

01:30:55.252 --> 01:30:57.838
...made by somebody in this courtroom?

01:31:00.049 --> 01:31:01.342
Yes, sir, it was.

01:31:02.551 --> 01:31:07.306
Would you tell the court
what words Lt. Manion actually used...

01:31:07.390 --> 01:31:09.433
...to describe the trouble his wife had?

01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:12.353
Objection. We've been over this before.

01:31:12.478 --> 01:31:15.523
This would not be relevant
to any issues before the court.

01:31:15.606 --> 01:31:20.861
The statement "some trouble" came out
during the examination of Sgt. Durgo.

01:31:21.404 --> 01:31:26.534
Up to now, you've adroitly restricted
all testimony concerning Laura Manion.

01:31:26.784 --> 01:31:30.246
The cat's out of the bag,
it's fair game for me to chase it.

01:31:30.454 --> 01:31:33.666
This is a sore point, Mr. Biegler,
and it's getting sorer.

01:31:33.916 --> 01:31:35.501
I'd like to hear the prosecution.

01:31:36.085 --> 01:31:37.753
The burden is on the defence...

01:31:37.837 --> 01:31:40.714
...to prove temporary insanity
at the time of the shooting.

01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:44.760
If the reason for the alleged insanity
is important to this case...

01:31:44.885 --> 01:31:47.388
...then it's a matter
for a competent witness.

01:31:47.471 --> 01:31:50.182
An expert on the subject
of the human mind.

01:31:51.225 --> 01:31:53.811
What the defence is trying to do...

01:31:53.894 --> 01:31:56.647
...is introduce some sensational material...

01:31:56.814 --> 01:31:59.692
...for the purposes of obscuring
the real issues.

01:32:00.859 --> 01:32:05.573
Your Honour, how can the jury accurately
estimate the testimony being given here...

01:32:05.656 --> 01:32:09.034
...unless they first know the reason
behind this whole trial:

01:32:09.201 --> 01:32:12.079
Why Lt. Manion shot Barney Quill?

01:32:12.162 --> 01:32:15.958
Now, the prosecution would like
to separate the motive from the act.

01:32:17.001 --> 01:32:21.171
That's like trying to take the core
from an apple without breaking the skin.

01:32:21.255 --> 01:32:26.176
The core of our defence is that
the defendant's temporary insanity...

01:32:26.468 --> 01:32:29.638
...was triggered by this
so-called trouble with Quill.

01:32:29.722 --> 01:32:31.765
I beg the court...

01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:36.395
I beg the court to let me cut into the apple.

01:32:38.522 --> 01:32:40.816
Our objection still stands, Your Honour.

01:32:55.581 --> 01:32:57.166
Objection overruled.

01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:09.553
Tell the court how Lt. Manion
described the trouble...

01:33:09.678 --> 01:33:11.555
...his wife had with Barney Quill.

01:33:11.805 --> 01:33:14.725
He told us that Quill had raped his wife.

01:33:15.058 --> 01:33:19.271
Can you recall what Lt. Manion
told you about the rape?

01:33:19.771 --> 01:33:20.981
Yes, sir.

01:33:21.106 --> 01:33:23.859
He said he'd been asleep
since right after dinner.

01:33:24.318 --> 01:33:28.113
He was waked up by some noise,
screams, he thought.

01:33:28.447 --> 01:33:32.326
He got up,
opened the trailer door and went outside.

01:33:32.534 --> 01:33:35.662
His wife came running out of the dark
and fell into his arms.

01:33:36.079 --> 01:33:38.915
You saw his wife in the trailer.
How'd she look?

01:33:38.999 --> 01:33:42.127
She was a little hysterical.
She'd been pretty badly beaten up.

01:33:42.210 --> 01:33:45.088
She had big, black bruises
over her face and arms.

01:33:45.339 --> 01:33:48.133
Did Mrs. Manion tell you
about this rape and beating?

01:33:48.216 --> 01:33:49.301
She did.

01:33:49.426 --> 01:33:51.428
Did she take you to where it happened?

01:33:51.511 --> 01:33:52.721
Yes, the next morning.

01:33:52.846 --> 01:33:54.181
Did you find anything?

01:33:54.264 --> 01:33:58.018
Any evidence pertaining to the story
that Mrs. Manion had told you?

01:33:58.727 --> 01:34:03.231
On the lane in the woods,
we found tyre tracks and dog tracks...

01:34:03.690 --> 01:34:07.527
...and a leather case
with some horn-rimmed glasses inside.

01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:13.992
We also looked for a certain undergarment
of Mrs. Manion's, but we didn't find it.

01:34:14.326 --> 01:34:18.163
Will the attorneys for both sides
approach the bench, please?

01:34:21.082 --> 01:34:25.045
Mr. Biegler, you finally got
your rape into the case...

01:34:25.253 --> 01:34:29.090
...and I think all the details
should now be made clear to the jury.

01:34:29.174 --> 01:34:30.800
Do you agree, Mr. Lodwick?

01:34:31.384 --> 01:34:32.385
Absolutely.

01:34:33.094 --> 01:34:36.556
What exactly was the undergarment
just referred to?

01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:38.225
Panties, Your Honour.

01:34:38.308 --> 01:34:40.518
Do you expect this subject
to come up again?

01:34:40.602 --> 01:34:41.978
Yes, sir.

01:34:42.103 --> 01:34:46.274
There's a certain light connotation
attached to the word "panties."

01:34:46.524 --> 01:34:48.526
Can we find another name for them?

01:34:48.610 --> 01:34:51.196
I've never heard my wife
call them anything else.

01:34:52.656 --> 01:34:54.532
I'm a bachelor, Your Honour.

01:34:54.616 --> 01:34:57.410
That's a great help. Mr. Dancer?

01:34:57.494 --> 01:35:02.165
When I was overseas during the war,
Your Honour, I learned a French word.

01:35:02.374 --> 01:35:04.876
I'm afraid it might be slightly suggestive.

01:35:04.959 --> 01:35:06.753
Most French words are.

01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:09.464
All right, gentlemen, back to your places.

01:35:10.757 --> 01:35:15.136
For the benefit of the jury,
but more especially for the spectators...

01:35:15.428 --> 01:35:19.307
...the undergarment referred to
in the testimony was, to be exact...

01:35:19.682 --> 01:35:21.351
...Mrs. Manion's panties.

01:35:25.438 --> 01:35:29.150
I wanted you to get
your snickering over and done with.

01:35:29.275 --> 01:35:33.446
This pair of panties will be mentioned
again in the course of this trial.

01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:38.284
When it happens, there will not be
one laugh, one snicker, one giggle...

01:35:38.409 --> 01:35:41.162
...or even one smirk in my courtroom.

01:35:41.412 --> 01:35:45.208
There isn't anything comic
about a pair of panties...

01:35:45.291 --> 01:35:48.795
...which figure in the violent death
of one man...

01:35:48.878 --> 01:35:52.215
...and the possible incarceration of another.

01:35:53.007 --> 01:35:54.467
Proceed, Mr. Biegler.

01:35:54.551 --> 01:35:57.053
Did you give Mrs. Manion
a lie-detector test?

01:35:57.136 --> 01:36:00.473
Objection. A polygraph test
is inadmissible evidence in our courts.

01:36:00.557 --> 01:36:03.768
I only asked if he gave the test.
I didn't ask the results.

01:36:04.102 --> 01:36:05.561
He may answer that.

01:36:06.104 --> 01:36:09.023
I gave her a lie-detector test
at her request.

01:36:09.190 --> 01:36:12.777
Now, after all this investigation,
did you believe Mrs. Manion?

01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:13.903
I did.

01:36:13.987 --> 01:36:17.198
- Even after the lie-detector test?
- I object to that question.

01:36:17.281 --> 01:36:21.285
It constitutes flagrant subterfuge
on the part of the defence counsel.

01:36:21.369 --> 01:36:23.204
Objection sustained.

01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:27.500
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
a polygraph or lie-detector test...

01:36:27.583 --> 01:36:31.421
...is not admissible in evidence,
because no one has ever been sure...

01:36:31.546 --> 01:36:35.258
...that some people couldn't lie
to a lie detector and get away with it.

01:36:35.550 --> 01:36:36.843
Go ahead.

01:36:37.260 --> 01:36:41.389
In any case, Sgt. Durgo, you, yourself,
in your own heart and mind...

01:36:41.472 --> 01:36:43.850
...are quite convinced
of Mrs. Manion's honesty.

01:36:44.058 --> 01:36:45.977
- Yes, sir.
- That's all.

01:36:48.020 --> 01:36:49.647
Just a moment.

01:36:55.027 --> 01:36:58.364
Did you look for the panties
elsewhere than the lane in the woods?

01:36:58.447 --> 01:37:01.742
We looked in Barney Quill's car
and his room in the hotel.

01:37:01.826 --> 01:37:03.244
We didn't find the panties.

01:37:03.327 --> 01:37:06.414
Do you know why Mrs. Manion
requested a lie-detector test?

01:37:06.789 --> 01:37:08.791
- I know what she said.
- What was that?

01:37:08.875 --> 01:37:12.837
She wanted everybody to believe her story
as she knew it would help her husband.

01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:14.630
Was that the only reason she gave?

01:37:14.881 --> 01:37:18.843
Said she'd already sworn to her husband
and she wanted everybody to believe it.

01:37:18.926 --> 01:37:21.137
One moment please, Your Honour.

01:37:24.599 --> 01:37:26.809
Ask him in what manner she swore.

01:37:27.351 --> 01:37:30.605
Did Mrs. Manion say
how she had sworn to her husband?

01:37:30.771 --> 01:37:33.649
Yes, sir.
She said she had sworn on a rosary.

01:37:35.109 --> 01:37:39.280
Sergeant, this lane in the woods:
What's it used for? Where does it go?

01:37:39.655 --> 01:37:42.950
It used to be a logging road.
Doesn't go any place, just stops.

01:37:43.034 --> 01:37:44.410
Who uses it now?

01:37:44.994 --> 01:37:47.204
I think it's a road kids drive down to park.

01:37:47.288 --> 01:37:49.915
- It's a lovers' lane?
- I think so, yes.

01:37:49.999 --> 01:37:52.585
- The witness is yours.
- No more questions.

01:37:52.710 --> 01:37:54.170
The witness may step down.

01:37:54.253 --> 01:37:58.758
In view of the evidence concerning rape,
which Your Honour has ruled admissible...

01:37:58.841 --> 01:38:01.677
...we ask for a 30-minute recess
in order that we may...

01:38:01.761 --> 01:38:04.346
...bring in a witness
we had not anticipated using.

01:38:04.638 --> 01:38:06.932
All right, we'll take a 30-minute recess.

01:38:07.016 --> 01:38:08.476
Recess.

01:38:15.399 --> 01:38:18.110
Why didn't you tell me about that rosary?

01:38:19.236 --> 01:38:20.738
We forgot it.

01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:25.743
We didn't forget it. Manny said,
maybe we shouldn't tell that again.

01:38:26.243 --> 01:38:30.497
It might've looked like something else.
Like I didn't believe her.

01:38:31.248 --> 01:38:33.167
How much more didn't you tell me?

01:38:33.250 --> 01:38:36.503
Everything else.
We told you everything else.

01:38:36.629 --> 01:38:38.339
Is that right, Laura?

01:38:38.505 --> 01:38:40.382
Yes, everything else.

01:38:40.549 --> 01:38:42.801
All right, now get this, both of you:

01:38:42.927 --> 01:38:46.680
When you get up on that stand,
I want you to tell the truth.

01:38:46.847 --> 01:38:49.308
I don't want you to tell anything
but the truth.

01:38:49.391 --> 01:38:54.104
Don't try and lie or conceal anything,
or you'll get skinned alive.

01:38:54.605 --> 01:38:56.982
This fellow Dancer's gonna move in.

01:39:18.128 --> 01:39:21.548
Doctor Dompierre, did you have occasion
to come to the county jail...

01:39:21.632 --> 01:39:23.675
...the night of August 15 of this year?

01:39:23.759 --> 01:39:24.802
I did.

01:39:24.927 --> 01:39:27.930
- Who called you to the jail?
- The police authorities.

01:39:28.013 --> 01:39:30.057
What did they want you to do?

01:39:30.182 --> 01:39:33.227
They wanted me to make a test
for the presence of sperm...

01:39:33.310 --> 01:39:35.479
...on the person
of a Mrs. Frederick Manion.

01:39:35.562 --> 01:39:36.647
I made the test.

01:39:36.730 --> 01:39:39.525
In making this test,
what was your conclusion?

01:39:39.608 --> 01:39:41.443
Negative. There was none.

01:39:41.527 --> 01:39:43.529
Your witness, Mr. Biegler.

01:39:44.071 --> 01:39:47.324
In making these tests,
did you notice any bruises or marks...

01:39:47.407 --> 01:39:49.117
...on Mrs. Manion at that time?

01:39:49.201 --> 01:39:50.244
I did.

01:39:50.327 --> 01:39:52.913
Were you asked about
the reason for these bruises?

01:39:52.996 --> 01:39:54.289
I was not.

01:39:54.373 --> 01:39:57.292
Where did you do the lab work
on your test for sperm?

01:39:57.417 --> 01:39:59.378
St. Margaret's Hospital in this city.

01:39:59.878 --> 01:40:03.674
- Who worked up the slides for you?
- A technician at the hospital.

01:40:04.424 --> 01:40:08.512
Wouldn't it have been better to have
these slides worked up by a pathologist...

01:40:08.595 --> 01:40:10.347
...or an expert in this field?

01:40:10.430 --> 01:40:12.975
Yes, but the police were in a hurry.

01:40:13.058 --> 01:40:15.727
I knew this fellow came on at 7:00 a.m.

01:40:15.852 --> 01:40:18.647
Wouldn't it have been better
to wait for the expert...

01:40:18.730 --> 01:40:21.441
...if the possible question of rape
hung on the result?

01:40:21.525 --> 01:40:22.651
It would've been.

01:40:22.901 --> 01:40:25.862
In the newspaper,
on the evening of August 16...

01:40:25.946 --> 01:40:28.990
...it was stated you found
no evidence of rape. Is that true?

01:40:29.282 --> 01:40:31.618
It is not true. I made no such statement.

01:40:31.702 --> 01:40:35.789
Did you form an opinion as to
whether Mrs. Manion had been raped?

01:40:35.872 --> 01:40:37.707
- No.
- Why didn't you form an opinion?

01:40:38.083 --> 01:40:42.337
It's impossible to tell if a mature,
married woman has been raped.

01:40:42.504 --> 01:40:43.797
That's all.

01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:48.426
Did you have an opinion about whether
she'd had any recent relations with a man?

01:40:48.844 --> 01:40:51.680
Insofar as no sperm was present...

01:40:51.763 --> 01:40:55.225
...it didn't appear that she had had
recent relations with a man.

01:40:55.308 --> 01:40:56.893
Just one more question:

01:40:56.977 --> 01:40:59.646
The fact that no evidence was present
in her body...

01:40:59.729 --> 01:41:02.065
...does not mean that she was not raped,
does it?

01:41:02.148 --> 01:41:03.191
No.

01:41:03.275 --> 01:41:05.777
Do you know what constitutes rape
under the law?

01:41:05.986 --> 01:41:09.531
Yes, sir. Violation is sufficient for rape.

01:41:10.198 --> 01:41:12.909
- There need not be a completion.
- No further questions.

01:41:12.993 --> 01:41:14.452
The witness may step down.

01:41:14.536 --> 01:41:17.455
The People recall Alphonse Paquette
to the stand.

01:41:17.789 --> 01:41:21.710
Your Honour, since counsel for the defence
has forced the question of rape...

01:41:21.793 --> 01:41:25.046
...it's necessary to take
additional testimony from Mr. Paquette.

01:41:26.381 --> 01:41:28.508
You're still under oath, Mr. Paquette.

01:41:31.136 --> 01:41:34.389
Will you look at Mrs. Manion,
seated behind the defence table?

01:41:34.514 --> 01:41:37.225
Was she dressed like this
on the night of the shooting?

01:41:37.309 --> 01:41:38.893
- No.
- How was she dressed?

01:41:39.019 --> 01:41:43.940
She had on a real tight skirt
and sweater kind of thing, sort of glued on.

01:41:44.399 --> 01:41:46.735
She was wearing
red shoes with high heels.

01:41:46.818 --> 01:41:48.445
Was she wearing hose?

01:41:48.987 --> 01:41:50.321
No, she was bare-legged.

01:41:50.447 --> 01:41:52.365
- Was she wearing a hat?
- No.

01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:57.162
What kind of hair does Mrs. Manion have
under that hat?

01:41:57.287 --> 01:42:00.290
We'd be very happy to show the court
Mrs. Manion's hair.

01:42:00.457 --> 01:42:03.752
Mrs. Manion,
would you take off your hat, please?

01:42:09.382 --> 01:42:11.134
Thank you, Mr. Biegler.

01:42:11.301 --> 01:42:14.554
Mr. Paquette, was she wearing glasses
that night?

01:42:14.929 --> 01:42:17.098
I think she was when she played pinball.

01:42:17.182 --> 01:42:21.352
Considering the tight skirt
and the tight sweater and the bare legs...

01:42:21.978 --> 01:42:24.898
...what was the result in her appearance?

01:42:25.023 --> 01:42:29.319
Would you say Mrs. Manion's appearance
was deliberately voluptuous and enticing?

01:42:29.611 --> 01:42:31.821
You could pretty much see
everything she had.

01:42:31.905 --> 01:42:35.491
The defence will concede that Mrs. Manion,
when dressed informally...

01:42:35.575 --> 01:42:37.660
...is an astonishingly beautiful woman.

01:42:38.328 --> 01:42:40.371
Mrs. Manion, stand up, please.

01:42:40.705 --> 01:42:46.002
As a matter of fact, it's pretty easy
to understand why her husband...

01:42:46.085 --> 01:42:50.965
...became temporarily deranged, seeing
such beauty bruised and torn by a beast.

01:42:51.966 --> 01:42:53.176
I protest.

01:42:53.259 --> 01:42:55.345
Mr. Biegler is the least disciplined...

01:42:55.470 --> 01:42:59.015
...and the most completely out-of-order
attorney I've ever seen.

01:42:59.140 --> 01:43:02.101
The jury will ignore Mr. Biegler's oration.

01:43:05.730 --> 01:43:08.691
Was Mrs. Manion drinking heavily
that night?

01:43:08.858 --> 01:43:12.612
I sold her six drinks myself,
and then Barney got some more for her.

01:43:12.695 --> 01:43:14.072
I don't remember how many.

01:43:14.155 --> 01:43:15.948
Would you say that she was tight?

01:43:16.074 --> 01:43:17.116
She was high all right.

01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:19.494
What did she do
to make you think she was high?

01:43:19.577 --> 01:43:22.121
She took off her shoes
and went barefooted.

01:43:22.246 --> 01:43:23.998
When she played pinball...

01:43:24.081 --> 01:43:26.709
...she'd swish around
to give the machine inkling.

01:43:26.834 --> 01:43:30.630
You mean,
she was flipping her hips around?

01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:32.507
Anything else?

01:43:32.965 --> 01:43:37.929
When she made a good score, she jumped
up and down and squealed like women do.

01:43:38.137 --> 01:43:41.307
She was playing pinball
with Barney Quill that night, wasn't she?

01:43:41.432 --> 01:43:43.643
What was her attitude
toward Barney Quill?

01:43:43.976 --> 01:43:45.269
Friendly, I guess.

01:43:45.394 --> 01:43:46.979
More than friendly?

01:43:47.146 --> 01:43:49.357
- I thought so.
- Why did you think so?

01:43:50.149 --> 01:43:53.069
She'd kind of lean on him...

01:43:53.194 --> 01:43:56.656
...and a couple of times
she bumped him with her hip.

01:43:57.448 --> 01:44:00.826
Would you say that Mrs. Manion
was making a play for Barney Quill?

01:44:01.410 --> 01:44:05.539
Objection. That calls for an assumption
on the part of the witness.

01:44:05.790 --> 01:44:09.835
Would you say that Mrs. Manion
was free and easy with Barney Quill?

01:44:09.919 --> 01:44:10.920
I would.

01:44:11.003 --> 01:44:12.088
Your witness.

01:44:13.714 --> 01:44:17.677
The attorney for the People asked you
if Mrs. Manion was "tight"...

01:44:17.802 --> 01:44:20.096
...and you said she was "high."

01:44:21.013 --> 01:44:24.183
Speaking as a bartender,
what's the distinction between the two?

01:44:24.266 --> 01:44:26.394
I don't think I understand.

01:44:27.395 --> 01:44:31.065
When we say a person is tight,
we usually mean they're a little...

01:44:31.190 --> 01:44:33.234
...stupid with drink, isn't that so?

01:44:33.317 --> 01:44:34.902
I guess that's about it, yes.

01:44:35.069 --> 01:44:37.947
If they're high,
they're gay and enjoying themselves.

01:44:38.072 --> 01:44:39.115
Yes.

01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:41.659
In other words, Mrs. Manion was happy.

01:44:41.742 --> 01:44:44.995
Is there anything wrong with being happy
in Thunder Bay Inn?

01:44:45.204 --> 01:44:50.835
Thunder Bay itself is a resort, isn't it?
Swimming, fishing, that sort of thing?

01:44:51.502 --> 01:44:55.673
Is there anything unusual about seeing
a barefooted woman in Thunder Bay?

01:44:55.840 --> 01:44:58.926
So, Mrs. Manion's taking her shoes off
in Thunder Bay...

01:44:59.009 --> 01:45:02.263
...doesn't necessarily mean
she was being unladylike, does it?

01:45:02.346 --> 01:45:03.764
- I guess not.
- Yes or no?

01:45:03.848 --> 01:45:04.890
No.

01:45:07.810 --> 01:45:12.982
You testified that Mrs. Manion
was squealing and jumping up and down...

01:45:15.150 --> 01:45:20.281
...and "swishing her hips"
around the pinball machine.

01:45:20.572 --> 01:45:24.118
Was she creating a disturbance?
Was she attracting a crowd?

01:45:24.368 --> 01:45:27.871
Were all the men at the bar
standing around watching Mrs. Manion?

01:45:27.997 --> 01:45:30.165
But you were very conscious
of Mrs. Manion.

01:45:30.249 --> 01:45:33.168
You were so conscious
that you can tell us all this.

01:45:33.335 --> 01:45:37.756
Barney Quill was conscious of Mrs. Manion
because he was playing pinball with her.

01:45:37.881 --> 01:45:39.133
Wouldn't you say so?

01:45:39.258 --> 01:45:44.096
So, it seems only you and Barney Quill
were acutely aware of Mrs. Manion...

01:45:44.179 --> 01:45:46.098
...her actions and her appearance.

01:45:46.223 --> 01:45:49.393
Maybe when good old Barney
came to get some drinks from you...

01:45:49.518 --> 01:45:53.647
...maybe he winked and said,
"I'm gonna take this babe and rape her."

01:45:53.731 --> 01:45:54.815
No, he didn't.

01:45:54.940 --> 01:45:57.818
Yeah, and maybe you said,
"Do it once for me, boss."

01:45:57.901 --> 01:46:00.154
Objection!
Counsel is attacking the witness.

01:46:00.237 --> 01:46:01.989
No more questions.

01:46:02.865 --> 01:46:06.660
The court's had about all of this dogfight
it can take for one day.

01:46:06.785 --> 01:46:10.122
I'm sure the jury
is equally tired and hungry.

01:46:10.456 --> 01:46:12.249
Tomorrow, the defence takes over.

01:46:12.374 --> 01:46:15.377
With expedition, prayer,
and a little self-discipline...

01:46:15.460 --> 01:46:19.590
...on the part of the counsel, perhaps
we can reach an end by Saturday night.

01:46:19.673 --> 01:46:21.633
Will you adjourn court?

01:46:24.178 --> 01:46:27.598
This court stands adjourned
until 9:00 a.m. Tomorrow.

01:47:09.056 --> 01:47:11.850
He's banged up a little, but nothing else.

01:47:11.933 --> 01:47:14.478
We'd like to watch him for a day or so.

01:47:14.561 --> 01:47:16.521
How much damage did he do?

01:47:16.605 --> 01:47:21.818
He wrecked a gate and a barn door
and he hasn't got a driver's license.

01:47:23.570 --> 01:47:28.658
He'll have to appear in the J.P. Court
when he's able, the old fool.

01:47:29.159 --> 01:47:31.244
Speak kindly of the dead.

01:47:31.536 --> 01:47:34.581
- Can I have a minute with the corpse?
- Sure, Pauly.

01:47:39.961 --> 01:47:44.674
Was it worth trying to kill yourself
for whatever it is you've been up to?

01:47:45.258 --> 01:47:46.968
How's the trial going?

01:47:47.052 --> 01:47:51.097
I'm making a lot of noise.
Dancer's racking up all the points.

01:47:51.181 --> 01:47:52.933
Where've you been?

01:47:53.934 --> 01:47:57.395
Quill hired Mary Pilant
up north of Sault Sainte Marie.

01:47:58.104 --> 01:48:02.150
It struck me funny he'd go up there
to hire somebody just to work for him.

01:48:02.233 --> 01:48:04.569
I've been up there nosing around.

01:48:04.694 --> 01:48:06.780
Did you find anything useful?

01:48:06.863 --> 01:48:09.783
Not until I looked up her birth certificate.

01:48:10.075 --> 01:48:15.080
Born: Blind River, Ontario, 1934,
out of wedlock.

01:48:15.622 --> 01:48:19.125
Mother was a waitress. Simone Platt.

01:48:19.876 --> 01:48:24.214
Father was a lumberjack
named Barney Quill.

01:48:32.013 --> 01:48:34.391
I'd like to see Miss Mary Pilant.

01:48:34.516 --> 01:48:35.642
It's late, mister.

01:48:35.725 --> 01:48:37.727
I know. This is important.

01:48:37.811 --> 01:48:39.979
- Real important?
- Real important.

01:48:45.193 --> 01:48:48.112
Miss Pilant? Sorry if I woke you.
There's a guy to see you.

01:48:48.196 --> 01:48:49.531
Says it's important.

01:48:49.614 --> 01:48:50.990
- What's your...
- Biegler.

01:48:51.866 --> 01:48:53.159
<i>I don't wish to see him.</i>

01:48:55.703 --> 01:48:58.289
She said it's not important enough.

01:48:58.456 --> 01:49:01.918
You call her back and tell her
I mentioned Blind River, Ontario.

01:49:02.085 --> 01:49:03.878
I'll be in the bar.

01:49:21.938 --> 01:49:24.315
Drinking, Mr. Biegler, or just snooping?

01:49:24.649 --> 01:49:26.192
I'll try a little of both.

01:49:26.276 --> 01:49:29.070
What do you say we start out with a beer?

01:49:33.366 --> 01:49:34.617
On the house.

01:49:34.701 --> 01:49:38.496
That's all you get: A beer.
No questions, no answers.

01:49:38.788 --> 01:49:41.040
I'm just a lawyer trying to do my job.

01:49:41.124 --> 01:49:43.167
What are you so afraid of, Al?

01:49:46.421 --> 01:49:48.089
Sit over there, please.

01:49:54.345 --> 01:49:56.806
Miss Pilant, I owe you an apology.

01:49:56.889 --> 01:49:59.517
I was a little rough
when I was out here before.

01:49:59.976 --> 01:50:02.145
I didn't know Barney Quill was your father.

01:50:02.228 --> 01:50:04.230
You didn't come here just to apologise.

01:50:05.022 --> 01:50:06.941
No, but the apology was part of it.

01:50:07.066 --> 01:50:11.487
To tell the truth, I sort of hoped
maybe it would thaw you out a bit.

01:50:11.863 --> 01:50:15.825
All I want you to do is listen to me,
just for a few minutes.

01:50:16.659 --> 01:50:20.955
I need some strong evidence to back up
Laura Manion's story about the rape.

01:50:21.038 --> 01:50:24.584
The prosecution's gonna attack
that story pretty hard.

01:50:25.293 --> 01:50:29.964
If the jury thinks she's lying,
it could turn the decision against Manion.

01:50:30.256 --> 01:50:35.011
Isn't she lying? Barney didn't do
what she said he did. He couldn't have.

01:50:35.803 --> 01:50:37.638
What did you know about your father?

01:50:37.722 --> 01:50:42.893
All I needed to know. He took care of me
and my mother for as long as she lived.

01:50:43.686 --> 01:50:46.605
He was always there when I needed him.

01:50:46.772 --> 01:50:51.652
That's what I know about my father.
Will that back up Laura Manion's story?

01:50:51.736 --> 01:50:54.780
I don't want to get at you.
I don't want to hurt you.

01:50:54.905 --> 01:50:57.199
I appreciate your affection for your father.

01:50:58.576 --> 01:51:03.164
But, as a lawyer, I've had to learn
that people aren't just good or just bad.

01:51:03.247 --> 01:51:05.332
People are many things.

01:51:05.458 --> 01:51:08.711
I kind of have a feeling
that Barney Quill was many things.

01:51:08.794 --> 01:51:10.046
I don't wanna hear it.

01:51:10.713 --> 01:51:14.300
Please, hear me out.
I believe that Barney told Al Paquette...

01:51:14.383 --> 01:51:16.135
...what happened that night.

01:51:16.218 --> 01:51:19.430
He told him to go to this window
and wait for Manion.

01:51:19.513 --> 01:51:22.641
Barney stayed behind the bar,
next to a gun rack.

01:51:22.725 --> 01:51:23.851
Just waiting.

01:51:24.268 --> 01:51:27.897
Manion came in and fired
the minute he got inside that door...

01:51:27.980 --> 01:51:30.441
...and the first shot
went through Barney's heart.

01:51:30.524 --> 01:51:32.902
Here's what I want you to do.

01:51:32.985 --> 01:51:37.531
I want you to try and persuade Al
to come to court as a defence witness...

01:51:37.615 --> 01:51:40.492
...and tell them exactly
what Barney told him that night:

01:51:40.701 --> 01:51:43.621
That he'd raped
and assaulted Mrs. Manion.

01:51:44.121 --> 01:51:48.334
Al wouldn't conceal a thing like that.
Why wouldn't he tell it if it were true?

01:51:48.417 --> 01:51:50.419
I don't know.

01:51:50.502 --> 01:51:55.215
But I know this:
Everybody loves something or someone.

01:51:55.674 --> 01:51:59.637
Me, I love fishing
and an old guy by the name of Parnell.

01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:03.223
Manion loves his freedom,
he'd like to have a little more of it.

01:52:03.307 --> 01:52:06.602
Barney loved you, maybe so does Al.

01:52:07.645 --> 01:52:09.480
I wouldn't blame him.

01:52:09.563 --> 01:52:13.400
But he doesn't want to hurt you.
He doesn't want you to know the truth:

01:52:13.525 --> 01:52:17.738
That Barney could be dangerous and brutal.
If you just ask Al...

01:52:17.821 --> 01:52:19.865
If you just ask him straight out...

01:52:30.084 --> 01:52:35.130
Mr. Biegler knows
that Barney was my father.

01:52:35.214 --> 01:52:38.967
He thinks you know something
about the night my father was killed.

01:52:39.051 --> 01:52:40.969
Something you won't tell.

01:52:41.303 --> 01:52:45.224
Lawyer, I told you once, I'll tell you again:
No questions, no answers.

01:52:45.307 --> 01:52:46.683
Wait, Al.

01:52:49.102 --> 01:52:52.231
Did my father rape Mrs. Manion?

01:52:52.564 --> 01:52:54.858
Barney wouldn't hurt a woman.

01:52:56.318 --> 01:53:00.405
Is there any reason
you wouldn't tell me the truth about that?

01:53:00.948 --> 01:53:02.407
What reason?

01:53:09.081 --> 01:53:10.207
Anything else, Mr. Biegler?

01:53:11.667 --> 01:53:14.503
I'm gonna leave a pass
for you and Al at the trial.

01:53:14.711 --> 01:53:18.131
You might like to watch
Lt. Manion get convicted.

01:53:18.423 --> 01:53:20.550
You gonna talk about
Mary being Barney's kid?

01:53:20.676 --> 01:53:24.471
No, I'm not gonna spread it around, Al.
Thank you for the beer.

01:53:24.721 --> 01:53:26.264
- Good night.
- 'Night.

01:53:31.061 --> 01:53:33.063
All right, now let's get at this rosary thing.

01:53:33.313 --> 01:53:36.525
It's been testified
that your wife swore to you on a rosary...

01:53:36.608 --> 01:53:38.902
...that she'd been raped by Barney Quill.

01:53:39.069 --> 01:53:42.322
Now, did you ask your wife
to swear on a rosary?

01:53:42.781 --> 01:53:45.826
My wife was hysterical
and she wasn't making much sense.

01:53:46.284 --> 01:53:50.664
I thought if I asked her to take an oath
on a rosary it might serve to calm her.

01:53:50.747 --> 01:53:52.207
Make her think more clearly.

01:53:52.290 --> 01:53:54.126
Did the rosary help?

01:53:54.334 --> 01:53:56.920
She was able to tell me, in detail,
what had happened.

01:53:57.003 --> 01:54:00.215
All right, go on from there.
Now, what did you do then?

01:54:02.801 --> 01:54:07.931
I had her lie on the bed
and I got some cold cloths for her head.

01:54:10.517 --> 01:54:12.811
I gave her a drink of brandy.

01:54:14.813 --> 01:54:18.483
After a while, she became calm
and seemed to go to sleep.

01:54:19.484 --> 01:54:24.239
Then I went to the closet,
I got my gun and I loaded it.

01:54:24.364 --> 01:54:28.618
- Was it in your mind to kill Barney Quill?
- No.

01:54:28.702 --> 01:54:32.414
Then why did you go to the closet
and get your gun and load it?

01:54:32.497 --> 01:54:35.166
I knew I had to go to his place,
I thought I'd need it.

01:54:35.250 --> 01:54:36.293
Why?

01:54:37.127 --> 01:54:41.756
I knew Mr. Quill kept guns behind the bar.
I was afraid he might shoot me.

01:54:41.881 --> 01:54:45.719
Might shoot you if you did what?
What were you going to do?

01:54:46.511 --> 01:54:48.013
I'm not sure.

01:54:49.014 --> 01:54:53.143
I remember having some idea
of finding him...

01:54:54.352 --> 01:54:56.896
...and holding him while I called the police.

01:54:57.397 --> 01:54:59.149
Well, that Mr. What's- his-name...

01:54:59.315 --> 01:55:02.402
Mr. Lemon at the tourist court
was a deputy sheriff.

01:55:02.485 --> 01:55:04.446
Why didn't you get him to go with you?

01:55:04.779 --> 01:55:09.367
Maybe because he always seemed to be
just the old caretaker of the park.

01:55:10.493 --> 01:55:15.957
Maybe I wasn't thinking about anything
too clearly, except finding Barney Quill.

01:55:16.332 --> 01:55:19.752
Why didn't you call the state police
before you went to the bar?

01:55:19.961 --> 01:55:21.296
I don't know.

01:55:22.338 --> 01:55:24.090
I was in sort of a daze.

01:55:25.592 --> 01:55:28.720
It was a horrible thing to see
what had been done to my wife.

01:55:28.803 --> 01:55:30.972
You say you were in a sort of a daze.

01:55:31.097 --> 01:55:35.059
When you got to the bar,
did you see that the bar was crowded?

01:55:37.103 --> 01:55:40.523
I didn't see anyone at the bar
except Barney Quill.

01:55:42.901 --> 01:55:44.485
He was the only person I saw.

01:55:44.569 --> 01:55:46.154
What was he doing?

01:55:47.363 --> 01:55:50.700
I think he was just standing there
behind the bar.

01:55:51.910 --> 01:55:54.913
Did he make a threatening move
to get a gun?

01:55:55.121 --> 01:55:56.664
I don't know.

01:55:57.707 --> 01:55:59.417
He may have, I don't know.

01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:03.129
You say you went there to find him,
to hold him for the police?

01:56:04.005 --> 01:56:05.923
Why did you shoot him?

01:56:07.675 --> 01:56:10.011
I don't remember shooting him.

01:56:11.137 --> 01:56:14.891
When you left the bar, do you remember
Alphonse Paquette coming up to you...

01:56:15.016 --> 01:56:17.685
...saying,
"You'd better not run away from this"...

01:56:17.810 --> 01:56:21.230
...and your reply,
"Do you want some, too, buster?"

01:56:21.647 --> 01:56:23.191
Remember that?

01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:28.529
I seem to have a vague recollection
of someone speaking to me...

01:56:29.572 --> 01:56:32.825
...but I don't remember what I said
or what was said to me.

01:56:33.326 --> 01:56:35.870
When did you realize you'd shot Quill?

01:56:39.248 --> 01:56:43.836
I was getting a drink of water.
I remember my throat was so dry it hurt.

01:56:45.797 --> 01:56:50.551
When I put the glass down, I saw the gun
on the kitchen sink beside the tap.

01:56:52.011 --> 01:56:54.263
I noticed the gun was empty.

01:56:54.972 --> 01:56:59.519
I'd like you to show the court and jury...

01:57:00.019 --> 01:57:02.772
...just how you knew this gun was empty.

01:57:03.147 --> 01:57:07.985
This gadget here, when it sticks up,
you know the last round's been fired.

01:57:09.445 --> 01:57:14.033
On the night of the shooting,
did you love your wife?

01:57:14.533 --> 01:57:15.826
Yes, sir.

01:57:16.243 --> 01:57:18.162
Do you still love her?

01:57:21.624 --> 01:57:23.000
Very much.

01:57:23.918 --> 01:57:25.753
The witness is yours, Mr. Dancer.

01:57:29.090 --> 01:57:31.384
How many men have you killed?

01:57:31.550 --> 01:57:33.177
Now, wait a minute!

01:57:33.928 --> 01:57:37.098
A man's war record,
in Lt. Manion's case a great record...

01:57:37.181 --> 01:57:39.141
...shouldn't be used against him.

01:57:39.225 --> 01:57:42.561
I'm as patriotic as the next man...

01:57:42.645 --> 01:57:46.899
...but the simple truth is war can condition
a man to killing other men.

01:57:47.191 --> 01:57:49.110
I just want to know how conditioned...

01:57:49.235 --> 01:57:53.447
...the lieutenant may be to the use
of firearms on other human beings.

01:57:53.656 --> 01:57:55.699
I don't like the question...

01:57:55.783 --> 01:57:59.203
...but I don't see how I can exclude it.
Let him answer.

01:57:59.662 --> 01:58:02.665
I know I killed at least four men in Korea.

01:58:03.332 --> 01:58:07.253
Three with a hand grenade
and one with my service automatic.

01:58:07.586 --> 01:58:11.257
I may have killed others.
A soldier doesn't always know.

01:58:12.091 --> 01:58:15.386
In these acts of killing,
did you ever have a lapse of memory...

01:58:15.469 --> 01:58:18.389
...like when you killed Barney Quill?
- No, sir.

01:58:18.472 --> 01:58:21.475
- Ever have a memory lapse during battle?
- No, sir.

01:58:21.559 --> 01:58:23.978
Were you ever submitted
to a constant barrage...

01:58:24.061 --> 01:58:26.855
...in a sweat for many hours,
constantly under attack?

01:58:27.022 --> 01:58:28.107
Many times.

01:58:28.190 --> 01:58:30.401
Ever treated for shellshock
or war neurosis?

01:58:30.484 --> 01:58:31.610
No, sir.

01:58:31.694 --> 01:58:35.739
Did you ever experience
any unusual mental state during the war?

01:58:36.198 --> 01:58:38.784
- I remember having one great urge.
- What was that?

01:58:38.867 --> 01:58:40.661
To get the hell out and go home.

01:58:42.413 --> 01:58:46.834
You would do well to consider
the seriousness of the situation you are in.

01:58:46.917 --> 01:58:48.168
Sorry, Your Honour.

01:58:48.252 --> 01:58:50.004
I sympathise with the lieutenant.

01:58:50.087 --> 01:58:53.549
I expect he has the same feeling
about getting out of jail.

01:58:53.841 --> 01:58:59.138
The point is that during your service there
was never a record of mental disturbance.

01:58:59.221 --> 01:59:03.183
- You were always completely sane?
- Yes, sir, that's right.

01:59:03.726 --> 01:59:05.144
No more questions.

01:59:05.227 --> 01:59:06.645
No redirect, Your Honour.

01:59:06.729 --> 01:59:09.189
Step down, please. Call your next witness.

01:59:09.273 --> 01:59:11.817
We call Laura Manion to the stand.

01:59:24.079 --> 01:59:26.707
- Up these stairs to the right.
- Thanks.

01:59:33.922 --> 01:59:38.010
How long after you told your husband
what happened did he leave the trailer?

01:59:38.302 --> 01:59:42.097
I don't know exactly.
Everything was kind of fuzzy.

01:59:42.431 --> 01:59:46.685
I was faint and I lay down on the bed,
he sat beside me.

01:59:47.060 --> 01:59:50.188
I vaguely remember
his getting up and going out.

01:59:50.272 --> 01:59:54.818
I remember wondering if he was going
for a doctor, and then he came back in.

01:59:55.193 --> 01:59:58.238
It seemed like just a few seconds,
but it must've been longer.

01:59:58.322 --> 02:00:00.198
I must've gone to sleep.

02:00:00.490 --> 02:00:04.786
When he came back in, he sat on the bed
and he had a gun in his hand.

02:00:05.954 --> 02:00:08.332
And I said, "What are you going to do?"

02:00:08.749 --> 02:00:13.962
He said, "I think I've already done it.
I think I've killed Barney Quill."

02:00:14.087 --> 02:00:17.299
Are you sure he didn't say,
"I've killed Barney Quill"?

02:00:17.716 --> 02:00:21.970
No. I remember distinctly:
"I think I've killed Barney Quill."

02:00:22.345 --> 02:00:24.264
Then what did you do?

02:00:24.347 --> 02:00:28.185
I put my arms around him
and began to cry.

02:00:28.685 --> 02:00:31.646
I said, "You'd better go to Mr. Lemon."

02:00:31.730 --> 02:00:33.774
My husband said, "I forgot about that."

02:00:33.857 --> 02:00:36.818
What did he mean? Forgot about what?

02:00:36.985 --> 02:00:40.113
He meant he'd forgotten
Mr. Lemon was a deputy sheriff.

02:00:40.405 --> 02:00:44.075
And he said,
"Yes, I'll go turn myself in to Mr. Lemon."

02:00:45.076 --> 02:00:47.412
I have no other direct questions
at this time.

02:00:47.996 --> 02:00:51.208
But, since I'm sure it's difficult
to visualise the part...

02:00:51.291 --> 02:00:53.376
...a little dog played on this night...

02:00:53.793 --> 02:00:57.714
...I should like to show the court
this remarkable little animal.

02:00:57.797 --> 02:00:59.674
Do the People object?

02:00:59.758 --> 02:01:01.593
I'm sure if we did...

02:01:01.718 --> 02:01:05.555
...Mr. Biegler would declare
that we're haters of small, furry animals.

02:01:05.680 --> 02:01:09.100
A creature that cannot talk
will be a welcome relief.

02:01:09.184 --> 02:01:11.144
Bring in the dog.

02:01:11.478 --> 02:01:12.520
Thank you, sir.

02:01:12.896 --> 02:01:15.774
Will the deputy bring in the dog, please?

02:01:29.287 --> 02:01:31.623
Now, you can put him right there.

02:01:32.874 --> 02:01:34.042
Come on.

02:01:36.503 --> 02:01:38.213
That's a boy!

02:01:39.464 --> 02:01:43.385
Now, I'll ask Mrs. Manion
to bring a flashlight for the dog.

02:01:54.145 --> 02:01:58.149
I'll ask the court to notice
that the dog turned on the light.

02:02:07.700 --> 02:02:10.912
It's easy to see that Muff doesn't know
who his enemies are.

02:02:10.995 --> 02:02:14.415
Remove the dog, please.
Witness will resume the stand.

02:02:14.499 --> 02:02:15.917
There we go, Muff.

02:02:19.254 --> 02:02:23.341
Mrs. Manion, may I congratulate you
on your well-trained pet.

02:02:23.633 --> 02:02:25.677
May I also say that I'm pleased to see...

02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:29.055
...you are not hiding your lovely hair
under a hat.

02:02:29.514 --> 02:02:32.725
Is the assistant attorney general
from Lansing pitching woo...

02:02:32.809 --> 02:02:34.978
...or is he going to cross-examine?

02:02:35.144 --> 02:02:36.437
Let's get on with it.

02:02:36.521 --> 02:02:38.940
What was your occupation
before you were married?

02:02:39.065 --> 02:02:40.400
Housewife.

02:02:40.525 --> 02:02:41.901
You were married before?

02:02:41.985 --> 02:02:43.277
Yes, once.

02:02:43.361 --> 02:02:45.697
I suppose your first husband died?

02:02:46.739 --> 02:02:47.782
No.

02:02:47.865 --> 02:02:50.910
Did you divorce your first husband
to marry Lt. Manion?

02:02:50.994 --> 02:02:55.081
If counsel wants to know the grounds
for her divorce, let him ask that question.

02:02:55.206 --> 02:02:58.042
- What were they?
- Mental cruelty.

02:02:58.376 --> 02:03:02.505
Naturally. How long after your divorce
did you marry Lt. Manion?

02:03:03.131 --> 02:03:04.424
I'm not sure.

02:03:04.507 --> 02:03:07.218
May I refresh the witness' memory
for Mr. Dancer?

02:03:07.301 --> 02:03:08.428
By all means.

02:03:08.928 --> 02:03:13.641
I believe she told me that they were
married three days after the divorce.

02:03:14.016 --> 02:03:16.310
- Is that correct, Mrs. Manion?
- Yes.

02:03:16.811 --> 02:03:19.480
Then unless yours was
a whirlwind courtship...

02:03:19.564 --> 02:03:22.316
...you must've known Lt. Manion
before your divorce.

02:03:22.775 --> 02:03:23.818
Yes.

02:03:24.694 --> 02:03:27.947
Mrs. Manion,
what is your religious affiliation?

02:03:28.573 --> 02:03:30.158
I'm a Catholic.

02:03:30.575 --> 02:03:31.909
A Catholic in good standing?

02:03:32.285 --> 02:03:33.786
No, the divorce, you know.

02:03:33.870 --> 02:03:36.789
You were ex-communicated
because of the divorce?

02:03:36.873 --> 02:03:37.915
Yes.

02:03:38.541 --> 02:03:40.877
Wouldn't you say that a Catholic...

02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:45.006
...who can blithely ignore
one of the cardinal rules of her Church...

02:03:45.089 --> 02:03:48.467
...could also easily ignore
an oath taken on one of its artefacts?

02:03:48.551 --> 02:03:50.553
Say, an oath taken on a rosary?

02:03:52.722 --> 02:03:54.640
I don't think that's true.

02:03:54.765 --> 02:03:58.728
Wouldn't there be some doubt
about the integrity of such a person?

02:03:58.853 --> 02:04:02.857
I don't know. All I know is
the rosary means something to me.

02:04:03.858 --> 02:04:04.900
I see.

02:04:05.318 --> 02:04:07.695
I'll pass on to something else.

02:04:08.070 --> 02:04:12.491
You testified that your husband came
home late on the night of the shooting.

02:04:12.700 --> 02:04:15.202
Were you a little angry
about his being late?

02:04:15.411 --> 02:04:17.079
I guess I was a little put out.

02:04:17.163 --> 02:04:20.249
- Did you have an argument?
- Not much. A little.

02:04:20.332 --> 02:04:23.961
When you left to go to the inn,
did your husband know you were going?

02:04:24.378 --> 02:04:25.671
He was asleep.

02:04:25.755 --> 02:04:30.718
Was part of your reason for going without
his knowledge because you were vexed?

02:04:31.385 --> 02:04:34.847
I'd been ironing all day...

02:04:35.139 --> 02:04:36.807
Yes, I guess that's true.

02:04:36.891 --> 02:04:39.810
Counsel has deliberately cut off my view
of the witness.

02:04:39.935 --> 02:04:44.023
I'm sorry, Mr. Biegler. I wouldn't interfere
with your signals to Mrs. Manion.

02:04:44.106 --> 02:04:46.484
I object to the implication I was signalling.

02:04:46.567 --> 02:04:49.445
This is the shabbiest courtroom trick
I've ever seen.

02:04:49.528 --> 02:04:51.197
You haven't lived, Mr. Biegler.

02:04:51.363 --> 02:04:53.574
I ask the court to rule on my objection.

02:04:53.699 --> 02:04:58.287
Will you be careful not to place yourself
between Mr. Biegler and his witness?

02:04:58.704 --> 02:05:00.164
Of course, Your Honour.

02:05:00.456 --> 02:05:02.291
Anything else, Mr. Biegler?

02:05:02.374 --> 02:05:07.588
You do it again, I'll punt you all the way
out into the middle of Lake Superior.

02:05:09.089 --> 02:05:11.884
Gentlemen, this rowing has got to stop.

02:05:12.426 --> 02:05:16.430
The next one of you that speaks out of turn
will have me to deal with.

02:05:16.513 --> 02:05:18.641
Now, get on with your cross-examination.

02:05:19.016 --> 02:05:22.019
Would you have gone to the inn
if your husband had been awake?

02:05:22.269 --> 02:05:24.021
He would have gone with me.

02:05:24.104 --> 02:05:25.648
Would you have gone alone?

02:05:25.856 --> 02:05:29.777
- Not if he didn't want me to.
- Would he have not wanted you to?

02:05:29.985 --> 02:05:32.404
I'm not sure.
I don't know how to answer that.

02:05:32.654 --> 02:05:35.324
Had you ever gone
to the Thunder Bay Inn...

02:05:35.407 --> 02:05:38.369
...or elsewhere in Thunder Bay,
alone at night?

02:05:38.577 --> 02:05:40.245
Yes. Sometimes.

02:05:40.579 --> 02:05:42.289
Did your husband know you were going?

02:05:42.372 --> 02:05:47.503
Not always. He goes to sleep early
and sometimes I'm restless.

02:05:47.753 --> 02:05:50.005
Where did you go on these occasions?

02:05:50.089 --> 02:05:54.718
I'd take a walk by the lake,
or to the bingo place, maybe to the inn.

02:05:55.344 --> 02:05:57.429
Did you ever go to meet another man?

02:05:58.138 --> 02:06:00.557
No, I didn't. I never did that.

02:06:00.766 --> 02:06:04.144
You mean to say a lovely woman
like yourself, attractive to men...

02:06:04.561 --> 02:06:06.563
...lonely, restless, that you never...

02:06:06.688 --> 02:06:09.858
Objection, the witness has answered
the question about other men.

02:06:09.942 --> 02:06:12.611
Counsel is now making
a veiled suggestion to the jury.

02:06:12.694 --> 02:06:15.322
I withdraw the question.

02:06:16.031 --> 02:06:21.328
On these occasional excursions into the
night, did you always return home alone?

02:06:21.870 --> 02:06:23.247
Of course.

02:06:23.622 --> 02:06:27.125
You testified that the reason
you got into Barney Quill's car...

02:06:27.209 --> 02:06:29.461
...was that you were afraid
to go home alone.

02:06:29.544 --> 02:06:32.422
Why were you so frightened
on this particular night?

02:06:32.506 --> 02:06:36.343
I said that it was because he told me
bears had been seen around.

02:06:36.426 --> 02:06:39.972
Was this the first time you'd heard
that bears came around Thunder Bay...

02:06:40.055 --> 02:06:43.392
...to pick up scraps?
Had you seen the bears before?

02:06:43.475 --> 02:06:44.476
Yes.

02:06:44.559 --> 02:06:47.187
This was just the first time
you were afraid of them?

02:06:47.270 --> 02:06:49.231
No. I was always afraid of them.

02:06:49.314 --> 02:06:52.776
This was just the first time
you were enough afraid to allow a man...

02:06:52.859 --> 02:06:54.986
...to take you home after an evening prowl?

02:06:55.112 --> 02:06:58.782
Objection. The use of the word "prowl"
is meant to mislead the jury.

02:06:58.865 --> 02:07:00.951
- Sustained.
- I apologise, Mrs. Manion.

02:07:02.035 --> 02:07:04.621
I didn't mean to imply
that you were a huntress.

02:07:04.788 --> 02:07:07.207
Was this the first time
you were enough afraid...

02:07:07.290 --> 02:07:10.710
...to allow a man to take you home
from one of your evening walks?

02:07:12.796 --> 02:07:14.798
It wasn't just that. It was...

02:07:14.881 --> 02:07:17.259
You should be able
to answer that straight off.

02:07:17.384 --> 02:07:19.136
That's a simple enough question.

02:07:19.261 --> 02:07:23.306
How can the witness answer straight off,
if counsel keeps interrupting the answer?

02:07:23.431 --> 02:07:26.601
The witness seemed a little slow to me,
Mr. Biegler.

02:07:26.726 --> 02:07:29.855
However, let her complete her answers
before you interrupt.

02:07:30.313 --> 02:07:34.192
In any case, Mr. Biegler's objection
has given Mrs. Manion sufficient time...

02:07:34.276 --> 02:07:37.445
...to think of an answer.
You've thought of one, haven't you?

02:07:37.529 --> 02:07:39.656
What I was going to say was that...

02:07:39.739 --> 02:07:44.035
...I didn't want to offend Mr. Quill
by making him think I didn't like him.

02:07:44.244 --> 02:07:47.747
He'd been very pleasant to my husband
and me when we'd been in his bar.

02:07:47.956 --> 02:07:49.833
That's very good. Very good indeed.

02:07:50.041 --> 02:07:51.293
Your Honour, please.

02:07:51.584 --> 02:07:55.797
The attorney for the People will reserve
his comments for the arguments.

02:07:55.880 --> 02:07:58.425
I will ask you this question, Mrs. Manion:

02:07:59.259 --> 02:08:03.596
Was this the first time you had been
in Barney Quill's car at night?

02:08:07.183 --> 02:08:09.602
Mrs. Manion, did you hear the question?

02:08:10.437 --> 02:08:11.855
Yes, I heard.

02:08:12.731 --> 02:08:14.733
Yes, it was the first time.

02:08:15.775 --> 02:08:18.153
Would you raise your voice a little?

02:08:18.737 --> 02:08:21.030
I said it was the first time.

02:08:23.992 --> 02:08:26.786
I'm quite concerned about the lost panties.

02:08:26.870 --> 02:08:31.040
Would you describe this article
of clothing to the courtroom?

02:08:31.332 --> 02:08:34.252
They were nylon and had lace up the sides.

02:08:34.335 --> 02:08:38.756
There was a store label in them
from the Smartshop in Phoenix, Arizona.

02:08:38.840 --> 02:08:40.383
What was their colour?

02:08:40.592 --> 02:08:42.177
- I believe white.
- You believe?

02:08:42.302 --> 02:08:44.846
I have white and pink.
They may have been pink.

02:08:44.971 --> 02:08:48.975
You're not sure. Haven't you checked
to see which pair of panties is missing?

02:08:49.684 --> 02:08:53.146
When your husband came home late
and you had this little spat...

02:08:53.354 --> 02:08:55.273
...were you already dressed to go out?

02:08:55.398 --> 02:08:56.941
- No.
- When did you dress?

02:08:57.025 --> 02:08:58.568
After dinner. When he was asleep.

02:08:58.651 --> 02:09:00.945
It's been stated
you were bare-legged in the bar.

02:09:01.029 --> 02:09:02.739
- Is that true?
- Yes.

02:09:02.822 --> 02:09:05.700
In your anger and haste
to get out of the trailer...

02:09:05.783 --> 02:09:07.493
...perhaps you forgot your panties?

02:09:07.577 --> 02:09:10.455
Objection. She testified
as to what she was wearing.

02:09:10.538 --> 02:09:11.581
Sustained.

02:09:11.664 --> 02:09:13.458
Do you always wear panties?

02:09:13.541 --> 02:09:16.127
Your Honour,
I object to this line of questioning.

02:09:16.210 --> 02:09:18.921
Now, it's immaterial
what she does all the time.

02:09:19.005 --> 02:09:21.424
The night of the attack,
she was wearing panties.

02:09:21.507 --> 02:09:23.426
That's all we're concerned with.

02:09:23.551 --> 02:09:28.056
Mrs. Manion seems a little uncertain about
what kind of panties she was wearing.

02:09:28.139 --> 02:09:29.766
Since they've not been found...

02:09:29.891 --> 02:09:33.478
...I submit that it's possible
she wasn't wearing any and has forgotten.

02:09:33.561 --> 02:09:34.979
That's all I'm getting at.

02:09:35.063 --> 02:09:37.315
You may answer, Mrs. Manion.

02:09:38.149 --> 02:09:40.151
Do you always wear panties?

02:09:41.277 --> 02:09:42.528
No.

02:09:42.945 --> 02:09:46.240
On what occasions don't you?
When you go out alone at night?

02:09:46.908 --> 02:09:50.203
Objection. He claims to go after
one thing and goes after another.

02:09:50.286 --> 02:09:52.330
I'll sustain the objection.

02:09:52.413 --> 02:09:55.917
Strike out the last two questions
and Mrs. Manion's answers.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:00.087
Now, Mr. Dancer, get off the panties.
You've done enough damage.

02:10:00.546 --> 02:10:02.256
Yes, Your Honour.

02:10:02.715 --> 02:10:06.344
Mrs. Manion,
is your husband a jealous man?

02:10:06.677 --> 02:10:07.762
He loves me.

02:10:07.887 --> 02:10:10.890
I'm sure of that,
but is he excessively jealous?

02:10:11.057 --> 02:10:15.019
How can the witness answer that?
What's the norm of jealousy?

02:10:15.228 --> 02:10:18.064
Can you put your question differently,
Mr. Dancer?

02:10:18.189 --> 02:10:20.983
Has your husband ever struck you
in a jealous rage?

02:10:21.108 --> 02:10:24.862
Mr. Dancer's fishing now.
What's the relevancy of this question?

02:10:24.946 --> 02:10:26.948
The shoe is squeezing Mr. Biegler's foot.

02:10:27.031 --> 02:10:31.035
In his own words, this isn't a debate,
it's a cross-examination in a murder trial.

02:10:31.118 --> 02:10:33.454
Proceed, Mr. Dancer.

02:10:34.455 --> 02:10:36.082
Mrs. Manion.

02:10:37.458 --> 02:10:40.461
Did you ever go out socially
in Thunder Bay?

02:10:40.795 --> 02:10:42.296
A few times.

02:10:42.588 --> 02:10:44.757
When your husband's outfit moved there...

02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:49.261
...didn't Mr. Quill throw a cocktail party
for the officers and their wives?

02:10:49.345 --> 02:10:53.641
Didn't your husband strike
a young second lieutenant at this party?

02:10:53.974 --> 02:10:56.268
There was a little scuffle. It wasn't much.

02:10:56.435 --> 02:10:59.522
- What was it about?
- I'm not sure I remember.

02:10:59.897 --> 02:11:03.401
- Were you too drunk to remember?
- No, I was not.

02:11:05.694 --> 02:11:09.406
I think it was because the lieutenant
was cutting in too much...

02:11:09.490 --> 02:11:11.200
...when I danced with my husband.

02:11:11.283 --> 02:11:13.244
Shortly afterwards, on the veranda...

02:11:13.327 --> 02:11:17.832
...didn't your husband slap you hard
enough so that you fell against the wall?

02:11:19.166 --> 02:11:20.209
He was drinking.

02:11:20.334 --> 02:11:23.629
- Wasn't it a jealous rage?
- I don't know.

02:11:23.712 --> 02:11:26.006
- Do you remember why he struck you?
- Yes.

02:11:26.090 --> 02:11:30.553
Wasn't he enraged because he thought
you'd encouraged this young lieutenant?

02:11:30.636 --> 02:11:31.887
He might have thought so.

02:11:31.971 --> 02:11:33.722
There are witnesses to this.

02:11:33.806 --> 02:11:36.183
I'll ask you again,
wasn't this a jealous rage?

02:11:36.308 --> 02:11:38.686
I guess you could call it that.

02:11:39.979 --> 02:11:41.730
Now I'll ask you:

02:11:43.607 --> 02:11:47.695
On the night of the shooting,
what did you swear?

02:11:48.028 --> 02:11:50.906
What oath did you take on the rosary?

02:11:51.532 --> 02:11:53.993
It was about Barney Quill raping me.

02:11:54.118 --> 02:11:57.538
Why did you swear on the rosary
that he'd raped you?

02:11:57.705 --> 02:12:00.165
For the reason that he gave:
I was hysterical.

02:12:00.249 --> 02:12:02.167
That is why he asked you to swear.

02:12:02.251 --> 02:12:04.169
- Why did you swear?
- So he'd believe me.

02:12:04.253 --> 02:12:05.295
Why shouldn't he?

02:12:05.379 --> 02:12:08.507
Objection. The reason for the rosary
has been established.

02:12:08.590 --> 02:12:10.342
These questions are immaterial.

02:12:10.426 --> 02:12:13.721
No, I think I'll take the answer, Mr. Biegler.

02:12:13.804 --> 02:12:16.890
I'll ask you again.
Why shouldn't he believe you?

02:12:19.435 --> 02:12:21.395
Because I wasn't making much sense.

02:12:21.520 --> 02:12:23.647
Did he think you'd lie about such a thing?

02:12:23.772 --> 02:12:27.109
Objection. Lt. Manion has already testified
as to what he thought.

02:12:27.192 --> 02:12:28.402
Sustained.

02:12:28.569 --> 02:12:32.823
Did your husband strike you that night?
Did he hit you that night?

02:12:38.036 --> 02:12:41.456
He may have slapped me
because I was hysterical.

02:12:41.540 --> 02:12:44.126
Didn't you swear to a lie
to stop him hitting you?

02:12:44.209 --> 02:12:45.252
No. I didn't.

02:12:45.544 --> 02:12:48.380
Didn't he beat you at the gate
upon your return from...

02:12:48.463 --> 02:12:49.631
...lovers' lane with Quill?

02:12:50.132 --> 02:12:53.802
Objection. She testified
she was beaten by Barney Quill.

02:12:53.927 --> 02:12:57.097
- Quiet.
- No more questions.

02:12:58.765 --> 02:13:01.310
I think the witness has had enough,
Your Honour.

02:13:01.393 --> 02:13:02.978
The witness may step down.

02:13:03.103 --> 02:13:05.606
We'll recess for lunch.

02:13:06.607 --> 02:13:08.442
Recess until 1:00.

02:13:11.862 --> 02:13:13.238
It's all right, you were fine.

02:13:46.938 --> 02:13:48.482
Dr. Smith?

02:13:49.191 --> 02:13:50.650
I've come to meet you, sir.

02:13:50.734 --> 02:13:51.860
My name is...

02:13:51.943 --> 02:13:53.278
Sorry, you're mistaken.

02:13:53.361 --> 02:13:56.698
Maybe I'm the one you're looking for.
Are you Mr. Biegler?

02:13:56.781 --> 02:13:59.326
No, I'm his associate in the case.

02:13:59.409 --> 02:14:00.869
Don't tell me you're Dr. Smith?

02:14:00.952 --> 02:14:02.370
That's me.

02:14:02.496 --> 02:14:04.206
The Army psychiatrist?

02:14:04.581 --> 02:14:06.666
Maybe you expected me to be in uniform.

02:14:07.083 --> 02:14:08.168
No.

02:14:09.211 --> 02:14:11.463
I didn't expect anybody so young.

02:14:12.005 --> 02:14:13.381
I'm forty.

02:14:14.758 --> 02:14:18.345
I sort of hoped you'd have a beard
and wear a monocle.

02:14:21.431 --> 02:14:23.975
- Is that better?
- It helps.

02:14:24.059 --> 02:14:26.645
You're on the stand this afternoon.

02:14:28.939 --> 02:14:31.733
Have you formed an opinion
as to Frederick Manion's...

02:14:31.816 --> 02:14:34.611
...mental and emotional state
when he killed Barney Quill?

02:14:34.736 --> 02:14:36.446
- I have.
- And what is it?

02:14:36.529 --> 02:14:39.532
He was temporarily insane
at the time of the shooting.

02:14:39.658 --> 02:14:43.995
At that time, do you believe he was able
to distinguish right from wrong?

02:14:44.162 --> 02:14:47.457
He may or may not have been.
It doesn't make much difference.

02:14:47.832 --> 02:14:50.168
As clearly as you can...

02:14:50.377 --> 02:14:53.963
...will you explain
Manion's temporary insanity?

02:14:54.047 --> 02:14:56.758
It is known as "dissociative reaction."

02:14:57.300 --> 02:15:02.055
A psychic shock which creates
an almost overwhelming tension...

02:15:02.138 --> 02:15:04.933
...which the person in shock must alleviate.

02:15:05.141 --> 02:15:07.769
In Lt. Manion's case, a soldier...

02:15:07.852 --> 02:15:10.647
...it is only natural
that he would turn to action.

02:15:10.730 --> 02:15:14.442
Only direct, simple action
against Barney Quill...

02:15:14.526 --> 02:15:16.569
...would relieve this unbearable tension.

02:15:17.028 --> 02:15:18.321
This is not uncommon.

02:15:18.404 --> 02:15:21.741
For example, in combat,
some of the more remarkable heroics...

02:15:21.825 --> 02:15:23.660
...take place in this state of mind.

02:15:23.743 --> 02:15:27.705
Is there another name for this state
we might be more likely to recognise?

02:15:27.789 --> 02:15:30.959
Yes, it has been known
as "irresistible impulse."

02:15:31.751 --> 02:15:35.713
A man in the grip of irresistible impulse,
would he be likely to go...

02:15:35.797 --> 02:15:39.759
...to his neighbour for advice,
or call up the police to come to his aid?

02:15:39.926 --> 02:15:41.261
Completely incompatible.

02:15:41.427 --> 02:15:45.890
Yes, but our man was able
to take out a gun and load it...

02:15:45.974 --> 02:15:47.767
...before setting out to find Quill.

02:15:47.850 --> 02:15:49.686
That was his conscious mind.

02:15:49.769 --> 02:15:52.438
But if no gun were available,
he would've gone anyway.

02:15:52.522 --> 02:15:56.275
How would a man look
in the grip of dissociative reaction?

02:15:56.359 --> 02:16:00.405
He might appear to be deadly calm,
fiercely deliberate.

02:16:01.280 --> 02:16:05.868
Would you describe his behaviour as being
like a mailman delivering the mail?

02:16:05.952 --> 02:16:10.707
Yes. Like a mailman, he would have
a job to do and he would do it.

02:16:11.833 --> 02:16:13.167
Your witness.

02:16:14.377 --> 02:16:16.921
Did you find any psychosis
in Frederick Manion?

02:16:17.004 --> 02:16:18.881
- I did not.
- Any neurosis?

02:16:18.965 --> 02:16:21.134
I found no history of neurosis.

02:16:21.259 --> 02:16:24.804
- Any history of delusion?
- None.

02:16:24.887 --> 02:16:27.640
- Loss of memory?
- Not before this instance.

02:16:29.142 --> 02:16:30.768
Can you spot Mary Pilant?

02:16:31.853 --> 02:16:35.731
She didn't come back after lunch.
I think you'd better give up on that one.

02:16:36.566 --> 02:16:39.568
Doctor, you stated that the defendant
might or might not...

02:16:39.693 --> 02:16:42.362
...have been able to distinguish
right from wrong...

02:16:42.446 --> 02:16:44.615
...but it wouldn't have made a difference.

02:16:44.699 --> 02:16:46.534
- Is that what you said?
- Approximately.

02:16:46.617 --> 02:16:50.538
So, at the time of the shooting,
he could have known the difference?

02:16:50.620 --> 02:16:52.456
He might have, yes.

02:16:52.540 --> 02:16:54.000
Dr. Smith...

02:16:54.250 --> 02:16:59.213
...if the defendant could have known
what he was doing and that it was wrong...

02:16:59.297 --> 02:17:02.133
...how can you testify
that he was legally insane?

02:17:02.216 --> 02:17:04.635
I'm not saying he was legally insane.

02:17:04.718 --> 02:17:08.222
I'm saying that in his condition
it wouldn't have made a difference...

02:17:08.306 --> 02:17:12.058
...whether he knew right from wrong.
He would still have shot Quill.

02:17:12.309 --> 02:17:14.227
Dr. Smith...

02:17:14.312 --> 02:17:18.357
...are you willing to rest your testimony
in this case on this opinion?

02:17:18.441 --> 02:17:19.816
Yes, I am.

02:17:21.527 --> 02:17:24.362
Your Honour,
I'd like to ask for a short recess.

02:17:24.447 --> 02:17:27.782
We would like to meet with Mr. Biegler
and the court in chambers.

02:17:27.867 --> 02:17:30.494
- Mr. Biegler?
- Glad to oblige, Your Honour.

02:17:31.120 --> 02:17:33.914
Short recess. The jury will remain.

02:17:45.550 --> 02:17:51.223
Someday I'm going to horrify tradition
and lay a dense cloud of tobacco smoke...

02:17:51.307 --> 02:17:53.392
...in that hallowed courtroom.

02:17:53.642 --> 02:17:56.061
What's on your mind, Mr. Dancer?

02:17:56.187 --> 02:18:00.232
In view of Dr. Smith's testimony,
the defence might like to change their plea.

02:18:00.316 --> 02:18:03.235
- Change it to what?
- Guilty, of course.

02:18:03.318 --> 02:18:04.904
No, we'll still go for broke.

02:18:05.612 --> 02:18:09.909
No one's considered nuts
unless he didn't know right from wrong.

02:18:09.992 --> 02:18:14.495
- Why don't you get this over with?
- Your Honour, would you turn to page 486?

02:18:14.788 --> 02:18:16.040
What's that?

02:18:16.582 --> 02:18:18.876
Appears to be a law book, Mr. Lodwick.

02:18:20.753 --> 02:18:22.838
I'm sorry, Your Honour.

02:18:22.922 --> 02:18:25.215
I make those to help me think sometimes.

02:18:25.382 --> 02:18:28.052
- For perch?
- No, it's for frogs.

02:18:28.135 --> 02:18:29.969
What case is he citing?

02:18:30.304 --> 02:18:32.764
We gig frogs
down in my part of the country.

02:18:32.848 --> 02:18:33.932
It's the same up here.

02:18:34.016 --> 02:18:37.061
I'm a trout man,
but this is a new wrinkle I'm gonna try.

02:18:37.144 --> 02:18:38.978
They do it a lot down in the bayou.

02:18:39.063 --> 02:18:42.816
The idea is to get a great big long pole
and a 10-pound line.

02:18:42.900 --> 02:18:45.611
Just drift along a high bank in a boat.

02:18:46.486 --> 02:18:51.200
Then you see that great big old bullfrog
in a crevice, and you float this along...

02:18:51.325 --> 02:18:54.827
...in front of him
and that old tongue snaps out.

02:18:54.912 --> 02:18:56.538
You got frog's legs for supper.

02:18:56.621 --> 02:18:57.956
I'll be darned.

02:18:58.040 --> 02:18:59.625
Keep it. Try it sometime.

02:18:59.708 --> 02:19:01.459
Thanks. I will.

02:19:02.002 --> 02:19:03.796
486.

02:19:05.047 --> 02:19:09.218
- What is it, Your Honour?
- People versus Durfee, 1886.

02:19:10.135 --> 02:19:12.137
Looks like a precedent.

02:19:12.346 --> 02:19:14.473
Would you like to read it, Mr. Dancer?

02:19:15.432 --> 02:19:19.520
No, thank you. I think I recall the case.

02:19:20.145 --> 02:19:24.358
We're hooked, like the frog.

02:19:27.818 --> 02:19:30.739
Dr. Harcourt, where did you receive
your university training?

02:19:30.822 --> 02:19:32.741
Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, Maryland.

02:19:32.824 --> 02:19:34.868
And where do you practise now?

02:19:34.951 --> 02:19:38.871
I'm the medical superintendent
of the Bonder State Hospital for the insane.

02:19:38.956 --> 02:19:43.834
It's been stated that dissociative reaction
or irresistible impulse...

02:19:44.002 --> 02:19:46.838
...is not uncommon
among soldiers in combat.

02:19:46.922 --> 02:19:49.675
- Do you agree with that statement?
- I do.

02:19:49.758 --> 02:19:51.677
But not as it was put by Dr. Smith.

02:19:51.760 --> 02:19:53.512
Where would you depart from Dr. Smith?

02:19:53.595 --> 02:19:57.516
Dissociative reaction is not something
that comes out of the blue...

02:19:57.599 --> 02:19:59.601
...and disappears as quickly.

02:19:59.685 --> 02:20:03.855
It can only occur,
even among soldiers in combat...

02:20:03.980 --> 02:20:07.734
...if the individual has a psychoneurotic
condition of long standing.

02:20:08.110 --> 02:20:11.196
It has been testified here
that a psychiatric examination...

02:20:11.279 --> 02:20:14.282
...of the defendant showed
no evidence of neurosis...

02:20:14.366 --> 02:20:16.743
...and no history of dissociative reaction.

02:20:16.827 --> 02:20:20.038
You've also heard it testified
that the defendant's behaviour...

02:20:20.122 --> 02:20:23.375
...on the night of the shooting
was cool and direct.

02:20:23.625 --> 02:20:27.003
- As an observer, do you remember this?
- Yes.

02:20:27.504 --> 02:20:30.382
Have you formed an opinion
about the defendant's sanity...

02:20:30.465 --> 02:20:32.050
...on the night of the shooting?

02:20:32.175 --> 02:20:33.635
Yes. I'm of the opinion...

02:20:33.718 --> 02:20:36.721
...that he was in sufficient possession
of his faculties...

02:20:36.805 --> 02:20:39.474
...so he was not dominated
by his unconscious mind.

02:20:39.558 --> 02:20:43.186
In other words, he was not in the grip
of irresistible impulse.

02:20:43.395 --> 02:20:44.896
In my opinion, he was not.

02:20:44.980 --> 02:20:46.147
Your witness.

02:20:46.314 --> 02:20:51.528
Psychiatry is an effort to probe into
the dark, undiscovered world of the mind.

02:20:51.778 --> 02:20:55.156
In there, the world might be round,
it could be square.

02:20:55.365 --> 02:20:59.244
Your opinion could be wrong, Dr. Smith's
opinion could be right, is that true?

02:20:59.327 --> 02:21:01.746
I'd be a poor doctor
if I didn't agree with that.

02:21:01.913 --> 02:21:04.708
But, I believe my opinion to be right.

02:21:05.375 --> 02:21:07.794
Might you have changed your opinion...

02:21:07.877 --> 02:21:10.338
...if you'd examined the defendant
like Dr. Smith?

02:21:11.423 --> 02:21:12.590
I don't believe so.

02:21:12.882 --> 02:21:15.802
But Smith's opinion was made
under better circumstances?

02:21:16.177 --> 02:21:18.888
If you mean that he was able
to examine the man, yes.

02:21:19.097 --> 02:21:20.890
Yes. Thank you, Doctor.

02:21:20.974 --> 02:21:24.102
That's all, Dr. Harcourt.
Is there more rebuttal?

02:21:24.436 --> 02:21:26.396
We're over a barrel, Mitch.

02:21:26.771 --> 02:21:28.690
We have to use him.

02:21:29.524 --> 02:21:31.735
We call Duane Miller to the stand.

02:21:32.110 --> 02:21:34.112
Will the sheriff bring in the witness?

02:21:40.618 --> 02:21:41.995
What can he tell?

02:21:43.204 --> 02:21:44.497
Nothing.

02:21:45.707 --> 02:21:47.459
He can't tell anything.

02:21:58.595 --> 02:21:59.846
Raise your right hand.

02:21:59.929 --> 02:22:01.931
Do you swear the testimony you give...

02:22:02.015 --> 02:22:05.185
...shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

02:22:05.268 --> 02:22:06.311
I do.

02:22:09.022 --> 02:22:10.523
State your name, please.

02:22:10.607 --> 02:22:13.192
Duane Miller. Most folks call me Duke.

02:22:13.276 --> 02:22:15.069
Where do you presently reside?

02:22:15.445 --> 02:22:17.488
Across the alley, in the jail.

02:22:17.572 --> 02:22:19.490
You know the defendant, Lt. Manion?

02:22:19.866 --> 02:22:22.744
I got to know him recently.
His cell's next to mine.

02:22:22.869 --> 02:22:25.163
When was your last conversation?

02:22:25.747 --> 02:22:28.916
Except for "hello" this morning,
it was last night.

02:22:29.167 --> 02:22:31.461
Did you discuss his trial last night?

02:22:31.544 --> 02:22:32.670
Yeah, some.

02:22:32.754 --> 02:22:35.923
Would you tell the court
what Lt. Manion said about the trial?

02:22:36.007 --> 02:22:38.926
I said, "Are things looking up, Lieutenant?"

02:22:39.761 --> 02:22:42.472
He said, "I got it made, buster."

02:22:42.722 --> 02:22:46.893
He said, "I fooled my lawyer,
I fooled that head-shrinker...

02:22:47.101 --> 02:22:49.604
"... l'm gonna fool
those corn-cobbers on the jury."

02:22:49.812 --> 02:22:50.980
You're a liar!

02:22:51.064 --> 02:22:53.441
A lousy stinking liar!

02:22:57.570 --> 02:23:00.031
I apologise for my client, Your Honour.

02:23:00.531 --> 02:23:04.076
His outburst is almost excusable
since the prosecution has seen fit...

02:23:04.160 --> 02:23:08.206
...to put a felon on the stand to testify
against an officer in the U.S. Army.

02:23:08.331 --> 02:23:12.043
I don't know who is the worst offender:
Manion or his lawyer.

02:23:12.502 --> 02:23:14.504
We're close to the end.

02:23:14.754 --> 02:23:19.842
In the name of heaven, let's have peace
and courtesy for these last few hours.

02:23:20.468 --> 02:23:24.639
Mr. Dancer, you will continue
your interrogation without comment.

02:23:25.431 --> 02:23:28.726
Mr. Biegler, you will not sound off
at every opportunity.

02:23:28.851 --> 02:23:31.687
The defendant will remain seated
and keep his mouth shut.

02:23:31.771 --> 02:23:34.065
- Now, go ahead.
- Mr. Miller.

02:23:34.440 --> 02:23:36.984
Are you certain that Lt. Manion said:

02:23:37.276 --> 02:23:40.363
- "I've got it made, buster"?
- That's what he said.

02:23:40.446 --> 02:23:43.199
- Did Lt. Manion say anything else?
- Yes, sir.

02:23:43.658 --> 02:23:46.285
He said when he got out,
the first thing he'd do...

02:23:46.369 --> 02:23:49.121
...was kick that bitch
from here to kingdom come.

02:23:50.414 --> 02:23:53.125
- To whom was he referring?
- To his wife.

02:23:54.293 --> 02:23:55.753
Your witness, Mr. Biegler.

02:23:56.879 --> 02:23:59.173
- What're you in jail for, Mr. Miller?
- Arson.

02:23:59.256 --> 02:24:01.258
I copped out
and I'm waiting for a sentence.

02:24:01.342 --> 02:24:03.344
How many other crimes
have you committed?

02:24:03.636 --> 02:24:06.639
I was in reform school when I was a kid,
but that's all.

02:24:07.390 --> 02:24:09.850
I'd like to see this man's criminal record.

02:24:10.101 --> 02:24:12.019
Do you have his record?

02:24:12.228 --> 02:24:13.270
Yes, sir.

02:24:14.480 --> 02:24:15.773
Here it is.

02:24:19.110 --> 02:24:23.739
Your record shows you've been in prison
six times in three different states.

02:24:24.573 --> 02:24:29.745
Been in three times for arson,
twice for assault, once for larceny.

02:24:32.206 --> 02:24:35.292
It also shows you've done
short stretches in four city jails...

02:24:35.376 --> 02:24:39.129
...on charges of indecent exposure,
window-peeping...

02:24:39.213 --> 02:24:41.799
...perjury and disorderly conduct.

02:24:43.133 --> 02:24:44.885
Is this your true record?

02:24:46.053 --> 02:24:47.596
Them things are never right.

02:24:47.805 --> 02:24:50.182
How did you get the ear
of the prosecution...

02:24:50.307 --> 02:24:53.769
...to tell them about this conversation
you had with Lt. Manion?

02:24:53.852 --> 02:24:56.522
- The D.A. Was taking us to his office.
- Taking who?

02:24:56.772 --> 02:24:58.232
Us prisoners, in the jail.

02:24:58.357 --> 02:25:00.067
All at once, or one at a time?

02:25:00.234 --> 02:25:01.527
One at a time.

02:25:01.819 --> 02:25:04.822
Him and that other lawyer
took us to his office...

02:25:04.905 --> 02:25:07.157
...and asked us questions about Lt. Manion.

02:25:07.366 --> 02:25:10.995
Were you promised a lighter sentence
if you went on the witness stand?

02:25:11.078 --> 02:25:13.580
- The People object...
- Overruled. Answer.

02:25:13.706 --> 02:25:15.290
I wasn't promised anything.

02:25:15.374 --> 02:25:17.209
You just thought it would help you...

02:25:17.292 --> 02:25:19.753
...if you dreamed up this story
to please the D.A.

02:25:19.878 --> 02:25:21.171
I didn't dream it up.

02:25:21.255 --> 02:25:23.507
- You're sure that's what he said?
- I'm sure.

02:25:23.632 --> 02:25:25.926
As sure as you were about your record?

02:25:26.552 --> 02:25:28.721
I guess I kind of goofed on that one.

02:25:31.014 --> 02:25:36.145
I don't feel I can dignify this creature
with any more questions.

02:25:36.520 --> 02:25:37.938
Take the witness away.

02:25:39.022 --> 02:25:40.899
Would you like a conference
with your client?

02:25:40.983 --> 02:25:43.902
I can see how the last witness
was quite a surprise.

02:25:44.361 --> 02:25:46.530
No, we don't need a conference.

02:25:46.738 --> 02:25:49.283
I'll recall Lt. Manion to the stand right now.

02:25:57.624 --> 02:26:00.586
You've heard the testimony of this Miller.

02:26:01.837 --> 02:26:03.380
Is any part of it true?

02:26:03.547 --> 02:26:04.715
None.

02:26:05.591 --> 02:26:09.803
Do you have any idea why he might come
here with a tale like that?

02:26:10.012 --> 02:26:11.054
No, sir.

02:26:13.348 --> 02:26:15.475
Have you ever talked with this man?

02:26:15.726 --> 02:26:16.768
Yes.

02:26:17.769 --> 02:26:19.313
What did you talk about?

02:26:21.398 --> 02:26:23.150
Nothing important.

02:26:23.650 --> 02:26:27.112
Certainly nothing about my personal life
or my feelings.

02:26:28.030 --> 02:26:29.781
That's all I wanted to know.

02:26:29.865 --> 02:26:31.533
Lt. Manion.

02:26:32.284 --> 02:26:37.164
Have you ever had any trouble with Miller?

02:26:38.874 --> 02:26:41.460
What do you mean?
An argument, something like that?

02:26:41.752 --> 02:26:45.547
Did you ever attack Miller?
Physically attack him?

02:26:46.798 --> 02:26:49.342
Your lawyer can't answer the question
for you.

02:26:49.468 --> 02:26:51.344
Did you ever attack Miller?

02:26:51.428 --> 02:26:53.847
I wouldn't call it an attack, exactly.

02:26:54.055 --> 02:26:56.183
I pushed his head against the bars once.

02:26:56.266 --> 02:26:59.269
- Why?
- He said something ugly about my wife.

02:26:59.728 --> 02:27:03.023
Do you remember pushing or bumping
his head against the bars?

02:27:03.315 --> 02:27:05.275
Sure. I just told you.

02:27:05.442 --> 02:27:07.652
Then this was not dissociative reaction?

02:27:07.736 --> 02:27:10.614
- The defendant isn't qualified to answer.
- Sustained.

02:27:10.697 --> 02:27:12.365
Lt. Manion.

02:27:12.824 --> 02:27:16.870
Wasn't your action against Quill
the same as your action against Miller...

02:27:16.953 --> 02:27:20.081
...and against the lieutenant
you struck at the cocktail party?

02:27:20.207 --> 02:27:24.294
All in the heat of anger, with a wilful,
conscious desire to hurt or kill?

02:27:24.878 --> 02:27:27.088
I don't remember my action against Quill.

02:27:28.340 --> 02:27:31.676
How long had you known
your wife was running around with Quill?

02:27:33.261 --> 02:27:35.347
I never knew anything like that.

02:27:36.514 --> 02:27:37.724
I trust my wife.

02:27:38.975 --> 02:27:41.728
I suppose you beat her up occasionally
just for fun?

02:27:41.811 --> 02:27:44.773
Nothing has been established
to permit such a question.

02:27:45.190 --> 02:27:47.400
He implies things
without getting to the point.

02:27:47.525 --> 02:27:50.945
Let him ask, "Did he ever beat his wife?"

02:27:51.029 --> 02:27:52.697
I'll sustain the objection.

02:27:52.906 --> 02:27:55.450
Would you like to rephrase your question?

02:27:57.035 --> 02:27:58.578
No, thank you.

02:27:59.454 --> 02:28:00.997
I've finished.

02:28:01.289 --> 02:28:02.999
Then I'll ask it.

02:28:03.124 --> 02:28:06.586
Did you ever beat your wife,
on the night of the shooting...

02:28:06.711 --> 02:28:08.338
...or at any other time?
- No.

02:28:08.421 --> 02:28:12.258
Is there any doubt in your mind
that Quill raped Mrs. Manion?

02:28:12.342 --> 02:28:13.843
- No, sir.
- That's all.

02:28:13.968 --> 02:28:15.303
Step down, Lieutenant.

02:28:21.810 --> 02:28:24.270
- Are we hurt?
- We're hurt bad.

02:28:24.646 --> 02:28:25.688
Paul.

02:28:30.443 --> 02:28:34.197
I know time is pressing,
I don't want to ask for a recess.

02:28:34.322 --> 02:28:36.199
I'd like to leave the courtroom briefly.

02:28:36.324 --> 02:28:38.868
If it's important,
we can be at ease for a minute.

02:28:39.202 --> 02:28:40.870
Thank you, sir.

02:28:41.663 --> 02:28:43.790
This is highly irregular, Your Honour.

02:28:44.082 --> 02:28:46.960
There's no reason
to make a federal case out of it.

02:28:58.388 --> 02:28:59.764
Thank you, Your Honour.

02:28:59.889 --> 02:29:02.058
We now have another rebuttal witness.

02:29:02.141 --> 02:29:04.060
The defence calls Mary Pilant.

02:29:04.143 --> 02:29:06.354
We must protest this whole affair.

02:29:06.479 --> 02:29:09.524
The noble defence attorney
rushes to a secret conference...

02:29:09.607 --> 02:29:12.568
...and the last-minute witness
is brought dramatically in.

02:29:12.694 --> 02:29:15.863
It's obviously been rigged
to unduly excite the jury.

02:29:15.947 --> 02:29:18.116
It's just another cornball trick.

02:29:18.241 --> 02:29:21.536
Your Honour, I don't blame Mr. Dancer
for feeling put upon.

02:29:21.619 --> 02:29:24.539
I'm just a humble country lawyer,
trying to do my best...

02:29:24.622 --> 02:29:28.084
...against this brilliant prosecutor
from the big city of Lansing.

02:29:28.334 --> 02:29:30.086
Swear the witness.

02:29:31.003 --> 02:29:32.338
Raise your right hand.

02:29:32.422 --> 02:29:34.465
Do you swear the testimony you give...

02:29:34.549 --> 02:29:38.386
...shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

02:29:38.553 --> 02:29:40.346
- I do.
- Sit down, please.

02:29:43.724 --> 02:29:46.769
- Where do you live?
- At the Thunder Bay Inn, in Thunder Bay.

02:29:46.853 --> 02:29:49.647
- How long have you lived there?
- For two years.

02:29:50.273 --> 02:29:52.942
- What's your profession?
- I manage the inn.

02:29:53.484 --> 02:29:54.902
Miss Pilant.

02:29:55.027 --> 02:29:57.655
How is the laundry handled at the inn?

02:29:57.864 --> 02:29:59.866
It's chuted down to the laundry room.

02:29:59.949 --> 02:30:02.618
Where is that chute on the second floor?

02:30:02.743 --> 02:30:04.787
Between Room 42 and 43.

02:30:04.954 --> 02:30:06.330
Who lives in those rooms?

02:30:06.414 --> 02:30:09.875
I live in 42, Mr. Quill lived in 43.

02:30:10.126 --> 02:30:12.753
Would Mr. Quill,
coming up from the lobby...

02:30:12.837 --> 02:30:16.299
...have to pass by that chute
on the way to his room?

02:30:16.882 --> 02:30:18.676
- Yes.
- Would it be easy for him...

02:30:18.759 --> 02:30:21.262
...to drop something
into that chute as he passed?

02:30:21.345 --> 02:30:22.430
Yes.

02:30:22.513 --> 02:30:25.933
Have you ever had occasion
to go down into the laundry?

02:30:26.058 --> 02:30:29.603
Yes. Part of my job is to sort
various pieces of laundry...

02:30:29.729 --> 02:30:32.189
...as they come out of the machines.

02:30:32.273 --> 02:30:35.192
Would you tell us
what you found among the laundry...

02:30:35.317 --> 02:30:37.528
...the day after Mr. Quill was killed?

02:30:37.778 --> 02:30:39.947
I found a pair of woman's panties.

02:30:40.156 --> 02:30:43.075
- What did you do with them?
- I threw them in the rag bin.

02:30:43.200 --> 02:30:46.245
When did you learn the significance
of those panties?

02:30:46.829 --> 02:30:49.457
Here. This morning in the courtroom.

02:30:49.623 --> 02:30:52.209
- You went and got them out of the rag bin?
- Yes.

02:30:52.293 --> 02:30:54.545
- Did you bring them with you?
- Yes.

02:30:57.465 --> 02:31:03.220
I offer this article of lingerie
as "Exhibit Number 1" for the defence.

02:31:03.345 --> 02:31:04.680
They're white.

02:31:05.014 --> 02:31:07.141
They have lace up the side...

02:31:07.933 --> 02:31:09.727
...and they're badly torn.

02:31:10.019 --> 02:31:13.314
As if they'd been ripped apart
by powerful hands.

02:31:13.939 --> 02:31:15.900
The label reads:

02:31:17.276 --> 02:31:19.737
"Smartshop, Phoenix, Arizona."

02:31:20.196 --> 02:31:23.490
If there is no objection,
the exhibit will be received in evidence.

02:31:23.616 --> 02:31:24.658
That's all.

02:31:24.742 --> 02:31:27.786
Did you ever talk to Mr. Lodwick
about Quill's death?

02:31:28.078 --> 02:31:31.457
Yes. He came to the hotel several times
after Mr. Quill was killed.

02:31:31.665 --> 02:31:34.960
Did you tell him you didn't believe
Quill raped Mrs. Manion?

02:31:35.044 --> 02:31:36.086
Yes, I told him that.

02:31:36.170 --> 02:31:39.965
- Did you ever talk to Mr. Biegler?
- Yes.

02:31:40.049 --> 02:31:42.468
- In connection with Quill's death?
- Yes.

02:31:42.593 --> 02:31:45.304
Did you tell him
you didn't believe Quill raped her?

02:31:45.387 --> 02:31:47.640
- How many times did you talk with him?
- Twice.

02:31:47.723 --> 02:31:49.808
- When was the last time?
- Last night.

02:31:49.892 --> 02:31:51.518
Have you now changed your mind?

02:31:51.644 --> 02:31:53.896
Do you now believe
Quill raped Mrs. Manion?

02:31:54.355 --> 02:31:56.648
I don't know now. I think he might have.

02:31:56.732 --> 02:31:58.942
When did you change your mind,
last night?

02:31:59.068 --> 02:32:00.903
No, it was here, this morning.

02:32:00.986 --> 02:32:03.364
When were you given the panties?
Last night?

02:32:03.489 --> 02:32:06.867
- Just wait a minute!
- Use the proper form of objection.

02:32:07.367 --> 02:32:11.080
On second thought, I don't object.
I'd like the jury to hear her answer.

02:32:11.371 --> 02:32:12.748
The witness may answer.

02:32:12.831 --> 02:32:16.877
No. I was not given the panties,
last night or any other time.

02:32:16.960 --> 02:32:18.712
I found them exactly as I said.

02:32:18.796 --> 02:32:21.632
Do you know that Quill
put the panties in the chute...

02:32:21.757 --> 02:32:23.675
...or did you assume it?
- I assumed it.

02:32:23.759 --> 02:32:26.261
Had you thought someone else
may have put them there?

02:32:26.345 --> 02:32:28.472
Someone who wanted them found
in the laundry?

02:32:28.555 --> 02:32:30.307
I hadn't thought of that.

02:32:30.474 --> 02:32:34.144
In the grip of what Mr. Biegler
might call "irresistible impulse"...

02:32:34.436 --> 02:32:36.230
...you rushed in with the panties...

02:32:36.313 --> 02:32:40.526
...wanting to crucify Quill's character?
- No, it was my duty.

02:32:40.651 --> 02:32:43.487
- Your pride was hurt, right?
- I don't know what you mean.

02:32:43.570 --> 02:32:47.658
He's trying to confuse the witness.
Let him ask a question she understands.

02:32:47.908 --> 02:32:51.787
Yes, Mr. Dancer. I, myself,
would like to know what you're driving at.

02:32:51.995 --> 02:32:54.998
When you found the panties...

02:32:55.374 --> 02:32:58.877
...was your first thought that Quill
might have raped Mrs. Manion...

02:32:58.961 --> 02:33:02.339
...or was it that he might have been
stepping out with Mrs. Manion?

02:33:02.839 --> 02:33:04.675
I don't know what he means.

02:33:04.758 --> 02:33:06.927
Mr. Dancer, once again, I must ask you...

02:33:07.010 --> 02:33:09.513
...to put straight questions to the witness.

02:33:09.805 --> 02:33:12.349
Here is a straight question, Your Honour.

02:33:13.350 --> 02:33:15.727
Miss Pilant,
were you Barney Quill's mistress?

02:33:15.811 --> 02:33:17.646
No, I was not!

02:33:17.729 --> 02:33:19.731
Everyone knows you were living with Quill.

02:33:19.815 --> 02:33:21.900
That's not true. Barney Quill was...

02:33:21.983 --> 02:33:23.527
Was what?

02:33:24.444 --> 02:33:26.822
Barney Quill was what, Miss Pilant?

02:33:28.698 --> 02:33:30.867
Barney Quill was my father.

02:33:42.796 --> 02:33:44.214
No more questions.

02:33:44.923 --> 02:33:46.424
That's all.

02:33:47.843 --> 02:33:49.803
The witness may step down.

02:33:50.178 --> 02:33:54.766
We will recess for 15 minutes, after which
we will hear the closing arguments.

02:33:55.392 --> 02:33:59.396
If possible, I would like to charge the jury
before nightfall.

02:34:15.120 --> 02:34:17.622
Think they're gonna stay out all night?

02:34:32.554 --> 02:34:34.556
Can't somebody say something?

02:34:37.100 --> 02:34:39.352
What do you want me to say,
Maida, darling?

02:34:39.644 --> 02:34:41.354
Tell me we're gonna win.

02:34:42.897 --> 02:34:46.609
I'm counting on getting that
promissory note from the lieutenant.

02:34:46.860 --> 02:34:50.780
I hope we can borrow some money on it.
I need a new typewriter.

02:34:51.322 --> 02:34:54.784
Half the time, the "P" and the "F"
don't strike on mine.

02:34:55.535 --> 02:34:59.956
"Party of the first part" sometimes
comes out "arty o the irst art."

02:35:00.832 --> 02:35:03.418
Doesn't make sense. It's embarrassing.

02:35:03.626 --> 02:35:05.503
"Arty o the irst art"?

02:35:06.087 --> 02:35:07.839
I kind of like that.

02:35:08.464 --> 02:35:10.300
It has a ring to it.

02:35:13.178 --> 02:35:16.264
Twelve people go off into a room.

02:35:17.515 --> 02:35:19.267
Twelve different minds.

02:35:19.559 --> 02:35:21.352
Twelve different hearts.

02:35:21.811 --> 02:35:24.063
Twelve different walks of life.

02:35:25.273 --> 02:35:28.776
Twelve sets of eyes,
ears, shapes and sizes.

02:35:29.819 --> 02:35:34.949
These twelve people are asked to judge
another human being...

02:35:35.325 --> 02:35:38.536
...as different from them
as they are from each other.

02:35:39.203 --> 02:35:43.541
In their judgement, they must become
of one mind, unanimous.

02:35:45.585 --> 02:35:49.714
It's one of the miracles of man's
disorganised soul that they can do it.

02:35:50.548 --> 02:35:53.426
In most instances, do it right well.

02:35:54.844 --> 02:35:57.388
God bless juries.

02:35:58.765 --> 02:36:01.726
I don't know what I'd do
if I were on that jury.

02:36:05.229 --> 02:36:07.190
I really don't know.

02:36:08.733 --> 02:36:09.776
Do you?

02:36:14.447 --> 02:36:16.282
I loved that, Pauly.

02:36:16.532 --> 02:36:19.619
I loved that "humble country lawyer" bit.

02:36:20.703 --> 02:36:22.872
You had Mr. Dancer dancing.

02:36:24.332 --> 02:36:28.169
I'm afraid he got in the last dance.
That's the best summary I've ever heard.

02:36:28.628 --> 02:36:31.130
I liked yours much better, Pauly.

02:36:36.177 --> 02:36:37.720
Do you have to play that?

02:36:37.845 --> 02:36:41.307
<i>Can't you play Danny Boy
or Sweet Isle of Innisfree?</i>

02:36:55.154 --> 02:36:56.656
Paul Biegler's office.

02:36:57.406 --> 02:36:58.991
Yes, sir. Right away.

02:36:59.575 --> 02:37:00.826
They're ready.

02:37:11.212 --> 02:37:13.005
Hey, sweetie!

02:37:14.465 --> 02:37:16.050
Go on.

02:37:17.259 --> 02:37:19.553
- The jury's coming in.
- Yeah, I heard.

02:37:19.637 --> 02:37:22.390
You can tell my loving husband
I'll be in the car.

02:37:22.598 --> 02:37:25.518
- You're sure he's gonna come out?
- Sure.

02:37:25.601 --> 02:37:26.936
He's lucky.

02:37:27.103 --> 02:37:29.438
Some people have all the luck.

02:37:29.563 --> 02:37:33.400
You can tell him I'm waiting
to get kicked to kingdom come.

02:37:33.943 --> 02:37:35.402
Hey, sweetie.

02:37:36.028 --> 02:37:38.989
I have a souvenir for you.

02:37:39.990 --> 02:37:41.867
You'd better keep that.

02:37:42.076 --> 02:37:44.787
You might need it again sometime.
You never know.

02:37:44.870 --> 02:37:46.497
No, you don't, do you?

02:37:46.956 --> 02:37:48.916
I like you, Pauly.

02:37:56.215 --> 02:37:59.802
I warn all those present
not to interrupt the taking of the verdict.

02:37:59.885 --> 02:38:02.721
I will stop the proceedings
and clear the courtroom...

02:38:02.805 --> 02:38:05.140
...if there is any demonstration.

02:38:13.816 --> 02:38:15.734
Proceed, Mr. Cray.

02:38:15.943 --> 02:38:18.362
Members of the jury, have you a verdict?

02:38:18.612 --> 02:38:22.157
- If so, who will speak for you?
- We have. I'm the foreman.

02:38:22.282 --> 02:38:24.326
The defendant will rise.

02:38:26.870 --> 02:38:27.955
What is your verdict?

02:38:28.038 --> 02:38:31.709
We find the defendant not guilty,
by reason of insanity.

02:38:37.339 --> 02:38:39.675
Did Maida give you that promissory note?

02:38:39.800 --> 02:38:43.220
Right here,
ready to be signed by our happy client.

02:38:43.887 --> 02:38:47.474
I used to think the world looked better
through a glass of whiskey.

02:38:47.558 --> 02:38:48.976
It doesn't.

02:38:49.852 --> 02:38:51.478
I think I'll keep it this way.

02:38:51.562 --> 02:38:53.105
It looks nice.

02:38:53.856 --> 02:38:56.358
I got one good thing out of this case:

02:38:57.568 --> 02:38:58.861
A new law partner.

02:38:58.944 --> 02:39:01.113
If it's all right with him.

02:39:01.488 --> 02:39:05.075
He'd be mighty proud to have his name
on a shingle with yours.

02:39:35.063 --> 02:39:37.983
I guess you're looking for Lt. Manion,
aren't you?

02:39:38.358 --> 02:39:40.319
He gave me this note for you.

02:39:41.820 --> 02:39:43.739
Felt real sorry for Mrs. Manion.

02:39:43.822 --> 02:39:45.407
She was crying.

02:39:45.949 --> 02:39:47.659
Left a mess, didn't they?

02:39:47.743 --> 02:39:49.786
We'd better get busy here.

02:39:49.911 --> 02:39:51.538
"Dear Mr. Biegler:

02:39:51.621 --> 02:39:53.665
"So sorry, but I had to leave suddenly.

02:39:53.749 --> 02:39:56.168
"I was seized by an irresistible impulse.

02:39:56.752 --> 02:39:58.462
"Frederick Manion."

02:39:59.588 --> 02:40:02.466
How in the world
are we gonna face Maida?

02:40:03.717 --> 02:40:04.843
Gin.

02:40:05.427 --> 02:40:07.846
I knew there was something wrong
with that guy.

02:40:07.971 --> 02:40:10.557
I never saw a gin-drinker yet
you could trust.

02:40:11.767 --> 02:40:14.895
Partner, what do you say
we go and see our first client?

02:40:15.061 --> 02:40:16.229
Who might that be?

02:40:16.313 --> 02:40:19.608
Mary Pilant. We're going to administer
Barney Quill's estate.

02:40:19.691 --> 02:40:23.195
Now, that's what I call
poetic justice for everybody.

02:40:24.863 --> 02:40:25.906
Yeah.
