00:02.035 --> 00:04.036
- (narrator): <i>Previously on</i>
<i>the strain...</i>

00:04.038 --> 00:08.073
- (creem): What the hell?
What is it, man?

00:08.975 --> 00:12.011
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:13.646 --> 00:15.814
- (gus): Where you taking me?
Get your hands off me!

00:15.816 --> 00:17.883
(tires screeching)

00:17.885 --> 00:19.885
- He's nesting somewhere
in the city.

00:19.887 --> 00:21.887
We can find him
if we work together.

00:21.889 --> 00:24.823
- Have you come here
to destroy me?

00:24.825 --> 00:28.560
(explosions)
(screaming)

00:28.562 --> 00:30.629
- We've got him on the run.
We must press on!

00:30.631 --> 00:32.531
(growling)

00:32.533 --> 00:37.970
- Thank you!
(cackling)

00:45.912 --> 00:49.214
(car doors closing)

01:06.599 --> 01:11.470
- Sir?
- Come along, mr. Fitzwilliam.

01:39.199 --> 01:41.266
I want all this boxed up

01:41.268 --> 01:45.370
And brought back to my office.
- Right away, sir.

01:50.743 --> 01:54.012
- That can stay.

02:08.261 --> 02:12.297
Take special care
of this valuable item.

02:12.299 --> 02:14.900
- Certainly, sir.

02:25.345 --> 02:28.347
- Silver. How quaint!

02:32.185 --> 02:36.255
- Eldritch. Look at you!

02:37.690 --> 02:40.025
How are you feeling?

02:43.329 --> 02:45.797
- I expected it
to be traumatic,

02:45.799 --> 02:49.101
To say the least.
But I feel wonderful!

02:49.103 --> 02:51.970
- Huh!
- Strong, energized,

02:51.972 --> 02:54.206
No pain...

02:54.208 --> 02:56.175
When does my, uh...

02:56.177 --> 02:59.711
- Oh... Did you think
you had been turned?

02:59.713 --> 03:01.947
The master
gave you

03:01.949 --> 03:05.551
The white, yes,
but not the worm.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.886
- He gave me health

03:07.888 --> 03:11.123
But not immortality?

03:12.392 --> 03:15.694
Ugh...

03:15.696 --> 03:20.299
- He visited you
in your hour of need.

03:20.301 --> 03:24.503
He spared you the way
of almost all flesh.

03:24.505 --> 03:27.339
- How long will this last?
- I don't know.

03:27.341 --> 03:30.309
- But not forever.
- Oh, no.

03:30.311 --> 03:34.179
- You're turning people right
and left all across this town,

03:34.181 --> 03:36.882
Yet I'm on some...
Some sort of

03:36.884 --> 03:39.318
Waiting list?

03:39.320 --> 03:41.587
- True, they are being turned,

03:41.589 --> 03:45.891
But being turned
the way you seek, well...

03:45.893 --> 03:48.860
That is a far
different thing.

03:48.862 --> 03:51.730
- I've done too much,
come too far

03:51.732 --> 03:55.934
To be treated this way.
- He chose you, eldritch!

03:55.936 --> 03:59.638
He anointed you.

04:01.174 --> 04:05.344
You will serve at his
right hand for eternity.

04:05.346 --> 04:08.347
Eventually.

04:08.349 --> 04:10.949
- "eventually"? When?

04:10.951 --> 04:13.218
- Think of this
as another test

04:13.220 --> 04:16.688
For your everlasting devotion.

04:22.028 --> 04:24.863
(theme music)

04:41.147 --> 04:43.048
- (kelly): Thanks, buddy.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.050
- Oh, my god,
this is so cool!

04:45.052 --> 04:49.187
Thanks, mom!
- It's from dad, too, okay?

04:51.391 --> 04:54.893
Let's bring it on the street,
let's bring this down...

04:54.895 --> 04:57.162
Oh, and I want to take some
video to send to your dad

04:57.164 --> 04:58.730
While he's at his conference
in atlanta.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.332
- I'll go around the corner
and circle back.

05:00.334 --> 05:02.501
- Perfect. Watch out--
- for a car.

05:02.503 --> 05:06.338
- For cars, you got it.

05:15.782 --> 05:18.583
- Hey, dad, we miss you!

05:18.585 --> 05:21.486
Thanks, mom, I love my bike.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.822
- I love you too, honey.

05:23.824 --> 05:27.326
(gunshots echoing)

05:27.328 --> 05:29.161
(gunshots continue)

05:29.163 --> 05:34.032
(men talking indistinctly)

05:42.175 --> 05:45.510
- (eph): So why did we see
all those vampires in one spot?

05:45.512 --> 05:47.546
- (abraham) safety.
Without the coffin,

05:47.548 --> 05:51.283
The master needs to be protected
during daylight hours.

05:51.285 --> 05:54.152
- So those 500 or 1,000
down there...

05:54.154 --> 05:58.390
- They were his security. The
master will be nesting nearby.

06:00.293 --> 06:03.228
- So, whatever's
aboveground here,

06:03.230 --> 06:06.565
It's important to him. It's
gotta be dark or protected...

06:06.567 --> 06:08.633
- Most likely both.

06:08.635 --> 06:12.037
- Did you just agree with me?

06:12.039 --> 06:14.339
- In this instance, yes.

06:14.341 --> 06:18.543
(scoffs)
- you two are falling in love.

06:18.545 --> 06:22.214
It's a beautiful thing, huh?
My vote:

06:22.216 --> 06:25.217
Reconnaissance.
Now, doc and I, we go down

06:25.219 --> 06:28.153
To vestry and washington
and see what's there, yeah?

06:28.155 --> 06:30.322
And we should move.

06:30.324 --> 06:32.257
We wanna burn as little
daylight as possible.

06:32.259 --> 06:35.394
- Excellent idea.

06:35.396 --> 06:37.429
- I heard you guys talking.
What's going on?

06:37.431 --> 06:39.398
- Uh, we're just
discussing our plans.

06:39.400 --> 06:43.001
- Are you going to try
to attack him again?

06:43.003 --> 06:45.137
- We most certainly are.

06:47.273 --> 06:50.409
- We're just, uh... Fet and I

06:50.411 --> 06:52.711
Are going down to tribeca
to check some things out.

06:52.713 --> 06:55.914
- What about me?
- You? Uh, get dressed!

06:55.916 --> 06:58.083
We'll be back
before you know it.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.285
- When can we go home?

07:02.288 --> 07:04.990
- Zach, we can't go back.

07:19.572 --> 07:21.706
I'd appreciate it
if you let me decide

07:21.708 --> 07:23.809
What I want to tell my own son.

07:23.811 --> 07:27.078
- Sheltering him will ultimately
only make things worse.

07:27.080 --> 07:30.215
He needs to know the truth.
The whole truth.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.717
Including what happened
to his mother.

07:32.719 --> 07:35.253
- That's not your decision
to make. Keep your mouth shut.

07:35.255 --> 07:38.924
- Shortest honeymoon
on record, huh?

07:38.926 --> 07:42.527
Come on, doc.
We're burning daylight.

07:53.272 --> 07:55.941
(metallic clang)

07:55.943 --> 07:58.743
- (gus): Who's there? Huh?

08:00.947 --> 08:05.650
You must be real scared
to have me tied up like this.

08:05.652 --> 08:09.888
You scared to look a mexican
in his eye, you coward? Huh?

08:15.995 --> 08:19.831
That's more like it.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.067
What is this shithole?

08:24.203 --> 08:27.606
What the hell are you?
(growling)

08:31.677 --> 08:33.812
You planning on
eating mexican tonight?

08:33.814 --> 08:36.448
You gonna choke,
I promise you that shit.

08:36.450 --> 08:39.451
- I did not bring you
all the way down here

08:39.453 --> 08:41.486
To drink you.

08:41.488 --> 08:45.357
- Down here where, huh?
- Deep underground.

08:45.359 --> 08:47.225
Somewhere safe.

08:47.227 --> 08:49.561
- Safe from what?
(growling)

08:49.563 --> 08:52.097
What are you gonna
do with that, huh?

08:59.839 --> 09:03.308
- You be patient.

09:07.213 --> 09:10.181
- So what do you
wanna do, huh?

09:10.183 --> 09:13.485
Wanna just talk,
have a conversation?

09:16.022 --> 09:18.390
(groaning)
- bad idea.

09:18.392 --> 09:20.659
- Damn it!
- Come with me.

09:33.439 --> 09:35.840
- This is the heart of one
who has been turned.

09:35.842 --> 09:39.377
I thought it would make
a nicely ironic addition

09:39.379 --> 09:42.514
To my collection
of my own failed organs.

09:42.516 --> 09:46.017
- If you say so, sir.
- Apparently,

09:46.019 --> 09:50.288
Dr. Goodweather made
an unauthorized broadcast

09:50.290 --> 09:52.524
Last night, using
the emergency alert system.

09:52.526 --> 09:56.027
Why was I not
made aware of this?

09:56.029 --> 09:59.264
- You were dying, sir.
It didn't seem important.

09:59.266 --> 10:01.399
- Well, it was important
enough that

10:01.401 --> 10:04.369
The secretary of health and
human services, maggie pierson,

10:04.371 --> 10:07.839
Is talking about quarantining
all of manhattan.

10:09.875 --> 10:12.544
I need to have
a serious chat with her.

10:12.546 --> 10:15.947
Bring the car around.
Contact eichhorst.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.016
- No, sir.

10:22.555 --> 10:25.890
- Excuse me?
- Won't do it.

10:25.892 --> 10:27.626
Not anymore.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.761
When people called you cruel

10:29.763 --> 10:32.731
And selfish, I defended you.

10:32.733 --> 10:36.434
I said they didn't know you
as I know you.

10:36.436 --> 10:38.937
Then eichhorst showed up
and his ilk,

10:38.939 --> 10:40.905
And I told myself it was them,

10:40.907 --> 10:43.808
Manipulating you,
warping your judgment.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.077
I was wrong.

10:46.079 --> 10:49.280
- You've been by my side
the entire time.

10:49.282 --> 10:52.417
- Yes, I am complicit,
because I served you loyally.

10:52.419 --> 10:56.488
- This is the part where the
whore declares herself a virgin.

10:56.490 --> 10:59.658
- You made a devil's bargain.
You pulled me into it with you.

10:59.660 --> 11:01.760
Your sudden resurrection

11:01.762 --> 11:04.295
Is an affront to nature
and to god.

11:04.297 --> 11:07.766
- What a load of horse shit!
You self-righteous

11:07.768 --> 11:11.803
Son of a bitch!
How dare you defy me!

11:11.805 --> 11:14.639
- Part of me thinks
I should kill you right now,

11:14.641 --> 11:18.009
Restore the natural
order of things.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.978
But I can't.

11:19.980 --> 11:24.015
Not after all you did for me.

11:24.017 --> 11:28.386
Consider my debt to you
paid in full.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.355
Never come after me.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.624
- You fool!

11:32.626 --> 11:35.293
Deserting me when we're
on the verge of triumph!

11:35.295 --> 11:38.630
Where will you go?

11:38.632 --> 11:41.433
What will you do
without me to protect you?

11:43.202 --> 11:45.070
- The question is, sir,

11:45.072 --> 11:49.240
What will you do
without me to protect you?

12:09.195 --> 12:11.963
(men arguing indistinctly)

12:14.066 --> 12:17.135
(sirens approaching)

12:22.074 --> 12:24.776
- That goth douche bag.

12:28.247 --> 12:31.015
- Uh, share the wealth, doc?
- Bolivar? The one who

12:31.017 --> 12:32.784
Attacked nora's mother? He was
one of the four survivors

12:32.786 --> 12:36.087
On the plane. He said he was
buying a theater in tribeca.

12:36.089 --> 12:39.724
He's living there.
- He bought the vestry, huh?

12:39.726 --> 12:43.294
Oh, this place goes
all the way back to vaudeville,

12:43.296 --> 12:46.765
You know? And since then, it's
been a silent movie theater,

12:46.767 --> 12:51.269
Yiddish stage, speakeasy,
uh, burlesque house...

12:51.271 --> 12:54.973
This boulevard is one of
the master's favorite vamps.

12:54.975 --> 12:58.543
- Then there's a high
probability the master's inside.

13:00.212 --> 13:02.380
- Probability's not
gonna cut it, doc.

13:02.382 --> 13:05.116
We need to know
for sure, you know?

13:05.118 --> 13:07.719
(fet mumbling to himself)

13:09.455 --> 13:11.656
- What?

13:14.126 --> 13:17.328
- You know how I said that
theater used to be a speakeasy?

13:17.330 --> 13:19.697
- Yeah, and...
- Yeah.

13:32.311 --> 13:36.147
In the '20s, this place
was called hawk's tavern.

13:36.149 --> 13:39.617
It was run by a gambler named
diamond jim o'brien

13:39.619 --> 13:43.488
Who also owned the vestry hall
across the way.

13:43.490 --> 13:46.958
But diamond jim,
he was a legend

13:46.960 --> 13:49.127
During the manhattan
bootleg wars

13:49.129 --> 13:51.796
Because his place had been
raided so many times

13:51.798 --> 13:54.933
But never found any booze.
You know why?

13:54.935 --> 13:57.268
- I don't need to,
you're going to tell me.

13:57.270 --> 13:59.003
- They never found
any booze because

13:59.005 --> 14:01.639
He built a secret tunnel,

14:01.641 --> 14:05.643
A tunnel that he connected
to the sewer tunnel

14:05.645 --> 14:09.047
That connected
to the theater, huh?

14:09.049 --> 14:12.884
That's how they ran
the booze back and forth.

14:16.522 --> 14:21.226
No vampires.
That's a good sign.

14:37.843 --> 14:40.111
(feeling along wall)

14:42.681 --> 14:46.951
He used to have, uh, secret
latches to unlock the door.

14:50.589 --> 14:53.725
(loud clanking)

14:53.727 --> 14:56.594
Not bad.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.997
- Alcoholic's
sixth sense for booze.

14:58.999 --> 15:02.767
- Huh.
(unpacking)

15:02.769 --> 15:06.537
- What are you doing? We're not
going in there without backup.

15:06.539 --> 15:09.741
- I'm your backup.
We got weapons.

15:09.743 --> 15:12.076
- We have 30 bullets between us.
We don't know what's on

15:12.078 --> 15:14.512
The other side of that door.
- It's just recon, doc,

15:14.514 --> 15:16.981
You know? A little
sneak and peek. Come on.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.820
(heavy door opening)

15:36.769 --> 15:39.270
There it is.

15:39.272 --> 15:42.006
The old sewer tunnel.

15:45.477 --> 15:49.213
(door creaking)

15:52.318 --> 15:54.652
Whoa.

15:54.654 --> 15:57.322
Look, smell and listen, huh?

16:00.793 --> 16:03.361
Look over this way.

16:04.797 --> 16:09.300
Look at this! Wow!

16:09.302 --> 16:12.103
To haul liquor up and down

16:12.105 --> 16:14.839
During prohibition.

16:14.841 --> 16:17.141
This is our stop.

16:25.684 --> 16:27.852
Come on up.

16:27.854 --> 16:29.921
Coast is clear.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.523
- Coffin.

17:05.525 --> 17:09.694
They're reassembling it.

17:09.696 --> 17:12.964
- The master must be
around here somewhere.

17:12.966 --> 17:16.901
Huh?
(vampires growling)

17:28.680 --> 17:31.482
- Okay, that's
enough recon.

17:41.193 --> 17:44.662
Let's get the others
while it's still daylight.

17:47.266 --> 17:50.368
What the hell are you doing?

17:50.370 --> 17:53.237
- "the secret to all victory

17:53.239 --> 17:56.941
Lies in the organization of the
non-obvious." marcus aurelius.

17:56.943 --> 17:58.743
We're gonna flood the sewer
tunnels with sunlight.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.379
We don't want any more munchers
to get into the theater

18:01.381 --> 18:03.648
Before we come back.

18:05.117 --> 18:07.518
- Come on.

18:13.759 --> 18:18.129
- Do not pull the plug on me!
Ugh, god!

18:20.799 --> 18:23.768
I am trying to gauge the impact
of our pirate broadcast,

18:23.770 --> 18:25.736
But all the channels are gone.

18:25.738 --> 18:28.473
- Well, I think that's
your answer, right there.

18:40.819 --> 18:43.788
- What...
- We've got work to do.

18:46.592 --> 18:50.895
(singing in a foreign language)

19:20.492 --> 19:22.660
- Tell me you found something.

19:22.662 --> 19:26.030
- The master's at bolivar's
theater in tribeca.

19:26.032 --> 19:28.299
The coffin is there -
at least, pieces of it.

19:28.301 --> 19:30.635
- When do we leave?

19:30.637 --> 19:32.336
- I can't go.

19:32.338 --> 19:35.540
- Because of zach?

19:35.542 --> 19:37.175
- Kelly's gonna find him
sooner or later.

19:37.177 --> 19:40.378
I can't leave him alone again.
- So bring him.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.146
- To bolivar's? Are you crazy?
We didn't go 30 feet

19:42.148 --> 19:45.216
Before we ran into vampires.
- Open your eyes, eph. Where

19:45.218 --> 19:48.519
I grew up, people disappeared
in the middle of the night.

19:48.521 --> 19:52.690
You do not have the luxury
of choice anymore.

19:53.792 --> 19:56.460
All we can do now is fight.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.298
If you want
to protect zach,

20:00.300 --> 20:04.202
Just keep him
by your side. Always.

20:04.204 --> 20:07.038
And we'll see
this thing through.

20:09.541 --> 20:12.143
- (pierson): Every bridge
and turnpike.

20:12.145 --> 20:15.246
Shut down all the airports,
the ferries, tunnels.

20:15.248 --> 20:17.348
Nothing gets through.

20:17.350 --> 20:19.317
- Something always
gets through.

20:19.319 --> 20:22.520
We're gonna need every national
guard unit in the northeast.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.755
(knocking on the door)

20:31.196 --> 20:33.831
- Eldritch!
What are you doing here?

20:33.833 --> 20:37.768
- Preventing you from making
a grave mistake, maggie.

20:40.505 --> 20:44.508
- Where's mr. Fitzwilliam?

20:44.510 --> 20:48.012
- On leave.

20:48.014 --> 20:51.449
This is a colleague of mine,
thomas eichhorst.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.217
Secretary pierson,

20:53.219 --> 20:55.886
Everett barnes, with the cdc.

20:55.888 --> 20:58.422
- A pleasure.

20:58.424 --> 21:01.759
- Eldritch, you look
amazingly well. How did--

21:01.761 --> 21:04.762
- Wonderful new medicine.
Soon to be all the rage.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.964
Now, maggie...
- Eldritch,

21:06.966 --> 21:09.967
Someone has lied to you.
Either that,

21:09.969 --> 21:11.969
Or you've been less than
truthful with me.

21:11.971 --> 21:14.805
- You think I lied to you?

21:14.807 --> 21:17.275
- Whatever happened, the
situation was misrepresented.

21:17.277 --> 21:21.812
Now, I have a call in one hour
with the president.

21:21.814 --> 21:24.915
I am strongly recommending
that he declare martial law

21:24.917 --> 21:28.586
In new york city and order
a complete quarantine.

21:28.588 --> 21:30.955
- You're panicking, maggie.
It will mean the end

21:30.957 --> 21:33.991
Of your career.
- (scoffs): My career?

21:33.993 --> 21:38.629
Human beings are being converted
into these horrible monsters!

21:38.631 --> 21:42.166
We have absolute proof.
I know it sounds preposterous.

21:42.168 --> 21:44.902
- Preposterous, indeed.
- At the end of the day,

21:44.904 --> 21:47.471
Eldritch, my loyalty is
to the american people,

21:47.473 --> 21:51.108
Not to you. I'm sorry.
- Maggie,

21:51.110 --> 21:53.811
Could you and I
have a private talk?

22:12.464 --> 22:16.867
- Have you been in mr. Palmer's
employ for very long?

22:16.869 --> 22:21.639
- Oh, I'm not in his employ.

22:21.641 --> 22:25.376
(clearing throat)

22:25.378 --> 22:28.346
- Your accent...
Are you from germany?

22:28.348 --> 22:30.548
- Originally.

22:30.550 --> 22:35.820
- Uh... I once was in munich
for a conference.

22:35.822 --> 22:38.322
I didn't care for it.

22:38.324 --> 22:41.058
- You wouldn't.

22:41.060 --> 22:43.828
(chuckling)

22:43.830 --> 22:47.498
Oh, looks like the
conversation's coming to an end.

22:47.500 --> 22:50.701
(screaming)

22:50.703 --> 22:55.806
- Oh, my god! Maggie...
Oh, my god!

23:08.487 --> 23:10.721
- And this one?

23:12.591 --> 23:15.860
- Dr. Barnes,
do you have any thoughts

23:15.862 --> 23:18.662
On how to deal with
this so-called crisis?

23:18.664 --> 23:20.531
- Crisis? What crisis?

23:20.533 --> 23:24.034
- Well, say you were promoted
to secretary of health

23:24.036 --> 23:27.738
And human services in the wake
of maggie's tragic suicide,

23:27.740 --> 23:30.341
What do you think
should be done?

23:32.878 --> 23:35.413
- I think we should
stay the course.

23:35.415 --> 23:39.016
That is, if you want.

23:39.018 --> 23:41.452
- Now, if I remember correctly,

23:41.454 --> 23:44.455
Dr. Goodweather worked
under you at the cdc,

23:44.457 --> 23:47.691
Did he not?
- Goodweather went rogue.

23:47.693 --> 23:49.627
I told him to lay off.

23:49.629 --> 23:53.564
I got him fired.
I had him arrested by the fbi.

23:53.566 --> 23:55.866
I did everything I could do
to stop him.

24:00.372 --> 24:03.808
- I think we'll keep him.

24:09.648 --> 24:13.451
- Hey, zach.

24:13.453 --> 24:15.953
Turn that off?

24:15.955 --> 24:18.556
- What's up?

24:18.558 --> 24:21.559
- We're leaving.

24:21.561 --> 24:24.495
All of us, including you.

24:24.497 --> 24:27.131
- Son, this is for you.

24:27.133 --> 24:30.334
It is very sharp,
very dangerous.

24:30.336 --> 24:32.837
Handle it with great care.

24:43.248 --> 24:46.283
- This weapon
is forged from silver.

24:46.285 --> 24:48.752
Silver burns vampires.

24:50.455 --> 24:52.690
That's right,
you hold it with two hands.

24:52.692 --> 24:55.659
Grip it tightly.

24:59.364 --> 25:02.299
You want to show it
to them first.

25:02.301 --> 25:06.270
They fear silver.

25:11.643 --> 25:16.013
(voice breaking): Strike here,
if you can reach.

25:16.015 --> 25:19.783
If you can't,

25:19.785 --> 25:22.853
Strike here.
- Where there is no bone.

25:22.855 --> 25:24.822
The blade goes deeper.

25:24.824 --> 25:28.692
Quick thrusts: In and out,
in, out.

25:39.404 --> 25:42.406
- You know why we're doing this?
- Yeah.

25:44.809 --> 25:46.877
- Since the beginning
of creation,

25:46.879 --> 25:48.879
Boys have hunted
beside their fathers.

25:50.215 --> 25:53.751
This is no different.
- This is very different.

25:53.753 --> 25:56.654
We're fighting
to protect each other.

25:56.656 --> 25:59.423
We're going
to get through this.

25:59.425 --> 26:01.725
And we're going to win.

26:24.416 --> 26:28.752
- Remember, he will use whatever
advantage he can against us.

26:28.754 --> 26:31.255
Whatever you see,

26:31.257 --> 26:33.724
Whatever you hear,

26:33.726 --> 26:37.161
Do not stop until
the master is defeated.

26:41.967 --> 26:45.769
(door clanking)

26:48.440 --> 26:51.041
(door creaking open)

27:07.792 --> 27:10.961
- Ready?

27:10.963 --> 27:12.997
(door opening)

27:12.999 --> 27:17.201
(vampires growling)

27:22.574 --> 27:24.742
I knew it!

27:24.744 --> 27:29.146
Nice, huh?
(sizzling)

27:29.148 --> 27:32.282
- They won't hold.

27:32.284 --> 27:36.353
Now they've seen us, they'll
push through, sacrificing

27:36.355 --> 27:38.856
However many it takes so
the others can get through.

27:38.858 --> 27:40.924
- (fet): Remember when I, uh,

27:40.926 --> 27:44.461
Went back to my place
that one time?

27:44.463 --> 27:48.165
I grabbed a few things.
I've been saving these babies.

27:48.167 --> 27:51.468
- Is that--
- dynamite, yes.

27:51.470 --> 27:54.805
It's, uh, a common
exterminating tool.

27:54.807 --> 27:56.607
- You flatter me, doc.

27:56.609 --> 27:59.009
You guys might want
to get back in the tunnel.

27:59.011 --> 28:02.846
Munchers are
going boom-boom.

28:04.215 --> 28:06.550
Fire in the hole, vermin!

28:06.552 --> 28:10.921
(growling and screeching)

28:12.190 --> 28:15.359
(loud explosions)

28:30.241 --> 28:32.309
Good. Come on,

28:32.311 --> 28:34.712
We're good!

28:34.714 --> 28:38.282
Cover your nose.
Ammonia overload.

28:42.554 --> 28:45.656
(vampires snarling)

29:01.172 --> 29:03.707
- (the master): <i>Woodcarver...</i>

29:03.709 --> 29:07.911
- You're hearing him,
aren't you?

29:11.382 --> 29:14.251
- Now it's his turn to hear me!

29:16.554 --> 29:18.856
Let's finish this.

29:25.196 --> 29:28.432
Spread out and attack!

29:28.434 --> 29:31.201
(yelling)
(firing)

29:39.277 --> 29:42.279
- Dutch!
- No, wait!

29:42.281 --> 29:45.082
It's jaimie.

29:45.084 --> 29:48.652
She works at
a gallery in soho.

29:48.654 --> 29:52.289
(whispering): Oh, god!
(snarling)

29:52.291 --> 29:54.658
Bloody hell!

29:54.660 --> 29:58.362
Ahh!
(screeching)

30:08.606 --> 30:12.576
- Keep moving!
- Go find him, professor!

30:12.578 --> 30:14.778
You too, doc.

30:14.780 --> 30:17.147
We'll handle these munchers.

30:17.149 --> 30:18.949
Now, aim for the head!

30:18.951 --> 30:21.018
- Like that!
- Dad!

30:21.020 --> 30:24.087
- I got you, zach. Come on!
- That a girl.

30:28.593 --> 30:31.829
(snarling)
- (zach): Dad!

30:31.831 --> 30:34.765
- (eph): Zach!

30:49.380 --> 30:52.282
- (abraham): Clear this level.

30:56.888 --> 30:59.590
- (fet): Incoming!

31:01.292 --> 31:03.794
(gun clicking)
shit!

31:08.032 --> 31:10.167
- Ms. Velders!

31:10.169 --> 31:13.303
So I'll drink you first.
- Yeah, try it, asshole!

31:14.906 --> 31:17.441
(screaming)

31:28.853 --> 31:32.556
(screeching)

31:58.683 --> 32:00.951
(whispering voices)

32:00.953 --> 32:04.621
- (miriam): <i>Abraham...</i>
<i>Abraham, come to me!</i>

32:04.623 --> 32:07.024
<i>Abraham, I'm here!</i>

32:09.794 --> 32:14.498
<i>Abraham, come to me, please...</i>

32:17.602 --> 32:20.904
<i>Come to me!</i>

32:20.906 --> 32:23.206
<i>Abraham!</i>

32:24.876 --> 32:29.079
(thudding)
(snarling)

32:29.081 --> 32:32.449
- You wanted to find me,
woodcarver?

32:36.321 --> 32:40.123
Here I am.

32:47.131 --> 32:50.067
- I have waited for this day.

32:54.138 --> 32:57.207
- (eph): Break the windows,
let in the light!

32:59.344 --> 33:03.480
(groaning)

33:26.838 --> 33:29.840
(groaning)

33:31.376 --> 33:33.944
- It's over, <i>strigoi!</i>

33:42.553 --> 33:45.288
(sizzling)

33:48.059 --> 33:51.528
(eph yelling)

33:57.368 --> 34:00.137
- Come on!

34:09.814 --> 34:13.950
- (master): <i>Come to me!</i>

34:28.833 --> 34:31.535
(roaring)

34:31.537 --> 34:35.305
- In the name of all
that is holy!

34:39.610 --> 34:42.846
(screeching)

35:20.251 --> 35:21.885
- Where is he?

35:23.621 --> 35:27.357
- He ran down the building
and disappeared.

35:29.427 --> 35:32.629
- (fet): In direct sunlight?
- In direct sunlight.

35:32.631 --> 35:36.733
- I thought that
couldn't happen.

35:39.137 --> 35:42.139
I thought sunlight
would kill him!

35:42.141 --> 35:45.475
- What he did, I...

35:45.477 --> 35:49.513
Did not know
he was capable of doing.

35:49.515 --> 35:51.615
- But you injured him, right?
I mean,

35:51.617 --> 35:55.585
That's why the others ran off?
- I was wrong.

36:07.632 --> 36:10.700
- Well, if sunlight doesn't
kill him, what does?

36:15.706 --> 36:18.108
- We're lost.

36:38.696 --> 36:41.298
(grunting)

36:45.903 --> 36:47.871
- Don't do that again.

36:56.981 --> 37:00.150
- What is this? I've seen you
kill other vampires,

37:00.152 --> 37:03.587
And I know you've got a sting or
two. What do you want with me?

37:03.589 --> 37:07.724
- You work for the german.
- I don't work for nobody.

37:07.726 --> 37:09.826
I did a job
for him once

37:09.828 --> 37:12.562
And I regret it.
- You transported a box

37:12.564 --> 37:15.865
From the airport, across
the river, into manhattan.

37:15.867 --> 37:18.835
- Yeah, and I
owe him for that.

37:20.571 --> 37:23.907
He's number one on my list.

37:23.909 --> 37:27.077
- Do you know what
was in the box?

37:27.079 --> 37:30.046
- Whatever it was,
it cost me my mother.

37:30.048 --> 37:34.084
It cost me my best friend.

37:34.086 --> 37:36.052
It cost me everything.

37:36.054 --> 37:39.756
- Maybe you would like
some revenge?

37:41.459 --> 37:44.060
- Well, you know what?

37:44.062 --> 37:46.997
Now that you mention it...

37:52.770 --> 37:56.439
(running feet)

38:19.397 --> 38:22.699
Oh, what's up?
You brought your homeboys?

38:28.673 --> 38:32.375
(soft growling)

38:43.988 --> 38:46.589
Holy shit!

38:52.363 --> 38:56.933
- You are standing before
beings of great honor,

38:56.935 --> 38:59.636
Dignity, power.

38:59.638 --> 39:01.938
The ancients.

39:05.843 --> 39:09.846
- Are they alive?
- In a way.

39:09.848 --> 39:13.850
- I mean, can't they speak?
- I speak for them...

39:13.852 --> 39:15.285
For now.

39:18.155 --> 39:20.123
- Well, why is he
looking at me like that?

39:20.125 --> 39:22.058
- They're not looking at you.

39:22.060 --> 39:24.527
They're dreaming.

39:24.529 --> 39:27.664
If we wake them,
we'll have to feed them.

39:27.666 --> 39:29.733
I don't think
you'd enjoy that.

39:29.735 --> 39:33.136
An ancient truce
has been broken.

39:33.138 --> 39:35.739
An act of war
has been declared.

39:35.741 --> 39:38.341
We need a human soldier,

39:38.343 --> 39:41.077
Who can move freely
in the daylight.

39:41.079 --> 39:43.913
Someone who can use
the power of the sun

39:43.915 --> 39:46.816
To massacre the unclean.

39:46.818 --> 39:50.487
- You know what it
sounds like to me?

39:50.489 --> 39:53.523
Sounds like you got a vampire
turf war going on.

39:53.525 --> 39:57.394
- You have proven
yourself capable.

39:57.396 --> 39:59.362
- Why should I help them?

39:59.364 --> 40:02.866
...Or you?
- Payback.

40:02.868 --> 40:05.502
And a rich payday.

40:09.273 --> 40:12.709
- I'm listening.

40:12.711 --> 40:15.678
- We'll go to my place
to regroup.

40:15.680 --> 40:18.081
I have tools.

40:18.083 --> 40:20.450
(hyperventilating)

40:20.452 --> 40:24.320
- Zach, where's your inhaler?

40:32.630 --> 40:35.532
(dog barking)

40:38.235 --> 40:41.204
- The extra inhalers
are in there.

40:41.206 --> 40:45.208
Wait two minutes.
- Make it one, doc.

41:21.979 --> 41:24.581
- Okay, zach, I got it.
Come here. Come on!

41:30.588 --> 41:34.357
- You're not wheezing.
- You said we were

41:34.359 --> 41:36.159
Never coming back.

41:37.361 --> 41:40.096
- Did you do this just
to get this photo album?

41:42.633 --> 41:45.535
- It's dangerous here.

41:45.537 --> 41:47.470
- Where are we going?

41:47.472 --> 41:49.539
- Right now,
we're going to fet's.

41:49.541 --> 41:52.575
- How will mom find us?

41:58.148 --> 42:01.351
- She'll find us.

42:03.888 --> 42:07.690
I remember
that birthday party.

42:09.059 --> 42:11.127
We had that... That pony.

42:13.864 --> 42:18.635
And mom made that farm cake.
- Yeah, that was awesome.

42:18.637 --> 42:21.538
- I'm surprised
she kept all this.

42:21.540 --> 42:23.573
- She wouldn't just trash
all these pictures

42:23.575 --> 42:26.042
Just because you two split up.

42:28.579 --> 42:31.214
- Okay. Time to go.

42:31.216 --> 42:33.583
(kissing zach)

42:58.208 --> 43:00.843
(growling)

43:11.622 --> 43:13.623
<i>- Zach...</i>

43:13.625 --> 43:16.225
- No.

43:16.227 --> 43:19.262
- Mom!
<i>- Zach...</i>

43:20.030 --> 43:22.231
<i>Zach...</i>
<i>- Mom!</i>

43:22.233 --> 43:25.868
- No. It's not her!
- Mom! Let me go!

43:25.870 --> 43:29.939
- Stop it. Stop it, zach!
- No, mom!

43:29.941 --> 43:32.842
No, don't shoot her!
- It's not her anymore!

43:33.978 --> 43:38.281
- (zach): No!

43:41.151 --> 43:43.119
Mom!

43:44.555 --> 43:46.556
Mom!

43:46.558 --> 43:49.158
(whispering voices)

43:49.160 --> 43:52.895
(crying): Mom...

43:57.401 --> 44:00.470
- She was here?

44:00.472 --> 44:02.672
- Why aren't there
any more coming?

44:02.674 --> 44:05.775
- There will be. She won't stop.

44:05.777 --> 44:09.812
Not until she gets
what she wants.

44:09.814 --> 44:12.782
The master will use your wife,

44:12.784 --> 44:15.752
Her love
for your boy.

44:15.754 --> 44:17.620
- Eph... Don't.

44:17.622 --> 44:19.689
- (abraham): He'll use
your wife's love

44:19.691 --> 44:21.824
For her son to pursue us.

44:21.826 --> 44:26.095
To the ends of the earth,
if necessary.

44:39.209 --> 44:43.246
- Let him try.

44:46.016 --> 44:48.951
- (abraham): <i>Too long</i>
<i>I've lived,</i>

44:48.953 --> 44:52.188
<i>Too much I've seen.</i>

44:52.190 --> 44:54.857
<i>This planet, our host,</i>

44:54.859 --> 44:59.028
<i>Once so wild and unknown;</i>

44:59.030 --> 45:01.798
<i>We've mapped it, paved it,</i>

45:01.800 --> 45:04.667
<i>Arranged it on a grid,</i>

45:04.669 --> 45:07.303
<i>Never imagining</i>

45:07.305 --> 45:09.906
<i>That something else</i>
<i>was watching us,</i>

45:09.908 --> 45:12.709
<i>A creature even more</i>
<i>ruthless and predacious</i>

45:12.711 --> 45:14.911
<i>Than we are,</i>

45:14.913 --> 45:17.747
<i>Eager to exploit</i>
<i>the very infrastructure</i>

45:17.749 --> 45:20.550
<i>We so obligingly arranged.</i>

45:23.754 --> 45:26.222
<i>Is the war already lost?</i>

45:26.224 --> 45:29.592
<i>Are we destined to be</i>
<i>cattle for monsters?</i>

45:29.594 --> 45:34.330
<i>Or, now that the enemy</i>
<i>has finally shown his face,</i>

45:34.332 --> 45:38.234
<i>Do we have a fighting chance?</i>

45:41.939 --> 45:46.409
<i>The world today is not</i>
<i>what it was one week ago.</i>

45:46.411 --> 45:49.512
<i>What will it be</i>
<i>one week from now?</i>

45:49.514 --> 45:51.447
<i>One month from now?</i>

45:51.449 --> 45:54.851
<i>Nothing is written</i>
<i>that cannot be changed.</i>

45:54.853 --> 45:57.286
It is a small world, after all.

45:57.288 --> 46:00.189
<i>We made it that way.</i>

46:02.693 --> 46:04.927
(sirens)
