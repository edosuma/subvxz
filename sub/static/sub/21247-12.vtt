WEBVTT

00:01.686 --> 00:04.253
RAFIKI: And this is
the Kupatana Celebration,

00:05.056 --> 00:08.090
when everyone
in the Pride Lands
gathers in peace

00:08.125 --> 00:11.060
to watch
the baobab flowers bloom.

00:11.328 --> 00:13.362
Oh! It's so pretty, Rafiki!

00:14.031 --> 00:17.399
(CHUCKLES) Yes, Makini.
And as Royal Mjuzi,

00:17.435 --> 00:21.036
you will need to know
all of the Pride Lands'
celebrations.

00:21.172 --> 00:24.306
Oh, good! 'Cause I want to
learn all the Pride Lands
celebrations!

00:24.341 --> 00:26.475
What's this one, Rafiki?
Is that Timon?

00:26.510 --> 00:29.211
Ah, yes, it is.

00:29.246 --> 00:32.481
Timon is placing a star fruit
at the top
of his Christmas tree.

00:32.516 --> 00:35.317
Christmas tree?
But it looks like
an acacia tree.

00:36.053 --> 00:39.388
(CHUCKLES) Of course!
You are new
to the Pride Lands.

00:39.423 --> 00:42.191
You have not yet celebrated
Christmas with us.

00:42.226 --> 00:44.059
Christmas? What's Christmas?

00:44.361 --> 00:47.262
It is the most wonderful
celebration of all.

00:47.465 --> 00:49.465
Would you like to hear
the story of how

00:49.500 --> 00:53.102
Timon and Pumbaa introduced
Christmas to the Pride Lands?

00:53.137 --> 00:56.338
Oh, yes!
Please, please, please!

00:56.373 --> 00:58.140
Very well.

00:58.175 --> 01:03.278
It begins with the appearance
of a special star
high in the sky.

01:05.015 --> 01:08.984
<i> On the day before Christmas,</i>
<i> a star shines so bright.</i>

01:09.019 --> 01:13.021
<i> All over the Pride Lands,</i>
<i> it is seen day and night.</i>

01:17.328 --> 01:19.061
(KION READING)

01:28.239 --> 01:32.174
<i> ♪ Jungle smells,</i>
<i> jungle smells,</i>
<i> jungle all the way</i>

01:32.209 --> 01:33.375
<i> ♪ Oh, what fun it is to... ♪</i>

01:33.410 --> 01:35.010
PUMBAA: Uh, Timon?

01:35.045 --> 01:37.246
That's not the way
I remember the song.

01:37.381 --> 01:40.449
Come on, Pumbaa.
How can you not remember?

01:40.484 --> 01:42.384
We sing it every Christmas.

01:42.520 --> 01:44.019
I-I know, but...

01:44.054 --> 01:47.289
There! Pumbaa? Bunga?
Whaddaya think, eh?

01:48.325 --> 01:49.291
Let's see.

01:50.127 --> 01:53.061
Oh, it's beautiful, Timon.

01:53.097 --> 01:55.164
Yeah, Uncle Timon,
it's perfect.

01:55.332 --> 01:57.065
Almost perfect.

01:57.101 --> 02:00.302
We still need the star fruit
for the top of the tree.

02:01.038 --> 02:03.205
One star fruit, coming up.

02:04.341 --> 02:05.340
Here you go.

02:05.376 --> 02:07.042
Thanks, Bunga.

02:07.077 --> 02:10.045
Now for
the "piece de resistance!"

02:13.417 --> 02:16.018
There. All done.

02:16.053 --> 02:17.085
(YELLING)

02:17.121 --> 02:18.086
Oh, Timon!

02:18.422 --> 02:20.455
I gotcha!<i> Zuka Zama!</i>

02:21.258 --> 02:22.224
Whoops.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.193
(GROANS)

02:25.129 --> 02:26.261
Thanks, Beshte.

02:26.297 --> 02:29.298
We heard you shouting.
Good thing we were close by.

02:29.333 --> 02:31.300
Why were you
in that tree, anyway?

02:31.335 --> 02:34.236
And why are there gourds
hanging all over it?

02:34.271 --> 02:38.307
Because it's a Christmas tree.
See that big star up there?

02:38.342 --> 02:40.209
That means
tomorrow is Christmas.

02:40.377 --> 02:41.443
<i> Poa!</i>

02:42.279 --> 02:44.046
Uh, what's Christmas?

02:44.248 --> 02:46.348
BOTH: "What's Christmas"?

02:47.051 --> 02:49.284
It's this great holiday
my uncles made up.

02:49.320 --> 02:52.087
Ho, ho, no!
We did not make it up!

02:52.122 --> 02:53.255
Timon's right.

02:53.290 --> 02:55.190
We heard about it from an ox,

02:55.226 --> 02:57.159
who heard it
from a yellow wagtail,

02:57.194 --> 02:59.194
who heard it
from a flying reindeer!

02:59.230 --> 03:01.163
Flying reindeer?
Reindeer don't...

03:02.032 --> 03:03.165
The point is,

03:03.200 --> 03:06.435
Christmas is a wonderful day
when we all get presents!

03:06.470 --> 03:10.138
It's more like a time to be
with your friends and family.

03:10.274 --> 03:13.175
It's all about
the spirit of giving!

03:13.410 --> 03:15.043
You mean "getting."

03:15.079 --> 03:18.313
I'm pretty sure
it's "giving."

03:19.049 --> 03:21.250
Actually, you can't have
getting without giving.

03:21.285 --> 03:23.018
Or giving without getting.

03:23.153 --> 03:25.254
But you know what
the best part of Christmas is?

03:25.289 --> 03:27.089
Dandy Claws!

03:27.124 --> 03:30.025
Dandy Claws?
Is that a who or a what?

03:30.094 --> 03:32.361
Oh! He's a big red guy
with fluffy white whiskers.

03:33.030 --> 03:37.232
And on Christmas morning,
he leaves lots of presents
under the Christmas tree!

03:37.268 --> 03:40.135
Yeah, Christmas is the best!

So this Dandy Claws
brings you gifts
every year?

05:59.043 --> 06:02.044
Yes. That is, well...

06:02.212 --> 06:03.345
No.

06:03.380 --> 06:07.983
Dandy Claws has never come.
And I'm afraid he never will.

06:08.018 --> 06:10.018
(CRYING)

06:10.988 --> 06:11.953
Why not?

06:13.090 --> 06:17.059
Well, from what we've heard,
Dandy Claws only comes

06:17.094 --> 06:22.164
if you perform a special song
under the Christmas tree
on Christmas morning.

06:22.366 --> 06:25.100
It's called<i> The Twelve Ways</i>
<i>of Christmas.</i>

06:25.235 --> 06:28.003
It's got leaping lions,
bouncing berries,

06:28.038 --> 06:30.305
falling fruit,
all sorts of stuff.

06:30.340 --> 06:33.208
Yeah, but you can't
just sing about 'em!

06:33.243 --> 06:36.378
They gotta be there!
It's a huge production!

06:37.014 --> 06:38.980
Animals, fruit, bugs.

06:40.084 --> 06:41.216
It's too much.

06:41.251 --> 06:44.286
I've tried, but I've never
been able to do it.

06:44.321 --> 06:47.122
It's impossible!

06:47.157 --> 06:52.360
And that's why Dandy Claws
will never come
and bring me gifts!

06:52.396 --> 06:54.229
Oh, cheer up, Timon.

06:54.398 --> 06:58.066
Bunga and I give you gifts
every Christmas.

06:58.102 --> 06:59.101
Yeah!

06:59.136 --> 07:01.203
I know,
and they're always great.

07:01.238 --> 07:05.373
But just once,
I'd like Dandy Claws
to bring me something, too.

07:06.043 --> 07:09.277
Well, who knows?
Maybe someday he will.

07:10.047 --> 07:12.214
(SIGHS) Maybe.

07:13.383 --> 07:17.953
Okay. Well, time for one more
patrol before Christmas.

07:17.988 --> 07:19.287
Bunga, you coming?

07:19.323 --> 07:20.288
Okay.

07:21.291 --> 07:24.059
See ya, Uncle Pumbaa.
Bye, Uncle Timon.

07:24.094 --> 07:25.327
So long, Bunga.

07:25.362 --> 07:27.028
Yeah, see ya.

07:29.199 --> 07:30.365
(SIGHS)

07:30.400 --> 07:32.067
You okay, Little B?

07:32.102 --> 07:35.003
Yeah, I just wish I could
make Dandy Claws appear

07:35.038 --> 07:37.172
and have Uncle Timon's
Christmas dream come true.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.107
Well, maybe we can.

07:39.143 --> 07:40.442
But we'd have to do
that song.

07:40.477 --> 07:42.410
<i> The Twelve Ways</i>
<i> of Christmas?</i>

07:43.046 --> 07:44.446
Timon said it's impossible.

07:44.481 --> 07:48.183
And tomorrow's Christmas!
We'd have to get everything
ready today!

07:48.385 --> 07:50.118
So? We're the Lion Guard.

07:50.287 --> 07:52.320
We do the impossible
all the time.

07:52.356 --> 07:55.190
Ooh, yeah, we do,
don't we?

07:55.225 --> 07:56.358
Okay, Little B, I'm in.

07:57.394 --> 07:58.393
Me, too.

07:58.428 --> 07:59.961
Affirmative.

07:59.997 --> 08:01.363
Yes! Thanks, everybody.

08:02.866 --> 08:06.034
Okay. Bunga, what do we need
for<i> The Twelve Ways</i>
<i> of Christmas?</i>

08:06.236 --> 08:07.335
Oh, so much!

08:08.005 --> 08:09.371
Bugs a-crawling,
fruit a-falling,

08:09.406 --> 08:11.239
lions leaping,
trunks a-honking...

08:11.275 --> 08:13.942
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I never thought I'd say this,

08:13.977 --> 08:16.044
but slow down!

08:16.079 --> 08:18.280
Maybe you should start
from the beginning.

08:18.315 --> 08:20.982
Okay, so the song
goes like this.

08:21.185 --> 08:24.386
<i> ♪ For the First Way</i>
<i> of Christmas,</i>
<i> my good friends gave to me</i>

08:25.088 --> 08:31.993
<i> ♪ In a baobab tree ♪</i>

08:33.397 --> 08:35.130
And that's it.
What do you think?

08:35.332 --> 08:39.401
Sounds like a big job,
but if we split up,
I think we can do it.

08:39.436 --> 08:42.370
We'll divide up
the things and animals
we have to gather,

08:42.406 --> 08:44.239
and meet back
at Hakuna Matata Falls.

08:44.374 --> 08:49.211
Sure! This is gonna be
the most un-Bunga-lievable
Christmas ever!

08:49.413 --> 08:51.346
Ooh, but don't let Timon
and Pumbaa see you!

08:51.381 --> 08:53.114
I really want it
to be a surprise!

08:53.483 --> 08:57.118
Dandy Claws? I don't like
the sound of that.

08:57.154 --> 08:58.386
I think it sounds like fun.

08:59.056 --> 09:01.389
Can we, Ma Tembo? Please?

09:01.425 --> 09:03.358
What was it you said
we'd be doing?

09:03.994 --> 09:05.293
Um, a-honking?

09:06.029 --> 09:08.296
Hear that?
It's a performance!

09:08.332 --> 09:11.099
Hmm. I do love to perform.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.934
And Beshte's like family.

09:13.170 --> 09:17.005
We elephants would be
delighted to be in your
Christmas performance.

09:17.307 --> 09:19.307
Yay! (TRUMPETS)

09:19.443 --> 09:21.309
<i> Poa!</i> It'll be great!

09:22.446 --> 09:24.279
SIMBA: You want me
to do what?

09:25.015 --> 09:26.381
Oh, come on, Dad,
please?

09:27.084 --> 09:29.017
It's for Timon and Pumbaa.

09:29.052 --> 09:31.419
Just think of all
they've done for you
over the years, Simba.

09:31.455 --> 09:34.289
And besides,
you might enjoy yourself.

09:34.458 --> 09:37.125
Mom's right, Dad.
I think you'll have fun.

09:37.361 --> 09:40.061
Fine, I'll be in your song.

09:40.197 --> 09:41.196
Thanks, Dad.

09:41.231 --> 09:44.032
But if I'm going to do it,
so are you.

09:44.234 --> 09:45.300
Both of you.

09:46.503 --> 09:49.237
Actually, we need all of you.
And Tiifu and Zuri, too.

09:49.273 --> 09:51.973
Great! We can all
leap together!

09:52.009 --> 09:54.075
Kion, you can count on us.

09:54.111 --> 09:56.177
Thanks, everybody.
Now I gotta go.

09:56.213 --> 09:59.080
You won't believe
all the things we need
for this song!

09:59.116 --> 10:00.382
And Merry Christmas!

10:00.417 --> 10:03.318
Uh, Merry Christmas?

10:03.353 --> 10:05.086
Merry Christmas, Kion.

10:05.122 --> 10:06.454
Yes, whatever that means.

10:09.359 --> 10:10.392
Ooh!

10:12.195 --> 10:15.297
Big, fat, juicy,
delicious-looking bugs.

10:15.332 --> 10:18.266
Bunga? You're saving those
for the song, right?

10:19.102 --> 10:21.002
(SIGHS) Yeah.

10:35.052 --> 10:36.051
Whatcha up to?

10:36.086 --> 10:37.352
Nothing. Just hangin' out.

10:37.387 --> 10:40.121
Not looking for anything
squirmy, what you doing?

10:40.157 --> 10:43.191
Oh, who, me? Uh, nothing.

10:43.327 --> 10:48.229
I'm definitely not lookin' for
a special Christmas surprise
for Timon, I'll tell ya that.

10:48.265 --> 10:50.198
Yeah, us neither.

10:50.233 --> 10:53.368
Well, me and Ono got, uh,
Lion Guard stuff to do.

10:53.403 --> 10:54.436
Talk to ya later.

10:54.471 --> 10:56.104
Okay. See ya, Bunga.

10:57.207 --> 11:00.041
Ooh. White flowers. Perfect.

11:01.111 --> 11:02.210
(GULPS)

11:02.379 --> 11:05.347
Hey! I thought we were
saving 'em for the song!

11:05.382 --> 11:07.248
You put them in my mouth!

11:07.284 --> 11:09.351
But I didn't say
you could swallow 'em.

11:09.386 --> 11:12.187
(SIGHS) Guess we gotta
start all over.

11:13.156 --> 11:14.422
(GRUNTS)

11:14.458 --> 11:17.325
How did I get stuck
with gathering berries?

11:17.361 --> 11:18.426
(GRUNTS)

11:18.462 --> 11:20.395
VOICE: Hey, down there,
young cheetah!

11:20.430 --> 11:22.130
Huh? Who's up there?

11:23.100 --> 11:24.466
It's me! Uroho!

11:24.501 --> 11:27.168
And the amazing
Mwizi and Mwevi!

11:27.204 --> 11:30.338
You might know us as
<i>The Traveling Baboon Show!</i>

11:30.474 --> 11:33.208
Oh, yeah. I remember you.

11:33.243 --> 11:36.211
Looks like you could
use some help
reaching those berries!

11:36.246 --> 11:39.214
(SIGHS)
Yeah, I guess I could.

11:39.249 --> 11:42.117
Come on, fellas.
Help the cheetah out.

11:56.166 --> 12:00.301
I never thought I'd say this,
but thank you, baboons.

12:00.337 --> 12:03.204
So, what do you need
the berries for?

12:03.240 --> 12:05.240
They're for, uh,
a performance.

12:05.409 --> 12:07.442
Kinda silly,
but it's for a friend.

12:08.145 --> 12:11.112
You know,
we need some baboons, too.

12:11.148 --> 12:13.314
Something else
I never thought I'd say.

12:13.350 --> 12:16.418
A performance, huh?
We are intrigued.

12:16.453 --> 12:18.019
Tell us more, please.

12:18.054 --> 12:21.990
Okay, well, have you ever
heard of Christmas?

12:26.163 --> 12:30.064
Hmm. That is one
strange-looking acacia tree.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.232
It's pretty, though.

12:31.435 --> 12:34.269
It must be the Christmas Tree
Kion told us about.

12:35.439 --> 12:37.038
Hey, you made it.

12:37.207 --> 12:39.073
Are we the first ones here?

12:39.109 --> 12:41.476
Uh, not exactly. Come on!

12:45.248 --> 12:48.316
Oh, my.
This is a big production.

12:48.485 --> 12:51.252
Okay, everybody,
you gotta pay attention,

12:51.288 --> 12:53.488
'cause we've only got till
sunrise to get this right.

12:54.191 --> 12:55.390
I already know what to do.

12:56.159 --> 12:57.492
(TRUMPETS)

12:57.527 --> 13:00.395
Shh! Not so loud!
You'll wake up Uncle Timon
and Uncle Pumbaa!

13:00.430 --> 13:01.463
Sorry.

13:01.498 --> 13:04.432
Hakuna Matata. Just save it
for the performance.

13:04.468 --> 13:07.101
SIMBA: What about us?
What do we do?

13:07.137 --> 13:08.403
One at a time, okay?

13:09.005 --> 13:12.173
Oh. Hi, Your Highnesses.

13:12.476 --> 13:14.275
Didn't see you there.

13:14.311 --> 13:17.111
Don't let us interrupt you,
Bunga. You were saying?

13:17.147 --> 13:18.646
Uh, yeah.

13:18.682 --> 13:22.383
So, we need to do the song
perfectly if we want
Dandy Claws to show up!

13:22.419 --> 13:23.418
But no pressure.

13:23.453 --> 13:25.353
Right, right.
No pressure.

13:25.388 --> 13:28.056
Don't worry, Little B.
It's gonna be great.

13:28.091 --> 13:30.258
Wait.
Who's Dandy Claws again?

13:31.228 --> 13:34.062
The rest of you remember
Dandy Claws, right?

13:34.197 --> 13:35.330
ALL: No!

13:36.099 --> 13:38.099
This is going to be
a long night.

13:38.268 --> 13:40.401
BUNGA: Okay,
from the beginning.

13:43.373 --> 13:48.476
ANIMALS:
<i> ♪ And a rhino</i>
<i> in a baobab tree ♪</i>

13:49.145 --> 13:51.179
That was great.
Thanks, everyone.

13:51.414 --> 13:53.348
Yeah, well,
we're getting closer.

13:53.517 --> 13:55.316
Okay, from the beginning.

13:55.452 --> 13:57.252
(ALL GROAN)

13:57.287 --> 14:00.288
Bunga, we've been practicing
all night long.

14:00.991 --> 14:03.291
I know, but it needs
to be perfect.

14:03.326 --> 14:06.361
Bunga, we're out of time.
The sun's about to come up.

14:06.396 --> 14:08.296
If we haven't learned it
by now,

14:08.331 --> 14:10.198
I don't know if we ever will.

14:11.001 --> 14:12.233
Oh, well, we gave it a try.

14:12.402 --> 14:13.468
Maybe next year.

14:15.305 --> 14:18.172
I never really got the whole
Christmas thing anyway.

14:19.042 --> 14:20.041
Oh.

14:20.076 --> 14:21.209
Sorry, Little B.

14:21.244 --> 14:24.045
No. Wait.
Everybody, stop!

14:25.382 --> 14:27.282
We can't just give up
like this.

14:27.317 --> 14:28.583
Please?

14:28.618 --> 14:33.121
Kion, Bunga, what's so
important about this...
"Christmas"?

14:33.156 --> 14:36.357
Well, Pumbaa says Christmas
is all about the spirit
of giving.

14:36.393 --> 14:39.427
And him and Uncle Timon
are the only family I have.

14:39.462 --> 14:42.263
They took me in
when I was little,
and all alone.

14:42.465 --> 14:44.165
They took you in, too.

14:44.401 --> 14:46.334
Yes, they did.

14:46.369 --> 14:48.202
They've given me everything.

14:48.238 --> 14:52.073
So this Christmas, I wanna
give them a performance
they won't forget.

14:52.275 --> 14:57.111
Okay, Bunga.
Then that is exactly
what we are going to do.

14:57.147 --> 14:58.146
Right, everyone?

14:58.181 --> 15:00.281
Of course, Your Majesty.

15:00.317 --> 15:02.183
The show must go on.

15:02.319 --> 15:05.987
Great! The sun's rising
and time's a-wasting!

15:06.022 --> 15:06.988
Let's go!

15:09.159 --> 15:10.425

15:14.431 --> 15:15.396
Grubs, grubs...

15:16.132 --> 15:18.099
Uncle Timon, Uncle Pumbaa!

15:18.134 --> 15:20.001
Wake up, it's Christmas!

15:20.303 --> 15:21.369
What, what, huh?

15:22.138 --> 15:25.106
Whoa, Christmas already?
Hear that, Timon?

15:25.141 --> 15:29.277
(YAWNS) You know what?
I'm gonna give Christmas
a pass this year.

15:29.446 --> 15:31.446
BOTH: Huh? You're what?

15:31.481 --> 15:34.248
Who needs the disappointment?

15:35.185 --> 15:36.351
I'm gonna sleep in.

15:36.386 --> 15:39.354
No, you're not!
It's Christmas!

15:39.389 --> 15:42.323
A special day
we look forward to
all year long!

15:42.492 --> 15:46.194
And who knows?
This just might be
the best one ever!

15:46.363 --> 15:49.263
Yeah, I don't know
about that. But okay.

15:49.299 --> 15:50.365
Great. Come on!

15:50.400 --> 15:51.466
(TIMON YELLS)

15:57.140 --> 15:59.107

15:59.142 --> 16:00.575
Watch.

16:00.610 --> 16:04.078
This is the year we're finally
going to get a visit

after such a great
performance,

20:41.291 --> 20:43.057
Dandy Claws would come.

20:43.359 --> 20:45.126
Well...

Well, you always wanted
Dandy Claws to show up
on Christmas,

20:59.442 --> 21:02.443
so I decided,
this year, he would.

21:02.478 --> 21:04.278

it took so long to put
this costume together,

I don't have any gifts
to give you.

21:10.420 --> 21:11.986
Sorry, Timon.

21:13.122 --> 21:14.989

on Christmas day!

21:19.228 --> 21:22.396
But you said Christmas
was all about gifts.

21:23.032 --> 21:25.066
And we got gifts. Look!

21:25.268 --> 21:27.435
Berries, bugs, fruit!

21:28.104 --> 21:30.371
But we also got
lots of friends.

21:31.074 --> 21:34.041
And family.
All right here.

21:34.210 --> 21:37.445
And they're the best gifts
anybody could ask for.

21:38.081 --> 21:40.214
Oh, you're right, Timon.

21:40.350 --> 21:42.450
And you know what
this sounds like to me?

21:43.219 --> 21:47.188
BOTH:
It's the best Christmas ever!

21:47.323 --> 21:49.290
Wow. Thanks, guys!

21:49.325 --> 21:50.524
Sure, Bunga.

21:50.560 --> 21:54.028
You know, I think we should
celebrate Christmas
every year.

21:54.063 --> 21:55.062
Me, too.

21:55.098 --> 21:56.063
Affirmative.

21:56.332 --> 21:59.166
ALL: Merry Christmas!

22:00.603 --> 22:04.238
RAFIKI: And that is how
Timon and Pumbaa
introduced the Pride Lands

22:04.273 --> 22:07.375
to the special day
known as Christmas.

22:08.077 --> 22:10.444
It celebrates the gift
of family, friends,

22:10.480 --> 22:13.180
and the joy
of being together.

22:13.483 --> 22:15.182
You know what I think,
Rafiki?

22:15.351 --> 22:18.319
I think Christmas
celebrates the gift
of the circle of life.

22:18.354 --> 22:20.087
(CHUCKLES)

22:20.123 --> 22:21.389
Yes, young Mjuzi.

22:22.058 --> 22:24.191
I could not have said it
better myself.
