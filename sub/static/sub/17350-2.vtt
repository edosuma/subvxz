WEBVTT

00:12.167 --> 00:14.567
ALAN: Wow, great idea
coming out here, Brains.

00:14.633 --> 00:16.600
BRAINS: It's a r-rare
opportunity, Alan.

00:16.667 --> 00:20.633
The Leonid meteor shower
is only this strong
every 33 years.

00:20.700 --> 00:24.367
And seeing those
tiny carbonaceous deposits
vaporize in the atmosphere

00:24.433 --> 00:26.900
always gives me a warm,
happy glow.

00:26.967 --> 00:30.333
ALAN: Yeah, you said it...
I think.

00:30.400 --> 00:33.233
GRANDMA: You've been
awfully quiet tonight, Scott.

00:33.300 --> 00:34.567
Something on your mind?

00:34.633 --> 00:36.567
Oh, (SIGHING) just admiring
the view, Grandma.

00:36.633 --> 00:40.867
(CHUCKLING) A full-on meteor
shower and here you are
staring at the Moon.

00:40.933 --> 00:42.900
Not that I'm surprised.

00:42.967 --> 00:47.200
Your father was the same way
before he became an astronaut.

00:47.267 --> 00:49.467
(BOTH SIGHING)

00:49.533 --> 00:51.233
Sometimes I wonder
what it would've been like

00:51.300 --> 00:53.933
for Neil Armstrong to land
there a hundred years ago.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.933
-Don't look at me,
I'm not that old!
-(CHUCKLES)

00:57.000 --> 00:59.900
Boy, it's really coming down.

01:00.067 --> 01:02.667
Base to Thunderbird 5.
Everything all right
up there, John?

01:02.733 --> 01:05.433
I'm fine, but we may have
a situation developing.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.233
According to my readings,
this meteor shower's

01:07.300 --> 01:09.933
about to become
a perfect storm.

01:10.067 --> 01:11.633
I'm showing multiple
debris fields,

01:11.700 --> 01:13.433
projected to hit
the far side of the moon,

01:13.500 --> 01:15.600
right on top
of Shadow Alpha One.

01:15.667 --> 01:18.267
SCOTT: Dad's old Moon base?
I thought it was abandoned.

01:18.333 --> 01:19.733
I checked the crew manifest.

01:19.800 --> 01:21.367
-Captain Taylor
is still up there.
-(BEEPING)

01:21.433 --> 01:23.233
And he's not responding
to my calls.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.400
-SCOTT: Has the base been hit?
-Not yet.

01:25.467 --> 01:28.533
If we don't get up there soon,
Dad's best friend is history.

01:43.833 --> 01:45.100
ANNOUNCER: Five.

01:45.833 --> 01:47.067
Four.

01:47.833 --> 01:49.167
Three.

01:49.833 --> 01:51.067
Two.

01:52.433 --> 01:53.700
One.

02:21.933 --> 02:23.733
Thunderbirds are go!

02:28.567 --> 02:31.367
SCOTT: Thunderbird 5,
how long before the first
meteor wave makes contact?

02:31.433 --> 02:33.667
JOHN: Less than 30 minutes.
And the strikes
will only get worse

02:33.733 --> 02:36.067
as the moon orbits deeper
into the debris field.

02:36.100 --> 02:37.600
Keep trying to make contact.

02:37.667 --> 02:39.667
Alan and I will
fly Thunderbird 3
up to the station

02:39.733 --> 02:41.300
and see if the captain
needs a lift.

02:41.367 --> 02:43.567
Sweet! Thunderbirds are go!

02:45.467 --> 02:47.933
Oh, sorry. Did...
Did you want to say that?

02:48.067 --> 02:49.200
Forget it.

03:29.433 --> 03:34.333
ANNOUNCER:
Five, four, three, two, one.

03:45.333 --> 03:47.767
ALAN: Thunderbird 3 is go!

04:00.500 --> 04:02.433
SCOTT: Thunderbird 5,
any word from Captain Taylor?

04:02.500 --> 04:04.633
JOHN: Still quiet.
I went through
the station's log book

04:04.700 --> 04:06.633
while you guys were
gearing up.

04:06.700 --> 04:09.267
Turns out Shadow Alpha One
was decommissioned
six months ago.

04:09.333 --> 04:11.433
So, why would the captain
still be up there?

04:11.500 --> 04:14.067
And since when has Lee Taylor
been quiet about anything?

04:14.067 --> 04:15.900
I... Can we just go
back a step?

04:15.967 --> 04:17.767
What's this guy's story?

04:17.833 --> 04:20.067
Well, he and Dad were
part of the original team
that built the base.

04:20.067 --> 04:21.400
You may be too young
to remember, Alan,

04:21.467 --> 04:23.867
but Captain Taylor used to
assist International Rescue

04:23.933 --> 04:25.533
when we were first
starting out.

04:25.600 --> 04:28.300
And the stories he could
tell about life in space
were pretty wild.

04:28.367 --> 04:29.800
Even by Dad's standards.

04:29.867 --> 04:32.667
Taylor literally wrote
the book on lunar survival.

04:32.733 --> 04:36.133
Problem is, that book
was written a long time ago.

05:10.867 --> 05:13.167
I have a visual
on the station.

05:13.233 --> 05:14.967
Well, (CLEARS THROAT)
no time for a landing.

05:15.067 --> 05:17.567
Open the outer hatch
and I'll drop down
to the surface.

05:17.633 --> 05:19.767
Once I'm out, move clear
of the strike zone.

05:19.833 --> 05:22.300
We can't risk our ride home
getting damaged.

05:22.367 --> 05:25.567
Remember, the gravity
of the Moon is a lot less
than back on Earth.

05:25.633 --> 05:28.133
(SCOFFS) It's just a
simple landing, Alan.

05:28.200 --> 05:29.733
Don't say I didn't warn ya.

05:29.800 --> 05:33.367
Commencing drop
in three, two, one.

05:40.533 --> 05:42.200
ALAN: Scott, you're
coming in too wide.

05:42.267 --> 05:45.267
SCOTT: Don't worry,
Thunderbird 3,
adjusting the angle now.

05:46.067 --> 05:48.267
(YELPING) Whoa!

05:49.433 --> 05:50.800
(GRUNTING)

05:57.200 --> 05:58.733
SCOTT: We don't have time
for this.

05:58.800 --> 06:00.233
I'm cutting the pack.

06:02.333 --> 06:04.767
(SCOTT YELLING AND GROANING)

06:09.067 --> 06:11.533
ALAN: Tell me again how
simple the landing will be?

06:11.600 --> 06:15.133
SCOTT: Oh, I miss Earth.
John, what's my time?

06:15.200 --> 06:17.333
JOHN: Meteor impact
in five minutes.

06:18.167 --> 06:23.333
(OPERA MUSIC PLAYING FAINTLY)

06:26.500 --> 06:29.467
(BEEPING)

06:29.533 --> 06:32.700
(EXHALING)
Air seems breathable.

06:34.533 --> 06:37.233
Looks like I'm not the
only one who knows it.

06:38.633 --> 06:42.500
(MUSIC CONTINUES)

06:45.667 --> 06:47.633
-Hello?
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUD ON TAPE)

06:47.700 --> 06:49.067
Anyone home?

06:49.867 --> 06:52.533
-(BANGING)
-TAYLOR: Aah!

06:54.233 --> 06:56.300
Uh, Captain Taylor?

06:57.100 --> 06:58.133
(GASPS)

06:58.200 --> 06:59.767
TAYLOR: Well,
as I live and breathe.

06:59.833 --> 07:02.700
You're one of Jeff's boys,
aren't you?

07:02.767 --> 07:05.200
Don't tell me. Spencer? Cecil?

07:05.267 --> 07:07.733
-Uh, it's Scott, sir.
-That's the one!

07:07.800 --> 07:11.467
Why, you must have
grown two feet since
the last time I saw you.

07:11.533 --> 07:14.833
Sorry about the mess,
been having some
equipment problems.

07:14.900 --> 07:16.300
Yeah, I can tell.

07:16.367 --> 07:17.733
Half my day's been spent

07:17.800 --> 07:20.233
patching up Alfie's
central power relays.

07:20.300 --> 07:23.600
-Alfie?
-Excuse me, Shadow Alpha Base.

07:23.667 --> 07:25.633
My old home away from home.
(GUFFAWS)

07:25.700 --> 07:27.600
Captain Taylor,
I came to warn you,

07:27.667 --> 07:29.900
there's a massive field
of meteors coming this way.

07:29.967 --> 07:31.367
(TAYLOR GRUNTS)

07:31.433 --> 07:34.633
There, that should get this
bucket of bolts running again.

07:34.700 --> 07:36.700
(BEEPING)

07:37.500 --> 07:38.700
Leonids again.

07:38.767 --> 07:41.233
I figured they'd be
back one of these days.

07:41.300 --> 07:42.600
I've got Thunderbird 3
standing by.

07:42.667 --> 07:44.367
If we hurry,
we can make it out.

07:44.433 --> 07:47.600
Son, by the proximity
of that storm, we're not
going anywhere.

07:47.667 --> 07:49.200
Sir, we've got to
get out of here.

07:49.267 --> 07:51.933
Whoa, whoa,
slow your roll, kid.

07:52.067 --> 07:53.567
This is the far side
of the Moon.

07:53.633 --> 07:56.600
I eat meteors like this
for breakfast.

07:56.667 --> 07:58.767
Jeff and I used to
sprinkle them in our coffee

07:58.833 --> 08:01.733
with some dehydrated cream
on the side. (CHUCKLES)

08:08.500 --> 08:10.267
Meet the ODDM.

08:10.333 --> 08:12.733
Orbiting Debris
Defense Module.

08:12.800 --> 08:15.467
Your father and I came up
with it back in '27.

08:15.533 --> 08:17.433
With this baby at full power,

08:18.633 --> 08:20.733
those meteors don't
stand a chance.

08:23.800 --> 08:25.867
And what do you make
of our chances, Captain?

08:25.933 --> 08:29.100
Hmm... 70/30?

08:29.167 --> 08:31.067
Oh, 70... Which way?

08:39.467 --> 08:41.467
False alarm.
We're back in business.

08:41.533 --> 08:42.567
Phew!

08:47.300 --> 08:50.233
Thunderbird 3
to Shadow Alpha Base,
need a lift?

08:50.300 --> 08:51.633
SCOTT:
Negative, Thunderbird 3.

08:51.700 --> 08:54.133
Maintain your position
outside the strike zone.

08:54.200 --> 08:57.900
Captain Taylor thinks
we can take out the meteors
from our current location.

08:57.967 --> 09:00.633
And, for the moment,
it looks like the
only option we've got.

09:00.700 --> 09:02.067
Cheer up, kid.

09:02.100 --> 09:05.600
Your dad and I used to
get in scrapes like this
all the time.

09:05.667 --> 09:08.433
Didn't have this fancy setup
in the early days either.

09:08.500 --> 09:11.067
Back then we had to clear
the skies with flashlights

09:11.100 --> 09:13.067
and good old-fashioned
dynamite.

09:13.133 --> 09:15.233
Nowadays,
the laser response system

09:15.300 --> 09:17.567
automatically
tracks my movements.

09:17.633 --> 09:18.700
Pretty cool, huh?

09:18.767 --> 09:20.533
Saddle up, kid.

09:29.367 --> 09:31.400
Here we go, Alfie.

09:31.467 --> 09:33.200
Setting power to maximum.

09:34.267 --> 09:36.333
Targeting system initiated.

09:39.233 --> 09:43.767
Ready, aim, fire!

09:45.067 --> 09:46.067
(GASPS)

09:46.100 --> 09:48.567
(SCOTT GRUNTING)

09:52.167 --> 09:53.333
TAYLOR: That's it.

09:57.867 --> 09:59.433
(GRUNTING)

10:12.833 --> 10:16.233
(MUMBLING) See ya!

10:22.300 --> 10:24.800
-Incoming!
-Uh-oh! (GRUNTING)

10:27.733 --> 10:29.767
-Boom! He gone.
-That's it?

10:29.833 --> 10:33.133
That's it. Easy-peasy,
light and breezy.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.200
Yeah, but that was only
the first wave.

10:35.267 --> 10:36.800
The strikes
are gonna get worse.

10:36.867 --> 10:38.033
We can take 'em.

10:38.100 --> 10:39.833
Alfie's gotten me through
countless meteors,

10:39.900 --> 10:42.767
solar flares and lunar storms
in the past.

10:42.833 --> 10:44.100
I just can't give up on him.

10:44.167 --> 10:45.333
Look around you, Captain,

10:45.400 --> 10:47.467
don't you think Alfie's
given up on you?

10:47.533 --> 10:49.000
The station
was decommissioned.

10:49.067 --> 10:51.967
Why are you still trying
to keep it running?

10:52.033 --> 10:54.300
Because it's my home, Scott.

10:54.367 --> 10:55.967
Shadow Alpha One may be old,

10:56.033 --> 10:58.233
but that doesn't
make her worthless.

10:58.300 --> 10:59.767
This base is a part of me

10:59.833 --> 11:02.967
-and I'm not ready
to say goodbye just yet.
-(ALARM BLARING)

11:03.067 --> 11:04.767
SCOTT: Well, we may not
have a choice.

11:04.833 --> 11:06.067
The next wave is approaching.

11:06.100 --> 11:08.567
Stand by for round two!

11:08.633 --> 11:09.833
(POWER DIES)

11:09.900 --> 11:11.900
Not again,
you crusty old console!

11:11.967 --> 11:13.300
Did we just lose the ODDM?

11:13.367 --> 11:15.333
It's worse than that.
Take the control.

11:15.400 --> 11:18.067
We're looking at another
system-wide power failure.

11:18.067 --> 11:21.067
I've got to crawl back
into the mainframe and
patch up those relays.

11:21.133 --> 11:22.633
That wave is coming in
fast. (SIGHING)

11:22.700 --> 11:25.300
I can't move quickly enough
to blast every meteor.

11:25.367 --> 11:26.700
You don't have to,

11:26.767 --> 11:29.133
just concentrate on the ones
headed for the base.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.267
That doesn't sound
much easier.

11:36.833 --> 11:39.800
Base to Thunderbird 5, I could
sure use some help down here.

11:39.867 --> 11:43.167
Is there any way you can
show me only the meteors
that will hit the base?

11:43.233 --> 11:46.500
I've been programming
an algorithm to track
the Leonids' debris field.

11:46.567 --> 11:48.233
If it works,
we'll be able to predict

11:48.300 --> 11:50.233
where the meteors are
gonna land.

11:50.300 --> 11:51.767
I just need a signal
from the surface

11:51.833 --> 11:53.400
to help triangulate
the strike patterns.

11:53.467 --> 11:56.300
Try establishing
a link with the ODDM.

11:56.367 --> 11:58.300
That should give you
a fixed tracking point.

11:58.367 --> 12:00.700
-JOHN: Great idea, Captain.
-Don't mention it.

12:00.767 --> 12:02.400
Er, which brother
were you again?

12:02.467 --> 12:04.900
Uh, let's save
the introductions
till later, okay?

12:04.967 --> 12:05.967

-What did I tell you?

There's nothing this base
can't handle.

-Whoa! And the life support.

13:28.267 --> 13:29.867
Alfie's breaking apart!

13:29.933 --> 13:31.167
We've got to go now.

13:31.233 --> 13:33.267
(CRACKLING)

13:33.333 --> 13:34.800
I can't argue with that.

13:34.867 --> 13:38.533
The whole base is in danger
of decompression. Go, move.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.267
And unless you want
your lungs to burst,

13:40.333 --> 13:41.800
don't hold your breath.

13:44.200 --> 13:46.333
(WIND SURGING)

13:50.867 --> 13:53.267
JOHN: Thunderbird 5 to base.
Are you guys okay?

13:53.333 --> 13:56.067
Still kicking, Jim. Uh, John.

13:56.067 --> 13:58.900
But in a few minutes,
there won't be
any breathable air left.

13:58.967 --> 14:01.833
I'm sorry, Captain,
but it looks like Alfie's
had all he can take.

14:01.900 --> 14:05.467
TAYLOR: At least he's going
out in a blaze of glory.

14:05.533 --> 14:07.200
I knew I'd have to
retire one day,

14:07.267 --> 14:09.067
but I never thought
it would be like this.

14:09.100 --> 14:10.633
We need to evacuate,

14:10.700 --> 14:12.600
but I can't risk Thunderbird 3
flying into the strike zone

14:12.667 --> 14:14.333
while those meteors
are still falling.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.467
TAYLOR: There isn't time
to wait around, either.

14:16.533 --> 14:18.767
Our suits will be
out of oxygen soon.

14:18.833 --> 14:21.200
-We'll have to take the LT.
-The what?

14:21.267 --> 14:22.900
Lunar Transport.

14:22.967 --> 14:25.600
It's parked in a hangar
on the south side of the base.

14:25.667 --> 14:28.233
-If we reach it, we can
drive wherever we want.
-(THUDDING)

14:28.300 --> 14:30.267
Including a rendezvous
point with Alan

14:30.333 --> 14:31.533
outside the strike zone.

14:31.600 --> 14:32.733
Exactly!

14:32.800 --> 14:34.100
Which one is Alan?

14:34.167 --> 14:35.967
SCOTT: When this is over,
I'll write you a list.

14:36.067 --> 14:38.133
(BEEPING)

14:38.200 --> 14:40.533
SCOTT: Shadow Alpha Base
to Thunderbird 3,
are you there?

14:40.600 --> 14:43.300
ALAN: Finally.
I was starting to think
everyone forgot about me.

14:43.367 --> 14:45.233
SCOTT: John's transmitting
new landing coordinates.

14:45.300 --> 14:48.600
We need you ready to jet
the moment our transport
reaches your location.

14:48.667 --> 14:51.733
ALAN: F-A-B. One amazing
rescue coming up.

14:56.867 --> 14:58.133
-SCOTT: Thunderbird 5 to base.
-(THUDDING)

14:58.200 --> 14:59.767
Let me guess, more meteors?

14:59.833 --> 15:02.733
This field is bigger than
the last two waves combined.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.367
The strike zone's expanding.

15:04.433 --> 15:07.067
And you can expect
some tiny ones to arrive
before the main event.

15:07.100 --> 15:09.200
-(THUDDING)
-(PANTING)

15:09.267 --> 15:11.300
Do you call that
tiny, Thunderbird 5?

15:11.367 --> 15:13.500
Sounded like it came
from up ahead.

15:14.233 --> 15:15.767
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

15:15.833 --> 15:18.867
(SIGHING) Can we go through
a different tunnel?

15:18.933 --> 15:22.667
There are no more tunnels
and we wouldn't have time
if there were.

15:22.733 --> 15:24.467
There's only one thing
left to do.

15:25.200 --> 15:27.833
(GRUNTING)

15:27.900 --> 15:30.800
-We'll have to run for it.
-(GASPING) Wait for me!

15:38.667 --> 15:40.933
Hang on, Alan,
I'm tracking two life signs

15:41.067 --> 15:42.233
moving outside the base.

15:42.300 --> 15:44.267
Scott, you're both
extremely vulnerable

15:44.333 --> 15:46.200
to micro-meteor strikes
out there.

15:46.267 --> 15:48.167
A single hit could tear
your suit apart.

15:48.233 --> 15:49.767
SCOTT: Well, we'll try
not to get hit.

16:03.667 --> 16:06.300
TAYLOR: Look out!
(GRUNTING)

16:07.833 --> 16:09.067
(SCOTT SIGHS)

16:15.100 --> 16:16.967
-TAYLOR: Lose something?
-Thanks, Captain.

16:17.067 --> 16:18.100
Don't mention it.

16:18.167 --> 16:20.433
Your father did the same
for me once.

16:20.500 --> 16:22.300
Nice jetpack, by the way.

16:22.367 --> 16:24.067
You know,
I designed that model.

16:24.133 --> 16:26.400
SCOTT: Oh, really?
Does it come in blue?

16:32.933 --> 16:35.300
TAYLOR: There she is!

16:35.367 --> 16:38.100
The finest little buggy
this side of the Milky Way.

16:38.167 --> 16:40.067
Wow, that is... Big.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.267
Your dad always thought

16:41.333 --> 16:43.233
the flames were
a little too much.

16:43.300 --> 16:45.633
I like 'em.
I like 'em a lot.

16:45.700 --> 16:47.500
What's Thunderbird 3's
position, Thunderbird 5?

16:47.567 --> 16:50.367
JOHN: Alan's standing by
and the tracking system's
up and running.

16:50.433 --> 16:53.300
You've got just under a minute
before the final wave arrives.

16:53.367 --> 16:55.067
Thanks, Thunderbird 5.

16:55.800 --> 16:57.600
I'll drive. (GRUNTING)

16:58.067 --> 16:59.167
Hmm.

16:59.233 --> 17:00.467
Let's see.

17:00.533 --> 17:03.933
Huh. Uh, I don't know
what any of this does.

17:04.067 --> 17:07.067
You know what?
On second thought,
it's your ride, Captain.

17:07.133 --> 17:09.267
TAYLOR: I couldn't agree more.

17:17.133 --> 17:18.967
(HONKING)

17:19.067 --> 17:21.100
Ah, door won't open!

17:21.167 --> 17:22.567
Power must be out again.

17:22.633 --> 17:25.767
-Does this mean we're trapped?
-I never said that!

17:28.100 --> 17:29.533
(ENGINE REVVING)

17:32.233 --> 17:34.067
(TIRES SCREECHING)

17:36.733 --> 17:38.500
SCOTT: All right!

17:42.067 --> 17:45.800
Ha-hah! They just don't
make 'em like this anymore.

17:45.867 --> 17:47.433
I'm not surprised!

17:51.733 --> 17:54.433
Impact in 10 meters.
Get ready to turn left.

17:54.500 --> 17:56.867
A Tracy boy back in command.

17:56.933 --> 17:58.767
It's just like old times.

18:00.900 --> 18:02.933
-SCOTT: Turn right. Turn left.
-(TIRES SCREECH)

18:03.067 --> 18:04.300
TAYLOR:
Make up your mind, kid.

18:04.367 --> 18:06.900
Multiple fragments incoming.
There's nowhere to turn.

18:06.967 --> 18:08.633
Straight ahead it is, then.

18:13.933 --> 18:17.067
Whoaaa. Whoo!

18:19.800 --> 18:21.067
(LAUGHS)

18:22.333 --> 18:23.767
That never gets old.

18:23.833 --> 18:25.167
Captain, look out!

18:26.067 --> 18:27.733
(TIRES SCREECHING)

18:49.200 --> 18:52.333
Eh, it's too steep.
We need more power.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.733
-F-A-B.
-What does that
stand for again?

18:54.800 --> 18:57.100
-Time for one heck of a kick.
-(ENGINE REVVING)

19:01.067 --> 19:03.067
(GRUNTING)

19:04.067 --> 19:05.400
Now, Captain!

19:08.667 --> 19:10.767
(ENGINE VROOMING)

19:22.067 --> 19:23.333
TAYLOR: Whoa!

19:25.933 --> 19:27.800
All right! Yeah!

19:28.800 --> 19:30.367
There's our stop, Captain.

19:30.433 --> 19:32.067
Scott, the field is expanding.

19:32.067 --> 19:34.867
One of the meteors is headed
straight for Thunderbird 3.

19:34.933 --> 19:37.400
JOHN: Impact in 10, nine...

19:37.467 --> 19:39.367
SCOTT: It's gonna be
a close one!

19:39.433 --> 19:42.467
TAYLOR: Hold on, kid,
we got one more move left.

19:47.200 --> 19:50.600
-Activating ejector seat.
-SCOTT: Ejector?

19:50.667 --> 19:52.067
BOTH: Whoa!

20:06.700 --> 20:08.467
TAYLOR: So long, Alfie.

20:08.533 --> 20:10.433
Thanks for all the memories.

20:25.267 --> 20:28.367
So, there we were,
Lee Taylor and Jeff Tracy,

20:28.433 --> 20:31.200
facing down a solar flare
200 meters wide,

20:31.267 --> 20:33.533
when all of a sudden,
your father gets the idea

20:33.600 --> 20:36.233
to head for
a nearby asteroid belt!

20:36.300 --> 20:39.833
I said, "Jeff, what are you,
crazy? You're nuts!"

20:39.900 --> 20:41.300
He says,
"Don't worry about it,

20:41.367 --> 20:43.267
"we'll hide
behind the buckle."

20:43.333 --> 20:45.433
Every asteroid belt
has a buckle.

20:45.500 --> 20:46.767
A lot of people
don't know that.

20:46.833 --> 20:48.900
Could you tell me the part
about powering up

20:48.967 --> 20:50.967
with the flares' ionic energy?

20:51.033 --> 20:52.333
Max hasn't heard it before.

20:52.400 --> 20:54.867
Not tonight, Brains,
it's getting late.

20:54.933 --> 20:58.267
And you should all be resting
up for your next mission.

20:58.333 --> 21:00.267
But I haven't even told you
about my rescue yet.

21:00.333 --> 21:03.767
It can wait until morning.
Come on, off to bed. Shoo.

21:05.233 --> 21:07.567
I never got a chance
to thank you, Scott.

21:07.633 --> 21:09.267
Your father would've
been proud.

21:09.333 --> 21:11.067
Couldn't have done it
without you.

21:11.100 --> 21:12.867
Shadow Alpha One may be gone,

21:12.933 --> 21:15.633
but you'll always
have a place here at
International Rescue.

21:15.700 --> 21:16.667
Thanks for the offer,

21:16.733 --> 21:19.367
but I haven't had
a day off in 40 years.

21:19.433 --> 21:22.167
Maybe it's time
to slow down for a while.

21:22.233 --> 21:23.733
Get back to me in a month.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.133
Sure thing, Captain.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.533
Take all the time you need.

21:26.600 --> 21:29.100
Remind me again,
which one was Max?

21:29.167 --> 21:30.833
You didn't read the list,
did you?

21:30.900 --> 21:32.733
TAYLOR: (GROANS)
I'm not much of a reader.

21:32.800 --> 21:34.700
SCOTT: Yeah, it's five names
on a piece of paper.
