01:06.400 --> 01:07.594
Double dribble.

01:07.768 --> 01:09.463
Why, because I'm black?

01:09.637 --> 01:11.537
Yeah, that's what I thought.

01:33.327 --> 01:34.624
<i>Me?</i>

01:34.795 --> 01:36.387
Ten seconds left.
We need a basket.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.157
Play one. Play one.

01:41.135 --> 01:42.659
Kurt, Kurt, Kurt. Here.

01:42.836 --> 01:44.463
Get in.

01:46.373 --> 01:47.533
Bring it in!

01:47.708 --> 01:50.199
Bank's open, Lenny.

01:50.377 --> 01:51.708
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:51.879 --> 01:53.312
Yeah.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.175
Bank's open.

01:55.349 --> 01:57.681
His foot was on the line.

02:05.225 --> 02:08.661
First off, I'd like to thank
the Earnshaw family...

02:08.829 --> 02:12.424
...for lending us their beautiful lake
house to help us celebrate our victory.

02:12.599 --> 02:14.533
Yeah, the Ferdinando Five.

02:15.202 --> 02:17.864
They're dynamite.

02:18.038 --> 02:19.198
You're drunk, Dad.

02:19.373 --> 02:21.398
Yeah.

02:21.575 --> 02:25.773
Hey. We're here to celebrate
the kids' shots, not your shots.

02:27.548 --> 02:31.382
Anyway, I wanna talk about
what you kids did this afternoon.

02:31.552 --> 02:35.750
You know, you played the game
just like I always ask you to.

02:35.923 --> 02:38.619
You left everything you had
out there on that court.

02:39.193 --> 02:41.957
So that when the final buzzer
went off...

02:43.230 --> 02:44.595
...you were champions.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.892
Now, I want you
to promise me something.

02:47.067 --> 02:50.798
I want you to play life
just like you played that game today.

02:51.905 --> 02:54.635
So when that final buzzer of life
goes off...

02:58.445 --> 03:00.037
...you'll have no regrets.

03:00.547 --> 03:01.775
Here's to coach.

03:09.089 --> 03:12.217
You're my first champions.
My first champions.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.416
Stick together.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.328
<i>- Time to die.
- No.</i>

03:18.732 --> 03:20.324
<i>Murder.</i>

03:20.501 --> 03:24.096
I am the biggest agent in Hollywood
and you just pissed me off.

03:24.271 --> 03:26.603
And now I'll pull Brad Pitt
from your movie.

03:26.774 --> 03:30.210
I'll pull Julia Roberts from your movie.
I don't care, Sandy.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.504
That's right, you better back down.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.104
Thank you.

03:34.281 --> 03:36.681
Have a good Fourth of July.
All right, love you too.

03:36.850 --> 03:39.080
What's up, boys? Hey.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.350
Greggie, Keithie.

03:43.624 --> 03:46.684
You guys ever hear of a game called
Chutes and Ladders?

03:46.860 --> 03:47.918
Pretty awesome game.

03:48.095 --> 03:49.722
I used to play it when I was a kid.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.798
Okay, what it is,
is they give you a spinner.

03:52.966 --> 03:56.299
And you spin. If you land on a ladder,
you get to climb up the ladder.

03:56.470 --> 03:59.871
If you land on a chute, you slide down
the chute and start over again.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.975
Yeah, and what happens?
The winner gets a training bra?

04:03.143 --> 04:05.543
Yeah, Dad,
that game sounds like it sucks.

04:05.712 --> 04:07.703
I'm telling you,
this was the greatest game.

04:07.881 --> 04:09.439
Me and my buddies would play it.

04:09.616 --> 04:11.982
We'd go down in the basement,
drink hot chocolate.

04:12.152 --> 04:14.052
I wouldn't mind
a hot chocolate right now.

04:14.455 --> 04:16.514
Hey, Rita.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.214
Rita.

04:18.392 --> 04:20.882
Dude, you gotta text her.
She's doing laundry.

04:21.661 --> 04:24.324
Hey, Dad, we were at
the Spielbergs' house yesterday.

04:24.498 --> 04:27.524
They have a 150-inch TV.
Can we get one of those?

04:27.701 --> 04:30.261
<i>When you direct E. T.
I'll get you one of those.</i>

04:30.437 --> 04:33.372
<i>- Beg for mercy.
- What is the object here? I don't get it.</i>

04:33.540 --> 04:37.636
You're on a cruise ship and you chop
people's heads off with a chain saw?

04:37.811 --> 04:39.506
Oh, and you can drown them.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.511
Oh, you can drown them.
Now I get it.

04:42.316 --> 04:43.340
<i>Granny overboard.</i>

04:44.718 --> 04:46.652
Can somebody answer the phone?

04:47.120 --> 04:49.816
Maybe I should get some chamomile
for my throat too.

04:49.990 --> 04:52.515
Stop texting the nanny.
You know how gross that is...

04:52.693 --> 04:55.321
...for a kid to text his nanny?
Just go down the hallway.

04:55.496 --> 04:56.861
Why? You text everybody.

04:57.030 --> 05:01.023
I text people for my job so I can make
money to pay for your texting.

05:01.201 --> 05:04.864
- Okay, I got everything for you, boys.
- Who was that on the phone, Rita?

05:05.038 --> 05:08.064
I'm sorry, Mr. Feder, I don't know.
Becky answered.

05:08.242 --> 05:11.109
- Okay, okay. Thanks for making that.
- Oh, my God, Rita.

05:11.278 --> 05:13.906
This isn't Godiva. What are you,
trying to poison me?

05:14.715 --> 05:16.114
Good Lord, go back to texting.

05:16.283 --> 05:18.911
I don't ever wanna hear that
out loud again.

05:20.654 --> 05:23.020
What the heck's going on out here?

05:24.958 --> 05:26.585
Oh, my God.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.391
I didn't mean to. It was an accident.

05:30.564 --> 05:33.431
I don't care. Are you all right?
What the heck were you doing?

05:33.600 --> 05:35.693
I was trying to use the Navy.

05:35.869 --> 05:37.234
The Navy? What's the Navy?

05:37.404 --> 05:39.872
The Navy in the car
to ask it a question.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.702
You mean
the navigation system, idiot.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.707
- Keithie, relax.
- Some man called.

05:44.878 --> 05:48.143
He said your friend, Coach Buzzer,
went to heaven.

05:48.315 --> 05:51.512
I was trying to find heaven for you
on the Navy station...

05:51.685 --> 05:53.312
...so you could go visit him.

05:59.059 --> 06:00.754
Who's your friend, Dad?

06:02.195 --> 06:06.393
Coach Buzzer was someone
very special in Daddy's life.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.626
It's terrible.

06:08.802 --> 06:11.532
Okay, go drink some hot chocolate
with these guys.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.040
You sure you're okay?

06:16.343 --> 06:18.243
Okay, sweetie.

06:18.412 --> 06:19.811
You're splashing your brother.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.244
Eric, hon? It's your mom.

06:28.822 --> 06:31.848
Oh, my God. Eric.
Are you all right?

06:32.659 --> 06:34.024
Donna.

06:34.728 --> 06:37.822
Oh, my God, Bean.
Bean, stay on the duck.

06:37.998 --> 06:40.466
Stay on the duck.
What is happening?

06:40.634 --> 06:42.659
Oh, hon.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.027
Hello, Mommy.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.428
- Hey.
- Hey, Mom.

06:45.606 --> 06:46.630
Hi, Mom.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.934
Well, I'll see you there. All right.

06:49.109 --> 06:50.303
Hey, is something wrong?

06:50.477 --> 06:53.173
Yeah, it'll be all right.
I'll talk to you about it later.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.009
Hey, hey.

06:55.182 --> 06:57.047
I made the pumpkin risotto
that we saw...

06:57.217 --> 06:59.447
...on Rachael Ray's
"Seasons of Summer" special.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.986
- It's awful, Mom.
- It tastes like roadkill.

07:02.155 --> 07:04.851
Deanne, do you hear how they talk
to me? Do you hear how...?

07:05.025 --> 07:06.117
You gotta say something.

07:06.293 --> 07:09.285
All right, kids. Now, you know
your father works very hard...

07:09.463 --> 07:12.830
...at keeping this house clean
and putting meals on the table for us.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.467
Hello?

07:14.635 --> 07:16.569
Besides...

07:17.037 --> 07:20.302
...I brought us a pizza.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.334
You know what? Fine.

07:23.510 --> 07:25.444
Have your pizza. Have your pizza.

07:25.612 --> 07:26.806
You broke my heart.

07:26.980 --> 07:29.005
You broke my heart.

07:30.417 --> 07:33.352
Looks like
it's his time of the month again.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.954
God, that's rough, buddy.

07:37.991 --> 07:40.016
Who's making
the funeral arrangements?

07:40.193 --> 07:43.720
Oh, his niece?
She must be devastated.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.990
Hey, is she still hot, do you know?

07:46.166 --> 07:48.430
Don't make me lose my temper,
Marcus.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.771
What?

07:54.141 --> 07:57.577
Hey, if I don't make it
to the funeral...

07:57.811 --> 08:01.542
...tell the police it was Arlene
from Applebee's.

08:02.249 --> 08:04.046
No, thanks for calling me.

08:04.217 --> 08:05.946
And I'll see you there.

08:06.753 --> 08:08.345
Bye.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.649
The coach is dead.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.426
His funeral is this Friday.

08:19.566 --> 08:22.160
I don't think I can handle this alone.

08:22.469 --> 08:23.902
Can you come with me?

08:24.838 --> 08:26.499
Of course.

08:26.673 --> 08:29.699
I'll postpone my cataract surgery.

08:29.876 --> 08:32.106
You are my special lady.

08:32.611 --> 08:37.379
Now I'm gonna transport you
to a world of serene relaxation.

08:56.737 --> 08:58.796
Okay, guys,
let's try to act normal in there.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.564
What's wrong
with your sunglasses?

09:00.741 --> 09:02.834
I don't want any reason
for these guys to call me...

09:03.009 --> 09:04.840
Hollywood!

09:05.645 --> 09:08.739
- Hey. Look at that. Kurt McKenzie.
- Hey.

09:08.915 --> 09:11.509
- And the whole McKenzie clan.
- Come here, man.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.550
- Deanne, you look great.
- I do?

09:13.720 --> 09:16.348
My wife's over there.
Go and say hi. Children.

09:16.523 --> 09:18.582
I see that ass is still growing.

09:18.759 --> 09:21.125
Got a little Kardashian in there.

09:21.294 --> 09:25.890
Well, you've kind of turned into a little
Michael Vick thing, if he was bulimic.

09:26.933 --> 09:28.594
Hi, Roxanne.

09:28.769 --> 09:31.294
I don't know if you remember me.
I was at your wedding.

09:31.471 --> 09:34.736
I was the one that was table dancing
all night. Deanne McKenzie.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.102
Of course.

09:36.276 --> 09:38.801
- Deanne, hello.
- Hi, good to see you.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.344
Oh, my God, you're glowing.

09:40.547 --> 09:43.641
You look so beautiful
with your pregnancy.

09:44.651 --> 09:46.983
What the hell are you talking about?

09:50.857 --> 09:52.290
I'm just playing.

09:52.459 --> 09:55.860
Oh, my God. You should see
your face. You were like, "Huh?"

09:56.696 --> 09:58.789
Little Lenny Feder.

09:58.965 --> 10:00.364
Mama Ronzoni got big, huh?

10:00.567 --> 10:02.933
Look at this handsome hunk
of prosciutto.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.469
And such a big success.

10:05.639 --> 10:07.869
Come on, give Mama a kiss.

10:10.043 --> 10:12.273
Can I get a...?
Can I get a cheek at all?

10:12.445 --> 10:16.609
I got you, I got you. Poked in the eye
by the hat, but I'm all right.

10:17.417 --> 10:20.909
How about your son-in-law here,
I hear he's a house husband now.

10:21.087 --> 10:23.954
My daughter's gotta bust her hump
all day to pay the bills...

10:24.124 --> 10:26.251
...while dummy here stays home
and cleans.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.690
I don't know how you could
talk to me like that...

10:28.862 --> 10:31.831
...when you look like Idi Amin
with a propeller on your head.

10:31.998 --> 10:34.660
- That's nice that he could...
- Roxanne, this is my mother.

10:34.835 --> 10:39.363
Hello, Mama Ronzoni, I'm so pleased
to meet you. I'm Little Lenny's wife.

10:39.539 --> 10:43.373
What a spicy quesadilla
you got yourself, Lenny.

10:43.543 --> 10:45.602
Yeah, she tastes great.

10:46.346 --> 10:47.938
I bet.

10:50.951 --> 10:53.385
Didn't I tell you
to turn the phone off there, Greg?

10:53.553 --> 10:55.248
Yeah, but it's my massage therapist.

10:55.422 --> 10:57.686
What? No, no. No cell phones.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.519
No cell phones?
Then I'm out of here.

10:59.926 --> 11:01.018
Higgie.

11:01.194 --> 11:03.856
Who's ready to get their funeral on?

11:05.165 --> 11:06.928
I'm sorry, death makes me weird.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.567
What's up, McKenzie?

11:08.735 --> 11:10.965
You got those soft hands.
Still using Palmolive?

11:11.137 --> 11:12.399
Hey, what's up, Lenny?

11:12.572 --> 11:14.836
Buddy, I thought you were gonna start
working out.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.135
- What does that mean?
- You're fat.

11:17.310 --> 11:18.402
No. No.

11:18.578 --> 11:21.479
Hey, guys, this is good news.
I always wanted to represent you.

11:21.648 --> 11:23.479
You're the third Olsen twin?

11:23.650 --> 11:25.709
Keep it down.
Hey, so these are your kids?

11:26.653 --> 11:28.814
And who's that girl?
That's not a nanny, is it?

11:28.989 --> 11:33.085
No, no, this is a friend of ours
from China.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.160
Oh, yeah.
No, I've been on that website.

11:35.328 --> 11:36.352
No, no, no.

11:36.529 --> 11:41.125
Like an exchange student that...
My wife brought her into the house.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.667
Oh, your wife's into chicks.
Oh, that's nice.

11:43.837 --> 11:45.668
Hollywood. See, he always lucks out.

11:45.839 --> 11:48.137
- Just an exchange student.
- I always thought...

11:48.308 --> 11:49.741
Hey, now.

11:50.377 --> 11:53.744
Lamonsoff. Rolling up in a Caddy?

11:53.914 --> 11:54.938
That's how we do it.

11:55.115 --> 11:58.482
And you, you've grown up
on me, man. Are you a B-cup now?

12:00.754 --> 12:03.154
Hey, nice ears.
You get the NFL package on those?

12:04.724 --> 12:07.284
Nice Caddy.
You selling lawn furniture and crack?

12:07.460 --> 12:10.293
Come on, I'm the co-owner
of Branchville Lawn Furniture, man.

12:10.463 --> 12:11.760
I'm the boss now, baby.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.126
Oh, good for you, Eric.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.791
- Glad you brought your mother.
- Oh, that's a good one.

12:15.969 --> 12:19.336
It's like shaking hands with an Eagle.
I'll see you later.

12:21.808 --> 12:25.335
<i>Oh, my God. It's Captain Caring
of the SS Melodrama.</i>

12:25.512 --> 12:27.503
Oh, he's gonna play this one big.

12:27.681 --> 12:29.171
Cue "Hey. "

12:29.616 --> 12:30.708
Hey.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.317
Hey.

12:32.485 --> 12:35.045
- Hell of a circumstance, huh?
- I know, I know. It sucks.

12:35.221 --> 12:36.245
Great to see you.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.983
Well, the Buzzer's up there
coaching heaven's team now.

12:39.159 --> 12:43.186
- That's true.
- He's got Wilt, Pistol Pete, Dr. J.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.627
Yeah, Dr. J's alive still.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.397
- Well, those type of guys.
- Yeah, yeah.

12:48.568 --> 12:49.830
You look good, though, man.

12:50.003 --> 12:52.733
It's like if Elvis
was an Oompa Loompa...

12:52.906 --> 12:54.601
...he's right in front of me.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.834
Well, I don't make jokes at funerals
because it's disrespectful.

12:58.011 --> 13:00.946
But if that's part of
your healing process, I'm cool with it.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.479
That's nice. Thanks.

13:02.649 --> 13:04.583
Are you cool with a finger in you?

13:06.186 --> 13:08.814
Hey, Roxanne.

13:08.989 --> 13:12.288
Remember Rob,
the guy I always tell you about? Rob?

13:12.459 --> 13:13.619
Of course.

13:13.793 --> 13:17.251
The kid who didn't hit puberty
till he was 19, right?

13:18.198 --> 13:20.359
That was our secret.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.831
And this must be your mother.

13:23.336 --> 13:24.360
My wife.

13:25.071 --> 13:26.197
I'm sorry.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.500
Hi. I'm Gloria.

13:28.675 --> 13:32.008
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
Your design line is so beautiful.

13:32.712 --> 13:35.044
Oh, thank you, thank you.

13:35.215 --> 13:37.274
- And I love your scarves.
- Thank you.

13:38.051 --> 13:40.679
She'll be tying me up
with those later.

13:42.389 --> 13:44.414
He's not kidding.

13:46.126 --> 13:48.060
Oh, grody.

13:48.228 --> 13:51.686
Oh, those are long, long tongues.

13:54.234 --> 13:57.328
We'll see you in there.
See you in there.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.905
Hi, guys. Right over there? Yep.

14:02.075 --> 14:05.044
Sit right here, sit right here.
I'm gonna go say hi to Lenny.

14:05.211 --> 14:07.372
- No, honey.
- Oh, hi. Lenny.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.139
How you doing?

14:09.315 --> 14:11.545
I heard through a little bird...

14:11.718 --> 14:14.744
...that you guys rented
the Earnshaw lake house for us...

14:14.921 --> 14:16.115
...for the entire weekend.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.018
That's like a dream come true
for us.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.216
We had to rent it
for the whole weekend be...

14:20.393 --> 14:23.294
We don't get to stay the whole
weekend. We have to go to Milan.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.260
For Roxanne's fashion show.

14:25.432 --> 14:26.899
Oh, my God, that's a shame.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.297
Oh, but you're gonna have
so much fun in Milan.

14:29.469 --> 14:32.438
You know, J Lo and Marc Anthony
vacationed there last year.

14:32.605 --> 14:35.768
It's up the street from Lake Como,
where George Clooney has a villa.

14:35.942 --> 14:37.842
I read too many of those magazines.

14:38.011 --> 14:39.342
- No.
- Come on. I'm sorry.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.639
- He hates when I talk about this.
- We'll just...

14:41.815 --> 14:44.079
We are backing away.
Ashamed, right?

14:44.250 --> 14:47.014
Oh, and Tom Cruise
got married there too.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.351
- Thanks for letting me know.
- What?

14:49.522 --> 14:52.650
Well, I don't understand why you had
to rent it for a whole weekend.

14:52.826 --> 14:56.353
Because it's a holiday.
They won't rent it to you for one night.

14:56.529 --> 14:59.828
So your friends are partying all
weekend while you're stuck in Milan.

14:59.999 --> 15:01.296
- Yeah.
- That was nice of you.

15:01.468 --> 15:03.732
It was nice of us.
It's your money too, isn't it?

15:03.903 --> 15:06.770
Yeah, it's your money, it's his money,
it's my money.

15:06.973 --> 15:09.373
Let's put all our cash in a pile
and split it.

15:09.542 --> 15:12.067
That's a nice hat,
it brings out the death in the room.

15:12.245 --> 15:15.510
I'm sorry, I'm nervous.
And it's a funeral, I get weird.

15:18.751 --> 15:21.720
There he is, Joe Hollywood.

15:21.888 --> 15:23.981
Mr. Big Shot Agent.

15:24.157 --> 15:27.092
You think he represents
Hulk Hogan?

15:27.393 --> 15:29.293
No way.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.253
Then he ain't that big, is he?

15:33.032 --> 15:37.059
By the way, if anyone asks,
Rita is an exchange student.

15:40.907 --> 15:42.704
Andre.

15:43.376 --> 15:46.311
I think I just sat
on your adding machine.

15:46.913 --> 15:49.882
Now I know what happened
to the fish tank.

15:51.251 --> 15:53.481
Coach Robert "The Buzzer"
Ferdinando...

15:53.653 --> 15:55.587
...was a caretaker by profession.

15:55.755 --> 16:00.215
What a wonderful word to describe
his devotion to his fellow man.

16:00.393 --> 16:02.827
He truly took care.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.522
When Robert knew
that his time was short...

16:05.698 --> 16:08.223
...he told me there was
one specific man he wanted...

16:08.401 --> 16:10.665
...to say a few words
to memorialize him.

16:10.837 --> 16:14.238
So I'd like to ask Lenny Feder
to come up now.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.912
I'm sorry, I'm not prepared at all.

16:25.084 --> 16:27.484
I feel very honored...

16:28.454 --> 16:30.513
...that coach asked me
to do this, but...

16:31.925 --> 16:36.658
I also feel terrible because
I haven't seen the coach in so long.

16:36.829 --> 16:40.287
And he always wanted me to come
to town and see him...

16:40.466 --> 16:44.300
...and I got caught up
in what I've been doing and I regret it.

16:45.071 --> 16:48.131
I understand that the St. Mark's team
of 1978...

16:48.308 --> 16:52.244
...was the only championship team
that the coach ever had...

16:53.479 --> 16:55.947
...and that's very impressive,
I gotta say...

16:56.115 --> 16:58.811
...judging from the talent
we had to offer.

16:58.985 --> 17:00.816
I mean, believe it or not...

17:00.987 --> 17:05.481
...Robbie and Marcus were actually
shorter back in 1978.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.551
But those guys had a skill
you never mastered.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.923
They knew how to pass the ball.

17:11.798 --> 17:16.064
Looks like somebody has to learn how
to pass the Kentucky Fried Chicken.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.102
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

17:19.271 --> 17:22.502
We're saying goodbye to a big part
of our lives. All of us.

17:22.675 --> 17:26.805
You affected everybody in this room.

17:28.348 --> 17:31.511
And I hope we get
to live our lives like you.

17:32.151 --> 17:37.987
Have no regrets
when life's final buzzer sounds.

17:38.858 --> 17:41.190
So let's all bow our heads in silence.

17:54.774 --> 17:57.675
They should have just ended it
right after you.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.505
This is insanity.

17:59.679 --> 18:00.907
Yeah.

18:01.281 --> 18:04.842
Five bucks it takes him down
on one knee.

18:05.251 --> 18:06.775
You're on.

18:14.294 --> 18:15.955
<i>Stop it.</i>

18:53.099 --> 18:54.259
Grow up, will you?

18:54.434 --> 18:55.833
Oh, look at him now.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.537
Don't get so mad there, Robbie.

19:01.441 --> 19:04.342
So how we feeling about Rob's girl?
We're happy for him, or...?

19:04.510 --> 19:07.240
Oh, my God. The St. Pauli Grandma?
She seems all right.

19:07.413 --> 19:08.778
She's pretty.

19:08.948 --> 19:10.813
You know,
in a "me in a wig" sort of way.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.382
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

19:14.587 --> 19:18.079
When Ben Franklin was flying that kite
and it had the key on it...

19:18.257 --> 19:20.191
...that was to her apartment.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.225
Oh, that was good, man.

19:22.395 --> 19:26.764
You know, but I gotta say,
he seems like he's in love, you know?

19:26.933 --> 19:28.958
He was in love
with the first three wives.

19:29.135 --> 19:30.864
The Cheater, the Beater
and the Eater.

19:31.037 --> 19:34.473
You know, his problem is he's always
so overly in love so quick, you know?

19:34.640 --> 19:37.768
And then one day he snaps
and then it gets ugly in a hurry.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.309
Coffee, Mr. Feder?

19:39.479 --> 19:41.106
No, no, no. I'm good, I'm good.

19:41.280 --> 19:44.875
I mean, thank you. That's cool of you
to voluntarily wanna give me coffee.

19:45.051 --> 19:49.181
Just, you drink it, you know, while
you're studying inside the church.

19:49.789 --> 19:51.381
But you texted me you want coffee.

19:51.557 --> 19:54.390
I texted you that I wanted you
to drink the coffee and study.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.960
So study your books in the church.

19:57.130 --> 19:59.428
Go ahead. All right, Rita.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.328
Fast food? You guys eat the fast...?

20:06.305 --> 20:07.636
Mommy, I want some milk.

20:07.807 --> 20:12.437
Oh, sure, angel. You come here.
I'll give you a little something.

20:14.380 --> 20:16.371
Slow down, honey.
Not such big gulps.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.278
You're gonna get a tummy ache.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.749
- Your son is so cute.
- Yeah.

20:22.922 --> 20:23.946
How old is he?

20:24.991 --> 20:27.824
Oh, he's 48 months.

20:27.994 --> 20:29.461
That's 4.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.054
Yeah.

20:31.230 --> 20:34.324
We meant to stop last year,
but he likes it so much...

20:34.500 --> 20:36.798
...and we don't like to say no.

20:36.969 --> 20:38.664
Hey, sweetheart?

20:38.838 --> 20:40.863
Could you use a fork, please?

20:41.040 --> 20:42.166
No.

20:42.341 --> 20:46.539
No, no, no!

20:46.712 --> 20:48.771
Looks like she didn't get the memo.

21:10.303 --> 21:14.467
- Hey. Let me get that spot.
- Hey, gotta respect the Caddy.

21:14.974 --> 21:16.999
It's nice you drove
your piggy bank here.

21:17.176 --> 21:18.643
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:18.811 --> 21:20.073
Hey. Hi, Gloria.

21:20.246 --> 21:21.304
- Look at this.
- Come on.

21:21.481 --> 21:22.539
Yeah.

21:22.715 --> 21:24.842
Hey, Rob's car
is an Oompa Loompa too.

21:25.017 --> 21:28.316
- Okay, watch the edge.
- It's cute. It'll do for one night.

21:28.488 --> 21:29.887
Yeah? You can handle it?

21:32.058 --> 21:33.650
Daddy, what is that machine doing?

21:33.826 --> 21:35.726
It's getting rid of the moths, honey.

21:35.895 --> 21:37.362
Where's it taking them?

21:37.530 --> 21:39.088
- Hell.
- Don't say that, Higgins.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.731
I'm sorry. Not hell, Mexico.

21:40.900 --> 21:44.768
No, it's giving them electricity...

21:44.937 --> 21:47.929
...so the moths fall asleep
electrically.

21:48.107 --> 21:49.540
It's electrocuting them?

21:49.709 --> 21:51.540
- No, no, no.
- But, Daddy, they're dying.

21:51.711 --> 21:53.076
- It's killing them?
- No.

21:54.013 --> 21:55.071
Daddy, no.

21:55.248 --> 21:56.408
No, no, it's not.

21:56.582 --> 21:58.345
Okay? Let me adjust it.

21:58.518 --> 22:01.851
Look, they're all all right,
I promise you.

22:02.021 --> 22:04.285
See? Look at this guy.

22:04.690 --> 22:05.918
He's still sleeping.

22:06.092 --> 22:08.026
It's dead, Dad.

22:08.728 --> 22:10.252
A porch swing.

22:10.429 --> 22:12.795
I know what I'm doing this weekend.

22:15.902 --> 22:17.392
Now he's dead.

22:17.570 --> 22:20.562
Welcome back to 1978, everybody.
The lake house.

22:21.140 --> 22:23.040
Nothing's changed,
it's unbelievable.

22:23.209 --> 22:25.143
I don't remember this big.

22:25.311 --> 22:27.939
This is my kitchen.
This is it, right now.

22:28.114 --> 22:29.945
Oh, please, enough with the kitchen.

22:30.116 --> 22:31.242
Why you so mean?

22:31.417 --> 22:32.748
We could've done this.

22:32.919 --> 22:35.251
- An organ.
- Oh, my God, look at this kitchen.

22:35.421 --> 22:37.889
- That's enough, already.
- Could you at least humor me?

22:38.057 --> 22:39.888
Is this like
an Outward Bound thing?

22:40.059 --> 22:41.959
<i>I mean, it's like an episode of Lost.</i>

22:43.062 --> 22:44.893
Hon, you might not
wanna bang on that.

22:45.064 --> 22:46.793
But I like playing it like this.

22:46.966 --> 22:48.433
Okay. Okay.

22:48.601 --> 22:50.660
So listen, guys,
who's getting what room?

22:50.836 --> 22:53.304
Actually, I made a map
of who gets which room.

22:53.472 --> 22:56.270
I took the liberty of reserving
the room with the waterbed...

22:56.442 --> 22:58.171
...for Gloria and myself.

22:58.945 --> 23:02.312
You're gonna do
the backstroke tonight.

23:02.481 --> 23:04.506
I wanna go swimming
with you guys tonight.

23:04.684 --> 23:07.949
Oh, honey, we're not really going
swimming. What I meant was...

23:08.120 --> 23:10.520
That's okay. She doesn't
need to know what you mean.

23:10.690 --> 23:13.989
- I don't even know what you mean.
- Oh, I know what she meant.

23:14.527 --> 23:16.495
Anyway, let's get back
to the room picking.

23:16.662 --> 23:18.857
Rob, would you like
to take us on a tour?

23:19.031 --> 23:21.932
I'd love to show you a tour.
Gloria was just trying to be cool.

23:22.101 --> 23:23.693
I need someplace near a bathroom.

23:23.869 --> 23:26.167
Why does the grandma
get to go swimming and I don't?

23:26.339 --> 23:27.966
Let's go, let's go.

23:28.841 --> 23:30.775
Okay, here's the big daddy.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.171
The master bedroom.

23:32.345 --> 23:35.678
You know what? Lenny should
have that. Lenny should have that.

23:35.848 --> 23:37.042
- Oh, no, no, no.
- I agree.

23:37.216 --> 23:39.309
Honey. Honey.
Come on, let the kids have it.

23:39.485 --> 23:43.182
It's a fun time for the kids to be
together and they can do kids' things.

23:43.356 --> 23:45.551
Come on, go share it.
Share the master bedroom.

23:45.725 --> 23:47.158
Kids win.

23:47.326 --> 23:48.623
Yeah. Yeah. Don't you think?

23:50.029 --> 23:51.053
Yeah, okay.

23:51.230 --> 23:52.925
- Cool.
- Cool.

23:55.534 --> 23:56.967
Hey, Dad.

23:57.136 --> 24:00.333
What's the big box attached
to the back of the TV?

24:00.506 --> 24:02.497
That's the rest of the TV.

24:02.675 --> 24:05.166
They didn't always have
flat screens there, sport.

24:05.344 --> 24:09.246
Wow, that is some
Stone Age shiznit.

24:09.415 --> 24:12.407
- Yeah, that's wack.
- I need a room with heat.

24:12.585 --> 24:15.076
It's summer.
It's like 95 degrees in here.

24:15.655 --> 24:17.213
There he goes again.

24:17.390 --> 24:18.914
I got bunions.

24:19.091 --> 24:22.151
You know, I actually have a poultice
I make, using maize and herbs.

24:22.328 --> 24:24.228
Just say corn.
Maize is corn, everybody.

24:24.397 --> 24:26.922
Yeah, he says maize
because it sounds more mystical.

24:27.099 --> 24:29.727
Well, I like the way he said it.
"Maize. "

24:29.902 --> 24:31.494
- "Maize. "
- "Maize. "

24:31.671 --> 24:33.536
- "Maize. "
- "Maize. "

24:33.706 --> 24:36.800
- It's fantastic, okay?
- It's a-maize-ing.

24:37.677 --> 24:40.407
I just spread it on cloth
and I moisten and heat it...

24:40.579 --> 24:43.173
...and then I apply it directly
to the affected area.

24:43.349 --> 24:49.288
Okay. Well, my affected area
is pretty big.

24:49.455 --> 24:50.922
Oh, no.

24:52.058 --> 24:55.550
Mama, I didn't know
the Elephant Man lived in your shoe.

24:55.728 --> 24:58.288
How in the world's anybody supposed
to get some sleep...

24:58.464 --> 25:01.365
...knowing they under the same roof as
Toe-be Bryant over here?

25:02.868 --> 25:04.704
You're stepping over the line,
woman.

25:10.276 --> 25:13.404
So, what's with that Labradoodle?
It sounds like Stephen Hawking.

25:13.579 --> 25:16.241
Curly, he had
his vocal cords clipped.

25:16.415 --> 25:18.315
A neighbor filed a complaint...

25:18.517 --> 25:22.578
...so it was either clip the cords
or put Curly down.

25:24.790 --> 25:25.916
Wrong choice.

25:26.559 --> 25:28.754
Come on, he's part of the family,
you know?

25:28.928 --> 25:32.557
Imagine when a burglar comes over
and hears that. He must run in terror.

25:32.732 --> 25:34.791
"Wow, what's that turkey
doing in the house?"

25:35.935 --> 25:37.926
By the way, Lamonsoff, your son.

25:38.104 --> 25:40.629
What's with the boob thing?
Isn't the kid a little old?

25:40.806 --> 25:43.070
He'll be rubbing her boob
with his beard soon.

25:43.242 --> 25:46.905
He's gonna get a milk mustache on a
real mustache. That won't look right.

25:47.079 --> 25:49.138
That kid, when he's 10, on his bike...

25:49.315 --> 25:52.307
...the mom's gonna be in the basket,
he's gonna be like:

25:55.321 --> 25:57.346
- Come on.
- Okay, wait, I got this one.

25:57.523 --> 25:58.922
<i>Chain saw pedicure, 50 points.</i>

25:59.091 --> 26:01.559
Why are they inside right now,
anyways?

26:01.727 --> 26:04.195
Why would they not come out here
and enjoy the lake...

26:04.363 --> 26:05.830
...or do something in the woods?

26:05.998 --> 26:08.364
There wasn't a time of day
that I wasn't outside.

26:08.567 --> 26:11.434
You know, we weren't.
We were always... We were never in.

26:11.604 --> 26:13.333
<i>All heads on deck!</i>

26:13.506 --> 26:15.371
Look, there's blood
squirting everywhere!

26:15.541 --> 26:18.135
- I can't take it anymore.
- Chop his arms off.

26:18.310 --> 26:20.141
Oh, he's being a dad. Look at this.

26:21.313 --> 26:23.611
Dad. Don't, Dad. My high score.

26:23.783 --> 26:28.880
That's it. No more video games.
No more cell phones. No more texting.

26:29.054 --> 26:32.387
Just from now on, while we're here,
stay outside and play.

26:32.558 --> 26:33.855
What are we supposed to do?

26:34.026 --> 26:38.360
Just play like normal kids.
Come on, move it. Where's Becky?

26:38.531 --> 26:41.333
Let's go. Let me show you
how the Pilgrims used to hang.

26:41.400 --> 26:45.803
When we were kids, your dad used to
talk us into doing the craziest stuff.

26:45.971 --> 26:46.995
That's right.

26:47.173 --> 26:50.233
Yeah, I remember one time,
we got our shower curtains...

26:50.409 --> 26:53.537
...put them in shopping carts and went
shopping cart sailing.

26:53.712 --> 26:54.838
Wait, how did you steer?

26:55.014 --> 26:56.982
- Well, we didn't.
- How'd you stop?

26:57.149 --> 26:59.709
You just smashed into something.
That was the fun part.

26:59.885 --> 27:01.819
We used to shoot bottle rockets
at each other.

27:01.987 --> 27:04.512
You go for the guy's face
because you wanna blind him.

27:04.690 --> 27:06.351
Okay, no, that's a little much, pal.

27:06.525 --> 27:08.891
No. No, I know. Kids, don't do that.

27:09.061 --> 27:11.928
You know what, erase, reboot.

27:12.097 --> 27:15.760
Okay. Look, look.
Make a tree fort. I'll get you started.

27:15.935 --> 27:17.869
Rob lived in one of those for a year.

27:18.037 --> 27:19.629
Why?

27:19.805 --> 27:21.830
My dad took away my roller skates.

27:22.441 --> 27:24.341
Vietnam flashback.

27:25.344 --> 27:27.437
Wait a minute. Are you kidding me?

27:27.646 --> 27:29.375
- What?
- What?

27:30.149 --> 27:31.207
Nice.

27:31.383 --> 27:33.510
Rope on a tree, baby.
You know what that means.

27:33.686 --> 27:35.017
We get to hang ourselves?

27:35.187 --> 27:38.884
You see a rope and a lake and that
doesn't make you wanna go nuts?

27:39.058 --> 27:40.525
It makes me... You know what?

27:40.693 --> 27:42.718
You know what, let me show them.

27:42.895 --> 27:44.021
- Yeah.
- Yeah, baby.

27:44.196 --> 27:45.595
Dude, get up on the top rock.

27:45.764 --> 27:48.289
- Yeah, you're right.
- You gotta back it up, back it up.

27:48.467 --> 27:49.559
Go, baby.

27:49.735 --> 27:52.067
The class is in session.

27:52.238 --> 27:54.229
Who wants to see a double flip?

27:55.341 --> 27:56.365
Too high.

27:56.542 --> 27:58.476
- Now drop.
- This was a mistake.

27:59.278 --> 28:00.802
I can't let go, I'm too scared.

28:08.954 --> 28:11.115
That was awesome.

28:11.290 --> 28:14.384
Oh, God. Oh, God, my leg's snapped.

28:14.560 --> 28:16.892
Oh, my God, the bone's sticking out.
I need help.

28:17.363 --> 28:20.799
It's a stick. I got you.

28:22.368 --> 28:23.460
Very good.

28:23.636 --> 28:25.900
Daddy, that bird is hurt.

28:27.840 --> 28:30.604
Oh, my God. I'll go get a shoebox.

28:31.477 --> 28:33.308
Here you go.

28:33.479 --> 28:35.879
Hey, did you really land
on that bird, man?

28:36.048 --> 28:37.072
I'm not sure.

28:37.249 --> 28:41.151
I did hear a chirp and a crunch-like
noise, but that could've been anything.

28:41.720 --> 28:42.922
Okay.

28:46.425 --> 28:48.154
Keith. Sit down. Sit down.

28:48.327 --> 28:49.658
Dad, I wanna sit next to you.

28:49.828 --> 28:52.592
Daddy's gonna be down here with
his friends first and then...

28:52.765 --> 28:56.633
Lenny, remember we used to come
here late night after we got wasted?

28:58.437 --> 28:59.495
What's "wasted"?

29:00.005 --> 29:01.267
Nice one, Higgie.

29:01.440 --> 29:04.136
"Wasted. " kids...

29:04.310 --> 29:07.006
...is something that happens...

29:07.179 --> 29:09.204
...when you have a hankering
for ice cream.

29:09.381 --> 29:11.076
- I wanna get wasted.
- I wanna get wasted.

29:11.250 --> 29:12.615
I wanna get wasted every day.

29:12.785 --> 29:14.776
I wanna get chocolate wasted.

29:14.954 --> 29:17.286
No, you don't need to get wasted,
it's okay.

29:17.456 --> 29:20.016
All right, you know what,
let me make this easy.

29:20.192 --> 29:23.525
Seventeen burgers
and 17 fries, okay?

29:23.696 --> 29:27.496
And that'll be just for me.
What are you guys having?

29:28.400 --> 29:29.424
Lamonsoff.

29:29.601 --> 29:30.727
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:30.903 --> 29:32.894
That's for everybody.
Just put it on that.

29:33.072 --> 29:36.337
- Oh, you don't have to do that.
- I am not gonna have any hamburgers.

29:36.508 --> 29:39.409
I'll take some meat loaf,
some calzones...

29:39.578 --> 29:42.479
...but put the marinara sauce
on the side.

29:42.648 --> 29:45.549
With corn, either on the cob
or whatever you got.

29:45.718 --> 29:48.050
- Are you going to the electric chair?
- What?

29:48.220 --> 29:50.188
No, he was just kidding, Henry VIII.

29:51.924 --> 29:55.155
She's eating for two:
her and Toe-bo Cop.

29:55.694 --> 29:58.754
But, Mama, they do have bunion rings
if you want some.

29:58.931 --> 30:00.330
That was good, Lenny.

30:00.499 --> 30:01.761
How about some drinks?

30:01.934 --> 30:04.368
I said I'm paying,
so take it easy with that, okay?

30:04.536 --> 30:07.403
I'm kidding, everybody. I'm kidding.
We can drink all we want.

30:07.573 --> 30:09.438
I'll start it off.
I'm gonna have a Coke.

30:09.608 --> 30:13.908
And I know Donna, she's gonna want
a Sprite, correct, sweetie? And...

30:14.847 --> 30:16.405
Bean's good with milk, obviously.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.908
I want cookies.

30:19.084 --> 30:20.415
Cookies and MILF.

30:20.586 --> 30:22.451
MILF? Oh, Higgins,
thank you so much.

30:22.621 --> 30:25.454
Take it easy, all right?
Hey, tuck it away, sweetie.

30:25.624 --> 30:27.615
And I'll take a flat water. Voss.

30:28.227 --> 30:29.251
What?

30:29.428 --> 30:31.794
You know, Voss.
Or Fiji, if you don't have Voss.

30:31.964 --> 30:34.023
Yeah, you know,
anything you got's good.

30:34.199 --> 30:35.461
We have out of the faucet.

30:35.634 --> 30:36.931
Like, from a hose?

30:37.102 --> 30:38.126
Tap water.

30:38.303 --> 30:39.531
What country's that from?

30:39.705 --> 30:43.197
Oh, my God. Just get the water. We're
done talking about water. Tap water.

30:43.375 --> 30:44.808
I go get the Voss from the b...

30:44.977 --> 30:48.708
You just sit down, Rita. Just study
a menu. The big test is coming.

30:56.722 --> 30:57.916
I'm sorry, what now?

30:58.090 --> 31:00.558
He says they have the best burger
in town here.

31:00.959 --> 31:04.156
Really? Since when did you learn
to speak Chinese?

31:04.329 --> 31:06.889
It's just something I picked up
watching a cooking show.

31:07.066 --> 31:10.797
That's great. Maybe you should focus
a little less on the talking...

31:10.969 --> 31:12.664
...and a little more on the cooking.

31:12.838 --> 31:14.499
Burn.

31:14.673 --> 31:16.800
You got told.

31:17.743 --> 31:18.801
You got toe.

31:20.479 --> 31:21.571
He comes back.

31:22.181 --> 31:24.945
Mommy, can I have some
of her milk?

31:25.451 --> 31:27.146
There he is.

31:27.352 --> 31:28.649
Joe Hollywood.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.754
Who's that? Dickie Bailey?

31:31.924 --> 31:33.084
Oh, my God.

31:33.258 --> 31:36.091
Hey, long time no see.
How you doing, man?

31:36.261 --> 31:38.525
You know, that game
had some bad calls.

31:38.931 --> 31:41.593
Now, what game are we talking about?
The game?

31:41.767 --> 31:44.361
What, when we were kids
30 years ago, that game?

31:44.536 --> 31:46.367
That last shot?

31:46.538 --> 31:49.268
Your foot was on the line.
Shouldn't have counted.

31:49.441 --> 31:52.672
I don't know. I don't remember it
quite like that.

31:52.845 --> 31:56.008
You got the rest
of the Fugly Five over there, huh?

31:56.281 --> 31:58.249
Yes. Yes. They are.
The boys are here.

31:58.417 --> 31:59.441
Boys?

31:59.618 --> 32:02.746
They don't look like they can make it
up and down the court anymore.

32:02.921 --> 32:05.116
What about you?
You put on a few pounds?

32:05.290 --> 32:06.814
From when I was 12?

32:06.992 --> 32:08.926
Yes, I think so.

32:09.094 --> 32:11.494
You don't know how to come at me,
do you?

32:11.663 --> 32:12.687
Rematch. I dare you.

32:15.601 --> 32:18.866
In basketball? You don't look like
you're in the greatest shape either.

32:19.037 --> 32:22.302
I could see having
a getting-off-the-couch contest, but...

32:22.474 --> 32:23.566
Anytime, anywhere.

32:23.742 --> 32:26.142
I was just kidding.
I really don't wanna do that.

32:26.311 --> 32:30.304
Next time you come to town, I'll have
plenty of that Boss water for your kid.

32:30.883 --> 32:33.044
- All right.
- Wouldn't want him to go thirsty.

32:33.218 --> 32:37.678
All right, well, just for the record,
it's Voss water, by the way, with a V.

32:39.424 --> 32:40.482
Okay.

32:43.228 --> 32:46.356
Gonna be an emotional day tomorrow,
spreading the Buzzer's ashes.

32:46.532 --> 32:47.556
Oh, my God.

32:47.733 --> 32:50.964
The coach requested that we
scatter his remains on Mclntyre Island.

32:51.136 --> 32:52.763
I got a beautiful ceremony planned.

32:52.938 --> 32:55.736
Lenny, you gonna be able to do that?
What time do you leave?

32:56.175 --> 32:58.643
- What are you talking about?
- What do you mean, leave?

32:58.810 --> 33:02.371
I forgot to tell you, fellas.
We gotta take off in the morning.

33:02.548 --> 33:04.482
- You're leaving?
- You can't leave.

33:04.650 --> 33:07.619
- We got the ceremony tomorrow.
- Lenny's just playing, everybody.

33:07.786 --> 33:08.878
No, he's not.

33:09.054 --> 33:10.214
Are you joking?

33:10.389 --> 33:14.257
I wanna be there. I mean, we all wanna
be there. We gotta go to Milan.

33:14.426 --> 33:17.054
Milan, what? Italy? What's in Milan?

33:17.629 --> 33:20.257
It's pretty cool.
Roxanne's got her fall line coming out.

33:20.432 --> 33:23.890
- Fashion week.
- Three nights at the Four Seasons.

33:24.069 --> 33:25.730
Eggs Benedict by the pool...

33:25.904 --> 33:28.031
...PlayStation 3 in every room...

33:28.207 --> 33:30.767
...and they show boobies
on Italian TV.

33:32.110 --> 33:33.600
I'm going to Italy.

33:34.880 --> 33:38.475
No, we all... I didn't tell you guys,
we're probably gonna go to Italy as a...

33:38.650 --> 33:40.117
Thanks for ruining the surprise.

33:40.619 --> 33:42.712
Lenny, it's not gonna be the same
without you.

33:42.888 --> 33:43.912
Yeah, come on.

33:44.089 --> 33:47.217
Roxanne was cool enough to let us
come tonight. This is a big deal.

33:47.392 --> 33:49.986
Can't Roxanne go without you
and you can meet her there?

33:50.162 --> 33:54.326
No, we are a team, me and my lady,
and we do everything together.

33:54.499 --> 33:58.060
Last year, we had to skip
Becky's school play for Milan.

33:58.637 --> 34:00.400
Roxanne.

34:00.772 --> 34:02.205
Roxanne.

34:04.109 --> 34:06.737
I thought we were
gonna get wasted.

34:07.446 --> 34:10.005
Sweetie. What was I supposed to do,
lie to them?

34:10.181 --> 34:13.117
It's not what you said.
It's how you said it.

34:13.284 --> 34:17.722
I am not some insensitive
work-crazy dragon lady.

34:17.889 --> 34:20.652
And I'm not gonna let you
depict me as one.

34:20.826 --> 34:22.817
We are skipping the dinner
in Milan...

34:23.027 --> 34:24.393
...spreading the ashes...

34:24.563 --> 34:26.963
...and we're leaving first thing
Sunday morning.

34:35.107 --> 34:39.407
Lamonsoff, it's 5 in the morning.
Can you kill the dog now?

34:39.645 --> 34:40.976
Thinking about it.

34:41.746 --> 34:44.773
Go ahead.
Birdy coming through, everybody.

34:44.949 --> 34:46.007
Hey, morning.

34:46.184 --> 34:48.175
Morning.
Take it right over to the table.

34:48.353 --> 34:50.321
How we doing?
Something stinks in here.

34:50.489 --> 34:52.821
Gloria and I are making breakfast
for everybody.

34:52.991 --> 34:56.984
Using a dehydrator, which never
cooks anything above 115 degrees.

34:57.162 --> 34:59.187
- Those are pancakes?
- Ocean pancakes.

34:59.364 --> 35:02.527
They're gray. They look like you
cut them off an elephant's legs.

35:02.701 --> 35:04.999
- I'm not eating that.
- It's good for you.

35:05.170 --> 35:07.035
- What is this?
- "What is this?"

35:07.205 --> 35:08.399
A scab?

35:08.573 --> 35:09.835
It's dehydrated banana.

35:10.008 --> 35:12.704
What happened to a normal banana?
Peel a banana and eat it.

35:12.878 --> 35:15.574
The kids'll love it. It's fun, man.
It doesn't go bad.

35:15.747 --> 35:17.647
- You slice it thin...
- I see what you do.

35:17.816 --> 35:19.477
Maybe you're right. This is good.

35:19.651 --> 35:21.710
- Is that what it's meant for?
- You could.

35:21.887 --> 35:25.687
Well, I'd rather be hit by
dehydrated fruit than processed...

35:25.857 --> 35:26.881
Processed food.

35:27.059 --> 35:29.926
- I'm just kidding around.
- You think you can just slap people.

35:30.095 --> 35:33.087
I don't think that. Don't say that.
Come on.

35:33.265 --> 35:34.527
Morning.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.827
Honey, how is the birdy?

35:38.370 --> 35:40.770
Those are
the Christian Louboutin shoes.

35:40.939 --> 35:42.065
I know I'm overdressed.

35:42.240 --> 35:46.267
But, sorry, I packed for Milan,
not the lake.

35:47.346 --> 35:48.711
Made from acorns.

35:48.880 --> 35:52.213
So, dude, I'm not eating any of this.
You got any normal food? Cereal?

35:52.384 --> 35:55.182
Would you like me to make you
egg-white frittata, Mr. Feder?

35:56.922 --> 35:59.550
I mean, is that what you're doing
in science class now?

36:00.025 --> 36:01.549
Making frittatas?

36:01.727 --> 36:04.594
No. We're okay. You can go
practice that in your room, though.

36:04.763 --> 36:07.027
I know you got the big test coming.

36:08.266 --> 36:10.632
You know, honey,
I think you're overwhelming Lenny.

36:10.802 --> 36:13.270
Here, I got a present for you.

36:13.872 --> 36:15.134
Bacon.

36:15.307 --> 36:17.138
- Knock yourself out.
- Bacon.

36:17.609 --> 36:18.633
She gets it.

36:18.810 --> 36:21.210
She gets it. She gets it.
Hey, she gets it.

36:21.380 --> 36:23.610
Thank God she gets it.

36:23.782 --> 36:25.249
All right, so...

36:25.417 --> 36:27.044
Hey, what are you doing?

36:27.786 --> 36:28.810
Cooking the bacon.

36:28.987 --> 36:32.445
Not in here. That's dead animal flesh.
It's not going near the vegan food.

36:32.624 --> 36:33.716
Murderer.

36:33.892 --> 36:36.383
Fine. What do I do with it?
Oh, I know.

36:36.561 --> 36:38.222
I'm sorry, buddy. I'm sorry.

36:42.200 --> 36:45.192
Curly. Shame on you.

36:45.370 --> 36:46.860
That crazy dog.

36:47.038 --> 36:50.235
Must have got into some of my leftover
pasta fasul.

36:50.409 --> 36:53.071
Yeah, Mama, I'm sure
that's exactly what happened.

36:53.245 --> 36:54.405
It did.

36:54.579 --> 36:56.171
We should get a dog.

36:56.882 --> 36:59.680
We should get a water buffalo.

37:01.219 --> 37:02.516
Higgins, what are you doing?

37:02.687 --> 37:06.521
I don't wear pants at my house, I'm not
wearing them in your house. Sorry.

37:07.759 --> 37:09.961
That was a man's ass?

37:10.028 --> 37:11.723
All right.

37:15.367 --> 37:17.164
Yeah.

37:18.270 --> 37:20.431
Let's see this. Look at that.

37:26.812 --> 37:28.279
That's it, buddy.

37:28.447 --> 37:30.074
Okay, throw the rock.

37:31.049 --> 37:32.482
Skim it.

37:33.418 --> 37:34.680
Throw it at a tree.

37:35.120 --> 37:37.111
Throw it at the lake.

37:38.023 --> 37:39.957
Throw it at your brother.

37:40.125 --> 37:41.353
Hit your head with it.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.487
Just do something.

37:46.364 --> 37:47.831
Come on.

37:48.700 --> 37:52.192
What are you doing dressed like that?
You hanging out with Jiminy Cricket?

37:52.604 --> 37:54.834
We were supposed to be going
to Milan, remember?

37:55.006 --> 37:56.371
That's what I packed for.

37:56.541 --> 37:57.803
Just cut those into shorts.

37:57.976 --> 38:00.171
- We'll play some hoop later.
- Pass, dude.

38:00.345 --> 38:02.745
You don't want revenge
for the time I whupped you?

38:02.914 --> 38:04.381
That was four years ago, homey.

38:04.549 --> 38:08.246
All I want is to fly to Milan
and have some fresh-made gelato.

38:09.955 --> 38:12.150
What would your father have done
on that one?

38:12.324 --> 38:15.088
That one would've been a backhand
to the side of the head...

38:15.260 --> 38:17.057
...and possible bleeding from the ear.

38:17.229 --> 38:20.687
My father would've thrown me down
the stairs for using the word gelato.

38:21.433 --> 38:24.095
- You got the new Foreman.
- Yeah.

38:24.269 --> 38:27.329
Hilliard was trying to make me
some tofu Grape-Nuts in there.

38:27.506 --> 38:28.564
Try it out.

38:28.740 --> 38:30.867
- You cleaned this?
- Yeah, I cleaned this thing.

38:31.042 --> 38:32.134
- Take it.
- Thanks a lot.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.278
By the way,
Mclntyre Island ain't close.

38:34.446 --> 38:36.880
Eat as much as you can,
we got a big row ahead of us.

38:38.216 --> 38:39.911
You didn't clean that well.

38:40.819 --> 38:43.754
Come on, man.
What are you doing to me? Seriously.

38:43.922 --> 38:47.255
You don't want your breath to smell
like your grandmother's closet?

38:58.703 --> 39:00.330
Slow down for Robbie, guys.

39:00.505 --> 39:01.733
You're gonna lap me.

39:02.674 --> 39:05.370
Beautiful. You gotta respect
going to Mclntyre Island.

39:05.544 --> 39:07.205
Haven't done that since we're 12.

39:07.379 --> 39:09.040
Got my first boob there.

39:09.214 --> 39:11.478
- I know. Tracy Thornhill.
- Tracy Thorn...

39:11.650 --> 39:13.277
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

39:13.451 --> 39:14.941
A little flat, but I was a fan.

39:15.120 --> 39:17.953
All right, Higgins. Is that all you
think about is chicks?

39:18.123 --> 39:20.523
- We got daughters.
- That's all you guys think about.

39:20.692 --> 39:23.923
- Difference is, I can do something.
- Not true. All right, that's true.

39:24.095 --> 39:26.120
You wanna know
what I fantasize about?

39:26.298 --> 39:27.322
Candy bars.

39:27.499 --> 39:28.523
Candy bars?

39:28.700 --> 39:32.067
No, I had a bad blood sugar test at
my last checkup and Sally cut me off.

39:32.237 --> 39:34.228
You're a grown man,
how do you deal with that?

39:34.406 --> 39:37.000
Oh, I got my own hidden stash,
I'm not stupid.

39:37.175 --> 39:38.437
Seriously, I got it all.

39:38.610 --> 39:40.840
I got Reese's, Butterfingers,
3 Musketeers.

39:41.012 --> 39:44.914
I hide them under my clothes
in the bottom of the hamper.

39:45.083 --> 39:48.610
It's great because the smell in my
sweat socks mask the chocolate smell.

39:48.787 --> 39:51.517
And the looks of your underwear
masks the chocolate stains.

39:51.690 --> 39:54.250
Hey, hey, hey, hang on, guys.
I gotta make a sissy.

39:54.426 --> 39:56.087
- No, no, no.
- I gotta make a sissy.

39:56.261 --> 39:57.626
You made three already.

39:58.029 --> 39:59.997
It must be just oozing out at this point.

40:00.165 --> 40:01.826
Shut up, I'm trying to concentrate.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.093
It's taking a piss, not the SATs.

40:10.775 --> 40:15.007
Are you peeing or is a diesel truck
turning off? What the hell is that?

40:15.747 --> 40:17.476
Listen to hamper bottom.

40:17.649 --> 40:20.015
I think he's sending a message
in Morse code.

40:20.285 --> 40:22.150
Getting old. Stop.

40:22.320 --> 40:24.117
Can't pee. Stop.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.014
Reeks like asparagus. Stop.

40:26.191 --> 40:28.284
Even though I didn't even have any.
Stop.

40:28.460 --> 40:30.860
The good news is these girls
are gonna say hi to it.

40:31.896 --> 40:33.887
- What's up, ladies?
- Hey, girls.

40:34.799 --> 40:37.359
- That is so gross-looking.
- Did you see that?

40:37.535 --> 40:41.437
- They don't all look like that, ladies.
- You gave that thing 300 pounds...

40:41.606 --> 40:42.698
Come on.

40:47.712 --> 40:49.543
Sick mix tape you made, Robbie.

40:49.714 --> 40:53.411
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey, guys, I brought something too.

40:53.585 --> 40:55.678
- Get out of here.
- It's the net, yeah.

40:55.854 --> 40:57.253
Championship game.

40:57.422 --> 40:59.890
- Let me see that.
- I thought the coach should have it.

41:00.058 --> 41:02.492
Robbie, you gotta put this
on the urn, buddy.

41:02.661 --> 41:03.719
That's cool.

41:03.928 --> 41:06.453
- "Your foot was on the line. "
- Bailey.

41:06.631 --> 41:10.226
What do you think the coach would've
said if he heard that trash-talking?

41:10.402 --> 41:12.267
He'd kick our ass
for not kicking his.

41:12.437 --> 41:14.200
- Yeah.
- Or we do it the old-school way.

41:14.372 --> 41:16.738
- Have Eric beat his ass for us.
- I know, we should.

41:16.908 --> 41:20.844
No, no, no. I got about eight seconds
of fighting, total, left in my life.

41:21.012 --> 41:22.980
And I'm saving that in case
I get mugged...

41:23.148 --> 41:26.049
...or, you know, someone cuts
in front of me at Burger King.

41:26.217 --> 41:29.516
- That's my hamper bottom.
- We can't delay it anymore, guys.

41:29.688 --> 41:32.782
- He just bit his chicken. All right.
- Are we going? Okay.

41:32.957 --> 41:34.322
Let's do it.

41:34.492 --> 41:37.461
You know, I think the coach
is here with us.

41:38.096 --> 41:41.588
I think he's proud to be here with us
in ash form.

41:41.766 --> 41:44.496
Right here on this island,
where we hid from our parents...

41:44.669 --> 41:47.137
...and where we're hiding
from our wives and children.

41:47.305 --> 41:48.363
Yes, we are.

41:51.910 --> 41:53.070
Goodbye to you...

41:54.012 --> 41:55.240
...friend...

41:58.016 --> 41:59.881
...wise-advice giver...

42:06.024 --> 42:07.992
...buzzer-noise maker.

42:14.866 --> 42:16.299
Rob, come on.

42:16.468 --> 42:18.868
I really messed up my marriages.

42:19.204 --> 42:20.432
All of them.

42:20.605 --> 42:22.300
It was my fault, man.

42:22.540 --> 42:24.064
I just couldn't hang on.

42:24.709 --> 42:27.075
You know, my own daughters...

42:27.512 --> 42:29.776
...I don't even hardly know them.

42:30.181 --> 42:32.411
- The Buzzer would be ashamed of me.
- No.

42:32.584 --> 42:33.608
Come on, now.

42:33.785 --> 42:36.185
You got time to patch things up
with your daughters.

42:36.354 --> 42:38.584
You just call them
when you get back.

42:38.757 --> 42:42.284
Actually, they're gonna be here
in about 20 minutes.

42:43.828 --> 42:45.193
Wait, what?

42:45.363 --> 42:46.796
I can use a piece of chicken.

42:47.332 --> 42:49.596
No, not with those hands.
Coach hands. All right.

42:49.768 --> 42:50.962
Finish the bucket.

42:51.136 --> 42:54.503
Actually, I'm still gonna eat it.
This is pretty sick, but I'm hungry.

43:01.813 --> 43:03.303
Lamonsoff.

43:04.415 --> 43:06.849
Go, old bucket. Drop it.

43:23.067 --> 43:25.433
Piece of crap car.

43:26.237 --> 43:27.704
What?

43:28.473 --> 43:29.531
Hey, Dad.

43:30.675 --> 43:32.199
Me?

43:34.579 --> 43:35.910
What?

43:36.080 --> 43:38.207
- How do you get that...
- Hey.

43:38.383 --> 43:39.577
...from that?

43:40.084 --> 43:42.712
Ninety-five percent of that's gotta be
from the mother.

43:42.887 --> 43:44.479
And I am lowballing.

43:44.656 --> 43:45.884
Hey, Jasmine.

43:46.090 --> 43:47.717
How is that possible?

43:47.892 --> 43:49.985
Oh, no. The Elvis hairs
are going up her nose.

43:50.161 --> 43:51.719
She doesn't know what to do.

43:51.896 --> 43:52.920
That's sweet.

43:53.097 --> 43:54.394
Is this your car?

43:54.966 --> 43:57.332
My old man lent me this turd.

43:57.836 --> 44:00.896
Because he doesn't care if I
break down in the middle of nowhere...

44:01.072 --> 44:02.699
...and get eaten by a bear.

44:02.874 --> 44:04.171
Your old man?

44:04.342 --> 44:07.106
Yeah, my boyfriend.
Forty-seven years old.

44:07.278 --> 44:09.439
You know,
I wish I liked guys my own age...

44:09.614 --> 44:12.674
...but I'm just chasing the dad
that ran out on me.

44:25.763 --> 44:27.663
Hoochie mama.

44:28.867 --> 44:30.528
What does that mean?

44:31.002 --> 44:33.596
I don't know, but it feels right.

44:40.578 --> 44:42.637
I hope that car never gets fixed.

44:43.848 --> 44:44.974
I don't think it will.

44:45.149 --> 44:46.548
I took the spark plugs out.

44:46.718 --> 44:47.912
Nice.

44:50.488 --> 44:53.685
We're all looking at the same time.
Let's at least take shifts.

44:53.858 --> 44:55.621
Lamonsoff,
you and me look at the tree.

44:55.793 --> 44:58.353
McKenzie, we're gonna look
at her butt for a little bit.

44:58.529 --> 45:00.360
All right. Good plan.

45:00.698 --> 45:02.825
And, shift.

45:05.436 --> 45:06.562
Shift.

45:07.772 --> 45:09.706
Shift.

45:10.608 --> 45:11.870
Shift.

45:12.343 --> 45:13.640
And shift.

45:15.079 --> 45:16.376
What are we doing?

45:16.748 --> 45:18.978
Wait, are we all looking at the tree
right now?

45:19.183 --> 45:20.946
Yeah. Let's go back to the ass.

45:21.352 --> 45:23.786
Hey, Jasmine. This is Gloria.

45:23.955 --> 45:26.014
Gloria, this is Jasmine.

45:26.190 --> 45:27.657
Hi.

45:29.027 --> 45:31.996
Oh, look, here comes Grandma Gloria
to the rescue.

45:32.163 --> 45:34.188
Let me take a look.

45:35.867 --> 45:37.425
Oh, honey.

45:37.602 --> 45:40.366
You've blown your gasket.

45:58.389 --> 46:00.482
No good.

46:01.859 --> 46:04.062
That was rough.

46:04.128 --> 46:06.653
If you guys thought seeing them
at the car was gross...

46:06.831 --> 46:08.958
...you should have heard
that waterbed action.

46:09.133 --> 46:11.658
Sounded like two grizzlies
fighting over a salmon.

46:11.836 --> 46:14.634
- There was a lot happening.
- At least he's getting something.

46:14.806 --> 46:17.536
I've been shut out since Deanne
found out she was pregnant.

46:17.709 --> 46:20.337
- That'll happen.
- You have sex when they're pregnant?

46:20.511 --> 46:22.376
- Does that hurt the baby?
- McKenzie can.

46:22.547 --> 46:24.538
The baby thinks
he's getting a Tootsie Roll.

46:24.749 --> 46:27.047
- That's good.
- Snickers. Snickers.

46:27.218 --> 46:28.879
A little bigger. A little bigger.

46:29.053 --> 46:32.716
I got lucky on Saint Paddy's Day,
but she was half-asleep.

46:32.890 --> 46:34.790
And by half-asleep,
I mean she was asleep.

46:34.959 --> 46:36.426
Yeah, she was out. Yeah.

46:36.594 --> 46:37.856
You're allowed to do that.

46:38.029 --> 46:39.690
She'd rather not be awake.

46:39.864 --> 46:43.595
- Hey, how'd it go with the daughter?
- Awkward.

46:45.003 --> 46:48.871
I guess the first 20 years of a kid's
life is more important than I realized.

46:49.140 --> 46:51.335
Yeah. It's always the kids who pay.

46:51.509 --> 46:52.874
Kids pay.

46:53.044 --> 46:54.409
- They pay.
- They pay.

46:54.579 --> 46:56.843
- They always pay.
- But they pay with maize.

46:57.015 --> 46:58.539
Was good hanging with you guys.

46:58.716 --> 47:01.150
- No, no, no. We're catching up.
- Come on, man.

47:01.319 --> 47:04.413
I'm glad my family turmoil can
provide entertainment for you guys.

47:04.589 --> 47:07.524
Let's cheer him up. How did we cheer
Robbie up in the old days?

47:07.692 --> 47:09.523
A little arrow roulette?

47:09.761 --> 47:11.592
- Arrow roulette.
- Did we really do that?

47:11.763 --> 47:13.697
Single stupidest thing we ever did.

47:13.865 --> 47:14.889
It was the craziest.

47:15.066 --> 47:16.431
- Moronic.
- Asinine.

47:17.935 --> 47:20.961
- All right, fellas.
- I can't believe we're doing this.

47:21.139 --> 47:24.108
How do we always let Lenny
talk us into the stupidest stuff?

47:24.275 --> 47:27.039
Remember, whoever stays
in the circle the longest wins.

47:27.211 --> 47:29.543
- I don't like that part.
- Whoever stays longest.

47:29.714 --> 47:32.808
Okay, guys, here we go.
And a one. And a two...

47:32.984 --> 47:34.417
Why are we doing this?

47:35.253 --> 47:36.686
Go.

47:37.755 --> 47:39.052
Hold.

47:40.425 --> 47:42.086
- I don't see it.
- Where is it?

47:42.260 --> 47:43.818
- I lost it in the sun.
- I lose.

48:19.864 --> 48:22.799
Curly.

48:42.787 --> 48:44.482
I am the champion.

48:44.655 --> 48:47.283
I beat all you pansies.

48:56.300 --> 48:59.167
Go, go. Come on, come on, come on.
Hurry up.

48:59.337 --> 49:01.328
Oh, you're moving it.
You're shaking it.

49:01.506 --> 49:02.564
My hammy.

49:02.740 --> 49:05.300
You complaining about your hammy?
I got an arrow in my foot.

49:05.476 --> 49:06.966
- Easy, easy.
- Stay calm.

49:07.145 --> 49:08.339
What's going on?

49:08.513 --> 49:11.175
- Rob got attacked by an Indian.
- Yeah, but he got away.

49:11.349 --> 49:13.180
- What?
- He got attacked by an Indian?

49:13.351 --> 49:16.718
- Daddy, what happened?
- Amber. I'm glad you got here.

49:16.888 --> 49:19.322
This is my daughter Amber,
everybody.

49:20.591 --> 49:21.819
You got another one?

49:21.993 --> 49:24.484
- Dude, high five.
- No, no high five, my wife's coming.

49:25.930 --> 49:28.865
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- God, you made me look at this.

49:29.500 --> 49:30.660
This is killing me.

49:30.835 --> 49:33.167
Bridget, come down here.
Daddy's hurt.

49:33.337 --> 49:35.202
- You got another one?
- Yeah.

49:35.706 --> 49:37.537
Hey.

49:37.708 --> 49:39.300
- Oh, okay.
- "Hey. "

49:39.477 --> 49:40.808
DNA.

49:40.978 --> 49:42.946
- Now I get it.
- Rob's her mom and dad.

49:43.114 --> 49:44.206
Now that makes sense.

49:44.382 --> 49:47.215
Shut up. Foot, arrow, why?

49:47.385 --> 49:50.354
- I think we gotta pull it through.
- Oh, let me do it.

49:51.422 --> 49:52.912
It was my idea, I said it first.

49:53.090 --> 49:56.526
- Don't you hog it. Don't you touch him.
- Nobody touch him.

49:57.195 --> 49:58.719
We're gonna be all right here.

49:58.896 --> 50:01.694
All we need is a poultice with some
maize that will draw...

50:01.866 --> 50:03.299
Oh, shut up.

50:03.467 --> 50:05.458
That poultice shit doesn't work.

50:05.636 --> 50:07.297
It never worked. Are you insane?

50:07.471 --> 50:09.598
Get some alcohol on this bitch.

50:09.774 --> 50:11.366
You should know plenty about that.

50:11.542 --> 50:13.237
You were born
during the Prohibition.

50:14.412 --> 50:15.504
And there's the snap.

50:15.680 --> 50:17.875
That was bigger
than I thought it was gonna be.

50:18.049 --> 50:19.584
Snap, crackle and pop.

50:21.052 --> 50:23.316
Abnormal origin. Pancreas.
Abnormal...

50:23.487 --> 50:26.081
Such a mess. Such a mess.
I can not...

50:28.092 --> 50:32.153
Excuse me? Princess Rita?
Are you gonna help me?

50:32.330 --> 50:35.299
No, Mr. Feder said
that I must study for the big final.

50:35.466 --> 50:36.490
What final?

50:36.667 --> 50:39.397
You tell me.
He just keep handing me books.

50:39.570 --> 50:42.130
Never mind. Did you pack
the adapters for Italy?

50:42.306 --> 50:43.739
Yes, I did in L. A.

50:43.908 --> 50:45.239
Great. Just wipe your hands.

50:45.409 --> 50:48.901
I need you to organize all these papers
in here very neatly, okay?

50:49.080 --> 50:50.809
They cannot be ruined.

50:51.282 --> 50:52.681
Hello.

50:52.950 --> 50:55.475
Hi, this is Roxanne Feder.
I just wanna make sure...

50:55.653 --> 50:58.781
Mommy. Mommy.
It came out. It came out.

50:58.956 --> 51:00.685
Hold on,
I'm on the phone, okay?

51:00.858 --> 51:02.951
My tooth. It fell out.

51:03.127 --> 51:04.219
That's great, honey.

51:04.395 --> 51:07.364
Put it under the pillow
and I'll put a dollar in there later.

51:07.531 --> 51:08.589
What?

51:08.766 --> 51:12.497
Becky, I'm on the phone.
I'll put the dollar under...

51:14.138 --> 51:16.106
Why would you?

51:18.476 --> 51:21.274
There's no Tooth Fairy?

51:31.255 --> 51:33.655
I can't believe I just did that.

51:35.626 --> 51:38.356
Oh, Lenny, you should have seen
her little face.

51:38.963 --> 51:40.555
I don't know what's wrong with me.

51:40.731 --> 51:44.167
I mean, I try so hard
and I can't seem to get anything right.

51:44.335 --> 51:46.496
You made a mistake.
Parents make mistakes.

51:46.671 --> 51:50.163
Remember the time I told Greg that
babies come from mommies' poop...

51:50.341 --> 51:52.935
...and he kept looking in the toilet
for a baby brother?

51:53.110 --> 51:55.874
- That's not funny.
- I'm just saying.

51:56.047 --> 51:58.345
Can you hear me now? Okay.

51:58.516 --> 51:59.983
I just feel...

52:00.151 --> 52:02.142
What about now?
Now can you hear me?

52:02.320 --> 52:04.413
I feel like I ruined her childhood.

52:05.623 --> 52:07.250
She was gonna find out eventually.

52:07.425 --> 52:10.087
Eventually, but not today.

52:11.262 --> 52:13.059
Can you hear me now?
This is so cool.

52:13.230 --> 52:16.893
- Are you there?
- Hey, didn't I say no cell phones?

52:17.668 --> 52:19.363
I thought we had a deal.

52:19.537 --> 52:21.402
- What?
- What's up, Dad?

52:22.373 --> 52:23.601
Are those cup phones?

52:23.774 --> 52:25.765
Yeah, Charlotte taught us.
Cool, huh?

52:25.943 --> 52:27.035
Hey, check out Becky's.

52:27.211 --> 52:29.771
Look, Dad. I have cup waiting.

52:29.947 --> 52:32.279
I gotta call you back,
I'm on with SpongeBob.

52:36.253 --> 52:37.777
Was that a turkey?

52:37.955 --> 52:39.217
Yo, Andre, can you hear me?

52:39.390 --> 52:40.880
Crystal clear. Can you hear me?

52:41.058 --> 52:42.548
Oh, yeah.

52:49.133 --> 52:52.466
So the best thing about these
is we can leave a cup in the shower...

52:52.636 --> 52:54.934
...and listen to Jasmine
clean herself tomorrow.

52:55.106 --> 52:56.232
- What?
- Oh, my God!

52:56.407 --> 52:57.999
May I borrow this?

52:58.175 --> 52:59.233
Attention, children.

52:59.677 --> 53:02.202
There's been a request
from the phone company.

53:02.380 --> 53:07.249
Would you please install cup phones
in every adult bedroom right away?

53:07.418 --> 53:09.818
Thank you. All right. Go.
Move it, move it, move it.

53:09.987 --> 53:11.477
I said, move it. Move it.

53:33.677 --> 53:37.044
Yes, I have always been
the Tooth Fairy.

53:37.348 --> 53:40.909
No, Bean's mommy
is the Tooth Fairy for his family.

53:41.085 --> 53:43.246
I just cover our family.

53:44.221 --> 53:47.247
No, do not tell Bean, okay?

53:47.425 --> 53:51.885
Becky, I love you
so, so, so much, okay?

53:52.229 --> 53:54.493
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

53:54.665 --> 53:57.600
- Okay, you're costing me a fortune.
- No, you hang up first.

53:57.768 --> 54:00.066
Let's go.
This is gonna be a high cup bill.

54:00.237 --> 54:03.206
It's nice to put maize
on your arrow wound.

54:03.374 --> 54:05.638
What the hell is that?
Is that Gloria laughing?

54:05.843 --> 54:08.676
She's still here
after he had a snap on her like that?

54:08.846 --> 54:12.509
- She forgave him right away.
- You are my special lady.

54:12.683 --> 54:15.049
And you are my one-footed
maize-covered lover.

54:15.486 --> 54:17.386
Okay, come on,
we gotta go to sleep.

54:17.555 --> 54:20.456
We're going to Milan tomorrow, right?
A long flight.

54:20.624 --> 54:22.251
Let's get our rest.

54:25.095 --> 54:27.859
Somebody kill that turkey.

54:38.175 --> 54:40.541
Is that getting me horny?

54:41.378 --> 54:42.606
Yes.

54:42.980 --> 54:45.915
You promise you'll still feed her
after we leave?

54:46.083 --> 54:47.516
I promise.

54:47.685 --> 54:49.312
Mommy, that's my milk.

54:49.487 --> 54:52.354
Bean, we have to learn how to share,
even with birds.

54:52.523 --> 54:55.014
But he's going to drink you dry.

55:01.432 --> 55:02.797
This is good.

55:11.942 --> 55:13.876
I got it three times.

55:14.044 --> 55:16.205
Donna, you wanna try?

55:16.814 --> 55:18.873
Sure. But I stink at sports.

55:19.049 --> 55:20.744
That's all right. Here.

55:20.918 --> 55:23.045
- Hold it like this.
- Like this?

55:23.220 --> 55:26.678
Get down low and throw it,
and let the rock do the magic.

55:28.158 --> 55:29.420
- Nice.
- Oh, I skipped it.

55:29.927 --> 55:32.521
- Good job, Donna.
- Bravo.

55:32.696 --> 55:34.254
Do you know how to skip rocks?

55:34.431 --> 55:36.592
Are you kidding me?
I am the best at this.

55:37.535 --> 55:40.299
Give me that. Now, watch, now.

55:45.042 --> 55:47.067
Oh, my God, baby, are you okay?

55:47.244 --> 55:50.941
Yeah, Mom, I'm just glad to see you
having some fun.

55:51.882 --> 55:53.975
I'll take your luggage to the car,
Mr. Feder.

55:54.151 --> 55:56.051
That's not my luggage,
that's textbooks.

55:56.220 --> 55:58.347
That's nice of you to take your
own stuff down.

55:58.522 --> 55:59.546
You're okay. Come on.

55:59.723 --> 56:01.748
Come on, man.
Already? You're leaving?

56:01.926 --> 56:03.086
Yes, I gotta go.

56:03.260 --> 56:05.251
Do you need any help getting
to the airport?

56:05.429 --> 56:06.589
We got a little problem.

56:06.764 --> 56:07.992
What? What happened?

56:08.165 --> 56:10.599
I forgot how to skip a rock.

56:10.834 --> 56:14.463
Now, I think it's gonna take
a couple of days to figure it out.

56:14.738 --> 56:15.898
So...

56:16.340 --> 56:18.103
...I think we better stay.

56:18.275 --> 56:19.435
Are you kidding me?

56:19.610 --> 56:22.238
For reals, Mom? We're not leaving?

56:22.413 --> 56:26.406
I don't need to see a bunch of starving
models walking around in my clothes.

56:26.584 --> 56:29.417
Yeah, why would you wanna see
models when you can see this?

56:30.588 --> 56:34.115
See? You couldn't get that in Milan.

56:35.659 --> 56:36.683
You.

56:36.860 --> 56:38.088
You.

56:38.662 --> 56:40.459
What do you wanna do today?
Anything.

56:40.631 --> 56:42.098
I don't know. You tell me.

56:42.266 --> 56:45.929
What was your favorite thing to do
when you were 12 and it was sunny?

56:47.104 --> 56:48.196
Well, I can't do that.

56:49.807 --> 56:52.469
Maybe go to a water park.

56:52.643 --> 56:53.871
What are we waiting for?

56:54.044 --> 56:56.069
- Seriously?
- Let's load up the car, people.

56:56.246 --> 56:57.270
Are you kidding me?

56:57.448 --> 57:00.884
- I'm not taking my shirt off.
- I'm not taking my shirt off either.

57:04.555 --> 57:05.886
You're wasting it.

57:06.357 --> 57:07.381
Sorry.

57:09.126 --> 57:10.616
It's all right.

57:11.528 --> 57:13.263
It's actually not that bad.

57:20.270 --> 57:24.468
- Ladies' day.
- All right? You're in charge.

57:28.278 --> 57:29.768
I have to go number two.

57:29.947 --> 57:31.414
Okay, hang on, son.

57:31.682 --> 57:32.706
Hey, Dad.

57:32.883 --> 57:34.714
Hey. Where you guys been?

57:34.885 --> 57:38.514
Well, we didn't bring our swimsuits, so
Marcus went to take us to buy some.

57:41.525 --> 57:43.652
We got them at a store
called Naughty and Nice.

57:43.827 --> 57:45.852
Marcus said
it was the only one open.

57:46.030 --> 57:49.659
The only place open?
For bathing suits? In the summer?

57:50.501 --> 57:53.368
We got my bathing suit
at Stop and Shop.

57:53.971 --> 57:56.064
Now, that's... I like that one.

57:56.240 --> 57:57.935
Let's hit the water slide.

57:58.108 --> 57:59.439
Water slide.

58:07.051 --> 58:08.245
What a beautiful day.

58:08.419 --> 58:11.115
- God. It's a girls' day.
- I know.

58:11.288 --> 58:13.415
It is hot.

58:13.590 --> 58:14.852
Oh, boy.

58:15.025 --> 58:17.459
- Are we really doing bathing suits?
- God, it's hot.

58:17.628 --> 58:20.188
Come on, girls. We don't know
these people. Who cares?

58:20.364 --> 58:24.323
You're right, who cares? I've been
working all summer on this six-pack.

58:24.501 --> 58:25.525
All right.

58:25.703 --> 58:27.295
How do you feel about that?

58:27.471 --> 58:31.532
- Baby got front.
- Go, D. Go, D.

58:31.709 --> 58:33.700
Come on, Sally, it's your turn.
Take it off.

58:33.877 --> 58:35.845
Oh, no.
I have a bit of a chill, actually.

58:36.013 --> 58:37.037
Gloria, how about you?

58:37.214 --> 58:40.081
I don't own a bathing suit.
But I like to go nude.

58:40.250 --> 58:42.741
- No, no, no.
- There's children here.

58:42.920 --> 58:46.048
Hey, somebody likes what he sees.

59:02.973 --> 59:05.100
- Daddy, this line's not even moving.
- I know.

59:05.275 --> 59:08.608
- I know.
- I want Mommy's milk.

59:08.779 --> 59:10.269
I know you do, son, but...

59:10.447 --> 59:13.007
He wants mommy's milk.
Give him some mommy's milk.

59:13.183 --> 59:14.912
Mommy's milk! Mommy's milk!

59:15.085 --> 59:16.518
No. No. Damn it.

59:16.687 --> 59:18.177
No more Mommy's milk, okay?

59:18.355 --> 59:20.619
You want milk,
you're drinking regular milk.

59:20.791 --> 59:22.850
- Here, kid.
- Hey.

59:23.026 --> 59:26.257
Don't give me any guff right now.
Here's a buck. Run along. Run along.

59:26.430 --> 59:28.261
Here.
Drink the milk out of the carton.

59:28.432 --> 59:31.026
I don't know if Mommy
will want me to.

59:31.201 --> 59:35.137
All right, just drink it, okay? Just like
Daddy does. Let me show you, okay?

59:35.305 --> 59:37.500
Okay.

59:40.778 --> 59:42.268
I'm just like Daddy.

59:43.480 --> 59:44.640
There you go.

59:44.815 --> 59:45.873
No more booby milk.

59:46.683 --> 59:48.878
More for us.

59:49.052 --> 59:52.146
So, ladies, how do we get
Mr. Banana Hammock...

59:52.322 --> 59:55.382
...to come over here, where we can get
a better look at him?

59:55.559 --> 59:58.995
Okay. Well, there's two big
advantages to breast-feeding...

59:59.196 --> 01:00:01.323
...and I'm gonna put mine to work.

01:00:01.498 --> 01:00:02.795
Sally.

01:00:03.967 --> 01:00:05.628
That's it, girl.

01:00:05.803 --> 01:00:07.065
Oh, my goodness.

01:00:07.237 --> 01:00:10.604
- Work that umbrella pole, baby.
- Sally. Oh, my God.

01:00:10.774 --> 01:00:13.436
- Oh, it's definitely working. Yeah.
- You're good at that.

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:16.511
- Oh, my God, he likes it.
- Look at him flex.

01:00:16.713 --> 01:00:18.578
No, continue.

01:00:19.383 --> 01:00:22.318
All right, doing the back-door shuffle.
Cutting the line. Go.

01:00:22.486 --> 01:00:23.510
Don't get hurt.

01:00:23.687 --> 01:00:24.711
Go, go, go.

01:00:24.888 --> 01:00:26.879
Dad, are we allowed
to go through here?

01:00:27.291 --> 01:00:29.316
Absolutely not,
but we're doing it anyway.

01:00:29.493 --> 01:00:32.155
All right, your cool dad found this
back in the day.

01:00:33.864 --> 01:00:35.627
Go up the ladder.

01:00:35.799 --> 01:00:38.529
It's dark in there.
Maybe you should hold my hand.

01:00:38.735 --> 01:00:39.929
I'm scared.

01:00:40.103 --> 01:00:41.968
Hey. Come here, come here.

01:00:42.139 --> 01:00:44.505
Don't fall for that crap.
You stay away from him.

01:00:44.675 --> 01:00:46.905
What are you talking about?
He's gay, isn't he?

01:00:47.077 --> 01:00:48.806
No. He just seems gay.

01:00:48.979 --> 01:00:50.276
He's a genius.

01:00:50.447 --> 01:00:51.846
Go, go, go.

01:00:54.218 --> 01:00:56.243
Alrighty, who's next?

01:00:57.421 --> 01:00:58.513
All right, who's next?

01:00:58.689 --> 01:01:01.123
Now's a good time. Charlotte.

01:01:01.291 --> 01:01:03.122
You're up first.

01:01:03.293 --> 01:01:06.524
- There you go.
- Have fun, Charlotte.

01:01:06.697 --> 01:01:10.963
There you go. Who's next? Go.

01:01:13.737 --> 01:01:16.706
- Is he coming this way?
- He's coming towards us right now.

01:01:21.144 --> 01:01:22.304
- This is good now.
- He is.

01:01:22.479 --> 01:01:24.208
Whatever you do, don't fart.

01:01:30.988 --> 01:01:32.478
Hey, what's up, ladies?

01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:34.753
So you're from around
these parts, eh?

01:01:35.893 --> 01:01:39.454
Yeah, I'm from Saskatchetoon.
That's up in Canada, eh?

01:01:41.098 --> 01:01:44.067
You American ladies,
you've been out to Saskatchetoon, eh?

01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:52.669
Hoseteasers.

01:01:57.414 --> 01:02:01.316
Everything was on steroids
except for his voice.

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:03.678
Go, go, go.

01:02:03.854 --> 01:02:05.082
Out, out, out.

01:02:05.255 --> 01:02:06.984
Now, now, now.

01:02:14.765 --> 01:02:15.789
Next.

01:02:37.721 --> 01:02:40.622
All right, who's next?
Hey, weren't you guys just here?

01:02:40.791 --> 01:02:44.192
No. I think you have us confused
with some other people.

01:02:44.361 --> 01:02:48.559
I don't think so, you're two of the
hottest chicks I've ever seen in my life.

01:02:48.732 --> 01:02:50.131
- Hey.
- What?

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:52.427
- These are my daughters.
- Right.

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:54.126
Her, definitely.

01:02:54.304 --> 01:02:56.670
Because she's fugly, just like you.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:58.330
- Hey.
- Now, who's next?

01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:30.369
Dad. Come on. Hurry up,
I wanna go to Pirate's Plunge.

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:33.771
One second. Yeah, we're going
on all the rides. We're doing them all.

01:03:33.944 --> 01:03:35.002
We'll have fun.

01:03:36.013 --> 01:03:37.503
Are you making a sissy?

01:03:38.915 --> 01:03:39.939
No, I'm not.

01:03:40.117 --> 01:03:43.086
You know they put a chemical
in the pool that turns urine blue.

01:03:43.253 --> 01:03:46.984
No, no, no, that's an old wives' tale,
sweetie. That's an old wives' tale.

01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:49.682
Oh, my God.
You're humiliating me.

01:04:12.215 --> 01:04:13.546
Mama, Mama.

01:04:13.717 --> 01:04:15.082
Wanna take a picture?

01:04:15.252 --> 01:04:17.482
All right. A little farther.

01:04:18.088 --> 01:04:19.112
Farther.

01:04:19.289 --> 01:04:21.086
Farther.

01:04:25.062 --> 01:04:26.586
Gotcha.

01:04:44.481 --> 01:04:46.915
I don't know about this one, Dad.
It's kind of steep.

01:04:47.084 --> 01:04:48.915
It's a little steeper than I remember.

01:04:49.086 --> 01:04:50.553
Okay, let's go on another ride.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:53.621
- I don't like it either, yeah.
- Come on, we'll get out of here.

01:04:53.790 --> 01:04:57.453
Good thing the kid chickened out
so you don't have to go, right, Feder?

01:04:57.627 --> 01:05:01.358
Why don't you hire somebody
to do it for you, Mr. Richie Rich?

01:05:01.531 --> 01:05:04.125
Good idea.
Hey, Wiley, what's up, man?

01:05:04.301 --> 01:05:06.701
- Step aside. Let me get this on.
- All right, son.

01:05:08.472 --> 01:05:10.770
Hasta la vista, chicken shiznit.

01:05:10.941 --> 01:05:12.602
Yeah, look at him go.

01:05:14.177 --> 01:05:15.371
Go, kid.

01:05:18.815 --> 01:05:20.715
That was good. That was very nice.

01:05:20.884 --> 01:05:22.511
All right, now I want some of this.

01:05:22.686 --> 01:05:24.313
Look at this. Look at this.

01:05:24.488 --> 01:05:26.956
- What happened there?
- Attaboy. Way to go, Greggie.

01:05:27.124 --> 01:05:29.149
Backwards, huh? Look at him.

01:05:32.329 --> 01:05:34.194
Backwards, baby.

01:05:39.136 --> 01:05:40.398
You're up, Hollywood.

01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:43.471
I'm up? All right. I don't know how
you follow backwards.

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:46.404
Just pay attention to the dismount,
would you?

01:06:02.559 --> 01:06:04.823
Looks like second place again,
Bailey, huh?

01:06:05.328 --> 01:06:07.888
- Hear this guy? Second place.
- Second place.

01:06:08.265 --> 01:06:09.892
Go down there hanging by your feet.

01:06:10.066 --> 01:06:11.624
Show these idiots.

01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:12.825
By my feet?

01:06:13.303 --> 01:06:14.327
Yeah.

01:06:15.038 --> 01:06:16.062
Is that safe?

01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:19.338
What do you care? You're an animal.
You're an animal.

01:06:20.043 --> 01:06:21.271
I'm an animal.

01:06:22.512 --> 01:06:23.911
Wiley.

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:27.379
- Why don't you do it?
- I got kids.

01:06:27.551 --> 01:06:29.018
Yeah, Wiley.

01:06:29.186 --> 01:06:32.349
<i>Wiley, Wiley, Wiley.</i>

01:06:34.925 --> 01:06:36.722
Oh, you don't need to do this.

01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:41.424
I'm an animal.

01:06:42.365 --> 01:06:44.026
I'm an animal.

01:06:44.201 --> 01:06:45.293
Yeah.

01:06:45.468 --> 01:06:47.299
I can't get my foot out.

01:06:54.578 --> 01:06:55.772
That's how you do it, boy.

01:06:55.946 --> 01:06:57.880
- Becky.
- You can do this.

01:06:58.081 --> 01:07:00.481
- Good. There you go.
- Give me a five.

01:07:01.718 --> 01:07:04.414
Roxanne, look at him.
It's like he totally forgot about me.

01:07:04.588 --> 01:07:05.612
Typical man.

01:07:05.789 --> 01:07:09.247
They take all you can give and then
they trade you in for some cow.

01:07:09.426 --> 01:07:11.826
I don't know what I'm
supposed to do with these now.

01:07:11.995 --> 01:07:13.462
I do.

01:07:15.298 --> 01:07:17.766
Now, see that, buddy?

01:07:17.934 --> 01:07:21.335
I did the old bank shot.
Bank's open. Pick a spot. Aim for it.

01:07:21.504 --> 01:07:24.234
Oh, yeah. Your dad'll go
50 for 50 with these.

01:07:24.407 --> 01:07:27.001
Really? Because on the Wii,
the bank shot never works.

01:07:27.677 --> 01:07:30.168
Yeah? Well, you should Wii-turn
it and get a Wii-fund.

01:07:30.347 --> 01:07:33.407
Tim Duncan's had about a hundred
game winners with that bad boy.

01:07:33.583 --> 01:07:35.517
Honey, are you watching me?

01:07:35.685 --> 01:07:38.483
Oh, baby, that was hot.

01:07:38.655 --> 01:07:41.556
- Come here, let me show you.
- Way to go, baby.

01:07:41.725 --> 01:07:44.660
Move it, move it, move it.
What you gotta do is...

01:07:44.828 --> 01:07:47.490
See the box up there?
Top right corner of it?

01:07:47.664 --> 01:07:49.097
Hello?

01:07:49.633 --> 01:07:51.533
Focus, boy, focus. Get off of that.

01:07:51.701 --> 01:07:52.998
Lamonsoff, focus.

01:07:55.405 --> 01:07:57.703
Oh, my God, what a perv.

01:07:57.907 --> 01:07:59.841
He's totally checking me out.

01:08:00.010 --> 01:08:01.773
He wasn't... I don't know.

01:08:01.945 --> 01:08:03.537
All right, come on. Go ahead.

01:08:04.347 --> 01:08:06.076
Follow through. Keep the hand up.

01:08:06.249 --> 01:08:07.716
Are you kidding me?

01:08:07.884 --> 01:08:09.215
Respect.

01:08:09.386 --> 01:08:11.877
See how good you can be when
you wear normal clothes?

01:08:12.055 --> 01:08:13.682
- Hey, Mama.
- Hey, baby.

01:08:13.857 --> 01:08:16.121
How come you're not
out there playing basketball?

01:08:16.292 --> 01:08:19.558
- You know I got...
- You got bunions. Where's Kurt?

01:08:19.729 --> 01:08:20.821
Come on, are you scared?

01:08:20.997 --> 01:08:22.828
What's wrong with you?

01:08:23.867 --> 01:08:25.232
Stop it.

01:08:26.368 --> 01:08:28.428
Somebody's in trouble.

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:30.307
Not looking good.

01:08:33.810 --> 01:08:35.437
I do the same thing.

01:08:37.514 --> 01:08:40.846
All right, I did everybody's first shot
for them.

01:08:41.017 --> 01:08:42.678
Now you do the second one.

01:08:42.852 --> 01:08:44.546
Come on, now.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:46.051
No, nobody's doing shots.

01:08:46.523 --> 01:08:49.185
We got kids here, dummy.
Gotta wake up in the morning.

01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:52.658
We're gonna biz beers instead.
Who's got beers? Check them off.

01:08:52.828 --> 01:08:55.593
- I'm gonna go with one.
- Yeah, I'll stick with coffee.

01:08:55.765 --> 01:08:57.163
- I'm having this many.
- Cheers.

01:08:57.334 --> 01:09:01.100
- I'm breast-feeding, I don't drink.
- I'm just having Metamucil tonight.

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:02.898
What's wrong with you guys?

01:09:03.106 --> 01:09:07.872
We used to come up here and party,
man, and get wasted.

01:09:08.044 --> 01:09:09.341
You losers.

01:09:09.511 --> 01:09:12.948
Don't worry, you'll grow up one day.
You just have to meet the right girl.

01:09:13.116 --> 01:09:16.346
Oh, my older sister
would be perfect for you.

01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:18.479
What?

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:22.591
She's legally blind,
but she can see shapes.

01:09:23.026 --> 01:09:26.189
Anyways, Roxanne,
how did you and Lenny meet?

01:09:26.363 --> 01:09:27.660
That's a good question.

01:09:27.831 --> 01:09:30.765
How did this blob of crap,
no offense...

01:09:31.267 --> 01:09:34.202
...meet this lovely señorita?

01:09:34.371 --> 01:09:37.966
Oh, he came into the department store
where I was working.

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:39.301
I helped him.

01:09:39.475 --> 01:09:41.774
He wanted me to try this skirt on.

01:09:41.944 --> 01:09:44.379
Oh, the old "try on the skirt" trick.

01:09:44.546 --> 01:09:46.276
I got you. Very sneaky, sis.

01:09:46.448 --> 01:09:49.885
Yeah, he did trick me. Afterwards
he made me try on a bra and...

01:09:50.053 --> 01:09:52.317
Hey, I was just trying to help.

01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:55.219
- Exactly.
- Okay, okay. I did like him a little.

01:09:55.392 --> 01:09:57.326
It was a good day.

01:09:57.494 --> 01:10:00.224
Oh, God! Oh, my water.
My water's breaking.

01:10:00.397 --> 01:10:01.557
The baby's coming!

01:10:01.731 --> 01:10:05.633
- Are you serious?
- Oh, yeah.

01:10:05.802 --> 01:10:06.996
Oh, you.

01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:08.731
Oh, my God.

01:10:08.905 --> 01:10:11.032
I got you, I got you, I got you.

01:10:11.207 --> 01:10:12.697
All right.

01:10:12.876 --> 01:10:14.639
I'm just playing.

01:10:16.446 --> 01:10:18.311
Oh, my God, it's...

01:10:18.915 --> 01:10:22.578
Do you know this song?
Oh, this song's the best.

01:10:24.454 --> 01:10:26.149
This song is the best.

01:10:28.958 --> 01:10:31.984
Oh, this song gets me so horny.

01:10:32.829 --> 01:10:35.457
You know, I was thinking that,
but now not so much.

01:10:35.632 --> 01:10:37.224
I'd like to claim credit for that.

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:40.563
Because that's all part of my
"get some nookie" playlist.

01:10:40.737 --> 01:10:43.706
Get the ladies on the dance floor,
and I got my lady right here.

01:10:43.873 --> 01:10:45.340
Come on, honey.

01:10:45.542 --> 01:10:47.772
- That was a really good move.
- Let's do this.

01:10:47.944 --> 01:10:49.411
Yeah, you guys dance.

01:10:49.579 --> 01:10:52.047
- It has been a while.
- A long while.

01:10:52.215 --> 01:10:53.910
I know how much you love to dance.

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:56.984
Oh, you know me,
I'm a regular Shabba-Doo.

01:11:15.171 --> 01:11:16.934
Look at you.

01:11:17.307 --> 01:11:19.832
All sexy. Deanne.

01:11:20.009 --> 01:11:22.136
You should change your name
to Deyoncé.

01:11:22.312 --> 01:11:23.336
Oh, God.

01:11:23.513 --> 01:11:25.845
Yeah, so now he thinks
I'm sexy, huh?

01:11:26.015 --> 01:11:29.178
Can I just enjoy a dance
with my fine-ass wife?

01:11:30.153 --> 01:11:32.815
Yes. To the whitest song ever. Yes.

01:11:32.989 --> 01:11:36.254
Yes, this is the whitest song
I've ever heard.

01:11:36.793 --> 01:11:40.229
You know, Lenny, you were right
about bringing us here.

01:11:40.396 --> 01:11:41.954
This place is really special.

01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:43.792
It is, right?

01:11:43.967 --> 01:11:47.266
Nothing's going on here,
and I love it.

01:11:47.437 --> 01:11:50.895
Roxanne, I have made out with about
25 different girls in this very spot...

01:11:51.074 --> 01:11:52.769
...and I want you to be number 26.

01:11:53.209 --> 01:11:54.574
As long as I'm the last one.

01:11:54.744 --> 01:11:56.837
Oh, that's a guarantee.

01:11:57.714 --> 01:11:59.682
I'm horny too.

01:12:00.016 --> 01:12:02.507
Hey, what are you doing? You idiot.

01:12:15.064 --> 01:12:18.192
Lamonsoff. What are you doing up?

01:12:20.436 --> 01:12:22.927
- I gotta tell you, it was crazy.
- What?

01:12:23.106 --> 01:12:24.937
Sally. She just attacked me.

01:12:25.108 --> 01:12:27.440
Like never before. It was insane.

01:12:27.610 --> 01:12:29.703
I just did the same thing
with my woman.

01:12:29.879 --> 01:12:31.312
Really?

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:39.184
Hey, where's Saskatchetoon?

01:12:39.455 --> 01:12:42.049
Yeah. I don't know.

01:12:53.636 --> 01:12:56.230
- What am I?
- A hoseteaser.

01:12:56.406 --> 01:12:58.897
- And where are you from?
- Saskatchetoon.

01:12:59.642 --> 01:13:01.303
Look at this.

01:13:01.477 --> 01:13:02.808
- And what am I?
- A hoseteaser.

01:13:02.979 --> 01:13:05.743
- And where are you from?
- Saskatchetoon.

01:13:06.816 --> 01:13:08.408
What are we gonna do
with Higgins?

01:13:08.585 --> 01:13:11.452
Yeah, and you know what?
This is what pisses me off:

01:13:11.621 --> 01:13:15.489
You can't be passed-out drunk, single,
with no responsibility and not pay.

01:13:15.658 --> 01:13:16.989
You have to be hurt for that.

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:18.957
Yeah.

01:13:19.762 --> 01:13:21.662
Sweetheart?

01:13:21.831 --> 01:13:24.595
You fell asleep on the couch again.

01:13:25.501 --> 01:13:27.867
You know you supposed
to go to your room.

01:13:28.037 --> 01:13:29.504
You're bad.

01:13:29.672 --> 01:13:30.696
No.

01:13:31.574 --> 01:13:33.269
Marcus, the bird is all better.

01:13:33.443 --> 01:13:36.571
Marcus. He wants to talk to you.

01:13:40.316 --> 01:13:44.309
Marcus, you're gonna be the best
lifeguard at the whole pool.

01:13:44.487 --> 01:13:45.784
Hold your breath, honey.

01:13:45.955 --> 01:13:48.150
Hold your breath, honey.

01:13:51.828 --> 01:13:52.988
Who's that?

01:13:53.162 --> 01:13:55.630
Oh, it's mommy's boyfriend.

01:13:55.798 --> 01:13:57.231
The one who touches you.

01:14:01.704 --> 01:14:03.001
He's crying, he's crying.

01:14:06.042 --> 01:14:07.839
- All right, quiet.
- Hi, Mama.

01:14:08.011 --> 01:14:10.206
- All right. It's all right.
- Mama?

01:14:10.413 --> 01:14:13.678
- Okay, baby. It's okay, precious.
- Mama?

01:14:13.850 --> 01:14:15.374
I'm gonna take you upstairs.

01:14:15.551 --> 01:14:19.248
Go and put your PJ's on, okay?
You can't fall asleep...

01:14:19.422 --> 01:14:22.016
You can't just sleep anywhere,
you know that.

01:14:22.191 --> 01:14:23.419
You go to your room.

01:14:23.593 --> 01:14:25.584
- Go to sleep.
- You go to your room.

01:14:25.762 --> 01:14:27.992
- What you doing?
- Come here.

01:14:28.164 --> 01:14:31.327
This isn't a closet.
This is your bedroom.

01:14:31.501 --> 01:14:35.597
Okay? It's also your bathroom.
You can make a pee-pee.

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:38.967
I'm making a pee-pee.

01:14:42.845 --> 01:14:45.313
Happy Fourth of July, everyone.

01:14:46.949 --> 01:14:50.544
It's the birdy's Independence Day too,
so keep your fingers crossed, honey.

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:52.312
- She did it, Daddy.
- Here we go.

01:14:52.488 --> 01:14:54.149
- Bye, birdy.
- She's flying.

01:14:54.323 --> 01:14:57.383
She's gonna be a veterinarian.
Is this girl incredible or what?

01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:06.125
That's so sexy. What did you say?

01:15:06.302 --> 01:15:07.769
Oh, I think that she said:

01:15:09.272 --> 01:15:10.864
Milan.

01:15:11.974 --> 01:15:14.875
You know, these guys at the store
were talking so much smack...

01:15:15.044 --> 01:15:17.706
...about this basketball rematch
that's supposed to go on.

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:20.178
Well, I'm glad we're getting
these uniforms ready.

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:23.284
No more drinkie.

01:15:24.153 --> 01:15:26.883
Did you really sleep in the closet,
you drunk?

01:15:29.292 --> 01:15:31.055
Think so.

01:15:33.296 --> 01:15:35.059
No.

01:15:35.832 --> 01:15:37.800
Oh, God, Higgins.

01:15:37.967 --> 01:15:40.527
- That's disgusting.
- You slob.

01:15:42.105 --> 01:15:47.543
Oh, I had the sexiest dream
about a little blond girl, though.

01:15:51.314 --> 01:15:53.111
I think it was a dream.

01:15:53.282 --> 01:15:55.842
- Oh, nice. Classy.
- Sick.

01:15:58.020 --> 01:16:01.615
These deviled eggs would really be
good if you had some marinara sauce.

01:16:01.791 --> 01:16:02.985
Oh, it's Lenny's phone.

01:16:03.159 --> 01:16:04.183
Hello?

01:16:04.594 --> 01:16:05.959
All right, here we go.

01:16:06.129 --> 01:16:07.289
Oh, that's a three.

01:16:07.463 --> 01:16:10.330
That's one, two, three, ladder.
Ladder.

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:13.469
Oh, that's it.
The rich keep getting richer.

01:16:13.636 --> 01:16:15.661
All right. All right.
Schniggly is here.

01:16:15.838 --> 01:16:18.432
So, come on, Robbie,
tell the man what's going on.

01:16:18.608 --> 01:16:19.700
He doesn't care.

01:16:19.876 --> 01:16:23.004
- Tell him.
- What are you talking about? Tell him.

01:16:23.179 --> 01:16:25.704
Gloria and I are thinking
about having a baby.

01:16:25.882 --> 01:16:26.940
How great is that?

01:16:29.018 --> 01:16:30.383
That's great.

01:16:30.553 --> 01:16:33.545
You know, the good news is she can't
get any more stretch marks.

01:16:34.657 --> 01:16:36.181
- Boy, that's a good one.
- Come on.

01:16:36.359 --> 01:16:40.318
You know, the good thing also is
Gloria and the kid can share diapers.

01:16:40.496 --> 01:16:41.963
Man. You see, that's just ugly.

01:16:42.131 --> 01:16:44.998
He doesn't get it. He's not
in a committed relationship.

01:16:45.168 --> 01:16:48.137
He can't, because he can't stay
in a committed relationship.

01:16:48.304 --> 01:16:51.171
Oh, look. He's just mad
because all the girls I go out with...

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:54.503
...are 70 to 80 years younger
than his wife.

01:16:54.677 --> 01:16:55.769
Can't stop.

01:16:55.945 --> 01:17:00.177
The last one I was with, she's blond,
she's tall, super hot. Not your type.

01:17:00.349 --> 01:17:03.807
Me and blondie, we start going at it
and we're shaking the bed...

01:17:03.986 --> 01:17:06.181
Shaking the bed?
What does shaking the bed mean?

01:17:06.355 --> 01:17:09.347
I don't know, I just know wetting
the bed. I don't know...

01:17:09.525 --> 01:17:11.584
And then, right at the "good part. "
you know?

01:17:11.761 --> 01:17:15.162
This picture behind, right on the wall,
falls and goes:

01:17:15.698 --> 01:17:16.995
Hits her on the forehead.

01:17:17.166 --> 01:17:18.326
She cut her head.

01:17:18.501 --> 01:17:20.128
It cuts her. I didn't slow down.

01:17:20.303 --> 01:17:23.363
I just throw her two aspirins,
she yaps on them like a Frisbee dog.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:29.178
I am tired. Marcus, your snoring
kept me up all night long.

01:17:33.516 --> 01:17:35.279
You're a dead man. Get back here.

01:17:35.451 --> 01:17:39.512
Come back here. That's my baby girl.
I thought you were my friend.

01:17:39.689 --> 01:17:41.384
Leave me alone. Drink your maize.

01:17:41.557 --> 01:17:43.718
You're gonna pay this time.

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:46.692
You bastard.
I'll show you how to be nice.

01:17:46.863 --> 01:17:49.127
- Bad turtles.
- You evil pig.

01:17:50.433 --> 01:17:52.060
- Robbie, wait.
- He's psycho.

01:17:52.235 --> 01:17:53.497
Stop. Stop.

01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:55.864
Hey, break it up, man. Jeez, guys.

01:17:56.038 --> 01:17:57.164
- All right.
- Calm down.

01:17:57.340 --> 01:17:59.240
Buddy. Buddy. What's the problem?

01:18:02.912 --> 01:18:05.073
Oh, yeah. Arrow foot.

01:18:05.248 --> 01:18:07.910
- Come here, baby.
- Come on. Why are you fighting?

01:18:08.084 --> 01:18:09.779
Good to see midget wrestling again.

01:18:09.952 --> 01:18:12.284
How could you do that?
That's my daughter.

01:18:12.455 --> 01:18:14.923
- Do what?
- Shake the bed with her.

01:18:15.091 --> 01:18:17.116
You think I would do that to you?

01:18:17.493 --> 01:18:19.791
Out of any of us
you'd be the one to do that.

01:18:19.962 --> 01:18:22.157
You did sleep
with Stimpson's mother.

01:18:22.331 --> 01:18:25.562
I didn't even know that guy.
He was your friend. I barely knew him.

01:18:25.735 --> 01:18:27.965
She grabbed my wiener,
I told you guys.

01:18:28.137 --> 01:18:30.401
- That's his daughter. It's different.
- Me and him?

01:18:31.641 --> 01:18:35.236
Okay. Maybe I flirted with him,
but that was just to get your attention.

01:18:35.411 --> 01:18:37.538
- Well, what about his snoring?
- I heard it too.

01:18:42.151 --> 01:18:44.119
Oh, no. Twice?

01:18:44.287 --> 01:18:46.152
We heard it from three rooms away.

01:18:46.322 --> 01:18:49.780
He's off the hook. You know Marcus
wouldn't be with your daughter.

01:18:49.959 --> 01:18:52.621
I mean, not that she's...
You know what I'm saying.

01:18:53.462 --> 01:18:56.898
- Well, what happened to your head?
- When I was changing into my PJs...

01:18:57.066 --> 01:19:00.194
...I got the feeling that some perv
was looking through my window...

01:19:00.369 --> 01:19:04.237
...so I went to go close the shade
and I tripped and hit my head.

01:19:04.774 --> 01:19:07.106
Yeah, dude, that's your daughter.

01:19:07.276 --> 01:19:09.710
I'd never be with her.
You're my best friend, man.

01:19:09.879 --> 01:19:12.347
And Jasmine'd never be with me,
because I'm me.

01:19:12.748 --> 01:19:15.649
Look, sorry I don't have
my whole life together, like Lenny.

01:19:15.818 --> 01:19:17.752
Oh, together, like Lenny.

01:19:18.421 --> 01:19:19.445
Please.

01:19:19.822 --> 01:19:21.619
<i>I answered your phone, hipócrita.</i>

01:19:21.791 --> 01:19:23.019
It was your assistant.

01:19:23.225 --> 01:19:26.160
I asked him if he canceled
the flight to Milan. He said he did.

01:19:26.329 --> 01:19:28.194
Before we even came here.

01:19:28.364 --> 01:19:31.162
He said that? Why would he say that?
I mean...

01:19:31.334 --> 01:19:32.824
So he just made that up, huh?

01:19:33.002 --> 01:19:34.594
I'm not saying he made it up.

01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:37.466
I'm think...
In his head he believes it's true.

01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:39.198
Don't you agent me, Lenny.

01:19:39.375 --> 01:19:41.809
Stop trying to handle
everybody and everything...

01:19:41.978 --> 01:19:44.606
...and start taking a little
responsibility for once.

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:47.305
I'll take responsibility.
Okay? You're right.

01:19:47.483 --> 01:19:51.010
I thought it would be better for our
family to be here with normal people...

01:19:51.187 --> 01:19:52.950
...instead of going to Milan.

01:19:53.122 --> 01:19:54.384
We're normal?

01:19:54.557 --> 01:19:58.288
I was scared to tell you.
It was easier for me to keep it a secret.

01:19:58.461 --> 01:20:01.294
You peel back any marriage,
there are secrets.

01:20:01.697 --> 01:20:03.961
Mine is I love you.
I love you very much.

01:20:04.133 --> 01:20:05.828
Roxanne, I just... I...

01:20:06.002 --> 01:20:10.234
Our kids are becoming nutty,
snotty, spoiled...

01:20:11.073 --> 01:20:13.633
- We got a nanny, we got...
- So she is a nanny.

01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:15.208
No, no, no. She's not a nanny.

01:20:15.378 --> 01:20:17.209
Of course she's a nanny.

01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:19.405
When does the lying stop?

01:20:19.582 --> 01:20:20.879
It stops right after this.

01:20:21.050 --> 01:20:22.984
She's more of an au pair.
Not a nanny.

01:20:23.152 --> 01:20:24.881
Lenny.

01:20:25.588 --> 01:20:28.751
All right. That's it.
The lying stops now.

01:20:28.924 --> 01:20:31.188
I won't lie to you ever again.
I swear to God.

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:32.657
I love you.

01:20:32.828 --> 01:20:34.318
Men lie.

01:20:34.730 --> 01:20:36.664
They can't help themselves.

01:20:36.832 --> 01:20:38.766
Kurt sure as hell lies.

01:20:38.934 --> 01:20:41.425
What do I lie about,
Toe-J Simpson?

01:20:41.604 --> 01:20:43.697
Oh, please. The nanny.

01:20:44.073 --> 01:20:45.199
What about the nanny?

01:20:45.374 --> 01:20:47.399
You have a thing for her.

01:20:47.576 --> 01:20:51.569
I do not have a thing for the nanny.
I'm a married man. Period.

01:20:52.014 --> 01:20:55.643
But did I enjoy a nice conversation
with a woman that wasn't going...

01:20:55.818 --> 01:20:59.618
..."Where's this?" and
"Did you pick up that?" Yeah.

01:20:59.789 --> 01:21:01.916
What, you can have
nice conversations with me.

01:21:02.425 --> 01:21:04.256
When? You're always working.

01:21:04.427 --> 01:21:07.123
And when you come home,
you're just tired all the time.

01:21:07.329 --> 01:21:09.559
You barely even touch me
or look at me.

01:21:09.732 --> 01:21:12.428
He sounds like an old woman.

01:21:12.601 --> 01:21:16.867
Deanne, you should have married
Umberto Denunzio like I told you.

01:21:17.039 --> 01:21:21.271
And if I had stayed with him you'd be
the one that's pregnant now, Mama.

01:21:21.844 --> 01:21:23.971
You probably right, sweetheart.

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:25.870
I'll just butt out.

01:21:26.048 --> 01:21:27.709
Thank you.

01:21:27.883 --> 01:21:30.875
Look, maybe I do take you for granted,
and I'm sorry.

01:21:31.387 --> 01:21:34.481
How's about I take you out every
Thursday night for date night.

01:21:35.057 --> 01:21:38.823
<i>No, Thursday's Grey's Anatomy,
but any other night would be beautiful.</i>

01:21:40.262 --> 01:21:45.859
And as long as we're all being honest,
I think I should be honest too.

01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:51.134
I'm actually not a part owner
of the lawn furniture store.

01:21:51.307 --> 01:21:54.242
I don't even work there anymore.

01:21:54.410 --> 01:21:56.776
I got laid off in April.

01:21:56.946 --> 01:21:58.743
But I rented the Caddy...

01:21:58.914 --> 01:22:02.782
...and I acted like a big shot because
I didn't want you guys to know.

01:22:02.952 --> 01:22:04.180
Lamonsoff.

01:22:04.353 --> 01:22:06.981
You don't have to hide
anything from us. I'm sorry.

01:22:07.156 --> 01:22:10.956
Yeah. Since we're getting things
off our chests here...

01:22:11.127 --> 01:22:13.288
...I got a confession to make.

01:22:15.464 --> 01:22:16.692
I'm wearing a toup.

01:22:16.866 --> 01:22:18.197
No shit.

01:22:20.503 --> 01:22:22.266
I have a confession to make.

01:22:23.772 --> 01:22:25.171
I'm really a man.

01:22:25.841 --> 01:22:28.002
- No.
- I said that.

01:22:28.177 --> 01:22:32.773
- Are you kidding?
- No, I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.

01:22:32.948 --> 01:22:35.883
I'm really a little hurt that so many
of you believed it.

01:22:36.051 --> 01:22:38.383
- We were just saying that...
- You're very womanly.

01:22:38.554 --> 01:22:42.786
Nevertheless.
I know it's not my place, but...

01:22:42.958 --> 01:22:45.722
Well, after all,
I am older than anyone here.

01:22:45.895 --> 01:22:47.726
Hell, yeah, you are.

01:22:49.532 --> 01:22:53.468
Well, despite the joking and
the razzing, I see a lot of love here.

01:22:53.636 --> 01:22:56.662
And with love comes hostility.

01:22:57.006 --> 01:23:00.965
Like Rob when he snapped at me
the other day.

01:23:01.143 --> 01:23:02.303
That was scary.

01:23:02.478 --> 01:23:05.379
And you all thought that I was so calm,
but inside?

01:23:05.548 --> 01:23:07.175
Inside I was saying:

01:23:07.349 --> 01:23:08.976
"Gloria Noonan...

01:23:09.218 --> 01:23:13.086
...do not call him a bug-eyed sociopath
with a little-man complex.

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:17.849
Do not say that his hair makes him
look like a dirty Q-tip. "

01:23:18.027 --> 01:23:19.051
I like that.

01:23:19.662 --> 01:23:23.428
"Or that he resembles an elder gay
Jonas brother. "

01:23:23.599 --> 01:23:26.591
They get it. They get the point
of where you're going.

01:23:26.769 --> 01:23:29.329
"Or a midget Filipino Fonzie. "
I didn't say those things.

01:23:29.505 --> 01:23:31.769
- That's my favorite one.
- Hey.

01:23:31.941 --> 01:23:33.238
Toupee.

01:23:33.409 --> 01:23:35.900
Life can be difficult sometimes.

01:23:36.078 --> 01:23:39.172
It gets bumpy,
what with family and kids...

01:23:39.348 --> 01:23:42.340
...and things not going
exactly like you planned.

01:23:42.518 --> 01:23:44.918
But that's what makes it interesting.

01:23:45.087 --> 01:23:48.352
In life, the first act, always exciting.

01:23:48.524 --> 01:23:50.617
The second act...

01:23:51.060 --> 01:23:53.028
...that's where the depth comes in.

01:23:54.730 --> 01:23:56.789
Why didn't you ever tell us
that she gets it?

01:23:56.966 --> 01:23:58.456
Yeah, you were holding out.

01:23:58.634 --> 01:24:00.898
That's what I've been trying
to tell you guys.

01:24:01.070 --> 01:24:03.402
That was beautiful, honey.
That was beautiful.

01:24:06.442 --> 01:24:07.807
Group hug.

01:24:37.072 --> 01:24:38.471
Okay, it's in position.

01:24:38.641 --> 01:24:40.541
I don't know, man.
This thing looks crazy.

01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:43.473
It'll be fun. I spent all morning
blowing that thing up.

01:24:43.646 --> 01:24:44.943
You should be all right.

01:24:45.114 --> 01:24:47.605
- Should be?
- Yeah.

01:24:49.151 --> 01:24:50.778
Ready?

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:52.753
Go.

01:25:00.596 --> 01:25:02.291
Let's do that again.

01:25:02.464 --> 01:25:05.490
It's not a favor. It's like a great
investment for me, man.

01:25:05.668 --> 01:25:07.158
A car detailing center.

01:25:07.336 --> 01:25:09.600
And there's none around,
it's gonna be a goldmine.

01:25:09.772 --> 01:25:11.330
I don't wanna take your money.

01:25:11.507 --> 01:25:14.374
- You're making me more.
- I want in, okay?

01:25:14.543 --> 01:25:17.478
I know the owner of the Celtics.
And I can get us that account.

01:25:17.646 --> 01:25:20.012
Those guys all drive
Bentleys and Ferraris.

01:25:20.182 --> 01:25:21.706
How do you know
the owner of the Celtics?

01:25:21.884 --> 01:25:24.478
Hey, I'm the leader
of his daughter's Girl Scout troop.

01:25:24.653 --> 01:25:27.383
If he wants to make sure
she gets her Cookie Biz badge...

01:25:27.556 --> 01:25:29.046
...he will give us that account.

01:25:30.759 --> 01:25:32.693
- I love you guys.
- I love it. I love it.

01:25:35.564 --> 01:25:37.464
You ready to have some fun?

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.194
Yeah. Hit it.

01:25:43.405 --> 01:25:45.066
Okay.

01:25:50.312 --> 01:25:52.405
Go. Go. You gotta get it in high.

01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:02.820
You really wanna do this, Bailey?

01:26:02.991 --> 01:26:04.652
My five against your five.

01:26:04.827 --> 01:26:06.556
Oh, boy, look at this.

01:26:06.729 --> 01:26:08.492
I see the boys
stayed in shape, huh?

01:26:09.998 --> 01:26:11.488
Robideaux, good to see you.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.024
Lenny.

01:26:13.202 --> 01:26:15.102
If you're looking at me, I don't know.

01:26:18.407 --> 01:26:22.309
Look, we just wanna eat watermelon
and relax, if you're all right with that.

01:26:22.478 --> 01:26:26.414
Oh, no. It's not all right. You're not
gonna weasel out of this one, Feder.

01:26:26.582 --> 01:26:30.712
Wiley snuck out of intensive care
to see you finally get some justice.

01:26:30.886 --> 01:26:33.912
Yo. You best be getting
to balling, Feder.

01:26:34.089 --> 01:26:37.115
Oh, hey, Wiley.
Was the field goal good?

01:26:37.593 --> 01:26:39.891
Yeah.
First time I ever heard that one.

01:26:40.062 --> 01:26:42.053
Okay. Sorry, man.

01:26:42.698 --> 01:26:46.532
Do you want me to get something off
the top shelf? Heard that one a lot too.

01:26:47.536 --> 01:26:50.972
Seriously, Dickie, let us just hang out
with our families. We wanna relax.

01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:53.904
Yeah. They're afraid of us.
That's what it is.

01:26:54.076 --> 01:26:57.136
We're afraid you might eat the ball
before we even start the game.

01:26:57.746 --> 01:27:01.876
Same old Higgins.
He can talk the talk but he can't...

01:27:02.451 --> 01:27:04.476
I forget the rest.

01:27:05.554 --> 01:27:09.217
We got Rob here with the bad foot.
You can't do it, right, buddy?

01:27:10.426 --> 01:27:14.055
I think if the Buzzer was here,
he'd want me to try.

01:27:14.596 --> 01:27:16.621
I think he'd want us all to try.

01:27:17.399 --> 01:27:18.832
Was that William Shatner?

01:27:20.269 --> 01:27:23.602
- All right, let's do this, then.
- It's on.

01:27:24.807 --> 01:27:25.831
Game to 21.

01:27:35.751 --> 01:27:36.843
Hey, hey. Okay, come on.

01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:46.619
Guys! Look!

01:28:26.001 --> 01:28:29.061
Well, well, well, if it isn't the other
black guy who grew up here.

01:28:29.238 --> 01:28:32.696
No, no, no. In this town, I'm the black
guy and you're the other black guy.

01:28:32.875 --> 01:28:34.740
No, man, in this town,
I'm the black guy.

01:28:34.910 --> 01:28:37.470
White people see me coming
in their store, they get scared.

01:28:37.646 --> 01:28:40.672
Yeah? When white people see me
coming into their store, they run.

01:28:40.849 --> 01:28:43.181
Yeah, yeah. These my white people.
Go get your own.

01:28:43.352 --> 01:28:45.183
You crazy, man.

01:28:58.133 --> 01:28:59.998
Lucky shot.

01:29:02.671 --> 01:29:04.366
<i>Defense, defense, defense.</i>

01:29:09.444 --> 01:29:11.036
In your face.

01:29:13.782 --> 01:29:16.216
Hey, guys. Motion '78.

01:29:32.134 --> 01:29:33.533
<i>To me, man.</i>

01:29:47.616 --> 01:29:50.380
Show me what you got. Say what?

01:29:50.552 --> 01:29:53.487
Hey, Y! Where's M-C-A?

01:30:01.597 --> 01:30:04.828
What the hell is that?
Sounds like owls having sex.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.433
Robideaux, heads up.

01:30:09.771 --> 01:30:13.366
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Did that go in?

01:30:30.325 --> 01:30:33.021
You made me spill
my freaking beer.

01:30:33.195 --> 01:30:35.720
Honey, why does everything
always have to be about you?

01:30:35.897 --> 01:30:37.956
Why do you always have to be
such a dink?

01:30:49.811 --> 01:30:51.745
Get that. Yeah, yeah, right there.

01:30:52.547 --> 01:30:54.105
I can't do this anymore.

01:30:54.282 --> 01:30:55.476
I can't even breathe.

01:30:55.651 --> 01:30:58.313
I haven't felt my legs
since the second quarter.

01:30:58.487 --> 01:31:00.045
Hey, you wanna fake injuries?

01:31:00.222 --> 01:31:01.456
- You got it.
- Okay.

01:31:02.391 --> 01:31:03.551
- Oh, my...
- Oh, God!

01:31:03.725 --> 01:31:05.784
I can't go on.
I got a slippery disk.

01:31:05.961 --> 01:31:07.223
Oh, hon.

01:31:07.396 --> 01:31:09.159
- Oh, it just slipped out.
- I'm done.

01:31:09.331 --> 01:31:11.697
Somebody's gonna have
a heart attack.

01:31:11.867 --> 01:31:13.391
What are you doing?

01:31:13.568 --> 01:31:15.001
That's it?

01:31:15.170 --> 01:31:16.694
Darth Vader, let's go. Sit down.

01:31:16.872 --> 01:31:18.203
Please, honey.

01:31:18.373 --> 01:31:20.307
Is that a cannoli from Virgilio's?

01:31:22.244 --> 01:31:24.712
Did you seriously just take
your daughter's cannoli?

01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:26.905
It's from Virgilio's. Leave me alone.

01:31:27.082 --> 01:31:28.811
Don't choke, Daddy.

01:31:29.251 --> 01:31:32.414
What do you say we bring my son
and your son into this?

01:31:32.587 --> 01:31:34.248
- Done.
- Greggie.

01:31:34.423 --> 01:31:37.017
- Me?
- Yeah. Go, Greg.

01:31:37.192 --> 01:31:39.183
Come on, baby. You can do this.

01:31:39.361 --> 01:31:40.419
Hey, Bailey.

01:31:41.263 --> 01:31:45.597
Somebody fill up that jug with some
Boss water, for the Hollywood kid.

01:31:45.767 --> 01:31:47.394
It's Voss, with a V.

01:31:49.838 --> 01:31:54.172
Would you mind if I touch your belly?
I love babies. I love to feel them kick.

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:56.435
- Yeah, go ahead.
- Oh, thank you.

01:32:00.782 --> 01:32:03.182
That's not my baby, that's my boob.

01:32:03.351 --> 01:32:05.182
- Oh, I like to feel those too.
- Hey.

01:32:05.353 --> 01:32:07.787
Hey, no harm done.

01:32:07.956 --> 01:32:10.220
- All right, take it out. Come on.
- Sixteen to 16.

01:32:10.392 --> 01:32:12.383
Half court, two on two. Let's go.

01:32:13.895 --> 01:32:15.886
Keep your feet off the line this time.

01:32:16.064 --> 01:32:18.965
It's tied score. Tied score.
Let's see something. Nice throw.

01:32:19.134 --> 01:32:20.431
Tied score, guys.

01:32:26.274 --> 01:32:28.242
All right, son. All right.

01:32:28.410 --> 01:32:32.642
- We're up 19-16. Let's go.
- All right, son. Give me the ball.

01:32:33.749 --> 01:32:36.274
- Come on, son.
- That's it, Greg. You can do it.

01:32:36.451 --> 01:32:37.782
You know what's going on.

01:32:43.425 --> 01:32:45.985
Oh, yes. It's raining threes
on Hollywood.

01:32:46.161 --> 01:32:49.187
His foot was on the line.
Your foot was on the line.

01:32:49.364 --> 01:32:51.127
It ain't raining threes.

01:32:51.299 --> 01:32:54.291
- It's drizzling twos!
- That's all right. Good shot.

01:32:54.469 --> 01:32:57.768
- Wasn't no three. Foot was on the line.
- Next basket wins. Let's go.

01:32:58.273 --> 01:32:59.638
Come on.

01:33:01.276 --> 01:33:02.402
This is it, pal.

01:33:02.978 --> 01:33:05.071
Take him out, baby.

01:33:06.248 --> 01:33:09.183
All right, all right, all right.
Take him, baby. Take him.

01:33:14.089 --> 01:33:15.317
Pop it, Lenny.

01:33:17.159 --> 01:33:19.252
Bank's open, Dad.

01:33:45.353 --> 01:33:46.615
He never misses that shot.

01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:53.187
Down goes Hollywood.

01:33:53.361 --> 01:33:55.022
Down goes Hollywood.

01:33:55.197 --> 01:33:57.062
Down goes Hollywood.

01:33:59.234 --> 01:34:03.500
We'll crush them next year. I'll work
on my left when we get back to L. A.

01:34:03.672 --> 01:34:05.697
- That's my boy. I love you.
- I love you too.

01:34:05.874 --> 01:34:06.898
You're awesome.

01:34:08.210 --> 01:34:10.371
- Way to go!
- We did it!

01:34:42.711 --> 01:34:44.269
Hey, Lenny.

01:34:44.446 --> 01:34:46.880
I thought you never missed
a bank shot.

01:34:47.048 --> 01:34:49.107
Yeah. Well, I just thought...

01:34:49.551 --> 01:34:53.214
...the Baileys needed to learn how
to win every once in a while...

01:34:53.388 --> 01:34:56.186
...and Feders needed to learn
how to lose.

01:34:57.626 --> 01:34:58.923
- That was nice.
- Yeah?

01:34:59.094 --> 01:35:01.028
I'm proud of you.

01:35:01.997 --> 01:35:03.123
Look at these guys.

01:35:07.602 --> 01:35:09.934
- Lenny. Hey, man.
- Yeah, buddy.

01:35:10.105 --> 01:35:12.767
I know you're bummed about losing
the game for us.

01:35:12.941 --> 01:35:13.965
And you're drunk?

01:35:14.142 --> 01:35:16.872
- No. Yes.
- Oh, okay.

01:35:17.045 --> 01:35:19.479
Hey, man, there's one thing
they'll never beat us at.

01:35:19.648 --> 01:35:21.445
What's this?

01:35:22.150 --> 01:35:24.983
Arrow roulette, baby.

01:35:25.153 --> 01:35:26.643
- We are good at that.
- Yeah.

01:35:26.821 --> 01:35:28.379
- All right.
- What are you doing?

01:35:28.556 --> 01:35:30.649
- Last one to stay in wins.
- No, no, no.

01:35:30.825 --> 01:35:32.486
Becky.

01:35:34.562 --> 01:35:37.292
Run away. Not again.

01:35:38.033 --> 01:35:39.796
Get out of my way.

01:35:57.986 --> 01:36:00.580
Little help here? Take me with you?

01:36:00.755 --> 01:36:03.315
Seriously, you're gonna leave me?

01:36:03.491 --> 01:36:04.583
No.

01:36:09.998 --> 01:36:12.262
We win again.
