in my way,

Yes, but we don't have to be, okay?

I didn't even want to go hiking.

we're going to die in here!

- Yeah?

12:55.400 --> 12:58.210
You stick here with me,
we can help Ash and Pablo

12:58.360 --> 13:01.045
and maybe have a chance
to see tomorrow.

has killed her,

29:00.400 --> 29:02.004
it'll kill him, too.

29:02.160 --> 29:04.481
- Nothing you can do about it.
- Except kill you.

29:04.640 --> 29:10.010
Or... you could take the deal.

29:10.160 --> 29:12.527
Think about it, Ash.
You are old and fat and weak.

29:12.680 --> 29:14.682
You cannot keep this up forever.

29:14.840 --> 29:17.525
Lay down your weapons
and go back to your life.

29:17.680 --> 29:20.411
You know that deep down
we both want the same thing.

29:20.560 --> 29:22.847
No, I'm pretty sure I don't
want to destroy humanity.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.002
I don't want to destroy anything.

29:25.200 --> 29:27.248
I want humanity to flourish.

29:27.400 --> 29:29.368
Without good,
there is no evil.

29:29.520 --> 29:33.525
I just want evil under control.
Same as you.

29:33.680 --> 29:37.844
The difference is you never
signed up for any of this.

29:38.040 --> 29:39.246
Ash, your entire life

29:39.400 --> 29:41.528

and desperation

29:41.680 --> 29:43.205

- Ow.

29:49.520 --> 29:50.806
Just take the deal.

29:50.960 --> 29:54.089
It's what you've always wanted.

29:54.240 --> 29:56.368
No.

29:56.560 --> 29:58.369
It's not just about
my life anymore.

29:58.560 --> 30:00.289
I want their lives back, too.
They're coming with me.

30:00.480 --> 30:03.051
- I can do that.
- Prove it.

30:18.080 --> 30:20.162
Okay. We're halfway there.
Pablo, too.

30:20.320 --> 30:21.321
Do we have a deal?

30:21.480 --> 30:23.960
Ash! No!

30:24.120 --> 30:27.567
What I let out there,
it's terrible.

30:27.760 --> 30:30.081
- You can't just do this.
- Hey!

30:30.240 --> 30:33.289
I'm doing this for you, buddy,
so a little thanks might be nice.

30:33.440 --> 30:36.410
Look, she's just going to Godfather
all the demons together,

30:36.600 --> 30:37.931
make the world a better place.

30:38.080 --> 30:39.605
That logic seems wrong.

30:39.760 --> 30:41.444
Look, you're just going to
have to trust me on this one.

30:41.600 --> 30:44.922
Let her be the gatekeeper.
It's better for all of us.

30:45.080 --> 30:46.286
Okay.

30:46.440 --> 30:51.082
Normal life in Jacksonville,
the three of us,

30:51.280 --> 30:53.647
and $10,000 in cash.

30:53.800 --> 30:55.245
I'm not a bank.

30:57.120 --> 30:59.009
Gas money?
You got that?

30:59.160 --> 31:01.401
Oh, sure.
But gas money...

31:03.120 --> 31:04.884
Huh? Huh?

31:05.040 --> 31:08.089
- ( Sighs )
- Oh. What?

31:09.800 --> 31:11.450
Okay.

31:11.600 --> 31:13.523
But I'm keeping this
just for insurance.

31:18.120 --> 31:19.963
- Truce.
- No!

31:20.120 --> 31:21.485
Ash!

31:21.640 --> 31:24.610
You have no idea
what's out there!

31:38.800 --> 31:41.485
Ah, good fishing.
That's what's out there.

I finally got the big end.

That's one way to look at it.

32:04.680 --> 32:06.682
The other, correct way,

32:06.840 --> 32:08.888
is that evil's going to
take over the world.
