WEBVTT

03:29.001 --> 03:32.001
Get in there!

03:59.917 --> 04:04.251
Spyglass, this is cobra one. Open bravo South. Over.

04:09.501 --> 04:12.626
You bitches! You bad man!

04:12.959 --> 04:15.376
You got to shoot them in the head!

04:15.376 --> 04:17.666
You torture me... I torture you!

04:35.917 --> 04:37.876
12-hour rotations.

04:37.876 --> 04:40.917
Suicide watch every 3 minutes.

04:41.501 --> 04:45.001
Do not let that repetition lower your guard.

04:45.001 --> 04:48.292
That's exactly what these guys are looking for.

04:48.292 --> 04:49.542
You got to remember...

04:49.542 --> 04:53.459
some of these dudes have been locked up in here for eight years.

04:53.459 --> 04:57.292
They've been in here before some of you were even in high school.

04:57.417 --> 05:01.126
They know the procedure better than you do.

05:01.126 --> 05:05.584
They will test you, and they will best you.

05:06.417 --> 05:11.126
And make no mistake about it... this is a war zone.

05:11.126 --> 05:17.084
Now, they ain't using roadside bombs, and we're not using F-16s.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.834
This is still a war zone.

05:19.834 --> 05:22.376
Now... Some of you might think

05:22.376 --> 05:25.751
you're here to prevent them from leaving.

05:25.751 --> 05:27.751
You're not.

05:27.751 --> 05:32.209
The walls do that for us.

05:32.209 --> 05:37.417
You are here to prevent them from dying.

05:38.501 --> 05:40.084
YES?

05:40.084 --> 05:42.251
Uh, how often do we move the prisoners?

05:42.251 --> 05:44.459
- Detainees. - What?

05:44.459 --> 05:46.792
You will refer to them as "detainees."

05:46.792 --> 05:48.917
You will not call them "prisoners."

05:48.917 --> 05:50.751
You all got that?

05:50.751 --> 05:54.792
No exceptions. De-tai-nees.

05:56.959 --> 06:00.084
Why can't we call them prisoners?

06:00.084 --> 06:03.667
Prisoners are subject to the Geneva convention... detainees are not.

06:03.667 --> 06:05.709
Rec yard is right down there.

06:05.709 --> 06:07.334
Showers are right beside 'em.

06:07.334 --> 06:11.167
Unless they're going to medical, being transferred... that's it.

06:11.167 --> 06:12.751
That's their world.

06:12.751 --> 06:14.709
Is that door shut?

06:14.709 --> 06:16.251
Good.

06:18.209 --> 06:21.834
This... this is your world.

06:21.834 --> 06:24.209
No detainees back here.

06:24.209 --> 06:27.084
On your right, gun Sally.

06:27.084 --> 06:32.001
Remember, on the walk, the only weapon you have is your radio.

06:32.001 --> 06:34.334
Don't be afraid to use it.

06:34.334 --> 06:40.167
Over here, this is our security command or observation...

06:40.167 --> 06:42.834
our eyes and ears on the whole block.

06:42.834 --> 06:46.584
So if you find yourself going up against an uncooperative detainee,

06:46.584 --> 06:49.667
remember you're being watched.

06:49.959 --> 06:54.251
Last but not least, the mess hall.

06:54.251 --> 06:55.792
Like most places on earth,

06:55.792 --> 06:58.792
the chicken fingers are the only thing worth eating.

06:58.792 --> 07:00.917
Hard to fuck those up.

07:00.917 --> 07:03.292
And don't bother telling me the coke's flat

07:03.292 --> 07:05.042
'cause I already fucking know.

07:05.042 --> 07:08.334
Echo one, cobra one, Charlie Bronson. I'll say again.

07:08.334 --> 07:11.167
- Hold on... the natives is getting restless. - Over.

07:11.167 --> 07:12.376
Roger, echo one.

07:12.376 --> 07:14.001
Charlie Bronson, echo one.

07:14.001 --> 07:15.959
Oscar Mike, over.

07:15.959 --> 07:19.667
â€œCharlie Br0ns0n's" our brevity code for an Irf...

07:19.667 --> 07:21.876
that's initial reaction force.

07:21.876 --> 07:26.959
It's a four-man team called in when shit hits the fan on the walk.

07:29.126 --> 07:33.459
Anybody feel like getting their feet wet?

07:48.959 --> 07:53.167
Listen. All you need to worry about is his right hand, okay?

07:53.167 --> 07:55.001
Each of us takes one.

07:55.001 --> 07:57.751
Leg, leg, arm, head.

07:57.751 --> 07:59.626
Don't worry about nothing else.

07:59.626 --> 08:01.334
You just keep your eye on his right hand,

08:01.334 --> 08:02.834
and you gain control of it... got it?

08:02.834 --> 08:04.042
Roger.

08:04.042 --> 08:05.501
And stay behind me.

08:05.501 --> 08:08.917
Let us get the rest of him under control.

08:09.084 --> 08:11.209
Hold up. Hold up.

08:11.209 --> 08:13.376
- No names on the block. - Yeah.

08:13.376 --> 08:14.959
- Okay? - Yeah.

08:14.959 --> 08:16.167
You can talk to'em,

08:16.167 --> 08:19.042
but do not let these guys know anything about you.

08:19.042 --> 08:21.459
Do not let them get inside your head. You got it?

08:21.459 --> 08:23.042
Yeah.

08:24.001 --> 08:26.959
All right, grab our shields. Let's go.

08:45.126 --> 08:47.917
Spyglass, DOD 1-9.

08:47.917 --> 08:49.334
Stay tight.

08:49.334 --> 08:51.209
- Stay tight, all right? - We got this.

08:51.209 --> 08:53.751
Detainee, get back!

08:54.792 --> 08:56.667
Get back, detainee!

08:56.667 --> 08:58.376
Get back!

09:05.667 --> 09:08.709
Get him pinned up. Let's go.

09:09.084 --> 09:10.626
Go!

09:22.209 --> 09:26.209
Come on. Private, give me those cuffs!

09:29.834 --> 09:31.459
Shit!

09:31.459 --> 09:34.584
Get your ass down!

09:45.667 --> 09:47.001
Ohh!

09:47.001 --> 09:48.917
You piece of shit!

09:48.917 --> 09:50.667
Get his arm back!

09:50.792 --> 09:56.292
Get him on... Get down, you piece of shit!

09:56.292 --> 09:58.542
Get his other hand.

09:58.542 --> 10:00.709
Get the fuck up.

10:01.834 --> 10:04.626
Out of here... get him out of here.

10:07.292 --> 10:10.501
That's it... get down.

10:25.084 --> 10:29.417
All right, pull that strap down. You want his hand all the way secure.

10:29.417 --> 10:32.167
Make it as tight as you can. Check his waist.

10:35.292 --> 10:38.209
Check the belt around his waist. Check that side.

10:38.209 --> 10:41.251
We don't want this guy going anywhere on us.

10:41.251 --> 10:44.084
Let's roll him out.

11:04.709 --> 11:07.751
Welcome to gitmo.

11:25.751 --> 11:29.792
Oh, Jackson, did you copy those DVDs for me?

11:29.792 --> 11:31.751
And when exactly was I supposed to do that?

11:31.751 --> 11:33.959
I mean, I had C.O. standing over my shoulder all clay.

11:33.959 --> 11:35.584
Dude, what the fuck?

11:35.584 --> 11:37.792
Johnson is, like, up my ass about getting it back.

11:37.792 --> 11:39.126
Copy that shit for me.

11:39.126 --> 11:41.126
Wait. Don't you got kids, anyway? Why don't you...

11:41.126 --> 11:43.042
- Yeah. - You ass.

11:43.042 --> 11:44.376
So, what... I can't watch porn?

11:44.376 --> 11:46.917
Are you telling me your dad didn't have a stack of nudie mags?

11:46.917 --> 11:49.376
He'd to have something to put over your mom's face.

11:49.376 --> 11:50.834
Oh!

11:50.834 --> 11:52.167
Oh, you're so...

11:52.167 --> 11:54.792
That's cold. That's cold as ice.

11:55.126 --> 11:57.292
You all right?

11:59.626 --> 12:02.709
Yeah. I'm good. Thanks.

12:02.709 --> 12:05.667
Yo, what was that Irf like?

12:07.917 --> 12:09.501
Loud.

12:10.751 --> 12:12.376
Shit.

12:12.376 --> 12:15.084
You didn't think I could handle it?

12:15.084 --> 12:17.834
No, that's not what I'm trying to say.

12:17.834 --> 12:20.542
You know, I just didn't think you'd want to.

12:20.542 --> 12:23.959
I got to say, of all the companies I've rotated through here,

12:23.959 --> 12:27.709
I never had someone get their ticket punched on the first day.

12:28.417 --> 12:31.334
Just be glad it wasn't a shit cocktail.

12:31.334 --> 12:33.667
What's a shit cocktail?

12:33.667 --> 12:36.417
What the fuck do you think that is, Rico?

12:36.417 --> 12:39.251
Hey, Cole, what happened?

12:39.251 --> 12:40.876
Uh.

12:42.459 --> 12:46.042
We... we followed two other guys in, and, um, I was on the left arm.

12:46.042 --> 12:49.126
It was my only thing, and I went...

12:49.126 --> 12:53.292
Pop! She got an elbow right to the lip... knocked her mask clean off.

12:53.292 --> 12:55.667
Ohh, does it hurt?

12:55.667 --> 12:58.459
Yeah, it fucking hurts.

12:58.459 --> 13:01.167
It looks pretty bad. Did medical check it out?

13:01.167 --> 13:02.667
It's fine.

13:02.667 --> 13:05.251
You know what it looks like?

13:05.251 --> 13:07.292
It looks like you got herpes.

13:07.292 --> 13:08.792
Hey, no.

13:08.792 --> 13:11.834
Oh, shit! It kind of does.

13:12.167 --> 13:14.084
- You guys. - No.

13:14.084 --> 13:16.542
You're not gonna get any on the island now, Cole.

13:16.542 --> 13:19.209
Fuck that... I'd hit it, anyway.

13:19.917 --> 13:22.542
What do you say, Cole?

13:24.251 --> 13:28.251
- Well, then, I really would get herpes. - Ohh!

13:29.084 --> 13:30.667
Thank you!

13:30.667 --> 13:32.876
She got you...

13:32.876 --> 13:36.334
Oh, damn. Whoo!

14:05.792 --> 14:08.209
- Mom? - 0h!

14:08.584 --> 14:11.251
<i>Honey, how are you?</i>

14:11.376 --> 14:13.959
Well, things are fine.

14:13.959 --> 14:16.834
Um, the base is real nice.

14:16.834 --> 14:18.667
There's a subway.

14:18.667 --> 14:20.042
<i>A subway?</i>

14:20.042 --> 14:21.626
A subway restaurant, mom.

14:21.626 --> 14:23.167
<i>Oh!</i>

14:23.959 --> 14:26.709
<i>Yeah. And is that your room?</i>

14:26.709 --> 14:29.417
- Yeah. - <i>Can I see it?</i>

14:32.209 --> 14:34.584
How is everything back home, mom?

14:34.584 --> 14:38.126
<i>Oh. Nothing much ever happens back here...</i>

14:38.126 --> 14:43.167
<i>nothing as exciting as what you're doing, I'm sure.</i>

14:43.459 --> 14:46.417
It is what it is. I don't know. I, um...

14:46.417 --> 14:49.292
<i>Honey, you can't just leave him hanging and expect him to</i>

14:49.292 --> 14:51.667
<i>be there when you get back.</i>

14:51.667 --> 14:54.876
I'm not leaving him hanging, and I told you I'm not coming back.

14:54.876 --> 14:57.084
I'm going on another deployment, remember?

14:57.459 --> 14:59.042
<i>All right.</i>

14:59.042 --> 15:01.834
<i>So, how about on the base?</i>

15:01.834 --> 15:03.667
<i>Have you met anyone down there?</i>

15:03.667 --> 15:05.626
Mom, seriously, stop.

15:05.626 --> 15:07.292
I'm not dating an army guy,

15:07.292 --> 15:10.251
and I did not join the military to find a husband.

15:10.251 --> 15:12.084
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

15:12.084 --> 15:13.542
<i>Oh!</i>

15:13.542 --> 15:17.209
<i>Look who wants to say hello.</i>

15:17.209 --> 15:19.209
<i>Say hi, scribbles.</i>

15:19.209 --> 15:22.709
<i>Look who it is!</i>

15:22.709 --> 15:25.709
<i>Say hi, scribbles.</i>

15:34.084 --> 15:38.834
The weather today... bright and sunny.

15:39.209 --> 15:41.042
High of 85...

15:41.042 --> 15:44.584
Tomorrow, there is a chance of rain...

15:45.917 --> 15:47.751
Thank you, private.

15:47.751 --> 15:50.876
Last week...

16:31.084 --> 16:32.709
Come down here.

16:32.709 --> 16:34.709
Make sure you...

16:47.209 --> 16:48.542
Uh...

17:59.292 --> 18:01.751
You want a book?

18:03.709 --> 18:06.001
Do you want a book?

18:09.417 --> 18:11.626
Hey, calm down.

18:11.626 --> 18:13.459
Calm down. Take a step back.

18:13.459 --> 18:15.292
Take one step back from the glass.

18:15.292 --> 18:18.001
- I can't understand what... - Yo, Haji!

18:18.001 --> 18:19.667
Chill the fuck out.

18:19.667 --> 18:21.709
I'll take that book, but you give it to me.

18:21.709 --> 18:23.417
All right, all right. Chill out.

18:23.417 --> 18:25.209
I got this.

18:34.292 --> 18:36.001
Did I do something wrong?

18:36.001 --> 18:39.167
No. These guys just don't like girls.

18:39.167 --> 18:41.792
It's an arab thing.

18:42.209 --> 18:44.667
You want me to take over?

18:44.667 --> 18:47.834
No. It's okay. I can handle it.

18:47.834 --> 18:50.459
All right. Suit yourself.

19:17.917 --> 19:21.209
Do you know those books?

19:24.167 --> 19:25.584
What about them?

19:25.584 --> 19:27.167
Do you like them?

19:27.167 --> 19:30.751
You were watching the books. I'm asking you a question.

19:34.584 --> 19:36.626
What do you want from the cart?

19:36.626 --> 19:40.917
<i>Do you have the new Harry Potter book?</i>

19:44.542 --> 19:47.751
<i>No. This</i> is <i>not the new Harry Potter book.</i>

19:47.751 --> 19:51.084
This is the old one. I already read this one.

19:51.751 --> 19:54.126
I want the last book.

19:54.417 --> 19:56.251
Which one's that?

19:56.251 --> 19:57.709
The last book?

19:57.709 --> 20:00.959
It's, you know... You... you see that book there?

20:00.959 --> 20:03.292
It has no cover on it, huh?

20:03.292 --> 20:04.626
Uh-huh, yes.

20:04.626 --> 20:07.042
That book... it used to have a cover.

20:07.042 --> 20:10.667
I remember I read this cover, you know, when it has a cover on it.

20:10.667 --> 20:14.459
It was saying that <i>Harry Potter,</i> it has seven book, you know?

20:14.459 --> 20:17.167
You guys only have six book.

20:17.167 --> 20:18.209
Huh?

20:18.209 --> 20:19.626
I don't know what to tell you... I...

20:19.626 --> 20:21.542
You know how long I'm asking for this book?

20:21.542 --> 20:24.209
No, you don't. You're new.

20:24.209 --> 20:25.376
Two years.

20:25.376 --> 20:29.626
Imagine, two years I'm asking you guys to give me this last book.

20:29.626 --> 20:31.917
You know what happens at the end of book six?

20:31.917 --> 20:33.626
- No. - No.

20:33.626 --> 20:35.501
- I... - You know, me,

20:35.501 --> 20:39.376
always, always thinking that Snape is a bad guy, okay?

20:39.376 --> 20:42.626
Then I was thinking, no, actually, he is not a bad guy...

20:42.626 --> 20:44.042
he is the good guy.

20:44.042 --> 20:46.084
Then after I read the book six,

20:46.084 --> 20:49.292
- I don't know what to think now. - Do you want this book or not?

20:49.292 --> 20:51.709
You're not listening, huh?

20:51.709 --> 20:53.376
- I read this book... - No, no.

20:53.376 --> 20:54.542
You are not listening to me.

20:54.542 --> 20:55.667
...10 times.

20:55.667 --> 20:57.001
I read this book.

20:57.001 --> 20:58.959
- I want the new book. - I'm telling you we don't have it.

20:58.959 --> 21:01.917
It ain't here. What we have is on the cart.

21:01.917 --> 21:04.084
What do you want?

21:07.459 --> 21:11.334
Give me the "Azkabanâ€œ instead.

21:14.251 --> 21:18.001
Is that one of these arab books?

21:19.917 --> 21:24.542
"Prisoner of Azkaban," book number three.

21:29.834 --> 21:32.084
Yeah.

21:34.834 --> 21:36.417
Here you go.

21:36.417 --> 21:39.376
Hey. What... what... what else do you got?

21:39.376 --> 21:43.084
I got books, and I got newspapers. Use your eyes.

21:43.084 --> 21:44.709
I'm using my eyes.

21:44.709 --> 21:46.792
That newspaper is two months old.

21:46.792 --> 21:49.334
Now, why do I have to know the news for two months old?

21:49.334 --> 21:50.709
So, you're good then?

21:50.709 --> 21:52.709
Hold on your horses, huh?

21:52.709 --> 21:55.126
No one is going nowhere here...

21:55.126 --> 21:57.126
at least, I'm not.

21:57.126 --> 21:59.834
What is that picture?

22:00.376 --> 22:02.459
That book.

22:04.251 --> 22:05.501
No, no! go'

22:05.501 --> 22:07.126
Go, go. Go.

22:07.126 --> 22:08.001
Too much.

22:08.001 --> 22:09.376
Go back.

22:09.376 --> 22:11.126
Uh-huh.

22:13.417 --> 22:15.459
What is it?

22:16.292 --> 22:19.042
"My Antonia."

22:19.501 --> 22:21.876
Is it a good book or...

22:21.876 --> 22:24.001
I don't know. I haven't read it.

22:24.001 --> 22:28.834
Okay. Just tell me what the cover says, on the back.

22:34.001 --> 22:37.167
"In 19th century Nebraska, the spirited daughter of an immigrant..."

22:37.167 --> 22:38.709
Nebraska?

22:38.709 --> 22:41.334
You said... what was it?

22:41.334 --> 22:44.084
It... it's a place in America.

22:44.334 --> 22:46.834
Okay. Uh-huh.

22:46.834 --> 22:49.334
That... what kind of place is this?

22:49.334 --> 22:51.417
Nebraska?

22:53.209 --> 22:54.751
Flat.

22:55.126 --> 22:56.251
Flat.

22:56.251 --> 22:57.667
Time's up.

22:57.667 --> 22:59.042
- Hey. - Keep it moving.

22:59.042 --> 23:01.042
Hey, I... moptop?

23:01.042 --> 23:02.751
Bad timing, okay?

23:03.917 --> 23:06.626
Me and blondie... we were having a very beautiful conversation.

23:06.626 --> 23:07.459
Uh-huh.

23:07.459 --> 23:11.626
And you come here always trying to be a big fucking asshole.

23:11.626 --> 23:12.959
You know what?

23:12.959 --> 23:16.167
I think you guys don't have the lastHar/y Potteron purpose.

23:16.167 --> 23:18.126
You like to drive us crazy.

23:18.126 --> 23:20.459
But I'm not going crazy.

23:20.459 --> 23:24.584
Huh? Happy me. I'm not going crazy... not me!

24:02.584 --> 24:05.417
At 2100, detainees on Charlie block

24:05.417 --> 24:08.084
complained of a foul-smelling odor coming from ventilation.

24:08.084 --> 24:10.292
Maintenance was called.

24:10.292 --> 24:12.626
At 2200, detainee 9-1-2 was found

24:12.626 --> 24:15.292
with seven strings of different colors.

24:15.292 --> 24:19.792
He appeared to be weaving them together, possibly to form a weapon.

24:19.792 --> 24:22.459
At 0500, detainee 4-9 was transferred to

24:22.459 --> 24:24.501
medical for pain in the abdomen.

24:24.501 --> 24:26.917
Diagnosis was constipation.

24:26.917 --> 24:29.584
We have 3-6 moves scheduled, 3-8 moves completed.

24:29.584 --> 24:30.876
All detainees accounted for.

24:30.876 --> 24:33.667
Atten-hut! Honor bound.

24:33.667 --> 24:35.917
To defend freedom.

25:31.542 --> 25:35.084
Hey, blondie,

25:35.084 --> 25:39.376
tell me... how do you like it here so far?

25:42.501 --> 25:44.042
Huh?

25:44.042 --> 25:45.917
Blondie.

25:49.167 --> 25:51.834
Where are you from?

25:54.209 --> 25:57.167
Okay, tell me your name.

25:57.959 --> 25:59.667
No?

26:00.792 --> 26:03.709
My name is Ali...

26:03.709 --> 26:05.917
Ali Amir.

26:06.501 --> 26:10.251
Here, they call me 4-7-1.

26:13.626 --> 26:16.251
You don't like to talk?

26:16.251 --> 26:20.084
Always, it's like that. Why? I don't know why you guys...

26:20.084 --> 26:22.834
you don't like to talk with us.

26:22.834 --> 26:26.251
You and us... we are both stuck here.

26:26.251 --> 26:29.167
It is boring for both of us.

26:29.167 --> 26:32.834
And you and me got nothing to say to each other.

26:33.501 --> 26:36.667
Okay. <i>You don't</i> like <i>to</i> read <i>Harry Potter book?</i>

26:36.667 --> 26:39.084
You don't like to read that book about...

26:39.084 --> 26:41.292
what was that place, the flat place?

26:41.292 --> 26:43.584
Uh, Nebraska?

26:43.917 --> 26:47.709
Tell me what you like to read, huh?

26:48.917 --> 26:51.917
Oh! You are a soldier.

26:51.917 --> 26:55.334
And soldiers... they don't like books.

26:56.542 --> 26:58.917
I thought you only read the Qur'an.

26:58.917 --> 27:01.042
The Qur'an, yes.

27:01.042 --> 27:04.376
We... I-I've read it one million times.

27:04.376 --> 27:05.501
You know what?

27:05.501 --> 27:10.751
Ehan, there in 108... he has memorized it, the whole book.

27:10.751 --> 27:12.126
Hey, Ehan!

27:12.126 --> 27:16.042
Tell something to blondie from the Qur'an.

27:25.542 --> 27:28.042
I think he's trying to tell you to leave me alone.

27:28.042 --> 27:28.917
Ehan!

27:35.251 --> 27:37.001
Hey, blondie.

27:37.001 --> 27:40.251
You know, I read your Bible, too.

27:41.167 --> 27:45.834
My opinion about Bible is the first half of the book...

27:45.834 --> 27:47.251
it is very good.

27:47.417 --> 27:50.417
It has armies, plenty of magic,

27:50.417 --> 27:54.667
which I like very much... things like that.

27:54.667 --> 27:58.959
But, you know, the second half... it has some magic, but not too much.

27:58.959 --> 28:00.792
It is boring.

28:00.792 --> 28:04.501
Well, you don't diss my holy book... I won't diss yours.

28:10.251 --> 28:13.209
So you're Christian?

28:13.709 --> 28:19.042
Tell me something... how did you pick your Christianity?

28:21.501 --> 28:25.042
It was your parents, hmm?

28:25.042 --> 28:27.167
And cut the Hannibal Lecter shit.

28:27.167 --> 28:29.459
Just keep it down.

28:31.126 --> 28:32.792
What?

29:34.126 --> 29:36.542
What is Hannibal Lecter?

29:36.542 --> 29:37.959
I said, keep it down.

29:37.959 --> 29:40.626
Yeah. I'm... I'm trying to understand what you are telling me.

29:40.626 --> 29:43.084
You were saying that stop Hannibal Lecter,

29:43.084 --> 29:46.501
so I have to know what Hannibal Lecter is, then I stop doing that.

29:46.501 --> 29:49.542
He's a guy in a movie that talks too much.

29:49.542 --> 29:52.459
I haven't heard about this movie.

29:52.459 --> 29:56.167
Well, it's probably banned where you're from, anyway.

29:56.167 --> 29:59.251
You mean in Germany?

30:00.292 --> 30:01.376
Huh?

30:01.376 --> 30:03.667
I'm... hey. I'm... hey!

30:03.667 --> 30:06.792
I'm talking with you, blondie!

30:06.792 --> 30:10.792
Okay. I-I-it's... it's no more talking, huh?

30:11.042 --> 30:12.459
Huh?

30:12.459 --> 30:16.626
You are always trying to be all of you assholes.

30:30.667 --> 30:34.542
I don't know how I cannot get one soldier here

30:34.542 --> 30:37.167
who likes to talk about books.

30:40.751 --> 30:45.417
Okay. You don't like to talk. Bring me some water, please.

30:47.917 --> 30:51.167
Blondie. I'm thirsty.

30:52.126 --> 30:54.001
Where's your Qur'an?

30:54.001 --> 30:58.167
Are you giving me some water, please, or not?

30:59.126 --> 31:03.251
Okay, you bring me the water... I stop talking, I promise.

31:18.876 --> 31:22.376
You wouldn't need this if you didn't talk so damn much.

31:24.626 --> 31:26.126
Ah!

31:39.626 --> 31:41.542
Shit.

31:45.292 --> 31:46.709
Shit. Are you all right?

31:46.709 --> 31:48.584
- Oh, man, let me help you. - Motherfucker.

31:48.584 --> 31:50.167
Clean yourself up. We'll take care of this.

31:50.167 --> 31:52.042
Hey, back the fuck up and shut the bean hole.

31:52.042 --> 31:53.876
He's probably got another cocktail.

31:54.376 --> 31:55.709
Oh, fuck.

32:05.209 --> 32:06.792
Quiet down.

32:06.792 --> 32:09.501
4-7-1, take the towel down now.

32:09.501 --> 32:11.209
- Fuck you! - Take it down now!

32:11.209 --> 32:13.209
No, no. We need to call an Irf.

32:14.209 --> 32:15.417
Hold on.

32:15.501 --> 32:17.584
Open that thing.

32:17.584 --> 32:18.584
No, no. No.

32:18.584 --> 32:20.584
- We need to call an Irf. - Calm down.

32:20.584 --> 32:22.459
I'm already covered in his shit! Open it up!

32:22.459 --> 32:24.251
We are not opening the fucking bean hole.

32:24.251 --> 32:27.251
- Now, you need to calm down. - No, we are not opening that up.

32:29.709 --> 32:31.626
You stupid fuckers...Huh?!

32:31.626 --> 32:35.917
I went to university! I know my rights!

32:37.376 --> 32:40.167
Hey, back up, fucker!

32:44.001 --> 32:46.917
Shit. One more time. Open the fucking thing up.

32:46.917 --> 32:48.501
II Fll I

32:48.792 --> 32:50.751
Do it!

32:53.751 --> 32:56.501
Back away from the door.

33:02.001 --> 33:03.751
Nice. Nice, nice. Nice, nice.

33:03.751 --> 33:05.501
Good, good, good, good, good. Good.

33:05.501 --> 33:07.292
Yeah, bitch.

33:07.626 --> 33:10.501
- Nice. -Shit, he's got a second towel.

33:10.501 --> 33:12.251
Seriously?

33:13.876 --> 33:15.376
Fuck.

33:15.376 --> 33:17.292
Shit, man.

33:19.917 --> 33:21.209
Irf him.

33:21.209 --> 33:24.209
You Americans treat us like animals?!

33:24.209 --> 33:26.334
Okay, I am an animal!

33:26.334 --> 33:29.251
Bravo two, code one, Charlie Bronson.

33:33.792 --> 33:36.792
Oh, watch yourselves. If they start covering their Qur'ans,

33:36.792 --> 33:39.417
it means they're gonna start throwing shit around!

33:39.667 --> 33:41.292
You don't read anything!

33:41.292 --> 33:43.584
I read book! I read history!

33:43.584 --> 33:45.917
I can't win!

33:51.376 --> 33:53.959
<i>Hi'. Xrfl M'.!</i>

34:18.208 --> 34:20.167
Cocktail?

34:20.958 --> 34:22.876
Sir, yes, sir.

34:22.876 --> 34:24.751
At ease.

34:25.833 --> 34:28.917
Did medical check you out yet?

34:29.251 --> 34:32.001
Yes, sir. I'm fine.

34:39.167 --> 34:43.208
Why don't you, uh, take it easy for the rest of the shift?

34:43.208 --> 34:47.208
See if observation needs any help.

34:47.626 --> 34:50.542
Thank you, sir. I'm fine.

34:54.292 --> 34:58.542
Use the vinegar. It helps with the smell.

35:14.876 --> 35:16.751
Hey.

35:16.751 --> 35:20.001
Mmm. Cole, you smell amazing.

35:20.001 --> 35:22.584
What's that you're wearing... chanel no. 2?

35:22.584 --> 35:24.209
Mm-hmm.

35:24.209 --> 35:26.292
You better watch yourself with those.

35:26.292 --> 35:28.292
They drug them to keep them docile.

35:28.292 --> 35:30.917
Shit. No, they don't.

35:31.459 --> 35:34.459
Hey. What are you doing here? Did medical check you out?

35:34.459 --> 35:35.501
I'm fine.

35:35.501 --> 35:37.876
We're short a meal, though. Do you mind grabbing one?

35:37.876 --> 35:39.167
No, we're not.

35:39.167 --> 35:42.459
Your pal 471... he's not coming back today.

35:42.459 --> 35:43.626
Why?

35:43.626 --> 35:46.251
- I sent him on a flyer. What's that?

35:46.251 --> 35:48.376
Our frequent flyer program.

35:48.376 --> 35:51.459
We move him from cell to cell every two hours.

35:51.459 --> 35:55.667
Night shift won't like it, but fuck 'em. Dude's got to learn somehow.

35:55.667 --> 35:57.834
You move him all night long?

35:57.834 --> 35:59.751
All night, all clay, all week.

35:59.751 --> 36:01.459
How does he sleep?

36:01.459 --> 36:04.167
He doesn't, dummy... that's the point.

36:04.167 --> 36:07.042
Come on, get this shit moving. We're on a schedule.

36:07.042 --> 36:08.376
It's brutal.

36:08.709 --> 36:10.709
What are you... the red cross?

36:10.709 --> 36:12.959
No, I'm just saying. It's...Brutal.

36:12.959 --> 36:15.126
I mean, Jesus, Rico, Cole just got shit flung at her face.

36:15.126 --> 36:16.042
Are you cool with that?

36:16.042 --> 36:17.126
Of course not.

36:17.126 --> 36:20.459
I mean, you don't have to do some big thing over me. I'm... I'm fine.

36:20.459 --> 36:21.959
Yeah, we kind of do.

36:21.959 --> 36:23.667
And just so we're clear, I'm down with it.

36:23.667 --> 36:26.959
I just think, you know, it's kind of hard-core, right?

36:28.292 --> 36:30.792
You want me to call it off?

36:31.876 --> 36:34.417
No. Fuck him.

36:43.626 --> 36:46.501
Look at you pussies swim!

36:46.501 --> 36:49.292
Rico, get the ladder.

36:49.542 --> 36:51.584
Pull the ladder up.

36:51.584 --> 36:53.626
P We bail haters gonna hate, but... <i>P</i>

36:53.626 --> 36:57.126
What do you get to be swimming there for?

36:57.126 --> 36:59.126
Swim, flounder.

37:01.334 --> 37:03.167
To good times, baby. To good times.

37:03.167 --> 37:04.792
Yeah, yeah, good times, baby.

37:04.792 --> 37:07.001
P I love when the... P

37:07.001 --> 37:10.126
<i>P</i> Got a million, now I'm about to add six more... P

37:10.417 --> 37:11.876
Well, I'll be damned...

37:11.876 --> 37:13.959
Cole the fisherman.

37:16.251 --> 37:17.667
Be careful there.

37:17.667 --> 37:19.709
You want me to bait it for you?

37:20.792 --> 37:23.584
No, I think I'm pretty good. Thanks.

37:23.584 --> 37:25.167
It's a treble hook.

37:25.167 --> 37:28.417
I don't want you to cut your, uh, finger there.

37:28.417 --> 37:30.501
You got to make sure you get it on all three.

37:30.501 --> 37:32.001
Like that?

37:33.251 --> 37:34.501
Not bad.

37:34.501 --> 37:36.292
Hey, give me this shit.

01:03:18.542 --> 01:03:22.542
I didn't demand this... mahmoud did.

01:03:23.459 --> 01:03:26.001
Why'd he demand it?

01:03:26.251 --> 01:03:28.667
I don't know. Go ask Mahmoud.

01:03:28.667 --> 01:03:31.834
Maybe because he's an asshole?

01:03:46.334 --> 01:03:48.459
So what's the count today?

01:03:48.459 --> 01:03:52.751
Oh. I've only gotten to 12 kicks today.

01:03:52.751 --> 01:03:55.542
Do you know what I hear today?

01:03:55.542 --> 01:03:59.709
Well, someone says sabir in "A" block... they said he hit

01:03:59.709 --> 01:04:01.667
40 last week.

01:04:01.667 --> 01:04:04.042
- 40? - Yeah. That's what they say.

01:04:04.042 --> 01:04:06.001
I don't know. I'm not so sure 'cause,

01:04:06.001 --> 01:04:08.084
well, no one has seen this, you know...

01:04:08.084 --> 01:04:12.251
only the guards, and those guards... they wouldn't say.

01:04:14.751 --> 01:04:16.667
You think you can beat 40?

01:04:16.667 --> 01:04:18.001
I don't know.

01:04:18.001 --> 01:04:21.751
I still think that he's made this up, you know.

01:04:27.751 --> 01:04:31.667
I tell you what... you beat 40, I'll vouch for you.

01:04:33.001 --> 01:04:34.292
Yeah?

01:04:34.292 --> 01:04:35.792
Yeah.

01:04:36.334 --> 01:04:37.792
Okay.

01:04:39.667 --> 01:04:42.876
2...3...4...5...

01:04:42.876 --> 01:04:45.376
6...7...8...

01:04:49.709 --> 01:04:52.751
You're a long way away from 40.

01:04:52.751 --> 01:04:54.584
- What was that? - 8.

01:04:54.584 --> 01:04:56.001
Are you sure?

01:04:56.001 --> 01:04:58.792
- Wasn't that 48? - I'm sure.

01:04:58.792 --> 01:05:01.292
- You saw 48. - I didn't.

01:05:01.292 --> 01:05:02.876
I mean, come on.

01:05:02.876 --> 01:05:05.626
Those guys... they don't believe you, anyway.

01:05:05.626 --> 01:05:08.376
Not gonna lie for you.

01:05:17.376 --> 01:05:20.667
You know, compliant detainees get to play on a real field together?

01:05:20.667 --> 01:05:23.376
Uh-huh. They are lucky.

01:05:25.709 --> 01:05:28.584
If you stop acting up, they'll transfer you.

01:05:28.584 --> 01:05:31.667
- You know that, right? - Mm-hmm.

01:05:36.501 --> 01:05:39.376
And you don't care?

01:05:41.209 --> 01:05:44.459
It's those guys who don't care, blondie.

01:05:44.459 --> 01:05:46.834
You know, they don't care about anything,

01:05:46.834 --> 01:05:49.417
just the things that make their life easier.

01:05:49.417 --> 01:05:53.042
You guys always say, "follow these rules...

01:05:53.042 --> 01:05:55.792
we will let you watch TV," huh?

01:05:55.792 --> 01:05:59.417
But if I follow your rules, what does it means?

01:05:59.417 --> 01:06:00.959
It means that I'm agreeing that

01:06:00.959 --> 01:06:03.042
you have the right to give me rules, huh?

01:06:03.042 --> 01:06:04.751
Well, you don't.

01:06:04.751 --> 01:06:07.459
You don't have the right to give me rules.

01:06:07.751 --> 01:06:09.209
So, me...

01:06:09.209 --> 01:06:12.709
I never agree to follow your rules...

01:06:12.709 --> 01:06:14.751
Never.

01:06:16.459 --> 01:06:19.209
You know, maybe you think I'm stupid for this.

01:06:19.209 --> 01:06:23.251
- No, you're not stupid. - No. I mean, maybe you're right, but...

01:06:29.834 --> 01:06:32.792
You're definitely not stupid.

01:06:32.792 --> 01:06:35.626
You went to university.

01:06:36.792 --> 01:06:39.417
You're making fun of me, huh?

01:06:39.417 --> 01:06:42.751
Yeah, you're making fun... you're laughing at me, huh?

01:06:42.751 --> 01:06:46.626
Come on. Look at you. You're laughing at me, huh?

01:06:56.376 --> 01:06:59.376
- What's that about? - Nothing.

01:07:00.376 --> 01:07:03.876
They don't like you talking to me, huh?

01:07:04.292 --> 01:07:06.501
Private...

01:07:07.167 --> 01:07:09.251
Get over here.

01:07:09.251 --> 01:07:12.209
Neither do they, huh?

01:07:15.709 --> 01:07:18.042
Yes, Corporal?

01:07:18.751 --> 01:07:22.084
What were you just talking about over there?

01:07:22.292 --> 01:07:23.667
With Ali?

01:07:23.667 --> 01:07:27.376
No, with detainee 471.

01:07:28.876 --> 01:07:31.084
- Nothing. - Uh-huh. All right.

01:07:31.084 --> 01:07:33.376
Well, if you ain't talking about nothing,

01:07:33.376 --> 01:07:35.751
then you don't need to be talking, right?

01:07:35.751 --> 01:07:37.167
Hey!

01:07:37.501 --> 01:07:41.334
Hey, I did 20 kicks! Hey! I did 20 kicks!

01:07:41.334 --> 01:07:45.209
Did you see that, blondie? I swear I did 20!

01:07:45.209 --> 01:07:47.876
I swear I did!

01:07:48.292 --> 01:07:50.917
I'm gonna need your help on the showers today.

01:07:50.917 --> 01:07:52.751
The showers?

01:07:52.751 --> 01:07:56.542
I know you don't want to, but all my extra men are dealing

01:07:56.542 --> 01:07:58.626
with some dickhead in delta pod that

01:07:58.626 --> 01:08:01.001
decided to cover his entire cell in poop.

01:08:01.001 --> 01:08:03.292
I can't work showers. They won't even look me in the eye.

01:08:03.292 --> 01:08:06.084
- They think they're gonna shower? - Well, that's their problem.

01:08:06.084 --> 01:08:09.626
I mean, at least it'll speed things up.

01:08:10.626 --> 01:08:15.042
- S.O.P. Clearly states we are not... - I know what S.O.P. Says.

01:08:15.959 --> 01:08:18.709
What's the matter? Can't handle it?

01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:21.292
You want me to get one of my other guys,

01:08:21.292 --> 01:08:24.417
pull him away from doing whatever the hell he's doing,

01:08:24.417 --> 01:08:25.876
so he can do it for you?

01:08:29.001 --> 01:08:30.751
No.

01:08:42.501 --> 01:08:46.001
Forget her. Get your ass in there.

01:08:49.084 --> 01:08:50.542
Let's go, Skippy-

01:08:50.542 --> 01:08:53.167
Get undressed. Clock's ticking.

01:08:59.376 --> 01:09:01.626
Get your pants off.

01:09:12.334 --> 01:09:14.167
And shorts off.

01:09:14.501 --> 01:09:16.167
Come on.

01:09:16.167 --> 01:09:19.292
Get your fucking shorts off.

01:09:20.417 --> 01:09:21.959
Get your fucking shorts off,

01:09:21.959 --> 01:09:25.751
or I'll call in an Irf and we'll get them to take them off for you.

01:09:25.751 --> 01:09:28.417
Get them off.

01:09:48.917 --> 01:09:52.417
You guarding the fence, or you guarding him?

01:09:53.709 --> 01:09:56.959
This is completely out of line.

01:09:56.959 --> 01:09:58.626
Let me ask you something...

01:09:58.626 --> 01:10:01.376
are you a soldier, or are you a female soldier?

01:10:01.376 --> 01:10:04.001
'Cause I don't have these kind of problems with soldiers.

01:10:04.001 --> 01:10:07.292
You got to watch him. That's your job.

01:10:13.751 --> 01:10:15.959
Look at him.

01:10:43.709 --> 01:10:46.459
Hey, Cole, I thought that was you.

01:10:46.459 --> 01:10:48.126
What are you doing back here?

01:10:48.126 --> 01:10:51.084
- Drinking. - No shit.

01:10:52.334 --> 01:10:55.709
What's wrong? You had a bad clay or something?

01:10:56.167 --> 01:10:58.917
Not particularly.

01:10:59.376 --> 01:11:02.459
Not as bad as yours, I hear.

01:11:03.042 --> 01:11:05.709
What do you mean?

01:11:06.959 --> 01:11:11.917
I heard some detainee just covered his cell on feces.

01:11:11.917 --> 01:11:14.001
Probably wasn't fun.

01:11:14.001 --> 01:11:15.459
When... today?

01:11:15.459 --> 01:11:17.209
On delta pod?

01:11:17.209 --> 01:11:19.084
No, it was just pretty quiet all day.

01:11:19.084 --> 01:11:20.626
Yeah.

01:11:23.751 --> 01:11:25.209
Must have been another pod.

01:11:25.209 --> 01:11:27.584
No, nothing like that happened on any of the pods.

01:11:27.584 --> 01:11:29.959
If it did, I would've saw it.

01:11:31.417 --> 01:11:33.376
Come in, boys! It's shot time!

01:11:33.376 --> 01:11:36.501
That's what I'm talking about! Oh, hey.

01:11:39.126 --> 01:11:40.709
What do you want?

01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:43.417
Jackie Chan got one.

01:12:01.959 --> 01:12:03.959
Shh! Shh!

01:12:05.501 --> 01:12:09.876
I'm not following you here.

01:12:50.584 --> 01:12:58.751
[ Soldiers shouting cadences in distance ]

01:13:03.126 --> 01:13:06.667
Private first class Cole reporting as ordered, sir.

01:13:06.667 --> 01:13:09.167
At ease.

01:13:09.167 --> 01:13:12.542
Have a seat, private.

01:13:20.667 --> 01:13:22.626
Candy?

01:13:24.876 --> 01:13:27.792
No, thank you, sir.

01:13:30.459 --> 01:13:35.292
I've read your report. I've also spoken to corporal ransdell.

01:13:45.042 --> 01:13:47.709
In your report, you say that you were...

01:13:47.709 --> 01:13:51.751
...escorting a detainee to the showers after rec... is that correct?

01:13:51.751 --> 01:13:53.251
Affirmative.

01:13:53.251 --> 01:13:57.251
And you filed the report because this was uncomfortable.

01:13:57.501 --> 01:14:02.251
Well... No, I-it made him uncomfortable.

01:14:03.042 --> 01:14:06.042
- Who? - The detainee.

01:14:06.876 --> 01:14:10.042
So you filed against a fellow soldier

01:14:10.042 --> 01:14:13.334
because the detainee was uncomfortable?

01:14:14.209 --> 01:14:18.584
It was not the proper way to treat him, sir.

01:14:18.584 --> 01:14:22.001
Did the detainee take a shower?

01:14:22.001 --> 01:14:23.709
Yes, sir.

01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:27.334
Sounds like he wasn't that uncomfortable with it, then.

01:14:29.251 --> 01:14:32.542
It was a blatant violation of standard operating procedure,

01:14:32.542 --> 01:14:34.751
which is why I filed the report.

01:14:34.751 --> 01:14:37.584
Since you knew what was happening was against S.O.P.,

01:14:37.584 --> 01:14:40.542
what exactly were you doing there?

01:14:40.542 --> 01:14:43.501
I was ordered to be there, sir.

01:14:43.501 --> 01:14:47.542
Corporal ransdell gave you a direct order?

01:14:47.542 --> 01:14:50.501
He had lied about being shorthanded.

01:14:50.501 --> 01:14:53.251
Did he order you, or did he lie to you?

01:14:53.251 --> 01:14:54.251
Sir...

01:14:54.251 --> 01:14:56.334
'Cause it seems to me there'd be no point to lie to you

01:14:56.334 --> 01:14:57.334
if he simply ordered you.

01:14:57.334 --> 01:15:00.959
- He... he... - And there's nothing going on?

01:15:03.126 --> 01:15:07.292
You don't have a personal relationship with him,

01:15:07.292 --> 01:15:12.001
nothing going on outside the wire?

01:15:12.959 --> 01:15:14.792
No, sir.

01:15:15.209 --> 01:15:18.584
Is that what he told you?

01:15:22.001 --> 01:15:25.292
4-7-1, the detainee...

01:15:25.292 --> 01:15:28.167
you two are friends.

01:15:29.876 --> 01:15:31.667
No, sir.

01:15:31.667 --> 01:15:34.751
You're not friendly with him?

01:15:35.501 --> 01:15:39.542
- No, sir. - You don't talk to him?

01:15:41.126 --> 01:15:42.917
We have spoken.

01:15:42.917 --> 01:15:46.417
I am...Not...

01:15:47.667 --> 01:15:49.834
I...

01:15:51.084 --> 01:15:54.209
- Like I said in my report... - I've read your report.

01:15:54.209 --> 01:15:55.959
I know what it says.

01:15:55.959 --> 01:15:58.292
I also know what corporal ransdell says about it.

01:15:58.292 --> 01:16:01.542
But what I don't know and will probably never know is

01:16:01.542 --> 01:16:03.292
what is really going on here.

01:16:07.251 --> 01:16:10.751
Do you like it here, son?

01:16:11.501 --> 01:16:12.834
Sir?

01:16:12.834 --> 01:16:14.792
Do you like it here...

01:16:14.792 --> 01:16:17.542
In Guantanamo bay?

01:16:20.084 --> 01:16:21.667
Yes, sir.

01:16:21.667 --> 01:16:23.292
It's fine.

01:16:23.292 --> 01:16:25.084
I hate it.

01:16:25.667 --> 01:16:29.251
This ain't the kind of post a guy makes his stars on.

01:16:30.042 --> 01:16:32.751
Nobody gives you a medal when you do it right...

01:16:32.751 --> 01:16:36.417
they just give you a demotion when you do it wrong.

01:16:36.417 --> 01:16:40.709
My granddad... he flew 25 missions over Germany,

01:16:40.709 --> 01:16:43.667
blew up a dozen Nazi installments.

01:16:43.667 --> 01:16:45.917
What do we get?

01:16:45.917 --> 01:16:50.126
We get to babysit a bunch of sheep farmers.

01:16:50.709 --> 01:16:54.376
Like I said, I hate it here, and, yet, here I am.

01:16:54.376 --> 01:16:57.667
And do you know why?

01:16:57.667 --> 01:17:03.209
I'm here because my commanding officer told me to come here.

01:17:07.167 --> 01:17:09.292
Yes, sir.

01:17:11.084 --> 01:17:16.626
The review board will have, uh, a hearing for both of you next month.

01:17:18.042 --> 01:17:21.542
- I didn't do... - You're dismissed.

01:17:24.167 --> 01:17:25.917
Yes, sir.

01:17:25.917 --> 01:17:28.251
Good morning, sir.

01:17:30.792 --> 01:17:33.167
- Hey. - Hey.

01:17:36.959 --> 01:17:39.876
How's your Enchilada?

01:17:40.334 --> 01:17:43.251
It's about as good as it looks.

01:17:43.251 --> 01:17:45.251
I should have went with the chicken fingers.

01:17:45.251 --> 01:17:47.751
Hard to mess those up, right?

01:17:53.667 --> 01:17:56.959
Hear about what happened on delta pod?

01:17:58.459 --> 01:18:01.084
What? Another cocktail?

01:18:01.084 --> 01:18:05.376
No. A dude tried to hang himself last night.

01:18:05.376 --> 01:18:07.251
How?

01:18:07.251 --> 01:18:10.667
It's not even possible. We watch these guys 24-7.

01:18:10.667 --> 01:18:13.209
No, not a detainee.

01:18:13.209 --> 01:18:17.001
It was a... it was a guard.

01:18:19.709 --> 01:18:23.167
The dude tied himself off to a ceiling fan and... get this...

01:18:23.167 --> 01:18:25.376
the piece of shit pulled out of the wall.

01:18:25.376 --> 01:18:27.792
Can you believe that shit?

01:18:27.792 --> 01:18:31.667
The dude's life got saved by shitty army contractors.

01:18:31.667 --> 01:18:33.917
It's funny, right?

01:18:33.917 --> 01:18:35.917
He's lucky.

01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:38.584
It's crazy though, right...

01:18:38.584 --> 01:18:40.584
that he tried to kill himself?

01:18:40.584 --> 01:18:42.709
I mean, I get it. It's a tough mission, you know.

01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:44.334
But what the fuck, man?

01:18:44.334 --> 01:18:47.126
It's our fucking job. You got to get over it, you know?

01:18:47.126 --> 01:18:49.126
Yeah.

01:18:51.417 --> 01:18:55.209
I know. It's got to be hard for some people, though.

01:18:55.209 --> 01:18:57.334
It's...

01:18:58.459 --> 01:19:03.042
It's not as black and white as they said it was gonna be.

01:19:03.042 --> 01:19:05.751
What's that mean?

01:19:05.917 --> 01:19:09.626
I don't know what he was expecting, but I'm sure it wasn't this.

01:19:09.626 --> 01:19:12.584
Come on, though. It's not as bad as that.

01:19:12.584 --> 01:19:14.834
A lot of these guys aren't even that tough.

01:19:14.834 --> 01:19:16.459
Exactly.

01:19:16.459 --> 01:19:18.709
Makes you feel fucking guilty. It's like...

01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:20.959
Guilty? Come... what the fuck you got to feel guilty for?

01:19:20.959 --> 01:19:22.876
No, man. Hell, you shouldn't feel guilty about shit.

01:19:22.876 --> 01:19:27.334
These motherfuckers did 9/11, and now they're in jail... end of story.

01:19:27.334 --> 01:19:31.292
The motherfuckers that did 9/11 died there.

01:19:32.876 --> 01:19:35.167
You know what your problem is?

01:19:35.167 --> 01:19:37.459
You've been talking too much to the fucking translators.

01:19:37.459 --> 01:19:38.917
They've gotten all in your head,

01:19:38.917 --> 01:19:41.001
and you've forgotten how lucky you really are.

01:19:41.001 --> 01:19:43.126
We could be in Iraq right now.

01:19:43.126 --> 01:19:44.792
You realize that?

01:19:44.792 --> 01:19:48.917
I mean, you'd rather be dodging cocktails than bullets, right?

01:19:51.334 --> 01:19:53.084
No.

01:19:53.876 --> 01:19:56.292
Whatever.

01:19:56.292 --> 01:19:58.626
10 minutes, faggots.

01:19:58.626 --> 01:20:01.501
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

01:20:07.709 --> 01:20:10.709
Hey...You smoke now?

01:20:11.167 --> 01:20:12.834
Yeah.

01:20:21.876 --> 01:20:24.876
What are you gonna do, Cole?

01:20:24.876 --> 01:20:27.376
Tell on it?

01:21:24.959 --> 01:21:29.126
Based on the detainees' preferences...

01:22:52.751 --> 01:22:54.292
Yo.

01:22:56.001 --> 01:22:58.792
- What's up? - Here you go.

01:22:58.792 --> 01:23:00.959
You've been transferred.

01:23:00.959 --> 01:23:03.876
What? Where?

01:23:07.209 --> 01:23:08.751
Night shift.

01:23:08.751 --> 01:23:09.792
Yeah.

01:23:09.792 --> 01:23:13.001
Just, uh, skip tomorrow. Rotate in on the next.

01:23:13.001 --> 01:23:15.876
Your new O.I.C. Will come get you. It's all there.

01:23:15.876 --> 01:23:18.751
Why?

01:23:18.751 --> 01:23:22.459
Shit, Cole. You know ain't no why in the army.

01:23:49.001 --> 01:23:50.584
Hey. HEY-

01:23:50.584 --> 01:23:53.209
Is that clock right?

01:23:53.459 --> 01:23:55.376
Yeah.

01:23:56.501 --> 01:24:00.459
So...W-where is blondie?

01:24:01.084 --> 01:24:02.667
Huh?

01:24:23.417 --> 01:24:26.626
Detainee 1-0-8 was heard singing a song in Arabic

01:24:26.626 --> 01:24:29.626
that had the English words "bin laden" in it.

01:24:29.626 --> 01:24:34.917
At 1700 hours, detainee 9-1 complained that his chow smelled rotten.

01:24:34.917 --> 01:24:38.667
He was given another meal, which he said tasted bad.

01:24:38.667 --> 01:24:43.542
At 1900, detainee 2-3-5 was given a water bottle.

01:24:43.542 --> 01:24:45.834
He drank it, asked for another,

01:24:45.834 --> 01:24:49.709
and proceeded to drink six more bottles in the span of five minutes.

01:24:49.709 --> 01:24:53.334
He then complained of feeling bad.

01:24:53.334 --> 01:24:58.501
We had 2-5 moves scheduled, 2-8 moves completed.

01:24:59.501 --> 01:25:02.084
Atten-hut!

01:25:02.084 --> 01:25:03.542
Honor bound.

01:25:03.542 --> 01:25:05.709
To defend freedom.

01:25:40.292 --> 01:25:42.709
Blondie?

01:25:43.751 --> 01:25:46.167
Blondie?

01:25:46.959 --> 01:25:49.542
It is you.

01:25:51.209 --> 01:25:54.126
Hey, don't... don't get up. Go back to sleep.

01:25:54.126 --> 01:25:56.792
No. No. No. I..I...I...

01:25:56.792 --> 01:25:58.626
I can never sleep well...

01:25:58.626 --> 01:26:00.459
you know, here, anyway.

01:26:00.459 --> 01:26:03.709
I didn't... I didn't know they kept the lights on all night.

01:26:03.709 --> 01:26:06.209
All clay and all night.

01:26:06.209 --> 01:26:08.959
How is it that you're here?

01:26:08.959 --> 01:26:12.709
I mean, uh, you're a night guard.

01:26:14.292 --> 01:26:17.751
Oh. Um, I'm sorry.

01:26:17.751 --> 01:26:20.376
You cannot say. I-It's okay.

01:26:20.376 --> 01:26:24.167
No. Actually, uh...

01:26:26.084 --> 01:26:28.584
...I snitched on someone.

01:26:28.584 --> 01:26:31.126
What... what... what is it... snitch?

01:26:31.126 --> 01:26:34.001
It's like golden snitch and...

01:26:34.292 --> 01:26:35.626
No.

01:26:35.626 --> 01:26:40.501
Um, to snitch on someone is,

01:26:40.501 --> 01:26:42.834
uh...It's to tell... like,

01:26:42.834 --> 01:26:47.167
if someone does something wrong, you turn them in.

01:26:50.042 --> 01:26:53.792
Who... who did you snitch on?

01:26:56.876 --> 01:26:59.292
I can't say.

01:26:59.292 --> 01:27:01.959
It's moptop, huh?

01:27:03.459 --> 01:27:06.834
What... what did he do to you?

01:27:09.584 --> 01:27:13.917
You should get some sleep. See you later.

01:27:35.417 --> 01:27:38.584
I'm not gonna tell you what he did.

01:27:38.584 --> 01:27:40.376
Okay.

01:27:42.584 --> 01:27:47.126
So, tell me this one... how did you end up here?

01:27:48.626 --> 01:27:51.084
I told you... they reassigned me.

01:27:51.084 --> 01:27:52.459
No, no.

01:27:52.459 --> 01:27:56.251
How did you end up here in this place?

01:28:00.584 --> 01:28:03.334
How did you end up here?

01:28:03.334 --> 01:28:05.251
Me?

01:28:06.792 --> 01:28:10.292
How did I end up here?

01:28:13.834 --> 01:28:21.292
I could tell you that I was not with Al-Qaeda or a terrorist or...

01:28:21.292 --> 01:28:23.834
you wouldn't believe me, anyway.

01:28:23.834 --> 01:28:27.209
Nobody believes me here.

01:28:32.251 --> 01:28:36.126
So you're from Germany?

01:28:36.542 --> 01:28:37.834
Yeah.

01:28:37.834 --> 01:28:39.917
You remember.

01:28:39.917 --> 01:28:41.709
Yeah.

01:28:41.709 --> 01:28:44.251
Yeah. Yeah.

01:28:44.584 --> 01:28:46.459
From Germany, yeah.

01:28:46.459 --> 01:28:50.292
Actually, I was, you know, from Bremen.

01:28:50.292 --> 01:28:52.292
Do you know the city... Bremen?

01:28:52.292 --> 01:28:54.167
Bremen?

01:28:54.459 --> 01:28:57.917
- You don't know? - No. I can't even say it.

01:28:57.917 --> 01:29:01.251
H u h ? <i>Sprechen Sie Deutsch ?</i>

01:29:01.251 --> 01:29:04.209
- No speakDeutsch? - Mm, Dutch?

01:29:04.209 --> 01:29:06.084
- What? - <i>Ne/n.</i>

01:29:06.084 --> 01:29:07.709
Um, no.

01:29:07.709 --> 01:29:11.584
Have you been in Germany before?

01:29:12.584 --> 01:29:13.667
No?

01:29:13.667 --> 01:29:15.167
- No. - No.

01:29:15.167 --> 01:29:19.459
No. I'd like to... plan to.

01:29:19.459 --> 01:29:23.292
So, tell me... where have you been?

01:29:26.751 --> 01:29:30.834
I mean, you're... you're probably gonna laugh.

01:29:30.834 --> 01:29:33.084
Me? Laugh? No.

01:29:33.084 --> 01:29:34.626
At you?

01:29:34.626 --> 01:29:37.667
Uh, I..I never laugh at you.

01:29:40.876 --> 01:29:43.667
This is my first time out of the country...

01:29:43.667 --> 01:29:45.667
I mean, it's pretty lame, right?

01:29:45.667 --> 01:29:47.334
No.

01:29:47.334 --> 01:29:48.959
No, it's not.

01:29:48.959 --> 01:29:51.917
It's... you're... you're young.

01:29:51.917 --> 01:29:55.917
You're very young, and you're... you're a beginner, huh?

01:29:55.917 --> 01:29:57.917
Yeah.

01:29:58.917 --> 01:30:02.917
There are more people on this base than in my hometown.

01:30:02.917 --> 01:30:04.417
Small, huh?

01:30:04.417 --> 01:30:08.292
Yeah, tiny... gets smaller every day.

01:30:08.292 --> 01:30:12.292
And is this the reason that you came here?

01:30:12.292 --> 01:30:14.959
Part of it, yeah.

01:30:15.459 --> 01:30:18.501
What is the other part?

01:30:19.667 --> 01:30:22.251
A lot of reasons. Um...

01:30:29.626 --> 01:30:33.251
I wanted to do something.

01:30:33.251 --> 01:30:35.917
You know, I...

01:30:35.917 --> 01:30:40.084
I wanted to do something important.

01:30:43.667 --> 01:30:45.792
Yeah.

01:30:50.251 --> 01:30:53.126
I understand.

01:31:47.626 --> 01:31:49.292
Hey.

01:31:51.167 --> 01:31:53.584
Thank you.

01:31:54.542 --> 01:31:57.042
It's hard making the switch, huh?

01:31:57.042 --> 01:31:58.667
Yeah, it's all right.

01:31:58.667 --> 01:32:01.042
It takes a few days.

01:32:01.501 --> 01:32:07.001
Of course, uh, you won't be a night owl for... for too long, right?

01:32:07.001 --> 01:32:09.251
I guess not.

01:32:09.251 --> 01:32:11.251
Or...

01:32:12.417 --> 01:32:14.792
I hated the clay shift...

01:32:14.792 --> 01:32:18.542
bunch of detainees chatting your ear off.

01:32:19.792 --> 01:32:22.917
I'd hate that.

01:32:28.126 --> 01:32:31.751
Thanks for the coffee.

01:32:42.917 --> 01:32:47.084
Hey. Are you still awake?

01:32:50.667 --> 01:32:53.917
What day is today?

01:32:53.917 --> 01:32:56.209
Wednesday.

01:32:56.209 --> 01:33:00.042
No, what date is today?

01:33:00.042 --> 01:33:03.709
Um, July 14th.

01:33:06.751 --> 01:33:10.626
So you're leaving next month?

01:33:11.542 --> 01:33:13.501
Yeah.

01:33:13.501 --> 01:33:15.917
How'd you know that?

01:33:15.917 --> 01:33:21.084
They always change the guards in August.

01:33:29.251 --> 01:33:34.751
So, when... when you leave, will you sign up again here?

01:33:34.751 --> 01:33:40.376
Like, you know, there are guards here that have been for many years.

01:33:42.001 --> 01:33:44.876
No, I don't think so.

01:33:53.834 --> 01:33:59.167
So you want to go to your home, your... your small town?

01:33:59.167 --> 01:34:01.459
No.

01:34:05.542 --> 01:34:09.542
What do you want to do, then?

01:34:12.376 --> 01:34:14.542
I don't know yet.

01:34:14.542 --> 01:34:17.626
Travel, maybe.

01:34:17.626 --> 01:34:20.501
Go to Bremen.

01:34:22.917 --> 01:34:26.417
I don't like this month.

01:34:29.417 --> 01:34:33.376
Always these new guards...

01:34:33.376 --> 01:34:38.001
Treating us like very bad guys.

01:34:41.459 --> 01:34:45.334
They'll learn...Like I did.

01:34:50.417 --> 01:34:53.376
What did you learn?

01:34:58.876 --> 01:35:00.834
Huh?

01:35:01.251 --> 01:35:03.292
Tell me.

01:35:05.959 --> 01:35:10.417
You must learn something, huh, when I throw that shit on you...

01:35:10.417 --> 01:35:13.417
you learned something, huh?

01:35:13.417 --> 01:35:17.459
Or when we're trying to kill ourselves here,

01:35:17.459 --> 01:35:21.042
with hunger strike, you learned something.. Huh? You said.

01:35:21.042 --> 01:35:22.834
So tell me... what is that?

01:35:22.834 --> 01:35:26.001
I want to know. What did you learn?

01:35:31.501 --> 01:35:35.792
Only you think you know, but you know nothing.

01:35:36.542 --> 01:35:40.001
You know nothing about me.

01:35:41.834 --> 01:35:44.667
You and me...

01:35:47.917 --> 01:35:50.584
We are at war.

01:35:53.126 --> 01:35:55.917
I don't see it like that.

01:35:57.209 --> 01:36:00.292
Then you see nothing.

01:37:07.709 --> 01:37:09.709
What is that?

01:37:09.709 --> 01:37:11.584
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:37:11.584 --> 01:37:15.001
If... if you call on your radio, you're not going to make it.

01:37:16.292 --> 01:37:18.751
You're not going to make it.

01:37:18.751 --> 01:37:21.084
Bring it down.

01:37:21.709 --> 01:37:24.376
Bring it down.

01:37:25.001 --> 01:37:27.709
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

01:37:29.251 --> 01:37:30.917
Okay.

01:37:31.959 --> 01:37:34.542
Just don't do anything crazy, okay?

01:37:34.542 --> 01:37:36.251
You think I'm crazy?

01:37:36.251 --> 01:37:41.167
No. No, I said just don't... don't do anything crazy.

01:37:41.167 --> 01:37:42.876
Is this crazy to you?

01:37:42.876 --> 01:37:44.626
If you was me, you wouldn't do this?

01:37:44.626 --> 01:37:47.792
Give me one reason why... one.

01:37:48.792 --> 01:37:53.834
Maybe to try to not... not die in this... this fucking shithole.

01:37:54.709 --> 01:37:58.542
I don't like to die in this shithole!

01:37:58.542 --> 01:38:02.667
But one way or another, this is the place I will die.

01:38:02.667 --> 01:38:05.251
Look, you don't know that.

01:38:05.251 --> 01:38:08.459
You can't know that.

01:38:09.084 --> 01:38:12.501
Ali, things can change.

01:38:13.667 --> 01:38:15.417
Things... things can always change.

01:38:15.417 --> 01:38:19.542
You... you can't just, uh... you can't just fucking give up.

01:38:19.542 --> 01:38:22.584
- You got to... - Give up, blondie... what is "give up"?

01:38:22.584 --> 01:38:26.001
Three years ago, they took me to these interrogations.

01:38:26.001 --> 01:38:27.626
And one of your guys here,

01:38:27.626 --> 01:38:31.792
one of those guys who don't wear uniform... he told me that I'm innocent.

01:38:31.792 --> 01:38:35.667
He told me that he knows I'm innocent, but I still cannot go home...

01:38:35.667 --> 01:38:38.042
Because there's no country, no city,

01:38:38.042 --> 01:38:42.501
no fucking person in this planet will take me because I've been here.

01:38:43.334 --> 01:38:45.542
I have no place to go, blondie.

01:38:45.542 --> 01:38:49.584
This is the only thing that can change something.

01:38:56.876 --> 01:38:58.709
Everything okay?

01:39:00.876 --> 01:39:01.876
Yeah.

01:39:01.876 --> 01:39:04.334
Yeah, everything's fine. Um.

01:39:06.042 --> 01:39:08.709
My... my radio's... it's...it's on the Fritz.

01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:10.417
Can you get me another one?

01:39:10.417 --> 01:39:12.751
Uh, yeah.

01:39:27.709 --> 01:39:33.126
Blondie, you... you are a good guy.

01:39:34.292 --> 01:39:37.334
Yeah, thanks.

01:39:38.251 --> 01:39:40.917
Am I a bad guy or a good guy to you?

01:39:40.917 --> 01:39:45.084
Ali...It doesn't matter right now.

01:39:45.084 --> 01:39:48.751
It's the only time it matters.

01:39:50.167 --> 01:39:53.001
So you're gonna just...

01:39:54.084 --> 01:39:56.084
you're gonna be a martyr? Is that what you think you're...

01:39:56.084 --> 01:39:57.667
you think you're gonna go to heaven?

01:39:57.667 --> 01:40:00.209
That's what you want to do?

01:40:01.792 --> 01:40:05.501
I don't believe in this anymore.

01:40:05.501 --> 01:40:08.292
Well, then, why are you doing this?

01:40:08.292 --> 01:40:10.167
Look at me.

01:40:10.167 --> 01:40:14.626
You're asking me why do I want to die,

01:40:14.626 --> 01:40:18.417
but you don't see that I'm not even living.

01:40:18.417 --> 01:40:20.751
You guys control everything.

01:40:20.751 --> 01:40:25.626
You tell us what to eat, when to sleep.

01:40:25.626 --> 01:40:31.001
Even when we don't want to eat, you tell me we must.

01:40:31.417 --> 01:40:36.084
It is your life... it is not ours.

01:40:39.584 --> 01:40:44.292
I don't expect you to understand that.

01:40:45.626 --> 01:40:49.001
I-I like you.

01:40:50.417 --> 01:40:51.709
I do.

01:40:51.709 --> 01:40:56.959
But... but you'll never understand this.

01:41:03.959 --> 01:41:06.292
It's Amy.

01:41:08.834 --> 01:41:12.209
You keep calling me "blondie," but...

01:41:12.209 --> 01:41:17.001
My name's Amy Cole from Moore haven, Florida.

01:41:19.834 --> 01:41:22.209
And I like you, Ali.

01:41:22.209 --> 01:41:24.792
I really do.

01:41:40.792 --> 01:41:43.542
Ah, fuck! Hey, hey!

01:41:47.667 --> 01:41:51.376
Is there a... is there a zoo in Bremen?

01:41:54.542 --> 01:41:56.584
What?

01:41:58.834 --> 01:42:02.876
When I was a kid, I went to the zoo with my dad.

01:42:04.542 --> 01:42:08.251
It was just outside where we lived and, uh...

01:42:08.251 --> 01:42:09.542
It's really small,

01:42:09.542 --> 01:42:14.501
one of those zoos where they keep the animals locked up in these...

01:42:14.501 --> 01:42:17.334
these tiny, little cages, these tiny, little,

01:42:17.334 --> 01:42:22.709
like, concrete boxes with tires in them or something.

01:42:26.667 --> 01:42:28.584
I was really excited about going.

01:42:28.584 --> 01:42:32.292
I really wanted to see something outside my town.

01:42:32.292 --> 01:42:34.667
I wanted to be...

01:42:34.667 --> 01:42:39.167
I wanted to be so close to something so wild and...

01:42:43.209 --> 01:42:45.209
It just wasn't okay.

01:42:45.209 --> 01:42:48.417
I didn't. I didn't like it.

01:42:48.417 --> 01:42:52.792
And my clad kept trying to fucking tell me that it was okay, that...

01:42:52.792 --> 01:42:57.792
that this lion could never go back home because...

01:42:57.792 --> 01:43:00.292
because he wouldn't be able to survive in the wild,

01:43:00.292 --> 01:43:01.876
having been locked up for so long.

01:43:01.876 --> 01:43:07.209
Okay. You're trying to tell me that the zoo people... they are not guilty.

01:43:07.209 --> 01:43:10.209
They have no choice.

01:43:12.626 --> 01:43:14.501
No.

01:43:18.876 --> 01:43:22.667
I thought they had a choice.

01:43:23.709 --> 01:43:27.959
If they had the choice, they should've given it to him.

01:43:29.209 --> 01:43:33.167
They should have let the lion choose.

01:47:58.167 --> 01:48:00.959
You're the new guy, huh?

01:48:02.251 --> 01:48:05.167
Tell me... how do you like it here?

01:48:05.167 --> 01:48:08.542
Do you want a book or not?

01:48:08.542 --> 01:48:11.667
Hold on your horses, big ear.

01:48:11.667 --> 01:48:14.959
No one here goes anywhere.

01:48:14.959 --> 01:48:17.209
At least, I'm...

01:48:17.209 --> 01:48:21.834
what... what is that book there, the big one?

01:48:22.584 --> 01:48:25.126
No. No, the b... the big one.

01:48:25.126 --> 01:48:28.042
The... the big yellow book!

01:48:28.042 --> 01:48:31.167
The big... the yellow big book!

01:48:31.167 --> 01:48:34.667
Yes, that... give it to me.

01:48:34.667 --> 01:48:37.417
Yeah, give that book.

01:49:05.209 --> 01:49:12.542
<i>[ Introduction to the antlers' "kettering" plays]</i>
