WEBVTT

00:03.317 --> 00:05.326
Jack.
Got a minute?

00:05.394 --> 00:06.665
Avery, of course.

00:06.733 --> 00:07.766
Are you okay?

00:07.834 --> 00:09.000
Oh, yeah, it's nothing.

00:09.067 --> 00:11.064
<i>I was a guest on mad money
last night.</i>

00:11.132 --> 00:13.065
What's happening?
Is one of you Jim Cramer?

00:13.132 --> 00:14.364
Okay, stop it, stop it!

00:14.432 --> 00:16.731
I didn't realize
we were still airing that.

00:16.799 --> 00:18.804
Cramer's been dead
for six months.

00:18.872 --> 00:20.905
Look, I know
I'm supposed to go with you

00:20.973 --> 00:22.306
To Cerie's wedding
this weekend,

00:22.373 --> 00:23.606
But I can't make it.

00:23.676 --> 00:25.445
Okay, I know you and I
are in a period

00:25.512 --> 00:27.412
Of detente right now
because of my other--

00:27.480 --> 00:28.581
- Piece of tail?

00:28.650 --> 00:30.583
I was going to say
romantic entanglements,

00:30.650 --> 00:32.484
But you do not want
to miss this wedding.

00:32.552 --> 00:34.119
It's going to be
New York royalty.

00:34.187 --> 00:35.421
The Astors, the Rockefellers.

00:35.489 --> 00:36.423
The Sbarros.

00:36.491 --> 00:37.592
Yes, I know, Jack.

00:37.660 --> 00:38.759
You think I don't want to know

00:38.827 --> 00:40.327
What pizzarina Sbarro
is gonna be wearing?

00:40.395 --> 00:41.362
Then come.

00:41.429 --> 00:42.698
We both know
that is a bad idea.

00:42.766 --> 00:44.300
Which is why I scheduled
a conflict for this weekend

00:44.368 --> 00:45.334
I can't get out of.

00:45.402 --> 00:46.436
What is it?

00:46.503 --> 00:47.438
Well, if you must know,

00:47.505 --> 00:49.108
I'm on dodecacil.

00:49.176 --> 00:51.076
The pill where you only
get your period once a year.

00:51.144 --> 00:54.079
Ugh! We're so close to beating
that thing completely.

00:54.147 --> 00:55.615
Ah, well, my time has come.

00:55.683 --> 00:57.451
I'm going to a spa.

00:57.518 --> 00:58.519
Well, it's not really a spa.

00:58.586 --> 00:59.821
It's more
of a fenced-in area

00:59.889 --> 01:00.855
In the Adirondacks.

01:00.923 --> 01:02.958
Fine.
I'll go alone.

01:03.026 --> 01:05.328
And while I'm gone,

01:05.394 --> 01:08.530
Do some thinking about us.

01:08.598 --> 01:10.099
I promise you,
this weekend will be filled

01:10.166 --> 01:13.335
With staring out windows while
holding a glass of scotch.

01:13.402 --> 01:16.839
That means a lot to me.

01:16.907 --> 01:20.776
- Have a, uh, good time
at your fenced-in area.

01:20.844 --> 01:22.444
And I'll see you in two weeks.

01:22.512 --> 01:24.313
What's that supposed to mean,
you dumb douche?

01:24.380 --> 01:25.747
Ooh, it's starting.

01:25.814 --> 01:28.282
I should go.

01:31.285 --> 01:33.719
- Aloha means hello
and good-bye.

01:33.787 --> 01:34.720
So aloha.

01:34.788 --> 01:36.455
- What?
- What?

01:36.523 --> 01:38.391
Hi, handsome.

01:38.459 --> 01:40.326
I didn't know
you were coming to New York.

01:40.394 --> 01:42.362
I'm here to see my man.

01:42.430 --> 01:44.398
You're not busy this weekend,
are ya?

01:44.466 --> 01:45.432
Well, I am, actually.

01:45.500 --> 01:46.500
I have some thinking to do.

01:46.568 --> 01:47.802
Well, you can do your thinkin'.

01:47.870 --> 01:49.470
We'll just do it together
on that tour boat

01:49.538 --> 01:51.907
That's painted like a shark.

01:51.974 --> 01:54.176
Hey, Liz, I need to know
the name of the date

01:54.243 --> 01:55.410
You're bringing to my wedding.

01:55.478 --> 01:56.711
I'm coming alone, Cerie.

01:56.779 --> 01:58.646
But I would still
like two meals.

01:58.713 --> 01:59.813
So is it okay if I sit you

01:59.881 --> 02:01.415
Next to
my dad's mistress' cousin?

02:01.483 --> 02:02.682
Whatever makes it
easier for you.

02:02.750 --> 02:04.250
Awesome.

02:04.318 --> 02:06.119
God, three weddings in one day.

02:06.186 --> 02:08.154
I am gonna be in spanx
for 12 hours.

02:08.222 --> 02:10.222
My elastic line is gonna
get infected again.

02:10.289 --> 02:12.691
Are you really not bringing
someone to Cerie's wedding?

02:12.759 --> 02:14.360
I don't care
about having a date.

02:14.427 --> 02:15.894
What about Floyd's wedding?

02:15.962 --> 02:17.529
If I have to sit
through that alone,

02:17.597 --> 02:19.198
I will rent a car,
set it on fire,

02:19.265 --> 02:20.700
And drive it off a waterfall.

02:20.767 --> 02:22.168
I could set you up
with my trainer.

02:22.236 --> 02:24.070
He's gay, but not
when he's drunk.

02:24.138 --> 02:25.605
No, I don't need help, Jenna.

02:25.672 --> 02:27.239
I know where I'm gonna
find my date,

02:27.307 --> 02:29.241
Because I have already met him.

02:29.309 --> 02:30.442
What are you talking about?

02:30.510 --> 02:31.876
Jack's mom said to me

02:31.944 --> 02:33.411
That there's only a few
different types of men

02:33.479 --> 02:34.579
In the world.

02:34.647 --> 02:36.915
And, at my age,
I have met all of them.

02:36.983 --> 02:39.184
So I'm gonna go back through
my gentleman Rolodex--

02:39.252 --> 02:40.919
- Sexual time travel.

02:40.987 --> 02:42.320
Just like my cinemax soft core,

02:42.388 --> 02:44.189
<i>Emmanuelle goes
to dinosaur land.</i>

02:44.257 --> 02:45.892
I've dated plenty of good guys.

02:45.960 --> 02:47.927
My standards have just
been too high.

02:47.995 --> 02:49.162
Yeah, they have.

02:49.229 --> 02:51.564
Meet me in the handicapped stall
in ten seconds.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:17.930 --> 03:19.630
Liz Lemon.

03:19.698 --> 03:20.964
I was just thinking
about you the other day.

03:21.032 --> 03:22.066
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:22.133 --> 03:24.101
I saw this gorgeous woman
putting glasses

03:24.168 --> 03:25.268
On her daughter's
Mrs. Potato head.

03:25.336 --> 03:27.337
The "why" is not important.

03:27.405 --> 03:28.438
Can we talk?

03:28.506 --> 03:30.707
Sure.

03:30.775 --> 03:32.876
I was just doing some baking.

03:32.944 --> 03:34.277
Uh, can I get you
something to drink?

03:34.345 --> 03:36.679
What goes good
with second chances?

03:36.747 --> 03:38.315
Ugh, water.
I'd like water.

03:38.382 --> 03:39.449
So...

03:39.517 --> 03:40.717
Are you seeing anyone?

03:40.785 --> 03:41.785
Oh...

03:41.853 --> 03:43.387
<i>This conversation.</i>

03:43.454 --> 03:44.988
Uh, no, I'm still single.

03:45.056 --> 03:47.691
No one serious
since you, actually.

03:47.759 --> 03:49.226
Well, that's good to hear.

03:49.294 --> 03:50.494
You know, when we broke up,

03:50.562 --> 03:52.796
It was because I felt like
I was smarter than you.

03:52.864 --> 03:55.665
But that's so judgmental
and--and now I just--

03:55.733 --> 03:57.601
oh, my God.

03:57.668 --> 03:59.202
What?

03:59.270 --> 04:01.805
Oh, my hooks, heh.

04:01.872 --> 04:04.641
I'm just so comfortable
with them that--that--

04:04.708 --> 04:05.808
Ohh.

04:05.876 --> 04:07.577
Whoops.

04:07.645 --> 04:09.813
Oh! Oh!

04:09.881 --> 04:10.881
Oh, not again.

04:13.218 --> 04:15.120
That was my last
ungashed painting.

04:15.187 --> 04:16.488
How did this happen?

04:16.555 --> 04:19.190
Uh, freak accident.

04:19.257 --> 04:22.794
You know I work
with doctors without borders.

04:22.862 --> 04:25.197
Well, I was helicoptering
into Zimbabwe

04:25.264 --> 04:28.099
When I thought I saw
somebody that I knew.

04:28.167 --> 04:30.902
So I waved from the helicopter,

04:30.970 --> 04:32.170
Which, it turns out,
is a big no-no,

04:32.238 --> 04:35.106
And the rotor took my right hand
clean off.

04:35.174 --> 04:36.942
And it turns out the person
I was waving to

04:37.009 --> 04:38.477
<i>Was not my old football coach.</i>

04:38.544 --> 04:40.879
Of course not.
You were in Zimbabwe.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.615
Well, it looked just like
a black version of him.

04:43.683 --> 04:45.150
What about the other hand?

04:45.218 --> 04:47.219
Oh, well, to celebrate
my return from Africa,

04:47.286 --> 04:49.321
My cousin and I bought
a bunch of fireworks.

04:49.388 --> 04:50.955
You know what?
This was a bad idea.

04:51.023 --> 04:51.956
I should just go.

04:52.024 --> 04:53.425
What, you're too good for me

04:53.492 --> 04:55.026
Now that I have
pirate hook hands?

04:55.094 --> 04:57.229
It is absolutely
not because you are disabled.

04:57.296 --> 04:59.731
I've been dumped by four
different guys in wheelchairs.

04:59.799 --> 05:00.899
Look, I'll have you know, Liz,

05:00.967 --> 05:03.134
That I am in line
for a hand transplant.

05:03.202 --> 05:06.037
There's this strangler
who's about to be executed,

05:06.105 --> 05:08.473
And, uh, I got
my hooks crossed.

05:11.277 --> 05:12.210
Oh, heh.

05:12.278 --> 05:13.311
Oh, my God, drew,

05:13.379 --> 05:14.412
It's not about the hooks.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.680
It's how you got that way.

05:15.748 --> 05:18.583
You're just too dumb.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.685
Wait, Liz.

05:20.753 --> 05:22.420
Don't go.

05:22.488 --> 05:23.722
Ow, it's hot!

05:23.790 --> 05:24.756
Yeah, of course it's hot.

05:24.824 --> 05:25.890
It's been in the oven.

05:25.958 --> 05:27.425
Now who's the dumb one?

05:29.028 --> 05:30.862
Uh, so handsome.

05:33.132 --> 05:34.499
Entourage meeting.

05:34.567 --> 05:37.969
I know which movie
I'm doing this summer.

05:38.036 --> 05:40.905
<i>Feline groovy?</i>

05:40.973 --> 05:43.774
It's a pun, because
cats' paws have grooves.

05:43.842 --> 05:44.908
And this is really what

05:44.976 --> 05:46.210
You want to spend
your summer doing?

05:46.277 --> 05:47.278
It's perfect!

05:47.345 --> 05:48.446
I'm playing Garfield.

05:48.513 --> 05:49.913
My whole part's being shot

05:49.981 --> 05:51.682
On green screen in three days.

05:51.750 --> 05:54.652
And they're paying me exactly
one million teachers' salaries.

05:54.720 --> 05:56.554
Tray, I think it's time
you take a risk.

05:56.621 --> 05:58.022
Maybe do a dramatic role.

05:58.090 --> 05:59.857
Go for the "o"
in your "egot."

05:59.925 --> 06:00.858
What's this?

06:00.926 --> 06:02.092
<i>Hard to watch,</i>

06:02.160 --> 06:03.561
<i>Based on on the book
stone cold bummer</i>

06:03.629 --> 06:04.796
By manipulate.

06:04.863 --> 06:05.896
It's about growing up
in our old neighborhood.

06:05.964 --> 06:08.399
And it's real Oscar bait, sir.

06:08.467 --> 06:11.102
You say things like,
"you don't know my pain,"

06:11.169 --> 06:13.438
And, "you watch
your mouth, tyrese."

06:13.505 --> 06:15.507
And, in a less dramatic scene,

06:15.574 --> 06:17.308
"I'll have hash browns."

06:17.376 --> 06:19.444
Interesting.

06:21.113 --> 06:23.048
And I've got to win
an Oscar somehow.

06:23.115 --> 06:25.983
It's either this
or I submit that animated film

06:26.051 --> 06:27.451
I drew about the holocaust.

06:27.519 --> 06:31.121
- This.
- We should definitely do this.

06:31.189 --> 06:32.289
Nancy and Avery

06:32.356 --> 06:33.990
Almost ran into each other
at the elevator.

06:34.058 --> 06:35.559
Seriously?

06:35.626 --> 06:38.161
You rode the shark boat?
Was it scary?

06:38.229 --> 06:40.497
Oh. This whole thing...

06:40.565 --> 06:41.699
Is getting out of control.

06:41.766 --> 06:43.934
Yeah, you need
to be honest with everyone.

06:44.002 --> 06:46.503
It's only fair that
you tell Nancy about Avery.

06:46.571 --> 06:47.771
That is terrible advice!

06:47.838 --> 06:48.939
If I tell Nancy,

06:49.007 --> 06:50.674
It'll just complicate things.

06:50.742 --> 06:52.443
I need to keep her
at arm's length this weekend.

06:52.510 --> 06:54.812
I prepared
a very unromantic evening.

06:54.880 --> 06:55.846
First, we're going
to see a documentary

06:55.914 --> 06:57.214
About female circumcision,

06:57.282 --> 06:59.115
And then we're going to eat
too much Indian food.

06:59.183 --> 07:00.984
Okay, but you're just
avoiding the problem.

07:01.052 --> 07:03.753
Sometimes, the right thing
and the hard thing

07:03.821 --> 07:06.189
Are the same thing.

07:06.257 --> 07:07.591
I read that on a tea bag.

07:07.658 --> 07:09.225
If you want to be helpful,

07:09.293 --> 07:10.293
Just give me some more advice

07:10.361 --> 07:11.795
On how to keep a date asexual.

07:11.862 --> 07:13.229
You know what?
Sometimes I think--

07:13.297 --> 07:14.264
- That's great.

07:14.332 --> 07:15.432
"you know what?
Sometimes I think--"

07:15.500 --> 07:16.600
That's really annoying.

07:16.667 --> 07:18.101
I'm gonna use that.
You're the best.

07:18.169 --> 07:19.970
Honestly, though, sometimes I...

07:20.037 --> 07:22.706
Okay, I hear it.

07:22.773 --> 07:24.141
I read the script.

07:24.209 --> 07:25.442
And? Did you like it?

07:25.510 --> 07:26.977
I hated it!

07:27.044 --> 07:28.278
I couldn't relate.

07:28.345 --> 07:29.613
What?

07:29.680 --> 07:31.448
It's about growing up poor
in the South Bronx.

07:31.515 --> 07:33.450
Moving from foster home
to foster home.

07:33.517 --> 07:35.419
Seeing a pigeon fight a baby.

07:35.486 --> 07:37.120
All of that happened to you.

07:37.188 --> 07:38.755
I don't remember
that kind of stuff.

07:38.823 --> 07:41.090
I mean, I remember
being born, of course.

07:41.158 --> 07:43.059
I remember learning
how to ride a bike.

07:43.127 --> 07:44.460
But that was last year.

07:44.528 --> 07:47.695
From '75 to '82 is just a blur.

07:47.763 --> 07:49.297
Then you're
repressing some stuff.

07:49.365 --> 07:50.665
That can happen.

07:50.733 --> 07:53.701
I remember the summer
my webelos group went camping,

07:53.769 --> 07:55.870
And we were taken
by the hill people.

07:55.938 --> 07:58.406
Next thing I knew,
summer was over,

07:58.474 --> 08:01.009
And it was time
for back-to-school shopping.

08:01.076 --> 08:02.843
Tray, this
is an important film.

08:02.911 --> 08:04.145
Oh, brother.

08:04.212 --> 08:06.014
If you want to get your "o,"

08:06.081 --> 08:07.649
You've got to reconnect
with your roots.

08:07.716 --> 08:08.816
No, I don't.

08:08.884 --> 08:11.452
I was on a yacht
with the roots last week.

08:11.520 --> 08:14.688
Dude!

08:14.756 --> 08:16.057
Hello, Dennis.

08:16.124 --> 08:17.691
Hey, dummy.

08:17.759 --> 08:18.726
You know, as soon
as my beeper went off,

08:18.793 --> 08:19.793
I knew it was you.

08:19.861 --> 08:21.428
I got a personalized vibration

08:21.496 --> 08:22.729
For each chick
I used to put it to.

08:22.797 --> 08:24.231
Hmm.

08:24.298 --> 08:25.398
Thanks for meeting me
at my workplace.

08:25.466 --> 08:27.000
Yeah, what exactly
are you building here?

08:27.067 --> 08:29.068
Hey, Liz, you want
to be a millionaire?

08:29.135 --> 08:30.436
Hmm?
Mr. Dennis.

08:30.503 --> 08:32.169
No, no, no, Jose.
Only babies out here.

08:32.238 --> 08:33.337
Don't you want to be a big boy?

08:33.405 --> 08:35.006
- Ow.
- Who's that kid?

08:35.073 --> 08:36.039
That's Jose.

08:36.107 --> 08:37.441
I met him through this program

08:37.509 --> 08:39.176
That places troubled adults
with child mentors.

08:39.244 --> 08:41.410
Wait, are you planning
to balloon boy him?

08:41.479 --> 08:42.746
Liz, listen to me.

08:42.813 --> 08:45.182
What was the one mistake
those people in Denver made?

08:45.250 --> 08:46.316
<i>One mistake?</i>

08:46.384 --> 08:47.851
Yeah, there was no kid
in the balloon.

08:47.919 --> 08:50.587
When Jose jumps out of there,
or whatever,

08:50.655 --> 08:51.822
People are gonna go nuts!

08:51.890 --> 08:54.458
Oh, my God.

08:54.526 --> 08:56.661
Go, run.

08:56.728 --> 08:58.028
Unbelievable.

08:58.096 --> 08:59.430
These are the men in my life.

08:59.498 --> 09:00.999
What did I do wrong?

09:01.066 --> 09:02.433
Well, the first thing
you did wrong

09:02.501 --> 09:03.668
Was you touched the balloon.

09:03.736 --> 09:05.670
This is a scientific
facility, Liz.

09:05.738 --> 09:08.774
This is a public park
named after Ron Artest.

09:08.842 --> 09:12.344
Yeah, and like Jose,
Ron dreamed of glory.

09:12.412 --> 09:13.446
Hey, Liz...

09:13.513 --> 09:14.914
You'll be back!

09:14.982 --> 09:16.582
Hey, what's goin' on, huh?

09:16.650 --> 09:18.685
What's your deal?

09:18.752 --> 09:20.053
Lesbian.

09:21.856 --> 09:23.256
How was your dinner?

09:23.324 --> 09:25.192
Mm, I'm stuffed.

09:25.259 --> 09:26.459
That place is good.

09:26.527 --> 09:29.495

09:32.600 --> 09:33.833
Yeah.

09:33.901 --> 09:36.702
Uh...You know what I like
after too much curry?

09:36.770 --> 09:38.437

Liz, I'm gonna guess

11:11.726 --> 11:13.093
That the last two months,

11:13.161 --> 11:15.229
There's been a lot
of singles events in gymnasia,

11:15.296 --> 11:17.665
And, uh, oh, don't tell me.

11:17.732 --> 11:21.201
You revisited old boyfriends,
didn't you?

11:21.269 --> 11:22.837
That's never worked.

11:22.904 --> 11:25.306
<i>Oh, my God.
I hate you.</i>

11:25.374 --> 11:27.342
Yeah, but that's it, isn't it?

11:27.409 --> 11:29.877
The only thing wrong with me...

11:29.945 --> 11:30.912
Is that you hate me.

11:30.979 --> 11:32.914
So with that as my only defect,

11:32.982 --> 11:34.282
Where do I rank

11:34.349 --> 11:36.150
With all the other men
that you've been with?

11:39.088 --> 11:41.055
Okay, I have another
wedding tomorrow.

11:41.123 --> 11:43.390
It's my ex-boyfriend Floyd.

11:44.659 --> 11:46.593
Will you come with me?

11:46.661 --> 11:47.894
And then there was Wesley.

11:47.962 --> 11:49.829
God, I hate you.

11:54.501 --> 11:55.601
Well...

11:55.668 --> 11:59.938
Good mornin'.

12:00.005 --> 12:01.906
I'm glad we did this, Jack.

12:01.973 --> 12:04.474
It was a huge step.

12:04.542 --> 12:05.609
But it feels right.

12:05.677 --> 12:08.544
Huge seems like the wrong word.

12:08.612 --> 12:10.446
I mean, sex is not
that big a deal, right?

12:10.514 --> 12:12.281
How could something
that animals do

12:12.348 --> 12:13.615
Be a big deal?

12:13.683 --> 12:17.284
Worms can do it with...
Any other worm.

12:17.352 --> 12:19.152
Well, it was a big deal for me.

12:19.220 --> 12:20.386
Besides my ex-husband,

12:20.454 --> 12:21.887
You're the only other man
I've slept with.

12:21.955 --> 12:23.889
Two men?

12:23.957 --> 12:25.491
That can't be true.

12:25.558 --> 12:26.859
Well...

12:26.926 --> 12:30.462
Uh, look, Jack...

12:30.530 --> 12:32.631
There's something
I have to tell ya.

12:32.699 --> 12:35.167
I did somethin' bad.

12:35.235 --> 12:37.002
After my divorce,

12:37.070 --> 12:39.105
I went out with my girlfriends,

12:39.172 --> 12:41.073
And I danced with a guy.

12:41.141 --> 12:42.641
That's it?

12:42.709 --> 12:44.109
Also...

12:44.177 --> 12:45.777
It was after midnight
on a Saturday,

12:45.845 --> 12:47.145
So technically,
it was a Sunday.

12:47.212 --> 12:48.512
A man had his hands on my hips

12:48.580 --> 12:50.347
On a day that was
set aside for the lord!

12:50.414 --> 12:52.248
There! I said it.

12:53.651 --> 12:55.651
Man, catholic guilt.

12:55.719 --> 12:57.086
Am I right?

12:57.154 --> 12:59.088
Those nuns really messed me up.

13:01.457 --> 13:03.057
Not me!

13:12.399 --> 13:14.100
What are we doing here?

13:14.168 --> 13:16.402
You told me we were going
someplace boring.

13:16.470 --> 13:18.438
This is an awesome copy shop!

13:18.505 --> 13:20.172
Well, this copy shop
is on the corner

13:20.240 --> 13:22.675
Of 157th street and
Lieutenant Uhura Avenue.

13:22.742 --> 13:24.043
That's where I grew up.

13:24.110 --> 13:26.011
Obviously,
your building is gone.

13:26.079 --> 13:27.980
I guess someone
didn't come up here

13:28.047 --> 13:29.281
To scout the location first.

13:29.349 --> 13:31.283
'cause someone else
didn't sign off

13:31.351 --> 13:32.384
On the transportation budget.

13:32.452 --> 13:34.954
I never check
that earthlink account.

13:35.022 --> 13:37.590
God, nothing's changed at all.

13:37.658 --> 13:39.091
It's changed completely, tray.

13:39.159 --> 13:40.292
What is wrong with you?

13:40.360 --> 13:41.793
We brought you up here
to jog your memory,

13:41.861 --> 13:43.428
But I guess that
was a waste of time.

13:43.496 --> 13:45.129
Because someone came up

13:45.197 --> 13:48.131
With this stupid idea
in the first place.

13:48.199 --> 13:49.699
Let's just go.

13:49.767 --> 13:51.800
Why do I recognize
that stairwell?

13:56.772 --> 13:58.705
It's all coming back to me.

13:58.773 --> 14:02.942
Oh, my God, I slept on an old
dog bed stuffed with wigs!

14:03.010 --> 14:06.613
I watched a prostitute
stab a clown!

14:06.681 --> 14:09.215
Our basketball hoop
was a rib cage.

14:09.283 --> 14:11.618
A rib cage!

14:11.685 --> 14:13.453
Why did you bring me here?

14:13.521 --> 14:15.823
I blocked all this stuff out
for a reason!

14:15.890 --> 14:18.125
Oh, lord!

14:18.192 --> 14:21.691

electrocuted my fish!

Tray, use this pain
to get your Oscar.

14:57.424 --> 14:58.925
She put on red underwear.

14:58.993 --> 15:00.827
You would think
it would clash with her hair.

15:00.894 --> 15:01.928

And...Act!

16:57.131 --> 16:59.633
Nermal!
I hate you, Nermal!

16:59.701 --> 17:02.269
Almost as much
as I hate Mondays!

17:02.337 --> 17:03.972
This is my lasagna!

17:04.039 --> 17:05.406
You hear me, Nermal?

17:05.473 --> 17:07.040
My lasagna!

17:07.108 --> 17:08.209
Okay, let's cut.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.111
Okay...

17:10.178 --> 17:11.279
Maybe a little less intense,
you know?

17:11.347 --> 17:12.513
You're Garfield.

17:12.580 --> 17:13.580
You're a cat

17:13.648 --> 17:15.616
Who likes sleeping and lasagna.

17:15.684 --> 17:18.118
Well, I'm sorry, Shawn...

17:18.185 --> 17:20.755
And child actor whose name
I can't remember.

17:20.823 --> 17:23.223
You haven't walked in my shoes.

17:23.291 --> 17:27.095
All my life, I tried
to forget the things I've seen.

17:27.163 --> 17:29.964
A crackhead
breastfeeding a rat.

17:30.032 --> 17:32.400
A homeless man cooking
a hot pocket

17:32.468 --> 17:34.835
On the third rail
of the g-train.

17:34.903 --> 17:37.471
The g-train, Nermal!

17:37.539 --> 17:40.741
<i>There's something inside of me
that needs to come out.</i>

17:40.809 --> 17:43.411
<i>And if Garfield 3:
Feline groovy</i>

17:43.478 --> 17:44.945
Can't tell my story,

17:45.013 --> 17:47.682
Then I'll win my Oscar
elsewhere.

17:47.749 --> 17:49.984
Or I'll die tryin'.

17:53.556 --> 17:55.657
Okay, so are you
not doing this movie?

17:55.725 --> 17:57.927
'cause that suit
was made special!

17:57.994 --> 17:59.528
For your weird body!

17:59.596 --> 18:02.198
Are you doing a reading too?

18:02.265 --> 18:03.999
I'm Mike.
I'm friends with Floyd.

18:04.067 --> 18:05.234
Hi.

18:12.243 --> 18:13.810
Excuse me, do you have a job,

18:13.877 --> 18:15.178
And are you here with someone?

18:15.245 --> 18:17.179
Uh, I'm a lawyer,

18:17.247 --> 18:18.650
And I'm single.

18:18.718 --> 18:19.919
Okay, friend, here's the deal.

18:19.987 --> 18:22.789
My name is Liz, I almost
got 1,200 on my s.A.T.S,

18:22.857 --> 18:23.990
And I need a date
for this wedding

18:24.058 --> 18:25.792
And I like your head shape.

18:25.860 --> 18:27.493
What do you say?

18:27.561 --> 18:29.295
I'd love to be your date, Liz.

18:29.363 --> 18:31.197
Okay.

18:31.264 --> 18:33.565
I like how forward you are.

18:33.632 --> 18:34.999
Now may I tell you something?

18:35.067 --> 18:36.067
I'm a plushie.

18:36.135 --> 18:38.336
Is that a fraternity?

18:38.404 --> 18:39.637
Kind of.

18:39.705 --> 18:42.039
It means I belong to a group
of like-minded people

18:42.107 --> 18:43.507
Who dress up
in mascot costumes.

18:43.575 --> 18:44.742
- Oh-Kay...

18:44.809 --> 18:47.044
And have orgies
in hotel rooms and state parks.

18:47.112 --> 18:48.178
There it is.

18:48.246 --> 18:51.181
Our term for intercourse
is "yiffing."

18:51.249 --> 18:53.250
Would you excuse me, please?

18:55.220 --> 18:58.055
Okay, fine.
Let's get married.

18:58.123 --> 18:59.323
Oh, yeah.

19:01.794 --> 19:04.663
<i>And now a reading
from Corinthians.</i>

19:04.730 --> 19:06.365
"love is patient.

19:06.432 --> 19:08.034
"love is kind.

19:08.101 --> 19:09.635
"it is not jealous.

19:09.703 --> 19:11.270
"it is not pompous.

19:11.338 --> 19:13.640
"it does not envy.
It does not boast.

19:13.708 --> 19:16.176
It is not proud.
It is not rude..."

19:16.244 --> 19:17.478
Nothin' like being in church,

19:17.545 --> 19:19.714
Having spend the night doing
a bunch of bad crap.

19:19.782 --> 19:20.749
Am I right?

19:20.816 --> 19:22.551
Yes, uh...

19:22.618 --> 19:23.552
Speaking of which,

19:23.619 --> 19:25.353
I'm seeing someone else,

19:25.421 --> 19:27.589
And I think I'm in love
with both of you.

19:27.657 --> 19:31.025
You lying bastard.

19:31.093 --> 19:32.260
After last night?

19:32.328 --> 19:33.428
Nancy, just let me explain.

19:33.496 --> 19:34.797
No, I'm out of here.

19:34.864 --> 19:35.797
You can't leave, Donovan.

19:35.865 --> 19:37.699
We're in the middle of mass.

19:40.036 --> 19:41.969
You and I both know
you have to stay

19:42.037 --> 19:43.738
Until the final blessing,
so let's talk.

19:43.805 --> 19:45.773
No, I'm not saying
a word to you.

19:45.841 --> 19:46.941
The second this mass is over,

19:47.009 --> 19:48.276
I'm on the first train
back to Boston.

19:48.343 --> 19:49.710
And you'll never see me again.

19:49.778 --> 19:52.579
"faith, hope, and love.

19:52.647 --> 19:53.914
"and as for knowledge,

19:53.981 --> 19:55.248
It will pass away."

19:59.252 --> 20:01.119
Stall?

20:04.590 --> 20:07.559
And now, an unscheduled reading

20:07.627 --> 20:10.896
That I think is appropriate
for this lovely

20:10.964 --> 20:12.565
Romantic occasion.

20:12.632 --> 20:15.167
"but Onan knew
that the offspring

20:15.234 --> 20:16.668
"would not be his,

20:16.736 --> 20:19.504
"so whenever he lay
with his brother's wife,

20:19.572 --> 20:22.607
He spilled his semen
on the ground."

20:22.674 --> 20:23.775
Sorry.

20:25.810 --> 20:27.945
"then Zipporah took a flint

20:28.013 --> 20:30.114
And cut off her son's
foreskin."

20:30.182 --> 20:34.085
Oh, come on, bible.
Help a lady out.

20:34.152 --> 20:35.386
"for he has sold us,

20:35.454 --> 20:38.122
And he has indeed
devoured our money."

20:43.848 --> 20:46.617
I seen a blind guy
bite a police horse!

20:46.684 --> 20:48.986
A puppy committed suicide
after he saw our bathroom!

20:49.053 --> 20:50.954
I once bit into a burrito,

20:51.022 --> 20:52.389
And there was a child's shoe
in it!

20:52.457 --> 20:54.557
I seen a hooker eat a tire.

20:54.625 --> 20:56.727
A pack of wild dogs took over

20:56.795 --> 20:58.829
And successfully ran a Wendy's!

20:58.896 --> 21:02.599
The sewer people
stole my skateboard!

21:02.667 --> 21:04.901
The projects I lived in was
named after Zachary Taylor,

21:04.969 --> 21:06.570
Generally considered to be

21:06.637 --> 21:08.738
One of the worst presidents
of all time!

21:08.806 --> 21:12.108
I once saw a baby
give another baby a tattoo!

21:12.176 --> 21:13.943
They were very drunk!
