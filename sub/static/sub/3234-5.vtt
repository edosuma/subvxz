00:34.255 --> 00:37.257
I am awake.

00:38.593 --> 00:41.361
You are not how I
remember you from class.

00:41.396 --> 00:42.929
I mean, like, not at all.

00:51.272 --> 00:53.006
Dude, this isn't even 7 grand.

00:53.041 --> 00:54.975
My guy wants 85.

00:56.577 --> 00:59.679
This is all the money
I have in the world.

00:59.714 --> 01:02.049
You are a drug dealer.
Negotiate.

01:04.285 --> 01:06.420
Buy the RV.

01:07.922 --> 01:09.556
We start tomorrow.

01:18.633 --> 01:21.001
Work it, work it, baby.

01:21.035 --> 01:22.869
Yo, this is sick, brother.

01:22.904 --> 01:24.104
Totally.

01:24.138 --> 01:25.872
God.
 Yo, Jesse.

01:25.907 --> 01:29.843
I got these two fine ladies
want to participate.

01:29.877 --> 01:31.178
You got the funds?

01:31.212 --> 01:32.512
Oh, I got the funds.

01:32.547 --> 01:35.782
Hey, would you ladies
like to meet my fat stack?

01:38.252 --> 01:42.923
Get in here. Come on.

01:42.957 --> 01:44.157
Hey, yo, yo.

01:44.192 --> 01:46.059
Yo, you got champagne?

01:46.094 --> 01:47.360
None of that cheap stuff.

01:47.395 --> 01:48.795
I want the expensive shit.

01:48.830 --> 01:50.397
Don Perig-non.

01:50.431 --> 01:51.932
It's 400 a bottle.

01:51.966 --> 01:54.101
Oh, well, in that case,

01:54.135 --> 01:55.602
I'll only have two.

01:55.636 --> 01:58.438
Oh, and I want
the tall, skinny glasses.

01:58.473 --> 02:02.242
I like those skinny glasses.
That's what James Bond drinks.

02:02.276 --> 02:05.312
Mofos, I'm all about that.

02:05.346 --> 02:08.982
Yo, Jesse, man, I gotta ask.

02:09.015 --> 02:10.750
Where'd you
get all the cheddar?

02:10.785 --> 02:13.053
Must be moving mad volume.

02:13.087 --> 02:14.221
It's totally funny.

02:14.255 --> 02:15.355
You want to know what's funny?

02:15.389 --> 02:16.356
What's funny?

02:16.390 --> 02:18.592
This old dude,
he gave it to me.

02:18.626 --> 02:19.893
What?
He gave it tme.

02:19.927 --> 02:21.661
It's, like,
his entire life savings.

02:21.696 --> 02:23.196
What? Why?

02:23.231 --> 02:25.499
Because he's a dumb-ass.
That's why.

02:25.533 --> 02:26.900
Oh, God.

02:29.403 --> 02:32.906
Yes! Whoo! All right,
living large, players.

03:36.771 --> 03:37.971
Thank you.

03:38.005 --> 03:39.773
No, thank you.

03:43.411 --> 03:45.178
That was--

03:51.085 --> 03:52.485
...awesome, bro.

03:53.988 --> 03:56.623
Later.

03:56.657 --> 03:58.225
Oh, man.

03:58.259 --> 04:00.961
Oh, I'm so dead.

04:00.995 --> 04:04.598
I only got-- oh, damn.

04:07.068 --> 04:10.570
I only got, like, 1,400.

04:10.605 --> 04:14.040
Waffle House, yeah.

04:14.075 --> 04:16.576
No, man.

04:16.611 --> 04:19.478
I'm supposed to use that
dude's money to buy an RV.

04:19.512 --> 04:22.749
What you want with an RV for?

04:22.783 --> 04:24.751
'Cause it's like--

04:24.785 --> 04:29.656
It's like-- never mind.

04:29.690 --> 04:31.258
Jesus.

04:31.292 --> 04:33.827
Now I've got to,
like, leave town

04:33.861 --> 04:36.196
or change my identity
or something.

04:36.230 --> 04:39.799
Guy's blackmailing me.

04:39.834 --> 04:44.437
He's got, like,
a criminal mind, yo.

04:44.472 --> 04:47.274
RV, huh?

04:47.308 --> 04:49.075
I can hook you up, bro.

04:49.110 --> 04:51.011
I can totally get you an RV.

04:51.045 --> 04:53.647
No, I need it today-- now.

04:53.681 --> 04:57.017
No problem. Let's go.

04:57.051 --> 05:00.020
You're telling me
you can get me an RV?

05:00.054 --> 05:02.255
For 1,400 at 6 in the morning?

05:45.399 --> 05:46.833
Right on.

05:46.867 --> 05:49.102
So do I need to sign
something or something?

05:49.136 --> 05:52.839
Nah, it's, like,
a no-paperwork-type deal.

05:56.877 --> 05:58.645
Pleasure doing business
with you.

05:58.679 --> 06:01.081
Mm.

06:01.115 --> 06:03.049
Come on, we gotta bounce.

06:03.084 --> 06:05.118
What? For real, yo.
Get it out of here.

06:33.119 --> 06:43.119

06:54.768 --> 06:57.937
Oh, my God,

06:57.972 --> 07:00.006
I love this floor.

07:00.040 --> 07:04.477
This feels fantastic.

07:04.511 --> 07:07.313
Can you control
the temperature?

07:07.348 --> 07:11.384
Uh, yeah, there should be a
switch right next to you there.

07:11.418 --> 07:13.353
It's a thermostat.

07:18.058 --> 07:20.426
Ted...

07:20.461 --> 07:26.065
This has got to be the most
amazing invention ever.

07:27.234 --> 07:30.470
I know. Contractor talked me
into it.

07:30.504 --> 07:35.842
Seemed kind of extravagant,
but I gotta tell you,

07:35.876 --> 07:39.846
once you try it,
you can't go back.

07:39.880 --> 07:43.483
I can never find anything
in this Buick.

07:45.252 --> 07:49.589
You know, you could leave
a few things here if you want.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.682
Why don't you go get your dad?

08:15.716 --> 08:17.817
Sure.

08:25.192 --> 08:27.593
Hey, Dad.

08:27.628 --> 08:29.595
Dad.

08:29.630 --> 08:31.698
Uh, yeah.

08:31.732 --> 08:34.000
Um, Mom's asking,

08:34.034 --> 08:36.568
want to come to dinner?

08:36.602 --> 08:38.538
Uh, yeah, I'll be right there.

08:45.279 --> 08:47.647
You're not listening to me.
I don't know.

08:47.681 --> 08:49.315
<i>Yeah, right,
like you don't know.</i>

08:49.349 --> 08:51.451
Wha-- What did I just say?

08:51.485 --> 08:52.752
Give me the phone.
Give it.

08:52.786 --> 08:56.055
Like you didn't make
some deal behind my back.

08:56.090 --> 08:57.724
<i>Correct. I did not.</i>

08:57.758 --> 09:00.026
I was sitting at a stoplight,

09:00.060 --> 09:02.395
minding my own business,
when the man th--

09:02.429 --> 09:03.496
uh, the man--

09:03.530 --> 09:06.599
the kid threw a bag of money
through my window.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.534
Whatever, man.
You owe me that money.

09:08.569 --> 09:10.403
<i>Let me talk to him.
I owe you--</i>

09:10.437 --> 09:12.505
I owe you nothing,

09:12.539 --> 09:14.107
and I will get
to the bottom of this.

09:14.141 --> 09:15.775
<i>Trust me.
Trust you?</i>

09:15.809 --> 09:17.143
Trust you? That's a good one.

09:17.177 --> 09:18.778
Yeah, yeah,
that's what I'm going to do.

09:18.812 --> 09:20.279
You want to talk about trust,
Jesse?

09:20.314 --> 09:21.914
Let's talk about trust.

09:21.949 --> 09:24.117
I told you
not to cook my formula,

09:24.151 --> 09:25.618
and you went ahead
and did it anyway.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.987
'Cause I never said
I wouldn't cook it

09:28.021 --> 09:31.624
'cause it ain't yours.
It's ours. Plural, bitch.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.593
<i>You did not have
my permission.</i>

09:33.627 --> 09:36.696
Alls I know is I got
half the money I'm due,

09:36.730 --> 09:38.097
and you got the rest.

09:38.132 --> 09:40.333
Escalating--
You're escalating.

09:40.367 --> 09:41.534
You know what?
Escalate this.

09:41.568 --> 09:43.770
My meth, my money!

09:43.804 --> 09:45.671
<i>I will be a one-man
glass factory.</i>

09:45.706 --> 09:48.207
<i>I will rock that RV
24--</i>

10:52.072 --> 10:53.973
It's buttoned up tight.

10:54.007 --> 10:56.242
Can't see a damn thing.

10:56.276 --> 10:58.945
I ain't feeling it.

10:58.979 --> 11:01.314
No smoke, no smell, no waste.

11:01.348 --> 11:02.949
There's no cook.

11:02.983 --> 11:04.984
Could be they're setting up.

11:05.018 --> 11:07.086
I heard movement inside.

11:07.120 --> 11:08.621
I say we call it a night,

11:08.655 --> 11:10.356
come back
with a search warrant.

11:10.390 --> 11:13.559
I'm not letting this sucker
out of my sight.

11:13.594 --> 11:16.429
There's got to be a way.

11:16.463 --> 11:19.031
There's got to be a way.
There's got to be a way.

11:24.638 --> 11:26.105
Hey-- Hey, hey.

12:18.525 --> 12:20.593
Oh, no, no, no, no.

12:20.627 --> 12:22.595
What the hell
you doing up there?

12:22.629 --> 12:24.964
You some kind of a pervert?
Shit.

12:45.953 --> 12:47.920
Go back to your trailers.
Everything's okay.

12:52.693 --> 12:54.260
Guy's VFW. He's cool.

12:54.294 --> 12:55.528
All right, I'll tell you what.

12:55.562 --> 12:56.963
We're gonna check out
a couple more.

12:56.997 --> 12:58.764
Then we're gonna call it a morning.
Okay? What do you say?

12:58.799 --> 13:00.466
Can't. Gotta get home.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.802
Why, you leave your balls
in your wife's purse or what?

13:04.004 --> 13:05.571
Gotta pack.

13:07.741 --> 13:09.075
Where you headed?

13:10.877 --> 13:11.911
Texas.

13:32.899 --> 13:33.966
Hey, there.

13:36.203 --> 13:37.937
Hank?

13:41.008 --> 13:42.942
Hank?

13:54.354 --> 13:56.088
Can I come in?

13:56.123 --> 13:58.491
Hey, babe.

13:58.525 --> 14:00.826
Hey.

14:00.861 --> 14:02.328
How did it go last night?

14:02.362 --> 14:03.462
Good.

14:03.497 --> 14:06.132
Catch the bad guys?

14:06.166 --> 14:08.634
Uh, nope.

14:08.668 --> 14:10.136
Want me to make you
some breakfast?

14:10.170 --> 14:13.272
Nah. I'm--

14:13.306 --> 14:15.541
I'm heading back out
after this.

14:15.575 --> 14:17.343
Now?

14:17.377 --> 14:19.011
You worked all night.

14:19.046 --> 14:20.513
Get some sleep, Hank.

14:20.547 --> 14:22.014
Those RVs
aren't going anywhere.

14:22.049 --> 14:24.183
They're recreational vehicles,
Marie.

14:24.217 --> 14:25.851
That's what they do.

14:25.886 --> 14:27.753
You know what I mean.

14:29.623 --> 14:31.924
I spoke with Blanca.

14:31.958 --> 14:35.628
She said that Steven's
going to El Paso?

14:39.399 --> 14:41.000
Yeah.

14:41.034 --> 14:44.937
I was just wondering
how you feel about that.

14:46.106 --> 14:47.239
I turned it down.

14:47.274 --> 14:48.507
End of story.

14:48.542 --> 14:49.975
Good, good.

14:50.010 --> 14:52.078
Jesus, God knows I'm relieved.

14:52.112 --> 14:53.846
Yeah, well, I needed
some time here

14:53.880 --> 14:55.581
because I'm deep
into this investigation

14:55.615 --> 14:57.983
and couldn't do both,

14:58.018 --> 14:59.652
so I made a judgment call.

15:06.927 --> 15:10.162
You know that you can talk
to me about things, right?

15:10.197 --> 15:12.698
You don't have to go
through this alone.

15:15.202 --> 15:17.703
Do you ask me which lead bib
to put on someone

15:17.737 --> 15:19.705
before you nuke them?

15:19.739 --> 15:21.207
Jesus, Marie.

15:22.209 --> 15:23.342
I made a decision.

15:23.376 --> 15:25.845
I'm not going through anything.

15:25.879 --> 15:28.247
I'm doing my job.

15:28.281 --> 15:29.648
I would like--

15:29.683 --> 15:32.718
I know, I know, a condo in Georgetown.
I know.

15:32.752 --> 15:34.120
If you would let me finish,

15:34.154 --> 15:38.924
I was going to say
I'd like to be included.

15:38.959 --> 15:40.893
That's all.

15:40.927 --> 15:43.462
Don't you worry
about my career.

15:43.497 --> 15:44.964
My career is just fine.

15:46.466 --> 15:48.100
Did you not want to go?

15:51.338 --> 15:52.972
I don't blame you.
I just--

15:53.006 --> 15:55.274
Aren't you late for work
or something?

15:55.308 --> 15:57.009
I mean,
what happened last time,

15:57.043 --> 15:58.244
it would make perfect sense

15:58.278 --> 15:59.678
for you to not want to go back.

15:59.713 --> 16:02.281
I'm on to some important
stuff right here, right now,

16:02.315 --> 16:04.416
and Mexico doesn't have
a damn thing to do with it.

16:04.451 --> 16:06.519
Anyone who doubts that--

16:06.553 --> 16:09.088
I'm doing some actual good
out here,

16:09.122 --> 16:11.157
and all I get are
these bullshit accusations!

16:11.191 --> 16:15.294
What, everyone thinks I'm jerking
off on this thing? Fine.

16:15.328 --> 16:17.296
But I'm onto something.
I know it.

16:17.330 --> 16:19.965
You understand me?

16:20.000 --> 16:21.867
You hear me?

16:29.175 --> 16:31.110
What exactly is this?

16:36.449 --> 16:38.584
I'll tell you
what I think it is.

16:42.155 --> 16:45.824
A ploy. A ploy to get me
cooking again...

16:45.859 --> 16:47.693
And an obvious one at that.

16:47.727 --> 16:50.396
How do you mean?

16:50.430 --> 16:52.531
As if I would seriously believe

16:52.565 --> 16:55.401
you would hire an addict.

16:55.435 --> 16:57.269
Jesse Pinkman?

16:57.303 --> 16:58.637
Recovering or not--

16:58.671 --> 17:00.539
You vouched for him previously.

17:00.573 --> 17:01.607
I took you at your word.

17:01.641 --> 17:03.642
No, no, no, no,
let me be clear.

17:03.676 --> 17:06.478
Let me be perfectly clear.

17:06.512 --> 17:10.582
Jesse was capable of working
under my supervision.

17:10.617 --> 17:15.387
Trusting him
with a solo venture,

17:15.422 --> 17:20.159
that's quite another matter.

17:20.193 --> 17:25.798
How he could possibly produce anything
other than a mediocre product at best.

17:25.832 --> 17:29.334
I am told his product was
more or less consistent

17:29.369 --> 17:32.004
with the quality
I had come to expect.

17:32.038 --> 17:34.840
More or less?

17:34.874 --> 17:38.043
More or less? Really?

17:38.077 --> 17:39.178
Wow.

17:40.280 --> 17:42.815
Boy, that is the--

17:42.849 --> 17:44.316
Talk about setting the bar low.

17:46.553 --> 17:49.254
Except you don't do that--

17:49.289 --> 17:52.724
set the bar low.

17:52.759 --> 17:58.096
Therefore, what conclusion
am I left to draw? Hm?

17:58.131 --> 18:00.098
That you believe

18:00.133 --> 18:03.635
I have some proprietary
kind of selfishness

18:03.670 --> 18:05.671
about my own formula.

18:05.705 --> 18:07.005
Hm?

18:07.040 --> 18:11.343
Some sort of overweening
pride, I suppose,

18:11.377 --> 18:12.678
that you think

18:12.712 --> 18:16.415
simply overwhelms me,

18:16.449 --> 18:19.318
clouds my judgment.

18:19.352 --> 18:20.652
But it doesn't.

18:20.687 --> 18:23.322
Absolutely not.

18:23.356 --> 18:25.991
I simply respect the chemistry.

18:27.627 --> 18:30.829
The chemistry
must be respected.

18:33.800 --> 18:36.235
I apologize for being
so transparent.

18:39.672 --> 18:42.374
Would you take a drive with me?

18:42.408 --> 18:44.376
I'd like to show you something.

19:28.588 --> 19:30.289
Hi. Is everything okay?

19:30.323 --> 19:33.091
She's already finished
an entire bottle,

19:33.126 --> 19:35.260
but she still seemed hungry.
Than she fell asleep.

19:35.295 --> 19:38.664
I was thinking I'd give her
another when she wakes up.

19:38.698 --> 19:40.232
Yeah-- yeah, yeah,
absolutely.

19:40.266 --> 19:42.401
Absolutely.
Fatten that baby up.

19:42.435 --> 19:44.236
<i>Will do.</i>

19:48.408 --> 19:51.043
Um...was that it?

19:51.077 --> 19:53.378
So where are you.
Are you at work?

19:53.413 --> 19:55.347
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I'm at work.</i>

19:55.381 --> 19:57.416
<i>I-- I shouldn't be
much longer.</i>

19:57.450 --> 19:58.984
<i>Is that okay?</i>

19:59.018 --> 20:01.086
You know I love
my little Pookums.

20:01.120 --> 20:03.322
You can leave her with me
for the next 18 years

20:03.356 --> 20:04.523
as far as I'm concerned.

20:04.557 --> 20:07.259
<i>Great.</i>

20:07.293 --> 20:09.461
Thanks, Marie.

20:12.699 --> 20:14.366
Are you-- Are you sure
you're okay?

20:16.336 --> 20:19.004
<i>Sweetie, what is it?</i>

20:19.038 --> 20:20.372
<i>Come on.</i>

20:20.406 --> 20:23.075
It's Hank.

20:23.109 --> 20:24.543
<i>What about him?</i>

20:24.577 --> 20:27.379
I don't know

20:27.413 --> 20:29.982
how to talk to him.

20:30.016 --> 20:31.817
I don't know
what to say to him anymore.

20:31.851 --> 20:33.785
I don't know how to--

20:33.820 --> 20:35.053
Ever since El Paso--

20:35.088 --> 20:39.024
Ever since maybe before...

20:39.058 --> 20:41.026
Yeah.

20:41.060 --> 20:43.962
God knows he went
through a lot down there.

20:43.997 --> 20:45.964
People blown up
right in front of him,

20:45.999 --> 20:49.735
blood everywhere,

20:49.769 --> 20:51.370
and last week

20:51.404 --> 20:52.604
El Paso said
they want him back.

20:52.639 --> 20:54.172
<i>Yeah?</i>

20:54.207 --> 20:57.676
He's not going.
Steve Gomez is going in his place, and...

20:59.245 --> 21:01.380
I don't know how I feel
about that.

21:03.449 --> 21:05.751
Well, he's certainly
a lot safer up here, isn't he?

21:05.785 --> 21:09.721
<i>Of course,
and I want him safe.</i>

21:09.756 --> 21:12.090
I can't tell what he wants.

21:12.125 --> 21:14.393
He won't talk to me.

21:14.427 --> 21:15.927
He hardly even comes home.

21:15.962 --> 21:17.462
He works all day, all night.

21:17.497 --> 21:20.265
Barely eats,
barely speaks to me.

21:20.299 --> 21:23.268
<i>It's like something's
eating him away from inside.</i>

21:23.302 --> 21:25.270
He's just not the same.

21:25.304 --> 21:28.674
He's not.

21:28.708 --> 21:30.709
Facing death,
it changes a person.

21:30.743 --> 21:33.278
It has to, don't you think?

21:33.312 --> 21:37.215
I guess you've notice
a change in Walt.

22:08.581 --> 22:09.715
Please.

23:26.759 --> 23:27.959
What is this?

23:31.097 --> 23:32.597
Your new lab.

24:10.236 --> 24:11.770
My God.

24:23.616 --> 24:26.318
Thorium oxide...

24:26.352 --> 24:29.554
for a catalyst bed.

24:31.157 --> 24:34.392
Look at the size
of this reaction vessel.

24:34.427 --> 24:35.861
Why, that's got--

24:35.895 --> 24:38.163
that's got to be 1,200 liters.

24:41.701 --> 24:43.134
Where-- Where--

24:43.169 --> 24:47.405
How did you know how
to put this all together?

24:47.440 --> 24:49.407
I had excellent help,

24:49.442 --> 24:51.343
as will you.

24:54.380 --> 24:56.114
Quite a lot of planning
went into this.

24:57.316 --> 25:00.518
I would say so.

25:00.553 --> 25:01.853
The laundry upstairs--

25:01.888 --> 25:03.455
I've owned it for years.

25:03.489 --> 25:06.591
It receives large chemical
deliveries on a weekly basis--

25:06.626 --> 25:08.126
detergent and such.

25:08.160 --> 25:11.363
There is
nothing suspicious about it,

25:11.397 --> 25:15.467
and my employees, to be sure,
are well-trained, trustworthy.

25:17.403 --> 25:20.005
The filtration system
is state-of-the-art.

25:20.039 --> 25:23.375
It will vent nothing
but clean, odorless steam,

25:23.409 --> 25:25.243
just as the laundry does,

25:25.278 --> 25:27.412
and through
the very same stacks.

25:29.315 --> 25:33.018
I need 200 pounds per week

25:33.052 --> 25:35.220
to make this
economically viable.

25:36.722 --> 25:38.890
You would choose
your own hours, of course,

25:38.925 --> 25:41.559
come and go as you please

25:41.594 --> 25:43.728
so long as the quota is met.

26:04.183 --> 26:05.550
Sorry.

26:06.686 --> 26:08.219
The answer is still no.

26:14.493 --> 26:19.998
I have made a series
of very bad decisions,

26:20.032 --> 26:22.267
and I cannot make another one.

26:22.301 --> 26:24.502
Why did you make
these decisions?

26:24.537 --> 26:27.105
For the good of my family.

26:27.139 --> 26:29.908
Then they weren't
bad decisions.

26:32.478 --> 26:35.747
What does a man do, Walter?

26:39.018 --> 26:42.187
A man provides for his family.

26:42.221 --> 26:45.190
This cost me my family.

26:45.224 --> 26:48.293
When you have children,
you always have family.

26:48.327 --> 26:51.496
They will always be your
priority, your responsibility,

26:51.530 --> 26:55.600
and a man-- a man provides.

26:58.738 --> 26:59.904
And he does it

26:59.939 --> 27:02.741
even when he's not appreciated

27:02.775 --> 27:05.176
or respected

27:05.211 --> 27:07.445
or even loved.

27:07.480 --> 27:11.249
He simply bears up,
and he does it...

27:13.552 --> 27:15.487
because he's a man.

27:34.057 --> 27:37.593
Any chance we could
grab a quick bite?

27:37.628 --> 27:39.662
Thai place around
the corner's pretty good.

27:39.696 --> 27:42.965
Um, I really gotta head home.

27:44.101 --> 27:45.968
All right, rain check, then.

28:07.491 --> 28:08.891
She said it was the tofu.

28:12.863 --> 28:15.665
Whatever.
She's still cute anyways.

28:19.002 --> 28:24.440
Uh, great-- great dinner, Mom.

28:24.474 --> 28:25.508
Yeah.

28:28.312 --> 28:31.614
Um, can I be--
can I be excused?

28:31.648 --> 28:34.283
To do homework
or to play videogames?

28:34.318 --> 28:36.252
I can multitask.

28:38.088 --> 28:39.588
Yeah.

28:39.623 --> 28:40.990
Go ahead.

29:28.538 --> 29:29.772
You want to take her?

29:39.449 --> 29:41.217
Yeah.

30:14.151 --> 30:15.818
Mm-hm.

30:41.945 --> 30:44.747
Give me something, Andy.
Come on.

30:44.781 --> 30:46.949
Please tell me you're joking.

30:51.822 --> 30:56.058
Welded onto the back of a house.
Wow, that's classy.

30:56.093 --> 30:57.726
Christ.

30:58.795 --> 31:01.030
Okay. Okay, thanks.

31:14.044 --> 31:15.678
Hey, Janice. Janice.

31:19.015 --> 31:20.249
That the last one?

31:20.283 --> 31:21.484
Yeah.

31:21.518 --> 31:23.452
Sorry, hank.
That's all DMV had--

31:23.487 --> 31:26.622
29 early '80s Bounders
registered in New Mexico.

31:27.691 --> 31:28.724
Could you check again?

31:28.758 --> 31:31.660
Now?

31:31.695 --> 31:33.462
Can I do it after the party?

31:33.497 --> 31:35.731
Janice, I'm--

31:35.765 --> 31:37.233
I'm dead in the water here.

31:37.267 --> 31:39.935
Okay, I'll check.

31:39.970 --> 31:41.770
Thanks.

31:58.321 --> 32:02.658
Gomie, time for the little
bird to fly the nest, huh?

32:04.461 --> 32:05.995
They got the right guy
for the job,

32:06.029 --> 32:08.464
specially since the bean-speak
comes natural and all.

32:08.498 --> 32:10.966
Wanna know how to say
"Get bent" in Spanish?

32:12.202 --> 32:13.903
Just don't go native on me,
all right?

32:17.073 --> 32:19.175
Oh, uh--

32:19.209 --> 32:22.011
Hey, uh--

32:22.045 --> 32:23.746
here.

32:26.049 --> 32:27.516
Know your enemy and all.

32:36.560 --> 32:38.727
Fight the good fight, brother.

32:38.762 --> 32:40.029
I will.

32:42.199 --> 32:43.966
What have we got to drink
around here?

32:53.843 --> 32:55.177
Your hunch was right.

32:55.212 --> 32:57.880
One more RV.

32:57.914 --> 33:00.382
DMV said the registration
wasn't renewed,

33:00.417 --> 33:02.218
but then they realized
it was never filed

33:02.252 --> 33:04.620
as non-operational
or destroyed.

33:04.654 --> 33:06.121
No police report, either.

34:32.809 --> 34:33.942
I just don't know

34:33.976 --> 34:36.879
what the hell
I'm doing anymore, you know?

34:36.913 --> 34:39.782
It's like I'm paralyzed,

34:39.815 --> 34:42.583
like if I take a step
in any direction,

34:42.619 --> 34:46.688
I'm going to make
a spectacular mistake.

34:48.725 --> 34:51.126
God, I could go
for a glass of wine about now.

34:52.661 --> 34:54.897
You want to go to--

34:54.931 --> 34:56.331
Sorry, never mind.

34:59.336 --> 35:03.472
Anyway, breaking news is

35:03.506 --> 35:06.108
I am sleeping with my boss,

35:06.142 --> 35:08.744
and I don't know why.

35:08.778 --> 35:10.679
Wow.
Yep.

35:15.585 --> 35:16.652
That's a lie.

35:16.686 --> 35:18.354
I do know why.

35:21.858 --> 35:24.093
I mean, he's a lovely guy.

35:24.127 --> 35:27.663
He's--
He's a really good person,

35:27.697 --> 35:30.366
but, I mean, it's not
like we're ever gonna--

35:33.737 --> 35:36.972
Somehow, and I can't
actually believe it,

35:37.006 --> 35:40.042
but my entire family

35:40.076 --> 35:42.044
sees me as some sort of--

35:44.447 --> 35:45.814
my own sister,

35:45.849 --> 35:47.249
my brother-in-law.

35:47.283 --> 35:50.119
My teenage son

35:50.153 --> 35:51.587
tells me I'm a bitch.

35:53.957 --> 35:57.092
And you say tell him the truth.

35:58.361 --> 36:01.997
Tell him about his father,

36:02.031 --> 36:05.534
but I can't...ever.

36:07.070 --> 36:08.570
How could I?

36:08.605 --> 36:10.139
And this man that I'm seeing,

36:10.173 --> 36:13.475
you know,
as wrong as I know it is,

36:13.510 --> 36:15.377
as much as I know
I'm probably doing it

36:15.412 --> 36:16.712
just to make Walt leave me,

36:16.746 --> 36:21.150
it is the only thing in my day

36:21.184 --> 36:23.218
where I don't feel...

36:26.055 --> 36:29.091
like I'm...

36:30.126 --> 36:31.627
drowning.

36:34.431 --> 36:38.700
So he knows
about this other man?

36:38.735 --> 36:40.302
Yeah.

36:40.336 --> 36:44.373
So then he'll sign?

36:44.407 --> 36:49.011
Um, Walt says
he's not going anywhere,

36:49.045 --> 36:50.145
so that's a--

36:50.180 --> 36:52.481
that's a really brilliant
gambit on my part.

36:52.515 --> 36:54.149
Yep.

36:54.184 --> 36:55.951
Genius.

37:05.528 --> 37:07.296
He keeps money in the house.

37:09.666 --> 37:12.267
Your husband, the drug dealer?

37:12.302 --> 37:15.003
How much money?

37:15.038 --> 37:16.872
I didn't count it.

37:16.906 --> 37:18.907
It's-- It's heavy.

37:20.610 --> 37:22.945
The bag where he keeps it.

37:25.515 --> 37:29.184
Are you asking my permission
to spend this money?

37:29.219 --> 37:31.019
No. God, no.

37:31.054 --> 37:34.022
I-- No, I'm just, you know--

37:34.057 --> 37:37.593
I'm just trying to just
talk it through. That's--

37:37.627 --> 37:40.162
Let me just say
that I'm half as qualified

37:40.196 --> 37:42.097
and twice the price
of a therapist.

37:42.131 --> 37:44.266
There is nothing
to discuss here, Skyler.

37:44.300 --> 37:45.601
I'm just saying, you know?

37:45.635 --> 37:49.004
We have a history.

37:49.038 --> 37:51.206
He's the father of my children,

37:51.241 --> 37:54.243
and maybe what he did, he--

37:54.277 --> 37:57.412
He did it for the family.
Right?

37:57.447 --> 37:58.647
Well, guess what.

37:58.681 --> 38:01.450
That is one enormous load
of horse shit.

38:01.484 --> 38:03.051
Okay.

38:03.086 --> 38:05.988
I'm going to spell this out
as simply as I can for you.

38:06.022 --> 38:07.723
You are a fool

38:07.757 --> 38:09.157
to stay in that house

38:09.192 --> 38:11.360
one minute longer.

38:11.394 --> 38:13.762
If your husband won't leave,
then you go.

38:13.796 --> 38:16.398
You are now an accessory
after the fact.

38:16.432 --> 38:17.599
You are culpable.

38:17.634 --> 38:18.867
You, your children,

38:18.902 --> 38:21.003
you could lose everything
you own.

38:21.037 --> 38:23.238
Do you understand?

38:23.273 --> 38:26.208
All courtesy of this criminal

38:26.242 --> 38:28.777
you refuse to divorce.

38:28.811 --> 38:30.646
I didn't marry a criminal.

38:30.680 --> 38:33.148
Well, you're married
to one now.

39:51.508 --> 39:53.542
Hows about we run through
this thing one more time,

39:53.577 --> 39:55.478
especially the part
where I do all the talking

39:55.512 --> 39:56.679
and you don't say jack?

39:56.713 --> 39:58.381
Oh, I'm going to say jack.

39:58.415 --> 39:59.582
I'm going to say plenty.

39:59.616 --> 40:02.051
What did we say about
escalating, huh?

40:02.085 --> 40:03.519
Who's got your back here, hm?

40:03.553 --> 40:05.821
Me. All right?
I'm going to take care of things.

40:05.856 --> 40:09.325
Hey, what are the parameters of
this sobriety thing you got going?

40:09.359 --> 40:10.659
What do you mean?

40:10.694 --> 40:11.927
Can you take a Xanax?

40:11.962 --> 40:13.162
'Cause I got
a drawer full of them.

40:13.196 --> 40:17.166
I get them
from my "chiropractor."

40:17.200 --> 40:19.502
Vietnamese, 5 foot tall,

40:19.536 --> 40:22.204
she adjusts you to completion.

40:22.239 --> 40:25.107
Her name's Kim Nu Suong,

40:25.142 --> 40:29.512
as delicious as it sounds.

40:29.546 --> 40:32.148
I should give you her card.

40:32.182 --> 40:34.383
To hell with this.

40:34.418 --> 40:37.887
Uh--

40:37.921 --> 40:39.789
Send him in.

40:43.960 --> 40:45.494
Hello, Walt.

40:45.529 --> 40:46.629
Good to see you.

40:46.663 --> 40:51.233
Please, have a seat...
here.

40:51.268 --> 40:53.135
Mr. Pinkman, if you will.

40:55.138 --> 40:56.505
You're late.

40:56.540 --> 41:00.609
Gentlemen, if we could come
to some accommodation here now.

41:00.644 --> 41:02.411
There's always a way to oil
everyone's lock.

41:02.446 --> 41:04.447
This young man

41:04.481 --> 41:05.948
is prepared to offer you

41:05.982 --> 41:07.216
a sweetheart of a deal

41:07.250 --> 41:09.685
doing precisely nothing.

41:09.719 --> 41:10.886
Really?

41:10.921 --> 41:12.922
10 percent
of all future profits

41:12.956 --> 41:15.658
from his solo venture

41:15.692 --> 41:17.026
is money you get paid

41:17.060 --> 41:18.761
for walking down
to the mailbox.

41:20.097 --> 41:22.131
Consider it
a gesture of respect

41:22.165 --> 41:23.866
for your valuable contributions

41:23.900 --> 41:25.134
to the business thus far.

41:25.168 --> 41:27.703
I'm sure you'll agree
that's fair.

41:27.737 --> 41:30.906
That's charity,
is what that is.

41:30.941 --> 41:32.641
I do all the work.

41:32.676 --> 41:35.678
He sits around on his fat a--
judging people.

41:35.712 --> 41:38.047
Hey, hey, hey. Escalating.

41:38.081 --> 41:39.448
Stop.

41:39.483 --> 41:41.016
Sohere's that,

41:41.051 --> 41:43.252
but then there's
one small detail.

41:43.286 --> 41:45.354
Clearly a mistake was made

41:45.388 --> 41:46.956
on the part
of our mutual associate

41:46.990 --> 41:49.458
when he paid you half
of Jesse's earnings.

41:49.493 --> 41:51.227
He must not have realized
that you two

41:51.261 --> 41:53.129
had come to a parting
of the ways.

41:53.163 --> 41:56.132
Take it.
It belongs to you.

41:56.166 --> 41:58.634
You're damn right
it belongs to me.

41:58.668 --> 42:01.303
I knew I could count
on you boys to play nice.

42:01.338 --> 42:03.873
That's-- That almost brings
a tear to my eye.

42:03.907 --> 42:07.276
Enjoy it.
Spend it in good health.

42:07.310 --> 42:11.947
That is the last money you'll
ever earn in this business.

42:11.982 --> 42:14.049
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

42:14.084 --> 42:18.320
Well, I hate to break it
to you, Jesse,

42:18.355 --> 42:21.824
but our mutual associate

42:21.858 --> 42:26.128
was only using you
to get to me.

42:26.163 --> 42:27.363
What are you talking about?

42:27.397 --> 42:32.568
You see, he needs someone
with expertise,

42:32.602 --> 42:35.137
someone
who knows what he's doing.

42:35.172 --> 42:38.874
In other words, he needs me.

42:38.909 --> 42:41.610
You're telling me
you're cooking again?

42:41.645 --> 42:43.946
Yeah, uh--

42:43.980 --> 42:45.347
How should I put this?

42:47.350 --> 42:51.520
I'm in. You're out.

42:54.891 --> 42:57.526
Whoa, whoa, Walt,
hold on there.

42:57.561 --> 42:58.961
Uh, what was the offer,

42:58.995 --> 43:01.730
if I may ask?

43:01.765 --> 43:04.567
It's, uh, 3 million

43:04.601 --> 43:06.602
for three months of my time.

43:06.636 --> 43:08.938
What You're gonna need
that money laundered, right?

43:08.972 --> 43:10.239
I mean, of course.

43:10.273 --> 43:11.574
What was our deal before?

43:11.608 --> 43:13.509
17 percent.
That's a shade high.

43:13.543 --> 43:15.711
Let's settle on an even 15.

43:15.745 --> 43:17.112
That's a nice round number.

43:17.147 --> 43:18.347
5 percent.

43:18.381 --> 43:19.815
14's fair.
5.

43:19.849 --> 43:21.283
13.
5.

43:21.318 --> 43:22.985
12.
For old time's sake, 12.

43:23.019 --> 43:24.620
5.

43:24.654 --> 43:27.423
I'm a reasonable guy.
It's a short-term deal.

43:27.457 --> 43:29.625
10 even, but I can't go
any lower

43:29.659 --> 43:31.060
and still respect myself.

43:31.094 --> 43:33.596
5. What in the hell
just happened?

43:33.630 --> 43:36.332
You're my lawyer, not his!

43:36.366 --> 43:37.833
That's the way
of the world, kid.

43:37.867 --> 43:40.002
You go with the winner.

43:40.036 --> 43:42.037
You think this'll stop me
from cooking?

43:42.072 --> 43:44.039
Cook whatever you like...

43:44.074 --> 43:48.110
As long as it's that ridiculous
"Chili P" or some other drek,

43:48.144 --> 43:51.647
but don't even think
about using my formula.

43:51.681 --> 43:54.850
Just try and stop me, bitch.

44:45.568 --> 44:46.669
Yes?

44:46.703 --> 44:48.003
Hi, there, uh, Mrs. Ortega?

44:48.038 --> 44:49.038
Yes.

44:49.072 --> 44:50.372
Hi, I'm Hank Schrader.

44:50.407 --> 44:52.274
I'm with the Drug
Enforcement Administration.

44:52.309 --> 44:54.643
We're interested in an RV

44:54.678 --> 44:56.712
that's registered
to your name and address.

44:56.746 --> 44:59.515
Uh, do you have an RV?

44:59.549 --> 45:00.783
I did.

45:00.817 --> 45:02.718
It was stolen months ago.

45:02.752 --> 45:06.422
Stolen, huh?

45:06.456 --> 45:09.825
Well, then I'm curious as to why
the theft was never reported.

45:09.859 --> 45:11.360
I'm not seeing any records
of it with the police

45:11.394 --> 45:12.594
or the DMV.

45:12.629 --> 45:15.731
I just...
didn't get around to it.

45:15.765 --> 45:17.232
May I ask why?

45:19.002 --> 45:22.104
I mean it's a-- it's a great
way to get the family together

45:22.138 --> 45:23.605
for an affordable vacation.

45:23.640 --> 45:25.607
It must've been quite a blow
when it went missing.

45:25.642 --> 45:28.877
It was.

45:28.912 --> 45:30.579
Do you have any ideas at all

45:30.613 --> 45:32.014
who might've taken it?

45:34.384 --> 45:36.952
I didn't want him arrested.

45:36.986 --> 45:38.354
He ran with a bad crowd,

45:38.388 --> 45:41.457
but he was never a bad person.

45:41.491 --> 45:44.126
I thought he could
turn his life around.

45:44.160 --> 45:46.028
Who are we talking about,
Mrs. Ortega?

45:46.062 --> 45:48.997
My son.

45:49.032 --> 45:52.401
I'd really like to speak
with him.

45:52.435 --> 45:53.836
He's passed away.

45:53.870 --> 45:55.971
He was shot two months ago.

45:58.274 --> 45:59.641
What was your son's name?

45:59.676 --> 46:00.709
Christian.

46:00.744 --> 46:04.747
Christian Ortega.

46:04.781 --> 46:07.483
Was his nickname "Combo"?

46:15.925 --> 46:18.193
Thanks for this.
I really appreciate it.
