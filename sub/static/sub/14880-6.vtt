<i>Previously on</i>
Covert Affairs...

00:01.867 --> 00:03.556
I'm sending you
back to the DPD.

00:03.723 --> 00:05.557
But this mission
isn't dead yet.

00:05.559 --> 00:07.092
Langley has asked me
to evaluate your well-being

00:07.094 --> 00:08.260
in the field.

00:08.262 --> 00:09.261
Who ordered the assessment?

00:09.263 --> 00:10.462
I can't marry you.

00:10.464 --> 00:12.197
You should have this back.

00:12.199 --> 00:14.299
Good-bye, Auggie.

00:16.436 --> 00:17.769
You'll begin therapy.

00:17.771 --> 00:19.104
This is mandated.

00:19.106 --> 00:21.073
I didn't need it
after my injury,

00:21.075 --> 00:23.775
and I don't need it now.

01:22.201 --> 01:24.836
Yesterday, Yemeni
Prime Minister A'zam Halabi

01:24.838 --> 01:26.405
suffered a heart attack.

01:26.407 --> 01:28.607
State is allowing him
to enter the U.S.

01:28.609 --> 01:29.941
for medical treatment only.

01:29.943 --> 01:31.610
He's currently en route
to the Mayo Clinic,

01:31.612 --> 01:33.679
where he will undergo surgery
later today.

01:33.681 --> 01:36.648
This is a special situation.
We defer to State.

01:36.650 --> 01:38.183
No planned action
at this time.

01:38.185 --> 01:39.551
What are we getting
in return?

01:39.553 --> 01:41.586
I assume it has to do
with oil.

01:41.588 --> 01:43.522
It does have something to do
with oil.

01:43.524 --> 01:47.292
Yemen is not an OPEC nation.
They make their own deals.

01:47.294 --> 01:48.960
So State is trading
lower gas prices

01:48.962 --> 01:50.462
for a man's life.

01:50.464 --> 01:53.065
Is that why the CIA isn't
allowed anywhere near the place?

01:53.067 --> 01:54.666
They're worried
we'll mess up the deal?

01:54.668 --> 01:57.002
While the prime minister's
here in the country,

01:57.004 --> 02:00.038
I'd like to try and turn
his Chief of Staff.

02:00.040 --> 02:03.341
His name is Sayid al-Muqri,

02:03.343 --> 02:05.310
and I think he could be
a valuable asset.

02:05.312 --> 02:06.645
Annie, you're not the first
person in this building

02:06.647 --> 02:08.547
who's wanted to turn
Sayid al-Muqri.

02:08.549 --> 02:11.917
I've been following him, and
I think he could be a friend.

02:11.919 --> 02:13.452
How so?

02:13.454 --> 02:15.253
When he was a grad student
at Oxford in 2000,

02:15.255 --> 02:17.589
an editorial appeared
<i>Political Analysis.</i>

02:17.591 --> 02:20.392
The article condemned
the attack on the <i>U.S.S. Cole</i>

02:20.394 --> 02:22.194
and called for greater
collaboration

02:22.196 --> 02:23.695
between Yemen and the west.

02:23.697 --> 02:25.564
And although there was no byline
to the editorial,

02:25.566 --> 02:27.733
I could hear his voice
in the article.

02:27.735 --> 02:33.138
If he wrote it,
I think he could be turned.

02:33.140 --> 02:34.673
I'd like to make the play.

02:34.675 --> 02:38.043
Halabi took in al-Muqri
when his parents died.

02:38.045 --> 02:39.478
They're like family.

02:39.480 --> 02:41.580
Al-Muqri will definitely be
traveling with him.

02:41.582 --> 02:43.415
Surgery lasts three hours.

02:43.417 --> 02:45.584
After which they get on a plane
straight back to Yemen.

02:45.586 --> 02:47.586
It's a very short window
of time.

02:47.588 --> 02:48.987
How do you plan
to approach?

02:48.989 --> 02:51.490
A cold pitch.

02:51.492 --> 02:52.858
It's the only way,
given the time frame.

02:52.860 --> 02:54.192
So you think
you can turn

02:54.194 --> 02:55.861
the prime minister's
right-hand man

02:55.863 --> 02:57.996
based on an article
he might not have written.

02:57.998 --> 02:59.731
He's being under-utilized
at home.

02:59.733 --> 03:02.601
He's ambitious,
and he's itching to do more,

03:02.603 --> 03:05.103
to find a bigger way
to contribute.

03:05.105 --> 03:07.272
We could be that way.

03:08.674 --> 03:11.443
But the risk is too high
and the timeline too short.

03:11.445 --> 03:15.747
So let's move on.

03:19.186 --> 03:22.754
- May I have a moment, please?
- Sure.

03:22.756 --> 03:24.156
I wanted to give you a copy

03:24.158 --> 03:26.158
of the brief I wrote
on Sayid al-Muqri.

03:26.160 --> 03:27.759
Maybe it'll change your mind.

03:27.761 --> 03:29.294
Annie, your interest
in this individual

03:29.296 --> 03:30.829
is not the issue here.

03:30.831 --> 03:34.432
We don't have
a single asset in Yemen.

03:34.434 --> 03:36.968
The CIA's decided the whole
country's a black hole,

03:36.970 --> 03:39.137
that no Yemeni man or woman
would ever work with us.

03:39.139 --> 03:42.607
I don't accept that.
Do you?

03:42.609 --> 03:45.744
I am not responsible
for CIA policy.

03:45.746 --> 03:47.946
I am responsible for you,

03:47.948 --> 03:50.749
and I am not prepared
to send you into a situation

03:50.751 --> 03:52.250
that's primed for you to fail.

03:52.252 --> 03:54.186
Never mind the State
doesn't want us

03:54.188 --> 03:55.754
to jeopardize their deal.

03:55.756 --> 03:59.024
What you are proposing
is akin to flying to Cuba

03:59.026 --> 04:01.459
for three hours
to try to turn Castro's son.

04:01.461 --> 04:04.396
Sayid and I may have grown up
on opposite sides of the globe,

04:04.398 --> 04:07.432
but we both raised ourselves in
the absence of strong parents.

04:07.434 --> 04:10.569
We traveled by ourselves,
we learned other languages,

04:10.571 --> 04:14.039
we chose a life of service
to our nations.

04:14.041 --> 04:15.540
I may not have met him yet,

04:15.542 --> 04:19.511
but I already know
how to speak to him.

04:24.650 --> 04:28.887
If anyone
from State Department sees you,

04:28.889 --> 04:31.590
you will turn around
and fly home.

04:31.592 --> 04:35.460
If you meet with Sayid
and he turns you down,

04:35.462 --> 04:36.962
you will fly home.

04:36.964 --> 04:39.698
If you even think
you're about to get caught,

04:39.700 --> 04:41.867
you will fly home.

04:43.603 --> 04:44.936
That's a yes?

04:44.938 --> 04:47.939
You have three hours.
Don't make me regret this.

04:53.179 --> 04:55.614
Good luck, Annie.

You only say that when
you wanna talk about something.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.007
Whey do you assume I wanna
talk to you about anything,

05:43.009 --> 05:44.675
particularly
about Joan's decision

05:44.677 --> 05:46.010
to let you do this mission?

05:46.012 --> 05:47.211
How could you know
she gave me the Op?

05:47.213 --> 05:48.346
That just happened.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.614
Because I know you,

05:49.616 --> 05:50.848
and when you believe
in something,

05:50.850 --> 05:52.617
whole armies won't stop you.

05:52.619 --> 05:56.354
Which is why, despite your
attempts to keep things quiet,

05:56.356 --> 05:58.256
I know about Parker...

05:58.258 --> 06:00.057
and what happened at Allen's.

06:00.059 --> 06:01.859
Well...

06:01.861 --> 06:03.728
She flipped the script.
She did.

06:03.730 --> 06:05.763
Are you okay?
I'm fine.

06:05.765 --> 06:07.131
Auggie.

06:07.133 --> 06:09.367
I'm going to be fine.
Now you have a plane to catch.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.502
We're gonna talk about this,
all right?

06:11.504 --> 06:14.672
Drinks at Allen's this week.

06:14.674 --> 06:16.007
We might need to find
a new place.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.842
But hey, variety's
the spice of life, right?

06:17.844 --> 06:21.512
Now I am going to get blamed
for undermining your Op.

06:21.514 --> 06:22.880
I'm sure Joan will find
some other reason

06:22.882 --> 06:24.315
to keep me in the doghouse.

06:24.317 --> 06:25.917
What is going on
between you two?

06:25.919 --> 06:28.419
The friction's so palpable,
I'm almost glad I can't see it.

06:28.421 --> 06:32.156
She asked Eyal Lavin
for a full cogent profile on me.

06:32.158 --> 06:34.659
Well, you have been through
a lot lately.

06:34.661 --> 06:36.360
Maybe she just wants
to make sure you're doing okay.

06:36.362 --> 06:37.962
Eyal knows you well.

06:37.964 --> 06:39.130
That's what he said.

06:39.132 --> 06:41.299
Well, it just might be true.

06:41.301 --> 06:42.733
You sound like you're
on her side.

06:42.735 --> 06:45.903
I'm on your side.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.172
Which reminds me why I wanted
to talk to you.

06:48.174 --> 06:49.240
Oh, you admit it.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.576
You do wanna talk to me
about something.

06:51.578 --> 06:54.145
What can I say?
I'm a talker.

06:54.147 --> 06:57.114
What you're about to do
is a huge gamble.

06:57.116 --> 06:59.917
If you get there
and decide not to go for it,

06:59.919 --> 07:03.487
I won't think any less of you.
No one will.

07:03.489 --> 07:05.790
I know what I'm doing.

07:06.793 --> 07:10.962
Like I said--
whole armies.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.296
Call me when you land.

07:25.544 --> 07:28.212
Halabi will be arriving
by a private medical jet,

07:28.214 --> 07:29.981
pre-cleared for landing
by the FAA.

07:31.050 --> 07:33.150
So hit me.
What are my roadblocks?

07:33.152 --> 07:34.652
Sayid and Halabi
will be traveling

07:34.654 --> 07:36.687
with a small protection detail,

07:36.689 --> 07:38.990
but your real problem
will be the State Department.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.834
So the scary part is that
they bought out the whole wing

07:49.836 --> 07:51.168
or the whole floor?

07:51.170 --> 07:52.536
Neither.

07:52.538 --> 07:54.538
A shutdown on any level
would draw too much attention,

07:54.540 --> 07:56.207
and they don't want anyone
poking around

07:56.209 --> 07:58.175
while we treat the leader
of a hostile nation,

07:58.177 --> 07:59.777
and I mean <i>anyone.</i>

07:59.779 --> 08:03.447
The public, the press, or
your friendly neighborhood CIA.

08:03.449 --> 08:04.882
I got to admit.

08:04.884 --> 08:06.083
It seems a little
counterproductive,

08:06.085 --> 08:07.318
working against
our own government.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.187
Yes, why can't we all
just get along?

08:10.189 --> 08:11.956
Come home safe and unseen.

08:11.958 --> 08:13.658
You can rant
about bureaucracy later.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.760
It's not a rant.
It's a difference of opinion.

08:15.762 --> 08:18.195
Spoken like an operative,
all fired up to turn an asset.

08:18.197 --> 08:19.597
You got a game plan ready?

08:19.599 --> 08:21.732
Yeah, I think I'm gonna go
with the basic version.

08:21.734 --> 08:23.434
Everyone has a favorite vice.

08:23.436 --> 08:26.604
Well, looks like you're gonna
have to wait to hear about mine.

08:26.606 --> 08:28.172
They've just begun
the procedure.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.975
Your three-hour countdown
starts now.

08:30.977 --> 08:34.078
Okay.
Here I go.

09:23.862 --> 09:25.196
Sir, I'm sorry.

09:25.198 --> 09:28.599
Smoking's not permitted
in or around the hospital.

09:28.601 --> 09:30.334
Claim this
is a free country.

09:37.376 --> 09:39.243
It's hard waiting
for important news

09:39.245 --> 09:40.845
without a cigarette.

09:40.847 --> 09:43.114
You must know some secret.

09:43.116 --> 09:46.183
No secrets.

09:46.185 --> 09:48.185
I know a spot--

09:48.187 --> 09:49.987
probably the only spot--
where they'll let you smoke.

09:49.989 --> 09:52.323
- I'm okay.
- Not here.

09:52.325 --> 09:55.159
Mayo Clinic is the size
of a college campus,

09:55.160 --> 09:58.375
and security has a problem with
smoking for some unknown reason.

10:07.048 --> 10:08.876
Where?

10:10.675 --> 10:14.044
Out this door.

10:29.094 --> 10:30.795
- It's a good spot.
- Yeah.

10:39.938 --> 10:43.674
<i>As-salaam alaikum,</i>
<i>Mr. al-Muqri.</i>

10:43.676 --> 10:45.009
I've been looking forward
to meeting you.

10:45.011 --> 10:46.710
Forgive me,
we don't have a lot of time.

10:46.712 --> 10:48.646
Unbelievable.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.848
The CIA can't even let
a sick man see a doctor.

10:50.850 --> 10:52.750
We're welcoming to see
the best doctor in the world.

10:52.752 --> 10:54.251
At tremendous cost.

10:54.253 --> 10:56.854
We're just having
a conversation.

10:56.856 --> 10:58.689
Conversations with the CIA
are never free.

10:58.691 --> 11:00.090
We haven't demanded
anything.

11:00.092 --> 11:01.826
The CIA and the State Department
are too separate things.

11:01.828 --> 11:05.763
That's a distinction
you like to make, isn't it?

11:05.765 --> 11:07.698
I don't know which operatives
you've met in the past,

11:07.700 --> 11:09.433
but I'm not them.

11:09.435 --> 11:11.035
No, you're blonde.

11:11.037 --> 11:13.671
Perhaps someone now thinks
that's my type.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.307
There's no agency plot here,
Mr. al-Muqri.

11:16.309 --> 11:17.675
We have things in common,

11:17.677 --> 11:19.543
and so I came to see you
on my own terms.

11:19.545 --> 11:22.680
The only thing worse
than a CIA operative

11:22.682 --> 11:24.648
is a CIA operative
with a personal agenda.

11:24.650 --> 11:25.950
We have a shared agenda.

11:25.952 --> 11:28.853
"The distance between villages
is short."

11:28.855 --> 11:31.655
You wrote that,
and I believe it.

11:31.657 --> 11:33.157
That we are all related.

11:33.159 --> 11:35.726
I didn't write that,
but okay.

11:35.728 --> 11:37.428
We're great friends.

11:37.430 --> 11:38.762
Great friends
who pounce on each other

11:38.764 --> 11:40.097
in moments of crisis.

11:40.099 --> 11:41.599
The man who I have sworn
to serve faithfully

11:41.601 --> 11:43.133
is fighting for his life
downstairs,

11:43.135 --> 11:44.502
and you see that
as a political opportunity.

11:44.504 --> 11:46.504
I see this as the only
opportunity to speak with you

11:46.506 --> 11:48.973
to convince you that we have
a chance to change things.

11:48.975 --> 11:52.910
Spoken like an American.
All promise and hope.

11:52.912 --> 11:54.078
No regard for risk.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.980
- We're both at risk here.
- No.

11:55.982 --> 11:57.615
I am the one standing
in a hostile nation

11:57.617 --> 11:58.983
under careful watch.

11:58.985 --> 12:02.019
I have traveled far
and fought hard

12:02.021 --> 12:03.888
to stand here with you.

12:05.190 --> 12:07.858
I don't even know
your name.

12:07.860 --> 12:09.593
You know everything
about me.

12:09.595 --> 12:11.228
I'm exposed and vulnerable,

12:11.230 --> 12:13.831
while you remain anonymous
and protected.

12:13.833 --> 12:16.033
How can you have
a conversation with me

12:16.035 --> 12:19.436
and hide your identity
at the same time?

12:19.438 --> 12:21.906
How can I connect
with you...

12:21.908 --> 12:24.909
When you haven't even
shared with me your name?

12:28.313 --> 12:30.681
Annie Walker.

12:33.451 --> 12:35.019
How do I know
that's the truth?

12:35.021 --> 12:37.655
Because it's the truth.

12:43.595 --> 12:45.563
Do not approach me again...

12:45.565 --> 12:47.965
Annie Walker.

13:23.987 --> 13:26.554
There she is.
Go, go.

13:49.278 --> 13:52.180
Arthur Campbell
or Joan?

13:52.182 --> 13:53.348
Uh, excuse me.

13:53.350 --> 13:54.883
I'm asking you
a question.

13:54.885 --> 13:57.152
Who sent you?

13:57.154 --> 13:58.486
I don't--I don't know
what you mean.

13:58.488 --> 13:59.888
All right,
you can play it that way.

13:59.890 --> 14:02.090
You being here is
in direct violation

14:02.092 --> 14:03.892
of American diplomatic
policy.

14:03.894 --> 14:06.995
Come on,
let's go call your parents.

14:10.666 --> 14:12.867
Steve, we respect the fact
that the State Department

14:12.869 --> 14:14.235
is facilitating this.

14:14.237 --> 14:15.537
Are you trying
to apologize?

14:15.539 --> 14:17.605
Because you're terrible at it.
I apologize.

14:17.607 --> 14:20.442
The Agency never intended
to compromise your authority.

14:20.444 --> 14:22.978
But that's exactly
what you're trying to do.

14:22.980 --> 14:25.146
Why else would you send
an operative here?

14:25.148 --> 14:27.582
- We didn't send her.
- To build national security.

14:27.584 --> 14:31.386
You're either deliberately
breaking a promise you made,

14:31.388 --> 14:33.254
or you've got a rogue agent
under your roof.

14:33.256 --> 14:36.825
We didn't make any promise.
You dictated terms.

14:36.827 --> 14:39.494
Perhaps while temperatures
are running high,

14:39.496 --> 14:40.962
we should avoid questioning
each other's motives.

14:40.964 --> 14:43.498
Everyone on this call wants
the State Department's deal

14:43.500 --> 14:45.100
with Yemen to succeed.

14:45.102 --> 14:47.469
Are you suddenly my partner
in this, Arthur?

14:47.471 --> 14:49.070
I'd like to think
we can work together, yes.

14:49.072 --> 14:51.339
The American people
finally get some relief

14:51.341 --> 14:52.707
from soaring energy costs,

14:52.709 --> 14:54.576
and an old man
gets to see a great doctor.

14:54.578 --> 14:56.444
Do you support
both those ideas?

14:56.446 --> 14:57.612
Of course I do.

14:57.614 --> 14:58.813
Then why are you
screwing it up?

14:58.815 --> 15:01.182
The CIA comes in,
everybody gets nervous.

15:01.184 --> 15:02.884
They start
to reconsider deals.

15:02.886 --> 15:04.853
I know you don't wanna be
responsible for that.

15:04.855 --> 15:06.621
I understand
your point of view, Steve.

15:06.623 --> 15:09.090
- You understand, or you agree?
- I agree.

15:09.092 --> 15:11.159
Then you'll send her home
right away.

15:11.161 --> 15:12.327
Right away.

15:12.329 --> 15:14.429
Good.

15:35.184 --> 15:37.385
Play the "what if" game
with me.

15:37.387 --> 15:38.720
Ooh, one of my favorites.

15:38.722 --> 15:40.422
Okay, a brilliant,
young operative

15:40.424 --> 15:42.724
flies to Minnesota
to turn a valuable asset--

15:42.726 --> 15:44.592
What if she's caught
by the State Department?

15:44.594 --> 15:46.828
She calls for advice.

15:46.830 --> 15:49.164
What if Joan and Arthur
cave to State and send her home?

15:49.166 --> 15:51.533
If we're talking
about the same operative,

15:51.535 --> 15:53.501
she uses whatever time
she has left

15:53.503 --> 15:55.103
to pursue her objective.

15:55.105 --> 15:57.105
What if she's been banned
from the building?

15:57.107 --> 16:01.109
Then she finds a way
to make him leave it.

16:03.012 --> 16:04.679
Auggie, you're brilliant.

16:04.681 --> 16:07.449
That's not a "what if"
statement.

16:07.451 --> 16:09.250
- You win.
- I usually do.

16:09.252 --> 16:12.787
Listen, I'm stepping into
a meeting for the next hour.

16:12.789 --> 16:14.289
Call me if you need anything,
all right?

16:14.291 --> 16:16.257
You're my top priority.
I'll be fine.

16:16.259 --> 16:18.193
No worries.

16:20.429 --> 16:22.931
Auggie.

16:26.368 --> 16:27.936
How's it going?

16:27.938 --> 16:29.804
Fantastic,
and I have a feeling

16:29.806 --> 16:31.206
it's about to get even better.

16:31.208 --> 16:32.373
It is?

16:32.375 --> 16:33.675
Today's your lucky day.

16:33.677 --> 16:35.210
We're gonna shake things up
a little bit.

16:35.212 --> 16:37.112
- How?
- A field trip.

16:37.114 --> 16:39.214
You could probably use
some fresh air.

16:39.216 --> 16:41.850
I don't live in this office,
Auggie, I just work here.

16:41.852 --> 16:43.651
Besides, we'll be here
for the hour.

16:43.653 --> 16:45.053
That's how this works.

16:45.055 --> 16:46.454
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:46.456 --> 16:48.056
The other week,
you presented yourself

16:48.058 --> 16:49.390
as an unconventional shrink:

16:49.392 --> 16:51.159
working with veterans,

16:51.161 --> 16:52.927
offering
to let me skip sessions.

16:52.929 --> 16:54.596
Is that just a cover?

16:54.598 --> 16:58.933
What did you have
in mind?

17:08.777 --> 17:13.615
- I'll take the cigarettes.
- Which ones?

17:13.617 --> 17:15.983
All of them.

17:20.156 --> 17:21.356
You're going
to show me

17:21.358 --> 17:23.324
how to get
across the street blindfolded?

17:23.326 --> 17:25.160
Orientation
and mobility training.

17:25.162 --> 17:26.994
When I did it,
I didn't have a choice.

17:26.997 --> 17:28.663
It'll help you
to understand me better.

17:28.665 --> 17:30.098
Auggie, I--

17:30.100 --> 17:31.499
And the more
that you protest,

17:31.501 --> 17:34.936
the less time you're gonna have
to get the hang of it.

17:34.938 --> 17:36.337
That's the spirit.

17:39.209 --> 17:41.276
You ready?
I'm ready.

17:41.278 --> 17:43.178
- Here you go.
- All right.

17:43.180 --> 17:44.646
How does this work?

17:44.648 --> 17:46.447
Okay, this cane's a couple
of inches too tall for you.

17:46.449 --> 17:47.782
So choke down a little bit.

17:47.784 --> 17:49.117
You're gonna hold it
waist high,

17:49.119 --> 17:50.985
about a foot in front
of your body.

17:50.987 --> 17:53.054
Think of it as an extension
of your index finger,

17:53.056 --> 17:55.323
but it should be
underneath the shaft.

17:55.325 --> 17:56.758
That way,
if you hit something,

17:56.760 --> 17:58.293
you're not gonna stab yourself
in the stomach.

17:58.295 --> 17:59.527
See?
Mmhmm.

17:59.529 --> 18:00.828
Very good.

18:00.830 --> 18:02.163
This little aluminum tube

18:02.165 --> 18:04.332
is about to become
your best friend.

18:11.407 --> 18:12.840
Cigarettes?

18:16.845 --> 18:21.382
You can bum
one of mine.

18:24.820 --> 18:26.854
Takes me four minutes
to smoke a cigarette.

18:26.856 --> 18:28.756
That's how much time you have.

18:28.758 --> 18:30.258
Mr. al-Muqri,
I'm surprised.

18:30.260 --> 18:32.227
I didn't take you for a man
who shuts down conversations.

18:32.229 --> 18:34.829
What sort of man
did you take me for?

18:34.831 --> 18:38.600
If given the right support...
a leader.

18:38.602 --> 18:40.235
That's what you tell
all of us, isn't it?

18:40.237 --> 18:42.070
Flatter us,
make us feel special.

18:42.072 --> 18:45.039
I've never said that
to anyone before.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.874
I came here to speak to you.

18:46.876 --> 18:49.110
Then speak.

18:53.916 --> 18:58.186
I'd like
to work with you.

18:58.188 --> 19:00.588
That's never going
to happen.

19:00.590 --> 19:02.123
Why not?

19:02.125 --> 19:03.891
Because the CIA has wreaked
havoc in my part of the world.

19:03.893 --> 19:06.828
You keep referring to me
as a mouthpiece for the Agency.

19:06.830 --> 19:08.496
I know you wouldn't like
to be thought of that way.

19:08.498 --> 19:09.731
You're your own person.

19:09.733 --> 19:10.999
A person
whom you have just met

19:11.001 --> 19:12.467
and yet claim to know so well.

19:12.469 --> 19:13.635
This is why we are enemies.

19:13.637 --> 19:14.836
Because you make assumptions
about us,

19:14.838 --> 19:16.137
and you act
as if they are true.

19:16.139 --> 19:17.438
You don't really believe
we're enemies.

19:17.440 --> 19:18.773
I believe your country
is only interested in mine

19:18.775 --> 19:20.074
because we have oil.

19:20.076 --> 19:22.577
You're right.

19:22.579 --> 19:24.412
If that's your pitch,
it's not a very good one.

19:24.414 --> 19:25.880
I'm being honest.

19:25.882 --> 19:27.382
We're interested in you
because of oil,

19:27.384 --> 19:29.550
and you're interested in us
because of our technology,

19:29.552 --> 19:32.253
our universities,
and sometimes our health care.

19:32.255 --> 19:34.889
As you can see,
we can be very giving.

19:34.891 --> 19:38.393
The empty hand, reaching for
help in the guise of affection.

19:41.697 --> 19:43.898
Reminds me of the prose
you wrote in that article.

19:43.900 --> 19:46.634
I didn't write
that article.

19:46.636 --> 19:48.803
You've fallen in love
with a ghost.

19:50.606 --> 19:52.607
Sayid, I don't have time
to play these games,

19:52.609 --> 19:54.142
and neither do you.

19:54.144 --> 19:56.110
You can't be happy with your
country's place in the world

19:56.112 --> 19:57.512
or your position in it.

19:57.514 --> 19:58.780
Work with me.

19:58.782 --> 20:01.049
- You mean spy for you.
- I mean work with me.

20:01.051 --> 20:03.384
We can share information
and ideas.

20:03.386 --> 20:05.186
We can build a bridge
between our nations

20:05.188 --> 20:06.554
that no one else
is willing to build.

20:06.556 --> 20:09.090
I am not a builder
of bridges.

20:09.092 --> 20:10.491
I serve at the pleasure
of the Prime Minister,

20:10.493 --> 20:12.327
and I accept the position
he has given me.

20:12.329 --> 20:16.264
But you're here now.

20:16.266 --> 20:19.734
You had cigarettes.

20:19.736 --> 20:22.904
The only cigarettes
in Minnesota?

20:22.906 --> 20:25.073
Maybe.

20:25.075 --> 20:27.408
Or maybe
you just like talking to me.

20:27.410 --> 20:29.110
Come on.

20:29.112 --> 20:31.012
What are you doing?

20:31.014 --> 20:33.114
I don't think we've been seen,
but we have to go now.

20:33.116 --> 20:35.149
What are you talking about?

20:35.151 --> 20:36.984
That car over there
has State Department plates.

20:36.986 --> 20:38.219
Can you run?

20:38.221 --> 20:39.987
I'm not running
anywhere with you.

20:39.989 --> 20:41.956
We don't have time
to negotiate this.

20:41.958 --> 20:43.825
You're unsupervised
and off the hospital campus,

20:43.827 --> 20:46.427
which is a violation,
and puts us both at risk.

20:46.429 --> 20:48.162
We have to go now.

20:49.598 --> 20:51.666
Which way?

21:49.295 --> 21:50.429
We should go.

21:50.431 --> 21:52.497
Out the front.
Wait, wait.

22:34.941 --> 22:38.610
Okay, we're at the corner.
I've got you all lined up.

22:38.612 --> 22:41.613
There is a dip in the concrete
called a cutout.

22:41.615 --> 22:44.216
And I want you step out
into that cutout.

22:45.419 --> 22:47.018
Uh, wait, wait, wait! Stop!
Watch it!

22:47.020 --> 22:48.520
I said onto the cutout,
not into the street.

22:48.522 --> 22:50.689
- Sorry, I thought that--
- No, it's okay.

22:50.691 --> 22:52.858
Just take a breath.

22:52.860 --> 22:54.726
Very good.

22:54.728 --> 22:56.061
Now, here are
the ground rules.

22:56.063 --> 22:58.196
You are gonna have to lean
into your other senses.

22:58.198 --> 23:00.365
Listening is everything.

23:00.367 --> 23:02.968
I want you to feel the ground
with your feet.

23:02.970 --> 23:06.004
It'll tell you everything
that you need to know.

23:06.006 --> 23:08.140
Now take a breath.

23:08.142 --> 23:10.642
What do you smell?
Exhaust.

23:10.644 --> 23:12.444
Something
even less pleasant.

23:12.446 --> 23:14.212
Hmm, a dog.

23:14.214 --> 23:15.781
Who's left a calling card,
so watch your step.

23:17.117 --> 23:19.184
Now, you're gonna
sweep the cane

23:19.186 --> 23:20.886
back and forth
in front of you

23:20.888 --> 23:23.622
like you're clearing the way
for each step.

23:23.624 --> 23:28.059
When we start, you're gonna
keep sweeping and breathing.

23:28.061 --> 23:31.329
That's right.

23:33.266 --> 23:34.766
Okay,
we've got parallel traffic.

23:34.768 --> 23:36.701
You hear that?
Uhhuh. I hear it.

23:36.703 --> 23:38.069
Then we're safe.
Let's go.

23:38.071 --> 23:40.438
Okay.

23:40.440 --> 23:42.240
That's it!

23:42.242 --> 23:44.176
Nice and steady.

23:45.512 --> 23:48.613
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Take your blindfold off.

23:48.615 --> 23:51.349
- That's crazy.
- Yeah, it happens.

23:51.351 --> 23:53.084
Most people veer toward
their dominant leg.

23:53.086 --> 23:55.153
Now come line yourself back up,
put your blindfold on,

23:55.155 --> 23:58.924
and keep going.

23:58.926 --> 24:00.959
Okay.

24:04.363 --> 24:06.431
That's it.
Keep going.

24:06.433 --> 24:09.234
Keep going.

24:10.803 --> 24:15.807
All right, you did it.
I did it!

24:15.809 --> 24:19.144
Oh, my God,
that was amazing!

24:20.746 --> 24:24.616
Let's do it again.
That a girl.

24:27.453 --> 24:29.087
You sure we lost them?

24:29.089 --> 24:31.423
Let's sit near the back door
just in case.

24:31.425 --> 24:34.793
How are you feeling
about those cigarettes now?

24:34.795 --> 24:38.263
Oh, not winded.
It's just adrenaline.

24:38.265 --> 24:39.598
Yeah,
keep telling yourself that.

24:39.600 --> 24:40.899
- Counter?
- Booth.

24:40.901 --> 24:44.035
The one at the back, please.
Mmhmm.

24:51.410 --> 24:54.346
Does this, uh, sort of thing
happen to you a lot?

24:54.348 --> 24:55.847
It happens.

24:55.849 --> 24:58.683
Mostly my job
consists of talking to people.

25:01.888 --> 25:05.323
I'm hungry.
Let's order something.

25:05.325 --> 25:07.592
Western food doesn't
really interest me.

25:07.594 --> 25:11.162
Everything's on a bun.

25:11.164 --> 25:13.865
Can I have a turkey sandwich
on whole wheat,

25:13.867 --> 25:16.568
and can you bring
the check with it?

25:16.570 --> 25:19.938
I'll have a hamburger,
toasted bun, please.

25:21.507 --> 25:24.743
What? It's like going to Japan
and not ordering Sushi.

25:39.692 --> 25:42.460
I barely recognized you
in that meeting today.

25:42.462 --> 25:43.795
I read you in
on the Yemen deal,

25:43.797 --> 25:45.297
I told you
it wasn't actionable,

25:45.299 --> 25:47.999
and you used it to make a play.
I showed initiative.

25:48.001 --> 25:49.301
How could you
send Annie there?

25:49.303 --> 25:50.869
Because she showed me
initiative.

25:50.871 --> 25:52.370
And why not send her there?

25:52.372 --> 25:53.805
Because State Department's
nervous?

25:53.807 --> 25:55.073
No, because
the State Department

25:55.075 --> 25:57.342
is trying to navigate
very fragile terrain,

25:57.344 --> 25:58.743
and they're doing it well.

25:58.745 --> 26:00.578
Since when do you compliment
the State Department?

26:00.580 --> 26:02.247
You detest Steve Barr
and all his cronies.

26:02.249 --> 26:03.415
You always have.

26:03.417 --> 26:05.784
You put me
in an impossible position.

26:08.154 --> 26:12.123
Arthur, I probably should've
talked to you first.

26:12.125 --> 26:13.425
Yes.

26:13.427 --> 26:15.427
But I took a chance.

26:15.429 --> 26:17.929
Are you angry because
I didn't defend your operation

26:17.931 --> 26:19.397
or because
I didn't defend you?

26:19.399 --> 26:21.066
You know, in this case,
they're the same thing.

26:21.068 --> 26:23.902
You realize
you're almost out the door?

26:23.904 --> 26:25.303
No.

26:25.305 --> 26:27.505
Yes. The promise
of the Chinese ambassador post

26:27.507 --> 26:29.708
is pulling you away
like you no longer work here,

26:29.710 --> 26:31.376
like you've already gotten
the job.

26:31.378 --> 26:33.311
The choice I made today
was the right call,

26:33.313 --> 26:34.913
given the facts
that I had.

26:37.917 --> 26:41.086
You know what, Arthur?

26:41.088 --> 26:44.856
You're gonna make
a great politician.

26:51.998 --> 26:54.366
Mmm.

26:54.368 --> 26:57.502
It's pretty good.

26:57.504 --> 27:00.138
My, um--

27:00.140 --> 27:03.174
my father was a dear friend
to Prime Minister Halabi,

27:03.176 --> 27:06.244
and when my parents died,
he took me in.

27:06.246 --> 27:08.413
I was 12 years old.

27:08.415 --> 27:11.216
I remember, not long
after I moved into the palace,

27:11.218 --> 27:14.386
a small bird hit the bedroom
window and injured its wing.

27:14.388 --> 27:17.055
The Prime Minister,
he had falcons for some time,

27:17.057 --> 27:18.590
so he knew something
about birds.

27:18.592 --> 27:21.359
So he taught me
how to repair the wing

27:21.361 --> 27:23.928
and nurse the bird back
to health.

27:23.930 --> 27:26.097
And I remember asking him
every day

27:26.099 --> 27:27.766
if we can let the bird go,

27:27.768 --> 27:29.968
and he said something to me
I'll never forget.

27:29.970 --> 27:34.139
He said it would be cruel
to let the bird go too soon,

27:34.141 --> 27:36.374
that it would surely die
on its own,

27:36.376 --> 27:40.045
being weak and unable to fly

27:40.047 --> 27:44.249
and that just because I want
the bird to be free

27:44.251 --> 27:45.817
doesn't mean
that it's ready.

27:48.721 --> 27:50.188
You think
the Yemeni people

27:50.190 --> 27:52.057
are little birds
with broken wings?

27:52.059 --> 27:56.594
I think a nation chooses
when and how to change.

27:56.596 --> 27:57.996
It's up to their leaders
to listen.

27:57.998 --> 28:00.565
That's a progressive thought.

28:00.567 --> 28:02.300
Does your mentor
share your views?

28:02.302 --> 28:03.401
He's not just my mentor.

28:03.403 --> 28:05.603
He's my family.

28:05.605 --> 28:07.138
He saved my life.

28:07.140 --> 28:10.408
So you share
all his views.

28:10.410 --> 28:11.743
You disagree
with your mentor?

28:11.745 --> 28:14.612
I've had a few mentors,

28:14.614 --> 28:16.514
and I disagree with them
every day.

28:16.516 --> 28:19.084
How do you respect a man
you disagree with?

28:19.086 --> 28:22.353
Both my mentors
are women.

28:22.355 --> 28:25.490
The CIA is indeed
a complicated place.

28:26.792 --> 28:29.894
I respect them.

28:29.896 --> 28:33.565
They succeeded
where few women have.

28:33.567 --> 28:36.768
And even when we disagree,
I know they'd look out for me.

28:36.770 --> 28:38.736
They believe in you.

28:40.039 --> 28:42.674
Now imagine how it would feel
to lose that.

28:42.676 --> 28:45.677
It'd feel horrible.

28:49.014 --> 28:52.283
So is this, uh,
how the CIA works?

28:52.285 --> 28:54.385
You talk to people like they are
on Oprah's couch?

28:56.655 --> 28:59.390
I asked you to reveal
something about yourself.

28:59.392 --> 29:02.961
I thought it only fair
I do the same.

29:22.715 --> 29:25.884
They won't stay out long.
Let's circle back.

29:25.886 --> 29:28.019
We're walking, huh?

29:28.021 --> 29:32.724
Wish I would've worn
comfortable shoes.

29:32.726 --> 29:36.127
I'm, uh, sorry this didn't
work out the way you wanted.

29:36.129 --> 29:39.164
Oh, it's not about me.

29:39.166 --> 29:41.766
What do you want
to happen?

29:41.768 --> 29:43.868
I want A'zam
to make a full recovery.

29:43.870 --> 29:46.171
That's all.

29:46.173 --> 29:49.841
Yeah.
You're right.

29:49.843 --> 29:51.176
I'm right?

29:51.178 --> 29:53.511
You couldn't have written
that article.

29:53.513 --> 29:55.780
Whoever wrote it
has courage and vision.

29:55.782 --> 29:59.517
That's not you.
You have fear and caution.

29:59.519 --> 30:02.687
So now you've taken
to insulting me.

30:02.689 --> 30:04.722
You really think
that's going to work?

30:04.724 --> 30:06.491
I don't know.

30:06.493 --> 30:08.426
How do you convince someone
in ten minutes

30:08.428 --> 30:11.496
that you believe in them more
than they believe in themselves?

30:11.498 --> 30:14.332
Be grateful for what A'zam
has given you,

30:14.334 --> 30:18.169
but look for ways to realize
your own potential.

30:18.171 --> 30:21.406
I am one of those ways--
we are, right now.

30:23.809 --> 30:26.911
Annie, I can't.

30:31.750 --> 30:33.284
Where are you going?

30:33.286 --> 30:34.986
I'm done.

30:34.988 --> 30:40.291
Annie, you don't know
what you're asking of me.

30:40.293 --> 30:41.492
I do.

30:41.494 --> 30:43.494
Even if I agreed to work
with the CIA,

30:43.496 --> 30:44.829
I wouldn't be talking
to you.

30:44.831 --> 30:46.464
You would disappear.
I wouldn't.

30:46.466 --> 30:48.233
And what happens
if I get caught?

30:48.235 --> 30:49.934
If someone in Yemen
discovers our work?

30:49.936 --> 30:51.803
We have emergency protocol
for asset protection.

30:51.805 --> 30:53.037
I could teach that to you.

30:53.039 --> 30:54.339
Does that apply to my sister
and her family?

30:54.341 --> 30:55.840
Yes.

30:55.842 --> 31:00.044
You can guarantee that now, or
you'll have to ask your mentor?

31:00.046 --> 31:03.681
I have to ask her.

31:03.683 --> 31:06.651
But here's a number
where you can reach me.

31:06.653 --> 31:09.988
Memorize it,
and destroy the card.

31:32.444 --> 31:35.146
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

31:35.148 --> 31:36.481
Annie,
you missed your plane.

31:36.483 --> 31:37.882
We agreed
that if you got caught,

31:37.884 --> 31:39.617
you would get on a plane
and come back home.

31:39.619 --> 31:42.520
Joan, I got him
to talk to me.

31:42.522 --> 31:43.788
You did what?

31:43.790 --> 31:45.189
He has some requests
regarding asylum

31:45.191 --> 31:46.791
for him and his sister,
but it's all pretty standard.

31:46.793 --> 31:48.793
Stop. There's something
we need to talk about.

31:48.795 --> 31:50.461
The Prime Minister
had another heart attack.

31:50.463 --> 31:52.697
He's in critical condition.

31:52.699 --> 31:55.166
I have to talk to Sayid.
I don't wanna lose him, Joan.

31:55.168 --> 31:56.834
You have to come home.

31:56.836 --> 31:59.370
If the Prime Minister of Yemen
dies on our soil,

31:59.372 --> 32:00.838
the last thing
anyone wants

32:00.840 --> 32:02.940
is for a CIA operative
to be found on the scene.

32:02.942 --> 32:04.976
Can we grant him asylum
or not?

32:04.978 --> 32:06.311
Annie,
you're not listening to me.

32:06.313 --> 32:09.213
We cannot grant asylum.
State will never allow it.

32:09.215 --> 32:10.415
Not after today.

32:10.417 --> 32:11.749
No, we have to make
this happen.

32:11.751 --> 32:13.184
The State Department
is trying to avoid

32:13.186 --> 32:14.819
an international incident.

32:14.821 --> 32:16.254
They're looking for you.

32:16.256 --> 32:17.588
Annie, you need
to get on a plane.

32:17.590 --> 32:19.857
No, not before I talk to him.
Sorry, Joan.

32:22.877 --> 32:23.840
Ow!

32:24.267 --> 32:25.668
Ooh, you okay?

32:25.670 --> 32:26.836
Yeah.

32:26.838 --> 32:28.938
Fire hydrant
came out of nowhere.

32:28.940 --> 32:30.339
Yeah, they do that.

32:30.341 --> 32:31.907
Oh, even to you?

32:31.909 --> 32:35.778
Oh, I bump into stuff
about 14 times a day.

32:35.780 --> 32:38.247
And I've been known to walk
into the ladies' bathroom.

32:38.249 --> 32:41.517
Sometimes on purpose.

32:41.519 --> 32:42.852
The truth is being blind
is hard.

32:42.854 --> 32:44.320
It's difficult every day.

32:44.322 --> 32:46.889
Do you ever wanna
stay home?

32:46.891 --> 32:49.491
Yeah, sure,
but I don't.

32:49.493 --> 32:51.794
So when you're not up to it,
what do you do?

32:53.530 --> 32:55.631
I keep going
'cause I have to.

33:00.103 --> 33:03.806
About five years ago
after my injury,

33:03.808 --> 33:07.176
all I wanted to do was get
back to my unit,

33:07.178 --> 33:08.911
keep serving my country,

33:08.913 --> 33:10.346
but I didn't see

33:10.348 --> 33:12.281
how I could do either
of those things

33:12.283 --> 33:15.451
when I couldn't even
cross the street.

33:15.453 --> 33:18.220
I found myself on a corner,
just like that one--

33:18.222 --> 33:23.259
frozen, turned around...

33:23.261 --> 33:25.828
lost.

33:25.830 --> 33:28.497
So I threw my cane away,

33:28.499 --> 33:30.733
I heard it hit the ground,

33:30.735 --> 33:32.701
and just walked into traffic

33:32.703 --> 33:34.937
counting on somebody else
to finish the job

33:34.939 --> 33:36.839
the explosion didn't.

33:38.675 --> 33:42.278
Some drivers
have good reflexes.

33:42.280 --> 33:45.781
You're a survivor.
What does that feel like?

33:45.783 --> 33:48.884
I'm lucky.

33:48.886 --> 33:51.754
I'm a lucky guy.

33:57.027 --> 33:59.995
Oh, hey, look at that.
Our time's almost up.

33:59.997 --> 34:02.264
You better get back
for your next victim.

34:02.266 --> 34:03.532
Because--

34:03.534 --> 34:05.167
I opened up,
I shared.

34:05.169 --> 34:07.102
Come on, Doc,
congratulations.

34:07.104 --> 34:08.504
You got what you wanted
after all.

34:08.505 --> 34:10.940
I got my gold star, right?
It was nice knowing you.

34:10.942 --> 34:12.341
No, we're not done yet.

34:12.342 --> 34:14.275
How do you figure?

34:14.277 --> 34:15.643
We haven't talked about

34:15.646 --> 34:17.612
what inspired this field trip
in the first place.

34:17.614 --> 34:20.248
You walked into my office
with your own blueprint

34:20.251 --> 34:21.784
for what therapy should be.

34:21.786 --> 34:24.112
Yeah,
it was pretty damn good.

34:25.101 --> 34:28.338
Are you always trying
to manage people in situations?

36:12.495 --> 36:13.791
Sayid!
What are you doing?

36:13.792 --> 36:14.824
This is my last chance.

36:14.826 --> 36:16.759
I really need you
to listen to me.

36:16.761 --> 36:17.961
Listen to me, please.

36:17.963 --> 36:19.128
A'zam had another
heart attack.

36:19.130 --> 36:20.463
- I know.
- I'm going to see him.

36:20.465 --> 36:22.065
Now let me out of here.

36:22.067 --> 36:24.167
We both fear
that we may lose our mentors

36:24.169 --> 36:26.169
or that our mentors
may lose faith in us.

36:26.171 --> 36:29.005
But this is your choice.
Your wings have healed.

36:29.007 --> 36:30.673
Annie, please.
Let me out of here.

36:30.675 --> 36:31.941
I fear you'll see

36:31.943 --> 36:33.376
the Prime Minister's
second heart attack

36:33.378 --> 36:35.745
as some kind of sign that
he needs you now more than ever,

36:35.747 --> 36:38.648
but your loyalty
cannot save him.

36:38.650 --> 36:41.784
There is something bigger
that we can save now.

36:41.786 --> 36:43.453
Save what, Annie?

36:43.455 --> 36:45.121
Yemen? America?
The world?

36:45.123 --> 36:47.390
Not today.
Not all at once.

36:47.392 --> 36:49.259
But a piece of it.

36:50.861 --> 36:53.997
Did you speak to your boss
about my request?

36:53.999 --> 36:59.002
She said
it's not possible.

36:59.004 --> 37:02.138
I'm sorry.

37:02.140 --> 37:03.806
And do you disagree
with your mentor on this?

37:03.808 --> 37:05.975
I do, absolutely.

37:05.977 --> 37:07.110
But not enough
to do anything about it.

37:07.112 --> 37:09.512
What can I do?

37:09.514 --> 37:11.648
So now you understand
my position.

37:11.650 --> 37:14.584
Perhaps we do have
a lot in common.

37:14.586 --> 37:18.621
"Only a fool confuses fate
with destiny.

37:18.623 --> 37:21.291
"Fate is what happens
to us.

37:21.293 --> 37:25.461
Destiny is what we make
in spite of our fate."

37:27.698 --> 37:30.600
I wrote that article
such a long time ago.

37:32.436 --> 37:34.671
How did you know
it was me?

37:34.673 --> 37:38.408
Because it
was courageous.

37:38.410 --> 37:40.944
You weren't waiting
for someone else

37:40.946 --> 37:45.014
to tell you you were ready,
you already knew.

38:03.567 --> 38:05.301
Where is A'zam?

38:07.237 --> 38:10.840
Take her.

38:17.519 --> 38:21.003
Prime Minister A'zam Halabi
of Yemen, passed away last night

38:21.005 --> 38:24.341
at the Mayo Clinic
in Rochester, Minnesota.

38:24.343 --> 38:26.877
The U.S. State Department
had made arrangements

38:26.879 --> 38:28.979
for Halabi to receive
medical treatment there

38:28.981 --> 38:32.883
after suffering his first
of two myocardial infarctions.

38:32.885 --> 38:34.951
The late Prime Minister's aides
and personnel

38:34.953 --> 38:37.220
have returned to Yemen, where
the state of the government

38:37.222 --> 38:38.755
remains in flux.

38:38.757 --> 38:42.359
We turn now
to our correspondent in Sana'a.

38:42.361 --> 38:45.162
So this is what a deal
with State looks like.

38:45.164 --> 38:46.797
You gonna say
"I told you so"?

38:46.799 --> 38:49.132
I don't believe in
"I told you so."

38:49.134 --> 38:51.635
The thing went sideways.
That is not your fault.

38:51.637 --> 38:53.970
If I had two more minutes,
Sayid would've said yes.

38:53.972 --> 38:56.706
You know the great truth
about turning an asset.

38:56.708 --> 38:59.543
You gotta cast a lot of lines
before you catch a fish.

38:59.545 --> 39:02.546
This is the toughest thing
that we do.

39:02.548 --> 39:04.448
I thought I had him.

39:04.450 --> 39:07.784
The strangest thing--spending
so long reading about someone,

39:07.786 --> 39:11.621
their whole life
unfolds in front of you.

39:11.623 --> 39:13.290
I felt like I could see
his potential.

39:13.292 --> 39:16.026
- You believed in him.
- Yeah.

39:16.028 --> 39:19.963
How angry is she?

39:21.265 --> 39:24.935
Annie.
Will you step inside, please?

39:36.047 --> 39:39.382
Close the door.

39:39.384 --> 39:42.686
Have a seat.

39:42.688 --> 39:45.222
Do you have questions
about why

39:45.224 --> 39:46.923
I couldn't grant
Sayid's request?

39:46.925 --> 39:48.592
They don't matter now.

39:48.594 --> 39:51.394
They matter to me.

39:51.396 --> 39:56.800
Annie, this job,
this life is wonderful.

39:56.802 --> 39:58.635
To me it is.

39:58.637 --> 40:01.037
But it can also be
frustrating.

40:01.039 --> 40:05.642
Never more so than when
uncertainties drive decisions.

40:05.644 --> 40:07.277
Well,
the future's uncertain.

40:07.279 --> 40:10.914
Yeah, it is.

40:10.916 --> 40:12.149
Look, I know
this was painful.

40:12.151 --> 40:14.918
And it's okay to be angry
with the CIA.

40:14.920 --> 40:17.487
It's even okay
to be angry with me.

40:18.923 --> 40:24.394
Joan, I've thought
about this a lot...

40:26.264 --> 40:28.899
and I've requested
a department transfer.

40:31.836 --> 40:33.637
Do you want to go back
to work for Lena?

40:33.639 --> 40:36.673
I don't know.
I left it blank on the form.

40:36.675 --> 40:40.343
Well, I'm sorry
to hear that.

40:40.345 --> 40:41.845
I appreciate everything
you've done for me.

40:41.847 --> 40:45.348
I just think
it's time to move on.

41:06.804 --> 41:10.140
Annie, there's a Yemeni man
on the asset line.

41:10.142 --> 41:11.675
He says
he'll only speak with you.

41:11.677 --> 41:14.044
What?

41:14.046 --> 41:15.812
Does Joan know?
Of course.

41:15.814 --> 41:16.980
We spoke this morning.

41:16.982 --> 41:18.148
She made it clear
that if he called,

41:18.150 --> 41:19.649
he was to be your asset.

41:19.651 --> 41:21.151
Congratulations.

41:25.289 --> 41:27.524
Annie.

41:27.526 --> 41:28.959
You gonna take the call?

41:28.961 --> 41:30.627
Yeah.

41:38.236 --> 41:39.402
Hello?
