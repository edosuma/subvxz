00:24.000 --> 00:26.200
I'm talkin'about friendship.

00:26.100 --> 00:28.700
I'm talkin'about character.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.200
I'm talkin'about--
Hell, Leo, I ain't embarrassed
to use the word.

00:33.400 --> 00:36.400
I'm talkin' about ethics.

00:36.700 --> 00:38.700
You know I'm a sportin' man.

00:38.800 --> 00:41.200
I like to lay the occasional bet.

00:41.300 --> 00:43.800
But I ain't that sportin'.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.800
When I fix a fight--
Say I pay a three to one favorite...

00:46.900 --> 00:48.900
to throw a goddamned fight.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
I figure I got the right
to expect that fight
to go off at three to one.

00:53.300 --> 00:56.800
But every time I lay in bed
with this son of a bitch
Bernie Bernbaum,

00:57.000 --> 01:00.200
before I know it,
the odds is even up.

01:00.400 --> 01:02.900
Or worse, I'm bettin'
on the short money.

01:03.100 --> 01:05.200
The sheeny knows
I like sure things.

01:05.400 --> 01:08.700
He's sellin' the information
I fixed the fight.

01:08.900 --> 01:11.200
Out of town money
comes pouring in.

01:11.300 --> 01:13.500
The odds go straight to hell.

01:13.700 --> 01:16.900
I don't know who
he's sellin' to-- maybe
the Los Angeles combine.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.900
I don't know. The point is,

01:19.100 --> 01:23.100
Bernie ain't satisfied
with the honest dollar
he can make off the vig.

01:23.300 --> 01:26.400
He ain't satisfied with
the business I do on his book.

01:26.600 --> 01:29.400
He is sellin' tips on how I bet.

01:29.600 --> 01:32.700
And that means part
of the payoff that should
be riding on my hip...

01:32.900 --> 01:34.900
is riding on someone else's.

01:35.100 --> 01:37.500
So, back we go
to these questions--

01:37.700 --> 01:41.400
friendship, character,

01:41.700 --> 01:43.900
ethics.

01:47.100 --> 01:49.100
So, it's clear what I'm saying?

01:50.600 --> 01:53.300
As mud.

01:56.100 --> 02:01.600
It's gettin' so a businessman
can't expect no return
from a fixed fight.

02:01.900 --> 02:05.200
Now, if you can't trust a fix,
what can you trust?

02:05.400 --> 02:08.600
For a good return,you gotta
go bettin'on chance,

02:08.900 --> 02:11.000
and then you're
back with anarchy.

02:11.200 --> 02:13.000
Right back in the jungle.

02:13.200 --> 02:18.100
That's why ethics is important--
what separates us
from the animals,

02:18.300 --> 02:20.700
the beasts of burden,
the beasts of prey.

02:20.900 --> 02:22.800
Ethics.

02:22.900 --> 02:26.900
Whereas, uh, Bernie Bernbaum
is a horse of a different color,

02:27.100 --> 02:30.700
ethics-wise, as in
he ain't got any.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.900
- You sure it's Bernie
selling you out?
- It ain't elves.

02:35.200 --> 02:38.900
- No one else knows about the fix?
- No one that ain't got ethics.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.900
What about the fighters
you pay to tank out?

02:42.200 --> 02:46.000
We only pick fighters
we know we can put
the fear of God in.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.400
Any other bookies know?
You play anyone else's book?

02:48.500 --> 02:51.600
I-I lay an occasional bet
with Mink Larouie.

02:51.900 --> 02:54.300
- But it ain't Mink.
I'll vouch for that.
-How do you know?

02:54.500 --> 02:57.600
It ain't Mink.
Mink is Eddie Dane's boy.

02:57.800 --> 03:01.500
Of course the Dane
always knows about the fix.

03:01.700 --> 03:03.800
And what the hell
is that supposed to mean?

03:04.000 --> 03:07.300
Let it drift. All it means is
a lot of people know.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.800
I guess you ain't
been listenin'.

03:09.900 --> 03:12.000
Sure, other people know.

03:12.200 --> 03:14.800
That's why we gotta go
to this question of character...

03:15.000 --> 03:18.500
to determine just who, exactly,
is chiselin' in on my fix.

03:18.800 --> 03:22.400
And that's how we know
that it's Bernie Bernbaum,
the shmatte kid--

03:22.600 --> 03:25.500
'cause ethically,
he's kinda shaky.

03:26.900 --> 03:30.800
- So you want to kill him.
- For starters.

03:45.500 --> 03:49.800
Sorry, Caspar.
Bernie pays for protection.

03:51.500 --> 03:54.500
Listen, Leo, I ain't
askin' you for permission.

03:54.700 --> 03:58.700
I'm tellin' you as a courtesy.
I need to do this thing,
so it's gonna get done.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.800
And I'm tellin' you, as
a courtesy, you'll have trouble.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.700
You came here to see if
I'd kick if you killed Bernie.
Well, there's your answer.

04:04.900 --> 04:08.500
I pay off to you every month
like a greengrocer

04:08.600 --> 04:10.500
a lot more than the shmatte,

04:10.700 --> 04:12.600
and I'm sick of gettin'
the high hat.

04:12.700 --> 04:15.600
You pay off for protection
just like everyone else.

04:15.800 --> 04:18.500
As far as I know, and
what I don't know in this town
ain't worth knowing,

04:18.700 --> 04:20.600
the cops haven't closed
any of your dives...

04:20.700 --> 04:23.100
and the D.A. hasn't touched
any of your rackets.

04:23.300 --> 04:25.700
You haven't bought any license
to kill bookies,

04:25.900 --> 04:27.800
and today I ain't sellin'any.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.800
So take your flunky and dangle.

04:30.900 --> 04:35.200
You think I'm some guinea
fresh off the boat,
and you can kick me.

04:35.400 --> 04:39.300
But I'm too big for that now.
I'm sick of takin'
the strap from you, Leo.

04:39.600 --> 04:41.900
I'm sick of marching
into this goddamn office...

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
to kiss your Irish ass,

04:44.100 --> 04:46.500
and I'm sick of the high hat!

05:03.300 --> 05:06.400
You's fancy pants, all of youse.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.800
Johnny?

05:11.000 --> 05:14.200
You're exactly as big
as I let you be and no bigger,

05:14.300 --> 05:16.500
and don't forget it, ever.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.100
That's right, Leo.

05:21.200 --> 05:23.200
You're the big shot
around here,

05:23.400 --> 05:26.900
and I'm just some schnook
likes to get slapped around.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.400
Twist a pig's ear,
watch him squeal.

05:46.100 --> 05:49.500
- Bad play, Leo.
- Who got up the wrong side, huh?

05:49.800 --> 05:52.500
-Same side as always.
- That's what I mean.
Still owe money to--

05:52.600 --> 05:56.000
Who is your bookie, Lazarre?
I could put it right for you.

05:56.200 --> 05:59.100
- Thanks, Leo. I don't need it.
- In a pig's eye.

05:59.300 --> 06:01.200
You haven't played
a winner in six weeks.

06:01.300 --> 06:03.600
People will speak ill of me
if I let him break your legs.

06:03.800 --> 06:07.500
- People will say I had it coming.
-And they'll be right,
but that ain't the point.

06:07.700 --> 06:11.400
Call me a bighearted slob,
but I'm gonna square it
for you, yeah.

06:11.700 --> 06:15.000
I think I'll do that
this very same night.

06:15.100 --> 06:18.900
Lookin' at you mopin' around
takes away all my--

06:19.100 --> 06:21.600
What do you call it?
"Joy de veever"?

06:21.800 --> 06:24.800
-Joie de vivre.
- Well, if you're gonna
laugh at me, the hell with ya.

06:24.900 --> 06:27.400
The hell with you.

06:27.700 --> 06:30.000
I'll square myself with Lazarre,
if you don't mind.

06:30.200 --> 06:33.000
That's why God invented cards.

06:35.600 --> 06:38.300
- There is one thing
you can do for me.
- Name it.

06:38.500 --> 06:40.800
Think about what
protecting Bernie gets us.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.500
Think about what
offending Caspar loses us.

06:43.700 --> 06:45.900
Oh, come on, Tommy.
You know I don't like to think.

06:46.100 --> 06:48.100
Yeah.

06:48.300 --> 06:52.100
Well, think about
whether you should start.

08:36.700 --> 08:38.900
Wake up, Tommy.

08:39.100 --> 08:42.100
- I am awake.
- Your eyes are shut.

08:42.200 --> 08:44.400
Who you gonna believe?

08:55.000 --> 08:57.600
- How'd I do?
- What do you think?

08:57.700 --> 09:00.400
You are a millionaire.
You gonna remember your friends?

09:03.900 --> 09:07.500
- Where's me hat?
- You bet it, mug.

09:07.600 --> 09:11.000
Good thing the game broke up
before you bet your trousers.

09:12.400 --> 09:15.500
- Who made off with me hat?

09:15.800 --> 09:18.500
Verna. Verna and Mink.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.900
- Who?
- Mink and Verna.

09:28.800 --> 09:31.000
Is Thunderclap running tonight?

09:31.200 --> 09:34.300
Thunderclap?
Yeah.

09:34.600 --> 09:36.500
What's she leaving at?

09:36.600 --> 09:39.100
Three to one, more than likely.

09:39.400 --> 09:42.500
Lay off, Tom. You shouldn't go
deeper in the hole.

09:42.700 --> 09:45.100
Tell Lazarre...

09:45.300 --> 09:48.600
I want 500 on the nose.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.200
You would have it.

10:04.300 --> 10:06.900
I want me hat.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.700
Is that all you came for?

10:10.900 --> 10:13.200
Yeah. I want me hat.

10:13.300 --> 10:15.400
It's mine. I won it.

10:15.500 --> 10:18.100
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Drop dead.

10:26.700 --> 10:29.500
I need a drink.

10:29.700 --> 10:32.200
Why didn't you say so?

11:28.800 --> 11:31.700
Hello, Tommy.
Sorry about the hour.

11:31.900 --> 11:35.600
- I'll live. What's the rumpus?
-Can I come in?

11:38.300 --> 11:40.800
Sure.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.500
- Drink?
- I wouldn't mind.

11:59.500 --> 12:01.500
I tried callin' earlier.

12:01.700 --> 12:04.200
I got home late.

12:09.600 --> 12:14.800
- Well, uh, I'm sorry about the hour.
- Uh-huh.

12:27.300 --> 12:30.800
- Not bad.
- Better than the paint
we sell at the club.

12:30.900 --> 12:33.500
That it is. That it is.

12:37.200 --> 12:39.300
- You thought about
cutting Bernie loose?
- Can't do it, Tommy.

12:39.500 --> 12:42.300
Can't do it.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.900
That's sort of why I'm, uh--

12:47.600 --> 12:50.500
Tommy, I don't know where Verna is.

12:50.800 --> 12:54.000
- Uh-huh.
- I know what you're thinkin',
what else is new?

12:54.200 --> 12:57.000
But the situation now--
I'm worried.

12:57.200 --> 13:00.500
Verna can take care of herself,
maybe better than you can.

13:00.800 --> 13:04.200
- What does that mean?
- Want another one?

13:04.400 --> 13:06.200
No.

13:06.400 --> 13:08.400
What does that mean?

13:08.500 --> 13:10.800
How far she got
her hooks into you?

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
That's a hell of a question.

13:15.300 --> 13:17.400
It's a grift.

13:17.600 --> 13:21.100
If she didn't need you
to protect her brother
from Johnny Caspar,

13:21.300 --> 13:24.800
you think she'd still be going
on slow carriage rides with you
through the park?

13:25.100 --> 13:29.300
That's the deal, isn't it?
You keep Bernie under wraps
till Caspar cools down?

13:29.600 --> 13:33.300
Jesus, you're a prickly pear.
What's wrong with her wanting
her brother taken care of?

13:33.400 --> 13:35.300
Nothing. I don't blame her.

13:35.500 --> 13:37.700
She sees the angle,
which is you, she plays it.

13:37.900 --> 13:40.700
She's a grifter,
just like her brother.

13:40.900 --> 13:43.100
Probably had grifter parents
and grifter grandparents...

13:43.200 --> 13:46.200
and someday they're each
gonna spawn little grifter kids.

13:46.400 --> 13:49.500
Stop it, Tommy.
I don't like to hear my friends
run down, even by other friends.

13:49.700 --> 13:51.800
- Friendship's got
nothing to do with it.
- The hell you say.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.700
You'd do anything to help
your friends, like you'd do
anything to kick your enemies.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.300
- Wrong, Leo.
You do things for a reason.
- Okay, Tom.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.300
- Wrong, Leo.
You do things for a reason.
- Okay, Tom.

13:58.400 --> 14:01.400
You know all the angles,
Christ, better than anybody.

14:03.600 --> 14:06.700
But maybe you're wrong
about this. You don't know
what's in Verna's heart.

14:06.900 --> 14:09.600
Leo, if she's such an angel,

14:09.800 --> 14:11.900
why are you looking for her
at 4:00 in the morning?

14:16.500 --> 14:18.300
I put a tail on her this afternoon.

14:19.800 --> 14:24.200
- Uh-huh.
- I asked Rug Daniels
to follow her around,

14:24.500 --> 14:27.600
just, you know,
to keep her out of trouble.

14:27.800 --> 14:31.800
I was worried.
After that meeting with Caspar,
you can't be too careful.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.100
- So what did Rug say that has you
scurrying over here?
- That's just it.

14:35.400 --> 14:40.800
- Nothing. He's disappeared.
- So you lost your lady friend
and the tail you put on her?

14:41.100 --> 14:43.600
I guess it does sound
pretty sorry at that.

14:43.800 --> 14:47.100
Help me out, Tom.
I wouldn't know where
to start lookin'.

14:47.400 --> 14:49.800
You know Rug's crowd.
You know the people Verna runs with.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.500
It's just I'm worried now
with things the way they are
between me and Caspar.

14:53.600 --> 14:56.400
You shouldn't be confronting
Johnny Caspar. That's what
I've been trying to tell you.

14:56.500 --> 14:59.300
You can't trade
body blows with him.
He's gotten too strong.

14:59.500 --> 15:03.400
I reckon I can still trade body blows
with any man in this town.

15:07.600 --> 15:10.200
Except you, Tom.

15:10.400 --> 15:12.300
And Verna.

15:22.300 --> 15:24.800
Okay. Give me the needle.

15:26.800 --> 15:29.800
I am a sap.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.200
I deserve it.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.500
Thanks for the drink.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.200
Let me know
if you hear anything.

16:07.900 --> 16:11.300
- Who was that?
- Leo.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.600
He's lookin' for you.

16:13.800 --> 16:16.200
Did you tell him I was here?

16:16.300 --> 16:18.700
No.

16:21.300 --> 16:24.500
Did you put in a good word
for my brother?

16:24.800 --> 16:26.800
No.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.100
- You said you would.
- I said I'd think about it.

16:32.300 --> 16:34.400
What did you tell him?

16:37.500 --> 16:40.200
Did you see
Rug Daniels last night?

16:40.400 --> 16:42.700
No.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.800
What did you tell Leo?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.600
I told him you were a tramp
and he should dump you.

16:51.600 --> 16:54.400
You're a son of a bitch, Tom.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.700
- Hello, Tom.
What's the rumpus?
- Mink.

18:09.900 --> 18:11.900
- I see you got your hat back.
- Yeah, what of it?

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Not a thing. Look,
if it ain't my business,
I got not a thing to say.

18:14.200 --> 18:16.100
Listen, Bernie wants to see you.
It's important.

18:16.200 --> 18:18.100
Yeah, well, I'm right here.
I'm not made of glass.

18:18.300 --> 18:20.800
He's nervous walkin' around
in public. He's a right guy,
but he's very nervous.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.500
I mean, who wouldn't be?
In the spot he's in,
who wouldn't be?

18:23.600 --> 18:25.900
He asked me to ask you
to ask Leo to take care of him.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Leo listens to you.
Not that Leo wouldn't help
a shmatte anyway.

18:28.200 --> 18:30.400
A guy like Bernie?
A straight shooter like him?

18:30.600 --> 18:33.200
- I don't get it, Mink.
- What's to get? It's as plain
as the nose on your face.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.600
- I thought you were
Eddie Dane's sycophant.
- Yeah, Tom, that's right,

18:35.800 --> 18:37.700
but a guy can have more
than one friend, can't he?

18:37.800 --> 18:40.800
Not that I want the Dane to know
about it, but the shmatte,
he's a right guy, Tommy.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.500
He's got a mixed reputation,
but for a sheeny, he's got
a lot of good qualities.

18:43.700 --> 18:46.800
- What's goin' on
between you and Bernie?
- Nothin', Tom.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.900
We're just...
friends, you know, amigos.

18:49.100 --> 18:51.400
You're a fickle boy, Mink.

18:51.500 --> 18:55.600
If Eddie Dane finds out
that you got another "amigo"--

18:55.900 --> 18:59.400
- Well, I don't peg him
for the understanding type.
- Find out?

18:59.700 --> 19:02.200
How's he gonna find out?
Damn it, you and me
ain't even been talkin'!

19:02.400 --> 19:04.800
Jesus, Tom! Damn it!Jesus!

19:07.200 --> 19:09.600
Hello, Tommy.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.800
- You know O'Doole and the mayor?
-I oughta.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.600
Voted for him six times last May.

19:15.700 --> 19:17.700
And that ain't the record, either.

19:19.900 --> 19:23.800
Oh, Verna turned up.
She's downstairs.

19:24.100 --> 19:27.300
- She say where she'd been?
- No. I didn't want to press her.

19:27.500 --> 19:31.700
- You hear about Rug?
- Yeah. R.I.P.

19:31.900 --> 19:34.800
They took his hair, Tommy.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.600
Jesus, that's strange.
Why would they do that?

19:37.700 --> 19:42.100
- Maybe it was injuns.
- "Eye-ties," more like it.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.300
Giovanni Gasparo.

19:46.500 --> 19:49.200
So you figure Caspar bumped Rug.

19:49.400 --> 19:51.900
- Well, it's pretty obvious, ain't it?
- Yeah?

19:52.100 --> 19:56.900
- So what's the plan?
- Well, we'll jump on the guinea
hard with both feet.

19:57.100 --> 20:00.500
- Give him the lowdown, Dale.
- Yes. Well, um,

20:00.800 --> 20:03.400
Leo here just reminded us
that Mr. Caspar operates...

20:03.500 --> 20:05.500
several clubs in our city,

20:05.700 --> 20:09.500
wherein the patrons
imbibe of rum and play
at games of chance.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.800
And we're supposed to
stop the party.

20:11.900 --> 20:14.800
- They don't look
to happy about it, Leo.
- Oh, no, it ain't that, Tom.

20:15.100 --> 20:18.100
-Jesus, Tom, we do as we're told.
- Maybe they're right
not to like it.

20:18.200 --> 20:21.200
Stirring up this hornet's nest
won't be good for anyone,
and it'll mean killing.

20:21.400 --> 20:24.400
I'm not thrilled
about it either, but I can't
just lay down to Caspar.

20:24.600 --> 20:27.100
You could do worse.
You might not like it, but
giving up Bernie Bernbaum...

20:27.300 --> 20:29.200
is a pretty small price
to pay for peace.

20:29.300 --> 20:32.300
Business is business,
and a war is going to hurt everybody.

20:32.500 --> 20:34.700
Bernie plays with fire,
he's got to deal
with the consequences.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.800
even if that means
he gets bumped off.

20:36.900 --> 20:40.800
SweetJesus, Tom, that ain't
even the point anymore.
Caspar pooped Rug.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.700
The day I back down
from a fight, Caspar's
welcome to the rackets,

20:43.900 --> 20:45.900
this town and my place
at the table.

20:46.100 --> 20:48.100
- I didn't start this thing, but--
- You did start it.

20:48.200 --> 20:51.500
- You and Verna.
- We can dangle, Leo,
if you'd prefer.

20:51.800 --> 20:53.700
Sit down, Dale!
We're all friends here.

20:53.900 --> 20:57.200
And Caspar hasn't
broken the rules, Bernie has,
and you, too, by helping him.

20:57.400 --> 20:59.500
And if that isn't enough,
consider that if you
make this a war,

20:59.600 --> 21:01.700
you have more to lose than Caspar.

21:01.900 --> 21:05.800
Okay, but more to beat him with.
Jesus, Tom, the two of us
have faced worse odds.

21:06.100 --> 21:09.500
Never without reason.
It helps to have one.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.800
Well, it's your call.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.800
My opinion used to count
for something around here.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
But it's always yours
to take or leave.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.000
Come on, Tommy.
It's not like that.

21:27.700 --> 21:30.600
Goddamn it!

21:33.000 --> 21:35.700
Goddamn kid's just like a twist.

21:35.800 --> 21:38.200
Get me a stiff one.

21:39.800 --> 21:42.000
No small talk, huh?

21:44.300 --> 21:47.500
- They shoot your horse?
- If there's any justice.

21:48.900 --> 21:51.300
- Verna around?
- She stepped into
the ladies' room.

21:51.600 --> 21:54.700
- You got Lazarre's 500?
- You'll have to carry me
for a few days.

21:54.900 --> 21:57.800
He ain't gonna like that.
Couldn't you get it from Leo?

21:58.000 --> 22:01.200
It's not Leo's debt.
I'll pay me own way.

22:01.400 --> 22:03.300
I admire a man of principle.

22:05.100 --> 22:07.900
Does this go on the tab?

22:08.100 --> 22:10.700
-
- Close your eyes, ladies.
I'm coming through.

22:15.100 --> 22:18.500
- Who's the war paint for?
- Go home and dry out.

22:19.700 --> 22:21.700
You don't need it for Leo,
believe me.

22:21.900 --> 22:24.200
He already thinks you're
the original Miss Jesus.

22:24.400 --> 22:26.400
- What the hel"s
the matter with you?
- What's the matter with you?

22:26.600 --> 22:30.000
- Afraid people might get
the right idea?
- Leo's got the right idea.

22:30.300 --> 22:32.800
I like him.
He's honest and he's got a heart.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.200
Then it's true what they say--
opposites attract.

22:35.400 --> 22:38.700
- Do me a favor.
Mind your own business.
- This is my business.

22:38.900 --> 22:41.600
Intimidating helpless women
is part of what I do.

22:41.800 --> 22:43.900
- Then find one
and intimidate her.
-Leo's upstairs...

22:44.000 --> 22:46.300
getting ready to shoot himself
in the foot on your account.

22:46.500 --> 22:48.300
-I don't know
what you're talkin'about.
- He's gonna go to the mat...

22:48.500 --> 22:50.300
for your brother,
and it's gonna hurt him.

22:50.500 --> 22:52.600
I don't know Leo's business,
but he's a big boy.

22:52.800 --> 22:54.700
- He used to be.
- Look, what do you want, Tom?

22:54.900 --> 22:57.600
You want me to pretend
I don't care what happens to Bernie?

22:57.800 --> 23:00.400
Well, I do.
He's my brother. I don't
want to see him get hurt.

23:00.600 --> 23:04.800
If Leo wants to help out,
I'll step out with him,
show him a good time in return.

23:05.100 --> 23:08.300
- There's no harm in that.
- There's a name for that kind
of business arrangement.

23:08.500 --> 23:11.900
Look, I'll do what I have to do
to protect Bernie.

23:12.100 --> 23:14.400
There's no reason for you
to try and queer that.

23:14.600 --> 23:17.100
Regardless of what
you think about me,
Bernie's a decent guy.

23:17.200 --> 23:20.800
- A straight shooter, huh?
A square "G."
- Yeah.

23:20.900 --> 23:25.000
Sneer at him like everyone else,
just because he's different.

23:25.300 --> 23:27.800
People think he's a degenerate.
People think he's scum.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.500
- Well, he's not.
-Poor misunderstood Bernie.

23:31.700 --> 23:34.100
What is this about, Tom?

23:34.200 --> 23:37.500
You want me to stop seeing Leo?
Why don't you just say so?

23:39.500 --> 23:42.800
I want you to quit
spinning Leo in circles
and pointing him where to go.

23:43.100 --> 23:45.400
- I forgot. That's your job.
- I'll do what I have to do
to protect Leo.

23:45.600 --> 23:48.800
I'm asking you politely.
Leave him alone.
I don't have to ask.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.100
If I told him about our little
dance last night, your pool
would pretty soon dry up.

23:52.200 --> 23:54.200
So would yours.
I don't like being threatened.

23:54.400 --> 23:58.400
I don't like being taken for
a sucker. That might work with
Leo, but it don't work with me.

23:58.700 --> 24:01.800
Do you think last night
was just more campaigning
for my brother?

24:01.900 --> 24:03.700
I can see the angles.

24:03.900 --> 24:05.900
You know, if there was a market
for little old ladies,

24:06.100 --> 24:08.000
you'd have Grandma Bernbaum
first in line.

24:08.200 --> 24:10.800
- You're a pathetic rumhead.
- And I love you, angel.

24:27.400 --> 24:30.300
I suppose you think
you raised hell.

24:34.500 --> 24:37.900
Sister, when I've raised hell,
you'll know it.

25:14.800 --> 25:18.100
- Yeah.
- Lazarre wants
his money. He wants it now.

25:18.400 --> 25:20.800
- I need a couple of days.
- Yeah? How come is that?

25:20.900 --> 25:25.000
- Because I don't have it.
- All right, welsher, how do I
know you ain't got it?

25:25.300 --> 25:29.200
- Because I say so.
- That ain't gonna be good enough.

25:29.300 --> 25:32.800
- What would be good enough?
- Lazarre ain't gonna
like it one bit.

25:33.100 --> 25:35.900
Tell Lazarre if he's not happy,
he can send someone over
to break my legs.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.900
I won't squawk.

25:40.700 --> 25:43.300
- Hello, Bernie.
- Hello, Tom.

25:43.400 --> 25:46.900
- What's the rumpus?
-Come on in.
Make yourself at home.

25:47.200 --> 25:49.600
Yeah, you weren't here,
so I thought I'd do that.

25:49.800 --> 25:52.000
I didn't want to answer
the phone, though. I figured...

25:52.200 --> 25:54.000
it wasn't for me.

25:55.900 --> 25:58.600
I get it. Get to the point, huh?

25:58.700 --> 26:01.400
Okay. The point is,
I'm a good guy.

26:01.700 --> 26:03.600
I've heard that
from a lot of people today.

26:03.700 --> 26:05.600
Good guy, lots of friends.
That's the way it works.

26:05.600 --> 26:10.100
Maybe if you appreciated me
a little more, you wouldn't
be making waves with Leo.

26:10.400 --> 26:13.000
It's a bad time to be
doing that. Right now,
we're both in a jam.

26:13.200 --> 26:16.700
I hear you're on a bad streak.
Short of funds.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.200
Well, I got that crazy dago
mad at me.

26:20.300 --> 26:22.200
Don't ask me why.
I'm just a small-timer...

26:22.400 --> 26:24.600
trying to get by
like everyone else.

26:24.800 --> 26:27.600
I need help from my friends
like Leo and you.

26:27.800 --> 26:29.800
Leo gets your sister.
What are you sellin' me?

26:30.000 --> 26:32.300
Come on, Tom.
It's not like that at all.
It wasn't my idea.

26:32.500 --> 26:34.500
She'll sleep with anyone.
You know that.

26:34.600 --> 26:38.100
She even tried to teach me
a thing or two about bed artistry.

26:38.400 --> 26:41.100
Can you believe that?

26:41.300 --> 26:43.500
My own sister.

26:43.600 --> 26:48.600
Some crackpot idea about
saving me from my friends.

26:48.800 --> 26:50.900
She's a sick twist, all right.

26:51.100 --> 26:54.700
- She speaks highly of you.
- Yeah, well, you stick
by your family.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.400
The point is, I can help you
with your debts if that
would make us friends.

26:57.600 --> 27:00.900
My motto is,
"A guy can't have too many."

27:01.000 --> 27:04.100
Big payday Saturday, Tom.
You could be in on it.

27:04.400 --> 27:06.600
Another fix? Which fight?

27:06.800 --> 27:10.700
That's confidential
at the moment. But it
doesn't have to stay that way.

27:10.900 --> 27:13.100
How come you know
so much about it?

27:13.200 --> 27:15.300
Caspar isn't laying
any more bets with you.

27:20.400 --> 27:23.200
You really must have Mink
jumping through hoops.

27:23.300 --> 27:26.500
Like I say, you can't
have too many.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.900
- We got a deal?
- I'll think about it.

27:37.500 --> 27:39.700
I wouldn't want it any other way.

27:42.700 --> 27:45.200
Hey, Adolph.

27:47.200 --> 27:50.100
- My credit still
good with you?
- Mmm.

27:50.200 --> 27:52.800
Give me a hundred across on Tailor Made
in the third tonight.

27:53.100 --> 27:56.300
- Lazarre won't like it.
- Try 50 across.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.800
I'll try.
It's another 1 50 you'll owe him.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.300
- Only if I lose, Adolph.
- Tommy, the way you're goin'--

28:02.600 --> 28:06.000
- Hey, horses got knees?
- I don't know. Fetlocks.

28:06.100 --> 28:09.900
Well, if I was a horse,
I'd be down on my fetlocks
praying you don't bet on me.

28:10.200 --> 28:12.500
- Drift, small guy.
- Drop dead, ape.

28:12.700 --> 28:14.900
Come on, Tom.
Boss wants to see ya.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.300
He didn't have time
to engrave nothin' formal.

28:37.600 --> 28:41.900
What you mean, he's eatin' too much?
What's the goddamn doctor know?

28:43.100 --> 28:45.800
- What you eat for lunch?
- A hot dog.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.500
-Just a hot dog?
- A hot dog and mustard.

28:49.700 --> 28:54.100
A hot dog and mustard.

28:54.400 --> 28:57.500
A hot dog and mustard!

28:59.300 --> 29:03.200
You hear that, Dane?
My kid is as smart as a whip.

29:03.500 --> 29:06.100
Even Uncle Eddie
thinks that's funny.

29:06.300 --> 29:09.100
Okay.

29:10.400 --> 29:13.800
Go ahead. Which hand
is the penny in?

29:15.100 --> 29:17.600
Choose again.

29:21.800 --> 29:24.800
Okay. Here you go.
Take the penny.
Shiny new penny.

29:25.100 --> 29:28.700
Take the kid,
wait in the car.
Give him a penny, boys!

29:30.700 --> 29:34.500
- I ain't got a penny, boss.
- That's a penny you owe him.

29:34.700 --> 29:38.100
Hello, Tom. What's the rumpus?
You like kids?

29:38.300 --> 29:41.400
- No.
- Have a seat. Go ahead.

29:43.100 --> 29:44.900
Well, you're missin' out
on a complete life.

29:45.100 --> 29:47.500
I know, kids, big deal.

29:47.700 --> 29:50.500
Still, I'm telling you.

29:50.600 --> 29:54.100
Anyways, thanks for comin' by.

29:55.700 --> 29:58.200
I just wrote this check out
to your bookmaker Lazarre.

29:58.400 --> 30:01.000
It's for an even 1,500,
which is more than I hear
you owe him,

30:01.200 --> 30:04.400
but I figured you could always
use some money on the cuff,
a high roller such as yourself.

30:04.700 --> 30:07.600
- What do you say?
- Thanks.

30:09.800 --> 30:12.100
Always the yapper, huh?

30:12.300 --> 30:16.500
Well, you're welcome.
You wanna know why I'm puttin'
you square with Lazarre?

30:16.700 --> 30:19.900
- Not particularly.
- I want everybody to be friends.

30:20.100 --> 30:22.400
I do this, you're friends
with Lazarre,

30:22.500 --> 30:25.100
he's friends with you,
you're friends with me.

30:25.300 --> 30:29.500
All you gotta do
to show you're a friend
is give me Bernie Bernbaum.

30:29.800 --> 30:33.100
You know it's
the right thing anyway.
The shmatte steals from me.

30:33.300 --> 30:37.200
I can't have Leo giving him
a shiny new penny.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.400
So the deal is,
I give you Bernie,

30:39.600 --> 30:42.000
smooth it over with Leo
and you bail me out with Lazarre.

30:42.200 --> 30:44.300
Yeah. Then we're all
friends again.

30:44.400 --> 30:47.000
You, me, Leo, the Dane.

30:47.200 --> 30:50.700
- We can maybe
have tea sometime.
- Come on, Eddie.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.800
Friends is a mental state.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.500
- What do you say, kid?
- I'll think about it.

30:57.800 --> 31:00.300
You'll think about it.

31:00.500 --> 31:03.400
You hear that, Dane?
The kid's a thinker.
That's terrific.

31:03.600 --> 31:07.300
- Does he want
a pillow for his head?
- Okay, kid. Think about it.

31:07.500 --> 31:11.200
It's a mental state.
If it'll help you think,

31:11.400 --> 31:13.800
you should know that if
you don't do this thing,

31:14.100 --> 31:16.500
you're not gonna be
in any shape to walk out of here.

31:18.400 --> 31:21.800
Would that be physically,
or just a mental state?

31:29.000 --> 31:32.200
That ain't friendly, kid.
I make you a nice offer,

31:32.400 --> 31:34.800
you give me the high hat.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.900
Hold it.

32:30.600 --> 32:33.700
Jesus, Tom.

33:14.300 --> 33:16.400
Just in the nick of time, huh?

33:20.500 --> 33:24.100
Well, no harm done.
Unless your friend broke his foot.

33:24.300 --> 33:27.500
- Where am I?
- Where are you? Johnny
Caspar's pleasure dome.

33:27.800 --> 33:30.600
Same as when you left us
about ten seconds ago.

33:30.800 --> 33:33.100
Hello, Tom. How are ya?

33:33.200 --> 33:35.300
Care to scrape a knuckle
on your playmate here?

33:35.500 --> 33:38.200
- No. Thanks though, Andy.
- Well, if you
change your mind,

33:38.300 --> 33:41.500
we'll be interrogating
for a while.

33:41.700 --> 33:44.900
- What was that party
about, anyway?
- We do this every weekend.

33:45.200 --> 33:47.700
Jesus, what is the matter
with you people?

33:47.900 --> 33:50.600
Well, they said make it hurt,
so we make it hurt.

33:57.100 --> 33:58.900
Drink, O'Doole?

33:59.100 --> 34:01.200
I'm on duty.

34:01.400 --> 34:04.100
To Volstead.

34:05.600 --> 34:07.600
-
- Any news about Rug?

34:07.800 --> 34:10.199
Still dead, far as I know.

34:10.300 --> 34:13.000
- Get a slug out of him?
- Yeah, .22.

34:13.100 --> 34:15.699
Listen, Tom, I'm just
the chief around here,

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
so don't bother tellin' me
if you don't happen to
feel like it,

34:18.100 --> 34:19.900
but what the hell is Leo doin'?

34:20.100 --> 34:24.400
Make him listen to you, Tom.
It ain't right, all this fuss
over one sheeny.

34:24.600 --> 34:27.400
Let Caspar have Bernie.
What's one Hebrew more or less?

34:27.600 --> 34:29.500
We're burnin'
our meal ticket here.

34:29.600 --> 34:31.800
Leo will do what suits him,
and you'll do what he tells you.

34:31.900 --> 34:33.800
Last I heard, Leo was still
running this town.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.500
Yeah, well, he won't be
for long if this keeps up.

34:36.699 --> 34:39.300
It's no good for anyone.
You said as much yourself.

34:39.500 --> 34:43.500
First off, O'Doole, I can
say what I please to Leo
and about him.

34:43.800 --> 34:45.699
You can't.

34:45.900 --> 34:49.300
Second, once Leo decides,
that's that.

34:49.500 --> 34:51.800
If that sticks going down,
there are plenty
of coppers I know...

34:52.000 --> 34:54.699
who wouldn't mind
bein' chief and could
swallow it clean.

34:55.000 --> 34:58.900
Jesus, Tom,
I was just speculatin'
about a hypothesis.

34:59.100 --> 35:01.100
I know I don't
know nothin'.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.500
It's just a--
just a damn mess, is all.

35:27.900 --> 35:29.800
Hello, Officer. I'd like to
report an intruder...

35:29.900 --> 35:32.900
at 346 West Lewis--

35:33.000 --> 35:36.500
Who's this?
Hello, Shad. Tom Reagan here.

35:36.800 --> 35:39.400
- You need the booze?
- No, we won't be
needing any today.

35:39.600 --> 35:42.300
- False alarm, huh?
- Yeah. My mother.
She didn't recognize me.

35:42.500 --> 35:44.700
Let me talk to Mulveany.
Miss me?

35:44.900 --> 35:47.200
Drop dead.

35:47.400 --> 35:49.400
- Mulveany here.
- Sean?

35:49.500 --> 35:51.400
Tell O'Doole to get a car
over to Leo's tonight.

35:51.600 --> 35:54.400
If we're banging away
at Caspar, we oughta be ready
for him to bang back.

35:54.600 --> 35:56.700
-
- What do you want?

35:56.900 --> 36:00.500
I was in the neighborhood,
feeling a bit daffy,

36:00.800 --> 36:03.600
so I thought I'd drop in
for an aperitif.

36:05.500 --> 36:08.300
- Rug Daniels is dead.
- Gee, that's tough.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.600
Don't get hysterical.

36:10.800 --> 36:14.200
I've had enough excitement
for one night without a dame
going all weepy on me.

36:14.400 --> 36:16.400
- I barely knew the gentleman.
-Rug?

36:16.600 --> 36:20.800
A bit of a shakedown artist,
not above the occasional grift.

36:21.100 --> 36:24.700
Bet you'd understand that.
All in all, not a bad guy,

36:25.000 --> 36:28.200
if looks, brains
and personality don't count.

36:28.400 --> 36:31.000
- You better hope they don't.
- Yeah, well--

36:31.100 --> 36:33.600
We're none of us the saint
I hear your brother is.

36:33.800 --> 36:35.900
- Who killed him?
- Leo thinks Caspar did.

36:36.100 --> 36:38.000
- But you know better.
- I do now.

36:38.100 --> 36:41.300
You see, Caspar just tried
to buy me into fixing
his tiff with Leo,

36:41.500 --> 36:44.200
which he'd hardly do
if he was waging war.

36:44.400 --> 36:48.300
So I figure you killed him, angel.
You or St. Bernard.

36:48.400 --> 36:52.100
Why would I or my brother
kill Rug Daniels or anybody else?

36:52.300 --> 36:56.200
Rug was following you.
He knew about you and me,

36:56.500 --> 36:59.000
and that wouldn't help
your play with Leo, would it?

36:59.200 --> 37:01.200
You think I murdered someone?

37:01.400 --> 37:04.300
Come on, Tom.
You know me a little.

37:04.500 --> 37:06.900
Nobody knows anybody.
Not that well.

37:07.100 --> 37:09.200
You know, or you
wouldn't be here.

37:09.400 --> 37:12.600
Not at all, sugar.
I came to hear your side of the story.

37:12.800 --> 37:17.200
How horrible Rug was,
how he goaded you into it,
how he tried to shake you down.

37:17.500 --> 37:19.500
- That's not why
you came either.
- Tell me why I came.

37:19.700 --> 37:22.700
- The oldest reason there is.
- There are friendlier
places to drink.

37:22.900 --> 37:24.800
- Why can't you admit it?
- Admit what?

37:24.900 --> 37:28.100
That you don't like
me seeing Leo
'cause you're jealous.

37:28.300 --> 37:30.500
Admit that you've
got a heart,

37:30.700 --> 37:33.100
even though it may be
small and feeble...

37:33.200 --> 37:35.300
and you can't remember
the last time you used it.

37:35.500 --> 37:38.500
If I'd known we were gonna
cast our feelings into words,

37:38.700 --> 37:41.200
I'd have memorized
the Song of Solomon.

37:43.400 --> 37:46.500
Maybe that's why
I like you, Tom.

37:46.600 --> 37:49.300
I never knew anybody
that made being
a son of a bitch...

37:49.600 --> 37:52.200
such a point of pride.

37:52.300 --> 37:55.200
Though one day you'll
pay the price for it.

37:56.700 --> 38:00.400
Okay, Verna.
But until then, let's get stinko.

38:00.600 --> 38:03.000
Let's do something else first.

38:07.900 --> 38:10.200
Yeah. Let's do plenty.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.700
- Who's winning?
- We are, for the nonce.

42:10.800 --> 42:14.800
- What's the "disposish"?
- Last night, four to one. Dana
Cudahy went up with the house.

42:15.100 --> 42:17.200
- And theirs?
- One burned.

42:17.400 --> 42:19.100
- The other three?
- Lead.

42:19.200 --> 42:21.200
- Whose?
- Leo's.

42:21.300 --> 42:23.500
The old man's still
an artist with a Thompson.

42:23.700 --> 42:25.600
Yeah, do that.

42:25.600 --> 42:29.400
Well, find him, goddamn it!
Go and see if he fell in the john.

42:31.100 --> 42:33.900
Son of a bitch. No chief.

42:34.100 --> 42:37.300
- Who's mindin' the goddamn store?
-Can't raise O'Doole?

42:37.500 --> 42:39.500
No, nor the mayor either.

42:39.700 --> 42:43.900
- That's not good.
They're running.
- They wouldn't dare!

42:44.100 --> 42:46.700
I don't know, Leo.
I warned you not to
hit Caspar's club.

42:46.900 --> 42:49.600
- I'm still here, ain't I?
-Caspar's play hurt you anyway.

42:49.700 --> 42:52.100
That sorry son of a bitch
just slit his own throat.

42:52.300 --> 42:55.300
Listen to me, Leo.
Last night made you
look vulnerable.

42:55.600 --> 42:58.900
You don't hold elected office
in this town. You run it
because people think you run it.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.700
Once they stop thinking it,
you stop running it.

43:01.900 --> 43:05.100
Jesus, Tom. It sounds like
a bad break for me
I wasn't killed!

43:05.400 --> 43:08.300
I mean it, Leo.
Start taking Caspar seriously.

43:08.500 --> 43:12.600
I know, I know.
Retreat to win, give up Bernie.
That'll solve all our problems.

43:12.800 --> 43:14.800
Won't anymore, I'll grant you that.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.400
But going toe-to-toe
with a psychopath
will get you nowhere.

43:17.500 --> 43:20.100
It'll force people
to choose sides just when
you're looking shaky.

43:20.300 --> 43:23.400
- The hell I do!
- Then where's the mayor?

43:23.600 --> 43:25.800
Why aren't there
any police here?

43:25.900 --> 43:27.900
Why weren't there any police
at your place last night?

43:28.000 --> 43:30.500
- I didn't ask for any.
- I did.

43:33.800 --> 43:36.500
Mother hen, huh?
What's the matter, Tommy?

43:36.700 --> 43:40.100
- Don't you think
I can take care of myself?
- I know you can't.

43:40.300 --> 43:43.000
Here's the smart play, Leo.
You lay back, you give Bernie up,

43:43.200 --> 43:45.100
you let Caspar think
he's made his point.

43:45.300 --> 43:48.100
- Then you wait for him
to show a weakness.
- Please, Tom.

43:48.400 --> 43:50.500
You're sticking on Bernie.
You're sticking your neck out...

43:50.700 --> 43:53.500
for a guy who'd chop you off
at the heels if there
was two bits in it.

43:56.100 --> 43:58.700
Tom,

43:58.900 --> 44:02.100
things aren't as, uh,
clear-cut as you make it.

44:03.800 --> 44:07.800
Bernie's--
Well, hell,you know
about me and Verna.

44:08.000 --> 44:11.700
Things now are, uh--

44:11.900 --> 44:15.500
Not that I haven't
been a gentleman, but--

44:17.800 --> 44:21.100
I plan to ask her
to marry me, Tom.

44:25.900 --> 44:29.200
I guess you think
that's a bonehead play.

44:33.600 --> 44:37.200
- You think she wants you to?
- How the hell do I know?

44:37.500 --> 44:40.100
I think she does.
Yeah, of course she does.

44:40.300 --> 44:44.000
I know you think different,
but, well, we just, uh--

44:44.200 --> 44:46.500
We just differ on that.

44:49.400 --> 44:52.400
Leo, Caspar didn't kill Rug.

44:52.600 --> 44:56.200
- Course he did.
- No. Think about it
just this one time.

44:56.500 --> 44:58.400
- Who was Rug following?
- Huh?

44:58.600 --> 45:02.000
It needn't have been that
sinister. Strange man follows
her down a dark alleyway.

45:02.200 --> 45:04.500
- I told you she can
look after herself.
- Verna wouldn't panic,

45:04.600 --> 45:07.700
shoot someone just because
he was following her.

45:07.900 --> 45:11.500
Nah, it wouldn't have happened
like that, and if it had
she would have told me.

45:11.800 --> 45:14.900
They pulled a .22 slug out of him.
A pop gun, Leo, a woman's gun.

45:15.100 --> 45:17.200
I know you don't
like her, Tom,

45:17.300 --> 45:20.200
but I trust Verna
as much as I trust you.

45:21.900 --> 45:23.800
Okay, Leo.

45:23.900 --> 45:26.100
Maybe it wasn't that innocent.

45:26.300 --> 45:29.800
Maybe Rug knew something
she didn't like him knowing
and wouldn't want you to know.

45:30.100 --> 45:33.600
Rug was following her.
Maybe he knew
where she was sleeping,

45:33.800 --> 45:35.600
and who with.

45:39.800 --> 45:42.200
Maybes don't make it so.

45:43.400 --> 45:45.300
There's more than maybes.

45:45.500 --> 45:48.900
You've trusted me before,
you've never lost anything
by it. Trust me on this.

45:51.900 --> 45:55.200
- This is too important.
- I don't ask much,
and I don't ask often.

45:55.400 --> 45:57.700
Trust me on this.

45:57.900 --> 46:01.000
- Tommy.
- Trust me on this,
or to hell with you.

46:03.800 --> 46:06.000
You don't mean that.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.800
She was with me...

46:10.900 --> 46:14.200
the night Rug
was following her,

46:14.400 --> 46:16.300
the night you dropped by.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.300
Oh.

48:28.500 --> 48:31.200
Okay, Leo. Okay.
I'll throw him out.

48:33.400 --> 48:35.900
Yeah, do that.

48:37.100 --> 48:39.200
It's the kiss-off.

48:39.400 --> 48:42.600
If I never see him again,
it'll be soon enough.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
- Hello?
- Hello, Frankie.

48:55.100 --> 48:57.500
It's Tom.
How's the flunky business?

48:58.900 --> 49:01.100
I've had worse.
Your ventilator mending?

49:01.300 --> 49:04.300
-
- Tell Caspar it's forgotten.

49:04.500 --> 49:06.800
- I'd like to see him.

49:08.600 --> 49:10.700
Ah. All right, let me know.

49:56.100 --> 49:59.900
It worked, whatever you did.

50:00.200 --> 50:03.400
Leo says we're quits.

50:03.600 --> 50:06.200
But you know I didn't have
anything to do with Rug.

50:06.300 --> 50:09.000
Maybe not.

50:09.200 --> 50:11.100
Anyway, that isn't
what soured him on you.

50:11.300 --> 50:13.500
Oh, you and me, huh?

50:15.300 --> 50:18.800
You always take
the long way around to get
what you want, don't you, Tom?

50:21.100 --> 50:23.400
You could have just asked.

50:26.400 --> 50:29.200
What did I want?

50:29.400 --> 50:31.900
Me.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.700
Yeah?

51:00.800 --> 51:02.700
Yeah, yeah.

51:02.900 --> 51:05.100
When?

51:05.300 --> 51:07.100
Okay.

51:12.100 --> 51:14.700
You still up?

51:14.900 --> 51:17.000
Yeah.

51:20.900 --> 51:23.800
What are you chewin' over?

51:24.100 --> 51:26.200
Dream I had once.

51:28.200 --> 51:31.000
I was walking in the woods.
I don't know why.

51:32.700 --> 51:35.700
Wind came whippin'.
Blew me hat off.

51:37.800 --> 51:40.600
And you chased it, right?

51:40.800 --> 51:43.100
You ran and ran.

51:43.300 --> 51:46.300
You finally caught up to it.

51:46.600 --> 51:50.500
And you picked it up,
but it wasn't a hat anymore.

51:50.800 --> 51:54.600
It had changed into something else,
something wonderful.

51:54.700 --> 51:57.500
No, it stayed a hat.

51:57.600 --> 52:00.000
And no, I didn't chase it.

52:01.500 --> 52:05.200
Nothing more foolish
than a man chasin' his hat.

52:05.500 --> 52:07.600
Where are you going?

52:07.800 --> 52:10.400
Just have to do a few things.

52:10.600 --> 52:13.900
- You and Leo might still
be able to patch things up.
- Me and Leo are finished.

52:14.100 --> 52:17.400
-Nothing's gonna change that.
- You never know.

52:17.700 --> 52:21.300
- He's got a big heart.
- We're quits as far as I'm
concerned, never mind him.

52:21.500 --> 52:25.600
And if Leo did want me back,
he's an even bigger sap
than I thought.

52:25.900 --> 52:28.300
Then why don't we just
pick up and leave town?

52:28.400 --> 52:31.200
There's nothing keeping you here.

52:31.300 --> 52:33.200
I know there's nothing keeping me.

52:33.400 --> 52:36.600
- What about Bernie?
- He could go with us.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
You, me and Bernie?
Where would we go, Verna?

52:40.200 --> 52:42.100
Niagara Falls?

52:42.200 --> 52:44.100
Why do you hate him?

52:44.200 --> 52:46.100
- I don't hate anyone.
-Or like anyone.

52:51.200 --> 52:53.300
Where is Bernie?

52:53.400 --> 52:55.800
- Why?
- Leo can't protect him anymore.

52:56.000 --> 52:59.300
I oughta tell him to skip.

52:59.600 --> 53:01.400
The Royale, room 302.

53:06.800 --> 53:10.300
I guess we both
double-crossed Leo, huh?

53:10.500 --> 53:12.300
There's no gettin' around that.

53:13.600 --> 53:16.300
I guess he's well rid
of both of us.

53:16.500 --> 53:20.700
The two of us, we're about
bad enough to deserve each other.

53:24.300 --> 53:26.200
Are we?

53:28.400 --> 53:31.200
We're a couple of heels, Tom.

53:31.300 --> 53:33.900
Yes, we are.

53:34.200 --> 53:38.400
So he says,
"Screw him. Give him a dollar.
This was my idea. "

53:38.700 --> 53:42.200
Hello, Tom.

53:42.500 --> 53:45.600
Uh, you know O'Doole
and the mayor.

53:45.800 --> 53:48.900
- Hello, boys.
- Tom's a big booster.
Always has been.

53:49.100 --> 53:53.000
That's fine, that's fine.
Well, Tom and I got
the proverbial fat to chew.

53:53.300 --> 53:56.000
-Just let us know
if you need anything.
- Yeah. Happy days.

53:56.200 --> 53:59.100
Have a seat, kid.
Yeah, that's it.

53:59.400 --> 54:02.600
So,you had enough time
to think about things?

54:02.700 --> 54:06.700
- Yeah, well, uh,
circumstances have changed.
- Don't I know it.

54:06.900 --> 54:09.900
Last night I know the Dane
was disappointed
the bulls showed up...

54:10.100 --> 54:12.600
before Frankie and Tic-Tac
really pinned your ears back,

54:12.800 --> 54:17.100
but I said, "Relax, Eddie.
I got a feeling about this kid.

54:17.400 --> 54:21.400
The kid and Leo
are gonna go bust-o.
Matter of time."

54:21.700 --> 54:24.300
I said, "The kid
is too smart for Leo."
That's what I said.

54:24.400 --> 54:27.400
Like a psychic.
Ask the Dane if I did.
Like a goddamn psychic.

54:27.500 --> 54:29.900
-Go ahead, ask him.
- You vouch for that
psychic business?

54:30.100 --> 54:32.600
- That's right, smart guy.
-I know you knew...

54:32.700 --> 54:35.600
protecting the shmatte
was a dumb idea.

54:35.900 --> 54:39.500
I know you've been wise
to all of Leo's dumb ideas lately.

54:39.600 --> 54:41.700
Only a matter of time-- bust-o.

54:41.800 --> 54:44.900
That's why last night
we didn't put the arm on you,
only Leo.

54:45.000 --> 54:48.400
Seeing how you squiffed
your play on Leo,
I can only be so grateful.

54:48.700 --> 54:52.800
- Oh, that's real brave coming
from Little Miss Punching Bag.
- Okay, Eddie.

54:53.100 --> 54:56.200
- Friends now, huh?
- Nuts.

54:58.000 --> 54:59.900
So, I guess you'll be
looking for a job, eh, kid?

55:00.000 --> 55:02.600
I might be.

55:02.700 --> 55:04.700
You got references?
You been to college?

55:04.800 --> 55:08.200
We only take yeggs
what's been to college.
Ain't that right, Dane?

55:11.200 --> 55:14.300
I'm joking, of course.
We all know you could be
useful to us,

55:14.600 --> 55:16.400
a smart kid such as yourself.

55:16.500 --> 55:20.100
The man who walks behind the man,
who whispers in his ear.

55:20.400 --> 55:23.900
- I guess you could be
useful in spades.
- Yeah, I can do plenty for you.

55:24.200 --> 55:28.400
- Can you get Leo off me?
- I'm tellin' you
not to worry about Leo.

55:28.600 --> 55:30.500
- We got plans for him.
- Oh,yeah?

55:30.600 --> 55:33.300
- Like what?
- Not so fast there, "kaputnik."

55:33.500 --> 55:35.900
I-I think what the Dane
is trying to say is,

55:36.200 --> 55:38.100
there'll be time
to talk about that.

55:38.100 --> 55:40.400
We can table that
for a later date.

55:42.000 --> 55:46.400
See, last time we jawed,
you gave me the high hat.

55:46.700 --> 55:49.100
I guess I'm sayin'...

55:49.300 --> 55:52.700
you gotta put something
on the table first.

55:52.800 --> 55:55.500
- Ante up.
- Fair enough. Where do we start?

55:55.700 --> 55:59.100
Hear that, Dane? All business.
I told you he was a good kid.

55:59.300 --> 56:01.400
"Where do we start?"
All business.

56:01.600 --> 56:04.500
Well, we can start, for instance,
with the shmatte.

56:04.700 --> 56:06.600
Like, where's the shmatte?
You could maybe tell us that.

56:06.700 --> 56:10.700
The Royale, room 302.
And you might find Mink with him.

56:11.000 --> 56:12.900
The hell you say.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.100
Sure. Bernie and Mink
are cozy as lice.

56:15.200 --> 56:18.400
- And it ain't just business.
- This guy is lying.

56:18.600 --> 56:20.400
- Why would I?
- This guy is wrong.

56:20.600 --> 56:25.500
This guy is all wrong.
Mink is clean and this clown
is a smart guy.

56:27.500 --> 56:29.400
It's easy enough to find out,
ain't it?

56:30.700 --> 56:35.000
You find Mink,
you bring him back here.

56:36.900 --> 56:40.700
Go to the car.
I'm gonna send Frankie and
Tic-Tac with you to the Royale.

56:40.900 --> 56:43.100
If Bernie's there,

56:43.200 --> 56:45.500
Frankie and Tic-Tac'll
take care of him.

56:45.700 --> 56:48.000
And if he's not there?

56:48.100 --> 56:51.400
I'll sit facing the corner
in a funny hat.

56:53.200 --> 56:55.800
- Get your little hebe ass
in the car.

56:55.900 --> 56:58.000
- Let's go.
Come on,you skel.

56:58.100 --> 57:00.100
What are you doing to me?

57:00.300 --> 57:02.300
- We're going to
Miller's Crossing.
-I didn't do-- Tom! Tom!

57:02.500 --> 57:04.900
- Lock him up.
Jesus! Are you part of this?

57:05.000 --> 57:07.100
- Sit still, hymie.
- You can't be part of this.

57:07.300 --> 57:09.900
I think these guys
are gonna whack me!
Tom,you gotta talk to 'em!

57:10.000 --> 57:12.800
- You're giving me a headache,
you little sheeny. Let's go!
- Talk to 'em!

57:16.000 --> 57:18.300
Get me outta here!

57:18.400 --> 57:20.800
Oh, Tommy.!

57:21.000 --> 57:22.900
Get him outta here!
- Frankie!

57:23.100 --> 57:25.900
- Come on! Come on!

57:28.300 --> 57:30.300
- Tic-Tac!
- Quiet him down!

57:30.500 --> 57:32.400
Uuh!

57:32.400 --> 57:34.500
- Get up, you skel!

57:34.600 --> 57:36.600
- Come on.
- Frankie, no!

57:36.800 --> 57:40.100
- Get up, you son of a bitch.
- Frank-- Aah!

57:40.400 --> 57:42.900
- Oh, Frankie!
- Get up, you kike!

57:43.100 --> 57:46.800
Okay, take him in the woods
and whack him.

57:47.100 --> 57:49.200
- What?
- That's right.

57:49.300 --> 57:52.100
The boss wants you to do it.
Make sure you're with the good guys.

57:52.400 --> 57:55.100
- You know how to do this, right?
- You little yid! Get up!

57:55.300 --> 57:57.300
Ya gotta remember
to put one in his brain.

57:57.500 --> 58:00.400
Your first shot puts him down.
Then you put one in his brain.

58:00.500 --> 58:02.500
Then he's dead.
Then we go home.

58:06.300 --> 58:08.400
Get up and walk.

58:08.600 --> 58:10.800
I can't get up. I can't get up.

58:11.000 --> 58:15.900
- Get up and walk,
you pissing little yid!
- Let's go!

58:36.100 --> 58:39.100
Tommy, you can't do this.
You don't bump guys.

58:39.200 --> 58:41.500
You're not like
those animals back there.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.100
It's not right, Tom.

58:46.300 --> 58:48.600
They can't make us do this.

58:48.800 --> 58:52.800
It's a wrong situation.
They can't make us
different people than we are.

58:53.100 --> 58:55.000
We're not muscle.
I never killed anybody.

58:55.100 --> 58:57.600
I used a little information
for a chisel, that's all.

58:57.800 --> 59:00.300
It's my nature, Tom.
I can't help it.

59:00.500 --> 59:04.200
Somebody hands me an angle,
I play it. I don't deserve
to die for that.

59:04.400 --> 59:06.200
Do you think I do?

59:08.100 --> 59:11.600
I'm just a grifter.
Huh, Tom? I'm a nobody!

59:11.800 --> 59:15.100
But I tell you what--
I never crossed a friend.

59:15.400 --> 59:17.700
I never killed anybody,
I never crossed a friend.

59:17.900 --> 59:19.700
We're not like those animals.

59:19.900 --> 59:21.700
This is not us.

59:21.900 --> 59:24.400
This is a dream!

59:24.600 --> 59:27.700
It's a dream, Tommy!
I'm praying to you!

59:27.800 --> 59:29.700
I can't die.

59:29.900 --> 59:31.700
I can't die...

59:31.900 --> 59:35.500
out here in the woods
like a dumb animal.

59:35.600 --> 59:38.000
In the woods like a dumb animal!

59:38.100 --> 59:41.000
Like a--
Like a dumb animal!

59:41.300 --> 59:44.800
I can't--
I can't-- I can't die
out here in the woods...

59:45.000 --> 59:47.500
like a dumb animal.

59:47.700 --> 59:50.900
I can't... die!

59:54.900 --> 59:56.700
I'm praying to you.

59:58.800 --> 01:00:01.200
Look in your heart.

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:03.400
I'm praying to you.

01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:08.800
Look in your heart.
I'm praying to you.

01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:11.700
Look in your heart.

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:15.100
I'm praying to you!

01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:17.300
Look in your heart!

01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:21.900
I'm praying to you!
Look in your heart.

01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:25.100
I'm praying to you!

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:29.500
Look in your heart!
Look in your heart!

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:31.900
You can't kill me.

01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:34.900
- Look in your heart.

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:53.100
- Tommy--
- Shut up. You're dead. Get me?

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:58.300
I understand. I'm dead.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.800
- God bless you.
-Shut up.

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:04.200
You have to disappear for good.
No one can see you.
No one can know.

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:07.600
- God bless you.
-Go somewhere no one knows you.

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:11.100
Anyone sees you,
you really are dead.
You're not my problem anymore.

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:13.700
Of course not.
You've done your share. Thank you.

01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:16.700
- Don't worry. I understand.
-Shut up. Shut up.

01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:20.300
- Thank you.
- Shut up. Get out of here
before I change my mind.

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:23.000
God bless you.

01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:56.000
Put one in his brain?

01:01:57.300 --> 01:01:59.300
- Yeah.
Atta boy.

01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:18.300
Mink? Tom Reagan.
Where you been?

01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:27.700
Will you look?
Eddie Dane's been looking for you.

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:29.700
- Bernie's dead.
-Jesus Christ!

01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:33.900
Stop wailing and listen to me.
Caspar knows you were
in on selling out his fix.

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:36.400
- Who the hell
gave him that idea?
- Heh!

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:40.000
- I guess I gave him that idea.
Sorry. It just slipped out.
- What are you trying to do?

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:43.000
Shut up and let me talk.
You lay low till Caspar
cools off.

01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:47.800
Then tell him the Dane was in
on the sellout, and I'll
make Caspar go easy on you.

01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:50.900
- You got me into this mess.
- That's right, I got you into this.

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:54.500
-Just remember, Mink, I'm the
only one who can get you out.
- Wait a minute, Tom.

01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:57.400
Waah! Uuh!

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:08.300
Hello, Terry.
Getting out the vote?

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:13.900
A message from Leo.
Leo says if you're smart
you'll sit this one out,

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:16.600
not that he cares one way
or the other.

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:21.100
Leo says if you're on
the wrong side you take
your chances like anybody else.

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:23.800
Leo says he gives
no special favors, that's all.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.800
Tell Leo he's not God
on the throne.

01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:30.600
He's just a cheap political boss
with more hair tonic than brains.

01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:34.200
Uhh!

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Did Leo say that as well?

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.000
No, I said that.

01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:44.600
Cross Leo,
next time I'll say plenty.

01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:54.800
When you're right,you're right.

01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:58.100
But you never say,
"I told you so."

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.400
So what am I right about?

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:04.400
Well, I'll tell you.

01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:08.200
But first you gotta promise
not to say I told you so.

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:12.400
I never say that,
and I don't like people who do.

01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:17.500
Mink was robbing me
right along with the shmatte.

01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:19.500
What convinced you of that?

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:21.800
Mink took a powder.
We can't find him.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.300
The Dane, he's making
excuses for him.

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:26.800
But personally,
I think you was right.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.500
I think that Mink and Bernie
was in it together.

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:33.100
I think Mink heard
that you bumped
the shmatte and lit out.

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:35.400
Lousy son of a bitch.

01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:40.700
- I told you so.
- What?

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:46.600
You got a lip on you.
That's all right.

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:49.800
I don't generally care for it,
but that's all right.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:54.000
You was a good sport
to bump the shmatte.

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:57.200
How do you know
Mink skipped?

01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:00.100
- Because the Dane can't find him.
- So he says.

01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:04.200
- Meaning what exactly?
-Maybe nothing.

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:08.400
I didn't give it much thought,
'cause a guy'll say anything
when his number is up.

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:11.300
But, uh,just before
I bumped Bernie,

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:14.400
he swore to me
that Eddie Dane and Mink
were setting him up--

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:17.400
that they were the ones
who sold out your fix.

01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:28.000
Well, uh--

01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:30.400
Well, like you say, uh,
a guy'll say anything.

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:32.900
So why isn't
Eddie Dane here?

01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:37.200
Well, he don't
care for you, kid.

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:41.200
Maybe it's only fair to tell you.

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:44.800
After you left us,
he tried to sell me
on a double-cross.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.800
He says to me,
why don't we double-cross you
and give you the bump...

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.800
after we get the shmatte.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.800
Well, I figure a dea"s a deal.
You're square with me.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.500
You bump the shmatte,
I hold up my end.
It's a question of ethics.

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:02.900
Everything above board so
everybody knows who's a friend,
who's an enemy.

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:07.500
So the Dane doesn't like you,
but he wouldn't cross me.

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:09.500
We go back.

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:16.500
Of course there's always
that wild card when,
uh, love is involved.

01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:21.700
I know Mink
is Eddie Dane's boy.

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:26.300
Still, I--
I don't make it that way.

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:31.400
- Then there's nothing
to worry about.
- Yeah.

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:35.800
Papa, Papa, I got a prize
from the sister! Papa, Papa,
I got a prize from the sister!

01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:39.400
- Papa, Papa, I got a prize
from the sister!
- Yeah.Just a minute.

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:41.600
- Of course, then, there's
no reason-- Shut up!
- Papa, Papa, I got--

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:45.100
You take a page
out of this guy's book.

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:49.100
- A little less you talk,
a little more you think!

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:53.800
Kids. You gotta be firm.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.500
Anyways, there's no reason
not to check things out.

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:02.100
If Mink is around,
I want you to find him.
He can tell us what's what.

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:05.200
What's the matter?
Somebody hit you?

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:08.200
What's the matter?
Aren't we friends anymore?

01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:11.200
If you find him,
I wanna talk to him alone.

01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:13.800
That's the way you get
the straight dope--man to man.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.600
Just me, Mink...
and my friend Roscoe.

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:20.400
You understand
what I'm saying?

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:22.900
- It ain't complicated.

01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:37.900
You should leave town
for a few days. Things are
gonna heat up around here.

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:40.500
Go to the Palisades.
I'll join you soon as I'm done.

01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:43.500
I can't find Bernie.
Did you find him?

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.800
Yeah.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.100
Is he leaving?

01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:53.500
He, uh-- He left.

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:56.200
- He say where to?
- He didn't say.

01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:58.500
- You--
- Thanks.

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:15.400
- What's that
potato-eater up to?
- Beats me.

01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:18.000
- That's Bernie's sister, ain't it?
- Beats me.

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:20.500
- What's he seeing her for?
- Beats me. Maybe--

01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:24.300
Shut up. Get lost.

01:08:24.399 --> 01:08:26.899
I'll see where
the twist flops.

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:31.600
You know who I am?

01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:34.300
Yeah,Johnny Caspar's shadow.
What, did he stay in bed today?

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:38.399
Jesus. I open my mouth,
the whole world turns smart.

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:42.000
- You're Leo's twist, right?
- Me and Leo are through.

01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:44.899
Yeah?
So you're sluttin' around
with Tom now, huh?

01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:47.700
You get outta here.

01:08:47.899 --> 01:08:50.100
Okay. See you later.

01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:54.600
Before I go,
what's your boyfriend up to?

01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:56.800
- Nothing I know about.
- Yeah?

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
That doesn't
figure for me--

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:02.200
you dumpin' Leo for the guy
who put a bullet in your brother.

01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:10.700
He didn't tell you. Aww.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.800
Spin her, Eddie.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.399
Ooh!

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:36.500
- You Leo's?
- Yeah. He wanted her
looked-out for.

01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:40.800
Well,you did a bang-upjob.
I'll be sure to tell him.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.899
- Where's Leo?
- If I tell you, how do I know
you won't kill me?

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:50.200
Because if you told me and I
killed you and you were lying,
I wouldn't get to kill you then.

01:09:50.399 --> 01:09:53.000
- Where's Leo?
- He's moving around.

01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:57.100
- He's getting his mob together
tomorrow at Whiskey Nick's.
- You sure?

01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:59.200
Check it. It's gold.

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:02.900
You know what,yegg?
I believe you.

01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:27.100
Go ahead and run, sweetie.

01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:30.600
I'll track down
all of you whores.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.600
Hello, Bernie. Come on in.
Make yourself at home.

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:37.700
Hello, Tom.

01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:41.500
I thought I'd do that,
since you didn't seem to be in.

01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:45.800
Figured it was a bad idea
to wait in the hall, seeing
as I'm supposed to be dead.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.400
How'd you know it was me?

01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:53.900
You're the only one I know
who'd knock and then break in.

01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:56.000
Your other friends
wouldn't break in?

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:59.200
My other friends
want to kill me,
so they wouldn't knock.

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:01.800
What's on your mind. Bernie?

01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:06.600
Things.

01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:12.000
I guess you must be angry.
I'm supposed to be
gone far away.

01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:15.200
I guess it seems sort of
irresponsible, my being here.

01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:21.300
And I was gonna leave.
Honest, I was.

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:23.300
But then I started thinking...

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:26.200
if I stuck around,
that would not be good for you.

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:29.000
Then I started
thinking that--

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:31.500
that might not
be bad for me.

01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:37.500
You didn't see
the play you gave me.

01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:39.900
I mean, what am I gonna do?

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.800
If I leave, I got nothing.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.600
No money, no friends, nothing.

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:47.900
If I stay, I got you.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.400
Anyone finds out I'm alive,
you're dead, so...

01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:56.700
I got-- I got you, Tommy.

01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:02.600
What's the matter?
You got nothing
to crack wise about?

01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:05.100
Bernie ain't
so funny anymore?

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:11.200
I guess I made kind of
a fool of myself out there...

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:16.000
bawling away like a twist.

01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:18.500
I guess--

01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:20.500
I guess I turned yellow.

01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:24.300
- You didn't tell anyone
about that?
- No.

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.500
Of course,
you know about it.

01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:32.700
It's a painful memory...

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:39.300
and I can't help remembering
that you put the finger on me,

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:42.500
and you took me out there
to whack me.

01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:46.200
I know... you didn't.
I know.

01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:50.100
- You didn't shoot me, but--
- But what have I done
for you lately?

01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:52.300
Don't smart me.

01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:56.200
See, I want
to watch you squirm.

01:13:57.900 --> 01:14:00.300
I want to see you
sweat a little.

01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:04.300
And when you smart me...

01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:08.200
it ruins it.

01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:20.500
There's one other thing I want.

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:25.200
I want to seeJohnny Caspar
cold and stiff.

01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:28.600
That's what you'll do
for your friend Bernie.

01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:35.000
In the meantime,
I'll stay out of sight.

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:38.500
But if Caspar ain't stiff
in a couple of days...

01:14:38.700 --> 01:14:40.700
I start eating
in restaurants.

01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:56.800
Oof!.

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:03.500
Uuh!

01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:05.700
You make me laugh, Tommy.

01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:09.300
You're gonna catch cold.
Then you're no good to me.

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:12.200
What were you gonna do
if you caught me?

01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:15.800
I'd just squirt a few,
and then you'd let me go again.

01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:26.100
Hello, Tad.
How's the club holding up?

01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:29.800
We're managing to squeak by
without you.
Got Lazarre's money?

01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:33.100
- No.
- You're not supposed to be here
since you turned rat.

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:35.700
Relax, Tad.
Leo isn't around, is he?

01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:39.800
Last couple of days you booked
any heavy bets on a long shot
at Saturday's fights?

01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:42.100
Why the hell
should I tell you?

01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:45.900
The truth is, Tad,
no reason on Earth.

01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:50.600
Saturday's fights?

01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:54.500
DropJohnson put two grand
on one yesterday--

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:58.100
on Sailor Reese,
an undercard bum.

01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:01.200
DropJohnson.
He play your book much?

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:04.600
- Are you kidding? I didn't
even know he could count.

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:06.900
Jesus. You bring them with you?

01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:10.400
Hello, Brian.
Still fighting the good fight?

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:12.800
Hello, Tom.
Neither rain nor wind nor snow.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
That's the mailman. O'Doole here?

01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:24.300
Hello, O'Doole.
You don't look happy.

01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:26.500
Look at this mess.

01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:29.900
Guttin' the golden calf again.
I don't know whether to laugh or cry.

01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:33.700
Yeah, it's awful confusing.
You know a yegg
named DropJohnson?

01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:36.500
- We spanked him
a couple of times.
- Where does he flop?

01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:38.800
- Terminal Hotel, Bay Street.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:43.200
Jesus!
Look, don't nobody ask me since
I'm just the chief around here,

01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:45.500
but I'll tell you my opinion.

01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:49.800
Caspar is just as crazy as Leo,
and an "eye-tie"
into the bargain.

01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:53.100
What's the matter, O'Doole?
Doesn't anything ever suit you?

01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:06.000
Hop in, Tom.
We been lookin'for you.

01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:08.600
- I'm busy.
- Hop in anyway.

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:11.900
You can't hijack me, Tic-Tac.
We're on the same side now.

01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:14.800
Or didn't you get
that far in school?

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:26.000
How'd you get the fat lip?

01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:30.400
- Old war wound.
Acts up around morons.
- Very smart.

01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:33.600
What were you doing
at the club, talking
things over with Leo?

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:36.600
Don't think so hard, Eddie.
You might sprain something.

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:39.400
You are so goddamn smart.

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:41.400
Except you ain't.

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:44.400
I get you, smart guy.
I know what you are.

01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:46.500
Straight as a corkscrew.

01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:48.500
Mr. Inside Out-ski,

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:52.600
like some goddamn Bolshevik
picking up his orders
from Yegg Central.

01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:54.900
You think you're
so goddamn smart.

01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:57.200
You join upJohnny Caspar,

01:17:57.300 --> 01:17:59.300
you bump Bernie Bernbaum.

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:03.900
Up is down. Black is white.

01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:08.300
Well, I think you're half smart.

01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:10.900
I think you were straight
with your frail,

01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:13.600
I think you were queer
with Johnny Caspar...

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:17.800
and I think you'd sooner
join a ladies' league
than gun a guy down.

01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:22.300
Then I hear from these
two geniuses they never even
saw this rub-out take place.

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:26.200
- Boss said to have him do it.
He didn't say nothing about--
- Shut up!

01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:29.600
Or maybe you still got
too many teeth.

01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:36.300
Everyone is so goddamn smart.

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:40.200
Well, we'll go out
to Miller's Crossing...

01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:43.200
and we'll see who's smart.

01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:11.600
You understand if we don't
find a stiff out here,
we leave a fresh one.

01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:31.500
Where are your friends
when you need 'em, huh?

01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:35.200
Where's Leo now?

01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:39.600
Hey, Tic-Tac!

01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:43.500
You ever notice how
the snappy dialogue dries up...

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:46.100
once a guy starts
soiling his union suit?

01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:34.200
Okay. There's nothing out here.

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:52.000
- Think about this... smart guy.

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:55.000
It's hanky time.

01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:03.100
- Birds have been at him.

01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:05.700
Jesus Christ.

01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:34.300
Told you
to put one in his brain,
not in his stinkin' face!

01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:42.000
I told you, Dane.
We heard two shots.

01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:11.700
Hello, Drop.

01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:17.800
How are the Katzenjammers?

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.600
Hello, Tom. What's the rumpus?

01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:24.200
Had any visitors?

01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:26.400
Uhh, no.

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:28.400
Not ever, Drop?

01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:30.400
Not lately.

01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:33.000
Then you must be happy to see me.

01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:38.200
So, uh...

01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:42.100
you didn't see Bernie Bernbaum
before he was shown across.

01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:44.200
Uh, no.

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:46.300
Seen him since?

01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:50.800
One last question, Drop.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:55.400
You got a lot of money
on tomorrow's fight.

01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:59.600
That your bet, or, uh...
you placing it for a friend?

01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:01.700
No, no, no, it's my bet.

01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:06.300
- I just have a good feeling
about that fight.
- A good feeling, huh?

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:09.100
When did a feeling
return to your head?

01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:11.800
You've outgrown that one.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.100
Must be all the thinking
you been doing.

01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:17.200
Tell Bernie something's come up,
he has to get in touch.

01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:20.400
There'll be nothing stirring
till I talk to him.

01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:57.800
All right, anyone left in there,
come on out grabbing air.
You know the drill.

01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:16.500
Aah!

01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:02.200
Hello, Tom.
Where you been hiding?

01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:04.600
Hither and yon.
Is the mayor in?

01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:07.100
- He's with Mr. Caspar.
- That's who I'm looking for.

01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:10.400
- Scare me up some gargle, will you?
- Sure. I'll announce you.

01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:13.200
Don't bother. I'm well-liked.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.000
I can't do it.
I'll look ridiculous.
It simply isn't done.

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:21.100
-Assistants, maybe.
- For a mayor, you don't hear so hot.

01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:24.200
I said head.
Head of the assessor's office.

01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:28.400
- But there are two of them.
- I can count. Co-heads.

01:25:28.700 --> 01:25:31.600
Johnny, needless to say,
this office will do
anything in its power...

01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:34.300
to assist you and your cousins.

01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:36.000
We did it for Leo, of course,
on countless occasions.

01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:38.100
We did it for Leo, of course,
on countless occasions.

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:42.000
Damn right.
Had every potato-eater from
County Cork on the public tit.

01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:44.500
But there's a way we do things,

01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:47.700
hallowed by usage
and consecrated by time.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:52.900
- When we put people on the pad
when Leo was running things--
- Leo ain't runnin' things!

01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:57.400
I ain't interested
in ancient history!
I'm runnin'things now!

01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:00.000
Nobody can appreciate it
more than I.

01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:02.400
I can give them jobs.
I can give them good jobs.

01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:05.600
I can even give them jobs
where they won't have
to perform any work,

01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:08.500
where their lack of English
will be no impediment, but I can't--

01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:10.800
What is this, the high hat?

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Tom, can you explain it to him?
I can put them in public works,
but I can't--

01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:18.100
You can do whatever
the hell Caspar tells you.

01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:20.700
I don't remember
all this double talk
when Leo gave you an order.

01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:24.900
- Tom.Jesus!
- Stop whimpering
and do as you're told.

01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:28.300
- You can start
by gettin'out of here.
-Johnny, it's my office.

01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:33.200
Get out of here!
Take it on the heel and toe
before I whack you one!

01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:38.000
- You two beat it.

01:26:38.100 --> 01:26:42.100
-
- Yeah, go and keep
the mayor company.

01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:45.300
I'll take care
of ya's later.

01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:57.700
- Runnin' things--
it ain't all gravy.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.900
- What's the fireworks?
-Knocking over one of Leo's clubs.

01:27:02.100 --> 01:27:05.100
Son of a bitch
won't go belly up.

01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:08.400
I'm sorry, kid.
I heard about your
little ride this morning.

01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:10.400
Yeah, well,
sorry don't fix things.

01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:14.300
We could just as easily
have missed Bernie's corpse,
and I'd be dead now.

01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:18.000
I know, I know, but that don't mean
the Dane's up to anything.

01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:22.000
So he hears a rumor
that Bernie ain't dead.
These stories pop up.

01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:25.300
Any stories
about Bernie being alive
the Dane's made up himself.

01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:29.200
You don't know that.
It don't make sense. Why would he?

01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:31.800
There could be
a damn good reason...

01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:36.300
if you got
a fixed fight coming up.

01:27:38.700 --> 01:27:41.700
- Do you?
- Maybe.

01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:47.400
Okay, yeah, sure.
Tomorrow night.
The fix is in. What of it?

01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:49.800
- The Dane know about it?
- Yeah.

01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:56.200
Okay, I get it.

01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:59.200
If the Dane's been selling
you out on these fights
and means to again,

01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:02.400
- he's gonna have to have somebody
else to point the finger at.
- Yeah, I get it.

01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:04.900
With Bernie dead,
there ain't a hell of a lot
of people he can point to.

01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:08.700
Yeah, the Dane sells me out,
makes pretend Bernie's still
doing it.

01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:10.800
That's real pretty.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.900
Bernie leaked the fix,
and you take the fall
for not killing him.

01:28:17.100 --> 01:28:21.400
But I don't know.
Why would Eddie cross me
like that? Money?

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:23.800
Okay, everybody likes money,

01:28:23.900 --> 01:28:27.000
but somehow it just
don't seem like him.

01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:31.500
- And I know the Dane.
- Nobody knows anybody.
Not that well.

01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:34.400
Money don't mean
that much to him.

01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:36.700
Then it's not just
the money he's after.

01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:40.500
- He's got a wart on his fanny.
- Huh?

01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:44.200
A wart on his fanny
giving him the fidgets.

01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:46.700
Maybe he's sick of sitting
on the couch.

01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:50.000
Maybe behind your desk
don't look like a bad place to move to.

01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:52.500
Kid, you got a lip on you.

01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:56.100
But you're honest.

01:28:56.300 --> 01:28:59.800
That's something we can't
get enough of in this business.

01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:06.800
I'll admit since last we jawed...

01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:09.400
my stomach's
been seizing up on me.

01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:12.400
If the Dane's saying
we should double-cross you--

01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:16.600
You double-cross once,
where's it all end?

01:29:16.900 --> 01:29:19.600
An interesting ethical question.

01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:28.200
I'll find the Dane,
talk to him,
straighten things out.

01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:31.800
- Sure, talk to him.
Have a chat.
- I'll take care of it.

01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:34.900
- Ask him if he's selling you out.
I'm sure he'll come clean.
- I'll take care of it.

01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:38.500
- You're swimmin' in it.
- I said I'd take care of it!

01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:51.600
-Johnny.

01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:55.900
My chin's hanging out
right alongside yours.

01:29:57.800 --> 01:30:01.100
I'd worry a lot less if
I thought you were worrying enough.

01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:07.500
But I am, kid.

01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:13.100
Christ.

01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:16.800
Running things.

01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:29.500
- Yeah?
I got your message.

01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:32.700
Oh, Bernie. I had a dream
about you the other day.

01:30:32.900 --> 01:30:36.200
- Yeah? A nightmare?
- On the contrary. Very sweet.

01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:39.600
I dreamt you were
lying out at Miller's Crossing
with your face blown off.

01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:43.100
You get a kick out of that?
- I was in stitches.

01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:46.100
- It's Mink, isn't it?
- I came back.
He wasn't happy to see me.

01:30:46.300 --> 01:30:48.100
- Can you beat that?
- Some friend.

01:30:48.300 --> 01:30:50.200
Yeah. You know what
a nervous boy he was.

01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:53.900
I figured you're a friend,
maybe you could use
some insurance.

01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:56.100
Did Mink have a .22?

01:30:58.300 --> 01:31:01.200
-He already ditched it. Why?
- After he shot Rug?

01:31:01.300 --> 01:31:04.400
- Yeah. How'd you know?
- Doesn't matter.

01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:09.100
- I've been thinking about
our deal. You can stick it
in your ear.  - Huh?

01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:12.600
You don't have anything
on me that I don't have on you,
so I'm calling your bluff.

01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:15.100
- Wait a minute.
- I'm pulling out
tomorrow morning.

01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:18.700
You only have to decide
whether or not I leave behind
a message for Caspar...

01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:20.700
that you're still around.

01:31:20.900 --> 01:31:23.200
If you want me to keep
my mouth shut, it's gonna
cost you some dough.

01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:25.900
I figure a thousand bucks
is reasonable, so I want two.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.100
- In a pig's eye!
- I'm going out. I'll be back
at 4:00 this morning.

01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:32.200
If you're not here at my place,
4:00, with the dough,

01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:35.600
- Caspar's gonna be
looking for you tomorrow.
- Wait, wait, wait!

01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:46.800
- Got any money?
- No.

01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:50.600
Okay.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.900
Third race tonight.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.700
By the finish, Tailor Made
had a view of the field.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.300
You oughta lay off
the ponies, Tom.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.800
Okay.

01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:31.600
Lazarre said he's sorry about this.
It's just getting out of hand.

01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:33.700
Yeah.

01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:35.700
He likes you, Tom.

01:32:35.900 --> 01:32:38.300
He said we didn't have to
break anything.

01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:41.300
It's okay.

01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:43.900
Tell him there's
no hard feelings. Heh!

01:32:44.100 --> 01:32:48.100
Christ, Tom...
he knows that.

01:32:50.900 --> 01:32:53.000
Take care now.

01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:09.300
- Tom Reagan.
- Yes, sir.

01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:12.900
- Mr. Caspar's in the great room.
- Swell. Can you hold these?

01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:16.500
Kid, what's the rumpus?

01:33:16.700 --> 01:33:18.500
I got news.

01:33:18.700 --> 01:33:21.700
Yeah. News at this end too.

01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:24.300
My stomach's been
seizing up on me.

01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:27.000
- Mink just told me that he--
- Eh?

01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:30.600
- You talked to Mink?
- Yeah, on the phone.

01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:33.800
The Dane wants you to think
that he's disappeared
so you can't talk to him,

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.900
- but he's been here in town.
- You sure it was Mink?

01:33:37.100 --> 01:33:40.800
Yeah. See for yourself.
He's coming to my place,
4:00 this morning.

01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:44.700
He's afraid of
a crossing with Dane.
He told me about the fix.

01:33:44.900 --> 01:33:48.100
He says he'll sing for
a couple of grand skip money,
tell us everyone involved.

01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:50.700
But you'd better take care
of the Dane tonight.

01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:53.600
Mink says he's
coming after us tonight.

01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:02.200
Leo's holed up
at Whiskey Nick's dump.

01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:04.300
What? How do you know?

01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:07.300
That ain't all we know, smart guy.

01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:11.700
Recognize your playmate?

01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:18.600
You thought I'd quit, huh? Uh-uh.

01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:21.600
I followed you
this afternoon,

01:34:21.900 --> 01:34:25.400
and I wondered why Einstein
would wanna talk to a gorilla.

01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:28.900
So I grabbed the gorilla,
and I beat it out of him.

01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:32.600
You give me a big guy
every time. They break easy.
Not like you.

01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:36.100
Is there a point,
or are you just brushing up
on your small talk?

01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:39.700
I like that.
Cool under fire.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:42.900
I'm impressed.

01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:48.100
The gorilla didn't know
whose stiff we found,
but I can fill that in.

01:34:48.300 --> 01:34:51.200
You killed Mink,
you son of a bitch!

01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:55.800
It was Mink,
you son of a bitch.

01:34:56.100 --> 01:35:00.700
It was Mink, and by God,
I'll hear you say it.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.300
Is this how you told Drop
his story?

01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:07.900
Come here, bum.

01:35:11.700 --> 01:35:14.800
I am gonna send you
to a deep, dark place,

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.700
and I am gonna have fun doing it.

01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:36.100
Oof!.

01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:41.300
You son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch!
You lousy son of a bitch!

01:35:41.700 --> 01:35:45.300
If there's one thing
I can't stand,
it's a double-cross artist!

01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:50.800
I had a theory
about this son of a bitch!

01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:59.900
Shut up, you lousy
son of a bitch, or I'll give you
something to holler about!

01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:03.200
Johnny, it's okay.
The Dane made him do it.
It's not important.

01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:06.900
Then make him shut it!

01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:10.800
And we do the same to Mink
this very same night!

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.800
We can't double-cross Mink.
He wants to spill the whole setup.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.500
- I've never let
a son of a bitch walk.
- You've never crossed anyone.

01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:21.000
4:00, my place. Mink's
coming in on his own hook,
so I promised him the money.

01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:26.400
- Don't make me out
to be a liar.

01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:31.500
Look at this, kid.

01:36:33.300 --> 01:36:36.100
Something I try to teach
all my boys.

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:48.600
Always put one in the brain.

01:37:10.700 --> 01:37:12.500
What's the rumpus?

01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:16.100
I was just in the neighborhood
feeling a little daffy.

01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:18.600
- What are you doing?
- Walking.

01:37:18.700 --> 01:37:20.900
Don't let on more
than you have to.

01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:22.900
In the rain.

01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:29.500
Bernie's dead, isn't he?

01:37:30.900 --> 01:37:33.900
- What makes you think that?
- That's no answer.

01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:41.300
I can't tell you
anything yet.

01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:44.300
No one really cares, do they?

01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:49.400
- His friends
didn't really like him.
- He didn't like his friends.

01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:52.700
You're someone to talk.
You're a son of a bitch, Tom.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.800
You got me
to tell you where he was,
and then you killed him.

01:37:57.100 --> 01:37:59.100
I want to know why.

01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:02.900
- What was in it for you?
- Nothing for me.

01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:11.100
Giving up Bernie was
the only way I could see to
straighten things out for Leo.

01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:16.000
I thought you said
you didn't care about Leo.

01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:19.700
I said we were through.
It's not the same thing.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.400
I don't understand.
I don't care.

01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:25.800
I don't care what reasons you had
or you thought you had.

01:38:25.900 --> 01:38:28.400
He's still alive.

01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:32.600
You expect me to believe you?

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.900
No.

01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:46.200
That's you all over, Tom.

01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:48.800
A lie and no heart.

01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:08.600
Oh--

01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:18.200
It isn't easy, is it, Verna?

01:39:33.900 --> 01:39:37.700
But before
you even think about doing
that, you gotta towel down.

01:39:37.900 --> 01:39:43.200
So you towel down first
with a hot towel,
as hot as you can stand.

01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:45.900
Put the razor
in cold water, not hot,

01:39:46.100 --> 01:39:48.700
because metal
does what in cold?

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:53.200
- I don't know,Johnny.
- That's why I'm telling you!
It contracts.

01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:59.200
That way you get
a first-class shave every time.

01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:01.400
Okay,Johnny.

01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:06.100
Ain't it the life though?

01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:13.200
Hello, Sal. You can dangle.

01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:18.100
Hello, Tom. You sure?
You don't look so hot.

01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:20.100
I'm okay.

01:40:22.900 --> 01:40:25.000
I'll drive him home.

01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:20.300
Mr. Reagan, there were shots.

01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:23.300
Go down to the drug store
and call the police.

01:41:25.100 --> 01:41:27.900
You'd better stay there
till the officers arrive.

01:41:29.100 --> 01:41:31.100
Will my cats be all right?

01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:33.200
Yeah, they'll be fine.

01:42:25.100 --> 01:42:28.000
I get it. You set me up.

01:42:28.100 --> 01:42:31.000
Anything to avoid
a little dirty work yourself, huh?

01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:36.400
How'd you know he'd get it
and not me? Or didn't you care?

01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:39.100
I figured you'd come early
looking for blood.

01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:42.100
He wouldn't, so you'd likely
have the drop on him.

01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:47.900
You're right.
The chump never knew what hit him.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:51.400
But if you knew
I'd come to kill you,
how do you know I won't still?

01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:54.500
There's nothing in it
for you now.

01:42:54.700 --> 01:42:57.500
With him dead, you and me
got nothing on each other.

01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:01.000
- Let me have the gun.
- Why?

01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:03.600
Pin this on the Dane.

01:43:03.700 --> 01:43:06.600
Neither of us want him
walking around after this.

01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:10.400
The cops'll be Leo's now.
They won't care what
they hang the Dane for.

01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:12.500
I guess that's true,

01:43:12.700 --> 01:43:16.900
if you don't mind keeping
the gun that killed Caspar
and Mink.

01:43:18.100 --> 01:43:20.400
Why did Mink
shoot Rug anyway?

01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:22.500
I don't know.
It was just a mix-up.

01:43:22.700 --> 01:43:25.000
Here.

01:43:27.900 --> 01:43:31.500
- So you're gonna say
the Dane did this?
- Sure.

01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:34.400
Mink thought Rug
was tailing him.

01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:37.100
You know Mink. Hysterical.
Skin full of hop,
head full of boogeymen.

01:43:37.300 --> 01:43:41.600
Comes home crying one day,
saying he had to pop
one of the Dane's spies.

01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:45.300
Rug was tailing Verna,
not Mink. Mink just
happened to be with her.

01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:47.400
Funny, ain't it?

01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:50.600
Mink was terrified
the Dane'd find out me and him
were jungled up together.

01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:53.700
I bet you kept him
worried about that to
keep him under your thumb.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.300
Yeah, so what?
Scratch, huh?

01:43:56.500 --> 01:43:59.000
A little bonus.

01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:02.400
- Why did Mink take Rug's hair?
- Beats me. The kid was dizzy.

01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:06.600
Fifty-fifty on the dough?
Or maybe I should get more,
since I did the deed.

01:44:09.300 --> 01:44:12.000
Okay, you keep it.
I want you to have it.

01:44:18.900 --> 01:44:23.500
Bernie... we can't pin this
on the Dane.

01:44:23.700 --> 01:44:29.300
- Why not?
- Because the Dane's already
dead halfway across town.

01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:32.700
- What the hell
are you talking about?
- Eddie Dane is dead.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.800
It's gotta be you.

01:44:36.500 --> 01:44:38.800
I mean, it was your gun.

01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:45.200
What is this?
What the hell are you talking about?

01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:47.800
You--

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:51.400
You took my gun.
It's just your word against mine.

01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:57.000
Not necessarily.

01:44:58.100 --> 01:45:00.200
Are you crazy?

01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:03.600
We're square.
You said it yourself.
We got nothing on each other.

01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:06.100
Yep.

01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:10.500
So what's in it for you?
There's no angle.

01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:13.500
You can't just shoot me
like that.

01:45:17.100 --> 01:45:20.500
Jesus Christ,
it don't make sense.

01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:24.700
Tommy--

01:45:26.700 --> 01:45:29.200
Tommy!

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:32.900
Look in your heart.

01:45:35.500 --> 01:45:38.100
- Look in your heart.
- What heart?

01:46:23.300 --> 01:46:25.300
Tad? It's Tom.

01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:29.700
Tell Lazarre
I got his money.

01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:31.800
Yeah, all of it.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.800
I wanna place a bet
on tonight's fight.

01:46:39.900 --> 01:46:41.700
- They set you up downstairs?
- How's that?

01:46:41.900 --> 01:46:44.000
A little hooch, whatever?

01:46:44.100 --> 01:46:46.900
Thanks for coming, Tom.
Leo's real anxious to see you.

01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:49.100
Yeah, I happened to be near.

01:46:51.500 --> 01:46:54.600
Well, uh, actually this might
not be the best time.

01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:57.600
- Who's he got in there?
- O'Doole and the mayor.

01:46:57.800 --> 01:47:02.300
- I'll try again.
- They're planting the sheeny
tomorrow. You could stop by.

01:47:31.700 --> 01:47:35.200
- Big turnout.
- Drop dead.

01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:37.400
She's under a lot of strain.

01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:41.000
- Yeah, well, at least
she didn't hit me.

01:47:41.100 --> 01:47:44.400
Glad you came, Tommy.

01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:48.300
- I guess, uh-- Huh?
- She's taking the car.

01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:56.100
- I guess we're walkin'.
- Guess we are.

01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:03.300
We're, uh--
We're getting married.

01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:08.600
Congratulations.

01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:13.800
Funny thing is, she asked me to
tie the knot. I guess you're
not supposed to say that.

01:48:14.100 --> 01:48:16.800
- It doesn't matter.
Congratulations.
- Thanks.

01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:21.200
Hell, Tom, why didn't you
tell me what you were up to?

01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:23.700
I thought you'd
really gone over.

01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:27.300
Not that I didn't deserve it,
but you could've told me.

01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:30.900
Telling you would only
have queered things if it--

01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:34.000
There just wasn't any point.

01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:36.000
I can see that.

01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:40.500
It was a smart play all around.

01:48:40.700 --> 01:48:43.600
I guess you know I'm grateful.

01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:45.700
No need.

01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:50.200
Heh!
I guess you picked
that fight with me...

01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:53.700
just to check yourself
in with Caspar.

01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:57.500
I don't know.
Do you always know
why you do things, Leo?

01:48:57.800 --> 01:48:59.600
Sure I do.

01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:04.500
- It was a smart play.
- Fine.

01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:11.200
Jesus, Tom, I'd do anything
if you'd work for me again.

01:49:11.500 --> 01:49:14.700
I know I've made
some bonehead plays,
I know I can be pigheaded,

01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:17.300
but, damn it, so can you.

01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:21.800
I need you.
Things can be the way they were.

01:49:22.100 --> 01:49:24.300
I know it.
I just know it.

01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:28.800
As for you and Verna,
well, I understand.

01:49:29.100 --> 01:49:31.800
You're both young.

01:49:31.900 --> 01:49:34.100
Damn it, Tom, I forgive you.

01:49:34.300 --> 01:49:36.600
I didn't ask for that,
and I don't want it.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:44.900
Good-bye, Leo.
