00:09.677 --> 00:10.478
Hi.

00:10.578 --> 00:12.280
Hey.

00:12.380 --> 00:13.947
I got you the milk you needed.

00:14.048 --> 00:15.015
What do I owe you?

00:15.116 --> 00:16.284
Forget it.

00:16.384 --> 00:19.820
No, you bought me juice
and bread yesterday.

00:19.920 --> 00:22.056
Now I may be losing my
job, but I can still afford

00:22.156 --> 00:23.657
to pay for a carton of milk.

00:23.757 --> 00:24.892
- Roseanne.
- What do I owe you?

00:24.992 --> 00:25.793
OK.

00:25.893 --> 00:27.661
It's $1.40.

00:27.761 --> 00:31.465
OK, let's see--

00:31.565 --> 00:36.937
$0.50, $0.75, $0.80--

00:37.037 --> 00:39.173
OK, I'll give you the rest
when I do the laundry.

00:39.273 --> 00:41.875
Wonderful.

00:41.975 --> 00:44.712
So did you find something
for Mom for Mother's Day?

00:44.812 --> 00:45.779
No.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.982
Why don't we just
send her some perfume?

00:49.083 --> 00:51.619
She'll think we don't
like the way she smells.

00:51.719 --> 00:54.488
I don't like the
way she smells.

00:54.588 --> 00:56.757
How about flowers?

00:56.857 --> 00:58.559
Why don't you just
her house stinks too?

01:01.229 --> 01:02.130
How about candy?

01:02.230 --> 01:03.030
No.

01:03.131 --> 01:04.598
We gave her candy two years ago.

01:04.698 --> 01:05.533
Remember?

01:05.633 --> 01:07.101
Thanks for the candy, girls.

01:07.201 --> 01:08.502
I could have
swallowed my filling,

01:08.602 --> 01:12.072
but luckily it stuck
right in the caramel.

01:12.173 --> 01:14.542
How about a crystal vase?

01:14.642 --> 01:16.844
Can't afford that.

01:16.944 --> 01:19.613
Hey, what about if we break
a glass and put it in a box

01:19.713 --> 01:20.514
marked fragile?

01:24.152 --> 01:25.419
Oh, I know what.

01:25.519 --> 01:27.821
Let's get her something that
makes her feel really young.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.191
What, like a wagon?

01:30.291 --> 01:32.893
You're not helping.

01:32.993 --> 01:37.498
Hey, I think I
found my Mother's

01:37.598 --> 01:39.600
Day present from the kids.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.034
You're not going
to open it, are you?

01:41.135 --> 01:41.935
Yeah.

01:42.035 --> 01:43.271
It's two days away!

01:43.371 --> 01:44.872
Well, I need time to practice
pretending like I like it.

01:48.676 --> 01:49.543
Oh, man.

01:49.643 --> 01:52.846
I should have opened
it a week ago.

02:43.531 --> 02:44.332

02:44.432 --> 02:45.833
When?

02:45.933 --> 02:46.867
Oh, great!

02:46.967 --> 02:47.768
Yes!

02:47.868 --> 02:49.537
OK, OK, cool.

02:49.637 --> 02:51.104
Bye.

02:51.205 --> 02:52.406
Dana did it!

02:52.506 --> 02:54.542
She got the concert tickets,
Des Moines next Saturday.

02:54.642 --> 02:55.943
Awesome!

02:56.043 --> 02:57.611
We're going to meet Marcy and
Lisa at Dana's, and then we're

02:57.711 --> 02:59.580
going to pick everybody
else up in the van.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.415
Oh, this is going
to be so great.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.950
Yes, as long as
we all understand

03:03.050 --> 03:06.254
that you and Stacy won't be
sitting with me and my friends.

03:06.354 --> 03:07.288
Becky?

03:07.388 --> 03:09.290
There's going to be
20,000 people there.

03:09.390 --> 03:13.561
Why would we sit next
to the only four geeks?

03:13.661 --> 03:16.497
OK, we're going away for
the weekend without an adult.

03:16.597 --> 03:20.200
The big R is definitely going
to have a problem with that.

03:20.301 --> 03:21.569
Well, not if we tell
her the right way.

03:21.669 --> 03:23.837
I mean, we just gotta
make it sound good.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.773
How?

03:25.873 --> 03:26.740
I don't know.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.843
Tell her we're
never coming back.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.279
DAN: Hey.

03:31.379 --> 03:32.246
Hey.

03:32.346 --> 03:33.814
How was your day?

03:33.914 --> 03:36.850
Would you like to
know what your son did?

03:36.950 --> 03:40.220
Well, if he's my son,
it must be something bad.

03:40.321 --> 03:42.956
Well, I had to go to school
to see his teacher because it

03:43.056 --> 03:46.794
seems like he hasn't turned
in any of his math homework

03:46.894 --> 03:48.195
for the past two weeks.

03:48.296 --> 03:49.096
I see.

03:49.196 --> 03:51.098
And how did he explain this?

03:51.198 --> 03:53.967
Well, he's had a lot of
extra responsibility around

03:54.067 --> 03:55.035
here since you died.

04:01.975 --> 04:05.413
- Did I suffer?
- No.

04:05.513 --> 04:06.380
Sniper.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.281
Clean shot.

04:09.950 --> 04:12.152
I said I was sorry.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.787
Ever since he got
that video game,

04:13.887 --> 04:15.122
he's just been goofing off.

04:15.222 --> 04:16.324
All right, Deej.

04:16.424 --> 04:18.326
From now on, you finish
your homework first thing

04:18.426 --> 04:19.393
when you come home from school.

04:19.493 --> 04:20.528
Do you read me?

04:20.628 --> 04:23.030
Yes.

04:23.130 --> 04:26.266
Is that it?

04:26.367 --> 04:28.001
Oh, and you cannot
lie to your teachers.

04:28.101 --> 04:28.902
You got it?

04:30.804 --> 04:31.605
OK.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.273
OK.

04:33.374 --> 04:36.009
No, it is not OK.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.211
You're going to watch any
TV this whole weekend.

04:38.312 --> 04:39.413
You understand that?

04:39.513 --> 04:40.848
And you're not playing
any of those video games,

04:40.948 --> 04:42.450
either, til your teacher
calls me and tells me

04:42.550 --> 04:43.917
that you're caught up.

04:44.017 --> 04:44.818
Dad!

04:44.918 --> 04:46.520
You heard your mother.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.322
Now take your homework
upstairs and wash up

04:48.422 --> 04:50.190
for dinner.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.493
I hate you!

04:52.593 --> 04:53.961
Then my work here is done.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.932
[slapping can]

04:59.533 --> 05:00.334
What?

05:00.434 --> 05:02.102
Hey, thanks for
your help there.

05:02.202 --> 05:03.003
What?

05:03.103 --> 05:04.071
I backed you up.

05:04.171 --> 05:06.340
Why do I always have
to be the bad guy?

05:06.440 --> 05:07.875
Hey, I told him he
had to do his homework

05:07.975 --> 05:09.209
and to stop lying
to his teachers.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.178
What else do you want from me?

05:11.278 --> 05:12.813
How about if you
punish him once?

05:12.913 --> 05:16.216
How about if you end up
where he doesn't like you?

05:16.316 --> 05:17.851
Give him time.

05:17.951 --> 05:18.786
He'll turn on me.

05:18.886 --> 05:19.720
He's a Conner boy.

05:22.423 --> 05:24.157
Six or seven years from
now, we'll be slugging

05:24.257 --> 05:26.494
it out on the front lawn.

05:26.594 --> 05:30.964
That doesn't do me any
good now, does it, Dan?

05:31.064 --> 05:31.865
We'll ask later.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.105
[music playing]

05:38.205 --> 05:39.540
D.J., be quiet!

05:39.640 --> 05:40.841
You're going to wake up Mom!

05:40.941 --> 05:43.010
I don't care!

05:43.110 --> 05:44.244
It's Mother's Day, you moron.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.979
Stop trying to tick her off.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.515
Yeah, go upstairs,
hose off whatever

05:47.615 --> 05:51.018
stupid thing you made for her
in school and bring it down.

05:51.118 --> 05:51.985
Or what?

05:52.085 --> 05:52.986
Or we'll bury
you under the porch

05:53.086 --> 05:53.987
with the rest of our brothers.

05:58.659 --> 05:59.560
Hi.

05:59.660 --> 06:00.528
DARLENE: Hey.

06:00.628 --> 06:03.664
I only had five
eggs in my fridge.

06:03.764 --> 06:06.366
Well, how long
have they been there?

06:06.467 --> 06:08.268
Uh, well--

06:08.368 --> 06:10.838
I know I bought them
on my way to work.

06:10.938 --> 06:14.708
I just don't remember which job.

06:14.808 --> 06:15.743
[telephone ringing]

06:15.843 --> 06:16.977
Oh man, who'd be
calling this early?

06:17.077 --> 06:18.245
Well, get it before
it wakes up Mom!

06:18.345 --> 06:20.681
I got it.

06:20.781 --> 06:22.082
Hello?

06:22.182 --> 06:24.818
Oh, hi, Mom.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.186
No, this is Jackie.

06:26.286 --> 06:28.589
Happy Mother's Day.

06:28.689 --> 06:29.790
Yeah.

06:29.890 --> 06:33.093
Yeah, it's a shame you
can't say the same to me.

06:33.193 --> 06:37.030
Uh, so-- Did you
get the slippers?

06:37.130 --> 06:39.700
Unique good or unique bad?

06:39.800 --> 06:41.401
Do you think we should
ask Dad about the concert?

06:41.502 --> 06:43.236
I mean, maybe he
can soften Mom up.

06:43.336 --> 06:45.105
I don't think he'd
go for it either.

06:45.205 --> 06:47.407
Besides, she's still mad
about the whole D.J. thing.

06:47.508 --> 06:50.410
I think we should just
stick to our plan.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.345
Mom, don't you think that
if I was dating somebody,

06:52.446 --> 06:55.849
I would tell you about it
just to get you off my back?

06:55.949 --> 06:57.384
Oh, really.

06:57.485 --> 07:00.988
Well, go suck an egg.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.557
Huh?
No.

07:03.657 --> 07:05.258
I did not.

07:05.358 --> 07:06.226
No!

07:06.326 --> 07:07.828
Why would I say
something like that?

07:07.928 --> 07:08.962
Suck an egg?

07:09.062 --> 07:11.465
I don't-- I don't even
know what that means.

07:11.565 --> 07:12.500
I'm telling you.

07:12.600 --> 07:13.667
I didn't say that.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.268
Must be a bad connection.

07:15.368 --> 07:16.470
So Mom, listen.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.305
Happy Mother's Day, and
I'll tell Roseanne to give

07:18.405 --> 07:19.807
you a call when she gets up.

07:19.907 --> 07:21.174
OK?
Uh huh.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.075
Bite me.

07:25.679 --> 07:26.714
Oh, man.

07:26.814 --> 07:29.817
I should have thought
of that a long time ago.

07:29.917 --> 07:30.718
Here she comes.

07:30.818 --> 07:31.685
Tell her how great she looks.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.990
Well, it's your
father's way of telling

07:37.090 --> 07:40.127
me how much he loves me.

07:40.227 --> 07:41.629
You said you liked it.

07:41.729 --> 07:44.297
I love it, because
I know that you

07:44.397 --> 07:47.100
picked it out all by yourself.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.869
Oh my, my, my!

07:48.969 --> 07:49.970
Let me feel--

07:50.070 --> 07:51.939
Oh, boy!

07:52.039 --> 07:57.611
That feels fire retardant.

07:57.711 --> 07:58.779
It's way retardant.

08:02.015 --> 08:02.950
She hates it.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.317
Do something.

08:04.417 --> 08:05.686
Sit down, Mom.

08:05.786 --> 08:06.954
There's your coffee and juice.

08:07.054 --> 08:08.455
French toast is coming up.

08:08.556 --> 08:10.457
What, did you
actually make breakfast?

08:10.558 --> 08:11.358
Well, sure!

08:11.458 --> 08:13.994
It's Mother's Day.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.729
What's the catch?

08:15.829 --> 08:16.630
No catch.

08:16.730 --> 08:18.699
Can't we just do something nice?

08:18.799 --> 08:21.434
I don't know, you never have.

08:21.535 --> 08:22.603
Here, happy Mother's Day.

08:22.703 --> 08:23.804
Oh, look it!

08:23.904 --> 08:27.407
It's an ash tray with your
picture at the bottom.

08:27.507 --> 08:28.709
Oh, it's a shame
you quit smoking.

08:28.809 --> 08:30.210
You could grind your
butts out on his face.

08:33.413 --> 08:35.215
Shut up!

08:35.315 --> 08:37.184
Well, I like it,
D.J., and I'm going

08:37.284 --> 08:38.952
to use it for a candy dish.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.588
You really, really love it?

08:40.688 --> 08:42.289
I love it, yes!

08:42.389 --> 08:44.457
And you're still
not watching any TV.

08:44.558 --> 08:46.894
Gee!

08:46.994 --> 08:47.795
Here, Mom.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.763
This is from me and Darlene.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.532
Oh, thanks.

08:52.633 --> 08:53.634
Oh, look at that!

08:53.734 --> 08:55.903
It's a gift certificate
to the Beauty Box!

08:56.003 --> 08:56.804
Oh man!

08:56.904 --> 08:58.138
Mother's Day make over.

08:58.238 --> 09:01.842
Manicure, pedicure, facial,
complete hair styling!

09:01.942 --> 09:05.879
Man, this must
have cost a lot.

09:05.979 --> 09:09.282
Which one of you's is pregnant?

09:09.382 --> 09:10.784
Mother, we just wanted
to get you something

09:10.884 --> 09:12.720
we thought you'd really like.

09:12.820 --> 09:14.855
Yeah, I mean, I know I've been
kind of a nightmare this year,

09:14.955 --> 09:17.958
so it's just my way of saying
thanks for putting up with me.

09:18.058 --> 09:21.629
Ah, well that is so sweet!

09:21.729 --> 09:22.996
Thank you.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.832
That's so nice!

09:24.932 --> 09:25.866
Look at, Dan!

09:25.966 --> 09:28.335
The girls got me a good gift!

09:31.238 --> 09:32.039
Way to go.

09:34.808 --> 09:36.576
And you know what would
just make it perfect?

09:36.677 --> 09:39.579
We all go together.

09:39.680 --> 09:40.480
Oh, no.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.783
That's just for you.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.384
No, I want you
two to go with me.

09:44.484 --> 09:45.585
It would be great!

09:45.686 --> 09:47.220
But it's your day.

09:47.320 --> 09:50.758
And I want to spend
it with my two girls.

09:50.858 --> 09:52.459
Really?

09:52.559 --> 09:55.963
Shoot, we only have
enough money for you, Mom.

09:56.063 --> 09:56.997
Oh, don't worry about it.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.999
I got plenty money.

09:59.099 --> 10:02.502
How much did you
pay for this robe?

10:02.602 --> 10:04.972
[music playing]

10:10.978 --> 10:14.047
Oh, I think I
overdid it today.

10:14.147 --> 10:17.317
The girls made me breakfast,
then they took me out to lunch.

10:17.417 --> 10:19.086
Then I felt like we
really should lose some

10:19.186 --> 10:21.088
of those calories, so
we left the car parked

10:21.188 --> 10:22.956
in front of the
restaurant, then we walked

10:23.056 --> 10:25.358
over to Baskin and Robbins.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.194
Sounds like you had
a great Mother's Day.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.261
Oh, yeah.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.063
It's just great.

10:30.163 --> 10:34.101
Me and my girls hanging
out together, acting crazy.

10:34.201 --> 10:36.069
Oh, we went to this
movie theater, you know,

10:36.169 --> 10:39.072
but we'd already seen the
show, so we stood out in front

10:39.172 --> 10:42.075
and told everybody the ending.

10:42.175 --> 10:46.814
Oh, it just doesn't get
any better than that.

10:46.914 --> 10:49.082
Mrs. Conner, it's
time for your shampoo.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.251
Oh, do I really have to move?

10:51.351 --> 10:52.786
Sorry.

10:52.886 --> 10:53.687
Oh, all right.

10:56.556 --> 11:01.428
Boy, what we girls won't go
through to be beautiful, huh?

11:01.528 --> 11:06.566
Oh yeah, Mom, you betcha.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.501
Oh man, this stuff
is sucking my brain

11:08.601 --> 11:10.704
out right through my face.

11:10.804 --> 11:12.840
Just hang in.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.407
She better let us
go to that concert.

11:14.507 --> 11:15.809
She will.

11:15.909 --> 11:16.910
Ask her now.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.278
No, wait til
they've done her hair

11:18.378 --> 11:20.247
and she's got a buzz
going from the spray.

11:24.251 --> 11:26.119
[music playing]

11:30.557 --> 11:31.624
No TV.

11:31.725 --> 11:34.027
I just came to
show you my homework!

11:34.127 --> 11:34.962
Did you finish it?

11:35.062 --> 11:37.197
Yeah.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.099
- Long division.
- It's stupid.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.367
I'll never need it.

11:40.467 --> 11:41.601
I have a calculator.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.636
Now wait a minute, Deej.

11:43.737 --> 11:45.672
What if your batteries go dead?

11:45.773 --> 11:47.440
I'll buy new ones.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.910
OK, say you're on
a deserted island

11:50.010 --> 11:53.747
and there's no battery store
and you got to split 300

11:53.847 --> 11:55.548
coconuts between seven people.

11:55.648 --> 11:56.449
Dad.

11:56.549 --> 11:57.717
It's your choice, Deej.

11:57.818 --> 11:59.853
You can grow up to be
Gilligan or the Professor.

12:05.993 --> 12:07.928
So what do I do now?

12:08.028 --> 12:09.462
It's a beautiful day outside.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.298
Go play.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.866
Can I watch TV?

12:12.966 --> 12:13.801
No.

12:13.901 --> 12:14.701
OK.

12:19.206 --> 12:20.407
You wanna come with me?

12:20.507 --> 12:21.308
Uh, yeah.

12:21.408 --> 12:24.244
Maybe after the game.

12:24.344 --> 12:25.145
OK.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.517
Deej, wait a minute.

12:30.617 --> 12:31.751
You're right.

12:31.852 --> 12:33.753
Let's go do something.

12:33.854 --> 12:35.188
- What about the game?
- Forget the game.

12:35.288 --> 12:36.356
What do you want to do?

12:36.456 --> 12:37.257
Watch TV.

12:37.357 --> 12:38.158
No!

12:38.258 --> 12:39.426
Come on, man.

12:39.526 --> 12:41.328
We're two guys on the
loose, wild and free.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.296
There's a whole big
world out there!

12:43.396 --> 12:44.898
Let's go wherever
the wind blows us!

12:47.734 --> 12:50.770
Let me get my bowling shoes.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.772
[music playing]

12:58.378 --> 13:00.747
End of the line.

13:00.848 --> 13:02.749
This was so cool, Dad.

13:02.850 --> 13:05.118
Yeah, didn't I tell
you there was more things

13:05.218 --> 13:07.320
in the world than video games?

13:07.420 --> 13:10.057
Yeah, you can
stop saying that.

13:10.157 --> 13:11.892
Here, give me your helmet.

13:11.992 --> 13:14.661
But I wanted to bash
some stuff with my head!

13:14.761 --> 13:16.864
It's a $200 helmet.
Take it off first.

13:20.300 --> 13:24.471
Give me a hand wiping all
the mud off of this beast.

13:24.571 --> 13:27.240
OK.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.109
Big day for you, Deej.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.511
You learned how to shoot
pool, you bowled your weight.

13:35.082 --> 13:36.683
Found out you got to
spit sideways when

13:36.783 --> 13:37.885
you're riding on a motorcycle.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.655
Sure beats TV, huh?

13:42.755 --> 13:44.057
A little.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.592
So tell me about
this Allison girl

13:45.692 --> 13:47.527
that was hanging around
you at the bowling alley.

13:47.627 --> 13:48.896
I hate her.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.530
Sounds serious.

13:50.630 --> 13:51.999
No way!

13:52.099 --> 13:53.033
She's always bugging me.

13:53.133 --> 13:55.869
Keeps trying to kiss me.

13:55.969 --> 13:58.605
Just like me when
I was your age.

13:58.705 --> 14:02.209
Girls were drawn to me like
moths to a porch light.

14:02.309 --> 14:04.311
You've got the
Conner curse, son.

14:04.411 --> 14:06.813
So what do I do?

14:06.914 --> 14:07.714
Nothing.

14:07.814 --> 14:08.615
It goes away.

14:11.318 --> 14:14.054
[music playing]

14:17.490 --> 14:21.361
Well, Mrs. Conner,
what do you think?

14:21.461 --> 14:23.296
Oh, I'm beautiful.

14:23.396 --> 14:26.266
I no longer have to think.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.035
You look great, Ma.

14:28.135 --> 14:31.004
Yeah, like our big sister
just got back from college.

14:31.104 --> 14:34.107
Well, you guys
look gorgeous too!

14:34.207 --> 14:35.608
We're going to have
to go get a picture

14:35.708 --> 14:37.444
so we can remember this!

14:37.544 --> 14:38.345
Oh, no.

14:38.445 --> 14:41.314
We'll remember.

14:41.414 --> 14:42.715
I think we should
go over to Woolworth's

14:42.815 --> 14:46.353
and try to smash all of our hair
into one of those photo booths.

14:46.453 --> 14:49.622
It could be a little romantic
evening in your future.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.959
Dad's going to go
crazy when he sees you.

14:52.059 --> 14:52.859
Are you kidding?

14:52.960 --> 14:53.760
Look at me.

14:53.860 --> 14:56.563
I can do way better than him.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.231
Mom, when's the
last time, you know,

14:58.331 --> 15:01.134
you spent some time alone
with Dad, just the two of you?

15:01.234 --> 15:04.104
Well, Darlene, we really can't
afford to go away right now,

15:04.204 --> 15:05.038
you know.

15:05.138 --> 15:06.273
I know.

15:06.373 --> 15:07.840
But I mean, maybe you could
spend a weekend at home,

15:07.941 --> 15:09.542
and we could go away.

15:09.642 --> 15:12.379
I mean, D.J. could spend the
night at a friend's house,

15:12.479 --> 15:16.783
and Becky and I could
take off for the weekend.

15:16.883 --> 15:18.318
Take off where?

15:18.418 --> 15:19.452
I don't know.

15:19.552 --> 15:22.489
There's this concert in
Des Moines coming up.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.091
So you want to go to
a concert in Des Moines

15:24.191 --> 15:25.625
to stay for the whole weekend?

15:25.725 --> 15:29.029
Yeah, that way, you'd have
the whole house to yourselves.

15:29.129 --> 15:30.563
Where would you stay?

15:30.663 --> 15:32.665
We'd get a motel
room or something.

15:32.765 --> 15:33.666
No.

15:33.766 --> 15:34.867
Why?

15:34.968 --> 15:37.137
Because no!

15:37.237 --> 15:39.506
Now, if you really care about
me and Dad having a weekend

15:39.606 --> 15:41.074
alone, then why don't
you take D.J. up

15:41.174 --> 15:42.875
and go visit your grandma?

15:42.976 --> 15:45.745
I'm sure she'd be
really happy to see ya.

15:45.845 --> 15:48.615
Oh, come on.

15:48.715 --> 15:50.483
No, you guys are
way too young to go

15:50.583 --> 15:54.054
that long without an adult.

15:54.154 --> 15:55.388
This worked out
great, didn't it?

15:55.488 --> 15:56.289
Tell me about it.

16:02.862 --> 16:03.796
What does that mean?

16:03.896 --> 16:04.697
Worked out?

16:07.600 --> 16:08.401
Nothing.

16:08.501 --> 16:09.302
Forget it.

16:12.205 --> 16:13.606
Oh, this whole thing
was just some scam

16:13.706 --> 16:15.975
so you can go to some
stupid concert, right?

16:16.076 --> 16:17.477
Damn it.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.046
Mom--

16:19.146 --> 16:20.180
I'm going to pay the bill.

16:20.280 --> 16:24.084
You girls get dressed
and meet me in the car.

16:24.184 --> 16:25.985
[music playing]

16:32.792 --> 16:34.127
Come on, keep
stirring it, Deej.

16:34.227 --> 16:36.429
My arm is tired.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.998
Well, if you don't keep
stirring it, it won't be chili.

16:39.099 --> 16:40.267
I don't even like chili!

16:40.367 --> 16:42.869
You like science, don't you?

16:42.969 --> 16:43.803
Chili is science.

16:43.903 --> 16:44.704
How?

16:44.804 --> 16:46.339
Well, it's chemistry, son.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.475
See, chili represents your
three states of matter.

16:48.575 --> 16:51.010
Solid, liquid, and
eventually gas.

16:54.914 --> 16:58.351
Oh my God, it's the Shirelles.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.887
Who?

17:00.987 --> 17:04.324
- Disco.
- Well, Beck.

17:04.424 --> 17:05.825
Did you guys have a good time?

17:05.925 --> 17:07.260
Just swell.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.862
I'm going to go wash
this crap off my face.

17:09.962 --> 17:10.997
See, Deej.

17:11.098 --> 17:12.899
The good looking ones
always have an attitude.

17:15.935 --> 17:17.304
Hey.

17:17.404 --> 17:18.305
Ooh.

17:18.405 --> 17:19.806
Flashback.

17:19.906 --> 17:23.243
Prom night, 1969.

17:23.343 --> 17:25.645
And honey, even after
all these years,

17:25.745 --> 17:27.080
your hair is still just as wide.

17:29.749 --> 17:30.683
Don't touch it, Dan.

17:30.783 --> 17:33.420
You'll dent it.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.122
I did my homework!

17:35.222 --> 17:36.789
You did?

17:36.889 --> 17:41.794
Oh, you know you sure can
be a good kid some time.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.431
Something wrong, Roseanne?

17:44.531 --> 17:48.168
No, everything's fine.

17:48.268 --> 17:49.769
Deej, I want to talk
to your mom for a minute.

17:49.869 --> 17:51.404
Go bug your sisters.

17:51.504 --> 17:52.372
Use real bugs.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.876
Becky and Darlene
are in a mood.

17:56.976 --> 17:57.777
What's going on?

18:01.614 --> 18:03.583
Ah, quality time's for saps.

18:10.290 --> 18:12.091
You know, that whole
thing was just a set up.

18:12.192 --> 18:16.663
And they were just trying
to get something out of me.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.131
Why do they have
to do that today?

18:23.002 --> 18:24.103
It was still
really uncool of her.

18:24.204 --> 18:25.538
I mean, we spent the
whole day together

18:25.638 --> 18:27.540
and she treats us
like we're infants.

18:27.640 --> 18:28.541
[knocking]
DAN: You in there?

18:28.641 --> 18:29.442
Yeah.

18:29.542 --> 18:30.510
DAN: Come on out.

18:30.610 --> 18:31.911
Soon as we wipe off
these clown faces--

18:32.011 --> 18:32.812
DAN: Now.

18:39.552 --> 18:40.653
Yeah?

18:40.753 --> 18:42.989
First of all, let's just
say that you going away

18:43.089 --> 18:45.458
for a weekend to a rock concert
with the nearest adult five

18:45.558 --> 18:47.860
hours away, that was
never going to happen,

18:47.960 --> 18:49.629
no matter how you sucked up.

18:49.729 --> 18:50.697
Well, it's unanimous.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.799
I guess that
about wraps it up.

18:52.899 --> 18:54.701
I don't think so.

18:54.801 --> 18:58.538
OK, we'll apologize to her
before she, like, explodes.

18:58.638 --> 18:59.972
She's not going
to, like, explode.

19:00.072 --> 19:03.876
She's too busy
crying her eyes out.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.845
I'm the one you
got to worry about.

19:05.945 --> 19:09.416
Cuz I'm very angry, and I don't
like you very much right now.

19:09.516 --> 19:11.050
So now we're also supposed
to apologize to you?

19:11.150 --> 19:13.820
Shut up.

19:13.920 --> 19:16.088
So I don't have to say it again
in a minute, you shut up too.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.796
You guys just don't get it.

19:23.896 --> 19:26.032
You see, she thought
you were actually going

19:26.132 --> 19:27.834
to do something nice for her.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.969
You know, like you cared?

19:30.069 --> 19:31.671
And it would have been
the very best thing you

19:31.771 --> 19:33.806
could have done for her today.

19:33.906 --> 19:34.807
But you just ruined it.

19:37.444 --> 19:38.511
What should we do?

19:38.611 --> 19:40.980
You're going to
make it up to her.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.249
All right, we'll
think of something.

19:42.349 --> 19:43.082
No.
No.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.017
You had your chance.

19:45.117 --> 19:45.918
Now it's my turn.

19:56.062 --> 19:57.564
Stop.

19:57.664 --> 19:59.432
We're going out to dinner.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.268
No, I don't want to
eat with those girls.

20:01.368 --> 20:03.903
I just want to have
dinner and go to bed.

20:04.003 --> 20:05.905
They're not coming.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.974
I'm punishing them.

20:08.074 --> 20:09.276
Woah.

20:09.376 --> 20:10.477
Yes.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.879
And having to eat my chili
is just the beginning.

20:12.979 --> 20:14.547
Come on, we'll decide the
rest of their punishment

20:14.647 --> 20:15.448
over dinner.

20:15.548 --> 20:16.749
Let's get changed.

20:16.849 --> 20:17.884
But they hate me, right?

20:17.984 --> 20:18.785
No, no.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.019
That's the beauty part.

20:20.119 --> 20:21.554
They hate me.

20:21.654 --> 20:22.455
Oh, Dan!

20:22.555 --> 20:24.624
That's just great.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.158
Happy Mother's Day.

20:26.259 --> 20:27.226
Oh, man.

20:27.327 --> 20:31.531
This is so much better
than some old row.

20:31.631 --> 20:35.001

20:38.070 --> 20:39.972
[phone ringing]

20:42.542 --> 20:44.944
Hello?

20:45.044 --> 20:46.846
Yeah, hi Bev.

20:46.946 --> 20:47.747
Oh, good.

20:47.847 --> 20:48.648
Rosie?

20:48.748 --> 20:49.782
The kids got to your mother's.

20:49.882 --> 20:51.951
They're fine.

20:52.051 --> 20:53.185
ROSEANNE: Great.

20:53.286 --> 20:54.621
Oh, no.
You're welcome.

20:54.721 --> 20:56.022
They wanted to come.

20:56.122 --> 21:00.026
Hey, they're old enough to take
a weekend trip by themselves.

21:00.126 --> 21:02.295
What's that noise?

21:02.395 --> 21:07.467
Oh, what a treat for the girls
to meet your garden club!

21:07.567 --> 21:10.403
Does anyone there
play the piano?

21:10.503 --> 21:11.304
Great.

21:11.404 --> 21:14.974
Darlene loves to
sing show tunes!

21:15.074 --> 21:16.443
No, she's just being modest.

21:16.543 --> 21:17.344
Make her.

21:19.479 --> 21:22.349
Did you get your
projector fixed?

21:22.449 --> 21:23.683
Grand.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.552
What's a weekend at
grandma's without all

21:25.652 --> 21:28.721
those wonderful vacation slides?

21:28.821 --> 21:30.357
Yeah, no.

21:30.457 --> 21:32.158
We're just going to have
a little romantic weekend

21:32.258 --> 21:33.059
at home.

21:36.162 --> 21:39.366
All righty, well you
enjoy your grandchildren!

21:39.466 --> 21:40.266
OK!

21:40.367 --> 21:42.068
Bite me!

21:42.168 --> 21:45.405
