03:14.000 --> 03:15.147
Hey!

03:15.668 --> 03:18.379
What the—Who's that?

03:19.213 --> 03:20.360
You're dead.

03:20.465 --> 03:23.593
- Who grabbed me? Who grabbed me?
- Watch out!

03:24.114 --> 03:25.157
Who grabbed me?

03:27.659 --> 03:30.266
- Honey, you're gonna be late.
- What'd you grab me for?

03:31.517 --> 03:34.020
Mom, I can't find
my shoes for school.

03:34.124 --> 03:35.792
They're under the couch.

03:36.418 --> 03:37.773
Sit down. Yeah.

03:37.982 --> 03:39.963
Dad, will you sign my permission slip
for tomorrow?

03:40.067 --> 03:41.527
Give it to your mother.

03:41.944 --> 03:43.821
Your mother's arms are full.

03:44.655 --> 03:46.949
- You got time for pancakes?
- Nope.

03:47.158 --> 03:48.409
Give us another one, Dad.

03:50.286 --> 03:51.537
Secretary of Defense.

03:51.850 --> 03:52.788
Dean Rusk.

03:52.892 --> 03:55.603
Wrong. And you get
to wax my car.

03:55.708 --> 03:58.523
Rusk is State, moron.
It's Robert McNamara.

03:59.044 --> 04:00.296
Attorney General.

04:00.400 --> 04:01.234
Too easy.

04:01.338 --> 04:03.319
Yeah, it's Bobby Kennedy.

04:05.405 --> 04:09.784
All right, wise guys.
Assistant Secretary of State
for Latin America.

04:09.888 --> 04:11.452
That's too hard.

04:11.557 --> 04:14.580
Wait a minute.
This isn't a permission slip.

04:17.396 --> 04:18.750
This is your report card.

04:20.315 --> 04:22.088
Have you seen these grades?

04:22.401 --> 04:23.443
No.

04:25.007 --> 04:26.780
All right.
Gotta go. Be good.

04:30.429 --> 04:31.576
You—

04:32.098 --> 04:33.662
I'm talking to you later.

07:17.260 --> 07:19.137
- Morning, Evelyn.
- Hi, Ken.

07:20.805 --> 07:23.933
- Ooh, those candies are for the kids.
- Is that right?

07:43.327 --> 07:45.934
- Morning, Floyd.
- Good morning, Mr. O'Donnell.

07:59.072 --> 08:00.636
- Morning, Jackie.
- Hi, Kenny.

08:00.740 --> 08:02.409
- Want a schedule?
- No.

08:02.513 --> 08:05.641
Why'd you cross
all my people off the list?

08:05.745 --> 08:08.352
Because you don't have anybody
on it who means anything.

08:08.665 --> 08:11.376
- No votes there. There's no money.
- It's a party, Kenny.

08:11.376 --> 08:15.129
And the one thing we both can be
sure of is that you don't know
how to have a party.

08:15.547 --> 08:17.736
Well, party to you,
politics to me.

08:19.300 --> 08:21.907
So, who do you want?
For real?

08:22.011 --> 08:23.471
Everyone on my list.

08:23.680 --> 08:25.139
I don't want to spend
an entire evening

08:25.244 --> 08:28.580
pretending that your votes and
money are more interesting
than they really are.

08:29.102 --> 08:31.500
And I want my kids
to stop eating the candy
in the Oval Office.

08:31.604 --> 08:32.855
That's not me.

08:32.855 --> 08:34.211
Then who is it?

08:34.628 --> 08:35.879
I don't rat
on my friends.

08:36.400 --> 08:40.049
Well, I'm going to take
this whole list thing
up with your friend.

08:40.363 --> 08:41.927
Are you trying
to go around me?

08:42.030 --> 08:45.680
Go around you,
over you, through you—
Whatever it takes.

08:46.514 --> 08:48.078
You're starting to bug me.

08:48.287 --> 08:49.434
Good.

08:49.955 --> 08:50.998
I'll get back to you.

08:56.524 --> 08:58.401
Top of the morning,
Mr. President.

08:58.610 --> 08:59.757
Morning, Kenny.

09:00.487 --> 09:02.468
Just ran into your wife.

09:02.676 --> 09:05.283
- Want to talk about this party?
- No.

09:06.221 --> 09:10.601
- You see Homer Capehart's
tirade today?
- I did.

09:10.809 --> 09:12.269
I don't see why he needs
to invent an issue.

09:12.269 --> 09:14.250
He's got his election
sewn up.

09:14.771 --> 09:16.753
Even so, we should
still go out for Bobby.

09:16.857 --> 09:19.046
It's good groundwork
for us in '64.

09:19.776 --> 09:21.549
Look into that, uh...

09:22.904 --> 09:24.990
That Vietnam thing.

09:25.094 --> 09:27.179
- What, the 2 planes that went down?
- Yeah.

09:27.909 --> 09:29.995
It didn't make it
before press time.

09:30.099 --> 09:31.872
I haven't taken a look
at the West Coast papers yet,

09:31.976 --> 09:34.374
but I doubt we'll see
anything till tomorrow.

09:36.355 --> 09:37.294
I was eating that.

09:39.170 --> 09:40.317
- No, you weren't.
- I was.

09:41.464 --> 09:42.924
- No, you weren't.
- I was.

09:46.782 --> 09:48.138
I was, you bastard.

09:49.076 --> 09:50.744
So, what do we got today?

09:51.266 --> 09:51.996
Today.

10:03.152 --> 10:03.986
That's it.

10:04.195 --> 10:06.280
That's the one
we're looking for.

10:07.844 --> 10:10.138
- I need to see the President, Kenny.
- All right.

10:10.660 --> 10:14.309
2:30 to 2:45 or 4:30 to 5: 00.
Take your pick.

10:14.309 --> 10:15.873
No, I need to see him
now, Ken.

10:19.731 --> 10:21.504
You can go on up.
I'll let him know you're coming.

10:26.613 --> 10:27.447
Coffee?

10:28.177 --> 10:29.324
Yeah.

10:30.992 --> 10:32.452
That's not what you said.

10:32.556 --> 10:34.016
<i>What'd I say?
Tell me what I said.</i>

10:34.120 --> 10:35.580
That's not what—

10:35.684 --> 10:38.082
Listen to me, you
worthless piece of shit.

10:38.187 --> 10:40.272
Now, you will put
Daley's man on the circuit,

10:40.376 --> 10:42.149
and you'll do it today.

10:42.566 --> 10:45.486
You owe your goddamn job
to this administration.

10:47.780 --> 10:50.908
Yeah, I can—I can hear
how grateful you are,

10:51.429 --> 10:52.784
but there's a word
you need to learn.

10:53.410 --> 10:55.183
It's the only word
in politics.

10:55.287 --> 10:57.998
It's called loyalty.
Loyalty!

10:59.249 --> 11:01.752
Now, any part of this
you don't understand?

11:02.899 --> 11:03.941
Good.

11:06.131 --> 11:07.278
What?

11:07.591 --> 11:09.780
This isn't the blessed order
of St. Mary the Meek.

11:10.614 --> 11:12.179
Look, you better
come in here.

11:13.847 --> 11:16.245
What was it you
were saying to me
the other day about Cuba?

11:16.454 --> 11:17.809
It wasn't important?

11:17.913 --> 11:19.269
Not as far
as the election goes.

11:19.373 --> 11:21.041
Mac, let's, uh...

11:21.146 --> 11:23.023
Can I see that for a second?

11:23.440 --> 11:25.734
Ken, you used to look down
a bombsight for a living.

11:25.838 --> 11:29.696
Just ignore the labels.
What does that look like to you?

11:34.596 --> 11:36.160
I don't know.

11:37.307 --> 11:38.246
What is it?

11:38.350 --> 11:40.748
On Sunday morning, one of
our U-2s took these pictures.

11:40.957 --> 11:43.981
The Soviets are putting medium-range
ballistic missiles into Cuba.

11:44.189 --> 11:47.422
They appear to be the SS-4,
range of 1000 miles,

11:47.526 --> 11:49.924
3-megaton nuclear warheads.

11:50.133 --> 11:52.322
Seen here in this year's
May Day Parade in Red Square.

11:58.057 --> 12:00.142
Jesus Christ in heaven.

12:02.853 --> 12:04.417
White House operator.

12:04.522 --> 12:07.754
Yeah, Mr. O'Donnell, please,
for Secretary McNamara.

12:08.275 --> 12:09.527
Go ahead, please.

12:11.091 --> 12:12.446
White House operator.

12:13.072 --> 12:15.574
I've got the President
for the Attorney General.
Go ahead, please.

12:15.678 --> 12:17.243
What the crap
is going on today?

12:17.347 --> 12:18.181
That's right. That's right.

12:18.285 --> 12:20.475
The principals
are assembling in an hour.

12:20.788 --> 12:22.143
We'll see you then.

12:22.456 --> 12:23.811
Where's Bobby?

12:24.020 --> 12:26.522
- He should be here any minute.
- Well, good.

12:31.215 --> 12:32.257
Good.

12:34.447 --> 12:36.011
Where the hell are you?

12:36.219 --> 12:37.471
We're in here.

12:40.807 --> 12:43.935
Jesus Christ, guys. What the hell
is Khrushchev thinking?

12:43.935 --> 12:46.751
You have any indication of this
from your KGB pal Bolshakov?

12:46.855 --> 12:48.940
Any possible warning,
sense of motivation?

12:49.045 --> 12:50.087
Complete snow job.

12:50.192 --> 12:51.651
And then we went out
and told the country

12:51.860 --> 12:53.841
they weren't putting
missiles into Cuba.

12:54.571 --> 12:55.926
Jesus, I...

12:56.656 --> 12:59.472
I feel like we caught the Jap carrier
steaming for Pearl Harbor.

13:22.619 --> 13:25.017
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, Mr. President.

13:25.122 --> 13:27.103
- Mr. Secretary.
- Mr. President.

13:27.416 --> 13:28.875
Bob, I'll bet you
had a late night.

13:29.084 --> 13:30.648
Sleep is for the weak,
Mr. President.

13:30.752 --> 13:32.212
- Max.
- Mr. President.

13:32.421 --> 13:34.089
The CIA's been notified.

13:34.610 --> 13:36.487
McCone's on his way back
from the West Coast.

13:36.591 --> 13:38.677
He's been burying
his stepson.

13:39.094 --> 13:41.075
General Carter
is here, though.

13:44.307 --> 13:46.393
- Ted.
- Kenny.

13:47.331 --> 13:47.957
OK.

13:51.606 --> 13:52.962
Let's have it.

13:53.692 --> 13:54.526
Arthur?

13:55.256 --> 13:57.028
Gentlemen,
as most of you now know,

13:57.132 --> 13:59.948
a U-2 over Cuba
Sunday morning

14:00.052 --> 14:02.033
took a series
of disturbing photographs.

14:02.554 --> 14:04.431
Our analysis at NPIC
indicates

14:04.536 --> 14:06.412
that the Soviet Union
has followed up

14:06.517 --> 14:09.540
its conventional weapons
buildup in Cuba

14:09.645 --> 14:12.356
with the introduction
of surface-to-surface

14:12.564 --> 14:16.631
medium-range
ballistic missiles, or MRBMs.

14:16.735 --> 14:18.716
Our official estimate
at this time

14:18.820 --> 14:22.678
is that this missile system
is the SS-4 Sandal.

14:23.095 --> 14:27.162
We do not believe that the missiles
are as yet operational.

14:27.370 --> 14:30.186
Ironbark reports
that the SS-4 can deliver

14:30.290 --> 14:33.835
a 3-megaton nuclear weapon
1000 miles.

14:33.939 --> 14:36.755
So far, we've identified
32 missiles

14:36.963 --> 14:39.257
serviced by about 3,400 men,

14:39.466 --> 14:42.177
undoubtedly
all Soviet personnel.

14:42.385 --> 14:44.262
Our cities
and military installations

14:44.471 --> 14:47.911
in the Southeast as far north
as Washington, D.C.

14:48.016 --> 14:50.205
Are in range of these weapons

14:50.414 --> 14:53.855
and in the event of a launch
would have only 5 minutes
of warning.

14:53.855 --> 14:55.106
5 minutes, gentlemen.

14:55.210 --> 14:59.068
In those 5 minutes, they
could kill 80 million Americans

14:59.694 --> 15:03.135
and destroy a significant
percentage of our bomber bases,

15:03.656 --> 15:05.950
degrading our
retaliatory options.

15:07.201 --> 15:09.078
The Joint Chiefs'
consensus, Mr. President,

15:09.182 --> 15:13.457
is that this signals
a major doctrinal shift
in Soviet thinking

15:13.875 --> 15:16.168
to a first-strike policy.

15:16.690 --> 15:19.818
It is a massively
destabilizing move.

15:20.339 --> 15:22.320
How long until
they're operational?

15:22.425 --> 15:24.823
General Taylor can answer
that question better than I can.

15:24.927 --> 15:27.847
GMAC—Guided Missiles
Intelligence Committee—

15:27.951 --> 15:30.349
estimates 10 to 14 days.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.790
A crash program
could limit that time,

15:33.894 --> 15:37.544
however, I must stress
that there may be more missiles

15:38.065 --> 15:39.629
that we don't know about.

15:40.359 --> 15:41.714
We need more U-2 coverage.

15:42.653 --> 15:44.217
Gentlemen,
I want first reactions here.

15:44.321 --> 15:47.449
Assuming for the moment
that Khrushchev has not
gone off the deep end

15:47.449 --> 15:50.473
and intends to start World War Ill,
what are we looking at?

15:50.577 --> 15:51.933
Well, Mr. President,

15:52.037 --> 15:54.435
I believe my team
is in agreement.

15:54.540 --> 15:56.521
If we permit the introduction
of nuclear missiles

15:56.625 --> 15:59.232
to a Soviet satellite nation
in our hemisphere,

15:59.753 --> 16:02.464
the diplomatic
consequences would be...

16:02.672 --> 16:04.758
too terrible to contemplate.

16:04.966 --> 16:06.113
The Russians are trying
to show the world

16:06.218 --> 16:07.782
they can do whatever they want,
wherever they want,

16:07.886 --> 16:10.493
and we're powerless to stop them.
If they succeed...

16:10.701 --> 16:12.370
It'll be Munich all over again.

16:12.682 --> 16:15.498
Yes. Appeasement only makes
the aggressor more aggressive.

16:16.436 --> 16:19.251
And the Soviets will be
emboldened to push us even harder.

16:19.356 --> 16:22.379
Now, we must remove the missiles
one way or another.

16:22.484 --> 16:24.048
Now, it seems to me
the options are either

16:24.048 --> 16:26.237
some combination of
international pressure

16:26.342 --> 16:29.574
and action on our part
till they give in,

16:29.678 --> 16:31.034
Or...

16:31.659 --> 16:33.223
We hit them—

16:33.328 --> 16:34.892
An air strike.

16:35.622 --> 16:36.664
Bob?

16:36.873 --> 16:39.375
We worked up
several military scenarios.

16:39.375 --> 16:42.191
Before I ask
General Taylor to take us
through the various options,

16:42.295 --> 16:44.484
I'd like for us to adopt a rule.

16:44.589 --> 16:46.466
If we decide to strike,

16:46.570 --> 16:48.447
we must agree now to do it

16:48.551 --> 16:51.262
before the missiles
become operational,

16:51.575 --> 16:54.599
because once they are,
I don't think we can
guarantee getting them all

16:54.703 --> 16:56.267
before at least—

16:56.684 --> 16:58.561
At least some of them
are launched.

17:00.542 --> 17:02.002
Well, it's clear
we cannot permit

17:02.106 --> 17:04.191
Soviet nuclear missiles
in Cuba.

17:10.656 --> 17:12.950
We have to get
those missiles out.

17:13.992 --> 17:17.121
You know, I don't think
it's going to matter what
Khrushchev's intentions are.

17:18.685 --> 17:20.145
I can tell you right now,

17:20.249 --> 17:22.438
I don't see any way
around hitting them.

17:22.751 --> 17:25.671
If we hit 'em,
kill a lot of Russians,
they'll move against Berlin.

17:25.983 --> 17:27.548
All right,
they attack Berlin,

17:27.548 --> 17:29.529
that's NATO, and we're at war.

17:29.633 --> 17:31.718
We're damned if we do,
but if we don't,

17:31.823 --> 17:34.221
we're in a war for sure
somewhere else in 6 months.

17:34.325 --> 17:36.306
Well, if there are
alternatives that make sense,

17:36.411 --> 17:37.975
and I'm not saying
that there are,

17:38.079 --> 17:39.434
then we need them,
and we need them fast.

17:39.539 --> 17:40.894
All right.
What about Congress?

17:40.998 --> 17:43.292
Now, I think we may need
to start letting key people know,

17:43.397 --> 17:45.690
and they're all scattered
across the country
for the campaign.

17:45.795 --> 17:46.837
We can get Congress back.

17:46.942 --> 17:49.027
We're gonna need to get the U.N.
Stomping and warmed up.

17:49.653 --> 17:50.695
What about the allies?

17:50.904 --> 17:52.155
We can't start worrying
about everything.

17:52.364 --> 17:53.823
Right now we got to
figure out what we're gonna do

17:53.928 --> 17:55.909
before we worry about
how we're gonna do it.

17:56.222 --> 17:57.681
We've got a bunch
of smart guys.

17:57.786 --> 17:59.975
We lock 'em in a room
and kick 'em in the ass

18:00.080 --> 18:02.165
until they come up
with some solutions.

18:04.876 --> 18:06.231
I'll do it.

18:08.942 --> 18:11.341
It's too politicized
with you in there anyway.

18:11.445 --> 18:13.113
They need to be able
to stick their necks out.

18:13.218 --> 18:14.782
Yeah. It'll be the principals,

18:14.886 --> 18:17.388
a couple of the key guys
from each Department—

18:17.701 --> 18:20.933
The Executive Committee
of the National Security Council.

18:21.351 --> 18:23.749
Call it EXCOM.

18:24.374 --> 18:25.521
OK.

18:25.730 --> 18:28.649
So, I'm only gonna
show for the meetings
that you call me into.

18:29.379 --> 18:30.735
And impress us.

18:31.152 --> 18:32.612
Do it fast.

18:33.341 --> 18:35.427
And, Kenny, you're
gonna be in charge
of keeping this thing quiet.

18:35.531 --> 18:38.242
I mean, if word gets out before
we know what we're gonna do,

18:38.346 --> 18:39.702
there's gonna be panic.

18:39.806 --> 18:41.579
And it's gonna ruin
any chance we might have

18:41.683 --> 18:43.456
at surprise if we decide
to hit them.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.958
We're gonna need to do
a few things right away.

18:46.479 --> 18:47.835
No Pierre.

18:47.939 --> 18:50.442
He knows, the press knows.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.840
And you're gonna have
to keep up your schedule.

18:53.048 --> 18:54.925
Your movements
are followed too closely.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.115
Well, George Ball's got
a conference room at State.

18:57.219 --> 18:59.409
Good. You meet over there
this afternoon.

18:59.513 --> 19:02.537
We'll figure out some way
to sneak you guys
back in here tonight.

19:02.745 --> 19:05.144
I think we should
bring in Dean Acheson.

19:06.916 --> 19:10.566
Kenny, he was fighting Soviets
while we were still playing
ball together at school.

19:13.172 --> 19:14.528
Find him, Kenny.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.864
We're gonna need
all the help we can get.

19:26.519 --> 19:27.874
Screw secrecy.

19:27.979 --> 19:31.211
You try having that fat ass
sit on your lap all the way
from Foggy Bottom.

19:31.419 --> 19:34.026
You were excited.
I say no more.

19:34.756 --> 19:37.050
Everybody agrees
the diplomatic route won't work.

19:37.050 --> 19:40.178
It's too slow, and they'll
have the missiles finished
while we're still talking.

19:41.012 --> 19:44.349
I hear old Warren Harding used to
get his girls in through here.

19:44.557 --> 19:46.538
We have 850 planes

19:46.643 --> 19:49.875
assembling at Homestead,
Eglin, Opa Locka,

19:49.979 --> 19:54.150
MacDill, Patrick,
Pensacola, and Key West.

19:54.567 --> 19:56.444
Due to
the tropical foliage,

19:56.444 --> 19:58.217
the OPLAN calls
for high explosive

19:58.321 --> 20:01.345
and napalm load-outs for
our ground-attack sorties.

20:01.449 --> 20:03.951
I still think there are
diplomatic approaches

20:04.160 --> 20:05.203
we haven't considered yet.

20:05.411 --> 20:07.497
Jesus, Adlai,
peace at any price?

20:07.705 --> 20:09.373
We have a gun to our head.

20:10.520 --> 20:11.667
We have high confidence

20:11.667 --> 20:14.587
in the expanded air-strike
option, Mr. President.

20:14.691 --> 20:18.028
The problem is, sir, is that
it's a short-term solution.

20:18.236 --> 20:21.052
Khrushchev can send in
more missiles next month.

20:21.260 --> 20:22.928
The Chiefs and I believe

20:23.033 --> 20:24.910
we should follow up
the air strikes

20:25.014 --> 20:27.203
with a full version
of OPLAN 316.

20:27.516 --> 20:29.289
- An invasion?
- Yes, sir.

20:29.602 --> 20:31.478
We can be sure
we get all the missiles,

20:31.583 --> 20:34.815
and we remove Castro
so this can never happen again.

20:34.919 --> 20:37.005
Is this the Joint Chiefs'
recommendation?

20:37.213 --> 20:40.654
Yes, sir. Our best option,
as Bob pointed out this morning,

20:40.654 --> 20:44.616
would be to commence the strikes
before the missiles
become operational.

20:45.138 --> 20:47.640
The invasion happens 8 days later.

20:50.038 --> 20:51.394
Dean...

20:52.749 --> 20:53.896
What do you think?

20:54.626 --> 20:56.816
Gentlemen,
for the last 15 years,

20:56.920 --> 20:58.588
I've fought here at this table

20:58.693 --> 21:00.257
alongside your predecessors

21:00.674 --> 21:02.864
in the struggle
against the Soviet.

21:02.968 --> 21:05.366
Now, I do not wish
to seem melodramatic,

21:05.470 --> 21:07.347
but I do wish
to impress upon you

21:07.556 --> 21:10.997
a lesson I learned with
bitter tears and great sacrifice.

21:11.205 --> 21:13.812
The Soviet understands
only one language—Action.

21:14.333 --> 21:17.565
Respects only
one word—Force.

21:17.878 --> 21:19.964
I concur with General Taylor.

21:20.068 --> 21:22.570
I recommend, sir, air strikes
followed by invasion,

21:23.509 --> 21:27.158
perhaps preceded by an ultimatum
to dismantle the missiles

21:27.158 --> 21:28.931
if that is militarily viable.

21:29.035 --> 21:31.433
So, it appears
we have 3 options.

21:31.746 --> 21:34.457
Number one—
A surgical air strike

21:34.457 --> 21:36.230
against the missiles themselves.

21:36.334 --> 21:40.088
2—A much larger air strike
against their air defenses

21:40.713 --> 21:43.007
along with the missiles,
and 3—

21:44.050 --> 21:45.093
Invasion.

21:45.197 --> 21:47.699
So, we're certainly
gonna do number one.

21:47.804 --> 21:49.680
We're gonna take
these missiles out.

21:49.785 --> 21:51.870
It seems to me
we can't wait very long.

21:51.974 --> 21:54.060
We should at least be
making those preparations.

21:54.060 --> 21:56.771
We're preparing to
implement all 3 options,

21:56.875 --> 21:58.230
though I must stress again, sir,

21:58.335 --> 21:59.899
there are risks to the strikes

22:00.420 --> 22:01.880
without the follow-on
invasion.

22:01.880 --> 22:03.131
You want to be clear,
Mr. President,

22:03.235 --> 22:05.634
that we've definitely decided
against a political track.

22:08.970 --> 22:10.430
Dean, uh...

22:11.577 --> 22:15.018
How does this all play out?

22:15.122 --> 22:16.686
Your first step, sir,
will be to demand

22:16.895 --> 22:20.544
that the Soviet
withdraw the missiles
within 12 to 24 hours.

22:21.065 --> 22:22.525
They will refuse.

22:22.629 --> 22:25.549
When they do,
you will order the strikes,
followed by the invasion.

22:26.070 --> 22:28.781
They will resist and be overrun.

22:28.886 --> 22:31.180
They will retaliate
against another target

22:31.284 --> 22:33.682
somewhere else in the world,
most likely Berlin.

22:34.308 --> 22:36.497
We will honor
our treaty commitments

22:36.602 --> 22:38.270
and resist them there,

22:38.583 --> 22:40.564
defeating them per our plans.

22:42.441 --> 22:44.526
Those plans call for
the use of nuclear weapons.

22:50.782 --> 22:54.119
So what is the...
What is the next step?

22:54.432 --> 22:56.308
Hopefully, cooler heads
will prevail

22:56.413 --> 22:58.498
before we reach the next step.

23:03.399 --> 23:04.546
Thank you, gentlemen.

23:19.560 --> 23:21.124
What happened in there?

23:21.854 --> 23:23.418
I thought he was gonna
give us his decision.

23:23.523 --> 23:25.608
Look, I know them. They just need
to make sure there's no other way.

23:25.817 --> 23:26.651
They'll get there.

23:26.859 --> 23:29.362
Remember that Kennedy's father
was one of the architects of Munich.

23:29.466 --> 23:31.864
There's only one
responsible choice here,

23:31.968 --> 23:34.262
so let's hope appeasement
doesn't run in families.

23:34.575 --> 23:36.452
I fear weakness does.

23:57.202 --> 23:58.870
Jesus Christ.

24:03.562 --> 24:04.709
Call—Call me Irish,

24:04.813 --> 24:07.211
but I don't believe
in cooler heads prevailing.

24:07.316 --> 24:09.922
- You know, they think
I froze in there.
- You didn't freeze.

24:10.027 --> 24:12.633
You did exactly
what you should've done.
You stayed out of the corner.

24:12.738 --> 24:13.676
You didn't decide.

24:13.780 --> 24:16.179
Well, Acheson's
scenario is just—

24:16.387 --> 24:18.473
It's unacceptable, and he's got
more experience than any of them.

24:18.473 --> 24:20.141
There is no expert
on the subject.

24:20.245 --> 24:22.956
I mean, there is no
wise old man. There's—

24:23.373 --> 24:25.250
Shit. There's just us.

24:26.084 --> 24:28.274
The thing is
that Acheson's right.

24:28.378 --> 24:30.046
Talk alone is not gonna
accomplish anything.

24:32.549 --> 24:33.904
Well, let's bomb
the shit out of 'em.

24:34.843 --> 24:37.762
Everybody wants to.
I mean, even you.

24:37.867 --> 24:39.431
I mean, even me.

24:40.161 --> 24:42.350
Right? It sure would
feel good.

24:42.559 --> 24:43.914
And, Jack,

24:44.227 --> 24:46.521
I'm as conniving
as they come, but

24:46.938 --> 24:48.711
a sneak attack is just wrong.

24:48.815 --> 24:51.109
Things are happening too fast.
I mean, this is starting to smell

24:51.213 --> 24:52.881
like the Bay of Pigs
all over again.

24:52.986 --> 24:55.801
Well, tonight, listening
to Taylor and Acheson,

24:56.531 --> 24:59.138
I kept seeing Lemnitzer
and Dulles telling me

24:59.242 --> 25:01.223
all I had to do was
sign on the dotted line,

25:01.327 --> 25:03.934
and the invasion would
succeed, and Castro—

25:04.768 --> 25:06.958
And Castro would be gone.

25:07.166 --> 25:09.981
Just—easy—
Just like that.

25:15.925 --> 25:16.863
You know, there's something...

25:19.261 --> 25:21.764
immoral about abandoning
your own judgment.

25:25.518 --> 25:27.290
We just can't let this
get out of hand.

25:28.646 --> 25:30.418
And we're gonna do
whatever we have to do

25:30.523 --> 25:31.982
and make this come out right.

25:36.362 --> 25:38.760
- I'm gonna stay here tomorrow.
- No, you can't.

25:38.864 --> 25:41.158
Remember, we talked about this,
your schedule.

25:41.367 --> 25:44.182
The best thing you can do
tomorrow is go to Connecticut.

25:45.016 --> 25:46.059
He's right.

25:49.500 --> 25:50.751
Yeah.

25:51.272 --> 25:52.732
Jesus.

26:08.477 --> 26:10.875
Doesn't anybody in Connecticut
have to work today?

26:11.396 --> 26:13.899
I love you, JFK!

26:21.927 --> 26:23.700
The full spectrum
of air strikes

26:23.804 --> 26:26.202
is the minimum response
the Joint Chiefs will accept.

26:26.307 --> 26:28.392
No, no, no!

26:28.809 --> 26:31.311
Now, there is more
than one option here,

26:31.520 --> 26:34.440
And if one isn't occurring to us,
it's because we haven't
thought hard enough.

26:34.544 --> 26:36.838
Bobby, sometimes there
is only one right choice,

26:37.046 --> 26:39.132
and you thank God
when it's so clear.

26:39.340 --> 26:41.426
You're talking
about a sneak attack.

26:41.530 --> 26:43.094
How will that make us look?

26:43.615 --> 26:46.848
A big country blasting
a little one into the Stone Age.

26:47.056 --> 26:48.516
Oh, we'll be
everyone's favorite.

26:48.620 --> 26:49.976
Come on, Bobby, that's naive.

26:50.080 --> 26:51.644
This is the real world.

26:51.644 --> 26:52.999
You know that better than anybody.

26:53.104 --> 26:56.128
And you weren't so ethically
particular when we were
talking about options

26:56.232 --> 26:58.839
for removing Castro over at CIA.

27:11.247 --> 27:12.602
Bob...

27:13.123 --> 27:15.626
If we go ahead
with these air strikes,

27:16.251 --> 27:18.754
you know what it'll
come to in the end.

27:19.692 --> 27:21.361
There has got
to be something else.

27:21.673 --> 27:22.716
Give it to me.

27:22.820 --> 27:26.991
Now, I don't care how crazy,
inadequate, or stupid it sounds.

27:28.347 --> 27:30.015
Give it to me.

27:31.058 --> 27:33.143
6 months ago,
we gamed out a scenario.

27:33.143 --> 27:35.437
It's slow. It doesn't
get rid of the missiles.

27:35.437 --> 27:37.314
It's got a lot of drawbacks.

27:42.215 --> 27:44.717
The scenario calls
for a blockade of Cuba.

28:16.936 --> 28:18.396
The situation
is worse than we thought.

28:18.813 --> 28:21.315
We now count 40 missiles.

28:21.524 --> 28:22.462
40 missiles.

28:24.026 --> 28:26.320
Longer range IRBMs.

28:26.425 --> 28:29.136
They can hit every place
in the country

28:29.240 --> 28:30.283
except Seattle.

28:30.387 --> 28:32.159
Mr. President,

28:32.264 --> 28:34.245
you give me
the order right now,

28:34.453 --> 28:35.705
my planes will be
ready to carry out

28:35.809 --> 28:37.999
the air strikes in 3 days time.

28:38.207 --> 28:39.875
All you gotta do is say go.

28:39.980 --> 28:42.586
My boys will get
those red bastards.

28:44.880 --> 28:47.278
General, how long
until the Army's ready?

28:47.800 --> 28:51.345
We've just begun
the mobilization under cover
of a pre-arranged exercise, sir.

28:51.345 --> 28:53.430
We're looking at another
week and a half.

28:53.639 --> 28:55.933
But you can order the strikes now.

28:56.871 --> 28:59.269
The plans call for
an 8-day air campaign.

28:59.687 --> 29:02.710
It'll light a fire under
the Army's ass to get in place.

29:03.962 --> 29:06.673
General LeMay, do you truly believe
that's our best course of action?

29:06.777 --> 29:09.592
Mr. President, I believe
it is the only course of action.

29:09.801 --> 29:11.782
America is in danger.

29:11.886 --> 29:14.076
Those missiles are
a threat to our bomber bases

29:14.180 --> 29:16.057
and the safety
of our nuclear deterrent.

29:16.161 --> 29:17.412
Now, without our deterrent,

29:17.517 --> 29:20.749
there's nothing to keep the enemy
from choosing general nuclear war.

29:22.209 --> 29:23.668
It's our duty, sir,

29:23.773 --> 29:25.754
our responsibility
to the American people

29:25.858 --> 29:27.318
to take out those missiles

29:27.422 --> 29:30.550
and return stability to
the strategic situation.

29:30.759 --> 29:33.053
The big red dog is
digging in our backyard,

29:33.053 --> 29:35.138
and we are justified
in shooting him.

29:35.138 --> 29:39.726
Sir, we have a rapidly closing
window of opportunity

29:39.830 --> 29:42.645
where we can prevent
those missiles from ever
becoming operational.

29:43.480 --> 29:46.608
The other options
do not guarantee

29:46.712 --> 29:49.631
the end result that
we can guarantee.

29:49.736 --> 29:52.238
However, as more time goes by,

29:52.238 --> 29:55.158
the less reliable the choice
we can offer you becomes.

29:55.575 --> 29:57.035
Mr. President,

29:57.035 --> 29:59.016
the motto I chose for SAC

29:59.120 --> 30:00.580
is "Peace is our Profession."

30:01.310 --> 30:04.125
Now, God forbid we find
ourselves in a nuclear exchange,

30:04.229 --> 30:06.106
but if launched,
those missiles from Cuba

30:06.315 --> 30:08.608
would kill a lot of Americans.

30:09.130 --> 30:10.798
The very presence
of those missiles

30:10.902 --> 30:12.884
gives the Soviets
first-strike capability.

30:13.509 --> 30:16.846
Those missiles make
a nuclear exchange more likely,

30:16.846 --> 30:19.557
and that is why I'm being
such a pain in the ass

30:19.557 --> 30:22.476
about destroying them and
dstroying them immediately.

30:23.936 --> 30:25.396
Hell, even Mac agrees.

30:27.898 --> 30:31.652
And, sir, given your own
statements about Cuba,

30:31.756 --> 30:36.657
I think a blockade
or a bunch of political talk

30:36.761 --> 30:39.055
would be considered by a lot
of our friends and neutrals

30:39.159 --> 30:41.036
as a pretty weak response.

30:42.183 --> 30:44.790
I suspect that many
of our own citizens

30:44.894 --> 30:46.667
might feel the same way.

30:48.231 --> 30:51.046
You're in a pretty bad fix,
Mr. President.

30:54.487 --> 30:55.634
What did you say?

30:58.032 --> 30:59.596
You're in a pretty bad fix.

31:01.890 --> 31:04.497
Maybe you haven't noticed
you're in it with me.

31:07.938 --> 31:10.649
Now, General, what
are the Soviets gonna do

31:10.857 --> 31:11.691
when we attack?

31:13.777 --> 31:14.819
Nothing.

31:15.445 --> 31:16.696
Nothing?

31:16.801 --> 31:17.947
Nothing,

31:18.260 --> 31:20.971
because the only
alternative open to them

31:22.014 --> 31:24.099
is one they can't choose.

31:25.455 --> 31:27.227
You know, they're—

31:27.332 --> 31:30.043
They're not just missiles
we're gonna be destroying, General.

31:30.043 --> 31:34.005
If we kill Soviet soldiers,
they're gonna respond.

31:35.048 --> 31:37.863
I mean, how would we respond
if they killed ours?

31:37.967 --> 31:41.408
No, they're gonna
do something, General.
I can promise you that.

31:44.953 --> 31:47.456
Those goddamn Kennedys are
gonna destroy this country

31:47.560 --> 31:49.645
if we don't do something
about this.

31:51.105 --> 31:52.461
We're headed out to the backyard

31:52.565 --> 31:54.859
to take a look
for that big red dog.

31:55.380 --> 31:56.736
Thanks, Bob.

31:57.153 --> 31:59.030
I was hoping LeMay pushed you,

31:59.134 --> 32:01.115
because I was ready to knock
that son of a bitch across the room.

32:01.219 --> 32:03.096
We knew it was coming.
And I'll tell you one thing, Kenny,

32:03.200 --> 32:05.286
those brass heads
have one big advantage.

32:05.390 --> 32:06.745
That is, if we do
what they want us to do,

32:06.954 --> 32:09.665
there's none of us gonna be left
alive to tell 'em they were wrong.

32:09.769 --> 32:13.002
Mr. President, we need to
go over what you're going to say.

32:13.314 --> 32:15.087
Gromyko should be
on his way by now.

32:15.191 --> 32:16.547
Now, there's still
no sign that they know

32:16.755 --> 32:17.902
that we know
about the missiles.

32:18.111 --> 32:19.675
Well, we're gonna
keep it that way.

32:35.941 --> 32:37.088
Kenny?

32:37.192 --> 32:38.652
I'll be right there.

32:40.320 --> 32:42.406
I'm getting funny questions
from the guys.

32:42.510 --> 32:44.074
Yeah? What sort of questions?

32:44.178 --> 32:46.263
About some sort
of military exercises?

32:46.368 --> 32:48.036
You want me to do my job
handling the press,

32:48.036 --> 32:49.809
I need to know what's going on.

32:49.913 --> 32:52.832
- Military exercises?
- Yeah, military exercises.

32:53.562 --> 32:55.231
Haven't heard anything about it.

32:55.335 --> 32:56.273
Ask Bundy.

32:56.378 --> 32:58.359
I did. He said to ask you.

33:00.340 --> 33:02.008
Mr. Gromyko,
this way, please.

33:02.112 --> 33:04.823
Mr. Dobrynin, what are
your hopes for the meeting?

33:05.136 --> 33:07.430
Mr. Gromyko, can you give us
a statement, please?

33:08.786 --> 33:10.141
Robert.

33:10.662 --> 33:12.644
- Hugh, how are you?
- Good.

33:15.772 --> 33:17.231
Excuse me, Joan.

33:17.231 --> 33:20.360
So, tell me about
this military exercise that's
going on down in Puerto Rico.

33:20.464 --> 33:21.402
What?

33:21.506 --> 33:25.782
It's called ORTSAC, I believe.
Castro spelled backwards.

33:25.886 --> 33:29.535
ORTSAC? I... I don't know
what you're talking about.

33:29.535 --> 33:31.725
Me, either. Why?

33:31.829 --> 33:34.332
Well, because maybe
the President and Gromyko
are gonna talk about it.

33:34.540 --> 33:37.043
If you're trying to drum
something up, Johnny, forget it.

33:37.251 --> 33:39.545
This meeting's been
on the books for months.

33:39.858 --> 33:43.090
Far as I know,
it's just a friendly talk
on U.S. -Soviet relations.

33:44.341 --> 33:45.905
Sir! Sir!

33:46.635 --> 33:47.991
Mr. President!

33:49.763 --> 33:52.892
All right, hold it, guys. Hold it.
You'll get your pictures.

33:53.934 --> 33:54.768
Does it?

33:56.228 --> 33:57.792
Mm-hmm.

33:58.314 --> 33:59.669
I'll be damned.

34:01.650 --> 34:03.631
Kind of simple for the Pentagon.

34:08.114 --> 34:10.929
What is this meeting about, sir?

34:13.224 --> 34:14.161
Sir!

34:14.266 --> 34:16.248
Mr. Gromyko,
thank you for coming.

34:16.248 --> 34:17.812
Hold on, guys. One minute.

34:23.338 --> 34:25.422
Gentlemen, would you mind
shaking hands?

34:27.196 --> 34:29.072
So that there should be
no misunderstanding

34:29.177 --> 34:31.054
the position
of the United States,

34:31.054 --> 34:34.599
which has been made clear
by the Attorney General
to Ambassador Dobrynin here,

34:34.808 --> 34:38.143
I shall read a sentence from
my statement to the press
dated September 13th.

34:39.083 --> 34:41.168
"Should missiles
or offensive weapons

34:41.272 --> 34:42.940
"be placed in Cuba,

34:42.940 --> 34:44.609
"it would present
the gravest threat

34:44.713 --> 34:46.485
to U.S. National security."

34:46.590 --> 34:48.257
Mr. President,

34:48.362 --> 34:51.491
as Premier Khrushchev's own
statement of September 13th
assured you,

34:51.594 --> 34:53.159
our military assistance
to Cuba

34:53.263 --> 34:55.870
is of a defensive nature only.

35:02.022 --> 35:03.795
So I do not
misunderstand you,

35:04.107 --> 35:07.131
There are no offensive
weapons in Cuba?

35:07.340 --> 35:10.364
Premier Khrushchev's
statement of September 13th

35:10.468 --> 35:13.075
remains the position
of the Soviet Government.

35:13.179 --> 35:15.577
To that,
I have nothing to add.

35:16.828 --> 35:18.497
Well, that's good enough for me.

35:19.331 --> 35:20.165
Thanks so much.

35:20.478 --> 35:21.937
Thank you.

35:24.961 --> 35:26.942
Gentlemen, if you'll
come with me, please.

35:26.942 --> 35:29.236
A most constructive meeting.

35:35.909 --> 35:38.308
- What happened?
- Lying bastard.

35:38.516 --> 35:39.663
Lied right to my face.

35:39.767 --> 35:41.123
We're split down the middle.

35:41.227 --> 35:44.042
If I held a vote,
I think air strike would
beat blockade by a vote or two.

35:44.251 --> 35:46.858
I want a consensus. I mean,
either air strike or blockade,

35:46.962 --> 35:48.526
but something everyone's
going to stand by,

35:48.839 --> 35:50.716
even if they don't like it.

35:51.341 --> 35:54.782
I need it by Saturday.
Make it happen.

35:54.886 --> 35:56.346
What if I can't?

35:57.910 --> 36:00.413
We go into this split,
the Russians will know it.

36:00.830 --> 36:02.498
They'll know it
and use it against us.

36:02.602 --> 36:05.209
Have you canceled Chicago
and the rest of the weekend yet?

36:05.522 --> 36:08.441
If you don't show for Chicago,
everyone'll know there's
something going on.

36:08.650 --> 36:10.944
- I don't care. Just cancel it.
- Forget it!

36:12.821 --> 36:15.532
I'm not calling
and canceling on Daley.

36:17.826 --> 36:20.015
You call and cancel on Daley.

36:20.120 --> 36:21.475
You're scared
to cancel on Daley?

36:21.579 --> 36:23.978
You're damn right
I'm scared.

36:26.584 --> 36:27.836
Well, I'm not.

36:32.006 --> 36:33.466
Watch this.

36:35.134 --> 36:36.594
Welcome to Chicago,
Mr. President.

36:36.698 --> 36:39.305
Mr. Mayor, I wouldn't miss
this event for the world.

36:39.514 --> 36:41.182
Mr. President, over here!

36:41.599 --> 36:42.955
Mayor Daley!

36:44.519 --> 36:45.666
Let's go.

36:46.187 --> 36:48.168
Tonight, you're going to
experience some true Midwest...

36:48.377 --> 36:49.732
Kenny! What's going on?

36:49.941 --> 36:53.173
Now the guys are
hounding me about some
troop movements in Florida?

36:53.381 --> 36:54.528
What are you telling them?

36:54.528 --> 36:55.571
The truth— I don't know.

36:55.675 --> 36:57.761
- Am I out of the loop
on something?
- No.

36:58.803 --> 37:02.349
Tell them you' ve looked into it,
and all it is is an exercise.

37:03.183 --> 37:04.851
Oh, and, Pierre,

37:04.955 --> 37:07.041
Tomorrow, the President
may have a cold.

37:07.249 --> 37:08.918
- A what?
- A cold.

37:11.629 --> 37:13.818
Kenny, do I get
any input around here?

37:15.799 --> 37:17.259
Yeah.

37:17.363 --> 37:19.345
How bad it is is up to you.

37:27.895 --> 37:29.980
You know, there are major
rail disruptions in the South.

37:30.084 --> 37:32.065
2 Airborne Divisions
are on alert.

37:32.170 --> 37:35.402
Sounds to me like that
exercise is an invasion.

37:35.506 --> 37:37.800
Well, you know
how Bobby has it in
for the state of Mississippi.

37:38.113 --> 37:40.094
We're invading Cuba.

37:40.615 --> 37:42.909
Damn it, we are not
invading Cuba.

37:43.222 --> 37:44.682
Are you crazy?

37:44.786 --> 37:46.767
Nobody gives
a rat's ass about Cuba—

37:46.872 --> 37:48.540
Not now, not ever.

37:48.853 --> 37:51.772
If you print something like that,
all you're going to do
is inflame the situation.

37:51.981 --> 37:55.630
Nobody talks to assholes
who inflame situations.

37:55.839 --> 37:57.924
Assholes like that
can find themselves

37:58.028 --> 37:59.801
cut out of the loop.

38:00.114 --> 38:02.720
That's the first time
you've ever threatened me.

38:05.640 --> 38:06.683
All right.

38:06.787 --> 38:08.768
I won't print anything
until I have another source,

38:08.872 --> 38:10.645
But I promise you,
I'll get one.

38:15.754 --> 38:16.797
Bobby.

38:16.901 --> 38:18.778
<i>We've got a consensus
for a blockade,</i>

38:18.882 --> 38:22.219
but it won't last past tomorrow,
Kenny. You have to bring him back.

38:22.532 --> 38:25.243
<i>Oh, by the way,
China invaded India today.</i>

38:25.243 --> 38:27.224
You're kidding, aren't you?

38:27.537 --> 38:30.352
I wish I were. Galbraith's
handling it in New Delhi.

38:30.977 --> 38:32.750
<i>Makes you wonder
what's coming next.</i>

38:32.854 --> 38:36.921
Jesus, what is it about
the free world that pisses
the rest of the world off?

38:37.338 --> 38:39.215
I don't know.
We have Tupperware parties?

38:40.466 --> 38:41.404
Maybe.

38:42.134 --> 38:43.073
I'll see you tomorrow.

38:43.177 --> 38:44.324
<i>OK.</i>

38:44.428 --> 38:45.888
The President has a cold.

38:45.992 --> 38:47.869
He's canceling
the remainder of this trip

38:47.973 --> 38:50.684
and returning to Washington
on the advice of his doctor.

38:51.727 --> 38:52.874
President Kennedy!

38:52.978 --> 38:54.751
Is it true
you have a cold, sir?

38:54.855 --> 38:56.732
How do you feel,
Mr. President?

38:56.732 --> 38:58.087
Mr. President!

38:59.026 --> 39:01.528
What's the next step going
to be, Mr. President?

39:10.287 --> 39:11.330
Mr. President,

39:11.538 --> 39:13.415
our deliberations have
led us to the conclusion

39:13.519 --> 39:16.543
that a blockade
of offensive weapons to Cuba

39:16.647 --> 39:18.524
is our best option.

39:18.628 --> 39:21.965
A strong showing of support
from the Organization
of American States

39:22.069 --> 39:23.842
would give us
an umbrella of legitimacy.

39:23.946 --> 39:26.136
A blockade is technically
an act of war.

39:26.136 --> 39:28.326
Therefore, we recommend
calling the action

39:28.430 --> 39:29.368
a quarantine.

39:29.472 --> 39:33.018
Let's hope that translates into
Russian the way we want it to.

39:34.269 --> 39:37.293
There are between
20 and 30 Soviet ships

39:37.397 --> 39:39.587
underway to Cuba at this time.

39:39.899 --> 39:43.236
800 miles out, the Navy
will stop them, board,

39:43.236 --> 39:46.364
and any vessels containing weapons
will be turned back.

39:46.468 --> 39:49.284
A quarantine prevents any
more missiles from reaching Cuba,

39:49.388 --> 39:51.786
but it doesn't remove
the missiles already there.

39:51.890 --> 39:55.540
It gives the Soviets a chance
to pull back without a war.

39:55.748 --> 39:57.625
If they refuse
to remove the missiles,

39:57.625 --> 40:00.336
we retain the option
to strike and invade.

40:00.649 --> 40:02.213
A sneak attack would be counter

40:02.317 --> 40:04.611
to what the United States
stands for.

40:04.820 --> 40:06.488
It leaves us no room
to maneuver,

40:06.592 --> 40:10.137
and the inevitable Soviet response
would force us into a war.

40:10.346 --> 40:12.119
Mr. President,
there are still those of us

40:12.223 --> 40:15.142
who believe we should
proceed with the strikes.

40:15.247 --> 40:17.645
Sir, with a blockade,
we lose strategic surprise.

40:17.749 --> 40:19.939
We also run the risk
of the Soviets launching

40:19.939 --> 40:21.920
a first strike against us
if they decide

40:22.024 --> 40:24.005
they have to use
the missiles or lose them.

40:27.238 --> 40:30.574
So, quarantine or air strike.

40:30.783 --> 40:33.494
Ahem. There is a third option.

40:34.536 --> 40:35.788
With either course,

40:35.892 --> 40:38.603
we undertake
the risk of nuclear war.

40:39.333 --> 40:42.044
So it seems to me that
maybe one of us in this room

40:42.148 --> 40:43.608
should be a coward,

40:44.859 --> 40:46.840
So I guess I'll be.

40:47.674 --> 40:50.594
A third course
is to strike a deal.

40:51.011 --> 40:53.513
We trade Guantanamo
and our missiles in Turkey,

40:53.618 --> 40:55.912
get them to pull
their missiles out.

40:56.016 --> 40:57.997
We employ a back channel.

40:58.101 --> 41:00.917
We attribute the idea
to U Thant.

41:01.438 --> 41:04.045
U Thant then raises it
at the U.N.

41:06.443 --> 41:08.528
I don't think
that's possible, Adlai.

41:12.490 --> 41:14.472
I've not yet made
my final decision.

41:14.680 --> 41:17.078
I'll be asking the Networks
for airtime on Monday night.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.894
We'll announce
our course of action then.

41:21.666 --> 41:23.334
Ted, I want you to get
working on speeches

41:23.334 --> 41:25.524
for both quarantine
and air strike.

41:27.922 --> 41:30.425
Well, thank you for
all your advice, gentlemen.

41:31.572 --> 41:33.344
I did hear Adlai.

41:33.761 --> 41:36.472
Jesus, you'd think nobody learned
anything from World War II.

41:36.577 --> 41:37.932
Somebody had to say it.

41:37.932 --> 41:40.435
I respect Adlai for having the guts
to risk looking like an appeaser.

41:40.643 --> 41:42.103
We have to pull him.

41:42.311 --> 41:44.814
He's not going to be able to handle
the Soviets in front of the U.N.

41:45.022 --> 41:46.482
Zorin will eat him alive.

41:46.586 --> 41:48.463
We've got bigger
problems right now.

41:49.506 --> 41:50.444
Ladies?

41:50.549 --> 41:51.904
No, thank you.

41:56.805 --> 41:58.473
Honey, I'll be right back.

42:06.606 --> 42:07.649
Adlai?

42:08.274 --> 42:12.967
Ah. I just can't seem
to get away from you guys.

42:13.071 --> 42:15.260
Escaping for a night
on the town, eh?

42:15.365 --> 42:17.346
As D.C.'s most popular playboy,

42:17.346 --> 42:21.308
the President felt my presence
would be sorely missed, so

42:21.517 --> 42:24.853
in the interest of
National Security, here I am.

42:24.958 --> 42:27.356
Yes, gotta keep up appearances.

42:27.460 --> 42:29.441
Of course, I don't anymore.

42:31.526 --> 42:33.820
I'm a political dead man.

42:33.925 --> 42:36.114
Did you ever see anyone
cut his own throat

42:36.219 --> 42:37.783
like I did today?

42:39.347 --> 42:40.702
No, no.

42:41.328 --> 42:42.683
It's all right.

42:43.100 --> 42:45.811
And by the way,
I spoke to a friend.

42:46.333 --> 42:48.522
Reston and Franco have the story.

42:48.627 --> 42:51.129
The Times is going to
run it tomorrow.

42:53.840 --> 42:55.300
We're not gonna make it to Monday.

42:55.717 --> 42:56.551
Shit.

42:56.655 --> 42:58.845
<i>We can get Sorenson
to lean on Reston,</i>

42:58.845 --> 43:00.930
But you're gonna have
to call Orville Dryfoos.

43:01.139 --> 43:03.850
This is the sort of decision
a publisher makes himself.

43:04.476 --> 43:07.082
All right.
Thanks, Kenny.

43:08.855 --> 43:11.462
Yes, sir, I understand,
but, you know, we held
on the Bay of Pigs,

43:11.566 --> 43:14.277
and it was the
biggest mistake of my life.
What makes this different?

43:14.381 --> 43:15.945
Orville, I'm asking you
to hold the story

43:15.945 --> 43:19.282
until I can present our course
of action on Monday night.

43:22.201 --> 43:24.182
All right, but I'm gonna need
a reason to give my boys.

43:24.391 --> 43:26.268
They're gonna be screaming
for my head on a plate.

43:26.372 --> 43:28.040
<i>Listen, Orville,
you tell them this—</i>

43:28.979 --> 43:30.856
That they'll
be saving lives...

43:31.481 --> 43:33.045
including their own.

43:35.339 --> 43:36.590
Yes, Mr. President.

44:04.952 --> 44:06.829
How many Congressmen
have not responded yet?

44:07.037 --> 44:08.288
14.

44:08.914 --> 44:10.999
<i>- Boggs is in the Gulf fishing?
- Yes, sir.</i>

44:11.104 --> 44:12.876
I thought he was supposed
to be campaigning.

44:12.980 --> 44:14.127
<i>Well, he's not gone for long.</i>

44:14.336 --> 44:17.464
Jesus. Get a plane out
there and get him back.

44:19.132 --> 44:21.009
He wants to talk to LeMay again.

44:21.113 --> 44:22.782
He's still considering
air strikes.

44:33.417 --> 44:34.668
None of this works tomorrow.

44:34.773 --> 44:37.275
- Figure out how to cancel it.
- Yes, sir.

44:39.778 --> 44:40.820
We're on the phones.

44:51.039 --> 44:53.333
Cam, can you guarantee me
you'll get all the missiles?

44:57.712 --> 45:00.214
Sir, I guarantee we'll get
all the missiles we know about.

45:00.319 --> 45:03.864
Mr. President, we can get
better than 90%of them.

45:08.243 --> 45:11.371
I'll brief the Congressional leadership
tomorrow evening at 5:00.

45:12.935 --> 45:16.063
At 7:00, all United States
Armed Forces worldwide

45:16.689 --> 45:18.774
will stand up to DEFCON 3.

45:19.817 --> 45:21.798
I have a brief statement
to make.

45:22.215 --> 45:24.405
President Kennedy will
address the nation tonight

45:24.509 --> 45:25.656
on radio and television

45:25.760 --> 45:28.888
on a subject of
the highest national urgency.

45:29.201 --> 45:32.329
He has requested airtime
on all 3 Networks for 7 p.m.

45:32.538 --> 45:33.685
Thank you very much.

46:04.027 --> 46:06.217
I am not willing
to support anything

46:06.321 --> 46:07.781
but the toughest possible—

46:07.885 --> 46:10.805
Congress cannot give you
the support you're looking for.

46:10.909 --> 46:12.681
Mr. President! Sir?

46:12.786 --> 46:15.497
If they want this goddamn
job, they can have it.

46:15.601 --> 46:16.748
It's no great joy to me.

46:16.852 --> 46:18.103
Mr. President,
here's the speech.

46:18.208 --> 46:19.355
I made those changes you wanted.

46:19.459 --> 46:21.336
- I need a minute.
- Kenny, no.

46:21.440 --> 46:22.691
A minute.

46:28.426 --> 46:29.990
Look, I don't want
a goddamn pep talk.

46:30.199 --> 46:32.493
You're not the Harvard
quarterback anymore.

46:32.597 --> 46:34.057
We're on the brink here!

46:34.161 --> 46:37.289
They're trying to second-guess
me into World War 3.
Well, it's not gonna happen.

46:37.393 --> 46:39.687
- What did you think
Congress was gonna do?
- Well, I...

46:39.791 --> 46:42.085
Offer you
unconditional support?

46:42.502 --> 46:44.379
Kiss your Catholic ass?

46:45.109 --> 46:47.195
They don't think we even
deserve to be here.

46:47.299 --> 46:49.071
Well, what the hell
do you think?

46:49.176 --> 46:51.053
I think we haven't been
that impressive today.

46:51.157 --> 46:53.555
They have good reason
to question our judgment.

46:53.764 --> 46:55.328
What do you want, Kenny?

46:56.370 --> 46:57.517
I want you to sit down.

46:57.621 --> 46:59.394
Well, I'm not going to sit down!

47:00.124 --> 47:01.479
I want you to sit down,

47:01.584 --> 47:02.835
loosen your tie,
and take a minute—

47:02.939 --> 47:04.086
I haven't got a minute!

47:04.190 --> 47:06.693
You're the President
of the United States.

47:07.423 --> 47:08.987
They can wait for you.

47:14.930 --> 47:16.286
Well, why not?

47:19.727 --> 47:20.978
Things can't get much worse.

47:21.082 --> 47:23.376
Oh, I don't know.
We could have to...

47:23.480 --> 47:27.025
go down to Lyndon's ranch again
dressed up as cowboys.

47:29.528 --> 47:32.030
Shoot deer out of the back
of his Convertible.

47:34.533 --> 47:36.305
That was a bad day.

47:40.163 --> 47:42.144
You know, I thought
there'd be...

47:42.353 --> 47:44.126
more good days.

47:47.149 --> 47:49.652
You know, back when
we were in the wards,

47:50.382 --> 47:53.197
that day Bobby made me
come down and meet you?

47:53.718 --> 47:55.804
I didn't get you at first.

47:57.055 --> 47:58.932
I thought you were lucky.

47:59.870 --> 48:01.956
Your father had a lot of money.

48:02.164 --> 48:05.709
You were skinny.
Girls loved you.

48:06.648 --> 48:09.254
I thought I could beat
you and Bobby up together.

48:10.610 --> 48:16.032
But he just kept going
on and on about you.

48:17.075 --> 48:19.056
I thought it was because
he was your brother.

48:23.331 --> 48:24.999
But I was wrong.

48:28.127 --> 48:29.483
I was wrong.

48:48.251 --> 48:49.711
You sleeping?

48:50.962 --> 48:52.735
No. Not much.

48:53.777 --> 48:56.176
But I slept last night,
though, you know, and...

48:56.280 --> 48:57.635
Jeez, I...

48:59.095 --> 49:01.076
When I woke up, I just...

49:01.180 --> 49:04.934
Somehow I'd forgotten that
all this had happened, you know?

49:06.394 --> 49:09.939
Then, of course,
I remembered, and...

49:11.190 --> 49:13.901
I just wished for a second
somebody else was President.

49:14.840 --> 49:15.882
You mean that?

49:18.281 --> 49:19.845
I said, for a second.

49:26.518 --> 49:29.542
Boy, there is a lot of noise
out there, Kenny.

49:35.068 --> 49:37.258
You know what you're doing,
Mr. President.

49:38.822 --> 49:40.594
You're going to make
the best call you can,

49:40.803 --> 49:42.367
and you know they're
going to second-guess you.

49:42.680 --> 49:44.244
So what?

49:46.016 --> 49:48.414
We're just gonna have to
take our beatings as we go.

49:54.775 --> 49:56.652
So, what are we
going to do now?

49:58.320 --> 49:59.675
I'm going on TV.

50:09.373 --> 50:11.979
You know, maybe the American
people will go with me.

50:13.543 --> 50:15.212
Even if their...

50:16.567 --> 50:18.965
elected representatives won't.

50:25.013 --> 50:27.098
You wear something
nice for the TV.

50:27.307 --> 50:28.662
Make sure Jackie picks it.

50:35.648 --> 50:36.900
Excuse me.

50:39.089 --> 50:41.696
Oh, right. Thanks, Pierre.
Now, I just changed—

50:41.904 --> 50:43.156
OK, everybody,
I think we're ready.

50:47.326 --> 50:49.203
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

50:50.455 --> 50:55.042
Mr. President,
in 5, 4, 3, 2...

50:55.668 --> 50:57.858
Good evening,
my fellow citizens.

50:57.962 --> 50:59.943
This Government, as promised,

51:00.152 --> 51:02.133
has maintained
the closest surveillance

51:02.550 --> 51:05.782
<i>of the Soviet military buildup
on the island of Cuba.</i>

51:06.095 --> 51:07.450
<i>Within the past week,</i>

51:07.763 --> 51:10.683
<i>unmistakable evidence
has established the fact</i>

51:10.787 --> 51:13.811
<i>that a series
of offensive missile sites</i>

51:13.811 --> 51:16.939
<i>is now in preparation
on that imprisoned island.</i>

51:17.043 --> 51:19.441
<i>The purpose of these bases
can be none other</i>

51:19.546 --> 51:22.361
<i>than to provide
a nuclear strike capability</i>

51:22.465 --> 51:23.716
<i>against
the Western Hemisphere.</i>

51:24.551 --> 51:27.262
<i>Acting therefore in the defense
of our own security</i>

51:27.366 --> 51:30.390
<i>and under the authority entrusted
to me by the Constitution,</i>

51:30.494 --> 51:32.788
<i>I have directed
that the following initial steps</i>

51:32.892 --> 51:34.143
<i>be taken immediately.</i>

51:34.769 --> 51:37.480
<i>First, to halt
this offensive buildup,</i>

51:37.584 --> 51:40.087
<i>a strict quarantine on all
offensive military equipment</i>

51:40.191 --> 51:42.276
<i>under shipment to Cuba
is being initiated.</i>

51:42.798 --> 51:45.822
<i>All ships of any kind,
bound for Cuba,</i>

51:45.926 --> 51:48.011
<i>from whatever nation or port,</i>

51:48.011 --> 51:51.869
<i>will, if found to contain
cargos of offensive weapons,
be turned back.</i>

51:52.078 --> 51:54.580
<i>Second, I have directed
the continued and increased</i>

51:54.684 --> 51:57.604
<i>close surveillance of Cuba
and its military buildup,</i>

51:57.812 --> 52:00.315
<i>and should these military
preparations continue,</i>

52:00.419 --> 52:02.609
<i>further action will be justified.</i>

52:02.713 --> 52:06.258
<i>I have directed the Armed Forces
to prepare for any eventualities.</i>

52:06.363 --> 52:09.699
<i>And third, it shall be
the policy of this nation</i>

52:10.221 --> 52:12.514
<i>to regard any nuclear missile
launched from Cuba</i>

52:12.619 --> 52:14.704
<i>against any nation
in the Western Hemisphere</i>

52:14.913 --> 52:16.998
<i>as an attack
by the Soviet Union</i>

52:17.207 --> 52:18.771
<i>on the United States</i>

52:18.875 --> 52:21.586
<i>requiring a full
retaliatory response</i>

52:21.690 --> 52:22.837
<i>upon the Soviet Union.</i>

52:32.221 --> 52:33.890
Good speech, Teddy.

52:34.307 --> 52:37.122
Yeah, well, I guess
I get to keep my job.

52:38.060 --> 52:41.606
No. It was
a really good speech.

52:42.648 --> 52:45.463
I can't imagine what you did
with the air strikes version.

52:50.156 --> 52:51.720
I wasn't able
to write it, Kenny.

52:54.326 --> 52:57.454
It's kind of hard
to write the unthinkable.

52:57.767 --> 53:00.791
I tried. I just...

53:03.502 --> 53:04.858
I couldn't.

53:09.237 --> 53:11.114
We're getting
the Soviet response.

53:11.218 --> 53:13.095
It's coming in on the teletype.

53:14.555 --> 53:16.014
"The community
of nations recognizes

53:16.119 --> 53:18.517
the fundamental right
of freedom of the seas..."

53:18.621 --> 53:20.081
It's horseshit.

53:21.124 --> 53:22.479
I agree.

53:29.361 --> 53:31.655
They don't know how to respond yet.

53:32.906 --> 53:36.764
So now you're Khrushchev.
What do you do?

53:41.456 --> 53:43.333
You run the blockade.

53:44.271 --> 53:45.314
They'll run the blockade.

53:45.523 --> 53:49.381
Which is exactly what they
appear to be preparing to do,
Mr. President.

53:49.485 --> 53:52.300
We're tracking 26 ships
inbound for Cuba.

53:52.300 --> 53:54.803
They show no sign
of changing course.

53:54.803 --> 53:57.305
The closest ships,
the Gagarin and the Kimovsk,

53:57.409 --> 54:00.120
will make the quarantine line
by this time tomorrow.

54:00.225 --> 54:03.248
Admiral Anderson,
if the ships do not stop,

54:03.353 --> 54:05.542
exactly what are
our rules of engagement?

54:05.647 --> 54:09.192
Well, Russian-speaking personnel
have been transferred
to all our ships.

54:09.400 --> 54:11.381
When the quarantine
takes place in the morning,

54:11.486 --> 54:14.926
our ships will attempt
to make radio contact
with the approaching vessels.

54:15.135 --> 54:18.159
They'll be ordered to reduce speed
and standby for inspection.

54:18.993 --> 54:22.017
An inspection team will then
board and search the vessel.

54:22.121 --> 54:25.458
If weapons are found,
the ship will be ordered
out of the quarantine area,

54:25.770 --> 54:28.586
or if they refuse, they'll
be towed into the nearest port.

54:29.003 --> 54:30.775
What happens if
the ship doesn't stop

54:30.880 --> 54:32.444
for inspection
or want to be towed?

54:32.652 --> 54:34.321
We fire a warning shot
across their bow.

54:34.633 --> 54:37.449
And what happens if the ship
ignores the warning shot?

54:37.553 --> 54:41.098
We then fire at its rudder,
disable it, and carry on
our inspection.

54:41.307 --> 54:43.600
There will be no shooting
without my explicit orders.

54:45.165 --> 54:46.103
Is that understood?

54:46.833 --> 54:48.188
Yes, sir.

54:48.188 --> 54:50.274
Well, Admiral, looks like
it's up to the Navy.

54:50.378 --> 54:52.046
The Navy won't let you down, sir.

54:52.255 --> 54:54.027
There's one other thing,
Mr. President.

54:54.132 --> 54:57.468
We're commencing low-level
photography runs over Cuba
this morning.

54:57.677 --> 55:00.388
It'll be more detailed
than the U-2 photography.

55:00.492 --> 55:03.933
This way, we'll be able
to firm up our estimates
of the missiles' readiness

55:04.037 --> 55:05.706
and develop target packages
for strikes,

55:05.810 --> 55:07.478
if you should order them, sir.

55:07.582 --> 55:10.502
To protect our pilots,
we're prepared to retaliate
against any SAM site

55:10.710 --> 55:13.526
or anti-aircraft battery
that may open fire.

55:13.630 --> 55:15.090
We have a flight
of Thunderchiefs

55:15.090 --> 55:16.862
that'll be able to respond
within minutes

55:16.967 --> 55:18.739
to any attacks on our planes.

55:27.081 --> 55:29.166
I got a bad feeling about
what's going on in there.

55:29.270 --> 55:32.086
In the morning, I'm taking
charge of the blockade
from the Situation Room,

55:32.190 --> 55:35.214
and McNamara is going to set up shop
in the flag plot at the Pentagon
and keep an eye on things there.

55:35.318 --> 55:36.986
Good, because you'll
get armed boarders

55:37.195 --> 55:38.655
climbing onto Soviet ships,

55:38.759 --> 55:40.531
with shots being fired
across bows—

55:40.636 --> 55:42.825
- Well, what about these
low-level flights?
- We need the flights.

55:42.930 --> 55:45.015
They're starting in what?
An hour.

55:45.119 --> 55:47.413
You realize what you're
letting yourself in for?

55:47.518 --> 55:49.916
We need the flights,
because the minute that first
missile becomes operational,

55:50.020 --> 55:51.271
we gotta go in there
and destroy it.

55:51.375 --> 55:53.252
Fair enough,
but Castro's on alert,

55:53.357 --> 55:55.442
and we're flying attack
planes over their sites

55:55.546 --> 55:56.589
on the deck!

55:57.944 --> 55:59.821
There's no way for them to know
we're carrying cameras, not bombs.

56:00.030 --> 56:00.968
God damn it!

56:01.073 --> 56:03.679
We're going to be shot at,
plain and simple.

56:05.869 --> 56:07.433
I'm your political advisor.

56:07.954 --> 56:10.248
I'm giving you
a political analysis here.

56:10.352 --> 56:13.481
This... This is a set-up.

56:14.210 --> 56:16.400
The Chiefs want to go in.

56:16.400 --> 56:18.485
They need to redeem themselves
for the Bay of Pigs.

56:18.694 --> 56:20.988
They gotta go in this time.
They got to do it right.

56:22.343 --> 56:23.490
I'm going to protect those pilots.

56:26.514 --> 56:28.912
They're boxing us in with
these rules of engagement.

56:29.017 --> 56:31.206
If you agree to them and
one of our planes gets knocked down

56:31.311 --> 56:33.187
or one of the ships
won't stop for inspection,

56:33.292 --> 56:35.169
the Chiefs will have us
by the balls

56:35.586 --> 56:38.088
and will force us
to start shooting.

56:41.842 --> 56:43.302
They want a war, Jack,

56:43.406 --> 56:45.804
and they're arranging
things to get one.

56:48.619 --> 56:50.392
How does a man get to
a place where he can say,

56:50.392 --> 56:52.894
"Throw those lives away,"
so easily?

56:54.875 --> 56:56.648
Maybe it's harder for them
to say than they let on,

56:56.752 --> 56:59.985
but at the very least, they
believe it's in our best interest.

57:00.610 --> 57:02.174
And you know what?

57:03.008 --> 57:06.554
At the end of the day,
they may well end up being right.

57:12.810 --> 57:14.791
Well, I'll tell you one thing,
we're going to have to triple-check

57:14.999 --> 57:16.355
everything the Chiefs say to us

57:16.459 --> 57:18.232
with the guys that
actually have to do it.

57:18.336 --> 57:20.838
And nobody's to know about this,
because l—but Bobby.

57:20.943 --> 57:23.028
I need redundant control
over what happens out there.

57:23.132 --> 57:25.322
And if things
aren't as advertised,

57:25.426 --> 57:27.512
then you're going to
make sure they come out
the way I want them to come out.

57:27.616 --> 57:31.057
- That's gonna be—
- Starting with this
low-level flight thing.

57:31.787 --> 57:32.829
That's gonna be tough.

57:32.934 --> 57:35.123
You know how these guys are
about their chains-of-command.

57:36.270 --> 57:37.834
Listen, you tell them
those chains-of-command

57:37.939 --> 57:39.607
end at one place— Me.

57:42.839 --> 57:44.403
Go ahead, sir.

57:44.612 --> 57:47.114
Speak up, lady. I cannot hear you.
I got a train to catch,

57:47.219 --> 57:49.408
and I'd like to be home
by Christmas. Yeah?

57:50.034 --> 57:51.494
- That's the one.
- Mr. O'Donnell.

57:51.702 --> 57:53.996
- What's her name?
- Margaret.

57:54.726 --> 57:57.750
- Margaret.
- Give me a break.
I'm doing the best that I can.

57:57.854 --> 58:00.252
Yes, sir. I understand exactly
what you're talking about.

58:00.356 --> 58:01.920
I speak the language, too.
What?

58:02.025 --> 58:05.153
Margaret, would you mind
helping me with something?

58:05.257 --> 58:06.925
What do you need, honey?

58:07.134 --> 58:09.636
That tone of voice specifically.

58:10.888 --> 58:13.182
What tone of voice? What
the hell is he talking about?

58:13.286 --> 58:15.475
I told you, sir—
I'm sorry. You're outta here.

58:21.419 --> 58:22.879
Ready Room.

58:23.191 --> 58:25.173
Hey, Skipper,
what are you doin'?

58:25.277 --> 58:27.049
- Lookin' out the door.
- I'll get him for you.

58:27.154 --> 58:29.135
- For what?
- Cuba.

58:29.239 --> 58:30.490
Skipper!

58:30.907 --> 58:32.054
Telephone.

58:38.728 --> 58:40.292
<i>- Commander Ecker.
- Commander Ecker?</i>

58:40.500 --> 58:43.420
This is the White House operator.
Please hold for...

58:43.524 --> 58:44.567
Shit.

58:44.671 --> 58:47.278
Honey, you don't know
what shit is.

58:48.529 --> 58:51.657
Commander?
My name's Ken O'Donnell,

58:51.761 --> 58:53.012
Special Assistant
to the President.

58:53.429 --> 58:54.472
Yes, sir.

58:54.576 --> 58:57.600
The President's instructed me
to pass along an order to you.

58:57.913 --> 58:59.373
You are not to get shot down.

59:00.624 --> 59:02.814
Uh... We'll do our best, sir.

59:02.918 --> 59:04.899
I don't think you
understand me, Commander.

59:05.003 --> 59:08.444
You're not to get shot down
under any circumstances.

59:09.070 --> 59:11.468
<i>Whatever happens up there,
you were not shot at.</i>

59:11.572 --> 59:13.345
<i>Mechanical failures are fine.</i>

59:13.449 --> 59:15.326
Crashing into mountains, fine...

59:15.430 --> 59:18.037
But you and your men
are not to be shot at,

59:18.246 --> 59:20.748
fired at, or launched upon.

59:20.957 --> 59:23.563
Excuse me, sir.
What the hell is going on here?

59:23.668 --> 59:25.023
<i>Commander,
if you are fired upon,</i>

59:25.127 --> 59:27.943
The President will be forced to
attack the sites that fire on you.

59:28.985 --> 59:30.862
<i>He doesn't want
to have to do that.</i>

59:30.966 --> 59:33.677
It's very important that he doesn't,
or things could go

59:33.782 --> 59:35.346
very badly out of control.

59:35.659 --> 59:37.014
What about my men?

59:37.223 --> 59:38.682
<i>If we don't have
anybody to protect us,</i>

59:38.682 --> 59:40.872
<i>I'm gonna be writing
letters home to parents.</i>

59:40.976 --> 59:42.436
If the President
protects you, Commander,

59:42.540 --> 59:46.190
he may have to do it
with the bomb.

59:46.920 --> 59:50.360
Now, I've know the man
for 15 years. The problem is...

59:50.465 --> 59:52.237
He will protect you.

59:52.550 --> 59:55.678
So I'm asking,
don't make him protect you.

59:55.991 --> 59:57.138
Don't get shot at.

59:58.806 --> 01:00:01.517
OK, Mr. O'Donnell,
we'll do what we can.

01:00:02.247 --> 01:00:03.707
I know you will.

01:00:04.645 --> 01:00:06.939
- Good luck, you guys.
- Find your way back!

01:00:10.797 --> 01:00:12.257
Stay close.

01:00:14.655 --> 01:00:15.802
Hey, Joey.

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.485
- See ya, Joey.
- Thanks, Joey.

01:00:32.902 --> 01:00:34.571
Ready to go, Jeremy?

01:00:34.988 --> 01:00:36.760
- Hey, Bruce.
- Skipper?

01:00:37.282 --> 01:00:39.784
Never mind. Just do what I do.
Hand signs only?

01:00:39.784 --> 01:00:41.035
Gotcha.

01:00:52.922 --> 01:00:54.903
You are clear
and ready to go, sir!

01:00:55.007 --> 01:00:56.363
Good luck, Skipper!

01:03:14.728 --> 01:03:17.439
Oh-ho, man! Shit!
Did you see it?

01:03:21.193 --> 01:03:22.444
Man, you were lucky, Skipper.

01:03:22.548 --> 01:03:25.468
Damn sparrows.
Must've been migrating.

01:03:25.572 --> 01:03:26.719
Sparrows?

01:03:26.823 --> 01:03:29.534
Probably hit a couple hundred of 'em.
How many did you hit, Bruce?

01:03:29.847 --> 01:03:31.203
Sparrows?

01:03:34.748 --> 01:03:35.790
A few, I guess.

01:03:35.999 --> 01:03:38.919
These, uh, 20 millimeter or
40 millimeter sparrows, sir?

01:03:39.023 --> 01:03:40.900
Those are bird strikes.

01:03:41.004 --> 01:03:43.089
Sparrows, to be precise.

01:03:44.028 --> 01:03:45.592
It's the way it is, guys.

01:03:46.322 --> 01:03:47.886
Get that film pack done.

01:03:52.682 --> 01:03:53.829
Commander Ecker.

01:03:53.933 --> 01:03:54.767
Hello.

01:03:54.872 --> 01:03:56.227
<i>- Sir.
- Commander.</i>

01:03:56.331 --> 01:03:58.417
Mr. O'Donnell, I've been
ordered to deliver the film

01:03:58.521 --> 01:04:00.189
to the Pentagon personally.

01:04:00.398 --> 01:04:01.336
What's going on here?

01:04:01.649 --> 01:04:03.735
The Chiefs must
want to talk to you.

01:04:04.777 --> 01:04:07.697
They're gonna want to know
if you were fired on. Were you?

01:04:07.801 --> 01:04:09.991
<i>You could say that, sir.</i>

01:04:14.057 --> 01:04:15.934
Commander, listen to me.

01:04:16.038 --> 01:04:17.811
Now, I know this
must fly in the face

01:04:17.915 --> 01:04:20.522
of everything
you've come to serve,

01:04:20.939 --> 01:04:24.380
but I'm asking you to look
through this to the other side.

01:04:27.717 --> 01:04:29.593
Commander William B. Ecker
reporting as ordered.

01:04:29.698 --> 01:04:31.679
- Commander.
- Sir.

01:04:31.679 --> 01:04:33.660
Put your gear down over here.

01:04:34.703 --> 01:04:36.371
Would you like a glass
of water or anything?

01:04:36.475 --> 01:04:38.039
No, thank you, sir.

01:04:38.978 --> 01:04:40.437
- Sir.
- Commander.

01:04:40.854 --> 01:04:42.106
Have a seat.

01:04:45.338 --> 01:04:47.632
Now, Commander, I assume
you know why you're here.

01:04:47.736 --> 01:04:51.177
Son, I want to know just one thing.

01:04:51.490 --> 01:04:54.305
Those bastards shoot
so much as a BB gun at you?

01:04:57.955 --> 01:04:59.936
It was a cakewalk, sir.

01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:02.438
Mr. President,

01:05:02.542 --> 01:05:04.524
the O. A.S. Meeting
starts in less than an hour.

01:05:04.628 --> 01:05:06.922
Well, good. I think
we need this one, Dean.

01:05:07.026 --> 01:05:08.799
We can't expect miracles.

01:05:08.903 --> 01:05:11.197
Listen, the quarantine
is legal if we get a mandate.

01:05:11.301 --> 01:05:14.325
Otherwise, it's an act of war
in the eyes of the world,

01:05:14.429 --> 01:05:16.306
so you gotta get me the vote,

01:05:16.410 --> 01:05:17.661
and, you know, make it unanimous.

01:05:17.766 --> 01:05:19.538
Mr. President, the Organization
of American States

01:05:19.643 --> 01:05:20.894
hasn't had a unanimous vote—

01:05:20.998 --> 01:05:22.979
Unanimous... Dean.

01:05:50.298 --> 01:05:52.279
In accordance with
this afternoon's vote

01:05:52.383 --> 01:05:54.677
at the Organization
of American States,

01:05:54.677 --> 01:05:57.388
the quarantine
will hereby be effective

01:05:57.388 --> 01:05:59.682
as of 10:00 tomorrow morning.

01:06:16.261 --> 01:06:17.408
<i>At 8 a.m. This morning,</i>

01:06:17.408 --> 01:06:19.702
<i>the United States
detonated a hydrogen bomb</i>

01:06:19.806 --> 01:06:22.725
<i>above Johnston Island
in the South Pacific.</i>

01:06:22.830 --> 01:06:25.749
<i>The blast was quickly condemned
by the Soviet Union,</i>

01:06:25.854 --> 01:06:28.669
<i>who called upon all nations
to denounce the United States</i>

01:06:28.773 --> 01:06:30.754
<i>for bringing the world
to the brink of destruction.</i>

01:06:30.858 --> 01:06:32.840
Who the hell
authorized this test?

01:06:32.944 --> 01:06:34.299
Christ, what is this gonna
say to the Russians?

01:06:34.404 --> 01:06:36.072
They look warlike?

01:06:36.176 --> 01:06:38.262
Jesus Christ. We're
lighting off nuclear weapons

01:06:38.366 --> 01:06:40.138
like it's our own private
Fourth of July.

01:06:40.243 --> 01:06:41.390
You know what we should have done?

01:06:41.598 --> 01:06:44.309
We should've brought in the guys
from the Atomic Energy Commission

01:06:44.935 --> 01:06:46.707
and talked this through,
you know?

01:06:46.812 --> 01:06:49.523
Looked at these tests
a little harder before

01:06:49.835 --> 01:06:51.608
just givin' the go-ahead.

01:06:54.110 --> 01:06:57.447
You know, last summer I read
a book, "The Guns of August".

01:06:58.490 --> 01:07:01.305
I wish every man on that
blockade line had read that book.

01:07:01.514 --> 01:07:03.807
It's World War I,
13 million killed.

01:07:03.912 --> 01:07:06.206
It was all because
the militaries of both alliances

01:07:06.414 --> 01:07:07.874
believed they were
so highly attuned

01:07:08.083 --> 01:07:10.064
to one another's movements
and dispositions,

01:07:10.168 --> 01:07:12.358
they could predict
one another's intentions,

01:07:12.462 --> 01:07:14.130
but all their theories
were based on the last war,

01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:16.737
and the world
and technology had changed,

01:07:16.945 --> 01:07:19.135
and those lessons
were no longer valid,

01:07:19.344 --> 01:07:22.159
but it was all they knew,
so the orders went out.

01:07:22.889 --> 01:07:24.766
Couldn't be rescinded.

01:07:27.894 --> 01:07:29.353
The man in the field,
his family at home,

01:07:29.458 --> 01:07:32.482
they couldn't even tell you
the reasons why their lives
were being destroyed.

01:07:35.922 --> 01:07:37.904
But why couldn't they stop it?

01:07:38.842 --> 01:07:40.719
What could they have done?

01:07:41.344 --> 01:07:43.430
Here we are 50 years later.

01:07:44.472 --> 01:07:47.288
If one of their ships
resists the inspection

01:07:47.913 --> 01:07:51.146
and we shoot out
its rudder and board,

01:07:51.563 --> 01:07:54.795
they shoot down one
of our planes in response,

01:07:55.525 --> 01:07:58.862
so we bomb their anti-aircraft sites.
In response to that...

01:07:59.904 --> 01:08:01.885
They attack Berlin.

01:08:04.075 --> 01:08:05.848
So we invade Cuba.

01:08:08.871 --> 01:08:11.270
Then they fire their missiles.

01:08:15.232 --> 01:08:17.109
And we fire ours.

01:08:24.095 --> 01:08:27.118
Helen, I want you to keep
the kids close tomorrow.

01:08:28.161 --> 01:08:30.455
I want you to leave the TV on.

01:08:30.559 --> 01:08:32.019
I want you to sleep
with it on in the bedroom

01:08:32.124 --> 01:08:36.086
until I call you and tell you
you can turn it off.

01:08:36.294 --> 01:08:37.754
<i>What's happened?</i>

01:08:38.587 --> 01:08:41.403
Nothing. Nothing you don't
already know about.

01:08:41.508 --> 01:08:45.573
Just have the car
ready to go in case I call...

01:08:45.886 --> 01:08:48.180
or the Civil Defense Warning
comes on.

01:08:49.118 --> 01:08:50.996
<i>What happens to you?</i>

01:08:51.935 --> 01:08:54.124
I'm not leaving without you.

01:08:55.688 --> 01:08:58.191
I'll be evacuated
with the President.

01:09:01.527 --> 01:09:02.987
Great.

01:09:04.238 --> 01:09:05.490
Great.

01:09:06.011 --> 01:09:08.930
And while you're under a rock
somewhere with the President,

01:09:09.555 --> 01:09:12.267
what am I supposed to do
with our 5 children, Kenny?

01:09:12.371 --> 01:09:15.082
Honey, we're not gonna
let it come to that.

01:09:15.499 --> 01:09:16.645
I promise.

01:09:17.898 --> 01:09:19.879
<i>Jack and Bobby, they're...</i>

01:09:21.026 --> 01:09:22.903
They're smart guys.

01:09:26.238 --> 01:09:28.011
You're smart, too.

01:09:32.183 --> 01:09:34.059
Not like them.

01:09:40.627 --> 01:09:41.984
Well, hi, Ken.

01:09:47.926 --> 01:09:49.595
Helen just asked me
what sort of arrangements

01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:51.577
we have for the families.

01:09:51.993 --> 01:09:54.287
Yeah, I just checked that myself.

01:09:54.496 --> 01:09:56.790
They're being issued
identity cards,

01:09:56.894 --> 01:09:59.084
and the call comes,
evacuation officers

01:09:59.293 --> 01:10:01.795
meet them at
pre-arranged departure areas.

01:10:01.899 --> 01:10:03.672
They go by helicopter
to Mount Weather.

01:10:04.089 --> 01:10:05.757
We meet them there.

01:10:10.345 --> 01:10:12.118
Of course, that's for morale.

01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:15.976
Missiles only take
5 minutes to get here.

01:10:19.729 --> 01:10:23.483
The President has
asked Jackie and the children
to come back from the country

01:10:23.483 --> 01:10:25.047
and be with him.

01:10:27.028 --> 01:10:29.114
You know those pictures
upstairs?

01:10:29.531 --> 01:10:31.199
Pictures of Lincoln?

01:10:32.972 --> 01:10:35.578
He looked so old near the end.

01:10:37.247 --> 01:10:38.706
When we got here,
I said,

01:10:38.811 --> 01:10:41.000
"It's not gonna
happen to us."

01:10:41.834 --> 01:10:43.711
We were too young.

01:10:45.171 --> 01:10:46.944
Why don't you go home tonight?

01:10:48.612 --> 01:10:50.176
Go on home.

01:10:51.323 --> 01:10:54.451
No. It's too much trouble
to get the car.

01:10:54.868 --> 01:10:57.162
Ken, we can get your car
in 15 minutes.

01:10:58.100 --> 01:10:59.769
- No.
- Go ahead.

01:11:00.394 --> 01:11:01.646
No.

01:11:02.167 --> 01:11:03.731
I'll let her sleep.

01:11:06.233 --> 01:11:07.485
I'll let 'em sleep.

01:11:08.423 --> 01:11:11.760
<i>It almost seemed today
as if time stood still.</i>

01:11:11.864 --> 01:11:13.636
<i>The shooting
hadn't started yet,</i>

01:11:13.741 --> 01:11:15.826
<i>but there weren't any
really encouraging signs</i>

01:11:16.035 --> 01:11:17.077
<i>that it could be avoided,</i>

01:11:17.912 --> 01:11:21.457
<i>but worried, alarmed,
afraid, perhaps even,</i>

01:11:21.665 --> 01:11:23.438
<i>the American public,
nonetheless,</i>

01:11:23.542 --> 01:11:25.836
<i>appeared determined and resolved.</i>

01:11:26.879 --> 01:11:28.547
<i>This is Walter Cronkite.</i>

01:11:29.068 --> 01:11:30.424
<i>Good night.</i>

01:12:11.402 --> 01:12:12.549
Paper?

01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:16.615
- Yeah, thanks.
- Here you go, sir.

01:13:16.466 --> 01:13:18.342
Gentlemen, can you hear me?

01:13:19.072 --> 01:13:20.324
Yes, we can hear you fine.

01:13:20.532 --> 01:13:22.826
I've got one minute
till 10:00 here.

01:13:23.347 --> 01:13:25.954
<i>The quarantine commences
in one minute.</i>

01:13:32.315 --> 01:13:33.670
And no sign of them stopping.

01:13:50.249 --> 01:13:51.500
Sir.

01:13:59.737 --> 01:14:01.510
Quarantine is now in effect.

01:14:02.031 --> 01:14:03.908
And it looks like
our first customers

01:14:04.012 --> 01:14:06.411
are the Gagarin and Kimovsk.

01:14:26.222 --> 01:14:28.724
Chief, I've got something
at zero-three-zero.

01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:32.478
X.O., take a look at this.

01:14:35.919 --> 01:14:37.691
New contact, Skipper.

01:14:44.782 --> 01:14:46.033
What do we got?

01:14:46.033 --> 01:14:47.388
A Russian sub.

01:14:50.412 --> 01:14:51.768
General Quarters,
General Quarters!

01:14:51.872 --> 01:14:53.853
All hands
man your battle stations!

01:14:53.957 --> 01:14:55.104
<i>General Quarters,
General Quarters!</i>

01:14:55.209 --> 01:14:56.668
<i>All hands,
man your battle stations!</i>

01:14:56.773 --> 01:14:57.920
<i>General Quarters,
General Quarters!</i>

01:14:58.128 --> 01:15:00.631
<i>All hands,
man your battle stations!</i>

01:15:04.384 --> 01:15:07.512
Bracket 231 correlates to
our submarine at 9,000 yards.

01:15:12.726 --> 01:15:14.915
It's protecting the freighters.

01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:25.342
Bob, is there any way

01:15:25.551 --> 01:15:27.845
we can avoid stopping
a submarine first?

01:15:27.949 --> 01:15:29.826
I'm afraid not, Mr. President.

01:15:29.826 --> 01:15:32.537
The sub has positioned itself
between the Pierce
and the Soviet ships.

01:15:33.163 --> 01:15:35.039
<i>Admiral Anderson insists
it's too much of a risk</i>

01:15:35.144 --> 01:15:36.603
<i>to proceed with stopping
the freighters.</i>

01:15:36.708 --> 01:15:39.314
<i>The Pierce would be
a sitting duck for the sub.</i>

01:15:40.774 --> 01:15:42.651
<i>- Put me through to the Pierce.
- Yes, sir.</i>

01:15:42.755 --> 01:15:44.424
Admiral Anderson!

01:15:44.424 --> 01:15:47.135
The President wishes
to speak directly to
the Captain of the Pierce.

01:15:48.386 --> 01:15:49.637
Is that a problem?

01:15:49.950 --> 01:15:51.514
No, it isn't, sir.

01:15:52.557 --> 01:15:53.808
He's putting you through, sir.

01:15:54.225 --> 01:15:56.519
<i>Sir, I'm patching you
through to the bridge now.</i>

01:15:58.500 --> 01:15:59.647
This is the Captain
of the Pierce.

01:16:00.273 --> 01:16:01.524
Captain, this is
the President speaking.

01:16:02.566 --> 01:16:03.713
Mr. President.

01:16:03.818 --> 01:16:04.756
<i>Is there any way</i>

01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:08.093
you can force that sub
to the surface without
damaging it or yourself?

01:16:08.405 --> 01:16:10.282
I can bring it up, Mr. President,

01:16:10.387 --> 01:16:13.202
but whether it's damaged
or not is up to the sub.

01:16:13.515 --> 01:16:15.287
Even if they do force it up,

01:16:15.392 --> 01:16:18.207
that sub will be inspected
over the crew's dead bodies.

01:16:18.311 --> 01:16:21.126
They'd be executed for
allowing it when they got home.

01:16:33.847 --> 01:16:35.307
Captain, force the sub
to the surface.

01:16:35.411 --> 01:16:36.558
<i>Yes, Mr. President.</i>

01:16:38.539 --> 01:16:41.250
- Prepare to fire torpedoes.
- Prepare to fire torpedoes.
Aye, sir.

01:16:41.355 --> 01:16:43.753
- Prepare to launch ASROC.
- Prepare to launch ASROC.
Aye, sir.

01:16:53.033 --> 01:16:54.284
Watch your fingers!

01:16:54.388 --> 01:16:55.639
Watch your fingers.

01:17:13.887 --> 01:17:15.138
What are they up to?

01:17:17.536 --> 01:17:19.100
They're slowing down.

01:17:27.650 --> 01:17:29.214
Mr. Secretary,

01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:33.385
I'm receiving reports.
The Russian ships appear
to be stopping.

01:17:33.489 --> 01:17:34.323
Mr. President,

01:17:34.532 --> 01:17:36.617
<i>Reports are coming
in here to the Pentagon</i>

01:17:36.826 --> 01:17:38.703
<i>that the ships
appear to be stopping.</i>

01:17:38.807 --> 01:17:40.788
Captain, belay that order.
Belay that order!

01:17:40.892 --> 01:17:41.622
Hold your fire!

01:17:41.831 --> 01:17:43.916
- Bob, where's that coming from?
- One second, Mr. President.

01:17:44.125 --> 01:17:46.836
Somebody find out
what's going on.

01:17:49.651 --> 01:17:51.841
Those ships
are definitely stopping.

01:17:53.926 --> 01:17:55.073
Some are turning around.

01:17:58.097 --> 01:17:59.139
Are they stopping?

01:17:59.244 --> 01:18:00.182
I don't know what
the hell they're doing.

01:18:00.391 --> 01:18:03.206
Admiral. Admiral,
what's happening!

01:18:03.310 --> 01:18:05.604
Yes, sir, they are stopping.

01:18:06.647 --> 01:18:08.315
Mr. President,

01:18:08.315 --> 01:18:10.296
reports are coming in
from all around.

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:12.590
The ships are stopping.

01:18:13.216 --> 01:18:14.988
Some are turning around.

01:18:15.197 --> 01:18:17.595
Some are turning around.

01:18:27.292 --> 01:18:28.439
We were eyeball to eyeball,

01:18:28.543 --> 01:18:30.107
and I think
the other fella just blinked.

01:18:47.729 --> 01:18:48.876
Yes, sir.

01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:50.231
Yes, sir.
We have that information.

01:18:50.336 --> 01:18:53.151
Mr. President.
Mr. President, sir.

01:18:53.464 --> 01:18:55.653
We have the tally from NSA.

01:18:55.758 --> 01:18:58.469
We have 20 ships stopping
and /or turning around.

01:18:58.573 --> 01:19:01.075
6, however, appear to be
continuing for the line.

01:19:05.038 --> 01:19:07.540
It's a, uh, it's a mistake.

01:19:07.749 --> 01:19:10.772
They must not have gotten
their orders yet. I'd-let 'em go.

01:19:10.877 --> 01:19:12.649
No. That's unlikely, Bobby.

01:19:12.753 --> 01:19:14.213
We' ve been monitoring
the radio transmissions

01:19:14.422 --> 01:19:16.611
from the Gagarin and the Kimovsk.

01:19:16.716 --> 01:19:19.114
Their radios are working
just fine, Mr. President.

01:19:19.218 --> 01:19:22.346
One ship, an accident maybe.

01:19:22.555 --> 01:19:24.953
6, Mr. President?
This is intentional.

01:19:25.057 --> 01:19:26.308
<i>Mr. President, let 'em go.</i>

01:19:26.413 --> 01:19:27.560
Oh, you're still here, Bob?

01:19:27.664 --> 01:19:29.541
<i>4 of the 6 continuing ships</i>

01:19:29.645 --> 01:19:31.209
<i>are still a day
away from the line.</i>

01:19:31.522 --> 01:19:34.233
They've stopped the ones
we suspect have weapons aboard.

01:19:34.233 --> 01:19:37.048
We'd look pretty bad shooting up
a freighter full of baby food.

01:19:37.361 --> 01:19:39.134
We sure as shit would.

01:19:41.115 --> 01:19:43.617
Captain, I want you to maintain
contact with those ships

01:19:43.617 --> 01:19:46.954
and do nothing until I order
otherwise. Is that clear?

01:19:47.058 --> 01:19:48.413
Yes, Mr. President.

01:19:48.622 --> 01:19:49.978
Contact only.

01:19:56.859 --> 01:19:59.049
<i>At its beginning,
this day looked</i>

01:19:59.153 --> 01:20:01.864
<i>as though it might be
one of armed conflict</i>

01:20:01.968 --> 01:20:04.888
<i>between Soviet vessels
and American warships</i>

01:20:04.992 --> 01:20:07.286
<i>on the sea lanes leading to Cuba.</i>

01:20:07.390 --> 01:20:09.893
Find out how close
our exercises are coming

01:20:09.997 --> 01:20:11.978
to their anti-ship missiles.

01:20:37.107 --> 01:20:37.941
God damn it!

01:20:38.046 --> 01:20:39.714
How the goddamn hell
did this happen?

01:20:39.714 --> 01:20:42.216
I'm gonna have Powers' head
on a platter...

01:20:42.216 --> 01:20:43.885
Next to LeMay's.

01:20:44.406 --> 01:20:47.013
Kenny, you hear me give the order
to go to DEFCON 2?

01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:49.411
Because I remember giving the order
to go to DEFCON 3,

01:20:49.515 --> 01:20:51.913
but I must be
suffering from amnesia.

01:20:52.852 --> 01:20:56.084
I've just been informed
our nuclear forces are at DEFCON 2.

01:20:56.397 --> 01:20:57.857
They were limited, Mr. President.

01:20:57.857 --> 01:21:00.359
- The orders were limited
to our strategic forces...
- Max!

01:21:00.568 --> 01:21:02.653
...in the continental United States.

01:21:02.862 --> 01:21:04.321
General LeMay is correct.

01:21:04.321 --> 01:21:06.824
Technically, SAC has
the statutory authority—

01:21:07.032 --> 01:21:08.701
I have the authority!

01:21:09.326 --> 01:21:11.203
I am the Commander in Chief
of the United States,

01:21:11.308 --> 01:21:14.123
and I say when we go to war.

01:21:15.583 --> 01:21:18.189
We're not at war, sir—
Not until DEFCON one.

01:21:23.403 --> 01:21:26.218
General, the Joint Chiefs

01:21:26.218 --> 01:21:29.346
have just signaled our intent
to escalate to the Soviets.

01:21:29.867 --> 01:21:32.370
You signaled an escalation
which I had no wish to signal,

01:21:32.474 --> 01:21:33.725
and which I did not approve.

01:21:35.811 --> 01:21:37.896
Just get out of here, Max.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.356
Yes, sir.

01:21:47.906 --> 01:21:49.991
Rescind the order.
Can all the Chiefs.

01:21:50.096 --> 01:21:52.077
Put Nitze, Gilpatrick and
the Under Secretaries in charge.

01:21:52.181 --> 01:21:53.537
- Can't do that, Bobby.
- Yes, we can.

01:21:53.641 --> 01:21:55.413
We can't fire the Chiefs, Bobby.

01:21:55.622 --> 01:21:57.603
Our invasion talk
would look like a bluff.

01:21:58.541 --> 01:22:00.940
Or even worse, that
there's been an attempted coup.

01:22:04.902 --> 01:22:06.049
Jesus.

01:22:13.869 --> 01:22:15.225
Kenny, give me...

01:22:15.433 --> 01:22:16.789
a couple minutes
alone with Bobby, would you?

01:22:28.467 --> 01:22:31.282
Just—Just try this on
for size.

01:22:31.699 --> 01:22:33.263
We get a hold
of Walter Lippmann,

01:22:33.889 --> 01:22:35.766
And we leak the idea of

01:22:35.974 --> 01:22:38.059
pulling our Jupiter missiles
out of Turkey,

01:22:38.164 --> 01:22:40.875
and the Soviets pull
their missiles out of Cuba.

01:22:42.543 --> 01:22:43.794
Act through the U.N.!

01:22:44.003 --> 01:22:45.358
K and K must talk!

01:22:45.567 --> 01:22:47.339
End the arms race,
not the human race!

01:22:58.183 --> 01:22:59.226
Kenny.

01:22:59.226 --> 01:22:59.956
Mac.

01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:02.041
What did you think of
the Lippmann column this morning?

01:23:02.146 --> 01:23:03.293
I think it's a bad idea.

01:23:03.397 --> 01:23:05.169
Thank God. Look,
everybody's furious about it.

01:23:05.274 --> 01:23:07.776
We trade away our missiles in Turkey,
and we're dead, politically.

01:23:07.776 --> 01:23:08.819
You' ve got to stop it.

01:23:09.027 --> 01:23:11.321
We know it was Jack and Bobby's idea.
They leaked it to Lippmann.

01:23:11.530 --> 01:23:13.198
The military guys
are going ape—

01:23:13.407 --> 01:23:14.137
Then they should speak up.

01:23:14.345 --> 01:23:16.326
Christ, Ken,
it's not that easy.

01:23:16.431 --> 01:23:17.473
- It is.
- No, it isn't.

01:23:17.578 --> 01:23:18.829
They don't trust the people
who feel this way,

01:23:18.829 --> 01:23:20.914
but these people are right,
and the Kennedys are wrong.

01:23:20.914 --> 01:23:22.270
We need you to talk to them.

01:23:22.374 --> 01:23:23.417
They'll listen to you.

01:23:23.625 --> 01:23:25.398
Jack and Bobby are good men,
but it takes a certain—

01:23:25.502 --> 01:23:27.692
You mean the President
of the United States?

01:23:27.796 --> 01:23:28.630
And the Attorney General?

01:23:28.734 --> 01:23:30.507
Kenny, they are good men,
but it takes a certain character,

01:23:30.611 --> 01:23:32.279
moral toughness,
to stand up to the Soviets.

01:23:32.384 --> 01:23:33.739
You listen to me.

01:23:34.156 --> 01:23:37.076
You're in the White House
right now because of the Kennedys.

01:23:37.284 --> 01:23:40.100
Now, they may be wrong,
they make mistakes,

01:23:40.204 --> 01:23:42.185
but they are not weak.

01:23:42.289 --> 01:23:44.687
The weak ones are these people
who can't seem to speak
their own minds.

01:23:44.792 --> 01:23:45.834
You know I don't mean
that they're weak.

01:23:46.043 --> 01:23:47.816
No, they just lack
a moral toughness.

01:23:48.441 --> 01:23:50.527
Jesus Christ, Mac.

01:23:51.986 --> 01:23:55.323
You—You think I'll
play your Judas for you?

01:23:55.949 --> 01:23:57.304
You've never understood us,
your kind.

01:23:57.408 --> 01:23:59.911
We've been fighting
with each other our whole lives,

01:23:59.911 --> 01:24:01.371
but nobody plays us
off each other,

01:24:01.475 --> 01:24:04.707
and nobody ever, ever
gets between us!

01:24:06.063 --> 01:24:08.148
It's a goddamn
trial balloon, Kenny.

01:24:08.461 --> 01:24:10.755
Well, then somebody
better publicly deny it,

01:24:10.859 --> 01:24:13.466
'cause there's only one way
the world's gonna read this.

01:24:13.570 --> 01:24:16.594
We sell out one of our friends
for our own safety.

01:24:19.513 --> 01:24:21.077
Exactly.

01:24:22.224 --> 01:24:24.727
Jesus Christ,
they're just killing us.

01:24:25.144 --> 01:24:28.481
<i>...and enter into negotiations</i>

01:24:28.689 --> 01:24:31.400
<i>in order to normalize
this confrontation</i>

01:24:31.504 --> 01:24:33.694
<i>and avert the threat
of a World War.</i>

01:24:33.798 --> 01:24:35.988
What is it
that Sun Tzu says?

01:24:38.178 --> 01:24:41.410
War's a moral contest,
and they're won in the temples
before they're ever fought.

01:24:41.618 --> 01:24:44.121
<i>...this enormous danger
for all mankind</i>

01:24:45.789 --> 01:24:48.605
<i>which exist at this moment...</i>

01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:51.420
It's right here. It's right here.
This is where we turn it around.

01:24:51.628 --> 01:24:52.567
You call Adlai,

01:24:52.775 --> 01:24:54.339
you tell him to stick it
to this son of a bitch.

01:24:54.444 --> 01:24:57.780
<i>...diplomatic resolution.</i>

01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:02.577
<i>The U.S. Believes that
with their economic boycott,</i>

01:25:02.889 --> 01:25:04.766
<i>by pressuring other countries</i>

01:25:04.871 --> 01:25:06.852
<i>to cease trade with Cuba,</i>

01:25:07.477 --> 01:25:09.875
<i>we would surrender
due to hunger.</i>

01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:12.169
<i>How does it feel,
Mr. President,</i>

01:25:12.795 --> 01:25:15.089
<i>to be this heroic</i>

01:25:15.402 --> 01:25:18.113
<i>and force a country
to surrender...</i>

01:25:18.321 --> 01:25:19.364
Am I still on hold here?

01:25:19.677 --> 01:25:20.824
They're trying
to find him right now.

01:25:21.241 --> 01:25:23.952
Ken, Adlai's too weak.

01:25:24.056 --> 01:25:26.350
We have to convince Jack to
pull him. Get McCloy in there.

01:25:26.454 --> 01:25:28.227
You can't take him out
this late in the game, Bobby.

01:25:28.331 --> 01:25:30.416
Zorin will eat him alive.

01:25:30.729 --> 01:25:32.398
Then talk to your brother,
god damn it.

01:25:33.127 --> 01:25:35.734
The two of you don't need
my advice to get into trouble.

01:25:35.838 --> 01:25:37.507
What's gotten into you?

01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:43.659
Are you still sore about
this Lippmann thing?

01:25:43.763 --> 01:25:45.535
That's something your father
would have done right there.

01:25:51.375 --> 01:25:52.209
My father?

01:25:53.877 --> 01:25:55.545
I'm just trying to make a point.

01:25:55.650 --> 01:25:58.152
This idea is that fucking bad.

01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:04.095
Adlai can handle Zorin.
He knows the inning,
he knows the score.

01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:05.034
He better,

01:26:06.077 --> 01:26:08.475
because nobody believes
he's up to this—

01:26:08.892 --> 01:26:09.830
Nobody.

01:26:12.437 --> 01:26:13.480
<i>Yes?</i>

01:26:13.584 --> 01:26:14.627
<i>- Adlai?
- Yes.</i>

01:26:14.627 --> 01:26:16.399
It's Ken. How you doing?

01:26:16.503 --> 01:26:18.902
I'm busy, Ken.
What do you need?

01:26:19.006 --> 01:26:21.091
The President told me
to pass a word to you.

01:26:21.196 --> 01:26:22.134
Stick it to them.

01:26:22.447 --> 01:26:24.532
<i>Cuba together...</i>

01:26:24.636 --> 01:26:27.973
I hear you.
I'm glad it's you calling.

01:26:28.390 --> 01:26:29.850
L—I thought
it would be Bobby.

01:26:30.163 --> 01:26:32.769
Adlai, the world has
to know we're right.

01:26:33.708 --> 01:26:35.272
If we're gonna have a chance
at a political solution,

01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:37.357
we need international pressure.

01:26:38.817 --> 01:26:40.694
You got to be tough, Adlai.

01:26:41.528 --> 01:26:42.779
You need to find it, Buddy.

01:26:43.822 --> 01:26:45.386
<i>Well, if they're still sticking</i>

01:26:45.490 --> 01:26:47.263
to their stonewalling strategy,

01:26:47.367 --> 01:26:48.827
I'll get them.

01:26:49.244 --> 01:26:50.912
I'm an old political cat,
Kenny...

01:26:52.164 --> 01:26:54.249
<i>But I've got one life left.</i>

01:26:54.353 --> 01:26:55.396
I know you do.

01:26:56.126 --> 01:26:57.273
See you, Ken.

01:26:57.377 --> 01:27:01.235
<i>We'll be able to find together
a proper...</i>

01:27:01.339 --> 01:27:02.799
Bobby.

01:27:15.728 --> 01:27:17.292
We call upon the world

01:27:17.397 --> 01:27:20.629
to condemn this purely
American provocation.

01:27:21.984 --> 01:27:24.904
We, the people of Romania,

01:27:25.113 --> 01:27:27.198
are standing in solidarity

01:27:27.406 --> 01:27:31.682
with the people of
the Republic of Cuba
and the revolution

01:27:31.994 --> 01:27:35.644
in the face of this
American threat to world peace.

01:27:36.374 --> 01:27:38.250
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

01:27:45.237 --> 01:27:48.990
We're very glad that you could
join us, Mr. Stevenson.

01:27:52.848 --> 01:27:54.308
For the last 2 hours,

01:27:54.308 --> 01:27:59.000
the entire world here
is asking only questions.

01:28:01.085 --> 01:28:04.631
The United States
is pushing the entire world

01:28:04.735 --> 01:28:07.237
to the brink of catastrophe.

01:28:09.844 --> 01:28:12.972
The people of the whole world
want to know why.

01:28:16.622 --> 01:28:19.124
<i>We are told again and again</i>

01:28:19.228 --> 01:28:21.835
<i>about some
incontrovertible evidence</i>

01:28:21.939 --> 01:28:25.589
<i>of offensive weapons in Cuba...</i>

01:28:27.361 --> 01:28:32.783
<i>But no evidence
can be shown to us.</i>

01:28:36.746 --> 01:28:39.978
Perhaps your spy planes
are so secret

01:28:40.395 --> 01:28:42.689
that you are simply incapable

01:28:42.793 --> 01:28:46.755
<i>to present such evidence.
Some planes.</i>

01:28:46.860 --> 01:28:49.362
I make the call,
Adlai is out. McCloy goes in.

01:28:49.466 --> 01:28:50.613
Let's just hope
it doesn't come to that.

01:28:50.822 --> 01:28:53.533
<i>...simply don't have
such evidence.</i>

01:29:00.206 --> 01:29:04.168
Perhaps the United States
of America is simply mistaken.

01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:11.467
<i>Yes, the United States
of America</i>

01:29:11.571 --> 01:29:15.221
<i>does not have any facts in hands,
only falsifications.</i>

01:29:17.098 --> 01:29:18.557
John, get ready to send
your staffer in.

01:29:18.662 --> 01:29:20.017
He's gonna be coming out.

01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:27.108
The Chair recognizes
the representative from
the United States of America.

01:29:29.401 --> 01:29:32.634
Well, let me say something
to you, Mr. Ambassador.

01:29:33.468 --> 01:29:35.032
We do have the evidence.

01:29:35.241 --> 01:29:39.098
<i>We do have it, and it is clear
and incontrovertible.</i>

01:29:39.203 --> 01:29:41.497
<i>And let me say something else.</i>

01:29:41.705 --> 01:29:44.729
<i>Those weapons
must be taken out of Cuba.</i>

01:29:44.833 --> 01:29:46.919
<i>You, the Soviet Union,
have created this new danger...</i>

01:29:46.919 --> 01:29:48.066
Come on, Adlai.

01:29:48.170 --> 01:29:50.047
<i>Not the United States.</i>

01:29:51.089 --> 01:29:53.279
<i>Mr. Zorin, I remind you
that the other day</i>

01:29:53.383 --> 01:29:56.094
you did not deny
the existence of these weapons,

01:29:56.199 --> 01:29:59.744
but today, again,
if I have heard you correctly,

01:30:00.369 --> 01:30:02.976
you now say they do not exist.

01:30:09.441 --> 01:30:11.735
<i>All right, sir, let me
ask you one simple question.</i>

01:30:11.839 --> 01:30:13.924
Come on, Adlai,
don't let him off.

01:30:14.759 --> 01:30:16.323
<i>Do you, Ambassador Zorin,</i>

01:30:16.323 --> 01:30:19.763
deny that the USSR
has placed and is placing

01:30:19.868 --> 01:30:23.934
medium and intermediate-range
missiles in sites in Cuba?

01:30:24.039 --> 01:30:25.081
Yes or no?

01:30:25.185 --> 01:30:26.645
<i>Don't wait for the translation.</i>

01:30:26.854 --> 01:30:28.001
<i>Yes or no?</i>

01:30:28.209 --> 01:30:29.356
Yeah.

01:30:36.759 --> 01:30:39.679
I am not
in the American courtroom,

01:30:40.305 --> 01:30:44.475
and I do not wish to respond
to questions...

01:30:46.039 --> 01:30:51.253
questions that a prosecutor
would put to the defendant.

01:30:51.357 --> 01:30:52.295
You will get...

01:30:53.234 --> 01:30:55.319
all the answers
to your questions

01:30:55.424 --> 01:30:57.613
as this session progresses.

01:30:57.613 --> 01:31:00.324
You are in a courtroom
of world opinion right now,

01:31:00.428 --> 01:31:02.618
and you can answer yes or no.

01:31:02.722 --> 01:31:07.206
<i>You have denied they exist, and
I want to know if I have
understood you correctly.</i>

01:31:10.438 --> 01:31:13.358
<i>Continue—
Continue your statement.</i>

01:31:13.462 --> 01:31:15.547
You will get your answers
in due course.

01:31:15.756 --> 01:31:18.050
Don't worry. Don't worry.

01:31:21.804 --> 01:31:25.245
<i>I'm prepared to wait for my answer
until Hell freezes over,</i>

01:31:25.349 --> 01:31:27.121
<i>if that's what is needed.</i>

01:31:31.188 --> 01:31:32.335
John, I'll get back to you.

01:31:32.439 --> 01:31:35.046
<i>I'm also prepared to present
the evidence in this room</i>

01:31:35.463 --> 01:31:37.027
<i>proving that the Soviet Union</i>

01:31:37.235 --> 01:31:38.904
<i>has lied to the world.</i>

01:31:45.890 --> 01:31:49.122
If you have decided not
to continue your statement,

01:31:49.226 --> 01:31:53.501
the Chair recognizes
the representative from Chile.

01:31:53.501 --> 01:31:55.274
I yield my time on the floor

01:31:55.378 --> 01:31:57.359
to the representative
of the United States.

01:31:59.132 --> 01:32:01.322
Well, then,
ladies and gentlemen,

01:32:01.426 --> 01:32:03.928
since it appears we're going
to be here for a while,

01:32:04.554 --> 01:32:08.099
<i>shall we have a look at what
the Soviets are doing in Cuba?</i>

01:32:08.725 --> 01:32:11.019
May we have
the presentation, please?

01:32:11.644 --> 01:32:14.564
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you will observe
in photograph "a"...

01:32:15.189 --> 01:32:16.649
Yeah. Yeah.

01:32:18.318 --> 01:32:20.194
<i>...taken approximately
August 29...</i>

01:32:20.299 --> 01:32:21.863
Old Adlai had it
in him after all.

01:32:21.967 --> 01:32:24.157
Zorin must not have
gotten instructions.

01:32:24.261 --> 01:32:26.242
Somebody in their Foreign Ministry
is blowing it big time.

01:32:26.346 --> 01:32:29.891
<i>In photograph "b",
we have October 14th.
The photograph taken then...</i>

01:32:29.996 --> 01:32:30.830
Mr. President.

01:32:30.934 --> 01:32:32.707
<i>There are at least 3 missile sites
being constructed.</i>

01:32:32.915 --> 01:32:34.062
<i>There are bunkers...</i>

01:32:34.271 --> 01:32:36.148
The ship is called the Grozny.

01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:39.797
We lost track of it
yesterday at nightfall.

01:32:40.944 --> 01:32:44.281
We thought we gave it
plenty of room when we
moved the quarantine line back.

01:32:45.010 --> 01:32:46.992
We just reacquired it.

01:32:47.513 --> 01:32:48.868
It crossed the line
hours ago.

01:32:48.973 --> 01:32:51.371
<i>Well, how the hell do you
lose a goddamn tanker?</i>

01:32:51.475 --> 01:32:53.248
<i>What the hell's going on
over there?</i>

01:33:05.134 --> 01:33:06.698
Hail 'em again.

01:33:08.471 --> 01:33:10.661
I want you to try 'em again.

01:33:19.524 --> 01:33:20.671
We are kidding ourselves.

01:33:20.775 --> 01:33:22.756
New coordinates for the Pierce.

01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:26.718
Pierce coordinates,
25 degrees, 30 minutes north,

01:33:26.822 --> 01:33:29.012
78 degrees, 10 minutes west.

01:33:49.345 --> 01:33:50.492
Not responding, Chief.

01:33:50.596 --> 01:33:51.847
Tell the Skipper.

01:33:52.785 --> 01:33:53.828
They're not responding, sir.

01:33:54.141 --> 01:33:55.705
<i>General Quarters,
General Quarters!</i>

01:33:55.914 --> 01:33:57.582
<i>All hands,
man your battle stations.</i>

01:33:57.686 --> 01:34:00.189
<i>All hands,
man your battle stations.</i>

01:34:11.137 --> 01:34:13.118
Very well. Load your guns.

01:34:13.222 --> 01:34:14.369
Guns are loaded, sir.

01:34:15.725 --> 01:34:16.872
What was that, Admiral?

01:34:17.184 --> 01:34:20.000
We've been hailing the Grozny
for the last hour, Mr. Secretary.

01:34:20.521 --> 01:34:22.398
The Grozny refuses to stop.

01:34:22.606 --> 01:34:23.336
What are you doing?

01:34:24.796 --> 01:34:26.673
Carrying out our mission,
Mr. Secretary.

01:34:26.777 --> 01:34:28.445
Now, if you don't mind,
we're very busy right now.

01:34:28.550 --> 01:34:29.905
We need to be able
to do our jobs.

01:34:29.905 --> 01:34:33.138
Admiral, I asked you a question.

01:34:33.450 --> 01:34:36.683
We're going to follow
the rules of engagement—

01:34:36.787 --> 01:34:40.124
The rules of engagement
which the President has
approved and signed

01:34:40.228 --> 01:34:42.939
in his order of 23 October.

01:34:43.982 --> 01:34:45.233
Yes.

01:34:46.276 --> 01:34:47.944
Yes, you may proceed,
Captain.

01:34:48.257 --> 01:34:50.133
- Clear your guns.
- What?

01:34:53.366 --> 01:34:54.304
Damn it!

01:34:54.513 --> 01:34:55.660
- Stop that firing!
- What?

01:34:55.764 --> 01:34:57.537
Stop that firing!

01:34:57.954 --> 01:34:59.726
Cease fire. Cease fire!

01:34:59.831 --> 01:35:00.873
God help us.

01:35:04.366 --> 01:35:06.452
- The ship was firing star shells.
- What?

01:35:06.660 --> 01:35:08.954
Star shells! Flares,
Mr. Secretary.

01:35:09.163 --> 01:35:11.457
God damn it! I've got
a job to do here.

01:35:11.457 --> 01:35:13.959
Now, you've been camped out
out there since Monday night.

01:35:13.959 --> 01:35:16.566
You're tired, you're exhausted,
and you're making mistakes.

01:35:16.774 --> 01:35:19.381
You interfere with me and
you will get some of my men killed,

01:35:19.485 --> 01:35:21.779
and I will not allow that!

01:35:22.092 --> 01:35:23.760
Star shells.

01:35:23.969 --> 01:35:26.367
Get out of our way,
Mr. Secretary.

01:35:26.471 --> 01:35:27.827
The Navy's been
running blockades

01:35:27.931 --> 01:35:29.912
since the days
of John Paul Jones.

01:35:30.121 --> 01:35:31.476
I believe the President
made it clear

01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:34.917
that there will be no firing on ships
without his express permission.

01:35:35.126 --> 01:35:37.732
With all due respect,
Mr. Secretary,

01:35:37.837 --> 01:35:39.713
we were not firing on that ship.

01:35:39.818 --> 01:35:40.965
What the hell was that?

01:35:41.069 --> 01:35:43.363
Firing on a ship
means attacking a ship.

01:35:43.363 --> 01:35:45.448
We were not attacking
that ship.

01:35:45.448 --> 01:35:47.429
We were firing over it.

01:35:47.534 --> 01:35:50.662
That was not the President's
intention when he gave that order.

01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:53.164
What if the Soviets
don't see the distinction?

01:35:53.164 --> 01:35:55.875
What if they make
the same mistake I just made?

01:35:56.605 --> 01:35:59.837
There will be no firing anything
near any Soviet ships

01:36:00.046 --> 01:36:01.506
without my express permission.

01:36:01.714 --> 01:36:03.487
Now is that understood,
Admiral?

01:36:04.842 --> 01:36:05.781
Is it?!

01:36:08.492 --> 01:36:09.847
Yes, sir.

01:36:10.056 --> 01:36:11.828
And I will only issue
such instructions

01:36:11.933 --> 01:36:14.018
when ordered to
by the President.

01:36:16.833 --> 01:36:18.814
John Paul Jones!

01:36:19.649 --> 01:36:21.943
You don't understand a thing,
do you, Admiral?

01:36:22.151 --> 01:36:24.236
This isn't a blockade!

01:36:24.341 --> 01:36:27.677
This is language—
A new vocabulary

01:36:27.782 --> 01:36:30.076
the likes of which the world
has never seen.

01:36:30.180 --> 01:36:31.952
This is President Kennedy

01:36:32.161 --> 01:36:35.289
communicating
with Secretary Khrushchev.

01:36:47.593 --> 01:36:49.678
Well, who the hell
authorized this missile test?

01:36:49.782 --> 01:36:51.034
Who do you think?

01:36:51.138 --> 01:36:53.223
God knows what this is gonna
communicate to the Soviets.

01:36:53.328 --> 01:36:55.204
Communicate with the Soviets?

01:36:55.517 --> 01:36:57.498
We can't communicate
with the Pentagon,

01:36:57.603 --> 01:36:59.688
and it's just across
the goddamn river.

01:36:59.792 --> 01:37:01.669
LeMay must think
you're afraid of him.

01:37:02.086 --> 01:37:04.067
I'm not taking that bait.

01:37:04.484 --> 01:37:06.153
The right move here
is to move on.

01:37:10.219 --> 01:37:12.930
<i>The United States Destroyer
Joseph P. Kennedy...</i>

01:37:18.039 --> 01:37:19.082
<i>This is the point</i>

01:37:19.186 --> 01:37:21.272
<i>at which we are concerned</i>

01:37:21.376 --> 01:37:23.774
<i>that there
might be shooting</i>

01:37:23.878 --> 01:37:25.442
<i>among the ships at sea,</i>

01:37:25.547 --> 01:37:28.362
<i>the possibility that invasion
might have to be undertaken</i>

01:37:28.466 --> 01:37:31.177
<i>to assure that those bases
are eliminated.</i>

01:37:31.282 --> 01:37:33.263
<i>If invasion is undertaken,</i>

01:37:33.367 --> 01:37:35.557
<i>the Russians have said
that they would retaliate</i>

01:37:35.661 --> 01:37:37.433
<i>with rocket fire.</i>

01:37:37.538 --> 01:37:39.519
<i>We have said if there's
rocket fire from Cuba,</i>

01:37:39.623 --> 01:37:40.561
<i>we will retaliate,</i>

01:37:40.770 --> 01:37:43.898
<i>and there goes
the whole ballgame.</i>

01:37:44.002 --> 01:37:44.941
Kenny.

01:37:45.462 --> 01:37:46.818
What's this?

01:37:47.235 --> 01:37:48.799
Can anyone just
walk in here now?

01:37:48.903 --> 01:37:50.467
Ken, don't worry. I'm not
here to do an interview.

01:37:50.571 --> 01:37:52.761
Well, if you're looking
for a cup of sugar, John,
you got the wrong door.

01:37:52.865 --> 01:37:55.993
Kenny, we need to see
the President.

01:37:56.098 --> 01:37:57.245
Something's happened.

01:37:57.245 --> 01:37:59.956
<i>The point of the crisis...
This is the point at which...</i>

01:38:00.060 --> 01:38:02.667
I have lunch with him,
maybe once a month.

01:38:03.084 --> 01:38:05.273
The way he talks, he acts like
he knows Khrushchev personally,

01:38:05.378 --> 01:38:07.671
but he's never elaborated.

01:38:08.401 --> 01:38:10.487
I've used him as a source
in a couple of stories.

01:38:10.695 --> 01:38:12.781
The FBI has identified
this Alexander Fomin

01:38:12.885 --> 01:38:14.970
as the Soviet resident,

01:38:15.075 --> 01:38:18.724
um, the KGB equivalent
of one of our Station Chiefs.

01:38:18.933 --> 01:38:21.435
He's their highest-ranking
spy in this country,

01:38:21.539 --> 01:38:23.312
and he knows John's
a friend of mine.

01:38:23.416 --> 01:38:26.023
All the trademarks of
a back-channel overture.

01:38:26.127 --> 01:38:28.734
Yeah. Some back channel.

01:38:28.838 --> 01:38:32.383
ABC News guy, my goddamn
next-door neighbor.

01:38:34.677 --> 01:38:36.241
So they'll remove the missiles,

01:38:36.658 --> 01:38:39.578
and we'll pledge not to
invade Cuba or destabilize Castro

01:38:39.682 --> 01:38:41.872
or assist anyone
who plans in doing so.

01:38:46.251 --> 01:38:49.379
I think this may be our
first real message from Khrushchev.

01:38:49.483 --> 01:38:51.465
The alternative,
Mr. President, is that

01:38:51.569 --> 01:38:53.550
this could be a trap.

01:38:53.758 --> 01:38:55.531
Mm-hmm.
And how is that exactly?

01:38:56.052 --> 01:38:57.929
Dangle a settlement.

01:38:58.033 --> 01:39:00.015
Tie us down in negotiation.
We come up short.

01:39:01.474 --> 01:39:03.768
Why else would they
approach us this way?

01:39:03.873 --> 01:39:04.915
It's deniable.

01:39:05.332 --> 01:39:07.209
The Soviets have done
nothing but lie to us.

01:39:07.313 --> 01:39:08.460
This could just be
more of the same.

01:39:08.565 --> 01:39:11.380
That may be why Khrushchev's
introducing this guy.

01:39:12.006 --> 01:39:14.299
We've been burned
by his usual players
in the formal channels,

01:39:14.404 --> 01:39:17.740
so he brings in
an honest broker.

01:39:17.740 --> 01:39:19.513
That may be what
they want us to think.

01:39:20.243 --> 01:39:21.286
The truth is, Mr. President,

01:39:21.494 --> 01:39:24.205
we don't even really know
who Fomin speaks for.

01:39:24.518 --> 01:39:25.769
It could be Khrushchev.

01:39:25.873 --> 01:39:27.750
It could be some faction
of the Politburo

01:39:27.750 --> 01:39:30.983
or the KGB itself.
We just don't know.

01:39:31.295 --> 01:39:33.902
Oh, by the way, Scali,
your activities now fall under

01:39:34.006 --> 01:39:36.822
the secrecy codicils
of the National Security Act.

01:39:36.926 --> 01:39:39.533
Sorry, John. No Pulitzer.

01:39:41.618 --> 01:39:43.808
Mr. President,
we haven't much time.

01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:46.414
I'm scheduled to meet
with him again in 31/2 hours.

01:39:47.144 --> 01:39:49.230
So it seems
the question of the day is,

01:39:49.334 --> 01:39:51.211
is the offer legitimate?

01:39:52.149 --> 01:39:53.713
And if it is...

01:39:53.818 --> 01:39:55.590
Well, if it is,
we can't afford to ignore it.

01:39:57.675 --> 01:39:59.240
So, John...

01:40:00.282 --> 01:40:02.159
We'll have instructions
for you

01:40:02.368 --> 01:40:04.244
in a couple of hours.

01:40:04.244 --> 01:40:05.496
Thank you.

01:40:07.685 --> 01:40:09.041
Thank you, John.

01:40:11.022 --> 01:40:14.254
Sir, we don't have much time to
play out back-channel communiqués.

01:40:19.363 --> 01:40:20.510
Kenny.

01:40:23.534 --> 01:40:25.828
I need you to get over
to your old stomping grounds

01:40:25.932 --> 01:40:28.226
and go through everything
the FBI has on Fomin,

01:40:28.643 --> 01:40:30.625
And I need your best call—
Is the guy legit,

01:40:30.729 --> 01:40:32.189
and is he speaking
for Khrushchev?

01:40:33.127 --> 01:40:37.194
OK, so what we got here is
this guy Alexander Feklisov,
aka Alexander Fomin,

01:40:37.298 --> 01:40:39.383
declared Counsel
to the Soviet Embassy,

01:40:39.487 --> 01:40:42.407
but in reality
the KGB Papa spy.

01:40:43.658 --> 01:40:46.578
An illustrious tour of duty
during the Great Patriotic War

01:40:46.682 --> 01:40:48.767
gets him
on the Party fast track.

01:40:48.872 --> 01:40:51.895
Various tours of duty in KGB.

01:40:52.313 --> 01:40:54.398
American postings.
He's an expert on us,

01:40:54.502 --> 01:40:57.422
and that is all that
we got on Papa spy.

01:41:01.384 --> 01:41:04.303
How do you become the KGB
top spy in the United States?

01:41:04.721 --> 01:41:06.180
You gotta know someone.

01:41:07.327 --> 01:41:09.204
You gotta know someone.

01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:12.958
So, politics is politics.

01:41:24.949 --> 01:41:26.617
Walter, get me
Khrushchev's files.

01:41:27.660 --> 01:41:28.598
Pass me that.

01:41:28.702 --> 01:41:31.726
I want to see their career
chronology side by side.

01:41:32.978 --> 01:41:35.689
- We know they're not related, right?
- Right.

01:41:35.793 --> 01:41:38.191
They're not from
the same hometown.

01:41:38.295 --> 01:41:39.546
They went
to different schools.

01:41:39.546 --> 01:41:40.798
Right.

01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:43.822
So if they were gonna meet,

01:41:44.239 --> 01:41:46.011
they should have met here.

01:41:46.115 --> 01:41:47.158
I think they could have met.

01:41:47.262 --> 01:41:48.722
They couldn't have.

01:41:49.035 --> 01:41:52.059
He was an engineer stationed
outside of Moscow
at the end of '41.

01:41:54.457 --> 01:41:55.917
That's it.

01:41:56.855 --> 01:41:59.879
They know each other.
They're war buddies.

01:41:59.983 --> 01:42:01.443
That's pretty thin, Kenny.

01:42:01.652 --> 01:42:04.154
Well, real life
usually is, Walter.

01:42:06.239 --> 01:42:07.908
They know each other, Jack.

01:42:08.116 --> 01:42:09.889
Khrushchev and Fomin
were war buddies.

01:42:09.993 --> 01:42:10.932
You sure?

01:42:11.036 --> 01:42:12.496
<i>Don't take it to court,
but we've got</i>

01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:14.164
good circumstantial evidence.

01:42:14.268 --> 01:42:17.083
Well, you're there. I mean,
what's your instinct?
I gotta move on this.

01:42:20.420 --> 01:42:21.984
My gut's telling me
that Khrushchev's turning

01:42:22.088 --> 01:42:24.487
to a trusted old friend
to carry his message.

01:42:26.885 --> 01:42:28.136
OK. We're going.

01:42:30.638 --> 01:42:31.890
I've been instructed
to tell you

01:42:31.994 --> 01:42:34.288
that the American Government
would respond favorably

01:42:34.392 --> 01:42:37.207
to an offer along the lines
that you have discussed.

01:42:37.624 --> 01:42:40.648
If such a solution were raised
at the U.N. By Ambassador Zorin,

01:42:41.065 --> 01:42:44.506
he would find a favorable reply
from Ambassador Stevenson.

01:42:45.132 --> 01:42:47.426
So, I understand you correctly.

01:42:48.573 --> 01:42:52.118
If the missiles in Cuba
were dismantled,

01:42:52.222 --> 01:42:54.203
returned to the Soviet Union

01:42:54.307 --> 01:42:57.018
and a guarantee was made
not to reintroduce them,

01:42:57.123 --> 01:42:59.000
the United States
would be prepared

01:42:59.104 --> 01:43:02.336
to guarantee that
it would never invade Cuba?

01:43:02.336 --> 01:43:04.005
That is correct.

01:43:04.213 --> 01:43:05.881
And this is from
the Highest Authority?

01:43:05.986 --> 01:43:07.341
Yes, the Highest Authority.

01:43:09.218 --> 01:43:10.782
There are 2 conditions.

01:43:10.886 --> 01:43:14.223
The U.N. Must be allowed to inspect
the removal of the missiles.

01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:16.830
Of course, the U.N.
Must also be allowed

01:43:16.934 --> 01:43:18.498
to observe the redeployment

01:43:18.602 --> 01:43:20.583
of forces from
the American Southeast.

01:43:20.688 --> 01:43:22.147
I can't speak to that.

01:43:23.816 --> 01:43:25.484
What's the second
condition, John?

01:43:26.214 --> 01:43:27.569
Time is of the essence.

01:43:27.674 --> 01:43:29.029
How much time?

01:43:29.133 --> 01:43:30.072
48 hours.

01:43:30.593 --> 01:43:33.930
In 48 hours,
there can be no deals.

01:43:34.243 --> 01:43:35.807
Hoo hoo.

01:43:37.058 --> 01:43:38.101
I'll see what I can do.

01:43:55.931 --> 01:43:58.642
I think it's very difficult to
make a decision from this document.

01:43:58.642 --> 01:44:00.936
Well, it looks to me like
Fomin's overture was genuine.

01:44:01.144 --> 01:44:02.500
That's a big "if," Bobby.

01:44:02.604 --> 01:44:04.168
It's 10 pages
of sentimental fluff,

01:44:04.272 --> 01:44:06.149
but he's saying it right here.

01:44:06.149 --> 01:44:07.400
He'll remove the missiles

01:44:07.504 --> 01:44:09.381
in return for
a no-invasion pledge.

01:44:09.486 --> 01:44:11.988
Mm-hmm. Mr. President,
our early analysis says

01:44:12.092 --> 01:44:15.116
this probably was written
by Khrushchev himself.

01:44:15.220 --> 01:44:16.784
It's a first draft.
It shows no signs

01:44:16.993 --> 01:44:19.183
of being polished
by the Foreign Ministry.

01:44:19.391 --> 01:44:21.268
In fact, it probably wasn't
even approved by the Politburo

01:44:21.372 --> 01:44:23.875
as they wouldn't let
the emotionalism go by.

01:44:24.188 --> 01:44:26.064
The analysts say it
was written by someone

01:44:26.169 --> 01:44:28.358
under considerable stress.

01:44:29.610 --> 01:44:31.382
Glad to know we're not alone.

01:44:34.510 --> 01:44:37.638
Well, it never was my intention
to invade Cuba anyway...

01:44:38.055 --> 01:44:39.932
Until they put
the missiles in there.

01:44:42.018 --> 01:44:43.060
Gentlemen, I think

01:44:43.165 --> 01:44:46.397
we should
seriously consider this deal.

01:45:20.493 --> 01:45:22.474
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:45:23.308 --> 01:45:25.394
You look old, O'Donnell.

01:45:26.436 --> 01:45:27.792
You don't.

01:45:28.417 --> 01:45:30.294
It's 2:30 in the morning.

01:45:30.816 --> 01:45:32.588
You flirting with me?

01:45:34.778 --> 01:45:37.593
We got a back-channel communication
from Khrushchev this evening,

01:45:37.697 --> 01:45:39.887
feeling us out about a deal.

01:45:40.617 --> 01:45:41.972
He confirmed it

01:45:42.077 --> 01:45:43.432
just a little while ago
in a letter.

01:45:44.579 --> 01:45:46.247
Thank God.

01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:50.001
Jack kicked us out of
his house for the night.

01:45:51.044 --> 01:45:52.608
Darn it.

01:45:52.816 --> 01:45:54.693
For a second there,
I thought you'd been fired.

01:45:55.632 --> 01:45:57.196
No such luck.

01:46:03.973 --> 01:46:05.954
You know,
I'm driving home...

01:46:07.831 --> 01:46:10.229
there was something
I wanted to tell you.

01:46:18.154 --> 01:46:20.031
Finish that thought.

01:46:23.784 --> 01:46:24.618
Yes?

01:46:24.723 --> 01:46:27.329
<i>Kenny, it's Bob. We're getting
another letter over the teletype</i>

01:46:27.434 --> 01:46:29.415
<i>from Khrushchev.
I have a bad feeling.</i>

01:46:29.519 --> 01:46:31.187
Ok, I'll be right there.

01:46:38.069 --> 01:46:39.633
You're beautiful.

01:46:46.202 --> 01:46:48.183
It looks like Fomin
was a ploy after all,

01:46:48.288 --> 01:46:50.581
and they were just
stalling for time.

01:46:57.568 --> 01:46:58.610
It gets worse.

01:47:00.174 --> 01:47:03.511
Gentlemen,
my specialists are in agreement.

01:47:03.928 --> 01:47:05.701
This morning's letter
is not Khrushchev.

01:47:05.805 --> 01:47:07.682
Last night's letter was.

01:47:07.994 --> 01:47:10.080
The evidence supports
only one conclusion.

01:47:10.288 --> 01:47:13.312
There's been a coup, and
Khrushchev was replaced overnight.

01:47:13.834 --> 01:47:14.772
Dean?

01:47:14.876 --> 01:47:16.232
At the very least,
it does suggest

01:47:16.336 --> 01:47:18.630
he's been co-opted
by hard-line elements.

01:47:18.838 --> 01:47:21.028
Which at the end of the day,
amounts to the same thing.

01:47:21.132 --> 01:47:22.384
A puppet Khrushchev

01:47:22.488 --> 01:47:25.199
and a hard-line Soviet Government
pulling the strings.

01:47:25.303 --> 01:47:28.118
No deal, and the missiles
are almost operational.

01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:31.559
What if the Soviets
have no intention of
honoring this second deal?

01:47:31.664 --> 01:47:33.645
Then tomorrow,
they make another condition.

01:47:33.645 --> 01:47:36.460
Meanwhile,
the quarantine isn't working,

01:47:36.564 --> 01:47:38.858
and they're completing work
on the missile sites.

01:47:39.901 --> 01:47:43.237
Sir, I think we have to issue
pre-invasion orders for our forces.

01:47:43.759 --> 01:47:45.323
Mr. President,

01:47:45.740 --> 01:47:47.200
this morning's
photography is in.

01:47:48.242 --> 01:47:50.015
It appears the Soviets
have commenced

01:47:50.119 --> 01:47:52.205
a crash program
to ready their missiles.

01:47:52.517 --> 01:47:55.541
The first missiles became
operational last night.

01:47:55.958 --> 01:47:58.565
We expect they'll all
be operational in 36 hours.

01:47:58.669 --> 01:48:00.859
Then we're out of time.
We have to go in.

01:48:00.963 --> 01:48:03.049
That may not be as easy
as we thought, either.

01:48:03.153 --> 01:48:04.300
We have gotten confirmation

01:48:04.404 --> 01:48:05.655
the Soviets
have also deployed

01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:07.636
battlefield
nuclear weapons to Cuba.

01:48:07.845 --> 01:48:11.599
FROGs, we call 'em.
Short-range tactical nukes.

01:48:11.911 --> 01:48:13.788
Now, we don't know
whether they've delegated

01:48:13.893 --> 01:48:15.874
release authority
to their local commanders

01:48:16.082 --> 01:48:17.959
for use on
our invasion troops,

01:48:18.063 --> 01:48:19.210
but the good news is,

01:48:19.315 --> 01:48:21.608
as of this moment,
we know where the FROGs are,

01:48:21.713 --> 01:48:23.277
and we can target them, too.

01:48:24.632 --> 01:48:26.092
But the longer we wait,

01:48:26.092 --> 01:48:28.177
the harder it's going to get.

01:48:44.548 --> 01:48:46.007
We have no choice.

01:48:51.012 --> 01:48:52.994
General,
issue orders to our forces

01:48:53.098 --> 01:48:56.122
to be prepared to execute
the air strikes Monday morning.

01:48:56.851 --> 01:48:58.520
And the follow-on invasion

01:48:58.624 --> 01:48:59.980
according to
the schedule thereafter.

01:49:01.439 --> 01:49:04.255
I'll need
the official release orders
on my desk on Sunday night.

01:49:04.359 --> 01:49:05.402
Understood, sir.

01:49:06.444 --> 01:49:08.321
We'll need to step up
our overflights,

01:49:08.425 --> 01:49:10.928
finalize our pilots'
target folders

01:49:10.928 --> 01:49:12.492
in order to carry out
the strikes.

01:49:13.952 --> 01:49:16.037
- Permission granted.
- Yes, sir.

01:49:27.090 --> 01:49:28.549
Well, gentlemen,

01:49:28.549 --> 01:49:31.260
if anybody's got
any great ideas, now's the time.

01:49:40.436 --> 01:49:42.521
Major Anderson, there's
a phone call for you.

01:49:42.626 --> 01:49:43.564
Thank you.

01:49:43.668 --> 01:49:46.484
All right. Give me
just a second here, guys.

01:49:50.237 --> 01:49:52.218
This is Major Anderson.

01:49:53.470 --> 01:49:54.304
<i>Hello?</i>

01:49:54.617 --> 01:49:55.659
<i>Hello, anyone there?</i>

01:49:55.764 --> 01:49:57.328
<i>- Major?
- Yes, sir?</i>

01:49:57.745 --> 01:50:00.560
My name is Kenneth O'Donnell,
Special Assistant to the President.

01:50:02.228 --> 01:50:04.001
<i>Major, a few days ago,
the President ordered me</i>

01:50:04.105 --> 01:50:05.565
to help him keep control

01:50:05.669 --> 01:50:07.546
of what's going on out there.

01:50:08.484 --> 01:50:11.404
I've been—I've been
browbeating pilots,

01:50:11.508 --> 01:50:13.802
you know, Navy guys
left and right

01:50:13.906 --> 01:50:16.305
to make sure you don't get us
here in Washington into trouble.

01:50:17.556 --> 01:50:19.016
<i>But you know what?</i>

01:50:20.684 --> 01:50:23.082
We're pretty damn good ourselves
at getting into trouble,

01:50:23.186 --> 01:50:25.167
so instead of
riding your ass,

01:50:25.376 --> 01:50:29.025
I'm just gonna tell you
what's going on here
and let you figure out

01:50:29.130 --> 01:50:31.007
<i>how best to help us out up here.</i>

01:50:31.111 --> 01:50:32.466
Go ahead, sir.

01:50:33.196 --> 01:50:34.865
<i>Last night, it, uh...</i>

01:50:35.282 --> 01:50:38.305
<i>Iooked like we were
going to cut a deal to
get us all out of this mess.</i>

01:50:39.035 --> 01:50:41.225
Today, the Soviets
are reneging.

01:50:42.059 --> 01:50:45.187
We're gonna try and
salvage the situation, but

01:50:45.709 --> 01:50:47.898
a lot of things
are going wrong today.

01:50:48.628 --> 01:50:50.609
<i>It's making everyone nervous.</i>

01:50:51.548 --> 01:50:52.486
<i>And when things go wrong,</i>

01:50:52.590 --> 01:50:54.154
<i>people will become
more nervous,</i>

01:50:54.259 --> 01:50:57.595
and it will be very hard
to avoid going to war.

01:50:59.576 --> 01:51:01.662
I'm not sure what you're
tying to tell me, sir.

01:51:01.870 --> 01:51:04.373
<i>Just my standard line</i>

01:51:04.477 --> 01:51:07.292
I've been repeating
to guys like you all week.

01:51:08.231 --> 01:51:10.108
Don't get shot down.

01:51:11.984 --> 01:51:15.947
Beyond that, whatever else
you can do to help us
I'd appreciate it.

01:51:15.947 --> 01:51:17.198
Sir...

01:51:20.534 --> 01:51:21.994
When you're at 72,000 feet,

01:51:22.098 --> 01:51:24.392
there's a million things
that can go wrong. I mean,

01:51:25.956 --> 01:51:28.876
<i>Is your oxygen mix right?
Are your cameras gonna freeze up?</i>

01:51:28.980 --> 01:51:31.587
<i>Are you leaving a contrail?
Those million things,</i>

01:51:31.796 --> 01:51:34.089
<i>they're beyond
your control mostly.</i>

01:51:34.402 --> 01:51:35.653
<i>But...</i>

01:51:37.322 --> 01:51:39.199
<i>You know,
when you realize that,</i>

01:51:39.303 --> 01:51:42.118
<i>there's a kind of peace,
you know?</i>

01:51:42.222 --> 01:51:44.933
If you're a good man and
if your ground crew are good men,

01:51:45.142 --> 01:51:46.706
that is all you can ask for.

01:51:46.810 --> 01:51:48.896
With the grace of God,
that'll get you through.

01:51:50.251 --> 01:51:52.024
Are you a religious man?

01:51:52.441 --> 01:51:53.796
Yes, sir, I am.

01:51:56.299 --> 01:51:57.654
Good.

01:54:22.067 --> 01:54:23.423
The plane is missing, Kenny.

01:54:24.570 --> 01:54:27.072
We are presuming
the pilot is dead.

01:54:40.001 --> 01:54:41.565
Well, it's hard to believe,

01:54:41.670 --> 01:54:44.172
with the Soviet centralized
command structure,

01:54:44.276 --> 01:54:46.049
that this could've been
an accidental launch.

01:54:46.153 --> 01:54:48.030
The question is, does
this attack on our plane

01:54:48.030 --> 01:54:50.741
represent a definitive
intentional escalation

01:54:50.950 --> 01:54:52.201
on the part of the Soviets?

01:54:52.409 --> 01:54:53.765
Mr. President,

01:54:53.869 --> 01:54:55.850
taken with the events
of the past few hours,

01:54:55.955 --> 01:54:58.666
I believe this confirms
our worst fears.

01:54:58.770 --> 01:55:00.855
We're now dealing with
a hard-line Soviet Government,

01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:03.566
Perhaps with Khrushchev
as a puppet head, perhaps not.
We don't know.

01:55:03.671 --> 01:55:04.922
You OK?

01:55:05.130 --> 01:55:06.486
Yeah.

01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:08.258
I'm fine.

01:55:10.344 --> 01:55:11.491
Mr. President...

01:55:12.116 --> 01:55:12.950
What now?

01:55:13.055 --> 01:55:15.140
A U-2 on a routine
air-sampling mission

01:55:15.140 --> 01:55:17.747
got lost and penetrated
Soviet airspace over Siberia.

01:55:17.851 --> 01:55:19.415
Oh, God damn it!

01:55:19.519 --> 01:55:22.022
Soviets scrambled MIGs in pursuit,
thinking it was a bomber.

01:55:22.230 --> 01:55:23.482
Got out OK.

01:55:23.586 --> 01:55:25.046
Somebody forgot
to cancel the mission.

01:55:25.254 --> 01:55:27.861
You know, there's always
some son of a bitch who
doesn't get the word.

01:55:27.965 --> 01:55:29.946
You know, this is
just what we need.

01:55:30.468 --> 01:55:32.240
Soviets thinking
we're bombing them.

01:55:36.515 --> 01:55:37.662
Anybody else?

01:55:37.767 --> 01:55:39.331
Mr. President,

01:55:39.331 --> 01:55:41.624
our pilots are in danger.

01:55:41.624 --> 01:55:44.335
We must order punitive air strikes
against the SAM site

01:55:44.335 --> 01:55:45.691
that shot down Major Anderson

01:55:45.795 --> 01:55:47.985
per our rules of engagement.

01:56:04.251 --> 01:56:05.502
No.

01:56:06.858 --> 01:56:09.047
I want confirmation it wasn't
some sort of accident first.

01:56:09.152 --> 01:56:10.090
Mr. President.

01:56:10.194 --> 01:56:12.175
I think that's
a good idea, Mr. President.

01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:13.948
I can wait a day and a half.

01:56:14.365 --> 01:56:16.555
Be safer for my boys to
get the SAMs on Monday

01:56:16.659 --> 01:56:19.161
when we get the rest
of the bastards.

01:57:27.771 --> 01:57:30.169
Hut... hut!

01:57:33.610 --> 01:57:35.069
Yeah, yeah.

01:57:52.065 --> 01:57:53.212
Break!

01:58:11.147 --> 01:58:12.711
That's the quarter.

01:58:19.384 --> 01:58:21.156
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Sport.

01:58:21.261 --> 01:58:23.033
- You winning?
- Yeah.

01:58:24.702 --> 01:58:26.995
Is everything
gonna be OK, Dad?

01:58:29.185 --> 01:58:30.958
Everything's gonna
be fine, Kenny.

01:58:32.835 --> 01:58:35.337
I guess you won't
be coming home tonight.

01:58:39.716 --> 01:58:40.968
I, uh...

01:58:43.679 --> 01:58:44.930
l—

01:58:45.347 --> 01:58:48.058
Let's go!
Second quarter!

01:58:51.812 --> 01:58:53.793
It's OK. Go on back
to your game.

01:58:54.523 --> 01:58:55.669
All right.
I'll see you around, Dad.

01:58:59.319 --> 01:59:01.196
First down!

01:59:07.452 --> 01:59:08.807
Break!

01:59:28.514 --> 01:59:29.661
Damn it!

01:59:32.789 --> 01:59:33.936
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

01:59:34.041 --> 01:59:35.917
Take off for 2 hours,
you're gonna miss a little drama.

01:59:36.022 --> 01:59:38.524
I told you how stupid it was
to float that Lippmann article.

01:59:38.524 --> 01:59:39.775
Now you're gonna
do it for real?

01:59:39.880 --> 01:59:41.235
The Jupiters
are obsolete, Kenny.

01:59:41.339 --> 01:59:42.695
They were supposed
to have been dismantled—

01:59:42.799 --> 01:59:45.197
I know they're obsolete!
That's not the point.

01:59:46.031 --> 01:59:48.951
The point is, you trade
our missiles in Turkey
for theirs in Cuba,

01:59:49.055 --> 01:59:51.141
they're gonna force us
into trade after trade,

01:59:51.349 --> 01:59:53.330
until finally,
a couple of months from now,

01:59:53.330 --> 01:59:56.146
they demand something
we won't trade, like Berlin,

01:59:56.875 --> 01:59:58.961
and we do end up in a war.

01:59:59.274 --> 02:00:00.838
Not to mention that
long before that happens,

02:00:00.942 --> 02:00:03.132
this administration
will be politically dead.

02:00:03.340 --> 02:00:04.800
I don't care
if this administration

02:00:04.904 --> 02:00:06.260
ends up in the freaking toilet!

02:00:06.364 --> 02:00:08.345
We don't do a deal tonight,
there won't be any administration.

02:00:08.449 --> 02:00:09.701
It's the wrong move, Bobby,

02:00:09.805 --> 02:00:11.682
and it's not just me
who thinks that.

02:00:11.786 --> 02:00:15.227
Everyone on this
so-called EXCOM is telling
you exactly the same thing.

02:00:16.478 --> 02:00:18.146
Well, whose side
are you on now, Ken?

02:00:18.251 --> 02:00:21.066
Oh... God damn it.

02:00:23.568 --> 02:00:25.862
What if there hasn't
been a coup at all?

02:00:27.322 --> 02:00:29.199
What if it's you two?

02:00:29.825 --> 02:00:32.327
- What is that supposed to mean?
- What if it was you two

02:00:32.327 --> 02:00:36.289
who invited that second letter
by raising the possibility
of a trade?

02:00:43.171 --> 02:00:45.882
Mr. President, we have
only 30 hours left,

02:00:45.986 --> 02:00:47.342
and whatever response we send,

02:00:47.446 --> 02:00:49.114
it will take several
hours for the wire

02:00:49.219 --> 02:00:52.451
to be received by our Embassy
and delivered to the Kremlin.

02:00:52.868 --> 02:00:54.432
So we're looking at
early tomorrow morning

02:00:54.432 --> 02:00:56.726
at the earliest before
Khrushchev can respond.

02:00:58.186 --> 02:00:59.228
Which one of you geniuses

02:00:59.228 --> 02:01:01.001
is gonna tell me
how to explain it to the world

02:01:01.105 --> 02:01:02.044
if we don't make this trade?

02:01:04.650 --> 02:01:06.527
So, what are we gonna
say to the Soviets

02:01:07.049 --> 02:01:08.196
about this offer?

02:01:09.030 --> 02:01:11.115
Well, it depends,
doesn't it? I mean,

02:01:11.636 --> 02:01:14.035
Do we really believe
there's been a coup?

02:01:14.452 --> 02:01:16.746
What if Fomin wasn't a ploy?

02:01:17.058 --> 02:01:18.623
What if his message was real?

02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:22.376
What if what is happening
is a series of accidents?

02:01:22.480 --> 02:01:24.983
Accidents like them
shooting down our U-2?

02:01:27.173 --> 02:01:28.737
Yes, accidents like that.

02:01:28.841 --> 02:01:32.282
And the accident's
making the second letter
seem more aggressive

02:01:32.699 --> 02:01:35.201
and the whole situation
appear worse than it really is.

02:01:36.140 --> 02:01:38.434
- "The Guns of August".
- That's right.

02:01:38.955 --> 02:01:41.145
So we just reject
the second letter?

02:01:42.292 --> 02:01:44.168
No. No, no.

02:01:44.690 --> 02:01:46.045
We don't reject it.

02:01:46.150 --> 02:01:47.505
We accept the first letter

02:01:47.609 --> 02:01:50.320
and pretend the second
letter doesn't exist.

02:01:52.510 --> 02:01:54.491
It won't work because
that's wishful thinking!

02:01:54.595 --> 02:01:55.638
He made an offer, so l—

02:01:55.742 --> 02:01:57.828
That's the same
wishful thinking, Bobby,

02:01:57.828 --> 02:01:59.288
that blinded us
all these months

02:01:59.392 --> 02:02:02.416
while the Soviets were sneaking
those missiles in under our noses.

02:02:02.416 --> 02:02:03.771
Ignore the second letter,

02:02:03.875 --> 02:02:05.127
agree to the conditions
of the first.

02:02:05.335 --> 02:02:07.316
There's no reason to believe
the Soviets will let it go.

02:02:07.421 --> 02:02:09.923
Max is right.
Why will they accept it?

02:02:09.923 --> 02:02:11.800
It can work if—

02:02:11.904 --> 02:02:13.677
If they believe
we're gonna hit 'em,

02:02:13.781 --> 02:02:15.554
and hit 'em hard.
We've got time

02:02:15.658 --> 02:02:17.847
for one more round
of diplomacy, and that's it.

02:02:18.160 --> 02:02:20.141
The first air strikes
start in 28 hours.

02:02:20.246 --> 02:02:22.018
But we have to make
them agree to it.

02:02:22.018 --> 02:02:23.269
Right. So how do we do that?

02:02:23.374 --> 02:02:24.521
Well, we give them something.

02:02:24.729 --> 02:02:27.232
We tell 'em we're gonna remove
the missiles from Turkey—

02:02:27.232 --> 02:02:28.274
Hang on!

02:02:28.379 --> 02:02:29.838
But we do that
6 months from now,

02:02:29.943 --> 02:02:32.028
so it appears
there's no linkage.

02:02:32.237 --> 02:02:35.156
We also tell 'em if they go
public about it, we'll deny it.

02:02:35.365 --> 02:02:36.824
Right. We deny it.
The deal's off.

02:02:37.033 --> 02:02:39.535
And we do it under the table,
so we can disavow
any knowledge of it.

02:02:39.640 --> 02:02:42.038
It's transparent, Kenny.
The press'll be all over it.

02:02:42.142 --> 02:02:44.853
6 months from now, we're
not gonna care, are we?

02:02:45.270 --> 02:02:46.313
We'll deal with it then.

02:02:46.417 --> 02:02:49.545
At the least, it'll expose whether
Khrushchev has been overthrown.

02:02:49.650 --> 02:02:50.796
We'll know who
we're up against.

02:02:50.901 --> 02:02:52.361
Well, I've been thinking
about Khrushchev,

02:02:52.465 --> 02:02:54.133
and if this is
a move to appease

02:02:54.237 --> 02:02:56.010
the hard-liners
in his Government,

02:02:56.114 --> 02:02:57.783
then it may be
just the bone he needs

02:02:57.887 --> 02:02:59.347
to regain control
of his own house.

02:02:59.451 --> 02:03:02.683
Whoever carries the message
has to hit the nail on the head.

02:03:03.309 --> 02:03:05.603
Come across as too soft,
they'll push us.

02:03:05.811 --> 02:03:08.314
Too hard, they'll be cornered,
and even more dangerous.

02:03:08.314 --> 02:03:09.565
All of you—

02:03:09.773 --> 02:03:11.025
All of you do understand

02:03:11.025 --> 02:03:13.944
that there is an enormous risk
in offering this deal.

02:03:14.674 --> 02:03:16.655
Because if they turn us down,
and we've already told them

02:03:16.864 --> 02:03:18.324
that we're coming in
on Monday morning...

02:03:18.532 --> 02:03:20.617
- They'll strike first.
- Yes.

02:03:23.954 --> 02:03:24.788
Bobby.

02:03:25.831 --> 02:03:27.082
You know Dobrynin best.

02:03:27.916 --> 02:03:28.750
Yeah.

02:03:30.627 --> 02:03:32.087
Then you're it.

02:03:33.860 --> 02:03:36.049
Ted, I want you to
start working on the draft.

02:03:36.154 --> 02:03:38.448
And, Bobby, you gotta go in there.
You gotta make them understand

02:03:39.386 --> 02:03:41.054
that we have to have
an answer tomorrow,

02:03:41.367 --> 02:03:43.661
because Monday we go to war.

02:04:01.387 --> 02:04:03.576
What do you want?
A good-bye kiss?

02:04:06.913 --> 02:04:09.833
Hey, Joe, listen.
I'll take care of him.

02:04:09.833 --> 02:04:12.126
Go on inside. Grab some coffee.
We'll be back pretty quick.

02:04:12.335 --> 02:04:13.691
- Are you sure?
- Sure.

02:04:13.795 --> 02:04:15.463
What's the matter with you?

02:04:15.567 --> 02:04:17.236
Forget how to open
a car door?

02:04:20.259 --> 02:04:21.719
Jesus.

02:04:22.449 --> 02:04:23.909
You rich people.

02:04:33.189 --> 02:04:36.213
I promised the girls
I'd take them riding tomorrow.

02:04:38.715 --> 02:04:40.279
Make sure
you keep that date.

02:04:43.824 --> 02:04:46.327
We gave up so much to get here.

02:04:48.412 --> 02:04:50.915
I don't know. Sometimes I think,
what the hell did we do it for?

02:04:51.957 --> 02:04:53.938
Well, I don't know
about you, but

02:04:54.147 --> 02:04:55.920
I'm in it for the money.

02:05:02.384 --> 02:05:05.304
We knew we could do
a better job than everyone else.

02:05:05.929 --> 02:05:06.972
Remember?

02:05:08.432 --> 02:05:09.996
You know, I...

02:05:11.768 --> 02:05:15.209
l—I hate being called
the brilliant one,

02:05:15.731 --> 02:05:17.712
the ruthless one...

02:05:18.233 --> 02:05:20.527
The guy everybody's afraid of.

02:05:20.944 --> 02:05:22.404
I hate it.

02:05:23.759 --> 02:05:26.158
I'm not so smart, you know?

02:05:27.409 --> 02:05:28.973
I'm not so ruthless.

02:05:29.181 --> 02:05:31.475
Well, you're right
about the smart part.

02:05:41.798 --> 02:05:43.466
I don't know if I can do this.

02:05:45.135 --> 02:05:47.220
There's nobody else
I'd rather have going in there

02:05:47.637 --> 02:05:48.993
than you—

02:05:49.305 --> 02:05:51.808
Nobody else
I'd trust Helen and...

02:05:51.912 --> 02:05:53.163
the kids' lives to.

02:05:56.396 --> 02:05:57.647
Take a left.

02:06:17.771 --> 02:06:19.126
You smell that?

02:06:19.543 --> 02:06:21.629
They're burning
their documents.

02:06:22.776 --> 02:06:25.174
They think we're going to war.

02:06:27.259 --> 02:06:29.136
God help us, Ken.

02:07:12.304 --> 02:07:15.745
Sir, Ambassador Dobrynin
is already here.
He's waiting in your office.

02:07:16.996 --> 02:07:18.143
Here.

02:07:26.901 --> 02:07:29.091
I'll whistle up
some luck for you.

02:07:37.641 --> 02:07:40.144
Mr. Ambassador. Thank you.

02:08:33.008 --> 02:08:34.468
Who are you?

02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:46.876
A friend.

02:09:08.772 --> 02:09:11.900
My brother, my friends,
my countrymen, and I

02:09:12.005 --> 02:09:13.569
cannot and will not permit

02:09:13.673 --> 02:09:15.237
those missiles
to become operational.

02:09:15.550 --> 02:09:16.593
I promise you that.

02:09:16.697 --> 02:09:19.721
Then I fear our 2 nations
will go to war...

02:09:20.346 --> 02:09:22.953
And I fear
where war will lead us.

02:09:23.057 --> 02:09:25.872
If the missiles do not
become operational,

02:09:26.185 --> 02:09:27.645
if you remove the missiles,

02:09:27.749 --> 02:09:29.730
then there will be no war.

02:09:31.086 --> 02:09:33.276
At this moment, the President
is accepting the terms

02:09:33.380 --> 02:09:36.091
of Secretary Khrushchev's
letter of Friday night.

02:09:36.612 --> 02:09:39.323
If the Soviet Union
halts construction immediately,

02:09:39.323 --> 02:09:42.347
removes the missiles,
and submits to U.N. Inspection,

02:09:42.451 --> 02:09:44.120
the United States will pledge

02:09:44.328 --> 02:09:47.873
to never invade Cuba or
aid others in that enterprise.

02:09:47.978 --> 02:09:51.210
If your Jupiter missiles in Turkey
were removed also,

02:09:51.418 --> 02:09:53.921
such an accommodation
could be reached.

02:09:54.651 --> 02:09:56.423
That's not possible.

02:09:59.447 --> 02:10:02.888
The United States cannot
agree to such terms under threat.

02:10:03.931 --> 02:10:07.163
Any belief to the contrary
was in error.

02:10:08.519 --> 02:10:09.978
You want war?

02:10:20.822 --> 02:10:21.969
However...

02:10:22.074 --> 02:10:25.097
While there can be
no quid pro quo on this issue,

02:10:25.306 --> 02:10:28.330
the United States can offer
a private assurance.

02:10:30.415 --> 02:10:32.918
Now, our Jupiter missiles
in Turkey are obsolete

02:10:32.918 --> 02:10:35.629
and have been scheduled
for withdrawal for some time.

02:10:36.254 --> 02:10:40.008
This withdrawal should take place
within, say, 6 months.

02:10:40.946 --> 02:10:42.719
Of course,
any public disclosure

02:10:42.927 --> 02:10:45.430
of this assurance
would negate the deal

02:10:45.430 --> 02:10:48.558
and produce the most stringent
denials from our Government.

02:10:49.392 --> 02:10:51.269
This private assurance

02:10:51.373 --> 02:10:54.084
represents the word
of the Highest Authority?

02:10:55.231 --> 02:10:56.170
Yes.

02:10:57.108 --> 02:10:59.610
And it can be relayed beyond
Comrade Khrushchev's ears

02:10:59.819 --> 02:11:02.113
to the top circles
of my Government?

02:11:02.530 --> 02:11:04.824
Our pledge can be relayed
to any Government officials

02:11:04.824 --> 02:11:07.952
Secretary Khrushchev
sees fit to satisfy,

02:11:08.682 --> 02:11:11.289
with the caveat that
it is not to be made public

02:11:11.497 --> 02:11:14.104
in any way, shape, or form.

02:11:18.275 --> 02:11:20.569
And we must have
an answer tomorrow,

02:11:20.986 --> 02:11:22.028
at the latest.

02:11:22.133 --> 02:11:24.427
I cannot stress
this point enough.

02:11:25.052 --> 02:11:26.720
Tomorrow?

02:11:28.076 --> 02:11:29.223
Tomorrow.

02:11:31.308 --> 02:11:34.332
Then you must excuse me
and permit me to relay

02:11:34.541 --> 02:11:37.043
the substance of our discussion
to my superiors.

02:11:37.147 --> 02:11:38.503
Of course.

02:11:40.901 --> 02:11:44.759
We have heard stories that
some of your military men
wish for war.

02:11:46.636 --> 02:11:48.408
You're a good man.

02:11:48.617 --> 02:11:50.285
Your brother is a good man.

02:11:50.390 --> 02:11:53.101
I assure you
there are other good men.

02:11:53.726 --> 02:11:54.977
Let us hope
the will of good men

02:11:55.082 --> 02:11:56.959
is enough to counter
the terrible strength

02:11:57.063 --> 02:11:59.982
of this thing
that was put in motion.

02:12:42.211 --> 02:12:43.984
What's going to happen?

02:12:47.216 --> 02:12:49.719
If the sun comes up tomorrow,

02:12:51.074 --> 02:12:53.994
it is only because
of men of good will.

02:12:56.601 --> 02:12:58.060
And that's...

02:12:58.790 --> 02:13:01.814
That's all there is
between us and the Devil.

02:13:36.223 --> 02:13:38.934
<i>This is Radio Moscow.</i>

02:13:39.247 --> 02:13:41.645
<i>Premier Khrushchev
has sent a message</i>

02:13:41.749 --> 02:13:44.147
<i>to President Kennedy today.</i>

02:13:44.460 --> 02:13:46.441
<i>The Soviet Prime Minister
reemphasizes</i>

02:13:46.650 --> 02:13:50.925
<i>the need for urgent measures
to prevent a fatal turn of events</i>

02:13:51.029 --> 02:13:52.697
<i>and to preserve world peace.</i>

02:13:54.366 --> 02:13:57.389
<i>In addition to instructions
earlier transmitted</i>

02:13:57.494 --> 02:14:00.413
<i>to stop construction work
on installations in Cuba,</i>

02:14:00.622 --> 02:14:02.186
<i>the Soviet Government
has ordered</i>

02:14:02.290 --> 02:14:05.001
<i>the dismantling
of weapons in Cuba,</i>

02:14:05.105 --> 02:14:06.252
<i>as well as their crating</i>

02:14:06.357 --> 02:14:08.651
<i>and return to the Soviet Union.</i>

02:14:20.224 --> 02:14:22.310
Is everybody ready for church?

02:14:30.443 --> 02:14:32.424
It's a beautiful morning.

02:14:36.595 --> 02:14:38.472
Pass the butter up to Dad.

02:14:43.894 --> 02:14:45.979
Dad, you want your paper?

02:14:50.358 --> 02:14:52.235
Dad, what's wrong?

02:14:56.927 --> 02:14:58.804
The sun came up.

02:15:00.577 --> 02:15:03.809
Every day the sun comes up
says something about us.

02:15:13.923 --> 02:15:15.904
What does it say, Dad?

02:15:17.468 --> 02:15:19.658
What's wrong with Daddy?

02:15:54.692 --> 02:15:57.090
This is the foreign policy trophy
we were hoping for.

02:15:57.195 --> 02:15:58.655
Mr. President, sir.

02:16:02.825 --> 02:16:04.911
Mr. President, great job.

02:16:05.223 --> 02:16:07.205
Hold it, hold it.

02:16:07.726 --> 02:16:09.499
Well, Mr. President,

02:16:09.707 --> 02:16:12.210
I think I can speak
for everyone here

02:16:12.418 --> 02:16:14.921
when I say,
"Bring on those mid-terms,

02:16:15.025 --> 02:16:17.006
there's no stopping us now."

02:16:18.153 --> 02:16:20.343
- 4 more years.
- All right.

02:16:20.760 --> 02:16:23.992
You know, it's been
a long 2 weeks, and...

02:16:24.096 --> 02:16:25.347
or whatever, but...

02:16:25.452 --> 02:16:27.746
I'd like to thank you all.
I think you all did a great job,

02:16:27.850 --> 02:16:29.310
and I just think...

02:16:30.144 --> 02:16:33.480
I don't think we should be
gloating too much.

02:16:34.627 --> 02:16:36.191
It was...

02:16:36.400 --> 02:16:38.798
just as much a victory
for them as it was for us.

02:16:38.902 --> 02:16:40.361
Hear, hear.

02:16:40.466 --> 02:16:41.612
Enjoy your morning.

02:16:41.822 --> 02:16:43.699
Thank you, Mr. President.

02:16:46.200 --> 02:16:47.557
Get some rest, Mr. President.

02:16:49.120 --> 02:16:51.102
We've got a lot
of new clout right now,

02:16:51.206 --> 02:16:53.083
and we can run the table
on Khrushchev,

02:16:53.187 --> 02:16:54.334
the Middle East,
and Southeast Asia.

02:16:54.439 --> 02:16:56.210
Right. You're right.

02:17:07.888 --> 02:17:09.870
Dear Mr. And Mrs. Anderson,

02:17:11.226 --> 02:17:14.250
I was deeply shocked
when advised your son was lost

02:17:14.980 --> 02:17:16.752
in an operational mission
on Saturday,

02:17:17.585 --> 02:17:20.297
<i>October 27, 1962.</i>

02:17:22.174 --> 02:17:23.530
<i>Your son rendered distinguished</i>

02:17:23.634 --> 02:17:25.824
<i>and dedicated service
to his country</i>

02:17:25.824 --> 02:17:27.596
<i>throughout his career.</i>

02:17:28.638 --> 02:17:30.620
<i>He was admired...</i>

02:17:31.350 --> 02:17:32.705
<i>and respected</i>

02:17:32.914 --> 02:17:34.165
<i>for his courage,</i>

02:17:34.790 --> 02:17:37.709
<i>and his professional skill
by all with whom he served.</i>

02:17:38.335 --> 02:17:40.838
<i>His tragic loss
will be deeply felt...</i>

02:17:42.193 --> 02:17:45.009
<i>and a grateful nation
will be forever in his debt.</i>

02:18:06.593 --> 02:18:07.531
Ken, we're out here.

02:18:27.968 --> 02:18:30.366
<i>What kind of a peace
do we seek?</i>

02:18:30.782 --> 02:18:33.076
<i>I am talking about
genuine peace—</i>

02:18:33.181 --> 02:18:36.621
<i>The kind of peace that makes
life on earth worth living—</i>

02:18:36.727 --> 02:18:39.021
<i>Not merely peace in our time,</i>

02:18:39.021 --> 02:18:41.002
<i>but peace in all time.</i>

02:18:41.522 --> 02:18:43.816
<i>Our problems are man-made,</i>

02:18:43.816 --> 02:18:46.528
<i>therefore,
they can be solved by man.</i>

02:18:46.632 --> 02:18:48.612
<i>For in the final analysis,</i>

02:18:48.612 --> 02:18:51.116
<i>our most basic common link</i>

02:18:51.324 --> 02:18:53.200
<i>is that we all inhabit</i>

02:18:53.200 --> 02:18:55.287
<i>this small planet.</i>

02:18:55.495 --> 02:18:57.789
<i>We all breathe the same air.</i>

02:18:57.893 --> 02:19:00.500
<i>We all cherish
our children's future,</i>

02:19:00.500 --> 02:19:02.690
<i>and we are all mortal.</i>
