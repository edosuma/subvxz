WEBVTT

01:40.391 --> 01:41.517
ALL RIGHT, CHILDREN.

01:41.684 --> 01:43.560
TODAY WE'RE GOING
TO BEGIN OUR STUDY
OF ENTOMOLOGY.

01:43.728 --> 01:44.394
CAN ANYONE TELL ME
WHAT THAT IS?

01:44.562 --> 01:46.563
YES, MARY?

01:46.731 --> 01:47.773
IS THAT THE STUDY
OF THE EARTH

01:47.941 --> 01:49.233
AND HOW MOUNTAINS
AND RIVERS AND
CAVES WERE MADE?

01:49.400 --> 01:52.402
NO, THAT'S
GEOLOGY, BUT THAT
WAS A GOOD TRY.

01:52.570 --> 01:53.987
GRASSHOPPERS.

01:54.155 --> 01:55.155
THAT'S RIGHT.

01:55.323 --> 01:57.407
ENTOMOLOGY IS THE
STUDY OF INSECTS,

01:57.575 --> 01:58.575
AND NOW THAT
SPRING IS HERE

01:58.743 --> 02:00.077
AND THE INSECTS ARE
STARTING TO HATCH,

02:00.245 --> 02:02.412
WE'RE GOING TO BE
ABLE TO SEE OUR LITTLE
FRIENDS ALL AROUND US.

02:02.580 --> 02:04.623
FRIENDS? THEY
EAT THE CROPS.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.166
YES, BUT MOST INSECTS
ARE MAN'S FRIEND.

02:06.334 --> 02:09.044
YOU NEVER GOT
CAUGHT IN A SWARM
OF BEES BEFORE.

02:09.212 --> 02:10.254
OH, DID YOU,
CARL?

02:10.421 --> 02:12.005
YOU BET.
I GOT STUNG PLENTY

02:12.173 --> 02:13.590
BEFORE I COULD EVEN
GET TO THE POND.

02:13.758 --> 02:16.135
WELL, I'M SURE THEY
WERE ONLY TRYING TO
PROTECT THEIR QUEEN.

02:16.302 --> 02:18.428
I GOT STUNG ONCE
ON THE OUTHOUSE.

02:18.596 --> 02:20.097
[LAUGHTER]

02:20.265 --> 02:22.599
ALL RIGHT.
CAN ANYONE TELL ME
HOW A BEE HELPS MAN?

02:22.767 --> 02:24.268
Laura:
THEY MAKE HONEY.

02:24.435 --> 02:25.477
THAT'S RIGHT,

02:25.645 --> 02:27.229
AND THEY ALSO
POLLINATE
THE FLOWERS.

02:27.397 --> 02:28.438
Nellie:
WHAT DOES
THAT MEAN?

02:28.606 --> 02:30.941
WELL, WHEN THE BEE
GOES ABOUT COLLECTING
THE NECTAR

02:31.109 --> 02:32.276
FROM THE FLOWER
TO MAKE HIS HONEY,

02:32.443 --> 02:35.154
HE CARRIES THE POLLEN
ON HIS LEGS FROM
FLOWER TO FLOWER,

02:35.321 --> 02:37.114
AND THAT WAY,
IT MAKES
MORE FLOWERS.

02:37.282 --> 02:38.365
SO, YOU SEE,
HE REALLY IS
MAN'S FRIEND.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.450
ALL RIGHT.

02:40.618 --> 02:42.452
LET'S LOOK AT
THIS DIAGRAM OF
THE GRASSHOPPER,

02:42.620 --> 02:44.663
AND WE CAN LEARN THE DIFFERENT
PARTS OF THE INSECT'S BODY.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.207
THIS IS THE HEAD,
OF COURSE.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.251
I'M SURE THAT'S EASY
TO REMEMBER.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.086
THIS PART IS CALLED
THE THORAX.

02:51.254 --> 02:51.628
LET ME HEAR
YOU SAY THAT.

02:51.796 --> 02:54.089
Children: THORAX.

02:54.257 --> 02:56.216
RIGHT.
AND THIS PART IS--

02:56.384 --> 02:59.136
IT'S THE BEHIND.
THAT'S WHERE THE
BEE STUNG ME.

02:59.304 --> 03:00.387
[LAUGHTER]

03:00.555 --> 03:02.222
WILLIE, GO STAND
IN THE CORNER.

03:06.644 --> 03:09.396
NOW, THE REASON I'M HAVING
YOU LEARN THE DIFFERENT
PARTS OF THE INSECT'S BODY

03:09.564 --> 03:11.398
IS THAT I WANT YOU TO
START COLLECTING THEM,

03:11.566 --> 03:12.691
ALL DIFFERENT KINDS,

03:12.859 --> 03:14.359
SO WE CAN COMPARE THEM AND
SEE HOW THEY'RE DIFFERENT.

03:14.527 --> 03:16.361
MISS BEADLE, CAN WE
COLLECT BUTTERFLIES?

03:16.529 --> 03:18.155
ABSOLUTELY.

03:18.323 --> 03:22.409
MISS BEADLE,
WHAT GOOD ARE
BUTTERFLIES TO MAN?

03:22.577 --> 03:24.661
THEY MAKE THE
WORLD PRETTIER.

03:26.331 --> 03:28.665
[SAW BUZZING]

03:37.675 --> 03:39.301
MORNING,
INGALLS.

03:39.469 --> 03:40.677
MR. LOUDY.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.308
IS MR. HANSON
AROUND?

03:46.476 --> 03:48.560
YEAH.

03:48.728 --> 03:51.271
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE,
LOUDY?

03:51.439 --> 03:53.190
OH,
MR. HANSON.

03:53.358 --> 03:56.151
I CAME TO SEE
YOU ABOUT A JOB.

03:56.319 --> 03:57.611
LOOK, WE'VE
BEEN OVER
THIS BEFORE,

03:57.779 --> 03:58.695
AND THE
ANSWER
IS NO.

03:58.863 --> 04:00.197
PLEASE,
MR. HANSON.

04:00.365 --> 04:02.157
THINGS ARE DIFFERENT.
I'VE CHANGED.

04:02.325 --> 04:04.243
I HAVEN'T HAD A DROP
IN WEEKS.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.328
I TOLD YOU
BEFORE, LOUDY.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.622
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH
THE LIKES OF YOU.

04:08.790 --> 04:09.831
NOW, GET.

04:09.999 --> 04:11.750
PLEASE, MR. HANSON.
I'VE LOOKED
EVERYWHERE.

04:11.918 --> 04:12.834
I'VE JUST GOT
TO HAVE A JOB.

04:13.002 --> 04:15.337
- NOT HERE.
- IT'S BEEN OVER 20 YEARS!

04:15.505 --> 04:16.546
I DON'T CARE IF
IT'S 100 YEARS.

04:16.714 --> 04:19.633
IT'S BECAUSE
SHE MARRIED ME,
ISN'T IT?

04:19.801 --> 04:21.218
BECAUSE
SHE MARRIED ME?

04:21.386 --> 04:24.179
THE TRUTH.
THE TRUTH, HANSON!

04:24.347 --> 04:26.431
BECAUSE YOU
KILLED HER!

04:28.434 --> 04:32.813
AND NOTHING WILL EVER
CHANGE THAT...OR YOU.

04:34.482 --> 04:35.274
Mr. Loudy:
YOU'RE RIGHT, HANSON.

04:35.441 --> 04:39.444
LOOK! NOTHING
HAS CHANGED!
NOTHING!

05:19.610 --> 05:20.610
YOU ALL
RIGHT?

05:20.778 --> 05:22.487
YEAH.

05:25.575 --> 05:26.491
WHEN I SEE HIM,
I REMEMBER,

05:26.659 --> 05:28.869
AND I...

05:30.913 --> 05:35.417
IT'S NOT BECAUSE
SHE MARRIED HIM.

05:35.585 --> 05:37.419
HE WAS WITH
THE RAILROAD--

05:37.587 --> 05:39.796
A CONSTRUCTION
ENGINEER--

05:39.964 --> 05:43.425
AND, UH, GOOD
MONEY, GOOD JOB,

05:43.593 --> 05:46.511
AND I WAS
JUST BEGINNING.

05:47.972 --> 05:51.516
SHE WAS
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.897
DON'T YOU THINK
HE'S SUFFERED
ENOUGH?

05:58.608 --> 05:59.149
THE FIRE WAS
AN ACCIDENT.

05:59.317 --> 06:01.401
IT WASN'T
HIS FAULT.

06:03.946 --> 06:08.533
HE SAVED HIMSELF AND
HIS LITTLE GIRL...

06:09.952 --> 06:12.913
BUT HE LEFT HER IN
THAT HOUSE TO DIE.

06:14.957 --> 06:18.919
HE SAVED HIMSELF,
BUT NOT MY ELLEN.

06:23.007 --> 06:24.925
YOU HAVE WORK
TO DO, CHARLES.

06:39.565 --> 06:40.440
HI, MA.

06:40.608 --> 06:41.775
Mary: HI, MA.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.693
HELLO, GIRLS.
YOU'RE HOME FROM
SCHOOL AWFULLY EARLY.

06:43.861 --> 06:44.861
WE WALKED
FAST.

06:45.029 --> 06:46.822
BECAUSE WE GOT TO
GET STARTED ON
OUR HOMEWORK.

06:46.989 --> 06:47.864
LAURA, WHAT ARE
YOU LOOKING FOR?

06:48.032 --> 06:49.449
WE NEED
TWO JARS.

06:49.617 --> 06:50.659
WHAT FOR?

06:50.827 --> 06:51.910
FOR OUR
HOMEWORK, MA.

06:52.078 --> 06:52.953
WE'RE STUDYING
ENTO...ENTOMO...

06:53.121 --> 06:54.454
WE'RE
STUDYING
BUGS, MA.

06:54.622 --> 06:56.665
YEAH.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.542
HERE'S
TWO.

06:58.709 --> 07:00.377
CAN WE
USE THESE
TWO JARS?

07:00.545 --> 07:02.796
OH, LAURA,
I'M RUNNING AWFULLY
LOW ON CANNING JARS.

07:02.964 --> 07:03.964
WE'LL BRING
THEM BACK.

07:04.132 --> 07:05.257
ALL RIGHT.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.842
Caroline: I SUPPOSE I CAN
BOIL THEM OUT AFTERWARD.

07:07.009 --> 07:08.051
THANKS, MA.

07:08.219 --> 07:10.720
Mary: WE NEED SOMETHING TO
CATCH BUTTERFLIES WITH, TOO.

07:10.888 --> 07:12.889
UH, LET'S SEE.

07:13.057 --> 07:15.016
YOU'LL FIND
SOME CHEESECLOTH
IN THE DRAWER,

07:15.184 --> 07:16.893
AND I'M SURE
THERE'S SOME
WIRE IN THE BARN.

07:17.061 --> 07:19.229
I'LL GET THE WIRE.

07:20.731 --> 07:21.898
I WANT TO GO WITH THEM.

07:22.066 --> 07:24.568
Caroline:
DON'T YOU WANT TO GO
INTO TOWN WITH ME?

07:24.735 --> 07:25.235
I WANT TO CATCH BUGS.

07:25.403 --> 07:26.862
Caroline:
HA HA HA!

07:27.029 --> 07:28.488
ALL RIGHT.

07:28.656 --> 07:30.449
OH, MA,
DOES SHE
HAVE TO GO?

07:30.616 --> 07:32.284
YOU HAVE TO
BE REAL QUIET
TO CATCH BUGS.

07:32.452 --> 07:35.036
I'LL BE QUIET.
I PROMISE.

07:36.247 --> 07:38.248
BUT WE'RE GOING
ALL THE WAY TO
WILLOW LAKE.

07:38.416 --> 07:41.334
SHE WANTS TO
GO SO BADLY.

07:41.502 --> 07:42.586
OH, ALL RIGHT.

07:42.753 --> 07:45.422
IF WE DON'T
GET ANY BUGS,
YOU'LL KNOW WHY.

07:45.590 --> 07:46.756
COME ON,
CARRIE.

07:48.092 --> 07:49.468
KEEP AN EYE ON HER,

07:49.635 --> 07:51.636
AND BE HOME IN TIME
TO HELP WITH SUPPER.

07:51.804 --> 07:52.804
YES, MA'AM.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.181
I'M GOING
TO CATCH BUGS.

08:02.773 --> 08:04.983
[HUMMING]

08:05.151 --> 08:06.401
GOOD DAY,
MISS BEADLE.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.695
- OH, MRS. INGALLS,
HOW ARE YOU?
- FINE.

08:08.863 --> 08:10.614
MY CHILDREN JUST
RACED OFF ON THEIR
HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT.

08:10.781 --> 08:12.574
OH, I HAVE THE
FEELING THAT,
BY TOMORROW,

08:12.742 --> 08:13.950
MY CLASSROOM
IS GOING TO BE
LITERALLY BUZZING.

08:14.118 --> 08:16.203
I'LL MAKE SURE
THEY DON'T BRING
ANYTHING THAT BITES.

08:16.370 --> 08:17.621
OH, WELL, I GUESS
I'D APPRECIATE THAT.

08:17.788 --> 08:19.581
[LAUGHS]
HAVE A NICE DAY.
BYE-BYE!

08:20.791 --> 08:21.917
- MISS BEADLE!
Miss Beadle: YES, WILLIE?

08:22.084 --> 08:25.212
LOOK AT MY
COLLECTION.

08:25.379 --> 08:26.588
UH, WELL, IT'S
VERY NICE, WILLIE,

08:26.756 --> 08:29.132
BUT I THINK YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO GET
YOUR OWN COLLECTION.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.843
I DID.
I GOT IT FROM
BEHIND THE COUNTER.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.262
NO, WILLIE.
WHAT I MEAN IS,

08:34.430 --> 08:35.472
ALL THE
OTHER CHILDREN

08:35.640 --> 08:37.307
ARE GOING TO GO
A LONG WAY TO FIND
THEIR INSECTS.

08:37.475 --> 08:39.809
A LONG WAYS? HA!
LOOK ON THE BACK.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.019
"MADE IN ENGLAND."

08:41.187 --> 08:44.064
NONE OF THE OTHER
KIDS ARE GOING
THAT LONG A WAYS.

08:45.775 --> 08:46.816
I'LL SEE
YOU IN SCHOOL
TOMORROW, WILLIE.

08:46.984 --> 08:49.069
SEE YOU.

08:53.741 --> 08:55.325
Laura: GET HIM, MARY!
- I'M TRYING!

08:55.493 --> 08:56.576
Laura: JUST--
- OH!

08:56.744 --> 08:57.160
Laura: JUST
SWOOP IT DOWN.

08:57.328 --> 08:58.828
WHERE'D HE GO?

08:58.996 --> 08:59.788
GET HIM!
GET IT.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.249
Laura: GET HIM!

09:02.416 --> 09:04.793
I'M TRYING.

09:04.961 --> 09:07.212
Mary: OH!

09:08.005 --> 09:10.131
GRAB HIM!

09:11.968 --> 09:13.426
Mary:
GOT IT.

09:13.594 --> 09:13.885
DON'T
SQUEEZE IT.

09:14.053 --> 09:16.638
I WON'T.

09:16.806 --> 09:17.764
WHERE IS HE?

09:17.932 --> 09:18.932
CAREFUL, DON'T
HURT ITS WINGS.

09:19.100 --> 09:22.936
SEE HIS BIG EYES?
AND THERE'S
HIS FEELERS.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.354
HOW MANY
WE GOT NOW?

09:24.522 --> 09:26.940
LET'S SEE--
WE GOT ANTS,
A CATERPILLAR,

09:27.108 --> 09:28.817
A GRASSHOPPER,
AND SOME LADYBUGS.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.360
I HOPE THEY
DON'T EAT
EACH OTHER.

09:30.528 --> 09:31.695
THEY WON'T.

09:31.862 --> 09:32.654
THEY'RE TOO WORRIED
ABOUT BEING CAUGHT
TO BE HUNGRY.

09:35.324 --> 09:37.033
Laura: WE GOT A WHOLE
BUNCH OF THEM, CARRIE.

09:38.869 --> 09:40.495
Laura: CAN I PUT THEM
IN THE JAR FOR YOU?

09:40.663 --> 09:41.830
Mary: NO,
I CAN DO IT.

09:43.874 --> 09:45.500
THE TOP'S
GONE!

09:45.668 --> 09:47.877
ALL THE BUGS
ARE GONE!

09:48.045 --> 09:49.379
CARRIE!

09:49.547 --> 09:51.840
CARRIE,
WHY DID YOU
DO THAT?

09:52.008 --> 09:54.884
I DON'T KNOW.

09:55.052 --> 09:56.052
NOW, YOU
LISTEN TO ME.

09:56.220 --> 09:56.886
YOU SIT HERE
WITH JACK AND
DON'T MOVE.

09:57.054 --> 09:58.888
UNDERSTAND?

09:59.056 --> 10:00.724
YES.

10:00.891 --> 10:01.891
COME ON,
LAURA.

10:02.059 --> 10:03.268
LET'S START
ALL OVER.

YOU STAY
THERE, JACK.

YOU ABOUT READY?

11:56.382 --> 11:57.757
YEAH, JUST GOT
TO SHUT HER DOWN.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.050
CLIMB ABOARD.

12:12.148 --> 12:13.815
HELLO,
MR. HANSON.

12:14.525 --> 12:17.193
HOW ARE YOU,
MR. HANSON?

12:17.361 --> 12:19.362
Charles: UNH!
I'M HUNGRY AS A BEAR.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.281
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH MR. HANSON?

12:21.449 --> 12:23.658
HE DIDN'T EVEN
SPEAK TO ME.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.201
OH, WENDELL LOUDY
CAME BY TODAY.

12:25.369 --> 12:26.619
OH...

12:26.787 --> 12:27.871
I FELT SORRY
FOR HIM.

12:28.038 --> 12:31.082
IT'S NEVER GOING
TO CHANGE BETWEEN
THOSE TWO.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.917
HYAH!
COME ON, JUDY.

12:41.552 --> 12:45.305
HEY, LOOK AT
THESE BIG ANTS.

SUPPOSED TO STAY
WITH CARRIE!

12:53.022 --> 12:55.273

12:55.441 --> 12:56.983
BE QUIET, JACK.
YOU'LL SCARE ALL
THE BUGS AWAY.

BE QUIET!

13:05.785 --> 13:08.077

AWFUL FUNNY.

13:08.245 --> 13:09.120
HE ALWAYS
ACTS FUNNY.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.623
NO,
I MEAN IT.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.708
I THINK WE'D BETTER
CHECK ON CARRIE.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.335
WE'VE COME AN
AWFUL LONG WAY.

13:15.503 --> 13:19.756
YEAH, I GUESS
YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:19.924 --> 13:21.716
ALL RIGHT,
COME ON.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.802
Jack: [BARKING]

13:34.355 --> 13:37.106
CHARLES,
LOOK.

13:45.199 --> 13:46.950
STAY HERE.

13:54.291 --> 13:59.754
MR. LOUDY?

13:59.922 --> 14:01.005
WHAT?

14:03.342 --> 14:04.133
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

14:04.301 --> 14:06.970
YOU ALL RIGHT?

14:07.137 --> 14:08.346
[SIGHS]

14:08.514 --> 14:11.975
LEAVE ME ALONE.
YOU WERE THERE.

14:12.142 --> 14:15.937
YOU SAW ME...
BEGGING FOR A JOB.

14:16.105 --> 14:19.274
YEAH, WELL, I'M NOT
THE ONE THAT HIRES.
HANSON IS.

14:19.441 --> 14:20.608
HEY, COME ON.
LET ME HELP YOU.

14:20.776 --> 14:22.819
I DON'T NEED
YOUR HELP!

14:29.535 --> 14:31.953
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING
ABOUT YOUR FRIEND,

14:32.121 --> 14:35.331
THE ALMIGHTY LARS HANSON.

14:37.251 --> 14:40.003
AFTER IT HAPPENED AND
I STARTED DRINKING,

14:40.170 --> 14:43.214
IT WAS HANSON WHO TOLD
THE GOD-FEARING PEOPLE
IN THIS TOWN

14:43.382 --> 14:46.885
TO TELL THE JUDGE
TO TAKE AWAY
MY LITTLE GIRL.

14:49.346 --> 14:52.140
THEY LEFT ME
WITH NOTHING,

14:52.308 --> 14:54.684
AND I AIN'T EVER
GOING TO FORGET.

15:02.026 --> 15:03.109
WHY DON'T YOU
COME HOME WITH ME

15:03.277 --> 15:05.361
AND TAKE SUPPER
WITH MY FAMILY?

15:05.529 --> 15:08.156
SUPPER? WHAT DO
YOU WANT FROM ME?

15:08.324 --> 15:09.407
DON'T WANT
ANYTHING, I JUST--

15:09.575 --> 15:12.201
GO ON HOME WITH
YOUR FAMILY AND
CHOKE ON YOUR FOOD.

15:12.369 --> 15:14.913
I DON'T WANT IT.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.041
SUIT YOURSELF.

15:19.293 --> 15:20.627
INGALLS?

15:25.049 --> 15:25.381
YOU HAVE CHILDREN?

15:25.549 --> 15:28.259
YEAH, 3 GIRLS.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.013
3 GIRLS.

15:32.681 --> 15:36.142
MY LITTLE GIRL'S...

15:36.310 --> 15:39.020
A GROWN WOMAN NOW.

15:39.188 --> 15:43.107
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER
IN ALL THESE YEARS.

15:43.275 --> 15:43.900
BUT SHE WROTE
ME A LETTER.

15:44.068 --> 15:45.735
SHE'S COMING
TO SEE ME.

15:45.903 --> 15:46.903
AFTER ALL
THESE YEARS,

15:47.071 --> 15:49.572
SHE'S COMING
ALL THIS WAY
JUST TO SEE ME.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.870
I'D RATHER BE DEAD
THAN HAVE HER SEE
ME LIKE THIS.

15:56.038 --> 15:58.915
THEN DON'T LET HER
SEE YOU THIS WAY.

16:00.417 --> 16:01.125
WHAT CAN I DO?

16:01.293 --> 16:03.753
I NEED A JOB,
SOME CLEAN CLOTHES,

16:03.921 --> 16:05.088
AND A DECENT
PLACE TO LIVE.

16:05.255 --> 16:07.090
IT'S NO GOOD FOR
A MAN TO LOOK GOOD
ON THE OUTSIDE

16:07.257 --> 16:08.925
WHEN HE'S ROTTING
AWAY ON THE INSIDE.

16:11.220 --> 16:14.597
HEY, COME ON,
TAKE SOME
SUPPER WITH US.

16:17.977 --> 16:18.267
CAROLINE,
YOU KNOW
MR. LOUDY.

16:18.435 --> 16:20.311
CERTAINLY.

16:20.479 --> 16:23.022
Charles: HE'S
GOING TO HAVE
SUPPER WITH US.

16:23.190 --> 16:23.773
IT WON'T BE FANCY,
MR. LOUDY,

16:23.941 --> 16:26.526
BUT WE'VE
GOT PLENTY.

16:26.694 --> 16:28.611
THANK YOU.

16:40.124 --> 16:41.124
CARRIE?

16:41.291 --> 16:43.209
CARRIE,
WHERE
ARE YOU?

16:43.377 --> 16:45.044
Jack: [BARKING]

16:45.212 --> 16:45.628
SOMETHING
IS WRONG.

16:45.796 --> 16:48.214
SHOW US,
JACK.

16:53.137 --> 16:54.846
Laura: CARRIE!

16:55.014 --> 16:56.222
CARRIE!

16:58.142 --> 17:02.395
CARRIE?

17:02.563 --> 17:03.938
[CARRIE CRYING]

17:04.106 --> 17:04.480
I HEAR HER.

17:04.648 --> 17:06.858
CAN YOU SEE HER?

17:07.026 --> 17:08.234
NO, BUT SHE'S CLOSE.

17:08.402 --> 17:10.778
LAURA, GET PA!
HURRY!

17:10.946 --> 17:13.114
CARRIE, IT'S ALL RIGHT!

17:13.282 --> 17:14.657

17:38.432 --> 17:42.226

17:42.394 --> 17:45.772

17:45.939 --> 17:47.648
CHARLES,
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

17:47.816 --> 17:50.485
MARY AND CARRIE
AREN'T WITH HER.

17:50.652 --> 17:52.320
LAURA,
WHAT'S WRONG?

17:52.488 --> 17:53.154
IT'S CARRIE.

17:53.322 --> 17:56.115
WHAT ABOUT HER?
WHERE IS SHE?

17:56.283 --> 17:57.366
WHERE ARE
YOUR SISTERS?

17:57.534 --> 17:59.077
[PANTING]

17:59.244 --> 18:00.286
CARRIE FELL.

18:00.454 --> 18:02.163
SHE FELL DOWN A HOLE...

18:02.331 --> 18:02.914
IN THE FIELD
BY WILLOW LAKE.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.208
GET IN THE WAGON.
SHOW US.

18:09.880 --> 18:16.260
Charles: HYAH!
HYAH! HYAH!

18:41.787 --> 18:43.913
Charles:
WHOA!

18:45.791 --> 18:47.083
MARY, HOW IS SHE?

18:47.251 --> 18:47.500
I DON'T
KNOW, PA.

18:47.668 --> 18:50.169
CARRIE!

18:50.337 --> 18:51.254
Caroline and Charles:
CARRIE!

18:51.421 --> 18:53.422
CARRIE!

18:53.590 --> 18:54.340
CARRIE?

18:54.508 --> 18:57.218
Carrie: MAMA.

18:58.053 --> 18:59.554
HOW DEEP DO YOU
FIGURE SHE IS?

18:59.721 --> 19:01.055
I CAN'T TELL.

19:01.223 --> 19:03.224
TAKE A HOLD OF ME.
I'LL SEE IF
I CAN REACH HER.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.730
TRY NOT TO LOOSEN
TOO MUCH OF THE DIRT.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.192
Charles:
I'M STUCK! I'M WEDGED IN!

19:13.360 --> 19:14.527
FORCE YOUR WAY DOWN.

19:14.695 --> 19:16.279
Charles: I'M TRYING!

19:19.408 --> 19:21.075
Charles: HEY, I CAN
ALMOST REACH HER!

19:23.287 --> 19:24.453
Charles:
I CAN SEE HER!

19:28.125 --> 19:29.292
Charles:
JUST A LITTLE MORE.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.128
Charles: CARRIE!

19:32.296 --> 19:33.963
CHARLES,
WHAT HAPPENED?

19:34.131 --> 19:34.463
Charles: PULL ME UP!

19:34.631 --> 19:37.592
Charles: PULL!

19:43.182 --> 19:44.765
I COULD ALMOST REACH
HER, AND SHE SLIPPED AWAY
FURTHER DOWN THE HOLE.

19:44.933 --> 19:47.393
WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO?

19:47.561 --> 19:49.145
I GOT A SHOVEL
IN THE WAGON.

19:49.313 --> 19:50.479
INGALLS, WAIT!

19:51.398 --> 19:52.398
INGALLS,
LISTEN TO ME.

19:52.566 --> 19:54.108
I GOT TO GET
MY LITTLE GIRL
OUT OF THERE!

19:54.276 --> 19:55.651
BUT NOT
THIS WAY.

19:55.819 --> 19:57.111
FOR EVERY SHOVELFUL
OF DIRT YOU TAKE OUT,

19:57.279 --> 19:58.946
ANOTHER WILL
FALL ON CARRIE.

19:59.114 --> 20:01.157
IT WON'T TAKE LONG
TO BURY HER.

20:01.325 --> 20:02.700
WE'LL HAVE TO DIG
A SECOND SHAFT.

20:02.868 --> 20:03.367
A SECOND SHAFT?

20:03.535 --> 20:05.494
A RESCUE ONE.

20:05.662 --> 20:08.206
I USED TO BE
AN ENGINEER.
I KNOW.

20:08.373 --> 20:10.124
WE'LL DIG ALONGSIDE
THE WELL TO A LEVEL
BELOW CARRIE,

20:10.292 --> 20:11.292
THEN MOVE UP
THROUGH THE WELL

20:11.460 --> 20:13.044
AND BRING
HER UP THROUGH
THE SECOND SHAFT.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.378
WE'LL NEED MORE
MEN AND EQUIPMENT,
THOUGH.

20:14.546 --> 20:17.340
YOU RIDE INTO TOWN.
I'LL STAY HERE AND
START DIGGING.

20:17.507 --> 20:19.008
WE'LL NEED PICKS
AND SHOVELS AND ROPE

20:19.176 --> 20:20.218
AND THE BIGGEST
BELLOWS YOU CAN FIND

20:20.385 --> 20:21.510
AND SOME
LENGTHS OF PIPE.

20:21.678 --> 20:22.511
- I'LL GET A BELLOWS
FROM THE BLACKSMITH.
- GOOD.

20:22.679 --> 20:26.015
AND A BOTTLE.

20:26.183 --> 20:26.515
GET ME A BOTTLE.

20:26.683 --> 20:29.310
I NEED IT.

20:29.478 --> 20:30.811
HYAH!

20:37.819 --> 20:39.779
5 POUNDS
OF BROWN BEANS,

20:39.947 --> 20:41.864
A TIN OF BAKING SODA,
AND A SACK OF
WHOLE-WHEAT FLOUR.

20:42.032 --> 20:43.407
ANYTHING ELSE I CAN
GET YOU, EDWARDS?

20:43.575 --> 20:44.533
WELL, BETTER
GET ME A PLUG OF
CHEWING TOBACCO.

20:44.701 --> 20:46.577
ONE THING ABOUT
WORKING AT THE
LUMBER MILL,

20:46.745 --> 20:47.828
YOU CAN'T LIGHT
MANY MATCHES.

20:47.996 --> 20:49.372

BEEN AN ACCIDENT.

20:49.539 --> 20:50.248
I'M GOING TO NEED
SOME EQUIPMENT.

20:50.415 --> 20:51.374
Edwards: WHAT
KIND OF ACCIDENT?

20:51.541 --> 20:53.584
IT'S CARRIE.
SHE FELL DOWN
AN OLD WELL.

20:53.752 --> 20:55.336
IT'S ALL CAVED IN.
THERE'S NO WAY TO
GET HER OUT.

20:55.504 --> 20:56.462
I'M GOING TO NEED
PICKS, SHOVELS,
ROPE, LANTERNS.

20:56.630 --> 20:58.506
ANYTHING YOU NEED.
TAKE IT OUT OF THE STOREROOM.

20:58.674 --> 20:59.715
GO AHEAD.

20:59.883 --> 21:02.218

WILLIE!

21:02.386 --> 21:03.719

ALARM BELL.

21:03.887 --> 21:06.514

21:39.464 --> 21:40.423
DID YOU GET
EVERYTHING

21:40.590 --> 21:42.174
ANY HELP
COMING?

21:42.342 --> 21:44.093
Charles: YEAH, I GOT EVERYTHING.
OLESON AND HANSON ARE ROUNDING
SOME MORE MEN UP.

21:44.261 --> 21:45.720
Mr. Loudy: GOOD.
GRAB A PIECE
OF THAT PIPE.

21:45.887 --> 21:48.806
I'LL GIVE YOU A HAND
WITH THIS. AND THE REST
OF YOU, START DIGGING.

21:56.523 --> 22:00.067
I KEEP TALKING
TO HER, BUT SHE
DOESN'T ANSWER.

22:02.487 --> 22:05.656
Mr. Loudy: DON'T DIG
ANY CLOSER TO THE WELL
THAN ABOUT 6 FEET.

22:05.824 --> 22:06.782
THE SOIL'S AWFUL DRY.

22:06.950 --> 22:07.992
WE DON'T WANT THE WALL
BREAKING IN ON HER.

22:08.160 --> 22:11.620
GET THAT PIPE
DOWN THERE SLOW.

22:12.205 --> 22:14.749
I'LL TIE IT OFF.

22:18.628 --> 22:20.755
SLOW.

22:24.051 --> 22:25.926
TIE IT OFF.

22:31.641 --> 22:32.475
TALK TO HER.

22:36.897 --> 22:39.106
I SAID TALK TO HER!

22:46.698 --> 22:48.491

22:57.542 --> 23:00.002

TO BE ALL RIGHT.

23:02.089 --> 23:04.673
Caroline: CARRIE,
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

23:04.841 --> 23:05.841
TALK AGAIN.

ANSWER YOU.

WE'RE GOING TO
GET HER OUT.

23:53.765 --> 23:56.225
Caroline: WE'RE GOING
TO GET YOU OUT, BABY.

23:56.393 --> 23:57.726
TELL HER
TO BE STILL.

23:57.894 --> 24:00.896
WE DON'T WANT
HER TO SLIP MORE.

24:01.064 --> 24:04.900
CARRIE,
LISTEN TO ME.

24:05.068 --> 24:07.736

BE VERY STILL.

LANTERNS READY.

Loudy: MRS. INGALLS,
YOU AND MARY START
PUMPING THIS REAL SLOW.

24:25.046 --> 24:26.714
SHE'S GOING TO
NEED SOME AIR
DOWN THERE.

24:26.882 --> 24:27.798
LET'S GET
TO DIGGING.

24:27.966 --> 24:28.549
RIGHT.

24:36.975 --> 24:37.558
CHARLES,
HOW'S CARRIE?

24:37.726 --> 24:39.393
WELL, WE CAN
TALK TO HER.

24:39.561 --> 24:41.437
SHE'S SCARED,
BUT I DON'T THINK
SHE'S HURT TOO BAD.

24:41.605 --> 24:42.730
AH, LET ME
TAKE A LOOK.

24:42.898 --> 24:45.774
OH, THIS IS GOOD.
YOU'VE GOT AIR
GOING DOWN TO HER.

24:45.942 --> 24:47.568
HOW DEEP
IS SHE?

24:47.736 --> 24:49.528
30 FEET.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.740
I RAN A LENGTH
OF ROPE DOWN.

24:52.908 --> 24:53.657
LOUDY.

24:53.825 --> 24:54.992
WENDELL'S BEEN
A BIG HELP TO US.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.495
THIS WAS ALL HIS
IDEA--THE AIR PIPE
AND THE RESCUE SHAFT.

24:57.662 --> 24:58.662
YEAH, BUT WHY
THE SHAFT?

24:58.830 --> 24:59.955
MAYBE SHE
COULD TAKE
HOLD OF A ROPE--

25:00.123 --> 25:01.749
Loudy: SHE'S
WEDGED TIGHT.

25:01.917 --> 25:04.627
BESIDES, IF SHE MOVED,
SHE COULD FALL FURTHER.

25:04.794 --> 25:07.046
ALL RIGHT, SO
LET'S SEE WHAT NEEDS
TO BE DONE HERE.

25:07.214 --> 25:10.424
I WANT TO SHORE UP
THE WALLS OF THIS
SHAFT AS WE GO DEEPER.

25:10.592 --> 25:13.302
I DON'T WANT
ANYBODY ELSE TO BE
BURIED ALIVE HERE.

25:16.890 --> 25:21.477
Hanson: ALL RIGHT,
WE'VE GOT LOTS
OF WORK TO DO.

25:21.645 --> 25:23.854
NEED TWO FRESH
MEN IN THE HOLE.

25:26.274 --> 25:30.611
ALL RIGHT, BRING
ME LUMBER, COME ON.

25:30.779 --> 25:33.322
COME ON, WE NEED
TO SHORE UP
THE SIDES HERE.

25:35.242 --> 25:37.660
YEAH,
THAT'S GOOD.

25:37.827 --> 25:39.453
GET IT
WIDER THERE.

25:42.499 --> 25:43.832
YOU READY
FOR THIS?

25:57.514 --> 26:01.100
Dr. Baker: SEND
ANOTHER LIGHT DOWN.

26:01.268 --> 26:03.727
Man: MORE ROPE.
SEND MORE ROPE DOWN.

26:08.942 --> 26:12.111
Dr. Baker: WE NEED A LONGER
ROPE FOR THESE BUCKETS.

26:16.199 --> 26:19.868
ED, JACK, COME HERE.

26:20.036 --> 26:21.745
I WANT YOU FELLAS TO
GO BACK TO MY STORE

26:21.913 --> 26:23.998
AND GET A WHOLE
LOT MORE KEROSENE
OIL, ALL RIGHT?

26:24.165 --> 26:27.084
- OH, MR. OLESON.
- YES, MA'AM?

26:27.252 --> 26:29.712
WE'RE RUNNING
