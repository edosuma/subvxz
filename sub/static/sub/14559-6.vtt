WEBVTT

00:08.942 --> 00:12.046
* It's not your face

00:12.080 --> 00:15.549
* Or the color of your hair

00:15.583 --> 00:19.253
* Or the sound of your voice,
my dear *

00:19.287 --> 00:23.091
* That's got me
dragged in here *

00:23.124 --> 00:29.097
* It's the ice in the seam,
the scheme of you *

00:29.130 --> 00:33.134
* You're supposed
to have the answer *

00:33.167 --> 00:36.304
* You're supposed to have
living proof *

00:42.643 --> 00:46.314
* Yes, I was jealous

00:46.347 --> 00:50.318
*Because you are sworn
* Are sworn *

00:50.351 --> 00:56.590
* How could you come undone
to a word so strong *

00:56.624 --> 01:04.698
* My beating heart,
the anchor to a ship so warm *

01:04.732 --> 01:06.700
* You're supposed
to have the answer *

01:06.734 --> 01:09.237
* You're supposed to have
living proof *

01:12.273 --> 01:13.841
* Well, I am your answer

01:13.874 --> 01:16.444
* I am living

01:24.318 --> 01:26.687
* I watch you eat
and feed this mess *

01:26.720 --> 01:31.225
* To the running wind

01:31.259 --> 01:37.665
* But I know you from before
and after until then *

01:37.698 --> 01:40.134
* Do you have your answer?

01:40.168 --> 01:46.240
* Do you have living proof?

01:46.274 --> 01:47.808
* Well, I am your answer

01:47.841 --> 01:51.111
* I am living.

01:55.383 --> 01:57.185
CHARLIE:
Hey, uh, not too deep now.

01:57.218 --> 01:58.552
ALAN: Charlie, I've been opening
boxes...

01:58.586 --> 02:00.288
Yeah, just be careful.
-You want to do it?

02:00.321 --> 02:01.822
Actually, yes, I do want to do
it. -You can't, it's my knife.

02:01.855 --> 02:03.257
It's my...

02:03.291 --> 02:04.458
Charlie's book,
The Attraction Equation.

02:04.492 --> 02:06.194
Oh, yeah? So, hitting
shelves, huh?

02:06.227 --> 02:08.862
Yeah, tomorrow night,
first book signing.

02:08.896 --> 02:10.764
Ah, nice picture there, bro.

02:10.798 --> 02:11.932
Oh, yeah.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.201
ALAN:
Whoo, look at that.

02:13.234 --> 02:15.369
Where should I sign it?

02:15.403 --> 02:16.337
Yeah, on the inside.

02:16.370 --> 02:17.671
Title page by the author's name.

02:17.705 --> 02:19.273
Well, shouldn't it just be
the first page

02:19.307 --> 02:20.674
so I can open it and,
boom, I sign it.

02:20.708 --> 02:22.543
No, no.
That-that page is blank.

02:22.576 --> 02:24.778
Not after I sign it.

02:24.812 --> 02:27.248
Well, you look nice.

02:27.281 --> 02:28.416
Out with Liz?

02:28.449 --> 02:29.783
Uh, I think Larry's right.

02:29.817 --> 02:32.253
You know, it's the title page.

02:32.286 --> 02:33.854
Let's see, um...

02:33.887 --> 02:36.457
Charlie Edward Eppes?

02:36.490 --> 02:37.958
Or Charlie Eppes?

02:37.991 --> 02:40.628
Or "C" dot Eppes?

02:40.661 --> 02:42.696
I think, you know,
depending on attendance,

02:42.730 --> 02:44.865
you might want to adjust
the length of the signature.

02:44.898 --> 02:46.867
All right, well, then I can use
an adaptive algorithm

02:46.900 --> 02:49.470
to adjust for variables
of time per person.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.539
Uh, so we're talking
three hours,

02:51.572 --> 02:52.873
probably less than
a thousand people,

02:52.906 --> 02:54.775
there's probably
more than-than...

02:54.808 --> 02:57.478
I'm going to need a stopwatch.

02:57.511 --> 02:58.579
(knocking on door)

02:58.612 --> 03:00.781
(turns off video game)

03:01.915 --> 03:03.484
(tapping on glass)

03:03.517 --> 03:04.418
FBI.

03:07.388 --> 03:08.989
(grunts)
(gunshot)

03:09.022 --> 03:10.224
(screams):
Steven!

03:10.258 --> 03:11.525
Mom!
Steven!

03:11.559 --> 03:12.960
Mom, come on!
(gunshot)

03:12.993 --> 03:14.528
(gunshot)
Steven!

03:14.562 --> 03:15.863
(woman screams)
Mom!

03:15.896 --> 03:18.799
(gunshot, Steven yells)
Go! Go!

03:18.832 --> 03:19.900
(gunshot)
(woman screams)

03:19.933 --> 03:21.802
Mom!
(woman grunts)

03:21.835 --> 03:24.538
Run, Steven!

03:24.572 --> 03:27.007
(alarm blaring)

03:27.040 --> 03:29.343
(three gunshots)

03:32.012 --> 03:33.747
(sirens approaching)

03:42.456 --> 03:43.591
U.S. Marshal Tricia Yaegger.

03:43.624 --> 03:44.758
FBI?

03:44.792 --> 03:46.360
Yep.

03:46.394 --> 03:47.328
The assassin gained entry

03:47.361 --> 03:50.664
to a protected household
using an FBI badge.

03:50.698 --> 03:52.400
No signs of
forced entry.

03:52.433 --> 03:53.901
She opened the door
to her own killer.

03:53.934 --> 03:55.869
Protected?
Uh, Witness Protection?

03:55.903 --> 03:57.571
Witness Security.

03:57.605 --> 03:59.607
Leah Wexford was in the program
for the last five years.

03:59.640 --> 04:00.908
So was her son, Steven.

04:00.941 --> 04:03.344
And he was shot, too?

04:03.377 --> 04:04.978
One grazed him, one
lodged in his shoulder.

04:05.012 --> 04:07.915
All right, so the killer
didn't make sure he was dead.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.517
Oh, the kid hid back there

04:09.550 --> 04:10.951
and alarm system went off.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.953
We had marshals here
in under two minutes.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.388
That's fast.

04:14.422 --> 04:16.490
Not fast enough for Leah.

04:16.524 --> 04:18.292
Looks like she was
out on a date.

04:18.326 --> 04:21.362
You guys have any idea
who she was out with?

04:21.395 --> 04:23.331
Me.

04:35.576 --> 04:38.446
I was assigned to her case
back in Albuquerque.

04:38.479 --> 04:40.448
So that must have been
about five years ago?

04:40.481 --> 04:42.049
RICO cases have a way
of never ending.

04:42.082 --> 04:43.451
Organized crime?

04:44.552 --> 04:46.019
Yeah.

04:46.053 --> 04:47.688
Her husband
was a mid-level mobster

04:47.721 --> 04:49.857
who was whacked
during the investigation.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.425
Leah Wexford
knew every person

04:51.459 --> 04:52.760
her husband spent time with,

04:52.793 --> 04:54.762
every serious player
in Albuquerque.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.097
Now, for a RICO case, that makes
her the prime witness.

04:57.130 --> 05:00.734
37 years the marshals have
been doing Witness Security.

05:00.768 --> 05:03.771
Never lost a witness.
Really? Not one?

05:03.804 --> 05:05.606
People have been killed
after they left the program.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.541
But never one actively
under our protection.

05:07.575 --> 05:10.077
Okay, all right, so,
what happened here tonight?

05:10.110 --> 05:12.346
What did happen, Eppes?

05:12.380 --> 05:13.881
Exposing a witness.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.349
Well, she needed to get out.

05:15.383 --> 05:16.484
Breaking protocol

05:16.517 --> 05:18.085
by removing her
from the safe perimeter,

05:18.118 --> 05:20.488
four times
in two months.

05:20.521 --> 05:21.889
Hold on, hold on,
you're saying Leah,

05:21.922 --> 05:23.857
she couldn't leave
her own house?

05:23.891 --> 05:24.825
Of course she could,

05:24.858 --> 05:26.026
but not in the company of a
known FBI agent.

05:26.059 --> 05:28.762
As soon as she did that, her
risk increased substantially.

05:28.796 --> 05:30.364
You know,
I still don't see your point.

05:30.398 --> 05:31.865
Agent Eppes
didn't pull the trigger.

05:31.899 --> 05:32.700
But he sure as hell

05:32.733 --> 05:34.735
brought that gunman
into this house.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.804
It sounds to me
like you guys are trying

05:36.837 --> 05:38.639
to cover your own ass.
She might be right.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.415
Hey.
Donny.

05:47.448 --> 05:48.582
Everything all right?

05:48.616 --> 05:50.551
Yeah. Uh, Charlie up?
He should be.

05:50.584 --> 05:51.685
We have early classes
this morning.

05:51.719 --> 05:52.920
There he is.

05:52.953 --> 05:55.556
Hey. Hey, what's up?
Hey, buddy.

05:55.589 --> 05:57.491
Um, just this murder last night
like, around 11:00.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.727
I need you to do
your radius thing.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.595
An escape radius?
Yeah.

06:01.629 --> 06:02.896
Wow, after that many hours,

06:02.930 --> 06:03.931
calculating
the max travel distance

06:03.964 --> 06:05.833
will be kind of...
Just give me something, okay?

06:06.900 --> 06:07.668
What's up?
Nothing.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.537
Just-just take a
look at the file.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.505
Whatever you can do,
I'd appreciate it.

06:13.941 --> 06:16.744
I'm not sure an escape radius
is the answer here,

06:16.777 --> 06:19.613
but, uh, I'll swing by
the FBI and do what I can.

06:19.647 --> 06:20.948
Well, what about your class
this morning?

06:20.981 --> 06:22.850
Oh, I don't have any class
this morning.

06:22.883 --> 06:26.787
I just... I just like carpooling
with you.

06:32.860 --> 06:33.961
All right,
so Leah Wexford testified

06:33.994 --> 06:37.765
against an Albuquerque Mob crew
run by Alfred McGurn.

06:37.798 --> 06:38.899
What did
they get them on?

06:38.932 --> 06:41.769
DAVID: Racketeering, money
laundering, black market,

06:41.802 --> 06:43.637
prostitution--
it goes on.

06:43.671 --> 06:47.007
Yeah, Jake Wexford,
Leah's husband, was connected,

06:47.040 --> 06:48.676
and they were just about
to get him to turn.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.611
And McGurn had him killed?

06:50.644 --> 06:51.745
COLBY:
Yeah.

06:51.779 --> 06:54.615
The file says that Jake Wexford
was a repeat offender.

06:54.648 --> 06:57.184
Why they put someone like that
in the program, I...

06:57.217 --> 06:58.819
Sammy Gravano killed 19 people

06:58.852 --> 07:00.621
and they used him to put
Gotti away.

07:00.654 --> 07:02.923
If the fish they're after
is big enough,

07:02.956 --> 07:06.760
they'll put anyone
in Witness Security.

07:06.794 --> 07:08.862
Looks like McGurn's case
is coming up on appeal.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.163
CHARLIE:
Hey, guys.

07:10.197 --> 07:12.165
So, Don asked me to plot
an escape radius

07:12.199 --> 07:13.601
for the shooter last night

07:13.634 --> 07:14.902
that killed a woman,
Leah Wexford.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.570
Yeah, she was a witness
in a mob case.

07:16.604 --> 07:17.938
Don was her handler.

07:17.971 --> 07:18.539
Yeah.

07:19.740 --> 07:20.874
CHARLIE:
He never mentioned that to me.

07:20.908 --> 07:23.644
Yeah, he never mentioned it
to anyone.

07:23.677 --> 07:26.614
Guys, Leah Wexford
was a protected witness.

07:26.647 --> 07:29.950
I mean, Wit Security
suppresses the information.

07:29.983 --> 07:31.985
That's why Don's
beating himself up.

07:32.019 --> 07:34.021
He was the only person
outside of Wit Sec

07:34.054 --> 07:35.188
who actually knew
where to find her.

07:35.222 --> 07:36.824
So he thinks he led
her killer to her?

07:36.857 --> 07:38.492
That's crazy.

07:38.526 --> 07:40.027
Don would never make
that kind of mistake.

07:48.135 --> 07:51.672
Another visitor,
Dr. Fleinhardt.

07:53.106 --> 07:54.508
Oh...

07:54.542 --> 07:55.776
Thank you, Brother.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.949
I don't think Brother Theo
likes me very much.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.818
It's not you, it's the world
you bring with you.

08:04.852 --> 08:06.219
Are they that way
about all visitors?

08:06.253 --> 08:07.621
That would be the problem.

08:07.655 --> 08:09.122
I'm the only one here
who has visitors.

08:09.156 --> 08:12.025
Even the "vow of silence" guys
are grumbling.

08:12.059 --> 08:13.694
(laughs softly)

08:13.727 --> 08:16.063
A woman in the witness
protection program was murdered.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.665
My brother...

08:17.698 --> 08:19.166
is blaming himself

08:19.199 --> 08:22.603
because he feels like
he led her killer to her.

08:22.636 --> 08:24.838
And you disagree
with Don's conclusion?

08:24.872 --> 08:26.039
Oh, of course.

08:26.073 --> 08:28.876
Meaning that you
emotionally disagree.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.110
Well,

08:30.143 --> 08:32.245
I mean, if you had facts
to support your theory,

08:32.279 --> 08:34.782
you'd be talking to Don
right now, not me.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.221
What if I perform
a classification

08:41.254 --> 08:43.023
and regression tree?

08:43.056 --> 08:44.257
Yeah.

08:44.291 --> 08:48.562
Yeah, CART analysis might well
uncover where he went wrong.

08:48.596 --> 08:50.130
If he went wrong.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.132
I don't know... I don't know
how comfortable I feel

08:52.165 --> 08:55.035
performing a CART analysis
on my own brother.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.137
Don already thinks he did it.

08:57.170 --> 08:59.206
I mean, truth or doubt--

08:59.239 --> 09:01.041
which will help him sleep?

09:05.913 --> 09:07.648
So the bitch is dead.

09:07.681 --> 09:10.951
You ever hear of faking remorse?

09:10.984 --> 09:12.185
I ain't gonna lie to you--

09:12.219 --> 09:14.154
one less witness is good
for me, right?

09:14.187 --> 09:14.822
It's a pretty good motive.

09:14.855 --> 09:16.624
Maybe to kill Leah Wexford.

09:16.657 --> 09:18.091
What does that mean?

09:18.125 --> 09:20.060
If you're going
to silence somebody,

09:20.093 --> 09:22.830
you silence them,
you don't shoot their children.

09:22.863 --> 09:24.231
Steven Wexford's a good kid.

09:24.264 --> 09:27.100
Whoever did this,
was after straight-up revenge.

09:27.134 --> 09:29.302
And you didn't want revenge?

09:29.336 --> 09:32.572
A lot of people in jail
because of that...

09:33.807 --> 09:36.143
Because Leah Wexford
put them there.

09:36.176 --> 09:39.079
And every one of them's
got friends.

09:39.112 --> 09:41.181
Which ones would kill kids?

09:42.282 --> 09:43.717
Well, none of mine.

09:45.318 --> 09:48.622
LIZ: Perfect vantage point to
watch the house.

09:48.656 --> 09:50.758
That's a lot of butts
for someone

09:50.791 --> 09:52.760
who just followed Don and Leah
back from a restaurant.

09:52.793 --> 09:55.929
Timeline said Don dropped her
off at 11:00.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.197
She was killed at 11:10.

09:57.230 --> 09:58.866
You can't smoke this much
in ten minutes.

09:58.899 --> 10:00.333
No, but the killer
could've waited

10:00.367 --> 10:02.335
for Don to bring her home.

10:02.369 --> 10:04.805
Or Don and Leah
come home earlier,

10:04.838 --> 10:06.807
go inside, and, uh...

10:06.840 --> 10:09.376
killer has plenty of time
to smoke his pack a day.

10:09.409 --> 10:12.212
You being an agent or
a girlfriend right now?

10:15.248 --> 10:18.786
I tried to access
Leah Wexford's file.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.053
And?

10:20.087 --> 10:21.855
And there are sealed files

10:21.889 --> 10:23.857
on Don's involvement
with the case.

10:23.891 --> 10:25.693
Sealed by Witness Security?

10:25.726 --> 10:27.227
No, sealed by the FBI.

10:27.260 --> 10:31.832
Investigation by the Office
of Professional Responsibility.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.867
Well, that could be
a million things.

10:33.901 --> 10:35.969
Doesn't mean he had
an improper relationship.

10:36.003 --> 10:38.071
TRICIA:
Old man noticed an SUV

10:38.105 --> 10:39.673
with Washington plates
parked here

10:39.707 --> 10:41.241
for two hours
the night of the murder.

10:41.274 --> 10:42.743
Right where you're standing.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.778
Did town watch happen to
write the plates down?

10:44.812 --> 10:47.247
No. But he noticed
it was a rental.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.916
A lot of rentals
here in L.A.

10:48.949 --> 10:50.350
Not so many with parking permits

10:50.383 --> 10:51.551
from the Holiday Lodge
Motel chain.

10:51.584 --> 10:54.321
Wow, did Grandpa hop in and
take a ride with our guy, too?

10:54.354 --> 10:57.758
Guy sits in a rental for a few
hours out front of my house...

10:57.791 --> 11:00.327
I don't know about you,
but I'm with Grandpa.

11:10.804 --> 11:12.305
FBI!

11:13.841 --> 11:14.775
Clear.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.243
Clear.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.815
Hey, get the techs in here fast.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.717
He's gone,
but he didn't take his car.

11:23.751 --> 11:25.052
Looks like he knew
we were coming.

11:31.058 --> 11:33.794
You don't have to stay.

11:33.827 --> 11:34.895
I'm okay.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.730
Yeah, I know.

11:36.764 --> 11:38.298
(sighs)

11:38.331 --> 11:39.733
Did my mom do something?

11:40.834 --> 11:43.103
Marshal Yaegger said...

11:43.136 --> 11:44.738
Wait, hold on.
She was here?

11:44.772 --> 11:47.340
She called.

11:47.374 --> 11:50.210
Wanted to know if my mom
had seen any old friends,

11:50.243 --> 11:51.945
friends from
Albuquerque.

11:51.979 --> 11:53.280
And had she?

11:53.313 --> 11:54.848
Just you.

11:54.882 --> 11:57.217
You're the only person
from our old life she ever saw.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.223
It hasn't even sunk in.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.926
I mean, you know, people
are treating me differently,

12:05.959 --> 12:08.195
but I don't feel any different.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.230
I-I know I should
feel something.

12:10.263 --> 12:11.765
Right?
Don't...

12:11.799 --> 12:13.333
worry about how you feel.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.307
She talks about you a lot.

12:20.340 --> 12:23.543
She thinks about
you all the time.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.847
Thought.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.148
Not thinks.

12:34.988 --> 12:37.290
Access denied?

12:37.324 --> 12:39.226
Come here
a second.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.928
We ran the fingerprints
we found in the motel

12:40.961 --> 12:42.562
and look at what we get.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.764
Try it again.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.567
Okay, so are we

12:47.600 --> 12:50.037
or are we not matching them
against the federal database?

12:50.070 --> 12:51.972
We're matching them,
but they're flagged.

12:52.005 --> 12:55.008
We're being denied access
to the owner's file.

12:55.042 --> 12:56.844
The killer is
Benny Natale.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.846
Mid-level mobster,
worked for McGurn,

12:58.879 --> 13:00.347
probably the trigger
man in the murder

13:00.380 --> 13:02.349
of Leah Wexford's
husband five years ago.

13:02.382 --> 13:03.450
Leah's testimony
convicted him.

13:03.483 --> 13:04.885
With a rap sheet
like this,

13:04.918 --> 13:07.888
his prints ought to be
all over our system.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.489
We pulled them out
five years ago.

13:09.522 --> 13:10.490
We?

13:10.523 --> 13:11.591
Witness Security.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.360
(scoffs)

13:13.393 --> 13:15.162
You're telling us
that Leah Wexford's killer

13:15.195 --> 13:16.529
is in the program, too?

13:25.172 --> 13:27.440
Five years ago, we busted
Benny Natale in New Mexico

13:27.474 --> 13:29.042
for numbers running
and drug dealing.

13:29.076 --> 13:31.478
I thought you said
he killed Jake Wexford.

13:31.511 --> 13:32.980
We could never prove it,

13:33.013 --> 13:35.849
but Leah did find evidence
against Natale

13:35.883 --> 13:38.051
in her husband's safe--
client records.

13:38.085 --> 13:39.586
Enough to put Natale
in the hot seat

13:39.619 --> 13:42.055
and get him to turn
on McGurn's crew.

13:42.089 --> 13:44.457
Mm-hmm, Witness Security
set him up in Seattle

13:44.491 --> 13:46.359
same way we set up a
house for Leah in L.A.

13:46.393 --> 13:47.594
We relocate our witnesses
to different cities.

13:47.627 --> 13:49.262
We don't want them
running into each other.

13:49.296 --> 13:50.630
All right,

13:50.663 --> 13:53.500
it looks like we're back
to the whole revenge motive.

13:53.533 --> 13:56.369
Maybe Alfred McGurn
was telling me the truth.

13:56.403 --> 13:58.638
Nice to see somebody
was on the up-and-up.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.273
What's that supposed to mean?

14:00.307 --> 14:03.176
Means you knew what
Benny Natale was capable of,

14:03.210 --> 14:04.211
yet you still protected him.

14:04.244 --> 14:05.445
If I hadn't,

14:05.478 --> 14:07.147
we wouldn't have been
able to nail McGurn.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.281
Oh, I see,

14:08.315 --> 14:11.318
so one scumbag rats out
a bigger scumbag and we pay them

14:11.351 --> 14:13.620
$60,000 a year
for the privilege,

14:13.653 --> 14:15.989
move them into a nice house
in a new city.

14:16.023 --> 14:18.058
You know how many witnesses
we had before Wit Sec?

14:19.927 --> 14:22.029
None-- IRS had to
take down Al Capone

14:22.062 --> 14:23.897
because no one would talk.
Why don't you talk

14:23.931 --> 14:27.000
to Steven Wexford, let him know
that's why his mom's dead?

14:27.034 --> 14:31.471
Natale was arrested
in Seattle six times

14:31.504 --> 14:32.973
after you moved him
there, okay?

14:33.006 --> 14:36.143
There's drugs in here,
protection scams, assault.

14:36.176 --> 14:37.344
You gave him a free pass?

14:37.377 --> 14:39.446
Checks and balances,
Agent Granger.

14:39.479 --> 14:40.413
How useful the
information is

14:40.447 --> 14:43.316
weighed against past
and present offenses.

14:43.350 --> 14:46.119
Benny Natale
went too far.

14:46.153 --> 14:47.220
You think?

14:47.254 --> 14:51.058
I just want to know
how Natale knew Leah was here.

14:51.091 --> 14:53.126
Another question is:
Where is he now?

15:02.069 --> 15:04.637
So you want to
talk about it?

15:04.671 --> 15:07.574
No.

15:07.607 --> 15:08.708
Yeah.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.244
You slept with Leah Wexford

15:11.278 --> 15:13.146
and that's why
your files are sealed.

15:13.180 --> 15:14.147
What, you looked?

15:14.181 --> 15:15.048
I tried.

15:15.082 --> 15:18.151
Then your reputation,
OPR investigation...

15:18.185 --> 15:19.719
It ended in New Mexico, Liz.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.588
I mean, I wasn't even allowed
to keep in touch.

15:21.621 --> 15:24.591
Until the appeal came up
and then she reached out to you.

15:24.624 --> 15:25.592
She was scared.

15:25.625 --> 15:26.994
And Yaegger
was right.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.962
I did, I crossed a line.

15:28.996 --> 15:31.264
Won't argue with that.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.968
Look, I get it, okay?

15:35.002 --> 15:38.605
She felt safe with you.

15:38.638 --> 15:40.007
Well, big mistake there.

15:40.040 --> 15:44.311
So that's all it was?
Just work?

15:46.179 --> 15:48.681
Okay.

15:48.715 --> 15:51.718
What else do you know
about Benny Natale?

15:51.751 --> 15:53.653
I fought with Yaegger
about putting him in Wit Sec.

15:53.686 --> 15:55.188
I tried going over her head.

15:55.222 --> 15:57.224
Not the best way
to make friends.

15:58.791 --> 15:59.993
What?

16:02.095 --> 16:04.364
Natale kills Leah.

16:04.397 --> 16:07.067
He doesn't skip town,
he goes back to the hotel?

16:07.100 --> 16:09.702
Wha-- what was he doing
in L.A. still?

16:09.736 --> 16:11.438
CHARLIE:
So...

16:11.471 --> 16:14.107
you think the killer's
still here in L.A.?

16:14.141 --> 16:15.742
All the evidence
points to it.

16:15.775 --> 16:18.445
And yet why
would he stay?

16:18.478 --> 16:20.580
That's what we're trying
to figure out.

16:20.613 --> 16:21.748
And that's

16:21.781 --> 16:23.150
Benny Natale's
Witness Security file?

16:23.183 --> 16:24.584
Yeah.

16:24.617 --> 16:27.387
Everything he's been up to
in the past five years...

16:27.420 --> 16:28.355
and before.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.625
Lawrence.

16:32.659 --> 16:33.760
Charles.
What do you think

16:33.793 --> 16:37.330
about an application
of path analysis?

16:37.364 --> 16:39.132
LARRY:
Model a pattern of behavior?

16:39.166 --> 16:40.433
Using Natale's
rap sheet

16:40.467 --> 16:42.069
to extrapolate
a predictive analysis

16:42.102 --> 16:43.270
of the choices he'll make.

16:44.337 --> 16:45.638
Sort of like a rat in a maze.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.707
We have a set
of known variables.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.776
We know the rat wants
to escape the maze.

16:49.809 --> 16:51.744
We also know that he has
other needs and desires

16:51.778 --> 16:53.813
like food, water and a mate.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.748
Separate
from what the rat wants

16:55.782 --> 16:57.717
is what the rat doesn't want--

16:57.750 --> 17:00.053
an electric shock, a dead end--

17:00.087 --> 17:01.288
and these are valid parts
of the equation

17:01.321 --> 17:02.755
known as avoidance goals.

17:02.789 --> 17:05.325
If Natale's staying in L.A.,

17:05.358 --> 17:07.227
there must be
something he desires

17:07.260 --> 17:08.361
that outweighs
his avoidance goals.

17:08.395 --> 17:09.596
You think
you can figure out

17:09.629 --> 17:11.398
what he wants so badly?

17:11.431 --> 17:13.533
We can take a
stab at it.

17:13.566 --> 17:15.335
All right, I'll let Don know.
Thanks.

17:15.368 --> 17:16.736
Right.

17:16.769 --> 17:17.804
Well,

17:17.837 --> 17:20.840
you certainly do have
your work cut out for you.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.443
Classification

17:23.476 --> 17:25.345
and regression tree, huh?

17:26.813 --> 17:29.716
You know, it seems to me,
you had some misgivings

17:29.749 --> 17:33.120
about performing a CART analysis
on Don's decisions.

17:33.153 --> 17:34.621
I still do.

17:34.654 --> 17:35.722
And yet...

17:35.755 --> 17:38.558
And yet.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.593
If Don's hypothesis
is correct

17:40.627 --> 17:44.697
and he really is responsible
for Leah's death...

17:46.666 --> 17:49.469
He doesn't have
to know about it.

18:00.380 --> 18:01.781
Thank you.

18:07.887 --> 18:10.190
CHARLIE:
Benny Natale's storied past

18:10.223 --> 18:12.692
gave me all the variables
I needed to put together

18:12.725 --> 18:14.361
a triangular
path coefficient.

18:14.394 --> 18:15.795
We've got his history
in New Mexico,

18:15.828 --> 18:17.464
we have his criminal associates,

18:17.497 --> 18:18.898
and we have
his countless drug busts

18:18.931 --> 18:20.733
in both New Mexico and Seattle.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.236
Now, all those variables
helped me formulate

18:23.270 --> 18:25.738
a path analysis that
will help identify

18:25.772 --> 18:28.341
his prime motivation
for staying in L.A.

18:28.375 --> 18:29.509
DAVID:
Drugs.

18:29.542 --> 18:30.477
CHARLIE:
Probably cocaine.

18:30.510 --> 18:31.744
That fits his M.O.,

18:31.778 --> 18:33.813
but there are a lot of places
to buy cocaine in Los Angeles.

18:33.846 --> 18:35.782
Well, in creating
this path coefficient,

18:35.815 --> 18:37.684
I came to one
very obvious conclusion--

18:37.717 --> 18:38.851
that history can't change,
right?

18:38.885 --> 18:40.320
Drugs are pretty much
the same

18:40.353 --> 18:41.788
in New Mexico and Seattle
and Los Angeles,

18:41.821 --> 18:44.491
but the "people" variable,
that had to change.

18:44.524 --> 18:45.925
Right, because his
contacts in New Mexico,

18:45.958 --> 18:46.959
they want him killed.

18:46.993 --> 18:48.761
Right, he had to find
a new element to work with--

18:48.795 --> 18:51.764
a prominent Seattle-based
African-American gang.

18:51.798 --> 18:52.999
All right, because
it works in Seattle,

18:53.032 --> 18:55.302
it should work in Los Angeles,
at least in this guy's mind.

18:55.335 --> 18:56.703
That's exactly it;
the probability is

18:56.736 --> 18:58.838
that he would employ the
same strategy in Los Angeles,

18:58.871 --> 19:01.341
and now we know
his base of operations

19:01.374 --> 19:02.742
is the Holiday Lodge Motel.

19:02.775 --> 19:04.444
That helps me to predict
his future movements.

19:04.477 --> 19:05.412
All right,
so you're saying

19:05.445 --> 19:06.779
by figuring out
what he was doing,

19:06.813 --> 19:09.682
you can make a pretty good guess
as to where he's doing it.

19:09.716 --> 19:12.852
So Natale's working
around here somewhere

19:12.885 --> 19:14.354
and that's a
fairly large area,

19:14.387 --> 19:15.722
so I can't get more
geographically specific

19:15.755 --> 19:16.723
without having
more precise values

19:16.756 --> 19:17.957
for some of
the variables.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.792
Oh, yeah, wait, let me see.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.529
Right here, bro,
that area.

19:22.562 --> 19:24.764
What, AP47 turf?

19:24.797 --> 19:26.533
Yeah, that's
the AP47 gang.

19:26.566 --> 19:28.535
We'll need the FBI
Gang Task Force.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.270
I'll call 'em in.

19:30.303 --> 19:31.804
All right, I'm off

19:31.838 --> 19:33.640
to my book signing or else I'm
gonna be late. -Wait, wait,

19:33.673 --> 19:35.708
I thought that was,
uh, tomorrow night.

19:35.742 --> 19:37.344
When was the last time
you slept, bro?

19:37.377 --> 19:38.778
I'm sorry, I can't go.

19:38.811 --> 19:39.979
I didn't expect you to,

19:40.012 --> 19:41.514
but it'd be kind
of messed up

19:41.548 --> 19:42.982
if I didn't show, though, right?
Yeah.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.584
Okay.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.693
MAN:
It looks like your killer

19:53.726 --> 19:56.229
is working
with the AP47 gang.

19:56.263 --> 19:57.764
The mope on the left
is Zeke Gibbs,

19:57.797 --> 19:59.366
one of their top lieutenants.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.368
This was taken, like,
what, 14 hours ago?

20:01.401 --> 20:03.603
What the hell
is going on here, Eppes?

20:03.636 --> 20:05.305
Hey, this is Chris
Frederickson.

20:05.338 --> 20:07.607
He runs the
AP47 task force.

20:07.640 --> 20:08.708
Take a look.

20:08.741 --> 20:09.809
See what your boy
Natale's up to.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.711
FREDERICKSON: Major drug deal
going down tonight.

20:11.744 --> 20:13.780
We've been tracking it for
weeks, didn't know the buyer.

20:13.813 --> 20:14.747
Now we do.

20:14.781 --> 20:16.416
I promise you, as soon
as he pays for the coke,

20:16.449 --> 20:17.817
Natale's all yours.

20:17.850 --> 20:18.685
No, no, no,
no, uh-uh.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.553
No way. -Eppes, Eppes, I need
this guy.

20:20.587 --> 20:22.789
Man's got a point.
We get a two-fer.

20:22.822 --> 20:24.624
What? What is the deal?

20:24.657 --> 20:25.958
Why do you keep protecting
the guy?

20:25.992 --> 20:27.527
Why are you so close to this?

20:28.695 --> 20:30.763
Look... Eppes,

20:30.797 --> 20:33.333
it's your case,
it's your choice.

20:33.366 --> 20:35.935
Wait a few hours,
we both win.

20:35.968 --> 20:37.570
I get my guy
and you get yours.

20:37.604 --> 20:39.872
Come on,
think about it.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.882
You are too close.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.818
What, should I just
let them run with it?

20:51.851 --> 20:53.920
What would you do
if it were any other case?

21:05.332 --> 21:07.867
Hi, Charlie. -Oh, good, I
thought I was late.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.902
Well....

21:09.936 --> 21:11.003
Did no one show up?

21:11.037 --> 21:12.839
Charlie, the book just came
out, there's no publicity.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.073
What do you want?

21:14.106 --> 21:17.877
Well... I guess, one day, we'll
look back at this and laugh.

21:17.910 --> 21:19.412
Right?
Yeah.

21:19.446 --> 21:20.880
You can tell this story
to Oprah.

21:20.913 --> 21:22.882
(Charlie and Alan laughing)
Professor Eppes.

21:22.915 --> 21:24.584
Can you sign this
for me?

21:24.617 --> 21:25.718
Uh, absolutely.

21:26.819 --> 21:27.920
Well, I hope so.

21:27.954 --> 21:31.891
I mean, uh, I'm kind of
an autograph virgin, actually.

21:31.924 --> 21:33.593
My name is Allyson
with a "Y."

21:33.626 --> 21:35.828
Okay, Allyson with a "Y."

21:35.862 --> 21:39.799
"Peace, love,
and math."

21:39.832 --> 21:40.933
(chuckles)

21:42.001 --> 21:43.069
"Charlie"...

21:43.102 --> 21:44.404
E-P-P-E-S.

21:44.437 --> 21:46.739
Thank you.

21:46.773 --> 21:47.840
This is my father.
(laughing)

21:47.874 --> 21:50.009
All righty.

21:50.042 --> 21:51.444
Don't read it all in one night.

21:51.478 --> 21:52.945
(both laughing)
Okay.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.781
Thank you. -Hey, Charles, if,
uh, if you don't mind...

21:54.814 --> 21:55.982
What are you doing?

21:56.015 --> 21:56.983
Well, I figure,

21:57.016 --> 21:58.951
since we have so much
time, uh, do you mind?

21:58.985 --> 22:00.853
Oh, no. You know what?
That's very sweet,

22:00.887 --> 22:02.355
but you don't have to do that.

22:02.389 --> 22:03.923
Don't have to?
What do you mean, have to?

22:03.956 --> 22:05.558
No, you're not a parent,
you don't understand.

22:05.592 --> 22:07.527
This is for me. I'm going to
give one to everyone I know.

22:07.560 --> 22:10.029
I mean, it's just...
just a book, you know?

22:10.062 --> 22:11.097
A book? Come on!

22:11.130 --> 22:12.765
It's my son's book.

22:21.974 --> 22:23.976
Okay, wake up.
We have eyes on Natale.

22:27.447 --> 22:28.715
Here comes Gibbs.

22:30.717 --> 22:31.951
Coke should be in the bag.

22:31.984 --> 22:35.522
When they make the sell,
we'll take them all.

22:42.094 --> 22:43.563
You all right, man?

22:43.596 --> 22:45.998
Yeah. You all right?

22:46.032 --> 22:47.767
I'm fine.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.002
NATALE: I'm going to reach in
here and give you my cash.

22:50.036 --> 22:53.005
(jacket zipper opening)

22:53.039 --> 22:54.474
You can count it.

22:54.507 --> 22:56.443
It's all there.

23:00.547 --> 23:03.015
We good?

23:03.049 --> 23:06.586
That sack look
right to you?

23:06.619 --> 23:07.987
Looks a little
light, doesn't it?

23:08.020 --> 23:09.556
Yeah, something's hinky.

23:09.589 --> 23:10.490
No problem, man.

23:11.691 --> 23:13.092
Go! Go! Go!

23:13.125 --> 23:15.662
Shots fired. Shots fired.
Natale's down.

23:15.695 --> 23:16.429
FBI!

23:16.463 --> 23:17.063
Freeze!

23:17.096 --> 23:18.064
LIZ:
Freeze!

23:18.097 --> 23:19.098
COLBY:
Get down!

23:19.131 --> 23:20.032
Get down!

23:20.066 --> 23:21.167
Let's go.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.970
Get down on the ground
and turn around!

23:24.003 --> 23:25.171
I got Gibbs.

23:41.721 --> 23:44.023
*

23:55.535 --> 23:58.070
You have the right
to remain silent.

23:58.104 --> 24:00.072
Anything you say...

24:00.106 --> 24:01.941
I don't think he
can hear you, bud.

24:08.681 --> 24:10.883
DAVID:
Natale's dead.

24:10.917 --> 24:12.685
Self-defense.

24:12.719 --> 24:14.587
I feared for my life.

24:14.621 --> 24:15.955
You shot him
in cold blood, Zeke.

24:15.988 --> 24:17.156
GIBBS:
And I had to.

24:17.189 --> 24:20.059
I got word this dude Natale
was planning on smoking my ass,

24:20.092 --> 24:21.894
walking away with the product
and the money.

24:21.928 --> 24:22.962
Word from who?

24:24.631 --> 24:25.665
Text message.

24:25.698 --> 24:27.133
No return number.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.836
Give us your phone,
we'll check it out, come on.

24:29.869 --> 24:31.604
I ditched it.

24:31.638 --> 24:32.639
Come on, man,
I only keep a phone

24:32.672 --> 24:34.273
for a week or so, you know?
It's bad business

24:34.306 --> 24:36.943
to have a family plan,
you know what I mean?

24:36.976 --> 24:38.778
DAVID: Ah, I see, so, you're
going to go

24:38.811 --> 24:41.180
for this anonymous
guardian angel defense, huh?

24:41.213 --> 24:43.516
Natale was a shooter
for the Mob.

24:43.550 --> 24:45.618
I mean, I take that seriously.

24:45.652 --> 24:47.086
DAVID:
You know what, Zeke?

24:47.119 --> 24:49.589
It's going to be
a hard case to make,

24:49.622 --> 24:51.691
especially since we didn't
find a gun on Natale.

24:51.724 --> 24:52.859
Say what?

24:52.892 --> 24:55.127
DAVID:
No, we didn't.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.296
Man, the dude
didn't have a gun?

24:57.329 --> 24:58.164
Then someone
set me up.

24:58.197 --> 24:59.699
FREDERICKSON:
Guy threw away his phone,

24:59.732 --> 25:01.601
threw away his defense,
I got a case.

25:01.634 --> 25:02.935
Yeah, well, not till I'm done.

25:02.969 --> 25:04.136
Done with him?
What are you talking about?

25:04.170 --> 25:06.939
Natale is over. You don't even
have to take him to trial.

25:06.973 --> 25:08.941
He didn't have a gun.
What if the guy's right?

25:08.975 --> 25:10.309
I mean, it does
smell like a setup.

25:10.342 --> 25:11.310
Guy's a gangbanger.

25:11.343 --> 25:12.912
Saw a chance
to roll some guy

25:12.945 --> 25:14.313
from Seattle
for a pile of cash.

25:14.346 --> 25:17.316
Anyway, ship's sailed.

25:17.349 --> 25:20.286
Zeke Gibbs has cut a deal
to roll on AP47 gang.

25:20.319 --> 25:21.954
Yaegger's doing
the paperwork now.

25:21.988 --> 25:23.322
Whoa, you're putting him
in Wit Sec?

25:23.355 --> 25:24.691
Cost of doing
business, Eppes.

25:24.724 --> 25:28.260
A small one to shut down AP47.

25:30.763 --> 25:32.732
You know, some
historians blame Rasputin

25:32.765 --> 25:34.333
for the fall of
Tsarist Russia

25:34.366 --> 25:35.434
and the rise
of Communism,

25:35.467 --> 25:38.905
and even he didn't get ousted
from his monastery.

25:38.938 --> 25:40.607
Oh, are...

25:40.640 --> 25:43.075
Are they kicking you
out of here?

25:43.109 --> 25:46.212
The calligraphy is on the wall.

25:46.245 --> 25:49.649
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

25:49.682 --> 25:51.818
I brought you
a signed copy of my book.

25:51.851 --> 25:52.819
Pretty cool, huh?

25:52.852 --> 25:54.320
And you know,
if any of the monks

25:54.353 --> 25:56.022
want a signed copy,
you'll let me know?

25:56.055 --> 25:59.659
I sense you didn't come here
for a book signing.

25:59.692 --> 26:01.928
It's my CART analysis.
I can't get an answer.

26:01.961 --> 26:03.663
I thought the killer was...

26:03.696 --> 26:05.798
Dead, and yet, Don is still
taking responsibility

26:05.832 --> 26:07.233
for that woman's death.

26:07.266 --> 26:10.369
Yeah, but, I mean,
now that you know the identity

26:10.402 --> 26:12.672
and the goal of the assassin,

26:12.705 --> 26:15.975
I mean, your CART should be
a relatively simple process.

26:16.008 --> 26:18.044
I studied the public data,

26:18.077 --> 26:20.713
and I found sealed files on Don,

26:20.747 --> 26:22.682
so whatever decision path

26:22.715 --> 26:24.350
he embarked on days ago,

26:24.383 --> 26:27.787
I think the answer may lie
in those files from years ago.

26:27.820 --> 26:31.724
You know, we might be able
to gain our answer.

26:32.992 --> 26:35.127
By focusing not
on what is there,

26:35.161 --> 26:37.096
but on what is not there.

26:38.865 --> 26:40.933
All right.

26:42.969 --> 26:45.972
A woman in profile.

26:46.005 --> 26:49.041
Facing another woman,
also in profile.

26:49.075 --> 26:52.712
But if we shade
in the center...

26:52.745 --> 26:54.647
It becomes a vase.

26:56.749 --> 26:57.784
Value shaded reasoning.

26:57.817 --> 27:00.953
If you have all the data
except those sealed files,

27:00.987 --> 27:03.422
we may well have enough shade

27:03.455 --> 27:05.391
to complete
your regression tree.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.229
DON: Hey, hey, I'm not done with
Gibbs, all right?

27:10.262 --> 27:11.764
I still got questions
about Natale.

27:11.798 --> 27:12.899
It's a drug
deal gone bad.

27:12.932 --> 27:13.900
No mystery there.

27:13.933 --> 27:16.268
Oh, what, you in a hurry
to protect another one?

27:16.302 --> 27:18.137
Is that it? -You still don't get
it, Eppes.

27:18.170 --> 27:20.439
What this game is all about--
speed, get them while you can.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.074
Oh, you are quite
the cynic, huh?

27:22.108 --> 27:24.076
I think you slept with Leah
for her testimony.

27:24.110 --> 27:26.045
It was a little
sleazy, but it worked.

27:26.078 --> 27:27.714
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

27:27.747 --> 27:29.281
You bang a lot of agents.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.918
It was only a matter of time
before you hit a witness.

27:31.951 --> 27:33.753
You get Gibbs
when I'm done with him.

27:33.786 --> 27:36.055
In four hours, I'll have
a judge's order for custody.

27:36.088 --> 27:38.057
LIZ: Four hours, and then Gibbs
disappears

27:38.090 --> 27:39.692
down Yaegger's
rabbit hole.

27:39.726 --> 27:41.360
Just like Natale did
five years ago.

27:41.393 --> 27:43.062
Gibbs is a
businessman, though.

27:43.095 --> 27:45.364
You don't just go killing
customers for no good reason.

27:45.397 --> 27:47.233
Well, that argues that
he's telling the truth

27:47.266 --> 27:49.401
and someone set him up.

27:49.435 --> 27:50.970
Yeah, these were not
unconnected events.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.805
I mean, someone used Natale
to kill Leah,

27:52.839 --> 27:54.206
and then used Gibbs
to kill Natale.

27:54.240 --> 27:56.308
Someone who benefited
from Natale's death.

27:56.342 --> 27:57.376
And Leah's.

28:01.013 --> 28:04.016
Hey, look, you know, you
don't have to go in there.

28:04.050 --> 28:07.253
I mean, we got plenty of people
that can pack up for you.

28:07.286 --> 28:10.122
Yeah, I have
to do it myself.

28:10.156 --> 28:11.423
I have to go home.

28:11.457 --> 28:13.392
Yeah.

28:14.493 --> 28:16.462
I hear you.

28:16.495 --> 28:18.197
My aunt's in there.

28:18.230 --> 28:19.966
It's okay.

28:19.999 --> 28:22.869
Whoa, don't go taking care
of me now.

28:22.902 --> 28:23.502
(quiet laugh)

28:23.535 --> 28:25.037
You look like you need it.

28:25.071 --> 28:27.006
Yeah.

28:31.811 --> 28:33.746
I know it gets better.

28:37.183 --> 28:39.752
I think what happens is
it gets less.

28:39.786 --> 28:42.855
The weight will
always be there.

28:44.523 --> 28:46.926
Forever?

28:50.062 --> 28:52.164
You know, eventually,
you end up hoping so.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.102
Natale shot the Wexford kid.

28:56.135 --> 28:57.203
He got what he deserved.

28:57.236 --> 28:59.205
It just keeps getting better
and better for you, huh?

28:59.238 --> 29:01.774
How grief-struck
am I supposed to be?

29:01.808 --> 29:03.142
Natale ratted me out.

29:03.175 --> 29:05.111
We have two people
who can put you in prison.

29:05.144 --> 29:06.278
Now they're both dead.

29:06.312 --> 29:07.379
YAEGGER:
Agent Sinclair,

29:07.413 --> 29:08.547
break it up.

29:08.580 --> 29:09.982
We're prosecuting McGurn,
not you.

29:10.016 --> 29:11.117
What the hell are
you talking about?

29:11.150 --> 29:11.984
I'm talking about cooperation.

29:12.018 --> 29:13.920
You don't give it,
you don't get it.

29:13.953 --> 29:15.154
Get him out of here.

29:15.187 --> 29:16.989
You've been done with
him for five years.

29:17.023 --> 29:19.058
He's important to
our case right now.

29:19.091 --> 29:21.027
I don't get to watch
the cops fight?

29:21.060 --> 29:22.094
Tell you what.

29:22.128 --> 29:24.964
When I get Gibbs,
you can talk to McGurn again.

29:29.969 --> 29:34.841
So, you think McGurn's
responsible for Leah's death?

29:34.874 --> 29:36.442
Exactly.

29:36.475 --> 29:38.177
I mean,
that's the thing, though.

29:38.210 --> 29:41.147
I mean, if you somehow
could find a way to connect

29:41.180 --> 29:46.052
Gibbs to McGurn, you know,
then we're in business.

29:46.085 --> 29:48.020
Yeah, well, let's see, uh,
I can start

29:48.054 --> 29:50.489
by applying a multi-application
reservoir simulator

29:50.522 --> 29:52.258
to compare McGurn's past crimes

29:52.291 --> 29:55.527
with what he's most likely
to pull next.

29:55.561 --> 29:56.863
What is all this?

29:56.896 --> 29:59.265
Huh?

29:59.298 --> 30:01.267
Don, Leah.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.502
That's what's called
a classification

30:03.535 --> 30:05.872
and regression tree analysis.

30:05.905 --> 30:07.173
CART for short.
What are you doing?

30:07.206 --> 30:08.107
You're studying me?

30:08.140 --> 30:10.977
I don't think
you led Leah to her death.

30:11.010 --> 30:12.111
I'm trying to prove it.

30:15.414 --> 30:16.849
And, so?

30:16.883 --> 30:20.319
Yeah, and so,
I began by studying the case,

30:20.352 --> 30:23.389
looking at all the connections
between all the players,

30:23.422 --> 30:26.158
trying to analyze
the decisions you made,

30:26.192 --> 30:28.027
based on the facts
you had at the time.

30:28.060 --> 30:30.863
No, because all decisions start
somewhere and grow like a tree.

30:30.897 --> 30:34.233
Choices made, until at the end,
they become complex branches

30:34.266 --> 30:36.102
of decision making,
good or bad.

30:36.135 --> 30:38.270
And then I work backwards,
pruning the tree's branches

30:38.304 --> 30:40.572
by assigning values
to each decision made,

30:40.606 --> 30:42.074
then comparing those values,

30:42.108 --> 30:43.910
pitting what
could've happened

30:43.943 --> 30:45.377
against what actually happened.

30:45.411 --> 30:48.147
And I have to tell you,
Don, you know,

30:48.180 --> 30:50.182
the probability
is quite low

30:50.216 --> 30:51.550
that any decision you made,

30:51.583 --> 30:54.186
any action you took,
led her to her death.

30:54.220 --> 30:57.123
Okay, so then,
what's this here?

30:57.156 --> 30:59.959
Well, that's the hole
that I'm working on right now.

30:59.992 --> 31:01.227
Let me ask you something.

31:01.260 --> 31:02.628
Is there an element

31:02.661 --> 31:05.197
to your relationship with her
that you've omitted?

31:09.668 --> 31:11.637
Yeah, Charlie, there is.

31:11.670 --> 31:13.272
Okay.

31:13.305 --> 31:15.041
Okay.

31:15.074 --> 31:16.208
Let me ask
you something.

31:16.242 --> 31:17.576
Is there any way you think

31:17.609 --> 31:19.511
this thing can
connect Gibbs to McGurn?

31:19.545 --> 31:21.047
Absolutely.

31:25.317 --> 31:26.452
What do you
want, Eppes?

31:26.485 --> 31:27.686
Gibbs is already
in our custody.

31:27.719 --> 31:29.956
Yeah, for now.

31:33.259 --> 31:35.127
DON: See, funny thing kept
happening

31:35.161 --> 31:37.596
when Charlie tried to connect
McGurn to the killings.

31:37.629 --> 31:39.198
One name kept popping up.

31:39.231 --> 31:40.967
Yeah.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.034
Yours.

31:42.068 --> 31:44.303
Gibbs mentioned that he met
with Natale before,

31:44.336 --> 31:45.637
but there's no
record of Natale

31:45.671 --> 31:47.539
making a previous
trip to Los Angeles.

31:47.573 --> 31:49.208
Nothing.

31:49.241 --> 31:50.609
Just happened to be wiped
from the file.

31:50.642 --> 31:53.145
Just like you wiped his
fingerprints from our database.

31:53.179 --> 31:56.082
I don't know
what you're talking about.

31:56.115 --> 31:58.951
How much did McGurn pay you
to set this all up?

32:00.319 --> 32:02.621
You're way off base.

32:02.654 --> 32:04.156
That's not what the facts say.

32:04.190 --> 32:05.124
Here's a fact
you're missing.

32:05.157 --> 32:08.260
McGurn had no reason
to kill Leah or Natale.

32:08.294 --> 32:09.528
COLBY:
No reason, huh?

32:09.561 --> 32:10.629
I mean, two
witnesses short

32:10.662 --> 32:12.064
at his appeal.

32:12.098 --> 32:13.565
Sounds like
a pretty smart play to me.

32:13.599 --> 32:16.335
Except there won't be an appeal.

32:16.368 --> 32:17.603
We've spent
the last year

32:17.636 --> 32:19.105
working on a deal
for McGurn

32:19.138 --> 32:20.606
to turn against the rest
of the Albuquerque Mob.

32:22.308 --> 32:23.976
The deal just made.

32:24.010 --> 32:25.177
COLBY:
So you're putting

32:25.211 --> 32:27.279
McGurn into
Witness Security now?

32:27.313 --> 32:28.414
Don't go spreading that around.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.182
It's confidential.

32:30.216 --> 32:31.717
I'm not your enemy.

32:34.520 --> 32:38.057
And McGurn's not your man.

32:38.090 --> 32:40.192
Sorry, I thought we had Yaegger,
but it's very difficult

32:40.226 --> 32:41.760
to achieve any type
of certainty

32:41.793 --> 32:43.695
when there are variables
being kept secret.

32:43.729 --> 32:45.964
All right, they're just bringing
Gibbs to a safe house today.

32:47.399 --> 32:50.136
Oh. So I see you finished.

32:50.169 --> 32:51.470
Yeah.

32:51.503 --> 32:53.105
Yeah, well...

32:53.139 --> 32:55.174
how did I turn out?

32:55.207 --> 32:56.275
Well, I skirted a few things,

32:56.308 --> 32:59.378
but I didn't find any major
errors in your judgment.

32:59.411 --> 33:00.712
So what does that mean?

33:00.746 --> 33:04.250
Don, I became aware of some
sealed files at the FBI;

33:04.283 --> 33:05.384
files on you.

33:07.486 --> 33:09.221
So, you got clearance.

33:09.255 --> 33:11.223
Yeah, but I wouldn't do that.

33:11.257 --> 33:14.293
I was having an affair with her,
all right?

33:14.326 --> 33:16.262
Years ago.
That's what you'd find.

33:16.295 --> 33:18.130
Hearings and reprimands.

33:18.164 --> 33:19.698
You were out with Leah
a few days ago?

33:19.731 --> 33:21.700
Yeah, as a friend.
Period.

33:24.303 --> 33:26.472
Yaegger thinks I was using her.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.307
Well, Yaegger's wrong.
I don't know.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.209
Well, it depends how
you look at it, right?

33:30.242 --> 33:31.177
We got Natale.
We got McGurn.

33:31.210 --> 33:32.278
We're about to take down the
whole Albuquerque

33:32.311 --> 33:33.779
infrastructure.

33:33.812 --> 33:35.647
All because I slept with her
five years ago.

33:35.681 --> 33:38.250
Yeah, well, using your logic,
I could make the case that,

33:38.284 --> 33:40.352
without your relationship
with Leah, her and Steven

33:40.386 --> 33:41.587
would've died
five years ago.

33:41.620 --> 33:43.255
So all we really
know for sure

33:43.289 --> 33:45.257
is that Leah made
a courageous decision,

33:45.291 --> 33:48.660
and you blaming yourself
actually lessens her bravery.

33:52.364 --> 33:54.200
What else was in those files?

33:54.233 --> 33:55.634
Everything.

33:55.667 --> 33:58.237
Was Leah's current address
in those files?

33:58.270 --> 34:00.239
Sure.

34:00.272 --> 34:02.274
What, who else had access
to 'em?

34:02.308 --> 34:03.675
Anyone with
the right clearance levels.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.444
Can you use your clearance
to get in?

34:05.477 --> 34:06.245
I mean legally.

34:06.278 --> 34:08.214
I can look at access
logs legally.

34:08.247 --> 34:11.483
Yeah.
So... sealed files

34:11.517 --> 34:13.385
leave an electronic fingerprint
every time they're opened.

34:13.419 --> 34:16.788
If someone accessed
your sealed file...

34:18.890 --> 34:21.127
Check it out.

34:22.794 --> 34:25.297
Someone did access your file.

34:27.333 --> 34:29.301
And used me to get to her.

34:37.509 --> 34:39.311
TRICIA:
Hey.

34:39.345 --> 34:40.379
What's the story?

34:40.412 --> 34:41.180
We're moving Gibbs

34:41.213 --> 34:42.614
to the safe house shortly.
All right.

34:42.648 --> 34:43.815
All right, listen.

34:43.849 --> 34:45.184
Yeah.
I want a piece.

34:48.387 --> 34:49.688
Piece of what?

34:49.721 --> 34:51.123
TRICIA (over radio):
I know you accessed

34:51.157 --> 34:53.359
Eppes' files just days
before Leah's murder.

34:53.392 --> 34:55.627
And I know how you
found Natale.

34:55.661 --> 34:57.629
You busted him
the first time

34:57.663 --> 34:59.565
he made a drug deal
with Gibbs.

34:59.598 --> 35:01.300
Then you made him
snitch for you.

35:01.333 --> 35:04.136
The arrest report falls
into the shredder.

35:04.170 --> 35:05.371
Right?

35:05.404 --> 35:06.605
You think I'd cut a deal

35:06.638 --> 35:07.673
with a scumbag
like Natale?

35:07.706 --> 35:10.576
You were the one who told Natale
where Leah lived.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.244
You traded Leah's life

35:12.278 --> 35:15.214
to get Natale to go into that
drug deal as your informant.

35:15.247 --> 35:19.451
Then you set him up to
get killed by Gibbs.

35:19.485 --> 35:21.253
A neat line
of dominos.

35:21.287 --> 35:23.622
What've you got
to keep me quiet?

35:31.663 --> 35:32.631
Nice try, Eppes!

35:32.664 --> 35:34.866
I've been winning
this game

35:34.900 --> 35:37.369
a lot longer than
you've been playing it.

35:39.871 --> 35:41.707
CHARLIE:
Yeah, it was Frederickson.

35:41.740 --> 35:43.609
He was the only one who had
access Don and Leah's files.

35:43.642 --> 35:45.711
And he knew her address;
he knew where she lived.

35:45.744 --> 35:47.246
Well, we need
a confession.

35:47.279 --> 35:48.814
I tried. Sorry.

35:48.847 --> 35:51.317
There's no way he's
getting away with killing Leah.

35:51.350 --> 35:52.718
There's nothing
odd in Gibbs'

35:52.751 --> 35:53.585
attorney room video.

35:53.619 --> 35:54.820
He didn't say anything
we could pick up

35:54.853 --> 35:56.355
at least.
And there he is,

35:56.388 --> 35:58.624
making his deal with Gibbs,
getting his witness.

35:58.657 --> 36:00.692
Are there any other visits?
Uh, yeah, a few.

36:00.726 --> 36:05.764
Uh, mom, some friends came...
girlfriend...

36:05.797 --> 36:08.367
Whoa, whoa-- hold it right
there-- yeah, back up.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.702
DON:
Let me see that.

36:10.736 --> 36:12.371
Yeah.

36:12.404 --> 36:13.972
Give me a hi-def on that,
all right?

36:14.005 --> 36:15.974
LIZ: You think he passed her a
message?

36:16.007 --> 36:18.377
Gangs in Pelican Bay have
been encoding messages

36:18.410 --> 36:19.745
in jailhouse artwork
for years.

36:19.778 --> 36:23.382
Sort of like a...
like a street steganography.

36:23.415 --> 36:24.383
You know what?

36:24.416 --> 36:25.484
May I?
Yeah.

36:25.517 --> 36:27.586
Someone in AP47

36:27.619 --> 36:29.388
has the template
to that image.

36:29.421 --> 36:31.423
Overlay it over Gibbs' artwork

36:31.457 --> 36:33.625
and all that's left is
the hidden message.

36:36.528 --> 36:37.229
Hey, so listen--

36:37.263 --> 36:38.297
I can use a simple
morphological

36:38.330 --> 36:40.899
image cleaning algorithm
to find this hidden message.

36:40.932 --> 36:44.836
It's like a paleontologist
working at a dig site.

36:44.870 --> 36:47.239
She knows there's a skeleton
underneath all that dirt,

36:47.273 --> 36:48.674
but she has to remove
all the dirt

36:48.707 --> 36:50.509
to find out exactly
what the skeleton is.

36:50.542 --> 36:52.744
This morphological algorithm
I'm talking about

36:52.778 --> 36:55.013
was originally designed
to save corrupted images,

36:55.046 --> 36:56.848
yet it's proved quite useful

36:56.882 --> 36:58.850
in smoothing out
gray-scale images,

36:58.884 --> 37:01.787
removing the camouflage,
revealing the thin features

37:01.820 --> 37:03.689
where the hidden
message resides.

37:03.722 --> 37:05.257
All right,
so how long?

37:05.291 --> 37:07.393
Might want to get yourself
a cup of coffee.

37:34.019 --> 37:36.455
10809 Rubio.

37:36.488 --> 37:37.589
Wait, hold on.

37:37.623 --> 37:39.591
That's the FBI safe house
where Gibbs is being held.

37:39.625 --> 37:41.593
He passed it to his gang.
-Why?

37:41.627 --> 37:43.595
His gang is
who he's hiding from, right?

37:43.629 --> 37:45.797
Wait, what if he's been
playing Frederickson?

37:45.831 --> 37:48.066
All right, Gibbs goes
along with Wit Sec,

37:48.099 --> 37:49.801
gets himself moved out of high
security-- -Right.

37:49.835 --> 37:52.771
Gets his gang
to bust him out, right?

38:15.461 --> 38:17.563
(tires screeching)

38:23.802 --> 38:25.471
Don't even think about it.

38:33.945 --> 38:35.414
(knocking)

38:39.685 --> 38:40.652
Expecting someone else?

38:40.686 --> 38:42.588
All right, get your hands
behind your back.

38:42.621 --> 38:43.655
Come on.

38:43.689 --> 38:45.457
Y'all ain't got
nothing on me, man.

38:45.491 --> 38:47.559
You can ride home
with your boys, go ahead.

38:47.593 --> 38:48.694
What are you doing
with my witness?

38:48.727 --> 38:50.896
I'm arresting him
for conspiracy.

38:52.464 --> 38:53.365
To kill you.

38:53.399 --> 38:54.966
Yeah, I know you're
the one that set me up.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.668
My brothers know it, too.

38:56.702 --> 38:57.969
Come on.
You're dead, homie.

38:58.003 --> 38:59.671
You're just still
breathin', that's all!

38:59.705 --> 39:01.339
(door closes)

39:02.974 --> 39:05.010
Looks like Eppes
just saved your life.

39:05.043 --> 39:07.579
I didn't set him up.
He's lying.

39:07.613 --> 39:10.549
So what do you think the life
expectancy is of a gang target

39:10.582 --> 39:11.817
there, Trish?
Could be days.

39:14.620 --> 39:15.821
I want protection.

39:15.854 --> 39:17.055
I want a confession.

39:17.088 --> 39:19.691
Witness Security and I'll deal.

39:19.725 --> 39:21.660
Pelican Bay C-block,
that's what you're going to get.

39:23.028 --> 39:25.597
Why are you doing this, man?

39:25.631 --> 39:27.132
Because you have to ask why.

39:32.971 --> 39:34.072
I needed Gibbs.

39:34.105 --> 39:36.442
He's the key
to taking down AP47.

39:36.475 --> 39:38.176
(groans)
You telling me you don't

39:38.209 --> 39:39.978
make compromises, trades...

39:40.011 --> 39:41.012
Not with people's lives.

39:41.046 --> 39:42.581
Leah was one person.

39:42.614 --> 39:46.685
Take down AP47 and you save
hundreds... thousands!

39:46.718 --> 39:48.687
You pick up
a newspaper

39:48.720 --> 39:51.923
and read about a gang shooting,
it's on you, man.

39:53.158 --> 39:54.460
Can you live with that?

39:54.493 --> 39:55.761
She was innocent.

39:55.794 --> 39:57.596
Her son's an orphan now.

39:59.598 --> 40:00.632
Can you live with that?

40:19.184 --> 40:21.587
Well, we had some
awfully good luck today.

40:21.620 --> 40:23.855
I mean, Charlie just
happened to be there

40:23.889 --> 40:26.024
in the exact moment
we saw Gibbs' artwork.

40:26.057 --> 40:27.726
Without Charlie,
we wouldn't have beaten

40:27.759 --> 40:29.595
the gang to the safe house.

40:29.628 --> 40:32.130
Gibbs would be free,
and Frederickson would be dead.

40:32.163 --> 40:34.633
Yeah.
So how did Gibbs

40:34.666 --> 40:36.702
know about Frederickson?

40:36.735 --> 40:38.770
'Cause we had Charlie
to figure it out.

40:38.804 --> 40:40.472
Who the hell did he have?

40:40.506 --> 40:42.741
I'll tell you, he couldn't have
figured it out on his own.

40:45.811 --> 40:46.812
So I think...

40:49.147 --> 40:53.051
...someone told Gibbs
Frederickson set him up.

40:55.153 --> 40:56.154
What do you think, Don?

40:57.723 --> 40:59.124
Well, what are you
asking me, Liz?

40:59.157 --> 41:00.458
What else don't I know?

41:05.797 --> 41:09.968
You didn't tell me about Leah
until she was dead.

41:11.603 --> 41:12.804
Is that how it's going to be?

41:12.838 --> 41:14.205
You're not going
to give me anything

41:14.239 --> 41:15.674
until it blows up on us?

41:16.908 --> 41:18.143
I can't. I cant' do this.

41:18.176 --> 41:21.479
That's what you always say.

41:22.781 --> 41:24.616
So is that it?

41:27.786 --> 41:29.154
Yeah, um, that's, that's it.

41:33.792 --> 41:35.761
Liz... come on.

41:44.603 --> 41:46.638
No wireless Internet
at the monastery?

41:46.672 --> 41:48.707
No wires period.

41:48.740 --> 41:50.942
Since when do you go on eBay?

41:50.976 --> 41:53.078
Oh, it's a brave new world
out there.

41:53.111 --> 41:54.980
I find it oddly exhilarating.

41:55.013 --> 41:58.316
Fifty-five dollars?
For what?

41:58.349 --> 41:59.718
Your book.

41:59.751 --> 42:00.852
What?

42:00.886 --> 42:03.321
Signed Charles Eppes
edition.

42:03.354 --> 42:04.790
Hundred dollar buyout.

42:04.823 --> 42:05.991
No way.

42:06.024 --> 42:07.192
Yeah, there's four days left
to the bidding.

42:07.225 --> 42:08.326
It could go higher.

42:08.359 --> 42:09.795
Well, where
are you headed?

42:09.828 --> 42:11.296
To the bookstore
to get ten more copies.

42:11.329 --> 42:12.598
Get your pen ready.

42:27.879 --> 42:29.815
Thanks.

42:31.149 --> 42:32.751
Let's do it, pal.
