00:01.728 --> 00:03.232
You are being watched.

00:03.953 --> 00:06.060
The government has
a secret system,

00:06.196 --> 00:07.666
a machine

00:07.836 --> 00:10.148
that spies on you
ever hour of every day.

00:10.522 --> 00:13.006
I know, because I built it.

00:13.008 --> 00:15.309
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:15.311 --> 00:17.177
but it sees everything...

00:17.179 --> 00:19.947
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people,

00:19.949 --> 00:21.365
people like you,

00:21.367 --> 00:25.036
crimes the government
considered irrelevant.

00:25.038 --> 00:28.422
They wouldn't act,
so I decided I would.

00:28.424 --> 00:30.274
But I needed a partner--

00:30.276 --> 00:32.993
Someone with the skills
to intervene.

00:32.995 --> 00:37.197
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:37.199 --> 00:39.133
You will never find us.

00:39.135 --> 00:41.135
But victim or perpetrator,

00:41.137 --> 00:44.055
if your number's up,
we'll find you.

Sync and corrections by n17t01

00:53.065 --> 00:55.099
What's wrong
with my other suits?

00:55.101 --> 00:58.319
They're fine
for a hired assassin, Mr. Reese,

00:58.321 --> 01:02.055
just not
for this particular job.

01:02.057 --> 01:03.407
Where am I going?

01:03.409 --> 01:06.059
To mingle
with the best and brightest.

01:06.061 --> 01:10.698
Wall Street.
We have a new number.

01:10.700 --> 01:13.233
Mr. Adam Saunders,
he's a prop trader

01:13.235 --> 01:15.068
at the investment firm
of Baylor Zimm.

01:15.070 --> 01:16.871
- Prop trader?
- Proprietary.

01:16.873 --> 01:19.673
He invests the bank's own money,
not the clients'.

01:19.675 --> 01:22.843
He seems to be
your typical overeducated,

01:22.845 --> 01:25.713
overcompensated
Wall Street highflier.

01:25.715 --> 01:28.415
Hmm.

01:28.417 --> 01:29.400
They're fine.

01:29.402 --> 01:30.751
No.

01:30.753 --> 01:35.556
The cuff should shiver
on the shoe, not break.

01:35.558 --> 01:38.442
Saunders has already had
a brush with the SEC,

01:38.444 --> 01:41.562
an accusation
of insider trading, unproven,

01:41.564 --> 01:44.315
so his risk taking
may have led him

01:44.317 --> 01:45.649
into dangerous waters.

01:45.651 --> 01:48.101
I want you to get close to him.

01:48.103 --> 01:50.204
I don't know anything
about Wall Street.

01:50.206 --> 01:53.908
Well, here's a start, although
it doesn't really matter.

01:53.910 --> 01:57.444
Banking is mostly looking clever
and wearing the right clothes,

01:57.446 --> 02:01.098
and we've managed
the second part.

02:05.253 --> 02:07.838
I don't know how this works,
but he's seen too much.

02:07.840 --> 02:09.840
We'll clean it up.

02:09.842 --> 02:12.426
Whatever it takes.

02:14.000 --> 02:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:22.738 --> 02:24.488
I'm a prop trader,
not a tour guide.

02:24.490 --> 02:27.074
And this guy's a whale.
He brings us business.

02:27.076 --> 02:28.292
It's millions.

02:28.294 --> 02:29.810
And that'd be great,
if I handled clients,

02:29.812 --> 02:31.779
but the only people
I make money for

02:31.781 --> 02:33.146
are Baylor and Zimm.

02:33.148 --> 02:34.815
The amount of bank
this guy's talking,

02:34.817 --> 02:36.917
it'll bleed into ours
soon enough.

02:36.919 --> 02:38.169
Sydney know about this?

02:38.171 --> 02:40.871
Said they requested you
by name.

02:40.873 --> 02:42.790
Someone must think
you know what you're doing.

02:42.792 --> 02:45.676
Look, you're backing me
into a corner on this, Paul.

02:45.678 --> 02:46.794
I've got my eye on a thing.

02:46.796 --> 02:49.463
Hey, what are friends for?

02:49.465 --> 02:51.298
Besides, you don't even
have to meet the whale,

02:51.300 --> 02:54.852
just his rep,
some asset manager.

02:54.854 --> 02:57.371
Outstanding, I'll be spending
two days with hair gel

02:57.373 --> 02:58.606
and a pin-striped suit.

02:58.608 --> 03:01.642
It's Glen check, actually.

03:01.644 --> 03:03.444
John Rooney, Assets.

03:03.446 --> 03:06.647
Adam Saunders.
I know what I'm doing.

03:06.649 --> 03:08.515
My client prefers
to stay anonymous.

03:08.517 --> 03:11.852
He's the...Silent type.

03:11.854 --> 03:15.239
He's also not fond of heights.

03:15.241 --> 03:18.025
I thought rooftops
were your domain, Mr. Reese.

03:18.027 --> 03:19.710
Your reputation precedes you.

03:19.712 --> 03:23.247
My client trusts reputations
when it comes to his money.

03:23.249 --> 03:25.416
Reputations can be deceiving.
How much are we talking about?

03:25.418 --> 03:28.368
At first, pocket change.

03:30.338 --> 03:32.172
My client
likes to roll the dice.

03:32.174 --> 03:35.426
No tips, no I-bonds,
no short-term funds.

03:35.428 --> 03:36.894
Play jazz.

03:36.896 --> 03:40.431
Consider it an audition,
Mr. Saunders.

03:40.433 --> 03:41.732
It starts now.

03:41.734 --> 03:43.717
You're a quick study,
Mr. Reese.

03:43.719 --> 03:44.735
Adam,

03:44.737 --> 03:46.904
get over here, they're reading.

03:46.906 --> 03:48.355
This is Andrea foxglove,

03:48.357 --> 03:50.223
reporting outside
the criminal courthouse

03:50.225 --> 03:51.525
in lower Manhattan.

03:51.527 --> 03:53.694
We've received word
that the jury has returned

03:53.696 --> 03:55.029
in the Robert Keller
murder trial.

03:55.031 --> 03:56.396
You following this,
Robert Keller,

03:56.398 --> 03:58.349
former CEO
of Virtanen PharmaceUticals?

03:58.351 --> 03:59.383
Guy's standing trial
for murder.

03:59.385 --> 04:01.035
I'm familiar with the case.

04:01.037 --> 04:03.337
Only thing between
this company and chapter 11

04:03.339 --> 04:04.237
is an acquittal.

04:04.239 --> 04:07.424
Ever the pessimist, Saunders.

04:07.426 --> 04:09.093
Nothing breeds like bad news.

04:09.095 --> 04:10.911
Even on the broker side.
Right, Vic?

04:10.913 --> 04:13.180
Bad news is already priced in.

04:13.182 --> 04:14.915
Keller's son-in-law's
steering the ship.

04:14.917 --> 04:17.618
It's a blue chip
at a bargain-basement price,

04:17.620 --> 04:20.019
Smart money's already in, pal.

04:20.022 --> 04:22.273
That's why I get to handle
the big bucks around here.

04:22.275 --> 04:24.141
You just went pro too early.

04:24.143 --> 04:25.442
Way too early.

04:25.444 --> 04:27.061
That's Sydney Baylor,
a partner in the firm.

04:27.063 --> 04:30.864
She also has a reputation.

04:30.866 --> 04:32.783
Reputation for what?

04:32.785 --> 04:33.867
Everything.

04:33.869 --> 04:35.903
You held the sell tickets
on Virtanen

04:35.905 --> 04:38.455
to the last minute
so I wouldn't see.

04:38.457 --> 04:40.658
$100 million shorted, Adam?

04:40.660 --> 04:42.409
You said you wanted playmakers
around here.

04:42.411 --> 04:45.379
Wait, you short sold Virtanen?
Are you out of your mind?

04:45.381 --> 04:46.914
It's guilty,
their stock craters,

04:46.916 --> 04:48.716
and I hold the price
that I sold for.

04:48.718 --> 04:51.552
See, that's the smart money,
Victor.

04:51.554 --> 04:56.173
Let...It...Ride.

04:56.175 --> 04:59.560
All right, kid, but consider
what you're betting.

04:59.562 --> 05:00.894
I'm getting word that a verdict

05:00.896 --> 05:01.979
has just been read.

05:01.981 --> 05:04.181
They're relaying it now.

05:04.183 --> 05:05.516
Guilty of all charges.

05:07.653 --> 05:09.236
Immediately following
the verdict,

05:09.238 --> 05:10.554
the DA announced charges

05:10.556 --> 05:15.526
against Virtanen CFO
Mark Lawson.

05:15.528 --> 05:17.411
Congratulations.

05:17.413 --> 05:19.196
You do that again,
and you'll find yourself

05:19.198 --> 05:24.151
the most successful occupier
down in a tent on the street.

05:28.423 --> 05:29.623
Feel like having a drink

05:29.625 --> 05:31.625
over the grave of
Virtanen PharmaceUticals?

05:31.627 --> 05:33.377
Why not?

05:33.379 --> 05:34.511
I'll round up some guys.

05:34.513 --> 05:38.165
Meet you downstairs
after the closing bell.

05:47.559 --> 05:49.476
His phone didn't pair, Finch.

05:49.478 --> 05:52.146
That ever happen before?

05:52.148 --> 05:53.513
All I can think
is that somebody else

05:53.515 --> 05:54.948
already blue-jacked him.

05:54.950 --> 05:59.453
It appears we're not the only
ones looking into Adam Saunders.

05:59.455 --> 06:01.622
I see why.

06:01.624 --> 06:04.041
Guy plays poker
with other people's money

06:04.043 --> 06:07.411
and gloats about it.

06:07.413 --> 06:09.213
I wouldn't be so sure
about that.

06:09.215 --> 06:12.666
Someone like that,
the win doesn't concern him.

06:12.668 --> 06:15.803
It's the rush.

06:37.525 --> 06:40.411
Virtanen.

06:40.413 --> 06:44.031
Two vultures, one stone.
How did you know?

06:44.033 --> 06:46.233
I read everything,

06:46.235 --> 06:48.419
all the 10K financials
nobody else bothered to.

06:48.421 --> 06:50.254
Virtanen didn't have
any blockbuster drugs

06:50.256 --> 06:51.404
in the pipeline.

06:51.406 --> 06:52.873
They'd hocked everything
but the family cow

06:52.875 --> 06:55.292
for Keller's legal defense,
not to mention the CFO's.

06:55.294 --> 06:57.795
It was all buried,
but I found it,

06:57.797 --> 06:59.797
and Keller was just
the tip of the iceberg.

06:59.799 --> 07:05.352
That ship was going down,
so I took the bet.

07:05.354 --> 07:08.639
No risk, no reward.

07:08.641 --> 07:11.191
You ever play Russian roulette?

07:11.193 --> 07:16.320
You want to get in the game,
you got to spin the cylinder.

07:21.449 --> 07:23.882
♪ ♪

07:28.371 --> 07:32.624
You in his apartment yet,
Finch?

07:32.626 --> 07:35.327
The rent on this place
must be a staggering.

07:35.329 --> 07:38.730
Maybe that's why
he doesn't have any furniture.

07:47.390 --> 07:50.008
Mr. Reese, there's
a small fortune

07:50.010 --> 07:53.479
in Saunders' closet.

07:53.481 --> 07:56.515
Whenever you're ready.

07:56.517 --> 08:00.468
For a banker,
he doesn't seem to trust banks.

08:00.470 --> 08:03.739
Bundles of $200 each.

08:09.279 --> 08:11.780
And another club soda.

08:11.782 --> 08:14.199
You pay, but you don't drink.

08:14.201 --> 08:17.319
I drink, just not right now.

08:17.321 --> 08:21.423
Adam here prefers to keep
his wits about him at all times.

08:21.425 --> 08:22.758
I hate that.

08:22.760 --> 08:24.259
How was the dime tour?

08:24.261 --> 08:25.878
Was our proprietary friend here

08:25.880 --> 08:27.462
worth the reputation?

08:27.464 --> 08:28.547
Every penny.

08:28.549 --> 08:31.833
There he is,
Mr. Big Shot.

08:31.835 --> 08:35.187
You know how many clients
I had to apologize to today

08:35.188 --> 08:38.357
when they found out I put them
in a stock you shorted?

08:38.359 --> 08:40.058
Okay.

08:40.059 --> 08:42.361
Next time, do your homework.

08:42.363 --> 08:43.562
Homework?

08:43.563 --> 08:45.063
What are we, in grade school?

08:45.065 --> 08:46.565
Oh, sorry, Vic.

08:46.567 --> 08:50.135
I guess you just went pro
too early.

08:54.124 --> 08:56.291
- Hey!
- Watch it! Come on!

08:56.293 --> 08:57.993
Oh, my God!

08:57.995 --> 08:59.027
Let's go.

08:59.029 --> 09:00.329
Hey!
Watch it!

09:00.331 --> 09:01.380
My suit!

09:03.250 --> 09:05.884
Hey, Finch, we've got
a Wall Street trader

09:05.886 --> 09:09.171
that gambles millions by day,
fights in bars at night,

09:09.173 --> 09:12.391
And someone's tracking him.

09:12.393 --> 09:14.042
Stay on him tonight.

09:14.044 --> 09:16.812
If somebody goes after him,
it'll likely happen at his home.

09:16.814 --> 09:21.433
Yeah, problem is,
he isn't going home.

09:21.435 --> 09:24.836
Looks like
he's working overtime.

09:26.889 --> 09:31.360
Adam is closer to his boss
than we thought, Finch.

09:31.362 --> 09:33.561
Who is this guy?

09:48.128 --> 09:49.812
Adam never came home
last night.

09:49.814 --> 09:51.397
Since it was there,
I took the liberty

09:51.399 --> 09:51.808
of copying
some of his personal records.

09:51.810 --> 09:53.460
I filled in some of the gaps,
not all.

09:53.462 --> 09:55.479
I do have a death certificate
for Saunders' mother

09:55.481 --> 09:57.314
from when he was nine.

09:57.316 --> 10:00.400
Guardianship papers
signed by a Robert Sowoski

10:00.402 --> 10:01.852
from three years later.

10:01.854 --> 10:03.470
No father in the picture?

10:03.472 --> 10:04.604
I guess not.

10:04.606 --> 10:07.657
I pulled up his
employment contract

10:07.659 --> 10:09.576
from his personal computer.

10:09.578 --> 10:13.663
Sydney Baylor hired him
herself.

10:13.665 --> 10:16.316
Their private relationship
may account for

10:16.318 --> 10:18.702
his speedy rise
to a trading desk.

10:18.704 --> 10:19.870
This looks like a little more

10:19.872 --> 10:22.589
than sleeping your way
to the top, Finch.

10:22.591 --> 10:25.625
No other smudges on his record,

10:25.627 --> 10:27.794
except for a securities and
exchange commission

10:27.796 --> 10:31.014
investigation that involved him
six months ago.

10:31.016 --> 10:31.998
I don't know why.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.134
Maybe Detective Carter
could help.

10:34.136 --> 10:35.102
We'll see.

10:35.104 --> 10:37.020
Until then, I've taken care of

10:37.022 --> 10:40.607
the current surveillance
on Adam.

10:40.609 --> 10:44.194
After a GPRS reroute, no one
will be listening to his calls.

10:44.196 --> 10:46.012
If someone makes another attempt
on his phone,

10:46.014 --> 10:47.030
they'll have to get close.

10:47.032 --> 10:50.200
And we'll nail them.

10:50.202 --> 10:53.320
- Joss Carter?
- Yeah.

10:53.322 --> 10:55.238
I have your delivery here
from Westside Dry Cleaning.

10:55.240 --> 10:57.023
I didn't have any dry cleaning.

10:57.025 --> 10:59.209
Well, got your name on it
here, so--

10:59.211 --> 11:00.210
What is it?

11:00.212 --> 11:03.747
One man's suit.

11:03.749 --> 11:07.918
Just sign right here.

11:07.920 --> 11:11.088
Thank you.

11:20.348 --> 11:22.265
3 World Financial Center,
please.

11:22.267 --> 11:25.719
John's gonna want
that suit back.

11:30.943 --> 11:33.660
So where's Mr. Navaad?

11:33.662 --> 11:35.529
He's taking his family
to a Knicks game

11:35.531 --> 11:39.399
while I borrow his taxi.

11:39.401 --> 11:41.168
Adam Saunders?
Is he in trouble?

11:41.170 --> 11:42.452
He might be.

11:42.454 --> 11:45.122
He needs our help, Detective
Carter, and I need yours.

11:45.124 --> 11:47.374
Is that why we're going to
3 World Financial Center?

11:47.376 --> 11:48.575
No, that's the regional offices

11:48.577 --> 11:50.243
of the securities
and exchange commission.

11:50.245 --> 11:53.079
We need to get a look at
sealed SEC records

11:53.081 --> 11:54.264
pertaining to Mr. Saunders.

11:56.518 --> 11:59.970
And you think
I can just do that?

11:59.972 --> 12:02.022
If anyone can do it, you can.

12:02.024 --> 12:03.640
All right.

12:03.642 --> 12:06.810
I'll see what I can do.

12:09.113 --> 12:10.313
You turned on the meter?

12:10.315 --> 12:13.533
Don't forget to tip.

12:19.974 --> 12:22.159
- Triple espresso, please.
- No problem.

12:22.161 --> 12:24.127
Oh, triple espresso?

12:24.129 --> 12:26.046
That's a lot of caffeine.
You must be tired.

12:26.048 --> 12:28.798
I am tired
of nosy SEC investigators.

12:28.800 --> 12:31.418
Your inquiry wrapped
six months ago.

12:31.420 --> 12:33.453
And I can't let another
Ivy League punk like yourself

12:33.455 --> 12:35.755
get away with it.

12:35.757 --> 12:38.225
And I still have
nothing to say.

12:38.227 --> 12:40.460
You're always very good
at keeping your mouth shut.

12:40.462 --> 12:42.929
You know what?
Hey, I'm so sorry, forget it.

12:45.601 --> 12:47.601
Is this-- Is this
the new standard procedure?

12:47.603 --> 12:49.186
Harassment in broad daylight?

12:49.188 --> 12:51.021
A year from now,
I'm still gonna be looking.

12:51.023 --> 12:54.074
One slip, so much as
give your grandma a stock tip,

12:54.076 --> 12:55.108
I'm gonna get you, kid.

12:55.110 --> 12:59.029
The SEC is a watchdog
without teeth.

12:59.031 --> 13:00.480
You couldn't give
a parking ticket.

13:00.482 --> 13:02.449
Good thing I got friends
in the justice department.

13:02.451 --> 13:07.204
They love sending rich
white boys up to Otisville.

13:07.206 --> 13:10.823
Watch your step.

13:12.793 --> 13:16.880
Carter sent over
the sealed SEC files.

13:16.882 --> 13:20.984
Inspector Doug Rasmussen
pursued possible counts

13:20.986 --> 13:24.170
of insider trading
at Baylor Zimm last year.

13:24.172 --> 13:27.224
The inquiry was aimed
at top tier executives.

13:27.226 --> 13:30.860
Adam was a subpoenaed witness,
but all charges were dropped.

13:30.862 --> 13:33.980
He testified to knowing of
zero wrongdoing

13:33.982 --> 13:35.949
among the upper management
of the firm.

13:35.951 --> 13:39.519
I believe he was lying to
protect his boss, Sydney Baylor.

13:43.007 --> 13:44.708
What's Adam up to now?

13:44.710 --> 13:46.676
Headed all the way
out to Queens.

13:46.678 --> 13:48.378
Looks like he's got
a bone to pick

13:48.380 --> 13:50.764
with a guy in a food truck.

13:50.766 --> 13:52.132
Hey, buddy.

13:52.134 --> 13:54.985
I had a bratwurst from
this rolling outhouse last week,

13:54.987 --> 13:56.386
hit me worse
than a master cleanse.

13:56.388 --> 13:57.870
I'm calling
the department of health, okay?

13:57.872 --> 13:59.339
You know,
I don't see what the problem is,

13:59.341 --> 14:01.424
'cause now you can
stuff that soft gut of yours

14:01.426 --> 14:03.426
back into your $2,000 suit.

14:03.428 --> 14:04.978
$3,000 suit.

14:04.980 --> 14:08.164
$3,000? For a suit?

14:08.166 --> 14:10.850
$3,000 for a suit.
How are you, pal?

14:10.852 --> 14:12.018
Good.

14:12.020 --> 14:15.438
The food truck is registered
to Robert Sowoski.

14:15.440 --> 14:16.606
The legal guardian?

14:16.608 --> 14:17.691
What, you don't come around

14:17.693 --> 14:18.742
the old neighborhood anymore?

14:18.744 --> 14:20.543
Life in the fast lane,
Uncle Bob.

14:20.545 --> 14:21.995
Come on in.
I'll get you something to eat.

14:21.997 --> 14:23.530
He's more than a guardian,

14:23.532 --> 14:25.999
he's also a Baylor Zimm client.

14:26.001 --> 14:27.751
Hey. Did you look into
that MNP I asked about?

14:27.753 --> 14:31.921
MLP, Uncle Bob.
"Master Limited Partnership."

14:31.923 --> 14:33.506
And it's called Tritak Energy.

14:33.508 --> 14:35.408
Tritak, right.
Right.

14:35.410 --> 14:37.294
Look, I know you told
those fancy number crunchers

14:37.296 --> 14:39.546
over at your office
to take care of my money,

14:39.548 --> 14:42.415
but I'm reading all this
material they keep sending me.

14:42.417 --> 14:45.101
It looks like an awful lot
of cash going into one company.

14:45.103 --> 14:48.772
I mean, I keep seeing it.
"Tritak. Tritak."

14:48.774 --> 14:50.757
I mean, it was 10%,
now it's 40.

14:50.759 --> 14:52.759
Even a financial dunce
like myself knows

14:52.761 --> 14:53.926
you got to diversify, right?

14:53.928 --> 14:56.196
Uncle Bob,
would I steer you wrong?

14:56.198 --> 14:57.981
Who got you those tax breaks?

14:57.983 --> 14:59.232
Who got you
that low-interest loan?

14:59.234 --> 15:01.434
- You had one truck, now--
- Now I got six trucks.

15:01.436 --> 15:02.652
20 employees.

15:02.654 --> 15:04.937
And from what I heard,
that MLP is returning 8%.

15:04.939 --> 15:06.072
Where else are you gonna find
that kind of return

15:06.074 --> 15:07.407
on your money?

15:07.409 --> 15:09.108
Trust that broker
that I set you up with.

15:09.110 --> 15:10.827
- Adam...I do.
- What?

15:10.829 --> 15:13.296
You're a genius,
and you always have been.

15:13.298 --> 15:14.664
Thank you.

15:14.666 --> 15:17.116
What do we know about
Tritak Energy, Finch?

15:17.118 --> 15:19.135
Not much.
Stay close to Adam.

15:19.137 --> 15:20.453
See what you can find out.

15:20.455 --> 15:24.758
On a side note, Saunders
guided me to a very kind broker

15:24.760 --> 15:28.194
who happily deposited our money
in Baylor Zimm.

15:28.196 --> 15:30.563
Hope you got a receipt, Finch.

15:37.021 --> 15:38.588
Mr. Saunders,

15:38.590 --> 15:40.990
we had an appointment
to finalize that deposit.

15:40.992 --> 15:43.093
Uh, give me--
Give me one minute.

15:43.095 --> 15:47.146
Hey, Paul?

15:47.148 --> 15:48.481
Paul, you got a sec?

15:48.483 --> 15:49.783
Yeah.

15:49.785 --> 15:51.084
That company--
That energy company

15:51.086 --> 15:53.620
I asked you about last week, Tritak?

15:53.622 --> 15:55.372
You made $100 million yesterday

15:55.374 --> 15:56.656
in the short of the century

15:56.658 --> 16:00.043
and you're asking about
some MLP?

16:00.045 --> 16:02.512
- Who cares?
- It's my uncle's cash. I care.

16:02.514 --> 16:05.215
- All the fixed-income crowd
is getting dumped into MLPs.

16:05.217 --> 16:06.850
It's safe, boring.

16:06.852 --> 16:09.102
It's not just my uncle, it's
half the clients at this firm,

16:09.104 --> 16:10.186
and it's half the firm.

16:10.188 --> 16:11.471
I ran the numbers last week.

16:11.473 --> 16:14.674
Baylor Zimm is invested
in this thing to 19%.

16:14.676 --> 16:17.694
Anybody even tracking that?

16:17.696 --> 16:19.279
You've been
looking into client money?

16:19.281 --> 16:21.064
You know you can't do that,
right?

16:21.066 --> 16:23.650
Like, federally you can't.

16:23.652 --> 16:28.187
It's illegal...
And so is this conversation.

16:28.189 --> 16:29.289
Thanks for the tip.

16:29.291 --> 16:32.792
Hey, what are friends for?

16:32.794 --> 16:36.913
- We'll talk later.
- Yeah.

16:36.915 --> 16:38.131
What's this I hear about

16:38.133 --> 16:40.800
you getting questioned
by the SEC today?

16:40.802 --> 16:42.419
It's nothing.
It's the same guy, Rasmussen.

16:42.421 --> 16:44.704
New day, same song.
He's got nothing.

16:44.706 --> 16:45.922
But I need to talk to you.

16:45.924 --> 16:47.590
You remember that company
I asked you about

16:47.592 --> 16:49.893
the other night, Tritak?

16:49.895 --> 16:53.379
How about we keep what we
talk about at night, at night?

16:53.381 --> 16:56.099
And as for the SEC,
just remember the last time

16:56.101 --> 16:58.067
we barely got off the hook.

16:58.069 --> 17:00.270
We can't take
another embarrassment.

17:00.272 --> 17:04.056
You mean the firm can't take
another embarrassment, right?

17:04.058 --> 17:08.077
Keep your head down, Adam.
Please.

17:18.923 --> 17:21.124
I come here a lot
when I need to decompress.

17:21.126 --> 17:22.375
It's peaceful.

17:22.377 --> 17:24.911
So what were you arguing about
at the office today?

17:24.913 --> 17:26.128
That isn't anything
that your client

17:26.131 --> 17:28.181
needs to worry about.

17:28.183 --> 17:30.016
Is the SEC something my client

17:30.018 --> 17:32.585
needs to be worried about?

17:32.587 --> 17:35.805
In this business,
someone's always trying to find

17:35.807 --> 17:37.640
the trick, the con.

17:37.642 --> 17:40.059
Right.
So what's yours?

17:40.061 --> 17:42.762
We're just that good.

17:42.764 --> 17:45.148
Uh-huh.

17:45.150 --> 17:47.266
Is that why you invested
your uncle's money

17:47.268 --> 17:51.488
with the firm?

17:51.490 --> 17:52.455
Excuse me?

17:52.457 --> 17:56.142
We have $150 million
on the line.

17:56.144 --> 17:59.712
We'd like to know
everything, Adam.

17:59.714 --> 18:03.216
"Saunders" is
your given name, right?

18:03.218 --> 18:05.585
But wouldn't "Sowoski"
be more accurate?

18:05.587 --> 18:08.888
Are you having me followed?

18:08.890 --> 18:09.956
All right, let's go.

18:09.958 --> 18:10.957
I'm driving you back to BZ,

18:10.959 --> 18:12.308
and if they still
want your money,

18:12.310 --> 18:16.596
some other schmuck
can handle it.

18:18.933 --> 18:20.016
So we're clear,

18:20.018 --> 18:22.485
my family, my past
is none of your business,

18:22.487 --> 18:24.521
no matter how much money
is at stake.

18:24.523 --> 18:25.805
Right.

18:25.807 --> 18:28.107
You know, maybe I should
call the police.

18:28.109 --> 18:30.476
- You may need to.
- What are you talking about?

18:30.478 --> 18:32.311
You see the construction
equipment back there?

18:32.313 --> 18:33.279
Yeah, I see it.
So what?

18:33.281 --> 18:35.314
You see any workers with it?

18:35.316 --> 18:37.750
What do you mean?
They want me to slow down.

18:37.752 --> 18:39.586
We're being funneled.
Don't stop!

18:56.670 --> 18:58.848
Someone just tried
to kill Adam, Finch.

19:07.789 --> 19:09.573
How's Mr. Saunders
after last night?

19:09.575 --> 19:11.124
He thinks it was an accident.

19:11.126 --> 19:12.459
And you're sure it wasn't?

19:12.461 --> 19:14.094
It's called
"funneling."

19:14.096 --> 19:15.879
You force your target
into a kill zone

19:15.881 --> 19:18.065
by subtly shifting
his direction.

19:18.067 --> 19:19.766
Carter's looking
at the scene now.

19:19.768 --> 19:22.302
The vehicles, the stop light.

19:22.304 --> 19:23.770
It was professional,

19:23.772 --> 19:27.524
but who wants Adam dead enough
to bring in a hit team?

19:29.568 --> 19:31.488
I've been watching my money.

19:31.490 --> 19:32.544
The majority of it is being
shuffled into one company--

19:32.546 --> 19:34.496
Tritak, same one
that Adam's uncle mentioned--

19:34.498 --> 19:37.816
Only at ten times the rate
that his money was invested.

19:37.818 --> 19:40.619
Someone is moving faster
than before.

19:40.621 --> 19:43.255
Tritak invests in
the Louisiana/Texas pipeline

19:43.257 --> 19:45.123
running gas to the northeast.

19:45.125 --> 19:46.892
People need natural gas,

19:46.894 --> 19:50.629
so for the most part, Tritak
should keep a steady price,

19:50.631 --> 19:53.565
but it shot up 600% recently

19:53.567 --> 19:57.235
because of a buy frenzy
initiated at Baylor Zimm.

19:57.237 --> 19:59.404
- Insider trading?
- Happened before.

19:59.406 --> 20:01.773
Adam knew about it then,
maybe he knows about it now.

20:01.775 --> 20:04.743
Except he won't walk away
this time.

20:06.979 --> 20:09.498
We were almost roadkill
last night.

20:09.500 --> 20:12.334
I'm getting tired of
playing around.

20:12.336 --> 20:14.836
Mr. Sowoski,
I'm with the SEC.

20:14.838 --> 20:18.040
We're looking into
possible criminal activities

20:18.042 --> 20:21.176
at Baylor Zimm Investments.

20:21.178 --> 20:23.295
We know your nephew
is a trader there.

20:23.297 --> 20:24.496
What?
Did he do something wrong?

20:24.498 --> 20:27.132
We can't be sure.

20:27.134 --> 20:29.635
Does Adam advise you
on your own investments?

20:29.637 --> 20:32.771
No, I got a broker for that.

20:32.773 --> 20:35.507
What can you tell me about...

20:35.509 --> 20:40.345
A company called Tritak Energy?

20:40.347 --> 20:43.014
Not much.
You'd have to talk to my guy.

20:43.016 --> 20:46.284
But your own money is
heavily invested in it, correct?

20:50.740 --> 20:52.658
Yeah.

20:52.660 --> 20:55.360
You know, I knew there was
something fishy going on there,

20:55.362 --> 20:58.296
but Adam,
he put me with good people.

20:58.298 --> 20:59.348
He said it was fine.

20:59.350 --> 21:03.885
How well
do you know your nephew?

21:03.887 --> 21:06.054
When my sister died,

21:06.056 --> 21:08.557
Adam's dad left
to find work out west.

21:08.559 --> 21:11.543
He ended up in New Mexico.
He never came back.

21:11.545 --> 21:14.930
So Adam lived with my family.

21:14.932 --> 21:18.333
Every month,
his father sent $200 home,

21:18.335 --> 21:21.570
for whatever, comic books,
new shoes.

21:21.572 --> 21:23.605
Adam never spent it.

21:23.607 --> 21:30.612
Year after year, he saved
every penny in shoe boxes.

21:30.614 --> 21:31.947
It was thousands.

21:31.949 --> 21:36.752
And when he grew up, he used it
to enroll in night classes

21:36.754 --> 21:40.672
before he could get into
a real business school.

21:40.674 --> 21:43.425
And in the end,

21:43.427 --> 21:47.546
what Adam had
instead of a father was...

21:47.548 --> 21:50.432
Cash in a shoe box.

21:50.434 --> 21:54.970
And what did he do?
He bought himself a future.

21:57.056 --> 22:00.358
Saunders, we should talk, now.

22:00.360 --> 22:04.112
Tritak.

22:05.732 --> 22:07.949
A run-of-the-mill MLP
just happens to be

22:07.951 --> 22:11.102
the hottest damn equity
on the market these days.

22:11.104 --> 22:13.121
You tell me what you know.

22:13.123 --> 22:14.239
I don't know anything.

22:14.241 --> 22:15.624
Oh, I'll bet
you'll start remembering

22:15.626 --> 22:17.409
when you're up in Otisville.

22:17.411 --> 22:19.995
But by then, it'll be
too late to make a deal.

22:19.997 --> 22:21.946
Okay.
Okay.

22:21.948 --> 22:25.834
All right, look.
Look.

22:25.836 --> 22:28.136
I ran some numbers
the other night.

22:28.138 --> 22:29.838
It looks like--
It doesn't add up.

22:29.840 --> 22:31.289
There's no reason why

22:31.291 --> 22:33.391
Baylor Zimm should be
dumping so much money

22:33.393 --> 22:35.293
into this one company.

22:35.295 --> 22:36.595
Unless--

22:36.597 --> 22:40.599
Unless somebody knows something
the rest of us don't.

22:40.601 --> 22:43.134
You still have the numbers
you ran?

22:43.136 --> 22:44.986
On a laptop, in my office.

22:38.776 --> 22:41.182
Get it.

22:47.392 --> 22:51.488
Now.

23:21.854 --> 23:24.387
Excuse me.

23:41.706 --> 23:43.790
Mr. Reese,
we have a problem.

23:43.792 --> 23:46.993
He's on the roof.

24:07.448 --> 24:11.268
We got to get you out of here.
Come on.

24:11.270 --> 24:12.319
We have to move fast.

24:12.321 --> 24:13.904
This building
is tactically unsafe.

24:13.906 --> 24:15.555
You're not an asset manager.

24:15.557 --> 24:19.993
No, but I did save your life.

24:19.995 --> 24:21.728
What the hell happened
back there?

24:21.730 --> 24:24.230
Just a second attempt
to kill you.

24:24.232 --> 24:26.416
I need to know
what about Tritak

24:26.418 --> 24:28.251
has people repeatedly trying
to do that.

24:28.253 --> 24:30.420
I-- It started
with my uncle.

24:30.422 --> 24:32.005
The firm invested him
in a company.

24:32.007 --> 24:33.957
He asked me some questions,
so I took a peek.

24:33.959 --> 24:35.408
Illegally?

24:35.410 --> 24:37.844
Yeah, but he was family.
I didn't think anything of it.

24:37.846 --> 24:40.246
And then I saw some numbers
that I didn't agree with,

24:40.248 --> 24:42.382
so I wrote an email.
I was going to send it

24:42.384 --> 24:45.051
to risk management, legal,
the partners, everybody,

24:45.053 --> 24:47.771
but then-- then the SEC
started sneaking around,

24:47.773 --> 24:48.805
so I was told
to keep my mouth shut.

24:48.807 --> 24:50.590
You think it was
insider trading?

24:50.592 --> 24:51.758
It wouldn't be the first time,

24:51.760 --> 24:54.260
but look,
I never sent that email.

24:54.262 --> 24:56.396
Did you tell anyone else?

24:56.398 --> 24:57.647
A few friends at the firm.

24:57.649 --> 24:58.982
I-- I asked them
just to take a look at it, and--

24:58.984 --> 25:01.701
Come on.

25:01.703 --> 25:04.404
Who?

25:04.406 --> 25:08.792
Sydney Baylor.

25:12.079 --> 25:14.497
I got the search results
that you wanted, Carter.

25:14.499 --> 25:19.118
Only one utility yard reports
vehicle thefts in the last week.

25:19.120 --> 25:21.721
All stolen three nights ago.

25:21.723 --> 25:23.673
Back hoe, steam roller,

25:23.675 --> 25:27.093
and a refurbished
sanitation vehicle?

25:27.095 --> 25:31.297
What would somebody want
with an old garbage truck?

25:31.299 --> 25:34.484
Thanks.

25:36.020 --> 25:38.288
Mr. Reese,
did you find Sydney Baylor?

25:38.290 --> 25:41.408
Yeah,
we're at her penthouse now,

25:41.410 --> 25:42.943
but she isn't saying much.

25:42.945 --> 25:44.995
Whoever is after Adam
got to her first.

25:44.997 --> 25:46.079
This is my fault.

25:46.081 --> 25:49.315
I asked her about
the Tritak numbers.

25:49.317 --> 25:52.369
She must have
looked into them herself.

25:52.371 --> 25:57.674
Oh-- oh, my God.
They killed her.

25:57.676 --> 26:01.011
Adam,
you recognize that bottle?

26:01.013 --> 26:02.262
Yeah, we drank it
the other night

26:02.264 --> 26:05.248
to celebrate
the Virtanen short.

26:05.250 --> 26:07.851
Which means your fingerprints
are all over it.

26:07.853 --> 26:10.387
Everywhere.

26:10.389 --> 26:14.024
Finch, they killed Baylor for
digging into her own company.

26:14.026 --> 26:15.358
Made it look like Adam did it

26:15.360 --> 26:17.110
before plunging
to his own death.

26:18.780 --> 26:20.513
The cavalry's here.
Time to go.

26:20.515 --> 26:22.015
The police
will be all over Adam.

26:22.017 --> 26:23.116
What are you going to do
with him?

26:23.118 --> 26:27.620
I'll take him somewhere safe.
Come on.

26:38.048 --> 26:40.633
Cause of death was
blunt force trauma to the head.

26:40.635 --> 26:42.951
- Prints?
- I dusted twice.

26:42.953 --> 26:44.753
None on the tub,
none on the body.

26:44.755 --> 26:47.890
Only other ones we found were
the vic's and an Adam Saunders.

26:47.892 --> 26:50.292
We think he was having
a relationship with the victim.

26:50.294 --> 26:53.012
His prints are all over the home
and murder weapon.

26:53.014 --> 26:56.148
You mean the champagne bottle?

26:56.150 --> 26:58.517
How'd you know that?

26:58.519 --> 26:59.985
Here.

26:59.987 --> 27:02.988
Thanks.

27:02.990 --> 27:07.109
Is there any chance, if Saunders
was having a relationship

27:07.111 --> 27:09.811
with the vic, that he could have
handled the champagne bottle,

27:09.813 --> 27:13.032
say, days ago,
then had it planted?

27:13.034 --> 27:15.284
That'd be pretty slick.

27:15.286 --> 27:16.669
But who'd
go through the trouble?

27:16.671 --> 27:19.421
You'd have to, what,
search the building's garbage?

27:19.423 --> 27:21.457
Anyway, basement's guarded.

27:21.459 --> 27:25.444
Unless they had a garbage truck.

27:26.546 --> 27:28.631
Mr. Reese, we have many
safe houses in the city

27:28.633 --> 27:29.932
where Adam could be taken.

27:29.934 --> 27:33.519
I know.

27:40.644 --> 27:44.063
The safest I've ever been
was when I was anonymous.

27:44.065 --> 27:46.348
Here.
You'll be safe, too.

27:46.350 --> 27:48.400
Wait, you can't leave me here.

27:48.402 --> 27:50.452
I can't sleep here.

27:50.454 --> 27:53.021
Why not?
I did.

27:53.023 --> 27:55.241
Right over there,
for four months.

27:55.243 --> 27:58.661
See that woman?
Her name is Joan.

27:58.663 --> 28:00.996
If you need anything,
just ask her.

28:00.998 --> 28:06.034
Oh, uh, just don't
touch anything in her cart.

28:06.036 --> 28:08.637
Here.

28:08.639 --> 28:12.007
Don't use this phone
until I call you on it.

28:12.009 --> 28:14.009
Wait, wait, wait.

28:14.011 --> 28:15.644
Victor, go find Victor.

28:15.646 --> 28:17.730
Your pal from the nightclub?

28:17.732 --> 28:19.481
He's the senior broker.

28:19.483 --> 28:21.267
If someone's putting clients
in Tritak,

28:21.269 --> 28:22.818
whether or not they want it,

28:22.820 --> 28:25.287
he's the next rung down
on the brokerage ladder.

28:30.193 --> 28:32.411
If this bill
had not been passed today,

28:32.413 --> 28:34.730
it would have been put aside
indefinitely,

28:34.732 --> 28:36.498
which we feel
would be detrimental

28:36.500 --> 28:39.084
to the State of New York.

28:39.086 --> 28:41.754
We have a problem,
Mr. Reese.

28:41.756 --> 28:44.072
What else is new?

28:44.074 --> 28:45.624
Have you heard
about Utica Shale

28:45.626 --> 28:47.409
or the process of fracking?

28:47.411 --> 28:50.396
It's, um,
underground rock formations.

28:50.398 --> 28:52.748
Companies dig down
and fracture shale beds

28:52.750 --> 28:54.516
to release natural gas.

28:54.518 --> 28:56.852
They just passed a bill
to start fracking

28:56.854 --> 28:58.437
in upstate New York,

28:58.439 --> 29:02.942
which means they wouldn't need
a pipeline up from the South.

29:02.944 --> 29:06.412
And they don't need to invest
in a company like Tritak.

29:06.414 --> 29:09.064
How much did Baylor Zimm
have invested in Tritak?

29:09.066 --> 29:11.116
Or how much did its clients?

29:11.118 --> 29:14.286
Millions.

29:14.288 --> 29:17.072
Millions upon millions,

29:17.074 --> 29:20.626
and they will lose everything.

29:20.628 --> 29:22.962
Adam saw this coming,
tried to stop it.

29:22.964 --> 29:25.113
Which is why
they tried to kill him.

29:25.115 --> 29:28.167
But who are they?

29:28.169 --> 29:31.453
Adam told me to talk to Victor.

29:31.455 --> 29:36.492
Said he would have to know.

29:41.682 --> 29:43.465
The bill passed overnight.

29:43.467 --> 29:47.686
I'm trying to sell your shares
as fast as I can.

29:47.688 --> 29:50.272
You have to understand--

29:50.274 --> 29:52.358
Hello, Victor.

29:52.360 --> 29:55.077
You're a patsy.

29:55.079 --> 29:57.079
They just used you,

29:57.081 --> 30:01.367
but your boss is dead,
Adam's life is on the line,

30:01.369 --> 30:04.036
and millions were lost.

30:04.038 --> 30:07.339
People needed that money.
Families.

30:07.341 --> 30:11.377
I thought Tritak
was a safe bet.

30:11.379 --> 30:13.796
Someone got to the senators,

30:13.798 --> 30:15.514
someone powerful enough

30:15.516 --> 30:18.133
to push that shale fracking bill
through the system.

30:18.135 --> 30:21.270
But why build Tritak up?

30:21.272 --> 30:24.857
Why silence Adam...

30:24.859 --> 30:29.395
Only to watch it fail?

30:39.739 --> 30:42.241
Oh, no.

30:45.079 --> 30:47.146
Listen, it's a short sale.

30:47.148 --> 30:49.798
Someone had the brokers
pump up the price

30:49.800 --> 30:51.533
and then sold high,
because they knew

30:51.535 --> 30:54.136
that the bill was gonna pass
and kill Tritak.

30:54.138 --> 30:56.705
Whoever shorted it
stands to make millions on this.

30:56.707 --> 30:58.924
That's why they targeted you.

30:58.926 --> 31:00.759
So how do we find
the short-seller?

31:00.761 --> 31:03.062
Look around you-- There's
50 brokers selling off Tritak.

31:03.064 --> 31:05.547
We need to find the guys
who already sold it days ago,

31:05.549 --> 31:09.685
because now they have to cover
the short and buy it back.

31:09.687 --> 31:12.371
I got to go.

31:14.441 --> 31:15.741
Hey, uncle Bob.

31:15.743 --> 31:19.528
Adam, what's going on?
You told me Tritak was safe.

31:19.530 --> 31:22.564
Bob, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'll get your money back.

31:22.566 --> 31:24.366
It's not just my money, Adam.

31:24.368 --> 31:26.618
It-- It's salaries.
It's pensions.

31:26.620 --> 31:28.737
It's every employee
that works for me.

31:28.739 --> 31:31.173
It's my business,
the Sowoski name.

31:31.175 --> 31:32.240
Bob, I-I--
Look--

31:32.242 --> 31:33.759
But you're not a Sowoski,

31:33.761 --> 31:36.211
at least you never thought
you were.

31:36.213 --> 31:39.131
You're a Saunders.

31:39.133 --> 31:40.265
Isn't that right, Adam?

31:40.267 --> 31:42.584
No, listen--
Listen, I'll get it back.

31:42.586 --> 31:45.020
Even if it takes
the rest of my life,

31:45.022 --> 31:46.221
I will get it back.

31:46.223 --> 31:48.857
I got to go.

31:50.760 --> 31:52.060
Hey, boss?

31:52.062 --> 31:55.347
I think I got a location
on the kid.

31:56.399 --> 31:58.350
I'm going to need your help
on this, Finch.

31:58.352 --> 32:01.153
I need you
to get inside Baylor Zimm.

32:01.155 --> 32:04.272
I'm on the trading floor now.

32:24.561 --> 32:27.062
Mr. Reese,
I found something.

32:28.965 --> 32:30.799
Paul Ashton.

32:32.352 --> 32:34.353
Adam's friend.

32:34.355 --> 32:38.106
Also a senior risk manager.

32:38.108 --> 32:40.859
I found his short-sale orders
from last week,

32:40.861 --> 32:43.645
and the buy orders for Tritak,
issued to him this morning.

32:43.647 --> 32:44.947
For how many?

32:44.949 --> 32:46.448
About $4 million.

32:46.450 --> 32:50.369
Where is Paul now?

32:50.371 --> 32:51.653
I'm about to find out.

32:51.655 --> 32:53.789
His phone is tethered
to his calendar.

32:53.791 --> 32:56.592
Maybe I can hack into his GPS.

32:56.594 --> 32:57.843
Paul?

32:57.845 --> 32:59.494
It can't be.

32:59.496 --> 33:01.263
No, I-I mean, really,
it can't.

33:01.265 --> 33:03.515
They put measures in place
to catch securities fraud,

33:03.517 --> 33:07.519
insider trading,
short-sale manipulation,

33:07.521 --> 33:09.838
how did Paul do it?

33:09.840 --> 33:11.840
Paul isn't working alone.

33:11.842 --> 33:14.309
He's got a friend in the SEC.

33:19.566 --> 33:23.869
I spent my entire career
chasing down rogue traders,

33:23.871 --> 33:26.538
only to see my agency
get defanged

33:26.540 --> 33:31.210
when the country needed us
watching the closest.

33:31.212 --> 33:32.544
Pity.

33:32.546 --> 33:34.129
You can't beat 'em,
you join 'em.

33:34.131 --> 33:35.914
And make millions
along the way.

33:35.916 --> 33:38.634
300 million, to be exact.
Where are we?

33:38.636 --> 33:41.503
Tritak was down to $4 a share
by closing bell today.

33:41.505 --> 33:44.372
When the market opens tomorrow,
it'll be $2.

33:44.374 --> 33:45.707
I've got buy orders in place

33:45.709 --> 33:47.476
to pick up the shares
that we need.

33:47.478 --> 33:48.877
And the loose ends?

33:48.879 --> 33:51.063
Well, Baylor won't be asking
any more questions,

33:51.065 --> 33:55.067
but Adam is still out there.

33:55.069 --> 33:57.069
He could be a problem.

33:57.071 --> 34:01.890
I have it under control.

34:10.900 --> 34:13.368
You'd be better off
balling up that paper

34:13.370 --> 34:15.286
and stuffing it
under your clothes.

34:15.289 --> 34:17.389
It'll keep you warm.

34:19.125 --> 34:21.460
See, how did--
How did it get to this?

34:21.462 --> 34:23.210
I mean...

34:23.213 --> 34:26.797
I earned everything
that I achieved in my life.

34:28.250 --> 34:30.752
I know.

34:30.754 --> 34:33.688
- Your uncle told us.
- You talked to him?

34:36.257 --> 34:38.927
He told us about your father

34:38.929 --> 34:42.313
and the $200 he'd send you.

34:45.368 --> 34:46.902
He doesn't know
the end of the story.

34:46.904 --> 34:51.822
He doesn't know when I was 16,
I went to go find my father.

34:51.824 --> 34:55.777
I took a train to New Mexico,
and I found him...

34:57.446 --> 35:01.617
And he had a-a new family.

35:01.619 --> 35:04.886
And then when I went to him,

35:04.888 --> 35:08.757
he tried to hand me
another $200.

35:13.896 --> 35:17.182
I didn't want the money.

35:17.184 --> 35:20.569
I wanted a family.

35:22.021 --> 35:25.691
And you found one...

35:25.693 --> 35:28.309
An uncle who spent his life

35:28.311 --> 35:31.980
slaving over
a food-truck counter...

35:31.982 --> 35:34.783
For you.

35:34.785 --> 35:38.837
I'll get Bob's money back.
I promised him that I would.

35:40.423 --> 35:43.992
When did you talk
to your uncle?

36:03.872 --> 36:06.123
Get down!

36:16.135 --> 36:18.135
What are you doing?
We need to go! We need to move!

36:18.137 --> 36:19.619
Stay down.

36:29.180 --> 36:30.948
Now move.

36:46.814 --> 36:49.583
So Paul was working
with Rasmussen all along?

36:49.585 --> 36:52.586
On a massive short-sell bet
against Tritak.

36:52.588 --> 36:54.805
It's lost 90%
of its value already.

36:54.807 --> 36:58.625
But an SEC investigator
and a banker do not shoot up

36:58.627 --> 37:01.094
a homeless encampment
with automatic weapons.

37:01.096 --> 37:04.298
No. There was
some serious muscle behind this.

37:04.300 --> 37:05.498
How's Adam doing?

37:05.500 --> 37:08.018
Not bad for a guy
who's lost everything.

37:08.020 --> 37:09.770
Does he still have a suit?

37:09.772 --> 37:12.606
- Why?
- Paul and Rasmussen need Tritak

37:12.608 --> 37:15.058
to bottom out before
they can collect on their bet.

37:15.060 --> 37:17.694
What are you
talking about, Finch?

37:17.696 --> 37:20.113
Ever try to catch
a falling knife, Mr. Reese?

37:20.115 --> 37:22.682
Sounds like
a good way to get cut.

37:22.684 --> 37:25.535
Which is why we need
a damn good investment banker.

37:25.537 --> 37:29.906
Have Adam put on a tie.
He's going back to work.

37:33.128 --> 37:35.879
Tritak,
I need 1,000 units of Tritak.

37:35.881 --> 37:39.199
I need to buy.
I got to buy on Tritak.

37:39.201 --> 37:41.251
What the hell?

37:41.253 --> 37:43.920
Victor, I need your help.

37:43.922 --> 37:46.473
I've got buy orders here
for 4 million shares of Tritak.

37:46.475 --> 37:48.008
Can you fill these immediately?

37:48.010 --> 37:50.010
Uh, I can buy what's available,

37:50.012 --> 37:52.712
but some new player
hit the market hard today--

37:52.714 --> 37:54.014
Been buying all morning.

37:54.016 --> 37:56.383
There's a lot out there to buy.
I mean, would you look?

37:56.385 --> 37:59.386
Tritak just hit 15 a unit.

37:59.388 --> 38:01.321
By the time
the dumb money gets back in,

38:01.323 --> 38:02.773
it'll be at an all-time high.

38:02.775 --> 38:04.274
Who's the new player?

38:04.276 --> 38:06.059
Anonymous.

38:06.061 --> 38:08.862
But I have a number.

38:08.864 --> 38:12.065
Maybe you can strike a deal.

38:17.455 --> 38:19.589
Hey, you called.
What's going on?

38:19.591 --> 38:23.410
I'm saving our asses.
That's what's going on.

38:26.581 --> 38:28.465
This is Harold Crane.
Yes?

38:28.467 --> 38:31.535
Sir, this is Paul Ashton
with Baylor Zimm Investments.

38:31.537 --> 38:32.769
I need to speak with you

38:32.771 --> 38:34.438
about your majority share
in Tritak Energy.

38:34.440 --> 38:36.973
I'm sorry. You'll need to
speak to my banker about that.

38:36.975 --> 38:39.943
No, sir! I--

38:43.282 --> 38:45.348
Sorry, Paul,
but my little buying frenzy

38:45.350 --> 38:47.884
just reinvigorated
the Tritak MLP,

38:47.886 --> 38:49.369
and I own all the shares.

38:49.371 --> 38:52.739
Don't worry.
I'll sell you what you need.

38:52.741 --> 38:56.943
After all,
what are friends for?

38:56.945 --> 38:58.962
Your little game
of "hide the short"...

38:58.964 --> 39:01.331
Only works when it's legal.

39:01.333 --> 39:03.083
You can't prove anything.

39:03.085 --> 39:07.304
No, I can't, but Victor
and a dozen other brokers

39:07.306 --> 39:10.457
just lining up
to testify against you--

39:10.459 --> 39:14.010
They'll do anything
to avoid jail time.

39:14.012 --> 39:16.430
Let us through here.
That's the guy.

39:16.432 --> 39:18.899
Over here.

39:21.235 --> 39:23.286
There! Get him!

39:27.358 --> 39:31.244
John Rooney, Assets.

39:54.802 --> 39:58.138
It's all of it, all your money.

39:58.140 --> 40:00.690
You were the only person that
I counted on when I was younger,

40:00.692 --> 40:03.226
and I wish that
you could have counted on me,

40:03.228 --> 40:07.013
and I hope that someday
maybe you can forgive me.

40:11.369 --> 40:13.453
Of course I forgive you, kid.

40:13.455 --> 40:15.355
You're family.

40:15.357 --> 40:17.908
Of course I forgive you...

40:17.910 --> 40:20.744
Even if I can't stand
your taste in suits.

40:20.746 --> 40:22.162
So let me ask you this--

40:22.164 --> 40:24.164
What are we gonna do
about reinvesting?

40:24.166 --> 40:25.832
I think that maybe
you and I could look

40:25.834 --> 40:27.250
into franchising the business,

40:27.252 --> 40:30.153
but first I got some people
I want you to feed.

40:32.674 --> 40:35.725
I didn't know what you were into
before we met, John,

40:35.727 --> 40:37.877
and I don't know now, but...

40:37.879 --> 40:40.680
You sure know
how to keep things interesting.

40:40.682 --> 40:43.716
I saw signs posted downstairs.

40:43.718 --> 40:46.686
Someone finally bought
this old place.

40:46.688 --> 40:49.389
"New ownership."

40:51.025 --> 40:53.493
It looks like we'll have
to make camp elsewhere.

40:55.697 --> 40:58.999
Actually...

40:59.001 --> 41:00.200
I know the new owner.

41:00.202 --> 41:01.868
He's a smart kid...

41:01.870 --> 41:06.072
With a good head
on his shoulders.

41:09.010 --> 41:11.294
I don't think you'll have
to be moving anywhere.

41:11.296 --> 41:14.598
Hey...

41:14.600 --> 41:18.468
I never said thank you...

41:18.470 --> 41:21.388
For looking after me
when I needed it.

41:21.390 --> 41:24.591
Who's looking after you
these days?

41:24.593 --> 41:27.093
Someone new.

41:39.657 --> 41:41.575
Some big-shot broker, huh?

41:41.577 --> 41:43.209
Where's the other one?

41:43.211 --> 41:45.295
What other one?

41:45.297 --> 41:47.130
There are supposed to be
two suspects.

41:47.132 --> 41:49.132
You talking about the SEC guy?

41:49.134 --> 41:50.333
Yeah.

41:50.335 --> 41:52.385
They found him dead
in his apartment in Queens--

41:52.387 --> 41:55.121
Self-inflicted GSW to the head.

41:55.123 --> 41:59.392
Guess he couldn't stand
the thought of Otisville.

41:59.394 --> 42:00.793
Hmm.

42:00.795 --> 42:04.397
I heard
they both were arrested.

42:04.399 --> 42:07.567
I don't know what to tell you.

42:32.543 --> 42:34.994
I was thinking...

42:34.996 --> 42:38.932
All of this was all too slick,

42:38.934 --> 42:41.184
too complicated.

42:41.186 --> 42:43.836
A stockbroker and a finance cop
couldn't pull this off.

42:43.838 --> 42:47.006
No, there was someone else
behind the scenes,

42:47.008 --> 42:49.476
someone who hired
a team of assassins,

42:49.478 --> 42:52.479
who knew a bill would pass
in state government

42:52.481 --> 42:54.280
weeks before it did,

42:54.282 --> 42:57.617
someone who could use
$300 million

42:57.619 --> 42:59.586
to finance a personal war.

43:04.024 --> 43:05.692
So what's this?

43:05.694 --> 43:07.627
The bigger picture.

43:20.675 --> 43:22.676
Hello, John.

43:22.678 --> 43:25.695
It's been a long time.
