WEBVTT

00:00.156 --> 00:02.007
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

00:02.017 --> 00:03.278
We found a key, too.

00:03.296 --> 00:05.066
The ghost said it has the power

00:05.077 --> 00:08.012
to reveal things that are hidden.
I'm a hidden thing.

00:08.023 --> 00:09.074
I'm Hyman.

00:09.085 --> 00:12.686
When I first got stuck
in the Astral Plane,

00:12.697 --> 00:15.103
I spent months trying to push things.

00:15.114 --> 00:19.025
I never got anywhere.
Until I tried being the thing.

00:19.043 --> 00:20.992
Holy zerts! You did it!

00:21.003 --> 00:24.696
The farmers are hesitant because
you're asking them to throw out food

00:24.706 --> 00:27.599
- and replace it with, uh...
- Inedible mushrooms.

00:27.609 --> 00:30.435
I got it. I just need it done.

00:30.445 --> 00:33.338
On Earth we tend to meet the
people we're gonna marry first.

00:33.348 --> 00:37.276
<i>Surely you've heard of the
Tribe of The Floating Mountain.</i>

00:38.854 --> 00:40.813
It is my duty and honor

00:40.823 --> 00:42.881
to take the place of my late brother.

00:42.891 --> 00:45.284
<i>- Why do you have magic?
- I don't know.</i>

00:45.294 --> 00:46.785
I'd do anything to get it back.

00:46.795 --> 00:49.121
If I could give it to you, I would.

00:49.131 --> 00:51.097
What if you could?

00:58.177 --> 01:00.666
Whoo. Sorry.

01:00.676 --> 01:02.242
Okay.

01:06.315 --> 01:08.307
Last I checked,
we're looking for a spell,

01:08.317 --> 01:09.533
not starting an eBay store.

01:09.544 --> 01:12.810
There's this old hedge story
I once heard

01:12.821 --> 01:14.955
about some sort of electrical transfer.

01:14.966 --> 01:18.306
Marina used to steal magic
from some poor faun.

01:18.317 --> 01:20.548
People still talk about it.

01:20.940 --> 01:22.439
Just look.

01:25.900 --> 01:27.767
So, you want us to reverse engineer

01:27.778 --> 01:30.062
a hedge witch urban legend
using kids' toys?

01:30.073 --> 01:32.565
I mean, aluminum wiring's
been scant since the '90s,

01:32.575 --> 01:34.534
so unless you have a better idea.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:57.066 --> 01:58.691
Do you feel anything?

01:58.701 --> 01:59.800
No.

02:00.937 --> 02:02.236
Go again?

02:06.853 --> 02:08.735
♪ Oh, as long as I know ♪

02:08.745 --> 02:10.402
♪ How to love, I know I'll stay alive ♪

02:10.413 --> 02:12.538
Why did that just turn on by itself?

02:12.548 --> 02:13.873
Oh, my God.

02:13.883 --> 02:15.241
♪ I've got all my love to give ♪

02:15.251 --> 02:16.976
♪ And I'll survive ♪

02:16.986 --> 02:19.545
Give me your hand.

02:19.555 --> 02:21.414
Wait. Stop.

02:21.424 --> 02:23.082
Do not do this.

02:23.092 --> 02:24.762
Did you just use
that fish as a doorbell?

02:24.773 --> 02:26.556
I've been trying to warn you
guys for, like, an hour.

02:26.567 --> 02:28.087
"Being the fish button"
is the first thing

02:28.097 --> 02:29.722
in this entire room that's worked.

02:29.732 --> 02:32.091
- What are you trying to warn us about?
- This spell.

02:32.101 --> 02:33.493
I've seen it in person.

02:33.503 --> 02:35.094
Are you serious?

02:35.104 --> 02:36.400
Yeah.

02:37.140 --> 02:39.165
Couple months back
on a book-stealing job,

02:39.175 --> 02:41.434
I saw a group of
magically-starved idiots

02:41.444 --> 02:44.203
do the transfer, and by the end of it,

02:44.213 --> 02:46.180
everyone was on fire.

02:47.314 --> 02:49.008
Trust me. Fogg was right.

02:49.019 --> 02:50.986
It's a bad idea.

02:52.255 --> 02:55.281
Wait a minute. Did you
just say Fogg was right?

02:55.291 --> 02:57.250
- Aw, f...
- Fuck me.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.918
You have magic.

02:58.928 --> 03:00.353
And you're just now telling me?

03:00.363 --> 03:02.822
Don't take this the wrong way,

03:02.832 --> 03:05.191
but you've been a little drunk.

03:05.201 --> 03:07.460
- And unreliable.
- Yes.

03:07.470 --> 03:11.931
I'm drunk, but I am
entirely... reliable.

03:14.310 --> 03:17.336
Um, maybe we should get back
to Marina's spell.

03:17.346 --> 03:19.505
It wasn't Marina's spell. It's mine.

03:19.515 --> 03:22.608
She stole it from my private collection.

03:22.618 --> 03:25.111
And if any of you had attended
my annual colloquia

03:25.121 --> 03:27.480
on prohibited magic, you would know

03:27.490 --> 03:30.116
that its proper name
is the Voltaic Transfer.

03:30.126 --> 03:32.185
It is incredibly delicate.

03:32.195 --> 03:34.120
- We... we know that, but...
- But what?

03:34.130 --> 03:35.688
But you want to rid yourself

03:35.698 --> 03:38.324
of the one thing we all
so desperately want?

03:38.334 --> 03:41.160
- If you understood what...
- You understand.

03:41.170 --> 03:43.329
I'm a Magician with no magic.

03:43.339 --> 03:45.832
A dean without a school.

03:45.842 --> 03:48.467
Just a blind, unemployed

03:48.477 --> 03:51.270
black man in America.

03:51.280 --> 03:56.576
Which, shockingly, was actually
being kept 38% more tolerant

03:56.586 --> 03:58.477
through a series of enchantments

03:58.487 --> 04:00.677
which have now died.

04:00.688 --> 04:02.915
In case you hadn't noticed
or perhaps maybe you weren't

04:02.926 --> 04:04.958
- in a position to need to.
- Okay, you're really drunk.

04:04.969 --> 04:06.060
So what?

04:07.730 --> 04:10.256
What does it matter?

04:10.266 --> 04:12.225
Alice, of all people,
you should know better

04:12.235 --> 04:13.826
than to attempt this.

04:13.836 --> 04:16.546
You want to blow yourselves up?
Is that it?

04:19.742 --> 04:22.509
Um. Just give me one second.

04:25.514 --> 04:27.173
Okay.

04:53.576 --> 04:55.234
Uh, they'll hold for a day or two,

04:55.244 --> 04:57.044
but then Alice can recharge them.

04:58.314 --> 05:00.940
After we finish the transfer.

05:00.950 --> 05:04.110
I know. Everything is fucked.

05:04.120 --> 05:06.579
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault.

05:06.589 --> 05:08.273
Julia.

05:08.284 --> 05:10.949
Yeah, well, it's not
<i>not</i> my fault, either so.

05:10.960 --> 05:13.986
What you two utter idiots need,

05:13.996 --> 05:15.755
if you don't want to die,

05:15.765 --> 05:17.757
is the flesh of a magical creature

05:17.767 --> 05:20.960
to act as a sort of semiconductor.

05:20.970 --> 05:24.638
A potent energy-drainer. An incubus.

05:29.478 --> 05:30.770
<i>If this is about the whole</i>

05:30.780 --> 05:32.204
marriage not being consummated yet,

05:32.214 --> 05:33.906
don't worry, it'll happen.

05:33.916 --> 05:36.642
Oh, no, no, no.
You misunderstand me, my dear.

05:36.652 --> 05:39.245
You see, I've heard a rumor
about your advisor,

05:39.255 --> 05:41.914
the Pickwick?
Sighted in a certain corridor.

05:41.924 --> 05:43.616
Taking scrapings from the wall.

05:43.626 --> 05:45.484
He's just a compulsive redecorator.

05:45.494 --> 05:48.154
You might be interested to
know that we both have been

05:48.164 --> 05:50.756
plotting against our mutual friend.

05:52.301 --> 05:55.261
No idea what you're talking about.

05:55.271 --> 05:57.630
Margo.

05:57.640 --> 05:59.165
You can trust me.

05:59.175 --> 06:01.133
The misguided actions of my son

06:01.143 --> 06:04.837
have soured both sides
of our arrangement.

06:04.848 --> 06:08.883
I've acquired a weapon forged
in the foundries of Stonehaven.

06:09.653 --> 06:11.609
When the time is right,

06:11.620 --> 06:14.021
we could use it to kill the Fairy Queen.

06:18.728 --> 06:21.854
- Hi.
- Oh, hell no.

06:21.864 --> 06:23.589
Move.

06:23.599 --> 06:25.992
Hang your sheets out
the window afterwards, dear.

06:26.002 --> 06:28.060
Guards! Guards!

06:28.070 --> 06:30.196
Don't even think about closing it. No!

06:30.206 --> 06:33.366
Guards!

06:35.378 --> 06:36.477
Let me out!

06:43.633 --> 06:47.140
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

06:47.957 --> 06:50.016
<i>I don't give a shit
if you have to find someone</i>

06:50.026 --> 06:51.584
to sell those shares short.

06:51.594 --> 06:53.227
I need them today.

06:54.043 --> 06:56.259
So the Incubus
is a hedge fund manager?

06:56.270 --> 06:59.458
Plus 5%. And not one more cent,
you piece of monkey shit.

06:59.468 --> 07:01.527
Just remember what Fogg said.

07:01.537 --> 07:03.863
Be respectful, no matter what.

07:03.873 --> 07:05.398
You got two minutes.

07:05.408 --> 07:07.767
Henry Fogg said that you might be able

07:07.777 --> 07:09.502
to help us power our spell.

07:09.512 --> 07:13.339
Uh, we just... we need
to use your thing.

07:13.349 --> 07:15.875
- My what?
- Uh, your... your thing.

07:15.885 --> 07:18.511
Your... your business.

07:18.521 --> 07:20.179
- Sorry?
- Uh.

07:20.189 --> 07:23.816
Your little friend.
Uh, I mean... your big friend.

07:23.826 --> 07:25.918
Well, I'm... I'm sure your friend

07:25.928 --> 07:28.054
is perfectly proportioned to your body.

07:28.064 --> 07:32.124
- I was just saying...
- Your penis.

07:32.134 --> 07:35.861
Yep, we need to use your penis
to power our spell.

07:35.871 --> 07:37.730
And we know that you need it too.

07:37.740 --> 07:39.932
So that's why we'll build
the spell around it.

07:39.942 --> 07:41.434
It'll be completely painless

07:41.444 --> 07:43.010
and should only take a couple minutes.

07:55.658 --> 07:57.983
I can't believe that actually worked!

07:57.993 --> 07:59.985
Wha... what actually worked?

07:59.995 --> 08:02.822
I planted this joke on Fogg
25 years ago.

08:02.832 --> 08:05.157
I had him totally convinced
that I had a magic Johnson.

08:05.167 --> 08:07.326
Wait, so you...
you don't have a magic...

08:07.336 --> 08:08.564
Of course not.

08:08.575 --> 08:10.096
- That's ridiculous.
- No, it's not.

08:10.106 --> 08:11.897
I mean you're an incubus.

08:11.907 --> 08:14.400
Isn't sex, like, your thing?

08:14.410 --> 08:16.435
Gods no.

08:16.445 --> 08:17.803
I don't even like sex.

08:17.813 --> 08:22.174
Stress is a much better way
to drain people's energy.

08:22.184 --> 08:23.476
May I?

08:28.791 --> 08:32.551
Oh, and you.

08:32.561 --> 08:35.020
You got a lot of it, I can tell.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.960
Delish.

08:40.970 --> 08:43.863
You give me
a few more hits of this,

08:43.873 --> 08:45.297
and I'll give you something

08:45.307 --> 08:47.574
that'll actually power your spell.

08:54.717 --> 08:57.143
- Is that your tail?
- Yeah.

08:57.153 --> 08:58.886
Yeah, I grow a new one every spring.

09:02.024 --> 09:03.549
Welcome back.

09:03.559 --> 09:06.318
I see you've misplaced
your wife and child.

09:06.328 --> 09:09.788
You'd be shocked how easy
it is to misplace people

09:09.798 --> 09:12.958
when your mind's on
tax collection and annexation

09:12.968 --> 09:16.136
and unforeseen seafaring... confusion.

09:18.353 --> 09:20.412
I'll immediately sail
back out there and find them,

09:20.423 --> 09:22.001
- of course...
- No, you won't.

09:22.011 --> 09:24.670
I have a bigger problem
I need you to solve.

09:24.680 --> 09:28.507
The Stone Queen has locked
Margo and Fomar in the dungeon.

09:28.517 --> 09:30.709
Wait. What? Why?

09:30.719 --> 09:34.313
She thinks it will get
the marriage consummated,

09:34.323 --> 09:37.249
but ultimately I need
the union officialized

09:37.259 --> 09:39.018
just as much as the Floaters do.

09:39.028 --> 09:40.853
Listen, pro tip.

09:40.863 --> 09:42.988
Let Margo out of there immediately.

09:42.998 --> 09:45.191
You know her. Force isn't going to work.

09:45.201 --> 09:48.527
True. Force may not work.

09:48.537 --> 09:51.530
But the clever coercion on
the part of a trusted friend.

09:51.540 --> 09:52.998
I am not going to coerce Margo

09:53.008 --> 09:54.934
into having sex with a 15-year-old.

09:54.944 --> 09:56.495
Have you never heard of statutory rape?

09:56.506 --> 09:59.772
- Fomar isn't a statue.
- That is not what...

09:59.782 --> 10:01.240
Forget it.

10:01.250 --> 10:03.943
You will solve this problem for me.

10:03.953 --> 10:05.452
And if I refuse?

10:08.857 --> 10:12.618
I've been searching for a new keepsake.

10:12.628 --> 10:14.553
Several bits will do.

10:14.563 --> 10:17.256
Fine, but I have a feeling Queen Margo

10:17.266 --> 10:19.758
is going to be a little bit difficult.

10:21.537 --> 10:22.561
I know!

10:22.571 --> 10:24.663
You hate me for killing Micah.

10:24.673 --> 10:26.532
Jesus Christ.

10:26.542 --> 10:27.800
It's just in our culture,

10:27.810 --> 10:31.370
younger sons can't marry
or inherit property.

10:31.380 --> 10:33.239
Most of us wind up

10:33.249 --> 10:36.141
serving in the Crag Guard
or dying in battle.

10:36.151 --> 10:38.244
Is this supposed to make me
feel bad for you?

10:38.254 --> 10:40.179
No.

10:40.189 --> 10:41.580
So, do you want to take a break?

10:41.590 --> 10:43.182
Let me touch your maiden peaks?

10:43.193 --> 10:45.251
Do you want me to cut your
hands off and have them made

10:45.261 --> 10:46.819
into a decorative, whimsical planter?

10:46.829 --> 10:49.421
How are we supposed to become one flesh

10:49.431 --> 10:51.423
if you won't let me touch you?

10:51.433 --> 10:53.292
- We're not.
- But you're my wife.

10:53.302 --> 10:54.893
Oh, please.

10:54.903 --> 10:56.729
You don't need a wife.

10:56.739 --> 10:59.031
You need a pile of socks
and a sex-ed class.

10:59.041 --> 11:02.434
What's a sex class? Who... who's Ed?

11:02.444 --> 11:04.069
It's something they make you
do on Earth.

11:04.079 --> 11:05.412
It makes you never wanna.

11:07.516 --> 11:09.216
How about I show you?

11:16.025 --> 11:17.483
Vaginas.

11:17.493 --> 11:20.286
The leading cause of death in men.

11:20.296 --> 11:22.421
They spread disease.

11:22.431 --> 11:24.623
They explode during childbirth.

11:26.302 --> 11:29.662
But worst of all, they bleed.
Every month.

11:29.672 --> 11:32.498
In fact, mine's doing it right now.

11:32.508 --> 11:35.375
Well, that's okay. I like blood.

11:38.547 --> 11:40.614
But do you like teeth?

11:43.485 --> 11:45.811
Sorry I'm late.

11:45.821 --> 11:47.179
You okay?

11:47.189 --> 11:49.548
Enjoying being a palace guard
in your own palace?

11:49.558 --> 11:51.650
This uniform is, like, really sweaty.

11:51.660 --> 11:53.786
Yeah, I know, but it beats

11:53.796 --> 11:55.570
having the Fairy Queen's
hand up your ass.

11:55.581 --> 11:58.190
Last thing we need
is another puppet king.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.559
Okay, key quest. Hit me.

12:00.569 --> 12:03.462
Uh, okay, so I'm pretty sure that

12:03.472 --> 12:05.164
the fourth key is somewhere

12:05.174 --> 12:07.132
in this stretch of ocean
called The Abyss.

12:07.142 --> 12:09.468
Um, it's an uncharted region of Fillory

12:09.478 --> 12:13.138
where it's, like,
sort of permanently night.

12:13.148 --> 12:16.975
Um, but, you know, we get to go

12:16.985 --> 12:21.280
on a quest on a magical boat,
so it doesn't totally suck.

12:21.290 --> 12:24.383
Uh, yeah. I wish I could.

12:24.393 --> 12:27.252
Believe me, but duty calls
a dozen different ways.

12:27.262 --> 12:29.688
- And I can't leave Margo.
- Right, of course.

12:29.698 --> 12:31.824
- Sorry.
- No.

12:31.834 --> 12:34.226
I was looking forward to going
on a boating quest with you.

12:34.236 --> 12:35.902
Who wouldn't?

12:38.040 --> 12:40.099
Uh, think about it.
You can take Benedict.

12:40.109 --> 12:42.735
Go be life-partners with
someone else for a little bit.

12:42.745 --> 12:46.038
But you'll be able to do the...
thing on the prow of a ship

12:46.048 --> 12:47.706
you've been waiting
your whole life to do.

12:47.716 --> 12:50.784
- What thing?
- You know, the thing.

13:04.900 --> 13:07.367
Whoo!

13:14.076 --> 13:16.176
Sorry. Uh, sorry.

13:25.921 --> 13:27.387
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

13:42.738 --> 13:46.064
Being on a mission is a hell
of an antidepressant.

13:46.074 --> 13:47.399
You notice that, Benedict?

13:47.409 --> 13:49.142
Well, now that you mention it.

13:51.380 --> 13:52.805
Whoa.

13:52.815 --> 13:54.514
We're entering The Abyss, Sire.

13:57.653 --> 14:00.520
It'll be darkness from here on.

14:03.792 --> 14:05.559
Thank you.

14:16.939 --> 14:19.164
So how long until we can keep going?

14:19.174 --> 14:21.667
As soon as we find safe
passage, your Majesty.

14:21.677 --> 14:23.836
Is someone out there?

14:23.846 --> 14:25.445
Help!

14:27.316 --> 14:30.450
Is someone out there? Help!

14:34.990 --> 14:37.524
God, I think there's someone
out there on a raft.

14:44.800 --> 14:45.958
You okay?

14:45.968 --> 14:47.259
Wow, wow, wow.

14:47.269 --> 14:49.595
You just saved the shit out of me.

14:49.605 --> 14:51.363
Poppy Kline.

14:51.373 --> 14:54.399
Draconologist, postgraduate
fellow, and field researcher

14:54.409 --> 14:56.468
at your service.

14:56.478 --> 14:59.813
Holy shit. You're from Brakebills?

15:00.983 --> 15:02.148
Yeah.

15:06.386 --> 15:08.646
So, Brakebills students
are kings and queens now?

15:08.656 --> 15:09.680
Yeah. So hu-Shit.now.

15:09.690 --> 15:12.016
I've stuck in The Abyss way too long.

15:12.026 --> 15:13.483
How did you end up out here anyway?

15:13.494 --> 15:15.124
Oh, I came with some other students.

15:15.135 --> 15:17.821
Oh. Hey, sorry. I can, um... uh.

15:17.831 --> 15:20.257
Spring Break, Class of 2016?

15:20.267 --> 15:21.659
Didn't turn out so well for us,

15:21.669 --> 15:23.727
but that is a whole nother story.

15:24.228 --> 15:25.451
Wait, sorry.

15:25.458 --> 15:26.682
Do you know, um...

15:26.693 --> 15:28.561
If the next two words out
of your mouth are "Josh"

15:28.572 --> 15:30.420
and "Hoberman,"
we just became best friends.

15:30.431 --> 15:32.236
No way. He's still alive?

15:32.246 --> 15:34.505
I mean, as far as I know.

15:34.515 --> 15:36.106
Oh, that's amazing.

15:36.116 --> 15:38.008
So how does a Brakebills student

15:38.018 --> 15:40.511
wind up alone on a raft?

15:40.521 --> 15:43.414
Get a girl a drink.
I'll tell you the whole story.

15:43.424 --> 15:44.690
All right.

15:58.205 --> 16:00.197
Your Majesty.

16:00.207 --> 16:02.466
An urgent message
from Prince Ess of Loria.

16:02.476 --> 16:04.168
Wasn't Ess in the dungeon?

16:04.178 --> 16:05.536
High Queen Margo let him go

16:05.546 --> 16:06.971
as he was innocent of all charges.

16:06.981 --> 16:10.407
Oh, right. Yeah.

16:10.417 --> 16:11.783
Sorry about that.

16:16.690 --> 16:21.285
I figured out the problem.
Humans don't mate in captivity.

16:21.295 --> 16:24.121
What Margo and Fomar
need is a honeymoon.

16:24.131 --> 16:26.423
An hour's ride North, there is a forest

16:26.433 --> 16:28.592
with naturally-occurring aphrodisiacs

16:28.602 --> 16:31.328
that's guaranteed to get
that marriage consummated.

16:31.338 --> 16:33.564
Fine.

16:33.574 --> 16:35.265
- But if you fail...
- I know, I know.

16:35.275 --> 16:37.635
New keepsakes. Fingers, ears.

16:37.645 --> 16:39.737
Try your spleen.

16:39.747 --> 16:41.647
- Okay.
- Go.

16:43.083 --> 16:45.776
Fieldwork was my thing at
Brakebills, and well, dragons.

16:45.786 --> 16:47.244
Love them.

16:47.254 --> 16:49.313
Wait, so what happened to your ship?

16:49.323 --> 16:50.914
Oh, wrecked.

16:50.924 --> 16:52.483
Off the coast of the Truthwaters.

16:52.493 --> 16:55.285
I spent two years on that little Picket.

16:55.295 --> 16:58.956
And, bam.
Over in an instant.

16:58.966 --> 17:01.191
That was three weeks ago.

17:01.201 --> 17:05.029
You survived for three weeks
on a raft by yourself?

17:05.039 --> 17:07.931
Yeah, it was rough.

17:07.941 --> 17:09.066
Especially without magic.

17:09.076 --> 17:10.701
Do you know anything about why the hell

17:10.711 --> 17:13.069
- it just went out?
- I mean, um...

17:13.079 --> 17:15.506
I just hope someone's fixing it.

17:15.516 --> 17:18.776
That someone is, um, sort of me.

17:18.786 --> 17:23.881
Um, I'm on a... a quest, right,
for these golden keys.

17:23.891 --> 17:25.382
Right, so there's seven of them.

17:25.392 --> 17:28.619
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Golden keys?

17:28.629 --> 17:30.028
Like...

17:33.333 --> 17:35.826
- Holy shit. How did you...
- Short version?

17:35.836 --> 17:37.461
Stole it.

17:37.471 --> 17:39.730
Mid-voyage we wound up
on this random island,

17:39.740 --> 17:42.199
just, like, covered in treasure.

17:42.209 --> 17:44.002
A dragon breeding ground
which is like...

17:44.013 --> 17:45.853
Spontaneous orgasm.

17:45.864 --> 17:47.671
I mean, places like this are so rare.

17:47.681 --> 17:49.339
There are only two species of dragon

17:49.349 --> 17:51.024
that even build treasure-nests.

17:51.035 --> 17:53.242
Anyway, this was in one of them

17:53.253 --> 17:54.836
with a bunch of cool stuff.

17:54.847 --> 17:57.663
But the thing that got me was

17:57.674 --> 17:59.633
I could feel something coming off it.

17:59.643 --> 18:01.757
- Yeah.
- Even now.

18:01.768 --> 18:04.117
It's somehow not dead, right?

18:04.663 --> 18:07.341
And, you know, the dragons were
all horny and distracted,

18:07.351 --> 18:09.343
so I just took it.

18:09.353 --> 18:10.780
Just like that?

18:10.920 --> 18:13.213
I'm a person of questionable ethics.

18:13.223 --> 18:15.891
Here.

18:16.792 --> 18:20.127
It's yours, from one quester to another.

18:22.132 --> 18:24.055
- Wow. Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

18:24.066 --> 18:25.914
So do you know what it does?
I mean, each one

18:25.925 --> 18:27.894
sort of has a unique thing.

18:27.905 --> 18:29.508
I don't know.

18:29.842 --> 18:32.553
- Maybe you can figure it out.
- Yeah.

18:33.178 --> 18:36.303
Uh, here's to that.

18:43.987 --> 18:45.877
- You wanna? Yeah.
- Oh.

18:49.359 --> 18:51.760
Okay. Well, here goes nothing.

18:58.902 --> 19:01.662
Ugh, man, one of your wires
is coming loose.

19:01.672 --> 19:03.497
You're gonna kill yourselves!

19:03.507 --> 19:07.000
- Oh, my God. I can't...
- Golly Moses.

19:07.010 --> 19:08.936
You're right. They're
gonna kill themselves.

19:08.946 --> 19:11.371
Don't you have some shower to go haunt?

19:11.381 --> 19:13.540
Oh, no one's showering right now.

19:13.550 --> 19:15.676
Except Fogg, and he's asleep.

19:15.686 --> 19:17.845
Jesus, that man needs help.
Is he all right?

19:17.855 --> 19:20.414
Ah, just a bit zozzled, I think.

19:20.424 --> 19:23.617
He was quite naked.

19:23.627 --> 19:26.495
Remarkably... well-preserved.

19:27.798 --> 19:30.524
Guess it's possible to age gracefully.

19:30.534 --> 19:31.782
Oh, my God.

19:31.793 --> 19:33.774
Fuck, man. I can't watch this.

19:34.204 --> 19:36.864
See? This is what I love
about you, Penny.

19:36.874 --> 19:38.592
You act like you don't care,

19:38.603 --> 19:41.467
but really, you care most
in this whole story.

19:41.478 --> 19:43.570
Yeah, then... then why
is everyone acting

19:43.580 --> 19:45.486
like I'm not a part of it anymore?

19:45.512 --> 19:49.533
Maybe it's time to blouse
this popsicle stand.

19:49.953 --> 19:51.712
- You mean, leave?
- Why not?

19:51.722 --> 19:53.547
Go... go find a story to watch

19:53.557 --> 19:55.349
that doesn't make you so depressed.

19:55.359 --> 19:58.418
Oh, I think they did it.

20:04.835 --> 20:07.060
I'm having a good time.

20:11.408 --> 20:13.642
You just wait a second,
I'm gonna close...

20:38.051 --> 20:39.885
Rise and shine, princess.

20:41.155 --> 20:43.080
Who?

20:43.090 --> 20:45.149
The real question, dipshit,
is how you managed

20:45.159 --> 20:46.846
to black out after, what, five drinks?

20:46.857 --> 20:48.666
Why do you always have
to embarrass yourself?

20:48.677 --> 20:49.825
I don't...

20:50.731 --> 20:53.391
Okay. Uh...

20:53.401 --> 20:55.986
Um...

20:57.038 --> 20:58.763
Seriously.

20:58.773 --> 21:01.507
You hold your liquor
like a kindergartner.

21:04.412 --> 21:07.813
Sorry, um, can you... are
you... are you seeing this?

21:10.151 --> 21:11.309
Nobody cares, dude.

21:11.319 --> 21:14.145
They all have actual jobs, unlike you.

21:14.155 --> 21:15.946
Right, okay.

21:15.956 --> 21:17.489
No problem.

21:23.331 --> 21:25.489
- What the fuck did you do?
- Okay, I can explain.

21:25.499 --> 21:27.491
- What is this key?
- Just calm down.

21:27.501 --> 21:29.694
- It's all right.
- There's another me.

21:29.704 --> 21:31.996
And he's mean,
and no one else can see him.

21:32.006 --> 21:33.698
Nothing about this is all right.

21:33.708 --> 21:35.715
Okay, listen. Here's the deal.

21:35.726 --> 21:37.871
- The key does have a power.
- No shit.

21:37.882 --> 21:39.803
It takes the darkest parts of you

21:39.814 --> 21:42.973
and makes a... kind of...
well, you met it.

21:42.983 --> 21:46.344
It's kind of like a depression monster?

21:46.354 --> 21:50.081
Looks like you, talks like you.

21:50.091 --> 21:53.284
But don't worry, it can't
actually hurt you.

21:53.294 --> 21:55.319
- Unless...
- Unless?

21:55.329 --> 21:56.420
Unless it gets in your head

21:56.430 --> 21:58.022
and convinces you to hurt yourself.

21:58.032 --> 21:59.627
- Well...
- But you'll be fine.

21:59.638 --> 22:01.791
It only affects the last person
who touched the key.

22:01.802 --> 22:03.861
So just pass it along to someone else.

22:03.871 --> 22:06.997
- That's what we did.
- Who's we?

22:07.007 --> 22:08.332
My former shipmates.

22:08.342 --> 22:09.428
After I stole the key,

22:09.439 --> 22:10.901
we passed it from person to person

22:10.911 --> 22:14.138
until we, you know, ran out of options.

22:14.148 --> 22:16.407
What does that mean,
you ran out of options?

22:16.417 --> 22:19.412
Um. Hit an iceberg?

22:19.423 --> 22:21.211
I happened to be holding
the key when we sank

22:21.222 --> 22:23.514
'cause the rest of 'em
just couldn't handle it.

22:23.524 --> 22:25.182
You have to be, like, a badass about it,

22:25.192 --> 22:27.084
and what can I say?

22:27.094 --> 22:28.886
- They were weak.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

22:28.896 --> 22:32.056
Exactly how many of them
survived the key before you?

22:32.066 --> 22:34.425
Eh. Maybe, like, half?

22:34.435 --> 22:36.527
This key made half of your shipmates

22:36.537 --> 22:38.863
kill themselves, and you gave it to me?

22:38.873 --> 22:40.731
Yeah. But don't worry.

22:40.741 --> 22:43.768
They were all pretty
psychologically damaged already.

22:43.778 --> 22:45.936
You'll be fine.
You're so happy and positive.

22:45.946 --> 22:49.039
Mmmm, no. No, no.

22:49.049 --> 22:51.275
I'm not. This is like...

22:51.285 --> 22:52.710
It's like we're on a boat, okay?

22:52.720 --> 22:54.412
This is not how I usually am.

22:54.422 --> 22:56.213
You're usually
a wet blanket, self-pitying,

22:56.223 --> 22:57.248
party pooping dickwad.

22:57.258 --> 22:59.517
Shut up!

22:59.527 --> 23:01.719
You better pass that along fast.

23:01.729 --> 23:04.321
What? No! Not if there is a 50%

23:04.331 --> 23:05.823
chance of it killing the next person.

23:07.868 --> 23:10.261
Okay.

23:10.271 --> 23:12.897
Right, yep. I'll just hold on to it.

23:12.907 --> 23:14.965
Until we get back to Whitespire.

23:14.975 --> 23:17.001
- I can do that.
- Your choice.

23:17.011 --> 23:18.702
I mean, we're stuck in The Abyss

23:18.712 --> 23:19.837
till we found our way out.

23:19.847 --> 23:22.706
It could be days. It could be weeks.

23:22.716 --> 23:24.742
Oh, but hey. Don't stress.

23:24.752 --> 23:27.411
- You might be fine.
- You won't be.

23:27.421 --> 23:29.280
You know what?

23:29.290 --> 23:32.283
I have come up against you
before, asshole.

23:32.293 --> 23:34.718
Maybe a little more subtly,
but you and I both know

23:34.728 --> 23:36.253
that I've got a black belt.

23:36.263 --> 23:37.696
So come at me.

23:42.106 --> 23:43.692
The problem is your hair.

23:43.703 --> 23:45.470
I know you're just trying
to hide your face,

23:45.481 --> 23:47.498
but it really only makes it worse.

23:47.508 --> 23:49.099
Seriously, have you ever noticed

23:49.109 --> 23:50.734
that your face sort of
looks like a foot?

23:50.744 --> 23:52.303
If feet had frown lines?

23:52.313 --> 23:54.405
I mean, you're definitely
aging prematurely,

23:54.415 --> 23:57.308
which is a symptom
of early-onset Alzheimer's.

23:57.318 --> 23:59.977
Which, funny,
both your grandparents had.

23:59.987 --> 24:02.913
And you will definitely get it
so then you'll be

24:02.923 --> 24:04.615
a senile frowny foot-face.

24:04.625 --> 24:06.925
Jesus. Fuck.

24:08.696 --> 24:12.064
This is pointless. You can't run me off.

24:13.167 --> 24:15.334
You can't eat me off.

24:16.136 --> 24:18.537
You can't drink me off.

24:19.473 --> 24:22.466
You can't jerk me off.

24:22.476 --> 24:23.834
God, you're so vulgar.

24:23.844 --> 24:26.637
We had a thing going,
and you... you made it

24:26.647 --> 24:28.472
unnecessarily gross.

24:28.482 --> 24:32.176
You sick of the shallow, petty stuff?

24:32.186 --> 24:34.545
I get it.

24:34.555 --> 24:36.413
The thing is, I start on the outside,

24:36.423 --> 24:38.716
and I work my way into the core.

24:38.726 --> 24:42.319
The part of you
that kept magic from Julia

24:42.329 --> 24:43.721
when you could have helped her,

24:43.731 --> 24:46.588
that is what set her on that path.

24:46.599 --> 24:50.958
You got your best friend
sexually assaulted.

24:50.969 --> 24:53.521
And let's talk about
what happened to Alice.

24:53.532 --> 24:54.614
You ruined her.

24:54.625 --> 24:57.513
And she is never going to be
the girl that she was.

24:57.524 --> 25:00.080
You killed her,
and she is never coming back.

25:00.091 --> 25:04.208
How many people have to pay
the price for your heroics?

25:04.219 --> 25:05.778
Just stop!

25:05.789 --> 25:08.513
You are willing to destroy
everyone around you

25:08.524 --> 25:10.724
to find something
that makes you feel okay.

25:10.735 --> 25:12.982
But you are never gonna feel okay.

25:12.993 --> 25:15.753
No, stop. You're trying
to get in my head.

25:15.763 --> 25:17.229
Quentin.

25:18.819 --> 25:20.511
I am your head.

25:20.701 --> 25:23.602
You know I'm right because I am you.

25:29.076 --> 25:33.337
- To Mr. and Mrs...
- Fomar.

25:33.347 --> 25:35.606
Fomar.

25:35.616 --> 25:37.182
Bottoms up.

25:38.309 --> 25:42.580
Uh, in my culture,
the woman always drinks first.

25:42.590 --> 25:45.783
- Drink the wine, Margo.
- I don't wanna drink the wine.

25:45.793 --> 25:47.934
What I wanted was for you
to handle this, Eliot.

25:47.952 --> 25:49.744
You'll feel better if you just

25:49.755 --> 25:52.864
drink the wine, Margo.

26:04.411 --> 26:07.004
So, um...

26:07.014 --> 26:09.443
Do we have sex in the carriage?

26:09.454 --> 26:12.275
Or do we have sex outside?

26:12.286 --> 26:16.413
- Or do...
- I'm not having sex with you.

26:16.423 --> 26:19.883
You psychotic fetus.

26:19.893 --> 26:21.460
Ever.

26:29.670 --> 26:31.829
Either I just killed him with my rage

26:31.839 --> 26:33.263
or you drugged his wine.

26:33.273 --> 26:35.099
And to think...

26:35.109 --> 26:36.908
- You doubted me.
- To think.

26:38.545 --> 26:42.973
I just spent three days locked
in a dungeon with him.

26:42.983 --> 26:45.209
Okay. Yes, and that sucks.

26:45.219 --> 26:47.745
But we have a problem,
possibly much bigger

26:47.755 --> 26:49.419
than sleeping beauty over here.

26:49.430 --> 26:51.815
The fairies are up to something
in the Northern Orchards.

26:51.825 --> 26:53.784
They evacuated the villagers weeks ago

26:53.794 --> 26:55.953
and haven't let another human in since.

26:55.963 --> 26:59.323
Except Ess came through
on his way from Loria,

26:59.333 --> 27:01.392
and he saw some crazy shit.

27:01.402 --> 27:03.927
Rivers running red,
three-eyed fanged toads,

27:03.937 --> 27:06.864
mutant plant life, Chernobyl-level shit.

27:06.874 --> 27:09.867
I think the fairies might
be poisoning the ecosystem.

27:09.877 --> 27:13.437
Great, well, now I can't be mad at you.

27:13.447 --> 27:14.880
Thanks.

27:14.891 --> 27:16.755
I know, I wanted to fight, too,

27:16.766 --> 27:19.043
so that we could make up
and on the other side of it,

27:19.053 --> 27:21.712
- we could just...
- Be us again?

27:21.722 --> 27:23.714
Who are we now, El?

27:23.724 --> 27:25.149
We used to be glamorous,

27:25.159 --> 27:27.885
amazing mega-bitches.

27:27.895 --> 27:29.453
And now?

27:29.463 --> 27:33.824
We have depth and character.

27:33.834 --> 27:36.860
Let's decide... we'll find us again

27:36.870 --> 27:39.163
once we're done saving Fillory.

27:39.173 --> 27:40.472
Okay?

27:42.743 --> 27:44.234
Duty calls.

27:44.244 --> 27:46.144
Let's go see about these orchards.

27:51.919 --> 27:54.453
Which are...

27:58.158 --> 28:00.292
No longer here.

28:05.666 --> 28:07.592
Nothing is going to save you.

28:07.602 --> 28:08.960
Not Brakebills.

28:08.970 --> 28:11.930
Not Fillory. Not a quest.

28:11.940 --> 28:14.666
Just do it.

28:14.676 --> 28:16.668
Kill yourself.

28:16.678 --> 28:19.571
Make it stop.

28:19.581 --> 28:21.481
You know the way out.

28:32.461 --> 28:33.919
King Quentin, no!

28:33.929 --> 28:36.054
Oh, no, I wasn't. I was just...

28:36.064 --> 28:37.789
- I thought I saw something.
- Your Majesty,

28:37.799 --> 28:40.492
if I may, I understand
what you're contemplating.

28:40.502 --> 28:42.761
I thought about it too.

28:42.771 --> 28:46.364
Though I've never spoken
about it, of course.

28:46.374 --> 28:48.133
Why not?

28:48.143 --> 28:52.170
Well, you know what parents
teach you about emotions.

28:52.180 --> 28:57.209
That you should bottle them up
and never talk about them

28:57.219 --> 29:00.946
and turn them into, um,
maps, for example.

29:00.956 --> 29:03.215
Jesus, Benedict.

29:03.225 --> 29:05.016
Okay, we should talk about this.

29:05.026 --> 29:07.018
If it please you, Sire, but first,

29:07.028 --> 29:09.128
why don't we step away
from the edge of the boat?

29:12.000 --> 29:15.627
Yeah. I don't really trust
myself right now.

29:15.637 --> 29:20.365
You know, in old days,
when sailors would go mad,

29:20.375 --> 29:21.867
the crew would tie them to the mast.

29:21.877 --> 29:23.435
Isn't that funny?

29:23.445 --> 29:25.604
Oh, my God. Tie me to the mast.

29:29.050 --> 29:32.043
- No... no, Your Majesty.
- No, do it.

29:32.053 --> 29:34.679
Okay, swear to me, no matter what I say,

29:34.689 --> 29:38.750
that you will not untie me
until we get to Whitespire.

29:38.760 --> 29:42.254
Very well. I won't.

29:42.264 --> 29:43.863
Thank you.

30:11.526 --> 30:13.426
It worked.

30:15.297 --> 30:17.856
Thank you.

31:07.582 --> 31:11.109
Oh. I see the transfer worked.

31:11.119 --> 31:14.312
It's still small, I can feel
that, but I'm gonna grow it.

31:14.322 --> 31:16.681
I hope you'll be careful.

31:16.691 --> 31:19.517
I will be.

31:19.527 --> 31:23.521
You know that fixing my glasses

31:23.531 --> 31:25.757
won't fix me.

31:25.767 --> 31:27.659
Yeah, but they make all of this

31:27.669 --> 31:30.003
one speck less shitty.

31:37.278 --> 31:39.278
It smells like the fairy realm.

31:40.815 --> 31:42.607
We're so far North.

31:42.617 --> 31:45.443
The climate should be cold
and dry, not hot and moist.

31:45.453 --> 31:47.979
Yeah, well, they're such
moisture freaks.

31:47.989 --> 31:51.549
All that spritzing and bathing.

31:51.559 --> 31:53.885
You know, it's... it's like
they're afraid

31:53.895 --> 31:56.763
to dry out in Fillory or something.

31:58.833 --> 32:00.933
Oh, my God.

32:02.404 --> 32:05.330
The fuckers are terraforming.

32:05.340 --> 32:07.966
They're turning our kingdom
into a mushroom steam bath.

32:07.976 --> 32:09.801
- That is not okay.
- No.

32:09.811 --> 32:11.277
Definitely not.

32:13.481 --> 32:16.007
That mushroom just moved.

32:16.017 --> 32:18.217
- Really?
- Should I pluck it?

32:20.722 --> 32:22.147
I'm... I'm gonna do it.

32:22.157 --> 32:23.823
Mm. Margo, don't.

32:36.838 --> 32:39.272
It's a fairy embryo.

32:40.375 --> 32:42.701
- Really?
- These are eggs, El.

32:42.711 --> 32:44.102
I mean, really?

32:44.112 --> 32:45.937
The fairies aren't just terraforming.

32:45.947 --> 32:48.173
They're growing an army.

32:48.183 --> 32:49.515
Oh, fuck.

32:51.330 --> 32:54.391
I think these fairies might
actually qualify as Big Bads.

32:54.401 --> 32:56.259
I mean, think about all the crazy shit

32:56.269 --> 32:57.594
they've kept us busy with.

32:57.604 --> 33:01.598
Earthworms, adolescent
slug mash, turtle semen.

33:01.608 --> 33:04.534
This is all just
a thin frosting of whimsy

33:04.544 --> 33:07.704
on a cupcake of conspiracy.

33:07.714 --> 33:11.074
No, no, no, no, no, no.
This is a full-scale invasion.

33:11.084 --> 33:13.610
We need a plan bigger than just
assassinating the Queen.

33:13.620 --> 33:17.280
We need... we need... we
need... we need... we need...

33:17.290 --> 33:20.258
We need... Margo?

33:21.928 --> 33:24.388
Margo?

33:24.398 --> 33:26.223
Kidnapping. Hostages. Leverage.

33:26.233 --> 33:28.925
- Don't ask questions, go! Go!
- What the fuck?

33:28.935 --> 33:31.102
Go, go!

33:41.048 --> 33:43.040
It's a bitch, right?

33:43.050 --> 33:45.075
Imagine being stuck
on a raft with that thing.

33:45.085 --> 33:46.410
Have you tried distracting it?

33:46.420 --> 33:49.646
For some reason, mine
was really into seagulls.

33:49.656 --> 33:51.415
Wonder if that's because
I'm into seagulls?

33:51.425 --> 33:53.150
Please, fuck off.

33:53.160 --> 33:55.585
Look, I'm sorry I passed you the key.

33:55.595 --> 33:57.087
I really thought you could handle it.

33:57.097 --> 33:58.922
This is me handling it.

33:58.932 --> 34:01.925
No, no, you're right.

34:01.935 --> 34:04.227
I wish we'd thought of tying
ourselves up.

34:04.237 --> 34:06.596
That first day,
we passed it around randomly.

34:06.606 --> 34:08.565
That killed three of us off quick.

34:08.574 --> 34:10.300
Called it Bloody Tuesday.

34:10.310 --> 34:12.402
We figured out it affects
some people right away.

34:12.411 --> 34:14.245
Others, it takes time to wear down.

34:17.650 --> 34:20.476
You want me to take the key for a while?
Give you some relief?

34:20.487 --> 34:22.846
No.

34:22.856 --> 34:25.415
I don't trust you not
to pass it on to someone else.

34:25.425 --> 34:27.751
And I need it.

34:27.761 --> 34:29.820
- For the quest.
- Fine.

34:29.830 --> 34:32.022
Be a suffer-martyr.

34:32.032 --> 34:33.757
Look, the keys don't
just make you suffer.

34:33.766 --> 34:35.826
They help sometimes, too.

34:35.835 --> 34:39.096
Like with the keyholes
and shit like that.

34:39.106 --> 34:40.597
Keyholes, like...

34:40.607 --> 34:44.201
Like in the walls or clocks.

34:44.210 --> 34:46.369
Don't ask me how it works.

34:46.379 --> 34:48.705
So... so where do the keyholes go?

34:48.715 --> 34:52.476
To Earth or the Neitherlands
or wherever.

34:52.485 --> 34:54.686
Wait, wait. Are you serious?

35:00.184 --> 35:01.528
Stop it. What are you doing?

35:01.539 --> 35:03.267
I've been stuck here in
Fillory this whole time

35:03.278 --> 35:04.588
when I could have gone home?

35:04.598 --> 35:07.190
Hey. No, Poppy, stop it.

35:07.200 --> 35:09.793
Poppy, no. Stop.

35:09.803 --> 35:12.229
Poppy!

35:12.239 --> 35:14.431
I told you
you should've killed yourself.

35:17.310 --> 35:19.077
Okay.

35:21.739 --> 35:24.802
Okay, we just have one
outstanding problem.

35:24.813 --> 35:26.543
You kind of still need
to fuck your husband.

35:26.553 --> 35:28.753
Don't worry. I got this.

35:33.527 --> 35:37.854
Let's just say Ess was right
about the toads in these parts.

35:37.864 --> 35:41.091
- They've got three eyes?
- No, baby.

35:41.101 --> 35:42.934
They've got fangs.

35:49.442 --> 35:52.369
Oh! Oh, something bit my manhood.

35:52.379 --> 35:54.437
Congratulations, son. You just had sex.

35:54.447 --> 35:56.339
The first time's always painful.

35:56.349 --> 35:58.608
It's all those teeth
they've got down there.

35:58.618 --> 36:02.245
But, hey, you were amazing.

36:02.255 --> 36:04.447
What?

36:04.457 --> 36:06.157
I like to watch.

36:07.727 --> 36:10.086
Wanna go again?

36:12.299 --> 36:14.324
Benedict!

36:17.270 --> 36:19.796
Benedict, help!

36:19.806 --> 36:21.544
- Your Majesty?
- Oh, my God, Benedict.

36:21.555 --> 36:23.818
- Okay, untie me.
- Sire, you said not to untie you.

36:23.829 --> 36:26.303
No. No, no, no, no, no. Please, come on.
Okay, look.

36:26.313 --> 36:27.871
I'm not trying to kill myself.

36:27.881 --> 36:29.773
Poppy took the key, and she is trying

36:29.783 --> 36:31.308
to use it to get back to Earth.

36:31.318 --> 36:33.176
Just... okay, go find her yourself.

36:33.186 --> 36:35.779
Just whatever you do, do not
let her leave with that key.

36:35.789 --> 36:37.021
Yes, Your Majesty.

36:38.792 --> 36:40.225
God.

36:43.663 --> 36:45.255
No! Stop!

36:56.743 --> 36:59.544
- Hey, did you get it?
- I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

37:01.448 --> 37:03.607
I'm a terrible failure.

37:03.617 --> 37:05.850
Okay. It's okay.

37:06.920 --> 37:08.720
We'll get the key back somehow.

37:16.596 --> 37:18.162
Benedict.

37:21.468 --> 37:23.860
Hey, hey. Benedict.

37:23.870 --> 37:25.762
Whoa, Benedict, no. Hey, listen.

37:25.772 --> 37:29.466
Whatever it's telling you
to do, do not do it.

37:29.476 --> 37:31.835
I'm sorry.

37:31.845 --> 37:33.177
Benedict, no!

37:44.457 --> 37:46.791
Mm. Yummy.

38:12.133 --> 38:13.780
Penny, what's wrong?

38:13.799 --> 38:15.780
- Just saying goodbye.
- What?

38:16.137 --> 38:18.116
Goodbye? Where are you going?

38:18.127 --> 38:19.519
Just away.

38:19.530 --> 38:21.622
Away... wait.

38:22.010 --> 38:25.176
Fuck, I hate this thing.
Um. I don't understand.

38:25.187 --> 38:26.971
Is this because
of what happened with Kady?

38:26.982 --> 38:28.340
- No.
- Okay.

38:28.350 --> 38:29.708
Is it because we did the transfer?

38:29.718 --> 38:31.860
No. Look, I gotta go.

38:31.871 --> 38:33.612
Wait, will you just
talk to me for a second?

38:33.622 --> 38:36.147
You know what,
we barely know each other.

38:36.157 --> 38:39.017
Don't suddenly act like
you care just 'cause I'm going.

38:39.027 --> 38:40.221
I'm not acting.

38:40.232 --> 38:43.299
I do care. I don't want to see you go.
I don't want to see you give up.

38:43.310 --> 38:45.636
- Give up?
- Yeah.

38:45.647 --> 38:49.841
You're the one who had magic,
and you gave it away.

38:49.852 --> 38:52.712
What's your plan? Go back to law school?

38:52.723 --> 38:54.598
Live off your trust fund?

38:54.609 --> 38:57.202
Actually, no, my plan
was to take five minutes

38:57.212 --> 38:59.532
and try to remember what life was like

38:59.543 --> 39:01.902
without a god or a quest.

39:01.913 --> 39:03.775
Or some dead asshole bothering me.

39:03.785 --> 39:05.410
And, I don't know, frankly beyond that,

39:05.420 --> 39:06.811
it's none of your business.

39:06.821 --> 39:09.581
'Cause you have nothing beyond that.

39:15.797 --> 39:17.830
Penny wants to say goodbye.

39:19.567 --> 39:23.795
- You're leaving?
- I can't do this anymore.

39:23.805 --> 39:27.573
I can't be a ghost person
in my own life, okay?

39:31.546 --> 39:34.773
Why don't I just make you a new body?

39:34.783 --> 39:36.516
Like Mayakovsky did for me.

39:54.669 --> 39:56.461
A-plus job

39:56.471 --> 39:59.230
getting rid of me, gorgeous.

39:59.240 --> 40:01.145
Is this just a dream?

40:01.156 --> 40:04.116
That time you fell out
of a tree when you were 12.

40:04.411 --> 40:08.840
The bone in your arm healed
in six little weeks.

40:08.850 --> 40:11.351
How come your fear of heights never did?

40:16.624 --> 40:18.358
I'm not the bone.

40:19.594 --> 40:21.728
I'm the terror.

40:23.131 --> 40:26.291
I do love how you keep trying.

40:26.301 --> 40:32.831
And trying. And trying.

40:39.481 --> 40:41.006
I have not been punched

40:41.016 --> 40:42.340
that hard since Burning Man.

40:42.350 --> 40:45.351
Where is he? Where did he go?

40:46.855 --> 40:48.621
Why does it smell like barbeque?

40:52.151 --> 40:55.011
Benedict is dead,
and best-case-scenario,

40:55.030 --> 40:56.549
the dragon shits the key
into the bottom of the ocean.

40:56.560 --> 40:58.623
- Um, Quentin.
- Don't talk to me.

40:58.633 --> 41:00.658
- Please, I mean it.
- Okay.

41:00.668 --> 41:02.425
Just... Just one thing

41:02.436 --> 41:04.329
and I swear I will never
talk to you again.

41:04.339 --> 41:05.463
What?

41:05.473 --> 41:07.532
Dragons don't shit.

41:07.542 --> 41:09.501
Okay, great, fun fact. Thanks.

41:09.511 --> 41:11.236
No one knows exactly how it works,

41:11.246 --> 41:13.905
but what they ingest goes elsewhere.

41:13.915 --> 41:15.540
They're gatekeepers, you know?

41:15.550 --> 41:17.308
They don't just make portals.

41:17.318 --> 41:19.310
They are portals.

41:19.320 --> 41:22.714
So, actual best-case-scenario...

41:22.724 --> 41:25.483
The key went to the Underworld.

41:25.493 --> 41:27.994
- Mm.
- Oh, my God.

41:35.003 --> 41:36.561
If you're here, I'm practicing

41:36.571 --> 41:38.963
an Osseus Confervium. Bone-knitting.

41:38.973 --> 41:40.765
First step to building a new body.

41:40.775 --> 41:45.537
I know you can't see me, but I'm here.

41:45.547 --> 41:47.113
Thanks for giving a shit about me.

41:52.420 --> 41:53.812
Alice?

41:55.190 --> 41:57.348
Alice, you okay? Alice?

41:57.358 --> 42:00.251
God, Alice. Alice!

42:00.261 --> 42:03.455
God, this is... where's...

42:03.465 --> 42:05.223
Alice!

42:08.470 --> 42:12.564
Okay, okay, God. Come on.

42:12.574 --> 42:15.975
Come on, someone's got
