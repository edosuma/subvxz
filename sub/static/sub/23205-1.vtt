11:48.474 --> 11:50.309
If I may, sir...

11:50.342 --> 11:51.978
I believe
I have skills and ideas

11:52.011 --> 11:53.412
that go well beyond
punching numbers

11:53.445 --> 11:54.380
into an adding machine.

11:54.413 --> 11:55.857
Well, I've read about
this German fellow,

11:55.881 --> 11:57.516
Lilienthal, I believe,
who's developed

11:57.549 --> 12:00.086
a glider that can take
a man in the air, sir.

12:00.119 --> 12:01.387
Isn't that amazing?

12:01.420 --> 12:03.555
I mean, if you were
to apply that to this business,

12:03.589 --> 12:04.957
it would be revolutionary.

12:04.991 --> 12:07.826
Gentlemen!
Can I have your attention?

12:07.859 --> 12:09.695
You're all dismissed.

12:10.829 --> 12:12.098
Bankrupt?

12:12.131 --> 12:14.200
I thought the company
had a dozen trading ships.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.335
Yes, at the bottom
of the South China Sea.

12:16.935 --> 12:19.438
Typhoon sank 'em all.

12:56.575 --> 12:59.345

- Oh, you're in for it!

Hey.

13:01.080 --> 13:03.715
Oh, God! You're home early.

13:03.749 --> 13:05.317
And until further notice.

13:09.355 --> 13:11.457
Well, I didn't think
you were long for that job.

13:11.490 --> 13:13.292
Or any job, apparently.

13:13.325 --> 13:15.761

together so exciting.

Charity.

13:21.033 --> 13:23.735

I promised you.

13:23.769 --> 13:25.637

moseyed into the corral.

13:35.781 --> 13:36.948
Daddy!

13:36.982 --> 13:38.293
- Come here!
- Did you bring a present?

13:38.317 --> 13:39.851
A present for what?

13:39.885 --> 13:41.487
- For my birthday!
- Your what?

13:41.520 --> 13:44.190
- My birthday.
- It's not your birthday.

13:44.223 --> 13:47.126
Okay, I do have a present...

13:47.159 --> 13:49.261
but not just any present.
Oh, no.

13:49.295 --> 13:52.731
The most amazing
birthday present ever.

13:52.764 --> 13:55.301
This extraordinary machine
was originally created

13:55.334 --> 13:57.236
by Leonardo da Vinci,
400 years ago.

13:57.269 --> 13:59.605
But the blueprints had been
lost for centuries

13:59.638 --> 14:01.907
until just last week,
on a stormy night,

14:01.940 --> 14:04.042
when a sunken pirate ship
washed up

14:04.076 --> 14:05.844
on the shores of Nantucket.

14:05.877 --> 14:08.147
They found skeletons
and treasures

14:08.180 --> 14:09.981
and the blueprints
were recovered

14:10.015 --> 14:15.087
by none other
than J. W. Mercantile.

14:15.121 --> 14:17.489
The blueprints crossed my desk
very briefly

14:17.523 --> 14:19.558
but I managed
to commit them to memory.

14:19.591 --> 14:23.795
And if I have
remembered correctly...

14:30.369 --> 14:32.571
Happy birthday, Caroline.

14:39.945 --> 14:41.613
This is a wishing machine.

14:41.647 --> 14:43.549
You tell it your wishes...

14:44.550 --> 14:47.486
and it keeps them safe
until they come true.

14:47.519 --> 14:51.523
Even if you forget them,
they're always there.

14:51.557 --> 14:52.691
Can I tell a wish?

14:52.724 --> 14:55.194
Step right up. Go ahead.

14:55.227 --> 14:58.997
I wish to marry Santa Claus.

14:59.030 --> 15:00.832
That is a good wish.

15:01.933 --> 15:05.704
I wish for ballet slippers.

15:11.777 --> 15:13.779
Hey, that's a good wish, too.

15:14.413 --> 15:16.182
What's your wish, Mommy?

15:17.883 --> 15:19.685
I wish...

15:24.089 --> 15:27.092
for happiness
like this forever

15:27.125 --> 15:28.827
for you and you...

15:30.596 --> 15:32.431
and for your father.

15:32.931 --> 15:34.566
Boring!

15:34.600 --> 15:36.268
Boring?

15:36.302 --> 15:39.571
Since when has happiness
ever been boring?

15:39.605 --> 15:42.641

16:27.286 --> 16:30.789
The goat prices go up,
so the pork bellies go down.

16:32.023 --> 16:34.125
- Charles, we're leaving.
- Huh?

16:34.159 --> 16:35.627
This bank only wants
to lend money

16:35.661 --> 16:36.795
to people with money.

16:41.233 --> 16:43.769
What are you
looking at, flop-doodle?

16:46.037 --> 16:47.939
Mr. Barnum.

16:49.941 --> 16:53.712
This venture you propose
is risky and somewhat bizarre.

16:53.745 --> 16:55.681
It's a good bet
is what it is, sir.

16:55.714 --> 16:57.349
People don't
want to admit it...

16:57.383 --> 17:00.118
but they're fascinated
with the exotic and the macabre.

17:00.151 --> 17:01.787
It's why we stare at it.

17:01.820 --> 17:04.623
The bank is going to need
substantial collateral.

17:05.891 --> 17:09.094
Of course. I, uh,
I wouldn't suggest otherwise.

17:09.127 --> 17:11.195
The deed and title
to my entire flotilla

17:11.229 --> 17:12.431
of trading vessels.

17:15.834 --> 17:18.304
Why would a bank
loan us $10,000?

17:18.337 --> 17:20.638
Because we put up collateral.

17:20.672 --> 17:22.116
But, dear, we don't
have any collateral.

17:22.140 --> 17:23.108
Sure we do.

17:23.141 --> 17:24.376
In the South China Seas.

17:24.410 --> 17:26.077
In the South China Seas?

17:26.111 --> 17:28.314
Deep in the South China Seas.

17:28.347 --> 17:31.517
And what did
we buy with this loan?

17:31.550 --> 17:34.753
"Barnum's American Museum
of Curiosities."

17:34.786 --> 17:36.455
What kind of museum is it?

17:39.190 --> 17:40.592
A place to be transported.

17:40.626 --> 17:42.193
A place where people
can see things

17:42.227 --> 17:43.395
they've never seen before.

17:43.795 --> 17:44.596
Huh?

17:44.630 --> 17:46.698
- Wax figures?
- Yeah. Yeah.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.567
They're all the rage
in Europe. Look.

17:48.600 --> 17:51.202
Marie Antoinette with the
sore throat. Napoleon.

17:51.236 --> 17:53.104
Come here. See?

17:53.138 --> 17:56.007
You've already met some of the
most famous folks in history.

17:56.041 --> 17:57.376
But they're not all wax.

17:57.409 --> 18:00.879
This is the great O'Malley.

18:00.912 --> 18:03.649
Master of sleight of hand.
A king of deception.

18:03.682 --> 18:05.584
You don't look like a magician.

18:06.318 --> 18:07.853
I'm a thief.

18:07.886 --> 18:08.954
A very good thief.

18:08.987 --> 18:11.022
I caught him nicking my watch.

18:11.056 --> 18:12.123
- See?
- An elephant!

18:12.157 --> 18:13.224
Not just any elephant.

18:13.258 --> 18:14.225
I can get you
somethin' real nice.

18:14.259 --> 18:15.226
Just say the word.

18:15.260 --> 18:16.261
Thank you.

18:16.294 --> 18:17.596
Oh, yeah.
This is a ten-ton bull

18:17.629 --> 18:19.598
straight from
the plains of Africa.

18:19.631 --> 18:22.167
And look at that.

18:22.200 --> 18:24.169
The tallest giraffe
in the world.

18:24.202 --> 18:25.671
Can I climb up its leg?

18:25.704 --> 18:28.073
Absolutely not. Okay.

18:28.106 --> 18:31.042
Now, I know how it looks.

18:31.076 --> 18:32.478
If you didn't,
I'd be worried.

18:32.511 --> 18:34.312
I mean, it just
needs a little work, but...

18:34.346 --> 18:35.757
The loan has to be
paid back every month.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.659
Oh, yeah, we're gonna pay it.
We just need customers.

18:37.683 --> 18:39.363
- Hundreds of them.
- We're gonna get them.

18:42.621 --> 18:44.255
Welcome to the Barnum Museum.

18:44.289 --> 18:45.624
It is one hour
of your time, sir,

18:45.657 --> 18:47.158
but it will change your life.

18:47.192 --> 18:48.503
We have shows
on the hour every hour.

18:48.527 --> 18:50.161
I love your dress.

18:50.195 --> 18:51.630
Surely not for
the faint of heart,

18:51.663 --> 18:53.532
but I can tell
you're gonna love it.

18:53.565 --> 18:55.434
Half price for anyone
who's wearing a hat.

18:55.467 --> 18:56.668
Ho, ho! That's you, sir.

18:56.702 --> 18:59.705
Welcome to the Barnum Museum.

19:05.711 --> 19:06.645
Load of garbage.

19:06.678 --> 19:08.246
Goodness, no. It's rubbish.

19:08.279 --> 19:10.324
Welcome to the Barnum Museum,
where everyone's special...

19:10.348 --> 19:12.117
How many tickets?

19:12.150 --> 19:14.420
- Three.
- Three.

19:39.578 --> 19:41.079
Daddy.

19:45.651 --> 19:47.052
Daddy.

19:52.257 --> 19:54.460
Did you sell
any more tickets today?

19:54.493 --> 19:56.595
A few. Yeah.

19:56.628 --> 19:58.864
Most everyone was rushing home,
it's Friday,

19:58.897 --> 20:03.835
but we sold a few.

20:03.869 --> 20:07.939
I think you have too many dead
things in your museum, Daddy.

20:07.973 --> 20:09.340
Do you?

20:09.374 --> 20:12.678
She's right.
You need something alive.

20:15.681 --> 20:17.315
Go to sleep, both of you.

20:17.348 --> 20:19.685
Something sensational.

20:20.318 --> 20:21.887
That's a big word.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.089
It's your word.

20:24.122 --> 20:27.092
Something that isn't stuffed.

20:27.125 --> 20:29.628
- Like a mermaid.
- Or a unicorn.

20:30.996 --> 20:33.298
Unicorns aren't real.

20:33.331 --> 20:35.801
Well, mermaids
aren't real either.

21:02.327 --> 21:04.362
You must be Gertrude Stratton.

21:04.395 --> 21:05.664
I'm looking for your son.

21:06.431 --> 21:07.766
I don't have a son.

21:08.466 --> 21:10.068
The hospital record says you do.

21:10.101 --> 21:12.538
Charles, right? Age 22?

21:17.275 --> 21:18.777
Charles!

21:20.278 --> 21:21.479
Charles!

21:35.326 --> 21:36.895
P.T. Barnum, at your service.

21:38.530 --> 21:40.866
I am putting together a show

21:40.899 --> 21:42.133
and I need a star.

21:43.268 --> 21:45.336
You want people
to laugh at me.

21:45.370 --> 21:46.681
Well, they're laughing
anyway, kid,

21:46.705 --> 21:47.973
so might as well get paid.

21:57.382 --> 21:59.417
I see a soldier,
no, a general

21:59.450 --> 22:02.921
riding across the stage
with a sword and a gun,

22:02.954 --> 22:04.522
and... and...

22:04.556 --> 22:07.058
and the most beautiful uniform
ever made.

22:07.092 --> 22:08.960
People will come
from all over the world,

22:08.994 --> 22:11.963
and when they see him,
they won't laugh.

22:17.168 --> 22:18.837
They'll salute.

22:34.720 --> 22:35.987
How's it looking, girls?

22:42.661 --> 22:44.495
Hey! You looking for freaks?

22:44.529 --> 22:46.331
I know where
you can find one of them.

22:47.532 --> 22:48.734
Really?

22:53.104 --> 22:54.706
Come on, girls.

22:59.044 --> 22:59.911
Hello.

22:59.945 --> 23:01.146
Sir, you shouldn't
be here.

23:01.179 --> 23:03.148
I'm sorry,
who's doing that singing?

23:06.217 --> 23:08.553
It's you, isn't it?

23:08.586 --> 23:10.488
Sir, I'll have
to ask you to leave.

23:10.521 --> 23:12.357
You are so talented, blessed...

23:15.093 --> 23:16.361
Extraordinary.

23:17.629 --> 23:19.230
Unique.

23:20.431 --> 23:22.233
I would even say beautiful.

23:24.502 --> 23:25.871
Sir.

23:26.537 --> 23:28.606
Please leave me alone.

23:35.947 --> 23:37.983
They don't understand,
but they will.

23:52.330 --> 23:53.665
This line is so...

23:53.699 --> 23:57.368
Oh, my God! Oh, goodness.

23:57.402 --> 24:01.807
Okay. Anne and W.D. Wheeler.
Brother and sister?

24:01.840 --> 24:04.542
- Yes, sir.
- Terrific. And what do you do?

24:04.575 --> 24:05.677
Trapeze.

24:05.711 --> 24:08.046
Trapeze. Okay.

24:08.079 --> 24:09.647
You know, people
aren't gonna like it

24:09.681 --> 24:11.182
if you put us on the stage.

24:11.216 --> 24:13.318
Oh, I'm counting on it.

24:14.853 --> 24:17.655
Is this over your...

24:17.689 --> 24:18.890
Entire body.

24:18.924 --> 24:20.726
Terrific.
I don't need to see it.

24:24.262 --> 24:27.766
Now. Yes!

24:29.868 --> 24:31.502
Can I just ask
how heavy you are?

24:31.536 --> 24:33.071
Do you have a number for that?

24:33.104 --> 24:36.307
- I prefer not to say, but...
- Just between you and me.

24:36.341 --> 24:38.777
500 pounds.

24:38.810 --> 24:42.948
- 750 pounds, you said?
- 750 pounds, it is!

24:52.457 --> 24:54.225
What is your name?

24:54.259 --> 24:56.728
Vasily Palvos, sir.

24:56.762 --> 24:58.329
Yeah, we're gonna
change that name.

24:58.363 --> 25:00.866
Uh, I think you're Irish.

25:02.533 --> 25:04.202
We have a show!

25:05.837 --> 25:08.306
That's good,
but I need it five times bigger!

25:08.339 --> 25:09.507
And I want it everywhere!

25:09.540 --> 25:11.109
Carriages,
sides of trains,

25:11.142 --> 25:14.645
trolleys, crates, milk bottles,
everywhere they look!

25:14.679 --> 25:17.348
Barnum's American Museum.

25:20.518 --> 25:22.053
Nice to see you, sir.

28:24.669 --> 28:27.072
"Criminal." "Degrading."

28:27.105 --> 28:28.606
"A circus."
I like "circus."

28:28.639 --> 28:30.375
That's right, fat boy!

28:32.243 --> 28:34.445
You gonna protect
that bearded lady?

28:34.479 --> 28:35.480
Hey!

28:37.148 --> 28:38.649
- Hey! That's enough!
- Freak!

28:39.250 --> 28:40.718
Walter!

28:40.751 --> 28:42.020
Inside, all of you. Right now.

28:42.053 --> 28:43.354
Look at 'em run!

28:43.388 --> 28:45.923
- We don't want your kind!
- Get outta here!

28:45.957 --> 28:48.960
That's right, you freaks!
Your master's calling!

28:48.994 --> 28:50.428
That's quite enough, sir.

28:54.599 --> 28:56.267
Nothing more to look at!

28:57.435 --> 29:00.038
At your service!

30:50.215 --> 30:52.383
One for me, one for the lady.

30:52.417 --> 30:54.119
O'Malley.

30:57.988 --> 31:00.725
Ah, Mr. Bennett
from the Herald.

31:00.758 --> 31:02.827
Come to take in
another show, huh?

31:02.860 --> 31:04.028
Tell me, Mr. Barnum,

31:04.061 --> 31:05.196
does it bother you

31:05.230 --> 31:08.133
that everything
you're selling is fake?

31:08.833 --> 31:10.468
Do these smiles seem fake?

31:10.501 --> 31:11.745
It doesn't matter
where they come from.

31:11.769 --> 31:12.970
The joy is real.

31:13.003 --> 31:14.539
So, you are a philanthropist?

31:14.572 --> 31:17.275
Well, hyperbole
isn't the worst crime.

31:17.308 --> 31:20.278
Men suffer more from imagining
too little than too much.

31:20.311 --> 31:22.747
The creed of a true fraud.

31:24.081 --> 31:26.284
Mr. Bennett, when was
the last time you smiled

31:26.317 --> 31:28.719
or had a good laugh?
Like a real laugh?

31:30.188 --> 31:33.258
A theater critic who can't
find joy in the theater.

31:33.291 --> 31:35.526
Now who's a fraud?

31:37.895 --> 31:40.030
Oh, Mr. Bennett.

31:40.064 --> 31:42.833
That word you used
to describe my show?

31:43.901 --> 31:45.102
Has a nice ring to it.

31:55.180 --> 31:56.914
And right this way.

31:56.947 --> 32:00.117
Don't you think there's enough
blind trust in my life?

32:00.151 --> 32:01.819
Well, isn't that
what makes it fun?

32:01.852 --> 32:05.790
Keep coming. Okay.
Are you ready?

32:12.230 --> 32:13.831
- Is it?
- It is.

32:16.901 --> 32:19.136
Come on. Let's go.

32:19.437 --> 32:20.671
Push.

32:22.807 --> 32:23.808
Wow.

32:25.776 --> 32:27.478
Helen, that's for you.

32:30.215 --> 32:33.818
And Caroline,
this is for you.

32:41.192 --> 32:43.060
There's a ballet school
right down the street.

32:43.093 --> 32:45.663
Just past your
parents' house, actually.

32:47.398 --> 32:48.833
Don't tell me
you bought this house

32:48.866 --> 32:51.202
just to rub my parents' noses
in your success?

32:51.236 --> 32:53.438
Well, that wasn't
the only reason.

32:54.905 --> 32:57.242
This is the life I promised you.

32:57.942 --> 32:59.377
Shall we?

32:59.410 --> 33:02.880
Phin, it's beautiful,

33:02.913 --> 33:04.725
but you know, we don't
need all of this to be...

33:04.749 --> 33:06.183
It only took me 25 years,

33:06.217 --> 33:09.153
but welcome home,
Charity Barnum.

33:47.792 --> 33:49.994
- Hello, there.
- There goes Barnum.

33:57.368 --> 34:00.070
Hey, sweetheart,
who's that young man over there?

34:00.104 --> 34:01.872
Oh, that's Phillip Carlyle.

34:01.906 --> 34:04.309
A bit of a scandal, they say.

34:04.342 --> 34:05.910
His last play
was a hit in London.

34:05.943 --> 34:07.512
Play? You pay good money

34:07.545 --> 34:10.080
to watch people stand around
and talk for two hours

34:10.114 --> 34:11.549
and they call me a con man.

34:11.581 --> 34:14.918
Ew, what's that smell?
Do you smell that?

34:14.952 --> 34:17.154
Ew. Something does smell.

34:17.187 --> 34:20.024
Oh, I know what it is.
Peanuts.

34:29.766 --> 34:31.302
I can see it right now.

34:31.335 --> 34:32.637
"Youngest prima ballerina

34:32.670 --> 34:34.539
in the history
of the City Ballet."

34:36.239 --> 34:37.442
I'm quitting.

34:37.475 --> 34:39.344
What? Why would you quit?

34:39.377 --> 34:41.779
I started too late.
I'll never catch up.

34:41.812 --> 34:43.947
Caroline, you were the best
dancer on that stage.

34:45.583 --> 34:48.319
What? You think
I can't spot talent?

34:48.353 --> 34:50.987
Ballet takes years
of hard work.

34:51.021 --> 34:52.389
It's not like the circus.

34:54.091 --> 34:55.360
You can't just fake it.

34:59.897 --> 35:01.131
She can't quit. No.

35:01.165 --> 35:02.400
No, I mean, she just...

35:02.433 --> 35:04.244
She just feels out of place
with the other girls.

35:04.268 --> 35:05.770
Well, I should
certainly hope so.

35:05.803 --> 35:08.105
I've never seen so many
little prima donnas in my life.

35:08.138 --> 35:10.351
Yeah, but those prima donnas
are the most important thing

35:10.375 --> 35:11.676
in the world to her right now.

35:11.709 --> 35:14.078
She'll learn to ignore them
just like I did.

35:14.111 --> 35:15.513
She shouldn't have to.

35:15.546 --> 35:17.515
New York society
will never accept us.

35:17.548 --> 35:19.350
If they did,
they'd have to stop judging

35:19.384 --> 35:21.218
and actually do something
with their lives.

35:21.251 --> 35:22.620
This isn't about me.

35:23.754 --> 35:28.393
Oh. So it's different
than everything else then?

35:28.426 --> 35:31.061
I just want her to be proud
of who she is, of her family.

35:31.095 --> 35:33.163
She is proud.

35:33.197 --> 35:34.799
We don't have
to be the Carlyles.

35:40.438 --> 35:42.473
Mr. Carlyle.
You produced this play?

35:42.507 --> 35:44.642
Yes, I did indeed.

35:44.675 --> 35:46.877
Refunds are available
at the front box office.

35:46.911 --> 35:48.679
P.T. Barnum.

35:48.713 --> 35:49.614
From the circus?

35:49.647 --> 35:51.616
Yes. You... you've been?

35:51.649 --> 35:55.085
God, no. But I have
seen the crowds.

35:55.119 --> 35:57.731
People leave your shows a great deal
happier than when they came in.

35:57.755 --> 36:00.391
Which is much more
than I can say for my play.

36:00.425 --> 36:02.660
And yet, you have
no trouble selling tickets.

36:04.328 --> 36:06.063
That's because
I'm selling virtue.

36:08.365 --> 36:09.700
Can I buy you a drink?

36:11.769 --> 36:14.071
I wanna go after
the carriage trade.

36:14.104 --> 36:16.173
Present legitimate acts,

36:16.206 --> 36:19.544
expand our appeal,
go after the snobs.

36:19.577 --> 36:21.912
If you only knew
how suffocating they are.

36:21.946 --> 36:23.380
So come join the circus.

36:23.414 --> 36:25.094
You clearly have a flair
for show business.

36:26.551 --> 36:28.385
Teach me how to appeal
to the highbrows.

36:29.454 --> 36:31.589
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.

36:31.622 --> 36:33.991
Mr. Barnum, I can't just run off
and join the circus.

36:34.024 --> 36:35.993
Why not?
Sounds thrilling, doesn't it?

36:36.026 --> 36:37.971
Let's just say that I find it
much more comfortable

36:37.995 --> 36:39.764
admiring your show from afar.

36:39.797 --> 36:41.432
Comfort, the enemy of progress.

36:41.466 --> 36:43.243
Do you understand that
just associating with you

36:43.267 --> 36:44.869
could cost me my inheritance?

36:44.902 --> 36:46.637
Oh, it could cost you
more than that.

36:46.671 --> 36:48.238
You'd be risking everything.

36:48.272 --> 36:50.007
But, on the other hand, well,

36:50.040 --> 36:53.110

find yourself a free man.

Who is that?

41:00.190 --> 41:04.294
Hey, hey! No one's buying hats
back here. Get out front, go!

41:04.328 --> 41:05.930
W.D., Anne, I wanna introduce

41:05.963 --> 41:08.065
my newest hire,
Mr. Phillip Carlyle.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.736
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Yeah, pleasure.

41:13.037 --> 41:15.072
And what is your act,
Mr. Carlyle?

41:15.773 --> 41:17.674
I don't have an act.

41:18.976 --> 41:20.745
Everyone's got an act.

41:26.483 --> 41:27.584
Mr. Barnum!

41:27.617 --> 41:28.986
Yeah.

41:30.220 --> 41:31.355
You better come see this.

41:32.890 --> 41:34.424
Phillip, keep up!

41:38.262 --> 41:40.564
A bit of a nasty element.

41:40.597 --> 41:41.999
There always is, isn't there?

41:43.133 --> 41:44.902
Nothing draws a crowd
quite like a crowd.

41:44.935 --> 41:46.336
We don't want you in our city!

41:46.370 --> 41:48.272
Go home, you freaks!

41:49.106 --> 41:49.874
Freaks!

41:49.907 --> 41:51.341
"Shame of the city."

41:51.375 --> 41:53.878
"The protests cement
Mr. Barnum's reputation

41:53.911 --> 41:56.781
as a purveyor of the offensive
and indecent."

41:56.814 --> 42:00.650
"Offensive and indecent."
Mr. Bennett, I am blushing.

42:00.684 --> 42:03.553
No, I'm blushing.

42:03.587 --> 42:05.255
What do you care
what Bennett thinks?

42:05.289 --> 42:07.191
- He's a prig.
- And a snob.

42:07.224 --> 42:09.359
Yeah, and all the snobs
in New York read him.

42:09.393 --> 42:10.795
He does their thinking for them.

42:10.828 --> 42:13.263
Whatever happened to
thriving off controversy?

42:13.297 --> 42:15.132
Yeah, well...
Hey.

42:15.165 --> 42:17.010
- Do you have any thoughts on this?
- Phillip!

42:17.034 --> 42:19.336
You know what?
As a matter of fact, I do.

42:19.369 --> 42:20.604
Helen, come on.

42:20.637 --> 42:21.906
"The Master of the Household

42:21.939 --> 42:23.808
"has it in command
of the Queen

42:23.841 --> 42:25.776
"to invite
Mr. Phineas T. Barnum

42:25.810 --> 42:27.111
"and his theatrical troupe

42:27.144 --> 42:30.680
to a reception
at Buckingham Palace."

42:30.714 --> 42:33.984
The Queen Victoria?
Is this real?

42:34.018 --> 42:35.953
I had to pull a few strings.

42:35.986 --> 42:38.222
If you want society
to accept you,

42:38.255 --> 42:39.523
you may as well start...

42:39.556 --> 42:42.326
at the very, very top.

42:43.327 --> 42:44.962
Are we all invited?

42:53.670 --> 42:55.081
I guess I'll just
have to tell the Queen

42:55.105 --> 42:57.041
that either all of us go...

42:57.842 --> 42:59.476
or none of us will.

43:04.314 --> 43:07.284
The Queen of England!
Can't get much better than that.

43:15.592 --> 43:16.832
Why aren't we in tails?

43:16.861 --> 43:17.971
We're the entertainment.

43:17.995 --> 43:20.164
Don't see you in a costume.

43:24.034 --> 43:26.871
Your Majesty,
Mr. Phineas T. Barnum...

43:26.904 --> 43:31.808
and his Oddities from America!

43:35.612 --> 43:37.381
Is that real?

43:50.227 --> 43:54.932
Your Majesty.
May I present Mr. Barnum.

43:54.965 --> 43:57.367
The honor is mine, Mr. Barnum.

43:58.135 --> 43:59.469
And I've heard all about

43:59.503 --> 44:02.506
your little colonel from
my friends in America.

44:03.307 --> 44:05.009
General, ma'am.

44:05.042 --> 44:06.843
You're even smaller
than I imagined.

44:06.877 --> 44:08.212
Well, you're not exactly

44:08.245 --> 44:10.247
reaching the top shelf
yourself, sweetheart.

44:32.802 --> 44:34.071
That went well.

44:35.973 --> 44:37.707
Your Majesty.

44:37.741 --> 44:39.043
Phillip.

44:39.443 --> 44:41.145
Miss Jenny Lind.

44:44.581 --> 44:47.184
She is luminous.

44:49.219 --> 44:50.955
Who's that?

44:50.988 --> 44:52.889
The opera singer?

44:53.557 --> 44:54.891
Singer, huh?

44:56.026 --> 44:59.063
She's the most famous performer
in all of Europe.

44:59.096 --> 45:01.765
She's sold out
La Scala a dozen times.

45:01.798 --> 45:04.334
Not to mention
the French Opera.

45:08.638 --> 45:09.906
Ah.

45:10.740 --> 45:12.009
What are you doing?

45:12.042 --> 45:14.054
Following you, so you can
introduce me to Miss Lind.

45:14.078 --> 45:16.046
- Introduce you? I don't know her.
- Yeah.

45:16.080 --> 45:17.523
Everybody knows her.
You just said so yourself.

45:17.547 --> 45:19.392
Yeah, exactly. You don't just
march up to someone like this.

45:19.416 --> 45:21.151
Why not? We're personable.
She's a person.

45:24.688 --> 45:26.090
Miss Lind.

45:26.790 --> 45:28.525
My name is Phillip Carlyle.

45:30.494 --> 45:33.463
And this extraordinary gentleman
next to me...

45:33.497 --> 45:34.965
Phineas Taylor Barnum.

45:34.999 --> 45:36.100
The pleasure's mine.

45:36.133 --> 45:37.401
Of course,
you are the American.

45:37.434 --> 45:40.170
I believe I might
have heard of you.

45:40.204 --> 45:42.672
Oh, well, if you've heard of me
all the way over here

45:42.706 --> 45:44.741
I must be doing something right.

45:44.774 --> 45:47.111
That, or something very wrong.

45:47.144 --> 45:50.014
Well, in the world of publicity,
there's hardly a difference.

45:50.047 --> 45:53.250
I believe those are the words
of a scoundrel, Mr. Barnum.

45:53.283 --> 45:56.086
A showman, Miss Lind,
just a showman.

45:56.120 --> 45:58.355
The best on my side
of the Atlantic.

45:58.388 --> 46:00.790
Well, if you do
say so yourself.

46:00.824 --> 46:04.028
I do, but I don't have to.

46:04.061 --> 46:05.095
- Oh, no. No.
- Right?

46:05.129 --> 46:07.097
No, he is one of the best.

46:07.131 --> 46:09.133
Oh, that's very kind of you.
Miss Lind...

46:09.166 --> 46:10.300
let me get to the point.

46:10.334 --> 46:11.735
I'd like to bring you
to New York.

46:11.768 --> 46:14.071
And if you agree, I'll make you
the most famous singer

46:14.104 --> 46:16.273
not in Europe,
but in the entire world.

46:16.306 --> 46:17.907
Mmm.

46:17.941 --> 46:20.110
And have you heard me sing?

46:20.144 --> 46:22.979
Absolutely.
No. No, I haven't.

46:23.013 --> 46:25.782
But like mine,
your reputation precedes you,

46:25.815 --> 46:27.717
and, well,
I trust your reputation

46:27.751 --> 46:29.753
more than my own taste, so...

46:29.786 --> 46:32.456
I've never been to America.

46:32.489 --> 46:34.191
You will sing
in the grandest theater

46:34.224 --> 46:36.926
with the finest orchestra
in the greatest city on Earth.

46:36.960 --> 46:38.562
"Jenny Lind.

46:38.595 --> 46:39.863
"One night only."

46:39.896 --> 46:41.098
Or maybe two.

46:41.131 --> 46:43.533
And at 20 percent of the gate,

46:43.567 --> 46:45.335
it'll be a queen's ransom
for your efforts.

46:45.369 --> 46:47.704
I give most of my earnings
to charity, Mr. Barnum.

46:47.737 --> 46:48.972
To orphans and widows.

46:49.005 --> 46:51.608
"Voice of a Nightingale,
Heart of an Angel."

46:51.641 --> 46:52.642
That's brilliant.

46:52.676 --> 46:54.154
I mean, the press
will go crazy for that story.

46:54.178 --> 46:55.745
That's not a story.

46:55.779 --> 46:57.747
May I ask you something,
Mr. Barnum?

46:57.781 --> 46:59.216
Anything.

47:00.550 --> 47:01.585
Why me?

47:04.188 --> 47:05.422
People come to my show

47:05.455 --> 47:08.392
for the pleasure
of being hoodwinked.

47:08.425 --> 47:10.794
Just once, I'd love to give them
something real.

47:17.201 --> 47:18.735
Miss Lind.

47:30.814 --> 47:33.617
Everyone is here.
Look at this.

47:33.650 --> 47:35.252
Even the Winthrops.

47:35.685 --> 47:37.354
Are you happy?

47:37.987 --> 47:40.190
I will be if this works.

47:40.224 --> 47:43.093
Oh, God. I hope she can sing.

47:44.994 --> 47:46.172
What's taking her so long?

47:46.196 --> 47:47.897
They're still
taking their seats.

47:47.931 --> 47:49.199
Speaking of which.
Yeah?

47:49.233 --> 47:51.010
Tom and Lettie, the others,
they've just arrived.

47:51.034 --> 47:52.236
What?

47:52.269 --> 47:54.271
Where should I put 'em?
Your box?

47:54.304 --> 47:56.573
That box? No, no, no,
that's a bit visible.

47:56.606 --> 47:57.707
Visible?

47:57.741 --> 47:59.252
The acoustics are actually
better in the standing room.

47:59.276 --> 48:00.477
That's where they should be.

48:01.878 --> 48:03.046
Miss Lind's ready now.

48:03.079 --> 48:04.548
Okay. Thank you, thank God!

48:06.550 --> 48:08.152
This is so awesome.

48:08.185 --> 48:10.420
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Yeah.

48:10.454 --> 48:12.356
- I love it.
- Look at the curtain.

48:25.702 --> 48:28.205
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your patience.

48:28.238 --> 48:30.006
He's out of his element.

48:30.039 --> 48:31.741
What is this about?

48:31.775 --> 48:33.310
Is that Barnum?

48:33.343 --> 48:34.711
This isn't the circus.

48:35.679 --> 48:37.481
I recently had the privilege

48:37.514 --> 48:41.218
of hearing the most
divine voice

48:41.251 --> 48:42.352
I've ever heard.

48:42.386 --> 48:44.221
Suddenly,
he's a connoisseur.

48:44.254 --> 48:47.524
Now, I know that
sounds like Barnum Humbug...

48:47.557 --> 48:49.659
but I have 100 bottles
of good champagne on ice

48:49.693 --> 48:52.196
that says this isn't just
another sideshow novelty.

48:55.064 --> 48:56.700
May I present...

48:56.733 --> 48:58.502
the Swedish Nightingale...

Bravissima!

52:59.208 --> 53:00.544
More!

53:01.177 --> 53:02.177
Excellent!

53:04.481 --> 53:05.549
Brava!

53:07.651 --> 53:08.651
Encore!

53:12.722 --> 53:14.562
Jenny, this is my wife,
Charity, and our girls.

53:14.591 --> 53:16.626
Of course, and I've heard
so much about you!

53:16.660 --> 53:19.463
And your father tells me
you're a fan of the ballet.

53:19.496 --> 53:21.230
Yes, I'm studying ballet.

53:21.264 --> 53:22.799
Are you?

53:22.832 --> 53:25.401
- Of course, I am.
- And, of course, she is.

53:25.435 --> 53:26.536
And what
about you, Helen?

53:26.570 --> 53:28.171
You look like
a princess, ma'am.

53:29.372 --> 53:33.810
I have to admit, Barnum...
she is remarkable.

53:33.843 --> 53:36.546
Enough to bring joy to the most
joyless critic, isn't she?

53:36.580 --> 53:39.883
Mmm. And in the hands of a
real purveyor of the arts,

53:39.916 --> 53:43.219
she could be something in this country.

53:43.252 --> 53:45.321
Shame,
she's fallen in with you.

53:45.354 --> 53:47.290
You really are better
on the page, Mr. Bennett,

53:47.323 --> 53:48.692
hard as that is to believe.

53:48.725 --> 53:50.159
- Mr. Barnum...
- Yes.

53:50.193 --> 53:51.704
- I'd love to meet Miss Lind.
- And you will meet Miss Lind.

53:51.728 --> 53:53.539
- Would you introduce us?
- If you just give me a moment...

53:53.563 --> 53:55.231
- Phineas.
- Yes.

53:55.264 --> 53:56.800
You've...

53:56.833 --> 53:58.635
done well.

54:00.203 --> 54:01.638
Thank you.

54:04.608 --> 54:06.510
Allow me to introduce you.

54:08.311 --> 54:10.614
Uh, excuse me, Jenny.

54:10.647 --> 54:13.316
I'd like you to meet
Charity's parents.

54:13.349 --> 54:14.784
Mr. and Mrs. Hallett.

54:14.818 --> 54:16.019
Ah, pleasure.

54:16.052 --> 54:18.130
- How do you do? Very nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

54:18.154 --> 54:20.456
- Mother.
- Hello, dear.

54:20.490 --> 54:23.259
Are these...

54:23.292 --> 54:24.994
Yes, those are
your granddaughters.

54:25.028 --> 54:26.162
Phineas, not here.

54:26.195 --> 54:27.163
Not here?

54:27.196 --> 54:28.708
You afraid I'm gonna
embarrass your parents

54:28.732 --> 54:30.734
in front of their fancy friends?

54:30.767 --> 54:32.502
I really don't think
I have that power.

54:32.536 --> 54:34.804
An insignificant man like me

54:34.838 --> 54:38.975
who was clearly destined
to lead an insignificant life.

54:39.008 --> 54:42.211
All that fortune,
and still just the tailor's boy.

54:43.246 --> 54:44.681
Get out.

54:49.118 --> 54:51.821
Well, Phineas...

54:51.855 --> 54:54.591
I believe I told you
that free champagne

54:54.624 --> 54:56.159
is a recipe for disaster.

54:57.060 --> 54:58.194
Charity.

54:58.227 --> 55:02.198
Now would everyone please
raise their glasses? Charity.

55:02.231 --> 55:03.533
To Mr. Barnum...

55:03.567 --> 55:05.334
who has shown
once and for all...

55:05.368 --> 55:08.137
that a man's station
is limited only

55:08.171 --> 55:09.773
by his imagination.

55:11.608 --> 55:14.043
- To Barnum! To Barnum!
- Thank you.

55:14.077 --> 55:15.077
To Mr. Barnum.

55:18.447 --> 55:20.483
Thank you.

55:20.516 --> 55:23.119
It's hard to understand
wealth and privilege

55:23.152 --> 55:25.121
when you're born into it.

55:26.956 --> 55:30.259
I sometimes don't feel
like I belong here.

55:31.394 --> 55:32.962
You?

55:34.130 --> 55:36.766
I was born out of wedlock...

55:36.800 --> 55:39.068
and that brought
shame upon my family.

55:39.936 --> 55:41.871
And life always
manages to remind me

55:41.905 --> 55:43.282
that I don't deserve
a place in this world.

55:43.306 --> 55:47.944
And that leaves a hole that
no ovation can ever fill.

55:53.883 --> 55:55.184
- Mr. Phineas!
- Guys...

55:55.218 --> 55:56.953
Lord, that lady can sing!

55:56.986 --> 55:57.854
I know.

55:57.887 --> 55:59.889
Think she likes a man
in uniform?

55:59.923 --> 56:01.634
I'm sure she does.
Okay, what are you doing here?

56:01.658 --> 56:03.192
You got a show
in an hour, okay?

56:03.226 --> 56:05.237
That's enough time for us to have
at least three drinks, right?

56:05.261 --> 56:06.395
Come on, let's go.

56:06.429 --> 56:07.931
- No, no, no. Lettie!
- What?

56:07.964 --> 56:10.767
It's very crowded in here, okay?
And I can't have you mingling...

56:10.800 --> 56:11.635
Guys!

56:11.668 --> 56:12.802
Who's gonna pay admission

56:12.836 --> 56:14.279
if you're out there
for all the world to see?

56:14.303 --> 56:16.405
- Okay? Have a great show.
- Wait.

56:16.439 --> 56:18.374
Ladies and gentlemen, a toast!

56:18.407 --> 56:21.310
Jenny, America
may not know it yet...

56:21.344 --> 56:23.312
but they are going to love you.

Why can't you just put

Why do you need
to tour the country?

01:00:16.045 --> 01:00:18.514
Why did Napoleon
march on Russia?

01:00:18.547 --> 01:00:19.715
Napoleon was defeated.

01:00:19.748 --> 01:00:21.951
Napoleon didn't have
a 60-piece orchestra.

01:00:21.985 --> 01:00:23.419
A 60-piece orchestra?

01:00:23.452 --> 01:00:25.922
Just get the cheapest musicians
you can and watch that.

01:00:25.955 --> 01:00:27.166
We'll still have to board them.

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:28.400
We'll get married ones,
they can share a bunk.

01:00:28.424 --> 01:00:30.526
O'Malley, that's
Caroline's piggy bank.

01:00:30.559 --> 01:00:33.396
- Custom sets? Fireworks?
- Yeah.

01:00:33.429 --> 01:00:34.830
Inside theaters?

01:00:34.864 --> 01:00:36.165
That's genius.

01:00:36.199 --> 01:00:37.466
No. Hey, P.T...

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.344
These are the most
famous theaters in the country.

01:00:39.368 --> 01:00:41.346
They make you buy the seats
in advance just to book them.

01:00:41.370 --> 01:00:42.738
Yeah. I took out a loan.

01:00:42.771 --> 01:00:45.317
- And we have to pay Jenny in advance?
- It was a large loan. Okay?

01:00:45.341 --> 01:00:46.910
You're not gonna see
a penny of profit

01:00:46.943 --> 01:00:48.411
until your 40th show...

01:00:48.444 --> 01:00:49.578
41st, actually.

01:00:49.612 --> 01:00:51.123
You're risking everything
you've built here.

01:00:51.147 --> 01:00:52.448
How do you think I built it?

01:00:52.481 --> 01:00:54.326
We'll have plenty of profits
to go around after this.

01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:55.284
- P.T.?
- What?

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:57.620
Your attention has been
divided long enough.

01:00:57.653 --> 01:00:58.754
Our gate is down,

01:00:58.787 --> 01:01:00.156
we have more
protesters every day.

01:01:00.189 --> 01:01:01.566
You just need to get people
to come back.

01:01:01.590 --> 01:01:03.626
"If you haven't been
to the Barnum Museum lately,

01:01:03.659 --> 01:01:05.037
you haven't been
at the Barnum Museum."

01:01:05.061 --> 01:01:07.030
They come to see you.

01:01:07.063 --> 01:01:08.764
Your crazy ideas...

01:01:08.797 --> 01:01:11.034
your new acts, the unusual.

01:01:11.067 --> 01:01:13.869
Then how about you show
them a smile? That'd be unusual.

01:01:13.903 --> 01:01:15.247
Keep rehearsing.
Just make it very clear

01:01:15.271 --> 01:01:17.806
I expect them to afford you
all the deference you deserve

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:20.843
and that they should
be nice to you anyway.

01:01:20.876 --> 01:01:23.112
Ain't that a sight
for sore eyes?

01:01:23.146 --> 01:01:24.680
He couldn't even say "hello."

01:01:24.713 --> 01:01:25.814
Or "goodbye."

01:01:25.848 --> 01:01:28.217
He's going on tour. Sorry, guys.

01:01:28.251 --> 01:01:29.986
Oh, pull yourself
together, Carlyle.

01:01:30.019 --> 01:01:31.955
Don't you have
somewhere to be?

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:38.727
Anne Wheeler.

01:01:38.761 --> 01:01:41.497
Mr. Barnum said
he left a ticket for me.

01:01:45.768 --> 01:01:47.170
I'm sorry.

01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:49.005
I believe there's only
supposed to be one.

01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:51.440
No, there's meant to be two.

01:01:56.279 --> 01:01:59.015
I wasn't sure
you'd come if I asked.

01:02:03.052 --> 01:02:04.653
Five minutes to curtain.

01:02:07.423 --> 01:02:09.358
I've always wanted
to go to the theater.

01:02:15.999 --> 01:02:18.101
Phillip, is that you?

01:02:19.268 --> 01:02:20.269
Mother.

01:02:20.303 --> 01:02:24.440
Father.
This is Anne Wheeler.

01:02:25.241 --> 01:02:28.444
Phillip, have you no shame?

01:02:28.477 --> 01:02:32.215
Associating yourself with that
Barnum business is one thing...

01:02:32.248 --> 01:02:34.417
but parading around
with the help?

01:02:37.386 --> 01:02:39.255
Anne.

01:02:39.288 --> 01:02:40.623
Anne!

01:02:40.656 --> 01:02:41.957
Anne!

01:02:47.096 --> 01:02:49.265
How dare you speak
to her like that?

01:02:51.734 --> 01:02:53.769
You forget your place, Phillip.

01:02:53.802 --> 01:02:55.804
My place?

01:02:55.838 --> 01:02:57.840
Mother, if this is my place,

01:02:57.873 --> 01:03:00.043
then I don't
want any part of it.

01:03:09.585 --> 01:03:11.220

01:19:19.054 --> 01:19:21.189
Thomas, help me break this up.

01:19:34.169 --> 01:19:36.971
If you've come to gloat,
I wouldn't.

01:19:41.109 --> 01:19:44.146
They caught the thugs
who started the fire.

01:19:44.179 --> 01:19:46.681
I thought you'd like to know.

01:19:56.824 --> 01:19:59.894
I never liked your show.

01:19:59.927 --> 01:20:01.763
But I always thought
the people did.

01:20:02.597 --> 01:20:04.699
They did. They do.

01:20:12.774 --> 01:20:14.509
Mind you,
I wouldn't call it art.

01:20:15.710 --> 01:20:17.212
Of course not.

01:20:17.245 --> 01:20:18.513
But...

01:20:20.048 --> 01:20:24.018
putting folks of all kinds
on stage with you...

01:20:24.052 --> 01:20:27.955
all colors, shapes, sizes...

01:20:27.989 --> 01:20:30.292
presenting them as equals...

01:20:31.459 --> 01:20:34.962
Why, another critic
might have even called it

01:20:34.996 --> 01:20:37.332
"a celebration of humanity."

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.702
I would've liked that.

01:20:40.735 --> 01:20:42.304
Mmm.

01:20:45.107 --> 01:20:47.309
Well, I hope you'll rebuild.
Hmm.

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:50.345
I mean, thank God
for Jenny's tour.

01:20:50.378 --> 01:20:52.347
We can borrow off the profits,
we'll be fine.

01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:53.881
You don't know?

01:20:53.915 --> 01:20:55.417
Hmm?

01:21:02.924 --> 01:21:04.526
I'm sorry.

01:21:15.637 --> 01:21:16.904
Charity?

01:21:16.938 --> 01:21:18.540
Oh, God, Charity.

01:21:18.573 --> 01:21:19.974
I don't wanna talk to you.
I am...

01:21:20.007 --> 01:21:21.209
Nothing happened.

01:21:21.243 --> 01:21:22.453
- This is ridiculous.
- Oh, sure. Nothing happened.

01:21:22.477 --> 01:21:24.021
It's on the cover
of every paper in New York.

01:21:24.045 --> 01:21:26.581
Because she orchestrated the photo.
I'm not in love with her!

01:21:26.614 --> 01:21:28.116
Of course you're not.

01:21:28.150 --> 01:21:30.552
Not with her, not with me,
not with anyone.

01:21:30.585 --> 01:21:31.853
Just you and your show.

01:21:34.256 --> 01:21:36.258

01:21:37.692 --> 01:21:39.527
I'm going home.

01:21:39.561 --> 01:21:40.828
This is your home.

01:21:44.799 --> 01:21:46.168
The bank...

01:21:47.969 --> 01:21:49.571
they're evicting us.

01:21:51.306 --> 01:21:53.741
Why didn't you ask me before...

01:21:55.943 --> 01:21:58.180
I would've said yes.

01:21:58.213 --> 01:22:01.649
I never minded the risk,
but we always did it together.

01:22:40.021 --> 01:22:42.023
Figured you'd end up here.

01:22:42.056 --> 01:22:43.791
Feeling sorry for yourself.

01:23:00.174 --> 01:23:01.809
Folks, if you've
come to get paid,

01:23:01.843 --> 01:23:04.412
the money is gone. All of it.

01:23:04.446 --> 01:23:06.314
- Nothing left to give you.
- Shut up, Barnum.

01:23:06.348 --> 01:23:08.283
You just don't get it.

01:23:09.284 --> 01:23:12.320
Our own mothers
were ashamed of us.

01:23:13.421 --> 01:23:14.956
Hid us our whole lives.

01:23:16.291 --> 01:23:19.361
Then you pull us
out of the shadows.

01:23:19.394 --> 01:23:21.363
And now you're
giving up on us, too.

01:23:22.697 --> 01:23:24.599
Maybe you are a fraud.

01:23:24.632 --> 01:23:27.469
Maybe it was just
about making a buck.

01:23:29.571 --> 01:23:32.674
But you gave us a real family.

01:23:32.707 --> 01:23:36.278
And the circus...
that was our home.

01:23:39.981 --> 01:23:41.716

when I first met you...

01:31:16.603 --> 01:31:18.740
I had an inheritance, acclaim,

01:31:18.773 --> 01:31:21.709

to every party in town.
