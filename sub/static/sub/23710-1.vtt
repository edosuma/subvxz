that much to you.

I don't know. Maybe you should go
ask your friend, Mrs. Robinson.

we're just friends.

The time for talking to me
was yesterday.

01:16:41.639 --> 01:16:44.097
But instead, you decided
to go get drunk

01:16:44.266 --> 01:16:47.759
with the woman who taught you how
to fuck when you were a child.

01:16:47.937 --> 01:16:49.394
The going gets rough,

01:16:49.897 --> 01:16:52.105
and you go running to her.

01:16:54.443 --> 01:16:56.150

better than that.

01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:57.777

No. What do you think,
I'd cheat on you?

01:17:12.253 --> 01:17:13.369
You did.

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:16.500
You confided in her
about our private life.

01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:18.707
You chose her over me.

01:17:20.344 --> 01:17:22.427
And then you came home

01:17:22.596 --> 01:17:25.464
and you said that I would
choose this baby over you.

01:17:27.726 --> 01:17:30.184
And you know what?
If I have to, I will.

01:17:31.188 --> 01:17:36.479
I will choose this baby over anybody
because that is what decent parents do.

01:17:37.862 --> 01:17:39.478
It's what your mother
should have done for you.

01:17:39.613 --> 01:17:43.527
And I'm so sorry that she didn't,
Christian, I am sorry.

01:17:44.702 --> 01:17:47.445
But you are not
a kid anymore, Christian.

01:17:47.913 --> 01:17:50.246

the fuck up.

I am not ecstatic either,
given the timing and your reaction.

But babies happen
when you have sex,

01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:15.681
and you and I
tend to do a lot of that.

01:18:17.151 --> 01:18:19.768
So, we can either
do this together,

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:23.363
or I will do it
without you.

You left me.

You left me when I needed you.
You fucked up.
