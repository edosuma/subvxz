The lie is love.

20:05.520 --> 20:07.124
Wait just a minute!

20:07.200 --> 20:08.565
Love the lie.

20:08.720 --> 20:11.200
The way I was raised, by Mom,

20:11.280 --> 20:14.682
I learned the truth
can't be swept
under the rug.

20:14.760 --> 20:16.762
That's a very
noble sentiment, Lisa.

20:16.840 --> 20:19.047
But for once in your life,
can't you just be cool?

20:19.120 --> 20:20.849
Yeah.
Be cool like us.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.729
Coolee. Coolee cool.

20:22.800 --> 20:24.848
Come on, fool.
Be coolee coolee cool.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.331
(CREAKING)
(GRUNTS)

20:26.640 --> 20:27.801

20:27.880 --> 20:29.211
(GUNS COCKING)
(GASPS)

20:29.320 --> 20:32.290
Yo, put away
your Glocks, man.
Yes.

20:32.360 --> 20:35.682
Share with us the wisdom
of the street,
O mighty Alcatraaaz.

20:35.880 --> 20:39.441
There are times in life,
when the truth
ain't black nor white,

20:39.520 --> 20:41.522
but a subtler
shade of gray, yo.

20:41.840 --> 20:44.923
And when the path
for justice is obscured

20:45.000 --> 20:49.324
by the fog of uncertainty,
there is only one solution.

20:49.400 --> 20:50.925
House party!

20:51.000 --> 20:53.082
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
(PEOPLE CHEERING)

20:59.000 --> 21:00.365
(ALL CHEERING)

21:00.680 --> 21:02.045
I don't understand.

21:02.120 --> 21:04.930
After all the corruption
and deceit we witnessed,

21:05.000 --> 21:06.764
how can everyone
just party?

21:06.840 --> 21:09.923
Lisa, the world
is a very complicated place.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.809
And when you get
right down to it...

21:11.880 --> 21:13.166
Cannonball!

21:13.240 --> 21:14.480
(ALL CHEERING)

21:21.560 --> 21:23.449
Do you think
there's a place
in the hip-hop world,

21:23.520 --> 21:26.126
for a 40-something
elementary school
administrator?

21:26.200 --> 21:28.123
Hell, yes.
Hmm.

21:28.280 --> 21:30.328
But I'm already paying
a guy for that.

21:30.400 --> 21:34.564
Skinner! I order you
to step off, dawg.

21:34.800 --> 21:36.131
(ALL LAUGHING)

21:36.200 --> 21:39.886
I think they're
making fun of me
but my wife is very sick.

21:40.360 --> 21:41.407
Whoo!

22:02.480 --> 22:03.481
