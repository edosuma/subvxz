RUDY: Right, well, try to imagine,

00:52.000 --> 00:56.631
if an orang-utan and a bulldog,
they spawned a child, yeah?

00:56.680 --> 00:59.672
Now try and imagine,
that bloody child grows up

00:59.720 --> 01:00.949
- and impregnates a pig.
- Eurgh.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.994
This pig-dog-monkey hybrid thing
would be a thing of beauty in comparison.

Dude, honestly, this girl, man,
she was so physically ugly,

01:08.720 --> 01:10.393
it pained me when I came on her face.

01:10.440 --> 01:13.159
- Brilliant.
- Seriously, she were minging, dude.

01:13.200 --> 01:16.431
If she was so hideously ugly,
why did you have sex with her?

01:16.480 --> 01:18.551
Really? <i>Do you know,
this... this is just...</i>

01:18.600 --> 01:21.194
this is the problem, isn't it, when
you're having sex with ugly birds?

01:21.240 --> 01:23.311
You... you're damned if you do,
and then you're damned if you don't.

01:23.360 --> 01:26.000
I suppose you only have sex with people
you find physically attractive?

01:26.040 --> 01:27.439
It's a weird rule that I have.

01:27.480 --> 01:31.155
Well, that's a bit shallow, isn't it?
That's very shallow, Jess.

01:32.240 --> 01:34.834
What about you, Abs?
You ever done an ugly?

01:34.880 --> 01:37.679
- Does he count?
- No, I don't count!

01:37.720 --> 01:40.792
Trust me. You count. Twice. Double points.

01:40.840 --> 01:43.309
- Why am I double points?
- Cos you're short.

01:43.360 --> 01:45.829
Oh, shit! No, no, no, no, no way!

01:45.880 --> 01:47.951
- Has he seen me?
- Who?

01:48.000 --> 01:51.277
It's me dad. It's me frigging dad.
What's he doing here?

01:51.320 --> 01:52.674
Why are you hiding from your dad?

01:52.720 --> 01:53.994
Because he thinks I'm at university,

01:54.040 --> 01:56.111

in computer science.

I'm President of the Student Union

to the Olympics Squad by that much.

Dude, your mum and dad
are proper going for it.

02:04.880 --> 02:08.794

wouldn't do shit like that. Not in public.

or he's lost something in her vagina.

- Yeah, well, I'm very upset, Finlay.

02:24.080 --> 02:26.640
Shit! Oh, fuck! Is he...

02:26.680 --> 02:30.275

42:03.240 --> 42:07.791
It's just... It's better
if Dad explains it, Mum. Christ.

42:07.840 --> 42:10.195
- And who are you?
- Er...

42:10.240 --> 42:13.153
That's Jessica, my girlfriend, Mum.

42:14.320 --> 42:16.834
Mum, this is Jessica.
Jessica, this is my mum.

42:16.880 --> 42:18.359
Hi.

42:18.400 --> 42:20.357
(GROANING)

42:33.400 --> 42:36.153
He told me everything.

42:36.200 --> 42:40.114
All the flings. All the affairs.

42:42.800 --> 42:45.633
There's nothing you can say to hurt me.

42:47.080 --> 42:51.870
You come anywhere near my husband
or my son again, and I'll kill you.

43:00.080 --> 43:04.597
It's so nice to finally meet
one of Rudy's girlfriends.

43:04.640 --> 43:06.995
- We thought he was gay.
- Rudy?

43:07.040 --> 43:08.758
Gay?

43:08.800 --> 43:12.191
(LAUGHING) He's a total slag.

43:13.400 --> 43:15.516
Errn... not... not a slag.

43:15.560 --> 43:17.915
I mean... I mean, he's lovely.

43:17.960 --> 43:20.474
(LAUGHS) Yes.

43:30.200 --> 43:32.760
- She's lovely.
- Yeah, she is.

43:32.800 --> 43:35.360
She's very lovely indeed, actually.

43:35.400 --> 43:37.710
<i>She's...</i>

43:37.760 --> 43:40.149
- Are you in love with her?
- Whoa! No, shut up, Dad.

43:40.200 --> 43:43.079
No, I'm not in love with her.
Listen to me, seriously.

43:43.120 --> 43:45.031
Jess is only here
pretending to be my girlfriend

43:45.080 --> 43:47.071
so that you and Mum
don't think I'm a gaylord.

43:47.120 --> 43:50.670
Oh, right. Whatever you say.

43:50.720 --> 43:52.711
Huh. Knob.

43:53.880 --> 43:55.712
(SIGHS)

44:25.320 --> 44:29.314
# It's a little-known fact

44:30.360 --> 44:34.513
# When I think of us then... #

44:53.880 --> 44:55.951
Do you want to say something?

44:57.280 --> 44:59.396
You don't have to.

45:05.720 --> 45:07.916
Hi.

45:07.960 --> 45:09.951
My name's Sam.

45:11.160 --> 45:13.117
I can fly.

45:19.240 --> 45:20.275
FINN: He made me sing with him,

45:20.320 --> 45:23.517
in what can only be described
as a very rapey duet.

45:23.560 --> 45:24.595
Dance with me.

45:26.280 --> 45:29.591
RUDY: I need to speak to ya!

45:29.640 --> 45:31.677
About a jumper!

45:31.720 --> 45:33.677
Has anyone seen Abby?

45:33.720 --> 45:36.439
I'm holding each and every one of you
personally responsible for her.

45:41.680 --> 45:44.035
YOUNG LAURA: Scary's coming.

45:45.305 --> 45:51.360
