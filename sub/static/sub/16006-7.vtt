WEBVTT

00:01.120 --> 00:03.760
He's the new boy, Janet.
He feels isolated.

00:03.920 --> 00:05.920
He's an arrogant, patronising
show pony.

00:06.080 --> 00:07.760
You know that every time
a barrister applies

00:07.920 --> 00:09.440
for the senior counsel
position,

00:09.600 --> 00:11.360
well, the silk committee
appoint a colleague

00:11.480 --> 00:12.760
to keep an eye on him.

00:12.920 --> 00:15.720
They've got Janet King
looking at me?

00:15.880 --> 00:19.160
Mr Moreno, I find you not guilty.
You're free to go.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.640
Pull out Judge Renmark's decisions
over the last two years.

00:21.800 --> 00:23.360
- Why?
- Something was dodgy in Moreno.

00:23.520 --> 00:25.760
We're drowning in work
and you're stalking Renmark?

00:25.920 --> 00:28.600
Someone leaned on him. How else
could he get Moreno so wrong?

00:28.760 --> 00:31.320
He's clever. He chooses
his opportunities very carefully,

00:31.480 --> 00:33.720
twists things
just as much as he needs to.

00:33.880 --> 00:35.520
So there's nearly
100% conviction rate

00:35.680 --> 00:37.280
for the last 18 months
until Moreno.

00:37.440 --> 00:39.960
He's convicting everyone
that comes before him.

00:40.120 --> 00:42.640
They're all connected -
Blakely, Nelson, Moreno.

00:42.800 --> 00:44.320
Renmark?
Especially Renmark.

00:44.440 --> 00:45.800
You needed something concrete

00:45.960 --> 00:47.640
before you could start
a formal investigation.

00:47.800 --> 00:51.080
And here it is. You realise
this could sink us both?

00:51.240 --> 00:53.560
I heard you've been reviewing
some of my judgements.

00:53.680 --> 00:54.560
Did you?

00:54.720 --> 00:56.800
I'd tread very carefully
if I were you, Miss King.

00:56.960 --> 00:59.400
My findings could be
very damning,

00:59.560 --> 01:01.960
but I'm offering you
one last chance.

01:02.080 --> 01:03.640
Resign now.

01:03.800 --> 01:06.840
Goodnight, Miss King.
Pleasant dreams.

01:11.560 --> 01:13.760
We've compiled a list
of people

01:13.920 --> 01:15.440
who might hold a grudge
against you.

01:15.600 --> 01:18.360
I don't need this.
I know who did it.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:47.080 --> 01:48.640
What have we got?
Not sure.

01:54.480 --> 01:55.960
What's up, babe?

01:56.120 --> 01:58.480
Hey, handsome. I missed you
at breakfast this morning.

01:58.640 --> 02:01.480
Yeah sorry, they called me out
early. I didn't want to wake you.

02:01.640 --> 02:04.480
Ah, will you have some time
later today or...?

02:05.680 --> 02:09.400
What is it?
Ah, well, it's just, um...

02:09.560 --> 02:13.160
Will you... will you be home
for dinner?

02:13.280 --> 02:16.600
Shit.

02:16.760 --> 02:18.280
I'll, ah...
I'll call you back later.

02:35.080 --> 02:37.360
I should have told him last night.
I'm such a chicken.

02:37.480 --> 02:40.120
He'll call you back when he can.

02:41.840 --> 02:44.360
He's so desperate
to have children.

02:44.480 --> 02:46.840
It's not a definite, is it?

02:47.000 --> 02:49.120
Kids'll happen
when you're both ready.

02:49.280 --> 02:50.400
Probably when you least
expect them.

02:50.560 --> 02:52.880
And if all else fails,
do what the rest of us do

02:53.040 --> 02:55.040
in times of crisis -
bury yourself in work.

02:56.720 --> 03:00.000
Oh, how's Nelson looking, by the
way? Maya ready to demolish him?

03:00.160 --> 03:01.680
Sorry.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.360
Andy, is everything OK?

03:06.520 --> 03:09.160
In one judgement, Renmark even
quotes a precedent from a case

03:09.320 --> 03:11.080
when the case itself
doesn't even exist.

03:11.240 --> 03:13.400
We already have
lots of stuff on him already,

03:13.560 --> 03:16.320
and I've only fully checked
about half of them so far, so...

03:16.480 --> 03:18.280
He's dead.
Who?

03:18.400 --> 03:19.520
Judge Renmark.

03:33.600 --> 03:35.840
Well, we can't be certain
about anything.

03:35.960 --> 03:38.080
It might be suicide.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.640
We haven't found a note.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.200
There's nothing to suggest
he was suicidal.

03:41.360 --> 03:43.560
And it's not a known suicide spot.
An accident?

03:43.720 --> 03:45.960
Could be. Leaning over the edge
to look at something.

03:46.120 --> 03:48.840
Maybe he dropped his parking
ticket and was trying to grab it.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.320
Or maybe some kids were
trying to rob him and, you know,

03:51.440 --> 03:52.920
a bit of shoving got out of hand.

03:53.080 --> 03:54.680
How's the scene?
Anything on the body?

03:54.840 --> 03:57.560
Yeah, bits and pieces
on and around.

03:57.720 --> 04:01.360
Keys, monogrammed handkerchief,
phone,

04:01.480 --> 04:03.440
pen, also monogrammed.

04:03.600 --> 04:05.360
But no wallet.
So it all fits a robbery.

04:05.520 --> 04:07.960
Apart from this,
anything else unexpected?

04:08.080 --> 04:09.840
Not really.

04:11.640 --> 04:13.600
Who was the last person
to see him alive?

04:14.600 --> 04:16.880
Well, he didn't look like a man
about to suicide.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.600
Not when he was in here.

04:18.760 --> 04:22.040
No talk of nothing left to live for
since finishing the job?

04:22.200 --> 04:24.800
What, apart from beach, beer,
test cricket,

04:24.920 --> 04:26.280
a very generous pension scheme?

04:26.400 --> 04:29.760
Oh, retirement's all I live for.

04:29.920 --> 04:34.880
No, not Judge Renmark, no.
He was gloating yesterday.

04:35.040 --> 04:37.200
He had all the rumour
and innuendo he needed

04:37.360 --> 04:39.600
to dump on Janet
from a great height,

04:39.760 --> 04:42.520
and he was relishing
the prospect of doing so.

04:42.680 --> 04:45.200
But he only told me that.
Not Janet?

04:45.360 --> 04:47.560
No, I don't think so.
Was she here?

04:47.680 --> 04:50.040
I'm not sure.

04:50.200 --> 04:52.720
She might have been outside.
I can't remember.

04:52.880 --> 04:55.040
But you didn't see them
talk at all? Um...

04:55.160 --> 04:57.680
OK, thanks.

04:57.840 --> 05:00.880
Yes, I did see him. He stopped
to talk to me on his way out.

05:01.040 --> 05:02.440
And?
He said unless I resigned,

05:02.560 --> 05:04.520
he was intending to get me fired.

05:04.680 --> 05:07.080
Which you would have been
pretty upset about, I imagine.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.720
It's hardly unexpected,
but if you're looking for people

05:09.880 --> 05:11.960
who'd gain by his death,
I suppose I'm one of them.

05:12.120 --> 05:13.640
Although you did have
witness protection officers

05:13.760 --> 05:15.320
outside your door all night,

05:15.480 --> 05:16.840
which is pretty good
as alibis go.

05:16.960 --> 05:18.200
Any other ideas?

05:18.360 --> 05:19.760
The more we look
at the crime scene,

05:19.920 --> 05:21.760
the more it looks like there
was some sort of altercation.

05:21.920 --> 05:23.440
One of his shirt buttons
was missing,

05:23.600 --> 05:25.480
a few of his items
were scattered around the body.

05:25.640 --> 05:27.160
A random attack got out of hand.
Random?

05:27.320 --> 05:29.880
It's our best bet at the moment.
Random?! Are you serious?

05:30.040 --> 05:32.000
We know that Renmark
let Moreno off in court,

05:32.160 --> 05:33.920
and Moreno rented
Blakely's beach house.

05:34.080 --> 05:35.680
We know that Blakely and Nelson
are linked,

05:35.840 --> 05:37.880
and as soon as we started
lifting the lid on them,

05:38.000 --> 05:39.240
Blakely was killed

05:39.400 --> 05:41.520
and my whole family was nearly
blown up, and now Renmark.

05:41.680 --> 05:43.320
Of course I think
it's something bigger.

05:43.480 --> 05:46.480
We still can't prove Moreno
and Blakely even knew each other,

05:46.640 --> 05:49.760
and your car was blown up by
ammonium nitrate and coal dust.

05:49.920 --> 05:53.000
That says to us someone big.
Someone with serious connections.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.040
Yes.

05:54.200 --> 05:57.080
And I doubt a guy like Moreno could
even mix that stuff together.

05:58.280 --> 05:59.920
You really don't think
Renmark's death

06:00.040 --> 06:01.560
could have been a random attack?

06:01.720 --> 06:04.240
He was being influenced by someone
to bend his judgements,

06:04.400 --> 06:06.600
then suddenly he finds out
he's being investigated

06:06.760 --> 06:08.080
and oh, dear,
there's a random attack?

06:08.240 --> 06:11.120
Come on, Andy! It is someone
with serious connections.

06:11.240 --> 06:12.840
That is exactly my point.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.440
What, he knew he was being
investigated?

06:15.600 --> 06:18.080
I think they're talking
about me.

06:19.680 --> 06:22.320
You're paranoid. Why would they
be talking about you?

06:22.480 --> 06:24.640
I can tell. I've got
a very acute sense of this.

06:24.760 --> 06:26.520
Richard, a judge is dead.

06:26.680 --> 06:29.520
We've got an unsolved murder of a
police officer and a car bombing.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.240
You really think
they're talking about you?

06:31.360 --> 06:33.520
No, no, you're right.

06:33.640 --> 06:34.800
Richard!

06:39.640 --> 06:41.920
When you were collating
Renmark's judgements,

06:42.080 --> 06:44.840
did you talk to any counsel,
mention what you were doing

06:45.000 --> 06:47.560
about Renmark to any other
solicitors, admin staff?

06:47.720 --> 06:50.240
No. I mean, most of it
was on the online database.

06:50.360 --> 06:52.240
Didn't talk to anyone?

06:52.400 --> 06:53.960
Well, I had to ask
a couple of clerks

06:54.120 --> 06:55.360
for a few of
the older judgements,

06:55.520 --> 06:58.320
but I always said I was
checking for precedent.

06:58.480 --> 07:00.720
I never mentioned Renmark
personally. OK. Thanks, Richard.

07:03.560 --> 07:05.240
Someone from the
Courts Admin Authority

07:05.360 --> 07:07.160
may have noticed something or...

07:08.520 --> 07:11.320
One of the juniors from around...

07:11.440 --> 07:13.000
Owen knew. I told him

07:13.160 --> 07:15.320
when I asked about the Crown
against Gianopolous judgement.

07:15.480 --> 07:17.400
When was this?
Yesterday.

07:18.840 --> 07:22.800
Mate, you got a sec?
Yeah, what's up?

07:22.920 --> 07:24.560
Renmark's dead.

07:24.720 --> 07:26.920
Fell off a car park
four storeys up last night.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.840
Fell?
Fell, pushed, who knows?

07:30.000 --> 07:33.760
Did you tell anyone about Richard
going back over his judgements?

07:33.920 --> 07:37.320
No.
Great.

07:37.480 --> 07:39.120
He's dead? Really?
Yeah.

07:39.240 --> 07:40.880
How do you fall off a car park?

07:41.040 --> 07:43.200
Easy if you get pushed.
Who else was there?

07:43.360 --> 07:45.520
What are you thinking?
Don't know.

07:45.680 --> 07:49.000
Forensics give you anything?
CCTV? Not much, no.

07:49.160 --> 07:51.960
Wow, this is getting
weirder and weirder.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.160
Yeah, I know.

07:53.320 --> 07:55.120
It all means
another investigation, of course,

07:55.280 --> 07:57.040
trawling over the last few months
of his life.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.080
Yeah, I can imagine
there's a few questions.

07:59.240 --> 08:01.360
Yeah. Why was he appointed
to run this inquiry

08:01.480 --> 08:03.200
into Janet and Erin?

08:03.360 --> 08:06.640
And did he lobby for it?
Who fed the story to the media?

08:06.800 --> 08:09.480
He sure wanted Janet out of
this place, we know that much.

08:11.280 --> 08:13.400
If you hear anything
just let me know.

08:13.520 --> 08:14.400
Yep.

08:14.520 --> 08:15.840
Gotta run.

08:23.040 --> 08:24.480
Tonight, I promise.

08:24.640 --> 08:27.120
Before we go to sleep,
we're going to get half an hour.

08:27.280 --> 08:29.920
You can talk and I will listen.
Thank you.

08:30.080 --> 08:33.360
OK? What's it about, anyway?
My fertility results.

08:37.840 --> 08:40.400
But it's not a ten second
conversation.

08:40.559 --> 08:43.960
But tonight, though, please.
I promise, OK? I really promise.

08:55.040 --> 08:56.520
Where was it?

08:56.680 --> 09:00.200
Renmark's study,
taped up underneath the desk.

09:00.360 --> 09:01.840
Who found it?
Me.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.240
No-one else knows? No-one.
I took it out and texted you.

09:04.360 --> 09:05.960
OK, thanks.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.720
- This had better be good.
- Oh, it is.

09:12.840 --> 09:14.200
Normally, I hate surprises.

09:14.360 --> 09:16.240
We were searching through
Renmark's house,

09:16.400 --> 09:18.880
looking for anything that might
indicate why he went out.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.400
Excuse us for a sec.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.280
Or who he was planning to meet.
Anything, really.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.080
And we found this USB.

09:24.240 --> 09:26.480
That's the same one that was
at Keith Nelson's house.

09:26.640 --> 09:28.600
Correct,
but Nelson's had nothing on it.

09:28.720 --> 09:30.040
And Renmark's?

09:30.200 --> 09:36.200
Over 84,000 photos,
over 30 videos of porn.

09:36.320 --> 09:38.600
All clearly underage.

09:38.760 --> 09:41.200
Any idea where these images
come from?

09:41.320 --> 09:42.680
We're still checking.

09:42.840 --> 09:44.840
The kids,
they're from everywhere.

09:50.320 --> 09:52.680
Fuckin' hell.

09:55.440 --> 09:59.120
Owen, Maya just... Sorry.
What?

09:59.280 --> 10:01.000
Maya just sent an email
to Janet and me

10:01.160 --> 10:03.480
confirming she won't be a witness
on the Nelson trial.

10:03.640 --> 10:05.200
Which means there's a record
of it now.

10:05.360 --> 10:07.960
You know, for the date?
Right.

10:08.080 --> 10:09.880
Well, what should I do about it?

10:10.040 --> 10:11.920
I don't know.
Let me think about it.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.000
I'll get back to you.
Gotta make a call.

10:15.120 --> 10:16.040
OK.

10:19.080 --> 10:21.520
- Where's he going?
- Out to make a call.

10:21.680 --> 10:23.200
Did you see that email
that Maya sent?

10:23.360 --> 10:24.880
Yes.
Well, what do I do?

10:25.000 --> 10:27.120
Well, we have to change her mind.

10:27.280 --> 10:29.720
Can you please beg her to let us
have one more conversation?

10:29.880 --> 10:32.360
Mm, I'll see what I can do.
Thanks.

10:34.480 --> 10:37.400
Can't you make it lunchtime?
That won't be nearly so obvious.

10:40.080 --> 10:42.400
OK, well, what time
does your flight leave?

10:42.560 --> 10:45.240
What about tonight?
Got time tonight?

10:45.360 --> 10:47.480
Alright, yep, 9am.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.920
No, not on the phone.

10:50.080 --> 10:54.240
Thank you.
Yeah, tomorrow morning then.

10:54.400 --> 10:58.040
Yeah, same place.
OK, yep, bye.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.920
Uh, uh, uh, not so fast.

11:05.080 --> 11:06.720
Can you come with me?
Why, what is it?

11:06.880 --> 11:09.480
I have some good news, which is
an unexpected turn of events

11:09.600 --> 11:11.160
given the last few weeks,

11:11.320 --> 11:15.720
but I have no intention
of saying it twice, so in here.

11:15.840 --> 11:17.720
I have something to impart.

11:17.880 --> 11:20.760
Right, well, I've just come
from a conference call

11:20.920 --> 11:22.560
with the President
of the Law Society

11:22.720 --> 11:24.360
and her Holiness,
the Attorney-General.

11:24.520 --> 11:28.640
In the aftermath of Judge
Renmark's tragic death,

11:28.800 --> 11:30.640
we were reviewing the inquiry
he was heading

11:30.800 --> 11:32.640
and I was able to tell
my learned colleagues

11:32.800 --> 11:36.040
that when Judge Renmark was
summarising his findings to me

11:36.200 --> 11:37.880
last night,
prior to writing his report,

11:38.000 --> 11:39.720
he indicated that he could find

11:39.840 --> 11:41.560
no substance in the rumours

11:41.720 --> 11:45.880
and he was intending to clear you
both of all accusations.

11:46.040 --> 11:48.200
He was? That's my recollection
of the conversation.

11:48.360 --> 11:50.440
I don't think anyone else
was there, were they?

11:50.560 --> 11:52.320
No.

11:52.480 --> 11:56.680
So the upshot is, the inquiry
is to be abandoned,

11:56.840 --> 11:59.600
which means you're straight,
you're gay,

11:59.760 --> 12:02.720
you're a solicitor advocate
and we're all just good friends.

12:02.840 --> 12:04.560
No need for thanks.

12:04.720 --> 12:07.040
Applause and alcohol
at the appropriate time

12:07.160 --> 12:09.200
will be gratefully received.

12:09.360 --> 12:11.840
Right, well, um...
see you then.

12:16.360 --> 12:20.680
Are we OK?
Yes, Erin, we're OK.

12:20.840 --> 12:24.200
Let's just not drink together, hmm?
Deal.

12:31.160 --> 12:33.280
OK, so this is
how it's looking so far.

12:33.400 --> 12:34.960
Someone who we don't know yet,

12:35.120 --> 12:37.320
possibly someone here,
possibly not,

12:37.480 --> 12:39.320
finds out that Renmark
is a paedophile

12:39.480 --> 12:42.800
and forces Renmark to
convict all these shitkickers

12:42.960 --> 12:45.040
because it suits him
to have them in jail.

12:45.160 --> 12:47.400
Yeah, but Renmark acquits Moreno,

12:47.560 --> 12:49.080
and the Moreno family
go on holidays

12:49.200 --> 12:50.760
to Steven Blakely's beach house

12:50.920 --> 12:52.280
and some of the photos
taken there

12:52.440 --> 12:53.800
end up
on an Eastern European website.

12:53.960 --> 12:55.600
While Renmark's stash of porn
is found

12:55.760 --> 12:57.960
on the same sort of USB
Nelson has.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.760
And Keith Nelson was a mate
of Steve Blakely.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.560
And in Janet's scenario,

13:02.720 --> 13:04.360
this someone killed Steve
when he thought

13:04.520 --> 13:05.960
they were all about
to be uncovered,

13:06.120 --> 13:08.760
then tried to kill Janet when
she started guessing the truth

13:08.920 --> 13:11.520
and killed Renmark as soon
as he knew we were onto him.

13:11.640 --> 13:13.240
If this is one person,

13:13.400 --> 13:15.120
then we're dealing
with a serious player here.

13:15.240 --> 13:17.120
Any ideas?

13:17.280 --> 13:20.200
Ask Keith Nelson.
He's the one who can tell us.

13:20.360 --> 13:22.680
I know, but why would he?
Have you put it to him?

13:22.800 --> 13:23.800
Put what to him?

13:23.960 --> 13:26.280
I can hardly say, 'We'll go easy
on you for assaulting Maya

13:26.440 --> 13:28.280
if you tell us who ran
the child porn ring

13:28.440 --> 13:30.200
that we're not even sure
you belonged to?'

13:30.360 --> 13:31.760
Nelson had the same USB
as Renmark,

13:31.920 --> 13:33.800
and Renmark's was full
of illegal kiddie photos.

13:33.960 --> 13:35.800
That's got to be worth
a polite question, doesn't it?

13:35.960 --> 13:37.800
Yes, but he's also
a up-himself son of a bitch

13:37.960 --> 13:39.200
who's convinced
he's going to get off.

13:39.360 --> 13:42.280
Then convince him he's not.
It's 15 years old!

13:42.440 --> 13:44.760
Her word against his.
I'm not a bloody magician.

13:44.920 --> 13:46.600
Now, I'll go in
as hard as you like

13:46.760 --> 13:48.760
if or when Nelson starts
to realise he's been cornered.

13:48.920 --> 13:50.880
So if there's anything more
you or Owen can do

13:51.040 --> 13:53.680
to get him to that point,
it will be very, very helpful.

13:56.200 --> 13:59.080
We won't hound you, Maya,
I promise,

13:59.240 --> 14:02.160
but it's been some time
since the committal

14:02.280 --> 14:03.920
and we thought...

14:04.080 --> 14:06.320
we thought if we could just
have one last meeting...

14:06.480 --> 14:10.200
Do you think that I'll
change my mind?

14:10.360 --> 14:12.440
Well, I want to be able to say
we tried. That's all.

14:14.920 --> 14:17.720
If I agree to one more, that'd be
it, right? No more follow-ups?

14:17.840 --> 14:19.640
No more, guaranteed.

14:19.760 --> 14:22.160
With you and Owen?

14:22.280 --> 14:24.520
Probably. Yeah, sure.

14:24.640 --> 14:26.320
No, just... just you two.

14:26.480 --> 14:29.440
OK.
I really don't want to see Janet.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.520
No, you won't.
She's a witness in the case.

14:31.640 --> 14:33.480
She can't be part of it.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.120
It'll just be Owen and me.

14:38.040 --> 14:40.120
Yeah, alright. OK.

14:41.600 --> 14:44.760
Just spoke to Maya.
She didn't hang up on you?

14:44.920 --> 14:47.560
She said she'll give us half an
hour to say our bit, that's all.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.680
Nine o'clock tomorrow.
That's great.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.160
Maya's coming in at nine o'clock
tomorrow.

14:55.320 --> 14:57.080
Can we talk about
how you should approach her?

14:57.240 --> 14:58.720
Obviously, this is very,
very important.

14:58.880 --> 15:00.400
I can't do nine.
What?

15:00.560 --> 15:02.440
I can't do nine o'clock.
Can you make it ten?

15:02.600 --> 15:04.440
No, I was lucky to get her here
at all.

15:04.600 --> 15:06.280
Well, I'm sorry, I can't do nine.
Why not?

15:06.440 --> 15:08.160
I've got another appointment.
Where?

15:08.320 --> 15:10.040
Excuse me? Where are you going
that could possibly

15:10.200 --> 15:12.760
be more important than changing
Maya's mind about this trial?

15:12.920 --> 15:15.120
Janet, take a Valium or have
a massage or something.

15:15.240 --> 15:16.600
Just relax.

15:18.160 --> 15:20.520
Owen, if we have to tell the court
Maya's withdrawn,

15:20.640 --> 15:22.040
Nelson walks away

15:22.200 --> 15:24.600
and we lose our best chance of
finding out who's behind all of this.

15:24.720 --> 15:26.000
Anytime after lunch.

15:26.160 --> 15:27.840
Evening, midnight, I don't care.
I can't make nine.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.400
If I call her again, I really
think she'll pull out completely.

15:30.520 --> 15:32.200
Cancel it.

15:32.360 --> 15:34.600
Whatever it is at nine,
why don't you reschedule that?

15:34.760 --> 15:37.000
If you wanted me here at nine,
you should have asked me.

15:37.160 --> 15:39.440
Don't just set a meeting
and then assume I can make it.

15:42.640 --> 15:45.240
Where are you going?
I don't have to tell you.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.920
Lina.

15:56.080 --> 15:59.520
Listen, I really do want to
run this matter.

15:59.640 --> 16:01.320
Can you please call Maya?

16:01.440 --> 16:03.760
See if she can reschedule.

16:16.920 --> 16:18.720
Janet.
Don't contact Maya.

16:18.880 --> 16:20.640
If we've only got one shot,
do it tomorrow.

16:20.760 --> 16:23.120
OK, should I tell Owen?

16:23.280 --> 16:26.200
No, not yet. Maybe text him tonight
or maybe tomorrow morning.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.600
Just wait as long as you can
and then say you tried

16:28.720 --> 16:30.320
but she wouldn't change.

16:30.440 --> 16:33.360
OK. Um, if he finds out...

16:33.520 --> 16:35.720
Look, I'll cop any fallout.
Don't worry about that.

16:35.880 --> 16:37.560
Just leave it as it is though,
yeah?

16:37.720 --> 16:39.200
OK.
Thanks.

16:39.360 --> 16:40.800
And can you just come
into my office?

16:40.960 --> 16:43.200
I want to play out a few angles,
see how they sound.

16:43.360 --> 16:45.080
And see if Erin's around too,
yeah? Sure.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.640
Thanks.

16:50.080 --> 16:51.160
Hey.
Hey.

16:51.320 --> 16:52.960
Have you got a second?
Sure.

16:57.560 --> 16:59.600
I've been thinking about Renmark,
and how he knew

16:59.720 --> 17:01.520
what we found out about him.

17:01.680 --> 17:03.720
And the rest of us,
we were all on the team

17:03.840 --> 17:05.000
who were doing the finding out,

17:05.160 --> 17:09.839
so I'm just thinking,
it had to be Owen, didn't it?

17:10.000 --> 17:13.119
Or at least come from him,
indirectly somehow.

17:14.760 --> 17:16.119
Sit.

17:16.240 --> 17:17.960
When you asked Owen

17:18.119 --> 17:20.240
about that case he ran
in front of Renmark...

17:20.400 --> 17:21.920
Crown against Gianopolous.
Yes.

17:22.079 --> 17:24.599
Did you say enough for Owen to
know that you'd found a matter

17:24.760 --> 17:26.640
in which Renmark
had lied in his judgement?

17:26.760 --> 17:27.720
Yes.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.120
Can you close the door?

17:37.040 --> 17:38.680
If anyone interrupts us,

17:38.840 --> 17:40.480
just say we're having a small
informal gathering

17:40.640 --> 17:43.400
to celebrate the fact that,
I don't know,

17:43.520 --> 17:44.840
the inquiry's been abandoned.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.560
Mm, I'll drink to that.
Congratulations.

17:47.680 --> 17:48.960
Now before we get on to Maya,

17:49.120 --> 17:51.160
didn't you say once,
back on the Simpson matter,

17:51.320 --> 17:53.480
that Owen had got bank records
without a subpoena?

17:53.640 --> 17:54.880
Yep.
How?

17:55.040 --> 17:57.040
I always thought he'd asked
one of his copper friends.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.520
Has he ever done anything
that you thought was dodgy?

17:59.680 --> 18:02.840
Is this just for this room?
Yes.

18:02.960 --> 18:05.080
Well, I did ask him

18:05.240 --> 18:08.360
how I could prove one of the girls
in those photos

18:08.520 --> 18:10.600
for the Clarke matter
was underage, and he said,

18:10.760 --> 18:13.120
'Why don't you slip a photo of
a five-year-old in there?

18:13.240 --> 18:14.600
No-one would pick it.'

18:15.920 --> 18:18.520
Oh, my God, what if
he paid Renmark

18:18.640 --> 18:20.960
to find Gianopolous guilty?

18:21.120 --> 18:23.040
Whoa, I think that might be
going a bit far.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.160
Is it?
What if it was blackmail?

18:25.320 --> 18:28.680
What if he discovered
Renmark's interest

18:28.800 --> 18:29.840
in child pornography

18:30.000 --> 18:32.040
and used that to force him
to make convictions?

18:32.200 --> 18:34.800
That would mean that Owen was
the one controlling everything.

18:34.920 --> 18:35.920
Exactly.

18:44.160 --> 18:45.640
No.
Why not?

18:45.760 --> 18:47.320
We already know he cheats

18:47.480 --> 18:49.160
if he thinks the end
justifies the means.

18:49.320 --> 18:51.000
We know he benefited from some
of those convictions himself.

18:51.120 --> 18:52.360
It all adds up.

18:52.520 --> 18:54.040
Aren't we getting a bit
carried away here?

18:54.200 --> 18:56.440
He knows that you were on
the right track with Moreno,

18:56.560 --> 18:57.800
that explains the car bomb.

18:57.960 --> 18:59.720
Then I mention that Renmark
is being investigated

18:59.880 --> 19:01.760
and he couldn't take the risk
that Renmark might talk

19:01.880 --> 19:03.240
to save his reputation.

19:03.360 --> 19:04.720
Wait a second, just back it up.

19:04.880 --> 19:06.960
Don't you also think Nelson's
a part of all this gang?

19:07.120 --> 19:10.400
And yet isn't Owen trying hard to
convict Nelson? How does that work?

19:10.560 --> 19:13.200
What do you think? Do you think he
really wants to prosecute Nelson?

19:13.360 --> 19:15.280
I don't know.
What?

19:15.440 --> 19:17.800
We said that we wanted to talk
to Maya tomorrow morning,

19:17.920 --> 19:20.080
and see if she could testify again,

19:20.240 --> 19:22.760
but Owen said he had to be somewhere
else and wouldn't say where.

19:22.920 --> 19:24.560
There you go.
What, she pulled out?

19:24.680 --> 19:25.840
Long story.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.280
Owen also knows that
if we can put some heat on Nelson,

19:28.440 --> 19:31.080
he might be able to tell us more
about who tried to kill me.

19:31.240 --> 19:34.960
But... Now you're saying
that person could be Owen?

19:35.120 --> 19:37.640
Well, who is suddenly unavailable
to talk a witness around

19:37.800 --> 19:39.280
so the case against Nelson
falls apart.

19:39.400 --> 19:40.560
I mean, how convenient.

19:40.720 --> 19:42.200
That's mad.
Is it?

19:42.320 --> 19:43.400
Yes.

19:48.880 --> 19:50.880
Right. Thanks.

20:10.440 --> 20:12.360
Yes?

20:12.520 --> 20:14.640
Hi, Tracey. I just...
it's no big deal.

20:14.800 --> 20:17.440
In fact, you don't even have to
tell me even if you do know.

20:17.560 --> 20:19.040
I just wanted to know if you did.

20:19.200 --> 20:22.120
Know what? Where Owen's going
tomorrow morning.

20:22.240 --> 20:23.520
He's here, as far as I know.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.960
Ah, no, he told Janet and Lina
he had an appointment

20:26.080 --> 20:27.440
and wouldn't be in till ten.

20:27.600 --> 20:30.040
News to me. But even if he is,
why should it bother you?

20:30.160 --> 20:31.440
Oh, no, it doesn't.

20:31.600 --> 20:35.000
But he wouldn't tell
Janet or Lina either

20:35.160 --> 20:38.120
and, um, we don't need to know
where he's going,

20:38.280 --> 20:40.320
we just want to know
that you know

20:40.480 --> 20:43.280
so that if there's an emergency,
you can contact him for us.

20:43.400 --> 20:45.760
Oh, thank you, Richard.

20:45.920 --> 20:48.400
Your concern for office efficiency
is most welcome.

20:48.520 --> 20:50.800
Right. Great. OK, then.

21:03.120 --> 21:04.920
The respected
District Court judge

21:05.080 --> 21:06.720
apparently died
after falling from

21:06.880 --> 21:10.080
a multistorey car park in
the early hours of this morning,

21:10.200 --> 21:11.800
but police are yet to release

21:11.960 --> 21:13.480
the details surrounding
the incident.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.160
We're appealing to the public
for any information

21:15.280 --> 21:16.520
regarding this incident.

21:16.680 --> 21:17.840
Are you treating it
as an accident?

21:18.000 --> 21:20.560
We're pursuing several lines
of inquiry at the moment,

21:20.720 --> 21:22.280
but we won't say anything
more definite

21:22.440 --> 21:24.640
until we've completed
further investigations.

21:24.760 --> 21:25.720
Thank you.

21:56.360 --> 21:58.000
I'm off.
Good-o.

21:58.160 --> 22:00.400
Got something on tomorrow morning.
I'll be in about ten.

22:00.560 --> 22:02.680
Oh, whereabouts?
Be on the mobile.

22:02.840 --> 22:04.440
I really should know
where you are.

22:04.560 --> 22:06.200
Tough. Tell Janet I said that.

22:12.040 --> 22:13.560
How'd you go with Maya?

22:13.720 --> 22:15.840
Tried.
She said she'd get back to me.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.240
Text or email when you get
an answer from her, please?

22:24.240 --> 22:26.280
Oh, I hate lying.

22:26.440 --> 22:29.320
That is one of the many things
I love about you.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.720
So, what does 'idiopathic' mean,
exactly?

22:35.840 --> 22:37.960
Well, according to Google,

22:38.120 --> 22:40.160
it means 'arising from
an unknown cause'.

22:40.280 --> 22:41.640
Ain't that the truth.

22:41.800 --> 22:43.480
Basically, they don't know.
Nope.

22:43.640 --> 22:45.520
So when they say
idiopathic infertility,

22:45.680 --> 22:47.360
they're really saying
it could be permanent,

22:47.520 --> 22:49.840
it could be temporary, we're
in the dark, you might have kids,

22:49.960 --> 22:51.280
you might not, we can't tell.

22:51.440 --> 22:53.800
Yep. And then they charge you
$180.

22:53.920 --> 22:56.320
I want their job.

23:01.080 --> 23:04.720
Hey, just don't think, you know,
if it doesn't happen,

23:04.880 --> 23:08.680
that it's going to eat away at me
or anything.

23:08.800 --> 23:11.040
There'll be a reason.

23:13.040 --> 23:15.080
We're still gonna be together.

23:18.200 --> 23:20.000
And you know, if it does happen,

23:20.160 --> 23:21.760
it'll happen
when it's meant to happen.

23:21.880 --> 23:24.080
I really believe that.

23:27.720 --> 23:32.720
Sorry, I've... it's...
It's OK.

23:32.840 --> 23:36.120
It's OK. I cried too.

23:36.240 --> 23:39.000
I love you.

24:23.240 --> 24:25.520
Hi, darling.
No, no, it's good.

24:25.640 --> 24:27.760
I'm well. I'm well out of bed.

24:27.920 --> 24:31.080
Yeah, I'm just up
and getting some exercise.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.760
What about you?

24:35.480 --> 24:37.240
How are the little ones
treating you?

24:39.080 --> 24:41.520
Really?
They are being good for you.

24:45.080 --> 24:47.520
Yeah, I'm just...
I'm just watching the dawn.

24:47.640 --> 24:49.800
Isn't it beautiful?

24:50.800 --> 24:52.480
Can you see it
from where you are?

24:54.680 --> 24:56.280
Yeah, it's beautiful.

25:02.360 --> 25:07.360
You know, it feels like
you're here with me.

25:10.600 --> 25:12.560
All together again.

25:14.200 --> 25:16.520
Yeah, I hope so. Soon.

25:19.680 --> 25:21.600
I miss you.

25:23.920 --> 25:26.840
OK. Bye.

25:40.920 --> 25:43.280
Owen Mitchell?
That's their latest theory.

25:43.400 --> 25:44.760
I said it was bullshit.

25:44.920 --> 25:47.320
You didn't know Owen when
he was a cop, did you?

25:47.480 --> 25:49.720
Not really, and by the time
I did the detective course

25:49.880 --> 25:51.360
he was already
in police prosecution.

25:51.520 --> 25:53.080
Yeah, he worked under a guy
called Aarne Tees

25:53.200 --> 25:54.520
when he first started.

25:54.680 --> 25:57.360
Oh, wow. Now, there's a famous name
from the bad old days.

25:57.520 --> 25:59.360
Aarne used to type up
a lot of his confessions.

25:59.520 --> 26:02.160
Rumour has it that once or twice
he actually stuck to the story

26:02.280 --> 26:03.400
the offender told him.

26:03.560 --> 26:05.760
Courts accepted
written confessions back then.

26:05.920 --> 26:07.320
Should I take him
more seriously?

26:07.480 --> 26:09.960
Not yet. No, I'll ask
a few more questions.

26:10.120 --> 26:12.760
You just stick with
Nelson and Moreno, OK?

26:18.920 --> 26:20.800
Good morning,
Miss Solicitor Advocate.

26:20.960 --> 26:22.880
Hi. How's that Clarke matter
travelling?

26:23.040 --> 26:25.880
Still waiting for Moreno's wife
Eliza to land back in the country.

26:26.040 --> 26:28.680
The defence won't accept
birth certificates, apparently.

26:28.800 --> 26:30.160
I suppose you knew that?

26:30.320 --> 26:32.200
Yes, they want to hear it
from a live person,

26:32.360 --> 26:33.640
because we're so much
more reliable.

26:36.880 --> 26:39.800
I Googled myself last night.
Feel good?

26:39.960 --> 26:42.480
Sorry, couldn't help myself.
Tragic, I know, at my age.

26:42.640 --> 26:44.000
Well, the inquiry
might have been abandoned

26:44.120 --> 26:45.520
but I'm still all over the net

26:45.680 --> 26:48.080
as the lesbian lawyer who had
an affair to get promoted.

26:48.200 --> 26:49.680
Not much you can do about it.

26:49.840 --> 26:51.280
I could call up some journos,
maybe.

26:51.440 --> 26:53.640
Go on the radio, get the truth
out, clear my name...

26:53.800 --> 26:56.320
Don't.
I've got to do something.

26:56.480 --> 26:58.120
No, no, I know from bitter
experience,

26:58.280 --> 26:59.600
the more you deny
an allegation,

26:59.760 --> 27:01.080
the more substance
they give it.

27:01.240 --> 27:03.640
The press are jackals.
They'll twist anything.

27:03.800 --> 27:06.000
Tony, this stuff about me
is all over the net.

27:06.120 --> 27:07.520
Well, don't give it any oxygen.

27:07.680 --> 27:09.400
I know it's hard
and totally unfair,

27:09.560 --> 27:11.960
but they are bastards,
every last one of them.

27:28.240 --> 27:30.840
OK. Well, it's no secret
what we'd like to talk about.

27:30.960 --> 27:33.240
Really? Could have fooled me.

27:33.400 --> 27:36.000
We just want to make sure
you're certain.

27:36.160 --> 27:39.240
That's all.
Certain? Certain of what?

27:39.400 --> 27:40.720
Certain that I can live
with myself

27:40.880 --> 27:43.160
knowing that I could have helped
save a lot of other girls

27:43.280 --> 27:44.720
but I didn't?

27:44.880 --> 27:47.120
I could have been an inspiration
to other people like me?

27:47.280 --> 27:49.800
I could have showed everyone
why bastards like Nelson

27:49.920 --> 27:51.200
can't get away with it?

27:51.360 --> 27:53.320
No, I think
we've already said that.

27:53.440 --> 27:55.440
Yeah, you have.

27:58.080 --> 28:01.520
We've all thought a lot about
what you said after the committal.

28:01.640 --> 28:03.480
Who is we?

28:03.640 --> 28:05.200
Owen and me.

28:06.520 --> 28:08.320
Maya, hi. Sorry.

28:08.480 --> 28:10.400
Owen's just called in.
He's been caught up.

28:10.560 --> 28:13.280
Something's happened at home,
but he wanted me to sit in for him.

28:13.440 --> 28:18.360
He knows you can't spare us much
time, so where were you up to?

28:18.520 --> 28:21.000
Can we just...
It's OK.

28:21.160 --> 28:24.280
No. Ah, sorry. Sorry, Maya.
Ah, could we just...?

28:28.160 --> 28:29.640
Just a second.

28:30.640 --> 28:32.760
Yeah.

28:35.080 --> 28:36.720
What do you think you're doing?
Me?

28:36.880 --> 28:38.720
You can't just ask me out
for a private chat.

28:38.880 --> 28:41.120
What do you think that's telling
her? You don't want me there?

28:41.280 --> 28:43.160
She doesn't want you in there.
Of course she doesn't.

28:43.320 --> 28:46.320
She knows I get inside her head
which is why I need to be in there.

28:46.440 --> 28:47.520
Janet, you're a witness.

28:47.680 --> 28:49.960
If the defence finds out you're
in there having a conference

28:50.120 --> 28:51.800
with the victim,
they'll have a field day.

28:51.960 --> 28:54.040
How's that gonna happen?
Are you gonna post it on YouTube?

28:54.200 --> 28:56.440
No! Then let's ignore that
objection. Anything else?

28:56.560 --> 28:57.920
It is so inappropriate what...

28:58.080 --> 29:00.360
I'm sorry, you're saying
I'm inappropriate?

29:00.520 --> 29:03.400
Aren't you facing an assault
charge, for hitting a defendant

29:03.560 --> 29:06.320
in broad daylight in front of
a dozen witnesses?

29:06.480 --> 29:09.200
You are days away from facing
a criminal record,

29:09.360 --> 29:10.760
and you have the gall
to stand there

29:10.880 --> 29:12.240
and tell me what's appropriate?

29:12.360 --> 29:14.320
Do you have any vague notion

29:14.480 --> 29:16.360
of how stupendously hypocritical
that is?

29:22.160 --> 29:24.160
Sorry about that.

29:24.320 --> 29:26.160
A small misunderstanding.
It's all sorted now.

29:26.320 --> 29:29.200
Let me guess. Don't tell me.
You got your way?

29:29.360 --> 29:33.840
Maya, I'm not here to trap you
or outsmart you.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.240
The fact is, at the committal
you handled yourself brilliantly.

29:37.360 --> 29:38.960
And you want me to get back up

29:39.120 --> 29:41.720
and say it all again
while he watches me.

29:41.880 --> 29:45.480
While he sits there
and listens to me.

29:45.640 --> 29:49.120
He actually gets to do it to me
all over again

29:49.240 --> 29:51.600
just by hearing me say it.

29:51.720 --> 29:53.240
Why would I do that to myself?

29:55.080 --> 29:57.200
You once told me that your dad
helped you a lot.

29:57.320 --> 29:58.400
Yeah.

29:58.560 --> 30:00.840
Can you remember what he did
or said?

30:01.000 --> 30:03.600
Well, he made me stronger and
he gave me a lot of confidence,

30:03.760 --> 30:07.520
especially about making decisions
for myself.

30:07.680 --> 30:09.360
Why, do you think
that Dad would say

30:09.520 --> 30:11.440
I've let Nelson beat me
if he were around now?

30:11.560 --> 30:12.800
Well, you have at the moment.

30:12.960 --> 30:15.120
Yeah, but that is my decision,
right?

30:15.280 --> 30:17.720
This is my decision.
It's not yours!

30:20.200 --> 30:22.760
We don't want to
talk you into anything

30:22.920 --> 30:24.400
into anything you don't want
to do.

30:24.560 --> 30:27.120
We're just saying if you want
to change your mind, that's OK.

30:27.280 --> 30:30.800
Oh, thank you. Oh,
that's different. Um, no.

30:32.040 --> 30:33.600
We want to make absolutely sure

30:33.760 --> 30:35.240
you won't regret a decision
you made

30:35.400 --> 30:40.000
at a highly emotional moment when
there's still time to change it.

30:43.160 --> 30:47.200
Hello, Maya. Ah, we've met before.
Tony Gillies.

30:47.360 --> 30:49.040
Ah, Janet, could I see you
in your office?

30:49.160 --> 30:50.560
I'll be along in a second.

30:50.720 --> 30:53.000
We're almost done here.
It's urgent.

30:56.400 --> 30:57.880
Sure.

31:06.640 --> 31:09.480
You, ah... you really don't want
to get up in court again,

31:09.600 --> 31:11.080
do you, Maya?

31:13.360 --> 31:15.920
No.
Oh, it's not much fun.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.600
If you could stay out of court

31:17.760 --> 31:19.800
and still see Nelson get
what's coming to him,

31:19.960 --> 31:21.520
well, that'd be sweet,
wouldn't it?

31:21.680 --> 31:24.200
Yeah. The irony is,
if you do agree to give evidence,

31:24.320 --> 31:25.640
you'd probably get your wish.

31:25.800 --> 31:28.160
Because if Nelson knows you're
gonna be as strong as you were

31:28.280 --> 31:29.400
at that committal,

31:29.560 --> 31:32.840
well, he'd probably decide
he's better off pleading guilty.

31:35.080 --> 31:38.840
Really?
Oh, that is a very likely outcome.

31:39.000 --> 31:42.560
The more determined you are
to stand up in court,

31:42.720 --> 31:45.720
the more likely it is
you won't have to.

31:45.840 --> 31:47.200
How's that for a win-win?

31:57.080 --> 31:59.040
Do you know
what I was doing there?

31:59.200 --> 32:01.520
Bringing the integrity of
the office into disrepute?

32:01.680 --> 32:03.640
Indulging in grossly unethical
misconduct.

32:03.760 --> 32:05.120
She'd pulled out of the trial!

32:05.280 --> 32:07.920
I heard, but you can't be the one
to make her change her mind.

32:08.080 --> 32:10.520
Tony, please, I can't just hope
that Lina gets it done.

32:10.680 --> 32:13.760
Well, you won't have to.
I've... I've spoken to Maya.

32:13.920 --> 32:16.760
And?
Well, she's thinking about it.

32:17.760 --> 32:20.560
You can't bend the rules, not
with David leading the defence.

32:20.720 --> 32:22.320
If he gets wind of
the slightest grounds

32:22.440 --> 32:23.800
for abandoning this trial,

32:23.920 --> 32:25.760
he won't hesitate.

32:31.120 --> 32:32.840
Thanks.

32:44.840 --> 32:46.880
How'd it go?
She couldn't come in later?

32:47.040 --> 32:50.120
Ah, no, it had to be nine.
But she's agreed to go to trial.

32:50.240 --> 32:52.480
Great. Good work.

32:52.640 --> 32:54.160
Mm.
Wouldn't have been easy.

32:54.320 --> 32:58.400
Well, Tony helped. Tony?
Why the hell did he get involved?

33:00.520 --> 33:04.600
Lina?
So Janet couldn't.

33:06.440 --> 33:09.360
Right. Let's get to work then,
shall we?

33:13.600 --> 33:15.640
You know, you can call Owen
a lot of things,

33:15.800 --> 33:17.320
but one thing he's not
is stupid.

33:17.440 --> 33:18.320
Yeah.

33:18.480 --> 33:20.840
Now, he might have a secret plan
to get Nelson off,

33:21.000 --> 33:22.760
but he can't be seen
to be doing that.

33:22.920 --> 33:24.640
At the same time,
he's got to look like

33:24.800 --> 33:26.200
he's going for
an all-out conviction.

33:26.360 --> 33:28.880
But if he is going all-out,
it'll look the same.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.880
It's...

33:31.000 --> 33:32.360
This is doing my head in.

33:32.520 --> 33:34.600
The closer I look at Owen,
the more cracks I've found.

33:34.760 --> 33:37.120
For example, as a young constable
in the Drugs Squad

33:37.280 --> 33:40.400
he managed to own two investment
properties before he turned 25.

33:40.560 --> 33:42.040
How did he get the capital
for that?

33:42.200 --> 33:44.320
Was he on-selling the drugs
that he'd impounded?

33:44.440 --> 33:45.800
I don't know yet.

33:45.960 --> 33:49.440
He was also part of a joint task
force under Steven Blakely.

33:49.600 --> 33:52.520
Managed to lock up a few bikies
for dealing in,

33:52.680 --> 33:55.920
get this, rocket launchers
and ammonium nitrate.

33:56.080 --> 33:58.400
Has he kept up contact?
I don't know.

34:01.080 --> 34:03.560
Now, look,
you've got protection 24/7.

34:03.720 --> 34:05.560
Nothing's going to happen to you
in the DPP.

34:05.720 --> 34:07.560
You just keep doing
what you're doing.

34:07.720 --> 34:09.520
I'll take care
of everything else.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.360
OK, evidence in chief,

34:16.520 --> 34:18.360
areas we need more detail,
order of the offences.

34:18.480 --> 34:20.280
What have we forgotten?

34:20.440 --> 34:22.080
Did you get on to Drew?
Yeah.

34:22.239 --> 34:24.600
But he's pretty reluctant.
Can you explain it to him?

34:24.760 --> 34:27.480
How's it going? We're looking
pretty good, I think.

34:27.600 --> 34:29.239
What are we doing about a deal?

34:29.400 --> 34:31.080
That'll come from the cops,
won't it?

34:31.239 --> 34:32.520
I mean,
now we've got Maya back,

34:32.679 --> 34:35.120
won't they going to sit Nelson down
and explain the facts of life?

34:35.239 --> 34:36.600
Or you could take the initiative.

34:36.800 --> 34:39.639
Best time for me to say anything
will be half an hour
before we start.

34:39.800 --> 34:42.280
No, I don't agree. I know David.
Well, you can't talk to him.

34:42.400 --> 34:43.760
We can agree on that at least.

34:43.920 --> 34:45.760
Maybe. But on the other hand,
he's still a friend.

34:45.920 --> 34:47.840
He's a silk and you're a witness
for the prosecution.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.159
If you tell him about how
you got together with Maya

34:50.320 --> 34:52.360
and why Nelson better take
a deal or else,

34:52.520 --> 34:54.679
he'll get the whole thing
called off before lunchtime.

34:58.840 --> 35:01.160
OK. Just don't leave it
to the last second.

35:01.320 --> 35:03.160
David responds
to negotiating time.

35:03.320 --> 35:04.840
Who wants a negotiation?
He will.

35:04.960 --> 35:06.080
I don't.

35:06.240 --> 35:08.240
He'll wanna talk Nelson around,
make him see sense,

35:08.360 --> 35:09.640
feel like he's won something...

35:09.800 --> 35:11.560
The only time this'll be real
for Keith Nelson

35:11.720 --> 35:13.240
is the last few minutes
before it starts.

35:13.400 --> 35:15.640
That's when he'll think, 'Shit.
This is real. What if I lose?'

35:15.800 --> 35:17.440
At that point,
when he's staring at the abyss,

35:17.560 --> 35:18.760
that's when a deal looks great.

35:18.920 --> 35:20.560
When he hasn't got time
to review his options?

35:20.680 --> 35:21.840
Who wants to give him options?

35:21.960 --> 35:23.120
When a guy's drowning,

35:23.280 --> 35:24.560
you don't start discussing
the relative merits

35:24.720 --> 35:26.720
of a pool buoy compared
to a life vest or driftwood.

35:26.880 --> 35:29.400
You say, 'Hey, schmuck, you can
drown or take what you're given.'

35:29.560 --> 35:31.320
That's our best chance.
Not with David.

35:31.480 --> 35:33.720
With anybody!
Owen, don't be so bloody-minded.

35:33.880 --> 35:36.560
Please, just give him a day or two.
I know it'll work out better.

35:36.680 --> 35:38.040
Janet, fuck off!

35:38.200 --> 35:41.000
I'm sick of you trying
to run this case.

35:42.080 --> 35:44.840
I bet 100 bucks you made sure
Maya came in this morning.

35:44.960 --> 35:46.600
Am I right?

35:48.160 --> 35:49.400
Thank you.

35:49.520 --> 35:50.920
And then when she did come in,

35:51.080 --> 35:53.000
Tony had to make sure
you didn't fuck everything up.

35:53.160 --> 35:55.040
And now you're trying to cut
a deal with Nelson?

35:55.160 --> 35:56.200
And you know why!

35:56.360 --> 35:59.040
I'm not running this prosecution
to find out who bombed your car.

35:59.160 --> 36:01.200
If we do, that's great.

36:01.360 --> 36:03.800
But this is about Maya,
it's not about you.

36:05.080 --> 36:07.640
It's my job. Let me do it.

36:19.400 --> 36:21.280
Make sure about Drew.

36:26.800 --> 36:28.000
Fuck!

36:33.080 --> 36:34.840
Don't you think Maya'd be
a lot happier

36:35.000 --> 36:36.440
if she just dropped
the whole thing?

36:36.600 --> 36:39.080
No, not in the long run.
I do.

36:39.240 --> 36:42.680
Well, she won't, so wouldn't
you rather help her?

36:42.800 --> 36:43.880
How?

36:44.040 --> 36:45.680
The stronger the case is
against Nelson,

36:45.800 --> 36:47.440
the more likely he'll settle.

36:47.600 --> 36:50.000
That's why we need you.
I don't make it any stronger.

36:50.160 --> 36:51.840
Yes, you do.
Why? How?

36:52.000 --> 36:54.840
What can I say? I didn't see
or hear him do anything.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.920
Wouldn't I just be a stronger
witness for him?

36:57.080 --> 36:59.560
You validate the opportunity.
What?

36:59.680 --> 37:01.520
Keith Nelson is saying

37:01.680 --> 37:03.480
that the whole first weekend
never happened,

37:03.640 --> 37:05.800
but according to Maya,
they babysat you and her

37:05.960 --> 37:07.720
while your Mum and Dad
had a weekend away.

37:07.880 --> 37:10.800
But Keith Nelson says
they were there the whole time.

37:10.960 --> 37:13.240
And without you,
we have no independent evidence

37:13.360 --> 37:15.200
to support what Maya's saying.

37:15.360 --> 37:17.040
You don't?
No.

37:17.200 --> 37:19.320
She says one thing,
they say another.

37:19.440 --> 37:21.000
But you told the police

37:21.160 --> 37:22.840
that weekend alone with them
did definitely happen.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.400
Yeah.
And that's crucial.

37:24.520 --> 37:26.840
That's why Maya needs you.

37:28.640 --> 37:30.640
Right. I see. This is so...

37:34.040 --> 37:35.240
I'll do it.

37:37.320 --> 37:40.000
For Maya's sake.

37:41.360 --> 37:42.560
Thanks.

37:53.440 --> 37:54.920
Thought I'd give you
an update on

37:55.080 --> 37:57.480
how Owen got a deposit
for those two apartments.

37:57.640 --> 38:00.280
He's on the payroll of
an international drug cartel?

38:00.440 --> 38:04.480
No, no, he was a youngster,
put into a surveillance room

38:04.640 --> 38:08.560
and had to listen for hours
on end to phone conversations.

38:08.720 --> 38:10.280
Anyway, he overheard
that someone had a horse

38:10.440 --> 38:13.360
and they were fixing a race
so it could chalk up a win.

38:13.520 --> 38:16.800
Put his life savings on it without
telling anyone. Cleaned up.

38:16.960 --> 38:20.720
So, he's an opportunist?
Oh, well, he was back then.

38:20.880 --> 38:24.520
But not a real player?
I don't really want to say.

38:24.680 --> 38:26.560
I mean, when you look at
the overall picture,

38:26.720 --> 38:28.880
there's still questions that
have to be answered.

38:29.040 --> 38:31.600
We still haven't proven Blakely
and Moreno knew each other.

38:31.720 --> 38:33.040
What about Renmark's USB?

38:33.200 --> 38:35.520
Were any of the photos taken
at Blakely's beach house?

38:35.680 --> 38:37.840
No, they were all from overseas
as far as I know.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.680
I only saw a handful.
Pretty awful, really.

38:41.840 --> 38:44.680
I know that whenever we do
catch 'em, they just say,

38:44.800 --> 38:46.400
'Oh, we just love children'.

38:46.560 --> 38:48.920
In their eyes it's not about
dominance or power.

38:49.040 --> 38:50.400
They just love them.

38:50.560 --> 38:52.680
But if it was up to me,
fucking castration.

38:52.800 --> 38:53.840
Very tempting.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.960
Then you look at the internet now,
there's nothing you can't get.

38:57.080 --> 38:57.960
Yeah.

38:58.120 --> 39:00.000
When I was a kid,
my mother said to me,

39:00.160 --> 39:02.160
'Giacomo, don't take lollies
from strangers.'

39:02.320 --> 39:04.680
That was it. There was nothing
else I had to worry about.

39:04.840 --> 39:08.000
I hope you listened to her.
She made sure I did.

39:08.160 --> 39:10.480
And if I didn't, it was bed,
no dinner.

39:10.600 --> 39:11.880
Harsh.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.080
Yeah. She loved me.

39:15.240 --> 39:18.440
I bet she's really proud
of what her boy's achieved.

39:18.600 --> 39:22.400
Yeah. I don't envy you,
you know,

39:22.560 --> 39:25.280
bringing up twins in this world.
It's...

39:27.480 --> 39:29.000
I'm not at the moment.

39:29.120 --> 39:31.360
No, and that's why I'm here -

39:31.520 --> 39:34.720
just to reassure you
that everything's going to be OK.

39:39.920 --> 39:41.600
Yeah.

39:56.840 --> 39:59.080
David, quick word?

39:59.200 --> 40:01.680
Please let me handle this.

40:05.640 --> 40:08.560
Let me guess, you'd like to
drop all the charges?

40:08.680 --> 40:10.040
No, I'm just wondering

40:10.200 --> 40:11.480
how your client's feeling
about things?

40:11.600 --> 40:12.720
Anxious, but confident.

40:12.880 --> 40:15.440
He doesn't want to change his plea?
Not a chance.

40:15.600 --> 40:16.920
He does know jail's
a real possibility?

40:17.040 --> 40:18.360
Maya will be very convincing.

40:18.520 --> 40:20.840
Is she? Come on, think about
your client for a second.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.600
Ten years, two years,
there's a big difference.

40:22.760 --> 40:24.280
My client maintains
his innocence

40:24.440 --> 40:25.920
and he'll be vigorously
defending...

40:26.080 --> 40:28.600
Bullshit. He's into little girls
and has been for decades.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.640
His friends in high places
can't get him out of this

40:30.760 --> 40:32.040
no matter what he thinks.

40:32.200 --> 40:34.520
No jury's going to believe him
over Maya and Drew together.

40:34.680 --> 40:36.120
Well, that remains
to be discovered.

40:36.280 --> 40:37.760
David, if you were
doing your job properly,

40:37.920 --> 40:39.360
you'd make him see
what he's facing

40:39.520 --> 40:42.080
and make him understand his only
faint hope of getting off lightly

40:42.240 --> 40:45.040
is to tell us what he knows
about others like himself.

40:45.200 --> 40:47.040
If you're talking about me,
I'm right here.

40:47.160 --> 40:48.880
Please, it's alright.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.280
What's happening? Is this it?

40:51.440 --> 40:53.720
Yes. If they walk in together,
it's a plea deal,

40:53.840 --> 40:55.200
if not, the trial's on.

40:56.640 --> 40:58.480
Is this about a deal?

40:58.640 --> 41:00.800
It's OK, I haven't agreed
to anything.

41:00.920 --> 41:03.040
I will never plead guilty

41:03.200 --> 41:05.280
to this evil piece
of teenage fantasy,

41:05.400 --> 41:06.760
not for anything.

41:06.920 --> 41:08.880
You cannot prove it,
you cannot intimidate me

41:09.040 --> 41:11.560
into some sort of cowardly
confession.

41:11.680 --> 41:13.560
And for your information,

41:13.720 --> 41:16.560
I'm well aware why you don't want
to run this trial.

41:16.720 --> 41:18.800
An acquittal would hurt you
a lot this year,

41:18.920 --> 41:20.840
won't it, Mr Mitchell?

41:24.240 --> 41:26.240
- Shit.
- What does... No!

41:26.400 --> 41:28.480
You all said this...
It's never guaranteed.

41:28.640 --> 41:32.720
Thanks for the offer,
but no thanks, Owen.

41:34.840 --> 41:36.760
You ready?

41:36.880 --> 41:39.080
Let's nail this arrogant shit.

41:41.480 --> 41:43.760
Can you talk to him?
You used to work with him.

41:43.880 --> 41:45.680
Please. Please!

41:57.200 --> 42:01.080
I can't. It'll spoil everything.
We have to go with it.

42:01.240 --> 42:02.600
I'm so sorry.
No, I can't.

42:02.760 --> 42:04.360
Maya...
No, I can't do it!

42:04.480 --> 42:05.760
Good morning, Maya.

42:05.880 --> 42:07.480
It's been a long time.

42:13.680 --> 42:15.280
You hate him, don't you?

42:17.560 --> 42:20.440
Just keep hating him.

42:23.360 --> 42:26.120
OK?
Yeah.

42:28.800 --> 42:30.920
Maya, how old were you
the first time

42:31.080 --> 42:32.880
Mr Nelson first visited
your bedroom?

42:34.520 --> 42:35.720
Seven.

42:35.880 --> 42:37.640
Could you speak up for the court,
please?

42:37.760 --> 42:39.560
I was seven.

42:39.720 --> 42:41.320
And why was Mr Nelson
in the house?

42:42.880 --> 42:46.560
He and his wife
were taking care of us.

42:46.720 --> 42:48.920
My parents were away
for the whole weekend.

42:49.080 --> 42:52.120
Was this a regular occurrence?
What?

42:52.280 --> 42:54.840
Being looked after by Mr Nelson
and his wife?

42:57.760 --> 43:00.160
Could you speak up for the court
a little bit, please?

43:00.280 --> 43:02.280
Yes.

43:02.440 --> 43:04.360
Can you describe for us
what happened

43:04.480 --> 43:06.440
when he came into the room?

43:09.760 --> 43:12.200
He sat on the edge of my bed

43:12.360 --> 43:15.520
and he asked me why I still
had the light on,

43:15.680 --> 43:18.840
and I told him that
I was scared of the dark

43:19.000 --> 43:21.040
and that I always kept
the light on.

43:21.200 --> 43:23.960
And then he said
that he would show me

43:24.120 --> 43:26.520
that there was nothing
to be afraid of.

43:26.640 --> 43:28.360
And then what happened?

43:30.080 --> 43:35.280
Well, then he turned off the light
and it... it was so dark,

43:35.440 --> 43:37.760
and he took me by the hand
and he squeezed it...

43:39.600 --> 43:45.080
..squeezed it really tight
and he told me that I was brave.

43:45.200 --> 43:47.000
But I didn't feel very brave.

43:47.120 --> 43:49.160
Then he lifted up the doona

43:49.320 --> 43:51.800
and he rolled into the bed
next to me,

43:51.960 --> 43:54.800
and he said that he would stay
there for a while

43:54.920 --> 43:58.440
until I got used to the dark,

43:58.560 --> 44:00.080
stopped feeling scared.

44:00.240 --> 44:04.120
And we stayed like that
for quite a long time.

44:06.480 --> 44:08.480
I didn't like it.

44:10.440 --> 44:13.560
He was big and he smelled weird.

44:17.280 --> 44:19.280
And he was breathing
really heavily.

44:19.440 --> 44:22.800
It's like all I could hear
was this breathing.

44:26.080 --> 44:28.400
And then he put his hand
on my tummy.

44:30.680 --> 44:33.960
He said that it would make me
calm

44:34.120 --> 44:37.880
and that it would, um,
stop the butterflies in there.

44:38.040 --> 44:40.280
And he laughed
when he said that,

44:40.440 --> 44:42.840
but I didn't think
it was very funny.

44:46.120 --> 44:49.720
And then slowly...

44:49.840 --> 44:53.400
..really, really slowly,

44:53.560 --> 44:55.840
almost as if it wasn't even
happening,

44:55.960 --> 44:59.800
he... he moved his hand down

44:59.920 --> 45:03.760
into the front of my pyjamas.

45:06.040 --> 45:07.960
Right down.

45:08.080 --> 45:11.200
His hand was hot and big.

45:11.320 --> 45:13.800
It was like, um...

45:13.920 --> 45:15.720
It was like a giant paw.

45:15.840 --> 45:18.320
And I couldn't move

45:18.480 --> 45:21.480
because on one side of me
was the wall,

45:21.600 --> 45:23.520
and he was on the other side.

45:23.680 --> 45:26.000
I was sure that
if I stayed really still,

45:26.120 --> 45:28.040
he might just go away.

45:29.640 --> 45:31.120
But he didn't.

45:33.720 --> 45:37.880
He put his fingers inside me.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.880
Too many of them.

45:43.680 --> 45:45.160
And I got tears in my eyes.

45:45.320 --> 45:47.600
I remember them rolling down
the back of my throat,

45:47.760 --> 45:49.360
and I was scared
I was going to...

45:51.680 --> 45:54.960
I was scared I was going to cough,
or make a noise.

45:57.400 --> 46:03.640
I was just so sure that
if I stayed perfectly still

46:03.760 --> 46:05.600
and really quiet, it would...

46:08.440 --> 46:11.840
..it would be just like
I wasn't there.

46:17.360 --> 46:20.960
Did Mr Nelson ever do this
to you again?

46:24.080 --> 46:28.960
Yep. It wasn't always the same,
though.

46:29.080 --> 46:32.480
Sometimes it was, um...

46:35.760 --> 46:38.440
..it was worse.

46:39.800 --> 46:42.000
OK. Let's go through them
one by one,

46:42.120 --> 46:44.000
as many as you can remember.

47:09.600 --> 47:11.080
You right for tomorrow?

47:12.360 --> 47:15.600
Sure. Did Maya finish?
Yep.

47:15.760 --> 47:17.680
Sinclair only asked
three or four questions,

47:17.800 --> 47:19.160
so you're first up, then Drew.

47:26.120 --> 47:27.600
Owen?

47:36.800 --> 47:39.520
I'm just trying to juggle
some appointment times tomorrow.

47:39.680 --> 47:42.320
How long do you think Janet's
going to be giving evidence for?

47:42.440 --> 47:43.800
An hour or two.

47:43.920 --> 47:45.280
She should be done by lunch

47:45.440 --> 47:48.320
unless Sinclair starts some
lengthy cross-examination.

47:48.480 --> 47:51.200
So, if we say 3pm,
that should be safe?

47:51.320 --> 47:52.480
Should be.

47:52.640 --> 47:55.120
And then how many days have been
set aside for this matter?

47:55.240 --> 47:56.480
Three or four.

47:56.640 --> 47:59.800
So, Lina should be free
next week? I hope so.

47:59.960 --> 48:02.160
Unless something unexpected
occurs.

48:03.240 --> 48:04.480
Yeah.

48:04.600 --> 48:06.120
Good.

49:06.840 --> 49:08.520
What?

49:08.680 --> 49:11.320
All those little backroom beavers
finally found something.

49:15.560 --> 49:18.040
Drew Blakely.
Yep.

49:18.200 --> 49:21.600
It was in a frame in his
old bedroom at Steve's house.

49:21.760 --> 49:23.480
So?
On the back.

49:26.280 --> 49:28.160
Moreno Photography.

49:28.320 --> 49:30.280
He's known Steve Blakely
for at least five years.

49:31.800 --> 49:35.760
Steve, what were you doing?

49:42.320 --> 49:44.800
Owen really gets under your skin,
doesn't he, Tracey?

49:44.960 --> 49:47.200
We know where he went the other
morning, that's all I'm saying.

49:47.320 --> 49:48.560
We're not judging.

49:48.720 --> 49:51.120
Where, a brothel?
Worse.

49:51.280 --> 49:53.680
A radio station?
Ah, television, actually.

49:53.800 --> 49:55.040
Television?

49:55.200 --> 49:57.280
Well, he met Karen Shaw,
journo for News in Focus.

49:57.440 --> 50:00.000
Right. Well, thanks for this
information.

50:00.120 --> 50:02.120
You didn't get it illegally?

50:02.280 --> 50:04.960
We looked at his phone's call
register.

50:05.120 --> 50:07.080
Which is not a breach
of the Digital Copyright Act.

50:07.240 --> 50:08.640
We didn't forward
to another phone.

50:08.800 --> 50:11.000
So you called Karen Shaw
and confirmed the meeting?

50:11.120 --> 50:12.000
Yes.

50:13.680 --> 50:16.800
Owen's in his office. The court
just adjourned for lunch.

50:21.680 --> 50:24.840
G'day. Things still going well
for us?

50:24.960 --> 50:26.320
Yeah, pretty good.

50:26.440 --> 50:28.360
Janet was fine.

50:28.520 --> 50:30.880
Drew on after lunch
and then it's their turn.

50:31.920 --> 50:33.600
Do you know Karen Shaw?

50:36.760 --> 50:39.480
I take it that's a yes.
Met her once or twice.

50:39.640 --> 50:42.040
Why?
Nothing important.

50:42.200 --> 50:45.520
What'd you talk to her about?
Protecting our sources.

50:45.640 --> 50:47.080
Sources of what?

50:47.240 --> 50:51.360
Listen, Tony,
let me just say that

50:51.520 --> 50:53.640
I've never given her any
information about any matter

50:53.800 --> 50:56.160
I or anyone else here is
prosecuting or has prosecuted.

50:56.320 --> 50:58.000
Well, what information
did you give her?

50:58.120 --> 50:59.480
How'd you find out I met her?

50:59.640 --> 51:02.760
Oh, don't you question me, Owen.
I'm bloody furious about this.

51:02.920 --> 51:05.040
No-one in here goes
to the press behind my back.

51:05.160 --> 51:06.720
Absolutely no-one.

51:06.840 --> 51:08.440
We are a huge target

51:08.600 --> 51:10.760
and the only way I can protect us
all, collectively

51:10.920 --> 51:13.520
and individually, is by putting
myself between those doors

51:13.640 --> 51:15.000
and all the press outside.

51:15.160 --> 51:16.920
If you want to continue
working here,

51:17.080 --> 51:19.640
in fact, if you want
to even finish this trial,

51:19.800 --> 51:22.080
you'll tell me what went on
in that meeting.

51:22.200 --> 51:24.800
No fudging, no bullshit.

51:24.920 --> 51:26.600
Why did you go to the press?

51:26.720 --> 51:29.240
Tell me now or you can fuck off!

52:07.400 --> 52:08.920
Drew, can you confirm

52:09.080 --> 52:11.200
that Mr and Mrs Nelson stayed
with you and your sister

52:11.360 --> 52:14.080
on the June long weekend
15 years ago?

52:14.200 --> 52:15.280
Yes.

52:15.440 --> 52:16.720
And they were looking
after you

52:16.880 --> 52:18.160
because your parents
were away?

52:21.080 --> 52:23.080
That was the situation,
wasn't it?

52:23.240 --> 52:26.840
Ah, no.
They were there, actually.

52:27.000 --> 52:30.800
They were in the house,
with you and Mr and Mrs Nelson?

52:31.840 --> 52:33.040
Yes.

52:33.200 --> 52:35.440
But that isn't what
you told police. No.

52:35.560 --> 52:37.360
So that evidence is a lie?

52:37.520 --> 52:39.440
Yes. But I couldn't say it
till now.

52:39.600 --> 52:42.320
I, um... I'd never want to do
anything to hurt Maya,

52:42.480 --> 52:44.600
but I have to be fair
to Mr Nelson too.

52:44.760 --> 52:47.480
Fair in what way?
Well...

52:49.800 --> 52:53.200
He wasn't the one
creeping into Maya's bedroom.

52:53.360 --> 52:55.040
It was Dad.
You liar!

52:55.200 --> 52:56.400
Order.
What are you doing?

52:56.560 --> 52:57.480
Sorry.
Order!

52:57.640 --> 53:00.200
Are you telling this court
that your sister was in fact

53:00.320 --> 53:01.480
abused by your father?

53:02.760 --> 53:04.800
Yes.
Drew, that's...

53:04.960 --> 53:07.960
Your Honour, I ask that this
witness be declared hostile

53:08.080 --> 53:09.520
and seek leave to cross-examine.

53:09.640 --> 53:11.840
Yes, I believe that you have

53:12.000 --> 53:14.160
sufficient grounds
for that request, Mr Crown.

53:14.320 --> 53:17.600
You dictated a statement
to Constable Caroline Martin

53:17.760 --> 53:20.000
on the 2nd of this month
and signed it at 8:09pm.

53:20.160 --> 53:21.480
Is that a fact?
Yes.

53:21.640 --> 53:23.560
Yet not once in this statement
did you mention

53:23.720 --> 53:25.320
that your father abused
your sister.

53:25.480 --> 53:28.080
No.
Therefore you lied, yes?

53:28.200 --> 53:30.640
Yes, but only ever for Maya.

53:30.800 --> 53:32.360
Nevertheless,
why should we believe you

53:32.480 --> 53:34.080
now you're a self-confessed liar?

53:34.240 --> 53:36.720
Who knows when you're lying?
Why would I lie about this?

53:47.080 --> 53:50.600
You and your dad
didn't get on well, did you?

53:50.720 --> 53:52.520
No.

53:52.680 --> 53:54.880
To put it bluntly,
you didn't like him.

53:55.040 --> 53:58.160
Would you, when you know what
he was doing to his daughter?

53:58.280 --> 53:59.560
But was he?

53:59.720 --> 54:01.760
Or are you using this situation
to put the boot in

54:01.880 --> 54:02.920
now he can't fight back?

54:03.080 --> 54:05.840
No, I'm stopping an innocent man
from getting convicted.

54:06.000 --> 54:07.760
Are there any other instances
of abuse

54:07.920 --> 54:09.680
you haven't told anyone
up until now?

54:09.800 --> 54:10.680
Plenty.

54:10.800 --> 54:12.120
You'd have to say that,

54:12.280 --> 54:14.120
otherwise what you've just said
wouldn't sound right, would it?

54:14.280 --> 54:16.360
He picked on me all the time.
How?

54:16.520 --> 54:18.880
What do you mean, how?
Well, what constitutes abuse?

54:21.040 --> 54:22.640
How's Owen going?

54:22.800 --> 54:25.200
Did he get angry when you didn't
put the dishes in the sink?

54:25.320 --> 54:26.600
For God's sake.

54:26.760 --> 54:29.160
Well, we haven't heard
anything yet.

54:31.200 --> 54:33.800
You know he was the one who
spread the rumour to the press

54:33.920 --> 54:35.440
about you and Erin?

54:37.440 --> 54:39.840
Prick!
Yep.

54:41.440 --> 54:44.600
And you've waited a lifetime to
get him back, haven't you, Drew?

54:45.600 --> 54:47.040
Whatever it takes.

54:48.320 --> 54:51.960
And I put it to you that's why
you'd lie about him and Maya.

54:57.720 --> 54:59.000
When I was five years old,

54:59.160 --> 55:01.000
my dad took us down to the beach
after school.

55:01.160 --> 55:03.080
But he said,
'Don't go on the rocks',

55:03.240 --> 55:05.040
because they had all these,
um...

55:05.160 --> 55:08.040
..like, oyster shells on them.

55:08.160 --> 55:10.360
Jagged, sharp things.

55:10.520 --> 55:13.120
But I was collecting pebbles
and when the tide came in,

55:13.280 --> 55:15.720
the only way back
was over the shells,

55:15.840 --> 55:18.120
so I called out for help.

55:19.920 --> 55:23.880
He just stood there.
Five. I was five years old.

55:24.040 --> 55:26.120
And every step
I cut myself more.

55:26.240 --> 55:28.360
He didn't lift a finger.

55:28.520 --> 55:31.480
He just stood there, watching me,
and it was agony.

55:31.600 --> 55:34.440
My feet covered in blood

55:34.600 --> 55:37.640
and he just stood there
and fucking watched!

55:37.800 --> 55:41.200
Mr Blakely. I'd call that
abuse, wouldn't you?

55:43.720 --> 55:46.480
When I told him I couldn't ride
my bike without training wheels,

55:46.600 --> 55:47.960
he pushed me down a hill.

55:48.120 --> 55:51.160
The feet of Blakely's corpse.
What?

55:51.320 --> 55:53.840
Whoever killed him cut up
his feet, remember?

55:57.440 --> 55:59.440
What more proof do you need?

56:07.320 --> 56:10.240
Renmark wasn't my mate.
Was he in on the scoop too?

56:10.400 --> 56:13.000
Both have a good laugh
about the big lesbian scandal?

56:13.160 --> 56:16.000
You ever do anything like that again,
I'll make sure you lose your job.

56:16.160 --> 56:18.320
I called you on your mobile.
You could have been anywhere.

56:18.440 --> 56:19.520
I wasn't anywhere. I was here.

56:19.680 --> 56:21.920
I do not like to be made
to look like a liar!

56:22.080 --> 56:24.280
- Danny Novak!
- Get away from the table...
- What are you doing?

56:24.400 --> 56:26.440
Let him go!

56:26.600 --> 56:28.920
Either give me something I can use
or you're wasting my time!

56:29.080 --> 56:32.040
If they know that I told you this,
they will kill me.

56:32.200 --> 56:33.760
You head straight
to the safe house.

56:33.920 --> 56:36.480
Do not call anyone, no-one,
stay there until you hear from me.

56:36.640 --> 56:38.280
Oh, thank God.

56:38.400 --> 56:39.840
Is this about...
