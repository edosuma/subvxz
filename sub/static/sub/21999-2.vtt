I'm sorry.

It's just taken me a little
while to realize that...

...I have very little
control over things.

I've probably had my

I wasn't done with you.

01:42.961 --> 01:44.922

02:19.032 --> 02:21.113
Th-they can take out the cancer?

02:21.115 --> 02:22.626
They think, maybe.

02:23.584 --> 02:25.818
Unfortunately, to do it,
they're pretty sure

02:25.820 --> 02:27.719
they're gonna have to take out
my personality.

done this for you, Bull,

you have to submit them.

of Emily Conner

04:59.039 --> 05:00.780

Uh, my client pleads
"not guilty," Your Honor.

DISTRICT ATTORNEY: Your Honor,
the young man already admitted

05:05.746 --> 05:08.113
to the EMTs on the scene
that he injected the drugs

05:08.115 --> 05:09.338
- that killed Ms. Conner.
- ADAM'S LAWYER: Your Honor,

05:09.363 --> 05:10.415
he had no attorney present

05:10.417 --> 05:11.249
when he said those things.

05:11.274 --> 05:12.272
DISTRICT ATTORNEY: Which
is why the district attorney

05:12.274 --> 05:13.226
is recommending no bail at this time.

05:13.228 --> 05:14.978
Shut the DA down and ask for bail.

05:14.980 --> 05:17.399
He's 18 years old, Your Honor.
His girlfriend just died.

05:17.401 --> 05:20.058
Obviously. That's why
we're here. He killed her.

05:20.060 --> 05:21.693
Shut the DA down. Ask for bail.

student, a good kid.

- You okay?

05:43.151 --> 05:45.183
ADAM'S LAWYER: Obviously,
everything happened very quickly,

05:45.185 --> 05:46.551
so, uh, there was,

05:46.553 --> 05:48.220
wasn't time to pursue, uh,

05:48.222 --> 05:49.721
other options, in terms of...

05:49.723 --> 05:52.224
Uh, Your Honor, we'd like
to ask for a time-out.

05:52.226 --> 05:53.604
JUDGE FOLEY: A what?

05:53.606 --> 05:55.697
A time-out? Wait a second.

05:55.699 --> 05:58.263
Uh, who are you? And who's he?

05:58.265 --> 06:01.700
Uh, he is the defendant's new counsel.

06:01.702 --> 06:04.202
(QUIETLY): At least for the time
being, if you're smart.

06:04.204 --> 06:05.937
And I'm the guy who put him up to it.

06:05.939 --> 06:07.406
What are you doing?

06:07.408 --> 06:09.074
Trying to get your boy out on bail,

06:09.076 --> 06:10.675
which, trust me, is what you want.

06:10.677 --> 06:12.010
He's not built for prison.

We don't have any money.

Your Honor, Ms. District Attorney,

06:18.952 --> 06:21.019
I apologize for the disruption,

06:21.021 --> 06:22.199
but Mr...

06:24.391 --> 06:26.358
(CLEARS THROAT) Harris.

06:26.360 --> 06:29.628
Mr. Harris has had
a sudden change of counsel.

06:29.630 --> 06:32.417
May I approach? Discuss bail?

bond company doesn't screw them.

06:43.944 --> 06:45.811

06:45.813 --> 06:47.746
of a couple good lawyers.

06:47.748 --> 06:48.725
Any thoughts?

06:49.950 --> 06:53.118
You're thinking about the ones
that'll work for free, right?

06:54.955 --> 06:56.955
All right, everything looks good.

06:56.957 --> 06:58.356
I'm not gonna lose my house, am I?

06:58.358 --> 06:59.591
Not unless your son

06:59.593 --> 07:01.293
doesn't show up for court. No.

07:01.295 --> 07:03.829
More importantly,
your son is here, home.

07:03.831 --> 07:06.765
Where he is safe and we can,
uh, work on his defense.

07:06.767 --> 07:08.133
Help him find a lawyer.

07:08.135 --> 07:09.334
Any chance you two...?

07:09.336 --> 07:12.571
You know, it's not really what we do.

07:12.573 --> 07:14.039
We're not really a law firm.

07:14.041 --> 07:16.308
DOUG: I don't know.
You guys were pretty good

07:16.310 --> 07:17.306
- in court this morning.
- Yeah.

07:17.308 --> 07:18.710
SALLY: Please, please, call me back.

07:18.712 --> 07:19.878
I really think we need to talk.

07:22.127 --> 07:24.111
Well, that was a bad idea.

07:24.113 --> 07:26.985
- What's that?
- I was trying to catch Dawn again.

07:26.987 --> 07:29.087
If she would just get
on the phone with me,

07:29.089 --> 07:31.256
I think we could talk this
through, mother to mother.

07:31.258 --> 07:32.858
The victim's mother?

07:32.860 --> 07:34.626
Yeah. Mrs. Harris,
you can't call her again.

07:34.628 --> 07:35.927
In fact, I don't want you calling anyone

07:35.929 --> 07:37.129
without running it by me first.

07:37.131 --> 07:39.598
So you mean you are gonna help us?

07:41.840 --> 07:46.338
No. I mean until we help you...
find... someone.

07:46.340 --> 07:48.373
Is Adam here?

07:48.375 --> 07:50.375
I'd love to talk to Adam.

08:00.954 --> 08:03.054
Can I give you a couple tips?

08:03.056 --> 08:04.593
About basketball?

08:05.125 --> 08:07.292
No. Not about basketball.

08:07.294 --> 08:09.561
About where you are
and what you're doing.

08:11.498 --> 08:13.632
First off, my name is Dr. Bull.

08:13.657 --> 08:16.624
And a pretty good icebreaker between us

08:16.649 --> 08:18.049
would be, "Hey, Dr. Bull.

08:18.074 --> 08:20.508
Thanks for keeping me out of
prison today."

08:27.507 --> 08:28.906
So are you my new lawyer?

08:28.931 --> 08:31.198
No. I'm nobody's lawyer.

08:31.223 --> 08:32.589
I'm not a lawyer.

08:32.719 --> 08:34.419
I'm just a guy who's trying to help you.

08:34.421 --> 08:37.222
So what about that other guy?
Is he my lawyer?

08:38.759 --> 08:40.325
No. We can't. I can't.

08:40.350 --> 08:42.116
Look. I'm not here to talk about me.

08:42.140 --> 08:43.674
I'm here to talk about you.

08:44.215 --> 08:46.364
You want to tell me what happened?

08:47.801 --> 08:50.001
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

08:56.543 --> 08:59.277
- Okay.
- (BALL SLAPPING ON PAVEMENT)

08:59.279 --> 09:01.279
Let's talk about Emily.

09:01.281 --> 09:03.248
She must've really hated you.

09:07.906 --> 09:09.788
What are you talking about?

09:09.790 --> 09:11.723
Well, look at the predicament
she put you in.

09:11.725 --> 09:14.492
Is that what people think?
That she did this to me?

09:14.494 --> 09:16.895
What are people supposed to think?

09:16.897 --> 09:18.230
It's either that or you killed her.

09:18.232 --> 09:19.250
No.

09:20.901 --> 09:23.088
She didn't know it was
gonna happen this way.

09:23.770 --> 09:26.383
She didn't plan on me
pushing the plunger.

09:27.460 --> 09:29.827
She didn't even know
I was gonna be in the room.

09:30.043 --> 09:33.011
She... actually tried
to get me to leave.

09:34.214 --> 09:36.281
So you didn't get her the fentanyl?

09:36.935 --> 09:39.184
Was that the stuff she injected?

09:40.747 --> 09:43.681
The whole suicide part,
that was a surprise to me.

09:43.757 --> 09:45.393
She asked me to help her

09:45.395 --> 09:48.029
sneak out of the hospital
and have some fun.

09:49.096 --> 09:50.762
She was going crazy in there.

09:50.764 --> 09:52.530
How did that make you feel?

09:52.532 --> 09:54.285
I was so happy.

09:56.204 --> 09:58.289
I hadn't heard from her in months.

09:59.039 --> 10:02.252
I'd been texting her and e-mailing her,

10:02.277 --> 10:05.632
but she didn't want to see me.

10:09.075 --> 10:12.086
Right after she got sick,
I saw her one more time.

10:13.387 --> 10:15.186
We took a ride upstate.

10:15.188 --> 10:16.433
But then she just...

10:17.809 --> 10:19.352
shut me off.

10:21.479 --> 10:23.231
It was like we were never a couple.

10:24.298 --> 10:25.650
(CRYING): It was like...

10:31.104 --> 10:33.471
Adam, get in here, will ya?

10:33.473 --> 10:35.907
I'm getting pneumonia
just looking at ya.

10:39.994 --> 10:43.114
Adam. I need you to get in here with me.

10:43.116 --> 10:47.886
Adam, I'm trying to help you
here. Get in the garage with me.

10:47.888 --> 10:50.088

Hey, Adam, can we ask you
some questions?

10:55.095 --> 10:57.028
- Maybe.
- Adam.

12:48.187 --> 12:50.420
Stage four glioblastoma.

It's brain cancer. No known cure.

12:52.979 --> 12:54.813
She was scheduled for surgery.

13:11.398 --> 13:13.298

His father works at the power plant.

13:15.535 --> 13:17.035
Never missed a basketball game.

His parents put their life savings

13:18.472 --> 13:20.205

Nathan and Dawn Conner.

13:28.048 --> 13:30.381
Dad's a veterinarian, Mom's a CPA.

13:30.383 --> 13:31.716
When Emily got sick,

13:31.718 --> 13:35.253
Dawn quit her job
to become a full-time caregiver.

13:35.255 --> 13:37.388
Never accepted her daughter's diagnosis.

Never gave up hope
for a miracle, which...

13:40.053 --> 13:41.059
I totally get.

13:41.061 --> 13:43.061
Trick is going to be finding a jury

13:43.063 --> 13:45.396
who can put themselves in Adam's shoes.

13:45.398 --> 13:48.433
We need to make them feel
the way he felt in that moment.

13:48.435 --> 13:50.313
Does it really matter what he felt?

13:51.356 --> 13:53.104
That kid knew what he was doing

13:53.106 --> 13:54.359
with that needle,

13:54.774 --> 13:56.608
and he went through with it anyway.

13:56.610 --> 13:58.977
The way I read the law, that is murder,

13:58.979 --> 14:00.323
and he's guilty.

14:01.532 --> 14:03.915
Benny, the law is there
to protect the people,

14:03.917 --> 14:05.383
not the other way around.

14:05.578 --> 14:08.653
And remember, Emily called Adam.

14:08.655 --> 14:10.755
They hadn't spoken in
months, and it was her idea

14:10.757 --> 14:12.557
to run away from the hospital. She paid

14:12.559 --> 14:14.359
for the hotel, and according to Adam,

14:14.361 --> 14:16.027
the drugs were in her purse.

14:16.029 --> 14:16.961
He didn't even know

14:16.963 --> 14:19.397
she had them until she told him

14:19.399 --> 14:21.566
that she wanted to kill herself.

14:22.929 --> 14:25.103
Emily orchestrated the entire day,

14:25.306 --> 14:28.540
right up until the moment
that needle was in her arm.

14:28.542 --> 14:31.342
Who pushed the plunger
is beside the point.

14:31.344 --> 14:35.313
The intent was hers, and hers alone.

14:36.116 --> 14:37.949
And intent is what

14:37.951 --> 14:40.687
the law demands for a finding of murder.

14:40.689 --> 14:42.573
That is our narrative.

14:43.156 --> 14:45.490
And that is how
we're gonna get this jury

15:23.575 --> 15:27.110
So... about the case.

15:28.786 --> 15:31.603
I have a point of view,
and I am concerned

15:31.605 --> 15:33.791
that it doesn't dovetail
with our client's.

15:34.441 --> 15:37.475
I've been a practicing Catholic
my whole life.

15:37.477 --> 15:39.047

15:40.766 --> 15:42.999
suicide's a mortal sin.

15:43.216 --> 15:44.916

No one can take a person's life,
even their own, except for God.

15:49.589 --> 15:52.357
I'm sorry, but...
that's just what I believe.

15:57.397 --> 15:59.330
Let me ask you something, Benny.

15:59.332 --> 16:02.266
Did I ever say I thought
what Adam did was right?

16:02.268 --> 16:03.488
No.

16:03.970 --> 16:05.236
'Cause it doesn't matter.

to go out and kill somebody.

16:19.386 --> 16:21.552

to go into a court of law...

16:21.554 --> 16:24.889
In fact, I'm <i> paying</i> you
to go into a court of law

16:24.891 --> 16:28.426

- I apologize on his behalf.
- BENNY: No, no, no.

16:36.069 --> 16:38.356
No, no. No-no apologies necessary.

16:38.805 --> 16:42.173
The kid has a right
to a vigorous defense.

16:42.175 --> 16:44.342
I just don't want to hinder that

16:44.344 --> 16:47.412
because my own personal
moral code conflicts with his.

16:47.414 --> 16:48.646

16:48.648 --> 16:50.782
that you will mount
an even more vigorous defense,

you're sitting in right now
suddenly broke.

20:59.565 --> 21:01.065
Would it be your fault?

21:01.994 --> 21:03.434
I'm not sure I understand your question.

21:03.436 --> 21:04.702
Well,

21:04.704 --> 21:05.970
the chair appeared to be fine,

21:05.972 --> 21:07.438
you sat in it, it broke.

21:07.440 --> 21:08.639
Are you to blame?

21:08.641 --> 21:11.253
Well, yeah, I guess I would be?

21:11.587 --> 21:13.577
Well, who else's fault would it be?

21:13.579 --> 21:15.112
And another one bites the dust.

21:15.114 --> 21:16.913
You are running out of options.

21:16.915 --> 21:19.367
I don't know. Maybe the chair
was old, defective.

21:19.369 --> 21:21.686
Bingo. An evolved thinker.

21:21.688 --> 21:23.454
Just because he broke the chair

21:23.456 --> 21:26.143
doesn't necessarily mean it's his fault.

21:28.466 --> 21:31.434
Juror number three is acceptable
to the defense, Your Honor.

21:31.459 --> 21:33.593
Very well, then. We have our jury.

21:33.618 --> 21:35.684

21:40.640 --> 21:41.806
I don't understand.

21:41.808 --> 21:43.798
How is any of this
supposed to be helping me?

21:43.800 --> 21:45.710
You just have to trust him, Adam.

21:45.712 --> 21:48.045
This is where the man lives.

21:54.373 --> 21:55.672
That's her mom.

21:55.697 --> 21:57.497
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)

21:58.791 --> 22:00.057
Adam, let's go this way.

22:00.059 --> 22:01.459
No, I need to say something.

22:01.461 --> 22:03.060
Adam, that's not a good idea.

22:03.062 --> 22:04.598
Mr. and Mrs. Conner.

22:08.334 --> 22:09.767
I'm so sorry.

22:10.020 --> 22:12.336
I loved Emily so much.

22:12.773 --> 22:14.859
I miss her so much.

22:15.708 --> 22:17.174
I'm so sorry.

22:17.176 --> 22:18.654
You're sorry?

22:19.979 --> 22:22.446
You should be dead. Not her.

22:22.448 --> 22:23.414
You.

22:23.416 --> 22:24.615
Come on, Dawn. Not here.

22:24.617 --> 22:25.716
You're the drug user.

22:25.718 --> 22:27.385
You gave her those drugs,

22:27.387 --> 22:28.622
didn't you?

22:29.756 --> 22:31.055
- Didn't you?
- You are gonna walk this way

22:31.057 --> 22:32.656
and not say another word. Let's go.

22:32.658 --> 22:35.192
We didn't even get to say good-bye!

22:35.194 --> 22:37.194
You took that from us!

22:37.196 --> 22:39.196
You murderer!

22:39.198 --> 22:42.133
(SOBBING)

22:54.990 --> 22:56.609
BULL: Did you give her the drugs?

22:57.059 --> 22:58.625
You mean, were they mine?

22:58.627 --> 23:00.237
You know what I mean.

23:00.596 --> 23:01.947
Of course not.

23:02.631 --> 23:04.131
I'm not a druggie.

23:04.133 --> 23:05.826
It's not my thing.

23:09.578 --> 23:10.706
So...

23:12.741 --> 23:15.275
what was that
between you and Emily's mom

23:15.277 --> 23:16.629
at the courthouse?

23:17.112 --> 23:18.589
Sophomore year...

23:19.448 --> 23:20.925
tore my ACL.

23:21.582 --> 23:24.136
The doctor prescribed
hydrocodone, and...

23:25.346 --> 23:26.847
I liked it.

23:29.958 --> 23:31.291
You seek treatment?

23:31.293 --> 23:32.812
Treatment? (SCOFFS)

23:33.896 --> 23:35.762
Told my dad.

23:35.764 --> 23:37.358
He flushed everything down the toilet.

23:40.602 --> 23:42.905
The only other person I told was Emily.

23:43.781 --> 23:45.439
And she told her parents,

23:45.441 --> 23:47.174
and now you're gonna hear about it

23:47.176 --> 23:49.176
from the witness stand.

23:49.178 --> 23:51.144
They're gonna get some expert to explain

23:51.146 --> 23:54.181
fentanyl and hydrocodone
are both opioids.

23:54.183 --> 23:57.918
Then they'll speculate that you
began abusing your medication.

23:57.920 --> 24:01.488
And when you couldn't
get another refill, well...

24:01.799 --> 24:03.824
you bought it off the street.

24:04.176 --> 24:06.720
So when your girlfriend
decided to kill herself,

24:07.162 --> 24:09.096
you knew right where to go.

24:09.098 --> 24:10.297
But none of that's true.

24:10.299 --> 24:11.498
And we'll object, but the jury

24:11.500 --> 24:12.732
will have already heard it.

24:12.734 --> 24:14.801
And the people who are inclined
to believe that story

24:14.803 --> 24:16.689
are probably gonna believe it anyway.

24:18.315 --> 24:20.107
Put me on the stand.

24:20.109 --> 24:22.409
They'll know it's the truth
if they hear it from me.

24:22.411 --> 24:23.410
That's not gonna happen.

24:23.412 --> 24:25.045
Not while I'm running the show.

24:25.047 --> 24:26.947
First question the prosecution
is gonna ask you

24:26.949 --> 24:28.582
is "Did you inject those drugs?"

24:28.584 --> 24:30.217
And you're gonna answer, "Yes, I did."

24:30.219 --> 24:31.718
And then nobody, from that point on,

24:31.720 --> 24:33.120
is gonna hear a word you say.

24:33.122 --> 24:35.522
And unless there is
an earth-shattering reason

24:35.524 --> 24:37.724
to put you on that stand, I am...

24:44.215 --> 24:45.732
Look at me.

24:46.902 --> 24:48.435
Did I say game over?

24:48.437 --> 24:50.055
Did I say we were defeated?

24:50.672 --> 24:52.606
They may have more points
on the board, but...

24:52.608 --> 24:54.187
the game is far from over.

24:54.189 --> 24:55.175
Don't patronize me.

24:55.177 --> 24:56.610
You don't get a name like Bull

24:56.612 --> 24:58.478
because you give up
before the game is over.

24:58.480 --> 24:59.773
What are you talking about?

25:00.415 --> 25:02.582
That's your name.
You were born with that.

25:03.485 --> 25:05.112
Maybe I was.

25:05.554 --> 25:07.220
Maybe I wasn't.

25:07.573 --> 25:09.322
Maybe I just made it up.

25:09.324 --> 25:10.323
Maybe it's just a tool

25:10.325 --> 25:12.092
I came up with to help me win.

25:12.094 --> 25:13.787
I'll do anything to win.

25:14.429 --> 25:16.429
Game's not over, champ.

25:26.542 --> 25:28.808
Bull? What can I do for you?

25:30.412 --> 25:31.978
I want ice.

25:31.980 --> 25:33.246
Ice.

25:33.248 --> 25:34.514
As in, drink?

25:34.516 --> 25:36.783
At 4:25 in the afternoon?

25:36.785 --> 25:38.185
I knew never should have gotten you

25:38.187 --> 25:40.887
that box set of <i>Mad Men</i> for Christmas.

25:40.889 --> 25:42.274
Well...

25:42.891 --> 25:45.736
the trial starts tomorrow.

25:46.328 --> 25:48.328
We got a defendant who's
convinced we can't win,

25:48.330 --> 25:49.863
a lawyer who's convinced
he's going to hell

25:49.865 --> 25:51.164
and no murder weapon.

25:51.166 --> 25:53.033
Okay, I'm sorry,

25:53.035 --> 25:55.101
what do you mean, murder weapon?

25:55.103 --> 25:56.336
The fentanyl.

25:56.338 --> 25:58.872
We don't know
how Emily got the fentanyl.

25:58.874 --> 26:01.608
And until we do,
the jury is going to think

26:01.610 --> 26:02.876
that she got it from Adam.

26:02.878 --> 26:04.611
Well, I know Cable gave Danny a lead

26:04.613 --> 26:06.546
on someone in Emily's support group.

26:06.548 --> 26:09.182
A girl who lives upstate.
Someone Emily was talking to

26:09.184 --> 26:11.551
every single day until
about five months ago.

26:11.553 --> 26:14.354
Danny's hoping maybe she
can tell us something.

26:14.356 --> 26:17.090
There's also going on
between Emily's parents.

26:17.092 --> 26:18.358
It's not just grief.

26:18.360 --> 26:19.603
There's some kind of...

26:20.095 --> 26:21.661
disconnect.

26:21.663 --> 26:22.862
I saw it at the courthouse.

26:22.864 --> 26:25.865
I can ask Cable do a
deep dive on their e-mails

26:25.867 --> 26:28.235
and texts... see what she can find.

26:28.237 --> 26:29.603

You're not really worried...

26:32.174 --> 26:33.617
are you?

26:35.711 --> 26:37.413
You know, when I was a kid,

26:38.180 --> 26:41.081
when I'd screw up, get in trouble...

26:41.083 --> 26:43.085
make bad choices...

26:44.052 --> 26:46.171
my grandfather would say to me...

26:47.956 --> 26:50.123
"There's a good man in there somewhere.

26:50.125 --> 26:53.193
We just got to keep you alive
till you're 26."

26:53.195 --> 26:54.722
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

26:55.797 --> 26:57.099
That kid.

26:57.799 --> 26:59.966
And the way he loved that girl.

27:01.903 --> 27:04.137
The fact he was willing to step in

27:04.139 --> 27:06.442
at that moment
when she needed him, and...

27:07.443 --> 27:09.476
damn the consequences.

27:12.247 --> 27:13.907
There's a good man in there.

27:15.450 --> 27:17.517
GOODMAN: <i>The defense
is gonna tell you that</i>

27:17.519 --> 27:19.986
Adam Harris had no idea

27:19.988 --> 27:21.388
what was going to happen

27:21.390 --> 27:23.292
when he entered the hotel room.

27:23.992 --> 27:25.892
But I'm going to tell you the truth.

27:25.894 --> 27:28.461
About a boy who harassed his ex

27:28.463 --> 27:31.298
with texts and e-mails for months.

27:31.300 --> 27:33.533
Who finally convinced her

27:33.535 --> 27:35.168
to leave the hospital

27:35.170 --> 27:38.305
so he can have sex with her
in a sleazy hotel.

27:38.307 --> 27:41.094
So they can do drugs together.

27:41.096 --> 27:43.967
Something he has a sordid history with.

27:44.746 --> 27:46.079
And you know the rest.

27:46.565 --> 27:48.081
Things got out of hand.

27:48.525 --> 27:50.950
And one of them ended up dead.

27:51.361 --> 27:52.852
That's the real story.

when it comes to narcotics

28:00.128 --> 28:02.529
at that hospital. There's no way
Emily got it there.

28:02.531 --> 28:05.231
Huh. Any progress with mom and dad?

28:06.802 --> 28:08.001
You were right.

28:08.003 --> 28:09.769
Emily's dad has been
texting another woman

28:09.771 --> 28:12.505
for the past few months,
and, from what I can tell,

28:12.507 --> 28:14.741
not telling his wife about it.

28:14.743 --> 28:16.676
It might be an affair.

28:16.678 --> 28:19.312
But I honestly don't see
how it's relevant.

28:19.314 --> 28:20.747

Uh, she came here once, with a boy,

29:11.733 --> 29:13.433
to visit Ava.

Ava'd just had a surgery,
she wanted to surprise her.

But... I think that was the only
time they ever met face-to-face.

29:19.641 --> 29:21.274

they just stopped communicating.

Well, given his specialty
in the field, I'll allow it.

31:09.232 --> 31:11.892
Well, a cure certainly isn't...

31:11.894 --> 31:13.394
impossible.

BENNY: Dr. Muller,

31:25.909 --> 31:28.709
Emily's tumor was in her
frontal lobe, is that correct?

31:28.711 --> 31:31.078
- It was.
- And the frontal lobe controls what,

31:31.080 --> 31:33.587
uh, memory, language, emotion?

31:33.589 --> 31:35.116
Yes, that's right.

31:37.854 --> 31:39.242
These three things.

31:40.189 --> 31:42.823
They-they're.. they're kind of
the essence of who we are,

31:42.825 --> 31:44.525
wouldn't you say?

31:44.527 --> 31:46.327
Now, would the surgery

31:46.329 --> 31:48.195
have permanently damaged

31:48.197 --> 31:50.364
or altered that essence?

31:52.348 --> 31:55.950
A dramatic change in personality
is a common side effect, yes.

31:55.975 --> 31:57.675
And how did Emily feel about that?

31:57.774 --> 32:00.274
She expressed her concern about that.

32:00.276 --> 32:02.209
Did she ever say
she didn't want the surgery?

32:02.211 --> 32:03.512
Well, she was a minor, so...

32:03.514 --> 32:05.782
Just a yes or no answer, please.

32:06.916 --> 32:07.993
Yes.

32:10.286 --> 32:11.585
BENNY: Let's talk about this cure

32:11.587 --> 32:13.187
- you mentioned earlier.
- Well, I

32:13.189 --> 32:15.389
didn't actually say there was a cure.

32:15.391 --> 32:17.958
I just... acknowledged the possibility

32:17.960 --> 32:19.694
that one could be found.

32:19.696 --> 32:21.696
But, realistically speaking,

32:21.698 --> 32:24.231
that possibility is pretty slim,

32:24.233 --> 32:26.901
considering Emily's time frame,
wouldn't you say?

32:26.903 --> 32:30.938
I mean, there isn't something
that's on the brink

32:30.940 --> 32:33.607
that you're aware of, is there?

32:34.371 --> 32:36.390
No. Not to my knowledge.

32:36.415 --> 32:38.296
And let's just say...

32:38.381 --> 32:39.747
let's say we did find

32:39.749 --> 32:42.116

32:42.118 --> 32:43.451

32:47.323 --> 32:48.658
wanted to cut out?

32:49.258 --> 32:51.492
Is there some sort of procedure

32:51.494 --> 32:52.993
or medicine that we could use

32:52.995 --> 32:54.334
to grow that back?

32:54.336 --> 32:56.263
No. Of course not.

I thought you might want to know
I figured out who the woman was

33:21.391 --> 33:22.890
who Emily's dad was texting.

33:22.892 --> 33:24.959
Turns out it was a therapist.

33:24.961 --> 33:29.196
A therapist specializing
in end-of-life treatment.

33:29.198 --> 33:32.333
From what I can tell,
the mom wasn't even aware.

33:32.335 --> 33:34.602
So that's the wedge between 'em.

33:34.604 --> 33:37.138
Emily's dad was taking her
to a therapist,

33:37.140 --> 33:39.874
and he was keeping it a secret
from his wife.

33:39.876 --> 33:41.336
Why?

33:41.878 --> 33:44.478
Because he knew
what his daughter really wanted?

33:45.590 --> 33:47.014
Which means, on some level,

33:47.016 --> 33:48.552
he sympathized with her.

33:49.344 --> 33:51.719
But he couldn't tell his wife.

33:51.721 --> 33:53.854

It wasn't just Adam who had her back.

Of course.

34:31.311 --> 34:33.472
It was, like, six months ago.

She had just gotten sick.

34:37.726 --> 34:42.187
I mean, you couldn't see it,
but she told me about it.

34:42.188 --> 34:44.289
Anyway, uh, she wanted

34:44.291 --> 34:46.860
to visit this girl who lived upstate.

34:47.293 --> 34:49.393
This girl who had the same thing she had

came back 15 minutes later.

35:02.419 --> 35:05.545

Ladies and gentlemen of the

38:23.910 --> 38:27.378
I've had my doubts about this
case from the very beginning.

38:27.380 --> 38:29.999
See, I'm a... I'm a Catholic.

38:30.414 --> 38:32.750

I simply didn't agree

38:32.752 --> 38:34.213
with what Emily did.

38:34.215 --> 38:35.505
And today...

38:36.022 --> 38:37.257
I still don't.

38:39.392 --> 38:42.011
But... that's the thing.

38:43.063 --> 38:45.964
It's not about what she did.

38:46.141 --> 38:47.976
It's about what Adam did.

38:48.702 --> 38:50.702
So let's review.

38:50.704 --> 38:52.570
She invited him to the hospital,

38:52.572 --> 38:54.072
so we can't charge him with that.

38:54.074 --> 38:55.840
And she got the hotel room,

38:55.842 --> 38:57.742
so that's not on him, either.

38:57.744 --> 39:01.112
And we're reasonably sure that
she procured the drugs, so...

39:01.114 --> 39:03.848
Adam isn't guilty there, either. So...

39:05.368 --> 39:07.585
...what is Adam guilty of?

39:10.523 --> 39:13.057
Maybe being 18?

39:13.059 --> 39:17.962
Maybe loving Emily too much to
see her suffer against her will?

39:19.499 --> 39:21.799
Emily's death was a tragedy.

with this terrible disease.

And...

39:27.140 --> 39:29.225
Emily made a decision.

Now, whether you agree
with that decision or not,
