Previously on Gilmore Girls:

00:03.337 --> 00:05.506
The person who buys the basket
wins the company...

00:05.589 --> 00:07.508
of the person who makes
the basket for lunch.

00:07.591 --> 00:10.802
Basket, basket maker.
Guy who didn't bring enough money.

00:10.886 --> 00:12.262
You think this is funny?

00:12.346 --> 00:15.265
You know what I'm going through
at work? I am being phased out.

00:15.349 --> 00:16.892
- What's going on?
- Dean's on his way.

00:16.975 --> 00:18.393
Rory doesn't want him to find me.

00:18.644 --> 00:21.271
- Jess just came by to bring me some food.
- From Luke's.

00:21.355 --> 00:22.606
Rory wouldn't lie, right?

00:22.689 --> 00:24.858
Suddenly, I heard myself resign.

00:24.942 --> 00:27.444
No, Rory wouldn't lie.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.074

00:39.039 --> 00:40.832
- Mom?
- No.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.585
- We're starving.
- We're waiting for your father.

00:43.669 --> 00:46.004
- It'll get cold.
- We're waiting for your father.

00:46.088 --> 00:48.423
- We've been waiting forever.
- We have not.

00:48.507 --> 00:49.675
Godot was just here, he said:

00:49.758 --> 00:53.303
'I ain't waiting for Richard,'
grabbed a roll and left. It's been forever.

00:53.387 --> 00:55.222
When we gather as a family,
we eat as one.

00:55.305 --> 00:58.308
We don't eat in shifts, you know that,
and so does Richard.

00:58.392 --> 01:01.562
- When did he get that antique car?
- A couple of horrible weeks ago.

01:01.645 --> 01:03.522
What happened to that oil-painting hobby?

01:03.605 --> 01:07.276
When he couldn't foresee rivaling Cézanne
he lost interest...

01:07.359 --> 01:09.528
so he bought that car. Lorelai!

01:09.695 --> 01:12.322
Mom, it's not dinner.
It's just my private stash.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.700
It's eating, and we're not eating.

01:14.950 --> 01:18.704
You're bound by the rules of the
Geneva Convention just like everyone else.

01:18.745 --> 01:21.373
- No one told me it was Casual Friday.
- Hello, everyone.

01:21.456 --> 01:22.457
You haven't started?

01:22.541 --> 01:25.085
We were waiting for you.
I thought you were almost done.

01:25.169 --> 01:27.045
I was, but this car has a mind of its own.

01:27.087 --> 01:30.048
As I turned to leave,
it began spraying a green solution at me.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.425
- Yuck.
- Yuck, indeed.

01:31.508 --> 01:34.511
- Go on, start, no sense in waiting for me.
- Coolness.

01:34.595 --> 01:35.929
- Stop.
- Gomer said...

01:36.013 --> 01:37.639
We are waiting for you, Richard.

01:37.723 --> 01:40.309
In 35 years, I have never started
a dinner without you...

01:40.392 --> 01:42.227
unless you were out of town or ill.

01:42.269 --> 01:44.396
Elsa, take everything away
and keep it warm.

01:44.479 --> 01:48.525
Now please go upstairs and get ready
so we can all enjoy a nice family dinner...

01:48.609 --> 01:49.568
together.

01:50.319 --> 01:53.238
- I'll be right back.
- Right back, Dad.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.866
Change on the way upstairs,
make it a navy shower...

01:55.949 --> 01:58.744
quick soap, quick rinse,
and no excessive posing.

01:59.161 --> 02:00.329
Hungry.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.973
- Hey, there. Anywhere?
- Anywhere you want.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.394
- Could you move, please?
- What?

03:05.477 --> 03:09.690
- Anywhere where there's no people.
- Like I'm a mind-reader. I was just joking.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.526
- That's funny.
- What?

03:13.151 --> 03:16.071
Something's different here,
something's changed.

03:16.154 --> 03:18.490
- Impossible.
- No, I swear, there's something.

03:18.532 --> 03:21.118
I'd be very disappointed
if something changed in here.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.369
Why are you so anti-change?

03:22.452 --> 03:25.163
- Because most change sucks.
- That's true, it does.

03:25.247 --> 03:26.915
- The chalkboard.
- What about it?

03:28.542 --> 03:30.043
That is brand-new.

03:30.127 --> 03:31.628
A new special?

03:31.795 --> 03:34.798
His four-slice French toast
has been up there since I was born.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.925
- You have to let that go.
- What can I get you?

03:37.009 --> 03:38.552
- You have a new special.
- I sure do.

03:38.635 --> 03:41.180
- Nice, what is the special omelette?
- You won't like it.

03:41.263 --> 03:42.264
How do you know?

03:42.347 --> 03:44.224
I know what you like, you won't like it.

03:44.308 --> 03:47.102
- Can I hear what it is?
- It's three eggs with bits of bacon...

03:47.186 --> 03:48.145
I like bacon.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.522
Cubed tomatoes, Swiss cheese,
and a dash of oregano.

03:50.606 --> 03:52.524
- A dash, he says.
- I've got other customers.

03:52.608 --> 03:55.444
I'm gonna go with the special omelette,
with a side of bacon.

03:55.527 --> 03:57.613
- There's bacon in the omelette.
- Skip the bacon.

03:57.696 --> 03:59.781
- The side of bacon?
- The bacon in the omelette.

03:59.865 --> 04:03.202
Can I get Jack cheese instead of Swiss?
Swiss is so stringy.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.453
Fine, Jack cheese.

04:04.536 --> 04:07.748
I think I'm allergic to oregano,
so hold that, too. And some coffee.

04:07.831 --> 04:10.292
So just the eggs, tomatoes,
and Jack cheese.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.461
- Not too many tomatoes.
- Light on the tomatoes.

04:12.544 --> 04:15.631
Very light, just a teeny, tiny amount,
practically none.

04:15.714 --> 04:18.550
I'm skipping the tomatoes.
It's an omelette with Jack cheese.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.344
- You did this on purpose.
- Did what?

04:20.427 --> 04:21.887
French toast for me.

04:23.889 --> 04:25.849
- That was cruel.
- I know.

04:25.933 --> 04:28.769
Look how hard he worked on that sign
and everything.

04:28.936 --> 04:32.523
Look at the handwriting.
It's so precise, so determined.

04:32.606 --> 04:33.607
It's Focused Luke.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.859
- That's Jess's handwriting.
- Really?

04:35.984 --> 04:37.903
How do you know Jess's writing?

04:37.986 --> 04:40.239
I lent him a book,
and he wrote some stuff in it.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.740
He vandalized one of your books?

04:41.823 --> 04:45.118
He didn't vandalize it, he wrote
in the margins, thoughts and stuff.

04:45.202 --> 04:48.121
What, like, 'play basketball,
eat a sandwich,' stuff like that?

04:48.205 --> 04:50.999
No, like margin stuff.

04:51.083 --> 04:52.835
People like Mark Twain wrote in margins.

04:52.918 --> 04:54.962
'Pilot a steamboat,
write Huckleberry Finn. '

04:55.045 --> 04:58.257
- Forget it.
- No, I'm sure margin writing is common.

04:58.340 --> 05:01.009
You didn't tell me Dean was joining us.

05:01.093 --> 05:02.052
Hi.

05:03.428 --> 05:06.098
- What are you doing here?
- I just dropped by to say hello.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.392
- How'd you know we were here?
- You're always here.

05:08.475 --> 05:12.104
- We're not always here.
- Do you want to eat with us, Dean?

05:12.229 --> 05:16.441
- Rory, is that okay?
- Yes, you don't have to ask.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.153
We're three.

05:20.237 --> 05:21.947
I did the math. You gonna eat something?

05:21.989 --> 05:24.616
Sure, yeah, I'll take the special omelette.

05:24.658 --> 05:27.369
- You put him up to this?
- No, I did not.

05:27.452 --> 05:29.413
- You don't know what's in it.
- I'm not picky.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.290
- You'll send it back after I make it?
- No.

05:31.373 --> 05:34.209
Right, I'll come back when
I've got time for this.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.086
What was that all about?

05:36.170 --> 05:39.423
I think it was a little something
in your attitude, mister.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.052
So is everything in the materials
clear to everyone?

05:44.136 --> 05:45.137
Pretty much.

05:45.220 --> 05:46.638
Were we reading these now?

05:46.722 --> 05:49.641
Yeah, that's why we've all been quiet
for the past 10 minutes.

05:49.725 --> 05:51.977
I thought it was, like,
prayer time or something.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.020
Good grief.

05:53.103 --> 05:54.646
- I'm still reading mine.
- What?

05:54.730 --> 05:56.315
I read slow so I don't miss anything.

05:56.398 --> 05:57.691
It's not the Bhagavad-Gita.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.902
It's simple instructions
for the business fair.

05:59.985 --> 06:02.905
- Someone's not taking to Elba too kindly.
- What does that mean?

06:02.988 --> 06:05.657
Rory's the leader of this group, Napoleon,
and you're not.

06:05.741 --> 06:08.577
Excuse me, leader, you want to lead here?
You've got anarchy.

06:08.660 --> 06:10.120
I'm just enjoying the show.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.414
Hi, I think this is my group.

06:12.498 --> 06:15.000
- Brad, hey.
- You remember me.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.835
- Of course I do.
- Cool.

06:16.919 --> 06:19.254
- So you're back at Chilton now.
- Yeah.

06:19.338 --> 06:22.174
My psychiatrist convinced my parents
I should face my fears...

06:22.257 --> 06:24.885
instead of running away.
My rabbi agreed, so here I am.

06:24.968 --> 06:27.179
Nice to have you back. Take a seat.

06:32.142 --> 06:33.352
Paris?

06:35.646 --> 06:38.357
- Her name is Paris, right?
- Brad, let me catch you up here.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.734
There's going to be a
business fair in three weeks.

06:40.817 --> 06:43.153
Each group has to come up
with a consumer product...

06:43.237 --> 06:44.738
- for high-school kids.
- Neat.

06:44.821 --> 06:47.658
So we pick our product
and we make a prototype of it.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.952
Then we use our imaginary
million-dollar budget...

06:50.035 --> 06:52.204
to mass-produce, market, and distribute it.

06:52.287 --> 06:54.873
- And we'll present all of this at the fair.
- Cool.

06:54.957 --> 06:58.001
Brad, your festive interjections
are a real kick in the pants...

06:58.085 --> 06:59.878
but we're low on time, so can it.

06:59.920 --> 07:03.590
That's it. In two days, we're going
to reconvene and pitch product ideas.

07:03.674 --> 07:07.177
- Class dismissed?
- We haven't discussed business advisors.

07:07.261 --> 07:10.472
Right, we're supposed to get a parent
who's in business to advise us.

07:10.556 --> 07:11.557
Anyone score?

07:11.640 --> 07:13.767
My dad's got scheduling conflicts
up the wazoo.

07:13.851 --> 07:15.561
- No for Chip.
- My dad's in Hong Kong...

07:15.644 --> 07:17.563
but he can video-conference in, if need be.

07:17.646 --> 07:19.398
- No for Paris.
- My dad's traveling.

07:19.481 --> 07:21.483
My dad's in court for the next six weeks.

07:21.567 --> 07:22.734
- Lawyer?
- Defendant.

07:22.776 --> 07:23.819
We won't pry.

07:23.902 --> 07:25.571
I have no idea what he's up on anyway.

07:25.612 --> 07:28.699
- No one's mom works?
- Working moms are so 90s.

07:28.782 --> 07:32.035
My mom works. She's a curator
at the Hartford Natural Museum.

07:32.119 --> 07:36.748
We need experienced business advisors,
not someone who poses animal carcasses.

07:36.915 --> 07:38.667
- What about your mom?
- My mom?

07:38.750 --> 07:42.421
- That's right, she runs a hotel.
- It's just an inn, a small inn.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.590
- It's still a business.
- She must keep books.

07:44.673 --> 07:46.300
Yeah, but they're really small books.

07:46.383 --> 07:50.721
It's not perfect, but it's a better option
than Brad's mom, the buffalo stuffer.

07:50.846 --> 07:53.265
She doesn't stuff the animals.
That's taxidermy.

07:53.307 --> 07:55.893
Who is this rabbi
that encouraged you to come back here?

07:55.934 --> 07:58.353
Give me his address,
I'm gonna go pop him one.

07:58.437 --> 08:00.564
Hold it, I don't think my mom
is right for this.

08:00.647 --> 08:03.525
You need to do whatever it takes
to make it happen.

08:03.609 --> 08:05.527
Otherwise you shouldn't be
the group leader.

08:05.611 --> 08:09.072
- A coup d'état, how exciting.
- There's no coup d'état.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.949
- I'll ask her.
- Good.

08:13.327 --> 08:15.704
30, 31, 32.

08:15.787 --> 08:17.789
- Sookie, look.
- 33, 34, 35.

08:17.873 --> 08:19.583
Can't look. Making meringue.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.752
- 37. Fine science.
- You got a package.

08:21.835 --> 08:26.173
- 39, got to count to 40. Can't over-whip.
- I think it's your wedding invitations.

08:26.423 --> 08:29.176
Gimme, I got to see them.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.345
You're gonna love these.

08:31.428 --> 08:34.640
They're pearly white
with this beautiful lavender strip.

08:34.890 --> 08:39.144
I'm gonna choke somebody by the neck
until brains ooze out of their ears.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.980
- What? They're beautiful.
- The name, look at the name.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.274
'... the marriage of his daughter
Susie St. James. '

08:44.358 --> 08:46.485
- Who's Susie St. James?
- I think it's you.

08:46.527 --> 08:48.403
- What am I going to do?
- It can be changed.

08:48.487 --> 08:51.156
- These have to go out in a week.
- We're calling right now.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.242
I am so not a Susie.

08:53.325 --> 08:57.246
- Good morning. Beautiful morning.
- It sucks from where I'm sitting.

08:57.329 --> 08:59.832
Lorelai, you remember I have
tomorrow afternoon off.

08:59.915 --> 09:03.085
- I remember. Big plans?
- Yes, my mother is coming to visit.

09:03.168 --> 09:05.671
Hello, yes.
Customer service, please. Thanks.

09:05.796 --> 09:07.130
- Sorry.
- About what?

09:07.172 --> 09:10.676
- You said your mother's coming.
- But I'm excited, I never get to see her.

09:10.759 --> 09:13.262
I must be projecting.
Your mother's coming for a visit!

09:13.345 --> 09:15.472
- She's coming for three days.
- She staying here?

09:15.556 --> 09:18.141
- No, she stays with me, of course.
- In your tiny place?

09:18.183 --> 09:21.895
She's fine with it, we stay up all night
gabbing and watching movies.

09:21.979 --> 09:25.148
- We have a ball.
- Wow, I can't wait to meet her.

09:25.190 --> 09:29.152
Hello, we have a problem with
some wedding invitations we ordered.

09:29.361 --> 09:32.239
- Okay, they're transferring me.
- I heard that.

09:32.322 --> 09:34.658
He is really happy
about his mother coming to visit.

09:34.741 --> 09:37.035
- I heard that, too.
- Totally foreign to me.

09:37.119 --> 09:40.497
Hi, great.
I'm going to pass you over to my friend...

09:40.581 --> 09:42.875
who has a problem
with some merchandise she ordered.

09:42.958 --> 09:44.001
Hold on one sec.

09:44.042 --> 09:45.043
Listen to me.

09:45.127 --> 09:48.130
I have experience dealing
with people who screwed something up.

09:48.213 --> 09:51.800
You have a better chance
if you don't get all hysterical.

09:51.884 --> 09:53.135
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:54.386 --> 09:57.222
How dare you do this to me?
You're ruining my wedding.

09:57.306 --> 09:59.057
It's the most important day of my life.

09:59.099 --> 10:02.644
It's my life, not 'Susie St. James. '
Are you listening to me?

10:02.728 --> 10:04.521
- Good girl.
- You'd better be listening.

10:04.605 --> 10:06.732
No, you be quiet and listen.

10:06.815 --> 10:07.900
Hi.

10:07.983 --> 10:09.860
Thought you couldn't get here till later.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.237
Our meeting didn't go as long
as I thought it would.

10:12.321 --> 10:16.366
Lucky for me, more work for you.
Here, chronological order, please.

10:16.450 --> 10:18.869
- How was your day?
- I got an 'A' on my Physics test...

10:18.952 --> 10:22.498
finished Candide, and convinced a boy
that Paris wouldn't attack his rabbi.

10:22.581 --> 10:24.541
- So, uneventful.
- Pretty much.

10:24.958 --> 10:28.295
Mom, I know
you'll probably not want to do this...

10:28.378 --> 10:30.839
Yes, I will,
unless it's something I don't want to do.

10:30.923 --> 10:34.092
Do you want to be the parent advisor
on my Economics project?

10:34.176 --> 10:36.595
- Rory, gosh.
- I'm kind of in a spot.

10:36.637 --> 10:37.971
- No one else can do it?
- Nope.

10:38.055 --> 10:39.515
- You checked, double-checked?
- Yes.

10:39.598 --> 10:42.768
And no one else can do it,
so you came slumming after me?

10:42.851 --> 10:44.520
- Of course.
- I appreciate that.

10:44.603 --> 10:47.314
- I'm totally stuck.
- If you're stuck, I'll do it.

10:47.397 --> 10:50.901
What about your grandfather,
retired business titan?

10:50.984 --> 10:52.611
- What about him?
- He'd be perfect.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.071
This is a business project...

10:54.112 --> 10:57.824
and the word 'business' has been taboo
in that house since he left the firm.

10:57.908 --> 11:00.160
Asking him might remind him of that
and upset him.

11:00.244 --> 11:02.246
Or he'll be thrilled
that you thought of him.

11:02.287 --> 11:04.790
You're not saying that
because you don't want to do it?

11:04.873 --> 11:07.292
No, I really think he would enjoy
helping you.

11:07.376 --> 11:11.922
Then I wouldn't have to feel guilty about
being so reluctant to help you out myself.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.675
- All right, I'll give it a shot.
- Good girl.

11:15.759 --> 11:17.261
Would you really have felt guilty?

11:17.344 --> 11:20.138
No, but I would have felt guilty
about not feeling guilty...

11:20.222 --> 11:21.682
and that could go on forever.

11:21.765 --> 11:23.934
Miss Gilmore in the vicious circle.

11:28.438 --> 11:31.817
- Hey, Grandpa.
- Rory, this is a surprise.

11:31.900 --> 11:34.319
I was just in the area,
and I thought I'd pay a call.

11:34.361 --> 11:35.696
How very Continental of you.

11:35.779 --> 11:39.283
I would hug you, but I have various forms
of viscous fluid on my clothing.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.034
- I'll take a rain check.
- Very good.

11:41.118 --> 11:44.413
- How's she running?
- She's a bit obstinate today.

11:44.496 --> 11:46.623
- Girls can get that way.
- Indeed.

11:46.915 --> 11:48.542
So, you were in the neighborhood.

11:48.625 --> 11:51.336
Yeah, and I actually
have a little favor to ask you.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.088
Ask away.

11:53.547 --> 11:57.384
There's this project at school,
and it's for my Economics class.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.386
- Good subject. Pragmatic.
- Yeah.

11:59.469 --> 12:03.098
And we have to come up with
a consumer product, all make-believe...

12:03.348 --> 12:07.102
and there's sort of a contest at the end,
and we sort of need an advisor.

12:07.186 --> 12:11.023
- An advisor.
- Someone who's experienced in business...

12:11.064 --> 12:13.859
who can come to a few meetings,
make suggestions.

12:13.901 --> 12:17.863
I totally understand if you can't do it,
but I just thought I would ask.

12:18.071 --> 12:21.366
I'm not sure how much help I could be.

12:21.533 --> 12:23.952
I've never actually created
a consumer product.

12:24.036 --> 12:26.038
That's okay. We kids haven't either.

12:26.121 --> 12:27.789
Yes, I suppose you haven't.

12:27.873 --> 12:31.210
If you can't do it or if you don't
want to do it, I totally understand.

12:31.293 --> 12:34.338
Things are a little bit hectic right now.

12:34.755 --> 12:37.591
- Yeah, I know.
- And it is short notice, after all.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.134
Very short.

12:39.218 --> 12:41.094
You know what? Forget I even asked.

12:41.178 --> 12:44.389
- Rory, I didn't know you were here.
- Hi, Grandma.

12:44.473 --> 12:47.559
- You didn't hug your grandfather, did you?
- I took a rain check.

12:47.643 --> 12:51.188
- I better go.
- You just got here, we have cookies.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.607
No, thank you.
Mom's expecting me at the inn.

12:53.690 --> 12:57.152
Grandpa, really, don't worry about it.
I just thought I would ask.

12:57.236 --> 12:59.738
- I'm fine, Rory. Thank you for asking.
- Bye.

13:00.614 --> 13:02.074
Ask what? What did she ask?

13:02.157 --> 13:04.576
Something for Economics class.
It's nothing really.

13:04.660 --> 13:07.663
That doesn't sound like nothing.
What about her Economics class?

13:07.746 --> 13:12.209
No, Emily, she merely asked me
to participate in some project at school...

13:12.251 --> 13:14.336
- and I respectfully declined.
- You declined?

13:14.419 --> 13:16.672
- Leave it, Emily.
- Why would you decline?

13:16.755 --> 13:18.924
Let's talk about it later, Emily. I'm busy.

13:19.007 --> 13:22.344
Busy? You've been poking around
that stupid engine for three weeks...

13:22.427 --> 13:24.805
and all it does is spray at you.
You're not too busy.

13:24.888 --> 13:28.517
I am in the middle of something,
and I don't expect you to understand it.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.436
- You're not going to help her?
- Can we talk about this later?

13:31.520 --> 13:33.772
- I never thought I'd see the day...
- What day?

13:33.814 --> 13:36.942
...Richard Gilmore would
disappoint his granddaughter like this.

13:37.025 --> 13:40.654
- Emily, please.
- Is this how it's going to be from now on?

13:40.737 --> 13:41.864
What are you talking about?

13:41.947 --> 13:43.907
I just want to know
what to expect from you...

13:43.991 --> 13:46.201
because the bouncing
from one thing to another...

13:46.285 --> 13:49.121
the moping in silence in your den,
all of that I accepted...

13:49.163 --> 13:51.165
but your turning your back on Rory...

13:51.248 --> 13:52.958
I did not turn my back on her.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.752
You adore that little girl.
She means everything to you.

13:55.836 --> 13:57.546
- Emily.
- Are you that lost?

14:00.883 --> 14:04.344
I'm incredibly disappointed
in you, Richard.

14:10.726 --> 14:13.812
- Sales.
- It's just a stupid test.

14:13.896 --> 14:16.440
'Lane Kim, you have shown
a genuine aptitude for sales. '

14:16.523 --> 14:17.608
It doesn't mean anything.

14:17.649 --> 14:19.902
'Ma'am, I see you're eyeing
the new Whip-o-Matic.

14:19.985 --> 14:21.403
'This baby's right off the truck.

14:21.486 --> 14:22.779
'If you're looking something...

14:22.821 --> 14:25.824
'to fulfill your whipping needs,
you've come to the right place.

14:25.908 --> 14:26.909
'As Devo says:

14:26.992 --> 14:29.912
'If there's a problem, you must whip it'
with a Whip-o-Matic. '

14:29.995 --> 14:31.497
You are good. I'll take two.

14:31.580 --> 14:34.333
I don't want to be in sales.
I want to do something cool.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.251
- Sell refrigerators.
- You're not funny.

14:36.335 --> 14:39.254
You are taking this aptitude test
way too seriously.

14:39.338 --> 14:41.465
It's the fourth time it's come up 'sales. '

14:41.507 --> 14:43.634
In 10 years,
we will be having lunch in Paris...

14:43.717 --> 14:45.928
and we'll not be discussing
if you made your quota.

14:46.011 --> 14:48.430
- So I'm gonna be a sucky salesman?
- Changing subject.

14:48.514 --> 14:49.848
Hey.

14:49.932 --> 14:52.142
- How are you?
- I'm only as good as my last sale.

14:52.226 --> 14:54.186
- She's lost her mind.
- Got it.

14:54.228 --> 14:57.147
- So what are you doing?
- We're going to buy some shoes.

14:57.231 --> 15:00.025
- And pick up a job application.
- You will now face the wall.

15:00.067 --> 15:02.861
After you're done shoe-shopping,
come by my softball game.

15:02.945 --> 15:06.490
You haven't been to a game in a while.
You said you missed seeing them.

15:06.573 --> 15:09.076
I do, but, I thought we were
getting together tonight.

15:09.159 --> 15:11.870
- We are.
- I should finish my Philosophy homework.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.956
- Do it at the game.
- My homework?

15:14.039 --> 15:16.792
Doesn't that defeat the point
of going to see you play?

15:16.875 --> 15:19.169
You can't glance up
in between nihilistic theories?

15:19.253 --> 15:21.380
- I can, but what's the point?
- What?

15:22.047 --> 15:26.885
Why don't I do my homework at home,
and I will go see you play next week?

15:27.344 --> 15:30.264
- I promise I'll be there.
- Okay, sure.

15:30.347 --> 15:32.850
- Great. So tonight?
- I'll be by at 7:00.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.726
Okay, so have a good game.

15:34.810 --> 15:38.355
Do that pointing-to-the-outfield thing,
it's always very popular.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.609
- Bye, Lane.
- Come again soon.

15:46.822 --> 15:50.492
Here, and here. Cleaning supplier, there.

15:51.869 --> 15:54.746
Here, staff insurance forms.

15:54.788 --> 15:56.582
Initial here. Date it here.

15:56.623 --> 15:57.624
And I just...

15:57.708 --> 16:01.295
You just okayed the vaccination of all
those filthy ducks in the south pond.

16:01.378 --> 16:03.755
- Very nice.
- Yes, a regular Dr. Dolittle.

16:07.217 --> 16:09.595
You are gorgeous. Come.

16:14.016 --> 16:17.227
What are you doing here?
I was going to pick you up at the airport.

16:17.311 --> 16:19.521
- You wicked creature.
- I had to come early.

16:19.605 --> 16:24.443
I wanted to buy presents before I see you.
I know you are a materialistic vulture.

16:24.568 --> 16:26.028
All right, back up.

16:26.904 --> 16:28.322
Thank God I have the perfect son.

16:28.405 --> 16:31.074
If you had been ugly,
I don't know what I would have done.

16:31.158 --> 16:33.285
- Boarding school?
- In Switzerland.

16:33.368 --> 16:36.121
Lorelai, this is my mother, Giselle.

16:36.163 --> 16:37.623
It's very nice to meet you.

16:37.706 --> 16:40.834
- My God, those eyes, are they real?
- Yes, they are.

16:41.960 --> 16:45.589
God is terribly cruel to bestow those eyes
and that face to one person.

16:45.631 --> 16:47.716
I'm sorry, can you be my mom, too?

16:47.799 --> 16:50.761
- I'm going to show her around, okay?
- Make sure you see Sookie.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.387
- Why?
- She wants to meet your mom.

16:52.471 --> 16:55.766
Yes, Michel, I must meet your friends.
I did not raise you to be rude.

16:55.807 --> 16:59.645
- You did too.
- No, I didn't. Come, show me off.

16:59.728 --> 17:02.064
Have you been using those free weights
I sent you?

17:02.147 --> 17:04.273
Yes, they hold down
my papers beautifully.

17:04.358 --> 17:07.903
- Lazy, silly woman.
- Cruel and vicious boy.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.489
I really appreciate
you doing this, Grandpa.

17:10.571 --> 17:11.615
Of course.

17:11.656 --> 17:14.076
I know you weren't really thrilled
with the idea.

17:14.159 --> 17:15.493
No, that's not true.

17:15.577 --> 17:18.079
I told everybody to have
their idea pitches prepared...

17:18.163 --> 17:20.082
so we can get you in and out quickly.

17:20.165 --> 17:23.752
Rory, this is an assignment.
We will give it the time it requires.

17:24.002 --> 17:27.673
- However, efficient is always best.
- I totally understand.

17:32.302 --> 17:34.888
Everyone, this is my grandfather,
Richard Gilmore.

17:34.972 --> 17:38.684
This is Louise, Madeline, Paris, Brad,
and Chip.

17:38.767 --> 17:40.561
Nice to meet you all.

17:40.644 --> 17:43.063
Do you want to say a few words
before we start?

17:43.146 --> 17:44.648
No, I'm just here to advise.

17:44.731 --> 17:47.568
I'll sit back here and observe...

17:47.651 --> 17:49.820
and advise if necessary.

17:50.821 --> 17:54.032
Okay. I guess we can start
with the idea pitches.

17:54.199 --> 17:55.951
- Who wants to go first?
- I will.

17:56.034 --> 17:57.578
Okay, Louise has the floor.

17:57.661 --> 18:00.873
I couldn't find my lip gloss this morning,
and I'd just bought it.

18:00.914 --> 18:02.624
It's the perfect shade of pink...

18:02.708 --> 18:05.169
plus it has this major shine
with minor stickiness...

18:05.252 --> 18:08.755
meaning no fear of your hair
sticking to your face when it's windy.

18:08.839 --> 18:10.174
- A coup.
- I know.

18:10.299 --> 18:14.344
Of course, 15 minutes later,
tardy and glossless...

18:14.428 --> 18:18.307
I left the house, and I had to rely on
Madeline for my source of lip color.

18:18.390 --> 18:21.518
- Not an ideal solution.
- Major skin-tone mismatch.

18:21.560 --> 18:22.936
I'm sorry, group leader...

18:23.020 --> 18:26.315
could you ask the Pigeon Sisters
if there is a point to this opus?

18:26.398 --> 18:29.234
- Louise, what's your idea?
- A lipstick LoJack.

18:29.568 --> 18:32.112
- Excuse me?
- A lipstick tracking device.

18:32.196 --> 18:34.489
You attach it to a tube,
hook it up to a remote...

18:34.573 --> 18:37.159
and the next time you're searching,
just point and shoot.

18:37.242 --> 18:38.785
I'd buy one.

18:38.869 --> 18:41.371
Okay, Louise,
that's a very interesting idea...

18:41.455 --> 18:45.083
but I think we should think of something
that appeals to both boys and girls.

18:45.167 --> 18:47.586
- Anyone else?
- Okay, I've got one.

18:47.628 --> 18:50.088
A locker robot.

18:50.130 --> 18:53.592
It would talk and tell you facts,
help you with your homework...

18:53.634 --> 18:58.222
carry your stuff, and you could fit it in
your locker until you're ready to go home.

18:59.515 --> 19:03.810
But that means that we would
actually have to build a robot.

19:03.894 --> 19:05.395
Yes, we would.

19:05.729 --> 19:08.106
- Who knows how to do that?
- I don't know.

19:08.815 --> 19:12.277
- He looks like he should know.
- I've never built a robot.

19:12.486 --> 19:14.404
But you've tried, haven't you?

19:15.239 --> 19:16.281
Yes, I have.

19:16.365 --> 19:20.786
Okay, let's just try to keep the ideas down
to things that we can actually accomplish.

19:20.828 --> 19:22.663
And I guess Paris is next.

19:23.121 --> 19:25.916
The average teenager spends
seven hours a day at school.

19:25.958 --> 19:29.002
Seven hours where he or she
is walking from class to class...

19:29.086 --> 19:31.255
indoors, outdoors, in all types of weather.

19:31.296 --> 19:35.092
At the same time, that same teenager
is going through major physical changes...

19:35.133 --> 19:36.969
within his or her own body.

19:37.094 --> 19:39.638
The combo of the action
with the environment...

19:39.721 --> 19:43.267
in addition to the hormonal imbalance
can only lead to one thing:

19:43.308 --> 19:45.477
- Accidents.
- What are you talking about?

19:45.561 --> 19:48.355
Monday morning,
Muffin wakes up and looks in the mirror.

19:48.438 --> 19:50.232
'Oh, no, I have a zit on my face.

19:50.315 --> 19:53.735
'I'll just look down when I walk
so Hunky Football Player won't notice. '

19:53.819 --> 19:57.990
And Muffin smacks right into
the cafeteria wall. That's got to hurt.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.283
Who's Muffin?

19:59.324 --> 20:01.702
This is why I'm proposing
manufacturing something...

20:01.785 --> 20:03.954
that no teenager should be without.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.623
- A first-aid kit.
- A first-aid kit?

20:06.707 --> 20:10.294
Specially designed to fit in a locker
with minimum space disruption.

20:10.377 --> 20:15.340
Band-aids, antiseptic, cotton balls,
Q- tips, ace bandages, aspirin.

20:15.674 --> 20:17.176
I don't know. It's possible.

20:17.259 --> 20:19.011
Does anyone have any questions about it?

20:19.094 --> 20:21.346
They sell these things
in every drug store, right?

20:21.388 --> 20:22.472
Yes, they do.

20:22.514 --> 20:24.808
There's also a registered nurse on campus.

20:24.850 --> 20:26.768
Her office would contain the products...

20:26.852 --> 20:28.937
- that you're talking about, correct?
- Possibly.

20:29.021 --> 20:32.691
What makes you think you could get
a young person to spend good money...

20:32.774 --> 20:37.196
on something that they could get for free,
or at least, at a lower cost?

20:37.237 --> 20:39.907
Because I know one thing
about the modern teenager.

20:39.990 --> 20:40.991
And what is that?

20:41.033 --> 20:44.036
You can get them to buy anything
if it comes in a leopard print.

20:44.119 --> 20:46.497
- True.
- We get them with style.

20:46.538 --> 20:50.083
We dress up the kits with sparkles,
colors, pictures of bands...

20:50.292 --> 20:54.087
sport themes for the boys, animal pictures
for the puppy-and-unicorn bunch...

20:54.171 --> 20:57.674
chessboards for the Bobby Fischer freaks.
A style for every taste.

20:57.758 --> 21:01.970
Plus we use neon band-aids,
pink or blue gauze for the bandages...

21:02.054 --> 21:04.056
anything that seems young
or flashy or bright.

21:04.139 --> 21:07.392
And that is how you intend to set
the business world on its ear?

21:07.434 --> 21:09.895
- That's right.
- Tricked-out first-aid kits.

21:09.978 --> 21:13.273
- For the locker.
- And you really think that's going to work.

21:13.482 --> 21:15.526
Yes. I do.

21:16.527 --> 21:18.946
- So do I.
- Really?

21:19.029 --> 21:21.573
It's perfect. It's simple,
it's easy to produce.

21:21.657 --> 21:23.617
The possibilities are endless. I love it.

21:23.700 --> 21:25.911
Well, I think we've got our product.

21:25.953 --> 21:27.871
We need to go through this point by point.

21:27.913 --> 21:29.248
Okay, let's do it.

21:29.289 --> 21:34.086
The secret to a great campaign
is a great idea. We've got that.

21:34.169 --> 21:35.921
Let's move on to finances.

21:36.004 --> 21:39.424
Do any of you have dinner plans?
We're going to be here for a while.

21:39.466 --> 21:42.261
Let's all turn to Page 4.

21:42.386 --> 21:43.637
Here we go.

21:44.763 --> 21:46.139
January projections...

21:52.938 --> 21:53.939
Mom?

21:56.650 --> 21:57.651
Hello?

21:58.777 --> 22:01.280
That ringing is not in your head,
you know?

22:01.947 --> 22:04.158
You got to read this MÖtley Crue book.

22:04.241 --> 22:07.744
I swear, you get to the point where
Ozzy Osbourne snorts a row of ants...

22:07.828 --> 22:10.205
and you think, 'It cannot get any grosser. '

22:10.289 --> 22:14.126
Then you turn the page,
and, hello, yes, it can. It's excellent.

22:14.209 --> 22:15.586
Why didn't you answer the phone?

22:15.627 --> 22:18.505
Because once you've
experienced something 5,000 times...

22:18.589 --> 22:20.841
- you need to move on.
- What are you talking about?

22:20.924 --> 22:22.259
- I knew who it was.
- Who?

22:22.301 --> 22:25.888
The person who's called the machine
so many times that I heard it sigh.

22:25.971 --> 22:28.140
- Dean?
- Dean the Determined.

22:28.307 --> 22:31.560
- Man.
- $5 says I know who that is.

22:32.477 --> 22:34.479
- Hello.
- Rory. It's your grandfather.

22:34.521 --> 22:37.107
- Hey, Grandpa.
- He did that on purpose.

22:37.191 --> 22:39.902
- I'd like to discuss tomorrow's meeting.
- Okay.

22:40.027 --> 22:42.821
- I was thinking that we should relocate.
- Midtown?

22:42.863 --> 22:44.406
- Here.
- Your house?

22:44.489 --> 22:47.451
It'll be more comfortable,
with infinitely better snacks.

22:47.493 --> 22:50.370
- Yeah, that sounds great.
- Wonderful, I'll call the group.

22:50.454 --> 22:54.458
Okay, then I guess I'll see you
tomorrow. Bye.

22:54.541 --> 22:55.584
What did he want?

22:55.667 --> 22:58.504
He wanted to move the location
of our meeting to his house...

22:58.545 --> 22:59.588
and to cost you $5.

22:59.671 --> 23:02.591
That's going well, Grandpa doing
that thing with you at school?

23:02.674 --> 23:04.343
Yeah, I think he's having fun with it.

23:04.426 --> 23:06.720
See? Did your brilliant mother
call it or what?

23:06.803 --> 23:07.804
Yes, she did.

23:07.846 --> 23:10.682
You're damn lucky to have
that woman in your life.

23:10.766 --> 23:12.976
It's whispered in my ear every night.

23:13.018 --> 23:15.562
You won't let me write it
in your underwear anymore.

23:15.646 --> 23:17.648
Check the machine
so I can erase the messages.

23:17.731 --> 23:18.815
Right.

23:23.362 --> 23:26.198
Hi, it's me. It's 4:00.
Call me when you get home.

23:27.533 --> 23:30.369
Hey, it's 4:30. I'm home. Call me.

23:31.328 --> 23:33.831
4:45. Where are you? I'll try paging you.

23:34.998 --> 23:37.501
5:30. Did you get my page?
Call with the answer.

23:37.584 --> 23:38.919
They are not all from him.

23:39.002 --> 23:41.129
I totally forgot
you were getting home at 6:00.

23:41.213 --> 23:43.715
And yet, oddly, after remembering
that information...

23:43.799 --> 23:47.427
It's 5:45 and I just thought
I'd see if you got home early.

23:47.511 --> 23:49.263
That boy would make
a good drinking game.

23:49.346 --> 23:51.265
This is crazy. Ten messages?

23:51.348 --> 23:54.059
Plus the four I took
before I stopped answering the phone.

23:54.142 --> 23:55.143
Right.

23:55.227 --> 23:57.980
Honey, ease up on that love potion
you've been giving him...

23:58.063 --> 24:01.108
or he's gonna start showing up
at David Letterman's house soon.

24:01.191 --> 24:02.901
- What's the matter?
- 14 messages.

24:02.985 --> 24:05.279
- Yeah, so, it's a little...
- It's a little too much.

24:05.362 --> 24:06.947
You guys fighting or something?

24:07.030 --> 24:08.198
What are you talking about?

24:08.240 --> 24:10.367
Did something happen
to set off the phone craze?

24:10.450 --> 24:12.828
No, everything's been fine.
Everything's been calm.

24:12.911 --> 24:14.371
No more incidents. I don't get it.

24:14.413 --> 24:17.708
If I had to guess, I would say he's
feeling insecure about something.

24:17.749 --> 24:19.209
- Why?
- Rory.

24:19.251 --> 24:23.046
But I spend every free moment with him.
I call him, I page him...

24:23.088 --> 24:25.257
- You've been good.
- Nothing seems to be enough.

24:25.340 --> 24:27.676
Nothing seems to make things
normal again.

24:27.759 --> 24:28.802
Give it some time.

24:28.886 --> 24:30.762
I just want things to be
the way they were.

24:30.804 --> 24:32.472
Honey, relationships are hard.

24:32.556 --> 24:36.852
Sometimes you go through a weird patch
and things get funky for a little while.

24:36.935 --> 24:40.439
But just give it a chance. Ride it out.
Things will calm down again.

24:40.522 --> 24:41.773
I hope so.

24:42.149 --> 24:43.859
I'm gonna erase the messages.

24:46.486 --> 24:48.572
Stop that. Stop making me laugh.

24:49.448 --> 24:51.200
You are trying to kill me.

24:51.283 --> 24:54.870
You're making me laugh myself to death
so you can get away with a crime.

24:54.953 --> 24:57.623
- Your mind is evil.
- Your soul is empty.

24:57.664 --> 25:00.083
- Do you want some coffee?
- Yes, darling, thank you.

25:00.125 --> 25:01.585
I'll be right back.

25:02.169 --> 25:05.214
- Hello, Blue Eyes.
- Hi, Giselle. How was lunch?

25:06.006 --> 25:08.091
- Champagne, caviar. The usual.
- Sure.

25:08.175 --> 25:12.346
Then came mounds of pasta
with terrible things in it. It was perfect.

25:12.429 --> 25:14.723
You seem to be having a wonderful time.

25:14.806 --> 25:17.309
I am. I will miss him so much
when I go home.

25:17.392 --> 25:20.938
But thank goodness, he will have
an extra five pounds to remember me by...

25:20.979 --> 25:24.107
after eating all my pasta today,
that dirty, thieving boy.

25:24.149 --> 25:27.069
- Michel ate pasta?
- Yes, Michel loves pasta.

25:27.152 --> 25:29.279
- He eats it all the time.
- Not around us.

25:29.321 --> 25:31.406
Here it's all no-carb, low-cal.

25:31.490 --> 25:33.909
'Let me see if I can eat
less than the lab rats do. '

25:33.992 --> 25:35.869
- Lab rats?
- Better not explained.

25:35.953 --> 25:39.248
Anyway, I'm glad you got him
eating pasta. He seems really happy.

25:39.331 --> 25:40.624
Coffee.

25:43.836 --> 25:46.296
- This is horrible.
- You will drink it and like it.

25:46.338 --> 25:48.549
- You are a curse.
- Let's go shop.

25:48.632 --> 25:50.843
Yes, let's go buy something
completely useless...

25:50.926 --> 25:53.595
- and pay way too much money for it.
- I love it.

25:56.098 --> 25:57.641
That is so wrong.

25:58.684 --> 26:00.561
We should have waited for Paris.

26:00.644 --> 26:03.564
She's the one who threw a fit
about leaving no later than 3:10.

26:03.647 --> 26:06.233
She could be standing outside the school,
waiting for us.

26:06.316 --> 26:08.902
- She has my cell number.
- I thought you lost your phone.

26:08.986 --> 26:10.070
I did.

26:10.696 --> 26:12.489
We'll call her when we get inside.

26:12.531 --> 26:14.575
Tell her I wanted to wait, okay?

26:16.994 --> 26:19.079
You're right on time. Come on in.

26:19.663 --> 26:20.789
Okay.

26:20.873 --> 26:23.083
In the dining room, everyone.

26:26.295 --> 26:27.337
Welcome, everyone...

26:27.379 --> 26:31.216
to the first official board meeting
of the Style Aid Corporation.

26:31.383 --> 26:33.802
Will everyone please take a seat?

26:34.720 --> 26:36.471
I feel like Ivan Boesky.

26:36.555 --> 26:40.100
Rory, you are group leader, which
translates into chairman of the board...

26:40.184 --> 26:42.186
which means
you sit at the head of the table.

26:42.227 --> 26:45.355
- But that's where you sit.
- Not today. Come on.

26:46.899 --> 26:49.860
At this point, I would like
to turn the meeting over to Paris...

26:49.943 --> 26:52.988
who will bring us up to date
on our latest development. Paris.

26:53.071 --> 26:54.364
Thank you, Richard.

26:54.406 --> 26:57.367
First, let me say that I'm glad
to see you all here today...

26:57.409 --> 27:00.996
at the beginning of what I think
is going to be a very exciting experiment.

27:01.079 --> 27:03.415
Does she have the baseball bat
in her hands?

27:03.457 --> 27:07.461
I'd like everyone to turn to Page 1
in your presentation booklets.

27:07.544 --> 27:09.755
We haven't gotten to the pencil part yet.

27:09.838 --> 27:11.381
Sorry.

27:11.882 --> 27:14.593
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...

27:15.511 --> 27:17.846
the Rx 2002.

27:17.930 --> 27:19.890
- Nice.
- Very nice.

27:19.973 --> 27:23.936
Listed in front of you are all the contents
contained in the Rx 2002...

27:24.019 --> 27:26.480
plus the additional style options, 12 in all.

27:26.563 --> 27:30.484
Every one of them waterproof, fireproof,
and comes with a five-year warranty.

27:30.567 --> 27:33.570
Which is longer than
most of your high-school careers.

27:33.654 --> 27:35.322
He is funny.

27:35.405 --> 27:38.826
There's also a deluxe model
with extra features...

27:38.909 --> 27:42.704
designed to personalize your kit
even more specifically for your needs.

27:42.788 --> 27:46.291
There will be a snap-in CD case
which can hold up to 10 CDs.

27:46.375 --> 27:47.876
There's a lighted vanity mirror...

27:47.960 --> 27:50.921
and a divided compartment
for makeup and knickknacks...

27:50.963 --> 27:54.049
a picture frame,
and a hidden mini-vault for valuables...

27:54.132 --> 27:55.843
which can be locked for safety.

27:55.926 --> 27:59.137
- Terrific idea, Richard, really. Top-notch.
- Thank you, Paris.

27:59.179 --> 28:01.473
This is really amazing. I want one of these.

28:01.557 --> 28:05.185
Exactly the point. Let's check in
with our marketing department.

28:05.269 --> 28:07.271
Madeline, Louise,
what have you got for us?

28:07.312 --> 28:10.566
Okay, first, we go for the obvious.
Magazines.

28:10.649 --> 28:13.068
You know, Teen, Young Miss, Seventeen.

28:13.151 --> 28:15.988
Spin and Rolling Stone,
especially to hit the guys.

28:16.029 --> 28:18.991
I hear that Jane magazine
also has a young, hip following.

28:19.032 --> 28:20.951
How do you know about Jane magazine?

28:20.993 --> 28:22.494
I have my ways, young lady.

28:22.578 --> 28:24.830
We should also place them
in certain mall stores.

28:24.913 --> 28:26.832
I think we should go
straight to the source.

28:26.915 --> 28:28.083
- The schools?
- Why not?

28:28.167 --> 28:29.918
School bulletin-boards. Websites.

28:30.002 --> 28:32.921
You can set up tables at football games
and pep rallies.

28:33.005 --> 28:35.799
- How is everyone doing here?
- Just fine, Emily.

28:35.841 --> 28:37.926
Good. Is there enough food?

28:38.010 --> 28:39.511
Yes, there is plenty of food.

28:39.595 --> 28:41.513
What about ice cream?
Would anyone like...

28:41.555 --> 28:44.766
Emily, we're in the middle
of a business meeting.

28:45.684 --> 28:49.146
I'm very sorry.
Go back to your business meeting.

28:49.354 --> 28:51.565
I think your projections...

28:51.648 --> 28:53.275
- He's smiling.
- I know!

28:53.358 --> 28:55.485
He's smiling,
and there's no oil on the carpet.

28:55.527 --> 28:56.862
- Life is good.
- Yes, it is.

28:56.945 --> 28:58.864
Emily, please.

28:59.114 --> 29:00.782
I'm going.

29:00.866 --> 29:03.076
Richard, do you have
the third-year projections?

29:03.160 --> 29:05.954
Yes, Paris, I do. I have them right here.

29:18.008 --> 29:20.344
Dean. How's it going?

29:20.886 --> 29:23.722
- Just washing Rory's car.
- I can see that.

29:24.264 --> 29:26.225
I came by to see her and she wasn't here...

29:26.308 --> 29:28.060
so I was just gonna wait on the porch...

29:28.143 --> 29:31.104
but then I noticed her car looked dirty,
I thought I'd wash it.

29:31.188 --> 29:34.441
Sometimes things can get on your car.
Like dirt, certain kinds of sap.

29:34.525 --> 29:37.027
They get into your paint.
It's really hard to get off.

29:37.069 --> 29:39.905
Even water spots.
After it rains, they can be a real problem.

29:39.988 --> 29:42.115
- Okay. Would you like a soda?
- No, I'm fine.

29:42.199 --> 29:45.410
Put the squirting-water thing down
and come in the kitchen.

29:45.494 --> 29:48.664
Squirting thing down. That's it. Come on.

29:51.875 --> 29:55.504
I really didn't mean to bother you.
I can wait outside until Rory gets home.

29:55.587 --> 29:58.423
Honey, Rory's working
on her school project today.

29:59.341 --> 30:03.762
Yeah. I guess I forgot.
I mean, she must have told me that she...

30:04.388 --> 30:06.849
- I'm sorry. I forgot.
- That's okay.

30:07.015 --> 30:10.727
- I'll just go.
- No, come here. Sit down for a sec.

30:16.275 --> 30:17.568
Are you all right?

30:17.609 --> 30:21.280
Yeah, fine, I just don't remember Rory
telling me about her studying today.

30:21.363 --> 30:23.115
I swear I wouldn't have come over.

30:23.198 --> 30:25.242
Can I maybe give you a little advice?

30:25.284 --> 30:27.035
- Sure.
- Okay.

30:27.786 --> 30:31.248
First, I just want to tell you
I think you are a great guy.

30:31.331 --> 30:33.041
You're so good to Rory.

30:33.125 --> 30:35.752
Even though I hoped
she'd be the one girl in the world...

30:35.794 --> 30:39.548
who wouldn't look at a boy until
she was 38, I'm really glad she found you.

30:39.631 --> 30:40.674
Thanks.

30:40.757 --> 30:43.760
I know things have been
a little off between you two lately.

30:43.844 --> 30:45.929
- Did she say that?
- No. I'm saying that.

30:45.971 --> 30:49.057
I can see it. And, by the way, I get it.

30:49.474 --> 30:53.812
Sometimes when things are out of whack,
it freaks us out a little...

30:53.979 --> 30:57.608
and makes us feel like we're
losing something that's really important...

30:57.649 --> 30:58.984
and that scares us even more...

30:59.067 --> 31:01.945
so we try to hold on
to whatever it is we think we're losing.

31:01.987 --> 31:05.991
And sometimes we hold on
a little too hard.

31:06.074 --> 31:07.201
Too hard?

31:07.284 --> 31:11.079
Like 'calling 10 times
in a three-hour period' too hard.

31:11.163 --> 31:12.331
Fourteen times.

31:12.414 --> 31:15.876
Okay, see, I was gonna let you slide,
but an honest man, I like that.

31:15.959 --> 31:17.836
You think I'm holding on too hard to Rory?

31:17.920 --> 31:19.213
I don't think you mean to.

31:19.296 --> 31:22.674
- You think I'm losing her?
- I think you think you are.

31:22.758 --> 31:25.177
I just feel like nothing I do is...

31:25.552 --> 31:28.013
I just want things back
the way they used to be.

31:28.096 --> 31:31.391
- I know you do. And they can be.
- How?

31:31.475 --> 31:34.186
I know it sounds crazy, but sometimes...

31:34.269 --> 31:38.649
giving people a little bit of space
is actually the best thing to do.

31:38.690 --> 31:40.526
- Space?
- Just a little.

31:40.567 --> 31:42.736
Like what? Don't call her? Don't see her?

31:42.819 --> 31:46.698
No. Just let her breathe. Let her relax.

31:47.074 --> 31:49.076
Let her come to you for a change.

31:49.159 --> 31:51.703
You're not telling me this
to get rid of me, are you?

31:51.787 --> 31:53.872
Please! If I was trying to get rid of you...

31:53.956 --> 31:56.708
I would've started with,
'Let me tell you about my family. '

31:56.792 --> 31:59.294
I'm not telling you this to get rid of you.

31:59.378 --> 32:03.340
I'm telling you because I think
it might help things between you guys.

32:03.423 --> 32:04.842
Just try it.

32:04.883 --> 32:08.470
If it doesn't work, I promise,
you can wash my car, too.

32:08.554 --> 32:09.680
Okay.

32:10.556 --> 32:13.559
- Do you want a soda?
- No, thanks. I'm gonna go.

32:17.729 --> 32:19.940
Don't tell Rory I was here, okay?

32:20.023 --> 32:23.819
I'm just sitting here at the table,
talking to myself. Again.

32:23.902 --> 32:25.988
- Thanks.
- Bye, Dean.

32:32.452 --> 32:35.455
You know what? Forget it!
If that's how you run your business...

32:35.539 --> 32:37.749
I deserve this
for picking you in the first place!

32:37.833 --> 32:39.126
I hate you!

32:40.419 --> 32:42.713
Okay, new plan for the invites.

32:42.754 --> 32:46.341
We're getting married May 15,
4:00, front lawn. Pass it on.

32:46.425 --> 32:49.845
That's it. Word of mouth.
They used it for the Revolutionary War.

32:49.928 --> 32:52.556
Who the hell am I to poo-poo history,
I ask you?

32:52.598 --> 32:54.433
What the hell is wrong with you?

32:54.516 --> 32:56.768
- With me?
- Yes, you. Are you out of your mind?

32:56.810 --> 32:57.936
What are you talking about?

32:58.020 --> 33:01.273
Why in God's name would you
tell my mother that I do not eat carbs?

33:01.356 --> 33:04.610
- Because you don't.
- That is private information about me.

33:04.651 --> 33:07.362
Everybody in Stars Hollow knows
you don't eat carbs.

33:07.446 --> 33:09.573
- So what?
- Calm down. Have some toast.

33:09.615 --> 33:12.534
Do not talk to my mother ever again.
Do you understand me?

33:12.618 --> 33:15.954
I don't understand. You and your mother
seem crazy about each other.

33:16.038 --> 33:18.749
I assumed, since you gave up carbs
a year ago, she knew.

33:18.790 --> 33:20.417
You know what happens
when you assume.

33:20.501 --> 33:21.502
What?

33:21.585 --> 33:24.463
Something about a donkey.
It's a stupid American phrase!

33:24.546 --> 33:27.591
You and your mother
seem to have the perfect relationship.

33:27.633 --> 33:31.261
Yes. Because I tell her nothing.
We keep all subjects light and fluffy.

33:31.345 --> 33:35.432
We talk about clothes, food, Posh Spice
and David Beckham, and that is all.

33:35.474 --> 33:37.476
Nothing of value. Nothing of substance.

33:37.518 --> 33:38.560
I'm sorry.

33:38.644 --> 33:40.854
Now she knows
I've been hiding something from her.

33:40.938 --> 33:42.314
Suddenly she's asking questions.

33:42.356 --> 33:44.733
Why did I leave France at 18?
Where do I go at night?

33:44.816 --> 33:47.402
Who are my friends? What do they do?
Where do they live?

33:47.486 --> 33:50.280
Why have I chosen this career?
On and on. It never ends.

33:50.322 --> 33:53.242
I can't stand it.
She's a complete pain. She won't stop.

33:53.325 --> 33:57.287
I took a six-hour bath last night
just to escape the incessant nagging.

33:57.329 --> 33:59.414
You did this to me!

33:59.498 --> 34:02.835
You turned my Giselle into a mother,
and I hate you for it!

34:02.918 --> 34:05.045
I hate you very much!

34:07.673 --> 34:10.092
So, feel better now?

34:10.175 --> 34:11.844
Yeah, I do. Thanks.

34:14.513 --> 34:17.014
I've swept the room,
and I have to tell you, all sad.

34:17.099 --> 34:18.141
I think we're a lock.

34:18.183 --> 34:20.518
I actually thought
the locker alarm was pretty good.

34:20.601 --> 34:22.521
No one even looks
when a car alarm goes off.

34:22.603 --> 34:24.773
How effective
is a locker alarm going to be?

34:24.857 --> 34:27.317
Nope. I feel it. We are it.

34:27.693 --> 34:28.777
What's the word?

34:28.860 --> 34:31.905
Every single idea in this room
is completely worthless.

34:31.989 --> 34:33.824
There's a lot of wasted cardboard in here.

34:33.866 --> 34:35.742
- We are going to win.
- Yes, we are.

34:35.826 --> 34:38.745
Okay, the two of you
need to take a timeout.

34:38.829 --> 34:41.623
- Richard, hello.
- Hanlin, good to see you.

34:41.706 --> 34:43.125
What are you doing here?

34:43.208 --> 34:47.045
I'm actually advising Rory
on her business project. The Rx 2002.

34:47.087 --> 34:50.047
- That's wonderful. You look great.
- I feel great.

34:50.090 --> 34:53.385
- We don't see you at the club that much.
- I've been very busy lately.

34:53.467 --> 34:56.429
- Did I hear correctly? Did you retire?
- Right before Christmas.

34:56.513 --> 34:59.516
So it's true. Biddy and I couldn't
believe it when we heard that.

34:59.600 --> 35:01.059
A man can't work forever.

35:01.143 --> 35:04.104
No, that's true.
I just can't picture you retired.

35:04.188 --> 35:06.773
It's been wonderful lately.
Best move I've ever made.

35:06.857 --> 35:08.734
It's given me time to do wonderful things.

35:08.775 --> 35:11.361
That does sound nice.
What kinds of things are you doing?

35:11.445 --> 35:12.863
Well, this.

35:12.905 --> 35:14.865
There you go!

35:14.907 --> 35:18.535
Unfortunately, some of us
aren't living the good life quite yet.

35:18.577 --> 35:20.996
I've got to get back.
It's been wonderful seeing you.

35:21.079 --> 35:23.540
- Let's have dinner soon.
- I would like that very much.

35:23.582 --> 35:26.668
- I'll have Biddy give Em a call.
- You do that.

35:27.336 --> 35:30.464
Did you see the hose-hook idea
over at Table 5?

35:30.547 --> 35:32.549
A hook on your belt for your garden hose.

35:32.591 --> 35:34.843
There's a Buster Keaton routine
waiting to happen.

35:34.927 --> 35:36.261
How are we doing?

35:36.303 --> 35:39.348
Paris is practicing spiking the football
and doing a back flip.

35:39.431 --> 35:42.893
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.
All the projects have now been reviewed.

35:42.976 --> 35:44.061
Here we go.

35:44.102 --> 35:47.898
Before we announce the winner, I must
commend everyone for their fine work.

35:47.940 --> 35:51.568
There are many good ideas here today.
It makes me proud.

35:51.610 --> 35:53.070
Move it along, padre.

35:53.111 --> 35:55.489
Now I'd like to announce the winner.

35:55.572 --> 35:58.951
Table 10. Miss Chester's class
with the locker alarm.

35:59.034 --> 36:01.078
I don't understand. How's that possible?

36:01.161 --> 36:04.540
This is so lame. That alarm
doesn't even work. I was just over there.

36:04.623 --> 36:05.916
This is ludicrous.

36:05.958 --> 36:08.460
- Grandpa, it doesn't matter.
- It certainly does matter.

36:08.544 --> 36:12.422
You've put in an extraordinary amount
of time and effort and thought into this.

36:12.464 --> 36:14.091
- It deserved to win.
- Yeah.

36:14.132 --> 36:15.968
I wanted to win, too, but we didn't.

36:16.051 --> 36:18.804
- I'm going to talk to the headmaster.
- I wish you wouldn't.

36:18.846 --> 36:23.517
You were robbed, Rory, and I'm not gonna
sit back and simply watch it happen.

36:24.309 --> 36:26.937
Hanlin, good. I want a word with you.

36:27.020 --> 36:30.065
- Is something wrong?
- This contest is a disgrace!

36:30.148 --> 36:31.275
I beg your pardon?

36:31.358 --> 36:33.861
I've been in the business world
for 35 years.

36:33.944 --> 36:37.614
And in those 35 years,
I've seen ideas come and go.

36:37.656 --> 36:40.993
And I've learned a few things
about what flies and what doesn't.

36:41.034 --> 36:42.870
- I'm sure you have.
- I am telling you...

36:42.953 --> 36:44.705
that out there, in the real world...

36:44.788 --> 36:48.041
there is no way that a locker alarm
that doesn't even work properly...

36:48.125 --> 36:49.877
would be a viable business investment.

36:49.960 --> 36:52.504
We're not in the real world.
We are in a school.

36:52.588 --> 36:55.424
A school that should be
training children for the real world.

36:55.507 --> 36:57.634
- Calm down.
- I demand a recount!

36:57.718 --> 37:01.513
Very well. I just recounted.
The alarm still wins.

37:01.555 --> 37:04.975
Your project was very good.
It was definitely in the running.

37:05.017 --> 37:06.226
You should be proud.

37:06.310 --> 37:09.688
This is not my project!
This is their project. The children's project.

37:09.771 --> 37:10.898
- Really?
- Yes!

37:10.981 --> 37:13.567
This has nothing to do with me!
It's for the children!

37:13.650 --> 37:17.905
But they're not the ones causing
the public scene right now. You are.

37:26.955 --> 37:28.916
It was awful. He looked so upset.

37:28.999 --> 37:31.543
His face was turning red
and he was practically shaking.

37:31.627 --> 37:33.712
Did you notice
when he gets mad he gets taller?

37:33.795 --> 37:35.506
I don't know how but he actually grows!

37:35.547 --> 37:38.675
The day I told him I was pregnant,
24 feet tall. Freaked the birds.

37:38.759 --> 37:41.094
- I'm upset here.
- Honey, you did nothing.

37:41.178 --> 37:43.639
You went to your grandfather
who you greatly admire...

37:43.722 --> 37:46.850
and actually like hanging out with,
to ask for his help and advice.

37:46.934 --> 37:48.185
That's lovely and thoughtful.

37:48.227 --> 37:49.520
Please help me out tonight.

37:49.561 --> 37:52.689
No mention of work, or Chilton,
or school, or retirement.

37:52.731 --> 37:55.359
Nothing but politics and religion. Got it.

37:55.442 --> 37:56.860
- Hello, girls.
- Hi, Mom.

37:56.902 --> 37:58.779
- Hi, Grandma.
- Come in.

38:01.448 --> 38:04.743
Dinner's almost ready.
Richard, the girls are here.

38:07.079 --> 38:09.164
He came home today, didn't say a word...

38:09.248 --> 38:11.208
stomped off to his study,
slammed the door.

38:11.291 --> 38:13.001
He's been holed up in there ever since.

38:13.085 --> 38:14.503
I can't even get him to answer me.

38:14.586 --> 38:16.588
- Are you sure he's still in there?
- Of course.

38:16.672 --> 38:19.216
The door's right there.
I would have seen if he came out.

38:19.299 --> 38:20.759
Not everyone leaves this house...

38:20.843 --> 38:23.720
by climbing out the window
and jumping into a waiting hot rod.

38:23.762 --> 38:26.265
- Someone should talk to him.
- I don't know what to do.

38:26.306 --> 38:29.393
- What happened today?
- Things didn't go well at the business fair.

38:29.476 --> 38:30.811
- What happened?
- It was terrible.

38:30.894 --> 38:33.772
The 10th graders staged
a hostile takeover of the 11th graders.

38:33.814 --> 38:35.816
Our project didn't win.
Grandpa took it badly.

38:35.899 --> 38:39.862
I am at my wit's end. If that man is
going to fall apart over a school project...

38:39.945 --> 38:42.698
- It's a weird time for him.
- I feel awful.

38:42.781 --> 38:45.242
- Maybe he should go talk to somebody.
- Like whom?

38:45.325 --> 38:47.119
Like a psychiatrist.

38:47.161 --> 38:48.912
- What?
- Maybe it would help.

38:48.954 --> 38:50.956
We do not go to psychiatrists.

38:50.998 --> 38:53.250
Mom, there's nothing wrong
with getting help.

38:53.292 --> 38:56.128
Lorelai Gilmore,
are you seriously suggesting...

38:56.211 --> 38:59.798
that your father go to a complete stranger
and talk about his personal life?

38:59.882 --> 39:01.216
Lots of people swear by it.

39:01.300 --> 39:03.927
Yes. Disturbed people. Deviants.

39:04.011 --> 39:08.140
People with multiple personalities
who see things and hear dogs talking...

39:08.223 --> 39:12.019
and roam the streets talking
to themselves and licking parking meters.

39:12.102 --> 39:15.981
Next thing you know,
you'll be suggesting I go to a psychiatrist.

39:16.023 --> 39:18.150
Too many comebacks. I cannot pick.

39:18.317 --> 39:21.153
- Richard? Is that you?
- Of course it's me.

39:21.487 --> 39:24.490
Rory, you're here. Wonderful!
Hello, Lorelai.

39:24.615 --> 39:26.992
I am starving. What's for dinner?

39:27.451 --> 39:30.412
What's for dinner?
What do you mean, what's for dinner?

39:30.496 --> 39:34.625
I thought the question was relatively clear,
but I'd be glad to rephrase it for you.

39:34.708 --> 39:38.712
What sort of food products
will appear on various plates this evening?

39:38.795 --> 39:42.674
You come home in a huff, then you
lock yourself in that study all afternoon...

39:42.758 --> 39:45.969
I had a lot of thinking to do.
A lot of thinking.

39:46.512 --> 39:48.680
- I owe that to you, young lady.
- I'm sorry.

39:48.764 --> 39:51.600
- You should certainly not be sorry.
- Richard, what...

39:51.683 --> 39:54.394
Put that roll down and explain yourself.

39:55.354 --> 39:58.482
This whole week,
this whole experience with Rory...

39:58.565 --> 40:02.194
and the locker first-aid kit...
That is a damn good idea, by the way...

40:02.277 --> 40:05.239
no matter what those yarn-heads
at that school of yours say.

40:05.322 --> 40:08.534
Anyway, this whole week
made me realize something:

40:09.201 --> 40:11.036
I don't want to be retired.

40:11.119 --> 40:13.205
- You what?
- I don't like it.

40:13.539 --> 40:16.041
- I hate it, as a matter of fact.
- But, Dad...

40:16.124 --> 40:19.670
It's boring. I have absolutely no idea
what to do with myself.

40:19.711 --> 40:23.507
Frankly, I am tired of trying
to find something to fill up my time.

40:23.549 --> 40:25.884
- So what are you going to do?
- I'm going to work.

40:25.926 --> 40:28.720
- Are you asking for your job back?
- God, no.

40:28.804 --> 40:33.058
No, I have decided
to go into business for myself.

40:33.100 --> 40:34.351
- Wow.
- What?

40:34.393 --> 40:36.228
- Cool.
- It is cool, isn't it?

40:36.270 --> 40:39.064
- What are you going to do?
- I'm not sure yet.

40:39.106 --> 40:41.900
Perhaps I'll consult,
maybe take on a partner.

40:41.984 --> 40:43.777
- Maybe I'll even teach.
- What?

40:43.861 --> 40:47.072
- You don't have to say it like that.
- Sorry. What?

40:47.573 --> 40:50.993
I think 35 years of experience
will qualify me...

40:51.076 --> 40:54.204
to teach a course or two
at that local business college of yours.

40:54.246 --> 40:56.957
My God.
It's Who's The Boss? The Later Years.

40:57.040 --> 41:00.419
- Richard, are you serious about this?
- As a heart attack.

41:00.460 --> 41:03.422
I haven't felt this good
in a very long time, Emily.

41:03.505 --> 41:05.132
I have the buzz.

41:05.757 --> 41:09.094
- And I owe it all to you.
- Glad to be of service.

41:09.178 --> 41:10.387
He's going to teach.

41:10.429 --> 41:12.181
Or consult.

41:12.264 --> 41:15.726
So, licking a parking meter
is just around the corner.

41:18.187 --> 41:21.231
- Okay, that dinner was good.
- All of Grandma's dinners are good.

41:21.315 --> 41:24.401
- I know, but this one had the rolls.
- Those were excellent rolls.

41:24.485 --> 41:27.571
Weren't they?
Hot and buttery with that split-top thing.

41:27.613 --> 41:30.324
- I miss the rolls.
- She can make more next week.

41:30.407 --> 41:32.993
- That's okay. I got four in my purse.
- You do not.

41:33.076 --> 41:34.786
Go ahead and check.

41:35.579 --> 41:37.247
Have you no shame?

41:37.623 --> 41:39.041
Who's that?

41:40.834 --> 41:41.877
It's Dean.

41:41.960 --> 41:44.254
Really? How many pages
does that make for today?

41:44.296 --> 41:45.464
Just one.

41:45.547 --> 41:47.174
- You're kidding.
- In two days.

41:47.257 --> 41:49.009
- Wow.
- I know.

41:49.092 --> 41:52.346
He hasn't called or mysteriously
appeared by my side or anything.

41:52.429 --> 41:54.598
- Maybe he's calming down.
- I hope so.

41:54.640 --> 41:56.683
I actually got a chance to miss him today.

41:56.767 --> 41:58.977
- That sounds good.
- It is good.

41:59.061 --> 42:01.021
You want to grab my cell phone
and call him?

42:01.104 --> 42:02.356
No. Tomorrow's fine.

42:02.439 --> 42:05.734
Are you sure? It's early.
You guys could hook up for a little while.

42:05.818 --> 42:07.778
- I'm hanging out with Lane tonight.
- Lane?

42:07.861 --> 42:10.823
Yeah. We have some serious
CD listening to do.

42:10.864 --> 42:13.450
We're way behind
on all the Elvis Costello reissues.

42:13.492 --> 42:15.452
I didn't think
Lane could hang out past 9:00.

42:15.494 --> 42:17.996
Her mom's at an antique fair in Woodbury
until Sunday.

42:18.080 --> 42:20.916
Her grandmother's staying with her,
but she's asleep by 6:00.

42:20.999 --> 42:23.627
So we thought we'd be really bad
and sneak out to Luke's.

42:23.669 --> 42:25.963
- You're going to Luke's?
- Maybe.

42:26.004 --> 42:29.341
Why go to Luke's?
I mean, you just had 10 rolls.

42:29.424 --> 42:32.886
No, you did, and I don't even know
if we'll go. It's just a maybe.

42:32.970 --> 42:34.972
Okay, you guys have fun.

42:45.190 --> 42:46.900
Okay. See you later.

42:46.984 --> 42:50.571
- Sure you don't want to call Dean?
- Nope. Tomorrow's fine.

42:50.654 --> 42:52.531
Yeah. Tomorrow's fine.

43:25.397 --> 43:27.357
She likes Jess, doesn't she?
