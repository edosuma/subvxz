00:12.721 --> 00:14.806
[narrator] <i>Previously</i>
<i>on </i>Star Trek: Discovery:

00:14.889 --> 00:17.726
[Book] <i>Michael, I was on my way</i>
<i>to the Bajoran exchange</i>

00:17.809 --> 00:20.437
<i>when this guy sitting next to me...</i>
<i>I think his black box</i>

00:20.520 --> 00:22.022
<i>is one of the ones you're looking for.</i>

00:22.564 --> 00:25.775
<i>It's on Hunhau, Emerald Chain territory.</i>
<i>I won't be long.</i>

00:25.859 --> 00:27.444
This was three weeks ago.

00:27.527 --> 00:30.739
If Book found a third black box
and it shows the same variants,

00:30.822 --> 00:34.492
the Burn didn't happen all at once.
We have got to get to Hunhau.

00:34.576 --> 00:37.537
-At the moment, we cannot.
-Yes, sir.

00:37.620 --> 00:40.749
You're the only one who'd say yes
to going on an unsanctioned mission.

00:40.832 --> 00:45.003
-Are you in or out? Georgiou?
-You had me at "unsanctioned mission."

00:45.086 --> 00:47.297
The spore drive's new and improved.

00:47.380 --> 00:49.507
I redesigned it so you won't have
to use those shunts.

00:49.591 --> 00:51.342
A little gooey.

00:51.426 --> 00:56.055
Commander Burnham left
to pursue a mission of her own,

00:56.139 --> 00:57.724
against my direct orders.

00:57.807 --> 01:02.687
Sir, you know Michael is one of the people
that I love most in this world,

01:02.771 --> 01:04.856
but she made a choice,
and now because of that,

01:04.939 --> 01:06.066
you don't have one.

01:06.149 --> 01:09.694
-You have to tell the admiral.
-That is astute, ensign.

01:10.945 --> 01:13.490
Commander Burnham's mission
was 100 percent rogue.

01:13.573 --> 01:17.160
Until we solve the mystery
of how the Burn happened and why,

01:17.243 --> 01:19.829
I believe the Federation will never be,

01:19.913 --> 01:22.832
can never be brought back together again.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.502
We'll see what your intel brings,
commander.

01:26.127 --> 01:27.754
I will leave it up to you, captain,

01:28.755 --> 01:31.925
to determine the consequences
of her insubordination.

01:32.008 --> 01:35.637
As of now, you're relieved of your duty
as my Number One.

01:36.429 --> 01:41.059
You will restrict yourself
to chief science officer duties only.

01:44.103 --> 01:46.105
[dramatic music playing]

01:47.982 --> 01:50.026
[Burnham] <i>Personal log, supplemental.</i>

01:51.820 --> 01:54.405
<i>Even after a year of finding my way alone,</i>

01:55.448 --> 01:58.827
<i>I truly believed I could find a way</i>
<i>to fit back into this uniform,</i>

01:59.994 --> 02:01.079
<i>on to this ship.</i>

02:02.997 --> 02:04.457
<i>Now I'm not so sure.</i>

02:06.334 --> 02:08.086
<i>I've become someone new.</i>

02:10.380 --> 02:13.800
<i>Still just as committed</i>
<i>to the Federation, to my friends,</i>

02:15.051 --> 02:17.595
<i>but there's a distance between us now.</i>

02:19.389 --> 02:22.058
<i>I'll never be at peace</i>
<i>until I solve the Burn,</i>

02:23.101 --> 02:25.436
<i>but I don't know</i>
<i>if I can do it from </i>Discovery.

02:28.356 --> 02:30.817
<i>This may not be my home anymore.</i>

02:32.527 --> 02:34.112
<i>I don't know what that means...</i>

02:35.947 --> 02:37.448
<i>or where it will lead me.</i>

02:47.375 --> 02:49.377
[tender music playing]

02:53.214 --> 02:54.716
When are we getting out of here?

02:56.926 --> 02:58.219
You really hate it.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.096
[Book] "Hate" is a strong word.

03:00.555 --> 03:03.683
But I'm also living on the Shuttlebay
of a Federation starship,

03:03.766 --> 03:05.894
and no one knows what to make of me.

03:05.977 --> 03:09.022
Let's acknowledge
this isn't a long-term situation.

03:10.648 --> 03:12.942
-Where would we go?
-Space.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.653
-Mmm. And what about--?
-The Burn?

03:15.737 --> 03:16.571
Yeah.

03:17.071 --> 03:19.407
The biggest, most dangerous
cosmic puzzle of all time?

03:20.366 --> 03:21.743
Have you always been this way?

03:26.247 --> 03:27.081
My brother...

03:29.083 --> 03:30.376
he called me on it.

03:32.962 --> 03:35.048
How I take responsibility for everything.

03:36.299 --> 03:38.468
Sounds like we'd have gotten on,
me and your brother.

03:38.551 --> 03:39.928
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.514
We'd bond over
your endearing messianic complex.

03:43.598 --> 03:47.352
Hmm. Says the man who risks his life
to save helpless creatures.

03:47.435 --> 03:49.103
-Oh, yeah.
-Mm.

04:05.995 --> 04:06.871
Hey.

04:07.497 --> 04:10.208
-Saru, uh...
-Demoted me. Yeah.

04:12.460 --> 04:13.711
Hey, um...

04:15.171 --> 04:20.134
you put me in a really horrible position
with Saru and with the admiral

04:20.218 --> 04:21.761
when you went off on your own.

04:22.303 --> 04:24.389
Would've been so much worse
if I had told you.

04:24.472 --> 04:25.598
My choice.

04:27.058 --> 04:28.059
Not yours.

04:30.436 --> 04:32.188
I'm sorry, Tilly.

04:33.022 --> 04:35.650
This transition has been difficult
for all of us.

04:35.733 --> 04:36.859
I had to go.

04:38.653 --> 04:39.737
I had to.

04:42.699 --> 04:43.783
The truth is...

04:46.244 --> 04:48.830
I don't know how I fit in anymore.

04:54.252 --> 04:59.007
One one-millionth of a microsecond.
You were right. That was the difference.

04:59.090 --> 05:01.342
The <i>U.S.S. Yelchin,</i>
the first black box you found,

05:01.426 --> 05:03.761
when the Burn happened, it lost contact

05:03.845 --> 05:08.099
at precisely 81986 mark 272139.

05:08.182 --> 05:11.019
And now the <i>Gav'Nor,</i>
a thousand light-years away,

05:11.102 --> 05:14.230
lost contact one one-millionth
of a microsecond later.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.567
-The <i>Giacconi? </i>The recorder Book found?
-Computer's still working on it.

05:17.650 --> 05:20.903
With this data, we can triangulate
and pinpoint the source of the Burn.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.781
In two dimensions, maybe,
but in three-dimensional space,

05:23.865 --> 05:27.493
that leaves an area far too large
to explore in several lifetimes.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.037
So, we have to narrow it down.

05:29.537 --> 05:32.999
-Somehow, we need to find more data.
-Well, I flagged this...

05:34.834 --> 05:37.879
when I was going through
Federation databases,

05:37.962 --> 05:40.006
it's an experiment, SB-19.

05:40.089 --> 05:43.009
They spread sensors across dozens
of light-years of subspace.

05:43.092 --> 05:46.554
-They had a front-seat view of the Burn.
-SB-19 reported no findings.

05:46.637 --> 05:48.639
Either the sensors
didn't record anything...

05:48.723 --> 05:51.100
-Unlikely.
-Or they didn't make their results public.

05:51.184 --> 05:55.229
-The admiral might have access to it.
-He's not my biggest fan right now.

05:55.938 --> 05:59.692
This is bigger than you, bigger than him.
It's bigger than everybody, heh, it's...

06:00.318 --> 06:02.320
[suspenseful music playing]

06:04.655 --> 06:06.282
What if you hadn't made it back?

06:09.035 --> 06:10.036
What would I do?

06:13.998 --> 06:15.708
[computer]<i> Analysis complete.</i>

06:16.793 --> 06:18.461
The <i>Giacconi</i> lost contact

06:19.253 --> 06:21.756
seven one-millionths of a microsecond
after the <i>Yelchin.</i>

06:23.049 --> 06:24.133
That confirms it.

06:26.385 --> 06:29.597
[Vance]<i> You're telling me these</i>
<i>three ships were destroyed by the Burn</i>

06:29.680 --> 06:30.556
<i>at different times?</i>

06:32.183 --> 06:34.435
[Burnham] The difference is in millionths
of a microsecond,

06:34.519 --> 06:37.438
but, yes, there is a difference.

06:39.273 --> 06:40.316
Son of a bitch.

06:40.399 --> 06:43.528
Are you familiar
with an experiment called SB-19?

06:43.611 --> 06:45.822
[woman speaking on PA indistinctly]

06:48.533 --> 06:50.409
-We can't access it.
-Why?

06:52.787 --> 06:53.746
It's Ni'Var.

06:55.498 --> 06:58.751
You'd know it by its former name, Vulcan.

07:01.629 --> 07:03.923
Vulcans? The Vulcans changed their name?

07:04.549 --> 07:08.219
It's not just the Vulcans who live there.
They share the planet with the Romulans.

07:08.302 --> 07:12.223
The Romulans were considered
enemies in our time.

07:12.306 --> 07:14.267
And for a long time after,

07:14.350 --> 07:16.853
until Ambassador Spock brought them back.

07:17.353 --> 07:19.355
History forgot this in your time,

07:19.439 --> 07:23.401
but the Vulcans and the Romulans
were two tribes of the same species

07:23.484 --> 07:25.069
that went their separate ways.

07:25.153 --> 07:28.948
Your brother started the process
of reunifying them.

07:29.031 --> 07:30.366
And he succeeded.

07:31.033 --> 07:33.744
It took centuries after his death,
but yes.

07:36.038 --> 07:39.834
But the Vulcans always shared
their research with the Federation.

07:39.917 --> 07:41.377
[Vance] Maybe in the past,

07:41.461 --> 07:45.006
but Ni'Var left the Federation
nearly a hundred years ago.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.805
[theme music playing]

09:22.186 --> 09:24.730
[Burnham] Vulcan was one of the founding
members of the Federation.

09:25.606 --> 09:29.860
They would never abandon it.
Must have been the Romulans.

09:29.944 --> 09:31.696
No, the Romulans wanted to stay.

09:32.780 --> 09:36.033
Even before the Burn, the Federation
was running out of dilithium.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.202
All member planets were ordered

09:38.286 --> 09:41.497
to put their best scientists
towards finding a solution.

09:42.373 --> 09:46.043
Ni'Var's contribution was SB-19.

09:47.128 --> 09:51.048
A system to transport starships
thousands of light-years in an instant,

09:51.132 --> 09:53.092
much like your spore drive.

09:53.175 --> 09:55.845
-What happened?
-Well, it was new technology.

09:56.470 --> 10:00.057
Ni'Var's scientists felt, ultimately,
that it was too dangerous.

10:00.141 --> 10:03.102
And so they asked permission
to shutter the program.

10:04.854 --> 10:07.732
But it was the most promising
dilithium alternative of the day,

10:07.815 --> 10:09.817
so the Federation ordered them to proceed.

10:09.900 --> 10:12.528
They think they caused the Burn?

10:12.612 --> 10:13.446
No.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.949
They think we forced them
to cause the Burn.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.035
[dramatic music playing]

10:19.118 --> 10:23.873
So, they left the Federation
and kept the SB-19 data from us.

10:23.956 --> 10:24.832
Sir...

10:25.875 --> 10:29.045
we have proof
the Burn had a different origin.

10:29.128 --> 10:32.048
I don't think any claims of proof
will make any difference.

10:32.131 --> 10:35.509
-They're convinced they're right.
-Well, perhaps, then,

10:35.593 --> 10:40.014
this new information would be sufficient
to reopen diplomatic relations.

10:40.097 --> 10:43.476
We have to tell them.
There must be a way to get them to listen.

10:47.647 --> 10:48.939
Spock's sister.

10:49.023 --> 10:52.610
Sending Commander Burnham as
our representative might tip the scales.

10:52.693 --> 10:55.112
Admiral, I must inform you,

10:55.196 --> 10:58.115
Commander Burnham was reprimanded
for her insubordinate actions

10:58.199 --> 11:00.409
and dismissed as my First Officer.

11:00.493 --> 11:01.952
Insubordinate or not,

11:02.036 --> 11:04.747
she's the only person
who could open that door,

11:04.830 --> 11:06.248
and with this new information--

11:06.332 --> 11:11.754
Sir, I don't think I can genuinely
represent the Federation right now.

11:13.172 --> 11:14.173
[Vance] Find a way.

11:14.715 --> 11:17.385
I'll bring the diplomatic corps
into the loop.

11:17.468 --> 11:20.262
And I'll send a full report to Ni'Var,
headline:

11:20.346 --> 11:22.014
"Michael Burnham is coming."

11:28.562 --> 11:30.064
[Burnham] <i>Listen to me, little brother.</i>

11:31.399 --> 11:33.818
<i>This is the last advice</i>
<i>I'll ever be able to give you.</i>

11:34.485 --> 11:36.612
<i>There is a whole galaxy out there</i>

11:37.363 --> 11:40.533
<i>full of people who will reach for you.</i>

11:43.536 --> 11:44.912
<i>You have to let them.</i>

11:47.873 --> 11:49.041
<i>Reach for them.</i>

[tender music playing]

13:04.492 --> 13:09.121
You know, I never let myself look back
to find out who he became.

13:10.122 --> 13:12.583
You guys are chronic overachievers.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.591
How am I gonna do this, Book?

13:22.635 --> 13:27.515
It's possible that a person who has
a complex relationship with the future

13:28.307 --> 13:30.893
is the exact right person to do this job.

13:37.983 --> 13:39.818
I am sure you have heard.

13:40.694 --> 13:43.155
I dismissed Commander Burnham
as my First Officer.

13:44.365 --> 13:46.325
Must've been very difficult, sir.

13:51.455 --> 13:54.875
I would like you to serve
as my acting First Officer

13:54.959 --> 13:57.169
until I find a permanent replacement.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.255
What? Sir, what?

14:00.256 --> 14:01.257
[Tilly chuckles]

14:01.966 --> 14:04.510
I never completed
the Command Training Program.

14:04.593 --> 14:09.640
You traveled through a wormhole
930 years into the future.

14:10.474 --> 14:14.979
I am confident in saying your experience
now exceeds the parameters

14:15.062 --> 14:17.856
designed for the Command Training Program.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.733
Sir, I'm an ensign. I--

14:21.652 --> 14:23.445
I'd be responsible for lives.

14:23.529 --> 14:27.449
Part of leadership is the acknowledgment
that one is suited to it.

14:27.533 --> 14:31.996
Many members of our crew have struggled
with all that has changed.

14:32.079 --> 14:35.207
I have watched you rise to the occasion.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.294
I believe you can help them rise as well.

14:38.377 --> 14:43.591
And I believe you will always put
the needs of Starfleet and the Federation

14:43.674 --> 14:45.551
ahead of your own wishes.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.471
Sir, are you asking me
because I'm qualified

14:49.555 --> 14:52.182
or because I'm compliant?

14:53.225 --> 14:57.730
I'm asking because I believe
this is in the best interest of our ship.

15:02.776 --> 15:04.653
Take a day to think about it.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.324
Now let us jump to Ni'Var.

15:14.246 --> 15:15.456
Status report, please.

15:15.998 --> 15:18.542

All hands ready to jump to Ni'Var.

15:18.626 --> 15:21.837
-HQ confirms that Ni'Var is expecting us.
-[Saru] Very well.

15:21.921 --> 15:25.758
The people of Ni'Var have not been visited

15:25.841 --> 15:28.761
by a Federation starship
in nearly a century.

15:28.844 --> 15:30.930
Let us remind them who we are

15:31.555 --> 15:34.475
and how important they are to us.

15:35.017 --> 15:36.018
Black alert.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.978
[alarm wailing]

15:39.021 --> 15:41.023
[dramatic music playing]

16:05.714 --> 16:09.635
[Detmer] Sir, we are in Lagrange one
for Ni'Var, formerly the planet Vulcan.

16:11.345 --> 16:14.098
-Incoming transmission.
-Open the channel.

16:22.940 --> 16:26.694
I am T'Rina, president of Ni'Var.

16:27.319 --> 16:28.445
[Saru] Greetings.

16:28.529 --> 16:31.865
I am Saru of the <i>U.S.S. Discovery.</i>

16:31.949 --> 16:35.953
The Federation sent word you're en route
using a unique propulsion system.

16:36.036 --> 16:39.415
I presume that is how you evaded
our long-range sensors?

16:39.498 --> 16:41.834
I assure you,
we were not attempting to evade.

16:41.917 --> 16:44.044
<i>Discovery</i> is equipped with a system

16:44.128 --> 16:46.922
that allows us to travel
across the mycelial network.

16:47.006 --> 16:50.926
We've been briefed regarding the special
circumstances of <i>Discovery's</i> crew...

16:51.885 --> 16:53.971
and your special passenger.

16:59.393 --> 17:01.145
Greetings, Madam President.

17:01.228 --> 17:04.148
I am Michael Burnham, daughter of Sarek,

17:04.648 --> 17:05.983
sister of Spock.

17:06.066 --> 17:07.651
It is an honor to greet you.

17:08.610 --> 17:12.448
I only wish Ambassador Spock could see
the fruits of his labor as you do now.

17:12.531 --> 17:16.493
I do believe
he would find it all fascinating.

17:18.620 --> 17:22.416
I would be pleased to speak further,
but first, we must dispense

17:22.499 --> 17:26.211
with the Federation's request
for data related to SB-19.

17:28.672 --> 17:33.510
We found significant new evidence
related to the cause of the Burn.

17:33.594 --> 17:35.763
SB-19 can help us with that.

17:35.846 --> 17:41.018
SB-19 is an issue of great cultural
and political sensitivity here.

17:41.101 --> 17:43.729
Our inquiry is entirely scientific
in nature.

17:43.812 --> 17:47.357
Even science cannot be separated
from cultural and political context.

17:47.441 --> 17:50.360
There are always implications,
as Spock himself learned.

17:50.444 --> 17:53.989
Ni'Var struggles with the delicate balance
of reunification,

17:54.073 --> 17:56.909
which became more complicated
after the Burn.

17:56.992 --> 18:00.704
Any theory Commander Burnham
is developing could tear open old wounds,

18:00.788 --> 18:02.581
and we cannot afford that at this time.

18:03.248 --> 18:07.336
-Madam President--
-Permission to access SB-19 is denied.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.838
If you persist in requesting it,

18:09.922 --> 18:13.342
I will have to be content
with observing your spore drive in action

18:13.425 --> 18:15.511
as you return to Federation headquarters.

18:19.973 --> 18:24.353
Madam President, do the people of Ni'Var
still honor any of the old ways,

18:24.436 --> 18:26.563
in matters of scientific inquiry?

18:28.023 --> 18:28.941
They do.

18:29.024 --> 18:31.235
Then as a graduate
of the Vulcan Science Academy,

18:31.318 --> 18:34.029
I respectfully invoke the <i>T'Kal-in-ket.</i>

18:34.571 --> 18:36.865
[tense music playing]

18:41.787 --> 18:43.413
I will convene a quorum.

18:51.338 --> 18:52.381
Commander?

18:53.048 --> 18:57.511
Vulcans have engaged in <i>T'Kal-in-ket</i>
since the time of Surak.

18:57.594 --> 19:02.015
<i>T'Kal-in-ket</i> is a philosophical process
designed to unearth deep truths,

19:02.099 --> 19:05.686
credited as being one of the engines
that led to Vulcan scientific advancement.

19:05.769 --> 19:07.104
And once invoked,

19:07.729 --> 19:09.481
the request cannot be denied.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.525
So, you gave her no choice?

19:11.608 --> 19:13.777
[Burnham] It's the only way
we'll have that data.

19:13.861 --> 19:15.529
This could help us solve the Burn.

19:17.531 --> 19:18.824
What is the protocol?

19:18.907 --> 19:21.952
I'll have to defend my hypothesis
before the Science Institute.

19:22.035 --> 19:24.413
I assume you are prepared.

19:25.038 --> 19:26.999
Of course, sir.

19:35.424 --> 19:36.758
Welcome to <i>Discovery.</i>

19:43.724 --> 19:47.477
A special chamber has been prepared
for the <i>T'Kal-in-ket.</i>

19:50.314 --> 19:51.648
Madam President,

19:52.232 --> 19:55.485
uh, will you permit me to give you
a tour of our vessel?

19:55.569 --> 19:57.654
You can forego the niceties, captain.

19:58.363 --> 20:01.408
Your commander has already
diplomatically forced me into a corner.

20:02.492 --> 20:05.913
-Your <i>shalankhkai</i> will arrive momentarily.
-My <i>shalankhkai?</i>

20:06.413 --> 20:08.332
An ancient Romulan designation.

20:08.415 --> 20:10.500
Vulcans know it as <i>sha-set.</i>

20:11.084 --> 20:12.377
Ah, my advocate.

20:12.461 --> 20:15.923
What's new since your time is that
only sisters from the Qowat Milat order

20:16.006 --> 20:18.091
can serve as advocates.

20:18.175 --> 20:20.969
Forgive me,
I'm not familiar with the Qowat Milat.

20:21.053 --> 20:24.097
[T'Rina] The Qowat Milat are
an ancient Romulan sect

20:24.181 --> 20:27.226
that live and die
by the precept of absolute candor.

20:27.309 --> 20:31.230
A necessary outgrowth of a Romulan culture
that trafficked in secrets.

20:31.313 --> 20:34.399
They were essential in helping
our ancestors trust one another

20:34.483 --> 20:36.276
during the early days of reunification.

20:36.360 --> 20:39.988
Today, they enable us to have
a healthy discourse on the planet.

20:40.530 --> 20:42.532
It's an ancient story, isn't it?

20:42.616 --> 20:46.245
My people's fates are so intertwined
and they are so similar in profound ways,

20:46.328 --> 20:48.038
yet they do not trust each other.

20:50.832 --> 20:54.670
I apologize for forcing your hand.
I meant no disrespect.

20:54.753 --> 20:55.671
You are brave.

20:57.381 --> 20:59.633
And, technically, a citizen of Ni'Var.

20:59.716 --> 21:01.426
You are within your rights,

21:01.510 --> 21:05.180
but I'm sure you are aware
that a classic tactic during <i>T'Kal-in-ket</i>

21:05.264 --> 21:08.892
is to ruthlessly assail
the credibility of the challenger.

21:08.976 --> 21:09.893
I am aware.

21:09.977 --> 21:11.687
If you are not proved to be credible,

21:11.770 --> 21:14.940
it will be known that Spock's sister
returned to us a dissembler.

21:15.023 --> 21:17.943
That will have real
and grave consequences. Do you understand?

21:18.485 --> 21:19.319
Yes, ma'am.

21:19.945 --> 21:23.907
One Qowat Milat sister has taken
a particular interest in your case.

21:23.991 --> 21:26.702
I suspect you may have
a particular interest in her as well.

21:26.785 --> 21:29.329
She'll be transporting in momentarily.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.002
Be honest,

21:36.295 --> 21:38.171
especially to yourself.

21:44.344 --> 21:46.346
[dramatic music playing]

22:04.865 --> 22:05.699
Mom?

22:07.159 --> 22:07.993
Michael!

22:11.872 --> 22:13.915
Oh, I hoped, but I never...

22:26.636 --> 22:30.057
[T'Rina] I was informed your jump
to the future is not widely known,

22:30.140 --> 22:31.683
even within Starfleet.

22:32.851 --> 22:35.562
The admiral was concerned
that it could be polarizing,

22:35.645 --> 22:36.980
given the Temporal Accords.

22:37.564 --> 22:42.903
Yet there was no other way to explain
to you the presence of Spock's sister.

22:42.986 --> 22:46.114
I confess, I am astonished
at the risk taken by your crew.

22:46.198 --> 22:49.493
-Duty called.
-I am grateful for your courage.

22:50.786 --> 22:52.412
What do you make of this future?

22:53.330 --> 22:56.750
[Saru] Well, I am troubled

22:57.626 --> 22:59.961
that the Federation is so reduced.

23:02.089 --> 23:06.635
But I am heartened that those who remain
are committed to its core values.

23:07.677 --> 23:09.596
You sound quite certain of that.

23:09.679 --> 23:14.017
I have seen their commitment to member
and non-member worlds alike.

23:15.811 --> 23:17.938
[woman on PA] <i>All personnel,</i>
<i>Cargo Bay 3...</i>

23:18.021 --> 23:19.940
Forgive me if I'm overstepping,

23:20.482 --> 23:25.278
but I know the Federation feels
the loss of Ni'Var keenly.

23:25.362 --> 23:27.114
I do hope that our visit

23:27.614 --> 23:30.408
and Commander Burnham's discussions
with the quorum

23:30.492 --> 23:34.204
will open new channels of diplomacy.

23:36.164 --> 23:38.834
That would require far more
than one visit, captain.

23:38.917 --> 23:43.463
There had been numerous issues.
SB-19 was merely the final blow.

23:45.257 --> 23:47.968
I would like to hear about them, if I may.

23:48.927 --> 23:51.221
[tender music playing]

23:51.972 --> 23:55.684
-Did you ever make it to Terralysium?
-No, landed right back on Essof IV.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.435
[chuckles] Wasn't pretty.

23:59.312 --> 24:02.023
Colonists brought me to the Qowat Milat,
who healed me.

24:03.525 --> 24:06.528
-You could use a bit of that yourself.
-What makes you say that?

24:07.988 --> 24:09.030
Well, you seem...

24:10.407 --> 24:11.575
between places.

24:13.368 --> 24:16.121
This must be some
of that absolute candor I've heard about.

24:17.205 --> 24:20.834
Actually, "between places" was
my gentle way of saying "lost."

24:21.376 --> 24:25.005
-Thought I'd ease you in.
-I'm not lost.

24:25.088 --> 24:27.257
Of course,
I'm happy to be back, um, but...

24:30.385 --> 24:33.722
But you learned to live

24:33.805 --> 24:36.099
and maybe even like
a different kind of life?

24:38.476 --> 24:39.311
Yeah.

24:40.979 --> 24:43.690
[Gabrielle] When I landed here,
the sisters helped me learn

24:43.773 --> 24:46.318
how to just be where I am.

24:47.485 --> 24:49.362
However unsettling it may be.

24:51.489 --> 24:53.283
[man on PA] <i>Lieutenant Doss,</i>
<i>please report to the bridge.</i>

24:53.366 --> 24:55.076
I don't think I fit in here anymore.

24:55.785 --> 24:58.538
Hmph. And it also sounds
like that terrifies you.

24:59.873 --> 25:02.834
-Not as much as the <i>T'Kal-in-ket.</i>
-Mm.

25:04.169 --> 25:05.503
You bit off a lot this time.

25:06.046 --> 25:07.631
I'm right.

25:07.714 --> 25:09.758
I know I'm right about this.

25:09.841 --> 25:11.176
The Burn.

25:12.135 --> 25:16.264
With your help, we can convince them
to give us the SB-19 data.

25:18.183 --> 25:19.809
You won't convince them.

25:19.893 --> 25:23.647
The sisters of the Qowat Milat
bind themselves to lost causes,

25:24.356 --> 25:27.525
and right now, there's no cause
more lost than yours.

25:27.609 --> 25:28.902
No. No, no, no.

25:28.985 --> 25:33.114
The whole point of the <i>T'Kal-in-ket</i>
is to hear facts and to use logic.

25:33.198 --> 25:36.451
-They'll see.
-[scoffs] What they need to see.

25:37.452 --> 25:38.912
Just like the rest of us.

25:39.621 --> 25:43.667
<i>N'Raj is a Romulan elder who longs</i>
<i>for greater self-governance.</i>

25:43.750 --> 25:47.045
<i>V'Kir is the young leader</i>
<i>of a sect of Vulcan purists.</i>

25:47.128 --> 25:50.799
<i>Shira speaks for the Romulo-Vulcans</i>
<i>who are trying to forge a new path here.</i>

25:50.882 --> 25:55.011
They all have their own truths, facts
and logic that are vying for air.

25:55.095 --> 25:57.389
Okay, then we appeal to V'Kir.

25:57.472 --> 26:00.976
A Vulcan purist
must at least respond to logic.

26:03.561 --> 26:05.939
I'm here for you. I am your advocate.

26:06.606 --> 26:10.318
But I would be betraying my sacred duty
if I didn't tell you the truth.

26:10.402 --> 26:13.196
You're walking in there
with a lot of blind spots.

26:14.239 --> 26:16.866
The scarcity of dilithium
was caused in part

26:16.950 --> 26:19.577
by the sheer size of the Federation.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.956
To solve that problem,
it stretched member worlds

26:23.039 --> 26:25.208
beyond capacity and comfort.

26:25.959 --> 26:27.627
In its desire to serve the many,

26:27.711 --> 26:30.797
the Federation ignored
the needs of the few.

26:31.464 --> 26:33.717
Did your ancestors not coin the phrase:

26:33.800 --> 26:36.511
"The needs of the many outweigh
the needs of the few"?

26:36.594 --> 26:39.889
When the people of Vulcan
welcomed the Romulans home,

26:39.973 --> 26:44.561
we were forced to confront centuries
of mistrust and brutality on both sides.

26:44.644 --> 26:46.688
Over time and with much effort,

26:46.771 --> 26:51.109
we earned the wisdom to know
when to let go of maxims and proverbs.

26:52.152 --> 26:56.656
Of course, but perhaps
the Federation has acquired

26:57.198 --> 26:59.367
a newfound wisdom of its own.

27:01.745 --> 27:03.538
It has been my experience

27:04.039 --> 27:09.252
that we learn our greatest lessons
when we pay a heavy price.

27:10.086 --> 27:14.799
You must admit,
the Federation has paid most dearly.

27:19.763 --> 27:21.181
The <i>T'Kal-in ket</i> is this way.

27:24.601 --> 27:26.603
[gong ringing]

27:38.239 --> 27:40.241
[suspenseful music playing]

27:53.213 --> 27:57.634
Thank you, quorum members
and peers, N'Raj, Shira and V'Kir.

27:57.717 --> 28:00.303
Thank you, Qowat Milat Sister Gabrielle.

28:00.387 --> 28:04.099
Our purpose here
is the excavation of truth,

28:05.225 --> 28:08.853
tested by the scientific rigors
of logic and fact.

28:10.230 --> 28:12.982
So, let us begin with the facts.

28:13.066 --> 28:16.277
We've already received and reviewed
the data around your presentation

28:16.361 --> 28:17.612
and found it lacking.

28:18.196 --> 28:20.907
I move to dismiss and end this quorum.

28:21.699 --> 28:24.369
But, Peer V'Kir,
you have not fully heard me out.

28:24.452 --> 28:26.079
In deference to Ambassador Spock,

28:26.162 --> 28:28.289
I prefer not to speak
in such terms to you.

28:28.832 --> 28:31.501
But I will point out
the puerility in your findings.

28:31.584 --> 28:34.170
Ni'Var Science Institute
has never disputed

28:34.254 --> 28:36.256
that there's a source of the Burn.

28:36.339 --> 28:38.049
If that is your new theory,

28:38.133 --> 28:40.301
there is no need to waste our time.

28:40.385 --> 28:42.595
But you think that the Burn started here.

28:42.679 --> 28:45.390
I have evidence
that shows that cannot be true.

28:45.473 --> 28:47.976
How long has the Federation
had evidence of this?

28:48.059 --> 28:50.437
A great deal of suffering
may have been avoided.

28:50.520 --> 28:53.022
I uncovered this last bit of evidence
only days ago.

28:53.106 --> 28:56.151
[V'Kir] Her findings are based
on fractions of microseconds

28:56.234 --> 28:59.529
on the Burn-destruction time stamps
of three starships.

28:59.612 --> 29:03.408
Across thousands of light-years,
those numbers could've been skewed.

29:03.491 --> 29:05.869
We have accounted for subatomic lensing.

29:05.952 --> 29:08.246
Her miniscule sample size
is inconsequential

29:08.329 --> 29:11.416
compared to what the Ni'Var
Science Institute has already collected.

29:11.499 --> 29:14.544
-Then why won't you share that data?
-[Shira] The data is sensitive in nature.

29:14.627 --> 29:17.505
We cannot risk it falling
into the wrong hands.

29:17.589 --> 29:20.133
We cannot risk
how the Federation may use it.

29:20.216 --> 29:22.302
Carrying the weight of responsibility
for the Burn

29:22.385 --> 29:25.054
has created great hardship for our planet.

29:25.555 --> 29:27.265
-If they can prove--
-Peer N'Raj,

29:27.348 --> 29:29.976
given the unrest in your own province,

29:30.059 --> 29:34.564
how can you dispute that knowledge
in the wrong hands is a dangerous thing?

29:35.440 --> 29:38.610
And, Peer Shira,
how many additional resources

29:38.693 --> 29:39.778
have the Vulcans spent

29:39.861 --> 29:43.156
quashing insurgencies
in the Romulo-Vulcan regions?

29:44.115 --> 29:46.409
We cannot allow further unrest.

29:47.076 --> 29:49.704
Peer V'Kir, my brother would have
found it illogical

29:49.788 --> 29:52.332
to sacrifice knowledge to avoid risk.

29:52.415 --> 29:54.751
She invokes her own brother in an effort

29:54.834 --> 29:57.504
to win us to her cause
through emotional appeal.

29:57.587 --> 29:59.964
This is a forum for logic,
Commander Burnham.

30:00.048 --> 30:03.718
If there is even a chance
we aren't responsible for the Burn,

30:04.844 --> 30:08.681
we must join the investigation
and share our evidence.

30:08.765 --> 30:13.770
I would be willing to consider that,
but I'm not convinced of your motives.

30:13.853 --> 30:16.898
I want the truth. Nothing more.

30:17.732 --> 30:18.566
For whom?

30:19.526 --> 30:22.278
For the Federation or yourself?

30:23.696 --> 30:25.031
For all of us.

30:25.114 --> 30:28.034
This is immaterial
and beyond the scope of this debate.

30:28.117 --> 30:32.539
I am the chair of this quorum,
and I move to dismiss.

30:32.622 --> 30:35.124
Peer V'Kir has made a motion to dismiss.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.710
-Is there consensus?
-There is not.

30:37.794 --> 30:39.420
I'll abstain at this time.

30:39.504 --> 30:43.842
Three quorum members,
three opinions, no consensus.

30:43.925 --> 30:47.470
Let us take a moment to adjourn
to be in our thoughts.

30:50.974 --> 30:53.184
None of these canisters should be empty.

30:53.268 --> 30:56.521
-Take them to the storage bay. Please.
-[man] Aye, commander.

30:56.604 --> 30:57.939
What's that look?

30:58.022 --> 30:59.482
I need to talk to you.

31:04.988 --> 31:08.199
Saru asked me
to be his acting First Officer.

31:14.664 --> 31:18.877
So, that would make you
my superior officer?

31:18.960 --> 31:19.794
Yeah.

31:21.546 --> 31:23.840
Position only, not in rank.

31:23.923 --> 31:27.760
Most of this crew
has more experience than me, so...

31:28.887 --> 31:32.849
I guess I'm just, like, wondering, like,
um, what you would think about...

31:35.685 --> 31:36.978
me taking it.

31:38.938 --> 31:42.692
Honestly, the notion
of taking orders from you

31:43.610 --> 31:45.361
is deeply, deeply weird.

31:45.445 --> 31:47.947
Almost, uh, disturbing.

31:49.616 --> 31:52.035
What's your ETA
on recalibrating for the jump back?

31:52.118 --> 31:54.203
Tell Detmer to relax. I'll be ready.

31:54.287 --> 31:57.332
-I need to--
-Yeah. I know. Thank you. Sorry. Thanks.

31:57.415 --> 31:59.417
[chamber opens]

31:59.500 --> 32:01.920
[Burnham] V'Kir made up his mind
before he set foot here.

32:02.003 --> 32:04.213
He believes he's protecting his homeworld.

32:04.297 --> 32:07.550
Engaging with you means
moving closer to the Federation.

32:07.634 --> 32:09.928
He's weighing that as well. They all are.

32:10.011 --> 32:12.347
He claims to be a follower of Spock.

32:13.056 --> 32:17.018
-That means seeking the truth.
-He opened himself up and spoke the truth.

32:17.101 --> 32:19.062
As did I. I'm being truthful.

32:19.145 --> 32:22.440
Not as truthful as you were with me
about whether or not you fit here.

32:22.982 --> 32:25.276
-That's personal.
-It's relevant.

32:25.860 --> 32:27.987
I thought you were advocating for me.

32:28.071 --> 32:29.447
What do you think I am doing?

32:29.530 --> 32:31.449
But this is a lost cause? Right?

32:31.532 --> 32:33.993
They are not
the only audience in the room.

32:34.535 --> 32:36.704
You are Qowat Milat

32:38.122 --> 32:39.666
and you are my mother.

32:42.001 --> 32:45.964
Tell them that you know me.
Tell them I can be trusted.

32:46.631 --> 32:47.465
I'm sorry.

32:48.132 --> 32:52.679
Based on what you're not telling them,
you cannot be trusted.

32:55.139 --> 32:57.141
[suspenseful music playing]

33:00.520 --> 33:01.688
[gong ringing]

33:01.771 --> 33:04.524
[woman]<i> </i>The<i> </i>T'Kal-in-ket resumes.

33:14.325 --> 33:15.159
I...

33:21.207 --> 33:24.252
I have presented data
that I believe shows that the Burn

33:25.378 --> 33:27.296
was not caused by SB-19.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.885
However, it is true that...

33:35.304 --> 33:36.764
I cannot be sure.

33:42.562 --> 33:44.564
With humility, I ask for your help.

33:46.232 --> 33:49.610
And we are telling you that the SB-19 data

33:49.694 --> 33:52.572
definitively concludes
that the Burn started here.

33:54.073 --> 33:55.408
Why don't you believe us?

33:55.491 --> 33:59.537
Commander Burnham, are you speaking
on behalf of the Federation?

33:59.620 --> 34:01.706
Yes, I am.

34:01.789 --> 34:05.376
[Shira] Then everything you say
must be weighted with that fact.

34:05.460 --> 34:09.047
Ni'Var did not take the decision
to leave the Federation lightly.

34:09.130 --> 34:13.342
You are asking us to trust
that they will not use our data unwisely,

34:13.426 --> 34:16.721
that they will not resume
the original experiment.

34:16.804 --> 34:18.681
[audience murmuring]

34:18.765 --> 34:20.308
That is a big ask.

34:20.391 --> 34:21.392
I know.

34:24.062 --> 34:25.772
But the Federation can be trusted.

34:28.399 --> 34:31.569
She's asking this quorum
to take what she says on faith.

34:32.653 --> 34:35.490
She demands trust,
while her own actions are cynical.

34:38.451 --> 34:41.496
I only seek to share information
that can better both of our futures.

34:41.579 --> 34:43.372
And we should believe you?

34:44.415 --> 34:45.249
Yes.

34:45.333 --> 34:47.126
[Gabrielle] Because you are honest
when you say

34:47.210 --> 34:50.296
the Federation has
Ni'Var's best intentions at heart?

34:50.379 --> 34:51.339
Yes.

34:51.422 --> 34:55.468
But your own story is completely
incongruous to those assertions.

34:55.551 --> 34:56.427
What?

34:56.511 --> 35:00.973
Didn't you mutiny against your friend
and mentor, Captain Philippa Georgiou,

35:01.057 --> 35:02.767
at the Battle of the Binary Stars

35:02.850 --> 35:05.228
so you could deal
with the Klingons as you saw fit?

35:05.311 --> 35:08.648
-Yes, but they--
-Didn't she ultimately die in that battle?

35:11.526 --> 35:12.360
Yes.

35:12.443 --> 35:14.487
[Gabrielle] Less than 48 hours ago,

35:14.570 --> 35:17.740
you were relieved of your duty
as First Officer again

35:17.824 --> 35:21.702
for disobeying yet another direct command
from yet another captain.

35:22.328 --> 35:26.124
This is who the Federation sends us
after nearly a century.

35:26.207 --> 35:29.669
And just moments ago,
she shared her misgivings with me

35:29.752 --> 35:32.004
about whether or not
she even belongs here.

35:32.088 --> 35:34.173
-Isn't that true?
-It's not that simple.

35:34.257 --> 35:35.424
It is.

35:36.008 --> 35:37.218
So, I will ask again.

35:37.301 --> 35:39.053
Why does this quorum,

35:39.137 --> 35:44.892
why does anyone have any reason
to trust you or the Federation?

35:53.276 --> 35:57.655
Distinguished Peers, let me speak truth
to you because she is unable to.

35:58.239 --> 36:00.616
She did not have the childhood
I would've wished for her.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.326
I orphaned her.

36:03.703 --> 36:06.747
She may have grown up here,
but she was never Vulcan.

36:06.831 --> 36:09.709
She is human, through and through.

36:09.792 --> 36:13.254
And being human,
she is governed by emotion

36:13.337 --> 36:16.674
and a desire to insinuate herself
into certain matters of import

36:16.757 --> 36:18.593
to fill an emotional void.

36:18.676 --> 36:21.888
I maintain that that void
has made her vulnerable to manipulation

36:21.971 --> 36:23.264
by the Federation.

36:23.347 --> 36:25.308
I am not being manipulated.

36:25.391 --> 36:28.895
Then you admit to letting them exploit
the fact that you're Spock's sister?

36:28.978 --> 36:31.397
I would never disrespect my brother.
You know that.

36:31.480 --> 36:34.942
Your methods and motives are clouded.
Even to yourself.

36:35.026 --> 36:37.862
You demanded this quorum
without resolving to be honest.

36:37.945 --> 36:43.326
You thought I would not fulfill my duty
to truth because I am your mother.

36:45.077 --> 36:46.245
But you're mistaken.

36:46.996 --> 36:49.290
[tense music playing]

36:49.373 --> 36:52.043
Fine. There are things
I didn't willingly share.

36:52.126 --> 36:55.630
But as my Qowat Milat advocate,
I demand that you confirm the truth.

36:55.713 --> 36:58.966
Didn't the Federation give me
a mission and a purpose?

36:59.050 --> 37:00.468
-Yes.
-Didn't the Federation

37:00.551 --> 37:02.803
give me a place and a family?

37:02.887 --> 37:05.681
-Yes.
-Didn't my crew and I risk our lives?

37:05.765 --> 37:09.310
And work together in the past
to save all sentient life in the universe?

37:09.894 --> 37:10.937
[Gabrielle] That is true.

37:11.020 --> 37:14.774
And isn't it true that the only reason
we are all sitting here today

37:14.857 --> 37:17.610
is because the Federation gave
the <i>U.S.S. Discovery</i>

37:17.693 --> 37:20.488
the resources and the mandate
to solve the biggest,

37:20.571 --> 37:23.074
most troublesome problems in the galaxy?

37:23.157 --> 37:24.200
Yes.

37:25.117 --> 37:28.913
Didn't you see all of us,
imperfect and flawed as we all are,

37:28.996 --> 37:33.334
-still live up to its best ideals?
-Yes, I did.

37:33.417 --> 37:36.254
So, I may question and I may fear

37:36.796 --> 37:39.048
because the problems
often seem insurmountable.

37:39.131 --> 37:42.176
-But haven't we always risen to meet them?
-Yes.

37:42.260 --> 37:45.554
Why don't you believe me when I say
it is the greater good I am fighting for,

37:45.638 --> 37:48.099
that I have always been fighting for?

37:48.182 --> 37:51.143
Then why are you struggling
with whether or not you belong here?

38:01.988 --> 38:02.989
I don't know.

38:06.033 --> 38:08.411
Maybe because the stakes
are so much higher now.

38:12.206 --> 38:13.541
Everything is different.

38:15.835 --> 38:17.420
And every day, there's this fear,

38:19.046 --> 38:21.632
this fear that I'm doing it wrong.

38:24.802 --> 38:28.222
Like I'll destroy the people I love.

38:30.683 --> 38:32.893
What if I lose everything and everyone?

38:34.353 --> 38:36.522
After all we've sacrificed.

38:39.025 --> 38:39.859
I know.

38:44.071 --> 38:46.240
Now she speaks truthfully.

38:51.037 --> 38:52.747
I thank you for your candor,

38:53.664 --> 38:54.498
daughter.

38:55.791 --> 38:59.920
I appreciate your sentiments,
but candor will not prevent another Burn.

39:00.588 --> 39:04.342
Our society only wants stability
and peace.

39:04.425 --> 39:06.635
Peer V'Kir, we are to determine

39:06.719 --> 39:10.848
if we're going to share the SB-19 data
based on scientific evidence.

39:10.931 --> 39:14.143
We are not here to decide
what our society wants.

39:14.226 --> 39:16.145
Vulcans will choose
whatever serves them best

39:16.228 --> 39:17.813
and insist it is only logical.

39:17.897 --> 39:20.649
If the Vulcans won't share their data,
then the Romulans will.

39:20.733 --> 39:22.401
[audience murmuring]

39:23.319 --> 39:24.653
[Shira] My brothers!

39:24.737 --> 39:26.447
Peer N'Raj, this is not the way.

39:26.530 --> 39:28.949
What way do you know?
You sit in the middle,

39:29.033 --> 39:31.160
-trying to be everything and nothing.
-Friends!

39:34.246 --> 39:36.665
This is not
what my brother would have wanted.

39:37.792 --> 39:40.044
He revealed the connection
between your cultures.

39:40.127 --> 39:42.004
I implore you, don't lose that.

39:42.088 --> 39:44.340
Clearly more tenuous than we'd realized.

39:45.466 --> 39:48.260
-Perhaps it is already lost.
-[Burnham] No.

39:49.553 --> 39:50.763
No, it is not.

39:52.014 --> 39:55.017
Spock believed you could create
something bigger than yourselves.

39:55.101 --> 39:56.769
That's what this quorum is.

39:57.561 --> 39:59.105
That's what Ni'Var is.

40:02.983 --> 40:04.318
That's what the Federation is.

40:06.946 --> 40:08.864
[T'Rina] You represent the Federation,

40:10.157 --> 40:13.494
yet you invoke Ambassador Spock,
who left it behind.

40:14.370 --> 40:19.250
Doesn't mean he didn't love it.
Doesn't mean he wouldn't have returned.

40:20.876 --> 40:24.588
How and if he understood love
is something we can never know.

40:26.132 --> 40:27.383
I think I might know.

40:34.765 --> 40:37.101
The Burn nearly destroyed the Federation.

40:39.311 --> 40:43.607
I will not add the peace of Ni'Var
to its list of casualties.

40:49.947 --> 40:51.824
I withdraw my request.

40:52.825 --> 40:54.034
[rings]

40:56.620 --> 40:57.830
What about the data?

40:59.707 --> 41:00.666
I'll keep searching.

41:01.208 --> 41:03.878
I'll send whatever I find
to the Ni'Var Science Institute.

41:03.961 --> 41:07.882
You can do with it what you want.
I ask you for nothing.

41:11.010 --> 41:15.806
But I am giving you my trust,
as a member of Starfleet.

41:22.062 --> 41:24.064
[dramatic music playing]

41:49.256 --> 41:50.925
[door chimes]

41:51.008 --> 41:51.884
[sighs]

41:52.593 --> 41:53.427
Come in.

42:00.726 --> 42:02.645
I got where you were going back there.

42:04.522 --> 42:07.066
You could've picked a better time
to do some parenting.

42:07.149 --> 42:09.109
Is this what you were like
as a 12-year-old?

42:16.075 --> 42:19.453
You know, the first thing you told me
after all this time...

42:22.164 --> 42:25.376
was that you didn't know how you fit in
with your family anymore.

42:27.670 --> 42:31.590
Michael, you don't need to choose
between the person you used to be

42:31.674 --> 42:33.300
and the person you are now.

42:34.301 --> 42:35.261
You shouldn't.

42:36.220 --> 42:38.347
Duty and joy go hand in hand.

42:38.430 --> 42:41.934
Duty is there so you can continue
to pursue your happiness,

42:42.017 --> 42:43.352
and joy is there

42:44.270 --> 42:46.689
so that you have something real
to fight for.

42:47.606 --> 42:49.608
[tender music playing]

42:54.488 --> 42:55.489
So, what now?

42:56.240 --> 42:58.701
I told you there was another audience.

42:59.910 --> 43:03.497
When President T'Rina saw you,
when you let her see you,

43:06.333 --> 43:09.545
she decided that trusting you
was worth the risk.

43:18.304 --> 43:22.308
And she also said she wondered
how much of the man Spock became

43:23.183 --> 43:25.686
was the result of who his sister was.

43:45.122 --> 43:47.333
You're staying on Ni'Var, aren't you?

43:48.459 --> 43:50.044
I can't be bound to you.

43:51.670 --> 43:53.339
You're not a lost cause.

43:55.758 --> 43:58.510
But I finally get a chance
to say something to you

43:59.011 --> 44:01.930
that I've wanted to say
for a very long time.

44:04.850 --> 44:07.311
You always know where to find me.

44:18.155 --> 44:19.281
You wanted to see me?

44:25.162 --> 44:27.289
-You told them?
-Of course I told them.

44:27.790 --> 44:30.876
I-- I haven't given an answer yet.

44:30.959 --> 44:32.044
Say yes.

44:32.628 --> 44:34.546
-But I--
-Say yes.

44:35.214 --> 44:37.466
-Say yes.
-Say yes.

44:38.050 --> 44:40.177
-Say yes.
-Just say it!

44:42.763 --> 44:43.597
Really?

44:49.019 --> 44:51.563
-Why?
-Because...

44:51.647 --> 44:56.276
we know you, and knowing you,
we'd all follow you anywhere.

44:56.819 --> 44:58.695
Saru made the right choice.

44:59.613 --> 45:02.491
Well, I'm gonna need all of your help.

45:02.574 --> 45:08.330
Of course. But first, we'd like to present
a list of grievances and requests.

45:08.414 --> 45:09.706
-[woman] Yes.
-[Rhys] I need

45:09.790 --> 45:12.376
two weeks' leave on Earth.
A place called Hawaii.

45:13.293 --> 45:15.712
Yeah, the head
in my 'fresher's leaking, so...

45:15.796 --> 45:17.923
I'd like quarters with a window.

45:18.006 --> 45:21.927
I'd like you to assign someone
to help me analyze all this SB-19 data.

45:22.010 --> 45:23.804
-No. You got it?
-[Burnham chuckles]

45:23.887 --> 45:25.931
[Tilly] Oh! That's amazing!

45:29.601 --> 45:31.228
I really wanted to tell you...

45:31.311 --> 45:33.105
Oh, did I miss the cool "say yes" part?

45:34.815 --> 45:36.191
I'm sorry I'm late.

45:37.401 --> 45:40.446
-I just wanted your blessing.
-No, you don't need that.

45:42.156 --> 45:43.740
How can I make it easier?

45:44.491 --> 45:45.534
You lead me.

45:48.620 --> 45:50.372
Wait, you mean, you're not leaving?

45:54.918 --> 45:56.462
I'm here for the duration.

45:59.089 --> 46:00.215
[Burnham chuckles]

46:06.638 --> 46:08.182
Commander Burnham,

46:08.265 --> 46:11.351
I want you to take that data
to the science lab immediately.

46:11.435 --> 46:14.563
You are going to figure out
what caused the Burn

46:14.646 --> 46:16.607
and help to rebuild the Federation.

46:16.690 --> 46:18.358
-Yeah.
-Yes. Yes!

46:22.654 --> 46:23.655
We all will.

46:27.701 --> 46:30.662
Thought you were going to ask me
to switch my bed to the other side.

46:30.746 --> 46:32.206
Yeah, no, that's happening.

46:32.289 --> 46:34.208
Oh, well, whatever you say, Number One.

46:34.291 --> 46:36.502
[Tilly and Burnham laugh]

46:37.127 --> 46:38.420
[T'Rina] Thank you, captain.

46:39.254 --> 46:40.130
This has been...

46:41.423 --> 46:44.134
quite different from what I expected.

46:49.348 --> 46:50.682
That was a compliment.

46:52.351 --> 46:53.185
Ah.

46:54.228 --> 46:55.187
If I may...

46:57.105 --> 47:00.400
I understand
the situation on Ni'Var is complex.

47:00.484 --> 47:03.111
Contemplating a future
within the Federation

47:03.612 --> 47:06.114
may be premature at this time.

47:06.198 --> 47:07.115
However...

47:08.575 --> 47:09.826
I would very much appreciate

47:09.910 --> 47:13.247
the opportunity to continue
our conversation.

47:13.330 --> 47:14.581
As would I.

47:15.666 --> 47:16.542
In time.

47:18.126 --> 47:19.628
Thank you, Madam President.

47:22.047 --> 47:24.550
Live long and prosper, Captain Saru.

47:36.061 --> 47:38.063
[tender music playing]

47:44.820 --> 47:47.030
-You got the data, didn't you?
-I did.

47:47.114 --> 47:48.699
And you're not leaving, are you?

47:49.741 --> 47:50.576
No.

47:58.625 --> 47:59.668
I belong here.

48:03.505 --> 48:04.506
With this crew.

48:08.302 --> 48:09.595
True believer, right?

48:15.809 --> 48:17.019
What does that mean for you?

48:21.440 --> 48:22.566
I don't know.

48:23.609 --> 48:25.611
[purring]

48:30.741 --> 48:32.200
You feel like home.

48:34.328 --> 48:35.162
So do you.

49:02.105 --> 49:04.107
