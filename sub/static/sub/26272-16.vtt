You're being charged with
violation of trademark laws.

Selling counterfeit goods.

My name is Chunk Palmer and
I'll be your public defender.

02:05.192 --> 02:07.706
I should also inform you
that while I'm not yet

02:07.730 --> 02:09.741
a fully-licensed criminal attorney,

02:09.764 --> 02:11.576
and I've yet to pass the bar,

02:11.600 --> 02:13.445
I'm participating in a law school clinic

02:13.469 --> 02:16.548
supervised by a professor
and a licensed attorney

02:16.572 --> 02:19.284

by the New York City courts.

not a real lawyer?

Well, the city thinks I'm real enough.

Look, Mister...

02:26.816 --> 02:29.161
Lambert, I assure you, (CHUCKLES)

02:29.185 --> 02:31.863
you will not find an attorney
who will work harder for you.

02:31.887 --> 02:34.266
You'll be my only client,
my sole concern.

02:34.290 --> 02:36.034
Do I have a choice?

02:36.480 --> 02:38.537
Well, you can hire
your own counsel if you'd like.

02:38.561 --> 02:40.005
But that costs money, right?

02:40.029 --> 02:41.306
Well, what can I say?

02:41.330 --> 02:42.774
Look, everybody starts somewhere.

02:42.798 --> 02:44.309
Everyone has their first case.

02:44.333 --> 02:46.011
Your first case?

02:46.650 --> 02:48.714
So, according to this,

02:48.738 --> 02:49.881
you were arrested

02:49.905 --> 02:51.550
with someone named Raymond Hill?

02:51.574 --> 02:54.886
Yeah. Raymond... he's...
he's like a friend of a friend.

02:54.910 --> 02:56.455
A guy from the neighborhood.

02:56.479 --> 02:58.423
He's the one that got me into it.

02:58.447 --> 03:00.692
He brings the goods, I do the selling,

03:00.716 --> 03:02.594
but it's not stolen or nothing.

03:02.618 --> 03:03.995
Come on, man.

03:04.019 --> 03:06.331
Someone shows up with designer
goods in cardboard boxes,

03:06.355 --> 03:08.667
and you don't smell something's up?

03:08.691 --> 03:10.257

03:10.960 --> 03:13.004
my grandfather owns a barbershop.

problems... taxes were due,

03:15.798 --> 03:16.975
bills were piling up.

03:16.999 --> 03:18.744
I was just wanting to help out.

03:18.768 --> 03:20.645
Raymond... he kept coming by the-the shop

03:20.669 --> 03:22.280
when we were closing, and-and saying

03:22.304 --> 03:24.950
that he had a way
I could make some fast cash...

03:24.974 --> 03:26.551
- Selling counterfeit handbags.
- Yeah.

03:26.575 --> 03:28.653
And watches and-and sneakers.

03:28.677 --> 03:31.456
And I said no,
but he kept coming by the shop

03:31.480 --> 03:32.858
with this merchandise.

03:32.882 --> 03:35.293
Fancy-ass names, fancy-ass designs.

03:35.317 --> 03:38.371
- And, finally, I said yes.
- Come on, man.

03:38.395 --> 03:40.098
You had to know they were knock-offs.

03:40.122 --> 03:42.539
I knew, but so do my customers.

03:43.125 --> 03:46.261
I figured it couldn't be a crime
if everyone was in on it.

03:48.030 --> 03:49.641
All right.

03:49.665 --> 03:51.777
Look, I'm-I'm gonna go find a marshal,

03:51.801 --> 03:54.513
and we're gonna get you arraigned.

03:54.537 --> 03:56.615
Your Honor, counterfeiting
is a trillion dollar industry.

03:56.639 --> 03:59.351
It's the largest criminal
enterprise in the world.

03:59.375 --> 04:00.986
And it's not a victimless crime.

04:01.010 --> 04:03.855
It involves the theft
of intellectual property.

04:03.879 --> 04:06.191
The goods are often made
in factories that rely on

04:06.215 --> 04:08.560
child labor and human trafficking, and

04:08.584 --> 04:10.729
frequently, the profits are used
to fund terrorist organizations.

04:10.753 --> 04:12.063
Your Honor, my client is not a terrorist.

04:12.087 --> 04:13.799
That's not what I'm implying.

04:13.823 --> 04:16.000
You'll get your turn, sir.

04:16.572 --> 04:19.271
I understand the severity of the charges.

04:19.295 --> 04:21.072
Is there a request for bail?

04:21.096 --> 04:22.630
$5,000 cash.

04:24.033 --> 04:25.544
I'll hear arguments.

04:25.874 --> 04:28.146
This is not Mr. Lambert's
first brush with the law.

04:28.170 --> 04:29.381
He was convicted

04:29.405 --> 04:31.583
four years ago for stealing a car.

04:31.607 --> 04:33.251
I'll hear you on bail.

04:33.632 --> 04:35.120
Thank you, Your Honor.

04:35.144 --> 04:37.789
My name is Chunk Palmer,
student defender,

04:38.220 --> 04:40.192
and I represent Mr. Lambert.

04:40.216 --> 04:43.595
And just to provide a little
context for the larceny charge,

04:43.619 --> 04:46.665
he was a juvenile
and it was his sister's car.

04:46.689 --> 04:49.034
Nonetheless, he's still on
probation for that case.

04:49.058 --> 04:50.836
So, if he's convicted in this case,

04:50.860 --> 04:52.370
he'd be violating that probation,

04:52.394 --> 04:53.839
which could mean an additional sentence.

04:53.863 --> 04:56.875
The purpose of the bail statute
is to assure

04:56.899 --> 04:58.743
the defendant's return
to court for trial.

04:59.366 --> 05:01.613
My client will most certainly
return, as he is eager

05:01.637 --> 05:03.548
to litigate the allegations against him.

05:04.449 --> 05:06.513
He is the furthest thing
from a flight risk.

05:06.957 --> 05:09.016
He has deep roots in the community.

05:09.040 --> 05:11.752
In fact, he's lived in the same
neighborhood his entire life.

05:11.776 --> 05:14.012
Give me a dollar amount.

05:14.036 --> 05:16.323
Actually, I'm requesting
that he be released

05:16.347 --> 05:18.148
on his own personal recognizance.

05:22.973 --> 05:24.531
Okay.

05:24.555 --> 05:25.841
Excuse me?

05:25.865 --> 05:28.368
I find your request to be reasonable.

Oh, by the way, this is my boss,

08:59.206 --> 09:01.451
Unfortunately, I can't.
I'm only allowed one case.

09:01.475 --> 09:03.334
Maybe we could find
a new public defender?

09:03.358 --> 09:06.055
No. Fighting the forfeiture
is a civil matter.

09:06.079 --> 09:09.392
You're only entitled to a public
defender in criminal cases.

09:09.416 --> 09:12.261
Hell, I can't afford a lawyer.

09:12.869 --> 09:15.465
Hey, you guys can't just stand here.

09:15.489 --> 09:17.667
Disperse, or I'll put you under arrest.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.035
BULL: Hey.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.737
I think you need to talk to me.

09:20.761 --> 09:21.875
And who are you?

09:21.899 --> 09:23.406
My name is Dr. Jason Bull,

09:23.430 --> 09:25.308
and my firms represents the man
who actually owns

09:25.332 --> 09:27.410
this shop, Mister...

09:27.434 --> 09:28.510
Lambert.

09:29.436 --> 09:31.781
William Lambert, owner and proprietor.

09:31.805 --> 09:34.117
BULL: Not the grandson you
busted for selling

09:34.141 --> 09:35.318
knock-offs out the back door,

09:35.342 --> 09:37.487
and not this gentleman,
who's representing him.

09:37.511 --> 09:39.355
Me, who you're gonna face in court

09:39.379 --> 09:42.492
if you don't vacate this man's
private property now.

09:42.516 --> 09:44.127
You want to go to court with the FBI?

09:44.151 --> 09:47.030
Question is does the FBI
want to go to court with me?

09:47.054 --> 09:48.498
I have no idea who you are, sir,

09:48.522 --> 09:50.833
but my answer would be an emphatic yes.

09:50.857 --> 09:52.659
I'll see you in court.

10:03.595 --> 10:05.354
Knock, knock, knock.

10:05.354 --> 10:08.367
Hey, Dr. Bull wanted me
to see if you needed any help.

10:08.391 --> 10:10.202
- Any investigative assistance?
- Oh...

10:10.226 --> 10:12.404
We're running a one-time only
special for rookie lawyers.

10:12.428 --> 10:14.840
Nice. Yeah. I need you to investigate

10:14.864 --> 10:16.372
how I can get this case dismissed.

10:16.373 --> 10:18.539
Oh, that's the attitude.
Surrender before the attack.

10:18.563 --> 10:20.220
No, I'm serious.

10:20.244 --> 10:21.955
They caught this kid dead to rights.

10:21.979 --> 10:25.158
I have no idea how I'm gonna defend him.

10:25.182 --> 10:28.057
Who knew selling knock-offs
was such a heinous crime?

10:28.081 --> 10:30.163
Yeah. It's funny. When I was at Vogue,

10:30.187 --> 10:32.165
I saw all kinds
of counterfeit everything.

10:32.189 --> 10:35.168
I mean, some of the stuff, you
could barely tell the difference

10:35.192 --> 10:37.293
between the fake and the real thing.

10:38.996 --> 10:40.440
(SIGHS)

10:40.464 --> 10:42.108
You know...

10:42.132 --> 10:44.144
maybe if I could prove that this kid

10:44.168 --> 10:47.681
was selling really bad replicas,
I really could get the court

10:47.705 --> 10:49.749
to dismiss the whole case.

10:50.425 --> 10:52.285
I don't follow. On what grounds?

10:52.309 --> 10:54.020
Well, I might be able to argue

10:54.044 --> 10:56.356
that Darius's knockoffs
were so poorly made

10:56.380 --> 10:58.692
that there's no way
that anyone could confuse them

10:58.716 --> 11:00.060
with the real thing.

11:00.084 --> 11:01.394
Mm.

11:02.987 --> 11:04.965
Is there any chance I could convince you

11:04.989 --> 11:07.334
to go downtown to the FBI evidence room

11:07.358 --> 11:10.804
and... check out
the merchandise first-hand?

11:11.196 --> 11:13.489
All part of the rookie lawyer special.

11:30.481 --> 11:32.382
♪

11:48.666 --> 11:51.811
Yeah. Well, let me discuss it
with Bull and Benny.

11:51.835 --> 11:53.046
Yeah.

11:53.070 --> 11:54.822
See you tonight.

11:55.439 --> 11:56.839
(SIGHS)

11:57.908 --> 11:59.753
That was Danny.

11:59.777 --> 12:02.489
She said all the merchandise she
saw looked pretty convincing.

12:02.513 --> 12:04.624
Apparently I'm not gonna be able
to get this case dismissed

12:04.648 --> 12:06.192
because the goods don't look good enough.

12:06.216 --> 12:08.770
- Mm.
- Here come our clients.

12:10.187 --> 12:12.732
She also told me
that some of the handbags

12:12.756 --> 12:14.567
that they confiscated from Darius

12:14.591 --> 12:16.636
have other older
evidence tags inside of them.

12:16.660 --> 12:18.972
Almost like they've been used
as evidence before

12:18.996 --> 12:20.173
in other cases.

12:20.197 --> 12:21.808
That doesn't make any sense.

12:21.832 --> 12:22.976
She's photographing everything,

12:23.000 --> 12:24.878
so we'll be able
to compare notes tonight.

12:24.902 --> 12:27.614
BENNY: <i>Your Honor,</i> the
asset forfeiture laws

12:27.638 --> 12:30.917
were intended to stop
drug dealers who use...

12:30.941 --> 12:34.621
cars and planes and boats
to transport contraband.

12:35.154 --> 12:36.690
My client doesn't sell drugs.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.224
He cuts hair.

12:38.248 --> 12:40.894
Clearly, this is
a gross misuse of this law.

12:40.918 --> 12:43.029
Your Honor, this hearing
is supposed to be

12:43.053 --> 12:44.264
about an injunction.

12:44.288 --> 12:47.834
We are not here to argue
the legality of the seizure.

12:47.858 --> 12:49.636
But we should be.

12:49.660 --> 12:53.173
Taking Mr. Lambert's barbershop
without a fair hearing is

12:53.197 --> 12:55.909
a violation of his fundamental
right to due process.

12:55.933 --> 12:57.077
I've read your brief,

12:57.101 --> 12:58.712
and I'm afraid I agree
with the plaintiff.

12:58.736 --> 13:01.147
BENNY: Your Honor, respectfully...

13:01.171 --> 13:03.616
the government took my client's
only source of income.

13:04.058 --> 13:05.785
How is he supposed to survive?

13:05.809 --> 13:08.988
Even if he wins this case, he
will be so behind on his bills

13:09.012 --> 13:11.057
that he will still lose his business.

13:11.081 --> 13:13.827
Be that as it may, I'm going
to deny the defendant's motion.

13:13.851 --> 13:15.261
But, given your concerns

13:15.285 --> 13:18.565
about due process,
I can fast-track this case.

13:19.115 --> 13:20.600
Trial begins tomorrow.

13:20.624 --> 13:22.235
We're adjourned.

13:22.259 --> 13:24.371
I only see one way to go on this.

13:24.746 --> 13:26.806
The "innocent owner" defense.
We argue that the government

13:26.830 --> 13:28.708
had no right to take Willie's property

13:28.732 --> 13:30.477
because, A, he didn't do anything wrong

13:30.501 --> 13:33.113
and, B, he didn't know anything
criminal was taking place

13:33.137 --> 13:35.382
- on his property.
- BENNY: Eh. Problem is

13:35.406 --> 13:37.250
we have to prove a negative.

13:37.633 --> 13:39.018
How do you mean?

13:39.042 --> 13:40.920
Well, we have to convince a jury

13:40.944 --> 13:43.723
that Willie didn't know
what Darius was doing.

13:43.747 --> 13:45.725
Right? That's a negative.

13:45.749 --> 13:48.528
It's really hard to prove
what someone didn't know.

13:48.552 --> 13:50.063
(KNOCKING)

13:50.087 --> 13:52.899
If you come bearing food, enter.

13:52.923 --> 13:54.200
No food. Not yet.

13:54.224 --> 13:56.569
But I do come bearing
an interesting factoid.

13:56.593 --> 13:59.105
- We'll be the judge of that.
- So, Raymond...

13:59.129 --> 14:00.707
the guy Darius was arrested with,

14:00.731 --> 14:02.776
the guy who was supplying
him the merchandise...

14:02.800 --> 14:04.544
he was never arraigned.

14:04.568 --> 14:06.212
Well, how is that possible?

14:06.621 --> 14:07.981
He's an FBI agent.

14:08.581 --> 14:09.983
MARISSA: <i>Wait, so what are you saying...</i>

14:10.007 --> 14:12.218
that he put that young man up to it?

14:12.752 --> 14:14.220
BULL: Well, that explains those

14:14.244 --> 14:16.289
earlier evidence tags
you found in the merchandise.

14:16.313 --> 14:18.792
He obviously gets his goods
out of the evidence locker.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.608
Thank you, Raymond.

14:20.632 --> 14:22.529
Finally. I've got a defense.

14:22.804 --> 14:23.963
Entrapment.

14:24.555 --> 14:27.434
Ha! I may actually graduate with honors.

14:27.975 --> 14:29.789
Look, according to Darius,

14:29.813 --> 14:31.538
this Raymond was all over him

14:31.562 --> 14:33.907
trying to get him to sell
his merchandise.

14:33.931 --> 14:35.842
Now, think about it... without Raymond,

14:35.866 --> 14:38.711
Darius never would have
committed this crime.

14:39.070 --> 14:41.082
I can't wait to cross-examine this dude.

14:41.106 --> 14:42.850
BENNY: Hold on a second, Chunk.

14:42.874 --> 14:45.586
You don't want to go
barking up that tree.

14:45.610 --> 14:47.855
This FBI guy didn't turn
Darius into a criminal.

14:47.879 --> 14:50.024
Didn't you tell me
he already had a record?

14:50.048 --> 14:51.350
Oh, please. He was

14:51.374 --> 14:53.317
16 years old,
and it was his sister's car.

14:53.341 --> 14:54.904
Yes, but the prosecutor

14:54.928 --> 14:57.165
is gonna use it to demonstrate he had

14:57.189 --> 14:59.200
- a criminal past.
- TAYLOR: I thought you weren't allowed

14:59.224 --> 15:00.811
to bring up a person's past.

15:00.812 --> 15:03.290
They can if you
accuse them of entrapment.

15:03.678 --> 15:05.826
I promise you they will read into record

15:05.850 --> 15:08.429
every bad thing he's ever done.

15:08.766 --> 15:10.664
If he stole a candy bar when he was ten,

15:10.688 --> 15:12.266
they'll tell the jury about it.

15:12.290 --> 15:15.936
Plus, if you go with entrapment,
you'll have to admit that Darius

15:15.960 --> 15:18.506
was actually selling
the counterfeit goods.

15:18.943 --> 15:21.342
There'll be no wiggle room
to argue his innocence.

15:21.366 --> 15:23.010
It's too risky. Tell him.

15:23.034 --> 15:24.578
You just told him.

15:25.074 --> 15:26.614
You get it, don't you?

15:26.638 --> 15:28.115
It's 3-D chess.

15:28.139 --> 15:30.501
Whatever you do, we inherit.

15:30.525 --> 15:32.609
So you have to be really careful.

15:33.678 --> 15:34.989
I get it.

15:35.013 --> 15:36.257
I do.

15:36.281 --> 15:37.858
And understand, if you do anything

15:37.882 --> 15:40.060
to jeopardize Willie's case...
our client's case...

15:40.084 --> 15:43.631
we will be duty bound to protect
Willie and his business,

15:43.655 --> 15:46.345
even if it means rolling over
you and your client.

15:47.430 --> 15:48.859
I get that, too.

15:50.228 --> 15:51.438
Wai...

15:51.462 --> 15:53.207
(SCOFFS QUIETLY)

15:53.231 --> 15:54.942
W-Wait a second. Wait a second.

15:54.966 --> 15:56.010
Bull, wait a second.

15:57.338 --> 15:59.066
I... Okay, fine.

16:00.305 --> 16:01.582
No entrapment.

16:02.361 --> 16:04.341
See you in court, Counselor.

16:09.969 --> 16:13.782
My client is a 20-year-old man
doing all he can

16:13.806 --> 16:16.051
to make enough money to keep himself

16:16.075 --> 16:17.953
and his family afloat.

16:17.977 --> 16:21.264
All of us remember 20, right? Big year.

16:21.288 --> 16:23.341
Big year for my client.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.961
He opened his first checking account.

16:25.985 --> 16:29.798
Rented his first apartment,
got his first credit card,

16:29.822 --> 16:31.766
his first cell phone account.

16:32.258 --> 16:33.802
Lots of important firsts.

16:34.352 --> 16:36.705
Now, the government will tell you

16:36.729 --> 16:39.641
that this same young man
who lives in a single room

16:39.665 --> 16:42.744
with a hot plate
and a bathtub in his kitchen

16:42.768 --> 16:45.981
is actually threatening the copyrights

16:46.005 --> 16:49.384
of some famous designers
and huge apparel companies.

16:49.408 --> 16:52.888
How? By selling cheap copies

16:52.912 --> 16:55.724
out of the back of his
grandfather's barber shop.

16:56.207 --> 16:57.426
You know the ones I mean.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.561
You see them on the street corners,

16:59.585 --> 17:01.396
where thousands of people walk by

17:01.420 --> 17:04.632
and hundreds of people
stop to buy things.

17:05.089 --> 17:07.602
But those vendors

17:07.626 --> 17:09.387
aren't here in court.

17:11.464 --> 17:14.041
My 20-year-old client, who's done maybe

17:14.066 --> 17:16.912
$1,000 worth of sales
in the past month...

17:17.310 --> 17:18.646
he's here.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.450
It's a bit of a head-scratcher, isn't it?

17:21.473 --> 17:23.084
MARISSA (OVER EARBUD):
Oh, these jurors are

17:23.108 --> 17:25.520
lovin' them some Chunk.
It's like he's been

17:25.544 --> 17:27.255
doing it all his life.

17:27.279 --> 17:29.291
- Shh. I don't want to miss anything.
- CHUNK: But it gets crazier.

17:29.315 --> 17:32.160
What if I told you that the
merchandise that he was selling

17:32.576 --> 17:35.997
came from the same people
who arrested him?

17:36.021 --> 17:39.768
That's right... they supplied the goods.

17:39.792 --> 17:41.703
And not only that. When he told them,

17:41.727 --> 17:42.971
"No, I don't want to sell

17:42.995 --> 17:45.507
"your cheap copies of expensive purses

17:45.531 --> 17:47.576
and watches and sneakers,"

17:47.600 --> 17:50.812
they kept coming back and badgering him.

17:50.836 --> 17:52.013
Oh, gee.

17:52.037 --> 17:53.248
It looks like he's doing the very thing

17:53.272 --> 17:54.883
Benny and Bull asked him not to do.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.551
- Yeah.
- CHUNK: There's a name for that, folks.

17:56.575 --> 17:58.453
But didn't you say
the jury was loving it?

17:58.894 --> 18:00.989
It's called entrapment.

18:01.939 --> 18:03.024
And if you look the word up

18:03.048 --> 18:05.360
in the dictionary, it literally means

18:05.384 --> 18:07.195
tricking someone into

18:07.219 --> 18:09.664
committing a crime. (SCOFFS)

18:09.688 --> 18:11.900
Is that what our government
should be doing...

18:11.924 --> 18:15.804
tricking its citizens
into breaking the law?

18:15.828 --> 18:17.806
I don't think so.

18:17.830 --> 18:20.308
And I'm reasonably sure
that once you have heard

18:20.332 --> 18:21.710
all of the evidence,

18:21.734 --> 18:23.334
you won't think so either.

18:27.465 --> 18:29.407
What the hell's the matter with you?

18:30.543 --> 18:32.587
It's nice to see you, too.

18:33.471 --> 18:35.757
I warned you against entrapment.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.993
You just couldn't resist, could you?

18:38.017 --> 18:41.296
Look, that FBI guy...

18:41.320 --> 18:43.765
he approached Darius five separate times.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.233
That's textbook entrapment.

18:45.257 --> 18:46.601
How am I supposed to ignore that?

18:46.625 --> 18:48.770
You just do it!

18:49.153 --> 18:51.840
You listen to the people
who know more than you,

18:51.864 --> 18:54.042
who are trying to help you.

18:54.066 --> 18:56.211
Hell, nobody's talking about textbooks.

18:56.235 --> 18:58.469
This is a courtroom, not a classroom.

19:00.439 --> 19:02.284
(EXHALES)

19:03.000 --> 19:04.376
Don't you see, Chunk...

19:06.145 --> 19:08.189
Y-You told the jury

19:08.213 --> 19:10.466
that your client did it.

19:11.517 --> 19:13.828
And that means that your whole defense

19:13.852 --> 19:16.972
is now gonna be based on why he did it.

19:17.389 --> 19:18.967
And that's a tough fight.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.869
Even for a guy who knows what he's doing.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.904
Well, thanks for the vote of confidence.

19:22.928 --> 19:25.707
Not that you care, but I'm more than able

19:25.731 --> 19:27.691
and willing to fight that fight.

19:29.151 --> 19:30.445
Oh.

19:30.469 --> 19:33.155
Well, that just makes it
ten times harder for me.

19:34.073 --> 19:36.484
Because now I have to convince a jury

19:36.508 --> 19:39.154
that Willie knew nothing about it.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.656
And that would have been
a hell of a lot easier

19:41.680 --> 19:43.658
if I could have argued
that we weren't sure

19:43.682 --> 19:45.527
that was even a crime.

19:45.551 --> 19:47.729
But you blew that
to smithereens, hotshot.

19:47.753 --> 19:50.605
And now you're gonna lose your
case and I'm gonna lose mine.

19:50.629 --> 19:54.269
CHUNK: Speak for yourself, Counselor.
- You know what your problem is?

19:54.293 --> 19:56.304
You are arrogant and ignorant,

19:56.328 --> 19:58.239
and that is a deadly
combination, my friend.

19:58.263 --> 20:00.108
I'm not arrogant. I'm confident.

20:00.132 --> 20:01.476
Because I am in the right.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.478
And that's always the best defense.

20:03.502 --> 20:05.604
That's that I'm talking about.

20:06.171 --> 20:08.316
This isn't Sunday school.

20:08.340 --> 20:10.452
Being in the right doesn't mean squat.

20:10.476 --> 20:12.854
Getting a jury to <i>see</i>
that you're in the right...

20:12.878 --> 20:14.255
that's the game we're playing.

20:14.279 --> 20:15.924
And that you don't understand that

20:15.948 --> 20:17.826
proves to me you're not ready
to play with the adults.

20:17.850 --> 20:18.927
Okay...

20:18.951 --> 20:20.752
(LOUD WHISTLE)

20:24.416 --> 20:26.183
Do I need to call both your parents?

20:28.027 --> 20:30.238
- (SIGHS)
- Tomorrow's witness list.

20:30.262 --> 20:32.707
AUSA is calling your favorite
FBI agent, Raymond,

20:32.731 --> 20:33.842
to the stand.

20:34.466 --> 20:36.611
So, now that you've committed to this

20:36.635 --> 20:38.813
unfortunate choice of defense,
I need you to go all-in.

20:38.837 --> 20:41.416
I need you to hammer this
son of a bitch like a bent nail.

20:41.440 --> 20:43.808
Entrapment, entrapment, entrapment.

20:45.544 --> 20:46.988
Makes sense.

20:47.012 --> 20:49.157
And wouldn't you know it,
after a short break for lunch,

20:49.181 --> 20:51.559
our pal Raymond will also
be appearing in your courtroom.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.995
And I need you to pound him, too.

20:54.019 --> 20:56.031
You ever met Willie?
You ever talk to Willie?

20:56.055 --> 20:58.667
You ever even laid eyes on Willie?

20:58.691 --> 21:02.037
I need to convince that jury
that no matter what happened

21:02.061 --> 21:04.139
in that shop after hours,

21:04.163 --> 21:05.730
Willie knew nothing about it.

21:07.866 --> 21:09.344
Got it.

21:09.368 --> 21:11.713
Now shake hands, share your toys

21:11.737 --> 21:13.715
and stop yelling.

21:14.381 --> 21:15.984
Or there'll be no TV for a week.

21:16.425 --> 21:18.676
Or don't. I don't care.

21:23.455 --> 21:27.094
You approached my client on five
separate occasions, didn't you?

21:27.119 --> 21:28.863
You pounded him

21:28.887 --> 21:31.533
until he finally agreed
to cooperate with you.

21:32.099 --> 21:33.977
Nobody pounded anybody.

21:34.001 --> 21:35.278
We chatted.

21:35.302 --> 21:37.580
No one forced him to do anything.

21:37.604 --> 21:38.848
I don't know.

21:38.872 --> 21:40.183
You're a pretty intimidating guy.

21:40.207 --> 21:42.185
Objection. Counsel is testifying,

21:42.209 --> 21:43.920
badgering the witness.

21:43.944 --> 21:46.022
Sustained. Ask a question,

21:46.046 --> 21:47.824
Mr. Palmer.

21:47.848 --> 21:50.426
You approached my client
at the bus stop, didn't you?

21:50.450 --> 21:51.461
I did.

21:51.485 --> 21:52.862
You approached my client at the bodega

21:52.886 --> 21:54.297
when he was buying food, didn't you?

21:54.321 --> 21:55.765
None of that is against the law.

21:55.789 --> 21:57.901
Answer the question. Yes or no?

21:58.926 --> 22:00.370
Yes.

22:00.394 --> 22:01.871
You approached my client while waiting

22:01.895 --> 22:04.007
in line at the movies, didn't you?

22:04.031 --> 22:05.475
A happy coincidence.

22:05.499 --> 22:06.949
I was going to the movies, too.

22:06.973 --> 22:09.279
You were relentless, weren't you?

22:09.303 --> 22:10.880
I take my job seriously.

22:10.904 --> 22:12.048
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

22:12.072 --> 22:13.549
You a part of a team,

22:13.573 --> 22:14.717
Agent Hill?

22:14.741 --> 22:15.776
Yes.

22:16.276 --> 22:19.289
And your team profits
from forfeiture proceedings.

22:19.313 --> 22:20.623
(CHUCKLES) Everyone profits

22:20.647 --> 22:22.058
when you take criminals off the street.

22:22.082 --> 22:23.860
Except my client wasn't a criminal

22:23.884 --> 22:25.712
until you came into his life.

22:25.736 --> 22:27.730
Objection. Again, argumentative.

22:27.754 --> 22:30.099
Sustained. Watch it,

22:30.123 --> 22:31.901
- Mr. Palmer.
- RAYMOND: Your client

22:31.925 --> 22:33.469
sold counterfeit goods. Your client

22:33.493 --> 22:34.837
stole a car.

22:34.861 --> 22:36.906
He didn't need my help
to become a criminal.

22:36.930 --> 22:39.809
The counterfeit goods that my
client is accused of selling...

22:39.833 --> 22:42.178
you supplied him those goods, didn't you?

22:42.202 --> 22:43.746
- Objection.
- Overruled.

22:43.770 --> 22:45.180
Answer the question.

22:45.706 --> 22:47.350
Yes, I supplied the merchandise.

22:47.374 --> 22:49.275
- Brought in customers?
- Some.

22:51.011 --> 22:52.789
That's a pretty great system.

22:53.731 --> 22:55.758
You dream up a crime,

22:55.782 --> 22:58.000
bully someone into committing it,

22:58.024 --> 23:00.129
and then you bust them for it.

23:00.153 --> 23:02.031
All the while, you and the members

23:02.055 --> 23:04.167
of your team are commended for it.

23:04.191 --> 23:05.691
Isn't that how it works?

23:07.467 --> 23:09.734
You got promotions and raises,

23:09.759 --> 23:11.404
didn't you?

23:13.980 --> 23:15.681
The witness will answer the question.

23:18.213 --> 23:19.749
Yes.

23:19.773 --> 23:22.475
- (GALLERY MURMURING)
- We got promotions and raises.

23:24.044 --> 23:25.822
No further questions.

23:26.138 --> 23:27.623
BENNY: <i>Isn't it true</i>

23:27.647 --> 23:30.193
that you communicated exclusively

23:30.217 --> 23:33.162
with my client's grandson,
Darius Lambert?

23:33.186 --> 23:34.630
True.

23:34.654 --> 23:36.399
BENNY: In fact,

23:36.423 --> 23:40.126
you've never even spoken to
Mr. Willie Lambert, have you?

23:43.597 --> 23:45.408
No, I have not.

23:45.432 --> 23:48.745
And when you did find occasion
to go to the barbershop,

23:48.769 --> 23:51.347
it was always
after closing time, wasn't it?

23:51.830 --> 23:52.987
I believe so.

23:53.011 --> 23:54.374
In truth,

23:54.608 --> 23:56.519
you actually went out of your way

23:56.543 --> 23:59.155
to avoid my client, didn't you?

23:59.179 --> 24:00.823
Where is this going?

24:00.847 --> 24:02.357
Get to it, Mr. Colón.

24:02.381 --> 24:05.795
You figured if Willie knew
what was going on in his shop,

24:05.819 --> 24:08.131
he'd put a stop to it immediately,

24:08.155 --> 24:10.033
and that isn't what you wanted.

24:10.057 --> 24:11.334
Objection.

24:11.358 --> 24:12.870
'Cause if he put a stop to it,

24:12.894 --> 24:15.071
you and your colleagues
wouldn't have anything

24:15.095 --> 24:16.813
to show for all of your hard work.

24:17.731 --> 24:19.191
I'm sorry, um...

24:20.000 --> 24:21.434
what was the question?

24:23.170 --> 24:25.281
Actually, I don't think
there is a question.

24:26.381 --> 24:28.384
I think it's all perfectly clear.

24:28.867 --> 24:31.110
No more questions for
this witness, Your Honor.

24:34.164 --> 24:35.629
BULL: Ah.

24:35.653 --> 24:37.448
There's a familiar face.

24:37.472 --> 24:39.662
Dr. Bull. It's been a while.

24:39.686 --> 24:41.898
What can I do for you?

24:41.922 --> 24:44.700
Well, Chunk Palmer,

24:45.217 --> 24:46.769
the opposing counsel...

24:46.793 --> 24:50.606
when he's not going to
school, he's working for me.

24:50.630 --> 24:52.275
- Aha.
- Mm.

24:52.299 --> 24:53.709
You want me to go easy on him?

24:53.733 --> 24:55.945
I was kind of hoping we could
go easy on each other.

24:55.969 --> 24:57.146
How do you mean?

24:57.170 --> 25:00.416
I was hoping we could bring this case

25:00.440 --> 25:02.624
to a mutually beneficial resolution.

25:02.648 --> 25:04.554
I am never averse to a plea.

25:05.237 --> 25:06.756
What are you proposing?

25:06.780 --> 25:08.791
How do you feel about six months?

25:08.815 --> 25:10.326
If you can get him to plead guilty,

25:10.350 --> 25:11.928
I'll recommend 36 months.

25:11.952 --> 25:14.230
Come on. He's a kid.

25:14.254 --> 25:16.188
He doesn't deserve that much time.

25:17.257 --> 25:18.691
Let's make it a year.

25:20.210 --> 25:22.238
I may be able to sell that.

25:22.262 --> 25:23.773
And no admission of guilt.

25:23.797 --> 25:25.595
No. I can't sentence him
without a guilty plea.

25:25.620 --> 25:26.676
Sure you can.

25:26.700 --> 25:29.011
We could do an Alford plea.

25:29.035 --> 25:31.581
<i>An Alford plea means Darius doesn't</i>

25:31.605 --> 25:32.849
actually admit he's guilty.

25:32.873 --> 25:34.584
The only thing he admits is

25:34.608 --> 25:36.085
that the government has enough evidence

25:36.109 --> 25:38.354
to prove he did what he's accused of.

25:38.378 --> 25:40.423
So he says he isn't guilty...

25:40.897 --> 25:43.292
and gets sentenced anyway. (SCOFFS)

25:43.316 --> 25:44.927
What's he get?

25:44.951 --> 25:46.496
In this case, it's a year

25:46.520 --> 25:48.287
instead of the ten he was staring at.

25:49.956 --> 25:52.034
(SIGHS) Chunk, it's a win-win.

25:52.058 --> 25:54.003
It's a great deal for Darius,

25:54.027 --> 25:56.539
and there's no admission
of guilt to use against Willie.

25:56.955 --> 25:59.509
An Alford plea. It's the same

25:59.533 --> 26:00.810
as if he plead no contest.

26:00.834 --> 26:02.178
I know what an Alford plea is.

26:02.202 --> 26:04.280
Great. Then tomorrow morning,
I need you to go talk

26:04.304 --> 26:06.465
to your client, and tell him to take it.

26:07.073 --> 26:10.953
Look, I know I'm the reason
you got involved with this case.

26:10.977 --> 26:13.556
And I appreciate everything
that you've done.

26:13.580 --> 26:14.891
Then there's nothing else to talk about.

26:14.915 --> 26:16.359
But an Alford plea... I'm not sure

26:16.383 --> 26:17.960
that's how I want to play it.

26:17.984 --> 26:20.296
I don't think you get
what's happening here.

26:20.320 --> 26:21.631
No, I get it.

26:21.655 --> 26:24.400
It's good for you
and good for your client.

26:24.424 --> 26:25.568
And your client, too.

26:25.592 --> 26:28.204
Unless I win,
which is good for everybody.

26:28.228 --> 26:29.539
But you're not gonna win.

26:29.563 --> 26:31.340
You already admitted he did it.

26:31.364 --> 26:33.776
You didn't leave the jury any
room to find for your client,

26:33.800 --> 26:35.845
which is exactly what we told
you was gonna happen.

26:36.787 --> 26:39.649
Now take your ego out of the equation,

26:39.673 --> 26:41.484
go and talk to your client,

26:41.508 --> 26:43.669
tell him to take the deal.

26:47.180 --> 26:50.459
You just... you got to keep in mind

26:50.483 --> 26:53.011
that you're looking
at ten years in prison.

26:56.356 --> 26:59.335
You're pretty sure they're gonna
find me guilty, huh?

26:59.359 --> 27:01.360
The thing is,
I can't guarantee they won't.

27:02.929 --> 27:04.907
This is good for my grandpa?

27:04.931 --> 27:06.375
Yeah.

27:06.817 --> 27:09.301
You'll absolutely
be helping your grandpa.

27:11.671 --> 27:15.017
And just so you understand,
you'll be sentenced today.

27:15.041 --> 27:16.552
You'll serve a year in prison,

27:16.576 --> 27:18.844
and you'll be a convicted felon
when you get out.

27:22.374 --> 27:24.026
And what would you do?

27:24.050 --> 27:25.695
I mean, if...

27:25.719 --> 27:27.797
if you were me? Would you do it?

27:28.130 --> 27:31.400
Would you serve a year in prison
for selling some stuff

27:31.424 --> 27:33.636
that no one in their right mind
would think

27:33.660 --> 27:36.205
is anything but what it is:

27:36.930 --> 27:38.664
pretend fancy?

27:46.506 --> 27:48.484
The defendant has indicated he would like

27:48.508 --> 27:49.986
to offer a change of plea.

27:50.963 --> 27:53.097
Is that true, Mr. Palmer?

27:58.251 --> 27:59.744
Darius...

28:00.253 --> 28:02.831
I need you to tell me
that this is your choice.

28:04.658 --> 28:06.469
I got to think about my grandfather.

28:06.786 --> 28:08.053
Mr. Palmer?

28:11.931 --> 28:13.476
You know what?

28:13.500 --> 28:17.380
I'm starting to think
that m-maybe we got that wrong.

28:17.404 --> 28:19.882
Maybe you just got to think about you.

28:19.906 --> 28:22.225
Look, don't say that.

28:22.542 --> 28:24.020
- You're confusing me.
- Look,

28:24.044 --> 28:26.022
I think it's great

28:26.046 --> 28:27.957
that you're tying
to protect someone else,

28:28.607 --> 28:31.234
but that man has lived his life.

28:31.751 --> 28:34.196
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) He made his choices.

28:34.696 --> 28:36.699
And it seems to me that most of those

28:36.723 --> 28:39.168
have been about making sure
that you had a better life

28:39.192 --> 28:42.405
than he had, I don't think he'd
want you to give up on that.

28:42.429 --> 28:44.106
And besides...

28:44.130 --> 28:46.742
he is surrounded by great people...

28:46.766 --> 28:48.611
terrific legal minds.

28:48.635 --> 28:50.378
He will have his day in court.

28:51.546 --> 28:53.238
But today is yours.

28:54.188 --> 28:55.258
So...

28:56.056 --> 28:58.136
do you want to take this deal

28:59.045 --> 29:00.623
or do we fight on?

29:00.647 --> 29:01.957
Mr. Palmer...

29:02.349 --> 29:04.226
what's your pleasure?

29:07.420 --> 29:09.899
Mr. Palmer, do we swear in your client

29:09.923 --> 29:12.335
and commence with the allocution?

29:12.734 --> 29:15.304
I apologize, Your Honor,

29:15.328 --> 29:17.273
but after careful consideration,

29:17.297 --> 29:21.010
my client has decided he does
not wish to change his plea.

29:21.618 --> 29:24.002
He wishes to continue with the trial.

29:44.153 --> 29:45.698
He in there?

29:45.722 --> 29:47.561
He sure is.

29:50.814 --> 29:52.290
You got a minute?

29:52.315 --> 29:53.849
Come on in.

30:01.437 --> 30:02.993
I know you're angry.

30:03.699 --> 30:05.209
You don't know anything.

30:05.234 --> 30:07.664
That's the part I can't seem
to get you to understand.

30:08.912 --> 30:11.418
Uh, look, I-I didn't take the plea be...

30:12.034 --> 30:13.837
<i>he</i> didn't take the plea be...

30:14.424 --> 30:17.036
because damn it, a year in prison

30:17.687 --> 30:19.784
is a year too long for something that

30:19.808 --> 30:21.657
he never would have done
had law enforcement

30:21.681 --> 30:22.971
not trapped him into it.

30:23.641 --> 30:26.119
And yeah, I understand
the 3-D chess of it all,

30:26.143 --> 30:28.121
but we got to...

30:28.145 --> 30:31.258
I... I got to take things as they come.

30:31.282 --> 30:33.398
And Darius comes first.

30:34.151 --> 30:36.129
I know that was your thinking,

30:36.153 --> 30:38.598
I respect that that was your thinking,

30:39.112 --> 30:42.135
I just don't agree with your thinking.

30:42.159 --> 30:43.637
And here we are.

30:43.661 --> 30:44.909
Here we are.

30:45.830 --> 30:47.579
And just so you know,

30:48.332 --> 30:50.677
I've subpoenaed Willie to testify.

30:50.701 --> 30:52.266
In Darius's case.

30:52.290 --> 30:54.448
(CHUCKLES): Seriously?

30:54.472 --> 30:57.368
Willie is my client,
and he is not gonna testify.

30:57.369 --> 30:58.980
He's my first witness tomorrow morning.

30:59.004 --> 31:00.830
No, he's not. I won't allow it.

31:00.854 --> 31:02.283
That would not be in his best interest.

31:02.307 --> 31:04.819
It's too late. He's already agreed to it.

31:04.843 --> 31:06.821
You understand if he takes
the stand for Darius,

31:06.845 --> 31:08.656
if he inadvertently admits to something

31:08.680 --> 31:10.191
that hurts his own case...

31:10.215 --> 31:11.692
I understand,

31:12.187 --> 31:14.528
he understands, and we all think

31:14.552 --> 31:16.520
it's a risk worth taking.

31:18.823 --> 31:21.168
You talked to him without my permission.

31:21.192 --> 31:22.503
I did.

31:23.073 --> 31:24.772
Well, then, I hope you know
what you're doing.

31:24.796 --> 31:27.035
I'm just doing what you always taught me:

31:27.832 --> 31:29.533
believing in myself.

31:31.622 --> 31:33.389
I'll see you in court.

31:36.544 --> 31:39.287
Mr. Lambert, how did you
feel when your grandson

31:39.311 --> 31:42.046
stole your granddaughter's brand-new car?

31:44.215 --> 31:46.494
Angry. Mad.

31:46.518 --> 31:48.029
Sad.

31:48.053 --> 31:49.864
Uh, disappointed.

31:49.888 --> 31:53.200
But I knew that wasn't
who he was. (CHUCKLES)

31:53.224 --> 31:56.003
The good Lord wasn't through
cooking him yet.

31:56.027 --> 31:57.437
(CLEARS THROAT)

31:57.461 --> 31:59.640
Boys do all kind of silly, stupid stuff

31:59.664 --> 32:02.143
when they're-when they're 16.

32:02.735 --> 32:04.117
I did a lot of s...

32:04.364 --> 32:06.681
stupid stuff when I was 16.

32:07.242 --> 32:10.071
So I held my tongue,

32:10.095 --> 32:11.886
bided my time.

32:11.910 --> 32:13.387
And were you right?

32:13.411 --> 32:15.423
How did he do with his probation?

32:15.447 --> 32:18.426
Four years. Never slipped up. Not once.

32:18.450 --> 32:21.506
And his probation officer was strict.

32:22.053 --> 32:24.131
He'd give him these random, uh,

32:24.155 --> 32:26.734
uh, drug and alcohol tests.

32:27.137 --> 32:28.992
Put him on curfew.

32:31.329 --> 32:34.275
That guy was serious. Very serious.

32:34.299 --> 32:36.510
And did he ever stop by?

32:36.534 --> 32:38.446
Come by the house or the shop?

32:38.470 --> 32:41.082
Give you an idea
as to how Darius was doing?

32:41.106 --> 32:42.750
Objection. Hearsay.

32:42.774 --> 32:44.775
Objection sustained.

32:46.811 --> 32:48.658
Let's try another way.

32:49.147 --> 32:51.892
You met Darius probation officer?

32:51.916 --> 32:54.795
Sure have. Came by the shop.

32:54.819 --> 32:57.417
Wanted to see where Darius was working.

32:58.156 --> 33:00.234
I told him, "Look around."

33:00.258 --> 33:03.738
Showed him Darius' chair,
his barber's license,

33:03.762 --> 33:06.607
the album with pictures
of haircuts that he likes

33:06.631 --> 33:07.908
and wants to try.

33:07.932 --> 33:10.978
Showed him his equipment...
his-his scissors,

33:11.002 --> 33:12.813
his combs and razors.

33:12.837 --> 33:14.715
Took him to the back room and showed him

33:14.739 --> 33:18.252
where Darius kept his shaving butter.

33:18.276 --> 33:20.354
Opened the closet, showed him the boxes.

33:20.378 --> 33:22.108
Even gave him a sample.

33:22.580 --> 33:23.958
Was he impressed?

33:23.982 --> 33:25.682
Your Honor.

33:26.918 --> 33:28.752
I withdraw the question.

33:30.789 --> 33:33.434
Do you regret hiring your grandson?

33:33.458 --> 33:35.035
He seems to have gotten himself

33:35.059 --> 33:36.604
into quite a bit of trouble here.

33:36.628 --> 33:39.306
I don't regret it for a second.

33:39.330 --> 33:40.941
I honestly don't feel that he did

33:40.965 --> 33:42.796
get himself into trouble.

33:43.535 --> 33:45.045
I feel like...

33:45.069 --> 33:47.948
he was led into trouble.

33:48.760 --> 33:51.152
Here's something that, uh,

33:51.721 --> 33:53.487
maybe you don't know.

33:54.724 --> 33:56.457
He did it for me.

33:57.060 --> 33:58.526
He knew I was

33:58.550 --> 34:00.396
barely hanging on.

34:01.219 --> 34:04.165
Utilities, taxes.

34:04.189 --> 34:06.567
Every few days, he'd come up
and say, "Grandpa,

34:06.591 --> 34:09.656
I sold another case
of my shaving butter."

34:10.395 --> 34:14.275
Give me $100. $200!

34:14.299 --> 34:17.945
I said, "Damn,
that shaving butter's flying

34:17.969 --> 34:19.480
out that back room." (CHUCKLES)

34:19.998 --> 34:21.835
I also thought

34:22.574 --> 34:24.295
that grandson of mine...

34:27.404 --> 34:29.801
God's done cooking.

34:30.949 --> 34:32.683
And he's done a damn good job.

34:34.347 --> 34:35.529
Hell of a job.

34:36.516 --> 34:38.632
CHUNK: Mr. Lambert, thank you.

34:39.435 --> 34:41.391
I have no further questions.

34:45.150 --> 34:46.429
Mr. Lambert...

34:48.319 --> 34:50.811
...if I told you to steal something...

34:51.406 --> 34:53.581
that woman's purse... would you do it?

34:53.605 --> 34:56.150
Objection. Relevance.

34:56.174 --> 34:58.219
Overruled.

34:58.243 --> 35:00.387
The witness will answer the question.

35:01.249 --> 35:02.923
Of course not.

35:03.459 --> 35:05.148
How about if I asked you twice?

35:07.380 --> 35:09.063
- No.
- Ten times?

35:09.087 --> 35:10.798
You could ask me a million times.

35:10.822 --> 35:12.700
I wouldn't steal someone's stuff.

35:12.724 --> 35:13.761
Good for you.

35:14.929 --> 35:17.361
And what do you call someone who does?

35:19.063 --> 35:20.407
Someone like your grandson.

35:20.431 --> 35:22.076
CHUNK: Your Honor, objection!

35:22.100 --> 35:23.544
She's badgering the witness.

35:23.568 --> 35:26.136
Never mind. I withdraw the question.

35:27.805 --> 35:29.473
I have nothing further.

35:33.144 --> 35:34.824
BULL: Counselor.

35:41.456 --> 35:44.231
Tell me again how you're
just doing what I taught you.

35:44.255 --> 35:45.933
Willie did you proud.

35:45.957 --> 35:49.737
Nah. You were right.

35:49.761 --> 35:51.716
It's not gonna be enough.

35:52.230 --> 35:53.541
I took an unnecessary risk.

35:54.443 --> 35:57.077
Yeah, but at the end of the day,

35:57.101 --> 35:59.680
I don't think he did
any damage to our case.

35:59.704 --> 36:02.716
And, who knows, he may have helped yours.

36:02.740 --> 36:04.118
The jury loved him.

36:04.938 --> 36:06.420
Don't quote me, but I'm starting to think

36:06.444 --> 36:08.822
you may win this thing

36:08.846 --> 36:10.457
with the right closing argument.

36:11.069 --> 36:13.294
BENNY: Plus, you gave him an idea.

36:13.318 --> 36:15.829
He wants to subpoena
Darius' probation officer

36:15.853 --> 36:16.897
to testify.

36:17.492 --> 36:19.133
Really?

36:19.157 --> 36:20.634
How's he gonna help?

36:20.658 --> 36:24.207
Well, he's not talking about your case.

36:24.629 --> 36:26.674
He's talking about our case.

36:26.698 --> 36:28.509
Watch and learn.

36:29.212 --> 36:31.845
Good morning, Mr. Chilton. Now,

36:31.869 --> 36:35.416
I understand that
you are Darius Lambert...

36:35.440 --> 36:37.785
Willie Lambert's grandson's
probation officer.

36:37.809 --> 36:40.120
Are you aware that he started a business

36:40.144 --> 36:42.256
making homemade shaving butter?

36:42.280 --> 36:45.192
Objection. What does this have
to do with Mr. Willie Lambert?

36:45.216 --> 36:47.361
What's the relevance, Mr. Colón?

36:47.385 --> 36:49.565
I'll rephrase, Your Honor.

36:50.154 --> 36:52.433
Did my client ever have occasion

36:52.457 --> 36:54.335
to show you around his barber shop?

36:54.359 --> 36:56.114
Yes, he did.

36:56.461 --> 36:58.405
I stopped in to see where Darius worked,

36:58.429 --> 37:00.945
and he gave me a little
tour of the place.

37:00.970 --> 37:04.178
Did he happen to lead you
over to where his grandson

37:04.202 --> 37:05.446
kept his shaving butter?

37:05.470 --> 37:07.615
- He did.
- And where was that?

37:07.639 --> 37:09.617
I believe it was in the back closet.

37:09.641 --> 37:11.852
- And he left you all alone back there?
- Yes.

37:11.876 --> 37:13.654
Told you to open up any box you wanted?

37:13.678 --> 37:15.189
I didn't open any boxes.

37:15.213 --> 37:18.392
But you could have. You wanted to.

37:18.416 --> 37:20.294
I mean, he invited you to.

37:20.318 --> 37:21.723
Yeah.

37:22.620 --> 37:24.221
As a matter of fact, he did.

37:25.810 --> 37:27.645
Now, take a look at this photo.

37:28.960 --> 37:32.039
It's a police photo
from the night of the seizure.

37:32.063 --> 37:34.375
Is that the closet you're talking about?

37:34.399 --> 37:36.341
- Appears to be.
- Huh.

37:36.365 --> 37:38.614
It's where Darius
kept his shaving butter.

37:39.170 --> 37:41.582
But did you know it's also where

37:41.606 --> 37:44.718
Darius stashed
his counterfeit merchandise,

37:44.742 --> 37:46.920
to be sold at the behest of Agent Hill?

37:46.944 --> 37:48.922
Again, this jury is not here

37:48.946 --> 37:51.558
to decide the Darius Lambert case.

37:51.582 --> 37:54.528
Mr. Colón, can you
connect the dots for me?

37:54.552 --> 37:56.563
Of course, Your Honor.

37:57.133 --> 37:59.072
We are alleging that

37:59.444 --> 38:01.235
Mr. Lambert didn't know

38:01.259 --> 38:04.605
that counterfeit merchandise
was being sold from his shop.

38:05.141 --> 38:08.776
But I submit that
this is definitive proof.

38:08.800 --> 38:11.278
Because if Mr. Lambert would have known

38:11.302 --> 38:13.280
that there was contraband back there,

38:13.304 --> 38:15.115
he never would have offered

38:15.139 --> 38:18.052
his grandson's probation officer to have

38:18.076 --> 38:20.177
unfettered access in that area.

38:21.540 --> 38:23.524
Marissa, tell me what you see.

38:23.548 --> 38:26.026
Green. Nothing but green.

38:26.050 --> 38:27.718
Green as a gooseberry.

38:36.194 --> 38:38.906
(SIGHS)

38:38.930 --> 38:40.741
Chunk still at it?

38:40.765 --> 38:42.910
Still working on his closing argument?

38:42.934 --> 38:44.555
Yep.

38:46.182 --> 38:47.781
No sound?

38:47.805 --> 38:50.284
You don't want to hear what he's saying?

38:50.308 --> 38:52.401
I want to be surprised tomorrow in court.

38:52.426 --> 38:53.654
Hmm.

38:54.190 --> 38:57.024
I was so angry at him yesterday.

38:57.048 --> 38:59.153
The way he defied me.

38:59.851 --> 39:02.463
How dare he believe in himself
more than he believes in me?

39:02.487 --> 39:04.200
- Kids today.
- Hmm.

39:07.161 --> 39:08.830
CHUNK: My client did it.

39:10.206 --> 39:11.438
We've...

39:11.462 --> 39:13.084
never denied that.

39:14.168 --> 39:17.044
What we have tried to impress upon you

39:17.839 --> 39:20.280
is that this crime never had to happen.

39:21.134 --> 39:23.016
If Agent Hill had never pleaded

39:23.040 --> 39:26.153
with my client
to sell his counterfeit goods,

39:26.639 --> 39:28.599
none of us would be sitting here.

39:29.559 --> 39:32.192
My client wasn't looking
for something to sell

39:32.216 --> 39:33.927
out of his grandfather's shop.

39:33.951 --> 39:36.620
He just wanted to cut hair
and sell his shaving butter.

39:38.568 --> 39:40.027
But here we are.

39:41.362 --> 39:43.203
And here you are.

39:43.781 --> 39:46.240
And if you think that
selling cheap copies

39:46.264 --> 39:50.177
of expensive purses
and wallets and sneakers

39:50.201 --> 39:53.947
is worth ten years behind bars...

39:53.971 --> 39:56.717
worth taking away somebody's 20s...

39:56.741 --> 39:58.223
will make your neighborhood,

39:58.247 --> 40:00.354
your city, your world

40:00.378 --> 40:02.341
a safer place...

40:03.648 --> 40:05.582
then I encourage you to find him guilty.

40:08.019 --> 40:09.640
But if you're like me,

40:10.766 --> 40:13.300
and you think that your block,

40:13.324 --> 40:15.869
your city, your world
would be better served

40:15.893 --> 40:17.871
by having a young man

40:17.895 --> 40:20.568
who cares so deeply for his family...

40:21.666 --> 40:23.279
...for his grandfather,

40:24.405 --> 40:26.713
that he's willing to put in

40:26.737 --> 40:28.916
the extra work, and try to add money

40:28.940 --> 40:30.995
to his family's business,

40:32.043 --> 40:34.054
then I urge you to remember

40:34.078 --> 40:36.112
what I said a moment ago.

40:37.815 --> 40:40.650
This crime never had to happen.

40:41.919 --> 40:44.665
This prison sentence never has to happen.

40:44.689 --> 40:46.967
This miscarriage of justice,

40:46.991 --> 40:49.703
this destruction of a young man's life

40:49.727 --> 40:52.058
never has to happen.

40:54.265 --> 40:57.021
And I would implore you...

40:57.602 --> 41:00.370
to find my client innocent.

41:02.907 --> 41:04.641
Thank you for your time.

41:18.756 --> 41:20.690
♪

41:22.026 --> 41:23.237
WILLIE: Great job.

41:23.261 --> 41:25.428
Thank you. Congratulations.

41:28.232 --> 41:29.699
Ah.

41:31.736 --> 41:33.247
Come here, now.

41:33.271 --> 41:35.739
Come here, son. Come here, son.

41:37.475 --> 41:40.320
Come on, girl. Come on, now.

41:40.344 --> 41:41.655
(CHUCKLES)

41:41.679 --> 41:43.526
Nice work, Counselor.

41:44.115 --> 41:46.059
Thank you for your help.

41:46.083 --> 41:47.427
Thanks for getting involved.

41:47.451 --> 41:50.116
No, thank you for pushing back.

41:52.390 --> 41:54.401
Thank you for letting me.

41:54.425 --> 41:55.736
WILLIE: Uh...

41:55.760 --> 41:57.504
why don't we all get something to eat.

41:57.528 --> 41:58.772
You must be hungry.

41:58.796 --> 42:00.240
- Yeah!
- WILLIE: Yeah?

42:00.264 --> 42:01.909
Yeah? Let's go. Come on.

42:01.933 --> 42:03.533
Oh. Thank you, again.
