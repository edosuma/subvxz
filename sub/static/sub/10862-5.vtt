14:45.480 --> 14:46.200
[Ring]

14:53.440 --> 14:54.680
[Bell rings]

14:54.680 --> 14:55.680
Ahh.

14:55.680 --> 14:56.880
OK, kiddies.

14:56.880 --> 14:58.880
Turn them in.

15:01.440 --> 15:02.880
Now?

15:02.880 --> 15:04.440
Let's go.

15:12.480 --> 15:14.400
This is it.

15:14.400 --> 15:16.920
And, uh...

15:16.920 --> 15:18.880
<i> This is it.</i>

15:21.920 --> 15:23.960
Lemme read
this masterpiece.

15:26.720 --> 15:28.400
Ahem.

15:31.440 --> 15:35.000
<i> "The Halloween Dance,
by Sean Hackett."</i>

15:37.920 --> 15:39.840
"It was the night
of the school dance,

15:39.840 --> 15:42.880
a night when anything can
happen... and it did."

15:42.880 --> 15:44.240
Whew. Ha.

15:56.760 --> 15:57.880
Sean?

15:58.920 --> 15:59.920
Sean!

16:08.440 --> 16:10.400
What is your
name, Princess?

16:10.400 --> 16:12.640
What's going on?
This is my dream!

16:12.640 --> 16:14.920
I know! It's the
story I wrote, but--

16:14.920 --> 16:16.400
But this is real!

16:16.400 --> 16:17.880
It's really happening!

16:23.400 --> 16:25.320
"We danced for hours.

16:25.320 --> 16:27.360
"Nothing could ruin
the night.

16:27.360 --> 16:30.360
Then slowly we moved
to a dark corner of the room."

16:30.360 --> 16:32.360
Hey! This is pretty good.

16:32.360 --> 16:35.880
Sean, I'm scared.
How is this happening?

16:35.880 --> 16:37.520
It's the story.

16:37.520 --> 16:41.280
Billy's reading it, and it's
coming true just the way I wrote it!

16:41.280 --> 16:43.880
Wait. If this is all
coming true, that means--

16:44.880 --> 16:46.680
Aah!

16:46.680 --> 16:48.680
"The vampire
opened his mouth,

16:48.680 --> 16:50.360
bearing his
razor-sharp fangs."

16:50.360 --> 16:51.880
Fangs?!

16:51.880 --> 16:54.000
Man, this is
pretty gruesome for--

16:55.840 --> 16:56.920
Hey!

16:58.960 --> 17:00.120
Guys?

17:01.200 --> 17:02.440
Whoa!

17:06.560 --> 17:07.480
Aah!

17:07.480 --> 17:09.119
What was that?
What happened?

17:09.119 --> 17:12.000
That wasn't
a dream, was it?

17:12.000 --> 17:15.119
We were really
there, weren't we?

17:15.119 --> 17:19.400
And I was gonna bite you on
the neck for real, wasn't I?

17:19.400 --> 17:22.839
<i>Guys... what is this?</i>

17:22.839 --> 17:24.319
I think we
just discovered

17:24.319 --> 17:26.599
another feature for our
little dream machine.

17:35.400 --> 17:36.120
Watch.

17:37.720 --> 17:39.840
<i> "The Halloween Dance,
by Sean Hackett."</i>

17:39.840 --> 17:41.080
Yo!

17:41.080 --> 17:42.600
What does it mean?

17:42.600 --> 17:45.520
It means that it isn't
just a dream machine.

17:45.520 --> 17:48.440
If you read a story written on
this thing, it's gonna come true!

17:48.440 --> 17:50.360
So if I didn't
stop reading--

17:50.360 --> 17:53.360
I would have bitten Jennifer
on the neck like the story said.

17:53.360 --> 17:56.400
This is too weird.
We have to tell somebody.

17:56.400 --> 17:57.880
We--we have to--

17:57.880 --> 17:58.880
Uh-oh!

17:58.880 --> 18:00.200
What's the matter?

18:00.200 --> 18:02.520
Guys, this isn't the
only story I wrote!

18:19.080 --> 18:21.880
Wait a minute.
What other story--

18:21.880 --> 18:23.880
Oh, man!

18:23.880 --> 18:25.400
What?

18:25.400 --> 18:27.280
We gotta stop her!

18:32.480 --> 18:34.160
Hello?

18:52.880 --> 18:53.960
Mmm!

18:57.480 --> 18:59.440
So what happens
in the story?

18:59.440 --> 19:00.920
You don't wanna know!

19:00.920 --> 19:02.960
<i>Hey, I don't wanna know.</i>

19:07.000 --> 19:08.920
<i> "Trapped, by Sean Hackett."</i>

19:08.920 --> 19:09.920
Hmm.

19:12.960 --> 19:14.000
Yes!

19:17.840 --> 19:18.800
It's not here!

19:18.800 --> 19:20.040
It's gotta be!

19:20.040 --> 19:21.400
She must have it
with her!

19:21.400 --> 19:23.400
She's still here.
Her car's outside.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.840
Guys, if we don't
find it, I'm--

19:28.040 --> 19:32.680
"Billy snuck into a crumbling
old graveyard on a dare."

19:32.680 --> 19:33.800
Ha.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.440
<i>He would.</i>

19:36.440 --> 19:37.920
Oh, no!

19:42.960 --> 19:43.920
No.

19:43.920 --> 19:44.640
No!

19:45.480 --> 19:46.720
Help!

19:49.960 --> 19:51.880
We gotta find her!

19:51.880 --> 19:53.000
Where would she be?

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
John!

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Jennifer!

19:55.000 --> 19:56.520
This is nuts!

19:56.520 --> 19:58.520
Stop reading!

20:02.720 --> 20:04.440
Oh, great!

20:05.760 --> 20:07.200
Mrs. Dodds?

20:07.200 --> 20:09.280
Mrs. Dodds!

20:12.520 --> 20:14.440
She was here.

20:14.440 --> 20:15.880
Come on!

20:16.920 --> 20:18.920
"Billy tried to escape,

20:18.920 --> 20:21.960
but the strange shadows
surrounded him."

20:27.040 --> 20:29.080
Mrs. Dodds?!

20:31.440 --> 20:32.880
Where is she?

20:32.880 --> 20:34.520
Mrs. Dodds!

20:37.440 --> 20:39.880
"The ghost of Blind Paul

20:39.880 --> 20:43.880
was creeping closer
and closer."

20:43.880 --> 20:45.520
[Giggles]

20:46.880 --> 20:48.920
I'm not going into
that grave.

20:48.920 --> 20:50.920
I'm not going into
that grave!

20:50.920 --> 20:53.360
I'm gonna stay
right here and--

20:53.360 --> 20:54.120
No!

21:00.480 --> 21:02.920
It's too late. We're
not gonna find her.

21:02.920 --> 21:04.400
We can't give up!

21:04.400 --> 21:07.440
When that story ends,
Billy's going to--

21:07.440 --> 21:09.440
The story.

21:09.440 --> 21:11.640
The stories come true!

21:13.920 --> 21:14.920
Aah!

21:17.680 --> 21:19.040
What are you doing?

21:19.040 --> 21:20.360
No!

21:20.360 --> 21:21.880
Help!

21:21.880 --> 21:24.280
Let me out! Stop!

21:29.760 --> 21:33.240
"Bill never found his way
out of the graveyard,

21:33.240 --> 21:36.280
and nobody ever discovered
what happened to him."

21:36.280 --> 21:38.440
Help!

21:38.440 --> 21:40.680
Yes! Yes!

21:40.680 --> 21:42.680
"As far as anyone knew,

21:42.680 --> 21:45.320
it was Blind Paul
resting below."

21:46.480 --> 21:47.240
No!

21:49.520 --> 21:50.480
Read it.

21:50.480 --> 21:51.880
Read it!

21:51.880 --> 21:53.400
"The typewriter
stopped glowing,

21:53.400 --> 21:56.600
and all the stories ever
written on it never came true."

21:58.760 --> 22:00.760
Aah! Aah!

22:01.760 --> 22:03.400
Welcome back, dude!

22:03.400 --> 22:05.000
Yes!

22:05.000 --> 22:06.920
I don't know
what you did,

22:06.920 --> 22:08.400
but you did it!

22:08.400 --> 22:10.400
Sean wrote
his best story yet.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.400
Man, I say
we trash that thing.

22:12.400 --> 22:15.560
I don't think we have to
worry about it anymore.

22:18.480 --> 22:19.520
A-he-he-hem!

22:20.640 --> 22:22.680
Is there something
I can do for you?

22:29.920 --> 22:31.680
No, I think
we're fine.

22:36.960 --> 22:38.000
The end."

22:38.000 --> 22:39.360
That was great!

22:39.360 --> 22:41.400
What happened to the--

22:41.400 --> 22:43.040
Kiki?

22:49.640 --> 22:51.840
What's it say?

22:51.840 --> 22:53.840
"The headless warrior
chased down

22:53.840 --> 22:57.320
"each one of the Midnight
Society one by one,

22:57.320 --> 23:00.120
until they were
too tired to run."

23:01.800 --> 23:03.360
Yeah, right.
