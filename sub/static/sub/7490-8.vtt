00:03.709 --> 00:06.458
Man, I can't handle health class anymore.

00:06.542 --> 00:07.875
Yeah, I took that class.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
When they showed the video
of the whale having a baby,

00:10.083 --> 00:11.750
I almost gave birth to my lunch.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.458
Well, Grace asked me to be
her health class partner.

00:15.542 --> 00:17.792
We had to take care of an egg
and pretend that it was our baby.

00:17.875 --> 00:19.083
How'd that work out for you?

00:19.166 --> 00:20.709
Yo, I couldn't take the pressure.

00:20.792 --> 00:23.166
This morning I snapped, fried
up our baby and ate it.

00:24.834 --> 00:27.709
Big news, everyone. Big news!

00:28.375 --> 00:31.083
Thanks to a winning essay by Kim Crawford,

00:31.750 --> 00:33.500
our school has won a concert

00:33.583 --> 00:35.959
from international mega popstar,

00:36.542 --> 00:37.667
Ricky Weaver!

00:38.834 --> 00:39.750
Carry on.

00:40.792 --> 00:42.375
I can't believe I won!

00:42.750 --> 00:45.333
Well, wait. Kim,
you're into Ricky Weaver?

00:45.583 --> 00:47.000
Uh, no.

00:47.083 --> 00:49.625
- I'm not even sure who Ricky Weaver is.
- Oh.

00:49.834 --> 00:50.959
Really, Kim?

00:51.333 --> 00:53.583
'Cause your locker's a huge fan.

01:04.667 --> 01:05.625

01:06.250 --> 01:09.041
I love him.
I downloaded all of his music.

01:09.208 --> 01:10.709
And now I'm gonna meet him.

01:11.125 --> 01:12.792
Ricky!

01:13.834 --> 01:15.583
I'm beginning to think
she knows who Ricky is.

01:15.667 --> 01:16.709
Mm-hm.

01:17.667 --> 01:18.542

Oh, yeah.

02:23.959 --> 02:24.959
I mean, who knows, Grace?

02:25.041 --> 02:27.000
He could part his hair
on the left or the right.

02:27.083 --> 02:29.250
That's just what makes Ricky, Ricky.

02:30.625 --> 02:32.000
I can't believe because of you,

02:32.083 --> 02:34.375
that over-gelled pretty boy
is coming to our school.

02:34.917 --> 02:36.083
I think he's got a doll's head.

02:37.166 --> 02:40.083
Jack, it's so predictable that a guy
like you would be jealous of Ricky

02:40.917 --> 02:42.917
What? I'm not... I'm not jealous!

02:43.291 --> 02:44.208
Mm-hm.

02:46.417 --> 02:48.333
I just don't get what the big deal is.

02:48.625 --> 02:49.500
Yeah.

02:49.583 --> 02:51.667
I don't get it either.
What do girls see in him?

02:52.208 --> 02:53.250
I have everything he does.

02:53.667 --> 02:57.125
Really? You have talent, good looks
and a private jet?

02:57.834 --> 03:00.417
Well, I have talent, good looks,
and my sister's three-speed bike.

03:01.667 --> 03:02.583
Whoa!

03:02.667 --> 03:04.417
You guys sound like a bunch of haters.

03:04.500 --> 03:07.125
You know, back in the day,
I was the lead singer in a boy band.

03:07.208 --> 03:08.291
Mm-hm.

03:08.875 --> 03:11.041
What? Straight up, yo.

03:11.125 --> 03:14.875
I was in a tight little outfit
called, "Just Us Guyz."

03:16.333 --> 03:17.166
With a "Z."

03:18.291 --> 03:19.500

03:50.166 --> 03:51.750
Well, there's more where that came from.

03:52.041 --> 03:53.417
Uh, unfortunately, It's on a cassette

03:53.500 --> 03:55.959
that's been stuck in my car's tape deck
for five years, but...

04:08.625 --> 04:10.000

Ricky Weaver!

04:17.625 --> 04:19.375
Guys, it's cool. Wait in the limo.

04:19.834 --> 04:21.834
I thought I'd stop by and say

04:21.917 --> 04:23.458
"Hey!" before the show.

04:23.875 --> 04:25.542
Ricky, you're... you're...

04:25.625 --> 04:28.250
You're here. You're standing in our dojo!

04:29.125 --> 04:30.917

- Jack, that's it.

04:35.375 --> 04:36.250
Ah, what's up?

04:37.583 --> 04:39.750
Kim, I really loved the essay you wrote.

04:40.125 --> 04:42.959
If it's cool with you, I'd like to bring
you up onstage tonight to dance with me.

04:43.458 --> 04:47.041
I'm gonna... I'm gonna be dancing
with you in front of the whole school?

04:48.333 --> 04:50.583
This is gonna make Grace's head explode!

04:53.208 --> 04:54.083
Wow!

04:54.166 --> 04:55.375
Smooth.

04:56.208 --> 04:57.083
Jack!

04:57.417 --> 04:59.709
Kim, just make sure
you wear something cute.

05:00.250 --> 05:02.333
Cute? Of... of course,
I'll wear something cute.

05:03.375 --> 05:05.500
I mean, I'm not gonna go up there
not wearing something cute.

05:05.583 --> 05:06.792
I just gotta find something cute.

05:06.875 --> 05:08.000
I'm gonna go to the cute store.

05:09.625 --> 05:10.667
Am I saying out loud?

05:10.750 --> 05:11.709
Uh, I gotta go.

05:11.917 --> 05:12.792
Bye, Kim.

05:14.041 --> 05:15.792
Seriously, I will hurt you.

05:19.083 --> 05:21.709
I knew it was you!

05:22.125 --> 05:24.333
This day, today is a crazy day.

05:24.417 --> 05:28.208
Can you believe it, Jack?
Ricky Weaver is right here in our mall!

05:29.041 --> 05:30.375
This is falafel Phil.

05:30.458 --> 05:31.875
He owns the restaurant across the way.

05:31.959 --> 05:36.041
Ricky, Ricky, Ricky.

05:36.125 --> 05:38.917
You must come to my store
and take a picture with me

05:39.000 --> 05:40.375
next to my shawarma meat.

05:41.333 --> 05:44.166
I'd love to take a picture,
but really gotta get going.

05:44.542 --> 05:47.709
- Maybe I can come back.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

05:47.792 --> 05:49.417
Hey, what happened here, huh?

05:49.500 --> 05:51.500
We were just having moments of good time,

05:51.583 --> 05:54.458
and now the walls come down
and I'm just a crazy meat-man

05:54.542 --> 05:56.208
with a goat friend in the kitchen?

05:57.500 --> 05:59.208
You've got a goat in your kitchen?

05:59.917 --> 06:01.417
Uh, what? Did I say goat?

06:01.500 --> 06:03.750
No, no, no, I meant microwave.

06:05.041 --> 06:06.208
Is okay. You go.

06:06.291 --> 06:09.125
When you come back,
I'm going to name a kebab after you.

06:09.208 --> 06:11.208
"Ricky on a sticky."

06:11.625 --> 06:13.083
Oh, this is great one.

06:13.166 --> 06:15.583
It is going to sell. Even more
than falafel on a waffle. Oh!

06:17.041 --> 06:18.709
Okay. So, uh...

06:19.667 --> 06:20.542
you met Phil.

06:20.625 --> 06:23.166
Oh man, the paparazzi showed up.

06:23.542 --> 06:24.834
How do these guys find me?

06:24.917 --> 06:27.542
Dude, you've got a purple
hummer with spinning rims,

06:27.625 --> 06:29.458
and a license plate
that says "Weavermobile."

06:31.125 --> 06:32.625
I'm gonna make a run for the parking lot.

06:33.166 --> 06:34.208
Later.

06:35.458 --> 06:37.458
There here is.
Ricky Ricky.

06:37.542 --> 06:39.208
Hope you don't mess up
your pretty doll hair.

06:40.917 --> 06:42.625
Okay, guys, that's enough. Come on!

06:42.709 --> 06:44.834
Ricky, we'll tell you when it's enough.
Just come over here

06:44.917 --> 06:46.667
- right there, right there.
- Over here, over here.

06:46.750 --> 06:49.625
Hey, hey, come on, guys. Take it easy.
You heard the man. He wants to leave.

06:49.834 --> 06:51.250
Won't you mind your own business, punk?

06:52.375 --> 06:53.792
- We got a good shot.
- Shoving?

06:53.875 --> 06:55.542
You see, I'm not a fan of the shoving.

07:18.083 --> 07:21.000
Wow, you just took out six guys.

07:21.917 --> 07:23.083
Seven, actually.

07:23.166 --> 07:24.125
But who's counting, right?

07:25.417 --> 07:26.875
You like cheeseburgers?

07:27.667 --> 07:29.875
Yeah, sure. Who doesn't like
cheeseburgers?

07:36.583 --> 07:39.458
I can't believe we went to San Francisco
for a cheeseburger!

07:40.208 --> 07:43.083
What's the fun in having a private jet
if you don't use it?

07:43.917 --> 07:45.250
Ah. Thanks, beautiful.

07:46.667 --> 07:49.041
How about some music? Do you like Jay-Z?

07:49.125 --> 07:50.709
Sure. Who doesn't like Jay-Z?

07:51.458 --> 07:55.458
Yo, Jay-Z, when you get out of the hot
tub, come up here and jam with us.

07:55.542 --> 07:57.333
Yeah, right.

07:57.917 --> 08:00.709

10:24.333 --> 10:25.583

10:43.375 --> 10:44.750
Mr. Weaver,

10:44.834 --> 10:47.542
I was getting a little worried.
You know... show starts in an hour.

10:47.625 --> 10:50.458
I had Ernie the janitor
standing by to take your place.

10:51.667 --> 10:54.333
He's never really given
up on his rock dream.

10:59.709 --> 11:00.875
Ernie!

11:01.500 --> 11:02.500
Not gonna happen.

11:05.458 --> 11:07.709
Hey, have a great show, Ricky.
And thanks for the cheeseburger.

11:08.375 --> 11:10.750
Oh, and thank Jay-Z
for signing my barf bag.

11:11.166 --> 11:12.375
Yo, hang on, Jack.

11:12.458 --> 11:14.125
Can I ask you something about Kim?

11:14.542 --> 11:15.458
If it's about the whole...

11:15.542 --> 11:17.667
...thing, it's new to me too.

11:17.750 --> 11:20.333
She's just so psyched that
she won the essay contest.

11:20.417 --> 11:22.333
Ah, it's not really a contest.

11:22.417 --> 11:25.208
My record company makes me do
these dumb school concerts,

11:25.750 --> 11:27.959
so, I just go through the pictures,

11:28.500 --> 11:29.834
and pick out the hottest girl.

11:29.917 --> 11:31.166
You know what I'm saying?

11:35.458 --> 11:36.333
Wait,

11:36.625 --> 11:37.917
so, that's why Kim won?

11:38.583 --> 11:40.417
Because she's the hottest girl?

11:40.875 --> 11:42.208
Yeah. Why?

11:42.291 --> 11:44.625
You guys don't have a thing, do you?

11:45.542 --> 11:46.375
No.

11:46.458 --> 11:49.166
Cool. Because after I dance with her,

11:49.250 --> 11:52.542
I'm gonna bring her backstage,
make my move on her,

11:53.417 --> 11:54.417
then dump her.

11:56.417 --> 11:59.667
Ricky, the hair team's chopper just landed
on the football field.

11:59.750 --> 12:02.417
Probably for the best, we're
losing by 30 points anyway.

12:05.750 --> 12:07.250
Ricky is a sleazebag.

12:08.125 --> 12:09.375
I've gotta tell Kim.

12:13.583 --> 12:16.375
Let it go, Ernie.
It's not gonna happen, okay?

12:18.250 --> 12:19.750

We are tight, all right, and out of sight!

13:19.375 --> 13:21.333
It's just a thing we used to say
back in the day.

13:21.417 --> 13:24.083
By "the day" do you mean the 1800s?

13:26.125 --> 13:27.583
I think we sound pretty good.

13:28.125 --> 13:30.667
Good? Dude, we're total swag!

13:32.500 --> 13:35.041
You can't keep making up words
and hoping they catch on.

13:36.417 --> 13:38.542
Yo, why gotta come at me
with all that flidge?

13:41.458 --> 13:43.083
Now, we just need a place to play.

13:43.667 --> 13:44.625
No, have it.

13:45.375 --> 13:47.500
Ricky Weaver's gonna launch our careers.

13:47.583 --> 13:49.625
We're gonna open for him
tonight at the school.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.166
Clearly, we're the greatest musical act
In the history of the world.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.500
But how are we gonna get on that stage?

13:56.834 --> 13:58.417
Security's gonna be all over the place.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.583
No. Security won't be a problem.

14:01.166 --> 14:03.834
You guys are not just musical artists...

14:04.083 --> 14:06.000
You are martial artists.

14:06.333 --> 14:07.583
Now, what's the name of our song?

14:08.125 --> 14:10.166
"Love Ninja?"
- I can't hear you.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.333
"Love Ninja!"

14:11.417 --> 14:13.583
And that's exactly how we're gonna
take the stage.

14:13.667 --> 14:14.750
Ninja style!

14:14.834 --> 14:15.709
- Yeah!

Wow!

14:26.500 --> 14:28.375
I've never seen you in a dress before!

14:29.166 --> 14:30.375
Are you wearing lip gloss?

14:30.458 --> 14:31.333
No!

14:31.959 --> 14:33.333
Why? Does it look okay?

14:35.041 --> 14:36.792
There's something you should
know about Ricky.

14:37.166 --> 14:38.709
The contest you won was a fake.

14:39.375 --> 14:41.417
He just looked at your picture
and thought you were cute.

14:42.125 --> 14:44.125
Ricky is not that shallow, Jack.

14:45.583 --> 14:47.583
He seriously thought I was cute?

14:48.041 --> 14:50.333
After the concert he's gonna
take you backstage,

14:50.417 --> 14:52.667
make a move on you and then dump you.

14:52.750 --> 14:54.333
He does it in every city.

14:54.834 --> 14:56.500
I know what this is about, Jack.

14:56.917 --> 14:59.375
You don't like Ricky, so you're
making up lies about him

14:59.458 --> 15:01.417
to make him sound like
some kind of monster.

15:01.917 --> 15:03.458
He <i>is</i> a monster!

15:21.041 --> 15:22.291
Here's the plan...

15:22.375 --> 15:24.959
when you hear me say,
"Give it up for the Black Belt Boys,"

15:25.041 --> 15:28.250
you jump on the ziplines, fly through
the air and land on the stage.

15:28.375 --> 15:31.542
Rudy, I have to hold my mother's
hand when I cross the street,

15:31.625 --> 15:34.500
so, flying through the air is the kind of
thing she wanna know about.

15:35.166 --> 15:37.000
Guys, it's a zipline.

15:37.083 --> 15:39.250
How hard can it be?
You just get on it, you know...

15:39.583 --> 15:40.542
zip!

15:41.291 --> 15:42.583
Why aren't you zipping with us?

15:42.667 --> 15:45.500
We're 60 feet up in the air!
Are you crazy?!

15:49.583 --> 15:53.208
Now, let's give it up
for our beloved school mascot.

15:53.291 --> 15:55.625

17:46.333 --> 17:47.542
We blew our big shot.

17:47.917 --> 17:50.834
I mean, I'm still gonna get girls, but did
you ever think about Milton and Eddie?

17:52.333 --> 17:54.500
You know what, guys? This isn't my fault.

17:54.583 --> 17:58.083
Professionals would have bounced off
that wall and started singing.

17:58.166 --> 17:59.458
The problem is you boys are soft.

17:59.875 --> 18:02.041
That's it! I'm going solo.

18:02.125 --> 18:04.000
- I'm going solo with you!
- Yeah!

Fine by me. I'm done with you guys.

18:06.500 --> 18:07.542

You know, it was kind of cool
to be back onstage again.

18:16.208 --> 18:17.709
I miss what we had.

18:18.208 --> 18:20.250
I don't even remember why we broke up.

18:20.375 --> 18:22.875
Me neither. So many good memories.

18:23.125 --> 18:26.083
I love you guys.
We've gotta get the band back together.

18:26.166 --> 18:28.250

18:32.875 --> 18:34.125

19:02.709 --> 19:03.750
Congratulations.

19:03.834 --> 19:05.166
Ah, bye-bye, Ricky.

19:07.375 --> 19:08.375
Wow.

19:08.542 --> 19:10.375
She throws pretty good for a girl.

19:11.041 --> 19:13.250
Looks like you messed around
with the wrong person.

19:13.875 --> 19:14.959
I don't understand.

19:15.041 --> 19:17.709
She's the first girl in 20 schools
who wouldn't let me kiss her.

19:20.166 --> 19:21.458
Kim's not like the others.

19:22.083 --> 19:24.917
On the outside she's
like a cute little lamb,

19:25.041 --> 19:28.208
but on the inside she's like
a vicious killer lamb.

19:29.291 --> 19:31.166

20:11.834 --> 20:13.500
- Just a little late-night workout.
Hmm.

20:16.709 --> 20:18.250
You know I can take care of myself, right?

20:18.417 --> 20:19.709
Yeah, I know.

No problem.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.250
You know...

20:30.709 --> 20:33.500
I had some really expensive cheeseburgers
for lunch today.

20:34.083 --> 20:36.834

I don't know how you do that.
Are you dumb?

20:47.709 --> 20:50.041
Yo, no! I'm telling you, Phil,

20:50.125 --> 20:51.792
you cannot be in the group anymore.

20:51.875 --> 20:53.375
What? Why?

20:53.500 --> 20:55.709
Because you are a stage hog!

20:55.792 --> 20:56.583
What?

20:58.917 --> 21:00.166
Goat hairball. Sorry.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.250
How dare you?

21:02.667 --> 21:04.792
I don't even want to be in your group
anymore, Rudy.

21:04.875 --> 21:06.041
I'm going to form my own.

21:06.417 --> 21:07.875
Eddie, do you want to be in my group?

21:07.959 --> 21:08.834
No.

- No.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.291
