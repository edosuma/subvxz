00:30.043 --> 00:31.374
We're so proud
of you.

00:31.411 --> 00:32.708
congratulations.
l can't believe that

00:32.746 --> 00:34.441
your mother's in Houston
missing all of this.

00:34.481 --> 00:35.573
l know.

00:35.615 --> 00:37.845
But l'm glad
l've got you to myself.

00:37.884 --> 00:39.647
Donna.

00:39.686 --> 00:41.950
Hi.

00:41.988 --> 00:44.149
Um, Kelly, Dad,
this is cliff Yeager,

00:44.191 --> 00:45.453
the fireman
who rescued me.

00:45.492 --> 00:47.585
Thank you, thank you
very, very much.

00:47.627 --> 00:48.525
You're welcome, sir.

00:48.562 --> 00:50.257
-Nice to meet you.
-You, too.

00:50.297 --> 00:52.857
lt's not every day
l get to rescue somebody

00:52.899 --> 00:54.298
that's protecting
a baby deer.

00:54.368 --> 00:55.995
Yeah. Now that l think
about that,

00:56.036 --> 00:58.004
it probably wasn't the
smartest thing l've ever done.

00:58.038 --> 00:59.300
And l'll second that.

00:59.406 --> 01:00.430
But l must say that you have

01:00.474 --> 01:01.498
a very brave daughter here.

01:01.541 --> 01:02.735
Thank you.

01:02.776 --> 01:03.743
But she's been like that

01:03.777 --> 01:04.834
ever since she was little.

01:04.878 --> 01:06.243
l mean, the girl
knows no fear.

01:06.313 --> 01:09.441
ls there a gag
around here? Please!

01:09.483 --> 01:10.711
l happen to be a father

01:10.751 --> 01:12.150
who's very, very proud,
that's all, please.

01:12.185 --> 01:13.243
l hate to rush this,

01:13.286 --> 01:15.015
but we are due
at the Alpha House.

01:15.055 --> 01:16.886
Yes, we have busloads of kids
coming in tomorrow

01:16.923 --> 01:18.083
to see our Haunted House,

01:18.125 --> 01:21.117
um, which doesn't exist
at the moment, so...

01:21.161 --> 01:22.185
Sounds like fun. Go.

01:22.229 --> 01:23.662
You know, if you
need any help,

01:23.697 --> 01:24.664
l'm pretty handy.

01:24.698 --> 01:25.824
Really?

01:25.866 --> 01:27.128
Are, are you serious?

01:27.167 --> 01:29.727
lf there's anything
l can do, l'd love to.

01:29.770 --> 01:32.671
Great. okay.

01:34.608 --> 01:36.872
lt's Valerie Malone again.

01:38.879 --> 01:40.471
Hi.

01:40.514 --> 01:42.141
Hi.

01:42.182 --> 01:45.549
l, uh, have a gynecologist
appointment at 4:30.

01:45.585 --> 01:47.553
l thought you might want
to meet me there.

01:47.587 --> 01:50.283
Yeah, um, thanks for telling me.

01:50.357 --> 01:51.984
That's it?

01:52.025 --> 01:55.483
Um... l'm sorry.

01:55.529 --> 01:58.157
l-l just, l just can't believe
this is happening.

01:58.198 --> 02:00.166
l thought we were
always so careful.

02:00.200 --> 02:01.758
Well, after two bottles
of champagne,

02:01.802 --> 02:03.235
no one's that careful.

02:03.270 --> 02:05.465
You know, you'd better start
dealing with this.

02:05.505 --> 02:07.871
l-l'm looking out for you,
believe me.

02:07.908 --> 02:09.239
You think your club would be
reopening tomorrow night

02:09.342 --> 02:10.502
if it weren't for me?

02:10.544 --> 02:12.478
Do you know who l'm bringing
to the show?

02:12.512 --> 02:14.742
Do you have any idea what
brokerage house he represents?

02:14.781 --> 02:16.908
Look, l'm talking about my life,
Kenny.

02:16.950 --> 02:19.145
l'm pregnant,
probably five weeks,

02:19.186 --> 02:21.154
and it's no fun going through
this alone.

02:21.188 --> 02:22.553
So, will you meet me there?

02:22.589 --> 02:25.683
of course l will.

02:25.725 --> 02:28.091
Good.

02:28.128 --> 02:31.689
That's all l wanted to hear.
Bye.

02:31.731 --> 02:33.426
Bye.

04:20.874 --> 04:22.603
Donna, Donna.

04:22.642 --> 04:24.371
Sorry.

04:24.411 --> 04:25.605
l thought
you finished hanging it.

04:25.645 --> 04:27.772
l did, but l thought l'd put it
a little higher.

04:27.814 --> 04:29.748
You know, you don't want
the sound to be so close.

04:29.783 --> 04:31.250
oh, right. Yeah, go ahead.

04:31.351 --> 04:34.184
Just, the higher you put it,
the louder l can make it.

04:34.220 --> 04:36.518
You don't want it
to be too scary.

04:36.556 --> 04:38.080
oh, the scarier the better.

04:39.893 --> 04:41.884
Don't mind her.
Last year the kids told her

04:41.928 --> 04:43.225
-it wasn't scary enough.
-Ha-ha!

04:43.263 --> 04:44.355
Gotcha.

04:46.666 --> 04:48.759
You know, you've been
a terrific help, cliff.

04:48.802 --> 04:51.965
Thanks. l didn't know
l'd have so much fun.

04:52.005 --> 04:54.269
Well, any time you have
to leave, l understand.

04:54.341 --> 04:56.206
You're not gonna get rid of me
that easy.

04:56.242 --> 04:58.608
l plan on being here tomorrow
and see it in action.

04:58.645 --> 04:59.703
You do?

04:59.746 --> 05:01.475
Yeah. l mean, l love
being around kids.

05:01.514 --> 05:03.744
l mean, that is, if it's all
right with you if l come by.

05:03.783 --> 05:05.648
Yeah, of course it's all right.

05:05.685 --> 05:07.084
Actually, it's perfect.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.418
lf you're already here,
then l don't have to invite you.

05:09.456 --> 05:10.718
okay.

05:13.159 --> 05:14.854
Hello.

05:14.894 --> 05:15.861
Hey.

05:15.895 --> 05:18.227
Great work,
if you can get it.

05:18.264 --> 05:19.993
Does this mean
you're here to help?

05:20.033 --> 05:21.159
Use me.

05:21.201 --> 05:23.499
oh, l like that.
A good unselfish attitude.

05:23.536 --> 05:26.471
l brought these
for you. Two books.

05:26.506 --> 05:27.973
You did?

05:28.008 --> 05:29.976
Well, you said you wanted
to know me better.

05:30.010 --> 05:31.238
Read them. l think

05:31.311 --> 05:33.541
they represent
my two different sides.

05:33.580 --> 05:35.070
All right.

05:35.115 --> 05:37.811
Spoon Rjver Anthology
by Edgar Lee Masters.

05:37.851 --> 05:39.478
That's the straight
shooter in me.

05:39.519 --> 05:44.149
Hmm. And Bettjng on the Muse
by charles Bukowski.

05:44.190 --> 05:45.487
And that's the madman.

05:45.525 --> 05:47.857
This is amazing.

05:47.894 --> 05:50.260
l used to go out with a guy
who loved Bukowski.

05:50.296 --> 05:52.196
Brandon's a Bukowski man?

05:52.232 --> 05:54.132
No. No, someone else.

05:54.167 --> 05:55.259
oh. Well...

05:55.335 --> 05:58.532
But Brandon is
a Masters fan.

05:59.572 --> 06:01.039
Whoops, sorry.

06:06.179 --> 06:08.704
lf that was out
of bounds,

06:08.748 --> 06:10.773
may l swallow a rubber spider
or something?

06:10.817 --> 06:13.615
You have a lot more guts
than l thought you did.

06:13.653 --> 06:15.382
lt's that Bukowski thing.

06:15.422 --> 06:18.220
Well, get to work, Spider-Man.

06:18.258 --> 06:19.987
okay.

06:25.498 --> 06:26.465
clare, l can't believe

06:26.499 --> 06:27.761
you're gonna
break up with me

06:27.801 --> 06:29.325
because l was kissing
some other girl.

06:29.369 --> 06:30.768
Watch me.
You started it.

06:30.804 --> 06:33.136
Honey, she was
kissing me.

06:33.173 --> 06:34.640
You're the one
with the wandering eyes.

06:34.674 --> 06:36.232
l mean, l thought
you'd welcome the freedom.

06:36.342 --> 06:39.106
come on, clare.

06:39.145 --> 06:42.444
Baby, l want to take you
to the After Dark party.

06:42.482 --> 06:44.143
l can't believe
you won't go with me.

06:44.184 --> 06:45.776
l'll go out with you
another time, okay?

06:45.819 --> 06:47.184
l have a date for Halloween.

06:47.220 --> 06:48.619
With who?

06:53.727 --> 06:56.355
Richard Harrison?!
l hate that guy!

06:56.396 --> 06:57.829
The guy's a dork!

06:57.864 --> 06:59.957
Well, l guess l must be going
through a dork phase, then,

06:59.999 --> 07:00.966
because l think Dick's cool.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.968
clare...

07:03.002 --> 07:04.560
Relax, okay?

07:04.604 --> 07:06.071
l'm not gonna rub
your face in it.

07:06.106 --> 07:07.801
oh, is that supposed
to make me feel better?

07:07.841 --> 07:11.402
Baby, l know you want
to go to the After Dark.

07:11.444 --> 07:15.938
Why are you gonna deny
yourself this?

07:15.982 --> 07:17.779
Honey, come to
the After Dark.

07:17.817 --> 07:20.411
Fine, l'll go... with Dick.

07:23.256 --> 07:24.883
Great, then l'll get a date.

07:24.924 --> 07:26.755
What, is this a contest now?

07:26.793 --> 07:28.522
No, war.

07:36.469 --> 07:40.803
Rave, slam, rave, slam,
likes Tracy, loves Tracy,

07:40.840 --> 07:42.501
wants to see more
of Tracy's legs,

07:42.542 --> 07:44.134
wants to see more
of Tracy's feet,

07:44.177 --> 07:46.111
wants to lick
Tracy's feet...

07:46.146 --> 07:48.114
wants to clip
her toenails.

07:48.148 --> 07:49.479
This is a good one.

07:49.516 --> 07:52.076
Well, after one month,
l'd say our newscast has

07:52.118 --> 07:54.484
a favorability rating
of about plus-15.

07:54.521 --> 07:55.783
Very scientific
my man.

07:55.822 --> 07:58.222
Hey, your job is to keep
producing a good show.

07:58.258 --> 07:59.987
My job is to keep
a positive spin.

08:00.026 --> 08:01.118
Well, one thing's
for sure,

08:01.161 --> 08:03.129
even people who slam
our newscast love Tracy.

08:03.163 --> 08:05.324
Well, you see, that's why
it's such a shame.

08:05.365 --> 08:07.196
l mean, with all
her popularity,

08:07.233 --> 08:09.565
she still doesn't have
a date to the After Dark.

08:11.771 --> 08:13.033
l'm sorry, chuck Woolery,

08:13.072 --> 08:15.040
l didn't realize we were
on Love ConneCtjon,

08:15.074 --> 08:17.133
Why exactly is that our problem?

08:17.177 --> 08:18.769
Well, l just happen to know

08:18.812 --> 08:21.110
that she's hoping
that you'll ask her.

08:21.147 --> 08:22.114
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

08:22.148 --> 08:24.207
And why are you so concerned?

08:24.250 --> 08:26.548
could it be that you're
feeling guilty already

08:26.586 --> 08:29.020
because you invited
a certain Miss Kelly Taylor?

08:29.055 --> 08:31.489
Does it bother you that l'm
going with your old girlfriend?

08:31.524 --> 08:33.650
None of my business.
lf she's happy, l'm happy.

08:33.693 --> 08:36.355
cool.
But you do like Tracy, right?

08:36.395 --> 08:37.488
of course, l like Tracy.

08:37.530 --> 08:39.020
Everyone likes Tracy.
Tracy's great.

08:39.065 --> 08:41.966
l just don't want to make the
same mistake l made last year

08:42.001 --> 08:43.366
and get involved with someone
l'm working with.

08:43.403 --> 08:44.370
okay, okay.

08:44.404 --> 08:45.871
l just know that she wants

08:45.905 --> 08:47.338
to go with you, that's all.

08:47.373 --> 08:49.705
Why are you so interested
in this?

08:49.742 --> 08:52.472
l just want to keep
my anchor smiling, that's all.

08:58.017 --> 08:59.006
Well, thanks, David.

08:59.052 --> 09:00.644
-Ah, no problem.
-Hey.

09:00.687 --> 09:01.915
-Hey, Dave,
-Huh?

09:01.955 --> 09:03.479
do you have your
neighbor's phone number?

09:03.523 --> 09:04.922
l need it
for an emergency.

09:04.958 --> 09:06.050
Why?

09:06.092 --> 09:07.684
l need a date
for Halloween.

09:07.727 --> 09:09.592
You know what?

09:09.629 --> 09:12.063
l think they just went
to chicago for a trade show.

09:12.098 --> 09:13.861
What happened
with clare?

09:13.900 --> 09:15.424
She's going
with someone else.

09:15.468 --> 09:17.333
By the way
things are going here,

09:17.370 --> 09:20.134
l'll be there by myself.
l need help.

09:20.173 --> 09:22.141
Well, maybe l can call

09:22.175 --> 09:23.199
some of my cocktail
waitresses.

09:23.309 --> 09:24.970
Maybe they got
a friend.

09:25.011 --> 09:26.979
Mm... l need
a substantial woman,

09:27.013 --> 09:30.073
a real...
crazy female.

09:30.116 --> 09:31.083
Think! Think!

09:31.117 --> 09:32.516
okay, okay, uh...

09:32.552 --> 09:34.816
l told him to try
the Elite Escort Service.

09:34.854 --> 09:36.515
l'm not looking
for a hooker.

09:36.556 --> 09:38.421
This service is
on the level.

09:38.458 --> 09:39.857
There's no sex involved.

09:39.893 --> 09:41.360
The owner's a
regular here.

09:41.394 --> 09:42.884
They cater to
corporate execs

09:42.929 --> 09:46.057
and diplomats, you know,
for people that need company

09:46.099 --> 09:47.964
for special events.

09:48.001 --> 09:50.401
And the women that work for them
are bright and beautiful.

09:50.436 --> 09:52.836
lf l mention your name,
will l get a discount?

09:52.872 --> 09:54.271
No.

09:56.876 --> 09:58.138
Hey, Dad.

09:58.177 --> 10:00.338
l thought you were supposed
to be in Palm Springs.

10:00.380 --> 10:01.711
Hey. We're just
heading out.

10:01.748 --> 10:03.841
Your little sister wanted
a piece of pie for the road.

10:05.385 --> 10:07.910
Uh, tell Grandma and Grandpa
l said hello.

10:07.954 --> 10:09.512
lt's not too late to come.

10:09.555 --> 10:11.921
l can't. l just promised Valerie

10:11.958 --> 10:14.449
l'd emcee this little show
she's doing tomorrow.

10:14.494 --> 10:16.155
So fly back.

10:16.195 --> 10:18.686
There's plenty of time.
lt's his birthday.

10:18.731 --> 10:21.928
His birthday isn't
until next month.

10:21.968 --> 10:23.959
David, l told you
he's gonna be on a cruise.

10:24.003 --> 10:26.904
So we're having a little party
tonight to celebrate early.

10:26.940 --> 10:29.374
lt's his 7 1st birthday. come.

10:29.409 --> 10:31.138
l said l can't.
l have other plans.

10:31.177 --> 10:34.374
You know, l didn't want
to make a big deal out of this,

10:34.414 --> 10:36.882
but you do have
family responsibilities.

10:36.916 --> 10:39.441
come on, Dad, l see Grandpa
all the time.

10:39.485 --> 10:40.713
Don't give me that.

10:40.753 --> 10:41.583
Why are you getting so angry?

10:41.621 --> 10:42.588
l'm not angry.

10:42.622 --> 10:43.782
Look, you pay my rent,

10:43.823 --> 10:45.552
and l promised to stay
in school, all right?

10:45.591 --> 10:48.151
But you can't keep making me
do things l don't want to do.

10:50.063 --> 10:51.826
l'm sorry.

10:51.864 --> 10:53.661
Knowing how much you love
your grandfather,

10:53.700 --> 10:56.260
l just thought it might be
something you wanted to do.

10:58.471 --> 11:00.803
Well, l'm sorry.

11:01.975 --> 11:03.943
Tell Grandpa
l said Happy Birthday.

11:03.977 --> 11:05.103
Sure.

11:05.144 --> 11:07.271
See ya.

11:16.489 --> 11:18.616
l tell you,
l couldn't be happier.

11:18.658 --> 11:20.558
Frank and l have
been trying so hard.

11:20.593 --> 11:23.084
lf my home pregnancy test hadn't
had turned blue this time,

11:23.129 --> 11:24.460
l was gonna dye it blue.

11:24.497 --> 11:26.556
l don't think that works.

11:26.599 --> 11:28.191
l've heard that it does.

11:29.335 --> 11:30.267
Well, good luck.

11:30.336 --> 11:31.496
Thank you.

11:31.537 --> 11:33.368
lf you're in a hurry
to see the doctor,

11:33.406 --> 11:34.703
you can go ahead of me.

11:34.741 --> 11:36.140
l'm in no rush to get home.

11:36.175 --> 11:37.233
No, that's okay.

11:37.276 --> 11:38.538
l didn't have an appointment
anyway.

11:38.578 --> 11:40.375
So l'll come back. Thanks.

11:48.554 --> 11:50.078
How'd it go?

11:51.758 --> 11:53.851
How did you think
it was gonna go?

11:53.893 --> 11:55.861
l'm still pregnant...

11:55.895 --> 11:57.294
nearly five weeks.

11:57.397 --> 11:58.921
Damn it.

11:58.965 --> 11:59.761
Damn it?

12:01.801 --> 12:03.792
Wait, l'm the one who's
unmarried and having your baby,

12:03.836 --> 12:05.326
and all you can say
is ''damn it?''

12:05.371 --> 12:10.240
l'm sorry, Val.
l-l just don't know what to say.

12:10.343 --> 12:12.334
l mean, l feel so bad for you.

12:14.680 --> 12:16.079
You know what?

12:16.115 --> 12:18.879
l... l thought
l was gonna feel bad, too,

12:18.918 --> 12:21.045
but... but l actually don't.

12:21.087 --> 12:24.022
-You don't?
-No.

12:24.057 --> 12:28.653
l mean, l've thought about it
and... and l love you

12:28.694 --> 12:30.389
and l want to have your baby.

12:30.430 --> 12:34.696
Valerie, you can't have
this baby.

12:36.436 --> 12:37.630
Well, why?

12:37.670 --> 12:40.764
Because, honey,
it would ruin everything.

12:40.807 --> 12:41.933
lt would ruin everything.

12:41.974 --> 12:43.202
You gotta know that.

12:43.242 --> 12:45.176
l know you do.

12:45.211 --> 12:47.270
l do.

12:47.313 --> 12:51.044
But don't make me lose
you, too. lt's not fair.

12:51.084 --> 12:53.416
l mean, honey,
we belong together.

12:53.453 --> 12:55.284
l mean, don't you feel it?

12:55.321 --> 12:58.222
l mean, maybe this accident
was a blessing.

12:58.257 --> 13:00.487
l mean, maybe it was a sign
telling you

13:00.526 --> 13:01.993
that you need
to change your life.

13:02.028 --> 13:03.586
-Val...
-People get divorced,

13:03.629 --> 13:06.223
and children deal with it,
life goes on,

13:06.299 --> 13:08.824
but it all comes down to love.

13:08.868 --> 13:12.395
And you told me
that you loved me.

13:12.438 --> 13:13.928
Was that a lie?

13:15.741 --> 13:19.233
l love you so much.

13:21.581 --> 13:23.572
Then you need
to listen to your heart.

13:26.419 --> 13:27.818
l know.

13:27.854 --> 13:29.845
And you need to tell
your wife about me.

13:33.159 --> 13:34.649
l know.

13:37.296 --> 13:39.161
l love you.

13:43.035 --> 13:44.764
You'd better go.

14:06.692 --> 14:09.661
l'm Tracy Gaylian,
and that's cUTV news.

14:12.031 --> 14:13.931
That's a wrap.
Thank you, Tracy.

14:13.966 --> 14:15.558
We're clear.

14:18.604 --> 14:19.935
That was good.

14:19.972 --> 14:21.997
l bet you didn't like
that editorial l worked in

14:22.041 --> 14:23.474
about more trash pickups
in the dorms.

14:23.509 --> 14:25.238
l took it for what it was.

14:25.344 --> 14:26.368
Which was?

14:26.412 --> 14:27.879
A very petty gripe.

14:27.914 --> 14:29.347
You obviously don't
live in the dorms.

14:29.382 --> 14:30.349
No, no, l don't,

14:30.383 --> 14:32.010
but you know, it had...

14:32.051 --> 14:33.643
it had spontaneity,
it had feeling,

14:33.686 --> 14:35.051
it had, it had heart,

14:35.087 --> 14:37.078
it had a certain
je ne sajs quoj, if you will.

14:37.123 --> 14:38.715
l don't know.
lt got me thinking,

14:38.758 --> 14:40.385
maybe we should have
a ''Petty Gripe

14:40.426 --> 14:42.417
-of The Week'' segment.
-l knew you didn't like it.

14:42.461 --> 14:43.655
No, you're right, l didn't.

14:43.696 --> 14:44.993
Next time just stick
to the rundown, will you?

14:45.031 --> 14:46.020
Yes, okay.

14:46.065 --> 14:47.532
okay.

14:47.567 --> 14:50.001
Hey, Trace, um...

14:50.036 --> 14:51.901
look, l know it's
kind of last minute

14:51.938 --> 14:53.599
and everything,
but, uh, would you like

14:53.639 --> 14:56.233
to go to the Halloween party
at the After Dark with me?

14:56.275 --> 15:00.109
Um...

15:00.146 --> 15:01.579
l can't. l'm sorry.

15:01.614 --> 15:03.582
You can't?

15:03.616 --> 15:05.550
You got a date?

15:07.286 --> 15:10.517
No. l've actually been looking
forward to going by myself.

15:11.891 --> 15:13.859
But thanks for asking.

15:35.581 --> 15:38.516
l don't know about you, Mabel,

15:38.551 --> 15:41.384
but l want the little boy
in the red sneakers for dinner!

15:41.420 --> 15:42.785
oh, Eunice, he's no good.

15:42.822 --> 15:44.187
Even if you've
got a good meal

15:44.223 --> 15:45.451
out of him, he'd be sour.

15:45.491 --> 15:47.857
Just take them
to the kitchen now!

15:51.697 --> 15:56.657
oh... so, what do you
think about cliff?

15:56.702 --> 15:59.466
Well, l think he's got a good
body for the headless horseman.

16:01.274 --> 16:02.866
He told me he was in the navy.

16:02.908 --> 16:04.136
Well, is that good or bad?

16:04.176 --> 16:05.404
l don't know.

16:05.444 --> 16:07.674
Actually, l don't know
that much about him.

16:07.713 --> 16:10.204
Well, why don't you ask him
which book best describes him?

16:10.316 --> 16:11.840
lt can be very revealing.

16:11.884 --> 16:13.317
Hmm.

16:13.352 --> 16:14.683
ooh, here they come.

16:14.720 --> 16:16.847
oh.

16:16.889 --> 16:21.383
Welcome to your nightmare!
Ha, ha!

16:23.462 --> 16:26.226
Welcome to your nightmare!
Ha, ha, ha!

16:26.299 --> 16:28.665
oh, l think he scared
that little boy.

16:28.701 --> 16:30.225
Here.

16:30.269 --> 16:32.237
-Ah!
-cover for me.

16:32.271 --> 16:34.933
okay. Um...

16:37.376 --> 16:39.344
Hey, are you all right?

16:39.378 --> 16:40.504
Yeah, l'm afraid

16:40.546 --> 16:41.604
l freaked him a bit.

16:41.647 --> 16:43.342
oh, sweetie, what's your name?

16:43.382 --> 16:46.215
Alex. l want to go home.

16:46.252 --> 16:47.446
You sure about that?

16:47.486 --> 16:49.010
Everyone else is having fun
in there.

16:49.055 --> 16:52.081
lf l stay, everybody's
gonna make fun of me.

16:52.124 --> 16:54.456
l'm the only one afraid
to go in the haunted house.

16:54.493 --> 16:56.688
Well, l think
l can take care of that.

16:56.729 --> 17:00.256
Donna, can you use some help
in the control room?

17:00.299 --> 17:01.596
Absolutely.

17:01.634 --> 17:03.795
Uh-uh, l'm not going back
in there.

17:03.836 --> 17:04.803
lt's too scary.

17:04.837 --> 17:07.101
Not if you're doing the scaring.

17:10.843 --> 17:14.540
We have a large database
of incredible women.

17:14.579 --> 17:16.411
We have ladies
who can tell you

17:16.449 --> 17:17.939
the dollar conversion
of the yen

17:17.983 --> 17:21.077
and others who can sink
a 40-foot putt.

17:21.119 --> 17:24.817
Hey, that's great.
Nat said you were the best.

17:24.857 --> 17:27.051
Well, Nat's not so bad himself.

17:27.093 --> 17:29.118
l've been eating megaburgers

17:29.161 --> 17:30.788
since before you were born,
doll.

17:30.830 --> 17:32.627
But if you say it shows,
you don't get the discount.

17:32.665 --> 17:34.223
okay, my lips are sealed.

17:34.333 --> 17:35.561
You're a good boy.

17:35.601 --> 17:37.865
So just fill in the number
of the lady you select

17:37.903 --> 17:39.894
and give your clipboard
to Petra at reception.

17:39.939 --> 17:41.736
-okay, l got it.
-Good.

17:41.774 --> 17:43.071
Please excuse me.

17:43.109 --> 17:45.009
l have to go sink
a 40-foot putt.

17:45.044 --> 17:47.478
Good luck!

17:47.513 --> 17:48.775
Whew!

17:53.786 --> 17:54.946
Mm...

17:54.987 --> 17:58.582
''Hedda, Swedish-American,
number 167.'' Hmm.

18:05.631 --> 18:08.600
oh, no!

18:08.634 --> 18:10.124
Do you need a hand?

18:12.471 --> 18:14.632
No, l'm, l'm fine.

18:14.673 --> 18:16.903
Uh, 1 76.

18:16.942 --> 18:17.909
All right.

18:17.943 --> 18:19.467
can you fill it out for me?

18:19.512 --> 18:22.140
certainly. 1 76.
For tonight?

18:22.181 --> 18:25.548
Yeah. There's a big Halloween
party at the After Dark.

18:25.584 --> 18:26.812
lt's a black-and-white bash.

18:26.852 --> 18:28.843
l'll take care
of all the arrangements

18:28.888 --> 18:30.082
right away,
Mr. Sanders.

18:30.122 --> 18:31.316
Thanks.

18:34.293 --> 18:36.454
Whew!

18:40.599 --> 18:43.466
Hey, wash your hands.
Everything's ready.

18:45.805 --> 18:48.365
l'm really not very hungry,

18:48.407 --> 18:51.706
and unfortunately,
l can't stay.

18:53.412 --> 18:56.609
l'm sorry. l should
have called you first.

18:56.649 --> 18:58.139
Why didn't you?

19:00.719 --> 19:03.381
You didn't tell her yet,
did you?

19:06.592 --> 19:08.025
l'm sorry, Val.

19:08.060 --> 19:11.496
okay. Well, then l will.

19:11.530 --> 19:13.498
or would you rather have
my doctor tell her

19:13.532 --> 19:14.829
that you're the father?

19:14.867 --> 19:18.359
Valerie, please, please,
don't be mad at me.

19:18.404 --> 19:21.066
l mean, l've really, really
considered this.

19:21.106 --> 19:23.438
l have sat up
night after night,

19:23.476 --> 19:27.742
imagining how much better
my life would be with you.

19:27.780 --> 19:29.213
And?

19:29.281 --> 19:30.771
l think about my son.

19:30.816 --> 19:33.046
l think about Michael.

19:33.085 --> 19:36.452
Why is he any more important
than our child?

19:41.327 --> 19:44.228
How do l really know
this is my kid?

19:44.330 --> 19:46.628
You bastard.

19:48.267 --> 19:52.431
You seduced me with lies
about leaving your wife...

19:53.439 --> 19:54.667
you knocked me up,

19:54.707 --> 19:56.072
and now you think
it's someone else's?

19:56.108 --> 19:57.405
Are you telling me
it's impossible?

19:57.443 --> 19:59.001
l'm saying our child deserves

19:59.044 --> 20:00.602
as much as your wife's.

20:05.718 --> 20:10.655
Valerie... Valerie,
l love you,

20:11.957 --> 20:13.822
but you can't have this baby.

20:13.859 --> 20:16.419
You gotta have
an abortion.

20:19.899 --> 20:22.459
Fine.

20:22.501 --> 20:24.662
lt's gonna cost you.

20:24.703 --> 20:28.605
l know. l know,
l'm prepared for that.

20:32.444 --> 20:34.639
What about $10,000?

20:34.680 --> 20:36.705
And then you can take
a nice vacation.

20:36.749 --> 20:40.981
What? You think $10,000's
gonna be okay?

20:41.020 --> 20:43.682
l know what
you're worth.

20:43.722 --> 20:45.246
What do you want?

20:47.293 --> 20:48.317
A hundred thousand.

20:50.229 --> 20:52.220
A hundred thousand?

20:52.264 --> 20:54.994
Valerie, let's not forget
about all the good things

20:55.034 --> 20:56.695
that are happening at your club,
okay?

20:56.735 --> 20:59.295
Things that can stop
just as quickly as they started.

20:59.405 --> 21:01.771
You wouldn't do anything
that stupid.

21:01.807 --> 21:02.933
Neither would you.

21:02.975 --> 21:04.670
Now,

21:04.710 --> 21:06.871
take the $10,000, okay?

21:06.912 --> 21:09.437
l mean, l still
want to see you.

21:09.481 --> 21:13.474
l'm sorry, try buying
your wife off for ten grand.

21:16.855 --> 21:18.982
Valerie...

21:19.024 --> 21:21.754
Listen, l'll see you
and your investor friend

21:21.794 --> 21:23.125
at the club tonight, okay?

21:23.162 --> 21:25.528
And don't be late.

21:31.704 --> 21:33.535
Whoa!

21:35.174 --> 21:37.039
Alex, l think you have
a future in this.

21:37.076 --> 21:38.202
Thanks.

21:38.243 --> 21:40.404
Welcome to your nightmare.

21:43.182 --> 21:44.706
You sure got him back on track.

21:44.750 --> 21:45.717
Yeah.

21:45.751 --> 21:47.241
You must come
from a big family.

21:47.286 --> 21:48.275
Nope.

21:48.387 --> 21:50.184
Well, then how'd
you know what to do?

21:50.222 --> 21:51.553
That's pretty easy.

21:51.590 --> 21:54.081
l, uh, l know
just how Alex felt.

21:54.126 --> 21:56.856
l was afraid of the dark
myself when l was a kid.

21:56.895 --> 21:58.863
You?

21:58.897 --> 22:00.125
Yeah, me.

22:00.165 --> 22:02.224
Donna, quick,
do your witch voice!

22:02.301 --> 22:03.233
They're leaving.

22:03.302 --> 22:04.769
okay. Don't go away.

22:04.803 --> 22:06.327
l want to see what
your plans are tonight.

22:06.372 --> 22:07.361
okay.

22:11.944 --> 22:13.605
Let's eat them for dinner!

22:16.649 --> 22:17.616
ooh!

22:17.650 --> 22:19.948
Excuse me.

22:19.985 --> 22:21.680
You made
a very good mummy.

22:21.720 --> 22:23.620
Yeah, my daddy would
be proud of me.

22:23.656 --> 22:25.624
So, am l gonna
see you tonight?

22:25.658 --> 22:26.647
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

22:26.692 --> 22:28.523
-Yeah.
-Good.

22:37.469 --> 22:39.369
Hey, B,
how's it going?

22:39.405 --> 22:41.839
Steve, well, let's see,

22:41.874 --> 22:43.705
l don't have a date
for the party tonight,

22:43.742 --> 22:45.073
and if l see Mark,

22:45.110 --> 22:47.442
remind me to rip his tongue
out with a baling hook.

22:47.479 --> 22:48.571
Something to do
with Kelly?

22:48.614 --> 22:50.241
-No, Tracy.
-Tracy?

22:50.282 --> 22:51.544
Why are you
all dressed up?

22:51.583 --> 22:52.743
clare have a change of heart?

22:52.785 --> 22:54.412
No. She's going
to the party with Dick.

22:54.453 --> 22:55.613
Dick Harrison.

22:55.654 --> 22:57.281
So who are you going with?

22:57.356 --> 22:59.381
Well, would you believe
l have a date

22:59.425 --> 23:01.416
with a statuesque, 22-year-old,
Swedish-American,

23:01.460 --> 23:03.155
nuclear engineering student?

23:03.195 --> 23:06.062
Uh! clare is going to shrivel
when she sees this goddess.

23:08.200 --> 23:09.929
And there's Hedda now.

23:09.968 --> 23:12.232
Does, uh, does Hedda happen
to have a seester?

23:12.304 --> 23:14.431
A seester? l don't know
if she has a sister.

23:14.473 --> 23:15.599
Maybe she does.

23:15.641 --> 23:17.506
Nice! Ay-ee!

23:17.543 --> 23:18.567
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

23:24.850 --> 23:25.874
Hel...! Hi.

23:25.918 --> 23:28.785
Hi. You must be
Steve Sanders, huh?

23:28.821 --> 23:30.584
Yeah. Who are you?

23:30.622 --> 23:32.112
Tammy lchida,

23:32.157 --> 23:33.749
your Japanese translator
for the Halloween party.

23:33.792 --> 23:36.386
Where's Hedda?

23:36.428 --> 23:37.759
Who's Hedda?

23:37.796 --> 23:39.889
Hedda, Hedda is number 1 76-a.

23:39.932 --> 23:41.991
l'm number 1 76.

23:42.034 --> 23:44.502
Hedda is 167.

23:44.536 --> 23:46.766
No, l'm sorry,
but there's been a mistake.

23:46.805 --> 23:47.794
ls it the kimono?

23:47.840 --> 23:49.205
Truth is, it was
my grandmother's.

23:49.241 --> 23:51.141
l never had a chance
to wear it before.

23:51.176 --> 23:52.905
l thought
it'd be cute.

23:52.945 --> 23:53.912
lt is cute.

23:53.946 --> 23:55.140
And you're very cute.

23:55.180 --> 23:56.579
Uh, it's just
you're the wrong girl.

23:56.615 --> 23:57.809
You know what?
Wait here.

23:57.850 --> 23:59.511
l'm gonna go call
your office, okay?

23:59.551 --> 24:01.576
oh, but the office
closes at 7:00.

24:01.620 --> 24:03.212
closes at 7:00.

24:03.288 --> 24:05.222
l'm sorry. You'll just get
the answering machine.

24:05.324 --> 24:08.020
l'm really the wrong girl?

24:08.060 --> 24:09.584
You're not interested
in yen-rate conversions?

24:11.730 --> 24:13.664
N-No.

24:13.699 --> 24:16.031
Well, l've never been
to the After Dark.

24:16.068 --> 24:17.501
couldn't we still go
to the party?

24:17.536 --> 24:19.834
Yeah, why not?

24:19.872 --> 24:21.965
come in. lt's nice to meet you.

24:23.742 --> 24:26.802
l can't believe
you asked him to take you.

24:26.845 --> 24:28.210
You don't even know the guy.

24:28.247 --> 24:29.646
Well, why shouldn't l?

24:29.681 --> 24:30.739
He rescued me.

24:30.783 --> 24:32.148
Hey, guys.

24:32.184 --> 24:35.210
oh, Kel, would you please tell
clare that cliff is nice?

24:35.254 --> 24:37.722
-cliff is a nice guy.
-See?

24:37.756 --> 24:39.383
Now you tell her about Mark.

24:39.424 --> 24:40.857
What happened to you?

24:40.893 --> 24:42.588
obviously, Mark.

24:42.628 --> 24:45.995
Hmm. He's just a lot different
than l thought he would be.

24:46.031 --> 24:47.862
-What do you mean?
-l mean,

24:47.900 --> 24:51.631
l've only loved two guys
in my life, Brandon and Dylan,

24:51.670 --> 24:55.868
and this guy seems to be
a nice blend of both of them.

24:55.908 --> 24:58.433
-Hmm.
-Kel, slow down.

24:58.477 --> 25:00.638
Don't you think you're letting
this move a little fast?

25:00.679 --> 25:02.977
Yeah, this from a girl
who's dating a sailor.

25:03.015 --> 25:03.982
l'm serious.

25:04.016 --> 25:05.347
Don't worry about me.

25:05.384 --> 25:06.316
Good.

25:06.351 --> 25:08.979
But don't wait up for me either.

25:10.055 --> 25:11.022
And l thought

25:11.056 --> 25:12.683
she was in love with Brandon.

25:12.724 --> 25:17.161
So did l. So did l.

25:31.376 --> 25:32.707
This is so awesome.

25:32.744 --> 25:34.735
At North Valley State
where l go to school,

25:34.780 --> 25:37.340
the coolest Halloween party
is at the Ag Hall.

25:37.382 --> 25:39.043
Well, l hope
you're having fun here.

25:39.084 --> 25:40.779
ls this ''clare''
here yet?

25:44.790 --> 25:46.781
Yeah, she's over there.

25:46.825 --> 25:48.554
Hey, do you dance?

25:48.594 --> 25:50.084
l can try.

25:55.834 --> 25:58.803
Mm, come here.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

26:17.856 --> 26:18.845
Brandon!

26:21.026 --> 26:22.357
Trace.

26:22.394 --> 26:23.918
Barkeep,

26:23.962 --> 26:25.862
another, and pour this one
with your right hand.

26:25.898 --> 26:28.366
-Hi.
-Hi. Happy Halloween.

26:28.400 --> 26:29.697
Thank you. You, too.

26:29.735 --> 26:32.033
Want to hang out?

26:32.070 --> 26:33.230
What're you talking about?

26:33.305 --> 26:34.829
Well, just 'cause
we didn't come together

26:34.873 --> 26:36.807
doesn't mean we can't,
you know, dance.

26:38.777 --> 26:40.108
okay, l give up,

26:40.145 --> 26:41.510
l'm confused.

26:41.546 --> 26:42.945
-Why?
-''Why?''

26:42.981 --> 26:45.245
Why didn't you just come with me
in the first place?

26:45.317 --> 26:48.844
Because l knew you were
only asking out of obligation,

26:48.887 --> 26:50.718
and l wanted a date--

26:50.756 --> 26:53.589
someone who thinks l'm pretty
and witty and available.

26:53.625 --> 26:55.991
Two out of three do?

26:56.028 --> 26:57.518
Which two?

26:57.562 --> 27:00.053
Pretty and available?
Ha-ha.

27:28.760 --> 27:30.455
Donna?

27:30.495 --> 27:31.860
Hang on.

27:35.067 --> 27:36.625
-Donna...
-Hey.

27:36.668 --> 27:39.068
Hey. You look beautiful.

27:39.104 --> 27:40.594
You, too.

27:40.639 --> 27:43.164
l'm really sorry
l'm late.

27:43.208 --> 27:45.676
oh, that's fine.
At least you called.

27:45.711 --> 27:48.680
Here.
Um, hang on one second.

27:48.714 --> 27:50.614
l just have to
grab something.

27:52.417 --> 27:54.647
Well, let me tell you,
it was some accident.

27:54.686 --> 27:57.553
l mean, just up the highway,
a truck hit a power pole.

27:57.589 --> 27:59.921
l mean, l was only
on crowd control,

27:59.958 --> 28:01.550
but it was pretty tense.

28:01.593 --> 28:06.053
The power lines were down,
sparks were flying.

28:06.098 --> 28:08.498
oh, there it goes again.

28:08.533 --> 28:10.831
Don't worry, it'll go back on
in a second.

28:13.271 --> 28:15.967
or not.

28:16.008 --> 28:18.203
l bet it's an electrical
grid scramble.

28:18.310 --> 28:19.743
That means it's gonna
be playing havoc

28:19.778 --> 28:21.075
with the traffic lights.

28:21.113 --> 28:23.843
We should probably stay put
till it comes back on.

28:23.882 --> 28:27.545
Well, um, there's a couch
in the living room

28:27.586 --> 28:29.747
if you can find it.

28:29.788 --> 28:33.986
And you can go sit
and l'll find a candle.

28:34.026 --> 28:36.893
Um, how about l just stick
with you instead?

28:36.928 --> 28:38.828
You were scared of the dark,
weren't you?

28:38.864 --> 28:40.092
Yeah, oh, yeah.

28:40.132 --> 28:41.895
l mean, l had a little blankie,

28:41.933 --> 28:45.767
and l had a special teddy bear
until l was about... nine.

28:45.804 --> 28:49.797
Not everyone was a brave
little kid like you were.

28:49.841 --> 28:52.935
oh, l wasn't always that way.

28:52.978 --> 28:54.639
l used to get scared a lot.

28:54.679 --> 28:56.579
Really?
And when did that change?

28:56.615 --> 29:02.451
Um, probably when l was,
like, seven or eight.

29:02.487 --> 29:04.955
one time l had this really,
really bad dream

29:04.990 --> 29:08.323
and l remember l woke up
and l was crying and crying.

29:08.360 --> 29:09.622
l was really scared,

29:09.661 --> 29:14.030
and, uh, then l looked
and l saw his head peering

29:14.066 --> 29:16.967
through the door right above
my Winnie the Pooh nightlight.

29:17.002 --> 29:19.664
And it was my Dad.

29:19.704 --> 29:23.970
And his face was,
was glowing, he was radiant.

29:24.009 --> 29:26.876
l don't know, maybe it was
the look on his face

29:26.912 --> 29:28.209
or it was just the moment,

29:28.246 --> 29:30.510
l knew l never had
to be scared again.

29:30.549 --> 29:32.676
Kind of like my Dad was
always watching over me.

29:32.717 --> 29:34.912
Wow.

29:34.953 --> 29:36.750
That's definitely
a confidence builder.

29:39.624 --> 29:41.615
You're an amazing
woman, Donna.

29:41.660 --> 29:43.958
l don't know why
l'm so surprised.

29:43.995 --> 29:46.486
Well, you're surprising, too.

29:47.933 --> 29:49.491
We have power.

29:49.534 --> 29:52.435
We do. Shall we go?

29:52.471 --> 29:54.496
We shall.

29:59.077 --> 30:01.978
Hi, uh, l've been trying a cell
phone number for the last hour

30:02.013 --> 30:02.980
and it's been busy.

30:03.014 --> 30:05.676
l need you to cut into 555-1377.

30:05.717 --> 30:06.979
And the name?

30:07.018 --> 30:10.385
Bannerman. Kenny Bannerman.
Thank you.

30:10.422 --> 30:13.050
l'm sorry,
that number's been disconnected.

30:13.091 --> 30:14.080
What?

30:14.126 --> 30:16.492
Disconnected?

30:16.528 --> 30:19.122
Well, can you connect me
to the new number?

30:19.164 --> 30:20.995
l'm sorry, l don't show
a new listing.

30:21.032 --> 30:22.761
Look, l need
to get ahold of him!

30:22.801 --> 30:24.268
l'm sorry.

30:24.369 --> 30:25.495
Never mind.

30:29.341 --> 30:31.400
He's not coming.

30:34.212 --> 30:35.440
So you're sure
you don't mind?

30:35.480 --> 30:36.777
-Mind what?
-Driving me home.

30:36.815 --> 30:38.544
of course l don't mind
driving you home.

30:38.583 --> 30:40.244
There's no reason
you should take a cab.

30:40.285 --> 30:42.776
okay, l just don't want you
to feel like you have to.

30:42.821 --> 30:44.379
can we not talk
about this, okay?

30:44.422 --> 30:45.855
okay, okay.

30:45.891 --> 30:47.859
l just feel bad. l mean, just
because l want to leave early

30:47.893 --> 30:49.190
doesn't mean you have to.

30:49.227 --> 30:50.285
Will you get in the car?

30:50.395 --> 30:51.692
Right.

30:51.730 --> 30:53.254
Not another word.

30:53.298 --> 30:56.699
l don't know about you,
but l could leave soon.

30:56.735 --> 30:59.033
l don't want
to go home yet.

30:59.070 --> 31:01.038
Nobody said anything
about going home.

31:01.072 --> 31:04.200
And what did you have
in mind, Mr. Reese?

31:04.242 --> 31:06.142
l don't know.

31:06.178 --> 31:08.840
ls it too late
to go to Paris?

31:08.880 --> 31:11.542
l'd like to take a walk
along the Seine with you.

31:11.583 --> 31:14.245
You are insane.

31:14.352 --> 31:16.843
But that doesn't make me
a bad person, does it?

31:24.863 --> 31:26.262
Here you go.

31:26.364 --> 31:27.831
Listen, David, l gotta go out

31:27.866 --> 31:30.027
and take care of something
for a little while.

31:30.068 --> 31:32.002
can you keep an eye
on things for me?

31:32.037 --> 31:33.504
Sure, no problem.

31:33.538 --> 31:35.199
l appreciate it.
You're a lifesaver.

31:35.240 --> 31:36.707
Hey, it beats hanging out

31:36.741 --> 31:39.175
with the family
in Palm Springs, you know?

31:40.512 --> 31:41.877
Are you okay?

31:41.913 --> 31:43.210
l will be.

31:55.694 --> 31:56.854
Hi.

31:56.895 --> 31:58.453
You're clare, right?

31:58.496 --> 32:00.555
Yeah. You're Steve's date?

32:00.599 --> 32:05.400
You know, l just met Steve,
but he's a really nice guy,

32:05.437 --> 32:07.871
and he seems to care
so much about you.

32:07.906 --> 32:10.238
How much did he pay you
to say that?

32:10.308 --> 32:12.742
oh, boy,
how did you know?

32:12.777 --> 32:14.039
Know what?

32:14.079 --> 32:15.774
That l'm
a professional escort.

32:15.814 --> 32:18.248
Really?

32:18.283 --> 32:23.118
Well, yeah, but that doesn't
mean that l don't understand

32:23.154 --> 32:25.588
when someone like Steve
is really broken-hearted.

32:25.624 --> 32:29.583
Right, that's something you pros
specialize in, isn't it?

32:41.706 --> 32:43.264
Get out of my way, Sanders.

32:43.308 --> 32:45.469
Not until you wipe that gooney
smile off your face.

32:45.510 --> 32:47.000
l'm smiling 'cause l'm happy.

32:47.045 --> 32:48.478
You're not? That's too bad.

32:48.513 --> 32:49.673
Dick, don't you get it?

32:49.714 --> 32:51.682
She's just using you
to make me jealous.

32:51.716 --> 32:52.978
Really?

32:53.018 --> 32:55.009
Well, at least l didn't have
to pay for a date.

32:55.053 --> 32:56.850
What are you
talking about?

32:56.888 --> 32:59.379
oh, Steve's date's
a hooker.

32:59.424 --> 33:00.982
What?

33:01.026 --> 33:02.493
She is not.

33:02.527 --> 33:03.926
That's cute. Deny it.

33:03.962 --> 33:06.795
come on. Let's go
before things get pathetic.

33:10.335 --> 33:12.235
What'd you tell her?

33:12.337 --> 33:13.827
l was just trying to help.

33:13.872 --> 33:15.840
l think she may have
misunderstood me.

33:15.874 --> 33:17.774
Yeah, maybe.

33:17.809 --> 33:20.972
l'm sorry, Steve.

33:21.012 --> 33:22.479
ls there anything
l can do?

33:22.514 --> 33:24.414
No. l think
you've done enough.

33:27.452 --> 33:29.682
Thanks. l had
a really nice time.

33:29.721 --> 33:31.279
Yeah, me, too.

33:33.725 --> 33:37.024
So, uh, you want
to come in?

33:37.062 --> 33:38.927
lt's all right,

33:38.963 --> 33:40.055
l understand.

33:40.098 --> 33:41.065
Hang on.

33:41.099 --> 33:42.896
l-l, uh, l didn't say no.

33:42.934 --> 33:44.868
But you didn't say yes either.

33:45.870 --> 33:47.394
Good night.

33:51.876 --> 33:53.275
Brandon!

33:53.378 --> 33:54.606
l'm sorry.
l'm just really nervous.

33:54.646 --> 33:55.772
could we start over again?

33:55.814 --> 33:57.372
Sure.

33:57.415 --> 33:58.609
You want to come in?

33:58.650 --> 34:00.379
Actually, no.

34:00.418 --> 34:01.942
No?

34:01.986 --> 34:06.514
No, but, um...
l would like a kiss good night.

34:16.634 --> 34:17.623
Good night.

34:17.668 --> 34:18.693
'Night.

34:53.838 --> 34:55.601
Diane, hi.

34:55.639 --> 34:58.541
Valerie, isn't it?
We met at the beach club.

34:58.576 --> 35:00.043
Yeah, that's right.
l'm sorry it's late,

35:00.078 --> 35:01.670
but Kenny asked me
to drop this off.

35:01.713 --> 35:03.180
Give him my best?

35:03.214 --> 35:04.374
l will.

35:10.555 --> 35:12.682
Kenny, what is this?

35:12.724 --> 35:15.318
Why is this woman
bringing you diapers?!

35:27.038 --> 35:28.505
-Hey. Good morning.
-Hey, Donna.

35:28.540 --> 35:29.837
Hey. Hi.

35:30.975 --> 35:32.943
Well, we didn't wait up for you

35:32.977 --> 35:34.672
like you asked last night.

35:34.712 --> 35:36.839
Well, that's good, 'cause
l didn't come home at all.

35:36.881 --> 35:38.439
oh, l hadn't noticed that.

35:38.483 --> 35:40.348
come on, Kel,

35:40.385 --> 35:42.250
don't you think you're moving
a little fast with this guy?

35:42.320 --> 35:43.480
Donna, don't worry.

35:43.521 --> 35:45.250
All we did was drive up
the coast,

35:45.356 --> 35:47.153
watch the sunrise, and talk.

35:47.192 --> 35:48.181
lt was very nice.

35:48.226 --> 35:49.887
Hey, Kelly,

35:49.928 --> 35:51.190
can you give us a hand
in here, please?

35:51.229 --> 35:52.218
Sure.

35:53.665 --> 35:55.132
l really like him.

35:55.166 --> 35:56.633
Good.

36:02.707 --> 36:03.674
Alex!

36:03.708 --> 36:05.403
Hi. What are you
doing here?

36:05.443 --> 36:07.843
l came to help pick up...
if l can.

36:07.879 --> 36:08.937
of course you can.

36:08.980 --> 36:10.914
This is my mother.
Mom, this is Donna.

36:10.949 --> 36:11.916
Nice to meet you.

36:11.950 --> 36:13.212
You, too. Hi.

36:13.284 --> 36:15.684
Uh, he's a great kid.

36:15.720 --> 36:16.846
Yes, he is.

36:16.888 --> 36:18.753
Thanks for being
so sensitive to him.

36:18.790 --> 36:20.121
oh, please, it was nothing.

36:20.158 --> 36:21.352
l'm really grateful

36:21.392 --> 36:23.519
to you and your boyfriend.
ls he here?

36:23.561 --> 36:25.859
Uh, no, no, he's working.

36:25.897 --> 36:29.765
And well, actually,
he's not really my boyfriend.

36:29.801 --> 36:30.859
oh, that's too bad.

36:30.902 --> 36:32.392
Alex says cliffs a super guy.

36:32.437 --> 36:35.167
Yeah, well, Alex is right.

36:35.206 --> 36:37.071
cliff is a super guy.

36:44.048 --> 36:46.710
How's things with Tracy?

36:46.751 --> 36:48.946
Gotta admit, the girl has got
my attention.

36:48.987 --> 36:49.976
oh, that's good.

36:50.021 --> 36:51.181
How're things with clare?

36:51.222 --> 36:52.382
Hopeless.

36:53.458 --> 36:54.755
l love her, but l think

36:54.792 --> 36:56.259
the best thing l can do is just

36:56.294 --> 36:57.591
forget her and move on.

36:57.629 --> 36:58.596
Well, there you go.

36:58.630 --> 36:59.597
lt's hard, but sometimes

36:59.631 --> 37:00.757
it's for the best, you know?

37:00.798 --> 37:03.631
Yeah. Well,
you forgot Kelly and moved on.

37:03.668 --> 37:05.295
Like l said, it's hard.

37:05.336 --> 37:07.429
l'm just tired of beating myself
up about this.

37:07.472 --> 37:10.305
l can't possibly be as bad
as clare says l am, can l?

37:10.341 --> 37:12.070
No, Steve, you're...

37:13.177 --> 37:14.974
You're the best Steve

37:15.013 --> 37:15.980
you can be.

37:16.014 --> 37:17.038
You know what l'm saying?

37:18.249 --> 37:19.614
You're damn right, Brandon.

37:19.651 --> 37:21.312
She doesn't want me,
l don't want her.

37:22.420 --> 37:24.217
could be opportunity knocking
now.

37:24.255 --> 37:26.655
l hope she's wearing heels.

37:32.463 --> 37:34.988
clare? Hi.

37:35.033 --> 37:37.831
Hi.

37:37.869 --> 37:41.464
l just wanted to apologize
for the way l acted last night.

37:42.674 --> 37:44.574
l thought the worst of you,
and l was wrong.

37:44.609 --> 37:46.634
You were?

37:46.678 --> 37:48.009
come in.

37:48.046 --> 37:49.604
No, l can't, actually.

37:49.647 --> 37:52.138
But l just wanted you
to know that l talked

37:52.183 --> 37:54.242
to Nat this morning,
and he set me straight

37:54.319 --> 37:55.786
about his friend's
escort business.

37:55.820 --> 37:58.118
And even though
this is one

37:58.156 --> 38:00.215
of the stupider things
you've done,

38:00.258 --> 38:02.158
l think l was a little harsh
on you and Tammy.

38:02.193 --> 38:03.490
lt's all right.

38:03.528 --> 38:05.189
No, it's not.

38:05.229 --> 38:07.663
So l called Tammy's boss
this morning

38:07.699 --> 38:09.166
to sort of, like, straighten
things out.

38:09.200 --> 38:10.497
l don't know.

38:10.535 --> 38:12.093
l guess Tammy was really upset

38:12.136 --> 38:13.125
about ruining your evening.

38:13.171 --> 38:15.935
So l told Mrs. cleveland

38:15.974 --> 38:19.466
that, um, she did
a really great job, so...

38:19.510 --> 38:21.444
Really?

38:21.479 --> 38:23.344
Well, she's a nice girl.

38:23.381 --> 38:28.318
Yeah. l don't want to be
at war with you, okay?

38:28.353 --> 38:30.218
Me either, baby.

38:30.254 --> 38:31.812
l'd better go.

38:31.856 --> 38:32.880
Hey, wait a second.

38:32.924 --> 38:34.755
What about me?

38:34.792 --> 38:35.884
Don't l get forgiven, too?

38:35.927 --> 38:37.622
l don't know.

38:37.662 --> 38:40.654
l mean, l just, l don't know
if l want to go back

38:40.698 --> 38:42.495
to the way things were,
you know?

38:42.533 --> 38:45.434
Well, what's that
supposed to mean?

38:45.470 --> 38:47.199
How're we gonna do things
differently?

38:47.238 --> 38:52.073
Well, for one, l think that
while we're seeing each other,

38:52.110 --> 38:54.476
we should be able
to see other people, too.

38:58.983 --> 39:00.507
l don't want
to see other people.

39:00.551 --> 39:04.510
l'm offering you the best
of both worlds here:

39:04.555 --> 39:06.489
an open relationship.

39:06.524 --> 39:08.287
l'm not gonna share you

39:08.326 --> 39:10.556
with a dork
like Dick Harrison, no way.

39:10.595 --> 39:12.187
Don't bag on him, okay?

39:12.296 --> 39:14.355
Look, l'm trying to do
the mature thing here.

39:14.399 --> 39:15.866
Why can you not do the same?

39:15.900 --> 39:17.595
We love
each other, right?

39:17.635 --> 39:19.159
So why don't we just see
what happens?

39:19.203 --> 39:22.138
okay, so what does that mean,
we go out as a threesome,

39:22.173 --> 39:24.198
or-or l get you to myself
every other night?

39:24.308 --> 39:25.206
How does that work, clare?

39:25.309 --> 39:27.368
Good-bye.

39:27.412 --> 39:29.880
Thanks once again for proving
how immature you can be.

39:46.097 --> 39:47.860
l've been waiting.

39:49.801 --> 39:52.565
Well, there's a switch.

39:52.603 --> 39:53.729
How are you doing?

39:53.771 --> 39:55.705
lt took me two hours
to convince my wife

39:55.740 --> 39:58.607
that there was nothing going on
after that ironic little prank

39:58.643 --> 40:01.237
you pulled last night.

40:01.279 --> 40:02.769
Let's keep this brief.

40:02.814 --> 40:05.248
Well, you should have come
to the club with your friend

40:05.283 --> 40:06.944
like you were supposed to.

40:06.984 --> 40:09.782
You want to play hardball?
l can play harder.

40:09.821 --> 40:12.449
Game's over, Valerie.

40:12.490 --> 40:14.720
What's this?

40:14.759 --> 40:17.250
A check for a hundred grand.

40:17.328 --> 40:20.456
That's very generous.

40:20.498 --> 40:23.126
lt's what
you asked for.

40:23.167 --> 40:25.158
What do you expect for it?

40:25.203 --> 40:27.137
What l expect is

40:27.171 --> 40:29.264
for you to have
an abortion.

40:29.373 --> 40:31.364
Understood?

40:31.409 --> 40:33.877
Yeah, sure.

40:33.911 --> 40:35.071
l can do that.

40:35.113 --> 40:36.705
You'll hear from my attorney
tomorrow.

40:36.748 --> 40:39.216
He's gonna need you to sign some
papers about confidentiality

40:39.250 --> 40:42.549
and about absolving me
of anything more.

40:42.587 --> 40:43.611
You clear on that?

40:43.654 --> 40:45.178
crystal.

40:45.223 --> 40:46.690
So this is it?

40:46.724 --> 40:48.021
This is it.

41:09.914 --> 41:11.711
Hello.

41:11.749 --> 41:13.979
David.

41:14.018 --> 41:16.350
Dad?

41:16.387 --> 41:18.480
David, l have some bad news
for you.

41:20.658 --> 41:22.888
Your grandfather died
this morning.

41:28.065 --> 41:29.464
What?

41:29.500 --> 41:33.960
Yeah, he was helping your mom
into the house

41:34.005 --> 41:38.271
with some groceries,
and he just collapsed

41:38.309 --> 41:39.537
on the street.

41:47.552 --> 41:48.780
No.

41:48.820 --> 41:51.550
He went very quickly.

41:51.589 --> 41:56.617
He, uh...

41:56.661 --> 41:59.858
he died in the ambulance
on the way to the hospital.

41:59.897 --> 42:02.661
They couldn't save him.

42:05.770 --> 42:07.135
No!
