WEBVTT

01:31.760 --> 01:35.760
(HICCUPS)

01:44.920 --> 01:48.920
Oh, hell!

01:54.720 --> 01:56.320
I've been thinking about
our night together.

01:56.320 --> 01:57.680
Still?

01:57.680 --> 01:59.760
Fiscus' death
and resurrection

01:59.760 --> 02:01.200
reignited
our relationship.

02:01.200 --> 02:03.280
Lucy, you
give me fever.

02:03.280 --> 02:06.400
Take acetaminophen.

02:06.400 --> 02:09.120
I look at you, I see visions
of sun-drenched Greek isles

02:09.120 --> 02:10.320
and the wine-dark sea.

02:10.320 --> 02:12.240
Spare me
the travelogue.

02:12.240 --> 02:13.600
Let's go out.

02:13.600 --> 02:16.240
We'll have conversation

02:16.240 --> 02:17.800
over tossed salad
and creamy vinaigrette.

02:17.800 --> 02:20.000
Get to know
one another.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.040
You'll meet
a new, mature Victor.

02:22.040 --> 02:23.240
Forget about it.

02:23.240 --> 02:25.480
We've had our yucks.
We're history.

02:25.480 --> 02:26.920
Besides, I've met
someone else.

02:26.920 --> 02:28.920
Someone else!
Who? Who?

02:28.920 --> 02:30.240
His name is Bing.

02:30.240 --> 02:33.720
You can't go out
with a guy named Bing.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.360
I'm sorry
I told you.

02:35.360 --> 02:37.760
Does he "buh-buh-buh"
in your ear?

02:37.760 --> 02:39.040
Get lost!

02:39.040 --> 02:42.400
I'd forgotten the tsunami
of paperwork in this job.

02:42.400 --> 02:45.440
Paperwork is all part
of life's rich pageant.

02:45.440 --> 02:46.560
Why are you so chipper.

02:46.560 --> 02:47.840
It's Friday.

02:47.840 --> 02:50.920
Donald and I are going
to O'Quinn's for drinks.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.600
O'Quinn's has
all the ambience
of a submarine.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.000
It grows on you.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.480
Like tinea cruris.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.880
I don't care.
I'm crawling the walls.

02:58.880 --> 03:00.560
Richard's been
in Schenectady for two weeks

03:00.560 --> 03:02.720
trying to settle
a meat packers' strike.

03:02.720 --> 03:04.480
Donald needs
a night out.

03:04.480 --> 03:07.680
He's been down since
the break-up with Carol.

03:07.680 --> 03:10.360
That'll teach him
to get involved
with residents.

03:10.360 --> 03:11.800
Have a nice weekend.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.040
Fat chance.

03:13.040 --> 03:15.000
I've got to go downtown
and meet with some functionary

03:15.000 --> 03:17.720
from the Soviet
consulate in New York.

03:17.720 --> 03:19.680
Are you
planning a trip?

03:19.680 --> 03:21.920
No. I'm sponsoring
the immigration

03:21.920 --> 03:23.960
of a dissident
Soviet surgeon.

03:23.960 --> 03:25.280
Really?

03:25.280 --> 03:27.160
My housekeeper's
husband, Yuri Peltrovich.

03:27.160 --> 03:29.520
I should have
my head examined

03:29.520 --> 03:32.440
for letting Ellen
talk me into this.

03:32.440 --> 03:34.680
Are you coming down
with something?

03:34.680 --> 03:36.120
Just my chronic PND.

03:36.120 --> 03:39.480
Postnasal drip is all part
of life's rich pageant.

03:39.480 --> 03:42.160
Did you give
Mr Thomas his Demerol?

03:42.160 --> 03:46.160
Just now.

04:05.280 --> 04:09.280
(HICCUPS)

04:09.600 --> 04:11.440
Elliot, what's shakin'?

04:11.440 --> 04:13.200
Changing
of the guard.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.200
I thought you were on
your way to the Big Apple.

04:15.200 --> 04:18.120
I'll fly out
first thing Sunday AM

04:18.120 --> 04:20.279
as soon as that wingding
Barry Wexler relieves me.

04:20.279 --> 04:24.120
Know how long
I've waited to see
the Chinese acrobats?

04:24.120 --> 04:26.040
I can't imagine.

04:26.040 --> 04:27.760
Third row centre.

04:27.760 --> 04:29.360
40 bucks.

04:29.360 --> 04:30.680
That's the ticket.

04:30.680 --> 04:33.040
I can't wait.
I haven't had a free
weekend since Memorial Day.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.480
Who you got?

04:34.480 --> 04:35.760
Nova.

04:35.760 --> 04:38.320
The woman,
not the series.

04:38.320 --> 04:42.320
See you later.

04:45.200 --> 04:47.120
Mrs Nova?

04:47.120 --> 04:48.880
That's... (HICCUP) ..me.

04:48.880 --> 04:50.960
Right... (HICCUP) ..here.

04:50.960 --> 04:52.400
(HICCUPS)

04:52.400 --> 04:54.320
You think
this is funny?

04:54.320 --> 04:55.600
No, ma'am.

04:55.600 --> 04:56.720
Smart aleck!

04:56.720 --> 05:00.160
I hope you...hiccup
for 36 hours straight.

05:00.160 --> 05:02.400
Tried putting
a paper bag
over your head?

05:02.400 --> 05:04.120
No, I haven't.

05:04.120 --> 05:05.720
Follow me.

05:05.720 --> 05:08.120
Luther, let me
use that bag.

05:08.120 --> 05:10.360
Come on.

05:10.360 --> 05:14.360
It's always
worked for me.

05:17.720 --> 05:21.720
Smells like tuna
in here.

05:24.920 --> 05:28.920
(HICCUPS)

05:29.160 --> 05:30.840
Jackie, hi.
Looking for you.

05:30.840 --> 05:32.120
Hi, Seth.

05:32.120 --> 05:33.240
How are you?

05:33.240 --> 05:34.520
Coping.

05:34.520 --> 05:36.760
I'm sorry I didn't get
a chance to say yes

05:36.760 --> 05:38.680
when you
asked me out.

05:38.680 --> 05:41.200
I know, what with your divorce,
it wasn't easy for you.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.720
10th Grade
all over again.

05:42.720 --> 05:46.720
It took me all night
to ask Ray Chanoff
to dance.

05:46.960 --> 05:49.200
He looked at me
and said,

05:49.200 --> 05:50.680
"I don't think so."

05:50.680 --> 05:51.760
I'm sorry.

05:51.760 --> 05:53.360
You made me
feel like a fool.

05:53.360 --> 05:55.520
I hope the offer's
still open.

05:55.520 --> 05:55.920
Why?

05:55.920 --> 05:58.320
Why?

05:58.320 --> 05:59.760
Dinner, a movie.
Tonight.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.200
You don't want me.

06:01.200 --> 06:03.840
I mean,
I'm hovering around 30.

06:03.840 --> 06:04.920
What do you mean?

06:04.920 --> 06:07.760
Well, everyone knows
you like younger women.

06:07.760 --> 06:10.280
20, 21,
Lizzie Westphall.

06:10.280 --> 06:11.520
Oh.

06:11.520 --> 06:13.280
Uh, uh...

06:13.280 --> 06:15.680
"Oh. Uh, uh,"
is right.

06:15.680 --> 06:19.680
I just wonder what
the two of you
talk about.

06:22.080 --> 06:26.080
Bing?

06:27.080 --> 06:31.080
No cherry jokes.

06:32.320 --> 06:35.680
Great idea coming
here tonight.

06:35.680 --> 06:38.080
I didn't want to spend
another Friday night
with the laundry.

06:38.080 --> 06:40.840
Laundry's all part
of life's rich pageant.

06:40.840 --> 06:41.920
Donald.

06:41.920 --> 06:43.360
David, how are you?

06:43.360 --> 06:45.720
Right as rain,
whatever that means.

06:45.720 --> 06:47.680
Donald Westphall,
St Eligius.

06:47.680 --> 06:49.280
Brendan Connolly,
Harvard.

06:49.280 --> 06:51.480
How do you do?

06:51.480 --> 06:53.280
How do you do? Helen Rosenthal,
also St Eligius.

06:53.280 --> 06:54.240
Hello.

06:54.240 --> 06:55.320
Hello.

06:55.320 --> 06:56.680
Would you like
to join us?

06:56.680 --> 06:57.720
Thank you.

06:57.720 --> 06:59.680
Brendan Connolly,
the poet?

06:59.680 --> 07:03.200
You've heard of me,
but not read me, right?

07:03.200 --> 07:04.800
Nobody reads
poetry nowadays.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.040
I have a well-thumbed,
dog-eared copy

07:07.040 --> 07:08.920
of Atlantis Rising
at home.

07:08.920 --> 07:11.840
A man of perspicacity
and taste.

07:11.840 --> 07:12.920
Oh, yes.

07:12.920 --> 07:14.400
Oh,
these salt peanuts.

07:14.400 --> 07:17.240
I'm drier
than a spinster
on Saturday night.

07:17.240 --> 07:18.720
What are
you drinking?

07:18.720 --> 07:19.760
Irish.

07:19.760 --> 07:21.880
The nectar
of the gods.

07:21.880 --> 07:23.280
The universal
solvent.

07:23.280 --> 07:25.680
We'll have a round
of Jameson's.

07:25.680 --> 07:27.160
Doubles,
straight up.

07:27.160 --> 07:29.080
Sweet as love
and money.

07:29.080 --> 07:31.280
I'll feel this
in the morning.

07:31.280 --> 07:34.040
If you can't feel it
in the morning,

07:34.040 --> 07:36.280
why do it
the night before?

07:36.280 --> 07:39.000
Some of us are
too old to carouse.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.760
There's not enough
candle to burn.

07:40.760 --> 07:43.960
You've plenty
of wick left.

07:43.960 --> 07:47.800
As the ancient sage,
Satchel Paige, once said,

07:47.800 --> 07:50.800
"Age is simply a case
of mind over matter.

07:50.800 --> 07:53.680
"If you don't mind,
it doesn't matter."

07:53.680 --> 07:55.920
Ah! Here's
to whisky and song,

07:55.920 --> 07:57.360
beautiful women, poetry,

07:57.360 --> 08:00.520
and the wild horses
of the spirit.

08:00.520 --> 08:04.520
Well, here's
to your horse.

08:10.720 --> 08:13.200
Please be patient.

08:13.200 --> 08:15.440
I've tried
everything.

08:15.440 --> 08:17.200
This usually
works for me.

08:17.200 --> 08:19.160
You're
some doctor, chubby.

08:19.160 --> 08:21.040
Have her
hold her breath

08:21.040 --> 08:22.320
till she turns blue.

08:22.320 --> 08:26.320
Put me
the right way up.

08:35.880 --> 08:39.880
Drink out of
the wrong side.

08:43.240 --> 08:44.360
(CHOKES)

08:44.360 --> 08:46.920
(HICCUPS)

08:46.920 --> 08:48.840
Any other bright ideas?

08:48.840 --> 08:50.280
Mrs Nova, won't you
let us give you

08:50.280 --> 08:51.720
an injection
of chlorpromazine.

08:51.720 --> 08:53.160
It's a tranquiliser.

08:53.160 --> 08:55.080
I never take drugs.

08:55.080 --> 08:57.640
We've tried all
the alternatives.

08:57.640 --> 09:01.640
OK, OK.
I'm exhausted.

09:02.440 --> 09:03.920
The next-door neighbour

09:03.920 --> 09:07.560
dressed up like Rambo
to scare me.

09:07.560 --> 09:08.840
Did he?

09:08.840 --> 09:12.520
Out of my wits.

09:12.520 --> 09:15.120
Today's your lucky
day, Mrs Nova.

09:15.120 --> 09:18.880
You're not going
to hiccup to death.

09:18.880 --> 09:21.520
(NEIGHS LIKE HORSE)

09:21.520 --> 09:25.520
Excuse me.

09:25.920 --> 09:27.360
What's wrong?

09:27.360 --> 09:29.600
He thinks he's Mr Ed. You better
give him something before he bites.

09:29.600 --> 09:33.240
Bring him
into the ward.

09:33.240 --> 09:37.240
Wilbur.

09:38.040 --> 09:42.040
A full moon,
Friday night, and ER.

09:42.840 --> 09:45.600
That's a terrible loss
for a young man.

09:45.600 --> 09:48.120
I still miss her.

09:48.120 --> 09:50.680
And you raised
two kids alone?

09:50.680 --> 09:52.800
For the most part,
yeah.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.640
And they're happy
and healthy and beamish?

09:55.640 --> 09:58.080
Um...yeah.
For the most part.

09:58.080 --> 10:00.120
Hey, you guys.
Enough autobiography.

10:00.120 --> 10:02.040
Let's have
some funny stories,

10:02.040 --> 10:03.960
a couple
of cheap jokes.

10:03.960 --> 10:06.360
Better yet,
let's song duel.

10:06.360 --> 10:07.640
Now come on, Doc.

10:07.640 --> 10:10.480
We'll warble a tune
with gusto and panache,

10:10.480 --> 10:11.960
if not perfect pitch,

10:11.960 --> 10:13.840
and fair Helen will be

10:13.840 --> 10:15.640
the sole
and final judge.

10:15.640 --> 10:17.560
We'll compete for
her luscious heart.

10:17.560 --> 10:19.800
My luscious heart
is not up for grabs.

10:19.800 --> 10:21.800
I was speaking
metaphorically.

10:21.800 --> 10:23.200
No. I can't sing.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.400
Nonsense.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.880
No. I know
my limits, Brendan.

10:26.880 --> 10:28.320
In the shower, yes.

10:28.320 --> 10:29.720
But never in public.

10:29.720 --> 10:31.800
I'm a man
of moderation.

10:31.800 --> 10:34.720
You're as spontaneous
as the time of day.

10:34.720 --> 10:36.840
He's impugning
your sense of adventure.

10:36.840 --> 10:38.520
Damn straight.
Now come on.

10:38.520 --> 10:40.440
I'll give you a
choice of songs -

10:40.440 --> 10:41.720
Danny Boy,

10:41.720 --> 10:44.440
The Rain In Spain,

10:44.440 --> 10:47.920
or Part-time Lover
for the Stevie Wonder
fans.

10:47.920 --> 10:50.320
I'll loan you
my dark sunglasses.

10:50.320 --> 10:52.280
Blame It
On The Bossa Nova.

10:52.280 --> 10:53.400
Ah...

10:53.400 --> 10:55.320
my favourite.

10:55.320 --> 10:56.720
A good choice.

10:56.720 --> 10:58.680
I knew you had
syncopation.

10:58.680 --> 11:00.520
Here, let's
shoot these.

11:00.520 --> 11:03.400
Oh...brings tears
to me eyes.

11:03.400 --> 11:04.840
And so do you.

11:04.840 --> 11:07.160
To mine.

11:07.160 --> 11:09.160
If that whisky
brings you tears,

11:09.160 --> 11:10.800
wait till
you hear this.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.000
Wake up.
Don't miss this.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
Don't worry. The limo
will take us home.

11:21.560 --> 11:24.360
# I was at a dance

11:24.360 --> 11:27.000
# When she caught
my eye

11:27.000 --> 11:29.640
# Standin' all alone

11:29.640 --> 11:32.200
# Lookin' sad and shy

11:32.200 --> 11:34.600
# We began to dance

11:34.600 --> 11:37.800
# Swayin' to and fro

11:37.800 --> 11:39.200
# And I knew right then

11:39.200 --> 11:42.240
# I'd never, ever
let her go

11:42.240 --> 11:44.000
# Blame it
on the bossa nova

11:44.000 --> 11:45.160
# Cha-cha-cha

11:45.160 --> 11:46.520
# And its magic spell... #

11:46.520 --> 11:47.880
How am I doing?

11:47.880 --> 11:49.640
# Blame it
on the bossa nova

11:49.640 --> 11:50.680
# Cha-cha-cha

11:50.680 --> 11:52.120
# That she knew so well... #

11:52.120 --> 11:53.480
Basso profundo.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.080
# Blame it
on the bossa nova

11:55.080 --> 11:56.360
# Cha-cha-cha

11:56.360 --> 12:00.360
# And its magic spell! #

12:00.840 --> 12:04.840
Helen!

12:08.760 --> 12:11.320
Dr Craig, this
is so good of you.

12:11.320 --> 12:14.960
Yeah, well. Let's
see if I have the facts straight.

12:14.960 --> 12:16.880
You and Yuri
were married...

12:16.880 --> 12:17.960
15 years in August.

12:17.960 --> 12:20.400
You came
to this country...?

12:20.400 --> 12:21.440
Three years ago,

12:21.440 --> 12:23.560
to visit my sister
who is sick.

12:23.560 --> 12:26.400
They will not let me
return to Russia

12:26.400 --> 12:28.240
and won't
let Yuri emigrate.

12:28.240 --> 12:29.280
Number of...?

12:29.280 --> 12:30.240
None.

12:30.240 --> 12:31.880
None.

12:31.880 --> 12:34.080
No children?

12:34.080 --> 12:35.280
That's unfortunate.

12:35.280 --> 12:37.040
Kids would
give more leverage.

12:37.040 --> 12:39.840
They want to punish us.

12:39.840 --> 12:41.760
Dr Craig,
it's three years

12:41.760 --> 12:44.160
since I have
seen my husband.

12:44.160 --> 12:47.040
A few phone calls
from him, cards...

12:47.040 --> 12:48.960
nothing else.

12:48.960 --> 12:50.880
Does he get my letters?

12:50.880 --> 12:54.240
At Christmas time,
I send packages to him.

12:54.240 --> 12:57.040
I don't know.

12:57.040 --> 12:59.480
My fault.

12:59.480 --> 13:03.480
I sign petition
on human rights.

13:05.240 --> 13:07.640
Yuri want
to stay in Russia,

13:07.640 --> 13:09.080
do his work.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.840
He blame me
for our troubles.

13:11.840 --> 13:13.880
This will be duck soup.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.760
A clear case of cruel
and unusual suffering.

13:16.760 --> 13:18.680
On humanitarian
grounds alone,

13:18.680 --> 13:21.240
they'll have
to grant a visa.

13:21.240 --> 13:23.720
I'm not looking
for credit card.

13:23.720 --> 13:27.000
I don't know
why I bother.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.200
I wonder...

13:30.200 --> 13:34.200
..does he still love me?

13:41.760 --> 13:43.880
Thanks for the tour.

13:43.880 --> 13:46.040
This place is Gothic.

13:46.040 --> 13:47.920
That's one word
for it.

13:47.920 --> 13:50.320
Life and death before
breakfast. Intense.

13:50.320 --> 13:53.240
Mind if I down
some decaf with you?

13:53.240 --> 13:54.160
Absolutely not!

13:54.160 --> 13:55.120
Absolutely not!

13:55.120 --> 13:57.040
Absolutely not!

13:57.040 --> 14:00.440
I'm looking for
a friendly face.
You have one.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.840
Hi. I'm
Victor Ehrlich.

14:01.840 --> 14:02.840
Bing Shalimar.

14:02.840 --> 14:04.240
Bing Shalimar.

14:04.240 --> 14:05.200
Don't start!

14:05.200 --> 14:07.080
Don't start!

14:07.080 --> 14:08.520
You've heard about me?

14:08.520 --> 14:09.480
No.

14:09.480 --> 14:11.560
No.

14:11.560 --> 14:11.880
No.

14:11.880 --> 14:13.320
No.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.800
You used to date?

14:14.800 --> 14:16.680
Tender, poignant, as fleeting
as a raspberry season,

14:16.680 --> 14:18.280
but so sweet.

14:18.280 --> 14:20.160
He's a
pathological liar.

14:20.160 --> 14:21.480
You're one lucky Bingle.

14:21.480 --> 14:22.880
Where did you meet?

14:22.880 --> 14:25.880
Lucy came
into my shop -
Bing's Copies.

14:25.880 --> 14:28.080
Bing's... Good colour
reproduction.

14:28.080 --> 14:29.640
The self-service machine jammed.

14:29.640 --> 14:31.840
I had to help her clear
her paper path.

14:31.840 --> 14:32.880
Ho, ho!

14:32.880 --> 14:35.760
Stop. I don't want
my private life

14:35.760 --> 14:37.160
on Radio Free Rumour(!)

14:37.160 --> 14:38.520
I'm the soul of discretion.

14:38.520 --> 14:39.840
With Joan Rivers' mouth!

14:39.840 --> 14:40.840
Ha!

14:40.840 --> 14:42.640
Ha!

14:42.640 --> 14:44.920
Laughing's
just not good for me.

14:44.920 --> 14:46.640
Here's a hilarious one.

14:46.640 --> 14:49.000
I have this
physiological problem.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.760
This will
loosen you up.

14:50.760 --> 14:51.680
Ehrlich!

14:51.680 --> 14:53.640
Ehrlich!

14:53.640 --> 14:56.480
Woman says, "I have
something to tell you.

14:56.480 --> 14:57.960
"I have acute angina."

14:57.960 --> 15:01.960
He says, "That's good,
because you have lousy legs."

15:03.800 --> 15:05.160
Oh, my God!

15:05.160 --> 15:07.040
Guess he
heard that one.

15:07.040 --> 15:11.040
Now look what you've done.
Your lousy jokes have killed him!

15:14.480 --> 15:15.640
Oh. You startled me.

15:15.640 --> 15:16.160
Oh. You startled me.

15:16.160 --> 15:17.240
Oh. You startled me.

15:17.240 --> 15:19.200
I told you to write "stat"

15:19.200 --> 15:21.240
on Mr Schwartz's
blood tests.

15:21.240 --> 15:21.760
I did.

15:21.760 --> 15:23.160
I did.

15:23.160 --> 15:26.680
Now I have to wait four hours for
results I needed in 20 minutes.

15:26.680 --> 15:28.840
What can I say? I messed up.

15:28.840 --> 15:32.480
Send Mr Schwartz to
nuclear medicine, please.

15:32.480 --> 15:33.480
OK.

15:33.480 --> 15:35.400
OK.

15:35.400 --> 15:37.680
like the lavatory
monitor,

15:37.680 --> 15:40.200
but shouldn't you
wash your hands?

15:40.200 --> 15:42.080
Oh, of course.
How stupid.

15:42.080 --> 15:46.080
You just
got me flustered.

15:51.600 --> 15:55.600
And so they would bat decapitated
heads of prisoners

15:56.000 --> 15:58.400
back and forth
across a line

15:58.400 --> 15:59.840
strung with
ladies' underwear.

15:59.840 --> 16:02.240
Such is the origin
of volleyball.

16:02.240 --> 16:06.080
The game today is
not what it used to be.

16:06.080 --> 16:07.480
Ah, hello, Donald.

16:07.480 --> 16:11.320
Just entertaining
this poor fellow shut-in.

16:11.320 --> 16:13.280
My kind of critic -
comatose.

16:13.280 --> 16:15.680
So it wasn't your singing
which brought me

16:15.680 --> 16:17.560
to my knees last night?

16:17.560 --> 16:19.000
No. Kidney stone.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.720
I felt I was passing
the Hope Diamond.

16:21.720 --> 16:23.000
Transcendental pain.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.120
But once it plopped
into the basin,
instant relief.

16:26.120 --> 16:29.080
You still
have some blood
in your urine,

16:29.080 --> 16:31.480
but your IVP looks OK and I don't
think you have any other stones.

16:31.480 --> 16:32.960
I think you can
go home tomorrow.

16:32.960 --> 16:34.040
Oh, great.

16:34.040 --> 16:35.320
Uh, I wonder...

16:35.320 --> 16:38.200
Would you sign
my copy of
Atlantis Rising?

16:38.200 --> 16:41.560
Happy to. This is
a real collector's item.

16:41.560 --> 16:43.960
Out of print,
out of mind.

16:43.960 --> 16:45.880
I'll think up
something stupendous.

16:45.880 --> 16:48.280
Atlantis Rising
came out when...

16:48.280 --> 16:49.240
'68, '69?

16:49.240 --> 16:50.200
'68, '69?

16:50.200 --> 16:51.280
'68, '69?

16:51.280 --> 16:52.720
Over 20 years ago.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.680
Won all
the major awards.

16:54.680 --> 16:55.680
Since then?

16:55.680 --> 16:58.800
Since then?

16:58.800 --> 17:01.200
what happened
to the next book?

17:01.200 --> 17:02.160
No.

17:02.160 --> 17:04.079
No.

17:04.079 --> 17:07.480
Remaindered
quicker than you
could say "B Dalton".

17:07.480 --> 17:09.359
Lousy,
to tell the truth.

17:09.359 --> 17:12.720
For the past ten years,
nothing.

17:12.720 --> 17:15.599
The muse has stopped
whispering in my ear.

17:15.599 --> 17:17.520
She finds me
bad company.

17:17.520 --> 17:19.920
Since
my daughter died,

17:19.920 --> 17:23.920
my heart does not
beat in meter.

17:25.680 --> 17:27.079
Ah, what the hell.

17:27.079 --> 17:28.920
Everybody's got
a family tragedy.

17:28.920 --> 17:30.240
Seems so, doesn't it?

17:30.240 --> 17:32.880
Yeah. It's just
a dry spell.

17:32.880 --> 17:35.280
Speaking of dry,
I'm so parched,

17:35.280 --> 17:38.120
I'd have to be
primed to spit.

17:38.120 --> 17:41.040
Do you have a bottle
in your desk?

17:41.040 --> 17:42.480
After last night,

17:42.480 --> 17:45.320
even the thought of whisky
makes me sick.

17:45.320 --> 17:47.720
And you should quit
drinking altogether,

17:47.720 --> 17:49.160
you know that?

17:49.160 --> 17:50.640
Your liver function test

17:50.640 --> 17:52.520
showed long-term
alcohol abuse.

17:52.520 --> 17:54.040
You're well on
the road to cirrhosis.

17:54.040 --> 17:56.360
If you stop,
you can recover.

17:56.360 --> 17:57.960
Well,
you're the doctor.

17:57.960 --> 17:58.920
I'm serious.

17:58.920 --> 18:00.680
I'm serious.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.080
Clear the cerebellum.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.040
I'll write a new poem...

18:04.040 --> 18:05.920
the Saga
Of St Eligius.

18:05.920 --> 18:07.880
A romance which...

18:07.880 --> 18:09.280
HEART MONITOR BEEPS

18:09.280 --> 18:13.280
What the hell is that?

18:14.080 --> 18:18.080
Code blue here,
Room 3333! Let's go!

18:19.400 --> 18:23.400
&lt; Get the crash cart
down here now, damn it!

18:29.480 --> 18:33.480
&lt; Here you go.

18:35.680 --> 18:37.600
&lt; Clear. Let's go.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.040
&lt; No. It's no good.

18:39.040 --> 18:43.040
&lt; We're not getting
a new rhythm.

18:46.680 --> 18:48.160
What's the problem?

18:48.160 --> 18:51.040
Mr Henry ate
some fugu last night.

18:51.040 --> 18:52.000
Fugu?

18:52.000 --> 18:53.080
Fugu?

18:53.080 --> 18:57.080
Ah, here it is.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.560
Mr Henry, blowfish
contains a deadly
nerve poison.

19:02.560 --> 19:05.400
And if not
prepared properly,
fugu can paralyse

19:05.400 --> 19:07.320
the central
nervous system.

19:07.320 --> 19:08.760
Right. I know.

19:08.760 --> 19:09.720
What?

19:09.720 --> 19:11.640
What?

19:11.640 --> 19:13.080
that only serves fugu -

19:13.080 --> 19:14.520
57 varieties.

19:14.520 --> 19:17.960
You deliberately went out of
your way to eat something you
knew could kill you?

19:17.960 --> 19:20.200
That's the point.
Fugu's macho.

19:20.200 --> 19:23.240
It's all the rage
in Japan right now.

19:23.240 --> 19:26.120
Every time you strap on
the feed bag, you've got a
one in 200 chance

19:26.120 --> 19:27.640
of winding up in an iron lung.

19:27.640 --> 19:30.840
Seems like a dumb way to die,
killed by a hunk of fish.

19:30.840 --> 19:32.240
That's why I'm here.

19:32.240 --> 19:34.160
The first bite
was exhilarating,

19:34.160 --> 19:35.600
but after dinner,

19:35.600 --> 19:38.440
I kind of cooled out
on the concept.

19:38.440 --> 19:42.440
I've been up all night
in a cold sweat.

19:44.680 --> 19:47.720
You heart rate is
a little accelerated.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.160
Is that bad?

19:49.160 --> 19:50.440
Your adrenaline's up.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.200
Because of the poison?

19:52.200 --> 19:54.760
From the thrill
of fine dining.

19:54.760 --> 19:57.640
I get the same reaction
when they hand me the cheque.

19:57.640 --> 20:00.520
Any tingling
in your hands or feet?

20:00.520 --> 20:01.760
No. Zero tingle.

20:01.760 --> 20:04.840
Then I think
you'll survive
your culinary adventure.

20:04.840 --> 20:06.760
Whew!

20:06.760 --> 20:08.200
Ah-choo!

20:08.200 --> 20:09.320
Bless you.

20:09.320 --> 20:12.040
Hope I'm not coming
down with something.

20:12.040 --> 20:14.320
Fugu, pally-boy.

20:14.320 --> 20:17.280
Helen, will you have a word with
Julie McPhail.

20:17.280 --> 20:19.680
I told her to send Al Schwartz
to nuclear medicine

20:19.680 --> 20:21.120
and she took him
to radiology instead.

20:21.120 --> 20:24.080
It's the second time today
she's put me behind the eight ball.

20:24.080 --> 20:26.440
She's been under
the weather recently.

20:26.440 --> 20:27.840
I'll talk to her

20:27.840 --> 20:30.720
after I give
Mrs Luna her enema.

20:30.720 --> 20:34.080
Enemas...all part
of life's rich pageant.

20:34.080 --> 20:36.400
Oh, shut up.

20:36.400 --> 20:39.040
Welcome back, Bingo.

20:39.040 --> 20:40.960
Let's do a magnetic
resonance scan.

20:40.960 --> 20:43.040
Don't bother.
I'm a narcoleptic.

20:43.040 --> 20:45.640
I didn't want
to tell you.

20:45.640 --> 20:47.040
I thought narcolepsy

20:47.040 --> 20:49.240
was an uncontrollable
urge to fall asleep.

20:49.240 --> 20:51.640
Only when I'm
bored or anxious.

20:51.640 --> 20:54.520
Whenever I get
over-stimulated,
I have attacks.

20:54.520 --> 20:57.520
I lose
muscle control
for a few minutes.

20:57.520 --> 21:00.400
Excitement
of any kind makes
me cataplectic.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.400
Let's do the scan
anyway.

21:02.400 --> 21:04.800
I have to maintain
an even keel,

21:04.800 --> 21:06.240
no highs or lows,

21:06.240 --> 21:07.640
otherwise I'm Jell-O.

21:07.640 --> 21:10.240
Anger...fear...

21:10.240 --> 21:13.000
laughter...sex.

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
You lose muscle control
during sex?

21:17.280 --> 21:19.120
Paralysed for
a few minutes,

21:19.120 --> 21:21.120
but I see and hear.

21:21.120 --> 21:23.120
Lucky you
found out now,

21:23.120 --> 21:25.800
instead of before
the big topper.

21:25.800 --> 21:28.720
Lucy, I have an idea that will
help you understand me better.

21:28.720 --> 21:31.200
Come to
my support group.

21:31.200 --> 21:33.520
Oh, Bing...

21:33.520 --> 21:35.400
I work in a hospital.

21:35.400 --> 21:38.320
I keep medical problems
out of my social life.

21:38.320 --> 21:41.200
That's why
she dumped me.

21:41.200 --> 21:44.040
Don't do that.

21:44.040 --> 21:46.000
I'll come
to your meeting.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.400
I'll pretend
you didn't say yes

21:48.400 --> 21:50.240
so I don't get
over-stimulated.

21:50.240 --> 21:53.600
Heard the one
about the fellow
of ethnic persuasion

21:53.600 --> 21:56.040
that locked his keys
in the car?

21:56.040 --> 22:00.040
Took three hours
to get his family out.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.280
Why did
you do that?

22:02.280 --> 22:05.160
I needed to be
alone with you.

22:05.160 --> 22:06.600
Scan him, Dano.
How can you go out with him?

22:06.600 --> 22:08.000
Scan him, Dano.
How can you go out with him?

22:08.000 --> 22:09.480
Lift-off.

22:09.480 --> 22:10.920
The answer is no, Victor.

22:10.920 --> 22:12.360
Turn it off, Dano.

22:12.360 --> 22:13.800
I won't go out with you.

22:13.800 --> 22:16.360
What do I care? I've got
a hot date. On.

22:16.360 --> 22:17.400
Who?

22:17.400 --> 22:19.200
You don't know here.
A new haematologist.

22:19.200 --> 22:21.160
We're going to the Pita Pocket
to suck up some hummus.

22:21.160 --> 22:23.640
Well, I'm so happy for you.
Bring him out!

22:23.640 --> 22:25.920
What do you care. You've got Bing,
the sleeping beauty.

22:25.920 --> 22:28.400
Have fun at the narcolepsy
support meetings.

22:28.400 --> 22:32.400
Just be careful you don't
turn him off...or ON!

22:36.280 --> 22:38.400
Oh!

22:38.400 --> 22:42.400
Bing, baby,
you're going my way.

22:46.080 --> 22:50.080
Your interest in the Peltrovich
situation is a welcome surprise.

22:50.400 --> 22:52.200
As I said in my many letters
and repeated phone calls,

22:52.200 --> 22:56.200
his situation was
brought to my attention

22:56.440 --> 22:58.000
by his wife, Masha.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.920
What's
your real interest

22:59.920 --> 23:01.960
in Yuri Peltrovich,
Dr Craig?

23:01.960 --> 23:03.760
Purely humanitarian.

23:03.760 --> 23:06.760
To reunite the good doctor
with his wife.

23:06.760 --> 23:10.360
Yet you're offering him
a position on your staff?

23:10.360 --> 23:12.400
Dr Craig's
offer of employment

23:12.400 --> 23:14.760
helps the application
on this end.

23:14.760 --> 23:17.200
I thought I'd
take a chance.

23:17.200 --> 23:20.680
A long shot, I realise.
Soviet medicine
being what it is.

23:20.680 --> 23:24.680
What's that, Dr Craig,
in your opinion?

23:24.720 --> 23:25.760
Primitive.

23:25.760 --> 23:27.240
Let's face it.

23:27.240 --> 23:28.720
You people are
30 years behind

23:28.720 --> 23:31.080
in research, equipment,
pharmaceuticals.

23:31.080 --> 23:33.960
I'll have my hands full just
bringing this guy up to date.

23:33.960 --> 23:37.320
You haven't let him
practice surgery
for two years.

23:37.320 --> 23:41.320
For crying out loud, he's been
putting distributor caps
into tractors.

23:42.120 --> 23:46.120
I'm so glad we see
eye to eye, Dr Craig.

23:47.480 --> 23:51.480
Great.
When does he leave?

23:52.200 --> 23:54.440
Since Dr Peltrovich
is so incompetent

23:54.440 --> 23:57.320
and Soviet medicine
so primitive, as you say,

23:57.320 --> 24:00.160
we'll spare you
the trouble and expense

24:00.160 --> 24:02.120
of rehabilitating
this former surgeon.

24:02.120 --> 24:04.680
I'll recommend
to my government

24:04.680 --> 24:08.320
that we deny this
emigration application.

24:08.320 --> 24:12.320
Good day.

24:13.120 --> 24:17.120
Are you always
this much help?

24:18.040 --> 24:20.960
For the love of God, Helen.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.400
Brendan,
what's the matter?

24:22.400 --> 24:24.960
My roommate
gave up the ghost
this afternoon.

24:24.960 --> 24:27.320
I hope it wasn't
too distressing.

24:27.320 --> 24:30.560
Not at all, buzzers, chaos,
and the pure
smell of death -

24:30.560 --> 24:32.120
a day at the beach.

24:32.120 --> 24:33.120
Are you OK?

24:33.120 --> 24:37.120
Are you OK?

24:37.400 --> 24:38.920
He's still in there?

24:38.920 --> 24:41.320
That's right.
Read my ruby lips.

24:41.320 --> 24:43.960
I'm cellmates
with a corpse.

24:43.960 --> 24:47.800
I hear him
bubbling and sighing
in the next bed.

24:47.800 --> 24:49.720
Rotting
like a rump roast.

24:49.720 --> 24:53.120
The order for the morgue
must have gotten misplaced.

24:53.120 --> 24:56.480
I'll have them take
care of it right away.

24:56.480 --> 24:59.160
All right. Come on.

24:59.160 --> 25:00.600
Get back into bed.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.520
I'm so sorry about this.

25:02.520 --> 25:05.880
OK.

25:05.880 --> 25:08.720
You know, now that
you're here,

25:08.720 --> 25:12.720
I find the presence
of death hugely erotic.

25:14.040 --> 25:16.440
Come on, fair
and luscious Helen.

25:16.440 --> 25:18.200
Join me
in a connubial cuddle.

25:18.200 --> 25:20.120
No, thanks.

25:20.120 --> 25:21.240
Oh, please?

25:21.240 --> 25:22.520
You've been drinking.

25:22.520 --> 25:23.920
Steadily.

25:23.920 --> 25:26.840
Since
the angel of death
fluttered her wings.

25:26.840 --> 25:28.720
You'd never know,
would you?

25:28.720 --> 25:30.160
I'm proud of that.

25:30.160 --> 25:32.560
Give me a fifth of whisky
and a thermos of black coffee

25:32.560 --> 25:36.560
and I could
pilot a plane
over the North Pole.

25:37.360 --> 25:39.480
It's true.

25:39.480 --> 25:43.440
Tomorrow
the Chinese acrobats
will do stunts

25:43.440 --> 25:45.320
Bruce Lee
never dreamed of.

25:45.320 --> 25:48.240
I'm going to go home,
get some rest,

25:48.240 --> 25:50.640
grab a fast cab to Logan
in the morning,

25:50.640 --> 25:53.040
and be in NYC
by noon.

25:53.040 --> 25:55.440
What did I do with
my wallet?

25:55.440 --> 25:56.880
New York, New York.

25:56.880 --> 25:59.280
So nice, they
named it twice.

25:59.280 --> 26:01.440
Wexler's due here
any minute.

26:01.440 --> 26:04.880
Ah-choo!

26:04.880 --> 26:06.920
That's not
what you think.

26:06.920 --> 26:07.920
A cold?

26:07.920 --> 26:11.600
A cold?

26:11.600 --> 26:14.440
I hope I haven't
lost my wallet.

26:14.440 --> 26:16.360
We've got some
DOAs outside.

26:16.360 --> 26:18.760
I hope it's quick.
What happened?

26:18.760 --> 26:21.000
A couple got swacked
by Amtrak.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.760
The train totalled
their Toyota.

26:22.760 --> 26:25.080
We flossed them out
with tongs.

26:25.080 --> 26:28.040
How does anybody
get hit by a train?

26:28.040 --> 26:29.800
You can see them coming.

26:29.800 --> 26:32.200
Happens more often
than you think.

26:32.200 --> 26:35.240
They played chicken
with the choo-choo
and lost.

26:35.240 --> 26:36.680
Luther, man the phones.

26:36.680 --> 26:38.120
Ah-choo!

26:38.120 --> 26:40.520
Bring body bags
and a spatula.

26:40.520 --> 26:41.960
I'm not
catching a cold.

26:41.960 --> 26:43.400
I'm not
catching a cold.

26:43.400 --> 26:45.160
I'm not
catching a cold.

26:45.160 --> 26:48.000
PHONE RINGS

26:48.000 --> 26:51.360
St Eligius ER.

26:51.360 --> 26:55.360
Yeah. Oh, hi.

26:55.520 --> 26:59.520
OK. I'll tell him.

27:00.480 --> 27:03.040
I believe that's it.

27:03.040 --> 27:06.160
I'm done. Wexler
can deal with this.

27:06.160 --> 27:08.640
Wexler called.
Threw his back out.

27:08.640 --> 27:10.120
Nobody
to cover for him.

27:10.120 --> 27:11.520
What?

27:11.520 --> 27:12.600
There's nobody.

27:12.600 --> 27:14.880
No, no, no, no!

27:14.880 --> 27:16.800
I can't
find my wallet!

27:16.800 --> 27:18.240
I'm stuck here!

27:18.240 --> 27:22.040
I'll never have
another weekend off
the rest of my life!

27:22.040 --> 27:24.360
And yes,
I have a cold!

27:24.360 --> 27:25.560
(HICCUP)

27:25.560 --> 27:29.560
I also caught
Mrs Nova's hiccups!

27:32.120 --> 27:33.720
Narcolepsy ruins lives.

27:33.720 --> 27:36.600
We sufferers know
how it prevents us

27:36.600 --> 27:38.040
from practicing
our professions,

27:38.040 --> 27:39.960
break up our marriages,

27:39.960 --> 27:43.320
make a normal
social life impossible.

27:43.320 --> 27:47.320
Popular stereotypes
reinforce the idea

27:47.800 --> 27:51.520
that falling asleep against
one's will is comical...

27:51.520 --> 27:54.800
Big guy, I apologise for telling
that second joke.

27:54.800 --> 27:58.160
I shouldn't have laughed.
It wasn't funny.

27:58.160 --> 28:00.120
Where's Lucy?

28:00.120 --> 28:02.960
Didn't show.
I'm trying not
to get upset.

28:02.960 --> 28:06.960
Bing, would you
start this evening?

28:10.360 --> 28:12.680
I had a pretty
good week.

28:12.680 --> 28:15.520
Avoided driving,
took public transportation.

28:15.520 --> 28:19.360
Fell asleep once
in the check-out line
at Filene's.

28:19.360 --> 28:21.800
Fortunately I didn't
drop my packages.

28:21.800 --> 28:25.120
I met a woman who works as
a nurse at St Eligius.

28:25.120 --> 28:27.160
I invited her to come tonight

28:27.160 --> 28:30.760
but she didn't.

28:30.760 --> 28:33.760
A friend of hers
came instead.

28:33.760 --> 28:37.040
Dr Victor Ehrlich.

28:37.040 --> 28:40.720
Would Dr Ehrlich
care to give

28:40.720 --> 28:42.480
a physician's
point of view?

28:42.480 --> 28:45.080
No. I'm just observing
tonight, thanks.

28:45.080 --> 28:48.000
Perhaps Dr Ehrlich
can address the issue

28:48.000 --> 28:49.880
of why
the medical profession

28:49.880 --> 28:51.840
has made
so little progress

28:51.840 --> 28:54.640
in understanding and treating
the tragedy of narcolepsy?

28:54.640 --> 28:56.160
No, thank you.

28:56.160 --> 28:59.400
Please, Victor.

28:59.400 --> 29:03.320
OK. I'll give it
a try.

29:03.320 --> 29:05.240
You know,
every afflicted group

29:05.240 --> 29:07.640
feels the same way
you do -

29:07.640 --> 29:11.000
"Not enough being done,
why isn't there a cure?"

29:11.000 --> 29:13.400
People expect miracles
these days.

29:13.400 --> 29:17.400
Despite all the advances
of modern medicine...

29:18.200 --> 29:22.040
..what we know is less
than what we don't know.

29:22.040 --> 29:25.400
Many, many
mysteries remain.

29:25.400 --> 29:27.440
And, uh...every
afflicted group

29:27.440 --> 29:28.920
feels the same way that you do.

29:28.920 --> 29:30.840
Did I say that already?

29:30.840 --> 29:32.440
I did, didn't I?

29:32.440 --> 29:36.440
Um...

29:39.280 --> 29:42.000
Dr Craig,
what happened?

29:42.000 --> 29:43.440
Things look good.

29:43.440 --> 29:45.040
(SPEAKS RUSSIAN)

29:45.040 --> 29:46.960
Spare me, please.
Where's Ellen?

29:46.960 --> 29:48.400
Dining room.

29:48.400 --> 29:49.720
Here.

29:49.720 --> 29:51.440
BABY CRIES

29:51.440 --> 29:52.880
I'll check
on Barbara.

29:52.880 --> 29:55.280
Mark, how did
the meeting go?

29:55.280 --> 29:57.040
Very promising
developments.

29:57.040 --> 29:58.160
Wonderful.

29:58.160 --> 29:59.760
Look here.

29:59.760 --> 30:02.960
My Cushing Left Anterior
Descending Artery Award.

30:02.960 --> 30:06.600
The police found it
in a Buffalo pawn shop.

30:06.600 --> 30:09.480
They're hot on the trail
of John Doe.

30:09.480 --> 30:11.400
They beeped me
on the way home.

30:11.400 --> 30:13.880
Mark, what was
the Soviet response?

30:13.880 --> 30:17.160
Extremely promising
overall.

30:17.160 --> 30:20.040
I did make
a minor faux pas

30:20.040 --> 30:21.360
about Soviet
medicine, but, uh...

30:21.360 --> 30:22.160
What did you say?

30:22.160 --> 30:23.440
What did you say?

30:23.440 --> 30:25.240
You botched it,
didn't you?

30:25.240 --> 30:27.360
I did not
botch anything.

30:27.360 --> 30:30.600
Mark, we're talking about
two people's lives.

30:30.600 --> 30:33.800
Their futures,
their happiness,
their freedom.

30:33.800 --> 30:37.320
What you think
about Soviet medicine
is immaterial.

30:37.320 --> 30:39.840
Your opinion's
not important.
No-one cares.

30:39.840 --> 30:42.720
I put my professional
reputation on the line

30:42.720 --> 30:45.920
to sponsor Yuri Peltrovich
for St Eligius' staff.

30:45.920 --> 30:49.760
If it doesn't pan out,
I'm the goat.

30:49.760 --> 30:53.760
How did this situation
become all about you?

30:54.240 --> 30:56.040
OK.

30:56.040 --> 30:58.880
You tell Masha
you've ruined her life.

30:58.880 --> 31:02.640
I can't do it.

31:02.640 --> 31:04.840
Father Westphall!

31:04.840 --> 31:07.840
Come to succour
the fallen angel.

31:07.840 --> 31:09.240
What the hell do
you think you're doing?

31:09.240 --> 31:11.800
I'm balancing
my electrolytes.

31:11.800 --> 31:12.920
You're killing yourself
with the booze.

31:12.920 --> 31:15.400
You're killing yourself
with the booze.

31:15.400 --> 31:17.120
I know all about you.

31:17.120 --> 31:19.480
Bona fide bleeding
martyr that you are,

31:19.480 --> 31:22.400
carrying the burdens
of the weeping world

31:22.400 --> 31:23.840
upon your shoulders.

31:23.840 --> 31:26.680
St Donald.
Fresh stigmata daily.

31:26.680 --> 31:29.600
Your dry-cleaning bills
must be astronomical.

31:29.600 --> 31:30.840
It's the whisky talking.

31:30.840 --> 31:33.880
Everybody feels sorry.
Well, not me.

31:33.880 --> 31:37.120
Your suffering is bogus,
boring, and bilious.

31:37.120 --> 31:39.480
We'll talk about it
when you're sober, all right?

31:39.480 --> 31:41.240
What have you and I
possibly got to chat about?

31:41.240 --> 31:44.160
Maybe about the way you're
flushing your talent
down the toilet with the booze?

31:44.160 --> 31:47.000
You're a poor excuse
for a real man.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.320
You're just the Dean of
Students, not a doctor.

31:50.320 --> 31:53.000
I won't take abuse
from a foul-mouthed drunk.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.520
I'll be the judge
of that.

31:55.520 --> 31:58.360
Helen, am I
a foul-mouthed drunk?

31:58.360 --> 32:01.720
I'll thank you to keep
your hands to myself.

32:01.720 --> 32:05.560
Don't go. Let Donald crawl
to his bed of nails.

32:05.560 --> 32:07.920
I'll show you
a darling time.

32:07.920 --> 32:08.920
Let go of me now.

32:08.920 --> 32:10.880
Let go of me now.

32:10.880 --> 32:14.720
Ah...now I'm getting
through to you.

32:14.720 --> 32:17.520
A little spirit,
a little moxie.

32:17.520 --> 32:19.000
All right, let's go.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.840
You renal failure,
come on.

32:22.840 --> 32:25.240
Let's see what
you're made of.

32:25.240 --> 32:29.240
Back off.

32:35.480 --> 32:39.480
Here you are.

32:39.800 --> 32:43.520
That's real blood.

32:43.520 --> 32:47.520
I'm going to be sick.

32:56.080 --> 33:00.080
DOORBELL RINGS

33:00.640 --> 33:04.640
Ehrlich, it's 9:00 AM.
Sunday morning.

33:04.680 --> 33:07.480
How come you told me you
were going to the meeting and
then you didn't showup?

33:07.480 --> 33:09.880
I called Bing's machine
and explained.

33:09.880 --> 33:12.760
He's a nice guy.
I just can't get involved.

33:12.760 --> 33:14.680
Anyway, I thought
you had a hot date.

33:14.680 --> 33:17.000
What happened
to the Pita Pocket?

33:17.000 --> 33:20.680
She told me
to get stuffed.

33:20.680 --> 33:22.960
Lie. There was
no hot date.

33:22.960 --> 33:25.720
I just said that
to get at you.

33:25.720 --> 33:26.800
You did.

33:26.800 --> 33:27.800
Did what?

33:27.800 --> 33:29.640
Did what?

33:29.640 --> 33:31.160
I was steamed.

33:31.160 --> 33:34.320
No kidding?
How about getting
under your covers?

33:34.320 --> 33:36.560
You've got some
nerve, you know?

33:36.560 --> 33:38.000
I'm a desperate man.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.280
Are you going to ask me in?

33:41.280 --> 33:44.160
Well...

33:44.160 --> 33:46.960
that could go
either way.

33:46.960 --> 33:50.320
Thanks for
the lunch loan.

33:50.320 --> 33:52.680
You're a cheap date.
Broth... Yeugh!

33:52.680 --> 33:55.120
It clears up my sinuses.

33:55.120 --> 33:57.960
I have to call in all
my lost credit cards.

33:57.960 --> 33:59.520
You have
credit cards?

33:59.520 --> 34:00.960
Sears.

34:00.960 --> 34:03.640
That's tough to get.

34:03.640 --> 34:05.080
Oh, just my luck.

34:05.080 --> 34:06.560
I've come down with a cold.

34:06.560 --> 34:09.360
Luck is the residue
of your own design.

34:09.360 --> 34:10.360
Meaning?

34:10.360 --> 34:11.760
Meaning?

34:11.760 --> 34:13.920
I don't believe
in vitamin C.

34:13.920 --> 34:16.080
I don't believe
in luck.

34:16.080 --> 34:19.400
I do. People are either born
under the right stars or not.

34:19.400 --> 34:20.560
There's nothing
you can do about it.

34:20.560 --> 34:22.840
Jackie, the world's
a dangerous place.

34:22.840 --> 34:24.679
It's not
because of stars.

34:24.679 --> 34:27.960
It's because of hatred
and poverty, human
irrationality, handguns.

34:27.960 --> 34:29.840
Look what happened
to Wayne.

34:29.840 --> 34:32.159
Exactly. Getting
shot by a stranger

34:32.159 --> 34:34.000
who's aiming
at someone else.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.360
That's bad karma.

34:35.360 --> 34:36.719
Not at all. ER's a risky gig.

34:36.719 --> 34:39.360
If Wayne wanted to play it
safe, he would have
chosen paediatrics.

34:39.360 --> 34:41.880
You're saying he
asked to be killed?

34:41.880 --> 34:44.639
No, but people
who chalk up
everything to fate

34:44.639 --> 34:46.520
just don't want to accept
responsibility for their own lives.

34:46.520 --> 34:49.639
You're a fine one
to talk about
responsibility.

34:49.639 --> 34:52.440
It's a good thing I didn't go to New
York. I could have gotten mugged.

34:52.440 --> 34:53.719
Elliot,

34:53.719 --> 34:55.120
stay out of this.

34:55.120 --> 34:56.560
Gee, I'm sorry.

34:56.560 --> 35:00.560
I thought we were
talking about me.

35:07.360 --> 35:10.480
Hi, Helen. What gives?

35:10.480 --> 35:14.480
Let's have a cup
of coffee, shall we?

35:16.120 --> 35:17.520
How are you?

35:17.520 --> 35:19.880
Tired. Nothing unusual.

35:19.880 --> 35:22.880
I've been going over
the narcotics records.

35:22.880 --> 35:25.000
Yeah?

35:25.000 --> 35:26.880
You have half a dozen

35:26.880 --> 35:28.200
unwitnessed
Demerol discards

35:28.200 --> 35:30.440
in the last two weeks.

35:30.440 --> 35:33.760
Helen, you know what
this place is like.

35:33.760 --> 35:36.520
Short staff.
There's never anybody
around to witness.

35:36.520 --> 35:39.760
You want me to pull
somebody off a code?

35:39.760 --> 35:42.560
Julie, I'm going
to ask you something,

35:42.560 --> 35:46.560
and I want you to be
straight with me.

35:47.720 --> 35:49.480
Mr Thomas
is having pain

35:49.480 --> 35:51.440
because you're
skimming his drugs.

35:51.440 --> 35:53.080
What are you talking about?

35:53.080 --> 35:54.480
Chronic sniffles,
puffy hands,

35:54.480 --> 35:56.800
constant trips
to the ladies' room.

35:56.800 --> 36:00.520
Your performance
is erratic,
deteriorating.

36:00.520 --> 36:02.080
You're using,
aren't you?

36:02.080 --> 36:04.360
That is absolutely
not true.

36:04.360 --> 36:05.520
I'd like to believe that.

36:05.520 --> 36:06.760
You should!

36:06.760 --> 36:09.520
If I tell
Dr Auschlander,
he'll test you.

36:09.520 --> 36:11.560
I thought you were
against testing.

36:11.560 --> 36:13.400
Julie,
you need help.

36:13.400 --> 36:15.520
I've just been depressed.

36:15.520 --> 36:16.960
The past few years

36:16.960 --> 36:19.680
I've had all kinds
of physical problems.

36:19.680 --> 36:23.400
Look, my mom took DES
when she was carrying me.

36:23.400 --> 36:26.160
I had to have a hysterectomy
when I was 23.

36:26.160 --> 36:29.400
It tends to cloud your
feelings about the future.

36:29.400 --> 36:31.000
I'm not strung out!

36:31.000 --> 36:32.760
I'm concerned
about your patients.

36:32.760 --> 36:35.360
You can't give quality
care if you're using.

36:35.360 --> 36:39.360
Helen, I'm not!

36:39.800 --> 36:43.800
I have a responsibility
to report this.

36:43.880 --> 36:45.960
Push me, I'll quit.

36:45.960 --> 36:49.960
I can get a job at
any hospital in the city.

36:50.160 --> 36:53.240
So just go to hell.

36:53.240 --> 36:56.120
Do you see anything in my eye?

36:56.120 --> 36:58.760
There's a tiny
fleck of metal
floating around.

36:58.760 --> 37:01.560
I was at
a Twisted Sister concert.

37:01.560 --> 37:02.960
Into heavy metal, huh?

37:02.960 --> 37:06.960
No. Just into heavy.

37:07.640 --> 37:11.320
Blink. It's right on
the edge of your lid.

37:11.320 --> 37:13.000
There. I got it.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.880
It's left
a little scratch,

37:14.880 --> 37:17.560
but I'll prescribe some
antiseptic eye drops.

37:17.560 --> 37:18.800
Dr Axelrod.

37:18.800 --> 37:20.160
Leave me alone.

37:20.160 --> 37:22.480
I've had the worst
weekend of my life.

37:22.480 --> 37:25.280
Whatever's gone wrong now,
I don't want to know.

37:25.280 --> 37:26.720
But I...

37:26.720 --> 37:28.960
Luther, remember how
they used to kill

37:28.960 --> 37:30.360
the bearer of bad news?

37:30.360 --> 37:32.080
How's your cold?

37:32.080 --> 37:33.440
Like cream of phlegm.

37:33.440 --> 37:34.760
Find your wallet?

37:34.760 --> 37:37.160
Some sucker's
on a shopping spree.

37:37.160 --> 37:39.360
Guess what?

37:39.360 --> 37:41.240
Where did you get that?

37:41.240 --> 37:42.560
Lost and found.

37:42.560 --> 37:44.400
A security guard
found it.

37:44.400 --> 37:48.400
Money's gone, Chinese
acrobat tickets gone.

37:48.560 --> 37:50.280
Sears card's still here.

37:50.280 --> 37:51.400
Thanks.

37:51.400 --> 37:53.160
You're welcome.

37:53.160 --> 37:54.600
Chinese acrobats?

37:54.600 --> 37:56.680
Yeah. They're fantastic.
They're my heroes.

37:56.680 --> 37:58.080
Mine, too.

37:58.080 --> 38:00.920
I've seen them
three times.

38:00.920 --> 38:02.840
My name's
Ann van Duren.

38:02.840 --> 38:05.720
Oh, uh...
I'm Elliot Axelrod.

38:05.720 --> 38:07.440
Well, listen,
Elliot, um...

38:07.440 --> 38:10.680
when you're finished here, would you
like to go for kung pao chicken?

38:10.680 --> 38:13.720
Talk about
triple somersaults
and the human pyramid?

38:13.720 --> 38:15.640
I'd love to, but, um...

38:15.640 --> 38:17.280
I don't think so.

38:17.280 --> 38:18.520
Oh, why not?

38:18.520 --> 38:21.240
To be honest, I'm
a walking misfortune -

38:21.240 --> 38:22.360
fate's stooge.

38:22.360 --> 38:25.120
Everything in my life
goes wrong.

38:25.120 --> 38:29.120
Elliot, maybe
your luck has changed.

38:29.920 --> 38:30.960
KNOCKING

38:30.960 --> 38:33.360
KNOCKING

38:33.360 --> 38:35.240
I just checked
on Brendan.

38:35.240 --> 38:37.560
He could charm
birds from trees.

38:37.560 --> 38:38.960
He sent you this.

38:38.960 --> 38:40.480
Thanks. How is he?

38:40.480 --> 38:41.880
Hung over and thirsty,

38:41.880 --> 38:43.720
threatening to drink
his after-shave.

38:43.720 --> 38:45.200
A joke, I think.

38:45.200 --> 38:46.600
What a waste.

38:46.600 --> 38:49.800
He really got to me,
pushed all my buttons.

38:49.800 --> 38:51.640
I wanted to break loose,

38:51.640 --> 38:54.000
let it all fly,
lose myself.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.400
But in this job,

38:55.400 --> 38:57.680
I'm supposed to be at room
temperature all the time.

38:57.680 --> 39:00.440
You sang Blame It
On The Bossa Nova in public

39:00.440 --> 39:01.840
and you punched him.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.840
That's not
exactly lukewarm.

39:03.840 --> 39:06.680
He thinks I'm grey
and dull. He's right.

39:06.680 --> 39:09.000
Passion scares me
for some reason.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.760
Maybe that's why Carol and I...

39:10.760 --> 39:13.120
Donald, you're too old
for a midlife crisis.

39:13.120 --> 39:15.520
Why? You and everybody in this
hospital has a perception of me

39:15.520 --> 39:17.800
that I'm supposed to
live up to.

39:17.800 --> 39:20.560
I'm as trapped in my
image as Connolly is in his.

39:20.560 --> 39:24.560
Surprise us.

39:38.800 --> 39:42.800
"To Donald Westphall,
song stylist."

39:46.360 --> 39:48.360
I shouldn't have
come to America.

39:48.360 --> 39:51.160
I ruin everything.

39:51.160 --> 39:53.480
We have good life
in Moscow.

39:53.480 --> 39:54.520
Here he is.

39:54.520 --> 39:55.560
Mrs Craig.

39:55.560 --> 39:58.520
Now just stay calm.

39:58.520 --> 40:01.320
Chasing Molokov
all day.

40:01.320 --> 40:02.960
OK, it's settled.

40:02.960 --> 40:05.920
Yuri Peltrovich
will be here next week.

40:05.920 --> 40:07.360
Is it really true?

40:07.360 --> 40:08.560
The wheels are turning.

40:08.560 --> 40:09.520
Thank God.

40:09.520 --> 40:12.160
Thank God.

40:12.160 --> 40:13.960
until you find a place.

40:13.960 --> 40:16.320
Please, as long
as you like.

40:16.320 --> 40:18.960
Dr Craig, how
can we thank you?

40:18.960 --> 40:20.480
In English.

40:20.480 --> 40:22.080
I'm proud
of you, Mark.

40:22.080 --> 40:24.880
Yeah. Masha, would you
go check Barbara, please?

40:24.880 --> 40:25.960
Da, da.

40:25.960 --> 40:28.280
Thank you again
many thousand times

40:28.280 --> 40:29.480
from my heart.

40:29.480 --> 40:31.120
Yep, yep.

40:31.120 --> 40:33.960
Oh, Mark, how
did you do it?

40:33.960 --> 40:35.280
Tell me.

40:35.280 --> 40:36.760
Diplomacy,
pure and simple.

40:36.760 --> 40:38.480
Nothing to do with me.

40:38.480 --> 40:40.880
Molokov is a third-level
paper pusher

40:40.880 --> 40:44.560
with absolutely no authority
to nix the application.

40:44.560 --> 40:48.400
Turns out that Reagan
just sold Gorbachev
some soybean futures,

40:48.400 --> 40:51.240
and Peltrovich
was part of the deal.

40:51.240 --> 40:54.920
They were ready
to let Yuri go all along.

40:54.920 --> 40:56.680
I almost blew it.

40:56.680 --> 40:58.840
Well, no harm done.

40:58.840 --> 41:01.080
So much
for Craig's clout.

41:01.080 --> 41:03.400
Oh, thank you
for trying, Mark,

41:03.400 --> 41:06.480
and for offering Yuri and Masha
a place to stay.

41:06.480 --> 41:07.880
Yeah, well...

41:07.880 --> 41:11.880
welcome to Ellis Island.

41:12.800 --> 41:15.600
It registered off the
Richter scale for me.

41:15.600 --> 41:19.400
Too, too good.

41:19.400 --> 41:21.640
Aah!

41:21.640 --> 41:23.600
How will I explain
these bruises?

41:23.600 --> 41:26.360
Why do you always
hit me after sex?

41:26.360 --> 41:27.640
You're so kinky.

41:27.640 --> 41:31.440
I can't stand
feeling this good!

41:31.440 --> 41:32.560
Oh!

41:32.560 --> 41:34.640
Hey!

41:34.640 --> 41:38.640
What are you, nuts?

41:41.560 --> 41:44.560
Donald,
me sparring partner,

41:44.560 --> 41:45.960
me blood brother.

41:45.960 --> 41:47.880
How my heart leaps up
to see you.

41:47.880 --> 41:50.560
Push back the furniture and we'll
wrestle naked in front of the fire.

41:50.560 --> 41:53.160
I want to thank you
for the inscription.

41:53.160 --> 41:54.400
My pleasure.

41:54.400 --> 41:56.200
And I also want to apologise.

41:56.200 --> 41:57.720
Think nothing of it.

41:57.720 --> 41:59.600
No. I lost my temper.

41:59.600 --> 42:02.440
To hit a patient,
that's unforgivable.

42:02.440 --> 42:04.520
Forgiven and forgotten.

42:04.520 --> 42:07.560
Brendan, um...

42:07.560 --> 42:10.280
..don't you sense
a need for a change?

42:10.280 --> 42:13.040
You have a problem.
You're an alcoholic.

42:13.040 --> 42:14.400
You have to stop drinking now.

42:14.400 --> 42:15.760
You're the doctor.

42:15.760 --> 42:19.000
I can arrange to have you entered
into a detox programme.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.200
Sounds just the thing.

42:20.200 --> 42:22.520
Trying that, it'll
put me back in the pink.

42:22.520 --> 42:25.520
Lucid, prolific.

42:25.520 --> 42:28.360
Why don't I believe
you'll follow my advice?

42:28.360 --> 42:30.400
Because
I'm a free spirit.

42:30.400 --> 42:31.800
I'll tell you what.

42:31.800 --> 42:35.080
Why don't you join
me down in O'Quinn's

42:35.080 --> 42:36.520
when I'm
convalesced.

42:36.520 --> 42:39.440
We'll knock back
a couple of
celebratory shots.

42:39.440 --> 42:41.480
You haven't
heard a word.

42:41.480 --> 42:43.960
We could be
great best friends.

42:43.960 --> 42:46.840
No, I don't
think so, Brendan.

42:46.840 --> 42:49.240
You see,
for whatever it's worth,

42:49.240 --> 42:52.960
I've devoted myself
to maintaining life,

42:52.960 --> 42:55.640
and you're dedicated
to destroying yours.

42:55.640 --> 42:58.680
Sorry, but far from
being a free spirit,

42:58.680 --> 43:01.000
your life seems
out of control.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.720
Alcohol has made you
this desperate,
pathetic little man

43:03.720 --> 43:06.520
hiding behind
all this bravura talk.

43:06.520 --> 43:08.360
You're playing
the drunken poet,

43:08.360 --> 43:11.600
and it's killing you.

43:11.600 --> 43:15.000
Well, I'll
keep that in mind.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.600
Thanks for the advice.

43:16.600 --> 43:19.160
Can't reach you,
can I?

43:19.160 --> 43:21.080
See,
I don't know why

43:21.080 --> 43:25.080
people find
self-destruction
so romantic.

43:28.280 --> 43:32.240
I don't know why.

43:32.240 --> 43:36.080
I've always been
drawn that way.

43:36.080 --> 43:39.760
Seductive.

43:39.760 --> 43:42.640
So afraid of death...

43:42.640 --> 43:46.000
..yet I long
to embrace it.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.880
Bury my face
in her dark bosom.

43:48.880 --> 43:51.120
Peace...

43:51.120 --> 43:53.360
..rest...

43:53.360 --> 43:57.360
..oblivion.

43:57.840 --> 44:00.800
God, my life
sickens me.

44:00.800 --> 44:04.000
I'm a poet
and I can't write.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.920
All I can
think about is...

44:06.920 --> 44:09.320
the way
things used to be.

44:09.320 --> 44:11.240
How I was.

44:11.240 --> 44:13.000
How we were.

44:13.000 --> 44:16.040
We were so happy...

44:16.040 --> 44:19.720
..for a time.

44:19.720 --> 44:23.240
I'm dying here.

44:23.240 --> 44:27.240
Puking out my wretched
soul before you.

44:32.280 --> 44:36.280
Donald, help me.

44:36.520 --> 45:27.000
Oh, sweet Jesus,
help me.
