00:08.384 --> 00:10.052
<i>Previously on</i> Agent Carter...

00:10.136 --> 00:12.972
<i>Peg, you work at the
phone company. It ain't life and death.</i>

00:13.055 --> 00:15.516
<i>Darling, you have no idea.</i>

00:16.684 --> 00:18.185
Agent Carter, all hands on deck.

00:18.269 --> 00:19.729
Meaning cover the phones.

00:19.812 --> 00:21.897
<i>Howard, you're asking me
to become a traitor</i>

00:21.981 --> 00:23.232
<i>in order to prove you are not one.</i>

00:23.315 --> 00:25.317
<i>You want a mission
that matters? This is it.</i>

00:25.401 --> 00:26.944
<i>I'm going to regret this,
aren't I?</i>

00:27.028 --> 00:28.070
Absolutely.

00:28.154 --> 00:29.363
<i>My butler, Edwin Jarvis.</i>

00:29.447 --> 00:31.032
<i>He'll help you in any way he can.</i>

00:31.115 --> 00:32.241
Where are you?

00:32.324 --> 00:34.702
Go! Go!

00:34.785 --> 00:37.121
<i>Your line of work
requires support.</i>

00:37.580 --> 00:39.290
<i>There is not a man or woman
who is capable</i>

00:39.373 --> 00:41.792
<i>of carrying the entire world
on their shoulders.</i>

00:41.876 --> 00:43.502
You sweet on her, Sousa?

00:43.586 --> 00:45.838
I was gonna grab a drink.
Want to join me?

00:45.921 --> 00:47.339
Maybe another time, all right?

00:48.758 --> 00:50.301
Sure thing. Another time.

00:50.384 --> 00:51.886
May I introduce you
to our new resident?

00:51.969 --> 00:53.304
Oh, call me Dottie.

00:54.138 --> 00:55.473
Return to your room.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.892
<i>I can be anybody I want.</i>

00:58.017 --> 01:00.269
Maybe I'll be an SSR agent next.

01:03.689 --> 01:04.982
<i>I'm afraid Dottie escaped.</i>

01:05.066 --> 01:07.943
Promise me you'll get
the son of a bitch who did this.

01:08.027 --> 01:09.779
- We'll catch them.
- Attagirl.

01:09.904 --> 01:11.405
- Chief!
- Chief!

01:12.573 --> 01:14.533
<i>You think you know me.
Hands up.</i>

01:14.617 --> 01:15.785
<i>What are
we gonna do about this guy?</i>

01:15.868 --> 01:17.620
<i>We found a way of
preventing him from speaking.</i>

01:17.703 --> 01:20.122
Should you again find yourself
in need of my services,

01:20.206 --> 01:22.124
I would be honoured to
assist you, Miss Carter.

01:22.917 --> 01:24.543
Good work, Carter.

01:24.710 --> 01:26.337
You saved thousands of lives.

01:26.462 --> 01:27.880
You're all lucky that you work for him.

01:27.963 --> 01:29.340
- I just did what needed to be done.
- Yeah.

01:29.423 --> 01:30.466
How can you take that?

01:30.549 --> 01:32.426
<i>It doesn't bother me.
I know my value.</i>

01:48.400 --> 01:50.402
Deposit or a withdrawal?

01:50.903 --> 01:52.905
Withdrawal.

01:52.988 --> 01:54.573
All right, all of you...
Let me see your hands!

01:54.657 --> 01:56.450
- The three of you, over here! Move it!
- Let's go!

01:56.534 --> 01:57.827
Get 'em up!
Hands where I can see them!

01:58.369 --> 01:59.411
This way!

01:59.495 --> 02:00.538
Go, go!

02:00.621 --> 02:02.957
- Please...
- I'm talking to you!

02:03.040 --> 02:04.208
You, too. On your feet.

02:08.504 --> 02:12.633
I'll need the key to
safety deposit box number 143.

02:18.389 --> 02:22.268
Turning that handle to the left
sets off the bank alarm.

02:22.351 --> 02:23.435
For a pittance,

02:23.519 --> 02:26.772
you'll risk your life to protect
someone else's fortune?

02:26.856 --> 02:28.566
Pull it to the right.

02:34.113 --> 02:36.532
Weren't you taught any manners?

02:36.615 --> 02:37.867
Help the geezer.

02:50.004 --> 02:51.589
Dorothy Underwood,
you are under arrest.

02:59.555 --> 03:01.432
Hey, drop that gun!

03:01.515 --> 03:02.641
- Drop it!
- Don't move!

03:02.725 --> 03:03.851
We've got you surrounded!

03:03.934 --> 03:05.519
Don't even think about it.

03:05.603 --> 03:07.354
We are the SSR!

03:08.230 --> 03:09.940
Lower your weapons.

03:11.817 --> 03:13.110
You heard the man.

03:21.994 --> 03:23.120
Hey, look out!

03:38.761 --> 03:40.179
New hairstyle?

03:56.070 --> 03:57.488
Aah!

04:15.089 --> 04:16.715
Love the hat.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.375
He's right here.

04:54.169 --> 04:55.296
You the science cop?

04:56.297 --> 04:57.965
Detective Andrew Henry, homicide.

04:58.048 --> 05:00.426
Daniel Sousa,
Strategic Scientific Reserve.

05:00.509 --> 05:02.011
Oh, I'd shake your hand,
but I'm one of those suckers

05:02.094 --> 05:04.555
who catches a cold whether it's
summer, spring, winter or fall.

05:04.638 --> 05:05.681
What do we got?

05:05.764 --> 05:07.391
You ever hear of
the Lady of the Lake killings?

05:07.474 --> 05:09.643
- Can't say I have.
- How long you been in L.A.?

05:09.727 --> 05:10.769
Six months.

05:10.853 --> 05:12.563
Two years ago,
the Lady of the Lake killer

05:12.646 --> 05:14.815
dropped two dead women
in Echo Park Lake.

05:14.898 --> 05:16.525
I led a task force with manhunts,

05:16.608 --> 05:17.735
press conferences and everything.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.903
- And?
- Never caught the bastard.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.031
He disappeared. Till today.

05:22.114 --> 05:23.157
You found another body.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.117
Dead woman in the exact same lake.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.244
No two ways about it. My guy's back.

05:27.328 --> 05:28.787
So why was the SSR called in?

05:28.871 --> 05:30.956
If it was up to me, you'd be
working on your tan right now,

05:31.040 --> 05:33.834
but my lieutenant's got a bee in
his bonnet about jurisdiction.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.337
The hottest day of the year, right?

05:37.463 --> 05:39.673
Only the lake don't know it.

06:02.738 --> 06:04.156
Look at this.

06:14.416 --> 06:15.542
So...

06:16.418 --> 06:18.879
Until we catch this lunatic,

06:18.962 --> 06:20.839
looks like you and me are partners.

06:37.147 --> 06:38.315
Here are the things you will tell me.

06:38.399 --> 06:41.110
The names of your handlers in Russia,

06:41.193 --> 06:43.570
your methods of communication
with them,

06:43.654 --> 06:44.988
the names and whereabouts

06:45.072 --> 06:47.783
of other communist operatives
on American soil,

06:48.242 --> 06:50.411
<i>why you were targeting
the Bowery Savings Bank,</i>

06:50.494 --> 06:51.537
<i>and who it is you are working for.</i>

06:51.620 --> 06:52.746
Feel like I got a front-row seat

06:52.830 --> 06:55.040
to Rocky Graziano versus Tony Zale.

06:55.290 --> 06:57.000
Quiet.

06:57.543 --> 07:00.671
<i>Peggy, I expected so
much more from you,</i>

07:00.754 --> 07:04.591
not "you will tell
me this and this and this."

07:05.342 --> 07:07.261
Where's your technique?

07:07.719 --> 07:11.098
Girls like you raised with
silver spoons and perfect skin,

07:11.181 --> 07:13.600
you expect everything
to come to you so easily.

07:16.353 --> 07:18.272
You have one chip to trade on...

07:19.064 --> 07:20.149
Fear.

07:20.691 --> 07:22.734
And fear is the one tool

07:22.818 --> 07:26.864
that little girls who grow up handcuffed
to their beds learn.

07:27.239 --> 07:28.532
I, however...

07:31.452 --> 07:32.953
Am not afraid of you.

07:35.330 --> 07:39.585
Now, this was found in deposit box 143.

07:39.668 --> 07:41.670
There was no owner
on the bank registry.

07:41.753 --> 07:43.088
Why did you want it?

07:44.423 --> 07:46.133
Peg...

07:46.216 --> 07:48.677
We both know there are currencies
stronger than money.

07:52.723 --> 07:54.016
If anyone can break Dottie Underwood,

07:54.099 --> 07:55.184
it's Carter.

07:55.267 --> 07:57.478
You two mooks have something
better to do?

07:57.561 --> 07:59.855
Or is your service not needed
at the SSR?

07:59.938 --> 08:02.065
Chief, L.A.'s on the horn.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.192
Thanks.

08:09.031 --> 08:10.991
How's the surf today, Agent Sousa?

08:11.074 --> 08:12.784
That's Chief Sousa to you.

08:12.868 --> 08:15.579
And congratulations, Jack.
I hear you caught Dottie Underwood.

08:15.662 --> 08:16.830
Yeah, we caught
a lead right after you left

08:16.914 --> 08:18.165
to open the West Coast bureau.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.334
<i>Seems as if you were
our bad-luck charm.</i>

08:20.417 --> 08:22.377
You tell that joke at least once a month.

08:22.920 --> 08:23.962
<i>What you got?</i>

08:24.046 --> 08:26.256
We caught a mystery out here...
An ice cube the size of a lake

08:26.340 --> 08:27.841
with a dead woman trapped inside.

08:28.342 --> 08:30.552
- Who's the body?
<i>- Don't know yet.</i>

08:31.136 --> 08:33.180
I got a homicide dick
who says this is the work

08:33.263 --> 08:35.474
of a killer he's been
chasing the past two years.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.309
I'm heading up a task force with him,

08:37.392 --> 08:40.145
but, Jack, my L.A. office is too green.

08:40.604 --> 08:42.523
So, what?
You want to leave New York thin

08:42.606 --> 08:44.149
because the moment
you catch a real case,

08:44.233 --> 08:45.359
<i>you throw your hands in the air?</i>

08:45.484 --> 08:47.152
You know I'm understaffed as is.

08:47.236 --> 08:48.695
I'm sure you can spare one guy.

08:54.326 --> 08:56.036
I have just the man for you.

08:56.745 --> 08:58.121
Thank you.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.170
Are you trying to
undermine this interrogation?

09:05.254 --> 09:06.922
I was just beginning to
make her feel comfortable.

09:07.005 --> 09:08.549
Every interruption
sets me back an hour.

09:08.632 --> 09:10.217
Well, that's no longer your worry.
You're done here.

09:10.425 --> 09:12.302
What? Why?

09:12.386 --> 09:14.763
We caught a high-profile case
that needs eyeballs with experience.

09:14.846 --> 09:15.973
Well, give it to someone else.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.140
No one knows Dottie like I do.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.350
We used to live next door to each other.

09:18.433 --> 09:20.769
Yeah, and you had no idea
she was a spy.

09:23.564 --> 09:25.816
Next flight leaves for
Los Angeles in three hours.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.734
Sousa asked for you and nobody else.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.028
Did he?

09:30.112 --> 09:31.154
Yeah.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.282
It's a real burden being everybody's
favourite agent, isn't it?

09:33.365 --> 09:35.951
If this is about your
insecurity, Chief Thompson,

09:36.034 --> 09:37.828
then I suggest you deal
with it in your own time.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.831
Don't sabotage our first real shot
at uncovering Dottie's true agenda.

09:41.873 --> 09:44.459
Carter... Believe it or not,

09:44.543 --> 09:47.588
the SSR can actually function
without you once in a while.

09:47.671 --> 09:49.381
And who will you have interrogate her?

09:49.464 --> 09:51.133
Plan on doing that myself.

09:51.216 --> 09:53.719
Jack, she isn't afraid of you.

09:53.802 --> 09:54.845
Hmm.

09:58.682 --> 09:59.933
Pack your bags.

10:18.076 --> 10:19.161
Miss Carter.

10:22.039 --> 10:23.498
Mr Jarvis.

10:25.709 --> 10:27.711
Thank you for collecting me.
I hope it wasn't a bother.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.838
Not at all.
I'm delighted to see you again.

10:30.672 --> 10:32.633
- Shall we?
- Um, Mr Jarvis...

10:32.716 --> 10:33.759
Yes?

10:33.842 --> 10:35.636
I understand Howard came out
west for a defence contract.

10:35.719 --> 10:36.762
He did.

10:36.845 --> 10:38.889
And you did say you came out
here to arrange his estate.

10:39.014 --> 10:40.474
I think I see where this is heading.

10:40.557 --> 10:42.643
- What I don't understand...
- You're puzzled, perhaps.

10:42.726 --> 10:44.478
Uh, puzzled, yes, that's the word.

10:44.561 --> 10:45.771
It's the flamingo, isn't it?

10:45.854 --> 10:47.939
It is, indeed, the flamingo.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.400
Regrettably, you are
not the only house guest

10:50.484 --> 10:52.653
to whom Mr Stark has
extended an invitation.

10:53.403 --> 10:56.698
Meet the newest member of
the Stark mansion menagerie...

10:56.782 --> 10:59.034
- Bernard.
- Bernard.

10:59.117 --> 11:00.994
Bernard Stark,
to give his full name.

11:02.663 --> 11:04.665
Ready for another adventure,
Miss Carter?

11:05.916 --> 11:07.084
Uh...

11:10.754 --> 11:11.838
Where is Howard?

11:12.631 --> 11:15.467
Mr Stark's latest
hobby keeps him quite busy.

11:15.592 --> 11:17.427
He's opening a moving picture studio.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.805
Fancies himself to be Cecil B. Demille.

11:19.888 --> 11:21.473
Fatty Arbuckle, more like.

11:21.556 --> 11:23.642
I'll rent a car and get out of
your hair as soon as possible.

11:23.725 --> 11:26.436
Oh, no. With Mr Stark out of town, I can
easily shuttle you from place to place.

11:26.520 --> 11:29.481
- I'd never dream of such an imposition.
- Miss Carter, you have no idea

11:29.564 --> 11:31.066
how foreign Los Angeles will seem

11:31.149 --> 11:33.151
to a civilised person such as yourself.

11:33.235 --> 11:36.655
They eat avocados with everything.

11:36.738 --> 11:38.699
The foliage is preposterous.
Take the palm tree.

11:38.782 --> 11:41.159
Would you trust the structural
integrity of such a thing?

11:41.243 --> 11:43.245
- No, I suppose not.
- They afford no shade.

11:43.787 --> 11:45.497
Everybody says it's a very dry heat,

11:45.580 --> 11:47.457
but that doesn't mean
it isn't unbearably hot.

11:47.541 --> 11:48.583
And worst of all,

11:48.709 --> 11:50.627
the drivers are both abundant
and abundantly irresponsible.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.003
While I appreciate your concern,

11:52.087 --> 11:54.881
I am certain I can hazard the
Los Angeles driving conditions.

11:57.467 --> 11:58.719
Miss Carter, since our last adventure,

11:58.802 --> 12:01.221
my life has consisted of oiling
floorboards, cleaning pools

12:01.304 --> 12:02.764
and...

12:02.973 --> 12:05.058
Transporting exotic livestock.

12:05.142 --> 12:07.519
I'm profoundly and exhaustively bored.

12:07.602 --> 12:10.897
Please, at least until Mr Stark returns,
allow me to drive you around.

12:10.981 --> 12:13.859
When can we expect our
esteemed Mr Stark to return

12:13.942 --> 12:16.111
from the preproductions
of his motion picture?

12:17.446 --> 12:19.406
That depends on how
long the location scout

12:19.531 --> 12:22.534
allows Mr Stark to...
Scout her locations.

12:23.034 --> 12:24.077
Oh.

12:29.291 --> 12:30.834
Are we certain this is the place?

12:30.917 --> 12:32.169
Positive as pie.

12:33.545 --> 12:35.464
Thank you, Mr Jarvis.

12:45.807 --> 12:46.850
Mmm.

12:49.978 --> 12:51.021
Hey, Peg!

12:51.104 --> 12:52.647
I didn't realise you were in town.

12:53.148 --> 12:55.859
Let me show you right
through to Mr Auerbach.

12:57.736 --> 12:58.779
Oh!

13:01.156 --> 13:02.199
I'm sorry.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.659
I don't think you're right
for the Auerbach Theatrical Agency.

13:04.743 --> 13:06.119
Have a nice day.

13:08.497 --> 13:10.832
That's the third place this week.

13:11.416 --> 13:12.542
We don't advertise.

13:12.626 --> 13:14.044
Our sign is barely legible.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.046
Our address is wrong
in the city directory.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.089
And yet, somehow, they find us.

13:18.173 --> 13:20.133
Come. I'll show you right through.

13:22.010 --> 13:24.262
- You out here long?
- Possibly.

13:24.387 --> 13:26.264
Well, that pasty skin's
gonna get burned

13:26.348 --> 13:27.432
if you don't cover up.

13:27.516 --> 13:29.142
Is California to your liking?

13:29.226 --> 13:30.769
I was so sick of those
New York shadows.

13:30.852 --> 13:32.270
The moment I heard Chief Sousa

13:32.354 --> 13:33.396
was heading up the new L.A. bureau,

13:33.480 --> 13:34.856
I leapt at the opportunity.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.025
It's hot out here, sure, but it's a...

13:37.108 --> 13:39.110
- Dry heat.
- Yes.

13:39.611 --> 13:40.987
Do you know I took up surfing?

13:44.032 --> 13:45.742
The "R" to the "S" cabinet.

13:45.826 --> 13:47.994
That's easy enough to remember.

13:53.708 --> 13:55.544
How is... Everything?

13:56.670 --> 13:59.256
Everything is through
the first door on your right.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.507
You can't miss him.

14:18.108 --> 14:20.360
This is Agent O'Malley.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.744
- Well, call him again.
- Yes, sir.

14:29.828 --> 14:31.371
Hello.

14:31.454 --> 14:32.998
Chief.

14:34.249 --> 14:35.458
Peggy.

14:36.835 --> 14:37.961
What are you doing here?

14:38.044 --> 14:39.087
The Lady of the Lake killer.

14:39.170 --> 14:40.213
Right.

14:40.297 --> 14:42.090
Thompson said you requested backup.

14:43.758 --> 14:44.926
Yes, yes. Yes, of course.

14:45.010 --> 14:46.344
Unless you've solved it already.

14:46.428 --> 14:47.888
No, no, no. I... I was expecting...

14:47.971 --> 14:49.055
You didn't put the request in.

14:49.139 --> 14:50.932
- No, I did.
- But not for me.

14:51.016 --> 14:52.893
I just didn't think
you were coming till tomorrow.

14:53.977 --> 14:55.395
Um...

14:56.688 --> 14:57.939
Welcome to Los Angeles.

14:58.023 --> 14:59.149
Thank you.

15:03.069 --> 15:05.196
I know that all your time
has been consumed with setting up

15:05.280 --> 15:07.073
- the SSR's West Coast bureau...
- It has been.

15:07.157 --> 15:09.409
- Travelling across the country...
- And staffing the office, I know.

15:09.492 --> 15:11.953
- But I did call on several occasions.
- I'm sorry. I, uh...

15:12.037 --> 15:14.456
Why didn't you return my messages?

15:16.416 --> 15:17.500
Because sometimes,

15:17.584 --> 15:20.420
a three-hour time difference
feels like a lifetime.

15:21.463 --> 15:22.547
Okay.

15:22.631 --> 15:25.926
I've got three more boxes
of old case files downstairs.

15:27.761 --> 15:30.096
Detective Andrew Henry,
L.A.P.D. Homicide,

15:30.180 --> 15:33.016
this is Agent Peggy Carter,
SSR, New York.

15:34.392 --> 15:35.685
How many of you agents do we need?

15:35.769 --> 15:37.354
As many as it takes to catch the killer.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.522
Well, that's zero. This new body

15:39.648 --> 15:41.900
means I'm gonna have journalists
clawing down my door.

15:41.983 --> 15:43.318
With a little help from the press,

15:43.401 --> 15:45.987
I'll catch our bad guy before
evening rush on Cahuenga Pass.

15:46.071 --> 15:47.989
What if the frozen lake and
the murder aren't connected?

15:48.073 --> 15:50.825
- How do you figure?
- You think they're unrelated.

15:50.909 --> 15:52.160
The body was dumped
at another time...

15:52.243 --> 15:54.788
But was found only when another
incident caused the lake to freeze.

15:54.871 --> 15:56.164
- Unlikely.
- Most doubtful.

15:56.247 --> 15:58.083
- But not impossible.
- What was that old Dooley saying?

15:58.166 --> 16:00.835
"Explore all avenues
for unturned stones."

16:02.379 --> 16:03.755
What's a Dooley?

16:03.838 --> 16:05.215
The SSR came on board

16:05.298 --> 16:07.926
because a body of water
froze during a heat wave.

16:08.009 --> 16:09.886
The first step we should take
is to determine whether or not

16:09.970 --> 16:13.056
the dead body and the frozen
lake are even the same crime.

16:20.522 --> 16:24.067
A thousand heaters blasting in
here and it's still freezing.

16:24.150 --> 16:25.735
I wish you'd called.

16:25.819 --> 16:28.113
- So we'd know to bring long johns?
- So I could tell you not to come.

16:28.238 --> 16:29.739
I don't have an autopsy report.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.533
Meltzer, you're kidding me.

16:31.616 --> 16:33.034
This is the best chance
we've had in two years

16:33.118 --> 16:34.411
- to catch our man.
- Why the delay?

16:34.494 --> 16:36.413
This isn't a layer of frostbite.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.081
She's frozen through and through.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.624
Even with the heat shining on her?

16:39.708 --> 16:42.669
She's only beginning to thaw,
but you'll have to wait a bit longer

16:42.752 --> 16:44.838
unless you want the autopsy
performed with a chisel.

16:44.921 --> 16:46.881
Is there anything you could tell
us from a visual inspection?

16:46.965 --> 16:48.717
Well, her stab wounds are consistent

16:48.800 --> 16:51.052
- with the other Lady of the Lake victims.
- Here's the shoes.

16:51.594 --> 16:52.929
They're on the wrong feet.

16:53.013 --> 16:55.473
Well, the killer's signature is
to switch his victim's shoes.

16:55.557 --> 16:57.475
That detail was never
released to the papers.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.394
See? We got our guy.

16:59.477 --> 17:01.146
Do we know whether the body
caused the lake to freeze

17:01.229 --> 17:02.272
or vice versa?

17:02.355 --> 17:03.648
No.

17:04.566 --> 17:07.902
And to add to your ever-growing list
of things we don't know...

17:08.611 --> 17:10.780
I can't explain this, either.

17:19.956 --> 17:21.666
Fetch a chisel.

17:25.211 --> 17:26.504
That's not ice.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.089
Then what is it?

17:28.173 --> 17:30.759
Short answer is, I don't know.
So is the long answer.

17:31.259 --> 17:32.594
And there's nothing else
you can tell us?

17:32.677 --> 17:34.387
I'm doing my best.

17:34.471 --> 17:38.266
You field agents, always looking down
your noses at us lab techs.

17:38.349 --> 17:39.434
Excuse me?

17:39.517 --> 17:42.562
Just because we don't carry guns
doesn't mean we're not in the SSR.

17:43.063 --> 17:44.272
We value your contributions.

17:44.355 --> 17:45.440
We're just asking...

17:45.523 --> 17:48.151
Then why not invite me
when you agents grab drinks?

17:48.234 --> 17:49.527
Aren't you always invited?

17:49.611 --> 17:52.405
No. Never.

17:52.489 --> 17:53.823
Well, yes.

17:53.907 --> 17:56.117
Of course you're invited, Doctor...

17:56.201 --> 17:57.368
Samberly.

17:57.452 --> 17:58.953
Samberly. Yes, Samberly.

17:59.037 --> 18:00.080
What about the glow?

18:00.163 --> 18:02.916
The non-native matter
is in a radioisotopic form,

18:02.999 --> 18:05.293
ionizing the nitrogen
molecules in the air and blood

18:05.376 --> 18:06.753
to create the luminescence.

18:06.836 --> 18:09.255
The only occurrence that
could create such a phenomenon

18:09.339 --> 18:12.383
is by producing the radioisotope
in the form of uranium.

18:12.467 --> 18:13.843
What does that mean?

18:13.927 --> 18:15.512
She was near a particle accelerator.

18:15.678 --> 18:17.847
The one used in the Manhattan
Project is in Tennessee.

18:17.931 --> 18:21.017
There's another one in
Pasadena at Isodyne Energy.

18:21.101 --> 18:23.937
I applied there but
instead chose to go with SSR.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.063
Unfortunately.

18:27.398 --> 18:29.234
What is Isodyne Energy?

18:29.317 --> 18:31.152
Isodyne Energy is
a development laboratory

18:31.236 --> 18:33.488
dedicated to fuel initiatives
in the 20th century.

18:33.571 --> 18:35.615
Is there anything else
I can help you with today?

18:36.074 --> 18:37.826
Do you know who works with
the particle accelerator?

18:37.909 --> 18:39.077
Our scientists.

18:39.160 --> 18:40.620
Is there anything else
I can help you with today?

18:40.703 --> 18:42.288
We'd like to look around your facilities.

18:42.372 --> 18:44.707
- Do you have a search warrant?
- We do not.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.584
Is there anything else
I can help you with today?

18:46.876 --> 18:47.961
We're pussyfooting around here

18:48.044 --> 18:49.587
while the killer's stalking
his next victim.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.799
Before we leave, um,
may I use your restroom?

18:52.882 --> 18:54.801
Why not? We've already
wasted an hour coming here.

18:54.884 --> 18:56.344
It's on your right.

18:57.137 --> 18:58.638
Is there anything else
I can help you with...

18:58.721 --> 18:59.889
No!

19:02.392 --> 19:03.726
Do I need a search warrant

19:03.810 --> 19:06.396
to know how many years
you've worked at Isodyne?

19:06.688 --> 19:07.856
Oh.

19:08.690 --> 19:10.692
Oh! Excuse me. Sturdy.

19:10.775 --> 19:12.485
Um, three years.

19:15.363 --> 19:18.950
Is there anything else that
I can help you with today?

19:36.885 --> 19:38.178
Do you want to be thunderstruck?

19:39.512 --> 19:40.638
Come.

19:46.394 --> 19:47.687
I hope you'll forgive me,

19:47.770 --> 19:50.899
but what you're about to experience
will change your life forever.

19:50.982 --> 19:52.609
I'm not one for surprises.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.707
Taste this.

20:08.124 --> 20:09.334
Are you poisoning me?

20:10.001 --> 20:12.337
Well, that's ethanol, so...

20:12.420 --> 20:13.671
Yes.

20:20.428 --> 20:22.305
Well, I'm usually a whisky girl,

20:22.388 --> 20:24.265
but this is the best wine
I've ever tasted.

20:24.349 --> 20:27.769
See? See, I realised that by
manipulating the oxygen

20:27.852 --> 20:30.396
in the malic and succinic acids,
I could tweak the pH balan...

20:30.480 --> 20:31.564
So you're a genius.

20:31.648 --> 20:32.941
No.

20:33.524 --> 20:35.109
But yes.

20:37.195 --> 20:38.446
Who are you?

20:39.989 --> 20:43.076
Uh, Agent Carter, with the
Strategic Scientific Reserve.

20:43.159 --> 20:44.619
Do you know this woman?

20:47.372 --> 20:48.539
Oh, my God.

20:49.415 --> 20:51.167
That's Jane Scott.

20:51.251 --> 20:52.418
What happened to her?

20:52.502 --> 20:54.629
Did she work with
the particle accelerator here?

20:54.712 --> 20:56.965
We didn't overlap.
I work in containment research.

20:57.090 --> 20:59.717
- I think she was a particle physicist.
- Did she have any friends here?

21:00.385 --> 21:01.427
Well...

21:02.136 --> 21:05.181
There were some rumours,
but I don't like to participate.

21:05.265 --> 21:06.683
By telling me, you wouldn't
be gossiping about Jane.

21:06.766 --> 21:07.809
You'd be helping her.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.062
Let's just say that

21:11.604 --> 21:13.564
she had a very close relationship

21:13.648 --> 21:15.692
with the owner of Isodyne Energy,

21:16.317 --> 21:17.402
Calvin Chadwick.

21:19.404 --> 21:20.989
By that, I mean they were involved.

21:21.072 --> 21:22.365
Yes, I understand.

21:24.575 --> 21:26.828
- Sleeping together.
- Your point is made.

21:26.911 --> 21:28.288
Excuse me.

21:28.871 --> 21:30.123
I'm sorry I got you caught.

21:30.206 --> 21:32.292
Well, at least they didn't
find my scotch distillery.

21:32.500 --> 21:35.086
Here's my business card.

21:36.129 --> 21:39.007
If I can be of any more help,
or if you want some more wine.

21:39.090 --> 21:41.342
Thank you, Dr Wilkes.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.220
Let me give you my personal number.

21:44.304 --> 21:45.847
Oh, uh...

21:46.139 --> 21:47.265
Very well.

21:47.348 --> 21:49.142
Maybe I should have
your number, as well.

21:51.060 --> 21:53.104
I don't believe that's necessary.

21:55.356 --> 21:57.275
Of course. Great.

21:57.358 --> 21:58.693
Great.

21:58.776 --> 22:00.111
- Thank you.
- Yes.

22:03.156 --> 22:05.908
Calvin Chadwick's office
is stonewalling us, too.

22:05.992 --> 22:08.202
This is a sketch from
a witness's description

22:08.286 --> 22:12.206
of a man seen near Echo Park
late at night two years ago.

22:12.290 --> 22:15.126
You know who this doesn't look like?
Calvin Chadwick.

22:15.209 --> 22:18.296
Mr Chadwick owns a horse racing
this afternoon at Santa Anita.

22:18.379 --> 22:20.173
The man is running for senate.

22:20.256 --> 22:22.842
Well, then he'll be kissing babies and
pressing palms, as well as hooves.

22:22.925 --> 22:24.052
That's not my gist, lady.

22:24.135 --> 22:25.928
Calvin Chadwick is
a wealthy industrialist.

22:26.012 --> 22:28.097
He's not going around killing women
and throwing them in a lake.

22:28.181 --> 22:29.682
What lead are you proposing we follow?

22:29.766 --> 22:31.392
Not one from the word of some janitor.

22:31.476 --> 22:32.602
Jason Wilkes is a physicist!

22:32.685 --> 22:34.729
Look, sweetheart, I don't know
how you do things in New York,

22:34.812 --> 22:36.814
but out here, if we go after Chadwick,

22:36.898 --> 22:39.067
the papers are gonna crucify us when
they find out we're wrong.

22:39.150 --> 22:41.486
- And what if we're right?
- How would you handle it, Detective?

22:41.569 --> 22:43.988
I would use the press to our advantage.

22:44.072 --> 22:46.824
Give an interview to the newsreels,
get the word out there.

22:46.908 --> 22:48.159
I take it you have
journalist contacts?

22:48.242 --> 22:50.370
I got contacts all over the place.

22:50.995 --> 22:52.455
I'll arrange everything, okay?

22:52.538 --> 22:53.831
Have at it.

22:54.499 --> 22:55.541
We'll comb through your old files,

22:55.625 --> 22:56.834
see if there isn't a clue we missed.

22:56.918 --> 22:58.086
Thank you.

23:00.963 --> 23:03.591
El Lobo's racing in the fourth.

23:03.674 --> 23:05.968
Place a bet for me
after you find Chadwick.

23:11.307 --> 23:13.684
My wife, Ana, has
a very modern sense of style.

23:13.768 --> 23:15.686
I'm certain she'll have picked
out the perfect outfit for you

23:15.770 --> 23:17.730
for a covert operation at the races.

23:17.814 --> 23:19.357
If she's your stylist, what can go wrong?

23:26.531 --> 23:28.616
I couldn't manoeuvre
him into the enclosure.

23:29.951 --> 23:31.577
He's the devil in pink.

23:34.414 --> 23:35.957
Mrs Jarvis!

23:36.624 --> 23:38.084
Miss Carter is here.

23:38.167 --> 23:39.293
Miss Carter,

23:39.377 --> 23:41.254
- I feel like I already know you.
- Oh.

23:41.337 --> 23:42.505
Oh.

23:42.672 --> 23:44.006
She hugs.

23:45.258 --> 23:46.384
She does not hug.

23:46.467 --> 23:47.677
It's a pleasure to finally meet.

23:47.802 --> 23:49.137
Yes.

23:49.220 --> 23:51.180
Well, I'll give you both some privacy.

23:51.681 --> 23:53.266
Excuse me, Mr Jarvis.

23:55.977 --> 23:57.103
Oh.

23:57.687 --> 23:58.896
Hmm.

24:08.739 --> 24:10.825
She's an embarrassing creature.

24:14.245 --> 24:15.746
He's too easy.

24:16.372 --> 24:17.665
What's that look?

24:17.748 --> 24:18.916
Uh, I don't know.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.501
I suppose I was expecting
someone more...

24:20.585 --> 24:23.004
Like Mr Jarvis? In a girdle?

24:23.087 --> 24:25.423
Precisely.

24:25.506 --> 24:27.341
From his tales of your heroics,

24:27.425 --> 24:30.470
I was picturing a circus strongman
in a wig.

24:30.553 --> 24:34.098
I've selected a few potential
ensembles for the racetrack,

24:34.182 --> 24:37.185
but I've also sewed you...

24:38.561 --> 24:39.645
This.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.105
What is it?

24:41.564 --> 24:42.607
A garter.

24:44.317 --> 24:45.902
That's also a holster.

24:45.985 --> 24:48.571
You are fantastic.

25:06.047 --> 25:07.673
That is Calvin Chadwick.

25:10.968 --> 25:12.929
Oh, and his wife, Whitney Frost.

25:13.012 --> 25:14.263
Who?

25:14.347 --> 25:16.432
Whitney Frost, star of
<i>The "F" Stands for Freedom.</i>

25:16.516 --> 25:17.558
She doesn't look familiar.

25:17.642 --> 25:19.477
Well, surely you've
seen <i>Tales of Suspense.</i>

25:19.560 --> 25:21.103
I'm not one for the cinema.

25:22.021 --> 25:23.856
What do you do for relaxation?

25:23.940 --> 25:25.191
Assemble rifles?

25:25.650 --> 25:27.944
I trust you to distract
her with your flattery.

25:28.861 --> 25:31.656
Aside from "Danger,"
my middle name is "Charm."

25:38.162 --> 25:39.539
Excuse me. Miss Frost?

25:40.039 --> 25:41.249
Edwin Jarvis.

25:41.332 --> 25:42.750
Head of production, Stark Pictures.

25:42.833 --> 25:44.377
Oh. Charmed.

25:45.336 --> 25:46.671
Might I have a word?

25:48.923 --> 25:49.966
Mr Chadwick,

25:50.091 --> 25:52.426
I am one of your
biggest advocates for senate.

25:52.510 --> 25:54.178
What a delight to see

25:54.262 --> 25:55.805
such an attractive
young woman like yourself

25:55.888 --> 25:56.931
interested in politics.

25:57.014 --> 26:00.184
If you don't beat that ugly
old Representative Anderson,

26:00.268 --> 26:02.562
California is gonna go
to hell in hand basket.

26:04.272 --> 26:05.940
I think I need you on
my campaign committee.

26:06.023 --> 26:09.110
Why, just the other day,
I was extolling your virtues

26:09.193 --> 26:11.779
to a dear friend of mine, uh, Jane Scott.

26:13.281 --> 26:15.199
Yes. Well...

26:15.783 --> 26:17.034
Thank you for your support.

26:17.118 --> 26:19.036
Are you aware that Miss Scott is dead?

26:22.081 --> 26:23.541
Who did you say you are, miss?

26:23.624 --> 26:25.751
Agent Peggy Carter with the SSR.

26:25.835 --> 26:27.128
When was the last time
you saw Miss Scott?

26:27.211 --> 26:29.463
Is it SSR protocol to surprise people

26:29.547 --> 26:31.215
with the death notices
of their employees?

26:31.299 --> 26:33.926
I understand she was more
privileged than an employee.

26:34.010 --> 26:35.428
Is your wife aware you
were having an affair?

26:36.470 --> 26:38.639
You would be perfect for the lead role

26:38.723 --> 26:40.683
in the new Stark Pictures production.

26:40.766 --> 26:43.144
Really? And what's the picture?

26:43.644 --> 26:44.812
The movie? Yes.

26:44.895 --> 26:47.273
That Stark Pictures
is currently casting

26:47.356 --> 26:48.816
is called...

26:50.526 --> 26:52.194
<i>- The British Are Coming.</i>
- Mmm.

26:52.570 --> 26:54.447
I'm tired of costume dramas,
to be honest.

26:54.530 --> 26:57.116
Oh, no, no, no.
This would be a spy picture.

26:57.199 --> 26:59.577
No, you'd play a female agent.

26:59.660 --> 27:02.246
- Tough as nails.
- Now I'm intrigued.

27:02.955 --> 27:05.833
So, she doesn't have a love interest?

27:06.834 --> 27:08.502
Um, uh...

27:08.711 --> 27:11.047
We haven't found the right actor yet.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.298
If you have nothing to hide,

27:12.381 --> 27:14.634
you'll hand over a complete list of
employees at Isodyne Energy.

27:14.717 --> 27:17.136
I'm a patriot and I would gladly help,

27:17.219 --> 27:19.597
but Isodyne Energy deals in
classified and confidential

27:19.680 --> 27:21.098
United States government contracts.

27:22.350 --> 27:26.562
If you get proper clearance,
I will give you a tour myself.

27:26.646 --> 27:29.690
And in the meantime,
I have to collect my winnings.

27:29.774 --> 27:31.609
Have a good day, Miss Carter.

27:34.737 --> 27:36.697
- Hello, love.
- Mr Jarvis, our horse lost.

27:36.781 --> 27:38.115
Oh, no.

27:38.699 --> 27:40.201
We'll be in touch, Miss Frost.

27:46.582 --> 27:47.708
Chadwick was nervous.

27:48.209 --> 27:50.378
He has more to hide than
a dalliance with an employee.

27:50.628 --> 27:52.129
Now that the autopsy report's complete,

27:52.213 --> 27:53.714
we'll have a better idea
of what happened.

27:55.883 --> 27:58.594
Been on this case for two years
and you're not gonna wait for me?

27:58.678 --> 27:59.720
Boy.

28:04.934 --> 28:06.519
Still freezing in here.

28:06.602 --> 28:08.938
How did Meltzer even cut into the body?

28:09.021 --> 28:10.648
What'd you find, Dr Meltzer?

28:14.527 --> 28:16.070
Dr Meltzer?

28:35.756 --> 28:37.758
It's been over 24 hours.

28:37.842 --> 28:39.844
Shouldn't I get a phone call?

28:44.932 --> 28:47.226
- Where's Peggy?
- Carter?

28:47.309 --> 28:49.186
She's moved on to a new case.

28:50.229 --> 28:52.064
You're yesterday's news for her.

28:58.362 --> 29:00.823
But who's gonna interrogate me?

29:02.783 --> 29:04.493
My boss and I...

29:04.577 --> 29:09.457
We used to have this routine
to get suspects to turn.

29:09.540 --> 29:11.834
He was the carrot, and I was the stick.

29:12.418 --> 29:15.296
He spoke smoothly,
and I didn't speak at all.

29:16.255 --> 29:20.384
See, the problem is, is that you and
your commie friends, well...

29:21.719 --> 29:23.220
You killed the carrot.

29:42.948 --> 29:44.533
And I'm not afraid of you.

29:47.745 --> 29:48.788
What you're gonna tell me...

29:52.208 --> 29:54.960
You're too easy. We need Peggy.

29:56.086 --> 29:57.630
Jack!

30:02.968 --> 30:05.095
Did Agent Carter mention
what she wanted me to see?

30:05.179 --> 30:07.473
Only that it was of
the utmost importance.

30:15.523 --> 30:16.690
That used to be a person?

30:17.525 --> 30:19.485
Can you explain
such an occurrence?

30:19.568 --> 30:20.820
Not even in my nightmares.

30:20.903 --> 30:22.279
Oh, my God. I need some air.

30:23.948 --> 30:25.115
If we lent you a sample,

30:25.199 --> 30:27.827
are there tests you could run
to determine what happened?

30:27.910 --> 30:29.286
Yes. Yes.

30:29.370 --> 30:31.247
This is a lot to take in.

30:31.997 --> 30:34.083
Dr Wilkes, can you excuse us, please?

30:34.583 --> 30:35.835
Yeah. Um...

30:36.335 --> 30:37.586
I'm gonna get some water.

31:07.032 --> 31:08.158
What is it?

31:08.242 --> 31:09.702
The official autopsy report.

31:09.785 --> 31:11.745
Cause of death, organ failure due
to unknown toxic substance.

31:11.829 --> 31:13.455
Exactly... Not the stab wounds.

31:13.539 --> 31:15.374
So someone stabbed the body
after she'd already died.

31:15.457 --> 31:17.543
The murderer wanted us
to think Jane Scott

31:17.626 --> 31:19.086
was killed by the
Lady of the Lake killer...

31:19.169 --> 31:20.296
When actually, she was killed

31:20.379 --> 31:22.047
from exposure to the substance
that froze the lake.

31:22.131 --> 31:23.507
Her shoes were switched on her feet.

31:23.591 --> 31:24.800
The only people that knew that detail

31:24.884 --> 31:26.343
were the actual
Lady of the Lake killer and...

31:26.427 --> 31:27.845
And the police.

31:27.928 --> 31:29.722
Where's Detective Henry?

31:31.891 --> 31:33.559
Keep it moving. Go.

31:33.642 --> 31:34.685
- Gentlemen!
- Tighten your jaw.

31:34.768 --> 31:36.228
- Excuse me?
- He's gonna...

31:36.687 --> 31:38.606
- Hit you.
- Get in.

31:38.689 --> 31:40.024
What is it you expect me to do?

31:40.107 --> 31:42.610
You're gonna fix me. Go.

31:50.701 --> 31:53.412
Tell me, who were you
stealing this pin from?

31:53.495 --> 31:55.831
Why did you want it so badly?

31:57.333 --> 32:01.378
Now that I have your interest,
what will you give me?

32:01.879 --> 32:03.380
Me give you?

32:05.466 --> 32:07.176
A beating you won't forget.

32:08.594 --> 32:11.472
If you want more from
me than a sore throat,

32:11.555 --> 32:14.016
this needs to be an exchange.

32:14.558 --> 32:16.143
Peggy would've known that.

32:16.268 --> 32:19.355
And what does that sick head of yours
think Carter would've offered you?

32:19.438 --> 32:21.315
Deportation is better than prison.

32:21.398 --> 32:23.192
Prison is better than the electric chair.

32:23.567 --> 32:24.902
Deal.

32:25.319 --> 32:26.987
Show me the paperwork,
and I will tell you

32:27.071 --> 32:30.491
exactly who I was stealing
that lapel pin from and why.

32:32.701 --> 32:34.370
Hey!

32:34.453 --> 32:37.247
This is a federal interrogation.
Who let you in here?

32:37.331 --> 32:39.458
I did, Jack.

32:39.708 --> 32:41.460
The Federal Bureau of Investigation

32:41.543 --> 32:43.754
will be taking custody
of Miss Underwood.

32:46.173 --> 32:49.385
Jack, you are doing great work.

32:49.468 --> 32:51.595
You're making a real name for yourself.

32:52.012 --> 32:53.889
Then why does the FBI get the prize?

32:53.973 --> 32:56.016
Let's get a drink.

32:56.100 --> 32:57.851
Tell Peggy I say bye.

32:58.727 --> 33:00.145
All right, this way. Let's go.

33:02.940 --> 33:04.274
Come on, Jack.

33:12.658 --> 33:14.952
The suspect is
Detective Andrew Henry, L.A.P.D.

33:15.035 --> 33:17.079
He is armed and dangerous.
Approach with caution.

33:17.162 --> 33:18.998
Oh! Oh, is it broken?

33:19.206 --> 33:20.749
You'll live. Keep your head back.

33:20.833 --> 33:23.460
Of course I'll live.
I'm worried about the aesthetic.

33:23.544 --> 33:25.546
Ana's absolutely mad about my profile.

33:25.629 --> 33:26.672
Look.

33:37.224 --> 33:38.308
Keep your head down.

33:38.392 --> 33:41.270
A bullet hitting your nose will
be harder to explain to Ana.

33:42.104 --> 33:44.356
Andrew Henry! Jason Wilkes!

33:44.440 --> 33:46.650
If you're inside,
come out with your hands raised!

33:46.734 --> 33:48.360
The windows are frosted over.

33:53.407 --> 33:54.867
Steering column's frozen.

33:54.950 --> 33:56.118
He had to ditch the car.

33:56.201 --> 33:58.328
Dr Wilkes left us a bread crumb.

33:58.412 --> 34:01.123
Mr Jarvis, I'll need you
to wait here for the police.

34:01.206 --> 34:03.625
- Direct them to follow us.
- Will do.

34:04.460 --> 34:06.128
Here.

34:09.214 --> 34:10.549
Well, I suppose this is progress.

34:10.632 --> 34:12.760
Only use it if absolutely necessary.

34:13.385 --> 34:14.887
And tell the police not to fire, either.

34:14.970 --> 34:16.430
We have a lot of
questions for Detective Henry.

34:16.513 --> 34:19.099
Very well.
But if I do see this Detective Henry,

34:19.183 --> 34:21.310
I can't promise not to
bludgeon his nose.

34:22.603 --> 34:23.854
So the cops will spot you.

34:25.397 --> 34:26.899
I shall be a beacon of justice.

34:29.985 --> 34:31.987
We're nowhere near Isodyne!

34:32.071 --> 34:34.114
Listen, I'm sure you
had a perfectly good reason

34:34.198 --> 34:35.282
for killing Jane.

34:35.365 --> 34:37.993
- I didn't kill anyone.
- Then why are you doing this?

34:38.494 --> 34:41.872
For the right money, I clean
up other people's messes.

34:41.955 --> 34:45.459
So when I was hired to take
care of Jane Scott's body,

34:45.542 --> 34:47.920
I made it look like
the Lady of the Lake killer

34:48.003 --> 34:49.755
to revive the case.

34:49.838 --> 34:52.674
My lieutenant had pulled
all my resources!

34:53.258 --> 34:55.636
Don't you see? I'm a good guy!

34:57.304 --> 34:59.014
You go left, I'll go right.

34:59.098 --> 35:00.891
- Give a shout if it gets chilly.
- You, too.

35:00.974 --> 35:02.184
Oh, oh!

35:02.267 --> 35:04.436
You hear that? Put your gun down,
let them help you.

35:04.520 --> 35:06.105
We'll lose them, okay?
And then you're gonna cure me!

35:08.982 --> 35:10.317
Don't fire!

35:10.442 --> 35:11.485
Let's go! Move in!

35:13.779 --> 35:14.947
Hi.

35:15.030 --> 35:17.658
I said no guns. Holster your weapons.

35:17.741 --> 35:18.909
Where is Detective Henry?

35:18.992 --> 35:21.161
- Back that way.
- Stay here.

35:21.245 --> 35:22.788
You should, too.

35:47.980 --> 35:49.106
Put down the gun.

35:49.189 --> 35:51.358
Or what? You're gonna kill me?

35:51.441 --> 35:54.027
Look at me. I'm dying!

35:54.111 --> 35:55.696
We can help you.

35:55.779 --> 35:58.365
I won't last. You'll see.

35:58.448 --> 36:01.118
- Take a step back.
- We can work this out.

36:01.201 --> 36:03.245
- They're not gonna let us.
- Who won't let us?

36:06.707 --> 36:07.833
I said no guns!

36:07.916 --> 36:09.251
I'm sorry.

36:09.334 --> 36:11.044
I left my radio in the car.

36:15.132 --> 36:17.217
Do you have any idea
how much legwork it took

36:17.301 --> 36:18.385
to catch Dottie Underwood?

36:18.468 --> 36:19.511
Of course I do.

36:19.595 --> 36:21.555
Don't you trust me to grill her?

36:23.390 --> 36:26.810
Jack, who's been your biggest
supporter since day one?

36:28.020 --> 36:29.354
You have, Vernon.

36:29.438 --> 36:31.273
When your father called me,

36:31.356 --> 36:34.193
talking about his
war hero son acting aimless,

36:34.276 --> 36:37.029
who got you the gig at
the best intelligence agency

36:37.112 --> 36:38.488
both sides of the Atlantic?

36:38.572 --> 36:40.782
And I appreciate
everything you've done. I do.

36:40.866 --> 36:42.701
I just...

36:42.784 --> 36:44.828
I feel like the person who fights the bear

36:44.912 --> 36:46.622
should be the one to get the honey.

36:46.705 --> 36:49.541
I'd never steer you wrong, Jack.

36:51.293 --> 36:54.963
Then why are you giving the FBI credit
for the capture of Underwood?

36:56.131 --> 36:59.092
You need to start
playing the long game here.

36:59.176 --> 37:02.721
The SSR is a wartime agency,
and the war is over.

37:03.680 --> 37:05.015
Am I being fired?

37:05.098 --> 37:06.391
Worse.

37:06.934 --> 37:08.435
You're becoming irrelevant.

37:09.937 --> 37:12.856
The entire department of war
is being restructured,

37:12.940 --> 37:16.860
which means that the SSR is going
the way of the dinosaur.

37:16.944 --> 37:19.112
It's a different world now.

37:20.197 --> 37:21.823
And you've got to ask yourself,

37:21.907 --> 37:25.410
"Do I want to be
the former chief of the SSR

37:25.494 --> 37:28.080
"or the current muckety-muck
of the next big thing?"

37:30.582 --> 37:31.792
I want to be in the muck.

37:33.502 --> 37:35.545
And that's the kind of attitude

37:35.629 --> 37:37.756
that's gonna serve you very well.

37:39.841 --> 37:42.386
Dottie Underwood was
attempting to steal

37:42.469 --> 37:45.931
from some very powerful men who have
even more powerful allies.

37:46.807 --> 37:47.891
Like who?

37:48.892 --> 37:51.353
The important thing is, you stopped her,

37:51.478 --> 37:53.605
and those men, they know you did.

37:53.689 --> 37:56.149
Now, you keep your nose
to the grindstone,

37:56.233 --> 37:58.360
and they'll make sure
that your next position

37:58.443 --> 38:00.070
befits your pretty face.

38:09.288 --> 38:11.957
Dr Wilkes, I feel responsible

38:12.040 --> 38:13.625
for putting you in danger's path.

38:15.127 --> 38:17.504
Wonder how many days it will
take my heartbeat to slow.

38:17.587 --> 38:20.257
If whatever killed Detective Henry
and the medical examiner

38:20.340 --> 38:22.342
is contagious,
then we've all been exposed.

38:22.426 --> 38:24.594
I'm guessing that whatever it is,

38:24.678 --> 38:25.846
you can't get it

38:25.929 --> 38:27.639
unless you've been
exposed to contaminated blood.

38:27.723 --> 38:29.516
The medical examiner
had the most intense

38:29.599 --> 38:30.684
and prolonged exposure,

38:30.767 --> 38:32.894
which may explain
why he succumbed first.

38:32.978 --> 38:34.187
At your earliest convenience,

38:34.271 --> 38:35.397
I'm going to need a written report

38:35.480 --> 38:37.607
stating exactly what
Detective Henry told you.

38:38.358 --> 38:40.277
I'll get it to you immediately.

38:41.278 --> 38:45.240
I want to thank you properly for
saving my life, Agent Carter.

38:45.490 --> 38:47.034
That's not necessary.

38:48.076 --> 38:49.995
How about dinner and dancing?

38:50.078 --> 38:51.330
This Saturday evening?

38:53.040 --> 38:54.416
You're a brave man.

38:55.709 --> 38:59.212
But I make it my policy
not to socialize with persons of interest.

38:59.671 --> 39:01.757
Of course.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.175
That makes perfect sense.

39:04.176 --> 39:06.386
But it's nice to know
you find me interesting.

39:20.734 --> 39:22.486
The job's done.

39:29.951 --> 39:31.453
Good man.

39:40.128 --> 39:42.923
See, hon?
You figured out how to fix it all.

39:44.424 --> 39:47.302
And that's the last time we should
have to dirty our hands, hmm?

39:48.095 --> 39:51.181
Just because you dirtied
other parts of your anatomy.

39:55.185 --> 39:57.312
I'm not sure whether
you follow the adventure

39:57.396 --> 39:58.939
or the adventure follows you.

39:59.022 --> 40:00.774
Who do you think killed Jane Scott?

40:00.857 --> 40:02.442
- I don't know.
- Me, neither.

40:03.318 --> 40:05.570
Then the case isn't closed.

40:05.654 --> 40:07.572
Guess I'll be around for a bit longer.

40:07.656 --> 40:09.699
You think that scientist will help us out?

40:09.783 --> 40:12.119
He'll write a report,
but I doubt he'll know

40:12.202 --> 40:14.037
the full extent of what
his employers are up to.

40:14.121 --> 40:16.081
- Right.
- Was quite a night.

40:16.164 --> 40:18.166
God, I could do with a drink.

40:18.250 --> 40:19.626
How about you?

40:20.168 --> 40:21.753
I can't tonight.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.548
- Maybe another time?
- Yes, of course.

40:25.590 --> 40:29.010
- I forgot my jacket. Go on without me.
- Oh. Night.

40:29.094 --> 40:30.554
Night.

40:34.391 --> 40:35.934
Daniel!

40:37.060 --> 40:38.478
Over here.

40:42.607 --> 40:43.650
What are you doing here?

40:44.776 --> 40:46.611
- Hi.
- What a surprise.

40:47.112 --> 40:48.947
I got off work early.

40:52.492 --> 40:53.535
Let's get out of here.

41:01.877 --> 41:03.211
I'm parked down here!
