00:47.438 --> 00:49.338
It's alive!

01:07.522 --> 01:10.889
¤ I love you, you love me ¤

01:10.926 --> 01:12.917
But I'm not in love with you.

01:14.796 --> 01:17.196
- I win.
- Where? I can't see.

01:17.232 --> 01:19.257
Here, diagonally.

01:19.301 --> 01:21.097
Pretty sneaky, sis.

01:22.069 --> 01:25.436
- Barney boy, this is the life.
- You said it, Fred.

01:25.473 --> 01:28.465
An entire civilization
not wearing underwear.

01:28.509 --> 01:30.272
You got to love it.

01:30.311 --> 01:32.609
Now, who could that be?

01:32.647 --> 01:35.774
- Yeah?
- Hi. I'm Mr. Rock from Fedexstone.

01:35.815 --> 01:41.583
I got a delivery for Fred Flintstone
from amazonaboulder. Com-pebble.

01:41.621 --> 01:43.953
Sometimes the rock puns don't fit too well.

01:43.990 --> 01:45.548
You want the package or not?

01:45.592 --> 01:49.425
"Dear Fred, I hope this distracted
you long enough.

01:49.461 --> 01:54.990
"Signed, Barney.
P.S. I invented paper. Bitchin!"

01:56.935 --> 01:58.596
Barney! My Pebbles!

02:00.773 --> 02:02.365
You can't catch me, Fred.

02:10.281 --> 02:11.908
Hey, good one, Fred. Good...

02:14.752 --> 02:17.687
Damn it, Fred.
I just wanted some of your fucking cereal.

02:17.722 --> 02:20.588
Oh, his head always was full of rocks.

02:21.425 --> 02:23.985
A witness. Witnesses!

02:24.027 --> 02:27.224
- The dishwasher.
- My goodness Cretaceous!

02:27.264 --> 02:29.596
- The record player.
- He's off his rocker.

02:29.633 --> 02:33.295
- The bidet!
- Oh, man, the things I've witnessed.

02:36.305 --> 02:39.934
Is he stone cold crazy?
You bet Jurassic.

02:39.975 --> 02:43.172
No more puns!

02:45.181 --> 02:49.082
So he's trying to sell me a tampon
but I said, "It's just a rock... "

02:49.117 --> 02:52.245
and he said,
"Well, duh. Everything's a rock. "

02:52.287 --> 02:53.652
The nerve of some people.

02:55.290 --> 02:57.155
My God!

02:58.827 --> 03:02.557
Lord, please don't stop him
before he kills me.

03:03.597 --> 03:07.931
Fruity Pebbles are an important part
of this complete breakfast.

03:08.335 --> 03:11.862
I'm sorry. There are no Rs.

03:11.905 --> 03:15.306
¤ I love you, you love me ¤

03:15.342 --> 03:17.605
Either way, it's 50 bucks.

03:17.643 --> 03:20.578
Tired of Slip 'n Slide?

03:20.613 --> 03:24.071
Water balloons no fun?
Then get ready for...

03:24.117 --> 03:27.052
the Phyllis Diller Spray-n-Play.

03:29.655 --> 03:31.748
I'm having fun!

03:31.790 --> 03:34.418
I love you, Phyllis Diller Spray-n-Play.

03:34.459 --> 03:35.983
That hurt!

03:36.027 --> 03:38.052
I'm not having fun.

03:44.269 --> 03:49.035
You're gonna have some fun today
with the Phyllis Diller Spray-n-Play.

03:49.774 --> 03:53.904
Go, go, Gadget Hooker-Clean.

03:56.747 --> 03:59.045
Here we will build a great pyramid...

03:59.083 --> 04:03.280
an everlasting testament
to my extreme awesomeness.

04:03.319 --> 04:04.877
Yes, Pharaoh.

04:04.921 --> 04:08.413
But, sir, what will we use
for raw materials?

04:09.893 --> 04:12.487
Your Majesty, we ran out of brown bricks.

04:12.529 --> 04:16.123
It's all good in the 'hood, baby.
Just use yellow bricks.

04:16.165 --> 04:19.100
Running low on yellow,
but there's lots of blue.

04:19.134 --> 04:20.226
No stress.

04:21.269 --> 04:24.171
Your Majesty,
we kind of skipped step 18...

04:24.206 --> 04:26.140
and now it's too late to go back.

04:26.175 --> 04:27.472
Come on.

04:27.509 --> 04:29.875
Everything is sort of leaning to the right.

04:29.912 --> 04:31.572
Hope that's cool.

04:32.880 --> 04:33.938
Yes?

04:33.981 --> 04:37.075
Some of the slaves
got into the Space Legos...

04:37.118 --> 04:41.282
and added some satellite dishes
and a big grappling arm...

04:41.322 --> 04:43.517
to the west side of the pyramid.

04:43.558 --> 04:47.049
Whip them!
Whip the piss right out of them.

04:47.093 --> 04:48.355
Yes, sir.

04:48.395 --> 04:52.195
Although that does
sound kind of kick-ass.

04:55.402 --> 04:56.835
Your Majesty?

04:56.870 --> 04:59.236
We're officially out of Legos.

04:59.272 --> 05:01.102
Lots of Duplo blocks, though.

05:01.140 --> 05:04.871
I'll Duplo you in the nut bag. Get out!

05:04.910 --> 05:06.935
Ready for the big unveiling?

05:06.979 --> 05:08.844
Show me, show me, show me.

05:12.051 --> 05:15.281
- What's this?
- Your grave, motherf...

05:16.988 --> 05:21.118
Take that, Tutanhymen.
I hereby declare...

05:21.159 --> 05:26.392
the Funky Space Pyramid of the People
open for business.

05:34.004 --> 05:35.028
Just right.

05:35.072 --> 05:38.200
You won't believe you're
eating Ron Jeremy's butter.

05:45.948 --> 05:47.438
Sydney, where are you?

05:53.723 --> 05:57.386
Sydney, the top-secret device
is in a wall safe in the basement.

06:05.100 --> 06:07.432
I knew your credentials
didn't check out.

06:07.469 --> 06:09.869
Prize-winning cellist, my ass!

06:09.905 --> 06:11.429
Get her.

06:19.246 --> 06:23.307
I love you, Sydney,
but we just can't be together.

06:26.520 --> 06:27.884
Sydney!

06:29.923 --> 06:32.824
Yeah!

06:39.899 --> 06:41.890
Damned kids.

06:41.935 --> 06:47.236
¤ I love you, you love me ¤

06:47.272 --> 06:48.830
Damn right.

06:50.242 --> 06:52.301
Dad, could you kick an angel's ass?

06:52.344 --> 06:55.802
- You're damn right, I could.
- Is that Santa on the roof?

06:55.847 --> 06:58.440
Well, if not, I got a present for him.

06:58.482 --> 07:01.007
Santa! Santa!

07:01.052 --> 07:07.116
My mother-fucking knee!
Ah, fuck. Shit. Ah, fucking.

07:07.158 --> 07:10.286
Fuck it all to hell.
That hurts like a motherfucker.

07:10.328 --> 07:11.817
Dad, what's a scrotum?

07:14.030 --> 07:16.897
- Santa, what happened?
- Bandits, Goku.

07:16.933 --> 07:22.599
They stole my reindeer
and all the presents and my pants.

07:23.773 --> 07:25.001
Christmas is ours.

07:25.041 --> 07:27.167
You'll never get away with this.

07:27.209 --> 07:30.701
I've got five good reasons
for you to shut up.

07:30.746 --> 07:32.475
One, two, three, four, five.

07:33.949 --> 07:37.578
- Dad, who are those guys?
- Kung fu legends.

07:37.619 --> 07:39.587
That's the Little Drummer Boy...

07:39.621 --> 07:43.147
whose mystical drum
conjures demons most foul.

07:43.191 --> 07:44.590
The Nutcracker...

07:44.625 --> 07:48.425
who knows over 100 different
testicle-based attacks.

07:48.463 --> 07:52.297
And Composite Santa Claus,
who looks like one half Santa...

07:52.333 --> 07:54.426
and one half Frosty the Snowman.

07:54.469 --> 07:56.663
What are Composite Santa's powers?

07:56.703 --> 07:59.467
I don't know, but he freaks me
right the fuck out.

08:02.142 --> 08:03.268
Intruders!

08:03.310 --> 08:06.302
I will conjure a demon
with my magical drum.

08:18.224 --> 08:19.782
Spirit Ball!

08:26.297 --> 08:28.288
Holy shit!

08:29.834 --> 08:31.392
I'll get this one, dad.

08:32.236 --> 08:35.638
- You're not so tough.
- Testicle attack number 49!

08:36.808 --> 08:38.035
My dragon ball.

08:48.452 --> 08:50.113
OK. I got nothing.

08:53.624 --> 08:56.490
Temperatures over
32 degrees Fahrenheit...

08:56.526 --> 08:58.687
my only weakness.

08:59.395 --> 09:02.091
- We did it.
- Fools!

09:02.131 --> 09:04.759
- Mrs. Santa?
- That's right.

09:04.801 --> 09:09.499
The mastermind behind
this evil attack on Christmas is me!

09:09.538 --> 09:13.406
- But why?
- It all started at the North Pole.

09:13.442 --> 09:16.002
I started getting terrible headaches.

09:16.044 --> 09:18.308
Mrs. Claus, are you OK?

09:20.182 --> 09:22.742
At first, I thought it was merely my period...

09:22.784 --> 09:26.742
but that was not the case,
as I hit menopause centuries ago.

09:30.324 --> 09:34.954
Polar radiation forced
an evolutionary change in me.

09:34.995 --> 09:37.623
Now I want revenge.

09:40.300 --> 09:42.200
Darling, no!

09:50.743 --> 09:54.234
Gohan and I need a minute to rest.
It's up to you for now.

09:54.279 --> 09:57.612
- I think one of them popped.
- It's payback time.

09:57.649 --> 10:00.914
Let's beat her up so bad,
her kids will inherit the bruises.

10:00.953 --> 10:04.013
Yeah. We'll hit her so hard,
she'll starve to death rolling.

10:04.056 --> 10:08.116
She's so ugly, we'll push her face in dough
and make gorilla biscuits.

10:08.159 --> 10:10.593
She's so black,
when she go to night school...

10:10.628 --> 10:12.061
teacher mark her absent.

10:12.096 --> 10:14.087
That's still my wife, guys.

10:14.132 --> 10:16.362
Kill!

10:19.637 --> 10:21.537
Your nose shoots lasers?

10:21.572 --> 10:24.335
You didn't think
there was a reason it glows red?

10:24.374 --> 10:26.808
What does yours shoot?

10:26.843 --> 10:29.004
To think, I wanted to play your games.

10:35.051 --> 10:38.178
She's grown too gigantic and unstable.

10:38.220 --> 10:40.017
Women. Am I right, fellas?

10:46.195 --> 10:49.323
The Tenka'ichi Budokai
is finally complete.

10:49.365 --> 10:53.323
What the fuck are you talking about?
Was that even English?

10:53.368 --> 10:55.495
What happened to my wife?

10:56.538 --> 10:59.701
This is the last time
I bring presents to Japan.

11:20.826 --> 11:23.795
Sit, Ubu. Sit.
Bad dog.
