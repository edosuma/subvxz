00:11.405 --> 00:14.125
Catriona Bailey sent
embedded information to China.

00:14.205 --> 00:18.205
Information given by Bailey, too,
was followed by a response from the US.

00:18.285 --> 00:20.085
You understand the importance
of keeping this

00:20.165 --> 00:22.685
-known at the highest levels only.
-Of course.

00:22.765 --> 00:26.645
US military action guarantees Markson's
death and we're compelled to join 'em.

00:27.485 --> 00:30.365
Keep your head down for a while.
Just wait till whatever it is blows over.

00:30.445 --> 00:33.245
Naakesh Rahimi is a CIA mole.

00:33.325 --> 00:36.045
You're going to tell the Haqqani
that you'll give up the identity

00:36.125 --> 00:39.445
of the CIA mole in their midst and in
return, they'll release Corporal Markson.

00:39.525 --> 00:43.005
The only way people are going to take
notice is if innocent people die here.

00:43.085 --> 00:44.805
Did they kill Connor to cover their lie?

00:44.885 --> 00:49.885
<i>You said you wanted the truth. I have it,</i>
<i>on a USB, all the evidence you need.</i>

00:49.965 --> 00:51.645
-Take it!

00:51.725 --> 00:53.165
-Shit.

00:53.965 --> 00:57.085
You've seen her records.
She had a lot of problems.

00:57.165 --> 01:02.485
<i>You stole fucking ADF weapons, Helen.</i>
<i>That's court-martial. That's treason.</i>

01:03.125 --> 01:04.685
Got a location on Markson.

01:05.325 --> 01:07.605
US are sending in a task force
to pick him up.

01:08.885 --> 01:09.925
All sorted?

01:12.285 --> 01:13.285
I believe so.

01:13.925 --> 01:15.525
There's still one loose end.

01:16.085 --> 01:17.005
I'll see to it.

01:17.405 --> 01:18.245
Good.

01:20.645 --> 01:23.365
<i>The first attack</i>
<i>by a foreign power on Australian soil</i>

01:23.445 --> 01:28.285
<i>in 77 years and the first causalities are</i>
<i>four innocent civilians, including...</i>

01:28.365 --> 01:30.405
<i>This is our worst fears realized.</i>

01:30.485 --> 01:33.485
<i>It's the sort of</i>
<i>nightmare that happens somewhere else...</i>

01:33.565 --> 01:36.205
<i>The question is how does</i>
<i>the prime minister respond?</i>

01:36.285 --> 01:38.845
<i>...Garrity got our backs?</i>
<i>Are we safe in our own...</i>

01:38.925 --> 01:41.125
<i>We don't forget</i>
<i>and we don't lie down.</i>

01:41.205 --> 01:43.325
<i>Ask the bloody Japanese. They'll tell you.</i>

02:03.485 --> 02:07.325
<i>Protestors descended</i>
<i>on the Pakistani embassy this morning,</i>

02:07.405 --> 02:10.085
<i>following last night's bombshell</i>
<i>from Ludie Sypek.</i>

02:10.445 --> 02:13.325
<i>Unnamed sources at the highest levels</i>
<i>have confirmed to me</i>

02:13.405 --> 02:16.365
<i>that the Davoren Park drone hack</i>
<i>has been traced</i>

02:16.445 --> 02:20.365
<i>to an internet service provider address</i>
<i>in Islamabad, Pakistan.</i>

02:21.045 --> 02:21.885
Who leaked this?

02:23.565 --> 02:26.125
I've put some feelers out in the gallery.
Nothing as yet.

02:26.845 --> 02:28.885
Do they have any idea
what they've unleashed?

02:32.005 --> 02:33.565
Are they trying to start a fucking war?

04:05.445 --> 04:07.645
If you want to leave me, I'd understand.

04:09.565 --> 04:11.165
-Is that what you want?

04:12.805 --> 04:13.645
No.

04:13.925 --> 04:15.405
I don't want to leave you, Helen.

04:16.645 --> 04:18.085
I just want my wife back.

04:27.485 --> 04:28.365
Helen...
phone.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.285
Where's she going?

04:59.885 --> 05:00.725
Rehab.

05:02.285 --> 05:03.205
Thirty days.

05:06.685 --> 05:07.965
What if it doesn't work?

05:08.485 --> 05:10.845
Then I'll keep turning myself inside out.

05:17.285 --> 05:18.285
Hey, Vaughn.

05:18.845 --> 05:19.805
Vaughn.

05:19.885 --> 05:23.005
Have you had a chance
to, uh, to analyze the USB yet?

05:24.245 --> 05:26.325
I have no idea what you're talking about,
Harriet.

05:26.405 --> 05:30.565
Cal Treloar, she had a USB on her last
night at the Carillon when she was killed.

05:31.245 --> 05:34.405
It should've gone to ASD,
so you could verify the flight data,

05:34.485 --> 05:36.645
proving that she hacked the drone.

05:37.125 --> 05:38.765
We don't have any USB.

05:39.045 --> 05:41.245
Well, who does?
Would it be ASIO or the Feds?

05:43.245 --> 05:44.925
Well... Hey, Vaughn.

06:20.885 --> 06:21.805
Hey, Mum.

06:34.885 --> 06:35.845
Oh, Mum.

06:38.445 --> 06:40.245
I just got home from night shift.

06:42.565 --> 06:43.805
I haven't touched anything.

06:45.885 --> 06:47.485
Do you know what they were looking for?

06:50.045 --> 06:50.885
Yeah.

06:52.165 --> 06:54.565
It's to do with her, isn't it? Cal.

06:56.445 --> 06:57.285
Yeah.

07:02.245 --> 07:04.285
What have you got yourself
caught up in, Harriet?

07:07.925 --> 07:11.245
In 48 hours, we'll have
completion on a forward-operating base,

07:11.325 --> 07:15.125
17 kilometers east of Khost,
near the Afghan border to Pakistan.

07:16.165 --> 07:20.445
Camp Bastion. US Special Forces
and advance troops are mobilizing

07:20.525 --> 07:22.445
for an assault on Haqqani as we speak.

07:22.525 --> 07:25.725
The Commander-in-Chief won't be waiting
for Congressional approval.

07:25.805 --> 07:26.845
There's precedent.

07:27.445 --> 07:29.965
He can invoke the alliance if he has to.

07:30.045 --> 07:31.565
Where are we at with Garrity?

07:32.565 --> 07:35.365
He's waiting on Joint Committee
and then it goes to Cabinet.

07:35.925 --> 07:37.565
Do we anticipate a problem?

07:37.645 --> 07:39.765
It's about hearts and minds, gentlemen,

07:39.845 --> 07:41.765
which is where our insurance comes in.

07:42.765 --> 07:46.005
Corporal Markson was put on a plane
out of Bagram Airfield three hours ago.

07:47.165 --> 07:49.045
Does the PM know about his condition?

07:51.685 --> 07:52.565
Not yet.

08:02.925 --> 08:06.045
Pakistan is not responsible
for any of this, Prime Minister.

08:06.125 --> 08:08.165
Are you saying you could
categorically assure me

08:08.245 --> 08:10.925
you know the full classified
working brief of the ISI?

08:11.005 --> 08:13.645
I'm saying that all my communications
with Islamabad,

08:13.725 --> 08:17.285
from the Prime Minister down,
confirm there was no UAV datalink hack...

08:17.565 --> 08:20.765
nor was there a missile strike
on Australian sovereign territory.

08:21.245 --> 08:24.165
An assurance that you cannot offer
my government in return.

08:24.245 --> 08:28.045
My government assures you we don't capture
and torture Pakistani military personnel

08:28.125 --> 08:30.685
-in breach of the Geneva Convention.
-Neither does my government.

08:30.765 --> 08:33.485
What you speak of is the responsibility
of the Haqqani.

08:33.965 --> 08:35.925
-Is there a difference?

08:36.005 --> 08:38.765
Is there a difference between
the Australian government,

08:38.845 --> 08:42.605
its American allies and the private
military corporation it employs?

08:45.605 --> 08:49.925
I have the voices of 25 million people in
my head at any one time, Mr. Ambassador.

08:50.005 --> 08:51.645
Some are louder than others,

08:51.725 --> 08:53.765
but all of them demanding to be heard.

08:58.925 --> 09:01.125
And somewhere in there,
amidst the noise...

09:02.645 --> 09:03.765
is my voice.

09:09.085 --> 09:10.805
And what is it saying, Prime Minister?

09:24.165 --> 09:26.565
I'll order a federal police detail
to be assigned your embassy.

09:32.485 --> 09:34.085
-Prime Minister.
-Mr. Ambassador.

09:40.045 --> 09:42.965
The evidence has been confirmed.
The case is compelling.

09:43.045 --> 09:45.885
The ISP has been verified now
by two independent sources,

09:45.965 --> 09:47.645
AFP and ASD.

09:47.725 --> 09:50.245
-Hellier didn't lean on their findings?

09:50.325 --> 09:52.085
I'm telling you, Karen. It was Cal.

09:52.165 --> 09:56.485
-Why else would she confess to me?
-Her medical record, history of PTSD.

09:56.565 --> 09:59.205
Why drop a bomb on her countrymen?
Makes no sense.

09:59.285 --> 10:02.245
-Because it was a misguided protest.
-To prove what?

10:02.325 --> 10:05.885
To prove that Western lives matter
more than Middle Eastern ones.

10:05.965 --> 10:08.165
That there's not enough outrage
to go around.

10:08.245 --> 10:12.445
So, she kills four innocent white people,
so we choke on our Corn Flakes and care?

10:12.525 --> 10:15.165
Look, like you say,
she wasn't in her right mind.

10:17.485 --> 10:20.085
Okay.
So, why should we believe her?

10:20.525 --> 10:22.205
Because there is a USB out there

10:22.285 --> 10:25.765
that proves the hack originated
from an ISP address in rural Canberra.

10:26.525 --> 10:28.925
-John Smith?
-AKA Connor MacPherson.

10:29.005 --> 10:31.565
-So, she had him hack her own drone?
-It was the perfect cover.

10:31.645 --> 10:33.965
But now they need to bury the proof
that it wasn't Pakistan.

10:34.045 --> 10:36.925
They just turned my mother's house
upside down looking for the USB.

10:37.565 --> 10:39.685
Now, while I try and track it down,

10:39.765 --> 10:43.045
the least you can do is just tell Garrity
that Cal has confessed.

10:43.125 --> 10:45.285
- Karen, we're starting.
-Yeah.

10:46.925 --> 10:49.285
Harri, I am not going to go to the PM

10:49.365 --> 10:52.005
about a critical matter
of national security, based on the word

10:52.085 --> 10:55.485
of a mentally-unstable drone pilot.
Not without proof.

10:55.565 --> 10:59.205
-But, Karen, I promise you that I saw it.
-Then find it. Yeah?

11:17.685 --> 11:19.085
Her personal effects.

11:22.365 --> 11:24.485
Did they tell you we're giving her
a military funeral?

11:25.365 --> 11:27.565
When things have... quietened down a bit.

11:30.085 --> 11:31.005
That's it?

11:35.285 --> 11:36.605
She had nothing else on her.

11:51.805 --> 11:52.645
Lieutenant...

11:54.645 --> 11:55.645
we got him back.

11:58.045 --> 11:59.085
Markson?

12:01.765 --> 12:02.605
Is he okay?

12:03.085 --> 12:04.325
The report's not good.

12:05.245 --> 12:06.565
I need to be there when he lands.

12:22.085 --> 12:25.525
- When's Markson due to land?
-Wheels down 1600.

12:28.885 --> 12:30.245
Is it permanent?

12:31.125 --> 12:32.525
Too early to know for sure, sir.

12:35.885 --> 12:37.005
I want to be there.

12:37.965 --> 12:38.885
Yes, sir.

12:45.445 --> 12:46.325
Oh, and, Wes...

12:48.765 --> 12:50.165
I don't want Hellier there.

12:54.725 --> 12:55.565
Sir.

13:09.805 --> 13:12.805
This might be tougher than we thought.

13:34.565 --> 13:35.925
Oh, my God.

13:36.325 --> 13:37.365
Gav...

13:37.925 --> 13:39.725
Hey, it's me.

13:40.885 --> 13:41.925
Gav...

13:42.645 --> 13:45.205
It's okay. You're home now. You're safe.

13:47.325 --> 13:48.285
Gav...

13:50.165 --> 13:53.205
We've got 48 hours till the Joint
Committee vote, followed by Cabinet.

13:53.285 --> 13:54.765
Until then this stays classified.

13:57.165 --> 13:59.365
Brief the wife. No one's to know
Markson's in the country

13:59.445 --> 14:01.805
until a physical and psychological
assessment's been made.

14:01.885 --> 14:03.485
-Do you understand?
-Yes, sir.

14:04.285 --> 14:06.045
Let's hope your minister does, too.

14:09.005 --> 14:10.485
What the hell have they done to him?

14:30.445 --> 14:31.405
Hey.

14:42.085 --> 14:44.085
This gets out,
the public are going to want blood.

14:45.005 --> 14:49.045
One of their own...
tortured, turned into a vegetable.

14:49.125 --> 14:51.165
It's like a red rag to a bull.

14:51.245 --> 14:53.645
It's classified. It's not getting out.

14:55.245 --> 14:57.405
Well, why would you disobey
a command to tell me?

15:00.325 --> 15:01.925
It's on me... all of it.

15:02.885 --> 15:04.845
Markson, Clemens, Cal.

15:20.165 --> 15:21.965
What does the inscription say?

15:23.485 --> 15:24.485
It's Latin.

15:25.845 --> 15:27.925
It means, through adversity to the stars.

15:29.165 --> 15:30.325
The RAAF motto.

15:33.045 --> 15:34.085
The stars.

15:35.925 --> 15:39.485
That's Defense for you.
Promise the world, deliver an atlas.

15:48.165 --> 15:49.965
Is that all you got from the morgue?

15:52.365 --> 15:53.965
Cal's USB didn't make it?

15:54.645 --> 15:55.845
Not according to Lockwood.

15:57.805 --> 15:58.885
Do you believe him?

16:17.525 --> 16:20.165
What if Cal's confession
never sees the light of day?

16:21.725 --> 16:22.765
What if...

16:23.805 --> 16:27.725
What if the Joint Committee vote in favor
of Pakistan hacking the drone?

16:29.445 --> 16:31.325
What if you have to go back there
and fight?

16:39.525 --> 16:41.565
<i>In the councils of government,</i>
<i>we must guard against the acquisition</i>

16:43.765 --> 16:47.485
<i>of unwarranted influence,</i>

16:51.045 --> 16:56.805
<i>The potential for the disastrous rise of</i>

<i>Ms. Koutoufides.</i>

17:33.805 --> 17:34.805
Mr. Lavelle.

17:37.205 --> 17:39.245
Please, uh, have a seat.

17:42.605 --> 17:43.685
Sweet kids.

17:48.645 --> 17:51.205
I've just come
from Senator Abboud's office.

17:52.845 --> 17:55.325
He tells me the committee's
split down the middle.

17:57.285 --> 17:59.485
Those meetings are supposed to be
<i>in camera.</i>

17:59.565 --> 18:01.685
Well, you know what politicians are like.

18:01.765 --> 18:03.765
Yes, I am one.

18:03.845 --> 18:06.205
Yes, but you're not like the rest of them.

18:06.285 --> 18:09.765
Abboud, Warneke, Crawley and Edmonds,

18:09.845 --> 18:11.685
they're a different breed.

18:12.565 --> 18:15.045
When push comes to shove,
they lack your conviction.

18:15.125 --> 18:15.965
Right.

18:16.925 --> 18:19.645
I don't suppose
it's too much of a coincidence

18:19.725 --> 18:22.885
that you just named
the four members of my voting bloc?

18:22.965 --> 18:26.725
My understanding is that
the numbers are... changing.

18:27.085 --> 18:29.285
Like I said, they lack conviction.

18:29.765 --> 18:33.365
And even if they didn't,
you'd still be one short.

18:34.405 --> 18:36.405
Is it really worth
putting your neck on the line?

18:39.085 --> 18:41.005
Is this about the photos, Mr. Lavelle?

18:41.525 --> 18:42.725
Photos?

18:42.805 --> 18:45.005
Mm. With Alex Berezin...

18:45.845 --> 18:47.885
Because I'm not afraid
of them being released.

18:47.965 --> 18:49.165
Why should you be?

18:49.645 --> 18:50.965
We're all grown-ups here.

19:00.925 --> 19:03.325
Thank you for your time, Ms. Koutoufides.

19:12.365 --> 19:13.565
What'd he want?

19:14.205 --> 19:15.125
My vote.

19:16.405 --> 19:17.525
So, he hasn't got it?

19:20.245 --> 19:21.565
Especially now.

19:46.045 --> 19:48.405
<i>Hello, Arlo. Do you want to play a game?</i>

19:48.965 --> 19:50.725
<i>Say, yes, Mr. Rabbit.</i>

19:51.325 --> 19:52.765
<i>Yes, Mr. Rabbit.</i>

20:45.965 --> 20:47.205
I can't accept this.

20:52.645 --> 20:54.405
I'm afraid my mind's made up, sir.
Is someone leaning on you, Vaughn?

20:57.925 --> 20:59.805
No, Prime Minister.

21:01.685 --> 21:03.445
My wife's a recovering...

21:04.645 --> 21:06.245
relapsing addict.

21:08.165 --> 21:11.445
I don't want to place you and the
government in an invidious position.

21:13.085 --> 21:13.925
Drugs?

21:14.645 --> 21:15.765
Gambling.

21:15.845 --> 21:18.085
She's currently
in treatment at a facility.

21:22.765 --> 21:25.565
I need this to stay between us
until after the vote.

21:40.285 --> 21:42.565
What's the cloak and dagger, Griff?

21:45.565 --> 21:47.765
You, uh... You ever read any E.M. Forster?

21:48.685 --> 21:50.685
-What, his novels or...?
-No, the essays.

21:51.445 --> 21:52.925
<i>Two Cheers for Democracy.</i>

21:53.565 --> 21:56.445
Because, let's face it,
who can summon a third?

21:56.805 --> 21:58.445
You got something for me, Griff?

22:01.005 --> 22:02.885
Do you think I was a good journalist?

22:04.685 --> 22:06.885
I think you always had
a nose for bullshit.

22:08.925 --> 22:11.805
And then you joined Bailey
and you started wearing it like a cologne.

22:14.365 --> 22:17.365
This, uh... secret little investigation
of yours--

22:17.445 --> 22:18.845
Listen, you know something?

22:20.445 --> 22:22.005
The morning after Davoren Park...

22:23.485 --> 22:25.885
-Bailey had a meeting up here.
-Okay, with who?

22:25.965 --> 22:27.525
- <i>Ms. Bailey.</i>

22:27.605 --> 22:30.325
<i>This will be a short meeting,</i>
<i>Mr. Lavelle.</i>

22:31.565 --> 22:34.485
<i>I know what you people are up to</i>
<i>and I know what you've done.</i>

22:34.565 --> 22:37.885
<i>I know about Pale Horse and Davoren Park.</i>

22:37.965 --> 22:41.565
<i>And I also know about your secret soldier,</i>

22:41.645 --> 22:44.765
<i>who's digging up skeletons</i>
<i>in the Defense Department.</i>

22:44.845 --> 22:46.325
<i>It ends now.</i>

22:46.725 --> 22:48.925
<i>I'm afraid that's impossible,</i>
<i>Minister.</i>

22:49.765 --> 22:52.845
<i>You don't get to decide that,</i>
<i>Mr. Lavelle. I do.</i>

22:53.405 --> 22:55.925
<i>Now, shut it down or I tell the PM.</i>

22:57.245 --> 22:59.485
So, Lavelle shut Bailey down instead, huh?

23:02.525 --> 23:05.565
The... the secret soldier,
you got any idea who it is?

23:09.005 --> 23:10.405
What are you going to do with that?

23:11.325 --> 23:14.045
Well, this is currency.
I'm going to spend it.

23:36.685 --> 23:38.085
What do you want, Harriet?

23:43.885 --> 23:47.685
That's... That's the document
that the Rabbit sent Mina Almasi

23:47.765 --> 23:49.445
and I need it unredacted.

23:49.725 --> 23:53.245
-I can't do this. It's illegal.
-It's never stopped you before, Vaughn.

23:55.205 --> 23:58.125
Bailey knew someone
was digging up skeletons in Defense,

23:58.205 --> 24:01.445
someone that she called
the secret soldier, working for Lavelle.

24:01.525 --> 24:04.485
And you think the secret soldier
is one of these redacted names?

24:06.525 --> 24:07.805
No, I think it's the Rabbit.

24:10.885 --> 24:13.485
This is classified... Level Three.

24:14.565 --> 24:17.285
Well, you can access anything,
'cause you're the head of ASD.

24:18.365 --> 24:19.365
Not for long.

24:19.965 --> 24:21.205
What's going on?

24:21.925 --> 24:23.565
I've given my notice to the PM.

24:29.805 --> 24:33.085
That's why you signed off
on the drone hack being Pakistan?

24:33.765 --> 24:36.125
Trebuchet is blackmailing you
over your wife.

24:37.725 --> 24:39.045
The rot set in, Harriet...

24:40.005 --> 24:41.085
and I'm part of it.

24:43.485 --> 24:47.125
<i>My special guests tonight are</i>
<i>Corporal Gavin Markson</i>

24:47.205 --> 24:50.285
<i>and his wife, Kirsty.</i>
<i>Thank you so much for coming in, Kirsty,</i>

24:50.365 --> 24:52.045
<i>-I really appreciate it.</i>
<i>-You're welcome.</i>

24:52.125 --> 24:54.485
<i>I should say</i>
<i>that Kirsty Markson is here tonight</i>

24:54.565 --> 24:57.725
<i>in defiance</i>
<i>of ADF confidentiality protocols.</i>

24:57.805 --> 25:02.085
<i>Kirsty, could you please tell us</i>
<i>about your husband's condition?</i>

25:03.405 --> 25:06.245
<i>His skull suffered multiple fractures.</i>

25:07.205 --> 25:08.765
<i>When you look at the MRI,</i>

25:08.845 --> 25:12.085
<i>you can't tell where one crack ends</i>
<i>and the next begins.</i>

25:12.765 --> 25:14.165
<i>I told the doctors...</i>

25:14.805 --> 25:17.845
<i>if there's nothing</i>
<i>that you can do for him...</i>

25:19.445 --> 25:20.725
<i>then he's coming home...</i>

25:22.045 --> 25:23.445
<i>where he's loved...</i>

25:24.645 --> 25:27.645
<i>surrounded by his... his memories.</i>

25:29.405 --> 25:32.565
<i>Kirsty, do you know who did this to him?</i>

25:35.565 --> 25:36.525
<i>Haqqani.</i>

25:37.325 --> 25:38.445
<i>Pakistan.</i>

25:39.645 --> 25:40.885
<i>The US government.</i>

25:42.085 --> 25:43.445
<i>The Australian government.</i>

25:45.485 --> 25:47.565
- <i>It's okay.</i>

25:47.645 --> 25:48.805
<i>No.</i>

25:49.485 --> 25:51.245
<i>It's not okay.</i>

25:51.965 --> 25:54.405
<i>And it'll never be okay. </i>

25:54.485 --> 25:57.005
<i>My beautiful husband,</i>

25:57.085 --> 26:00.045
<i>the father of my child, he went away...</i>

26:01.965 --> 26:03.405
<i>...and he didn't come home.</i>

26:06.365 --> 26:08.525
We're trying to get to the bottom
of how this got out.

26:15.245 --> 26:17.005
Are you at the bottom of this, Jim?

26:18.445 --> 26:20.245
Did you go to Ludie Sypek with this?

26:21.965 --> 26:24.325
Ludie called my office
when the story went viral

26:24.405 --> 26:25.925
-on social media--
-How'd that happen?

26:27.885 --> 26:31.045
-Like I said, I'm looking into it.
-Spare me the bullshit, Jim.
I won't stand by
and watch you gut the alliance.

26:41.085 --> 26:44.005
You want to nick yourself... go ahead.

26:44.085 --> 26:48.365
So, now we're coming
to the sharp end of the knife, are we, mm?

26:49.165 --> 26:52.645
You can get on board, Ewan,
or you can squeal like a stuck pig.

26:54.165 --> 26:55.205
It's up to you.

28:08.205 --> 28:11.365
You know sleep deprivation's
a form of torture, right?

28:11.445 --> 28:15.565
So, Lockwood was part
of the cover-up in Ar-Rutbah.

28:16.485 --> 28:17.365
-What?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

28:17.445 --> 28:19.845
<i>I got the classified</i>
<i>action report unredacted.</i>

28:20.325 --> 28:24.645
Listen, do you know
a soldier called Gattuso?

28:25.365 --> 28:26.965
<i>Captain Vincent Gattuso?</i>

28:27.725 --> 28:30.565
He was SAS, First Squadron, Iraq.
Did you know him?

28:32.845 --> 28:33.685
I did.

28:34.405 --> 28:36.045
<i>Do you know</i>
<i>where I could find him?</i>

28:36.725 --> 28:41.645
<i>Six feet under. Chinook chopper</i>
<i>went down in Kandahar... 2010.</i>

28:43.045 --> 28:46.405
<i>Lockwood's not going to talk to me</i>
<i>and the other name's withheld.</i>

29:05.845 --> 29:06.965
Okay.

29:07.045 --> 29:12.005
So, Gattuso gave the order to open fire
on four suspected insurgents,

29:12.085 --> 29:14.205
as they were trying to flee a compound
in a vehicle.

29:14.805 --> 29:18.725
When they realized it was Mina's mother
and father and husband and her son,

29:18.805 --> 29:21.165
they planted weapons on the dead bodies

29:21.245 --> 29:24.405
and then Lockwood called in an air strike
to cover their tracks.

29:24.485 --> 29:25.645
And how do you know all this?

29:29.725 --> 29:32.645
They set Mina up.
I mean, somebody who knew about that

29:32.725 --> 29:36.765
and someone who knew how to push the
buttons of a grieving, traumatized woman.

29:37.245 --> 29:39.445
They did the deed
and then Mina took the fall for it.

29:39.965 --> 29:42.045
-Why would they redact "withheld name"?

29:42.965 --> 29:45.965
-I want to talk to Lockwood.
-You won't even get past the front desk.

29:46.045 --> 29:48.405
-But maybe if you came with me.
-He's the Chief of Defense.

29:48.485 --> 29:50.165
Yeah, but he's up to his neck in this.

29:51.205 --> 29:52.525
Joe, the vote is tomorrow.

29:53.085 --> 29:56.085
If we sit back and do nothing,
then we go to war.

29:56.645 --> 29:57.725
You go to war...

29:58.325 --> 30:00.645
and I don't think
that you should be going.

30:00.725 --> 30:02.805
I work for the Defense Department.
I don't get a say.

30:02.885 --> 30:04.205
This isn't about defense.

30:04.485 --> 30:06.685
There's no enemy.
We haven't been attacked.

30:06.765 --> 30:09.925
-So you were at the safe house, were you?
-It's about revenge.

30:10.005 --> 30:12.085
-Don't tell me what it's about!
-For Clemens, Markson--

30:12.165 --> 30:14.085
You have no idea
what it's like over there, Harri.

30:15.005 --> 30:18.685
It's fucking Old Testament.
It's the Bible with guns. Okay?
Outside the wire, surrounded by enemy,
all hell breaking loose around you.

30:24.565 --> 30:27.485
You're in over your head. Drop it, Harri.

31:25.405 --> 31:26.885
Do you want me to call the police?

31:27.685 --> 31:28.885
Can I come in?

31:29.365 --> 31:30.845
Why would I let you in?

31:31.685 --> 31:34.565
Because I know you were part
of the cover-up in Ar-Rutbah.

31:54.285 --> 31:55.605
It's not the only copy.

31:57.325 --> 31:58.365
Where'd you get it?

32:00.045 --> 32:02.965
Did you kill Catriona Bailey,
Air Chief Marshall?

32:03.365 --> 32:05.365
Oh, Christ.

32:08.885 --> 32:10.485
Why would I do that?

32:11.165 --> 32:13.965
Because she called a press conference
the night that she was murdered,

32:14.045 --> 32:17.965
where she planned to announce
an ADFG inquiry into Ar-Rutbah.

32:18.885 --> 32:22.685
But she got spooked by Davoren Park
and threatened to shut down Pale Horse.

32:24.805 --> 32:26.205
Because she was a traitor...

32:27.845 --> 32:30.165
and blew the cover on your safe house
in Miramshah...

32:30.565 --> 32:33.405
getting your boy Clemens killed
and Markson captured.

32:35.165 --> 32:37.685
Who else besides you
had clearance level access

32:37.765 --> 32:39.845
to that kind of confidential information?

32:42.485 --> 32:44.085
I don't answer to you, Harriet.

32:45.885 --> 32:47.245
So, who do you answer to?

32:48.565 --> 32:49.565
Pentagon?

32:50.965 --> 32:51.885
Trebuchet?

32:53.165 --> 32:55.165
Trebuchet's turned this town upside down

32:55.245 --> 32:57.845
looking for Cal's USB,
so why have you kept it to yourself?

32:58.925 --> 33:02.805
What's the point in a secret army
that the Chief of Defense doesn't trust?

33:02.885 --> 33:05.605
We live in an outsourced world, Harriet.

33:07.485 --> 33:08.525
You can't fight it.

33:09.205 --> 33:11.205
Comes with the territory.

33:12.925 --> 33:16.205
It's deep state, accountable to no one...

33:18.845 --> 33:22.885
with its own ideas
about the national interest.

33:26.005 --> 33:27.765
Just tell me where it is.

33:53.485 --> 33:54.565
Tell her where it is, Wes.

33:56.365 --> 34:00.085
-Enough, Berezin.  No more.
-You're the secret soldier.

34:01.565 --> 34:04.445
Served together in Iraq. Ar-Rutbah.

34:06.285 --> 34:07.205
You killed Bailey?

34:09.165 --> 34:14.244
John Smith, Connor MacPherson, yes.
Bailey, no. Didn't need to.

34:17.605 --> 34:19.684
Now, tell her where the USB is, Wes.

34:20.885 --> 34:22.125
I don't have it.

34:28.085 --> 34:29.485
It's on the bookshelf.

34:29.965 --> 34:31.005
The shell casing.

34:33.445 --> 34:34.565
The one on the right.

34:49.965 --> 34:51.125
Now, give it to me, Harriet.

35:00.845 --> 35:02.325
Drop it. Harriet, go!

35:02.685 --> 35:04.045
-On the floor.

35:20.325 --> 35:21.325
Close the door.

35:34.925 --> 35:36.725
-Morning.
-Morning.

35:37.485 --> 35:38.805
Ready for D-Day?

35:41.045 --> 35:42.085
We are now.

35:49.285 --> 35:51.645
Well, I think we understand
the ramifications

35:51.725 --> 35:53.845
of the investigation we've had before us.

35:54.285 --> 35:58.485
However, in the absence
of verifiable evidence to the contrary...

35:58.965 --> 36:00.125
I would like to propose

36:00.205 --> 36:03.805
the finding of the Joint Committee
for Intelligence and Security

36:03.885 --> 36:09.685
into Agenda Item 467311-A,
that the cyber-security breach

36:09.765 --> 36:13.365
of Pale Horse AOD Nine
was an act of aggression

36:13.445 --> 36:16.605
-by Pakistani intelligence agency, ISI...

36:16.685 --> 36:20.485
...in retaliation
for the death of General Nazir.

36:21.685 --> 36:25.885
Now, before I take a formal vote
on the proposed recommendations

36:25.965 --> 36:29.485
to Prime Minister and Cabinet,
are there any final submissions?

36:29.565 --> 36:31.365
If I may. Thanks, Gaelene.

36:32.885 --> 36:36.045
Uh...
If I could please draw your attention

36:36.125 --> 36:37.685
-to the mon--

36:39.125 --> 36:40.365
Excuse me.

36:40.445 --> 36:41.565
...the monitor.

36:43.925 --> 36:48.765
Karen... do you have anything
or should we proceed with the vote?

36:51.765 --> 36:53.845
-What? Is it over?
- No.

36:54.485 --> 36:55.485
Did you show them?

36:56.445 --> 36:59.005
-Karen, what happened with the vote?
-I abstained.

37:08.285 --> 37:10.485
They're threatening
my little boy, Harriet. I can't.

37:11.805 --> 37:14.445
-I can't. No! No!
-Karen, it's...

37:15.845 --> 37:18.645
Mum, it's me. Is Arlo there?

37:19.965 --> 37:20.925
Yeah.

37:27.565 --> 37:30.125
<i>The Pakistani Ambassador,</i>
<i>Yasir Younis,</i>

37:30.205 --> 37:31.965
<i>was expelled from the embassy</i>

37:32.045 --> 37:35.845
<i>in Canberra today,</i>
<i>along with 20 diplomatic staff,</i>

37:35.925 --> 37:40.725
<i>officially issued a persona non grata</i>
<i>censure by Prime Minister Garrity,</i>

37:40.805 --> 37:45.645
<i>in response to the torture of commando</i>
<i>soldier Corporal Gavin Markson.</i>

37:46.125 --> 37:49.045
Pakistan's just expelled
our ambassador from Islamabad.

37:51.085 --> 37:52.245
The die is cast.

37:53.365 --> 37:54.965
I'm not sure it is, Prime Minister.

37:59.045 --> 38:01.125
Almost 60 years ago,

38:01.205 --> 38:05.045
a US president, former general, no less,
warned us about this.

38:06.565 --> 38:11.165
The ADF, NSC, AFP, ASD and the Joint
Committee, they've all signed off on it.

38:11.805 --> 38:15.405
Cabinet's waiting now
with its rubber stamp...

38:15.485 --> 38:17.405
obedient, eager to please.

38:18.365 --> 38:21.765
But if I take this to them...

38:23.405 --> 38:24.485
they'll just bury it.

38:26.205 --> 38:27.325
But how can they?

38:28.125 --> 38:30.365
Because history teaches us nothing,
Harriet.

38:34.165 --> 38:35.725
Cabinet's ready for you, Prime Minister.

38:47.445 --> 38:48.925
I'm not your answer, Harriet.

38:50.125 --> 38:51.885
I've been at the helm for too many lies.

38:53.245 --> 38:55.045
Davoren Park, Pale Horse...

38:55.885 --> 38:56.845
Corporal Markson...

38:58.565 --> 39:00.645
If I'm the author of this one,
it won't play.

39:05.245 --> 39:06.485
I'm part of the problem.

39:09.885 --> 39:11.005
You need to get it out there.

39:14.405 --> 39:16.165
It's time for a little anarchy.

39:18.125 --> 39:21.925
And when you do,
I'll call a Royal Commission.

39:24.045 --> 39:28.005
Our government will fall and I'll be
a despised footnote in history, but...

39:29.885 --> 39:31.565
this time, I'll have a say in it.

39:48.565 --> 39:51.405
<i>Australian Special Forces</i>
<i>troops have been called up</i>

39:51.485 --> 39:53.565
<i>for immediate deployment to Pakistan,</i>

39:53.645 --> 39:56.005
<i>following today’s historic vote</i>
<i>by Cabinet.</i>

39:56.445 --> 39:59.245
<i>I’ve spoken to the President</i>
<i>and informed him,</i>
<i>along with the leader of the opposition</i>
<i>and the Governor General...</i>

40:02.645 --> 40:04.405
<i>of my government’s decision to join</i>

40:04.485 --> 40:07.165
<i>our great friends and allies,</i>
<i>the United States.</i>

40:07.725 --> 40:09.685
<i>It will be a joint military operation,</i>

40:09.765 --> 40:13.045
<i>the details of which will not be</i>
<i>made public for security reasons.</i>

40:13.405 --> 40:16.565
<i>But at this time,</i>
<i>I offer the brave men and women</i>
<i>of our defense forces</i>
<i>our thoughts and prayers</i>

40:19.885 --> 40:22.245
<i>on behalf of the Australian people.</i>

40:23.725 --> 40:27.405
In light of the criminal charges
laid in the past 24 hours

40:27.485 --> 40:32.245
against registered lobbyist Alex Berezin,
Prime Minister Garrity and I would like

40:32.325 --> 40:36.445
to announce the removal of Vanguard Energy
as a commercial partner...

40:37.005 --> 40:38.925
-in the Wakefield Solar Plant.

40:39.765 --> 40:43.165
<i>Mina Almasi has now been</i>
<i>released from Maconochie Prison</i>

40:43.245 --> 40:45.245
<i>and cleared of all charges.</i>

40:48.045 --> 40:49.645
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

40:49.725 --> 40:50.885
- Huh?
- Mm.

41:12.805 --> 41:15.365
You know, the Rabbit told me
that he didn't kill Bailey.

41:16.405 --> 41:18.525
He said he could have,
but he didn't have to.

41:24.165 --> 41:25.165
What are you saying?

41:27.005 --> 41:30.485
I'm saying I think there's nothing
a mother of a murdered child wouldn't do.

42:20.365 --> 42:22.405
-Hello.
- <i>It's ready.</i>

42:24.805 --> 42:27.165
By the time they shut it down,
half the devices in the country

42:27.245 --> 42:30.245
will have got it...
and they'll send it to the other half.

42:33.845 --> 42:34.925
Then let's do it.

42:59.245 --> 43:00.845
<i>My name is Caroline Treloar.</i>

43:02.285 --> 43:06.565
<i>I'm a UAV pilot for private military</i>
<i>contractor Trebuchet Corporation.</i>

43:07.485 --> 43:09.165
<i>And I'm responsible for the death</i>

43:09.245 --> 43:12.405
<i>of four innocent people in Davoren Park</i>
<i>on April 12th.</i>

43:14.525 --> 43:18.565
<i>This was a deliberate act, made to look</i>
<i>like an external datalink systems hack...</i>

43:19.205 --> 43:22.005
<i>the evidence of which is contained</i>
<i>on this USB</i>

43:22.085 --> 43:24.805
<i>and a shadow data brick,</i>
<i>buried at these coordinates.</i>

43:26.205 --> 43:31.325
<i>I committed this act as a protest against</i>
<i>the black ops Pale Horse program</i>

43:31.405 --> 43:33.885
<i>and the taking</i>
<i>of innocent lives in Pakistan.</i>

43:39.125 --> 43:40.205
<i>Where does it end?</i>

43:43.565 --> 43:47.685
<i>Do we really think we hold our loved ones</i>
<i>closer than our enemies do?</i>

43:53.005 --> 43:55.645
<i>Why would our grief hurt more than theirs?</i>

44:09.205 --> 44:12.365
<i>An eye for an eye</i>
<i>and the whole world goes blind.</i>
