02:02.320 --> 02:05.403
Often when he just a boy
 Harry Papadopoulos

02:05.640 --> 02:07.608
Came to this country with nothing.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.746
Harry was a grofter,

02:09.771 --> 02:11.756
entering the restaurant
trade as a young man.

02:12.640 --> 02:15.167
Must've used Euphemismus,
for Greek waiter isn't he?

02:16.520 --> 02:17.521
Only joking Harry.

02:18.560 --> 02:21.294
He then started the now
famous Papadopoulos

02:21.320 --> 02:23.307
& Sons, doing all things Greek.

02:23.480 --> 02:27.610
From Taramasalata to olive oil
and Frozen-Moussaka.

02:28.240 --> 02:31.289
Which I must admit my wife and I are
a partial to in occasion.

02:31.480 --> 02:35.041
Not one to settle, Harry's made the move
in to comercial property.

02:35.400 --> 02:38.131
Where he's about to embark on
one of the most audacious development yet.

02:38.057 --> 02:40.331
Papadopoulos Plaza.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.736
A 2 Million square
foot redevelopment

02:43.762 --> 02:46.065

Touch the vase.

03:46.440 --> 03:47.805

03:56.200 --> 03:58.166

03:58.892 --> 03:59.832
Hmm... I don't know.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.081
Derek? you must remember him.
He's been in to the house.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.931
It's because they're all so dull
- Wait...

04:07.280 --> 04:09.965
Gold doing well, Tech stocks down.

04:10.160 --> 04:13.926

04:25.560 --> 04:28.450

Cheers man, thank you.

04:38.040 --> 04:40.195

Papadopoulos & sons

04:40.221 --> 04:42.195
borrow for property development?

04:42.360 --> 04:43.361
300 Million.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.878
Never mind the trial
and tribulation at the stock market.

04:45.904 --> 04:48.233
Finish your supper young man.

04:48.720 --> 04:49.553
Nanny P!

04:49.579 --> 04:52.909
Eat up, or there's no
pudding, I made you a sponge

04:53.120 --> 04:56.329
Two, four, eight, sixteen...
- Alright.

04:56.680 --> 04:58.808
32, 64, 128...
- That's enough.

04:59.400 --> 05:02.735
Something is happening with
Interbank London daddy!

05:02.761 --> 05:04.556
Alright we'll talk about it tomorow.

05:04.720 --> 05:06.370
Gonna be a long summer.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.551
Dating into a business award

05:08.577 --> 05:11.153
ceremony is hardly
a family day out

05:13.280 --> 05:16.648
My suggest was
a Cottage in Lime Regis.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.950
Dave, I need to
talk to you about James.

05:24.440 --> 05:27.603
It's a... look, you really should be
doing that out in the back!

05:27.840 --> 05:29.251
Yeah, sorry.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.101
Look, it's a..
He needs to

05:32.127 --> 05:34.713
complete his degree. And this..

05:35.280 --> 05:37.906
...gardening, the
hortyculture, the plants...

05:37.932 --> 05:38.673
Yeah yeah.

05:39.200 --> 05:41.202
It's a huge distraction.

05:42.080 --> 05:45.073
I was just opening
my own show the older days

05:45.099 --> 05:47.236
Yeah well, I need him to study,
and you're diverting his attention.

05:48.760 --> 05:50.569
And frankly it's
not what I pay you for.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.421
Please don't be so childish.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.951
You know, if you work for my
company, you probably be fired

05:59.177 --> 06:00.034
Yeah.

06:01.720 --> 06:05.202
Is anything else?
- No, that's it.

06:06.520 --> 06:09.000
Good night, Mr. Papadopoulos.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.090
James?

06:16.200 --> 06:17.725
Relax.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.321
Calm down.

06:21.640 --> 06:23.449
You need to learn how to...

06:24.400 --> 06:26.940
You really need to learn how to
express your self more calm..

06:26.866 --> 06:28.050
Wanker.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.643
Wanker!

06:41.840 --> 06:44.127
James, can I come in?

07:00.600 --> 07:04.366
"It's not the strongest to survive
nor the most intelegent,

07:04.720 --> 07:08.122
but those adaptable to change."

07:08.760 --> 07:11.127
Facinating. Charles Darwin.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.727
Aw, look at that!

07:21.760 --> 07:23.125
And that's...

07:23.440 --> 07:25.861
Did you know, that
the average garden

07:26.087 --> 07:28.868
contains over 3,5
million species?

07:29.920 --> 07:31.649
No, I didn't.

07:36.320 --> 07:38.384
Dad, I'm not going back to...

07:38.410 --> 07:40.689
But it's only a year,
and then you got a law degree.

07:41.640 --> 07:44.530
I have no intention of running...

07:48.760 --> 07:51.331
Papadopoulos & Sons.

07:52.640 --> 07:56.122
I can't even pronounce it.
- Look..

07:58.760 --> 08:03.084
Finish your studies.
The plants, it's a hobby sure.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.527
Give your self options, you may
change your mind about the business.

08:07.720 --> 08:10.478
You know there're lot of
creative borrow now in business.

08:10.504 --> 08:11.192
Like what?

08:17.200 --> 08:18.804
Like marketing.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.890
Alright, differ the far new year.

08:25.120 --> 08:27.646
Take a year off. Why not.
Fine.

08:28.200 --> 08:31.443
But don't quit.
Your mother would've said the same.

08:31.720 --> 08:32.960
Will she?

08:33.159 --> 08:35.457
Well your mother would
probably just said do what

08:35.484 --> 08:37.873
you feel was right. But I
doubt if she was wrong.

08:38.760 --> 08:42.559
And then we'd argue probably,
and she win.

08:44.080 --> 08:46.048
That was your mother.

08:47.760 --> 08:50.730
At least consider differing.

08:55.600 --> 08:59.127
Ok. I'll consider differing.

09:00.480 --> 09:02.767
Yeah? Great.

09:07.120 --> 09:08.565
Great.

09:08.960 --> 09:12.009
So there you are,
it's not a definitely not.

09:17.400 --> 09:20.483
What's this one called?
- It's an Ivy.

09:27.280 --> 09:28.725
Mrs. P?

09:34.960 --> 09:36.485
Mrs. P.

09:40.400 --> 09:42.243
Look, I'd better...

09:43.000 --> 09:44.240
Hey

09:46.400 --> 09:48.528
Well done for...

09:50.960 --> 09:52.644
You know.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.290
Close it?

10:02.720 --> 10:04.085
Yes, please.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.911
Evening boss, sorry to disturb.
I work for homeless charity.

10:08.937 --> 10:09.653
Sorry, no thanks.

10:10.320 --> 10:13.449
Dishclothes?
- I know how you people up right.

10:13.600 --> 10:16.683
I've got a bagde.
- Not a mention of a charity.

10:17.440 --> 10:20.489
Come on, boss. Give us a break.
Trying to earn a living here.

10:20.680 --> 10:23.356
Look I got tea towels,
service cleaners,

10:23.382 --> 10:25.666
scrubbers, brushes,
window sprays,

10:26.080 --> 10:28.048
shammies for drawer in a car...

10:29.040 --> 10:31.327
Cars.
- Daddy, you need to see the news!

10:32.000 --> 10:33.729
Hello there, Mini-Boss.

10:34.280 --> 10:35.265
Who's that man?

10:35.891 --> 10:38.788
He's a... he works for charity.

10:39.960 --> 10:42.531
Is it a cake sale?
- Cakes?

10:42.680 --> 10:44.808
Did you say cakes?
Did he say cakes?

10:45.800 --> 10:47.747
How did you know, that's
what I wanna do. Open up a cake shop.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.399
Cakes! Really?

10:49.400 --> 10:51.676
Cup Cakes, individually
decorated ginger man,

10:51.702 --> 10:53.375
bite size apple strudle,

10:53.440 --> 10:55.488
gooey fudge ball, mini-muffins...

10:56.280 --> 10:57.301
It's what they sell
at traditional fair.

10:57.326 --> 10:59.119
Got business plan and everything.

10:59.120 --> 11:01.168
It will be egalitarian,

11:01.440 --> 11:04.967
but feel... exclusive.

11:05.920 --> 11:07.206
So my mission statement really:

11:07.760 --> 11:09.190
"Progressive people's cake shop",

11:09.516 --> 11:11.710
for progressive pricein'.

11:12.040 --> 11:15.726
Very good. I know about a thing or two
about food business as well.

11:15.920 --> 11:19.288
Really? I'm looking for investors.
- Retail's not for me I'm affraid.

11:19.480 --> 11:21.208
Staff, nightmare, they'll
nick your cake upside

11:21.234 --> 11:23.032
your costumer and do you
for own food dissmisal.

11:23.360 --> 11:25.727
Ah. Thanks for the encouragement.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.721
Lets buy something!
The news, Daddy!

11:34.160 --> 11:35.650
How much for a...

11:37.960 --> 11:40.008
Its a shammy.
- What ever, how much?

11:40.320 --> 11:42.527
Shammy?
It's a shammy.

11:43.200 --> 11:45.726
I'm not gonna say that word.
- Why not?

11:45.960 --> 11:49.726
Because its a silly word,
and don't know what it's for,

11:50.120 --> 11:52.646
and I don't know if you're genuine.

11:52.800 --> 11:54.723
And I probably never gonna use it.

12:00.800 --> 12:03.007
Oh, a shammy!

12:03.240 --> 12:05.288
Come look, Daddy.

12:07.680 --> 12:10.604
<i>FTSE hits 3 year low in banks</i>
- Turn it up.

12:13.640 --> 12:15.838
Panic, confusion and chaos.

12:15.864 --> 12:18.956
They said, it couldn't
happen again,

12:19.280 --> 12:21.521
but today it just did.
Sending shockwave...

12:21.840 --> 12:24.320
What's screwed?
- Another bank collapse.

12:24.600 --> 12:26.443
Nicholas.

12:26.720 --> 12:28.324
Yeah, I'm watching now.
It's insane.

12:28.720 --> 12:32.167
A bank is put into liquidation.
It comes as a shock...

12:33.040 --> 12:35.008
I don't know,
why'd you call 'em?

12:37.000 --> 12:39.890
Allright, I'll see you
first thing tomorow.

12:40.120 --> 12:42.348
At least have repercussion
on your loan?

12:42.474 --> 12:44.187
That's a very
good word, Theo.

12:45.520 --> 12:46.681
Isn't it?

12:47.600 --> 12:48.806
Daddy?

12:50.400 --> 12:52.164
"Repercussion."

12:54.720 --> 12:56.484
It's a good word.

12:58.320 --> 13:01.563
Yes, it's a very good word.

13:08.640 --> 13:11.883
I've revalue the property
that calling in the guaranties.

13:12.080 --> 13:14.158
You need to find 30 Mill now,

13:14.184 --> 13:16.190
6 months to find the rest.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.284
And if we don't?

13:23.200 --> 13:24.531
What happens?

13:24.720 --> 13:28.042
They'll put you and everything
you own into administration.

13:29.400 --> 13:31.482
Harry you took our crazy loans.

13:32.160 --> 13:34.658
Our business is making
feta cheese, for Godsake

13:34.684 --> 13:36.713
You gambled it on a shopping....

13:36.680 --> 13:39.382
Could really do without these comments.
Right now.

13:39.408 --> 13:41.791
I'm the finance director of
this company, Harry.

13:42.160 --> 13:43.541
You never listened.

13:43.567 --> 13:46.474
It's always have to be bigger.
Better.

13:47.960 --> 13:49.564
Like these offices.

13:49.800 --> 13:51.689
We didn't need these offices.

13:52.480 --> 13:55.175
Do you know how much we paid for
that "work of art" up there?

13:55.201 --> 13:56.235
Do you?

13:56.680 --> 13:58.489
200 Grand.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.083
200 Grand for a fish.

14:02.760 --> 14:06.367
What do you want me to do Nick?
- Our business was profitable Harry.

14:07.320 --> 14:09.964
I was gonna retire in 2 years.

14:11.560 --> 14:13.961
I'd like to bring that forward.

14:18.040 --> 14:20.930
You're resigning now?
The accountants are coming in.

14:21.120 --> 14:23.248
Sorry, Harry
<i>Den boro.</i> (I can not)

14:24.640 --> 14:25.880
<i>Den boro.</i>

14:26.160 --> 14:28.003
Nicholas!
- That's enough.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.926
It's enough.
- Nicholas!

14:31.280 --> 14:35.729
Can you believe that.
- Hey, Fat Laki!

14:36.560 --> 14:38.403
You know why they call
this guy Fat Laki?

14:40.240 --> 14:42.288
Oh, wow.
Well, congratulation.

14:42.880 --> 14:45.690
I stoped eating bread.
It's sad though.

14:46.040 --> 14:48.805
I love bread.
But what can you do?

14:49.000 --> 14:51.287
This is Sophie, just relocated
form my New York office.

14:51.520 --> 14:53.098
Hallo, really pleased
to meet you.

14:53.124 --> 14:55.152
Can I just say I'm a
huge fan of Greek food.

14:55.440 --> 14:58.762
Specially the cakes.
I love the Baklava.

14:58.920 --> 15:00.445
Great.

15:00.640 --> 15:02.583
Ship's going down
and we got Baklava.

15:02.609 --> 15:04.909
So I take it the bank
supporting the work.

15:05.120 --> 15:06.622
What are the bosses proposing?

15:06.648 --> 15:09.150
They've demmanded the
300 Million we borrowed.

15:09.360 --> 15:10.645
30 by close of play.

15:10.671 --> 15:13.754
Sweet mother of God, they
are sons of bitches.

15:13.880 --> 15:16.077
They've taken a new position
on the value of the

15:16.103 --> 15:18.388
property development it's
triggered the guaranties.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.253
Can you sell it?

15:22.179 --> 15:24.693
It's not even a
building, it's not yet.

15:24.760 --> 15:26.410
So it's bankruptcy?

15:26.720 --> 15:29.929
Put something offshore I said.
- He wanted to pay his taxes.

15:30.720 --> 15:32.850
I bet I should've been
more Greek about it.

15:32.876 --> 15:34.909
Hey it's bankruptcy
baby, not a disaster.

15:35.120 --> 15:37.096
Accountants! When
it's good they get paid

15:37.122 --> 15:38.991
when it's bad
they get paid.

15:39.480 --> 15:42.609
I want my son to be a lawyer
for the same reason.

15:42.960 --> 15:44.724
He doesn't get it.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.281
So what are the options?

15:47.307 --> 15:50.666
Well, the obvious is to buy
back your own business.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.750
Took us finding
the investors to back you.

15:53.400 --> 15:56.585
And the bank will sell
back to me because..?

15:56.611 --> 15:58.591
Because no body make pinks lope
like you do Harry.

15:59.360 --> 16:01.039
The banks just want
a quick sale,

16:01.065 --> 16:02.787
they have no interest
running your business.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.241
Just jump on it.

16:08.440 --> 16:09.909
I'll talk to the
private equity firms,

16:09.935 --> 16:12.670
VCs, angels,
the ussual suspects.

16:14.080 --> 16:16.048
We'll find some one.

16:16.280 --> 16:18.052
What doesn't break
you makes you...

16:18.278 --> 16:19.515
Ah, Therapy!

16:20.680 --> 16:22.402
Don't charge me for
that will you.

16:22.428 --> 16:24.346
Rob, don't let her
charge me for that.

17:28.580 --> 17:31.460
They're going through my
things, it's disgusting!

17:31.486 --> 17:33.613
Hold it darling. rage temper,
you'll get it all back

17:34.080 --> 17:36.560
Morning.
- Oh, hi!

17:37.040 --> 17:38.565
Problem.

17:38.720 --> 17:42.202
This is the kitchen.
- Fabulous furnaces.

17:42.400 --> 17:44.038
How long is this gonna take?

17:44.064 --> 17:46.111
Most of the day
I should think.

17:46.280 --> 17:48.246
And what are we
allowed to keep?

17:48.272 --> 17:50.913
According to the
asset sheet let's see.

17:53.400 --> 17:54.534
Not very much.

17:54.560 --> 17:57.475
Little rats,
with their little claws.

17:57.640 --> 17:59.449
Quite unnecessary kid.

17:59.680 --> 18:03.605
We may as well do this now.
Ah, it's a nice computer.

18:04.960 --> 18:07.930
Oh, don't worry. We're not
gonna you know, take it

18:08.360 --> 18:09.361
Now.

18:12.440 --> 18:14.488
Anything interresting?
- Stocks!

18:15.400 --> 18:19.007
Every one's selling, I'm buying.
two, four, eight...

18:19.360 --> 18:23.604
Double your numbers quitely Theo.
And apologise.

18:23.800 --> 18:26.613
Although I'll confiscate that
wretched computer for a week.

18:26.639 --> 18:27.791
Sorry.

18:29.680 --> 18:31.523
There's no easy way of doing this.

18:31.720 --> 18:34.883
You have impeccable taste by the way
- Not mine.

18:35.240 --> 18:36.849
We operate very
strict guide lines.

18:36.975 --> 18:39.729
We have your arrange of Greek
dips at home. Don't we Ruppert?

18:41.000 --> 18:43.526
As I was saying, we operate
very strict guide lines.

18:43.880 --> 18:45.849
So, what is legally ours?

18:45.875 --> 18:48.945
Well the bank will let you keep
25,000 pounds in cash.

18:49.920 --> 18:53.003
And you're each allowed
1,000 Pounds in personal items.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.328
My Westwood Goudleyboo
cost more than that!

18:55.560 --> 18:58.431
It's such a beautiful dress.
I couldn't ressist looking.

18:58.456 --> 18:59.519
I love it too.

18:59.520 --> 19:01.329
I'll sort something out for you.
- Thank you.

19:01.960 --> 19:02.704
Nigel...

19:02.730 --> 19:05.706
You seem like such a lovely family,
We hate doing this.

19:05.920 --> 19:07.410
Nigel!

19:07.560 --> 19:12.202
Right so, 25 K cash...

19:12.800 --> 19:17.408
And 1,000 in personal...

19:18.840 --> 19:21.605
items.
What else?

19:22.680 --> 19:24.454
Ah well, one thing
that came up in

19:24.480 --> 19:26.010
the meeting with the
HQ this morning

19:26.035 --> 19:27.435
The fish & chips shop.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.771
"The Three Brothers"?
- What fish & chips shop?

19:31.200 --> 19:32.430
Well that went years ago.

19:32.456 --> 19:34.866
Well the bank unable
to seize it as an asset,

19:35.040 --> 19:37.520
because of its
co-ownership with a...

19:37.680 --> 19:40.729
Spiros Papadopoulos.
- Right.

19:41.040 --> 19:44.647
Guess that's his brother.
But they haven't spoken in years.

19:47.200 --> 19:48.842
It was so strange.

19:48.868 --> 19:51.787
Oh, James... more lemons, son.

19:56.680 --> 19:58.967
This is so good, Mrs. P.

19:59.160 --> 20:00.810
In all the year...

20:02.120 --> 20:05.966
I've never stoped thinking
about you, or your food.

20:06.160 --> 20:08.288
Ah, still so charming.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.326
Natural.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.007
So...

20:13.160 --> 20:15.845
I'm sitting there watching the tv.

20:17.160 --> 20:19.401
And suddenly I see Papadopoulos & Sons.

20:20.640 --> 20:23.120
On the TV.
- Daddy ever leverage himself.

20:27.520 --> 20:30.205
Look at this little English.

20:30.880 --> 20:33.963
Hey! I'm your uncle Spiros, right!

20:34.160 --> 20:36.527
I'm your uncle, <i>Remangga</i>!

20:36.720 --> 20:38.882
I'm gonna eat you with so beaut.

20:39.560 --> 20:41.347
Please don't eat me.

20:41.873 --> 20:44.273
He just like his mother.

20:45.200 --> 20:48.124
That litlle english man.
- That's because my mommy was english.

20:52.360 --> 20:54.681
I know that.

20:59.280 --> 21:02.011
So, I'm watching the news.

21:02.320 --> 21:05.529
And I'm thinking, what's
my baby brother gonna undone now?

21:06.040 --> 21:07.963
And just at that moment...

21:08.880 --> 21:10.803
as I'm thinking that thought,

21:11.080 --> 21:14.402
in the same split second,

21:15.120 --> 21:17.487
the phone rings, and it's you.

21:18.280 --> 21:20.418
I mean, it's gotta be some.

21:20.444 --> 21:22.993
kind of quantum physics there.
No?

21:23.680 --> 21:24.987
No?

21:26.960 --> 21:29.440
It's sane. Insane.

21:33.200 --> 21:34.201
Katie?

21:35.640 --> 21:38.564
You're so grown up.
I can't believe this.

21:39.080 --> 21:41.751
You were like...
just a girl.

21:41.777 --> 21:43.986
Dumpy and spoilled.

21:45.480 --> 21:48.563
Look at you now.
- She's still a little spoilled.

21:49.160 --> 21:51.731
Nanny P!
- And dumpy.

21:52.680 --> 21:54.205
Not so dumpy.

21:56.080 --> 21:57.411
Ah, James!

21:59.200 --> 22:02.602
Sweet baby James.
When you were three...

22:02.760 --> 22:05.401
How old was he?
Three or four?

22:06.327 --> 22:08.808
We used to play fight.
Remember?

22:09.960 --> 22:11.417
You love to fight.

22:11.543 --> 22:14.374
While you blow up my nose!

22:14.960 --> 22:18.442
Yeah! Fuck, that hurts.
- Spiros!

22:20.040 --> 22:21.485
Sorry.

22:21.640 --> 22:24.723
Duck, I said duck.
Quak, quak.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.552
I know what you said.

22:26.878 --> 22:29.708
Alright, don't tell your father.

22:38.280 --> 22:40.965
Harry, thank you for
phone-ning me.

22:41.280 --> 22:44.329
Now, seriously.
I'm so greatful.

22:45.120 --> 22:46.360
There's...

22:48.920 --> 22:50.874
I know there's so much for you,

22:50.900 --> 22:52.916
we need to sort out you and I.

22:56.240 --> 22:58.322
But we should be celebrating.

22:59.400 --> 23:00.447
Yeah.

23:01.040 --> 23:03.008
I don't drink anymore.
Just so you know.

23:03.520 --> 23:06.842
But you don't have to be
drunk to dance. That's what I say now!

23:07.040 --> 23:08.610
You don't have to be drunk to dance!

23:09.000 --> 23:12.243
Fantastic. So, look..
we're losing the house.

23:12.760 --> 23:15.331
And everything.
- What?

23:15.920 --> 23:19.385
It's only temporary. I'm in
negotiation with top corp.

23:19.411 --> 23:20.985
finance team to buy back.

23:21.060 --> 23:23.241
But in the mean time I need
to free up some capital.

23:23.267 --> 23:25.886
I'll give you what ever I got.
But you know I don't have much money.

23:26.280 --> 23:29.284
I don't want you money Spiro.
I wanna sell "Three brothers".

23:30.640 --> 23:31.597
We split 50/50.

23:31.623 --> 23:34.875
I get enough money to pay
the rent, pay few bills off

23:35.160 --> 23:37.811
And it's great for you,
'cause you got some cash to do..

23:38.000 --> 23:40.571
what ever it is you wanna.. do.

23:48.360 --> 23:50.886
We can't sell the "Three Brothers".
- I knew it.

23:51.240 --> 23:54.323
I knew it'd be difficult,
I knew it, I knew it. I knew it.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.966
You haven't changed.
- It doesn't feel right.

23:57.200 --> 23:59.851
You're loving this.
- Oh Harry! I want to help.

24:00.240 --> 24:02.908
Can't you see we're in the shit!
- Gentlemen, please!

24:03.760 --> 24:06.241
May I suggest we sleep on this?

24:06.267 --> 24:08.746
Before it gets out of hand.

24:11.280 --> 24:15.171
Yeah, this is good advice, Mrs. P.

24:16.520 --> 24:18.568
Harry.

24:19.880 --> 24:22.247
Harry!
- Ok, what ever.

24:39.600 --> 24:42.729
I couldn't sleep last night
not awake.

24:43.800 --> 24:45.801
Over and over in my mind,

24:45.827 --> 24:48.149
I was trying to imagine
selling the shop.

24:49.480 --> 24:52.131
Something here was saying: No.

24:52.320 --> 24:53.560
No!

24:53.800 --> 24:56.280
I want to help you.

24:56.440 --> 24:57.885
All of you.

24:59.840 --> 25:01.665
So I pray for guidance.

25:01.591 --> 25:03.789
I ask the universe:
Please help me.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.731
Please help me
help these people.

25:08.600 --> 25:11.680
And I must've fallen
asleep not long after.

25:11.706 --> 25:12.755
A crazy sleep.

25:13.120 --> 25:15.690
And then this dream.

25:16.880 --> 25:18.962
There was this...

25:19.240 --> 25:20.651
This music.

25:21.360 --> 25:25.081
The most incredible music.
And you and me Harry.

25:25.840 --> 25:27.808
Running the shop.

25:29.440 --> 25:33.047
I woke up with tears in my eyes.
And I knew.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.968
So, what are we
going on about?

25:38.440 --> 25:40.841
We're going to
re-open the "Three Brothers".

25:42.920 --> 25:44.843
Briliant!

25:47.200 --> 25:49.248
Is he talking about us?

25:49.880 --> 25:53.327
I think he is.
- There's nothing there.

25:53.480 --> 25:55.715
Exactly! It's empty, useless.

25:55.741 --> 25:57.590
We get nothing for it.

25:58.240 --> 26:00.686
But if we made the "Three Brothers"
great again...

26:01.000 --> 26:04.527
Hey! That is our destiny!

26:06.520 --> 26:08.458
Ok, it needs work, sure.

26:08.484 --> 26:11.631
But Destiny needs work.

26:12.120 --> 26:14.282
You're still crazy.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.046
We have....

26:16.240 --> 26:18.437
You have a better chance

26:18.763 --> 26:21.756
of getting through this if we
increase the value of the shop.

26:22.440 --> 26:24.647
I'm not opening
a fish & chips shop.

26:24.840 --> 26:28.128
I'm Papadopoulos & Sons,
I'm on supermarket sales.

26:28.180 --> 26:31.229
Oh, God. What I would tell my friends?
- I don't know, maybe the truth?

26:31.880 --> 26:35.601
"I don't know, maybe the truth?"
- God, fuck off.

26:35.800 --> 26:38.041
F-F-F-fuck you.
- Enough!

26:38.240 --> 26:39.765
People, hear me out.

26:40.360 --> 26:42.460
If we get it up and running
again, we can sell it

26:42.486 --> 26:44.629
as a going concern.
Instead of an empty shop.

26:46.120 --> 26:48.646
This deal that you working on,
could take ages.

26:48.880 --> 26:52.726
In the mean time, you're getting cash in.
And you're saving money.

26:52.960 --> 26:54.450
Because it's got 2 bed rooms.

27:00.520 --> 27:04.081
The "Three Brothers" is a gold mine.
Used to be.

27:05.720 --> 27:08.200
Can be again.
- When did you become so practical?

27:08.480 --> 27:10.736
I'll get it fixed.
I'm handy man now.

27:11.262 --> 27:13.147
Oh, I thought you
were a waiter Spiro?

27:13.360 --> 27:15.066
Around too much booze, Mrs. P.

27:15.092 --> 27:17.185
 I went travelling.

27:17.600 --> 27:19.451
Belgium, America, Brooklyn.

27:19.477 --> 27:22.836
I ended up managing a
block of apartments in LA.

27:23.160 --> 27:26.687
I do painting, decorating,
plumbing, electrics, everything.

27:27.040 --> 27:30.010
A man who can fix things.
- I've got a van.

27:30.280 --> 27:32.521
Oh, it's alright everyone.
Don't panic, he's got a van.

27:34.080 --> 27:37.562
Lets go look at the shop.
Let me go and sub working on it now.

27:37.800 --> 27:40.460
You're out of your mind.
I know what you're up to.

27:40.486 --> 27:42.467
You wanna make some
money for yourself.

27:43.520 --> 27:45.602
That's fine, it's OK.

27:45.920 --> 27:48.127
Atleast you thinking
smart these days.

27:48.360 --> 27:51.091
But don't involve us in all this.

27:52.520 --> 27:56.002
I want to help.
- Given the current situation...

27:57.440 --> 27:59.966
I think it's worth consideration.

28:00.120 --> 28:01.565
What?!

28:01.720 --> 28:04.724
I'm not opening a Fish & Chips shop!

28:05.400 --> 28:06.765
I'm not!

28:07.440 --> 28:09.602
I'm not! I'm not! I'm not!

28:09.800 --> 28:11.768
Not! Not!

28:15.360 --> 28:16.885
What?

28:18.200 --> 28:20.646
May I have a private word??

28:24.160 --> 28:25.525
Now?

28:30.640 --> 28:34.042
You're behaving like a child.
- Mrs. Parrington, with all due respect..

28:34.280 --> 28:38.046
Your're the father of this family.
- I'd rather boy of my own, he can back to chip shop.

28:38.640 --> 28:41.769
What a terrible thing to say.
Really?

28:41.960 --> 28:45.282
He's unreliable Mrs.P, he's iresponsible,
he's a talker.

28:45.440 --> 28:48.887
He sings, he dance, he plays
the bongo drums. He's a waiter.

28:49.120 --> 28:51.600
He'll drive us all mad
and leave us broke.

28:51.800 --> 28:54.784
He seems a fond to me.
He doesn't drink anymore.

28:54.810 --> 28:56.149
And he wants to help.

28:57.520 --> 29:01.047
Moving back to a chip shop will
destroy my children's confidence.

29:01.200 --> 29:04.761
Seeing you behave like a spoiled
little brat will do that perfect.

29:06.600 --> 29:09.729
We're gonna smell like Fish & Chips!

29:09.880 --> 29:13.168
The children need a home.

29:13.360 --> 29:17.331
I dont' give a fink with your snot.

29:17.880 --> 29:21.566
Look at you. Everything has
to be a drama with you Greeks.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.842
Show some guts, young man!

30:28.760 --> 30:31.161
So many memories!

30:31.800 --> 30:35.168
Are we really going
to live in that?

30:36.520 --> 30:39.205
I'm trying to find something good.

30:40.760 --> 30:42.285
And?

30:43.120 --> 30:44.406
No, nothing.

30:45.160 --> 30:48.050
Nonsense. You'll love it!

30:48.560 --> 30:50.961
We're gonna have a crazy time.

30:51.640 --> 30:54.239
We gonna fix this place up.
I'm gonna teach you

30:54.265 --> 30:56.592
how to do some greek
dancing, some singing.

30:56.760 --> 30:59.889
We'll fry some good fish,
we'll laugh.

31:00.640 --> 31:03.610
Good times!
Good times!

31:22.440 --> 31:26.047
I don't believe it! - What?
- The Greeks are back.

31:27.160 --> 31:29.561
What Greeks?
- Those Greeks.

31:30.080 --> 31:32.481
Hallo, my old friends.

31:33.280 --> 31:36.329

32:04.320 --> 32:08.325

32:18.200 --> 32:19.770

32:50.160 --> 32:51.889
Wasting it.

32:52.080 --> 32:54.447
Gambling it, losing it.

32:56.040 --> 32:57.724
Happy days!

36:19.120 --> 36:22.408
We used to bring out the tables
and the chairs with the other Greeks.

36:23.200 --> 36:26.886
What ever happen to
Soula, Pani and Stavros.

36:27.120 --> 36:29.168
Love that crowd.

36:29.560 --> 36:33.645
Sometime it'd be poker games,
sometimes dancing, we had fun.

36:34.800 --> 36:37.371
Did my Daddy dance?
- Yeah, I thaught him.

36:38.160 --> 36:40.811
And your mother.
- My Mummy?

36:41.520 --> 36:43.010
Hey, <i>Mangga</i>!

36:43.600 --> 36:47.207
This is the place where
your mommy and your daddy met.

36:48.520 --> 36:51.285
What, up here?
- Yeah.

36:51.520 --> 36:54.251
They talked all night,

36:55.200 --> 36:57.885
Yeah, there was
a lot of dancing here.

36:58.400 --> 36:59.401
Hey!

37:00.440 --> 37:02.329
You want me to show you?
How 'bout it?

37:06.000 --> 37:08.670
Spiros, please. We're
not on holidays.

37:08.696 --> 37:10.269
Just shoveling around.

37:10.480 --> 37:11.891
What?

37:14.560 --> 37:16.483
I'll show you later.

37:19.360 --> 37:21.647
You alright?

37:22.480 --> 37:24.005
Yeah.

37:24.160 --> 37:26.162
I like the view.

37:27.920 --> 37:30.321
I might put up
some plants up here.

37:39.360 --> 37:41.591
Hello.
- Hi

37:42.560 --> 37:46.645
Do you have a light?
- You came all this way for a light?

37:59.400 --> 38:02.006
I'm from Kebab shop
across the road.

38:03.240 --> 38:04.571
Nice.

38:13.400 --> 38:15.801
My dad, wants me
to spy on you.

38:16.360 --> 38:18.601
I don't think he likes greeks.

38:22.160 --> 38:24.447
You wanna go out sometime?

38:26.480 --> 38:28.050
Yeah, alright.

38:28.920 --> 38:31.844
I'm Mehmet

38:35.640 --> 38:38.211
Shit around here ain't it?

38:38.400 --> 38:39.925
Yeah.

38:41.440 --> 38:43.124
Pretty much.

38:53.880 --> 38:56.167
Catch you later.
- Yeah.

38:57.080 --> 38:58.366
Bye.

40:26.720 --> 40:28.768
Mortimer, Rolf and Jones.

40:29.520 --> 40:31.488
Oh, hi Dad!

40:31.720 --> 40:34.929
Yeah, I got them.
They're beautiful. Thank you.

40:36.240 --> 40:38.686
Alright, put her on.

40:39.800 --> 40:41.484
He's here.
- Right, just a second.

40:42.360 --> 40:43.771
Hi mom.

40:44.320 --> 40:46.209
Thanks for the flower,
they're lovely.

40:48.400 --> 40:51.688
There was nothing
wrong with New York.

40:52.880 --> 40:55.201
Yes, you can stay
friends with Matt,

40:57.080 --> 40:58.525
and Bill and Susan.

41:01.000 --> 41:05.324
Mom, I've got a meeting.
I don't know just some meeting.

41:06.560 --> 41:09.006
Yeah, I promise.
I will.

41:09.560 --> 41:12.325
I love you.
Okay, bye.

41:13.840 --> 41:15.524
Parents.

41:15.720 --> 41:18.246
Is Matt your...
- Ex.

41:20.320 --> 41:22.721
A bit of a tosser, yeah?

41:25.160 --> 41:28.289
I wouldn't say tosser exactly.

41:29.600 --> 41:33.924
We just want a different things.
- Yada, yada, yada.

41:34.720 --> 41:38.202
Just like me and my ex.
She was keen and everything, but...

41:38.440 --> 41:42.161
I don't know, her forward thinking.
So I killed the romance.

41:44.920 --> 41:47.366
It's good to have this
little chat, you know?

41:47.560 --> 41:48.803
Shouldn't always be
about work.

41:48.829 --> 41:51.847
Society so work obssesed.
Tragic.

41:54.680 --> 41:56.409
Right, back to work.

42:11.480 --> 42:14.370
Some big names.
- Pop & Sons is still in the cash count.

42:14.560 --> 42:18.007
What's the detential deal structure?
- That's the pitcher.

42:18.160 --> 42:21.607
You still be key running
the business, but...

42:22.320 --> 42:25.403
But?
- Money isn't cheap Harry.

42:25.640 --> 42:28.041
These guys would want
the 95% of the company.

42:29.680 --> 42:33.162
Leaving me with nothing.
I'll do the same thing.

42:35.560 --> 42:40.282
I'd be CEO of Papadopoulos & Sons,
get a salary, get the house back.

42:40.760 --> 42:43.889
My children's future.
- Beats Fish & Chips.

42:44.280 --> 42:47.841
You'd be working for some one else.
- I'd be working for some one else.

42:48.440 --> 42:51.284
By the way, I'm not actualy
running the Fish & Chips shop.

42:51.880 --> 42:54.406
Just helping my brother relaunch.
- Sure.

42:54.600 --> 42:56.015
Listen, there maybe another way.

42:56.041 --> 42:58.516
Came up in conversation with
the Norske Velconan Bank.

42:59.040 --> 43:01.762
It'll be a long line of a straight
loan to buy back the business.

43:01.788 --> 43:02.467
Why would they loan to me?

43:02.840 --> 43:04.683
Well, it's awesome.
Want me to look into it?

43:04.920 --> 43:07.651
Sure, no choice.
- Okay, cool.

43:07.840 --> 43:11.128
Gotta go, got an emergency.
Well, get this:

43:11.560 --> 43:16.009
A high tech portable toilet company
that is litteraly gone down the tubes.

43:17.080 --> 43:20.202
An internet ready, wireless
crapper, with waterproof

43:20.228 --> 43:22.748
keyboards and screen.
For the love of God.

43:22.960 --> 43:24.450
Because taking a dump
needed an overhaul.

43:25.200 --> 43:26.816
So, some body's
gonna bury 'em.

43:27.542 --> 43:30.231
<i>In padre spiritus sanctus</i> ect, ect.

43:30.440 --> 43:32.647
Gotta love a down turn.

43:34.200 --> 43:35.440
Laters!

43:43.560 --> 43:47.042
I think we ecurrently doing
with your brother, sounds liberating.

43:49.080 --> 43:52.482
I'm liberating myself from my
last 25,000 in dissused chip shop.

43:53.440 --> 43:55.602
But it's llike a start up.

43:55.760 --> 43:58.366
Isn't that the most
exciting phase of any venture?

43:58.720 --> 44:03.601
Taking a bit of risk, developing
your product, and your services.

44:04.040 --> 44:06.486
Learning about your market.

44:06.840 --> 44:10.686
Look, some of the largest companies
on the planet never make a profit.

44:10.880 --> 44:12.309
Like a real profit, it's all

44:12.335 --> 44:14.273
accounting tricks,
and leverage debt.

44:14.960 --> 44:17.122
What I'm trying to say is..

44:17.440 --> 44:20.444
Does it matter if
the business is a small one,

44:20.640 --> 44:24.440
as long as it makes a profit,
and the people who work there happy?

44:27.160 --> 44:29.547
What are you doing working
in a place like this?

44:29.973 --> 44:31.851
This is only temporary.

44:32.460 --> 44:35.923
I got divorce recently,
came to london for a fresh start.

44:36.480 --> 44:39.086
I'm actualy looking into
setting up my own business.

44:41.680 --> 44:44.081
Well, I'm sorry about that.

44:44.960 --> 44:46.610
About the divorce I mean.

44:48.840 --> 44:50.775
I've been meaning to ask,

44:50.801 --> 44:53.109
can I come and visit your
shop sometime?

44:55.080 --> 44:57.481
There isn't one.
- When it's up and running.

44:58.920 --> 45:00.471
It's a chip shop.

45:00.497 --> 45:03.507
It's hot, on your feet all hours,

45:03.740 --> 45:06.302
verbal abuse from
costumers on a friday night,

45:07.520 --> 45:10.251
I wasn't applying
for a job Harry,

45:10.920 --> 45:12.843
I just want to stop by.

45:26.400 --> 45:28.368
It's late.

45:29.440 --> 45:31.681
What are you doing, little man?

45:31.880 --> 45:33.211
Trading.

45:34.240 --> 45:37.483
I watch trends,
making trades based on patterns.

45:38.480 --> 45:42.769
I dont' even look at the fundamentals.
- Fundamentals?

45:43.080 --> 45:47.404
You know, capital employed,
gaining ratio, etc.

45:47.680 --> 45:52.083
Not even profit or turn over.
Short term, but I can spot a trend.

45:52.960 --> 45:56.681
I know what's gonna happen.
- So you can see the future?

45:59.440 --> 46:01.920
And?
- Same as the past.

46:02.160 --> 46:05.960
But to shot order from chaos.
I'm done for today.

46:09.640 --> 46:12.450
Ah, Theo, Theo, Theo.

46:17.040 --> 46:21.204
Sweet dreams.
- Uncle Spiros?

46:22.880 --> 46:25.167
You knew my mummy?

46:26.880 --> 46:28.211
Yes.

46:29.040 --> 46:32.249
She was... beautiful.

46:33.880 --> 46:36.406
And she was very kind to me.

46:38.720 --> 46:41.200
I wish I had
my mummy sometimes.

46:42.440 --> 46:43.932
It's very hard for you.

46:43.958 --> 46:46.356
I'd make her laugh uncle Spiros.

46:48.880 --> 46:50.689
You make me laugh.

46:53.760 --> 46:56.240
I'll come out with some classics.

46:57.160 --> 46:59.049
Real gems.

47:00.840 --> 47:02.649
Wasted on this family.

47:07.840 --> 47:10.320
You are something else.

47:11.880 --> 47:14.087
We can hear everything.

47:14.280 --> 47:17.363
Don't fall for him Spiros,
he's a little thinker.

47:18.320 --> 47:21.449
Say the magic release poem.
- No.

47:21.720 --> 47:24.610
Yeah, actualy say
the magic release poem.

47:24.800 --> 47:26.290
No.

47:27.800 --> 47:32.408
Theo Papadopoulos
is Hippopotamus

47:32.720 --> 47:36.850
He's always making such a fuzz
from his toe to lots of us.

47:45.960 --> 47:47.928
Ah, your kids.

47:48.120 --> 47:49.929
They're something.

48:00.640 --> 48:02.483
Don't worry.

48:03.200 --> 48:05.362
I'm not to religious.

48:10.640 --> 48:14.167
I'm a lapsed budhist. I do
everything a good budhist does.

48:14.400 --> 48:16.243
Except abstinence.

48:23.840 --> 48:25.888
Ear plugs?

48:28.680 --> 48:31.889
This is a fantastic things.

48:33.240 --> 48:34.868
Did you ever imagine..

48:34.994 --> 48:37.526
30 years to go back here?

48:41.360 --> 48:42.566
No.

48:42.800 --> 48:46.009
Remember, how excited we felt
when we first got his place?

48:46.480 --> 48:48.767
It feels like that again!

48:51.120 --> 48:54.681
My gut says:
<i>Poshalaskan polo covecod</i>

48:54.920 --> 48:58.367
What do you think?
- Should never taken out that line.

49:00.880 --> 49:04.202
We'll talk fish
after we fix this place.

49:05.120 --> 49:07.600
We'll talk fish
after we fix this place.

49:08.680 --> 49:10.728
Katie's got some good thoughts.

49:11.760 --> 49:14.411
Says we should keep the old look.

49:16.360 --> 49:20.570
And she had some beautiful
idea about the uniforms.

49:20.720 --> 49:24.566
Then you know the potential
yield at the plaza, Papadopoulos Plaza.

49:25.840 --> 49:28.179
Fully developed
with 1,000 year lease

49:28.205 --> 49:30.996
I'd have kept the free home.

49:31.200 --> 49:33.680
I'm telling you Spiro...

49:34.240 --> 49:35.969
It was good.

49:36.680 --> 49:40.571
Not have been worth a fortune.
Worth, I don't know...

49:41.520 --> 49:44.444
1,5 billion, 1,6 billion?

49:45.760 --> 49:47.808
1,6 billion.

49:48.760 --> 49:52.810
Big numbers, Spiro.
Big, big numbers.

50:18.680 --> 50:22.605
Poor children when we came to the UK.
With nothing.

50:23.400 --> 50:25.129
We start again.

50:25.720 --> 50:29.566
Fat Laki, the weight
you lost is an inspiration.

50:29.760 --> 50:32.369
Phil the Till, you
have many Greeks

50:32.395 --> 50:35.076
with your tax friendly
till machines.

50:35.240 --> 50:38.289
Ey, only two things are certain in life.

50:38.520 --> 50:40.363
Death and taxes.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.401
Unless you're Greek!
Then it's only death!

50:45.760 --> 50:48.923
Nikos, Kyriaco, Androniki, Loula,

50:49.640 --> 50:52.371
Uncle Panikos, Aphrodite, Maria

50:52.560 --> 50:55.131
And of course fater Jimmy.
Thank you.

50:55.960 --> 50:58.804
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

50:59.400 --> 51:02.404
Father Jimmy get done just
selling ilegal kabooze "Rambo"?

51:02.560 --> 51:04.847
He owns 3 liquor
stores in Palmers Green.

51:05.080 --> 51:07.208
He must hated me.

51:07.400 --> 51:09.846
People, hallo!
Sorry, hi.

51:10.040 --> 51:13.567
Ah, just wanted you know this is
temporary situation for the family.

51:13.760 --> 51:16.047
I'm curently negotiation with the
top corporate finance team

51:16.240 --> 51:20.006
about requiring the assets
of Papadopoulos & Sons. That's it.

51:20.800 --> 51:24.361
What did he say?
- He's had some sort of breakdown.

51:25.240 --> 51:27.846
Tragic.
- James! Musik!

51:30.240 --> 51:31.685
Thank you.

51:33.560 --> 51:37.281
I officially anounce
the renovation

51:37.480 --> 51:39.528
of the "Three Brothers".

51:39.840 --> 51:44.607
That's for when we launch sometihng.
- To hell with convention.

54:05.020 --> 54:08.284
Don't rush me. It's been a long time
since I had meat like this.

54:10.520 --> 54:12.170
What's he doing?

54:12.480 --> 54:15.006
He's assessing the competion.

54:19.120 --> 54:21.851
There's a reason why
Hassan is still in business.

54:22.520 --> 54:24.921
Texture: very good.
Way above average.

54:25.080 --> 54:27.128
Meat content: hive.

54:27.360 --> 54:30.569
Mechanically recovered
cheap rubish, you wish.

54:30.760 --> 54:34.287
This is a quality donut.
Nicely cooked.

54:34.440 --> 54:37.364
With all the right
combination of herbs.

54:38.320 --> 54:39.685
It's beautiful.

54:40.360 --> 54:42.458
It doesn't mean we
can't take them on.

54:42.484 --> 54:44.151
No. I'm not saying we can't.

54:53.840 --> 54:55.285
Yes?

54:56.040 --> 54:57.849
Sorry I...

55:02.160 --> 55:04.128
What do you want?

55:04.800 --> 55:06.928
That's a lot of Greeks.

55:11.560 --> 55:14.882
What? We're going out.
- Not too late.

55:20.160 --> 55:22.288
Well, she is eighteen.

55:36.320 --> 55:39.881
We'll make a better product to
the cheaper price with larger protion.

55:40.440 --> 55:41.927
We'll lose money on the
kebabs on the sort terms,

55:41.953 --> 55:43.469
put the Turks out of the
business within the year,

55:43.640 --> 55:45.769
make a margin on the
first and where the

55:45.795 --> 55:47.715
rest of this crummy
street packed up.

55:48.360 --> 55:50.567
We'll rise our prices
and cut our portion size.

55:50.720 --> 55:53.087
The entrepeneur has spoken.
- Hey!

55:53.440 --> 55:56.489
It's temporary, but as long as
we're here we do business.

56:06.360 --> 56:09.011
You know, when he was a little boy

56:09.480 --> 56:12.802
come home from school
and sit there, just like that.

56:15.760 --> 56:17.888
Who was the third?

56:19.240 --> 56:21.368
Brother?
- Michael.

56:23.200 --> 56:26.443
He died in the fire without parents,
your grand parents in Cyprus.

56:26.640 --> 56:29.291
In a war between the Greeks and the Turks.

56:29.920 --> 56:32.321
But you both escaped?

56:33.000 --> 56:35.162
Spiros climb down

56:35.360 --> 56:38.762
and Michael who was... six

56:38.920 --> 56:40.251
Yeah.

56:40.440 --> 56:43.603
Drop me down.
I was just a baby.

56:43.760 --> 56:46.730
I caught him.
But Michael, he...

56:48.480 --> 56:51.563
Told me highly to jump, but he...

56:52.960 --> 56:55.247
He ran right back in to the house.

56:56.560 --> 56:58.244
I never know why.

56:59.240 --> 57:01.925
One night everything changes.

57:02.160 --> 57:05.050
I thought probably wanted
to save his mom and dad.

57:06.120 --> 57:08.885
You know what?
I never thought about that.

57:10.720 --> 57:13.246
You could be right. yeah.

57:13.960 --> 57:17.442
You're wise boy, James.
Your soul is old.

57:19.600 --> 57:22.213
Tell me, this is always been

57:22.239 --> 57:24.552
a big question for me
for many years.

57:24.840 --> 57:27.684
Do you think I could've
done something else?

57:28.600 --> 57:31.888
For Michael?
- No, you were holding a baby.

57:32.520 --> 57:35.683
Yeah. - When how old were you?
- I was nine.

57:36.960 --> 57:40.362
You're only a boy.
Like Theo.

57:45.240 --> 57:46.810
H?

57:48.720 --> 57:50.802
Hallo?
What's wrong with him?

57:52.320 --> 57:53.367
He!

57:53.600 --> 57:56.843
Don't worry, it's temporary.

58:04.360 --> 58:05.964
Excuse me.

58:14.160 --> 58:15.844
Did I said something wrong?

58:29.840 --> 58:31.649
He was only nine.

58:35.360 --> 58:37.681
I never thought about
how young he was.

58:42.560 --> 58:44.403
I bet he has.

58:48.280 --> 58:49.691
Tee.

58:54.000 --> 58:55.331
James?

58:59.200 --> 59:00.690
Come here.

59:03.880 --> 59:05.370
Sit down.

59:11.200 --> 59:13.539
I've let you and your brother
and your sister down.

59:13.565 --> 59:14.349
Dad.

59:14.360 --> 59:17.502
I've made a promise to your mother,
that I'd take care of you.

59:17.528 --> 59:18.674
And you're doing that.

59:18.880 --> 59:21.770
This is humiliating for you.
- Dad, we'll get through this.

59:23.720 --> 59:25.484
I...

59:26.200 --> 59:29.170
I don't know... King Lear.

59:32.880 --> 59:35.451
I don't know the story.
- Well then...

59:36.120 --> 59:38.646
King Lear loses everything.

59:38.840 --> 59:40.618
Absolutely everything.
And he find himself

59:40.644 --> 59:42.472
in the middle of his store room.

59:43.280 --> 59:44.850
With nothing.

59:45.440 --> 59:46.930
And...

59:47.840 --> 59:51.367
His kids, they... hate him.

59:51.920 --> 59:54.166
They even think of him a prick.

59:54.692 --> 59:56.575
What happens to him?

59:58.920 --> 01:00:01.400
Well then he dies.

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:07.124
But it has to end like that.
Because it's a tragedy.

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:14.336
I'm sorry about your plants.

01:00:14.362 --> 01:00:16.196
I can get a new ones.

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:19.128
Why you didn't bring more with you?

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:22.848
I don't wanna get in the way.

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:25.609
You such a sweet boy.

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:31.643
Get that from your mother.
Your stutter's getting better.

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:36.204
You know what?

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:39.201
I'm gonna go
and get you a plant.

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:42.284
Now.
From the house.

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:44.924
What, right now?
- Yeah.

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:47.807
I'm gonna go and get you a plant.

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:52.486
Like King Lear, yeah?

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:54.449
Ah.. yeah.

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:56.804
Sort of.

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:37.567
There you go.

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:42.247
Oh, no!
No, no.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.604
That's perfect.

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:56.686
Daddy!
- Hallo.

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:01.483
What's going on?
- We're making...

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:06.247
Batter.
- Uncle Spiros's special mix.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.241
That's all I could find.
- Thank you.

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.249
It's prety late.

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:18.010
I said they could help.
- This is a holiday.

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:21.966
Uncle Spiros said I can make
beer and vodka batter.

01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:25.408
It doesn't sound very good.

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:30.403
Hey, you need to stay up,
it's the holidays.

01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:34.526
Tomorrow we'll look through
news paper and pick up some stocks.

01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:38.288
How's that grab you?
- Natural resources is a good buy.

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:43.003
Hey, wait. 
Show us your fine skills.

01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:47.526
Yeah, I was telling them how you
were born with timer in your head.

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:50.530
How you fried to perfection.
Everytime.

01:03:50.556 --> 01:03:51.989
Not tonight.

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:55.244
Come on, Dad.

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:58.091
Show us how to fillet a fish.
- Go on daddy.

01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:00.648
Yeah, H. Come on.
Show us.

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:02.967
Show us.

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.041
Show us.

01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:08.763
Show us, show us, show us...

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:13.523
You should really be
thinking about bed all of you.

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:15.691
Good night.

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:18.686
Bed?

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:01.247
Alright, so where we going?

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:04.930
City. Get a loan,

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:07.885
get the business back, get
the house back. This suit alright?

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:11.322
Yeah. It's a suit.

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:15.491
Oh! Doesn't I don't know... fit.

01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:23.360
I don't believe it, They're kissing.

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:30.240
Ah, kids. Come on.
- In the street?

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:33.722
They're smoking, 
they're hanging out.

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:36.404
Did they...

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:37.806
What?
- They're screwing?

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:43.481
No. They just kissing.

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:47.282
We gotta get out of this place.

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:49.525
Come on, he's a sweet guy.

01:05:49.551 --> 01:05:52.067
Out! Family's in the gutter.

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:56.366
You're over reacting Harry.
- The thought of her pregnant.

01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:57.971
In a kebab shop.

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:03.126
Harry, don't worry about Katie.

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:06.048
She can look after herself.

01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:48.610
What are you doing?

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:51.364
I got something to say.

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:55.687
About Katie? Is she pregnant?
- No.

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:00.570
Oh God. Are you...
Have you got cancer?

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:02.966
No.

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:05.204
No, just...

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:08.323
Just bear with me.

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:23.961
So...
Here it goes.

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:28.483
"After years of abuse, on my behalf

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:32.965
and unexceptable behaviour.
I reached the moment of clarity".

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:36.607
Actualy this was two years ago.

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:40.539
"I'd like to apologise
for the hurt I've caused"

01:07:40.565 --> 01:07:41.835
What now?

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:46.731
"There were aspects of my 
behaviour which was unexceptable.

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:51.927
This includes and is not limited to... "
- Why now?

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:55.168
I've been carying this...

01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:58.290
If you don't wanna hear
we can do it later.

01:07:58.316 --> 01:08:00.312
No, now is fine.
Now is good.

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:02.923
I've just...

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:13.689
Skip that.

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:22.450
"I have abused your generousity."

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:24.721
I agree with that statement.

01:08:26.319 --> 01:08:29.721
"When we were children
and got to London,

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:33.649
I look after you. Got you ready for school,

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:36.046
made you do your home work.

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:40.042
I taught you to cook, 
ride a bike,

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:42.402
speak Greek, dance,

01:08:44.319 --> 01:08:46.720
Why don't you speak Greek?

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:52.648
You were reading a list.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.308
"I've fought with Steven Klein,

01:08:59.334 --> 01:09:02.772
when he accused you of stealing
his ortopedic shoe."

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:05.046
Remember that?
- Yeah.

01:09:06.479 --> 01:09:09.086
Did you take it?
- No.

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:13.843
You can tell me now.
- I didn't steal the shoe.

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:16.801
Are you gonna 
read all of that?

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:19.689
I don't have to.

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:22.321
Why did it go wrong with us, Spiro?
We might as well get to it.

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:25.444
Why did you turn againts
me after I left the shop?

01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:29.327
I never turn againts you.
- That's what it felt like.

01:09:38.439 --> 01:09:40.841
I was jealous of you.

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:43.770
You were my brother.

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:47.881
Brothers get jealous.

01:09:48.279 --> 01:09:50.600
You were more than a brother.

01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:52.888
You were my life.

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:57.324
And then you left.
Gone.

01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:01.366
I set up the business.
I wasn't gonna stay in the shop.

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:05.882
You could've come with me.

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:08.930
Harry, you were so fast.

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:12.727
You were like a plane,
like a super sonic jet.

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:15.916
But I gave you
everything you wanted,

01:10:15.942 --> 01:10:17.095
did I ever once turn you down

01:10:17.121 --> 01:10:19.117
in all the years after
I left the business. Did I?

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:23.521
And after it went past.
But it was never enough.

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.404
Every week something new.

01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:28.046
Writing cheque to...

01:10:27.872 --> 01:10:30.675
I don't know you've got
some wierd friends.

01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:34.384
Who was that bloke with a pin head
keep turning up at the house?

01:10:34.410 --> 01:10:35.871
Not of my friend anymore.

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:44.847
And than drunk at Elisabeths funural?

01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:51.651
And you big teared at his speach.

01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:56.045
I heard about it.

01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:00.401
Well that was it.
For me, for us.

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:08.148
You were right to cut me off.

01:11:08.174 --> 01:11:10.471
She never had a bad
word for you, Elisabeth.

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:14.442
She always forgive you,
and she make me forgive you.

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:17.209
Everytime.

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:21.008
Yeah, she did.

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:28.209
I always have a way back,
when she was with us.

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:34.408
Elisabeth was so good to me.

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:47.042
She was our world.

01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:50.522
She was our world.

01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:02.361
I'm sorry, I can't...

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:08.087
It's okay, H.
- I gotta get to this meeting.

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:11.251
It's an important meeting.

01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:16.366
It's okay to miss her.

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:21.044
Oh Man.

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:31.004
Just give me a minute.

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:53.605
With the help of Lars
and the Norske Velconan Bank

01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:56.611
we aim to buy Pap & Sons
back from the recievent.

01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:58.248
Also, Harry I have to say

01:12:58.274 --> 01:13:01.214
that I believe there's an
intuitive bonds

01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:04.164
between the Greek and the Nordic people.

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:06.787
As well maybe the
first Vikings were

01:13:06.813 --> 01:13:09.716
decendants from the
ancient Greek, some where

01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:11.555
in the deepest of time.

01:13:11.581 --> 01:13:13.350
Until it's so...

01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:15.565
...so vagnerian.

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:17.605
Yeah?

01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:20.782
We should point out the new approach.

01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:25.840
To buy Papadopoulos & Sons,

01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:28.645
but divest the food
manufacturing side of the business.

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:31.407
Divest the food manufacturing?
What else is there?

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:34.600
Set off the food, but keep the property.

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:36.804
Papadopoulos Plaza.

01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:39.726
It's gonna be worth a fortune!

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:43.481
That's not what I had in mind.
- It's an asset break up.

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:47.287
Tuska, tuska, makes it
sound like Barbarian.

01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:50.133
With the new loan you
buy back your old assets

01:13:50.159 --> 01:13:52.751
and then sell off the brand
and the Pop & Sons table.

01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:55.851
And you know how to
squeeze the value harry.

01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:59.964
That's a break up.
- Please, I know what it is.

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:02.447
The pita bread, the cake,
they get sold to a bakery.

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:04.762
The Halloumi and Feta 
to a dairy company.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.686
I love your Halloumi!
Grilled, it's...

01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:12.161
The sell off value of these
brands will exced the new loan.

01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:15.889
So, my bank will get its money back
faster than you can say knife.

01:14:15.915 --> 01:14:17.376
And what do you get?

01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:21.046
Lars wants 50% of the Plaza development.

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:24.571
Which is what would remain
after the debt has been settled.

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:29.004
So you get 50% of the development for free?
- Sure, yeah.

01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:32.535
Would you get 50% of the
same development, yeah.

01:14:32.661 --> 01:14:33.767
Also for free.

01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:38.965
What do you want, Harry?
- I want my food busines back.

01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:42.330
Guys, guys, guys reality check.
Harry, it's not gonna happen.

01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:46.761
Ok, the best you can hope for is to
work with Lars here and save something.

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:51.242
Can't say no.

01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:55.073
Okay, so I need to take
this to the board.

01:14:55.099 --> 01:14:57.632
Takes 2-3 months, but pischa.

01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:02.805
It seems criminal to buy
the business back only to break it up.

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:07.012
Can I just point out
that you are skating,

01:15:07.038 --> 01:15:09.392
figuratively speaking
on thin fucking ice.

01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:18.250
I'll do what ever the bank wants.
- Ok.

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:22.648
Harry, we are gonna
take this to the hoop.

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:24.888
Three points!

01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:32.847
Taking out a loan
to pay off a loan,

01:15:33.373 --> 01:15:35.394
so you can remortgage
a property.

01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:37.655
It's got nothing
to do with business.

01:15:37.681 --> 01:15:40.193
It's got nothing to
do with making stuff.

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:42.115
I'd get my life back.

01:15:42.141 --> 01:15:45.232
No, you get a
loan for some land.

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:48.051
My children get their lifes back.

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:51.725
I'm sorry.
This isn't very profesional.

01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:54.446
Do you give your client
a hard time Sophie?

01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:56.440
No.

01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:00.127
Just the interesting ones.

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:04.642
You've got 5 minutes.
- Yeah, of course.

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:06.702
I just want to
about the shop and..

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:11.768
make sure that my brother
got the right plan for a girl.

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:15.964
Okay, lets grab a cup of coffee.

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:19.400
So, it's 30% of material.

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:23.008
The fish, the potatoes, the packaging, etc.

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:27.762
Would you include energy?
Light, heat?

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:31.328
Yeah. But not rent, because
we already own the building.

01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:36.242
Okay. And 30% on labour?
- Yeah.

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:39.508
So it's 30-30-30 classic
restaurant model.

01:16:39.534 --> 01:16:40.675
That's right.

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:44.802
What are your weakneses?

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:50.804
Price of fish can vary dramatically.

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.520
Can you vary the menu?

01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:56.522
You don't want it complicated.

01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:00.331
Doesn't have to be 
complicated, Harry.

01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:08.968
What are your fears?
- My fears?

01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:21.491
Just that it won't work out.

01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:28.681
That Fish & Chips
maybe had its day.

01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:31.845
No. Hang on a second..

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.482
Fish & Chips, it's a British classic.

01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:38.574
Much more than just a quick

01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:40.512
meaningless experience, it's...

01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:43.043
something to be savored.

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:47.481
Just think of the soft 
white cod flakes

01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:50.943
gently falling away as
your fork pierces the

01:17:50.969 --> 01:17:53.832
heart crunchy shell
of the golden batter.

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:57.375
The rich smell of the
friers delight, the

01:17:57.401 --> 01:18:00.031
tangy smack of salt and
vinegar on your lips.

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:02.684
Hell yeah!

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.241
I'd pay for that.

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:13.687
And we should 
talk about um...

01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:16.411
We should talk about 
a cunning packages. - Yeah.

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:37.205
Yeah, we should.

01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:40.432
This time last year
I was in Malibu.

01:18:40.458 --> 01:18:42.876
We'll go tonight.

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:46.289
It's not a night club. 
It's America.

01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:51.546
Look, the shop's where I'm from.
But..

01:18:51.572 --> 01:18:53.634
it's not where I'm gonna end up.

01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:57.402
My dad, must've said 
that to my mom once.

01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:00.277
Maybe even on this bridge.

01:19:00.303 --> 01:19:02.913
Silly, look where he ended up.

01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:07.846
So what's your plan?

01:19:07.872 --> 01:19:10.907
Property. Got an eye for it.

01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:16.206
I'll probably be a Popstar one day.
- Cool.

01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:20.323
Yo, yo, yo, it's time to die.
Yoyo blue buterfly.

01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:22.326
He was fat, he was bloated.

01:19:22.352 --> 01:19:24.510
He was fairly attracted 
to my lapple.

01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:28.088
That is wild sick!

01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:33.845
I wrote something for you too.

01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:35.716
It's a poem. It's called:

01:19:35.742 --> 01:19:37.911
"Sometimes I want for nothing else."

01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:42.939
Just you and me, in an
ever expanding universe,

01:19:43.065 --> 01:19:45.307
shagging cup of tea.

01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:47.084
Sometimes
I want for nothing else.

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:52.090
Fuck.
You're amazing.

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:07.090
Start from the side fin
on the top here.

01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:13.771
And cut in one move 
all along the fish.

01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:39.490
Lovely come and try.

01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:43.658
Fresh fish lovely of
chips, delicious fish.

01:20:43.684 --> 01:20:44.669
Come and try.

01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:47.783
Pickle boy!
Battered inside.

01:20:47.820 --> 01:20:51.424
Special chips for you. And one for you.
Off you go.

01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:53.702
Fish and Chips come and try.

01:20:53.728 --> 01:20:55.675
We batter our own fish.

01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:59.361
We make beautiful fresh fish inside.
Sir, have a chip. Have a fish.

01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:02.404
No? None for you.
Sir, come and try. Come and try.

01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:04.720
It's not just Fish and Chips.

01:21:04.746 --> 01:21:07.228
There's room for all of us.

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:12.121
What do you want, Hassan?

01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:15.489
Remember when we were children?
When we were friends?

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:19.089
We weren't Greeks, Turks.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.482
Respectfuly I would like you
to take your kebabs off the menu.

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:28.162
This is Fish and Chips shop.

01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:30.444
What do we get?

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:34.243
I want to fish.

01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:39.508
You don't do fishes.

01:21:39.534 --> 01:21:41.788
You're going to put us on the street.

01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:45.405
It's business.
- It's not about business!

01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:48.240
Perhaps you wouldn't be
like this, if we were Greeks.

01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:55.002
I'd tell you what.

01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:58.122
We'll take kebabs off the menu...

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:02.685
if you ask your son to
stay away from my daughter.

01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:11.526
More tea?
- No, thank you.

01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:15.008
This is very difficult.
- Come on, it's easy.

01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:18.609
My son is his own man.
- Right, no deal.

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:21.558
Is this because he's Turkish?
Because he's a muslim?

01:22:21.584 --> 01:22:23.353
Oh, no. I don't
have a problem.

01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:25.016
Harry's not make bet.

01:22:25.042 --> 01:22:27.954
Because he works in
a kebab shop, is that it?

01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:30.248
Yeah, Harry's more like that.

01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:34.246
I'd ask you, both of you. To respect
a mans aspiration for his daughter.

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:38.170
I have similar aspiration for my son.

01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:43.447
Spiro? Perhaps you should remind
your brother where he is now.

01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:45.643
Tell him to look around.

01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:50.005
Perhaps he still sees a big mansion
with big garden and servants.

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:52.165
Well, I don't.

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:55.125
But more importantly,
neither did my son.

01:22:55.151 --> 01:22:58.236
This is only temporary, we'll
be gone in a couple of months.

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:00.484
I hope so.

01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:04.401
It's gonna be long couple of months.
- For both of us.

01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:05.921
Say cheese!

01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:16.729
So here we are.

01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:20.126
Here we are.

01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:28.041
I'm sure it'd be good news.

01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:30.811
If it's good news, Spiro.
I want you to have the shop.

01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:33.844
All of it.

01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:39.040
Will we get to visit uncle Spiros again?
- Of course we will.

01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:42.847
Who's gonna help run the store?
I'm gonna need you little man.

01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:46.921
I'd expect uncle Spiros will
always find you a holiday job.

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:54.091
Hallo.

01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:56.006
Lars, yeah.

01:25:58.480 --> 01:25:59.606
Just, I'm just...

01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:25.564
What is it?
- Did you get the loan?

01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:31.726
Bad news i'm afraid.
- Realy? - Yeah.

01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:35.446
We're going home, we got it!

01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:41.641
We're going home.
- Congratulation.

01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:45.970
What's wrong?

01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:50.085
We're leaving. We're out of here.
We've got the loan.

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:55.644
We should be celebrating.
- Not here, he's right.

01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:58.088
It's a good day.

01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:00.607
You... you...

01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:03.845
made it!

01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:08.008
You're a survivor.

01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:10.841
Sorry.

01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:14.727
What is it with you Spiro?
Why can't you be happy for me?

01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:19.747
When ever I've any kind of success,
you always have to stamp on it.

01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:25.647
Where are you going?
- I am happy for you.

01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:27.851
I am.

01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:31.647
What is it?
What's wrong?

01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:34.690
There's this...

01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:05.884
He looks dead to me.

01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:09.164
No, he's not dead.
He's sleeping. He's still sleeping

01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:11.251
Like...

01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:13.927
Sleeping beauty?
- Yeah.

01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:16.968
It's a good way looking at him.

01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:29.889
Sorry.

01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:34.488
I hope I'm not...
- No, come in.

01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:36.571
James? James!

01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:42.089
And take the um...

01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:45.329
Yeah, I heard the news, and
I realy wanted to bake something.

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:48.285
So I made a 
Greek easter cake.

01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:51.844
Don't ask.
- No, that's really...

01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:55.045
lovely. Thank you very much.
We'll have some of that.

01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:57.645
James.

01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:00.122
He's in a mild koma apparently,

01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:03.841
and we have to talk to
him and play music and uh..

01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:05.525
James, put the...

01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:08.049
turn the music on.

01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:10.469
Hey, wake up!

01:29:11.895 --> 01:29:14.313
The accountant's here,
you better wake up.

01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:17.447
James!
- He's a coin!

01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:19.770
Katie!
- Sorry.

01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:22.642
Don't just stand up, you..

01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:24.245
Let me do it.

01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:27.091
Wait, I felt something.
Katie, get the doctor.

01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:29.803
I don't want them to ask.

01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:34.406
Oh, for fuck sake. I'll do it.
- James!

01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:36.569
Excuse me...

01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:39.161
Doctor I felt something just
now, a gripping movement.

01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:40.769
Anything else?

01:29:40.795 --> 01:29:43.555
No, just a slight squeeze.

01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:44.865
Is that a sign?

01:29:45.291 --> 01:29:48.148
It could be, the court can't respon.
It's difficult to tell.

01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:50.526
Right.

01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:55.402
How long is he 
gonna be like this?

01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:59.002
He suffered a heart attack.
It's hard to predict.

01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:05.529
You should all take a break.

01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:08.003
I'm sorry about him.

01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:13.491
Yeah, we'll leave him to you.
Say good bye to uncle Spiros.

01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:17.567
Come on, it's ok.

01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:25.487
Would you mind staying around, Sophie?
- Of course.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.641
So he saved me twice. Once in
the fire, and once after the bank.

01:30:57.840 --> 01:30:59.994
I was always embarrassed
by him you know.

01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:01.506
By these things that he does.

01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:03.285
You know his thing.

01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:08.086
But the things that he does,
it's a good thing really.

01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:18.642
These last few months...

01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:22.244
This year actualy...
This whole year. The whole year.

01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:28.604
What a year.

01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:33.082
And yet...

01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:37.203
I've never felt so alive,
I never felt so engaged.

01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:40.724
Why is that?

01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:43.048
I mean why?
I'm frying chips!

01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:48.964
I love him.

01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:52.248
I've always loved him.

01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:57.642
And I love my children.

01:31:57.840 --> 01:31:59.205
I love...

01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:01.368
I love my live, I love it.

01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:06.409
Why is that? Why do I love it now?
What's wrong with before?

01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:11.170
It's okay.

01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:14.233
It's a crazy, crazy world.
It's up, It's down.

01:32:14.259 --> 01:32:16.067
You fight, you win, you lose..

01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:18.971
Become exhausted, 
then you leave.

01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:22.340
It's not logic. It's not logic,

01:32:22.366 --> 01:32:24.394
it's insane. It's insane.

01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:27.890
The whole thing.

01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:39.405
No, no, no Spiros.
- I'll get some one.

01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:57.208
You have to let me go.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.843
Michael is with us.

01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:06.211
Michael.

01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:09.566
Michael was always there.

01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:12.370
Always with us.

01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:14.571
Always.

01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:17.563
Three Brothers.

01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:24.607
When I was a little boy.

01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:30.121
You cooked for me,
everytime I came home.

01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:35.007
They were good time, Spiro.

01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:37.484
<i>Ef_charistó_</i>
(Thank you)

01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:42.002
<i>kalí_ zo_í_</i>
Good life.

01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:47.205
Now you understand.

01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:25.083
Did you do this?

01:35:26.860 --> 01:35:30.660
It was for you and uncle Spiros.
And Mum.

01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:42.443
Thank you, James.

01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:49.960
It's the ivy you saved that night.

01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:53.244
We meet again.

01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:00.969
Did you know about this?

01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:04.768
They can move back to
the house if you want.

01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:07.885
The plants, they quite easy to move.

01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:12.085
But they also very happy to...

01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:15.286
grow here, as well.
If we choose to stay.

01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:25.880
It's what ever 
you want to do, Daddy.

01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:30.166
We're really proud of you.

01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:08.840
Thank you.

01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:12.601
Theo. Good day at school?
- Very good day.

01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:17.251
Impress the teacher with his
ability to solve quadratic equation.

01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:18.991
That is fantastic.

01:37:19.017 --> 01:37:21.515
Your friends are outside.

01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:32.459
Because you won't come to me,
I thought I come to you.

01:37:32.485 --> 01:37:33.775
I'm not changing my mind, Rob.

01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:36.250
I just want to talk.

01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:39.008
Tell me this is a joke.

01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:46.449
I don't want to do the deal.

01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:49.803
Harry, you have seriously
lost the plot on this one.

01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:51.745
It just doesn't feel right.

01:37:51.771 --> 01:37:54.149
We worked hard on this.

01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:56.800
If he doesn't wanna do the deal.
He doesn't wanna do it.

01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:59.128
Shut up!
- Hey!

01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:03.006
No need for that.
- I don't understand.

01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:06.207
I've got everything I want.
And I've got no debt.

01:38:06.233 --> 01:38:07.435
And that feels good.

01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:10.353
When I lock up my shop at night,
it feels good

01:38:10.379 --> 01:38:12.008
I've got no...

01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:15.228
debt, no loans. I own it.

01:38:15.254 --> 01:38:16.395
100%.

01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:18.441
Come on.

01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:20.245
A percentage of
something that could be

01:38:20.271 --> 01:38:23.214
worth millions, you
walk away from that?

01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:27.521
For chips shop?
- Yeah. Right now yeah, I would.

01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:31.847
And I'm with my children.
And that's...

01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:35.042
Can't put a price on that, Rob.

01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:37.689
And I'm having fun.

01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:39.530
We're having fun.

01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:42.646
Come back to the shop, let me
get you something to eat.

01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:46.250
Come, we're doing
great business.

01:38:46.276 --> 01:38:48.508
I'm actualy thinking
of expanding.

01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:50.205
That's a...

01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:54.525
That's good Harry, that's very good.
I'm happy for you.

01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:58.288
If this is succsess.

01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:03.049
What is succsessas, Rob?
What is it?

01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:07.647
We both had it, what is it?

01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:10.874
Is it the share price?
Is it the profit earning ratio?

01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:13.554
Is it beautiful car?

01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:15.701
You tell me Harry.
You had it all.

01:39:16.327 --> 01:39:18.733
Yeah, I have. 
And I can tell you.

01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:21.483
Succsess...

01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:24.805
is...

01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:27.611
the joy you feel.

01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:34.188
That's it. That's all it is.

01:39:34.214 --> 01:39:36.514
Succsess is the joy you feel.

01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:44.285
Come on, lets go.

01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:46.530
I don't think so.

01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:50.331
Okay, I'm sorry I shouted at you.

01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:52.689
I don't care about that.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.651
I just don't wanna
work for you anymore.

01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:02.567
Good luck people.

01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:37.966

01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:44.930
No, I can't. I actualy can't.

01:42:47.240 --> 01:42:49.891

I just don't know how.

01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:53.924

- "Make it up." - Come on, Harry.

01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:57.769

01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:20.241

just comes back to you.

01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:37.890
