WEBVTT

00:00.772 --> 00:02.642
Previously on Pretty Little Liars...

00:02.643 --> 00:05.040
I may not agree with the
way Ezra lives his life,

00:05.041 --> 00:08.183
but I'm not gonna stand
by and let you ruin him.

00:11.205 --> 00:12.817
I also made my dad a collage,

00:12.818 --> 00:14.314
and there was a picture of her on a boat.

00:14.315 --> 00:15.353
That's the one. Cece told

00:15.354 --> 00:17.056
you she didn't know him? Why did she lie?

00:17.057 --> 00:18.538
I haven't told you guys the truth.

00:18.539 --> 00:20.425
What truth? Toby and I broke up.

00:20.426 --> 00:23.428
Are you okay? I'm about to meet my son.

00:28.759 --> 00:29.977
Mona sent you, didn't she?

00:29.978 --> 00:33.052
Spencer, she recognizes
self-destructive aggressive behavior.

00:33.053 --> 00:35.546
And who's looking cray cray now, Spencer?

00:35.547 --> 00:37.020
Die!

00:38.882 --> 00:40.162
Stay at my place. No.

00:40.163 --> 00:42.494
Yes. You'll sleep on our couch.

00:43.741 --> 00:45.539
You can make that jump.

00:47.012 --> 00:48.496
No!

00:48.497 --> 00:49.653
Jason!

00:49.654 --> 00:51.520
The patient in bed three,
Jason DiLaurentis,

00:51.521 --> 00:52.943
where'd he go?

01:04.944 --> 01:06.676
How you holding up, em?

01:07.305 --> 01:10.268
Don't think I'll be taking
an elevator any time soon.

01:10.523 --> 01:12.327
Any word from Jason?

01:12.340 --> 01:14.234
No. Nothing.

01:16.562 --> 01:18.906
Okay, so now that the whole N.A.T.
Club is out of Rosewood,

01:18.907 --> 01:21.023
do you think that "a" will retire?

01:21.024 --> 01:22.709
Or just have more time for us.

01:22.710 --> 01:24.621
Way to think positive, Spence.

01:24.622 --> 01:27.766
I just doubt suddenly everything's
gonna be lilacs and daffodils.

01:27.767 --> 01:29.344
Guys, let's focus.

01:29.345 --> 01:30.760
Cece lied about knowing Wilden,

01:30.761 --> 01:32.810
and then we find a picture
of both of them with Ali.

01:32.811 --> 01:35.111
Yeah, a picture that's gone now.

01:35.193 --> 01:36.501
New rule. Next time we see

01:36.502 --> 01:38.734
anything that might be
important to us down the road,

01:38.735 --> 01:40.058
it goes in the phone.

01:40.059 --> 01:43.639
Okay, so is it possible that Cece is...

01:43.640 --> 01:46.321
What are we calling her, red coat?

01:46.557 --> 01:47.917
I never saw a face.

01:47.918 --> 01:49.539
Yeah, me neither.

01:52.573 --> 01:54.148
What do you think, Spencer?

01:56.778 --> 01:59.695
Blonde? Red coat? Captain of the "a" team?

01:59.921 --> 02:01.374
Maybe it's Cece.

02:01.375 --> 02:06.256
Pay attention. We need this brain
trust firing on all cylinders.

02:09.008 --> 02:11.185
What happened tonight with you and Wren?

02:15.328 --> 02:17.494
It's nothing. I...

02:17.986 --> 02:20.681
Mona and I had a... moment,

02:20.682 --> 02:23.301
and, uh, he saw, that's all.

02:23.856 --> 02:27.218
A moment that might make her
try and cut Emily in half?

02:27.219 --> 02:29.893
No. No, you guys, this wasn't Mona.

02:29.894 --> 02:31.955
We were in a different county.

02:31.956 --> 02:34.103
Well, then who do you think it was?

02:50.639 --> 02:51.948
We're closed.

02:51.949 --> 02:53.740
You're here. I have the keys.

02:53.741 --> 02:56.302
Yeah, and drinking coffee's not a crime.

02:56.651 --> 02:57.640
What are you doing here?

02:57.641 --> 02:58.832
Looking for you girls.

02:58.833 --> 03:00.411
Wait, you were following us?

03:00.412 --> 03:03.900
Jason DiLaurentis has been saying
some nasty things about me.

03:03.901 --> 03:04.889
Like what?

03:04.890 --> 03:06.559
Don't play dumb, Hanna.

03:06.560 --> 03:08.537
It wouldn't be the first
time you made up a story.

03:08.538 --> 03:10.082
Well, I don't know what
you're talking about.

03:10.083 --> 03:12.043
So why don't you just leave us alone.

03:12.044 --> 03:14.240
It's just a question. No
need to get so defensive.

03:14.241 --> 03:16.050
Why don't you ask Cece Drake? Hanna.

03:16.051 --> 03:19.279
We know about the little boat
ride you two took with Alison.

03:24.541 --> 03:25.896
It's late.

03:25.897 --> 03:27.643
We were just leaving.

03:27.703 --> 03:29.453
Care for a ride?

03:29.524 --> 03:30.919
It's not safe this time of night.

03:30.920 --> 03:32.328
We're good.

03:35.796 --> 03:37.214
Oh, and Hanna...

03:38.779 --> 03:40.337
See you around.

04:01.385 --> 04:06.285

04:30.208 --> 04:32.306
Is Caleb having fun with his dad?

04:32.481 --> 04:34.695
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

04:35.431 --> 04:38.802
Wow. After all the hurdles you
went through to get them together,

04:38.946 --> 04:40.474
I thought you'd be more enthusiastic.

04:40.475 --> 04:42.816
They're just stripping fixtures
at his aunt's house...

04:42.817 --> 04:44.770
Copper pipes are not that exciting.

04:44.771 --> 04:47.153
Am I missing something? No.

04:47.542 --> 04:49.692
Look, mom, you're gonna be late for work.

04:50.863 --> 04:52.055
Just get in the car.

04:52.056 --> 04:54.424
What is going on? What?

05:14.362 --> 05:16.303
Hanna, what's going on?

05:16.304 --> 05:17.262
Nothing.

05:17.263 --> 05:19.121
That wasn't nothing.

05:20.266 --> 05:22.705
I-I just know the girl who got in his car.

05:22.706 --> 05:24.372
That doesn't explain the
look he just gave you.

05:24.373 --> 05:26.171
I-I don't know, mom, all right?

05:26.172 --> 05:28.403
Wilden's a freak. He hates us.

05:29.292 --> 05:31.359
Hanna, did he talk to you
again without me being there?

05:31.360 --> 05:32.433
Because Veronica hasting
said he wasn't allowed...

05:32.434 --> 05:34.342
no, it's fine.

05:35.564 --> 05:37.323
Okay. I'll talk to him myself then.

05:37.324 --> 05:38.248
No!

05:38.249 --> 05:39.327
You're not giving me a choice.

05:39.328 --> 05:41.091
Well, you can't.

05:41.590 --> 05:45.353
We're just trying to figure
out why he's always after us.

05:47.004 --> 05:48.301
Okay.

05:50.473 --> 05:53.969
So we were thinking that
maybe Wilden and Ali

05:53.970 --> 05:55.889
had a relationship.

05:56.333 --> 05:58.588
What kind of relationship?

06:00.306 --> 06:02.521
Oh, my God, Hanna.

06:02.522 --> 06:04.149
Why did you even go there?

06:04.150 --> 06:06.081
Mom, I told you it was a dumb theory.

06:06.082 --> 06:08.196
No wonder he's upset.

06:08.197 --> 06:11.073
You can't go around saying
those things about people,

06:11.074 --> 06:12.763
no matter how much you don't like them.

06:12.764 --> 06:14.046
Well, don't worry about it.

06:14.047 --> 06:15.950
It all started when that
girl got in his car,

06:15.951 --> 06:17.339
and I already told Wilden.

06:17.340 --> 06:18.755
So it's over.

06:18.756 --> 06:20.333
How do you even know this person?

06:20.334 --> 06:21.943
She was friends with Ali.

06:21.944 --> 06:24.218
She's a one-woman rumor factory.

06:24.219 --> 06:24.865
All right, well, I don't

06:24.866 --> 06:26.799
want you associating
with her anymore, okay?

06:26.800 --> 06:29.863
Okay. Never again. Gladly.

06:29.864 --> 06:31.642
I have to go meet Emily.

06:43.872 --> 06:46.710
Oh, my God. You're still in bed?

06:48.796 --> 06:50.639
Mom and dad called.

06:51.931 --> 06:54.897
I didn't tell them you've
been skipping school.

06:57.554 --> 07:00.716
Any idea how much longer
I'll be covering for you?

07:04.649 --> 07:07.778
If they call again, I'm
telling them the truth.

07:13.442 --> 07:14.787
You told your mom?

07:14.788 --> 07:17.110
Don't worry about it. We're fine.
I covered for us.

07:17.111 --> 07:19.852
What were you thinking? You can't
tell her something like that.

07:19.853 --> 07:22.761
I was distracted by Cece and Wilden, okay?

07:23.152 --> 07:25.512
It doesn't make sense. I thought
she was protecting him.

07:25.513 --> 07:26.623
Well, what if we were wrong,

07:26.624 --> 07:29.847
and I just set Ali's baby
daddy/killer on her tail?

07:29.848 --> 07:32.228
Why would she lie about knowing him?

07:32.280 --> 07:34.971
We have to find out the truth...
confront her.

07:34.972 --> 07:36.871
Where? In Wilden's trunk?

07:36.872 --> 07:38.116
He wouldn't grab her in broad daylight

07:38.117 --> 07:39.867
if he was gonna hurt her.

07:39.868 --> 07:41.320
Probably.

07:41.966 --> 07:43.380
Have you heard from Jason?

07:43.381 --> 07:45.086
He texted. He's laying low

07:45.087 --> 07:47.612
at a friend's place in
Virginia for a while.

07:47.735 --> 07:49.305
I kinda wish he took me with him.

07:49.306 --> 07:50.545
Did you tell Paige that she almost

07:50.546 --> 07:52.505
got two Emilys for the price of one?

07:52.506 --> 07:53.482
Are you kidding?

07:53.483 --> 07:56.154
She's worried enough about me as it is.

07:56.838 --> 07:59.082
Do you think Paige and Caleb
have told us everything?

07:59.083 --> 08:00.184
I mean, with them digging into Mona,

08:00.185 --> 08:02.152
do you think they found out
something that we could use?

08:02.153 --> 08:04.780
"A" almost killed me. I am
not exposing Paige to that.

08:04.781 --> 08:06.071
No, of course not.

08:06.072 --> 08:07.350
But would it hurt to find out

08:07.351 --> 08:09.593
if she picked up anything useful?

08:10.868 --> 08:14.041
Yeah, I-I guess we could go
and talk to her after school.

08:14.487 --> 08:16.273
How is Caleb, anyway?

08:16.274 --> 08:18.033
Everything go okay with the reunion?

08:18.034 --> 08:20.216
Yeah. Yeah, mostly.

08:20.469 --> 08:22.068
What part isn't?

08:23.948 --> 08:26.399
I don't know. This weird thing happened.

08:26.438 --> 08:28.741
I put a five dollar bill in
the church collection box,

08:28.742 --> 08:31.363
and it had some dice drawn on it.

08:31.443 --> 08:33.902
And later that day, Caleb's dad had it.

08:33.903 --> 08:35.681
You gave money to a church?

08:35.682 --> 08:37.775
Emily, I'm serious.

08:37.889 --> 08:39.852
Do you know how much
money has writing on it?

08:39.854 --> 08:42.301
George Washington has dreadlocks
on like half my tips.

08:42.302 --> 08:44.083
Yeah, I know, but what
if it was the same one.

08:44.085 --> 08:45.225
The guy's an ex-con.

08:45.226 --> 08:47.089
Hanna, do you really think he would steal

08:47.090 --> 08:49.256
from the place that just hired him?

08:49.495 --> 08:51.579
We need to find out the truth.

08:52.855 --> 08:54.533
Hey, Wes.

08:55.097 --> 08:57.659
Look, I think that we should talk...

09:00.651 --> 09:02.024
Ezra.

09:09.319 --> 09:11.096
When did you get back?

09:11.114 --> 09:13.192
3 this morning.

09:13.193 --> 09:15.604
I crashed as soon as I got in.

09:16.061 --> 09:17.588
I just woke up.

09:18.581 --> 09:20.900
I haven't been sleeping
much the past few weeks.

09:20.901 --> 09:22.385
Yeah, me neither.

09:24.996 --> 09:28.198
I guess I'm just a little confused on why

09:28.199 --> 09:31.411
you never called me on one
of those sleepless nights.

09:31.825 --> 09:34.334
Aria, my life turned upside down.

09:34.335 --> 09:38.004
I needed some time to think about things.

09:39.008 --> 09:40.603
Things like us?

09:40.957 --> 09:42.309
For one.

09:42.385 --> 09:45.916
I mean, not about my
feelings for you, obviously.

09:45.917 --> 09:47.450
Obviously.

09:47.544 --> 09:48.557
What is that supposed to mean?

09:48.558 --> 09:50.895
Ezra, you've been radio
silent ever since you left.

09:50.896 --> 09:53.664
It's given me nothing to
do but fear the worst.

09:53.665 --> 09:55.435
That you'd moved on. No.

09:55.436 --> 09:58.874
Aria, no. If-if anything, I
was trying to be fair to you

09:58.875 --> 10:01.268
and not drag you into the middle of this.

10:01.269 --> 10:02.342
I already am.

10:02.343 --> 10:04.380
And I feel terrible about that.

10:04.381 --> 10:06.419
Because this isn't... this
isn't what you signed up for.

10:06.420 --> 10:09.110
That's not your decision
to make, it's mine.

10:11.779 --> 10:13.086
You're right.

10:13.755 --> 10:14.742
You're right. I'm sorry.

10:14.743 --> 10:18.391
I shut you out, and that was wrong.

10:22.275 --> 10:23.885
How was your trip?

10:24.271 --> 10:27.382
"Surreal" definitely comes to mind.

10:27.618 --> 10:29.040
But, uh...

10:29.041 --> 10:30.802
Malcolm's amazing.

10:31.031 --> 10:35.661
He's smart, lively, really artistic.

10:37.704 --> 10:40.065
Did Maggie ever tell you
why she kept it a secret?

10:40.066 --> 10:40.991
She did.

10:40.992 --> 10:42.939
My mother paid her to keep quiet.

10:42.940 --> 10:44.769
That's disgusting.

10:45.127 --> 10:45.982
Sorry.

10:45.983 --> 10:47.353
No, no, you're right, and believe me,

10:47.354 --> 10:50.136
I gave her an earful over the phone.

10:52.765 --> 10:55.272
Can I bring you up to speed over dinner?

10:55.530 --> 10:56.977
I never would have said
this prior to meeting you,

10:56.978 --> 11:00.307
but I've actually been
craving vegan takeout.

11:03.361 --> 11:06.144
I want you in my life, Aria.

11:06.657 --> 11:08.132
Every part of it.

11:08.133 --> 11:09.504
If you're willing.

11:18.014 --> 11:19.783
I just missed you.

11:20.641 --> 11:22.471
I missed you, too.

11:27.133 --> 11:28.966
What happened with Wes?

11:29.514 --> 11:30.829
When you came in, you were on the phone.

11:30.830 --> 11:31.984
Said you needed to talk.

11:31.985 --> 11:35.599
Oh, right, yeah. No, nothing. We, um...

11:35.732 --> 11:37.786
He helped me with a shoot the other night,

11:37.787 --> 11:41.454
and we messed up some
stuff at Cece's store.

11:41.455 --> 11:42.812
It was nothing.

11:44.951 --> 11:46.231
Ok

11:47.612 --> 11:48.890
I'm gonna be late for school.

11:48.891 --> 11:50.077
Okay.

12:14.728 --> 12:16.245
Spencer?

12:16.842 --> 12:18.696
Hey. Sorry.

12:18.697 --> 12:21.587
I just wanted to spend my
free period in the quiet.

12:21.588 --> 12:23.895
I haven't seen you in a few days.

12:23.896 --> 12:27.043
Yeah. Bad week.

12:28.745 --> 12:30.578
I understand if you don't
want me in your classroom.

12:30.579 --> 12:33.138
No, it's okay. I don't mind.

12:34.528 --> 12:36.590
Do you feel like talking?

12:42.014 --> 12:44.301
Well, I guess you've heard...

12:44.536 --> 12:45.839
About Mona.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.084
Mrs. horowitz wanted you suspended,

12:48.085 --> 12:51.726
but Mona said it was
just a misunderstanding.

12:53.145 --> 12:56.060
Spencer, I've known you most of your life.

12:56.201 --> 12:57.694
And you've always been the kind of person

12:57.695 --> 13:01.508
who would bounce back from disappointment.

13:03.015 --> 13:05.415
I've never seen you this down.

13:06.182 --> 13:09.612
Yeah, well, people change.

13:16.821 --> 13:17.643
I'm sorry.

13:17.644 --> 13:20.151
No, don't apologize.

13:20.486 --> 13:23.536
Break-ups are terrible. I get it.

13:25.904 --> 13:28.210
Um, I should probably get going.

13:28.560 --> 13:32.567
Um, if you wanna spend any more
of your free periods here,

13:32.568 --> 13:34.440
my door is open.

13:35.684 --> 13:37.513
Thanks, miss Montgomery.

13:56.118 --> 13:57.335
What's up?

13:57.823 --> 13:59.289
Just heading home.

14:02.156 --> 14:03.967
Rosewood costume shop?

14:04.212 --> 14:06.425
Yeah, I-I thought I'd check in with Shana

14:06.426 --> 14:08.592
about those queen of hearts
costumes on the way.

14:08.593 --> 14:10.239
You said you were done with this.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.666
I know. I am.

14:11.667 --> 14:13.041
Liar.

14:14.843 --> 14:16.110
I'm following up.

14:16.111 --> 14:18.821
She said the inventory
could take a few weeks.

14:19.351 --> 14:20.523
Great. We'll come with.

14:20.524 --> 14:22.170
Emily, no.

14:27.076 --> 14:29.210
The whole point of this is
that I'm protecting you,

14:29.211 --> 14:30.388
not the other way around.

14:30.389 --> 14:33.870
No. Doing things alone is what
gets us in trouble. Let's go.

14:34.527 --> 14:35.942
Are you this hard on Caleb?

14:35.943 --> 14:38.350
Seriously? You're looking
for sympathy from the girl

14:38.351 --> 14:40.855
who's boyfriend took a bullet in the gut?

15:06.172 --> 15:07.630
Spencer?

15:08.138 --> 15:09.256
Is everything okay?

15:12.000 --> 15:13.301
I know that you're in there.

15:15.638 --> 15:16.470
I'm fine.

15:16.908 --> 15:18.193
Come on, open up the door.

15:19.475 --> 15:21.561
You're not the only one that could
use a little team "Sparia."

15:25.454 --> 15:26.262
Ezra's back.

15:38.500 --> 15:39.224
Spencer...

15:40.341 --> 15:42.134
I know that you don't
want a friend right now,

15:42.135 --> 15:44.258
but that doesn't mean that
your friends don't need you.

16:08.051 --> 16:10.097
I still don't understand why
you care about this costume.

16:11.540 --> 16:12.928
Some girl wore it on the train.

16:13.379 --> 16:16.281
We kinda tangled, and I
wanna know who it was.

16:17.918 --> 16:19.491
I'm Shana, by the way.

16:19.869 --> 16:21.254
Paige forgot her manners.

16:22.579 --> 16:23.560
Emily.

16:24.026 --> 16:26.307
Oh, so it's you in the flesh.

16:30.114 --> 16:30.974
I'm Hanna.

16:35.476 --> 16:36.407
About that costume...

16:36.775 --> 16:39.388
Yeah, I checked. We can't
give out that information.

16:39.869 --> 16:40.850
It'd be my ass.

16:41.609 --> 16:43.482
You didn't think to mention
this on the phone?

16:43.483 --> 16:44.909
Must have slipped my mind.

16:45.429 --> 16:47.353
I didn't realize you'd be
bringing your girlfriends.

16:54.488 --> 16:55.881
Do you have a restroom?

16:56.111 --> 16:56.908
In the back.

16:57.295 --> 16:58.044
Thanks.

17:00.701 --> 17:03.825
So where are the queen of
hearts costumes, anyway?

17:04.453 --> 17:05.941
I wanna see what all the fuss is about.

17:06.637 --> 17:07.281
Over here.

17:30.333 --> 17:31.414
Wow!

17:31.681 --> 17:32.693
This is really pretty.

17:33.376 --> 17:34.545
What is this, silk?

17:34.546 --> 17:35.715
Try polyester.

17:36.165 --> 17:36.870
Oh.

17:41.854 --> 17:43.339
I'm really into fashion.

17:44.034 --> 17:45.734
Okay, I'd love to chat, but... no!

17:45.735 --> 17:46.862
Wait. Um...

17:48.411 --> 17:49.734
What's this?

17:50.764 --> 17:51.737
Little boy blue.

17:52.290 --> 17:53.083
Oh.

17:53.487 --> 17:56.030
Yeah, I really, really love this color.

18:07.794 --> 18:08.735
I have to get that.

18:09.053 --> 18:10.523
While you're with a customer?

18:14.466 --> 18:15.588
What is wrong with you?

18:19.942 --> 18:20.913
Costumes.

18:25.833 --> 18:26.582
Let's go.

18:38.871 --> 18:39.637
Aria.

18:41.671 --> 18:42.733
Mrs. Fitzgerald.

18:43.546 --> 18:45.012
I wanted to thank you.

18:45.873 --> 18:48.342
Whatever you said or did, it worked.

18:49.456 --> 18:50.301
Wesley's come home.

18:50.302 --> 18:51.905
He's going to be finishing
the year at dillard.

18:52.786 --> 18:56.235
Oh. Uh, I didn't do anything.

18:57.113 --> 18:59.770
Well, in any event, he's
back where he belongs.

19:01.280 --> 19:02.435
Do you mind if I sit?

19:08.878 --> 19:10.789
I know we didn't get off on the right foot,

19:12.908 --> 19:14.704
but your generosity toward my son

19:14.705 --> 19:16.755
in the midst of all this
does mean something.

19:17.755 --> 19:20.534
Yeah, well, Wes needed a place to stay.

19:20.535 --> 19:22.047
I wasn't gonna leave him out on the street.

19:24.407 --> 19:25.649
I meant Ezra.

19:27.242 --> 19:28.574
Wes stayed with you?

19:32.774 --> 19:34.436
I take it you've spoken with Ezra.

19:34.437 --> 19:36.468
I really don't wanna get
into the middle of this.

19:36.469 --> 19:38.487
I know this may sound hard to believe,

19:39.022 --> 19:41.245
but I was acting in Ezra's best interest.

19:41.246 --> 19:42.545
He was in high school.

19:42.546 --> 19:43.932
Just think of yourself, Aria.

19:44.998 --> 19:48.162
How would you feel waking up to
that kind of responsibility?

19:49.186 --> 19:52.375
My parents respect me enough
to involve me in the decision.

19:54.001 --> 19:55.050
I'm sure they do.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.730
I must admit, I admire your courage...

20:00.903 --> 20:03.527
staying with Ezra while his
life turns upside down.

20:03.528 --> 20:05.791
It will change things, to say the least.

20:05.792 --> 20:07.390
Especially for someone like Ezra.

20:07.648 --> 20:09.975
You know he'll make Malcolm
the center of his life.

20:10.425 --> 20:11.399
And there's Maggie...

20:21.479 --> 20:23.573
Well, I won't keep you.

20:35.233 --> 20:36.185
I love you, too.

20:38.621 --> 20:40.336
Caleb's gonna try and I.D.
the credit card numbers

20:40.337 --> 20:41.782
when he gets back from his aunt's house.

20:43.169 --> 20:43.820
What's wrong?

20:45.210 --> 20:47.013
Do you think Toby would
ever cheat on Spencer?

20:47.515 --> 20:48.309
Wait, what?

20:48.310 --> 20:49.566
It's the only thing I can think of

20:49.567 --> 20:51.394
that might explain how upset she's been.

20:51.395 --> 20:54.354
Toby is as loyal as a labrador.
I don't think he'd cheat.

20:55.551 --> 20:56.744
And neither would Paige.

20:59.041 --> 21:00.274
Who said anything about Paige?

21:00.275 --> 21:01.631
Uh, your face.

21:02.668 --> 21:04.669
I was only worried about it
when I saw her with Shana.

21:05.185 --> 21:06.955
There was some serious
tension in that room.

21:08.023 --> 21:09.528
Look, I know, and it's all my fault.

21:09.529 --> 21:11.663
I should have never put
that thought in your head.

21:12.814 --> 21:15.913
Are you even sure Shana's gay?
She barely looked at me.

21:15.914 --> 21:17.583
That's the criteria? I'm just saying.

21:17.584 --> 21:19.616
You should have seen those chicks
fighting over me at the bar.

21:20.317 --> 21:22.120
Anyway, it's like me and Caleb's dad.

21:22.559 --> 21:23.514
Just because we've all gotten

21:23.515 --> 21:24.890
in the habit of thinking
the worst of people

21:24.891 --> 21:25.895
doesn't mean it true.

21:33.527 --> 21:35.102
Is everything okay?

21:36.624 --> 21:37.460
Ezra's back.

21:38.958 --> 21:40.735
And so is miss Fitz-scary.

21:49.017 --> 21:50.068
Oh, I didn't order that.

21:50.947 --> 21:51.651
I did.

21:56.924 --> 21:57.873
Boyfriend busy?

22:00.001 --> 22:02.303
I am not gonna discuss my
personal life with you.

22:03.125 --> 22:04.618
I'm just trying to make small talk.

22:04.963 --> 22:07.207
Yet something tells me I
should have my lawyer present.

22:07.462 --> 22:09.274
No, there's no need to make it official.

22:12.292 --> 22:13.740
All right. You wanna talk? Talk.

22:14.049 --> 22:15.682
Don't get upset. I'm here as a friend.

22:16.280 --> 22:17.760
But we're not friends.

22:17.993 --> 22:18.995
We have a history.

22:20.942 --> 22:23.837
A history that's ancient,
as far as I'm concerned.

22:26.445 --> 22:28.333
Listen, I know my record isn't spotless,

22:29.055 --> 22:30.371
especially with you,

22:31.415 --> 22:33.285
but I take my job very seriously.

22:34.051 --> 22:35.615
I don't want anything to get in the way,

22:35.850 --> 22:37.423
especially something outrageous.

22:38.067 --> 22:38.899
Outrageous?

22:39.384 --> 22:43.553
Teenagers aren't aware of the
ramifications of what they say.

22:44.245 --> 22:46.352
If it's outrageous, why
do you seem so nervous?

22:46.419 --> 22:47.815
In a town like this,

22:48.392 --> 22:51.327
an accusation like that
would be the end of me.

22:52.699 --> 22:53.729
Is there any truth to it?

22:54.793 --> 22:56.819
Of course not.
What do you think?

23:01.720 --> 23:03.802
I think you bought a glass of wine
for the wrong person.

23:23.403 --> 23:24.371
Do you mind if I join you?

23:26.132 --> 23:26.972
No.

23:32.941 --> 23:35.297
I was hoping we could discuss
our little road trip.

23:36.685 --> 23:38.523
Look, I was wrong.

23:39.916 --> 23:44.274
You wanted to help me and I
used you to get at Mona.

23:46.333 --> 23:47.493
I'm sorry.

23:48.179 --> 23:49.024
You shouldn't be.

23:50.297 --> 23:51.544
I deserved to be used.

23:52.598 --> 23:55.878
Look, I'd be lying if I said I came to you

23:55.879 --> 23:57.751
purely in the name of mental health.

23:59.277 --> 24:01.101
Mona had told me about your break-up,

24:01.838 --> 24:02.764
and I think...

24:05.211 --> 24:07.716
I think that part of me hoped that
with Toby out of the picture,

24:08.895 --> 24:11.225
that I finally stood a chance.

24:13.945 --> 24:17.012
But it was wrong of me to try
and swoop in so quickly.

24:17.873 --> 24:19.411
I let feelings cloud my judgment.

24:22.191 --> 24:23.099
And I'm sorry.

24:26.121 --> 24:26.792
Thanks.

24:29.919 --> 24:31.440
Your anger toward Mona...

24:32.228 --> 24:34.300
Is she the one who came
between you and Toby?

24:35.393 --> 24:36.640
Yeah, you could say that.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.505
Forgive me. It's none of my business.

24:45.687 --> 24:46.564
I'll leave you.

24:49.669 --> 24:51.055
Wren, wait.

24:53.645 --> 24:55.301
It may have been about Mona,

24:55.302 --> 24:57.925
but something good came out of it.

24:59.598 --> 25:00.263
It was nice.

25:01.134 --> 25:02.001
Being with you.

25:04.103 --> 25:06.172
I'm glad I'm not the only
one of us who thought so.

25:09.455 --> 25:11.434
Do you fancy taking another stab at dinner?

25:12.598 --> 25:14.165
Anywhere but Lewisburg?

25:18.340 --> 25:20.461
Since when do you care what
that hose-beast thinks?

25:20.462 --> 25:21.661
She wasn't wrong, han.

25:21.930 --> 25:23.767
Now with Malcolm and Maggie in the picture,

25:23.768 --> 25:25.054
everything's gonna be complicated.

25:27.616 --> 25:29.393
God, how did this even happen?

25:30.642 --> 25:32.177
I mean, I'm actually having

25:32.178 --> 25:34.052
a conversation about my boyfriend's son.

25:34.659 --> 25:35.602
It's like my relationship

25:35.603 --> 25:37.617
went from high school to minivan overnight.

25:38.225 --> 25:39.414
And now-now I have to go

25:39.415 --> 25:40.968
to his apartment and have dinner with him

25:40.969 --> 25:42.029
and act like everything's okay.

25:42.030 --> 25:44.144
Okay, Aria, take a deep breath.

25:44.145 --> 25:46.583
Yeah, you have to give it
more than ten minutes.

25:47.106 --> 25:48.416
You guys have been through so much.

25:48.417 --> 25:49.147
I know.

25:50.334 --> 25:51.123
Okay, but don't you think

25:51.124 --> 25:52.835
it's a little weird that he didn't call?

25:52.836 --> 25:54.546
I mean, Wes even thought that was strange.

25:54.547 --> 25:55.679
Hold up. His little brother?

25:56.531 --> 25:58.185
Aria, is there something
that you're not telling us?

25:58.452 --> 25:59.331
What? No.

26:02.836 --> 26:04.423
Okay, yes, fine, maybe I went there

26:04.424 --> 26:07.226
for like 2.5 seconds, but no.

26:08.399 --> 26:10.217
No, I just missed Ezra.

26:10.713 --> 26:12.666
It seems like you're talking
to everyone in that family

26:12.667 --> 26:14.310
except for the one that matters.

26:19.264 --> 26:23.252
It was this beautiful crystal paperweight,

26:23.253 --> 26:26.443
with these lavender
petals suspended inside.

26:26.917 --> 26:28.635
I never would have pegged you as a thief.

26:29.423 --> 26:31.430
Well, I was a terrible one.

26:31.431 --> 26:35.047
I felt so guilty, as soon as I
got home from my Nana's house,

26:35.048 --> 26:35.968
that I actually...

26:37.122 --> 26:39.300
I buried it in the backyard.

26:40.686 --> 26:42.048
It's probably still there.

26:46.995 --> 26:48.188
I hate to cut the night short,

26:48.189 --> 26:50.303
but I promised a colleague
I'd cover his shift for him.

26:50.657 --> 26:53.465
Oh, go. Save some lives.

26:56.658 --> 26:57.660
I had a lovely night.

26:59.347 --> 27:00.528
Yeah, I did, too.

27:08.467 --> 27:09.094
I'm sorry.

27:28.051 --> 27:29.416
***
That's fair.

27:33.476 --> 27:34.646
I'll be on my way.

27:34.647 --> 27:35.994
Are you sure you don't want to tell Aria

27:35.995 --> 27:38.907
about how hiding my son from me
was in everyone's best interest?

27:39.144 --> 27:41.281
Best interest. That's what
you called it, right, mom?

27:41.282 --> 27:43.380
Malcolm's every need has been seen to.

27:43.381 --> 27:45.049
Oh, God. You're unbelievable.

27:45.359 --> 27:47.964
I can go... no, no, no. Stay, stay.

27:47.965 --> 27:49.891
We can continue this another time.

27:49.892 --> 27:51.256
Like when I'm alone? So you

27:51.257 --> 27:53.391
can try to manipulate Aria
out of my life again?

27:53.392 --> 27:55.313
Ezra, it's okay.

27:55.314 --> 27:56.808
No, it's not okay.

27:57.075 --> 27:58.170
I'm so sick of this.

27:58.171 --> 28:00.503
I'm not going to apologize for loving you.

28:00.790 --> 28:02.020
And I'm sure as hell not

28:02.021 --> 28:03.918
going to let you swoop into my son's life

28:03.919 --> 28:05.891
and pretend the past seven
years never happened.

28:09.559 --> 28:11.701
Well, you've made your
feelings perfectly clear.

28:14.828 --> 28:15.696
You're forgetting something.

28:17.622 --> 28:18.965
The key. I know you had one made.

28:35.319 --> 28:37.451
I am so sorry that you had to see that.

28:51.106 --> 28:52.743
Any idea why Shana got in trouble

28:52.744 --> 28:54.620
for emailing confidential information?

28:54.882 --> 28:56.856
I needed to find out who
rented those costumes.

28:56.857 --> 28:59.073
So badly you're willing
to risk somebody's job?

28:59.320 --> 29:01.348
It's complicated, okay? Try me.

29:04.078 --> 29:05.700
There's more to this
than you're letting on.

29:08.534 --> 29:09.757
Is it something about Mona?

29:11.048 --> 29:11.976
Did she kill Garrett?

29:12.372 --> 29:13.026
I don't know!

29:13.826 --> 29:16.082
Look, I know you and Caleb
are trying to bust her,

29:16.340 --> 29:18.286
but this might be bigger than Mona, okay?

29:18.287 --> 29:19.686
She could be working for someone.

29:19.939 --> 29:20.774
Someone like who?

29:20.775 --> 29:22.343
That's what we're trying to find out.

29:22.857 --> 29:23.983
At first we thought it was Cece,

29:23.984 --> 29:26.270
but now... now we don't know what to think.

29:27.660 --> 29:28.803
Why didn't you tell me this?

29:29.915 --> 29:31.081
'Cause I was being protective.

29:31.859 --> 29:32.957
Same as you and Caleb.

29:36.545 --> 29:37.571
Now it's your turn.

29:39.284 --> 29:40.702
Shana? Em...

29:40.703 --> 29:42.330
No, we can't be half honest. I

29:42.331 --> 29:43.797
saw the way you two looked
at each other............

29:47.376 --> 29:48.303
We dated...

29:49.479 --> 29:52.392
This summer, while you
were working in Haiti.

29:52.393 --> 29:53.191
Three weeks.

29:54.246 --> 29:55.963
If it was over, why would you lie about it?

29:55.964 --> 29:57.476
Because I didn't wanna hurt you.

29:59.186 --> 30:02.394
Emily, believe me.

30:03.528 --> 30:04.430
It's over.

30:05.794 --> 30:07.198
She was a substitute,

30:07.199 --> 30:09.993
at a time when I never thought
I'd get the real thing.

30:11.992 --> 30:13.204
I love you.

31:19.793 --> 31:21.204
Hey, Hanna. It's me.

31:21.205 --> 31:22.436
I just saw Wilden.

31:22.845 --> 31:25.960
We need to talk about what
you told me earlier, okay?

31:25.961 --> 31:27.294
Call me as soon as you get this.

31:27.604 --> 31:28.472
Love you. Bye.

32:03.968 --> 32:05.846
What'd it take to get you out of bed?

32:06.342 --> 32:10.236
I... just needed some fresh air.

32:12.043 --> 32:12.904
Spencer...

32:17.729 --> 32:19.940
I know it's none of my business,

32:19.941 --> 32:22.722
but no company is better than bad company.

32:25.508 --> 32:27.130
What's that supposed to mean?

32:29.226 --> 32:30.833
I bought Wren that cologne.

32:42.648 --> 32:44.979
Hey... don't you wanna give
that to goodwill or something?

32:45.271 --> 32:49.030
Knowing my mother, there's probably
is a tracking device on that.

32:55.761 --> 32:57.964
Does Malcolm know that you're his dad?

32:59.072 --> 33:00.040
Not yet.

33:00.523 --> 33:04.269
It's a big step, but we're trying
to ease him into the idea.

33:05.073 --> 33:07.214
Well, whatever you decide,
I'm here for you.

33:08.015 --> 33:08.763
Thank you.

33:10.903 --> 33:12.828
So if my memory serves me correct,

33:12.829 --> 33:15.430
I'm pretty sure that I won the
last movie night coin toss,

33:15.431 --> 33:17.804
which means that we are watching
anything but Chinatown.

33:17.805 --> 33:19.258
One of these nights you are going to

33:19.259 --> 33:20.902
stay awake through the entire movie.

33:21.292 --> 33:23.300
One of these nights is not tonight.

33:23.918 --> 33:24.894
I'm gonna make popcorn.

33:32.049 --> 33:32.915
Hey, what's up?

33:34.111 --> 33:37.084
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, slow down, slow down.

33:38.581 --> 33:42.520
No. No, it's okay. I got time.

33:45.215 --> 33:47.680
It's Maggie. Is everything okay?

33:48.203 --> 33:52.653
Uh, I don't know, uh, but we
will figure something out.

33:52.654 --> 33:53.364
What's wrong?

33:55.561 --> 33:58.231
My mom owns Maggie's condo,
and she's selling it.

33:58.232 --> 33:59.048
What?

33:59.049 --> 34:01.559
No, no, no, no. Look,
that's not gonna happen.

34:01.950 --> 34:03.899
Look, you got rights and nothing...

34:03.900 --> 34:05.392
nothing's gonna happen overnight.

34:37.415 --> 34:38.317
Is there a problem?

34:39.235 --> 34:40.397
Have you been drinking?

34:41.139 --> 34:42.062
What are you doing?

34:42.331 --> 34:43.849
Just answer the question.

34:43.850 --> 34:45.739
You know very well I haven't.

34:45.739 --> 34:47.577
I know you had a drink at the table.

34:48.192 --> 34:49.521
Please step out of the car.

34:50.920 --> 34:52.225
Where are you going with this?

34:52.226 --> 34:54.589
Are you refusing an order
from an officer of the law?

34:55.540 --> 34:57.127
Step out of the car please.

35:53.444 --> 35:55.071
We need to talk about Hanna.

35:56.448 --> 35:58.721
Can you keep Hanna quiet or not?

35:59.496 --> 36:01.736
If you wanna continue this
discussion, call my lawyer.

36:01.737 --> 36:03.509
I'm not the only one with secrets.

36:03.838 --> 36:05.940
You talk, I talk,

36:05.941 --> 36:07.948
and you could lose a lot
more than your boyfriend.

36:07.949 --> 36:08.894
Don't threaten me.

36:09.260 --> 36:10.688
Hey... let go of me!

36:10.689 --> 36:13.384
This is nothing compared to
what I'll do if Hanna talks.

36:13.385 --> 36:15.353
I wonder how your lieutenant will respond

36:15.354 --> 36:17.284
when he hears you're threatening a child.

36:17.285 --> 36:18.628
He's not going to.

36:19.488 --> 36:20.999
Think this through, Ashley.

36:21.473 --> 36:23.017
How do you live with yourself?

36:26.434 --> 36:27.734
Hey, we're not done here!

36:30.424 --> 36:31.408
Get out of my way!

36:31.409 --> 36:33.085
I can't let you go!

36:33.086 --> 36:34.136
Get out of my way!

36:34.137 --> 36:36.235
Either you shut Hanna up, or I will!

36:56.376 --> 36:57.109
Cece?

37:03.501 --> 37:04.453
Where are you going?

37:05.079 --> 37:06.968
Anywhere. Fast.

37:07.288 --> 37:08.365
Is this about Wilden?

37:09.159 --> 37:10.262
Ya think?

37:12.303 --> 37:14.725
Emily, I thought you could keep a secret.

37:14.726 --> 37:16.970
Is there anyone in this
town that you didn't tell?

37:16.971 --> 37:19.855
I saw a picture of you, Wilden,
and Ali on a sailboat.

37:19.856 --> 37:20.912
Yeah, she thought he was cute,

37:20.913 --> 37:22.800
so she asked him if he'd
take us for a ride.

37:22.801 --> 37:25.908
Then why lie about it? I don't
have time to talk about this!

37:25.909 --> 37:27.962
You're not the only one
that's scared, okay?

37:27.963 --> 37:29.827
Please. If there's something
I need to know...

37:33.454 --> 37:34.998
I thought Wilden got Ali pregnant

37:34.999 --> 37:37.567
and killed her to keep it a secret.

37:37.927 --> 37:38.925
So is it true?

37:39.804 --> 37:40.655
I don't know what's true.

37:40.656 --> 37:42.462
Wilden's sure going out
of his way to deny it,

37:42.463 --> 37:45.275
and if there's one thing Ali could do,

37:45.539 --> 37:46.900
it's tell a good lie.

37:47.215 --> 37:49.286
If you thought he killed
her, why not turn him in?

37:49.287 --> 37:52.576
Oh, to who? One of his pals on the force?

37:53.008 --> 37:54.510
I didn't know who I could trust.

37:56.121 --> 37:58.098
Jason said he saw you at his house

37:58.099 --> 37:59.609
the night Ali disappeared.

38:00.555 --> 38:01.599
He told you that?

38:02.374 --> 38:04.289
God, this is so messed up.

38:05.115 --> 38:06.145
Why were you there?

38:07.644 --> 38:09.050
Ali called.

38:09.051 --> 38:11.587
She was freaking out about some videos.

38:11.588 --> 38:13.087
Everyone wanted them.

38:13.088 --> 38:15.876
Spencer's big sister more than anyone.

38:15.877 --> 38:18.560
When I showed up, she
begged me to talk to Ali.

38:18.561 --> 38:21.791
So I did. Then Ali left to go get them.

38:22.126 --> 38:25.151
Next day... she was missing.

38:31.690 --> 38:32.937
Who took that picture?

38:34.611 --> 38:36.307
You three on the sailboat. Who took it?

38:38.918 --> 38:40.352
Melissa Hastings.

39:09.028 --> 39:10.075
Melissa!

39:22.512 --> 39:23.602
Melissa!

39:24.796 --> 39:25.793
Melissa!

39:29.356 --> 39:31.443
Help! Melissa!

39:31.622 --> 39:33.235
Somebody, please!

39:33.236 --> 39:35.221
Melissa! Can you hear me?!

39:35.907 --> 39:37.583
Melissa, please!

39:45.755 --> 39:46.878
Melissa!

39:49.453 --> 39:50.677
Please!

39:54.568 --> 39:55.858
Melissa!

39:59.779 --> 40:01.271
Somebody, please!

40:08.141 --> 40:09.114
What happened?

40:09.690 --> 40:10.633
What happened?

40:20.746 --> 40:23.460
God, mom! You almost
gave me a heart attack!

40:34.466 --> 40:35.554
Mom, what's wrong?

40:41.604 --> 40:43.614
I think I might have
killed Detective Wilden.

40:56.961 --> 40:57.661
Hey.

41:01.079 --> 41:02.414
I'm gonna stay with you tonight.

41:03.587 --> 41:05.234
Thank God I got your text.

41:10.149 --> 41:11.416
This was revenge.

41:12.379 --> 41:13.678
For what happened with Mona?

41:15.573 --> 41:17.044
For hooking up with Wren.

41:19.884 --> 41:21.290
You...? It's a long story.

41:24.579 --> 41:26.935
Why would Mona care about you and Wren?

41:34.875 --> 41:36.927
Can you call Hanna and Emily?

41:37.655 --> 41:39.137
I need them to come over.

41:39.138 --> 41:40.933
Sure. Why?

41:44.477 --> 41:45.870
I know who's helping Mona.

42:02.670 --> 42:03.390
There.

42:10.452 --> 42:11.947
I don't want you seeing this.

42:12.632 --> 42:14.516
Look, I'm not letting you do this alone.

42:46.251 --> 42:50.047
Mom... where's Wilden?

42:54.918 --> 42:56.220
I don't know.
