13:06.720 --> 13:08.052
Run, run, run, run!

13:31.311 --> 13:32.911
Archie, get me out of here, man.

13:32.913 --> 13:36.314
What happened to all
that big, dumb big-dick shit?

13:37.417 --> 13:38.983
Fuck!

13:38.985 --> 13:40.285
[hissing]

13:40.287 --> 13:42.187
-Ah, shit!
-[Little Dig] Archie! What?

13:42.189 --> 13:44.589
Oh, shit! We gotta get
the fuck out of here.

13:44.591 --> 13:46.090
-Follow me! Follow me!
-[Little Dig] Please, wait.

13:46.092 --> 13:47.792
-[Jack] Get outta here!
-Archie, I'm scared!

13:47.794 --> 13:48.893
Archie!

14:20.026 --> 14:22.160
You look like you're tired,
you fucking jerk-off!

14:22.162 --> 14:23.862
Okay, now, huh?

14:25.732 --> 14:28.132
You are a pink taco
in a firefight.

14:28.134 --> 14:30.501
[groaning]

14:30.503 --> 14:31.970
What about
the distribution deal?

14:31.972 --> 14:33.838
Dude,
fuck those ass-clowns, man.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.673
I wasn't even gonna come
for their baby shit

14:35.675 --> 14:37.742
until you mentioned
the gift cards.

14:37.744 --> 14:40.211
Now that shit's
pure fucking genius, <i> boet.</i>

14:40.213 --> 14:42.914
Those Mexicans
aren't to be fucked with, man.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.250
Like I said, fuck 'em.

14:45.252 --> 14:46.918
This is Africa, not Tijuana.

14:46.920 --> 14:49.520
You don't get it.
Doesn't matter where you are.

14:49.522 --> 14:50.889
They're the Mexican cartel.

14:50.891 --> 14:52.423
They will find you.

14:52.425 --> 14:55.093
You started a war,
and guess who's gonna die first.

14:55.095 --> 14:56.494
Archie Moses.

14:57.898 --> 15:00.431
Well, then you're just gonna
have to beg for mercy, china.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.603
Hey, chum, relax.

15:06.673 --> 15:07.972
I'm gonna take care of you.

15:09.442 --> 15:11.442
Let's go have a beer. Come on.

15:16.116 --> 15:17.782
When you're dumb, you bleed.

15:28.228 --> 15:32.196
[man]
<i>You suffered a gunshot wound</i>
<i>to the head some years back.</i>

15:34.768 --> 15:37.902
This bullet in your brain
is like a time bomb.

15:37.904 --> 15:42.006
Ordinarily,
I would like to go in there
and dig the little bugger out,

15:42.742 --> 15:44.108
but given the position it's in,

15:44.110 --> 15:46.411
I'm afraid we might do more harm
than good.

15:46.413 --> 15:47.946
Yeah. We don't wanna
do more harm than good.

15:47.948 --> 15:49.948
-We don't wanna do that.
-No.

15:49.950 --> 15:52.984
Of course there is a chance
it could move on its own.

15:52.986 --> 15:56.254
Another bang to the head might
shift it in the other direction.

15:56.256 --> 15:57.922
So basically what I'm saying is,

15:57.924 --> 16:00.158
this bullet in your brain
could prove fatal.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.060
However, don't worry.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.395
There is a way for us
to keep you chugging along.

16:04.397 --> 16:08.833
Just stay in bed
and don't engage in any
physical activity whatsoever.

16:08.835 --> 16:10.468
Look, I don't know
what's going on with me, Doc.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.303
A couple months back,
I was on a stakeout

16:12.305 --> 16:15.306
and I dropped my gun
and my gun shot somebody.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.709
I mean,
it's like my shit's sliding.

16:19.679 --> 16:22.647
-Your shit?
-Yeah, I don't feel the same.
I ain't the same nigga.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.983
Oh! Well, that makes sense,

16:24.985 --> 16:27.151
because the position
that the fragment is in,

16:27.153 --> 16:30.188
that would affect
your equilibrium
and your motor skills.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.656
What about sex?

16:31.658 --> 16:35.426
I mean, all I think about
is tacos and pussy.

16:35.428 --> 16:38.329
No. No. No pussy. No tacos.

16:38.331 --> 16:39.931
-No pussy?
-No pussy.

16:39.933 --> 16:41.599
-No tacos?
-No tacos.

16:41.601 --> 16:44.535
Cold showers.
That's the best medicine.

16:44.537 --> 16:47.438
Listen,
they got enough gift cards
to ship 625 million.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.640
If they can move
their own money,
why would they stay?

16:49.642 --> 16:52.443
Spyder's been talking
about this island
they bought in Australia.

16:52.445 --> 16:54.812
I don't think you're gonna stick
around if you're gonna shoot
all those people.

16:54.814 --> 16:58.316
No. We are not gonna continue
this shit show.

16:58.318 --> 17:01.786
It's like the sick
fucking the dead with you!

17:01.788 --> 17:06.023
Eight guys being mowed down
in broad daylight is a disaster.

17:06.026 --> 17:08.693
Don't burn this case, man.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.028
Let me finish it.

17:10.030 --> 17:12.195
All right, fine.

17:12.198 --> 17:15.665
You nail this guy
and make us look good.

17:15.667 --> 17:17.635
But you better
watch your ass, Carter,

17:17.637 --> 17:21.472
because if you fuck this up,
I'm gonna pull your badge!

17:21.473 --> 17:23.508
-You got it?
-I got it.

17:23.510 --> 17:27.310
Now you need to worry about the
rest of the real cartel killers.

17:27.313 --> 17:28.679
I'll be fine.

17:28.681 --> 17:31.249
Not you. Archie Moses.

17:31.251 --> 17:33.818
As far as the Mexicans
are concerned,

17:33.820 --> 17:36.421
it was Archie Moses
who set them up.

17:36.423 --> 17:39.557
-Where the fuck is he?
<i> -PinMe your location.</i>

17:39.559 --> 17:43.461
And I'll have one of
our operatives come pick you up
and deliver you to him.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.079
There it is.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.248
He's been working
as a janitor here
the last six months.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.184
[Jack] "Pinkies Blue Room."

18:06.186 --> 18:08.419
Look, if you want, I can stay.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.421
Nah. I can handle this.

18:10.423 --> 18:11.789
Sure about that?

18:12.759 --> 18:15.793
Last meet went sideways.
Lot of guys died.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.429
Nah, I got this.

18:19.199 --> 18:20.498
This is personal.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.101
Thanks for the lift, though.

18:23.103 --> 18:25.002
Schmidts are a big get.

18:25.872 --> 18:26.938
Finish strong.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.573
Pinkies, huh?

18:28.575 --> 18:30.308
I'm in and out.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.543

Don't forget to tip

19:24.164 --> 19:25.363

What can I get you, teddy bear?

19:39.946 --> 19:41.879
I'm looking for a friend.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.314
White guy. Tall.

19:43.316 --> 19:45.683
Is he tall but seems small?

19:45.685 --> 19:47.652
-Like a total wussy?
-You mean a pussy?

19:47.654 --> 19:50.354
Uh-uh. Pussies are strong.

19:51.991 --> 19:54.292
Sounds like him. Archie Moses.

19:54.294 --> 19:56.627
Ah! Follow me.

19:59.199 --> 20:01.699
He works gravy mop-up for me.

20:01.701 --> 20:05.536
-Oh, you have a kitchen here?
-[laughs] You're cute.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.307
Oh. Gravy. I get it.

20:09.309 --> 20:11.475
You're quick. Are you a cop?

20:11.477 --> 20:13.811
Are you a criminal?
Sometimes.

20:13.813 --> 20:15.613
[chuckles] I'm a friend.

20:16.716 --> 20:17.882
You a homeowner?

20:19.085 --> 20:20.451
No, I rent. I live in LA.

20:21.988 --> 20:23.054
No, you fucking idiot.

20:23.056 --> 20:24.922
I mean LGBTQ,

20:24.924 --> 20:28.192
'cause, if you are, the men's
bathhouse is down the road.

20:28.194 --> 20:30.027
It's called the Red Blossom.

20:30.029 --> 20:34.198
You think I'm L-G-bar... B...
What is the Q for?

20:34.200 --> 20:36.534
Questioning your sexuality.

20:36.536 --> 20:39.604
The last person who questioned
my sexuality was Alicia Johnson.

20:39.606 --> 20:41.272
-You know what she got?
-What?

20:41.274 --> 20:43.174
-NBD.
-What's that stand for?

20:43.176 --> 20:47.378
Boom, bop, bam, boom shaka-laka.

20:47.380 --> 20:48.846
"Nothing But Dick."

20:50.550 --> 20:51.649
Now, where's Archie?

20:52.252 --> 20:53.818
I think I like you.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.953
-Follow me.
-Hmm...

20:57.390 --> 20:59.890
[MC] Wowza. We're just
getting started up here

20:59.892 --> 21:01.926
with our all-star lineup
of Cape Town beauties...

21:01.928 --> 21:03.094
There he is.

21:04.197 --> 21:06.364
Let me know if you
need anything, teddy bear.

21:06.366 --> 21:09.634
[MC] Make sure to check out
Zin in the birdcage
on the upper deck.

21:09.636 --> 21:11.769
And remember, guys,
don't be a schmuck.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.204
Show her that buck.

21:13.206 --> 21:15.473
Slip it in her G-string.
Put it down her top.

21:15.475 --> 21:16.974
Hey, big boy.

21:22.548 --> 21:24.215
Blind man walks into a bar...

21:27.487 --> 21:29.320
What the fuck is this?

21:29.322 --> 21:31.555
Fucking Jack Carter, bitch.

21:31.557 --> 21:33.724
I've got nothing to say to you.

21:33.726 --> 21:36.227
This is not exactly easy
for me either.

21:36.229 --> 21:39.397
Last time I saw you
was through a prison fence.

21:39.399 --> 21:41.732
I spent the next year
with a <i> Sports Illustrated</i>

21:41.734 --> 21:43.734
stuffed down the back
of my pants.

21:43.736 --> 21:46.304
Guys afraid to get paper cuts
on their dick.

21:46.306 --> 21:49.440
Last time I saw you,
you put a bullet
in my fucking head.

21:49.442 --> 21:51.475
You still whining
about that shit?

21:51.477 --> 21:53.244
Let it go, man, you big baby.

21:53.246 --> 21:56.480
I let you run.
All you had to do
was keep running.

21:56.482 --> 21:58.949
All you had to do
was keep fucking running.

21:58.951 --> 22:01.485
And you brought
your narrow ass back.

22:01.487 --> 22:04.088
I only came back
for my mother's funeral.

22:05.191 --> 22:07.258
-How is she?
-She's still fucking dead, man!

22:07.260 --> 22:08.926
-Right. Right.
-That's the problem with you.

22:08.928 --> 22:11.595
You're a selfish prick.
You never listen to me.

22:11.597 --> 22:13.264
Everything was always about you.

22:13.266 --> 22:17.635
Hear me now.
You fucked my ass up bad.

22:17.637 --> 22:19.937
-I fucked your ass?
-You fucked my ass.

22:19.939 --> 22:22.106
-I fucked your ass?
-No lube, man.

22:22.508 --> 22:23.974
Not gay, huh?

22:23.976 --> 22:26.143
Listen, missy.
This is some men shit.

22:26.145 --> 22:28.145
You listen.

22:28.147 --> 22:31.449
You know how fucked up
it was getting thrown
against my mom's casket

22:31.451 --> 22:32.883
and cuffed right there?

22:32.885 --> 22:35.486
That was the real
balls-across-the-nose play.

22:35.488 --> 22:38.456
Real bullshit, man.
Petty. Petty!

22:38.458 --> 22:41.225
To be honest with you,
prison did you good.

22:41.227 --> 22:43.794
You're looking good.
Your complexion is beautiful.

22:43.796 --> 22:46.997
I've always looked good.
I've always had
a good complexion.

22:46.999 --> 22:49.834
But I'm working gravy mop-up.
Is that a good job?

22:49.836 --> 22:51.869
I'm cleaning up
dick spills, man.

22:51.871 --> 22:54.071
I'm supposed to be making
dick spills.

22:54.073 --> 22:55.673
I'm a make-dick-spill guy.

22:55.675 --> 22:57.241
That's my specialty.

22:57.243 --> 22:59.577
I got a strong, loud load.

22:59.579 --> 23:01.812
-It's an honest job.
-Honest job?

23:01.814 --> 23:03.581
I got one kneepad.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.549
The other got eaten by cum.

23:05.551 --> 23:07.385
You know what
you're supposed to do in life?

23:07.387 --> 23:10.388
Meet a woman, nut on her tits.

23:11.023 --> 23:12.723
That's life.

23:12.725 --> 23:15.359
Not meet a girl,
nut in your pants,

23:15.361 --> 23:17.828
rub it on a couch,
call for Archie?

23:17.830 --> 23:20.097
Well, actually I came here
to warn you.

23:21.234 --> 23:24.168
There's a Mexican hit team
on their way to kill you.

23:25.938 --> 23:27.271
Care to explain that?

23:52.865 --> 23:55.099
Well, I left LAPD
and became DEA.

23:55.101 --> 23:57.301
I been working this case
in South Africa.

23:57.303 --> 24:00.104
This drug lord is trying
to move his money
through gift cards.

24:00.106 --> 24:03.741
Jesus Christ. Will there be
a point to this story ever
that involves me?

24:03.743 --> 24:06.210
Well, this is the funny part.

24:07.780 --> 24:11.449
I was undercover
as Archie Moses.

24:13.085 --> 24:14.185
Excuse me?

24:21.060 --> 24:23.828
So, you told a drug cartel
you were Archie Moses.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.729
Then a bunch of them got whacked

24:25.731 --> 24:27.598
and now I'm at the top
of their to-do list?

24:27.600 --> 24:29.900
-Is that the gist of it?
-More or less.

24:29.902 --> 24:33.637
So when I have a machete
just shoved up my ass,

24:33.639 --> 24:35.406
can I just more or less say,

24:35.408 --> 24:37.374
"Hey, man,
sorry I killed your friends"?

24:38.277 --> 24:40.177
I gotta get you
out of here, man.

24:40.179 --> 24:44.315
I traveled halfway
across the planet,
the other side of the world,

24:44.317 --> 24:46.984
to kind of get away from you,
to get a fresh start.

24:46.986 --> 24:48.819
And I was feeling
real good about it.

24:48.821 --> 24:51.922
And somehow you figured out
a way to fuck me again.

24:53.125 --> 24:56.160
As long as my cover's not blown,
I can take care of you.

25:02.034 --> 25:04.101
You got me balls-deep here, man.

25:04.103 --> 25:07.638
And here I thought I'd have to
maybe pass out at a frat party

25:07.640 --> 25:08.973
to get fucked up the ass.

25:08.975 --> 25:11.041
Nobody wanna hear
your fucking bitching.

25:11.043 --> 25:13.010
Life's a bitch! Okay?

25:13.012 --> 25:16.180
I'm dealing with
this fucking bullet
dancing in my head,

25:16.182 --> 25:19.216
the doctor telling me
that I'm eating my feelings.

25:19.218 --> 25:20.985
I like tacos and puppies.

25:20.987 --> 25:24.154
I don't have a broad
to love and cherish.

25:24.156 --> 25:26.123
I jack off nine times a day.

25:26.125 --> 25:27.725
I wanna fuck everything I see.

25:27.727 --> 25:29.393
You're just describing
being a man.

25:29.395 --> 25:30.895
I'm watching black porn.

25:30.897 --> 25:32.630
-Have you watched black porn?
-I have.

25:32.632 --> 25:34.398
They fuck with their socks on!

25:34.400 --> 25:37.635
I know! It freaks me out too!
It's no big deal. I got over it.

25:37.637 --> 25:39.370
But guess what. You're black!

25:39.372 --> 25:41.572
Watch it! Be who you are.

25:41.574 --> 25:45.342
But the bottom line is,
I'm gonna play the tiniest
violin in the world for you

25:45.344 --> 25:47.144
when they're blow-torching
my nuts off.

26:03.763 --> 26:04.995
Hey, <i> puto!</i>

26:04.997 --> 26:06.430
Oh, shit.

[The Math Club's

26:35.528 --> 26:36.627
Give me a bottle.

26:36.629 --> 26:38.195
Fuck! Give me a bottle!

26:45.972 --> 26:47.805
For what it's worth,
you're my favorite.

26:47.807 --> 26:48.939
I love your tits.

What's your name, anyway?

29:16.455 --> 29:18.589
You speak English?
I don't give a shit.

29:18.591 --> 29:20.724
With tits like that,
you don't even need to talk.

a slow Tuesday night, huh?
Come on, then. Follow me.

Looks like you two knob jockeys
need a place to crash.

29:27.233 --> 29:29.233

for a full shift, Pink.

29:29.235 --> 29:31.268
-Suck my dick.
-I will.

How you been?"

No, I don't, but it sounds like
you're both in the wrong, to me.

Half full, you saved my life.

31:05.064 --> 31:07.497
Half empty,
it was your fault to begin with.

31:07.499 --> 31:09.733
-You're an asshole.
-Mm-hmm.

31:09.735 --> 31:11.902
You come here,
you fuck up my life.

31:12.805 --> 31:14.438

with the dick.

Fucking Carter.

31:36.428 --> 31:38.729
Did somebody kill
a fucking bird in here?

31:42.434 --> 31:45.435
None of this shit would be
happening if Spyder didn't
go up against the cartel.

31:45.437 --> 31:47.905
He's the nice one compared
to the rest of that family.

31:47.907 --> 31:49.773
-Your point?
-You haven't met the family?

31:49.775 --> 31:51.375
I'll meet the family.

31:51.377 --> 31:53.343
-You've only met Spyder?
-Yeah. So what?

31:53.345 --> 31:55.746
He's a pussycat
compared to the rest.

You can't handle that family.
They're gonna sniff you out.

They'll kill you, and then
they're coming after me.

You'll be in a fucking
safe house, okay? So relax.

32:03.589 --> 32:05.555
I'm not gonna be
in a safe house.

32:05.557 --> 32:08.358
First of all,
a safe house is never safe.
And it's never a house.

just die there.

out of your ass and butch up?

Oh, my God.

-Focus, Carter.
-Move!

-You move!

what the fuck we do.

32:42.728 --> 32:46.129

I've been doing that
my whole life.

Sometimes I'm a combat reporter.
All right?

32:50.602 --> 32:52.602

32:52.604 --> 32:55.839
I don't even know
what I just said, all right?
That's how good I am.

32:55.841 --> 32:59.443
And besides, you said
the syndicate's all about
those bootleg gift cards.

32:59.445 --> 33:01.445

Do you know anything about that?

33:01.447 --> 33:03.280
-Do you know anything about it?
-Yeah, I do.

33:04.917 --> 33:06.516
-Can you configure that?
-Can you?

33:06.518 --> 33:07.951
-Yes, I can!
-[Jack] Then I can do it!

33:07.953 --> 33:09.453
-No, you cannot.
-Are you fucking kidding me?

33:09.455 --> 33:11.154
No. And then when you
fuck up in front of them,

33:11.156 --> 33:12.823
pop-pop, each eye.

33:12.825 --> 33:15.659
You know what they call that?

33:15.661 --> 33:20.330
He's right. This is Cape Town
where the air is clean

33:20.332 --> 33:22.165
and the sex is dirty.

33:22.167 --> 33:24.001
Just like the cops, huh?

33:25.938 --> 33:27.971
I'll just have
the cops back me up.

if I wanna stay alive.

is back!

33:34.380 --> 33:36.246

33:57.669 --> 34:00.737
Make sure you take down
that little bitch Spyder, yeah?

34:00.739 --> 34:05.642
And you... know where to find me
if you need me.

34:07.346 --> 34:09.813
I told her,
I'm not freezing my sperm.

34:09.815 --> 34:12.748
If you want it, you can take it
the way God intended,

34:12.751 --> 34:14.818

right on your tits.

34:16.188 --> 34:18.155
I got a question for you.

34:18.157 --> 34:20.424
Did you ever see
that shitty movie
they made about us?

34:22.161 --> 34:23.360
Of course I seen it.

34:23.362 --> 34:24.795
They made me Jewish.

34:26.165 --> 34:29.331
I mean,
I got no beef with the Jews,
but what the fuck?

34:29.333 --> 34:32.002
Look how tall I am.
I'm the opposite of Jewish.

34:32.004 --> 34:33.503
Mustache-strong.

34:33.505 --> 34:35.705
They should've got someone
like Daniel Day-Lewis,

34:35.706 --> 34:38.574
maybe Tom Selleck, just someone
that's got a strong 'stache.

34:38.577 --> 34:39.943
They made me a Wayans.

34:39.945 --> 34:42.245
Yeah, but that's handsome.
You scored.

34:42.246 --> 34:43.713
The Wayans are all gorgeous

34:43.715 --> 34:45.715
and they got the abs
like they been to prison.

He doesn't have an ab.

last night?

34:53.725 --> 34:55.225

on a nigga like that.

34:55.226 --> 34:57.861
-What happened?
-People got shot, bad guys died.

34:57.863 --> 34:59.396
What do you want me to tell you?

34:59.398 --> 35:01.765
I spent the whole morning
cleaning up after you.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.967
Everywhere you go,
dead bodies pile up.

35:03.969 --> 35:06.303
What's wrong with you?

35:06.305 --> 35:09.406
By the way, I'd like to
introduce you to Archie Moses.
He'll be running game with us.

35:09.408 --> 35:11.875
How are you? Archie Moses.
Good to see you.
Nice to meet you.

35:11.877 --> 35:13.610
I said you need
to break this fast.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.979
Word is they're on the move,
and once they're up in the air--

35:15.981 --> 35:17.814
Poof! Game over. You got that?

35:17.816 --> 35:21.384
If I can ask,
what exactly are we looking for?

35:21.386 --> 35:23.153
And don't say a flash drive.

35:23.155 --> 35:25.122
I'm so sick of looking
for fucking flash drives.

35:25.124 --> 35:26.823
Please don't say flash drive!

35:26.825 --> 35:29.726
I don't know whether
it's on a flash drive,
a hard drive

35:29.728 --> 35:32.762
-or a motherfucking
four-wheel drive.
-Four-wheel drive we could find.

35:32.764 --> 35:35.098
I mean, they're big,
you just go to where
they're parked.

35:35.100 --> 35:36.600
You get in it,
you drive it where it needs.

35:36.602 --> 35:39.436
-Yeah.
-What you're looking for
is a code.

35:39.438 --> 35:40.504
C-O-D-E.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.506
Aw, man, that's another...

35:42.508 --> 35:45.075
-That's code for flash drive.
-Codes are worse.

35:45.077 --> 35:47.110
It's a code that deciphers
their ledgers.

35:47.112 --> 35:48.678
That could fit on a...

35:48.680 --> 35:50.313
Don't fuck it up, Carter.

36:02.494 --> 36:03.827
That's a good-looking boat.

36:17.609 --> 36:19.543
[Jack] I got this guy
wired in pretty tight.

36:19.545 --> 36:22.546
I told him
I was bringing in my junior
just to watch my back, okay?

36:22.548 --> 36:24.881
Why can't we be equals?

the better.

-[Spyder] How's it, my china?
-Hey.

36:31.823 --> 36:33.523
Can't touch this, huh?

36:34.493 --> 36:36.193
Is this the guy
you've been talking about?

36:36.195 --> 36:38.562
Yeah. Let me introduce you to--

36:38.564 --> 36:39.996
-Nick Sweater.
-[Spyder] Yeah.

36:39.998 --> 36:42.732
They call me Sweat,
because I don't.

36:42.734 --> 36:47.671
Nice. So, is this the first time
you're in South Africa? Sweet.

36:47.673 --> 36:49.072
-[Archie] The Rainbow Nation?
-Yeah.

36:49.074 --> 36:51.374
No, I know a little bit
about a little bit.

36:51.376 --> 36:54.344
I whacked some fucker out
in Jo-burg a while back, so...

36:54.346 --> 36:56.346
So, what brings you back
to our sunny shores?

36:56.348 --> 36:59.583
Well, Archie called
and asked me to lend him a hand.

37:00.852 --> 37:02.085
You better tell me the truth.

37:04.089 --> 37:05.922
Has he always been
such a pussy in a fight?

37:07.025 --> 37:09.259
Well, Archie's
not really the muscle.

37:09.261 --> 37:10.927
He kind of brings me in
for the hot stuff.

37:10.929 --> 37:12.896
That's... That's
what I'm here for.

37:12.898 --> 37:15.031
Thank God for that, <i> boet.</i>
'Cause, I mean,

37:15.033 --> 37:17.567
he plays a good game,
he really sells it well,

37:17.569 --> 37:19.936
but then when the shit
hits the fan, I mean...

37:19.938 --> 37:22.706
I'm out there,
popping myself some Mexicans,

37:22.708 --> 37:25.108
boom-boom-boom,
I come around the corner,

37:25.110 --> 37:29.913
and there he is
basically crying in a puddle
of his own piss, man.

37:29.915 --> 37:33.416
Well, you know me. I can't
fight my way out of a cloud.

37:36.521 --> 37:38.021
You know, the...

37:38.023 --> 37:41.725
It's a funny thing.
I can't put my finger on it.

37:41.727 --> 37:46.363
But I just don't get...
What's your relationship?

37:50.402 --> 37:54.304
Archie's my errand boy.
He does what I say
or he gets a little pimp slap.

37:55.240 --> 37:57.641
-Isn't that right, Archie?
-Sure.

37:57.643 --> 38:00.877
I mean, he's cute.
I mean, he's got that physique.

38:00.879 --> 38:02.445
He's built like
a brick shithouse.

38:02.447 --> 38:05.315
But come crunch time,
when that action hits,

38:05.317 --> 38:07.450
-bam, he's gone.
-Yeah, yeah.

38:07.452 --> 38:10.220
He's about as useful
as a broke dick
on a wedding night.

38:10.222 --> 38:12.455
-Back home,
we call him Jelly Dick.
-Not a fuck.

38:12.457 --> 38:13.990
Sponge Dick, Noodle Dick.

38:13.992 --> 38:16.960
[Spyder] Noodle Dick! [laughs]

38:16.962 --> 38:19.829
Anything soft in front
of the word "dick"
applies to him.

38:19.831 --> 38:21.264
Cream dick!

38:21.266 --> 38:22.999
Cream dick is good,
but it's a little hard.

38:23.001 --> 38:24.334
-'Cause cream can get hard.
-Yeah.

My favorite? Air dick.

38:25.570 --> 38:26.936
Hey, air dick!

38:26.938 --> 38:28.305
It's like it's not even there.

38:28.307 --> 38:29.906
It's like,
"Where's the dick? Is that air?"

38:29.908 --> 38:32.409
-Where the fuck is my dick?
-Was there a dick here?

38:33.612 --> 38:35.578
Feels like air.
I'm getting oxygen,

38:35.580 --> 38:37.580
but I'm not getting off
because there's no dick here.

38:37.582 --> 38:39.716
Fuck, man!
I like you already, <i> boet!</i>

38:41.119 --> 38:43.119
Yeah, Sweat, hey,
you like boats?

38:43.121 --> 38:45.288
I do, as long as they go fast.

38:45.290 --> 38:46.690
Yeah? Nice. Nice.

38:46.692 --> 38:48.458
Well, then you're gonna love
my fucking boat!

38:48.460 --> 38:51.594
Huh? You're gonna love my boat
and you're gonna love my boat.

38:51.596 --> 38:53.163
Let's go check out my boat,

How's it--

40:34.232 --> 40:36.566
These are my mates,

40:36.568 --> 40:38.935
You know,
I already spoke about Archie.

40:38.937 --> 40:42.272
But this is
the big boss man, Sweat!

40:42.274 --> 40:45.475
Man, Spyder,
you didn't tell me you had
three smoking hot sisters.

40:45.477 --> 40:47.577
I mean, I can't even tell
which one's the oldest.

40:47.579 --> 40:50.380
They are practically identical.

40:50.382 --> 40:53.583
-Are you a kiss-ass, bitch?
-Yes. I mean,
it depends on the ass.

40:53.585 --> 40:56.152
But, you know, I was just saying
you guys all look alike.

40:56.154 --> 40:57.420
[Gertie] Oh, do we now?

40:57.422 --> 40:59.656
Is that so?

40:59.658 --> 41:01.658
Let me tell you something,
buddy.

41:01.660 --> 41:03.660
My sister Jo
is a proud colored woman.

41:03.662 --> 41:05.829

-[Pernilla] Okay, that's enough!

Well, welcome.
Welcome to our little wine farm.

We're gonna get cleaned up
and we'll join you directly.

I still say triplets.
It's unbelievable.

41:22.747 --> 41:23.813
You should go with them.

41:23.815 --> 41:24.914
Oh.

Two new friends from nowhere.

41:32.624 --> 41:34.023
They're American.

41:34.759 --> 41:36.259
So, what does that prove?

41:36.261 --> 41:38.094
They could be on loan
from the narcotics bureau.

41:38.096 --> 41:41.464
Well, why aren't the ones
we're paying telling us?

41:41.466 --> 41:44.534
Oh, please, smarten up, Jo.

I called your goddamn name.

All the boys like Joanna.

43:12.857 --> 43:14.490
She's a real fuck-bunny.

Clearly, she's taken a page
out of my book.

-And tacos.

about fucking.

but this is the seven.

Yeah, that fucking asshole.

on our fucking payroll.

-Wanna fuck him up for me?

50:14.379 --> 50:16.212
-Huh?
-You wanna fuck him up for me?

50:17.682 --> 50:18.948
Yeah!

That was the problem
with the seven.

-Look at what she's got.
-Oh, a seven.

50:26.524 --> 50:28.457
Yeah. I told her I was a six.

50:28.459 --> 50:30.159
It's the seven, which is shit!

50:30.161 --> 50:33.029
-And I told her I was a six guy.
-Yeah.

50:33.031 --> 50:35.031
-And she wants me to...
-The predecessor.

50:35.033 --> 50:36.632
-[Archie] Six is my jam.
-[Jack] Yeah!

50:36.634 --> 50:38.467
Okay, let's stop fucking around.

50:38.469 --> 50:40.803
-You're gonna do this
with the seven?
-Yes.

50:40.805 --> 50:42.038
Thank you.

50:42.040 --> 50:43.406
-Come.
-Good luck.

50:48.579 --> 50:51.313
Seven is a bad idea.
I'll say it.

50:51.315 --> 50:52.681
I won't stop saying it.

50:52.683 --> 50:55.217
Right. You're gonna aim
for that window.

50:55.219 --> 50:58.120
-Which one?
-Top floor, upper right.

50:58.589 --> 51:00.756
The left?

51:00.758 --> 51:04.393
-Upper right.
That's where the fucker lives.
-I'm not paying for the window.

51:04.395 --> 51:07.396
See how low this is?
That's the seven.
It's a shit weapon.

51:07.398 --> 51:09.432
[Gertie]
You have a problem killing cops?

51:09.434 --> 51:12.902
[Archie] I give zero fucks
about killing cops.

51:12.904 --> 51:15.771
I mean, cops,
they're just tough to kill.

51:15.773 --> 51:19.275
I shot one in the head
a few years ago.
He still gives me shit nonstop.

51:19.277 --> 51:22.211
Shut up. You're gonna
fucking aim for that window.

51:22.213 --> 51:24.213
I'm dyslexic.
Where are you pointing?

51:24.215 --> 51:26.749
The fucking top right window!

51:26.751 --> 51:28.417
Jesus Christ!

51:28.419 --> 51:32.054
You know, to be honest with you,
RPG is gangbanger style.

51:32.056 --> 51:34.090
-[Archie] True.
-[Jack] You wanna make
a statement?

51:34.092 --> 51:37.359
Go in there
face-to-face with a knife.
Now, that's a bad motherfucker.

51:37.361 --> 51:38.861
This is kindergarten shit.

51:38.863 --> 51:40.863
I mean, knife...
knife is my jam.

51:40.865 --> 51:42.631
I'm a knife guy, a six guy.

51:42.633 --> 51:45.468
That's my sandwich.
I get in there.
My dad was a butcher.

51:45.470 --> 51:47.803
So if I go in there
with a knife,
I'm gonna cut him up.

51:47.805 --> 51:50.940
I'm gonna put him on a bun
and just lick it.

51:50.942 --> 51:54.043
Now it's hooked wrong.
And now I'm stretching
my leg and I--

51:54.045 --> 51:55.744
Shoot the fucking rocket, Sweat,

51:55.746 --> 51:57.646
or I'll blow your balls
out of your asshole.

51:57.648 --> 52:00.116
-Do you hear me?
-Yeah, you're in my ear.

52:00.118 --> 52:02.118
-You fucking hear me?
-Yeah.

52:02.820 --> 52:06.055
So, I'm gonna do this.

52:06.057 --> 52:08.224
-Do you see
how my leg is stretched?
-Fucking shoot it!

52:08.226 --> 52:09.458
Shoot the fucking
goddamned thing.

52:09.460 --> 52:10.659
-[Archie] Are you sure?
-Shoot it!

52:10.661 --> 52:11.961
Fuck it.

52:15.733 --> 52:16.899
What the fuck!

52:16.901 --> 52:18.067
Nice work, Sweat.

52:19.337 --> 52:20.669
I'm a seven guy.

52:20.671 --> 52:22.905
I am a fucking seven guy!

52:22.907 --> 52:25.307
-Did you see the seven?
-[Jo] Let's get the fuck
out of here!

52:25.309 --> 52:27.042
-Seven works.
-The six is shit!

52:28.446 --> 52:29.812
I love the seven.

52:29.814 --> 52:32.014
[tires squealing]

52:37.755 --> 52:38.921
Fucking Carter!

52:56.040 --> 52:59.175
[laughs]
Did you know I was a seven guy?

52:59.177 --> 53:00.509
[Gertie] Wait up, Sweat.

53:02.013 --> 53:04.547
Welcome back, miss.
How was your little foray?

53:04.549 --> 53:06.415
Checkered flags all around.

53:08.352 --> 53:13.222
[acoustic guitar playing]

53:40.685 --> 53:45.254
[woman singing ballad
in Spanish]

53:50.094 --> 53:51.427
Goddamn!

54:03.708 --> 54:04.807
Hey, Daddy.

54:05.443 --> 54:06.976
Hey, Jo.

54:10.014 --> 54:12.448
Jo, I can't do this.

54:12.450 --> 54:14.984
-I can't do this.
-You don't have to do anything.

54:15.853 --> 54:17.920
I'll do all the work.

54:17.922 --> 54:19.822
Okay, you just sit back...

54:20.791 --> 54:24.360
and let me be the monster fuck
of your life.

54:26.130 --> 54:28.097
That's what your mother said.

54:29.734 --> 54:31.467
She knows me very well.

54:31.469 --> 54:35.604
[woman continues singing ballad]

54:42.713 --> 54:44.747
I can't do it
for really, really.

54:44.749 --> 54:46.582
-Really, really?
-Listen to me.

54:46.584 --> 54:50.886
-Not just really.
-The doctor said that
I have a bullet

54:50.888 --> 54:52.821
lodged in my brain--
a fragment--

54:52.823 --> 54:57.126
and any exertion
will make the fragment shift.

54:58.429 --> 55:01.964
-Wow.
-That's... Yeah, so I can't.

55:01.966 --> 55:05.734
I hope the creepy crawl
went well and that my girls
kept you on your toes.

55:06.304 --> 55:07.503
Yeah, they were great.

55:08.673 --> 55:09.838
I'm a seven guy.

55:10.841 --> 55:12.608
I'm kind of seeing somebody.

55:12.610 --> 55:16.679
It's new, and she thinks
I'm LGBQ barbecue

55:16.681 --> 55:20.649
or whatever the thing is,
but no, no.

55:21.118 --> 55:22.518
Okay.

55:22.520 --> 55:24.119
Well, there's one way
to solve that problem.

55:24.121 --> 55:25.487
Mm-hmm?

55:25.990 --> 55:27.323
[grunts]

55:29.493 --> 55:31.093
[both grunt]

55:31.095 --> 55:32.261
[gasps]

55:32.863 --> 55:36.432
Well, she must be crazy

55:36.434 --> 55:40.135
because you don't feel
LGBTQ to me.

55:40.137 --> 55:42.805
[grunts]
That's what I keep trying
to tell her.

55:42.807 --> 55:46.175
Hey, Sweat.
Your work station's ready.

55:51.315 --> 55:55.150
Now, this will be
a really nice story
for you to tell.

55:55.152 --> 55:58.387
-You don't wanna pass
that up, do you?
-No.

55:58.389 --> 56:02.825
You don't wanna pass
that up. No.

56:02.827 --> 56:05.227
-Your breath smells so good.
-Yeah?

56:06.197 --> 56:08.831
[whispers] I can also smell
like pineapples.

56:08.833 --> 56:10.899
I can taste like pineapples.

56:10.901 --> 56:12.801
No! No!

56:12.803 --> 56:15.070
No, Jo!

56:16.340 --> 56:17.740
Do you wanna hear the story?

56:18.709 --> 56:19.842
Sure.

56:19.844 --> 56:21.543
But from over there.

56:24.682 --> 56:25.781
Okay.

56:38.929 --> 56:42.831
Once upon a time,
in a land far, far away

56:42.833 --> 56:46.435
with beautiful hills
and valleys...

56:48.739 --> 56:50.572
there was a girl named Jo.

56:51.609 --> 56:55.144
And Jo,
she really liked this guy,

56:55.846 --> 56:59.815
and his name was Archie.

57:01.218 --> 57:03.852
-Archie was a big guy.
-Mm-hmm.

57:03.854 --> 57:05.788
He was like an African king.

57:06.791 --> 57:10.592
And all Jo wanted
to do with Archie

57:12.129 --> 57:15.998
was to have him crack her ass.

57:22.907 --> 57:24.773
So, crack her ass.

57:32.249 --> 57:35.017
All I think about
is tacos and pussy.

57:36.053 --> 57:39.254
[doctor] <i> No, no. No tacos.</i>
<i>No pussy.</i>

57:39.256 --> 57:42.558
[Archie] <i> My balls and cock</i>
<i>are about to be cut off</i>
<i>by some psycho bitch.</i>

57:43.561 --> 57:45.327
You're done. [laughing]

57:49.300 --> 57:52.734
[Jo] <i> Let me be</i>
<i>the monster fuck of your life.</i>

58:09.987 --> 58:12.087
[ballad ends]

58:15.292 --> 58:16.825
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

58:16.827 --> 58:20.462
Shit. Dude. Wake up. Wake up.

58:20.464 --> 58:21.997
I had a nightmare. Wake up.

58:23.033 --> 58:26.001
[grunting]

58:29.106 --> 58:30.939
Did you forget
we have a mission?

58:30.941 --> 58:32.774
Find the code
that deciphers the ledgers?

58:32.776 --> 58:34.309
Bring down the syndicate?

58:34.311 --> 58:35.978
I found the code.

58:35.980 --> 58:37.346
And it's not a flash drive.

58:37.348 --> 58:39.348
Then let's get the fuck
out of here.

58:39.950 --> 58:41.149
Why don't you chill?

58:41.151 --> 58:42.885
Dude,
I blew up a cop last night.

58:42.887 --> 58:45.053
That's why I'm in a rush.
This ain't my jam!

58:45.055 --> 58:47.523
-Why would you blow a cop?
-Blew up!

58:47.525 --> 58:50.626
What the fuck are you doing
banging some girl
you're supposed to arrest?

58:50.628 --> 58:52.828
First of all,
I didn't have sex with her.

58:52.830 --> 58:55.397
Second of all,
why are you blowing cops?

58:55.399 --> 58:56.832
Let me tell you something.

58:56.834 --> 58:59.735
If my dream is right,
and they usually are,

58:59.737 --> 59:01.904
these psycho fucks aren't
gonna let us last for long.

59:01.906 --> 59:04.673
We need to get the fuck
out of here!

59:04.675 --> 59:06.408
You need to chill.

59:07.211 --> 59:08.610
And act black.

59:09.713 --> 59:11.880
-It's hard, man.
-You're telling me.

59:11.882 --> 59:13.015
I'm very white.

59:13.017 --> 59:16.418
Be cool. And act black.

59:16.420 --> 59:18.387
And don't blow no more cops.

59:27.865 --> 59:29.231
Hey, Sweat. Check this out.

59:33.037 --> 59:35.237
I figured it out. It's easy.

59:35.239 --> 59:36.939
Show him how it's done, Jo.

59:36.941 --> 59:40.943
Okay, so,
you just plug the program
into your laptop,

59:40.945 --> 59:42.578
you log into your bank account,

59:42.580 --> 59:46.048
then you put in
the amount right here.

59:46.050 --> 59:47.282
Here.

59:49.353 --> 59:51.620
-[beeping]
-You swipe the card,

59:51.622 --> 59:56.592
then you swipe it again
to check the balance, and...

59:58.128 --> 59:59.962
Whoop! There it is!

59:59.964 --> 01:00:02.464
And just one swipe and
the money's in the gift cards.

01:00:05.069 --> 01:00:07.235
If they can do the cards
without us, we're fucked.

01:00:07.237 --> 01:00:09.438
So, I'm thinking to myself...

01:00:11.475 --> 01:00:14.676
what the fuck
do we need you guys for, huh?

01:00:15.579 --> 01:00:17.746
Still gotta get the cash
off the cards.

01:00:17.748 --> 01:00:21.283
If you can't do that,
it's a whole 'nother rigamaroo.

01:00:21.285 --> 01:00:23.885
[phone ringing]

01:00:23.887 --> 01:00:26.188
-Who's that, Archie?
-It's personal.

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:27.956
Hey, teddy bear.

01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:30.492
Just checking on you. You good?

01:00:30.494 --> 01:00:32.294
Yeah, I'm good. What's up?

01:00:32.296 --> 01:00:34.630
Nothing. Just chilling.
Waiting for you.

01:00:34.632 --> 01:00:38.367
And I wanted to tell you
that I been thinking about you.

01:00:39.169 --> 01:00:40.435
A lot.

01:00:40.437 --> 01:00:42.671
Like all night.

01:00:42.673 --> 01:00:44.840
That's weird.
I thought about you too.

01:00:44.842 --> 01:00:47.342
It's weird how I don't even care
that you're a homeowner.

01:00:47.344 --> 01:00:49.177
I told you, I rent.

01:00:49.179 --> 01:00:51.113
Last night,
I could've cracked the ass

01:00:51.115 --> 01:00:53.281
of this beautiful
African goddess.

01:00:53.283 --> 01:00:54.616
But I didn't. You know why?

01:00:54.618 --> 01:00:56.618
Because I didn't wanna
mess up our thing.

01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:59.154
That's cute,
but we're not a thing.

01:00:59.156 --> 01:01:02.057
Well, I'm just saying, you know,
in case we become a thing.

01:01:02.926 --> 01:01:05.027
That's sweet.

01:01:05.029 --> 01:01:07.462
You do know that I had the whole
rugby team in here last night

01:01:07.464 --> 01:01:08.664
for a gang bang?

01:01:08.666 --> 01:01:11.266
-Did you wear a pink wig?
-Always.

01:01:11.268 --> 01:01:13.301
[laughs]
Then it's not a problem.

01:01:13.303 --> 01:01:14.770
What are you doing now?

01:01:14.772 --> 01:01:17.639
We found this website,
of the programmer.

01:01:17.641 --> 01:01:21.643
Yup.
We take our nice, fancy cards
to a nice, friendly bank,

01:01:21.645 --> 01:01:23.378
like in the Caymans,

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:26.815
and they will swipe the money
directly into our new account.

01:01:26.817 --> 01:01:28.483
So, there's a website. Wow.

01:01:28.485 --> 01:01:31.286
You're not the only smart one
in the room anymore.

01:01:31.288 --> 01:01:33.755
Bit of a useless fudgie now,
aren't you?

01:01:34.692 --> 01:01:37.292
I mean, useless seems
a little harsh.

01:01:37.294 --> 01:01:40.228
I mean, I feel I contribute
in many ways.

01:01:41.832 --> 01:01:44.700
Do you wanna hang out later?
Like tonight?

01:01:44.702 --> 01:01:45.801
Yeah, call me.

01:01:48.906 --> 01:01:50.572
Well, this was fun, boys,

01:01:50.574 --> 01:01:53.508
but I'm afraid our time together
has come to an end.

01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:56.812
Wittings,
take care of our guests, please.

01:01:56.814 --> 01:01:58.080
My pleasure, madam.

01:01:58.082 --> 01:01:59.581
[Pernilla]
<i> Take care of our guests.</i>

01:01:59.583 --> 01:02:01.249
[Spyder] <i> What do we need</i>
<i> you guys for?</i>

01:02:01.251 --> 01:02:03.518
<i>Bit of a useless fudgie now,</i>
<i>aren't you?</i>

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:07.022
[Pernilla]
<i>If any man fucks with me,</i>
<i>or my family...</i>

01:02:07.024 --> 01:02:10.492
I cut their cock and balls off.

01:02:10.494 --> 01:02:11.927
Hey! What'd I miss?

01:02:11.929 --> 01:02:14.096
He's a cop!

01:02:14.098 --> 01:02:17.999
What the fuck are you...
What's wrong with you?

01:02:18.001 --> 01:02:20.202
-[Spyder] What did you say?
-He's a cop!

01:02:20.204 --> 01:02:23.772
Sweat, stop playing, man.
They don't know how we play.
He's joking.

01:02:23.774 --> 01:02:26.374
-See if he's wearing a wire.
-Wait, wait, wait.

01:02:26.376 --> 01:02:28.543
-Sweat, that's not
fucking funny, man.
-What the fuck is going on?

01:02:28.545 --> 01:02:30.011
His name is Jack Carter.

01:02:30.013 --> 01:02:33.081
He was narco, LAPD.
Now he's DEA.

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:34.850
Stop fucking around, Sweat!

01:02:34.852 --> 01:02:37.853
And my name's not Sweat.
It's Archie Moses.

01:02:37.855 --> 01:02:39.354
I'm Archie Moses.

01:02:39.356 --> 01:02:41.957
-He went undercover as me.
-Goddamn.

01:02:41.959 --> 01:02:43.425
You know what?

01:02:43.427 --> 01:02:44.893
Check out my wallet.

01:02:44.895 --> 01:02:47.362
I told you we had a chance.

01:02:47.364 --> 01:02:49.531
I wasn't feeling it.
I wanted to get out of here.

01:02:49.533 --> 01:02:52.067
I told you to act black
and be cool!

01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:54.870
I can't be black and cool.
I'm white, uncool.

01:02:54.872 --> 01:02:56.772
All right?
Now, it's every man for himself.

01:02:56.774 --> 01:02:58.240
[Spyder] There's no ID in there.

01:02:58.242 --> 01:02:59.407
You know what?

01:02:59.409 --> 01:03:01.543
September, 1994.

01:03:01.545 --> 01:03:03.545
<i>Beats and Rhymes.</i>
We're on the cover.

01:03:03.547 --> 01:03:05.013
What the fuck are you doing?

01:03:05.816 --> 01:03:07.249
-Fucked up. Fucked up.
-Fuck you!

01:03:07.251 --> 01:03:08.683
-[Jack] Are you crazy?
-[Archie] Fuck off.

01:03:13.991 --> 01:03:15.524
[Jo] Holy shit!

01:03:18.762 --> 01:03:21.163
You rat fuck!

01:03:21.165 --> 01:03:22.898
[Pernilla]
Why would you confess now?

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:25.167
Why? Because
you were gonna whack us!

01:03:25.169 --> 01:03:26.835
-No, we weren't.
-[Archie] You were.

01:03:26.837 --> 01:03:28.804
We're useless. You said that.

01:03:28.806 --> 01:03:31.106
You said our time together
has come to an end.

01:03:31.108 --> 01:03:33.308
Figure of speech!

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:37.112
-Huh?
-Figure of speech,
you fucking idiot.

01:03:37.114 --> 01:03:39.347
So that's why
you wouldn't crack my ass.

01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:42.184
[laughs] Fuck,
I feel so much better.

01:03:42.186 --> 01:03:45.153
[phone ringing]

01:03:47.524 --> 01:03:51.526
[Spyder] So Carter, or Moses,
or what-the-fuck-ever
you're called,

01:03:51.528 --> 01:03:53.795
is it true what this oke says?

01:03:53.797 --> 01:03:57.532
Did you... Did you pull him
into the whole plan?

01:03:57.534 --> 01:04:00.969
Are you a rat-fuck
motherfucking undercover cop?

01:04:00.971 --> 01:04:03.638
Your preference as
to what happens to them, madam?

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:07.342
I'm sure the Schmidt Wine Farm
has a deserted work shed.

01:04:07.344 --> 01:04:10.512
Take these two out there
and find out what we need
to know.

01:04:10.514 --> 01:04:11.613
Fuck.

01:04:11.615 --> 01:04:13.148
I ratted him out.

01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:14.716
This is the life for me!

01:04:14.718 --> 01:04:16.017
I like water!

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:17.319
I like the fucking boat!

01:04:17.321 --> 01:04:18.887
I like naked fucking bitches!

01:04:18.889 --> 01:04:20.622
This is where I should live!

01:04:20.624 --> 01:04:21.957
I'm a Schmidt guy!

01:04:21.959 --> 01:04:23.158
A Schmidt guy, Mom.

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:25.227
Adopt me, motherfuckers!

01:04:30.133 --> 01:04:32.167
Hey, man, you mad at me?

01:04:32.169 --> 01:04:35.170
Listen, it was just like
that dream I had that
you wouldn't listen to.

01:04:35.172 --> 01:04:38.173
It was a freaky premonition
and I was sure we were both
gonna die.

01:04:38.175 --> 01:04:40.508
I just knew it.
I felt it in my gut.

01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:43.211
And I was like,
"One of us should live,"
and I chose me.

01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:44.746
That's understandable.

01:04:44.748 --> 01:04:46.414
I got a lot more going on,
I feel,

01:04:46.416 --> 01:04:48.583
so I said,
"Yeah, I will be me. I'll live."

01:04:48.585 --> 01:04:50.151
So, I own that.

01:04:50.153 --> 01:04:51.753
But it's your fault.
You should've listened to me.

01:04:51.755 --> 01:04:53.355
You had a chance
to talk me down.

01:04:53.357 --> 01:04:55.357
So, fuck you for not listening,

01:04:55.359 --> 01:04:56.825
fuck you
for not letting me share.

01:04:56.827 --> 01:04:58.727
A guy wants to share,
you let him share, man.

01:04:58.729 --> 01:05:00.929
You had your chance. Fuck it.

01:05:00.931 --> 01:05:02.097
Damn.

01:05:04.167 --> 01:05:05.800
The Schmidt Wine Farm.

01:05:06.370 --> 01:05:08.069
Deserted shed.

01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:10.238
Where no one can hear us scream.
This is good.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.774
We should build a lamp,
so we don't have to fuck
in the dark.

01:05:12.776 --> 01:05:14.609
Got the chains here,
which is good.

01:05:14.611 --> 01:05:17.545
You could just wrap them
around us. Maybe stretch
my back out.

01:05:17.547 --> 01:05:20.515
-Wooden chairs.
-Can I take the one
on the right?

01:05:20.517 --> 01:05:23.451
It's kind of... Thank you.
It's an aisle seat. Thanks, man.

01:05:23.453 --> 01:05:25.787
I like your mustache,
I like the guns.

01:05:25.789 --> 01:05:27.622
-These guys are good, man.
-Is that on safety?

01:05:27.624 --> 01:05:29.624
You can't point a gun
if it's not on safety.

01:05:29.626 --> 01:05:31.393
Yeah,
that's not proper gun etiquette.

01:05:31.395 --> 01:05:33.328
Zip ties, normal shit.

01:05:34.631 --> 01:05:36.731
Ah! Goddamn!

01:05:36.733 --> 01:05:38.199
Make sure you get
those arms tight.

01:05:38.201 --> 01:05:39.968
If I get one out,
I will jack off.

01:05:39.970 --> 01:05:42.871
You know, I am a
jack-off-when-I'm-about-to-die
guy.

01:05:42.873 --> 01:05:44.773
I just always wanna
go out nutting.

01:05:44.775 --> 01:05:47.142
-Look at this right here.
-That's old school.

01:05:47.144 --> 01:05:51.046
We got car batteries,
we got a couple clamps there,
one for each ball.

01:05:51.048 --> 01:05:53.048
-[Jack] That's old school.
-I'm gonna need three.
You know that.

01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:55.684
And they're a little rusty,
so I'm gonna get tetanus.

01:05:56.253 --> 01:05:58.053
Oh!

01:05:58.055 --> 01:06:00.422
Well, well, well, well.

01:06:00.424 --> 01:06:02.557
-Wow! That's aggressive, man!
-[Jack] Shit!

01:06:02.559 --> 01:06:05.460
You dumb fuckers messed
with the wrong South Africans.

01:06:05.462 --> 01:06:07.095
-[spits] Whoa!
-[Jack] Shit!

01:06:07.097 --> 01:06:08.830
[Spyder] Stop whining
like a little pussy.

01:06:08.832 --> 01:06:10.765
-I am a little pussy!
-Take it like a man!
Are you ready?

01:06:10.767 --> 01:06:12.734
-Take it like a man.
-One, take it like a man.

01:06:12.736 --> 01:06:14.269
It's coming.
Are you ready, <i> boet?</i>

01:06:14.271 --> 01:06:16.671
-Take it like a man.
-[Spyder] One! Two! Three!

01:06:16.673 --> 01:06:19.908
Bwah! Didn't see
that one coming, did you?

01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:22.944
Huh, <i> boet?</i>
Fucking betrayed me, man!

01:06:22.946 --> 01:06:25.613
I thought we were friends!
And you fucked it all up!

01:06:25.615 --> 01:06:28.316
-I am gonna fuck you up so bad.
-[Spyder] Really?

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:30.418
Question.
Why are you so aggressive?

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:32.153
-This whole family's loud and--
-[Spyder] Shut the fuck up.

01:06:32.155 --> 01:06:33.588
-Shut the fuck up.
-Sorry.

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:36.424
And tell me this.
Who do you work for?

01:06:36.426 --> 01:06:38.793
Well, Pinkie
was my last employer...

01:06:38.795 --> 01:06:40.862
Who the fuck do you work for?

01:06:40.864 --> 01:06:44.299
Black guy, black hair,
pretty dark, Mandela...

01:06:44.301 --> 01:06:45.433
[shushing]

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:48.303
-Apartheid.
-I've got it. I've got it.

01:06:48.305 --> 01:06:54.009
Wittings, I want you
to fucking break his chest open

01:06:54.011 --> 01:06:57.012
and I want you to personally
shit on his heart.

01:06:57.014 --> 01:07:01.816
Then I want you
to slap his little fucking
dinky head off

01:07:01.818 --> 01:07:03.651
and shove it up his ass,

01:07:03.653 --> 01:07:06.454
followed by one
of those fucking chain saws.

01:07:07.124 --> 01:07:09.791
Then for Mr. Big over here,

01:07:09.793 --> 01:07:12.660
I think snap
his little twinkie off

01:07:12.662 --> 01:07:15.196
-and shove it
down his fucking throat.
-Oh!

01:07:15.198 --> 01:07:20.668
But do it all in pursuit
of getting me the information.

01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:21.970
What information?

01:07:21.972 --> 01:07:24.706
Who do you fucking work for?

01:07:24.708 --> 01:07:27.809
So everything else
is in that order, though,
except for the chainsaw?

01:07:31.381 --> 01:07:33.548
I tell you what. I've got it.

01:07:35.886 --> 01:07:38.319
See that shit
that he grows around his lip,

01:07:38.321 --> 01:07:40.422
that grows wildly on my ass?

01:07:40.424 --> 01:07:46.761
Take a long razor and give him
a nice... nice smooth shave.

01:07:46.763 --> 01:07:47.862
Oh, yeah.

01:07:47.864 --> 01:07:50.665
Take that thing off his face.

01:07:50.667 --> 01:07:53.601
I've noticed that everything
that comes out of your mouth

01:07:53.603 --> 01:07:57.705
has a theme
of dick, asshole, balls.

01:07:57.707 --> 01:08:01.709
I said I had three balls,
your eyes lit up like
a fucking slot machine.

01:08:01.711 --> 01:08:05.213
Like, "Three balls?
I can suck on three balls.

01:08:05.215 --> 01:08:08.850
At once. I'm used to two.
I can put another ball
in my mouth."

01:08:08.852 --> 01:08:10.718
He's funny, huh?
He's really funny.

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:14.722
If you guys are interested
and I-- You can fuck us now.

01:08:14.724 --> 01:08:18.093
Whoa, whoa! Just for the record,
I'm opting out of that part.

01:08:18.095 --> 01:08:19.861
Do you wanna fuck me, baldy?

01:08:19.863 --> 01:08:21.763
Seriously, you wanna just stick
your big fucking cock

01:08:21.765 --> 01:08:23.298
right up
what's left of my asshole?

01:08:24.468 --> 01:08:27.102
Hemorrhoids. It's tight.
You just shove your fucking--

01:08:27.104 --> 01:08:29.470
Shut the fuck up!
Just shut the fuck up!

01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:34.709
Get the info before I fucking
shit my fucking pants.

01:08:34.711 --> 01:08:37.312
Hurry back
while my dick's still hard!

01:08:42.819 --> 01:08:44.586
Jo, how much more time
do you need?

01:08:44.587 --> 01:08:46.386
Ugh. Twenty minutes.

01:08:46.389 --> 01:08:49.290
$625 million
is a lot of cash to transfer.

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:52.093
[Pernilla]
You've got 15 minutes.

01:08:52.095 --> 01:08:55.229
Those fuckers kept on
talking and talking,
but they didn't say shit.

01:08:55.232 --> 01:08:57.564
-What are we gonna do with them?
-[Pernilla] No loose ends.

01:08:57.567 --> 01:09:00.401
We have 625 million reasons

01:09:00.403 --> 01:09:02.036
not to get caught.

01:09:10.981 --> 01:09:12.981
We're not gonna make it
out of here, are we?

01:09:12.983 --> 01:09:14.381
[Jack groans]

01:09:17.187 --> 01:09:18.786
Probably not.

01:09:18.787 --> 01:09:21.389
I'm sorry I got you
involved in this.

01:09:22.993 --> 01:09:26.161
You know,
I've done a lot of bad stuff
in my life, so...

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:29.531
It's one of the reasons
I came out here,
just trying to do better.

01:09:30.033 --> 01:09:31.499
Trying to help.

01:09:32.335 --> 01:09:35.670
So, if it happens, fuck it.

01:09:37.874 --> 01:09:39.107
Really? You're that Zen?

01:09:41.144 --> 01:09:46.447
No, not really. I mean,
I don't want it to happen,
but if it does, so be it.

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:51.819
You're a weird dude, Archie.

01:09:51.821 --> 01:09:53.354
I gotta tell you...

01:09:54.391 --> 01:09:56.257
you testifying against me...

01:09:57.527 --> 01:10:00.361
was probably the best thing
that ever happened to me.

01:10:00.363 --> 01:10:03.198
-Stop bullshitting.
-I mean it.

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:05.700
I used to look up to people
like the Schmidts.

01:10:05.702 --> 01:10:09.704
They were my heroes.
I liked their lifestyle.
I liked everything about them.

01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:13.408
And then when I did my time,
'cause of you,

01:10:14.244 --> 01:10:15.743
I saw that they were
just assholes.

01:10:15.745 --> 01:10:19.214
They're just rich assholes,
psychos, bad people.

01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:21.649
I don't wanna be that.

01:10:22.886 --> 01:10:24.586
So, a belated thank you.

01:10:24.588 --> 01:10:28.590
It's all right, man.
Look, it's cool.

01:10:28.592 --> 01:10:34.028
Look at this, just two guys
verbally sucking each other off,

01:10:34.030 --> 01:10:36.097
just being okay
with it at the end.

01:10:36.099 --> 01:10:38.166
We're not sucking each other.
We're having a convers--

01:10:38.168 --> 01:10:40.101
-Verbally.
-Well, yeah, but still you--

01:10:40.103 --> 01:10:42.937
I mean, it feels good.
Does it not feel like...

01:10:42.939 --> 01:10:44.672
You know what?

01:10:44.674 --> 01:10:47.408
I got... some slack here.

01:10:47.410 --> 01:10:50.178
-Slack's good.
-Right here.

01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:52.247
I think I got a plan.

01:10:52.249 --> 01:10:54.082
Why didn't you have that
an hour ago?

01:10:54.084 --> 01:10:55.950
-I just got the slack.
-All right.

01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:00.855
This is the plan.
Just keep him distracted.

01:11:00.857 --> 01:11:04.592
Hey, buddy.
I was thinking about you.
I may have been a little rough.

01:11:04.594 --> 01:11:07.462
But my balls are itching.

01:11:07.464 --> 01:11:09.897
I don't know if it's the crabs
or something I caught out here.

01:11:09.899 --> 01:11:12.600
I don't know if--
how buried it is down there,

01:11:12.602 --> 01:11:15.236
but it feels like something
that needs to be scratched.

01:11:15.238 --> 01:11:17.805
I don't know
if it's something you'd do?

01:11:17.807 --> 01:11:20.708
[chuckles] I'm happy to see
that you've retained
your keen sense of humor.

01:11:20.710 --> 01:11:22.777
It's tough to shake, man.
It's kind of who I am.

01:11:22.779 --> 01:11:26.814
Can't wait to see
the hilarity that ensues
when I perforate your patella.

01:11:26.816 --> 01:11:28.116
-My what?
-[drill whirs]

01:11:28.118 --> 01:11:29.250
Your patella.

01:11:29.252 --> 01:11:31.552
The way you said it, is like...

01:11:31.554 --> 01:11:33.554
Is it something
you put on bread?

01:11:33.556 --> 01:11:34.622
Your patella.

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:36.824
-[whirring]
-[Jack] Whoa!

01:11:36.826 --> 01:11:38.092
My what?

01:11:38.094 --> 01:11:39.661
[laughs]

01:11:39.663 --> 01:11:41.229
[Wittings] You bastard!

01:11:42.098 --> 01:11:43.197
Nice.

01:11:47.904 --> 01:11:51.005
-Whoo! That's a good plan.
-That's the plan.

01:11:51.007 --> 01:11:52.407
[Wittings] Fuck! Fucker!

01:26:19.642 --> 01:26:21.975
Is it? You twat!

01:26:21.977 --> 01:26:24.278
[laughs] Secure this.

01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:25.379
Come on, guys.

01:26:25.814 --> 01:26:28.015
Okay. Okay!

01:26:28.017 --> 01:26:31.485
Drop it,
because I will shoot you.

01:26:31.487 --> 01:26:32.819
And you're hard to miss.

01:26:32.821 --> 01:26:34.354
[scoffs]

01:26:35.524 --> 01:26:37.191
Drop it! Now!

01:26:40.129 --> 01:26:41.762
Drop the fucking gun!

01:26:42.131 --> 01:26:43.263
I said--

01:26:45.367 --> 01:26:46.867
-[laughs]
-[Archie] Ah!

01:26:46.869 --> 01:26:48.869
You should've fuckin' blown
my balls off

01:26:48.871 --> 01:26:50.871
when you had the chance,
motherfucker!

01:26:50.873 --> 01:26:52.506
'Cause now I've got you
by the balls.

01:26:52.508 --> 01:26:53.874
You had a good run.

01:26:53.876 --> 01:26:55.475
Just let my guy go, man.

01:26:55.477 --> 01:26:57.644
I'll let him go
when I wanna let him go.

01:26:57.646 --> 01:27:01.882
Because first,
I'm gonna bleed out
little baby Moses over here.

01:27:01.884 --> 01:27:04.518
And then, I'm gonna cut
your little dick off.

01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:07.421
And then, I'm gonna come
for your mama, bitch!

01:27:07.423 --> 01:27:10.090
Carter, Carter,
shoot him in the face.
I don't give a shit.

01:27:10.092 --> 01:27:12.726
-Yeah, shoot me in the face,
motherfucker!
-I wanna live. I am a pussy.

01:27:12.728 --> 01:27:14.528
Shoot him in the face, man!

01:27:14.530 --> 01:27:16.496
He can't fucking
shoot me in the face
because he's a pussy!

01:27:16.498 --> 01:27:18.732
I give you permission.
Shoot him in the face!

01:27:22.705 --> 01:27:24.004
[Archie] Goddamn it!

01:27:24.006 --> 01:27:25.639
Fuck me!

01:27:28.010 --> 01:27:30.410
Fuck! You fucking puss!

01:27:30.412 --> 01:27:33.480
You fucking shot me
with my own fucking gun,
you fat...

01:27:34.450 --> 01:27:36.283
[groans] Fuck.

01:27:36.285 --> 01:27:39.586
Fuck!
You shot me with my own gun!

01:27:41.023 --> 01:27:44.524
-Jesus!
-Are you in pain? Huh?

01:27:44.526 --> 01:27:46.093
Yeah, I'm fucking in pain!

01:27:46.095 --> 01:27:48.895
Remember what you said.
"If you're dumb, you bleed."

01:27:48.897 --> 01:27:50.697
Guess who's bleeding?

01:27:52.067 --> 01:27:54.234
-Does it hurt right here?
-[screams]

01:27:54.236 --> 01:27:57.738
<i>Jou fucking naai!</i>
<i>Is jy mal in jou kop, </i> man?

01:27:57.740 --> 01:27:58.872
[Archie] Carter!

01:27:58.874 --> 01:28:00.974
You shot me on purpose, man!

01:28:00.976 --> 01:28:02.409
Yeah, I did shoot you
on purpose,

01:28:02.411 --> 01:28:04.511
but I knew what I was doing
when I shot you.

01:28:05.581 --> 01:28:07.147
You're lucky I didn't shoot you
in your head.

01:28:07.149 --> 01:28:08.815
We're even! We're fucking even!

01:28:08.817 --> 01:28:09.983
-No, we're not even.
-Yeah, we're even.

01:28:09.985 --> 01:28:11.485
-We're not even!
-We're even!

01:28:11.487 --> 01:28:13.654
-We're not even.
-Okay, but it's close.

01:28:13.656 --> 01:28:16.957
[shrieks] Goddamn, that hurts!

01:28:22.231 --> 01:28:23.964
Get me some help. Anybody?

01:28:23.966 --> 01:28:25.265
Shut the fuck up, man!

01:28:25.267 --> 01:28:27.234
You shut the fuck up, bitch!

01:28:31.974 --> 01:28:33.206
[Madebe] Good job, Carter.

01:28:33.942 --> 01:28:35.809
It's what I do. Pussy and tacos.

01:28:35.811 --> 01:28:39.513
Just one more thing,
and we'll get all this
cleaned up.

01:28:39.515 --> 01:28:41.081
Where's the code
for the ledgers?

01:28:41.083 --> 01:28:44.217
Ah! You're gonna love this.

01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:46.553
-Yeah?
-Follow me. Check this out.

01:28:48.123 --> 01:28:50.190
-[Jack] Code for the ledgers.
-[Madebe] That's right.

01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:53.727
Ready for this? Wait for it!

01:28:56.765 --> 01:28:59.232
[chuckles] Here's a gift.

01:28:59.802 --> 01:29:00.934
Souvenir.

01:29:02.104 --> 01:29:03.870
At least it's not a flash drive.

01:29:03.872 --> 01:29:05.839
Flesh drive, that's all right.

01:29:05.841 --> 01:29:08.241
You still owe me
a handshake, bitch.

01:29:20.889 --> 01:29:23.123

01:29:50.652 --> 01:29:52.486
Hey, dummy.

01:29:52.488 --> 01:29:54.588
'Bout time.
I was worried about you.

01:29:56.492 --> 01:29:57.724
Hey, congratulations.

01:29:57.726 --> 01:30:00.527
You got the bad guys.
Job well done.

01:30:00.529 --> 01:30:03.163
Well, I didn't exactly
get all the bad guys.

01:30:03.165 --> 01:30:04.331
That's true.

01:30:04.333 --> 01:30:06.366
I got probably
a little bit more,

01:30:06.368 --> 01:30:08.668
but that's just because
I'm built for it.

01:30:08.670 --> 01:30:11.271
Um, don't I deserve
a little credit?

01:30:12.841 --> 01:30:15.242
-Hey, Pink.
-Whoa.

01:30:15.244 --> 01:30:20.013
Hey, Carter. Before I go,
I got a question for you.

01:30:20.015 --> 01:30:25.519
I am thinking about...
becoming a crook again.

01:30:25.521 --> 01:30:29.389
Getting back
into the crook business.
What do you think?

01:30:29.391 --> 01:30:33.260
I gotta tell you,
a couple gift cards
may have fallen into my wallet.

01:30:33.262 --> 01:30:35.595
That's blood money.
You do know that, right?

01:30:35.597 --> 01:30:38.064
I do know that.
And I thought about that,

01:30:38.066 --> 01:30:40.967
but turns out,
it spends just the same.

01:30:40.969 --> 01:30:43.437
They still take it
and they don't even ask
where it comes from.

01:30:44.773 --> 01:30:47.307
No more gravy mop-up for me.
Sorry, Pinkie.

01:30:47.309 --> 01:30:53.313
And I got
a little extra cash on me,
if you would like some.

01:30:53.882 --> 01:30:54.881
[chuckles]

01:30:55.451 --> 01:30:56.516
No, thank you.

01:30:57.386 --> 01:30:58.785
Kind of thought you'd say that.

01:30:59.488 --> 01:31:00.921
Well, I gotta go.

01:31:00.923 --> 01:31:03.156
There's a road out there
with my name on it.

01:31:04.092 --> 01:31:05.759
Oh, and, Pinkie?

01:31:05.761 --> 01:31:08.462
Give my kneepad to the next guy.

01:31:09.097 --> 01:31:13.667
Oh, and... one last thing.

01:31:15.604 --> 01:31:17.304
I never stopped loving you.

01:31:18.507 --> 01:31:20.040
Just want you to know that.

01:31:21.243 --> 01:31:22.309
Take care, Pinkie.

01:31:22.311 --> 01:31:24.511
Still a dick.

[Pink Martini's

01:31:42.264 --> 01:31:43.363
So...

01:31:44.666 --> 01:31:46.600
So?

01:31:49.171 --> 01:31:52.939
Tell me...
what's California like?

01:31:52.941 --> 01:31:55.909
Hmm... Mountains.

01:31:57.045 --> 01:31:58.578
Peaky mountains.

01:32:03.385 --> 01:32:06.486
I been thinking about...
visiting.

01:32:06.488 --> 01:32:07.854
I have a friend out there.

01:32:07.856 --> 01:32:09.789
-Oh, yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

01:32:09.791 --> 01:32:12.859
He's a nice enough guy.
A little bit wacky,
but he's cool.

01:32:15.831 --> 01:32:17.097
Is he a homeowner?

01:32:17.833 --> 01:32:18.965
Mm-mmm.

01:32:20.302 --> 01:32:22.235
He lives in LA.

01:32:28.210 --> 01:32:30.977
-He rents.
-Mm-hmm.

01:32:42.524 --> 01:32:44.190
