<i>[Earl Narrating] With Joy and Darnell</i>
<i>in the Witness Protection program...</i>

<i>[Water Sloshing]</i>

00:12.112 --> 00:15.343
Damn it, Randy. Every night
you're climbing into bed with me.

00:15.448 --> 00:18.906
- You got your own room now.
- There's a scary, scratchy noise out there.

00:19.019 --> 00:22.386
Like a bush rubbing
against the door scratchin'...

00:22.489 --> 00:24.650
or like the Shower Cap Killer scratchin'?

00:24.758 --> 00:27.386
No one's ever heard
the Shower Cap Killer and survived.

00:27.494 --> 00:29.792
Except for that one woman,
and he cut out her tongue.

00:29.896 --> 00:32.262
Until she learns to use a fake one,
it's all just-

00:32.365 --> 00:35.562
[Muffled] The Shower Cap Killer-
He cut out my tongue.

- I can't see anything.
- That makes sense.

<i>But now he found his way back.</i>

01:44.204 --> 01:46.331
Welcome home.

01:46.439 --> 01:50.034
I don't know how to break the news to you,
so I'm just gonna spit it out.

01:50.143 --> 01:54.671
Joy, Darnell and the kids were put into Witness
Protection and we'll never see 'em again.

01:57.383 --> 01:59.442
- He's freaking out.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:59.552 --> 02:02.146
Let's put him in his fish tank
till he calms down.

02:02.255 --> 02:06.783
Hold on, Earl. As long as Darnell's not here,
I've got some unfinished business.

02:06.893 --> 02:08.793
[Gurgles]

02:08.895 --> 02:13.093
That was for ruining my chances with the girl

<i>My name is Earl.</i>

02:18.338 --> 02:21.364

- <i># Wake me up before you go-go #</i>
- Oh, coasters, please.

02:26.946 --> 02:29.005
I just waxed the bar.

02:29.115 --> 02:30.878
I still can't believe you work here now.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.578
Just picking up a couple of shifts
while Darnell's gone.

02:33.686 --> 02:35.881
My I RA's in the dumper.

02:35.989 --> 02:39.049
What you and Ira do behind closed doors
is none of my business.

02:39.159 --> 02:42.686
<i>Hey, you should try something</i>
<i>off Kenny's new martini menu.</i>

02:42.795 --> 02:47.198
- He named the drinks
after <i>Sex and the City</i> characters.
- Earl, I'll bet you're a Carrie.

02:47.300 --> 02:49.495
[Catalina]
I don't want to sound conceited...

02:49.602 --> 02:52.230
but I think Mr. Turtle
just looked at me and licked his lips.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.863
<i>Oh, he's probablyjust hungry.</i>
<i>We haven't fed him yet.</i>

02:54.974 --> 02:59.240
Hold on there, little fella.
I got your food right here.

02:59.345 --> 03:01.575
Darnell-
or as you know him, Mr. Human-

03:01.681 --> 03:03.911
left that for ya.

03:05.285 --> 03:07.185
The hell?

03:07.287 --> 03:09.755
"Dear Earl:

03:09.856 --> 03:12.051
"that means you found Mr. Turtle.

03:12.158 --> 03:14.388
Please call me." And there's a number.

03:14.494 --> 03:16.758
<i>Kenny, let me use the phone.</i>

03:18.998 --> 03:21.967
And I told the jerk,

- <i>[Beeps]</i>
- Hello?

03:36.015 --> 03:40.008
- Darnell?
- So I'm gone for a week
and there's no "Hey, Crabman"?

03:40.119 --> 03:42.087
Well, I guess life goes on.

03:42.188 --> 03:44.088
Hey, Crabman.

03:44.190 --> 03:46.090
Hey, Earl.

03:46.192 --> 03:49.184
So did you find Mr. Turtle,
or did Randy just get into the turtle food?

03:49.295 --> 03:52.890
<i>[Crunching]</i>

03:52.999 --> 03:55.729
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>I told Darnell about finding Mr. Turtle...</i>

03:55.835 --> 03:59.737
<i>so he gave me his new address</i>
<i>for me to ship the little guy to him.</i>

03:59.839 --> 04:02.933
<i>Then he asked me to destroy the paper</i>
<i>I wrote it down for all of our safety.</i>

04:03.042 --> 04:05.602
And don't worry.
I won't give anyone else this phone number.

04:05.712 --> 04:09.512
This phone is dead now anyway.
Good-bye, Earl, and thanks.

04:18.925 --> 04:22.258
<i>You can'tjust ship a turtle, Earl.</i>
<i>It's not like a vase or a person.</i>

04:22.362 --> 04:25.729
You have the address. Why don't you
just drive Mr. Turtle down there yourself?

04:25.832 --> 04:27.766
Bruce!

04:27.867 --> 04:31.098
<i>[Earl Narrating] As I sat there,</i>
<i>I wondered: Was Kenny right?</i>

04:31.204 --> 04:34.469
<i>Was sending the turtle</i>
<i>via snail mail a snafu...</i>

04:34.574 --> 04:38.704
<i>or was I just talking myself</i>
<i>into making</i> me <i>the priority mail?</i>

04:38.811 --> 04:41.075
Screw this. I want a beer.

04:41.180 --> 04:43.705
<i>So the next morning,</i>
<i>me and Mr. Turtle hit the road.</i>

04:43.816 --> 04:46.250
<i>I didn't take Randy</i>
<i>'cause long drives made him carsick...</i>

04:46.352 --> 04:48.843
<i>and the medicine for that made him hungry.</i>

04:48.955 --> 04:51.981
<i>It was an endless cycle</i>
<i>we both wanted to avoid.</i>

04:52.091 --> 04:55.993
<i>I miss Earl already. I know in my heart</i>
<i>it's better that he left me behind...</i>

04:56.095 --> 04:58.893
but it's still weird
sitting here at the bar by myself.

04:58.998 --> 05:01.796
If you want company, the Camden
Men's Glee Club will be performing...

05:01.901 --> 05:03.835
a <i>Top Gun</i> tribute at the air show.

05:03.936 --> 05:06.962
They're holding auditions.
I am hoping for Maverick.

05:07.073 --> 05:11.703
Thanks anyway, but I have to go home
to that empty trailer at some point.

05:21.354 --> 05:23.788
I know what it's like to miss somebody...

05:23.890 --> 05:26.723
especially when the two of you
have been living together.

05:26.826 --> 05:29.192
But it gets easier, I promise you.

05:29.295 --> 05:31.229
- I'm Jim.
- Randy.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.300
Maybe I can take you to a movie later,
help get your mind off things.

05:34.400 --> 05:37.267
Sure. And I'll try not to fill up
on junk food here...

05:37.370 --> 05:39.361
so I can eat a good dinner at the theater.

05:39.472 --> 05:41.531

<i>that I was an exotic pet delivery boy...</i>

05:51.551 --> 05:54.019

06:07.367 --> 06:10.859
My name is Goldie now. Get inside!

06:13.106 --> 06:16.200
L-I'm sorry. I don't want to ruin
your Witness Protection identity, but-

06:16.309 --> 06:18.470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Our lives are in constant danger.

06:18.578 --> 06:20.569
Blah, blah, blah.
I have got bigger fish to fry.

06:20.680 --> 06:23.706
<i>[Earl Narrating]Joy wasn't as concerned</i>
<i>about my presence threatening her life...</i>

06:23.816 --> 06:26.284
<i>as she was worried about it</i>
<i>threatening her social life.</i>

06:26.386 --> 06:29.014
<i>She was having trouble</i>

06:29.122 --> 06:32.614
This is my signature
Swiss Colony cheese ball.

06:32.725 --> 06:35.353
Then for dessert,
we've got a Ritz mock apple pie.

06:35.461 --> 06:38.919
You'll swear it's got real apples in it.
But it's just wet crackers.

06:39.031 --> 06:42.023
No offense, Goldie, but we're really
not used to eating like this.

06:42.135 --> 06:45.195
- What do you mean?
- It's a little high-fat.

06:45.304 --> 06:49.138
<i>Oh, come on, ladies.</i>
<i>Live a little. It's a party.</i>

06:49.242 --> 06:54.009
- Yeah, in a trailer park.
- [Laughing]

06:54.113 --> 06:56.809
Well, you guessed the theme!

06:56.916 --> 06:58.816

06:58.918 --> 07:01.819
Oh! That is funny.

07:01.921 --> 07:04.617

Joy, you spend a decade living by the hog
rendering plant, it's gonna get into your pores.

I lived <i>upwind</i> from Porkweiser.
That's not it.

07:20.006 --> 07:21.974
Snobs like that have always
looked down on me.

07:22.074 --> 07:26.033
In high school, my mom gave me a rabbit
fur jacket for Christmas.

07:26.145 --> 07:28.511
I was so proud to show if off...

07:28.614 --> 07:32.710
till one of those rich girls pointed out
it was a coat she'd given to Goodwill.

07:32.819 --> 07:36.277
She showed everybody
where her pet rabbit had humped it.

07:36.389 --> 07:39.256
- I thought it was a elbow patch.
- I hear ya.

07:39.358 --> 07:41.622
In high school, the rich kids
would make fun of me...

07:41.727 --> 07:43.661
for wearing the same two shirts
over and over.

07:43.763 --> 07:48.029
I swore when I grew up, I'd have
a flannel for every day of the week.

07:48.134 --> 07:51.194
And I do. By God, I do.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.272
I still have a chance with these women.

07:53.372 --> 07:55.340
They haven't decided if I'm in or out.

07:55.441 --> 07:58.308
If they see somebody like you here,
I'm definitely out.

08:52.965 --> 08:55.900
- I gotta get help.
- He's obviously a stray.
Look how dirty his cardigan is.

Just take that thing
back to Camden with you.
