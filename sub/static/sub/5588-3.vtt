00:02.703 --> 00:04.503
              There you go.
         A nice Yummy
         breakfast.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.540
Hey, where's the little
     leprechaun?

00:08.542 --> 00:10.476
          Oh, I think he's still
             getting dressed.

00:10.478 --> 00:13.278
   No, on the box.
This isn't our normal cereal.

00:13.280 --> 00:15.447
           Well, because this is
              the store brand,

00:15.449 --> 00:17.449
                but (crunches)
               it's delicious.

00:17.451 --> 00:21.153
   Okay, guess what. I just got
    an offer to handle a case.

00:21.155 --> 00:23.155
Good, because I think this
cereal is mostly sawdust.

00:23.157 --> 00:26.492
 It is great, it's just
 there's,
    um...slight complication.

00:26.494 --> 00:28.327
              It's for Closets,
                  Closets...

00:28.329 --> 00:29.661
I don't like where
 this is
 going.
                   ...Closets...

00:29.663 --> 00:31.964
Don't say it.
                     ...Closets
   (gasps)

00:31.966 --> 00:33.465
   What did you think
   the last word might be?

00:33.467 --> 00:35.367
Mitchell, you can't work
for your father's rival.

00:35.369 --> 00:37.703
            Hey, wait.
  Why does Grandpa have a rival?

00:37.705 --> 00:39.538
                  Oh, who knows?
            Betrayal.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.006
           Because 30 years ago,

00:41.008 --> 00:43.242
            your grandfather's
            business partner

00:43.244 --> 00:46.412
            and best friend,
            Earl Chambers,

00:46.414 --> 00:48.480
         stole his Rolodex
         with all of his
         clients

00:48.482 --> 00:51.216
     and started his own
     company
     on a day that is now known

00:51.218 --> 00:52.584
   as Black Wednesday Afternoon.

00:52.586 --> 00:54.186
           Nobody calls it that.

00:54.188 --> 00:56.321
    Look, I know that there's
       some history there,

00:56.323 --> 00:57.489
  but can't we all just move on?

00:57.491 --> 00:58.690
             Your father
             hasn't.

00:58.692 --> 01:00.325
            He still crank calls
              Earl every year

01:00.327 --> 01:01.727
              on the anniversary
                  of the day

01:01.729 --> 01:04.096
         that is now known as
      Black Wednesday Afternoon.

01:04.098 --> 01:05.497
I really need this job.

01:05.498 --> 01:07.032
                   At
                   least
             tell your dad
             first

01:07.034 --> 01:08.400
                and spare him
               the pain I felt

01:08.402 --> 01:10.069
               when I found
               out
                you were still

01:10.071 --> 01:11.603
           getting your hair cut
                at Miguel's.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.205
Wait, what did Miguel
   do to you again?

01:13.207 --> 01:15.240
      He recommended a shampoo
    for thinning hair, Mitchell.

01:15.242 --> 01:20.279
Maybe we can use this to fix
the loose tile in the bathroom.

01:20.281 --> 01:23.282
                      ♪♪

01:34.195 --> 01:36.528
Hey, Mr. Dunphy, can we have
just a moment of your time?

01:36.530 --> 01:39.631
         Come on, now. How long
       have we known each other?

01:39.633 --> 01:41.767
               We should be on
             a first-name
             basis.

01:41.769 --> 01:44.236
   Better yet, a nickname basis,
             Vitamin D.

01:44.238 --> 01:45.637
    Glad to hear you say that,

01:45.639 --> 01:47.372
   'cause, um, we have a favor
           to ask you.

01:47.374 --> 01:48.540
        You know how Dyl--

01:49.243 --> 01:52.544
      Vitamin D has his own
        t-shirt business?

01:52.546 --> 01:54.446
            Oh, I should've seen
                this coming.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.315
                 Um...yes,
           I will model for you,

01:56.317 --> 01:58.584
             but I'm gonna need
           to own the negatives.

01:58.586 --> 01:59.718
           Okay, great.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.220
              Also,
      we were kind of hoping

02:01.222 --> 02:02.788
      that Dylan could stay
         in the basement

02:02.790 --> 02:04.289
             with me
       for a little while.

02:04.291 --> 02:06.458
                          Oh.
     He's trying to save up

02:06.460 --> 02:08.560
     to build inventory,
     and rent is killing him.

02:08.562 --> 02:10.429
    It feels like
they're asking for money,

02:10.431 --> 02:12.564
like, every six weeks.

02:12.566 --> 02:13.832
             I don't know,
             guys.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.667
             Moving in
             together,
              that's a big step.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.803
            It's just
       for a little while.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.605
             Please?

02:19.607 --> 02:21.640
          (chuckles) I guess
     if your mom's okay with
     it,

02:21.642 --> 02:23.142
              I'm okay with it.

02:23.144 --> 02:25.777
      Oh, um, and could you
         ask her for us?

02:25.779 --> 02:28.113
        I'll give it a shot,
   but it'll be the second thing

02:28.115 --> 02:30.115
            I've talked her into
               this morning,

02:30.117 --> 02:33.352
     and it'll be a <i> lot</i>
     trickier
     now that she's fully
     awake.

02:33.354 --> 02:35.587
      Hey, hon.
Do you have a minute?

02:35.589 --> 02:37.289
                 Just.
        I can't be late to work.

02:37.291 --> 02:39.825
   We are unveiling a new closet
      today -- The Trulhatten.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.827
             It's Swedish,
        it's cheap, it's modern.

02:41.829 --> 02:44.096
           We're gonna grab Ikea
             by the meatballs.

02:44.098 --> 02:47.332
Listen, I was talking
to Haley and Dylan --
                          Ugh.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.668
    They want to know if he
    can stay in the basement
    for a few weeks.

02:49.670 --> 02:52.471
      Oh, Phil,
I think that's a bad idea.

02:52.473 --> 02:54.606
         They're adults,
    and Dylan really has been

02:54.608 --> 02:56.775
getting his act together.
        This doesn't bother you?

02:56.777 --> 02:58.443
I don't enjoy having to get
    your approval

02:58.445 --> 02:59.912
   for everything,
but that's the deal I made.

03:01.348 --> 03:04.449
               Haley and Dylan
               in her bedroom.

03:04.451 --> 03:06.351
    They're doing
 what they're doing.

03:06.353 --> 03:08.120
 I say we be evolved
      about it.

03:08.122 --> 03:09.621
                    Fine.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.890
        If you're really okay
      with our precious daughter

03:11.892 --> 03:14.293
          shacking up with her
        ne'er-do-well boyfriend,

03:14.295 --> 03:15.727
                  so be it.

03:15.729 --> 03:18.163
I just don't want them sneaking
around like we had to.

03:18.165 --> 03:20.632
The scariest moment of my life
was that pantsless conversation

03:20.634 --> 03:22.534
 I had with your dad
through the Dutch door.

03:24.305 --> 03:26.605
         (Skype ringing)

03:27.808 --> 03:29.474
              How lazy are you?

03:29.476 --> 03:32.077
      If you want to talk to us,
        just come downstairs.

03:32.079 --> 03:34.713
<i>Luke, I'm at college. I don't</i>
<i>even live there anymore.</i>

03:34.715 --> 03:36.648
                   And..
           you have been missed.

03:36.650 --> 03:38.350
      <i> Whatever.</i>
<i>I'll try mom in the car.</i>

03:38.352 --> 03:40.252
<i>I really need to talk to her</i>
   <i> about something.</i>

03:40.254 --> 03:41.553
        Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.422
                  (chuckles)
              I'm here for you.

03:43.424 --> 03:44.489
                What's wrong?

03:44.491 --> 03:46.491
     <i> Well, okay.</i>
     <i> It's</i>
     <i> Sanjay.</i>

03:46.493 --> 03:48.894
<i>I feel like he's been</i>
     <i> avoiding</i>
     <i> me.</i>

03:48.896 --> 03:50.495
                    Whoa.

03:50.497 --> 03:52.397
       <i> I know.</i>
<i>He's been really distant.</i>

03:52.399 --> 03:53.832
       Uh, tell me all about it.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.701
           And don't
           worry.
     Take all the time you
     need.

03:55.703 --> 03:59.504
<i>Well (sighs) he never really</i>
<i>texts me back anymore.</i>

03:59.506 --> 04:01.273
<i>Maybe I should confront him</i>
      <i> about it?</i>

04:01.275 --> 04:03.275
                 Yes! Do it!

04:03.277 --> 04:04.676
 <i> Yeah. You know</i>
 <i> what?</i>
    <i> You are right.</i>

04:04.678 --> 04:06.445
  <i> I'm totally going</i>
<i>to call him right now,</i>

04:06.447 --> 04:08.347
<i>and I'm going to tell him</i>
<i>he can't treat me this way.</i>

04:08.349 --> 04:10.682
                No, no, no.
           No, no, please don't.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.951
<i>Fine, whatever. I get it.</i>
<i>I'll give him some more space.</i>

04:12.953 --> 04:14.353
              You could practice
                  right now

04:14.355 --> 04:15.420
              and take a scootch
                to your right.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.355
        <i> What?</i>

04:16.357 --> 04:17.623
     <i> Who are you talking to?</i>

04:17.625 --> 04:19.591
         <i> Oh!</i>

04:19.593 --> 04:21.293
     <i> My brother.</i>

04:21.295 --> 04:22.794
           <i> He's cute.</i>
  <i> Mm.</i>

04:22.796 --> 04:24.129
       <i> Hi, Alex's brother.</i>

04:24.131 --> 04:25.697
              (deep voice) Hey.
                  I'm Luke.

04:25.699 --> 04:26.765
                 Who are you?

04:26.767 --> 04:28.300
    <i> Ugh.</i>
             <i> Brie.</i>

04:28.302 --> 04:30.135
            <i> (chuckles)</i>
      <i> I live down the hall.</i>

04:30.137 --> 04:31.470
    <i> Just borrowing a dress.</i>
         <i> Thanks, Alex.</i>
 <i> Mm.</i>

04:31.472 --> 04:33.472
                <i> Bye.</i>
<i>Bye, Luke.</i>

04:33.474 --> 04:34.773
              I-I lift weights!
            (beep)

04:34.775 --> 04:36.875
    (cellphone rings, beeps)
Hey, what's up?

04:36.877 --> 04:39.378
              Manny, you and I
           are going to college.

04:39.380 --> 04:40.712
 You sure are,
 buddy.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.581
 Who cares what that
guidance counselor said?

04:42.583 --> 04:44.616
            Look, there's a girl
            in my sister's dorm

04:44.618 --> 04:45.884
            who's super into me,

04:45.886 --> 04:47.653
    and she's got a hot roommate
              for you.

04:47.655 --> 04:49.821
How hot?
      Use your imagination.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.657
      Holy cow.

04:51.659 --> 04:53.492
I guess it would help
take my mind off of Carly.

04:53.494 --> 04:54.926
 Should we talk
 about
   what color ties

04:54.928 --> 04:56.561
   we're gonna wear
  so we don't clash?

04:56.563 --> 04:57.829
             Click.
            (beep)

04:57.831 --> 04:59.564
                GLORIA: Manny.

04:59.566 --> 05:02.434
      So, who is this Carly?

05:02.436 --> 05:04.236
              Carly Stevenson.
           She's my cheerleader,

05:04.238 --> 05:06.238
           but I don't think
       she's too happy about it.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.307
   What do you mean
that she's your cheerleader?

05:08.309 --> 05:09.675
    It's a football tradition.

05:09.677 --> 05:11.343
      They pair each player
       with a cheerleader,

05:11.345 --> 05:12.911
   and then they're supposed to
       decorate the
       locker,

05:12.913 --> 05:15.414
  bake them cookies, wear their
    hair the way he likes it.

05:15.416 --> 05:17.416
     It's fun for everybody.

05:17.418 --> 05:19.351
            Yesterday, all
      the other players' lockers

05:19.353 --> 05:20.619
                 looked like
              Mardi Gras floats.

05:20.621 --> 05:21.687
             My locker,
             nothing.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.288
Maybe your Carly's busy,

05:23.290 --> 05:25.424
but I'm sure she's gonna do
something nice for you.

05:25.426 --> 05:26.758
         (doorbell rings)

05:26.760 --> 05:28.960
I remember my cheerleader,
   Donna Deritzio.

05:28.962 --> 05:31.263
She got busy and did something
     nice for
     me,

05:31.265 --> 05:32.731
if you catch my meaning.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.335
    Oh! Mitchell.
You're the first to arrive.

05:36.337 --> 05:37.969
       Come on,
I'll make you a drink.

05:37.971 --> 05:40.305
             No, dad.
    I'm not here for a party.

05:40.307 --> 05:42.441
    Oh, good. I thought I forgot
     someone's birthday again.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.810
Listen, there's something
I want to talk to you about.

05:44.812 --> 05:46.611
  Um, I got an offer
  to handle a case,

05:46.613 --> 05:48.680
but I'm a little worried
 about who it's for.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.949
          What's the matter now?
             Killing whales?

05:50.951 --> 05:52.951
              Drilling for oil?
                 Child labor?

05:52.953 --> 05:54.986
                'Cause let me
             tell you
             something.

05:54.988 --> 05:56.488
           I had a paper route
         when I was 7 years
         old,

05:56.490 --> 05:57.789
                 and you know
               what it gave
               me?

05:57.791 --> 05:59.991
    A work ethic and a right arm
            like Popeye.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.560
    No, dad, it --

06:01.562 --> 06:03.895
  I'd be working for
Closets, Closets, Closets --

06:03.897 --> 06:05.030
            Next word better not
                be closets.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.498
Of course it's Closets!

06:06.500 --> 06:08.300
              Now I'm confused.

06:08.302 --> 06:09.968
  Are you talking about Closets,
    Closets, Closets, Closets,

06:09.970 --> 06:11.503
                 or Of Course
                It's Closets?

06:11.505 --> 06:12.904
             'Cause Roy
             Carson's
             a straight
             shooter,

06:12.906 --> 06:14.373
          and poor guy has a son
          who's not quite right.

06:14.375 --> 06:16.041
Are you really making me
   say this again?

06:16.043 --> 06:17.809
It's Closets, Closets --

06:17.811 --> 06:19.010
              you're not working
                   for
                   that

06:19.012 --> 06:20.579
               Rolodex-stealin
                Earl Chambers!

06:20.581 --> 06:21.813
It's just short term,
     a few
     weeks.

06:21.815 --> 06:22.714
                 You know why
              he's doing this?!

06:22.716 --> 06:24.249
Because I'm a good lawyer

06:24.251 --> 06:25.817
who handled a similar case
  for you last year.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.586
               He's doing this
               to mess with
               me!

06:27.588 --> 06:28.920
    I was referred
  by another lawyer.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.489
  I doubt Earl even
   knows about it.

06:30.491 --> 06:32.657
           That Rolodex was full
             of A-list clients.

06:32.659 --> 06:35.927
            Your Erik Estradas,
           your Fran Tarkentons,
            your Leslie Uggums.

06:35.929 --> 06:38.029
     I'm
     sorry,
are these real names?
        What about that probate?

06:38.031 --> 06:39.598
       Who did you mess that up?
       Client's dead.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.866
 Okay, this is
 crazy.

06:40.868 --> 06:43.034
   Why am I worried
 about your feelings

06:43.036 --> 06:45.771
when you obviously have
 no concern for
 mine?

06:45.773 --> 06:48.407
 Y-- (snaps fingers)
 I'm taking that
 job.

06:48.409 --> 06:49.941
            It's like a Hatfield
            working for a McCoy.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.676
If a Hatfield ever worked
     for a
     McCoy,

06:51.678 --> 06:53.845
maybe it would've ended
that ridiculous family feud.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.380
               Richard Dawson!

06:55.382 --> 06:57.416
            Also in the Rolodex!
Also in the Rolodex!

07:03.090 --> 07:04.356
       Haley, did you take
     my phone charger again?

07:04.358 --> 07:06.925
                 HALEY: What?

07:06.927 --> 07:09.461
Do you have my charger?!

07:09.463 --> 07:11.096
              I can't hear you.
                Just text me.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.697
   I wish I could!

07:12.699 --> 07:15.434
I really need you to get
your own charger, honey.

07:15.436 --> 07:16.968
   Oh, you're both
 in the bed
 together.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.603
                Dad, it's fine.
      Yeah.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.472
      Our room is your room,
      Philibuster.

07:20.474 --> 07:21.873
        Thank you, Dylan.

07:21.875 --> 07:25.610
      Uh, anyway, just, uh,
     looking for my charger.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.646
               Oh. Sorry, Dad,
                it's not here.

07:27.648 --> 07:31.716
     Guess I'll just get used
     to not having any power.

07:31.718 --> 07:33.118
          (door closes)

07:34.321 --> 07:36.455
              Carly?

07:37.658 --> 07:40.325
        Carly?

07:40.327 --> 07:41.393
             Carly?
                         Yeah?

07:41.395 --> 07:42.894
          I thought so.
Who are you?

07:42.896 --> 07:44.996
           I am Manny's
           mother,
          and I want to know why

07:44.998 --> 07:47.666
   you haven't done a better job
     at decorating his locker.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.601
Because it's a stupid
  sexist tradition.

07:49.603 --> 07:51.670
Why don't the players
decorate <i> our</i> lockers?

07:51.672 --> 07:53.972
   That's a very good question
  you should have asked yourself

07:53.974 --> 07:55.540
               before becoming
                a cheerleader.

07:56.410 --> 07:57.642
                    Here.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.411
                 Buy yourself
               something
               pretty

07:59.413 --> 08:01.913
            (angrily) and put it
            on my son's locker.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.014
         Mrs.
         Delgado-Pritchett,

08:03.016 --> 08:05.484
            may I please see you
               in my office?

08:05.486 --> 08:07.118
  Okay, I want a new cheerleader
            for Manny.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.488
      Give me this yearbook
 and I'm gonna pick one for
 him.

08:09.490 --> 08:11.490
No. Even if I did think
that was a good idea,

08:11.492 --> 08:13.825
I'm not gonna abuse my position
of power in the school.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.961
             You share an
             office
              with a tetherball.

08:15.963 --> 08:18.163
You have to just let nature
   take its course,

08:18.165 --> 08:20.966
just like this webcam
 I've been watching.

08:20.968 --> 08:23.835
  It's a live stream
   of wild otters.

08:23.837 --> 08:26.104
               I forget,
       is it the small hairy men

08:26.106 --> 08:27.839
      or the tall not hairy men?

08:27.841 --> 08:30.775
Small hairy, but these are
 actual otters.
 Look.

08:30.777 --> 08:34.513
 See, this mama
 otter
just gave birth to twins.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.481
 Now, the little
 one,
   he's struggling,

08:36.482 --> 08:38.482
    but do you see
the mama doting on him?

08:38.485 --> 08:39.951
   No, you do not.

08:39.953 --> 08:42.787
       Well, if you ask
       me,
  she's being a terrible mother.

08:42.789 --> 08:45.023
       She should be filling him
            with confidence

08:45.025 --> 08:46.825
                   and
                   fish
             like I do to
             Manny.

08:46.827 --> 08:50.629
High school is difficult.
It's part of the experience.

08:50.631 --> 08:52.664
    And that's not
     a bad
     thing.

08:52.666 --> 08:54.866
Learning how to handle
    disappointment

08:54.868 --> 08:56.468
and overcoming adversity,

08:56.470 --> 08:59.137
that's part of the reason I am
  where I am today.

09:01.141 --> 09:04.509
Chuck, no. No, no, no.
There's no more room in here.

09:04.511 --> 09:05.944
  I beg you, please!

09:06.813 --> 09:08.813
               Conference room
                is down there.

09:08.815 --> 09:09.981
    Oh, very nice.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.683
                  This is
           Mr. Chambers' office.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.652
                Oh, he's in.
           Let me introduce you.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.887
              Earl,
       am I bothering you?

09:15.889 --> 09:17.989
     Nothing's bothering me.
  I'm gonna be in <i> Time</i> magazine.

09:17.991 --> 09:19.658
<i>Closet Time.</i>
                  Shut up.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.393
     This is the attorney...
Okay. All right, all right.

09:21.395 --> 09:23.161
   ...handling the Fowler case,
           Mitchell...

09:23.163 --> 09:24.229
     Just call me Mitchell.
...Pritchett.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.997
          (stammers)
                  Pritchett?

09:25.999 --> 09:27.732
               Mitch
               Pritchett.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.668
      Son of that son of a bitch
            Jay Pritchett?

09:29.670 --> 09:33.538
       Reporting for duty.
          Don't bother unpacking
                that briefcase.

09:33.540 --> 09:36.241
       I cannot have a Pritchett
       hanging around
       here.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.710
           I got too
           much
           sensitive information

09:38.712 --> 09:41.179
            your dad would love
            to get his hands on.

09:41.181 --> 09:44.015
That was a takeout menu.
           I don't want that man
            to know where I eat.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.083
     (camera shutter clicks)

09:45.085 --> 09:46.685
          I'm just here
           to do a job.

09:46.687 --> 09:47.919
    I don't care what happened

09:47.921 --> 09:49.688
      between you and my dad
          30 years ago.

09:49.690 --> 09:52.057
              Has it really been
                  that long?

09:52.059 --> 09:54.192
        I was little when
     the whole thing started.

09:54.194 --> 09:55.961
        I used to call you
           Uncle Earl.

09:55.963 --> 09:58.930
              I remember that.
            You were a cute kid.

09:58.932 --> 10:02.133
         Hey, did you ever
         solve
            that Rubik's Cube?

10:02.135 --> 10:03.268
  I got three sides.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.036
                   Not
                   bad.

10:06.039 --> 10:08.139
                What the hell?
                You can stay.

10:08.141 --> 10:10.809
          Maybe you working here
           can be the
           beginning

10:10.811 --> 10:13.345
            of a new chapter
       between our two families.

10:13.981 --> 10:16.982
             I'll tell you
             what,
              you tell your dad

10:16.984 --> 10:19.751
if he wants to bury the hatchet,
        dinner's on me.

10:19.753 --> 10:20.819
           Oh, really?

10:20.821 --> 10:21.720
                 Absolutely.

10:21.722 --> 10:22.954
               Oh.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.889
    (camera shutter clicks)
                           Okay.

10:24.891 --> 10:27.592
  I just wish my dad
was as reasonable as you.

10:27.594 --> 10:29.094
            Thank you very much.
            Now get out of here.

10:29.096 --> 10:31.563
                 I got to get
                my cover shot.

10:31.565 --> 10:33.298
    You're not on the cover.
                        Shut up!

10:35.602 --> 10:36.968
   What are you two
     doing here?

10:36.970 --> 10:39.070
 Reaching out to a family
 member
           in distress.

10:39.072 --> 10:40.805
        You sounded pretty upset
               yesterday

10:40.807 --> 10:42.974
    So, you drove
all the way down here?

10:42.976 --> 10:44.009
   That's so sweet.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.143
        Hey, we're here for you.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.911
            How are you feeling?
                What's new?

10:46.913 --> 10:48.613
             Where's your
             friend
                 Brie's room?

10:48.615 --> 10:49.914
  Ugh. Down the hall
     to the
     left.

10:49.916 --> 10:50.915
       Just go.

10:50.917 --> 10:52.250
    Do you have a steam iron?

10:52.252 --> 10:53.652
   Because I would love to give
         this blazer a --

10:53.654 --> 10:54.953
         Ugh

10:54.955 --> 10:57.022
                 Hi, honey.
       Hey.

10:57.024 --> 11:00.091
           Sorry I'm so
           late.
        Work was so crazy today.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.593
               From the moment
                 I got there,

11:01.595 --> 11:03.194
         it was just one
         problem
              after another.

11:03.196 --> 11:04.629
           But all just
       closet stuff,
       right?

11:04.631 --> 11:06.097
     Yeah.
                      Listen.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.333
       I want to apologize about
         the whole Dylan thing.

11:08.335 --> 11:11.936
     Um...I wasn't taking your
    feelings into consideration.

11:11.938 --> 11:13.938
        I know how uncomfortable
                you are

11:13.940 --> 11:16.274
            with him sleeping
          in Haley's room, so...

11:16.276 --> 11:18.009
                  I think
           we should reconsider.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.277
       Really?

11:19.279 --> 11:22.013
               Hey. Look at
               me.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.948
      This is as much your house
            as it is mine.

11:23.950 --> 11:25.183
     I know
     that.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.786
          Let's go kick him out.

11:29.122 --> 11:31.856
            Hey, guys.
    Can we talk for a second?

11:31.858 --> 11:33.625
                      What's up?
      Actually,
   let's sit down.

11:33.627 --> 11:36.127
   There's something pretty
   important we need to discuss.

11:36.129 --> 11:37.362
   Okay, whoa.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.698
   This is exactly
   how it started out

11:39.700 --> 11:42.434
   when I found out my father
   wasn't really in space.

11:43.970 --> 11:48.239
         Anyway, um, after some
        careful consideration...

11:48.241 --> 11:49.841
             Mm-hmm.

11:49.843 --> 11:50.875
               ...your
               mother
           has something to say.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.177
              Claire, you're up.

11:52.179 --> 11:53.678
   CLAIRE: That was the moment
            I realized

11:53.680 --> 11:55.814
          Phil wanted <i> me</i>
        to kick Dylan out

11:55.816 --> 11:57.348
   so <i> he</i> could be the cool one.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.150
    Well, I can be cool, too.

11:59.152 --> 12:01.753
      I'm cooler than cool.
           I'm frigid.

12:01.755 --> 12:02.987
   Mom, what is it?

12:02.989 --> 12:04.322
         We were thinking

12:04.324 --> 12:06.825
        about having pizza
           for dinner.

12:06.827 --> 12:07.826
              Whoa!

12:07.828 --> 12:09.160
       Mm-hmm.
                    Claire.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.862
I know we had it a couple
     of days
     ago,

12:10.864 --> 12:12.197
  but I'm too tired
    to cook. Hmm.

12:12.199 --> 12:13.698
 I'm gonna go change
     my clothes.

12:13.700 --> 12:17.335
             Claire,
             um...honey.
               (clears throat)

12:17.337 --> 12:18.670
   That was weird.

12:18.672 --> 12:19.838
          You know what's weird?

12:19.840 --> 12:21.706
             Thinking your
             dad's
                 on the moon,

12:21.708 --> 12:23.808
              then seeing him
            working at the mall.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.111
Claire, what was that?

12:26.113 --> 12:27.746
I thought we were giving
   Dylan the boot.

12:27.748 --> 12:30.115
                Yeah, but then
             I suddenly
             realized

12:30.117 --> 12:31.683
            I'm being so unfair.

12:31.685 --> 12:33.418
                   You
                   like
              having Dylan here.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.853
     Yeah, but
     --

12:34.855 --> 12:36.187
              Honey, look at me.

12:36.189 --> 12:39.023
               This is as much
             your house as
             mine.

12:39.025 --> 12:42.026
    It is?
         Now go order the
         pizza.

12:42.028 --> 12:44.929
 It's getting late and those
 two
 are heading off to bed
 soon.

12:48.135 --> 12:50.068
  Oh, hey, Mitchell,
   you're in luck.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.270
There's room for another knife
     in my back.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.205
            I just came here
        to tell you to your face

12:54.207 --> 12:55.440
              that you're wrong
                 about Earl.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.775
       He is not that bad a guy.

12:56.777 --> 12:58.376
    I've seen him
  eat a panda steak.

12:58.378 --> 13:00.245
       He is a little
       rough
        around the edges,

13:00.247 --> 13:02.280
 but, look, he wants
 the rivalry to end.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.414
                    Never!

13:03.416 --> 13:04.916
      You know,
he's not the problem.

13:04.918 --> 13:06.918
    You are. You.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.953
So blinded by pettiness.

13:08.955 --> 13:11.055
You can't even see when a man's
extending an Olive branch,

13:11.057 --> 13:13.158
 and -- oh, my
 God.
                           What?

13:13.160 --> 13:15.760
       I just realized there are
       two sides to every story,

13:15.762 --> 13:17.295
              and who am I
              to discount yours?

13:17.297 --> 13:20.165
We should go inside
and we should --
        (horn honking)

13:24.304 --> 13:25.837
               You were
               saying?

13:25.839 --> 13:27.372
Nothing. I'm never saying
 anything ever
 again.

13:37.284 --> 13:38.349
                   Gloria?

13:38.351 --> 13:39.350
         No.

13:39.352 --> 13:40.852
                   Gloria.

13:40.854 --> 13:42.187
         Yes

13:42.189 --> 13:45.156
                  Streamers,
               twinkle lights.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.091
                "Sexy Manny"?

13:47.093 --> 13:49.494
      I hope there's a number
    to a good therapist in here.

13:49.496 --> 13:50.995
  I don't have time
      for this.

13:50.997 --> 13:53.765
       (gasps)

13:53.767 --> 13:54.799
    What is this?

13:54.801 --> 13:55.934
              Well, well, well.

13:55.936 --> 13:57.435
         Would you look at
         that?

13:57.437 --> 13:59.370
   I said to leave things alone,
       and what do you know?

13:59.372 --> 14:01.873
   The cheerleader came through,
        so apology accepted.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.208
     What are
     you
    talking about?

14:03.210 --> 14:04.976
     She did
     this
because I scared her.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.878
Well, whether we were both right
          or just me,

14:06.880 --> 14:09.113
           the point is things
          worked themselves out,

14:09.115 --> 14:10.982
      so I think we can go home.

14:10.984 --> 14:12.283
                  (chuckles)

14:12.285 --> 14:14.385
       (gasps)
    Carly, hello.

14:14.387 --> 14:17.555
Thank you so much for doing such
a great job on Manny's locker.

14:17.557 --> 14:18.823
                  I haven't
              decorated it yet.

14:18.825 --> 14:20.358
        What?
But then who would --

14:20.360 --> 14:23.027
    well, I guess we'll never
     (chuckling) know, so...

14:23.029 --> 14:24.996
       Cameron.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.798
           Okay, fine, I did it.

14:26.800 --> 14:29.367
What happened with letting
mother nature take its course

14:29.369 --> 14:31.169
   like the otters
  in your computer?

14:31.171 --> 14:33.738
          The little one's dead.
What?

14:33.740 --> 14:35.406
   The mother, she did nothing
 while an eagle pecked it
 apart.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.141
                Nature is cruel.
               Ah.

14:37.143 --> 14:38.743
    You decorated
   Manny's locker?

14:38.745 --> 14:40.411
      I decorated eight of them.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.380
      This tradition's on fumes.

14:43.750 --> 14:44.849
            All right.

14:44.851 --> 14:46.885
            So, this is it, huh?

14:46.887 --> 14:48.486
         The rat's nest.

14:48.488 --> 14:52.423
        Well, well, well,
        aloha, Jack Lord.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.826
          I remember you
         from my Rolodex.

14:54.828 --> 14:57.562
 I'm so embarrassed.
I can't believe I fell for it.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.330
               Well, at
               least
            you finally realized

14:59.332 --> 15:01.032
                 this is not
             some silly
             rivalry.

15:01.034 --> 15:03.434
Now let me get at his cigars
so I can drag my deal across it.

15:03.436 --> 15:04.869
            Okay, I have to say,

15:04.871 --> 15:06.404
          the Scotch is starting
               to wear off

15:06.406 --> 15:08.172
  and I'm having second thoughts
      about this plan, dad.

15:08.174 --> 15:09.340
     What's
     there
   to think about?

15:09.342 --> 15:10.541
You take a picture of me

15:10.543 --> 15:12.010
   dragging my deal
  across the cigars,

15:12.012 --> 15:13.211
we give him enough time
    to smoke them,

15:13.213 --> 15:14.445
and we send the photo
       to Earl.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.047
                First of all,
                Earl will then

15:16.049 --> 15:18.049
           have a picture of you
           with your pants down,

15:18.051 --> 15:19.517
                and I'll have
              that same picture

15:19.519 --> 15:21.386
              in my brain
        for the rest of my life.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.922
Suddenly you're squeamish about
seeing another man's deal?

15:23.924 --> 15:25.556
The man made a fool of you,
      Mitchell!

15:25.558 --> 15:26.958
               You're right.
            I'm overthinking it.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.293
                 Whip it out.

15:28.295 --> 15:30.228
  Keep your deal in your pants,
            Pritchett!

15:30.230 --> 15:31.863
            Okay, does everybody
              call it a deal?

15:31.865 --> 15:33.364
                 How have <i> I</i>
            never heard of this?

15:33.366 --> 15:35.266
 You've gone too far
   this time, Earl.

15:35.268 --> 15:36.935
  Bringing my family
      into this.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.970
       Yeah. How could
       you?
          I trusted you.

15:38.972 --> 15:40.872
          I defended you
          to my father,

15:40.874 --> 15:42.974
         and you made me
        look like a fool!

15:42.976 --> 15:45.576
        And all for what?
             Closets.

15:45.578 --> 15:48.046
  You mean the place
that people start each day,

15:48.048 --> 15:49.580
  choosing an outfit
   that gives them

15:49.582 --> 15:51.549
the confidence to achieve
    their dreams?

15:51.551 --> 15:54.552
          Or that magical space
         that turns a bonus
         room

15:54.554 --> 15:57.288
             into a bedroom
        and a house into a home?

15:57.290 --> 15:58.890
Thanks to cheap materials,

15:58.892 --> 16:01.225
your closets turn a house
  into a fire trap!

16:01.227 --> 16:02.393
          We pleaded no contest.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.395
        That is not an admission
               of guilt.

16:04.397 --> 16:05.563
    I'm doing it.
I'm taking my deal out.

16:05.565 --> 16:08.066
              The hell you are!
                  Get! Get!

16:08.068 --> 16:10.335
         (both grunting)

16:10.337 --> 16:13.137
I'll crush your skull
     like an
     egg!

16:13.139 --> 16:15.006
          (both yelling)

16:15.008 --> 16:17.075
         And they say by the
         end
             of the semester,

16:17.077 --> 16:19.077
               we'll know
               how
           to sequence a genome.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.079
                 I don't know
                about genomes,

16:21.081 --> 16:23.581
         but on my father's
         side
              of the family,

16:23.583 --> 16:25.350
      we do have a garden gnome.

16:25.352 --> 16:27.285
              He uses a mushroom
               as an umbrella.

16:27.287 --> 16:28.353
                  (chuckles)

16:29.622 --> 16:31.255
              Manny, you're up.

16:31.257 --> 16:33.358
          Can I just say
         it's so amazing

16:33.360 --> 16:35.159
        spending some time
          with you two.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.595
           I am so sick
         of superficial,

16:37.597 --> 16:40.031
          self-absorbed
        high-school girls.

16:40.033 --> 16:42.467
           Oh, my God,
    I <i> hated</i> high-school girls.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.035
      The worst
  are cheerleaders.

16:44.037 --> 16:46.437
They used to make fun of me
behind my back brace.

16:46.439 --> 16:49.374
                 Well,
       <i> brace</i> yourself for
       this.

16:49.376 --> 16:51.676
              You look hot now.

16:52.946 --> 16:54.212
              Manny, you're up.

16:54.214 --> 16:55.646
        Forgive my friend.

16:55.648 --> 16:58.016
      It's just that you two
        are so beautiful,

16:58.018 --> 16:59.350
   it's a little intimidating.

17:01.454 --> 17:03.121
                    Okay.

17:03.123 --> 17:04.955
             College isn't
             going
             the way we
             thought.

17:04.958 --> 17:06.958
  Neither of us has kissed a guy
        since we got here.

17:06.960 --> 17:09.193
                    So...

17:09.194 --> 17:10.127
     You mean
     us?

17:10.130 --> 17:11.628
                    Yeah.
   Now?

17:11.631 --> 17:13.631
   In accordance
   with campus regulations,

17:13.633 --> 17:14.965
   you have our consent.

17:14.968 --> 17:16.233
   Yes!

17:16.236 --> 17:18.536
                  Thank you.
             I'll be right
             back.

17:20.473 --> 17:21.571
           (door opens)

17:21.574 --> 17:23.540
          Gum, gum, gum.
           I need gum.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.242
  I don't have any.

17:30.150 --> 17:33.151
   (gasps) Thanks.

17:33.153 --> 17:34.719
      I finally got through
            to Sanjay.

17:38.158 --> 17:40.925
Um...sounds personal.

17:40.927 --> 17:42.660
I don't want to stick my nose
     into your
     --

17:42.662 --> 17:44.462
            He broke up with me.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.665
       He's seeing someone else.

17:47.667 --> 17:52.537
Um, you probably want to be
   alone right now.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.272
         (voice breaking)
           I <i> am</i> alone.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.508
                   (sighs)

17:57.510 --> 17:59.410
                     Hey.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.611
                   Come
                   on.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.613
               You'll be okay.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.382
     (sniffling)

18:04.384 --> 18:06.951
                That's, uh...

18:06.953 --> 18:08.686
        That's really all I got.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.054
           (door opens)

18:10.056 --> 18:11.355
               Luke, hurry up.

18:11.357 --> 18:12.523
        They're starting to come
            to their senses.

18:12.525 --> 18:14.425
    Go. It's fine.

18:19.399 --> 18:21.566
I'm gonna stay with Alex.

18:21.568 --> 18:24.302
              Is there anything
                  I can do?

18:24.304 --> 18:25.703
        I don't think so.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.371
              Okay, pray for me.

18:30.643 --> 18:32.143
            Well, there you are.

18:32.145 --> 18:34.579
           Didn't quite work out
              like we planned,

18:34.581 --> 18:36.781
       but I did get that staple
              in his head.

18:36.783 --> 18:39.117
You have to understand I did it
for the right reasons.

18:39.119 --> 18:40.718
I was -- I was just looking out
    for my family,

18:40.720 --> 18:43.154
        but...
you're my family, too.

18:43.156 --> 18:44.722
     You know what the best
     part
           of tonight was?

18:45.592 --> 18:47.792
                It wasn't just
               <i> me</i> against
               Earl.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.660
          It was <i> us</i> against him.

18:49.662 --> 18:50.728
                I liked that.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.563
   I did too. Yeah.

18:52.565 --> 18:56.467
And I promise I will <i> never</i> side
with anyone else ever again.

18:56.469 --> 18:57.802
  Unless, of course,
    you're wrong,

18:57.804 --> 18:59.570
'cause I still do have
    my principles.

18:59.572 --> 19:00.771
              (chuckling) okay.

19:00.773 --> 19:02.240
        Just get out of the car.

19:02.242 --> 19:05.576
     First I
     have
  to give you <i> this.</i>

19:05.578 --> 19:07.612
            It's my old Rolodex!
  Yeah.

19:07.614 --> 19:09.147
  I stole it
  out of his office.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.448
                But how? When?

19:10.450 --> 19:12.250
You guys were rolling around
under that desk

19:12.252 --> 19:13.651
for about 10 minutes.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.253
After I grabbed it, I had time
to return some e-mails.

19:15.255 --> 19:17.255
             Thank you for
             this.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.689
              It's a huge deal.

19:18.691 --> 19:22.593
That word's kind of tainted
  for me now, so...

19:22.595 --> 19:24.095
               (both giggling)

19:24.097 --> 19:25.463
    You guys cold?
I can turn up the heat,

19:25.465 --> 19:27.131
get you out from underneath
    that blanket.

19:27.133 --> 19:28.299
            We're good, L.A.P.D.

19:28.301 --> 19:29.834
(chuckles)
           (laughs)

19:29.836 --> 19:33.271
  As bad as I wanted Dylan out,
      I wasn't gonna flinch.

19:33.273 --> 19:34.772
      Phil needed to do it.

19:34.774 --> 19:37.475
     He needed to be as tough
  as that eagle on the Internet.

19:37.477 --> 19:40.444
 Dumb otter never saw it
 coming.

19:40.446 --> 19:42.446
                  Oh, stop!
                That tickles!

19:42.448 --> 19:43.381
               Uh!

19:43.383 --> 19:44.482
 You all right,
 Phil?

19:44.484 --> 19:45.783
              Yeah,
     just enjoying the movie.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.652
                Oh, you are?
            It's not even scary.

19:47.654 --> 19:50.388
       Like, that is the
       lamest
     sea monster I've ever
     seen.

19:50.390 --> 19:52.456
    That's 'cause
   you can see it.

19:52.458 --> 19:55.226
  It is way scarier
if you can only imagine

19:55.228 --> 19:57.562
   what's going on
 beneath the
 surface.

19:57.564 --> 19:58.796
              (laughing) Aah!
That's it!

19:58.798 --> 20:00.131
I'm done!
                Oh!

20:00.133 --> 20:01.399
          Haley, Dylan,

20:01.401 --> 20:02.800
  this little living arrangement
            of yours,

20:02.802 --> 20:05.303
       it's not working
       out
    and it's about to change.

20:05.305 --> 20:07.705
Dad, why are you
 freaking out?
     Because I'm your father

20:07.707 --> 20:09.407
 and I can't have the two of
 you
 sleeping together

20:09.409 --> 20:11.842
     in the same
     room
     like it's no big deal.

20:11.844 --> 20:14.478
   So, from now on, you're gonna
   show me the respect I deserve

20:14.480 --> 20:15.846
     and sneak
     around
     behind my back.

20:15.848 --> 20:17.215
    Do what, now?

20:17.217 --> 20:19.183
I don't understand.
        Starting tonight,

20:19.185 --> 20:20.418
         you're sleeping
         in Alex's room,

20:20.420 --> 20:21.819
        and if there's any
         monkey business,

20:21.821 --> 20:23.221
          better happen
        after I'm asleep.

20:23.223 --> 20:24.488
  Are you serious?!

20:24.490 --> 20:26.324
 I'm okay with that.
                         Me
                         too.

20:26.326 --> 20:27.558
         I'm not okay with
         that.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.393
               I'm not
               okay
               with any of that.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.829
        Haley, you need to start
        focusing on your job.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.831
     Dylan
     you're moving out
     tomorrow.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.766
              End of discussion!

20:35.768 --> 20:37.835
           Sorry.
           I'm not the cool mom.

20:37.837 --> 20:39.904
             CLAIRE:
        <i> Not</i> the cool mom.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.740
 Hey, guys, I tried.
      (chuckles)

20:42.742 --> 20:44.542
       (sighs)

20:44.544 --> 20:45.509
       Thanks.

What are you doing
in my bed?!

     Sanjay broke up with me.
