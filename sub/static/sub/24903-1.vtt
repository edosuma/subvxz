00:30.663 --> 00:32.329
The documentary
you're about to see

00:32.331 --> 00:35.865
is based on an incredible
true story.

00:35.867 --> 00:39.302
Some have said it's more
incredible than true,

00:39.304 --> 00:40.404
and,
to tell the truth,

00:40.406 --> 00:42.204
that may or may not
be true.

00:42.206 --> 00:44.774
But, while not all
of it may be,

00:44.776 --> 00:47.810
or may not be, true,
most of it is.

00:47.812 --> 00:50.680
Oh, okay, "most" might be
an exaggeration.

00:50.682 --> 00:53.249
Let's just say that
a great deal

00:53.251 --> 00:56.386
of this incredible
true story is true.

00:56.388 --> 00:58.188
How much
is hard to say.

00:58.190 --> 01:00.023
A number of the events
that happened,

01:00.025 --> 01:01.424
or might
have happened,

01:01.426 --> 01:04.093
in, uh, this
incredibly true story

01:04.096 --> 01:05.461
certainly
could have happened,

01:05.462 --> 01:08.098
and they may have.

01:08.100 --> 01:09.532
We just
can't prove it.

01:09.534 --> 01:11.300
However,
one thing's for sure.

01:11.302 --> 01:12.969
While the events
in this incredible true story

01:12.971 --> 01:15.505
may or may not have
happened as shown here

01:15.507 --> 01:17.473
in this incredible
true story,

01:17.475 --> 01:19.109
there are definitely
several elements

01:19.111 --> 01:21.178
in this incredible
true story

01:21.180 --> 01:23.747
that have
definitely happened.

01:23.749 --> 01:25.414
Somewhere.

01:25.416 --> 01:28.217
To someone at
one time or another.

01:28.219 --> 01:31.020
Therefore, it is
with great pride

01:31.022 --> 01:32.288
that the producers...

01:32.290 --> 01:34.458
not all of them,
but some of them...

01:34.460 --> 01:36.193
well, at least one
of them...

01:36.195 --> 01:37.660
is, or are, proud

01:37.662 --> 01:39.729
to present the
following incredible

01:39.731 --> 01:42.834
and quite possibly
true story.

01:46.972 --> 01:49.842
♪ ♪

01:56.347 --> 01:59.383
I'm Steve Schmidt for ANC News

01:59.385 --> 02:01.151
on the campus
of Lawrence University

02:01.153 --> 02:03.185
in beautiful
Appleton, Wisconsin.

02:03.187 --> 02:04.755
This is where everything began

02:04.757 --> 02:08.190
for Appleton's own
Bucky and the Squirrels,

02:08.192 --> 02:09.860
the one-hit-wonder rock group,
who,

02:09.862 --> 02:11.895
<i>back in the 1960s,
skyrocketed to the top</i>

02:11.897 --> 02:14.931
<i>with their number-one dance
hit, "Do the Squirrel."</i>

02:14.933 --> 02:17.867
Tragically,
in the winter of 1968,

02:17.869 --> 02:20.504
while on their maiden
European promotional tour,

02:20.506 --> 02:22.973
the chartered plane that
carried Bucky and the Squirrels

02:22.975 --> 02:27.343
<i>vanished, never to be seen
or heard from again.</i>

02:27.345 --> 02:29.646
That is, until today.

02:29.648 --> 02:32.516
Here, live from Switzerland,
is Mitchell Friedman

02:32.518 --> 02:34.683
with more
on this developing story.

02:34.685 --> 02:35.754
Mitchell?

02:38.990 --> 02:40.157
Uh, thank you, Steve.

02:40.159 --> 02:41.591
As you can see, or maybe not,

02:41.593 --> 02:43.392
I'm here in the middle
of a raging blizzard

02:43.394 --> 02:46.796
six kilometers north
of the famed Zermatt ski resort,

02:46.798 --> 02:48.765
where, only hours ago,
the storm uncovered

02:48.767 --> 02:51.034
what has just been
positively identified

02:51.036 --> 02:53.536
as the remains of the plane
that took the lives

02:53.538 --> 02:56.105
of the American rock group Bucky and
the Squirrels.

02:56.107 --> 02:58.808
I... I apologize
about the noise.

02:58.810 --> 03:01.945
What you hear in the background
is snow removal equipment

03:01.947 --> 03:04.880
working to free
the partially buried wreckage,

03:04.882 --> 03:07.117
which, as I understand,
remarkably,

03:07.119 --> 03:09.952
is in near pristine condition.

03:13.357 --> 03:14.857
Okay, thank you, Mitchell.

03:14.859 --> 03:17.660
For Bucky and the Squirrels,
it all began here

03:17.662 --> 03:20.198
in beautiful
Appleton, Wisconsin.

03:30.675 --> 03:33.109
Appleton, Wisconsin,
is located here,

03:33.111 --> 03:34.846
<i>in Appleton, Wisconsin.</i>

03:36.248 --> 03:38.748
<i>Before the Squirrels
were alive,</i>

03:38.750 --> 03:42.952
<i>Appleton was known for three
really awesome things:</i>

03:42.954 --> 03:44.454
<i>Lawrence University,</i>

03:44.456 --> 03:46.490
<i>the second-oldest
co-educational</i>

03:46.492 --> 03:48.524
<i>boys and girls college</i>

03:48.526 --> 03:50.226
<i>in the United States
of America,</i>

03:50.228 --> 03:51.994
<i>and for being
the hometown</i>

03:51.996 --> 03:54.797
<i>of writer Edna Ferber</i>

03:54.799 --> 03:57.534
<i>and escape
artist Houdini.</i>

03:57.536 --> 04:00.670
<i>Houdini is the man
on the right.</i>

04:00.672 --> 04:04.140
<i>Edna Ferber, or "Edna"
as her friends called her,</i>

04:04.142 --> 04:06.141
<i>was a short story writer.</i>

04:06.143 --> 04:09.546
<i>Edna wasn't short,
her stories were.</i>

04:09.548 --> 04:12.182
<i>Except, of course,
for the ones that were long.</i>

04:12.184 --> 04:15.184
<i>Anyway, in 1968,</i>

04:15.186 --> 04:17.988
<i>all that changed about
what Appleton was famous for</i>

04:17.990 --> 04:21.358
<i>when the Squirrels had
an awesome dance hit.</i>

04:21.360 --> 04:25.027
<i>The Squirrels were
Phillip Westerbrook,</i>

04:25.029 --> 04:27.029
<i>Randy Cunningham,</i>

04:27.031 --> 04:28.464
<i>Douglas Wilson,</i>

04:28.466 --> 04:30.567
<i>and Thomas
"Bucky" Fuller.</i>

04:30.569 --> 04:32.935
<i>And they became
childhood friends</i>

04:32.937 --> 04:34.404
<i>when they were children.</i>

04:34.406 --> 04:35.942
<i>Here's a picture of them
back then.</i>

04:37.976 --> 04:40.043
<i>Over the years,
they grew older.</i>

04:40.045 --> 04:41.710
<i>And in addition</i>

04:41.712 --> 04:44.080
<i>to the many awesome things
they had in common...</i>

04:44.082 --> 04:47.851
<i>like being friends and like
being from Appleton</i>

04:47.853 --> 04:50.185
<i>and being in high school
together and stuff...</i>

04:50.187 --> 04:53.690
<i>they shared a love
of rock-and-roll music</i>

04:53.692 --> 04:55.859
<i>and formed
a rock-and-roll band.</i>

04:55.861 --> 05:00.597
They decided to call the band
the Appletones, so they did.

05:00.599 --> 05:03.133
<i>They played locally
at local clubs.</i>

05:03.135 --> 05:04.801
<i>But they were so bad</i>

05:04.803 --> 05:07.404
<i>that they not only
had to play for free,</i>

05:07.406 --> 05:10.272
<i>they even had to pay
to get in, too,</i>

05:10.274 --> 05:11.710
<i>which really sucked.</i>

05:13.211 --> 05:14.911
<i>After a couple of years,</i>

05:14.913 --> 05:18.013
<i>suddenly they met a talent
agent named Mort Fishbeck,</i>

05:18.015 --> 05:20.483
<i>who was a talent agent.</i>

05:20.485 --> 05:24.820
Because many successful bands
<i>back then had animal names,</i>

05:24.822 --> 05:25.858
<i>such as...</i>

05:32.063 --> 05:35.431
<i>...Mort changed their name
from the Appletones</i>

05:35.433 --> 05:37.334
<i>to the Squirrels.</i>

05:37.336 --> 05:38.969
<i>Then they wrote
"Do the Squirrel,"</i>

05:38.971 --> 05:42.539
<i>which was an original song
they wrote themselves.</i>

05:42.541 --> 05:44.541
<i>They probably would have
written some more,</i>

05:44.543 --> 05:46.712
<i>but they couldn't
because they died first.</i>

05:48.245 --> 05:49.378
<i>A big thanks</i>

05:49.380 --> 05:50.347
<i>to Harvey Weinstein,</i>

05:50.349 --> 05:51.414
<i>whose father does videos</i>

05:51.416 --> 05:52.481
<i>for weddings</i>

05:52.483 --> 05:53.984
<i>and Jewish bar mitzvahs,</i>

05:53.986 --> 05:55.217
<i>who helped me</i>

05:55.219 --> 05:56.519
<i>put this thing together.</i>

<i>a waitress said
one of the Squirrels, Phil,</i>

<i>Nobody could remember.</i>

<i>So Phil married her.</i>

07:17.002 --> 07:21.738
Here's the wedding invitation
<i>they used to invite people.</i>

07:21.740 --> 07:23.940
<i>Once that was over,
Mort got the Squirrels</i>

07:23.942 --> 07:27.510
on a local TV teen dance show
<i>in Appleton,</i>

07:27.512 --> 07:29.979
<i>hosted by host
Dave Madden.</i>

07:31.416 --> 07:33.116
Let's hear it for
our guests today,

07:33.118 --> 07:34.750
Bucky and the Squirrels.

07:36.288 --> 07:38.955
No offense, but how the heck
do you talk with these things?

07:38.957 --> 07:42.224
Uh, those are fake
and these are real.

07:42.226 --> 07:44.760
Good point. Now, which one
of you is Bucky?

07:44.762 --> 07:46.128
Only kidding.

07:46.130 --> 07:48.664
Bucky, how about introducing
the rest of the band?

07:48.666 --> 07:50.734
Oh, sure.
Phil, this is Randy.

07:50.736 --> 07:53.969
Randy, this is Phil.
Doug, Randy, Phil.

07:53.971 --> 07:55.671
Nice to meet you, Randy.

07:55.673 --> 07:58.875
If you don't mind, I'd like
to ask you a question.

07:58.877 --> 08:03.279
Now, many groups, bands...
groups, if you will...

08:03.281 --> 08:05.948
have members who are
related to each other.

08:05.950 --> 08:08.150
Brothers, sisters, cousins.

08:08.152 --> 08:09.753
Are any of you related?

08:09.755 --> 08:11.320
No.

08:11.322 --> 08:13.623
Okay.

08:13.625 --> 08:15.625
I understand one of you
just got married.

08:15.627 --> 08:18.227
Which one of you is Phil?

08:19.397 --> 08:20.630
That's me.

08:20.632 --> 08:23.399
Oh! So who's
the unlucky girl?

08:23.401 --> 08:25.704
Only kidding.
Who's the lucky girl?

08:26.872 --> 08:29.371
Ah, don't be shy.
Tell us all about it.

08:29.373 --> 08:32.375
Well, not all about it,
because we are on TV.

08:32.376 --> 08:33.976
Let's start with how
you met.

08:33.977 --> 08:35.879
It's a very long story, so...

08:35.881 --> 08:38.280
probably don't have enough time,
we should probably skip that...

08:38.282 --> 08:39.881
He knocked up a waitress.

08:39.884 --> 08:41.451
...a little bit.

08:41.453 --> 08:43.789
I wonder why.
Tell us.

08:45.656 --> 08:47.425
So, um...

08:48.993 --> 08:50.526
So, uh...

08:50.528 --> 08:53.328
Oh, how about favoring us
with a performance, Rocky?

08:53.330 --> 08:55.265
It's, uh, Bucky.

08:55.267 --> 08:57.534
Uh, right, um,
I was confusing you

08:57.536 --> 08:59.535
with Rocky
the Flying Squirrel.

08:59.537 --> 09:01.004
You know,
Rocky and Bullwinkle?

09:01.006 --> 09:04.240
"Hey, you wanna see me pull
a rabbit out of my hat?"

09:04.242 --> 09:05.674
That's Bullwinkle.

09:05.676 --> 09:07.843
Um, I believe it's Rocky.

09:07.845 --> 09:09.913
- No, it's Bullwinkle.
- It's Bullwinkle.

09:09.915 --> 09:11.581
Okay, fine, it's Bullwinkle.

09:11.583 --> 09:13.716
I'm sure a lot of people
confuse the two, so...

09:13.718 --> 09:14.851
I don't.

09:14.853 --> 09:16.986
No, one's a very tall moose,
one's a small...

09:16.988 --> 09:19.489
Fine, great, everybody,
Rocky and the Squirrels!

09:19.491 --> 09:21.991
It's Bucky, actually.

never completed
their ill-fated tour.

11:40.699 --> 11:44.232
With more on the story,
live from downtown Appleton,

11:44.234 --> 11:47.636
here's Barbara Harris.
Barbara?

11:47.638 --> 11:49.404
Barbara Harris here
in front of Squirrel Mania,

11:49.406 --> 11:52.574
a combination local retail
and local shrine

11:52.576 --> 11:54.242
to Bucky and the Squirrels.

11:54.244 --> 11:55.510
Let's look inside.

to get an interview

12:03.054 --> 12:06.356
with Mort Fishbeck,
the manager of the Squirrels.

12:07.358 --> 12:08.457
Mr. Fishbeck.

12:08.459 --> 12:10.326

You scared the hell out of me.

12:19.103 --> 12:20.470
I'm sorry.

12:20.472 --> 12:22.538
You're sorry?
I practically wet myself.

12:22.540 --> 12:24.106
You could have just
walked up and said,

12:24.108 --> 12:25.607
"Excuse me,
Mr. Fishbeck."

12:25.609 --> 12:26.842
I did.

12:26.844 --> 12:28.745
Oh. So, what can I
do for you?

12:28.747 --> 12:31.347
Would you mind turning
the music down?

12:31.349 --> 12:33.216
Would you mind if I
turned the music down?

But I guess if it isn't loud,
it isn't rock-and-roll, is it?

12:41.459 --> 12:42.658
Should have worn earplugs.

12:42.660 --> 12:44.796
Reminds me, hang on a second.

12:47.297 --> 12:48.798
Squirrel earplugs.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.399
See? They're shaped
like peanuts, get it?

12:50.401 --> 12:52.668
Squirrels, peanuts?

12:52.670 --> 12:53.836
Maybe later.

12:53.838 --> 12:55.004

12:55.006 --> 12:56.405
Maybe later.

12:56.407 --> 12:58.040
Mr. Fishbeck,
I'm sure you know

12:58.042 --> 12:59.875
that the plane that was
carrying the Squirrels

12:59.877 --> 13:01.077
was just found.

13:01.079 --> 13:02.477
Yeah, it breaks my heart.

13:02.479 --> 13:03.712
The thought of those kids

13:03.714 --> 13:06.948
frozen for 50 years
like Popsicles.

13:06.950 --> 13:09.452
You know, if you don't count my
brothers, Sid and Marty,

13:09.454 --> 13:11.721
those boys were
the brothers I never had.

13:11.723 --> 13:13.688
I was supposed to be
on the next plane.

13:13.690 --> 13:15.223
I still have
all their instruments.

13:15.225 --> 13:17.860
Got their clothes upstairs.
That's all I've got left.

13:17.862 --> 13:21.063
Can you tell us about the first
time you heard the Squirrels?

13:21.065 --> 13:22.365
Oh, awful.

13:22.367 --> 13:23.899
Beyond awful.

13:23.901 --> 13:26.968
Every song, note for note,
right off the sheet music.

13:26.970 --> 13:28.804
It was like being trapped
in an elevator.

13:28.806 --> 13:30.606
And it is my understanding
that in those days,

13:30.608 --> 13:31.908
Bucky was
in the background.

13:31.910 --> 13:34.276
Oh, he was so far
in the background,

13:34.278 --> 13:35.645
he was in
a different zip code.

13:35.647 --> 13:37.579
He was embarrassed because
of his buck teeth.

13:37.581 --> 13:40.149
Could open up
a pop bottle with 'em.

13:40.151 --> 13:41.083
Pop!

13:41.085 --> 13:42.717
I said to him, "Shmuck!

13:42.719 --> 13:44.287
Being different is
a good thing.

13:44.289 --> 13:45.487
It makes you sound
different."

13:45.489 --> 13:46.755
I said to him,
"You don't want to end up

13:46.757 --> 13:48.658
like the Barlow Brothers,
do you?"

13:48.660 --> 13:49.725
Who?

13:49.727 --> 13:51.994
I rest my case.

13:51.996 --> 13:54.730
Oh, and now we go to Steve
Schmidt for a news bulletin.

13:54.732 --> 13:58.101
Barbara, I'm sorry to interrupt
this incredible interview,

13:58.103 --> 14:00.535
but we've just received
an update from the crash site.

14:00.537 --> 14:03.005
Here's Mitchell again
with that report.

14:03.007 --> 14:04.376
Mitchell?

14:09.280 --> 14:11.380
Steve, uh, hold on.

14:11.382 --> 14:13.949
The construction crew has just
dug the plane

14:13.951 --> 14:15.284
out of the frozen tundra

14:15.286 --> 14:17.520
and is prying
the cockpit doors open.

14:17.522 --> 14:19.554
My God, I don't believe it.

14:19.556 --> 14:22.257
Bucky and the Squirrels are
encased in ice in the cockpit,

14:22.259 --> 14:25.895
and from what it looks like...
yes, this is really scary...

14:25.897 --> 14:27.663
they're perfectly preserved
like mummies.

14:27.665 --> 14:29.265
There's a lot of confusion

14:29.267 --> 14:31.299
as paramedics have joined
the workers

14:31.301 --> 14:33.803
and they're descending
on the crash site.

14:33.805 --> 14:37.743
I'm not quite sure
what's going on.

14:38.910 --> 14:41.177
While we wait on that update,
here's a sidebar.

14:41.179 --> 14:42.712
British pilot Frank Fowler,

14:42.714 --> 14:45.448
the captain that flew
the small chartered plane

14:45.450 --> 14:46.848
carrying the Squirrels
to their concert,

14:46.850 --> 14:49.385
panicked and parachuted
out of the plane.

14:49.387 --> 14:50.752
He was discovered days later

14:50.754 --> 14:53.956
by the monks at the monastery
of St. Benedict.

14:53.958 --> 14:57.425
Out of a great sense of guilt,
Frank Fowler joined the order,

14:57.427 --> 14:59.395
took the sacred vow of silence,

14:59.397 --> 15:01.197
and has not spoken a word

15:01.199 --> 15:02.798
for over 45 years.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.066
Oh, just a minute.

15:04.068 --> 15:06.769
I believe we have an update
from Mitchell.

15:06.771 --> 15:08.236
Mitchell?

15:10.708 --> 15:12.107
Th-that's correct, Steve.

15:12.109 --> 15:15.544
Experts in the field of cryonics
have just been contacted

15:15.546 --> 15:17.813
and are unanimous
in their assessment.

15:17.815 --> 15:20.816
If it is at all possible
to revive any of the Squirrels,

15:20.818 --> 15:23.818
the shock of their awakening
in unfamiliar surroundings

15:23.820 --> 15:26.188
could cause
irreparable psychic damage.

15:26.190 --> 15:29.192
Consequently, it was decided
that they be airlifted

15:29.194 --> 15:31.526
back to a facility
in their hometown

15:31.528 --> 15:33.828
of Appleton, Wisconsin.

15:33.830 --> 15:35.398
Uh, what you hear
in the background

15:35.400 --> 15:36.731
is the arrival of four

15:36.733 --> 15:40.937
CH-47F Chinook cargo
evac helicopters.

15:40.939 --> 15:45.408
The ground crew has loaded
the entombed frozen bodies

15:45.410 --> 15:48.077
into the aircrafts
and they've taken off,

15:48.079 --> 15:49.712
a sight I'm sure

15:49.714 --> 15:52.014
many of your viewers
will never forget.

15:54.551 --> 15:57.419
Here in Appleton Cryonics,
we're fortunate in having

15:57.421 --> 15:58.853
some of the world's

15:58.855 --> 16:01.890
most sophisticated
defrosting equipment.

16:07.297 --> 16:08.898
Ice-cold.

16:08.900 --> 16:10.799
But what's the surprise?

16:10.801 --> 16:13.903
Everything in this place
is ice-cold.

16:13.905 --> 16:15.605
I'm here with
Dr. Albert Fisher,

16:15.607 --> 16:17.405
director of
Appleton Cryonics.

16:17.407 --> 16:18.941
I'm sorry, doctor,
you were saying?

16:18.943 --> 16:20.342
Uh... Oh, right.

16:20.344 --> 16:22.812
The equipment here is
the finest anywhere.

16:22.814 --> 16:26.148
Although, I must admit,
until, uh, now,

16:26.150 --> 16:28.250
we haven't had
the opportunity

16:28.252 --> 16:30.354
to actually try
any of it out.

16:31.589 --> 16:33.322
And I just want
to make clear

16:33.324 --> 16:35.890
that we did not
freeze the Squirrels.

16:35.892 --> 16:38.093
If they don't,
you know, pull through

16:38.095 --> 16:40.295
or end up taking
a dirt nap,

16:40.297 --> 16:42.198
well,
we're not responsible.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.199
I'm sorry,
do you mind my asking

16:44.201 --> 16:45.768
what your
specialty is?

16:45.770 --> 16:47.803
Oh, I don't think
that's important.

16:47.805 --> 16:50.106
Well, I think our viewers would
probably like to know.

16:50.108 --> 16:53.842
Uh, well, I'm not
an actual medical doctor.

16:53.844 --> 16:55.711
Okay, then your
training is in...?

16:55.713 --> 16:56.946
Something else.

16:56.948 --> 16:58.914
And that would be...?

16:58.916 --> 17:00.982
Uh...

17:00.984 --> 17:01.954
motel management.

17:03.621 --> 17:05.454
Really? Because I would
have thought it would be...

17:05.455 --> 17:08.056
No, it's okay, a lot
of people make that mistake.

17:08.058 --> 17:09.228
Yeah.

17:10.295 --> 17:13.028
So, what is going on
in here?

17:13.030 --> 17:14.865
Uh, uh, research.

17:17.000 --> 17:17.967
On?

17:17.969 --> 17:20.468
You know, scientific stuff.

17:20.470 --> 17:22.037
I try not to get involved.

17:22.039 --> 17:23.738
Uh, here, follow me.

17:23.740 --> 17:26.742
Dr. Winston, you're
wanted in Preservation Lab.

17:26.743 --> 17:29.715
<i>Dr. Winston, you're wanted
in Preservation Lab.</i>

17:30.981 --> 17:33.349
<i>Anyone in the vicinity
of the Bio Lab,</i>

17:33.351 --> 17:35.184
please report to assistance.

17:35.186 --> 17:38.290
Oh. One second.

17:39.891 --> 17:41.690
Hmm.

17:41.692 --> 17:43.461
Hah! Hmm.

17:45.896 --> 17:48.663
Wait, that's what you call it,
"defrosting"?

17:48.665 --> 17:51.202
When you come up with a better
name, let me know.

17:52.769 --> 17:55.338
Oh, doctor, I've never seen
such elaborate equipment.

17:55.340 --> 17:56.604
So...

17:56.606 --> 17:58.740
what is this large,
complex-looking

17:58.742 --> 18:00.508
electronic system
in the corner?

18:00.510 --> 18:01.910
Oh, that's
our sound system.

18:01.912 --> 18:04.813
When we're not using the
equipment to defrost people,

18:04.815 --> 18:07.350
the room doubles
as a tanning salon.

18:07.352 --> 18:10.018
I can't believe what's happening
here! You must come and see!

18:10.020 --> 18:12.354
- Tissue regeneration...
- The vitals aren't normal.

18:12.356 --> 18:13.621
Well, I'll be damned.

18:15.727 --> 18:18.393
L-ladies and gentlemen,
what you are witnessing

18:18.395 --> 18:20.129
is truly
groundbreaking.

18:20.131 --> 18:21.930
This is
a scientific first!

18:22.933 --> 18:24.300
Whoa, what's that?

18:24.302 --> 18:25.200
Oh, that's lunch.

18:25.202 --> 18:27.069
What's today, Wednesday?

18:27.071 --> 18:29.304
Ugh! Split pea soup.
Ugggh!

18:34.511 --> 18:36.579
I'm here in the recovery room
of Appleton Cryonics,

18:36.581 --> 18:38.647
where, miraculously,
all four of the Squirrels

18:38.649 --> 18:40.682
were resuscitated two days ago.

18:40.684 --> 18:43.518
Appleton Cryonics has given us
permission to film here

18:43.520 --> 18:47.089
and record the event
while they document the recovery

18:47.091 --> 18:50.159
of the Squirrels, for research
and insurance purposes.

18:50.161 --> 18:52.331
Let's go to the Squirrels.

18:56.968 --> 18:58.133
Good morning!

18:58.135 --> 19:00.002
Good morning.

19:00.004 --> 19:01.137
Good morning.

19:02.640 --> 19:04.273
Good morning.
Can you say good morning?

19:06.110 --> 19:08.043
This is Dr. Adams.

19:08.045 --> 19:10.545
She's our staff
psychologist.

19:12.650 --> 19:16.485
I will leave you
in her capable hands.

19:16.487 --> 19:17.553
Don't leave me.

19:17.555 --> 19:19.121
No, it's okay.
You'll be fine.

19:20.223 --> 19:21.256
Okay.

19:24.629 --> 19:28.163
We all have
a lot of work to do.

19:28.165 --> 19:30.064
You're going
to have to learn...

19:30.066 --> 19:33.436
or rather relearn...
to eat,

19:33.438 --> 19:37.672
to talk, to walk.

19:42.712 --> 19:43.646
So...

19:58.528 --> 20:01.663
Back in the '60s, the Squirrels

20:01.665 --> 20:04.702
were unquestionably the most
talented rock group ever.

20:05.670 --> 20:07.870
Of course, next to the Beatles.

20:07.872 --> 20:09.737
Which would naturally
make the Squirrels

20:09.739 --> 20:13.775
the second most talented
rock group ever.

20:13.777 --> 20:15.444
Sorry, I take that back,

20:15.446 --> 20:18.246
the Rolling Stones
were around in the '60s.

20:18.248 --> 20:19.648
Which would make the Squirrels

20:19.650 --> 20:23.052
the third most talented
rock group ever.

20:23.054 --> 20:27.656
The Beatles, the Rolling Stones,
and the Squirrels.

20:27.658 --> 20:30.926
Then again, who can forget
the Beach Boys?

20:30.928 --> 20:32.894
Apparently, I did,
and I'm not gonna do that.

20:32.896 --> 20:35.898
Because when I think about it,
I also forgot the Kinks,

20:35.900 --> 20:38.534
uh, Aerosmith and The Who.

20:38.536 --> 20:40.134
But still there's
absolutely no doubt

20:40.136 --> 20:42.438
that during the '60s,
the Squirrels were clearly,

20:42.440 --> 20:47.278
if not in the top 10, then,
minimum, in the top 15.

20:48.246 --> 20:49.644
If you don't count

20:49.646 --> 20:51.679
Jefferson Airplane
and Led Zeppelin.

20:51.681 --> 20:54.216
And I think you
have to count them.

20:54.218 --> 20:55.551
Uh...

20:55.553 --> 20:57.386
Think you also have to count
the Temptations.

20:57.388 --> 21:00.121
And the Miracles.
And the Four Tops.

21:00.123 --> 21:01.189
Uh...

21:01.191 --> 21:03.525
Dion & the Belmonts
and the Mamas and the Papas.

21:03.527 --> 21:06.495
So, just to be safe,
let's say the Squirrels

21:06.497 --> 21:08.400
were unquestionably
in the top 20.

21:09.467 --> 21:12.133
Let's be safer,
let's make it top 30.

21:12.135 --> 21:13.835
Or 35.

21:13.837 --> 21:15.371
Or... 40.

21:15.373 --> 21:17.005
Because now that I think
about it,

21:17.007 --> 21:20.008
there was really a number
of great groups in the '60s.

21:20.010 --> 21:22.544
The Four Tops, the Shirelles,
the Doors,

21:22.546 --> 21:24.178
Martha and the Vandellas.

21:24.180 --> 21:25.880
Simon and Garfunkel.

21:25.882 --> 21:27.015
Cream.

21:27.017 --> 21:29.118
Jan and Dean.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.619
The Everly Brothers.

21:30.621 --> 21:33.221
Frank Zappa
and the Mothers of Invention.

21:33.223 --> 21:35.090
Creedence Clearwater Revival.

21:35.092 --> 21:36.492
The Lovin' Spoonful.

21:36.494 --> 21:38.092
Gladys Knight and the Pips.

21:38.094 --> 21:39.361
Gladys Knight without the Pips.

21:39.363 --> 21:40.996
The Pips without Gladys Knight.

21:40.998 --> 21:43.599
Then there were the Doors.
Sly and the Family Stone.

21:43.601 --> 21:47.736
The Shangri-Las...
that's 456, 7 and 8.

21:47.738 --> 21:49.071
So...

21:49.073 --> 21:51.340
It's just to say,
while the Squirrels were good,

21:51.342 --> 21:54.008
they only had one hit, and...

21:54.010 --> 21:56.512
Now that I think about it,
they only had one song,

21:56.514 --> 21:59.214
which means that either
the back of their record was...

21:59.216 --> 22:03.819
totally blank or it just had
"Do the Squirrel" on both sides.

22:03.821 --> 22:06.455
To be honest,
I barely remember the song.

22:06.457 --> 22:08.623
I'm not sure
I ever really heard it.

22:08.625 --> 22:11.259
I was about 9 when it came out.

22:11.261 --> 22:13.696
And... that was like
50 years ago.

22:13.698 --> 22:16.998
And it was only on the charts
for a couple of weeks.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.903
It's not like it was a classic.

22:20.071 --> 22:21.370
I'm guessing, if the Squirrels

22:21.372 --> 22:25.073
hadn't been frozen
and defrosted...

22:25.075 --> 22:27.478
nobody would be making
a documentary about them.

22:31.181 --> 22:32.616
Do I still get paid for this?

22:53.336 --> 22:54.769
Ahhh.

22:54.771 --> 22:56.705
Yaaa.

23:20.363 --> 23:21.766
Peekaboo!

23:35.345 --> 23:37.211
Steve Schmidt here at Appleton
Cryonics with...

23:37.213 --> 23:39.348
Joyceann Miller.

23:39.350 --> 23:40.815
So tell our viewers,
Joyce,

23:40.817 --> 23:42.351
what exactly is it
that you do here?

23:42.353 --> 23:44.053
It's Joyceann.

23:44.055 --> 23:45.187
Oh, sorry.

23:45.189 --> 23:48.090
Joyce-Ann,
please tell us

23:48.092 --> 23:49.792
what it is that
you do here.

23:49.794 --> 23:50.758
Joyceann.

23:50.760 --> 23:53.861
Joyceann.
It's all one name.

23:53.863 --> 23:56.532
My mother had a hard time
deciding on names.

23:56.534 --> 23:58.266
Everybody
gets it wrong at first.

23:58.268 --> 24:00.771
It's the same deal with
my brother, Bobdave.

24:02.405 --> 24:07.342
Okay, well,
Joyceann...

24:07.344 --> 24:10.178
what exactly is it
that you do here?

24:10.180 --> 24:11.482
Nothing yet.

24:12.482 --> 24:14.682
I'm just starting.

24:14.684 --> 24:16.685
But I was teaching
movement and music

24:16.687 --> 24:18.120
at the Baby Badgers
Preschool over on...

24:18.122 --> 24:19.487
College Avenue.

24:19.489 --> 24:21.390
That's where Dr. Fisher's
granddaughter goes.

24:21.392 --> 24:24.325
And he called me up one day
and offered me a job

24:24.327 --> 24:26.160
making three times
what I had been making,

24:26.162 --> 24:28.362
so I said, yeah, sure.

24:28.364 --> 24:29.797
Yeah, sure.

24:29.799 --> 24:32.367
So, what did Dr. Fisher
say the job would be?

24:32.369 --> 24:34.303
So, he said
it would be doing

24:34.305 --> 24:36.071
pretty much what I had
been doing,

24:36.073 --> 24:39.344
but I'd just be working now
with giant toddlers.

24:42.345 --> 24:45.416
Steve Schmidt,
ANC News.

24:47.084 --> 24:48.484
Boys, are you ready?

24:50.086 --> 24:51.253
Go!

24:53.223 --> 24:54.922
Okay, come on.

24:54.924 --> 24:56.524
Oh-wo-wo.

24:56.526 --> 24:57.726
Yes!

24:57.728 --> 25:01.964
Oh, we got
a leader here.

25:01.966 --> 25:04.032
Anyone gonna
beat him?

25:04.034 --> 25:06.735
Without running.

25:06.737 --> 25:08.303
Use your feet.

25:08.305 --> 25:10.240
Use your feet!

25:13.344 --> 25:16.213
Congratulations.
Enjoy your treat.

25:17.347 --> 25:18.980
Everybody congratulate
your friend.

25:18.982 --> 25:21.416
No grabbing!
No, no, no, no.

25:21.418 --> 25:23.252
All right, give that
back to him.

25:23.254 --> 25:25.821
That was his win!
Bucky, no!

25:25.823 --> 25:27.956
Bucky! Back to him!

25:27.958 --> 25:32.660
Hey, Bucky, I'm not kidding.
Back! Open! Open!

25:32.662 --> 25:35.030
Here you go.
You did that fair and square.

25:36.132 --> 25:37.466
That's right, that's...

25:37.468 --> 25:41.305
Come on.
Come on, there you go.

25:44.307 --> 25:45.509
Come on.

25:47.076 --> 25:47.945
Easy.

25:51.981 --> 25:54.382
Pretty, huh?

25:54.384 --> 25:57.285
I'm going to have to...
Ooh! come on, Bucky.

25:57.287 --> 26:00.354
Come on, this way.
There you go.

26:00.356 --> 26:01.892
On the path, guys.
On the path.

26:03.326 --> 26:05.294
On the path.

26:05.296 --> 26:07.129
There we go!

26:08.364 --> 26:10.431
There you go! Okay.

26:10.433 --> 26:12.467
Yes, that's right,
this way.

26:12.469 --> 26:14.836
Come on, up we go.

26:14.838 --> 26:16.371
Come on.

26:16.373 --> 26:18.306
We've got
a situation here.

26:18.308 --> 26:20.708
All right, everybody stay.
Stay!

26:20.710 --> 26:22.311
Stay, stay!

26:22.313 --> 26:24.379
Stay, Bucky, stay.

26:24.381 --> 26:26.314
Stay.
Everybody like this.

26:26.316 --> 26:27.418
Look.

26:31.221 --> 26:32.389
That's good.

26:40.363 --> 26:42.296
We got it.
There we go!

26:42.298 --> 26:44.399
Well done.
Whoops, stay.

26:44.401 --> 26:46.802
Hold on.
We got a leash off.

26:46.804 --> 26:50.471
Hold it, stay there, guys!
I got it, I got it.

26:50.473 --> 26:52.940
Hold it, hold it.

26:52.942 --> 26:54.275
Well done.

26:54.277 --> 26:56.314
Bucky! Stay!

26:58.449 --> 27:00.248
No bench.
Walking time.

27:00.250 --> 27:02.286
Walking time.

27:11.161 --> 27:13.597
This way, come on.

27:16.033 --> 27:17.431
Freeze, everybody!

27:17.433 --> 27:19.436
Bucky, stop!

Good job, guys.

29:12.915 --> 29:15.684
Bucky, you're supposed
to be exercising, honey.

29:15.686 --> 29:18.687
You're supposed to be
moving your body now.

29:18.689 --> 29:21.188

29:21.190 --> 29:24.159
Mr. Fisher's lunch.

29:24.161 --> 29:25.526
Oh, hold on.

29:25.528 --> 29:29.363
Guys. That's 25 minutes.
You can stop now, stop walking.

29:32.402 --> 29:34.035
Oh, no, no, no,
my fault, my fault!

29:34.037 --> 29:36.405
You gotta keep walking
until the machine stops.

29:37.607 --> 29:38.873
The treadmill
is still on.

29:38.875 --> 29:40.441
Keep going.

29:40.443 --> 29:42.476
No, no, no.
No, I'm stopping it.

Stop! Everybody stop.

29:51.154 --> 29:52.322
Good workout.

29:54.091 --> 29:56.457
I'm here with
Dr. Laura Adams,

29:56.459 --> 29:58.092
chief staff
psychologist here

29:58.094 --> 29:59.727
at Appleton Cryonics.

29:59.729 --> 30:01.630
I'd like to begin by
asking you your name

30:01.632 --> 30:03.532
and what your
position is here.

30:03.534 --> 30:05.503
Didn't you just say it?

30:07.036 --> 30:09.103
Oh, yes, I did.

30:09.105 --> 30:12.174
So...
we'll just move on.

30:12.176 --> 30:14.275
What about your
background and work

30:14.277 --> 30:15.880
here at
Appleton Cryonics?

30:17.213 --> 30:18.482
What about it?

30:20.150 --> 30:22.083
Would you tell us
about it?

30:22.085 --> 30:24.218
Oh, of course.

30:24.220 --> 30:27.089
I have a doctorate
in psychology,

30:27.091 --> 30:29.925
specializing in the field
of biopsychology,

30:29.927 --> 30:32.593
and for the past five years,
I've been doing

30:32.595 --> 30:34.830
theoretical research,
specifically,

30:34.832 --> 30:38.934
on what the psychological
ramifications might be

30:38.936 --> 30:42.003
if someone were to be
resuscitated

30:42.005 --> 30:44.809
after years of being
artificially frozen.

30:45.976 --> 30:47.676
And?

30:47.678 --> 30:48.946
And?

30:53.217 --> 30:55.950
And what are
the ramifications?

30:55.952 --> 31:00.490
Oh, um, at this point,
we basically don't know.

31:05.863 --> 31:06.797
S...

31:07.898 --> 31:10.631
So, would you say that
at this point,

31:10.633 --> 31:12.900
you basically
don't know?

31:12.902 --> 31:14.969
That's what I just said.

31:14.971 --> 31:15.906
Oh, boy.

31:17.540 --> 31:19.609
Okay, there
you have it.

31:22.145 --> 31:25.215
Steve Schmidt,
ANC News.

31:27.718 --> 31:32.019
Okay, so now what we're going to
do is, I'm going to say a word

31:32.021 --> 31:35.055
and I want you to say the first
word that comes to your mind.

31:35.057 --> 31:35.959
Okay?

Terday.

33:16.927 --> 33:20.594
Terday?

33:20.596 --> 33:21.963
Yes.

33:21.965 --> 33:23.434
Terday.

33:25.102 --> 33:26.234
All...

33:26.236 --> 33:28.035
my...

33:28.037 --> 33:29.437
troubles...

33:29.439 --> 33:31.372
seemed so...

33:31.374 --> 33:33.777
far away.

33:36.078 --> 33:38.380
Beatles.

33:38.382 --> 33:41.082
Very good.

33:41.084 --> 33:42.316
Very good.

33:43.987 --> 33:48.622
You know, the Squirrels really
affected me in a big way.

33:48.624 --> 33:52.459
I first heard
the Squirrels song,

33:52.461 --> 33:55.063
uh, in an elevator,

33:55.065 --> 33:56.898
uh, going up to the, uh...

33:56.900 --> 34:00.701
to one of several doctor's
appointments that I had.

34:00.703 --> 34:01.969
And, uh...

34:01.971 --> 34:05.340
I was feeling pretty good
until the song came on,

34:05.342 --> 34:07.175
and I looked
around the elevator,

34:07.177 --> 34:10.812
and everyone started doing
this dance, the Squirrel dance,

34:10.813 --> 34:14.748
and, uh, I was so shaken by it,
I pissed in my pants.

34:14.750 --> 34:17.918
I wore black after I heard
the song the first time.

34:17.920 --> 34:19.254
I was a happy guy.

34:19.255 --> 34:21.221
But when I heard that song

34:21.223 --> 34:23.792
and realized
how stupid society is

34:23.793 --> 34:26.060
and how they go after
such crap...

34:26.062 --> 34:28.429
I mean, they turned my
whole life around in a bad way

34:28.431 --> 34:29.897
in college
when I heard that song.

34:29.899 --> 34:32.500
I got deeply depressed,
and I was basically mourning

34:32.502 --> 34:35.136
for myself for even appreciating
that song.

34:35.138 --> 34:36.804
I... I blame them

34:36.806 --> 34:39.206
for all the hundreds
of thousands of dollars

34:39.208 --> 34:40.808
that I spent on psychotherapy.

34:40.810 --> 34:43.911
It just triggered something
in me, and now they're back.

34:43.913 --> 34:47.114
I'm sorry for rambling because
the Squirrels have gotten me...

34:47.116 --> 34:49.750
I'm only doing this because
I need some closure

34:49.752 --> 34:51.553
in my life now
with this group.

34:51.554 --> 34:54.422
So, you know, I'm very upset.

34:54.424 --> 34:55.857
I'm going to need a little rest

34:55.859 --> 34:57.962
after this interview,
to be honest.

34:59.596 --> 35:02.129
Dr. Adams is about to enter
the next crucial stage

35:02.131 --> 35:04.565
of the Squirrels' counseling
when she reveals to them

35:04.567 --> 35:07.034
the full extent
of what has happened to them.

35:07.036 --> 35:10.440
My producers tell me we're
about to go live right now.

35:14.343 --> 35:15.676
Yes, we are.

35:15.678 --> 35:18.679
We now cut live
to Dr. Adams' office

35:18.681 --> 35:23.917
right n...

35:23.919 --> 35:24.788
now!

35:29.759 --> 35:31.326
First of all,

35:31.328 --> 35:34.728
you have each
improved greatly.

35:34.730 --> 35:37.931
You've regained much
of your ability to talk

35:37.933 --> 35:39.466
and to walk.

35:39.468 --> 35:43.004
Your cognitive speech patterns
and coordination

35:43.006 --> 35:45.038
have all improved
greatly.

35:45.040 --> 35:46.674
Well done, everybody.

35:46.676 --> 35:47.875
Thank you.

35:47.877 --> 35:49.210
Thank you.

35:49.212 --> 35:50.210
Thank you.

35:50.212 --> 35:51.312
Thank you.

35:51.314 --> 35:52.312
You're
quite welcome.

35:52.314 --> 35:53.783
So are you.

35:55.618 --> 35:59.721
So, I think it's time
to explain something to you,

35:59.723 --> 36:01.522
why we have kept you
separated

36:01.524 --> 36:03.824
from the rest
of the outside world.

36:03.826 --> 36:06.861
It was to be certain
that you had the tools

36:06.863 --> 36:08.029
to...

36:08.031 --> 36:12.766
understand, react to,
and psychologically deal

36:12.768 --> 36:15.804
with what I'm about
to tell you.

36:15.806 --> 36:17.672
Uh-oh.

36:17.674 --> 36:19.540
Why uh-oh?

36:19.542 --> 36:23.210
Bucky's worried,
that's why uh-oh.

36:23.212 --> 36:24.913
Well, I'm not worried.

36:24.915 --> 36:26.448
Well, I am.

36:26.450 --> 36:28.415
Well, I'm not.

36:28.417 --> 36:30.284
Well, I am.

36:30.286 --> 36:31.219
Okay, boys.

36:31.221 --> 36:32.386
I'm not.

36:32.388 --> 36:33.587
But I am.

36:33.589 --> 36:34.589
Boys,
focus, please.

36:34.591 --> 36:36.357
- I'm not.
- But I...

36:36.359 --> 36:37.591
I know.

36:37.593 --> 36:40.194
I need to caution you that,
at first,

36:40.196 --> 36:41.929
this may be very difficult

36:41.931 --> 36:43.968
for you to understand
and accept.

36:46.502 --> 36:49.002
Okay, now I'm worried.

36:49.004 --> 36:51.608
I am, too.

36:53.542 --> 36:56.210
When your plane crashed

36:56.212 --> 36:58.580
and you were buried
in the snow,

36:58.582 --> 37:01.748
it wasn't, as you believe,

37:01.750 --> 37:04.351
for a relatively
short time.

37:04.353 --> 37:06.524
It was longer.

37:09.292 --> 37:10.792
Longer?

37:10.794 --> 37:12.192
It was longer?

37:12.194 --> 37:13.761
Yes, longer.

37:13.763 --> 37:15.797
How much longer?

37:15.799 --> 37:18.969
Like a couple
of days longer?

37:20.770 --> 37:23.804
Much longer.

37:23.806 --> 37:25.272
Much longer?

37:25.274 --> 37:28.275
Was it a week lon...

37:28.277 --> 37:31.279
It was
longer than a week?

37:31.281 --> 37:33.547
It wasn't a week.

37:33.549 --> 37:35.385
It was longer.
It was...

37:36.852 --> 37:39.286
It was actually...

37:39.288 --> 37:42.089
for almost 50 years.

37:43.192 --> 37:46.627
No. Seriously.

37:46.629 --> 37:47.929
Seriously.

37:47.931 --> 37:49.998
No. Seriously.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.969
Yeah, really,
really seriously.

37:54.303 --> 37:55.636
- Seri...
- Like...

37:55.638 --> 37:57.571
Seri...
Seriously?

37:57.573 --> 37:59.774
Seriously.

37:59.776 --> 38:01.676
Like, three weeks?

38:01.678 --> 38:03.814
No, Bucky.

38:05.181 --> 38:06.851
50 years.

38:22.799 --> 38:24.602
50 years?

38:28.203 --> 38:30.473
50 years.

38:33.209 --> 38:35.212
50 years.

38:36.712 --> 38:38.515
50 years.

38:45.087 --> 38:46.853
The shock that the Squirrels
had virtually been

38:46.855 --> 38:48.723
in a state
of suspended animation

38:48.725 --> 38:52.359
for the last near half-century
finally registered with them.

38:52.361 --> 38:53.861
Dr. Adams
has spent the last week

38:53.863 --> 38:56.496
giving them a crash course
in the last 50 years

38:56.498 --> 38:58.433
of cultural history.

38:58.435 --> 39:00.067
This just came in.

39:00.069 --> 39:01.368
This just in.

39:01.370 --> 39:03.370
The pilot of the Squirrels'
downed aircraft,

39:03.372 --> 39:05.073
90-year-old
Captain Frank Fowler...

39:05.075 --> 39:06.607
now Father Fowler...

39:06.609 --> 39:09.042
has just learned that
the Squirrels didn't perish,

39:09.044 --> 39:10.645
but were all found alive.

39:10.647 --> 39:12.379
Now, if you recall,
Father Fowler,

39:12.381 --> 39:14.482
out of guilt for parachuting
from the plane,

39:14.484 --> 39:17.585
joined a monastic order,
took a sacred vow of silence,

39:17.587 --> 39:20.087
and has not spoken
in nearly 50 years.

39:20.089 --> 39:21.688
Upon learning the news,

39:21.690 --> 39:23.824
the shock apparently caught
the father off guard.

39:23.826 --> 39:27.931
He blurted out "holy shit"
and was promptly excommunicated.

39:31.734 --> 39:36.404
Uh, I would like to apologize
to the viewers at home

39:36.406 --> 39:37.904
for my language.

39:37.906 --> 39:39.741
I just was...

39:39.743 --> 39:41.609
handed this report
directly off the wire.

39:41.611 --> 39:43.076
Did not have a chance
to proof it.

39:43.078 --> 39:45.812
I, of course, would never
have intentionally

39:45.814 --> 39:47.550
said "shit" on the air.

39:50.085 --> 39:51.555
Shit.

39:54.723 --> 39:56.491
We now cut...

39:56.493 --> 40:00.495
live to Dr. Adams' office,
where she is completing

40:00.497 --> 40:03.130
her presentation.

40:03.132 --> 40:06.466
So, I know you all must
have a bunch of questions.

40:06.468 --> 40:08.335
Who would like to go first?

40:08.337 --> 40:10.437
What's dubstep?

40:10.439 --> 40:13.775
What, and boba ball
in the tea?

40:13.777 --> 40:15.442
It's in the tea?

40:15.444 --> 40:20.781
Tell me again what
the Kardashians are famous for.

40:20.783 --> 40:22.884
I wanna see
Phil Westerbrook.

40:22.886 --> 40:25.386
Uh, excuse me,
we're in session.

40:25.388 --> 40:27.554
Can you tell me what
this is regarding?

40:27.556 --> 40:31.759
Oh, my God, you look
exactly the same.

40:31.761 --> 40:33.393
I mean, exactly!

40:33.395 --> 40:34.929
This is freaky.

40:34.931 --> 40:37.832
This is also very inappropriate.
Who are you?

40:37.834 --> 40:38.736
Anna Russo?

40:41.004 --> 40:44.172
I'm Anna Russo,
I was his wife.

40:44.174 --> 40:46.741
Your wife.
Until you were dead.

40:46.743 --> 40:49.342
And then I took the insurance
money and bought a condo.

40:49.344 --> 40:50.978
And you're here
because...?

40:50.980 --> 40:55.248
Because my shrink told me
that I had to apologize to Phil

40:55.250 --> 40:57.587
for forcing him to marry me.

40:58.687 --> 41:02.690
You have nothing
to apologize for.

41:02.692 --> 41:04.792
Oh, yes I do!

41:04.794 --> 41:06.730
Junior, get in here!

41:12.835 --> 41:14.768
I'm sorry. Out!

41:14.770 --> 41:17.605
Yeah, you just...
You should go.

41:17.607 --> 41:18.906
Um...

41:18.908 --> 41:21.408
Why don't you just...
you have a seat, honey.

41:21.410 --> 41:22.576
Sit down,
sit down.

41:22.578 --> 41:24.645
Yeah, sit down, Phil.
Let's move on.

41:24.647 --> 41:26.647
Yeah. Okay.

41:26.649 --> 41:31.719
Well, since we've already had
one unannounced visitor,

41:31.721 --> 41:35.422
I might as well tell you
that there is someone else

41:35.424 --> 41:38.058
who has been waiting
patiently to see you.

41:38.060 --> 41:41.261
Uh, it's actually someone
who I think you guys

41:41.263 --> 41:43.130
are going to be
very happy to see.

41:43.132 --> 41:44.632
Is it Elvis?

41:44.634 --> 41:49.636
No. It's your agent,
Mort Fishbeck.

41:49.638 --> 41:51.739
OMG.

41:51.741 --> 41:53.908
Okay, so you don't
actually say that.

41:53.910 --> 41:55.243
It's just for typing.

41:55.245 --> 41:58.879
LOL, LOL.

41:58.881 --> 42:00.181
PPO.

42:00.183 --> 42:01.681
Mr. Fishbeck,
if you could...

42:01.683 --> 42:02.650
LPE.

42:02.652 --> 42:03.750
Be right there.

42:03.752 --> 42:05.788
Here he comes.

42:07.556 --> 42:10.257
Some old guy's
wearing Mort's clothes.

42:10.259 --> 42:13.361
No, no, it's me, it's Mort.
Remember the Squirrel salute?

42:13.363 --> 42:14.761
Mort!

42:14.763 --> 42:17.998
Look at you guys.
Oh, look at you guys!

42:18.000 --> 42:19.533
Look at you!

42:19.535 --> 42:23.404
Oh, look at you.
Oh, look at you!

42:23.406 --> 42:24.772
Look at you.

42:24.774 --> 42:25.806
Look at you.

42:25.808 --> 42:26.873
Okay.

42:26.875 --> 42:28.810
If I were representing

42:28.812 --> 42:30.344
the Mormon
Tabernacle Choir,

42:30.346 --> 42:31.946
I'd be squeezing
faces all day!

42:31.948 --> 42:34.781
You remember them,
it's like a big group of people,

42:34.783 --> 42:36.984
the Mormon...
So, listen...

42:36.986 --> 42:41.188
Besides being frozen in a crashed
plane for 50 years, what's new?

42:41.190 --> 42:42.957
I had canned cheese.

42:42.959 --> 42:45.826
I've gotta pee
so much!

42:45.828 --> 42:46.993
What is this?

42:46.995 --> 42:50.198
Oh, my landlord won't
let me have a cat.

42:50.200 --> 42:53.600
Now, that was a joke.
You get it?

42:53.602 --> 42:54.634
No.

42:54.636 --> 42:56.937
Come on, you guys.
Gimme a hug.

42:56.939 --> 42:58.105
He's being silly.

42:58.107 --> 42:59.940
Oh, God, oh, that hurts.

42:59.942 --> 43:01.442
Oh, it's Mort.

43:01.444 --> 43:04.478
I can't breathe, hold it.
Lean back a little.

43:04.480 --> 43:06.647
<i>...experience in
hot and cold protection.</i>

43:06.649 --> 43:09.049
<i>From an independent
family-owned business</i>

43:09.051 --> 43:10.717
<i>that's never been afraid
to give you</i>

43:10.719 --> 43:12.853
<i>exactly what's right
for your engine...</i>

43:12.855 --> 43:16.390
Mort, maybe we could do
a commercial for them.

43:16.392 --> 43:20.161
We were frozen, now we're not.
Peak Antifreeze.

43:20.163 --> 43:21.661
Mmm, delicious.

43:21.663 --> 43:25.933
No, no, no, you don't drink it.
It's antifreeze, it's for cars.

43:25.935 --> 43:28.636
Yeah, it's for cars.
Cars drink it.

43:28.638 --> 43:31.138
Yeah, I know.
I was being silly.

43:31.140 --> 43:32.640
He was
just being silly.

43:32.642 --> 43:37.078
Yeah, Mort, Randy is
very good at being silly.

43:37.080 --> 43:38.411
Hey, hey, Mort.

43:38.413 --> 43:43.516
Remember when I was shy,
and you said,

43:43.518 --> 43:46.786
"Don't be so shy"?

43:46.788 --> 43:49.556
And then I wasn't
shy anymore.

43:49.558 --> 43:54.261
And, Mort, remember when you
were gone for like a few months,

43:54.263 --> 43:57.198
and you came back
much tanner

43:57.200 --> 43:59.299
and we asked you
where you were

43:59.301 --> 44:00.600
and you were like...

44:00.602 --> 44:03.804
"I was..."

44:03.806 --> 44:05.205
Remember?

44:05.207 --> 44:06.841
Yep.

44:06.843 --> 44:08.475
Remember when you said,

44:08.477 --> 44:12.746
"I don't have my wallet,
let's get outta here"?

44:13.549 --> 44:15.616
He said that one
a lot.

44:15.618 --> 44:17.551
That was one
of his favorites.

44:17.553 --> 44:19.853
Hope he likes
the crust.

44:19.855 --> 44:21.755
Give him a bite.

44:21.757 --> 44:22.924
Here.

44:22.926 --> 44:24.125
Here.

44:24.127 --> 44:25.692
Aaah!

44:25.694 --> 44:26.794
Oh!

44:26.796 --> 44:29.330
His hair...
was that his hair?

44:29.332 --> 44:31.598
His eyebrows
are reaching for it.

44:31.600 --> 44:34.335
His hair and his eyebrows
are becoming one.

44:34.337 --> 44:35.770
Whoa!

44:35.772 --> 44:37.038
Guys, guys.

44:37.040 --> 44:38.705
He's sleeping.

44:38.707 --> 44:41.975
We can put the naughty
channel on.

44:48.651 --> 44:53.286
"And then the banks received

44:53.288 --> 44:56.426
another bailout."

45:07.636 --> 45:10.538
When I was a toddler
back in Long Island,

45:10.540 --> 45:12.105
there was this sweet
little woman

45:12.107 --> 45:13.507
who lived across
the hall from us.

45:13.509 --> 45:14.975
Her name was Duda,

45:14.977 --> 45:18.011
and my mom thinks maybe she was
Hungarian or something.

45:18.013 --> 45:22.315
Um, anyway, Duda spoke
hardly any English,

45:22.317 --> 45:25.152
so all we really knew about her
was her name

45:25.154 --> 45:27.520
and that, whenever Duda
heard me crying,

45:27.522 --> 45:29.957
she'd rush across the hall
and pick me up

45:29.959 --> 45:33.694
and rock me in her arms
and sing this Hungarian lullaby.

45:33.696 --> 45:37.935
And miraculously,
I'd instantly fall asleep.

45:38.567 --> 45:40.336
Um...

45:41.636 --> 45:43.506
One second, please,
I'm sorry.

45:45.741 --> 45:50.544
Um, one day, Duda was gone.
She moved away.

45:50.546 --> 45:54.181
And we never heard
from her again.

45:54.183 --> 45:55.915
And then recently my mom

45:55.917 --> 45:57.917
saw a picture of the Squirrels
on the news

45:57.919 --> 45:59.620
and she remembered that Duda
used to have

45:59.622 --> 46:01.321
the same exact picture
of the Squirrels

46:01.323 --> 46:02.922
hanging on her wall
in her apartment.

46:02.924 --> 46:04.558
Really weird, right?

46:04.560 --> 46:07.694
Um, so, when we heard
about this documentary,

46:07.696 --> 46:09.596
we thought that,
when it came out,

46:09.598 --> 46:11.866
maybe Duda would go see it
and see me in it

46:11.868 --> 46:16.002
and somehow we'd be able
to reunite with her.

46:16.004 --> 46:18.105
And with that in mind,
here is the lullaby that...

46:18.107 --> 46:21.509
in Hungarian, I think...
that Duda used to sing to me.

46:21.511 --> 46:25.215
In pretty much her only English,
she called it "Duda's Girl."

53:30.339 --> 53:31.808
Come on,
let's go.

53:34.542 --> 53:39.145
Bucky, I really like that shirt
on you.

53:39.147 --> 53:40.980
Thanks.

53:40.982 --> 53:42.683
I really like it
on me, too.

53:42.685 --> 53:44.917
That's why
I put it on me.

53:44.919 --> 53:48.221
Guys, I figured out

53:48.223 --> 53:51.792
why they call underpants
underpants.

53:51.794 --> 53:55.596
'Cause they go under
your pants.

53:55.598 --> 53:56.864
Oh. Wow.

53:56.866 --> 53:58.431
Wow!

53:58.433 --> 54:00.433
Then why don't they call

54:00.435 --> 54:03.804
the pants you wear
over your underpants

54:03.806 --> 54:06.005
overpants?

54:06.007 --> 54:07.040
Hmm.

54:07.042 --> 54:08.975
That's a good question.

54:08.977 --> 54:10.944
No, it's not.

54:10.946 --> 54:12.748
- It's not?
- No.

54:14.116 --> 54:15.919
It's a great question.

54:17.986 --> 54:20.953
Randy is very good
at asking questions.

54:20.955 --> 54:24.460
Do you know why I'm so good
at asking questions?

54:25.828 --> 54:27.363
No, why?

54:28.696 --> 54:30.998
I don't know,
I was asking you.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.732
- I got a question.
- Uh-oh.

54:32.734 --> 54:33.900
Let's hear it.

54:33.902 --> 54:38.105
If you were stuck
on a desert island

54:38.107 --> 54:41.375
and you could only bring
41 things,

54:41.377 --> 54:43.176
what would you bring?

54:43.178 --> 54:44.277
- Underpants.
- Toothpaste.

54:44.279 --> 54:45.645
- Maps.
- Toothpaste.

54:45.647 --> 54:47.313
- Cold ice cubes.
- Maps.

54:47.315 --> 54:48.915
Cold ice cubes.

54:48.917 --> 54:50.551
Clothes.

54:50.553 --> 54:51.884
Maps.

54:51.886 --> 54:53.853
- A book.
- A safe.

54:53.855 --> 54:55.054
A book.

54:55.056 --> 54:56.355
How many
is that?

54:56.357 --> 54:58.991
If... if...

54:58.993 --> 55:01.694
Who do you think would win
in a fight,

55:01.696 --> 55:03.730
a grizzly bear

55:03.732 --> 55:08.167
or a grizzly bear
with a mustache?

55:08.169 --> 55:09.236
Is the...

55:09.238 --> 55:11.138
Is the mustache
real?

55:11.140 --> 55:13.906
Do you guys ever think

55:13.908 --> 55:17.710
maybe we never made it
out of the ice?

55:17.712 --> 55:19.413
Hey, Squirrels!

55:19.415 --> 55:20.746
How are you doin'?

55:20.748 --> 55:22.214
Hi!

55:22.216 --> 55:24.650
You guys look
so handsome.

55:24.652 --> 55:27.453
- Thank you, you too.
- You look so handsome.

55:27.455 --> 55:30.623
- That's a lovely suit.
- So handsome, Dr. Adams.

55:30.625 --> 55:32.391
The three buttons,
good number.

55:32.393 --> 55:34.560
You're wearing
a man's clothes.

55:34.562 --> 55:36.228
Well,
we talked about that.

55:36.230 --> 55:37.464
Women can wear suits.

55:37.466 --> 55:38.732
No, they can't.

55:38.734 --> 55:41.033
You guys remember
where we're going today?

55:41.035 --> 55:43.236
Squirrel Mania!

55:44.906 --> 55:47.507
All right, let me just
finish my drink.

55:47.509 --> 55:49.275
- Okay.
- Put it on this.

55:49.277 --> 55:51.243
Okay, careful,
don't dribble.

55:51.245 --> 55:52.846
Let's take this
with us.

55:52.848 --> 55:55.147
No, let's leave that.
I don't think we need that.

55:55.149 --> 55:58.051
We can surf it.
Whoaaa!

55:58.053 --> 55:59.620
Let's go surfin'.

56:00.656 --> 56:01.855
Come on, Buck,
we've got ya.

56:01.857 --> 56:03.593
It's pretty big.

56:05.995 --> 56:08.094
Guys... okay.

56:08.096 --> 56:09.562
Whoaaaa!

56:09.564 --> 56:11.364
In case
I get cold.

56:11.366 --> 56:12.833
His teeth were red.

56:12.835 --> 56:14.935
We might have to bring
an extra diaper.

56:14.937 --> 56:16.506
I'll get 'em.

56:22.377 --> 56:23.576
We're all out!

56:23.578 --> 56:25.212
- Randy, come on!
- We used 'em.

56:25.214 --> 56:29.185
- We're leaving, Squirrel Mania.
- Oh, yell at the helpful one.

56:32.154 --> 56:33.520
This is crazy,

56:33.522 --> 56:35.254
the line goes all the way
around the block.

56:35.256 --> 56:37.156
How did everybody know
we were here?

56:37.158 --> 56:39.859
Social media.
Facebook, Twitter.

56:39.861 --> 56:41.361
Don't look at me,

56:41.363 --> 56:43.429
I don't have one of those
Internet machine things.

56:43.431 --> 56:44.931
Yeah, you do,
it's a computer.

56:44.933 --> 56:46.632
Oh, I do, I have one.

56:46.634 --> 56:50.469
You know, we are more popular,
now that we're alive again

56:50.471 --> 56:55.275
than we were when we were alive
before we were dead.

56:55.277 --> 56:58.944
I think your brain needs
to defrost a little bit.

56:58.946 --> 57:00.946
Yeah.

57:00.948 --> 57:02.351
Oh, hi.

57:03.451 --> 57:05.721
I survived
a plane crash.

57:07.189 --> 57:09.589
And who should I make
this out to?

57:09.591 --> 57:10.656
IRS.

57:10.658 --> 57:14.261
Iris. Well, that's
a pretty name.

57:14.263 --> 57:15.795
Here you go.

57:15.797 --> 57:17.200
You're under arrest.

57:25.873 --> 57:27.306
Steve Schmidt, ANC News,

57:27.308 --> 57:30.210
here at IRS headquarters
in Appleton, Wisconsin,

57:30.212 --> 57:31.243
where Bucky
and the Squirrels

57:31.245 --> 57:33.679
are being charged
with tax evasion

57:33.681 --> 57:36.650
for not filing
their taxes in 1968,

57:36.652 --> 57:38.851
the year they disappeared.

57:38.853 --> 57:40.754
If they'd paid
their taxes that year,

57:40.756 --> 57:43.723
they would have owed
a mere $300 each.

57:43.725 --> 57:47.960
But, after over half a century
of interest and penalties,

57:47.962 --> 57:53.734
each of the squirrels
now owes $649,000.

57:53.736 --> 57:55.768
And as a group...

57:55.770 --> 57:59.406
or, as they call it in the animal
kingdom, a drey of squirrels...

57:59.408 --> 58:04.745
that means they owe $2,596,000,

58:04.747 --> 58:09.583
and are facing at least
five years in prison.

58:09.585 --> 58:11.717
I don't want to go
to prison.

58:11.719 --> 58:12.685
Who does?

58:12.687 --> 58:13.719
Not me.

58:13.721 --> 58:15.087
Not me.

58:15.089 --> 58:16.056
Not me.

58:16.058 --> 58:17.089
Not me.

58:17.091 --> 58:18.125
Not me.

58:18.127 --> 58:19.558
Mort, n-none...

58:19.560 --> 58:22.862
None of us wants
to go to prison.

58:22.864 --> 58:24.431
Hmm-mm.
Who would?

58:24.433 --> 58:26.632
I don't know.

58:26.634 --> 58:30.703
Maybe someone who has
friends there?

58:30.705 --> 58:34.306
Or maybe someone
who likes the food.

58:34.308 --> 58:35.708
I bet that some people

58:35.710 --> 58:38.044
even like
the prison outfits.

58:38.046 --> 58:40.246
I bet some people don't.

58:40.248 --> 58:43.984
So those people probably wouldn't
want to go to prison, right?

58:43.986 --> 58:46.520
Unless they liked the food

58:46.522 --> 58:49.688
more than they didn't like
the outfits.

58:49.690 --> 58:52.558
When somebody has
a birthday in prison,

58:52.560 --> 58:54.761
does everybody
get birthday cake

58:54.763 --> 58:57.531
or just that guy
whose birthday it is?

58:57.533 --> 59:00.232
Because, with all
those prisoners,

59:00.234 --> 59:01.801
that's like six
or seven or eight

59:01.803 --> 59:04.437
or nine or ten
birthdays a day.

59:04.439 --> 59:07.507
Whoa! That's
a lot of cake.

59:07.509 --> 59:11.545
What if somebody got
allergic to the cake?

59:11.547 --> 59:15.281
If I was allergic to cake,
and I was in prison,

59:15.283 --> 59:17.216
and they tried to make me
eat that cake

59:17.218 --> 59:20.020
that I was allergic to,
I wouldn't eat it.

59:20.022 --> 59:21.087
Me either.

59:21.089 --> 59:22.688
What could
they do to you?

59:22.690 --> 59:25.591
Oh, they could do
some stuff.

59:25.593 --> 59:27.726
They could lock you
up in timeout.

59:27.728 --> 59:30.297
They could rough
you up a little bit.

59:30.299 --> 59:32.265
Maybe give you
the hose!

59:32.267 --> 59:34.801
Or... or...

59:34.803 --> 59:36.937
they could take away
your birthday cake.

59:36.939 --> 59:39.339
I never thought
of that.

59:39.341 --> 59:42.842
I don't... I don't want
to go to prison.

59:42.844 --> 59:43.613
Who does?

59:45.247 --> 59:46.580
Not me.

59:46.582 --> 59:47.681
Not me.

59:47.683 --> 59:48.714
Not me.

59:48.716 --> 59:49.815
Not me.

59:49.817 --> 59:51.150
Not me.

59:51.152 --> 59:52.719
Who would?

59:52.721 --> 59:54.587
M-maybe...

59:54.589 --> 59:56.623
maybe someone who
has friends there?

59:56.625 --> 01:00:00.025
Or maybe someone
who likes the food?

01:00:00.027 --> 01:00:01.661
I bet
that some people

01:00:01.663 --> 01:00:04.297
even like
the prison outfits.

01:00:04.299 --> 01:00:06.065
I bet some people
don't.

01:00:06.067 --> 01:00:09.569
So those people probably wouldn't
want to go to prison, right?

01:00:09.571 --> 01:00:12.638
Unless they liked the food

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:15.174
more than they didn't like
the outfits.

01:00:15.176 --> 01:00:17.344
All right, come on.

01:00:17.346 --> 01:00:20.683
Mort... Mort...
Mort... Mort.

01:00:23.352 --> 01:00:24.951
Mort!

01:00:24.953 --> 01:00:26.553
Hi, Mort.

01:00:26.555 --> 01:00:27.620
Mort!

01:00:27.622 --> 01:00:29.221
Hey, what are you
doing to him?

01:00:29.223 --> 01:00:30.357
Come on!

01:00:30.359 --> 01:00:31.757
I wanted Mort
to stay.

01:00:31.759 --> 01:00:32.893
Stay.

01:00:32.895 --> 01:00:35.495
Sit down, you're just
gonna make things worse.

01:00:35.497 --> 01:00:38.464
I knew that they
didn't want Mort here.

01:00:38.466 --> 01:00:41.533
Mort! Sneaking's
not gonna help. Mort!

01:00:41.535 --> 01:00:43.803
Cheese and rice
almighty.

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:48.007
Stay out!

01:00:48.009 --> 01:00:49.708
Careful, he's...

01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:50.743
old.

01:00:50.745 --> 01:00:52.913
- I don't wanna go to prison.
- Who does?

01:00:52.915 --> 01:00:53.946
Just sit, okay?

01:00:53.948 --> 01:00:56.116
Behave yourself.

01:00:56.118 --> 01:00:57.583
Mort!

01:00:57.585 --> 01:01:00.487
Hey, we told you
to stay outside.

01:01:00.489 --> 01:01:02.288
You're back!

01:01:04.459 --> 01:01:07.027
You can have my chair.

01:01:07.029 --> 01:01:10.996
Why are you taking...
He has to stay.

01:01:10.998 --> 01:01:12.031
Bye, Mort.

01:01:12.033 --> 01:01:12.966
Sit!

01:01:12.968 --> 01:01:14.199
Who does?

01:01:14.201 --> 01:01:15.734
Sit!

01:01:15.736 --> 01:01:16.636
Stay!

01:01:16.638 --> 01:01:18.571
Can Mort come back in?

01:01:18.573 --> 01:01:21.241
Can you... can we get
our questions answered?

01:01:26.314 --> 01:01:27.446
Mort!

01:01:27.448 --> 01:01:30.752
- Hi, Mort.
- Not again.

01:01:44.031 --> 01:01:45.799
Bucky, guys?

01:01:45.801 --> 01:01:47.199
Are you okay?

01:01:47.201 --> 01:01:47.870
Are you all right?

01:01:50.305 --> 01:01:53.707
Uh, Mr. Fishbeck. What happened?
What's going on?

01:01:53.709 --> 01:01:56.275
The Squirrels are doing
a concert.

01:01:56.277 --> 01:01:57.613
Ohh!

01:02:06.154 --> 01:02:08.989
As many of you know,
last week the IRS filed a case

01:02:08.991 --> 01:02:11.690
against the Squirrels
for 50 years of unpaid taxes,

01:02:11.692 --> 01:02:14.527
amounting to over $2.5 million.

01:02:14.529 --> 01:02:16.228
In an effort to settle the case

01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:17.696
and keep the Squirrels
out of prison,

01:02:17.698 --> 01:02:20.100
Manager Mort Fishbeck
has represented that the band

01:02:20.102 --> 01:02:23.569
is capable of performing
and of earning enough money

01:02:23.571 --> 01:02:26.473
to settle their debt
with the IRS.

01:02:26.475 --> 01:02:28.808
To that end,
Manager Mort Fishbeck

01:02:28.810 --> 01:02:30.676
has scheduled
a test-case performance

01:02:30.678 --> 01:02:32.978
right here
in the school's alma mater,

01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:34.647
Lawrence University.

01:02:34.649 --> 01:02:36.750
Several questions remain.

01:02:36.752 --> 01:02:38.917
After 50 years encased
in solid Swiss ice,

01:02:38.919 --> 01:02:41.321
are the Squirrels still
capable of performing?

01:02:41.323 --> 01:02:42.755
Will they be any good?

01:02:42.757 --> 01:02:45.692
And are they headed
to stardom again

01:02:45.694 --> 01:02:48.627
or simply headed to prison?

01:02:48.629 --> 01:02:51.431
We'll find out the hard way.

01:02:51.433 --> 01:02:54.366
I'm Steve Schmidt, ANC News.

01:02:54.368 --> 01:02:56.902
Okay, 1...

01:02:56.904 --> 01:02:58.404
1, 2...

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:01.540
1, 2, 3, 4...

01:03:11.852 --> 01:03:13.752
Ow, ow, ow!

01:03:13.754 --> 01:03:17.457
Okay, guys, stop.
Stop, stop.

01:03:17.459 --> 01:03:21.627
Doug, Doug.
Doug, stop, stop.

01:03:21.629 --> 01:03:22.495
Stop.

01:03:22.497 --> 01:03:24.029
What's the matter?

01:03:24.031 --> 01:03:25.632
I'm sorry,
it was my fault.

01:03:25.634 --> 01:03:28.167
I couldn't hold onto my...
I kept dropping my...

01:03:28.169 --> 01:03:30.804
what do you call them?

01:03:30.806 --> 01:03:32.038
Uh, the hitters.

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:33.672
Yeah, drumsticks.

01:03:33.674 --> 01:03:36.442
You'd think I would
remember what they were called.

01:03:36.444 --> 01:03:38.745
Yeah, don't be so
hard on yourself.

01:03:38.747 --> 01:03:42.515
It's gonna take a while for
things to come back to normal.

01:03:42.517 --> 01:03:45.018
Yeah, but you would think
that I would remember

01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:48.120
what these are called because
I use them to play the...

01:03:48.122 --> 01:03:49.154
Drums.

01:03:49.156 --> 01:03:50.156
The drums.

01:03:50.158 --> 01:03:51.391
I always forget

01:03:51.393 --> 01:03:53.725
what the strum thing
is called.

01:03:53.727 --> 01:03:58.998
But other than what's-his-name
dropping his whaddya-call-em...

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.132
The drumsticks.

01:04:00.134 --> 01:04:01.567
Drumsticks, right.

01:04:01.569 --> 01:04:03.368
Other than drumsticks
dropping his hitters,

01:04:03.370 --> 01:04:05.871
what's...
how do we sound?

01:04:05.873 --> 01:04:08.241
Yeah, Mort?
How are we soundin'?

01:04:08.243 --> 01:04:10.446
Is it good?

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:14.379
Okay, you guys want
the truth?

01:04:14.381 --> 01:04:15.681
- Yeah.
- I'll tell ya.

01:04:15.683 --> 01:04:17.583
Mort, can I just
have a word with you?

01:04:17.585 --> 01:04:19.321
For one second?
Just, come on.

01:04:21.989 --> 01:04:24.723
They are very
fragile right now.

01:04:24.725 --> 01:04:26.592
I'm fragile, too.
My ears are fragile.

01:04:26.594 --> 01:04:28.828
I know, but they are
looking to you...

01:04:28.830 --> 01:04:30.529
They're making me
nauseous.

01:04:30.531 --> 01:04:32.098
They're not gonna
get it.

01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:33.632
They're going
to get better.

01:04:33.634 --> 01:04:36.268
You need to build them up,
not break them down.

01:04:36.270 --> 01:04:37.670
Build them up.

01:04:37.672 --> 01:04:39.675
Okay? Be nice.

01:04:44.178 --> 01:04:45.346
Okay.

01:04:46.381 --> 01:04:48.517
Guys, guys, look.

01:04:49.683 --> 01:04:51.687
I've never
lied to you, right?

01:04:53.421 --> 01:04:56.692
So I'm gonna be honest
with you now.

01:04:58.326 --> 01:05:01.094
You need to practice.

01:05:01.096 --> 01:05:03.062
Trust me,
you can only get better.

01:05:03.064 --> 01:05:07.699
And I promise, I will get better
when I stop dropping the...

01:05:07.701 --> 01:05:08.701
Hitters.

01:05:08.703 --> 01:05:11.804
The hitters!
The drumsticks!

01:05:11.806 --> 01:05:14.607
Absolutely, absolutely.
Practice makes perfect.

01:05:14.609 --> 01:05:17.844
You guys, keep playing till
I tell you to stop, okay?

01:05:17.846 --> 01:05:21.114
Mort, they have more strings
than me.

01:05:21.116 --> 01:05:23.283
You'll be fine.
You've got plenty.

01:05:23.285 --> 01:05:25.284
Okay? All right.
You guys play.

01:05:25.286 --> 01:05:26.652
I'm gonna go take
a leak, okay?

01:05:26.654 --> 01:05:28.388
Okay, Mort,
thank you.

01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:31.190
Which will be a lot more
entertaining than what they're doing.

01:05:31.192 --> 01:05:32.692
I'm gonna go
with him.

01:05:32.694 --> 01:05:34.259
Yeah, great.

01:05:34.261 --> 01:05:36.228
What do you think?

01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:37.732
I think they're going
to prison.

01:05:45.207 --> 01:05:46.839
They couldn't be worse
if they tried.

01:05:46.841 --> 01:05:48.373
Well, they're trying.

01:05:48.375 --> 01:05:50.275
Steve Schmidt,
ANC News.

01:05:50.277 --> 01:05:51.643
Dr. Adams, how
would you assess

01:05:51.645 --> 01:05:53.515
the Squirrels'
progress to date?

01:05:54.848 --> 01:05:56.015
Uh...

01:05:56.017 --> 01:05:59.252
I don't really feel
that I am qualified

01:05:59.254 --> 01:06:04.290
to discuss things
that have music in them.

01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:09.629
Mr. Fishbeck,
sounds as though

01:06:09.631 --> 01:06:11.598
the boys are having
a tough go of it.

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:14.067
Really? Well, that shows
what little you know.

01:06:14.069 --> 01:06:16.703
And what little you know,
you know even less.

01:06:16.705 --> 01:06:20.209
They happen to be saving
themselves for the concert.

01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:25.111
Well, there you have it.

01:06:25.113 --> 01:06:26.712
From this reporter's
perspective,

01:06:26.714 --> 01:06:28.915
if this concert
is as big a disaster

01:06:28.917 --> 01:06:31.917
as it seems destined to be,
to quote the Beatles,

01:06:31.919 --> 01:06:34.254
the Squirrels will have
"a ticket to ride"

01:06:34.256 --> 01:06:36.321
straight to prison.

01:06:36.323 --> 01:06:38.290
And my baby do care.

01:06:38.292 --> 01:06:39.558
I don't wanna go
to prison.

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:42.395
Steve Schmidt, ANC News.

01:07:08.022 --> 01:07:09.054
Steve Schmidt, ANC News,

01:07:09.056 --> 01:07:10.089
here in the beautiful

01:07:10.091 --> 01:07:11.089
Stansbury Theatre

01:07:11.091 --> 01:07:12.058
on the campus

01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:13.225
of Lawrence University,

01:07:13.227 --> 01:07:14.893
where we're just moments away

01:07:14.895 --> 01:07:18.196
from the much-anticipated
Squirrels comeback concert.

01:07:18.198 --> 01:07:19.699
Now, full disclosure.

01:07:19.701 --> 01:07:21.533
The building is surrounded
by IRS agents.

01:07:21.535 --> 01:07:23.002
They're also in the wings,

01:07:23.004 --> 01:07:24.804
ready to take the Squirrels
into custody

01:07:24.806 --> 01:07:27.739
should they not live up to their
alleged performance skills.

01:07:27.741 --> 01:07:29.341
But we're just gonna
think positive,

01:07:29.343 --> 01:07:30.877
focus on the Squirrels.

01:07:30.879 --> 01:07:32.812
So let's talk to some
Squirrels fans right now.

01:07:32.814 --> 01:07:35.848
Excuse me, sir, ma'am, what
brings you to see the Squirrels?

01:07:35.850 --> 01:07:41.054
Well, I dated Bucky
when we were in college.

01:07:41.056 --> 01:07:42.788
Yeah, and she still has a scar

01:07:42.790 --> 01:07:44.991
from a hickey
that Bucky gave here.

01:07:44.993 --> 01:07:46.125
Ohh!

01:07:46.127 --> 01:07:47.960
That's enough.

01:07:47.962 --> 01:07:49.362
That is enough.

01:07:49.364 --> 01:07:50.862
For live news.

01:07:50.864 --> 01:07:52.598
The energy
is just electric here.

01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:55.368
It's just like
an electricity factory...

01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:58.237
of fireflies.

01:07:58.239 --> 01:08:00.073
Excuse me, miss,
what about you?

01:08:00.075 --> 01:08:01.406
Me?

01:08:01.408 --> 01:08:03.442
Yes. What brings you
to see the Squirrels?

01:08:03.444 --> 01:08:05.011
Oh, God, um...

01:08:05.013 --> 01:08:06.478
Okay, well,
basically,

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:08.147
I just wanted
to see people

01:08:08.149 --> 01:08:10.949
that were like frozen and then
like brought back to life.

01:08:10.951 --> 01:08:13.553
And also, I kind of
have this like crush

01:08:13.555 --> 01:08:15.388
on Phil, which
I know is weird

01:08:15.390 --> 01:08:16.888
because like if he
hadn't been frozen,

01:08:16.890 --> 01:08:19.091
I mean, which he was,
but if he hadn't been,

01:08:19.094 --> 01:08:20.892
he'd be like
my grandpa's age.

01:08:20.894 --> 01:08:22.527
And I know that's
weird, but like...

01:08:22.529 --> 01:08:23.729
Yay, Lawrence, right?

01:08:23.732 --> 01:08:25.765
But Lawrence isn't
my grandpa.

01:08:25.767 --> 01:08:27.834
That's the school here
that unfroze them.

01:08:27.836 --> 01:08:30.602
And, um, I'm like
super nervous.

01:08:30.604 --> 01:08:31.870
Hey, Mom!

01:08:31.872 --> 01:08:33.004
Hey, Mom!

Not only does Randy
not do the Squirrel dance,

01:10:19.613 --> 01:10:21.213
but on top of that, the guys
don't even look

01:10:21.215 --> 01:10:22.815
like they're playing
their instruments.

01:10:22.817 --> 01:10:25.317
I mean, we're gonna
keep an eye on things,

01:10:25.319 --> 01:10:27.755

This is exactly
what I was afraid of.

01:11:06.027 --> 01:11:07.627
It's very clear
to this reporter

01:11:07.629 --> 01:11:09.762
that these boys are simply
not ready to perform.

01:11:09.764 --> 01:11:12.097
And frankly, I'm not sure
they ever will be.

01:11:12.099 --> 01:11:13.665
The bad news

01:11:13.667 --> 01:11:15.901
is that the Squirrels
are going to prison.

01:11:15.903 --> 01:11:17.869
The good news is that
they'll have a minimum

01:11:17.871 --> 01:11:21.339
of five to seven years
to rehearse.

01:11:21.341 --> 01:11:22.909
You know I have a weakness...

01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:31.116
We've gotta
get you out of here!

01:11:31.118 --> 01:11:32.250
We're not just gonna
walk out.

01:11:32.252 --> 01:11:33.652
You can't
go back out there.

01:11:33.654 --> 01:11:36.054
The audience is gonna
eat you guys alive.

01:11:36.056 --> 01:11:37.757
Can you blame 'em, Mort?

01:11:37.759 --> 01:11:39.991
They came here for a show,
and that was not a show.

01:11:39.993 --> 01:11:42.093
There's no way, Mort. They're
right, we're not leaving.

01:11:42.095 --> 01:11:43.963
If we just walk away,
we'd be throwing away

01:11:43.965 --> 01:11:46.031
everything we worked for,
and that would be giving up.

01:11:46.033 --> 01:11:47.866
And we've never given up,
you taught us that.

01:11:47.868 --> 01:11:51.803
Mort, Mort, we are never gonna
get another chance like this.

01:11:51.805 --> 01:11:53.039
Especially if we're
in prison.

01:11:53.041 --> 01:11:55.141
Wait, you guys,
Listen to yourselves.

01:11:55.143 --> 01:11:56.575
No, Dr. Adams, we know, okay?

01:11:56.577 --> 01:11:58.610
We know what you're gonna say,
we're not gonna walk away.

01:11:58.612 --> 01:12:01.480
No, listen to yourselves.
You sound normal again.

01:12:01.482 --> 01:12:03.048
What are you talking
about, Dr. Adams?

01:12:03.050 --> 01:12:04.749
Sh-she's right.

01:12:04.751 --> 01:12:07.186
What do you mean
she's right?

01:12:07.188 --> 01:12:09.989
Oh, my God, she's right.
You're right.

01:12:09.991 --> 01:12:11.891
I don't get it.

01:12:11.893 --> 01:12:13.225
Me either.

01:12:13.227 --> 01:12:15.794
I'm guessing the stress
of the situation

01:12:15.796 --> 01:12:17.762
shocked your systems
back to normal.

01:12:17.764 --> 01:12:20.132
I thought stuff like that
only happened in the movies.

01:12:20.134 --> 01:12:21.667
It's happening.
I feel good.

01:12:21.669 --> 01:12:24.169
You know what,
I think we can do this, guys.

01:12:24.171 --> 01:12:26.739
I don't know about you,
but I'm going back out there.

01:12:26.741 --> 01:12:28.341
Not by yourself,
you're not.

01:12:28.343 --> 01:12:29.575
Come on, guys,
let's do this.

01:12:29.577 --> 01:12:32.143
I'm one step ahead of ya.
Go, go, go!

01:12:39.854 --> 01:12:41.286
Please, don't go.

01:12:41.288 --> 01:12:43.559
Everybody, please, don't go.

01:12:45.059 --> 01:12:48.227
Just give us one more shot,
let us try it again.

01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:49.965
I think I'm
gonna cry.

01:12:51.532 --> 01:12:55.301
