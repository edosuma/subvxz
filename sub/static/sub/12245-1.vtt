00:58.992 --> 01:01.463
-Come on, come on.

01:04.539 --> 01:06.383
Grab onto me!

01:08.200 --> 01:09.200
-Help!

01:09.942 --> 01:10.942
-Dad?

01:13.297 --> 01:15.551
-Rick! Rick!

01:15.575 --> 01:17.575
-Dad! No!

01:17.767 --> 01:20.171
-Lucas!

01:20.814 --> 01:22.680
-Tremors have started again.

01:24.775 --> 01:26.775
Three to four times a day now.

01:29.065 --> 01:31.938
Maybe it's because everything
just keeps getting colder all the time.

01:33.104 --> 01:34.104
I don't know.

01:35.010 --> 01:36.854
Everyone's afraid.

01:37.448 --> 01:39.515
It reminds me of when I was a boy.

01:39.538 --> 01:42.848
Comet U-23 hurtled through
our solar system.

01:43.997 --> 01:48.524
And the whole world watched.
Waiting to see if the comet meant life

01:49.818 --> 01:50.818
or death.

01:52.052 --> 01:53.052
The comet

01:54.200 --> 01:56.235
struck the Pacific with the magnitude

01:56.260 --> 01:59.199
of all the nuclear weapons
in all the world.

02:00.615 --> 02:02.269
Cults were gone in minutes.

02:03.600 --> 02:06.400
The inlet surge flooded the Great Plains.

02:09.616 --> 02:11.062
My father

02:12.373 --> 02:16.605
was a ranger in the sanction
of Crystal Mountains in Colorado.

02:17.170 --> 02:19.104
We escaped the flooding.

02:21.418 --> 02:22.884
We were the lucky few.

02:23.894 --> 02:25.494
Then the freezing began.

02:28.074 --> 02:29.910
Comet U-23

02:29.934 --> 02:33.496
had knocked the Earth out
of its orbit.

02:34.278 --> 02:36.836
That was 10,000 days ago.

02:38.391 --> 02:40.006
I was five.

02:42.134 --> 02:45.200
I am now a man of 31 and
a leader of our clan.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.336
My name is Lucas Beck.

02:55.276 --> 02:58.580
Remy Farnwell's family lived
with our clan for 15 years.

03:00.097 --> 03:03.392
Remy claims they were forced out.

03:04.995 --> 03:07.129
And now they covet what is ours,

03:08.792 --> 03:10.175
tried to kill us.

03:11.730 --> 03:13.996
The men who were once our brothers

03:15.847 --> 03:17.180
are now our enemies.

03:38.648 --> 03:39.648
And now

03:41.195 --> 03:45.106
we have Farnwells living
to our north and south

03:45.339 --> 03:46.339
waiting.

03:48.003 --> 03:49.593
Always waiting.

04:35.260 --> 04:37.060
-Mom, another stone, quick.

04:39.534 --> 04:40.600
-Over here, dad.

04:42.307 --> 04:43.507
Lam 'em down easy.

04:43.901 --> 04:45.226
-Here we go.

04:45.540 --> 04:47.524
- Where did you find him?
- He came from the north.

04:47.549 --> 04:48.447
- Farnwells clan.
- He was alone?

04:48.472 --> 04:52.205
- Yeah, he was alone. I
found him on the putter ice field.

04:52.229 --> 04:54.229
- Were there stress fractures?
- No.

04:54.331 --> 04:56.713
There was an uplifting in the ice.
- So it's true?

04:57.234 --> 04:58.701
The ice is thickening.

04:58.725 --> 05:00.488
-Lower your voice.

05:00.512 --> 05:02.139
-You're afraid, I understand that.

05:02.162 --> 05:04.818
Last winter we saw this,
the uplifting in the ice.

05:04.843 --> 05:08.202
I won't have you scaring everyone.
- They're already scared, Lucas.

05:08.226 --> 05:10.124
Unlike your father,

05:10.148 --> 05:12.148
we chose not to be in denial.

05:12.172 --> 05:14.172
The boy was alone.

05:14.196 --> 05:17.476
They're all dead; You know it.
- That's enough.

05:29.108 --> 05:30.775
Where's your family, boy?

05:33.366 --> 05:35.790
- The ice took 'em.
- Took 'em how?

05:44.365 --> 05:45.898
-Please, we wanna help.

05:48.717 --> 05:49.717
-It was like...

05:50.678 --> 05:51.678
something evil

05:52.561 --> 05:55.755
had just come up
and crushed them.

05:55.983 --> 05:56.983
-How long ago?

05:57.959 --> 06:01.292
- It was morning.
- There could still be survivors.

06:03.061 --> 06:05.932
-Boy, do you think anyone survived?

06:08.074 --> 06:09.074
-No.

06:33.103 --> 06:34.346
-How's he doing?

06:34.986 --> 06:36.186
-Well, he's scared,

06:37.135 --> 06:38.268
doesn't trust us.

06:40.752 --> 06:42.845
-Veena, you know he has to go.

06:43.588 --> 06:45.723
- Lucas said this?
- No, my brother said nothing.

06:46.338 --> 06:48.471
-So why do you say he has to go?

06:48.666 --> 06:51.033
- The clan's safety isn't
important to you?

06:51.369 --> 06:54.056
- Of course it is, but someone
has to care for this boy.

06:54.135 --> 06:55.920
-The Farnwells care for their own.

06:59.228 --> 07:00.827
I mean it. If he stays here,

07:01.189 --> 07:02.723
Remy will come for him.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.471
If we don't have
enough rations...

07:07.496 --> 07:09.642
- Well, I'll share mine.
Lucas would agree with me.

07:12.234 --> 07:14.130
- You expect too much
from my brother.

07:14.154 --> 07:15.312
You always have.

07:16.742 --> 07:19.640
- You think Lucas would send this
boy where even he is afraid to go?

07:19.665 --> 07:21.341
-Lucas is afraid of nothing.

07:22.961 --> 07:23.961
-You're wrong.

07:24.508 --> 07:25.508
He fears.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.335
Not for himself, but he
fears for all of us.

07:28.453 --> 07:30.053
And that I'd understand.

07:30.656 --> 07:34.563
But that is no reason to send
this boy to what may be his death.

08:01.859 --> 08:03.592
-It's Farnwell's ice, man.

08:04.249 --> 08:05.516
-I'll check it out.

08:05.773 --> 08:06.773
-Milo!

08:07.859 --> 08:08.859
-Here.

08:38.683 --> 08:41.849
- Oh my God.
- What is it?

09:31.737 --> 09:32.737
-Dad.

09:36.237 --> 09:37.580
-This is fantastic.

10:08.944 --> 10:10.687
- You said the ship
was blue and white?

10:11.647 --> 10:12.647
-Yeah.

10:14.210 --> 10:17.210
- Any lettering? A name?
- Three letters. UNI.

10:17.546 --> 10:19.346
Above the windows or below?

10:19.530 --> 10:20.530
-Above.

10:22.311 --> 10:24.955
- You know the president was
in the air when the come hit.

10:25.718 --> 10:28.022
They thought the east
coast was ground zero.

10:28.046 --> 10:30.647
But instead of sending them
to Mount Weather in Virginia,

10:31.827 --> 10:33.160
they sent them west.

10:33.757 --> 10:34.757
To Edwards.

10:34.936 --> 10:37.336
- You think it was
the Air Force One?

10:37.702 --> 10:39.653
- I won't know for sure
until we get inside.

10:40.116 --> 10:41.667
-What's an an force one?

10:41.912 --> 10:43.662
- Remember when you were a
kid we used to lay out on

10:43.687 --> 10:45.452
the roof and watch for the
planes to go overhead

10:45.476 --> 10:47.123
I told you to watch for the biggest one?

10:47.147 --> 10:48.967
- I'm surprised they're not
flying on the White House.

10:48.992 --> 10:50.992
- Air Force One.
- None of this explains

10:51.016 --> 10:54.954
how they ended up frozen in an ice
field here at the Sangre De Cristo's.

10:55.040 --> 10:58.095
- No it doesn't, but I'm predicting
no one made it off the jet.

10:58.119 --> 11:00.472
- Why do you say that?
- You said the doors are sealed.

11:00.496 --> 11:02.496
The crew has sent out survivors.

11:02.520 --> 11:04.946
- Their fuze launch was intact.
Somebody must have survived.

11:04.970 --> 11:06.970
-So why didn't they leave the jet?

11:07.049 --> 11:08.927
-Maybe it was safer inside.

11:12.517 --> 11:14.247
- What are we gonna
find on that jet?

11:14.541 --> 11:15.941
-It's a time capsule.

11:16.799 --> 11:18.399
-We could find anything.

11:18.721 --> 11:20.494
-Some pillows would be really nice.

11:21.463 --> 11:23.890
- I'll see you in the back.
- Help me get the gear together.

11:23.914 --> 11:25.914
- Where are we going?
- Hey guys, I got a theory.

11:26.994 --> 11:28.394
They were headed west

11:28.471 --> 11:31.342
not knowing they were headed
towards the comet's impact zone.

11:31.366 --> 11:33.845
-You want a son, I understand.

11:33.869 --> 11:36.642
- He has no family, and if I raise
him, what's wrong with that?

11:36.721 --> 11:37.988
-You've told Lucas?

11:39.135 --> 11:42.661
Why do you find it so difficult
to be honest with him?

11:42.685 --> 11:44.685
-Everything about us is difficult.

11:49.185 --> 11:50.185
Boy?

11:51.513 --> 11:53.113
I told him to stay put!

12:01.348 --> 12:02.348
-Here you go.

12:05.083 --> 12:06.416
-What are you doing?

12:06.661 --> 12:07.661
-It's okay.

12:07.770 --> 12:08.770
He's starving.

12:08.966 --> 12:10.699
-Your sister's the doctor.

12:10.723 --> 12:12.446
Okay? Not you.

12:12.864 --> 12:15.731
- Yes, but I know when
someone needs to eat.

12:16.442 --> 12:17.580
It's okay. Eat.

12:21.317 --> 12:23.117
-You gave him a full trout?

12:23.254 --> 12:24.254
Are you crazy?

12:24.582 --> 12:26.316
That's a six-month ration.

12:29.871 --> 12:30.871
Look...

12:31.679 --> 12:32.679
-It's okay.

12:33.637 --> 12:36.449
- You gotta stop wasting our
resources on this kid.

12:36.473 --> 12:38.886
We can't trust him.
He's a Farnwell.

12:40.894 --> 12:44.468
- And he can't trust us if we're
whispering and keeping secrets.

12:48.050 --> 12:49.971
- Whoa, wait.
- Wait!

12:52.285 --> 12:53.831
-He didn't leave the building.

12:59.623 --> 13:02.023
-We're gonna get in so much trouble.

13:15.231 --> 13:16.364
-Wait! Don't run!

13:19.317 --> 13:22.358
- Stop it. It's okay. It's okay.

13:22.973 --> 13:25.706
- We need to lock him up
our put him out.

13:25.730 --> 13:27.426
-No, dad! He's just a boy!

13:27.451 --> 13:29.027
- He's a danger to us all
just by being here.

13:29.051 --> 13:31.466
- Please, Lucas, you can't
treat him like an animal.

13:31.490 --> 13:34.395
- We all know Remy will come for him.
- And so he will do what?

13:39.665 --> 13:42.998
- This can't happen again.
He's under your charge.

13:56.775 --> 13:59.175
- Why is it that we
always get stuck

13:59.199 --> 14:01.705
powering these blood lamps?

14:03.376 --> 14:04.990
-You're such a baby.

14:05.015 --> 14:08.479
- It's because they like
feeding on young blood

14:08.503 --> 14:12.034
and besides, our bodily fluids can
replenish faster than old peoples'.

14:14.096 --> 14:17.896
My arms hurt. Your turn to
charge flashlights. I'm done.

14:18.049 --> 14:19.536
Come on, trade.

14:24.244 --> 14:25.796
-Hey, I heard that.

14:28.221 --> 14:29.821
Who are you calling old?

14:29.916 --> 14:31.383
-You know what I mean.

14:31.510 --> 14:32.510
-Listen,

14:33.572 --> 14:35.507
as soon as those blood lamps are full,

14:35.635 --> 14:37.502
bring them downstairs, okay?

14:37.688 --> 14:39.555
We're heading the ice lines.

15:03.671 --> 15:05.204
-Is there another door?

15:05.229 --> 15:07.707
- All the other doors are closed
with too much ice in the way.

15:07.945 --> 15:11.343
- Can you see through the ice?
Come over here.

15:12.101 --> 15:14.388
-Hey right over here.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.992
- Why you're writing a
journal still baffles me.

15:31.369 --> 15:32.836
-So not to forget how.

15:34.025 --> 15:35.896
-Paper is precious fuel, sister.

15:36.697 --> 15:38.800
-Going to the northern clan?

15:40.260 --> 15:41.260
-Yeah.

15:41.838 --> 15:44.101
-Send greetings to my nephews.

15:45.244 --> 15:46.511
Give these to them.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.747
Tell them I love them and

15:49.041 --> 15:50.374
health to your wife.

15:51.377 --> 15:52.377
-Our father,

15:53.494 --> 15:54.494
he brought these

15:55.400 --> 15:57.605
from a tiny island
in the Caribbean.

15:58.924 --> 15:59.924
Aruba.

16:00.557 --> 16:03.557
- Yes. From a time and
place I've never known.

16:04.624 --> 16:05.903
-Imagine a home

16:06.631 --> 16:09.964
where you never cover your skin,
never feel cold.

16:12.460 --> 16:14.460
Lucas has had a taste of this.

16:15.194 --> 16:17.194
-His clan feels the cold, too.

16:17.483 --> 16:21.102
- Your good will toward
the Becks is misguided.

16:22.061 --> 16:24.061
What is that? Product of love?

16:24.069 --> 16:27.582
- A desire for peace, brother.
- Peace...

16:28.514 --> 16:31.875
When our father fought
to keep disease from the clan,

16:32.141 --> 16:34.141
Lucas' father ignored him.

16:34.499 --> 16:37.554
He brought death to our mother.
- We were one clan then.

16:38.233 --> 16:40.166
I don't blame them as you do.

16:40.190 --> 16:41.932
You and father started that fight.

16:42.175 --> 16:45.047
- You lost us our home!
- And in the ten years since,

16:45.327 --> 16:46.795
what have they offered us?

16:47.053 --> 16:49.272
- Then they should open
the doors to all of us.

16:49.296 --> 16:53.067
They don't have the resources, so you would
take from them and offer them death.

16:53.217 --> 16:55.550
I want no part in your fight.
- Oh!

16:55.575 --> 16:57.936
I fight for our lives.

16:58.381 --> 17:02.426
'Cause next year the temperature will drop
another four degrees as it does every year.

17:02.450 --> 17:05.279
And Lucas and his clan will be alive

17:05.303 --> 17:10.560
in the observatory, and their doors will
not be open to our dying children!

17:10.829 --> 17:11.829
Will they?

17:14.088 --> 17:15.288
Just so you understand,

17:15.986 --> 17:19.053
nothing good will come
of your love for Lucas.

17:38.768 --> 17:39.768
-Whoa.

18:47.504 --> 18:48.504
-Hey,

18:48.621 --> 18:50.828
when was the last time
you got new clothes?

19:54.806 --> 19:56.696
-This is Air Force One.

21:25.197 --> 21:26.197
-Where's David?

21:28.285 --> 21:30.100
- Where's David?
- David?

21:31.020 --> 21:32.020
-David!

21:32.504 --> 21:33.504
-What?

21:33.840 --> 21:34.840
-David!

21:37.200 --> 21:38.200
David!

21:42.270 --> 21:43.270
-David!

21:44.895 --> 21:46.958
- David!
- David?

21:47.356 --> 21:49.010
David, where are you?

21:49.809 --> 21:50.809
-Do you see him?

22:16.618 --> 22:17.818
-What is all this?

22:19.805 --> 22:22.272
-Something that could save our lives.

22:37.851 --> 22:39.475
-The Northern Plan is gone.

22:40.031 --> 22:42.445
- Gone?
- All 40 solds.

22:43.008 --> 22:44.008
Dead.

22:47.418 --> 22:49.520
-Lucas is responsible.

22:49.739 --> 22:53.072
- We refuse to give him shelter. He
keeps us all out here on the ice.

23:27.765 --> 23:29.848
It's the third time this
week they're pollinated.

23:29.873 --> 23:31.445
We're gonna have
a great harvest.

23:31.615 --> 23:34.087
- I need more insulin.
Mom's blood sugar’s been elevated.

23:34.112 --> 23:36.280
- She's been doing so well
on half doses lately.

23:36.302 --> 23:38.209
- Well, yes, but she
stopped exercising.

23:38.234 --> 23:39.857
- We've got to get her back
on that bike.

23:39.881 --> 23:41.711
- Alright, well, you
talk to her, please.

23:43.366 --> 23:45.178
- The pumpkin harvest
wasn't so good,

23:45.203 --> 23:48.059
so I've mixed a new cocktail of.

23:48.083 --> 23:51.675
Cinnamon and Turmeric. I don't
know how well she'll respond to it.

23:51.858 --> 23:53.324
How's her circulation?

23:53.530 --> 23:56.347
- Not great. She's developed a
skin condition on her toes.

23:56.371 --> 23:59.339
- And how's the boy?
- He's resting.

23:59.363 --> 24:01.363
He enjoys William's guitar.

24:01.834 --> 24:03.301
Let's hope this works.

24:19.256 --> 24:20.256
-Amelie.

24:23.102 --> 24:24.102
You can't be here.

24:24.126 --> 24:26.412
- Please.
- No! How'd you get passed the guards?

24:26.436 --> 24:28.888
- Lucas showed me the way
in case I ever needed to come.

24:28.912 --> 24:32.364
- I will not be a part of this.
- Please, give him this message.

24:37.043 --> 24:39.309
- Before I change my mind.
No, go.

24:50.003 --> 24:52.159
- You're certain this
equipment can save us?

24:52.184 --> 24:54.527
- It has the potential to
save our lives, Lucas.

24:54.652 --> 24:55.956
But there are risks.

24:56.009 --> 24:57.917
- We need to be very clear
on those risks, David.

24:57.941 --> 25:00.459
Lucas doesn't understand it.
- That I get it.

25:00.483 --> 25:02.490
- You get it? You understand
this technology has

25:02.515 --> 25:04.766
the power to destroy
everything that we've

25:04.791 --> 25:06.947
done, everything we've
worked for, everything

25:06.972 --> 25:08.799
that we've built to
secure our future

25:08.823 --> 25:11.836
in an instant. Do you understand that?
- What future? Tell me.

25:12.254 --> 25:13.254
What future?

25:13.676 --> 25:15.283
More snow? More ice?

25:15.307 --> 25:17.307
More freezing cold? More fighting?

25:18.387 --> 25:21.148
Ask Sam. He'll tell you we're
living on borrowed time.

25:21.172 --> 25:25.176
All this, whatever we've done
or built, is a waste of time.

25:27.736 --> 25:31.269
I am willing to risk everything
to change the future.

25:47.922 --> 25:48.922
-A boy.

25:50.313 --> 25:51.313
One of ours.

25:52.984 --> 25:55.101
- Someone came from the
south and found him.

25:55.899 --> 25:56.899
-No...

25:57.461 --> 25:58.848
they took him.

26:03.109 --> 26:04.576
-We're taking on hit.

26:04.819 --> 26:07.405
We've got a lot of comet
fragments everywhere.

26:07.430 --> 26:09.430
Alpha 28955 dropping.

26:09.455 --> 26:10.832
Speed 219.

26:10.855 --> 26:12.855
- Full G force.
- Affirmative.

26:12.879 --> 26:17.185
So much smoke down there.
8850, close that door.

26:17.209 --> 26:18.988
Whoa, we are hit!

26:19.012 --> 26:21.496
Right wing is on fire.
- We're going down!

26:21.520 --> 26:24.747
Air force one, stopping
below the clouds.

26:26.520 --> 26:27.520
-Oh my God.

26:27.706 --> 26:30.385
- Pull up!
- Water. Ah, plenty of altitude.

26:30.527 --> 26:31.527
7900.

26:32.199 --> 26:33.199
-Pull up!

26:33.559 --> 26:36.024
...Pull, pull up, pull up!

26:36.048 --> 26:37.563
Pull up! - I'm trying!

26:42.098 --> 26:45.631
- They never made it back
over the Sangre De Cristo's.

26:45.655 --> 26:48.479
The tsunami the comet created
must have been enormous.

26:49.003 --> 26:52.571
Imagine a 4, 000 foot wave
rolling over the western states.

26:52.956 --> 26:55.274
Fighting the valleys,
heading mountain passes.

26:55.761 --> 26:58.094
Now we know how
they ended up here.

26:58.315 --> 27:00.115
-Tell me about the weapons.

27:00.612 --> 27:02.679
-All of this is NEA technology.

27:03.065 --> 27:05.801
Airborne operations was
retrofitted into Air force One.

27:05.825 --> 27:09.369
- Why?
- So the president, secretary of defense,

27:10.100 --> 27:13.219
military chiefs of staff, could
fight a nuclear war from the air.

27:13.413 --> 27:15.427
-Lucas. - Dad, please.

27:15.451 --> 27:19.604
I need to understand our options here.
All of them.

27:23.270 --> 27:26.877
I think we have access to the
entire US nuclear arsenal.

27:28.473 --> 27:30.240
-How powerful are these weapons?

27:30.263 --> 27:33.026
- Imagine the heat of the
sun, right here, on earth,

27:33.051 --> 27:36.153
and for a split second releasing
its energy all of it at once.

27:36.178 --> 27:38.317
- And you're actually
saying that's an option?

27:39.588 --> 27:42.587
- So if we super heat a
small portion of the continent

27:42.611 --> 27:44.611
maybe we save ourselves
from freezing to death.

27:44.799 --> 27:45.799
-In theory.

27:46.611 --> 27:48.278
-Why wouldn't we do that?

27:48.302 --> 27:50.302
-Because it sounds really dangerous.

27:51.174 --> 27:53.726
- Since when has anything
dangerous bothered you?

27:54.822 --> 27:57.605
- You don't know what these
bombs are capable of, son.

27:58.275 --> 28:00.866
You grew up without any
knowledge of a cold war or

28:00.890 --> 28:02.890
fear of nuclear terrorism?

28:03.252 --> 28:06.847
The radiation released from a single
nuclear bomb could kill us, all of us.

28:07.166 --> 28:10.599
And there is no guarantee that we
won't chain reaction when we do it.

28:11.385 --> 28:14.035
We're try and detonate one
of these things, we might

28:14.060 --> 28:16.462
get ten, we might get fifty, we might
get one hundred. David, am I right?

28:16.487 --> 28:17.487
-Yes.

28:17.511 --> 28:18.976
-So we do nothing.

28:19.477 --> 28:22.759
We have all this technology, this
powerful resource, and we sit on it?

28:24.267 --> 28:26.023
Really, Sam? You're afraid?

28:26.383 --> 28:27.450
-Yeah, a little.

28:29.196 --> 28:31.329
But I still think
it's worth a shot.

28:31.782 --> 28:33.064
-Right. Perhaps

28:33.961 --> 28:34.961
David and I

28:35.196 --> 28:38.863
can trace the identity of the of the
individual weapons to their silos.

28:38.887 --> 28:41.537
We can try and establish
the ideal distance for a

28:41.562 --> 28:44.504
nuclear blast with the
least amount of radiation poisoning.

28:44.770 --> 28:48.829
- If in fact such an ideal exists,
and only if we can get a signal

28:48.853 --> 28:51.946
to reach the silos.
- I'm sorry, but I don't agree.

28:52.715 --> 28:55.105
Are we so terrified that
we're willing to radiate our

28:55.130 --> 28:57.684
planet and risk destroying
everything that we've built?

28:58.739 --> 29:01.872
David, we have seen the results
when men act out of fear.

29:02.653 --> 29:05.476
Before we detonate a nuclear
weapon we have to make damn sure,

29:05.500 --> 29:08.535
absolutely certain, that
it's our last option.

29:08.981 --> 29:11.035
I understand that the
situation is desperate,

29:11.060 --> 29:12.832
I know that we have a
drop in temperature,

29:12.886 --> 29:15.069
I know we have extreme weather.
But I'm convinced it's

29:15.094 --> 29:17.533
mirrored by a warming trend in
another part of the planet.

29:17.558 --> 29:19.512
These are clear manifestations
of global warming.

29:19.536 --> 29:21.536
-Dad, come on. You can't prove it.

29:21.856 --> 29:24.057
- I've been studying the
night sky since the

29:24.082 --> 29:26.087
soot cleared two decades
ago, Lucas, and

29:26.111 --> 29:28.803
I'm not dreaming when I see
Venus and Mars lining up

29:28.828 --> 29:31.469
on the horizon like they
used to when the comet hit.

29:33.002 --> 29:35.594
What I see is a return to unity.

29:36.541 --> 29:40.823
The Sun's gravity has been pulling us back
into our natural orbit for decades now.

29:40.847 --> 29:43.650
And I know that like I
know you two are my sons.

29:44.353 --> 29:46.820
Two years from now,
maybe, maybe five

29:47.088 --> 29:49.540
we're gonna be hiking
right down this mountain...

29:49.791 --> 29:52.345
- Dad, you've been telling me
this story since I was seven.

29:53.319 --> 29:55.119
And I believed you, but now

29:56.444 --> 29:58.977
I'm sorry, it's just
wishful thinking.

29:59.233 --> 30:02.033
And the sad thing is you still believe it.

30:24.750 --> 30:25.950
-It's from Amalie.

30:27.947 --> 30:31.763
I wouldn't give this to you if it weren't
for the love my daughter had for you,

30:32.525 --> 30:34.792
and her desire for your happiness.

30:46.081 --> 30:47.081
Be careful.

30:53.785 --> 30:56.451
- Have you made a
decision about the boy?

30:56.519 --> 30:57.719
-No, I haven't.

30:57.744 --> 31:01.343
- Lucas, why is it so difficult
for you to care for him?

31:04.110 --> 31:08.777
We all need to know where this is headed.
He especially needs to know.

31:09.314 --> 31:10.381
-It's this simple.

31:11.173 --> 31:13.719
He's one more human being
that I'm responsible for.

31:14.064 --> 31:15.064
And for me...

31:15.626 --> 31:16.959
that's one too many.

31:17.665 --> 31:20.465
- Or maybe he reminds
you too much of Remy?

31:22.595 --> 31:24.995
And that makes him
intolerable, huh?

31:29.816 --> 31:30.816
Shame on you.

31:39.929 --> 31:41.929
-Veena wants to raise the boy.

31:43.484 --> 31:45.610
- Remy will come for
him sooner or later.

31:45.634 --> 31:47.135
-Lucas will protect him.

31:48.133 --> 31:50.547
-How do we know the boy wants protecting?

31:50.726 --> 31:53.098
He'll decide for himself
if he wants to stay or go.

31:53.625 --> 31:57.292
It's not a prison.
- Yes, but still, he's just. A. Boy.

31:57.985 --> 32:00.719
And Veena has wanted
a child for so long.

32:01.610 --> 32:03.885
- Well, Veena knew what
waiting would bring.

32:03.909 --> 32:06.235
Hoping Lucas would love
him as she loves him.

32:06.259 --> 32:08.547
- And you have no
compassion for her?

32:10.374 --> 32:11.708
-I love my daughter,

32:12.015 --> 32:13.948
but I see things as they are.

32:14.578 --> 32:17.444
If the boy stays, there's
gonna be trouble.

32:18.132 --> 32:22.399
And a heartache for our daughter,
because he will leave someday.

32:57.566 --> 32:58.832
-You're so serious.

33:02.636 --> 33:05.569
I want you to hold me
and dream for a while.

33:06.402 --> 33:09.569
But you are already so far, far away.

33:20.412 --> 33:22.265
-Am I so far away now?

33:45.425 --> 33:46.425
Amelie...

33:47.168 --> 33:50.301
we were on the Northern
ice field this morning.

33:50.714 --> 33:52.733
The tremors have done a lot of damage.

33:52.757 --> 33:55.636
- How bad?
- The Northern clan...

33:55.661 --> 33:58.648
-No, Lucas...

34:01.296 --> 34:02.296
Remy's wife.

34:03.390 --> 34:04.777
Those boys.

34:05.726 --> 34:07.192
-We have one survivor.

34:08.507 --> 34:10.291
Our boy. He won't
tell us his name.

34:11.054 --> 34:12.839
-My love, look at us.

34:15.170 --> 34:17.036
We're all freezing to death.

34:17.397 --> 34:20.464
An entire village is gone,
and still we fight.

34:20.650 --> 34:23.661
Isn't that the worst kind of torture?
- what would you have me do?

34:23.686 --> 34:24.654
-Unite us.

34:24.679 --> 34:26.906
We don't have the resources.
You know that.

34:26.929 --> 34:30.083
The stress on our food and medical
supplies would put us all in jeopardy.

34:30.109 --> 34:32.918
It'd be madness.
- There are less defeating children now.

34:35.719 --> 34:38.587
- Even if these hardships
could be overcome,

34:39.368 --> 34:42.302
some men are incapable
of living in harmony.

34:48.812 --> 34:49.985
You know that.

34:51.023 --> 34:55.795
You sent me this warning of an impending
attack. Is that not proof it's impossible?

34:56.007 --> 34:59.624
- Then you and I are stuck in the middle
of this and we have nowhere to go.

35:00.586 --> 35:02.593
It's hopeless. - No. Hey...

35:03.906 --> 35:05.106
It's not hopeless.

35:06.257 --> 35:07.524
We found something.

35:09.015 --> 35:12.038
At the village, buried deep
within the ice, something

35:12.199 --> 35:14.532
more powerful than
any of the ideas

35:14.556 --> 35:17.495
that you and I or anyone
we know has ever had.

35:18.769 --> 35:20.502
It could end the freezing.

35:21.425 --> 35:24.625
And all the fighting and
the hunger for revenge.

35:24.816 --> 35:28.764
We're not stuck anywhere except within
the limitations of our imagination.

35:31.410 --> 35:33.610
I have imagined so many outcomes

35:35.254 --> 35:37.654
for all of us over these many years.

35:38.543 --> 35:42.176
And now we have an opportunity
to create change.

35:43.559 --> 35:45.025
So I hope you'll agree

35:47.259 --> 35:50.859
there's nothing hopeless about
the nature of our love.

35:52.040 --> 35:55.507
It's because of it that I
feel anything is possible.

35:56.196 --> 36:00.122
- Your good heart is what keeps me
from running to you each night.

36:02.032 --> 36:03.899
Because I know that patience

36:04.110 --> 36:06.177
is what will bring us together.

36:07.688 --> 36:08.938
All of us.

36:24.440 --> 36:26.707
-Jiro, get your father some water.

36:31.417 --> 36:32.817
-I have only one son.

36:38.342 --> 36:39.342
-What can I do?

36:42.975 --> 36:43.975
-Embrace him.

36:45.451 --> 36:47.098
Tomorrow we fight.

36:47.404 --> 36:48.404
-Wait a while.

36:48.818 --> 36:50.218
You've just returned.

36:50.576 --> 36:53.481
- My belly is burning now.
- Mine as well!

36:55.506 --> 36:56.772
But you're tired...

36:57.818 --> 36:59.551
I can see it in your eyes.

37:00.607 --> 37:02.175
You can't do it all.

37:02.615 --> 37:04.615
I know they all think you can,

37:04.826 --> 37:06.183
but if you die,

37:06.920 --> 37:09.253
you are the life force of the clan.

37:09.277 --> 37:11.474
Without you...
- I will not fail.

37:12.154 --> 37:15.021
- I wish I had your
strength and conviction.

37:16.928 --> 37:17.928
-You do.

37:21.443 --> 37:25.043
- I've died so many small
deaths in the past ten years.

37:25.482 --> 37:27.576
Ice has crept into my soul.

37:28.881 --> 37:29.881
And I'm scared,

37:30.519 --> 37:34.459
because I feel I could kill if you
place me at the death's door.

37:35.264 --> 37:36.797
-Remember that feeling.

37:37.756 --> 37:39.756
One day it may save your life.

37:51.530 --> 37:53.068
Gather the clan.

37:53.702 --> 37:54.702
I have news.

37:55.061 --> 37:56.328
-What news, father?

37:56.366 --> 37:59.232
- There will be no more waiting.
- We fight?

37:59.475 --> 38:01.498
I am ready, father.

38:01.569 --> 38:03.302
Let me fight at your side.

38:04.452 --> 38:06.652
-Do not let the glory of fighting

38:07.342 --> 38:09.676
blind you to the dangers of battle.

38:09.991 --> 38:13.046
The observatory is a weapon in itself.

38:13.288 --> 38:14.381
The ice,

38:14.960 --> 38:16.178
the cliffs...

38:16.874 --> 38:20.741
It is like an eagle's nest
purged at the top of the world.

38:20.765 --> 38:23.003
-Yes, father.

38:28.457 --> 38:29.845
-We're gonna fight together.

38:30.996 --> 38:32.884
We will wear them down

38:33.605 --> 38:36.749
until the nest can no
longer be defended.

38:37.770 --> 38:40.452
-Thank you... father

38:41.238 --> 38:43.434
I will make you proud.

39:03.406 --> 39:04.406
-Hey.

39:04.570 --> 39:05.932
-I'm... I'm... I'm sorry.

39:05.956 --> 39:07.956
- No, that's alright,
that's okay.

39:07.980 --> 39:10.483
-No harm done. Pick it up.

39:11.828 --> 39:13.913
Except that it's all out of
tune and that's my fault.

39:19.515 --> 39:20.515
Here.

39:22.429 --> 39:25.007
Let me see it for a second.
Okay.

39:26.289 --> 39:27.755
It's gotta be in tune.

39:41.105 --> 39:42.105
Not bad.

39:43.879 --> 39:44.879
There we go.

39:46.066 --> 39:47.066
Okay.

39:47.621 --> 39:49.088
First finger goes here

39:49.952 --> 39:52.412
right next to the fret.
Good. Good. Good.

39:52.490 --> 39:54.608
The other two go on there,

39:56.069 --> 39:57.069
One there.

39:57.225 --> 39:58.896
Now, you gotta hold it

39:59.764 --> 40:02.555
tight. You gotta treat the
guitar kind of like a bird.

40:02.774 --> 40:04.646
You want to hold it tight
enough so it doesn't

40:04.671 --> 40:06.342
go away but not so tight
that you hurt it.

40:07.366 --> 40:08.366
Okay.

40:08.788 --> 40:09.854
Let's hear that.

40:12.491 --> 40:13.491
Nice.

40:13.967 --> 40:14.967
That's great!

40:15.592 --> 40:17.792
Okay, show me the next chord.
Oh.

40:18.475 --> 40:19.875
Up two. There you go.

40:19.899 --> 40:21.899
There you go. Right.
Ooh. Try that.

40:26.939 --> 40:29.672
How about the next chord?
Go up two more.

40:30.463 --> 40:32.720
Wanna know to know the
way to a woman's heart?

40:32.744 --> 40:34.236
One note at a time.

40:38.024 --> 40:39.024
One more time.

40:43.586 --> 40:44.586
Every song

40:45.602 --> 40:46.602
ever written,

40:47.500 --> 40:49.428
every song that is
going to be written,

40:49.688 --> 40:50.688
is in here

40:51.242 --> 40:52.242
and is in here.

40:52.727 --> 40:54.393
You just have to find it.

40:55.071 --> 40:56.071
Find your song.

41:19.572 --> 41:21.097
You are a natural.

41:27.253 --> 41:28.470
Ha, ha, ha.

41:29.682 --> 41:31.123
I think you should keep that on top.

41:37.628 --> 41:40.895
- Our brothers and our
sisters in the norther clan,

41:43.112 --> 41:44.112
they're gone.

41:47.886 --> 41:49.219
Remember them daily.

41:50.292 --> 41:51.630
Their struggles

41:52.605 --> 41:53.605
as ours

41:54.753 --> 41:56.886
are not worth any less in death.

41:57.456 --> 41:59.379
There is one survivor.

42:00.878 --> 42:01.878
A boy.

42:02.792 --> 42:04.326
And the Becks have him.

42:10.722 --> 42:12.189
We will take him back.

42:15.503 --> 42:16.636
We will show them

42:17.878 --> 42:21.278
that we can penetrate their forces.
They will know

42:22.128 --> 42:25.535
that soon the
observatory will be ours.

42:25.559 --> 42:27.714
- Yes!
- That is our right.

42:28.105 --> 42:29.682
This is our time!

42:30.308 --> 42:31.308
-Yeah!

42:31.331 --> 42:32.619
- And we...
- Yes!

42:32.644 --> 42:34.285
-We will survive!

42:34.310 --> 42:36.668
- Yeah!
- We'll take them out!

42:36.692 --> 42:38.692
- Take them out!
- Yeah!

42:38.716 --> 42:40.716
- Take them out!
- Yeah!

42:40.740 --> 42:42.740
-Yeah!

42:46.021 --> 42:47.021
-Morning.

42:54.717 --> 42:55.850
-It's been quiet.

43:02.451 --> 43:03.882
-Milo.

43:08.499 --> 43:09.565
-It's vitamin C.

43:10.179 --> 43:12.109
It'll keep the... the scurvy from

43:12.132 --> 43:13.670
pulling the skin off your arms.

43:14.421 --> 43:16.154
-I know what vitamin C is.

43:27.286 --> 43:28.286
-Where's David?

43:28.450 --> 43:30.930
- David is in the dome trying
to get satellite phone to work.

43:31.388 --> 43:33.694
He's been at it all night.
What's your excuse?

43:38.841 --> 43:39.841
-Hands.

43:46.544 --> 43:48.677
-Go ahead and give me your hand.

43:53.700 --> 43:55.767
-We are grateful for this food,

43:56.036 --> 43:57.836
for the work of many hands,

43:58.570 --> 44:00.170
and the sharing of life.

44:00.726 --> 44:03.929
We are the power that
make this table whole.

44:04.742 --> 44:05.864
-Family.

44:05.888 --> 44:07.571
Honor. Health.

44:25.080 --> 44:26.080
-Boy,

44:27.729 --> 44:30.062
we're all pleased
to have you here

44:31.010 --> 44:34.277
and we want to express our
regrets for your loss.

44:34.745 --> 44:36.345
You will always be safe.

44:36.369 --> 44:38.814
We will feed for you and care for you.
Do you understand?

44:53.509 --> 44:55.345
-Yes, thank you.

45:02.617 --> 45:04.017
-Do you have any idea

45:04.336 --> 45:06.936
how much trouble you're gonna cause us?

45:13.356 --> 45:14.489
I'm just kidding.

45:14.941 --> 45:17.603
Come on, you can at least
tell us your name. I mean, the Farnwells

45:17.627 --> 45:19.124
still name their kids, right?

45:19.149 --> 45:21.730
- He acts like he's some
kind of prisoner of war.

45:21.754 --> 45:24.183
-Oh, come on, kid. This isn't a gulag.

45:26.185 --> 45:27.185
-A... a what?

45:27.380 --> 45:29.247
-A gulag, a prison war camp.

45:30.498 --> 45:32.458
I read about it on one
of David's history books

45:32.483 --> 45:35.638
last winter before I
burned it for fuel. He was pissed.

45:35.842 --> 45:38.641
- Oh, well, reading's
overrated anyway. So...

45:38.665 --> 45:41.232
- Not if you want to learn
a word like gulag.

45:41.256 --> 45:43.544
It's definitely not. Is it?

45:43.904 --> 45:45.743
- Okay.
- Uh-huh.

45:46.451 --> 45:47.451
-Cristo.

45:49.162 --> 45:50.362
My name is Cristo.

45:52.373 --> 45:54.506
Everyone in our clan has a name.

45:55.552 --> 45:57.019
-Good to know, Cristo.

45:59.969 --> 46:00.969
Take this.

46:01.766 --> 46:02.766
You're skinny.

46:34.489 --> 46:37.356
- Your personal vendetta
puts us all at risk.

46:37.504 --> 46:39.704
-So this is about me, now, is it?

46:39.729 --> 46:42.811
- The boy is safe. You're
not saving anyone.

46:42.835 --> 46:44.835
-Did Lucas tell you that, did he?

46:47.034 --> 46:48.167
We all want this.

46:49.510 --> 46:51.376
-I know you promised to gas them out,

46:51.799 --> 46:53.359
they'll have no
means to survive.

46:53.384 --> 46:56.269
- Well my concern is my
people, not the Becks.

46:56.737 --> 46:58.015
-So they'll die!

47:00.565 --> 47:02.331
-Yeah, very soon.

47:05.815 --> 47:08.159
-Then hear this. They found something

47:09.385 --> 47:11.713
that may save all of us.
It's buried beneath the ice

47:11.737 --> 47:15.559
and if you attack, you may destroy
any chance we have of surviving.

47:15.768 --> 47:17.301
All of us, as a people.

47:18.057 --> 47:19.724
-So what have they found?

47:21.229 --> 47:22.229
-Lucas

47:22.815 --> 47:24.814
called it a... a jet plane.

47:26.471 --> 47:28.124
He said their was a president on it.

47:34.151 --> 47:36.084
-Do not undermine my efforts.

47:37.156 --> 47:39.823
There is more to this than just revenge.

47:49.013 --> 47:50.146
-They lied to us.

47:52.239 --> 47:54.373
- Who?
- The military commanders.

47:54.708 --> 47:56.395
Hell, everyone, even the president.

47:57.966 --> 47:59.692
They were predicting an ice age.

48:00.153 --> 48:02.680
They knew the comet was
going to change our orbit.

48:02.903 --> 48:03.903
-David.

48:04.567 --> 48:06.721
Those people on the plane,
did you know any of them?

48:07.513 --> 48:08.513
-Yes, I did.

48:12.450 --> 48:13.450
The pilot.

48:15.427 --> 48:16.893
Colonel Charles Moore.

48:19.395 --> 48:21.062
When I first met Charlie,

48:22.349 --> 48:23.882
we called him Dr. Doom.

48:24.958 --> 48:27.693
His first big assignment was
on Mayock's doomsday jet.

48:27.717 --> 48:29.926
We all hated going up on that thing.

48:30.638 --> 48:33.238
Preempted strikes,
retaliation strikes,

48:36.256 --> 48:37.656
didn't really matter.

48:38.803 --> 48:41.858
Because you knew when you were landing
you were a stranger in a strange land.

48:42.983 --> 48:45.983
I was on my way up here when Charlie
took off with the president.

48:46.514 --> 48:47.714
He wished me luck.

48:49.975 --> 48:52.375
And here I am after all these years.

48:53.014 --> 48:54.014
Alive.

48:58.857 --> 49:02.661
And I didn't even have the decency to
step into the cockpit yesterday.

49:04.881 --> 49:06.681
-We need to do this, David.

49:07.099 --> 49:10.266
- There's a good chance we will
kill ourselves. Do you know that?

49:10.842 --> 49:12.442
And I can't be that guy.

49:13.459 --> 49:15.489
The one who screws up again.
- David...

49:15.529 --> 49:18.703
- No. Listen, you don't understand.
You don't remember.

49:19.162 --> 49:20.495
You were just a kid.

49:21.131 --> 49:24.536
I had my a shot of saving humanity
twenty-seven years ago.

49:25.176 --> 49:26.176
I screwed up.

49:26.201 --> 49:30.013
- You tried to shoot down a comet with a
rocket that was built for a moon launch.

49:30.185 --> 49:33.881
It's like lobbying a grenade at a fire jet.
You blame yourself for missing?

49:34.068 --> 49:35.068
-Yeah, I do.

49:35.982 --> 49:38.440
I live with it every day
of my life and I should.

49:38.465 --> 49:40.037
-We're not gonna screw this up.

49:40.888 --> 49:43.912
- Lucas, we don't even have the football.
-What do you mean football?

49:43.937 --> 49:46.083
It's a briefcase. It's
got the army codes in it.

49:46.108 --> 49:48.694
Even if I could get the satellite
phone talking to the silos,

49:48.718 --> 49:50.802
we can't detonate without those codes.

49:56.092 --> 49:58.421
- Did they say how long
the freeze will last?

49:59.802 --> 50:00.802
-Indefinitely.

50:33.199 --> 50:34.199
-Um...

50:34.450 --> 50:35.450
you smell good.

50:36.239 --> 50:39.431
- Oh, you've been up all night.
- Hmm.

50:43.528 --> 50:46.995
- Temperature in the fish
tank shouldn't be below 54.

50:49.232 --> 50:50.298
-What is it now?

50:51.669 --> 50:52.669
-52.

50:56.060 --> 50:58.726
-I'll fix the heat panel in the morning.

50:59.732 --> 51:01.932
-Mary was always good about that.

51:02.200 --> 51:04.534
Keeping the temperature just right.

51:08.310 --> 51:09.575
I'm sorry.

51:12.052 --> 51:13.385
I broke our promise.

51:15.942 --> 51:16.942
-It's alright.

51:17.786 --> 51:19.816
Just... Mary was just
so good with the fish.

51:21.309 --> 51:23.443
Even when she was a little girl.

51:25.153 --> 51:26.438
-Yes, any animal, really.

51:28.489 --> 51:30.787
And we couldn't call them fish
when we ate them, remember?

51:31.645 --> 51:32.645
-That's right.

51:34.208 --> 51:35.208
I remember.

51:37.388 --> 51:38.388
-Rita.

51:42.099 --> 51:43.432
She's still with us.

51:46.115 --> 51:47.115
Right here.

51:47.755 --> 51:48.755
-I know.

51:50.427 --> 51:51.627
-And we have Milo.

52:09.119 --> 52:11.551
- Where's Sam?
- Out on night watch.

52:12.885 --> 52:14.418
-You're staying inside.

52:17.659 --> 52:18.659
Go!

53:26.516 --> 53:28.035
-I don't want them to take me.

53:28.641 --> 53:29.841
-I won't let them.

54:59.926 --> 55:01.182
No!

55:02.833 --> 55:03.833
No!

55:11.379 --> 55:14.069
- What have you done to this boy?
He fights me!

55:14.754 --> 55:17.346
-We've made him feel welcome!

55:17.786 --> 55:22.081
- Still saving the world one
stray at a time, Veena.

55:23.957 --> 55:25.704
Hey, stay down!

55:27.020 --> 55:28.353
Or I will hurt you.

55:34.724 --> 55:36.099
-No!

55:58.084 --> 55:59.411
-Open the door!

56:23.555 --> 56:24.947
-What? No 'thank you'?

56:25.251 --> 56:27.125
How about 'where the hell have you been'?

57:04.873 --> 57:05.873
-Climb!

57:10.514 --> 57:12.560
-Grab the rope, kid.

57:16.772 --> 57:18.814
I got you. I'm swimming.

57:20.514 --> 57:21.781
-Give me your hand!

57:22.858 --> 57:23.858
-No, Remy!

57:31.099 --> 57:33.511
Don't let go, Remy!
Don't let go!

57:34.786 --> 57:37.169
- Don't do it! The
ledge is too far!

57:37.560 --> 57:40.275
Don't do it! Remy, you'll never make it!

57:40.299 --> 57:42.864
-No!! No!!

57:55.079 --> 57:57.357
- It's all here.
- Yes, but he saw everything.

57:57.806 --> 58:00.073
- He's dead.
- Don't count on that.

58:02.509 --> 58:03.509
-Veena.

58:06.118 --> 58:07.718
I'm sorry about the boy.

58:14.235 --> 58:16.445
- We're going back in the jet.
We need the football.

58:16.470 --> 58:17.954
- I understand that.

58:41.210 --> 58:43.841
- The northern clan.
- There's nothing there.

58:44.686 --> 58:46.089
-In the ice mine.

58:46.616 --> 58:47.816
There was a plane,

58:48.061 --> 58:51.311
and the plane has a briefcase,
it's called the football.

58:51.980 --> 58:54.266
Find it. Bring it to me.

59:16.187 --> 59:18.120
-We're looking for a soldier.

59:19.116 --> 59:21.394
The football should be
attached to his wrist.

59:46.850 --> 59:48.001
-Damn it.

01:00:06.679 --> 01:00:08.012
-What are you doing?

01:00:12.202 --> 01:00:13.608
-I don't know. That's good.

01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:15.776
Come on, try it.

01:00:24.186 --> 01:00:25.186
-Hmm.

01:00:26.358 --> 01:00:28.225
It tastes sweet, like honey.

01:00:28.647 --> 01:00:31.847
The man who makes this is
a general in the army.

01:00:31.999 --> 01:00:32.999
Mills.

01:00:37.858 --> 01:00:38.858
-That's it.

01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:42.057
That's the door to the cockpit.

01:00:55.950 --> 01:00:56.950
-Okay.

01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:08.784
-Nothing in here.

01:04:47.393 --> 01:04:49.212
-We gotta get out of here! Now!

01:04:49.236 --> 01:04:51.236
It's collapsing!

01:04:53.736 --> 01:04:54.736
-Look out!

01:04:55.338 --> 01:04:56.338
Milo!!

01:04:57.018 --> 01:04:58.018
Veena!!

01:04:59.721 --> 01:05:01.248
Look out, Rick!!

01:05:01.272 --> 01:05:03.272
- Let's go!!
- I'm okay, I'm coming.

01:05:08.877 --> 01:05:10.243
-Where's Milo?

01:05:11.994 --> 01:05:14.927
Veena, where's Milo?
- I don't know!

01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:17.393
-Milo!

01:05:17.417 --> 01:05:19.417
-I'm right here. Let's go!

01:05:20.213 --> 01:05:21.213
-Come on!

01:05:23.439 --> 01:05:26.073
Come on! We gotta get out of here.
- Come on!

01:05:26.127 --> 01:05:27.660
We can't hold the door!

01:05:28.619 --> 01:05:31.257
- Let's go!
- Let's go, let's go!

01:05:31.281 --> 01:05:33.822
-Hold on, we're coming! We're coming!

01:05:37.387 --> 01:05:38.387
-Milo!

01:05:39.059 --> 01:05:40.059
Veena!

01:05:47.314 --> 01:05:48.617
-Where's the ax?

01:05:54.064 --> 01:05:55.064
-So the boy

01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:57.533
has been reunited with his aunt.

01:05:57.884 --> 01:05:59.977
-Was it worth the blood we spilled?

01:06:00.001 --> 01:06:02.078
- If I have his loyalty,
well worth it.

01:06:11.705 --> 01:06:13.639
You made me very proud today.

01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:15.240
-Thank you, father.

01:06:21.198 --> 01:06:23.198
-If you ever need something...

01:06:27.961 --> 01:06:30.894
- I saw the equipment
they took from the jet.

01:06:31.312 --> 01:06:33.579
I don't know what it's capable of.

01:06:34.171 --> 01:06:35.838
Just as I know that Lucas

01:06:36.625 --> 01:06:40.161
and William do not have the
unity or the resolve to use it.

01:06:41.203 --> 01:06:42.203
I do.

01:06:42.734 --> 01:06:45.124
- What exactly is he capable of?
- Power

01:06:46.039 --> 01:06:48.534
like you can never imagine.

01:06:49.921 --> 01:06:50.921
Heat.

01:06:51.210 --> 01:06:53.001
Warmth at last.

01:06:53.486 --> 01:06:56.955
I'm going back into the observatory
and I'm gonna take it all.

01:06:56.980 --> 01:07:00.395
- You don't have the resources.
Louis and Ignacio are gone.

01:07:00.419 --> 01:07:03.135
- I have enough men if you
tell me your secret.

01:07:06.405 --> 01:07:08.748
Lucas told you how to
circumvent the defenses.

01:07:08.772 --> 01:07:10.161
-You had me followed?

01:07:11.342 --> 01:07:13.230
-When I was at the Nordel clan,

01:07:14.350 --> 01:07:15.417
You visited him.

01:07:16.874 --> 01:07:21.497
You see, I know the smell
of a warm stone room.

01:07:22.413 --> 01:07:24.813
Especially one that used to be mine.

01:07:27.108 --> 01:07:29.875
You tell me how to get in and
out and no one gets hurt.

01:07:32.171 --> 01:07:34.719
Otherwise, blood will be spilled.

01:07:39.483 --> 01:07:41.418
That is the cost

01:07:42.772 --> 01:07:44.403
and it's on your head.

01:07:46.944 --> 01:07:48.601
There's just no time for waiting.

01:07:49.874 --> 01:07:51.384
We live or die by this moment.

01:08:08.421 --> 01:08:09.960
-I can track it from the surface.

01:08:09.985 --> 01:08:11.811
- That's a subterranean river.
Anything in it's gonna

01:08:11.836 --> 01:08:13.546
follow the glacial float until
we get to the flat lines.

01:08:13.571 --> 01:08:16.496
-Look for uplifts in the ice. That's the
only chance the jet has to surface.

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:19.111
-Now listen to me. The
fuselage is air tight.

01:08:19.135 --> 01:08:21.559
Right now they're alive.
They're alive.

01:08:21.582 --> 01:08:23.582
Now go. Go!

01:08:35.551 --> 01:08:36.551
-Milo!

01:08:37.573 --> 01:08:38.573
Milo!

01:08:56.412 --> 01:08:57.879
-Where are the others?

01:09:06.216 --> 01:09:07.216
-Milo?

01:09:35.997 --> 01:09:38.973
-Sam, how are we gonna find them out in
this storm? They're not gonna make it.

01:09:38.997 --> 01:09:39.868
-Don't say that.

01:09:39.894 --> 01:09:42.482
-Now, come on. Look at it out there.
What chance do they have?

01:09:42.506 --> 01:09:45.639
-Do you think that your wife
Mary would have given up?

01:09:46.091 --> 01:09:47.091
Huh?

01:09:48.091 --> 01:09:50.232
Her own son?
-She gave up when she died.

01:09:50.256 --> 01:09:52.256
-She never gave up
and never will you.

01:09:56.772 --> 01:09:59.330
I remember when Milo was born.

01:10:01.584 --> 01:10:03.800
You wouldn't let anybody
touch him but her.

01:10:05.162 --> 01:10:08.442
You two would lay there in
the bed in the middle of you

01:10:08.466 --> 01:10:11.761
one heart beating together.
You remember that, right?

01:10:13.652 --> 01:10:15.052
That's what you said.

01:10:16.667 --> 01:10:17.667
One heart.

01:10:20.972 --> 01:10:23.505
That's why you're never gonna give up.

01:10:24.324 --> 01:10:25.723
Not on Milo.

01:10:26.855 --> 01:10:29.655
That's why you won't
give up on any of us.

01:10:33.222 --> 01:10:34.222
-Okay.

01:10:38.308 --> 01:10:39.308
Okay.

01:11:13.441 --> 01:11:15.041
-We have a conversation.

01:11:18.465 --> 01:11:21.331
The satellite phone is
talking to the silos.

01:11:23.261 --> 01:11:25.409
-I've only been scared
a handful of times in my life

01:11:25.433 --> 01:11:27.433
and I gotta tell you.
This terrifies me.

01:11:27.847 --> 01:11:29.433
-You don't think I'm scared?

01:11:30.574 --> 01:11:32.641
I can't sleep, I haven't eaten,

01:11:33.488 --> 01:11:35.555
I've got to get this one right.

01:11:36.371 --> 01:11:38.504
What choice do we have, William?

01:11:39.847 --> 01:11:40.847
-Kovita!

01:11:41.707 --> 01:11:43.040
Kovi, where are you?

01:11:48.535 --> 01:11:50.827
Oh my God. Water.

01:11:51.754 --> 01:11:52.754
There's a leak.

01:11:57.039 --> 01:12:00.923
-I was so scared.
-Oh, me too. Now come on.

01:12:00.947 --> 01:12:02.612
We gotta find some place safe.

01:12:07.513 --> 01:12:09.077
Go quick! It's right here.

01:12:14.364 --> 01:12:16.964
-We're gonna die, aren't we?
-No, we're not.

01:12:18.286 --> 01:12:20.168
Eat this. The calories
will keep you warm.

01:12:20.513 --> 01:12:23.032
-What's the point?
-To stay alive!

01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:27.724
Look, we can survive this thing.

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:34.552
-Just please, keep telling me that,
Milo, because I can't imagine how.

01:12:34.576 --> 01:12:36.669
-You can start by eating the centers.

01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:55.030
Kovita!

01:13:01.835 --> 01:13:02.835
Kovita!

01:13:03.194 --> 01:13:04.194
Come on!

01:13:07.264 --> 01:13:09.971
No, no, no...breathe. Breathe breathe

01:13:10.913 --> 01:13:11.913
Come on!

01:13:12.085 --> 01:13:13.085
Breathe!

01:13:20.652 --> 01:13:23.519
-You didn't have to
take the kids with you.

01:13:23.542 --> 01:13:26.433
-Fred, don't.
-No, I will say whatever I feel.

01:13:26.753 --> 01:13:28.553
My daughter is on that jet.

01:13:28.675 --> 01:13:30.342
You were responsible for her!

01:13:30.367 --> 01:13:33.096
-Are you forgetting that my
grandson is out there on that jet too?

01:13:33.183 --> 01:13:34.649
-Lucas will save them.

01:13:35.554 --> 01:13:39.377
-He's one man on the ice with Sam.
They don't stand much of a chance.

01:13:41.249 --> 01:13:42.249
-Hell!

01:13:42.663 --> 01:13:44.530
-So you're giving up on him.

01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:47.509
Should my sons just quit and
come home, it's all a waste?

01:13:47.726 --> 01:13:50.463
They're efforts are hopeless, all
of our plans, the football...

01:13:50.796 --> 01:13:54.147
Why don't we just turn over the observatory
to the Farnwell while we're at it, Fred?

01:13:54.171 --> 01:13:56.171
Why fight for anything?
-Wait?

01:13:56.195 --> 01:13:58.725
-No, no, no...he needs to hear this.
he needs to feel this.

01:13:58.968 --> 01:14:00.768
My boys will never give up.

01:14:00.991 --> 01:14:03.327
I'm gonna go outside right now.
I'm gonna take my ship.

01:14:03.351 --> 01:14:05.351
if the Farnwells attack, then
I'll do what I've always done.

01:14:05.375 --> 01:14:08.264
I will protect our home, my
family, everyone of you.

01:14:08.289 --> 01:14:10.694
Yes, you, too, Fred,
I would die for you.

01:14:11.890 --> 01:14:13.290
Would you die for me?

01:14:28.216 --> 01:14:31.032
-We got to get moving before the
jet gets too far ahead of us.

01:14:32.458 --> 01:14:34.591
-Which way do you think east is?

01:14:36.825 --> 01:14:37.956
-Come on!  Breathe!

01:14:42.497 --> 01:14:44.584
Come on! Come on!

01:14:50.036 --> 01:14:51.036
Breathe.

01:15:47.818 --> 01:15:48.818
Sam!

01:15:49.131 --> 01:15:50.131
-Where?
-There.

01:15:50.349 --> 01:15:52.951
-Please tell me I'm okay!

01:15:53.389 --> 01:15:54.789
-You're totally fine.

01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:57.880
You're just tired, and
hungry, and...and thirsty

01:15:57.904 --> 01:15:59.451
and exhausted.

01:16:04.801 --> 01:16:06.201
-Why are you smiling?

01:16:07.106 --> 01:16:08.306
-You gotta get up.

01:16:09.512 --> 01:16:11.640
Come on. It's okay.

01:16:19.093 --> 01:16:20.093
We're okay.

01:16:20.765 --> 01:16:22.098
We're gonna make it.

01:16:26.490 --> 01:16:30.724
-Well, I think I'm gonna have to take it
off at the Metatarsus phalangeal joint.

01:16:30.749 --> 01:16:31.638
-Meaning?

01:16:31.663 --> 01:16:34.328
-The...uh...joint closest
to the forefoot here.

01:16:34.788 --> 01:16:36.560
Mama, I'm sorry.

01:16:37.014 --> 01:16:39.481
-Veena, you did everything you could.

01:16:39.725 --> 01:16:43.014
Diabetes is a merciless disease
under these conditions.

01:16:43.038 --> 01:16:45.038
-I want you to bite down on this.

01:16:45.561 --> 01:16:47.028
Be quick to cauterize.

01:17:48.015 --> 01:17:52.509
-Remy! You have no idea what
you're dealing with here!

01:17:52.534 --> 01:17:54.867
-I'm not taking anything
that isn't rightfully mine.

01:17:55.992 --> 01:17:58.467
You found this under my village.
-She'll kill him!

01:17:58.625 --> 01:18:01.328
-Oh, my people can move.
We'll be far away.

01:18:01.657 --> 01:18:04.968
But you, here in the observatory,
how safe will you be?

01:18:08.974 --> 01:18:10.249
Wanna stop me?

01:18:17.466 --> 01:18:19.104
You have five seconds.

01:18:19.128 --> 01:18:21.128
Make your move or
I'll make it for you.

01:18:25.470 --> 01:18:26.470
-Oh, David.

01:18:26.829 --> 01:18:28.415
You taught me to box.

01:18:28.806 --> 01:18:29.806
Did you forget?

01:18:30.688 --> 01:18:36.044
And the kids would laugh, when you
would flake me with that jab-like cross.

01:18:51.723 --> 01:18:54.003
-David, I've got the two
extra batteries for you.

01:18:55.137 --> 01:18:56.137
David!

01:18:59.231 --> 01:19:00.231
David?

01:19:04.997 --> 01:19:07.690
David! Hey, hey!

01:19:08.463 --> 01:19:10.640
-He got it all.

01:19:11.184 --> 01:19:13.651
I'm sorry, William. I'm so, so sorry.

01:19:20.505 --> 01:19:21.705
-I have a question.

01:19:23.391 --> 01:19:25.499
How did Remy know how to
open and unlock the shield?

01:19:27.274 --> 01:19:28.274
-Amalie.

01:19:30.087 --> 01:19:31.087
She was here.

01:19:31.555 --> 01:19:34.203
Two nights ago. She knew how
to bypass our defenses.

01:19:34.321 --> 01:19:36.141
-You knew this and said nothing?

01:19:36.196 --> 01:19:37.982
-Hey, she told Remy.

01:19:38.204 --> 01:19:39.804
-No.
-Why wouldn't she?

01:19:39.899 --> 01:19:42.313
She's your sister.
-She loves Lucas.

01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:45.024
-You think Remy wouldn't find
a way to get that from her?

01:19:45.251 --> 01:19:46.869
-She betrayed my son's trust.

01:19:47.079 --> 01:19:48.516
-We have to go after him.

01:19:48.618 --> 01:19:50.860
-And leave the observatory unprotected?
I don't think so.

01:19:50.884 --> 01:19:52.836
-So you would wait for
Lucas and Sam to return?

01:19:52.861 --> 01:19:55.099
-And you have that little faith
in their ability to do so?

01:19:55.123 --> 01:19:57.313
-I'm realistic.
-So I guess that also means you've

01:19:57.337 --> 01:19:58.508
given up on your daughter?

01:19:59.930 --> 01:20:02.264
-I haven't given up on any of them.

01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:04.780
-You listen to me, Fred.

01:20:06.024 --> 01:20:07.491
They're gonna make it.

01:20:07.907 --> 01:20:11.084
They're gonna survive. they're coming back.
You will see your daughter again.

01:20:12.524 --> 01:20:14.993
But the hardest thing
I'll ever do is explain

01:20:15.018 --> 01:20:17.218
to my son that it was
the woman he loves

01:20:18.102 --> 01:20:19.302
that betrayed him.

01:20:36.267 --> 01:20:38.238
-Keep, keep your eyes open.
Keep your eyes open.

01:20:38.423 --> 01:20:39.423
Hey, hey.

01:20:41.517 --> 01:20:42.517
Keep them up.

01:20:44.205 --> 01:20:45.338
Don't close them.

01:20:47.548 --> 01:20:49.158
-I love you, Milo.

01:20:52.736 --> 01:20:53.869
-I love you, too.

01:20:54.619 --> 01:20:55.619
-Love...

01:20:55.970 --> 01:20:59.435
I mean I would've spent every
last day of my life with you.

01:21:03.701 --> 01:21:04.701
-I know.

01:21:05.365 --> 01:21:06.365
Me too.

01:21:35.210 --> 01:21:36.210
-Right there.

01:21:37.663 --> 01:21:38.663
Right there!

01:22:14.489 --> 01:22:15.976
-Alright.
-No.

01:22:21.505 --> 01:22:22.505
-Kovita?

01:22:23.364 --> 01:22:24.364
-Milo!

01:22:25.513 --> 01:22:27.983
Milo!
-Kovita!

01:22:32.036 --> 01:22:33.036
-Milo!

01:22:33.614 --> 01:22:34.614
-Milo?

01:23:12.207 --> 01:23:13.207
-Sam?

01:23:14.254 --> 01:23:15.254
Sam!

01:23:19.902 --> 01:23:21.291
-Now we have our chance.

01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:34.456
-We still need to find the football.

01:23:36.410 --> 01:23:38.277
-I think I know where it is.

01:23:42.230 --> 01:23:43.822
It was right here.

01:23:55.751 --> 01:23:57.706
-They must have been
following us the whole time.

01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:02.735
-We're gonna be moving fast.
-I'm ready.

01:24:02.759 --> 01:24:04.618
-I know you are.

01:24:04.665 --> 01:24:06.935
-You gotta come and see this!

01:24:22.919 --> 01:24:25.252
The earth is recapturing its orbit.

01:24:25.276 --> 01:24:27.754
-The tremors. It's
all because of this.

01:24:29.552 --> 01:24:31.285
-We're saved.
-We'll see.

01:24:32.067 --> 01:24:34.467
-The Farnwells Know nothing of this.

01:24:35.786 --> 01:24:36.988
They'll have the army codes.

01:24:38.294 --> 01:24:39.427
They'll use them.

01:24:53.134 --> 01:24:54.134
Father.

01:24:56.298 --> 01:24:59.089
We're not going with you.
-Everything's changing.

01:24:59.361 --> 01:25:03.161
It's five degrees warmer here and
down there, who knows?

01:25:03.290 --> 01:25:05.224
-We can go farther than ever.

01:25:05.353 --> 01:25:07.420
There's a corridor to the east.

01:25:07.443 --> 01:25:08.944
Just think of the potential.

01:25:09.361 --> 01:25:12.294
The resources we might find!
-for how long?

01:25:13.048 --> 01:25:16.063
-As long as it takes.
-And what if all of this doesn't last

01:25:16.087 --> 01:25:18.287
and the freeze returns
down to the Great Plains?

01:25:18.548 --> 01:25:20.415
How will you get back to us?

01:25:20.657 --> 01:25:22.791
-Father, I will always find you.

01:25:26.978 --> 01:25:27.978
I'd have to.

01:25:53.902 --> 01:25:55.102
-We'll be alright.
