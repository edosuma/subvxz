00:12.178 --> 00:15.181
[Alexa] For the past six months,
everyone had been taking care of me,

00:15.265 --> 00:17.642
so Thanksgiving was my chance
to thank them...

00:18.393 --> 00:21.688
by cooking dinner all by myself.

00:22.897 --> 00:24.566
Which, of course, includes Katie.

00:25.817 --> 00:27.152
Happy Thanksgiving, Tom.

00:27.235 --> 00:29.487
Dinner is gonna be perfect.

00:29.571 --> 00:31.906
I know he doesn't have a head,
but I think he heard me.

00:32.449 --> 00:33.283
Hm.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.702
OK, let's do this, Tom.

00:35.785 --> 00:36.828
That's his butt.

00:38.538 --> 00:39.998
I think he still heard me.

00:40.999 --> 00:42.917
My schedule is going perfectly.

00:43.001 --> 00:44.878
Dinner is at four o'clock, sharp.

00:44.961 --> 00:46.755
Hey, any time on your schedule

00:46.838 --> 00:49.758
to finally answer my question
about why you said no to Dylan?

00:49.841 --> 00:51.718
Hm. Let's see.

00:51.801 --> 00:55.013
"Green beans, pumpkin pie, stuffing."

00:55.597 --> 00:57.807
No "Dylan." Sorry.

00:57.891 --> 01:00.185
Hey, I respect your privacy,

01:00.268 --> 01:02.145
but Tom needs answers.

01:03.021 --> 01:06.107
OK, Tom. I'll say it just this once.

01:06.191 --> 01:09.152
Dylan only asked me to the dance
because he feels sorry for me.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.280
-I don't think--
-This is a private conversation, Katie.

01:16.910 --> 01:17.911
Hey, guys.

01:18.495 --> 01:19.913
You're up early.

01:19.996 --> 01:21.247
I went to get coffee.

01:23.208 --> 01:24.959
Oh, another coffee in the trash.

01:25.043 --> 01:28.338
Looks like another fail with the new
barista who's way too cool for you.

01:28.421 --> 01:30.298
Th-The who? The what?

01:30.882 --> 01:34.302
I don't know what you're talking about.
You really think she's too cool for me?

01:34.385 --> 01:36.346
[stammers] Of course not!

01:36.971 --> 01:38.097
But also yes.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.184
What happened?

01:41.768 --> 01:43.770
I ordered my drink and she gave it to me.

01:43.853 --> 01:45.188
And then she said, "Next."

01:45.271 --> 01:47.315
She's horrible!

01:49.526 --> 01:52.195
Whoa! Katie, your hair's really coming in.

01:52.278 --> 01:53.613
Looks good.

01:53.696 --> 01:54.739
Thanks!

01:55.240 --> 01:58.618
-I'll never be too cool, just FYI.
-[cell phone chimes]

02:00.829 --> 02:04.207
Ooh, my dad's on his way!
I can't wait. It's been so long.

02:04.916 --> 02:06.835
[sighs] I wonder what he'll think of me.

02:07.335 --> 02:09.629
Ah, what am I saying?
He'll be so impressed.

02:09.712 --> 02:12.215
I mean, I'm making Thanksgiving dinner!

02:12.632 --> 02:13.466
Are you?

02:15.301 --> 02:18.054
Oh, yes, I am.
Peel, peel, and now I have to go.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.849
But I'll be back
to help you do this all by yourself.

02:24.018 --> 02:26.271
All right, are we ready to do this thing?

02:26.354 --> 02:28.898
Nope. You said you would let me
do all the cooking.

02:29.524 --> 02:31.693
Oh. I thought "me" meant "we."

02:32.986 --> 02:35.405
I want to make sure
you're not taking on too much, honey.

02:35.488 --> 02:36.489
Right.

02:36.573 --> 02:40.326
Not because you hate the idea of
someone else cooking Thanksgiving dinner?

02:40.410 --> 02:41.870
No! No!

02:41.953 --> 02:44.831
Don't be ridiculous. No. Here.

02:44.914 --> 02:45.915
Thanks.

02:46.624 --> 02:50.211
-Mom, you have to let go.
-I-I want to, I just don't want to.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.088
I'm trying to do a nice thing
for everybody.

02:52.171 --> 02:54.340
[sighs] And that's so sweet of you and...

02:54.424 --> 02:55.633
you are so strong!

02:57.010 --> 02:58.219
J-Just let go!

02:58.887 --> 03:00.305
OK, fine!

03:00.388 --> 03:01.639
Fine.

03:01.723 --> 03:03.933
I'm just gonna let you know
that when Grandma gets here

03:04.017 --> 03:06.436
she's gonna come in
and try to tell you how to do everything.

03:06.519 --> 03:09.772
One year, I had her wallpaper the bathroom
just to keep her out of the kitchen.

03:10.481 --> 03:12.692
Yeah, Grandma and I aren't like that.

03:13.276 --> 03:15.862
OK. Just let me know if you need anything.

03:19.073 --> 03:20.199
Do you need anything?

03:21.075 --> 03:22.076
I've got this.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.579
-[car door closes]
-All right. Oh, that's your dad.

03:24.662 --> 03:26.748
He went back to the store
to get a few extra things.

03:33.546 --> 03:35.298
-Fine. All right.
-Yeah.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.055
-Dad?
-Yeah?

03:42.722 --> 03:44.682
Dad, you know
there are only ten of us, right?

03:44.766 --> 03:46.392
Right, ten of us.

03:46.476 --> 03:47.769
Well, and a week of leftovers.

03:48.311 --> 03:50.271
Leftovers don't just happen.

03:50.355 --> 03:51.356
How do you not know...

03:52.106 --> 03:53.191
How does she not know that?

03:54.317 --> 03:56.903
-I always triple the recipes.
-Triple?

03:56.986 --> 03:59.072
You know how your dad is
about Thanksgiving.

03:59.155 --> 04:00.490
Thanksgiving!

04:02.200 --> 04:03.243
Wow.

04:03.326 --> 04:05.370
-I'll go get the rest.
-The rest?

04:06.120 --> 04:07.121
[Alexa sighs]

04:07.205 --> 04:11.501
OK. I'll just multiply by three
and push back dinner 30 minutes.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.294
Dinner is now at 4:30.

04:52.208 --> 04:54.794
Last month he was in the Congo,
saving elephants,

04:54.877 --> 04:58.089
and now he's in Mexico,
saving leatherback turtles.

04:58.172 --> 05:00.800
Well, I saved that hamster
from behind the dryer.

05:02.593 --> 05:03.928
I'm more of a quiet hero.

05:06.014 --> 05:08.433
So much has happened
over the last two years.

05:08.516 --> 05:10.226
Our phone calls are so short.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.980
I just can't wait
to have a real conversation with him.

05:14.564 --> 05:16.482
You know,
your dad's not gonna be here that long.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.318
Don't put too much pressure on the visit.

05:18.818 --> 05:20.528
I gave your brother the same speech.

05:20.611 --> 05:23.740
This is going to be the best visit
with Dad ever!

05:24.866 --> 05:26.075
May not have sunk in.

05:27.577 --> 05:30.621
Dad always brings a surprise.
Do you think it will be a snake?

05:30.705 --> 05:31.748
Oh, I bet it's a snake.

05:31.831 --> 05:34.334
-It's got to be a snake!
-It's not going to be a snake.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.127
It better not be a snake.

05:36.210 --> 05:37.211
[knocking]

05:37.295 --> 05:38.588
I'll get it!

05:41.591 --> 05:42.592
[whirring]

05:44.302 --> 05:46.179
That's so cool!

05:48.264 --> 05:49.515
-Ahh!
-Lower bridge!

05:52.685 --> 05:54.395
-Hi, guys!
-Dad!

05:54.896 --> 05:55.980
[Robbie grunts]

05:56.064 --> 05:57.106
Wait a minute.

05:57.190 --> 06:01.110
Excuse me, sir, have you seen my son,
Jack? A little squirt, about this big.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.737
It's me! I've grown!

06:03.237 --> 06:04.238
[clears throat]

06:04.322 --> 06:06.032
[deep voice] My voice is getting deeper

06:06.115 --> 06:08.493
and I can fit four fish sticks
in my mouth at once!

06:08.576 --> 06:10.369
Sounds like a challenge to me.

06:10.453 --> 06:12.246
-Hi, Dad!
-Hi, Booger.

06:13.039 --> 06:14.040
[both grunt]

06:14.373 --> 06:15.541
Wow, you did shave your head.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.960
Yeah, yeah,
but it's really coming back in.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.797
But Alexa doesn't have any yet,
because of the chemo.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.091
That's rough. You're a really good friend.

06:23.591 --> 06:26.469
-Can I make a wish?
-Oh, that's not really a th--

06:26.552 --> 06:29.597
My wish came true!
I have two amazing kids!

06:29.680 --> 06:32.058
Poof! Here we are!

06:34.102 --> 06:37.355
-Hey, Jennifer. You look good.
-Thanks. You've really let yourself go.

06:40.399 --> 06:43.903
So, tell me something, short stack,
do you still like really awesome gifts?

06:44.529 --> 06:46.531
The drone, the drone, the drone...

06:46.614 --> 06:48.157
Because I got you...

06:48.241 --> 06:49.700
underwear!

06:49.784 --> 06:50.618
Underwear?

06:52.370 --> 06:54.872
-Unless you would rather have the drone?
-Oh, yes!

06:54.956 --> 06:56.958
Take it out back.
I'll be out there in a minute.

06:58.334 --> 06:59.794
OK, I've got to get next door.

06:59.877 --> 07:01.671
Cowboys game is about to start.

07:01.754 --> 07:04.132
They've lost every time
I've missed opening kick-off.

07:04.215 --> 07:06.509
Ah, you're the reason
they're having a good year.

07:06.592 --> 07:08.886
Let's just say I'm a piece of the puzzle.

07:09.679 --> 07:10.680
[Katie chuckles]

07:12.723 --> 07:14.350
So, what's been going on, Booger?

07:14.934 --> 07:17.019
Oh, uh... Well, school's good.

07:17.103 --> 07:20.189
Uh... Oh, I tried out for basketball.
And I was Juliet!

07:20.273 --> 07:22.233
-I sent you the link last week.
-That's awesome!

07:22.316 --> 07:24.527
I've been so busy,
but I can't wait to check it out.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.154
Oh.

07:26.237 --> 07:29.574
Oh, um, that's OK.
You can watch it on my laptop.

07:29.657 --> 07:31.617
Just like Shakespeare intended.

07:32.368 --> 07:33.744
I can't wait to see it.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.705
Hey, don't you like presents, too?

07:36.456 --> 07:38.499
-You remembered!
-Close your eyes.

07:42.170 --> 07:43.337
[grunts]

07:45.756 --> 07:47.341
Surprise!

07:47.884 --> 07:48.801
Oh!

07:49.302 --> 07:51.471
I-Is that a Barbie Dreamhouse?

07:51.554 --> 07:53.764
Yes! You asked me for one.

07:54.348 --> 07:57.185
Yeah, I-I did, but a while back.

07:57.268 --> 07:58.352
It has an elevator

07:58.436 --> 07:59.437
and...

08:00.104 --> 08:01.272
[flushing]

08:01.355 --> 08:02.398
...a toilet.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.692
Take it easy in there, Ken.

08:04.775 --> 08:05.693
Whoa!

08:06.194 --> 08:07.487
Oh, um...

08:07.570 --> 08:09.739
-Thanks, Dad.
-You're welcome, Booger.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.824
No one really calls me that any more.

08:11.908 --> 08:14.118
I mean, I am in high school now.

08:14.202 --> 08:15.786
Well, you'll always be Booger to me.

08:16.370 --> 08:19.332
I should help Jack with the drone.
I still owe a couple of payments.

08:19.415 --> 08:21.626
-You want to come?
-Oh, maybe later.

08:21.709 --> 08:23.794
I'm helping make Thanksgiving dinner.

08:24.378 --> 08:25.421
Oh, sounds nice.

08:29.884 --> 08:32.220
OK, got the turkey buttered.

08:32.303 --> 08:33.554
How is it going, sweetie?

08:33.930 --> 08:35.389
-You may want to--
-Head chef.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.643
I love how we banter.

08:40.019 --> 08:41.020
OK.

08:42.730 --> 08:44.690
Got enough chairs for everybody.

08:44.774 --> 08:46.150
There's ten of us, right?

08:46.234 --> 08:49.320
Well, 11 if your parents
bring your brother, Corey.

08:49.403 --> 08:51.864
He's not coming, and he's not my brother.

08:51.948 --> 08:55.076
He's a 50-year-old parrot
who they once took to Europe.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.705
And when your mom
introduced me to your grandparents,

08:59.789 --> 09:02.375
I had to get Corey's approval,
which was a slam dunk.

09:02.458 --> 09:05.378
First thing he said to me was,
"Squawk! Hello, handsome!"

09:05.962 --> 09:08.005
It's the first thing
Corey and I agreed on.

09:10.633 --> 09:11.676
OK, yeah.

09:15.012 --> 09:16.138
[Lori sighs]

09:17.306 --> 09:18.140
Um...

09:18.641 --> 09:21.811
-Jen, we've got to move the couch.
-Oh, here, let me... let me help.

09:21.894 --> 09:23.020
[Jennifer clears throat]

09:25.773 --> 09:26.816
[Lori grunts]

09:26.899 --> 09:28.359
Can you get the TV?

09:31.612 --> 09:33.573
Oh, great, you're back!

09:33.656 --> 09:35.074
How is your dad?

09:36.117 --> 09:38.995
He bought me a Barbie Dreamhouse.

09:39.078 --> 09:40.162
Oh, that's...

09:41.330 --> 09:42.331
random.

09:42.415 --> 09:45.543
Yeah. Yeah, but you know what?
Let's just... Let's just do this.

09:45.626 --> 09:48.004
I am here to help.

09:48.087 --> 09:50.715
Ah. Well, we're right on schedule.

09:50.798 --> 09:52.675
Dinner is at five o'clock.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.051
Five o'clock?

09:54.802 --> 09:56.387
[whispers] There were promises made.

09:57.263 --> 09:58.598
Maybe I should go in there.

09:58.681 --> 09:59.682
[knocking]

09:59.765 --> 10:01.892
-Well, that's your mother.
-I am not my mother.

10:03.394 --> 10:04.729
No, your mom's at the door.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.526
Happy Thanksgiving!

10:10.610 --> 10:14.822
Oh, there's my sweet Lucas. You get more
handsome every time I see you.

10:15.823 --> 10:17.491
That seems to be the way it's going.

10:18.117 --> 10:21.621
-Mom, Dad, Happy Thanksgiving.
-Oh, you, too.

10:21.704 --> 10:24.790
I'm only sorry
we weren't allowed to bring Corey.

10:24.874 --> 10:28.377
I always hoped you and your brother
would be closer one day.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.631
Well, we uh live different lives,

10:31.714 --> 10:33.966
and um I've got my work and my family,

10:34.050 --> 10:35.343
and he's a bird.

10:38.012 --> 10:39.513
Oh, and there's Jennifer!

10:39.597 --> 10:41.599
Hey, Loretta, Sam. Cowboys game.

10:41.682 --> 10:43.768
Ah, yes. We know better, Jen.

10:43.851 --> 10:45.478
-We'll hug you at half-time, huh?
-Yep.

10:45.561 --> 10:48.814
And look, there's my lovely granddaughter!

10:48.898 --> 10:50.399
Hi, Grandma. Hi, Grandpa.

10:50.900 --> 10:53.778
And I know wherever Alexa is,
there's Katie!

10:54.111 --> 10:55.112
Aw!

10:55.196 --> 10:57.740
Be careful with the rosemary.
Nobody wants to eat stems.

10:57.823 --> 10:59.784
Hey, Grandma Loretta.

10:59.867 --> 11:00.701
Wait. No.

11:01.285 --> 11:03.204
They're making you do the cooking?

11:03.871 --> 11:05.247
You should be resting.

11:05.331 --> 11:07.208
Oh, do you think so, Loretta?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.877
Well, I guess Lori could take over.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.296
[sighs] Mom, please, OK?

11:12.797 --> 11:15.383
-I could do the green beans.
-Mom, please, OK?

11:16.717 --> 11:20.054
I'm in maintenance now, Grandma.
Feeling good, feeling strong!

11:20.137 --> 11:22.098
Katie and I got this. Now, everybody out.

11:22.181 --> 11:23.391
[Loretta] All right.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.022
Barbie Dreamhouse?

11:30.106 --> 11:31.690
-Katie!
-Whoa!

11:31.774 --> 11:32.858
Sorry!

11:34.860 --> 11:37.571
OK, time to get Tom in the oven.
Can you bring me the pan, please?

11:39.740 --> 11:41.117
[grunts] Tom is heavy.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.161
[Alexa grunts]

11:44.245 --> 11:47.164
-Can't he see that I'm not a kid any more?
-Katie! [yelps]

11:47.248 --> 11:49.708
[Katie] Oh, I got it!
I got it! Oh, no, no, no!

11:51.419 --> 11:52.711
[Alexa groans]

11:55.798 --> 11:57.425
[Katie groans]

11:58.300 --> 11:59.301
[whispers] OK.

12:00.636 --> 12:01.846
[Katie yells]

12:01.929 --> 12:04.598
-Oh! No, I got it. I got it. I got it.
-Oh, Katie!

12:04.682 --> 12:05.683
[Katie groans]

12:10.688 --> 12:11.730
OK.

12:11.814 --> 12:14.775
Just um... a quick wash

12:14.859 --> 12:16.485
and re-butter and season.

12:17.278 --> 12:18.737
OK, everyone, update:

12:18.821 --> 12:20.489
dinner's at 5:30.

12:21.115 --> 12:23.451
-I got those little...
-Tell that to my stomach.

12:33.711 --> 12:34.712
[sighs]

12:38.466 --> 12:39.467
Um...

12:40.634 --> 12:41.469
Dad?

12:42.136 --> 12:43.471
-Hey.
-Ah!

12:43.554 --> 12:44.805
Didn't mean to scare you.

12:44.889 --> 12:47.099
I'm in the middle
of an intense game of hide-and-seek.

12:47.183 --> 12:50.144
Oh, still uh playing with Jack.

12:50.227 --> 12:53.564
I better be, or I'm just crammed
in the closet like an idiot.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.777
Uh... Well, while I've got you here,
maybe... maybe we could catch up?

12:58.277 --> 12:59.153
Sure.

12:59.737 --> 13:02.656
So, you know about my play.

13:02.740 --> 13:05.618
You know, that was great.
Started out a little bumpy.

13:05.701 --> 13:06.535
Yeah?

13:06.619 --> 13:09.747
Yeah, all the theater kids ignored me
in the beginning.

13:09.830 --> 13:11.624
I know what that feels like.

13:12.416 --> 13:13.417
You do?

13:13.501 --> 13:16.504
Well, some of my co-workers
have been ignoring me.

13:17.922 --> 13:20.382
But maybe it's because
all my co-workers are turtles.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.303
Dad, I was trying to have
a real conversation.

13:24.386 --> 13:26.096
I was just having fun.

13:26.180 --> 13:28.140
Not everything has to be fun all the time.

13:28.224 --> 13:30.226
Not with that attitude, Booger.

13:31.435 --> 13:33.729
[Jack] Dad, I'm gonna find you!

13:33.812 --> 13:36.440
I cannot let that happen. Got to hide.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.153
Of course you do.

13:43.364 --> 13:45.115
You've always been great at hiding.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.167
[Jack] Ready or not, here I come!

13:57.711 --> 13:58.712
Dad?

13:59.922 --> 14:00.923
Dad?

14:01.757 --> 14:03.384
Oh, I know where you are.

14:04.343 --> 14:06.303
I am really good at this!

14:11.600 --> 14:13.227
You're having a good game.

14:13.894 --> 14:15.563
It's all about the can placement.

14:16.146 --> 14:17.231
-I'll take that.
-Wait!

14:17.314 --> 14:20.150
-[commentator] The kick is up...
-Yes, it's good!

14:20.234 --> 14:21.360
OK, go ahead, Loretta.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.992
How's it going, sweetie?

14:28.075 --> 14:29.869
I'm good, Grandma.

14:29.952 --> 14:32.746
OK, I'm just going to check the turkey.

14:33.622 --> 14:35.666
Do you think the oven is warm enough?

14:35.749 --> 14:38.210
It cools down
when people keep opening the oven.

14:38.961 --> 14:39.962
Oh.

14:40.045 --> 14:42.047
Has your mother been in here?

14:42.131 --> 14:43.549
[whispers] She's such a meddler.

14:45.467 --> 14:49.972
You need to tell her
that this is your kitchen.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.687
-How's it going, sweetie?
-Oh, killing it! Yeah.

14:56.770 --> 14:59.523
You know, right on schedule for 6:45.

15:00.441 --> 15:02.401
Six forty-five?

15:02.484 --> 15:05.946
I know. And she's using
the grapefruit knife to cut an apple.

15:06.780 --> 15:09.408
I haven't eaten since Tuesday
to make room for today.

15:10.242 --> 15:12.870
But the main thing is
Alexa's happy and hungry.

15:12.953 --> 15:14.663
-Happy and healthy.
-That's what I said.

15:20.085 --> 15:21.420
Hey, Lucas.

15:21.503 --> 15:22.630
Hey, Grandpa.

15:23.797 --> 15:27.009
-So, girl problems?
-How did you know?

15:27.092 --> 15:28.427
[Sam chuckles]

15:28.510 --> 15:30.054
It's always girl problems.

15:30.554 --> 15:31.931
You feel like talking about it?

15:33.390 --> 15:34.767
She works at Wired.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.686
I get all tongue-tied
when I try to talk to her.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.939
Yesterday, I ordered a la-la-la-latte.

15:41.231 --> 15:43.984
That makes me think of the first time
I saw your grandma.

15:44.068 --> 15:47.237
The most beautiful woman I'd ever seen.
She was getting on a bus.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.823
I knew if I didn't do something,
I'd never see her again.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.200
What did you do?

15:51.283 --> 15:53.327
So, I'm standing there like an idiot,

15:53.410 --> 15:55.663
when the door closes
and the driver starts taking off.

15:55.746 --> 15:56.997
So what else could I do?

15:57.748 --> 15:59.375
I threw myself in front of the bus.

16:00.376 --> 16:01.335
Whoa.

16:02.169 --> 16:04.922
-That's insane.
-Oh, yes, it was.

16:05.422 --> 16:07.925
But I got your grandma's phone number.

16:08.550 --> 16:10.094
And a couple of broken ribs.

16:11.345 --> 16:12.513
Best moment of my life.

16:12.596 --> 16:15.516
I tell you, I would have fought an army
for one smile from her.

16:16.600 --> 16:17.851
What's stopping you?

16:18.519 --> 16:20.604
My mom won't let me
have caffeine after two.

16:26.694 --> 16:28.028
We're going for coffee.

16:28.112 --> 16:29.571
But it's 4:15.

16:29.655 --> 16:33.450
Sometimes a man has to step up
and drink caffeine after two, Mom.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.037
OK, let's go.

16:38.163 --> 16:39.581
Oh, no!

16:39.665 --> 16:41.250
-Problem with the turkey?
-No!

16:42.126 --> 16:45.337
No problem. We're...
We're right on track for...

16:46.880 --> 16:48.173
seven o'clock.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.092
[Dave and Lori chuckle]

16:50.884 --> 16:53.095
I have had one Tic Tac today. One!

16:53.846 --> 16:54.930
I should go in there.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.808
Just promise me there will be gravy.
I love gravy.

16:57.891 --> 16:59.685
Don't be jealous. I can love you both.

17:01.729 --> 17:02.730
[Alexa humming]

17:02.813 --> 17:04.064
Gah! Grandma!

17:04.565 --> 17:06.859
Sweetie, did you blanche
the Brussels sprouts?

17:06.942 --> 17:09.278
Oh, you know,
I actually don't need to, Grandma.

17:09.361 --> 17:10.946
But you don't want them to burn.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.948
Oh, I'm just following the recipe.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.159
And I'm following 50 years in the kitchen.

17:16.326 --> 17:18.412
Do I... Do I look like that?

17:19.788 --> 17:20.789
Uh...

17:21.498 --> 17:22.958
Um... Uh...

17:23.042 --> 17:24.126
Oh, God!

17:24.626 --> 17:27.463
-Oh! I should go in there.
-Wait, you're going to cook?

17:27.963 --> 17:29.757
No, I'm going to rescue our daughter.

17:32.176 --> 17:34.011
You know, we're all gonna go for a walk.

17:34.094 --> 17:37.473
That is a good idea. I'm going to stay
here with Alexa and help her cook.

17:37.556 --> 17:39.933
Actually, Mom, you know, I was thinking,

17:40.017 --> 17:44.354
you know, it would give me a great
opportunity to FaceTime with Corey.

17:44.938 --> 17:48.150
Really? Oh, I can't tell you
how happy that makes me!

17:48.233 --> 17:50.360
He's staying with my friend, Rita.

17:51.403 --> 17:52.738
[mouths] Thank you.

17:54.865 --> 17:55.866
[TV blares]

17:55.949 --> 17:58.035
We're all going for a walk, Jennifer.

17:58.118 --> 17:59.453
That sounds like a family thing.

17:59.536 --> 18:02.498
-We're all going for a walk, Jennifer!
-OK, let's walk.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.085
Rita, can you put Corey on?

18:06.668 --> 18:09.254
Corey, have I got a surprise for you!

18:11.131 --> 18:12.466
Hi, Corey!

18:13.467 --> 18:16.053
It's me... your sister.

18:16.136 --> 18:17.971
[Corey squawks]

18:19.014 --> 18:20.474
Hey, Corey.

18:20.974 --> 18:22.601
[Corey] Hello, handsome!

18:24.394 --> 18:26.105
Honey, the house is all yours.

18:26.897 --> 18:28.065
Gravy!

18:30.901 --> 18:31.985
[door closes]

18:32.069 --> 18:34.446
Oh, no! I forgot about the green beans!

18:34.530 --> 18:35.739
[groans]

18:36.240 --> 18:37.241
OK.

18:37.741 --> 18:38.992
[clicking]

18:39.076 --> 18:39.910
OK.

18:41.662 --> 18:42.955
Stay calm.

18:43.455 --> 18:44.873
Stay calm.

18:46.041 --> 18:47.376
[yells] Where have you been?

18:48.335 --> 18:51.213
I'm just realizing I've outgrown my dad.

18:52.673 --> 18:53.674
Katie.

18:54.424 --> 18:55.759
Do you want to talk about it?

18:57.094 --> 18:58.387
-No.
-Good.

18:58.887 --> 19:00.639
Wait. No, not good.

19:01.306 --> 19:03.851
I'm sorry about your dad. You're awesome.

19:03.934 --> 19:06.353
-His loss.
-Thank you.

19:06.436 --> 19:08.021
-So, talk tonight?
-Mm-hm.

19:08.105 --> 19:09.648
I'm definitely not panicking.

19:10.440 --> 19:11.525
I need help!

19:11.608 --> 19:13.068
W-What can I do?

19:13.152 --> 19:14.361
I-I don't know.

19:14.444 --> 19:17.239
Half the side dishes are overcooked,
the others are undercooked,

19:17.322 --> 19:18.740
the turkey's not even close.

19:19.575 --> 19:21.326
What do you want from me?

19:22.202 --> 19:23.662
OK, OK, OK.

19:23.745 --> 19:26.540
Let's take a big chef breath. Yes.

19:26.623 --> 19:28.709
-[rattling]
-Whoa! What is that noise?

19:28.792 --> 19:30.127
Oh, that's the pressure cooker.

19:30.210 --> 19:32.421
We need to concentrate
on getting the stuffing ready.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.007
Are you sure that thing's OK?

19:41.972 --> 19:42.973
No!

19:44.266 --> 19:45.267
Oh...

19:45.350 --> 19:48.187
Why did I think I was ready to do this?

19:49.688 --> 19:51.565
OK. OK. OK.

19:51.648 --> 19:52.816
OK, it's bad.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.109
But the good news -

19:54.193 --> 19:55.694
it can't get any worse.

19:59.615 --> 20:02.034
I blew up Thanksgiving.

20:08.373 --> 20:09.583
I have an idea.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.336
Start scraping.

20:16.924 --> 20:18.091
[Alexa groans]

20:19.718 --> 20:20.719
Oh.

20:26.433 --> 20:29.102
There she is. Isn't she amazing?

20:31.688 --> 20:32.689
OK, then.

20:33.357 --> 20:34.775
Here's your moment, son.

20:35.859 --> 20:37.027
Go jump in front of that bus.

20:40.364 --> 20:41.865
-Yes?
-Hi.

20:45.035 --> 20:47.162
Can I have two la-la-la-la...

20:47.788 --> 20:48.914
iced coffees?

20:50.832 --> 20:51.833
Coming right up.

20:52.376 --> 20:53.377
Uh...

20:53.877 --> 20:55.295
Working on Thanksgiving, huh?

20:55.379 --> 20:56.421
Yeah.

20:56.505 --> 20:57.965
Yeah, yeah.

20:58.465 --> 21:01.885
Hey, so, did you know they killed
45 million turkeys just for today?

21:02.386 --> 21:04.554
I'm a vegan.

21:04.638 --> 21:06.473
Me, too!

21:06.974 --> 21:08.267
Except for hamburgers.

21:15.357 --> 21:16.984
You want her to like you, right?

21:18.360 --> 21:20.570
I just want to make sure
we're on the same page here.

21:21.697 --> 21:25.409
-Let's just get out of here.
-Hey, we paid. I'd like my coffee.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.869
-Here we go. Thank you, dear.
-Mm-hm.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.330
OK, can we just go now?

21:34.960 --> 21:35.961
OK.

21:37.045 --> 21:38.255
Oh, just one more thing.

21:40.590 --> 21:41.925
Hey! What was that for?

21:42.009 --> 21:43.010
I'm so...

21:43.093 --> 21:45.137
Oh, look what I've done to this shirt.

21:45.220 --> 21:47.514
I... How are we gonna get this... Oh!

21:48.015 --> 21:50.225
Wow. You got really soaked, huh?

21:50.851 --> 21:52.686
Yeah, I did.

21:53.812 --> 21:55.480
I think you can handle the rest.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.316
Cool sneakers.

21:57.899 --> 21:58.900
Thanks.

21:59.484 --> 22:01.737
Hey, any chance I can get your number?

22:02.988 --> 22:03.989
Sure.

22:10.704 --> 22:12.748
"Try again in three years."

22:13.749 --> 22:14.750
She likes me!

22:16.084 --> 22:19.212
-Thanks, Gramps.
-Hey, I've still got some moves.

22:28.555 --> 22:29.681
Whoa.

22:29.765 --> 22:33.643
Uh... You got a little something
right... everywhere.

22:35.270 --> 22:36.938
Yeah.

22:37.397 --> 22:41.068
Uh... I know you've been busy.
Have you had a chance to see your dad?

22:41.485 --> 22:42.360
Uh...

22:42.861 --> 22:44.029
Not really.

22:46.364 --> 22:48.200
I always thought he was so much fun.

22:49.409 --> 22:51.078
I didn't realize that's all he was.

22:52.412 --> 22:53.413
Yeah.

22:54.956 --> 22:56.625
He can be a big kid.

22:57.626 --> 22:59.586
But there is more to him than that.

23:00.170 --> 23:01.171
Like what?

23:01.963 --> 23:05.258
He's brave and he's a risk-taker.

23:06.718 --> 23:09.304
-Reminds me of somebody else I know.
-Who?

23:10.013 --> 23:12.390
Somebody who shaved her head
for her best friend.

23:13.016 --> 23:16.561
Who went out for the basketball team
when she didn't even know how to play.

23:16.645 --> 23:20.023
Who snuck out in the middle of the night
and climbed the town sign.

23:20.107 --> 23:22.484
Wow! I am out of control.

23:22.567 --> 23:23.568
[Jennifer laughs]

23:24.319 --> 23:25.987
And you get that from your dad.

23:27.614 --> 23:29.407
Try and keep the door open a little.

23:30.075 --> 23:32.661
Not for him, for... for you.

23:35.038 --> 23:36.414
-Thanks, Mom.
-[chuckles]

23:37.833 --> 23:39.751
OK, I'm gonna go take a shower.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.712
[groans] I think I have potato
in my belly button.

23:43.380 --> 23:45.090
Well, don't take long. I'm starving.

23:45.173 --> 23:46.925
Lori took us on a two-hour walk.

23:47.926 --> 23:49.678
It felt like a hostage situation.

23:50.971 --> 23:52.264
Except there was singing,

23:52.347 --> 23:53.807
and we saw a deer.

23:54.641 --> 23:55.642
Hm.

24:01.148 --> 24:03.775
[Ryan as Romeo]
...grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

24:04.151 --> 24:05.152
Dad?

24:06.403 --> 24:07.445
Is that my play?

24:09.781 --> 24:13.618
I'm sitting here watching this poised,
amazing, beautiful young woman...

24:14.161 --> 24:16.204
and I realize that's who you are now.

24:18.874 --> 24:19.958
You were right.

24:20.041 --> 24:21.459
I am good at hiding.

24:22.627 --> 24:24.921
My whole life,
I've been looking for adventure,

24:25.005 --> 24:26.965
but maybe I've also been running away.

24:29.134 --> 24:31.970
You're not setting me up
with another turtle joke, are you?

24:32.053 --> 24:33.805
No. No.

24:34.306 --> 24:35.432
This is real.

24:35.932 --> 24:38.518
It's just when I hear about things
I've missed, like your play,

24:38.602 --> 24:40.395
I feel terrible for not being around,

24:40.478 --> 24:43.398
which, I guess,
makes me not be around more.

24:44.399 --> 24:45.817
And that's so unfair to you.

24:47.569 --> 24:48.778
Yeah, it is.

24:49.362 --> 24:50.238
I'm sorry.

24:51.198 --> 24:54.659
If it's OK with you,
I'd like to work on this - us.

24:56.119 --> 24:57.120
I'd like that.

24:58.872 --> 25:00.081
You know what I hope?

25:01.499 --> 25:04.169
I hope someday I grow up
to be just like you.

25:05.086 --> 25:06.213
Thanks, Dad.

25:06.963 --> 25:08.298
And in the meantime...

25:09.132 --> 25:10.884
you can have my Barbie Dreamhouse.

25:17.098 --> 25:18.975
Wow. Dinner smells good.

25:23.647 --> 25:26.274
-Where are the mashed potatoes?
-Jack!

25:26.942 --> 25:28.652
And the stuffing!

25:29.319 --> 25:31.738
-And the Brussels sprouts.
-And the gravy.

25:36.785 --> 25:38.703
-I don't understand.
-[Sam] Oh, oh!

25:38.787 --> 25:40.622
Dinner is served!

25:42.832 --> 25:44.960
-Finally!
-All right! Whoo!

25:45.043 --> 25:46.253
I could cry.

25:46.836 --> 25:49.130
But I'm too weak
to push the tears out of my eyes.

25:51.299 --> 25:52.884
Well, don't get your hopes up.

25:52.968 --> 25:54.261
I'm sure it's terrific.

25:54.344 --> 25:57.264
And so what it took a little longer?
It gave us all time to chat.

25:57.347 --> 26:00.183
Well, that just looks fantastic!

26:00.267 --> 26:02.018
We haven't taken the lid off, Mom.

26:02.102 --> 26:03.395
I'm trying to create a buzz.

26:05.188 --> 26:06.439
Here goes.

26:10.735 --> 26:12.070
What the heck is that?

26:12.904 --> 26:15.115
I-I mean, what the heck is that?

26:15.615 --> 26:17.617
Y-You made it, so I love it.

26:19.202 --> 26:20.495
Oh!

26:20.996 --> 26:22.205
Oh, look!

26:22.706 --> 26:24.332
I see green stuff

26:24.416 --> 26:26.376
and uh... red stuff.

26:26.459 --> 26:27.294
Ooh.

26:29.129 --> 26:29.963
Hey!

26:30.046 --> 26:32.215
Uh... I see some turkey in there.

26:33.216 --> 26:35.260
I recognize turkey.

26:36.469 --> 26:38.596
Really, nobody has to eat this.

26:38.680 --> 26:41.182
I ate a worm once, so I'll eat anything.

26:41.266 --> 26:42.350
Awesome!

26:42.434 --> 26:44.644
In the Kalahari,
I had to drink my own pee.

26:46.813 --> 26:48.064
I'll switch to red wine.

26:52.152 --> 26:54.237
I really wanted to do this for you guys.

26:55.113 --> 26:57.282
To show how far I've come, you know?

26:57.949 --> 27:02.954
Honey, you being healthy automatically
makes this the best Thanksgiving ever.

27:03.038 --> 27:04.414
-Hear, hear.
-Yes, it does.

27:05.123 --> 27:06.416
Yeah, I guess.

27:10.086 --> 27:10.920
Hey.

27:11.713 --> 27:12.714
No way!

27:13.715 --> 27:14.716
Yes!

27:15.258 --> 27:16.760
I feel hair!

27:16.843 --> 27:18.928
K-Katie, look! Can you see hair?

27:20.180 --> 27:22.265
-Oh, my gosh! I see it!
-I have hair!

27:22.349 --> 27:24.726
Welcome back, guys!

27:24.809 --> 27:26.061
[Lori] Let me see! Let me see!

27:26.561 --> 27:29.522
Honey! Oh, it's beautiful!

27:29.606 --> 27:31.649
[Lucas] Lex, which side
are you gonna part it on?

27:31.733 --> 27:33.068
Oh, sweetie.

27:33.485 --> 27:36.321
Oh, it's soft, like a peach.
Sorry, I'm hungry.

27:36.404 --> 27:37.697
[Sam laughs]

27:37.781 --> 27:38.907
We're proud of you, kid.

27:39.407 --> 27:42.911
Look, your Uncle Corey's all excited, too!

27:42.994 --> 27:45.372
-[Corey squawking]
-Corey, isn't it wonderful?

27:46.414 --> 27:48.249
OK, now I'm ready to eat.

27:48.333 --> 27:49.334
[Dave] All right.

27:51.544 --> 27:52.629
OK.

28:01.096 --> 28:02.097
Wow.

28:03.181 --> 28:05.225
It's great. [sighs]

28:05.308 --> 28:07.435
Thanksgiving!

28:08.603 --> 28:09.771
Really?

28:09.854 --> 28:12.690
It's delicious. What recipe did you use?

28:12.774 --> 28:15.443
Oh, we improvised.

28:15.527 --> 28:18.071
I'd say it's pretty off-the-wall.

28:18.947 --> 28:19.781
[Dave gasps]

28:20.198 --> 28:21.241
Gravy!

28:21.324 --> 28:23.076
It was hidden inside!

28:28.790 --> 28:30.875
To hair and gravy.

28:31.584 --> 28:33.420
To hair and gravy!

28:33.503 --> 28:34.796
[Loretta] There we go.

28:34.879 --> 28:37.674
[Alexa] It was one of
the oddest toasts ever...

28:37.757 --> 28:39.634
but it summed up the day pretty nicely.

28:40.343 --> 28:45.181
It wasn't the perfect Thanksgiving, but...
maybe that's what was so perfect about it.
