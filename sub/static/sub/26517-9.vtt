Previously on
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...

00:03.351 --> 00:04.613
I had sex with your dad.What?

00:04.656 --> 00:05.788
And I was in a really low place,
like,

00:05.831 --> 00:07.137
the lowest place
I've ever been in my life.

00:07.181 --> 00:08.138
I can't believe that happened.
Why did you do that?

00:08.182 --> 00:10.532
Bert is in charge,
and that's that.

00:10.575 --> 00:12.055
I'm enjoying it
so much around here.

00:12.099 --> 00:13.796
I've just made a few changes.

00:13.839 --> 00:14.971
Maybe I can find you
some good people.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.146
A match.

00:16.190 --> 00:17.060
Check it out.

00:17.930 --> 00:19.541
Oh, my God, that's Jason.

00:19.584 --> 00:20.890
I've been on a date
with this guy.

00:20.933 --> 00:21.978
I still have
this guy's number.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.110
Maybe I'll text him back.

00:23.153 --> 00:24.981
I am going to get you
out of here.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.374
Probably be
able to do it

00:26.417 --> 00:27.462
before you do Cats.

00:27.505 --> 00:29.507
I would never do Cats.

00:29.551 --> 00:31.118
We should do Cats. Yeah.
Let's do Cats.

00:31.161 --> 00:33.337
Delightful.

Oh, I need to get laid.

04:31.662 --> 04:33.751
Yeah.

04:33.795 --> 04:35.579
GREG:
Hey, thanks for letting me

04:35.623 --> 04:37.189
crash at your place
while I figure things out.

04:37.233 --> 04:39.670
It's a little awkward
between me and my dad right now.

04:39.714 --> 04:41.324
Mm, yeah. Yeah,
that makes sense.

04:41.368 --> 04:42.673
He slept with your
ex-girlfriend.

04:42.717 --> 04:43.674
It's probably a
little complicated.

04:43.718 --> 04:45.676
Yeah.
It happens, I guess?

04:45.720 --> 04:48.157
No, it does not happen.
People's dads do not go to bars

04:48.200 --> 04:49.680
and take their son's
ex-girlfriend

04:49.724 --> 04:51.247
to their 50-and-over
retirement community...

04:51.291 --> 04:53.162
Okay, no details, please.
I don't like thinking about it.

04:53.205 --> 04:55.207
I'm trying hard
to take the high road.

04:55.251 --> 04:57.601
I mean, intellectually,
I understand how it happened.

04:57.645 --> 04:59.951
My dad and Rebecca were both
at their lowest point.

04:59.995 --> 05:02.476
I mean, she tried to commit
suicide and he hasn't had

05:02.519 --> 05:04.608
a drink since,
but I just can't get past it.

05:04.652 --> 05:07.132
It's super gross and upsetting.

05:07.176 --> 05:08.525
Yeah, yeah.

05:08.569 --> 05:10.353
Well, at least you only have
to get past it with him.

05:10.397 --> 05:13.661
You and Rebecca, that ship has
sailed and sunk, right?

05:13.704 --> 05:16.664
Right, right, right.
Yeah, obviously.You know what?

05:16.707 --> 05:19.362
You should do what I always do
if I'm feeling sad

05:19.406 --> 05:22.452
or happy or confused or tired...

05:22.496 --> 05:24.149
Work out

05:24.193 --> 05:25.890
Uh, cause you work out
constantly,

05:25.934 --> 05:27.631
and when you stir your coffee,

05:27.675 --> 05:29.241
about 80 different muscles
ripple.

05:29.285 --> 05:30.852
Oh, thank you. Feels amazing.

05:30.895 --> 05:32.680
I can only imagine
how good it looks.

05:32.723 --> 05:34.725
You know what? You want to
work out, I will hook you up.

05:34.769 --> 05:36.640
I can get you a free
one-month pass at my gym.

05:36.684 --> 05:38.686
Hmm. Not that generous an offer.

05:38.729 --> 05:40.949
There's literally a stack
of one-month passes on the bar.

05:40.992 --> 05:42.559
You saw those.

05:43.995 --> 05:45.562
REBECCA:
You know, spinning is the most

05:45.606 --> 05:46.868
efficient way to get in shape.

05:46.911 --> 05:48.522
It can burn up to
a thousand calories per class.

05:48.565 --> 05:51.263
That's why I'm taking
two classes a day.

05:51.307 --> 05:53.527
Two classes a day?
That's a little extreme.

05:53.570 --> 05:55.833
Even I don't do two classes
a day and look at me.

05:55.877 --> 05:57.922
I mean, look at me,
I'm so good at spinning.

05:57.966 --> 06:00.403
I'm trying to tone up to get
naked in front of strangers.

06:00.447 --> 06:02.449
What?
I got to get laid

06:02.492 --> 06:04.059
by someone
I haven't laid already.

06:04.102 --> 06:06.148
I got to stop
thinking about my exes,

06:06.191 --> 06:07.671
move on from those
same three people.

06:07.715 --> 06:09.107
Yeah, you need someone new.

06:09.151 --> 06:11.806
But please don't sleep
with my dad, Rebecca.

06:11.849 --> 06:13.329
Eh.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.548
Seriously. I need you to say it.

06:14.591 --> 06:16.854
Okay, I won't sleep with Jorge.

06:16.898 --> 06:18.290
Even though
he does have

06:18.334 --> 06:20.118
kind eyes
and a beautiful corazón.

06:21.337 --> 06:22.643
I'm kidding.

06:22.686 --> 06:24.688
God, I'm so sweaty.

06:24.732 --> 06:26.168
Well, maybe that's because
you work out

06:26.211 --> 06:28.866
in those cheap-ass heat-trapping
synthetic leggings?

06:28.910 --> 06:30.433
Well, you know what?
Spinning's expensive,

06:30.477 --> 06:32.696
and I've had a significant
downgrade in income recently.

06:32.740 --> 06:34.132
See: lawyer to pretzel maker.

06:34.176 --> 06:35.438
Mm.
So I have
to compromise.

06:35.482 --> 06:37.701
I got these babies
three for five dollars.

06:37.745 --> 06:39.877
Anyway, back to sexy time.

06:39.921 --> 06:42.184
So I have the perfect clean
slate sex candidate in mind:

06:42.227 --> 06:43.446
You remember
that guy Jason?

06:43.490 --> 06:45.187
I talked about him in New York?The one who

06:45.230 --> 06:46.928
canceled on you last minute?
That "I'm sick" excuse

06:46.971 --> 06:48.451
was clearly a lie.

06:48.495 --> 06:49.583
That's what I thought, too,
but then,

06:49.626 --> 06:51.149
he's actually been texting me,

06:51.193 --> 06:53.413
to try to prove he was sick.
Look at this picture.Ooh.

06:53.456 --> 06:57.112
Is that a selfie of him barfing?

06:57.155 --> 06:59.070
Yes. Yes, it is. And also,

06:59.114 --> 07:01.682
he sent me this one.

07:01.725 --> 07:04.206
Oh! That is several photos

07:04.249 --> 07:06.513
of him pooping
in a public trash can.

07:06.556 --> 07:08.645
He was trying to prove to me
that he wasn't lying.

07:08.689 --> 07:09.777
And when he sent me
these pictures,

07:09.820 --> 07:11.561
he said
"the proof is in the pudding."

07:11.605 --> 07:13.171
That's cute, right?

07:13.215 --> 07:15.217
We are such
very, very different people.

07:15.260 --> 07:16.261
:
Oh...

07:16.305 --> 07:18.699
Jason, you are nice, and single,

07:18.742 --> 07:20.657
and I know from our first date
with him a couple years ago

07:20.701 --> 07:21.832
that he's not a murderer.

07:21.876 --> 07:23.007
And that's what
I'm looking for right now:

07:23.051 --> 07:25.488
not my exes, not a murderer.

07:25.532 --> 07:27.011
Okay. Let's go.

07:27.055 --> 07:29.057
You know what? Actually, I'm
gonna stay for the next class.

07:29.100 --> 07:31.494
You know, these thighs are not
gonna un-jiggle themselves.

07:31.538 --> 07:32.669
So watch out, Valencia.

07:32.713 --> 07:34.497
Rebecca's getting her mojo back.

07:34.541 --> 07:35.498
Meow.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.326
Bye.
Bye.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.156
It's always hard to get
the feet in right.

07:41.199 --> 07:43.985
Oh, hello.

07:45.856 --> 07:47.641
♪

07:50.774 --> 07:52.863
Hey, all. Guess who's back!

07:52.907 --> 07:56.519
Whoa. Why is the conference
table out here?

07:56.563 --> 07:59.435
What happened? What, did some
millennial startup take over?

07:59.479 --> 08:00.610
Where is everyone?

08:02.003 --> 08:07.008
Oh, a party for me.
Oh, you guys are too much.

08:07.051 --> 08:09.314

08:11.621 --> 08:13.710

08:13.754 --> 08:15.843
Hey.Hey. How's the baby?

08:15.886 --> 08:17.061
Welcome back.Oh, she's good.

08:17.105 --> 08:18.672
Oh, look at all this.

08:18.715 --> 08:21.588
This is so nice. For me?

08:21.631 --> 08:22.763
Well...

08:22.806 --> 08:24.199
Um, actually...

08:24.242 --> 08:25.243
What's different about you?

08:25.287 --> 08:28.203
Why do you look
weaker?

08:28.246 --> 08:30.901
Oh, I know, it's your 'stache.
It's gone.

08:30.945 --> 08:32.120
Oh.

08:32.163 --> 08:33.730
Huh.
Aww.

08:33.774 --> 08:35.384
I'm growing it back.

08:35.427 --> 08:37.386
I just had a little
barbecue saucemergency.

08:37.429 --> 08:39.693
Or is it
a barbecue saucetastrophe?

08:39.736 --> 08:41.999
You mean a saucepocalypse?Mm-hmm.

08:42.043 --> 08:43.044
Shut your peach fuzz face,
he's coming.
Oh!

08:43.087 --> 08:45.089
Who's coming?Shh!

08:46.264 --> 08:48.745
ALL:
Happy Bert-day!

08:50.834 --> 08:52.662
Wow! Oh, my God.

08:52.706 --> 08:55.491
What It's birthday.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.624
No, it's Bert-day.

08:57.667 --> 08:59.364
Why do you keep saying it
like that

08:59.408 --> 09:04.718
No. And Bert-day is a party to
celebrate Bert's work-a-versary.

09:04.761 --> 09:06.676
How nice for Bert.

09:06.720 --> 09:08.896
Wow. And look at that
lustrous facial hair.

09:08.939 --> 09:11.942
Where'd you get
that idea

09:11.986 --> 09:13.553
From you, of course.

09:13.596 --> 09:15.816
Darryl, we are
so happy to see you.

09:15.859 --> 09:18.470
I wish you would have told us
that you were coming back today.

09:18.514 --> 09:19.863
We would've planned something.

09:19.907 --> 09:21.038
DARRYL:
Oh,

09:21.082 --> 09:22.823
that's so...Oh, you guys, before I forget,

09:22.866 --> 09:26.217
since we have the new conference
table, the old conference room

09:26.261 --> 09:28.480
is now gonna be
the ping-pong room.

09:28.524 --> 09:29.481
What?

09:29.525 --> 09:30.613
You got us something
on your day?

09:30.657 --> 09:32.136
The man just
doesn't stop giving.

09:32.180 --> 09:33.964
Yeah, it's fun.PAULA: Well,
happy Bert-day.

09:34.008 --> 09:35.792
Yeah, happy Bert-day.Bert...

09:35.836 --> 09:37.141
Oh! Come on, you guys.

09:37.185 --> 09:39.317
Oh. Sorry.
BERT:
This is so sweet of you.

09:47.717 --> 09:48.936
You have a good day back?

09:50.546 --> 09:53.505
I'm nice now.
I don't know if you heard that.

09:53.549 --> 09:54.898
It's a bummer
you came on Bert-day.

09:54.942 --> 09:56.291
Yeah, I wish I had known.

09:56.334 --> 09:58.336
Kind of disappointing.
But I'm okay.

09:58.380 --> 09:59.729
All right.
Glad to hear it.

09:59.773 --> 10:02.427
I'm sorry, I got to run.
I'm off to the gym.

10:03.820 --> 10:07.389
Did we do it? Do I need
to keep talking to you here?

10:07.432 --> 10:08.999
I'm still adjusting
to this whole

10:09.043 --> 10:10.827
being interested in others
thing.

10:10.871 --> 10:12.437
No, I'm fine.Okay.

10:12.481 --> 10:14.657
I'm fine.All right. Okay.

10:14.701 --> 10:16.006
Enjoy the rest of Bert-day.

10:16.050 --> 10:16.920
Sorry.

10:16.964 --> 10:18.922
Reflex.

10:27.235 --> 10:29.585
WHITE JOSH:
All right, man, all right.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.632
Here we go.Okay. So I just pick these up
and put them down

10:32.675 --> 10:35.635
and pick these up and put them
down, and that's how it works?

10:35.678 --> 10:37.462
No sarcasm. Greg. It's a gym.

10:37.506 --> 10:38.812
No one will understand
what you're saying.

10:38.855 --> 10:40.683
Okay.

10:40.727 --> 10:43.599
All right. I'm glad
you took me up on my offer.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.775
The gym is a drama-free zone,
so you're not gonna have to

10:45.819 --> 10:48.473
think about your dad
or about Rebecca

10:48.517 --> 10:50.998
or your dad with Rebecca--
quick question:

10:51.041 --> 10:52.739
was the oxygen tank
near the bed--

10:52.782 --> 10:54.044
don't answer that,
don't know why I asked.

10:54.088 --> 10:55.916
I'll see you at home.
Have fun, don't get hurt.

10:55.959 --> 10:57.221
Okay, well, unless I find out

10:57.265 --> 10:59.006
you also slept
with my dad, I'm fine.

10:59.049 --> 11:00.442
Oh, no. You heard?

11:00.485 --> 11:03.053
Go away. Get out of here.All right. See you later.

11:14.021 --> 11:15.675
REBECCA:
Wait, no way.

11:15.718 --> 11:18.286
You like Space Jam?
I loved Space Jamas a kid.

11:18.329 --> 11:20.288
Oh, I love it, too.
MJ was my hero.

11:20.331 --> 11:22.856
In elementary school, I wore
a Bulls hat every single day.

11:22.899 --> 11:25.162
He's the greatest player
of all time. Sorry, LeBron.

11:25.206 --> 11:26.598
Yeah, I don't care about
basketball, but I had

11:26.642 --> 11:28.078
such a crush
on Marvin the Martian.

11:28.122 --> 11:29.253
I mean, a man
who wears a skirt?

11:29.297 --> 11:32.126
Ugh, so secure, such a turn-on.

11:32.169 --> 11:33.910
You are such a weirdo.

11:33.954 --> 11:36.696
I'm the weirdo,
trash can pooper?

11:36.739 --> 11:38.045
Hey, I got applause.
There were a lot of people

11:38.088 --> 11:39.307
on the street that day.

11:44.529 --> 11:46.314

Stop ruining my vagina
like you ruined musicals!

13:05.393 --> 13:06.873
Thank you.

13:06.916 --> 13:10.093
Oh, but I want to have sex.

13:10.137 --> 13:13.009
This sucks more than the song
about what makes a Jellicle cat

13:13.053 --> 13:16.186
and then it just goes on to
describe literally any cat.

13:29.112 --> 13:30.722
You need the 40s?

13:30.766 --> 13:32.681
Oh, no, I'm not gonna need those
because I can't lift them

13:32.724 --> 13:33.900
'cause they're too heavy.

13:33.943 --> 13:35.902
You just getting back into it?

13:35.945 --> 13:38.513
Uh, yeah, I used to be way
into gym, but only gym class,

13:38.556 --> 13:40.123
and only on badminton day.

13:40.167 --> 13:41.690
Well, good on you for, uh,
hitting the gym again.

13:41.733 --> 13:42.952
You know what they say.

13:42.996 --> 13:45.346
The road to fitness
is one pound at a time.

13:45.389 --> 13:46.651
Hmm.But don't use
the one-pound weights.

13:46.695 --> 13:48.653
You'll embarrass yourself.

13:48.697 --> 13:50.655
I'm Nathaniel.Oh. Greg.

13:50.699 --> 13:51.874
That's gross.Yeah, sweaty.

13:51.918 --> 13:53.354
Why did we do that?I'm not sure.

13:53.397 --> 13:55.138
All right.

13:55.182 --> 13:56.400
Okay.

14:05.670 --> 14:08.021
I'm so sorry.
While I was in there,

14:08.064 --> 14:11.676
I checked my calendar
and I totally forgot

14:11.720 --> 14:13.026
that I have a business trip
tomorrow

14:13.069 --> 14:14.462
and my flight leaves

14:14.505 --> 14:15.767
uh, super early.

14:15.811 --> 14:17.421
Huh. What kind of business trip

14:17.465 --> 14:18.858
do you have in the pretzel biz?

14:18.901 --> 14:23.210
I got to go see my salt man
in Idaho.

14:23.253 --> 14:25.038
Idaho.

14:25.081 --> 14:26.474
Yeah, well,
'cause of the potatoes.

14:26.517 --> 14:29.346
That's also where
a lot of salt is centered.

14:29.390 --> 14:31.348
Oh. I get it.

14:31.392 --> 14:32.872
Oh, no. I know it seems
like I'm lying.

14:32.915 --> 14:35.178
It does. It really, really does.I'm really not, though.

14:35.222 --> 14:37.833
Look, um... three days. Just,

14:37.877 --> 14:39.182
let's set another date
in three days.

14:39.226 --> 14:40.488
I'm sure that's all it'll take

14:40.531 --> 14:42.620
to clear up my...
my salty business.

14:42.664 --> 14:43.839
Sound good?

14:43.883 --> 14:45.885
Great. It's a date.

14:45.928 --> 14:47.974
Great.

14:55.329 --> 14:57.592
Hey, Maya.

14:57.635 --> 14:59.202
How you doin', girl?

14:59.246 --> 15:01.726
Oh, you know me,
Just living.

15:01.770 --> 15:04.294
What do you say we hit
Spice Girls karaoke

15:04.338 --> 15:05.861
this Saturday

15:05.905 --> 15:08.124
I finally memorized
the rap in "Wannabe."

15:08.168 --> 15:09.996
I just listened to it
while I was sleeping.

15:10.039 --> 15:12.302
Oh, D

15:12.346 --> 15:13.303
What, are you busy?

15:13.347 --> 15:14.609
BERT:
Maya,

15:14.652 --> 15:16.393
I got that Rioja from "Ethpaña"

15:16.437 --> 15:19.353
you wanted for Wine with Whine
dinner on Saturday.

15:19.396 --> 15:20.615
Oh!Wine with what?

15:20.658 --> 15:22.486
Our Wine with Whine dinner.

15:22.530 --> 15:25.489
It's a weekly thing where we get
together, drink delicious vino

15:25.533 --> 15:27.665
and talk openly
about our work frustrations

15:27.709 --> 15:31.017
in front of our super
supportive superior, Bert.

15:31.060 --> 15:33.976
I wanted to call it Sipping With
Your Super Supportive Superior

15:34.020 --> 15:36.544
Saturday Soiree,
but Paula punched me.

15:36.587 --> 15:38.981
But Maya, if you do it every
week, you could skip it once

15:39.025 --> 15:41.288
to hang
with your good buddy Darryl.

15:41.331 --> 15:43.116
Bert, you wouldn't mind,
would you?

15:43.159 --> 15:44.552
Well, it's not up to me.

15:44.595 --> 15:46.075
It's up to this young lady
right here.

15:46.119 --> 15:47.598
And I think
she's old enough to choose

15:47.642 --> 15:49.644
who she wants
to spend her weekends with.

15:49.687 --> 15:50.862
Come on, M-Dog.

15:50.906 --> 15:53.300
What do you say?No pressure.

15:55.476 --> 15:56.433
Uh,

15:56.477 --> 15:58.479
uh...Come on.

16:00.916 --> 16:03.614
I don't want to disappoint
either of you.

16:03.658 --> 16:06.008
But I do love
Spice Girls karaoke night,

16:06.052 --> 16:08.750
and I kill that Ginger Spice
solo in "2 Become 1."

16:08.793 --> 16:11.753
But this week has been maj,
and I really need my Whine time.

16:11.796 --> 16:13.711
I got to go with Bert
and his Rioja.

16:13.755 --> 16:15.017
I'm so sorry.

16:15.061 --> 16:17.063
Oh. Okay.
No, that's totally fine.

16:17.106 --> 16:18.716
I get it.
I totally...

16:18.760 --> 16:20.327
:
I...

16:20.370 --> 16:22.068
Is it true?Oh, it's fantastic.

16:22.111 --> 16:23.852
It's a 2015...

16:27.377 --> 16:29.031
Ooh, it burns, it burns,
burns...

16:29.075 --> 16:31.033
Ah...

16:31.077 --> 16:33.079
JOSH: Got it!

16:35.124 --> 16:37.648
Oh, thank you for going
to the drugstore for me.

16:37.692 --> 16:38.998
I'm so uncomfortable,
I can barely walk.

16:39.041 --> 16:41.435
It's just chafe, chafe,
burn, burn.

16:41.478 --> 16:43.437
It's no problem.
I used to get this for Valencia.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.047
She said it was hand cream,
but I have two sisters,

16:45.091 --> 16:46.570
I know it's for foot fungus.

16:46.614 --> 16:49.008
Yeah. E-Exactly.

16:49.051 --> 16:51.358
My feet are so gross right now.

16:51.401 --> 16:53.838
That's why I'm, uh,
wearing socks.

16:56.276 --> 16:59.540
All right,
"results in one to seven days"?

16:59.583 --> 17:01.107
No, no, no, no.
My date's in three days.

17:01.150 --> 17:04.197
I need my... piggies to be
all healed up by then.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.459
You know what I do
when I get athlete's foot

17:05.502 --> 17:07.069
is I double down
on the healing treatments

17:07.113 --> 17:08.375
so I can get
back to karate.

17:08.418 --> 17:10.681
I spray, I soak,
I powder, I sun.

17:10.725 --> 17:12.074
Well, the sun part's
just because

17:12.118 --> 17:14.076
I like how my feet look tan.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.252
Double down.
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

17:16.296 --> 17:18.472
Can you go get me
another box of this?

17:18.515 --> 17:21.257
Sure.Great.

17:23.172 --> 17:26.045
Oh, God, that tastes
like chalky metal sand.

17:26.088 --> 17:28.612
Thanks for buying it
for me, I guess?

17:28.656 --> 17:31.093
Well, thanks for spotting me.
I mean, you did drop the bar

17:31.137 --> 17:33.922
on my chest a couple times, but
you're-you're getting better.

17:33.965 --> 17:35.228
Yeah, I got to say,
this whole working out thing's

17:35.271 --> 17:37.012
actually making me
feel a lot better.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.014
About what?
What's your damage, anyway?

17:39.058 --> 17:41.408
I mean, clearly you want to talk
about it and I'm nice now,

17:41.451 --> 17:44.106
so what's the matter?

17:44.150 --> 17:45.586
It's actually...
it's a long story.

17:45.629 --> 17:47.805
I-I had a weird thing
happen with an ex.

17:47.849 --> 17:49.285
You did? So did I.

17:49.329 --> 17:50.504
I mean, I don't know
if mine was weird

17:50.547 --> 17:54.203
as much as... devastating.

17:54.247 --> 17:56.075
Oh, no, mine was that, too.

17:56.118 --> 17:57.380
God.Women.

17:57.424 --> 18:00.601
Can't... say adages
about them anymore.

18:00.644 --> 18:02.037
No, you can't.Yeah.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.344
All right. See you.All right. Take care.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.915
Hey. Look at you,
a regular gym rat now.

18:10.959 --> 18:12.961
Yeah, I don't even know
how you could recognize me.

18:13.004 --> 18:14.223
I'm so damn fit.

18:14.267 --> 18:15.790
Hey, I'm kind
of digging

18:15.833 --> 18:18.140
this gym thing, and I think
I actually met a new friend.

18:18.184 --> 18:21.012
What? Come on.
See, gyms are great.

18:21.056 --> 18:22.362
Although do wash
your hands frequently

18:22.405 --> 18:23.798
and don't touch your face.

18:23.841 --> 18:25.713
Someone died from
a staph infection last year.

18:25.756 --> 18:28.194
Danny, engage your core!

18:28.237 --> 18:31.240
You know what? What are you
doing? Stop it, stop it.

18:31.284 --> 18:32.850
Oh...NATHANIEL:
Did I leave my towel out here?

18:32.894 --> 18:34.635
Oh, yeah. It's right here, bud.

18:34.678 --> 18:37.420
Oh, no, Danny. This is bad.

18:37.464 --> 18:39.422
All right, leg day tomorrow?Yeah. Ready to do it.

18:39.466 --> 18:41.294
Well, we'll see you then.I'm still sore
from the other day.

18:43.209 --> 18:44.123
See my new friend?

18:44.166 --> 18:46.777
Huh No. Nope.

18:46.821 --> 18:49.171
Me, Greg,
I made a new friend in town.

18:49.215 --> 18:51.042
I haven't done that
since kindergarten.

18:51.086 --> 18:52.174
Yeah.And it's all

18:52.218 --> 18:53.958
because of you.

18:54.002 --> 18:55.569
Awesome.

18:55.612 --> 18:57.223
Oh, no. What have I done?

19:02.402 --> 19:04.099
Oh, God.
Look at them.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.057
What is the big deal
about this friendship?

19:06.101 --> 19:08.886
You haven't stopped
talking about it for days.

19:08.930 --> 19:11.237
You don't understand. Nathaniel
just became a nice person.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.195
This could push him
straight back to doucheville.

19:13.239 --> 19:16.851
And Greg is sober now
and is very fragile

19:16.894 --> 19:18.461
after the whole Rebecca
with his dad thing.

19:18.505 --> 19:20.289
It's so hard
for both of them

19:20.333 --> 19:22.291
to make new guy friends.

19:22.335 --> 19:24.728
Straight people are so tragic.

19:24.772 --> 19:26.643
Babe, just introduce them.

19:26.687 --> 19:28.341
They're adults,
they'll understand.

19:28.384 --> 19:30.212
I know I should, but I can't.

19:30.256 --> 19:33.172
Look at them, they're
so happy together.

19:33.215 --> 19:34.782
Oh, God, they just think
they're regular friends.

19:34.825 --> 19:37.088
I can't, I can't do it.
I can't do anything.

19:37.132 --> 19:39.090
All I can do is just stand here,

19:39.134 --> 19:41.702
watching two trains
slowly collide.

19:45.271 --> 19:48.491
Mm. Looks nice in here.

19:48.535 --> 19:50.276
Yeah. Jason's picking me up,

19:50.319 --> 19:52.278
so I want the place
to look nice and tidy.

19:52.321 --> 19:55.455
Here you go, baby. Got you some
nice organic cotton leggings.

19:55.498 --> 19:56.891
Try those next time.

19:56.934 --> 19:58.414
Thank you.You feeling
any better down there?

19:58.458 --> 20:00.851
So much. I was in such
a hurry to get better,

20:00.895 --> 20:02.897
I kind of blitzkrieged
the entire infection.

20:02.940 --> 20:04.725
Mm-hmm.So not only did double ointment,

20:04.768 --> 20:06.248
but I also did
some home remedies

20:06.292 --> 20:07.554
like an apple cider
vinegar bath,

20:07.597 --> 20:09.295
I took the strongest probiotic
I could find,

20:09.338 --> 20:11.906
plus, I took an old antibiotic
from a sinus infection

20:11.949 --> 20:13.299
just in case.That's a lot.

20:13.342 --> 20:15.562
Yeah, so the itch is now gone.

20:15.605 --> 20:17.216
Oh, and I'm feeling so good.

20:17.259 --> 20:18.608
I'm really excited
to sleep with Jason

20:18.652 --> 20:20.871
and stop thinking
about my exes, you know?Mm-hmm.

20:24.788 --> 20:26.268
:
See? I feel nothing.

20:26.312 --> 20:28.314
["We Should Definitely Not
Have Sex Right Now" playing]

20:34.972 --> 20:36.713
Hey, V.

20:38.759 --> 20:41.457
Okay, I did feel a little twinge
of something on that.

20:41.501 --> 20:45.287
Oh, yeah, I felt it, too.
He's still Josh, but he fine.

20:45.331 --> 20:47.681
Mm, you're right.
You're right.

20:47.724 --> 20:51.685
Ugh, this underwear keeps
messing up the line of my dress.

20:51.728 --> 20:53.904
You know what?

20:53.948 --> 20:55.732
What are you doing?I'm not gonna be wearing
the dress for that long.

20:55.776 --> 20:56.994
Might as well, right?

20:59.388 --> 21:02.304
Girl, no.What's wrong?

21:02.348 --> 21:04.350
You need to ask yourself that.

21:04.393 --> 21:07.831
There is a terrible smell.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.311
And...

21:09.355 --> 21:11.226
Put 'em back on, put the
panties back on. Now, now, now!

21:11.270 --> 21:12.271
Okay.

21:12.314 --> 21:14.055
Oh, no.Mm-hmm.

21:14.098 --> 21:15.448
Oh, I smell it, too.Yep.

21:15.491 --> 21:17.145
Oh, that's...
Oh, that's bad.

21:17.188 --> 21:19.103
It smells worse than the
wedged-in plot device

21:19.147 --> 21:20.583
of the Heaviside Layer.

21:20.627 --> 21:22.846
Ju... Uh, coming, Jason.

21:24.370 --> 21:26.023
Oh. I thought you said,

21:26.067 --> 21:28.330
"Come in, Jason."

21:28.374 --> 21:29.331
Maybe he won't
notice.

21:29.375 --> 21:31.638
Wow, you look
beautiful.

21:31.681 --> 21:33.640
Oh, my God, thank you.

21:33.683 --> 21:35.598
Oh. I thought we were
going out for dinner.

21:35.642 --> 21:37.557
Did you make a
tuna casserole?

21:37.600 --> 21:40.342
Maybe. I-I'm just gonna
go to the bathroom.

21:40.386 --> 21:41.909
Valencia, will you please
entertain my guest

21:41.952 --> 21:43.432
and maybe open some windows?
Okay, thanks.

23:06.559 --> 23:08.387
Is-is that
what it is?

23:08.430 --> 23:10.911
No, it's not
a river fish.

23:10.954 --> 23:12.478
Can't put my
finger on it.

23:12.521 --> 23:13.783
Nor should you.

23:16.482 --> 23:18.484
If everyone could just
listen for a second.

23:18.527 --> 23:19.963
It's my time to whine.

23:20.007 --> 23:21.617
So, what people
don't understand is,

23:21.661 --> 23:23.358
I have very sensitive
finger skin.

23:23.402 --> 23:24.707
Oh.So, when I'm
filing documents--

23:24.751 --> 23:26.579
I'm very often
filing documents--

23:26.622 --> 23:27.971
it's a bloody mess.

23:28.015 --> 23:30.452
But then, I'm told by Paula

23:30.496 --> 23:32.106
that wearing gloves

23:32.149 --> 23:34.238
to file is "weird."

23:34.282 --> 23:36.066
No, no, no.
I never said that.

23:36.110 --> 23:37.981
I said it was "creepy."

23:38.025 --> 23:40.419
Then I asked if you were
gonna murder the papers

23:40.462 --> 23:42.421
because you looked
like a serial killer.

23:42.464 --> 23:43.944
You were just... He...
No, he was spurting bloodOh...

23:43.987 --> 23:45.249
all over the briefs.

23:45.293 --> 23:47.251
Spurt?George, if
you'd like gloves,

23:47.295 --> 23:48.775
I'll provide them
and Paula, you can pick

23:48.818 --> 23:51.342
a color that you find
festive and comforting.

23:51.386 --> 23:53.301
Fuchsia gloves
for George.

23:53.344 --> 23:54.998
Hooray! Thank you, Bert.

23:55.042 --> 23:57.174
Cheers, everyone.
Cheers.

23:57.218 --> 24:00.482
Oh, hey, guys.
I know you're having an event.

24:00.526 --> 24:03.267
I just came by with
a little something for everyone.

24:03.311 --> 24:05.052
Okay, here we go, rapid fire.

24:05.095 --> 24:07.837
Maya, rainbow
eye shadow palette.

24:07.881 --> 24:10.710
Jim, electronic drum pad.

24:10.753 --> 24:14.496
George, hot water bottle
shaped like a '40s pinup.

24:14.540 --> 24:16.455
Paula, lightweight merino shawl

24:16.498 --> 24:18.544
embroidered with butterflies.

24:18.587 --> 24:20.197
Oh!And Bert--

24:20.241 --> 24:21.982
I got you dirt.

24:22.025 --> 24:23.505
It's like a pet rock,

24:23.549 --> 24:25.420
but it's dirt.
Get it?

24:25.464 --> 24:27.770
Wow, thank you, Darryl.
I was looking for

24:27.814 --> 24:29.424
a playmate for my pet sand.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.557
Oh.Great, Darryl. Thanks.
But I've been

24:31.600 --> 24:33.428
sitting on my whine all night.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.038
I don't like the sandwich guy.

24:35.082 --> 24:36.300
Bread is wet,

24:36.344 --> 24:37.911
everything has mayo,
which is basically

24:37.954 --> 24:39.521
chicken embryo mucus
mixed with oil.

24:39.565 --> 24:43.090
I hear you, I understand,
and aioli want to help.

24:43.133 --> 24:44.526
Oh!Oh, good one, boss!

24:45.701 --> 24:48.095
Ah, yeah, but what
about the presents?

24:48.138 --> 24:49.488
We know what's inside.No, we know what's in it.

24:49.531 --> 24:50.445
Okay, okay.
Um, uh...

24:50.489 --> 24:52.186
How about this?
I'm taking...

24:52.229 --> 24:55.537
everyone to Disneyland!
Right now.

24:55.581 --> 24:56.582
Except for Bert, of course.

24:56.625 --> 24:58.018
You can eat ice cream,
you can stay up

24:58.061 --> 24:59.889
as late as you want,
I'll buy you any toy you want.

24:59.933 --> 25:01.630
No, a toy? Please.

25:01.674 --> 25:03.545
We are not children.

25:03.589 --> 25:06.069
Although I would love
a Moana, actually.DARRYL: Oh?

25:06.113 --> 25:08.550
She is gonna make
such an amazing chief someday.

25:08.594 --> 25:09.856
So, guys, come on.
Come with me.

25:09.899 --> 25:11.074
Darryl.Hmm?

25:11.118 --> 25:13.250
This is my event
and we're not done.

25:13.294 --> 25:14.861
Maybe you can
wait until

25:14.904 --> 25:16.515
it's your time.
This is my time.

25:16.558 --> 25:19.561
Trigger alert.

25:19.605 --> 25:21.389
I know what's going on here.

25:21.432 --> 25:23.086
My parents are divorced
and I was often

25:23.130 --> 25:24.740
a pawn in their conflict
and it was...

25:24.784 --> 25:26.220
sometimes kind of nice,

25:26.263 --> 25:29.571
because I got everything
I ever wanted.

25:29.615 --> 25:30.790
But nothing I needed.

25:30.833 --> 25:32.705
BERT:
He's right.

25:32.748 --> 25:34.620
Let's not fight
over these folks.

25:34.663 --> 25:37.797
These are good people and they
can care about both of us.

25:37.840 --> 25:40.234
Let's not force them
to make a choice.

25:40.277 --> 25:42.453
Good point.

25:42.497 --> 25:44.543
Him?
Disneyland?

25:44.586 --> 25:47.328
Well, it's an unfair one.Yeah, you know.
Oh, come on.

25:47.371 --> 25:50.287
Got to go see the mouse.Will you get on
the Impossibles coaster?

25:50.331 --> 25:51.724
MAYA: We need to go
in one car, though.

25:51.767 --> 25:53.421
My car is waiting right outside.GEORGE: It's outside?

25:53.464 --> 25:55.249
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.JIM: Oh, I can't wait
for some Mickey ears.

25:55.292 --> 25:57.599
I'm sorry, B-Dog.

25:57.643 --> 26:01.342
Call him a cute nickname again
and no turkey legs for you.

26:06.042 --> 26:08.131
Tonight I am alone.

26:08.175 --> 26:10.133
:
Esta noche estoy solo.

26:17.663 --> 26:19.012
REBECCA:
Sorry, I'm not feeling well.

26:19.055 --> 26:20.753
Valencia, can you show
Jason out, please?!

26:20.796 --> 26:23.059
All right, it's time
to move on.Wait, uh... Whoa.

26:23.103 --> 26:25.322
It's now that you're leaving.What?

26:25.366 --> 26:27.150
Bye!

26:27.194 --> 26:28.587
What about our date?

26:29.892 --> 26:33.722
Oh, Valencia.

26:33.766 --> 26:35.594
The cats are killing me.

26:35.637 --> 26:36.986
Which cats?

26:38.031 --> 26:40.033
Funky!

26:47.649 --> 26:49.216
So what do you do?

26:49.259 --> 26:50.913
Well, I'm about to finish
business school,

26:50.957 --> 26:52.393
but I'm, uh, I'm actually...

26:52.436 --> 26:54.656
You know,
I had this crazy idea--

26:54.700 --> 26:56.223
never even really told anyone--

26:56.266 --> 26:59.313
but my dad used to have this
restaurant out by the freeway

26:59.356 --> 27:00.662
and I'm thinking about
re-opening it

27:00.706 --> 27:02.664
as my thesis project.

27:02.708 --> 27:05.362
It was this great local
Italian restaurant

27:05.406 --> 27:07.103
and it got overrun
by all these chains,

27:07.147 --> 27:09.584
so I think it'd be
cool to revive it.NATHANIEL: Totally.

27:09.628 --> 27:10.933
What are you doing?Oh, my God!

27:10.977 --> 27:12.631
You scared me.

27:12.674 --> 27:14.981
Snuck up on me there.

27:15.024 --> 27:17.113
Just keeping an eye out.
Still very casual, don't worry.

27:17.157 --> 27:19.725
Oh, I'm not worried at all.
Except about you.

27:20.769 --> 27:22.510
Be nice to have
an Italian restaurant.

27:22.553 --> 27:23.903
Yeah. We still
own the building,

27:23.946 --> 27:25.556
but we can never
sell it or re-open it

27:25.600 --> 27:27.515
because of all these
new zoning laws.

27:27.558 --> 27:29.604
I don't even know where to
start with addressing that.

27:29.648 --> 27:32.694
Dude. I could totally help you.
I'm real estate lawyer.

27:32.738 --> 27:34.740
I eat local zoning
restrictions for lunch.

27:34.783 --> 27:36.350
Really

27:36.393 --> 27:38.961
I mean, how much do you cost,
though? You seem expensive.

27:39.005 --> 27:42.704
I am. But lucky for you, I've
recently become a nice person,

27:42.748 --> 27:45.185
so... I'm easy.
Just buy me a beer.

27:45.228 --> 27:47.317
Okay.

27:47.361 --> 27:50.581
Oh, okay. Okay, they're going
into business together.

27:50.625 --> 27:51.887
That's fine, that's fine.

27:51.931 --> 27:53.367
That's... fine.
Nothing bad can happen there.

27:53.410 --> 27:55.717
Okay, I'm gonna tell 'em.
I'm gonna walk right up to 'em.

27:55.761 --> 27:57.893
I'm gonna rip the Band-Aid off,
I'm gonna tell 'em the truth.

27:57.937 --> 27:59.678
We're all gonna
laugh about this.

27:59.721 --> 28:01.201
Gonna be hilarious, we're all...
we'll-we'll laugh.

28:01.244 --> 28:02.463
Good, I'm glad.

28:02.506 --> 28:04.247
Okay.

28:04.291 --> 28:06.554
Where are they?
Where did they go?

28:06.597 --> 28:08.251
Do you think they left together?

28:08.295 --> 28:10.079
REBECCA:
At least I have
the right medicine now.

28:10.123 --> 28:11.907
I think I scared away
Jason forever, though.

28:11.951 --> 28:13.822
Girl, you almost
scared me away forever.

28:13.866 --> 28:16.216
It's such a bummer.
Jason was so nice.

28:16.259 --> 28:17.391
I really liked him.

28:17.434 --> 28:18.958
Well, if you like
him, then text him.

28:19.001 --> 28:21.395
Tell him the truth.
He sent you

28:21.438 --> 28:22.962
a picture of himself pooping.

28:23.005 --> 28:25.094
What's going on with you
is not grosser than that.

28:25.138 --> 28:27.270
I mean, for me, it's all
gross and none of it

28:27.314 --> 28:29.272
should be talked about,
but for you guys,

28:29.316 --> 28:31.231
it might be fine?

28:31.274 --> 28:32.754
Do it, girl.
Tell him.

28:32.798 --> 28:34.190
So, Jason,
what happened was--

28:34.234 --> 28:36.453
and here's the truth--
I got a yeast infection

28:36.497 --> 28:37.628
and I kind of
overcorrected a bit

28:37.672 --> 28:39.282
and gave myself
bacterial vaginosis,

28:39.326 --> 28:40.719
but I'm on
the right medicine now,

28:40.762 --> 28:42.329
and I'll be better in a week

28:42.372 --> 28:44.418
and if you're still down
after reading this text message,

28:44.461 --> 28:46.115
I would like
to hang out very much.

28:46.159 --> 28:48.378
Respectfully yours,
Rebecca Nora Bunch.

28:48.422 --> 28:49.684
And send.

28:49.728 --> 28:52.078
Was that good?

28:52.121 --> 28:55.777
Well, I might have phrased
it a bit differently--

28:55.821 --> 28:57.779
again, we're very, very
different people--

28:57.823 --> 28:58.867
but...

28:58.911 --> 29:01.609
Oh, my God, it's Jason.

29:01.652 --> 29:02.915
W

29:02.958 --> 29:05.700
He said, "That's cool,
let's hang out tonight.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.789
"My mom's a gyno, NBD.

29:07.833 --> 29:09.312
"I'll bring over
a room spray,

29:09.356 --> 29:11.924
put on some thick sweats."

29:11.967 --> 29:14.753
Hmm.Also, son of a gyno?

29:14.796 --> 29:16.885
What a dream.

29:18.844 --> 29:20.454
BERT:
Paula, will you tell Darryl

29:20.497 --> 29:22.804
that the client
from Azusa wishes to file

29:22.848 --> 29:26.373
a soil-assessment request with
the wildlife management office?

29:26.416 --> 29:28.157
Nope, not gonna do that.

29:28.201 --> 29:30.029
Also, he just heard you.

29:30.072 --> 29:32.640
Jim, tell Bert
that any idiot knows

29:32.683 --> 29:34.860
that ecological soil testing
needs to be done on-site

29:34.903 --> 29:36.818
and he would know that
if he wasn't a weirdo

29:36.862 --> 29:38.733
who used to live in a sewer.

29:38.777 --> 29:41.170
Wait, start over. I only got
the first part of that.

29:41.214 --> 29:42.824
BERT:
You know what, I'm nice.

29:42.868 --> 29:44.043
I'm very nice.

29:44.086 --> 29:46.523
But I also have
very thin emotional skin.

29:46.567 --> 29:47.611
Like my finger skin.

29:47.655 --> 29:49.831
Which is now protected.

29:49.875 --> 29:52.312
Thank you so much, Bert.

29:52.355 --> 29:54.749
Because of Darryl,
I feel myself regressing

29:54.793 --> 29:56.707
into a more raw state.

29:56.751 --> 29:58.709
I've had to go
to group therapy

29:58.753 --> 30:00.624
every morning this week,
which has interfered

30:00.668 --> 30:02.757
with my morning
desert spelunking.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.628
You have cost me the love
and the cherishment

30:04.672 --> 30:05.847
of my loved ones.

30:05.891 --> 30:06.848
Cherishment--
not a word.

30:06.892 --> 30:08.807
My professional family!

30:08.850 --> 30:10.025
Oh...You've ruined
everything.

30:10.069 --> 30:11.810
And you stole
my upper lip style choice,

30:11.853 --> 30:12.811
you son of a...PAULA:
Oh!

30:12.854 --> 30:14.987
Aah! Get away from me!Aah!

30:15.030 --> 30:17.163
What is your problem?!Stop it! Stop it right now!

30:17.206 --> 30:18.686
Stop it! Stop it!

30:18.729 --> 30:21.210
That is enough!

30:21.254 --> 30:22.298
I wasn't doing anything.

30:22.342 --> 30:24.300
Get off.

30:26.302 --> 30:28.000
We can't go on like this.

30:28.043 --> 30:29.871
We need to call in
a professional.

30:39.315 --> 30:42.928
Father Brah, it's so cool
you do workplace mediations.

30:42.971 --> 30:44.668
Yeah, in this economic climate,
I can't afford

30:44.712 --> 30:46.845
to not diversify.Hmm.
Father,

30:46.888 --> 30:48.281
I have a confession.

30:48.324 --> 30:50.239
You're super cute.

30:50.283 --> 30:52.285
Oh, uh, uh, please don't.

30:52.328 --> 30:54.548
Okay, workplace
conflict arises

30:54.591 --> 30:57.290
when we bring
our emotional needs

30:57.333 --> 30:58.769
to a transactional environment.

30:58.813 --> 31:00.902
It's Darryl's fault.
I think he's borderline

31:00.946 --> 31:04.514
and has BPD or maybe
he has narcissism and has NPD.

31:04.558 --> 31:05.864
Or is in the NYPD.

31:05.907 --> 31:09.650
Or he's NPH.
I love when he hosts the Tonys.

31:09.693 --> 31:11.957
By the way, he was
so right this year.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.221
Who was that weird lady
backstage with the tiny top hat?

31:15.264 --> 31:18.137
Do not put this on me,
Bert Buttenweiser.

31:18.180 --> 31:20.791
Or shall I say Buttenweasel?

31:20.835 --> 31:22.010
You knew exactly

31:22.054 --> 31:23.838
what you were doing.GEORGE:
No, no.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.013
I cannot go through this again.

31:25.057 --> 31:26.928
Saturdays with Dad,
Sundays with Mom.

31:26.972 --> 31:29.409
Holidays...
with who knows who...

31:29.452 --> 31:30.889
Well, check
the calendar, Georgie.

31:30.932 --> 31:32.194
Where's my favorite windbreaker?

31:32.238 --> 31:33.848
You must have left it
at your mother's place.

31:33.892 --> 31:36.372
Well, then, why don't you ask
her new boyfriend

31:36.416 --> 31:39.506
to buy you a new one since
he's so much wealthier than me?

31:43.031 --> 31:44.424
BRAH:
Bert, Darryl,

31:44.467 --> 31:46.295
I think you can see the toll

31:46.339 --> 31:47.862
this is taking
on your employees.

31:47.906 --> 31:50.430
Can you put aside your
personal differences and your

31:50.473 --> 31:52.214
facial-hair resentments
for a moment?

31:55.522 --> 31:57.350
Is this stupidity over?

32:07.838 --> 32:10.102
He's right,
I've been terrible.

32:10.145 --> 32:12.452
We're hurting people.
People we care about.

32:12.495 --> 32:13.714
I'm sorry.

32:13.757 --> 32:15.803
You can be the Dad.

32:15.846 --> 32:19.067
You be Dad. I'll be Papa.Uh, again,

32:19.111 --> 32:21.200
I encourage you
to see this work environment

32:21.243 --> 32:22.941
through a professional lens,
if possible.

32:22.984 --> 32:25.117
Okay, then.
It's settled.

32:25.160 --> 32:26.988
Daddy, Papa.So, no?

32:27.032 --> 32:29.512
And I will relinquish
my glorious facial hair.

32:29.556 --> 32:32.124
I guess, on some level,
I grew the moustache

32:32.167 --> 32:33.560
because I wanted
to compete with you.

32:33.603 --> 32:37.303
You are so kind and beloved.

32:37.346 --> 32:39.131
Aw.

32:39.174 --> 32:40.784
BRAH:
I think we did it.

32:40.828 --> 32:42.917
Yeah, well done.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.833
Good job, everyone.

32:45.876 --> 32:49.576
Um, everything you said
was super smart,

32:49.619 --> 32:52.492
and I just wanted to ask
what are you doing later,

32:52.535 --> 32:56.017
and do you like oatmeal
draft lattes? 'Cause I do.

32:56.061 --> 32:57.453
I'm a priest.

32:57.497 --> 32:59.847
I'm a Capricorn.

32:59.890 --> 33:01.501
I think this could work.

33:01.544 --> 33:03.068
I never thought
I'd have a gym buddy,

33:03.111 --> 33:05.070
mostly because I never
thought I'd have a gym.Yeah,

33:05.113 --> 33:07.289
and I don't usually talk
to people who are sweating.

33:07.333 --> 33:09.074
Or just people in general.

33:09.117 --> 33:10.597
But I'm nice now, so...You know,

33:10.640 --> 33:12.555
you don't need to say it.
You could just be it,

33:12.599 --> 33:13.948
and people will think it.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.819
Hmm.Having said that,

33:15.863 --> 33:16.951
I am glad I met you.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.997
It's really hard
to make a new friend,

33:19.040 --> 33:22.391
and it's been great to take
my mind off my personal life.Oh, right, your ex.

33:22.435 --> 33:24.915
Yeah, it's so stupid I'm even
thinking about her at all

33:24.959 --> 33:25.960
after what she did.

33:26.004 --> 33:28.615
Pretty bad, huh?As bad as it gets.

33:28.658 --> 33:29.877
Oof.And what's worse

33:29.920 --> 33:31.661
is I want to forgive her.

33:31.705 --> 33:33.968
I-I just can't stop
thinking about her.

33:34.012 --> 33:37.058
I-I hear you, man. I'm in the
same boat with my ex. I mean,

33:37.102 --> 33:38.538
she clearly dumped me,

33:38.581 --> 33:40.540
and I can't stop
thinking about her either.

33:40.583 --> 33:44.500
I mean, God, women, they are...

33:44.544 --> 33:45.936
our equal in every way.

33:45.980 --> 33:47.721
Well, maybe you should just
tell her how you feel.

33:47.764 --> 33:49.244
I've done that. Like,
four times. It never works.

33:49.288 --> 33:51.246
Yeah, but you just told me
that you've changed.

33:51.290 --> 33:52.813
Does she know that?

33:52.856 --> 33:54.684
Kinda. I don't know.

33:54.728 --> 33:57.122
How about this.

33:57.165 --> 33:59.254
How about you tell your ex
that you've changed,

33:59.298 --> 34:01.778
and I'll tell mine I can't
stop thinking about her.

34:01.822 --> 34:03.693
When?Now. Yeah.

34:03.737 --> 34:06.000
And this isn't just
the lemonade talking.

34:06.044 --> 34:07.828
Really

34:07.871 --> 34:09.264
Yeah, come on.

34:09.308 --> 34:10.744
Use your legs, weakling!

34:10.787 --> 34:12.137
Ah, that's a little
too much, though.

34:12.180 --> 34:13.660
Yeah, sorry. It felt
weird coming out.

34:13.703 --> 34:15.966
No, you're right, we should.
Why don't you go first.

34:16.010 --> 34:18.056
I'll pay the tab because,
not only am I nice,

34:18.099 --> 34:20.101
I'm also rich.

34:20.145 --> 34:21.233
I'll work on that.

34:21.276 --> 34:22.973
I'll work on that.Yeah. Yeah.

34:23.017 --> 34:24.018
All right, good luck.

34:24.062 --> 34:25.106
You too.

34:25.150 --> 34:26.325
WHITE JOSH:
Oh, my God.

34:26.368 --> 34:27.674
My friend from the
wine bar just texted me.

34:27.717 --> 34:29.763
Greg and Nathaniel had a
drink together and they're

34:29.806 --> 34:32.635
both gonna see their exes.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

34:32.679 --> 34:35.073
I have to go.
I have to go do something.What?

34:35.116 --> 34:37.118
I don't know.What are you gonna do
when you get there?

34:37.162 --> 34:39.033
I don't know, okay?
I'm gonna think of something

34:39.077 --> 34:40.687
very eloquent to say
on my way over there

34:40.730 --> 34:42.558
and then I am
going to say it to them

34:42.602 --> 34:43.994
when I get there.
Okay.

34:44.038 --> 34:46.432
REBECCA:
I'm so glad you came over.

34:54.048 --> 34:57.356
Hey. I know
it's still a little

34:57.399 --> 35:00.489
problematic for me
down there, but...

35:00.533 --> 35:03.231
there's other stuff we can do.

35:03.275 --> 35:05.407
Oh. Okay.

35:05.451 --> 35:08.149
Are you sure?

35:08.193 --> 35:11.457
Yeah.

35:13.154 --> 35:17.463

35:41.791 --> 35:43.837
if it were just a
plot-free dance revue.

35:43.880 --> 35:45.186
JASON:
What?

35:45.230 --> 35:46.535
God, I'm nervous.

35:46.579 --> 35:49.059
Why am I nervous?
I didn't do anything wrong.

35:49.103 --> 35:50.844
I didn't sleep
with anyone's dad.

35:50.887 --> 35:53.151
I've never even
met Rebecca's dad.

35:53.194 --> 35:55.588
Greg?Hey...

35:55.631 --> 35:57.329
Oh, you came here
for moral support?

35:57.372 --> 35:59.157
Thanks, bud, but I got it.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.333
Wait, how'd you even
know where I was?

36:01.376 --> 36:04.466
Oh, God.

36:04.510 --> 36:06.686
You're thatGreg.

36:08.253 --> 36:09.819
Wait.

36:09.863 --> 36:12.126
You're thatjerk real estate
dude she dated?

36:12.170 --> 36:14.172
Yep. Yep, that's me.

36:14.215 --> 36:17.175
So that means that Rebecca
had sex with your...Yes.

36:17.218 --> 36:19.133
Him and me and...

36:19.177 --> 36:20.961
obviously, you.

36:22.745 --> 36:26.096
Ah. Uh-huh.

36:26.140 --> 36:28.098
Greg, Nathaniel.
Nathaniel, Greg.

36:28.142 --> 36:29.578
Oh, you did that
already, huh?

36:29.622 --> 36:32.277
Oh, man, I... I did not
do a good job with this, huh?

36:32.320 --> 36:33.582
So I'm gonna...

36:33.626 --> 36:36.281
I'll just see you guys
at the, uh...

36:36.324 --> 36:38.239
Nope, no.
Probably not.

36:38.283 --> 36:39.632
Okay.
I'll see you guys.

36:54.037 --> 36:57.432
What is that?

36:57.476 --> 37:00.392
Ugh, I think I have some of
those feral cats on my patio.

37:00.435 --> 37:02.132
I got to go get rid of them.

37:02.176 --> 37:03.395
Okay. Don't take too long.

37:03.438 --> 37:04.613
I won't.

37:04.657 --> 37:07.486
Keep yourself horny.
Stay in the mood.

37:10.532 --> 37:12.491
I can't believe this.Oh, I can.

37:12.534 --> 37:14.275
When I get around Rebecca,

37:14.319 --> 37:17.191
this is the kind of thing
that happens to me.

37:20.455 --> 37:22.065
What are you guys doing here?

37:22.109 --> 37:23.545
I wanted to talk to you.

37:23.589 --> 37:25.199
I also
wanted to talk to you.

37:25.243 --> 37:26.287
Okay. About what?

37:26.331 --> 37:28.246
JASON:
Is everything okay?

37:28.289 --> 37:30.813
Jason, it's-it's fine.
This is a... long story.

37:30.857 --> 37:33.207
JustJOSH:
Is it the feral cats?

37:33.251 --> 37:35.209
Don't get bitten!
I will protect you...

37:35.253 --> 37:37.211
Oh. Hey, dudes.
What's going on?

37:37.255 --> 37:38.386
Rebecca, who
are these guys?

37:38.430 --> 37:41.302
These are my ex-boyfriends.

37:41.346 --> 37:42.999
What is he doing here?We live together.

37:43.043 --> 37:45.480
Platonic...
platonically.

37:45.524 --> 37:47.352
Yeah.Those are not platonic panties.

37:47.395 --> 37:48.744
You know what?
I'm gonna head out.

37:48.788 --> 37:50.616
NATHANIEL:
Yeah, me, too.Also, me.

37:52.270 --> 37:54.533
God, women are... the future.

37:54.576 --> 37:57.275
Wait, guys. No, no, no. No,
no, Jason, Jason, don't go.

37:57.318 --> 37:59.277
I can explain.
Guys. Guys!

37:59.320 --> 38:01.409
What did you want to tell me?

38:05.457 --> 38:07.459
Sorry, Becks.

38:07.502 --> 38:09.809
I was trying to save you
from the cats.

VALENCIA:
Okay, so, wait--

38:47.760 --> 38:50.328
all of your exes showed
up on your doorstep?

38:50.371 --> 38:52.330
Are they still into you?

38:52.373 --> 38:55.028
I don't know.
I'm so confused.

38:55.071 --> 38:57.378
I mean, they all had something
to say and they saw each other,

38:57.422 --> 38:59.554
and no one said
what they wanted to say.

38:59.598 --> 39:01.817
Oh, God,
and I've tried to text Jason,

39:01.861 --> 39:03.428
like, "Jason,
I'm so sorry about tonight,"

39:03.471 --> 39:05.343
but he's not getting back to me,
so that's done.

39:05.386 --> 39:06.909
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

39:06.953 --> 39:08.215
After everything you've been
through this week

39:08.258 --> 39:10.522
with your... vagina.I know,

39:10.565 --> 39:12.393
and I didn't do anything wrong.No.

39:12.437 --> 39:13.568
I was just trying to get laid.

39:13.612 --> 39:15.657
Which now, apparently,
will never happen.

39:15.701 --> 39:17.442
God.

39:17.485 --> 39:20.358
Men.

39:20.401 --> 39:22.360
Can't live with 'em,
can't kill 'em.

39:22.403 --> 39:23.404
Yeah. We get to say that.

39:23.448 --> 39:24.710
We do.Yeah.

39:24.753 --> 39:26.581
Mmm.

39:28.540 --> 39:30.498
Wow. I really liked
that Jason guy.

39:30.542 --> 39:32.544
You kidding me?
Have you seen Josh?

39:32.587 --> 39:34.067
Meow.

39:34.110 --> 39:36.156
Josh? Honey, Nathaniel.

39:36.199 --> 39:37.375
That's where it's at.

39:37.418 --> 39:40.421
Mmm, I'm more
of a Greg girl myself.

39:40.465 --> 39:43.163
I still can't stop
thinking of Marco.

39:43.206 --> 39:45.426
He flipped me
like a pancake.

39:45.470 --> 39:46.558
Ooh!

39:46.601 --> 39:48.429
Meow.That's nasty.
