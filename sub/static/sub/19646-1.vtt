01:50.310 --> 01:51.643
Ah, fuck me.

01:54.614 --> 01:56.748
Ow! Fuck you! I said,
what did I say?

01:56.750 --> 01:56.748
You knocked them!

01:56.750 --> 02:00.219
Tell me what I said.
I'll slap you upside your head,

02:00.221 --> 02:01.320
I told you I'm talking,
didn't I?

02:01.322 --> 02:04.756
What did I say, huh?
Ow! Let go, Dan!

02:04.758 --> 02:05.824
Fuck.

02:07.128 --> 02:07.126
Hey!
Now, listen to me.

02:07.128 --> 02:11.196
Hey! Mind your fucking
business, all right.

02:11.198 --> 02:12.564
Don't make me
call the cops, huh?

02:12.566 --> 02:14.533
So, maybe I just
beat your ass too then, huh?

02:14.535 --> 02:16.635
Oh, he said, "let her go."

02:17.270 --> 02:18.704
Jerk off, what are you deaf?

02:18.706 --> 02:20.272
Let her go.
Fuck you, too.

02:20.274 --> 02:22.274
What?
Are you fucking kidding me?

02:24.344 --> 02:26.145
Son of a...
I don't need help.

02:26.147 --> 02:28.280
Fuck, I can take care of myself.
Damn right.

02:28.282 --> 02:31.183
You fucking weird, with your
fat face and whatever.

02:31.185 --> 02:33.152
Nice mouth.
Real nice mouth.

02:33.154 --> 02:35.220
Fuck you!
Fuck your mother!

02:35.222 --> 02:36.622
You believe that shit?

02:36.624 --> 02:38.590
Both need help.
Yeah.

02:38.592 --> 02:39.791
Have a good one.

02:39.793 --> 02:41.160
Thanks.

03:23.670 --> 03:25.671
Dominic?
Yeah.

03:25.673 --> 03:27.706
I'm sick.
What?

03:27.708 --> 03:28.974
I'm sick!
What?

03:28.976 --> 03:30.809
Leonard didn't come home
last night.

03:30.811 --> 03:30.809
You gotta go out and find him.

03:30.811 --> 03:35.280
Don't give me any grief today.
You're the one who let him out.

03:35.282 --> 03:37.649
He was whining and carrying-on.
He wanted to go out.

03:37.651 --> 03:40.919
So you let him?
In the middle of the night?

03:40.921 --> 03:42.554
Coyotes and all...

03:43.823 --> 03:46.959
I'd like to kick you
in the balls right now. May I?

03:46.961 --> 03:49.528
Oh wait, I have to
find them first.

03:49.530 --> 03:49.528
Ah, here we go.

03:49.530 --> 03:53.298
Can you stand up to a cat
for Christ sake?

03:53.300 --> 03:55.234
I got sal's dad wake today.

03:55.343 --> 03:56.302
I'm just saying.

03:56.303 --> 03:59.238
Why is everything
an argument with you?

04:00.273 --> 04:04.309
My mother is going
into surgery today, remember?

04:04.311 --> 04:06.545
And since when are you and sal
such good friends anymore?

04:06.547 --> 04:10.382
Just find
Leonard first, all right?

04:10.384 --> 04:13.785
And pick up some toilet paper.
I just finished the last roll.

04:15.856 --> 04:18.656
Hey, Leonard...

04:18.659 --> 04:20.959
All right, I'll call you and let
you know how my mother's doing.

04:20.961 --> 04:23.595
All right.
Oh, shit.

04:23.597 --> 04:27.366
When you pick up toilet paper stop by the
cleaners, I forgot my black sweater.

04:27.368 --> 04:30.402
Toilet paper, sweater, got it.
Please...

04:30.404 --> 04:32.537
Just find Leonard.
Find him.

04:34.340 --> 04:35.974
I'll find him.

04:35.976 --> 04:39.411
Leonard!

04:42.915 --> 04:44.449
Fucking cat.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.355
Ah, fuck you.

04:52.458 --> 04:53.659
Nothing?

04:54.894 --> 04:54.893
That cat's got it in for you.

04:54.895 --> 04:59.364
He's probably hiding somewhere
laughing his ass off.

04:59.366 --> 05:01.900
Ah, cats, Connie, people...

05:01.902 --> 05:04.670
I take one day off of work and this
is the shit I gotta deal with.

05:04.672 --> 05:07.339
I told you about the guy slapping the
shit out of his girlfriend this morning.

05:07.341 --> 05:10.642
And her, she's fucked up. You're
lucky he didn't have a gun.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.512
You know, see, that's really fucked up.
What's fucked up now?

05:13.514 --> 05:15.914
That fact that the silver lining
is he didn't have a gun.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.983
I mean,
this entire city is insane.

05:17.985 --> 05:21.586
So move. Yeah, move. Where am I gonna move?
This is my home.

05:21.588 --> 05:23.622
I don't know.
Some place nice.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.024
What's nice?

05:26.026 --> 05:27.993
That phony,
"have a nice day" bullshit.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.795
I mean,
why can't people just be normal?

05:29.797 --> 05:33.065
I just want to get through
my life unscathed, that's it.

05:33.067 --> 05:35.000
Leave me alone.
Well, good luck with that.

05:35.002 --> 05:35.000
Yeah.

05:35.002 --> 05:38.503
So, we're gonna go
look for this cat or what?

05:38.505 --> 05:40.439
Yeah, I got to look for this
cat, I don't find this cat,

05:40.441 --> 05:42.341
I'm moving in with you,
so how's that?

05:44.778 --> 05:45.877
Who the hell is this?

05:50.883 --> 05:52.818
Hi.
Hi, dom.

05:55.054 --> 05:57.456
Hi! Betty.
I live across the street.

05:58.091 --> 05:59.658
He didn't come home yet?

05:59.660 --> 06:01.626
No, not yet.

06:01.628 --> 06:03.929
Connie called me
early this morning, frantic.

06:04.932 --> 06:08.900
<i>Si.</i> You remember when
my Bruno went missing?

06:12.873 --> 06:15.974
But I did these flyers...
Look.

06:15.976 --> 06:19.578
And I got so many calls.
Lots!

06:19.580 --> 06:22.481
I think it's brilliant, you know.
I can do one for you.

06:22.690 --> 06:23.649
Maybe it'd help.

06:23.650 --> 06:26.118
It's helping already, I think.

06:26.120 --> 06:28.120
Thanks, bet,
I really appreciate it.

06:28.122 --> 06:30.822
I'm gonna see how
I make out myself first, okay.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.591
Take the flyer, man.

06:32.593 --> 06:35.494
Is this your number?
Yeah.

06:37.130 --> 06:39.598
You see, you better find him.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.867
You got it. I'll let you
know how it make out.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.735
Bye.
Bye-bye.

06:43.737 --> 06:43.735
Bye.

06:43.737 --> 06:48.807
You know, Tommy the suit
bought a big ass SUV.

06:48.809 --> 06:48.807
Yeah.

06:48.809 --> 06:52.878
And I told him, you know, "gas
don't grow on trees," you know.

06:55.448 --> 06:56.782
That's true.

07:02.488 --> 07:04.623
She's worried about coyotes?

07:04.625 --> 07:07.092
What about the q-58 express bus?

07:07.094 --> 07:09.494
Leonard!

07:09.496 --> 07:09.494
Leonard!

07:09.496 --> 07:14.866
No doubt, liberace was gay way
before his time. Way before.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.002
Oh.

07:25.912 --> 07:27.612
Well, this was fun.

07:28.981 --> 07:31.483
Time to expand the search.

07:31.485 --> 07:32.851
We'll pack a suitcase?

07:42.728 --> 07:44.663
Hey!

07:44.665 --> 07:46.631
Are you for real?
I thought you were so sick.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.900
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
I joined the mathletes.

07:48.902 --> 07:51.937
I got a tournament.
Oh, you're hilarious.

07:52.113 --> 07:53.072
Stop your lying.

07:53.073 --> 07:58.910
Rolling in at 01:00 A.M. you can't
just come and go as you please.

07:58.912 --> 08:02.047
Hey, you know what?
I'm done with you.

08:02.049 --> 08:03.682
Let your father
deal with this shit.

08:03.684 --> 08:05.984
He's not my father.
Come on.

08:07.220 --> 08:10.088
You better be back here
before he gets home!

08:10.090 --> 08:12.557
Don't say I didn't warn you!

08:15.228 --> 08:16.928
So what's the game plan?

08:16.930 --> 08:17.996
You'll see.

08:23.669 --> 08:26.137
Where did you get this map?
From the year of the flood?

08:26.139 --> 08:28.039
You asked for
a from map of corona.

08:29.041 --> 08:29.040
It's a historical map.
What?

08:29.042 --> 08:32.977
What is this? A historical jacket?
It's a wake, remember?

08:32.980 --> 08:35.113
Now what do we need this for?
I know where the hell I am.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.549
One word... Connie.

08:37.551 --> 08:39.049
You mark where you look.

08:39.052 --> 08:42.787
If you don't find him,
you have proof that you looked.

08:42.789 --> 08:45.257
Is it okay? Yes fine, I
have like fifty of them.

08:45.259 --> 08:46.892
What is it with you and maps?

08:46.894 --> 08:46.892
You know, ponce...

08:46.894 --> 08:51.796
Can I just like, not to looking,
and still mark up the map.

08:51.798 --> 08:54.699
Let's do that then. Yeah, right.
That's good for you.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.768
Back to my plan then?
Yeah, go ahead.

08:56.770 --> 09:00.105
So, we're pretty much bordered
by hazardous roads.

09:00.107 --> 09:02.807
So, we start here
in Roosevelt...

09:03.242 --> 09:04.943
Down to 1/11...

09:05.912 --> 09:07.612
Long island expressway...

09:07.980 --> 09:10.782
Here, here, mm?

09:10.784 --> 09:12.284
I could have
found the cat by now.

09:12.286 --> 09:12.284
It's been eight years, huh?
Yep.

09:12.286 --> 09:19.057
You looked like a maniac sitting in with the
vet with a python wrapped around your neck.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.293
Connie freaked.
You see that?

09:21.295 --> 09:23.161
You guys have
just rescued Leonard.

09:23.163 --> 09:26.698
You and I meet. And here I
am, helping you to find him.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.601
- It was all meant to be.
- Yeah, meant to be.

09:30.770 --> 09:34.005
What was the name of the snake again?
Snake.

09:34.007 --> 09:37.175
Listen, I appreciate the
company, bud. I do.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.578
No problem.
I got time.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.913
Besides, what if somebody
tries to take your lunch money?

09:41.915 --> 09:43.915
It's Connie's bike.
Mine's busted, all right.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.751
You looked in a mirror lately?
All right, where to?

09:46.753 --> 09:48.987
You're the one with the map.

09:49.355 --> 09:50.822
Let's go.

10:52.385 --> 10:56.054
No cat. But he says, I'm a dead
ringer of his deceased cousin.

10:56.056 --> 10:56.054
Before dead or after?

10:56.056 --> 11:00.225
I don't know. Let's go check the
lot around the corner, huh?

11:07.133 --> 11:11.236
Yo! Yo, Leonard!
Where you been?

11:11.238 --> 11:15.407
Don't look at me for inspiration, I'd
bag this whole thing for a cold beer.

11:15.409 --> 11:17.842
I come from a long line
of non-motivators.

11:18.045 --> 11:18.944
You?

11:18.945 --> 11:18.943
Your father
was the heavyweight champ.

11:18.945 --> 11:25.283
"Stop being so low in your life. You gonna
keep this in the god damn urinal completely!"

11:25.285 --> 11:28.019
He used to say to me. I can't
tell you how many times.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.223
I wondered why your shoes
always looked wet.

11:52.244 --> 11:53.712
Leonard!

11:57.249 --> 11:58.850
Fucking cat.

12:04.323 --> 12:05.757
What?

12:05.925 --> 12:07.158
What!

12:10.730 --> 12:12.330
Check this shit out.
Hey, good eyes.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.867
What the fuck is that!
What?

12:19.004 --> 12:20.739
Oh, shit!

12:20.741 --> 12:20.739
It's a fucking ear!

12:20.741 --> 12:25.410
This ain't a gag, is it? No, that's
someone's sliced of a fucking ear!

12:25.412 --> 12:27.345
Van gogh live around here?

12:27.347 --> 12:30.749
Should we call the cops? No, I'm not
getting involved with that shit.

12:32.418 --> 12:32.417
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

12:32.419 --> 12:36.354
Don't throw that in there. We've got
our fingerprints all over the bag now.

12:36.356 --> 12:38.089
You said you didn't want
to get involved.

12:38.092 --> 12:38.991
I did.

12:38.992 --> 12:42.894
Just give it to me.
I'll, I'll give it to sal.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.963
We'll take care of it.
Yeah.

12:44.965 --> 12:47.232
Hey, you want to split this?

12:48.134 --> 12:50.301
What?
Money.

12:51.904 --> 12:53.171
No.

12:56.809 --> 13:00.111
I was born way too late.

13:00.113 --> 13:04.215
Give me the old west,
with saloon towns, and

13:04.217 --> 13:07.085
horse turds steaming
in the streets, and

13:08.187 --> 13:10.855
shootouts at sundown,

13:11.991 --> 13:13.992
I live every day
to die, partner.

13:13.994 --> 13:18.830
So today, it's me or you?

13:29.041 --> 13:30.942
Yeah, tweasel said
to look out for you.

13:30.944 --> 13:33.278
Yeah, tweasel is a fucktard.

13:34.313 --> 13:36.447
And, let's be clear on, man.

13:36.449 --> 13:36.447
I'm hearing.

13:36.449 --> 13:41.119
Tweasel organizes
a whole little party.

13:41.987 --> 13:45.256
We just here to facilitate.

13:45.258 --> 13:48.860
You get my brother's truck
back here.

13:48.862 --> 13:52.230
And we'll take it from there,
clean, no wrinkles.

13:52.232 --> 13:55.934
You have my word. And what word
are we talking about here?

13:55.936 --> 14:00.305
Is the word chair?
Or is it recalcitrant?

14:00.307 --> 14:02.073
I would like that word.

14:04.043 --> 14:06.444
It...
It's my promise.

14:07.479 --> 14:11.282
I got you again!
You gotta relax, Bambi!

14:18.524 --> 14:20.925
Don't push it over 60.
It'll stall.

14:20.927 --> 14:23.862
It has a tendency to stall.

14:26.165 --> 14:29.601
Maybe I'll step into the spray booth
a little. Catch a little buzz.

14:29.603 --> 14:31.970
That shit'll turn
your brain to glue, come on.

14:31.972 --> 14:34.939
Nah, that smells good!

14:36.275 --> 14:38.443
Right, amen?
Amir.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.079
You know how to drive a stick?

14:41.081 --> 14:43.915
Ah, been a while.
That's all right.

14:43.917 --> 14:45.350
It's automatic.

14:47.086 --> 14:51.256
Don't you ever fucking point your
finger at me! I will cut it off!

14:53.459 --> 14:54.926
There she is.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.361
Unless you planning on
running on fumes?

14:56.363 --> 14:57.929
Hit the fucking pump.

15:05.337 --> 15:06.437
Where'd you find him?

15:06.439 --> 15:09.240
Hey. Not yet.
<i>You find him?</i>

15:09.242 --> 15:11.676
Did you shake
the dry food bag outside?

15:11.678 --> 15:13.544
I shook the bag.
I'm out looking for him now.

15:13.546 --> 15:13.544
Hey, tell her
you just found an ear.

15:13.546 --> 15:17.582
Can you believe we're still waiting
for my mother to go into surgery?

15:17.584 --> 15:19.183
I want to hang myself.

15:19.451 --> 15:19.450
Wait a second.

15:19.452 --> 15:24.022
What's going on? I'm waiting to
find if Connie hung herself.

15:24.990 --> 15:26.557
<i>How is it for her?</i>

15:26.559 --> 15:28.159
This is so ridiculous.

15:28.161 --> 15:29.694
They actually had to
get here early, for what?

15:29.696 --> 15:31.095
My mother hasn't had
a thing to eat.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.331
Since midnight.
Mom, please.

15:33.999 --> 15:35.233
<i>Did you check the Gregory's?</i>

15:35.235 --> 15:38.169
Think I'm gonna pass out.
Stop.

15:38.171 --> 15:41.039
All right, listen. Let me call you
once she gets in to surgery all right?

15:41.041 --> 15:43.608
Hey, make sure you call me all right.
Don't forget.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.243
Call me, okay.
Bye.

15:45.245 --> 15:46.711
Yeah. Bye.

15:46.713 --> 15:48.980
Everything copacetic?
Yeah.

15:48.982 --> 15:51.449
What kind of a surgery is
Connie's mom having? Hernia.

15:51.451 --> 15:51.449
Ooh, a guy worked out a hernia.

15:51.451 --> 15:56.487
His intestines went right into his
right nut. Blew up like a soft ball.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.690
I'm pretty sure that's not
gonna happen to Connie's mom.

15:58.692 --> 16:01.059
It's definitely
a man's ear for sure.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.327
I wonder whose is it?

16:02.329 --> 16:05.630
I say,
we looking for a guy, 6'2",

16:05.632 --> 16:07.732
brown hair, walks with a limp,

16:07.734 --> 16:07.732
or a guy with his left
ear cut off, who knows.

16:07.734 --> 16:12.070
I don't wanna know. But I'm riding
around with a guy's ear in a bag.

16:12.072 --> 16:12.070
So I don't wanna talk about it.

16:12.072 --> 16:16.240
I still can't believe you put that
fucking money in your pocket.

16:17.009 --> 16:17.008
Why!
Why?

16:17.010 --> 16:21.446
Because of the fact it was in
a bag with a decomposing ear.

16:21.448 --> 16:23.114
Means nothing to you, huh?

16:28.487 --> 16:31.723
Whipped your sorry ass. You jumped
before go. It doesn't count.

16:31.725 --> 16:33.524
Oh, it counts.
Come on.

16:34.426 --> 16:35.706
You really are a dick sometimes.

16:40.632 --> 16:43.634
See, I told you already.
Cecil went away with her folks.

16:43.636 --> 16:45.470
Dealing with some family shit.

16:47.006 --> 16:50.241
Like you said.
They're not home.

16:50.243 --> 16:52.343
You're not thinking
of breaking in, are you?

16:59.686 --> 17:01.152
Hello.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.187
What are you two
doing back here?

17:03.189 --> 17:05.256
Is Cecil home?
We go to school with her.

17:05.258 --> 17:07.625
I don't like you sneaking around
looking in windows.

17:07.627 --> 17:08.792
Oh, we sneaking?

17:08.795 --> 17:08.792
She's not here.

17:08.795 --> 17:12.763
So, why don't you call or text
her, or whatever it is you do?

17:12.766 --> 17:15.066
Thanks.
We'll see Cecil at school.

17:16.535 --> 17:19.436
Fuck her.
Wherever she is.

17:23.041 --> 17:26.210
All right, what are you looking at now?
We are right on schedule, man.

17:26.212 --> 17:30.181
We covered that, and that...
Louis and park.

17:30.183 --> 17:32.503
Why don't we just look on the
other side of coroner Avenue?

17:34.119 --> 17:36.754
Well, we haven't covered
the entire quadrant yet.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.489
I was...

17:45.130 --> 17:47.231
Etiquette!
Etiquette said so.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.400
What do you know of etiquette? Where
do you come up with this shit?

17:49.402 --> 17:51.803
I'm talking about
modern day etiquette.

17:51.805 --> 17:54.272
Fellatio.
You could check on this.

17:54.274 --> 17:58.543
Fellatio, is the sincerest
form of flattery.

17:58.545 --> 18:01.212
"Don't flatter yourself,"
just got a whole new meaning.

18:01.214 --> 18:04.082
Oh, wait a second.
Maybe it's all sex.

18:04.084 --> 18:04.082
'Cause that's both
man and woman.

18:04.084 --> 18:09.120
Now you are one messed up individual.
Don't you have to be some place?

18:09.122 --> 18:11.222
Oh, come on.
You know you'd miss me.

18:11.790 --> 18:13.257
I would.

18:13.692 --> 18:14.826
For all the wrong reason.

18:14.828 --> 18:17.095
For all the right reason.

18:36.715 --> 18:38.616
Hey, what's up?
What are you doing?

18:39.351 --> 18:39.350
Ricky!

18:39.352 --> 18:42.653
- Hey, ponce!
- Son of a bitch, man!

18:42.655 --> 18:44.789
How are you, man? What's up, man?
Yo, you with this guy?

18:44.791 --> 18:46.491
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You live here?

18:46.493 --> 18:49.193
No, this is my lady's friend place.
What do you think?

18:49.195 --> 18:50.528
Yo, what's up?
What are you doing around here?

18:50.530 --> 18:53.598
We're looking for his cat.
Dom, Ricky. Ricky, dom.

18:54.166 --> 18:54.165
A cat?
Yeah.

18:54.167 --> 18:58.669
Man, personally, listen to me. I don't
dig cats. I'm more of a dog guy.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.705
They're loyal.
They won't run off on you.

19:00.707 --> 19:03.341
Some people with cats, they are like
real assholes, you know what I mean.

19:03.343 --> 19:03.341
No offense,
know what I'm saying.

19:03.343 --> 19:07.812
But hey, I almost ran over a cat
coming over here now, though.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.247
By 104, near the church.

19:09.249 --> 19:10.882
Yeah.

19:10.884 --> 19:13.284
Yeah, I almost got three points.

19:13.286 --> 19:16.854
Listen, our first solid
lead in the case.

19:16.856 --> 19:19.490
Bye, I love you. Good seeing you, man.
Say hi to the family.

19:19.492 --> 19:20.658
Take care.

19:23.530 --> 19:25.329
Asshole.
You know, I may be an asshole,

19:25.331 --> 19:27.498
but your friend was an asshole,
for calling me an asshole.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.567
Well, let's go back
and beat him to a pulp.

19:30.802 --> 19:30.801
Hey, you may wanna
double up on that.

19:30.803 --> 19:36.941
What, you don't believe in them, god,
heaven, death, evil, all that stuff?

19:36.943 --> 19:38.476
Nah.
I think about it.

19:38.478 --> 19:40.344
Whether I'm heading up or down.

19:40.346 --> 19:42.346
What's gonna be said
on my headstone.

19:42.348 --> 19:45.216
I know what mine's gonna say.
I should have been cremated.

19:45.218 --> 19:46.651
Well, you can never make
up your mind on this shit.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.686
He's not here.
Let's get the hell out.

19:51.323 --> 19:52.723
Father.

19:54.293 --> 19:58.229
Father, for the rectory.
No, no, please, please.

20:04.937 --> 20:06.938
What time is it?

20:06.940 --> 20:09.307
I'm starving.
Again with this.

20:09.309 --> 20:09.307
Wonder if Dominic
checked the playground.

20:09.309 --> 20:14.378
Enough with the cat. You're more
worried of him, than you're of me.

20:14.380 --> 20:16.480
Oh, stop being so melodramatic.

20:16.482 --> 20:20.651
I bet somebody died in the or.
That's why we're still waiting.

20:20.653 --> 20:22.420
It's probably that
old hunch back lady

20:22.422 --> 20:25.323
with that frizzy gray hair
that was sitting over there.

20:25.958 --> 20:28.492
She looked horrible.

20:28.494 --> 20:31.696
Hey, I'm sitting over here now.

20:33.832 --> 20:38.569
If they don't call you soon, I'm
gonna perform the surgery myself.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.705
Would you two stop now?

20:40.707 --> 20:43.975
Could I like, maybe have a
piece of hard candy? No.

20:43.977 --> 20:43.975
It will kill you, ma.

20:43.977 --> 20:47.411
Whoever heard of somebody
dying from a piece of candy?

20:47.413 --> 20:49.747
People choke on candy
all the time.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.249
Look at me.

20:52.718 --> 20:54.485
You need an empty stomach.

20:54.487 --> 20:58.022
How much room
can a piece of candy take?

20:58.024 --> 21:00.791
Oh my god,
we're gonna be here all day.

21:03.463 --> 21:06.797
If Dominic doesn't find Leonard,
I'm gonna kill him.

21:06.799 --> 21:07.898
I swear.

21:07.900 --> 21:10.735
Stop being so melodramatic.

21:15.716 --> 21:16.975
- Sal...
- Johnny...

21:16.976 --> 21:22.513
Sal, what you're asking me
is totally out of the question.

21:22.515 --> 21:24.915
Just tell me truthfully. How
much you making on the casket?

21:24.917 --> 21:28.552
It's just not done. There are health laws.
Come on, sal!

21:28.554 --> 21:30.454
Health laws? They're dead.
What are you worried about?

21:30.456 --> 21:31.622
I'm gonna catch the flu?

21:31.624 --> 21:34.659
Look, all I'm saying is,
we flip it.

21:34.661 --> 21:39.563
It's against the law.
I can't. I won't.

21:39.565 --> 21:41.565
You're telling me
you don't resell stuff.

21:41.567 --> 21:43.634
How many funerals
those flowers been to out there?

21:43.636 --> 21:46.604
Johnny, my father's being
cremated for Christ sake.

21:46.606 --> 21:48.739
We're recycling,
look at it that way.

21:48.741 --> 21:50.675
Good for the planet, no?

21:50.677 --> 21:51.909
Come on.

21:51.911 --> 21:53.444
How much you making on the box?

21:53.446 --> 21:55.680
Eight hundred, a grand.

21:55.682 --> 21:57.648
It's none of your business,
how much I'm making on the box.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.984
How about that, sal?
Johnny, come on.

21:59.986 --> 22:03.487
Come on, Sally... Oh, Johnny,
you're breaking my heart.

22:03.489 --> 22:05.756
You're breaking my heart, sal...

22:05.758 --> 22:07.558
Johnny...
Sally...

22:08.060 --> 22:09.660
You filthy son...

22:12.564 --> 22:14.899
This is truly
getting stupid now.

22:16.969 --> 22:18.736
No, I haven't found him yet.

22:20.038 --> 22:21.806
You know,
maybe we should just split up.

22:21.808 --> 22:23.808
Or let's say, give up, huh?

22:23.810 --> 22:26.410
You got me for a little while
longer, let's look, okay.

22:26.412 --> 22:26.410
I'll do the blocks
down that way.

22:26.412 --> 22:31.615
And I'll meet you at the corner
of 111th and 42nd. All right.

23:43.021 --> 23:44.655
He ate the fucking ear.

23:46.091 --> 23:47.825
Who ate the ear?
The dog.

23:48.560 --> 23:49.860
Why'd you give the dog the ear?

23:49.862 --> 23:51.762
He was chasing my ass.
I had to do something.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.764
You know, I leave you for a
minute, and look what happens.

23:53.766 --> 23:56.167
Ponce, it was
a huge fucking dog, all right.

23:56.169 --> 23:57.935
Least, we still have
the bloody money, right?

23:59.905 --> 24:02.740
I gave the money to the priest.

24:02.742 --> 24:05.443
Look, you know, keep the
money, don't keep the money,

24:05.445 --> 24:09.079
more importantly, I think
I might have, might

24:09.081 --> 24:11.115
have seen something,
by the tavern.

24:11.117 --> 24:15.686
Well, it could have been a cat, could have
been a rat, could have been a black bag

24:15.688 --> 24:19.123
just blowing by... I, I gotta
get my eyes checked. So, and...

24:19.125 --> 24:21.058
I wanted to
finish my ice-cream first.

24:22.194 --> 24:23.727
You gonna get me one?

24:26.198 --> 24:27.998
But, but, this one is yours.

24:32.471 --> 24:35.473
Rats bunking
in this freaking rack!

24:36.174 --> 24:38.876
Fuck, got me cleaning!

24:40.078 --> 24:43.681
I cannot have it, to clean up...

24:43.683 --> 24:46.050
Teach me about
a fucking job to do...

24:47.052 --> 24:48.085
Shit!

24:48.087 --> 24:50.087
Fucking clear it out.

24:50.856 --> 24:52.022
Thorny motherfucker.

24:54.861 --> 24:58.829
<i>Street is cold, asphalt don't get
back, it only takes it's hands,</i>

24:58.831 --> 25:01.131
<i>worn by the scraps
it pulls from the ground</i>

25:01.133 --> 25:02.967
<i>he's not afraid of nothing,
why would he be?</i>

25:02.969 --> 25:05.870
<i>Street will named for him
when the time has come</i>

25:05.872 --> 25:07.738
<i>when his time has passed</i>

25:07.740 --> 25:11.876
<i>up and green or white, reflecting in
the night, above the cold, asphalt</i>

25:11.878 --> 25:14.545
<i>that only takes...</i>

25:14.547 --> 25:16.647
Like I've said before,
it's got no swag.

25:16.649 --> 25:18.849
What do you know?
What you ever pen?

25:18.851 --> 25:20.117
I penned this.

25:21.820 --> 25:23.053
Not worth, boy.

25:34.288 --> 25:35.967
So, your cat's missing, huh?

25:35.968 --> 25:41.539
We got two at home. My wife would die
if anything were to happen to them.

25:42.240 --> 25:45.242
Hey, Dominic, look at this.

25:45.244 --> 25:47.611
Dry as a whistle, baby.
I don't get any.

25:49.781 --> 25:53.250
Hey, don't beat yourself up.

25:53.252 --> 25:55.686
We searched this block,
inside out.

25:55.688 --> 25:57.655
Fellow travelers...

25:57.657 --> 25:59.557
Hey, what's the good word, Phil?

25:59.559 --> 26:01.158
You're born, you jerk off.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.027
You get married, you jerk off.

26:03.029 --> 26:04.762
You have kids, you jerk off.

26:04.764 --> 26:09.133
Maybe grandkids, you still
jerk off, and then you die.

26:11.202 --> 26:12.703
You two related?

26:14.039 --> 26:15.172
Hey.

26:16.308 --> 26:17.841
Shooting pool.

26:18.910 --> 26:21.645
That scumbag,
he's not from around here.

26:21.647 --> 26:24.281
Get this.
Says his name is sue.

26:24.283 --> 26:26.183
For real?
I kid you not.

26:26.185 --> 26:29.219
His brother, half brother, I
don't know, some shit like that,

26:29.221 --> 26:30.287
Guillermo.

26:30.289 --> 26:31.789
You probably seen him here.

26:31.791 --> 26:34.792
From what I now,
this sue guy, is a lifer.

26:34.794 --> 26:37.194
He in and out of prison.
Well, he looks fucked up.

26:37.196 --> 26:39.763
Looks? Certifiable.

26:39.765 --> 26:43.834
I hear he's waiting trial here in
New York, on a big fat drug bust.

26:43.836 --> 26:46.704
But the case was just thrown out.
So who fucking knows.

26:49.240 --> 26:52.610
What makes somebody think it's
okay to let their dog lick my leg?

26:52.612 --> 26:54.778
Good thing it wasn't a big dog.

26:54.780 --> 26:57.781
Maybe I wouldn't have minded then.
I charge 15 for that.

26:57.783 --> 27:00.651
Unrestrained flattery, Maria.

27:02.220 --> 27:03.954
Flattery, see what I tell you.

27:05.223 --> 27:05.222
So, you gonna keep on looking?

27:05.224 --> 27:10.894
I don't know. I still gotta pay my
respects to the funeral parlor.

27:10.896 --> 27:12.896
You know,
I never liked your pal, sal.

27:12.898 --> 27:15.399
He gave me a ticket once.
Come on, he's all right.

27:15.401 --> 27:17.968
Fuck you!
How long we know each other?

27:17.970 --> 27:21.038
With all due respect,
you're a little outta control.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.107
Sal, look, don't put me
in this position.

27:23.109 --> 27:25.376
This is not a big deal.

27:25.378 --> 27:29.847
Look, I'm in a bind there. Look,
I'm still gonna have to say no.

27:29.849 --> 27:32.249
I told you when you got started
with this kind of thing lately.

27:32.251 --> 27:36.020
I helped you once, but that's it.
You got a problem, sal.

27:36.022 --> 27:38.722
Look, I'm sorry. I know this
is a tough time for you.

27:38.724 --> 27:40.824
Yeah, and you ain't
making it any better.

27:40.826 --> 27:43.394
Come on, don't be that way.
You're making me feel bad.

27:43.396 --> 27:45.229
Good, then you'll help.

27:56.207 --> 27:58.375
Are you talking
to anybody, Jimmy?

27:58.377 --> 28:01.712
Yeah, you.
No, seriously, pipes, come on.

28:01.714 --> 28:03.814
Losing Peggy, than this shit.

28:03.816 --> 28:06.016
I haven't any time.
I will.

28:08.887 --> 28:13.157
You know, sometimes things get so fucked up
you wish you could hit reset and start over.

28:15.427 --> 28:18.028
Then again, I'm better off
to most vets I know.

28:18.030 --> 28:21.799
And, we still got our looks.
Well, I do.

28:22.767 --> 28:25.836
Anything you need.
I'm fine.

28:25.838 --> 28:29.039
I just need some time
with myself, that's all.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.241
But, I will be fine.

28:32.277 --> 28:33.777
Thanks, ponce.

28:41.288 --> 28:42.187
Hey, hey.

28:42.188 --> 28:46.023
Where you've been? <i>I've been trying
to reach you. Any sign of Leonard?</i>

28:46.025 --> 28:49.093
Did I call?
<i>No, she's finally in surgery.</i>

28:49.095 --> 28:51.395
I guess, we'll see her in a couple
of hours when she's in recovery.

28:51.397 --> 28:53.230
All right, that's good.

28:53.232 --> 28:56.767
Hey, ballsack, find someplace
else to talk to your boyfriend.

28:57.068 --> 28:58.235
Where are you?

28:58.237 --> 29:00.304
At the drycleaners.

29:00.306 --> 29:04.074
Dominic, you better find Leonard.
I'm not kidding.

29:04.809 --> 29:06.944
I heard you the first six times.

29:06.946 --> 29:10.280
Come on, you're in my fucking eye line.
I was on the phone!

29:11.983 --> 29:15.185
Maybe I need to articulate
my position more clearly.

29:15.187 --> 29:18.922
Shut the fuck up, and go back
where you came from, all right?

29:20.859 --> 29:24.161
Ah, come on.
How about a game of eight-ball?

29:24.163 --> 29:27.865
Or I could just jam this
through your fucking skull, huh?

29:29.834 --> 29:30.901
Huh?

29:31.836 --> 29:36.073
Dom, everything okay back here?

29:37.208 --> 29:38.308
You okay?

29:40.011 --> 29:41.211
Yeah.

30:08.506 --> 30:11.909
Mm, I was just talking
to Jimmy pipes...

30:11.911 --> 30:14.178
Someone broke into
his place yesterday.

30:14.180 --> 30:17.881
Probably some kids. They drank all
his booze, took some small crap.

30:18.383 --> 30:20.818
But he seemed really down.

30:20.820 --> 30:23.086
They took his purple heart.
You believe that shit.

30:24.124 --> 30:25.023
People suck.

30:25.024 --> 30:29.226
I have no idea what it takes to
turn into someone like that.

30:31.529 --> 30:33.263
You okay?

30:33.265 --> 30:35.532
I don't think this fucking day
can get any worse.

30:35.534 --> 30:36.967
It's still early.

31:01.059 --> 31:03.460
Dominic, it's been real, man.
Yeah?

31:04.929 --> 31:06.997
I hope you find
your little friend.

31:06.999 --> 31:10.334
Thanks for helping me
out today, all right?

31:10.336 --> 31:14.471
Maybe it's time to take Betty up
on the flyer offer, you know.

31:14.473 --> 31:16.340
You sure?
I'll take care on that.

31:16.342 --> 31:16.340
All right.
All right?

31:16.342 --> 31:20.310
I'll swing by your house later to see what's
what, okay? All right, be safe, okay.

31:20.945 --> 31:22.279
Oh, I almost forgot.

31:23.248 --> 31:25.883
Here, keep it for Connie.

31:25.885 --> 31:27.885
Somebody colored
all over that shit.

31:27.887 --> 31:30.354
All right, peace.
Take care, buddy. Take it easy.

32:02.186 --> 32:03.453
Fuckface, ex-con.

32:18.069 --> 32:20.671
What's wrong?
I had a good day.

32:20.673 --> 32:22.139
You look stunning.

32:22.141 --> 32:23.273
Thank you.

32:26.045 --> 32:29.947
Oh, fuck her, I did.

32:32.417 --> 32:34.117
Yo, you deaf, shitstain?

32:34.119 --> 32:36.486
Ignore them, they're idiots.

32:40.959 --> 32:45.595
Dominic, I just want to
let you know.

32:45.597 --> 32:48.999
I didn't fuck any of them.
I swear.

32:49.734 --> 32:52.102
How the fuck does that
make me feel any better?

32:55.740 --> 32:58.108
Well, at least,
you're being honest.

33:03.214 --> 33:04.414
Fuck!

33:05.717 --> 33:07.150
What was that?

33:30.708 --> 33:35.045
Don't worry, Shelly knows how to handle
that situation better than anybody.

33:36.347 --> 33:39.449
Yeah, but he don't
know about that.

33:39.451 --> 33:41.551
Hey, you got a license
for this thing here?

33:41.553 --> 33:43.787
Oh, I'll call you later.

33:43.789 --> 33:46.423
Look, who it is!
How you doing, uncle Sam?

33:47.325 --> 33:50.327
Look at you.
Listen, your aunt ain't here.

33:50.329 --> 33:52.496
She went down to visit
your mother in Florida.

33:52.498 --> 33:56.299
She gonna be so sorry she missed you.
Ah, me too. I came to see you.

33:56.301 --> 33:58.368
You came to see me?
All dressed up like this.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.470
You don't have to dress up
to see me.

34:00.472 --> 34:00.470
All right.
Stay sharp.

34:00.472 --> 34:05.108
Had to go to a wake. You know my
old friend sal? His father passed.

34:05.110 --> 34:08.245
Ah, good, that son of a bitch.
I never liked that guy.

34:08.246 --> 34:10.614
How's Connie?
She's good, she's good.

34:10.616 --> 34:12.149
Glad to hear it.

34:14.752 --> 34:15.752
Hi, honey!

34:17.221 --> 34:20.489
This dog is a chick magnet.
You know what that is?

34:20.492 --> 34:20.489
Yeah, I know what that is.

34:20.492 --> 34:24.327
You know what you just did
'cause you're here? What's that?

34:24.329 --> 34:27.563
Cock block. Right, right,
with wife away, it just blew.

34:29.801 --> 34:32.268
So tell me,

34:32.271 --> 34:35.539
what brings my favorite nephew
all the way over to my place,

34:35.541 --> 34:39.543
when his place his only ten
minutes away and I never see him?

34:39.545 --> 34:42.579
What's wrong?
Who said anything was wrong?

34:42.581 --> 34:44.414
I can see it your face.

34:44.416 --> 34:47.117
Same face your father
used to have...

34:47.119 --> 34:48.418
I don't know.

34:48.786 --> 34:50.320
Well, what?

34:52.255 --> 34:56.359
This guy... I backed down
to this messed up guy.

34:56.360 --> 34:57.828
You want me to do
something about this.

34:57.830 --> 35:00.430
No, no.
Uncle Sam, it's not that.

35:00.432 --> 35:03.400
It's, it's just that,
I'm always...

35:06.704 --> 35:08.572
I was actually scared.

35:09.542 --> 35:10.441
I get it.

35:10.442 --> 35:15.645
So instead of him, possibly
beating the shit out of you,

35:15.647 --> 35:19.583
you are beating the shit out of yourself.
Very smart.

35:19.585 --> 35:24.454
Listen to me. You pick the fights.
You don't let fights pick you.

35:24.456 --> 35:28.225
You've always been a smart kid. You
gotta stay smart. You understand me?

35:28.227 --> 35:29.426
Come on.

35:30.728 --> 35:30.727
It's a nice way
of calling me a pussy.

35:30.729 --> 35:34.598
You're not a pussy. Your
daddy didn't raise no pussy.

35:34.600 --> 35:37.234
He was a tough guy.
Yeah, and they wacked him.

35:37.236 --> 35:39.169
They wacked him,
he made a mistake.

35:39.171 --> 35:41.505
But all the guys respected him.
Don't you forget that.

35:43.174 --> 35:45.509
Come on, get out of it!

35:46.210 --> 35:47.744
You got my word.
You got my word.

35:47.746 --> 35:50.614
It's just that, you know,
my dad died and all that,

35:50.616 --> 35:53.850
things just got insane, that's all.
That's all there is.

35:53.852 --> 35:55.485
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I hear you, sal.</i>

35:55.487 --> 35:58.188
My heart bleeds for you.
It really does.

35:58.190 --> 36:00.223
But I want my fucking money now.

36:00.225 --> 36:00.223
You been jerking me off
long enough.

36:00.225 --> 36:04.394
<i>Big ed, a little more time,
that's all I'm asking you for.</i>

36:04.396 --> 36:08.298
Have I not been a god customer? I need you
to think about it for a second, that's all.

36:11.435 --> 36:13.770
Ed?
Big ed?

36:13.772 --> 36:13.770
Yeah, I'm here.

36:13.772 --> 36:17.641
All I was saying was...
If I could just get a, you know

36:17.643 --> 36:20.277
I got the money,
it's not that I don't have it.

36:20.279 --> 36:20.277
You know, I've got
these relatives over the house,

36:20.279 --> 36:23.813
I can't get it all over to you,
you know what I'm saying?

36:23.815 --> 36:25.515
<i>That's the only reason
I'm stalling.</i>

36:26.919 --> 36:30.287
Hey, I must be
some sort of athlete.

36:30.289 --> 36:33.190
I'm sitting on the throne,
I'm talking to you,

36:33.192 --> 36:35.292
blowing my nose
all at the same time.

36:35.294 --> 36:37.527
But do what the fuck
you gotta do, sal.

36:37.529 --> 36:40.797
But bring down the money tomorrow morning.
I'll be at my club.

36:41.566 --> 36:42.632
<i>Okay, I got it.</i>

36:43.801 --> 36:45.468
Hope you shit your liver out.

36:46.904 --> 36:48.772
You fat bastard.

36:58.816 --> 37:00.417
Thank you.

37:00.419 --> 37:02.552
I appreciate you making the trip.
Means a lot.

37:04.288 --> 37:05.522
There he is.
Hey.

37:05.524 --> 37:08.658
Ah, it's been too long.
My condolences, sal.

37:08.660 --> 37:10.260
Now, we're all on the clock.

37:10.262 --> 37:12.329
Yeah, so how you doing?

37:12.964 --> 37:16.700
Ah, there she is.
You got so big!

37:16.702 --> 37:18.501
Such a pretty young lady.

37:18.503 --> 37:21.338
Listen, Connie sends her sympathies.
Sorry she can't be here.

37:21.340 --> 37:22.806
She's has her mother
in the hospital.

37:22.808 --> 37:24.708
She okay?
Yeah, she'll be fine.

37:24.710 --> 37:27.644
It's tough when they get old, huh?
I know, I know.

37:28.946 --> 37:31.982
You're hanging in there?
Me? Yeah.

37:31.984 --> 37:34.351
You know me and him
weren't that close.

37:34.353 --> 37:36.286
And my mom's doing...

37:36.821 --> 37:36.820
She's over there with Jackie.

37:36.822 --> 37:39.789
Did you see the ring
that sal got me.

37:39.791 --> 37:42.559
Let me go pay my respects.
I'll be back. Okay.

37:42.561 --> 37:45.462
Hey, I gotta ask you something.
So you stick around, okay?

37:45.464 --> 37:47.364
All right.
Don't go nowhere.

37:49.500 --> 37:52.402
I know. I'm gonna move your
mother's flowers to the front.

37:58.743 --> 38:00.744
Dominic, hello.

38:00.746 --> 38:02.412
Thanks for coming.

38:02.613 --> 38:02.612
No joke.

38:02.614 --> 38:02.612
It's a good thing people die, or I'll never
have a chance to see you knuckleheads.

38:02.614 --> 38:10.553
Weddings and wakes. Tell you the truth,
dead people in boxes still creeps me out.

38:10.555 --> 38:12.889
What if they turn a nice color?

38:12.891 --> 38:12.889
The deceased.
I have always thought that.

38:12.891 --> 38:16.293
What if they turn a nice color?
Like the leaves in the fall.

38:16.295 --> 38:16.293
See, that would be cool.
Right?

38:16.295 --> 38:19.663
It would be like a drama
to the catskills den, right?

38:19.665 --> 38:19.663
Exactly. In October.

38:19.665 --> 38:24.768
Doesn't Louise look so beautiful laying
there, she turned such a nice golden color...

38:24.770 --> 38:26.469
Fucking gorgeous.
Exactly.

38:26.471 --> 38:28.772
And then we throw up
one more festoonery too.

38:28.774 --> 38:30.440
Autumnal. "Autum-al festival"?

38:30.442 --> 38:31.875
How did you get a diploma?

38:31.877 --> 38:31.875
Fuck ya.

38:31.877 --> 38:35.378
Hey, but sal's holding up
pretty good, huh?

38:35.380 --> 38:37.547
You know sal?
No better than you.

38:37.549 --> 38:39.582
You guys were thick as thieves
back in the day.

38:40.407 --> 38:41.786
It's not for me to say.

38:41.787 --> 38:47.757
But Jackie should try a sentence without
the word "I" in it, once in a while.

38:47.759 --> 38:49.726
I know, I said the same thing.

38:49.728 --> 38:51.795
All she said is, "I, I, I".

38:51.797 --> 38:53.930
I said the exact same thing.

38:53.932 --> 38:53.930
"I this" and "I that".

38:53.932 --> 38:58.601
Maybe I wouldn't mind if she
actually has something to say.

38:58.603 --> 39:00.870
I agree.
I said the exact same thing.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.773
Ready to leave?

39:05.343 --> 39:08.445
Maybe we should say
goodbye to Jackie first.

39:11.682 --> 39:14.484
Yeah, you know,
he's this really cool scientist.

39:14.486 --> 39:16.786
You know, he's this tweaked up
insane pothead.

39:16.788 --> 39:19.556
I see he's...
Was a genius.

39:21.125 --> 39:21.124
For sure, you know, he said...

39:21.126 --> 39:26.663
You ever heard of mensa? You have
to be a genius to be a member.

39:26.665 --> 39:28.998
See that fellow over there?
Yeah.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.700
That's my future son-in-law.

39:31.102 --> 39:33.536
He belongs to feces.

39:33.538 --> 39:35.505
Shit for brains.

39:37.975 --> 39:40.710
No respect.
None.

39:40.712 --> 39:43.713
Fucking kids today, I'd like to
put that stick right up his ass.

39:43.715 --> 39:44.914
With a cellphone chaser.

39:45.850 --> 39:47.851
Right.
Yeah.

39:47.853 --> 39:48.885
Duck face, right now.

40:03.601 --> 40:06.503
Relax, brother.
Take it easy.

40:10.875 --> 40:15.111
I'm suppose sit around all day,
and wait for something to happen.

40:15.113 --> 40:17.514
Shouldn't even be getting involved
with nickel and dime shit

40:17.516 --> 40:19.416
that's going down today,
you understand?

40:22.553 --> 40:24.554
You wanna put
some hair around it?

40:29.593 --> 40:31.895
Let me remind you, brother.

40:31.897 --> 40:35.899
The next time you're not gonna
get so lucky on a technicality.

40:35.901 --> 40:40.570
So get it through
your thick fucking head, okay?

40:40.572 --> 40:43.039
One more charge sticks on
anything, and I mean anything,

40:43.041 --> 40:46.443
they gonna lock your ass up
and throw away the key.

40:46.445 --> 40:47.710
You listening?

40:47.914 --> 40:48.813
Fuck the key!

40:48.814 --> 40:53.450
Well that might be the only
thing you'll be able to fuck.

40:55.619 --> 40:55.618
Well, how long has he been missing?
A day.

40:55.620 --> 40:59.722
Well, that must be your bike with
the pink carrier I saw out front.

40:59.724 --> 41:01.524
It's a girl's bike.
Yes, it is.

41:01.526 --> 41:02.759
What kind is it?
The cat?

41:02.761 --> 41:02.759
No, the bike.
I don't know.

41:02.761 --> 41:06.563
Cats are very smart. I'm sure
he'll find his way home.

41:06.565 --> 41:06.563
Maybe not.
He will.

41:06.565 --> 41:11.201
Mr. Franco looked good, didn't he?
They sure did a nice job.

41:11.203 --> 41:11.201
When you're that old,
the only time

41:11.203 --> 41:14.137
people say you look good
is when you're dead.

41:14.139 --> 41:16.606
What's your cat's name again?
He said it was Leonard.

41:17.007 --> 41:17.006
Leonard.

41:17.008 --> 41:20.610
It's great. It's a great name.
Love that name.

41:42.233 --> 41:44.667
I'll be right back!
One minute!

41:44.669 --> 41:47.504
Hey, thanks for waiting.
Yeah, what's up?

41:47.506 --> 41:51.508
Look, I know it's last minute. And I
wouldn't ask if I wasn't jammed up, but...

41:51.510 --> 41:53.576
I can use your help.
All right, what do you need?

41:56.046 --> 41:58.848
Bye.
Thank you.

41:58.850 --> 42:01.651
I have no idea who that is.
It's about Mary.

42:01.653 --> 42:03.286
Your daughter?
She all right?

42:03.288 --> 42:05.221
She needs an operation.
Ah, shit.

42:05.223 --> 42:08.525
No, dommy, take it easy. It's
not life threatening. It's...

42:09.026 --> 42:10.693
It's a strabismus.

42:11.896 --> 42:13.663
You know, the cross eye.

42:13.665 --> 42:15.832
Oh, sal.
You hardly even notice that.

42:15.834 --> 42:19.002
Isn't it astigmatism? I mean,
you may not see it, but...

42:19.004 --> 42:22.272
True, astigmatism that would be easy.
Strabismus not so much.

42:22.274 --> 42:23.840
Strabismus?

42:23.842 --> 42:25.775
And the other kids,
they all make fun of her.

42:25.777 --> 42:28.611
Mary's a doll, okay.
Fuck those halfwits.

42:28.613 --> 42:28.611
Strabismus?
Yeah.

42:28.613 --> 42:33.883
And the insurance companies, no help. Don't
wanna cover the operation. Believe it?

42:33.885 --> 42:36.886
Bastards don't wanna pay for nothing.
I know.

42:36.888 --> 42:39.756
So, I was a wondering,
you got a minute?

42:39.758 --> 42:42.158
You gotta help him now.
I do not understand.

42:42.160 --> 42:43.960
What?
He's pathetic.

42:43.962 --> 42:45.895
Look, he's an old friend.
What can I do?

42:45.897 --> 42:48.031
You can remind him
that's your father lying there.

42:48.033 --> 42:50.033
I promised I would help him.

42:50.035 --> 42:52.769
This cat is important to him.
It's like his kid or something.

42:52.771 --> 42:56.639
This isn't a big deal. We're gonna ride
around for a little while, all right.

42:56.641 --> 43:00.109
I'll take him to the precinct. We'll put a
buzz out to the units, keep their eyes out.

43:00.111 --> 43:01.177
For a cat!

43:01.179 --> 43:05.081
Ma, do me a favor. Jimmy has
food at the house, okay?

43:05.083 --> 43:08.051
Jackie's gonna take you over.
Please make sure you eat something.

43:08.053 --> 43:09.319
I love you, ma.

43:09.321 --> 43:10.920
You okay?

43:10.922 --> 43:12.789
How can I be okay?

43:12.791 --> 43:14.624
Do you know where my money is?

43:15.659 --> 43:17.093
He left me penniless.

43:18.195 --> 43:19.729
You should have died
ten years ago,

43:19.731 --> 43:22.065
when you were
supposed to, you bastard.

43:22.067 --> 43:25.001
Oh, I lived with
such false hope.

43:25.003 --> 43:27.270
Maybe I could have had
a few more dollars in the bank.

43:27.272 --> 43:29.238
Thank you, sal.
Do you see this?

43:29.240 --> 43:29.238
This is your father's funeral.

43:29.240 --> 43:33.977
I know. I gotta go. Can't go anywhere.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

43:33.979 --> 43:37.313
Ma, everything's gonna be fine. I'm sure
he stashed some money at the house.

43:37.315 --> 43:38.982
We'll look when I get home.
It'll be fun.

43:40.684 --> 43:42.051
- I love you.
- Oh.

43:42.053 --> 43:43.219
I'll be back soon.
Mm.

43:44.822 --> 43:46.689
Do you know where my money is?

43:48.092 --> 43:49.692
On your finger?

43:49.694 --> 43:49.692
Ugh!

43:49.694 --> 43:53.630
Here we go.
Thanks.

43:54.264 --> 43:56.265
Look at that.
Perfect, huh?

43:56.267 --> 43:56.265
Jackie looked pissed.

43:56.267 --> 43:59.769
She'll get over it. Does she
know about, whatever this is?

43:59.771 --> 44:01.671
Nah, I wanna surprise her.

44:01.673 --> 44:03.873
Come on, pal,
first stop Van dam street.

44:04.041 --> 44:05.241
First?

44:08.879 --> 44:10.213
Now, sal,
what's with the mystery?

44:10.215 --> 44:11.681
I said I'd help
whatever this is.

44:11.683 --> 44:13.750
You're gonna see
when we get there.

44:13.752 --> 44:15.718
You know we gotta find Connie's
cat before it gets dark.

44:15.720 --> 44:15.718
I'm dead meat
if I don't find him.

44:15.720 --> 44:15.718
I don't come come with that...
Don't you worry.

44:15.720 --> 44:21.858
You're gonna have plenty of time to find
the cat. Hey, probably home by now, huh?

44:27.998 --> 44:30.233
- Found a guy's ear today.
- No shit.

44:30.235 --> 44:33.136
A dog ate it. So, he probably
doesn't want it back.

44:40.844 --> 44:43.246
Okay...
Handbags.

44:43.248 --> 44:45.214
Handbags?
Designer handbags.

44:45.216 --> 44:47.417
They're knockoffs.
Very popular with the ladies.

44:47.419 --> 44:47.417
Where did you get all this?

44:47.419 --> 44:53.156
They, they made their way onto a
list of confiscated items in a bust.

44:53.158 --> 44:54.957
They're stolen?
Missing!

44:54.959 --> 44:57.427
I don't wanna bother anybody I
work with, and I trust you.

44:57.429 --> 44:59.028
So, how does this help Mary?

44:59.030 --> 44:59.028
I gotta buy it.

44:59.030 --> 45:01.864
Cash! We drop them
off, it's over.

45:01.866 --> 45:05.168
Come on, sal! What? I want you
to take one of these for Connie.

45:06.103 --> 45:09.005
Oh, man, sal, come on!
Look, how pretty.

45:09.007 --> 45:13.142
What? You worry too much. We load
'em and we unload 'em. That's it.

45:14.378 --> 45:16.012
All that's gonna fit
in your truck.

45:20.317 --> 45:21.884
<i>Did you find him yet?</i>

45:21.886 --> 45:23.886
I didn't call, did I?

45:23.888 --> 45:27.490
Maybe he went home, honey.
I haven't been home all day.

45:27.492 --> 45:31.961
Well, just letting you know, she's
out of surgery. She's doing fine.

45:31.963 --> 45:33.296
We're just waiting around
to see her.

45:33.298 --> 45:35.064
All right, good.
That's great.

45:35.066 --> 45:36.199
You go to the wake yet?

45:36.201 --> 45:38.134
Yeah, I'm with sal right now.

45:38.136 --> 45:38.134
He's hanging in there.

45:38.136 --> 45:42.071
All right, well, I don't know
what time I'm gonna get home,

45:42.073 --> 45:46.209
but I guess, I'll look for
Leonard if I have to.

45:47.444 --> 45:49.212
You know,
I didn't need this, Dominic.

45:49.214 --> 45:55.084
Honey, don't cry. Honey, please, please,
you're gonna make yourself sick, all right.

45:55.086 --> 45:58.354
I'll find the cat. Everything's gonna
turn out okay, all right, baby?

45:58.356 --> 46:00.123
<i>I'll find him.</i>

46:00.991 --> 46:02.492
Whatever.

46:02.494 --> 46:02.492
All right, relax.
Talk to you later.

46:02.494 --> 46:09.499
Sal, I gotta find this cat. She's in tears,
with her mom, the cat, the whole thing today.

46:09.501 --> 46:13.102
Dommy, one, two, three, we make the drop.
We find the cat, I promise.

46:13.104 --> 46:14.170
That's it.

46:15.305 --> 46:17.840
Oh, shit.

46:17.842 --> 46:17.840
What the fuck, sal?

46:17.842 --> 46:24.313
Okay, this is not a problem.
Don't you worry about a thing.

46:26.049 --> 46:27.884
How long is this gonna
take now, sal?

46:27.886 --> 46:30.920
Enough with the complaining,
I already got a wife.

46:33.258 --> 46:34.390
Shit!

46:36.994 --> 46:39.362
Everything okay?

46:39.364 --> 46:40.997
Hi, officer, just a flat tire.

46:40.999 --> 46:43.132
You know, you're missing
a license plate on that tow.

46:43.134 --> 46:48.070
I am very sorry about that. My name
is sal and I'm with the one twelve.

46:48.072 --> 46:51.340
I'm just helping a buddy move.
It's a short run.

46:52.409 --> 46:54.377
Best dressed movers
I've ever seen.

46:54.379 --> 46:56.879
Uh, a weak.

46:56.881 --> 46:59.048
- My condolences.
- Thanks.

46:59.050 --> 47:03.119
You know, I got a buddy
over at the one twelve, Reno.

47:03.121 --> 47:05.555
And you admit to know him.

47:05.557 --> 47:07.123
You do know Reno.

47:07.125 --> 47:08.391
All right, you be good.
Take care.

47:08.393 --> 47:10.092
You stay safe, okay?

47:14.898 --> 47:17.867
We're back in business.
That was uncomfortable, sal.

47:17.869 --> 47:21.037
Wait a minute, shoes are uncomfortable.
That was fucking painfully close.

47:21.039 --> 47:23.573
Would you relax?
It's me. I got this.

47:23.575 --> 47:25.308
I got this!

47:25.310 --> 47:28.511
Getting exciting, isn't it?
No. No.

47:28.513 --> 47:31.247
Come on.
Stop fucking around, all right?

47:38.455 --> 47:40.122
You're digging it.

47:40.991 --> 47:42.425
Let me ask you a question.

47:43.594 --> 47:46.329
You think dom's even
looking for Leonard?

47:46.331 --> 47:49.465
He better be, or else he knows
there's a real problem between us.

47:49.467 --> 47:52.168
Huh, really?

47:52.170 --> 47:54.604
What do mean really? What does that mean?
Why are you asking me this?

47:54.606 --> 47:58.407
Well, maybe because you've been
breaking the guy's chops like...

47:59.243 --> 48:00.443
His whole life.

48:00.445 --> 48:03.012
So? That's my job.
I love him.

48:03.014 --> 48:04.513
Who else is supposed to do it?

48:04.515 --> 48:05.948
Hm...

48:09.453 --> 48:13.389
Don't get me wrong, but maybe...

48:13.391 --> 48:17.159
It's dom's way of getting even
with you for doing your job.

48:17.161 --> 48:19.896
What, are you kidding me?
Dom?

48:20.330 --> 48:20.329
Mm-mm.

48:20.331 --> 48:23.532
It's not him.
He doesn't got it in him.

48:23.534 --> 48:26.135
It's not like he's like
his father or anything.

48:27.571 --> 48:31.540
But sometimes, to be honest, I wish
he had a little bit of that in him.

48:31.542 --> 48:35.344
That's not even funny. Like, don't
even say something like that.

48:35.346 --> 48:36.913
You know what I mean.

48:37.581 --> 48:39.048
Look,

48:41.018 --> 48:42.351
I'm not a shrink or nothing.

48:43.020 --> 48:44.487
No shit.

48:44.489 --> 48:46.455
Sometimes, I think...

48:48.025 --> 48:52.061
That dom's whole map up
session thing, you know...

48:54.064 --> 48:56.565
Is just his way of dealing with everything.
It's like...

48:56.567 --> 49:00.403
He's above everything, so he
can look down and feel safe,

49:00.405 --> 49:04.407
and be away from all the
shitheads and guys like his dad.

49:04.409 --> 49:06.976
And you, doctor?

49:07.611 --> 49:09.211
Up your's.

49:12.316 --> 49:13.482
Oh, I know...

49:14.551 --> 49:16.585
It's not like
dom is into sharing,

49:16.587 --> 49:21.090
he's not Mr. like, "oh, you hurt my
feelings... This is what I'm thinking."

49:22.292 --> 49:25.361
I'll tell you one thing. He
better be looking for that cat.

49:25.729 --> 49:27.163
Oh, god.

49:45.415 --> 49:46.549
Two dollars.

50:00.564 --> 50:02.698
Thanks, have a nice day.

50:02.700 --> 50:04.667
Will do.

50:04.669 --> 50:06.402
You have a nice day, too.

50:06.404 --> 50:07.570
Thank you.

50:12.576 --> 50:15.644
So easy. Let me see what you got.
What you get?

50:18.348 --> 50:19.415
Oh, man.

50:19.417 --> 50:19.415
I got more.
Yeah?

50:19.417 --> 50:24.053
That's nice, but I'm not eating anything
that's been in your pants, dude.

50:24.055 --> 50:26.055
All right, more shack for me.

50:59.489 --> 51:01.090
What's going on now?

51:01.092 --> 51:03.259
We're going in stealth.

51:03.261 --> 51:06.629
Sal, they still gonna see your truck.
We're meeting them here?

51:06.631 --> 51:08.364
Him.
We're meeting him here.

51:10.801 --> 51:13.569
Which brings me to asking you
a really big favor.

51:13.571 --> 51:18.074
Now you know, I wouldn't do this unless I was
absolutely sure it was the right way to go.

51:20.677 --> 51:22.678
I'd like you
to make the exchange.

51:22.680 --> 51:24.680
Me?
Nah, I'm not doing it.

51:24.682 --> 51:28.484
Okay, just listen. A, he
doesn't know what I look like.

51:28.486 --> 51:32.088
B, let's say he does make me as a
cop, then this whole thing goes bad.

51:32.823 --> 51:34.623
So that's why I'm here.

51:34.625 --> 51:37.126
It's just like you
to not to tell me till now.

51:37.794 --> 51:37.793
Where the hell are you gonna be?

51:37.795 --> 51:41.397
I'm gonna be right there,
keeping an eye on you.

51:41.399 --> 51:43.833
There's really nothing
to concern yourself about.

51:43.835 --> 51:43.833
This whole thing scares
the shit out of me, sal.

51:43.835 --> 51:48.637
Okay, just stop. That's enough. It's me.
Would I let anything happen to you?

51:48.639 --> 51:50.739
You're gonna be fine.
And you can guarantee that.

51:50.741 --> 51:53.709
It's handbags, for Christ sake.
What are you worried about?

51:55.345 --> 51:57.847
I got to tell you, sal. If it
wasn't for Mary's operation

51:57.849 --> 52:00.683
you're crossing
a fucking line here.

52:00.685 --> 52:04.453
Don't you think I don't know what
a big favor you're doing me?

52:04.455 --> 52:07.256
Don't you think I'm gonna owe
big time for this?

52:10.393 --> 52:11.460
Are we good?

52:36.486 --> 52:37.553
So, we meet.

52:38.421 --> 52:39.688
You're rocky?

52:40.390 --> 52:41.557
Yeah.

52:42.759 --> 52:44.393
I gotta see the bags.

52:48.798 --> 52:51.267
Eighty eight boxes,
and 24 in each.

53:01.745 --> 53:04.213
Women, they,
they love these things.

53:06.550 --> 53:08.250
They love cash, too.

53:10.654 --> 53:12.721
I can be assured this is all
the same merchandise?

53:18.428 --> 53:20.396
Let's get this over with.

53:38.615 --> 53:39.782
This is the last of 'em.

53:40.617 --> 53:42.484
Do you gotta check every box?

53:45.522 --> 53:47.656
Now, who are you?

53:48.892 --> 53:50.793
Hey, hey, no, no, please!

53:51.561 --> 53:53.295
Freeze, dipshit!

53:54.931 --> 53:57.600
So, the real rocky appears.

53:57.602 --> 53:59.868
You were the one
that said, "come alone."

53:59.870 --> 54:03.272
Take the gun.
Take his gun!

54:03.974 --> 54:05.941
It, it isn't loaded.

54:05.943 --> 54:08.744
Yeah, I said "come alone."
But I lied.

54:08.746 --> 54:12.348
But you brought a gun.
Who's a bigger dirtbag now?

54:12.350 --> 54:15.017
How was I supposed to know
who this impostor is?

54:15.019 --> 54:16.585
What would you do?

54:16.821 --> 54:20.756
I don't fucking believe this!

54:20.758 --> 54:21.824
Something like that?

54:23.294 --> 54:24.994
Get in the tuck.

54:24.996 --> 54:29.398
You're lucky I don't take the fucking
bags... Head down! Head down!

54:45.982 --> 54:48.484
Fuck yeah!

54:49.853 --> 54:52.721
You're the man!
You are the man!

54:52.723 --> 54:53.789
Oh-ho!

54:55.925 --> 54:58.827
What, you are not
talking to me now?

54:58.829 --> 55:03.065
You're a maniac! I got a gun pointed at me!
You could have got me killed!

55:03.067 --> 55:06.302
Fuck! Holy fuck, sal!

55:07.904 --> 55:12.308
Rocky? You had a ski mask all the time!
You didn't need me!

55:13.410 --> 55:14.710
Fuck!

55:14.712 --> 55:16.679
Never go in without backup.

55:18.381 --> 55:21.016
I was right, though.
Come on, wasn't I right?

55:21.018 --> 55:23.652
I was right!

55:33.831 --> 55:36.065
Okay, look, look, I'm so sorry
that things went crooked.

55:36.067 --> 55:38.600
But you were a cool, brother.
You were so cool.

55:38.602 --> 55:40.736
Come on, how would it look with
me going in with a ski mask?

55:40.738 --> 55:43.772
Damn it, sal. I'm still shaking here!
That's adrenaline!

55:43.774 --> 55:46.342
You enjoyed it. You're having a good time.
Come on, admit it!

55:46.344 --> 55:48.944
You know what this is? This is the
time when we stole a lawn mover

55:48.946 --> 55:48.944
and tried to make a mini bike.

55:48.946 --> 55:52.881
You stole. You were right there
with me running down the street

55:52.883 --> 55:55.084
with a big smile on your face. I
wanted nothing to do with it.

55:55.086 --> 55:58.087
Come on, come on!
Admit it! Admit it!

55:58.089 --> 55:59.555
And then what happened?

55:59.557 --> 56:01.957
You survived, didn't you?

56:01.959 --> 56:04.393
So you think,
you can outrun me, huh?

56:04.395 --> 56:05.894
Pushing a lawn mover?

56:06.930 --> 56:09.998
Ha-ha!
Shut you, delinquents.

56:10.000 --> 56:13.936
So tell me, John. Who's your friend,
the one who took off on you?

56:15.572 --> 56:17.373
I'm talking to you, John!

56:19.008 --> 56:21.443
His name is Darrell.
Darrell hall.

56:21.445 --> 56:23.812
And you said,
your name's oates, right?

56:23.814 --> 56:26.115
Yeah, my name is John oates.

56:26.117 --> 56:27.783
What the fuck
are you laughing at?

56:33.523 --> 56:34.890
I shouldn't even be talking
to you right now!

56:34.892 --> 56:38.427
Come on. This is some serious
messed up shit, sal.

56:38.429 --> 56:40.629
Dom, dommy, quick!
Look down, look down.

56:40.631 --> 56:42.131
Is that your balls?

56:42.133 --> 56:44.666
That's your balls!
You got them back!

56:48.171 --> 56:51.140
This is like skydiving
without a parachute, my friend.

56:51.142 --> 56:54.510
Then we'd both be dead, sal.
We'd both be dead.

57:09.895 --> 57:10.794
Excuse me.

57:10.795 --> 57:17.466
Yes, I was wondering how much the balloons
are. I can't see a price on them.

57:17.967 --> 57:17.966
Inflated?

57:17.968 --> 57:22.004
No, flat. I'd like to shove
them underneath the door.

57:25.942 --> 57:28.877
I'd like two.
One of each.

57:28.879 --> 57:30.646
Inflated would be great.

57:48.932 --> 57:50.866
You're calling him again?

57:52.535 --> 57:54.036
Would you stop?

58:03.596 --> 58:06.115
Come on, let me get you
something to eat.

58:06.116 --> 58:09.585
My father ain't going anywhere.
Sal, I'm done, all right.

58:09.587 --> 58:09.585
Hey, dommy, you gotta eat.
Come on.

58:09.587 --> 58:14.756
Your blood sugar's gonna drop. You're gonna pass
out on bike. I can't let that happen to you.

58:16.926 --> 58:18.560
There we go.

58:25.969 --> 58:28.070
Thank you.
There you go.

58:29.072 --> 58:30.772
You know what I feel like?

58:31.274 --> 58:31.273
I feel like pancakes.

58:31.275 --> 58:34.776
You know, sal. I'm really not hungry.
I gotta get out of here.

58:34.778 --> 58:37.713
Have something. Listen, you stay.
You eat. I gotta go.

58:37.715 --> 58:40.155
Come on, dommy. Sit down. I wanna
talk to you about something.

58:44.721 --> 58:46.588
I want you to have a cut
of today's transaction.

58:46.590 --> 58:48.590
No way, it's for Mary.

58:48.592 --> 58:48.590
I don't need it all.

58:48.592 --> 58:52.794
Then put it in her college fund, sal.
I'm serious. I mean it. All right?

58:55.798 --> 58:57.733
You know, you always been
a good friend to me.

58:57.735 --> 59:00.135
Now, don't go all,
"I love you, bro", on me now.

59:00.137 --> 59:02.538
Okay?
No, no, I mean it.

59:02.540 --> 59:04.039
You've always been
a good friend.

59:07.010 --> 59:09.945
Look, I gotta tell you something and
I don't want you to be mad at me.

59:10.580 --> 59:11.914
It's about the money.

59:15.885 --> 59:17.553
It's not for Mary.

59:28.598 --> 59:30.933
Dommy, wait. Bitch!

59:30.935 --> 59:30.933
Come on, dom.

59:30.935 --> 59:35.270
Okay, look, I'm sorry. I know, I
shouldn't have told you the truth.

59:35.272 --> 59:35.270
But I was afraid,
you wouldn't help me.

59:35.272 --> 59:40.008
Yeah, that's right, I wouldn't. It's
fucked, sal. What is wrong with you?

59:40.010 --> 59:42.945
What were you thinking? Come
on, dommy, don't be like that.

59:45.148 --> 59:47.316
What were you gonna say the
next time I saw Mary's eyes?

59:47.318 --> 59:49.318
Ah! See, you did notice.

59:49.320 --> 59:51.286
Look, look,
I got a gambling problem, okay?

59:51.288 --> 59:56.592
There, I said it! I owed this torpedo
a leg breaking amount of money, dom.

59:56.594 --> 59:58.660
And I didn't have to
share that with you right now.

59:58.662 --> 01:00:01.797
That's noble of you. You know what,
sal, straighten out your life.

01:00:01.799 --> 01:00:03.832
Do yourself a favor.
Do Mary a favor.

01:00:03.834 --> 01:00:06.068
Just leave me the hell
out of it.

01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:08.870
That's it?
I just opened my heart to you,

01:00:08.872 --> 01:00:10.672
and you're just gonna pedal
right through it.

01:00:10.674 --> 01:00:13.709
Okay, fine! Go ride your
frigging king bike, dom!

01:00:13.711 --> 01:00:15.978
Go find your god damn cat!

01:00:34.864 --> 01:00:37.766
Hey, I'm looking for my cat.
You see him?

01:00:38.101 --> 01:00:39.868
Thanks, thanks a lot.

01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:41.837
Hey, what about you?
You see a cat?

01:00:41.839 --> 01:00:45.073
Anybody seen my fucking cat?
A black cat?

01:00:45.075 --> 01:00:49.244
What are you, like eight
years old, man? Grow up.

01:00:49.246 --> 01:00:51.213
A black cat, ma'am.
Did you see him?

01:00:51.215 --> 01:00:53.248
Simple fucking question, lady.

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:56.284
Ma'am, I'm sorry. I lost my cat.
I'm just upset.

01:00:56.286 --> 01:00:58.687
Understand? Shit.

01:01:02.425 --> 01:01:04.793
Have a good life, Leonard.

01:01:56.446 --> 01:01:58.180
Gets better and better.

01:02:21.838 --> 01:02:24.840
- You're having a nice day?
- Nice day?

01:02:24.842 --> 01:02:27.509
I was chased by a rabid dog,

01:02:27.511 --> 01:02:29.811
I had a pool stick,
almost shoved up into my skull,

01:02:29.813 --> 01:02:32.080
my oldest friend
is a lying prick, and

01:02:32.082 --> 01:02:33.381
I had a gun pulled on me.

01:02:33.383 --> 01:02:35.217
So much good fortune in one day!

01:02:37.787 --> 01:02:39.788
You are still here.

01:02:39.790 --> 01:02:41.289
Life is wonderful.

01:02:42.091 --> 01:02:43.225
Is that what this is?

01:02:47.396 --> 01:02:49.931
Get what you need?
Yeah, thanks.

01:02:49.933 --> 01:02:51.233
What kind of a pet do you have?

01:02:51.235 --> 01:02:53.335
It's a pain in the ass cat,
and he's lost.

01:02:53.337 --> 01:02:54.803
I saw a cat.

01:02:55.772 --> 01:02:58.373
A black cat?
Black as night.

01:02:58.375 --> 01:03:03.145
Just a short while ago, wandering,
appeared very frightened to me.

01:03:03.147 --> 01:03:06.882
Just around the corner.
The alley before 43rd.

01:03:06.884 --> 01:03:08.984
I'll watch your bike.
Go.

01:03:10.119 --> 01:03:12.320
Go!

01:03:30.206 --> 01:03:31.840
What the hell is going on?

01:03:40.016 --> 01:03:41.082
Stop!

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:47.389
What the fuck!

01:03:47.391 --> 01:03:49.024
You got a fucking problem?

01:03:49.026 --> 01:03:51.092
I'm pretty sure that's my cat.

01:03:51.094 --> 01:03:53.195
Well, when you're fucking sure,
come back.

01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:57.265
Give him his cat, man.
Ah, fuck him.

01:03:57.267 --> 01:04:00.168
How do we even know, it's yours?
Don't make me call the police.

01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:02.904
Oh, the police...
Fuck the police!

01:04:02.906 --> 01:04:05.373
Just give my fucking cat!
Or what?

01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:08.877
You're gonna throw another
roll of toilet paper at us?

01:04:16.485 --> 01:04:17.919
Shit.

01:04:19.388 --> 01:04:21.223
You don't got the nads.

01:04:25.061 --> 01:04:26.127
Do it.

01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:29.130
I dare you.

01:04:31.068 --> 01:04:32.234
Fuck.

01:04:32.236 --> 01:04:33.869
We're sorry.

01:04:36.339 --> 01:04:38.306
Crazy asshole, prick!

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:52.420
Where'd you get that?

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:55.323
This?
Give it to me.

01:04:55.591 --> 01:04:57.192
Okay.

01:04:59.362 --> 01:05:02.063
You don't put that on the
ground, you hand it to me!

01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:16.244
Christ!

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:25.580
Lenard. Pss-pss-pss.

01:06:25.582 --> 01:06:27.515
Lenard, lenard, come here.

01:06:34.323 --> 01:06:36.591
I told you. That's real.
That's one of the real shit.

01:06:36.593 --> 01:06:38.126
Fuck.

01:06:42.198 --> 01:06:43.465
Did you give him that bag?

01:06:44.667 --> 01:06:47.002
I thought you gave him the bag.

01:06:47.004 --> 01:06:49.738
Why would I
give him a fucking bag?

01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:51.539
It's a fucking bag, then.

01:06:52.408 --> 01:06:55.076
The fucking bag, jeez!

01:07:01.183 --> 01:07:02.784
Sir, please stop right there.

01:07:02.786 --> 01:07:04.219
What's the hurry?

01:07:05.755 --> 01:07:07.589
I didn't know it was loaded.

01:07:07.591 --> 01:07:09.024
Loaded?

01:07:09.759 --> 01:07:12.427
Hey, aren't you that guy
from earlier today?

01:07:12.429 --> 01:07:14.396
You're moving...

01:07:14.398 --> 01:07:16.498
You're friends with the officer
from one twelve.

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:20.168
Oh, yes, yes, that's me. That's sal.
He's my best friend. He's a cop.

01:07:20.170 --> 01:07:23.571
I was just looking for him. He ran off.
He was just spooked by the move.

01:07:23.573 --> 01:07:25.707
But, I got him.
I'm good, thanks.

01:07:25.709 --> 01:07:28.276
There's been a number
of break-ins lately, so,

01:07:28.278 --> 01:07:31.046
people get nervous when someone
goes tracking through their yards.

01:07:31.048 --> 01:07:33.515
I'm sorry if I was any trouble.

01:07:33.517 --> 01:07:36.718
Well, officer,
there is one thing...

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:36.718
I gotta remain
anonymous on this,

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:42.424
but I'm telling you, I happened on a major
drug deal or some kind of deal going on,

01:07:42.426 --> 01:07:45.060
just right around the corner.
I'm talking a truckload full of,

01:07:45.062 --> 01:07:47.228
a white truck.

01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:49.431
You sure? Oh, yeah, I
couldn't be more sure.

01:07:50.166 --> 01:07:52.333
All right, thanks.
Thank you.

01:07:59.275 --> 01:08:03.311
He's a very beautiful cat.
I'm so pleased I could help.

01:08:03.746 --> 01:08:03.745
Here, for you.

01:08:03.747 --> 01:08:07.282
Please, no.
No reward is necessary.

01:08:07.284 --> 01:08:09.084
No, I'm good.
Thank you. Appreciate it.

01:08:09.086 --> 01:08:12.287
Is this real?
Hello, is this real!

01:08:26.801 --> 01:08:28.368
Yeah!

01:08:29.270 --> 01:08:32.439
Fuck them! Fuck them all, man!
Fuck 'em all!

01:08:38.447 --> 01:08:41.582
I'm telling you. We weren't doing anything.
Check this shit out.

01:08:41.585 --> 01:08:43.417
Watch the mouth!

01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:45.185
You shouldn't have
even been out there.

01:08:45.188 --> 01:08:48.456
Okay, this a-hole,
just shot at us, see?

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:48.456
He just missed me.

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:53.361
Well, it's good thing you take
after your father in that area.

01:08:53.363 --> 01:08:55.462
Or you'd be in the hospital
right now.

01:08:55.465 --> 01:08:55.462
Mom!

01:08:55.465 --> 01:09:00.401
What did he look like? I don't
know, it was an old white dude.

01:09:03.471 --> 01:09:05.740
What's this?

01:09:05.742 --> 01:09:08.609
He went out today,
and got shot at.

01:09:09.612 --> 01:09:11.145
You probably deserved it.

01:09:12.747 --> 01:09:14.682
What, you brought me a knockoff?

01:09:21.291 --> 01:09:26.294
I'm I happy now? Fuck
you, am I my happy now!

01:09:27.796 --> 01:09:29.363
I'll fucking tell mom.

01:09:31.768 --> 01:09:34.269
I got him. We're home.
I told you.

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:36.904
Where did you find him?
Oh, my god, is he all right?

01:09:36.907 --> 01:09:36.904
Yeah, he was over by the cleaners.
He's great.

01:09:36.907 --> 01:09:41.376
What the hell was he doing all the
way over there? I'm gonna kill him.

01:09:41.377 --> 01:09:43.944
Oh, my god, I can't believe it.
Downtown Leonard.

01:09:43.947 --> 01:09:43.944
Hey, how's mom?

01:09:43.947 --> 01:09:47.749
She's doing okay.
I mean, she's good.

01:09:47.751 --> 01:09:50.752
She's a little out of it. They
gotta keep her here tonight.

01:09:50.754 --> 01:09:54.221
Oh my god, I'm so frigging relieved!
You wanna say hi? Here.

01:09:54.224 --> 01:09:55.657
Ma, say hi to dom.

01:09:57.459 --> 01:10:01.262
Hey, ma, long day today, huh?
You okay?

01:10:01.264 --> 01:10:03.965
My balloon's are shriveled.
Oh, my god.

01:10:03.967 --> 01:10:06.734
Your balloons?
That's because they're old.

01:10:06.736 --> 01:10:08.503
They won't stay up, that's why.

01:10:08.505 --> 01:10:10.805
Give me the phone.
Give me the phone!

01:10:10.807 --> 01:10:12.941
Okay, thanks for calling.
Thank you.

01:10:12.943 --> 01:10:12.941
There's no pleasing her.

01:10:12.943 --> 01:10:18.213
<i>Listen, I'm gonna be home soon.
Make sure he eats, okay?</i>

01:10:19.381 --> 01:10:21.649
All right, honey. Listen, be
careful while driving, okay?

01:10:21.651 --> 01:10:25.687
I'll see you when you get home.
That's great. All right, bye-bye.

01:10:25.689 --> 01:10:28.957
These balloon's are not old.
I just got them for you.

01:10:28.959 --> 01:10:32.260
Why do you gotta make up stuff that you
don't know you're talking about, huh?

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:36.831
Found Leonard! Yes!

01:10:42.838 --> 01:10:44.439
Dominic?

01:10:46.308 --> 01:10:48.476
- Hey!
- Hey!

01:10:48.478 --> 01:10:51.412
You find him? Yeah, yeah, I got him.
He's good.

01:10:51.414 --> 01:10:53.681
Ah, see that map helped you out.

01:10:53.683 --> 01:10:55.783
I bet Connie loves you.
A little bit.

01:10:55.785 --> 01:10:59.287
How's her mom? She's good. Listen, thanks.
She's great.

01:10:59.289 --> 01:11:01.556
I've had one fuck of a day.
You have no idea.

01:11:01.558 --> 01:11:04.459
All right, I got to take care of some shit.
I'm sorry if I'm being...

01:11:04.461 --> 01:11:07.362
That's cool. Listen, I just came
by to see how you made out.

01:11:07.364 --> 01:11:08.563
I appreciate it, brother.

01:11:08.565 --> 01:11:12.734
Hey, whatever happened
with the ear thing?

01:11:12.736 --> 01:11:14.002
What are you talking about?

01:11:14.004 --> 01:11:16.604
All right, I got you.
Thanks, ponce.

01:11:16.606 --> 01:11:18.539
Okay, man. All right.
All right, brother.

01:11:42.998 --> 01:11:45.600
Pick up your god damn mind.

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:27.075
Boy, who's mamma's best boy?

01:12:27.077 --> 01:12:31.346
You're very naughty. You're very
naughty, having an adventure.

01:12:31.348 --> 01:12:33.815
Oh, yes, I missed you.

01:12:33.817 --> 01:12:36.818
You're my sweetheart.
You're my sweetheart.

01:12:38.354 --> 01:12:42.490
Oh, what a day. Between
Leonard missing, my mother.

01:12:42.958 --> 01:12:44.759
I am exhausted.

01:12:47.963 --> 01:12:48.996
Oh!

01:12:48.998 --> 01:12:51.632
You know what
Nora asked me today?

01:12:53.702 --> 01:12:54.869
Hello?

01:12:57.506 --> 01:13:00.141
Mcfly, you're there?

01:13:00.143 --> 01:13:02.443
Yeah, what's up?

01:13:03.545 --> 01:13:05.913
I'm sorry I was such
a pain in the ass today.

01:13:06.448 --> 01:13:09.050
You?
Pain in the ass?

01:13:09.052 --> 01:13:12.420
I know dealing with
your mother was not fun.

01:13:12.422 --> 01:13:15.523
Well, it was a ball. You missed
the good time. Trust me.

01:13:17.159 --> 01:13:19.460
I got to drop something
off at Jimmy pipes.

01:13:19.728 --> 01:13:21.529
Now?
Now.

01:13:21.964 --> 01:13:23.498
I won't be long.

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:24.565
Mm.

01:13:39.648 --> 01:13:41.015
Dom!
Jimmy.

01:13:41.017 --> 01:13:42.884
What's up?
Sorry, I'm so late.

01:13:42.886 --> 01:13:44.619
No, no, I'm up.
What?

01:13:44.621 --> 01:13:46.954
I, uh...
I just couldn't wait.

01:13:48.457 --> 01:13:50.425
Look at this.
What's this?

01:13:52.995 --> 01:13:55.963
Jesus Christ!

01:13:55.965 --> 01:13:57.498
Where'd you get this?

01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.567
It's a long story.

01:13:59.569 --> 01:14:02.603
The kid got away, but what's
important is you got that back.

01:14:03.906 --> 01:14:06.774
You're the only one who should
be wearing that, Jimmy.

01:14:06.776 --> 01:14:09.777
This is the only thing they took
that meant anything to me.

01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:11.846
I never thought
I'd see it again.

01:14:12.881 --> 01:14:14.482
Thanks, dom.

01:14:16.952 --> 01:14:18.519
God, thank you, I...

01:14:19.755 --> 01:14:22.723
Listen, Connie's waiting for me.
I gotta go,

01:14:23.492 --> 01:14:25.159
but just feel good, Jimmy, okay?

01:14:25.161 --> 01:14:27.795
Well, hell, yes!

01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:30.631
Hey, Jimmy...
Yeah?

01:14:30.633 --> 01:14:32.800
Do you mind if
I ask you something else?

01:14:32.802 --> 01:14:34.535
Oh, sure.

01:14:35.571 --> 01:14:41.008
Were you ever afraid,
you know, scared, over there?

01:14:43.979 --> 01:14:46.581
Afraid?

01:14:46.583 --> 01:14:49.517
Listen, Jimmy, if I'm out of line...
No, no, no.

01:14:51.253 --> 01:14:55.756
I guess, I'd say we were
intensely aware.

01:14:59.795 --> 01:15:02.563
When push comes to shove, you
do what you gotta, you know?

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:06.501
Right.

01:15:06.503 --> 01:15:08.569
Thanks so much, dom.
Thank you, Jimmy.

01:15:08.571 --> 01:15:10.671
You don't know
how much this means to me.

01:15:10.673 --> 01:15:13.040
Feel good, Jimmy, all right?
All right, god bless you.

01:15:13.976 --> 01:15:15.576
Jesus Christ!

01:15:31.994 --> 01:15:33.594
You awake?

01:15:34.563 --> 01:15:36.063
No, I'm sleeping.

01:15:39.067 --> 01:15:40.835
Mm, Leonard.

01:15:41.803 --> 01:15:43.738
Did you give
whatever you had to give

01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:46.574
to whoever
it was, Mr. secretive?

01:15:47.042 --> 01:15:48.709
Yep, I did.

01:15:58.654 --> 01:16:00.788
What are you doing?
Turn off the hall light.

01:16:03.625 --> 01:16:05.092
Do you wanna flatter me?

01:16:05.094 --> 01:16:06.160
Flatter you?

01:16:07.162 --> 01:16:08.930
What are you talking about?

01:16:10.065 --> 01:16:11.933
Or I can flatter you.

01:16:20.609 --> 01:16:21.876
Hey, baby girl.

01:17:20.302 --> 01:17:22.203
Take it.
No.

01:17:22.205 --> 01:17:23.804
Dominic, come on, hold it.

01:17:25.841 --> 01:17:28.109
It's not gonna bite you.
Take it.

01:17:28.111 --> 01:17:29.644
I don't want it.

01:17:29.646 --> 01:17:30.911
Come on, hold it.

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:31.679
All right, come here.

01:17:31.681 --> 01:17:37.385
Take it in your hands. Not like a
wimp, like a man. See? And hold it.

01:17:37.387 --> 01:17:37.385
Like that!
Just like that!

01:17:37.387 --> 01:17:42.056
What are you, stupid? What do you
mean, stupid? It's not loaded.

01:17:42.058 --> 01:17:44.659
This is what you're teaching him?
How to be like you?

01:17:44.661 --> 01:17:46.394
He has to learn to be a man.

01:17:46.396 --> 01:17:48.129
He's a baby, for Christ sake!

01:17:48.131 --> 01:17:50.765
A baby! You're turning
him into god damn sissy!

01:17:51.833 --> 01:17:51.832
I'm not a sissy.
A sissy Dominic.

01:17:51.834 --> 01:17:57.304
You're turning into a sissy boy. Your
mother's making you into a sissy boy.

01:17:57.306 --> 01:17:57.304
Let's go in
the kitchen, sweetheart.

01:17:57.306 --> 01:18:02.243
Yeah, take him into the kitchen. Make him
some milk and cookies while you're at it.

01:18:02.245 --> 01:18:04.245
Up yours!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:18:52.327 --> 01:18:54.762
<i>In queens,
the police have discovered</i>

01:18:54.764 --> 01:18:58.199
<i>the body of an unidentified man
near the flushing creek.</i>

01:18:58.201 --> 01:19:00.935
<i>There are early reports that
his ears have been severed.</i>

01:19:00.937 --> 01:19:00.935
Both?

01:19:00.937 --> 01:19:00.935
<i>Earlier in Brooklyn, residents
were awakened by sound of gun fire</i>

01:19:00.937 --> 01:19:08.937
<i>when a fight broke out in a bar and carried
unto the street early this morning.</i>

01:19:10.011 --> 01:19:11.912
<i>In other news...</i>

01:19:26.484 --> 01:19:27.863
Yes, so the problem is,

01:19:27.864 --> 01:19:31.799
I got the order, four trucks. I
need four trucks for the job.

01:19:31.801 --> 01:19:34.368
Jimmy calls in, like a
half hour late, checks in,

01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:37.071
I got a truck down
on the bqe, now.

01:19:50.018 --> 01:19:51.118
Hey, Sam.

01:20:08.904 --> 01:20:11.539
Long day, Sam.
Yeah, you ain't lying.

01:20:11.541 --> 01:20:14.074
Hell of a day, dom. I've had it, man.
I'm gonna get home now.

01:20:14.076 --> 01:20:15.276
Thank you, man.
Take it easy.

01:20:15.278 --> 01:20:17.077
All right, thank you.

01:20:47.609 --> 01:20:51.212
<i>Maybe someday I'll tell
Connie about what happened.</i>

01:20:51.214 --> 01:20:53.380
<i>Jesus, if that bullet
hit that kid.</i>

01:20:54.583 --> 01:20:56.884
<i>Push come to shove is right.</i>

01:20:56.886 --> 01:20:59.086
<i>Was it me or the gun?</i>

<i>Maybe my father was right
on how to deal with this world.</i>

01:21:03.526 --> 01:21:05.993
<i>Mad jackass,
look where it got him.</i>

01:21:11.566 --> 01:21:14.435
What the fuck.
I'm good.

01:21:19.207 --> 01:21:20.307
I'm good.
