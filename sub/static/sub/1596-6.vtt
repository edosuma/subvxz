44:25.292 --> 44:26.834
OR SOMETHING.

44:26.834 --> 44:28.041
- I DON'T KNOW
WHY I CAN'T DRINK.

44:28.041 --> 44:29.250
- OKAY, SHUT UP!
IT'S HARD FOR ALL OF US.

44:29.250 --> 44:30.667
SO BOTH OF YOU, SHUT UP!

44:30.667 --> 44:33.917
NOW EVERYONE
GET IN YOUR POSITIONS.

44:33.917 --> 44:35.126
[snapping fingers]

44:43.709 --> 44:47.542
- ALL RIGHT.

44:47.542 --> 44:50.667
[sighs]

44:50.667 --> 44:52.792
OH, COME ON, MAN!

44:52.792 --> 44:54.333
DON'T DO THIS,
YOU PIECE OF SHIT!

44:54.333 --> 44:56.125
YOU GET HARD WHEN
YOU SMELL PORK CHOPS.

44:56.125 --> 44:57.333
- YELLING AT IT
IS NOT GONNA HELP.

44:57.333 --> 44:59.458
COME HERE.

45:03.500 --> 45:07.959
- OH, THERE WE GO.

45:07.959 --> 45:09.750
- OW!
- COME ON, YOU PIECE OF SHIT!

45:09.750 --> 45:12.168
- OW! OW! OW! OW!
GOD, BABY! YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

45:12.168 --> 45:13.417
YOU'RE GONNA
BUILD UP CALLUSES

45:13.417 --> 45:15.084
AND I WON'T BE ABLE
TO FEEL DICK.

45:15.084 --> 45:16.667
- WELL, RIGHT NOW,
NO ONE'S FEELING DICK!

45:16.667 --> 45:19.458
- YOU THINK THIS IS EASY?
- IT'S ALL MY FAULT!

45:19.458 --> 45:22.042
YOU CAN'T MAKE
THE LITTLE SOLDIER SALUTE

45:22.042 --> 45:26.041
IF HE DOESN'T SEE AN OFFICER
IN THE ROOM.

45:26.041 --> 45:28.834
[cries]
I'VE LOST ALL MY STRIPES.

45:28.834 --> 45:31.834
- MAMA, THIS IS NOT
ABOUT YOU LOSING ANYTHING.

45:31.834 --> 45:33.959
- [cries]

45:33.959 --> 45:35.917
- IT'S REALLY ME.
I'M UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE.

45:35.917 --> 45:37.375
- NO.
- IT'S ALL ME, MAMA.

45:37.375 --> 45:39.542
- I HAVEN'T HAD A DATE
IN MONTHS!

45:39.542 --> 45:44.041
I'M OLD AND FAT
AND UNATTRACTIVE

45:44.041 --> 45:47.959
AND I'M GONNA DIE ALONE.

45:47.959 --> 45:52.250
- OH, MAMA.
- [cries]

45:52.250 --> 45:54.083
- WELL, THIS IS NOT
HELPING ME GET HARD.

45:54.083 --> 45:57.584
- [cries]

45:57.584 --> 46:00.375
- [sighs] IT'S LIKE
WHEN A PLANE GOES DOWN.

46:00.375 --> 46:03.876
WHAT DO THEY CALL THAT?
- SHITTY?

46:03.876 --> 46:06.084
- NO, IT'S NEVER JUST
ONE THING THAT CAUSES IT.

46:06.084 --> 46:08.709
IT'S A CHAIN REACTION.

46:08.709 --> 46:11.500
CASCADING FAILURES.
THAT'S WHAT THIS FEELS LIKE.

46:11.500 --> 46:13.292
LOSING MY JOB,
LOSING THE KIDS,

46:13.292 --> 46:16.292
DEALING WITH FRANK.

46:16.292 --> 46:17.750
[sighs]

46:17.750 --> 46:22.168
- SOMEONE RECENTLY TOLD ME
TO STOP WHINING

46:22.168 --> 46:24.542
AND FEELING SORRY FOR MYSELF.

46:24.542 --> 46:27.417
- [chuckles]
SHE SOUNDS LIKE A BITCH.

46:27.417 --> 46:31.208
- WELL, SHE HAS HER MOMENTS.

46:41.168 --> 46:44.041
- LEGALLY AND MORALLY THERE ARE
ACCEPTABLE METHODS OF PUNISHMENT

46:44.041 --> 46:48.333
FOR CHILDREN,
VERSUS UNACCEPTABLE METHODS.

46:48.333 --> 46:51.041
- UH, I'M SORRY.

46:51.041 --> 46:54.709
JUST HYPOTHETICALLY, IF ONE'S
TEENAGE DAUGHTER GAVE BIRTH

46:54.709 --> 46:57.792
TO A BABY WITH DOWNS SYNDROME
AND THEN TOOK OFF,

46:57.792 --> 47:00.250
RELIEVING HER
OF ALL RESPONSIBILITY,

47:00.250 --> 47:02.166
IF AND WHEN
SHE SHOULD COME BACK,

47:02.166 --> 47:04.292
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND GROUNDING?

47:04.292 --> 47:10.126
OR IN THAT INSTANCE WOULD
A FIRM SPANKING BE MORE...

47:10.126 --> 47:12.500
- YOU KNOW, BEFORE
WE TAKE ANY MORE QUESTIONS,

47:12.500 --> 47:14.667
LET'S JUST GO OVER SOME
OF THE BASIC...

47:14.667 --> 47:17.917
- WOULD YOU GIVE ME A VALIUM?
- NO, I ONLY HAVE ONE.

47:17.917 --> 47:21.959
AND IT'S MY SAFETY NET IN CASE
MY HYPNOTHERAPY DOESN'T WORK.

47:21.959 --> 47:24.834
- HYPNOTHERAPY IS JUST PAYING
TO NAP IN SOMEONE'S OFFICE.

47:24.834 --> 47:26.250
GIVE ME A PILL.

47:26.250 --> 47:28.208
- IT'S GONNA SHOW UP
IN YOUR URINE TEST.

47:28.208 --> 47:30.333
- GIVE ME THE GODDAMN PILL.
- WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

47:30.333 --> 47:31.959
- WHAT THIS DOES IS IT
PUTS THE RESPONSIBILITY

47:31.959 --> 47:34.041
RIGHT ON THE CHILD.
- OKAY. COME ON.

47:34.041 --> 47:36.084
- YOUR JOB AS PARENTS
IS TO DEFINE THE RULES...

47:36.084 --> 47:37.625
- HERE. CHRIST.
- AND THEN LAY OUT

47:37.625 --> 47:39.333
THE CONSEQUENCES
THAT WILL FOLLOW

47:39.333 --> 47:41.625
WHEN THOSE RULES
ARE BROKEN.

47:41.625 --> 47:43.625
NOW THE CHILD BREAKING THE RULES
IS THEN RESPONSIBLE

47:43.625 --> 47:45.917
FOR HIS OR HER
OWN CONSEQUENCES.

47:45.917 --> 47:48.834
AND THIS METHOD ACTUALLY
LEADS TO EMPOWERMENT

47:48.834 --> 47:52.083
AND HELPS HIM OR HER FEEL MORE
IN CONTROL OF THEIR OWN LIVES.

47:52.083 --> 47:55.168
- HOW IS SHE STILL OVULATING?
WHAT IS SHE, PART BOVINE?

47:55.168 --> 47:57.792
- SHH. FOCUS ON ME.
- MM.

47:57.792 --> 48:00.792
- YEAH, NOW YOU'RE GONNA PRETEND
LIKE YOU'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL

48:00.792 --> 48:03.001
AND YOU'RE GONNA COME QUICKLY
LIKE A RABBIT, OKAY?

48:03.001 --> 48:04.876
- OOH, YEAH.
- NO, NOT THAT QUICK.

48:04.876 --> 48:07.001
MAMA, GET IN HERE!

48:08.250 --> 48:10.625
- MM.

48:13.041 --> 48:14.876
- [grunts]

48:14.876 --> 48:17.166
NO. NOT THERE, HONEY, NO.
- OH, SORRY, SORRY, SORRY.

48:17.166 --> 48:19.166
- YOU GOTTA SHOEHORN
OR SOMETHING?

48:19.166 --> 48:21.917
- CAN YOU NOT TALK, PLEASE?
JUST DON'T SAY A WORD.

48:24.084 --> 48:28.250
- [cries]

48:28.250 --> 48:31.042
- ARE YOU CRYING?
OH, GOD, SHE'S CRYING.

48:31.042 --> 48:33.417
PLEASE DON'T CRY.
I'M SORRY, OKAY?

48:33.417 --> 48:35.834
I'M SORRY, MAMA.
HEY, HEY, HEY.

48:35.834 --> 48:37.667
- OKAY! THAT'S IT!

48:37.667 --> 48:39.542
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS SHIT
AND WE'RE GONNA BE DONE WITH IT.

48:39.542 --> 48:41.168
KEV, GET THAT DICK HARD.

48:41.168 --> 48:43.042
MAMA, WIPE YOUR
TEARS AND FOCUS!

48:43.042 --> 48:45.126
WE NEED TO GIVE THOSE LITTLE
SPERMIES SOMEPLACE HAPPY

48:45.126 --> 48:46.126
TO SWIM TO.

48:46.126 --> 48:47.168
LAY DOWN!

48:47.168 --> 48:49.834
- [groans]

48:49.834 --> 48:51.292
MM.

48:51.292 --> 48:54.250
- MAMA, GET ON IT.
- MM.

48:59.500 --> 49:02.250
MM. MM!

49:03.709 --> 49:08.000
[muffled groaning]

49:08.000 --> 49:11.126
- AAH!
- MM.

49:11.126 --> 49:12.041
UH-HUH.

49:12.041 --> 49:13.083
- OOH!

49:13.083 --> 49:14.458
- MM! MM! MM!

49:14.458 --> 49:19.084
[all passionately moaning]

49:19.084 --> 49:21.625
- HI.

49:21.625 --> 49:24.126
I'M MONICA.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

49:28.001 --> 49:32.042
FRANK, WASN'T THE LAST TIME
I HAD TO PEE IN A CUP

49:32.042 --> 49:34.834
WHEN I WAS PREGNANT WITH LIAM?

49:34.834 --> 49:38.125
REMEMBER THAT?
IT WAS JUST LIKE YESTERDAY, HUH?

49:38.125 --> 49:42.208
OH.

50:29.084 --> 50:32.792
- UH, SORRY, THE SHOWER
RAN OUT OF HOT WATER.

50:34.375 --> 50:36.458
- MAMA, YOU WANT KEVIN
TO TAKE YOU HOME?

50:36.458 --> 50:38.168
- WELL, HE CAN'T DRIVE
WITH THAT LEG.

50:38.168 --> 50:40.126
- NO, BUT HE CAN GET
YOU HOME IN A TAXI.

50:40.126 --> 50:42.292
IT'S THE LEAST
WE CAN DO.

50:42.292 --> 50:45.375
- WELL, LET ME GET MY BAG.

50:45.375 --> 50:49.001
[knock at door]

50:49.001 --> 50:51.000
- HEY, CAROL.
- HEY, FIONA.

50:51.000 --> 50:54.500
- ANY WORK AT THE SALON?
- UH, NOT RIGHT NOW, BABY.

50:54.500 --> 50:56.417
BUT I'LL KEEP YOU IN MIND.
- THANKS.

50:59.125 --> 51:00.375
[door closes]

51:00.375 --> 51:01.917
WHAT WAS SHE DOING HERE
SO EARLY?

51:01.917 --> 51:03.876
- SHE SLEPT OVER
AFTER SHE AND KEVIN HAD SEX.

51:03.876 --> 51:05.125
- WHAT?

51:05.125 --> 51:06.208
- MAMA'S THE BEST SURROGATE
WE GOT.

51:06.208 --> 51:07.709
TURKEY BASTER DIDN'T WORK

51:07.709 --> 51:09.458
SO WE HAD TO DO IT
THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY.

51:09.458 --> 51:12.083
- JESUS, V, I'M SO WRAPPED UP
IN MY OWN PITY PARTY,

51:12.083 --> 51:14.083
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT KIND
OF BIBLICAL SHIT

51:14.083 --> 51:16.917
YOU HAD GOING ON HERE.

51:16.917 --> 51:18.125
YOU OKAY?

51:18.125 --> 51:20.917
- IF IT WORKS, I'LL BE FINE.

51:22.584 --> 51:24.209
HOW'S FRANK DOING IN REHAB?

51:24.209 --> 51:26.375
- SO FAR HE SEEMS
TO BE HOLDING IT TOGETHER.

51:26.375 --> 51:28.042
HEADING OVER TO DFS NOW
TO MAKE SURE

51:28.042 --> 51:29.333
HE GOT ALL
THE PAPERWORK IN.

51:29.333 --> 51:30.917
WHAT'S WITH ALL THE ASPARAGUS?

51:30.917 --> 51:32.500
- YOU KNOW HOW POPEYE
GETS ALL BIG AND STRONG

51:32.500 --> 51:33.709
WHEN HE EATS HIS SPINACH?

51:33.709 --> 51:35.209
- MM-HM.

51:35.209 --> 51:38.209
- THAT'S WHAT ASPARAGUS
DOES FOR SPERM.

51:38.209 --> 51:40.166
- HM.

51:45.208 --> 51:47.500
- YOU AGAIN.
- ME AGAIN.

51:47.500 --> 51:49.208
JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
FRANK SHOWED UP

51:49.208 --> 51:51.083
AND ALL OUR PAPERWORK
WAS GOOD TO GO.

51:51.083 --> 51:53.750
- HE DID. HE PASSED HIS
URINE TEST WITH FLYING COLORS.

51:53.750 --> 51:57.083
AND YES, YOUR PAPERWORK
IS ALL SET.

51:57.083 --> 52:00.292
- SO NOW WE JUST WAIT
FOR A HEARING?

52:00.292 --> 52:02.000
- YEAH.

52:02.000 --> 52:06.168
YOU'VE DONE GOOD, FIONA.
YOU ARE A GREAT SISTER.

52:06.168 --> 52:09.625
AND THOSE KIDS
ARE LUCKY TO HAVE YOU.

52:14.959 --> 52:17.792
- HOW DID WE SHOW UP
ON DFS RADAR?

52:17.792 --> 52:21.250
- IT WAS AN ANONYMOUS
PHONE CALL, ACTUALLY.

52:21.250 --> 52:23.126
- [chuckles]
I BET IT WAS THAT BITCH

52:23.126 --> 52:25.083
WE TURNED AWAY FROM DAYCARE
'CAUSE HER KID STUNK.

52:25.083 --> 52:29.292
- UM, NO.

52:29.292 --> 52:32.542
IT WAS A MAN, ACTUALLY.
- A MAN?

52:32.542 --> 52:35.959
IT'S NEVER A MAN.
MEN DON'T GIVE A SHIT.

52:37.750 --> 52:39.542
HOW IS IT FAIR THAT SOMEONE
CAN MAKE ONE CALL

52:39.542 --> 52:42.458
AND COMPLETELY RUIN OUR LIVES,
AND THEY GET TO BE ANONYMOUS?

52:46.500 --> 52:48.250
- I HAVE TO GO
TO THE RESTROOM.

52:48.250 --> 52:50.375
I'D APPRECIATE IT
IF YOU DIDN'T CLICK ON THIS FILE

52:50.375 --> 52:54.209
WHILE I'M GONE.

53:15.417 --> 53:18.125
Frank: YES, HELLO,
I WOULD LIKE TO REPORT

53:18.125 --> 53:22.042
A NEGLIGENT SITUATION.

53:22.042 --> 53:25.168
2119 NORTH WALLACE.

53:25.168 --> 53:26.709
GALLAGHER.

53:26.709 --> 53:28.250
female:
AND WHAT'S THE SITUATION?

53:28.250 --> 53:30.959
Frank: SIX KIDS LIVING
IN SQUALOR.

53:30.959 --> 53:32.750
NO PARENTAL SUPERVISION.

53:32.750 --> 53:36.126
WHEN THE FATHER IS THERE,
HE'S DRUNK.

53:36.126 --> 53:41.084
HE HITS THEM.
NOT THAT THEY DON'T DESERVE IT.

53:41.084 --> 53:44.001
THEY'RE ALL CRIMINALS,
DELINQUENTS, VILE--

53:44.001 --> 53:45.375
female: EXCUSE ME, SIR.
Frank: WHAT?

53:45.375 --> 53:46.709
female: COULD YOU GIVE ME
YOUR NAME, PLEASE?

53:46.709 --> 53:48.001
Frank: NO.
IF IT'S ALL RIGHT,

53:48.001 --> 53:49.584
I WOULD LIKE
TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS.

53:49.584 --> 53:51.375
female: THANK YOU FOR BRINGING
THIS TO OUR ATTENTION.

53:51.375 --> 53:55.209
Frank: NO. THANK YOU.
AND GOD BLESS YOU.
