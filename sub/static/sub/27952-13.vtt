00:06.548 --> 00:09.217
It was really cool of Victor
to invite us to his wedding.

00:09.426 --> 00:11.386
You're his ex-wife's landlord,

00:11.594 --> 00:15.223
and I'm his ex-mother-in-law's
non-sexual, platonic companion.

00:16.349 --> 00:18.059
We're practically family.

00:19.978 --> 00:22.397
But, are you going to be okay?

00:23.314 --> 00:25.817
I-- I mean, with all that alcohol around.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.027
Oh. Yeah.

00:27.610 --> 00:28.903
Thirty days sober.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.989
I'm starting to feel like myself again.

00:31.322 --> 00:33.033
I just wish Avery was coming.

00:33.116 --> 00:35.326
-You still haven't heard from her?
-No.

00:35.493 --> 00:37.912
I tried everything. Calling, texting,

00:37.996 --> 00:42.083
a plane in the sky with a banner
that said, "I love Avery. Sorry, baby."

00:43.585 --> 00:44.586
But they spaced it wrong,

00:44.669 --> 00:47.797
so it just said,
"I love a very sorry baby."

00:52.886 --> 00:54.596
Anyway, I think it's over.

00:55.805 --> 00:57.098
It is never over.

01:00.477 --> 01:03.354
There will be many single ladies
at the wedding today,

01:03.438 --> 01:05.899
and I will find you the perfect match.

01:05.982 --> 01:08.359
I even put it in my bouquet list.

01:09.694 --> 01:14.240
Lydia, I don't want to sound too forward,
but... [purrs]

01:15.450 --> 01:17.911
[sighs] Do I look too perfect?

01:18.495 --> 01:21.623
I don't want to outshine the bride.
[laughs]

01:21.873 --> 01:23.875
Just kidding. Yes, I do.

01:29.714 --> 01:31.966
You look like a movie star.

01:32.050 --> 01:33.384
And, Elena,

01:33.635 --> 01:37.388
you look like a very important member
of his entourage.

01:39.432 --> 01:40.475
Anyway...

01:42.018 --> 01:44.646
We still got a minute
'cause Mami is still getting ready.

01:44.896 --> 01:45.939
How is she doing?

01:46.022 --> 01:49.818
Well... it's an unusual situation, and...

01:50.151 --> 01:52.612
and she is... How do I say this?

[Penelope shouts]
Who took my pumice stone?

01:56.241 --> 01:57.158
-Flipping out.
-Mm-hmm.

01:58.493 --> 01:59.369
So when she comes out,

01:59.452 --> 02:01.204
make sure to compliment
how great she looks.

02:05.291 --> 02:08.795
Am I on a runway in Milan right now?

02:10.463 --> 02:11.464
[purrs]

02:11.548 --> 02:12.507
Okay.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.094
I get it, okay?

02:16.177 --> 02:19.556
Thank you. Thank you,
but you don't have to worry about me.

02:19.639 --> 02:21.891
Yeah,
I know that this is all a little weird,

02:21.975 --> 02:24.686
but I am going to be just fine.

02:24.769 --> 02:26.479
That's great.
Take your time getting ready.

02:26.563 --> 02:29.566
Oh, like I'm in a hurry
to cram myself into some Spanx

02:29.649 --> 02:32.485
so I can watch my ex-husband marry
a less-cute me?

02:34.612 --> 02:36.739
Alex, where is her pumice stone?

02:37.574 --> 02:40.493
And remind me to thank your father

02:40.577 --> 02:44.789
for scheduling the weirdest day of my life
right before my board exams.

02:44.873 --> 02:48.668
I should be studying all day,
but instead, I had to study all night.

02:48.751 --> 02:49.919
So you didn't get any sleep?

02:50.003 --> 02:51.546
I didn't get any sleep!

02:55.675 --> 03:00.471
Now, I get to have 150 people look at me
with pity and say to me,

03:00.555 --> 03:02.599
"Don't worry. You'll find someone."

03:02.849 --> 03:05.059
-Oh, but you will find someone.
-Shut it!

03:07.562 --> 03:10.773
There are only two kinds of people
that go to their ex-husband's wedding,

03:10.857 --> 03:12.275
psychopaths...

03:13.151 --> 03:14.277
and heroes.

03:16.362 --> 03:17.655
Guess which one I am.

03:22.368 --> 03:23.661
I'm a hero!

03:24.120 --> 03:25.246
Now, let's go!

Thank you, Papi.

05:54.645 --> 05:57.106
Obviously, you are having a moment
of self-reflection.

05:57.190 --> 06:01.069
You imagine yourself as the bride
at your ex-husband's wedding.

06:01.611 --> 06:02.612
Totally normal.

I thought he was the love of my life,
but no, he's not.

06:19.003 --> 06:21.923
Hmm. So, you're worried that
you may not find the love of your life?

06:22.006 --> 06:22.882
I don't know.

06:23.925 --> 06:25.009
Maybe.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.720
Part of the problem
is that Mami found you,

06:27.804 --> 06:29.180
and you set the bar too high.

06:29.847 --> 06:32.392
It is true. I am amazing.

on your bouquet list

that I can help you check off,
something big.

Oh, Leslie... [gasps] ...what is it?

08:03.608 --> 08:05.067
I'm taking you to Cuba.

Was that a Cuban way of saying thank you?

08:12.366 --> 08:14.410
Leslie, I am so sorry.

My body rejects even the idea
of setting foot in Cuba.

While I would love it more than anything,
it would be too painful to return.

But on your bouquet list,
you say, "Spread Berto's ashes in Cuba."

Clearly, what I meant was

go to Miami, find a pier,

wait until sundown,

08:36.224 --> 08:38.309

08:38.643 --> 08:42.605
and then spread the ashes on the ocean,

so he can find his way back to Cuba.

He's an excellent swimmer.

It's so obvious in retrospect.

out of a selfless need
to protect the people that he loved.

12:44.346 --> 12:46.515
