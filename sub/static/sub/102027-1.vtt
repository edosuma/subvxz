08:07.240 --> 08:09.110

18:25.414 --> 18:26.414
Aw, come on.

18:52.893 --> 18:55.893
(Jon softly grunts)

19:28.234 --> 19:31.410
(ominous music)

19:31.410 --> 19:34.327
(loudly screaming)

19:36.199 --> 19:39.282
(car loudly crashes)

19:45.768 --> 19:49.435
(psychedelic ominous beats)

20:47.661 --> 20:50.911
(insect softly chirps)

21:03.803 --> 21:06.470
(softly coughs)

21:11.525 --> 21:15.025
(insects softly chirping)

21:25.714 --> 21:28.631
("Every Holy Shroud" by Polvo)

21:30.712 --> 21:32.990
- Dude, so I've been having those like

21:32.990 --> 21:34.800
super fucking vivid dreams again, man,

21:34.800 --> 21:36.250
where they just feel like so real

21:36.250 --> 21:38.420
and they just, they
like creep me out, bro.

21:38.420 --> 21:42.470
And this one, man, I'm
out on this beach, right,

21:42.470 --> 21:45.890
and I can see there's like
something in the distance,

21:45.890 --> 21:48.800
like freaking out, I'm
like, what the fuck is that?

21:48.800 --> 21:50.570
So I go up to it, right,

21:50.570 --> 21:53.280
and it's like this baby whale.

21:53.280 --> 21:55.520
And it's like freaking out, and I'm like,

21:55.520 --> 21:56.810
what the fuck is this thing doing?

21:56.810 --> 21:58.220
'Cause we're not like
super close to the water,

21:58.220 --> 22:00.292
it's just the sand, I'm like,
where the fuck is the water?

22:00.292 --> 22:02.880
How'd this thing get all
the way out here, right?

22:02.880 --> 22:05.260
So this thing like
won't stop freaking out.

22:05.260 --> 22:08.510
So I had to like grab like
a piece of wood or something

22:08.510 --> 22:10.780
from the ground and just
like smash this thing

22:10.780 --> 22:13.550
to get it to like chill out,
like knock it out, right,

22:13.550 --> 22:17.040
and so I pick it up, it's
like all slippery and shit.

22:17.040 --> 22:18.700
But I throw it up on my shoulder

22:18.700 --> 22:21.240
and I start like fucking
marching this thing

22:21.240 --> 22:23.490
through this mall, right?

22:23.490 --> 22:26.800
And I come up and I see
this luggage carousel

22:26.800 --> 22:28.240
and it's got like this big green light

22:28.240 --> 22:29.970
and it's like loaded with fish.

22:29.970 --> 22:32.250
I'm like, this is, there's
something going on here.

22:32.250 --> 22:33.887
Let me figure out what
the fuck this is, right,

22:33.887 --> 22:36.630
and this carousel was
leading out to the ocean.

22:36.630 --> 22:39.065
I'm like, I know what
I gotta do now, right?

22:39.065 --> 22:40.180
I'm just gonna drop this fucking thing

22:40.180 --> 22:41.230
on the carousel and be done.

22:41.230 --> 22:43.057
So I go over there to put the thing down,

22:43.057 --> 22:44.500
it's still heavy, it's like a whale.

22:44.500 --> 22:46.323
It's a small whale, but
it's still a fucking whale,

22:46.323 --> 22:47.394
it's heavy, you know?

22:47.394 --> 22:49.950
And I drop it on this carousel

22:49.950 --> 22:52.628
and it fucking breaks the thing,

22:52.628 --> 22:55.930
and like it, and then this light on top,

22:55.930 --> 22:57.210
it like starts flashing red.

22:57.210 --> 22:59.970
I'm like, oh shit, I
just fucked something up.

22:59.970 --> 23:01.747
I'm like, I don't know if I
should run or try to fix it.

23:01.747 --> 23:05.440
I'm like, fuck this, and but
as soon as the thing fell,

23:05.440 --> 23:07.180
it fell into the water, right?

23:07.180 --> 23:08.430
But as soon as it fell into the water,

23:08.430 --> 23:10.070
this big metal piece comes down

23:10.070 --> 23:12.090
and fucking impales the whale.

23:12.090 --> 23:14.509
Like I did all this shit
trying to save this whale,

23:14.509 --> 23:16.030
and I just fucking killed it, man.

23:16.030 --> 23:18.550
It's like bleeding out all over the place.

23:18.550 --> 23:21.853
It was fucked, and yeah,
it was, it was weird, man.

23:21.853 --> 23:23.190
I don't know what the fuck that means,

23:23.190 --> 23:24.696
but it means something.

25:03.005 --> 25:05.172
- Get off him!
- Yo, Bruce!

25:06.792 --> 25:09.660
- He was walking back and forth outside,

25:09.660 --> 25:12.080
and I kept trying to calm him down.

25:12.080 --> 25:14.803
He was saying King Kong is a racist movie.

25:19.270 --> 25:21.820

the whole geography of it-

25:21.820 --> 25:23.870
- What?
- And, yeah.

25:23.870 --> 25:24.929
I mean, I kind of agree.

25:24.929 --> 25:26.479

- Come.

25:32.910 --> 25:35.435

kid has pulled some shit.

this before, man, I know.

25:49.816 --> 25:52.373
Oh, shit.

25:52.373 --> 25:53.373

25:54.719 --> 25:58.923

26:00.165 --> 26:01.765
I can only pay you 50 this time,

26:03.543 --> 26:06.263
on account of all the shit
that was broke and everything.

26:12.700 --> 26:13.850
On account of all the shit that was

26:13.850 --> 26:15.990
broke and everything.
- Yeah, cool.

26:15.990 --> 26:20.243
- All right, good job
tonight, brother, considering.

26:20.243 --> 26:21.983
You be safe out there.

26:24.170 --> 26:25.340

fucking depressing.

- [Jon] I told you before but I'm sorry.

26:44.720 --> 26:46.570
I'm sorry about everything.

26:46.570 --> 26:50.010
But I can fix this, I can make
things better for you, I can.

26:50.010 --> 26:52.797
- How do you think you make me feel, Jon?

26:52.797 --> 26:55.040
How do you think I feel with you sitting

26:55.040 --> 26:58.550
at my dinner table eating this food?

26:58.550 --> 27:02.030
I don't know, but I can fix things.

27:02.030 --> 27:04.439
I love your food.
- You don't understand.

27:04.439 --> 27:09.410
I'm hungry, I want to
eat, that is why I'm here.

27:09.410 --> 27:11.730
I need to feed myself.

27:11.730 --> 27:13.043
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

27:13.043 --> 27:16.380
- You're not sorry, if you were sorry,

27:16.380 --> 27:17.930
you would look under there

27:17.930 --> 27:20.013
and you would feed the food to that.

27:21.260 --> 27:22.490
- I don't understand.

27:22.490 --> 27:24.220
- Look under there, Jon.

27:24.220 --> 27:25.623
Look under the table, Jon.

27:28.085 --> 27:29.910
- Oh, god, what's that smell?

- Hey.

29:31.529 --> 29:32.362
- Hey.

29:34.783 --> 29:36.116
- Can I come in?

29:38.850 --> 29:41.373
- Yeah, sorry, I forgot you were coming.

(soft muffled trumpet music)

30:11.089 --> 30:16.089
- [Beth] Jon. (softly moans)

30:16.911 --> 30:20.661
(soft muffled trumpet music)

30:25.390 --> 30:27.240
- I can't stop listening to it.

30:27.240 --> 30:28.073
- Me too.

30:29.930 --> 30:31.320
- It's driving me crazy.

30:31.320 --> 30:33.100
- Me too.

30:33.100 --> 30:33.933
- What the hell?

30:33.933 --> 30:35.770
It never bothers me.

30:35.770 --> 30:36.933
Why is it bothering me?

30:38.170 --> 30:39.003
I mean,

30:40.170 --> 30:43.040
it's kinda late, do you
think I should knock?

30:43.040 --> 30:44.668
- Maybe.

30:44.668 --> 30:46.060
- You think I should?

30:46.060 --> 30:48.790
- Well, I mean, I don't know,
maybe, it is kind of late.

30:48.790 --> 30:51.300
- I mean, it makes sense
to just politely ask him

30:51.300 --> 30:53.780
to not play so loud so late.

30:53.780 --> 30:56.740
But I don't really want to be that guy.

30:56.740 --> 30:58.610
Why, why am I the dick?

30:58.610 --> 31:02.083
- No, okay, you are not
the dick, he's the dick.

31:04.230 --> 31:07.460
- Why the hell is this
bothering, this never bothers me.

31:07.460 --> 31:09.130
Why'd you do this to me?

31:09.130 --> 31:10.610
- What, I didn't do anything to you,

31:10.610 --> 31:12.400
what are you talking about?

31:12.400 --> 31:13.760
Do you want me to go?

31:13.760 --> 31:14.593
- What?

31:14.593 --> 31:15.620
- Do you want me to go?

31:15.620 --> 31:16.709
Like I'll go ask him to stop.

31:16.709 --> 31:18.110
- No, no.
- Why?

31:18.110 --> 31:19.830
It's driving you crazy, I can tell.

31:19.830 --> 31:22.190
- No, I'm too embarrassed for you.

31:22.190 --> 31:23.760
- You're embarrassed for me?

31:23.760 --> 31:25.190
- Yes, Beth, I'm asking you not to.

31:25.190 --> 31:26.740
- That doesn't make any
sense, why would you

31:26.740 --> 31:28.147
be embarrassed for me?
- It makes perfect sense.

31:28.147 --> 31:28.980
- I'm the one doing it.

31:28.980 --> 31:31.143
- Beth, why do you insist on
doing what I ask you not to do?

31:31.143 --> 31:34.610
- Because I'm trying to help
you and you don't let me

31:34.610 --> 31:36.310
make my own decisions, which is something

31:36.310 --> 31:38.025
that I'm capable of doing.
- That's not what I'm saying.

31:38.025 --> 31:38.860
- [Beth] Like, I can
actually make decisions.

31:38.860 --> 31:40.459
- All right, you can do whatever
you want, I'm just saying-

31:40.459 --> 31:42.890
- Okay, I can't do whatever I
want because you yell at me.

31:42.890 --> 31:44.410
- That's cause you're fucking asinine.

31:44.410 --> 31:45.410
- [Beth] Excuse me?

31:45.410 --> 31:46.510
- You're being asinine.

31:46.510 --> 31:48.510
- Do you even know what that means?

31:48.510 --> 31:49.860
- [Jon] Of course I know what that means.

31:49.860 --> 31:51.227
- What does it mean?

31:53.880 --> 31:55.738
- I'm pretty sure I know what it means.

31:55.738 --> 31:58.600
(softly knocking at door)

31:58.600 --> 32:00.515
- What the hell was that?

32:00.515 --> 32:02.690
- I think we're being too loud.

32:02.690 --> 32:04.500
- [Beth] We are not that loud.

32:04.500 --> 32:06.200
- Beth, we were screaming.

32:06.200 --> 32:07.570
- What about the trumpet player?

32:07.570 --> 32:08.620
- [Jon] He's a good kid.

32:08.620 --> 32:09.543
- He's loud.

32:12.277 --> 32:13.527
- Nevertheless.

32:14.550 --> 32:15.739
- So you're not gonna go get the door,

32:15.739 --> 32:17.780
you're just gonna leave him there?

32:17.780 --> 32:19.120
- No, I know what they want.

32:19.120 --> 32:21.763
They know I know what they
want, just be quiet now.

32:24.180 --> 32:27.033
- Just don't understand you sometimes.

32:30.227 --> 32:32.627
What do you want me to
do, do you want me to go?

32:35.440 --> 32:37.810
Where the fuck is my shirt, Jon?

32:37.810 --> 32:39.820
- I don't know where your shirt is, Beth.

32:39.820 --> 32:41.490
- [Beth] Okay, well, you took it off.

32:41.490 --> 32:42.440
- Yeah, I remember that.
(soft muffled trumpet music)

32:42.440 --> 32:44.290
- Jesus, what the fuck is under here?

32:45.158 --> 32:46.909
Okay, like what did you do, did you just

32:46.909 --> 32:48.460
toss it up in the air?
- Did you look under the bed?

32:48.460 --> 32:50.210
- Yes, I just looked
under the bed, are you not

32:50.210 --> 32:51.080
even paying attention?
- Was it under there?

32:51.080 --> 32:52.810
- No, it wasn't under the bed.

32:52.810 --> 32:54.690
Would I be talking to you
if it was under the bed?

32:54.690 --> 32:56.090
- No you can't, that's my favorite jacket,

32:56.090 --> 32:56.923
you can't take that.
- Okay, I don't care.

32:56.923 --> 32:58.540
I'm taking it, and it doesn't-
- No, that's,

32:58.540 --> 32:59.630
hey, that's backwards.

32:59.630 --> 33:01.280
- Okay, whatever I don't
care, maybe I wanna

33:01.280 --> 33:02.113
wear it backwards.
- You're gonna stretch it out.

33:02.113 --> 33:04.940
You can't stretch it out, that
was my grandfather's jacket.

33:04.940 --> 33:06.283
- I don't care!

33:08.710 --> 33:10.040
I think we should stop seeing each other

33:10.040 --> 33:12.110
because this isn't working.

33:12.110 --> 33:12.943
- What?

33:12.943 --> 33:14.173
Are you breaking up with me?

33:15.930 --> 33:17.445
- We are not a couple.

33:17.445 --> 33:18.940
- What about the thing tomorrow?

33:18.940 --> 33:20.210
- The thing, what?

33:20.210 --> 33:21.870
- The mermaid thing, you invited me.

33:21.870 --> 33:22.703
- The mermaid?

33:22.703 --> 33:24.130
I'm not going to a mermaid thing tomorrow.

33:24.130 --> 33:25.310
- Well, I'm going to the
mermaid thing tomorrow.

33:25.310 --> 33:26.579
- Okay, you go to the mermaid thing

33:26.579 --> 33:27.412
tomorrow.
- I am!

33:27.412 --> 33:28.578
- Okay, good, have fun!

33:28.578 --> 33:29.540
- I will.

33:29.540 --> 33:31.890
- Okay, good, why the fuck do
you keep telling me about it?

33:31.890 --> 33:32.773
- So what now then?

33:32.773 --> 33:35.427
- We have a show on Saturday, shithead.

33:37.218 --> 33:39.551
- Fuck, I forgot about that.

35:27.910 --> 35:31.243
(kids softly screaming)

36:04.460 --> 36:05.910
- Hi there.

36:05.910 --> 36:07.910
How much, how much for the mermaid show?

36:09.060 --> 36:10.100
- Nine bucks.

36:10.100 --> 36:12.503
- Nine, nine bucks.

36:13.680 --> 36:14.883
You got change for 20?

36:40.690 --> 36:42.090
- What happened to your eye?

36:51.799 --> 36:53.853
- You know you can't go in there, right?

36:57.156 --> 36:58.450
- What do you mean?

36:58.450 --> 37:00.420
- Show doesn't start till eight tonight.

37:00.420 --> 37:02.113
You bought a ticket for the show.

37:03.377 --> 37:06.150
- But I thought there was stuff
going on all night in there.

37:06.150 --> 37:08.610
- Yeah, that's the regular exhibit.

37:08.610 --> 37:10.560
That regular exhibit goes on all night.

37:12.080 --> 37:13.440
- Okay.

37:13.440 --> 37:15.927
- You wanna buy a ticket
to the regular exhibit?

37:15.927 --> 37:18.300
- I guess, if I, if I buy the ticket

37:18.300 --> 37:20.210
for the regular exhibit, can I go in now?

37:20.210 --> 37:23.669
- Yeah, obviously, you buy
the ticket, you can go in.

37:23.669 --> 37:25.560
- All right, well, I was just making sure

37:25.560 --> 37:27.550
because I thought that's
what the first ticket did.

37:27.550 --> 37:29.970
- First ticket was the show ticket.

37:29.970 --> 37:32.263
The normal thing goes on all night.

37:33.208 --> 37:36.237
- All right, all right, I'll
just get the normal ticket,

37:36.237 --> 37:37.470
then, I didn't know.
- All right,

37:37.470 --> 37:38.870
no need to get aggressive.

37:38.870 --> 37:40.433
I'm just trying to explain.
- Okay, all right, okay, okay.

37:40.433 --> 37:42.130
Can I just do an exchange

37:42.130 --> 37:44.660
for the show ticket for the normal ticket?

37:44.660 --> 37:46.929
- You can, I can't do exchanges.

37:46.929 --> 37:49.150
You gotta go over to the customer service.

37:49.150 --> 37:50.611
If you want to do an exchange.
- I'm not going to the,

37:50.611 --> 37:52.860
no, I'll just buy the normal ticket,

37:52.860 --> 37:54.410
how much is it, how much is it?

37:55.360 --> 37:56.610
- Five bucks.

37:56.610 --> 37:57.443
- Five,

38:00.660 --> 38:01.653
change for a 10?

38:04.260 --> 38:06.210
- Boy, you are really cleaning me out

38:06.210 --> 38:08.057
all my change over here.

41:32.906 --> 41:34.573
- Hey.
- What are you watching?

41:37.810 --> 41:39.833
- Nothing, how are you?

41:41.610 --> 41:42.957
- I'm glad you called.

41:51.750 --> 41:53.530
- Okay, so I couldn't figure anything out

41:53.530 --> 41:56.570
about this Anna girl, but I know there's

41:56.570 --> 41:58.300
something weird going on at that carnival.

41:58.300 --> 42:01.380
It's owned by this dude,
Salvador Montalvano.

42:01.380 --> 42:05.400
- Salvador, you mean Salvatore, right?

42:05.400 --> 42:06.850
- Salvador.

42:06.850 --> 42:09.203
- Salvatore, it's Italian.

42:10.250 --> 42:12.350
- Great, so it's owned
by this Italian dude

42:12.350 --> 42:15.193
who I saw at the mermaid
show and he was all like,

42:17.930 --> 42:19.180
I don't know, I don't know.

42:19.180 --> 42:22.000
- Okay, so what about this girl?

42:22.000 --> 42:25.147
- Well, I, I think she's not safe.

42:25.147 --> 42:26.040
- [Beth] Jon.

42:26.040 --> 42:28.550
- No, I'm serious, and
I, this dude Salvador-

42:28.550 --> 42:29.690
- Salvatore.

42:29.690 --> 42:31.560
- I know he has something to do with it.

42:31.560 --> 42:34.140
Why would Salvatore have
anything to do with it?

42:34.140 --> 42:36.830
- Because he's scary, angry and evil.

42:36.830 --> 42:39.630
- I don't think you should
be drinking coffee right now.

42:41.120 --> 42:42.850
- It doesn't affect me.

42:42.850 --> 42:44.793
- Okay, so who's Anna?

42:45.660 --> 42:47.150
- [Jon] I don't know.

42:47.150 --> 42:48.630
- But didn't you talk to her?

42:48.630 --> 42:53.230
- Yeah, but she was,
she's very aloof. Aloof?

42:53.230 --> 42:55.000
- And she looks like Mona?

42:55.000 --> 42:58.030
- Like exactly like Mona,
like she have a twin sister?

42:58.030 --> 42:59.690
- [Beth] Shouldn't you know that?

42:59.690 --> 43:01.000
- You knew her longer.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.150
- No, she didn't have
a twin sister, but...

43:06.090 --> 43:07.090
- So what now, then?

43:28.940 --> 43:30.720
It's this weird thing I know

43:30.720 --> 43:34.330
but I feel like we have some
sort of connection or something

43:34.330 --> 43:37.485
and you look exactly like
my dead ex-girlfriend.

43:37.485 --> 43:39.563
- That's how you're gonna say it?

43:40.970 --> 43:42.670
- Well, what am I supposed to say?

43:45.019 --> 43:47.310
- You should say that...

43:49.187 --> 43:52.750
"You, you look like
someone I used to know."

43:52.750 --> 43:54.617
No, you should say, "You remind me

43:54.617 --> 43:56.450
"of someone I used to
know," that sounds better.

43:56.450 --> 43:58.280

43:58.280 --> 44:01.680
I feel like we have some sort

44:05.850 --> 44:07.860

44:07.860 --> 44:10.080
Maybe I should just
shouldn't say anything.

44:10.080 --> 44:11.880
- You gotta be ready for that.

44:11.880 --> 44:13.720
It sounds like that's
what you're gonna say.

44:13.720 --> 44:15.500
You can see it in your face,

44:15.500 --> 44:17.240
like your face totally says that.

44:17.240 --> 44:18.300
- Dude, she...

44:20.740 --> 44:23.120
Well, okay, so what am
I supposed to do then?

44:23.120 --> 44:23.960
- Okay.

44:23.960 --> 44:26.370
- If I can't say that,
yeah, she just won't care.

44:26.370 --> 44:27.203
I shouldn't say anything.

44:27.203 --> 44:29.110
- About what, what are you talking about?

44:29.110 --> 44:30.340
- About Mona.

44:30.340 --> 44:31.173
- Okay.

44:31.173 --> 44:34.163
- About Mona, the mermaid
looks exactly like Mona.

44:35.945 --> 44:36.778
- Okay.

44:43.830 --> 44:46.955
Okay, I have an idea, I
know what I'm gonna do.

44:46.955 --> 44:48.493
I'm gonna come down here,

44:48.493 --> 44:52.223
and I'm gonna help you and
we're gonna do it, okay.

44:54.430 --> 44:58.573
So I want you to look me in
the face and I want you to,

45:00.624 --> 45:03.173
I want you to say what you
would say to her to me.

45:05.038 --> 45:05.871
- Okay.

45:08.490 --> 45:13.490
I know we just met, but I feel
like we have this connection

45:13.790 --> 45:16.230
and you look exactly like my ex-girlfriend

45:16.230 --> 45:17.697
who died not that long ago.

45:19.122 --> 45:22.003
No, man, (Beth loudly laughs)
you're so out of control.

45:27.323 --> 45:31.163
- I'm, whoa, whoa, what is your damage?

45:32.340 --> 45:33.173
- What the hell?

45:33.173 --> 45:34.400
- What do you mean, "What the hell?"

45:34.400 --> 45:35.653
Why would you do that?

45:37.090 --> 45:39.140
- All right, I'll see you later, I guess.

45:40.880 --> 45:41.713
- Jon,

45:42.911 --> 45:45.040
I think you should spy on her.

45:45.040 --> 45:46.220
- Spy on her?

45:46.220 --> 45:47.740
That's what you're gonna leave me with.

45:47.740 --> 45:49.980
- Yeah, you know where she
works, go back tomorrow,

45:49.980 --> 45:51.008
wait until she leaves-
- No, no, no,

45:51.008 --> 45:52.460
I'm not doing that.
- And see what you can see.

45:52.460 --> 45:53.800
- See what I can see?

45:53.800 --> 45:54.770
Beth, I'm not doing that.

45:54.770 --> 45:56.070
- Don't be an ash mat.

45:56.070 --> 45:57.150
- Excuse me?

45:57.150 --> 45:59.723
- Yeah, don't you want to
know who she is, man up.

46:00.612 --> 46:02.860
- I do want to know who she is

46:02.860 --> 46:05.710
but I'm not, I'm not spying on her.

46:05.710 --> 46:06.860
I'm better than that.

46:09.337 --> 46:10.756
- Whatever.

46:10.756 --> 46:11.589
- Ash mat?

46:16.233 --> 46:19.449
(crowd softly cheering)

46:19.449 --> 46:22.532
(smooth funk music)

47:15.235 --> 47:19.241
Shit, shit, shit, get your
head in the game, come on.

47:19.241 --> 47:20.500
- Excuse me.

47:20.500 --> 47:23.163
- Yeah, um, nice mask.

47:24.204 --> 47:27.853
I was just admiring your groovy
ride here, beach cruiser.

47:31.100 --> 47:33.950
So what, is it dangerous
riding this thing out here?

47:33.950 --> 47:37.283
Lots of car accidents, have you
ever been in a car accident?

47:39.009 --> 47:39.959

47:42.340 --> 47:43.173
- I'm Bruce.

47:47.100 --> 47:49.760
Okay, this...

47:49.760 --> 47:50.883
Here's what it is.

47:51.720 --> 47:54.620
I think that we have some sort
of connection or something

47:54.620 --> 47:57.923
and you look like someone I used to know.

47:59.285 --> 48:02.047
- I'm wearing a mask.

48:02.047 --> 48:04.470
- I'm wearing a mask.

48:04.470 --> 48:06.540
You're wearing a mask.

48:06.540 --> 48:09.400
Aren't we all wearing masks?

48:09.400 --> 48:12.000
Some are silk-
- Yeah, okay.

48:12.000 --> 48:15.213
- Some are silk, some are
satin, some are steel.

48:16.110 --> 48:18.500
Some are leather, some are feathers.

48:18.500 --> 48:20.143

49:41.973 --> 49:42.897

- What the hell?

49:44.960 --> 49:46.580
You following me?

49:46.580 --> 49:47.413
- What the hell?

49:47.413 --> 49:48.332
- [Anna] What?

49:48.332 --> 49:49.183
- What are you doing?

49:49.183 --> 49:50.650
- What is your problem?

49:50.650 --> 49:52.110
- [Jon] I know what you're doing.

49:52.110 --> 49:52.943
- What?

49:52.943 --> 49:53.830
- You know what I'm talking about,

49:53.830 --> 49:55.300
the mask, Anna, why the mask?

49:55.300 --> 49:57.650
- Oh, yeah, I thought you
knew what I was doing.

49:57.650 --> 49:58.880
- I know enough.

49:58.880 --> 50:00.410
- Oh God.

50:00.410 --> 50:01.810
What do you think I'm doing?

50:03.710 --> 50:04.883
- Evil shit.

50:06.450 --> 50:07.950
- I'm leaving.

50:07.950 --> 50:10.303
Follow me, and I will do evil shit to you.

50:14.530 --> 50:15.530
- Your name is Mona.

50:18.436 --> 50:19.269
- What?

50:21.710 --> 50:22.653
- You're Mona.

50:24.080 --> 50:26.680
I know it's you, all right,
when the fuck is this-

50:26.680 --> 50:28.170
- What?
- Gonna stop?

50:28.170 --> 50:29.400
- What are you talking about?

50:29.400 --> 50:31.850
- You know what I'm talking about, and-

50:31.850 --> 50:32.683
- Shit.

50:37.220 --> 50:39.200

- Let go.

50:39.200 --> 50:40.680
- When is this gonna stop,
why are you doing this to me?

50:40.680 --> 50:42.263
- Look, my name is Anna.

50:43.640 --> 50:45.400
And you don't want to be involved in this.

50:45.400 --> 50:47.180
- No, your name is Mona.

50:47.180 --> 50:48.383
You're Mona-
- Let go.

50:49.870 --> 50:52.040
- I'm Jon, who the fuck is that?

50:52.040 --> 50:53.240
- Let go, or I'll-
- You know I saw

50:53.240 --> 50:55.330
that house in my dream, did
you know that I saw that?

50:55.330 --> 50:56.840
- I'm not responsible for your dreams.

50:56.840 --> 50:57.823
- Neither am I.

50:58.730 --> 51:00.480
Hey, who-
- Let go.

51:00.480 --> 51:01.313
- Who is that?

51:01.313 --> 51:03.819
- Let go, or I'll scream.

51:03.819 --> 51:06.736
(soft opera music)

51:33.830 --> 51:37.598

52:28.407 --> 52:29.680
- So I've been like, having like

52:30.610 --> 52:32.610
those crazy fucked-up dreams again,

52:32.610 --> 52:35.530
like super like real and vivid, man.

52:35.530 --> 52:37.450
Ever since I haven't been
like partying so much, and-

52:37.450 --> 52:39.890
- Did you find out anything about Anna?

52:39.890 --> 52:41.480
- Nope, nothing.

52:41.480 --> 52:42.407
- Nothing?

52:42.407 --> 52:43.870
- Seems totally normal.

52:43.870 --> 52:45.900
- [Bruce] We're all out
camping at like this lake-

52:45.900 --> 52:46.961
- Well, you know what I was thinking

52:46.961 --> 52:48.557
maybe this time what you can do

52:48.557 --> 52:49.660
is you can go back-
- Beth, drop it.

52:49.660 --> 52:51.110
- No, really, listen, this is a good idea,

52:51.110 --> 52:52.510
you can go back and look her

52:52.510 --> 52:53.858
directly into the eyes and-
- Beth, I'm serious.

52:53.858 --> 52:56.025
Please stop it, please.

52:56.025 --> 52:58.176
- Okay, all right.

52:58.176 --> 52:59.137
I'll let it go.

52:59.137 --> 53:00.573
- And it comes up to
me and I remember this,

53:00.573 --> 53:02.293
this story of like when I was a little kid

53:02.293 --> 53:04.290
about this like pond-
- I never apologized

53:04.290 --> 53:05.789
about the other night.

53:05.789 --> 53:06.840
- The other night?

53:06.840 --> 53:08.110
- Yeah, I just had a lot,

53:08.110 --> 53:10.125
like on my mind altogether.

53:10.125 --> 53:12.540
I spaced out, I just
completely spaced out.

53:12.540 --> 53:14.201
There was so much going on.
- I thought it was my fault.

53:14.201 --> 53:15.827
Don't worry about it.

53:15.827 --> 53:17.023
- What?

53:17.023 --> 53:18.323
- I mean, with everything going on with

53:18.323 --> 53:21.453
Mona and this mermaid girl like,

53:21.453 --> 53:22.995
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

53:22.995 --> 53:24.713
- What does that have to do with anything?

53:24.713 --> 53:26.922
- I mean, even though you
were giving me mixed signals,

53:26.922 --> 53:29.713
it was kind of a dick move
to make a move on you.

53:30.950 --> 53:32.680
- I'm talking about the night we played

53:32.680 --> 53:34.447
and I skipped your solo.

53:35.981 --> 53:37.569
- I don't remember that.
- I'm not talking about

53:37.569 --> 53:39.188
the night that I came over.

53:39.188 --> 53:40.279
And I'm not sorry about that either

53:40.279 --> 53:42.535
because you were being a dick.

53:42.535 --> 53:45.453
- Beth, you don't always have
to remind me of my failures.

53:45.453 --> 53:46.433
- Okay, well.
- I remember them.

53:46.433 --> 53:49.440
- I will remind you of your
failures when they involve me.

53:49.440 --> 53:51.400
And, well actually, besides,

53:51.400 --> 53:52.784
you already said that
you were being a dick

53:52.784 --> 53:54.832
and you admitted to it.
- Why are you this way?

53:54.832 --> 53:56.131
- Why am I this way?

53:56.131 --> 53:57.797
I'm just the way that God made me.

53:57.797 --> 53:59.080
- Camping and drinking and-
- Oh, great, yeah, well,

53:59.080 --> 54:01.103
have you ever thought maybe,
(crosstalk drowns out Bruce)

54:01.103 --> 54:03.026
maybe think about this, there's something

54:03.026 --> 54:05.271
that you could have done
differently in a situation.

54:05.271 --> 54:06.850
- What situation?

54:06.850 --> 54:08.060
- I wasn't being a dick, really.

54:08.060 --> 54:09.390
- Yes, you were, you were being a dick.

54:09.390 --> 54:11.218
- I wasn't being a dick.
- And why would you say that?

54:11.218 --> 54:12.980
You already admitted and apologized

54:12.980 --> 54:14.021
to being a dick.
- I thought you were

54:14.021 --> 54:14.887
apologizing for being a dick.
- You thought I

54:14.887 --> 54:16.012
was being a dick?
- And I was trying

54:16.012 --> 54:17.100
to self-defrecate on your behalf.

54:17.100 --> 54:18.090
- What, self-defecate?

54:18.090 --> 54:19.030
- I was trying to be nice.

54:19.030 --> 54:19.863
- You're not nice.

54:19.863 --> 54:20.696
- Yes, I am.

54:20.696 --> 54:21.529
- No, you're not.

54:21.529 --> 54:22.420
- Yes, I am.

54:22.420 --> 54:24.630
- No, you're not, don't
self-defecate on my behalf.

54:24.630 --> 54:25.980
- I'm trying to be nice, Beth.

54:25.980 --> 54:27.228
- You're not nice, Lee?

54:27.228 --> 54:29.600
Lee, Lee is Jon nice?
- Leave Lee out of this.

54:29.600 --> 54:30.605
- Jon's a nice, dude.
- No, right?

54:30.605 --> 54:31.750
- Thank you, Lee.
- No, what?

54:31.750 --> 54:33.170
Why would you say that?
- Lee knows.

54:33.170 --> 54:34.860
- No, okay, you are not a nice guy.

54:34.860 --> 54:36.154
- Ask-
- Don't bring Danny into this.

54:36.154 --> 54:37.336
- Ask Danny.
- Don't even bring Danny

54:37.336 --> 54:38.432
into this.
- Danny, am I a nice guy?

54:38.432 --> 54:39.555
- [Beth] Danny don't answer that,

54:39.555 --> 54:41.286
you don't have to answer that.
- You let your 14-year-old

54:41.286 --> 54:42.780
brother jump in?
- See, you're not a nice guy.

54:42.780 --> 54:44.030
- Do I take a lower pay

54:44.030 --> 54:45.526
than everyone because
I'm a fucking asshole?

54:45.526 --> 54:46.973
- Whoa, lift the glass!

54:46.973 --> 54:48.650
What the fuck are you doing?

54:48.650 --> 54:50.338
- It all spilled out-
- Calm down.

54:50.338 --> 54:51.630
- Seriously, man, god.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

54:51.630 --> 54:52.595
it was an accident.
- Why would you do that?

54:52.595 --> 54:54.523
- Can somebody bring some paper towels?

54:54.523 --> 54:56.416
- Were you listening to my fucking story?

54:56.416 --> 54:57.533
- I'm sorry, man.
- Bruce, nobody cares

54:57.533 --> 54:59.370
about your dream, no one cares

54:59.370 --> 55:00.460
about your dream.
- Don't be such a bitch, Beth.

55:00.460 --> 55:02.028
- Don't call me a bitch.

55:02.028 --> 55:03.520
- Kind of a bitch, Beth.

55:03.520 --> 55:05.490
- No matter what you do and where you go,

55:05.490 --> 55:07.760
I will always be there
to watch you fuck it up.

55:07.760 --> 55:09.647
- Paper towels!
- Damn, geez.

55:09.647 --> 55:12.589
Jesus Christ lady. Oh my god!

55:12.589 --> 55:14.027
- Jon, what the fuck?

55:15.663 --> 55:17.820
- [Danny] How do you even?

55:17.820 --> 55:20.166
I don't even get that.

55:20.166 --> 55:22.326
I don't, I don't know.

55:22.326 --> 55:25.159
(soft jazz on TV)

55:30.931 --> 55:35.931
I mean, what the, I don't even
understand (softly mumbles)

55:40.276 --> 55:41.109
Goddamn.

55:42.330 --> 55:43.163
- I quit.

55:45.660 --> 55:46.537
- What are you saying to me?

55:46.537 --> 55:48.550
- I quit, I'm not coming back.

55:48.550 --> 55:51.350
- This shit is crazy, man, look,

55:51.350 --> 55:53.080
look at this dude's,
what do you call those?

55:53.080 --> 55:54.830
His dorsie, dorsa?

55:54.830 --> 55:55.723
- Your lats?

55:55.723 --> 55:58.840
- Lat, look, your lat, dude,
look at this dude's lat.

55:58.840 --> 56:02.600
He's got lats the size of
West Texas, motha fuck-

56:02.600 --> 56:04.750
- I'm not coming back,
can I grab my check?

56:05.813 --> 56:08.041
- Man, you gotta get over that girl.

56:08.041 --> 56:09.291
That's what you gotta do.

56:11.562 --> 56:15.533
Look, man, you do whatever
you gotta do, but,

56:18.467 --> 56:19.343
there's the full 200.

56:19.343 --> 56:21.390
That should keep you going in the interim.

56:21.390 --> 56:22.330
- The interim?

56:22.330 --> 56:24.446
- Yeah, man, 'cause I care about you,

56:24.446 --> 56:26.080
physically-
- We said 250.

56:26.080 --> 56:27.083
- Phys... We said 250?

56:28.920 --> 56:31.223
Physiologically. I can't do 250.

56:32.800 --> 56:35.378
But that should keep you
going in the interim.

56:35.378 --> 56:37.463
- All right, all right,
I'll see you tomorrow.

56:38.678 --> 56:41.330
- Look, this is some mutant shit.

56:41.330 --> 56:43.560
I can see the veins in your ass.

56:43.560 --> 56:45.053
You shoot up in your ass.

56:46.731 --> 56:49.931
(whimsical carnival music)
(kids softly screaming)

56:49.931 --> 56:52.920
- [Man] Here you go, $5.

56:52.920 --> 56:54.173
All right, thank you.

56:57.400 --> 56:58.270
- Hi, there-

56:58.270 --> 57:00.220
- $5 please.

57:00.220 --> 57:02.070
- I actually just wanted
to talk to the manager

57:02.070 --> 57:03.907
to get some information
on the mermaid show.

57:03.907 --> 57:06.363
- He's inside the exhibit,
that's his office.

57:08.140 --> 57:09.854
- Can I go talk to him now?

57:09.854 --> 57:11.480
I don't know, you can try.

57:11.480 --> 57:12.880
- Okay, thank you.

57:12.880 --> 57:13.713
- Wait!

57:14.650 --> 57:15.483
It's $5.

57:18.360 --> 57:20.859
- But I'm not going to the
show, I just, I told you,

57:20.859 --> 57:22.510
I just want to talk to the manager.

57:22.510 --> 57:24.750
- The manager is in his office.

57:24.750 --> 57:27.910
His office is in the exhibit, it's $5.

57:27.910 --> 57:29.700
- I was, can he come out here then?

57:29.700 --> 57:31.735
Because I was here
yesterday, I already paid.

57:31.735 --> 57:33.227
I don't want to go see
the show, I just want

57:33.227 --> 57:34.060
to talk to the guy.
- Today's wristband color

57:34.060 --> 57:36.640
is orange, you can't get
in with a green wristband.

57:36.640 --> 57:40.150
It's $5 for today's wristband
color, which is orange.

57:40.150 --> 57:41.240
- What's this one do?

57:41.240 --> 57:43.280
- Today's wristband color is orange.

57:43.280 --> 57:45.896
You can't get in with a
white wristband, it's $5

57:45.896 --> 57:47.870
for today's wristband color-
- Okay, okay.

57:47.870 --> 57:49.384
- Which is orange.

57:49.384 --> 57:52.162
- Okay, how 'bout this, how
'bout you go get the manager-

57:52.162 --> 57:54.470
- Come on, man, it's just five bucks.

57:54.470 --> 57:56.080
- I'm not going into the show.

57:56.080 --> 57:57.971
I just wanna talk to the
manager, she's not letting-

57:57.971 --> 58:00.190
- It doesn't matter, man,
it's just five bucks.

58:00.190 --> 58:02.020
- Just mind your own
business for a second, man.

58:02.020 --> 58:04.240
- Hey, this is my business, man.

58:04.240 --> 58:07.823
- Okay, can you help me
out with this at all, man?

58:10.164 --> 58:11.140
What is this?

58:11.140 --> 58:12.270
What are your names?

58:12.270 --> 58:13.710
- My name is tickets are $5.

58:13.710 --> 58:16.512
- Okay, listen, you little
ticket Nazi, I just-

58:16.512 --> 58:18.530
- It doesn't matter, man,
it's just five bucks.

58:18.530 --> 58:20.531
- Hey, you, shut your mouth!

58:20.531 --> 58:21.683
- [Man In Floral Shirt] What?

58:21.683 --> 58:22.516
- What?

58:22.516 --> 58:24.396
- [Man In Floral Shirt] What?

58:24.396 --> 58:27.177
- Look, I'm sorry, man, just relax, it's,

58:27.177 --> 58:28.733
I'm having a rough day.
- Shut my mouth?

58:29.960 --> 58:30.810
Shut my mouth?

58:30.810 --> 58:32.020
- I'm sorry, man, I didn't mean that.

58:32.020 --> 58:33.550
- I'll fucking touch you, man!

58:33.550 --> 58:34.383
- What?

58:37.480 --> 58:38.870
- Dude, fucking hell.

58:38.870 --> 58:39.703
- Next.

58:39.703 --> 58:42.360
- [Man In Floral Shirt]
But he was the aggressor.

58:42.360 --> 58:43.747
- [Officer] It's not the way I see it.

58:43.747 --> 58:44.640
- [Man In Floral Shirt]
That's some bullshit, man.

58:44.640 --> 58:46.190
I was trying to mind my business,

58:46.190 --> 58:47.930
you know, just trying to keep it cool.

58:47.930 --> 58:49.540
- Look, we asked several people,

58:49.540 --> 58:52.130
they said he was ordering
tickets, arguing with concessions

58:52.130 --> 58:54.090
which is a whole separate incident.

58:54.090 --> 58:56.840
He turned to you, some
obscenities were exchanged.

58:56.840 --> 58:58.703
No particulars were exchanged.

58:59.540 --> 59:01.150
You assaulted him in the face.

59:01.150 --> 59:02.480
That's what we understand.

59:02.480 --> 59:04.520
Several people saw this.

59:04.520 --> 59:06.786
Several witnesses said-
- Just a minute.

59:06.786 --> 59:08.970
- That you assaulted him in the face.

59:08.970 --> 59:09.803
- Wait.

59:11.530 --> 59:12.480
You might be right.

59:13.660 --> 59:16.363
But, I gotta say something.

59:23.090 --> 59:24.707
He was the aggressor.

59:24.707 --> 59:28.960
