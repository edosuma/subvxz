This it?

01:11.112 --> 01:12.864
No, that's a 3/4 whositz.

01:12.947 --> 01:14.949

[Goofy humming]

01:21.915 --> 01:24.417
Ah-hyuck. Now she'll close like a charm.

01:24.542 --> 01:26.461
You sure about this, Dad?

01:26.544 --> 01:28.505
Yup. Just give her a click.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.677
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

01:33.760 --> 01:36.054
Dad. You all right?

01:36.137 --> 01:38.098
Click it again.

01:48.191 --> 01:49.359
Hey, what's happenin'?

01:49.442 --> 01:50.443
Great timing.

01:50.527 --> 01:52.320
Dad, Peej and I are going
skateboarding, OK?

01:52.404 --> 01:54.322
OK. Have fun.

01:54.406 --> 01:56.157
Uh, good luck, Mr G.

02:03.748 --> 02:05.333
You saved me, P.J.

02:05.417 --> 02:06.751
When it comes to mechanical stuff,

02:06.835 --> 02:08.712
my dad's a real klutzoid.

02:08.795 --> 02:09.921
Whoa!

02:14.926 --> 02:16.386
Yeah, but at least he lets you help.

02:16.469 --> 02:19.055
I mean, when my dad's working,
steer clear, man.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.975
Speaking of which,
let's go bum a soda from him.

02:22.058 --> 02:26.271
No way. Right now he's definitely working.

02:26.354 --> 02:27.439
How can you tell?

02:27.939 --> 02:29.858
[P.J.]
He's wearing his "sales" glasses.

02:30.025 --> 02:32.777
And how about that mirror on the visor?

02:32.861 --> 02:35.030
Pretty convenient, huh?

02:36.031 --> 02:39.451
Mobile, too. [laughs]

02:39.534 --> 02:42.203
Aw, he's too busy being
a phony-baloney. Come on.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.789
Now, as I was saying, this baby
gets 25 blocks per gallon,

02:44.873 --> 02:47.250
has AM-AM radio, and is
biodegradable in salt water.

02:47.334 --> 02:51.046
So how's about a nice soft drink
while you sign the papers?

02:51.129 --> 02:53.214
Well, I... I don't know.

02:53.298 --> 02:55.342
Maybe I should go home and think about it.

02:55.508 --> 02:58.345
Did I mention the original factory air

02:58.428 --> 03:00.555
is still in the tires?

03:00.638 --> 03:02.390
Wow. A '57 Woody!

03:02.474 --> 03:04.392
This only has to be the most
classic car of all time.

03:04.476 --> 03:05.852
A west coast daydream.

03:05.935 --> 03:08.021
Imagine the surfboards
that rode in here.

03:08.104 --> 03:10.023
You mean this car is famous?

03:10.106 --> 03:13.485
Get outta town! It's got everything.
History. Fun. Babes.

03:13.568 --> 03:16.029
I'd give my right kneecap
for this machine.

03:16.112 --> 03:17.947
I'll take it.

03:18.031 --> 03:21.951
Uh, sure, OK. Let me get the paperwork.

03:23.370 --> 03:27.123
Here. Have a cold one, pal.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.417
Why don't you help me out like that, P.J.?

03:33.672 --> 03:36.800
Oh, and, Maxie, stop by tonight.

03:36.883 --> 03:41.304
I want your opinion
on my new Pete-mobile.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.264
All right, Max!

03:43.348 --> 03:44.891
He's startin' to like you, man.

03:44.974 --> 03:46.267
Pete-mobile?

03:46.351 --> 03:48.269
A top-secret recreational vehicle

03:48.353 --> 03:49.354
he's working on.

03:49.437 --> 03:51.564
Even I haven't seen it yet.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.653
[Pete] I'm entering her in
the big RV show in Las Vegas.

03:56.736 --> 04:00.657
"Most luxurious" category.
Gonna make a bundle.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.367
[Max] Whoa, awesome.

04:02.450 --> 04:04.077
You know, I bet you'd win for sure

04:04.160 --> 04:06.037
if you added a satellite dish.

04:06.121 --> 04:09.040
Satellite dish. Great idea.

04:09.124 --> 04:11.668
Always thinkin', kid. [laughs]

04:11.751 --> 04:14.838
Why, you remind me of... of me.

04:16.214 --> 04:18.717
Wish P.J. had your pizzazz.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.018
Wanna see me spell
Mississippi with only one "i"?

04:28.435 --> 04:29.310
No.

04:29.394 --> 04:32.731
M-i-s-s-i-s-s-i-p-p-i. Get it?

04:32.814 --> 04:34.733
[giggles] Bye.

04:34.816 --> 04:37.277
Wow, P.J., that RV is
totally rad and bad.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.029
Your dad's a genius.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.739
Thought you said he was a phony-baloney.

04:40.822 --> 04:44.367
No way. He loves my ideas.
Here, hold this.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.202
We're gonna get that van fully tweaked,

04:46.286 --> 04:49.289
then take it to a big RV show
and win major bucks.

04:49.372 --> 04:50.415
Awesome.

04:50.498 --> 04:53.126
Max. What about a tape deck?
Here, hold this.

04:53.209 --> 04:56.296
Not bad, sir, but a whole
sound system would be better.

04:58.256 --> 05:00.216
Bingo. You don't mind, do ya, son?

05:00.300 --> 05:01.801
But, Dad...

05:01.885 --> 05:03.345
Whoa. Major brain flash!

05:03.428 --> 05:05.513
Remember that TV show
about the talking car

05:05.597 --> 05:06.890
with the computer on board?

05:06.973 --> 05:08.892
-With the bad actor?
-Uh-huh.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.144
I like your style.

05:13.646 --> 05:15.648
-Thanks, Peej.
-Yeah, but...

05:20.403 --> 05:23.448
[Pete] Bring your chair down, too, OK?

05:23.531 --> 05:26.076
[mocking]
Bring your chair down, too, OK?

05:30.455 --> 05:31.664
[alarm blaring]

05:34.959 --> 05:37.087
-Oh, hi, Peej.
-We gotta talk.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.714
Be right back, sir. What's up?

05:39.798 --> 05:42.842
OK, in the past two days,
you and my dad have made off

05:42.926 --> 05:44.302
with everything in my house,

05:44.386 --> 05:46.930
from the big screen TV to Pistol's toys.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.765
We're tweaking the Pete-mobile.

05:48.848 --> 05:51.017
Well, how come I'm not helping?

05:51.101 --> 05:54.104
Peej, on a scale of 1 to 10,

05:54.187 --> 05:56.606
how much does your dad usually like me?

05:56.690 --> 05:58.733
Um, less than zero.

05:58.817 --> 06:01.319
Right. Well, if he starts liking me,

06:01.403 --> 06:04.364
you and I can spend
a lot more time together.

06:04.447 --> 06:07.117
Oh, yeah, I see. OK.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.787
Great, now be a pal and get
this item from my dad. Thanks.

06:15.583 --> 06:17.043
Uh, Mr G?

06:17.127 --> 06:20.130
Oh, hiya, P.J. What's up?

06:20.213 --> 06:21.756
Well, Max was wondering

06:21.840 --> 06:23.508
if you'd loan him something for the RV.

06:23.591 --> 06:25.885
Oh, like what? A spark plug?

06:25.969 --> 06:27.929
No, your garage door.

06:28.471 --> 06:30.140
Whoa!

06:31.224 --> 06:33.810
My door? But I just fixed it up.

06:33.893 --> 06:37.063
Yeah, well, Max says,
"Dear Dad, if you agree,

06:37.147 --> 06:39.357
I'm sure I can talk Pete
into taking us along

06:39.441 --> 06:40.525
on his Vegas trip."

06:40.608 --> 06:41.985
Las Vegas?

06:42.068 --> 06:44.404
Well, all right. Ah-hyuck!

06:44.487 --> 06:47.323
Now, how am I gonna get this down?

06:48.950 --> 06:50.243
[alarm sounds]

06:51.411 --> 06:54.247
Ah-hyuck. That was easy.

06:56.291 --> 06:59.836
The Pete-mobile is now
officially finished,

06:59.919 --> 07:01.254
and I want to thank you all

07:01.338 --> 07:03.798
for your generous contributions.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.759
So without further ado,

07:05.842 --> 07:09.971
the most luxurious RV in the world!

07:12.766 --> 07:14.309
[all] Ooh!

07:18.897 --> 07:20.732
[all] Ah!

07:26.571 --> 07:29.908
It's a home away from home.

07:31.284 --> 07:34.120
Yes, ha ha. Our home.

07:34.204 --> 07:38.249
And here's Max's brainstorm.
The comfort control center.

07:38.333 --> 07:39.417
Take it, pal.

07:39.501 --> 07:41.044
Thank you, Pete.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.713
Folks, with one finger
you can turn on the hot tub

07:43.797 --> 07:45.215
or open the sun roof.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.966
Let me demonstrate.

07:51.513 --> 07:52.847
Who wants some crushed ice?

07:52.931 --> 07:55.308
Oh, me, me, me! Pick me!
Pick me! Here, here!

07:55.392 --> 07:56.976
One snow cone coming up.

07:58.853 --> 08:02.273
Oh, golly, must have hooked up
a fuel line by mistake.

08:02.357 --> 08:05.443
That's it, no one's going
anywhere in this death trap.

08:05.527 --> 08:08.405
Uh, no, kumquat, it's OK, really.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.490
-It's, uh, it's--
-It's a crime deterrent.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.075
We planned it that way.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.785
Yeah, that's right. What he said.

08:13.868 --> 08:16.287
[sighs] Well...

08:16.371 --> 08:18.832
You're doin' great, Max.
My dad's really pleased.

08:18.915 --> 08:20.667
Where's my Mr. Chuckles?

08:20.750 --> 08:23.420
Oh, your punching toy.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.714
Follow Daddy to the cockpit, sweetheart.

08:27.549 --> 08:30.427
Here's Mr. Chuckles.

08:35.056 --> 08:37.350
-Make a note of that, Max.
-Check.

08:37.434 --> 08:41.354
Ahem. Now let me show you
the fuzz-buster instead.

08:42.564 --> 08:44.983
[giggling] Mr. Chuckles.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.484
It's an air bag.

08:46.568 --> 08:47.944
Right. Well, let's quit gabbing

08:48.028 --> 08:49.154
and start rolling.

08:49.237 --> 08:51.364
Las Vegas, here we come!

08:51.448 --> 08:52.657
[horn honks]

08:52.741 --> 08:53.825
[all] Yay!

08:53.908 --> 08:56.369
I've got dibs on shotgun!

08:56.453 --> 08:58.246
Uh, well, sorry, P.J.

08:58.329 --> 09:00.707
I sort of wanna discuss
some things with Max.

09:06.588 --> 09:07.964
Contact.

09:08.048 --> 09:12.510
Let's go, partner. Viva Las Vegas!

09:12.594 --> 09:13.762
Yeah!

09:18.600 --> 09:20.769
[engine sputtering]

09:20.852 --> 09:22.562
[Pete] Hmm. Gotta fix that.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.647
Get 'em up, move 'em out.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.399
[horn honks]

09:26.483 --> 09:27.859
[all cheering]

09:36.701 --> 09:38.411
Forgot it. Sorry.

09:39.621 --> 09:40.663
[door closes]

09:40.747 --> 09:42.916
OK, here we go.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.168
[all cheering]

09:51.800 --> 09:53.510
Sorry.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.303
[Pete] Here we go.

09:55.387 --> 09:57.263
[all] Yay!

09:57.430 --> 09:58.515
[tires screech]

10:01.768 --> 10:04.354
Left the cat in the dryer. Ah-hyuck!

10:04.437 --> 10:07.399
Here... we... go!

10:07.482 --> 10:08.900
[all] Yay.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.282
[toilet flushing]

10:17.325 --> 10:18.618
[Pistol] All set.

10:18.702 --> 10:19.994
That's it, you hear?

10:20.078 --> 10:21.996
We aren't stopping again
for anything, see?

10:22.080 --> 10:23.498
[tire bursts]

10:24.749 --> 10:27.752
[grunt]

10:31.756 --> 10:33.550
Well, Max, old boy,

10:33.633 --> 10:35.885
you sure talked me out of a jam back home.

10:35.969 --> 10:40.640
A real gift for gab. Join the club, kid.

10:40.724 --> 10:43.893
Wow. Thanks.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.895
[Goofy] Gonna try out the ol' hot tub.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.897
What's the matter, P.J.?

10:47.981 --> 10:50.900
Aw, Max is too busy being a phony-baloney

10:50.984 --> 10:52.652
to notice I'm even here.

10:52.736 --> 10:56.698
Aw, maybe he's just a little
mixed up right now.

10:56.781 --> 10:58.116
I know I am.

10:58.199 --> 10:59.701
Really. Here.

11:01.870 --> 11:05.582
Thanks. Why not talk to him, P.J.?

11:08.501 --> 11:10.754
-Hey, Max?
-Yo. Dude.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.881
We gotta talk again.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.718
Whoa. Where'd you get those?

11:16.801 --> 11:18.428
Your dad. Pretty cool, huh?

11:18.511 --> 11:21.473
He thinks I've got a great
future in sales.

11:21.556 --> 11:23.516
Yeah. You don't know my dad, Max.

11:23.600 --> 11:24.684
He's selling you, man,

11:24.768 --> 11:26.644
and I want us to stay friends.

11:26.728 --> 11:28.688
Hey, Peej, we're the gruesome twosome.

11:28.772 --> 11:31.524
