WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:02.870
HEY, GEORGE.

00:02.870 --> 00:05.739
JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH THE INSURANCE GUYS.

00:05.739 --> 00:07.741
WE HAVE A BRAND-NEW
HEALTH CARE PLAN.

00:07.741 --> 00:09.743
AS LONG AS THERE ARE
NO MORE CUTBACKS, JACK.

00:09.743 --> 00:12.713
THE ONLY DOCTOR WE HAVE
ON OUR PLAN NOW IS AT THE MALL.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.915
OF COURSE MY BLOOD PRESSURE
WAS GONNA BE HIGH.

00:14.915 --> 00:17.785
THE LINGERIE STORE HAD
BROWN MANNEQUINS IN THE WINDOW.

00:17.785 --> 00:19.587
THEY WERE LIKE THAT...
HELLO.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.155
NO, GEORGE.
NO MORE CUTBACKS.

00:21.155 --> 00:23.157
IN FACT,
THIS PLAN HAS EVERYTHING

00:23.157 --> 00:24.758
YOU AND THE WORKERS WANTED.

00:24.758 --> 00:26.760
THERE'S JUST, YOU KNOW,
ONE LITTLE CATCH.

00:26.760 --> 00:29.763
YOU GOTTA TELL 'EM THAT
IN ORDER TO AFFORD THIS,

00:29.763 --> 00:31.965
NOBODY AT THE FACTORY
CAN SMOKE ANYMORE--

00:31.965 --> 00:33.601
NOT HERE, NOT AT HOME.

00:33.601 --> 00:36.504
WHAT? YOU CAN'T TELL PEOPLE
WHAT TO DO IN THEIR OWN HOMES.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.806
WELL, MY LAWYERS TELL ME
THAT SINCE WE'RE PAYING

00:38.806 --> 00:40.774
FOR THE INSURANCE,
IT'S PERFECTLY LEGAL.

00:40.774 --> 00:43.777
THEY ALSO TELL ME THAT I CAN
DATE THAT BIG GIRL FROM SHIPPING

00:43.777 --> 00:47.948
IF I JUST MAKE HER
A SUBCONTRACTOR.

00:47.948 --> 00:49.617
I LOVE THOSE GUYS.

00:49.617 --> 00:54.122
JACK, THESE ARE THE SAME GUYS
THAT APPROVED THONG THURSDAY.

00:56.390 --> 00:59.427
YOU WANT TO SEE ERNIE COME
TO WORK LIKE THAT AGAIN?

00:59.427 --> 01:01.395
I DON'T.

01:01.395 --> 01:04.198
YOU TELL PEOPLE THEY CAN'T
SMOKE, THEY'RE GONNA GO CRAZY.

01:04.198 --> 01:06.700
LOOK, GEORGE,
WE'RE NOT HEARTLESS.

01:06.700 --> 01:09.703
WE'LL PROVIDE PATCHES, GUM,
THERAPY--WHATEVER IT TAKES.

01:09.703 --> 01:12.706
BESIDES, THEY'LL HAVE
A WHOLE MONTH TO QUIT.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.908
JACK, HALF THE WORKERS
ARE CHAIN SMOKERS.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.210
WHY DON'T YOU JUST FIRE

01:16.210 --> 01:18.212
EVERYONE WITH A TATTOO
OR CRIMINAL RECORD?

01:18.212 --> 01:19.713
THEN IT'LL JUST BE ME,

01:19.713 --> 01:21.715
YOU AND THAT BORN-AGAIN DUDE
IN ACCOUNTING.

01:21.715 --> 01:24.718
NO, IT'D JUST BE YOU
AND THE BORN-AGAIN DUDE, GEORGE.

01:24.718 --> 01:28.489
I GOT A LITTLE 4-LEAF CLOVER
SOUTH OF THE BORDER.

01:28.489 --> 01:32.326
IF SOMEONE'S LOOKING AT THAT,
THEIR LUCK HAS RUN OUT.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.567
ALL RIGHT,
EVERYONE LISTEN UP.

01:39.567 --> 01:42.636
I GOT SOME
VERY, VERY GOOD NEWS.

01:42.636 --> 01:45.639
WE HAVE A NEW HEALTH PLAN
WITH CHEAPER PRESCRIPTION DRUGS,

01:45.639 --> 01:48.809
DENTAL COVERAGE
AND LOWER CO-PAYS.

01:48.809 --> 01:51.145
(cheering)

01:51.145 --> 01:52.546
(man) WHOO!

01:52.546 --> 01:55.216
UH, THERE'S JUST,
UH, ONE LITTLE THING.

01:55.216 --> 01:58.386
IF YOU'RE A SMOKER,
UH, YOU HAVE TO QUIT.

01:58.386 --> 02:01.289
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, GEORGE?

02:01.289 --> 02:03.291
EVERYONE HAS A MONTH
TO QUIT SMOKING,

02:03.291 --> 02:04.725
OR ELSE THERE'LL BE, UH...

02:04.725 --> 02:07.861
Â¿SABES QUÃ©?
UH, REPERCUSSIONS.

02:07.861 --> 02:12.366
WHAT KIND OF REPERCUSSIONS,
LOPEZ?

02:12.366 --> 02:15.703
THE KIND THAT MAKE YOU
LOSE YOUR JOB.

02:15.703 --> 02:18.239
DON'T DO
ANYTHING CRAZY, CARL.

02:18.239 --> 02:21.442
NO JOB,
NO PROTEIN SHAKE MONEY.

02:21.442 --> 02:23.844
I JUST WANTED
TO THANK YOU.

02:23.844 --> 02:26.547
THIS IS THE INCENTIVE
I NEEDED TO QUIT. (laughs)

02:26.547 --> 02:29.550
OH! YOU GOT
YOUR NIPPLES PIERCED.

02:29.550 --> 02:32.920
I CAN FEEL THEM
THROUGH MY SHIRT.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.622
THAT'S NICE. (chuckles)

02:34.622 --> 02:38.058
YOU CAN'T MAKE US STOP SMOKING.
I KNOW MY RIGHTS.

02:38.058 --> 02:39.760
OF COURSE YOU DO.

02:39.760 --> 02:43.664
THEY'VE BEEN READ TO YOU EVERY
NEW YEAR'S EVE SINCE I WAS 7.

02:50.338 --> 02:51.739
WHERE'S MY MOM?

02:51.739 --> 02:53.741
OH, SHE'S IN THE LIVING ROOM
WATCHING TV.

02:53.741 --> 02:56.744
POOR THING IS READY
TO CRAWL OUT OF HER SKIN.

02:56.744 --> 02:58.946
WHAT DID YOU SAY
TO CONVINCE HER TO QUIT?

02:58.946 --> 03:02.516
THE SAME THING I WROTE
ON HER MOTHER'S DAY CARD.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.785
"YOU'RE OLD, AND YOU
BETTER NOT LOSE YOUR JOB,

03:04.785 --> 03:08.689
"BECAUSE Â¿SABES QUÃ©? I'M NOT
TAKING CARE OF YOUR ASS.

03:08.689 --> 03:12.360
WARMEST REGARDS,
YOUR SON, GEORGE."

03:12.360 --> 03:15.363
OH, BENNY. I MADE YOU
SOME CARROT STICKS.

03:15.363 --> 03:17.365
I THOUGHT MAYBE
THEY'D GIVE YOU

03:17.365 --> 03:19.132
SOMETHING TO HOLD
INSTEAD OF CIGARETTES.

03:19.132 --> 03:22.336
YOU KNOW WHAT I'D LIKE
TO HOLD IN MY HANDS RIGHT NOW?

03:22.336 --> 03:24.204
YOUR THROAT!

03:25.939 --> 03:29.743
FORGET THE CARROT STICKS.
I NEED A CHAIR AND A WHIP.

03:31.979 --> 03:33.381
HELLO, PRINCESS.

03:33.381 --> 03:35.616
DADDY, WHY ARE YOU STILL
WEARING YOUR SCRUBS?

03:35.616 --> 03:37.618
OH, I DIDN'T
HAVE TIME TO CHANGE

03:37.618 --> 03:40.120
BEFORE I LEFT
THE HOSPITAL AND...

03:40.120 --> 03:42.756
HE WEARS THEM TO THE GROCERY
STORE SO HE CAN MEET WOMEN.

03:44.658 --> 03:48.829
(imitating Vic) I NEED 200 c.c.s
OF MACARONI SALAD, STAT.

03:48.829 --> 03:51.465
OH, I'M SORRY.

03:51.465 --> 03:54.468
I THOUGHT I WAS STILL
AT THE HOSPITAL SAVING LIVES

03:54.468 --> 03:56.704
AND MAKING
MAD STACKS OF CASH.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.539
(normal voice)
HEY, VIC,

03:58.539 --> 04:00.541
YOU REMEMBER TO BRING
THE NICOTINE GUM FOR MY MOM?

04:00.541 --> 04:03.076
OH, YEAH.
HOW IS SHE DOING?

04:03.076 --> 04:04.512
YOU'LL SEE.

04:04.512 --> 04:07.114
JUST DON'T MAKE EYE CONTACT
WITH HER.

04:07.114 --> 04:08.949
I NEVER DO.

04:08.949 --> 04:10.851
SHE'S 4 FEET TALL.

04:12.620 --> 04:16.023
MOM, VIC BROUGHT YOU SOME MORE
OF THAT NICOTINE GUM.
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:16.023 --> 04:18.659
YOU CAN KEEP IT. THAT CRAP
DOESN'T WORK FOR ME.

04:18.659 --> 04:22.396
SO TRY THE PATCH. JUST STICK IT
ON AND FORGET ABOUT IT.

04:22.396 --> 04:25.399
THE AVERAGE PERSON
ONLY NEEDS ONE A DAY.

04:25.399 --> 04:28.802
WELL, I MUST
BE FREAKIN' SPECIAL.

04:30.538 --> 04:34.074
BENNY, YOU CAN'T WEAR
THREE PATCHES.

04:34.074 --> 04:35.876
IT'LL MAKE YOU SICK.

04:35.876 --> 04:37.345
NO, YOU IDIOT.

04:37.345 --> 04:40.514
THIS ONE'S SO I DON'T
GET KNOCKED UP.

04:44.652 --> 04:47.821
(coughs)
NOW ALL YOU NEED TO FIND

04:47.821 --> 04:50.090
IS A GUY WITH A PATCH
OVER EACH EYE,

04:50.090 --> 04:51.825
AND YOU'RE ALL SET.

04:51.825 --> 04:56.397
QUIT IT! SCREW THIS! I'M GONNA
GO TO MY HOUSE AND HAVE A SMOKE.

04:56.397 --> 04:58.198
NO WAY. YOU'RE GONNA
LOSE YOUR JOB.

04:58.198 --> 05:01.902
WELL, OKAY THEN. YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU ARE GONNA HAVE TO HELP ME.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.904
YOU'RE THE MANAGER.
YOU CAN COVER FOR ME.

05:03.904 --> 05:06.374
ARE YOU CRAZY?
THEN I'LL LOSE MY JOB.

05:06.374 --> 05:07.908
THANKS FOR NOTHING.

05:11.479 --> 05:13.914
WHY DON'T YOU GET
SOME CHAIRS THAT WORK?

05:16.049 --> 05:18.486
GEORGE, I DON'T THINK
SHE'S GONNA MAKE IT.

05:18.486 --> 05:20.488
SHE MAY NEED
PROFESSIONAL HELP.

05:20.488 --> 05:22.490
NO WAY.
SHE'LL NEVER GO FOR IT.

05:22.490 --> 05:25.258
WHAT IF SHE HAS A NERVOUS
BREAKDOWN OR SOMETHING?

05:25.258 --> 05:27.961
WHO'S GONNA TAKE CARE
OF HER THEN?

05:27.961 --> 05:31.231
THE CHURCH.

05:31.231 --> 05:32.733
SHE'S SMALL ENOUGH.

05:32.733 --> 05:35.268
WE'LL PUT HER IN A BASKET...

05:35.268 --> 05:39.473
LEAVE HER ON THE DOORSTEP,
RING THE BELL AND  VÃ¡MANOS!

05:39.473 --> 05:42.976
DING-DONG DITCH.

05:42.976 --> 05:46.146
WE CAN'T IGNORE THIS.
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

05:46.146 --> 05:48.348
LOOK, ANGIE, YOU GOTTA
GIVE HER CREDIT.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.552
I MEAN, SHE'S ALREADY GONE
A WEEK WITHOUT A CIGARETTE.

05:51.552 --> 05:54.154
SHE'S TOUGH.
SHE'LL MAKE IT.

05:54.154 --> 05:56.123
DAD, VERONICA'S HOGGING
THE BATHROOM AGAIN.

05:56.123 --> 05:58.626
SHE'S IN THERE DRYING HER HAIR
AND SHE WON'T LET ME IN.

05:58.626 --> 06:00.561
DO YOU REALLY NEED
TO USE THE BATHROOM,

06:00.561 --> 06:03.464
OR ARE YOU JUST TRYING
TO SNEAK IN THERE

06:03.464 --> 06:06.700
AND PEEK AT YOUR COUSIN
BLOW-DRYING HER HAIR AGAIN?
DAD, IF I REALLY WANTED
TO SPY ON HER,

06:06.700 --> 06:08.702
I'D LEAN A LADDER
AGAINST THE TREE

06:08.702 --> 06:11.338
AND USE THE PERISCOPE
I BUILT IN SHOP CLASS.

06:11.338 --> 06:13.674
SO THANK YOU
FOR NOT TRUSTING ME.

06:16.043 --> 06:19.780
(blow-dryer running)

06:19.780 --> 06:22.082
COME ON, VERONICA.
OPEN UP.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.717
I'M NOT IN THERE.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.719
I NEVER SHOWER
WHEN MAX IS HOME,

06:25.719 --> 06:29.222
NOT SINCE I FOUND HIM
IN THE HAMPER.

06:29.222 --> 06:33.060
(blow-dryer continues running)

06:34.528 --> 06:37.498
OH, QUÃ©LA. MOM.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.800
WHAT ARE YOU, 15?

06:39.800 --> 06:42.836
IT'S ONLY ONE CIGARETTE.
LEAVE ME ALONE.

06:42.836 --> 06:45.906
PUT IT OUT.
GET BACK!

06:45.906 --> 06:47.908
I'LL TURN THIS DRYER
ON HIGH

06:47.908 --> 06:51.244
AND SPLIT YOUR ENDS
RIGHT DOWN TO THE ROOT.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.747
I THINK SHE'S BLUFFING,
BUT YOU BETTER GO FIRST.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.849
YOUR HAIR'S
ALREADY DRIED OUT.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.417
WHAT?!

06:59.587 --> 07:02.790
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

07:06.259 --> 07:08.128
* ALL MY FRIENDS

07:08.128 --> 07:11.699
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

07:13.266 --> 07:14.635
* THE LOW RIDER

07:14.635 --> 07:18.338
* IS A LITTLE HIGHER

07:18.338 --> 07:21.842
**

07:28.081 --> 07:30.217
BENNY,
WE KNOW THIS IS HARD,

07:30.217 --> 07:32.252
BUT WE ONLY WANT TO HELP YOU.

07:32.252 --> 07:34.187
LET US BE A RESOURCE.

07:34.187 --> 07:37.558
SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
YOUR LANGUAGE. LET ME TRANSLATE.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.259
MOM,
PUT THE CIGARETTE DOWN,

07:39.259 --> 07:42.395
OR I WILL PLUNGE THE SMOKE
RIGHT OUT OF YOUR LITTLE--

07:42.395 --> 07:45.599
GEORGE, DON'T YOU DARE
TOUCH YOUR MOTHER WITH THAT.

07:45.599 --> 07:48.869
I'M GONNA CLEAN IT
BEFORE WE USE IT ON HER.

07:48.869 --> 07:51.004
MOM?

07:51.004 --> 07:52.940
FINE.

07:52.940 --> 07:55.042
I'M STARTING
TO LOSE IT, GEORGE.

07:55.042 --> 07:59.680
I HAVE BEEN SUCKING THE NICOTINE
STAINS OFF MY FINGERNAILS.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.682
I'M DOWN TO MY PINKIE,

08:01.682 --> 08:04.217
BUT I WAS SAVING IT
TILL AFTER DINNER.

08:04.217 --> 08:06.419
WE'VE GOT TO DO
SOMETHING ELSE, GEORGE.

08:06.419 --> 08:07.988
SHOCK THERAPY.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.423
I'LL FILL THE TUB WITH WATER.
YOU GET THE HAIR DRYER.

08:10.423 --> 08:12.793
WHAT'S GOING ON
UP HERE?

08:12.793 --> 08:14.595
IT'S MY MOM.
SHE'S IN BAD SHAPE.

08:14.595 --> 08:17.998
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN GIVE
HER TO GET HER THROUGH THIS?

08:17.998 --> 08:21.001
WELL, THERE ARE SOME DRUGS,
BUT I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THEM

08:21.001 --> 08:23.003
UNTIL SHE'S TRIED
BEHAVIORAL THERAPY.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.305
I KNOW SOMEONE
WHO CAN SEE YOU RIGHT AWAY.

08:25.305 --> 08:28.776
NO THERAPY.
I AM NOT A NUT JOB.

08:28.776 --> 08:30.110
YOU'RE STANDING ON TOILET

08:30.110 --> 08:32.279
AND YOU'RE SUCKING
YOUR FINGERNAILS.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.281
BENNY, PART OF TREATING
AN ADDICTION

08:34.281 --> 08:38.385
IS RECOGNIZING THE BEHAVIOR
THAT LEADS TO IT.

08:38.385 --> 08:41.454
MOM, IF YOU WANT, I CAN TAKE YOU
TO VIC'S GUY RIGHT NOW.

08:41.454 --> 08:43.023
HA! NEVER!

08:43.023 --> 08:45.926
YOU KNOW WHAT, BENNY?
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO THERAPY.

08:45.926 --> 08:49.296
YOU--YOU CAN COME DOWNSTAIRS
WITH ME, AND WE CAN GO ONLINE

08:49.296 --> 08:52.633
AND READ INSPIRATIONAL STORIES
OF REAL PEOPLE

08:52.633 --> 08:56.536
WHO HAVE CLIMBED THIS MOUNTAIN
AND COME OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE,

08:56.536 --> 09:00.073
SAFE AND WHOLE.

09:00.073 --> 09:04.144
VIC'S GUY IT IS.
I'LL MEET YOU IN THE CAR.

09:05.679 --> 09:08.081
THAT WAS UGLY, BUT IT WORKED.
GOOD JOB.

09:11.585 --> 09:13.587
BENNY, I KNOW YOU'RE
NOT HAPPY TO BE HERE,

09:13.587 --> 09:16.156
BUT I WANT YOU
TO KNOW THAT I...

09:16.156 --> 09:18.926
I SYMPATHIZE WITH EVERYTHING
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH,

09:18.926 --> 09:20.928
AND I'M GONNA DO
EVERYTHING IN MY POWER

09:20.928 --> 09:23.463
TO HELP YOU OVERCOME
YOUR ADDICTION.

09:23.463 --> 09:25.032
WHEN YOU SAY THAT,

09:25.032 --> 09:29.036
IT MAKES ME WANT TO SMASH
YOUR FACE WITH THIS PAPERWEIGHT.

09:29.036 --> 09:32.239
MOM, YOU SAID
YOU'D GIVE THIS A CHANCE.

09:32.239 --> 09:35.242
YOU'RE IN DANGER.
MAKE YOUR POINT QUICKLY.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.244
I JUST, UH,
I NEED SOME BACKGROUND

09:37.244 --> 09:40.480
SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT
TRIGGERS YOUR NEED TO SMOKE.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.015
NOW WHEN DID YOU START?

09:42.015 --> 09:45.018
UH, OH, LET'S SEE.
I WAS CRYING ALL THE TIME.

09:45.018 --> 09:47.621
I FELT TRAPPED.
I-I WANTED TO KILL MYSELF.

09:47.621 --> 09:49.757
OH, YEAH.
I WAS PREGNANT WITH HIM.

09:53.160 --> 09:56.396
YOU, UH, YOU STARTED SMOKING
WHEN YOU WERE PREGNANT?

09:56.396 --> 09:59.900
YEAH, I WAS TRYING
TO KEEP OFF THE WEIGHT.

10:01.268 --> 10:04.905
BUT, UH, AFTER YOU HAD GEORGE,
DID YOU TRY TO STOP?

10:04.905 --> 10:08.375
HELL NO.
I NEEDED TO SMOKE.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.744
I HAD TO HOLD DOWN TWO JOBS

10:10.744 --> 10:13.714
JUST TO FEED
THIS BOTTOMLESS PIT OVER HERE.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.415
YOU NEVER FED ME.

10:15.415 --> 10:17.918
ONE TIME I WAS SO HUNGRY

10:17.918 --> 10:21.121
I TRIED TO EAT THE BEANS
OUT OF A BEANBAG CHAIR.

10:22.690 --> 10:26.193
HERE WE GO.
THE NEEDLE ON THE RECORD.

10:26.193 --> 10:29.396
"SHE'S A BAD MOTHER.
I'M HUNGRY. I'M COLD.

10:29.396 --> 10:32.232
MY FOOT WON'T STOP HURTING."
(mutters)

10:33.867 --> 10:36.336
YOU DROVE OVER IT.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.138
YOU KNEW I WAS DRINKING.

10:38.138 --> 10:41.074
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
PLAYING ON THE LAWN, GEORGE.

10:42.943 --> 10:46.579
SO... THAT'S WHEN
I, UH, STARTED SMOKING.

10:46.579 --> 10:49.717
WELL, LET'S TRY TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S CAUSING YOUR STRESS NOW.

10:49.717 --> 10:51.618
DO YOU SMOKE AT WORK?

10:51.618 --> 10:54.387
OH, UH, MAYBE A-A LITTLE.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.056
EVERY TIME SHE COUGHS,

10:56.056 --> 10:59.860
SHE HACKS UP ENOUGH TAR
TO REPAVE THE PARKING LOT.

10:59.860 --> 11:02.662
OKAY, SO WORK. NOW, UH,
WHEN ELSE DO YOU SMOKE?

11:02.662 --> 11:04.564
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

11:04.564 --> 11:07.534
SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW, I LIKE
TO HAVE A SMOKE AFTER A MEAL.
MM-HMM.

11:07.534 --> 11:10.738
"AFTER A MEAL"? SHE EATS
AT MY HOUSE ALL THE TIME.

11:10.738 --> 11:12.639
SHE SMOKES DURING MEALS.
YOU CAN'T FOOL ANYBODY.

11:12.639 --> 11:14.942
THAT WASN'T STEAM
COMING OFF YOUR SOUP.
SHUT UP. (mutters)

11:14.942 --> 11:17.677
YOU SHUT UP.
(man) OKAY, HELLO? HELLO?

11:17.677 --> 11:19.212
WELL, IT, UH,

11:19.212 --> 11:22.950
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU TWO
SPEND A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER.

11:22.950 --> 11:24.952
I CAN'T
GET RID OF HER DOCTOR--

11:24.952 --> 11:26.954
CARPOOLS, WORK, AFTER WORK,
DINNER, HOLIDAYS, WEEKENDS,

11:26.954 --> 11:29.156
IN MY NIGHTMARES,
ASSORTED GATHERINGS...

11:29.156 --> 11:32.692
TAMBIÃ©N.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.494
OKAY, UH, WELL, MRS. LOPEZ,

11:34.494 --> 11:36.830
IT DOESN'T USUALLY HAPPEN
THIS QUICKLY,

11:36.830 --> 11:40.100
BUT I THINK
I FIGURED OUT YOUR TRIGGER.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.369
SEE? ALL THOSE DIPLOMAS
ON THE WALL, MOM,

11:42.369 --> 11:45.305
THEY MEAN SOMETHING.
LEARN FROM THIS MAN. LEARN.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.240
IT'S YOU, GEORGE.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.242
ME?!

11:49.242 --> 11:50.643
YOU'RE DONE, FOOL.

11:50.643 --> 11:54.247
COME ON PATCHES, LET'S GO
GET YOU SOME MORE OF THAT GUM.

11:54.247 --> 11:58.685
CLEARLY WHEN YOU'RE AROUND
YOUR MOM, SHE SMOKES MORE.

11:58.685 --> 12:00.220
FIGURES
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.222
YOU WISH IT WAS MY FAULT.
IT IS YOUR FAULT.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.224
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY, LOOK,
I KNOW IT'S HARD, GEORGE,

12:04.224 --> 12:05.959
BUT YOU'RE
HER STRESS TRIGGER.

12:05.959 --> 12:08.929
'STA LOCO STRESS TRIGGER.

12:08.929 --> 12:11.331
SHE'S THE ONE
THAT GIVES ME STRESS.

12:11.331 --> 12:14.634
TAMBIÃ©N, ANGINAS.

12:14.634 --> 12:16.603
DIDN'T YOU HEAR
WHAT I SAID, MAN?

12:16.603 --> 12:19.106
I ATE A CHAIR!

12:27.047 --> 12:29.582
WELL, HOW'D IT GO?

12:29.582 --> 12:32.585
IT WAS A COMPLETE WASTE
OF TIME.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.654
I LOVED IT.
THE GUY'S A GENIUS.

12:34.654 --> 12:36.123
LET ME GUESS.

12:36.123 --> 12:37.457
YOUR ADDICTIVE PERSONALITY

12:37.457 --> 12:40.293
IS A RESULT
OF YOUR UNSTABLE CHILDHOOD.

12:40.293 --> 12:44.832
NO, I SMOKE BECAUSE GEORGE
IS A WHINY LITTLE GIRL.

12:46.366 --> 12:49.569
THAT DOCTOR DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
THE HELL HE WAS TALKING ABOUT.

12:49.569 --> 12:51.304
HE WASN'T EVEN A REAL DOCTOR.

12:51.304 --> 12:53.974
I TRIED TO SHOW HIM
THE MOLE ON MY BACK.

12:53.974 --> 12:56.409
HE WAS LIKE, "SIR,
PLEASE PULL YOUR PANTS UP."

12:56.409 --> 13:00.747
WHY DO YOU SHOW THAT THING
TO EVERYBODY?

13:00.747 --> 13:02.549
SHE WAS
A HORRIBLE MOTHER,

13:02.549 --> 13:05.218
BUT I'M THE BAD GUY
FOR COMPLAINING ABOUT IT.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.354
I AGREE. SHE WAS AWFUL.

13:07.354 --> 13:10.958
BUT IF THE DOCTOR SAYS
THAT YOU'RE MAKING HER SMOKE,

13:10.958 --> 13:13.026
MAYBE YOU CAN
CUT HER SOME SLACK.

13:13.026 --> 13:15.162
DO YOU REALLY
HAVE TO COMPLAIN?

13:15.162 --> 13:17.164
YES, BECAUSE NOW I CAN.

13:17.164 --> 13:19.166
WHEN I WAS A KID,
EVERY TIME I COMPLAINED,

13:19.166 --> 13:21.134
SHE'D SMACK ME
UPSIDE THE HEAD

13:21.134 --> 13:24.304
AND SAY, "THANK YOU FOR VISITING
THE COMPLAINT DEPARTMENT."

13:24.304 --> 13:27.007
IT WAS THE ONLY DEPARTMENT
IN HER STORE,

13:27.007 --> 13:30.277
AND IT DRANK A LOT.

13:30.277 --> 13:33.613
THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO,

13:33.613 --> 13:37.184
A-AND THERE'S SOMETHING
MORE IMPORTANT HAPPENING HERE.

13:37.184 --> 13:40.153
WE ALL KNOW WHERE
THE SMOKING IS LEADING TO.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.155
DO YOU REALLY WANT
TO WATCH YOUR MOM

13:42.155 --> 13:44.291
DIE A SLOW, PAINFUL DEATH?

13:45.458 --> 13:47.460
IF HER EYES ROLL BACK
IN HER HEAD

13:47.460 --> 13:49.496
AND HER ARMS SHAKE
LIKE A LITTLE BUG,

13:49.496 --> 13:52.299
YEAH, I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT.
GEORGE.

13:52.299 --> 13:54.367
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN HER LIFE,

13:54.367 --> 13:57.370
YOUR MOTHER HAS A REAL REASON
TO QUIT, A-AND IF YOU HELP HER,

13:57.370 --> 13:59.372
IT WON'T JUST
BE GOOD FOR HER,

13:59.372 --> 14:01.608
IT'LL BE EMOTIONALLY HEALTHY
FOR YOU.

14:01.608 --> 14:02.910
BUT I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

14:02.910 --> 14:05.445
WHY DO I HAVE
TO BE EMOTIONALLY HEALTHY?

14:05.445 --> 14:08.615
BECAUSE
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

14:11.551 --> 14:12.685
MOM?

14:12.685 --> 14:14.054
YEAH?

14:14.054 --> 14:17.657
ARE, UH... YOU STILL GONNA
TRY TO QUIT SMOKING?

14:17.657 --> 14:18.858
(sniffs)

14:18.858 --> 14:20.660
NO, I WANT TO LOSE A JOB

14:20.660 --> 14:24.031
AND LIVE IN A SMALL BOX
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD.

14:24.031 --> 14:26.366
WHAT KIND OF A DUMB QUESTION
IS THAT?

14:27.800 --> 14:29.937
OKAY, UH, HERE'S THE DEAL.

14:29.937 --> 14:32.205
I'M GONNA TRY
TO STOP COMPLAINING

14:32.205 --> 14:35.208
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO BE YOUR EXCUSE FOR SMOKING.

14:35.208 --> 14:38.211
SO IF YOU CAN'T QUIT,

14:38.211 --> 14:40.213
IT'S 'CAUSE YOU'RE
SELF-DESTRUCTIVE, UNDISCIPLINED,

14:40.213 --> 14:41.915
AND YOU NEVER GAVE ME
A BIRTHDAY PARTY

14:41.915 --> 14:44.985
WHEN I WAS A KID!
GEORGE.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.987
STARTING NOW.

14:46.987 --> 14:49.489
YOU'RE GONNA TRY?
HA! GOOD LUCK.

14:49.489 --> 14:53.526
I WATCHED YOU TRY TO LEARN
TO SKATEBOARD, RIDE A BIKE,

14:53.526 --> 14:55.262
USE A TOILET.

14:55.262 --> 14:58.665
YOU FELL OVER
AND HIT YOUR HEAD EVERY TIME.

14:58.665 --> 15:01.301
WELL,
WHAT CAN I SAY, MOM?

15:01.301 --> 15:03.436
I WAS A CLUMSY LITTLE BOY.

15:03.436 --> 15:06.473
BUT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT
TO TRY IT, GO FOR IT.

15:06.473 --> 15:07.607
FINE WITH ME.

15:07.607 --> 15:10.610
IT WOULD BE SO NICE
NOT TO HAVE TO LISTEN

15:10.610 --> 15:13.913
TO A GROWN MAN COMPLAIN
LIKE A 3 YEAR OLD.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.782
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:15.782 --> 15:17.584
PICK ME UP TOMORROW
AT 8:00.

15:17.584 --> 15:20.353
OH, AND TRY NOT
TO FALL OFF THE CAN.

15:20.353 --> 15:24.624
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO HIT YOUR HEAD AND FORGET.

15:32.565 --> 15:35.969
HEY. MAN, IT'S NICE TO GO
DOWN TO THE LOADING DOCK

15:35.969 --> 15:38.038
AND NOT HAVE TO SMELL
CIGARETTE SMOKE.

15:38.038 --> 15:40.040
NOW IT'S JUST TRUCK EXHAUST

15:40.040 --> 15:42.042
AND, UH, THE FUMES
FROM THAT GREEN STUFF

15:42.042 --> 15:44.777
THE GOVERNMENT
WON'T LET US THROW AWAY.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.146
MMM. MM-HMM.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.715
OH, YOU MUST HAVE GOT
THE LAST FRUIT PIE.

15:48.715 --> 15:50.750
THE VENDING MACHINE'S
ALL SOLD OUT.

15:50.750 --> 15:53.453
THE WORKERS CAN'T SMOKE,
SO THEY'RE EATING.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.787
OH.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.824
HEY, SO HOW'S IT GOING
WITH NOT INSULTING YOUR MOM?

15:57.824 --> 16:00.527
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN
TWO WEEKS, AND IT...

16:00.527 --> 16:02.529
(sniffs)
GETS EASIER ALL THE TIME.

16:02.529 --> 16:05.098
YOU JUST NEED DISCIPLINE
AND SELF-CONTROL.

16:12.039 --> 16:14.207
MAN, LOOK AT ALL THESE
FRUIT PIE WRAPPERS.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.978
YOU ATE THEM ALL!

16:20.880 --> 16:23.816
Ã³RALE, C.S. PIE.

16:23.816 --> 16:26.986
GO INVESTIGATE
SOMEONE ELSE.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.495
IT'S 11:00, AND YOU'RE JUST
PUNCHING IN NOW?

16:35.495 --> 16:41.634
OH. I HAD ONE OF MY REALLY,
REALLY BAD NIGHTS, GEORGE.

16:41.634 --> 16:44.304
I KEPT HAVING THIS NIGHTMARE
THAT THIS FAT-HEADED KID

16:44.304 --> 16:49.842
KEPT CRYING, "PLAY WITH ME.
PLAY WITH ME,"

16:49.842 --> 16:53.380
AND ALL I WANTED WAS TO HAVE
A CIGARETTE AND SMACK HIM.

16:53.380 --> 16:56.183
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

16:56.183 --> 16:58.017
IT MEANS THAT, YOU KNOW,

16:58.017 --> 17:01.754
YOU'RE FIGHTING AN ADDICTION,
AND IT'S OKAY THAT YOU'RE LATE.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.123
EXCUSE ME.

17:06.893 --> 17:08.228
(machine beeps)

17:08.228 --> 17:11.498
OH, NO, GEORGE.
GEORGE, STOP!

17:11.498 --> 17:14.701
THIS IS EMOTIONAL EATING, OKAY?
I USED TO BE BIG. I KNOW.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.437
YOU'RE EATING BECAUSE YOU'RE
STRESSED OUT ABOUT YOUR MOM.

17:17.437 --> 17:19.439
I'M NOT STRESSED OUT, MAN.
I'M JUST HUNGRY.

17:19.439 --> 17:20.740
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.975
OH, THIS IS SO GOOD,
I CAN'T BELIEVE.

17:22.975 --> 17:26.012
GEORGE, GEORGE, I NEED FOR YOU
TO ADD THIS INVOICE, OKAY?

17:26.012 --> 17:27.580
IT'S GONNA BE OVER TEN,

17:27.580 --> 17:31.151
SO I'LL WAIT WHILE YOU TAKE OFF
YOUR SHOES AND SOCKS.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.320
YOU MISERABLE, OLD--

17:33.320 --> 17:35.922
HUH. I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT
RIGHT NOW.

17:35.922 --> 17:37.824
I'LL TAKE THOSE.

17:37.824 --> 17:40.827
HEY, THERE'S NOTHING BUT APPLES
AND PEARS IN THERE.

17:40.827 --> 17:44.331
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO EAT?
WHAT'S WITH HIM?

17:44.331 --> 17:47.734
I THINK IT'S YOU.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.102
YEAH.

17:49.102 --> 17:51.404
HE'S EATING
TO STUFF DOWN HIS FEELINGS

17:51.404 --> 17:53.706
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT
TO INSULT YOU.

17:53.706 --> 17:56.676
HEY, I DIDN'T ASK HIM
TO DO THAT.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.678
YOU KNOW,
I'VE KNOWN YOU A LONG TIME,

17:58.678 --> 18:01.948
AND I'VE NEVER TOLD YOU THIS,
BUT YOU'RE A COLD WOMAN.

18:01.948 --> 18:03.316
HUH?

18:03.316 --> 18:05.318
YOUR SON
IS EATING HIMSELF SICK

18:05.318 --> 18:08.288
TO TRY AND KEEP YOU FROM KILLING
YOURSELF WITH CIGARETTES,

18:08.288 --> 18:10.623
AND YOU DON'T EVEN
APPRECIATE IT.

18:10.623 --> 18:14.694
YOU KNOW, UM, MY LUNGS
ARE WORKING AGAIN...

18:16.062 --> 18:19.399
AND I CAN RUN YOU DOWN
LIKE A DOG.

18:19.399 --> 18:21.768
YEAH, WELL,
IT'S JUST A THEORY.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.203
I'LL CATCH YOU LATER.

18:38.785 --> 18:43.690
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE!

18:43.690 --> 18:45.725
I'M LIGHTING UP.

18:48.695 --> 18:50.630
MOM,
WHAT THE HELL YOU DOING?

18:50.630 --> 18:53.166
(sighs)
I'M GETTING FIRED.

18:53.166 --> 18:55.835
I AM WHO I AM, GEORGE.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.304
I'M A SMOKER.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.172
IT'S MORE THAN
AN ADDICTION.

18:59.172 --> 19:00.640
IT'S A LIFESTYLE CHOICE,

19:00.640 --> 19:04.411
LIKE BEING A CROSS-DRESSER
OR--OR A TERRORIST.

19:04.411 --> 19:06.713
BUT YOU'VE BEEN HERE
FOR 40 YEARS.

19:06.713 --> 19:08.715
I MEAN,
WHERE YOU GONNA GO?

19:08.715 --> 19:11.318
OH, COME ON.
I'LL FIND ANOTHER JOB.

19:11.318 --> 19:12.652
I'LL JUST LIVE CHEAPER.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.855
I JUST KNOW THAT I GOTTA
GET OUT OF HERE, GEORGE.

19:15.855 --> 19:17.657
BOY, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.792
IT'S BEEN PURE HELL
THESE LAST FEW WEEKS.

19:19.792 --> 19:22.862
NOW YOU KNOW WHAT THE FIRST
18 YEARS OF MY LIFE WERE LIKE,

19:22.862 --> 19:25.998
YOU BITTER OLD TROLL!

19:25.998 --> 19:28.835
OH, THAT FELT SO GOOD!

19:28.835 --> 19:33.172
ALL RIGHT.
EVERYTHING IS BACK TO NORMAL.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.309
NOW YOU CAN STOP
STUFFING YOUR FACE.

19:38.345 --> 19:39.712
WAIT A MINUTE.

19:39.712 --> 19:43.182
YOU'RE NOT QUITTING
SO YOU CAN SMOKE.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.385
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT ME.

19:45.385 --> 19:48.255
YES, IT'S ALL ABOUT YOU.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.260
WHY DOES THE SUN RISE
IN THE MORNING?

19:53.260 --> 19:55.695
BECAUSE GEORGE
IS AFRAID OF THE DARK.

19:55.695 --> 19:58.231
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO LEAVE, MOM.

19:58.231 --> 20:01.434
I MEAN, IT'S BEEN TOUGH NOT
BEING ABLE TO INSULT YOU,

20:01.434 --> 20:02.735
BUT, YOU KNOW,

20:02.735 --> 20:05.137
I'LL FIND A WAY
TO DEAL WITH IT.

20:05.137 --> 20:07.407
HOW? LOOK AT YOU.

20:07.407 --> 20:09.576
YOUR POCKETS
ARE STUFFED WITH CANDY.

20:09.576 --> 20:12.812
YOU GOT PIE
ALL OVER YOUR FACE.

20:12.812 --> 20:16.215
YOU'RE NOT A MAN ANYMORE.
YOU'RE A TRICK-OR-TREATER.

20:18.017 --> 20:20.086
SIT DOWN.

20:20.086 --> 20:23.523
LET'S TALK.
COME ON.

20:23.523 --> 20:25.592
LET'S BE HONEST,
GEORGE.

20:25.592 --> 20:28.961
WE HAVE BEEN THE WAY WE ARE
FOR OVER 40 YEARS.

20:28.961 --> 20:30.763
WE'RE NOT GONNA CHANGE NOW.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.699
I MEAN,
YOU KNOW, WHO KNOWS?

20:32.699 --> 20:34.734
MAYBE NOT BEING AROUND YOU
ALL THE TIME,

20:34.734 --> 20:37.737
IT'LL BE EASIER FOR ME
TO QUIT SMOKING.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.673
YOU'RE REALLY GONNA
LEAVE THE FACTORY?

20:43.109 --> 20:44.544
YEAH.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.214
HEY.

20:48.214 --> 20:51.984
I KNOW YOU REALLY
CAN'T SAY IT, BUT...

20:51.984 --> 20:54.854
I KNOW WHY YOU'RE DOING THIS.
THANKS, MOM.

20:56.856 --> 20:59.526
I CAN SAY IT.

20:59.526 --> 21:03.530
GEORGIE, THE TRUTH IS,

21:03.530 --> 21:06.733
WITH ALL THE CRAP
I'VE GONE THROUGH IN MY LIFE,

21:06.733 --> 21:09.536
THERE'S REALLY
ONLY ONE THING

21:09.536 --> 21:12.038
THAT'S EVER
BROUGHT ME HAPPINESS.

21:12.038 --> 21:13.773
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY IT.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.975
CIGARETTES.

21:20.580 --> 21:22.549
THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T
WANT YOU TO SAY IT.
