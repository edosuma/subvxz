00:23.240 --> 00:26.312
Hey, Mr. White. It's me. Um,

00:26.480 --> 00:30.190
I know you're probably
real busy with retirement

00:30.360 --> 00:33.080
but I got some news I think
you should maybe know about.

00:33.280 --> 00:35.476
Me and Declan had some
differences of opinion

00:35.680 --> 00:37.273
and it got a little...

00:38.080 --> 00:40.879
messy. Um...

00:41.400 --> 00:43.119
It's all straightened out now

00:43.280 --> 00:46.398
but just a heads-up, there's been
a kind of change in management.

00:46.560 --> 00:48.791
Anyway, just thought
you should know.

00:48.960 --> 00:51.475
Feel free to give me a call
if you want the details

00:51.640 --> 00:53.791
but, you know, it's cool,
so whatever.

00:54.240 --> 00:56.630
Okay, then. Thanks. Bye.

00:57.280 --> 00:59.795
<i>Right, so there I am,
I'm on top of the train,</i>

00:59.960 --> 01:02.350
pumping the water in,
he's watching to make sure we put in

01:02.520 --> 01:04.830
exactly what he'd calculated.

01:05.040 --> 01:06.595
We gotta be real precise because...

01:06.795 --> 01:08.351
water and methylene weigh different

01:08.560 --> 01:10.040
and he figured it all out

01:10.200 --> 01:12.590
to, like, milliliter.
I'm up there with my hose,

01:12.800 --> 01:15.474
we're going as fast as we can.
We only got a few minutes.

01:15.640 --> 01:18.792
At the crossing, we got this guy
who's smooth-talking the engineer.

01:18.960 --> 01:20.519
And it's all just going great

01:20.720 --> 01:24.350
until this other dude shows up
in this monster truck

01:24.560 --> 01:27.075
so we're pretty much screwed,
because he can just push

01:27.240 --> 01:30.711
the entire dump truck off the tracks,
which, you know, is what he does.

01:30.880 --> 01:32.200
Wait. What's your guy doing?

01:32.400 --> 01:34.915
You can't stop him?
Yeah, but what's he gonna say?

01:35.080 --> 01:39.677
"Thanks anyway, sir, but my friends
are still stealing cargo back there."

01:39.840 --> 01:42.480
So I'm looking all around,
because I know we're not done,

01:42.640 --> 01:44.597
but the gallons
are slowly ticking away.

01:44.760 --> 01:46.592
And finally Mr. White
tells me to cut it.

01:46.760 --> 01:48.084
So I fling the hose,

01:48.184 --> 01:49.958
I'm grabbing the cap,
I'm screwing in the bolts.

01:50.120 --> 01:52.112
Just, like, busting ass, you know?

01:52.280 --> 01:57.594
And then I feel the train
start moving and I'm...

01:57.800 --> 01:59.519
You're...
I'm on top.

01:59.720 --> 02:02.155
Did you piss your pants?
Yeah, right?

02:02.320 --> 02:06.633
So the thing starts speeding up,
so I jump off the moving train.

02:06.800 --> 02:08.074
Like, total stuntman stuff.

02:08.240 --> 02:10.596
It's like <i>Hooper.</i>
You ever see <i>Hooper?</i>

02:10.759 --> 02:12.558
Oh, hey, man, Burt Reynolds.
Good movie.

02:12.720 --> 02:14.552
He jumped out of a helicopter,
not a train.

02:14.720 --> 02:16.154
Whatever, man.
It's a good movie.

02:16.360 --> 02:19.990
This guy Jesse, he's underneath,
and the train just drives right over him.

02:20.200 --> 02:22.510
And luckily
he's this skinny little guy.

02:22.880 --> 02:25.634
Damn.
That's a tight operation.

02:25.800 --> 02:28.395
It was perfect.

02:29.080 --> 02:32.710
No one even knew they got robbed,
just like we planned.

02:32.920 --> 02:36.630
Mr. White told me it was, like,
the biggest train heist ever,

02:36.840 --> 02:38.638
like, potential money-wise.

02:38.840 --> 02:40.991
So that's how that happened.
Ha, ha.

02:49.640 --> 02:51.597
Can I get you anything else?

02:52.160 --> 02:53.879
Nope. Thanks, darling.

02:54.040 --> 02:56.077
I'm ready for the check.

03:10.600 --> 03:13.240
You feeling good
about cooking?

03:14.040 --> 03:15.872
Yeah.

03:17.040 --> 03:19.874
You'll be able to
run your own lab?

03:20.040 --> 03:22.839
Do it up right?
Yeah. For sure. I got this.

03:26.360 --> 03:27.953
All right.

03:28.600 --> 03:32.480
Let's make some money, then.
I gotta hit the head.

03:38.160 --> 03:39.992
Ever been on a plane
and find yourself

03:40.160 --> 03:42.356
looking down at the armrest
next to you,

03:42.520 --> 03:46.560
looking at the little plug
where the ashtray used to go?

03:46.720 --> 03:48.008
I look at that and I say,

03:48.208 --> 03:50.270
"What the hell happened to this country?"

03:50.440 --> 03:51.794
Nanny state.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.832
I see a kid with
a bicycle helmet on,

03:54.040 --> 03:57.556
I wanna smack the shit out of him,
like, for his own good.

04:31.440 --> 04:33.477
<i># Gonna romp, stomp
Swing with you, baby #</i>

04:33.640 --> 04:35.757
<i># Gonna romp, stomp
Sway with you, baby #</i>

04:35.960 --> 04:37.758
<i># Gonna romp, stomp
Rock with you, baby #</i>

04:37.960 --> 04:39.872
<i># Gonna romp, stomp
Roll with you, baby #</i>

04:40.040 --> 04:45.354
<i># Gonna romp, stomp
Romp and stomp tonight ##</i>

05:41.040 --> 05:42.474
Mr. Pinkman.

05:43.120 --> 05:45.032
How are you today?

05:46.240 --> 05:47.276
Not so good, huh?

05:48.480 --> 05:53.191
Of course, I might be able
to help you out.

05:54.320 --> 05:57.597
I wanna talk to you about
your partner, Heisenberg.

05:58.440 --> 06:01.558
See, I know
he's my brother-in-law, Walt.

06:03.360 --> 06:06.831
Oh, yeah. That's the look.

06:09.840 --> 06:14.437
Lucky for you,
I'm more interested in him.

06:14.840 --> 06:16.832
So I got an offer.

06:17.800 --> 06:19.996
If you help me out here,

06:21.120 --> 06:26.559
tell me all about you and him
and your little meth business,

06:27.360 --> 06:30.558
maybe I talk to my friends
at the A.P.D.

06:30.760 --> 06:32.752
and make all this go away.

06:34.360 --> 06:37.080
I know he's the mastermind here.

06:37.640 --> 06:39.313
Plus...

06:40.400 --> 06:43.871
I'm thinking,
based on your recent activities,

06:44.040 --> 06:48.432
that maybe there's
a little trouble in paradise?

06:49.360 --> 06:53.354
Maybe you guys aren't
getting along so good?

06:55.200 --> 06:56.919
I'm right, aren't I?

06:57.760 --> 06:59.638
Eat me.

07:01.640 --> 07:04.155
Sure that's how
you want to play this?

07:05.240 --> 07:09.120
Why don't you try
and beat it out of me?

07:10.000 --> 07:12.595
That's your thing, right?

07:22.200 --> 07:24.590
He really did a number on you,
didn't he?

07:31.800 --> 07:33.996
I don't know,

07:35.280 --> 07:39.957
but happy people
usually don't go around

07:41.200 --> 07:43.715
throwing millions of dollars away.

07:45.120 --> 07:47.316
I don't think

07:47.520 --> 07:51.230
Walt's gonna be patting you
on the back for that.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.917
But maybe that's the point.

07:57.320 --> 07:59.152
But, you see, I get that.

07:59.840 --> 08:01.877
My own brother-in-law,

08:02.080 --> 08:05.152
lying to me for over a year.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.279
Using me.

08:09.560 --> 08:11.995
Maybe you understand
that feeling.

08:16.040 --> 08:18.350
Help me out here, Jesse...

08:20.000 --> 08:21.798
and we can put him away.

08:23.560 --> 08:25.597
I know you want that.

08:27.880 --> 08:29.872
I think you wanna talk.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.153
Not to you.

08:38.480 --> 08:41.154
Agent Schrader,
beat any good suspects lately?

08:41.320 --> 08:44.073
Tall and taller, ask him
about his history with my client.

08:44.240 --> 08:47.074
He knocked the poor kid unconscious
last time they were alone.

08:47.240 --> 08:50.312
So, what'll it be, a civil rights
lawsuit the size of Montana?

08:50.480 --> 08:52.039
Because I'll oblige you.

08:52.840 --> 08:55.230
Oh. So long, Rocky.
Keep your left up.

08:55.400 --> 08:57.357
Detectives,
I'm inviting you to leave.

08:58.160 --> 08:59.753
I'm gonna try to remain calm,

08:59.920 --> 09:03.470
but will you do me a favor
and tell me what is up with you?

09:03.640 --> 09:06.792
My guys are busting their asses

09:06.960 --> 09:10.397
trying to hide Walt's money
from the feds

09:10.560 --> 09:12.711
and you're tossing yours
out a window?

09:12.880 --> 09:17.352
And I have to hear about your little act
of philanthropy on the news?

09:17.520 --> 09:19.318
Did you hit your head
or something?

09:19.480 --> 09:22.200
Why didn't you call me
the second you got arrested?

09:22.360 --> 09:24.079
What did you say
to Schrader?

09:24.240 --> 09:26.152
Nothing. Jesus. Just chill out.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.880
Chill out? No.
No, I don't chill out right now

09:29.040 --> 09:31.475
because things
have gone nuclear.

09:32.120 --> 09:36.194
I imagine Schrader shared
with you his recent discovery.

09:37.040 --> 09:40.431
Okay, well, then you get
my complete lack of chill.

09:42.640 --> 09:45.360
Just use the money
that I gave you.

09:45.560 --> 09:47.313
No, Saul. Saul, I...

09:47.520 --> 09:48.510
Stop... Saul.

09:48.680 --> 09:52.037
Stop talking. I don't care.

09:52.200 --> 09:55.716
Just... Just make it happen.
Work your magic.

09:55.880 --> 09:57.997
And call me when he's out.

09:58.200 --> 09:59.873
Hey, Dad, I'm home.

10:00.040 --> 10:02.600
Oh, okay. I'll be right out.

10:02.760 --> 10:06.754
Hey, you going to work today?
You were out late last night.

10:07.480 --> 10:10.075
Huh? I... Well, I, uh...

10:10.240 --> 10:13.233
Yeah, I guess I just lost track of time.

10:40.720 --> 10:42.473
Dad.
Huh?

10:42.640 --> 10:45.474
I'm gonna head out, okay?

10:46.280 --> 10:49.717
Where you going?
Uh, Aunt Marie just called.

10:49.880 --> 10:54.079
She wants me to help her
with some computer thing

10:54.240 --> 10:56.277
and asked me to stay for dinner.

10:56.440 --> 10:57.999
That cool?

10:59.640 --> 11:02.394
Uh... I guess that...

11:02.560 --> 11:04.756
Cool. All right, see you later.

11:05.920 --> 11:08.310
Wait, uh, son?

11:08.520 --> 11:10.352
Junior. Hang on a second.
Yeah?

11:10.560 --> 11:13.473
Oh, good. Come on back inside.
What happened?

11:13.640 --> 11:15.996
Oh, this? Nothing.
No, I'm fine. It's fine.

11:16.160 --> 11:18.072
Really. I do wanna talk to you, though.

11:18.280 --> 11:20.078
Okay. Are you okay?

11:20.280 --> 11:22.351
Yeah. Here.
Sit down a second.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.794
I just don't wanna keep things
from you, okay?

11:30.000 --> 11:32.117
I mean, you deserve to know
what's happening.

11:35.240 --> 11:37.311
Yesterday, I passed out.

11:37.480 --> 11:39.551
Briefly. Very, very briefly.

11:39.760 --> 11:40.796
And I did this.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.715
Why did you pass out?

11:45.880 --> 11:50.159
Well, my latest scans

11:50.320 --> 11:55.395
show a little shadow on my lung.

11:56.120 --> 12:00.034
But my doctor put me right on
a new round of chemo,

12:00.240 --> 12:02.311
which is why
I've been so tired lately.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.233
But I was pushing myself too hard.

12:04.400 --> 12:07.393
I know it.
I just don't want you to worry.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.596
I learned my lesson.

12:09.280 --> 12:12.239
Well, um, what's the...?

12:13.760 --> 12:15.160
What now?

12:15.880 --> 12:20.796
What now is that we go on,
like always. Right?

12:23.320 --> 12:25.880
Hey, don't worry about this,
okay?

12:26.040 --> 12:29.033
I know that's hard,
but I beat this once.

12:29.200 --> 12:32.113
There's no reason to think
I won't again.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.551
And my doctor says
I'm doing great.

12:35.720 --> 12:38.474
I'm responding really well
to the treatment.

12:38.640 --> 12:40.359
And I'm...

12:40.520 --> 12:45.037
I'm feeling very...
Very good about this, all right?

12:45.240 --> 12:47.800
And what would really
help me out

12:48.320 --> 12:51.074
is if we all stayed positive.

12:51.920 --> 12:53.718
Can we do that?

12:55.200 --> 12:56.998
Yeah?

12:57.480 --> 12:58.550
Hm?

12:58.720 --> 13:00.632
Okay.

13:02.200 --> 13:04.351
So why don't you go
and help your Aunt Marie

13:04.560 --> 13:09.510
and we'll talk about this later?
No. No. No way.

13:09.720 --> 13:13.396
I'm staying. I'm not leaving.

13:22.800 --> 13:24.917
Flynn is not with you, is he?
No.

13:25.080 --> 13:26.912
No. Why would he be?

13:29.120 --> 13:30.759
How'd it go?

13:31.720 --> 13:33.791
That bad, huh?

13:35.400 --> 13:37.756
How bad are we talking, Hank?

13:40.440 --> 13:42.238
I didn't tell them.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.959
Why not?

13:45.920 --> 13:49.436
It's just not time yet.
No, it's past time.

13:49.640 --> 13:52.109
Way past time.
We talked about this.

13:52.280 --> 13:54.636
You've got to tell them now.
It's gonna be worse

13:54.800 --> 13:57.713
if they find out that
you've kept this from them.

13:57.880 --> 14:01.112
Look, it's just I've got some things
I gotta chase down.

14:01.280 --> 14:03.078
What? What things?

14:03.800 --> 14:04.995
Leads, you know.

14:05.160 --> 14:06.992
What leads? What? Something new?

14:07.200 --> 14:09.920
I'm not keeping anything from anybody,
Marie, okay? Jesus.

14:10.080 --> 14:12.231
Don't tell me how to do my job.

14:17.080 --> 14:19.151
Walt.

14:20.280 --> 14:22.715
Are you sure about this?

14:24.480 --> 14:26.597
It's the only way.

14:31.160 --> 14:32.435
Okay.

14:38.680 --> 14:40.637
I'm ready.

14:43.960 --> 14:46.714
My name is Walter Hartwell White.

14:46.880 --> 14:49.315
I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane,

14:49.480 --> 14:53.235
Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.791
This is my confession.

15:17.720 --> 15:19.552
They're here.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.276
Thank you for coming.

15:52.480 --> 15:55.837
Okay, I'll start.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.674
Skyler and I...
Welcome to GarduÃ±o's.

15:58.840 --> 16:01.036
My name is Trent.
I'll be taking care of you.

16:01.100 --> 16:03.411
Can I start anybody off with some beverages?

16:03.611 --> 16:04.113
Margarita?

16:04.280 --> 16:06.670
How about some of
our tableside guacamole?

16:06.840 --> 16:10.754
I think we're fine.
We need some time with the menu.

16:10.920 --> 16:13.310
No worries.
Be right back with some water.

16:17.600 --> 16:19.432
So you here to confess?

16:26.440 --> 16:28.909
There's nothing to confess.

16:29.800 --> 16:32.156
We're here to talk about Walter, Jr.

16:32.320 --> 16:34.994
Flynn and Holly should be
living with us. End of story.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.914
And while
we respect your opinion,

16:38.800 --> 16:41.269
we think that your concern
is misplaced.

16:41.840 --> 16:46.471
Skyler and I feel,
due to Marie's attempt

16:46.640 --> 16:48.279
to lure him to your house...

16:48.480 --> 16:51.678
I wasn't trying to lure him.

16:51.840 --> 16:54.958
Regardless
of what you might call it,

16:55.120 --> 16:58.909
Skyler and I
would like to ask you

16:59.120 --> 17:03.353
to please leave
our children out of this.

17:03.520 --> 17:07.434
Junior has been through
a lot already this year.

17:08.359 --> 17:09.714
You are just...

17:09.920 --> 17:12.037
This investigation, Hank,

17:12.200 --> 17:14.874
do you realize
what this will do to him?

17:15.040 --> 17:16.234
Hearing these things?

17:16.400 --> 17:19.598
He's gonna hear it when I kick in
your front door and arrest you.

17:26.000 --> 17:30.472
If that day ever comes,
so be it.

17:30.640 --> 17:34.031
You have no evidence
to support your claims.

17:34.240 --> 17:37.551
Why tear this family apart?

17:39.600 --> 17:42.672
So how about that guacamole?

17:44.720 --> 17:47.918
We make it right here
at the table.

17:52.640 --> 17:55.280
I'll just give you guys
a few more minutes.

17:58.600 --> 18:01.832
How can you sit there
and listen to this?

18:02.000 --> 18:04.674
All we want is for those kids
to be safe.

18:04.840 --> 18:07.150
You're putting them in danger,
keeping them under the same roof...

18:07.320 --> 18:09.152
They are safe, Marie.

18:09.320 --> 18:13.439
You yourself sent them out of the house.
And I brought them back.

18:13.600 --> 18:17.230
Look, whatever you think he did,

18:17.400 --> 18:19.960
this is not an ongoing situation.

18:20.160 --> 18:21.310
Skyler.
No.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.392
They need to understand.
It's in the past.

18:26.560 --> 18:29.837
It's over.
There is nothing to go after here.

18:30.040 --> 18:31.440
There's nothing to accomplish.

18:31.600 --> 18:33.239
How can we believe
anything you say?

18:33.400 --> 18:36.154
There's no telling
where the lies begin and end.

18:36.320 --> 18:38.710
That affair of yours,
did that even happen?

18:38.880 --> 18:42.920
Please. Look, Junior just found out
that my cancer is back.

18:43.440 --> 18:47.070
He's already facing the idea
of living without his father.

18:47.240 --> 18:50.631
To put this on top of that?

18:52.600 --> 18:53.920
It's just not right.

18:54.080 --> 18:56.800
I swear to God,
you start throwing the word "right" at me...

18:56.960 --> 18:59.270
What I mean...
Was it right to run a drug empire?

18:59.440 --> 19:01.318
There is no drug empire.

19:01.480 --> 19:03.119
Lying to your son,
to all of us, is that right?

19:03.280 --> 19:05.397
What do I have to do
to make you believe me?

19:05.560 --> 19:07.517
Why don't you kill yourself,
Walt?

19:09.120 --> 19:11.157
- What?
- Just kill yourself.

19:11.320 --> 19:14.233
This whole thing dies with you.
That's what you're saying here?

19:14.400 --> 19:19.236
Is that Hank should just let it go
and wait for you to die.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.795
Well, maybe you should just
go ahead and die, then.

19:23.960 --> 19:29.194
That is not a solution.
No, it's not a solution.

19:29.880 --> 19:32.634
He's not getting off that easy.
Jesus, Hank.

19:32.800 --> 19:35.759
And the same goes for you
if you stick with him.

19:37.520 --> 19:40.354
Both of you think you're just gonna
walk away from this thing?

19:40.800 --> 19:42.393
Never gonna happen.

19:42.560 --> 19:45.951
That is not what we're saying.
Enough with the bullshit.

19:48.880 --> 19:51.714
You're not gonna negotiate
your way out of this thing.

19:51.880 --> 19:55.840
There's only one solution: Step up,
be a man and admit what you've done.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.151
That's it. There is no other option.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.718
Let's go.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.789
<i>My name is Walter Hartwell White.</i>

20:37.000 --> 20:39.640
<i>I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane,</i>

20:39.840 --> 20:43.470
<i>Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104.</i>

20:44.320 --> 20:46.391
<i>This is my confession.</i>

20:46.840 --> 20:48.991
<i>If you're watching this tape,</i>

20:49.600 --> 20:51.353
<i>I'm probably dead,</i>

20:51.920 --> 20:55.357
<i>murdered by my brother-in-law,
Hank Schrader.</i>

20:56.440 --> 20:59.194
<i>Hank has been building
a meth empire</i>

20:59.400 --> 21:03.155
<i>for over a year now
and using me as his chemist.</i>

21:03.360 --> 21:06.034
<i>Shortly after my 50th birthday,</i>

21:06.240 --> 21:08.550
<i>he asked that I use
my chemistry knowledge</i>

21:08.720 --> 21:12.873
<i>to cook methamphetamine,
which he would then sell</i>

21:13.080 --> 21:17.950
<i>using connections that he made
through his career with the DEA.</i>

21:18.720 --> 21:23.158
<i>I was astounded. I...</i>

21:23.320 --> 21:26.757
<i>I always thought Hank
was a very moral man</i>

21:26.920 --> 21:29.958
<i>and I was particularly
vulnerable at the time,</i>

21:30.120 --> 21:31.679
<i>something he knew</i>

21:31.840 --> 21:33.991
<i>and took advantage of.</i>

21:35.120 --> 21:37.760
<i>I was reeling
from a cancer diagnosis</i>

21:37.920 --> 21:41.630
<i>that was poised
to bankrupt my family.</i>

21:41.800 --> 21:44.793
<i>Hank took me on a ride-along
and showed me just how much money</i>

21:44.960 --> 21:47.794
<i>even a small meth operation
could make.</i>

21:48.360 --> 21:50.158
<i>And I was weak.</i>

21:51.000 --> 21:55.552
<i>I didn't want my family
to go into financial ruin,</i>

21:55.720 --> 21:57.313
<i>so I agreed.</i>

21:57.680 --> 22:01.959
<i>Hank had a partner, a businessman
named Gustavo Fring.</i>

22:02.120 --> 22:05.238
<i>Hank sold me into servitude
to this man,</i>

22:05.440 --> 22:08.797
<i>and when I tried to quit,
Fring threatened my family.</i>

22:08.960 --> 22:10.952
<i>I didn't know where to turn.</i>

22:12.440 --> 22:16.070
<i>Eventually, Hank and Fring
had a falling out</i>

22:16.240 --> 22:18.277
<i>and things escalated.</i>

22:18.480 --> 22:22.235
<i>Fring was able to arrange...</i>

22:22.720 --> 22:26.509
<i>Uh, I guess...
I guess you call it a hit on Hank.</i>

22:26.680 --> 22:29.593
<i>It failed,
but Hank was seriously injured</i>

22:29.760 --> 22:32.036
<i>and I wound up
paying his medical bills,</i>

22:32.240 --> 22:36.314
<i>which amounted
to a little over $177,000.</i>

22:36.480 --> 22:40.713
<i>Upon recovery,
Hank was bent on revenge.</i>

22:41.560 --> 22:45.793
<i>Working with a man
named Hector Salamanca,</i>

22:45.960 --> 22:47.872
<i>he plotted to kill Fring.</i>

22:48.040 --> 22:51.829
<i>The bomb that he used
was built by me.</i>

22:53.240 --> 22:55.800
<i>He gave me no option in that.</i>

22:56.520 --> 22:59.877
<i>I have often contemplated suicide,</i>

23:00.040 --> 23:02.271
<i>but I'm a coward.</i>

23:04.680 --> 23:07.070
<i>I wanted to go to the police...</i>

23:08.600 --> 23:10.239
<i>but I was frightened.</i>

23:10.680 --> 23:15.197
<i>Hank had risen to become the head
of the Albuquerque DEA.</i>

23:15.360 --> 23:18.592
<i>To keep me in line,
he took my children.</i>

23:18.760 --> 23:21.400
<i>For three months he kept them.</i>

23:23.240 --> 23:28.076
<i>My wife had no idea
of my criminal activities,</i>

23:28.240 --> 23:31.153
<i>was horrified to learn
what I had done.</i>

23:34.080 --> 23:35.878
<i>I was in hell.</i>

23:36.600 --> 23:40.310
<i>I hated myself for what
I had brought upon my family.</i>

23:42.520 --> 23:45.911
<i>Recently, I tried once again to quit,</i>

23:46.080 --> 23:50.154
<i>and in response, he gave me this.</i>

23:59.640 --> 24:01.871
<i>I can't take this anymore.</i>

24:03.360 --> 24:07.240
<i>I live in fear every day
that Hank will kill me</i>

24:08.680 --> 24:11.514
<i>or worse, hurt my family.</i>

24:14.680 --> 24:19.038
<i>All I could think to do
was to make this video</i>

24:19.200 --> 24:24.673
<i>and hope that the world
will finally see this man</i>

24:25.560 --> 24:27.631
<i>for what he really is.</i>

24:38.640 --> 24:40.472
Who do you think
he's shown this to?

24:42.560 --> 24:45.553
No one. It's a threat.

24:47.640 --> 24:50.439
It's what he will do
if I don't back off.

24:51.120 --> 24:53.237
I think you should
show this to Ramey.

24:53.400 --> 24:55.471
Just get ahead of it.

24:55.680 --> 24:59.469
That video is a bunch of lies, Hank.
Anybody who knows you will know.

24:59.680 --> 25:02.878
A hundred and seventy-seven
thousand dollars?

25:06.840 --> 25:08.752
Hell is he talking about?

25:13.600 --> 25:15.239
Marie?

25:18.240 --> 25:21.119
They told me
it was gambling money.

25:23.200 --> 25:25.556
What was gambling money?

25:28.920 --> 25:32.357
Oh, Jesus Christ, Marie.

25:32.520 --> 25:35.115
Oh, God, no.
How was I supposed to know?

25:35.280 --> 25:37.158
How was I to know
where it came from?

25:37.320 --> 25:40.279
Why were they paying for my bills?
What about my insurance?

25:40.440 --> 25:44.354
Insurance wouldn't have covered
the treatment you needed, and I...

25:44.680 --> 25:47.115
I wanted the best for you.
Why didn't you tell me?

25:47.280 --> 25:49.590
Because I knew that
you would refuse it

25:49.760 --> 25:52.992
and without it, you may never
have been able to walk again.

25:53.160 --> 25:54.753
Oh, Christ, Marie.

25:58.920 --> 26:00.752
You killed me here.

26:01.360 --> 26:03.955
I mean, it's the... It's the last nail.

26:04.200 --> 26:06.590
That's the last nail in the coffin.

26:09.680 --> 26:11.672
What do we do?

26:32.560 --> 26:35.280
If I were you,
I'd be more nervous.

26:36.560 --> 26:38.597
Ugh. Jesus.

26:38.760 --> 26:40.274
It's always the desert.

27:38.920 --> 27:40.274
Uh, I already checked it.

27:40.440 --> 27:43.399
It's clean. I wouldn't have
driven it here if it wasn't.

27:44.440 --> 27:46.750
Get one of these,
by the way.

27:46.920 --> 27:50.118
Reads radio signals.
Much easier.

27:56.480 --> 27:57.880
What does he know?

28:00.120 --> 28:02.794
I mean, he knows you're Heisenberg.

28:02.960 --> 28:04.952
But I figure not much else,

28:05.160 --> 28:07.277
otherwise, you know,
you'd be locked up.

28:09.840 --> 28:12.150
What did he say exactly?

28:13.160 --> 28:16.471
He wants me
to inform on you for him.

28:16.640 --> 28:18.632
Tell him everything we did.

28:20.840 --> 28:21.990
Anything else?

28:24.040 --> 28:27.636
I don't think he's told
the rest of the DEA.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.079
Why do you say that?

28:30.240 --> 28:32.994
Just him being there all by himself

28:33.160 --> 28:36.756
and, plus,
he was acting kind of shady.

28:36.920 --> 28:39.435
Seemed like
he didn't want the other cops

28:39.600 --> 28:42.274
hearing what he had to say.
Mm.

28:42.440 --> 28:46.275
Are we gonna talk about the rain of caca
the kid brought down upon us?

28:46.440 --> 28:49.274
Want to hazard a guess
what his little charity drive cost you?

28:49.440 --> 28:51.511
Why don't you go
take a walk, Saul?

29:01.520 --> 29:04.354
Jesse, will you let me help you?

29:05.480 --> 29:08.393
I don't like to see you
hurting like this.

29:11.360 --> 29:13.636
Maybe it's time for a change.

29:16.440 --> 29:17.999
What kind of change?

29:19.600 --> 29:21.273
I don't know.

29:25.240 --> 29:27.675
I don't know, maybe...

29:28.960 --> 29:31.634
Maybe it's time
for you to just

29:32.320 --> 29:34.960
leave all of this behind.

29:36.160 --> 29:37.879
Just get out of town.

29:38.040 --> 29:39.838
Don't look back.

29:45.880 --> 29:47.951
Saul knows a man.

29:49.760 --> 29:54.357
He specializes in giving people
new identities.

29:55.600 --> 29:59.150
He would move you
someplace far away

29:59.320 --> 30:02.154
and set you up
with a whole new life.

30:03.720 --> 30:08.272
Yeah, I know,
sounds a little extreme.

30:11.520 --> 30:14.592
But maybe it's exactly
what you need.

30:16.040 --> 30:18.839
You know, I really think
that would be good for you.

30:19.040 --> 30:20.759
A clean slate.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.589
All right, just think about it.

30:24.800 --> 30:29.272
You get a job, something
legitimate, something you like.

30:30.520 --> 30:32.796
Meet a girl,
start a family, even.

30:32.960 --> 30:36.317
Hell, you're still
so damn young. Heh.

30:37.480 --> 30:40.314
And what's here
for you now anyway?

30:44.040 --> 30:47.716
I tell you, if I could,
I'd trade places.

30:48.280 --> 30:50.158
A whole lifetime
ahead of you

30:50.320 --> 30:53.233
with a chance to hit
the reset button.

30:54.680 --> 30:56.717
In a few years,

30:57.680 --> 31:01.993
this might all feel like
nothing more than a bad dream.

31:14.720 --> 31:16.951
Would you just, for once,

31:17.120 --> 31:19.396
stop working me?

31:20.640 --> 31:22.279
What are you talking about?

31:22.480 --> 31:27.032
Can you just stop working me for, like,
10 seconds straight?

31:27.200 --> 31:29.351
Huh? Stop jerking me around?

31:29.960 --> 31:32.429
Jesse, I am not working you.

31:32.600 --> 31:35.991
Yes. Yes, you are.

31:36.200 --> 31:39.079
All right, just drop the whole
concerned-dad thing

31:39.240 --> 31:41.471
and tell me the truth.

31:41.640 --> 31:44.075
I mean, you're acting like

31:44.240 --> 31:46.709
me leaving town
is all about me

31:46.920 --> 31:52.473
and turning over a new leaf,
but it's really... It's really about you.

31:52.920 --> 31:54.718
I mean, you need me gone

31:54.880 --> 31:58.874
because your dickhead brother-in-law
is never gonna let up.

31:59.040 --> 32:00.997
Just say so.

32:01.160 --> 32:03.720
Just ask me for a favor.

32:05.080 --> 32:07.470
Just tell me you don't
give a shit about me

32:07.640 --> 32:09.393
and it's either this...

32:10.600 --> 32:15.550
It's either this or you'll kill me
the same way you killed Mike.

32:16.800 --> 32:19.759
I mean, isn't that
what this is all about?

32:20.920 --> 32:24.231
Us meeting
way the hell out here.

32:25.960 --> 32:28.520
In case I say no.

32:31.760 --> 32:33.513
Come on.

32:34.800 --> 32:37.634
Just tell me you need this.

33:34.760 --> 33:36.194
Your change.

33:36.360 --> 33:38.716
If you'll hand this
to your car wash professional

33:38.880 --> 33:40.951
and have an A-1 day.

33:48.480 --> 33:49.994
Skyler?

33:55.040 --> 33:57.396
Skyler, I've got my chemo
in about 45 minutes.

33:57.560 --> 34:00.473
Can you take over
the register for me?

34:03.080 --> 34:04.673
Skyler?

34:12.480 --> 34:14.277
It worked

34:15.040 --> 34:17.190
and we're fine.

34:18.920 --> 34:20.717
Okay?

34:22.760 --> 34:24.478
We're fine.

34:59.720 --> 35:01.074
So Palmer and Castanares

35:01.280 --> 35:03.749
are sitting on that jerkoff
Saul Goodman's office,

35:03.920 --> 35:06.754
keeping an eye on Jesse Pinkman.
Yeah, I put them on it.

35:06.920 --> 35:08.832
You wanna explain that
to me?

35:09.800 --> 35:12.156
Yeah. Right.

35:12.320 --> 35:15.996
Why the hell should I know anything?
They're just my guys, after all.

35:16.680 --> 35:18.459
You gotta tell me what's going on.

35:18.559 --> 35:20.594
Pinkman is A.P.D.'s problem, not ours.

35:20.800 --> 35:22.314
You got a history with this kid.

35:22.480 --> 35:24.597
If he catches wind
that you're trailing him

35:24.760 --> 35:26.672
and this explodes,
he could sue.

35:27.680 --> 35:31.959
Look, if I can't explain this
to Ramey, I gotta pull my guys.

35:32.880 --> 35:34.439
Fine. Take them off.

35:37.600 --> 35:40.513
I said, take them off.
What else you want?

35:58.040 --> 35:59.759
I'm going out for a while.

36:00.400 --> 36:02.153
You have that 3:00.

36:02.320 --> 36:03.993
Will you be back?

36:04.160 --> 36:07.710
You know what, it's gonna have
to be another day. Reschedule it.

36:11.080 --> 36:12.205
Last chance.

36:12.305 --> 36:14.073
You sure there's nobody
you wanna say bye to?

36:14.240 --> 36:16.038
Nobody at all?

36:16.200 --> 36:17.714
No.

36:17.880 --> 36:21.635
This is it. Once I make the call,
there's no take-backs.

36:28.400 --> 36:29.800
Uh, I need a new dust filter

36:30.000 --> 36:33.391
for my Hoover Max Extract
Pressure Pro, model 60.

36:33.560 --> 36:35.791
Can you help me with that?

36:36.000 --> 36:37.150
Yeah, pickup.

36:37.320 --> 36:41.439
He's hot. Um, not "hot" hot,
just a little hot.

36:41.600 --> 36:45.514
Currently out on bail.
Yeah, he knows the rules.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.834
One hour.
Okay, he'll be there.

36:51.200 --> 36:52.839
And done.

36:56.280 --> 36:57.600
Okay,

36:57.760 --> 37:00.195
this guy's fee is 125.

37:00.400 --> 37:02.517
Your benefactor

37:02.680 --> 37:05.320
asked me to send you out
with something extra.

37:05.480 --> 37:06.914
Get you started, you know?

37:07.120 --> 37:08.873
Keep you sitting pretty

37:09.080 --> 37:11.879
until you get into the groove
of your new life.

37:12.080 --> 37:16.040
Provided, of course, you don't
toss it out the window on the way.

37:17.040 --> 37:20.112
Seriously, this is the last of it

37:20.280 --> 37:23.159
so you might wanna think
about making a budget.

37:23.320 --> 37:24.720
Hey, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

37:24.880 --> 37:27.679
You can't fire up a doob
in here. Put that out.

37:27.840 --> 37:29.752
I mean it. Put it out.

37:29.920 --> 37:33.152
Look, Mr. Natural, I'm not
gonna let you sabotage this thing.

37:33.320 --> 37:36.358
This guy is not gonna take you
if you show up high,

37:36.560 --> 37:39.917
so stop screwing around,
or it's both our asses.

37:44.000 --> 37:47.676
Right. Well, that's a start.
Now, give with the dope.

38:02.400 --> 38:03.754
Christ.

38:03.920 --> 38:07.072
Some people are immune
to good advice.

38:08.360 --> 38:10.079
I'm gonna get a bag
for this cash.

38:10.240 --> 38:13.392
Don't even think
about lighting up again.

38:14.920 --> 38:17.958
Francesca,
we got any bags?

38:18.120 --> 38:20.840
For money.
Money-sized bags.

38:25.800 --> 38:27.757
Huell will drop you
at the pickup spot,

38:27.920 --> 38:30.037
then he's gonna get
the hell out of there.

38:30.400 --> 38:31.834
You got that?

38:32.000 --> 38:34.993
Guy won't pick up the kid
if he's got company.

38:35.480 --> 38:37.073
You got a phone?

38:37.440 --> 38:38.840
Cops took it.

38:41.360 --> 38:43.397
All right, in case
something goes wrong,

38:43.560 --> 38:46.792
guy doesn't show, whatever,
you give me a call.

38:50.040 --> 38:53.158
Seriously? Hello Kitty?

38:53.320 --> 38:54.834
Seriously, it's free.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.437
We got a beggars-choosers situation
here, so stop busting my balls.

38:58.600 --> 39:00.159
Corner of Juan Tabo and Osuna.

39:00.320 --> 39:04.030
You, you're gonna sit and wait.
This guy's punctual with a capital P.

39:04.200 --> 39:07.079
Okay? So don't move.
Don't get up and get an ice cream.

39:07.280 --> 39:10.432
Just stay put like a good boy.
He'll pick you up, you pay him.

39:10.600 --> 39:12.831
He'll take your ID,
he'll give you a new one.

39:13.000 --> 39:17.279
Goodbye, Jesse Pinkman.
Hello, Mr. Credit to Society.

39:18.280 --> 39:19.873
So do I get to pick where I go?

39:20.080 --> 39:22.356
Well, it's your life.
I imagine you get a say.

39:22.520 --> 39:24.477
Want a suggestion?
How about Florida?

39:24.640 --> 39:27.439
You get a tan,
meet the Swedish bikini team,

39:27.600 --> 39:29.319
you know,
swim with the dolphins.

39:29.480 --> 39:32.154
What about Alaska?

39:32.320 --> 39:35.279
Alaska. Okay, well,
that's a different vibe.

39:35.440 --> 39:37.636
I never figured you
for a moose lover,

39:37.800 --> 39:40.315
but whatever floats your boat.
Alaska.

39:41.040 --> 39:42.394
Alaska's good.

39:43.440 --> 39:46.000
Anywhere you can get
a fresh start is gonna be good.

39:46.160 --> 39:47.514
You ready?

39:47.680 --> 39:49.478
Yeah.

39:51.280 --> 39:53.476
Take care, Jesse.

39:54.880 --> 39:56.917
All right.

40:03.200 --> 40:04.680
Excuse me.

41:51.320 --> 41:53.277
Hey, man, you can't go in there!

41:54.600 --> 41:56.557
He a no-show?
Why didn't you call?

41:57.160 --> 41:58.150
Why didn't you...?

42:00.040 --> 42:01.315
Stop! Unh!

42:02.440 --> 42:03.590
Code red!

42:06.680 --> 42:08.956
Huell!
No! Hey!

42:09.120 --> 42:10.395
Hey!
Get in here!

42:13.680 --> 42:15.194
Back off!

42:15.360 --> 42:16.999
You, stay where you are.

42:17.600 --> 42:20.035
What? I don't know what
happened here. What did I do?

42:20.200 --> 42:21.839
You stole it off me.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.515
You and him, you took it
out of my pocket, didn't you?

42:24.680 --> 42:26.639
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Calm down.
Yes. Okay.

42:26.839 --> 42:28.196
I had Huell lift your dope.

42:28.360 --> 42:30.795
I told you I couldn't risk
the guy not taking you.

42:30.960 --> 42:34.510
No! Before. The cigarette.

42:34.680 --> 42:37.320
You stole the cigarette.

42:37.480 --> 42:40.359
What?
The ricin cigarette!

42:40.520 --> 42:42.830
You had him steal it off of me!

42:43.000 --> 42:45.435
And all for that asshole
Mr. White!

42:45.600 --> 42:47.751
He poisoned Brock!

42:47.960 --> 42:51.636
He poisoned Brock, and you...
You helped him!

42:51.800 --> 42:54.918
Okay, Jesse, calm down.
Say it again!

42:55.080 --> 42:57.515
Tell me one more time
to calm down! Come on!

42:57.720 --> 42:59.552
I'm sorry. Yes. Okay.

42:59.760 --> 43:02.320
I had Huell lift your cigarette,
but Walt made me.

43:02.480 --> 43:05.552
He told me he was helping you,
he was saving you.

43:05.720 --> 43:08.679
I never would've agreed to it
if I'd known what he was gonna do.

43:08.840 --> 43:12.516
Jesse, you gotta believe me.
I didn't want any of this!

43:22.840 --> 43:24.559
Back up!

43:32.400 --> 43:35.154
Get off me!
What do I pay you for?

43:38.120 --> 43:41.318
Hey, it's me. We got a big problem.

43:41.480 --> 43:43.995
...eighteen, 19 and 20.

43:44.160 --> 43:46.755
Actually, you gave me a 5,
not a 1.

43:46.920 --> 43:49.799
Oh, I... I did. I'm... I'm so sorry.

43:49.960 --> 43:53.032
Um, here you go.

43:53.200 --> 43:54.759
Thank you for your honesty.

43:54.920 --> 43:58.152
Oh, and please give this
to your car wash professional.

43:58.360 --> 44:00.397
Have an A-1 day.

44:02.680 --> 44:04.194
God.

44:08.840 --> 44:10.240
Hey.
Hi.

44:10.400 --> 44:13.598
What's going on?
Not much.

44:17.440 --> 44:19.750
Yeah? Nothing?
Nope. Things are fine.

44:19.920 --> 44:21.832
Good.
Why?

44:22.000 --> 44:24.834
Oh, no reason.

44:32.880 --> 44:36.271
You know what I found the other day

44:36.480 --> 44:41.430
is that the... The... The latch
on the soda machine wasn't...

44:43.440 --> 44:45.193
latching.

44:45.360 --> 44:49.559
It's... It's catching every time
that I stock that darn thing.

44:51.480 --> 44:53.995
So I thought I'd check it out.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.434
Great.

45:28.480 --> 45:29.800
Thank you.

45:32.600 --> 45:36.833
Oh. Exact change. I like that.
Thank you very much.

45:39.200 --> 45:40.600
Okay.

45:41.240 --> 45:42.959
And...

45:43.520 --> 45:46.592
please give this
to your car-care professional

45:46.800 --> 45:49.315
and have an A-1 day. Thank you.
Thank you.

45:49.480 --> 45:52.279
I just remembered
they gave me a prescription

45:52.440 --> 45:55.353
to go pick up, so... I forgot.
I'm gonna go

45:55.560 --> 45:58.439
head on over
to the drugstore, okay?

45:58.600 --> 46:00.796
Yeah, okay.
All right.
