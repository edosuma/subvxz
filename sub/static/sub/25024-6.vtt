[roars]

00:55.180 --> 00:56.014
Mm.

01:07.609 --> 01:08.943
[Barbara] Jim.

01:09.611 --> 01:10.445
[gasps]

01:14.532 --> 01:16.284
[grunting]

01:16.367 --> 01:18.119
-Get out of here.
-[screams]

01:18.203 --> 01:21.372
-We have to get to the hospital.
-Can't. [coughs]

01:21.456 --> 01:23.750
-Our wounds won't be healed by...
-[shrieks]

01:23.833 --> 01:26.419
-[groans]
-You're going to be okay, Barbara.

01:26.503 --> 01:27.504
[grunts]

01:27.587 --> 01:30.423
You were always my hero.

01:31.299 --> 01:33.551
My beautiful boy.

01:33.635 --> 01:37.472
[Jim] For the Glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command.

01:39.182 --> 01:40.308
[gasps]

01:42.393 --> 01:44.145
Oh, no.

01:44.729 --> 01:45.563
Jim.

01:47.273 --> 01:49.901
Whoo. C-minus. [shudders]

01:50.652 --> 01:55.907
-C-plus. What did you get, Jim?
-D, and probably summer school.

01:55.990 --> 01:58.201
SeÃ±or Uhl said
that next week's Spanish final

01:58.284 --> 02:00.370
counts for 20 percent of our grade.

02:00.453 --> 02:02.497
-If you ace that...
-[Toby] Yeah, Jimbo.

02:02.580 --> 02:05.125
Twenty percent is the difference
between life and death.

02:05.208 --> 02:06.668
I mean, academically speaking.

02:06.751 --> 02:09.670
Yeah, let's bring our books to training.
Cramming couldn't hurt.

02:10.713 --> 02:12.674
Mom, are you home?

02:12.757 --> 02:14.134
[Barbara] In here, kids.

02:17.095 --> 02:19.764
-Oh, hello.
-[both chuckle]

02:19.848 --> 02:21.266
We need to talk.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.644
Those four words are never good.

02:24.727 --> 02:26.646
[bottles clanking]

02:28.314 --> 02:30.024
-Ooh.
-[can rattles]

02:30.108 --> 02:32.193
Who's there? I'm armed.

02:32.777 --> 02:38.241
I beg of you, please,
you must take me to my brother.

02:38.324 --> 02:41.536
I don't know your brother
and I don't know you. Now shoo!

02:41.619 --> 02:42.537
Please!

02:42.620 --> 02:44.664
Oh! No. [gasps]

02:44.747 --> 02:47.625
-Take me to Blinkous Galadrigal.
-No, no. No, no.

02:47.709 --> 02:51.421
-The fate of the world depends on it.
-Oh!

-Ugh!

03:19.032 --> 03:20.116
[hisses]

03:26.664 --> 03:27.624
[growls]

03:27.707 --> 03:29.083
Ugh!

03:29.167 --> 03:31.794
Which one of you things is in charge?

03:32.378 --> 03:34.047
Hmm. [grunts]

03:42.055 --> 03:43.973
Do you know who I am?

03:44.057 --> 03:45.391
[beeping]

03:45.475 --> 03:48.686
-[computerized voice] Q is for Queen.
-[groans softly]

03:48.770 --> 03:52.649
-Clever.
-Yes. [growls]

03:52.732 --> 03:53.733
[sighs]

03:54.400 --> 04:00.365
I need you and your friends to track down
a troll named Dictatious Galadrigal...

04:00.448 --> 04:01.991
-and kill him.
-[growls]

04:02.075 --> 04:03.284
[Queen Usurna] Understood?

04:03.952 --> 04:06.579
[computerized voice]
D is for Dog. Woof, woof!

04:06.663 --> 04:09.165
-Y is for Yes.
-Yes.

04:09.249 --> 04:12.210
-[Mrs. Nunez] Barbara, what's going on?
-[Mr. Nunez] This is bad.

04:12.293 --> 04:15.004
[Mrs. Nunez] You said
our children's lives were in trouble.

04:15.088 --> 04:19.050
My Toby-Pie would never be in trouble.
He's an angel.

04:19.132 --> 04:20.385
Actually, Mrs. Domzalski,

04:20.468 --> 04:24.347
I'm afraid they're in serious danger,
but it'd be best if they explain.

04:24.847 --> 04:26.057
-Kids?
-[all chuckle]

04:28.309 --> 04:29.143
[Claire] Uh...

04:29.227 --> 04:31.729
-I don't know what she's talking about.
-Neither do I.

04:31.813 --> 04:35.650
-Jimbo, maybe you could help us out.
-Um...

04:37.568 --> 04:38.403
Uh...

04:41.197 --> 04:43.032
It's the drugs, isn't it?

04:43.116 --> 04:45.952
It's not drugs, it's trolls.

04:46.035 --> 04:47.036
[all gasp]

04:48.329 --> 04:50.248
The Internet! I knew it.

04:50.331 --> 04:52.834
Not Internet trolls, real trolls.

04:54.335 --> 04:55.670
[laughter]

04:58.423 --> 05:00.049
[all chuckle]

05:01.509 --> 05:04.178
Trolls? Barbara.

05:04.262 --> 05:05.388
[sips]

05:05.471 --> 05:07.515
-Are you on the drugs?
-[Barbara] No.

05:07.598 --> 05:10.101
There are these creatures
that live beneath us.

05:10.184 --> 05:12.145
It's not entirely clear in my head,

05:12.228 --> 05:15.231
but our kids are helping them
and fighting them.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.026
Oh, no.
[whispers] It is the drugs.

05:18.609 --> 05:20.611
-I believe you, Barbara.
-You do?

05:20.695 --> 05:22.864
I, too, have dealt with stress and anxiety

05:22.947 --> 05:25.033
and have the number
to an excellent therapist.

05:25.116 --> 05:26.284
It's not stress, Ophelia.

05:26.367 --> 05:31.831
[laughs] Trolls living beneath us? What?
That's crazy town banana pants fosters.

05:31.914 --> 05:34.125
[laughs] With extra nuts.

05:34.208 --> 05:36.461
Jim, tell them. Please.

05:37.712 --> 05:38.546
Uh...

05:41.632 --> 05:42.467
Um...

05:43.134 --> 05:43.968
Uh...

05:45.970 --> 05:47.305
[sighs]

05:47.388 --> 05:50.183
The hospital asked her
to take some time off.

05:50.266 --> 05:51.851
-Oh, no.
-Oh, dear.

05:52.560 --> 05:53.394
What?

05:55.354 --> 05:57.315
-Look in their bags. Search them.
-What?

05:57.398 --> 05:59.275
I'm sure you'll find a few surprises.

06:00.818 --> 06:01.819
Mom.

06:02.403 --> 06:04.197
That's an invasion of my privacy.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.114
Nana, don't.

06:06.449 --> 06:07.909
Oh, my.

06:07.992 --> 06:10.703
I don't know what's going on,
but what do you call this?

06:11.871 --> 06:13.372
That's a protractor, Dad.

06:13.456 --> 06:15.374
[Mrs. Nunez] I think she meant this.

06:16.000 --> 06:16.834
Uh...

06:16.918 --> 06:20.505
Isn't it clear? Your son stole
these artifacts from the museum.

06:20.588 --> 06:22.757
-It was in your daughter's bag.
-How dare you?

06:22.840 --> 06:23.841
Excuse me?

06:23.925 --> 06:26.010
The police arrested your son, remember?

06:26.094 --> 06:27.720
-Psst.
-[Mrs. Nunez] How dare you?

06:27.804 --> 06:30.056
-Master Jim.
-[Nana] ...breaking and entering?

06:30.139 --> 06:33.226
-My daughter is-- Since she has met him.
-Cookies.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.144
-We confess.
-What?

06:35.228 --> 06:39.690
We confess. We're... LARPers.

06:39.774 --> 06:45.196
We're LARPers. Live Action Role Players.
We play a fantasy game during lunchtime.

06:45.279 --> 06:49.283
Yeah. [chuckles]
She's a sorceress, that's her wand.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.994
And I'm a war king.

06:52.078 --> 06:55.164
That's a thing, right?
And Jim has a metal...

06:55.248 --> 06:57.250
He's a metalizer.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.335
-It's worse than we thought.
-[scoffs]

06:59.418 --> 07:02.421
They're lying. This is not make-believe.

07:02.505 --> 07:03.798
I think I saw this in...

07:03.881 --> 07:06.050
Blinky, what are you doing here?

07:06.134 --> 07:08.302
Forgive me for using the tunnel,
it is urgent.

07:08.386 --> 07:10.680
This is neither the time
nor the place, Blink.

07:10.763 --> 07:13.474
If you don't listen to me,
there will be no time or place.

07:13.558 --> 07:15.768
We know the reason
for Aaarrgghh!!!'s absence,

07:15.852 --> 07:19.021
though I'm still unsure
if I should trust its source.

07:19.105 --> 07:19.939
[throat clearing]

07:21.607 --> 07:23.943
-Allow me, brother.
-Dictatious?

07:24.026 --> 07:28.656
Gunmar has taken Aaarrgghh!!! captive
and is en route to resurrect Angor Rot.

07:28.739 --> 07:31.492
That's... That's impossible.
We smashed him.

07:31.576 --> 07:35.163
There is but one being
with the power to resurrect him.

07:35.246 --> 07:38.875
I fear we already know her name. Morgana.

07:40.960 --> 07:44.839
Why do you believe him?
He's Gunmar's stooge. It could be a trick.

07:44.922 --> 07:48.092
I thought so myself,
thus the timber-hitch quadruple knot.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.053
But if what he speaks of is true--

07:51.137 --> 07:51.971
[Barbara] Jim?

07:52.054 --> 07:52.972
Hide.

07:53.055 --> 07:54.974
-Yeah. Okay.
-Let me get--

07:56.851 --> 07:59.312
-[thuds]
-[grunts] Speak of the devil.

08:01.397 --> 08:03.441
-Jim, are you hiding down here?
-No.

08:04.025 --> 08:07.445
Uh... I was looking at your paintings.

08:07.528 --> 08:11.574
-You have quite an imagination.
-Don't you walk away from me.

08:11.657 --> 08:13.576
You made me look crazy up there.

08:14.827 --> 08:17.872
Do all Troll Knights
let their mothers be humiliated?

08:26.422 --> 08:28.841
Trollhunter, Mom.

08:29.425 --> 08:30.760
I'm the Trollhunter.

08:32.970 --> 08:34.679
I know we've had this conversation.

08:34.764 --> 08:38.976
-I didn't wanna drag you into this again.
-So instead you dragged your friends?

08:39.059 --> 08:43.022
[sighs] We're parents. It's our duty
to know if our children are in trouble.

08:43.105 --> 08:47.401
Trouble? This isn't trouble.
This is real danger.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.362
Genuine life-threatening stuff.

08:49.445 --> 08:51.030
I almost lost you.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.742
But you also saved my life.

08:54.825 --> 08:58.579
That much I do remember correctly. [sighs]

08:58.663 --> 09:02.875
Jim, listen. I'm a doctor.
I know saving lives isn't easy work.

09:02.959 --> 09:05.836
I'm not trying to stop you.
I'm trying to help you.

09:05.920 --> 09:09.632
But with danger this close to home,
their parents should know.

09:09.715 --> 09:11.300
-[Blinky] Hello.
-[gasps]

09:11.384 --> 09:14.262
-Barbara.
-[screams]

09:15.388 --> 09:18.307
Oh, I knew it! That's Mr. Blinky.

09:18.391 --> 09:19.600
Blink-heh.

09:20.768 --> 09:22.979
[grunts] I can't see.

09:23.062 --> 09:26.440
Is this a joyous occasion,
or a terrifying--?

09:26.524 --> 09:28.734
I don't remember this one.

09:28.818 --> 09:33.155
I wanted to tell the truth, but what if
their parents don't understand?

09:33.239 --> 09:37.618
If they get in the way, my friends,
human and troll, could die.

09:37.702 --> 09:40.413
And if there comes a day
when your friends don't come home,

09:40.496 --> 09:42.873
what will you tell their parents then?

09:45.293 --> 09:50.006
Jim, we're here to support you,
no matter what the problem is.

09:50.506 --> 09:55.261
If it's school, if it's girls,
if it's... trolls.

09:55.344 --> 09:56.762
Especially trolls.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.266
But if we don't talk,
how are we supposed to help?

10:06.188 --> 10:10.860
-Oh, I see. It's a heartfelt occasion.
-Shut it, you blind bat.

10:10.943 --> 10:12.278
You're ruining the moment.

10:12.945 --> 10:14.947
[sniffing]

10:17.199 --> 10:19.035
[growls]

10:20.536 --> 10:22.913
[sniffs, whistles]

10:23.831 --> 10:25.833
[growling]

10:29.795 --> 10:32.506
How dare you accuse my Toby-Pie?

10:32.590 --> 10:34.175
Well, there's something going on.

10:34.258 --> 10:37.470
We used to have living room furniture,
and now we do not.

10:37.553 --> 10:39.263
I have something to say.

10:39.347 --> 10:41.432
What are we doing here, buddy?

10:41.515 --> 10:44.602
-We're not really gonna, you know...
-Doubling down on the LARPing?

10:44.685 --> 10:47.647
-I'm good if you are.
-We're doubling down on the truth.

10:47.730 --> 10:51.108
Our parents deserve to know
what we do at night.

10:51.192 --> 10:53.861
What do you do at night with my daughter?

10:53.944 --> 10:55.446
We fight trolls.

10:56.155 --> 10:56.989
[sighs]

10:57.907 --> 11:00.785
Well, at least that's better
than the alternative. [grunts]

11:00.868 --> 11:01.952
What?

11:02.036 --> 11:04.372
[Jim] Everything my mother said is true.

11:05.039 --> 11:09.752
I am-- I mean, we are Trollhunters.

11:10.586 --> 11:11.420
[chuckles]

11:12.797 --> 11:13.798
Ta-da.

11:15.383 --> 11:18.052
That's enough of this nonsense.
We are leaving.

11:18.636 --> 11:22.390
Kiddo, maybe you should show
rather than tell.

11:23.766 --> 11:26.394
Nana, you may wanna turn down
your hearing aid.

11:27.019 --> 11:28.938
And could you pass me that thingy?

11:29.355 --> 11:32.108
Here you go, War King. [chuckles]

11:36.946 --> 11:37.780
[all gasp]

11:40.658 --> 11:41.492
Hmm.

11:42.326 --> 11:45.454
Azazazuth-Kinekh-Thoon!

11:45.538 --> 11:46.705
[gasps]

11:47.915 --> 11:48.749
[grunts]

11:50.084 --> 11:51.585
[all gasp]

11:53.295 --> 11:57.758
For the glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command.

12:11.897 --> 12:14.275
[chuckles] Still better
than the alternative.

12:16.735 --> 12:20.364
-Uh... [chuckles]
-So, who wants coffee?

12:21.031 --> 12:23.742
-Brother, what are they saying?
-Shush. Silence.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.202
Do not shush me.

12:25.286 --> 12:27.913
I may not see, but I have a right to know.

12:27.997 --> 12:31.250
I said "silence" as in they are not
speaking, you blundering ignoramus.

12:31.792 --> 12:34.920
[Dictatious]
Your litany of barbs is growing mundane.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.882
Might I recommend eating a thesaurus?

12:37.965 --> 12:39.383
No. [gasps]

12:40.801 --> 12:42.470
Treachery! [screams]

12:45.389 --> 12:46.640
[snarls, growls]

12:47.224 --> 12:48.058
Goblins!

12:53.731 --> 12:55.399
Why did I believe you?

12:55.483 --> 12:58.402
You led them to us,
you vile bait of death.

12:58.486 --> 13:02.072
I swear on my life,
I performed no such treachery.

13:02.156 --> 13:06.535
Usurna must've sent them here to kill me.
Please, cut me loose.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.580
I should cut out your tongue. Liar!

13:10.164 --> 13:12.500
Great Gorkus, it's an infestation.

13:14.126 --> 13:18.130
This is the most awesome thing
I have ever seen.

13:18.714 --> 13:23.010
-Oh! Can I get one?
-No, Javier. This is not awesome.

13:23.093 --> 13:27.223
Our daughter is 16. She can't even vote,
and she's supposed to protect the world?

13:27.306 --> 13:29.308
You don't even know what I can do, Mom.

13:29.934 --> 13:30.768
Uh...

13:30.851 --> 13:34.396
-Who are you calling?
-The mayor. I have him on speed dial.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.899
-Ophelia, you can't.
-Mom, what are you doing?

13:36.982 --> 13:39.735
Besides showing your age
with the phrase "speed dial"?

13:39.819 --> 13:41.821
Oh. What's a speed dial?

13:41.904 --> 13:45.407
If an apocalypse is brewing under my city,
it's my responsibility to stop it.

13:45.491 --> 13:48.619
-[goblins growling]
-[both grunting]

13:48.702 --> 13:50.454
[Mrs. Nunez screaming]

13:50.538 --> 13:53.082
-They're hideous.
-We could say the same of you.

13:53.958 --> 13:57.378
We love what you're doing, Mayor.
Keep up the good work. Thanks, bye.

13:57.461 --> 13:59.255
Mrs. Nunez, he's good.

13:59.338 --> 14:01.465
-The other one, not so much.
-Hey.

14:01.549 --> 14:05.010
Master Jim, apologies for interrupting,
but we have a little problem.

14:06.303 --> 14:08.764
[sniffing, growling]

14:08.847 --> 14:13.269
-Oh, geez. These guys are the worst.
-We gotta get our parents outta here.

14:14.979 --> 14:18.858
-[Mr. Nunez] Are those the trolls?
-They're not trolls, they're goblins.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.776
So many kitties.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.946
-[screams] Oh!
-Stand back, sweetie. I've got them.

14:25.364 --> 14:26.198
[grunts]

14:30.286 --> 14:33.289
Come here, little fella. Ow!

14:33.372 --> 14:36.959
Oh, you're a hungry fella.
Take the cookie.

14:37.543 --> 14:38.836
[grunting]

14:39.795 --> 14:42.047
Here, kitty kitty. Take the cookie.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.384
Oh, nice kitty.

14:45.467 --> 14:48.637
Nana, don't feed the goblins! [grunts]

14:49.430 --> 14:53.392
-Oh, what did you do to that kitty?
-Again, those aren't kitties, Nana.

14:53.475 --> 14:56.478
Also, we should probably talk
about our Japanese exchange student.

14:56.979 --> 14:59.565
Oh. Whatever happened to Arthur-San?

14:59.648 --> 15:02.526
Claire! What are you waiting for?
Portal them out of here!

15:06.405 --> 15:09.408
-Holy shish kebabs!
-We are not going in that thing.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.827
-[screams]
-[grunts]

15:11.911 --> 15:13.412
Well, we're not leaving you here.

15:17.541 --> 15:19.877
That's my girl. [grunts]

15:19.960 --> 15:23.339
-Nobody touches my little princess.
-Ay, PapÃ¡.

15:23.964 --> 15:25.257
[grunts]

15:26.759 --> 15:28.844
[Barbara]
Watch out! Behind you! That's it!

15:28.928 --> 15:30.846
Nice hit, kiddo!

15:30.930 --> 15:33.015
-Mom.
-Sorry, honey. Habit.

15:33.098 --> 15:35.142
-[screaming]
-[snarling]

15:35.726 --> 15:37.186
They're coming from outside.

15:37.269 --> 15:39.480
-We have to seal the windows.
-I'm on it.

15:44.068 --> 15:45.069
[grunts]

15:46.987 --> 15:47.988
[whimpering]

15:48.948 --> 15:50.240
Good kitties.

15:52.660 --> 15:53.494
Help!

15:57.831 --> 16:00.542
He brought them here!
I told you we couldn't trust him.

16:00.626 --> 16:05.547
I only brought valuable information.
They are trying to assassinate me.

16:05.631 --> 16:09.343
-Perhaps we should let that happen.
-Come on. We'll deal with him later.

16:09.426 --> 16:13.597
Brother? Brother? You have abandoned me.

16:13.681 --> 16:14.848
[screams]

16:16.183 --> 16:19.186
Blinkous, help me! Help!

16:19.645 --> 16:20.479
[grunts]

16:20.562 --> 16:24.024
This is because of my campaign, isn't it?
Not spending enough time with you.

16:24.108 --> 16:26.568
Everything doesn't revolve
around you, Mom.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.405
Dad, duck!

16:31.281 --> 16:33.659
Cheese and crackers. That's my girl.

16:33.742 --> 16:37.413
Why do you wanna fight goblins?
You wanted to be an actress.

16:37.496 --> 16:38.956
-[growls]
-[screams]

16:40.374 --> 16:41.667
[screams]

16:42.960 --> 16:47.631
Oh, dear. I'm almost out of cookies.
You hungry little beasties.

16:47.715 --> 16:48.966
Come on, Nana!

16:49.049 --> 16:52.970
Toby, I think these kitties
come from a rough neighborhood.

16:57.766 --> 16:58.767
No!

16:59.518 --> 17:04.272
-No... No, have mercy.
-[door opens]

17:11.530 --> 17:13.781
That's not a crossbow, is it?

17:15.075 --> 17:16.492
It is.

17:17.118 --> 17:18.037
[beeps]

17:18.119 --> 17:19.954
[computerized voice] K is for Kill.

17:20.372 --> 17:22.790
Don't know what they told you,
we can work this out.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.126
[gasps]

17:30.007 --> 17:31.425
Waka-chaka.

17:32.134 --> 17:33.927
Jim? A little help in the kitchen?

17:37.056 --> 17:38.515
[grunts]

17:48.067 --> 17:51.236
-They really are trying to kill you.
-Don't let them get me, Blinkous.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.655
I'm far too old to die.

17:56.200 --> 17:59.078
Come at me, you mangy rodents.

18:01.955 --> 18:04.041
[roaring]

18:04.124 --> 18:08.128
You saved my life.
I forgive you for blinding me, brother.

18:08.212 --> 18:11.757
-Forgive? You were trying to kill me.
-[glass shatters]

18:11.840 --> 18:14.093
That was circumstantial.

18:15.677 --> 18:16.929
Claire, watch out!

18:19.431 --> 18:20.724
-[screams]
-Oh!

18:21.475 --> 18:22.768
Where'd she go?

18:25.813 --> 18:27.439
[Claire screaming]

18:27.523 --> 18:29.858
[both grunt]

18:33.362 --> 18:34.822
[Morgana] Die!

18:34.905 --> 18:37.116
[Merlin] I banish you!

18:39.576 --> 18:42.538
Tell the Trollhunter I'm coming for him.

18:43.247 --> 18:44.331
[grunts]

18:47.084 --> 18:47.918
[gasps]

18:50.462 --> 18:51.588
[Barbara] Jim, I'm open!

18:51.672 --> 18:54.800
Waka-chaka. Waka...

18:56.802 --> 18:59.930
B is for Blender, furball.

19:00.013 --> 19:02.015
[whirring]

19:06.395 --> 19:09.148
[chuckles]
And you say I'm hopeless in the kitchen.

19:09.231 --> 19:10.274
[chuckles]

19:10.357 --> 19:12.234
[screaming]

19:12.317 --> 19:14.111
[Barbara] Not another step, vermin!

19:19.533 --> 19:20.534
Huh?

19:20.617 --> 19:22.119
-[gasps]
-[whirring]

19:22.202 --> 19:23.996
[all clamoring]

19:27.124 --> 19:32.087
Claire. What happened to my baby Claire?
Javier, get her back.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.213
This is bad.

19:33.297 --> 19:34.756
Bring her back to me.

19:36.341 --> 19:38.051
I forgive you again.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.971
Step back, please. A one-foot radius.

19:41.054 --> 19:44.683
-You saved my life. I must thank you.
-Back, back, back, I say.

19:44.766 --> 19:45.601
That's better.

19:45.684 --> 19:50.439
Javier, our baby is out there
with those trolls.

19:50.522 --> 19:51.773
Uh, goblins.

19:51.857 --> 19:54.568
You hear that, Nana? They get it. Goblins.

19:54.651 --> 19:57.154
Don't worry, darling.
We will get her back.

19:57.237 --> 20:00.532
-[Mrs. Nunez sniffling]
-She has her staff, right? She'll be okay?

20:05.078 --> 20:09.082
-Claire! Claire! Are you okay?
-I've been better.

20:10.959 --> 20:12.544
Oh. [chuckles]

20:12.628 --> 20:13.462
[sighs]

20:15.130 --> 20:17.799
May I hug you now, brother?

20:20.677 --> 20:23.263
Mom, you can't tell anyone.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.974
I'm an adult.
You don't tell me what to do.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.184
[Jim] Claire's right.

20:27.267 --> 20:28.894
You can't tell anyone.

20:28.977 --> 20:31.396
If anything stops us
from defeating Gunmar,

20:31.480 --> 20:34.524
it's not just us in danger, it's everyone.

20:34.608 --> 20:36.777
And Jimbo's the only one who can stop him.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.403
With our help.

20:38.487 --> 20:40.280
[line ringing]

20:40.364 --> 20:46.161
Listen, I believe in my child
and I need you to believe in yours.

20:46.245 --> 20:50.249
We have to protect them the way they are,
not the way we want them to be.

20:50.832 --> 20:53.085
We don't have ordinary kids.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.963
Listen, I know this sounds crazy.

20:56.046 --> 20:59.132
I know this goes against
every parental instinct.

20:59.758 --> 21:05.681
But we have to trust them, to protect
not only us but the fate of the world.

21:05.764 --> 21:06.682
Thanks, Mom.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.892
[woman]
Mayor's office. How can I help you?

21:10.018 --> 21:12.479
Oh, my Toby the Trollhunter.

21:12.562 --> 21:15.774
-Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. [chuckles]
-What a stud muffin.

21:22.864 --> 21:24.032
Claire, are you okay?

21:24.116 --> 21:27.494
Jim, I saw something in the Shadow Realm.

21:27.577 --> 21:30.539
It was like seeing memories from Morgana.

21:31.206 --> 21:33.542
You mean you saw another
magic Morgana memory?

21:33.625 --> 21:34.459
I saw...

21:35.627 --> 21:38.588
I saw your Amulet and a staff.

21:38.672 --> 21:40.424
[gasps] She had visions.

21:40.507 --> 21:43.802
-What sort of staff?
-It had a green gem.

21:44.469 --> 21:45.804
Staff of Avalon.

21:46.513 --> 21:49.349
Legend says it's in Merlin's Tomb.

21:49.433 --> 21:53.645
-I also saw... Angor Rot.
-Angor Rot?

21:53.729 --> 21:56.523
See? I was telling the truth.

21:56.606 --> 22:00.485
-He's back and he's after you.
-Are you serious?

22:00.569 --> 22:03.530
Did you see anything helpful
in those visions of yours?

22:03.613 --> 22:04.448
Yeah.

22:05.198 --> 22:08.327
-I found a way to Merlin's Tomb.
-That's helpful. [chuckles]

22:08.410 --> 22:13.832
But, Jim, to find Merlin's Tomb,
you're gonna have to destroy your Amulet.

22:14.958 --> 22:16.043
[Toby] Not helpful.
