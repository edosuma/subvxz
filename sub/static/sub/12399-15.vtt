He'll be our first official target

MICHAEL:
John Little was his CIA handler.

01:43.687 --> 01:46.474
He was found dead
in an alley in Paris yesterday.

01:46.648 --> 01:48.764
Just before his death,
Little stole a list...

01:48.942 --> 01:51.684
...containing the names
of every covert American operative...

01:51.862 --> 01:53.978
...working overseas in the oil industry.

01:54.197 --> 01:58.031
If Batouala proves CIA involvement,
he can kick the American oil companies...

01:58.201 --> 02:00.658
...out of his country
and make a deal with the Russians.

02:00.829 --> 02:02.865
He's attending a reception
in Paris tomorrow.

02:03.040 --> 02:06.828
There he'll hand over the file
to a Russian intelligence officer.

02:07.044 --> 02:09.126
We need to take
Batouala out at the party...

02:09.296 --> 02:12.129
...and retrieve the list
before he meets with the Russians.

You're talking about
another assassination.

Batouala's seen it. American agents
all over the world will be exposed...

was supposed to be the way in.

Come on, nerd, you've read the file.
Okay, Batouala is not some innocent.

03:01.556 --> 03:05.765
He runs a corrupt government who tortures
and murders anyone who gets in his way.

on the president's speed dial.

Michael can run the op without you.

I told the CIA to back off Batouala.

05:12.896 --> 05:14.477

05:14.898 --> 05:18.356

a heart attack in front of 500 people.

05:18.527 --> 05:20.142
Nothing can blow back on us.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.232
Heart attack gives us cover

Yes. Ryan and I will run the op

We have to keep it that way.

Why not tell them? This would be
a lot easier with Ops backing us up.

If they find out about
Danforth's contingency plan--

05:35.877 --> 05:40.746
