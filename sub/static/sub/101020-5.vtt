WEBVTT

00:11.511 --> 00:14.180
So, into an impoverished Athens,

00:14.264 --> 00:17.142
in the wake of war and civil unrest
arrives Praxagora,

00:17.642 --> 00:20.270
but after taking over
with a feminist uprising,

00:20.353 --> 00:24.190
we realize that our heroine,
spoiler alert, is a communist,

00:24.274 --> 00:26.234
-but she's also a thief.

00:26.317 --> 00:28.945
She wore a beard and presented herself
with a male voice.

00:29.029 --> 00:32.323
She hid in the shadows,
pulling strings to achieve her goals.

00:32.407 --> 00:33.700
-So...

00:38.538 --> 00:40.915
What did you do to your hair?

00:44.544 --> 00:47.172
I hope you got some reading done
in the salon.

00:47.756 --> 00:48.715
I'm sorry, Professor.

00:48.798 --> 00:49.799
Mm-hmm.

00:50.550 --> 00:53.678
So Jack, what do you think about Praxagora
using crime as a means to power?

00:53.762 --> 00:54.721
Um...

00:55.430 --> 00:57.432
It wasn't her fault.
The government was corrupt.

00:57.515 --> 00:59.059
So you're saying she's blameless?

00:59.142 --> 01:01.519
I'm saying power belongs to everyone,

01:02.228 --> 01:04.731
and if Praxagora had to steal it
to prove her point,

01:04.814 --> 01:05.815
maybe she was right.

01:09.944 --> 01:11.738
So, chalk one up for the good guys?

01:16.117 --> 01:16.951
Yeah.

01:17.035 --> 01:18.703
Okay. Moving on.

01:18.787 --> 01:21.498
Thanks to campus's recent football riot,

01:21.581 --> 01:27.253
I have rescheduled your exam
in Ethics and Classical Democracy for...

01:28.004 --> 01:28.838
tomorrow.

01:28.922 --> 01:31.091
-Go, Timberwolves.

01:31.174 --> 01:33.551
-What? You're upset?

01:34.636 --> 01:36.262
I've got to read the stupid things.

01:37.305 --> 01:38.223
Seriously.

01:40.225 --> 01:41.601
How could you do this to me?

01:42.268 --> 01:44.229
And behind my back? Are you kidding me?

01:44.479 --> 01:47.232
You know I picked that color out special
so we wouldn't clash.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.400
-What's going on?
-Nothing, it's no big deal.

01:49.484 --> 01:50.318
Bullshit.

01:50.401 --> 01:52.779
People don't suddenly change their hair
over no big deal.

01:52.862 --> 01:53.696
I should know.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.907
I bullied enough girl into bangs
back in middle school.

01:55.990 --> 01:59.160
I'm not your dress-up doll, okay?
Why do you care so much how my hair looks?

01:59.244 --> 02:01.246
I care how it makes <i>me </i>look.

02:01.329 --> 02:03.164
Now, where is this coming from?

02:04.874 --> 02:05.792
Are you depressed?

02:05.875 --> 02:07.585
Yes, I am depressed. Aren't you?

02:08.586 --> 02:10.713
-We lost one of our own.
-What do you care?

02:11.131 --> 02:13.007
As far as I know,
you hardly knew her, right?

02:13.341 --> 02:14.259
Right?

02:14.342 --> 02:15.844
Maybe I'm just not as cold as you are.

02:16.427 --> 02:17.345
I'm not cold.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.140
Duty calls. Gotta go.

02:29.023 --> 02:31.067
-Oh, crud.
-What?

02:32.235 --> 02:33.444
It's my original color.

02:34.279 --> 02:36.573
No, if the Grand Magus
summoned both of us,

02:36.656 --> 02:38.283
she must know I gave you back your memory.

02:38.366 --> 02:41.578
I told Vera that the hides returned
our memories, which is mostly true.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.164
I wonder why we're here, then.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.207
Just lucky, I guess.

02:48.626 --> 02:49.878
I'm sorry...

02:50.211 --> 02:51.337
about Lilith.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.132
Yeah, should have been me.

02:54.215 --> 02:55.300
Should have been no one.

02:56.718 --> 02:58.636
We live in a world
of magic and werewolves.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.306
There must be some way
that we can get Lilith back.

03:01.639 --> 03:03.183
Vera said it's too dangerous.

03:03.266 --> 03:05.935
Okay, when was the last time
you obeyed Vera Stone?

03:06.019 --> 03:07.270
I thought I'd give it a shot.

03:07.353 --> 03:09.063
At the rate I'm going,
couldn't be any worse.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.024
Careful.

03:11.399 --> 03:13.693
That almost sounds like personal growth.

03:13.776 --> 03:15.320
Well, we wouldn't want that, would we?

03:16.821 --> 03:18.448
Same old hair, same old Jack.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.408
Oh, I didn't think you noticed.

03:23.244 --> 03:25.038
Two days ago, we were contacted

03:25.121 --> 03:27.874
by an organization that may be
ultimately responsible

03:28.458 --> 03:29.918
for the theft of our property.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.629
You two are gonna help me
confirm that theory.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.797
You're gonna parlay
with the Sons of Prometheus.

03:35.215 --> 03:38.009
-We're meeting the Sons of Prometheus?
-<i>The Rules of Enoch.</i>

03:39.135 --> 03:42.388
Study it. Meet me here at 7:00 a.m.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.766
I'm sending you behind enemy lines.

03:45.433 --> 03:47.727
Find proof that the Prometheans robbed us.

03:47.810 --> 03:49.687
Something that I can rub their noses in.

03:49.771 --> 03:50.939
I have an exam tomorrow.

03:51.814 --> 03:52.690
Oh.

03:52.774 --> 03:53.608
No problem.

03:53.691 --> 03:54.984
I will simply reschedule

03:55.068 --> 03:57.695
a critical palaver
with an enemy organization

03:57.779 --> 03:58.738
around your plans.

03:59.280 --> 04:00.990
Yes. I know that's sarcasm,

04:01.074 --> 04:03.910
but you could just send
Randall and Hamish instead of us.

04:03.993 --> 04:06.162
The Grand Magus has made
her wishes known, acolyte.

04:08.665 --> 04:11.125
I just want to say, thank you
for trusting me with this mission.

04:11.209 --> 04:13.294
-It's an honor--
-Save the gratitude, Miss Drake.

04:13.378 --> 04:16.839
The only reason you're here is I have
not other use for a broken practitioner.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.467
Mr. Morton, a word.

04:25.515 --> 04:26.599
That was a bit harsh.

04:28.518 --> 04:31.229
It's imperative
that you keep your cool tomorrow.

04:31.312 --> 04:33.564
No outbursts of any kind.

04:34.148 --> 04:35.358
Tell me you understand.

04:35.441 --> 04:36.442
I understand.

04:37.318 --> 04:39.070
Get me what I want, Mr. Morton...

04:39.862 --> 04:41.823
and all will be forgiven.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.159
When have I ever let you down, Vera?

04:57.088 --> 04:59.382
Well, now I know
why Vera really wants to send me.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.136
You're a hostage?

05:03.219 --> 05:04.053
Yes.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.264
Alyssa and I are offered "freely"

05:06.347 --> 05:09.434
to ensure the safety
of the Promethean delegation

05:09.517 --> 05:11.311
while they confer with the opposing party.

05:11.394 --> 05:14.814
This is such a waste of time.
The Order's just slowing us down.

05:14.897 --> 05:17.817
We should've done 10 stupid things by now
to get Lilith back.

05:17.900 --> 05:20.653
Hey, we're gonna do
plenty of stupid things, I promise.

05:20.737 --> 05:21.988
So many stupid things.

05:22.071 --> 05:24.532
But for now,
we let the Order do the heavy lifting,

05:24.615 --> 05:25.700
then we get our stuff back.

05:25.783 --> 05:27.618
Yeah, then we're free to focus on Lilith.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.204
-If you see her locker...
-Or Midnight's.

05:30.538 --> 05:31.831
I'll grab them, I promise.

05:31.914 --> 05:34.042
There is something you guys can do for me.

05:34.542 --> 05:37.211
I'm supposed to be taking that Ethics exam
tomorrow morning.

05:38.129 --> 05:41.424
You want help cheating at Ethics?

05:41.924 --> 05:44.427
I get the irony, but I need this grade
to keep my scholarship.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.804
I know the material.
I just can't be there to take the test.

05:47.430 --> 05:49.932
How would we even take your exam for you?

05:50.016 --> 05:51.392
That's easy.

05:51.476 --> 05:54.062
Oh, hey, babe. Um, we, uh, were just...

05:54.145 --> 05:55.396
We're-- We're studying.

05:57.440 --> 06:00.026
Can the shit.
I know you've got your memories back.

06:00.443 --> 06:01.778
How'd you figure it out?

06:02.111 --> 06:03.237
Was it the hair?

06:03.321 --> 06:04.947
Oh, yeah, you changed your hair.

06:05.031 --> 06:07.241
I figured it out because I'm brilliant,

06:07.325 --> 06:09.535
and baby Tom Cruise here
is a terrible liar.

06:10.119 --> 06:11.454
And the hair didn't help.

06:11.996 --> 06:14.791
You do realize there's three of us
and only one of you.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.376
Cool down, tiger.

06:17.085 --> 06:19.087
I'll keep your secret, on one condition.

06:20.129 --> 06:21.714
You take my Ethics exam, too.

06:23.007 --> 06:24.592
Or else I tell the Grand Magus.

06:24.675 --> 06:25.593
She already knows.

06:25.676 --> 06:26.511
Then...

06:27.303 --> 06:28.554
I'll tell Kepler,

06:29.222 --> 06:31.599
-and she'll kill Vera.
- So?

06:31.682 --> 06:34.727
And you'll end up in a crate
begging for table scraps.

06:36.771 --> 06:39.732
Fine, we'll take your stupid test, too...

06:40.316 --> 06:42.402
if you can help us figure out how.

06:42.485 --> 06:43.945
Please. I can do anything.

06:44.028 --> 06:45.613
Except look bad in these pants.

06:46.697 --> 06:47.615
See you later...

06:48.324 --> 06:49.158
babe.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.537
With all due respect...

06:53.788 --> 06:55.164
she's right about those pants.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.166
Hey, remember when she murdered Kyle?

07:05.758 --> 07:06.676
Stay quiet.

07:08.886 --> 07:10.471
No sudden movements.

07:30.241 --> 07:33.244
On behalf of
the Esoteric Sons of Prometheus,

07:33.327 --> 07:36.080
and in accordance with the rules of Enoch,
we greet you,

07:36.622 --> 07:39.500
openly and unarmed,
Hermetic Order of the Blue Rose.

07:40.209 --> 07:43.421
On behalf of the Hermetic Order of the
Blue Rose, in accordance with the rules...

07:43.504 --> 07:45.882
I can't believe you tried to freeze me out
of this assignment.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.300
You're the one with glitchy magic.

07:47.675 --> 07:50.219
I can still do the work.
You don't need to send Randall and Hamish.

07:51.012 --> 07:51.846
Mr. Morton.

07:53.097 --> 07:54.348
-Mr. Morton!

07:55.141 --> 07:58.102
Please accept this humble gift
as a token of our sincerity.

07:58.519 --> 08:01.272
There was a card,
but it fell out somewhere.

08:03.441 --> 08:06.277
Please accept this gift
as a token of our sincerity.

08:06.360 --> 08:07.195
Hm.

08:07.278 --> 08:09.280
It has to be hand-washed,
or the logo will chip off.

08:09.363 --> 08:10.198
Okay.

08:10.281 --> 08:11.866
Three guesses who got the better gift?

08:11.949 --> 08:13.618
It's the thought that counts.

08:14.202 --> 08:17.705
In order to assure your safety,
I present to you these two hostages.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.796
Well, to make safe your bond,

08:25.880 --> 08:28.007
we Prometheans present ourselves in kind.

08:28.090 --> 08:30.468
I'm Xavier. This is Malachai.

08:33.387 --> 08:35.306
Hi... Xavier.

08:52.907 --> 08:57.662
<i>-Hae animae ligentur ligeturque haec caro.</i>

08:58.704 --> 09:00.998
We have a spell like this,
but we don't use the ribbon.

09:01.082 --> 09:02.750
It's just more festive with the ribbon.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.128
- Ow.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.429
The binding is complete.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.057
Parlay has begun.

09:25.773 --> 09:27.191
I'm Orbin. Please.

09:27.692 --> 09:28.526
Follow me.

09:30.027 --> 09:32.530
Follow the rules. Do not transform.

09:32.613 --> 09:34.740
If you do, his whole body could explode.

09:34.824 --> 09:36.325
So if he's dead, I'm dead?

09:36.409 --> 09:37.243
Yes.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.083
This is exciting.

09:44.542 --> 09:46.127
You know we're hostages?

09:46.210 --> 09:47.837
Where's your sense of adventure?

09:53.217 --> 09:54.302
Is it dangerous?

09:54.969 --> 09:56.971
It's a glamour. Totally safe.

09:58.222 --> 10:00.182
Now put those sacks over your heads
and shut up.

10:11.902 --> 10:16.198
<i>-Oculi veteres forma nova.</i>

10:17.533 --> 10:21.954
<i>-Oculi veteres forma nova.</i>

10:30.921 --> 10:32.006
Take them off.

10:33.424 --> 10:35.259
I don't feel different. Randall, do you--

10:35.343 --> 10:37.345
Holy shit!

10:38.179 --> 10:39.138
Dude!

10:39.221 --> 10:40.348
I'm a girl!

10:40.431 --> 10:42.558
Excuse me, you're a <i>woman.</i>

10:44.352 --> 10:47.313
This seems wrong.

10:47.396 --> 10:49.565
And probably sexist...

10:49.649 --> 10:50.524
or not.

10:50.608 --> 10:51.984
I can't tell anymore.

10:52.068 --> 10:52.943
Relax.

10:53.027 --> 10:55.071
The spell only lasts three hours.

10:55.321 --> 10:58.115
Until then, as far as
everyone's concerned, you're me and Jack.

10:58.532 --> 11:00.826
Just make sure you finish the exam
before time runs out.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.870
Oh! Here.

11:05.039 --> 11:06.290
Brought you some clothes.

11:07.708 --> 11:09.001
Also, can I say,

11:09.085 --> 11:11.128
I look amazing.

11:11.629 --> 11:13.297
Turn around. Let me see.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.596
-Hey.

11:20.930 --> 11:21.931
Don't be weird.

11:22.014 --> 11:23.057
We should get going.

11:24.558 --> 11:26.102
Do we have time for a drink?

12:19.321 --> 12:21.449
-The Prometheans have money.
-Shh.

12:22.742 --> 12:23.701
This way, please.

12:28.122 --> 12:29.415
Welcome to the Commons.

12:33.335 --> 12:36.547
This juice is our most rare
and sacred delicacy.

12:36.630 --> 12:39.675
We offer it to you in the spirit
of peace and brotherhood.

12:49.769 --> 12:50.936
It's delicious.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.397
Tastes... happy.

12:54.398 --> 12:56.984
We're glad you like it. I'm Essie.

13:00.029 --> 13:00.863
No.

13:01.363 --> 13:03.866
Rules of Enoch are clear.
You can't force anything on me.

13:04.825 --> 13:06.744
Don't think of yourselves as hostages.

13:06.827 --> 13:07.828
You're our guests.

13:08.245 --> 13:10.498
Now, hand over your cell phones
and any magical apparatus.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.013
Don't look at my photos.

13:29.058 --> 13:29.892
Now, then...

13:30.434 --> 13:31.477
who's up for a tour?

13:42.071 --> 13:42.947
It's beautiful.

13:44.031 --> 13:45.908
Yeah, if you're into this kind of thing.

13:46.325 --> 13:47.993
How large is your compound?

13:48.494 --> 13:49.328
Large.

13:50.037 --> 13:50.871
So there's more.

13:51.831 --> 13:52.706
Much more.

13:53.874 --> 13:55.167
It's a great tour, Orbin.

13:58.838 --> 13:59.964
-Hey.
- Jack.

14:01.048 --> 14:01.882
This way.

14:12.560 --> 14:15.020
We sell our surplus
at the local farmers' markets.

14:15.729 --> 14:17.773
Our honey has won the state fair
five years in a row.

14:18.440 --> 14:20.693
Might say there's a little bit of us
in everything we make.

14:20.776 --> 14:22.111
Catchy slogan.

14:26.323 --> 14:27.241
Be nice.

14:31.954 --> 14:35.457
In these buildings, we grow some of
our more exotic and delicate plants

14:35.541 --> 14:36.792
required for our magic.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.837
In here, we grow deadly nettle root,

14:39.920 --> 14:41.088
flowering tree, mahoni.

14:41.630 --> 14:43.591
And there, we grow wolfsbane,

14:44.300 --> 14:45.301
jenny root,

14:45.467 --> 14:46.594
and in the last one...

14:47.219 --> 14:48.053
kinbar.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.221
Don't mind them.

14:50.014 --> 14:51.098
They're just curious.

14:51.599 --> 14:53.225
We don't get many visitors here.

14:53.601 --> 14:54.894
What's, uh, over there?

14:57.438 --> 14:59.648
Just some utility buildings
for pesticide storage.

15:01.317 --> 15:02.776
Trust me, they're very boring.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.570
Well, I got nothing else going on, so...

15:04.653 --> 15:05.571
Uh...

15:07.072 --> 15:07.907
We do.

15:09.366 --> 15:11.327
Now if you'll excuse us, we...

15:12.578 --> 15:13.621
have some errands to run.

15:14.830 --> 15:17.583
And then we're going to throw you
a welcome mixer.

15:17.666 --> 15:20.294
-Oh, that's so nice.
- We told you, you're our guests.

15:20.711 --> 15:22.880
You're free to roam the grounds
at your leisure.

15:22.963 --> 15:26.383
Yeah, just don't try to leave,
or enter any buildings without an escort.

15:26.842 --> 15:27.760
Of course.

15:31.138 --> 15:32.389
What a plug.

15:33.641 --> 15:34.892
Would it kill you to be nice?

15:34.975 --> 15:35.809
Possibly.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.522
That area looks familiar.
I need to check it out.

15:42.566 --> 15:43.943
Yeah, well, um...

15:44.026 --> 15:46.153
...they're keeping a close eye on us.

15:46.236 --> 15:49.114
Right, you distract them at our little
meet-and-greet, and I'll sneak over.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.158
I told you not to sideline me.

15:51.241 --> 15:52.159
I'm not sidelining you.

15:52.242 --> 15:53.535
I'm good in a fight.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.287
Ask your fake girlfriend.
I punched her out.

15:56.413 --> 15:58.916
You-- You punched Gabrielle? Why?

15:59.458 --> 16:00.626
Relax, it wasn't about you.

16:00.709 --> 16:02.252
Well, then, why did you punch her?

16:03.337 --> 16:04.213
Huh?

16:05.005 --> 16:06.757
Alyssa, come on.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.144
Dude.

16:20.312 --> 16:21.146
Hambone.

16:21.939 --> 16:22.773
Hamelot.

16:26.735 --> 16:27.653
-Jack-off.
-Shh.

16:33.075 --> 16:34.451
How much time do we have left?

16:37.121 --> 16:38.330
Three minutes. Let's go.

16:43.877 --> 16:46.588
Okay.

16:53.137 --> 16:53.971
Hold it, Morton.

16:57.891 --> 17:01.687
Jack, uh, I'm hosting
a little event tonight.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.356
It's a bit on the political side,
but, uh...

17:04.440 --> 17:06.734
But given your leanings,
I think you might enjoy it.

17:06.817 --> 17:08.235
And what leanings are those?

17:08.318 --> 17:09.361
Don't be coy.

17:09.611 --> 17:13.490
You might look like one of them,
but you think like us.

17:13.574 --> 17:15.200
- Um...

17:15.284 --> 17:17.536
Okay, sure, yeah.
I should probably get going.

17:17.619 --> 17:18.537
Okay, yeah. Here.

17:19.329 --> 17:22.666
Take that, show it at the door,
and, uh, come early.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.126
I'm expecting a crowd.

17:24.209 --> 17:25.044
I can't wait.

17:32.217 --> 17:33.260
Hm.

17:50.027 --> 17:51.904
That was deeply unsettling.

17:56.742 --> 17:57.743
Randall?

17:58.619 --> 17:59.787
Oh, hey, Nicole.

18:00.412 --> 18:03.707
I am just experimenting because...

18:05.125 --> 18:07.377
it's college, so...

18:09.046 --> 18:09.880
I should go.

18:10.506 --> 18:11.590
You were her friends.

18:13.008 --> 18:14.384
You and Jack and Hamish...

18:15.302 --> 18:17.554
You were her friends,
and now you act like you don't care.

18:18.222 --> 18:20.432
I have no idea what you're talking about.

18:20.516 --> 18:21.558
Please.

18:21.642 --> 18:23.811
Lilith told me she had her memories back.

18:23.894 --> 18:25.104
You do, too, don't you?

18:28.315 --> 18:30.109
-I can't.
-Tell me you remember her.

18:31.318 --> 18:34.196
She was kind and funny
and strong and smart.

18:35.739 --> 18:38.367
I'm afraid if I'm the only one that
remembers her, she'll be lost,

18:38.450 --> 18:40.119
like she was nothing.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.289
She'll never be nothing.

18:44.665 --> 18:46.041
Then why aren't you doing anything?

18:46.125 --> 18:47.960
Because the Order won't let us.

18:48.043 --> 18:48.877
Something's up.

18:50.295 --> 18:52.131
Look, we'll talk later, I promise.

18:57.219 --> 18:58.262
Anything I should know?

18:58.720 --> 19:00.889
It's just... girl talk.

19:02.683 --> 19:03.809
Um...

19:03.892 --> 19:05.894
Professor Foley gave me an invite
to a meeting.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.063
-Does this symbol look familiar to you?
-Hold my purse.

19:08.147 --> 19:08.981
Yeah.

19:11.066 --> 19:14.820
Yeah, this was on
Killer-stick girl's computer.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.281
You think there's a link
between him and her?

19:17.364 --> 19:19.575
I think we need to find out. Come on.

19:25.956 --> 19:28.292
Thirty-five years ago,
the Sons of Prometheus

19:28.375 --> 19:30.794
and the Blue Rose were allies.

19:31.712 --> 19:33.338
We've come to renew that friendship.

19:34.256 --> 19:36.175
Let's skip the niceties.

19:36.258 --> 19:37.634
Xavier, what do you want?

19:38.468 --> 19:39.636
Straight to the point.

19:40.220 --> 19:41.180
We like that.

19:43.765 --> 19:45.642
Two days ago...

19:45.726 --> 19:47.144
...our compound was breached,

19:47.227 --> 19:49.271
and one of our fellowship was killed.

19:50.647 --> 19:51.523
Attacked?

19:52.608 --> 19:53.442
By whom?

19:53.525 --> 19:55.819
Not a "whom," Vera Stone.

19:56.778 --> 19:57.613
A "what."

20:00.365 --> 20:01.867
Have you ever seen a werewolf?

20:04.077 --> 20:05.829
Don't get me started on werewolves.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.247
I lost my eye to one.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.208
Took forever to grow it back.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.627
Sounds like we came to the right place.

20:12.085 --> 20:15.130
In my limited experience,

20:15.464 --> 20:19.551
werewolves aren't usually careless enough
to leave witnesses.

20:19.635 --> 20:20.886
Oh, don't be so modest.

20:21.845 --> 20:23.972
The Order is famous for two things:

20:24.056 --> 20:26.350
magic sex orgies and hunting werewolves.

20:26.433 --> 20:28.852
We stopped practicing sex magic
in the '80s.

20:30.020 --> 20:31.271
But hunting werewolves...

20:33.023 --> 20:34.942
I'm sure we could work something out.

20:36.485 --> 20:37.819
Elizabeth Kepler.

20:38.320 --> 20:41.573
And you must be Xavier and Malachai.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.493
You are very well informed.

20:45.535 --> 20:51.208
I am here to assist you
in any way necessary, Grand Magus.

20:51.625 --> 20:52.876
Shall we get down to business?

21:04.930 --> 21:05.847
Is that...

21:07.975 --> 21:09.643
A Cretian loom.

21:10.310 --> 21:12.521
-The last of the Daedilan treasures.

21:12.604 --> 21:15.941
Excuse me while I confer
with my colleague.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.113
Take your time.

21:25.701 --> 21:28.036
-Betsy, this is a surprise.
-No doubt.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.914
-Care to tell me what you're doing here?
-I'm here to keep an eye on you.

21:31.081 --> 21:33.417
Oh, and here you are with two of them.

21:34.167 --> 21:36.420
You destroy the <i>Vade Maecum</i>
without Council's permission...

21:36.503 --> 21:38.547
I think the word you're looking for
is "consultation."

21:38.630 --> 21:41.091
...and then you agree to a parlay
with a rival society

21:41.174 --> 21:42.634
-without alerting us.
-In my defense,

21:42.718 --> 21:44.303
this was all very short notice.

21:44.386 --> 21:47.347
I'm sure you remember how difficult
it can be to schedule a conference call.

21:47.431 --> 21:51.184
And now I find out your werewolves
were at the Promethean compound

21:51.268 --> 21:52.352
and they killed a man.

21:53.145 --> 21:56.064
I sent them to track down
the stolen sickles.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.524
Without running it past Council.

21:57.899 --> 22:00.569
If memory serves,
I was preoccupied stopping Rogwan,

22:00.652 --> 22:02.487
and you were saving your own skin.

22:11.538 --> 22:13.040
You need to act natural.

22:13.123 --> 22:15.000
This is me acting natural.

22:15.083 --> 22:17.794
Then act unnatural. Try mingling.

22:18.837 --> 22:21.590
I will, if you tell me
why you punched Gabrielle.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.550
Did she say something?

22:24.509 --> 22:25.469
Was it about me?

22:26.803 --> 22:28.680
Was it about that time
I tried braiding her hair?

22:28.764 --> 22:30.015
She tell you I have a tattoo?

22:30.515 --> 22:31.350
What tattoo?

22:33.060 --> 22:35.395
-Hope you guys are enjoying yourselves.

22:36.438 --> 22:39.066
Very much. You're all so welcoming.

22:39.149 --> 22:41.401
I was wondering
when we could see your temple.

22:41.485 --> 22:42.778
I bet it's beautiful.

22:42.861 --> 22:45.364
It is, and you'll see it
when the time is right.

22:45.447 --> 22:46.656
Cool.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.493
Our magic is cool.

22:49.576 --> 22:52.537
We're bound to the natural world,
and that connection gives us power.

22:53.288 --> 22:55.082
Tell me, Jack,
where does your power come from?

22:56.041 --> 22:57.709
-Well--
-Rage, mostly.

22:58.335 --> 22:59.169
Another drink?

22:59.252 --> 23:00.462
Yes, please.

23:01.338 --> 23:02.255
No, thank you.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.674
Oh, God, you're so narrow-minded.

23:04.758 --> 23:06.551
He was like this when we were dating.

23:06.635 --> 23:08.345
This is just like the sushi incident.

23:08.428 --> 23:10.305
You said you'd never tell anyone
about that.

23:10.389 --> 23:11.556
Would you just try some juice?

23:11.640 --> 23:13.016
-It wouldn't kill you.
-I said no!

23:13.100 --> 23:14.393
- No!

23:15.394 --> 23:16.395
Look at what you did!

23:16.478 --> 23:17.312
It was an accident.

23:18.188 --> 23:19.940
Forgive him.
He's not used to good company.

23:20.023 --> 23:20.982
It's okay.

23:21.608 --> 23:24.194
Jack, why don't you go clear your head?

23:25.612 --> 23:26.446
She's right.

23:27.072 --> 23:29.741
I'm sorry.
I'm just not used to being a hostage,

23:29.825 --> 23:31.993
so I'm going to go take a minute.

23:35.956 --> 23:37.416
I'm so sorry about that.

23:38.208 --> 23:39.042
It's okay.

23:43.755 --> 23:45.715
What makes you think
the Prometheans robbed us?

23:45.799 --> 23:46.633
Proximity.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.928
They are the closest society,
and it appears I'm right.

23:50.011 --> 23:52.347
You don't sit down to parlay
requesting knowledge

23:52.431 --> 23:54.224
and open the bidding with a Cretian loom.

23:55.642 --> 23:59.563
The Council will want proof if we're going
to accuse the Prometheans of this crime.

23:59.646 --> 24:03.108
I sent Mr. Morton and Miss Drake
under the guise of hostages

24:03.191 --> 24:04.484
for that very reason.

24:04.568 --> 24:06.194
They're searching the compound
as we speak.

24:06.278 --> 24:08.613
It would be faster to torture our guests.

24:08.697 --> 24:10.449
It would also be
against the rules of parlay.

24:10.532 --> 24:14.119
As soon as my disciples find the evidence
they need, we can discuss retaliation.

24:14.202 --> 24:17.080
Until then, we need to buy them
as much time as we can.

24:17.164 --> 24:18.081
Understood?

24:18.623 --> 24:19.583
Understood.

24:20.667 --> 24:22.878
Do you always have to have
the last word, Kepler?

24:23.336 --> 24:24.296
No.

24:25.464 --> 24:26.465
Gentlemen.

24:27.132 --> 24:29.259
My colleague and I have conferred.

24:29.342 --> 24:31.470
We've agreed to continue negotiations.

24:31.970 --> 24:32.846
Negotiate?

24:32.929 --> 24:34.973
Do you have any idea
how powerful the loom is?

24:35.724 --> 24:38.810
It can tear a hole through the realms
and patch it up like nothing happened.

24:39.186 --> 24:40.729
Only a fool would turn this down.

24:41.354 --> 24:43.273
<i>Stubbe's Guide to Transformation.</i>

24:43.356 --> 24:46.735
It's literally everything you ever wanted
to know about werewolves

24:46.818 --> 24:48.361
but were too afraid to ask.

24:49.613 --> 24:51.031
May we examine it?

24:51.448 --> 24:53.074
You may do whatever you like...

24:54.034 --> 24:55.327
for the right price.

24:59.956 --> 25:03.793
Look, all I'm saying is
if you want to be a secret society,

25:03.877 --> 25:05.545
don't slap a logo on everything.

25:05.629 --> 25:07.297
Branding matters. Here.

25:07.380 --> 25:08.381
What's this?

25:08.465 --> 25:11.426
In honor of our adventure this morning,
I call it a "Jekyll and Hyde."

25:16.139 --> 25:18.642
-Hamish, that's fantastic.<i> </i>What's in it?

25:18.725 --> 25:19.559
Coke and red wine.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.145
Don't you clowns ever shut up?

25:22.229 --> 25:23.355
You're still here.

25:23.438 --> 25:25.023
The world's not ready for two of me.

25:25.106 --> 25:27.567
Yeah, well, we're done, so...

25:28.235 --> 25:30.111
you want me to get you an Uber?

25:30.195 --> 25:32.656
As if I even want to hang out
with your stupid wolf pack.

25:32.739 --> 25:34.616
That's not what we're called.

25:34.699 --> 25:36.535
It's obvious you mutts
are up to something.

25:37.827 --> 25:39.496
Tell me, or I'm turning you in.

25:40.455 --> 25:42.499
You're blackmailing us

25:42.916 --> 25:44.334
to hang out with us?

25:44.417 --> 25:45.752
What? No.

25:46.878 --> 25:47.837
Don't flatter yourself.

25:47.921 --> 25:50.173
Look, we're just going
to some weird meeting

25:50.257 --> 25:52.592
with your possibly weird professor.

25:52.676 --> 25:55.679
Actually, I think it's best
that I did that one on my own.

25:55.762 --> 25:58.056
Whoa, whoa, whoa. First Jack, and now you?

26:00.100 --> 26:01.977
Why's everyone trying
to keep me out of the game?

26:02.060 --> 26:04.688
Because, man, you don't want action,
you just...

26:06.398 --> 26:08.900
You don't wanna sit still 'cause
you don't wanna think about her.

26:11.611 --> 26:12.445
So that's it?

26:13.405 --> 26:15.824
Our friend gets sucked into Hell,
and I'm...

26:15.907 --> 26:16.992
What, I'm grounded?

26:17.784 --> 26:18.660
Exactly.

26:20.120 --> 26:23.456
Look, as much as I love
watching hot guys fight over me--

26:23.540 --> 26:25.417
-Not about you.
-You're still here?

26:25.500 --> 26:27.502
How about a compromise?

26:28.795 --> 26:29.879
You go to the event

26:30.213 --> 26:32.507
while we scope out the professor's house.

26:32.591 --> 26:33.842
What's in it for you?

26:35.051 --> 26:36.720
Maybe I'm a good person,

26:37.262 --> 26:38.096
dickhole.

26:39.055 --> 26:41.057
Maybe I don't like seeing people get hurt.

26:41.141 --> 26:42.559
Is that enough for you losers?

26:44.394 --> 26:46.354
You're always saying divide and conquer.

26:49.316 --> 26:50.650
Reconnaissance only.

26:50.734 --> 26:52.152
Text me if you find anything.

26:52.235 --> 26:54.404
-Be careful.
- God, you sound like Vera.

26:54.487 --> 26:56.573
"Text me if you find anything."
"Be careful."

26:56.656 --> 26:58.450
"Don't slaughter innocent bystanders."

26:58.533 --> 27:00.910
Don't slaughter any innocent bystanders.

27:00.994 --> 27:03.121
He's always saying stuff like that.
He doesn't mean it.

27:10.712 --> 27:12.005
Dear God, help us.

27:34.819 --> 27:36.196
There you are.

27:51.419 --> 27:52.545
No. No. No. No.

27:56.091 --> 27:58.385
-What the hell?

27:59.135 --> 28:00.845
You're not supposed to be in here.

28:02.514 --> 28:03.723
I was looking for Alyssa.

28:05.308 --> 28:07.310
We tried to be cordial about this,

28:07.394 --> 28:09.646
and you've taken advantage
of our hospitality.

28:10.522 --> 28:13.358
It's time to treat you
like the hostage you are.

28:23.326 --> 28:24.911
I have to say, Orbin,

28:25.412 --> 28:28.289
as far as hostage experiences go,

28:29.082 --> 28:31.292
this has been one of my favorites.

28:31.835 --> 28:34.254
It is so refreshing to hear that
from a hostage.

28:35.463 --> 28:37.424
Well, just from the minute I arrived here,

28:37.507 --> 28:38.466
it just felt so...

28:39.884 --> 28:40.802
peaceful.

28:41.136 --> 28:43.680
-Was it like that when you joined?
-I was born here, raised here.

28:44.848 --> 28:46.057
My whole life is here.

28:47.892 --> 28:48.977
So...

28:49.769 --> 28:51.479
are all Prometheans born into it?

28:52.439 --> 28:53.773
We do accept new members,

28:53.857 --> 28:56.943
but only when someone dies,
to replenish our numbers.

28:57.610 --> 28:59.863
Our magic relies
on a very precise balance.

29:03.658 --> 29:05.744
And we share that balance with the earth.

29:12.292 --> 29:13.209
Impressive.

29:14.669 --> 29:16.755
We've discussed it as a group
and we all agree.

29:18.381 --> 29:19.924
You'd make an excellent member.

29:24.429 --> 29:25.388
I'm flattered...

29:26.473 --> 29:27.307
but...

29:28.224 --> 29:29.309
you wouldn't want me.

29:31.436 --> 29:32.896
My magic isn't working.

29:33.897 --> 29:35.523
There's something wrong with me.

29:41.404 --> 29:43.281
There is nothing wrong with you.

29:47.076 --> 29:47.911
I'll show you.

29:53.291 --> 29:55.585
Our power comes from all of us,

29:55.668 --> 29:58.129
living and feeling as one.

29:59.923 --> 30:00.924
You're a hive mind.

30:02.091 --> 30:03.384
It's called the Egregore.

30:04.511 --> 30:06.721
You've been experiencing its effects
all morning.

30:07.180 --> 30:09.224
That warm glow of welcome?

30:09.974 --> 30:10.809
That's us.

30:13.102 --> 30:14.604
I've been feeling it, like...

30:16.272 --> 30:18.691
Like shadows of people passing through me.

30:19.484 --> 30:20.360
Emotion...

30:21.653 --> 30:22.487
empathy.

30:22.570 --> 30:23.738
It begins like that.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.490
Soft and unclear.

30:26.366 --> 30:29.661
But as you become fully immersed,
we can share everything.

30:29.744 --> 30:31.538
Every thought, every fear,

30:32.121 --> 30:33.998
all knowledge and memory.

30:35.041 --> 30:36.251
Through the common...

30:37.377 --> 30:38.378
we are one.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.472
- Trust me.

31:01.901 --> 31:02.944
You fixed me.

31:03.444 --> 31:04.863
<i>You were never broken.</i>

31:05.238 --> 31:06.114
<i>Not here.</i>

31:25.717 --> 31:27.802
Closed for a private event.

31:34.475 --> 31:35.310
Where'd you get this?

31:35.393 --> 31:37.896
A mutual friend. Jack Morton?

31:38.146 --> 31:40.648
He couldn't make it, and he said
this would be right up my alley.

31:43.109 --> 31:44.027
Maybe next time.

31:46.696 --> 31:48.197
Uh... Look.

31:49.073 --> 31:50.909
I know I look like one of them,

31:51.534 --> 31:52.994
but I think like one of you.

32:00.293 --> 32:01.461
Cover's 20 bucks.

32:07.008 --> 32:09.010
Feels more like
a "pay what you can" sort of event.

32:13.431 --> 32:15.475
Look, if I was out of bounds back there,
I'm sorry.

32:15.558 --> 32:16.976
I was looking for my friend.

32:24.734 --> 32:25.568
You okay?

32:26.611 --> 32:29.322
Someone else's lips,
and all she does is think of you.

32:29.405 --> 32:30.531
What does that even mean?

32:31.908 --> 32:33.117
Means you're an idiot.

32:36.913 --> 32:37.956
And a werewolf.

32:38.706 --> 32:39.958
And you're really lucky.

32:47.590 --> 32:49.175
Hey! Alyssa.

32:50.093 --> 32:51.219
Jack, hi.

32:51.302 --> 32:52.679
Uh, what is it?

32:52.762 --> 32:54.931
I need to talk to you. Alone.

32:55.932 --> 32:56.808
Of course, Jack.

32:57.266 --> 32:58.434
No one's trying to stop you.

33:07.610 --> 33:09.278
We need to get out of here now.

33:09.362 --> 33:11.906
-That would be rude. We're their guests.
-They know I'm a werewolf.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.325
Someone else must have seen me
in human form when I was here

33:14.409 --> 33:15.827
looking for the Order's stuff.

33:15.910 --> 33:17.453
It was never here.

33:17.537 --> 33:18.746
You asked them about it?

33:18.830 --> 33:21.332
I didn't have to.
It's called the Egregore.

33:21.916 --> 33:22.750
The what?

33:22.959 --> 33:26.671
The first stage is empathy,
but eventually we'll share everything.

33:27.005 --> 33:27.880
Who's "we"?

33:28.464 --> 33:30.299
The Prometheans want me to join them.

33:31.467 --> 33:35.138
Oh, sorry, I shouldn't have told you that,
or about the Egregore.

33:35.805 --> 33:37.724
Alyssa, are you reading their minds?

33:37.807 --> 33:40.643
Not yet. Right now, I can only hear
the thoughts they direct at me.

33:42.478 --> 33:44.897
Okay. Okay, I shouldn't have
told you that either.

33:44.981 --> 33:46.816
Look, you need to stop
communicating with them.

33:46.899 --> 33:48.151
Shut them out of your brain.

33:54.365 --> 33:55.658
He did what?

33:58.995 --> 34:00.955
Is that true? Did you kill one of them?

34:01.039 --> 34:01.914
I'll explain later.

34:04.208 --> 34:10.006
Well, the Greeks had a word for
the process of turning ideas into action.

34:11.340 --> 34:16.304
They called it "praxis," but it is more
than an idea or, or a concept.

34:16.387 --> 34:19.182
It is the path to the new world,

34:19.432 --> 34:22.310
and that's why we call the group Praxis,
which is...

34:22.393 --> 34:24.228
-Yes?

34:24.604 --> 34:25.521
Okay, yeah.

34:27.607 --> 34:29.942
Everyone, please top up your drinks.

34:35.823 --> 34:37.075
We're about to get started.

34:40.745 --> 34:42.205
This place is depressing.

34:42.622 --> 34:44.123
-I'm depressed.
-Just hurry up.

34:52.632 --> 34:53.591
<i>Aperiatur.</i>

34:59.889 --> 35:01.307
You murdered their friend?

35:01.390 --> 35:02.642
It was self-defense.

35:05.228 --> 35:07.897
I'll hold them off as long as possible.
Get as far as you can.

35:07.980 --> 35:08.815
Shut up.

35:09.816 --> 35:10.733
This way.

35:13.361 --> 35:14.237
This way.

35:15.738 --> 35:18.574
The ones behind us are closing in,
and there's two more that way.

35:18.866 --> 35:21.077
Alyssa, are you reading their minds?
Can they read yours?

35:21.160 --> 35:23.329
If you can't pay attention
when we're not being chased,

35:23.412 --> 35:25.039
I'm not explaining this shit when we are.

35:25.123 --> 35:27.333
If you know where they are,
they'll know where you are.

35:34.882 --> 35:36.092
Leave her alone!

35:36.634 --> 35:38.803
Too late, Jack. She's not yours anymore.

35:43.057 --> 35:44.100
Alyssa, what are you doing?

35:45.017 --> 35:46.352
I'm sorry, but...

35:47.937 --> 35:49.480
...we've made up my mind.

35:51.232 --> 35:52.191
Stay back.

35:53.276 --> 35:56.028
Look, I want you to know
I respect your agency as a woman,

35:56.112 --> 35:57.572
but also, fuck this bullshit!

36:36.736 --> 36:38.154
Show-off.

36:58.716 --> 37:00.635
<i>Well, thank you all,</i>
<i>uh, for coming out.</i>

37:01.344 --> 37:03.012
Some of you I've met before,

37:03.512 --> 37:04.347
some are new,

37:04.764 --> 37:07.892
and some of you may not believe
what you're about to see tonight.

37:08.935 --> 37:11.938
<i>Some may call</i>
<i>what I'm about to show you...</i>

37:13.648 --> 37:14.482
<i>anarchy...</i>

37:16.025 --> 37:17.026
<i>or sedition...</i>

37:18.736 --> 37:20.071
or even terrorism.

37:21.364 --> 37:22.615
And they'd be right,

37:22.698 --> 37:24.200
because the truth is

37:24.283 --> 37:26.369
those are just other words for "freedom."

37:28.537 --> 37:31.457
Freedom...
It doesn't come from asking nice.

37:32.625 --> 37:33.918
Freedom comes from rising up.

37:34.001 --> 37:36.087
Freedom comes from fighting back.

37:36.170 --> 37:37.755
Freedom is never given.

37:37.838 --> 37:40.424
It must be taken,
and what we must take,

37:40.508 --> 37:41.801
what we must reclaim,

37:41.884 --> 37:46.180
is a secret so ancient and so powerful

37:46.264 --> 37:48.975
<i>that it has lived and died</i>
<i>several times already.</i>

37:49.058 --> 37:51.060
<i>A secret that could change the world,</i>

37:51.143 --> 37:54.021
a secret that <i>must </i>change the world.

37:54.105 --> 37:55.815
And that secret is this...

37:59.485 --> 38:00.486
Magic is real.

38:09.245 --> 38:12.707
<i>-Tarraing an tintreach!</i>

38:38.107 --> 38:39.233
I can't believe it.

38:40.943 --> 38:43.571
You only got 60% on my Ethics test?

38:44.238 --> 38:45.156
Are you kidding me?

38:45.239 --> 38:47.575
Look, I had one hour to study.

38:52.371 --> 38:54.707
Jack, there's no escape.
You need to surrender.

38:54.790 --> 38:56.000
Not yet, I don't.

39:43.422 --> 39:44.673
What are these things?

39:46.175 --> 39:47.510
They're the Egregore.

40:21.168 --> 40:23.587
We need to get word to Vera,
and let her know what's happening.

40:23.671 --> 40:25.423
They're not gonna let you do that.

40:36.892 --> 40:40.354
I'm sorry, Xavier, but this deal,
it's just not good enough.

40:40.438 --> 40:41.480
Not good enough?

40:42.440 --> 40:43.691
What more do you want?

40:44.442 --> 40:47.653
The loom, the Lost Book of Council,
the sigils of Moloch...

40:47.736 --> 40:49.238
<i>The Definitive Book of the Dead?</i>

40:49.321 --> 40:54.785
I think what my colleague is trying to say
is that you insult us with your avarice.

41:24.190 --> 41:25.065
<i>Obstruatur!</i>

41:26.859 --> 41:27.693
Ow.

41:28.736 --> 41:32.281
Well, if you think you can get
a better deal elsewhere, be my guest.

41:32.364 --> 41:35.409
Last I heard, Temple Mundi
was operating out of New Orleans.

41:35.493 --> 41:36.327
Fine.

41:37.119 --> 41:37.995
As you wish.

41:39.914 --> 41:42.625
This place used to be a lot more fun
35 years ago.

41:42.708 --> 41:44.418
The Grand Magus had a pinball machine.

41:47.129 --> 41:48.589
Wait, that's it?

41:49.298 --> 41:50.257
What else is there?

41:50.841 --> 41:52.635
The trade is off the table.

41:54.220 --> 41:57.264
Your shock spell is effective,
but it can't protect you forever.

42:04.230 --> 42:06.315
There was never going to be any trade.

42:08.108 --> 42:10.277
You didn't come here for help.
They're lying.

42:10.361 --> 42:11.737
How can you be so sure?

42:11.820 --> 42:14.657
Because of what my disciple
just carved on your forehead.

42:16.158 --> 42:17.159
Well.

42:20.037 --> 42:21.163
That's just rude.

42:21.247 --> 42:23.207
You want to tell me
what you're really after?

42:23.290 --> 42:25.334
Proof. Proof that
your werewolf attacked us,

42:25.417 --> 42:26.585
proof that you robbed us.

42:26.669 --> 42:27.628
We robbed you?

42:27.711 --> 42:30.422
And if your disciple's begging for help,
we have our proof,

42:30.506 --> 42:31.757
and soon we'll have our revenge.

42:31.840 --> 42:32.841
Xavier, wait.

42:36.011 --> 42:36.887
Yes.

42:37.429 --> 42:39.139
My werewolves raided your compound.

42:39.223 --> 42:40.849
Too late for honesty. You had your chance.

42:40.933 --> 42:42.643
They went because
they thought you robbed us.

42:42.726 --> 42:44.812
-Don't tell them--
-Shut up, Kepler!

42:45.354 --> 42:47.481
Can't you understand
what is happening here?

42:48.107 --> 42:52.152
Someone is playing all of us,
hoping we would end up just like this.

42:52.736 --> 42:54.321
You're not going to start a war.

42:54.405 --> 42:57.199
You're too late, Grand Magus.
