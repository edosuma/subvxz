00:05.266 --> 00:09.937
(Now, We Are Breaking Up)

00:19.317 --> 00:20.787
(Song Hye Kyo)

00:20.846 --> 00:22.287
(Jang Ki Yong)

00:24.156 --> 00:25.656
(Kim Ju Hun, Choi Hee Seo)

00:35.497 --> 00:38.997
A fashion designer designs four collections a year.

00:38.866 --> 00:42.667
(Now, We Are Breaking Up)

00:44.376 --> 00:45.436
It's that way.

00:49.077 --> 00:51.577
- Yes, we're ready. - Come on out now.

00:52.046 --> 00:53.546
Great. Go on.

00:57.217 --> 00:58.356
Every designer hopes...

00:58.357 --> 01:01.227
that each piece they design would become a beloved classic,

01:02.126 --> 01:04.497
but trends are always fleeting.

01:08.327 --> 01:09.926
Let's get ready now.

01:10.667 --> 01:12.697
Sun Young, get ready.

01:13.167 --> 01:14.507
Come on. Hurry.

01:20.706 --> 01:23.077
At the end of the day, there is only one thing that never changes.

01:24.376 --> 01:25.876
The fact that nothing is forever.

01:35.727 --> 01:40.426
(Welcome to the first ever K Fashion Week in Busan!)

01:48.306 --> 01:51.036
(Let's all celebrate this grand opening...)

01:51.037 --> 01:53.977
(of a new beginning tonight!)

02:09.287 --> 02:11.926
We must be in the moment and just enjoy it for this moment.

02:12.426 --> 02:16.167
Because it's fleeting too and will never come again.

03:35.007 --> 03:36.407
(What is your name?)

03:38.546 --> 03:39.646
(Why do you want to know my name?)

03:43.317 --> 03:46.357
(I was wondering how I should address you if we met again.)

03:46.916 --> 03:48.226
(That won't happen...)

03:48.687 --> 03:52.297
(because neither of us will be here after the Fashion Week's over.)

03:54.666 --> 03:55.827
(Have a safe trip back to Paris.)

04:36.606 --> 04:40.405
("Fashion comes and goes, but style lasts forever.")

04:40.406 --> 04:44.206
("I don't do fashion. I am fashion." Gabrielle Coco Chanel)

04:48.646 --> 04:51.915
(Now, We Are Breaking Up)

04:51.916 --> 04:53.687
(Episode 1)

05:00.757 --> 05:02.526
This is an announcement.

05:02.867 --> 05:06.137
All passengers for Korean Air 0078,

05:06.367 --> 05:08.737
please go to the departure gate.

05:09.807 --> 05:14.006
All passengers for Korean Air 0078...

05:14.007 --> 05:16.547
My gosh. There are so many models at this airport right now.

05:16.706 --> 05:18.016
They're everywhere.

05:18.216 --> 05:21.585
Dior, Chanel, and Givenchy fashion shows will be held in Korea?

05:21.586 --> 05:23.317
- Is this really happening? - Of course.

05:23.547 --> 05:25.786
Korea is now the most sought-after market in Asia.

05:26.187 --> 05:29.025
Hey, who would have thought that a K-pop song...

05:29.026 --> 05:31.856
- would top the Billboard chart? - Do Hoon.

05:32.327 --> 05:33.396
Good to see you.

05:33.697 --> 05:36.025
But even Olivier is doing his show here this time.

05:36.026 --> 05:38.436
- I never thought this would happen. - My point, exactly.

05:38.437 --> 05:40.465
"If you want to see my show, you'll have to come to Paris."

05:40.466 --> 05:41.736
He was always such a stuck-up snob.

05:41.737 --> 05:44.535
Look. K-pop, K-beauty, and K-dramas.

05:44.536 --> 05:46.876
Anything that comes from Korea is popular now,

05:46.877 --> 05:49.047
and fashion is no exception.

05:49.307 --> 05:52.275
Besides, he needs money if he wants to continue being such a snob,

05:52.276 --> 05:55.887
which means he can no longer ignore the market in Asia.

05:57.547 --> 06:00.617
Anyway, it's so nice not to have to take long-haul flights.

06:01.687 --> 06:03.926
If we want A-list celebrities,

06:03.927 --> 06:06.427
we have to land a sponsorship deal with Olivier no matter what.

06:09.666 --> 06:11.896
- Anyway, good luck. - Thanks.

06:12.336 --> 06:14.705
- Take it easy. - We'll be off, then.

06:14.706 --> 06:16.336
- All right. Take it easy. - Thanks.

06:23.007 --> 06:25.816
Hey, anything new?

06:25.817 --> 06:27.276
What do they want?

06:30.547 --> 06:31.786
Too difficult, right?

06:32.187 --> 06:34.927
But thankfully, we have a thing called an online translator.

06:35.757 --> 06:36.927
Let's see.

06:37.257 --> 06:39.525
With all the celebrities and money,

06:39.526 --> 06:42.096
they thought they had everything, but that wasn't the case.

06:42.666 --> 06:43.766
Mr. J.

06:44.396 --> 06:46.036
They don't have Mr. J.

06:46.396 --> 06:48.437
They've reached out to him a few times only to be turned down.

06:49.206 --> 06:50.265
"Mr. J"?

06:50.266 --> 06:53.176
You know, the photographer with many nicknames.

06:53.177 --> 06:55.006
Even fashion houses like Hermes, Dior, and Chanel...

06:55.007 --> 06:56.376
want to work with him.

06:56.377 --> 06:59.845
Right, isn't his name Jun? That Japanese guy.

06:59.846 --> 07:01.077
I heard he was Chinese.

07:01.416 --> 07:04.916
Oh, people call him "Cookie" these days.

07:05.257 --> 07:06.286
"Cookie"?

07:07.786 --> 07:09.656
That's such a cute nickname.

07:18.697 --> 07:21.567
(Mr. J, this is Sebastien from Olivier's atelier.)

07:22.206 --> 07:24.165
(We heard you turned down...)

07:24.166 --> 07:27.906
(exclusive contracts with Dior and Chanel.)

07:28.807 --> 07:30.976
(Mr. Olivier de Saint Sauveur is in Busan now...)

07:39.057 --> 07:40.317
(This is Olivier's atelier...)

07:42.627 --> 07:46.126
(Hello, this is Olivier de Saint Sauveur's atelier.)

07:46.127 --> 07:48.997
(Please call us back when you get a moment.)

07:51.497 --> 07:53.797
(- Any word from J? - No, nothing yet.)

07:54.966 --> 07:56.367
(I'll try calling him again.)

07:59.606 --> 08:00.776
(Persuade him at all costs.)

08:01.307 --> 08:02.676
(I know he's rejected everyone else,)

08:02.677 --> 08:06.417
(but not me because I am Olivier de Saint Sauveur.)

08:07.376 --> 08:08.616
(I need him.)

08:09.687 --> 08:12.316
(The colours and the angles that he uses.)

08:12.317 --> 08:14.486
(The warmth and the coolness, and the contrast between them.)

08:15.157 --> 08:17.027
(I need him, no matter what.)

08:28.106 --> 08:29.706
Earlier, you told me to wait for 30 minutes.

08:30.366 --> 08:31.506
It's delayed again?

08:34.476 --> 08:36.245
What's going on with the meeting with Olivier?

08:36.246 --> 08:37.605
He has meetings booked...

08:37.606 --> 08:39.517
with five other companies besides us.

08:39.746 --> 08:41.885
And there are so many people here trying to get a meeting with him.

08:42.187 --> 08:43.787
I've been waiting for three hours now.

08:43.986 --> 08:45.056
That sounds stressful.

08:45.057 --> 08:47.017
Right, Director Hwang has arrived too.

09:02.606 --> 09:05.505
The person you have reached is unavailable.

09:05.506 --> 09:06.677
Please leave a message...

09:13.817 --> 09:14.916
What about the photo book?

09:14.917 --> 09:17.547
I just picked them up at the print shop.

09:17.917 --> 09:20.517
- I'll leave right away. - Call me when you're here.

09:21.557 --> 09:24.356
Ms. Ha, Olivier still hasn't come down.

09:25.557 --> 09:27.196
How many meetings does he have before ours?

09:27.197 --> 09:28.267
Two.

09:29.626 --> 09:31.096
He's meeting with Viace just before us.

09:33.736 --> 09:35.705
You must be hungry. You should go eat something.

09:35.706 --> 09:36.835
I'll stay here.

09:36.836 --> 09:38.806
I had a big brunch.

09:38.807 --> 09:40.407
You should go eat something.

09:41.136 --> 09:43.105
I can wait until the meeting is over.

09:43.106 --> 09:45.345
But you haven't eaten anything yet.

09:45.346 --> 09:47.715
I'll call you as soon as Viace's meeting starts.

09:47.716 --> 09:48.716
Go eat something.

09:50.317 --> 09:53.115
Since Olivier has decided to break into the markets in Asia,

09:53.116 --> 09:54.355
they will certainly need our help...

09:54.356 --> 09:56.726
as Sono is the number one fashion brand in the country.

09:56.986 --> 09:59.455
That will be the focus of my pitch.

09:59.456 --> 10:01.866
I don't need to hear it. I want results.

10:02.667 --> 10:04.595
What would a mere fabric vendor like me even know?

10:04.596 --> 10:05.697
There's no point in telling me.

10:08.407 --> 10:10.407
I will keep you updated, sir.

10:10.506 --> 10:13.307
What is Chi Sook up to? I haven't even heard from her.

10:21.616 --> 10:23.286
The Olivier show is tomorrow, you know.

10:23.287 --> 10:24.686
She has a lot of reports to go through...

10:24.687 --> 10:26.057
for the meeting after the show.

10:29.586 --> 10:32.956
My secretary made a reservation at a restaurant for 7pm today.

10:33.697 --> 10:35.767
Make sure Chi Sook gets there on time.

10:39.767 --> 10:44.705
Young Eun. This love bug jerk has another woman.

10:44.706 --> 10:46.605
Make sure you bring enough...

10:46.606 --> 10:49.646
It was arranged by both families, so she'd better not embarrass me.

10:49.647 --> 10:50.906
Tell her to be on her best behaviour.

10:50.907 --> 10:52.246
Yes, sir. I will.

10:53.647 --> 10:54.746
(Director Hwang)

10:57.787 --> 11:00.356
Director Hwang, don't do anything.

11:00.886 --> 11:02.486
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

11:02.986 --> 11:04.327
I'm sorry. I'll come back another time.

11:12.767 --> 11:14.267
Hey, long time no see.

11:15.437 --> 11:17.566
This rude brat.

11:17.567 --> 11:20.677
He always makes me call him first and come to him.

11:28.787 --> 11:30.446
He's got a lot of nerve.

11:30.447 --> 11:33.215
I kindly let him check into the room first.

11:33.216 --> 11:35.226
How dare he sleep with another woman?

11:36.456 --> 11:38.797
She even posted a photo of them together.

11:53.037 --> 11:54.106
Who are you?

11:54.976 --> 11:57.106
Can you tell Jimmy to come out?

11:58.647 --> 12:00.646
Jimmy! Come out for a second.

12:00.647 --> 12:02.786
- Coming! Relax, will you? - Hurry!

12:02.787 --> 12:04.985
What would it take to satisfy you?

12:04.986 --> 12:07.256
My legs are still all wobbly from...

12:08.557 --> 12:09.626
Ms. Ha.

12:14.297 --> 12:17.396
Jimmy, you are the face of The One's male clothing line.

12:17.397 --> 12:18.696
And you have violated the clauses...

12:18.697 --> 12:21.267
in your contract regarding decorum and your personal life.

12:22.267 --> 12:23.705
I'm sorry. This was just a mistake.

12:23.706 --> 12:25.605
It really was. Please believe me.

12:25.606 --> 12:27.605
You will have to pay back three times the amount you received.

12:27.606 --> 12:28.606
You know that, right?

12:28.607 --> 12:30.776
I swear, nothing happened. I don't know her.

12:30.777 --> 12:32.245
Hey, do you know me? No, right?

12:32.246 --> 12:33.416
Why are you here?

12:33.417 --> 12:35.047
Come with me.

12:35.517 --> 12:36.786
As if.

12:36.787 --> 12:39.017
Who are you to tell me what to do?

12:39.157 --> 12:40.657
Not you.

12:41.517 --> 12:42.586
You, Jimmy.

12:43.256 --> 12:44.657
Can we just kick her out?

12:45.697 --> 12:46.856
You jerk.

12:47.456 --> 12:48.496
Chi Sook!

12:50.827 --> 12:52.296
No fighting, okay?

12:52.297 --> 12:53.865
Let's get this sorted out quietly.

12:53.866 --> 12:55.536
Killing and burying him is okay, right?

12:55.537 --> 12:57.466
It'll be done quietly, and no one will find out.

12:58.307 --> 12:59.976
Do you want to stay here or come with me?

13:11.917 --> 13:13.287
Doors are closing.

13:13.616 --> 13:14.787
Doors are opening.

13:20.726 --> 13:22.027
Doors are closing.

13:23.927 --> 13:26.336
- Hold on! Wait up. - Doors are opening.

13:28.297 --> 13:30.006
You got the wrong idea.

13:30.636 --> 13:32.476
Nothing happened.

13:32.606 --> 13:34.475
I met her at a club last night.

13:34.476 --> 13:37.046
She told me that she had nowhere to sleep.

13:37.047 --> 13:38.646
What was I supposed to do? Leave her in the streets?

13:38.647 --> 13:40.245
It gets very cold at night by the ocean.

13:40.246 --> 13:42.286
Come on. That's heartless.

13:42.287 --> 13:44.345
We slept in the same bed, but nothing happened.

13:44.346 --> 13:47.057
You think I had a one-night stand? No, not at all.

13:47.356 --> 13:50.226
I'm telling you the truth. Please believe me.

13:54.297 --> 13:55.827
Wait, hey!

13:57.626 --> 13:59.036
Hey!

13:59.037 --> 14:01.667
Please, forgive me just this once. I beg you.

14:06.636 --> 14:08.845
I had booked an ocean-view room,

14:08.846 --> 14:12.047
but a friend of mine said he couldn't get a room.

14:12.216 --> 14:14.345
He's still new to the PR industry,

14:14.346 --> 14:16.386
so he didn't know it'd be that hard to get a room.

14:16.647 --> 14:18.455
- And? - So,

14:18.456 --> 14:20.885
I kindly told him he could take my room.

14:20.886 --> 14:23.885
Why? It gets very cold at night by the ocean.

14:23.886 --> 14:25.356
Because I can stay with you.

14:27.057 --> 14:28.095
Bye.

14:28.096 --> 14:30.926
Fashion leaders from all around the world are here now.

14:30.927 --> 14:33.036
I am the CEO of Vision PR,

14:33.037 --> 14:35.306
one of the leading fashion PR agencies in the country.

14:35.307 --> 14:37.806
You still refuse to accept it, but I'm a celebrity.

14:37.807 --> 14:40.276
What does my room have to do with this?

14:40.277 --> 14:41.975
This is the first ever K Fashion Week...

14:41.976 --> 14:43.576
in Busan, and also in Asia.

14:43.577 --> 14:45.115
I need to stay where it's happening...

14:45.116 --> 14:47.475
to see what these people are wearing and what they listen to...

14:47.476 --> 14:49.517
so I can stay on top of the latest trends.

14:49.886 --> 14:51.687
There's only one trend happening at this hotel.

14:52.917 --> 14:54.157
Love and war.

14:55.017 --> 14:56.027
What?

15:08.167 --> 15:09.167
What?

15:10.537 --> 15:11.807
Got something else to say?

15:13.336 --> 15:16.047
Delete the photo of Jimmy you posted on your social media.

15:16.447 --> 15:18.206
And delete every photo of him on your phone.

15:18.407 --> 15:19.417
That's ridiculous.

15:20.447 --> 15:22.647
It's my phone. They're my photos I want to keep for memories' sake.

15:23.647 --> 15:25.917
Then I will sue you.

15:26.956 --> 15:28.625
Let's be honest. You two aren't even married.

15:28.626 --> 15:31.426
We hit it off. That's not against the law, is it?

15:31.427 --> 15:33.057
Go ahead and sue me.

15:33.596 --> 15:34.725
If a model's personal photos...

15:34.726 --> 15:36.426
circulate on social media due to girl problems,

15:36.427 --> 15:38.167
the brand image will be ruined as well.

15:38.366 --> 15:41.037
He violated the personal conduct and the portrait rights clauses,

15:41.267 --> 15:43.567
so we can hold him accountable for damages incurred.

15:45.006 --> 15:47.807
- Now, what do you say? - Darn it. This is so annoying.

15:55.716 --> 15:57.447
(Delete)

15:59.687 --> 16:00.756
There. Happy now?

16:07.327 --> 16:08.456
Darn it!

16:13.037 --> 16:14.437
This is your supplementary contract.

16:15.606 --> 16:18.536
If this happens again, you'll pay three times the amount...

16:18.537 --> 16:20.936
of the agreed penalty and compensate The One...

16:20.937 --> 16:23.047
for all damages incurred.

16:23.547 --> 16:25.146
If you agree to the terms,

16:25.147 --> 16:27.346
let's say it was a misunderstanding and leave it at that.

16:28.077 --> 16:29.287
Thank you.

16:31.986 --> 16:34.615
It's too easy. People don't take relationships seriously.

16:34.616 --> 16:37.056
No one is sincere.

16:37.057 --> 16:38.425
It's truly sad.

16:38.426 --> 16:40.756
You're not the one going through it, so calm down.

16:40.757 --> 16:44.125
At least he's trying, going back and forth between those two women.

16:44.126 --> 16:45.966
What about you? Are you not going to get married?

16:45.967 --> 16:47.766
You'll turn 40 before you even know it.

16:47.767 --> 16:49.037
You're already 40...

16:49.237 --> 16:51.307
and still single. Worry about yourself first.

16:51.467 --> 16:54.905
I'm waiting for my fate, the one I'm meant to be with.

16:54.906 --> 16:56.446
And I'm a misogamist.

16:57.047 --> 16:59.576
Do you think saying that makes you look cool?

16:59.577 --> 17:01.546
Be honest. You just don't want to take responsibility.

17:01.547 --> 17:03.787
That's right. I don't want to.

17:03.946 --> 17:06.717
My gosh, you're too honest.

17:07.257 --> 17:09.056
Why take responsibility for someone else's life?

17:09.057 --> 17:11.256
I just want to be free and independent.

17:11.257 --> 17:12.756
I want to keep living this way.

17:12.757 --> 17:14.756
So you just want to have fun with no strings attached.

17:14.757 --> 17:16.297
You said that in such a convoluted manner.

17:16.366 --> 17:18.865
Keep a safe distance, and you'll never expect anything...

17:18.866 --> 17:20.365
or be disappointed.

17:20.366 --> 17:22.465
So you wander around the world...

17:22.467 --> 17:25.636
and only take jobs that please your palate?

17:26.406 --> 17:27.906
Is that it, Mr. Cookie?

17:28.106 --> 17:31.175
What are you, dandelion fluff that travels all over the world?

17:31.176 --> 17:33.146
I'm just trying to live in the moment.

17:34.277 --> 17:36.287
For work and love as well.

17:37.916 --> 17:39.956
Meet someone who's passionate.

17:39.957 --> 17:42.056
And when it happens, cherish your fate.

17:42.057 --> 17:43.656
That being said...

17:44.156 --> 17:45.956
Let me stay with you.

17:45.957 --> 17:47.057
Where is your room?

17:48.096 --> 17:49.997
Hey, Do Hoon!

17:52.767 --> 17:54.366
It was just a one-night stand.

18:06.446 --> 18:09.017
He said he was drunk. It can happen, you know.

18:09.346 --> 18:11.217
It's lame to dwell on it.

18:15.957 --> 18:17.057
What about Jimmy?

18:17.856 --> 18:19.396
I warned him, so he knows not to do it again.

18:19.827 --> 18:23.096
The word won't get out, so President Hwang won't find out.

18:24.527 --> 18:25.596
Really?

18:26.797 --> 18:28.736
Right, you should get a new purse.

18:28.737 --> 18:30.067
You've had that one for a long time.

18:32.876 --> 18:34.875
President Hwang said the reservation is at 7pm.

18:34.876 --> 18:37.007
I booked an appointment at the salon for you. Don't be late.

18:56.797 --> 18:58.067
Jerk.

18:59.396 --> 19:01.267
Why were you in such a rush to leave?

19:01.366 --> 19:03.507
You left without even giving me an excuse.

19:28.797 --> 19:29.896
Where are we going?

19:30.327 --> 19:33.037
A restaurant that's very popular among couples these days.

19:33.636 --> 19:36.136
Why would I go there with you?

19:36.906 --> 19:38.807
Thanks to you, I don't have to pay for a hotel room.

19:38.977 --> 19:41.375
I'll buy you dinner, so come on time.

19:41.376 --> 19:43.905
Gosh, I've been so sleep-deprived because of work.

19:43.906 --> 19:45.915
I'm exhausted.

19:45.916 --> 19:48.247
Where are you going now if you're that tired?

19:48.346 --> 19:50.186
There are all these fashion shows happening.

19:50.287 --> 19:52.456
I need to meet people and build connections.

19:52.457 --> 19:55.086
The main ones don't start until tomorrow. Get some sleep.

19:55.557 --> 19:58.185
Hey, you shouldn't put off anything in life.

19:58.186 --> 20:00.125
If you don't act now, you may lose it forever.

20:00.126 --> 20:01.656
So seize every opportunity that comes your way.

20:03.027 --> 20:04.296
Meet me at 7pm.

20:04.297 --> 20:06.037
It's an expensive place, so come dressed up.

20:24.086 --> 20:25.286
How's this?

20:25.287 --> 20:27.686
Put a bit more.

20:28.487 --> 20:31.327
- Stack them more uniformly. - Okay.

20:39.396 --> 20:40.967
You did so well.

20:41.797 --> 20:42.936
Please stand up.

20:44.166 --> 20:47.506
The person who prepared today's menu the best...

20:47.507 --> 20:50.146
is Madam Min again.

20:52.747 --> 20:55.717
Food should look stylish too.

20:55.916 --> 20:58.016
Garnish that is beautiful and classy...

20:58.017 --> 21:00.086
makes the dish look even better.

21:00.317 --> 21:02.957
Shall we put the finishing touches to your dishes?

21:04.787 --> 21:06.996
That woman comes first all the time.

21:06.997 --> 21:08.226
Why does she even learn?

21:08.227 --> 21:10.096
Is she going to open a restaurant?

21:10.267 --> 21:12.067
She looks rich.

21:12.997 --> 21:14.335
If she's rich,

21:14.336 --> 21:16.707
why would she learn something that gets her hands wet?

21:17.067 --> 21:18.436
What an odd hobby.

21:18.567 --> 21:20.635
Her late husband was a doctor.

21:20.636 --> 21:22.846
She often volunteers at a nursing home.

21:25.676 --> 21:29.116
I find it hard to approach people who are good at everything.

21:37.386 --> 21:39.396
- Hi, Do Hoon. - Ms. Min.

21:42.497 --> 21:44.727
Her unmarried son lives in France.

21:46.666 --> 21:47.666
Son?

21:49.406 --> 21:51.606
I gave Jae Guk the location.

21:52.477 --> 21:54.406
Of course. You know me.

21:54.636 --> 21:56.547
He will be there.

22:17.797 --> 22:18.936
What do you mean?

22:19.467 --> 22:21.396
It's totally unbelievable.

22:21.696 --> 22:25.007
He complained about his condition and jet lag and whatnot,

22:25.307 --> 22:27.307
then suddenly pushed everything to tomorrow.

22:27.807 --> 22:29.906
Isn't this just plain rude?

22:33.176 --> 22:34.176
Okay.

22:34.177 --> 22:36.446
Confirm tomorrow's schedule and leave.

22:37.116 --> 22:38.146
Good job.

22:43.156 --> 22:44.886
This is Ha Young Eun from The One.

22:46.027 --> 22:48.126
Chi Sook's not there yet?

22:48.856 --> 22:51.626
Sorry. Let me check and get back to you.

22:52.997 --> 22:54.366
(Director Hwang)

22:56.767 --> 22:58.537
- Where are you? - Ha Young Eun.

22:59.007 --> 23:02.807
Jimmy that punk hasn't called once.

23:03.077 --> 23:05.977
He even left the tie I got him in Milan.

23:06.846 --> 23:08.077
He didn't come back for it.

23:09.017 --> 23:11.146
I said you have an appointment at seven.

23:11.717 --> 23:13.656
Stay where you are. I'll come over.

23:22.896 --> 23:24.865
I told you to talk to her nicely...

23:24.866 --> 23:26.296
and you drew blood?

23:26.297 --> 23:27.767
Your blood?

23:28.366 --> 23:30.307
You really lost your mojo.

23:30.737 --> 23:33.077
I lost my self-esteem too.

23:33.977 --> 23:35.606
And you spend too much.

23:36.707 --> 23:39.676
I spend a fortune at salons just to stay young.

23:40.446 --> 23:41.776
My skin may be taut,

23:41.777 --> 23:43.416
but my bones must be hollow.

23:44.787 --> 23:48.186
Gosh, that wench... Is it her young age?

23:48.317 --> 23:51.056
She was strong and she could take a punch.

23:51.057 --> 23:52.355
Forget your hair.

23:52.356 --> 23:54.757
You can be there on time if you fix your makeup.

23:56.626 --> 23:58.096
She was so confident.

23:58.527 --> 24:02.267
She said that to Jimmy, I was just an expensive wallet.

24:02.606 --> 24:04.866
He felt sorry for me for not knowing that,

24:05.307 --> 24:07.537
so he just played along.

24:08.237 --> 24:10.105
He's from your father's old neighbourhood,

24:10.106 --> 24:12.345
and before he died, he was a respected doctor.

24:12.346 --> 24:13.445
You'll meet his son,

24:13.446 --> 24:16.317
so he'll have high hopes about family and character.

24:17.116 --> 24:19.155
If you can survive the aftermath of blowing him off,

24:19.156 --> 24:20.415
stay here and cry.

24:20.416 --> 24:21.856
Young Eun.

24:22.356 --> 24:25.057
Even if I spent a huge amount on him,

24:25.797 --> 24:28.557
he must care for me enough to cover the interest.

24:29.126 --> 24:30.327
Or so I thought.

24:30.527 --> 24:33.037
Lament your poor judgement later.

24:36.737 --> 24:38.406
You've been through enough.

24:38.807 --> 24:40.506
Quit the dangerous emotional play...

24:40.507 --> 24:42.676
and live a safe, stable life, okay?

24:45.007 --> 24:46.376
Men mean nothing.

24:48.717 --> 24:52.585
Hey. Whether I just had fun with Jimmy or was serious,

24:52.586 --> 24:54.217
how would you know?

24:54.487 --> 24:55.615
Men?

24:55.616 --> 24:57.527
Yes, I crave men.

24:58.287 --> 24:59.696
Aren't you?

25:00.696 --> 25:03.866
What were you doing when you turned off your phone?

25:34.797 --> 25:36.595
Don't act like you're classy.

25:36.596 --> 25:39.297
Acting like you don't care doesn't make you different.

25:39.666 --> 25:40.696
I am different.

25:41.166 --> 25:44.566
You believe in pointless things like men and love,

25:44.567 --> 25:45.707
but I don't.

25:46.807 --> 25:48.936
That one experience was enough.

25:49.446 --> 25:50.477
You witch.

25:51.376 --> 25:53.916
How come you're never a friend?

25:55.817 --> 25:57.817
You never apologize.

25:58.487 --> 26:00.685
I just think it's fortunate it was water...

26:00.686 --> 26:01.987
and that it won't smudge.

26:02.356 --> 26:03.686
That's what we have.

26:03.987 --> 26:05.586
Don't expect friendship.

26:05.896 --> 26:08.457
To you, my dad's trust and favour come before a friend.

26:09.027 --> 26:11.365
Unlike someone, I don't have a large sum...

26:11.366 --> 26:12.425
to invest for the interest.

26:12.426 --> 26:13.766
I must run around all day even if I starve...

26:13.767 --> 26:16.405
because I don't have five minutes to eat a pastry.

26:16.406 --> 26:19.106
You don't see that I want to drop dead, do you?

26:19.707 --> 26:23.077
Even then, I'm always thankful for what you did.

26:23.547 --> 26:25.106
You're well worth it.

26:28.146 --> 26:30.217
The cold will help you sober up.

26:30.586 --> 26:32.017
I can't go.

26:32.386 --> 26:34.886
No. I won't go.

26:44.267 --> 26:46.166
I can't go looking like this.

26:46.636 --> 26:48.695
"Your daughter appeared half drunk..."

26:48.696 --> 26:50.135
"with a bruised neck."

26:50.136 --> 26:51.507
Dad will hear about it right away.

26:52.007 --> 26:53.777
He would be so pleased.

26:53.906 --> 26:55.875
We can make up an excuse for that.

26:55.876 --> 26:57.906
You'll be at fault if you don't show up at all.

27:01.146 --> 27:02.446
You go instead.

27:03.946 --> 27:06.487
You can show up and be Hwang Chi Sook.

27:07.356 --> 27:09.986
Call your father and tell him that yourself.

27:09.987 --> 27:11.356
I'll do it if he says yes.

27:12.487 --> 27:13.626
Do it.

27:14.396 --> 27:15.457
Do it?

27:16.467 --> 27:18.666
He'll hold you responsible for not...

27:18.827 --> 27:20.466
watching me closer.

27:20.467 --> 27:22.296
- Wouldn't you mind? - Director Hwang.

27:22.297 --> 27:26.577
Let's keep this between us and sweep it under the rug.

27:30.106 --> 27:33.517
Getting dumped in the morning by a guy who wanted my money,

27:34.346 --> 27:37.517
and meeting a guy in the evening who wants my dad's money?

27:39.757 --> 27:41.557
I really can't do that.

27:44.557 --> 27:45.656
Okay?

27:49.057 --> 27:51.267
I'll set things up for the event.

27:54.636 --> 27:59.207
(Hwang)

28:02.676 --> 28:07.047
(Yoon Jae Guk, Hwang Chi Sook)

28:09.446 --> 28:11.616
The fool...

28:12.817 --> 28:14.586
(Do Hoon)

28:14.757 --> 28:15.787
My gosh.

29:00.237 --> 29:01.796
I called the restaurant.

29:01.797 --> 29:03.537
He got there on time.

29:03.906 --> 29:06.477
Sorry for bothering you when you must be busy.

29:06.737 --> 29:08.277
He's getting older,

29:08.436 --> 29:11.076
and as his mom, I had to do something.

29:11.077 --> 29:13.116
So I asked for your help.

29:14.416 --> 29:15.987
You did the right thing.

29:16.886 --> 29:17.946
But Ms. Min.

29:18.817 --> 29:19.957
Who is the lady?

29:31.896 --> 29:33.366
I'm sorry I'm late.

29:35.967 --> 29:37.007
(Yoon Jae Guk, Hwang Chi Sook)

29:38.866 --> 29:40.007
You're Ms. Hwang Chi Sook?

29:41.507 --> 29:43.346
Let's say so for now.

29:46.717 --> 29:47.876
I'm Yoon Jae Guk.

29:48.376 --> 29:50.717
I have some issues at work.

29:50.916 --> 29:52.487
I know it's rude but I must...

30:06.336 --> 30:07.596
"But I must"...

30:08.336 --> 30:09.406
and what?

30:11.207 --> 30:13.576
You went to the trouble of making a reservation,

30:13.577 --> 30:15.875
and it looks like you put in some effort.

30:15.876 --> 30:18.077
I'll eat, then leave right away.

30:35.896 --> 30:38.665
Blood transfusions can save lives,

30:38.666 --> 30:40.865
but it's accompanied with severe side effects.

30:40.866 --> 30:43.406
Safety measures are a must and must be adhered to.

30:43.936 --> 30:46.675
But according to our investigative team...

30:46.676 --> 30:47.777
What do you think?

30:48.106 --> 30:50.277
I haven't even swallowed yet.

30:50.846 --> 30:53.247
Patients have been suffering.

30:53.416 --> 30:54.875
Our reporter has more details.

30:54.876 --> 30:55.946
Quit taking classes.

30:56.247 --> 30:59.616
If this is the best you can do, I'd rather eat out.

31:01.017 --> 31:02.615
Eat it while you can.

31:02.616 --> 31:04.457
It could always be your last chance.

31:04.926 --> 31:06.557
Are you about to die or something?

31:09.227 --> 31:11.996
Let's marry off Young Eun.

31:11.997 --> 31:14.666
It's widely given to patients.

31:15.136 --> 31:16.207
But women...

31:18.207 --> 31:19.406
You know an eligible man?

31:19.737 --> 31:22.737
I asked the young ladies at my cooking class.

31:23.406 --> 31:25.406
He's from a decent family,

31:25.807 --> 31:28.876
and his mother has a respectable personality.

31:29.077 --> 31:31.885
The man works at a foreign company,

31:31.886 --> 31:34.017
so he must be pretty capable.

31:34.957 --> 31:37.856
I think he's sweet too.

31:40.027 --> 31:41.027
Is he?

31:44.267 --> 31:45.365
Na Ri.

31:45.366 --> 31:49.067
Did you ask which brands want to collaborate with Olivia?

31:49.737 --> 31:50.737
Tell me.

31:53.106 --> 31:54.277
And the hanger?

31:54.936 --> 31:58.346
Once he agrees to a deal, we must work on the next season.

31:58.477 --> 32:01.517
See what you like and ask for samples right away.

32:02.376 --> 32:05.017
There can be minute differences with the dye, so check the quality.

32:05.846 --> 32:06.916
Bye.

32:12.557 --> 32:13.896
(Director Hwang)

32:23.567 --> 32:26.506
I apologize. I'm on a business trip,

32:26.507 --> 32:28.605
and if I didn't have to be here,

32:28.606 --> 32:30.577
I would be hard at work.

32:31.077 --> 32:34.146
In the morning, she drags a man out of a hotel suite,

32:34.846 --> 32:37.586
and in the evening, she works through a blind date?

32:38.217 --> 32:39.317
Are you a designer?

32:41.386 --> 32:42.856
I'm a freelance photographer.

32:43.457 --> 32:44.787
I shoot fashion models.

32:50.467 --> 32:52.166
We could've already met.

32:53.336 --> 32:54.737
Photographers and designers...

32:55.336 --> 32:57.436
often cross paths during such events.

32:58.737 --> 33:02.436
The encounters that have no impact mean nothing to me.

33:06.106 --> 33:07.416
"No impact"?

33:08.176 --> 33:09.616
There's not much.

33:10.717 --> 33:13.616
You don't have that good an eye for a designer.

33:14.757 --> 33:16.787
I rarely forget a face...

33:17.957 --> 33:19.757
that was once in my frame.

33:22.596 --> 33:25.067
I'm not here because I want to be.

33:25.396 --> 33:27.536
I had no choice but to show up,

33:27.537 --> 33:30.267
and I don't think I'll see you again.

33:30.606 --> 33:31.666
Goodbye.

33:32.007 --> 33:33.307
There's still dessert.

33:34.136 --> 33:35.777
I don't like sweet foods.

33:36.106 --> 33:37.446
Then how about hot tea?

33:38.077 --> 33:39.877
Tea is only hot for a short while.

33:41.846 --> 33:43.647
You sound upset by that.

33:50.187 --> 33:52.587
Excuse me, then.

34:13.775 --> 34:15.715
What should I do, Ms. Ha?

34:15.716 --> 34:17.016
Why? What's wrong?

34:17.485 --> 34:20.056
I think the file got swapped before we sent it to the printers.

34:21.857 --> 34:24.627
Tell So Young to email you the original file.

34:24.687 --> 34:26.087
Let's print it out here.

34:35.065 --> 34:37.136
- Did you find the original copy? - It's not here.

34:37.366 --> 34:40.337
I checked your desk and the manager's,

34:40.676 --> 34:42.036
but I can't find it.

34:46.176 --> 34:47.417
Let's shoot it again here.

34:47.716 --> 34:48.815
What?

34:48.815 --> 34:51.587
Olivier postponed all the meetings to tomorrow.

34:51.746 --> 34:54.857
We've earned some time, and the samples are all here.

34:54.956 --> 34:56.114
We can shoot it tomorrow.

34:56.116 --> 34:58.056
I'll hire some models.

34:58.057 --> 34:59.256
What about the photographer?

34:59.557 --> 35:01.525
The people who shot for us...

35:01.526 --> 35:04.127
are all at the show event and unavailable.

35:04.526 --> 35:07.037
Oh, no. What should we do?

35:09.807 --> 35:12.366
I'm a freelance photographer. I shoot fashion models.

35:19.577 --> 35:20.616
Wait.

36:02.756 --> 36:03.857
Are you looking for someone?

36:10.997 --> 36:12.426
Are you free tomorrow?

36:14.796 --> 36:15.937
Will you work part-time?

36:16.707 --> 36:17.807
Do what?

36:18.236 --> 36:19.937
You said you shoot fashion photos.

36:20.506 --> 36:22.477
I'll give you a feel of the scene.

36:27.716 --> 36:30.087
I'm a designer for The One.

36:30.787 --> 36:32.986
I see. And?

36:33.756 --> 36:36.485
This is still a secret, but for the next season,

36:36.486 --> 36:38.957
we're working on a collaboration with Olivier.

36:39.187 --> 36:41.656
This could be a great opportunity for you.

36:41.997 --> 36:43.096
Let's see...

36:43.426 --> 36:45.796
I'm usually the one to decide what I do.

36:47.037 --> 36:48.537
I make up my own mind.

36:51.107 --> 36:54.406
Working with professionals like me would make you feel proud.

36:57.147 --> 36:59.176
I'll get that feeling when I want.

37:00.377 --> 37:02.416
If you gain the experience,

37:02.417 --> 37:05.087
when the time comes to sign with a magazine or agency,

37:05.187 --> 37:06.346
it'll come in handy.

37:07.417 --> 37:08.587
So I must do it?

37:09.886 --> 37:12.327
Yes. You're my only option.

37:15.857 --> 37:18.667
There's very little proof we can trust him with the job.

37:19.667 --> 37:21.736
His camera bag is very old.

37:21.966 --> 37:23.406
It means he used it a lot.

37:23.636 --> 37:25.006
He's not a complete novice.

37:27.377 --> 37:28.477
The models?

37:29.006 --> 37:30.807
I pulled some strings.

38:03.247 --> 38:04.307
You're Ms. Hwang Chi Sook?

38:05.046 --> 38:06.776
Let's say so for now.

38:15.557 --> 38:16.687
How interesting.

38:41.147 --> 38:42.576
(Jimmy)

38:42.577 --> 38:43.587
(Kim Sunghee, Park Jihye)

38:47.917 --> 38:50.557
Kim Sung Hee's first line is in this order.

38:50.787 --> 38:51.856
And Park Ji Hye's?

38:51.857 --> 38:54.595
- The colour scheme overlaps. - We'll go with the dress?

38:54.596 --> 38:55.897
- That's okay? - Yes.

38:56.296 --> 38:59.126
Sun Ju, check the models' hair and makeup.

38:59.127 --> 39:00.195
Okay.

39:00.196 --> 39:02.497
- Is that set up? - Yes, it's ready.

39:07.477 --> 39:08.636
Jae Guk.

39:09.537 --> 39:11.477
Can you lend me a tie?

39:12.176 --> 39:13.747
Olivier's show is today.

39:14.116 --> 39:15.716
I need something that stands out.

39:17.747 --> 39:18.917
Cookie.

39:22.116 --> 39:24.457
Cookie.

40:06.937 --> 40:10.107
We must finish it before lunch, so take the bare minimum of shots.

40:10.566 --> 40:11.807
I'll handle it.

40:20.046 --> 40:21.845
If you go lo-Fi instead of JPG,

40:21.846 --> 40:23.315
it'll be easier to get the details.

40:23.316 --> 40:24.985
We don't need the photos retouched.

40:24.986 --> 40:27.485
The concept is on the mood board.

40:27.486 --> 40:29.857
Zoom in on the outfits.

40:30.486 --> 40:31.787
I will handle it.

40:34.756 --> 40:36.026
Let's begin.

40:39.327 --> 40:40.537
- Call them. - This way.

40:41.397 --> 40:42.837
Set up the lights, please.

41:05.687 --> 41:07.196
I like where you two are standing.

41:07.357 --> 41:10.397
Ji Hye and Sung Hee can stand in the center.

41:11.827 --> 41:14.037
You at the far left, take a few steps back.

41:14.296 --> 41:15.667
This is my spot.

41:21.977 --> 41:23.207
Okay, let's begin.

41:29.176 --> 41:30.417
Stand a bit closer.

41:30.917 --> 41:31.986
Great.

41:33.756 --> 41:34.787
Okay.

41:38.557 --> 41:39.885
Na Ri.

41:39.886 --> 41:41.826
I'm Director Hwang Chi Sook for today, okay?

41:41.827 --> 41:42.827
What?

41:45.827 --> 41:47.036
Oh, I get it.

41:47.037 --> 41:49.036
You pretended to be Director Hwang to bring him here.

41:49.037 --> 41:50.505
Well, it makes sense. She was the one...

41:50.506 --> 41:52.905
who hired all the other staff members anyway.

41:52.906 --> 41:53.977
Okay, you got it.

42:06.346 --> 42:07.386
Good.

42:11.827 --> 42:13.127
- He's good. - Yes.

42:16.767 --> 42:18.096
Use your hands a little more.

42:18.466 --> 42:19.497
Big gestures.

42:22.937 --> 42:25.136
He shoots like a real professional.

43:25.526 --> 43:26.596
Stay still.

43:33.607 --> 43:34.607
Young Eun.

43:34.608 --> 43:37.247
I saw the photo you uploaded on your social media page.

43:38.977 --> 43:40.977
Lucky you.

43:41.276 --> 43:43.346
I'm busy mopping the floor.

43:43.716 --> 43:46.587
But you're having fun drinking coffee by the beach.

43:47.287 --> 43:48.957
Yes, I'm depressed.

43:50.627 --> 43:52.026
I think I have menopause.

43:52.327 --> 43:53.595
It's about time.

43:53.596 --> 43:55.227
I heard people age quicker these days.

43:55.627 --> 43:57.425
Yes, I heard. Why can't I look younger instead?

43:57.426 --> 43:59.267
Why do I have to go through menopause?

44:00.566 --> 44:01.596
Hey.

44:02.736 --> 44:06.267
You've become even prettier over the past few days.

44:06.767 --> 44:08.037
Something happened, right?

44:08.406 --> 44:10.377
Who was it? Was he handsome?

44:12.176 --> 44:13.207
It was nothing.

44:13.776 --> 44:16.276
My skin keeps getting saggy with age,

44:16.647 --> 44:18.787
and my body is only getting lazier.

44:19.187 --> 44:21.616
So I just gave myself a little motivation to stay on my toes.

44:21.986 --> 44:23.755
"Keep your game up. Keep yourself together."

44:23.756 --> 44:26.026
"You've still got it." It's my way of telling myself that.

44:26.357 --> 44:28.127
That's just a cunning way of comforting yourself.

44:28.296 --> 44:29.956
I'm just being clever and doing what's best for myself.

44:29.957 --> 44:32.666
It just means you're a single woman who has no one to lean on.

44:32.667 --> 44:34.236
It just means I have a lot of freedom.

44:35.296 --> 44:36.366
I'm so jealous of you.

44:37.107 --> 44:38.136
I know.

44:43.406 --> 44:45.147
Let's move on.

44:49.676 --> 44:50.686
My gosh.

44:50.687 --> 44:52.747
He's not just good.

44:53.386 --> 44:54.917
He might even be better than Mr. J.

44:55.187 --> 44:57.327
Where did you find that guy?

45:06.796 --> 45:08.037
I'm going to do a final retouch.

45:08.696 --> 45:11.037
We don't have time for that. Just have them printed out.

45:12.937 --> 45:16.107
They're my photos. I won't give them to you without my approval.

45:16.337 --> 45:18.806
We have a meeting with an important client.

45:18.807 --> 45:19.946
It'll take only ten minutes.

46:06.426 --> 46:07.557
Here it is.

46:09.696 --> 46:10.696
All done.

46:36.386 --> 46:38.357
Are we done, Ms. Ha?

46:40.827 --> 46:42.656
Yes, let's wrap things up.

46:44.966 --> 46:46.767
You're better than expected.

46:47.096 --> 46:49.767
Did you not have faith in me when you asked me to work part-time?

46:50.096 --> 46:51.506
I had faith in my good eye.

46:52.267 --> 46:53.537
But you turned out to be even better.

46:55.877 --> 46:57.707
Is that a compliment?

46:58.707 --> 46:59.877
Yes, it's a compliment.

47:00.577 --> 47:04.216
I really like your photos.

47:20.796 --> 47:22.736
(Olivier Buyer Show at 5pm)

47:42.917 --> 47:44.255
(Calendar)

47:44.256 --> 47:45.287
(Olivier Buyer Show)

47:49.196 --> 47:50.357
Good work, everyone.

48:01.437 --> 48:02.776
(Ladies and gentlemen.)

48:03.207 --> 48:06.077
(The 2021 Olivier de Saint Sauveur's...)

48:06.546 --> 48:08.747
(FW Buyer Show will now begin.)

48:33.506 --> 48:35.376
The security is going to be strict because nothing's been launched yet.

48:35.377 --> 48:36.807
The moment the designs leak, people will start making copies.

48:37.147 --> 48:39.306
Why did you bring me here? It's only for buyers.

48:39.307 --> 48:41.215
The more you see, the more you'll learn as an artist.

48:41.216 --> 48:42.615
It'll do you good.

48:42.616 --> 48:44.086
Keep a look out for what the buyers like...

48:44.087 --> 48:46.545
and what you think will be in trend next season.

48:46.546 --> 48:49.187
You see? This is how attentive I am.

48:50.417 --> 48:52.457
You were never a guy with pure intentions.

48:53.156 --> 48:54.397
You're clever.

48:55.156 --> 48:56.195
This is a bribe.

48:56.196 --> 48:58.227
It's herbal medicine made in Korea that costs 50 dollars each.

48:59.426 --> 49:01.196
It's expensive. You can have it.

49:02.866 --> 49:06.506
I want to be with you all night.

49:07.307 --> 49:08.337
I'm sorry.

49:08.676 --> 49:10.476
Olivier is a real big shot.

49:10.477 --> 49:11.746
I just wanted to meet him to give him my business card,

49:11.747 --> 49:12.877
but I got rejected.

49:13.147 --> 49:17.986
So I got you a ticket to his after-party.

49:18.216 --> 49:19.287
I'm not going.

49:20.247 --> 49:23.156
He'll be shocked once he finds out that you're my little brother.

49:24.687 --> 49:26.485
I get offered a job,

49:26.486 --> 49:27.957
and now I even have a big brother.

49:28.156 --> 49:29.857
You got a job? What company?

49:31.327 --> 49:32.695
Do you know Hwang Chi Sook who works at The One?

49:32.696 --> 49:34.837
Yes, of course. The One is our client.

49:35.636 --> 49:37.607
By the way, how was the blind date?

49:39.236 --> 49:40.337
Do you think that's funny?

49:40.776 --> 49:42.106
I'll let you off the hook just this once.

49:42.107 --> 49:43.377
Do that one more time, and you'll never see me again.

49:43.577 --> 49:45.306
It won't happen again.

49:45.307 --> 49:46.647
I had to do it for your mother.

49:46.747 --> 49:48.046
Let's go.

50:35.296 --> 50:37.126
(We have a lot of talented artists.)

50:37.127 --> 50:38.425
(I hope we get a chance...)

50:38.426 --> 50:40.365
(to show off Olivier's amazing designs...)

50:40.366 --> 50:42.537
(through collaborations with our Asian stars.)

51:32.687 --> 51:33.747
What is this?

51:34.486 --> 51:37.687
Olivier already signed a contract with Viace.

51:37.957 --> 51:39.556
He was using the photo book as an excuse...

51:39.557 --> 51:41.897
because he didn't know what to say to us.

51:42.057 --> 51:43.556
I thought we were the strongest candidate.

51:43.557 --> 51:45.095
He asked us to bring a photo book.

51:45.096 --> 51:46.997
We went through so much to shoot those photos.

51:48.136 --> 51:49.295
How could he do this to us?

51:49.296 --> 51:50.566
So what's your plan...

51:50.837 --> 51:52.065
and why did you take photos of the undisclosed designs?

51:52.066 --> 51:54.336
I can get back at him by leaking them online.

51:54.337 --> 51:55.976
- Na Ri. - I'll have them copied...

51:55.977 --> 51:57.307
before the weekend's over, and then he'll learn.

51:57.906 --> 51:59.776
How it feels to have your hard work go to waste.

52:02.716 --> 52:04.787
I get how you feel. I really do.

52:05.386 --> 52:06.816
But you're a designer.

52:07.716 --> 52:09.886
You know how fatal it is to have your designs copied.

52:10.216 --> 52:12.925
The entire year's worth of hard work will go down the drain.

52:12.926 --> 52:16.627
You're a designer. You should be the last person to do such a thing.

52:16.857 --> 52:18.796
- But Ms. Ha... - Delete them.

52:19.426 --> 52:21.796
- Ms. Ha. - What makes a luxury brand?

52:22.397 --> 52:26.207
A self-respected designer who prides in his or her designs.

52:27.707 --> 52:29.537
Let's not stoop so low.

52:46.656 --> 52:47.926
Where are you going?

52:49.497 --> 52:50.796
To meet Olivier.

52:51.566 --> 52:54.066
We should at least let him know what he's missing out on.

54:07.066 --> 54:08.307
Hwang Chi Sook?

54:09.077 --> 54:10.905
Goodness, did he just smile?

54:10.906 --> 54:12.607
Why? What does it mean?

54:13.477 --> 54:14.577
Are you okay?

54:15.577 --> 54:18.846
Yes. Did I startle you?

54:24.156 --> 54:25.256
I'm good.

54:41.437 --> 54:43.906
Where in the world is Cookie?

54:44.647 --> 54:46.877
Seok Do Hoon?

56:30.046 --> 56:35.616
(There's nothing I can do. I already signed the contract.)

56:39.426 --> 56:42.196
(But you haven't even looked at our designs.)

56:42.457 --> 56:46.526
(I'd like you to take a look at them and reconsider.)

56:50.767 --> 56:53.106
(Unfortunately, I already made a deal with Viace.)

56:53.107 --> 56:54.937
(We even celebrated with a bottle of champagne.)

56:55.577 --> 56:58.146
(Everything was designed, manufactured, and completed...)

56:58.147 --> 57:00.576
(here in Korea.)

57:00.577 --> 57:05.985
(I can guarantee that we have the best quality products in Korea.)

57:05.986 --> 57:09.457
(Ms. Ha, what are clothes to you?)

57:11.227 --> 57:15.196
(My youth and passion.)

57:17.256 --> 57:21.236
(Although it won't last forever, I want it to be everlasting.)

57:21.796 --> 57:22.837
(What about design?)

57:24.096 --> 57:27.005
(Something I don't want to throw away.)

57:27.006 --> 57:29.776
(It's still a dream of mine.)

57:32.807 --> 57:35.176
(No, it's money.)

57:35.647 --> 57:41.587
(Without money, you can't make or buy clothes.)

57:42.256 --> 57:44.857
(It's cruel, but that's how it is. It's how this industry works.)

57:45.357 --> 57:46.786
(It was a done deal the moment Viace offered to pay...)

57:46.787 --> 57:48.256
(three times the original cost.)

57:51.066 --> 57:55.066
(But your designs aren't so bad.)

58:02.906 --> 58:04.236
(Mr. J.)

58:04.307 --> 58:06.247
(I knew you'd come.)

58:06.546 --> 58:10.176
(Shall we start talking business?)

58:10.517 --> 58:13.386
(It looks like we're already done talking.)

58:13.917 --> 58:15.457
(What? When?)

58:15.957 --> 58:17.057
(Just now.)

58:23.096 --> 58:24.156
(I'm sorry.)

58:25.796 --> 58:29.436
(I thought Mr. Olivier de Saint Sauveur...)

58:29.437 --> 58:31.837
(would appreciate my photos.)

58:32.537 --> 58:34.877
(But I guess I was conceited.)

58:36.176 --> 58:38.807
(What? They were your photos?)

58:39.006 --> 58:40.176
We should go now.

58:40.276 --> 58:42.516
Let me buy you a drink for getting rejected...

58:42.517 --> 58:43.676
by a businessman with horrible taste.

58:45.546 --> 58:46.616
Is that okay with you?

58:47.857 --> 58:50.115
(No, wait.)

58:50.116 --> 58:51.426
(Mr. J, please wait.)

58:53.426 --> 58:55.397
(They were really your photos?)

58:56.057 --> 58:57.397
Oh, my gosh.

59:06.037 --> 59:07.236
You're Mr. J?

59:07.707 --> 59:09.307
You would've known if you had told me your name.

59:11.307 --> 59:12.776
(What's your name?)

59:16.747 --> 59:19.687
(I was wondering how I should address you if we met again.)

59:20.017 --> 59:23.656
The encounters that have no impact mean nothing to me.

59:24.756 --> 59:26.026
Why did you act like you didn't know me?

59:27.256 --> 59:28.827
I didn't think it was necessary.

59:33.866 --> 59:34.897
Ms. Hwang.

59:38.966 --> 59:39.966
Cookie?

59:49.417 --> 59:50.716
The show's over.

59:51.446 --> 59:53.046
I'm heading back to Seoul tomorrow.

59:53.787 --> 59:55.417
Then I'll see you in Seoul.

59:58.127 --> 01:00:00.526
I'm not Hwang Chi Sook.

01:00:01.926 --> 01:00:03.026
I know.

01:00:03.957 --> 01:00:05.066
Ms. Ha Young Eun.

01:00:54.877 --> 01:00:57.646
(Now, We Are Breaking Up)

01:00:57.647 --> 01:00:59.786
He must've liked you.

01:00:59.787 --> 01:01:01.385
It's hard not to like me.

01:01:01.386 --> 01:01:02.715
I'm free until Friday.

01:01:02.716 --> 01:01:03.815
- Who is it? - What?

01:01:03.816 --> 01:01:06.087
This may be a surprise, but go ahead and say hello.

01:01:06.386 --> 01:01:07.826
He's Yoon Jae Guk,

01:01:07.827 --> 01:01:09.655
the son of your father's acquaintance.

01:01:09.656 --> 01:01:12.966
No, he didn't look like this.

01:01:13.167 --> 01:01:15.536
I want Chi Sook to have a big role for the 30th anniversary event.

01:01:15.537 --> 01:01:17.695
- She's Director Hwang. - What a crazy coincidence.

01:01:17.696 --> 01:01:19.406
You always leave after saying your piece.

01:01:19.566 --> 01:01:22.276
I don't want there to be any unnecessary misunderstandings.

01:01:22.377 --> 01:01:23.436
Why are you getting so ahead of yourself?

01:01:23.437 --> 01:01:25.246
I never asked you out or proposed to you.

01:01:25.247 --> 01:01:26.505
- Which way are you headed? - Why?

01:01:26.506 --> 01:01:27.706
So I can go the other way.

01:01:27.707 --> 01:01:29.345
I swear I filed an order to the factory.

01:01:29.346 --> 01:01:31.146
Ms. Ha, how are you going to take care of the mess?

01:01:31.147 --> 01:01:33.545
How will you promote anything without Olivier?

01:01:33.546 --> 01:01:35.516
Did you send invitations to everyone at The One?

01:01:35.517 --> 01:01:36.655
The fit session is tomorrow.

01:01:36.656 --> 01:01:38.456
I'll try to convince him again.

01:01:38.457 --> 01:01:40.086
It just shows that you guys are a domestic brand.

01:01:40.087 --> 01:01:41.996
The event starts in 15 minutes.

01:01:41.997 --> 01:01:43.095
Is the main celebrity coming or not?

01:01:43.096 --> 01:01:44.096
Ms. Shin Yu Jung.

01:01:44.227 --> 01:01:46.327
I'm Ha Young Eun, a team manager at The One.

01:01:46.796 --> 01:01:50.235
Ms. Ha, you're always so versatile and hard-working.

01:01:50.236 --> 01:01:51.806
What happened to the photos?

01:01:51.807 --> 01:01:53.166
Who took this photo?

01:01:53.167 --> 01:01:54.976
It was taken by an unknown photographer.

01:01:54.977 --> 01:01:56.175
The exposure is a mess,

01:01:56.176 --> 01:01:57.976
- and the angle is bad too. - Mr. Yoon.

01:01:57.977 --> 01:01:59.876
I'm in charge of the photoshoot today.

01:01:59.877 --> 01:02:01.445
By any chance, do you know Yoon Soo Wan?

01:02:01.446 --> 01:02:03.115
- I had forgotten about him. - Do you know him?

01:02:03.116 --> 01:02:04.545
I thought I had forgotten all about him.

01:02:04.546 --> 01:02:07.087
But here I am hearing his name again.

01:02:13.587 --> 01:02:18.426
(Now, We Are Breaking Up)
