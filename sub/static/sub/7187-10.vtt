18:53.665 --> 18:55.267
JAKE!

18:56.869 --> 18:57.936
HERE GOES NOTHING.

18:57.936 --> 19:01.240
DRAGON ON THE FIELD!

19:08.780 --> 19:11.783
WHAT'S YOUR HURRY,
HERBIE?

19:16.188 --> 19:18.891
KID, BEHIND YOU!

19:18.891 --> 19:21.193
HUH? OH, GOSH!

19:32.871 --> 19:34.406
SAY WHAT?

19:34.406 --> 19:35.807
[ALL SHOUTING]

19:39.411 --> 19:41.780
JAKE! OH, TALK TO ME.

19:42.347 --> 19:44.149
OH...I GOTTA
GET OUT OF HERE.

19:44.149 --> 19:45.284
I'M GONNA GET HIT
BY A BOULDER

19:45.284 --> 19:47.152
GOING 180
MILES PER HOUR!

19:47.152 --> 19:48.153
HA HA HA HA!

19:48.153 --> 19:49.254
ALREADY HAPPENED,
KID.

19:49.254 --> 19:50.789
HEY, CAN I GET
A LITTLE HELP
OVER HERE?

19:50.789 --> 19:52.691
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT THAT LAST PLAY.

19:52.691 --> 19:55.327
THE BOULDER HERE WAS GOING
180 MILES PER HOUR,

19:55.327 --> 19:58.730
BUT JAKE WAS FLYING
AT A CRUISING SPEED
OF 179.

19:58.730 --> 20:02.968
THAT MAKES THE RELATIVE
SPEED OF THE BOULDER A MERE
ONE MILE AN HOUR,

20:02.968 --> 20:07.105
[CHUCKLING]
NOW, IF IT WAS J.T.'S
BIG BALD HEAD THAT HIT YA,

20:07.105 --> 20:09.208
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
ANOTHER STORY, RIGHT, J.T.?

20:09.208 --> 20:10.442
'CAUSE THAT'S A ROCK.
THAT'S A BIG, HARD--

20:10.442 --> 20:12.344
ALL RIGHT, SMARTY PANTS,
TAKE A WALK.

20:12.344 --> 20:13.845
THANKS FOR SAVING US!

20:13.845 --> 20:14.746
I KNEW YOU WOULD.

20:14.746 --> 20:16.949
I BELIEVE THIS IS YOURS.

20:16.949 --> 20:18.217
I'LL TAKE THAT.

20:18.217 --> 20:21.820
OW! STOP! THAT'S
THE THANKS I GET
FOR SAVING YOUR LIFE?

20:21.820 --> 20:24.056
WELL, IF YOU HADN'T
ABANDONED US IN THE HALLWAY,

20:24.056 --> 20:27.259
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
HAD TO SAVE OUR LIVES
IN THE FIRST PLACE...

20:27.259 --> 20:29.428
NOW THAT WE DON'T
TOTALLY APPRECIATE IT!

20:29.428 --> 20:33.065
I'M JUST SAYING
YOU COULD HAVE CALLED.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.267
I KEPT DINNER WARM
FOR YOU ALL NIGHT.

20:35.267 --> 20:37.502
YO, WHATEVER.
I ATE DINNER AT HOME.

20:37.502 --> 20:42.407
WE NEED TO COMMUNICATE
IF WE WANT THIS THING
TO WORK!

20:42.407 --> 20:48.247
DOES THE RABBIT
GO THROUGH THE HOLE
OR UNDER THE HOLE?

20:48.247 --> 20:52.517
WE'RE TYING THIS THING
IN A KNOT ONCE AND FOR ALL.

20:52.517 --> 20:54.419
HEH. TRIX!

20:54.419 --> 20:56.121
HUH. WE TIED THE KNOT.

20:56.121 --> 20:58.991
THAT'S WHAT ORACLE GIRL
WAS TALKING ABOUT.

20:58.991 --> 21:00.192
HA! WE TIED THE KNOT!

21:00.192 --> 21:02.194
YOU MEAN WE DON'T HAVE TO--

21:02.194 --> 21:03.495
THE WEDDING IS OFF,
DUDETTE!

21:03.495 --> 21:06.398
HEAR THAT,
LADIES OF N.Y.C.?

21:06.398 --> 21:09.501
SPUD IS ONCE AGAIN
A FREE MAN!

21:09.501 --> 21:11.436
MMM. DENZEL, HONEY...

21:11.436 --> 21:14.506
YOU KEEP THE LIGHT ON
FOR MAMA TRIXIE, OK?

21:14.506 --> 21:18.010
DOES THAT MEAN WE DON'T
GET TO GO TO BORA BORA?

21:19.011 --> 21:21.947
SO I GUESS I WASN'T
THE BEST BODYGUARD, HUH?

21:21.947 --> 21:25.050
WELL, YOU DID GIVE UP
YOUR TEST TO SAVE US.

21:25.050 --> 21:26.551
OH, SPEAKING OF THE TEST--

21:26.551 --> 21:30.856
ACTUALLY, EVERYONE'S GONNA
HAVE TO TAKE A WHOLE NEW TEST.

21:30.856 --> 21:33.125
SOMETHING INVOLVING
BAD MEAT LOAF.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.893
UGH. YOU'LL FIND OUT
TOMORROW.

21:34.893 --> 21:36.495
LISTEN, WE OWE YOU ONE.

21:36.495 --> 21:40.399
AND SEE IF ANY VISIONS
FROM THE NEW TEST
HIT US.

21:40.399 --> 21:41.800
THANKS, BUT
NO MORE SHORTCUTS.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.368
I THINK I'LL TAKE CARE OF
THIS ONE MYSELF.

21:43.368 --> 21:45.404
WELL, THANKS FOR RISKING
YOUR LIFE TO SAVE US,

21:45.404 --> 21:47.372
KNOWING YOU WERE GONNA GET HIT
BY THAT BOULDER AND EVERYTHING.

21:47.372 --> 21:51.410
HEY! LIFE'S TOO SHORT
TO LET A LITTLE BAD NEWS
KEEP YOU FROM LIVING.

21:51.410 --> 21:54.313
THAT'S A SUPER DUPER
ATTITUDE!

21:54.313 --> 21:58.950
WHEN YOU FIND OUT
THE DARK, AWFUL TRUTH
ABOUT ROSE.

21:58.950 --> 22:00.519
WELL, HEH HEH, NIGHT!

22:00.519 --> 22:03.455
WHAT? WHAT--WHAT--
WHAT TRUTH?

22:03.455 --> 22:04.923
HEY, GUYS!

22:04.923 --> 22:06.491
GUYS!
