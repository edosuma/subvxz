00:01.970 --> 00:03.719
<b>Previously on Enterprise:</b>

00:04.299 --> 00:07.217
I'm starting to wonder
if the ship even has life support.

00:07.217 --> 00:09.157
They must have atmosphere
on their bridge.

00:09.480 --> 00:13.080
The humans have seen too much.
We can't allow them to escape.

00:15.011 --> 00:18.040
[grunting]

00:21.173 --> 00:23.673
Evasive maneuvers.
Get our people back.

00:23.896 --> 00:27.860
Did we get everyone? Just the MACOs.
Trip, we've lost the transporter.

00:27.860 --> 00:30.595
Sit tight until we come back for you.
Understood.

00:31.952 --> 00:36.602
If this is a Romulan ship, why would they be
stirring up trouble so far from home?

00:37.189 --> 00:42.184
Stay out of this, pinkskin. Shran, listen to me.
The ship that attacked you wasn't Tellarite.

00:42.184 --> 00:43.984
You're both being set up.

00:44.216 --> 00:47.266
Someone didn't want this
conference to go forward.

00:47.990 --> 00:49.040
[groans]

00:51.151 --> 00:54.101
They've entered the bridge.
There's no one here.

01:02.614 --> 01:09.374
[grunting]

01:13.687 --> 01:15.637
They won't last much longer.

01:17.518 --> 01:21.026
[console beeps] It'll have to wait.
We're approaching our next target.

01:21.026 --> 01:23.126
Stabilize the Drone for battle.

01:23.934 --> 01:26.084
Activating the holographic skin.

01:26.678 --> 01:28.378
Use this configuration.

01:29.547 --> 01:34.806
You still in one piece?
I'll let you know when my head stops spinning.

01:37.046 --> 01:38.096
Feel that?

01:38.640 --> 01:41.390
We're dropping out of warp.
Target acquired.

01:41.906 --> 01:43.556
Engage visual sensors.

01:46.360 --> 01:48.410
The Rigellians are hailing us.

01:48.602 --> 01:49.752
Answer them.

01:52.273 --> 01:57.373
We're firing at someone. Well, brace yourself.
Whoever it is, they'll be sure to fire back.

01:58.597 --> 02:01.147
[grunting]
The Drone is taking damage.

02:01.592 --> 02:04.792
Give the Rigellians time
to send their distress call.

02:06.934 --> 02:08.334
[board beeping]

02:10.086 --> 02:12.618
Now...
destroy them.

02:31.637 --> 02:33.520
<i>It's been a long time</i>

02:35.468 --> 02:38.181

02:39.352 --> 02:42.842
<i>And I will see my dream

02:43.746 --> 02:45.946
<i>I will touch the sky</i>

02:47.182 --> 02:50.452

03:43.401 --> 03:45.551
Captain's Starlog, supplemental.

03:45.601 --> 03:50.201
For now, the truce between the Andorians
and Tellarites on Enterprise is holding.

03:50.450 --> 03:53.850
But Starfleet has informed me
of a new diplomatic crisis.

03:54.026 --> 03:57.126
It was a heavily-armed scoutship
with a crew of 17.

03:57.651 --> 03:59.401
There were no survivors.

04:00.184 --> 04:03.946
Why does Starfleet think
this is connected to the other incidents?

04:03.946 --> 04:07.936
The Rigellians transmitted a visual record
of the ship that attacked them.

04:08.264 --> 04:11.814
I'm told their Trade Commission
is demanding compensation...

04:12.234 --> 04:13.484
and my arrest.

04:15.855 --> 04:18.005
Whoever's behind these attacks--

04:18.473 --> 04:22.923
they're trying to do more than provoke a war
between Andorians and Tellarites.

04:22.942 --> 04:26.092
This is an attempt
to destabilize the entire region.

04:27.630 --> 04:30.830
We need to find the marauder
before it attacks again.

04:31.163 --> 04:34.040
I've found a way to detect their warp signature.

04:34.040 --> 04:37.897
And Travis designed a sensor grid
that should extend our range.

04:38.172 --> 04:41.522
How many ships will it take to make this work?
Only 128.

04:46.887 --> 04:50.387
There's just one way
we can get that many ships to help us.

04:57.283 --> 04:58.133
Talas.

05:02.070 --> 05:04.120
Have you come to take me home?

05:04.688 --> 05:09.928
I think this Denobulan doctor
is secretly in love with you.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.627
He wants to keep you to himself.

05:14.540 --> 05:16.790
You said my wound was superficial.

05:18.979 --> 05:20.579
You were only grazed.

05:22.171 --> 05:24.571
But the phase-pistol was set to kill.

05:25.505 --> 05:27.005
That Tellarite pig.

05:28.191 --> 05:29.941
Is there any other kind?

05:31.046 --> 05:34.446
I've seen what phase-pulse infection
can do to Andorians.

05:34.601 --> 05:36.351
You're going to be fine.

05:38.289 --> 05:39.789
We'll be home soon,

05:41.225 --> 05:42.475
the two of us.

05:44.378 --> 05:45.428
[crying]

05:45.976 --> 05:47.876
Don't let me die unavenged.

05:50.524 --> 05:51.474
I won't.

05:55.775 --> 05:56.825
I'm sorry.

05:57.130 --> 05:58.580
She needs to rest.

06:00.152 --> 06:01.502
See what I mean?

06:02.622 --> 06:04.522
He can't get enough of you.

06:08.205 --> 06:09.355
I'm jealous.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.379
Doctor...

06:32.922 --> 06:34.972
How is she?
Lucky to be alive.

06:38.928 --> 06:40.378
I have a proposal.

06:41.461 --> 06:44.511
If it involves killing Tellarites,
I'm all for it.

06:53.786 --> 06:56.086
Your ship is adrift in enemy space,

06:56.125 --> 06:57.875
damaged and defenseless,

06:57.947 --> 07:01.156
because of a single Rigellian scoutship?!

07:01.517 --> 07:04.517
Is that what you want me
to report to the Senate?

07:04.846 --> 07:08.596
The Drone has taken damage before.
It's designed to self-repair.

07:09.075 --> 07:10.875
If our enemies find it...

07:11.495 --> 07:16.045
That's the point of this project!
No prisoners to capture, no bodies to recover.

07:16.548 --> 07:20.644
These Drone ships can never
be traced back to us.

07:20.877 --> 07:22.962
This prototype's a modified warbird.

07:22.962 --> 07:26.883
The Vulcans would identify it the moment
they inspected the propulsion matrix.

07:26.957 --> 07:30.207
The Vulcans won't get anywhere near it.

07:30.207 --> 07:33.209
Don't underestimate our distant brothers.

07:34.353 --> 07:35.953
Bring your ship home.

07:35.991 --> 07:39.240
I'll tell the Senate that your test
has been a success.

07:39.240 --> 07:42.556
Otherwise, they'll make
someone pay for this failure.

07:49.447 --> 07:50.897
And I promise you,

07:50.975 --> 07:52.409
it won't be me.

07:53.435 --> 07:55.356
Jolan true, Admiral.

08:03.786 --> 08:05.536
[door chimes]
Come in.

08:07.587 --> 08:09.236
Admiral Gardner just called.

08:09.236 --> 08:14.551
He's sending every ship available, but at top speed,
it'll take weeks for most of them to get here.

08:14.551 --> 08:17.978
What about Columbia?
She's stuck in dry dock. Engine trouble.

08:17.978 --> 08:22.378
Did you get through to your people?
Minister T'Pau is dispatching 23 vessels.

08:23.759 --> 08:29.510
That's all? The High Command has been disbanded.
Many of our ships no longer have full crew compliments.

08:29.510 --> 08:32.240
T'Pau could have picked a better time
to clean house.

08:33.592 --> 08:38.192
Andorian and Tellarite fleet deployments?
I'm thinking of asking them to join us.

08:39.418 --> 08:43.568
Without more ships,
our center net's going to have a gaping hole.

08:43.568 --> 08:45.834
The marauder could fly right through it,
and we'd never know.

08:45.834 --> 08:50.162
Have you discussed this with Commander Shran?  Or Ambassador Gral?
Not yet.

08:51.198 --> 08:54.498
Even if both sides were to agree,
which seems unlikely,

08:54.604 --> 08:58.892
the deployments would have to be coordinated.
A command hierarchy established.

08:58.892 --> 09:03.377
An Andorian captain might have a problem
taking orders from a Tellarite? Precisely.

09:03.836 --> 09:07.536
There's one species
that's on friendly terms with both of them.

09:07.735 --> 09:08.635
Humans.

09:10.131 --> 09:13.881
Enterprise could serve as the command ship.
Relaying all orders.

09:15.228 --> 09:18.978
The other ships would only have
to exchange communication codes.

09:19.233 --> 09:20.483
It might work.

09:21.294 --> 09:26.222
You don't sound too optimistic. These have four species
have never cooperated on a mutual endeavor.

09:26.222 --> 09:30.072
As far as I know, no one's ever tried
to get them together before.

09:30.091 --> 09:33.035
From what I've heard about these Romulans,
they mean business.

09:33.035 --> 09:38.611
If they're behind these attacks,
we have to find some way to stop them, or next time,

09:39.059 --> 09:41.959
they might come back
with 1,000 of those ships.

09:42.939 --> 09:45.089
Some of these circuits are live,

09:45.546 --> 09:47.796
but I don't know what they're for.

09:47.799 --> 09:52.049
And I can't figure out what half this stuff is.
What about the other half?

09:52.671 --> 09:56.490
Well, I think I've found an environmental system.
That'd make sense.

09:56.490 --> 09:59.410
These consoles look like crew stations.
Here goes.

10:02.792 --> 10:04.321
[rush of air]

10:04.518 --> 10:06.118
Well, how about that.

10:07.970 --> 10:10.620
In a few minutes,
we'll have heat and air.

10:12.886 --> 10:16.323
Do you think it's possible that there's
no one else on board?

10:16.323 --> 10:18.922
Why would a robot ship
have a bridge like this?

10:19.220 --> 10:24.001
Well, it could be a prototype. Outfit an existing ship
with the latest in computer controls.

10:24.001 --> 10:27.561
Well, that'd make things a whole lot easier for us.
How's that?

10:27.561 --> 10:32.605
If this ship's run by computer,
what we need to do is find the "off" switch.

10:34.992 --> 10:37.690
I'd rather cohabit with Klingon targs

10:37.815 --> 10:40.015
than join forces with Tellarites.

10:40.182 --> 10:43.615
Your personal mating preference
is no concern of mine.

10:50.771 --> 10:54.454
If you're waiting for me to stop you,
don't worry, I won't.

10:54.706 --> 10:57.756
You heard what he said.
And I heard what you said.

10:58.973 --> 11:01.973
So now it's time
for both of you to listen to me.

11:06.110 --> 11:09.160
Instead of insulting you
to make you feel at home,

11:09.300 --> 11:12.537
and putting up with your arrogance
as a sign of my respect,

11:12.537 --> 11:15.662
why don't the two of you try behaving
like humans for a change?

11:16.274 --> 11:18.774
And you said
you wouldn't be insulting.

11:27.515 --> 11:31.565
There's one thing humans seem to do
better than any species we've met.

11:32.093 --> 11:34.543
When we're faced
with a common threat,

11:35.381 --> 11:37.331
we put our differences aside

11:37.674 --> 11:39.274
and try to cooperate.

11:43.079 --> 11:44.679
Someone is determined

11:44.941 --> 11:46.991
to start a war in this region.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.765
I've shown you
how we can stop them.

11:50.012 --> 11:53.912
But if you don't understand that,
feel free to strangle each other.

11:55.605 --> 12:00.895
Just remember, that's exactly
what this marauder wants you to do.

12:12.062 --> 12:15.741
We've gone back to warp. Just when it happened,
I got a power spike from one of these conduits.

12:15.741 --> 12:18.192
Do you think warp control runs through here?

12:18.192 --> 12:22.675
If this ship was originally built for a crew,
all of its controls should connect to the bridge.

12:23.168 --> 12:27.118
Maybe they never got disconnected.
Keep your eyes on these consoles.

12:35.211 --> 12:36.561
Did you do that?

12:39.077 --> 12:43.334
Even money we just found the propulsion controls.
What are they doing? I can't tell for sure.

12:43.334 --> 12:45.484
Visual surveillance is off-line.

12:46.509 --> 12:48.759
The Drone is dropping out of warp!

12:50.293 --> 12:54.711
You've found the "off" switch.
All I did was interrupt the power to the warp controls.

12:54.711 --> 12:59.911
There's probably a backup that'll switch on in a few minutes.
Can you make any sense of this?

13:02.050 --> 13:04.200
Where's Hoshi when you need her?

13:05.505 --> 13:07.055
That's where we are.

13:09.443 --> 13:12.769
I'm going to guess
that's the power circuit I just shut down.

13:12.769 --> 13:18.750
If this were Enterprise, that'd be the power coupling
for the entire warp control system, including the backups.

13:23.325 --> 13:25.375
Should be right through there.

13:28.891 --> 13:29.941
Maestro...

13:33.827 --> 13:37.627
One of them's left the bridge.
He's in the service junction. Why?

13:37.644 --> 13:42.444
It appears he's located the main coupling
for the warp matrix. What else is in there?

13:46.359 --> 13:48.840
Just what we need to kill him.

13:51.209 --> 13:54.767
Okay, Malcolm, I'm going to flip through these
like circuit breakers.

13:54.767 --> 13:57.828
Let me know how the diagram changes.
Ready when you are.

13:58.319 --> 13:59.969
There's the first one.

14:01.086 --> 14:02.236
It went out.

14:02.273 --> 14:05.236
He's disabling the warp system.
Is self-repair still activated?

14:05.236 --> 14:08.991
It'll take more than a day to reroute the major circuits.
We don't have a day.

14:10.546 --> 14:12.946
One is still in the service junction.

14:13.552 --> 14:14.702
Seal him in.

14:15.521 --> 14:19.971
I'm going to see if there's a communications circuit we can tap into.
Malcolm!

14:23.626 --> 14:26.376
Malcolm, did you touch something?
Wasn't me.

14:34.567 --> 14:38.817
Do the hatch controls work on your side?
Negative. They're not responding.

14:39.426 --> 14:41.042
[grunting]

14:42.850 --> 14:45.500
Listen carefully, and you won't be harmed.

14:45.994 --> 14:48.144
Who are you?
I control the ship.

14:48.549 --> 14:50.249
Not anymore, you don't.

14:55.385 --> 14:57.335
Commander, what's happening?

14:58.927 --> 15:00.277
Reactor coolant.

15:01.029 --> 15:05.653
Radiation's at 100 roentgens and climbing.
That gives you seven minutes, Commander.

15:05.653 --> 15:09.019
Reestablish the warp matrix,
or you will die.

15:15.485 --> 15:17.735
Compliments of the Imperial Guard.

15:18.348 --> 15:21.820
These are the communication codes
we'll use for the joint operation.

15:21.820 --> 15:25.295
Gral's informed me
that the Tellarites are also taking part,

15:26.181 --> 15:28.531
so they'll need these codes as well.

15:29.500 --> 15:31.050
Do what you have to.

15:31.538 --> 15:35.907
I appreciate your cooperation.
You're not especially difficult to work with, Captain.

15:35.907 --> 15:39.707
Unlike Tellarites, you understand ethics
and try to live by them.

15:40.503 --> 15:41.353
"Try?"

15:41.429 --> 15:43.129
Well, nobody's perfect.

15:44.461 --> 15:46.861
Have you served on all these vessels?

15:47.345 --> 15:49.945
A few of them are a bit before my time...

15:51.379 --> 15:53.384
but they were all named Enterprise.

15:53.384 --> 15:57.455
This one sailed Earth's oceans
almost 400 years ago.

15:57.617 --> 16:03.910
My vessel, the Kumari, was named
for the first ice-cutter to circumnavigate Andoria.

16:05.176 --> 16:08.376
Perhaps future ships will be
named after our vessels,

16:09.364 --> 16:13.367
especially if we do something historic...
together.

16:14.596 --> 16:17.596
There's no reason
our people can't become allies.

16:20.581 --> 16:21.514
Agreed.

16:23.541 --> 16:27.165
Pay attention to that board, Malcolm.
I'm going to try to cut power to the reactor.

16:27.165 --> 16:32.375
I've got a better idea. Make sure you're well away
from the door. You're wasting time, Commander.

16:32.375 --> 16:35.975
The radiation will be fatal in three minutes.
I can save you.

16:44.336 --> 16:47.586
Malcolm, what happened to the board?
Everything's off.

16:48.542 --> 16:50.092
That's more like it.

16:50.667 --> 16:52.217
Radiation's falling.

16:52.354 --> 16:56.204
They've taken the reactor off-line.
Activate the backup sequencer.

17:00.109 --> 17:01.709
I'm still in control.

17:02.476 --> 17:06.988
There is nothing you can do to save your life
except follow my instructions.

17:07.941 --> 17:11.991
We've received the final confirmations.
All 128 ships are in position.

17:13.328 --> 17:15.078
Phlox to Captain Archer.

17:15.224 --> 17:18.575
Go ahead. I require you in Sick Bay
as soon as possible.

17:30.444 --> 17:31.244
No...

17:33.380 --> 17:35.180
I did everything I could.

17:37.175 --> 17:39.460
You said she'd recover.

17:40.933 --> 17:41.883
Shran...

17:59.179 --> 18:02.582
[crying]

18:15.196 --> 18:17.246
Commander, what's your status?

18:17.739 --> 18:21.439
I should've brought my helmet.
Radiation's at 180 and climbing.

18:21.706 --> 18:23.306
I can't shut it down.

18:23.538 --> 18:27.886
You don't have to die like this. You're not getting
this ship back. You're wrong, Commander.

18:27.886 --> 18:31.636
Eventually, it will repair itself.
You'll have died for nothing.

18:32.280 --> 18:33.330
All right.

18:33.439 --> 18:36.089
I'll reconnect the matrix.
Open the hatch.

18:36.474 --> 18:38.132
Malcolm, no!

18:39.798 --> 18:42.388
That's an order!
[panting]

18:46.507 --> 18:47.557
Commander?

18:47.793 --> 18:50.443
Do your duty, Malcolm.
Restore the matrix.

18:50.745 --> 18:52.645
Save your commander's life.

18:59.912 --> 19:05.379
There-- every Tellarite ship is connected to your sensor network,
despite the inefficient Andorian codes.

19:07.371 --> 19:09.121
Now comes the hard part.

19:09.593 --> 19:13.507
We have to sit and wait. [sighs]
We're not a patient people.

19:13.718 --> 19:14.918
I've noticed.

19:16.262 --> 19:20.062
Maybe that's something we can work...
I only want to talk to him!

19:30.314 --> 19:31.864
I only want to talk.

19:39.152 --> 19:40.502
We're listening.

19:51.128 --> 19:57.005
You... need to know about Talas,
the woman you killed.

19:57.005 --> 19:58.354
She attacked us.

19:58.847 --> 20:04.409
The attack was over when you shot her,
but I'm not here to argue that.

20:04.961 --> 20:06.911
Her family was privileged...

20:07.795 --> 20:09.495
...her parents wealthy.

20:09.868 --> 20:11.968
She could've chosen any career,

20:12.439 --> 20:14.222
never known discomfort,

20:15.597 --> 20:17.647
but she felt the call of duty.

20:18.859 --> 20:22.154
She pledged her life
to the Imperial Guard.

20:24.303 --> 20:26.353
Talas could've had anything...

20:28.580 --> 20:29.480
anyone.

20:32.518 --> 20:33.718
She chose me.

20:38.128 --> 20:39.978
I just wanted you to know.

20:50.052 --> 20:51.352
It's her blood.

20:54.285 --> 20:56.635
When a Guardsman dies
far from home,

20:58.108 --> 20:59.508
his companions...

21:02.183 --> 21:03.583
her companions...

21:05.885 --> 21:10.942
carry part of her back to the ice...
of Andoria.

21:16.349 --> 21:18.549
I wanted you to know that, too...

21:19.162 --> 21:20.312
[shouting]

21:21.756 --> 21:23.206
...before you die!

21:23.620 --> 21:26.883
That's enough!
Not until his blood pays for hers!

21:27.293 --> 21:31.518
Keep him away!
You will face justice at my hands!

21:31.518 --> 21:32.853
That's not going to happen on my ship.

21:32.853 --> 21:39.165
Yes, it will, pinkskin, because if you and the Tellarites
don't show respect for Andorian tradition,

21:39.697 --> 21:42.397
the Imperial Guard will withdraw its ships.

21:42.949 --> 21:44.249
What tradition?

21:44.527 --> 21:48.548
Unless this murderer... [growls]
...meets me in combat,

21:49.381 --> 21:52.389
your precious alliance is finished.

21:59.167 --> 22:02.567
I'm reconnecting the warp matrix!
Shut off the radiation!

22:03.135 --> 22:04.735
When you're finished.

22:06.759 --> 22:07.609
There!

22:08.979 --> 22:12.064
Now, shut it off and open this hatch!

22:17.822 --> 22:18.872
Commander!

22:19.064 --> 22:20.264
Stay with me!

22:23.129 --> 22:25.279
The matrix has been reactivated.

22:26.117 --> 22:28.567
Then we don't need the humans anymore.

22:31.748 --> 22:33.698
Why didn't you listen to me?

22:34.343 --> 22:36.943
We're better off here
than on the bridge.

22:41.785 --> 22:43.135
Take it to warp.

22:43.193 --> 22:45.021
Set a course for home.

22:49.286 --> 22:50.786
We're back at warp.

22:51.676 --> 22:53.776
I ordered you not to help them.

22:54.390 --> 22:57.140
I apologize for saving your life, Commander.

22:57.220 --> 22:58.870
It won't happen again.

22:59.239 --> 23:00.089
Sorry.

23:00.478 --> 23:03.978
According to the bridge schematic,
this is an access panel.

23:04.324 --> 23:05.674
Where's it lead?

23:05.713 --> 23:08.513
Away from the bridge.
What does that give us?

23:08.838 --> 23:11.588
We should assume
that we're being monitored.

23:12.838 --> 23:16.138
Did you ever read the manual
that came with that thing?

23:18.071 --> 23:20.571
The warning
about inadvertent overload?

23:22.039 --> 23:25.089
How long does it take?
By now, less than a minute.

23:31.110 --> 23:32.758
What access panel are they talking about?

23:32.758 --> 23:36.229
It leads into the superstructure,
away from any critical equipment.

23:36.702 --> 23:39.452
We'll deal with them
when the Drone returns.

23:59.206 --> 24:03.906
We've got to be a safe distance by now.
I wired it directly into the power conduit.

24:25.721 --> 24:27.221
We've lost contact.

24:34.873 --> 24:38.702
The Andorian tradition Shran wants to follow
is called the Ushaan.

24:38.702 --> 24:41.101
Basically, it's a duel to the death.

24:42.171 --> 24:44.421
The combatants fight with these.

24:45.662 --> 24:47.512
It's called an Ushaan-Tor.

24:48.099 --> 24:51.799
It's an ice-miner's tool.
Andorians play with them as children.

24:52.707 --> 24:57.640
A Tellarite won't stand a chance using one against Shran.
I don't think it's going to be an issue.

24:57.640 --> 25:03.040
Ambassador Gral's refusing to let Naarg fight.
The Andorians will consider that a further insult.

25:05.112 --> 25:07.762
What else do we know
about this tradition?

25:15.214 --> 25:17.264
Please, make yourself at home.

25:22.152 --> 25:23.402
An old friend.

25:24.304 --> 25:25.954
I carry it everywhere.

25:29.944 --> 25:34.306
Two hours ago, we spoke about a new partnership
between Andoria and Earth.

25:34.952 --> 25:36.952
A benefit to both our worlds.

25:38.474 --> 25:41.374
You're throwing it away
for personal vengeance.

25:42.156 --> 25:44.306
There's more to this than Talas.

25:44.588 --> 25:47.825
I lost my ship -- almost my entire crew.

25:48.006 --> 25:51.806
If I do nothing to avenge these losses,
what kind of leader am I?

25:52.167 --> 25:54.667
Why should any soldier
follow me again?

25:57.713 --> 26:00.213
Besides, you should be wishing me luck.

26:02.754 --> 26:06.762
I provide a voice for your species
at the Imperial Guard.

26:07.768 --> 26:09.550
I'm valuable to humans.

26:13.631 --> 26:18.220
I spoke to Ambassador Gral
about the rules of the Ushaan.

26:19.508 --> 26:20.708
Specifically,

26:22.324 --> 26:24.174
the Right of Substitution.

26:27.588 --> 26:31.138
The Ambassador's decided to fight
in place of his underling?

26:34.136 --> 26:35.636
Not the Ambassador.

26:38.569 --> 26:39.769
You wouldn't.

26:40.590 --> 26:42.090
I'm the substitute.

26:43.184 --> 26:46.934
You're going to have to fight me.
I'm going to have to kill you.

26:49.497 --> 26:50.897
You're my friend.

26:51.108 --> 26:52.508
Then call it off.

26:59.416 --> 27:00.366
I can't.

27:03.026 --> 27:06.643
You did all this with one phase-pistol?
You're good at building things.

27:06.643 --> 27:09.343
I'm good at blowing them up.
I'm thinking we should get to the outer hull.

27:09.343 --> 27:12.149
We might be safer trying to find
another area with life-support.

27:12.149 --> 27:14.045
The hull's covered with subspace transceivers.

27:14.045 --> 27:18.584
If I can link one of them to our communicators,
we might be able to contact Enterprise.

27:21.354 --> 27:25.954
Admiral, the Drone has restored contact.
The repair systems are starting to work.

27:26.084 --> 27:27.434
It'll take days.

27:28.293 --> 27:31.843
Let me know when it's restored
its ability to self-destruct.

27:32.547 --> 27:34.297
[door chimes]
Come in.

27:39.038 --> 27:40.538
Updating your will?

27:41.671 --> 27:43.321
You expect me to lose?

27:43.407 --> 27:48.266
Shran is a member of the Imperial Guard,
trained in combat from childhood.

27:49.477 --> 27:50.977
He won't back down.

27:51.121 --> 27:52.121
He can't.

27:53.109 --> 27:54.206
I understand.

27:54.206 --> 27:57.806
If you back down, the Imperial Guard
will withdraw their ships.

27:57.806 --> 28:04.074
If I kill Shran, or one of the Tellarites does,
the Andorians will pull out anyway.

28:05.469 --> 28:09.469
The Tellarites'll do the same thing
if Shran kills one of them, so...

28:12.074 --> 28:16.687
I'm the only one who can be killed
because Starfleet won't withdraw.

28:20.238 --> 28:22.188
This operation is important,

28:22.648 --> 28:26.048
considering that it might lead
to an alliance of planets.

28:28.634 --> 28:32.482
Vulcans have a saying:
"One man can summon the future."

28:34.242 --> 28:38.594
What happens if that man
throws away his life before his time?

28:40.672 --> 28:44.872
If I've learned anything these past few years
on Enterprise, it's that...

28:45.313 --> 28:47.287
the future isn't fixed.

28:48.207 --> 28:50.207
If anything happens to you...

28:51.527 --> 28:54.277
Then I'd better make sure that nothing does.

29:07.031 --> 29:10.781
Didn't expect to find you up this late.
What are you doing here?

29:11.033 --> 29:12.533
Too wired to sleep.

29:12.961 --> 29:16.945
Hard to believe the Captain's going to be fighting
a duel to the death in a few hours.

29:16.945 --> 29:18.695
Barbaric, if you ask me.

29:19.854 --> 29:23.878
What are you looking at? Code of the Ushaan.
T'Pol wants me to go over it again.

29:23.878 --> 29:26.098
See if I can find a way out of this mess.

29:26.559 --> 29:29.814
Last I heard, the Captain sounded determined
to go through with it.

29:29.814 --> 29:31.787
She wants me to find a loophole--

29:31.887 --> 29:35.037
some way to forfeit
without offending the Andorians.

29:37.089 --> 29:39.939
Two of us could get through that a lot faster.

29:43.693 --> 29:44.893
Look at this.

29:45.006 --> 29:50.456
"Either combatant can postpone a duel indefinitely
if there are no children to continue his clan."

29:51.493 --> 29:55.699
How does that help us?
As far as I know, Captain Archer doesn't have any kids.

29:55.699 --> 29:58.363
If he's killed, his clan would die with him.

29:58.404 --> 30:00.904
That rule only applies if he's married.

30:03.015 --> 30:06.049
Don't suppose we can find him a wife
in the next four hours?

30:06.049 --> 30:09.393
Even if we could, something tells me
the Andorians would cry foul.

30:09.724 --> 30:11.174
[sighing softly]

30:11.699 --> 30:14.717
There are 12,000 amendments
to this ridiculous honor code.

30:14.717 --> 30:17.557
There has got to be one
that can get him out of this.

30:18.121 --> 30:20.371
Instead of looking for a loophole,

30:20.499 --> 30:24.195
maybe we should be trying to find a way
for the Captain to win.

30:24.195 --> 30:26.622
If the Captain wins,
Shran is dead.

30:26.659 --> 30:28.459
The alliance falls apart.

30:29.396 --> 30:31.746
Have you ever been to Nobelia Prime?

30:32.545 --> 30:33.745
Not recently.

30:34.908 --> 30:39.499
The tribal elders there-- they can challenge you to a duel
if you look at them the wrong way.

30:39.499 --> 30:42.699
It happened to my father.
How did they get out of it?

30:44.636 --> 30:47.186
Which one of these has the combat rules?

30:51.265 --> 30:54.891
Don't try and block with this.
When he swings, intercept, deflect, and hook it away.

30:54.891 --> 30:59.841
Better to insert between the eyes and twist.
Andorian metabolism is higher than humans'.

30:59.872 --> 31:02.222
Keep moving, and you'll exhaust him.

31:04.254 --> 31:05.854
How about I just win?

31:06.098 --> 31:07.498
Take your places.

31:12.938 --> 31:16.338
There is still time to end this.
It can only end one way.

31:17.391 --> 31:19.241
This is not what I wanted.

31:19.804 --> 31:23.354
Things have a way of turning out
differently than we expect.

31:24.429 --> 31:25.779
I'm glad we met.

31:27.007 --> 31:33.202
In your honor, I'll continue to support cooperation
between the Imperial Guard and your species.

31:34.482 --> 31:36.282
Let's get this over with.

31:36.843 --> 31:38.393
I got a ship to run.

31:46.114 --> 31:48.364
I'll take your blood to Andoria...

31:50.150 --> 31:51.800
to the Wall of Heroes.

31:52.663 --> 31:53.713
Not today.

32:03.246 --> 32:04.996
You have the first move.

32:33.571 --> 32:34.521
Give up.

32:35.027 --> 32:37.627
A single stroke, and there'll be no pain.

32:37.786 --> 32:39.386
You think I'm losing?

32:40.595 --> 32:44.345
I'm just trying to make you look good
in front of your soldiers.

33:02.611 --> 33:04.635
Now do you give up?
Never!

33:05.582 --> 33:06.914
[choking]

33:09.449 --> 33:10.649
Wrong choice.

33:12.730 --> 33:13.830
[choking]

33:15.120 --> 33:17.170
You should've cut off my head.

33:17.545 --> 33:18.995
I considered it...

33:19.669 --> 33:21.569
but I still need your help.

33:21.728 --> 33:22.878
[grunting]

33:26.371 --> 33:27.421
[groans]

33:29.592 --> 33:31.492
What good is a Guardsman...

33:32.361 --> 33:33.961
without two antennae?

33:37.460 --> 33:40.860
[sighs]
You'll begin to compensate within a day or two.

33:41.041 --> 33:43.341
They take nine months to grow back.

33:44.109 --> 33:45.559
If left untreated.

33:46.042 --> 33:51.492
With electrical stimulation and brisk cranial massage,
you'll be back to normal in half that time.

33:51.745 --> 33:55.145
I was told that the loss
of an antenna wasn't critical...

33:56.101 --> 33:57.551
You humiliated me.

33:58.198 --> 34:02.498
...and that the Ushaan is settled
when one fighter is rendered defenseless.

34:04.795 --> 34:05.945
Are we done?

34:08.943 --> 34:11.143
You respected Andorian tradition.

34:13.606 --> 34:14.806
It's settled.

34:15.762 --> 34:17.562
Bridge to Captain Archer.

34:20.891 --> 34:24.190
Four ships have located
the marauder's power signature.

34:24.369 --> 34:26.219
Can you pick up bio-signs?

34:27.338 --> 34:28.938
Not at this distance.

34:30.753 --> 34:33.795
Travis, plot an intercept course.

34:34.400 --> 34:36.150
Take us to maximum warp.

34:37.005 --> 34:38.755
Intercept in 47 minutes.

34:39.858 --> 34:41.208
Alert the fleet.

34:46.510 --> 34:51.560
The Drone's sensors have detected Enterprise.
It's closing. Activate the holographic skin.

34:57.825 --> 35:00.154
Something's starting to draw a lot of power.

35:00.154 --> 35:02.458
It's all those systems
that went down in the explosion.

35:02.458 --> 35:05.213
They're coming back on line.
What about the warp matrix?

35:05.213 --> 35:09.148
Not yet, but if we want to contact Enterprise,
we better hurry.

35:13.269 --> 35:15.069
Approaching visual range.

35:15.847 --> 35:16.897
On screen.

35:18.230 --> 35:19.180
Magnify.

35:20.456 --> 35:21.456
Vulcan...

35:23.647 --> 35:25.597
Check their power signature.

35:26.997 --> 35:29.197
It doesn't match.
Tactical alert.

35:31.622 --> 35:32.922
Charge weapons.

35:34.467 --> 35:38.867
Enterprise will reach the Drone
before the matrix is restored. [doors open]

35:40.637 --> 35:44.010
Senator, I was not told of your visit.

35:44.010 --> 35:47.874
You allowed our enemies to board
and disable the Drone.

35:50.494 --> 35:52.394
I have my sources, Admiral.

35:55.307 --> 35:58.457
Then you know we are
about to engage the human ship.

35:58.994 --> 36:01.597
I'm here to witness its destruction.

36:02.681 --> 36:03.781
One minute.

36:04.338 --> 36:07.041
We have bio-signs. Two humans.

36:07.314 --> 36:09.414
Can you get a transporter lock?

36:11.314 --> 36:13.314
We'll need to be much closer.

36:14.662 --> 36:15.962
Open a channel.

36:18.557 --> 36:20.407
Archer to Tucker and Reed.

36:22.507 --> 36:23.457
Respond.

36:26.873 --> 36:28.673
We're both here, Captain.

36:32.718 --> 36:33.518
Fire.

36:37.588 --> 36:39.088
Target its weapons.

36:39.324 --> 36:41.974
I can't get a lock
through the camouflage.

36:43.568 --> 36:46.668
Take out the emitters,
but don't puncture the hull.

36:53.262 --> 36:55.039
[panting]
[grunting]

36:56.735 --> 37:00.614
They do know we're on board?
They're probably trying to take out the weapons.

37:00.614 --> 37:04.257
Enterprise, any chance of using the transporter?

37:06.617 --> 37:10.667
You have to get closer to the hull.
Can you do that? We're on our way.

37:12.266 --> 37:14.666
We've lost the emitters.
Warp status?

37:14.713 --> 37:15.863
Two minutes.

37:16.294 --> 37:18.294
More enemy ships are closing.

37:18.817 --> 37:22.992
If Enterprise stops the self-repair sequence...
The Drone will escape.

37:31.333 --> 37:33.383
Enterprise, we're at the hull!

37:40.592 --> 37:44.571
The ship's movement is too erratic.
I can't get a lock. They're targeting our warp core.

37:44.571 --> 37:46.221
Hull plating's at 43%.

37:47.800 --> 37:48.900
36 percent.

37:49.316 --> 37:53.316
Shut down weapons. All power to
hull plating. Travis, bring us about.

37:54.843 --> 37:59.873
Trip, Malcolm, we can make one more pass.
Get the hell out of there!

37:59.959 --> 38:01.859
Their weapons are off-line.

38:01.905 --> 38:03.405
They're vulnerable.

38:07.282 --> 38:10.276
I can't imagine
how things could get much worse!

38:11.105 --> 38:11.955
I can!

38:18.675 --> 38:19.925
They're clear.

38:24.558 --> 38:25.958
Sensors are down.

38:27.478 --> 38:28.778
I've lost them.

38:33.221 --> 38:35.471
Six more enemy ships within range.

38:35.739 --> 38:37.239
20 seconds to warp.

38:37.945 --> 38:42.645
We've got company. Alliance ships.
Tell them not to fire. Our people are out there.

38:51.583 --> 38:53.783
The matrix is restored.
Withdraw.

39:10.641 --> 39:11.841
They left us.

39:11.892 --> 39:13.192
You were right.

39:14.116 --> 39:15.366
This is worse.

39:15.862 --> 39:17.862
Anyone out there need a lift?

39:28.875 --> 39:31.875
If I had to wear this helmet
for one more minute,

39:31.918 --> 39:34.368
I swear it would've fused to my skull.

39:34.633 --> 39:35.733
I tell you,

39:35.885 --> 39:40.235
I'd like to find the designer of this suit,
make him wear it for three days.

39:41.687 --> 39:45.041
Thanks for what you did back there.
Oh, you would've done the same for me.

39:45.041 --> 39:46.991
No, you took a big chance...

39:47.990 --> 39:51.190
which makes what I have to do
all the more difficult.

39:53.169 --> 39:55.019
I'm putting you on report.

39:56.315 --> 39:57.465
You're what?

39:57.736 --> 39:59.736
You disobeyed a direct order.

39:59.846 --> 40:01.296
I saved your life!

40:03.055 --> 40:09.820
If you put a reprimand in my file, it could be years
before I'm even eligible for... [chuckling]

40:11.771 --> 40:13.471
Are you pulling my leg?

40:15.697 --> 40:17.847
You're just such an easy target.

40:31.476 --> 40:33.126
The marauder got away.

40:35.634 --> 40:37.934
One of the Tellarite ships was hit.

40:38.037 --> 40:41.530
An Andorian warship...
rescued the crew.

40:41.741 --> 40:42.541
So...

40:43.028 --> 40:44.628
it's still out there.

40:44.945 --> 40:47.045
As you said, "a common threat."

40:47.496 --> 40:50.746
I believe we have more
to discuss than trade disputes.

40:59.280 --> 41:01.380
Why wait until we get to Babel?

41:26.750 --> 41:29.200
The Drone has reentered Romulan space.

41:30.269 --> 41:31.869
Disconnect the pilot.

41:32.305 --> 41:38.660
