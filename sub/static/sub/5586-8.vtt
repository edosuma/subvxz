get ahold of one of these?

00:10.010 --> 00:11.881
Oh...

00:11.968 --> 00:13.230
Do you have any idea
what could happen

00:13.317 --> 00:14.797
if you play around
with one of these?

00:14.884 --> 00:17.321
Look. See?

00:17.408 --> 00:18.931
This isn't a game.

Hi, hon. How was your day?

01:10.548 --> 01:12.855
It is Big Super Crazy Days
at the Lucky Aide.

01:12.942 --> 01:15.553
I feel like I have
been hit by a truck.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.599
Oh, here's your
herbal tea.

01:17.686 --> 01:20.254
[sighs] The thing is,
absolutely nothing is on sale.

01:20.341 --> 01:22.256
They take all the stuff
off the shelves,

01:22.343 --> 01:24.258
dump it in the bins
and the people go nuts.

01:24.345 --> 01:25.781
I dropped my car keys
in one of 'em.

01:25.868 --> 01:27.217
I had to wrestle a woman
for 20 minutes

01:27.304 --> 01:29.263
-to get 'em back.
-[beeping]

01:29.350 --> 01:31.352
Oh, God, my neck
is killing me.

01:31.439 --> 01:33.093
Got it.

01:33.180 --> 01:34.355
And then this 90-year-old man
with glaucoma comes in.

01:34.442 --> 01:35.356
He wants to pay
for his toiletries

01:35.443 --> 01:36.400
with a bag full of pennies.

01:36.487 --> 01:38.010
Feet up.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.882
We finally settled on
five dollars, six buttons,

01:39.969 --> 01:41.536
and a run-over bottle cap.

01:41.623 --> 01:42.841
Feet down.

01:43.929 --> 01:45.627
[sighs]

01:45.714 --> 01:48.412
I swear, Hal, I could hardly
stand up through my shift.

01:48.499 --> 01:49.892
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to break down

01:49.979 --> 01:51.720
and buy those custom
orthotics for my shoes.

01:51.807 --> 01:54.636
Dr. Fletcher said I've got
the pronation of a circus clown.

01:54.723 --> 01:56.028
Well, if you need 'em,
you need 'em.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.726
That's all there is to it.

01:57.813 --> 02:00.032
That right heel looks
like it could use some pumice.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.122
Hal, what would
I do without you?

02:02.209 --> 02:03.732
I swear I couldn't
make it through the day

02:03.819 --> 02:04.994
if you weren't here
to pick up the pieces

02:05.081 --> 02:06.169
and put me back
together again.

02:06.256 --> 02:07.605
Oh, nonsense, honey.

02:07.692 --> 02:09.216
I'm only doing
what any husband would do.

02:09.303 --> 02:11.000
-Any husband who cares.
-[blows]

02:11.087 --> 02:13.002
There.
Back in.

02:13.089 --> 02:14.612
Now if you'll lean forward,

02:14.699 --> 02:15.700
I'll get that spot between
your shoulder blades.

02:15.787 --> 02:17.311
Actually, that's the one
part of me

02:17.398 --> 02:18.529
that doesn't hurt today.

02:18.616 --> 02:20.270
Really?

02:21.576 --> 02:23.099
Did I mention
the washer is out again?

02:23.186 --> 02:24.535
-Oof!
-I got it.

02:24.622 --> 02:25.754
Ohh...

02:27.843 --> 02:30.498
It's not fair.
You owe me ten dollars, Malcolm.

02:30.585 --> 02:32.717
You promised to pay me back
a month ago.

02:32.804 --> 02:34.763
Dewey, it seems to me you're
the only one holding onto this.

02:34.850 --> 02:37.157
The rest of us have moved on.

02:37.244 --> 02:38.984
Yeah, you
keep hounding people,

02:39.071 --> 02:40.464
Pretty soon, no one's going to
want to borrow money from you.

02:40.551 --> 02:43.119
He's isolated
one-on-one. He fakes.

02:43.206 --> 02:44.555
He fakes again.
A behind-the-back pass to...

02:44.642 --> 02:46.644
-Oh!
-[gasping]

02:46.731 --> 02:48.777
Uh-oh.

02:48.864 --> 02:51.214
Do you get points
for missing your mom's head?

02:59.222 --> 03:01.398
Ah, that rim's a little loose.

03:02.312 --> 03:03.748
Mom, how did you do that?

03:03.835 --> 03:04.880
Orthotics, boys.

03:04.967 --> 03:06.751
They can change your life.

03:06.838 --> 03:10.407
Give me a hand
with the groceries, Malcolm.

03:10.494 --> 03:12.104
I might as well.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.194
I don't think I'll be playing
basketball ever again.

03:18.067 --> 03:19.677

03:22.419 --> 03:23.899
I've been waiting
to get you alone,

03:23.986 --> 03:26.597
you miserable, scum-sucking
piece of garbage.

03:26.684 --> 03:28.947
Short Stack, is that you?

03:30.906 --> 03:32.473
I don't believe it!

03:32.560 --> 03:34.518
What the hell are you
doing here, you ugly grub eater?

03:34.605 --> 03:36.041
-[laughs]
-I had a few days' leave.

03:36.128 --> 03:37.434
Thought I'd spend it
with my favorite idiot.

03:37.521 --> 03:38.696
Who's this?

03:38.783 --> 03:40.350
Only my best buddy
from the army.

03:40.437 --> 03:41.830
Remember that story I told
about that girl soldier

03:41.917 --> 03:43.397
who went all crybaby

03:43.484 --> 03:45.137
when she got her first
care package from home?

03:45.225 --> 03:46.748
Abby's the one that kicked her
ass and made her shut up.

03:46.835 --> 03:48.619
It was what any platoon leader
would have done.

03:48.706 --> 03:50.882
I'm Abby Tucker.
It's nice to meet you.

03:50.969 --> 03:52.580
I'm Lois. This is Malcolm.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.277
Oh, right, Pea Pod.

03:54.364 --> 03:55.844
I see what you mean.

03:55.931 --> 03:57.628
So, you're a platoon leader.

03:57.715 --> 03:59.151
It's nice the army
lets a woman

03:59.239 --> 04:00.762
have some authority
once in a while.

04:00.849 --> 04:02.590
Yes, ma'am... although it
does feel a little weird

04:02.677 --> 04:03.982
to give orders to men.

04:04.069 --> 04:06.289
Well, it shouldn't.
Men are like dogs.

04:06.376 --> 04:08.030
It calms them down when they
know their boundaries.

04:08.117 --> 04:09.684
REESE: Look, if you don't mind,
she's only got

04:09.771 --> 04:11.120
a couple free days,
and we've got, like,

04:11.207 --> 04:12.121
a ton of catching up to do.

04:12.208 --> 04:13.818
Sure.

04:13.905 --> 04:16.517
[both grunting]

04:22.000 --> 04:24.612
I want my money.
I want my money.

04:24.699 --> 04:26.004
I want my money.

04:26.091 --> 04:28.703
I want my money.
I want my money.

04:28.790 --> 04:30.748
Dewey! I heard you
the first 500 times.

04:30.835 --> 04:31.793
Just shut up.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.838
Okay.

04:33.925 --> 04:35.405
DEWEY [OVER CASSETTE PLAYER]:
I want my money.

04:35.492 --> 04:37.277
I want my money.
I want my money.

04:37.364 --> 04:39.279
You know, you're right.

04:39.366 --> 04:40.802
I wasn't being fair to you.

04:40.889 --> 04:42.194
A deal's a deal.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.848
I've been saving
all this stuff for you

04:43.935 --> 04:46.155
for a special occasion.

04:46.242 --> 04:48.592
But today's as good a day
as any.

04:48.679 --> 04:50.202
Happy Dewey day.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.813
You're giving me garbage.

04:51.900 --> 04:53.684
Hey, I once lent
five bucks to Francis,

04:53.771 --> 04:55.338
and all I got
was a double-dip swirly.

04:55.425 --> 04:56.687
Consider yourself lucky.

04:58.863 --> 04:59.908
[sniffing]

04:59.995 --> 05:02.084
Hi, honey, sorry I'm late.

05:02.171 --> 05:06.436
I had to stop by and pick up
this puppy on my way home.

05:06.523 --> 05:08.525
Why don't you rub yourself
up against this for a while,

05:08.612 --> 05:11.311
while I get
your foot bath ready.

05:11.398 --> 05:13.051
I'm making a small
adjustment on the pH,

05:13.138 --> 05:16.533
which I think you're going
to find especially refreshing.

05:16.620 --> 05:17.926
Hal, you can forget
about all that.

05:18.013 --> 05:20.015
I wore my new
orthotics today.

05:21.103 --> 05:22.017
See?

05:22.104 --> 05:23.975
It was miraculous.

05:24.062 --> 05:27.849
All the pain and tension
disappeared everywhere.

05:27.936 --> 05:29.546
It was like once my feet
were properly supported,

05:29.633 --> 05:31.026
the rest of my body
fell in line

05:31.113 --> 05:32.810
like a family of ducks.

05:32.897 --> 05:34.943
Well, how about that?

05:35.030 --> 05:38.686
So, I guess Crazy Days have
quieted down a little, huh?

05:38.773 --> 05:40.078
Are you kidding?

05:40.165 --> 05:41.515
Today we started
After Crazy Day Sale.

05:41.602 --> 05:42.690
It was wild.

05:42.777 --> 05:44.213
And wouldn't you know,

05:44.300 --> 05:45.910
the old blind guy
with the pennies was back.

05:45.997 --> 05:48.565
He has the most delightful
stories about his health.

05:48.652 --> 05:51.960
Did you know that men
can get yeast infections?

05:52.047 --> 05:53.657
Imagine that.

05:53.744 --> 05:54.789
So, honey, you can put
all that paraphernalia away.

05:54.876 --> 05:56.051
I don't need it anymore.

05:56.138 --> 05:57.444
Isn't that wonderful?

05:57.531 --> 05:59.054
Yeah. I could-couldn't
be happier, hon.

05:59.141 --> 06:01.361
[bell dings]

06:01.448 --> 06:02.666
Shut up.

06:05.408 --> 06:07.062
Are you absolutely sure

06:07.149 --> 06:08.542
you don't want to sleep
inside tonight?

06:08.629 --> 06:09.891
Ma'am, your backyard
is more than adequate.

06:09.978 --> 06:10.935
Oh, and you folks
don't have to worry

06:11.022 --> 06:12.415
about that possum any longer.

06:12.502 --> 06:14.678
Oh, well, thanks.

06:14.765 --> 06:18.334
I have to confess, I'm a great
admirer of yours, ma'am.

06:18.421 --> 06:20.467
-Me?
-Yes, ma'am. [chuckles]

06:20.554 --> 06:22.730
Reese told me so many
amazing stories about you.

06:22.817 --> 06:24.427
Is it true
you once made him

06:24.514 --> 06:26.473
cut the front lawn with a pair
of manicure scissors?

06:26.560 --> 06:28.213
I can't take all
the credit for that.

06:28.300 --> 06:31.042
After all, he was the one who
didn't refill the ice cube tray.

06:31.129 --> 06:33.523
Malcolm, Reese,
get the lead out!

06:41.836 --> 06:42.924
[grunts]

06:43.011 --> 06:44.578
[grunting]

06:44.665 --> 06:46.493
Say it, or I'll
lick your ear!

06:46.580 --> 06:49.931
I'm a worthless sack of pus,
and I will always be your bitch!

06:50.018 --> 06:52.237
You know it's true,
but it's still nice

06:52.324 --> 06:53.848
to hear once
in a while.

06:53.935 --> 06:55.937
So, is the latrine free?

06:56.024 --> 06:57.373
I think Dewey's
still using it.

06:57.460 --> 06:59.331
That's okay. I dug my own.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.290
Wow.

07:01.377 --> 07:03.161
So when are you guys
going to hook up

07:03.248 --> 07:04.467
and get it over with?

07:04.554 --> 07:06.469
What? What are you
talking about?

07:06.556 --> 07:08.602
Oh, come on.
Every time I turn around,

07:08.689 --> 07:10.299
she's got her hands
all over you.

07:10.386 --> 07:11.866
She clearly digs you, dude.

07:11.953 --> 07:13.128
You take that back.

07:13.215 --> 07:14.651
What's your problem?

07:14.738 --> 07:16.436
I mean, I wouldn't
turn my back on her,

07:16.523 --> 07:18.133
but I think
she's kind of hot.

07:18.220 --> 07:19.613
No, she isn't.

07:19.700 --> 07:20.875
Buddies can't be hot.

07:20.962 --> 07:22.790
I don't believe you.

07:22.877 --> 07:24.618
The best friend I
ever had wakes me up

07:24.705 --> 07:26.794
in the middle of the night,
gives me a stinging face fart,

07:26.881 --> 07:28.926
and you go and turn it
into something ugly!

07:31.363 --> 07:34.018
I sold those comics
you gave me.

07:34.105 --> 07:35.411
Turns out
they're pretty crappy.

07:35.498 --> 07:37.021
Dewey, we're done with this.

07:37.108 --> 07:40.590
In fact, Captain Danger 243
even had a misprint.

07:40.677 --> 07:42.157
Funny how people
in the comic world

07:42.244 --> 07:44.028
are very interested
in misprints.

07:44.115 --> 07:45.726
Especially when
there's only five such copies

07:45.813 --> 07:47.292
in existence,
and Quentin Tarantino

07:47.379 --> 07:49.425
has the other four.

07:49.512 --> 07:50.774
What are you talking about?

07:50.861 --> 07:53.516
Is it hot in here,
or is just money?

07:53.603 --> 07:55.692
Oh, my God, this is fantastic!

07:55.779 --> 07:58.173
Who knew we were sitting
on such a gold mine here?

07:58.260 --> 08:00.654
We? I don't think so.

08:00.741 --> 08:02.220
Dewey... you didn't think

08:02.307 --> 08:04.614
the whole garbage thing
was for real, did you?

08:04.701 --> 08:06.050
You told me I should be happy
with what you gave me,

08:06.137 --> 08:08.444
and I have to say I am.

08:08.531 --> 08:10.751
Here's 20 bucks.
Make yourself scarce.

08:10.838 --> 08:12.056
What? This is my room.

08:12.143 --> 08:14.363
You can't buy me
out of here for 20 bucks.

08:14.450 --> 08:15.799
How's $40?

08:15.886 --> 08:18.498
Forget it! I'm not... Okay.

08:20.761 --> 08:22.719
I'll be damned
if I'm gonna call

08:22.806 --> 08:24.721
that washing machine
repairman again.

08:24.808 --> 08:27.115
I could only find the Japanese
version of the manual,

08:27.202 --> 08:29.247
but I think I get
the gist of it.

08:29.334 --> 08:30.901
It's all taken care of, honey.

08:30.988 --> 08:32.294
What? What do you mean?

08:32.381 --> 08:33.337
After dinner,
I felt so energized,

08:33.424 --> 08:34.557
I thought I'd take a look.

08:34.644 --> 08:36.037
Turns out one
of Jamie's toys

08:36.124 --> 08:37.604
was jammed between the drum
and the housing.

08:37.691 --> 08:39.214
Isn't it wonderful

08:39.301 --> 08:40.650
I don't have to bother you
with all this anymore?

08:40.736 --> 08:42.870
[spraying]

08:49.050 --> 08:51.182
Well, that's strange.

08:51.269 --> 08:52.619
What's that, dear?

08:52.706 --> 08:54.185
My orthotics-- they were
right here in my shoes.

08:54.272 --> 08:55.447
I left them there last night.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.710
Where could they be?

08:56.797 --> 08:58.363
Beats me... unless...

08:58.450 --> 08:59.756
Wait a minute.

08:59.843 --> 09:01.889
Oh, for the love of...
that darn kid!

09:01.976 --> 09:03.586
Who?

09:03.673 --> 09:05.022
Jamie. See, there's a
little piece of jelly

09:05.109 --> 09:06.850
on the back of the
shoe-- see that?

09:06.937 --> 09:09.679
We have to face it, Lois:
we are raising a klepto.

09:09.766 --> 09:10.985
What would he want
with my orthotics?

09:11.072 --> 09:12.290
Who knows?

09:12.377 --> 09:13.988
Yesterday, he took
the last donut.

09:14.075 --> 09:17.426
Well... I doubt we'll ever
see those orthotics again.

09:17.513 --> 09:20.124
Oh, and just when you
were feeling so good.

09:20.211 --> 09:24.302
Oh! Why, God, why does this
always happen to us?

09:24.389 --> 09:26.870
Why can't we just once
catch a break?

09:27.697 --> 09:29.830
You did have them.

09:31.701 --> 09:33.268
Why are they
covered in dirt?

09:33.355 --> 09:35.313
Did you bury them,
you little devil?

09:36.576 --> 09:39.709
Isn't he a clever kid?
[whimpering softly]

09:40.710 --> 09:42.364
[car approaches]

09:43.974 --> 09:45.889
Well, thanks again
for the company,

09:45.976 --> 09:48.326
although I still don't know
what you find so fascinating

09:48.413 --> 09:50.285
about my job at the Lucky Aide.

09:50.372 --> 09:51.765
Are you kidding?

09:51.852 --> 09:53.810
The way you handled
that unruly mob

09:53.897 --> 09:55.333
without once firing
over their heads.

09:55.420 --> 09:57.074
You are incredible.

10:02.297 --> 10:03.994
So, you wanna
do some buddy stuff?

10:04.081 --> 10:05.735
You know, wrestle,
horse around?

10:05.822 --> 10:07.650
No funny business,
no strings attached?

10:07.737 --> 10:10.000
Yeah, sure.
Just give me a second.

10:10.087 --> 10:11.741
What are you doing that for?

10:11.828 --> 10:13.047
My lips are a little bit
chapped. Here, you want some?

10:13.134 --> 10:15.049
[gasps]

10:15.136 --> 10:17.051
What else did you buy?

10:17.138 --> 10:19.053
Shampoo and nail files,
some Q-tips. Why?

10:19.140 --> 10:20.750
You don't have
to get all fem on me!

10:20.837 --> 10:22.404
What's the matter, big dog?

10:22.491 --> 10:23.623
Afraid I can't take you anymore?

10:24.928 --> 10:26.190
What's wrong, Reese?

10:26.277 --> 10:27.931
We have to get some stuff
out in the open.

10:28.018 --> 10:29.454
Punch me if I'm wrong,

10:29.541 --> 10:30.978
but there's something
in the air around here

10:31.065 --> 10:32.414
that smells a whole lot more
than friendship.

10:33.241 --> 10:34.634
[sighs]

10:34.721 --> 10:36.418
God, am I that obvious?

10:36.505 --> 10:37.767
So it's true?

10:37.854 --> 10:39.247
Don't be mad, Reese.

10:39.334 --> 10:41.684
I swear I did not intend
for this to happen.

10:41.771 --> 10:43.599
It's just a silly
schoolgirl crush,

10:43.686 --> 10:45.340
and I know it
won't go anywhere.

10:45.427 --> 10:46.515
I'm sorry.

10:46.602 --> 10:48.082
The last thing
I want to do

10:48.169 --> 10:50.040
is make you
uncomfortable.

10:50.127 --> 10:52.216
Am I making you
uncomfortable, Reese?

10:52.303 --> 10:53.740
No, it's cool.

10:53.827 --> 10:55.916
It's nothing
I can't handle.

10:56.003 --> 10:57.831
[sighs]
That's good.

11:02.487 --> 11:04.446
[sighs]

11:06.404 --> 11:08.363
LOIS:
I need someone to dry.

11:08.450 --> 11:10.191
Yes, ma'am.

11:10.278 --> 11:12.889
Damn! I never
should have let her

11:12.976 --> 11:15.413
see me in my bike shorts.

11:24.161 --> 11:25.206
[TV channel changes]

11:25.293 --> 11:26.686
Hold it.

11:28.165 --> 11:30.124
You're not going
anywhere.

11:31.299 --> 11:32.909
You don't even like this show.

11:32.996 --> 11:35.303
What's more important is,
you don't either.

11:35.390 --> 11:36.304
MAN [ON TV]:
All right, kids, Charlie,
Raphael, let's sing along.

11:36.391 --> 11:38.828
Ooh, good, a sing-a-long.

11:38.915 --> 11:41.352
Nice and loud now.

11:43.311 --> 11:45.835
Have I told you how much I

11:45.922 --> 11:48.272
love my orthotics?

11:48.359 --> 11:50.144
Yes.

11:50.231 --> 11:53.060
You made up a little song
about them at dinner, remember?

11:53.147 --> 11:54.583
Are you coming to bed?

11:54.670 --> 11:56.759
Oh, I can't.
I'm just too up to sleep.

11:56.846 --> 11:59.936
Well, if you're really looking
to release some tension,

12:00.023 --> 12:02.199
I guess there's something
I could do for you.

12:02.286 --> 12:05.028
If you ask nicely.

12:05.115 --> 12:07.422
Hal, you are sweet, but I'm
going to take a rain check.

12:07.509 --> 12:08.815
I'm jogging on down

12:08.902 --> 12:10.294
to the high school
to run a few laps.

12:10.381 --> 12:11.469
Hold these while
I get my running shoes.

12:24.395 --> 12:26.789
[groaning softly]

12:47.114 --> 12:48.376
Okay, you're done.

12:48.463 --> 12:50.247
The school day's
officially over.

12:51.118 --> 12:52.119
[sighing]

12:53.816 --> 12:56.210
This was worth way more
than $45.

12:56.297 --> 12:57.646
You know, I have to agree.

12:57.733 --> 13:00.301
So tomorrow we'll
go with Mom's earrings

13:00.388 --> 13:01.868
and something that shows off
your figure.

13:01.955 --> 13:03.304
No, I'm done with this.

13:03.391 --> 13:04.435
I'm not going to humiliate
myself anymore

13:04.522 --> 13:06.307
for money that's
rightfully mine.

13:06.394 --> 13:08.178
Then you'll never know
how much you could have had.

13:08.265 --> 13:09.440
Trust me, I really don't care.

13:09.527 --> 13:11.181
-Not at all?
-No.

13:11.268 --> 13:12.835
Not even
to the nearest thousand?

13:14.228 --> 13:15.751
Thousand?

13:15.838 --> 13:17.361
Nah, you're right.
It's getting kind of boring.

13:17.448 --> 13:19.711
I'm sure I can find
some other way to torment you.

13:19.799 --> 13:20.800
No! No!

13:20.887 --> 13:22.149
This is working out great.

13:22.236 --> 13:23.585
Look, I'm even
breaking out in hives.

13:23.672 --> 13:25.326
You don't want
to throw that away.

13:25.413 --> 13:27.807
I got it. How about I go walking
through the mall tomorrow

13:27.894 --> 13:30.374
wearing swim fins
and goggles.

13:30.461 --> 13:32.899
We'll see.

13:32.986 --> 13:34.596
[sighs]

13:40.689 --> 13:41.951
How long have you
been here?

13:42.038 --> 13:43.866
Since last night.

13:43.953 --> 13:45.694
To be honest, I'm a little hurt
that no one seemed to miss me.

13:45.781 --> 13:47.391
-Is this about Abby?
-You were right, Malcolm.

13:47.478 --> 13:48.697
She wants me bad.

13:48.784 --> 13:50.655
This is a disaster.

13:50.742 --> 13:52.179
Why?

13:52.266 --> 13:53.789
You've got a girl
that's crazy about you.

13:53.876 --> 13:54.790
But it's just wrong.

13:54.877 --> 13:56.009
She's my buddy.

13:56.096 --> 13:57.967
The best friend
I've ever had.

13:58.054 --> 13:59.360
But in a roll around
on the floor

13:59.447 --> 14:00.883
and make her smell my armpit
kind of way.

14:00.970 --> 14:02.798
Everyone has their own
kind of foreplay.

14:02.885 --> 14:05.757
The important thing now
is how you feel about her.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.847
It's hard to say.
Now when I think about her,

14:07.934 --> 14:09.370
I get all nervous
in my stomach.

14:09.457 --> 14:11.546
Like my bowels could cut loose
at any moment.

14:11.633 --> 14:13.243
That's love, dude.

14:13.330 --> 14:15.115
Wow.

14:15.202 --> 14:18.161
You'd think somebody
would put that in a song.

14:18.248 --> 14:19.336
Listen, I know we've
had our differences,

14:19.423 --> 14:20.816
but I say this
as a brother.

14:20.903 --> 14:22.687
You're not that great a catch.

14:22.774 --> 14:23.819
This girl might be

14:23.906 --> 14:25.647
the best shot you'll ever get.

14:25.734 --> 14:27.388
You need to suck it up and at
least tell her how you feel.

14:27.475 --> 14:29.172
Otherwise, you might end up
looking like an idiot.

14:30.478 --> 14:33.002
Do we still have the skirt
that goes with these?

14:36.440 --> 14:37.964
[metal clanging]

14:38.051 --> 14:40.575
LOIS: Who's the lamebrain
who left the trash cans

14:40.662 --> 14:42.533
in the middle
of the driveway?!

14:42.620 --> 14:44.448
Yes!

14:44.535 --> 14:45.928
Oof...

14:47.495 --> 14:48.800
I hate these things.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.672
Oh, honey, what happened?

14:50.759 --> 14:52.761
I was standing at
my cash register

14:52.848 --> 14:54.937
putting up these cute
little butterfly decals,

14:55.024 --> 14:57.897
when suddenly, I got the most
excruciating cramp in my leg.

14:57.984 --> 15:00.116
-Oh...
-It was like that time
Francis chomped down on me,

15:00.203 --> 15:02.205
only I couldn't
turn the hose on it.

15:02.292 --> 15:03.685
You know, if they're going

15:03.772 --> 15:05.208
to fix one problem
and just cause another,

15:05.295 --> 15:06.644
I don't want any part of them.

15:06.731 --> 15:07.950
Why don't I get
the footbath ready?

15:08.037 --> 15:09.299
It's my own damn fault
for thinking

15:09.386 --> 15:11.388
there was a magic pill
to give me my life back.

15:11.475 --> 15:13.564
I should have known
it was too good to be true.

15:13.651 --> 15:15.349
You can't trust the banks.

15:15.436 --> 15:16.567
You can't trust your own kids.

15:16.654 --> 15:19.527
And you obviously cannot
trust doctors.

15:19.614 --> 15:22.660
God, Hal, you're the only person
I still have to believe in.

15:22.747 --> 15:24.445
I'm so happy
I can still trust you.

15:24.532 --> 15:25.489
[door opens]

15:25.576 --> 15:27.317
Oh. Sorry.

15:27.404 --> 15:28.840
I was looking
for Reese.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.799
Well, if the refrigerator
door isn't open,

15:30.886 --> 15:32.105
he's probably not home.

15:32.192 --> 15:33.323
Hal, get rid of these.

15:33.410 --> 15:35.021
I'm gonna try
to walk it off.

15:35.108 --> 15:36.718
Well, honey, you know,
it may not be all their fault.

15:36.805 --> 15:37.980
I've made up my mind.

15:38.067 --> 15:39.939
I do not want them anymore.

15:41.897 --> 15:44.987
Looks like a mild strain
of the gastrocnemius.

15:45.074 --> 15:47.511
Used to see it
all the time in boot camp.

15:47.598 --> 15:50.210
Uh, you might want
to try massaging that muscle.

15:50.297 --> 15:51.559
You think so?

15:51.646 --> 15:53.430
Well, I'd be happy
to do it for you.

15:53.517 --> 15:54.518
Oh, would you?

15:54.605 --> 15:56.390
Abby, that would be great.

15:56.477 --> 15:59.045
[groans]

15:59.132 --> 16:01.177
Go ahead.
Don't be timid.

16:01.264 --> 16:03.397
[sighs]

16:03.484 --> 16:05.660
No, really... dig in.

16:06.617 --> 16:08.706
Oh, yeah!

16:08.793 --> 16:11.579
Oh, God, that's the spot.

16:11.666 --> 16:15.496
Oh! Oh.

16:15.583 --> 16:17.411
Oh, yes.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.066
Yes.

16:20.153 --> 16:21.632
Don't stop.

16:21.719 --> 16:23.808
That's it.

16:23.895 --> 16:26.246
That's a little high.

16:28.639 --> 16:31.468
I'm sorry. Did you
just make a pass at me?

16:31.555 --> 16:32.904
Ma'am, forgive me.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.732
Oh, no, no, no,
it's not that I'm not flattered,

16:34.819 --> 16:36.517
but I'm the mother
of, like, five children.

16:36.604 --> 16:37.822
I've been married for 100 years.

16:37.909 --> 16:39.346
Why would you think...?

16:39.433 --> 16:41.087
I was wrong, ma'am.
I was way out of line.

16:41.174 --> 16:43.045
Do I give off that kind of vibe?

16:43.132 --> 16:44.133
Because I would hate to think

16:44.220 --> 16:45.265
people are walking around

16:45.352 --> 16:46.744
with me giving them false hopes.

16:46.831 --> 16:48.790
Would it help
if I changed my hair?

16:48.877 --> 16:50.487
-Ma'am, I really have to go.
-Sure.

16:50.574 --> 16:52.707
Don't beat yourself up.

16:52.794 --> 16:55.884
I'm sure there are many women
who find you very attractive.

17:02.934 --> 17:04.588
Don't forget the cherry.

17:05.675 --> 17:07.983
There. Happy?

17:09.157 --> 17:11.595
In truth,
it was better conceptually.

17:11.682 --> 17:13.075
Just give me my money
and leave me alone.

17:13.162 --> 17:15.077
Tough words
for a human sundae.

17:15.946 --> 17:18.037
Oops. What do you know?

17:18.124 --> 17:19.951
That's the last of it.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.648
Really? That's the last of it?

17:21.736 --> 17:22.911
So it appears.

17:22.998 --> 17:25.348
Aha! Who looks
like the idiot now, huh?

17:25.435 --> 17:26.784
I've got all the money--

17:26.871 --> 17:29.961
all $148 of it, and what
do you have, little man?

17:30.049 --> 17:32.007
-Nothing!
-Except my self-respect,

17:32.094 --> 17:34.096
but it's hard
to put a price on that.

17:35.141 --> 17:37.882
Wait, maybe I can.

17:50.460 --> 17:51.896
Reese?

17:51.983 --> 17:53.202
You in here?

17:53.289 --> 17:55.335
REESE: I have a present
for you.

17:55.422 --> 17:57.163
What?

17:57.250 --> 18:00.383
Something I've never given
another girl in my entire life.

18:00.470 --> 18:01.950
I hope you
like it.

18:04.648 --> 18:06.085
Reese, what the...?

18:08.261 --> 18:10.524
Oh, my God, you tied a bow.

18:10.611 --> 18:12.221
I'm giving you
my innocence.

18:12.308 --> 18:15.050
I've saved myself
for you, Abby.

18:15.137 --> 18:16.878
-Let's not wait any longer.
-I'm gay.

18:16.965 --> 18:18.140
What?!

18:18.227 --> 18:20.142
-I like women.
-Are you kidding?

18:20.229 --> 18:21.230
No. I thought you knew.

18:23.928 --> 18:25.539
You dropped your bow.

18:25.626 --> 18:27.497
[gasps]

18:30.544 --> 18:33.155
So, you don't think I'm
attractive, not even a little?

18:33.242 --> 18:36.376
Look, uh, maybe if you were
the last person on earth,

18:36.463 --> 18:37.855
or we were trapped

18:37.942 --> 18:40.119
on a desert island,
and you had surgery...

18:41.511 --> 18:44.601
Nope. You're still dog meat.

18:44.688 --> 18:47.300
This is fantastic!
We're buddies again!

18:47.387 --> 18:48.866
We're right back
where we started!

18:48.953 --> 18:49.911
[laughs nervously]

18:49.998 --> 18:51.956
Wait a minute.

18:52.043 --> 18:55.090
But If I'm not the girl you're
hung up on around here...

18:55.177 --> 18:56.613
[sighs]

18:56.700 --> 18:57.701
Oh, my God.

18:57.788 --> 18:59.312
Oh, my God!

18:59.399 --> 19:00.356
Reese, it was just a stupid...

19:00.443 --> 19:02.489
Big Gloria, the meter reader?

19:02.576 --> 19:03.925
Yes.

19:04.012 --> 19:05.970
Yes. There was an awkward scene.

19:06.057 --> 19:08.799
It turns out she's taken,
but that's not why I'm leaving.

19:08.886 --> 19:10.453
May not be seeing you
for a while, Big Dog.

19:10.540 --> 19:12.325
So, this really is it then?

19:12.412 --> 19:14.327
You take care
of yourself, Reese.

19:14.414 --> 19:16.503
You're a great guy,
you know that?

19:16.590 --> 19:18.374
You're more than that.

19:18.461 --> 19:21.421
You're the best friend
I've ever had.

19:24.424 --> 19:25.425
[groans and coughs]

19:27.078 --> 19:28.732
I'll miss you, too, buddy.

19:30.343 --> 19:32.910
A little more, and you'll be

19:32.997 --> 19:35.174
just like new.

19:38.699 --> 19:41.092
All I got to say is
that you better be good to her.

19:42.703 --> 19:44.705
[shrieks]
Oh! Sweet mother of God!

19:44.792 --> 19:45.967
[screams]

19:46.054 --> 19:47.751
-You home wrecker!
-[pounding]

19:47.838 --> 19:49.971
Hal, what are you doing?

19:50.885 --> 19:52.669
Saving our marriage!

19:52.756 --> 19:55.063
-What?!
-[grunts] I-I...

19:55.150 --> 19:57.544
I was trying to put
your orthotics back together

19:57.631 --> 19:59.589
the way they were, but I...

19:59.676 --> 20:01.025
There's only so much
I can take, Lois.

20:01.112 --> 20:03.898
At some point,
a man has to take a stand.

20:03.985 --> 20:05.726
What do you mean, put them
back the way they were?

20:05.813 --> 20:08.119
Did you do something
to my orthotics?

20:08.207 --> 20:10.252
Yes, and I'd do it again.

20:10.339 --> 20:12.602
-Why?!
-Because...

20:14.561 --> 20:17.477
Because I miss the old you.

20:17.564 --> 20:19.479
I missed the Lois
who would come home

20:19.566 --> 20:21.568
racked with pain and tension

20:21.655 --> 20:24.440
and snarling
like a rabid bobcat.

20:24.527 --> 20:27.661
That Lois needed me
to make her feel better.

20:27.748 --> 20:29.793
Oh, Hal.

20:29.880 --> 20:31.621
So, now you know.

20:31.708 --> 20:33.623
Now you can go out
and get new...

20:33.710 --> 20:37.279
orthotics, and I'll just try
to stay out of your way.

20:37.366 --> 20:39.890
Hal, you are
being ridiculous.

20:39.977 --> 20:42.153
These things are not gonna
replace you.

20:42.241 --> 20:45.374
Remember that time I got that
nonstick German waffle iron?

20:45.461 --> 20:48.508
I was walking on air for weeks,
but it didn't last.

20:48.595 --> 20:50.074
True.

20:50.161 --> 20:51.859
[scoffs] Remember when
our kids made us happy?

20:51.946 --> 20:54.078
Oh, well, we were both
just being stupid there.

20:54.165 --> 20:55.863
But the point is,

20:55.950 --> 20:58.300
something's always
gonna come up.

20:58.387 --> 21:00.737
I'll be miserable again.

21:01.869 --> 21:03.523
You promise?

21:03.610 --> 21:06.003
Of course.

21:06.090 --> 21:07.483
[laughs]

21:08.832 --> 21:10.530
Come on.

21:10.617 --> 21:14.011
Now, I am gonna get
another pair, Hal.

21:14.098 --> 21:16.187
Fine, but I don't want
to know about 'em.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.233
And keep them out
of our bedroom.
