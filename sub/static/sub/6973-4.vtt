[Woman]
We're so sorry, Becky.

00:06.806 --> 00:08.740
[Woman #2]
If there's anything we can do for you,

00:08.808 --> 00:10.742
anything at all,
just let us know.

00:10.810 --> 00:14.371
Thank you so much.

00:14.447 --> 00:16.438
That would have meant
a lot to him.

00:17.617 --> 00:20.950
Oh, thank you.

Mrs. Crouch,

00:37.003 --> 00:39.563
I'm sorry for your loss.

00:39.639 --> 00:41.573
Thank you, Mr...

00:41.641 --> 00:43.609
Johnson.

00:43.676 --> 00:45.906
I worked briefly
with your husband.

00:47.847 --> 00:52.147
I was impressed by him...
very much so.

00:52.218 --> 00:54.846
Thank you.

00:54.921 --> 00:56.855
Sorry.

01:16.576 --> 01:19.044
Hell of a Christmas,
Raymond.

01:25.251 --> 01:28.277
He's at peace now.

01:28.354 --> 01:30.845
That's one small comfort
to be drawn.

01:38.531 --> 01:41.295
He didn't even leave
a note.

02:22.842 --> 02:24.901
"I am the resurrection
and the life.

02:24.978 --> 02:29.074
"He that believeth in Me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live.

02:29.149 --> 02:32.414
And whosoever liveth and believeth
in Me shall never die."

02:32.485 --> 02:34.783
"I am the resurrection
and the life.

02:34.854 --> 02:37.414
"He that believeth in Me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live.

02:37.490 --> 02:41.551

02:41.628 --> 02:43.562
"I am the resurrection

"He that believeth in Me...

[Continues, Indistinct]

05:37.502 --> 05:39.436
Thank you, ma'am.

05:45.777 --> 05:49.713
- Are you with the F.B.I. Too?
- Yes, sir.

05:49.781 --> 05:52.272
Look, I know my job.
The man was deceased.

05:52.350 --> 05:55.251
- I'm sorry?
- I understand...

05:55.320 --> 05:57.413
that he was
one of your own.

05:57.489 --> 06:02.017
But these rumors I'm hearing that I put
a living human being into the ground?

06:02.094 --> 06:05.552
You people better get
your facts straight real fast.

06:12.137 --> 06:15.595
Mulder? You been
spreading rumors?

06:15.674 --> 06:17.938
Why? You hear any
good ones lately?

06:18.009 --> 06:20.739
- Not particularly.
- [Flies Buzzing]

06:20.812 --> 06:23.007
So what do you
have here?

06:23.081 --> 06:25.015
Merry Christmas,
by the way, Scully.

06:25.083 --> 06:28.211
Thank you.
Merry Christmas to you too.

06:28.286 --> 06:30.311
Grave robbery
with a twist.

06:31.523 --> 06:33.650
Check out the headliner,
Scully.

06:35.227 --> 06:39.163
Well, it looks like someone
on the inside was trying to get out.

06:39.231 --> 06:41.199
Indeed it does.
And to answer your question,

06:41.266 --> 06:43.200
no, I haven't been spreading
any rumors.

06:43.268 --> 06:45.828
The local P.D.'s been doing
a pretty good job of that,

06:45.904 --> 06:49.601
ever since they matched the fingerprints
on the dead man to these.

06:49.674 --> 06:53.166
And to those up there
on that headstone.

06:53.245 --> 06:55.839
There's a big juicy handprint
on the back.

06:58.617 --> 07:03.179
What about the person, or persons,
who did the digging?

07:03.255 --> 07:06.713
Well, we've got
one pile of dirt.

07:08.193 --> 07:10.559
I'm guessing one man
with a shovel.

07:12.931 --> 07:16.697
Other than that, last night's rain
hasn't left us much to go on.

07:16.768 --> 07:18.895
Well, go ahead, Scully.
Nay say me.

07:18.970 --> 07:21.404
The body of an F.B.I. Agent
gets disinterred,

07:21.473 --> 07:24.806
only to climb out on its own
and disappear into the Yuletide night.

07:24.876 --> 07:28.573
- See, you had me up until there.
- Did I?

07:28.647 --> 07:31.673
I think it's what you said before. I
think it's a grave robbery with a twist.

07:31.750 --> 07:35.413
You've got the fingerprints
and the torn casket liner.

07:35.487 --> 07:39.856
Most likely, it's rigged evidence that's
been faked by whoever exhumed the body.

07:39.925 --> 07:43.019
- Faked for what effect?
- Publicity.

07:43.094 --> 07:46.996
Fear. Rumors. I mean,
I don't know what specific effect,

07:47.065 --> 07:49.727
but nonetheless, it's...

07:49.801 --> 07:53.862
- What?
- Looks like blood.

07:56.508 --> 07:59.773
"And whosoever liveth and believeth
in Me shall never die."

07:59.844 --> 08:01.778
"I am the resurrection
and the life.

08:01.846 --> 08:03.814
"He that believeth in Me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live.

08:03.882 --> 08:06.407
And whosoever liveth and believeth
in Me shall never die."

08:06.484 --> 08:08.418
[Pounding]

08:16.161 --> 08:18.652
"I am the resurrection
and the life.

08:18.730 --> 08:20.755
"He that believeth in Me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live.

08:20.832 --> 08:22.891
And whosoever liveth and believeth

08:22.968 --> 08:24.902
"I am the resurrection
and the life."

08:36.481 --> 08:38.414
[Scully]
Special Agent Raymond Crouch.

08:38.482 --> 08:41.611
Age 56.
Married, no children.

08:41.686 --> 08:44.553
After a sterling
21 -year career with the Bureau,

08:44.623 --> 08:47.217
he retired in 1993.

08:47.292 --> 08:49.556
And then earlier this month,

08:49.628 --> 08:51.994
he was found in the garage
of his Tallahassee home,

08:52.063 --> 08:54.896
service weapon in hand.

08:54.966 --> 08:57.264
Definitely
self-inflicted?

08:57.335 --> 09:01.465
I read over the report,
and there's no indication otherwise.

09:01.539 --> 09:03.404
How about a motive
for the grave robberies?

09:03.475 --> 09:05.875
Well, we've gone through all the cases
Crouch had a hand in,

09:05.944 --> 09:08.344
and he doesn't seem
to have made any enemies.

09:08.413 --> 09:10.347
Same thing
with his personal life.

09:10.415 --> 09:13.578
No large debts,
no feuds with neighbors,

09:13.652 --> 09:15.586
never a bad word
against him.

09:15.654 --> 09:19.317
- Nothing stands out?
- Should something stand out?

09:20.659 --> 09:22.593
Agent Mulder,
what's your take on this?

09:22.661 --> 09:25.789
Well, only that I don't think
it was grave robbery per se.

09:27.565 --> 09:31.296
It was necromancy...
the summoning of the dead.

09:32.871 --> 09:36.204
It's a form of magic dating back
to primitive shamanism...

09:36.274 --> 09:38.674
with a long tradition
in the Christian Church.

09:38.743 --> 09:41.211
Through it, the dead are brought
back to life for the purposes...

09:41.279 --> 09:43.645
of divulging arcane knowledge
or performing ritual tasks.

09:43.715 --> 09:46.548
So that's what this wacko thought
he was doing... raising the dead?

09:46.618 --> 09:50.611
That's what he was doing.
This is a, uh...

09:50.689 --> 09:52.714
That's a magic circle drawn
in goats'blood.

09:52.791 --> 09:55.783
The rain washed
most of it away.

09:55.860 --> 09:58.385
The blood attracts
the spirits of the undead,

09:58.463 --> 10:00.454
while the circle focuses
the necromancer's power...

10:00.532 --> 10:02.796
while protecting him from
the spirits that he's conjuring.

10:02.867 --> 10:04.994
Okay.

10:05.070 --> 10:08.699
He may also desire to wear
the clothes of the dead man
to create a bond between them.

10:10.041 --> 10:12.009
You would not want to be
this man's dry cleaner.

10:12.077 --> 10:17.140
Obviously, there are clear
ritualistic elements to this crime.

10:17.215 --> 10:20.150
But the question is, why were
they directed at Raymond Crouch?

10:20.218 --> 10:22.152
That is the question.

10:22.220 --> 10:24.154
[Knocking]

10:24.222 --> 10:26.213
Well, let's come up
with an answer.

10:28.760 --> 10:32.753
Mulder, Scully,
a word, please?

10:40.271 --> 10:42.899
Necromancy aside,
this magic circle you mentioned,

10:42.974 --> 10:44.908
what if it looks
something like this?

10:47.145 --> 10:50.444
It's an oroboros.
Possibly.

10:50.515 --> 10:54.212
Defnitely a mystical symbol.
The alchemists favored it.

10:54.285 --> 10:56.515
They believe that it represented
all of existence.

10:56.588 --> 10:58.556
I'm thinking more of
the Millennium Group.

10:58.623 --> 11:02.024
It was their symbol as well.
Are you familiar with them?

11:02.093 --> 11:04.027
Yeah, somewhat.
They were, uh,

11:04.095 --> 11:08.429
former F.B.I. Agents who offered
consulting services to law enforcement.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.593
Somehow,
they fell into disrepute.

11:10.668 --> 11:12.602
[Skinner]
They operated in extreme secrecy.

11:12.670 --> 11:14.604
Rumors abounded that they had
their own agenda,

11:14.672 --> 11:18.342
which was less than altruistic,
if not improper or illegal.

11:18.475 --> 11:20.943
That it was, in fact,
a cult based upon...

11:21.011 --> 11:23.036
Judeo-Christian End Time
prophecies...

11:23.113 --> 11:25.513
concerning
the coming millennium.

11:25.582 --> 11:28.608
- Was Raymond Crouch a member?
- I can't seem to fnd out.

11:28.685 --> 11:30.744
Apparently, the group dissolved
several months ago.

11:30.821 --> 11:32.948
They left no paper trail,
nothing.

11:33.023 --> 11:36.481
However,

11:36.560 --> 11:39.927
I do have three other
grave desecrations,
all within the last six months.

11:44.501 --> 11:47.800
Long Island,
Northern California, Arizona.

11:47.871 --> 11:51.739
All three graves contained the bodies
of former F.B.I. Agents.

11:51.808 --> 11:54.800
All three
were recent suicides.

11:54.878 --> 11:57.779
How long were you gonna
sit on this?

11:57.848 --> 12:00.646
Owing to the Millennium Group's
former ties with the Bureau,

12:00.717 --> 12:03.447
this matter is sensitive,
to say the least.

12:05.856 --> 12:08.848
Investigate them.
Keep a low profile.

12:11.161 --> 12:13.095
I think I know
where to start.

12:16.166 --> 12:19.101
- How well do you know this man?
- Only by reputation.

12:19.169 --> 12:22.070
- [Door Buzzes]
- He left VICAP before I got there.

12:22.139 --> 12:26.337
But he's been called
the greatest criminal profiler
that Quantico ever produced.

12:26.410 --> 12:29.072
- What's he doing here?
- Good morning.

12:29.146 --> 12:33.480
Apparently, he, uh, checked
himself in for a 30-day observation.

12:33.550 --> 12:36.451
I gather the last few years
haven't been very kind to him.

12:36.520 --> 12:39.080
But if there's anybody that can tell us
about the Millennium Group, it's him.

12:39.156 --> 12:41.386
He used to consult for 'em.
Later, he fought to bring 'em down...

12:41.458 --> 12:43.824
at the expense of his own career
and reputation.

12:43.894 --> 12:47.295
- Single-minded.
Sounds like someone I know.
- Yeah.

12:47.364 --> 12:50.390
[Announcer] Twelve yard line.
They are threatening.

Frank Black?

12:54.538 --> 12:57.974
Hi, my name is Fox Mulder.
This is my partner, Dana Scully.

12:58.041 --> 13:01.977
It's a pleasure to meet you.
You mind if we sit down?

13:02.045 --> 13:04.206
Higgins tries the middle,
and he gets...

13:04.281 --> 13:07.011
- [Groans]
- Nowhere!

13:07.083 --> 13:10.917
- Who's playing?
- Uh, it's Notre Dame
and Boston College.

13:10.987 --> 13:13.820
Ah, the Fighting Irish
and the Golden Eagles, huh?

13:15.392 --> 13:17.326
What can I do for you,
agents?

13:18.795 --> 13:21.764
Well, we're working
on a case that, uh,

13:21.832 --> 13:23.993
we feel that you might have
some particular insight to.

13:24.067 --> 13:26.535
The deaths of
four F.B.I. Agents.

13:26.603 --> 13:29.094
- Do you recognize these men?
- I do.

13:33.143 --> 13:36.510
All four committed suicide
in the last six months.

13:38.348 --> 13:42.717
All were exhumed from their graves
in a ritual desecration.

13:42.786 --> 13:46.745
They were members of the Millennium
Group. Is that correct?

13:50.927 --> 13:53.157
Sir, we've been having
a really difficult time...

13:53.230 --> 13:56.222
gleaning any information
whatsoever about the group.

13:57.501 --> 14:00.095
About its membership,
its practices.

14:00.170 --> 14:02.866
I believe you can help us.

14:02.939 --> 14:05.430
No, thank you.
I'm retired.

14:07.878 --> 14:09.937
I think you can tell
by the circumstances...

14:10.013 --> 14:11.947
that I'm trying to put
my life back together.

14:12.015 --> 14:13.949
I can't get involved
in this.

14:14.017 --> 14:15.951
We're not asking you
to get involved.

14:16.019 --> 14:18.112
I'm just asking you to take a look
at the case file.

14:18.188 --> 14:20.122
No, thank you.

14:23.159 --> 14:26.822
Mr. Black, the day after tomorrow
is January 1, 2000.

14:26.897 --> 14:29.889
That's the signifcant date
for these people.

14:29.966 --> 14:32.264
That doesn't leave us
much time.

14:34.571 --> 14:37.233
Don't you wanna
see them stopped?

14:43.847 --> 14:45.781
[Announcer On TVContinues,
Indistinct]

14:47.083 --> 14:49.017
Well, Mr. Black,

14:49.085 --> 14:51.019
you are not
what I was expecting.

14:51.087 --> 14:54.318
- Agent Mulder?
- Yes?

14:54.391 --> 14:57.588
It's first and eighteen.

14:57.661 --> 15:00.095
Just let me
watch this game in peace.

15:01.398 --> 15:04.265
It's third and ten.
Notre Dame.

15:04.334 --> 15:06.564
- Happy New Year.
- Same to you.

15:15.178 --> 15:18.170
[Police Radio Chattering]

15:25.455 --> 15:27.423
- Evening.
- Hi.

15:27.490 --> 15:29.651
Could I, uh,
give you a hand?

15:29.726 --> 15:31.660
Oh, no, I'm about done.

15:31.728 --> 15:34.663
But thanks. Guess I ran over
a nail or something.

15:34.731 --> 15:37.632
- Well, I can help you see, at least.
- Yeah.

15:37.701 --> 15:40.363
I've been driving all night.
It'll be good to get home.

15:40.437 --> 15:42.928
I hear ya.

15:43.006 --> 15:45.907
[Sniffing]
Man! Whew!

15:47.811 --> 15:51.440
- What is that?
- Uh...

15:51.514 --> 15:54.972
I think a deer maybe
must've died out there in the woods.

15:55.051 --> 15:57.485
[Flies Buzzing]

15:59.155 --> 16:01.419
Sir?

16:01.491 --> 16:03.186
What's in the truck?

16:05.228 --> 16:07.355
- Nothing.
- Mind if I take a look?

16:07.430 --> 16:09.364
There's nothing in there,
so...

16:09.432 --> 16:11.992
Drop that,
take two steps back.

16:12.969 --> 16:14.903
Drop it.

16:16.873 --> 16:18.864
[Crowbar Hits Ground]

16:20.577 --> 16:22.511
[Flies Buzzing]

16:25.582 --> 16:29.780
"And whosoever liveth and believeth
in Me shall never die."

16:29.853 --> 16:31.980
"I am the resurrection
and the life.

16:32.055 --> 16:34.819
"He that believeth in Me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live.

16:34.891 --> 16:36.882
And whosoever liveth and believeth
in Me shall never die."

16:38.261 --> 16:41.958
Oh, Lord.
Stand up there!

16:42.032 --> 16:44.592
Stand up!
Let me see your hands!

16:45.702 --> 16:49.297
- [Continues Reciting Prayer]
- What?

16:49.372 --> 16:51.465
Speak up!

16:51.541 --> 16:53.736
[Growling]

16:53.810 --> 16:56.244
[Deputy Screaming]

17:23.036 --> 17:25.630
Hey.

17:25.704 --> 17:27.763
I've got the men
concentrating on the woods.

17:27.840 --> 17:29.775
Our necromancer
was definitely here.

17:34.815 --> 17:36.783
It's salt.
Heavy magic.

17:38.518 --> 17:40.452
Well, if you're gonna tell me
that he, uh,

17:40.520 --> 17:42.886
stopped by the side of the road
to raise the dead,

17:42.956 --> 17:46.255
which I hope you're not,
I've got two things to say to you.

17:46.326 --> 17:51.263
One is that his previous circles
were made of blood, not salt. And two...

17:51.331 --> 17:53.265
And they were large enough
to contain a body.

17:53.333 --> 17:56.598
This is just a protective circle.
It's just big enough
for one man to stand inside.

17:56.670 --> 17:58.604
Protecting himself
against what?

17:58.672 --> 18:00.765
[Mulder]
Whatever it was that did that.

18:00.841 --> 18:03.503
[Man]
Agents!

18:03.577 --> 18:06.137
Over here!

18:11.418 --> 18:14.046
I saw a lump in the ground.

18:18.258 --> 18:19.691
My God.

18:24.097 --> 18:27.191
Bite marks.
They look human.

18:27.267 --> 18:28.700
More salt.

18:41.715 --> 18:43.740
"I am he that liveth
and was dead.

18:43.817 --> 18:47.082
"And behold, I am alive
for evermore, Amen,

18:47.153 --> 18:49.087
and have the keys
of hell and of death."

18:51.925 --> 18:55.224
Book of Revelations,
chapter 1, verse 18.

18:56.963 --> 18:58.897
Go Fighting Irish.

19:02.135 --> 19:05.036
[Mulder]
"First and eighteen."

19:05.105 --> 19:07.573
It's not football.
It's Revelations.

19:09.676 --> 19:11.610
You wanted to
tell us something, Frank.

19:11.678 --> 19:13.612
Why don't you just
come out and say it.

19:13.680 --> 19:15.875
I don't know what you're talking about.
I told you.

19:15.949 --> 19:18.042
- I cannot get involved in this.
- Right.

19:18.118 --> 19:21.713
So you'll occasionally drop
the little arcane hint?

19:23.490 --> 19:25.583
A police officer
was murdered, Frank.

19:25.659 --> 19:28.127
Why do you want
to play around?

19:28.194 --> 19:30.594
Your denials aside, you obviously
know something about that.

19:30.664 --> 19:34.031
You knew
that we'd find this.

19:34.100 --> 19:35.965
What are you afraid of?

19:37.671 --> 19:41.573
Losing your daughter.

19:41.641 --> 19:44.735
You're in a custody battle
with the parents of your late wife.

19:47.013 --> 19:50.471
I just spoke with your doctor.
That's why you're here.

19:50.550 --> 19:53.348
They claimed I was an unfit father...
that I was obsessed with conspiracy,

19:53.420 --> 19:55.581
the end of the world.

19:55.655 --> 19:58.749
That my work meant more to me
than my daughter, Jordan.

19:59.893 --> 20:03.329
The thing is,
they were right.

20:05.298 --> 20:08.495
- And so you retired.
- I will sell insurance.

20:08.568 --> 20:11.731
I'll do whatever it takes.
I'll get well and jump through
whatever hoops they want,

20:11.805 --> 20:15.639
but I will not mention
the Millennium Group again.

20:15.709 --> 20:18.177
But you obviously
want to help.

20:18.244 --> 20:21.111
You... dropped
that clue on us.

20:23.316 --> 20:26.752
Look, Frank, nobody
needs to know about this.

20:28.388 --> 20:30.856
We're just three people
sitting around talking.

20:43.003 --> 20:47.440
The Book of Revelations describes
the end of the physical world...

20:47.507 --> 20:50.965
in a battle between heaven and hell...
good against evil.

20:51.044 --> 20:55.003
The Millennium Group believed
that that time was upon us.

20:55.081 --> 20:57.379
These four represent
a schism in the group.

20:59.452 --> 21:01.579
They believe that for the End Time
to come as it must,

21:01.655 --> 21:04.954
man must take an active hand
in bringing that about.

21:05.025 --> 21:08.153
- And to that end,
they committed suicide?
- Yeah.

21:08.228 --> 21:10.856
With the express purpose
of being brought back to life.

21:10.930 --> 21:13.797
The four horsemen
of the apocalypse.

21:13.867 --> 21:15.835
These four men
bring with them...

21:15.902 --> 21:17.961
war, pestilence,
famine and death.

21:18.038 --> 21:20.370
So that all the dead of the earth
will rise.

21:20.440 --> 21:22.670
Armageddon.

21:22.742 --> 21:27.008
It must begin with the dawn
of the millennium, or not at all.

21:27.080 --> 21:29.014
That's what they believe.

21:31.217 --> 21:33.344
The man you're looking for,
your necromancer,

21:33.420 --> 21:36.912
he exhumed these men
in accordance with their wishes.

21:36.990 --> 21:40.016
- So is he a member of
the Millennium Group as well?
- No.

21:40.093 --> 21:41.924
They sought him out.

21:41.995 --> 21:44.361
He believes he's doing
God's work.

21:44.431 --> 21:46.399
But he's mistaken.

21:46.466 --> 21:48.525
Could you tell us
a little bit more about this man?

21:48.601 --> 21:51.661
Well, he's a white male,
45 to 50.

21:51.738 --> 21:54.229
He's a religious man.
No police record.

21:54.307 --> 21:56.537
No fulfilling relationship.

21:56.609 --> 21:59.407
You would pass him
without giving him a glance.

21:59.479 --> 22:02.414
So this is the one event
that will give his life meaning?

22:02.482 --> 22:04.416
Yeah.

22:04.484 --> 22:08.545
He needs privacy for this.
He'll live alone.

22:08.621 --> 22:10.555
Possibly in the house
he grew up in.

22:10.623 --> 22:15.617
Most likely it's a large,
rural property away from prying eyes.

22:15.695 --> 22:18.926
He'll own a truck or a van.
He needs it to transport the bodies.

22:18.998 --> 22:22.900
There'll be high fences,
"No Trespassing"signs.

22:22.969 --> 22:25.403
It's a solitary existence.

22:25.472 --> 22:28.006
He's worked around death
all his life in some capacity.

22:28.139 --> 22:31.199
A funeral parlor
or a cemetery.

22:31.275 --> 22:34.642
- Death comforts him.
- [Man On TV]
A Rice County deputy missing...

22:34.712 --> 22:38.614
He took great care in burying
the deputy, in preparing the body,

22:38.683 --> 22:41.345
despite the fact that
he feared being caught.

22:41.419 --> 22:44.183
He stapled the lips,
sealed the mouth shut.

22:44.255 --> 22:46.553
It was to prevent the man
from coming back to life.

22:46.624 --> 22:51.527
He believes that if disturbed,
the deputy will rise from the dead.

22:51.596 --> 22:53.928
It's too soon for that,
which is why...

22:53.998 --> 22:56.296
when he realizes the deputy
has been discovered,

22:56.367 --> 22:58.733
he'll feel a need
to take action.

22:58.803 --> 23:01.067
He'll return to the body
the first chance he gets.

23:01.139 --> 23:03.300
Rice County Morgue.

23:03.374 --> 23:05.308
I think
you'll catch him there.

23:05.376 --> 23:08.470
These four members of
the Millennium Group,

23:08.546 --> 23:10.605
the ones that
"truly liveth who are dead,"

23:10.681 --> 23:14.139
there are the ones
we have to catch.

23:14.218 --> 23:16.482
- Mr. Black?
- Yeah?

23:16.554 --> 23:18.647
You've got a phone call.
I think it might be your daughter.

23:18.723 --> 23:21.920
Thank you.
My daughter. Excuse me.

23:27.498 --> 23:29.432
Mulder, you're telling me
it's more important...

23:29.500 --> 23:31.434
to track down four dead bodies
than one live murderer?

23:31.502 --> 23:34.403
He's not our murderer,
and those four dead bodies aren't dead.

23:34.472 --> 23:36.667
- And the millennium is 14 hours away.
- [Door Buzzing]

23:36.741 --> 23:38.675
Mulder, these people,
even when they were alive,

23:38.743 --> 23:42.770
mangled Biblical prophecy
to the extent that it's unrecognizable.

23:42.847 --> 23:45.407
And the year 2000 is just
their artificial deadline.

23:45.483 --> 23:49.613
And besides, 2001 is actually
the start of the new millennium.

23:49.687 --> 23:51.882
Nobody likes
a math geek, Scully.

23:51.956 --> 23:54.550
Anyway, I think that
Frank's profile is sound.

23:54.625 --> 23:56.616
- I do too.
- And I think with it,

23:56.694 --> 23:59.390
we have the best chance of finding
this necromancer, as you call him.

24:00.765 --> 24:03.233
So I'm going down
to the county morgue.

24:03.301 --> 24:06.702
- I absolutely think you should.
- And what are you gonna do?

24:06.771 --> 24:09.239
Follow the profile.
The deputy was killed...

24:09.307 --> 24:11.832
on a road that connects
from the north with no major highway.

24:11.909 --> 24:14.309
I'm thinking our necromancer
lives nearby.

24:14.378 --> 24:18.508
I'm gonna do a rundown on all
single landowners in the area,
see where the bodies are buried.

24:18.583 --> 24:21.984
Oh, Scully,
will you do me a favor?

24:22.053 --> 24:25.716
Don't let anybody remove the staples
from the deputy's mouth, okay?

24:25.790 --> 24:27.724
Please? Just humor me?
Thanks.

24:47.345 --> 24:49.677
Proceeding with the visual
examination of the mouth.

- What appears to be salt...

25:06.931 --> 25:09.923

- [Sully Leaving Message, Indistinctly]

You've reached Rice County Morgue.

25:39.597 --> 25:41.531
No one can come to the phone.

[Scully On Machine] This is
Agent Dana Scully with the F.B.I.

25:49.373 --> 25:53.901
Please do not autopsy the murder
victim that was brought in
earlier... the sheriff's deputy.

25:53.978 --> 25:56.776
If you've already started,
stop now.

25:56.847 --> 25:59.782
I'll be there shortly,
and I'll explain when I arrive.

28:13.316 --> 28:15.477
[Scully]
Sir?

28:23.959 --> 28:25.893
How you feeling?

28:27.129 --> 28:29.063
All things considered?

28:29.131 --> 28:32.498
What the hell happened here?
Who is that man?

28:32.568 --> 28:35.401
The sheriff's deputy.

28:35.471 --> 28:37.803
The man we found
this morning.

28:37.873 --> 28:39.807
He was dead.

28:39.875 --> 28:41.809
And then somehow,
he wasn't.

28:41.877 --> 28:43.811
He attacked me.

28:43.879 --> 28:46.643
You shot him?

28:46.716 --> 28:49.810
Three rounds, center of mass
into his chest.

28:49.885 --> 28:51.819
No effect.

28:55.124 --> 28:57.319
There's a gunshot wound
to his head as well.

28:57.393 --> 28:59.327
Yeah, this man, uh,

28:59.395 --> 29:03.957
Mulder calls the necromancer,
our suspect, he was here too.

29:04.033 --> 29:06.228
He fired that shot
with my gun.

29:07.503 --> 29:09.664
He saved me.
I have no idea why.

29:09.739 --> 29:13.470
He got away,
but I was in no shape to follow.

29:13.542 --> 29:15.703
Look, sir,

29:15.778 --> 29:19.407
I can't even begin to offer
an explanation for what happened.

29:20.983 --> 29:24.009
But I have to say
it is exactly what Mulder feared.

29:24.086 --> 29:28.216
Yeah, which is why
I would like to talk to him.
Why isn't he answering his phone?

29:59.555 --> 30:02.149

Open the door!

32:58.532 --> 33:00.500

Hey!

33:02.836 --> 33:06.328
[Gunfre]

33:06.640 --> 33:10.201
I haven't heard from him.
He didn't go to the morgue with you?

33:10.277 --> 33:12.745
No, he went looking
for our suspect's home.

33:12.813 --> 33:15.213
No one's been able
to contact him since.

33:15.282 --> 33:19.412
I've got task force agents canvassing
the northwestern Maryland area,

33:19.486 --> 33:23.582
but it's a large territory to cover,
and we're running out of time.

33:25.626 --> 33:30.222
Sir, I'm just afraid that Mulder
may have found what he's looking for.

33:31.465 --> 33:33.399
I need your help
in finding him.

33:33.467 --> 33:38.097
Now, you respected my reasons
in the past, Agent Scully.
Please respect them now.

33:38.172 --> 33:41.573
I'm not sure that
I really understand your reasons, sir.

33:41.642 --> 33:45.237
And I'm starting to wonder
what this is all about,
and how much you know about it.

33:47.448 --> 33:50.508
Mulder mentioned the four
Millennium members...
