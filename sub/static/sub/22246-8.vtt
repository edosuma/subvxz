00:22.981 --> 00:25.692
[theme music playing]

02:00.411 --> 02:01.663
[Holden]  "Deviant.

02:02.372 --> 02:03.665
Pyromania.

02:04.374 --> 02:05.375
Torture.

02:06.251 --> 02:07.127
Mutilation."

02:07.210 --> 02:10.004
[man] I understand what you're
trying to do, and I appreciate it.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.549
Using Career Week to discuss
early intervention, it's a great idea.

02:12.632 --> 02:15.260
I had been thinking about
how we educate kids when you called.

02:15.343 --> 02:18.847
And coming from the FBI,
it is a powerful statement.

02:19.556 --> 02:22.851
But how do I get it across
if I can't use these words?

02:28.398 --> 02:29.482
"Mutilation."

02:30.108 --> 02:33.278
If you use that, I guarantee you
that at least one of them,

02:33.361 --> 02:37.031
Jenny Cromer, Michael Stahl,
these are confident, curious children.

02:37.115 --> 02:39.576
They will ask you what "mutilation" means.

02:39.659 --> 02:42.412
-And I can describe it, and specifically--
-And then...

02:43.121 --> 02:44.581
a few of them will go home,

02:45.081 --> 02:46.499
they'll have nightmares,

02:46.583 --> 02:48.585
and tomorrow I'll be fielding calls
from parents

02:48.668 --> 02:49.836
who will be concerned--

02:49.919 --> 02:52.714
-Parents should be discussing this, too.
-Absolutely.

02:52.797 --> 02:55.967
And if I had the time to build
a foundation for their understanding,

02:56.050 --> 02:59.345
-I'd be on board.
-[sighs]

03:00.013 --> 03:01.264
So no "torture."

03:02.265 --> 03:03.558
Could I say "hurting"?

03:04.434 --> 03:05.393
"Hurting" animals?

03:05.476 --> 03:07.854
What about "being mean" to animals?

03:10.982 --> 03:12.817
You really think that "pyromania"
is too much?

03:12.901 --> 03:15.445
-My students will not know what that is.
-"Arson"?

03:15.528 --> 03:16.821
Mm-mm.

03:16.905 --> 03:20.241
-"Deviant"?
-They will not know what that is.

03:20.325 --> 03:22.493
Even if I used it in context?

03:22.577 --> 03:23.620
It's harsh.

03:23.703 --> 03:25.872
We need to prepare them
for the world, yes.

03:26.414 --> 03:29.334
But we also need to protect them from it.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.377
Guess I could say...

03:33.087 --> 03:34.213
"disturbing."

03:36.424 --> 03:37.800
Listen, Agent Ford.

03:38.801 --> 03:40.220
Show them your badge.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.972
-They'll be thrilled.
-[bell rings]

03:43.056 --> 03:46.059
[light applause]

03:46.142 --> 03:50.480
My job at the FBI is to study people
who exhibit disturbing behavior.

03:51.022 --> 03:53.066
If I can classify this behavior,

03:53.149 --> 03:56.569
I can help the police catch these people
when they commit a crime.

03:57.528 --> 03:59.364
But lately I've been asking myself:

04:00.073 --> 04:04.244
can we stop these people from becoming
disturbing in the first place?

04:05.828 --> 04:07.372
That's where you come in.

04:07.997 --> 04:10.333
By your age,
we can start seeing the signs.

04:10.416 --> 04:13.002
In this whole classroom,
statistically speaking,

04:13.086 --> 04:16.422
disturbing behavior would show up
in about one of you.

04:16.923 --> 04:20.260
Say you have a friend
who likes lighting fires.

04:20.343 --> 04:24.597
I mean, deliberately setting things
on fire, like toys or trash.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.934
Another sign that your friend
is disturbed,

04:28.017 --> 04:29.727
is if he shows a lack of remorse.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.312
[man clears throat]

04:31.938 --> 04:36.025
That is, if he's done something wrong,
he doesn't feel bad about it.

04:37.318 --> 04:40.196
-Yes.
-Are only boys disturbed?

04:40.280 --> 04:42.532
Perhaps I should be saying he or she,

04:42.615 --> 04:46.119
but yes, actually, it is mostly males
who are disturbed.

04:46.619 --> 04:49.330
-Sorry, guys.
-[laughing]

04:49.414 --> 04:51.916
Another thing you should be aware of
at your age

04:52.500 --> 04:53.668
is the way we treat animals.

04:53.751 --> 04:56.087
Now animals are nice to us,
so we should be nice back.

04:56.170 --> 05:01.551
But say you have a friend
who is being mean to an animal.

05:01.634 --> 05:04.220
Very mean. You should take note of that.

05:04.971 --> 05:05.805
Yes.

05:05.888 --> 05:07.932
My brother throws rocks at our dog.

05:08.016 --> 05:11.686
Well, that doesn't sound very nice,
but let me ask you:

05:11.769 --> 05:14.355
are they big rocks or little rocks?

05:14.439 --> 05:18.151
-Mm... medium rocks.
-Okay.

05:18.234 --> 05:21.738
The kind of behavior towards animals
that I'm talking about is, um...

05:22.780 --> 05:24.157
forcible...

05:24.699 --> 05:27.910
[stammers] It's not just about
being mean to animals, it's...

05:28.786 --> 05:31.831
It's about hurting the animal,
and you'll know when that's happening

05:31.914 --> 05:35.543
because an animal will let you know
when it is being hurt.

05:38.713 --> 05:43.092
In any case, if you see this, you should
tell a teacher, or your mom, or your dad.

05:43.176 --> 05:48.431
The idea is that you stop your friend,
who is a disturbing kid,

05:48.514 --> 05:51.059
from becoming a disturbing adult,

05:51.142 --> 05:55.063
because one day he may start
being mean to people.

05:56.856 --> 05:57.774
So...

06:02.070 --> 06:03.654
Who wants to see my badge?

06:03.738 --> 06:04.906
[all gasp]

06:04.989 --> 06:07.241
[indistinct chatter]

06:07.742 --> 06:09.827
It means so much to these students

06:09.911 --> 06:11.996
that someone like yourself
would take an interest.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.832
Sure, that was great. They're very smart.

06:15.374 --> 06:17.794
Top standardized test scores
in the district.

06:18.503 --> 06:20.922
Well, if you want to do any more outreach,
just let me know.

06:21.005 --> 06:23.883
Don't say that, I'll hold you to it.
Thanks again.

06:23.966 --> 06:24.884
Thank you.

06:25.718 --> 06:27.887
Sorry. Bye.

06:27.970 --> 06:29.055

06:29.555 --> 06:30.431
Holden.

06:30.515 --> 06:32.600
I'm Janet Ebner.
I teach fourth grade here.

06:32.683 --> 06:35.019
-May I have a moment?
-Sure.

06:35.103 --> 06:37.480
I know you weren't here today
to talk to us,

06:37.563 --> 06:41.109
but I've heard about some behavior
that I'd classify as disturbing.

06:41.692 --> 06:42.610
Okay.

06:42.693 --> 06:46.489
Well, odd at the very least,
but I believe my instincts are good.

06:46.989 --> 06:48.699
It all starts with instinct.

06:48.783 --> 06:50.284
And I'm not the only one.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.245
Some of the other teachers are concerned,

06:52.328 --> 06:54.747
several parents,
certain members of the school board.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.415
We even took it to the local police.

06:57.291 --> 06:58.209
What is it?

06:59.919 --> 07:02.130
Let's go to the staff room. This way.

07:05.925 --> 07:06.926
[Holden] Thank you.

07:09.846 --> 07:12.723
-He has a thing for tickling.
-Who does?

07:12.807 --> 07:15.685
Principal Wade, Roger,
tickles the children.

07:16.727 --> 07:18.438
-Where?
-In his office.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.773
I mean, where on the body?

07:20.857 --> 07:22.024
Their feet.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.944
Sometimes a child will go to his office
for disciplinary reasons,

07:25.027 --> 07:26.154
that's when it happens.

07:26.237 --> 07:27.572
Is it punishment?

07:27.655 --> 07:29.740
I think it's supposed to mitigate
the punishment,

07:29.824 --> 07:31.284
but then he gives them money.

07:31.909 --> 07:33.369
-For what?
-Nickels.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.372
He gives them nickels
if they can withstand the tickling.

07:36.914 --> 07:38.291
Okay, well...

07:39.083 --> 07:40.334
that is odd.

07:40.960 --> 07:44.297
-It's completely inappropriate.
-Has anybody talked with him?

07:44.630 --> 07:47.341
The board questioned him,
nothing happened.

07:47.425 --> 07:49.177
But somebody took it to the police?

07:49.260 --> 07:51.721
I did, at the urging of some parents.

07:51.804 --> 07:54.932
-Parents asked you to go to the police?
-I talked to a Detective Barr.

07:55.016 --> 07:57.602
He said they'd look into it,
write something up.

07:57.727 --> 07:58.769
That was five months ago.

07:58.853 --> 08:01.731
-Have you seen a report?
-No, it's like the whole thing went away.

08:01.814 --> 08:03.399
Maybe you could check in with him.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.486
This isn't exactly my area.

08:06.569 --> 08:09.405
-[school bell rings]
-This is what you were talking about.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.283
At least by our definition
at the Behavioral Science Unit,

08:12.366 --> 08:14.494
tickling is not considered
deviant behavior.

08:14.577 --> 08:16.370
Deviant? You said "disturbing."

08:17.455 --> 08:20.082
Whatever's going on here
is obviously nuanced.

08:20.583 --> 08:23.252
I'd have to witness it
or at least get his version.

08:24.045 --> 08:26.506
-Do you have children?
-Not yet.

08:27.215 --> 08:29.550
Imagine one of those seven-year-olds
is yours.

08:30.009 --> 08:34.222
Principal Wade has her take off her shoes
and socks so that he can tickle her feet.

08:34.305 --> 08:37.350
Wouldn't you be worried one day
he'd ask her to take something else off?

08:38.809 --> 08:40.186
Put a call in, please?

08:42.813 --> 08:43.814

-Patrick?
-Yeah, you know, from my psych class.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.029

-Put ice in it.
-Gross.

09:39.036 --> 09:40.329
[sighs] Okay, Dad.

09:41.789 --> 09:42.915
I would've picked you up.

At school?
No, it's way too far out of your way.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.380
So what happened to your car?

09:50.006 --> 09:52.550
Uh... maintenance.

09:52.633 --> 09:55.261
You, Debbie Mitford,
took your car in for maintenance?

09:55.845 --> 09:58.556
I've kind of been forgetting
to put oil in it.

09:59.473 --> 10:00.474
You seized your engine?

10:01.225 --> 10:02.351
Something like that.

10:03.227 --> 10:06.063
The guys at the shop gave me
enough grief, so you don't have to.

10:06.147 --> 10:07.940
I don't think I can not give you grief.

10:08.024 --> 10:10.318
My dad used to remind me
to change my oil.

10:10.401 --> 10:11.611
Maybe you could do the same.

10:11.694 --> 10:13.070
Maybe get Patrick to remind you.

10:13.487 --> 10:15.281
You are so stupid.

Why is it so hard to stay mad at you?

-You don't think it's harmless fun?
-No, it's creepy and disgusting.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.213
I would not want any principal
touching my kid's feet.

10:31.964 --> 10:35.301
He seems like a good guy.
And he's been great for that school.

10:35.384 --> 10:36.969
Did the superintendent talk to him?

10:37.053 --> 10:39.347
I don't know. I should ask. [spits]

10:39.430 --> 10:41.057
[water running]

10:41.140 --> 10:43.643
My cousin had this first grade teacher
who would give her a sticker

10:43.726 --> 10:46.854
if she'd let him pinch her cheek.
He did it to all the girls.

10:46.937 --> 10:50.191
It only came out years later that he was
pinching some of them in other places.

10:50.274 --> 10:52.401
-Was he ever caught?
-No.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.029
She didn't find out until her classmates
started comparing notes

10:55.112 --> 10:56.155
at a high school reunion.

10:56.906 --> 10:59.200
Kids won't talk about that stuff
when they're little.

10:59.283 --> 11:01.994
They assume the adult is right,
especially if he's an authority figure.

11:02.078 --> 11:03.996
I wonder how many girls he did that to.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.916
Well, he was a teacher for 40 years.

11:06.999 --> 11:08.709
[sighs] I can't believe
it didn't come out.

11:08.793 --> 11:11.295
There were whispers,
but by that point he was retired.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.255
It's escalating behavior...

11:13.839 --> 11:15.800
just like with Brudos and Roger.

11:20.179 --> 11:24.683
Almost like they can't help themselves.
They've got this... compulsion.

You think Roger is in any way
similar to Brudos?

11:28.396 --> 11:30.147
Both of them sure like these.

-[Holden] Know Detective Barr?

12:10.563 --> 12:13.774
Staff politics. Women like that
are always looking for a pot to stir.

12:13.858 --> 12:15.734
She seemed genuinely concerned.

12:15.818 --> 12:19.989
-She wasn't married, as I remember.
-What does that have to do with it?

12:20.072 --> 12:21.240
She's got extra energy.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.659
Apparently,
some parents are concerned, too.

12:23.742 --> 12:27.371
-She said that, but I never saw them.
-Did you follow up at all?

12:27.455 --> 12:30.166
There's no victim.
No one's pressing charges.

12:30.249 --> 12:31.625
He's touching kids.

12:31.709 --> 12:33.252
Giving them money for it.

12:33.335 --> 12:36.297
He's tickling kids, that's not a crime.

12:36.839 --> 12:39.175
I can't arrest him
unless he does something illegal.

12:39.258 --> 12:42.970
I explained this to Ms. Ebner,
I shouldn't have to explain it to the FBI.

12:43.512 --> 12:46.015
Unless you're gonna start predicting
what people do.

12:47.892 --> 12:49.351
May I see the report?

12:51.687 --> 12:54.398
-Why am I reading this?
-I thought we might look into it.

It could be a form of podophilia...

with no record.

No one will help them.

-Just one teacher.
-No.

Some members of the school board
have been complaining.

13:08.996 --> 13:11.874
[sighs] Holden, we have
a stack of applications to review.

13:11.957 --> 13:13.584
I don't see your stack getting shorter.

13:13.667 --> 13:16.754
-I looked at them, all "nos."
-No as in, don't even interview?

13:16.837 --> 13:19.215
-They're greenhorns.
-So were you.

13:19.298 --> 13:21.717
We mainly need someone
to take over transcribing.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.677
They're all gunning to talk
to lust murderers.

13:23.761 --> 13:25.471
They bring nothing to the table.

13:26.180 --> 13:27.014
Tell Wendy.

13:28.390 --> 13:29.517
Okay.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.023
How's this?

13:42.613 --> 13:44.448
Want me to take us
to the airport tomorrow?

13:44.532 --> 13:47.660
I decided last night. I'm not going.

13:47.743 --> 13:49.995
-What?
-I'm not going back to Oregon.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.164
You expect me to interview Brudos alone?

13:52.248 --> 13:53.290
If you want.

13:53.374 --> 13:55.793
But we were just getting him to open up.

13:55.876 --> 13:57.127
That's why I'm not going.

13:57.211 --> 13:59.004
When did you get so fragile?

13:59.088 --> 14:00.464
[scoffs]

14:01.006 --> 14:03.676
Bill... I do not want to do this alone.

14:03.759 --> 14:06.428
So don't. We have a ton of material
from last time.

14:06.512 --> 14:07.638
Not nearly enough.

14:07.721 --> 14:10.599
-I just came up with a whole new strategy.
-Go for it.

14:11.850 --> 14:13.394
You're really not coming.

14:14.228 --> 14:15.437
I'm really not coming.

14:16.438 --> 14:20.442
Okay. Then I'll just show him that
one of us isn't a big, fat, fucking pussy.

14:21.193 --> 14:23.529
Yeah. Show him that.

14:48.762 --> 14:50.931
[clicking]

14:53.225 --> 14:54.059
Hi.

14:56.228 --> 14:58.314
-Something wrong?
-I can't close my recorder.

14:58.397 --> 14:59.523
Give it to me.

15:00.441 --> 15:01.483
Thank you.

15:02.318 --> 15:03.736
I'm pretty handy.

15:04.904 --> 15:09.658
I'm one of the only... inmates

15:09.742 --> 15:12.202
they allow in hobby shop.

15:12.286 --> 15:13.329
Really?

15:13.412 --> 15:16.749
Yeah. I can use scissors
under supervision.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.543
Leather boring tools.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.962
The parole board should really
take that into account.

15:22.046 --> 15:24.298
-And we're live.
-Okay.

15:24.381 --> 15:26.050
So, uh, today...

15:26.800 --> 15:29.178
-I'd like to pick up with things--
-Where's Bill?

15:30.721 --> 15:33.057
-He couldn't be here this time.
-Did I scare him off?

15:33.140 --> 15:34.183
No. Uh...

15:34.266 --> 15:36.352
We're doing some hiring
back at the office.

15:36.435 --> 15:37.853
Fresh meat for the mill?

15:38.979 --> 15:40.856
-That's exactly right.
-[chuckles]

15:43.901 --> 15:45.152
Bill, I miss you.

15:45.611 --> 15:47.029
Please come back.

15:47.529 --> 15:48.906
[laughs]

15:50.366 --> 15:53.702
Okay. I'd like to take it from the murder
of the second girl, Jane Weber.

15:53.786 --> 15:54.620
Okay.

15:54.703 --> 15:57.122
Her car broke down on the highway,
you pulled over.

15:57.206 --> 15:59.458
-Yeah, helped her out.
-How did you help her?

15:59.959 --> 16:02.211
Said, "Let's go home,
we'll call a mechanic."

16:02.795 --> 16:04.380
-Home to your house?
-Yeah.

16:04.463 --> 16:07.633
-Did you call the mechanic?
-Didn't get that far.

16:08.258 --> 16:09.093
Why not?

16:09.176 --> 16:11.178
She was interested in my photography.

16:12.596 --> 16:14.848
-Did she also want to be a model?
-Yeah.

16:15.391 --> 16:17.643
Funny how all these girls you met
wanted that.

16:17.726 --> 16:19.812
Women like men to pay attention to 'em.

16:20.479 --> 16:21.730
So, did you...

16:22.690 --> 16:25.234
-Invited her to the garage.
-Mm-hmm.

16:25.317 --> 16:27.152
-Took some photos--
-What kind of photos?

16:27.236 --> 16:28.654
You know, headshots.

16:29.947 --> 16:31.824
Right. And after these headshots...

16:31.907 --> 16:33.742
She decided to walk home.

16:34.702 --> 16:36.453
And that's the last you saw of her.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.580
Last anyone saw of her,
as far as I remember.

16:39.373 --> 16:42.876
Her body was found in the Willamette River
tied to an auto transmission

16:42.960 --> 16:44.169
to weigh it down.

16:44.878 --> 16:47.131
The transmission was traced back
to a car that you owned.

16:47.214 --> 16:48.340
Yeah, I know.

16:50.467 --> 16:51.510
You have any smokes?

16:52.594 --> 16:53.595
Yeah.

16:54.471 --> 16:56.890
So was that all part of the police plot?

16:56.974 --> 16:58.017
Oh, yeah.

16:58.517 --> 17:01.937
The transmission, the photos, the foot...
all of it.

17:04.481 --> 17:05.566
Well...

17:06.900 --> 17:08.777
someone killed those girls.

17:09.653 --> 17:11.989
Yeah, I know.
I have a whole theory about that.

17:12.573 --> 17:13.574
Really?

17:14.116 --> 17:15.075
Let's hear it.

17:15.159 --> 17:19.288
Well... these girls are disappearing.

17:19.371 --> 17:21.790
Body parts showing up in the river.
Police get involved.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.877
The killer realizes
things are heating up and splits.

17:25.335 --> 17:30.215
Probably chopping up girls
in Seattle, Idaho, Canada, as we speak.

17:30.299 --> 17:32.259
Meanwhile, they need to blame someone.

17:32.676 --> 17:34.595
They catch me
sniffing around some coeds.

17:34.678 --> 17:36.346
I'm not saying I'm an angel.

17:36.472 --> 17:38.432
Search my house,
find a few pairs of shoes,

17:38.515 --> 17:41.018
decide I'm their fall guy.

17:42.019 --> 17:45.272
Everyone feels safe, DA gets re-elected,
yada yada yada.

17:46.398 --> 17:49.485
It is a pretty big coincidence
that you met a couple of the girls

17:49.568 --> 17:50.736
that became his victims.

17:50.819 --> 17:52.029
Huge coincidence.

17:54.198 --> 17:57.284
Do you think that he...
planned his attacks?

18:00.412 --> 18:03.290
Maybe the first one fell into his lap,

18:03.832 --> 18:07.961
but then maybe after that,
he got a taste for it.

18:08.045 --> 18:10.631
Oh. Now that's interesting.

18:10.714 --> 18:13.509
Because there were no photos
of the first girl, right?

18:15.302 --> 18:18.138
But the other three,
it was like he was prepared.

18:20.015 --> 18:23.811
Do you think
that even before the first one,

18:23.894 --> 18:26.730
he fantasized about murdering a woman?

18:26.814 --> 18:27.940
Definitely.

18:29.608 --> 18:31.360
What do you think he fantasized about?

18:33.028 --> 18:35.739
Choking them, chopping them up,
all that stuff they said I did.

18:36.657 --> 18:40.702
So the murders were just an extension
of thoughts he already had,

18:40.786 --> 18:42.037
maybe for a long time.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.623
You'd have to think about it pretty hard
to go through with it.

18:44.706 --> 18:47.668
You'd have to be... driven. [laughs]

18:47.751 --> 18:49.294
You mean like, out of control?

18:49.878 --> 18:53.882
Maybe his real life was out of control,
but his fantasy life was...

18:53.966 --> 18:57.469
A... place where he could feel powerful.

18:57.553 --> 18:59.304
-Makes sense.
-But then why--

19:01.265 --> 19:02.391
For example...

19:03.809 --> 19:05.894
Laura Sullivan was hit from behind.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.564
Jane Weber was choked from behind.

19:09.523 --> 19:11.150
Why would he do it that way?

19:13.193 --> 19:14.945
Didn't want them looking at him?

19:16.113 --> 19:17.114
Why not?

19:18.031 --> 19:21.451
It might not have been
about watching them die.

19:21.535 --> 19:24.580
You know, because then
he would have tortured them, right?

19:24.955 --> 19:28.584
It might just been
about having them quiet.

19:30.377 --> 19:33.130
So that he could play with them?

19:33.213 --> 19:36.341
Like you'd play with a doll?

19:36.842 --> 19:40.512
Yeah, there were all these photos of 'em
in different positions.

19:40.596 --> 19:42.264
-Have intercourse with them?
-Sure.

19:42.347 --> 19:45.058
But then he played with some of them
before they died, as well.

19:45.142 --> 19:49.396
Kathy Schmidt was photographed
in a piece of lingerie that was not hers.

19:49.479 --> 19:51.190
Oh, she probably liked that.

19:51.732 --> 19:54.193
Well, she was kidnapped
from a parking garage.

19:54.276 --> 19:56.069
How do you know she was kidnapped?

19:56.403 --> 19:58.071
You think she went willingly?

19:59.406 --> 20:01.617
All I'm saying is, all the women I meet...

20:02.201 --> 20:03.327
Want to be models.

20:04.620 --> 20:08.165
So do you think that with Kathy Schmidt
it was consensual,

20:08.248 --> 20:11.376
she didn't realize
that she was going to be killed?

20:12.419 --> 20:14.463
She may have been getting the feeling,
you know.

20:14.546 --> 20:17.925
I mean, he may have made it clear
at a certain point

20:18.008 --> 20:21.511
that she needed to take the pictures
if she wanted him to let her go.

20:22.638 --> 20:24.681
-She was playing along.
-Yeah.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.976
Do you think the killer enjoyed that, too?

20:28.977 --> 20:31.188
He might've thought that's what you get.

20:31.647 --> 20:34.816
That's what you get
when you want to be a model?

20:35.734 --> 20:37.861
When you want people to look at you.

20:42.115 --> 20:44.952
Do you think that the killer
found it exciting to, uh...

20:45.786 --> 20:49.122
get some of that control
back in his real life?

20:49.206 --> 20:50.374
Oh, yeah.

20:50.457 --> 20:52.167
Probably made him want more.

20:53.543 --> 20:55.671
After he got a taste for it,
like you said.

20:55.754 --> 20:57.339
After he got a taste.

20:59.132 --> 21:02.302
I guess...
we all have fantasies, don't we?

21:03.136 --> 21:05.597
I can remember my first fantasy of girls.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.057
[Brudos chuckles]

21:07.140 --> 21:08.100
What, um...

21:10.310 --> 21:11.853
What was your first fantasy?

21:11.937 --> 21:13.689
Oh... [exhales]

21:15.023 --> 21:17.359
Must have been... nine or ten.

21:19.403 --> 21:22.281
There was a woman in a tunnel.
I'd trapped her there.

21:24.074 --> 21:27.369
She was like this white shape
in the darkness.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.705
I made her do things.

21:30.580 --> 21:33.250
At that point, there wasn't even
anything sexual about it.

21:33.333 --> 21:35.002
I just remember her...

21:36.003 --> 21:40.173
begging for... mercy.

21:43.176 --> 21:45.053
Do you still have fantasies, Jerry?

21:48.807 --> 21:50.309
No. I don't.

21:51.685 --> 21:53.478
Tell the parole board that.

21:58.525 --> 22:00.527
Day three, he takes the stand.

22:00.610 --> 22:02.487
Now we knew he was lying,

22:02.571 --> 22:04.323
but it could've gone either way

22:04.406 --> 22:06.616
because he had two other Klansmen
to back him up.

22:06.700 --> 22:09.077
So after lunch,
I waited for cross-examination.

22:09.161 --> 22:11.204
I slide right behind his girlfriend.

22:11.288 --> 22:13.457
I drape my arm
across the back of her bench,

22:13.540 --> 22:15.417
I lean in real close, so, uh...

22:19.171 --> 22:20.672
The guy's eyes bug out.

22:20.756 --> 22:23.550
He starts stammering,
he comes completely unglued,

22:23.633 --> 22:25.719
-and we get a conviction.
-[Carr] Amazing.

22:25.802 --> 22:28.221
-[man] Thirteen years. [laughs]
-[Tench] That is great.

22:28.305 --> 22:29.681
Great stories, Jim.

22:30.307 --> 22:31.933
So nice to meet you.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.894
Thanks for coming
all the way up from Atlanta.

22:33.977 --> 22:35.854
Word is out y'all are onto something big.

22:35.937 --> 22:38.899
-I couldn't wait to see for myself.
-[Carr] I hope we lived up to the hype.

22:38.982 --> 22:40.567
Oh, you surpassed it.

22:42.110 --> 22:45.072
We have to meet a few more people,
but we can let you know soon.

22:45.155 --> 22:47.949
I'll say it one more time,
I'd love to join the team.

22:48.033 --> 22:50.202
-We'd love to have you.
-Thank you.

22:59.461 --> 23:00.629
He's black.

23:00.712 --> 23:02.005
Nothing gets past you.

23:02.631 --> 23:05.133
He's our best candidate.
I think we should hire him.

23:05.217 --> 23:09.429
Our list of potential subjects are 80,
90 percent white and probably racist.

23:09.513 --> 23:10.764
Does that mean no?

23:10.847 --> 23:13.391
He could incite a response
that affects the study.

23:13.475 --> 23:14.559
That means no.

23:15.352 --> 23:18.355
Don't put that on his assessment.
We can't be seen as racists.

23:18.438 --> 23:20.315
I thought our newbies
would be transcribing.

23:20.398 --> 23:21.233
Did Brudos behave?

23:22.484 --> 23:23.735
He was almost pleasant.

23:24.277 --> 23:26.446
Seems repeat visits are important.

23:27.364 --> 23:29.950
Did you confide in him
about your cum sock?

23:30.826 --> 23:33.328
Our new team member
will train with transcription,

23:33.411 --> 23:36.039
but we're looking for someone
that has operations experience

23:36.123 --> 23:38.333
so that we can expand
our subjects' interviews.

23:38.416 --> 23:40.961
-Especially if Bill keeps wussing out.
-Stop whining.

23:41.628 --> 23:42.754
How many have you seen?

23:42.838 --> 23:45.757
Oh, I didn't think you were interested
in the process.

23:47.259 --> 23:50.095
Well, look, the gang's all here. Come in.

23:50.178 --> 23:52.931
This is Gregg Smith,
he's one of your candidates.

23:53.014 --> 23:55.934
Gregg's done a lot of work in the field,
he's a talented agent.

23:56.017 --> 23:58.854
His dad and I studied pre-law together
at Dartmouth.

23:59.646 --> 24:01.356
I hope you give him a good shake.

24:09.489 --> 24:14.119
It's dark and all I see
is his knuckles gripping the stock,

24:14.202 --> 24:17.247
and he's yelling,
"Halt! Police! Drop the gun!"

24:17.747 --> 24:20.834
-I realize this guy is about to shoot me.
-Whoa.

24:21.668 --> 24:24.713
And then I hear Mike yell,
"He's an FBI agent!"

24:25.505 --> 24:26.673
He saved my life.

24:27.507 --> 24:29.759
Because I was frozen, I couldn't speak.

24:29.843 --> 24:32.929
Uniform lowers his shotgun,
and we take off again after the driver.

24:33.013 --> 24:36.099
Mike catches him and nearly beats
the flimflam out of him

24:36.183 --> 24:39.269
because he's so keyed up
after watching me almost get blown away.

24:39.352 --> 24:42.564
I had to pull him off the guy.
But anyway...

24:43.732 --> 24:44.691
a great partner.

24:44.774 --> 24:48.195
Well, you did your partner a good deed.
I bet he's grateful.

24:48.278 --> 24:52.282
The guys call me "The Padre"
and they come to confession at my desk.

24:52.365 --> 24:53.700
You Catholic?

24:54.701 --> 24:56.661
My mother's Catholic, my father's Quaker.

24:56.745 --> 24:58.622
-[Tench] No shit.
-How does that work?

24:59.206 --> 25:01.875
Our family joke was that
we'd never run out of guilt or oats.

25:01.958 --> 25:03.960
-[Tench laughs]
-[Carr] Are you religious?

25:04.044 --> 25:05.545
-Yes, ma'am.
-Dr. Carr.

25:06.338 --> 25:07.172
Doctor. Yes.

25:07.839 --> 25:11.384
I have to admit that as a kid
I leaned toward the drama of the Church.

25:11.468 --> 25:13.637
The organ, the incense,

25:13.720 --> 25:15.972
Jesus rising from the dead Easter morning.

25:16.056 --> 25:18.266
Do you believe that Jesus
rose from the dead?

25:18.350 --> 25:20.977
I am Christian. So is my wife.

25:21.561 --> 25:23.688
She's Catholic.
We've already got two little girls.

25:23.772 --> 25:25.857
We're trying to slow-play
the whole big family thing.

25:25.941 --> 25:27.359
Good and evil, right and wrong?

25:27.442 --> 25:30.445
-Are these concepts that you believe in?
-Yes, I do.

25:30.528 --> 25:32.822
Binary thinking could hamstring you

25:32.906 --> 25:35.367
when it comes to critical assessment
of our subjects.

25:35.450 --> 25:37.452
We need to understand the gray areas.

25:37.535 --> 25:41.539
The world is complex, I get that.
I can check my judgment at the door.

25:41.623 --> 25:44.960
The people we work with have done things
you don't even want to imagine.

25:45.043 --> 25:47.963
-I've read some of your cases.
-[Holden] It's one thing to read about it.

25:48.046 --> 25:51.174
It's another to sit three feet away
from a guy who's delighted to tell you

25:51.258 --> 25:53.927
how hard it was to stick his dick
in his mother's neck

25:54.010 --> 25:55.345
after he sawed off her head.

25:57.597 --> 25:59.516
What made you apply for the study?

26:00.934 --> 26:01.768
My daughters.

26:03.061 --> 26:05.188
When I hear about girls disappearing...

26:06.106 --> 26:09.401
This may sound corny, but I want to make
the world a safer place for them.

26:10.068 --> 26:13.405
He's smart. He's a family guy.
He knows what's at stake.

26:13.488 --> 26:16.741
Ugh! He's got you wrapped
around his little Ivy League finger.

26:16.825 --> 26:18.868
-You think it's an act?
-He's a mole for Shepard.

26:18.952 --> 26:20.161
-Come on.
-[Holden] I'm serious.

26:20.245 --> 26:22.372
When's the last time
Shepard came down here?

26:22.455 --> 26:25.667
He's trying to make sure we're not
smearing the good name of the FBI.

26:25.750 --> 26:27.585
Don't kid yourself. We need Shepard.

26:27.669 --> 26:31.131
His heart's in the right place.
I think Agent Smith is earnest.

26:31.214 --> 26:34.426
-And that's a good thing?
-What about a trial period?

26:34.509 --> 26:36.761
To see
if we can beat the flimflam out of him?

27:48.708 --> 27:49.834
What's going on?

27:50.960 --> 27:52.170
Just seeing what he can take.

27:53.129 --> 27:56.007
-[Tench] What do you got him on?
-[Holden] Bittaker and Norris.

27:57.467 --> 28:01.513
-Are you trying to get rid of this guy?
-So listen. This thing with Roger Wade...

28:01.596 --> 28:04.140
-Who?
-The principal at Shady Lane Elementary.

28:04.849 --> 28:05.683
The foot tickler?

28:05.767 --> 28:08.144
After I talked to the superintendent,
the school board had a meeting.

28:08.228 --> 28:10.980
-You've got to be kidding.
-They're begging us to look into it.

28:11.064 --> 28:13.358
-They're begging?
-They're... asking.

28:13.441 --> 28:16.403
Our LEAA review is coming up, what are
you still doing on this goose chase?

28:16.486 --> 28:19.614
Gregg can finish the paperwork.
Let's give this a day.

28:19.697 --> 28:22.450
-There are meaningful signs here.
-You're not dragging me into this.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.702
What's the point
if we don't apply it to the real world?

28:24.786 --> 28:28.581
We're trying to save women from getting
pulled into vans and cut to pieces,

28:28.665 --> 28:31.209
not crucify some schoolmarm
who hasn't done anything.

28:31.292 --> 28:34.462
Yet.
Certainly our goal is to be preemptive.

28:35.255 --> 28:37.882
We're the FBI, Holden.
That is not our goal.

28:38.675 --> 28:39.634
Yet.

28:48.268 --> 28:51.229
[high-pitched noise from headphones]

28:52.063 --> 28:53.022
[Holden] So...

28:54.607 --> 28:56.025
still want this job?

28:57.068 --> 29:00.196
The students certainly don't complain.
They enjoy the contact.

29:00.280 --> 29:03.074
Yes, but as you said to me
when I was here before,

29:03.158 --> 29:04.784
it might be best for parents
to determine--

29:04.868 --> 29:06.661
We are a community.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.997
And I want the children to know that.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.623
In the five years that I've been here,

29:10.707 --> 29:13.334
their test scores have gone up
almost 30 percent.

29:13.418 --> 29:15.462
And it's not because
I'm a strict disciplinarian,

29:15.545 --> 29:18.131
or I pile on the homework,
or I cut recess.

29:18.715 --> 29:22.427
It is because I apply a personal touch.

29:22.927 --> 29:25.638
-These children matter to me.
-That is quite clear.

29:25.722 --> 29:29.100
We have special games, sports,

29:29.184 --> 29:31.853
art projects, teamwork activities.

29:31.936 --> 29:34.731
I am teaching happiness.

29:34.814 --> 29:37.650
With all of that, why the need to tickle?

29:38.485 --> 29:40.403
All right, let me give you an example.

29:41.154 --> 29:43.198
We had this child, six years old,

29:43.281 --> 29:45.617
who said he sprained his ankle
playing kickball

29:45.700 --> 29:47.535
and didn't want to go to class.

29:47.619 --> 29:50.914
The nurse calls me down
because his ankle is not swollen,

29:50.997 --> 29:52.707
but he's still claiming that it hurts.

29:52.791 --> 29:55.919
Now... I don't want to call him a liar.

29:56.836 --> 29:59.464
So, I wiggle his big toe.

30:00.173 --> 30:02.383
Does it hurt when this little piggy
goes to market?

30:03.301 --> 30:07.055
How about when this little piggy
stays home? He smiles.

30:07.138 --> 30:09.599
He says that it tickles.
So I tickle his feet.

30:09.682 --> 30:12.268
The next thing I know, he's laughing.

30:12.352 --> 30:15.313
He's happy, he goes back to class.

30:15.396 --> 30:18.107
-Did you also give him a nickel?
-I'm sure I did.

30:18.191 --> 30:21.027
So the next time he goes to the store,
he can get himself--

30:21.361 --> 30:24.197
-What can you get for a nickel these days?
-A piece of bubble gum?

30:24.280 --> 30:25.365
Exactly.

30:26.533 --> 30:29.410
Agent Ford,
you're blowing this out of proportion.

30:29.911 --> 30:31.830
[Holden]  We need to work
on your interview technique.

30:31.913 --> 30:34.666
-Sorry, was I supposed to be hard on him?
-You shouldn't team up.

30:36.042 --> 30:38.628
Did you think that "piggy goes to market"
stuff was weird?

30:38.711 --> 30:41.005
Oh, my kids love
"Piggy Goes to the Market."

30:41.089 --> 30:44.008
-Yeah, your kids love it from you.
-A tickle's a tickle.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.804
Maybe that's all it is, but...

30:49.013 --> 30:53.518
if there is a sexual angle,
Roger would no doubt be good at hiding it.

30:54.435 --> 30:56.604
When Kemper went in
for his last psychiatric evaluation,

30:56.688 --> 30:59.941
he had a 15-year-old girl's head
in the trunk of his car.

31:00.817 --> 31:03.570
It gave him a thrill to persuade
the committee successfully

31:03.653 --> 31:05.446
that he was over
his psychological problems,

31:05.530 --> 31:07.156
knowing that he had a trophy outside.

31:08.241 --> 31:09.617
Isn't that kind of extreme?

31:09.701 --> 31:12.120
-[children chattering]
-You get the idea.

31:15.582 --> 31:19.085
I'm glad Janet finally did something.
Someone had to.

31:19.168 --> 31:21.254
So you don't approve of Roger's behavior?

31:21.337 --> 31:24.048
I've always thought
that tickling was bizarre enough,

31:24.549 --> 31:26.259
but I get parents coming to me,

31:26.342 --> 31:28.928
asking why their children
suddenly have pocket change.

31:29.012 --> 31:30.680
How long has this gone on for?

31:30.763 --> 31:32.640
I've only been at Shady Lane two years.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.809
It sounds like it goes back
further than that.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.270
Why are parents complaining to you?
Why not go to Roger?

31:37.353 --> 31:41.399
He brushes them off, he's unapologetic,
and he's a big deal around here.

31:42.066 --> 31:44.527
I agreed to meet with you
so I could share my thoughts,

31:44.611 --> 31:46.321
but I hope it doesn't get back to him.

31:46.404 --> 31:48.698
-You think he'd retaliate?
-I don't know.

31:48.781 --> 31:51.492
It's a small school,
everyone seems to know about the tickling.

31:51.576 --> 31:53.870
How do the children respond
to his tickling?

31:53.953 --> 31:55.204
They endure it.

31:55.288 --> 31:57.248
They know they're going to get paid.

31:57.582 --> 31:59.375
I have students coming back
from his office,

31:59.459 --> 32:01.127
showing off their earnings.

32:01.210 --> 32:03.463
What did you think of Roger
when you first came here,

32:03.546 --> 32:05.173
before you knew about this?

32:06.174 --> 32:07.675
I thought he was smug.

32:08.384 --> 32:10.970
I transferred because I heard
how great this place is,

32:11.054 --> 32:13.473
but then that's all he talks about.

32:13.556 --> 32:15.433
He really toots his own horn.

32:15.892 --> 32:18.144
The teachers are supposed
to be cheerleaders.

32:18.353 --> 32:21.397
And I've always been uncomfortable
with how he handles the children.

32:21.481 --> 32:24.192
-What do you mean?
-He's always fussing over them.

32:24.275 --> 32:25.151
[Holden] "Fussing"?

32:25.234 --> 32:28.363
Well, it's always touchy-touchy
and cutesey-cutesey. [scoffs]

32:29.280 --> 32:31.950
Mrs. Clark, could you make a list
of parents and teachers

32:32.033 --> 32:33.451
that feel the same way?

32:34.202 --> 32:35.536
We're meeting with a handful,

32:35.620 --> 32:38.206
but we'd like to get a sense
of the whole picture.

32:40.041 --> 32:41.209
Is something wrong?

32:41.292 --> 32:44.379
I don't want a witch hunt.
I'm not vindictive.

32:44.921 --> 32:46.381
I just wish he'd listen.

32:46.923 --> 32:48.383
[woman]  The students love Roger.

32:48.466 --> 32:51.886
When he visits the class,
I know it's going to be an easier day.

32:51.970 --> 32:55.306
He can turn a moody room
into an eager one just by walking in.

32:55.390 --> 32:57.016
You've heard about the tickling?

32:57.100 --> 32:58.434
Of course.

32:58.518 --> 33:00.603
When my kids come back from his office,
they seem happy.

33:00.687 --> 33:01.854
What do you think about it?

33:01.938 --> 33:02.939
It's wonderful.

33:03.439 --> 33:05.274
He turns punishment into play.

33:05.358 --> 33:07.318
He makes it a positive experience.

33:07.402 --> 33:10.780
-Nothing could be better for them.
-Have you had any parent complaints?

33:10.863 --> 33:14.742
The parents I've talked to are thrilled.
Except about property taxes.

33:14.826 --> 33:17.370
Shady Lane has made this
a desirable neighborhood.

33:18.121 --> 33:19.622
What do you think of Janet Ebner?

33:20.748 --> 33:24.252
Well, I don't like to speak ill of people,
but she's a busybody.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.838
What do you think of Mrs. Clark?

33:26.921 --> 33:27.755
She's a crab.

33:29.757 --> 33:32.135
Okay. I think that's all we need.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.513
-Thank you for talking with us.
-Thank you.

33:35.596 --> 33:37.598
-So nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

33:39.642 --> 33:42.478
He came home from Steve's house
and his tongue was blue.

33:42.979 --> 33:46.399
It's not like Steve's mom
to give him candy, so I questioned him.

33:46.482 --> 33:50.153
Found out they walked to the corner store
without asking, and bought Pop Rocks.

33:50.236 --> 33:51.821
Boys will be boys.

33:51.904 --> 33:53.114
That's not the point.

33:54.449 --> 33:58.995
We're, uh, in discussions about how much
leeway Jason is allowed at this age.

33:59.620 --> 34:03.708
Anyway, he's evasive when I ask him
where he got the money.

34:03.791 --> 34:07.670
So, I call Steve's mom. She's having
the same conversation with her son.

34:07.754 --> 34:09.922
Turns out they got it from Roger.

34:10.006 --> 34:11.340
The principal...

34:11.424 --> 34:13.634
giving them money
without telling the parents.

34:13.718 --> 34:18.139
But then we find out, and this is why
Jason wouldn't tell me in the first place,

34:18.765 --> 34:20.516
he and Steve were fighting
on the playground--

34:20.600 --> 34:22.894
They were kicking mud at each other,
they weren't fighting.

34:22.977 --> 34:26.355
They were fighting,
they got sent to Roger's office.

34:26.439 --> 34:30.026
He seats them side by side,
makes them take off their shoes and socks,

34:30.109 --> 34:32.862
and does this double tickling thing.

34:32.945 --> 34:35.031
Was Jason uncomfortable with the tickling?

34:35.114 --> 34:37.408
I don't think Jason understood
that it was inappropriate.

34:37.492 --> 34:40.661
No, he wasn't uncomfortable.
The boys made up again, all buddy-buddy.

34:40.745 --> 34:43.081
But they're nine-year-olds. Almost ten.

34:43.581 --> 34:46.125
I could see it if they were toddlers,
if this was preschool.

34:46.209 --> 34:47.668
And then there's the money.

34:47.752 --> 34:50.254
-And you went to Roger?
-[man] Yeah. We sat down with him.

34:50.338 --> 34:52.673
He made it sound like
we were perverts for even asking.

34:52.757 --> 34:57.303
How dare we deny our boy
the, um, affection that he provides?

34:57.386 --> 35:00.223
Something like that.
I came away with the strangest feeling.

35:00.306 --> 35:03.684
Yeah, I mean, if you don't want people
touching your kid--

35:03.768 --> 35:06.062
A middle-aged man
touching your child's feet.

35:06.145 --> 35:08.356
You should be able to tell them stop.

35:08.439 --> 35:09.816
Did you ask him to stop?

35:09.899 --> 35:12.860
-Absolutely. And he said--
-Oh, yeah, listen to this.

35:13.903 --> 35:17.156
"My covenant is not with you,
it's with your son."

35:17.240 --> 35:19.200
"Covenant"? He used that word?

35:19.283 --> 35:20.535
[woman] Yes.

35:20.618 --> 35:21.744
Is he religious?

35:21.828 --> 35:23.996
-I don't know.
-[Gregg] It's an odd choice.

35:24.080 --> 35:25.289
The whole thing is odd.

35:28.000 --> 35:29.752
What do you think
should be done about him?

35:30.920 --> 35:32.463
Well, I thought about suing.

35:32.880 --> 35:35.091
We want to protect Jason,

35:35.174 --> 35:36.634
but we aren't sure.

35:37.260 --> 35:40.346
And he wasn't traumatized.
I mean, quite the opposite.

35:40.429 --> 35:43.808
We thought you might have suggestions,
because we don't know what to do.

35:44.475 --> 35:45.560
Yeah, we don't know.

35:45.643 --> 35:47.395
That's the third set of parents
who don't like it.

35:47.478 --> 35:49.814
-I guess they should have a say.
-I think they should.

35:49.897 --> 35:52.233
But is there anything going on?
Is Roger dangerous?

35:52.316 --> 35:54.235
Everyone seems to agree
the children don't mind.

35:54.318 --> 35:55.570
What about when one does?

35:55.653 --> 35:57.989
Brudos kept his urges in check
until something triggered him.

35:58.072 --> 35:59.866
After that, everything escalated.

35:59.949 --> 36:02.618
-What if a kid decides to resist Roger?
-I read the Brudos files.

36:02.702 --> 36:06.080
-He had a history of offenses.
-It's a leap, but there is a correlation.

36:06.164 --> 36:09.625
I don't think Roger can help himself
any more than Brudos could stop killing.

36:09.709 --> 36:13.754
In fact, giving them money might encourage
them to go to his office for "punishment."

36:14.338 --> 36:16.299
-Why don't we ask him to stop?
-People have.

36:16.382 --> 36:19.093
Let's tell him then.
We're the fucking FBI.

36:37.737 --> 36:41.866
[Roger]  Let's see if Mrs. Lane can come by
in the morning, before school.

36:42.491 --> 36:45.536
It's her first year
and I think she's having some trouble

36:45.620 --> 36:46.954
managing her students.

36:47.038 --> 36:48.414
Mr. Wade, can we talk?

36:49.582 --> 36:51.083
And, um, let's make a note

36:51.167 --> 36:53.169
-I've signed off on the lesson plan--
-In private?

36:55.630 --> 36:56.631
Thank you.

37:04.680 --> 37:06.515
After speaking with parents and teachers,

37:06.599 --> 37:09.268
we're advising you
to stop touching the children.

37:09.352 --> 37:10.353
Advising me?

37:10.436 --> 37:14.232
[Holden] It's a trivial activity.
Simply stopping will satisfy everyone.

37:14.315 --> 37:15.775
It is not trivial.

37:15.858 --> 37:18.236
Don't make me sound
like some stranger in a raincoat.

37:18.319 --> 37:19.946
We're here at the request
of the superintendent.

37:20.029 --> 37:20.905
Really?

37:21.948 --> 37:25.660
The superintendent of the schools
sent the FBI to advise me

37:25.743 --> 37:27.745
to stop tickling children?

37:29.163 --> 37:30.831
I have been a principal for 15 years.

37:30.915 --> 37:34.794
There hasn't been a shadow on my record
until now. How dare you.

37:35.503 --> 37:40.258
How dare you accuse me of being
inappropriate with my own students.

37:40.341 --> 37:42.551
We're not accusing you.
Some people are uncomfortable.

37:42.635 --> 37:43.636
You are!

37:44.262 --> 37:46.555
You are uncomfortable, Agent Ford.
Why is that?

37:46.639 --> 37:49.350
When I was here for Career Day,
you asked me to edit my speech.

37:49.433 --> 37:52.228
You were worried how it would affect
the teachers and students. So I did.

37:52.311 --> 37:54.563
I heard your concerns,
I followed your advice.

37:54.647 --> 37:58.359
I am advising you to hear the concerns
of your teachers and your school board--

37:58.442 --> 38:01.904
You didn't know what the hell
you were doing that day. You still don't.

38:02.405 --> 38:04.490
"Deviant." "Torture." "Mutilation."

38:04.573 --> 38:07.827
That is your world,
and it has made you paranoid.

38:07.910 --> 38:10.204
That is not my school.

38:12.790 --> 38:13.958
Mr. Wade.

38:14.625 --> 38:16.794
I am telling you this for your own good.

38:18.879 --> 38:21.299
We all have to choose
between trust and fear.

38:21.632 --> 38:23.384
If you ever do have children,

38:23.634 --> 38:27.305
I hope that you'll think long and hard
about how you want to raise them.

38:31.976 --> 38:33.394
Did we do the right thing?

38:34.937 --> 38:36.480
Is this a federal issue?

38:49.410 --> 38:51.454
[doorbell buzzes]

38:57.460 --> 38:58.711
Hey.

38:58.794 --> 39:00.921
-You okay?
-[exhales]

39:02.298 --> 39:04.175
-What are you doing?
-Studying.

39:05.593 --> 39:06.469
Can I come in?

39:06.552 --> 39:07.762
I really need to study.

39:08.429 --> 39:09.430
Okay.

39:11.432 --> 39:14.435
-You really have to leave me alone.
-I will. I promise.

39:15.144 --> 39:16.896
You gotta promise-promise.

40:00.439 --> 40:01.399
What are you reading?

40:03.484 --> 40:06.404
The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life.

40:09.365 --> 40:11.534
-Sounds interesting.
-It is interesting.

40:13.702 --> 40:14.995
-What's it about?
-Please.

40:15.079 --> 40:17.289
You promised
and I really have to finish this.

40:21.669 --> 40:23.838
It could help
to describe what you're learning.

40:27.466 --> 40:28.676
Okay.

40:28.759 --> 40:30.511
It's by Erving Goffman.

40:30.594 --> 40:32.805
He posits that life is like theater.

40:32.888 --> 40:35.433
We tailor ourselves
to fit the parts that we're playing.

40:37.143 --> 40:38.018
Meaning?

40:38.102 --> 40:41.147
For instance, there's the expectation
that girls should be nice,

40:41.230 --> 40:43.107
-that they should smile.
-Okay.

40:43.441 --> 40:47.611
You know, I once tried not smiling
for a day, and it was really weird.

40:48.904 --> 40:51.157
Why? You're not much of a smiler.

40:51.240 --> 40:54.869
Even so, it made me feel really odd
and it freaked people out.

40:54.952 --> 40:57.413
Strangers kept asking, "Are you okay?"

40:57.496 --> 41:00.791
-Did you want to smile?
-No. Not once I realized what I was doing.

41:01.333 --> 41:04.712
Goffman says we wear these masks
to make everyone else comfortable.

41:05.838 --> 41:06.881
Like you and your suits.

41:06.964 --> 41:08.632
We're not talking about my clothes again.

41:08.716 --> 41:11.594
Your suit is your uniform you wear
to fit in at Quantico.

41:11.677 --> 41:14.763
-I don't want to fit in.
-Everyone is trying to fit in.

41:14.847 --> 41:16.807
Guess that explains
your hippie thing, too.

41:16.891 --> 41:18.851
My "hippie" thing?

41:18.934 --> 41:21.562
Your peasant tops, long hair,
bracelets, leather sandals.

41:21.645 --> 41:24.231
-Helps you assimilate on campus.
-Right.

41:24.315 --> 41:25.733
It's exactly the same.

41:25.816 --> 41:27.651
What would you wear
if no one were looking?

41:27.735 --> 41:30.112
Probably nothing. What about you?

41:31.572 --> 41:34.241
-I'd wear my suit.
-[laughs] So sad.

41:36.619 --> 41:39.580
I wonder if that's why everyone's
so confused about Roger.

41:41.332 --> 41:45.503
He's taking an activity normally reserved
for family members at home

41:45.586 --> 41:48.255
and applying it to the wrong environment.

41:48.339 --> 41:49.924
I think that's different.

41:50.007 --> 41:52.092
Look, I can't do this right now.

41:52.176 --> 41:54.678
I have to finish
because it's my semester project.

41:54.762 --> 41:57.806
We're doing this thing tomorrow night.
Come, if you're interested.

41:57.890 --> 41:59.975
Blacking out a room
in the Sociology building

42:00.059 --> 42:03.354
so people can interact without actually
being able to see each other.

42:03.437 --> 42:05.356
My partner's making up
a questionnaire for them

42:05.439 --> 42:07.858
to describe who they think they've met.

42:08.609 --> 42:09.610
Your partner?

42:10.653 --> 42:12.404
Yeah. Patrick.

42:14.406 --> 42:15.574
I see.

42:16.367 --> 42:17.409
Were you assigned?

42:17.493 --> 42:19.787
Well, we're both working
on this Goffman book.

42:19.870 --> 42:21.622
Oh, so you just have mutual interests.

42:22.122 --> 42:23.207
I guess so.

42:23.290 --> 42:24.500
Certainly seems like it.

42:26.168 --> 42:28.879
Is this you not smiling
as part of your experiment or...

42:28.963 --> 42:31.757
No, this is just me not smiling.

42:33.133 --> 42:34.134
Okay.

42:37.137 --> 42:38.931
[door opens]

42:42.184 --> 42:43.227
Good morning.

42:44.144 --> 42:45.145
Morning.

42:46.730 --> 42:47.898
Shepard wants to see you.

42:49.275 --> 42:50.484
About what?

42:50.568 --> 42:51.902
Your little field trip.

42:55.447 --> 42:56.365
How does he know?

43:15.009 --> 43:17.511
Ah. Agent Ford.

43:25.019 --> 43:28.063
The superintendent asked me
to take a look at the situation.

43:28.147 --> 43:31.233
And you said, "Oh, yeah, this is exactly
what we do here at the FBI."

43:31.317 --> 43:33.819
I just thought with the correlations
to the Brudos case--

43:33.902 --> 43:35.904
-Are you obsessed with feet?
-No, sir.

43:35.988 --> 43:38.866
Because that is the only connection
I can see. It is a thin one.

43:38.949 --> 43:41.201
There were parents and teachers
who were concerned.

43:41.285 --> 43:42.661
I know the whole damn story.

43:43.120 --> 43:44.955
We bumped into each other
in the cafeteria.

43:45.039 --> 43:48.292
This is not about how I know, it is about
what the hell were you thinking?

43:48.375 --> 43:51.378
Sir, I thought I would see if the things
we're discovering in the interviews

43:51.462 --> 43:53.255
could apply to real-life situations.

43:53.339 --> 43:56.842
The Bureau does not do that. We do not
get involved until a crime is committed

43:56.925 --> 43:58.677
and has risen to the level of our radar.

43:58.761 --> 44:03.182
With all due respect, we've helped local
law enforcement solve two murder cases.

44:03.265 --> 44:05.684
-In an advisory capacity--
-[Holden] We interviewed suspects.

44:05.768 --> 44:07.686
On cases where there were actual crimes.

44:07.770 --> 44:09.688
I spent a single day on Roger Wade.

44:09.772 --> 44:12.566
I was worried about children.
I had to follow my intuition.

44:12.650 --> 44:14.318
-Your what?
-Mm...

44:16.737 --> 44:19.114
My intuition started this.
I wanted to interview Kemper.

44:19.198 --> 44:21.617
Without me,
there would be no study, no funding.

44:21.700 --> 44:25.079
So now you know everything, is that it?
Now you're Superman, with X-ray vision?

44:25.162 --> 44:27.414
No, but I should be allowed a day to--

44:27.498 --> 44:30.250
Predict if someone might commit a crime?

44:31.460 --> 44:33.253
Who are you, the fucking thought police?

44:35.839 --> 44:37.216
Thank you both.

44:37.299 --> 44:38.967
Agent Smith, in your new BSU position,

44:39.051 --> 44:41.595
the last thing you should be following
is Agent Ford's intuition.

44:57.986 --> 45:00.447
Surprise, surprise, he had my ass.

45:00.531 --> 45:02.241
-You handed it to him.
-Thanks, Bill.

45:02.324 --> 45:05.077
-Don't know what you were thinking.
-Apparently, no one does.

45:05.160 --> 45:07.621
We'd like you to ask
before you do something like that again.

45:08.539 --> 45:10.916
-What?
-Your behavior reflects on us.

45:10.999 --> 45:14.503
You cannot use the study as justification
to launch personal campaigns.

45:14.586 --> 45:16.964
-Is that what you think I'm doing?
-I really don't know.

45:17.047 --> 45:20.134
I can't imagine why you would go after
a respected school principal

45:20.217 --> 45:21.677
with no history of abuse.

45:21.760 --> 45:24.638
Because you weren't there.
Even Gregg saw something wasn't right.

45:24.721 --> 45:26.515
It's an incorrect application
of the concepts

45:26.598 --> 45:27.808
that I'm trying to teach you.

45:27.891 --> 45:30.811
-This has nothing to do with concepts.
-She's right, Holden.

45:31.687 --> 45:34.606
What if some guy
were tickling Brian's feet?

45:34.690 --> 45:38.318
-Don't bring my kid into this.
-Not just some guy, but a guy in power,

45:38.402 --> 45:40.821
the head of the school
where he will be for years.

45:40.904 --> 45:43.282
He not only tickles,
but gives money for putting up with it.

45:43.365 --> 45:45.409
Do not use my family as an example.

45:45.492 --> 45:48.620
You ask him to stop, he won't.
You go to the police, they blow it off.

45:48.704 --> 45:51.582
So it looks like Brian is going
to get paid to get his feet tickled,

45:51.665 --> 45:54.001
and who knows what else,
and there's nothing you can do.

45:54.084 --> 45:56.712
I'd tell him to take his fucking hands
off my kid,

45:56.795 --> 45:59.840
just like I'm telling you
to stop using him as an excuse

45:59.923 --> 46:01.467
for your unprofessional behavior.

46:58.690 --> 47:02.152
[indistinct chatter
on tape recorders playing]

47:04.238 --> 47:08.075
[man]  I heard you could make yourself
start lucid dreaming, so I got this book.

47:11.203 --> 47:14.206
[indistinct chatter
on tape recorders continues]

47:15.249 --> 47:16.250
[man] Door!

47:25.759 --> 47:28.679
[low, indistinct chatter]

47:31.515 --> 47:35.060
-[man] ...sort of self-conscious.
-[woman] I'm just not sure the answer's...

48:18.520 --> 48:19.521
[man] Come on, guys.

48:22.691 --> 48:24.401
[man 2] Can you close the door, please?

48:25.527 --> 48:26.862
[man 3] Seriously, man?

49:43.438 --> 49:45.816
[phone rings]

49:51.697 --> 49:53.281
Behavioral Science.

49:53.365 --> 49:56.326
-Holden, this is Dan Cobb with the VEA.
-Yes, Dan.

49:56.410 --> 49:59.996
I'm sorry to bother you this early,
but the school board will be meeting today

50:00.080 --> 50:02.416
to make their decision
regarding Roger Wade.

50:02.499 --> 50:03.583
What kind of decision?

50:03.667 --> 50:06.795
Well, we're thinking about letting him go.

50:06.878 --> 50:07.754
I see.

50:07.838 --> 50:10.757
We'd like to know if this would be in line
with your recommendation.

50:11.425 --> 50:13.385
I really can't make a recommendation.

50:13.468 --> 50:14.886
Yeah, I get that.

50:14.970 --> 50:17.097
To be honest, we've been going in circles.

50:17.723 --> 50:20.517
What troubles me is
I believe he's developed a compulsion

50:20.600 --> 50:22.561
that he's justifying as a choice.

50:22.644 --> 50:26.398
Do you believe it's possible
he can do something... inappropriate?

50:26.481 --> 50:27.482
Well...

50:29.234 --> 50:32.696
I can't say that his behavior wouldn't
escalate to something more serious.

50:32.779 --> 50:34.698
Right. I see.

50:34.781 --> 50:37.784
Well, it sounds like we should be
erring on the side of caution.

50:40.495 --> 50:41.538
I understand.

50:41.621 --> 50:43.415
Okay. Listen, thanks for your time.
