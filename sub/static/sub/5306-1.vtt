01:07.734 --> 01:11.067
Thebes, City of the Living,

01:11.154 --> 01:13.861
crown jewel of Pharaoh Seti the First.

01:16.994 --> 01:21.033
Home of Imhotep, Pharaoh's high priest,

01:21.498 --> 01:23.238
keeper of the dead.

01:25.335 --> 01:28.702
Birthplace of Anck-Su-Namun,
Pharaoh's mistress.

01:28.797 --> 01:31.413
No other man was allowed to touch her...

01:54.531 --> 01:58.524
But for their love,
they were willing to risk life itself.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.384
What are you doing here?

02:39.576 --> 02:42.113
Who has touched you?!

02:49.127 --> 02:50.207
Imhotep?!

02:50.962 --> 02:52.293
My Priest!

03:09.648 --> 03:10.854
Pharaoh's bodyguards.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.900
- You must go! Save yourself!
- No!

03:15.987 --> 03:18.945
Only you can resurrect me!

03:21.952 --> 03:24.659
I won't leave you! Get away from me!

03:26.790 --> 03:29.532
You shall live again!

03:29.668 --> 03:31.624
I will resurrect you!

03:35.382 --> 03:38.499
My body is no longer his temple!

03:47.811 --> 03:49.722
To resurrect Anck-Su-Namun,

03:49.813 --> 03:53.931
Imhotep and his priests broke into her crypt
and stole her body.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.441
They raced deep into the desert,

03:56.528 --> 03:59.315
taking Anck-Su-Namun's corpse
to Hamunaptra, City of the Dead,

03:59.406 --> 04:00.646
HAMUNAPTRA - 1290 B.C.

04:00.741 --> 04:03.699
ancient burial site for the sons of pharaohs

04:03.869 --> 04:06.827
and resting place for the wealth of Egypt.

04:09.833 --> 04:14.793
For his love, Imhotep dared the gods' anger
by going deep into the city,

04:15.213 --> 04:19.172
where he took the black Book of the Dead
from its holy resting place.

04:20.677 --> 04:24.340
Anck-Su-Namun's soul had been sent
to the dark underworld,

04:24.681 --> 04:29.675
her vital organs removed and placed in
five sacred Canopic jars.

04:59.174 --> 05:02.086
Anck-Su-Namun's soul had come back
from the dead,

05:03.386 --> 05:06.674
but Pharaoh's bodyguards
had followed lmhotep and stopped him

05:06.765 --> 05:09.222
before the ritual could be completed.

05:22.614 --> 05:26.072
Imhotep's priests were condemned
to be mummified alive.

05:37.504 --> 05:41.793
As for. Imhotep,
he was condemned to endure the Hom-Dai,

05:42.175 --> 05:44.507
the worst of all ancient curses.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.920
One so horrible,
it had never before been bestowed.

06:27.888 --> 06:31.051
He was to remain sealed
inside his sarcophagus,

06:31.349 --> 06:33.681
be undead for all of eternity.

06:34.269 --> 06:37.227
The Magi would never allow him
to be released,

06:37.314 --> 06:41.353
for he would arise a walking disease,
a plague upon mankind,

06:41.526 --> 06:44.768
an unholy flesh-eater
with the strength of ages,

06:44.988 --> 06:49.197
power over the sands,
and the glory of invincibility.

07:16.770 --> 07:21.230
HAMUNAPTRA - 1923

07:21.858 --> 07:25.942
For 3,000 years,
men and armies fought over this land,

07:26.071 --> 07:28.528
never knowing what evil lay beneath it.

07:45.423 --> 07:48.506
And for 3,000 years, we, the Magi,

07:48.593 --> 07:52.336
the descendants of
Pharaoh's sacred bodyguards, kept watch.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.397
You just got promoted.

08:15.578 --> 08:17.068
Steady!

08:17.288 --> 08:21.406
- You're with me on this one, right?
- Your strength gives me strength.

08:23.086 --> 08:24.417
Steady!

08:28.174 --> 08:30.756
Wait! Wait for me!

08:31.803 --> 08:33.339
Steady!

08:38.434 --> 08:39.924
Fire!

10:05.313 --> 10:07.224
Run, Beni! Run!

10:07.357 --> 10:10.190
Get inside! Get inside!

10:11.945 --> 10:14.607
Hey! Don't you close that door!

10:14.697 --> 10:16.733
Don't you close that door!

11:16.551 --> 11:20.419
You will die. You will die.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.293
The Creature remains undiscovered.

11:54.297 --> 11:57.084
And what of this one?

12:13.149 --> 12:14.935
- Should we kill him?
- No.

12:15.235 --> 12:18.602
The desert will kill him.

12:20.156 --> 12:23.614
CAIRO, EGYPT - 3 YEARS LATER

12:35.088 --> 12:36.999
Sacred stones,

12:37.715 --> 12:40.172
sculpture and aesthetics,

12:41.386 --> 12:46.176
Socrates, Seth, volume one, volume two,

12:46.516 --> 12:48.552
and volume three.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.675
And...

12:51.396 --> 12:54.888
Tuthmosis. What are you doing here?

12:55.692 --> 12:57.432
T. T, t, t...

12:57.694 --> 12:59.059
T.

13:00.363 --> 13:03.025
I'm going to put you where you belong!

13:20.341 --> 13:21.456
Help.

13:49.871 --> 13:50.986
Oops.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.196
What... How...

13:59.464 --> 14:01.500
Oh, look at this!

14:02.175 --> 14:04.257
Sons of the pharaohs!

14:04.552 --> 14:08.386
Give me frogs! Flies! Locusts!

14:08.598 --> 14:10.429
Anything but you!

14:11.267 --> 14:14.009
Compared to you,
the other plagues were a joy!

14:14.103 --> 14:16.810
I am so very sorry. It was an accident.

14:16.898 --> 14:21.187
My girl, when Rameses destroyed Syria,
that was an accident.

14:21.569 --> 14:23.981
You are a catastrophe!

14:24.322 --> 14:26.108
Look at my library!

14:26.282 --> 14:28.318
Why do I put up with you?

14:29.035 --> 14:31.868
Well, you put up with me because I can...

14:31.954 --> 14:34.741
I can read and write Ancient Egyptian,

14:35.124 --> 14:38.537
and I can...
I can decipher hieroglyphics and hieratic,

14:38.628 --> 14:42.166
and, well, I am the only person
within 1,000 miles

14:42.256 --> 14:45.498
who knows how to properly code
and catalog this library, that's why.

14:45.593 --> 14:49.211
I put up with you because your father
and mother were our finest patrons.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.670
That's why!

14:50.973 --> 14:52.884
Allah rest their souls.

14:54.310 --> 14:57.973
Now, I don't care how you do it,
I don't care how long it takes,

14:58.064 --> 15:00.521
straighten up this meshiver!

15:14.330 --> 15:15.536
Hello?

15:41.607 --> 15:42.847
Abdul?

15:45.069 --> 15:46.354
Mohammed?

15:49.449 --> 15:50.529
Bob?

16:11.095 --> 16:13.928
Have you no respect for the dead?

16:15.850 --> 16:20.435
Of course I do.
But sometimes I'd rather like to join them.

16:20.521 --> 16:24.981
Well, I wish you would do it before you ruin
my career the way you've ruined yours.

16:25.067 --> 16:28.400
- Now, get out.
- My dear, sweet baby sister.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.649
I'll have you know

16:30.740 --> 16:33.777
that, at this precise moment,
my career is on a high note.

16:33.868 --> 16:37.156
High note, ha! Jonathan, please,
I'm really not in the mood for you.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.658
I've just made a bit of a mess in the library,

16:39.749 --> 16:42.661
and the Bembridge scholars have
rejected my application form again.

16:42.752 --> 16:45.869
They say I don't have enough experience
in the field.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.092
You'll always have me, old mum.

16:56.432 --> 16:59.094
Besides, I have just the thing
to cheer you up.

16:59.185 --> 17:02.598
Oh, no, Jonathan,
not another worthless trinket.

17:02.688 --> 17:05.680
If I have to take one more piece of junk
to the curator to try and

17:05.775 --> 17:07.310
sell for you.

17:11.155 --> 17:13.111
Where did you get this?

17:13.699 --> 17:16.315
On a dig down in Thebes.

17:16.827 --> 17:18.532
My whole life,
I've never found anything, Evy.

17:18.621 --> 17:21.203
Please tell me I've found something.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.743
- Jonathan.
- Yes?

17:28.756 --> 17:30.838
I think you've found something.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.381
You see the cartouche there?

17:36.472 --> 17:39.964
It's the official royal seal of Seti the First,
I'm sure of it.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.050
- Perhaps.
- Two questions.

17:42.144 --> 17:44.886
Who the hell was Seti the First,
and was he rich?

17:44.981 --> 17:47.313
He was the second pharaoh
of the 19th dynasty,

17:47.400 --> 17:49.140
said to be the wealthiest pharaoh
of them all.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.725
Good. I Iike this fellow.

17:50.820 --> 17:53.232
- I like him very much.
- I've already dated the map.

17:53.322 --> 17:54.858
It's almost 3,000 years old.

17:54.949 --> 17:59.318
And if you Iook at the hieratic just here,
well, it's Hamunaptra.

17:59.662 --> 18:01.903
Dear God, don't be ridiculous.

18:02.331 --> 18:04.697
We're scholars, not treasure hunters.

18:04.834 --> 18:07.951
Hamunaptra's a myth
told by ancient Arab storytellers

18:08.045 --> 18:09.626
to amuse Greek and Roman tourists.

18:09.714 --> 18:14.083
I know all the blather about the city
being protected by the curse of a mummy,

18:14.176 --> 18:18.920
but my research has led me to believe
that the city itself may have actually existed.

18:19.015 --> 18:23.054
- Are we talking about the Hamunaptra?
- Yes. The City of the Dead.

18:23.227 --> 18:26.390
Where the earliest pharaohs were said
to have hidden the wealth of Egypt?

18:26.480 --> 18:29.688
Yes, yes, in a big, underground
treasure chamber.

18:29.859 --> 18:32.692
- Heh!
- Oh, come on. Everybody knows the story.

18:32.778 --> 18:35.520
The entire necropolis was rigged to sink
into the sand on Pharaoh's command?

18:35.615 --> 18:38.607
A flick of a switch, and the whole place
would disappear beneath the sand dunes,

18:38.701 --> 18:39.941
taking the treasure with it?

18:40.036 --> 18:42.948
As the Americans would say,
it's all fairy tales and hokum.

18:43.039 --> 18:45.451
Oh, my goodness! Look at that!

18:52.673 --> 18:55.585
You'be burnt it!
You've burned off the part with the lost city?

18:55.760 --> 18:57.921
It's for the best, I'm sure.

18:58.220 --> 19:02.259
Many men have wasted their Iives
in the foolish pursuit of Hamunaptra.

19:02.350 --> 19:04.432
No one's ever found it.

19:04.560 --> 19:07.097
Most have never returned.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.062
Come, come! Step over the threshold.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.811
Welcome to Cairo Prison, my humble home.

19:12.902 --> 19:15.735
You told me that you got it
on a dig down in Thebes.

19:15.821 --> 19:17.482
- Yeah, well, I was mistaken.
- You lied to me.

19:17.573 --> 19:19.814
I lie to everybody.
What makes you so special?

19:19.909 --> 19:21.991
- I am your sister.
- That just makes you more gullible.

19:22.078 --> 19:23.943
You stole it from a drunk
at the local casbah?

19:24.038 --> 19:26.529
Picked his pocket, actually,
so I don't think it's a very good...

19:26.624 --> 19:29.741
Stop being so ridiculous.
What exactly is this man in prison for?

19:29.835 --> 19:31.575
This I did not know.

19:31.671 --> 19:34.458
But when I heard that you were coming,
I asked him that myself.

19:35.049 --> 19:36.164
And what did he say?

19:36.258 --> 19:39.716
He said he was just looking for a good time.

19:45.434 --> 19:48.016
- This is the man that you stole it from?
- Yes, exactly?

19:48.104 --> 19:50.186
So why don't we just go sniff
out a spot of tiffin...

19:50.272 --> 19:51.728
Who are you?

19:53.234 --> 19:54.895
- And who's the broad?
- "Broad"?

19:54.985 --> 19:59.194
I'm just a local sort of missionary chap,
spreading the good word,

19:59.281 --> 20:02.148
- but this is my sister, Evy.
- How do you do?

20:02.785 --> 20:06.494
- Oh, well. Guess she's not a total loss.
- I beg your pardon?

20:07.248 --> 20:08.363
I'll be back in a moment?

20:08.457 --> 20:11.790
- Ask him about the box.
- We have found...

20:12.128 --> 20:13.709
Hello. Excuse me?

20:13.796 --> 20:16.412
We both found your puzzle box,

20:16.882 --> 20:18.918
and we've come to ask you about it?

20:19.885 --> 20:22.046
- No.
- No?

20:22.138 --> 20:26.006
No. You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.

20:27.101 --> 20:29.433
How do you know
the box pertains to Hamunaptra?

20:29.520 --> 20:32.978
Because that's where I was when I found it.
I was there.

20:33.691 --> 20:36.649
But how do we know
that's not a load of pig's wallow?

20:37.153 --> 20:38.734
- Do I know you?
- No, no.

20:38.821 --> 20:41.187
I've just got one of those faces.

20:46.454 --> 20:49.161
You were actually at Hamunaptra?

20:50.833 --> 20:52.573
- Yeah, I was there.
- You swear?

20:52.668 --> 20:54.408
- Every damn day.
- I didn't mean that...

20:54.503 --> 20:58.872
I know. I was there. Seti's place.
City of the Dead.

20:59.675 --> 21:02.212
Could you tell me how to get there?

21:05.347 --> 21:07.804
I mean, the exact location?

21:08.100 --> 21:10.591
- You want to know?
- Well, yes?

21:10.686 --> 21:13.143
- Do you really want to know?
- Yes?

21:17.067 --> 21:19.479
Then get me the hell out of here!

21:22.740 --> 21:24.196
Do it, lady!

21:28.329 --> 21:31.162
- Where are they taking him?
- To be hanged?

21:31.415 --> 21:34.282
Apparently, he had a very good time?

21:39.799 --> 21:42.290
I will give you £100 to save this man's life.

21:42.384 --> 21:45.797
Madame, I would pay £100
just to see him hang.

21:45.888 --> 21:47.799
- £200.
- Proceed!

21:47.932 --> 21:49.047
£300.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.971
Any last requests, pig?

21:53.229 --> 21:55.766
Yeah? Loosen the knot and let me go.

21:59.735 --> 22:01.145
Of course we don't let him go!

22:03.906 --> 22:05.191
£500!

22:07.409 --> 22:10.321
And what else? I'm a very lonely man.

22:15.543 --> 22:16.623
No!

22:23.968 --> 22:25.924
His neck did not break.

22:27.721 --> 22:31.680
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Now, we must watch him strangle to death.

22:40.734 --> 22:43.146
He knows the location to Hamunaptra.

22:43.988 --> 22:46.149
- You lie.
- I would never!

22:46.282 --> 22:49.445
Are you telling me
this filthy, godless son of a pig

22:49.535 --> 22:51.651
- knows where to find the City of the Dead?
- Yes!

22:51.745 --> 22:52.860
- Truly?
- Yes!

22:52.955 --> 22:55.287
And if you cut him down, we will give you...

22:58.669 --> 23:00.330
- 10 %
- 50 %

23:00.421 --> 23:02.036
- Twenty.
- Forty.

23:02.131 --> 23:04.122
- Thirty!
- Twenty five.

23:04.508 --> 23:05.623
Deal.

23:07.761 --> 23:09.251
Cut him down!

23:20.399 --> 23:23.232
GIZA PORT - CAIRO

23:24.653 --> 23:26.439
Do you really think
he's going to show up?

23:26.530 --> 23:28.987
Yes, undoubtedly,
knowing my luck.

23:29.658 --> 23:32.400
He may be a cowboy, but I know the breed.
His word is his word.

23:32.494 --> 23:37.158
Well, personally I think he's filthy, rude,
a complete scoundrel.

23:37.249 --> 23:39.740
- I don't like him one bit.
- Anyone I know?

23:42.004 --> 23:43.084
Oh.

23:45.674 --> 23:46.789
Hello.

23:46.884 --> 23:49.591
Smashing day for the start of an adventure,
eh, O'Connell?

23:49.678 --> 23:51.669
Yeah. Yeah, smashing.

23:52.139 --> 23:55.597
Oh, no, no, I'd never steal
from a partner, partner.

23:56.810 --> 23:59.301
That reminds me?
No hard feelings about the...

23:59.396 --> 24:02.604
- Oh, no, no. Happens all the time.
- Mr. O'Connell?

24:02.691 --> 24:04.431
Can you look me in the eye
and guarantee me

24:04.526 --> 24:07.359
this isn't some sort of a flimflam?

24:07.446 --> 24:10.813
- Because if it is, I am warning you...
- You're warning me?

24:11.075 --> 24:12.656
Lady, let me put it this way,

24:12.743 --> 24:15.200
my whole damn garrison
believed in this so much

24:15.287 --> 24:18.074
that without orders, they marched
halfway across Libya and into Egypt

24:18.165 --> 24:19.154
to find that city

24:19.249 --> 24:23.083
When we got there,
all we found was sand and blood

24:24.296 --> 24:26.127
Let me get your bags.

24:31.053 --> 24:33.089
Yes, yes, you're right.

24:33.222 --> 24:36.806
Filthy, rude, a complete scoundrel.
Nothing to like there at all.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.802
Bright good morning to all.

24:40.896 --> 24:43.137
Oh, no. What are you doing here?

24:43.232 --> 24:46.850
I'm here to protect my investment,
thank you very much.

25:08.465 --> 25:11.502
Quit playing with your glasses
and cut the deck, Burns.

25:11.593 --> 25:14.505
Without my glasses
I can't see the deck to cut it, Dave.

25:14.596 --> 25:17.133
O'Connell, sit down.
We could use another player.

25:17.224 --> 25:20.261
- I only gamble with my life, never my money.
- Never?

25:20.477 --> 25:24.095
What if I was to bet you $500
we get to Hamunaptra before you?

25:24.189 --> 25:27.272
- You're looking for Hamunaptra?
- Damn straight we are.

25:27.359 --> 25:29.600
- And who saya we are?
- He does.

25:30.112 --> 25:32.444
Well... Well, how about it?

25:33.032 --> 25:34.442
Is it a bet?

25:36.410 --> 25:39.994
- All right, you're on.
- What makes you so confident, sir?

25:40.122 --> 25:43.330
- What makes you?
- We got us a man who's actually been there.

25:43.459 --> 25:46.075
Oh, what a coincidence,
because O'Connell...

25:46.503 --> 25:49.245
Whose play is it? Is it my play? I thought...

25:49.339 --> 25:52.752
Gentlemen, we got us a wager.
Good evening, Jonathan.

25:53.135 --> 25:54.545
Night.

26:09.860 --> 26:11.771
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

26:11.862 --> 26:14.899
The only thing that scares me,
Mr. O'Connell, are your manners.

26:15.741 --> 26:19.984
- Still angry about that kiss, huh?
- Well, if you call that a kiss.

26:25.501 --> 26:30.211
Did I miss something?
Are we... Are we going into battle?

26:30.297 --> 26:32.709
Lady, there's something out there.

26:33.008 --> 26:34.748
Something underneath that sand.

26:34.843 --> 26:38.085
Yes, well,
I'm hoping to find a certain artifact.

26:38.347 --> 26:41.339
A book, actually.
My brother thinks there's treasure.

26:41.475 --> 26:46.014
- What do you think's out there?
- In a word? Evil.

26:46.355 --> 26:49.847
The Bedouin and the Tuaregs believe
that Hamunaptra is cursed.

26:49.942 --> 26:53.184
Oh, look, I don't believe
in fairy tales and hokum, Mr. O'Connell,

26:53.278 --> 26:57.191
but I do believe one of the most
famous books in history is buried there.

26:57.282 --> 26:58.738
The Book of Amun-Ra.

26:58.867 --> 27:02.576
It contains within it all
the secret incantations of the old kingdom.

27:02.913 --> 27:05.495
It's what first interested me in Egypt
when I was a child.

27:05.582 --> 27:09.040
It's why I came here. Sort of a life's pursuit.

27:09.211 --> 27:13.375
And the fact that they say it's made out
of pure gold makes no never mind to you?

27:13.924 --> 27:15.664
- Right.
- You know your history.

27:15.759 --> 27:17.545
I know my treasure.

27:22.015 --> 27:23.505
By the way,

27:24.434 --> 27:25.970
why did you kiss me?

27:26.061 --> 27:29.394
I was about to be hanged.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

27:33.068 --> 27:36.151
What? What'd I say?

27:43.453 --> 27:46.365
Surprise! My good friend, you're alive!

27:46.456 --> 27:50.745
- I was so very, very worried.
- Well, if it ain't my little buddy, Beni.

27:51.461 --> 27:53.747
- I think I'll kill you.
- Think of my children.

27:53.839 --> 27:55.750
You don't have any children.

27:55.841 --> 27:57.832
- Someday I might.
- Shut up!

27:57.926 --> 28:00.258
So, you're the one
who's leading the Americans?

28:00.345 --> 28:02.301
I might have known.
So, what's the scam, Beni?

28:02.389 --> 28:05.802
You task them into the middle of the desert,
and then you leave them to rot?

28:05.893 --> 28:07.599
Unfortunately, no.

28:07.853 --> 28:09.844
These Americans are smart.

28:09.938 --> 28:12.930
They pay me only half now,
half when I get them back to Cairo.

28:13.025 --> 28:16.267
- So this time I must go all the way.
- Them's the breaks, huh?

28:17.362 --> 28:20.274
You never believed
in Hamunaptra, O'Connell.

28:20.824 --> 28:22.735
Why are you going back?

28:24.661 --> 28:27.448
You see that girl? She saved my neck.

28:32.336 --> 28:35.703
You always did have more balls than brains.

28:40.636 --> 28:42.718
Yeah. Goodbye, Beni.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.093
O'Connell!

29:03.533 --> 29:05.319
George Bembridge...

29:06.036 --> 29:08.448
In 1860...

29:11.917 --> 29:14.124
1865, was...

29:17.047 --> 29:18.207
Was...

29:18.298 --> 29:22.211
Oh, for heaven's sake, girl,
it wasn't that good of a kiss, anyway.

29:36.233 --> 29:38.189
Where is the map?

29:39.194 --> 29:41.685
It's... It's... There.

29:41.905 --> 29:44.692
And the key? Where is the key?

29:45.200 --> 29:47.782
The key? The key? What key?

29:47.869 --> 29:49.109
Evelyn!

30:05.012 --> 30:07.048
The map! The map! I forgot the map!

30:07.139 --> 30:10.427
Relax. I'm the map? It's all up here?

30:10.517 --> 30:12.382
Oh, that's comforting.

30:20.402 --> 30:22.063
- The key!
- Evy.

30:43.216 --> 30:44.831
Hold on to this.

31:13.622 --> 31:14.782
Can you swim?

31:14.873 --> 31:17.535
Of course I can swim,
if the occasion calls for it.

31:17.626 --> 31:19.867
Trust me. It calls for it.

31:43.652 --> 31:46.735
O'Connell! O'Connell!
What are we going to do?

31:46.822 --> 31:49.404
- Wait here! I'll go get help!
- Right!

32:11.805 --> 32:13.341
Americans.

32:28.530 --> 32:30.862
I say, bloody good show, chaps!

32:31.992 --> 32:33.607
And did I panic?

32:33.827 --> 32:35.533
I think not.

32:47.674 --> 32:50.165
Get them out of the water!
Get them out of the water!

32:50.260 --> 32:53.218
Come on, doggies!
Give them a smack, would you?

32:56.808 --> 32:58.969
This is a messed-up country.

33:01.980 --> 33:05.939
We've lost everything!
All of our tools, all the equipment!

33:06.151 --> 33:07.311
All my clothes!

33:07.402 --> 33:09.063
O'Connell!

33:10.280 --> 33:11.395
Hey!

33:11.907 --> 33:13.568
O'Connell!

33:13.658 --> 33:17.617
It Iooks to me Iike I've got all the horses!

33:18.079 --> 33:19.444
Hey, Beni!

33:19.539 --> 33:23.578
Looks to me
like you're on the wrong side of the river!

33:23.752 --> 33:25.367
Yeah?

33:42.437 --> 33:44.678
I only want four! Four!

33:44.773 --> 33:47.355
I only want four, not a whole bloody herd!

33:47.442 --> 33:50.775
O'Connell! Can you believe the cheek?

33:50.862 --> 33:52.693
Just pay the man.

33:52.781 --> 33:54.692
Oh, for heaven's sake.

33:55.534 --> 33:57.820
Can't believe the price of these fleabags?

33:57.911 --> 34:01.369
Yes, happy? Very good.

34:01.456 --> 34:03.538
You probably could've got them for free.

34:03.625 --> 34:06.412
- All we had to do was give him your sister.
- Yes.

34:07.087 --> 34:09.203
Awfully tempting, wasn't it?

34:15.929 --> 34:17.168
Awfully.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.242
Never did like camels.

34:44.331 --> 34:48.041
Filthy buggers.
They smell, they bite, they spit.

34:48.587 --> 34:51.545
- Disgusting.
- I think they're adorable.

34:53.842 --> 34:54.831
Oh, baby

36:43.952 --> 36:46.113
This one is strong.

36:54.963 --> 36:56.954
Good morning, my friend.

37:13.148 --> 37:14.228
What the hell we doing?

37:14.315 --> 37:17.182
Patience, my good barat'm. Patience.

37:17.277 --> 37:21.987
Remember our bet, O'Connell?
First one to the city, 500 cash bucks.

37:22.115 --> 37:24.572
A hundred of them bucks is yours
if you help us win that bet.

37:24.659 --> 37:26.274
Oh, my pleasure.

37:26.828 --> 37:29.991
Hey, O'Connell. Nice camel.

37:34.419 --> 37:36.034
Get ready for it.

37:36.921 --> 37:39.833
- For what?
- We're about to be shown the way.

37:53.855 --> 37:57.393
- Will you look at that?
- Can you believe it?

37:57.734 --> 37:59.099
Hamunaptra.

37:59.194 --> 38:00.684
Here we go again.

38:35.188 --> 38:36.724
So long, Beni!

38:39.859 --> 38:41.724
That serves you right.

39:07.679 --> 39:09.965
Go, Evy! Go!

39:51.139 --> 39:53.050
Do they know something we don't?

39:53.975 --> 39:57.217
They are led by a woman.
What does a woman know?

39:57.645 --> 39:59.681
That's a statue of Anubis.

39:59.981 --> 40:01.596
Its legs go deep underground.

40:01.691 --> 40:05.650
According to Bembridge scholars,
that's where we'll find a secret compartment

40:05.737 --> 40:07.898
containing the golden Book of Amun-Ra.

40:10.533 --> 40:13.570
Jonathan, you're meant to catch the sun
with that.

40:15.496 --> 40:19.159
- So, what are these old mirrors for?
- Ancient mirrors.

40:19.500 --> 40:22.458
It's an ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.

40:23.671 --> 40:25.627
Here, this for you.

40:27.842 --> 40:30.959
Go ahead. It's something
I borrowed off our American brethren.

40:31.054 --> 40:34.592
I thought you might like it,
you might need it for when you're...

40:34.682 --> 40:37.924
Yeah? What are you looking at?

40:48.363 --> 40:51.025
Hey, look for bugs. I hate bugs.

40:51.991 --> 40:54.277
Do you realize
we're standing inside a room

40:54.369 --> 40:56.610
no one has entered in over 3,000 years?

40:57.664 --> 41:00.030
What is that god-awful stench?

41:10.343 --> 41:13.426
And then there was light?

41:15.264 --> 41:17.380
Hey, that is a neat trick.

41:17.725 --> 41:20.341
- Oh, my God. It's a sah-netjer.
- What?

41:20.436 --> 41:22.848
- A preparation room.
- Preparation for what?

41:22.939 --> 41:25.055
For entering the afterlife.

41:26.567 --> 41:29.309
Mummies, my good son.
This is where they made the mummies.

41:40.415 --> 41:41.825
What the...

41:45.920 --> 41:47.456
What was that?

41:47.547 --> 41:50.380
Sounds like bugs.

41:51.384 --> 41:55.047
- He said bugs?
- What do you mean, bugs? I hate bugs!

42:12.280 --> 42:14.066
The legs of Anubis.

42:15.199 --> 42:19.067
The secret compartment should be hidden
somewhere inside here.

42:44.604 --> 42:46.765
You scared the bejesus
out of us, O'Connell.

42:46.856 --> 42:48.141
Likewise.

42:48.232 --> 42:51.395
- Hey, that's my tool kit.
- No, I don't think so.

42:51.486 --> 42:54.444
Okay? Perhaps I was mistaken.

42:55.907 --> 42:57.443
Have a nice day, gentlemen.

42:57.533 --> 42:59.489
We have a lot of work
to be getting along with.

42:59.577 --> 43:02.910
- Push off! This is our dig site?
- We got here first.

43:04.916 --> 43:07.248
This here's our statue, friend.

43:07.335 --> 43:10.077
I don't see your name written on it, pal.

43:10.379 --> 43:13.416
Yes, well, there's only four of you

43:13.758 --> 43:15.749
and 15 of me.

43:15.968 --> 43:18.300
Your odds are not so great, O'Connell.

43:19.097 --> 43:21.338
- I've had worse.
- Yeah, me, too.

43:23.101 --> 43:26.559
Oh, look, for goodness' sake,
let's be nice, children.

43:27.105 --> 43:30.689
If we're going to play together,
we must learn to share.

43:32.902 --> 43:35.188
There are other places to dig.

43:39.450 --> 43:43.238
According to these hieroglyphics,
we're underneath the statue.

43:43.329 --> 43:45.115
We should come up right between his legs.

43:45.206 --> 43:47.117
When those damn Yanks go to sleep...

43:47.208 --> 43:48.744
- No offense.
- None taken.

43:48.835 --> 43:50.245
We'll dig our way up and steal that book

43:50.336 --> 43:51.325
right out from under them?

43:51.420 --> 43:53.786
Are you sure
we can find this secret compartment?

43:53.881 --> 43:56.748
Oh, yes, if those beastly Americans
haven't beaten us to it.

43:56.843 --> 43:58.504
- No offense.
- None taken.

43:58.594 --> 44:00.710
Where'd our smelly Iittle friend get to?

44:16.154 --> 44:17.234
Hey.

44:21.951 --> 44:23.657
What have we here?

44:27.582 --> 44:28.913
Blue gold.

44:31.002 --> 44:33.914
This will fetch a mighty fine price.

44:45.766 --> 44:48.348
- Let's get us some treasure!
- Careful!

44:49.270 --> 44:51.181
Seti was no fool.

44:51.772 --> 44:54.980
I think perhaps
we should let the diggers open it.

44:55.359 --> 44:59.068
Oh, I think we should listen
to the good doctor, Henderson.

44:59.614 --> 45:01.855
Yeah, sure. Let them open it.

45:25.223 --> 45:26.554
Let me get this straight.

45:26.641 --> 45:29.053
They ripped out your guts
and stuffed them in jars?

45:29.143 --> 45:32.727
They'd take out your heart as well.
You know how they took out your brains?

45:32.813 --> 45:34.428
I don't think we need to know this.

45:34.523 --> 45:38.061
They'd take a sharp, red-hot poker,
stick it up your nose,

45:38.152 --> 45:41.736
scramble things asbout a bit,
and then rip it all out through your nostrils.

45:41.822 --> 45:44.154
- That's gotta hurt.
- It's called mummification.

45:44.242 --> 45:46.324
- You'll be dead when they do this.
- For the record,

45:46.410 --> 45:49.447
if I don't make it out of here,
don't put me down for mummification.

45:49.538 --> 45:50.823
Likewise.

46:00.007 --> 46:01.838
Oh, my God. It's a...

46:02.677 --> 46:04.463
It's a sarcophagus.

46:07.181 --> 46:09.513
Buried at the base of Anubis.

46:11.519 --> 46:14.556
He must have been
someone of great importance.

46:15.731 --> 46:18.689
Or he did something very naughty.

46:21.821 --> 46:23.186
Oh, Allah.

46:27.493 --> 46:28.778
One more.

46:31.706 --> 46:32.991
One more.

46:50.099 --> 46:52.385
Help me! Help me!

46:52.476 --> 46:53.716
Help me!

47:11.329 --> 47:12.944
Well, who is it?

47:15.124 --> 47:17.581
"He That Shall Not Be Named."

47:22.256 --> 47:24.167
This looks like some sort of a lock.

47:24.258 --> 47:26.340
Well, whoever's in here
sure wasn't getting out.

47:26.427 --> 47:28.042
Yeah, no kidding.

47:28.137 --> 47:31.129
It'd take us a month
to crack into this thing without a key.

47:31.223 --> 47:32.429
A key?

47:33.142 --> 47:36.179
A key! A key!
That's what he was talking about!

47:36.270 --> 47:38.932
- Who?
- The man on the barge,

47:39.023 --> 47:40.934
the one with the hook.
He was looking for a key.

47:41.025 --> 47:42.686
Hey, that's mine.

48:07.927 --> 48:10.839
- What do you suppose killed him?
- Did you ever see him eat?

48:10.930 --> 48:14.798
Seems that our American friends
had a little misfortune of their own today.

48:15.142 --> 48:18.680
Three of their diggers were melted.

48:18.896 --> 48:20.636
- What?
- How?

48:20.856 --> 48:22.221
Salt acid.

48:22.775 --> 48:27.314
Pressurized salt acid.
Some kind of ancient booby trap.

48:28.239 --> 48:30.696
Maybe this place really is cursed.

48:34.036 --> 48:36.402
Oh, for goodness' sake, you two!

48:36.580 --> 48:38.787
- You don't believe in curses?
- No, I don't.

48:38.874 --> 48:42.992
I believe if I can see it and I can touch it,
it's real. That's what I believe.

48:43.295 --> 48:45.377
I believe in being prepared.

48:45.464 --> 48:48.672
Let's see what our friend
the warden believed in.

48:54.849 --> 48:56.885
- What?
- My God, what is it?

48:57.810 --> 48:59.425
A broken bottle.

49:00.020 --> 49:02.306
Glenlivet, 12 years old!

49:03.107 --> 49:06.645
He may have been as stinky fellow,
but he had good taste.

49:09.530 --> 49:12.067
Take this. Stay here.

49:12.241 --> 49:15.028
- No, wait, wait! Wait for me. Wait!
- Evy!

49:15.119 --> 49:18.282
Excuse me,
but didn't the man just say stay here?

49:18.372 --> 49:19.407
Evy!

49:22.501 --> 49:25.413
Mr. Henderson! Wake up!

50:05.085 --> 50:06.416
O'Connell!

50:25.940 --> 50:26.929
Enough!

50:28.651 --> 50:31.768
We will shed no more blood,
but you must leave?

50:32.613 --> 50:34.604
Leave this place or die.

50:35.658 --> 50:37.319
You have one day.

51:01.100 --> 51:02.306
Evelyn.

51:04.645 --> 51:05.725
Hey.

51:07.606 --> 51:10.518
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

51:11.318 --> 51:12.808
- You sure?
- Thank you.

51:12.903 --> 51:16.816
That proves it. Old Seti's fortune's
got to be under this sand.

51:16.991 --> 51:19.983
For them to protect it like this,
you know there's treasure down there.

51:20.077 --> 51:23.990
No, these men are desert people.
They value water, not gold.

51:24.540 --> 51:28.624
You know, maybe just at night,
we could combine forces.

51:31.088 --> 51:33.079
Hey, tough stuff, try a right hook.

51:33.173 --> 51:35.710
Ball up your fist and put it...
Put it up like that.

51:36.010 --> 51:37.750
And then mean it. Hit it right here.

51:37.845 --> 51:40.052
- Mean it!
- Okay.

51:42.891 --> 51:45.348
Okay, it's time for another drink.

51:45.728 --> 51:48.014
Unlike my brother, sir,

51:48.856 --> 51:51.188
I know when to say no.

51:53.527 --> 51:55.768
And unlike your brother, miss,

51:55.863 --> 51:57.728
you, I just don't get.

51:59.700 --> 52:02.567
I know. You're wondering

52:03.787 --> 52:07.871
what is a place like me doing
in a girl like this.

52:08.250 --> 52:12.163
- Yeah, something like that.
- Egypt is in my blood.

52:12.713 --> 52:13.953
You see,

52:14.048 --> 52:18.633
my father was a very, very famous explorer.

52:18.969 --> 52:21.085
And he loved Egypt so much,

52:21.388 --> 52:24.721
he married my mother, who was an Egyptian

52:25.059 --> 52:27.721
and quite an adventurer herself?

52:29.229 --> 52:32.892
I get your father
and I get your mother, and...

52:34.610 --> 52:36.566
I get him, but...

52:37.613 --> 52:39.604
What are you doing here?

52:40.991 --> 52:45.234
Look, I may not be an explorer

52:45.663 --> 52:49.952
or an adventurer or a treasure seeker

52:50.042 --> 52:53.250
or a gunfighter, Mr. O'Connell,

52:53.962 --> 52:58.626
but I am proud of what I am.

52:59.426 --> 53:01.087
And what is that?

53:01.178 --> 53:02.258
I...

53:04.473 --> 53:06.429
am a librarian.

53:10.604 --> 53:13.596
And I am going to kiss you,

53:13.899 --> 53:16.265
- Mr. O'Connell.
- Call me Rick.

53:22.825 --> 53:24.110
Rick.

54:00.487 --> 54:03.229
- There is a curse upon this chest.
- Curse, my ass.

54:03.323 --> 54:06.065
- Who cares?
- Have a care, Mr. Henderson.

54:06.160 --> 54:09.243
In these hallowed grounds,
that which was set forth in ancient times

54:09.329 --> 54:11.786
- is as strong today as it was then.
- We understand.

54:11.874 --> 54:13.830
What's it say?

54:21.008 --> 54:23.590
"Death will come on swift wings"

54:23.677 --> 54:26.464
"to whomsoever opens this chest."

54:37.858 --> 54:39.769
We should not be here.

54:40.569 --> 54:42.150
This is not good.

54:42.237 --> 54:43.602
It says,

54:43.697 --> 54:45.608
"There is one, the undead,"

54:46.325 --> 54:49.692
"who, if brought back to life,
is bound by sacred law"

54:49.787 --> 54:51.743
"to consummate this curse."

54:51.830 --> 54:54.663
Let's make sure we don't bring anyone
back from the dead then.

54:54.750 --> 54:57.708
"He will kill all who open this chest"

54:58.212 --> 55:00.954
"and assimilate their organs and fluids,"

55:02.424 --> 55:04.961
"and in so doing, he will regenerate"

55:05.302 --> 55:07.509
"and no longer be the undead,"

55:08.055 --> 55:10.546
"but a plague upon this Earth."

55:12.476 --> 55:15.639
Well, we didn't come
all this way for nothing.

55:15.729 --> 55:17.970
- That's right.
- It's the curse.

55:18.273 --> 55:19.809
It's the curse.

55:19.900 --> 55:23.688
It's the curse! Beware of the curse!

55:23.779 --> 55:25.315
Beware!

55:25.405 --> 55:28.147
Stupid superstitious bastard.

55:30.452 --> 55:33.159
Oh, I've dreamt about this
since I was a little girl.

55:33.247 --> 55:34.657
You dream about dead guys?

55:34.748 --> 55:37.831
Look, the sacred spells
have been chiseled off.

55:38.210 --> 55:41.327
This man must have been condemned
not only in this life, but in the next.

55:41.421 --> 55:43.582
- Tough break.
- Yeah, I'm all tears.

55:43.674 --> 55:47.087
Now, let's see who's inside, shall we?

55:57.688 --> 56:00.350
Oh, my God,
I hate it when these things do that.

56:00.440 --> 56:01.896
Is he supposed to look like that?

56:01.984 --> 56:04.396
No, I've never seen
a mummy look like this before.

56:04.486 --> 56:07.228
He's still... Still...

56:07.322 --> 56:08.357
- Juicy.
- Juicy.

56:08.448 --> 56:09.688
Yes.

56:09.783 --> 56:12.741
He must be more than 3,000 years old,

56:12.828 --> 56:15.410
and, well, it looks as if he's still

56:15.789 --> 56:17.370
decomposing.

56:18.125 --> 56:19.786
Hey, look at that.

56:22.212 --> 56:26.251
- What do you make of this?
- My God, these marks were made with...

56:27.676 --> 56:29.132
Fingernails.

56:30.304 --> 56:32.295
This man was buried alive.

56:34.349 --> 56:36.260
And he left a message.

56:37.185 --> 56:40.643
"Death is only the beginning?"

56:59.666 --> 57:01.031
Oh, my God.

57:01.835 --> 57:03.826
It does exist.

57:03.921 --> 57:06.754
- The Book of the Dead.
- A book?

57:07.341 --> 57:09.957
Who cares about a book?
Where the hell's the treasure?

57:10.052 --> 57:11.667
This, gentlemen.

57:12.888 --> 57:15.049
This is treasure.

57:16.516 --> 57:19.349
Hell, I wouldn't trade you for a brass...

57:22.064 --> 57:24.646
Look at that.

57:25.025 --> 57:27.266
There's your treasure, gentlemen.

57:27.361 --> 57:29.352
Now, we're on to something.

57:45.337 --> 57:48.204
I believe you need a key to open that book.

57:50.342 --> 57:51.457
Say, O'Connell,

57:51.551 --> 57:53.963
what do you think
these babies'll fetch back home?

57:54.054 --> 57:58.172
We hear you boys found yourselves
a nice, gooey mummy. Congratulations.

57:58.266 --> 58:02.600
If you dry that fellow out,
you might be able to sell him for firewood.

58:02.896 --> 58:04.227
Look what I found.

58:04.314 --> 58:05.895
You're in her seat.

58:05.983 --> 58:07.189
- Now!
- Yup.

58:07.275 --> 58:10.312
Scarab skeletons, flesh-eaters.

58:10.654 --> 58:13.145
I found them inside our friend's coffin.

58:13.240 --> 58:17.279
They can stay alive for years
feasting on the flesh of a corpse.

58:17.369 --> 58:21.738
Unfortunately for our friend, he was
still alive when they started eating him.

58:21.832 --> 58:23.993
So somebody
threw these in with our guy,

58:24.084 --> 58:26.200
and then they slowly ate him alive?

58:26.294 --> 58:27.875
Very slowly.

58:27.963 --> 58:30.579
He certainly wasn't as popular fellow
when they planted him, was he?

58:30.674 --> 58:34.963
Well, he probably got a little too frisky
with the pharaoh's daughter.

58:35.137 --> 58:37.219
Well, according to my readings,

58:37.305 --> 58:42.015
our friend suffered the Hom-Dai,
the worst of all Ancient Egyptian curses,

58:42.102 --> 58:44.718
one reserved only
for the most evil of blasphemers.

58:44.813 --> 58:48.180
In my research, I've never heard of
this curse having actually been performed.

58:48.275 --> 58:50.687
- That bad, huh?
- Yes, well, they...

58:50.777 --> 58:53.610
They never used it because they feared it so.

58:53.697 --> 58:58.191
It's written that if a victim of the Hom-Dai
should ever arise,

58:58.285 --> 59:01.618
he would bring with him
the 10 plagues of Egypt.

59:32.360 --> 59:34.567
That's called stealing, you know?

59:34.654 --> 59:38.397
According to you and my brother,
it's called borrowing.

59:40.994 --> 59:43.906
I thought the Book of Amun-Ra
was made out of gold?

59:44.039 --> 59:47.952
It is made out of gold.
This isn't the Book of Amun-Ra.

59:48.043 --> 59:50.204
This is something else.

59:50.337 --> 59:53.204
I think this may be the Book of the Dead.

59:53.548 --> 59:55.254
The Book of the Dead?

59:55.342 --> 59:57.674
Are you sure you're meant to be
playing around with this thing?

59:57.761 --> 59:59.592
It's just a book.

59:59.763 --> 01:00:03.506
No harm ever came from reading a book.

01:00:09.189 --> 01:00:11.601
That happens a lot around here.

01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:15.434
So, what's it say?

01:00:15.529 --> 01:00:18.646
"Amun Ra. Amun Dei."

01:00:19.491 --> 01:00:22.198
It speaks of the night and of the day.

01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:40.133
No! You must not read from the book!

01:01:06.746 --> 01:01:08.111
Run!

01:01:10.584 --> 01:01:12.245
Go, go!

01:01:20.719 --> 01:01:22.926
What have we done?

01:01:24.014 --> 01:01:27.927
- Where the hell did they come from?
- I ain't waiting around to find out.

01:01:31.104 --> 01:01:33.641
My glasses. My glasses!

01:01:33.732 --> 01:01:35.848
Leave me! Leave me!

01:01:35.942 --> 01:01:37.432
Hey! Hey!

01:01:38.111 --> 01:01:40.693
Could you help me find my gl...

01:01:43.992 --> 01:01:46.074
Wait for me!

01:02:09.017 --> 01:02:10.553
Who's there?

01:02:12.812 --> 01:02:14.348
Who's there?

01:02:28.495 --> 01:02:30.110
Daniels?

01:02:54.187 --> 01:02:55.552
Oh, Jon!

01:03:01.903 --> 01:03:03.313
Scarabs!

01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:06.567
Run, Evy! Go, go, go! Run!

01:03:38.398 --> 01:03:39.763
- Evelyn?
- Evy?

01:03:39.858 --> 01:03:42.474
- Evelyn?
- Evy!

01:03:56.249 --> 01:03:57.989
Oh, Mr. Burns. Thank goodness.

01:03:58.084 --> 01:04:00.166
I was just starting to get scared.

01:04:00.253 --> 01:04:02.084
I've lost everyone.

01:04:03.590 --> 01:04:06.297
My eyes. My eyes...

01:04:27.947 --> 01:04:29.528
Please help me.

01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:34.363
My tongue. He took my tongue.

01:04:34.454 --> 01:04:36.035
Please don't leave me.

01:04:39.042 --> 01:04:41.033
Anck-Su-Namun.

01:04:41.461 --> 01:04:43.201
Damn it! It's a trap door.

01:04:43.296 --> 01:04:45.958
There's gotta be a switch
or something around here someplace.

01:04:47.342 --> 01:04:50.300
- Run, you sons of bitches! Run!
- Go.

01:05:03.983 --> 01:05:05.473
Go! Go!

01:05:13.159 --> 01:05:15.866
Come with me my Princess Anck-su-namum.

01:05:16.704 --> 01:05:18.990
There you are!
Will you quit playing hide-and-seek?

01:05:19.082 --> 01:05:21.038
Come on. Let's get out of here.

01:05:22.544 --> 01:05:23.954
Evy!

01:05:36.015 --> 01:05:37.596
- Move!
- Yeah, right.

01:05:37.684 --> 01:05:40.892
Did you see that?
It was walking. It was walking!

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:52.899
I told you to leave or die.

01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:54.819
You refused.

01:05:55.034 --> 01:05:56.945
Now, you may have killed us all,

01:05:57.036 --> 01:06:00.244
for you have unleashed a creasture
we have feared for more than 3,000 years.

01:06:00.331 --> 01:06:03.789
- Relax. I got him.
- No mortal weapon can kill this creature.

01:06:03.877 --> 01:06:05.868
He's not of this world.

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:16.302
- You bastard.
- What did you do to him?

01:06:16.389 --> 01:06:20.473
We saved him. Saved him
before the creature could finish his work.

01:06:20.935 --> 01:06:24.177
Leave, all of you, quickly,
before he finishes you all.

01:06:27.525 --> 01:06:30.983
I must now go on the hunt,
and try and find a way to kill him.

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:33.356
I already told you, I got him.

01:06:35.909 --> 01:06:37.319
Know this,

01:06:37.911 --> 01:06:40.493
this creature is the bringer of death.

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:45.199
He will never eat, he will never sleep,
and he will never stop.

01:07:18.409 --> 01:07:21.947
May the good Lord protect
and watch over me

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:24.529
as a shepherd watches over his flock.

01:07:38.388 --> 01:07:40.379
No. Okay.

01:07:59.993 --> 01:08:01.324
The language of the slaves...

01:08:03.329 --> 01:08:06.321
I may have use for you.

01:08:07.959 --> 01:08:10.041
And the rewards...

01:08:10.837 --> 01:08:13.499
...will be great.

01:08:15.216 --> 01:08:16.877
My prince.

01:08:19.679 --> 01:08:23.843
Where are the other sacred jars...

01:08:40.867 --> 01:08:44.359
FORT BRYDON - CAIRO

01:08:51.044 --> 01:08:53.877
I thought you said you didn't believe
in that fairy tales and hokum stuff.

01:08:54.421 --> 01:08:58.791
Having an encounter with a 3,000-year-old
walking, talking corpse

01:08:58.885 --> 01:09:00.216
does tend to convert one.

01:09:00.303 --> 01:09:03.636
Forget it. We're out the door,
down the hall, and we're gone.

01:09:03.723 --> 01:09:06.805
- Oh, no, we are not.
- Oh, yes, we are.

01:09:06.893 --> 01:09:09.635
Oh, no, we are not. We woke him up,
and we are going to stop him.

01:09:09.729 --> 01:09:11.810
We? What we? We didn't read that book.

01:09:11.898 --> 01:09:14.560
I told you not to play around with that thing.
Didn't I tell you?

01:09:14.651 --> 01:09:17.814
Yes, right then, me, me, me, me.
I, I, I woke him up and I intend to stop him.

01:09:17.904 --> 01:09:19.314
Yeah? How?

01:09:19.404 --> 01:09:22.020
You heard the man.
No mortal weapons can kill this guy.

01:09:22.116 --> 01:09:25.323
Then we are just going to have to find
some immortal ones.

01:09:25.411 --> 01:09:26.867
There goes that we again.

01:09:26.953 --> 01:09:29.319
Look, will you listen to me?
We have to do something.

01:09:29.415 --> 01:09:32.031
Once this creature has been reborn,
his curse is going to spread

01:09:32.126 --> 01:09:33.662
until the whole of the Earth is destroyed.

01:09:33.752 --> 01:09:36.745
- Yeah? Is that my problem?
- Lt is everybody's problem.

01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:39.125
Evelyn, I appreciate
you saving my Iife and all,

01:09:39.216 --> 01:09:42.505
but when I signed on, I agreed to take you
out there and to bring you back.

01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:45.928
I have done that? End of job. End of story.
Contract terminated.

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:47.220
That's all I am to you? A contract?

01:09:47.308 --> 01:09:52.176
You can either tag along with me or you can
stay here and try and save the world.

01:09:52.438 --> 01:09:54.895
- What's it gonna be?
- I'm staying.

01:09:54.982 --> 01:09:58.099
- Fine.
- Fine.

01:09:58.277 --> 01:09:59.483
Fine.

01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:09.744
I'm the last of the Royal Air Corps
still stationed out here, you know...

01:10:10.123 --> 01:10:12.830
Some bloody idiot spilt his drink.

01:10:13.126 --> 01:10:17.085
All the other laddies died in the sky
and were buried in the sand.

01:10:17.171 --> 01:10:19.662
Good chaps, every one of them, too.

01:10:19.966 --> 01:10:22.582
- Hi, Winston.
- Yeah...

01:10:22.677 --> 01:10:26.340
You know, O'Connell,
ever since the end of the great war,

01:10:26.431 --> 01:10:31.346
there hasn't been a single challenge
worthy of a man like me.

01:10:31.644 --> 01:10:34.101
Yeah? We all got
our little problems today, Winston.

01:10:34.188 --> 01:10:37.646
I just wish I could have chucked it in
with the others

01:10:37.734 --> 01:10:39.895
and gone down in flame and glory,

01:10:39.986 --> 01:10:42.398
instead of sitting around here, rotting

01:10:42.488 --> 01:10:44.069
- of boredom and booze.
- Of boredom and booze.

01:10:44.157 --> 01:10:45.647
Cheers.

01:10:48.244 --> 01:10:50.610
Oh, well, back to the airfield.

01:10:52.498 --> 01:10:55.080
- Tell me, has your sister always been...
- Oh, yes, always.

01:10:55.168 --> 01:10:58.160
We're all packed up, but the damn boat
doesn't leave till tomorrow morning.

01:10:58.254 --> 01:11:00.586
Tail set firmly between your legs, I see.

01:11:00.673 --> 01:11:04.632
You can talk. You don't have
some sacred walking corpse after you.

01:11:04.719 --> 01:11:06.960
So, how's your friend?

01:11:08.556 --> 01:11:12.424
He had his eyes and his tongue ripped out.
How would you be?

01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:17.683
I'm so pleased to meet you.

01:11:18.232 --> 01:11:21.349
Prince Imhotep does not Iike to be touched.

01:11:21.694 --> 01:11:25.232
A silly Eastern superstition, I'm afraid.

01:11:25.448 --> 01:11:26.813
Please forgive me.

01:11:31.704 --> 01:11:36.619
Mr. Burns, Prince Imhotep
thanks you for your hospitality.

01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:37.994
No.

01:11:38.503 --> 01:11:40.539
And for your eyes,

01:11:41.422 --> 01:11:44.289
- and for your tongue.
- Wha...

01:11:44.383 --> 01:11:47.716
- But I am afraid more is needed.
- Wha...

01:11:47.887 --> 01:11:50.253
The prince must finish the job

01:11:50.348 --> 01:11:52.088
and consummate the curse,

01:11:52.183 --> 01:11:54.048
- which you and your friends...
- No!

01:11:54.143 --> 01:11:57.761
- ...have brought down upon yourselves.
- No! Wait! No!

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:03.308
Good luck, boys.

01:12:07.698 --> 01:12:09.438
Sweet Jesus!

01:12:09.992 --> 01:12:11.903
Tasted just like...

01:12:12.912 --> 01:12:14.277
Blood.

01:12:14.372 --> 01:12:19.787
"And the rivers and waters of Egypt
ran red and were as blood."

01:12:21.963 --> 01:12:23.578
He's here.

01:12:28.094 --> 01:12:30.005
Oh, looks Iike it's gonna storm.

01:12:30.096 --> 01:12:33.133
- Oh, Evelyn!
- Oh, so you're still here.

01:12:33.975 --> 01:12:35.761
We've got problems.

01:12:58.291 --> 01:12:59.531
Hey!

01:13:00.293 --> 01:13:03.205
Beni, you little stinkweed. Where you been?

01:13:28.404 --> 01:13:30.486
We are in serious trouble.

01:13:48.674 --> 01:13:50.164
You saved me from the undead.

01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:51.419
I thank you.

01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:11.193
We are in very serious trouble.

01:14:13.032 --> 01:14:15.273
- He does seem to like you Evy.
- Yeah, what's that about?

01:14:15.368 --> 01:14:16.574
What's this guy want?

01:14:16.661 --> 01:14:19.744
There's only one person
that can give us any answers.

01:14:19.872 --> 01:14:22.363
- You!
- Miss Carnahan.

01:14:22.917 --> 01:14:25.659
- Gentlemen.
- What is he doing here?

01:14:25.962 --> 01:14:29.625
Do you really want to know,
or would you prefer to just shoot us?

01:14:29.715 --> 01:14:33.708
After what I just saw,
I'm willing to go on a little faith here.

01:14:33.803 --> 01:14:36.385
We are part
of an ancient secret society.

01:14:36.472 --> 01:14:40.181
For over 3,000 yeasrs,
we have guarded the City of the Dead.

01:14:40.267 --> 01:14:44.556
We are sworn at manhood to do any and all
in our part to stop the High Priest Imhotep

01:14:44.647 --> 01:14:46.137
from being reborn into this world.

01:14:46.232 --> 01:14:47.813
Because of you, we have failed.

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:50.482
You think this justifies the killing
of innocent people.

01:14:50.569 --> 01:14:52.480
To stop this creature? Let me think.

01:14:52.571 --> 01:14:53.902
- Yes!
- Yes!

01:14:55.533 --> 01:14:58.275
Question. Why doesn't he like cats?

01:14:58.369 --> 01:15:00.280
Cats are the guardians of the underworld.

01:15:00.371 --> 01:15:02.202
He will fear them
until he is fully regenerated?

01:15:02.289 --> 01:15:03.529
Then he will fear nothing.

01:15:03.624 --> 01:15:05.489
You know how he gets
his self fully regenerated?

01:15:05.584 --> 01:15:09.623
- By killing everyone who opened that chest.
- And sucking them dry!

01:15:09.755 --> 01:15:12.121
Jonathan, will you stop
playing with that.

01:15:12.216 --> 01:15:17.006
When I saw him alive at Hamunaptra,
he called me Anck-Su-Namun.

01:15:18.931 --> 01:15:22.048
And then juat now in Mr. Burns' quarters,
he tried to kiss me.

01:15:22.143 --> 01:15:25.055
It's because of his love for Anck-Su-Namun
that he was cursed.

01:15:25.146 --> 01:15:28.058
- Apparently, even after 3,000 years...
- He is still in love with her.

01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:30.686
Yes, that is very romantic,
but what has it got to do with me?

01:15:30.776 --> 01:15:33.017
Perhaps he will once again
try to raise her from the dead.

01:15:33.112 --> 01:15:34.147
Yes.

01:15:34.238 --> 01:15:37.401
And it appears he has already chosen
his human sacrifice.

01:15:40.286 --> 01:15:42.117
Bad luck, old mum.

01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:43.865
On the contrary,

01:15:43.956 --> 01:15:47.619
it may just give us the time we need
to kill the creature.

01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:50.326
We will need all the help we can get.

01:15:51.088 --> 01:15:52.999
His powers are growing.

01:15:57.803 --> 01:16:01.466
"And he stretched forth his hand
towards the heavens"

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:05.391
"and there was darkness
throughout the land of Egypt."

01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:07.885
We must stop him
from regenerating.

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:09.060
Who opened that chest?

01:16:09.148 --> 01:16:10.684
There was me
and Daniels here.

01:16:10.775 --> 01:16:13.107
- And Burns, of course.
- And that Egyptologist fellow.

01:16:13.194 --> 01:16:14.354
What about my buddy, Beni?

01:16:14.445 --> 01:16:16.686
No, he scrammed out of there
before we opened the thing.

01:16:16.781 --> 01:16:19.739
- Yeah, he was the smart one.
- Yeah, that sounds like Beni.

01:16:19.825 --> 01:16:23.192
We must find the Egyptologist
and bring him back to the safety of the fort

01:16:23.287 --> 01:16:25.448
- before the creature can get to him.
- Right.

01:16:25.539 --> 01:16:27.120
She stays here. You three, come with me.

01:16:27.208 --> 01:16:29.073
- Not me...
- No, no!

01:16:29.168 --> 01:16:33.081
Just a minute! You can't leave me behind
like some old carpetbag.

01:16:33.172 --> 01:16:36.505
Who put you in charge, O'Connell?
What do you think you are doing?

01:16:36.592 --> 01:16:38.128
Jonathan! O'Connell!

01:16:38.219 --> 01:16:41.006
- Sorry, but he's a bit tall.
- Jonathan, coward that you are...

01:16:41.097 --> 01:16:43.554
O'Connell, you are not leaving me in here!

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:46.967
Jonathan, if you don't
open this door in one minute flat...

01:16:47.061 --> 01:16:49.017
- O'Connell...
- This door doesn't open.

01:16:49.105 --> 01:16:50.595
- Let me out of here.
- She doesn't come out,

01:16:50.689 --> 01:16:52.645
- and no one goes in, right?
- Right.

01:16:52.733 --> 01:16:54.394
- Right?
- Right.

01:16:54.485 --> 01:16:56.646
O'Connell! Jonathan!

01:16:56.737 --> 01:16:57.977
Let's go, Jonathan?

01:16:58.072 --> 01:17:01.189
Oh, I thought I could just astay at the fort
and reconnoiter.

01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:02.568
- Now!
- Yeah, right.

01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:05.117
We're just gonna rescue the Egyptologist.

01:17:37.903 --> 01:17:41.566
Well, well, well. Let me guess.
Spring cleaning?

01:17:45.744 --> 01:17:47.109
Nice shot.

01:17:47.913 --> 01:17:51.076
Oh, Beni, did you fall down?
Let me help you up.

01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:57.044
You came back from the desert
with a new friend, didn't you, Beni?

01:17:57.131 --> 01:17:59.622
What friend? You are my only friend.

01:18:02.011 --> 01:18:05.845
What the hell are you doing with this creep?
What's in it for you?

01:18:05.931 --> 01:18:09.924
It is better to be the right hand of the devil
than in his path.

01:18:10.019 --> 01:18:13.261
As long as I serve him, I am immune.

01:18:16.942 --> 01:18:18.352
Immune from what?

01:18:19.862 --> 01:18:20.942
What did you say?

01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:23.863
I don't wanna tell you.
You'll just hurt me some more.

01:18:23.949 --> 01:18:26.816
What are you looking for?
And try not to lie to me.

01:18:27.203 --> 01:18:28.534
The book!

01:18:28.621 --> 01:18:31.784
The black book they found at Hamunaptra.
He wants it back.

01:18:31.874 --> 01:18:34.035
He said to me it would be
worth its weight in gold.

01:18:34.126 --> 01:18:36.788
- What does he want the book for?
- I don't know.

01:18:37.296 --> 01:18:40.709
Something about bringing
his dead girlfriend back to life.

01:18:40.799 --> 01:18:43.211
But that's all.
He just wants the book, I swear.

01:18:43.302 --> 01:18:46.715
Just the book, I swear. And your sister.

01:18:46.847 --> 01:18:48.007
But other than that...

01:19:39.024 --> 01:19:42.892
- That's two down, two to go.
- Then he'll be coming after Evy.

01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:44.606
Guards in place!

01:19:44.697 --> 01:19:46.233
Reporting all clear, sir!

01:19:46.323 --> 01:19:47.813
To hell with this?

01:19:47.908 --> 01:19:50.320
I'm going downstairs, get me a drink.
You want something?

01:19:50.411 --> 01:19:53.619
- Yeah. Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon.
- All right.

01:19:53.706 --> 01:19:55.992
- And a shot of bourbon.
- Yeah, okay, okay.

01:19:56.083 --> 01:19:58.620
- And as bourbon chasser.
- I'll get your damn bourbon!

01:19:58.711 --> 01:20:00.872
Don't worry about the door.

01:21:40.312 --> 01:21:42.303
Anck-Su-Namun.

01:21:53.242 --> 01:21:55.984
Hey, get your ugly face off of her!

01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:01.326
Look what I got.

01:22:18.183 --> 01:22:21.596
- You all right?
- Well, I'm not sure.

01:22:31.905 --> 01:22:35.898
Well, according to legend, the black book
the Americans found at Hamunaptra

01:22:35.993 --> 01:22:38.029
is supposed to bring people
back from the dead.

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:40.156
Until now, it was a notion
I was unwilling to believe.

01:22:40.247 --> 01:22:42.784
Believe it, sister.
That's what brought our buddy back to life?

01:22:42.875 --> 01:22:46.242
Yes. I'm thinking that if the black book
can bring dead people to life...

01:22:46.336 --> 01:22:49.999
- Then maybe the gold book can kill him.
- That's the myth.

01:22:50.090 --> 01:22:52.957
Now, we just have to find out
where the gold book is hidden.

01:22:53.051 --> 01:22:54.666
Imhotep.

01:22:55.053 --> 01:22:56.634
Imhotep.

01:22:56.847 --> 01:22:58.553
Imhotep.

01:22:58.891 --> 01:23:00.631
Lmhotep.

01:23:01.143 --> 01:23:02.929
Imhotep.

01:23:03.228 --> 01:23:07.312
Imhotep.

01:23:07.566 --> 01:23:13.482
Imhotep.

01:23:13.947 --> 01:23:15.733
Imhotep.

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:17.406
Imhotep.

01:23:17.493 --> 01:23:21.486
Last but not least,
my favorite plague, boils and sores.

01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:23.571
They have become his slaves.

01:23:23.957 --> 01:23:27.245
So it has begun, the beginning of the end.

01:23:27.336 --> 01:23:29.918
Not quite yet, it hasn't. Come on.

01:23:31.048 --> 01:23:32.754
Imhotep.

01:23:33.258 --> 01:23:35.089
Imhotep.

01:23:35.219 --> 01:23:36.755
Imhotep.

01:23:39.765 --> 01:23:43.303
Imhotep.

01:23:44.144 --> 01:23:45.759
Imhotep.

01:23:52.778 --> 01:23:55.611
According to Bembridge scholars,
the golden Book of Amun-Ra

01:23:55.697 --> 01:23:57.688
is located inside the statue of Anubis.

01:23:57.783 --> 01:23:59.774
- That's where we found the black book.
- Exactly.

01:23:59.868 --> 01:24:01.733
Looks Iike the old boys
at Bembridge were mistaken.

01:24:01.828 --> 01:24:03.443
They mixed the books up.

01:24:03.539 --> 01:24:05.325
Mixed up where they were buried.

01:24:05.415 --> 01:24:08.452
So, if the black book
is inside the statue of Anubis,

01:24:08.544 --> 01:24:11.206
then the golden book must be inside...

01:24:16.802 --> 01:24:19.885
- Come on, Evy, faster.
- Patience is a virtue.

01:24:21.765 --> 01:24:23.426
Not right now, it isn't.

01:24:23.517 --> 01:24:26.429
- I think I'll go and get the car started.
- I've got it.

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:30.729
The golden Book of Amun-Ra
is at Hamunaptra inside the statue of Horus.

01:24:30.941 --> 01:24:33.182
Take that, Bembridge scholars.

01:24:42.452 --> 01:24:44.613
Imhotep.

01:24:45.247 --> 01:24:47.829
Lmhotep.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:52.710
Imhotep.

01:24:53.005 --> 01:24:55.121
Imhotep.

01:25:02.014 --> 01:25:04.471
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:25:06.226 --> 01:25:08.763
Get this thing in gear, boy.
Let's get out of here.

01:25:08.854 --> 01:25:11.186
- Evy. Come on, Evy. Hurry up.
- Imhotep!

01:25:11.356 --> 01:25:12.846
Imhotep!

01:25:19.489 --> 01:25:22.356
You're gonna get yours, Beni! You hear me?

01:25:22.951 --> 01:25:27.365
- You're gonna get yours!
- Oh, like I've never heard that before!

01:25:57.736 --> 01:25:59.647
Hang on!

01:26:35.273 --> 01:26:37.980
Hey! O'Connell! O'Connell!

01:27:33.498 --> 01:27:34.658
Jump down!

01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:39.500
Move, move, move!

01:27:42.340 --> 01:27:44.046
Imhotep.

01:27:44.134 --> 01:27:45.715
Imhotep.

01:27:46.136 --> 01:27:47.672
Imhotep.

01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:53.345
Imhotep.

01:27:53.852 --> 01:27:55.638
Imhotep.

01:27:58.607 --> 01:28:00.347
It's the creature.

01:28:00.942 --> 01:28:02.773
He's fully regenerated.

01:28:08.158 --> 01:28:10.194
Come with me, my princess.

01:28:10.368 --> 01:28:13.531
It is time to make you mine forever.

01:28:13.747 --> 01:28:16.033
For all eternity, idiot.

01:28:22.172 --> 01:28:25.505
Take my hand,
and I will spare your friends.

01:28:26.718 --> 01:28:28.128
Oh, dear.

01:28:30.430 --> 01:28:33.137
- Have you got any bright ideas?
- I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

01:28:33.225 --> 01:28:36.638
You better think of something fast,
because if he turns me into a mummy,

01:28:36.728 --> 01:28:39.060
you're the first one I'm coming after.

01:28:43.068 --> 01:28:44.148
No.

01:28:44.236 --> 01:28:45.271
- Don't.
- No!

01:28:45.362 --> 01:28:47.648
He has to take me to Hamunaptra
to perform the ritual.

01:28:47.739 --> 01:28:51.357
She is right.
Live today, fight tomorrow.

01:29:02.879 --> 01:29:05.586
I'll be seeing you again.

01:29:11.721 --> 01:29:13.052
Evelyn!

01:29:15.767 --> 01:29:18.930
- Hey, that's mine.
- Thank you.

01:29:20.355 --> 01:29:21.595
Kill them all!

01:29:21.690 --> 01:29:23.897
No! Let go of me!

01:29:23.984 --> 01:29:25.565
- Lmhotep.
- Let go of me!

01:29:25.652 --> 01:29:28.610
- Goodbye, my friend.
- Come here, you little...

01:29:28.697 --> 01:29:31.564
Imhotep.

01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:33.781
Imhotep.

01:29:37.581 --> 01:29:38.696
Come on!

01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:40.701
- What about my sister?
- We're gonna get her back!

01:29:40.792 --> 01:29:42.498
Go!

01:29:42.586 --> 01:29:43.951
You're next!

01:29:45.463 --> 01:29:47.374
Come on! Give me your hand!

01:29:47.465 --> 01:29:49.626
- You go!
- Come on!

01:29:49.718 --> 01:29:50.958
Go!

01:30:23.668 --> 01:30:26.660
Morning, Winston. A word?

01:30:28.173 --> 01:30:31.916
What's your little problem got to do
with His Majesty's Royal Air Corps?

01:30:32.010 --> 01:30:33.546
Not a damn thing.

01:30:35.388 --> 01:30:37.925
- Is it dasngerous?
- You probably won't live through it.

01:30:38.016 --> 01:30:39.927
By Jove, do you really think so?

01:30:40.018 --> 01:30:42.509
Everybody else we've bumped into has died.
Why not you?

01:30:42.604 --> 01:30:45.266
What's the... What's the challenge, then?

01:30:45.357 --> 01:30:49.020
Rescue the damsel in distress,
kill the bad guy, and save the world.

01:30:50.487 --> 01:30:52.944
Winston Havlock at your service, sir.

01:31:04.209 --> 01:31:06.200
Are you all right?

01:31:07.087 --> 01:31:09.544
Do I bloody look all right?

01:31:13.593 --> 01:31:15.174
How you doing?

01:31:24.813 --> 01:31:28.431
See that? I've never seen one so big.

01:31:29.067 --> 01:31:30.978
- Never?
- No!

01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:46.907
Get off me! Get off!

01:31:48.670 --> 01:31:50.535
I need a new job.

01:32:11.443 --> 01:32:12.979
Oh, my God.

01:32:13.445 --> 01:32:14.855
We're back.

01:32:27.375 --> 01:32:28.956
O'Connell.

01:32:41.514 --> 01:32:43.800
Oh, my God.

01:32:45.435 --> 01:32:49.394
Hey, Winston! Pedal faster!

01:32:51.608 --> 01:32:53.348
Hang on, men!

01:33:36.861 --> 01:33:39.068
Stop it! You'll kill them!

01:33:39.197 --> 01:33:40.858
That's the idea.

01:33:56.089 --> 01:33:58.455
Here I come, laddies!

01:34:25.869 --> 01:34:29.236
I love the whole sand-wall trick.
It was beautiful.

01:34:29.330 --> 01:34:30.570
Bastard.

01:34:47.891 --> 01:34:49.256
Excuse me.

01:34:51.936 --> 01:34:56.646
A little help would be useful,
if it's not too much trouble!

01:34:58.151 --> 01:35:00.107
Yeah, yeah. All right.

01:35:05.658 --> 01:35:08.240
Winston! Hey, Winston!

01:35:22.759 --> 01:35:26.297
Quicksand! Get back! It's quicksand?

01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:15.596
Keep moving!

01:36:17.063 --> 01:36:21.432
Nasty little fellows such as yourself
always get their comeuppance.

01:36:22.151 --> 01:36:25.359
- Really? They do?
- Oh, yes.

01:36:26.531 --> 01:36:27.862
Always?

01:36:34.622 --> 01:36:37.204
I'd take
those bigger stones first.

01:36:37.667 --> 01:36:40.784
Take them from the top, otherwise
the whole thing will cave in on us.

01:36:40.878 --> 01:36:43.335
Come on. Put your backs into it.

01:36:44.882 --> 01:36:47.749
Yes, well, you've got the idea. Chop, chop.

01:36:56.561 --> 01:36:58.301
I say!

01:37:01.441 --> 01:37:04.558
Gents, you should come
and have a look at this.

01:37:12.368 --> 01:37:13.608
What?

01:37:14.037 --> 01:37:15.948
It's my arm! My arm!

01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:21.206
- Do something!
- Hold it!

01:37:21.294 --> 01:37:24.411
Do something! Do something!
Not that! Not that!

01:37:34.682 --> 01:37:36.218
O'Connell.

01:38:02.085 --> 01:38:04.952
Bembridge scholars never wrote about this.

01:38:09.967 --> 01:38:12.379
Get off me. Get off!

01:38:13.971 --> 01:38:15.381
Kill them...

01:38:15.473 --> 01:38:18.840
...and wake the others.

01:38:58.307 --> 01:39:00.593
Wha... Wha...

01:39:21.539 --> 01:39:23.279
- Can you see...
- Yeah.

01:39:23.374 --> 01:39:25.706
- Can you believe...
- Yeah.

01:39:25.793 --> 01:39:27.533
- Can we just...
- No.

01:39:38.389 --> 01:39:41.597
- Who the hell are these guys?
- Priests.

01:39:42.059 --> 01:39:43.549
Imhotep's priests.

01:39:43.978 --> 01:39:45.514
All right, then.

01:40:33.444 --> 01:40:34.934
There he is!

01:40:36.113 --> 01:40:38.069
Hello, Horus, old boy.

01:40:47.291 --> 01:40:49.247
Time to close the door.

01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:31.206
Anck-Su-Namun.

01:41:40.344 --> 01:41:41.800
O'Connell!

01:41:42.555 --> 01:41:44.011
Jonathan!

01:41:54.859 --> 01:41:57.771
Damn. These guys just don't quit, do they?

01:41:57.903 --> 01:41:59.439
Keep digging.

01:42:23.262 --> 01:42:24.877
The Book of Amun-Ra.

01:42:33.314 --> 01:42:36.147
Save the girl. Kill the creature.

01:42:48.454 --> 01:42:52.743
What are you waiting for?
Get out! Get out!

01:43:00.508 --> 01:43:02.419
You all right. Let's go.

01:43:52.643 --> 01:43:54.554
With your death, Anck-su-namun shall live.

01:43:54.645 --> 01:43:57.136
And I shall be invincible!

01:43:57.481 --> 01:44:01.224
The Book of Amun-Ra!
I found it, Evy! I found it!

01:44:01.318 --> 01:44:02.933
The Book of Amun-Ra.

01:44:03.028 --> 01:44:05.895
Shut up
and get me off here, Jonathan!

01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:09.824
Open the book, Jonathan.
It's the only way to kill him.

01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:12.697
You have to open the book
and find the inscription.

01:44:12.788 --> 01:44:16.576
Well, I can't open it!
It's locked or something.

01:44:18.335 --> 01:44:21.668
- We need the key, Evy!
- It's inside his robes.

01:44:28.554 --> 01:44:29.794
O'Connell!

01:45:01.670 --> 01:45:03.035
Mummies.

01:45:14.517 --> 01:45:17.384
Look out! There's one there... O'Connell!

01:45:42.962 --> 01:45:45.044
Here's an inscription.

01:46:04.108 --> 01:46:05.723
Oh, boy.

01:46:12.700 --> 01:46:16.067
Oh, yeah.
This just keeps getting better and better.

01:46:16.745 --> 01:46:18.906
- Do something, Jonathan.
- Me?

01:46:18.998 --> 01:46:21.956
- You can command them.
- You have got to be joking.

01:46:22.042 --> 01:46:25.534
Finish the inscription on the cover, idiot,
then you can control them.

01:46:25.629 --> 01:46:27.460
Oh. Right.

01:47:05.127 --> 01:47:06.992
Hurry up, Jonathan!

01:47:38.869 --> 01:47:42.532
- I can't figure out this last symbol.
- What does it look like?

01:47:56.637 --> 01:48:00.004
It's a bird. A stork!

01:48:12.903 --> 01:48:14.734
Ahmenophus.

01:48:16.448 --> 01:48:18.029
Oh, yes, I see.

01:48:50.149 --> 01:48:52.435
Destroy him!

01:48:53.902 --> 01:48:55.642
I command you to destroy him!

01:49:03.912 --> 01:49:05.743
Anck-Su-Namun!

01:49:10.252 --> 01:49:11.662
Give me that book!

01:49:16.842 --> 01:49:18.423
Anck-Su-Namun!

01:49:25.934 --> 01:49:27.765
Now you die.

01:49:45.996 --> 01:49:48.362
Evy, I've got it.

01:49:53.003 --> 01:49:54.493
Keep him busy.

01:49:58.342 --> 01:49:59.832
No problem.

01:50:12.231 --> 01:50:15.689
- Hurry, Evy! Hurry!
- You're not helping.

01:50:18.695 --> 01:50:21.027
Now it's your turn.

01:50:24.743 --> 01:50:26.279
Oh! I've got it?

01:50:56.191 --> 01:50:59.354
I thought you said
it was gonna kill him!

01:51:08.453 --> 01:51:09.909
He's mortal.

01:51:45.199 --> 01:51:48.282
Death is only the beginning.

01:52:18.440 --> 01:52:19.850
Time to go.

01:52:30.535 --> 01:52:33.368
You've lost the book!
Jonathan, I can't believe...

01:52:33.455 --> 01:52:34.945
- Hurry!
- Come on!

01:53:03.443 --> 01:53:06.230
- Couldn't we just...
- No, Jonathan!

01:53:12.536 --> 01:53:14.026
O'Connell!

01:53:16.707 --> 01:53:19.915
- O'Connell! Wait!
- Come on, come on!

01:53:20.168 --> 01:53:23.205
- Wait! Please!
- Come on, come on! Beni!

01:53:25.048 --> 01:53:26.629
Goodbye, Beni.

01:54:04.755 --> 01:54:05.915
Go away.

01:54:38.705 --> 01:54:40.491
Look out, look out!

01:55:27.462 --> 01:55:29.919
Thank you. Thank you very much?

01:55:30.006 --> 01:55:33.840
You have earned the respect and gratitude
of me and my people?

01:55:33.927 --> 01:55:36.634
Yes, well, it was nothing?

01:55:36.721 --> 01:55:39.007
May Allah smile upon you always.

01:55:41.059 --> 01:55:43.175
And yourself.

01:55:49.276 --> 01:55:52.063
- Yes, anytime.
- Stay out of trouble.

01:55:53.155 --> 01:55:55.897
He's just leaving us here?

01:56:00.245 --> 01:56:04.033
Well, I guess we go home
empty-handed again.
