00:10.928 --> 00:12.350
It's interesting.
I didn't think about this.

00:12.429 --> 00:15.148
It's like living a lie.

00:15.224 --> 00:19.855
I didn't live a lot of lies,
but I lived one big one.

00:19.937 --> 00:23.407
You know, it's different, I guess.
Maybe it's not.

00:23.482 --> 00:25.234
But yeah, it's...

00:27.945 --> 00:29.822
And what I said in
there with just how

00:29.905 --> 00:32.033
this story is
all over the place,

00:32.115 --> 00:34.834
and there are these two

00:34.910 --> 00:40.633
just complete
opposite narratives.

00:42.292 --> 00:46.013
You know, the only person

00:46.088 --> 00:48.807
that can actually
start to let people

00:48.966 --> 00:51.685
understand what
the true narrative is is me.

00:52.636 --> 00:54.058
And you should know that
better than anybody.

00:54.137 --> 01:00.941
Let's get to the real nature and
the real detail of the story.

01:01.019 --> 01:05.570
'Cause we haven't
heard it yet, is the truth.

01:09.987 --> 01:11.284
Lance, how you feeling?

01:11.405 --> 01:12.748
Good. I'm very good.

01:15.659 --> 01:17.627
Nervous. But that's good.

01:19.162 --> 01:21.881
Always nervous for these.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.793
Not a lot of room for error.

01:25.836 --> 01:28.510
So makes it interesting.

01:28.589 --> 01:31.388
Oh, yeah.
Welcome to the party.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.867
In 2009, I set out
to make a film about

01:52.988 --> 01:55.616
Lance Armstrong's comeback year.

01:55.699 --> 01:57.793
It seemed like a great ride.

01:57.868 --> 02:00.121
A retired champion
with a contentious past

02:00.245 --> 02:02.498
comes back to
cycling to show them all.

02:02.581 --> 02:05.004
Then the Lance
doping scandal erupted

02:05.125 --> 02:07.469
and I had to put the film aside.

02:07.544 --> 02:09.512
When I picked
the film back up, I faced

02:09.588 --> 02:12.592
the same question
that haunted me in 2009.

02:12.883 --> 02:14.977
Why did he come back?

02:15.052 --> 02:17.896
He'd won the Tour de
France seven times.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.645
I wondered what
I had been witness to in 2009.

02:21.350 --> 02:25.321
And what did it mean now that the
truth about Lance was known?

02:26.104 --> 02:30.484
In making my new film, all roads
seemed to lead back to the past.

02:47.918 --> 02:52.424
I viewed my battle with
cancer as an athletic competition.

02:52.631 --> 02:55.180
But in that,
you either win or you lose.

02:55.258 --> 02:57.852
When you lose,
or if you lose, you die.

02:57.928 --> 03:01.432
So I took that perspective,
which is a little dark,

03:01.515 --> 03:04.359
and I put it into everything
I've done since then.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.027
I like to win.

03:06.103 --> 03:07.543
But more than anything,
I can't stand

03:07.562 --> 03:08.563
the idea of losing,

03:08.647 --> 03:10.365
because, to me,
that equals death.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.114
Look at this. Armstrong
accelerating once again.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.754
And there's a gap
now starting to appear

03:14.820 --> 03:18.040
between Lance Armstrong
and Marco Pantani.

03:18.115 --> 03:20.083
Well, I never
thought I'd see the day when

03:20.200 --> 03:22.123
Lance Armstrong
would blow away the man

03:22.202 --> 03:24.830
we've always referred to as the
finest climber we've ever seen

03:24.913 --> 03:26.881
in the current
peloton of cycling.

03:26.957 --> 03:29.380
But there's one matter
that's stayed on Armstrong's tail,

03:29.459 --> 03:31.882
allegations he's used
banned performance enhancers.

03:31.962 --> 03:34.135
Where he's found this
strength from, I don't know.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.637
He has torn
the field apart here.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.307
The mythic nature
of his essential comeback,

03:39.386 --> 03:41.059
getting cancer and
coming back and being

03:41.138 --> 03:44.563
a great athlete,
is an astonishing story.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.439
If he's clean,
it's the greatest comeback.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.358
If he's not,
then it's the greatest fraud.

03:48.437 --> 03:50.565
I don't think any
sports team or any athlete

03:50.814 --> 03:53.033
has ever come under
this kind of scrutiny.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.569
Oh, and Beloki's gone down!

03:55.652 --> 03:57.199
Armstrong's off
the road as well.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.913
Armstrong,
complete control there.

03:58.989 --> 04:01.492
He's into the field,
but what a great bike rider.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.998
He's gone across.
This is unbelievable.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.499
I've never seen this before.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.456
Armstrong went
across the field there.

04:07.539 --> 04:10.258
He's back on the road
with four kilometers to go.

04:10.333 --> 04:14.679
Oh, this is incredible.
Armstrong is such a star.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.928
There are people
who have really been ruined

04:17.007 --> 04:20.101
because of Lance's aggressive
attempts to keep them quiet.

04:20.177 --> 04:23.021
He was an
immensely intimidating person.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.973
Thing about Armstrong,
he has the acceleration.

04:25.056 --> 04:27.275
When he wants to go into
a climb, he can do it.

04:27.350 --> 04:28.943
He has now decided,
"I want to go."

04:29.019 --> 04:32.614
You can see the yellow jersey is open...
What's happened now?

04:32.689 --> 04:33.941
What has happened there?

04:34.065 --> 04:35.362
Can he recover?

04:35.442 --> 04:36.443
He's come back.

04:36.526 --> 04:37.698
Armstrong is out
of the saddle again.

04:37.778 --> 04:40.201
He's jumping onto the
tail here of {ban Mayo.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.782
This is unbelievable.

04:41.865 --> 04:45.244
Armstrong is now one of
the world's most recognized athletes.

04:45.327 --> 04:48.251
To Americans, Lance
Armstrong is cycling's Superman.

04:48.330 --> 04:51.584
The bigger you are,
the better target you make.

04:51.666 --> 04:55.512
In any generation
of professional sportsmen,

04:55.587 --> 04:59.967
there will be guys who cheat and
there will be guys who don't cheat.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.599
This is a guy who was going
to succeed no matter what.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.768
His comeback and
storybook life have put

05:05.889 --> 05:07.937
Lance Armstrong
under a global spotlight.

05:08.016 --> 05:10.314
Armstrong has been
less successful in

05:10.435 --> 05:12.688
outracing accusations
of possible drug use.

05:12.771 --> 05:15.775
I've said it for seven years. I've
said it for longer than seven years.

05:15.857 --> 05:17.780
I have never doped.

05:21.655 --> 05:25.376
It's very hard to
conceal the truth forever.

05:26.368 --> 05:30.623
So this has been my downfall.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.010
No, thanks.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.346
There you are.
Come on in.

05:45.428 --> 05:46.429
I just walk on in?

05:46.513 --> 05:48.515
Hi. Thank you.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.066
Good to see you.
Ready?

05:50.141 --> 05:51.609
Saw you get your shoes on.

05:51.726 --> 05:53.148
We're getting my shoes on.

05:55.605 --> 05:56.857
Everybody, let's do
everything we need to do...

05:56.940 --> 05:59.034
This is where I came
back into the story.

05:59.109 --> 06:02.204
I was in Austin when Lance decided
to do an interview with Oprah

06:02.279 --> 06:04.498
to address charges
of doping in the press

06:04.614 --> 06:06.867
that had become
impossible to deny.

06:07.701 --> 06:10.921
Tonight on Nightline...
Did Lance cheat?

06:10.996 --> 06:13.249
Lance had been the subject
of a criminal investigation.

06:13.331 --> 06:16.335
He was also probed by
the US Anti-Doping Agency.

06:16.418 --> 06:18.512
Many ex-teammates
testified against Armstrong.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.557
Did you see Lance Armstrong using
performance-enhancing drugs?

06:22.799 --> 06:23.800
At times, yeah.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.386
There was EPO.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.470
There was testosterone.

06:28.555 --> 06:31.229
And I did see
a blood transfusion.

06:31.308 --> 06:32.685
Look,
at some point, people have to

06:32.809 --> 06:34.436
tell their kids that
Santa Claus isn't real.

06:34.519 --> 06:36.738
You're saying Lance
Armstrong is a liar?

06:36.813 --> 06:38.440
Yes.

06:39.149 --> 06:42.028
The anti-cancer crusader
was now portrayed as a cheater

06:42.110 --> 06:46.411
who ran a doping ring and used his
power as a celebrity to cover it up.

06:46.489 --> 06:49.584
UCI will ban Lance
Armstrong from cycling,

06:49.659 --> 06:53.835
and UCI will strip him of his
seven Tour de France titles.

06:54.164 --> 06:57.543
Lance Armstrong has
no place in cycling.

06:57.626 --> 06:59.628
We ready to go. Ready?

07:00.837 --> 07:02.180
So let's start
with the questions

07:02.255 --> 07:04.974
that people around the world have
been waiting for you to answer.

07:05.050 --> 07:09.021
For now I'd just
like a "yes" or "no."

07:09.095 --> 07:11.063
Did you ever take
banned substances

07:11.181 --> 07:13.149
to enhance your
cycling performance?

07:13.224 --> 07:14.726
Yes.

07:15.810 --> 07:19.656
Yes or no, was one of those
banned substances EPO?

07:19.731 --> 07:21.574
Yes.

07:21.650 --> 07:24.995
Did you ever blood dope
or use blood transfusions

07:25.070 --> 07:26.993
to enhance your
cycling performance?

07:27.072 --> 07:29.074
Yes.

07:29.157 --> 07:31.626
Did you ever use
any other banned substances

07:31.701 --> 07:36.081
like testosterone, cortisone
or human growth hormone?

07:36.164 --> 07:37.791
Yes.

07:37.874 --> 07:44.098
Yes or no, in all seven of
your Tour de France victories,

07:44.172 --> 07:47.642
did you ever take banned
substances or blood dope?

07:47.717 --> 07:49.719
Yes.

07:49.803 --> 07:53.979
The first few
minutes of Oprah was just riveting.

07:54.057 --> 07:58.528
To finally witness
him saying that he doped

07:58.603 --> 08:01.527
after the years and
years and years and years

08:01.606 --> 08:03.859
of just the most
amazing denials.

08:03.942 --> 08:06.320
I can emphatically
say I'm not on drugs.

08:06.403 --> 08:09.282
Neither I nor any
member of my team

08:09.364 --> 08:10.661
did or took anything illegal.

08:10.740 --> 08:13.493
We got nothing to hide. We know that.
Everybody knows that.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.749
You have never taken
any performance-enhancing drug?

08:15.829 --> 08:16.830
Correct.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.665
And to call somebody a cheater,

08:18.748 --> 08:21.922
a fraud, a loser,
to call them that,

08:22.002 --> 08:24.221
it has to be,
I repeat, has to be

08:24.295 --> 08:27.014
followed up with
extraordinary proof,

08:27.090 --> 08:29.639
and we've never seen it.

08:29.718 --> 08:32.597
It's cliche'. He looked me
in the eyes and told me he didn't dope.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.727
But when he does that,
he's got a power.

08:35.807 --> 08:37.683
It goes a long way.

08:37.767 --> 08:40.486
Any idiot with half
a brain should have

08:40.602 --> 08:43.322
been able to see
Armstrong was lying.

08:43.398 --> 08:45.526
They've been
testing you like crazy.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.251
They've been
following you, watching you.

08:47.318 --> 08:49.787
Don't the results speak for
themselves at a certain point?

08:50.613 --> 08:52.331
Hello!

08:54.242 --> 08:57.496
Lance Armstrong is a fraud.
I don't believe a word he says.

08:57.579 --> 09:02.130
I want this man to suffer.
And I say that with all sincerity.

09:05.587 --> 09:07.180
I can't believe
we all got duped.

09:07.255 --> 09:08.427
Lying jerk.

09:08.506 --> 09:09.849
The guy's a complete phony.

09:10.425 --> 09:12.098
He could've come clean.

09:12.177 --> 09:15.431
He owes it to the sport
that he destroyed.

09:15.513 --> 09:18.938
Was it a big deal to you?
Did it feel wrong?

09:19.976 --> 09:22.070
At the time? No.

09:22.145 --> 09:23.397
It did not even feel wrong?

09:23.521 --> 09:24.738
No.

09:24.814 --> 09:28.694
The prime time confession turned
out to be a bumpy ride for Lance.

09:28.777 --> 09:31.326
But it might never
have happened if he hadn't

09:31.446 --> 09:33.949
decided to take
a victory lap in 2009.

09:34.032 --> 09:36.160
And your comeback.
Do you regret now coming back?

09:36.242 --> 09:37.414
I do.

09:37.494 --> 09:39.997
We wouldn't be sitting here
if I didn't come back.

09:47.378 --> 09:50.427
The comeback.
What was he thinking?

09:50.507 --> 09:52.350
I kept wondering
about that question

09:52.467 --> 09:54.219
throughout the year
as I followed him.

09:55.637 --> 09:58.436
It's been a long time.
Will you be ready for the Tour?

09:58.515 --> 10:00.893
I'm comin'.
I'll be there July 4th.

10:03.228 --> 10:05.526
A few weeks
ago, when he first came up with

10:05.688 --> 10:07.986
the idea of a possible comeback,

10:08.066 --> 10:09.613
I was really surprised.

10:09.692 --> 10:12.992
I remember I sent him
a message back and I said,

10:13.071 --> 10:16.166
"Are you at a party?
Are you sober?"

10:16.616 --> 10:19.244
Johan Bruyneel,
Lance's team director

10:19.327 --> 10:21.295
for all seven of
Lance's Tour wins,

10:21.371 --> 10:23.214
was now running Team Astana.

10:24.040 --> 10:27.385
He reunited with Lance
to help guide his comeback.

10:29.838 --> 10:31.465
We good?
Sure.

10:31.548 --> 10:35.143
So is there a motivator
for you this time around?

10:35.218 --> 10:38.222
Is this in some way for you
to say to all the critics...

10:38.304 --> 10:41.934
It's been an interesting
reaction with the comeback.

10:42.016 --> 10:46.988
I mean, some people are curious,

10:47.063 --> 10:50.818
some people are pissed,
and some people are ecstatic.

10:50.900 --> 10:55.246
Few people in sport divide public
opinion quite like Lance Armstrong.

10:55.321 --> 10:58.370
To millions, he is
a source of inspiration.

10:58.449 --> 11:04.707
But to some, his incredible tale is
just that, incredible, hard to believe.

11:05.623 --> 11:07.876
Yet so many wanted to believe.

11:07.959 --> 11:10.178
Wherever Lance went,
he moved the needle.

11:10.253 --> 11:13.757
More fans, more money
for sponsors and promoters.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.935
Even so, the organization
that ran the Tour de France

11:17.010 --> 11:19.183
was reluctant to
invite him back.

11:19.262 --> 11:23.017
Just 10 months before the race,
the comeback was in jeopardy.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.978
The story is,
"Refused entry into

11:26.060 --> 11:28.438
"the Tour de
France for no reason."

11:28.521 --> 11:30.114
This guy is comin' back.

11:30.190 --> 11:33.410
He's never been caught,
prosecuted, busted for anything.

11:33.484 --> 11:37.034
He's coming back with the most legitimate,
credible program that there is.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.674
They won't let him
in the marquee event.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.328
I think the media
would fuckin' crush 'em.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.035
If they don't let him ride...

11:42.118 --> 11:44.246
He's gonna take so
much attention away

11:44.370 --> 11:46.418
from the Tour de
France to other events

11:46.497 --> 11:47.714
that they have to let him in.

11:47.790 --> 11:50.043
I think they may
come out of the gate and say,

11:50.126 --> 11:52.345
"Of course he can't race
in the Tour de France."

11:52.420 --> 11:54.172
Neither could Ivan Basso,
neither could Floyd Landis.

11:54.255 --> 11:55.256
They all cheated.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.341
That's not the same.

11:56.424 --> 11:58.301
They were all busted.

11:58.426 --> 12:00.303
And they think Lance is busted.
No, he's not.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.059
But they think...
He's not.

12:02.138 --> 12:03.481
They think it might be that way.

12:03.598 --> 12:04.895
L'Equipe said he cheated.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.942
He's never tested positive.
They think he has.

12:07.936 --> 12:09.404
He didn't.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.857
But L'Equipe said he did.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.817
What was the headline?

12:13.900 --> 12:15.652
Yes.

12:17.946 --> 12:20.040
"The Armstrong Lie."

12:21.032 --> 12:23.751
Long before Oprah,
"The Armstrong Lie" article

12:23.826 --> 12:28.457
offered proof that Lance's first
Tour win had not been clean.

12:28.539 --> 12:30.416
Through clever detective work,

12:30.500 --> 12:32.127
the author
discovered that many of

12:32.210 --> 12:34.713
Armstrong's urine
samples from 1999

12:34.796 --> 12:37.720
contained
a doping drug called EPO.

12:38.716 --> 12:40.468
If you consider my situation,

12:40.551 --> 12:44.556
a guy who comes back from,
arguably, a death sentence,

12:45.181 --> 12:46.979
why would I then
enter into a sport

12:47.100 --> 12:48.898
and dope myself up
and risk my life again?

12:48.977 --> 12:51.275
That's crazy.
I would never do that.

12:51.354 --> 12:53.322
No. No way.

12:53.398 --> 12:55.651
It was a bold claim,
considering how many

12:55.775 --> 12:58.028
riders around him
had been busted.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.577
And even after
Lance's seven Tour wins,

13:01.656 --> 13:05.286
pro cycling continued to
suffer from doping scandals.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.423
There are a lot of us
who wanted this to be

13:08.454 --> 13:10.377
a clean sport and a clean effort

13:10.456 --> 13:12.174
and a clean
victory and everything.

13:12.250 --> 13:15.629
But there's just too much
swirl around it constantly.

13:16.629 --> 13:19.098
Shortly after
Armstrong retired, there was

13:19.173 --> 13:21.551
this huge bust
called Operation Puerto,

13:21.634 --> 13:24.729
in which most of
his rivals got popped.

13:25.763 --> 13:27.481
If it was
the NBA All-Star game,

13:27.557 --> 13:29.317
it would have been every
player on both teams

13:29.350 --> 13:30.977
essentially busted for doping

13:31.060 --> 13:33.813
except that one
guy who just retired.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.323
Throughout Lance's Tour wins,

13:36.399 --> 13:39.869
all but one of the cyclists who
finished on the podium with Armstrong

13:39.944 --> 13:42.572
were implicated
in doping scandals.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.335
And finally,
the last thing I'll say for

13:47.452 --> 13:49.053
the people that
don't believe in cycling,

13:49.078 --> 13:52.753
the cynics and the skeptics,
I'm sorry for you.

13:52.832 --> 13:56.132
I'm sorry you can't dream big, and I'm
sorry you don't believe in miracles.

13:56.836 --> 14:00.682
After winning in 2005,
what better moment to walk away?

14:00.757 --> 14:02.805
What better moment to stay away?

14:02.925 --> 14:05.178
Why couldn't he have
just said thank you?

14:05.261 --> 14:07.639
"I had a nice career and now it's over.
Thank you."

14:07.722 --> 14:09.224
But that's not in him.

14:09.307 --> 14:11.230
And that urge to crush,
that urge

14:11.351 --> 14:13.228
to push back,
that urge to dominate,

14:13.311 --> 14:16.360
not just to be content with
winning, but that urge to dominate,

14:16.439 --> 14:18.533
is what ended up
bringing him down.

14:19.692 --> 14:22.536
Lance tried to
dominate my film, too.

14:22.612 --> 14:26.958
He had lied to me, straight to
my face, all throughout 2009.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.619
When the truth
came out, I told him

14:29.702 --> 14:32.080
he owed me
an explanation on camera.

14:32.830 --> 14:34.878
Whether he wanted to try
to make things right

14:34.957 --> 14:37.551
or whether he still wanted
to influence my story,

14:37.627 --> 14:39.721
he agreed to sit
down one more time.

14:41.255 --> 14:44.099
You vigorously
defended your reputation.

14:44.175 --> 14:47.270
Do you feel,
in retrospect, that you were

14:47.387 --> 14:50.436
protecting that too assiduously?

14:50.515 --> 14:54.395
Had the lie become too big? Did
it get out of control for you?

14:54.477 --> 14:57.572
Yeah, that's
the biggest regret of my life.

14:58.856 --> 15:02.861
Um, I'm a fighter.
I grew up a fighter.

15:02.944 --> 15:05.225
I was a fighter on the bike.
I was a fighter off the bike.

15:06.155 --> 15:10.410
And if you were in the race, I was
competitive and I was fighting.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.166
I forgot to turn that...

15:13.246 --> 15:15.965
I'd get off the bike, and whether
it's in a press conference,

15:16.040 --> 15:18.384
whether it's in a team setting,

15:18.501 --> 15:20.879
whether it's in
a personal relationship,

15:20.962 --> 15:23.090
I continued to fight.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.095
And I wanted to defend myself,

15:25.174 --> 15:30.431
and I wanted to defend the
sport, the team, my foundation.

15:30.513 --> 15:32.060
I was defending
all of these things,

15:32.140 --> 15:33.687
and I was
prepared to say anything.

15:36.686 --> 15:40.156
The gift that he has that gets
overlooked is his gift as a storyteller,

15:40.273 --> 15:43.197
his gift as a manager
of his own storyline.

15:43.860 --> 15:46.079
A guy at death's door comes back

15:46.154 --> 15:48.953
to win the toughest
event on the planet.

15:49.031 --> 15:50.874
The story brought more money,

15:50.992 --> 15:52.460
brought more attention,
brought more sponsorship,

15:52.535 --> 15:53.661
brought more inspiration.

15:53.744 --> 15:56.623
Lance became this
international cultural icon.

15:57.915 --> 16:00.043
And he had to
keep the story going.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.304
He could've ridden around the
world to raise money for cancer.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.507
There were a lot of
things he could've done,

16:05.715 --> 16:07.763
but the best story is
to go back to the Tour.

16:07.842 --> 16:10.971
By racing the bicycle
all over the world,

16:11.095 --> 16:14.190
beginning in Australia,
ending in France,

16:14.265 --> 16:17.815
it is the best way to
promote this initiative.

16:17.894 --> 16:20.238
It's the best way
to get the word out.

16:20.313 --> 16:23.943
He understood the power of
that story, and he used it.

16:27.612 --> 16:31.708
The disease, testicular
cancer, travels up a young man's body,

16:31.782 --> 16:34.786
so next stop is the abdomen.

16:34.869 --> 16:37.338
Next stop is the lungs.

16:37.413 --> 16:40.508
And the last stop is the brain.

16:40.583 --> 16:44.133
My dumb ass just
ignored symptoms,

16:44.212 --> 16:49.343
obvious, glaring, dirty
symptoms, for a long time.

16:49.425 --> 16:52.679
And it traveled all the way up.

16:52.762 --> 16:53.763
Severe headaches.

16:56.641 --> 16:58.143
Blurry vision.

16:58.226 --> 17:00.149
Coughing up of blood.

17:01.604 --> 17:04.824
Extreme pain downstairs.

17:04.982 --> 17:07.359
I read that you had a testicle
the size of an orange.

17:07.609 --> 17:09.328
That's an exaggeration.

17:09.403 --> 17:11.201
Lemon?

17:11.280 --> 17:12.781
Good-sized lemon.

17:12.949 --> 17:17.045
In 1996, Lance had
the cancerous testicle removed

17:17.118 --> 17:20.419
and flew to Indiana University
for an experimental treatment.

17:21.082 --> 17:23.210
The doctors there
thought Lance's chances

17:23.291 --> 17:25.714
of survival were less than 50%.

17:28.089 --> 17:31.093
Lance underwent brain surgery
to remove cancerous lesions,

17:31.175 --> 17:36.181
then began a special chemotherapy
program that would not scar his lungs.

17:36.264 --> 17:38.608
The immediate side
effects would be brutal,

17:38.683 --> 17:42.813
but if he survived, the treatment
would protect his career.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.523
Whatever I do in cycling, or
whatever I do in the Tour de France,

17:45.606 --> 17:48.155
or whatever I do in training, I'll
never suffer like I did then.

17:56.909 --> 18:00.664
That initial surgery to remove
that primary tumor in the testicle

18:00.746 --> 18:02.464
was a big surgery, a big cut.

18:02.540 --> 18:05.168
The cut was
probably six inches long,

18:05.251 --> 18:08.346
right up at the waist
and very physically painful.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.594
So I got on the bike and I just

18:10.673 --> 18:12.846
gently rode
around my neighborhood.

18:13.009 --> 18:15.011
That was a big day for me.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.938
And I went half a mile.

18:18.014 --> 18:20.858
And I did it in tennis shoes, and
I did it on a mountain bike.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.686
But I was on the bike.
I was pedaling the bike.

18:25.479 --> 18:30.201
All the feelings that are associated
with that, the wind in the hair,

18:32.528 --> 18:36.658
that initial sense of freedom
that a bicycle gives a child.

18:36.741 --> 18:41.963
Kids love bikes because it's the first
time in their life they're free.

18:42.038 --> 18:44.006
It's the first time when they're
not in their mom's car,

18:44.081 --> 18:46.334
they're not in Mom's living room,
they're not in Mom's backyard.

18:46.417 --> 18:47.634
They get on the bike,
they go down,

18:47.752 --> 18:48.992
they take a right, take a left.

18:49.045 --> 18:51.639
Nobody sees them.
They're completely free.

18:54.050 --> 18:55.597
♪ I'm a mean machine

grew up in Plano, Texas,

19:03.601 --> 19:06.821
raised by a young mother
who worked as a receptionist.

19:07.021 --> 19:09.069
He never met his father.

19:11.108 --> 19:15.329
He comes out of Plano,
Texas, and he comes out angry.

19:15.404 --> 19:18.283
He comes out ready to
take on the world with

19:18.407 --> 19:21.251
his mom at his side
and needing no one else.

19:21.369 --> 19:25.169
My morn, she doesn't
really have that much money, so...

19:25.247 --> 19:27.170
I could probably get
money from somebody,

19:27.249 --> 19:28.967
but I don't wanna borrow money,

19:29.085 --> 19:30.837
so there's pressure
to make the money.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.718
You can see in
the yellow helmet there

19:32.797 --> 19:35.346
the youngest professional in
the field from Plane, Texas,

19:35.424 --> 19:37.426
16-year-old Lance Armstrong.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.228
I just like
competing with the best, man.

19:39.303 --> 19:41.431
I like beating those guys.
I love beating people.

19:57.947 --> 20:00.027
He got into a fight with
one of his coaches early on,

20:00.199 --> 20:02.668
and the thing he kept saying
is, "You're not my dad."

20:02.827 --> 20:04.545
And I think that statement

20:04.620 --> 20:07.043
has been something he's been
telling everybody since then.

20:07.123 --> 20:10.218
Kids from Plano High School, "Hey,
you're not in charge of me."

20:10.292 --> 20:11.418
European cyclists,

20:11.502 --> 20:13.300
"Hey, I'm going
to take you all on,

20:13.421 --> 20:15.219
"and I'm going to
show you who's boss."

20:16.966 --> 20:18.138
Oh my, oh no, no!

20:18.217 --> 20:20.140
It's Armstrong
who's losing the temper.

20:20.928 --> 20:22.475
I was content with my career.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.775
In '93, '94, '95,
I was a young kid.

20:25.850 --> 20:28.148
One of the best
one-day racers in the world.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.444
I made plenty of money.

20:29.520 --> 20:33.195
I thought, "This is cool. I'm young.
I make some decent money here.

20:33.274 --> 20:35.026
"I'll just do
this for a few years

20:35.151 --> 20:36.949
"and then find
something else to do."

20:37.027 --> 20:41.373
Then the disease came along,
took all of that away.

20:41.449 --> 20:43.668
Just gone.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.791
And when I came back, I thought,

20:45.870 --> 20:47.872
"Nobody thinks I'm
gonna do anything.

20:47.997 --> 20:49.999
"I'm just washed-up,
damaged goods here."

20:50.082 --> 20:54.087
Which is really what
the view of the sport was.

20:54.170 --> 20:58.425
I thought, "Okay, fuck it. I'm gonna
try to win the Tour de France."

21:04.972 --> 21:07.316
He's got the
fastest time in half distance.

21:07.516 --> 21:08.859
SPORTSCASTER 2:
He really is flying, Paul,

21:08.934 --> 21:12.859
and he looks so good here, making his
big return to the Tour de France.

21:16.066 --> 21:18.364
He's been scorching it
on all the time checks.

21:18.444 --> 21:21.448
What a comeback this could be.
There's only two men behind him now.

21:21.530 --> 21:24.750
Armstrong is the leader.
That is astonishing.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.792
Beautiful.

21:34.460 --> 21:35.962
Good job, Lance.

21:36.045 --> 21:38.798
Hold on a second. There we go.
Say hi to the camera.

21:38.881 --> 21:41.054
This is Johan Bruyneel,
directeur sportif.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.635
Hi, camera.

21:42.718 --> 21:46.097
Here we are with the
rock star, George Hincapie.

21:46.180 --> 21:48.399
This is how he
prepares for a time trial.

21:48.474 --> 21:49.726
What's up, Lance?

21:49.809 --> 21:51.106
After his bout with cancer,

21:51.185 --> 21:56.658
Lance returned to the Tour in 1999,
racing for US Postal Service.

21:57.650 --> 22:01.496
Lance, Jon
Vaughters, Frankie Andreu.

22:01.570 --> 22:03.618
We were just like
The Bad News Bears.

22:03.739 --> 22:05.833
Nobody was really
expecting us to do well.

22:05.908 --> 22:07.501
They were so young.

22:07.576 --> 22:12.457
They had a lot of optimism and
this youthful carelessness.

22:12.540 --> 22:14.838
I hate the French.

22:14.917 --> 22:16.510
Screw the French.

22:16.585 --> 22:19.134
And they were
gonna go over there

22:19.213 --> 22:23.059
and just dominate the Tour and
change the way cycling is run.

22:23.133 --> 22:26.728
Postal, this tiny team
from an unlikely place.

22:26.804 --> 22:28.306
They didn't have a team bus.

22:28.389 --> 22:30.232
They were so small
they just had two campers.

22:30.307 --> 22:32.309
Like a family going on vacation.

22:32.393 --> 22:34.737
Betsy, Frankie, smile.

22:34.812 --> 22:36.029
Say cheese.

22:36.105 --> 22:40.861
The innocence of '99, it's
a fantastic moment in the story.

22:40.943 --> 22:42.195
Howdy.

22:43.362 --> 22:46.332
It really started
with this spectacular prologue

22:46.407 --> 22:48.660
that Armstrong won by
a handful of seconds.

22:48.742 --> 22:50.619
And there it is,
the maillot jaune

22:50.786 --> 22:52.709
for an American,
Lance Armstrong.

22:52.788 --> 22:54.711
He put on the yellow jersey.

22:54.790 --> 22:59.261
And he's clueless about what to say
or what to feel or who to hug.

23:00.504 --> 23:04.259
I mean, right now
I'm so surprised.

23:04.341 --> 23:09.518
But yet I'm so pleased and so
happy for the team and for...

23:09.597 --> 23:12.191
It's the moment where
Lance crossed a boundary.

23:12.266 --> 23:17.363
And this man, Lance Armstrong,
from Texas, now has destroyed the field.

23:17.438 --> 23:19.315
That full
confidence that he had before

23:19.481 --> 23:21.404
he had cancer when he
was a little punk kid,

23:21.483 --> 23:24.111
you can see that building in
him as the Tour was going on.

23:24.194 --> 23:26.242
This man is quite unbelievable.

23:26.322 --> 23:27.949
Towards the mountain stages,
when everybody was like,

23:28.032 --> 23:30.251
"Okay, this is when
he's gonna lose his jersey."

23:30.326 --> 23:32.249
That really helped
fuel him and fuel the team

23:32.328 --> 23:35.798
and pushed us to limits that we
thought we weren't capable of doing.

23:35.873 --> 23:37.841
And the boys who
have guided Lance Armstrong,

23:37.917 --> 23:40.261
they're in that yellow jersey
for two full weeks now.

23:40.336 --> 23:42.805
It was an American team
bringing an American captain

23:42.880 --> 23:45.975
to the Tour de France and finishing
potentially on the podium.

23:46.050 --> 23:47.677
That was unprecedented.

23:47.801 --> 23:50.145
And there's no doubt now
who will win the Tour de France.

23:50.220 --> 23:52.598
We hoped maybe to
get a podium or top 10.

23:52.681 --> 23:55.685
Soto win was
beyond our comprehension.

23:57.144 --> 24:00.193
The power of the
story was growing every day.

24:00.272 --> 24:03.526
But so were the suspicions
among seasoned observers

24:03.609 --> 24:06.453
that it may have been
too good to be true.

24:06.528 --> 24:10.374
In 1999,
the Tour de France organizers

24:10.532 --> 24:13.957
were desperate for what they
called a "Tour of Renewal,"

24:14.036 --> 24:17.586
where they could renew the
public's faith in their race.

24:18.540 --> 24:20.213
You've gotta go back to 1998

24:20.292 --> 24:22.294
when Lance was
just about coming back

24:22.419 --> 24:24.421
into racing after
his cancer recovery.

24:24.505 --> 24:26.724
We had this
extraordinary Tour de France

24:26.799 --> 24:29.473
where the world number one
team at the time, Festina,

24:29.551 --> 24:31.804
had their masseur
traveling to the race.

24:31.887 --> 24:34.140
And he was stopped
by French customs

24:34.264 --> 24:36.517
and they found a huge
cargo of drugs inside.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.399
The police then came
and investigated other teams,

24:39.478 --> 24:42.402
and pretty much wherever they
looked, they found drugs.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.108
So that was 1998.

24:44.191 --> 24:46.740
A year later,
Lance Armstrong comes back.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.163
He was sensational.

24:49.238 --> 24:52.037
And everybody who was at that race,
in terms of the journalists,

24:52.116 --> 24:55.871
when Lance made his big attack
in the mountains to Sestriere,

24:55.953 --> 24:59.082
I was in the press room that
day, I saw the reaction.

24:59.164 --> 25:02.543
People were laughing, incredulous.
They didn't believe this.

25:02.626 --> 25:04.970
Because here we had a guy
who'd come back from cancer,

25:05.045 --> 25:08.970
supposedly riding the race
clean, riding more effortlessly,

25:09.049 --> 25:11.393
with greater power
at a greater speed

25:11.510 --> 25:13.854
than all the Tours
that had gone before.

25:13.929 --> 25:15.931
So it just didn't make sense.

25:16.974 --> 25:19.227
We have to remember, this is
a guy who is not thought of

25:19.309 --> 25:21.903
as somebody who could potentially
win the Tour de France.

25:21.979 --> 25:24.198
He had always been
strong in short races,

25:24.273 --> 25:26.673
but never over the long haul and
he had never been a climber.

25:26.775 --> 25:30.200
Whenever you start the Tour, they
make you fill out these forms.

25:30.279 --> 25:33.123
"How many Tours have you done?
How many have you completed?"

25:33.198 --> 25:39.126
And I remember in '99, I had
to write down four and one.

25:39.204 --> 25:41.298
Thinking,
"That's not a great record."

25:42.583 --> 25:45.883
Lance Armstrong winning,
at one level, created a problem

25:45.961 --> 25:48.680
because the organizers had
actually said before the race,

25:48.756 --> 25:50.633
"We want this race to be slower

25:50.716 --> 25:52.684
"than the drug
races of previous years

25:52.843 --> 25:56.814
"to prove to the public that these
guys are now using less drugs."

25:56.889 --> 25:59.108
But it was
the fastest ever Tour.

25:59.183 --> 26:01.231
But on the other hand,
they had this winner

26:01.310 --> 26:03.483
who was the most romantic figure

26:03.645 --> 26:05.739
that sport maybe had ever known.

26:05.814 --> 26:10.160
A cancer survivor, overcoming the
disease, comes back and wins the Tour.

26:10.235 --> 26:12.203
Yeah, they liked that.

26:12.279 --> 26:15.123
With Lance Armstrong
winning the Tour de France,

26:15.199 --> 26:18.669
that opened up this
huge market in the US.

26:18.744 --> 26:23.375
Oakley and Nike and Trek
and Bristol-Myers Squibb.

26:23.457 --> 26:24.458
You name it.

26:24.541 --> 26:27.795
There was a long list of companies
that were just getting in line

26:27.878 --> 26:29.471
to sign deals
with Lance Armstrong

26:29.546 --> 26:31.344
because they knew who Lance was,

26:31.465 --> 26:33.263
as a cancer
survivor and as a person,

26:33.342 --> 26:36.767
and an advocate for the
cancer-surviving community.

26:37.888 --> 26:40.186
When he first won
in '99, that was

26:40.349 --> 26:42.602
the last time he
was just a bike racer.

26:42.684 --> 26:46.154
And after that,
he became a celebrity.

26:46.230 --> 26:50.485
That celebrity is what gave
him such immense power.

26:50.567 --> 26:53.491
This is not a story about doping.
It's a story about power.

26:53.570 --> 26:56.619
And Lance got
the power in '99 and the story

26:56.740 --> 26:59.789
became hanging onto that power.

26:59.868 --> 27:03.338
Even in 1999, Lance
came close to getting caught

27:03.413 --> 27:05.791
when steroids showed
up in a urine test.

27:05.874 --> 27:09.048
It turns out I
was using some cream

27:09.128 --> 27:11.722
for what we call a saddle sore.

27:12.297 --> 27:15.141
It was something
that we all use.

27:15.217 --> 27:18.391
Cortisone cream that
you use for a crash

27:18.512 --> 27:21.686
or for a boil or any
sort of skin infection.

27:22.933 --> 27:26.858
The traces were so small.
They were ridiculous.

27:26.937 --> 27:31.067
It was always on my heels
right away from '99.

27:33.235 --> 27:35.408
Of course, there were plenty of

27:35.571 --> 27:37.744
supporters and
cheerleaders in the press.

27:37.823 --> 27:40.104
Lance Armstrong forced once
again to defend himself there,

27:40.117 --> 27:42.415
which is becoming a depressingly
familiar sight on this Tour.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.713
But tonight, he has
some very high-level help

27:44.788 --> 27:47.416
because the UCI, the
world-governing body of cycling,

27:47.499 --> 27:49.100
have just released
this press communique.

27:49.376 --> 27:52.255
It goes against all their commitment
to medical secrecy, they say,

27:52.337 --> 27:54.715
but they want to do it
to clarify this situation

27:54.798 --> 27:56.766
and stop it getting
further out of hand.

27:56.842 --> 27:58.435
They confirm that
the rider used an

27:58.552 --> 28:00.054
ointment and they
give the brand name,

28:00.137 --> 28:04.313
and that he also offered them a
medical prescription before his test.

28:04.933 --> 28:08.278
It showed up in the
test, and Verbruggen just said,

28:08.520 --> 28:11.694
"Look, you gotta give us a reason
for this being in your system."

28:12.524 --> 28:15.368
So the guys
scoured the Internet,

28:15.485 --> 28:18.364
looking for this
particular type of cortisone,

28:18.447 --> 28:21.951
and we found one that was,
indeed, a cream.

28:23.202 --> 28:25.296
And we said it was
for saddle sores.

28:25.370 --> 28:26.587
When you say
Verbruggen came to you,

28:26.705 --> 28:27.877
do you mean he came to you like,

28:27.956 --> 28:30.254
"Give us some excuse so that we don't
have to make an issue of this"?

28:30.334 --> 28:33.838
He didn't come to me.
He went to Johan.

28:33.921 --> 28:35.889
Johan told me that he did speak

28:35.964 --> 28:38.262
to Verbruggen about
Lance's positive test.

28:38.675 --> 28:40.803
Verbruggen, the head of the UCI,

28:40.886 --> 28:43.810
denies that the conversation
ever took place.

28:44.765 --> 28:48.269
I've proven my class.
I've showed my class from day one.

28:48.435 --> 28:50.028
There's no secrets here.

28:50.103 --> 28:53.073
We have the oldest secret
in the book, hard work.

28:55.817 --> 28:58.570
The ninth day of the
Tour de France world-famous bike race

28:58.654 --> 29:00.702
brings the greatest
challenge yet,

29:00.822 --> 29:02.916
the lofty hills of
the Maritime Alps.

29:02.991 --> 29:06.621
This is the acid test
of stamina and endurance.

29:08.914 --> 29:11.793
The Tour de France has
always been a brutal event.

29:12.668 --> 29:15.922
For a few dollars from sponsors
looking for human billboards,

29:16.004 --> 29:19.304
working-class riders
are willing to suffer.

29:19.383 --> 29:21.135
An ascent in
the mountains can mean

29:21.218 --> 29:24.939
climbing steep grades
for more than 20 miles.

29:25.013 --> 29:28.187
Lifting a man and his
bicycle up the rising road

29:28.267 --> 29:30.645
demands
a furious release of energy

29:30.727 --> 29:32.855
that is higher than any
other animal on earth,

29:32.980 --> 29:35.074
except a hummingbird.

29:35.148 --> 29:38.948
That inhuman suffering carves
the body in unnatural ways

29:39.027 --> 29:41.029
and leaves riders to search
for doping methods

29:41.738 --> 29:44.366
that can dull pain
and push human limits.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.793
There's always
been a form of doping

29:46.910 --> 29:48.457
in any form of endurance sport.

29:48.537 --> 29:51.507
And in the Tour de France,
originally it was alcohol.

29:51.581 --> 29:53.379
You'd be passed
a bottle of beer up by a monk

29:53.542 --> 29:55.294
on a mountaintop
and you'd drink it.

29:56.545 --> 29:59.424
They enter a cafe,
shoving everyone aside.

29:59.756 --> 30:02.930
And take anything:
red wine, champagne, beer.

30:03.343 --> 30:05.220
Even water,
if there's nothing better.

30:05.429 --> 30:09.650
Then, of course, the clever doctors
would come on board saying to athletes,

30:09.725 --> 30:11.648
"We can prepare you
properly for the Tour.

30:11.893 --> 30:15.864
"We'll not just give you dope, but we'll
tell you the correct diet, how to train,

30:15.939 --> 30:19.660
"and then the coup de grace is
to give you the needle of EPO,

30:19.735 --> 30:21.988
"and you're gonna be
10% better than your rival."

30:22.070 --> 30:23.242
That is enormous.

30:23.322 --> 30:25.700
And that became
apparent in the 1990s,

30:25.782 --> 30:27.455
firstly, with the Italians.

30:30.454 --> 30:32.752
This ancient-walled
city in northern Italy

30:32.914 --> 30:35.212
became a center for
a group of doctors

30:35.292 --> 30:38.296
determined to find a way
to boost cycling performance.

30:39.588 --> 30:44.435
The most notorious of these was Lance
Armstrong's trainer Michele Ferrari.

30:44.509 --> 30:47.604
He was a doctor that gave a training
program, a full medical program,

30:47.679 --> 30:50.808
and would boost your career
and make you into

30:52.309 --> 30:53.606
the king of the road.

30:55.020 --> 30:56.522
He had a very bad reputation

30:56.605 --> 31:00.985
as being a doctor that could set
people up with a doping program.

31:02.069 --> 31:05.369
If you took all the rumors

31:05.447 --> 31:11.295
and the smoke and the stories
of the dark side of cycling

31:11.370 --> 31:16.251
and condensed them into one human
being, that would be Michele Ferrari.

31:18.794 --> 31:24.767
But he turns out to be a very delightful,
communicative, expressive scientist.

31:24.841 --> 31:26.593
That's the bit that
gets lost a little bit.

31:26.676 --> 31:29.771
I think he comes across as sort
of a cloak-and-dagger enabler,

31:29.846 --> 31:32.099
when in fact, his whole story,

31:32.224 --> 31:34.397
his core interest, the way
he educated himself,

31:34.476 --> 31:36.478
is essentially scientific.

31:37.479 --> 31:39.481
Michele Ferrari was
obsessed with pushing

31:39.648 --> 31:41.525
the limits of human
athletic performance.

31:42.484 --> 31:45.909
If cyclists saw themselves
as biological racing machines,

31:45.987 --> 31:49.161
Ferrari was one of the world's
greatest mechanics.

31:50.659 --> 31:55.460
This is one of the first
relationship with Lance.

31:55.539 --> 32:00.887
Probably he was already with
cancer, but nobody knew.

32:00.961 --> 32:03.555
Surprisingly,
in 2009, Lance and his team

32:03.672 --> 32:06.266
gave me permission
to talk to Ferrari,

32:06.341 --> 32:09.094
a man who rarely gave
interviews to outsiders.

32:09.719 --> 32:13.690
So in '95, you saw Lance and
you thought he has enormous potential.

32:13.765 --> 32:15.813
He was able to
develop a lot of power,

32:15.934 --> 32:18.028
absolute power, a lot of watts.

32:18.812 --> 32:20.985
His potential was impressive.

32:22.107 --> 32:27.705
His engine, you can say his
heart, lungs, is big, is huge.

32:29.489 --> 32:31.867
After Lance
survived cancer, Ferrari found

32:32.033 --> 32:34.377
a way to turn his
weakness into strength.

32:34.453 --> 32:38.003
He was definitely lighter.

32:38.081 --> 32:43.463
He lose a lot of muscles in the whole
body, upper and also in the legs.

32:43.545 --> 32:47.550
He lose a lot of power
in terms of strength.

32:47.632 --> 32:49.634
To make up for
the loss of strength,

32:49.718 --> 32:53.143
Ferrari had Lance shift to a
lower gear and pedal faster.

32:53.221 --> 32:56.851
So he essentially was
shifting the load from the muscles

32:56.933 --> 33:00.107
to the heart and
the lungs and the blood.

33:01.438 --> 33:07.070
And if you can have the aerobic
engine to sustain a higher cadence,

33:07.152 --> 33:09.280
you can go farther,
faster, longer.

33:10.113 --> 33:12.912
Ferrari also
included a secret ingredient,

33:12.991 --> 33:15.585
drugs to boost oxygen
in the blood that had

33:15.744 --> 33:18.338
a special impact
with the new cadence.

33:18.413 --> 33:20.666
This unbelievable
cadence that he's adopted

33:20.790 --> 33:23.043
since he survived
testicular cancer

33:23.126 --> 33:24.594
is what has
allowed him to become

33:24.753 --> 33:26.255
one of the best
climbers in the world.

33:27.172 --> 33:29.516
Utilizing a higher cadence...

33:29.591 --> 33:32.219
At the beginning,
we had to do this choice.

33:32.469 --> 33:37.566
And then, because this choice paid
in term of results, we continued.

33:39.643 --> 33:42.487
Ferrari's remarkably unromantic.

33:42.562 --> 33:44.610
I remember one
particular conversation.

33:44.731 --> 33:46.733
We had just
finished a training ride.

33:46.816 --> 33:51.162
And I said, "Am I watching the
limits of human potential here?

33:51.238 --> 33:52.364
"Is that what I'm seeing?"

33:52.447 --> 33:54.370
And Ferrari almost laughed.

33:54.449 --> 33:57.123
He said, "We're
nowhere near the limit.

33:57.244 --> 33:59.793
"No, there are ways
to push the limits."

34:01.790 --> 34:04.259
Amongst the 200 guys doing
the Tour de France at that point,

34:04.334 --> 34:08.179
they're like, "You're working
with Ferrari. Okay. Respect."

34:08.255 --> 34:10.007
He knew that
everybody was doping.

34:10.090 --> 34:14.094
He was like, "Look, you can't
do this stuff on your own.

34:14.177 --> 34:17.681
"You guys aren't doctors. You have
no idea what all this stuff is.

34:17.764 --> 34:19.311
"So here's what I'm gonna do.

34:19.391 --> 34:23.146
"You can still dope a little bit.
I'll tell you what to do.

34:24.312 --> 34:27.110
"The minimum amount of doping,
the maximum amount of training.

34:27.190 --> 34:29.112
"Nutrition. Lifestyle.

34:29.192 --> 34:30.694
"Everything that
goes into making you

34:30.777 --> 34:32.620
"a good cyclist,
I will help you with."

34:33.071 --> 34:35.119
And doping was just
a small piece of that.

34:36.366 --> 34:39.085
Ferrari was careful
about doping for another reason.

34:39.159 --> 34:41.413
He wanted to avoid detection.

34:41.496 --> 34:44.090
He had sources
inside anti-doping labs

34:44.206 --> 34:46.801
who kept him updated
on the latest tests.

34:46.876 --> 34:50.597
And Ferrari's whole program
was cloaked in secrecy.

34:53.757 --> 34:56.681
In March 1999, Lance said,

34:56.761 --> 34:59.731
"I gotta go see Michele.
I have to do some testing."

34:59.806 --> 35:03.276
We met Michele Ferrari,
Lance's doctor,

35:04.519 --> 35:07.113
who traveled in a camper van,

35:07.188 --> 35:10.567
in the parking lot
outside of Milano

35:10.692 --> 35:14.071
off the highway by
a hotel gas station.

35:15.238 --> 35:19.414
I don't know about you, but I
don't see my doctor that way.

35:19.618 --> 35:21.837
It's best that you use
the most knowledgeable people,

35:21.911 --> 35:26.087
regardless of their reputation.

35:26.166 --> 35:28.635
It's a great mind in cycling

35:28.710 --> 35:31.133
and somebody that I consider
and my team considers

35:31.212 --> 35:34.466
to be an honest
man and a fair man.

35:37.594 --> 35:39.642
The guy was a liar and a cheat.

35:39.721 --> 35:42.349
Not only did he dope,
but he doped

35:42.474 --> 35:45.068
with the best
expertise available.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.066
Dr. Ferrari provides that.

35:47.145 --> 35:50.490
And he doped in the most
professional, efficient way,

35:50.565 --> 35:53.068
perhaps in the history of sport.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.370
What kind of message
do you think that your

35:55.487 --> 35:57.660
working relationship
with Michele Ferrari

35:57.739 --> 36:00.538
sends out to
the general sporting public?

36:02.410 --> 36:04.412
Well, David, I'm glad
you showed up, finally.

36:04.579 --> 36:06.581
It's good to see
you finally here.

36:10.043 --> 36:11.841
Good question.

36:11.920 --> 36:15.265
Again, I think that
people are not stupid.

36:15.340 --> 36:17.092
People will look at the facts.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.348
They will say, "Okay,
here's Lance Armstrong.

36:19.427 --> 36:21.725
"Here's the relationship.

36:21.805 --> 36:23.557
"Is that questionable?"

36:23.640 --> 36:26.484
Perhaps. But people are smart.

36:26.559 --> 36:30.780
Do they say, "Has Lance Armstrong
ever tested positive?" No.

36:30.855 --> 36:33.483
"Has Lance Armstrong
been tested?" A lot.

36:33.692 --> 36:36.696
Is it fairly easy to
prepare for a test?

36:36.778 --> 36:39.748
Does it dissipate
in your system really quickly?

36:39.823 --> 36:42.827
The half-life of
EPO is four hours.

36:44.911 --> 36:47.130
So, you can back
it out from there

36:47.205 --> 36:49.799
and figure out when
you're in trouble.

36:50.333 --> 36:54.429
"Will he pass every test
because he does not take EPO?"

36:54.504 --> 36:56.006
Yes, he will.

36:56.089 --> 36:58.842
My defense was that I've
passed every control you've given me.

36:58.925 --> 36:59.972
And that's true.

37:00.051 --> 37:02.554
The samples that
were given were clean.

37:02.637 --> 37:04.139
But you never,
ever stopped there.

37:04.305 --> 37:05.773
You always went
one step further.

37:05.849 --> 37:09.479
No, Alex. I can't...
I would have gone...

37:10.562 --> 37:12.985
if David Walsh wanted
to put on boxing gloves,

37:13.064 --> 37:14.816
I would have done it
right there. Let's go.

37:14.899 --> 37:18.904
You present yourself as
the cleanest of clean riders...

37:18.987 --> 37:23.208
And I have the proof,
which you refuse to believe.

37:23.283 --> 37:24.910
Just let me finish the question.

37:24.993 --> 37:27.542
You present yourself as the
cleanest of clean riders,

37:27.620 --> 37:30.339
and yet you
associate with somebody

37:30.457 --> 37:33.176
whose reputation is
incredibly tarnished.

37:33.251 --> 37:36.596
And that person is going to go
on trial in two months' time.

37:36.671 --> 37:39.675
Would you not think that it would
be in the interest of cycling

37:39.758 --> 37:42.557
for you to suspend your
relationship with Michele Ferrari

37:42.635 --> 37:47.482
until he has answered the
charges of which he's accused?

37:47.557 --> 37:49.605
You have a point.
It's my choice.

37:49.684 --> 37:51.982
I view him as innocent. He's
a clean man, in my opinion.

37:52.061 --> 37:53.779
Let there be a trial.

37:54.564 --> 37:56.111
There was a trial.

37:56.191 --> 38:00.071
The star witness was an Italian
cyclist, Filippo Simeoni.

38:01.863 --> 38:05.117
He told me very clearly
that to prepare for a big race

38:05.200 --> 38:06.998
I needed to take
certain substances.

38:07.076 --> 38:08.168
In particular, EPO.

38:08.828 --> 38:11.297
I had some journals confiscated

38:11.414 --> 38:17.512
where I meticulously documented
my interactions with Ferrari

38:18.463 --> 38:20.966
In October 2004,
the Italian court

38:21.090 --> 38:23.593
convicted Dr. Ferrari
of sporting fraud,

38:23.676 --> 38:27.476
forcing Armstrong to publicly
end their relationship.

38:27.555 --> 38:31.856
However, Ferrari's conviction would
be overturned two years later.

38:31.935 --> 38:34.188
At the end, I was absolved.

38:35.396 --> 38:40.323
Probably, we need a movie to explain
the whole story with Simeoni.

38:44.280 --> 38:49.081
But in
relationship with EPO, okay.

38:51.371 --> 38:56.969
Generational riders utilize
that drug in competition.

38:57.043 --> 39:01.423
That's historic true.

39:02.215 --> 39:06.641
EPO, or synthetic EPO stimulates
the production of red blood cells

39:06.719 --> 39:09.142
which transmit
oxygen to the muscles.

39:09.222 --> 39:11.224
Originally
developed to treat anemia,

39:11.307 --> 39:13.605
cyclists began
using it in the 1990s

39:13.768 --> 39:16.021
to boost
performance and recovery.

39:16.104 --> 39:17.276
It doesn't make
your muscles stronger,

39:17.438 --> 39:18.564
it doesn't give you more energy.

39:18.648 --> 39:19.820
There's nothing you feel.

39:19.899 --> 39:23.699
It's just simply
that it allows your body

39:23.778 --> 39:27.499
to deliver more oxygen from
your lungs to your muscles.

39:27.574 --> 39:31.624
So, that burning sensation, that fatigue
where you can't go any further,

39:31.703 --> 39:33.751
it just happens later.

39:35.456 --> 39:38.130
It began in the late
'80s and into the early '90s,

39:38.209 --> 39:41.383
and our frustration
really came to a head in 1995.

39:41.462 --> 39:46.559
But leading up to that, specifically
1994, I was the world champion.

39:46.634 --> 39:49.057
I was wearing the world champion's
jersey, the rainbow-striped jersey,

39:49.137 --> 39:50.559
and competing clean.

39:50.638 --> 39:53.232
We were just
getting annihilated.

39:53.308 --> 39:55.902
Go on, Lance.
Give us the tour.

39:57.812 --> 39:59.064
Holy COW.

39:59.147 --> 40:01.696
There was a group of
us primarily living in Italy,

40:01.774 --> 40:05.654
and we just said, "We either have
to play ball here or go home."

40:06.613 --> 40:08.286
Were you pissed off
that you had to do it?

40:08.364 --> 40:10.662
Or was it just you
had to do what you had to do

40:10.825 --> 40:13.123
in order to be able to compete?

40:13.202 --> 40:14.624
The latter.

40:18.541 --> 40:22.512
Maybe I'd approach the
decision differently today,

40:22.587 --> 40:24.931
but at the time,
I didn't lose sleep over it.

40:26.966 --> 40:30.971
One time, I went into
Lance's room to borrow his laptop,

40:31.054 --> 40:33.307
and he's brushing his teeth
in his boxer shorts,

40:33.389 --> 40:37.360
and he decides to give himself a
shot of EPO right in front of me.

40:37.435 --> 40:39.779
That was an attempt
by him of just saying,

40:39.896 --> 40:42.240
"Listen, buddy,
you've stepped over the line.

40:42.315 --> 40:44.443
"You're in the club.
There's no going back."

40:44.525 --> 40:46.527
Where is everybody?

40:48.029 --> 40:50.157
His perspective
was, "Listen, this doping's

40:50.239 --> 40:52.458
"been in place for 100
years in this sport.

40:52.575 --> 40:55.749
"And I came into the system, and
the system was already in place,

40:55.828 --> 40:58.923
"and I just have to
'play by the rules."'

40:58.998 --> 41:00.545
You weren't trying
to beat the system.

41:00.667 --> 41:02.067
You were trying to
be in the system.

41:02.377 --> 41:04.175
Nobody made me dope.

41:04.253 --> 41:07.883
I just knew that I had to dope to
do the sport that I love to do.

41:07.966 --> 41:10.310
I was a good bike
racer, and then all of a sudden,

41:10.385 --> 41:13.309
guys who can only sprint were getting
over big climbs in front of me

41:13.388 --> 41:16.232
and doing things that they
never could do before.

41:16.307 --> 41:19.151
And I was getting dropped
and struggling, and so...

41:20.895 --> 41:23.694
I lived with that for a while,
but after a while, I cracked.

41:23.773 --> 41:25.946
And so I ended up
taking EPO also.

41:26.025 --> 41:31.031
And admitting to it doesn't make
it justifiable or any better.

41:31.114 --> 41:33.617
But it was something that was
pretty prevalent at the time.

41:33.700 --> 41:39.207
Now, in '99, when you were on
Lance's team, was there a team program?

41:41.958 --> 41:44.461
I'm not gonna go into all that.

41:46.879 --> 41:50.975
VAUGHTERS. Going into '99, there
were massive risks regarding doping.

41:51.050 --> 41:53.303
I was really scared.

41:53.386 --> 41:56.014
You could go to jail
for having this stuff.

41:56.097 --> 41:59.021
The big fear was basically
getting caught holding.

41:59.100 --> 42:02.855
The Festina affair was not an
entire team testing positive.

42:02.937 --> 42:04.905
The Festina affair
was a soigneur crossing

42:04.981 --> 42:06.983
a border and
a customs agent going,

42:07.150 --> 42:09.152
"Hang on a second."

42:11.279 --> 42:14.203
1999 was the year
they cracked the code.

42:14.282 --> 42:16.876
It was the year they figured
out how to win the race.

42:16.951 --> 42:20.797
They hit on a plan, and it was
really Lance who hit on a plan.

42:20.872 --> 42:22.920
They would hire a guy.

42:22.999 --> 42:25.468
He was Lance's gardener.
He was also a mechanic.

42:28.212 --> 42:31.512
They called him Motoman.
He had a fast red motorcycle.

42:31.591 --> 42:33.719
He was fearless.

42:33.801 --> 42:36.224
Motoman basically did the Tour
de France on a motorcycle,

42:36.304 --> 42:39.148
and he would meet up
with a staff member

42:39.223 --> 42:42.022
and just do a subtle handoff
at some restaurant.

42:42.101 --> 42:45.480
And then, next thing you know,
I was back at the hotel

42:45.646 --> 42:49.071
and the doctor
would administer it.

42:49.150 --> 42:51.744
A lot of people
who watch our programs

42:51.819 --> 42:54.368
have heard of your illness
and see you winning now

42:54.447 --> 42:56.745
and think it's
nothing short of a miracle.

42:56.824 --> 42:58.576
Do you see it that way?

42:59.660 --> 43:00.661
Um...

43:01.996 --> 43:03.339
It is a miracle.

43:03.831 --> 43:07.586
At that time, he had recently
taken delivery of EPO from Motoman.

43:07.668 --> 43:10.467
He was involved in
all manner of doping.

43:10.546 --> 43:14.221
If they were doing this
drug, why didn't they get caught?

43:14.300 --> 43:16.348
Well, there was no
test for EPO at the time.

43:16.469 --> 43:18.597
Those early years,
people, they always say to me,

43:18.679 --> 43:20.522
"Why didn't they do more?
Why didn't they do more?"

43:20.598 --> 43:24.694
They could not do any more.
You couldn't find it.

43:26.187 --> 43:28.815
In 2000, they
developed a test for EPO.

43:28.898 --> 43:31.492
So the smart guys,
Ferrari being one of them,

43:31.609 --> 43:34.158
went back to
an older technology,

43:34.237 --> 43:38.834
which was you take out bags
of blood before the race.

43:38.908 --> 43:41.787
During the race,
you put them back in.

43:41.869 --> 43:44.918
During the race,
the body, in need of oxygen,

43:44.997 --> 43:46.874
is thirsty for red blood cells.

43:46.958 --> 43:49.802
A transfusion boosts the
number of red blood cells.

43:49.877 --> 43:54.178
And unlike EPO, transfusions are
almost impossible to detect.

43:54.257 --> 43:55.600
They're still against the rules,

43:55.675 --> 43:59.896
but hard to stop unless inspectors
can find the blood bags.

44:00.888 --> 44:03.391
My initial reaction to this
was how gross it was.

44:03.975 --> 44:09.027
That you want to
win this race so bad

44:09.230 --> 44:12.234
that you would take
your blood in a bag,

44:14.569 --> 44:17.948
put it in a cooler with ice
and beer and other stuff,

44:18.030 --> 44:20.249
and then
eventually put it back in?

44:22.660 --> 44:24.913
On the other hand,
it's like, "Look,

44:25.079 --> 44:27.332
"if this is what they
thought it took to win,

44:27.415 --> 44:30.715
"and that they also thought that
everybody else was doing it..."

44:30.793 --> 44:32.340
Is that an argument you buy?

44:32.420 --> 44:33.512
No, I don't buy it.

44:33.588 --> 44:37.013
But I think that when you're
talking about this stuff,

44:37.091 --> 44:40.937
there is definitely a moral
relativism to the whole thing.

44:41.012 --> 44:43.561
2000. It was a time
when they were

44:43.639 --> 44:45.733
trying to implement the test.

44:45.808 --> 44:49.938
They didn't know exactly what was
positive, what was negative.

44:50.021 --> 44:51.443
The science wasn't ready yet.

44:51.522 --> 44:54.867
My suspicion is that
everybody used it at the Tour.

44:54.942 --> 44:57.866
Michele came to me and said,

44:57.945 --> 45:00.039
"You shouldn't
use EPO at the Tour.

45:00.114 --> 45:04.494
"I don't feel good about that. I think
they're close to getting the test right."

45:04.577 --> 45:06.454
He knew when
the test was gonna be ready.

45:06.621 --> 45:08.840
He said,
"it's not worth the risk.

45:08.956 --> 45:11.209
"Let's just do
one transfusion."

45:11.292 --> 45:12.714
We all agreed, and so we did one

45:12.793 --> 45:14.795
transfusion in
the middle of the Tour.

45:15.504 --> 45:18.474
But a lot of
the Tour was won before...

45:18.549 --> 45:23.555
The Tour was won on Hautacam in
2000 when I won by four minutes.

45:23.638 --> 45:25.640
That was pre-transfusion.

45:30.436 --> 45:32.939
But he made that call.

45:34.148 --> 45:36.116
And we all questioned that call.

45:36.192 --> 45:37.910
Because you thought
it wasn't gonna be enough.

45:37.985 --> 45:39.828
I thought that was
not gonna be enough.

45:43.449 --> 45:46.248
Each year, the bar got
nudged a little higher.

45:46.327 --> 45:48.421
The innovation demands grew.

45:48.496 --> 45:52.091
You had to keep up with the
Joneses or fall behind.

45:52.166 --> 45:54.589
It became this
game of hide-and-seek.

45:54.669 --> 45:57.263
And the best place to hide
sometimes is plain sight.

45:57.338 --> 45:59.306
And that's what they
chose to do in 2004.

46:00.341 --> 46:02.218
They faked
a mechanical breakdown,

46:02.343 --> 46:04.266
pulled the bus over
to the side of the road

46:04.345 --> 46:07.098
and administered blood bags
to the entire team.

46:07.181 --> 46:10.401
In front of everybody. In front of
the police, in front of the fans.

46:11.936 --> 46:14.405
It struck me as odd,
but it made sense.

46:14.480 --> 46:16.482
We were gonna do it eventually.

46:16.565 --> 46:20.615
So might as well knock it out on
the bus before we got to the hotel

46:20.695 --> 46:22.197
and be done with it.

46:23.823 --> 46:26.918
When everyone cheats,
then it becomes hugely distorted.

46:26.993 --> 46:28.666
It becomes a different contest,

46:28.786 --> 46:30.413
a contest of who's
got the best doctor,

46:30.496 --> 46:34.967
who's got the most money, who's
got the biggest risk tolerance.

46:35.042 --> 46:38.467
And the guy who was that guy
for this era was Lance.

46:39.213 --> 46:41.181
That's where it
becomes a game of power.

46:41.257 --> 46:44.682
When you can say, "I'm signing up
Ferrari to be my exclusive doctor."

46:44.760 --> 46:47.559
When you can say,
"I'm gonna use a private jet

46:47.680 --> 46:50.399
"to travel around
to evade detection."

46:53.394 --> 46:56.022
Life, for me,
at the time, was moving fast.

46:56.814 --> 46:58.487
Look at 2005.

46:58.566 --> 47:00.819
I had won seven Tours in a row.

47:00.901 --> 47:03.324
I was engaged to
a beautiful rock star.

47:04.613 --> 47:06.991
But that all just
felt normal to me.

47:08.868 --> 47:12.668
I certainly was very confident
that I would never be caught.

47:17.418 --> 47:20.092
Armstrong rather enjoyed this.
I think he embraced it.

47:20.171 --> 47:21.889
I think he had the attitude,
"If you're gonna cheat,

47:21.964 --> 47:23.090
"you don't cheat halfway.

47:23.174 --> 47:25.051
"You cheat all the way.
You bring everything."

47:26.552 --> 47:28.680
If it's training, it's 100%.

47:28.763 --> 47:30.686
If it's equipment, it's 100%.

47:30.765 --> 47:32.642
If it's doping, it's 100%.

47:32.725 --> 47:36.525
So once he crossed that tine, and
once he'd overcome his moral dilemma,

47:36.604 --> 47:38.527
it was two feet in for him.

47:38.606 --> 47:39.949
Don't bring
a knife to a gunfight.

47:40.024 --> 47:43.369
I think he thought that the
Tour de France was a gunfight,

47:43.444 --> 47:46.243
and why show up with a knife
if everyone else has guns?

47:46.322 --> 47:48.916
When you take that killer
mentality and put it in a sport

47:48.991 --> 47:52.040
where there are no regulations,
where there are no rules

47:52.119 --> 47:55.544
and people are transfusing bags of
blood and taking all kinds of drugs

47:55.623 --> 47:58.217
and using their power
to avoid being detected,

47:58.292 --> 48:00.340
that's where it
stops being sport

48:00.461 --> 48:02.555
and starts being
something much darker.

48:11.972 --> 48:14.100
Why did you come back in 2009?

48:14.183 --> 48:15.776
Did you think this
was an opportunity

48:15.851 --> 48:19.822
to actually convince people
that you had never doped?

48:19.897 --> 48:21.149
I don't think so.

48:21.232 --> 48:23.109
I don't think you're ever
gonna shut their mouths.

48:23.192 --> 48:27.789
But I did intend to go back
and win and do it clean.

48:27.863 --> 48:30.582
Did you have any
concern about going back

48:30.658 --> 48:32.376
and opening up
some of the questions

48:32.493 --> 48:34.211
that had been
raised in the past?

48:34.286 --> 48:35.788
Of course.

48:39.667 --> 48:43.342
So Lance knew the risk
he was taking in coming back.

48:44.380 --> 48:46.929
With new doping
controls in place in 2009,

48:47.007 --> 48:50.728
maybe he thought he had a
chance to ride clean and win.

48:50.803 --> 48:52.931
I thought that his
comeback might have been a way

48:53.013 --> 48:55.766
of proving to his
critics and to himself

48:56.559 --> 48:59.312
that it didn't matter
if he had doped in the past.

49:01.188 --> 49:03.111
I know what I did and didn't do,

49:03.232 --> 49:05.155
so therefore, I sleep at night.

49:05.526 --> 49:06.527
Um...

49:07.736 --> 49:10.285
And I'm one of the greatest
riders of all time.

49:10.364 --> 49:12.787
If you look at the books
and you look at the records,

49:12.867 --> 49:17.338
you won seven Tours in a period where
everybody thought everybody was dirty.

49:17.413 --> 49:20.883
If I win again,
they can't say that.

49:20.958 --> 49:23.302
They cannot.

49:23.377 --> 49:25.050
Well, you can, but...

49:25.129 --> 49:28.724
There'd be a few dickheads that
say that, trust me, but...

49:28.799 --> 49:30.221
No way.

49:32.428 --> 49:35.272
Lance,
you've spoken recently about

49:35.347 --> 49:41.275
the return of Ivan Basso and Floyd
Landis after their suspensions

49:41.353 --> 49:43.321
and that they
should be welcomed back.

49:43.397 --> 49:47.152
What is it about these dopers
that you seem to admire so much?

49:47.234 --> 49:49.953
So I'm driving to
the press conference.

49:50.029 --> 49:52.999
And George Hincapie texts me.

49:53.073 --> 49:57.419
And he says, "Kimmage is here. He's
asking all kinds of crazy questions."

49:57.495 --> 50:01.170
I knew the name, but I didn't
really know what he looked like.

50:01.248 --> 50:03.717
I knew he was Irish, obviously.

50:03.792 --> 50:07.171
And so I said, "Okay.
It's on. Today's the day.

50:07.254 --> 50:09.973
"He's gonna ask something. He's
gonna say something stupid."

50:10.049 --> 50:12.097
Excuse me.
What is your name again?

50:12.176 --> 50:14.679
My name is Paul Kimmage.
I work for Sunday Times.

50:14.762 --> 50:17.606
I asked for an interview,
but I didn't get one.

50:17.681 --> 50:19.183
Right. And just
as a little preface,

50:19.308 --> 50:20.810
I might just clear up one thing.

50:20.893 --> 50:22.691
The reason you
didn't get it, Paul...

50:22.770 --> 50:25.690
I wanted to make sure that was you
'cause I don't know what you look like.

50:26.690 --> 50:32.038
When I decided to come back, for
what I think is a very noble reason,

50:32.112 --> 50:37.744
you said, "Folks, the cancer has
been in remission for four years,

50:37.826 --> 50:40.875
"but our cancer
has now returned."

50:41.956 --> 50:44.084
Meaning me.

50:44.166 --> 50:46.385
I am here to fight this disease.

50:46.460 --> 50:48.383
I am here so that
I don't have to deal with it,

50:48.462 --> 50:50.009
you don't have to deal with it,

50:50.089 --> 50:53.389
none of us have to deal with it, my
children don't have to deal with it.

50:53.467 --> 50:56.016
But yet you said
that I am the cancer,

50:56.095 --> 50:58.189
and the cancer is
out of remission.

50:58.264 --> 51:01.063
So I think it goes
without saying, no,

51:01.141 --> 51:03.894
we're not gonna sit down
and do an interview.

51:03.978 --> 51:06.197
And I don't think
anybody in this room

51:06.313 --> 51:08.566
would sit down
for that interview.

51:08.649 --> 51:12.074
You are not worth the chair that you're
sitting on with a statement like that,

51:12.152 --> 51:17.033
with a disease that touches
everybody around the world.

51:17.116 --> 51:18.789
Lance was
threatened there, and the only

51:18.867 --> 51:21.040
thing he knows what
to do is to fight back.

51:21.120 --> 51:22.417
I have to say,
at least in the footage,

51:22.538 --> 51:23.938
you look a little
bit uncomfortable.

51:24.915 --> 51:26.132
Yeah, you think?

51:26.208 --> 51:27.926
That's one of those moments
where you're thinking,

51:28.002 --> 51:30.175
"Why the hell did you
come back to this sport?

51:30.254 --> 51:31.676
"Why do you want to
deal with this stuff?"

51:31.755 --> 51:33.007
I mean, here he was,

51:34.300 --> 51:38.350
a successful, retired athlete, and had
everything he wanted in the world.

51:38.429 --> 51:41.103
Why would you want to come
back and suffer with us?

51:42.016 --> 51:43.518
This sport is not
glamorous at all.

51:43.601 --> 51:46.901
I mean, you go out, ride in
30 degrees in pouring rain.

51:46.979 --> 51:49.653
You just suffer on
the bike all the time.

51:49.815 --> 51:51.817
And yet he wanted
to come back to it

51:51.900 --> 51:54.744
and prove a point,
send a message.

51:55.613 --> 51:57.661
Let's go, Lance!

52:04.038 --> 52:08.043
♪ Well I stumbled
in the darkness

52:08.125 --> 52:11.049
♪ I'm lost and alone

52:12.171 --> 52:15.095
♪ Though I said I'd go before us

52:16.675 --> 52:19.428
♪ And show the way back home

52:21.055 --> 52:24.355
♪ There a light up ahead

52:25.267 --> 52:27.770
♪ I can't hold onto her arm

52:29.897 --> 52:35.404
♪ Forgive me pretty baby but I
always take the long way home

52:36.362 --> 52:40.117
♪ Money's just
something you throw

52:40.199 --> 52:43.169
♪ Off the back of a train

52:44.370 --> 52:47.249
♪ Got a head full of lightning

52:48.999 --> 52:51.752
♪ A hat full of rain

52:53.253 --> 52:56.803
♪ Watch your back
if I should tell you

52:57.591 --> 53:00.970
♪ Love's the only thing
I've ever known

53:01.929 --> 53:07.811
♪ One thing for sure pretty baby I
always take the long way home I

53:10.604 --> 53:13.528
The misery of the rain
stung one rider more than most.

53:13.607 --> 53:16.656
Lance's old teammate,
Floyd Landis.

53:16.735 --> 53:19.454
Floyd had ridden with Lance
for three Tour wins.

53:19.530 --> 53:23.831
He'd also won the Tour on his own,
only to be busted for doping.

53:24.451 --> 53:26.328
In the middle of the pack,
he wondered,

53:26.412 --> 53:28.335
why should he be
treated as a cheater

53:28.414 --> 53:33.045
while his old teammate, Lance
Armstrong, was welcomed back as a hero?

53:36.547 --> 53:38.299
Great job, boys.
Congratulations.

53:39.466 --> 53:42.094
Floyd actually
contacted Johan Bruyneel,

53:42.177 --> 53:44.555
and he said, "Can I just
get a spot on your team?"

53:44.638 --> 53:45.730
And Bruyneel said, "Look.

53:45.806 --> 53:48.605
"You're radioactive in cycling.
We can't have you on our team.

53:48.726 --> 53:52.276
"We're trying to portray ourselves
as this clean cycling team

53:52.354 --> 53:54.652
"and you're
a convicted doper."

53:57.025 --> 54:00.074
Landis was enraged about the
hypocrisy there, right?

54:00.154 --> 54:03.408
Here's Johan Bruyneel
talking about a clean team

54:03.490 --> 54:05.538
with Lance Armstrong
as its biggest star.

54:05.617 --> 54:08.496
Of course, Floyd knows all
the details of the truth.

54:09.079 --> 54:11.923
It was pretty tough
for him to swallow that.

54:13.834 --> 54:17.589
The undertow of Floyd's
resentment would, in the end,

54:17.671 --> 54:20.675
lead to the downfall
of Lance Armstrong.

54:23.260 --> 54:24.762
Anybody else want to
write a message on the ground

54:24.845 --> 54:26.768
for the Lance
Armstrong Foundation?

54:26.847 --> 54:29.020
Hope rides again.
Hope rides again.

54:31.059 --> 54:33.733
Lance!
I'm getting my pen ready!

54:33.812 --> 54:36.156
There was a huge
energy at Tour of California.

54:36.231 --> 54:37.904
It was almost like
he's a movie star.

54:37.983 --> 54:39.951
There were people there that
know nothing about cycling,

54:40.027 --> 54:41.950
and they were just screaming,
reaching over

54:42.029 --> 54:44.873
the barriers, trying to touch
the great hope.

54:44.948 --> 54:47.371
My grandpa loves you.

54:48.786 --> 54:51.130
Will you sign this for my mom?
She's a cancer survivor.

54:52.372 --> 54:54.374
This is a special year.
I wanted to come back,

54:54.458 --> 54:57.132
and I wanted to tell this Livestrong
message around the world.

54:57.211 --> 54:59.213
Some mock Livestrong
as nothing more than

54:59.338 --> 55:01.306
a front to hide Lance's doping.

55:01.381 --> 55:03.099
But I didn't see it that way.

55:03.175 --> 55:08.147
Livestrong had raised over $300
million to support cancer victims.

55:08.222 --> 55:10.395
And 70 million
people around the world

55:10.557 --> 55:12.730
proudly wore those
yellow wristbands.

55:18.899 --> 55:19.991
All right.

55:20.108 --> 55:21.155
Thank you!

55:21.235 --> 55:23.988
- What's he racing for?
- Sorry?

55:24.071 --> 55:25.448
What's he racing for?

55:25.572 --> 55:26.994
To raise money for cancer.

55:27.074 --> 55:28.792
He raises money?
Yeah, to help...

55:28.867 --> 55:29.867
And then he gives it to us?

55:29.910 --> 55:30.911
Yeah.

55:32.162 --> 55:34.540
The ones who always
stick with you are kids.

55:34.623 --> 55:37.126
There's nothing like
seeing a kid with cancer.

55:37.209 --> 55:38.677
Visibly with cancer.

55:38.752 --> 55:41.005
And at the same time,
there's nothing like

55:41.129 --> 55:43.382
seeing the parents of
a child with cancer.

55:43.465 --> 55:46.969
So, while I've been that
patient, now I'm a parent.

55:47.094 --> 55:51.816
And I can't imagine being that mom
or that dad in that hospital room,

55:51.890 --> 55:56.316
looking down on a 5-year-old that's
weak, that doesn't want to eat.

55:56.395 --> 55:59.023
Just hanging out? Yeah?

55:59.106 --> 56:01.484
It's a little crazy
in there. Yeah.

56:01.567 --> 56:04.446
There are some
crazy girls in there.

56:04.528 --> 56:06.997
I wouldn't go in there. No.

56:07.072 --> 56:10.747
I've seen him with
kids in the cancer wards.

56:10.826 --> 56:14.456
And I also know people he's
reached out to, and that's real.

56:14.538 --> 56:17.462
It's as genuine as sort of
that fury he has on the bike.

56:17.541 --> 56:18.838
Hello!

56:18.917 --> 56:20.965
We heard lots of
different things about Lance.

56:21.044 --> 56:23.763
"Maybe he's doping."
"He's not a nice guy."

56:23.839 --> 56:27.218
But all of a sudden, there are
wards full of people who think,

56:27.301 --> 56:31.022
"Not only can I beat this disease,
I can be better than I was."

56:31.096 --> 56:32.348
Good luck.

56:32.431 --> 56:37.528
Ultimately, the chasm between
being this hero and the reality of it

56:37.603 --> 56:40.072
just bothered people hugely.

56:40.147 --> 56:43.993
He thought that, "Because I raised so much
money and I gave so many people hope,

56:44.067 --> 56:46.035
"it allows me to do what
I did." No, it doesn't.

56:46.737 --> 56:48.159
The critics say I'm arrogant.

56:52.242 --> 56:53.994
A doper.

56:56.830 --> 56:57.956
Washed up.

57:01.126 --> 57:03.003
A fraud.

57:06.423 --> 57:08.175
That I couldn't let it go.

57:11.929 --> 57:14.352
They can say whatever they want.

57:14.431 --> 57:17.685
I'm not back on
my bike for them.

57:35.369 --> 57:37.292
The Tour of Italy
would be Lance's

57:37.371 --> 57:39.715
vital warm-up for
the Tour de France.

57:39.790 --> 57:42.464
He was determined to
see how he would fare

57:42.542 --> 57:45.386
riding clean against
the best riders in the world.

57:47.881 --> 57:50.054
I look to have some good days.

57:50.133 --> 57:52.807
If I left the Tour of Italy,
and I didn't win a stage

57:52.886 --> 57:55.639
and I wasn't a factor
on some of the difficult days,

57:55.722 --> 57:59.397
I'd be disappointed,
and I think I have to do that.

58:01.144 --> 58:03.613
To challenge
his critics, Lance started

58:03.730 --> 58:06.233
to post his blood
values during the Giro.

58:06.316 --> 58:07.909
Based on those findings,

58:07.985 --> 58:10.204
even the most
skeptical observers

58:10.320 --> 58:12.493
concluded that
Lance was riding clean.

58:12.572 --> 58:15.701
The big question was,
"Could he still compete?"

58:15.784 --> 58:22.167
Anytime you see him, if he's
in trouble, he can never be alone.

58:22.249 --> 58:27.881
So, Dani, Jani and Chechu, on the
climb, you guys look for Lance.

58:27.963 --> 58:30.057
And if there's a problem,
he needs guys to

58:30.173 --> 58:32.267
stay with him and
pace him up the climb.

58:44.855 --> 58:47.825
On this day's
final climb, Lance cracked

58:47.941 --> 58:50.911
and dropped way
behind all the top racers.

58:50.986 --> 58:53.614
His supporting riders
slowed down to stay with him.

58:56.033 --> 59:00.379
It's tough because I put
pressure on myself and expect to...

59:00.454 --> 59:03.173
In my mind, I think back to
what it used to be like.

59:03.248 --> 59:07.253
And you forget that you've
been away for a few years.

59:09.296 --> 59:11.139
It's hard, man.
It's not easy to be away.

59:11.214 --> 59:16.095
And you can feel that...

59:35.030 --> 59:36.498
Blood, urine, both?
Both.

59:36.573 --> 59:38.075
Both, cool.

59:40.035 --> 59:42.879
Yesterday was
number 31, I believe.

59:44.247 --> 59:45.749
Blood and urine.

59:45.832 --> 59:48.255
More than anybody else.

59:48.335 --> 59:53.091
While I do the blood, I don't want
that the cameras will film it.

59:53.173 --> 59:54.470
And also when we go to...

59:54.591 --> 59:55.888
Whose blood is it?

59:57.677 --> 01:00:01.773
It's a Dopingkontrollstation,
and it's not public.

01:00:01.848 --> 01:00:06.775
We've had this... Yeah, you
can call PWC or the UCI.

01:00:06.853 --> 01:00:11.450
I know it's not comfortable for
you, but it's my right, so...

01:00:11.525 --> 01:00:13.619
Okay.
We're gonna film it.

01:00:13.693 --> 01:00:15.695
It's my blood and my urine.

01:00:17.531 --> 01:00:19.408
Yeah, but...

01:00:19.533 --> 01:00:21.410
Go ahead and call the UCI.

01:00:21.493 --> 01:00:25.794
Nobody else than you and I,
we are going to the toilet.

01:00:25.872 --> 01:00:28.216
Yeah, that's obvious.

01:00:42.013 --> 01:00:43.560
Hello.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.563
Hi, Bella.

01:00:47.269 --> 01:00:52.150
The biggest dilemma gets
to be that your home is your home.

01:00:52.232 --> 01:00:54.576
You're there and you're eating
breakfast with your kids,

01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:56.449
and they're getting
ready for day camp

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:58.322
and you're
thinking about your day,

01:00:58.405 --> 01:01:00.407
and then these people just
kind of come into your world,

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:02.709
and it could take
close to an hour.

01:01:02.784 --> 01:01:05.003
If you can't go to the bathroom,
it could take longer than that.

01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:06.421
They sit there
and wait with you.

01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:08.464
Is this the biggest
audience you've ever had?

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:09.837
Yes.

01:01:11.334 --> 01:01:14.634
Nobody thinks that's normal.

01:01:14.713 --> 01:01:16.215
We're used to it.

01:01:16.298 --> 01:01:17.766
A few of the haters in the press

01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:20.640
and these people that are just on
this whole anti-doping frenzy,

01:01:20.719 --> 01:01:22.221
which I think we need...
There's a place for that,

01:01:22.304 --> 01:01:23.977
but there are people
that are obsessed with it.

01:01:24.055 --> 01:01:26.216
They think that's absolutely normal.
That's not normal.

01:01:26.808 --> 01:01:29.357
Why are you taking blood, Dad?

01:01:29.436 --> 01:01:31.109
For my job.

01:01:32.439 --> 01:01:34.612
His job is to take blood.

01:01:36.443 --> 01:01:37.444
No, her job is to take blood.

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:38.904
My job is to take blood.

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:42.748
My job is to give blood.

01:01:42.866 --> 01:01:43.867
Oh.

01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:47.037
All right.

01:01:49.289 --> 01:01:51.633
Bye-bye, cameraman.

01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:55.588
Bye-bye, cameraman
and funny, skinny man.

01:01:57.464 --> 01:01:58.465
Go!

01:01:59.966 --> 01:02:01.388
Let me tell you something.

01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:05.730
I'm all for a clean game, but
this is fucking ridiculous.

01:02:06.973 --> 01:02:08.350
Now here we are.

01:02:08.433 --> 01:02:12.779
Yesterday, we had a surprise UCI
control, the 31st of the season.

01:02:12.854 --> 01:02:14.197
Now, this morning, again.

01:02:14.272 --> 01:02:16.445
See you pull up.
Fine, no problem.

01:02:16.524 --> 01:02:18.526
32nd control.
Then, Higgs, look.

01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:20.738
USADA walks in.

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:22.413
Talk about a broken system.

01:02:23.865 --> 01:02:25.367
Stupid.

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:30.084
How can there not
be any communication?

01:02:30.163 --> 01:02:31.790
It's 2009.

01:02:33.333 --> 01:02:35.552
You guys look like fools.

01:02:35.627 --> 01:02:37.925
When I'm in the bathroom,
going to the bathroom, I look outside,

01:02:38.004 --> 01:02:39.506
another car pulls up.

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:41.933
And it's the American
Anti-Doping Agency.

01:02:42.008 --> 01:02:45.888
So 10 minutes before, the International
Cycling Federation shows up,

01:02:45.971 --> 01:02:49.475
and then the American Olympic
Federation shows up.

01:02:49.557 --> 01:02:52.811
And I've got to
get dressed to ride.

01:02:52.894 --> 01:02:55.864
So I gotta go up and change and
everybody's gonna escort me up there?

01:02:55.939 --> 01:02:57.612
In front of my girlfriend,
who's breastfeeding?

01:02:57.691 --> 01:02:59.284
Is that the way it's gonna work?

01:02:59.359 --> 01:03:01.282
Okay.
No.

01:03:01.361 --> 01:03:03.113
So I gotta walk in
where you can't see me,

01:03:03.238 --> 01:03:04.956
and you say,
"No, that's a violation"?

01:03:05.031 --> 01:03:06.533
That's stupid.

01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:09.123
Anyways, off we go.

01:03:09.202 --> 01:03:10.875
Six hours on the bike today.

01:03:12.122 --> 01:03:13.123
See you.

01:03:20.046 --> 01:03:22.265
After his poor
performance in Italy,

01:03:22.382 --> 01:03:24.601
Lance had to find
some way to get better.

01:03:24.676 --> 01:03:26.724
With only a month
before the Tour de France,

01:03:26.803 --> 01:03:31.354
Lance trained in Aspen with his
Astana teammate, Levi Leipheimer.

01:03:33.268 --> 01:03:36.818
For both men, riding in the Rockies
was all about the altitude.

01:03:36.896 --> 01:03:40.776
Training in the thin air causes the
body to produce more red blood cells,

01:03:40.859 --> 01:03:43.988
the exact same effect as EPO.

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:47.916
I learned that altitude training
also played a role in doping.

01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:49.789
To prepare for competition,

01:03:49.868 --> 01:03:51.495
riders would often
train in the mountains

01:03:51.619 --> 01:03:53.212
to boost their red blood cells,

01:03:53.288 --> 01:03:57.885
take out a bag or two, and then be
ready to transfuse them during a tour.

01:03:57.959 --> 01:04:02.214
At the time, I wondered, "Was that
what Lance was doing in Aspen?"

01:04:04.591 --> 01:04:07.811
I watched Lance and Levi
do a series of 1K tests,

01:04:07.886 --> 01:04:10.264
timed runs up
a one-kilometer hill

01:04:10.388 --> 01:04:12.766
with a blood test at
the top of each climb.

01:04:14.392 --> 01:04:16.144
They measure lactic acid levels,

01:04:16.227 --> 01:04:19.527
which indicate fitness and the
ability of a rider's leg muscles

01:04:19.606 --> 01:04:22.029
to deliver
sustained power over time.

01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:27.865
It's a test that was developed and
refined in Italy by Michele Ferrari.

01:04:27.947 --> 01:04:29.415
Okay.

01:04:30.658 --> 01:04:34.253
You still pass on a suggestion
or two from time to time to Lance?

01:04:34.329 --> 01:04:36.673
Yes, not so many as in the past.

01:04:36.748 --> 01:04:39.718
But probably,
he doesn't need so many.

01:04:39.793 --> 01:04:44.344
But sometimes I
give him some inputs.

01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:46.842
May be useful.

01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:50.512
They were useful.

01:04:50.595 --> 01:04:52.393
Lance had told
everyone that he had

01:04:52.472 --> 01:04:55.100
stopped working
with Ferrari in 2004,

01:04:55.183 --> 01:04:57.527
but an investigation
by Italian police

01:04:57.602 --> 01:04:59.650
revealed that
Armstrong kept contact

01:04:59.771 --> 01:05:01.819
with Ferrari
through his son Stefano.

01:05:01.898 --> 01:05:05.823
In e-mails, Papa Ferrari was
known by his nickname, Schumi.

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:08.493
Bank records and
e-mails confirmed

01:05:08.655 --> 01:05:11.283
Armstrong's payments to Ferrari.

01:05:11.783 --> 01:05:14.582
In 2009, I wasn't honest
about my relationship with him,

01:05:14.661 --> 01:05:19.508
but I didn't know who else to trust
when it came to training and advice.

01:05:20.125 --> 01:05:24.096
And to his credit, he was the first
to say, "You cannot take any risk.

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:27.299
"They are coming for you.

01:05:27.382 --> 01:05:29.225
"They want you."

01:05:29.843 --> 01:05:33.347
From Italy, Ferrari
monitored Lance's progress.

01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:35.524
He compared his performance
from a month earlier

01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:38.226
and concluded that Lance
had improved by 10%

01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:41.939
in his power output number,
watts per kilogram.

01:05:42.021 --> 01:05:45.992
The watts-per-kilo
number now is just a hair under 6.5.

01:05:46.067 --> 01:05:48.741
6.5 might be good
enough to win the Tour.

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:52.120
I've seen higher.
I've been higher.

01:05:52.198 --> 01:05:55.498
The best Lance
with 1K tests was 7.

01:05:55.577 --> 01:05:57.329
More than 7.

01:05:57.412 --> 01:06:01.167
The best Lance was
the year of the last Tour win.

01:06:01.374 --> 01:06:03.001
2005.

01:06:03.084 --> 01:06:05.337
He won the Tour like this.

01:06:06.546 --> 01:06:08.344
It was impressive.

01:06:08.423 --> 01:06:10.676
Lance took it easy, because...

01:06:12.302 --> 01:06:15.897
if you win by too much...

01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:17.895
everybody blah, blah, blah...

01:06:18.099 --> 01:06:20.943
The other seven Tours...

01:06:21.019 --> 01:06:23.613
In late June, you know,
the last test before the Tour

01:06:23.688 --> 01:06:28.990
based on power output, we sat
down and said, "Okay. We win.

01:06:29.068 --> 01:06:32.072
"If we don't fall off the
bike, if you don't get sick,

01:06:32.155 --> 01:06:36.126
"if you don't have any kind of
terrible strategic error,

01:06:36.201 --> 01:06:37.919
"you win easy."

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:39.120
it was amazing.

01:06:39.204 --> 01:06:41.081
4.5?
At 326.

01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:42.416
At 326?

01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:45.214
326.

01:06:45.293 --> 01:06:47.842
Oh, snap! 4.7.

01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:52.137
He pushed too hard on my finger.

01:06:52.217 --> 01:06:53.639
I'm strong.

01:06:53.718 --> 01:06:55.561
Quite honestly, I think...

01:06:57.263 --> 01:07:01.439
I mean, if you want a prediction,
I think I'll win the Tour.

01:07:02.101 --> 01:07:04.570
How could Lance be so confident?

01:07:04.646 --> 01:07:07.024
He hadn't
performed well all year.

01:07:07.106 --> 01:07:09.484
What did he know that I didn't?

01:07:09.567 --> 01:07:11.035
We are close to the moment

01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:14.114
when big Lance returns
to the sport of cycling.

01:07:14.197 --> 01:07:18.202
And when he left in 2005,
he wouldn't be back, he said.

01:07:18.284 --> 01:07:20.207
There he is. He's back.

01:07:24.707 --> 01:07:26.300
Going good.
Going good. Going good.

01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:27.969
Demand it.
Accelerate your body.

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:29.796
Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:07:30.255 --> 01:07:32.257
In the first stage,
a short time trial,

01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:34.468
Lance wanted to
make a statement.

01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:37.896
In the past, he had always
dominated time trials.

01:07:37.971 --> 01:07:41.646
An impressive performance here
would show everyone he was back.

01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:47.860
He doesn't look good to me.

01:07:50.984 --> 01:07:52.907
Come on, Lance.
Come on, come on. Pick it up.

01:07:52.986 --> 01:07:55.239
Come on, come on.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:07:57.824 --> 01:08:00.577
One kilometer.
One kilometer. Hello?

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:03.288
Yes, I'm in the race now.
I'm in the race.

01:08:03.371 --> 01:08:04.873
I'm in the race. Call me back.

01:08:04.956 --> 01:08:06.082
Look at his face.

01:08:06.165 --> 01:08:08.588
Lance Armstrong, seven times
the winner of Tour de France.

01:08:08.668 --> 01:08:10.386
He's headed for the best time.

01:08:21.055 --> 01:08:24.104
Lance's time put him
in first place by 30 seconds,

01:08:24.183 --> 01:08:26.685
but with all the best
riders still to come.

01:08:30.481 --> 01:08:32.654
Cancellara
pushes on for the finish.

01:08:32.734 --> 01:08:36.078
He's looking to beat the time
of Bradley Wiggins of 19:51.

01:08:36.154 --> 01:08:39.328
He's sprinting for
the line and the best time.

01:08:39.407 --> 01:08:42.160
One by one,
the best riders in the world,

01:08:42.243 --> 01:08:45.212
including his Astana teammate,
Alberto Contador,

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:46.915
beat his time.

01:08:46.997 --> 01:08:52.470
A great ride by Alberto
Contador, who won the Tour in 2007.

01:08:52.545 --> 01:08:54.171
Contador is second.

01:08:54.255 --> 01:08:55.973
Is he now the leader of Astana?

01:08:56.049 --> 01:08:57.892
He certainly laid claim to that.

01:08:59.551 --> 01:09:01.805
Lance finished
the first stage in 10th place,

01:09:01.888 --> 01:09:03.765
40 seconds behind the leader,

01:09:03.848 --> 01:09:07.273
and 22 seconds behind his
teammate, Alberto Contador.

01:09:13.733 --> 01:09:16.828
From the start, I watched
Lance's comeback hopes collide

01:09:16.903 --> 01:09:18.325
with a ferocious rider

01:09:18.404 --> 01:09:22.203
who bore an eerie resemblance
to Armstrong 10 years earlier.

01:09:22.283 --> 01:09:24.001
These guys never
talked to each other.

01:09:24.077 --> 01:09:25.453
They came out of the bus,

01:09:25.536 --> 01:09:28.506
I never once saw them look at
each other, make eye contact.

01:09:28.581 --> 01:09:30.504
They would walk
right past each other.

01:09:30.582 --> 01:09:32.756
It was the weirdest thing.

01:09:32.835 --> 01:09:35.212
The honest truth is that there's

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:37.011
a little tension
at the dinner table.

01:09:38.216 --> 01:09:40.218
The truth is...

01:09:40.301 --> 01:09:42.929
I have seen Lance's statements,

01:09:43.095 --> 01:09:45.724
but on my side
there are no tensions.

01:09:45.807 --> 01:09:48.229
I'm completely relaxed...

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:51.104
He's got the gunslinger hat on.

01:09:52.270 --> 01:09:54.023
Journalists behind...
That would drive me nuts.

01:09:54.107 --> 01:09:56.075
This guy's gonna
fall in the fucking water.

01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:58.949
That would drive me nuts,
people behind me.

01:10:01.739 --> 01:10:04.913
The Tour de France is the
world's most demanding sporting event.

01:10:04.992 --> 01:10:07.871
It covers 2,200
miles over three weeks.

01:10:07.954 --> 01:10:13.711
The 21 daily stages combine flat
roads, brutal climbs and time trials.

01:10:13.793 --> 01:10:15.466
Each day, among the entire group

01:10:15.628 --> 01:10:17.346
of cyclists,
known as the "peloton,"

01:10:17.422 --> 01:10:19.516
the rider with
the fastest overall time

01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:21.888
wears the yellow jersey,
or the maillot jaune.

01:10:25.096 --> 01:10:27.770
While each team on
the Tour has nine riders,

01:10:27.849 --> 01:10:29.817
usually just one,
the team leader,

01:10:29.976 --> 01:10:31.899
is riding for the yellow jersey.

01:10:31.978 --> 01:10:34.106
On Astana,
Armstrong and Contador

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:36.324
are dueling for
the right to lead.

01:10:37.316 --> 01:10:41.662
The other cyclists were known as
"domestiques French for "servants."

01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:44.495
Ludi has no arm warmers.

01:10:46.451 --> 01:10:47.748
This, this. Okay.

01:10:47.827 --> 01:10:50.080
Who else? Anybody else?

01:10:52.165 --> 01:10:56.420
An energy bar for Alberto.

01:10:56.502 --> 01:10:57.674
This?

01:11:35.208 --> 01:11:37.176
Another job
of the domestiques is

01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:39.216
to shelter team
leaders from the wind.

01:11:40.087 --> 01:11:42.385
When riding at high
speeds on flat roads,

01:11:42.507 --> 01:11:44.760
the effects of wind
resistance are huge.

01:11:44.842 --> 01:11:48.517
Riders in front have to work
as much as 30% harder

01:11:48.596 --> 01:11:50.690
than those sheltering behind.

01:11:50.765 --> 01:11:53.314
At high speeds,
you can see the domestiques,

01:11:53.392 --> 01:11:55.065
often from different teams,

01:11:55.144 --> 01:11:57.897
sharing the work of
fighting the wind.

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:01.818
For Lance's victories,

01:12:01.901 --> 01:12:05.951
there were some where he rode in front
by himself only a matter of minutes,

01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:08.328
like three to five
minutes for the entire Tour,

01:12:08.407 --> 01:12:10.125
because he essentially
is using the muscle

01:12:10.243 --> 01:12:11.995
of his team as
an extension of himself

01:12:12.078 --> 01:12:14.672
to drive forward and to
burn other people off.

01:12:15.289 --> 01:12:17.417
Relying on
a group of domestiques,

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.548
Lance found
a way to use the wind

01:12:19.627 --> 01:12:21.550
when the cyclists
rode near the ocean

01:12:21.629 --> 01:12:24.223
and sea breezes
whipped into the peloton.

01:12:24.882 --> 01:12:30.355
We were coming into that
corner, and I was about 40 guys back.

01:12:30.429 --> 01:12:32.102
And I was kind of like,

01:12:32.807 --> 01:12:34.730
"I better move up."

01:12:35.268 --> 01:12:38.021
The crosswinds
caused a split in the peloton.

01:12:38.104 --> 01:12:41.199
Lance and two of his domestiques
made it to the front group.

01:12:41.274 --> 01:12:43.151
The rest of his
Astana teammates,

01:12:43.234 --> 01:12:45.362
including Contador,
were left behind.

01:12:45.778 --> 01:12:47.246
In this situation,

01:12:47.321 --> 01:12:50.325
Lance reached out to an old
teammate now on a different team,

01:12:50.408 --> 01:12:52.035
George Hincapie.

01:12:52.118 --> 01:12:55.543
I had to call in some
favors, George and those guys.

01:12:55.621 --> 01:13:00.047
I said,
"George, you keep riding.

01:13:00.126 --> 01:13:01.628
"Hard."

01:13:03.629 --> 01:13:05.677
Just like I would
do in the old days

01:13:05.756 --> 01:13:08.054
when he was on the same team.

01:13:08.134 --> 01:13:11.183
I just remember Lance being all fired
up that he was in the first group

01:13:11.262 --> 01:13:13.640
and asking us to go harder,

01:13:13.723 --> 01:13:16.397
and we're like, "Dude, we're
doing our own thing here.

01:13:16.475 --> 01:13:19.570
"Sure, you're here, but we're
not really doing this for you."

01:13:19.645 --> 01:13:21.085
They could be
putting Lance Armstrong

01:13:21.147 --> 01:13:22.444
in yellow in the next 24 hours.

01:13:22.523 --> 01:13:25.743
Little bit further back down the
road, that is Alberto Contador.

01:13:25.818 --> 01:13:27.195
He got caught out,
but he's keeping

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:28.742
at the front end
of the main field.

01:13:28.821 --> 01:13:30.289
But I wonder what he's thinking

01:13:30.364 --> 01:13:32.742
about the presence of Lance
Armstrong in that little group.

01:13:32.825 --> 01:13:35.078
French radio was like,
"This is a betrayal."

01:13:35.161 --> 01:13:36.879
Betrayal?

01:13:36.954 --> 01:13:39.628
It's like,
"Why is he riding out front?

01:13:39.707 --> 01:13:42.551
"Why is he pulling? Why don't
they wait for Alberto?"

01:13:42.627 --> 01:13:44.846
Because I won the fucking
Tour de France seven times.

01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:48.801
That's why we're out there riding.
That's not...

01:13:48.883 --> 01:13:50.601
That's stupid.

01:13:51.177 --> 01:13:53.020
If you can take
advantage of the wind

01:13:53.179 --> 01:13:55.022
or any other
situation like that,

01:13:55.097 --> 01:13:56.599
that's the way you race bikes.

01:13:56.682 --> 01:13:58.229
That's the way
you win bike races.

01:13:58.309 --> 01:14:00.607
We were in the right
place at the right time,

01:14:00.686 --> 01:14:04.190
and I deserved to
have those guys ride.

01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:05.616
That's what I told Johan.

01:14:05.691 --> 01:14:10.413
"You better start getting
used to this again because..."

01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:15.960
The breakaway finished
41 seconds ahead of the peloton,

01:14:16.035 --> 01:14:18.254
enough to move Lance
from 10th to third,

01:14:18.329 --> 01:14:21.299
nineteen seconds
ahead of Contador.

01:14:21.374 --> 01:14:24.799
Suddenly, Lance's comeback
was looking pretty good.

01:14:24.877 --> 01:14:26.379
If everything goes right,

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:28.556
I mean,
if it goes perfectly for us

01:14:28.673 --> 01:14:30.767
and not that
great for the others,

01:14:31.384 --> 01:14:32.886
we take the yellow jersey.

01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:34.971
It would be...

01:14:35.054 --> 01:14:36.534
You don't wanna
take the yellow jersey

01:14:36.555 --> 01:14:37.898
this early in the Tour, do you?

01:14:38.766 --> 01:14:40.985
Sure. I'd take it.

01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:42.983
Hell, yeah.

01:14:43.062 --> 01:14:45.736
Four years later, why not?

01:14:45.815 --> 01:14:47.533
I'd totally take it.

01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:50.987
I'm pedaling tomorrow for that.

01:14:53.531 --> 01:14:57.206
Looking back on that moment
now, I admit that I was caught up.

01:14:57.284 --> 01:15:00.083
I wasn't naive about
past doping allegations,

01:15:00.162 --> 01:15:02.540
but I couldn't help
but root for the old pro,

01:15:02.623 --> 01:15:04.876
and he promised he
was doing it clean.

01:15:14.093 --> 01:15:16.767
But my presence at the Tour
and my access to Lance

01:15:16.846 --> 01:15:19.816
was mystifying to
Lance's longtime critics.

01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:26.023
It was perceived that you were
making the puff piece on Lance.

01:15:26.188 --> 01:15:28.407
I thought it was
odd that you were

01:15:28.524 --> 01:15:30.697
doing a movie
about the comeback,

01:15:30.776 --> 01:15:36.078
because it seemed like it was going
to be an inspirational movie.

01:15:36.282 --> 01:15:40.537
The fear was that you would
buy into the bullshit.

01:15:40.953 --> 01:15:44.207
I was afraid I was starting
to buy into the bullshit, too,

01:15:44.290 --> 01:15:46.167
so I sought out
Jonathan Vaughters.

01:15:46.292 --> 01:15:49.922
He was running Team Garmin, the
so-called anti-doping team.

01:15:50.004 --> 01:15:52.223
But he wouldn't
agree to talk to me.

01:15:52.298 --> 01:15:54.300
Back then,
he had not yet made public

01:15:54.425 --> 01:15:56.348
what he knew
about Lance's doping.

01:15:56.427 --> 01:16:00.307
People have to realize
that the truth in all this was hard.

01:16:00.389 --> 01:16:04.144
Such a huge number of people
wanted to believe so bad

01:16:04.727 --> 01:16:07.731
that they hated
anyone who didn't believe

01:16:07.813 --> 01:16:09.907
and hated anyone
who questioned it.

01:16:10.483 --> 01:16:13.453
As a team manager, imagine what
the reaction would've been

01:16:13.527 --> 01:16:15.575
had I said
something about Lance.

01:16:15.654 --> 01:16:17.452
Lose the team Lose the riders.

01:16:17.531 --> 01:16:19.204
You know, lose the whole thing.

01:16:19.867 --> 01:16:23.542
As it happened, Vaughters
had a dog in the hunt in 2009,

01:16:23.621 --> 01:16:26.215
Bradley Wiggins was
one of the leaders

01:16:26.290 --> 01:16:29.134
and Lance's team
was worried about him.

01:16:29.877 --> 01:16:31.754
We want to get rid of Wiggins.

01:16:31.837 --> 01:16:33.339
You, too?

01:16:36.592 --> 01:16:38.765
I know that ultimately you
want to get rid of us, too,

01:16:38.844 --> 01:16:40.187
but that's another story.

01:16:42.098 --> 01:16:44.772
Everyone at the Tour
was playing angles.

01:16:44.850 --> 01:16:47.979
Greg LeMond, the former Tour
winner and longtime Lance critic,

01:16:48.062 --> 01:16:51.157
paid for a video crew
to tail Lance's comeback.

01:16:51.232 --> 01:16:54.281
Their mission, according to the
cameraman in the straw cowboy hat,

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:56.863
was to make
the anti-Gibney film.

01:16:57.738 --> 01:16:59.240
I was caught in
the middle of a battle

01:16:59.323 --> 01:17:02.293
between the myth-makers
and the myth-busters.

01:17:02.368 --> 01:17:05.747
One of the strangest subplots
was Lance's interview strategy.

01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:09.460
He insisted that the only American
to be able to interview him

01:17:09.542 --> 01:17:11.010
would be Frankie Andrea,

01:17:11.085 --> 01:17:13.964
an ex-teammate he had
feuded with for years.

01:17:14.046 --> 01:17:15.639
Lance has multiple motivations.

01:17:15.714 --> 01:17:17.842
One of them was
sort of to show Frankie

01:17:17.925 --> 01:17:20.804
that he could still make
Frankie do whatever he wanted.

01:17:20.886 --> 01:17:22.388
One of them was to
show everyone that,

01:17:22.513 --> 01:17:24.015
"Hey, I can accept Frankie back.

01:17:24.098 --> 01:17:26.567
"I'm not the jerk."

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:28.565
Another one was to control
who had access to him.

01:17:28.644 --> 01:17:30.146
So all that was going on.

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:34.154
Months before, I was with
Lance when he hatched his plan

01:17:34.233 --> 01:17:38.579
to make Frankie wait outside the
bus every day to interview him.

01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:43.705
Johan begged him not to do it, but
Lance couldn't contain himself.

01:17:43.784 --> 01:17:46.207
When I asked him later
about the Frankie plot,

01:17:46.287 --> 01:17:47.789
Lance was back on message.

01:17:47.872 --> 01:17:49.749
But there wasn't anything
mischievous about it like,

01:17:49.832 --> 01:17:52.551
"Frankie's gonna have to come
to me now after those days."

01:17:52.626 --> 01:17:53.969
Absolutely not.

01:17:54.044 --> 01:17:56.012
No, this is totally different.

01:17:57.089 --> 01:18:00.013
The kids had been
watching the Tour on TV,

01:18:00.092 --> 01:18:02.845
and they said, "Mom,
Dad's interviewing Lance."

01:18:02.928 --> 01:18:05.056
Frankie called me right after

01:18:05.139 --> 01:18:08.109
and he said, "Lance wanted me,
and only me, to interview him."

01:18:08.184 --> 01:18:10.937
I said, "Frankie,
you should spit on that guy.

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:14.149
"After everything he's done to
you, done to me, done to us?"

01:18:14.273 --> 01:18:15.650
All right, thank you.
Yeah.

01:18:15.733 --> 01:18:17.406
And to say the
least, I was shocked

01:18:17.484 --> 01:18:19.407
because for four or
five years before that,

01:18:19.737 --> 01:18:21.660
we just walked
right past each other.

01:18:21.739 --> 01:18:24.242
No eye contact with me.
Wouldn't say a word to me.

01:18:25.951 --> 01:18:29.751
Lance, Frankie and his wife
Betsy had once been good friends.

01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:32.583
Frankie had been on
three US Postal teams,

01:18:32.666 --> 01:18:36.887
but in 2000, Lance's second Tour
win, Frankie wouldn't dope.

01:18:36.962 --> 01:18:39.806
He asked for a raise,
but the team director, Johan,

01:18:39.882 --> 01:18:42.556
told him he'd have to
take a steep pay cut.

01:18:42.635 --> 01:18:45.138
When Frankie
was looking at other teams,

01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:46.723
he had two other offers.

01:18:46.805 --> 01:18:48.398
He was on the phone with Johan

01:18:48.474 --> 01:18:51.227
who asked him, "Which teams
are you looking at?"

01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:53.813
And Frankie told
him the two teams.

01:18:55.022 --> 01:18:56.945
Offers rescinded.

01:18:58.525 --> 01:19:00.573
In late 2005, Frankie and Betsy

01:19:00.653 --> 01:19:04.954
were served with subpoenas to testify
in a lawsuit involving Lance.

01:19:05.616 --> 01:19:09.541
At issue was doping and a conversation
between Lance and his doctor

01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:11.372
while he was being
treated for cancer.

01:19:11.455 --> 01:19:12.502
Yeah.

01:19:12.706 --> 01:19:14.754
Let's talk about
the Indiana hospital room.

01:19:14.833 --> 01:19:17.552
Tell us what was said
during this conversation.

01:19:20.547 --> 01:19:22.265
A group of us
were inside of a room

01:19:22.341 --> 01:19:26.517
where Lance had mentioned that
he had taken certain drugs

01:19:26.595 --> 01:19:28.142
when a doctor
asked him about it.

01:19:28.222 --> 01:19:29.348
The doctor came in.

01:19:29.431 --> 01:19:32.401
I said to Lance, "I think we should
leave to give you your privacy."

01:19:32.476 --> 01:19:34.399
And Lance said, "No, that's okay.
You can stay."

01:19:34.478 --> 01:19:37.277
Were you present when that
conversation or statement took place?

01:19:37.356 --> 01:19:38.448
Yes.

01:19:38.524 --> 01:19:40.993
The doctor asked him
a couple of questions.

01:19:41.068 --> 01:19:42.786
And then came the question,

01:19:42.861 --> 01:19:47.708
"Have you ever taken any
performance-enhancing drugs?"

01:19:47.783 --> 01:19:49.456
Lance's response was
that he had taken...

01:19:49.535 --> 01:19:51.629
EPO, growth hormone...

01:19:51.704 --> 01:19:52.876
Cortisone...

01:19:52.955 --> 01:19:54.878
Steroids and testosterone.

01:19:56.208 --> 01:20:00.634
Do you deny the statements
that Ms. Andreu attributed to you

01:20:00.713 --> 01:20:02.886
in the Indiana
University Hospital?

01:20:02.965 --> 01:20:04.888
100%. Absolutely.

01:20:04.967 --> 01:20:06.640
Do you also deny
what Mr. Andreu

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:08.433
said regarding those statements?

01:20:08.512 --> 01:20:09.512
100%.

01:20:09.555 --> 01:20:11.649
How could it have taken place

01:20:11.724 --> 01:20:14.068
when I've never taken
performance-enhancing drugs?

01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:15.645
Look, how could
that have happened?

01:20:15.728 --> 01:20:17.776
That was my point. It's not
just simply you don't recall?

01:20:17.855 --> 01:20:19.323
How many times do
I have to say it?

01:20:19.398 --> 01:20:22.197
If you have a doping offense
or you test positive,

01:20:22.276 --> 01:20:25.496
it goes without saying that you're
fired from all of your contracts.

01:20:25.571 --> 01:20:30.998
Not just the team, but there's
numerous contracts that I have

01:20:31.076 --> 01:20:32.544
that would all go away.

01:20:32.619 --> 01:20:33.836
Sponsorship agreements,
for example.

01:20:33.954 --> 01:20:35.171
All of them.

01:20:35.247 --> 01:20:40.925
And the faith of all the cancer
survivors around the world.

01:20:41.003 --> 01:20:43.973
So everything I do off of the
bike would go away, too.

01:20:46.008 --> 01:20:48.932
And don't think for a second
I don't understand that.

01:20:50.929 --> 01:20:52.556
Yeah, that was...

01:20:52.681 --> 01:20:53.682
Um...

01:20:55.225 --> 01:20:58.229
Honestly,
it's embarrassing to hear.

01:20:59.563 --> 01:21:00.906
It's humiliating.

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:03.784
That was going too far.

01:21:03.859 --> 01:21:05.361
I know that now.

01:21:07.237 --> 01:21:08.910
I didn't at the time.

01:21:09.114 --> 01:21:10.866
Were you surprised
when Mr. Armstrong said

01:21:10.949 --> 01:21:13.202
he had taken those various
performance-enhancing drugs?

01:21:13.285 --> 01:21:14.582
Yeah, I was surprised.

01:21:14.661 --> 01:21:17.289
From that point on,
trying to do announcing gigs

01:21:17.373 --> 01:21:19.501
or commentary or work,
I was too controversial.

01:21:19.583 --> 01:21:21.085
And I was told that a lot.

01:21:21.168 --> 01:21:22.795
I was shunned,
banned, from everybody,

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:26.970
and a lot of people wouldn't
look at me, shake my hand.

01:21:27.049 --> 01:21:28.221
I was the outsider.

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:30.018
Lance wanted to
humiliate Frankie,

01:21:30.135 --> 01:21:31.887
and he wanted to get back at me.

01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:33.392
She swore to this, and Frankie,

01:21:33.472 --> 01:21:36.021
your former teammate and former
friend also swore to this.

01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:39.024
They had to be compelled to testify.
They did not want to testify.

01:21:39.103 --> 01:21:40.320
Why would they say this?

01:21:40.396 --> 01:21:43.445
You know, I was present
for Betsy's deposition

01:21:43.524 --> 01:21:45.743
and we asked her that question.

01:21:45.818 --> 01:21:47.912
We said something
to the effect of,

01:21:47.986 --> 01:21:50.705
"What do you think
of Lance Armstrong?"

01:21:50.781 --> 01:21:52.579
And, Bob, I've never been
in a room where somebody

01:21:52.658 --> 01:21:54.501
looks straight across the table
at you right in the eye,

01:21:54.576 --> 01:21:56.044
and she goes, "I hate him."

01:21:56.161 --> 01:21:57.641
There's some
allegations being made by

01:21:57.663 --> 01:21:59.506
the wife of a former
teammate of yours,

01:21:59.915 --> 01:22:04.011
again accusing you of using
performance-enhancing drugs.

01:22:04.169 --> 01:22:05.261
The things they
don't report is what

01:22:05.379 --> 01:22:06.471
happened under
cross-examination

01:22:06.547 --> 01:22:08.675
when the person who
made the accusation

01:22:08.757 --> 01:22:10.397
couldn't remember
anything about the room.

01:22:10.467 --> 01:22:12.936
Couldn't remember if the
doctor was a man or a woman.

01:22:13.011 --> 01:22:14.684
Couldn't remember if they
had a lab coat on or not.

01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:17.061
Couldn't remember if they had a
clipboard. Couldn't remember anything.

01:22:17.141 --> 01:22:19.940
No facts, no figures, no evidence.
Just a mouth.

01:22:20.018 --> 01:22:21.770
Aren't you sick of it?

01:22:21.854 --> 01:22:23.777
Beyond the media,
Lance had many supporters

01:22:23.856 --> 01:22:25.233
who helped him sustain the myth.

01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:27.868
One of those was
Stephanie McIlvain.

01:22:28.694 --> 01:22:31.743
She worked for Oakley,
one of Armstrong's sponsors.

01:22:31.822 --> 01:22:34.792
She had also been
in the hospital room.

01:22:34.867 --> 01:22:36.995
According to Betsy,
in their conversations,

01:22:37.119 --> 01:22:39.213
Stephanie
confirmed Betsy's story.

01:22:39.746 --> 01:22:42.875
But in Stephanie's deposition,
she took Lance's side.

01:22:42.958 --> 01:22:44.460
Were you ever in a hospital room

01:22:44.543 --> 01:22:46.841
or other part of the hospital
with Mr. Armstrong,

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:50.049
where he said anything about
performance-enhancing drugs?

01:22:50.132 --> 01:22:51.384
No.

01:22:51.467 --> 01:22:53.561
After the deposition,
she left a message

01:22:53.635 --> 01:22:55.137
on Betsy's answering machine.

01:22:56.388 --> 01:22:58.982
I HOPE SOMEBODY BREAKS
A BASEBALL BAT OVER YOUR HEAD

01:22:59.057 --> 01:23:03.858
BUT I ALSO HOPE THAT ONE DAY YOU
HAVE ADVERSITY IN YOUR LIFE

01:23:03.937 --> 01:23:08.864
AND YOU HAVE SOME TYPE OF TRAGEDY
THAT WILL HIT YOUR FAMILY

01:23:08.942 --> 01:23:12.321
AND MAKE YOU REALIZE
WHAT LIFE IS ABOUT

01:23:12.404 --> 01:23:16.830
OTHER THAN GOING AFTER PEOPLE
THAT YOU ACTUALLY HATE.

01:23:16.909 --> 01:23:19.708
IT'S PATHETIC BETSY.

01:23:19.828 --> 01:23:22.627
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
A BETTER PERSON THAN THAT.

01:23:22.706 --> 01:23:25.505
I AM SO SADDENED
THAT YOU'RE NOT.

01:23:25.584 --> 01:23:27.211
YOU ARE SUCH A SHALLOW

01:23:27.294 --> 01:23:28.671
BITCH!

01:23:28.921 --> 01:23:33.347
It didn't matter if the
world thought I was a liar,

01:23:33.425 --> 01:23:36.975
as long as the people close to
me knew I was telling the truth.

01:23:37.054 --> 01:23:42.527
However, when it affected Frankie's
ability to work in the sport,

01:23:42.601 --> 01:23:44.774
that's when I put my
foot down and I said,

01:23:44.978 --> 01:23:47.948
"I'm going to be obsessed with
getting the truth out there."

01:23:48.023 --> 01:23:51.778
This is the first time
Andreu has spoken about it on television.

01:23:51.944 --> 01:23:55.039
He replied, "Growth hormone,

01:23:55.113 --> 01:24:00.540
"steroids, testosterone,
EPO, cortisone."

01:24:00.619 --> 01:24:02.496
From the moment
Betsy started speaking out,

01:24:02.579 --> 01:24:06.880
Frankie was confronted by an
old teammate, George Hincapie.

01:24:07.459 --> 01:24:09.132
Frankie was my mentor,

01:24:09.211 --> 01:24:13.387
and the first time I ever saw dope
was in Frankie's refrigerator.

01:24:13.465 --> 01:24:15.706
And that's when I realized,
"Well, fuck, I have to dope."

01:24:16.426 --> 01:24:17.747
So for me,
that really bothered me

01:24:17.844 --> 01:24:19.124
that all of a sudden he changed,

01:24:19.179 --> 01:24:21.477
and he wasn't racing anymore and
said, "Well, Lance is doping."

01:24:21.557 --> 01:24:24.106
Well, I mean,
you taught me how to dope.

01:24:24.184 --> 01:24:27.609
How could you stand by when you
know that you did what you did?

01:24:28.605 --> 01:24:29.731
Lance never sat there and said,

01:24:29.815 --> 01:24:31.738
"You're gonna dope or you're
out or I'm firing you."

01:24:31.817 --> 01:24:34.741
That's just not true, and they made
it seem like that was the case.

01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:37.289
You're either on his side,
or you're off his side.

01:24:37.364 --> 01:24:38.764
If you crossed him,
you were doomed.

01:24:38.824 --> 01:24:42.749
You were thrown out
very quickly, cast aside,

01:24:42.828 --> 01:24:44.296
and then you could
sit there waiting

01:24:44.413 --> 01:24:45.915
for the revenge to
be sent upon you.

01:24:45.998 --> 01:24:51.095
That desire to bully.
That desire to crush people.

01:24:51.169 --> 01:24:53.342
He tried to wreck their lives.

01:24:53.463 --> 01:24:56.012
Armstrong used his fame
to undermine the credibility

01:24:56.174 --> 01:24:58.677
of his critics like Greg LeMond.

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:03.436
Greg, who I know has serious
drinking and drug problems,

01:25:03.515 --> 01:25:06.064
was clearly intoxicated.

01:25:06.226 --> 01:25:07.273
Hey, Emma!

01:25:07.352 --> 01:25:10.481
Emma O'Reilly, part of
Postal's team support staff,

01:25:10.564 --> 01:25:12.987
had helped Lance
hide his doping.

01:25:13.066 --> 01:25:15.910
After she left the team,
she told a reporter about it.

01:25:15.986 --> 01:25:17.203
Emma.

01:25:17.696 --> 01:25:20.916
Afraid that we were
gonna out her as a,

01:25:20.991 --> 01:25:22.391
you know,
all these things she said,

01:25:22.534 --> 01:25:23.974
as a whore or whatever.
I don't know.

01:25:24.536 --> 01:25:27.255
Lance's lawyers pressured
Emma to change her tune,

01:25:27.331 --> 01:25:30.631
but she was determined to tell the
truth and refused to back down.

01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:34.304
Lance's counsel sued for libel
in Britain and France.

01:25:34.379 --> 01:25:38.475
One of his many modus
operandi was "just sue."

01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:41.599
The financial drain, the emotional
drain, the mental drain...

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:44.348
It's a pretty effective legal
strategy when you think about it.

01:25:44.431 --> 01:25:46.149
It's like,
"I've got deeper pockets,

01:25:46.224 --> 01:25:48.397
"and I can fight this war of
attrition and you can't."

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:51.655
It just built one upon another,

01:25:51.730 --> 01:25:54.358
and the denials
became more defiant,

01:25:54.483 --> 01:25:57.157
and the arguments
became more heated.

01:25:57.944 --> 01:25:59.787
I should have just backed away.

01:26:01.073 --> 01:26:05.954
In 2004, Armstrong launched
lawsuits over L.A. Confidentiel,

01:26:06.036 --> 01:26:08.960
the first book to air
doping charges against him.

01:26:09.039 --> 01:26:11.337
He stopped its
publication in America,

01:26:11.416 --> 01:26:15.466
forced an apology and won a
judgment worth $1.5 million

01:26:15.545 --> 01:26:18.890
that tarnished the reputation
of the co-author, David Walsh.

01:26:19.216 --> 01:26:22.470
How can this guy dope
so much and not get caught?

01:26:22.761 --> 01:26:25.105
That tells us about
how cycling was run.

01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:28.901
It tells us about
the attitudes of the UCI,

01:26:28.975 --> 01:26:31.023
which is the world
governing body for cycling.

01:26:31.269 --> 01:26:36.116
Its president for most of the Lance
Armstrong years was Hein Verbruggen.

01:26:36.441 --> 01:26:40.162
Hein Verbruggen and Lance Armstrong
have always been friends.

01:26:41.071 --> 01:26:43.665
The UCI denies that
they ever covered up

01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:45.868
a drug test for Lance Armstrong,

01:26:45.951 --> 01:26:47.203
but they do say

01:26:47.285 --> 01:26:52.462
that when Lance and other top riders
tested with suspicious levels,

01:26:52.624 --> 01:26:56.003
they would go and talk to those
riders and they would say,

01:26:56.086 --> 01:26:58.509
"Listen, you're flying
a little too close to the sun.

01:26:58.588 --> 01:27:00.056
"We're going to be watching you.

01:27:00.173 --> 01:27:01.641
"You better stop
what you're doing."

01:27:02.509 --> 01:27:04.932
There were dozens, if not
hundreds, of those conversations

01:27:05.011 --> 01:27:08.140
going, "Hey, this is close."

01:27:12.102 --> 01:27:14.525
But the truth is that
everybody was making money.

01:27:14.604 --> 01:27:15.856
Everybody.

01:27:16.189 --> 01:27:18.817
And I mean everybody.

01:27:19.943 --> 01:27:23.698
Trek Bicycles, in 1998,
does $100 million in revenue.

01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:25.282
Now they're pushing a billion.

01:27:25.741 --> 01:27:28.915
We all made money. Some made
a lot more than others.

01:27:29.953 --> 01:27:32.172
Some of
Verbruggen's money was managed

01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:34.583
in an appearance of
conflict of interest

01:27:34.833 --> 01:27:37.006
by an investment
firm owned by the man

01:27:37.127 --> 01:27:39.221
who bank-rolled
Armstrong's team.

01:27:40.046 --> 01:27:43.425
As head of the UCI, Verbruggen
knew how much money and popularity

01:27:43.508 --> 01:27:45.260
Lance had brought to the sport.

01:27:45.844 --> 01:27:49.269
So when L'Equipe published
evidence of doping by Armstrong,

01:27:49.347 --> 01:27:51.349
cycling had a problem.

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:55.275
It was in his interest for the
sport to continue to grow

01:27:55.353 --> 01:27:57.481
and grow controversy-free.

01:27:57.898 --> 01:27:59.445
A thing we weren't very good at.

01:28:00.525 --> 01:28:04.996
I mean, it was controversies every year.
Every year. Big ones.

01:28:06.364 --> 01:28:08.708
Verbruggen asked an
acquaintance, Emile Vrijman,

01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:11.703
to conduct an investigation
into the newspaper allegations.

01:28:13.246 --> 01:28:15.044
In the conversations
with Hein Verbruggen,

01:28:15.165 --> 01:28:16.917
clearly was
the focus point on saying

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:18.640
find out what kind of
research did they do

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:22.890
is this a positive test
according to our definitions

01:28:22.964 --> 01:28:25.638
and if yes, should we
do something about it.

01:28:26.593 --> 01:28:30.393
Oddly, the Vrijman Report didn't
focus on whether Lance had doped.

01:28:30.472 --> 01:28:33.726
Instead, it looked at technical
details, lab protocols,

01:28:33.892 --> 01:28:36.395
and attacked
the World Anti-Doping Agency.

01:28:36.561 --> 01:28:40.031
Without examining samples for
drug use, the report concluded

01:28:40.106 --> 01:28:42.825
that Lance was
completely exonerated.

01:28:42.901 --> 01:28:45.199
The 130-page
Vrijman Report that came out,

01:28:45.278 --> 01:28:46.639
he was
the independent investigator

01:28:46.738 --> 01:28:49.161
hired by our
international federation,

01:28:49.366 --> 01:28:51.243
it outlined,
very clearly, what happened.

01:28:52.702 --> 01:28:56.127
What Lance didn't say then,
but what he told me years later,

01:28:56.206 --> 01:28:58.880
was that he and his team
had input on the report

01:28:58.959 --> 01:29:01.178
and were delighted
with the result.

01:29:01.253 --> 01:29:04.757
Based on further talks with
Lance, I had more questions.

01:29:05.549 --> 01:29:07.927
Did you or your
law firm receive any payments

01:29:08.009 --> 01:29:10.182
from Lance Armstrong
or his representatives?

01:29:10.428 --> 01:29:13.477
Not at all.
As far as I know, not at all.

01:29:13.598 --> 01:29:16.477
Vrijman's denial
led me to an odd coincidence.

01:29:17.352 --> 01:29:20.401
In 2007,
the UCI paid the final bill

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:23.450
for the report,
approximately $100,000.

01:29:23.942 --> 01:29:27.287
Earlier that year, Lance had
made a donation to the UCI.

01:29:27.445 --> 01:29:30.244
The amount? $100,000.

01:29:30.323 --> 01:29:32.451
The reason, says the UCI,

01:29:32.659 --> 01:29:36.789
to pay for a blood-testing
machine purchased in 2005.

01:29:39.291 --> 01:29:41.885
Listen, nobody believes in
doping controls more than me.

01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:44.054
I've submitted to all of them,

01:29:44.129 --> 01:29:46.427
whether in competition
or out of competition.

01:29:53.597 --> 01:29:56.316
On the road, Lance
was able to protect his lie

01:29:56.433 --> 01:29:59.107
by enforcing
the power of omerté,

01:29:59.185 --> 01:30:02.234
a code of silence
among riders about doping.

01:30:03.815 --> 01:30:06.489
During the 2004 Tour

01:30:06.568 --> 01:30:08.991
Lance Armstrong very publicly
humiliated me.

01:30:09.195 --> 01:30:12.449
What happened was that
Filippo Simeoni tried to attack

01:30:12.532 --> 01:30:16.082
to join the six-man breakaway that had
built up a bit of a lead on the peloton.

01:30:16.161 --> 01:30:18.129
The trouble is that Lance
doesn't like Simeoni,

01:30:18.204 --> 01:30:20.332
who is actually
suing him for slander in Italy

01:30:20.498 --> 01:30:22.592
after Armstrong
called him a liar.

01:30:23.168 --> 01:30:25.341
Was that all about Ferrari?

01:30:25.587 --> 01:30:28.181
Simeoni had testified
at a trial against Ferrari,

01:30:28.465 --> 01:30:30.433
and Lance was working
with Michele Ferrari

01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:32.473
and considered
Ferrari a good friend.

01:30:32.552 --> 01:30:35.146
So, in the race,
Simeoni attacked,

01:30:35.263 --> 01:30:37.857
and Lance,
who had the yellow jersey on,

01:30:37.974 --> 01:30:40.272
followed the move,
which is unheard of,

01:30:40.352 --> 01:30:42.952
'cause normally you just let your
team do all the chasing for you.

01:30:43.063 --> 01:30:46.317
But he went up to Simeoni, and
Simeoni was trying to win the stage,

01:30:46.399 --> 01:30:48.993
and, pretty much,
Lance said, "No way."

01:30:49.069 --> 01:30:50.787
It was kind of
wrong of him to do that,

01:30:50.904 --> 01:30:52.656
but the peloton
was happy about it

01:30:52.781 --> 01:30:56.126
because they didn't appreciate what
Simeoni was doing at that point.

01:30:56.201 --> 01:30:57.748
You mean sort of
outing the secret?

01:30:57.827 --> 01:30:58.953
Yeah, outing the secret.

01:30:59.037 --> 01:31:00.757
They were all probably
doing the same thing.

01:31:01.081 --> 01:31:03.675
The result was that
Simeoni returned to the field

01:31:03.917 --> 01:31:05.669
having apparently
been told by Lance

01:31:05.794 --> 01:31:07.546
to sit at the back and shut up.

01:31:07.629 --> 01:31:10.678
That's the kind of authority
the patron of the peloton has,

01:31:10.757 --> 01:31:12.725
and Lance is not
afraid to wield it.

01:31:13.093 --> 01:31:15.016
Lance,
can I ask just what went on

01:31:15.136 --> 01:31:17.013
between you and
Simeoni today in the race?

01:31:17.931 --> 01:31:19.604
I was just following the wheels.

01:31:21.226 --> 01:31:23.274
He can be
revengeful and vindictive,

01:31:23.353 --> 01:31:25.776
but then at the same time, very,
very loyal and supportive,

01:31:25.855 --> 01:31:27.277
and I've been on both sides.

01:31:27.774 --> 01:31:29.902
What do you expect at the
finish for yourself?

01:31:32.028 --> 01:31:34.076
Honestly, I don't know.

01:31:35.156 --> 01:31:39.627
If Cancellara's dropped, and the
climb isn't as hard as we all think

01:31:39.703 --> 01:31:43.674
and I stay with the leaders,
then I can take the jersey.

01:31:44.708 --> 01:31:46.631
And what would that mean to you?

01:31:46.751 --> 01:31:48.719
It'd be great.
It'd be a trip.

01:33:08.166 --> 01:33:11.170
After the first week,
the Tour moved to the Pyrenees.

01:33:11.669 --> 01:33:14.013
Mountain stages are where the
best riders make their moves

01:33:14.214 --> 01:33:16.512
and where Lance had
dominated in the past.

01:33:17.509 --> 01:33:21.810
But unlike previous Tours, Lance
didn't look like he was in control.

01:33:22.013 --> 01:33:24.482
He sure rode like he was clean.

01:33:24.682 --> 01:33:26.980
He was struggling physically.

01:33:27.352 --> 01:33:30.401
He looked beaten for
a lot of those stages.

01:33:32.941 --> 01:33:34.943
He was not
anywhere close to as fast

01:33:35.026 --> 01:33:37.575
as where he was in 2001 or '99,

01:33:37.654 --> 01:33:39.531
but he was also
almost 40 years old.

01:33:39.614 --> 01:33:43.790
Is it conceivable to think
that he was racing clean in 2009?

01:33:43.868 --> 01:33:47.418
It's possible. You know, he
knows the answer to that.

01:33:47.789 --> 01:33:51.339
Not that the sport was harder,
but I found it harder.

01:33:51.417 --> 01:33:55.763
And I don't know
if it was being older,

01:33:55.839 --> 01:33:58.467
or if it was being clean,
or if it was...

01:33:59.592 --> 01:34:03.142
I want to believe that the
rest of the group was clean in '09.

01:34:03.221 --> 01:34:04.689
I can't speak for them,

01:34:04.764 --> 01:34:08.564
but I like to believe that
we all were basically clean.

01:34:24.242 --> 01:34:26.165
Gibney, we gotta win
this fucking Tour de France.

01:34:26.244 --> 01:34:28.918
Yeah, I'm counting
on you for the movie.

01:34:29.038 --> 01:34:30.335
This is all about me.

01:34:30.415 --> 01:34:33.089
Trust me, this will not
be the same if I don't.

01:34:36.129 --> 01:34:38.348
Gonna be hard.
Harder than I thought.

01:34:38.464 --> 01:34:40.683
Harder than I
thought a week ago.

01:34:48.224 --> 01:34:50.602
Lance had lost ground, but
he was still close to the lead

01:34:50.685 --> 01:34:53.564
and only two seconds
behind his rival, Contador,

01:34:53.646 --> 01:34:55.319
going into the biggest climb
of the Tour.

01:34:56.482 --> 01:34:59.076
I figured that if Lance was gonna
manage his mythic comeback,

01:34:59.152 --> 01:35:01.246
he would have to
beat Contador here.

01:35:01.321 --> 01:35:03.289
But would that be
enough to put an end

01:35:03.364 --> 01:35:05.583
to all the questions
about the past?

01:35:08.244 --> 01:35:10.622
Today is a very important day.

01:35:11.039 --> 01:35:12.962
We have two weeks
of racing behind us.

01:35:13.082 --> 01:35:14.959
We have one very
hard week ahead of us.

01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:19.009
And today could be a day
where a lot of things change.

01:35:22.175 --> 01:35:27.773
You know, everybody's always talking
about Alberto, Lance, Lance, Alberto.

01:35:28.139 --> 01:35:30.312
We are here to win
the Tour de France.

01:35:30.558 --> 01:35:32.936
Of course, both of
them are feeling good,

01:35:33.061 --> 01:35:35.439
and both of them
want to try to win.

01:35:37.106 --> 01:35:40.485
The start of that day,
I'd been hanging out at the bus

01:35:40.568 --> 01:35:42.491
and Lance came out of the bus.

01:35:42.654 --> 01:35:44.656
And I said, "Pretty big day."

01:35:44.739 --> 01:35:47.099
And he said, "Yeah, this one's
for all the fucking marbles."

01:35:57.752 --> 01:36:01.848
Just before the steepest
climb, Contador looked back at Lance.

01:36:01.923 --> 01:36:05.848
Was that teamwork?
Or a last "fuck you"?

01:36:33.997 --> 01:36:36.170
But who's
gonna stop Contador now?

01:36:36.249 --> 01:36:39.469
Well, I don't think anybody can stop
him, because the gap is opening.

01:36:39.544 --> 01:36:43.094
Twenty-three seconds to Schleck,
42 seconds to Armstrong,

01:36:43.172 --> 01:36:46.267
a minute,
22 to the yellow jersey.

01:37:30.678 --> 01:37:33.272
Alberto Contador
now is establishing himself

01:37:33.389 --> 01:37:35.892
as the leader of
the Astana team.

01:37:35.975 --> 01:37:37.852
And, boy, when you see him
climb like this,

01:37:37.935 --> 01:37:39.778
who else could there be?

01:37:43.191 --> 01:37:46.445
There's the pistol shot. Alberto
Contador's over the line.

01:37:46.527 --> 01:37:49.406
He's the next maillot jaune
of the Tour de France.

01:37:49.489 --> 01:37:51.082
Very fast at the
bottom of the climb.

01:37:51.199 --> 01:37:52.746
Contador went once
and you went after him.

01:37:52.825 --> 01:37:55.145
And the second time he went,
what were your thoughts there?

01:37:55.370 --> 01:37:58.169
He showed he's the best rider
in the race, certainly the best climber.

01:37:58.247 --> 01:38:01.217
When everybody's on the limit and
then you can accelerate again,

01:38:01.292 --> 01:38:02.464
I've been there, and it's...

01:38:03.044 --> 01:38:05.593
Do you think your chances for
winning the Tour now are over?

01:38:06.172 --> 01:38:07.173
Um...

01:38:07.632 --> 01:38:10.010
Yeah. It'll be hard.

01:38:10.093 --> 01:38:12.391
You know, a day like this
really shows who's the best,

01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:17.897
and I wasn't on par with what's
required to win the Tour, so,

01:38:17.975 --> 01:38:20.398
I mean, for me,
that's the reality.

01:38:20.478 --> 01:38:24.233
That's not
devastating news or anything.

01:38:25.525 --> 01:38:27.198
But are you disappointed with...

01:38:27.276 --> 01:38:29.779
The Lance Armstrong
I know always is a fighter,

01:38:29.904 --> 01:38:32.157
always is one that
is in attack mode.

01:38:32.490 --> 01:38:35.585
And when I asked him that
question, he was different.

01:38:36.244 --> 01:38:38.087
I think there was
a lot of doubt in his head

01:38:38.162 --> 01:38:40.540
on what he was gonna be able
to accomplish at that Tour.

01:38:41.666 --> 01:38:43.543
When Frankie was talking to him,

01:38:43.626 --> 01:38:47.096
it was such an honest exchange
between those two guys.

01:38:47.171 --> 01:38:48.468
When he was looking at this guy,

01:38:48.548 --> 01:38:52.223
who had been his friend for
years as well as his teammate,

01:38:52.301 --> 01:38:53.974
and who had doped,

01:38:54.053 --> 01:38:58.524
and he seemed to be admitting to
Frankie more so than to the camera

01:38:58.599 --> 01:39:01.352
that, "I just don't have it.
I'm not good enough."

01:39:01.978 --> 01:39:05.858
He had lost time, and he showed
himself to be the weaker rider.

01:39:17.535 --> 01:39:19.958
I don't have that punch that
I used to have. GIBNEY: Uh-huh.

01:39:28.045 --> 01:39:29.467
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:39:30.590 --> 01:39:32.388
No, but I mean, I...

01:39:35.052 --> 01:39:37.100
I guess I'm... You know...

01:39:38.514 --> 01:39:39.936
In terms of...

01:39:40.016 --> 01:39:41.643
I know. It fucked
up your documentary.

01:39:41.726 --> 01:39:45.230
No, no. No. Nothing fucks
up my documentary.

01:39:47.523 --> 01:39:48.740
I'm sorry.

01:39:58.993 --> 01:40:01.997
I don't think Lance's
apology was just banter.

01:40:02.079 --> 01:40:03.501
Part of it was real.

01:40:03.581 --> 01:40:06.755
Saying he was sorry he couldn't
deliver, one more time,

01:40:06.834 --> 01:40:10.384
the perfect fairy tale that
everyone had come to expect.

01:40:12.173 --> 01:40:15.848
Going forward, he was looking
for a way to salvage things.

01:40:15.927 --> 01:40:18.055
What meaning would
his comeback have

01:40:18.179 --> 01:40:20.273
if he couldn't
finish in the top three?

01:40:20.348 --> 01:40:22.350
Now in second,
he braced for attacks

01:40:22.433 --> 01:40:24.902
from Garmin's Bradley Wiggins
and the Schleck brothers,

01:40:24.977 --> 01:40:27.275
all determined to
push him off the podium.

01:40:44.747 --> 01:40:47.045
Johan knew that
Lance was not at his best.

01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:49.878
So he pursued
a delicate strategy,

01:40:49.961 --> 01:40:52.214
protecting
Contador's yellow jersey

01:40:52.296 --> 01:40:55.220
and a spot on
the podium for his old friend.

01:40:56.050 --> 01:40:58.223
Without the
podium, the comeback,

01:40:58.302 --> 01:41:01.476
it's not just a wash,
but it's a disaster for him.

01:41:05.893 --> 01:41:09.648
Remember that to win the Tour
you don't have to attack.

01:41:09.730 --> 01:41:14.236
Only if you know you can leave
everyone, then you can go.

01:41:15.152 --> 01:41:17.325
Johan didn't want
Contador to attack,

01:41:17.405 --> 01:41:19.908
because he might push the
Schlecks to a faster pace

01:41:19.991 --> 01:41:21.312
than they would
ride on their own.

01:41:22.159 --> 01:41:26.164
If they raced ahead, that could
cost Lance a spot on the podium.

01:41:29.083 --> 01:41:30.644
What's happening here?
Contador's moved.

01:41:30.668 --> 01:41:31.840
He's decided to go it alone.

01:41:31.919 --> 01:41:33.842
Now can there be
a reaction from Andy

01:41:34.005 --> 01:41:35.928
after all the work
that man has done?

01:41:36.007 --> 01:41:37.850
Contador is now
going for the top.

01:41:41.137 --> 01:41:44.812
He's allowed himself just
under two kilometers to the summit,

01:41:44.890 --> 01:41:46.267
and he's going for the win.

01:41:46.350 --> 01:41:48.899
Contador testing the waters
here this afternoon,

01:41:48.978 --> 01:41:51.401
but he hasn't got the gap
on the two Schleck brothers.

01:41:51.731 --> 01:41:54.735
Stop, stop Alberto,
they're on you.

01:41:54.817 --> 01:41:56.239
And it was
a terrific acceleration,

01:41:56.319 --> 01:41:58.037
but that's what
this man is famous for,

01:41:58.195 --> 01:42:00.038
is the acceleration on the mountains.

01:42:00.114 --> 01:42:02.617
There was no need for that shit!

01:42:25.806 --> 01:42:26.807
Shit!

01:42:28.851 --> 01:42:31.445
Lance took dangerous
chances on the descent.

01:42:31.729 --> 01:42:34.653
It was his only chance
to get back in the game.

01:42:35.816 --> 01:42:37.318
By following Contador's attack,

01:42:37.401 --> 01:42:40.905
the Schleck brothers were now
second and third behind Contador.

01:42:40.988 --> 01:42:43.491
Lance was in fourth,
off the podium.

01:42:45.409 --> 01:42:47.503
I wondered what
words were exchanged

01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:48.941
between Contador
and the Schlecks.

01:42:50.039 --> 01:42:53.168
He doesn't care, he's going
all alone on the podium,

01:42:53.250 --> 01:42:56.379
not with the team.

01:42:57.880 --> 01:42:59.848
I don't blame Contador one bit.

01:42:59.924 --> 01:43:03.098
He didn't trust anybody on that
team, and he wanted to make sure

01:43:03.177 --> 01:43:05.430
that he had that yellow jersey
firmly on his shoulders.

01:43:05.513 --> 01:43:06.594
He learned this from Lance.

01:43:06.597 --> 01:43:08.019
When you have a chance
to seize the yellow jersey

01:43:08.099 --> 01:43:10.227
and take time out of your
opponents, you do it.

01:43:10.309 --> 01:43:12.357
Alberto was doing
textbook Lance Armstrong.

01:43:12.436 --> 01:43:14.109
It just backfired on Lance.

01:43:18.401 --> 01:43:21.029
This guy is really unbelievable

01:43:21.112 --> 01:43:23.786
Why did he have to attack?

01:43:28.953 --> 01:43:31.081
There was still one
more mountain to climb,

01:43:31.163 --> 01:43:33.416
cycling's mythic Mont Ventoux.

01:43:34.625 --> 01:43:38.596
If Lance didn't do well here, his
whole comeback would backfire.

01:43:39.672 --> 01:43:43.927
Some people would say he lost precisely
because he couldn't win clean.

01:43:44.009 --> 01:43:45.352
It was a tough challenge.

01:43:45.428 --> 01:43:48.682
In years past,
Lance had never won Ventoux.

01:43:48.764 --> 01:43:52.940
I've had such a long history
with that fucking mountain.

01:43:54.478 --> 01:43:56.731
Lance believed that
a strong showing here

01:43:56.814 --> 01:44:00.569
might somehow extinguish the
doubts that haunted his legacy.

01:44:07.867 --> 01:44:11.292
Following a time trial, Contador
was still safely in the lead,

01:44:11.370 --> 01:44:13.793
but Lance had clawed his way
back to third place,

01:44:13.873 --> 01:44:16.422
just a few seconds ahead
of Wiggins and Frank Schleck

01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:19.379
and just over
a minute behind Andy Schleck.

01:44:26.719 --> 01:44:29.347
The Schlecks seemed determined
to break Armstrong's will

01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:30.727
by attacking him
again and again.

01:44:32.057 --> 01:44:34.901
But this time, Armstrong
would not be dropped.

01:44:34.977 --> 01:44:36.524
Look at the face
of Armstrong there.

01:44:36.604 --> 01:44:39.404
He's just telling Frank, "You ain't
going nowhere this afternoon, mate,

01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:42.865
"because I'm going to stick
all over your back wheel."

01:44:59.126 --> 01:45:00.628
Ventoux opens up,

01:45:00.711 --> 01:45:03.385
and you could see a very small
group that included him.

01:45:04.924 --> 01:45:07.518
Against every possible odd,

01:45:07.593 --> 01:45:09.186
he had managed to
stay with that group

01:45:09.303 --> 01:45:10.896
and he was not gonna lose time.

01:45:11.472 --> 01:45:13.566
I was like, "He's gonna do it!
I can't believe it!" You know?

01:45:13.849 --> 01:45:15.567
The guy is amazing.

01:45:18.270 --> 01:45:22.241
To see him not just hanging
on, but having some aggression,

01:45:22.817 --> 01:45:26.572
not just surviving,
but asserting,

01:45:26.862 --> 01:45:30.116
was the most
dramatic moment of the Tour.

01:45:30.199 --> 01:45:32.201
He wasn't gonna win. He was
doing it for some other reason,

01:45:32.284 --> 01:45:35.003
some reason that
was unfamiliar to him.

01:45:36.455 --> 01:45:37.581
I was caught up, too.

01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:40.759
At that moment,
on that fucking mountain,

01:45:40.835 --> 01:45:43.384
I was just a fan,
rooting for Lance.

01:45:49.593 --> 01:45:51.687
Just before the finish,
Wiggins cracked,

01:45:51.762 --> 01:45:53.981
but Lance found another gear.

01:45:54.056 --> 01:45:56.980
He pedaled on with
Contador and the Schlecks.

01:46:07.403 --> 01:46:08.825
It was a good day.

01:46:08.904 --> 01:46:12.704
I thought I'd be fine, but I
felt better than I expected.

01:46:12.783 --> 01:46:14.706
Right.
Which was good.

01:46:15.286 --> 01:46:17.209
Although I came in
here and wanted to win

01:46:17.288 --> 01:46:20.508
and thought I could win,
thought I could be close,

01:46:22.334 --> 01:46:23.881
that's not going to happen.

01:46:23.961 --> 01:46:25.053
I'm gonna get third.

01:46:25.254 --> 01:46:29.885
I can stand on the third step
and still say that I have won.

01:46:29.967 --> 01:46:33.392
And I've won because of all of
the reasons I wanted to do this.

01:46:33.470 --> 01:46:35.598
My foundation has benefited.

01:46:35.681 --> 01:46:38.059
Cancer survivors and their
families all over the world

01:46:38.142 --> 01:46:40.486
have benefited because of this.

01:46:41.478 --> 01:46:43.446
I think I've
answered a lot of questions

01:46:43.564 --> 01:46:45.487
about the performances
in the past.

01:46:45.566 --> 01:46:46.738
Right.

01:46:46.817 --> 01:46:47.818
Um...

01:46:48.986 --> 01:46:50.454
It was incredible.

01:46:50.529 --> 01:46:52.406
No sooner was the race over

01:46:52.489 --> 01:46:55.413
than Lance was busy writing
a new ending to his story,

01:46:55.492 --> 01:46:57.335
one that even
the French embraced.

01:46:59.163 --> 01:47:03.088
The headline in the paper that had
once trumpeted "The Armstrong Lie"

01:47:03.167 --> 01:47:05.044
now sang a different tune.

01:47:05.127 --> 01:47:08.848
"Chapeau, le Texan."
"Hats off to Armstrong."

01:47:10.341 --> 01:47:14.596
This was the perfect ending for the
original movie I started to make.

01:47:16.764 --> 01:47:17.856
But four years later,

01:47:18.474 --> 01:47:20.727
investigations
revealed something strange

01:47:20.809 --> 01:47:23.813
about Lance's
blood values in 2009.

01:47:23.896 --> 01:47:26.274
During the Tour, Lance
should have seen a decrease

01:47:26.357 --> 01:47:28.109
in the concentration
of his red blood cells.

01:47:29.234 --> 01:47:32.113
Instead, there was an increase
more than once.

01:47:32.196 --> 01:47:35.541
And just before Ventoux,
the day he saved his comeback.

01:47:37.201 --> 01:47:39.203
What happened there with Ventoux

01:47:39.370 --> 01:47:41.372
is kind of what
happened with his life.

01:47:41.455 --> 01:47:44.425
Just like when he was a kid
and he couldn't do it clean,

01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:47.424
there came a point in 2009
when he couldn't do it clean.

01:47:47.503 --> 01:47:50.882
And I think he'd made that
deal again before Ventoux.

01:47:52.049 --> 01:47:54.677
I know what I know,
and I know that it was clean.

01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:56.979
We finished the Ventoux.
It was a five or six hour day.

01:47:57.054 --> 01:47:58.431
It was hot.
It was hard, obviously.

01:47:59.014 --> 01:48:01.608
Immediately in the car,
down to the hotel

01:48:01.684 --> 01:48:05.314
and the French guy was there
to take the blood draw.

01:48:07.523 --> 01:48:10.993
I've never in my
career had blood taken

01:48:11.068 --> 01:48:13.992
at the end of a day, at the
end of a stage like that.

01:48:14.071 --> 01:48:15.163
It does not happen.

01:48:15.739 --> 01:48:16.740
Why?

01:48:17.533 --> 01:48:18.785
Because it's normal and natural

01:48:18.867 --> 01:48:20.665
that when the body goes
through stress like that,

01:48:20.744 --> 01:48:25.966
the body is obviously, if not very
dehydrated, extremely dehydrated.

01:48:26.875 --> 01:48:29.845
It's not what they
would call "steady state."

01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:33.515
And I think that's common
knowledge and common science.

01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:35.467
It's not a fair number.

01:48:36.301 --> 01:48:39.680
You know, he still
swears to me that he didn't.

01:48:39.763 --> 01:48:42.733
We've talked about
this and I tell him,

01:48:42.850 --> 01:48:45.774
"That's really
a tough one to believe."

01:48:51.984 --> 01:48:54.203
it was tough for
me to believe, too,

01:48:54.319 --> 01:48:56.538
since Lance had
lied to me so often.

01:48:56.613 --> 01:49:00.208
But he was adamant he
did not dope in 2009.

01:49:01.368 --> 01:49:03.712
Why was Lance
hanging on to this one?

01:49:03.787 --> 01:49:06.381
Could it possibly be true?

01:49:06.457 --> 01:49:09.802
Or was the comeback a new lie
to replace the old one?

01:49:10.961 --> 01:49:14.556
Armstrong was in
a position of saying,

01:49:14.631 --> 01:49:15.928
"Look, I'm gonna do
what I did in '99.

01:49:16.008 --> 01:49:17.528
"I'm gonna come in
in the wake of this.

01:49:17.551 --> 01:49:20.805
"I'm gonna clean up my name. I'm gonna
prove that I'm doing it clean."

01:49:22.514 --> 01:49:26.189
it's like a bank robber breaking
back into the bank again

01:49:26.268 --> 01:49:27.815
with everyone watching,

01:49:28.145 --> 01:49:29.466
feeling he would
get away with it.

01:49:29.563 --> 01:49:30.860
Feeling sure he
would get away with it.

01:49:31.023 --> 01:49:33.071
Lance Armstrong!

01:49:44.828 --> 01:49:47.172
Maybe this is why
they came after you.

01:49:47.247 --> 01:49:51.753
It's almost like you were daring
them to look under the hood.

01:49:51.835 --> 01:49:52.961
And they did.

01:49:57.341 --> 01:50:00.311
We now know that the
comeback was not a new beginning,

01:50:00.385 --> 01:50:02.433
but the beginning of the end.

01:50:02.513 --> 01:50:04.982
Yet at the time,
in the fading sun of Paris,

01:50:05.057 --> 01:50:08.812
Lance imagined the start of a new
chapter to his mythic story.

01:50:11.105 --> 01:50:12.778
And I'll be back next year.

01:50:15.776 --> 01:50:17.699
And then maybe we'll really win.

01:50:27.746 --> 01:50:30.340
In 2010, Lance did not win.

01:50:30.541 --> 01:50:32.214
He finished 23rd.

01:50:33.043 --> 01:50:35.011
Contador won
the race and was busted

01:50:35.129 --> 01:50:37.052
for violating
doping regulations.

01:50:39.299 --> 01:50:42.098
Did you see Lance Armstrong using
performance-enhancing drugs?

01:50:42.177 --> 01:50:43.520
I had, yeah.

01:50:43.595 --> 01:50:46.439
Armstrong's comeback brought
all of his enemies out of the woodwork.

01:50:47.057 --> 01:50:50.561
The first to come forward was
Lance's old teammate Floyd Landis.

01:50:50.853 --> 01:50:52.981
Yes. I saw Lance
Armstrong using drugs.

01:50:53.063 --> 01:50:54.583
I'd remind everybody
that this is a man

01:50:54.731 --> 01:50:56.233
that's been under
oath several times

01:50:56.316 --> 01:50:57.488
and had a very
different version.

01:50:57.568 --> 01:51:00.572
This is a man that
wrote a book for profit

01:51:01.196 --> 01:51:02.493
that had a completely
different version.

01:51:02.573 --> 01:51:05.292
If you said, "Give me one
word to sum this all up."

01:51:05.367 --> 01:51:06.664
Credibility.

01:51:06.743 --> 01:51:08.791
And there's...

01:51:08.871 --> 01:51:11.420
Floyd lost his
credibility a long time ago.

01:51:11.498 --> 01:51:15.548
In the hubbub over Landis,
a new name surfaced. Jeff Novitzky.

01:51:15.627 --> 01:51:17.379
He had prosecuted Barry Bonds.

01:51:17.462 --> 01:51:20.807
And now, as part of the FDA,
he was looking at Armstrong.

01:51:20.883 --> 01:51:23.102
Why would Novitzky
have anything to do

01:51:23.218 --> 01:51:25.391
with what
an athlete does in Europe?

01:51:25.470 --> 01:51:28.064
Armstrong's team was sponsored
by a branch of the federal government,

01:51:28.140 --> 01:51:29.141
the US Postal Service.

01:51:29.391 --> 01:51:32.190
It may have involved transfers
of controlled substances.

01:51:32.269 --> 01:51:34.021
It may have money laundering,
tax evasion,

01:51:34.104 --> 01:51:35.902
bribing foreign officials.

01:51:35.981 --> 01:51:37.233
.Doping is not illegal,

01:51:37.316 --> 01:51:40.035
but it's everything that
happens around doping

01:51:40.485 --> 01:51:45.241
that federal investigators wanted to
try and use to prosecute a crime.

01:51:45.490 --> 01:51:47.618
They started subpoenaing
cyclists, one by one.

01:51:48.202 --> 01:51:49.670
Assistants, wives.

01:51:50.662 --> 01:51:52.414
Jeff Novitzky called me.

01:51:52.789 --> 01:51:54.837
I said, "What's taken
you so long to call me?"

01:51:54.958 --> 01:51:58.087
"Well, I...
These things take time."

01:51:58.170 --> 01:51:59.843
I said, "Do you have a pen
and paper on hand?"

01:51:59.922 --> 01:52:02.141
And he said, "Yeah."
I said, "Let's get to work."

01:52:02.424 --> 01:52:04.017
As the investigation continued,

01:52:04.092 --> 01:52:07.767
another cyclist who had been
busted for doping, Tyler Hamilton,

01:52:07.846 --> 01:52:10.224
began to consider his options.

01:52:10.307 --> 01:52:13.186
Tyler had been
Lance's teammate in 1999.

01:52:13.977 --> 01:52:17.231
Tyler had been subpoenaed by the
grand jury, and he had a realization.

01:52:17.314 --> 01:52:19.362
Number one was, all this is gonna
come out one way or the other.

01:52:19.441 --> 01:52:21.318
The lie is too big.

01:52:21.401 --> 01:52:23.904
And the second thing was that
he wanted to tell his story.

01:52:23.987 --> 01:52:28.163
You saw Lance
Armstrong inject EPO?

01:52:28.825 --> 01:52:30.418
Yeah, like, we all did.

01:52:31.954 --> 01:52:36.334
And you see in that footage
Tyler's intense discomfort

01:52:36.416 --> 01:52:39.295
at facing the truth,
how hard that was.

01:52:39.378 --> 01:52:43.133
Omerté is very real, the code of
silence, which is why it took Tyler

01:52:43.215 --> 01:52:47.140
until he was talking to someone
who had a badge and a gun

01:52:47.219 --> 01:52:51.099
before he could fully start the
process of telling the truth.

01:52:51.306 --> 01:52:52.603
It seemed like the dam broke

01:52:52.683 --> 01:52:55.277
when suddenly somebody shows
up with a badge and a gun.

01:52:55.352 --> 01:52:56.774
Different ball game.

01:52:56.853 --> 01:52:59.322
That was never even
a thought in my mind

01:52:59.398 --> 01:53:01.651
going, "Well,
I'm just gonna go lie to

01:53:01.775 --> 01:53:03.994
"a federal prosecutor."
It's, like, no way.

01:53:05.821 --> 01:53:08.370
Early in 2012, an election year,

01:53:08.991 --> 01:53:11.665
the Department of Justice made
a surprising announcement.

01:53:11.743 --> 01:53:14.667
It would not pursue charges
against Armstrong.

01:53:14.746 --> 01:53:17.590
But USADA,
the US Anti-Doping Agency,

01:53:17.666 --> 01:53:19.668
continued with its
own investigation.

01:53:20.252 --> 01:53:23.847
He was one of the ringleaders
of this conspiracy

01:53:23.922 --> 01:53:26.550
that pulled off this grand heist

01:53:27.050 --> 01:53:30.020
using tens of
millions of taxpayer dollars,

01:53:30.095 --> 01:53:33.224
defrauded millions of sports
fans and his fellow competitors.

01:53:34.349 --> 01:53:37.023
Travis Tygart, with help
from government investigators,

01:53:37.102 --> 01:53:41.027
pried detailed testimony from
many of Lance's former teammates.

01:53:41.106 --> 01:53:44.827
Landis, Vaughters,
Hamilton, Andrea,

01:53:44.901 --> 01:53:46.995
and most damaging
of all to Lance,

01:53:47.112 --> 01:53:49.240
his loyal friend,
George Hincapie.

01:53:49.740 --> 01:53:53.586
They said, "Cooperate,
and you'll get six months."

01:53:54.619 --> 01:53:56.212
Right.
Yeah.

01:53:56.288 --> 01:53:58.040
And don't cooperate?

01:53:58.123 --> 01:54:00.251
And you're banned for life.

01:54:01.209 --> 01:54:04.588
Through his lawyers,
Lance attacked Tygart and USADA.

01:54:04.671 --> 01:54:06.173
USADA had said publicly

01:54:06.256 --> 01:54:09.385
that they had offered Lance the
same deal as everyone else.

01:54:09.468 --> 01:54:12.893
It's a claim Armstrong
and his lawyers deny.

01:54:13.013 --> 01:54:15.186
The message wasn't,
"Hey, we gotta give you something.

01:54:15.265 --> 01:54:18.144
"We gotta give you six months. We gotta
give you a penalty, a sanction."

01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:21.188
That did not happen.

01:54:21.271 --> 01:54:24.866
The call to me came and said,
"You're screwed.

01:54:24.941 --> 01:54:26.943
"Why don't you come on in here
and confess?"

01:54:27.486 --> 01:54:30.160
But I don't understand
then why go tell the world,

01:54:30.238 --> 01:54:32.286
every opportunity YOU get today

01:54:32.366 --> 01:54:33.583
that we offered
Lance the same deal

01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:34.940
that we offered everybody else?

01:54:35.118 --> 01:54:37.746
Just say, "We wanted him.
We got him.

01:54:38.747 --> 01:54:40.715
"Go dance on his grave."

01:54:43.377 --> 01:54:45.220
USADA banned Armstrong for life.

01:54:46.004 --> 01:54:48.803
His sponsors and
Livestrong cut all ties.

01:54:49.299 --> 01:54:52.678
The UCI stripped him of all
his Tour de France titles

01:54:52.761 --> 01:54:56.140
and his third-place
finish in 2009.

01:54:57.015 --> 01:54:59.609
Armstrong responded
with a defiant tweet.

01:55:05.649 --> 01:55:07.868
I know what it took
to win those Tours.

01:55:08.276 --> 01:55:10.699
Okay, it was a little
more detailed

01:55:10.821 --> 01:55:13.290
than we were told,
or you guys were told.

01:55:14.324 --> 01:55:17.828
But I know what it took, and my
teammates know what it took.

01:55:17.911 --> 01:55:20.585
And those 200-strong pelotons over
seven years, they know what it took.

01:55:20.664 --> 01:55:22.086
And they know who won.

01:55:22.165 --> 01:55:25.590
Did Lance win it according to the
rules of the road at that time?

01:55:25.669 --> 01:55:28.889
Yeah. But did Lance win it
according to the rules?

01:55:28.964 --> 01:55:30.432
No. He still broke the rules.

01:55:30.507 --> 01:55:33.148
Just because everybody's breaking
the rules doesn't mean it's okay.

01:55:34.136 --> 01:55:36.764
Lance still refused
to admit to doping,

01:55:36.847 --> 01:55:39.726
but his fans no longer
believed in his denials.

01:55:40.517 --> 01:55:42.815
With his fairy
tale story in tatters,

01:55:42.894 --> 01:55:45.397
Lance reached out to
friends and critics alike

01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:49.610
and began to wonder out loud if he
should at last admit to his lie.

01:55:50.318 --> 01:55:55.165
After 10 years of his tirade
on me, he called to say he was sorry.

01:55:57.909 --> 01:56:00.207
I still get emotional.
It was...

01:56:02.122 --> 01:56:04.966
It took a lot of courage
for him to say he was sorry

01:56:06.376 --> 01:56:09.596
and for him to tell me

01:56:09.671 --> 01:56:13.221
he's done a lot of bad
things to good people.

01:56:13.300 --> 01:56:15.740
I said, "I'm sure this was a tough
phone call for you to make,

01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:18.104
"and I'm sure that these last two
months have been hell for you."

01:56:18.180 --> 01:56:21.855
But I said, "You know what? You've
put me through hell for 10 years."

01:56:21.933 --> 01:56:23.560
I said, "You're
going through nothing.

01:56:24.060 --> 01:56:26.404
"I hope you do
the right thing."

01:56:27.731 --> 01:56:30.701
He started calling
me and we got to talk

01:56:30.775 --> 01:56:35.246
about how his secrets were
gonna be given to the world.

01:56:36.615 --> 01:56:40.040
His decision to go on
Oprah did not win back his fans,

01:56:40.118 --> 01:56:42.997
particularly those who
had defended his lie.

01:56:43.079 --> 01:56:45.207
For the cycling
crowd, it wasn't enough.

01:56:45.290 --> 01:56:46.837
They didn't hear enough.
They wanted to hear more.

01:56:46.917 --> 01:56:50.512
I didn't say enough.
I didn't tell them enough.

01:56:50.587 --> 01:56:52.760
And for the general
population, it was too much.

01:56:53.256 --> 01:56:55.600
Which leads to
everybody being pissed off.

01:56:55.675 --> 01:56:57.723
Because he had lied for so long

01:56:57.802 --> 01:57:03.434
and he was so vicious
in protecting that lie,

01:57:04.142 --> 01:57:05.143
um...

01:57:05.685 --> 01:57:08.108
I don't think people were...

01:57:08.188 --> 01:57:09.861
I really think that people said,

01:57:09.940 --> 01:57:12.443
"Okay, wait.
Let's see what he does.

01:57:12.526 --> 01:57:15.405
"Just because he says this stuff

01:57:15.529 --> 01:57:18.373
"does not mean
everything is gonna be okay."

01:57:18.448 --> 01:57:20.792
We understand now
that if you wanted to win

01:57:20.909 --> 01:57:23.207
or if you wanted
to help someone win

01:57:23.286 --> 01:57:26.586
or if you wanted to make a good
living, you had to dope in that era.

01:57:26.665 --> 01:57:28.633
We understand that now.

01:57:28.708 --> 01:57:32.212
And I think people
would give him that context,

01:57:32.295 --> 01:57:34.013
but it's the lie.

01:57:34.089 --> 01:57:38.720
The doping is bad, but Lance's
abuse of power is worse.

01:57:38.969 --> 01:57:41.347
I see the anger in people.

01:57:41.846 --> 01:57:44.895
And they have every
right to feel betrayed.

01:57:47.269 --> 01:57:48.395
And it's my fault.

01:57:48.979 --> 01:57:50.822
Yet after all the revelations,

01:57:50.897 --> 01:57:53.241
Lance would continue
to hold onto one thing.

01:57:53.316 --> 01:57:56.365
Was Betsy telling the truth
about the Indiana hospital?

01:57:57.821 --> 01:57:59.448
I'm not gonna take that on.

01:57:59.531 --> 01:58:01.579
I'm laying down on that one.

01:58:01.741 --> 01:58:03.334
Was Betsy lying?

01:58:04.995 --> 01:58:06.542
I'm just not...

01:58:07.831 --> 01:58:09.879
The hospital room
is where it all began.

01:58:09.958 --> 01:58:13.588
It all started at
that damn hospital room.

01:58:13.670 --> 01:58:15.468
And he just...

01:58:17.382 --> 01:58:20.101
He was there. I know the truth.
He knows the truth.

01:58:20.176 --> 01:58:21.928
If it's complicated
for him to say

01:58:22.053 --> 01:58:23.805
that it happened, then fine.
I understand that.

01:58:23.888 --> 01:58:25.561
But at this point...

01:58:25.640 --> 01:58:28.644
It doesn't really matter what
happened in that hospital room.

01:58:28.727 --> 01:58:30.149
Doesn't matter at all anymore.

01:58:30.687 --> 01:58:34.191
But its symbolic
weight is enormous.

01:58:35.317 --> 01:58:36.364
It's not about doping anymore.

01:58:36.443 --> 01:58:38.491
That's out there. That's
the least of his problems.

01:58:38.570 --> 01:58:40.664
He has a support
group that's around him

01:58:40.739 --> 01:58:43.288
that have protected him
for years and years and years.

01:58:43.366 --> 01:58:47.337
And now, if he comes out, he throws
a lot of them under the bus.

01:58:47.412 --> 01:58:50.541
He's not ready. I don't think
he's ready for the entire truth.

01:58:50.832 --> 01:58:53.756
He just can't stand to lose.

01:58:54.336 --> 01:58:57.886
He'll go to any length if he
decides he's not gonna lose.

01:58:58.673 --> 01:59:00.892
I think the stakes are enormous

01:59:00.967 --> 01:59:04.062
for him really coming to terms
with what he did.

01:59:04.846 --> 01:59:09.522
Did you feel in any way
that you were cheating?

01:59:10.602 --> 01:59:11.649
No.

01:59:11.728 --> 01:59:14.072
You did not feel
that you were cheating?

01:59:14.939 --> 01:59:15.986
At the time, no.

01:59:16.066 --> 01:59:18.740
Psychologically, when you
tell that lie for that long

01:59:18.818 --> 01:59:22.072
over and over and over
and people are believing it,

01:59:22.155 --> 01:59:24.578
it's very, very difficult,
if not impossible,

01:59:24.658 --> 01:59:26.501
to fully reckon
with that right away.

01:59:26.618 --> 01:59:28.962
I kept hearing, you know, I'm a...
That you're a cheat.

01:59:29.245 --> 01:59:31.839
I'm a drug cheat.
I'm a cheat. I'm a cheater.

01:59:31.915 --> 01:59:34.885
And I went and looked up
the definition of "cheat."

01:59:35.251 --> 01:59:36.844
Yes?

01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:40.800
And the definition of cheat is "to
gain an advantage on a rival or foe."

01:59:40.882 --> 01:59:43.681
You know, that they don't
have, or that, you know...

01:59:43.760 --> 01:59:44.977
I didn't view it that way.

01:59:47.681 --> 01:59:51.185
GiBNEY: Another definition
for cheat is "to deceive."

01:59:51.267 --> 01:59:54.020
That's why Lance is a cheater.

01:59:54.104 --> 01:59:55.651
He deceived his fans.

01:59:55.730 --> 01:59:59.234
Yet it's also fair to say that
they were willing to be fooled.

01:59:59.442 --> 02:00:02.241
So many people,
from cancer survivors,

02:00:02.362 --> 02:00:05.115
to reporters,
to sponsors, to myself

02:00:05.198 --> 02:00:08.873
loved the beautiful lie
more than the ugly truth.

02:00:08.952 --> 02:00:11.375
The story was
a bestseller for Lance, too.

02:00:11.454 --> 02:00:14.958
It made him a fortune
of over $125 million.

02:00:16.334 --> 02:00:18.177
That is a bitter truth.

02:00:18.253 --> 02:00:20.847
It pays to believe in
winning at all costs.

02:00:20.922 --> 02:00:23.926
And the cruelty Lance showed
his enemies off the bike

02:00:24.008 --> 02:00:27.478
was the very thing that allowed
him to win on the bike.

02:00:31.266 --> 02:00:34.190
People will forgive and forget
and move on, or they won't.

02:00:34.269 --> 02:00:36.943
And there will be
plenty of the latter.

02:00:37.021 --> 02:00:38.068
Sure.

02:00:38.148 --> 02:00:41.243
You know, at some point people will
say, "Okay, here's what happened."

02:00:41.317 --> 02:00:46.073
And then judge for themselves.

02:00:46.156 --> 02:00:49.285
I mean, I don't know what people
will think in 20, 30, 40, 50 years.

02:00:49.367 --> 02:00:51.415
Is the record book still gonna
be blank for seven years?

02:00:51.494 --> 02:00:54.998
I guess it will be.
