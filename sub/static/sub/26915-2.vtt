WEBVTT

00:11.469 --> 00:13.638
I wish we could get new tack for Puzzle.

00:14.264 --> 00:18.101
I know. We only have that old halter
and bridle and saddle for him.

00:18.351 --> 00:20.311
He needs his own new equipment.

00:22.313 --> 00:23.565
How about a fundraiser?

00:24.733 --> 00:26.651
At the bowling alley?

00:27.152 --> 00:29.279
I will so beat you this time.

00:29.362 --> 00:31.948
Yes, to the fundraiser
at the bowling alley.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.576
No, to you getting a higher score
than I do.

00:34.659 --> 00:37.328
[scoffs] No way. It's my game.

00:37.912 --> 00:41.875
Let's both get a high score
so the Ponysitters team can win.

00:42.083 --> 00:43.960
-Sounds good.

[Ethan] Sorry, Skye.

01:17.827 --> 01:20.830
My soccer team's car wash
that got rained out,

01:21.414 --> 01:24.167
it's on the same day as the fundraiser.

01:24.250 --> 01:27.420
No way. I already lost Isabella
due to an injury.

01:28.046 --> 01:31.257
If only they had invented
a lighter bowling ball.

01:32.383 --> 01:34.427
Skye, I'm out, too.

01:34.844 --> 01:37.555
Wha--? Three of you out?

01:38.097 --> 01:41.810
No. Trish, Haversham Riding Stables
promised me and my mom

01:41.893 --> 01:44.187
they'd make a donation for each player.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.981
More people bowl,
the more we raise for Puzzle.

01:47.065 --> 01:50.568
I'm really sorry, but my legs
won't be working very well.

01:50.652 --> 01:52.654
They're going to be really rubbery.

01:52.737 --> 01:54.155
I'm already dizzy.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.157
That does not sound good.

01:59.035 --> 02:01.121
You know my friend's dog, Nicky?

02:01.204 --> 02:02.413
Uh, the beagle?

02:02.497 --> 02:06.084
Grandpa checked her out
and said I should stay with her here

02:06.167 --> 02:08.837
because... she's going to have puppies!

02:08.920 --> 02:12.048
Little, cute baby beagles. [whimpers]

02:12.132 --> 02:14.843
So you'll be on baby beagle watch.

02:14.926 --> 02:18.221
Exactly. Baby beagle watch.
They could arrive anytime.

02:18.471 --> 02:20.723
And you'll have "baby beagle syndrome."

02:21.141 --> 02:23.685
Baby beagles have more cuteness
than I can handle.

02:24.644 --> 02:27.647
Here's the mama-to-be. Freshly walked.

02:27.730 --> 02:29.440
Who doesn't love puppies?

02:29.524 --> 02:32.318
If I'm not with her
when those puppies show up,

02:32.402 --> 02:33.903
I'll never forgive myself.

02:33.987 --> 02:37.991
But we need three people to make a team.
Now it's just Olivia and me.

02:38.074 --> 02:41.286
I tried Shelby,
but she hates wearing bowling shoes

02:41.369 --> 02:44.080
because other smelly feet
have been in them.

02:44.455 --> 02:47.167
Why don't you take
regular bowling shoes, polish them,

02:47.250 --> 02:50.003
put them in a new box
and they'll be good as new?

02:50.545 --> 02:53.548
That might be okay. I'll try.

02:53.631 --> 02:56.968
Skye, Penny and Bianca
are gonna bowl with me.

02:57.051 --> 02:59.345
We're gonna be the Glitterballs.

02:59.429 --> 03:01.764
Well, that's two teams, anyway.

03:01.931 --> 03:06.269
-Grandpa, did you get your team together?
-[sighs] Sorry, no commitments yet.

03:06.352 --> 03:08.646
-Your buddies still bickering?
-Yeah.

03:08.730 --> 03:12.317
I used to love bowling with those guys
on Thursday nights.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.819
I'll call them back.

03:16.571 --> 03:18.323
Trish, you okay?

03:18.406 --> 03:21.951
[gasping] Nicky's going to have puppies.

03:22.660 --> 03:24.871
Yeah, in about four days. [scoffs]

03:24.954 --> 03:28.625
Heart melting, legs rubber.

03:28.708 --> 03:30.084
Come on, Trish.

03:30.460 --> 03:33.796
Trish, I'll help you prepare
for baby bundles of cuteness.

03:33.880 --> 03:34.839
[giggles]

03:35.340 --> 03:38.134
Baby beagles. Baby beagles.

03:38.968 --> 03:40.970
Barry. Did you get my message?

03:41.554 --> 03:45.475
Yes. Didn't want to call back
because you mentioned George.

03:45.767 --> 03:48.895
George? We're all good friends.
What did George do?

03:49.312 --> 03:53.524
He returned my best bowling ball
with a chip out of it.

03:53.608 --> 03:56.361
-I'm sure he didn't mean to.
-I'm sure he did.

03:56.444 --> 03:59.822
-It matches the chip on his shoulder.
-You didn't mean that.

04:00.448 --> 04:01.616
Skye...

04:02.909 --> 04:06.663
what do think about maybe
postponing this fundraiser?

04:07.121 --> 04:09.874
I can talk to the manager,
get our deposit back.

04:09.958 --> 04:13.586
George wasn't holding us back.
We all had decent scores.

04:13.670 --> 04:16.381
The only strike
he's ever bowled in his life

04:16.464 --> 04:19.467
was when a ball skipped over
from another lane.

04:20.134 --> 04:22.595
I'm sure we all scored
pretty much the same.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.597
-Hmm. [grunts]
-[phone beeps]

04:24.764 --> 04:25.807
Barry?

04:27.058 --> 04:28.017
Barry?

04:28.601 --> 04:30.436
-[phone beeps]
-Barry?

04:33.314 --> 04:36.943
Skye, help your grandpa out.
Is it me or the phone?

04:37.026 --> 04:38.945
Oh, Grandpa.

04:40.238 --> 04:43.032
I don't think it's a good idea
to be on your team.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.201
You can't bowl?

04:45.868 --> 04:49.872
Oh, in front of people, I get nervous.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.541
Alone, I'm great.

04:51.749 --> 04:53.001
Well, let's see.

04:54.335 --> 04:55.169
Okay.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.096
[pins clattering]

05:06.097 --> 05:09.017
Oh! Hello, first place!

05:10.393 --> 05:13.271
-You're like a... a professional.
-[both chuckling]

05:13.980 --> 05:16.649
Because you're the only one
who's watching me.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.735
Hi, ladies. [sighs]

05:19.277 --> 05:21.654
We have to postpone the fundraiser.

05:22.238 --> 05:23.072
Postpone?

05:23.448 --> 05:26.159
No. We can win this.

05:26.534 --> 05:28.286
You should see Penny bowl.

05:28.953 --> 05:30.413
Show Billy how you bowl.

05:30.663 --> 05:33.082
Uh, two people watching?

05:33.333 --> 05:35.752
[nervous chuckle] This might not work.

05:36.252 --> 05:39.922
She's very good. As in very good.

05:41.215 --> 05:43.885
As in perfect good. [chuckles]

05:43.968 --> 05:46.846
Whoo-whoo! [laughs]

05:59.317 --> 06:00.526
[Bianca] Oh.

06:00.902 --> 06:03.112
I told you, I can't bowl in a crowd.

06:03.362 --> 06:06.866
[gasps] We have to come up
with a solution.

06:07.450 --> 06:08.993
I'm not a fan of losing.

06:09.827 --> 06:12.413
I'm gonna ask for our deposit back.

06:12.789 --> 06:13.748
[Penny] Okay.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.420
Oh. Try again.

06:20.129 --> 06:21.255
[puffs]

06:21.339 --> 06:25.384
I-25, I don't think you'll be
part of bingo tonight.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.261
[laughs]

06:28.429 --> 06:29.847
-Excuse me.
-[clattering]

06:31.724 --> 06:34.852
Hi. I'm Billy, from Rescue Ranch.

06:34.936 --> 06:37.730
-Sorry, hope I'm not interrupting.
-Ah, no, no.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.483
I wasn't hiding the balls.
I put them in there

06:40.566 --> 06:43.736
so I can take them in here
and clean them later, yeah.

06:43.820 --> 06:44.654
-Ah.
-Yeah.

06:45.279 --> 06:47.532
We have our fundraiser tomorrow,

06:47.615 --> 06:50.076
but we're having trouble getting teams,

06:50.159 --> 06:52.370
so we may need to postpone.

06:52.453 --> 06:54.580
I wonder if we could get our deposit.

06:54.664 --> 06:57.542
[gasps] Oh, your deposit back.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.168
[manager] Whew.

06:59.252 --> 07:02.839
Well, whew. Actually... [laughs]

07:02.922 --> 07:05.174
It's just that I have...

07:05.258 --> 07:08.052
a way of doing things, and actually, uh...

07:08.136 --> 07:11.222
-[winces, exhales]
-I hope it's not a problem.

07:11.305 --> 07:13.558
-I--
-Well, actually, it is.

07:13.641 --> 07:16.269
[snickers] It is a problem, actually.

07:16.352 --> 07:18.396
Whew... [gasps]

07:18.563 --> 07:19.522
Oh...!

07:22.567 --> 07:24.694
You know what? We'll keep the date.

07:27.905 --> 07:28.781
[phone beeping]

07:31.200 --> 07:34.454
[Billy] Dad? Yeah, hi.
Listen, I don't care what it takes.

07:34.537 --> 07:36.831
I need you to get a team together now.

07:37.206 --> 07:38.583
Yep. Bye.

07:38.791 --> 07:39.709
[phone beeps]

07:41.669 --> 07:46.090
You are really doing a great job with her.
I've gotta make another call, okay?

07:47.467 --> 07:49.719
[phone beeps]

07:50.636 --> 07:53.806
-[line ringing]
-George, buddy.

07:54.015 --> 07:58.102
-We bowl, right?
-No way, Dillon. Not with Barry.

07:58.352 --> 07:59.312
I-I'm sorry.
Just excuse us for one moment.

07:59.854 --> 08:03.733
Not while Barry thinks he's the captain,
calling all the shots.

08:04.358 --> 08:06.652
Listen, he just booked the lanes.

08:06.736 --> 08:10.406
And chose the shirts-- without asking us.

08:10.823 --> 08:12.074
He didn't mean to.

08:12.283 --> 08:13.784
Oh, I'm sure he did.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.370
Oh, here we go again.

08:16.746 --> 08:19.749
Listen, that was a long time ago, George.

08:19.832 --> 08:20.791
-[beeps]
-Humph.

08:21.542 --> 08:22.585
George?

08:24.003 --> 08:24.921
George?

08:25.087 --> 08:25.922
[rattling]

08:38.351 --> 08:40.394
[Olivia] Size six, please.

08:41.229 --> 08:42.939
[chuckles] Thank you.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.651
[coughing]

08:47.318 --> 08:48.152
[sniffs]

08:50.863 --> 08:51.989
Yeah.

09:14.178 --> 09:17.139
Hi, Shelby. Over here.

09:17.765 --> 09:21.644
Don't try to talk me into bowling.
I'm here to watch, that's all.

09:22.687 --> 09:25.189
Uh, got something for you.

09:25.273 --> 09:26.857
For me? [gasps] Thank you.

09:26.941 --> 09:30.278
I love opening presents.
I wish I could do it every day.

09:34.949 --> 09:37.076
My own bowling shoes?

09:37.827 --> 09:41.914
-Yep, in a nice, new box.
-Try 'em on.

09:47.086 --> 09:51.465
[Shelby] Over, under, round and through,
that is how you tie your shoe.

09:52.258 --> 09:55.720
A little tight, but that's probably
just because they're new.

09:55.803 --> 09:57.013
Gotta break them in.

10:01.726 --> 10:02.643
Yeah.

10:03.352 --> 10:05.771
Very nice. I like them. Good choice.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.690
[chuckles] You look great.

10:07.815 --> 10:10.067
You know what? I'm ready to bowl.

10:12.528 --> 10:13.362
[giggles]

10:15.781 --> 10:18.117
[gasps] I love the horseshoe.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.202
[rock music playing]

10:42.933 --> 10:47.730
Ladies, official Glitterball outfits.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.815
[club music playing]

11:06.832 --> 11:09.669
And now for the answer
to Penny's nervousness.

11:13.714 --> 11:14.548
Blinders?

11:15.466 --> 11:17.259
I am not wearing these.

11:17.343 --> 11:18.761
Just try them.

11:19.887 --> 11:20.930
Oh.

11:21.013 --> 11:23.599
[laughs] You look like a milk horse.

11:24.100 --> 11:27.186
I am not wearing horse blinders.

11:27.812 --> 11:31.357
[sighs] First gutterball,
you're wearing them.

11:32.733 --> 11:36.904
Dillon, why didn't you start
by telling us this was for charity?

11:37.279 --> 11:40.991
I've forgotten how much I love
the smell of a bowling alley.

11:41.075 --> 11:43.327
Ah, it's just like old times, guys.

11:44.662 --> 11:46.414
Um, who's captain?

11:47.790 --> 11:51.794
Fine. Barry, if you wanna be captain,
be captain.

11:52.169 --> 11:56.382
No, no.
Let's have a vote, make it official.

11:56.465 --> 11:58.551
We don't need a vote.

11:58.634 --> 12:01.178
I need to see a vote.

12:01.262 --> 12:05.349
I want to know that I have the hearts
and the will of the team.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.601
[sighs] Okay. Show of hands.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.770
Who wants Barry to be captain?

12:10.980 --> 12:13.065
[sighs] Okay, it's official.

12:13.482 --> 12:18.028
Let's put this bickering behind us.
We're a fighting force. Nerves of steel.

12:18.612 --> 12:20.489
-Name of the team?
-"Geezers."

12:21.740 --> 12:25.077
It doesn't strike fear
into the hearts of our opponents,

12:25.161 --> 12:27.246
but okay.

12:27.788 --> 12:29.999
On the count of three. One...

12:30.082 --> 12:31.500
-Two...
-Three.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.336
-[all] Go, Geezers!
-Let's go, geezer. Come on.

12:34.420 --> 12:37.798
We could've been the Stallions,
the Fighting Lions.

12:37.882 --> 12:39.758
We could've been anything.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.475
Hi, Ethan.

12:47.558 --> 12:49.351
[sighs] It rained out.

12:49.727 --> 12:52.062
-Yes. Bowling.
-Bowling.

12:52.313 --> 12:56.567
Yay! Okay, go grab some bowling shoes.
Do you guys have a team name?

12:56.734 --> 12:58.944
-The Strikers?
-[Skye] Strikers it is.

12:59.111 --> 13:01.739
Okay, now we have four teams
which is perfect.

13:01.822 --> 13:06.535
The Ponysitters, the Strikers,
Glitterballs, and the Geezers.

13:16.003 --> 13:16.879
[whimpers]

13:16.962 --> 13:20.758
-[gasps] Oh. Oh!
-Ouch! You think it's time?

13:20.841 --> 13:22.134
-[moans]
-[chuckles]

13:26.931 --> 13:29.642
Ladies and gentlemen,

13:29.725 --> 13:34.021
welcome to Bowl-a-bama!

13:35.898 --> 13:38.817
-This is it.
-[bell ringing]

13:38.901 --> 13:42.446
The first annual Ponysitters'

13:42.530 --> 13:46.367
Bowling Fundraiser!

13:59.505 --> 14:04.385
Today only, each bowler will be guaranteed

14:04.468 --> 14:07.888
a generous Rescue Ranch donation

14:08.055 --> 14:13.477
from Haversham Riding Stables!

14:13.561 --> 14:14.395

14:15.854 --> 14:21.068
Let's get ready to bowl!

14:46.510 --> 14:47.636
[clattering]

14:48.345 --> 14:50.723
[clattering]

14:55.311 --> 14:57.104
-[Bianca] Oh.
-So close.

14:57.187 --> 14:58.272
[Penny] I'm sorry.

14:58.355 --> 14:59.732
Gutterball.

14:59.815 --> 15:03.110
-Next time, next time.
-[Penny groans]

15:04.028 --> 15:05.321
[Bianca] Try again.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.157
She'll get it this time.

15:10.284 --> 15:12.953
-[Billy] Come on.
-[Bianca] Penny, come on.

15:13.537 --> 15:16.040
-[cheering]
-Yay!

15:18.959 --> 15:19.960
That's it!

15:20.836 --> 15:24.381
-There are rules!
-[Bianca] You're back in the game.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.800
-[Billy] Thank you.
-I know.

15:27.259 --> 15:30.888
Sorry, illegal use of bowling equipment.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.850
Archie.

15:35.059 --> 15:37.102
Archie, Arch. [chuckles]

15:37.227 --> 15:41.148
Archie, old boy. Let's shake on it.

15:43.233 --> 15:45.361
Glad you understand.

15:46.654 --> 15:51.116
Are you trying to bribe me with a hot dog?

15:51.992 --> 15:53.661
Bianca.

15:54.662 --> 15:56.538
-It was worth a try.
-[scoffs]

15:57.790 --> 15:59.041
I'm sorry.

16:00.542 --> 16:02.544
-Goodbye, first place.
-[sighs]

16:06.298 --> 16:07.591
[pins clattering]

16:11.637 --> 16:12.805
[softly] Come on...

16:21.689 --> 16:22.564
Oh!

16:22.648 --> 16:23.899
You're going down!

16:26.568 --> 16:28.320
[cheering]

16:33.075 --> 16:35.369
I think she's about to have them.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.580
Little baby beag--

16:38.872 --> 16:40.874
I need to lie down. [sighs]

16:43.794 --> 16:46.213
[Archie] We have two winners!

16:46.296 --> 16:49.216
-The Ponysitters!
-[crowd cheering]

16:49.550 --> 16:52.177
[Archie] And the Geezers!

16:55.055 --> 16:57.808
The Geezers will go up
against the Ponysitters

16:57.891 --> 17:00.394
-in a battle for first place.
-Whoo!

17:00.644 --> 17:04.106
[Archie] Commencing
after a ten-minute break.

17:08.777 --> 17:10.446
We should do that again.

17:10.529 --> 17:13.157
Yeah. But it was tougher than I thought.

17:13.907 --> 17:15.576
I think my new shoes helped.

17:16.368 --> 17:19.288
-Those aren't new shoes.
-What do you mean?

17:20.122 --> 17:21.415
Yeah, not new.

17:21.498 --> 17:24.960
See, the leather is cracked
from people wearing them.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.920
-What?
-[Olivia] Uh, Shelby,

17:27.004 --> 17:29.256
how about we warm up for the final game?

17:29.548 --> 17:32.092
Not new? Skye, is that true?

17:34.011 --> 17:35.471
I'm sorry.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.598
Uh, the box is new.

17:37.848 --> 17:40.267
I'm wearing rentals? That's disgusting.

17:40.601 --> 17:43.479
They spray them with disinfectant.
They are clean.

17:43.645 --> 17:46.648
Other feet have sweated in these. Ew.

17:46.732 --> 17:49.318
Ew, ew, ew.

17:53.530 --> 17:56.492
Ew, ew, ew.

17:57.367 --> 17:59.703
Ugh. What's the matter with her?

18:00.079 --> 18:01.663
Used shoes.

18:01.747 --> 18:04.249
Oh. Let me see what I can do.

18:10.506 --> 18:13.300
It's nice to see
old friends back together.

18:14.635 --> 18:18.180
We should make it a weekly thing again.
Thursdays.

18:18.722 --> 18:21.350
I'll volunteer to book the lanes

18:21.433 --> 18:23.685
if you choose our new shirts.

18:24.186 --> 18:26.021
-Thursdays are good.
-Yeah.

18:26.271 --> 18:30.234
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew...

18:30.317 --> 18:31.944
Ew! [whines]

18:35.989 --> 18:38.117
These are straight from the factory.

18:39.409 --> 18:40.953
Wrapped in plastic.

18:41.745 --> 18:43.122
Thank you.

18:43.455 --> 18:44.957
Can I tell you a secret?

18:45.457 --> 18:47.334
I don't wear the rentals either.

18:47.668 --> 18:49.294
-They're gross.
-Right?

18:49.378 --> 18:51.421
-Between you and me, okay?
-Okay.

18:59.096 --> 19:00.514
[cheering]

19:00.597 --> 19:02.266
[Shelby] No pressure!

19:02.349 --> 19:05.352
No pressure!
Just knock down all the pins.

19:14.653 --> 19:16.280
[people cheering]

19:18.949 --> 19:20.033
[giggles]

19:22.369 --> 19:23.245
[Skye] Come on.

19:23.328 --> 19:24.371
Okay.

19:35.090 --> 19:37.926
-[applause]
-Yes, you.

20:21.011 --> 20:23.180
[cheering, screaming]

20:26.266 --> 20:29.019
We have a winner!

20:31.104 --> 20:35.567
Nice game, Geezers,
but it's the Ponysitters by one point!

20:36.735 --> 20:40.989
There's a new saddle coming for Puzzle.
Congratulations. Here's your trophy.

20:41.365 --> 20:43.242
-[gasps] Whoa.
-Oh.

20:43.325 --> 20:45.911
Thank you so much. Puzzle is so grateful.

20:46.536 --> 20:48.622
-Yay!
-[Skye] One...

20:48.705 --> 20:49.957
-Two...
-Three!

20:50.040 --> 20:52.292
[all] Ponysitters! Whoo!

20:58.340 --> 20:59.341
[Puzzle nickers]

21:01.969 --> 21:03.011
[both giggling]

21:03.220 --> 21:04.888
It's your day today, Puzzle.

21:04.972 --> 21:10.519
You finally have
your brand-new saddle, halter and bridle.

21:10.602 --> 21:12.521
Care of the Ponysitters.

21:12.604 --> 21:13.855
[both giggling]

21:16.191 --> 21:17.317
[Grandpa] So cute.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.653
-Here they are, thanks to Grandpa.
-Hey.

21:19.736 --> 21:20.821
Ta-da!

21:23.282 --> 21:24.866
[all sigh]

21:24.950 --> 21:26.618
So, what are their names?

21:27.577 --> 21:30.455
Since they were born
right after the fundraiser,

21:30.539 --> 21:31.790
we went with...

21:32.374 --> 21:33.208
Archie,

21:34.710 --> 21:39.006
Sitter, Striker, Glitterball, and Geezer.

21:39.172 --> 21:42.426
-Aw, so cute. Little puppies!
-Aw, they are so cute.

21:42.509 --> 21:43.427
[both giggling]

21:44.219 --> 21:47.681
-[Trish] Got over my baby beagle syndrome.
-[all chuckling]

21:47.889 --> 21:49.641
It was exposure therapy.

21:49.725 --> 21:52.102
[all chuckling]
