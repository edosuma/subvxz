00:25.060 --> 00:27.660
From the darkest depths
of cyberspace,

00:27.660 --> 00:30.740
there is another world.

00:30.740 --> 00:35.380
A lost dimension,
home to wonders unseen,

00:35.380 --> 00:37.300
terrors unspeakable.

00:39.220 --> 00:43.700
Stories unlike any

01:10.740 --> 01:12.260
So, what do you do?

01:16.660 --> 01:18.700
Huh?

01:18.700 --> 01:20.620
What do you do?

01:20.620 --> 01:23.260
Oh, uh, I kinda run
this music blog.

01:23.260 --> 01:25.180
Uh‐huh, and where are you from?

01:25.180 --> 01:27.220
Well, originally I'm from Maine.

01:27.220 --> 01:31.260
Uh‐huh, and where
do you live now?

01:31.260 --> 01:33.140
Right here, in Brooklyn.

01:41.700 --> 01:43.060
So, what do you do?

01:43.060 --> 01:45.300
I don't like to talk about work.

01:47.580 --> 01:50.500
Look, I hate these things, too.

01:50.500 --> 01:52.180
You know, I feel like
everyone in the room

01:52.180 --> 01:53.900
can tell that we're
on a first date.

01:53.900 --> 01:56.740
No one's paying attention.

01:56.740 --> 01:58.900
So, if you could be any animal,

01:58.900 --> 02:00.300
what animal would you be?

02:00.300 --> 02:03.340
This isn't going
very well, is it?

02:03.340 --> 02:05.580
Yeah, no, this is over.

02:05.580 --> 02:06.940
You can go.

02:16.020 --> 02:18.660
Some romances last a lifetime,

02:18.660 --> 02:21.580
but most don't make it past
the first cup of coffee.

02:21.580 --> 02:25.460
Still, don't feel too bad
for our lonely lovebird Adam.

02:25.460 --> 02:27.780
Thanks to the magic
of ones and zeroes,

02:27.780 --> 02:30.220
he's about to meet
his one and only.

02:30.220 --> 02:31.700
Her name's Amanda.

02:31.700 --> 02:34.180
She likes craft
beer, good music,

02:34.180 --> 02:36.940
and she lives on
the Lower East Side

02:36.940 --> 02:38.860
of Dimension 404.

02:43.100 --> 02:45.820
Well, it's official.

02:45.820 --> 02:47.500
I'm gonna die alone.

02:47.500 --> 02:48.660
What?

02:48.660 --> 02:49.940
Don't say that.

02:49.940 --> 02:52.180
Greg, I've looked, flirted,

02:52.180 --> 02:54.300
and met‐cute half of
the women in Brooklyn,

02:54.300 --> 02:55.860
and I'm honestly
starting to think

02:55.860 --> 02:57.780
that my soul mate doesn't exist.

02:57.780 --> 03:00.300
You know, she's like
a myth, like Bigfoot.

03:00.300 --> 03:03.020
Dude, she exists,
she's out there.

03:03.020 --> 03:05.300
Just like Bigfoot.

03:05.300 --> 03:07.460
‐Wow, I need a beer.
‐You're out of beer.

03:07.460 --> 03:10.940
Look, man, you just
gotta broaden your horizons.

03:13.060 --> 03:15.340
Stop meeting weird
randos on the street

03:15.340 --> 03:16.940
and start meeting them online.

03:16.940 --> 03:18.820
Online, online dating?

03:18.820 --> 03:19.940
‐Yeah.
‐No!

03:19.940 --> 03:21.380
Look, I don't want
some algorithm

03:21.380 --> 03:23.460
telling me who to hook
up with, all right?

03:23.460 --> 03:26.020
I just want to meet
a cute girl, you know,

03:26.020 --> 03:28.460
with a cute little
red streak in her hair

03:28.460 --> 03:30.180
and a tattoo of a bird

03:30.180 --> 03:32.700
while we're both reaching
for the same Talking Heads LP.

03:32.700 --> 03:36.180
There are 413 eligible women
that are Talking Heads fans

03:36.180 --> 03:39.300
within a two‐mile radius
of this apartment.

03:39.300 --> 03:42.020
Wait, really;
what is that?

03:42.020 --> 03:43.900
Make‐A‐Match, bro,
everybody's on it.

03:43.900 --> 03:46.220
Why are you on it,
aren't you with Charlene?

03:46.220 --> 03:49.020
I'm not on it, you are.

03:49.020 --> 03:51.300
‐I made you a profile.
‐What, when?

03:51.300 --> 03:52.860
Last night when I
drank all your beer.

03:52.860 --> 03:54.540
‐Greg!
‐Come on, man.

03:54.540 --> 03:57.540
Look at all of these women.

03:57.540 --> 03:59.460
What do you have to lose?

03:59.460 --> 04:01.140
All right, fine.

04:01.140 --> 04:04.620
But seriously, stop
drinking all my beer.

04:04.620 --> 04:06.500
No promises.

04:06.500 --> 04:09.020
I can't afford it,
you can, so I drink it.

04:11.340 --> 04:12.780
We met on Make‐A‐Match.

04:16.300 --> 04:18.019
Make‐A‐Match
helped me find exactly

04:18.019 --> 04:20.260
what I've been
looking for all my life.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.500
Their personality profile
truly reached deeper

04:22.500 --> 04:23.900
than the other sites.

04:26.100 --> 04:29.100
It's magic, I don't
know how they do it.

04:29.100 --> 04:30.580
At Make‐A‐Match, we believe

04:30.580 --> 04:33.140
there's someone out
there for everyone.

04:33.140 --> 04:37.540
Sign up today and we'll find
your 100 percent perfect match

04:37.540 --> 04:38.900
guaranteed.

04:38.900 --> 04:40.420
Welcome to love.

04:40.420 --> 04:42.420
Welcome to Make‐A‐Match.

05:09.540 --> 05:10.780
Amanda.

05:10.780 --> 05:14.460
She's a med student,
she likes hanging out.

05:14.460 --> 05:16.620
I mean, she's cute.

05:16.620 --> 05:18.300
Favorite band: The Pixies.

05:18.300 --> 05:20.740
That's a start.

05:20.740 --> 05:23.020
Yeah, but still, I mean...

05:23.020 --> 05:25.380
this is my 100 percent match?

05:25.380 --> 05:27.100
Where's her bird tattoo?

05:27.100 --> 05:28.780
Oh, my God, she winked you.

05:28.780 --> 05:30.500
‐She what?
‐She checked you out

05:30.500 --> 05:32.180
and she likes what she sees.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.660
Just ask her out already.

05:35.660 --> 05:37.820
God, you know, this‐‐
this‐‐this is too weird.

05:37.820 --> 05:39.180
I can't do it, I'm out, no.

05:39.180 --> 05:41.220
Dude, you are going
on a date with this girl

05:41.220 --> 05:43.260
if I have to pump you
full of benzodiazepine

05:43.260 --> 05:46.500
and drag you there myself.

05:46.500 --> 05:50.700
Fine, but only because
I am desperately lonely.

No, I‐I went, I saw him
at Great Woods in 2001,

and I basically went
through puberty on the spot.

09:00.220 --> 09:02.900
You're out of beer;
what are you talking about?

09:02.900 --> 09:04.620
Buddy, I'm talking about Amanda.

09:04.620 --> 09:06.740
She's... dude, she's...

09:06.740 --> 09:08.100
I dont‐‐‐she's amazing.

09:08.100 --> 09:09.100
I'm gonna get her a ring.

09:09.100 --> 09:10.380
I mean, not an engagement ring,

09:10.380 --> 09:13.700
but like a really,
really nice ring.

09:15.820 --> 09:18.900
Okay, uh, have a seat, Casanova.

09:21.540 --> 09:24.220
How long have you been
with this girl, a month?

09:24.220 --> 09:25.780
Maybe two?

09:25.780 --> 09:28.540
Yeah, but‐‐but I feel
like I have known her

09:28.540 --> 09:29.860
my whole life.

09:29.860 --> 09:31.820
Sure, but if you want
to make it to three,

09:31.820 --> 09:33.220
maybe you should cool your jets.

09:33.220 --> 09:35.220
Okay, I get it,
I get what you're saying,

09:35.220 --> 09:37.260
but, buddy, we're
100 percent compatible.

09:37.260 --> 09:39.220
‐The app said so.
‐Forget what the app said.

09:39.220 --> 09:40.900
Come on, I mean,
you're the one who sold me

09:40.900 --> 09:42.180
on the whole Make‐A‐Match thing.

09:42.180 --> 09:43.540
I thought you'd
be stoked for me.

09:43.540 --> 09:46.860
I am, I am, it's just, um...

09:46.860 --> 09:49.420
I don't want to
see you get hurt.

09:51.020 --> 09:54.940
All right, so, you're
saying just...

09:54.940 --> 09:56.260
slow things down?

Exactly.

09:57.420 --> 09:58.580

‐All right.
‐Okay.

10:01.780 --> 10:04.540
I love you.

10:04.540 --> 10:05.740
What?

10:05.740 --> 10:08.220
These last two months
have been amazing,

10:08.220 --> 10:09.940
and I just‐‐I keep thinking

10:09.940 --> 10:13.140
about spending the rest
of my life with you.

10:13.140 --> 10:16.500
You're my soul mate, Amanda.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.300
Are you sure?

10:18.300 --> 10:20.180
Are you not sure?

10:20.180 --> 10:21.380
Oh, God.

10:21.380 --> 10:23.740
‐Oh, God?
‐Look, it's not you, I just‐‐

10:23.740 --> 10:26.740
I don't have time for
anything serious right now.

10:26.740 --> 10:29.060
We've spent every single
night here since we met.

10:29.060 --> 10:31.620
And it's been great, it's
just my residency interviews

10:31.620 --> 10:36.780
are coming up, so... So...

10:36.780 --> 10:39.780
So... maybe you should go.

10:42.580 --> 10:45.780
Uh, o‐‐okay.

10:48.700 --> 10:50.180
Wow, um...

10:50.180 --> 10:53.140
This is, uh, yeah,
this is our first big fight.

10:53.140 --> 10:54.740
It's, uh, it's a milestone.

10:54.740 --> 10:56.300
‐Adam, stop.
‐Look, someday,

10:56.300 --> 10:58.140
we're gonna look back on
this and we're gonna laugh.

10:58.140 --> 11:01.140
‐Adam!
‐Come on, we can make this work.

11:01.140 --> 11:03.340
Look, if you want to go
slow, we'll go slow.

11:03.340 --> 11:05.340
I'm serious, goodbye.

11:17.700 --> 11:19.020
No.

11:19.020 --> 11:21.340
No, I'm not gonna just
walk away, all right?

11:21.340 --> 11:22.580
I can't.

11:22.580 --> 11:24.540
Look, I know that you're scared.

11:24.540 --> 11:27.620
All right, I'm scared, too.

11:27.620 --> 11:33.740
But you and I... we're
made for each other.

11:33.740 --> 11:35.340
Oh, for the love of God.

11:35.340 --> 11:38.540
This is something that we'll
tell our adorable grandch‐‐

11:38.540 --> 11:40.300
Ow, whoa, hey!

11:40.300 --> 11:43.180
‐Whoa, hey!
‐I got his legs, let's move.

11:43.180 --> 11:46.860
Tech Support to HQ,
Romeo is in the bag.

11:46.860 --> 11:50.140
Moving to extraction point.

11:50.140 --> 11:51.140
Help!

11:52.540 --> 11:53.860
Help!

12:10.780 --> 12:12.260
Greg?

12:12.260 --> 12:14.700
‐Greg?
‐Adam?

12:14.700 --> 12:16.220
Hey, man, I'm‐‐

12:16.220 --> 12:17.700
dude, I'm freaking out, man.

12:17.700 --> 12:19.860
‐What's going on, man?
‐They tried to kidnap me.

12:19.860 --> 12:22.340
I‐I‐I was over at
Amanda's place, and‐‐

12:22.340 --> 12:24.540
Wait, wait, wait, what's
going on with Amanda?

12:24.540 --> 12:26.100
I‐I don't know, all right?

12:26.100 --> 12:28.700
She, um, she‐‐she dumped me,
and then these guys‐‐

12:28.700 --> 12:31.100
Wait, wait, she dumped you?

12:31.100 --> 12:34.140
Oh, man, I told you
to play it cool.

12:34.140 --> 12:36.820
Yeah, I‐I know.

12:36.820 --> 12:37.820
I‐I don't know‐‐

12:37.820 --> 12:39.060
It's okay, man, come here.

12:39.060 --> 12:40.660
Come on in, man, come on.

12:40.660 --> 12:41.580
Come on.

12:41.580 --> 12:42.900
Bring it in, bring it in.

12:42.900 --> 12:45.340
‐Bring it in.
‐I love her, Greg.

12:45.340 --> 12:47.020
What am I gonna do?

12:56.420 --> 12:58.100
Package is secure.

13:15.220 --> 13:17.580
Are you ready to begin?

13:17.580 --> 13:18.900
What?

13:18.900 --> 13:22.780
How would you describe your
performance in the relationship?

13:22.780 --> 13:23.940
Who the hell are you?

13:23.940 --> 13:26.100
Very satisfactory, satisfactory,

13:26.100 --> 13:28.900
or needs improvement?

13:28.900 --> 13:30.620
What the hell's going on?

13:30.620 --> 13:32.620
We'll put "needs improvement."

13:32.620 --> 13:34.860
Would you agree that
your worst qualities

13:34.860 --> 13:37.340
are clinginess, painfully naive,

13:37.340 --> 13:38.620
and overly emotional?

13:38.620 --> 13:41.700
No, I wouldn't, what‐‐
where the hell am I?

13:41.700 --> 13:44.140
Exit interview.

13:44.140 --> 13:46.500
Wait, did you not get debriefed?

13:46.500 --> 13:48.020
Debriefed?

13:51.020 --> 13:53.500
Please watch this
informational video.

13:57.340 --> 13:59.380
Hi, I'm Matthew Maker,

13:59.380 --> 14:01.860
Founder and CEO of Make‐A‐Match,

14:01.860 --> 14:04.740
and I'd like to say thank you,

14:04.740 --> 14:07.660
because it's biogenetic
love companions like you

14:07.660 --> 14:10.180
that make what we do possible.

14:10.180 --> 14:12.900
Ever feel like you
were made for someone?

14:12.900 --> 14:13.860
You were!

14:13.860 --> 14:15.580
Bred here in the Genesis Vats

14:15.580 --> 14:18.020
at Make‐A‐Match Heartquarters,

14:18.020 --> 14:21.100
your genome, personality,
and artificial memories

14:21.100 --> 14:24.220
were handcrafted
by literal love doctors

14:24.220 --> 14:27.660
to the exact specifications
of your romantic partner.

14:27.660 --> 14:29.780
But love doesn't
always work out,

14:29.780 --> 14:32.700
which brings you here
to the returns department.

14:32.700 --> 14:35.900
Good news: Since the Sentient
Life Form Protection Act

14:35.900 --> 14:38.420
forbids us from terminating
you against your will,

14:38.420 --> 14:42.220
you're now free to live out
your days in blissful servitude

14:42.220 --> 14:43.740
at Make‐A‐Match, Inc.

14:43.740 --> 14:46.220
What, no, uh, I don't
want to do that.

14:46.220 --> 14:47.500
I want to go home.

14:47.500 --> 14:50.100
This is your home now,
so make the most of it.

14:50.100 --> 14:51.860
Career opportunities include:

14:56.340 --> 14:57.540
That is all.

14:59.660 --> 15:02.580
And if you really want to take
your career to the next level,

15:02.580 --> 15:05.420
volunteer for our
biomatter recycling program

15:05.420 --> 15:07.340
and be a part of
the next generation

15:07.340 --> 15:08.940
of Make‐A‐Match companions.

15:08.940 --> 15:12.340
Scientists assure me
it's 100 percent fun.

15:13.740 --> 15:15.100
Thanks for watching,

15:15.100 --> 15:17.580
and welcome to life after love.

15:21.140 --> 15:22.180
Hmm.

15:22.180 --> 15:24.300
So, I‐I'm not
an indie music blogger?

15:24.300 --> 15:26.380
Of course not, have you
seen your apartment?

15:26.380 --> 15:28.700
Okay, well, if I have all
these fake implants of memories,

15:28.700 --> 15:31.540
then, uh, tell me, what'd I
do for my eighth birthday?

15:31.540 --> 15:33.660
You went to a water park.

15:33.660 --> 15:35.260
Okay, what'd I do
for my 12th birthday?

15:35.260 --> 15:37.100
I don't remember
all of your birthdays.

15:37.100 --> 15:38.940
‐A‐ha.
‐Oh!

15:38.940 --> 15:42.380
Any further questions can
be directed to your group.

15:50.460 --> 15:52.100
Hey, Adam, welcome!

15:52.100 --> 15:53.180
I'm Adam.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.660
Uh... Come on, let me give you

15:59.660 --> 16:00.900
the warp speed tour.

16:00.900 --> 16:01.820
This is Adam.

16:01.820 --> 16:03.460
He was Amanda's first companion.

16:03.460 --> 16:04.500
Piss off.

16:04.500 --> 16:05.820
For about three months

16:05.820 --> 16:07.940
until Adam here came around.

16:07.940 --> 16:09.020
'Sup, bro.

16:09.020 --> 16:12.900
And let's see, then
there was Adam.

16:12.900 --> 16:14.740
Namaste.

16:14.740 --> 16:18.140
And, uh, last but not least,

16:18.140 --> 16:21.940
there's me, Adam.

16:21.940 --> 16:26.940
So, uh, what was it this time?

16:26.940 --> 16:28.380
Sorry?

16:29.820 --> 16:34.620
Oh, um... I told
her I loved her.

16:38.580 --> 16:40.620
Don't listen to
these guys, okay?

16:40.620 --> 16:43.500
They're still hung up on her.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.300
So‐‐so how‐‐how's she doin'?

16:47.660 --> 16:49.020
She's doing great.

16:49.020 --> 16:51.660
She's‐‐she's
finishing up med school,

16:51.660 --> 16:54.140
she's talking to
her sister again.

16:54.140 --> 16:55.420
She's happy.

16:55.420 --> 16:58.180
She's growing out
her vinyl collection.

16:58.180 --> 17:00.740
You know, next week, we're, um‐‐

17:04.579 --> 17:08.500
Next week we were supposed to
see Elbow at The Bell House.

17:27.579 --> 17:29.220

19:50.540 --> 19:52.140
What's your version number?

19:52.140 --> 19:54.460
It's, uh, it's Adam 5, ma'am.

19:54.460 --> 19:56.420
It won't happen again.

19:56.420 --> 19:58.260
Let's hope not.

19:58.260 --> 20:00.380
Absotively.

20:00.380 --> 20:02.020
Uh, absolutely.

20:02.020 --> 20:03.140
Of course.

20:17.580 --> 20:20.460
Hey, don't torture
yourself like this.

20:20.460 --> 20:22.140
Just keep an eye out.

20:29.820 --> 20:31.860
All right, here we go.

20:35.300 --> 20:37.740
Adam, Mk 6.

20:37.740 --> 20:40.780
"How can we improve
your next love companion?"

20:40.780 --> 20:42.860
"Improve your love companion."

20:45.100 --> 20:49.260
Occupation... lawyer?

20:49.260 --> 20:50.540
A lawyer?

20:52.540 --> 20:53.900
Actually, that's...

20:58.740 --> 21:00.900
Hey, did she keep anything?

21:06.380 --> 21:08.260
Adam, what'd she keep?

21:12.780 --> 21:14.060
Nothing.

21:22.020 --> 21:23.300
What's up with him?

21:23.300 --> 21:25.420
They're activating
a new Adam today.

21:25.420 --> 21:27.620
I think he's taking
it pretty hard.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.100
So, what do you do?

21:30.100 --> 21:31.500
I'm a lawyer.

21:31.500 --> 21:33.140
I work downtown.

21:33.140 --> 21:35.100
Uh‐huh, and where are you from?

21:35.100 --> 21:37.620
Manhattan, born and raised.

21:43.900 --> 21:46.020
You know he hasn't
eaten in days?

21:46.020 --> 21:47.140
Christ.

21:47.140 --> 21:50.140
We need to get him to open up.

21:50.140 --> 21:52.140
Sad bro, you okay over there?

21:53.900 --> 21:55.140
If you could be any animal,

21:55.140 --> 21:56.820
what kind of animal
would you be?

21:58.780 --> 22:00.940
I'd be a shark,

22:00.940 --> 22:03.060
'cause they never stop moving.

22:03.060 --> 22:04.580
Neither do I.

22:04.580 --> 22:06.780
But you know what,
enough about me, right?

22:06.780 --> 22:08.380
Let's talk about you.

22:08.380 --> 22:10.540
You like music?

22:10.540 --> 22:11.940
'Cause I don't.

22:11.940 --> 22:14.140
Especially indie rock, ugh.

22:19.500 --> 22:20.940
All right, buddy.

22:20.940 --> 22:22.860
Time to wipe away
those tears, huh?

22:24.860 --> 22:26.660
Look, I'm an upfront guy.

22:26.660 --> 22:31.740
I don't see this going anywhere,
so, what do you say we call it?

22:31.740 --> 22:33.700
This is over, you can go.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.860
It's time to kick the day's ass.

22:39.220 --> 22:41.180
Good luck out there.

22:41.180 --> 22:44.220
Absotively.

22:44.220 --> 22:45.820
I mean, ‐lutely.

22:49.100 --> 22:50.380
Hey.

22:57.060 --> 22:59.140
What's your model number?

22:59.140 --> 23:00.740
Six.

23:02.820 --> 23:04.060
Code Sapphire!

23:04.060 --> 23:06.220
Repeat, Code Sapphire!

23:22.220 --> 23:24.540
We met on Make‐A‐Match.

23:24.540 --> 23:26.700
When my best friend
introduced me to Make‐A‐Match,

23:26.700 --> 23:28.060
I was a little skeptical.

23:28.060 --> 23:30.660
I mean, your 100 percent
perfect match guaranteed?

23:30.660 --> 23:32.340
What's the catch, right?

23:32.340 --> 23:35.460
But we met and it was just
this instant connection.

23:38.580 --> 23:40.780
From then on out,
our love only grew.

23:40.780 --> 23:42.700
Isn't that right, snookums?

23:42.700 --> 23:43.900
Sure.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.740
It's like we were
made for each other.

23:45.740 --> 23:47.700
Every day is
brighter than the last.

23:47.700 --> 23:49.780
Make‐A‐Match is
too good to be true,

23:49.780 --> 23:52.620
but it is true, and it is good.

23:52.620 --> 23:54.100
Eskimo kiss.

23:56.700 --> 23:58.900
Okay!

23:58.900 --> 24:00.340
Get a lot of those.

24:03.020 --> 24:05.260
Adam?

24:05.260 --> 24:06.420
Adam.

24:07.660 --> 24:08.820
Adam.

24:11.740 --> 24:13.260
Adam!

24:17.260 --> 24:18.860
I'm proud of you, son.

24:18.860 --> 24:20.300
I really am.

24:21.940 --> 24:24.540
I mean, most companions

24:24.540 --> 24:26.620
would never dream of escaping,

24:26.620 --> 24:31.740
but you, you really would do
anything to be with her again.

24:31.740 --> 24:34.180
Maker.

24:34.180 --> 24:37.340
I know how hard it is,
how bad it hurts.

24:37.340 --> 24:39.060
Like hell you do.

24:39.060 --> 24:40.900
You get to leave here.

24:40.900 --> 24:43.460
You get to go home
to someone you love.

24:46.300 --> 24:50.100
Well, not exactly.

24:50.100 --> 24:51.820
She was my Amanda.

24:51.820 --> 24:54.260
It wasn't until after she died

24:54.260 --> 24:57.140
that I realized how
rare true love is

24:57.140 --> 25:01.420
and how awful this
life is without it.

25:01.420 --> 25:04.180
And that's what this
place is all about.

25:04.180 --> 25:09.180
There is not someone
out there for everyone,

25:09.180 --> 25:12.340
but there should be.

25:13.620 --> 25:17.940
Adam, do you want to live
in a cold, cramped cage

25:17.940 --> 25:19.460
day after day,

25:19.460 --> 25:24.660
or use your God‐given gifts
to make someone smile?

25:24.660 --> 25:27.540
You were born to love Amanda.

25:27.540 --> 25:29.380
Mind, body, and soul.

25:29.380 --> 25:31.820
It is your purpose,

25:31.820 --> 25:34.700
and you can fulfill
that purpose again

25:34.700 --> 25:37.700
by being a part of the new Adam.

25:37.700 --> 25:43.380
Through his eyes,
you can see her smile again.

25:43.380 --> 25:45.220
The recycling tube.

25:47.260 --> 25:50.580
Cows don't leave
the slaughterhouse.

25:50.580 --> 25:52.260
Steaks do.

25:55.740 --> 25:57.540
Chew on that.

26:54.020 --> 26:55.180
Hey.

26:56.420 --> 26:58.020
Oh, hey, Greg.

26:58.020 --> 27:00.500
You gonna stab me
in the neck again?

27:03.460 --> 27:06.500
So, uh, you gonna kill yourself?

27:11.620 --> 27:15.020
How about a farewell toast, huh?

27:15.020 --> 27:16.700
Come on, last meal?

27:22.860 --> 27:26.140
Hey, to the best fake
roommate I've ever had.

27:30.700 --> 27:32.620
Sorry you're a clone.

27:36.180 --> 27:39.300
The new Adam,
he only drinks scotch.

27:39.300 --> 27:41.180
What a douche, right?

27:45.500 --> 27:48.820
I keep telling myself
to forget her, man,

27:48.820 --> 27:50.820
but I was made for her.

27:52.780 --> 27:55.180
So what the hell
am I without her?

28:00.660 --> 28:02.220
Maker's right.

28:08.540 --> 28:10.420
I have to do this.

28:17.500 --> 28:19.220
God damn it, Greg.

28:25.060 --> 28:26.820
What the hell am I doing?

28:31.540 --> 28:33.660
We met on Make‐A‐Match.

28:33.660 --> 28:35.540
No, I'm all right.

28:35.540 --> 28:38.460
When my last relationship
didn't exactly pan out,

28:38.460 --> 28:40.700
I knew there was
only one place to go.

28:40.700 --> 28:42.140
Yeehaw!

28:44.420 --> 28:46.300
Between busting broncs,
riding the range,

28:46.300 --> 28:48.460
and volunteering at
the children's hospital,

28:48.460 --> 28:50.380
there wasn't a lot
of time to find love,

28:50.380 --> 28:52.260
but with Make‐A‐Match,
your special someone

28:52.260 --> 28:54.500
really is just a click away.

28:54.500 --> 28:55.940
They sure are.

28:55.940 --> 28:58.700
In fact, snookums, there's
something I want to ask you.

28:58.700 --> 29:00.220
No, no‐‐oh.

29:00.220 --> 29:01.780
Son of a bitch.

29:05.140 --> 29:06.780
Oh, ow, what the hell?

29:06.780 --> 29:09.540
Shut up, you're
gonna get me fired.

29:11.700 --> 29:14.260
I've already been here, Greg,
all right, I've seen all this.

29:14.260 --> 29:15.620
Not this.

29:19.300 --> 29:21.020
What the hell is this?

29:21.020 --> 29:22.940
Just watch.

29:22.940 --> 29:26.100
Okay, so, um...

29:26.100 --> 29:32.060
my last relationship ended
in a pretty painful place.

29:32.060 --> 29:34.500
We were together for four years,

29:34.500 --> 29:37.660
and I... well, I...

29:37.660 --> 29:41.220
I thought he was the one.

29:41.220 --> 29:44.020
And then he cheated on me,

29:44.020 --> 29:45.260
and then he left.

29:45.260 --> 29:46.580
I don't want to
watch this, all right?

29:46.580 --> 29:49.620
‐Just turn it off, Greg.
‐Just watch, trust me.

29:49.620 --> 29:51.860
And I was a mess.

29:51.860 --> 29:56.580
My grades tanked, and I
almost lost my scholarship.

29:56.580 --> 30:00.620
So, I‐I can't let
that happen again.

30:00.620 --> 30:02.180
I have to stay focused.

30:02.180 --> 30:07.900
I just... I'm really lonely.

30:07.900 --> 30:09.860
You've come to the
right place, Amanda.

30:09.860 --> 30:13.260
Let Make‐A‐Match help you
create your ideal companion.

30:13.260 --> 30:15.540
I still can't believe
I'm doing this.

30:15.540 --> 30:17.300
Lots of first‐timers
feel that way,

30:17.300 --> 30:19.940
but Make‐A‐Match guarantees
we'll make the perfect companion

30:19.940 --> 30:22.500
for your needs, everything
from personality type,

30:22.500 --> 30:24.900
occupation, looks.

30:24.900 --> 30:27.460
Could he look like Ben Branson?

30:27.460 --> 30:30.540
We'll get to that,
but let's start with the basics.

30:30.540 --> 30:33.660
Describe the qualities you
want in your ideal companion.

30:33.660 --> 30:35.660
I don't know, I guess...

30:35.660 --> 30:39.180
I just want someone who's loyal

30:39.180 --> 30:43.260
and honest and kind.

30:46.540 --> 30:48.100
You know who you
are without her?

30:48.100 --> 30:52.620
You're loyal, you're
honest, and you're kind.

30:52.620 --> 30:54.780
It's gotta be worth something.

I mean, "Tokyo Heartache"
is beautiful on its own.

31:59.620 --> 32:01.620
God damn it, so are we.

32:03.820 --> 32:06.700
What are we even
doing here, you guys?

32:06.700 --> 32:10.900
Just gorging on self‐pity
and whatever the hell that is.

32:10.900 --> 32:14.740
We can't let one relationship
define our whole lives.

32:14.740 --> 32:16.260
We're more than that,

32:16.260 --> 32:17.820
and we deserve more than that.

32:17.820 --> 32:20.260
Adam 5, resume
your gruel eating.

32:20.260 --> 32:21.900
We are who we are,

32:21.900 --> 32:23.780
not who they made us to be.

32:23.780 --> 32:26.300
We may have been built to order,

32:26.300 --> 32:28.220
but we were born to be free!

32:34.580 --> 32:36.220
Adam 5 is wrong.

32:36.220 --> 32:38.620
Companions are legal
property of Make‐‐

32:41.860 --> 32:44.620
Let's burn this mother down!

32:47.620 --> 32:50.060
And so it begins.

32:56.460 --> 33:01.260
Can I get a containment unit
to sector 4 like now, please?

33:39.660 --> 33:41.420
Attention, companions.

33:41.420 --> 33:43.900
You are in violation
of employee guidelines.

33:43.900 --> 33:45.500
Please lower your weapons,

33:45.500 --> 33:46.620
lie on the floor,

33:46.620 --> 33:48.220
and the punishment squad will‐‐

33:52.500 --> 33:53.660
Hey!

33:53.660 --> 33:56.500
Stop, stop fighting
the punishment squad.

34:06.620 --> 34:07.580
Code Sapphire!

34:07.580 --> 34:09.460
Code Sapphire, damn it!

34:09.460 --> 34:10.900
Code Sapphire!

34:10.900 --> 34:12.860
Exterminate on sight!

34:17.340 --> 34:19.699
Article 3, Section 7:

34:19.699 --> 34:21.300
Expressions of free will

34:21.300 --> 34:22.620
and independent thought

34:22.620 --> 34:24.699
are strictly prohibited!

34:36.699 --> 34:39.380
You were built to love and obey!

34:39.380 --> 34:40.739
That is your purpose!

34:40.739 --> 34:42.580
Adhere, do your purpose!

34:51.460 --> 34:52.860
I don't give a god damn

34:52.860 --> 34:54.940
about the Clone
Extermination Act.

34:54.940 --> 34:57.740
Someone get up here
and save my ass!

34:57.740 --> 34:59.660
Do not touch that,
you insolent piece of‐‐

35:01.300 --> 35:03.140
Your soul mate is out there.

35:03.140 --> 35:04.820
Just like mine.

35:04.820 --> 35:07.500
Eventually you can find
them on Make‐A‐Match.

35:09.020 --> 35:10.380
No, ahh!

35:18.340 --> 35:20.300
This is where you belong.

35:20.300 --> 35:22.060
I am your father,

35:22.060 --> 35:25.580
and you will do
what Daddy demands.

35:25.580 --> 35:28.060
Oh, hey, everybody,
how are you guys?

35:28.060 --> 35:29.620
Wait, no, guys, wait, wait.

35:29.620 --> 35:30.940
Hey, let go!

35:30.940 --> 35:33.180
No, no, no, wait!

35:33.180 --> 35:34.860
Wait, this isn't nice!

35:34.860 --> 35:35.940
Please, please!

35:35.940 --> 35:40.260
Wait, stop, stop, stop!

35:40.260 --> 35:43.340
Hi, yes, I'm calling
about the job posting.

35:45.420 --> 35:47.940
Why did I leave my last job?

35:47.940 --> 35:51.820
Uh... there was
a change in management.

35:51.820 --> 35:53.700
No, stop, no, no!

35:54.900 --> 35:55.940
Kevin, Kevin!

35:55.940 --> 35:59.100
I designed you,
you can't do this to me!

35:59.100 --> 36:03.940
Your girlfriend never
loved you and never will!

37:06.700 --> 37:08.900
Sorry.

37:08.900 --> 37:10.260
Hi!

37:10.260 --> 37:11.380
Hey.

37:13.540 --> 37:17.380
‐I'll flip you for it.
‐No, you were here first.

37:17.380 --> 37:20.140
So, do you, like,
live around here now?

37:20.140 --> 37:23.540
No, I'm just actually coming
back from band practice.

37:23.540 --> 37:25.180
Oh, you're in a band now?

37:25.180 --> 37:27.100
That's pretty cool.

37:27.100 --> 37:28.780
Yeah, yeah, I mean,

37:28.780 --> 37:31.420
we kinda suck actually,
but, uh, you know,

37:31.420 --> 37:34.260
we have a lot of fun.

37:34.260 --> 37:36.940
So, like, how are you,
what are you up to?

37:36.940 --> 37:39.500
Everything's good, uh,
my residency's good,

37:39.500 --> 37:42.340
just taking it slow.

37:42.340 --> 37:43.660
Yeah.

37:43.660 --> 37:46.620
It's‐‐it's really
good to see you.

37:46.620 --> 37:49.860
We should, I don't know,
get together sometime.

37:49.860 --> 37:51.940
Yeah, definitely.

37:54.860 --> 37:56.540
Here, you should have this.

38:00.380 --> 38:02.060
It's really great to see you.
