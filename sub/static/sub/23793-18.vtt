00:34.367 --> 00:35.800
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:35.867 --> 00:36.900
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:36.967 --> 00:37.800
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:37.867 --> 00:38.900
US.

00:38.967 --> 00:40.266
JUST TIME FOR A QUICK RECAP OF

00:40.333 --> 00:40.900
THE WEEK.

00:40.967 --> 00:42.200
AND WE BEGIN WITH THE TRUMP

00:42.266 --> 00:43.000
ADMINISTRATION'S ONGOING

00:43.066 --> 00:44.633
SCANDALS, WHICH WE'VE BEEN

00:44.700 --> 00:46.033
CALLING "STUPID WATERGATE,"

00:46.100 --> 00:47.133
SOMETHING WITH THE POTENTIAL

00:47.200 --> 00:48.367
GRAVITY OF WATERGATE IF THE

00:48.433 --> 00:49.400
ENTIRE WHITE HOUSE WAS ON

00:49.467 --> 00:50.767
BATH SALTS AND NIXON WAS A

00:50.834 --> 00:51.400
RACCOON WITH HIS HEAD STUCK IN A

00:51.467 --> 00:56.467
JAR OF PEANUT BUTTER.

00:56.533 --> 00:57.300
WELL, THIS WEEK, IT SEEMS LIKE

00:57.367 --> 00:58.066
INVESTIGATORS STARTED CLOSING IN

00:58.133 --> 00:59.033
ON THE TRUMP TEAM, AND NOT JUST

00:59.100 --> 01:00.934
METAPHORICALLY.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.166
>> A POLITICAL ALERT FOR YOU.

01:02.233 --> 01:03.300
DONALD TRUMP JR. AND SPECIAL

01:03.367 --> 01:05.133
COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER WERE FEET

01:05.200 --> 01:06.667
AWAY FROM EACH OTHER.

01:06.734 --> 01:07.667
LOOK AT THIS IMAGE.

01:07.734 --> 01:08.667
THEY WERE WAITING FOR A FLIGHT

01:08.734 --> 01:09.800
YESTERDAY.

01:09.867 --> 01:11.000
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

01:11.066 --> 01:14.266
THAT HAPPENED.

01:14.333 --> 01:15.700
AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHO WAS

01:15.767 --> 01:18.400
MORE UNCOMFORTABLE ON THAT

01:18.467 --> 01:19.100
FLIGHT, DON JR. OR

01:19.166 --> 01:20.033
ROBERT MUELLER, IT'S

01:20.100 --> 01:21.100
ACTUALLY A TRICK QUESTION.

01:21.166 --> 01:22.333
IT'S EVERYONE ON ANY FLIGHT WITH

01:22.400 --> 01:23.300
DON JR. EVER, BECAUSE IT TURNS

01:23.367 --> 01:24.467
OUT THAT "MY SEAT MATE SMELLS

01:24.533 --> 01:25.500
LIKE AXE BODY SPRAY AND

01:25.567 --> 01:26.467
MISPLACED CONFIDENCE" IS NOT A

01:26.533 --> 01:28.433
GOOD ENOUGH REASON TO CHANGE

01:28.500 --> 01:29.967
SEATS.

01:30.033 --> 01:30.934
NOW, THERE WAS A SERIES OF

01:31.000 --> 01:31.834
POTENTIALLY DAMAGING REVELATIONS

01:31.900 --> 01:33.300
THIS WEEK, COURTESY OF THE

01:33.367 --> 01:34.834
PRESIDENT'S FORMER LAWYER,

01:34.900 --> 01:35.700
MICHAEL COHEN, WHOSE VERY FACE

01:35.767 --> 01:37.233
NOW PERMANENTLY ASKS THE

01:37.300 --> 01:38.433
QUESTION "IS THIS THE DAY I GO

01:38.500 --> 01:43.667
TO JAIL?"

01:43.734 --> 01:44.500
AND THE REVELATIONS BEGAN ON

01:44.567 --> 01:46.300
TUESDAY WITH THIS.

01:46.367 --> 01:47.266
>> THERE ARE TAPES.

01:47.333 --> 01:48.166
THE FBI HAS A SECRET RECORDING

01:48.233 --> 01:51.800
OF PRESIDENT TRUMP SPEAKING WITH

01:51.867 --> 01:52.467
HIS ONE-TIME FIXER,

01:52.533 --> 01:53.834
MICHAEL COHEN, ABOUT POTENTIAL

01:53.900 --> 01:55.033
PAYMENTS TO SILENCE FORMER

01:55.100 --> 01:56.767
PLAYBOY MODEL KAREN McDOUGAL IN

01:56.834 --> 01:57.467
LATE 2016, JUST MONTHS BEFORE HE

01:57.533 --> 02:00.400
WAS ELECTED.

02:00.467 --> 02:01.533
>> John: WOW.

02:01.600 --> 02:02.800
NOW, HISTORICALLY, "THERE ARE

02:02.867 --> 02:03.734
TAPES" HASN'T WORKED OUT WELL

02:03.800 --> 02:05.033
FOR PRESIDENTS.

02:05.100 --> 02:06.400
IT'S ONE OF THOSE PHRASES THAT

02:06.467 --> 02:08.467
IS UNIVERSALLY FOREBODING, LIKE

02:08.533 --> 02:10.166
"THE VIRUS IS AIRBORNE" OR

02:10.233 --> 02:11.567
"RONAN FARROW IS WORKING ON AN

02:11.633 --> 02:13.867
ARTICLE ABOUT YOU."

02:13.934 --> 02:15.300
NOW, THE TAPES FEATURE TRUMP AND

02:15.367 --> 02:16.233
COHEN DISCUSSING A PLAN TO KEEP

02:16.300 --> 02:17.767
McDOUGAL'S STORY FROM BECOMING

02:17.834 --> 02:19.033
PUBLIC, WHICH IS INTERESTING,

02:19.100 --> 02:20.133
BECAUSE REMEMBER, TRUMP HAD

02:20.200 --> 02:21.600
PREVIOUSLY DENIED ANY KNOWLEDGE

02:21.667 --> 02:22.900
OF THE SITUATION AND ALSO DENIED

02:22.967 --> 02:25.000
THE AFFAIR ITSELF.

02:25.066 --> 02:26.767
SO THIS COULD BE A PROBLEM FOR

02:26.834 --> 02:28.467
MULTIPLE REASONS, FROM IT BEING

02:28.533 --> 02:30.400
A POTENTIAL CAMPAIGN FINANCE

02:30.467 --> 02:32.033
VIOLATION TO THE EMBARRASSMENT

02:32.100 --> 02:33.000
IT CAUSES TRUMP'S WIFE --

02:33.066 --> 02:34.934
ALTHOUGH GIVEN THAT SHE JUST

02:35.000 --> 02:35.567
RELEASED A STATEMENT THAT SHE IS

02:35.633 --> 02:37.133
ALLOWED TO WATCH ANY CHANNEL SHE

02:37.200 --> 02:39.300
WANTS, THAT MARRIAGE APPEARS TO

02:39.367 --> 02:43.433
BE ROCK-SOLID.

02:43.500 --> 02:44.533
BUT COHEN WASN'T DONE, BECAUSE

02:44.600 --> 02:45.900
ON THURSDAY, HE DROPPED A SECOND

02:45.967 --> 02:48.033
BOMBSHELL.

02:48.100 --> 02:50.200
>> TRUMP'S FORMER PERSONAL

02:50.266 --> 02:52.367
LAWYER, MICHAEL COHEN, CLAIMS

02:52.433 --> 02:53.900
MR. TRUMP KNEW IN ADVANCE ABOUT

02:53.967 --> 02:55.900
THAT JUNE 2016 MEETING IN

02:55.967 --> 03:03.734
TRUMP TOWER, THE MEETING WHERE

03:03.800 --> 03:05.033
THE TRUMP TEAM EXPECTED RUSSIANS

03:05.100 --> 03:06.300
TO DELIVER CAMPAIGN DIRT ON

03:06.367 --> 03:07.166
HILLARY CLINTON.

03:07.233 --> 03:08.066
>> John: NOW, THAT IS

03:08.133 --> 03:08.900
POTENTIALLY HUGE, AND ALSO,

03:08.967 --> 03:09.633
SOMEHOW, COMPLETELY

03:09.700 --> 03:10.333
UNSURPRISING.

03:10.400 --> 03:11.233
BECAUSE DEEP DOWN, WE ALL

03:11.300 --> 03:12.066
ASSUMED THAT WAS THE CASE

03:12.133 --> 03:12.900
ANYWAY.

03:12.967 --> 03:13.767
"BREAKING NEWS, THE PRESIDENT

03:13.834 --> 03:14.767
ACTUALLY KNEW ABOUT A MEETING

03:14.834 --> 03:15.567
THAT INVOLVED HIS SON, HIS

03:15.633 --> 03:16.633
SON-IN-LAW, AND HIS CAMPAIGN

03:16.700 --> 03:17.533
MANAGER DISCUSSING DIRT ABOUT

03:17.600 --> 03:18.734
HIS GREATEST ENEMY THAT TOOK

03:18.800 --> 03:20.000
PLACE WHERE HE LIVED AND WORKED

03:20.066 --> 03:22.100
IN A BUILDING WHICH HAS HIS

03:22.166 --> 03:28.500
FUCKING NAME ON IT.

03:28.567 --> 03:33.333
AND, LOOK, IF MICHAEL COHEN'S

03:33.400 --> 03:34.734
REVELATIONS WERE NOT ENOUGH,

03:34.800 --> 03:35.400
THIS WEEK BROUGHT ONE MORE

03:35.467 --> 03:36.100
DEVELOPMENT, AS IT WAS REPORTED

03:36.166 --> 03:36.867
THAT ROBERT MUELLER IS NOW

03:36.934 --> 03:37.567
LOOKING INTO WHETHER TRUMP'S

03:37.633 --> 03:38.300
TWEETS CONSTITUTE OBSTRUCTION OF

03:38.367 --> 03:39.400
JUSTICE, A QUESTION ON WHICH HIS

03:39.467 --> 03:40.000
LAWYER, RUDY GIULIANI, WEIGHED

03:40.066 --> 03:45.100
IN JUST THIS MORNING.

03:45.166 --> 03:45.834
>> OBSTRUCTION BY TWEET IS NOT

03:45.900 --> 03:46.600
SOMETHING THAT I THINK WORKS

03:46.667 --> 03:47.500
REAL WELL.

03:47.567 --> 03:48.367
GENERALLY, OBSTRUCTION IS

03:48.433 --> 03:49.500
SECRET, IT'S CLANDESTINE, IT'S

03:49.567 --> 03:50.367
CORRUPT.

03:50.433 --> 03:51.367
YOU DON'T WANT THE EVIDENCE OUT

03:51.433 --> 03:52.166
IN THE PUBLIC SO IT CAN BE USED

03:52.233 --> 03:53.567
AGAINST YOU.

03:53.633 --> 03:55.667
>> John: NOW, THAT IS TRUE.

03:55.734 --> 03:56.633
IT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY STUPID TO

03:56.700 --> 03:58.100
DO THIS COMPLETELY OUT IN THE

03:58.166 --> 04:00.433
OPEN.

04:00.500 --> 04:03.133
OR -- OR IT COULD BE BRILLIANT.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.800
BECAUSE JUST THINK ABOUT IT:

04:04.867 --> 04:05.567
IT'S INNATELY HARD TO BELIEVE

04:05.633 --> 04:06.734
SOMETHING IS A CRIME WHEN IT'S

04:06.800 --> 04:08.033
DONE LOUDLY AND BLATANTLY RIGHT

04:08.100 --> 04:09.567
IN FRONT OF YOU.

04:09.633 --> 04:11.133
IF YOU SEE SOMEONE BREAK A

04:11.200 --> 04:12.633
CAR WINDOW IN BROAD DAYLIGHT,

04:12.700 --> 04:13.333
GET IN, AND THEN DRIVE AWAY,

04:13.400 --> 04:15.433
PART OF YOU IS GOING, "I GUESS

04:15.500 --> 04:17.700
THAT GUY MUST OWN THAT CAR."

04:17.767 --> 04:18.600
BUT HE DIDN'T.

04:18.667 --> 04:19.767
THAT WAS JUST A VERY BAD

04:19.834 --> 04:21.200
CAR THIEF WHO MIGHT JUST BE

04:21.266 --> 04:21.900
STUPID ENOUGH TO GET AWAY WITH

04:21.967 --> 04:22.967
THAT.

04:23.033 --> 04:23.834
AND THE DEPRESSING THING IS,

04:23.900 --> 04:25.000
THAT MIGHT BE WHAT IS HAPPENING

04:25.066 --> 04:26.066
HERE.

04:26.133 --> 04:28.433
BUT NOW, LET'S MOVE ON TO

05:35.800 --> 05:36.900

05:36.967 --> 05:40.300

05:40.367 --> 05:41.467

05:41.533 --> 05:42.800
THEY'VE BEEN STRUGGLING.

05:42.867 --> 05:45.200
CONCERNS ABOUT PRIVACY HAVE

05:45.266 --> 05:46.100
GOTTEN SO INTENSE.

05:46.166 --> 05:47.100

07:22.633 --> 07:23.834
AND, UM, I MEAN, THIS IS ONE OF

07:23.900 --> 07:24.800
THE THINGS THAT'S REALLY MAGICAL

07:24.867 --> 07:26.066
ABOUT VIRTUAL REALITY IS, YOU

07:26.133 --> 07:27.400
CAN GET THE FEELING THAT YOU'RE

07:27.467 --> 07:28.333
REALLY IN A PLACE.

07:28.400 --> 07:29.300
IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE IN THE SAME

07:29.367 --> 07:30.133
PLACE AND WE'RE MAKING EYE

07:30.200 --> 07:37.000
CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER.

07:37.066 --> 07:37.667
>> WE COULD HIGH-FIVE IF WE

07:37.734 --> 07:38.667
WANTED TO.

07:38.734 --> 07:39.433
>> WE CAN EVEN HIGH-FIVE.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.400
I MEAN, THIS IS -- WE'RE NOW

07:40.467 --> 07:41.200
LOOKING AROUND, AND IT FEELS

07:41.266 --> 07:42.066
LIKE WE'RE REALLY HERE IN

07:42.133 --> 07:42.867
PUERTO RICO, WHERE IT'S

07:42.934 --> 07:43.667
OBVIOUSLY A TOUGH PLACE TO GET

07:43.734 --> 07:44.633
TO NOW, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

07:44.700 --> 07:45.433
REALLY SUFFERING WITH THE

07:45.500 --> 07:46.800
AFTERMATH OF THE HURRICANES.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.233
>> John: OKAY, SO JUST A SMALL

07:48.300 --> 07:50.066
TIP FOR FUTURE VIRTUAL REALITY

07:50.133 --> 07:57.834
DEMONSTRATIONS: IF YOU FEEL LIKE

07:57.900 --> 07:59.367
YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO GO TO A

07:59.433 --> 08:00.533
PLACE WHERE SOMETHING HORRIFIC

08:00.600 --> 08:02.767
JUST HAPPENED, AT THE VERY

08:02.834 --> 08:03.700
LEAST, DON'T HAVE YOUR AVATARS

08:03.767 --> 08:04.200
BE SMILING.

08:04.266 --> 08:04.900
THAT'S LIKE GOING TO THE

08:04.967 --> 08:05.967
KILLING FIELDS AND THROWING ON

08:06.033 --> 08:06.400
THE DOG FACE FILTER.

08:06.467 --> 08:07.100
THAT IS NEITHER THE TIME NOR THE

08:07.166 --> 08:07.834
PLACE FOR LOOKING LIKE A

08:07.900 --> 08:08.800
SEXY PUPPY.

08:08.867 --> 08:09.700
I DON'T KNOW WHEN EXACTLY IS,

08:09.767 --> 08:11.400
BUT IT'S NOT FUCKING THEN.

08:11.467 --> 08:12.467
NOW, PUBLIC OPINION OF FACEBOOK

08:12.533 --> 08:14.834
HAS CLEARLY NEVER BEEN LOWER,

08:14.900 --> 08:15.767
AND IT SEEMS THAT ZUCKERBERG AND

08:15.834 --> 08:17.967
HIS COMPANY COULD USE A FRIEND

08:18.033 --> 08:18.967
RIGHT NOW.

08:19.033 --> 08:19.934
NOT A FACEBOOK FRIEND, OF

08:20.000 --> 08:20.934
COURSE, A REAL FRIEND.

08:21.033 --> 08:22.300
ONE WHO'LL DO MORE THAN

08:22.367 --> 08:23.200
MINDLESSLY "LIKE" EVERYTHING

08:23.266 --> 08:24.367
THEY DO.

08:24.433 --> 08:25.200
THEY NEED A FRIEND WHO

08:25.266 --> 08:26.467
UNDERSTANDS WHO THEY REALLY ARE:

08:26.533 --> 08:29.967
A SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM DISGUISED

08:30.033 --> 08:30.934
AS A HIGH SCHOOL REUNION.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.100
A FRIEND WHO THINKS THEIR ADS

08:32.166 --> 08:35.800
SHOULD BE UP FRONT ABOUT THIS

08:35.867 --> 08:36.400
AND WHO, IN FACT, HAS ALREADY

08:36.467 --> 08:38.266
PRODUCED A VERSION OF WHAT THAT

08:38.333 --> 08:38.834
AD MIGHT LOOK LIKE.

08:38.900 --> 08:39.700
>> YOU CAME HERE FOR THE

08:39.767 --> 08:40.934
FRIENDS.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.500
YOU GOT TO KNOW THE FRIENDS OF

08:42.567 --> 08:43.100
YOUR FRIENDS.

08:43.166 --> 08:43.900
WE CAME HERE FOR YOUR DATA AND

08:43.967 --> 08:45.100
THE DATA OF EVERYONE YOU HAVE

08:45.166 --> 08:47.033
EVER COME INTO CONTACT WITH.

08:47.100 --> 08:48.133
FROM YOUR OLD FRIENDS FROM

08:48.200 --> 08:49.300
MIDDLE SCHOOL TO YOUR GRANDMA TO

08:49.367 --> 08:50.800
YOUR GRANDMA'S FRIENDS FROM

08:50.867 --> 08:52.233
MIDDLE SCHOOL.

08:52.300 --> 08:55.200
AND YOUR DATA ENABLED US TO MAKE

08:55.266 --> 08:59.133
A FUCK TON OF AD MONEY FROM

08:59.200 --> 09:00.233
CORPORATIONS, APP DEVELOPERS,

09:00.300 --> 09:02.233
AND POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS, AND WE

09:02.300 --> 09:03.100
DISCOVERED YOUR UNCLE USED TO

09:03.166 --> 09:03.967
HAVE TIES TO THE KLAN.

09:04.033 --> 09:05.433
AND GUESS WHAT?

09:05.500 --> 09:07.266
WE DISCOVERED WE COULD MAKE A

09:07.333 --> 09:07.900
FUCK TON OF MONEY OFF THAT SHIT

09:07.967 --> 09:09.934
TOO.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.266
GUYS, WE WERE MAKING SO MUCH

09:11.333 --> 09:12.133
MONEY OFF OF YOU, YOU DON'T EVEN

09:12.200 --> 09:13.166
UNDERSTAND.

09:13.233 --> 09:14.300
BUT THEN YOU FOUND OUT ABOUT IT,

09:14.367 --> 09:18.867
AND WE HAD TO TESTIFY AND ISSUE

09:18.934 --> 09:20.100
BULLSHIT APOLOGY ADS.

09:20.166 --> 09:21.367
ALSO, WE COULD LOSE

09:21.433 --> 09:27.200
$120 BILLION.

09:27.266 --> 09:27.934
BUT HERE'S THE THING.

09:28.033 --> 09:28.667
NOTHING'S REALLY GOING TO

09:28.734 --> 09:29.266
CHANGE.

09:29.333 --> 09:30.233
WE'VE GOT YOUR DATA.

09:30.300 --> 09:30.867
WE'VE GOT YOUR FRIENDS.

09:30.934 --> 09:31.500
AND, REALLY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING

09:31.567 --> 09:32.400
TO GO?

09:32.467 --> 09:33.333
FRIENDSTER?

09:33.400 --> 09:34.166
FUCK YOU.

09:34.233 --> 09:34.934
THAT IS WHY WE ARE GOING TO KEEP

09:35.000 --> 09:35.667
FINDING SUBTLE WAYS TO VIOLATE

09:35.734 --> 09:36.467
YOUR PRIVACY, SO WE CAN CARRY ON

09:36.533 --> 09:37.433
DOING WHAT THIS PLACE WAS BUILT

09:37.500 --> 09:38.433
FOR: FUNCTIONING AS A HAVEN FOR

09:38.500 --> 09:41.533
RACIST TROLLS, A WAY FOR YOU TO

09:41.600 --> 09:42.500
FEEL JEALOUS OF

09:42.567 --> 09:43.467
PEOPLE YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IN

09:43.533 --> 09:46.934
YEARS, AND A PLACE FOR YOU TO

09:47.000 --> 09:47.667
FRITTER YOUR LIFE AWAY WATCHING

09:47.734 --> 09:48.633
VIDEOS OF CATS EATING CORN, DOGS

09:48.700 --> 09:50.066
RIDING HORSES, AND KIDS BEATING

09:50.133 --> 09:50.700
THE SHIT OUT OF EACH OTHER, ALL

09:50.767 --> 09:51.900
WHILE WE MAKE AN UNGODLY AMOUNT

09:51.967 --> 09:54.367
OF MONEY.

09:54.433 --> 09:55.266
FACEBOOK.

09:55.333 --> 09:59.333
WE OWN WHO YOU ARE.

09:59.400 --> 10:03.066
>> John: MOVING ON.

10:03.133 --> 10:05.400
SO OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT

10:05.467 --> 10:06.600
CONCERNS SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN

10:06.667 --> 10:08.100
THE WORKPLACE, WHICH YOU MAY

10:08.166 --> 10:09.467
KNOW FROM ITS SUPPORTING ROLE ON

10:09.533 --> 10:10.433
THE HIT SHOW "MAD MEN."

10:10.500 --> 10:11.900
AND, LOOK, WHO BETTER TO TALK

10:11.967 --> 10:13.533
ABOUT IT THAN ME, A MAN?

10:13.600 --> 10:16.200
"WHEN WILL THE MALE PERSPECTIVE

10:16.266 --> 10:17.300
ON HARASSMENT BE HEARD?"

10:17.367 --> 10:18.266
THE PUBLIC HAS BEEN CRYING OUT.

10:18.333 --> 10:19.767
WELL, WAIT NO LONGER.

10:19.834 --> 10:21.367
TONIGHT IS THE NIGHT.

10:21.433 --> 10:22.767
WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH

10:22.834 --> 10:23.734
WORKPLACE HARASSMENT FOR

10:23.800 --> 10:24.767
DECADES, AS DEMONSTRATED BY THIS

10:24.834 --> 10:25.900
UNFORTUNATELY TITLED TRAINING

10:25.967 --> 10:29.867
VIDEO FROM 1981.

10:29.934 --> 10:31.934
>> GOOD OLD SEX.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.100
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT, HUH?

10:34.166 --> 10:35.233
EVERYTHING, AS A MATTER OF FACT,

10:35.300 --> 10:36.500
WHEN IT'S UNWELCOME AND WHEN IT

10:36.567 --> 10:38.834
OCCURS AT WORK.

10:38.900 --> 10:40.400
>> John: OKAY, SO FIRST, NEVER

10:40.467 --> 10:42.500
CALL IT "GOOD OLD SEX."

10:42.567 --> 10:43.533
YOU SOUND LIKE A GRANDFATHER

10:43.600 --> 10:44.367
EXPLAINING THE BIRDS AND THE

10:44.433 --> 10:45.400
BEES.

10:45.467 --> 10:46.800
"LET'S TALK ABOUT GOOD OLD SEX,

10:46.867 --> 10:52.533
TIGER.

10:52.600 --> 10:53.700
'CAUSE SOMETIMES POP-POP LIKES

10:53.767 --> 10:54.734
TO STICK THE OL' SPATULA IN

10:54.800 --> 10:55.233
MEEMAW'S EASY-BAKE OVEN.

10:55.300 --> 10:56.200
YOU GET IT.

10:56.266 --> 10:57.000
YOU GET IT."

10:57.066 --> 10:57.900
THE KID GETS IT.

10:57.967 --> 10:59.133
BUT THE FACT IS, STORE-BRAND

10:59.200 --> 11:00.133
TED DANSON IS RIGHT.

11:00.200 --> 11:01.000
WORKPLACE HARASSMENT IS

11:01.066 --> 11:02.100
SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO DISCUSS,

11:02.166 --> 11:03.033
AND IT'S BEEN IN THE HEADLINES

11:03.100 --> 11:03.900
AGAIN THIS WEEK WITH

11:03.967 --> 11:06.300
"THE NEW YORKER'S" EXPOSE ABOUT

11:06.367 --> 11:07.700
CBS AND LES MOONVES COMING HOT

11:07.767 --> 11:10.133
ON THE HEELS OF SIMILAR

11:10.200 --> 11:11.266
INVESTIGATIONS INTO EVERYONE

11:11.333 --> 11:12.767
FROM HARVEY WEINSTEIN TO

11:12.834 --> 11:13.967
CHARLIE ROSE TO SPONGEBOB, WHO

11:14.033 --> 11:15.433
FIVE DIFFERENT EMPLOYEES ACCUSED

11:15.500 --> 11:16.867
OF BEING UNABLE TO KEEP HIS

11:16.934 --> 11:18.700
SPONGE DICK IN HIS SQUARE PANTS.

11:18.767 --> 11:21.066
YOU'RE A MONSTER.

11:21.133 --> 11:22.900
AND, LOOK, WHENEVER THE SUBJECT

11:22.967 --> 11:24.734
OF WORKPLACE HARASSMENT COMES

11:24.800 --> 11:26.800
UP, YOU CAN BET ON ONE THING:

11:26.867 --> 11:28.433
MEN GETTING VERY NERVOUS.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.467
>> I THINK RIGHT NOW MEN ARE

11:30.533 --> 11:32.367
SCARED, AND YOU CAN GET TO THE

11:32.433 --> 11:33.700
POINT WHERE WOMEN ARE GONNA BE

11:33.767 --> 11:35.500
DENIED OPPORTUNITIES TO ADVANCE

11:35.567 --> 11:36.867
IN CORPORATE AMERICA 'CAUSE MEN

11:36.934 --> 11:38.400
DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE WITH A

11:38.467 --> 11:40.567
WOMAN, DON'T WANT TO BE IN THE

11:40.633 --> 11:42.133
SAME OFFICE AS A WOMAN.

11:42.200 --> 11:43.000
>> I'M SO SCARED TO LOOK AT A

11:43.066 --> 11:43.867
WOMAN.

11:43.934 --> 11:44.934
I'M SO SCARED TO COMPLIMENT A

11:45.000 --> 11:45.767
WOMAN.

11:45.834 --> 11:46.734
I'M SO SCARED TO EVEN HUG A

11:46.800 --> 11:47.800
WOMAN.

11:47.867 --> 11:48.800
'CAUSE I BETTER HAVE A BIG

11:48.867 --> 11:49.867
ENOUGH BANK ACCOUNT FOR HER TO

11:49.934 --> 11:51.367
TURN AROUND AND FILE A COMPLAINT

11:51.433 --> 11:52.200
OR FILE A LAWSUIT AGAINST ME.

11:52.266 --> 11:53.567
>> HUH?

11:53.633 --> 11:55.967
>> I'M STARTING TO BE CONCERNED

11:56.033 --> 11:57.467
THAT INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE AFRAID

11:57.533 --> 11:58.333
OF BEING HURT, AND THAT'S A BAD

11:58.400 --> 11:59.567
SIGN.

11:59.633 --> 12:00.734
AND SO THE QUESTION IS, WHAT ARE

12:00.800 --> 12:02.400
THE RULES?

12:02.467 --> 12:03.166
HOW DO WE FIND OUT WHAT THEY

12:03.233 --> 12:04.166
ARE?

12:04.233 --> 12:04.900
HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE

12:04.967 --> 12:05.934
GUILTY?

12:06.000 --> 12:07.633
WHAT IS GOING ON?

12:07.700 --> 12:09.066
>> John: YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW,

12:09.133 --> 12:11.834
YOU CAN TELL SO MUCH ABOUT A

12:11.900 --> 12:14.367
QUESTION FROM THE MERE TONE WITH

12:14.433 --> 12:15.333
WHICH IT IS ASKED.

12:15.400 --> 12:20.600
BECAUSE "WHAT ARE THE RULES?" IS

12:20.667 --> 12:22.700
NOT INHERENTLY A BAD THING TO

12:22.767 --> 12:23.300
ASK, IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE

12:23.367 --> 12:23.633
ANSWER.

12:23.700 --> 12:24.767
"WHAT 'ARE' THE RULES?" SOUNDS

12:24.834 --> 12:25.633
MORE LIKE AN ERECTION'S

12:25.700 --> 12:26.333
TEMPER TANTRUM.

12:26.400 --> 12:27.467
BUT THE POINT HERE IS, IT DOES

12:27.533 --> 12:28.367
SEEM LIKE WE'RE ON THE VERGE OF

12:28.433 --> 12:29.066
A NATIONAL RECKONING ABOUT

12:29.133 --> 12:30.000
SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

12:30.066 --> 12:31.233
MAJOR COMPANIES LIKE FORD HAVE

12:31.300 --> 12:32.033
HAD TO PAY MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR

12:32.100 --> 12:33.033
SETTLEMENTS AND PROMISE TO

12:33.100 --> 12:34.033
CHANGE THEIR CORPORATE CULTURE.

12:34.100 --> 12:35.266
A WAVE OF WOMEN ARE NOW RUNNING

12:35.333 --> 12:36.800
FOR OFFICE IN WHAT'S BEING

12:36.867 --> 12:38.033
CALLED "THE YEAR OF THE WOMAN."

12:38.100 --> 12:39.767
AND "TIME'S UP" WAS EVEN A THEME

12:39.834 --> 12:40.967
OF THIS YEAR'S OSCARS SHOW.

12:41.033 --> 12:42.500
NOW, UNFORTUNATELY, EVERYTHING I

12:42.567 --> 12:44.567
JUST SAID ALSO DESCRIBES THE

12:44.633 --> 12:46.233
1990s, WHEN POWERFUL COMPANIES

12:46.300 --> 12:47.834
LIKE FORD PAID OUT

12:47.900 --> 12:49.533
MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR SETTLEMENTS

12:49.600 --> 12:50.800
AND PROMISED TO CHANGE THEIR

12:50.867 --> 12:52.233
CULTURE, AND A WAVE OF WOMEN RAN

12:52.300 --> 12:54.500
FOR OFFICE IN 1992, PROMPTING IT

12:54.567 --> 12:56.200
TO BE CALLED "THE YEAR OF THE

12:56.266 --> 12:57.900
WOMAN," AND THAT THEME WAS THE

12:57.967 --> 12:59.767
BACKDROP OF THE NEXT YEAR'S

12:59.834 --> 13:01.667
OSCARS, FEATURING THIS MOMENT:

13:01.734 --> 13:02.934
>> ♪ LADIES! ♪

13:03.000 --> 13:04.867
♪ LADIES! ♪

13:04.934 --> 13:08.467
♪ EVERYWHERE! ♪

13:20.734 --> 13:25.734
♪ HILLARY WILL LEAD THE WAY ♪

13:25.800 --> 13:28.467
>> John: OUCH.

13:28.533 --> 13:31.633
THE ONLY WAY THAT COULD BE MORE

13:31.700 --> 13:34.967
ON-THE-NOSE IS IF, AFTER THEY

13:35.033 --> 13:36.367
SANG, "HILLARY WILL LEAD THE

13:36.433 --> 13:37.433
WAY," DONALD TRUMP CAME ONSTAGE,

13:37.500 --> 13:38.266
GROPED THE BACKUP DANCERS, AND

13:38.333 --> 13:38.967
SOMEHOW WON BEST PICTURE DESPITE

13:39.033 --> 13:41.233
LOSING THE POPULAR VOTE.

13:41.300 --> 13:42.900
NOW, THAT NATIONAL CONVERSATION

13:42.967 --> 13:43.934
IN THE '90s WAS LARGELY

13:44.000 --> 13:45.867
KICKSTARTED BY THE EXPERIENCE OF

13:45.934 --> 13:49.133
THIS WOMAN.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.000
AND IF YOU ARE TOO YOUNG TO

13:50.066 --> 13:51.033
REMEMBER WHO THAT IS, FIRST,

13:51.100 --> 13:52.166
ENJOY SNAPCHATTING YOUR

13:52.233 --> 13:52.867
STUDENT LOAN AVOCADO TOAST OR

13:52.934 --> 13:53.800
WHATEVER IT IS YOU PEOPLE DO.

13:53.867 --> 13:55.567
AND SECONDLY, THAT IS

13:55.633 --> 13:57.100
ANITA HILL.

13:57.166 --> 13:58.467
SHE WAS COMPELLED TO TESTIFY

13:58.533 --> 13:59.433
BEFORE THE SENATE JUDICIARY

13:59.500 --> 14:00.667
COMMITTEE IN THE

14:00.734 --> 14:02.033
CONFIRMATION HEARINGS OF

14:02.100 --> 14:03.400
JUDGE CLARENCE THOMAS AND SHE

14:03.467 --> 14:04.900
INFORMED THEM THAT, WHEN SHE'D

14:04.967 --> 14:06.333
WORKED FOR HIM YEARS BEFORE,

14:06.400 --> 14:07.967
SHE'D BEEN REPEATEDLY HARASSED.

14:08.033 --> 14:09.567
SHE GAVE A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF

14:09.633 --> 14:11.300
INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR, FROM

14:11.367 --> 14:12.433
UNWANTED ADVANCES TO THOMAS

14:12.500 --> 14:14.300
BRAGGING ABOUT THE SIZE OF HIS

14:14.367 --> 14:15.567
OWN PENIS TO AN INFAMOUS STORY

14:15.633 --> 14:17.166
ABOUT A PUBIC HAIR IN A

14:17.233 --> 14:18.934
COKE CAN, WHICH IS THE MOST

14:19.000 --> 14:20.767
DISGUSTING THING YOU COULD

14:20.834 --> 14:22.967
POSSIBLY DISCOVER IN A COKE CAN

14:23.033 --> 14:25.233
OTHER THAN PEPSI.

14:25.300 --> 14:26.266
AND WHILE ENOUGH SENATORS

14:26.333 --> 14:27.834
BELIEVED THOMAS' DENIALS TO

14:27.900 --> 14:29.233
CONFIRM HIM, THE TERRIBLE

14:29.300 --> 14:30.500
TREATMENT THAT ANITA HILL

14:30.567 --> 14:32.333
RECEIVED DURING THE HEARINGS

14:32.400 --> 14:33.066
INSPIRED A NATIONWIDE EFFORT TO

14:33.133 --> 14:34.233
STOP WORKPLACE HARASSMENT ONCE

14:34.300 --> 14:35.433
AND FOR ALL.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.934
NOW, CLEARLY, THAT DID NOT WORK.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.133
SO TONIGHT, SINCE WE SEEM TO BE

14:38.200 --> 14:39.600
GOING IN CIRCLES ON THIS ISSUE,

14:39.667 --> 14:41.667
LET'S TRY AND AT LEAST TALK

14:41.734 --> 14:42.967
ABOUT IT, IF ONLY BECAUSE NO ONE

14:43.033 --> 14:44.600
WANTS TO SEE "ENDING WORKPLACE

14:44.667 --> 14:46.166
HARASSMENT" AS THE UNOFFICIAL

14:46.233 --> 14:49.166
THEME OF THE 2048 OSCARS, HOSTED

14:49.233 --> 14:50.133
BY A SOMEHOW STILL AGELESS

14:50.200 --> 14:58.400
PAUL RUDD.

14:58.467 --> 14:59.433
AND LET'S JUST START WITH ONE OF

14:59.500 --> 15:00.300
THOSE BASIC QUESTIONS THAT

15:00.367 --> 15:01.066
TUCKER CARLSON WHINED INTO HIS

15:01.133 --> 15:02.066
CAMERA, "WHAT ARE THE RULES?"

15:02.133 --> 15:03.066
IT'S SOMETHING THAT CONTINUES TO

15:03.133 --> 15:03.900
CONFUSE PEOPLE, DESPITE ALL

15:03.967 --> 15:05.033
THOSE SHITTY TRAINING VIDEOS

15:05.100 --> 15:06.600
SHOWING EXAMPLES OF A DANGEROUS

15:06.667 --> 15:09.900
OFFICE CULTURE.

15:09.967 --> 15:11.133
>> HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN THE NEW

15:11.200 --> 15:12.667
BLONDE SECRETARY OVER AT

15:12.734 --> 15:14.333
SHIPPING?

15:14.400 --> 15:16.500
BOY, CAN SHE TYPE!

15:16.567 --> 15:17.500
>> OH, TYPE?

15:17.567 --> 15:18.667
HELL, YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING

15:18.734 --> 15:21.567
UNTIL YOU SEEN HER FILE, MAN.

15:21.633 --> 15:24.233
>> LISTEN, IF YOU BOYS ARE

15:24.300 --> 15:24.834
IMPRESSED WITH HER TYPING AND

15:24.900 --> 15:27.333
FILING, WAIT UNTIL SHE TAKES

15:27.400 --> 15:28.367
YOUR DICTATION.

15:30.700 --> 15:35.000
♪ ♪

15:35.066 --> 15:36.934
>> John: NOW, I REALIZE THIS

15:37.000 --> 15:38.800
ISN'T NECESSARILY THE MOST

15:38.867 --> 15:40.166
RELEVANT CRITICISM OF THAT MAN'S

15:40.233 --> 15:41.166
BEHAVIOR, BUT HE JUST LEFT

15:41.233 --> 15:43.533
WITHOUT WASHING HIS HANDS.

15:43.600 --> 15:45.133
THERE WAS -- THERE WAS JUST ZERO

15:45.200 --> 15:46.400
DAYLIGHT BETWEEN THE TIME HIS

15:46.467 --> 15:47.700
FINGERS ADJUSTED HIS COLLEAGUE'S

15:47.767 --> 15:48.767
NECKTIE AND THE TIME THEY

15:48.834 --> 15:52.166
ADJUSTED HIS OWN PENIS.

15:52.233 --> 15:53.800
BUT THE QUESTION "WHAT IS

15:53.867 --> 15:55.967
SEXUAL HARASSMENT?" ACTUALLY

15:56.033 --> 15:57.600
DOES HAVE AN ANSWER, BECAUSE

15:57.667 --> 15:58.800
WHILE COMPANIES MAY HAVE THEIR

15:58.867 --> 15:59.967
OWN POLICIES, FROM A LEGAL

16:00.033 --> 16:01.400
STANDPOINT, SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS

16:01.467 --> 16:02.900
CONSIDERED A FORM OF EMPLOYMENT

16:02.967 --> 16:04.200
DISCRIMINATION, JUST LIKE

16:04.266 --> 16:05.633
DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF

16:05.700 --> 16:06.800
RACE OR AGE.

16:06.867 --> 16:08.667
IT BECOMES UNLAWFUL WHEN IT IS

16:08.734 --> 16:10.333
SEVERE OR PERVASIVE ENOUGH THAT

16:10.400 --> 16:11.533
IT CREATES A HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT

16:11.600 --> 16:13.567
OR WHEN IT INCLUDES A

16:13.633 --> 16:15.100
QUID PRO QUO, MEANING EMPLOYEES

16:15.166 --> 16:16.200
HAVE TO ENDURE THE HARASSMENT OR

16:16.266 --> 16:18.066
RISK LOSING THEIR JOBS.

16:18.133 --> 16:19.033
SO THAT IS WHAT CONSTITUTES

16:19.100 --> 16:21.900
SEXUAL HARASSMENT UNDER THE LAW.

16:21.967 --> 16:22.967
IT'S NOT A SINGLE SHITTY JOKE OR

16:23.033 --> 16:24.367
A BOTCHED COMPLIMENT.

16:24.433 --> 16:25.600
IT'S GOING OUT OF YOUR WAY TO

16:25.667 --> 16:27.033
MAKE SOMEONE ELSE'S WORKDAY A

16:27.100 --> 16:28.400
PSYCHOSEXUAL NIGHTMARE.

16:28.467 --> 16:29.600
BUT, OF COURSE, BEHAVIOR DOESN'T

16:29.667 --> 16:30.900
HAVE TO BE ILLEGAL TO BE

16:30.967 --> 16:34.834
INAPPROPRIATE.

16:34.900 --> 16:35.900
ANY TIME THAT YOU'RE MAKING

16:35.967 --> 16:36.800
SOMEONE ELSE UNCOMFORTABLE,

16:36.867 --> 16:37.800
THAT'S A PROBLEM.

16:37.867 --> 16:39.033
AND SOME OF THIS INVOLVES

16:39.100 --> 16:40.767
JUDGMENT AND CONSIDERATION.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.300
SO IS A HUG OKAY?

16:42.367 --> 16:42.867
WELL, IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS,

16:42.934 --> 16:44.934
MAYBE.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.467
I WOULD ARGUE, IF IT'S FROM

16:46.533 --> 16:49.900
BEHIND, NEVER.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.133
INCIDENTALLY, "IS A HUG OKAY?"

16:51.200 --> 16:52.867
IS BRITAIN'S TOP-SELLING SEX-ED

16:52.934 --> 16:53.533
BOOK, AND THE ANSWER IS SIMPLY

16:53.600 --> 16:57.834
"NO."

16:57.900 --> 16:58.934
THE PROBLEM IS, SOME PEOPLE HAVE

16:59.000 --> 16:59.967
DECIDED TO HANDLE THE COMPLEXITY

17:00.033 --> 17:00.967
OF THIS ISSUE NOT BY MODIFYING

17:01.033 --> 17:01.700
THEIR BEHAVIOR BUT BY MODIFYING

17:01.767 --> 17:02.967
THEIR STAFF.

17:03.033 --> 17:04.400
AND I WILL LET INSTANTLY

17:04.467 --> 17:05.300
EXHAUSTING EASTER ISLAND HEAD

17:05.367 --> 17:06.700
TONY ROBBINS, THE AUTHOR OF THE

17:06.767 --> 17:07.834
BOOK "THE WORST PERSON YOU KNOW

17:07.900 --> 17:12.400
IS CURRENTLY READING THIS,"

17:12.467 --> 17:13.633
I'LL LET HIM EXPLAIN.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.100
>> TONIGHT, TONY ROBBINS TAKING

17:15.166 --> 17:16.266
HEAT AFTER THESE COMMENTS.

17:16.333 --> 17:17.166
>> I'M NOT KNOCKING THE #MeToo

17:17.233 --> 17:18.300
MOVEMENT, I'M KNOCKING

17:18.367 --> 17:19.367
VICTIMHOOD.

17:19.433 --> 17:20.400
>> ROBBINS SAYING SOME MEN IN

17:20.467 --> 17:21.467
HOLLYWOOD NOW AFRAID TO HIRE

17:21.533 --> 17:22.767
WOMEN.

17:22.834 --> 17:23.800
>> I WAS JUST WITH SOMEBODY THE

17:23.867 --> 17:24.934
OTHER DAY.

17:25.000 --> 17:25.834
VERY FAMOUS MAN, VERY POWERFUL

17:25.900 --> 17:26.967
MAN WAS SAYING HOW STRESSED HE

17:27.033 --> 17:28.333
IS BECAUSE HE INTERVIEWED THREE

17:28.400 --> 17:29.266
PEOPLE THAT DAY.

17:29.333 --> 17:30.433
ONE WAS A WOMAN.

17:30.500 --> 17:31.333
TWO WERE MEN.

17:31.400 --> 17:32.767
THE WOMAN WAS BETTER QUALIFIED,

17:32.834 --> 17:34.300
BUT SHE WAS VERY ATTRACTIVE AND

17:34.367 --> 17:36.033
HE KNEW, "I CAN'T HAVE HER

17:36.100 --> 17:37.200
AROUND BECAUSE IT'S TOO BIG A

17:37.266 --> 17:38.166
RISK," AND HE HIRED SOMEBODY

17:38.233 --> 17:40.333
ELSE.

17:40.400 --> 17:41.834
>> John: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING

17:41.900 --> 17:45.967
ABOUT, TONY?

17:46.033 --> 17:47.734
YOU DO GET THAT THAT'S NOT A

17:47.800 --> 17:48.967
STORY ABOUT A PROBLEM WITH THE

17:49.033 --> 17:50.166
#MeToo MOVEMENT, RIGHT?

17:50.233 --> 17:50.767
THAT'S A STORY ABOUT A MAN WHO

17:50.834 --> 17:51.567
SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO HAVE

17:51.633 --> 17:52.633
EMPLOYEES AT ALL.

17:52.700 --> 17:53.033
YOU PROBABLY THINK

17:53.100 --> 17:53.767
JEFFREY DAHMER WAS JUST THE

17:53.834 --> 17:54.433
VICTIM OF DANGEROUS MEN AND BOYS

17:54.500 --> 17:55.433
WHO WALKED AROUND ALL DAY BEING

17:55.500 --> 17:57.734
TOO EDIBLE.

17:57.800 --> 18:02.867
NOW, THE THING IS -- THE THING

18:02.934 --> 18:03.500
IS, UNFORTUNATELY, ARGUMENTS

18:03.567 --> 18:04.600
LIKE THAT CAN SLOW

18:04.667 --> 18:05.600
DOWN ANY MOVEMENT TOWARDS

18:05.667 --> 18:06.500
FINDING REAL SOLUTIONS.

18:06.567 --> 18:08.100
AND TOO OFTEN, ASPERSIONS ARE

18:08.166 --> 18:09.233
CAST ON ANYONE COMING FORWARD,

18:09.300 --> 18:11.000
FROM "THEY'RE JUST DOING IT TO

18:11.066 --> 18:12.233
GET RICH" TO "THEY'RE JUST DOING

18:12.300 --> 18:13.800
IT FOR REVENGE" TO "WHY ARE THEY

18:13.867 --> 18:15.333
COMING FORWARD NOW?"

18:15.400 --> 18:16.800
AND IT IS STRANGE THAT WE GO

18:16.867 --> 18:19.300
THERE SO QUICKLY, BECAUSE THAT

18:19.367 --> 18:20.867
JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN WITH OTHER

18:20.934 --> 18:21.834
TRAUMATIC EVENTS.

18:21.900 --> 18:23.800
IF YOUR HOUSE BURNT DOWN, YOU

18:23.867 --> 18:25.400
WOULDN'T EXPECT A NEWSCASTER TO

18:25.467 --> 18:26.800
IMMEDIATELY START ASKING,

18:26.867 --> 18:27.934
"WHY ARE YOU COMING FORWARD NOW?

18:28.000 --> 18:32.934
WAS THIS INSURANCE FRAUD?

18:33.000 --> 18:33.633
WAS YOUR HOUSE WEARING

18:33.700 --> 18:35.934
SOMETHING FLAMMABLE?

18:36.000 --> 18:37.133
AND IS IT ACTUALLY ON

18:37.200 --> 18:42.300
FIRE AT ALL, BECAUSE WHERE'S THE

18:42.367 --> 18:43.000
LINE BETWEEN FIRE AND NOT FIRE

18:43.066 --> 18:43.734
ANYMORE?

18:43.800 --> 18:44.600
IT'S SO HARD TO TELL.

18:44.667 --> 18:46.834
I'M TERRIFIED TO BE AROUND

18:46.900 --> 18:47.800
HOUSES ANYMORE."

18:47.867 --> 18:48.567
BUT WITH SEXUAL HARASSMENT,

18:48.633 --> 18:49.333
THAT'S SO OFTEN WHERE THE

18:49.400 --> 18:50.100
CONVERSATION GOES, WITH

18:50.166 --> 18:51.734
IMMEDIATE CONCERN LESS FOR THE

18:51.800 --> 18:52.400
VICTIM AND MORE FOR THE

18:52.467 --> 18:53.200
ACCUSED.

18:53.266 --> 18:54.300
>> THERE IS NO DUE PROCESS RIGHT

18:54.367 --> 18:55.533
NOW.

18:55.600 --> 18:56.533
>> RIGHT NOW, ACCUSATION,

18:56.600 --> 18:57.433
ALLEGATION, GOODBYE.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.000
EVERYBODY GETS FIRED.

18:59.066 --> 18:59.900
>> I WONDER IF YOU DESTROY MEN

18:59.967 --> 19:00.834
OR COMPLETE THE DESTRUCTION OF

19:00.900 --> 19:01.934
MEN -- THEY'RE PRETTY CLOSE TO

19:02.000 --> 19:03.133
BEING DESTROYED, I WOULD SAY --

19:03.200 --> 19:06.600
HOW DOES IT HELP WOMEN EXACTLY?

19:06.667 --> 19:13.734
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

19:13.800 --> 19:15.000
IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE.

19:15.066 --> 19:15.567
MEN ARE DESTROYED!

19:15.633 --> 19:20.800
IT'S THE END OF MEN!

19:20.867 --> 19:22.767
IT'S WORSE, YOU MONSTERS!

19:22.834 --> 19:23.900
WOMEN ARE TAKING US DOWN.

19:23.967 --> 19:24.734
AND EVEN WORSE, NOW ALL THE

19:24.800 --> 19:25.900
GHOSTBUSTERS ARE WOMEN, WHICH

19:25.967 --> 19:26.967
MEANS THAT WHEN WE DIE, WE'LL

19:27.033 --> 19:27.533
SPEND ALL OF ETERNITY BEING

19:27.600 --> 19:28.967
DESTROYED BY MORE WOMEN.

19:29.033 --> 19:30.400
IT'S NOT FAIR!

19:30.467 --> 19:31.300
AND LOOK, THE COURT OF PUBLIC

19:31.367 --> 19:32.700
OPINION IS FAR FROM AN IDEAL

19:32.767 --> 19:37.166
PLACE TO DEAL WITH INDIVIDUAL

19:37.233 --> 19:40.033
CLAIMS, BUT IT'S WORTH

19:40.100 --> 19:41.533
CONSIDERING WHY SOME FEEL THE

19:41.600 --> 19:42.800
NEED TO SPEAK PUBLICLY, BECAUSE

19:42.867 --> 19:44.400
IT OFTEN HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT

19:44.467 --> 19:45.800
THAT WE HAVE A PIECEMEAL,

19:45.867 --> 19:46.934
INADEQUATE PROCESS FOR

19:47.000 --> 19:47.567
ADDRESSING THE ISSUE PRIVATELY.

19:47.633 --> 19:48.767
THE LAW REQUIRES YOU TO FIRST GO

19:48.834 --> 19:49.400
THROUGH THE EEOC BEFORE YOU CAN

19:49.467 --> 19:50.867
FILE AN EMPLOYMENT

19:50.934 --> 19:54.433
DISCRIMINATION LAWSUIT, AND

19:54.500 --> 19:55.834
THEY ARE NOTORIOUSLY DIFFICULT

19:55.900 --> 19:56.433
TO WIN.

19:56.500 --> 19:57.600
AND WHILE STATE LAWS VARY, IF

19:57.667 --> 19:58.166
YOU WORK FOR A BUSINESS WITH

19:58.233 --> 19:58.934
LESS THAN 15 EMPLOYEES, THERE IS

19:59.000 --> 19:59.767
NO FEDERAL REMEDY FOR WORKPLACE

19:59.834 --> 20:01.033
SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.934
NONE.

20:03.000 --> 20:03.800
AND LET'S SAY YOU DON'T WANT TO

20:03.867 --> 20:04.667
FILE A LAWSUIT.

20:04.734 --> 20:06.066
MAYBE YOU, LIKE MANY PEOPLE,

20:06.133 --> 20:07.133
DON'T EVEN WANT YOUR HARASSER TO

20:07.200 --> 20:08.367
BE FIRED.

20:08.433 --> 20:09.633
YOU JUST WANT THE BAD BEHAVIOR

20:09.700 --> 20:12.800
TO STOP.

20:12.867 --> 20:13.867
THAT IS WHERE A COMPANY'S HR

20:13.934 --> 20:14.700
DEPARTMENT MIGHT COME IN.

20:14.767 --> 20:15.467
BUT PEOPLE CAN BE RELUCTANT TO

20:15.533 --> 20:16.300
GO TO HR FOR UNDERSTANDABLE

20:16.367 --> 20:17.200
REASONS.

20:17.266 --> 20:18.967
HR EXISTS TO PROTECT THE COMPANY

20:19.033 --> 20:20.066
FROM LIABILITY, NOT NECESSARILY

20:20.133 --> 20:21.433
TO SEEK JUSTICE ON AN EMPLOYEE'S

20:21.500 --> 20:24.667
BEHALF.

20:24.734 --> 20:25.767
AND ALL THOSE GUYS THAT YOU JUST

20:25.834 --> 20:29.233
SAW COMPLAINING ABOUT

20:29.300 --> 20:33.300
DUE PROCESS SHOULD REALLY KNOW

20:33.367 --> 20:35.700
THIS, BECAUSE THEY WORK AT

20:35.767 --> 20:37.200
FOX NEWS, WHERE HARASSMENT

20:37.266 --> 20:38.600
ALLEGATIONS ARE SO RAMPANT THAT

20:38.667 --> 20:40.100
THEIR BIGGEST STARS HAVE BEEN

20:40.166 --> 20:41.333
DROPPING LIKE SUSPECTS IN AN

20:41.400 --> 20:41.967
AGATHA CHRISTIE NOVEL.

20:42.033 --> 20:42.767
THERE WERE MULTIPLE ALLEGATIONS

20:42.834 --> 20:43.467
AGAINST BILL O'REILLY, AFTER

20:43.533 --> 20:44.166
WHICH THEIR PARENT COMPANY

20:44.233 --> 20:45.066
RESPONDED, "NO CURRENT OR FORMER

20:45.133 --> 20:46.266
FOX NEWS EMPLOYEE EVER TOOK

20:46.333 --> 20:47.166
ADVANTAGE OF THE 21ST CENTURY

20:47.233 --> 20:48.934
FOX HOTLINE TO RAISE A CONCERN

20:49.000 --> 20:52.033
ABOUT" HIM.

20:52.100 --> 20:53.900
AND MAYBE THAT IS BECAUSE THOSE

20:53.967 --> 20:54.500
WOMEN KNEW THAT THE HUGE POWER

20:54.567 --> 20:55.100
DISPARITY BETWEEN THEM AND

20:55.166 --> 20:56.133
O'REILLY WAS UNLIKELY TO WORK IN

20:56.200 --> 20:58.467
THEIR FAVOR.

20:58.533 --> 20:59.333
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS

20:59.400 --> 21:00.667
ACTUALLY POINTED OUT TO O'REILLY

21:00.734 --> 21:02.133
BY PERHAPS THE SINGLE WORST

21:02.200 --> 21:04.266
PERSON POSSIBLE.

21:04.333 --> 21:05.967
>> EVERY ALLEGATION IN THIS AREA

21:06.033 --> 21:07.233
IS A CONVICTION.

21:07.300 --> 21:08.400
THEY DON'T LOOK FOR THE TRUTH.

21:08.467 --> 21:09.633
>> BUT -- BUT THINK ABOUT THOSE

21:09.700 --> 21:12.133
FIVE WOMEN AND WHAT THEY DID.

21:12.200 --> 21:13.333
THEY CAME FORWARD AND FILED

21:13.400 --> 21:14.734
COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE BIGGEST

21:14.800 --> 21:16.166
STAR AT THE NETWORK THEY WORKED

21:16.233 --> 21:18.834
AT.

21:18.900 --> 21:19.967
THINK OF HOW INTIMIDATING THAT

21:20.033 --> 21:20.767
MUST HAVE BEEN, HOW

21:20.834 --> 21:21.633
NERVE-RACKING THAT MUST HAVE

21:21.700 --> 21:22.400
BEEN.

21:22.467 --> 21:23.333
DOESN'T THAT TELL YOU HOW

21:23.400 --> 21:23.967
STRONGLY THEY FELT ABOUT THE WAY

21:24.033 --> 21:27.467
THEY WERE TREATED BY YOU?

21:27.533 --> 21:34.066
>> John: WOW.

21:34.133 --> 21:36.300
THAT IS A ADMIRABLY

21:36.367 --> 21:36.867
CONFRONTATIONAL QUESTION,

21:36.934 --> 21:37.533
MATT LAUER.

21:37.600 --> 21:38.767
YOU'VE REALLY BACKED HIM INTO A

21:38.834 --> 21:39.300
CORNER, PRESSURED HIM INTO

21:39.367 --> 21:39.900
GIVING YOU WHAT YOU WANT, AND

21:39.967 --> 21:40.467
LOCKED THE DOOR BEHIND YOU.

21:40.533 --> 21:41.000
METAPHORICALLY, OF COURSE.

21:41.066 --> 21:41.734
METAPHORICALLY, OF COURSE.

21:41.800 --> 21:42.567
BUT, BUT AS WE NOW KNOW, THE

21:42.633 --> 21:43.500
ABSENCE OF CALLS TO A HOTLINE

21:43.567 --> 21:44.967
DOES NOT MEAN AN ABSENCE OF

21:45.033 --> 21:47.000
SYSTEMIC SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

21:47.066 --> 21:48.033
AND WHILE BILL O'REILLY DENIED

21:48.100 --> 21:49.300
THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HIM, HE

21:49.367 --> 21:50.700
REPORTEDLY SETTLED ONE OF THEM

21:50.767 --> 21:54.900
FOR $32 MILLION.

21:54.967 --> 21:57.600
$32 MILLION TO ONE PERSON.

21:57.667 --> 21:58.800
AND THAT'S WHERE THE

21:58.867 --> 22:00.300
NEGOTIATIONS ENDED UP, AT A

22:00.367 --> 22:01.400
FIGURE SLIGHTLY MORE THAN THE

22:01.467 --> 22:03.066
PRODUCTION BUDGET OF

22:03.133 --> 22:06.500
"LA LA LAND."

22:06.567 --> 22:07.633
O'REILLY ALLEGEDLY ENGAGED IN A

22:07.700 --> 22:08.867
"LA LA LAND'S" WORTH OF

22:08.934 --> 22:10.333
HARASSMENT.

22:10.400 --> 22:11.367
SO IF NOBODY CALLED FOX'S HR

22:11.433 --> 22:14.867
HOTLINE, THAT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM

22:14.934 --> 22:15.834
WITH THEIR FUCKING HR HOTLINE.

22:15.900 --> 22:16.900
AND WHEN YOU COMBINE A TOXIC

22:16.967 --> 22:18.700
WORKPLACE WITH A LACK OF

22:18.767 --> 22:19.533
CONFIDENCE IN SYSTEMS OF

22:19.600 --> 22:24.066
ACCOUNTABILITY, BAD THINGS

22:24.133 --> 22:24.834
CAN HAPPEN.

22:24.900 --> 22:25.567
JUST LOOK AT THE U.S. FOREST

22:25.633 --> 22:26.600
SERVICE, WHERE WOMEN HAVE BEEN

22:26.667 --> 22:29.200
COMING FORWARD DESCRIBING A

22:29.266 --> 22:29.934
BOYS-CLUB ATMOSPHERE RIFE WITH

22:30.000 --> 22:30.667
HARASSMENT AND RETALIATION.

22:30.734 --> 22:31.400
JUST LISTEN TO ONE EMPLOYEE

22:31.467 --> 22:32.233
EXPLAIN WHAT SHE WENT THROUGH IN

22:32.300 --> 22:34.400
FILING A COMPLAINT.

22:34.467 --> 22:37.266
>> I WANTED JUSTICE, BUT I

22:37.333 --> 22:38.667
WASN'T, LIKE, IN IT FOR SOME

22:38.734 --> 22:39.433
PERSONAL VENDETTA.

22:39.500 --> 22:40.767
I DON'T WANT THIS TO HAPPEN TO

22:40.834 --> 22:43.200
OTHER WOMEN.

22:43.266 --> 22:45.000
AND I DON'T WANT HIM TO DO IT,

22:45.066 --> 22:46.433
LIKE, IN THE FUTURE.

22:46.500 --> 22:49.700
>> HER COMPLAINT DETAILED

22:49.767 --> 22:50.600
SEVERAL INSTANCES OF

22:50.667 --> 22:52.633
INAPPROPRIATE PHYSICAL CONTACT.

22:52.700 --> 22:53.900
ONCE HE RUBBED HER BUTT, ANOTHER

22:53.967 --> 22:55.533
TIME IT WAS HER INNER THIGH.

22:55.600 --> 22:57.000
ANOTHER TIME HE GRABBED HER

22:57.066 --> 22:59.433
BREASTS, PUT HIS HAND BETWEEN

22:59.500 --> 23:00.100
HER LEGS AND GROPED HER.

23:00.166 --> 23:01.567
TWO MONTHS LATER, THE FOREST

23:01.633 --> 23:05.934
SERVICE SENT HER A LETTER.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.066
>> IT SAID AN INVESTIGATION

23:07.133 --> 23:11.133
AGAINST ALLEGATIONS OF

23:11.200 --> 23:12.500
MISCONDUCT WAS CONDUCTED, AND WE

23:12.567 --> 23:15.667
FOUND THAT THERE WAS NO

23:15.734 --> 23:18.200
MISCONDUCT.

23:18.266 --> 23:19.433
AND SO THEN IT JUST FEELS LIKE

23:19.500 --> 23:20.467
YOU'RE, LIKE, SCREAMING INTO A

23:20.533 --> 23:21.467
VOID.

23:21.533 --> 23:22.934
LIKE, "THIS HAPPENED," AND

23:23.000 --> 23:25.233
NOBODY HEARS THAT.

23:25.300 --> 23:26.600
OR BELIEVES IT.

23:26.667 --> 23:27.800
OR THEY HEAR IT AND DON'T

23:27.867 --> 23:34.233
BELIEVE IT AT ALL.

23:34.300 --> 23:34.734
>> John: THAT IS VERY

23:34.800 --> 23:35.433
DEPRESSING.

23:35.500 --> 23:36.200
AND HONESTLY, I CAN'T SAY I'M

23:36.266 --> 23:36.967
SURPRISED THE FOREST SERVICE IS

23:37.033 --> 23:37.834
A HOTBED OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT.

23:37.900 --> 23:38.834
WHAT SORT OF GOVERNMENT AGENCY

23:38.900 --> 23:39.633
ROUTINELY ALLOWS AN EMPLOYEE TO

23:39.700 --> 23:40.467
SHOW UP TO WORK WITHOUT WEARING

23:40.533 --> 23:41.433
A SHIRT?

23:41.500 --> 23:42.700
AND I DO NOT WANT TO HEAR THE

23:42.767 --> 23:43.834
EXCUSE, "OH, SMOKEY'S A BEAR, OF

23:43.900 --> 23:45.200
COURSE HE DOESN'T HAVE A SHIRT."

23:45.266 --> 23:47.400
HE HAS A PERSONALIZED HAT AND

23:47.467 --> 23:49.700
BELT.

23:49.767 --> 23:51.266
THAT ASSHOLE IS WISE TO SHIRTS.

23:51.333 --> 24:05.900
PUT ONE ON!

24:05.967 --> 24:06.934
AND LOOK, THE POINT IS -- IT'S

24:07.000 --> 24:07.900
NOT ABOUT HIM -- SHE'S NOT

24:07.967 --> 24:10.734
ALONE.

24:10.800 --> 24:11.367
ABBY BOLT, A BATTALION CHIEF

24:11.433 --> 24:12.333
WITH THE FOREST SERVICE, WAS

24:12.400 --> 24:12.900
ASSAULTED ON ASSIGNMENT, AND

24:12.967 --> 24:13.667
WHILE SHE DID TELL THE POLICE,

24:13.734 --> 24:14.266
SHE DIDN'T PRESS CHARGES, AND

24:14.333 --> 24:14.900
HER DESCRIPTION OF WHY SHE FELT

24:14.967 --> 24:15.467
SHE COULDN'T TELL HER BOSSES

24:15.533 --> 24:16.567
ABOUT THE INCIDENT IS

24:16.633 --> 24:16.934
HEARTBREAKING.

24:17.000 --> 24:17.800
>> WATCHING SOMEBODY THAT WOULD

24:17.867 --> 24:18.567
FILE A COMPLAINT OR MAKE A

24:18.633 --> 24:20.300
COMPLAINT IMMEDIATELY BECAME THE

24:20.367 --> 24:21.066
PROBLEM.

24:21.133 --> 24:22.200
AND, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE

24:22.266 --> 24:23.400
THE TERM "THAT GIRL," OR

24:23.467 --> 24:25.033
"THOSE GIRLS."

24:25.100 --> 24:26.233
I DON'T WANT TO BE

24:26.300 --> 24:26.900
ONE OF "THOSE GIRLS."

24:26.967 --> 24:27.767
YOU KNOW?

24:27.834 --> 24:28.533
I'VE INTRODUCED MYSELF THAT WAY

24:28.600 --> 24:29.233
TO PEOPLE, I THINK, BEFORE,

24:29.300 --> 24:30.033
LIKE, "HEY, I'M ABBY.

24:30.100 --> 24:31.033
DON'T WORRY, I'M

24:31.100 --> 24:31.867
NOT ONE OF THOSE GIRLS" OR --

24:31.934 --> 24:32.967
>> ONE OF THOSE GIRLS BEING

24:33.033 --> 24:35.333
SOMEONE WHO SIMPLY SAYS, "THAT

24:35.400 --> 24:36.300
BEHAVIOR IS WRONG.

24:36.367 --> 24:37.000
LET'S DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT."

24:37.066 --> 24:38.100
>> EXACTLY.

24:38.166 --> 24:38.934
I WAS -- I WAS TRAINED THAT WAY

24:39.000 --> 24:39.834
MY WHOLE -- DON'T BE ONE OF

24:39.900 --> 24:41.800
"THOSE GIRLS."

24:41.867 --> 24:42.533
>> John: THAT IS JUST TERRIBLE.

24:42.600 --> 24:43.467
AND THE CULTURE SHE'S DESCRIBING

24:43.533 --> 24:45.633
IS WAY TOO SIMILAR TO THE

24:45.700 --> 24:46.467
CULTURE THAT WE THOUGHT WE COULD

24:46.533 --> 24:48.000
WORK TO ELIMINATE THE LAST TIME

24:48.066 --> 24:51.233
WE HAD A BIG CONVERSATION ABOUT

24:51.300 --> 24:52.300
THIS, BACK IN 1991 WITH

24:52.367 --> 24:53.233
ANITA HILL.

24:53.300 --> 24:55.900
AND RE-WATCHING HER TESTIMONY

24:55.967 --> 24:56.667
NOW, IT'S DEPRESSING HOW MANY OF

24:56.734 --> 24:57.800
THE TECHNIQUES USED TO UNDERMINE

24:57.867 --> 24:58.767
HER ARE STILL AROUND TODAY, FROM

24:58.834 --> 24:59.400
CONCERN OVER FALSE ALLEGATIONS

24:59.467 --> 25:00.266
TO BLAMING THE VICTIM TO

25:00.333 --> 25:01.333
OUTRIGHT CHARACTER

25:01.400 --> 25:04.333
ASSASSINATION.

25:04.400 --> 25:09.300
>> LET ME TELL YOU, THE LAW OF

25:09.367 --> 25:11.066
SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS SO BROAD

25:11.133 --> 25:12.834
THAT A PERSON CAN ACCUSE ANOTHER

25:12.900 --> 25:14.033
AT ANY TIME AND RUIN THEIR

25:14.100 --> 25:15.367
REPUTATION JUST BY AN UNFOUNDED

25:15.433 --> 25:16.867
ALLEGATION.

25:16.934 --> 25:18.600
>> HOW COULD YOU ALLOW THIS KIND

25:18.667 --> 25:20.000
OF REPREHENSIBLE CONDUCT TO GO

25:20.066 --> 25:21.934
ON RIGHT IN THE HEADQUARTERS

25:22.000 --> 25:22.934
WITHOUT DOING SOMETHING ABOUT

25:23.000 --> 25:25.800
IT?

25:25.867 --> 25:29.867
>> I REALLY AM GETTING STUFF

25:29.934 --> 25:30.667
OVER THE TRANSOM ABOUT

25:30.734 --> 25:31.934
PROFESSOR HILL.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.934
I HAVE GOT LETTERS HANGING OUT

25:35.033 --> 25:35.700
OF MY POCKET.

25:35.767 --> 25:36.700
I HAVE GOT FAXES.

25:36.767 --> 25:37.667
STATEMENTS FROM TULSA, OKLAHOMA,

25:37.734 --> 25:38.533
SAYING, "WATCH OUT FOR THIS

25:38.600 --> 25:40.000
WOMAN."

25:40.066 --> 25:41.200
BUT NOBODY'S GOT THE GUTS TO SAY

25:41.266 --> 25:42.233
THAT BECAUSE IT GETS ALL TANGLED

25:42.300 --> 25:44.400
UP IN THIS SEXUAL HARASSMENT

25:44.467 --> 25:46.200
CRAP.

25:46.266 --> 25:47.433
>> John: LITERALLY THE ONLY

25:47.500 --> 25:49.500
PARTS OF THAT MONTAGE THAT WOULD

25:49.567 --> 25:50.600
SOUND AT ALL OUT OF PLACE TODAY

25:50.667 --> 25:51.867
ARE THE WORD "TRANSOM" AND THE

25:51.934 --> 25:59.100
CONCEPT OF "FAXES."

25:59.166 --> 25:59.867
AGAIN, FOR YOUNG PEOPLE:

25:59.934 --> 26:01.233
A FAX IS LIKE IF A TEXT MESSAGE

26:01.300 --> 26:02.467
FUCKED A TELEGRAM.

26:02.533 --> 26:03.166
OH, A TELEGRAM IS LIKE --

26:03.233 --> 26:04.033
YOU KNOW WHAT, YOUNG PEOPLE?

26:04.100 --> 26:05.467
NEVER MIND.

26:05.533 --> 26:11.500
GO BACK TO YOUR AVOCADO TOAST.

26:11.567 --> 26:14.000
THE TRAGIC FACT HERE IS, WHILE

26:14.066 --> 26:15.333
WE'VE MADE SOME PROGRESS

26:15.400 --> 26:16.767
REGARDING WORKPLACE HARASSMENT

26:16.834 --> 26:18.033
SINCE THEN, WE CLEARLY HAVEN'T

26:18.100 --> 26:18.600
COME FAR ENOUGH.

26:18.667 --> 26:20.700
SO WHAT CAN WE DO?

26:20.767 --> 26:21.266
WELL, I'D SAY THE FIRST STEP

26:21.333 --> 26:21.867
FOR BOTH MANAGEMENT AND

26:21.934 --> 26:22.567
EMPLOYEES IS AWARENESS OF THE

26:22.633 --> 26:23.433
PROBLEM.

26:23.500 --> 26:24.100
THE NEXT IS FOR COMPANIES TO

26:24.166 --> 26:24.800
DEVELOP WORKABLE, INTERNAL

26:24.867 --> 26:25.900
MECHANISMS TO DEAL WITH

26:25.967 --> 26:26.433
SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND FOR

26:26.500 --> 26:27.033
EMPLOYEES TO CHANGE THOSE

26:27.100 --> 26:27.967
BEHAVIOR PATTERNS WHICH MIGHT

26:28.033 --> 26:28.934
CONTRIBUTE TO IT.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.800
CHANGE IS IN THE AIR.

26:30.867 --> 26:32.100
NOW THAT WE KNOW THIS FORM OF

26:32.166 --> 26:33.500
DISCRIMINATION EXISTS, WE MUST

26:33.567 --> 26:34.433
PUT AN END TO IT.

26:34.500 --> 26:35.300
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

26:35.367 --> 26:36.967
I THINK WE WILL.

26:37.033 --> 26:38.433
AND I'D LOVE TO SAY I BELIEVE

26:38.500 --> 26:39.867
THAT, BUT REMEMBER THAT

26:39.934 --> 26:41.633
"GOOD OLD SEX" VIDEO THAT I

26:41.700 --> 26:42.266
SHOWED YOU EARLIER?

26:42.333 --> 26:43.266
THE ONE FROM 1981?

26:43.333 --> 26:44.967
THIS IS HOW IT ENDED.

26:45.033 --> 26:46.400
>> THE FIRST STEP FOR BOTH

26:46.467 --> 26:48.033
MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES IS

26:48.100 --> 26:50.700
AWARENESS OF THE PROBLEM.

26:50.767 --> 26:51.500
THE NEXT IS FOR COMPANIES TO

26:51.567 --> 26:52.767
DEVELOP WORKABLE, INTERNAL

26:52.834 --> 26:54.734
MECHANISMS TO DEAL WITH

26:54.800 --> 26:55.533
SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND FOR

26:55.600 --> 26:56.867
EMPLOYEES TO CHANGE THOSE

26:56.934 --> 26:57.633
BEHAVIOR PATTERNS WHICH MIGHT

26:57.700 --> 26:59.000
CONTRIBUTE TO IT.

26:59.066 --> 27:00.133
CHANGE IS IN THE AIR.

27:00.200 --> 27:01.700
NOW THAT WE KNOW THIS FORM OF

27:01.767 --> 27:02.800
DISCRIMINATION EXISTS, WE MUST

27:02.867 --> 27:04.367
PUT AN END TO IT.

27:04.433 --> 27:06.266
AND WE WILL.

27:06.333 --> 27:07.066
>> John: YEAH, SPOILER ALERT:

27:07.133 --> 27:08.767
WE DIDN'T.

27:08.834 --> 27:09.400
AND NOW I'M SAYING THE SAME

27:09.467 --> 27:10.467
THING.

27:10.533 --> 27:11.500
IT'S LIKE THE MOVIE

27:11.567 --> 27:13.066
"GROUNDHOG DAY", AND JUST LIKE

27:13.133 --> 27:14.633
THAT MOVIE, THERE'S ENTIRELY TOO

27:14.700 --> 27:15.266
MUCH UNACKNOWLEDGED WORKPLACE

27:15.333 --> 27:16.934
HARASSMENT HAPPENING IN PLAIN

27:17.000 --> 27:18.300
VIEW.

27:18.367 --> 27:19.734
SHE'S YOUR PRODUCER, BILL,

27:19.800 --> 27:26.166
AND IT'S ALWAYS HER FIRST DAY.

27:26.233 --> 27:28.200
LOOK, THE LARGE POINT HERE IS,

27:28.266 --> 27:29.834
TIME WAS SUPPOSED TO BE UP IN

27:29.900 --> 27:31.266
1981 AND 1991 AND NOW TIME IS

27:31.333 --> 27:32.000
SUPPOSED TO BE UP AGAIN.

27:32.066 --> 27:32.533
WILL THIS GO-AROUND BE

27:32.600 --> 27:34.333
DIFFERENT?

27:34.400 --> 27:35.133
I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW.

27:35.200 --> 27:36.033
BUT I DO KNOW AN EXPERT IN THIS

27:36.100 --> 27:36.633
FIELD THAT MAY HAVE SOME

27:36.700 --> 27:37.667
SUGGESTIONS.

27:37.734 --> 27:39.900
TAKE A LOOK.

27:39.967 --> 27:41.467
>> IN 1991, ANITA HILL TESTIFIED

27:41.533 --> 27:55.233
FOR EIGHT HOURS IN FRONT OF THE

27:55.300 --> 27:56.100
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE,

27:56.166 --> 27:57.700
ENDURING HUMILIATING QUESTIONS

27:57.767 --> 27:58.533
FROM A PANEL OF WORLD-CLASS

27:58.600 --> 27:59.066
ASSHOLES.

27:59.133 --> 27:59.767
SHE IS NOW A PROFESSOR AT

27:59.834 --> 28:00.500
BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY AND WAS KIND

28:00.567 --> 28:01.467
ENOUGH TO MEET WITH ME.

28:01.533 --> 28:01.967
>> John: PROFESSOR HILL,

28:02.033 --> 28:02.567
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SITTING

28:02.633 --> 28:03.033
DOWN WITH ME.

28:03.100 --> 28:03.633
>> THANK YOU, IT'S GOOD TO BE

28:03.700 --> 28:04.233
HERE.

28:04.300 --> 28:09.667
>> John: SO IT HAS BEEN 27 YEARS

28:09.734 --> 28:10.300
SINCE YOU TESTIFIED IN FRONT OF

28:10.367 --> 28:10.800
THE SENATE.

28:10.867 --> 28:11.467
WHAT HAS CHANGED IN THAT TIME?

28:11.533 --> 28:12.266
>> OH, THERE HAS BEEN A

28:12.333 --> 28:12.967
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CHANGE.

28:13.033 --> 28:13.767
THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE IN PUBLIC

28:13.834 --> 28:14.400
ATTITUDE, AND THERE HAS BEEN A

28:14.467 --> 28:15.100
CHANGE IN THE AMOUNT OF

28:15.166 --> 28:15.767
INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE ABOUT

28:15.834 --> 28:16.433
SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

28:16.500 --> 28:17.000
THERE IS CERTAINLY MORE

28:17.066 --> 28:18.000
AWARENESS AFTER THE #MeToo

28:18.066 --> 28:22.500
MOVEMENT.

28:22.567 --> 28:25.834
EVEN A FEW YEARS AGO, PEOPLE

28:25.900 --> 28:26.433
WERE AMBIVALENT ABOUT WHAT THE

28:26.500 --> 28:28.533
CONSEQUENCES SHOULD BE

28:28.600 --> 28:30.367
IF SOMEONE IS BEHAVING

28:30.433 --> 28:33.867
INCREDIBLY BADLY AND ABUSING

28:33.934 --> 28:34.667
PEOPLE THEY WORK WITH.

28:34.734 --> 28:36.433
>> John: I GUESS THE PROBLEM IS

28:36.500 --> 28:37.033
THERE IS THAT AWARENESS OF THE

28:37.100 --> 28:37.967
PROBLEM DOESN'T NECESSARILY MAKE

28:38.033 --> 28:38.800
SOMETHING BETTER.

28:38.867 --> 28:41.400
I'VE BEEN AWARE OF COLDPLAY FOR

28:41.467 --> 28:42.166
YEARS BUT THAT DOESN'T SEEMED TO

28:42.233 --> 28:43.033
HELP THE ISSUE GO AWAY.

28:43.100 --> 28:45.300
>> YOU -- YOU'RE RIGHT.

28:45.367 --> 28:46.900
PEOPLE WERE AWARE OF IT, BUT

28:46.967 --> 28:48.433
THERE WAS NO CONSENSUS ON, WHAT

28:48.500 --> 28:53.867
SHOULD WE DO ABOUT IT?

28:53.934 --> 28:55.700
>> John: YOU'VE SUGGESTED YOU

28:55.767 --> 28:57.000
CAN FIX THE WOMEN, YOU CAN FIX

28:57.066 --> 28:58.066
THE GUYS, OR YOU CAN CHANGE THE

28:58.133 --> 28:58.967
CULTURE, AND IF WE FIX THE GUYS

28:59.033 --> 28:59.567
AND FIX THE CULTURE, WE WON'T

28:59.633 --> 29:04.867
NEED TO CHANGE THE WOMEN.

29:04.934 --> 29:05.633
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

29:05.700 --> 29:06.667
AND SO FAR, MUCH OF THE APPROACH

29:06.734 --> 29:09.667
THAT WE HAVE HAD IS TO PUT ALL

29:09.734 --> 29:13.934
OF THE BURDEN ON WOMEN.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.200
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I GOT THAT

29:15.266 --> 29:16.066
JUST STICKS OUT TO ME.

29:16.133 --> 29:17.100
"HOW DO WE RAISE OUR DAUGHTER TO

29:17.166 --> 29:17.700
MAKE SURE THAT SHE DOESN'T SET

29:17.767 --> 29:18.500
HERSELF UP TO BE A VICTIM OF

29:18.567 --> 29:19.500
SEXUAL HARASSMENT?"

29:19.567 --> 29:23.000
>> John: OOF.

29:23.066 --> 29:24.367
>> THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS

29:24.433 --> 29:27.000
WE ARE THINKING.

29:27.066 --> 29:27.734
"IF WE FIX HER, THEN SHE WON'T

29:27.800 --> 29:33.533
ENCOUNTER THIS PROBLEM."

29:33.600 --> 29:34.767
AND IN REALITY, THAT'S --

29:34.834 --> 29:35.400
SHE IS NOT THE PROBLEM.

29:35.467 --> 29:36.166
>> John: SO LET'S TALK ABOUT

29:36.233 --> 29:37.166
MEN.

29:37.233 --> 29:37.934
I'M A MAN IN THE BROADEST SENSE

29:38.000 --> 29:38.800
OF THE WORD.

29:38.867 --> 29:39.533
LET'S TALK ABOUT MEN'S ROLE

29:39.600 --> 29:40.667
REGARDING TRYING TO FIX

29:40.734 --> 29:41.433
SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

29:41.500 --> 29:42.467
DO MEN HAVE A ROLE IN THAT

29:42.533 --> 29:43.467
DISCUSSION?

29:43.533 --> 29:44.200
>> YES.

29:44.266 --> 29:45.033
>> John: WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

29:45.100 --> 29:46.266
>> YES.

29:46.333 --> 29:47.367
>> John: IT'S NICE TO BE NEEDED.

29:47.433 --> 29:48.834
>> YOU ARE NEEDED.

29:48.900 --> 29:50.066
WE NEED YOU TO STEP UP...

29:50.133 --> 29:51.567
>> John: OH.

29:51.633 --> 29:53.300
>> AND TO REALIZE AT THIS POINT

29:53.367 --> 29:55.200
IN TIME, THERE ARE NO INNOCENT

29:55.266 --> 29:57.734
BYSTANDERS.

29:57.800 --> 29:59.200
IF YOU ARE AWARE OF SOMETHING,

29:59.266 --> 30:00.567
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE IT, YOU KNOW

30:00.633 --> 30:02.533
IT'S WRONG, BUT YOU DON'T DO

30:02.600 --> 30:04.633
ANYTHING ABOUT IT, THEN IT IS

30:04.700 --> 30:07.900
THE SAME AS PARTICIPATING IN IT.

30:07.967 --> 30:08.934
>> IS IT WORTH TRYING TO SPOT

30:09.000 --> 30:09.867
SOME OF THE MORE DISINGENUOUS

30:09.934 --> 30:14.133
QUESTIONS OUT THERE?

30:14.200 --> 30:15.200
ONE OF THE REFRAINS YOU

30:15.266 --> 30:15.767
HEAR A LOT IS, "WHERE IS THE

30:15.834 --> 30:16.633
LINE?"

30:16.700 --> 30:18.767
BUT IT SEEMS THAT IS OFTEN IN

30:18.834 --> 30:19.567
SEARCH OF A ANSWER THAT WILL

30:19.633 --> 30:21.100
IDENTIFY EXACTLY HOW CLOSE TO

30:21.166 --> 30:21.967
THE LINE THEY CAN POSSIBLY GET.

30:22.033 --> 30:23.734
SO IF AN 8-SECOND HUG IS

30:23.800 --> 30:29.633
UNACCEPTABLE, GREAT, I'M DOING A

30:29.700 --> 30:30.633
7 1/2-SECOND HUG AND I'M

30:30.700 --> 30:32.066
FILLING IT WITH AS MUCH

30:32.133 --> 30:33.834
CREEPINESS AS I CAN.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.500
>> AND UNFORTUNATELY, THE LAW

30:35.567 --> 30:37.433
HAS ALLOWED THAT TO HAPPEN.

30:37.500 --> 30:38.734
TO THAT, YOU KNOW, IT WAS BAD,

30:38.800 --> 30:40.266
BUT IT WASN'T QUITE BAD ENOUGH.

30:40.333 --> 30:43.734
IT WAS A 7 1/2-SECOND HUG.

30:43.800 --> 30:44.567
>> John: IT WAS A SEVEN

30:44.633 --> 30:45.700
MISSISSIPP.

30:45.767 --> 30:46.900
>> AND MAYBE THEY DIDN'T EVEN

30:46.967 --> 30:50.266
REALIZE THEY WERE GETTING CLOSE

30:50.333 --> 30:52.633
TO THE 8 SECONDS BECAUSE THEY'RE

30:52.700 --> 30:59.567
NOT GOOD WITH NUMBERS.

30:59.633 --> 31:06.033
SO IT HAS TO BE WITH THE LAW.

31:06.100 --> 31:06.800
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SO OFTEN

31:06.867 --> 31:07.667
HAPPENS IS THAT THE LAW AROUND

31:07.734 --> 31:08.667
DISCRIMINATION RELIES ON INTENT.

31:08.734 --> 31:09.800
DID THEY INTEND TO HARM YOU?

31:09.867 --> 31:11.266
WELL, IF YOU'RE A VICTIM, IT

31:11.333 --> 31:12.433
DOESN'T MATTER SO MUCH WHETHER

31:12.500 --> 31:13.600
THEY INTENDED.

31:13.667 --> 31:14.967
>> John: YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE

31:15.033 --> 31:16.667
INTENDED TO HIT ME WITH YOUR

31:16.734 --> 31:18.333
CAR, BUT YOU HIT ME.

31:18.400 --> 31:19.367
>> YEAH, YOU HIT ME.

31:19.433 --> 31:21.033
AND THAT MEANS THAT THERE ARE

31:21.100 --> 31:22.500
REPERCUSSIONS AND CONSEQUENCES

31:22.567 --> 31:23.967
REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOUR INTENT

31:24.033 --> 31:25.367
WAS.

31:25.433 --> 31:27.166
>> WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF MEN

31:27.233 --> 31:28.567
SAYING THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY

31:28.633 --> 31:30.834
TERRIFIED TO BE ALONE WITH A

31:30.900 --> 31:31.633
WOMAN NOW.

31:31.700 --> 31:32.633
SHOULD THEY BE SCARED?

31:32.700 --> 31:33.467
>> NOT IF THEY ARE NOT

31:33.533 --> 31:34.367
HARASSERS.

31:34.433 --> 31:38.967
>> John: RIGHT.

31:39.033 --> 31:39.600
IT'S LITERALLY THAT SIMPLE?

31:39.667 --> 31:40.633
>> YEAH.

31:40.700 --> 31:41.567
IF YOU ARE A HARASSER, YOU

31:41.633 --> 31:42.834
SHOULD BE TERRIFIED, AND YOU

31:42.900 --> 31:43.900
SHOULD NOT DO THAT.

31:43.967 --> 31:46.367
THE WHOLE IDEA OF FALSE CLAIMS

31:46.433 --> 31:47.934
IS SOMETHING THAT IS ANOTHER ONE

31:48.000 --> 31:49.467
OF THOSE ROADBLOCKS THAT PEOPLE

31:49.533 --> 31:51.233
THROW UP.

31:51.300 --> 31:53.467
WELL, THAT REALLY HASN'T

31:53.533 --> 31:55.467
MANIFESTED ITSELF.

31:55.533 --> 31:56.800
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT NEVER

31:56.867 --> 31:58.800
HAPPENS, BUT THEY ARE SO RARE

31:58.867 --> 32:00.400
THAT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE

32:00.467 --> 32:02.000
DON'T NEED TO MAKE RULES AROUND

32:02.066 --> 32:05.900
THE THINGS THAT RARELY HAPPEN

32:05.967 --> 32:06.867
UNTIL WE FINISH UP MAKING THE

32:06.934 --> 32:08.333
RULES AROUND THE THINGS THAT ARE

32:08.400 --> 32:11.066
HAPPENING REGULARLY.

32:11.133 --> 32:12.900
>> John: THERE ARE MEN AFRAID

32:12.967 --> 32:14.166
THAT IF THEY ARE ACCUSED, THEY

32:14.233 --> 32:15.333
ARE JUST GOING TO WIND UP BEING

32:15.400 --> 32:16.734
DRAGGED IN FRONT OF SOME KIND OF

32:16.800 --> 32:17.266
TRIBUNAL WITH THEIR WHOLE

32:17.333 --> 32:20.233
PRIVATE LIFE UP FOR REVIEW

32:20.300 --> 32:21.767
AGAINST PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY

32:21.834 --> 32:25.567
ARE LYING NO MATTER WHAT THEY'RE

32:25.633 --> 32:27.800
SAYING, AND IN THE PROCESS OF

32:27.867 --> 32:29.333
DOING THAT, THEIR LIFE COULD BE

32:29.400 --> 32:30.100
TURNED COMPLETELY UPSIDE DOWN.

32:30.166 --> 32:30.834
COULD YOU, ANITA HILL, EVEN

32:30.900 --> 32:31.567
IMAGINE WHAT THAT MIGHT FEEL

32:31.633 --> 32:33.300
LIKE?

32:33.367 --> 32:42.266
>> OH, YEAH, I CAN.

32:42.333 --> 32:43.567
>> John: YOU COULD IMAGINE THAT?

32:43.633 --> 32:44.233
>> IT'S ACTUALLY NOT

32:44.300 --> 32:44.834
IMAGINATIVE.

32:44.900 --> 32:46.033
I ACTUALLY HAVE HAD MY LIFE

32:46.100 --> 32:46.467
TURNED UPSIDE DOWN.

32:46.533 --> 32:47.100
>> John: OH, YEAH, THAT THING.

32:47.166 --> 32:48.233
SO LET'S GO BACK TO 1991.

32:48.300 --> 32:48.867
YOU WERE CALLED TO APPEAR BEFORE

32:48.934 --> 32:49.533
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE,

32:49.600 --> 32:50.166
AND IT SEEMS LIKE YOU HAD A SET

32:50.233 --> 32:50.734
OF EXPECTATIONS OF HOW THAT

32:50.800 --> 32:51.700
WOULD GO, AND THOSE EXPECTATIONS

32:51.767 --> 32:53.734
WERE, IN A VERY REAL SENSE, NOT

32:53.800 --> 32:55.467
MET.

32:55.533 --> 32:56.800
WAS THERE A POINT DURING THOSE

32:56.867 --> 32:57.633
EIGHT HOURS THAT YOU WERE KIND

32:57.700 --> 32:58.300
OF THINKING TO YOURSELF,

32:58.367 --> 32:59.166
"REALLY?

32:59.233 --> 33:00.066
THIS IS WHAT TODAY IS GOING TO

33:00.133 --> 33:03.467
BE?"

33:03.533 --> 33:04.967
>> THERE WAS A POINT WHERE THEY

33:05.033 --> 33:05.934
SAID SOMETHING ABOUT, "WELL,

33:06.000 --> 33:07.133
WHAT PROCEDURE WOULD YOU LIKE TO

33:07.200 --> 33:08.367
BE PUT IN PLACE?"

33:08.433 --> 33:09.834
I'M A WITNESS.

33:09.900 --> 33:10.667
I'M ON THE WITNESS STAND.

33:10.734 --> 33:12.200
I'M TRYING TO TESTIFY.

33:12.266 --> 33:14.467
AND I THOUGHT, "THEY REALLY

33:14.533 --> 33:19.066
DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING."

33:19.133 --> 33:20.700
>> John: IT'S AMAZING.

33:20.767 --> 33:21.433
YOU SHOWED SUPERHUMAN LEVELS OF

33:21.500 --> 33:22.300
RESTRAINT DURING THAT

33:22.367 --> 33:23.266
DAY, BUT THERE ARE STILL MOMENTS

33:23.333 --> 33:25.333
WHERE IT FEELS LIKE YOU CAN

33:25.400 --> 33:26.633
READ, NOT JUST FRUSTRATION BUT,

33:26.700 --> 33:27.900
LIKE, SEETHING CONTEMPT ON YOUR

33:27.967 --> 33:31.433
FACE.

33:31.500 --> 33:33.834
>> OH, WELL, I TRIED TO BE NOT

33:33.900 --> 33:37.433
SEETHING --

33:37.500 --> 33:38.433
>> John: YOU DID AN AMAZING JOB,

33:38.500 --> 33:40.100
THERE WERE JUST -- AND I COULD

33:40.166 --> 33:41.233
BE PROJECTING THIS -- MOMENTS

33:41.300 --> 33:42.433
WHERE YOU WERE GOING TO TELL

33:42.500 --> 33:45.667
ORRIN HATCH TO GO FUCK HIMSELF.

33:45.734 --> 33:51.533
>> MAYBE NOT IN THOSE EXACT

33:51.600 --> 33:52.533
>> MAYBE NOT IN THOSE EXACT

33:52.600 --> 33:53.266
WORDS, BUT --

33:53.333 --> 33:54.767
>> John: WHAT I'M SAYING, IF YOU

33:54.834 --> 33:55.400
HAD, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY

33:55.467 --> 33:55.767
JUSTIFIED.

33:55.834 --> 33:58.967
>> ANY OF THE REACTIONS THAT I

33:59.033 --> 33:59.567
HAVE NOW IS SORT OF HINDSIGHT.

33:59.633 --> 34:00.166
I FELT LIKE I WAS ENTITLED TO.

34:00.233 --> 34:00.767
I WILL ADD THAT IN TERMS OF MY

34:00.834 --> 34:03.433
DISPLAY OF CONTEMPT, YOU KNOW, I

34:03.500 --> 34:04.667
HAVE LIVED THROUGH A LOT OF

34:04.734 --> 34:10.300
CHALLENGES, AND HAVING QUESTIONS

34:10.367 --> 34:23.233
THROWN AT ME TO CHALLENGE MY

34:23.300 --> 34:24.700
COMPETENCY AS A WOMAN, AS A

34:24.767 --> 34:27.767
WOMAN OF COLOR.

34:27.834 --> 34:29.967
AND SO MUCH OF WHAT I HEARD THAT

34:30.033 --> 34:30.500
DAY WAS FAMILIAR IN TONE.

34:30.567 --> 34:31.100
THE QUESTIONS WERE DIFFERENT,

34:31.166 --> 34:32.100
BUT THE TONE WAS REALLY

34:32.166 --> 34:32.767
SOMETHING THAT WAS ALL TOO

34:32.834 --> 34:33.233
FAMILIAR.

34:33.300 --> 34:34.767
>> John: YOU WERE ACCUSED AT THE

34:34.834 --> 34:35.367
TIME, LIKE WOMEN ARE ACCUSED

34:35.433 --> 34:36.066
NOW, OF COMING FORWARD TO GET

34:36.133 --> 34:36.734
RICH AND FAMOUS.

34:36.800 --> 34:37.433
HOW DID THAT WORK OUT FOR YOU?

34:37.500 --> 34:38.300
>> WELL, SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY

34:38.367 --> 34:39.967
THAT I AM INFAMOUS, SO IT

34:40.033 --> 34:42.433
CERTAINLY WORKED IN THAT WAY,

34:42.500 --> 34:43.367
BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT I EVER

34:43.433 --> 34:44.700
WANTED TO BE FAMOUS OR RICH, I

34:44.767 --> 34:47.100
HAD A PLAN FOR DOING THAT THAT

34:47.166 --> 34:50.200
WOULD NOT HAVE INVOLVED THE HURT

34:50.266 --> 34:52.800
AND HARM THAT WAS DONE, NOT ONLY

34:52.867 --> 34:56.433
TO MYSELF, BUT CERTAINLY TO MY

34:56.500 --> 34:57.266
FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND THE

34:57.333 --> 35:02.633
PEOPLE WHO WERE BEHIND ME.

35:02.700 --> 35:03.233
>> John: SO LET'S TALK ABOUT

35:03.300 --> 35:04.367
FIXES.

35:04.433 --> 35:05.333
HISTORICALLY, WHENEVER

35:05.400 --> 35:06.166
SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMES TO THE

35:06.233 --> 35:07.200
FORE IN THE CULTURE, IT SEEMS

35:07.266 --> 35:08.900
LIKE WE THINK ABOUT IT JUST LONG

35:08.967 --> 35:10.433
ENOUGH TO FEEL LIKE WE'VE

35:10.500 --> 35:11.700
ADDRESSED IT BUT NOT QUITE LONG

35:11.767 --> 35:14.066
ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY ADDRESS IT.

35:14.133 --> 35:15.433
WHAT ARE THE WAYS THAT WE CAN

35:15.500 --> 35:17.367
TACKLE THE PROBLEM OF WORKPLACE

35:17.433 --> 35:19.567
HARASSMENT?

35:19.633 --> 35:21.433
>> WELL, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

35:21.500 --> 35:22.500
WE NEED TO DO TO CHANGE THE

35:22.567 --> 35:24.467
CULTURE AND ACTUALLY CONVINCE

35:24.533 --> 35:26.834
PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, WE ARE SERIOUS

35:26.900 --> 35:27.533
ABOUT IT, IS TO PUBLICIZE THE

35:27.600 --> 35:31.066
POLICIES AND TO INFORM PEOPLE,

35:31.133 --> 35:33.433
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU FILE

35:33.500 --> 35:36.000
A COMPLAINT.

35:36.066 --> 35:36.867
HERE ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU

35:36.934 --> 35:39.066
WILL DO.

35:39.133 --> 35:40.200
HERE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU

35:40.266 --> 35:41.233
WILL FACE.

35:41.300 --> 35:42.533
HERE IS THE PROCESS.

35:42.600 --> 35:43.467
I ALSO THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME

35:43.533 --> 35:45.000
MANAGEMENT THINGS THAT WE CAN

35:45.066 --> 35:47.066
DO.

35:47.133 --> 35:51.867
WE, FOR EXAMPLE, CAN DO BY

35:51.934 --> 35:56.867
BYSTANDER TRAINING, BECAUSE I

35:56.934 --> 35:57.800
THINK THERE'S PEOPLE THAT

35:57.867 --> 35:58.533
ARE SAYING, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO

35:58.600 --> 35:59.100
DO.

35:59.166 --> 35:59.900
>> John: I THINK OF MYSELF IN

35:59.967 --> 36:00.567
THE WORKPLACE OVER THE YEARS,

36:00.633 --> 36:01.333
AND I CAN'T HONESTLY SAY THAT I

36:01.400 --> 36:02.367
CONSISTENTLY SPOKE UP IF I SAW

36:02.433 --> 36:07.500
CREEPY BEHAVIOR, ESPECIALLY WHEN

36:07.567 --> 36:08.200
I WAS MUCH YOUNGER AND I FELT

36:08.266 --> 36:08.934
THAT I WAS ON THE LOWER END OF A

36:09.033 --> 36:12.867
POWER DYNAMIC AND DIDN'T

36:12.934 --> 36:16.200
NECESSARILY FEEL EMPOWERED TO

36:16.266 --> 36:18.900
SPEAK OUT AND SAY, "THAT'S

36:18.967 --> 36:20.300
WRONG."

36:20.367 --> 36:21.033
THAT'S A PRETTY POOR EXCUSE, BUT

36:21.100 --> 36:21.700
IT'S PROBABLY HOW I FELT AT THE

36:21.767 --> 36:22.567
TIME.

36:22.633 --> 36:23.200
HOW SHOULD I FEEL ABOUT MYSELF

36:23.266 --> 36:23.967
LOOKING BACK OTHER THAN SLIGHTLY

36:24.033 --> 36:24.767
ASHAMED?

36:24.834 --> 36:26.467
>> SLIGHTLY ASHAMED IS A GOOD

36:26.533 --> 36:28.500
START.

36:28.567 --> 36:29.367
>> John: THAT'S A VERY FINE WAY

36:29.433 --> 36:30.233
TO PUT IT.

36:30.300 --> 36:32.100
ACTUAL SHAME WOULD BE, AT THE

36:32.166 --> 36:36.400
VERY LEAST, THE DESTINATION

36:36.467 --> 36:37.567
YOU WOULD AIM FOR.

36:37.633 --> 36:38.767
>> SOMETIMES SHAME IS HELPFUL.

36:38.834 --> 36:40.033
SOMETIMES SHAME IS NOT HELPFUL.

36:40.100 --> 36:41.166
IT JUST MAKES PEOPLE FEEL GUILTY

36:41.233 --> 36:44.000
AND MAYBE EVEN RESENTFUL.

36:44.066 --> 36:46.400
SO WE -- YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO

36:46.467 --> 36:47.667
HIT THIS AT A MOMENT WHERE

36:47.734 --> 36:48.700
PEOPLE FEEL EMPATHETIC AND NOT

36:48.767 --> 36:51.133
JUST EMBARRASSED AND ASHAMED OF

36:51.200 --> 36:52.500
THEMSELVES.

36:52.567 --> 36:55.200
IF YOU WERE TO GO BACK TO SOME

36:55.266 --> 36:56.033
OF THESE SITUATIONS, JUST PICK

36:56.100 --> 36:59.066
ONE, WHAT WOULD YOU DO NOW?

36:59.133 --> 37:00.333
>> John: I THINK PROBABLY JUST

37:00.400 --> 37:01.800
SAY, "THAT WAS A PRETTY CREEPY

37:01.867 --> 37:03.100
THING TO DO."

37:03.166 --> 37:10.200
RIGHT?

37:10.266 --> 37:10.867
>> THAT'S A REALLY SORT OF MANLY

37:10.934 --> 37:12.000
THING TO DO.

37:12.066 --> 37:14.734
BUT MIGHT YOU ALSO SAY TO THE

37:14.800 --> 37:16.467
PERSON WHO IS GETTING THE BRUNT

37:16.533 --> 37:18.100
OF THIS AND SAY, YOU KNOW, "HOW

37:18.166 --> 37:19.400
ARE YOU?

37:19.467 --> 37:20.867
HOW DOES THIS FEEL TO YOU?

37:20.934 --> 37:21.867
WOULD YOU LIKE FOR ME TO SAY

37:21.934 --> 37:22.734
SOMETHING?"

37:22.800 --> 37:25.600
>> John: YEAH.

37:25.667 --> 37:32.600
IT'S KIND OF SAD THAT THAT'S NOT

37:32.667 --> 37:33.600
INSTINCTIVE REACTION, ISN'T IT?

37:33.667 --> 37:34.400
>> WELL, THERE ARE SADDER

37:34.467 --> 37:35.066
REACTIONS.

37:35.133 --> 37:35.867
>> John: HOW OPTIMISTIC CAN YOU

37:35.934 --> 37:36.667
ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE RIGHT NOW

37:36.734 --> 37:37.400
IN TERMS OF HOW THINGS ARE GOING

37:37.467 --> 37:38.333
TO CHANGE?

37:38.400 --> 37:39.166
>> I AM CERTAINLY MORE

37:39.233 --> 37:40.066
OPTIMISTIC THAN I WAS 27 YEARS

37:40.133 --> 37:41.266
AGO.

37:41.333 --> 37:42.600
>> John: THAT'S A LOW BAR.

37:42.667 --> 37:48.500
>> THAT'S A VERY LOW BAR.

37:48.567 --> 37:49.400
BUT EVEN THEN, I WAS SOMEWHAT

37:49.467 --> 37:50.266
OPTIMISTIC, BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN

37:50.333 --> 37:51.367
PEOPLE STEP UP.

37:51.433 --> 37:52.300
I HAVE HEARD FROM WOMEN WHOSE

37:52.367 --> 37:53.834
LIVES HAVE BEEN CHANGED BECAUSE

37:53.900 --> 37:55.600
THINGS HAPPENED DIFFERENTLY WHEN

37:55.667 --> 37:56.934
THEY WENT FORWARD WITH THEIR

37:57.000 --> 37:58.066
COMPLAINT THAN THEY WOULD HAVE

37:58.133 --> 37:59.367
EXPECTED IT TO HAPPEN YEARS

37:59.433 --> 38:02.667
BEFORE.

38:02.734 --> 38:04.433
SO I AM -- I'M HOPEFUL.

38:04.500 --> 38:06.166
>> John: WHEN DO YOU THINK THIS

38:06.233 --> 38:07.800
PROBLEM WILL FINALLY BE FIXED?

38:07.867 --> 38:08.867
DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE WRAPPED

38:08.934 --> 38:09.667
UP BEFORE OR AFTER THE ICE CAPS

38:09.734 --> 38:11.266
HAVE GONE?

38:11.333 --> 38:14.900
I'M JUST TRYING TO WORK OUT

38:14.967 --> 38:15.767
WHETHER A SAFE WORKPLACE AND

38:15.834 --> 38:16.533
POLAR BEARS ARE MUTUALLY

38:16.600 --> 38:17.266
EXCLUSIVE.

38:17.333 --> 38:18.567
>> WELL, THE ICE CAPS ARE

38:18.633 --> 38:19.367
MELTING PRETTY FAST, AND THE

38:19.433 --> 38:21.400
CHANGE HERE SEEMS TO BE

38:21.467 --> 38:22.734
GLACIALLY SLOW.

38:22.800 --> 38:24.700
>> John: RIGHT.

38:24.767 --> 38:27.467
>> BUT I WILL SAY THAT IF WE DO

38:27.533 --> 38:29.734
NOTHING, THE CHANGE IS NOT GOING

38:29.800 --> 38:31.500
TO COME.

38:31.567 --> 38:32.667
>> John: ANITA HILL, THANK YOU

38:32.734 --> 38:33.800
SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO US.

38:33.867 --> 38:35.834
>> THANK YOU.

38:35.900 --> 38:37.333
>> John: THAT'S OUR SHOW,

38:37.400 --> 38:38.867
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

38:38.934 --> 38:40.133
SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

38:40.200 --> 38:42.033
GOOD NIGHT!
