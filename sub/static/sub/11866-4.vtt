11:36.529 --> 11:38.770
everything we do here
at Global Dynamics

11:38.865 --> 11:40.025

the boundaries...

11:43.036 --> 11:44.526
Yes, | read the brief,

11:48.541 --> 11:49.701

11:49.751 --> 11:50.786

11:50.877 --> 11:55.837

will revolutionize the way
we engage enemies in battle.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.213

a little later.

13:30.226 --> 13:31.557
Yeah, he's just
pulling in now.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.633
Good.

13:32.895 --> 13:35.978
Beverly, I am not asking you
to do anything inappropriate.

13:36.024 --> 13:39.141
Of course not. I'll just keep
my eyes and ears open,
like you said.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.567
He has a tremendous amount
of say over our funding.

13:41.654 --> 13:42.939
It’s all in
the town ’5 best interests.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.695
I completely understand.

14:00.798 --> 14:02.049
What do you think
you're doing?

14:03.343 --> 14:05.004
Nothing, Congressman.

14:05.636 --> 14:07.342
Then what's in your hand?

14:07.388 --> 14:08.628
Nothing.

14:09.724 --> 14:10.930
Really?

14:12.602 --> 14:13.933
Don't lie.

14:15.229 --> 14:18.062
l was just looking for...
You're hurting me.

14:18.149 --> 14:19.355
Then scream.

14:22.570 --> 14:23.935
You scream.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.403
You remembered.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.617
You're hard to forget.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.534
Spencer!

14:41.172 --> 14:42.378
Spencer!

14:42.673 --> 14:44.538
Taggart, for God's sakes,
pick up.

14:45.176 --> 14:46.916
Tag, where are you?

15:03.736 --> 15:05.067
We're too late.

15:07.156 --> 15:08.407
Spencer!

15:09.617 --> 15:12.154
Spencer!
Spencer!

15:12.286 --> 15:13.901
It's too narrow
for a tractor path.

15:13.996 --> 15:17.079
Yeah, these crops
have been flattened, not cut.

15:17.125 --> 15:18.160
SPENCER: Help...

15:18.251 --> 15:19.286
Do you hear that?

15:19.377 --> 15:20.787
What?
What?

15:23.214 --> 15:24.545
Spencer!

15:27.218 --> 15:28.503
(SPENCER COUGHING)

15:32.473 --> 15:33.462
Spencer!

15:34.725 --> 15:35.760
Spencer, are you all right?

15:35.852 --> 15:37.012
What happened?

15:37.770 --> 15:40.147
I can't...
I can't talk about it.

15:40.231 --> 15:41.311
Why not?

15:44.902 --> 15:46.312
They're watching.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.126
Spencer, what happened
to your hands?

16:08.217 --> 16:09.593
They left me here.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.796
Who?
I can't...

16:13.181 --> 16:14.296
I can't...

16:14.348 --> 16:15.383
Spencer.

16:19.061 --> 16:20.221
You're not alone.

16:21.105 --> 16:22.220
He's clearly
traumatized.

16:22.315 --> 16:23.851
Well, maybe Beverly
can reach him.

16:24.233 --> 16:25.939
Yeah, all right,
I'll take him there.

16:26.235 --> 16:27.315
Henry, you okay?

16:27.403 --> 16:29.143
No, but I will be
once he is.

16:29.405 --> 16:30.645
Keep me posted.

16:38.331 --> 16:39.320
What do you think?

16:39.415 --> 16:40.780
Well, he probably
passed out.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.494
Friends played
a prank on him.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.166
Really?

16:44.253 --> 16:45.538
Come on.

16:45.630 --> 16:48.747
There's always
a logical explanation
for these things.

16:49.091 --> 16:51.468
Yeah, that sounded
very logical.

16:52.053 --> 16:54.465
Okay, Jo,
what's your theory?

16:54.514 --> 16:56.004
Well, it's a crop.

16:56.057 --> 16:57.137
Yeah.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.428
And there's a circle in it.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.723
No. No, no, no.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.267
I don't care
how weird this town gets.
There's one thing that I know,

17:05.358 --> 17:06.689
and that's that
there are no aliens.

17:06.776 --> 17:07.936
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

17:10.196 --> 17:11.561
Yeah? Jack Carter.

Oh, hey, Allison.

17:15.326 --> 17:16.862
That makes two today.

I know. I know. I know.
You don't want to hear
about it.

Okay, I'm on my way.

Someone else disappeared.

17:23.543 --> 17:24.703
Fargo.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.809
That's one thing
I can scratch off
my to-do list.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.562
Or keep it
on there for later.

17:53.030 --> 17:54.110
We're clean?

17:54.198 --> 17:56.905
Nothing about what
we just did was clean.

17:59.203 --> 18:00.739
You know
what I'm talking about.

18:01.080 --> 18:04.072

every hour.

18:04.125 --> 18:05.456
No one can hear us.

18:06.419 --> 18:10.037
The Consortium believes
the artifact was excavated
and moved.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.080
To Eureka?
To Section Five.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.415
Well, even you can't get
access to that.

18:14.594 --> 18:17.836
No, but Nathan Stark can.

18:18.055 --> 18:20.171
You think he'll just
take you on a tour?

18:20.266 --> 18:22.552
If there's something
worthwhile in it for him.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.177
You'll need leverage.

18:26.272 --> 18:27.933
That's why I'm here,
Dr. Barlowe.

18:29.025 --> 18:30.640
You know him
better than anyone.

18:32.778 --> 18:36.566
You'll need to barter
with the one thing
he loves more than anything.

18:36.616 --> 18:37.651
Allison Blake?

18:37.742 --> 18:38.948
Science.

18:39.285 --> 18:42.493
Stark lives
to push boundaries
to leave his mark.

18:42.580 --> 18:44.821
He can't do that
without funding, so...

18:44.915 --> 18:48.043
So his sin is pride.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.247
I heard somewhere
it comes before a fall.

(DOORBELL RINGING)

19:03.684 --> 19:05.185

19:05.394 --> 19:07.225
You're safe here.
You can talk to me.

No, let the bill die.

with my name on it.

our mutual friends happy.

Okay.

19:26.957 --> 19:28.367
Spencer, what is it?

19:30.336 --> 19:34.249
Nothing.
I didn't see anything.

19:37.259 --> 19:39.215
Okay, Dr. Stark.
I'm ready to be impressed.

19:39.303 --> 19:41.419
You will not be
disappointed, Congressman.

Allison, could you...

19:45.768 --> 19:47.178
Oh. Okay, I'll catch up.

19:47.228 --> 19:48.308
Sweetheart.

19:48.354 --> 19:50.640
Hey. So how's Spencer?

19:50.690 --> 19:53.272
He's been better.
How's Fargo?

19:53.359 --> 19:55.725
The last person to see
Fargo was Dr. Sharat,

19:55.820 --> 19:58.436
and he missed
a critical meeting with Stark.
It's not like him.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.863
Spencer was acting odd, too.
I need to talk to Dr. Sharat.

20:00.908 --> 20:02.569
No, that's gonna have to wait.

20:02.660 --> 20:04.742
She's kind of in the middle
of something important.

20:04.829 --> 20:07.036
Well, so am |,
and you called me, so...

20:12.795 --> 20:14.626
By decade's end,
wars will be fought

20:14.714 --> 20:16.830
from command screens
such as this one.

20:17.717 --> 20:21.209
There will no longer be
a need for massive troops
on the ground.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.219
Dr. Sharat?

20:24.306 --> 20:26.922
The PX-319 transmits
a low frequency signal

20:27.017 --> 20:30.680
that delivers
a subconscious message of fear
and paranoia to the amygdala,

20:30.730 --> 20:33.563
deep in the brain,
causing the enemy to turn
against one another

20:33.649 --> 20:36.686
in a violent rage,
as this demonstration
will show.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.366
Just... Just one moment.

20:50.166 --> 20:54.580
A violent rage.
This is worth 80 million.

20:58.632 --> 20:59.838
Dr. Sharat?

20:59.925 --> 21:01.426
The satellite's telemetry
must still be off.

21:01.469 --> 21:02.584
Still?

21:02.636 --> 21:03.967
Fargo didn't tell you?

21:04.764 --> 21:06.470
We had a meeting.
He didn't show up.

Just give me
a few minutes.

Dr. Stark, a word?

21:15.483 --> 21:17.974
So I understand you spoke
to Douglas Fargo this morning?

21:18.068 --> 21:20.605

If you find him, shoot him.

21:20.696 --> 21:22.106

21:22.782 --> 21:24.773

21:35.878 --> 21:37.834
No, I don't want
to hear it.

21:38.088 --> 21:39.589
Jo, I need you to get
down to Cafe Diem.

Vincent disappeared
during the lunch rush.

Jo?

Okay, today is officially
Missing Persons Day,

21:50.976 --> 21:52.261
but you don't want
to hear it.

21:52.603 --> 21:55.219
A day or two
of quiet wasn't
an unreasonable request.

21:56.190 --> 21:58.226
Look, Nathan,
you need an ally
on the Defense Committee.

21:58.317 --> 22:01.400
I'm ready to be that ally,
but you've got to show me
something worthwhile.

22:01.487 --> 22:03.398
Then I will have that demo
ready for you shortly.

22:03.489 --> 22:04.695
Forget the demo.

22:05.282 --> 22:06.692
I'm talking
about Section Five.

22:08.494 --> 22:11.486
Access to Section Five
is by special clearance only.

22:11.580 --> 22:12.956
Which you can give me.

22:13.874 --> 22:17.787
Nathan, I want you
to get your funding,

22:18.879 --> 22:22.042
but I'm not
just going to rubber stamp
a multi-billion dollar budget

22:22.132 --> 22:23.838
like my predecessors have,

22:23.926 --> 22:28.010
and I can't,
in good conscience, support
something I've never seen.

22:29.265 --> 22:30.505
It's that simple.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.600
There you are.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.102
I've been trying
to raise you
all morning.

22:41.193 --> 22:42.353
I've got it under control.

22:42.444 --> 22:43.695
(LAUGHING) Really?

22:43.779 --> 22:46.521
Because every time
I turn around, someone else
has gone missing.

22:47.157 --> 22:48.693
There's Fargo,
now Vincent.

22:48.742 --> 22:51.154
Look, I know, and I know
what needs to be done.

22:51.203 --> 22:54.195
What I don't know
is why you insist on
telling me how to do it.

22:54.248 --> 22:55.363
What is your problem?

22:55.416 --> 22:57.077
My problem is you.

22:57.376 --> 23:00.209
Sheriff Cobb treated me
like a partner,
not an appendage.

23:00.296 --> 23:03.379
When something
goes wrong around here,
people look to me.

23:03.424 --> 23:05.540
They don't know you.
They don't trust you.

23:05.634 --> 23:09.468
Because you don't trust me.
You've been on a tear
since day one.

23:09.555 --> 23:11.045
I think you need to back off.

23:11.140 --> 23:13.597
Okay, I'm sorry
you're pissed because
you didn't get the job,

23:13.684 --> 23:15.640
but right now,
I really don't care.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.389
We have to find
these people,
and I know,

23:17.438 --> 23:20.930
we're going to,
but we have to work
together, okay?

23:21.025 --> 23:22.231
Are you with me?

23:26.947 --> 23:30.314
All right,
we'll work together.

23:31.201 --> 23:34.159
Okay, good.

23:35.581 --> 23:36.741
So we're okay?

23:39.084 --> 23:42.076
Yeah, we're okay.

Okay.

23:53.223 --> 23:54.679
Carter, wake up!

23:59.521 --> 24:00.852
What the hell are you doing?

24:00.940 --> 24:02.180
What am I doing?

24:02.274 --> 24:03.889
I found it
out by the crop circle.

24:03.943 --> 24:07.151
I think Spencer spent
the whole night rolling it
over the fields to make them.

24:07.237 --> 24:09.273
That explains
why his hands
are so messed up.

24:09.365 --> 24:10.400
It's a little difficult
to breathe

24:10.449 --> 24:12.986
with you camped out
on my diaphragm.

24:13.077 --> 24:14.533
Right. Sorry.

24:15.663 --> 24:16.698
You all right?

24:16.789 --> 24:17.824
Yeah.

24:18.707 --> 24:19.696
(GROANING)

24:22.169 --> 24:25.036
Jo. It was Jo.

24:28.467 --> 24:29.627
Jo hit you?

24:29.718 --> 24:34.462
Yeah, with the butt of an
MPS auto-assault—12 shotgun,

24:35.099 --> 24:38.887
or a model 50
tactical-takedown rifle.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.639
Damn, I'm never
gonna pass the test.

24:45.651 --> 24:46.811
Oh, no.

24:56.161 --> 24:57.492
Oh, no.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.570
Tell me
this wasn't filled
with weapons.

24:59.665 --> 25:00.825
No. No, it wasn't.

25:00.874 --> 25:02.125
You're lying to me,
aren't you?
Oh, big time.

25:02.167 --> 25:03.202
What is going on?

25:03.293 --> 25:04.624
Well, let's see.

25:04.670 --> 25:06.160
Spencer thinks
aliens have landed.

25:06.213 --> 25:09.125
Vincent and Fargo are missing,
and Jo is gone

25:09.425 --> 25:10.665
GI. Joe.

25:10.718 --> 25:11.958
You think
they're all together?

25:12.011 --> 25:14.423
I think they were together
at Spencer's party,

25:14.513 --> 25:16.344
and something happened.

25:16.432 --> 25:19.219
Either that
or we are being invaded
by aliens.

25:20.519 --> 25:21.975
Henry, please tell me
you don't believe in aliens.

25:22.021 --> 25:23.636
No, I believe
in Occam's razor.

25:23.689 --> 25:26.726
It's the basis for
methodological reductionism.

25:26.817 --> 25:28.307
Oh, yeah. Slowly.
Still dizzy.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.772
Okay, given two equally
predictive theories,

25:30.863 --> 25:32.569
you choose the one
that has fewer assumptions.

25:32.656 --> 25:35.193
So a tree has fallen
in the forest after a storm.

25:35.242 --> 25:36.448
The first hypothesis
holds that

25:36.535 --> 25:37.900
that tree was blown down
by the storm.

25:37.995 --> 25:40.486
The second, rival hypothesis
claims that

25:40.539 --> 25:44.248
that storm forced
an alien spaceship
to crash into the tree. See?

25:44.334 --> 25:47.076
No. I need to look closer
at Spencer's trailer.

25:47.171 --> 25:48.377
I'll go.

25:50.049 --> 25:52.005
Okay. That'll give me
a chance to get
over to Beverly's.

25:52.051 --> 25:53.131
What for?

25:53.218 --> 25:55.800
I've got four people
who are probably together
and definitely armed.

25:55.888 --> 25:58.755
Spencer's the missing member
of that team, and they
probably want him back.

25:58.849 --> 25:59.884
Be careful.

25:59.933 --> 26:01.059
You, too.

26:07.608 --> 26:09.394
COMPUTER:
Welcome to Section Five.

26:09.443 --> 26:11.058
We're doing
the right thing, Dr. Stark.

26:11.153 --> 26:12.188
l'm counting on it.

26:12.237 --> 26:15.320
Step onto the grid
for identity veriﬁcation.

26:28.504 --> 26:29.584
That's a radiation symbol.

26:29.630 --> 26:31.791
Once you enter the chamber,
we'll breach containment.

26:31.882 --> 26:34.248
You'll have 15 seconds
to view the artifact.

26:34.343 --> 26:36.629
Any longer, we'll exceed
exposure limits.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.090
You're not going in
with me?

26:39.181 --> 26:40.796
We could only
afford one suit.

Opening the doors now.

27:32.401 --> 27:35.359
NA THAN: Our tests
have conﬁrmed that
it is terrestrial in origin.

27:35.445 --> 27:37.436
We just can't ﬁgure out
who created it.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.490
Oh, my God.

27:43.495 --> 27:44.655
That's one theory.

27:45.330 --> 27:49.699
Then we strike,
hard and fast.

27:50.794 --> 27:52.409
Your basic grab-and-go.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.582
He won't be alone,
so watch your asses.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.004
Move out.

27:57.801 --> 28:01.134
Okay, so what makes you
think Jo and the others
are coming for Spencer?

28:01.180 --> 28:02.670
Occam's razor.

28:02.890 --> 28:05.097
You're spending
way too much time
with Henry.

28:06.977 --> 28:08.513
I borrowed this
from Section Four.

28:08.604 --> 28:10.344
I want to stop them,
not vaporize them.

28:10.439 --> 28:12.555
It's a PEP,
pulse-energy projectile rifle.

28:12.649 --> 28:15.186
It's for crowd control.
Completely non-lethal.

28:15.903 --> 28:16.983
Did you pass
that weapons test?

28:17.029 --> 28:18.064
It's not that hard, Carter.

28:18.155 --> 28:19.190
Allison, Sheriff,
what is going on?

28:19.239 --> 28:20.274
Where's Spencer?

28:20.365 --> 28:21.821
Inside, and he's
getting worse.

28:22.659 --> 28:24.160
What happened
to your head?

28:24.203 --> 28:25.318
Had a trust issue.

28:25.746 --> 28:27.111
Their leader is here.

28:28.207 --> 28:30.823
He looks human,
but it's just a guise.

28:31.251 --> 28:32.707
You can see it.

28:32.753 --> 28:33.993
Hideous.

28:34.129 --> 28:35.665
Under the skin.

28:36.673 --> 28:39.540
We will not let
anything happen
to you, Spencer.

28:39.593 --> 28:40.878
Will we, Sheriff?

28:40.969 --> 28:42.709
No. I can stay positioned
in the foyer.

28:42.804 --> 28:43.884
Allison, why don't you
take the back

28:43.931 --> 28:45.592
and PEP the hell
out of anything
that comes from behind?

28:45.682 --> 28:46.717
Okay.

28:48.769 --> 28:51.556
He picked Eureka
for a reason.

28:51.855 --> 28:52.890
He?

28:54.399 --> 28:55.900
He can't be trusted.

28:57.152 --> 29:00.064
l... I need to...
I need to go.

29:01.573 --> 29:04.155
We have to capture
and interrogate him.

29:04.660 --> 29:06.150
He must be stopped.

29:06.245 --> 29:07.405
Who?

29:07.704 --> 29:09.410
Their leader.

29:09.498 --> 29:12.285
He's infiltrated
our government,
and now he's here,

29:12.376 --> 29:13.991
hiding in plain sight.

29:16.296 --> 29:17.331
Oh, jeez.

29:17.422 --> 29:18.628
ALLISON: What?

29:20.300 --> 29:22.336
He's talking
about the Congressman.

29:23.762 --> 29:24.922
He is?

29:25.472 --> 29:27.087
Spencer's not their target.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.465
Faraday is.

29:31.436 --> 29:34.303
That... I don't even
know what to call it.

29:35.524 --> 29:36.980
It could change
everything.

29:38.110 --> 29:39.441
It already has.

29:53.542 --> 29:54.702
Fargo?

30:08.265 --> 30:09.630
What the hell are you...

30:10.976 --> 30:12.307
Have you lost your mind?

30:13.228 --> 30:14.308
Deputy!

30:14.771 --> 30:15.760
Fargo!

30:17.816 --> 30:19.056
Who are you people?

30:23.739 --> 30:25.604
The question is,
who are you?

30:25.657 --> 30:26.772
All right, that's...

31:02.361 --> 31:03.441
No.

31:04.988 --> 31:06.103
Nope.

31:09.242 --> 31:10.368
Aha.

31:13.789 --> 31:14.995
Call Carter.

31:17.334 --> 31:19.495
Henry, give us
some good news.

31:19.544 --> 31:22.377
They were watching
a movie called
They Came to Conquer.

31:22.422 --> 31:24.413
Don't tell me,
alien invasion.

31:24.508 --> 31:27.671
Invasion, abduction,
dissection. This movie's
got it all.

31:27.719 --> 31:29.880
Okay. Still,
it's a big leap

31:29.971 --> 31:31.552
from watching a movie
to thinking
it’s the real thing.

31:31.640 --> 31:33.255
ALLISON:
Yeah, but we 're talking
about Spencer here.

31:33.350 --> 31:35.432
I’m assuming he didn't
get this at Blockbuster.

31:35.519 --> 31:37.055
HENRY: Not even close.

31:38.605 --> 31:40.561
Looks like he hijacked
a satellite signal

31:40.649 --> 31:42.765
to intercept
a digital broadcast.

31:42.859 --> 31:45.145
Then he bounced the signal

31:46.905 --> 31:50.818
off a Global Dynamics
satellite to cover his tracks.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.194
Oh.

31:52.244 --> 31:54.155
"Oh." Is that a good "oh"
or a bad "oh"?

31:54.246 --> 31:56.737
HENRY: Now, the number
of the satellite is 60-85.

31:56.832 --> 31:57.821
Oh, no.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.827
Don't tell me. That's
the one that screwed up
your monkey test.

31:59.918 --> 32:02.910
They lost the satellite signal
for a few hours Friday night.
I'm assuming...

32:03.004 --> 32:04.414
Spencer got it.
Yeah.

32:06.133 --> 32:07.543
There's Nathan's car.

32:07.592 --> 32:08.798
Henry, we gotta go.

32:21.982 --> 32:23.097
Nathan.

32:24.109 --> 32:25.144
Are you all right?

32:25.235 --> 32:27.772
Hey, buddy.
Stay down. Stay.

32:27.863 --> 32:28.978
What happened?

32:29.072 --> 32:30.312
Yeah, I'm gonna get
you some help.

32:30.991 --> 32:32.606
Taggan,

32:32.701 --> 32:36.694
his deputy and my assistant
took Faraday.

32:36.788 --> 32:38.949
Yeah, they're infected
with your paranoia-inducing
monkey beam.

32:39.040 --> 32:41.952
No, impossible.
They were sent from a secure
Global Dynamics satellite.

32:42.002 --> 32:44.459
No, possible.
Spencer hacked into it.

32:44.713 --> 32:45.919
If anything happens
to Faraday...

32:45.964 --> 32:48.250
CARTER: Well, it won't,
now that we know
where they took him.

32:48.633 --> 32:49.713
Where did they take him?

32:49.801 --> 32:52.133
Well, where would you go
if you were about to do
an autopsy on an alien?

No, you're not.

A crazy cabal is
about to dissect
a US Congressman. I am.

33:00.353 --> 33:01.889
They're not crazy.
They're paranoid,

33:01.980 --> 33:03.686
and if they see
a bunch of people
with weapons,

33:03.773 --> 33:05.559
this is gonna be
a Waco really fast.

33:05.650 --> 33:07.311
My point exactly.

33:07.861 --> 33:09.772
They're armed
and dangerous.

33:10.280 --> 33:11.395
I don't see
any other choice.

33:11.490 --> 33:14.277
Can't you just reverse
the paranoid thing?

by the time
I'm done with you,

I don't like this
any better than you do,

to that Congressman,

what do you think
is gonna happen to Eureka?

to talk to them.

I can't risk it.

If that's the way
this has to be.

your cooperation, Sheriff.

In which aliens invade
a small, bucolic town
in the Pacific Northwest.

was Congressman Faraday's

38:18.630 --> 38:22.122
Spencer bounced the movie
off a Global Dynamics
weapons satellite

38:22.217 --> 38:25.675
that was being used
to beam waves of paranoia
into lab monkeys.

38:29.474 --> 38:32.181
There was a malfunction,
wasn't there, Fargo?

38:33.311 --> 38:34.551

bounced the signal,

Hold your fire!

39:54.767 --> 39:58.009
Hold fire!
Everyone, stand down!
MAN 1: Hold yourfire!

39:58.730 --> 40:00.220
MAN 2: Someone's coming out.

40:00.273 --> 40:01.854
WOMAN: Weapons down!

40:02.775 --> 40:05.152
MAN 3: Stand down! Stand down!

40:05.236 --> 40:08.444
CARTER: They're unarmed!
Everybody's okay.
MAN 4: Hold your fire!

40:08.573 --> 40:09.858
MAN 5: Copy that. Let's go!

40:10.241 --> 40:12.232
WOMAN ON RADIO:
Coming out.
MAN 5: Talk to us!

40:12.285 --> 40:13.400
Come on! Come on!

40:19.667 --> 40:20.782
So everybody's okay?

40:20.877 --> 40:22.663
Oh, no,
they're freaking bug-nuts.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.415
Restraints, now.
Right away.

40:28.676 --> 40:29.836
MAN: It's clear!

40:33.264 --> 40:36.301
(PEACEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)

40:49.948 --> 40:53.361
We reprogrammed the signal
to stimulate
the brain's pleasure center.

40:53.451 --> 40:58.787
I chose delivery footage
each should find benign
and peaceful.

41:00.541 --> 41:01.872
Well, you sure know Jo.

41:03.753 --> 41:07.666
Congressman, I trust
this unfortunate incident

41:07.757 --> 41:10.294
in no way will affect
our budget considerations?

41:10.385 --> 41:12.376
l was abducted,
threatened and humiliated

41:12.470 --> 41:16.213
by your people,
in your town,
on your watch,

41:18.142 --> 41:22.476
but in spite of this incident,
what I saw in there yesterday
takes precedence.

41:23.189 --> 41:25.976
Dr. Stark,
we'll be talking.

41:26.067 --> 41:27.398
I'm sure we will.

41:29.487 --> 41:30.693
Miss Blake.

41:34.492 --> 41:36.107
So are we funded?

41:36.160 --> 41:37.195
For now.

41:38.746 --> 41:40.828
lguess
I owe you one, Sheriff,

41:41.416 --> 41:44.078
for getting
the Congressman out
relatively unscathed.

41:44.168 --> 41:48.002
A big one.
Thank you, Carter.

41:52.885 --> 41:55.922
By the way,
ldidn't do it for you.

42:00.435 --> 42:01.641
You don't say.

42:04.022 --> 42:06.388
Multi-ve/ocity
XK exterminator.

42:06.482 --> 42:07.688
Very good.

42:07.734 --> 42:09.645
BMFG liquidator.

42:09.902 --> 42:11.108
And size of magazine?

42:11.195 --> 42:13.686
Trick question. It uses
a single-chamber artillery.

42:13.948 --> 42:15.154
Wow, Carter,

42:15.199 --> 42:16.700
keep this up,
and you're gonna pass
the exam.

42:16.743 --> 42:19.860
Yeah, I don't know.
I tend to choke the exam.

42:20.788 --> 42:22.403
Well, this is the exam.

42:22.957 --> 42:26.120
The manual didn't say
anything about it having
to be written, so I...

42:29.797 --> 42:31.082
Thanks for the tutoring.

42:32.091 --> 42:33.467
Don't mention it.

42:36.345 --> 42:37.551
(PHONE RINGING)

42:42.268 --> 42:43.553
You gonna get that?

42:47.356 --> 42:48.641
ldidn't think so.

42:51.402 --> 42:52.437
Jack Carter.
