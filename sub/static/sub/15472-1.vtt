00:38.208 --> 00:41.208
It's easy to become a facade.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.708
Maybe especially
when you're a pastor.

00:46.208 --> 00:49.083
But I know for me...

00:49.083 --> 00:52.083
the public persona...

00:54.083 --> 00:56.083
you can believe that.

00:58.583 --> 01:02.083
And the private person...

01:02.083 --> 01:04.083
becomes something else.

01:06.125 --> 01:13.500
And the result is always pain.

Indiana has

02:59.208 --> 03:01.667
for, um, like
high school diploma,

03:01.667 --> 03:04.625
no college,
of, like, 26%.

03:04.625 --> 03:05.625
Oh, wow.

03:05.625 --> 03:07.125
Yeah, it's really bad,

03:07.125 --> 03:08.125
and so I tried
to get a job,

03:08.167 --> 03:10.667
I tried to get a job,
I couldn't.

03:10.667 --> 03:12.583
I couldn't get a job,
couldn't get a job,

03:12.583 --> 03:14.667
and so I read an article,

03:14.667 --> 03:18.083
said there's boatloads
of work in North Dakota.

03:18.125 --> 03:19.625
Boatloads.

03:19.625 --> 03:22.042
My dad said, "Well, um...

03:22.042 --> 03:24.958
"I can get some money
from grandma, and I'll
loan you some.

03:24.958 --> 03:27.458
I'll get you
a one-way ticket there."

03:27.458 --> 03:29.333
You know?
And it's just--

03:29.333 --> 03:33.875
It's been trial after trial.

03:33.875 --> 03:36.917
And I'm just at
the end of my rope.

03:36.917 --> 03:39.417
You can get a job,

03:39.417 --> 03:41.542
but you gotta translate
into housing.

03:41.542 --> 03:43.125
And that's the--
that's the killer.

03:43.625 --> 03:46.000
Rents have tripled
and quadrupled.

03:46.500 --> 03:49.542
People who have lived here
all their lives happen to leave.

03:49.500 --> 03:52.500
And other people
who own property

03:52.500 --> 03:54.000
just don't like the changes
and they're leaving.

03:54.542 --> 03:55.542
They're selling it.

03:55.542 --> 03:57.042
But everything's
expensive.

03:57.042 --> 03:58.500
It's very expensive
right now, you know?

03:58.500 --> 04:03.000
So it is legal to sleep
in your car in Williston,

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
but you can only sleep
where people give you
permission to sleep,

04:05.500 --> 04:07.875
and there's not very many places
that do.

04:07.875 --> 04:10.250
Anyway, so--so you can stay
for a month,

04:10.250 --> 04:13.042
and unless there's a problem,
we do ask a gift.

04:13.542 --> 04:15.042
We don't charge this.

04:15.042 --> 04:16.333
We're not a shelter.

04:16.333 --> 04:17.666
This is a place
for men to get jobs.

04:17.666 --> 04:19.666
Now real quick I'm going to run
through these rules, ok?

04:19.666 --> 04:20.958
First we're at church.

04:20.958 --> 04:22.041
If you're not going to church
someplace else,

04:22.542 --> 04:23.542
I'd like you to come to church.

04:23.542 --> 04:24.542
I think it's only polite, ok?

04:24.542 --> 04:26.042
I don't know what
your church background is.

04:26.042 --> 04:27.042
We might have a chance
to do that,

04:27.042 --> 04:28.667
but we do background checks
here, ok?

04:29.125 --> 04:30.917
No weapons, no fighting,
no profanity.

04:30.917 --> 04:32.250
You want to stay
on my good side,

04:32.250 --> 04:33.750
don't spill coffee
on the carpet.

04:33.750 --> 04:37.250
Drives me crazy when people
spill coffee on the carpet,

04:37.250 --> 04:39.750
because--because
that becomes evidence.

04:39.750 --> 04:41.750
"There's a man staying
in the building,"

04:41.750 --> 04:43.083
you know what I'm saying?

04:43.125 --> 04:45.542
800 or 900 guys
come through this building.

04:45.542 --> 04:47.375
And you know it's a struggle
we've got, it really is.

04:47.375 --> 04:48.375
Did you get
yours signed?

04:48.375 --> 04:49.875
Oh, no, I haven't.

04:49.875 --> 04:50.875
Ok. So welcome to
Williston, gentlemen.

04:51.167 --> 04:53.417
It's gonna be a trip.

04:57.542 --> 04:59.542
What a profound thing.

04:59.542 --> 05:04.000
That we have people literally
walking up to our door

05:04.500 --> 05:09.458
from all over the world,
saying, "Can you help me?"

05:11.542 --> 05:15.042
WOMAN: We are on our way
to Williston, North Dakota,

05:15.042 --> 05:16.917
hopefully to find jobs.

05:16.875 --> 05:18.708
MAN: We're here
in DeLand, Florida,

05:18.750 --> 05:22.167
destination, uh, North Dakota.

05:22.167 --> 05:25.625
DIFFERENT MAN: I got
my co-pilot, Artie.

05:26.125 --> 05:27.500
Say hi, Artie.

05:33.625 --> 05:38.667
DIFFERENT MAN:
Gonna go out there and try
to find an oil-rigging job.

05:38.667 --> 05:39.958
I spoke to a buddy of mine,

05:40.458 --> 05:42.750
and he said he's making
6 figures out there.

05:51.542 --> 05:53.875
I'll find a job within an hour
or two, he said.

05:55.250 --> 05:56.917
JAY REINKE:
I have to respect these men

05:56.917 --> 06:00.167
because I've asked myself,
"What would I do

06:00.167 --> 06:03.083
if I got off a bus
and I had to find a job?"

06:05.458 --> 06:07.458
And these men do it.

06:13.458 --> 06:16.417
MAN:
I don't know about going back
home, but this is where it's at.

06:16.417 --> 06:19.667
$15 an hour is minimum wage
up here.

06:19.667 --> 06:21.458
15 bucks.

06:21.458 --> 06:23.917
You're not gonna find this
nowhere in America.

06:23.917 --> 06:26.417
People with 10 felonies
is getting 100 grand a year

06:26.917 --> 06:28.375
just 'cause you tough enough.

06:33.208 --> 06:35.542
I really have no desire
to leave sunny Arizona

06:35.542 --> 06:37.542
to go up to the cold
of North Dakota,

06:37.542 --> 06:41.083
but I don't have
a whole lot of choice.

06:41.125 --> 06:44.667
MAN: This may be some point
of hope for everybody.

06:44.667 --> 06:48.000
DIFFERENT MAN:
We've already rented out
a travel trailer

06:48.000 --> 06:50.500
because we know that
space up there is limited.

06:56.167 --> 07:00.875
I can't afford to live.
Plain and simple.

07:00.875 --> 07:03.208
JAY:
It's very hard to have someone

07:03.208 --> 07:06.667
stand in your office
and say, "I have nowhere to go."

07:06.667 --> 07:09.500
And to say,
"Sorry, I can't help."

07:09.500 --> 07:11.417
I've got floor space.

07:28.083 --> 07:29.833
[Singing indistinctly]

07:38.375 --> 07:41.250
REINKE:
The Christian ethic is now,

07:41.542 --> 07:44.625
who is my neighbor
and how do I serve him?

07:44.625 --> 07:46.042
People without a place to sleep.

07:46.042 --> 07:49.375
There's a neighbor in Williston
looking at how to serve him.

07:49.375 --> 07:54.708
Not only are these men
my neighbor,

07:55.042 --> 07:59.708
but people who don't want them
here are also my neighbor.

08:02.125 --> 08:04.875
The whole overnight thing
wasn't really planned.

08:04.875 --> 08:08.542
The congregation never really
did decide to do this,

08:08.542 --> 08:11.500
and that's probably
one of the chief criticisms

08:11.500 --> 08:13.875
that I have to bear.

08:24.167 --> 08:27.667
WOMAN: It started out
with one guy about a year ago,

08:27.667 --> 08:30.625
and it's just kind of gotten
to be a lot more.

08:30.625 --> 08:33.082
It's not something we really
just talked about and said,

08:33.082 --> 08:34.582
"Oh, yeah, why don't we
do this."

08:34.582 --> 08:36.042
It just kind of happened.

08:36.042 --> 08:40.582
People come and they have needs,
and you want to help them.

08:40.582 --> 08:43.082
When you start getting
too many people in the building,

08:43.082 --> 08:47.000
it just--it's a little bit
harder to maintain,

08:47.000 --> 08:50.417
The organization and keep things
clean and everything.

08:50.417 --> 08:53.083
And that can be a concern
for the congregation.

08:53.125 --> 08:56.208
WOMAN: It's put a strain
on our family life

08:56.208 --> 08:58.792
because for the most part,
my husband's had to be here

08:58.792 --> 09:00.792
every night and every morning.

09:00.792 --> 09:02.917
WOMAN:
Which is kind of a bummer,

09:02.917 --> 09:06.500
but you know, he tries to make
as much time as possible

09:07.000 --> 09:09.375
to serve everywhere
he needs to serve.

09:09.917 --> 09:12.917
ANDREA REINKE:
Everybody who comes here
says, "You don't know.

09:12.917 --> 09:15.750
Everybody's talking about
coming to Williston."

09:15.750 --> 09:21.000
Hopefully at some point
we'll transition back
to how it used to be.

09:32.625 --> 09:34.250
JAY: I don't know
of any other parallel.

09:34.250 --> 09:35.792
There's been boom towns,

09:35.833 --> 09:37.792
but it hasn't had this kind
of depressed economy

09:37.792 --> 09:41.042
that's putting the pressure
for people to go somewhere

09:41.042 --> 09:43.000
the way this one is.

09:44.333 --> 09:48.625
It's happening in
a relatively small community,

09:48.625 --> 09:53.792
so the impact of the migration,
it's just evident everywhere.

09:57.375 --> 10:00.833
Thanks very much.
Ok, we'll see you.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.500
MAN:
I'm not sure if it's legal.

10:17.500 --> 10:20.417
I don't know if you are even
aware of some of this.

10:20.417 --> 10:22.833
We're just trying to make our
point why we need
to do something.

10:22.833 --> 10:24.833
This is a great example
of what we're seeing

10:24.833 --> 10:26.375
in single family
residential areas.

10:26.875 --> 10:29.708
This area here
is near the baseball field.

10:29.708 --> 10:31.667
We've got 3 campers
in a backyard.

10:31.667 --> 10:34.458
One's a motor home,
the other two are pull-behinds.

10:34.458 --> 10:37.625
That's not acceptable.
That's not a safe environment.

10:37.625 --> 10:40.000
This is a health concern.
It's a safety concern.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.125
And that is why the city
needs to do something.

10:42.125 --> 10:45.875
JAY:
Tonight's city council meeting
will be the first formal vote

10:45.875 --> 10:48.417
on an RV ban.

10:48.375 --> 10:52.375
It will mean that
RVs and campers

10:52.375 --> 10:54.250
cannot have people
living in them

10:54.292 --> 10:57.083
for more than 28 days
in a year.

10:57.042 --> 10:58.375
That scares me.

10:58.375 --> 11:00.875
I've been in town a long time.

11:00.875 --> 11:05.875
I hate to take the role
of the antagonist,

11:05.875 --> 11:07.833
but I think somebody
needs to turn some rocks over

11:07.833 --> 11:09.833
and say, "So what is community
in this place?

11:09.833 --> 11:10.833
What are we gonna do here?"

11:11.083 --> 11:13.750
MAN: We asked for public input.

11:13.750 --> 11:15.917
Pastor Reinke.

11:15.917 --> 11:17.667
Thank you, Mayor Poser.

11:17.667 --> 11:20.000
I would speak against
the adoption of this
ordinance.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.333
I believe that Williston
needs to take a step

11:23.333 --> 11:26.333
that says the people
arriving on our doorstep

11:26.833 --> 11:28.333
are gifts to us,

11:28.333 --> 11:30.833
and though there's a burden
in receiving them as a gift,

11:30.833 --> 11:32.875
to welcome them.

11:32.833 --> 11:37.750
I also believe that
by passing such an ordinance

11:37.750 --> 11:40.833
we risk serving fear,

11:40.833 --> 11:43.333
the fear of the people
coming at us,

11:43.333 --> 11:47.042
and the last thing we need to do
is to serve our fear.

11:47.042 --> 11:48.917
Ok, thank you, Pastor.

11:54.833 --> 11:57.125
WOMAN: So our top story,
the FBI says it believes

11:57.125 --> 11:59.417
it has uncovered the body of
missing teacher Sherry Arnold.

11:59.417 --> 12:02.250
MAN: And federal
and multi-state law enforcement

12:02.250 --> 12:04.583
discovered a woman's body
east of Williston,
North Dakota,

12:04.583 --> 12:06.458
some time yesterday.

12:06.417 --> 12:07.750
The 43-year-old
high school math teacher

12:07.750 --> 12:11.042
went for a jog
and never returned.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.458
MAN: This morning investigators
say the know a lot more

12:12.458 --> 12:14.458
about the two men they believe
kidnapped her.

12:14.458 --> 12:16.250
They may driven through

12:16.292 --> 12:18.583
the popular high school
teacher's hometown

12:18.792 --> 12:21.792
hoping to find jobs
in the booming oil industry.

12:21.833 --> 12:23.708
Arnold's disappearance
is fueling tensions

12:23.708 --> 12:26.792
between locals and the flood
of out-of-towners.

12:26.792 --> 12:31.083
This normally peaceful town
is living in fear.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.292
JAY: The Sherry Arnold case
was huge,

12:33.292 --> 12:36.542
and it made us suspicious
in ways...

12:37.042 --> 12:39.458
that I don't think
we would have been.

12:40.833 --> 12:43.708
It really does intensify
the fear.

12:43.708 --> 12:47.042
Everybody's afraid
of the newcomer.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.583
Very specifically
the overnighters are not welcome
in this part of our community,

12:55.583 --> 13:01.708
and what scares me is that
good men are vulnerable.

13:01.708 --> 13:05.000
We've had people sleeping
in our parking lot

13:05.000 --> 13:07.417
for sometimes over a month.

13:07.417 --> 13:09.417
They're waiting to come
in the building.

Now, something we have to
really, really be mindful of,

13:12.542 --> 13:16.000
people, when they see
the new men in town,

13:16.000 --> 13:19.333
they wonder--
and we're a church,

13:19.333 --> 13:21.292
this is a place
where sinners should come--

13:21.292 --> 13:24.458
but it is
a very difficult PR issue,

13:24.458 --> 13:27.042
because from
a neighbor's perspective,

13:27.042 --> 13:28.958
they could perceive us
as harboring somebody

13:28.917 --> 13:31.417
who could hurt their child.

13:31.458 --> 13:35.750
If you feel like people regard
you with a little bit of...

13:35.708 --> 13:40.000
distance, love 'em anyway.

a community here,

I had a closed heart.

14:19.167 --> 14:21.167

anybody close to me.

I've overcome a lot of things

14:41.875 --> 14:43.750
in my past.

14:43.750 --> 14:45.542
I was a drunk and a drug addict,

14:45.542 --> 14:47.583
and you know,
I lived a bad life.

14:47.583 --> 14:50.625
I spent 16 years of my life
in prison.

14:50.625 --> 14:52.625

15:00.375 --> 15:02.375
MEZO: The pastor says
he trusts my judgment,

15:02.375 --> 15:05.875
and if I make a decision,
he'll run with it.

15:05.917 --> 15:08.417
And that's comforting.

15:08.417 --> 15:12.292
This is probably
the safest place
in Williston to be right now.

15:12.292 --> 15:14.917
To be out looking for work
and have your heads down.

15:14.917 --> 15:17.208
But anytime you're here,
you're safe

15:17.208 --> 15:19.500
and like to keep it that way.

15:19.500 --> 15:22.500
That's how we're going to be
able to continue doing this.

15:22.500 --> 15:24.000
It really meant a lot
to come to a place

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
that felt like I was welcome.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.500
I mean, this is the only place
that I came

"This is a home.

and there's sand on the pews,

in church.

that much truthfully.

stand around Sunday morning,

what to do.

17:03.042 --> 17:04.541

a little bit awkward,

in someone else's domain.

not going to get a job there.

So then you're going to be
working McDonald's, Hardee's,

to support them here

17:44.500 --> 17:46.000

no intention

17:47.958 --> 17:50.208

anything here.

how the "Herald" does stories.

24:28.125 --> 24:32.583
Its editorial decision
has inflamed the fear

24:32.583 --> 24:34.958
in this community.

24:41.542 --> 24:45.250
To be afraid of men walking
into your neighborhood,

24:45.250 --> 24:48.042
that's reasonable to a point.

24:48.042 --> 24:50.625
There is an uptick in crime.

24:50.625 --> 24:54.625
But if we could only find a way

24:54.625 --> 24:57.542
to let people meet
the overnighters,

24:57.542 --> 24:59.458
it would change us.

24:59.458 --> 25:03.208
Fear of the unknown
would be gone,

25:03.208 --> 25:06.833
and we would become
a community.

25:10.708 --> 25:11.708
Hello.

25:11.708 --> 25:13.250
WOMAN: Hi.

25:13.208 --> 25:14.208
I'm Pastor Reinke
from next door.

25:14.208 --> 25:15.708
Hi.
Hi. Ha ha!

25:15.708 --> 25:16.708
How are you?

25:16.708 --> 25:17.667
I'm doing well.

25:17.667 --> 25:18.708
I'm here with
an invitation.

25:18.708 --> 25:20.208
Ok.

25:20.250 --> 25:21.667
You know we got guys
staying at the church.

25:21.667 --> 25:23.208
Yes.

25:23.167 --> 25:24.167
But we'd like to just
invite neighbors

25:24.667 --> 25:26.167
to just sort of
see the guys.

25:26.667 --> 25:27.667
It's not
a meeting about--

25:27.667 --> 25:29.667
But it's an invitation
just to pray

25:29.708 --> 25:32.000
and read scripture
and sing some hymns.

25:32.000 --> 25:32.833
Hello!
Hi.

25:33.333 --> 25:34.833
I'm Pastor Reinke
from next door.

25:34.833 --> 25:35.833
Yes.
Ok.

25:35.833 --> 25:38.333
Hey, I have
an invitation.

25:38.333 --> 25:39.583
[Man, indistinct]

25:39.583 --> 25:40.875
Yes, yes, yes.

25:40.875 --> 25:43.375
Well, why do you got all
them trash over there?

25:43.375 --> 25:45.875
Well, um...

25:45.875 --> 25:46.875
No, don't explain.

25:46.875 --> 25:48.875
Don't distract it.

25:48.875 --> 25:49.875
Ok.

25:49.875 --> 25:52.375
Everybody says
they're homeless.

25:52.375 --> 25:53.875
Homeless my ass.

25:53.875 --> 25:55.375
They're making
big money.

25:55.375 --> 25:56.875
Actually some of
these people aren't,

25:56.875 --> 26:00.375
and I had one gentleman
in the parking lot
just last week

26:00.375 --> 26:02.875
who just lost his home
in South Carolina.

26:02.875 --> 26:04.375
That's his problem.

26:04.375 --> 26:05.917
It is his problem,

26:05.875 --> 26:07.875
and I'm trying to
help him is all.

26:08.375 --> 26:09.875
So...ok, ok.
Thanks.

26:09.875 --> 26:10.875
Thank you.

26:10.875 --> 26:11.875
Good night.
God bless.

26:14.500 --> 26:17.500
Here's a gentlemen
just called them trash.

26:17.500 --> 26:20.000
Not to judge people
by appearances,

26:20.417 --> 26:25.083
a man with no teeth,
living with his daughter,

26:25.083 --> 26:29.375
calling other people
who have needs trash.

26:30.875 --> 26:32.375
MAN: Pastor Reinke!

26:32.375 --> 26:34.708
How we doing?

26:34.708 --> 26:36.542
I have to admit,
sometimes I do
have some concerns.

26:36.542 --> 26:37.958
My college kids are
home for the summer,

26:37.958 --> 26:39.542
and so I have
a 20-year-old daughter,

26:40.042 --> 26:42.417
so my anxiety levels
go up.

26:42.417 --> 26:43.833
JAY:
We're not quite sure,

26:43.833 --> 26:45.750
but we're looking
at possibly asking people

26:45.750 --> 26:47.667
to stay out of
the parking lot
until 8:00 at night.

26:47.667 --> 26:48.625
Ok.

26:49.167 --> 26:52.333
I think that would give
some comfort to, um...

26:52.833 --> 26:55.667
to the neighbors.

26:55.667 --> 26:56.458
Yes.

26:56.958 --> 26:57.958
The one other thing is

26:57.958 --> 26:58.958
we are going to call
a moratorium

26:59.458 --> 27:01.958
on people that have
Kiss seat covers.

27:01.958 --> 27:03.458
If you're going
to have that,

27:03.458 --> 27:05.958
I think you need to find
another church.

27:07.958 --> 27:10.458
Well, you wouldn't want
to see me

27:10.458 --> 27:11.958
dressed up
as Gene Simmons.

27:11.958 --> 27:13.458
I wouldn't.

27:13.958 --> 27:14.958
Believe me,
that would be
the end of it.

27:14.958 --> 27:15.958
We wouldn't do that.

27:16.458 --> 27:17.958
And my other suggestion,

27:17.958 --> 27:18.958
And my other suggestion,
I say this all the time.

27:18.958 --> 27:20.417
Cut the hair.
I'm serious.

27:20.917 --> 27:22.958
I am serious.
Very serious.

27:22.958 --> 27:24.625
That's not a requirement,
but I got to tell you,

27:24.583 --> 27:26.667
appearance
means something.

27:26.708 --> 27:29.708
Did Jesus have
short hair?

27:29.708 --> 27:32.625
Jesus doesn't have
our neighbors.

27:32.625 --> 27:35.000
I cannot promise you
a place in the building,
I'm sorry.

27:35.042 --> 27:37.042
The fact is,
you have a vehicle.

27:37.042 --> 27:38.542
Many people
don't even have that.

27:38.542 --> 27:40.042
[Indistinct]

27:40.042 --> 27:41.417
They don't have a car.

27:41.417 --> 27:42.792
And I did let--

27:42.792 --> 27:46.292
I got Jamie in that car
and her--John, the guy--

27:46.292 --> 27:48.167
I let him back
in the building.

27:48.167 --> 27:50.958
Ok. Ok. Write it down
somewhere,

27:50.958 --> 27:52.542
or I'll forget
about it, ok?

27:52.542 --> 27:53.542
I'll do it.

27:53.542 --> 27:55.042
All right, ok.
Ok, thanks.

27:55.042 --> 27:57.042
Good night.
God bless.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.792
Come on, go black!

28:31.792 --> 28:32.792
Aw!

28:32.792 --> 28:34.042
Come on, dogfish!

28:34.042 --> 28:35.500
[Engine revs]

28:35.500 --> 28:38.000
Woo!

28:38.000 --> 28:40.417
Ha ha!
Ha ha!

28:51.625 --> 28:54.000
Just cut the line
and let him go.

28:54.458 --> 28:55.458
No, just cut...

28:56.000 --> 28:57.875
Cut--cut--

28:57.875 --> 28:59.208
Do you want to wander around
with a hook in your face?

28:59.208 --> 29:01.250
No, other side
of it, man.

29:02.208 --> 29:03.750
Oh.

29:06.750 --> 29:08.750
Fly away, buddy.

29:09.208 --> 29:10.250
All right.

29:10.250 --> 29:13.125
That lady said
that you put bi--

29:13.125 --> 29:14.958
She said you put
bread on a string

29:14.958 --> 29:16.958
to catch a bird?

29:16.958 --> 29:18.458
Dude, I used to do
this shit in school
all the time.

29:18.458 --> 29:19.958
Yeah?

29:21.958 --> 29:23.500
Really?

29:25.125 --> 29:27.167
MAN: There's too much
anger in this town.

29:27.125 --> 29:28.500
There's too much fear.

29:28.500 --> 29:31.917
I mean, this is
the epitome of greed
right here,

29:31.917 --> 29:33.333
and that's why I want
to leave.

29:33.333 --> 29:34.833
It's not kind
to outsiders,

29:35.292 --> 29:36.792
I can see the reaction
of people.

29:36.833 --> 29:38.667
They look at me like
I'm an illegal alien.

29:38.667 --> 29:40.000
I think Williston
could be

29:40.000 --> 29:42.500
one of the best things
to ever happen to you.

29:42.500 --> 29:44.500
I do.

29:44.500 --> 29:46.000
Uh...

29:46.042 --> 29:47.833
Don't give up.

29:47.833 --> 29:49.125
I think I'm
beyond redemption.

29:49.625 --> 29:50.708
I don't think reading
a few bible verses

29:50.708 --> 29:52.792
and hanging out
with some people
in church

29:52.792 --> 29:53.792
is gonna change
all that.

29:54.292 --> 29:55.292
But that's just me.

29:55.292 --> 29:57.292
No, you know what?
Do you know what?

29:57.292 --> 29:58.792
What, someone's gonna
adopt me and say,

29:59.250 --> 30:00.792
"Paul, we're gonna
graft you in here,

30:00.792 --> 30:02.292
you're like my family"?

30:02.292 --> 30:03.292
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

30:03.292 --> 30:04.750
I think this is
fantasyland.

30:04.750 --> 30:06.292
I live in reality,
in the real world.

30:06.292 --> 30:08.792
What about people
just loving you?

30:08.792 --> 30:10.292
When is that
gonna happen?

30:10.292 --> 30:11.792
I'm in my 40s now.

30:11.792 --> 30:12.792
When's that
gonna happen?

30:13.292 --> 30:15.208
I know this sounds
so hokey.

30:15.208 --> 30:17.875
But I want to love you.
I love you.

30:20.625 --> 30:22.375
But what is here for me?

30:22.375 --> 30:24.292
I am.
Opportunity? Employment?

30:24.292 --> 30:27.125
I know.
I am.

30:27.125 --> 30:28.958
You can come and have
a meal with my family.

30:29.458 --> 30:30.958
I don't think your wife
likes me, by the way.

30:30.958 --> 30:31.958
What?

30:31.958 --> 30:33.792
I sense it.

30:33.792 --> 30:35.083
I don't think
you should have me
over to your home.

30:35.083 --> 30:36.583
You might want to talk
to your wife--

30:36.583 --> 30:38.083
Why not?
Of course I want--

30:38.083 --> 30:39.083
We always have people
over at our home.

30:39.083 --> 30:40.583
You have to think about
your family first.

30:40.583 --> 30:43.083
You're a family guy.

30:59.583 --> 31:01.042
Hi.

31:01.083 --> 31:03.125
Hi. Who would I speak
to about an application

31:03.083 --> 31:05.583
for a truck driver?

31:05.583 --> 31:07.083
You are a driver?

31:07.125 --> 31:08.625
Yes.

31:08.625 --> 31:11.625
How many years
experience?

31:12.125 --> 31:13.625
About 8.

31:13.625 --> 31:14.958
Ok.

31:19.125 --> 31:22.167
I want to see if they have
"Been convicted of any felonies"

31:22.667 --> 31:24.000
on their application...

31:24.000 --> 31:25.875
that I've seen so far.

31:29.542 --> 31:33.208
MAN: It's definitely a place
for a second chance.

31:33.167 --> 31:35.250
I was at
the Wal-Mart parking lot,

31:35.750 --> 31:38.292
then the people from Wal-Mart

31:38.250 --> 31:40.250
didn't want anybody staying
in their parking lot anymore.

31:40.750 --> 31:42.250
Then I heard people saying

31:42.250 --> 31:44.125
that they were starting to stay
in a church parking lot.

31:44.125 --> 31:47.958
Some issues came up
her at the church,

31:47.958 --> 31:50.750
and then he told me
that, you know,

31:50.750 --> 31:52.250
I'd have to stay out
in the parking lot.

31:52.250 --> 31:54.250
He wanted me to
come meet his family

31:54.250 --> 31:56.667
and that I was
welcome to stay with them
as long as I wanted to.

31:56.667 --> 31:58.083
So what do you
want to do?

31:58.083 --> 32:00.083
Do you want to
come over now,
do you think?

32:00.083 --> 32:01.583
Yeah, let's go over now.

32:02.083 --> 32:03.542
I don't really know the pastor
personally that well.

32:03.542 --> 32:06.583
He really doesn't know me
that well, but...

32:06.583 --> 32:08.083
there's a bond there,

32:08.083 --> 32:09.542
and there's
a lot of trust there,

32:09.542 --> 32:13.042
and I guess maybe
it's on a different level.

32:13.042 --> 32:14.500
He told me that,
you know,

32:14.500 --> 32:17.000
he thinks that
our two lives came

32:17.500 --> 32:20.500
and we crossed this path
together for a reason.

32:20.500 --> 32:22.375
Hi, dear.
Keith is here.

32:22.417 --> 32:23.917
I'm thinking
it would be good--

32:23.917 --> 32:24.917
How about if we
brought him over here

32:24.917 --> 32:25.917
in about 10, 15 minutes?

32:26.417 --> 32:27.250
Would that be ok?

32:27.250 --> 32:30.042
I think now
would be better, ok?

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
Do you eat
tuna sandwiches?

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
Yeah.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.500
He eats tuna sandwiches.

32:33.542 --> 32:36.417
Oh, give thanks
unto the Lord

32:36.417 --> 32:37.792
for He is good.

32:37.792 --> 32:38.750
Amen.

32:39.292 --> 32:41.292
And thank you
for good company.

32:41.292 --> 32:42.708
All right.

32:47.583 --> 32:49.917
KEITH GRAVES: So, um,
how do you guys feel about

32:49.917 --> 32:52.792
people coming and staying
in your guys' home?

32:53.250 --> 32:54.708
When I met him,

32:54.708 --> 32:56.583
he had an 18-year-old
Native American guy

32:56.583 --> 32:58.083
living in his basement.

32:58.083 --> 33:00.083
I forgot about that.
Hmm.

33:00.083 --> 33:02.542
BOY:
I think it's a good thing.

33:02.542 --> 33:04.542
It's nice to meet people.

33:07.042 --> 33:09.917
I think it's good.
I like it. I enjoy it.

33:09.917 --> 33:13.792
Well, I appreciate
you guys giving me
the opportunity

33:13.792 --> 33:15.292
to stay with you guys.

33:15.292 --> 33:16.292
I really appreciate it.

33:16.292 --> 33:17.250
You bet.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.250
This is
the family room, ok?

33:22.250 --> 33:24.083
That's Eric's room.

33:24.083 --> 33:25.333
This is the laundry room.

33:25.333 --> 33:26.833
There's the bathroom.

33:26.833 --> 33:28.250
Anyway, so this is it.

33:28.250 --> 33:30.625
What made you
decide to...

33:30.625 --> 33:32.083
let me come
into your home

33:32.083 --> 33:35.417
and let me stay with
you and your family?

33:35.417 --> 33:37.708
The first thing
I had to do

33:37.708 --> 33:39.250
was, quite frankly,

33:39.250 --> 33:43.250
I was afraid the paper
was gonna come after the church.

33:43.250 --> 33:47.167
So I had to get you
out of the parking lot.

33:47.167 --> 33:51.083
I think you bear...
the burden

33:51.083 --> 33:55.083
of others' injustices,

33:55.583 --> 33:59.125
but you're not bitter
about it.

33:59.125 --> 34:00.958
And that impressed me.

34:00.958 --> 34:05.125
I just thought
this would work.

34:05.125 --> 34:06.458
Well, let's go in.
Ok?

34:06.458 --> 34:08.375
Ok.

34:08.375 --> 34:10.375
JAY, VOICE-OVER:
A sin or a crime,

34:10.375 --> 34:14.708
while it's real and it is
a part of one's record,

34:14.708 --> 34:18.042
I would submit ought not be
the definition of one's life.

34:19.542 --> 34:22.833
I'm not gonna put
my children at risk,

34:22.833 --> 34:25.333
and I do not believe
that I have.

34:39.125 --> 34:42.125
Just for now. Huh.

34:43.500 --> 34:46.375
We're not talking
about Keith.

34:46.375 --> 34:47.292
Uh-uh.

34:47.292 --> 34:48.875
I was gonna call
the elders.

34:49.375 --> 34:53.375
I decided not
to do that because...

34:53.875 --> 34:55.375
I don't think I need--
I shouldn't--

34:55.375 --> 34:56.875
No.

34:56.875 --> 34:58.375
I don't think
I should tell them yet.

34:58.375 --> 35:00.417
No, I think that should
just be kept at home...

35:00.375 --> 35:01.375
Well...
separate from the rest.

35:01.875 --> 35:03.375
the problem is
if the paper blows it up,

35:03.375 --> 35:05.375
that's gonna be
the problem.

35:05.375 --> 35:06.875
But then I guess
I'll have to deal with it.

35:07.417 --> 35:09.417
And then I'll explain
why I didn't say anything.

35:09.917 --> 35:11.917
But I don't think
I'd do him a favor

35:11.917 --> 35:13.417
if I tell
all the elders.

35:13.417 --> 35:15.833
I don't think
it's right to him.

35:15.833 --> 35:17.333
It's not, but you
honestly got to

35:17.917 --> 35:20.417
kind of look at
where your priorities
are, too.

35:20.417 --> 35:21.917
Well, that's it.
My first priority is to--

35:21.917 --> 35:25.167
my obligation as a pastor,
but I've got to be careful.

35:26.958 --> 35:28.458
JAY, VOICE-OVER: You really
have to struggle with,

35:28.458 --> 35:29.958
what are my motives here?

35:29.958 --> 35:31.458
I know, I'm...

35:32.958 --> 35:36.208
Maybe this is
just more self-serving

35:36.208 --> 35:38.208
than what I realize.

35:38.208 --> 35:41.208
Maybe it's as simple as
I don't say no very well,

35:41.583 --> 35:45.458
and so it's easier to say yes
and live with the consequences.

36:21.833 --> 36:25.333
ENGEL: Well, over
in my makeshift abode,

36:25.333 --> 36:27.833
I was staying at pastor's house.

36:27.833 --> 36:29.917
He begged me to stay with him,
which I didn't want to.

36:29.917 --> 36:32.917
And then after 4 days,
he threw me out.

36:33.417 --> 36:36.250
He was turning it into,
"I'm throwing you out

36:36.250 --> 36:38.500
because you don't listen to
my authority" kind of bullshit,

36:38.500 --> 36:41.000
but he told me the night before

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
that he wanted to move in
a sex offender,

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
and that's what
it was really about.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.500
So I confronted him on that.

36:45.500 --> 36:47.000
I said, "You know,
you're making it about me,

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
"throwing me out
for this bullshit reason,

36:49.000 --> 36:49.958
"but it's really
'cause you want to get

36:50.500 --> 36:52.000
"the sex offender in your house

36:52.000 --> 36:54.500
"'cause you're getting heat
from the church where you are,

36:54.500 --> 36:55.958
"and you're getting heat
from the media,

36:55.958 --> 36:57.958
and you have to move in here,"
and he admitted that.

37:00.458 --> 37:03.750
The hypocrisy of the situation
gets me a little upset,

37:03.750 --> 37:05.000
that someone's gonna tell me
they love me

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
and then throw my bags
out in the street.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.500
I don't know, is that being
true to yourself?

37:09.500 --> 37:11.875
He told me that he didn't like
my character.

37:11.833 --> 37:13.625
I mean, one thing about me,
I may be miserable,

37:13.625 --> 37:15.833
but I'm not living a lie,
you know what I mean?

37:17.875 --> 37:19.708
I'm not completely
selfish or self-centered
like Keith, though,

37:19.708 --> 37:22.042
but I am pretty vindictive.

37:25.042 --> 37:27.000
I told him that,

37:27.000 --> 37:28.458
"How would you like me
to go knock on every door
in your town,"

37:28.458 --> 37:30.000
which I haven't done,
"and tell 'em you have

37:30.000 --> 37:31.500
a registered sex offender
in your house?"

37:31.500 --> 37:33.500
And I said, "How would you
like me to go to the media?"

37:33.500 --> 37:36.000
I'll give him a scripture verse.

37:36.500 --> 37:38.792
You sew the wind,
you reap the whirlwind.

37:38.792 --> 37:40.583
Add you're gonna reap
the whirlwind.

[Piano playing]

37:49.125 --> 37:50.625
JAY:
I'm kind of a one-trick pony

37:50.625 --> 37:52.458
when it comes into
reading scripture,

37:52.500 --> 37:55.833
but there's certain passages
that I just kind of go to.

37:55.792 --> 37:59.583
This is from "John," chapter 10.

37:59.583 --> 38:00.917
"I am the good shepherd.

38:01.458 --> 38:03.958
"The good shepherd lays down
his life for the sheep.

38:03.958 --> 38:07.333
"I am a good shepherd,

and I know the Father,

38:09.667 --> 38:13.583

for the sheep.

38:13.583 --> 38:16.792

I know them and they follow me.

"I give eternal life to them
and they shall never perish,

38:20.458 --> 38:22.875
and no one shall snatch them
out of my hand."

38:32.042 --> 38:33.958
That's how we do it.

38:33.958 --> 38:37.625
They're starting
at $15 an hour here,

38:37.625 --> 38:39.458
and then they said after
I've been here about 3 months,

38:39.458 --> 38:40.792
they'll give me a raise.

38:40.792 --> 38:44.208
I went through being
really depressed, you know,

38:44.208 --> 38:47.167
'cause I'd been here for about
a month and didn't have a job.

38:47.667 --> 38:49.500

38:52.250 --> 38:54.625
Mama's happy, too,
my wife's happy, too.

38:54.625 --> 38:57.875
She was, like, sending me
pictures of the clothes
she had bought, you know,

38:57.875 --> 38:59.625
and stuff she bought
for the baby that's coming.

39:00.125 --> 39:02.625
She put a baby bed on layaway,
you know,

39:02.625 --> 39:04.125
I could tell she was happy,

39:04.125 --> 39:05.625
and that makes you feel good,
you know,

39:05.625 --> 39:09.042
that she's getting the things
she wants.

39:09.042 --> 39:11.542
Hell, this is what I love, too.

39:11.542 --> 39:12.917
That's what makes it so good.

39:12.917 --> 39:14.333
I'm doing what I love to do.

39:14.292 --> 39:15.792
I would have done anything,

39:15.792 --> 39:18.625
but I'm getting to do
what I love.

but it's home.

they were looking for, I guess,

have sex with her,"

I personally feel,
a little out of hand.

it's helpful--

that's not official,

it's ministry,

I'm gonna have
to find--

58:31.292 --> 58:32.792
You know,
just a second.
Hold on.

58:32.792 --> 58:34.083
I want you
to stay here.

58:34.083 --> 58:36.833
I think let's
do this together.

58:36.833 --> 58:38.750
That would be
my hope.

58:38.750 --> 58:40.750
What does your wife
think about all this?

58:40.750 --> 58:44.167
What do you feel
is the best situation

58:44.167 --> 58:47.917
for your family,
the church, your husband?

58:47.917 --> 58:50.667
The concerns
I did have

58:51.208 --> 58:54.708
was the neighbors
and the church

58:55.208 --> 58:59.708
because people
who don't know
your story...

58:59.708 --> 59:03.208
uh, can't empathize.

59:03.208 --> 59:04.708
JAY:
And most people,

59:04.708 --> 59:06.458
when they hear
"registered sex offender,"

59:06.458 --> 59:08.958
they think of some--
a molester and a rapist.

59:08.958 --> 59:09.958
I mean,
they just go on and on.

59:09.958 --> 59:12.458
And they don't realize,
you know,

59:12.458 --> 59:15.500
and 18-year-old guy sleeping
with a 16-year-old girl,

59:16.000 --> 59:19.125
his girlfriend, and that's
a different kind of a...

59:19.125 --> 59:20.625
but they understand
there's differences.

59:20.625 --> 59:22.625
I'm concerned about

59:22.625 --> 59:27.708
the members
of our church, um...

59:27.708 --> 59:29.708
ah...

59:29.708 --> 59:34.208
calling into question
my husband's...

59:34.708 --> 59:36.708
dealings
with the guys.

59:36.708 --> 59:37.708
JAY: Judgment.

59:38.208 --> 59:39.208
Judgment.

59:39.208 --> 59:40.208
What's the whole--

59:40.208 --> 59:41.667
Let me ask you
this question.

59:41.667 --> 59:43.208
What's the whole purpose
of the church

59:43.208 --> 59:44.708
and what's the whole
church doctrine?

59:44.708 --> 59:46.708
Save sinners,
forgiveness of sins,

59:46.708 --> 59:47.708
life and salvation.

59:48.208 --> 59:49.208
That's the bottom line.

59:49.208 --> 59:50.208
...Christ.

59:50.208 --> 59:51.208
And then love people.

59:51.208 --> 59:52.667
...died for
their sins.

59:52.667 --> 59:53.667
The things that
you guys are saying

59:53.667 --> 59:55.000
that may be a problem
for the church

59:55.000 --> 59:55.833
or that the church
is concerned about

59:55.833 --> 59:57.333
is something
that the church

59:57.333 --> 59:58.833
is probably supposed
to be doing anyway.

59:58.833 --> 01:00:00.750
The problem is

01:00:00.708 --> 01:00:02.083
we're working
with sinners,

01:00:02.083 --> 01:00:03.583
and some people
are fearful.

01:00:08.083 --> 01:00:09.917
JAY: Well, ok,
here's what I'm asking.

01:00:09.917 --> 01:00:13.000
Why don't we, just before
we take any action,

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
let's talk face to face.

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.500
At one point
at the previous meeting,

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:19.000
you were not upset
about this.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.458
You suggested we get showers
for the men.

01:00:21.458 --> 01:00:25.917
Um, this isn't...

01:00:25.917 --> 01:00:28.917
Anyway, um...

01:00:33.542 --> 01:00:35.625
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:39.833 --> 01:00:43.250
We add new people.

01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:45.833
But it's hard to take off

01:00:45.833 --> 01:00:48.333
the people that
aren't there anymore.

01:00:52.208 --> 01:00:54.708
They left.

01:00:56.708 --> 01:00:59.208
They left.

01:01:04.708 --> 01:01:06.708
They left.

01:01:11.958 --> 01:01:15.125
Well, thanks
for your invitation

01:01:15.125 --> 01:01:17.125
for me to come
and talk with you.

01:01:17.125 --> 01:01:22.042
My presence here tonight
is to just to kind of

01:01:22.042 --> 01:01:23.750
hear what you
might have to say to me

01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:24.792
about what's going on
in your community

01:01:24.792 --> 01:01:26.792
and in your congregation

01:01:26.792 --> 01:01:29.833
and to help me think
if there are ways

01:01:29.792 --> 01:01:32.292
that we as the district
might plug in

01:01:32.292 --> 01:01:34.292
to help you in some way
or another.

01:01:34.583 --> 01:01:35.833
WOMAN: I think the biggest
problem we have right now

01:01:36.333 --> 01:01:38.250
is we've lost many people
from this congregation.

01:01:38.250 --> 01:01:39.250
Uh-huh.

01:01:39.583 --> 01:01:40.917
And I miss them.

01:01:40.917 --> 01:01:42.833
I think when relationships
are put under stress

01:01:42.875 --> 01:01:46.792
by those kinds of pressures,
lots of things happen.

01:01:46.792 --> 01:01:48.708
Does that create
a certain amount of resentment?

01:01:48.708 --> 01:01:49.708
Yes.

01:01:49.708 --> 01:01:50.708
Yeah.

01:01:51.083 --> 01:01:53.667
Do you think the people
of this congregation

01:01:53.667 --> 01:01:56.500
feel like
they are being invaded?

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.333
MAN: Mm-hmm.
I'd say yes.

01:01:58.333 --> 01:02:01.000
There for a while
I didn't feel safe

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.792
coming into
the building.

01:02:02.792 --> 01:02:05.042
Is there any sense
of optimism?

01:02:05.042 --> 01:02:06.458
Is it going to get better?

01:02:06.458 --> 01:02:07.792
Or are you still in a--
Oh, ooh.

01:02:07.792 --> 01:02:09.792
I see heads going already.

01:02:09.792 --> 01:02:11.250
It's not getting better.

01:02:11.250 --> 01:02:14.208
MAN:
It's kind of a twist
in the church right now.

01:02:14.208 --> 01:02:16.500
You can make
all the positive
things you want

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:18.458
about helping people
and doing that,

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:22.750
but when we're losing
your people coming
to church,

01:02:22.750 --> 01:02:24.042
are we gonna have
enough people left here

01:02:24.042 --> 01:02:25.792
to take care of
this place?

01:02:25.792 --> 01:02:27.125
The meeting
that we approved

01:02:27.125 --> 01:02:30.417
that we would carry
the overnighters,

01:02:30.417 --> 01:02:32.250
we had 7 new members--

01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:34.167
MAN:
Yeah, I know--

01:02:34.167 --> 01:02:36.458
There was a large manipulation
that went on,

01:02:36.458 --> 01:02:38.333
very large manipulation,

01:02:38.333 --> 01:02:41.833
and I haven't seen
any of those people since then.

01:02:41.833 --> 01:02:44.333
Maybe we're just being used.

01:02:44.333 --> 01:02:47.542
TERRY FORKE:
Please pray for strength
to love each other

01:02:47.542 --> 01:02:49.625
because you are under
extreme pressure,

01:02:49.625 --> 01:02:52.125
and if you depend
on your own abilities,

01:02:52.125 --> 01:02:54.917
you're gonna nose-dive.

01:02:54.917 --> 01:02:55.750
You need to
love each other

01:02:56.250 --> 01:02:58.167
and be able to speak
to each other.

01:02:58.167 --> 01:03:01.042
Our father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name,

01:03:01.083 --> 01:03:04.500
thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:05.958
on Earth as it is in heaven.

01:03:06.417 --> 01:03:09.958
Give us this day our daily bread
and lead us not into temptation

01:03:10.458 --> 01:03:11.375
but deliver us from evil

01:03:11.375 --> 01:03:14.750
for Thine is the kingdom
for ever and ever.

01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:16.125
Amen.

01:03:25.125 --> 01:03:28.000
JAY: Hi.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:28.875
How are you
doing today?

01:03:28.875 --> 01:03:29.875
I'm ok.

01:03:29.875 --> 01:03:31.375
Simon Jones
is my name.

01:03:31.375 --> 01:03:32.375
Ok.
I'm from
Mississippi,

01:03:32.375 --> 01:03:33.875
and I
come up here

01:03:33.875 --> 01:03:34.750
to see about
some work.

01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:36.083
Check out job service.

01:03:36.083 --> 01:03:37.083
I plan to do that
in the morning.

01:03:37.083 --> 01:03:39.083
If I can't get
in the oil field,

01:03:39.125 --> 01:03:41.625
then I'll just
head back East.

01:03:42.125 --> 01:03:45.125
Well, um, I'm not
trying to write you
out of the oil field,

01:03:45.125 --> 01:03:49.125
but I will tell you,
age is not gonna be
in your favor.

01:03:49.125 --> 01:03:52.167
Older guys
don't get hired
nearly as quickly.

01:03:52.167 --> 01:03:56.542
Let me give you
the name of a place
in Watford City.

01:03:56.542 --> 01:03:57.833
They're looking
for roustabouts.

01:03:58.333 --> 01:04:00.333
At the very least
it will be worth
a call.

01:04:00.333 --> 01:04:01.333
Hmm.

01:04:01.333 --> 01:04:03.333
Thank you.

01:04:03.333 --> 01:04:04.333
I'm sorry I can't
give you more.

01:04:04.333 --> 01:04:06.167
That's enough.

01:04:21.250 --> 01:04:23.042
You know, it's just
all the phone calls

01:04:23.083 --> 01:04:27.083
and the interruptions
and guys who want help

01:04:27.083 --> 01:04:29.083
and just calling all day.

01:04:29.583 --> 01:04:32.500
So...

01:04:32.542 --> 01:04:35.458
Some days I think
if it were over with,

01:04:35.458 --> 01:04:38.458
it would be better,

01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:42.958
but I also realize
that, um...

01:04:45.875 --> 01:04:48.958
the people are gonna
still keep coming.

01:04:48.958 --> 01:04:50.958
They're not gonna stop.

01:04:51.458 --> 01:04:55.458
And as long as
there's people coming,

01:04:55.458 --> 01:05:00.000
they're gonna be asking
for help.

01:04:59.958 --> 01:05:02.875
And it's hard to say no.

01:05:13.292 --> 01:05:19.333
This is one of the hardest
things we've ever had to do...

01:05:19.333 --> 01:05:22.333
and I'll be glad when it's done.

01:05:51.083 --> 01:05:54.750
Oh, man. Oh, man.

01:05:59.708 --> 01:06:02.083
Oh, my word.

01:06:08.208 --> 01:06:11.583
JAY, VOICE-OVER:
It's damage control.

01:06:11.583 --> 01:06:13.000
Keith is on this list,

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:19.625
And by putting our church here
as the address...

01:06:19.625 --> 01:06:23.042
I can tell you every neighbor
is nervous tonight.

01:06:28.375 --> 01:06:30.875
Most merciful God
we ask your blessing

01:06:30.875 --> 01:06:34.292
upon the men whose names
appear on the sex offender list.

01:06:34.292 --> 01:06:37.667
Some of those crimes are brutal.

01:06:37.667 --> 01:06:40.542
We ask, O Lord, that you would
help them to know

01:06:40.542 --> 01:06:43.125
that they are not just
what that label says they are.

01:06:43.125 --> 01:06:44.500
When we discovered them,

01:06:44.708 --> 01:06:46.542
they had that...

01:06:46.542 --> 01:06:47.917
Obviously that raises
a concern.

01:06:47.917 --> 01:06:49.417
Pray for the children
that have suffered

01:06:49.417 --> 01:06:52.000
and been abused.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.833
Pray for the women who
were not treated with respect.

01:06:56.833 --> 01:07:02.500
Please let your word
comfort and guide them.

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:03.875
WOMAN: No. No, no.

01:07:03.875 --> 01:07:05.375
Ok, well, ok.
It's ok.

01:07:05.417 --> 01:07:07.417
Ok, but just,
you know, ma'am--

01:07:07.417 --> 01:07:09.417
That's fine,
but I don't want any part

01:07:09.417 --> 01:07:12.833
of any more of
all the rigmarole. No.

01:07:12.833 --> 01:07:14.667
[Door closes]

01:07:22.875 --> 01:07:26.375
JAY: I'm kind of sympathetic
with somebody

01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:30.875
who just can't defend
themselves.

01:07:34.375 --> 01:07:37.875
They're carrying burdens.

01:07:37.875 --> 01:07:40.333
Everybody is bearing a burden.

01:07:43.375 --> 01:07:45.708
[Train whistle blows]

01:07:57.958 --> 01:08:00.458
It's just me, it's not my
girlfriend or my kid anymore,

01:08:00.458 --> 01:08:02.458
so...

01:08:02.458 --> 01:08:04.458
She really wasn't liking it
out here.

01:08:04.458 --> 01:08:05.917
I mean...

01:08:05.917 --> 01:08:07.875
I wouldn't like the situation
she was in either.

01:08:07.875 --> 01:08:10.792
She was cooped up all day
in a camper

01:08:10.792 --> 01:08:12.250
watching my son.

01:08:12.250 --> 01:08:14.667
I definitely understand
why it was hard on her.

01:08:14.667 --> 01:08:17.082
That's just
the little things
that come, man.

01:08:17.082 --> 01:08:19.375
She's been
out here twice.

01:08:19.375 --> 01:08:20.375
Twice?
Yeah.

01:08:20.375 --> 01:08:21.375
She try looking
for work?

01:08:21.375 --> 01:08:22.667
Nah, she, uh,

01:08:22.667 --> 01:08:24.457
she's wanting to
get a job back home,

01:08:24.457 --> 01:08:26.457
but it's a lot easier
to get a job back home

01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:28.500
'cause she had my mom
to watch my son

01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:29.500
and her mom.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.750
I mean, they all
watch him for nothing,

01:08:31.750 --> 01:08:33.582
like they don't ask
no money or like that.

01:08:33.582 --> 01:08:35.082
She needs to be here, man.

01:08:35.082 --> 01:08:37.082
Waitresses are getting paid
16 bucks an hour plus tips.

01:08:37.582 --> 01:08:38.957
You know what I mean?

01:08:38.957 --> 01:08:40.750
This is the best place
to be, man.

01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:42.250
Oh, yeah.

01:08:42.292 --> 01:08:45.250
Really. Well, I mean,
you got to have

01:08:45.625 --> 01:08:46.957
certain tools to survive,

01:08:47.417 --> 01:08:49.457
especially right now
through the winter, bro.

01:08:49.457 --> 01:08:52.917
Well, I ain't ditching
this place.

01:08:52.917 --> 01:08:56.707
What else is there,
man, really?

01:08:56.707 --> 01:08:58.500
I think he just needs
to go see his girl,

01:08:58.500 --> 01:08:59.792
and then he'll
be all right.

01:08:59.792 --> 01:09:01.082
'Cause it's rough out here
with no--

01:09:01.082 --> 01:09:03.042
when you don't have
a female companion

01:09:03.042 --> 01:09:07.125
to help you keep
your level ground, you know?

01:09:07.082 --> 01:09:11.250
When all you see is
males, males, males, males

01:09:11.250 --> 01:09:12.792
hungry for money.

01:09:12.792 --> 01:09:14.292
Mm-hmm.

01:09:14.292 --> 01:09:15.667
Yeah, he'll be back.

01:09:15.625 --> 01:09:17.457
I'm hoping that
I can spend

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:19.000
enough time
with my family

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.500
and just kind
of see 'em all
and whatnot

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.375
and come back
with a vengeance.

01:09:22.375 --> 01:09:25.250
You know what
you got to do.

01:09:36.207 --> 01:09:39.082
BATTEN, VOICE-OVER:
My wife hasn't talked
to me in about a week.

01:09:39.082 --> 01:09:41.167
She said I've abandoned her.

01:09:41.167 --> 01:09:42.667
I don't know
what's going on.

01:09:42.667 --> 01:09:44.667
She don't answer my calls.

01:09:44.667 --> 01:09:48.042
She's the type of person,
she can't be alone.

01:09:48.042 --> 01:09:51.707
And I've left her alone.

01:09:51.667 --> 01:09:53.500
You know what they say,

01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:56.500
if you don't give them
attention, somebody else will.

01:10:00.083 --> 01:10:03.083
I came out here
with a lot of hope.

01:10:03.125 --> 01:10:05.625
I mean a lot of hope.

01:10:05.625 --> 01:10:08.083
Kind of felt like
it was going good

01:10:08.083 --> 01:10:10.542
just until this last week.

01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:15.458
I mean, if I go home,
I might have a chance

01:10:15.458 --> 01:10:16.958
to get my family back.

01:10:16.958 --> 01:10:18.958
If I don't, I got no chance.

01:10:18.958 --> 01:10:22.000
No matter how much money
I make out here.

01:10:22.583 --> 01:10:26.875
And then when I go home,
what's gonna be there?

01:10:26.875 --> 01:10:29.917
Same ol' nothin'.

01:10:29.917 --> 01:10:32.333
At least out here
I can hold my head up

01:10:32.333 --> 01:10:34.292
and know I'm working
and trying.

01:10:34.292 --> 01:10:38.250
At home, just another bum.

01:10:42.125 --> 01:10:45.417
Coming home, baby.

01:10:45.417 --> 01:10:47.667
Daddy's coming home.

01:10:53.542 --> 01:10:56.542
I wonder how many guys like me
has come out here

01:10:56.542 --> 01:10:57.542
and they're in the same boat.

01:10:58.042 --> 01:10:59.500
They're losing their families.

01:11:04.125 --> 01:11:07.542
It's ironic that I came out here
to save my family,

01:11:07.542 --> 01:11:10.042
and it's probably gonna cost me
my family.

01:11:28.167 --> 01:11:30.625
JAY: I would still ask you
to consider

01:11:30.958 --> 01:11:33.542
that rather than printing
all the name,

01:11:33.542 --> 01:11:37.625
these are the reasons why
a list we print

01:11:37.625 --> 01:11:40.375
would be maybe less helpful
than we'd like it to be.

01:11:40.375 --> 01:11:42.750
We can't distinguish
between the levels.
Right.

01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:45.250
It just creates a strong
emotional reaction.

01:11:45.250 --> 01:11:47.250
Boom, here's
a sex offender list.

01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:51.625
So a just quick transfer
of hostility and emotion.

01:11:51.625 --> 01:11:53.000
See, I don't think
it's fair

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.000
to write every name,

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.542
but you know, our choice

01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:56.500
was either
we run nothing

01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:58.000
or we run 'em all.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.958
And what we decided is

01:11:59.958 --> 01:12:03.708
the public's right
to know outweighed

01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:05.083
the risk that people
that aren't dangerous

01:12:05.542 --> 01:12:07.542
might get harmed by it.

01:12:07.542 --> 01:12:10.458
Because, you know,
I have 4 little kids.

01:12:10.458 --> 01:12:12.333
My right to know
if my kids are in danger

01:12:12.333 --> 01:12:13.792
in my own neighborhood

01:12:13.792 --> 01:12:18.792
to me is more important
than anything else.

01:12:18.792 --> 01:12:20.750
So you can't drive
a truck because

01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:23.208
that would
put you in contact
with the public.

01:12:23.208 --> 01:12:24.667
Certain people...

01:12:25.167 --> 01:12:26.667
[Indistinct]

01:12:33.125 --> 01:12:36.125
JAY: I'm glad to have
Keith in my home,

01:12:36.125 --> 01:12:37.625
I really am.

01:12:38.083 --> 01:12:43.167
And I trust him
and I realize you're
in a difficult spot.

01:12:43.667 --> 01:12:45.667
When we ran his
background check,

01:12:45.667 --> 01:12:48.083
you know,
routinely we only
go back 7 years,

01:12:48.083 --> 01:12:50.667
so we obviously
didn't catch this thing.

01:12:50.667 --> 01:12:52.667
Otherwise he probably
never would have
been hired.

01:12:53.167 --> 01:12:55.667
Why would we
bother with the hassle?

01:12:55.667 --> 01:13:00.167
I have to justify
to the other 47
employees

01:13:00.167 --> 01:13:02.667
that I have here
that we're doing
everything that we can.

01:13:02.667 --> 01:13:04.667
We're not putting
anybody in harm's way.

01:13:16.458 --> 01:13:21.000
I want to be
your advocate, ok?

01:13:20.958 --> 01:13:24.458
But your pattern
of withholding
information

01:13:24.458 --> 01:13:27.458
does not serve you
and it does not serve
others well.

01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:29.000
You think you're
protecting yourself,

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.500
and what it does is...
is it heightens
the risk.

01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:36.500
Now, it is true.

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:42.500
I think had you put
on your application
your conviction,

01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:44.500
you might not
have gotten hired.

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:47.458
I think that's true.
That's a risk
you have to take.

01:13:47.458 --> 01:13:52.250
And I think you think
you're protected

01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:55.083
when you say less,

01:13:55.083 --> 01:13:56.583
and I think that puts
you at greater risk

01:13:56.583 --> 01:14:00.583
and it puts other people
at risk.

01:14:00.583 --> 01:14:04.083
You need to share more,
not less.

01:14:04.583 --> 01:14:07.917
Yeah, I'm thinking about
how you think certain
things should go.

01:14:07.917 --> 01:14:09.417
No. What I'm saying is

01:14:09.917 --> 01:14:12.417
you don't approach
people honestly,

01:14:12.417 --> 01:14:14.917
and you can dismiss that
as my opinion,

01:14:14.917 --> 01:14:16.917
or you can say,
"You know what?

01:14:16.917 --> 01:14:18.917
Maybe I'm not being
honest with people."

01:14:18.917 --> 01:14:20.417
Maybe not.

01:14:20.917 --> 01:14:23.417
Well, then rather than
just dismissing that
as an opinion,

01:14:23.417 --> 01:14:27.917
consider it as maybe
valuable information.

01:14:27.917 --> 01:14:29.292
You ain't the one
that's gonna deal with
the consequences from it.

01:14:29.292 --> 01:14:30.792
You know what?

01:14:31.292 --> 01:14:32.250
You know who's
going to have
more consequences here?

01:14:32.250 --> 01:14:33.292
I am, not you.

01:14:33.792 --> 01:14:34.792
How do you figure that?

01:14:34.792 --> 01:14:36.292
Because I'm the one
in the community,

01:14:36.292 --> 01:14:37.792
I'm the one
in the neighborhood,

01:14:37.792 --> 01:14:39.792
I'm the one who's
taking the risk here.

01:14:39.792 --> 01:14:41.792
And you're talking about
your risks, ok?

01:14:41.792 --> 01:14:43.792
Yeah, 'cause
I might be the one
sitting in jail, not you.

01:14:43.792 --> 01:14:45.208
You're not gonna be
in jail.

01:14:45.208 --> 01:14:46.583
You don't know that.

01:14:46.625 --> 01:14:47.917
You can't say that this,

01:14:47.875 --> 01:14:49.875
your next door neighbor,
may tell her daughter,

01:14:49.875 --> 01:14:52.375
"Hey, you know what?
Did the guy look at you?"

01:14:52.375 --> 01:14:56.167
And you're telling me
that you know that
she wouldn't do that.

01:14:56.167 --> 01:14:59.042
You don't know that,
do you?

01:14:59.042 --> 01:15:00.542
And if that did happen,

01:15:00.542 --> 01:15:03.542
you go to them,
you just say, "I'm sorry."

01:15:03.542 --> 01:15:05.375
But I'm the one
that in this situation

01:15:05.875 --> 01:15:08.667
having to explain
how this happened.

01:15:08.667 --> 01:15:10.958
And I don't want to be
in that position.

01:15:10.958 --> 01:15:13.417
I am really tired...

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
of your withholding
information,

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.500
and I'm responsible
to withhold it
with you.

01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:19.500
You are binding
my conscience,

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.500
and sometimes that
doesn't serve people,

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:23.500
and it doesn't serve
my family.

01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:25.500
And I'm going
to tell you
real quickly

01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:27.000
two things
that you could do

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
that would
really help me.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.500
One, give me permission
to share it.

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:33.542
It is public
information, Keith.

01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:34.500
It's public.

01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:36.000
You do what
you want to.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.500
No, no, no. That's
not what I'm asking.

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:38.500
That's not
what I'm asking.

01:15:39.042 --> 01:15:40.542
Why you getting
all animated?

01:15:40.542 --> 01:15:41.542
Because I'm frustrated.

01:15:41.542 --> 01:15:42.417
Why you making a scene?

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000
This right here,
your attitude,

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.333
the way you're
displaying your behavior,

01:15:46.333 --> 01:15:47.667
is unnecessary.

01:15:47.667 --> 01:15:50.167
You don't have
to become hostile.

01:15:50.167 --> 01:15:53.667
Ok. How about emotional
and a little angry?

01:15:53.667 --> 01:15:55.667
Well, maybe you
need time to cool off
and think about it.

01:15:55.667 --> 01:15:57.667
Maybe--
Just a second.

01:15:58.167 --> 01:15:59.708
I'm finished talking.

01:16:20.917 --> 01:16:24.917
MEZO: Got pulled
over for driving
with no license.

01:16:25.417 --> 01:16:26.917
And as he ran my name
and everything,

01:16:27.417 --> 01:16:29.917
found out I was
a registered
sex offender

01:16:29.917 --> 01:16:32.792
from something
back in '86.

01:16:32.792 --> 01:16:37.083
I'm not like
a sexual predator
or anything like that,

01:16:37.083 --> 01:16:38.875
you know.

01:16:38.875 --> 01:16:40.167
To be honest with you,

01:16:40.167 --> 01:16:42.667
I don't regret
not registering
right away.

01:16:42.667 --> 01:16:45.667
If I'd have done that,
I wouldn't have
been here.

01:16:45.667 --> 01:16:48.167
I wouldn't know
any of you.

01:16:49.667 --> 01:16:53.708
You know, you guys
would have had to
turn me away.

01:16:53.667 --> 01:16:56.583
When I was here
helping you

01:16:56.583 --> 01:17:00.583
with keys in my pocket,
access in and out,

01:17:00.625 --> 01:17:03.917
you leaving,
I'm in charge of the
overnighter thing.

01:17:03.917 --> 01:17:06.792
My growth is real.
It's not an act.

01:17:06.792 --> 01:17:09.708
It's not something
I'm putting on,
you know.

01:17:09.708 --> 01:17:12.625
I've been
a pretty good con artist
most of my life.

01:17:12.625 --> 01:17:16.417
And this ain't a con.

01:17:16.417 --> 01:17:20.625
Alan, you need to move.

01:17:23.375 --> 01:17:25.208
You're attracting
lightning here.

01:17:38.667 --> 01:17:40.167
MEZO, VOICE-OVER:
It doesn't matter

01:17:40.167 --> 01:17:41.667
what good a person does.

01:17:41.667 --> 01:17:43.667
Even if they're a hero today,

01:17:43.667 --> 01:17:47.167
5 years down the road,
that's buried somewhere.

01:17:47.167 --> 01:17:49.042
That's no ton their record,

01:17:49.042 --> 01:17:51.625
and all it is on their record

01:17:51.625 --> 01:17:52.708
that stays with them
throughout their life

01:17:53.208 --> 01:17:54.708
is negative stuff,

01:17:54.708 --> 01:17:58.417
and it's sad because
that's such a judgment.

01:18:38.125 --> 01:18:41.875
EDWARDS: It wasn't till late
that I got everything packed up

01:18:41.875 --> 01:18:44.125
and was probably
about 10:30, 11:00

01:18:44.125 --> 01:18:47.958
when I finally left Williston.

01:18:49.458 --> 01:18:56.208
Fell asleep and woke up
in my truck

01:18:56.208 --> 01:18:59.458
about ready to roll over,

01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:03.000
and then woke up again
in the ambulance, so...

01:19:05.917 --> 01:19:09.000
The only, like,
clear memory I have

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
is sitting in a hospital,

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.167
just waiting on my parents
to get there.

01:19:17.667 --> 01:19:21.708
I fractured the C7 vertebra.

01:19:29.125 --> 01:19:31.000
MAN: I said, "What are
you gonna do out there?"

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.917
And he didn't have no idea
what he was gonna do.

01:19:34.417 --> 01:19:36.667
He was bound and determined
he was gonna do it.

01:19:36.667 --> 01:19:42.125
Just kind of gets his mind
set on something and does it.

01:19:42.583 --> 01:19:43.583
Kind of like everything
he does.

01:19:43.583 --> 01:19:46.083
Mom.

01:19:46.125 --> 01:19:48.125
He just gets it in his head
he's gonna do something,

01:19:48.625 --> 01:19:49.875
and he does it.

01:19:49.875 --> 01:19:54.042
As far as him
going back out there,

01:19:54.042 --> 01:19:56.917
honestly I--I--
I've told all my
kids this.

01:19:56.917 --> 01:19:58.917
I said, "When you
leave high school,

01:19:58.917 --> 01:19:59.917
don't come back."

01:19:59.917 --> 01:20:00.917
I mean,
I'll come visit you.

01:20:01.417 --> 01:20:02.417
I can go
wherever you live.

01:20:02.917 --> 01:20:03.792
There's nothing here.

01:20:03.792 --> 01:20:05.167
It's a shame
to say that.

01:20:05.167 --> 01:20:09.000
It's a community
to raise your kids
and tell 'em,

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.458
"Go do something.
You're not gonna
do it here

01:20:11.458 --> 01:20:14.792
because
there's nothing here."

01:20:14.792 --> 01:20:16.208
Which just pisses me off

01:20:16.208 --> 01:20:17.208
'cause you go up
to North Dakota

01:20:17.208 --> 01:20:19.708
and it's
a shitty-ass place,

01:20:19.708 --> 01:20:22.708
and I mean, yeah,
there's a lot of money,

01:20:23.250 --> 01:20:24.250
but I'd love that
more than anything

01:20:24.250 --> 01:20:25.750
to be able to work
in Wisconsin

01:20:26.250 --> 01:20:28.250
and make the kind of money
I was making out there.

01:20:33.250 --> 01:20:34.583
Go ahead.

01:20:34.583 --> 01:20:36.875

and the connections are real
and they're intense,

and then they're gone.

01:20:47.042 --> 01:20:49.000
That's painful.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:56.208
And in a sense,
this is broken in maybe...

01:20:56.250 --> 01:20:59.750

they weren't broken before.

when everything kind of blew up
in my face.

You're on

about waving at Amtrak.

Do you mind?

01:24:10.042 --> 01:24:11.542
Just a sec.
I always feel like

01:24:11.542 --> 01:24:13.542
we should wave at an Amtrak
when it goes by.

You're egotistic.

That's how I feel.

you know?

01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:07.208
I've got no more respect
for you at all. None.

JAY: I don't understand
how a community

can just simply turn its back

on people who have
no place to sleep.

I would...

01:27:12.958 --> 01:27:16.958
just wonder...

01:27:16.958 --> 01:27:19.458
are we even a community?

01:27:21.292 --> 01:27:24.292

What does that mean?

01:27:24.292 --> 01:27:25.750
Does that mean you
have to close down
in 30 days?

01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:27.292
Does that--
Are we--

01:27:27.292 --> 01:27:30.292
Actually understand
what's gonna happen?

01:27:30.292 --> 01:27:32.292
Definitely it means
her letter says

01:27:32.292 --> 01:27:34.583
we have to close
in 30 days.

01:27:34.583 --> 01:27:40.875
If--If we are not heard
at the planning and zoning,

01:27:40.875 --> 01:27:48.375
then I think
the only options
will be to close...

01:27:50.875 --> 01:27:52.875
to engage
in civil disobedience

01:27:53.333 --> 01:27:55.875
and simply ignore them.

01:27:56.167 --> 01:27:57.417
Well, kicking people
out of a church

01:27:57.417 --> 01:27:58.917
isn't gonna change
the fact

01:27:58.917 --> 01:28:00.417
that there's still
an oil boom going on.

01:28:00.417 --> 01:28:03.250
It's not gonna stop
the people from coming.

01:28:03.250 --> 01:28:05.167
You know?

01:28:05.167 --> 01:28:07.000

the assumption that,

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.500
well, if everything
were to just stop
tomorrow,

01:28:09.542 --> 01:28:11.542
life would go back
to the way it was.

01:28:12.042 --> 01:28:13.542

I don't know
what to say.

01:28:17.875 --> 01:28:22.667
I mean, it could
possibly go
in our favor.

01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:30.375
Under communications,

01:28:30.375 --> 01:28:32.667

in the audience

01:28:32.667 --> 01:28:34.917
are here this evening
for this,

01:28:34.917 --> 01:28:38.708
but we had a special
permitted use application

01:28:38.708 --> 01:28:43.042
for Concordia Lutheran Church
to house people,

01:28:43.042 --> 01:28:47.542
and after a special meeting,
a decision was made

01:28:47.542 --> 01:28:50.042
to withdraw that application

01:28:50.083 --> 01:28:52.583
or take that off the agenda
for this evening,

01:28:52.583 --> 01:28:55.250
and I would ask Kent
to please expound

01:28:55.250 --> 01:28:57.750
on what transpired there.

01:28:57.750 --> 01:29:00.625
KENT: The fire chief
looked through

01:29:00.625 --> 01:29:01.458
his ordinance and codes,

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.500
and based on the way
the setup is now,

01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:06.583
the building does not have
a sprinkler system.

01:29:06.583 --> 01:29:09.125
You can't have sleeping
facilities in the hallways.

01:29:09.125 --> 01:29:15.417
You have to deem
specific sleeping areas
and meet fire codes.

01:29:15.417 --> 01:29:18.292
So therefore
it was deemed incomplete.

01:29:18.292 --> 01:29:19.750
MAN: Ok.

01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:22.250
So if there's other things
that you want to stay for,

01:29:22.250 --> 01:29:24.167
you're certainly welcome
to stay,

01:29:24.167 --> 01:29:25.500
but if that's the specific
reason that you're here,

01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:28.583
we cannot act on it, ok?

01:29:28.583 --> 01:29:32.083
Mr. Chairman,
will you take
any public...

01:29:32.083 --> 01:29:34.583
No. At this time,
I really can't

01:29:34.583 --> 01:29:36.583
because we aren't going
to be acting on it.

01:29:36.583 --> 01:29:40.083
So therefore we won't be taking
any public comments
at this time.

01:29:40.083 --> 01:29:45.458
Ok, we will move on to our
public hearings this evening.

01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:54.292

any way around our closing

by the 12th of September.

01:29:56.208 --> 01:29:59.875
And that just means essentially
there's no options

01:29:59.833 --> 01:30:01.708
in terms of sleeping here.

01:30:01.708 --> 01:30:03.083
And I just don't get it.

01:30:03.125 --> 01:30:04.625
I have to tell you
I don't get it.

01:30:04.625 --> 01:30:05.542
I don't get it.

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:07.458
It makes no sense to me
at all.

01:30:07.458 --> 01:30:09.625
MAN: You would think
the city as a whole

01:30:10.125 --> 01:30:11.542
would be trying
to help people

01:30:11.542 --> 01:30:13.375
that's trying to
help themselves.

01:30:13.375 --> 01:30:15.208
There's, like,
you're in this room.

01:30:15.792 --> 01:30:17.792
Well, they're trying
to put their foot
on top of your head

01:30:17.792 --> 01:30:18.792
and drown you,
you know?

01:30:18.792 --> 01:30:20.792
Just get them
on out of here,
you know?

01:30:20.792 --> 01:30:22.292
They don't deserve
a chance.

01:30:22.292 --> 01:30:23.792
Everyone
deserves a chance.
This is America.

01:30:23.792 --> 01:30:25.750
This is what
this country was
founded on, you know.

01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:28.250
Helping your neighbor,
you know,

just being good people,

01:30:30.167 --> 01:30:32.542
and Williston's not
seeing that message

01:30:32.542 --> 01:30:33.542
when they're basically
saying, you know,

01:30:33.542 --> 01:30:34.542
we're homeless.

01:30:35.042 --> 01:30:37.042
I'm not homeless.
I'm just struggling.

I have a home
in Kentucky.

01:30:38.917 --> 01:30:42.333
I just want
a better life.

I don't know
what else to do.

01:30:56.125 --> 01:31:00.292
What you do is something
that cannot be done

01:31:00.292 --> 01:31:01.792
by average people.

01:31:04.208 --> 01:31:06.625
JAY, VOICE-OVER:
To be human is to serve

01:31:06.625 --> 01:31:09.125
and to let the neighbor
change your life.

01:31:09.375 --> 01:31:11.667
I don't think we have
anymore people like you

01:31:11.667 --> 01:31:13.167
in this town.

01:31:13.167 --> 01:31:14.667
If we did, it would be
a lot better place.

01:31:17.667 --> 01:31:19.625
Thanks, you guys.
It's really been good.

01:31:19.625 --> 01:31:22.625
It's really
been good.

01:31:22.625 --> 01:31:24.667
JAY, VOICE-OVER:
I will not give in to despair

01:31:24.708 --> 01:31:27.708
because hopeless
should never win

01:31:27.708 --> 01:31:30.500
and hopeless is a lie.

01:31:59.792 --> 01:32:01.542
JAY, VOICE-OVER:
I never really felt

01:32:01.542 --> 01:32:03.583
like I belonged in Williston.

01:32:03.542 --> 01:32:08.792
I mean, the church, yeah,
but as a community, not really.

01:32:08.792 --> 01:32:12.792
Now I have ever reason
to remember

01:32:12.833 --> 01:32:14.833
why I don't belong here.

01:32:28.792 --> 01:32:31.583
JAY, VOICE-OVER: I was the one
who always preached

01:32:31.583 --> 01:32:34.958
serving others
to the overnighters.

01:32:34.958 --> 01:32:37.417
Serve the community,
serve the neighbors.

01:32:37.417 --> 01:32:42.792
And...in some of
the most fundamental ways,

01:32:42.792 --> 01:32:46.792
the relationship to my family,
I didn't serve.

01:32:48.708 --> 01:32:53.708
And I neglected the community
I was given and my family,

01:32:53.708 --> 01:32:57.250
and I have...
I have hurt them terribly.

01:33:02.458 --> 01:33:08.792
The private me distances itself
from the public me,

01:33:08.792 --> 01:33:10.583
and I can believe the public me

01:33:10.583 --> 01:33:13.583
because sometimes it looks
very good.

01:33:13.583 --> 01:33:20.417
But the private me...
has become something else.

01:33:23.417 --> 01:33:26.417
This is a hard thing to say.

01:33:26.917 --> 01:33:31.958
But in my life, I have struggled
with same-sex attraction.

01:33:31.917 --> 01:33:34.292
And I've acted on that.

01:33:38.208 --> 01:33:42.208
It's true.
I'm the one who's broken.

01:34:09.958 --> 01:34:12.417
So yesterday
I went for a drive,

01:34:12.458 --> 01:34:13.958
looking for a place
where you and I

01:34:13.958 --> 01:34:15.958
could sit and talk,

01:34:15.958 --> 01:34:17.958
where it has
no positive memories,

01:34:18.458 --> 01:34:19.958
where it's ugly

01:34:20.458 --> 01:34:24.792
so we could
have a conversation
and then leave.

01:34:29.667 --> 01:34:32.167
I have to make
confession.

01:34:37.042 --> 01:34:39.958
Terry Forke is gonna come
probably in a week or two

01:34:39.958 --> 01:34:42.917
and ask me if certain
allegations are true,

01:34:43.458 --> 01:34:45.958
and they are.

01:34:53.417 --> 01:34:54.917
Who?

01:34:54.917 --> 01:34:57.417
There's a man
who's blackmailed me...

01:34:58.917 --> 01:35:00.333
and...

01:35:21.083 --> 01:35:26.083
I've put you
in a horrible...
horrible spot.

01:35:41.125 --> 01:35:46.125
JAY: My thoughts and desires
have been soiled by sin.

01:35:48.750 --> 01:35:52.625
I have broken knowingly and
willingly the sixth commandment,

01:35:52.625 --> 01:35:55.000
"You shall not commit adultery,"

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.583
and have violated my vocation
as husband, father, neighbor,

01:35:58.583 --> 01:36:01.042
Christian, and pastor.

01:36:03.083 --> 01:36:05.583
I have served my own will.

01:36:05.583 --> 01:36:08.125
I have led others
into temptation.

01:36:08.125 --> 01:36:12.083
I've sinned against the members
of this entire community

01:36:12.083 --> 01:36:15.042
to whom I have spoken publicly
as a servant of truth.

01:36:15.042 --> 01:36:17.042
I have now tempted this
community to doubt that truth

01:36:17.542 --> 01:36:20.000
and to regard the testimony
of God's word

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:23.000
and the ministry
of this congregation as a lie.

01:36:26.208 --> 01:36:28.833
I have sinned against
my faithful wife, Andrea,

01:36:28.833 --> 01:36:31.833
who has given her life to me
and to our children.

01:36:31.833 --> 01:36:35.875
And I have exposed her
to heartache and shame.

01:36:36.333 --> 01:36:39.875
I have abused the trust
of my beloved children,

01:36:39.875 --> 01:36:41.875
who want me only to love
and serve their mother

01:36:41.875 --> 01:36:45.125
and to lead a godly life.

01:36:51.458 --> 01:36:55.208
You have trusted me,
and I have betrayed your trust.

01:36:56.708 --> 01:37:02.208
I have resigned
my position as a pastor.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:09.000
I've got to leave, but look
what I've done to my family.

01:37:15.958 --> 01:37:17.958
They're the victims here.

01:37:28.167 --> 01:37:31.167
JAY, VOICE-OVER:
So now I'm without a job.

01:37:31.167 --> 01:37:35.375
And I'm where
the overnighters were.

01:37:36.875 --> 01:37:39.375
I'm 57 years old,

01:37:39.375 --> 01:37:42.875
and I'm not quite sure
where to start.
