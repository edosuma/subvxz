00:25.831 --> 00:28.061
Honey, what is that?

00:39.102 --> 00:40.003
Found it.

00:40.004 --> 00:42.010
Dad, you should toss that.
It's getting kind of gross.

00:42.011 --> 00:44.433
Toss cookie angel?
No way.

00:44.434 --> 00:46.417
You made this for me
in first grade...

00:46.418 --> 00:48.527
with your chubby little hands.

00:48.528 --> 00:50.220
Darling, could you pick me up

00:50.221 --> 00:52.842
an extra bottle of
Aquavit for our glogg?

00:52.843 --> 00:53.958
An extra bottle of 100 proof?

00:53.959 --> 00:55.729
You're not tampering with
our sacred holiday recipe?

00:55.730 --> 00:57.803
No, no, no. I'm just gonna
make an extra-large batch

00:57.804 --> 00:59.815
to take with me
Christmas Eve caroling.

00:59.816 --> 01:01.648
Oh, it'll be after our
Christmas dinner.

01:01.649 --> 01:02.760
You don't mind, do you?

01:02.761 --> 01:05.616
But it's Christmas Eve.
That's when we open the gifts.

01:05.617 --> 01:07.769
Well, maybe we can open
them in the morning.

01:07.770 --> 01:10.271
In the morning?
Mornings are for stockings.

01:10.272 --> 01:11.314
Well, I-I think--

01:11.315 --> 01:12.831
I think what Alexis
is trying to say

01:12.832 --> 01:15.246
is that she has
other plans, too.

01:15.247 --> 01:17.371
Just with a couple of friends.
It's...

01:17.521 --> 01:19.765
What friends?
What plans?

01:19.766 --> 01:22.158
What is happening to
our family tradition?

01:22.799 --> 01:25.182
Dad, I think you're
kind of overreacting.

01:29.493 --> 01:30.989
I am not overreacting.

01:30.990 --> 01:32.873
It's--its one night
out of the year.

01:32.874 --> 01:35.313
Is it too much to ask to
stick to the program?

01:35.314 --> 01:37.441
Maybe your program
should evolve a little.

01:37.442 --> 01:39.541
It is evolving.
I invited you, didn't I?

01:39.542 --> 01:40.395
You are still coming, right?

01:40.396 --> 01:42.812
Uh, ye--I mean, if I
don't have to work.

01:42.813 --> 01:45.580
But look, okay.
No presents, remember?

01:45.581 --> 01:47.246
We promised. It's just--

01:47.247 --> 01:48.697
it's a little too stressful
this first year.

01:48.698 --> 01:49.507
No presents.

01:49.508 --> 01:50.536
I'm flexible.

01:50.537 --> 01:53.245
There are certain aspects to
this that are time honored--

01:53.246 --> 01:54.396
the--the heart--

01:54.397 --> 01:56.677
the beating heart behind
the Christmas holidays.

01:56.678 --> 01:58.811
And now Santa is dead?

01:58.812 --> 01:59.960
When will it end?

01:59.961 --> 02:02.089
Hate to break it to you,
Castle, but there is no Santa.

02:02.090 --> 02:02.940
Well, not anymore.

02:02.941 --> 02:05.792
You gotta admit, with that
beard and that belly,

02:05.793 --> 02:07.107
he looks like the real deal.

02:07.108 --> 02:08.739
If by "the real deal," you mean

02:08.740 --> 02:10.513
an overweight man in a red suit

02:10.514 --> 02:12.531
who was hopefully carrying ID.

02:12.532 --> 02:13.534
Yeah.

02:13.535 --> 02:16.114
Along with lots of
candy canes wrappers.

02:16.115 --> 02:18.274
Though I don't think
that ID of his

02:18.275 --> 02:20.335
is gonna do you much good.

02:20.523 --> 02:23.127
"Kris Kringle."
Address--North Pole?

02:23.128 --> 02:24.083
That's cute.

02:24.084 --> 02:25.839
Maybe he's the real Santa,

02:25.840 --> 02:27.367
like in "Miracle
On 34th Street."

02:27.368 --> 02:29.407
Yeah, but with no happy ending.

02:29.408 --> 02:32.144
This Santa fell out of
the sky around 9:30.

02:32.145 --> 02:33.220
From an aircraft?

02:33.221 --> 02:35.144
Maybe, but it wasn't
a commercial plane,

02:35.145 --> 02:36.324
I can tell you that.

02:36.325 --> 02:37.941
With a fall from high altitude,

02:37.942 --> 02:41.396
we'd see severe frostbite
on his eyes and his face.

02:41.449 --> 02:43.009
Hey. So I just talked
with the family.

02:43.010 --> 02:44.917
They didn't see or hear
any planes overhead.

02:44.918 --> 02:46.161
That doesn't make any sense.

02:46.162 --> 02:48.052
He had to have fallen
from somewhere.

02:48.053 --> 02:49.005
I'm sorry.

02:49.006 --> 02:51.245
Are we overlooking
the obvious here?

02:51.246 --> 02:52.886
He hit some turbulence,
slipped out of his sleigh,

02:52.887 --> 02:54.173
and fell to his doom.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.126
Santa... lying there dead.

02:56.127 --> 02:57.541
You gotta ask yourself, what
kind of world do we live in?

02:57.542 --> 02:59.407
A world in which
there is no Santa

02:59.408 --> 03:01.515
and people don't
fall out of nowhere.

03:01.516 --> 03:03.121
Can you check with
Air Traffic Control

03:03.122 --> 03:05.206
and find out what flights
were in the area?

03:05.207 --> 03:07.039
Sure. Bah humbug.

03:08.896 --> 03:10.386
So was the fall cause of death?

03:10.387 --> 03:11.907
It looks like it, but
I won't know for sure

03:11.908 --> 03:13.562
until I get him
back to the morgue.

03:13.563 --> 03:16.024
Well, Santa or no, he
sure is committed.

03:16.025 --> 03:18.010
And you're saying there's
nothing in his wallet

03:18.011 --> 03:20.778
- that indicates a break in character?
- Nope.

03:20.779 --> 03:22.276
Except for these boots.

03:22.277 --> 03:24.526
They are definitely not
from the North Pole.

03:24.527 --> 03:27.331
They're custom made from a
leather shop in Queens.

03:27.332 --> 03:29.748
Got a pair of
motorcycle boots there.

03:30.205 --> 03:32.336
Hopefully they'll have a
record of who this man is.

03:34.802 --> 03:37.125
Hey. So I heard from
Air Traffic Control

03:37.126 --> 03:38.852
but you're not gonna
like the news.

03:38.853 --> 03:40.482
They have no record of
anyone flying over the park

03:40.483 --> 03:42.148
during the time our
guy hit the ground.

03:42.149 --> 03:43.652
How is that even possible?

03:43.653 --> 03:45.132
Santa had his sleigh
in stealth mode.

03:45.133 --> 03:47.278
No. I mean, after 9/11,
how is it possible

03:47.279 --> 03:49.708
that someone can just
fly over Manhattan?

03:49.709 --> 03:51.797
Sightseeing choppers
do it all the time.

03:51.798 --> 03:53.500
There was this one time,
I took a midnight loop

03:53.501 --> 03:55.737
around the Statue Of Liberty
with this Latin...

03:58.545 --> 03:59.788
publisher.

03:59.842 --> 04:01.019
No, he's right.

04:01.020 --> 04:02.505
There's a Manhattan
flight corridor

04:02.506 --> 04:04.254
which doesn't require
you to radio in

04:04.255 --> 04:06.497
if you stay under 1,300 feet.

04:06.513 --> 04:08.538
My mother-in-law is
a licensed pilot,

04:08.539 --> 04:10.051
as she keeps reminding me.

04:10.052 --> 04:12.996
Part of a larger effort
to make me feel inferior.

04:15.322 --> 04:18.130
I'm sorry.
Did I just say that out loud?

04:18.130 --> 04:20.091
Sounds like she's staying
with you, Captain?

04:20.091 --> 04:22.638
One day soon, your
in-laws will visit, too,

04:22.639 --> 04:24.207
and when they do,

04:24.208 --> 04:25.908
think hotel.

04:26.174 --> 04:28.372
Lord, I hate the holidays.

04:29.062 --> 04:31.653
Yet another quality she has
in common with the Grinch.

04:31.654 --> 04:33.224
So if we don't know where
our Santa fell from,

04:33.225 --> 04:34.745
do we at least know who he is?

04:34.746 --> 04:35.896
Well, hopefully we will soon.

04:35.897 --> 04:37.923
Unis rousted the owner of
that boot store in Queens.

04:37.924 --> 04:40.075
They're getting him to open up
the shop and check his invoices.

04:40.076 --> 04:41.050
Lanie's got something for us.

04:41.051 --> 04:43.469
- Can you keep us posted on the boots?
- Yeah.

04:49.532 --> 04:51.380
You're taking this
one kinda hard, bro.

04:51.381 --> 04:53.479
He's a symbol of
childhood innocence.

04:53.825 --> 04:56.133
Makes me wonder what this
means for the future.

04:56.134 --> 04:58.923
It means there's gonna be one
less guy dressed up as Santa.

05:00.383 --> 05:03.009
Hey, so, uh, we're coming
up on Christmas Eve.

05:03.010 --> 05:04.561
We gonna keep the
tradition going?

05:04.562 --> 05:08.503
You, me, a six-pack,
Madden on the big screen?

05:08.504 --> 05:10.177
You know, I, um...

05:10.682 --> 05:13.700
I think Jenny has other
plans this year.

05:17.706 --> 05:18.812
Yeah.

05:20.370 --> 05:23.247
Remember how you asked if
that fall is what killed him?

05:23.248 --> 05:24.362
Well, it wasn't.

05:24.363 --> 05:26.390
I pulled this out of his back.

05:26.391 --> 05:27.926
And that is a .38.

05:27.927 --> 05:29.472
Do you still think he fell
off his sleigh, Castle?

05:29.473 --> 05:32.190
No. Clearly, he was
shot out of it.

05:32.191 --> 05:33.625
Talk about a war on Christmas.

05:33.626 --> 05:35.938
Or he was just shot in an
aircraft and pushed out.

05:35.939 --> 05:37.013
So we have anything else?

05:37.014 --> 05:39.858
Just this...
embedded in his suit.

05:39.859 --> 05:41.089
A chip of paint

05:41.090 --> 05:43.425
or some kind of
enamel, cherry red.

05:43.426 --> 05:44.519
From a sleigh.

05:44.520 --> 05:45.530
I don't know yet.

05:45.531 --> 05:47.745
I'm sending it down to
the lab for analysis.

05:47.746 --> 05:48.928
Probably from a sleigh.

05:48.929 --> 05:50.938
Are we any closer to
figuring out who he is?

05:50.939 --> 05:52.111
We are now.

05:52.112 --> 05:54.801
Name's Edmund Smith.
Lives in the Bronx.

05:54.802 --> 05:56.769
I got his ID
from that boot shop.

05:56.770 --> 05:59.915
I'm sorry. You just came all the
way down here to give me this?

06:01.080 --> 06:02.986
Yeah. I mean, you told
me to keep you posted.

06:02.987 --> 06:04.775
You did say that, right?

06:05.413 --> 06:07.858
You know what? Uh, Castle and
I are gonna go and check out

06:07.859 --> 06:10.709
the place and see
what there is to see.

06:10.753 --> 06:12.468
Okay.

06:15.793 --> 06:18.875
Javi, since when did you start
wearing cologne to work?

06:18.876 --> 06:21.116
Oh, you know, well,
it's the holidays,

06:21.117 --> 06:24.312
and I've got places
to be, people to see.

06:24.613 --> 06:25.374
How about you?

06:25.375 --> 06:27.640
Okay.
I see where this is going.

06:27.641 --> 06:29.322
I'm gonna stop you right there.

06:29.323 --> 06:31.999
I already have plans
for Christmas Eve.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.724
I'm hanging out with
my girlfriends.

06:33.725 --> 06:36.259
Oh. That's cool.

06:36.919 --> 06:38.411
Maybe afterwards,
you and I can--

06:38.412 --> 06:43.400
Javi, let's not be one of those
sad, desperate holiday hookups.

06:43.583 --> 06:45.209
But when all this dies down,

06:45.210 --> 06:47.490
if you still want
to get together,

06:47.491 --> 06:49.602
just give me a call.

06:58.828 --> 07:01.078
Um, I-I don't think he's home.

07:01.079 --> 07:02.993
NYPD.
Is there a super or someone

07:02.994 --> 07:04.101
that can let us into
this apartment?

07:04.102 --> 07:05.622
Yeah, um, we have a key.

07:05.623 --> 07:07.439
Tim, can you grab Ed's key?

07:08.151 --> 07:10.366
Did, uh, something
happen to Edmund?

07:13.311 --> 07:15.354
So when was the last
time you saw him?

07:15.355 --> 07:17.930
Well, it must have been
last night around 5:00.

07:17.931 --> 07:19.598
Uh, I saw him leave
with his costume bag.

07:19.599 --> 07:21.665
I figured he was going on a job.

07:21.666 --> 07:23.917
Ed was a professional Santa.

07:31.299 --> 07:32.967
Looks like he took his
job pretty seriously.

07:32.968 --> 07:34.342
Oh, he lived it, really.

07:34.343 --> 07:37.627
I mean, volunteering at the
rec center and the shelter.

07:37.628 --> 07:39.564
He was always here for
Tim and the kids.

07:39.565 --> 07:41.616
He--he even helped
with our lawsuit.

07:41.617 --> 07:43.092
He was a Santa and a lawyer?

07:43.093 --> 07:44.994
No, um, we lost our house,

07:44.995 --> 07:46.744
and he was just trying
to help us out.

07:46.745 --> 07:48.071
He was like that.

07:48.072 --> 07:50.147
Sounds like he got involved
in a lot of people's lives.

07:50.148 --> 07:52.684
Do you think he made any
enemies along the way?

07:52.742 --> 07:54.601
I didn't think so,
but then last week,

07:54.602 --> 07:56.299
I heard this man
pounding on Ed's door,

07:56.300 --> 07:57.960
shouting cuss words.

07:57.961 --> 07:59.202
Did you see who it was?

07:59.203 --> 08:01.365
I did. I-I looked out.

08:01.448 --> 08:04.291
It was an--an older,
tough-looking dude.

08:04.292 --> 08:05.321
When he saw me, he said,

08:05.322 --> 08:07.912
"You tell Ed if I see him
again, I'll kill him."

08:07.934 --> 08:09.582
So I-I told Ed.

08:09.583 --> 08:11.092
How did he react?

08:11.093 --> 08:12.318
Well, he told us not to worry,

08:12.319 --> 08:14.302
but you could tell he
was pretty shaken up.

08:14.303 --> 08:15.532
You think you could
describe him?

08:15.533 --> 08:18.369
You know what?
I-I don't have to. That's him.

08:21.478 --> 08:23.390
Well, whoever he is,
he's a pilot.

08:23.391 --> 08:24.866
According to the tail
number on that Cessna...

08:24.867 --> 08:27.732
the plane is registered
to a David Dunne.

08:28.136 --> 08:29.353
Guy's got priors, too--

08:29.354 --> 08:31.271
drunk and disorderly, assault.

08:31.272 --> 08:32.333
Where do we find him?

08:32.335 --> 08:33.818
Well, this just lists his
place of employment.

08:33.818 --> 08:36.030
1215 Canal Street, second floor.

08:38.962 --> 08:41.499
Wow. Someone takes
Christmas seriously.

08:41.500 --> 08:42.879
Oh, you should see our place.

08:42.880 --> 08:45.037
Our tree is a 15-foot noble fir,

08:45.038 --> 08:46.572
we have our garland shipped in

08:46.573 --> 08:49.490
from some lake I can't pronounce
by the Canadian border,

08:49.491 --> 08:51.898
and wait till you
see my train set.

08:51.899 --> 08:53.718
Yeah. Can't wait.

08:54.372 --> 08:56.285
- Hi.
- Merry Christmas.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.572
We're looking for David Dunne.

08:57.573 --> 08:58.760
Oh, Dave's in the big room

08:58.761 --> 08:59.978
teaching a class.

08:59.979 --> 09:02.167
Uh, what is it you
do here exactly?

09:02.168 --> 09:03.979
We make magic.

09:07.853 --> 09:09.425
Ho! Ho! Ho!

09:09.426 --> 09:10.248
Again!

09:10.249 --> 09:11.880
Ho! Ho! Ho!

09:11.881 --> 09:12.594
Again!

09:12.595 --> 09:14.414
Ho! Ho! Ho!

09:14.415 --> 09:16.704
Once again from the diaphragm.

09:16.705 --> 09:18.781
Ho! Ho! Ho!

09:18.782 --> 09:20.436
Outstanding!

09:20.437 --> 09:21.884
Santa school?

09:22.051 --> 09:24.476
And I bet you one
Santa is missing.

09:24.809 --> 09:27.201
Ho! Ho! Ho!

09:38.615 --> 09:41.079
This is crazy.
I did not kill Edmund.

09:41.080 --> 09:41.844
Trust me.
You're gonna have to do

09:41.845 --> 09:43.341
a lot better than
that to convince her.

09:43.342 --> 09:45.701
You can start by telling us
when you last flew your plane.

09:45.702 --> 09:47.425
Not for weeks.
You can check.

09:47.426 --> 09:49.719
We intend to.
Now where were you at 9:30 last night?

09:49.720 --> 09:51.410
I was at the Harlem Youth Center

09:51.411 --> 09:53.107
handing out gifts to kids.

09:53.108 --> 09:54.702
I wasn't anywhere near Edmund.

09:54.703 --> 09:59.442
But you did engage in some un-Santa-like
behavior at his apartment.

10:00.751 --> 10:02.205
That what this is about?

10:02.206 --> 10:03.887
That was nothing.

10:04.099 --> 10:06.264
You threatened to kill
him, and now he's dead.

10:06.265 --> 10:07.687
I wouldn't call that nothing.

10:07.688 --> 10:09.268
I can explain that, okay?

10:09.269 --> 10:10.941
See, Edmund took one
of my best gigs.

10:10.942 --> 10:12.924
It was a print ad for Cartier.

10:12.925 --> 10:14.850
I was their go-to Santa.

10:14.851 --> 10:17.698
You know, this year they wanted
to go more warm and cuddly.

10:17.699 --> 10:19.640
Well, look at me.
I-I'm warm. I'm cuddly.

10:19.641 --> 10:20.886
But, no. They chose Edmund.

10:20.887 --> 10:23.419
So, yeah, I drank too
much peppermint schnapps

10:23.420 --> 10:25.381
and went over to his
place and popped off.

10:25.382 --> 10:26.691
I'm not proud of it,

10:26.692 --> 10:28.584
but that was all I did.

10:28.585 --> 10:29.756
Did you see him
again after that?

10:29.757 --> 10:31.414
No. You have to understand,

10:31.415 --> 10:33.239
when I first met
Edmund five years ago,

10:33.240 --> 10:35.024
he was at a low point in life.

10:35.025 --> 10:37.384
I raised him up.
I taught him everything I knew.

10:37.385 --> 10:39.868
I turned him into a
world-class Santa,

10:39.869 --> 10:42.225
and now I'm losing gigs to him?

10:42.226 --> 10:43.216
Well, maybe that's it.

10:43.217 --> 10:46.384
Maybe it's time to hang up
the fluffy red jockstrap.

10:47.060 --> 10:49.417
Is... is that a metaphor
or do you really--

10:49.418 --> 10:50.961
Uh, when Edmund was killed,

10:50.962 --> 10:52.437
he was wearing his Santa suit.

10:52.438 --> 10:54.241
Do you know if he had
a job last night?

10:54.242 --> 10:55.848
You'd have to ask his agent.

10:55.849 --> 10:57.005
Santas have agents?

10:57.006 --> 10:59.355
Yeah. Mostly we use the
Bells & Holly Agency.

10:59.356 --> 11:01.956
You said Edmund was at a
low point in his life.

11:01.957 --> 11:03.435
What did you mean by that?

11:04.053 --> 11:06.887
I just think he became a Santa
to turn his life around.

11:06.888 --> 11:08.201
And it worked, too.

11:08.202 --> 11:09.483
Turn his life around?

11:09.484 --> 11:10.584
Was he in trouble of some sort?

11:10.585 --> 11:12.568
All I know is, back
when I met him,

11:12.569 --> 11:15.099
Edmund was a totally
different guy.

11:15.289 --> 11:17.191
David Dunne's alibi checked out.

11:17.192 --> 11:19.591
Harlem Youth Club said that
he was there last night.

11:19.592 --> 11:21.884
And the Cessna has been parked
in a hangar for over a month.

11:21.885 --> 11:23.756
Did you find out what Santa
job Edmund was doing?

11:23.757 --> 11:25.886
His agency said he wasn't
booked on any gigs last night.

11:25.887 --> 11:27.247
So then why was he
wearing his Santa suit

11:27.248 --> 11:28.353
and how'd he end up dead?

11:28.354 --> 11:29.261
Well, if this was a story,

11:29.262 --> 11:30.983
it would all come back
to Edmund's character--

11:30.984 --> 11:32.883
why he became a Santa
in the first place.

11:32.884 --> 11:35.137
Turns out, that's a
mystery all by itself.

11:35.138 --> 11:37.431
I've been looking into
this guy, and check it--

11:37.988 --> 11:39.996
that is Santa five years ago.

11:39.997 --> 11:41.882
Meet James Edmund Smith.

11:41.883 --> 11:44.253
He was a private equity
manager at some big firm.

11:44.254 --> 11:46.030
- That's the same guy?
- Yeah.

11:46.123 --> 11:46.866
What happened?

11:46.867 --> 11:48.554
Dedication to his craft.

11:48.555 --> 11:50.019
Like De Niro in "Raging Bull."

11:50.020 --> 11:50.877
To be a Santa?

11:50.878 --> 11:52.789
It's pretty extreme, I know,
and I'll tell you this much,

11:52.790 --> 11:54.446
he didn't go all
Santa for the money.

11:54.447 --> 11:56.909
Back in the day, he used to
pull down a half a mil a year.

11:56.910 --> 11:58.813
As Santa, he made
a tenth of that.

11:58.814 --> 12:01.123
You make that much as a Santa?
Maybe I should switch jobs, huh?

12:01.124 --> 12:03.128
What, gain 200 pounds and
have a bunch of rug rats

12:03.129 --> 12:04.739
sitting on your lap
with dirty diapers?

12:04.740 --> 12:05.927
Yeah, thanks for that visual.

12:05.928 --> 12:07.344
Oh, here's another thing.

12:07.345 --> 12:09.356
I pulled Edmund's financials.

12:09.371 --> 12:12.730
On the night he was killed, he
withdrew 2 grand from his ATM.

12:12.731 --> 12:14.533
He didn't have that money
on him when we found him.

12:14.534 --> 12:15.585
His wallet was empty.

12:15.586 --> 12:16.962
All right, take a look at
the ATM footage

12:16.963 --> 12:18.727
and see if anyone was with him.

12:18.728 --> 12:19.656
He might have been robbed.

12:19.657 --> 12:23.250
Uh, robbed and then
launched into space?

12:23.251 --> 12:25.172
And how is that less
plausible than your sleigh?

12:25.173 --> 12:27.308
I think you mean less clausible.

12:27.309 --> 12:28.378
What about his phone records?

12:28.379 --> 12:29.978
Made a bunch of calls to
some lawyer in Brooklyn.

12:29.979 --> 12:31.270
But here's the interesting one.

12:31.271 --> 12:33.790
Last phone call he ever
made was to his ex-wife.

12:33.791 --> 12:35.163
- Mrs. Claus.
- Gwenn Harwin.

12:35.164 --> 12:36.772
I went back pretty far
in his phone records.

12:36.773 --> 12:38.247
He hasn't called her for
at least three years.

12:38.248 --> 12:40.571
So he pulls out 2 grand,
calls his ex-wife,

12:40.572 --> 12:42.902
and a couple of hours
later, he ends up dead?

12:42.903 --> 12:44.121
Let's bring her in.

12:44.210 --> 12:46.855
He called me to say that
he wanted to stop by.

12:46.856 --> 12:48.320
It was the strangest thing.

12:48.321 --> 12:49.660
When he showed up,
I didn't recognize him,

12:49.661 --> 12:51.982
and now he's just... gone.

12:51.983 --> 12:53.905
I'm sorry to ask you this,
Ms. Harwin,

12:53.906 --> 12:55.852
but where were you
last night at 9:30?

12:55.853 --> 12:57.574
That's quite all right.
I understand.

12:57.575 --> 13:00.472
I was, uh, hosting a
benefit for the food bank.

13:00.473 --> 13:02.394
And why did Edmund
come to see you?

13:02.515 --> 13:03.787
To apologize.

13:03.788 --> 13:05.338
Apologize for what?

13:06.222 --> 13:08.500
For the way he walked
out on our life.

13:09.134 --> 13:11.761
We were good together.
At least, I thought we were.

13:12.699 --> 13:14.330
12 years of marriage,

13:14.331 --> 13:15.767
of building a life together,

13:15.768 --> 13:18.241
and then five years
ago Christmas Eve,

13:18.757 --> 13:20.133
we went to a party,
and afterwards,

13:20.134 --> 13:22.597
we stayed up to watch
"It's A Wonderful Life."

13:23.362 --> 13:25.394
And the next morning, he left

13:25.628 --> 13:27.502
with just the shirt on his back

13:27.503 --> 13:29.114
and no explanation.

13:29.663 --> 13:31.002
But why would he visit you now?

13:31.003 --> 13:33.564
He wanted me to know
how sorry he was

13:33.565 --> 13:35.549
for the way he left in case...

13:35.814 --> 13:37.476
anything happened to him.

13:38.618 --> 13:39.587
What did he mean by that?

13:39.588 --> 13:40.624
I don't know what he meant.

13:40.625 --> 13:43.029
I-I didn't even know
who this man was.

13:43.386 --> 13:46.609
He seemed very nervous
and very on edge.

13:46.610 --> 13:47.610
Did he give you any indication

13:47.611 --> 13:48.932
of what he was afraid of

13:48.933 --> 13:51.094
or who might have
been after him?

13:51.590 --> 13:53.030
After he left, I
went to the window

13:53.031 --> 13:55.113
to watch him get into the cab.

13:55.761 --> 13:56.633
And as the cab pulled away,

13:56.634 --> 13:59.484
there was a man on a motorcycle
who was following him.

13:59.485 --> 14:01.778
We're gonna need you to give us a
description of that motorcycle

14:01.779 --> 14:03.424
along with its rider.

14:06.274 --> 14:07.745
Early Christmas
present from Jenny?

14:07.746 --> 14:10.380
Something like that.
Would you mind not touching it?

14:10.381 --> 14:12.665
Ooh.

14:12.666 --> 14:14.258
Well, well, well.

14:14.983 --> 14:17.162
Now I see what you and Jenny

14:17.187 --> 14:19.310
got planned for Christmas Eve.

14:20.485 --> 14:22.392
Y'all gon' be getting busy.

14:24.341 --> 14:26.021
Ho! Ho!

14:26.022 --> 14:27.895
Ho!

14:30.199 --> 14:33.184
I take it this is your idea
of working the Santa case?

14:33.185 --> 14:34.670
Detective Esposito,

14:34.671 --> 14:37.064
you're supposed to be digging up
that ATM footage.

14:37.065 --> 14:38.122
And you are?

14:38.123 --> 14:40.482
Chasing down that lawyer that our
victim had been calling, Sir.

14:40.483 --> 14:42.894
Okay, then. Let's finish up
this hoochie-coochie thing

14:42.895 --> 14:44.274
and get on with it.

14:44.275 --> 14:45.360
Yes, Sir.

14:45.782 --> 14:47.165
So busted.

14:49.042 --> 14:50.558
How does "guy on a motorcycle"

14:50.559 --> 14:52.582
connect to Edmund
landing in the park?

14:52.583 --> 14:53.189
Nothing connects.

14:53.190 --> 14:54.424
Why does a man watch
a Christmas movie

14:54.425 --> 14:56.699
then walk out on everything
to become a Santa?

14:57.556 --> 14:59.853
Unless the key to Edmund's story

14:59.854 --> 15:01.100
is "It's A Wonderful Life."

15:01.101 --> 15:02.054
You remember, in the movie,

15:02.055 --> 15:04.154
George Bailey tried to commit
suicide on Christmas Eve

15:04.155 --> 15:05.214
and was saved by an angel?

15:05.215 --> 15:06.952
Which in our story
is David Dunne.

15:06.953 --> 15:08.574
Weird casting choice, I know,

15:08.575 --> 15:11.557
but what if Edmund was trying to
jump off a metaphoric bridge,

15:11.558 --> 15:12.880
you know, to start over?

15:12.881 --> 15:13.677
As a Santa?

15:13.678 --> 15:14.801
Yes.

15:15.209 --> 15:17.447
Yeah, that's where
it falls apart.

15:17.448 --> 15:19.604
Actually, it looks like
Edmund was way more

15:19.605 --> 15:21.084
than just a Santa.

15:21.085 --> 15:22.466
I finally got ahold
of that lawyer

15:22.467 --> 15:23.631
- that he'd been calling.
- Mm-hmm.

15:23.632 --> 15:25.815
She'd actually filed a suit
on behalf of his neighbors,

15:25.816 --> 15:28.489
the Cabots, who'd lost their
home to a predatory lender,

15:28.490 --> 15:29.831
Suncove Funding.

15:29.832 --> 15:31.770
Something about
illegal practices

15:31.771 --> 15:32.696
and forged documents.

15:32.697 --> 15:33.941
Anyway, it's a class-action suit

15:33.942 --> 15:36.776
representing 43 families with
millions of dollars at stake.

15:36.777 --> 15:38.634
But why was Edmund
calling the lawyer?

15:38.635 --> 15:40.376
She had been working
on contingency.

15:40.377 --> 15:41.847
She's already lost tons of money

15:41.848 --> 15:43.561
pressing the case, so she
wanted to drop the suit.

15:43.562 --> 15:45.102
But Edmund begged her not to.

15:45.103 --> 15:47.723
In fact, he asked her to
hold off just a few days,

15:47.724 --> 15:49.696
maybe he could turn
things around.

15:49.697 --> 15:50.360
How?

15:50.361 --> 15:51.547
Well, he didn't say,
but she told him

15:51.548 --> 15:52.962
the only thing that would
turn things around

15:52.963 --> 15:54.345
was a check for 25 grand.

15:54.346 --> 15:55.722
What do we know
about this company

15:55.723 --> 15:57.085
that Edmund was up against?

15:57.086 --> 15:58.937
Suncove?
It's a fly-by-night.

15:58.938 --> 16:00.487
They made their money,
then they folded.

16:00.488 --> 16:02.288
Gates actually has a
friend at the SEC

16:02.289 --> 16:03.772
trying to dig up some
information on them.

16:03.773 --> 16:05.188
Can you check with
the Fraud Division?

16:05.189 --> 16:06.414
See what they know
about Suncove?

16:06.415 --> 16:07.780
- Yeah. You got it.
- Thanks.

16:08.453 --> 16:10.614
Speaking of
"It's A Wonderful Life,"

16:10.615 --> 16:11.868
I was thinking, tomorrow night,

16:11.869 --> 16:16.769
perhaps we should have a
Christmas movie marathon or...

16:16.770 --> 16:19.844
some other kind of marathon
that makes life wonderful.

16:21.361 --> 16:23.377
- Um...
- What?

16:23.378 --> 16:26.761
Castle, look, I know how much
the holidays mean to you

16:26.762 --> 16:28.274
and I know that you
love Christmas,

16:28.275 --> 16:30.193
but I can't make it tomorrow.

16:30.783 --> 16:31.616
What?

16:31.617 --> 16:33.127
The precinct is short staffed,

16:33.128 --> 16:34.596
so I'm gonna have to work.

16:34.597 --> 16:36.787
How--to--what--don't--

16:36.788 --> 16:38.481
don't--don't you have seniority?

16:38.482 --> 16:40.437
Don't--how-- how
can this happen?

16:41.412 --> 16:42.478
Look, I--

16:42.479 --> 16:43.901
I couldn't tell Gates.

16:43.902 --> 16:45.787
She doesn't know about us, okay?

16:45.788 --> 16:48.586
So... look, I'm sorry.
I know that you're disappointed.

16:48.587 --> 16:50.039
No. Ah... no.

16:50.040 --> 16:51.852
I--it's not your fault.
I know.

16:51.853 --> 16:54.208
It's all--it's okay. I'm...

16:55.670 --> 16:57.635
I gotta get outta here anyway.
I got a date with Alexis.

16:57.636 --> 16:59.350
Gonna do some
Christmas shopping.

16:59.511 --> 17:00.853
- Okay, have fun.
- Okay.

17:00.854 --> 17:02.778
- And don't get me anything.
- Right.

17:08.212 --> 17:08.962
Hey.

17:09.339 --> 17:12.194
So, uh, I pulled this from
the ATM footage.

17:12.195 --> 17:14.140
Edmund was alone when
he took out the cash,

17:14.141 --> 17:15.775
but he did get into a cab.

17:16.073 --> 17:17.229
Any idea where he was going?

17:17.230 --> 17:19.192
Yeah, I traced the taxi he
used from the medallion.

17:19.193 --> 17:21.624
Cabbie said that he took
Edmund to Ho-Ho-Kus Field.

17:21.625 --> 17:22.913
It's a small airfield
out in Jersey.

17:22.914 --> 17:24.073
Is that where he
got on the plane?

17:24.074 --> 17:25.172
You'd think, but no.

17:25.173 --> 17:25.944
The cabbie said that

17:25.944 --> 17:27.714
Edmund had him wait so he
could go meet somebody,

17:27.714 --> 17:29.724
then he got back in the cab,
they left the airfield,

17:29.725 --> 17:31.787
and the cabbie dropped him
off in Long Island City.

17:31.788 --> 17:32.759
That doesn't make any sense.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.914
How'd he end up in the air if
he went to Long Island City?

17:34.915 --> 17:36.007
I have no idea,

17:36.008 --> 17:38.715
but the person he met with
at the airfield might.

17:38.716 --> 17:39.663
So...

17:40.006 --> 17:42.871
You, uh, pulled the
Christmas shift again?

17:42.872 --> 17:45.532
You know, you shouldn't
be eavesdropping, buddy.

17:48.216 --> 17:50.731
Espo, does that look
cherry red to you?

17:50.732 --> 17:51.880
It does.

17:51.881 --> 17:54.390
Just like the paint chip
we found on Edmund.

17:57.234 --> 17:59.269
This lock's been tampered with.

18:00.431 --> 18:02.105
Looks like it was forced open.

18:07.653 --> 18:09.227
There's fresh blood here.

18:09.994 --> 18:11.033
And lots of it.

18:11.034 --> 18:12.607
Looks like we just
found our crime scene.

18:12.608 --> 18:13.404
Yeah.

18:20.784 --> 18:22.642
Well, it looks like the
blood is a match to Edmund,

18:22.643 --> 18:24.082
but so far, there are no prints.

18:24.083 --> 18:25.643
Looks like the
cockpit's been wiped.

18:25.644 --> 18:26.897
If Edmund came down here

18:26.898 --> 18:28.300
and then he went back
to Long Island City,

18:28.301 --> 18:30.513
then how the hell did he
end up in this chopper?

18:30.514 --> 18:32.310
Well, whoever was with him has
gotta have the answer to that.

18:32.311 --> 18:33.662
Let's start with who
owns this thing.

18:33.663 --> 18:36.697
Well, according to the
airfield manager, Mr. Mudge,

18:36.698 --> 18:38.405
it belongs to a Chuck Ames,

18:38.406 --> 18:40.126
but he's on vacation in Hawaii.

18:40.127 --> 18:41.449
Hi, Mr. Mudge.

18:41.450 --> 18:43.107
I'm Detective Kate Beckett.

18:43.108 --> 18:45.536
Now is anyone else
authorized to fly that bird?

18:45.537 --> 18:46.698
Not that I'm aware of.

18:46.699 --> 18:47.612
Looks like just about anybody

18:47.613 --> 18:49.214
can have access
to this airfield.

18:49.215 --> 18:50.569
There's no checkpoints,
no cameras.

18:50.570 --> 18:51.860
We never needed any till now.

18:51.861 --> 18:54.154
The point is, if someone did
get on to this property,

18:54.155 --> 18:56.135
how hard would it be for them
to fly that chopper outta here?

18:56.136 --> 18:58.084
Anybody with a helicopter
rating could take it up.

18:58.085 --> 18:59.302
R-44 is easy.

18:59.303 --> 19:00.847
You don't even need
a key to start it.

19:00.848 --> 19:01.922
So then we're
looking for someone

19:01.923 --> 19:03.630
that knew the ins and
outs of this airport

19:03.631 --> 19:05.648
along with the fact that that
chopper was gonna be here.

19:05.649 --> 19:06.696
Maybe even someone who knew

19:06.697 --> 19:08.264
that Chuck Ames was
gonna be in Hawaii.

19:08.265 --> 19:10.652
We're gonna need
Mr. Ames' contact info

19:10.653 --> 19:12.302
along with the names of
all of your employees

19:12.303 --> 19:14.878
and everyone who's flown
through here in the past year.

19:14.879 --> 19:17.150
Hey, I-I got Christmas
lights to hang.

19:17.151 --> 19:18.752
Yeah, and we have a
murder to solve.

19:18.753 --> 19:20.199
Now is there any way to know

19:20.200 --> 19:21.824
where the chopper
flew last night?

19:21.825 --> 19:23.839
Is there a flight
recorder, GPS system?

19:23.840 --> 19:25.978
Again, she's a low-tech bird.

19:25.979 --> 19:28.465
Do you have a record of the
fuel that was in the tank?

19:30.200 --> 19:31.853
Fuel log says it was full.

19:32.040 --> 19:34.074
We can figure out how
far the chopper flew

19:34.075 --> 19:35.639
by how much fuel was used.

19:35.640 --> 19:36.947
It was down about a
fifth of a tank.

19:36.948 --> 19:39.278
The R-44 burns about

19:39.279 --> 19:41.567
4 or 5 miles per gallon,

19:41.568 --> 19:43.454
so it flew about 45 miles.

19:43.455 --> 19:44.408
That's almost exactly

19:44.409 --> 19:46.546
how far it is to Long
Island City and back.

19:46.547 --> 19:47.457
Edmund took the cab there

19:47.458 --> 19:48.829
and must have gotten
in that chopper.

19:48.999 --> 19:50.275
Okay, let's check
all the heliports

19:50.276 --> 19:52.011
in Long Island City
and find out where.

19:56.818 --> 19:59.681
I mean, it's bad enough
Santa has been murdered.

19:59.682 --> 20:01.375
This will be the
first Christmas Eve

20:01.376 --> 20:03.453
in 18 years we haven't
spent together.

20:03.454 --> 20:05.201
I mean, it sets a
grim precedent.

20:05.202 --> 20:06.400
Dad, you're being dramatic.

20:06.401 --> 20:08.739
Well, you can see
your friends anytime.

20:09.477 --> 20:11.798
Well...
what if it's just one person,

20:11.799 --> 20:14.572
and he's not really a friend?

20:15.149 --> 20:16.171
Oh.

20:16.765 --> 20:18.536
Oh, a new guy. Okay.

20:18.537 --> 20:20.250
Well, does this, uh,

20:20.251 --> 20:22.190
non-plural non-friend
have a name?

20:22.191 --> 20:23.574
- It's Max.
- Max.

20:23.575 --> 20:26.365
I met him at the annual
Bad Poetry Contest

20:26.366 --> 20:27.500
right before Thanksgiving.

20:27.501 --> 20:28.570
I see.

20:28.883 --> 20:31.692
Well, bring him along.
I would love to meet this bad poet.

20:31.693 --> 20:33.996
- Uh, y--meet my dad on Christmas Eve?
- Yeah.

20:33.997 --> 20:35.245
Tha-that's way too
much pressure.

20:35.246 --> 20:37.714
What pr--pressure to what,
eat, drink, and be merry?

20:37.715 --> 20:38.272
It'll be--

20:38.273 --> 20:40.699
Max is going to London with
his family on Christmas day.

20:40.700 --> 20:42.850
I won't get to see him
till after break.

20:42.851 --> 20:44.776
We just want to go ice
skating in the park.

20:44.777 --> 20:46.395
Yeah. Of course.
Of course. Go.

20:46.396 --> 20:47.847
Have a great time.

20:48.998 --> 20:51.163
Besides, you'll be with Beckett.

20:51.579 --> 20:52.698
Right.

20:52.877 --> 20:54.306
Oh, and don't worry.

20:54.307 --> 20:56.635
I'll be home in bed
before Santa comes.

21:00.697 --> 21:01.734
Right.

21:08.483 --> 21:09.861
Oh, Captain Gates.

21:09.862 --> 21:11.310
Y-yes, what is it?

21:11.311 --> 21:13.291
I just wanted to make
sure that you got this

21:13.292 --> 21:14.789
before you took off
for the holidays.

21:15.073 --> 21:17.763
Oh. Well, thank you,
Mr. Castle.

21:17.764 --> 21:18.741
Oh, I-I'm sorry.

21:18.742 --> 21:19.929
I don't have anything for you.

21:19.930 --> 21:22.361
Please. Just being here
each day is gift.

21:22.362 --> 21:24.842
I just wanted to let you
know how much I appreciate

21:24.843 --> 21:25.740
all that you do,

21:25.741 --> 21:27.619
you and Detective Beckett.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.097
Mr. Castle, I am
on my way uptown

21:30.098 --> 21:31.335
to meet my mother-in-law

21:31.336 --> 21:33.980
to have tea and eat those
tiny freakin' sandwiches.

21:33.981 --> 21:35.909
So why don't you just say
what's on your mind?

21:35.910 --> 21:38.374
I'm just so worried about
Detective Beckett.

21:38.375 --> 21:40.199
I mean, she works so hard.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.166
Don't you think she
deserves a little holiday?

21:42.167 --> 21:43.427
Isn't there someone
else who could take

21:43.428 --> 21:44.394
that Christmas Eve shift?

21:44.395 --> 21:46.722
First of all, how I
schedule my people

21:46.723 --> 21:48.109
is not your concern.

21:48.110 --> 21:49.164
And having said that,

21:49.165 --> 21:51.793
Detective Beckett volunteered
to take the shift.

21:54.089 --> 21:55.477
Oh. When did she do that?

21:55.478 --> 21:56.276
Earlier today.

21:56.277 --> 21:59.639
She came to me and asked to
take Detective Eldin's shift.

21:59.640 --> 22:02.041
He has a family,
and she doesn't.

22:02.280 --> 22:03.494
Okay, then.

22:04.151 --> 22:05.588
Problem solved.

22:08.759 --> 22:10.777
Okay, so that narrows it
down to five heliports

22:10.778 --> 22:12.086
in Long Island City.

22:12.087 --> 22:14.433
One is a police station.
One's a hospital.

22:14.434 --> 22:17.499
They'd both be monitored,
so that leaves helipads at

22:17.500 --> 22:18.867
Bankcorp Building,

22:18.868 --> 22:21.900
One West Hotel, and
Case Commerce Building.

22:21.901 --> 22:24.563
Case Commerce... CC.

22:27.871 --> 22:29.282
Case Commerce. CC.

22:29.283 --> 22:30.990
That's where Edmund was.

22:30.991 --> 22:32.564
Let's find out why.

22:33.939 --> 22:35.064
Hey, Castle.

22:35.065 --> 22:36.005
You coming?

22:36.795 --> 22:37.868
Yeah, sure.

22:38.884 --> 22:40.624
Oh, you can't escape it.

22:40.625 --> 22:42.501
Christmas is everywhere.

22:42.502 --> 22:44.258
So much pressure to
have a good time.

22:44.259 --> 22:45.513
Are you okay?

22:45.710 --> 22:46.514
Why wouldn't I be?

22:46.515 --> 22:48.286
Case Commerce.
There it is.

22:48.831 --> 22:51.481
Hi. Wait, uh, what's
going on here?

22:51.482 --> 22:53.251
Looks like a heist occurred
at the office Christmas party

22:53.252 --> 22:54.860
- last night.
- A heist?

22:54.861 --> 22:56.066
Well, I-I didn't notice

22:56.067 --> 22:57.792
anything was missing
until this morning.

22:57.793 --> 22:59.638
- And that's when I called you people.
- You didn't happen to have

22:59.639 --> 23:01.575
a Santa working your
party, did you?

23:01.576 --> 23:02.519
Yes, we did.

23:02.520 --> 23:04.324
Did he look like this?

23:05.173 --> 23:05.772
Yes.

23:05.773 --> 23:07.690
He was our Santa. Why?

23:07.691 --> 23:10.766
Looks like our Santa was a
little more naughty than nice.

23:16.697 --> 23:18.860
No, I never saw him
before last night.

23:18.861 --> 23:20.813
And I wasn't aware
he'd stolen anything.

23:21.149 --> 23:22.386
But given what we do here,

23:22.387 --> 23:23.661
I suppose it could've
been a lot worse.

23:23.662 --> 23:26.174
And what is it that your
company does, Mr. Case?

23:26.175 --> 23:28.869
Investment services.
Asset management mostly.

23:28.870 --> 23:31.439
Given the amount of client
and account information,

23:31.440 --> 23:33.792
we'd be a gold mine
for identity thieves.

23:33.793 --> 23:35.656
None of those systems
were touched.

23:35.874 --> 23:37.040
So what did they steal?

23:37.041 --> 23:38.609
A clock from his office in back.

23:38.610 --> 23:40.689
I'm sorry.
Did you just say "clock"?

23:40.690 --> 23:43.157
Not just any clock, Detective.
An early Tomas Tilledge.

23:43.158 --> 23:43.978
Oh.

23:44.547 --> 23:46.501
Legendary clockmaker from
the Restoration Period.

23:46.502 --> 23:47.751
That must have been
worth a great deal.

23:47.752 --> 23:49.227
I had it appraised at $30,000.

23:49.228 --> 23:50.837
Wow. How big was it?

23:50.838 --> 23:52.297
It's about this size.

23:52.298 --> 23:53.841
Small enough to fit in his sack.

23:53.842 --> 23:54.915
You know, it's hard
enough imagining

23:54.916 --> 23:57.630
one of my guests being
a thief, but Santa?

23:57.631 --> 23:59.367
Are you sure that nothing
else is missing?

23:59.368 --> 24:00.352
Positive. Why?

24:00.353 --> 24:02.706
Well, because our evidence
suggests that your Santa

24:02.707 --> 24:05.587
left by helicopter, which was
waiting on your helipad.

24:05.588 --> 24:06.963
Why would he take a helicopter?

24:06.964 --> 24:08.600
You didn't hear anything
from the party?

24:08.601 --> 24:10.082
No, but the music was loud,

24:10.083 --> 24:11.565
and the back wall
is soundproofed.

24:11.566 --> 24:13.800
Was there anything else that
was special about this clock?

24:13.801 --> 24:15.213
Not that I'm aware of.

24:15.214 --> 24:16.536
Okay, I'm gonna get
one of my detectives

24:16.537 --> 24:18.268
to come down and
interview your staff.

24:18.269 --> 24:19.931
In the meantime,
could I have a list

24:19.932 --> 24:21.342
of all of the party attendees?

24:21.343 --> 24:22.768
- Sure.
- Of course.

24:22.769 --> 24:24.199
We'll also pull elevator footage

24:24.200 --> 24:27.212
to make sure that there
weren't any uninvited guests.

24:27.631 --> 24:29.434
$30,000.

24:29.435 --> 24:30.227
That's a little more

24:30.228 --> 24:32.669
than the Cabots needed
for their lawsuit.

24:32.896 --> 24:34.348
Maybe our Santa is Robin Hood,

24:34.349 --> 24:36.215
stealing from the rich
to give to the poor?

24:36.216 --> 24:39.128
Yeah, but why would he use a
helicopter to steal this?

24:39.129 --> 24:41.481
I mean, he could've just
stuffed it in his sack

24:41.482 --> 24:43.183
and ho-ho-ho'ed outta there.

24:43.341 --> 24:45.409
It has to be about more
than just the clock.

24:45.410 --> 24:48.618
Well, there were a couple
more clocks on his workbench.

24:48.619 --> 24:50.098
Maybe this one's
significant somehow.

24:50.099 --> 24:51.700
Okay. What's your theory?

24:51.701 --> 24:54.698
Uh... treasure map inside.

24:54.699 --> 24:55.618
No.

24:55.619 --> 24:57.999
No. The clock was commissioned
by a secret society

24:58.000 --> 24:59.730
to count down the end of days--

24:59.731 --> 25:02.633
a secret society of Santas,

25:02.634 --> 25:04.136
who are the guardians of time.

25:04.137 --> 25:06.440
Oh-ho! Oh, that's good.

25:06.441 --> 25:09.054
Okay, putting aside the
mystery of the helicopter,

25:09.055 --> 25:10.981
let's say it is about the clock.

25:10.982 --> 25:12.255
How did Edmund know about it?

25:12.256 --> 25:13.887
Nobody from the office
recognized him.

25:13.888 --> 25:15.344
Well, maybe he had
worked the party before.

25:15.345 --> 25:17.061
Sorry, bro. I checked.

25:17.062 --> 25:17.756
He hasn't,

25:17.757 --> 25:20.241
but he sure was determined
to work it this year.

25:20.242 --> 25:22.363
The agency had booked another
Santa to work that party,

25:22.364 --> 25:24.260
but someone from Case Commerce

25:24.261 --> 25:25.850
called about a week
ago to cancel.

25:25.851 --> 25:27.799
Let me guess.
No one actually called from Case.

25:27.800 --> 25:29.399
- Ding ding.
- And when he arrived,

25:29.400 --> 25:31.622
they assumed he was the
Santa they'd hired.

25:31.623 --> 25:33.408
Kind of a brilliant
scam, really.

25:33.409 --> 25:35.748
You have access to high-end
homes and businesses,

25:35.749 --> 25:37.273
and who's gonna distrust Santa?

25:37.274 --> 25:39.994
Uh, his partners, apparently.

25:39.995 --> 25:42.287
No honor among thieves,
even Santa thieves.

25:42.288 --> 25:44.508
All right. Have Robbery send
that photo to pawnshops

25:44.509 --> 25:45.501
and auction houses.

25:45.502 --> 25:47.676
If his partners try to
cash in, I want to know.

25:47.677 --> 25:48.896
Absolutely.

25:51.571 --> 25:52.480
A man leaves his life

25:52.481 --> 25:54.757
and a high-paying job to
become the neighborhood saint

25:54.758 --> 25:57.544
only to get shot dead
after stealing a clock

25:57.545 --> 26:00.084
that's worth less than
your average car,

26:00.271 --> 26:02.196
and then he gets thrown
out of a helicopter

26:02.197 --> 26:03.995
that he didn't even need to
be in in the first place.

26:03.996 --> 26:05.109
It makes no sense.

26:05.110 --> 26:07.217
Given everything that
we know about this guy,

26:07.218 --> 26:09.251
this is completely
out of character.

26:09.252 --> 26:11.789
Well, sometimes people
do inexplicable things.

26:16.396 --> 26:18.455
There's an explanation
for everything.

26:18.456 --> 26:19.884
Is there?

26:20.805 --> 26:23.685
You volunteered to
take Eldin's shift.

26:23.717 --> 26:25.328
Don't pretend.

26:25.329 --> 26:28.688
If you aren't ready,
why not just tell me?

26:29.395 --> 26:30.831
I'm sorry, Castle.
I didn't mean to--

26:30.832 --> 26:32.661
You didn't mean to what?

26:33.382 --> 26:34.969
Christmas means something
different to me

26:34.970 --> 26:36.124
than it does to you.

26:36.125 --> 26:38.743
It's Christmas.
I mean, how can it be different?

26:40.095 --> 26:42.783
Castle, every winter, as
soon as that chill rolls in,

26:42.784 --> 26:45.197
I am right back there
in that alley.

26:45.307 --> 26:46.910
January 9th, and we
still haven't taken

26:46.911 --> 26:49.073
our Christmas decorations down.

26:49.074 --> 26:50.741
And by the time
my dad and I did,

26:50.742 --> 26:53.771
it was like we were putting
Christmas away forever.

26:56.878 --> 26:59.377
We haven't opened
those boxes since.

26:59.834 --> 27:00.742
I didn't know.

27:00.743 --> 27:01.814
That's why, every year,

27:01.815 --> 27:04.138
my dad goes up to his cabin,

27:04.492 --> 27:06.159
and ever since I
became a rookie,

27:06.160 --> 27:08.364
I have taken the
Christmas shift,

27:08.365 --> 27:10.372
because I know that there
are families out there

27:10.373 --> 27:12.357
that are celebrating
together in their homes,

27:12.358 --> 27:15.247
and I am keeping watch,
and that is my tradition.

27:15.248 --> 27:17.748
And that is important to me.

27:17.943 --> 27:20.384
It's as important as your
tradition is to you.

27:20.385 --> 27:22.483
And I'm sorry, Castle.

27:23.180 --> 27:24.585
I thought I could let that go,

27:24.586 --> 27:25.829
but I...

27:26.039 --> 27:27.842
I understand.

27:36.896 --> 27:37.625
Beckett.

27:37.626 --> 27:39.034
Yeah, so I got a custodian

27:39.035 --> 27:41.151
who was up on the roof
last night for a smoke.

27:41.152 --> 27:42.360
Did he see anything?

27:42.361 --> 27:44.389
Well, it's not what he saw.
It's what he found.

27:44.390 --> 27:45.651
The place was cleaned
earlier in the day,

27:45.652 --> 27:47.098
but when he got up
there, there was trash

27:47.099 --> 27:48.227
blown all over the helipad,

27:48.228 --> 27:50.340
probably from the rotor
wash when it took off.

27:50.341 --> 27:52.423
- What kind of trash?
- The kind that looked like someone

27:52.424 --> 27:54.043
had been waiting for someone--

27:54.044 --> 27:56.702
soda can, candy wrappers,

27:56.703 --> 27:59.088
and an empty pouch
of pipe tobacco.

27:59.089 --> 28:01.138
Pipe tobacco?

28:01.255 --> 28:02.950
Now who do we know

28:02.951 --> 28:05.404
that smokes a pipe and flies?

28:05.405 --> 28:06.663
And remember,

28:06.664 --> 28:08.801
when you go out there,

28:08.802 --> 28:12.422
Santa does not enter
through the chimney.

28:12.423 --> 28:14.893
He enters through the heart.

28:14.894 --> 28:16.949
What about through a helicopter?

28:19.114 --> 28:20.193
Hmm?

28:20.963 --> 28:21.895
What are you doing?

28:21.896 --> 28:23.290
- Ho!
- Put that down.

28:24.289 --> 28:25.101
- Ho!
- Are you crazy?

28:25.102 --> 28:25.948
- Ho!
- Hey!

28:29.447 --> 28:30.023
Ho!

28:30.306 --> 28:31.216
Ho!

28:35.916 --> 28:36.739
Ohh!

28:42.625 --> 28:44.523
Merry Christmas to all...

28:46.961 --> 28:48.690
And to all a good night.

28:57.382 --> 28:59.189
I already told you where I was,

28:59.190 --> 29:00.858
and it wasn't in any helicopter.

29:00.859 --> 29:01.913
Yeah, about that.

29:01.914 --> 29:04.305
We checked the photos from
the Harlem Youth Club.

29:04.306 --> 29:06.455
The Santa that was
there was not you.

29:06.456 --> 29:08.458
Where were you that
night, really?

29:08.692 --> 29:09.674
Let me help you.

29:09.675 --> 29:11.730
I just got off of the
phone with Chuck Ames,

29:11.731 --> 29:13.208
the guy that owns
that helicopter,

29:13.209 --> 29:15.834
and he said that you've
rented it from him before.

29:15.835 --> 29:17.522
So I know the guy.
So what?

29:17.523 --> 29:20.085
You got no proof that I was in
that helicopter that night.

29:20.086 --> 29:22.198
That's because you wiped it
down when you brought it back.

29:22.199 --> 29:24.759
But you took something
with you, didn't you?

29:26.849 --> 29:29.004
We found this in your apartment.

29:31.809 --> 29:33.429
Care to revise your statement?

29:34.214 --> 29:35.601
Let me help you again.

29:35.602 --> 29:37.727
Edmund figured out a way
to make a quick score

29:37.728 --> 29:38.475
for you both.

29:38.476 --> 29:39.963
He worked the party,

29:39.964 --> 29:41.895
and you were the getaway flier.

29:42.370 --> 29:44.355
And then when he got
back into the chopper,

29:44.356 --> 29:46.248
you decided you wanted
it all for yourself.

29:46.249 --> 29:49.689
All what?
All he had was that damn clock.

29:49.899 --> 29:51.664
Not just any clock.

29:51.841 --> 29:54.723
A Tomas Tilledge worth $30,000.

29:54.724 --> 29:57.478
That crap is worth 30 grand?

29:57.745 --> 29:58.743
You didn't know that?

29:58.744 --> 30:00.808
No, I-- and I didn't kill him.

30:00.809 --> 30:03.828
Come on, Dave.
You just admitted to being there.

30:04.713 --> 30:06.362
All right! I was there.

30:07.728 --> 30:08.942
Ed said he'd pay me 2 grand

30:08.943 --> 30:10.508
to fly the chopper
to that building,

30:10.509 --> 30:12.881
wait while he loaded
something on, and take off,

30:12.882 --> 30:14.795
and it wasn't no clock.

30:14.796 --> 30:16.322
He wanted to know how
much extra weight

30:16.323 --> 30:17.971
the chopper could handle.

30:17.972 --> 30:19.191
What was he planning on taking?

30:19.192 --> 30:20.386
For 2 grand, I didn't ask.

30:20.387 --> 30:22.122
I just flew to the
helipad and waited.

30:22.123 --> 30:23.272
Then all of a sudden,
here comes Edmund,

30:23.273 --> 30:25.395
running out on the
roof with the clock,

30:25.396 --> 30:26.774
yelling, "Go! Go! Go!"

30:26.775 --> 30:28.257
Next thing I know,
we're taking fire.

30:28.258 --> 30:30.043
- Someone was shooting at you?
- Hell, yeah.

30:30.044 --> 30:32.551
They nailed Edmund just as
he boarded the chopper.

30:32.552 --> 30:33.659
Did you see who it was?

30:33.660 --> 30:34.432
No, it was dark.

30:34.433 --> 30:36.383
I just cowboyed the
hell out of there.

30:37.814 --> 30:38.418
But poor Ed.

30:38.419 --> 30:40.711
I kept yelling to him
to close the damn door,

30:40.712 --> 30:43.739
but when I turned back,
he was already dead.

30:45.088 --> 30:47.166
The chopper banked hard.
Before I knew it,

30:47.541 --> 30:48.465
he was gone.

30:50.640 --> 30:51.928
Well, if Dave is
telling the truth,

30:51.929 --> 30:53.502
the shooter was
in that building.

30:53.503 --> 30:54.957
Not just in the building.

30:54.958 --> 30:57.536
The only access to the helipad
is through Case Commerce,

30:57.537 --> 30:59.540
which means our killer
was at the party.

30:59.541 --> 31:01.391
Okay, but what was Edmund doing?

31:01.392 --> 31:03.204
What was he planning on
stealing that weighed so much?

31:03.205 --> 31:05.386
And why would he take
that stupid clock?

31:05.387 --> 31:06.387
It makes no sense.

31:06.388 --> 31:07.710
It makes even less sense now.

31:07.711 --> 31:09.602
We were running through
elevator security footage

31:09.603 --> 31:11.440
and we found one person
who went up to the party

31:11.441 --> 31:13.398
who wasn't on the guest list.

31:13.399 --> 31:15.218
The neighbor kid-- Tim Cabot?

31:15.219 --> 31:16.762
And look what he's holding.

31:17.581 --> 31:18.716
A motorcycle helmet.

31:18.717 --> 31:20.488
So he was the one
that followed Edmund

31:20.489 --> 31:21.868
on the motorcycle that night.

31:21.869 --> 31:24.938
Kid's got a record, too--
B&E, assault, possession.

31:24.939 --> 31:26.639
Yeah, but what the hell
was he doing there?

31:26.640 --> 31:28.310
I think I may have an answer.

31:28.311 --> 31:30.859
Remember that class-action
suit against Suncove Funding?

31:30.860 --> 31:31.402
Yeah.

31:31.403 --> 31:33.960
My contact at the SEC
dug these up.

31:33.961 --> 31:36.381
Suncove's original
articles of incorporation,

31:36.382 --> 31:38.276
showing the name of the
account signatory.

31:38.277 --> 31:39.759
Look familiar?

31:39.760 --> 31:42.442
"James Edmund Smith,"
the victim.

31:43.079 --> 31:44.559
Santa is the shark

31:44.560 --> 31:46.346
who bilked those people
out of their homes?

31:46.347 --> 31:48.456
He has more blood on
his hands than that.

31:48.457 --> 31:50.592
Tim Cabot's father
died in a car crash.

31:50.593 --> 31:52.936
Fell asleep at the wheel
working three jobs

31:52.937 --> 31:56.199
to pay his inflated mortgage,
courtesy of Edmund Smith.

31:56.200 --> 31:57.936
That was Christmas
Eve, five years ago.

31:57.937 --> 32:00.845
The Christmas that Edmund
walked out on his life.

32:00.846 --> 32:01.670
So...

32:01.671 --> 32:03.499
It's a tale of redemption.

32:04.180 --> 32:05.362
Edmund moves next door

32:05.363 --> 32:07.178
to the family whose
lives he destroyed,

32:07.179 --> 32:09.510
dedicating his life
to repairing theirs,

32:09.511 --> 32:12.178
never telling them
who he really is.

32:12.574 --> 32:14.193
But what if Tim found out?

32:15.716 --> 32:17.046
Then it's a very different tale.

32:20.376 --> 32:21.754
I'm sorry, Mrs. Cabot,

32:21.755 --> 32:23.223
but we need to
speak to your son.

32:25.139 --> 32:26.971
Your mom doesn't know, does she?

32:26.972 --> 32:27.856
But you do.

32:28.184 --> 32:29.321
You knew who he was,

32:29.322 --> 32:30.842
and how he ruined your lives.

32:32.666 --> 32:33.420
Yeah.

32:33.421 --> 32:34.843
Yeah, I-I knew.

32:34.844 --> 32:35.477
Tim, wh--

32:35.478 --> 32:36.830
It was, Ed, mom.

32:36.831 --> 32:38.922
He was Suncove.
He's the one who bled us dry.

32:38.923 --> 32:40.088
Ed? Our Ed?

32:40.089 --> 32:42.047
You must have been pretty
angry when you found out.

32:42.048 --> 32:43.316
Hell, yeah, I was angry.

32:43.962 --> 32:46.052
When he told me, I
wanted to kill him.

32:46.675 --> 32:47.622
But I didn't.

32:47.623 --> 32:48.550
Wait.

32:48.551 --> 32:49.688
He told you?

32:49.958 --> 32:51.631
Yeah. Last week.

32:51.632 --> 32:52.647
He asked for my forgiveness

32:52.648 --> 32:54.807
and he said he wanted
to make things right.

32:54.808 --> 32:56.101
The lawyer was gonna
drop the lawsuit,

32:56.102 --> 32:57.654
but Ed said he couldn't
sit by anymore.

32:57.655 --> 33:00.033
He knew where there was evidence
that could win our case,

33:00.034 --> 33:01.015
but he needed my help.

33:01.016 --> 33:02.078
What kind of help?

33:05.837 --> 33:07.786
I'm good with locks, all right?

33:07.787 --> 33:09.820
He needed me to slip in to
the party with the waitstaff

33:09.821 --> 33:11.547
and Jimmy open the storage
room door in back.

33:11.548 --> 33:12.985
And why didn't you
tell us this before?

33:12.986 --> 33:14.307
Because I couldn't get
in trouble again.

33:14.308 --> 33:15.705
I need to be here for my mom.

33:15.706 --> 33:17.299
What was in the storage room?

33:17.644 --> 33:20.157
Files. Boxes of 'em.

33:20.158 --> 33:22.037
Edmund said that they
were the original,

33:22.038 --> 33:24.372
unaltered loan
docs from Suncove.

33:24.373 --> 33:27.039
They were the evidence he
needed to set things right.

33:27.757 --> 33:29.767
One of his old partners
must be at Case Commerce.

33:29.768 --> 33:31.137
He recognized Edmund,

33:31.138 --> 33:32.941
realized he was going
after those files.

33:32.942 --> 33:34.672
And that's why he
needed the helicopter.

33:34.673 --> 33:36.510
He couldn't exactly cart
them out the front door.

33:36.511 --> 33:38.127
And with the cops all
over the building,

33:38.128 --> 33:40.283
it would've been risky for
the killer to destroy them.

33:40.284 --> 33:41.804
Which means they're still there.

33:42.142 --> 33:43.169
Along with our killer.

33:51.679 --> 33:53.590
I tried to stop them,
but they had a warrant.

33:53.591 --> 33:55.282
What the hell is this all about?

33:55.899 --> 33:57.627
We were about to ask
you the same thing.

34:00.396 --> 34:00.999
I'm telling you,

34:01.000 --> 34:03.035
I've never seen those
files in my life.

34:03.036 --> 34:04.024
So then what were they doing

34:04.025 --> 34:06.205
in your office storage space,
Mr. Ccase?

34:06.206 --> 34:08.210
I don't have the slightest idea.

34:09.011 --> 34:10.742
Are we really gonna
play this game,

34:10.743 --> 34:14.226
where you deny things that you
and I both know are true?

34:14.601 --> 34:15.313
Like you telling me

34:15.313 --> 34:17.585
that you didn't know Edmund?

34:18.175 --> 34:19.786
We ran a background check.

34:19.786 --> 34:22.005
You and Edmund were
business associates.

34:22.007 --> 34:24.199
So why would you claim
that you didn't know him

34:24.199 --> 34:25.947
unless you were
hiding something,

34:25.949 --> 34:28.206
like your involvement
with Suncove Funding?

34:28.728 --> 34:30.818
Did the two of you talk about
how much money you could make

34:30.819 --> 34:32.521
if you could just
bend the rules,

34:32.929 --> 34:35.190
how easy it would be
to forge documents

34:35.192 --> 34:37.947
to put people into mortgages
that they couldn't afford,

34:37.947 --> 34:39.553
and how you could
make a quick buck

34:39.554 --> 34:41.155
by selling them
off to investors?

34:41.156 --> 34:44.127
There's nothing in those
files that can implicate me,

34:44.128 --> 34:46.739
and nothing to tie me
to Suncove Funding

34:46.739 --> 34:48.536
or to that man's death.

34:50.005 --> 34:52.592
That clock that was stolen,
where did it come from?

34:52.592 --> 34:54.324
I'm not sure.
I'll have to ask my decorator.

34:54.324 --> 34:55.679
Don't bother.
We already have documents

34:55.681 --> 34:57.962
that prove it belonged
to the Cabots.

34:57.963 --> 34:59.142
Who are the Cabots?

34:59.143 --> 35:01.605
One of the families
whose house you stole.

35:01.606 --> 35:04.489
They put that clock up as
collateral against a loan,

35:04.490 --> 35:06.152
and when they couldn't
make the payments,

35:06.153 --> 35:07.973
Suncove Funding kept it,

35:07.974 --> 35:08.920
and that...

35:09.341 --> 35:11.396
connects you to Suncove.

35:16.778 --> 35:18.550
When you saw Edmund that night,

35:18.551 --> 35:20.874
you realized that he was
going after the files

35:20.875 --> 35:23.179
because he was gonna blow
the whistle on Suncove.

35:23.180 --> 35:25.021
You knew that Edmund
could implicate you,

35:25.022 --> 35:26.454
so you killed him.

35:26.455 --> 35:27.575
No. You're wrong.

35:27.576 --> 35:30.734
The US Attorneys' Office
would freeze your assets.

35:30.735 --> 35:32.863
They would seize
all of your money.

35:32.864 --> 35:34.807
You were gonna lose everything.

35:34.808 --> 35:37.506
Now that is motive,
that is opportunity,

35:37.513 --> 35:40.130
and that is enough for
any jury to convict you.

35:40.131 --> 35:42.828
I did not kill Edmund.

35:44.915 --> 35:46.100
But I know who did.

35:48.519 --> 35:49.508
She was here.

35:50.368 --> 35:51.731
She stopped by the party.

35:52.601 --> 35:54.709
You must be kidding me?
Why would I kill him?

35:54.710 --> 35:56.531
Because he couldn't live
with himself any longer,

35:56.532 --> 35:57.920
with what he had done,

35:58.293 --> 35:59.636
which meant that he
was gonna take away

35:59.637 --> 36:02.138
the one thing that he left
you after the divorce--

36:02.139 --> 36:03.110
your lifestyle,

36:03.111 --> 36:05.405
paid for by Suncove profits.

36:05.406 --> 36:08.470
He didn't come to you to
apologize that night, did he?

36:09.028 --> 36:11.056
He came to warn you,
because he knew

36:11.057 --> 36:12.739
that if he blew the
whistle on Suncove,

36:12.740 --> 36:13.954
you stood to lose everything.

36:13.955 --> 36:14.574
This is absurd.

36:14.575 --> 36:16.599
You knew where he was
going and you knew why.

36:16.600 --> 36:18.262
So you followed him
to the rooftop,

36:18.263 --> 36:19.651
and then you shot him.

36:19.652 --> 36:20.532
I was at the benefit.

36:20.533 --> 36:22.269
We know you were
at Case Commerce.

36:22.270 --> 36:25.262
We have a witness.
You killed Edmund.

36:37.822 --> 36:40.405
When he left me, he told me,
he never wanted to hurt me.

36:41.033 --> 36:42.345
That's what people always say

36:42.346 --> 36:43.663
right before they hurt you.

36:46.618 --> 36:49.119
Yes, he left me my lifestyle.

36:49.120 --> 36:51.195
Five years later, he
shows up on my doorstep,

36:51.196 --> 36:54.023
telling me again how he
doesn't want to hurt me.

36:58.399 --> 36:59.791
You know what the worst part is?

37:00.749 --> 37:02.243
Just for a moment, when he
stood there that night,

37:02.244 --> 37:03.693
I was happy to see him.

37:06.120 --> 37:07.390
You got to admire the guy.

37:07.937 --> 37:10.430
Sacrificed everything
to redeem himself.

37:10.431 --> 37:12.262
It's too bad his past
caught up with him.

37:12.263 --> 37:13.747
Still, those files
are on their way

37:13.748 --> 37:15.303
to the US Attorneys' Office.

37:15.304 --> 37:18.287
Now the Cabots have a real shot
at getting back what they lost.

37:18.288 --> 37:19.911
Along with the 42
other families,

37:19.912 --> 37:21.302
all because of Edmund.

37:24.900 --> 37:27.249
Speaking of people having
their homes stolen...

37:27.250 --> 37:28.879
Is that your mother-in-law
again, Sir?

37:28.880 --> 37:31.408
Detective, if you happen
to receive a report

37:31.409 --> 37:33.126
of a homicide tonight
at my address,

37:33.127 --> 37:34.142
do me a favor.

37:34.143 --> 37:36.301
- Ignore it.
- Yes, Sir.

37:37.122 --> 37:39.716
Well, Castle.
Looks like you might have been right.

37:39.717 --> 37:41.521
Maybe there is a Santa
Claus after all.

37:41.522 --> 37:43.563
Whether there's a
Santa Claus or not,

37:43.564 --> 37:45.398
that's not why I love Christmas.

37:45.399 --> 37:45.983
When I was a kid,

37:45.984 --> 37:48.244
no matter how bad things got,

37:48.245 --> 37:51.258
my mother always managed to
make Christmas Eve magical.

37:51.259 --> 37:54.802
Every year she would put
on "The Nutcracker Suite."

37:55.247 --> 37:57.309
And I thought, if she can do
that in our tiny apartment

37:57.310 --> 37:59.535
when money was tight
and we were alone,

37:59.536 --> 38:01.383
it gave me hope that
things could get better.

38:02.877 --> 38:04.936
I love that feeling,
that sense of hope.

38:05.783 --> 38:07.208
It's crazy, you know?

38:07.507 --> 38:09.636
On the shortest, darkest
days of the year,

38:09.637 --> 38:11.762
people of all faiths
celebrate the light.

38:12.424 --> 38:14.122
Plus, who doesn't love presents?

38:25.455 --> 38:26.344
Merry Christmas.

38:26.561 --> 38:27.407
You, too.

38:43.782 --> 38:45.014
What you still doing here?

38:45.015 --> 38:46.217
Shouldn't you be at home,

38:46.218 --> 38:47.680
stuffing your wife's stocking?

38:49.892 --> 38:51.248
I don't think I'm ready, Javi.

38:51.249 --> 38:52.847
For what, sex?

38:52.848 --> 38:55.632
No, for what sex leads to.

38:55.633 --> 38:57.495
We're putting up the
tree the other day,

38:57.496 --> 38:58.932
Jenny says to me,

38:59.890 --> 39:02.568
"It just doesn't feel like
Christmas without kids."

39:03.721 --> 39:05.058
She wants to try.

39:05.597 --> 39:06.686
But I come to work,

39:06.968 --> 39:08.788
I watch the news every day...

39:09.272 --> 39:11.293
It seems like the
world's falling apart.

39:12.393 --> 39:14.081
How am I supposed to
bring a kid into that?

39:14.082 --> 39:15.895
The world's always
falling apart, bro,

39:16.550 --> 39:17.975
since the beginning of time.

39:18.860 --> 39:21.289
But having kids,
making a family,

39:21.991 --> 39:23.320
that's what keeps it together.

39:24.665 --> 39:25.419
So go home.

39:26.620 --> 39:27.517
Make a baby.

39:28.792 --> 39:29.635
You're ready.

39:30.388 --> 39:31.078
Yeah.

39:32.497 --> 39:33.318
Thanks, bro.

39:35.197 --> 39:36.026
Merry Christmas.

39:36.027 --> 39:37.870
Yeah. Merry Christmas.

39:50.647 --> 39:52.598
Mother, the glogg is excellent.

39:52.599 --> 39:53.834
- And...
- Thank you.

39:53.835 --> 39:56.306
Everything looks excellent.

39:57.300 --> 39:58.406
Just like always.

40:01.169 --> 40:02.838
Oh, Richard, Richard, darling,

40:02.839 --> 40:04.524
you don't have to
look so miserable.

40:04.525 --> 40:05.833
Oh-- she's right, dad.

40:05.834 --> 40:07.950
We know how much this
tradition means to you.

40:07.951 --> 40:10.929
So we both decided
to cancel our plans.

40:12.096 --> 40:13.489
We're here all night,

40:13.490 --> 40:14.567
like always.

40:19.300 --> 40:21.948
I love you both so much that
you would do that for me.

40:23.135 --> 40:25.428
But I was wrong about tonight.

40:27.149 --> 40:28.986
There's someplace I need to be.

40:31.167 --> 40:32.381
- Dad, I--
- Go.

40:32.979 --> 40:34.100
Go, go, go.

40:42.586 --> 40:43.358
I...

40:44.809 --> 40:46.500
Uh...
I was just coming to see you.

40:46.501 --> 40:47.948
I was coming to see you.

40:48.600 --> 40:49.539
What about your shift?

40:49.540 --> 40:50.849
I got Karpowski to cover.

40:50.850 --> 40:52.819
What about your
family tradition?

40:55.060 --> 40:57.004
I was just thinking, it's
time for a new tradition.

40:57.534 --> 40:58.341
Me, too.

40:59.292 --> 41:00.356
Oh, for God sakes,

41:00.357 --> 41:03.154
Richard, invite the girl in.

41:03.155 --> 41:04.113
Right. Would you...

41:04.114 --> 41:04.876
Yeah.

41:11.313 --> 41:12.597
It's beautiful.

41:26.225 --> 41:27.384
Merry Christmas.

41:30.170 --> 41:31.859
I didn't get you anything.

41:31.860 --> 41:32.715
What?

41:37.857 --> 41:38.686
Mrs. Cabot?

41:39.499 --> 41:41.134
I'm Detective Esposito.

41:41.743 --> 41:43.409
I have something that I think

41:43.410 --> 41:44.482
belongs to you.

41:50.593 --> 41:52.737
We found out that your husband
put that up for collateral

41:52.738 --> 41:54.527
against the mortgage
on your house.

41:54.528 --> 41:56.855
I haven't seen this for so long.

41:56.856 --> 42:00.107
It was handed down through
his family for generations.

42:00.108 --> 42:01.789
I think that's why
Edmund took it.

42:01.790 --> 42:03.153
He wanted you to have it back.

42:06.780 --> 42:07.694
Thank you.

42:10.516 --> 42:11.406
Wait.

42:12.502 --> 42:15.417
Why don't you come inside?
We're just having dinner.

42:20.577 --> 42:21.381
Okay.
