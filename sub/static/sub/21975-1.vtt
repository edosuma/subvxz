00:08.725 --> 00:10.088
My name is Nathan Fielder,

00:10.188 --> 00:13.330
and I graduated from one of
Canada's top business schools

00:13.367 --> 00:15.667
with really good grades.

00:15.767 --> 00:17.600
Now I'm using my knowledge

00:17.700 --> 00:19.567
to help struggling small
business owners make it

00:19.667 --> 00:22.367
in this competitive world.

00:22.474 --> 00:26.540
This is "Nathan for You."

00:26.633 --> 00:29.433
Mmm mmm mmm. Look at this food.

00:29.533 --> 00:31.067
You want it, right?

00:31.167 --> 00:33.033
Well, you can't have it

00:33.133 --> 00:35.933
unless you pay a visit
to Joe K's Deli Restaurant

00:36.033 --> 00:38.367
in the small town of Vernon, California.

00:38.467 --> 00:40.933
But lately, owner Steve
Mullen has been struggling

00:41.033 --> 00:43.667
to draw in customers from
the rest of L.A. County.

00:43.767 --> 00:46.933
People are not aware of us anymore.

00:47.033 --> 00:48.733
So we need something new.

00:48.833 --> 00:50.133
We need...

00:50.233 --> 00:52.133
We need exposure.

00:52.233 --> 00:54.067
The problem could be that
the last piece of press

00:54.167 --> 00:56.200
they got was from an
unknown news journal

00:56.300 --> 00:58.467
published over a decade ago.

00:58.567 --> 01:00.167
So I decided to pay Steve a visit

01:00.267 --> 01:02.733
with a plan to change that.

01:02.833 --> 01:06.733
I do watch that program
on TV with, um...

01:06.833 --> 01:09.233
What is it, "Dine and
Drive"? What is it?

01:09.333 --> 01:11.533
Oh, "Diners, Drive-ins, and Drives"?

01:11.633 --> 01:15.200
Yeah, yeah. That's
a... That's a good show.

01:15.300 --> 01:17.867
Well, you know this
isn't that show, right?

01:17.967 --> 01:20.200
- Yeah, I know it's not.
- Okay, yeah.

01:20.300 --> 01:22.900
- That's Guy Fieri.
- Yeah, that's right.

01:23.067 --> 01:24.600
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:24.700 --> 01:27.233
- Um, it's okay.
- You have to contact them, no?

01:27.333 --> 01:29.233
- I...
- How to get on

01:29.333 --> 01:31.467
- "Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives"?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:31.567 --> 01:33.833
I don't know how to get on that show.

01:33.933 --> 01:36.933
No. Well, you came through.

01:37.067 --> 01:40.067
So let's see... You
know, I'd be very happy

01:40.100 --> 01:45.067
to... work with you to
get this thing promoted.

01:45.167 --> 01:46.867
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:46.967 --> 01:48.500
One thing I've noticed that always

01:48.600 --> 01:50.233
gets restaurants press coverage

01:50.333 --> 01:53.067
is when a celebrity leaves a bit tip.

01:53.167 --> 01:55.200
If we were to get an
impersonator to pose

01:55.300 --> 01:57.933
as a celebrity and leave a $10,000 tip

01:58.067 --> 02:00.333
at Joe K's Deli, the real celebrity

02:00.433 --> 02:01.967
would never deny it was them

02:02.067 --> 02:03.633
because it make them look so good

02:03.733 --> 02:06.067
and Joe K's would instantly become

02:06.100 --> 02:07.567
the talk of the town.

02:07.667 --> 02:09.767
Okay.

02:15.616 --> 02:18.016
Yeah...

02:18.116 --> 02:19.850
Steve was excited
about my plan to get him

02:19.950 --> 02:22.150
to get him some new
press, but to pull off

02:22.250 --> 02:24.850
the illusion of a major
star leaving a giant tip,

02:24.950 --> 02:27.083
I would need a celebrity impersonator

02:27.183 --> 02:29.216
who was completely convincing.

02:29.316 --> 02:32.550
So I held an open audition to
see if anyone had the goods.

02:34.950 --> 02:38.216
Do not go in there.

02:38.316 --> 02:41.016
Whoo!

02:41.116 --> 02:44.250
Yikes.

02:44.350 --> 02:47.716
Well, all righty then.

02:49.516 --> 02:52.050
So are you a Jim Carey impersonator

02:52.150 --> 02:54.750
or an Ace Ventura impersonator?

02:54.850 --> 02:58.016
I guess, uh, I'm more
focused towards Ace.

02:58.116 --> 03:01.483
Um, but I'm a little
bit of Jim Carey overall.

03:01.583 --> 03:03.450
With all the talent that came in,

03:03.550 --> 03:05.250
it was hard to decide who would be best

03:05.350 --> 03:06.583
for this critical role.

03:11.450 --> 03:13.016
So once the auditions were done,

03:13.116 --> 03:14.516
I brought the footage to Joe K's

03:14.616 --> 03:16.550
to see who Steve liked the most.

03:16.650 --> 03:19.983
He doesn't look like Bill Gates.

03:20.083 --> 03:21.850
When I founded Microsoft...

03:21.950 --> 03:23.950
I don't think this guy will work.

03:23.983 --> 03:26.350
Steve turned out to be
a pretty tough audience.

03:26.450 --> 03:29.550
Can you feel it? Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

03:29.650 --> 03:31.616
- No.
- And of the dozens of options

03:31.716 --> 03:33.516
I showed him, he seemed to only connect

03:33.616 --> 03:35.183
with one.

03:35.283 --> 03:38.050
Jerry. Jerry, I'm pleading with you.

03:38.150 --> 03:40.850
I-I like this guy.

03:40.950 --> 03:43.216
- Kramer from "Seinfeld"?
- Yes.

03:43.316 --> 03:45.483
The guy was a dead ringer
for Michael Richards

03:45.583 --> 03:47.750
who played Kramer on "Seinfeld."

03:47.850 --> 03:50.283
I was a little concerned
about his relevance.

03:50.383 --> 03:52.516
Do you think he might
be a little bit dated?

03:52.616 --> 03:54.950
Maybe, but a lot of people know him.

03:54.983 --> 03:57.516
But Steve loved him,
so we officially decided

03:57.616 --> 03:59.483
that Michael Richards
would be the celebrity

03:59.583 --> 04:01.783
leaving the tip and later that week,

04:01.950 --> 04:04.216
I had our impersonator
meet me at a rehearsal space

04:04.316 --> 04:06.283
I rented so we could
run through the plan.

04:06.383 --> 04:09.083
Is this something you
do full-time, or...

04:09.183 --> 04:12.216
Well, I was... for a
while I was doing it a lot.

04:12.316 --> 04:14.516
I was doing it a lot
and then when Michael...

04:14.616 --> 04:17.550
When Michael Richards... When
he had his little problem,

04:17.649 --> 04:19.750
like after The Comedy Store... Right.

04:19.850 --> 04:23.116
My persona was... for a little while,

04:23.216 --> 04:26.016
- corporately non gratis.
- Right.

04:26.116 --> 04:28.683
I know Michael Richards is a great guy.

04:28.783 --> 04:31.216
I know he's not racist.

04:31.316 --> 04:33.950
I began by asking
Ostrow to walk me through

04:34.050 --> 04:36.350
how he would leave a
large tip at a restaurant

04:36.450 --> 04:38.850
as Michael Richards to
be sure his performance

04:38.950 --> 04:40.316
was realistic.

04:40.416 --> 04:42.750
And... whenever you're ready.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:07.383 --> 05:10.083
It was clear right away
that we had some work to do.

05:10.183 --> 05:13.250
I think it might be a
little bit too... big.

05:13.350 --> 05:15.616
Remember, people need to
believe you're Michael Richards,

05:15.716 --> 05:17.283
- not Kramer.
- Oh.

05:17.383 --> 05:18.950
- Got it. Okay.
- Okay. Cool.

05:19.016 --> 05:20.583
But after hours of rehearsal,

05:20.683 --> 05:21.950
it felt like we were getting closer

05:21.983 --> 05:23.950
to a believable performance.

05:23.983 --> 05:26.450
- A lot better.
- That's what I do.

05:26.550 --> 05:29.083
But to pull off this tip under
the scrutiny of the media,

05:29.183 --> 05:31.150
the details would matter.

05:31.250 --> 05:33.983
It seemed like the centerpiece
of every celebrity tipping story

05:34.083 --> 05:36.116
is a photo of the transaction receipt

05:36.216 --> 05:38.983
with the celebrity's full
name and account number on it.

05:39.083 --> 05:41.116
If we fake the receipt, there's a chance

05:41.216 --> 05:43.823
a nosy journalist could
verify the transaction

05:43.910 --> 05:45.610
and expose the fraud.

05:45.744 --> 05:47.744
So if we really wanted
it to appear real,

05:47.802 --> 05:50.069
We'd have to use a bank card
that was owned by someone

05:50.177 --> 05:52.344
with the same name as our celebrity.

05:52.444 --> 05:54.577
So I started calling
every Michael Richards

05:54.744 --> 05:57.377
listed the local white
pages to ask for permission

05:57.477 --> 06:00.344
to borrow their bank card
for a one-time transaction

06:00.444 --> 06:01.944
they'd be fully reimbursed for.

06:02.051 --> 06:03.884
- ...and for...
- _

06:03.892 --> 06:08.439
_

06:09.295 --> 06:14.372
_

06:14.477 --> 06:17.106
But unfortunately, none
of them would help me out.

06:17.193 --> 06:19.935
_

06:19.944 --> 06:22.577
Ok... hello? Mr. Richards?

06:22.744 --> 06:25.244
For a moment, I thought
I was all out of options,

06:25.344 --> 06:27.744
but then it occurred to me
that if we could find someone

06:27.777 --> 06:30.744
who was willing to temporarily
change their legal name

06:30.810 --> 06:32.477
to Michael Richards, we'd be able

06:32.577 --> 06:34.577
to open up a bank
account on their behalf

06:34.744 --> 06:38.081
and get the debit card we needed
to make the transaction real.

06:38.167 --> 06:41.910
And after posting several
ads, we finally got a response.

06:42.010 --> 06:44.277
- What's your full name?
- Robert Paul Holmes.

06:44.377 --> 06:46.877
So can I ask why you
wanna change your name?

06:46.977 --> 06:48.577
I've been Paul for a long time.

06:48.744 --> 06:51.377
Since I was a kid, uh,
I think probably five.

06:51.477 --> 06:53.377
Um...

06:53.477 --> 06:55.477
my family started calling
me by my middle name

06:55.577 --> 06:58.010
and it just stuck. So you just wanted

06:58.110 --> 06:59.777
- to be Paul Holmes?
- Yeah.

06:59.877 --> 07:02.977
Okay, for this project,
I'm willing to pay you...

07:03.077 --> 07:04.410
- Mm-hmm.
- To change your name

07:04.510 --> 07:07.777
- to Michael Richards.
- Okay.

07:07.877 --> 07:10.177
Why?

07:10.277 --> 07:12.977
We're trying to make it
seem like a man by that name

07:13.077 --> 07:15.377
left a big tip at a restaurant.

07:15.477 --> 07:17.944
- Okay.
- And...

07:18.044 --> 07:21.610
for that I'd be willing
to pay you $1,000.

07:27.777 --> 07:29.477
Uh, what's going through
my brain right now

07:29.577 --> 07:31.877
is the huge pain in the ass this is.

07:31.977 --> 07:33.944
You know? Uh...

07:34.044 --> 07:36.510
and I'm thinking if $1,000 is worth it.

07:36.610 --> 07:38.310
Um...

07:38.410 --> 07:39.744
I mean, is this a yard sale?

07:39.844 --> 07:42.344
Can I counter offer with some money?

07:42.444 --> 07:44.610
What amount do you
feel comfortable with?

07:44.744 --> 07:47.010
14's in my head. I like it.

07:47.110 --> 07:48.877
Uh, you can counter offer with 12.

07:48.977 --> 07:51.044
Whatever man, you know?
Give me anything over 1,000

07:51.144 --> 07:53.210
and I'll think that I win.

07:53.310 --> 07:57.477
- So, like, $1,001?
- Mm-hmm.

07:57.577 --> 07:59.477
- You'd be happy with that?
- Yeah, sure.

07:59.577 --> 08:02.144
Okay. So, she we do $1,001?

08:02.244 --> 08:03.477
Sure. Yes.

08:03.577 --> 08:05.110
- I mean, is that...
- Mm-hmm.

08:05.210 --> 08:06.810
- As long as you're happy.
- I am happy.

08:06.910 --> 08:07.649
I just wanna make sure
you're happy with that.

08:07.753 --> 08:08.493
Mm-hmm.

08:08.766 --> 08:11.177
Okay, well, it was great
negotiating with you.

08:11.277 --> 08:12.810
- Yeah, good.
- I'm an easy negotiator, man.

08:12.910 --> 08:14.177
- Yeah, great.
- Yeah.

08:14.277 --> 08:16.744
- Well thank you.
- Absolutely.

08:16.955 --> 08:18.855
After settling on an
amount that we are both

08:18.955 --> 08:20.755
happy with, I had Paul
fill out the legal paperwork

08:20.855 --> 08:25.475
that was required to begin
the name change process.

08:25.546 --> 08:28.413
But that's when I realize
we had a big problem.

08:28.514 --> 08:30.680
To complete a name change in California,

08:30.814 --> 08:33.813
you're legally obligated to
publically announce the change

08:33.914 --> 08:35.914
in a newspaper of general circulation

08:36.014 --> 08:38.080
for four weeks in a row.

08:38.179 --> 08:40.812
If anyone suspected that the
Michael Richards tip was fake,

08:41.070 --> 08:42.770
finding this name change in the paper

08:42.870 --> 08:44.636
would be their smoking gun.

08:44.736 --> 08:47.603
I tried calling my legal
advisor Judge Anthony Filosa

08:47.703 --> 08:49.336
to see if there was any way around this.

08:49.470 --> 08:50.970
You have to publish it?

08:51.070 --> 08:52.903
You can't just change
your name secretly?

08:52.996 --> 08:58.285
_

08:58.470 --> 09:00.370
But unfortunately, there wasn't.

09:00.470 --> 09:02.536
So I felt like the only way to do this

09:02.636 --> 09:05.470
while maintaining our secrecy
was by creating a newspaper

09:05.536 --> 09:07.470
that no one would ever read.

09:07.570 --> 09:09.870
My hope was that by calling
it "The Diarrhea Times,"

09:09.970 --> 09:12.336
no one would ever want to pick it up,

09:12.470 --> 09:15.570
but to ensure our publication
seemed legitimate to the courts,

09:15.670 --> 09:18.936
I rented us an office space
in a media building downtown

09:19.036 --> 09:20.936
and hired a professional
ghost writer named

09:21.036 --> 09:23.536
Austin Bowers... who once
wrote me an entire book

09:23.636 --> 09:25.570
in less than a week,
to serve as the paper's

09:25.670 --> 09:27.236
Editor-in-Chief.

09:27.336 --> 09:29.070
You ever been the editor
of a newspaper before?

09:29.170 --> 09:31.570
Nope, this'll be the first time.

09:31.670 --> 09:33.570
The paper would obviously need content

09:33.670 --> 09:35.870
and it seemed like
Austin had a big vision.

09:35.970 --> 09:39.736
Um... definitely wanna
include lots of topics:

09:39.836 --> 09:42.636
um, business, arts, politics.

09:42.736 --> 09:45.536
Draw lots of people in and they'll come.

09:45.636 --> 09:47.003
They'll read. They'll share.

09:47.103 --> 09:48.903
Right? Just make sure there's a section

09:49.003 --> 09:50.903
for name change announcements? Okay?

09:51.003 --> 09:53.336
- Right.
- I felt a little bad for Austin

09:53.470 --> 09:55.503
that no one would be
reading this newspaper,

09:55.603 --> 09:58.203
but hopefully, it will be a
valuable experience for him

09:58.303 --> 10:00.703
that would lead to future opportunities.

10:00.803 --> 10:02.336
So after having him introduce himself

10:02.436 --> 10:04.036
to the other tenants in the building,

10:04.136 --> 10:05.870
to add to the paper's legitimacy...

10:05.970 --> 10:08.370
I'm the Editor-in Chief
of "The Diarrhea Times."

10:08.470 --> 10:10.270
- We're new in the building.
- Uhhuh?

10:10.370 --> 10:12.903
Austin got to work and a few days later,

10:13.003 --> 10:16.203
I was excited to learn that
our first edition was complete.

10:16.303 --> 10:18.770
Your lead story is a movie review of

10:18.870 --> 10:21.203
"Nick & Nora's Infinite Playlist"?

10:21.303 --> 10:24.370
Yup, it is my favorite
movie of all time.

10:24.470 --> 10:26.736
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

10:26.836 --> 10:32.436
I feel like how they came
together was kinda beautiful.

10:32.536 --> 10:36.370
I'd like to find something
like that one day.

10:38.736 --> 10:43.603
- Are you single?
- I am. Yes.

10:46.503 --> 10:49.570
What about you?

10:49.670 --> 10:51.436
Yeah, I'm single.

11:04.503 --> 11:05.803
- You wanna see the...
- Yeah, let's see

11:05.903 --> 11:07.603
what else you got.

11:07.703 --> 11:09.370
Austin walked me through
the rest of the paper

11:09.470 --> 11:11.570
which included articles
on entertainment,

11:11.670 --> 11:13.570
current events, and even a section

11:13.670 --> 11:16.203
for political cartoons
that he drew himself.

11:16.303 --> 11:17.870
That supposed to be Donald Trump?

11:17.970 --> 11:19.936
- Yes.
- And after including the name

11:20.036 --> 11:22.570
change announcement in the
bottom corner of page three,

11:22.670 --> 11:24.903
next to an op-ed
about "Zelda Symphony,"

11:25.003 --> 11:27.236
the first issue was ready to print.

11:27.336 --> 11:29.136
So you're gonna start
working on the next issue?

11:29.236 --> 11:31.170
- Yes.
- Okay, awesome.

11:31.270 --> 11:33.770
So after receiving thousands
of copies back from the printer,

11:33.870 --> 11:37.170
we circulated our inaugural
issue of "The Diarrhea Times"

11:37.270 --> 11:39.103
to the dozens of distribution partners

11:39.203 --> 11:41.270
we had set up around L.A. County.

11:41.370 --> 11:44.470
Meeting the minimum requirements
to be recognized by the courts

11:44.536 --> 11:46.603
as a legitimate publication.

11:46.703 --> 11:49.470
Since California law dictates
the name change be published

11:49.570 --> 11:52.103
for four weeks in a
row, over the next month,

11:52.203 --> 11:54.036
Austin wrote three more issues

11:54.136 --> 11:56.103
with the name change
announcement in each

11:56.203 --> 11:59.236
that were made publically
available to L.A. residents.

11:59.470 --> 12:01.603
So with all the legal
requirements now met,

12:01.703 --> 12:04.336
Robert Paul Holmes was
given a date to appear

12:04.470 --> 12:07.003
at the L.A. Superior
Courthouse where his name change

12:07.103 --> 12:09.170
to Michael Richards was approved.

12:09.270 --> 12:11.170
Here I am. I am officially
Michael Richards.

12:11.270 --> 12:14.136
Which is... weird and...

12:14.236 --> 12:18.070
again, I'm not relating
to it that much, but...

12:18.170 --> 12:20.070
time will tell, I guess.

12:20.170 --> 12:22.703
With his new identification,
he was now able to open

12:22.803 --> 12:25.270
a bank account under
the name Michael Richards

12:25.370 --> 12:28.303
and receive a Visa/debit card
that would hopefully stand up

12:28.470 --> 12:31.836
to media scrutiny when our
impersonator left the tip.

12:31.936 --> 12:34.070
Now, all we had to do
was fund the account

12:34.170 --> 12:36.536
with the money we needed
for the transaction.

12:36.636 --> 12:39.303
Because the production
has limited cash on hand,

12:39.470 --> 12:42.336
I decided to borrow
the $10,000 for the tip

12:42.470 --> 12:45.036
from the bank account of a
Holocaust Awareness Charity

12:45.136 --> 12:47.136
that I started knowing
that I'd get it back

12:47.236 --> 12:49.603
from the restaurant once
the tip was complete,

12:49.703 --> 12:51.803
but when I called up
Michael to schedule a time

12:51.903 --> 12:54.370
to make the deposit,
he casually brought up

12:54.470 --> 12:56.903
that the last time he
had handled this much cash

12:57.003 --> 12:58.870
was when he stole it from someone.

12:58.970 --> 13:01.336
So what was the charge?

13:01.403 --> 13:08.563
_

13:09.836 --> 13:10.870
Okay.

13:11.161 --> 13:15.395
_

13:15.636 --> 13:17.736
Michael told me that
he was once involved

13:17.836 --> 13:20.303
in an armed robbery and
even though the crime

13:20.470 --> 13:22.103
occurred almost a decade ago,

13:22.203 --> 13:24.470
I became very concerned
that once the money

13:24.536 --> 13:27.803
was in his account, he'd be
tempted to take it and flee.

13:27.903 --> 13:30.303
After all, if this guy changed his name

13:30.470 --> 13:33.270
to Michael Richards for $1,001,

13:33.370 --> 13:37.970
I couldn't imagine what
he would do for 10,000.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.518
So, as you know, I'm gonna be, like,

13:39.618 --> 13:41.680
- depositing $10,000 cash...
- Yup.

13:41.766 --> 13:43.516
- Into your account.
- Uh-huh.

13:43.618 --> 13:45.451
And, uh, I was just
thinking, like, after the...

13:45.551 --> 13:48.042
the call we had where you...

13:48.137 --> 13:51.570
where you told me you
had committed, uh...

13:51.670 --> 13:53.404
- armed robbery...
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

13:53.504 --> 13:55.170
Yeah.

13:55.270 --> 13:57.137
- I was a little nervous...
- Yeah. Yeah.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.504
- Just about...
- Makes sense.

13:58.604 --> 14:00.404
- And I trust you. Yeah.
- Cool.

14:00.504 --> 14:01.937
Like, I trust you. I know
it was a long time ago.

14:02.037 --> 14:04.570
- Yeah. Yeah.
- But I was thinking,

14:04.670 --> 14:07.104
just if it makes me, like...

14:07.204 --> 14:10.137
if it makes it a little bit safer, um...

14:10.237 --> 14:12.537
would you be comfortable
just being handcuffed

14:12.637 --> 14:17.670
to me until tomorrow when
we... I actually do the tip?

14:20.804 --> 14:23.604
No. Wait, what?

14:25.404 --> 14:27.170
So you want me to be
handcuffed to you for 24 hours?

14:27.270 --> 14:29.804
I mean, just 'cause the
money will be in your account.

14:29.904 --> 14:31.804
Right. Right. Right. Right.

14:31.904 --> 14:34.170
Ah, I got ya. I got
ya. I got ya. I got ya.

14:34.270 --> 14:35.470
I'm having a hard time following.

14:35.570 --> 14:37.004
So we're gonna deposit the money

14:37.104 --> 14:38.604
and then I'm gonna
handcuff myself to you...

14:38.704 --> 14:40.170
- Yeah.
- So I don't leave and go take

14:40.270 --> 14:42.170
- that shit out.
- Exactly. Yes.

14:42.270 --> 14:43.637
- I'm following you now.
- Yeah.

14:43.737 --> 14:45.337
We'd be handcuffed before we go in.

14:45.437 --> 14:46.604
Just like right now.

14:49.437 --> 14:51.804
- I mean...
- Sure. Yeah.

14:51.904 --> 14:53.404
You know, I don't have
anything going on today.

14:53.504 --> 14:55.504
- it.
- I mean, I definitely want

14:55.604 --> 14:57.070
you to be comfortable with it.

14:57.170 --> 15:00.104
Yeah, yeah. I think
it's a weird request,

15:00.204 --> 15:01.937
but now that you
explained it a little more,

15:02.037 --> 15:04.204
I understand where you're
coming from and I get the logic.

15:04.304 --> 15:05.604
- Yeah.
- Totally get the logic.

15:05.704 --> 15:08.070
- Cool.
- And... yeah, again, sure.

15:08.170 --> 15:10.237
Thanks. Yeah, it would just
make me feel more comfortable.

15:10.337 --> 15:12.670
- Cool, man.
- After a bit of convincing,

15:12.770 --> 15:14.904
Michael Richards agreed
to be handcuffed to me

15:14.937 --> 15:17.637
for a full 24 hours
until the tipping plan

15:17.737 --> 15:19.337
was completed the following day.

15:19.437 --> 15:21.904
It might be best if we
do it in a way where it...

15:21.970 --> 15:24.104
we can make it look like
we're just holding hands...

15:24.204 --> 15:26.904
so it doesn't look suspicious, you know?

15:26.970 --> 15:31.337
- 'Cause we're going into a bank.
- Sure.

15:31.437 --> 15:33.504
And once Michael was
locked in beside me,

15:33.604 --> 15:37.637
it was time to head
out to make the deposit.

15:37.737 --> 15:40.270
Entering a bank
handcuffed to another man

15:40.370 --> 15:42.104
is a very risky maneuver,

15:42.204 --> 15:44.004
so I was hopeful
people would just see us

15:44.104 --> 15:46.904
as two close friends
making a deposit together.

15:46.937 --> 15:48.537
- Thank you, man.
- Thanks.

15:48.630 --> 15:50.201
_

15:50.270 --> 15:53.404
Oh, hanging out. Enjoying
the... the clouds.

15:53.482 --> 15:54.505
_

15:54.570 --> 15:56.604
- Mm-hmm.
- _

15:56.704 --> 15:58.270
Good. Yeah, you as well.

15:58.370 --> 15:59.737
- Thank you.
- See ya.

15:59.904 --> 16:01.070
Thank you. And with that,

16:01.170 --> 16:03.037
the account was fully funded.

16:03.137 --> 16:05.470
But since I needed to
stay handcuffed to Michael

16:05.570 --> 16:08.904
until noon tomorrow when the
tip was scheduled to take place,

16:08.937 --> 16:12.337
I booked us adjoining hotel
rooms for us to spend the night.

16:12.437 --> 16:15.070
So once inside, I switched
our traditional handcuffs

16:15.170 --> 16:16.670
for some custom ones I had made

16:16.770 --> 16:18.337
with an extra-long chain

16:18.437 --> 16:20.270
so we'd be able to have our own space

16:20.370 --> 16:22.104
so I could be sure he wouldn't run off

16:22.204 --> 16:23.937
in the middle of the
night. Have a good night.

16:24.037 --> 16:28.104
You, too, my friend.

16:28.204 --> 16:30.670
It was a little uncomfortable at first,

16:30.770 --> 16:33.737
but after we each negotiated
a fair amount of slack,

16:33.904 --> 16:35.970
I was able to go to
bed knowing that Michael

16:36.070 --> 16:39.904
and my Holocaust money
wasn't going anywhere.

16:44.530 --> 16:46.486
After a night of subpar sleep,

16:46.513 --> 16:48.080
it was time for the big day.

16:48.173 --> 16:50.439
So I unlocked myself from the cuffs

16:50.539 --> 16:52.973
and secretly snuck out without
telling Michael I had left

16:53.073 --> 16:55.539
I then met up with our
Michael Richards impersonator

16:55.673 --> 16:58.039
near Joe K's Restaurant
to give him the debit card

16:58.139 --> 17:00.373
he'd be using for the transaction.

17:00.481 --> 17:03.539
So you feel good about all
this? I'm good. I'm ready.

17:03.688 --> 17:06.355
Let's make it happen. Giddy up!

17:06.454 --> 17:07.855
Okay. Um...

17:07.954 --> 17:09.222
Just remember, you're Michael Richards,

17:09.288 --> 17:10.521
- not Kramer.
- Yeah.

17:10.622 --> 17:11.821
- Right? Got it?
- Yeah. Yeah.

17:11.922 --> 17:13.009
Okay, great. All right.

17:13.117 --> 17:16.454
Before Joe K's open that day,
my crew had set up cameras

17:16.555 --> 17:18.521
throughout the diner so I could monitor

17:18.622 --> 17:20.191
everything that happened
from a surveillance van

17:20.402 --> 17:21.362
down the block.

17:21.488 --> 17:23.155
So with the lunch rush in full swing,

17:23.255 --> 17:26.055
it was time for Michael
Richards to arrive.

17:26.155 --> 17:28.088
The plan was for
customers to take notice

17:28.188 --> 17:30.888
once the tip happened in
the hopes word would spread

17:30.988 --> 17:33.888
to the local press so I
instructed our impersonator

17:33.988 --> 17:35.821
to keep a low profile at first

17:35.921 --> 17:37.455
and order whatever dish he felt

17:37.555 --> 17:39.455
the real Michael Richards would have.

17:39.521 --> 17:40.788
Okay, you all ready, sir?

17:40.888 --> 17:42.688
- I believe I am.
- Okie dokey.

17:42.788 --> 17:44.088
What we having today?

17:44.188 --> 17:47.121
Mmm... All right, I'm gonna go

17:47.221 --> 17:50.621
- veggie melt.
- Okay, one veggie melt.

17:50.721 --> 17:53.621
The staff was fully prepped
on what was about to happen

17:53.721 --> 17:56.121
and we went through extensive
rehearsals to make sure

17:56.221 --> 17:57.788
everything ran like clockwork.

17:57.888 --> 17:59.221
I'm gonna go... we're gonna go with

17:59.321 --> 18:00.855
the vegetaria... the veggie melt.

18:00.955 --> 18:02.955
Okay, one veggie melt.

18:03.055 --> 18:05.688
But the only thing that
really mattered was the tip.

18:05.788 --> 18:07.521
So to ensure the
signature on the receipt

18:07.621 --> 18:09.621
would be authentic, I had a light box

18:09.721 --> 18:11.821
built into the back of
one of the restaurant's

18:11.921 --> 18:14.621
check holders with a traceable
overlay of Michael Richard's

18:14.721 --> 18:17.221
actual signature that I found online.

18:17.321 --> 18:20.755
So once he was done eating,
and the restaurant ran the card,

18:20.855 --> 18:23.855
it was time for the
pivotal moment of my plan.

18:23.955 --> 18:26.455
Thank you very much. Glad
you enjoyed your lunch.

18:26.488 --> 18:27.688
You have a wonderful, wonderful day

18:27.788 --> 18:29.588
and a great weekend as well.

18:29.688 --> 18:31.688
And my heart was racing
as our impersonator

18:31.788 --> 18:34.255
filled in the largest
tip to ever be left

18:34.355 --> 18:36.888
on a $14.00 sandwich.

18:38.955 --> 18:40.921
And after having him exit quietly,

18:41.021 --> 18:44.188
it was time for Steve's server
to execute the surprise reaction

18:44.288 --> 18:47.355
we had rehearsed so many times.

18:47.455 --> 18:49.621
Oh, my God.

18:49.721 --> 18:53.188
Oh, my God. $10,000 tip?

18:53.288 --> 18:54.588
Are you kidding me?

18:54.688 --> 18:56.688
Steve, Linda. What is it?

18:56.788 --> 19:00.021
- God. $10,000 tip.
- That says $10,000.

19:00.121 --> 19:01.821
- No way. What?
- A $10,000 tip.

19:01.921 --> 19:03.321
- That's crazy.
- Who is this guy?

19:03.455 --> 19:04.821
- $10,000?
- It was Kramer.

19:04.921 --> 19:06.688
I think it was Kramer from "Seinfeld."

19:06.788 --> 19:08.288
Michael Richards? Michael Richards?

19:08.455 --> 19:10.121
- Yeah.
- The staff's performances

19:10.221 --> 19:12.888
were flawless and our
waiter made a huge point

19:12.988 --> 19:14.621
of ensuring that
everyone in the restaurant

19:14.721 --> 19:16.821
knew about the generous tip.

19:16.921 --> 19:18.155
I couldn't believe
it, man. It was Mike...

19:18.255 --> 19:19.555
It was Kramer from "Seinfeld."

19:19.655 --> 19:21.755
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

19:21.855 --> 19:24.088
Michael Richards. The guy
Kramer from "Seinfeld."

19:24.188 --> 19:25.688
- Oh!
- Just ate...

19:25.788 --> 19:27.455
I was hopeful this would be enough

19:27.562 --> 19:30.121
for word to spread to the local media.

19:30.216 --> 19:32.162
_

19:32.221 --> 19:34.755
And lucky for us, it was.

19:34.855 --> 19:36.921
This next story is so
wild it might belong

19:37.021 --> 19:39.755
in a "Seinfeld" episode,
and it apparently involves

19:39.855 --> 19:42.021
a cast member from that hit TV show.

19:42.121 --> 19:44.488
A waiter at Joe K's Deli in Vernon

19:44.588 --> 19:48.021
received a $10,000 tip on Friday night

19:48.121 --> 19:51.655
from Michael Richards who
played Kramer on "Seinfeld."

19:51.755 --> 19:53.288
Customers took some photos there.

19:53.455 --> 19:55.088
Claimed the waiter was so happy

19:55.188 --> 19:56.988
they thought he was actually gonna cry.

19:57.088 --> 20:00.488
While the story is not
verified, the customers insist

20:00.588 --> 20:02.621
it was Cosmo Kramer himself

20:02.721 --> 20:05.688
- who left that very generous tip.
- I love it.

20:05.788 --> 20:08.555
I had delivered on my
promise to put Joe K's Deli

20:08.655 --> 20:10.821
back in the spotlight
and when I returned

20:10.921 --> 20:13.621
the next day, Steve
couldn't have been happier.

20:13.721 --> 20:15.988
You came like an angel and, uh...

20:16.088 --> 20:17.521
An angel? Really?

20:17.621 --> 20:19.355
Angel, yes.

20:19.455 --> 20:21.321
And with all the press
coverage they got,

20:21.421 --> 20:23.755
I was sure business would
be booming for a while.

20:23.855 --> 20:27.521
"Seinfeld" Michael
Richards leave $10,000 tip.

20:27.621 --> 20:29.388
- Yeah.
- Perfect.

20:29.488 --> 20:31.355
I can't make it out. What's that?

20:31.455 --> 20:33.288
"The Diarrhea"?

20:33.388 --> 20:35.621
I had decided to keep
"The Diarrhea Times" open

20:35.721 --> 20:38.221
for one final issue
so that Austin's work

20:38.321 --> 20:41.055
could be displayed proudly
in a place of honor.

20:41.155 --> 20:43.788
But it still wasn't
easy to say good-bye.

20:43.888 --> 20:47.621
Well, I had a lot of fun here.

20:47.721 --> 20:49.488
Well, maybe we could, like...

20:49.588 --> 20:51.955
get a beer sometime or something.

20:52.055 --> 20:53.788
Or a tea.

20:53.888 --> 20:55.888
Mm, that'd be cool.

20:55.988 --> 20:57.721
- All right, see ya around.
- All right.

20:57.821 --> 21:00.288
- Pleasure working with you.
- Yeah.

21:00.455 --> 21:01.621
- All right.
- Okay, bye, Austin.

21:01.721 --> 21:02.955
Bye.

21:06.921 --> 21:07.888
*

21:07.988 --> 21:12.021
Absolutely.

21:13.921 --> 21:16.321
Smokin'.

21:16.455 --> 21:19.355
Somebody stop me!

21:19.455 --> 21:21.021
Hold on, sugar,

21:21.121 --> 21:24.455
daddy's got a sweet tooth tonight!

21:26.031 --> 21:27.086
Great.
