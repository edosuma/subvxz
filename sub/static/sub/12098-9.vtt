01:25.151 --> 01:26.151
Billy...

01:26.152 --> 01:27.152
Hi, Ma.

01:27.153 --> 01:30.155
Billy, it's after 11:00.

01:30.156 --> 01:31.156
Where have you been?

01:31.157 --> 01:32.658
Uh, I was out, studying.

01:32.659 --> 01:33.659
Again?

01:33.660 --> 01:35.160
You know, for years,

01:35.161 --> 01:36.161
you were always saying to me,

01:36.162 --> 01:37.162
"You never study."

01:37.163 --> 01:38.664
Now I study,
you say I shouldn't.

01:38.665 --> 01:41.166
I'm not saying you shouldn't,
but you study all the time,

01:41.167 --> 01:42.668
and I want you to have fun.

01:42.669 --> 01:46.672
I'm having fun, Ma.
I promise you, I'm having fun.

01:46.673 --> 01:48.674
Okay...

01:48.675 --> 01:50.175
but I've also noticed

01:50.176 --> 01:53.178
that you're not eating
very much lately.

01:53.179 --> 01:55.180
Is something
bothering you, honey?

01:55.181 --> 01:59.184
No, of course not.
Don't be silly.

01:59.185 --> 02:00.185
Yeah.

02:00.186 --> 02:03.689
What?

02:03.690 --> 02:05.691
Well, you see, my friend, Bobby,

02:05.692 --> 02:06.692
he's having some problems,

02:06.693 --> 02:08.193
and I'm a little worried
about him.

02:08.193 --> 02:10.195
You're a good friend, Billy.

02:10.196 --> 02:11.697
Yeah, well, you know...

02:11.698 --> 02:13.198
What is his problem?

02:13.199 --> 02:15.701
He's in love
with one of his teachers.

02:15.702 --> 02:18.203
Oh, that's normal.

02:18.204 --> 02:21.206
Everyone at one time or another
gets a crush on a teacher.

02:21.207 --> 02:26.211
I had a terrible crush
on Mr. McGee.

02:26.212 --> 02:29.715
No, it's not a crush, Ma.
They're dating.

02:29.716 --> 02:32.718
I wonder
if I'd dated Mr. McGee

02:32.719 --> 02:36.221
if I would've passed algebra.

02:36.222 --> 02:38.223
Oh, well.
What difference does it make?

02:38.224 --> 02:39.224
Algebra.

02:39.225 --> 02:41.727
I have never once
in all these years

02:41.728 --> 02:44.731
had to find "X."

02:47.734 --> 02:51.236
So, your friend Bobby
and his teacher are dating?

02:51.237 --> 02:54.239
Yeah, and he's really worried
about it.

02:54.240 --> 02:56.241
I mean, one,
because she's his teacher,

02:56.242 --> 02:57.242
and two, she's an older woman.

02:57.243 --> 02:59.244
He's really in love with her.

02:59.245 --> 03:01.246
She's incredible.

03:01.247 --> 03:03.749
She's beautiful, and bright,

03:03.750 --> 03:05.751
sensitive, and fun.

03:05.752 --> 03:08.253
From what Joe says.

03:08.254 --> 03:11.256
Who's Joe?

03:11.257 --> 03:12.758
My friend.

03:12.759 --> 03:14.760
I thought you said
his name was Bobby.

03:14.761 --> 03:17.763
It is. It's Bobby-Joe.

03:17.764 --> 03:19.264
He's Southern.

03:19.265 --> 03:21.266
Uh, he's got a brother
Billy-Joe, a brother Benny-Joe,

03:21.267 --> 03:24.269
a father, Bonnie-Joe
and a mother, Millie-Joe.

03:24.270 --> 03:26.271
I see.

03:26.272 --> 03:30.776
Well, these relationships
really often work out.

03:30.777 --> 03:32.277
You know, take for instance

03:32.278 --> 03:33.779
Burt Reynolds and Dinah Shore.

03:33.780 --> 03:37.282
Now, she's much older
than he is,

03:37.283 --> 03:39.284
and they went together
for years.

03:39.285 --> 03:41.787
Of course, he is with
that little nun now.

03:45.792 --> 03:47.292
It all worked out.

03:47.293 --> 03:49.294
I mean, nobody
seemed to get hurt.

03:49.295 --> 03:50.295
See, I saw Dinah this afternoon

03:50.296 --> 03:51.797
on her show.

03:51.798 --> 03:55.801
She was happy, smiling.

03:55.802 --> 03:57.302
So it can work out?

03:57.303 --> 03:58.804
Oh, absolutely.

03:58.805 --> 03:59.805
Even your cousin, Cynthia.

03:59.806 --> 04:02.307
She was married to someone
much older too

04:02.308 --> 04:03.809
in her first marriage.

04:03.810 --> 04:08.313
She was 22 and he was 76.

04:08.314 --> 04:09.314
Well, it didn't last long.

04:09.315 --> 04:11.317
He died on the honeymoon.

04:12.318 --> 04:14.820
But these relationships
can work out.

04:14.821 --> 04:16.822
Oh, boy, that's a relief.

04:16.822 --> 04:18.324
James'll be so happy.

04:19.826 --> 04:21.326
Who's James?

04:21.327 --> 04:22.327
My friend.

04:22.328 --> 04:24.830
I thought you said
his name was Bobby-Joe.

04:24.831 --> 04:28.333
Bobby-Joe James.

04:28.334 --> 04:30.836
Uh, country and western singer.

04:30.837 --> 04:32.338
You never heard
of Bobby-Joe James?

04:37.844 --> 04:39.344
It's you, isn't it?

04:39.345 --> 04:40.846
I guess.

04:40.847 --> 04:43.849
You and your teacher?

04:43.850 --> 04:45.350
Yes.

04:45.351 --> 04:50.856
Good God,
how could she do such a thing?

04:50.857 --> 04:53.358
I mean, how sick,

04:53.359 --> 04:55.360
to get involved
with a mere child

04:55.361 --> 04:59.364
when she's, what,
probably 55, 68 years old?

04:59.365 --> 05:00.866
I mean, how shocking, how sick...

05:00.867 --> 05:01.867
She's not 68.

05:01.868 --> 05:03.869
What makes you think she's 68?

05:03.870 --> 05:04.870
You said she was older.

05:04.871 --> 05:06.371
68 is older.

05:06.372 --> 05:07.372
She's 27.

05:07.373 --> 05:09.374
27!

05:09.375 --> 05:12.377
Oh, God, Billy.

05:12.378 --> 05:14.880
27 years old.

05:14.881 --> 05:17.382
Mom, just 20 seconds ago,
you said it was okay.

05:17.383 --> 05:18.884
You remember Burt Reynolds,
Dinah Shore?

05:18.885 --> 05:21.386
Well, we don't know
how they feel.

05:21.387 --> 05:23.388
I mean, you cannot take
Rona Barrett's word

05:23.389 --> 05:25.390
for everything, you know.

05:25.391 --> 05:28.393
You said
Dinah looked fine, happy.

05:28.394 --> 05:30.395
Lighting.

05:30.396 --> 05:34.900
It's just that
you're still such a little baby.

05:34.901 --> 05:36.401
I'm not a baby, Mom.

05:36.402 --> 05:38.403
Just four years ago,

05:38.404 --> 05:40.906
you cried when you struck out
at Little League.

05:40.907 --> 05:42.407
That was a long time ago.

05:42.408 --> 05:44.409
I don't want you to get hurt.

05:44.410 --> 05:45.410
I won't get hurt.

05:45.411 --> 05:47.412
You might get hurt.

05:47.413 --> 05:49.415
If I do get hurt,
it was worth it.

05:50.416 --> 05:52.918
Mom, she's a nice person.

05:52.919 --> 05:56.421
A nice, 27-year-old person
who teaches history.

05:56.422 --> 05:58.924
Well, I guess
I can't object, can I?

05:58.925 --> 06:00.425
I mean, if she's a nice person,

06:00.426 --> 06:01.426
how can I object?

06:01.427 --> 06:04.930
I mean, I'd like to find
a way to object, but...

06:04.931 --> 06:06.932
There's nothing to worry about.

06:06.933 --> 06:08.433
I promise you.

06:08.434 --> 06:09.935
It's okay.

06:09.936 --> 06:11.576
There's absolutely
nothing to worry about.

06:16.943 --> 06:19.444
Well, I guess I'm going

06:19.445 --> 06:21.947
to have to let you grow up, huh?

06:21.948 --> 06:23.448
I will anyway.

06:23.449 --> 06:25.450
I know.

06:25.451 --> 06:28.453
Good night, Mom.

06:28.454 --> 06:29.955
Good night, honey.

06:31.958 --> 06:34.460
Just yesterday, rubber pants.

06:35.962 --> 06:36.963
Ma...

06:43.970 --> 06:46.472
Just yesterday.

06:54.480 --> 06:55.480
Mare!

06:55.481 --> 06:56.982
Mare, where've you been?

06:56.983 --> 06:57.983
I slept at Jessica's.

06:57.984 --> 07:01.486
Oh, Mare, Mare, Mare.

07:01.487 --> 07:03.488
Stop it!

07:03.489 --> 07:04.489
You're always all over me,

07:04.490 --> 07:05.991
pawing me, touching me.

07:05.992 --> 07:07.993
I'm not an avocado.

07:07.994 --> 07:09.995
Wait a minute, Mare.
What's the matter?

07:09.996 --> 07:11.496
Did we meet at the drugstore?

07:11.497 --> 07:13.498
Yes.
And did you disappear?

07:13.499 --> 07:15.000
Yes.

07:15.001 --> 07:16.501
You really disappeared?

07:16.502 --> 07:19.004
I'm not crazy?
You disappeared?

07:19.005 --> 07:21.006
Mare, you're not crazy.
I disappeared.

07:21.007 --> 07:23.008
You can make yourself disappear?

07:23.009 --> 07:24.009
No.

07:24.010 --> 07:25.510
You're making me crazy.

07:25.511 --> 07:27.012
Mary, wait a minute.

07:27.013 --> 07:28.513
Mare, Mare, listen,
I disappeared.

07:28.514 --> 07:30.015
I did. I disappeared,

07:30.016 --> 07:33.018
but I didn't make me disappear.

07:33.019 --> 07:34.520
They made me disappear.

07:35.521 --> 07:37.522
We're both crazy.
No, no.

07:37.523 --> 07:39.524
Mare, listen to me.
Mare, please listen to me.

07:39.525 --> 07:40.525
You've gotta hear this now.

07:40.526 --> 07:42.027
Remember when I went looking

07:42.028 --> 07:43.528
for the spaceship?

07:43.529 --> 07:46.031
I found it.

07:46.032 --> 07:49.034
Mare, I'm telling you,
they beamed me up to their ship.

07:49.035 --> 07:50.535
I was on the ship.

07:50.536 --> 07:52.037
It was an alien spaceship.

07:52.038 --> 07:54.539
You were on an alien spaceship.

07:54.540 --> 07:55.540
That's it.
Right. Yeah.

07:55.541 --> 07:58.543
Look at this.
Look at that.

07:58.544 --> 07:59.544
See?

07:59.545 --> 08:02.047
It's a knob.

08:02.048 --> 08:05.051
Yeah, yeah, from the spaceship.

08:07.053 --> 08:10.055
Here. We were both
on a spaceship.

08:10.056 --> 08:12.557
No, wait a minute, Mare.

08:12.558 --> 08:13.558
Mary, please.

08:13.559 --> 08:14.559
Saul gave it to me.

08:14.560 --> 08:17.562
Saul? An alien named Saul?

08:17.563 --> 08:19.564
Yes. No, no, no.
Saul's not an alien.

08:19.565 --> 08:20.565
He's like you and me.

08:20.566 --> 08:22.067
They captured him
like they captured me,

08:22.068 --> 08:24.569
only they captured him
4,000 years ago.

08:24.570 --> 08:27.072
They've probably stopped
looking for him by now.

08:27.073 --> 08:28.573
Mary, please, listen.

08:28.574 --> 08:30.075
That's what they do.
They capture people.

08:30.076 --> 08:31.576
Then, in order
to study the Earth,

08:31.577 --> 08:34.578
they send down a duplicate
of the guy they captured.

08:34.580 --> 08:36.081
See, they took an alien,

08:36.082 --> 08:37.082
a little guy...

08:37.082 --> 08:38.082
they're all little guys,

08:38.083 --> 08:40.585
it's like munchkins
all around you...

08:40.586 --> 08:43.087
and they put him into
an exact duplicate of my body.

08:43.089 --> 08:45.090
Mary, they can do
that stuff. Really.

08:45.091 --> 08:47.092
In this case, unfortunately,

08:47.093 --> 08:48.593
they sent down
this little sex-crazy guy...

08:48.594 --> 08:50.595
Sex-crazy?

08:50.596 --> 08:53.098
Yeah, it seems he hadn't had sex
in 2,000 years.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.601
I mean, 2,000 years, Mary.

08:56.602 --> 08:59.604
I get crazy after a week.

08:59.605 --> 09:01.106
Mare, I'm the Real Burt.

09:01.107 --> 09:02.107
I'm the Real Burt!

09:02.108 --> 09:04.109
You stick a pin in me,
you get blood.

09:04.110 --> 09:06.611
You stick a pin in him,
you get Freon.

09:06.612 --> 09:10.615
Burt, it's true.

09:10.616 --> 09:12.617
Sex-crazy. It wasn't you.

09:12.618 --> 09:14.119
That's what I'm telling you.

09:14.120 --> 09:15.120
You're you!

09:15.121 --> 09:16.621
I'm me. He's him.

09:16.622 --> 09:17.622
I'm not him. I'm me.

09:17.623 --> 09:19.124
Where is he?

09:19.125 --> 09:21.126
I... Well, they beamed him
up to the ship.

09:21.127 --> 09:22.627
He's up there
in his little silver body,

09:22.628 --> 09:23.628
diddling around.

09:23.629 --> 09:27.632
Burt, I'm not crazy.

09:27.633 --> 09:29.134
I'm really not crazy.

09:29.135 --> 09:32.137
I thought I was crazy,
but I am not crazy.

09:32.138 --> 09:34.139
Oh! Oh, thank God.

09:34.140 --> 09:36.641
I'd go crazy if I was crazy.

09:36.642 --> 09:38.143
Oh, Burt.

09:38.144 --> 09:39.645
Welcome home.

09:42.648 --> 09:44.649
It must have been terrible
up there.

09:44.650 --> 09:47.152
No. Well, you know, actually,
they were pretty nice to me,

09:47.153 --> 09:49.654
but the terrible part
was not being with you.

09:49.655 --> 09:52.157
That was the terrible part.

09:52.158 --> 09:56.662
That and the teeny little
portions they serve up there.

09:58.664 --> 10:01.667
I am so happy that you're home.

10:03.669 --> 10:05.670
Wait. Hey, Mare, wait.

10:05.671 --> 10:07.672
Mare, when you came in,
you said I...

10:07.673 --> 10:09.174
I couldn't keep
my hands off you.

10:09.175 --> 10:11.176
Did, uh, did he, uh...

10:11.177 --> 10:13.678
Nothing.

10:13.679 --> 10:15.680
Really.

10:15.681 --> 10:17.683
Tapped me on the shoulder a lot.

10:19.906 --> 10:21.186
Wait a minute, Mary, please now.

10:21.187 --> 10:22.687
He was a very horny little guy.

10:22.688 --> 10:24.689
Really?

10:24.690 --> 10:28.193
Yeah, Mare, come on, just...
Tell me. I mean...

10:28.194 --> 10:30.696
You know, did any...
You know, you and...

10:32.698 --> 10:35.701
Well, Burt,
I thought it was you.

10:37.203 --> 10:38.703
While I was up there with them,

10:38.704 --> 10:40.205
you were up there with him?

10:40.206 --> 10:43.209
I didn't know it was him.
I thought it was you.

10:46.712 --> 10:48.213
So how was I?

10:50.716 --> 10:54.719
Unbelievably... bad. Bad.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.721
Bad?

10:56.722 --> 10:57.722
Huh!

10:57.723 --> 10:59.224
How come?

10:59.225 --> 11:02.228
It just wasn't you.

11:16.242 --> 11:19.744
So, I thought it would help
if I found the kidnappers.

11:19.745 --> 11:21.246
I thought
it would make me feel better,

11:21.247 --> 11:24.249
but it turns out it didn't.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.251
I mean,
it didn't bring you back.

11:26.252 --> 11:29.754
God, I miss you so much, Elaine.

11:29.755 --> 11:33.258
I never knew what it was like
to miss somebody until now.

11:35.261 --> 11:38.264
I'll come again soon.

11:40.266 --> 11:42.767
I love you, Elaine.

11:42.768 --> 11:44.269
Bye-bye.

11:47.273 --> 11:48.773
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:48.774 --> 11:50.275
I really didn't mean...

11:50.276 --> 11:51.776
but I was, I was just...

11:51.777 --> 11:52.777
I'm sorry.

11:54.280 --> 11:55.280
It's okay.

11:55.281 --> 11:57.283
You look so sad.

11:59.785 --> 12:02.287
Well, I-I mean,
of course, you look sad.

12:02.288 --> 12:03.788
You're here.
It's... It's natural.

12:03.789 --> 12:07.792
It's just that I...

12:07.793 --> 12:09.294
Never mind.

12:09.295 --> 12:10.795
I'm, uh, I'm really sorry.

12:10.796 --> 12:11.796
Goodbye.

12:11.797 --> 12:12.797
Thank you.

12:12.798 --> 12:14.299
You're welcome.
For what?

12:14.300 --> 12:15.800
For caring.

12:15.801 --> 12:17.802
I know what it's like.

12:17.803 --> 12:19.304
Is that...

12:19.305 --> 12:20.305
My husband.

12:20.306 --> 12:21.306
I'm sorry.

12:21.307 --> 12:22.307
You?

12:22.308 --> 12:23.308
Wife.
When?

12:23.309 --> 12:24.809
A few months ago. You?

12:24.810 --> 12:25.810
Six months.

12:25.811 --> 12:29.314
You know, I used to think
it was crazy

12:29.315 --> 12:31.316
whenever you'd see
in a movie or something,

12:31.317 --> 12:34.319
somebody talking
to somebody who was...

12:34.320 --> 12:35.820
you know...

12:35.821 --> 12:36.821
Dead.

12:36.822 --> 12:38.823
Yeah, dead.

12:38.824 --> 12:40.325
I hate to say that word.

12:40.326 --> 12:42.827
I figure, if I don't say it,
it won't be true.

12:42.828 --> 12:44.829
Yeah, I know.

12:44.830 --> 12:47.832
I used to think
it was crazy, talking, but...

12:47.833 --> 12:49.834
now I come here
and talk to Elaine.

12:49.835 --> 12:51.336
I do too.

12:51.337 --> 12:53.339
You knew Elaine?

12:55.341 --> 12:59.344
No, my husband?
I talk to my husband.

12:59.345 --> 13:02.347
Oh! Right. Sure.

13:02.348 --> 13:04.349
It helps too, you know.

13:04.350 --> 13:06.851
I don't feel so alone.

13:06.852 --> 13:08.853
I just wish they could answer.

13:08.854 --> 13:10.855
Yeah, I know.

13:10.856 --> 13:14.859
You know, sometimes
when I wake up in the morning,

13:14.860 --> 13:18.363
for a second, I don't remember
that it happened,

13:18.364 --> 13:22.367
and then it hits me,
just like it did the first time.

13:22.368 --> 13:23.868
Yeah.

13:23.869 --> 13:24.870
I know.

13:29.875 --> 13:34.379
Listen, you wanna have
a cup of coffee or something?

13:34.380 --> 13:35.380
Now?

13:35.381 --> 13:36.381
Yeah.

13:36.382 --> 13:37.382
I don't know.

13:37.383 --> 13:38.883
Oh, forget it.

13:38.884 --> 13:40.385
It's probably not a good idea.

13:40.386 --> 13:42.887
I mean, I think
I'd feel a little funny

13:42.888 --> 13:44.389
enjoying myself now, you know?

13:44.390 --> 13:45.891
Me too.

13:56.902 --> 13:58.904
Wait a minute.

14:11.417 --> 14:12.917
She says it's fine.

14:12.918 --> 14:14.419
She does?

14:14.420 --> 14:15.421
Yeah.

14:24.430 --> 14:25.930
He says it's all right too.

14:25.931 --> 14:27.432
Then what do you say?

14:27.433 --> 14:29.934
I'm Polly.

14:29.935 --> 14:31.436
Let's have coffee.

14:31.437 --> 14:32.437
I'm Danny.

14:32.438 --> 14:33.439
Let's go.

14:47.953 --> 14:50.455
You mean, that you actually
lied to Dutch?

14:50.456 --> 14:51.956
What was I gonna do,

14:51.957 --> 14:53.458
tell him Eunice was there
with a guy?

14:53.459 --> 14:54.459
The man is a killer.

14:54.460 --> 14:55.960
Could you two knock it off?

14:55.961 --> 14:58.463
He is making breakfast
in the next room.

14:58.464 --> 15:00.965
You lied to a killer?
Are you crazy?

15:00.966 --> 15:02.967
I was saving my sister's behind.

15:02.968 --> 15:05.970
My behind does not need saving.

15:05.971 --> 15:07.972
Eunice, I don't understand you.

15:07.973 --> 15:09.474
How could you do this to him?

15:09.475 --> 15:11.476
Oh, I don't know.

15:11.477 --> 15:14.979
Sometimes, I love him,
and sometimes, I don't.

15:14.980 --> 15:17.982
I take it last night
was a definite don't.

15:17.983 --> 15:19.484
Oh, listen to this.

15:19.485 --> 15:22.487
I'm getting snide remarks
from a hot Cub Scout.

15:22.488 --> 15:25.490
Eunice, what if he finds out?

15:25.491 --> 15:27.492
That dolt?
How could he?

15:27.493 --> 15:29.494
Eunice, don't you think
it might be fair to Dutch

15:29.495 --> 15:30.495
to tell him how you feel?

15:30.496 --> 15:32.497
Oh, I don't know.

15:32.498 --> 15:36.000
He does certain things
very well.

15:36.001 --> 15:38.503
Oh, Eunice...

15:38.504 --> 15:40.505
Good morning.

15:40.506 --> 15:41.506
Good morning, Daddy.

15:41.507 --> 15:42.507
Eh?

15:42.508 --> 15:43.508
Everyone sleep well?

15:43.509 --> 15:44.509
Oh, yeah.

15:44.510 --> 15:46.512
Eventually.

15:48.013 --> 15:50.515
It's so nice to hear
my children's voices

15:50.516 --> 15:52.016
chattering away,

15:52.017 --> 15:54.019
and to see
their happy, little faces.

15:57.523 --> 16:00.024
Good morning, Billy.

16:00.025 --> 16:02.026
Did you have
an interesting time last night?

16:02.027 --> 16:05.530
Oh, uh, same old thing.

16:07.533 --> 16:09.033
Really?

16:09.034 --> 16:11.035
Good morning.

16:11.036 --> 16:12.537
Good morning, Dutch.

16:12.538 --> 16:13.538
Everybody ready for breakfast?

16:13.539 --> 16:14.539
Smells wonderful.

16:14.540 --> 16:16.541
Leavenworth porridge.

16:16.542 --> 16:18.042
Actually, only one
other guy besides me

16:18.043 --> 16:19.544
has the recipe for this,

16:19.545 --> 16:21.045
and he doesn't have
much use for it anymore.

16:21.046 --> 16:22.046
Oh, why not?

16:22.047 --> 16:23.548
They executed him.

16:23.549 --> 16:27.553
Well, it's nice
he wrote it down.

16:29.054 --> 16:30.555
For the lady of the house.

16:30.556 --> 16:32.056
Oh, thank you, Dutch.

16:32.057 --> 16:34.559
I'm so happy
to see everyone this morning.

16:34.560 --> 16:37.562
This house was like
a morgue last night.

16:37.563 --> 16:39.564
I mean, Billy didn't
come home from school,

16:39.565 --> 16:42.066
and Chester didn't come
home from the city.

16:42.067 --> 16:45.069
Eunice didn't come home
from the movies,

16:45.070 --> 16:49.073
and Corrine didn't come home.

16:49.074 --> 16:52.076
Dutch was in and out
all night long,

16:52.077 --> 16:54.078
but he never sat down to chat.

16:54.079 --> 16:57.081
I'm just glad that it's morning
so I can have a little company.

16:57.082 --> 16:59.083
For the master of the house.

16:59.084 --> 17:02.587
Well, thank you, Dutch.

17:02.588 --> 17:04.088
Enjoy, all.
There's plenty.

17:04.089 --> 17:06.089
Oh, Dutch?

17:06.090 --> 17:07.592
Yes, my sweet?

17:07.593 --> 17:08.593
What about me, don't I get any?

17:08.594 --> 17:10.595
Oh, of course, my dear.

17:10.596 --> 17:13.097
How stupid of me.

17:18.604 --> 17:20.104
Princess!

17:20.105 --> 17:23.608
I can be such a dolt sometimes.

17:23.608 --> 17:27.612
You stupid clod!
How dare you?

17:27.613 --> 17:28.613
Dolt, eh?

17:28.614 --> 17:30.114
You spent the night
with some clown,

17:30.115 --> 17:32.116
and I'm too stupid
to figure it out?

17:32.117 --> 17:36.621
Clowns! Oh!
They're my favorite thing.

17:36.622 --> 17:39.625
You horrible,
loathsome, malicious...

17:44.630 --> 17:47.131
Dutch, I just
don't believe this!

17:47.132 --> 17:48.132
<i>You</i> don't believe it?

17:48.133 --> 17:49.133
No.

17:49.134 --> 17:50.134
<i>You</i> don't?

17:50.135 --> 17:51.636
I turned state's evidence
for you.

17:51.637 --> 17:54.639
I fink on my own kind,
and <i>you</i> don't believe it?

17:54.640 --> 17:56.140
<i>You</i> don't?

17:56.141 --> 17:58.643
Well, wait till you see
what I got planned for lunch.

17:58.644 --> 18:02.146
Settle down!

18:02.147 --> 18:03.648
I love you, Eunice.

18:03.649 --> 18:07.653
Oh, Dutch, flowers would've been
so much nicer.

18:10.155 --> 18:13.157
Eunice, if that
ever happens again,

18:13.158 --> 18:15.660
it'll be the sorriest night
of your life.

18:18.163 --> 18:23.167
Oh, men are such
temperamental cooks.

18:23.168 --> 18:26.170
Is he gone, Jessica?

18:26.171 --> 18:27.672
Yes, Chester.

18:27.673 --> 18:34.178
Colonel, that helmet
is way too big.

18:34.179 --> 18:36.681
Now, you get one your own size.

18:36.682 --> 18:37.682
Oh, Major.

18:37.683 --> 18:40.686
And clean up this mess now!

18:42.187 --> 18:45.690
Would anyone
care for more coffee?

18:45.691 --> 18:48.694
CHESTER:
I think I'd like some.

18:58.704 --> 18:59.704
Mary...

18:59.705 --> 19:01.205
Hi, Jess.

19:01.206 --> 19:02.707
Hello, darling.

19:02.708 --> 19:04.709
Oh, Mary, I'm so sorry I'm late,

19:04.710 --> 19:07.211
but I simply could not
get out of <i>Bloomingdale's.</i>

19:07.212 --> 19:08.212
I love that store.

19:08.213 --> 19:09.714
Me too.

19:09.715 --> 19:13.217
I think I'd like
to be buried there.

19:13.218 --> 19:16.721
So, Mary, what is
your wonderful news?

19:16.722 --> 19:18.222
Jessica, you know

19:18.223 --> 19:19.724
how I've been thinking
I'm crazy,

19:19.725 --> 19:22.226
because I've thought
Burt wasn't Burt?

19:22.227 --> 19:23.227
Uh-huh.

19:23.228 --> 19:26.230
Well, I'm not crazy, Jessica.

19:26.231 --> 19:28.232
I am not crazy at all.

19:28.233 --> 19:30.234
The man I thought wasn't Burt
wasn't Burt.

19:30.235 --> 19:33.238
He was a man from outer space
made to look just like Burt.

19:34.740 --> 19:37.241
Of course, I knew, you see,

19:37.242 --> 19:40.244
that even though he was Burt,
he wasn't.

19:49.755 --> 19:52.757
I see.

19:52.758 --> 19:55.259
Now, Mary,
did Burt tell you this,

19:55.260 --> 19:58.262
or did you just
draw your own conclusions?

19:58.263 --> 19:59.764
He told me.

19:59.765 --> 20:02.266
Not the Alien Burt.
The Real Burt told me,

20:02.267 --> 20:04.268
once he got rid
of the Alien Burt.

20:04.269 --> 20:06.270
I see.

20:06.271 --> 20:08.773
Well, if it makes you
happy, Mary,

20:08.774 --> 20:12.276
that's all that's important.

20:12.277 --> 20:14.278
But it's true, Jess, it's true.

20:14.279 --> 20:17.281
Listen, it's all right.
Whatever works for you.

20:19.785 --> 20:21.786
Ask Burt.
He'll explain it to you.

20:21.787 --> 20:22.787
Oh, I will, I will.

20:22.788 --> 20:24.288
I'll come over some night,

20:24.289 --> 20:27.291
and we can all sit around
and have a few laughs about it,

20:27.292 --> 20:28.292
but not now, Mary.

20:28.293 --> 20:30.795
I've got too much on my mind.

20:30.796 --> 20:31.796
That's why I went shopping.

20:31.797 --> 20:33.297
When I get upset, I go shopping,

20:33.298 --> 20:35.299
because then I can get upset
about what I bought,

20:35.300 --> 20:37.802
and I forget what I got
upset about in the first place.

20:37.803 --> 20:38.803
Only today,

20:38.804 --> 20:44.308
I couldn't find anything
that upset me in my size.

20:44.309 --> 20:46.811
Jessica, what's wrong?

20:46.812 --> 20:49.313
Billy is in love
with one of his teachers.

20:49.314 --> 20:50.815
That's normal.

20:50.816 --> 20:52.316
He's dating her.

20:52.317 --> 20:54.318
That's not.

20:54.319 --> 20:55.820
Mary, next week

20:55.821 --> 20:57.822
are the parent-
teachers' conferences.

20:57.823 --> 21:00.825
I mean, what am I
going to talk about?

21:00.826 --> 21:03.828
How Billy's doing?

21:03.829 --> 21:06.831
I mean, I don't think
I want to know.

21:06.832 --> 21:08.833
Dating his teacher...

21:08.834 --> 21:12.336
He'll never know
what he's being graded for.

21:12.337 --> 21:15.840
And Mary, she is 10 years
older than he is.

21:15.841 --> 21:18.342
Now, I know 10 years
shouldn't bother me,

21:18.343 --> 21:20.344
and I can't think
of a reason in the world

21:20.345 --> 21:21.345
why it does bother me.

21:21.346 --> 21:22.847
All I know
is that it bothers me.

21:22.848 --> 21:24.849
If she was a man,
it wouldn't bother you.

21:24.850 --> 21:31.355
No, Mary, I think
that would bother me more.

21:31.356 --> 21:32.857
Because, you see, Mary,

21:32.858 --> 21:36.861
then Billy would be dating
an older, homosexual teacher.

21:36.862 --> 21:39.363
No, Jessica.

21:39.364 --> 21:42.867
I mean, if Billy was a girl,
and the teacher was a man.

21:42.868 --> 21:43.868
We think nothing

21:43.869 --> 21:45.870
of a man being 10 years
older than a woman.

21:45.871 --> 21:47.873
That's because
they generally are.

21:50.876 --> 21:51.876
What?

21:51.877 --> 21:54.378
Men are generally
older than women.

21:54.379 --> 21:56.881
Jessica, what I mean is...

21:56.882 --> 21:58.383
Mary, look!

21:59.885 --> 22:01.886
What?

22:01.887 --> 22:05.389
It's Chester. Are you sure?

22:05.390 --> 22:06.390
With a woman!

22:06.391 --> 22:07.892
It was Chester with a woman.

22:07.893 --> 22:08.893
Jessica...

22:08.894 --> 22:11.896
that was probably Chester
getting into the elevator,

22:11.897 --> 22:13.899
and a woman
getting into the elevator.

22:14.900 --> 22:16.901
He was holding her arm.

22:16.902 --> 22:20.404
Maybe she was blind.

22:20.405 --> 22:23.908
No, she was a brunette.

22:27.913 --> 22:31.415
Mary, he has gone upstairs
with her.

22:31.416 --> 22:33.918
Jessica,
don't jump to conclusions.

22:33.919 --> 22:37.421
There are a million reasons
why he could be here.

22:37.422 --> 22:38.422
Name one.

22:38.423 --> 22:41.425
Smoke Enders.

22:41.426 --> 22:43.427
Smoke Enders meets upstairs.

22:43.428 --> 22:44.428
He doesn't smoke.

22:44.429 --> 22:46.430
EST.

22:46.431 --> 22:47.431
What?

22:47.432 --> 22:48.933
EST.

22:48.934 --> 22:53.437
You know that group.
The McDonald's of psychiatry.

22:53.438 --> 22:56.941
Chester hates hamburgers.

22:58.944 --> 23:00.444
Where are you going?

23:00.445 --> 23:01.445
Upstairs.

23:01.446 --> 23:03.447
Jess, please don't go.

23:03.448 --> 23:07.952
Mary, it's the only way
that I'm going to know for sure,

23:07.953 --> 23:09.454
and I've got to know.

23:28.895 --> 23:30.975
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Will anything happen with Danny and Polly?</i>

23:30.976 --> 23:33.477
<i>Will they decide to meet</i>
<i>somewhere else next time?</i>

23:33.478 --> 23:34.979
<i>What will Jessica find</i>

23:34.980 --> 23:36.480
<i>when she goes up</i>
<i>to Chester's room?</i>

23:36.481 --> 23:38.983
<i>Will a "Do Not Disturb"</i>
<i>sign stop her?</i>

23:38.984 --> 23:40.985
<i>Is Mary glad Real Burt is back?</i>

23:40.986 --> 23:42.987
<i>Won't there be certain things</i>
<i>she'll miss?</i>

23:42.988 --> 23:45.489
<i>Will Eunice find out</i>
<i>what's for breakfast</i>

23:45.490 --> 23:46.490
<i>before she fools around again?</i>

23:46.491 --> 23:47.992
<i>Will she at least wear a hat?</i>

23:47.993 --> 23:49.493
<i>These questions and many others</i>
<i>will be answered</i>

23:49.494 --> 23:53.498
<i>on the next episode of</i> Soap.

23:58.503 --> 24:01.506
