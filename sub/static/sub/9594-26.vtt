WEBVTT

00:31.765 --> 00:33.634
Ugh!

00:33.667 --> 00:37.505
What is this horrible odor?

00:37.538 --> 00:40.141
I don't smell anything.

00:40.174 --> 00:42.676
Don't smell it? I can see it!

00:42.710 --> 00:44.678
It's thick enough
to cut through!

00:47.548 --> 00:49.183
It's really not that bad.

00:49.217 --> 00:51.352
We're not going down
without a fight.

00:51.385 --> 00:52.386
Titans, go!

01:00.728 --> 01:02.696
I don't smell it.

01:13.907 --> 01:16.610
Finally!

01:16.644 --> 01:18.446
Relief!

01:18.479 --> 01:22.250
This is indeed preferable
to breathing that
into my nose.

01:22.283 --> 01:25.353
I refuse to be killed
by a malicious odor.

01:25.386 --> 01:27.588
We are going to live!

01:27.621 --> 01:29.590
Do we have to?

01:29.623 --> 01:30.658
Yes! Yeah!

01:30.691 --> 01:32.593
-Resurrection punch!
-Ah!

01:32.626 --> 01:34.428
Kick of life!

01:34.462 --> 01:37.365
Spirit slam!

01:37.398 --> 01:40.601
Huh, I thought you were
really dead forever this time.

01:40.634 --> 01:44.538
Why is not Beast Boy affected
by this noxious aroma.

01:45.773 --> 01:48.776
Because the smell is coming
from his room.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.286
Son, that's disgusting.

01:58.319 --> 02:00.721
Someone could get lost
in this mess.

02:00.754 --> 02:03.424
This place
is a pigsty, Beast Boy.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.793
Well, where else are the pigs
supposed to go?

02:07.261 --> 02:08.762
Oh! Piggies!

02:08.796 --> 02:11.565
Piggie, piggie,
piggie, pigs.

02:13.534 --> 02:16.504
It may look messy, but I know
where everything is.

02:16.537 --> 02:19.507
That's the garbage tree
where the possums live.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.875
That's where I keep
my mold collection.

02:21.909 --> 02:24.745
And that's Sticky Joe.
Hey, Sticky Joe.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.448
Howdy!

02:28.816 --> 02:30.384
Unacceptable, Beast Boy!

02:30.418 --> 02:32.786
ROBIN: Garbage trees,
mold, Sticky Joe?

02:32.820 --> 02:33.921
Howdy.

02:33.954 --> 02:35.489
This is no way to live.

02:35.523 --> 02:37.925
You are way too comfortable
in this mess.

02:37.958 --> 02:40.394
Why do you
not discard the garbage?

02:40.428 --> 02:43.664
Garbage? You're talking about
my favorite pile of dirt!

02:46.967 --> 02:49.803
Each stain, each sticky lump
in this room

02:49.837 --> 02:51.805
is a memory
to be cherished.

02:51.839 --> 02:54.542
As your best bro,
I have to tell you...

02:54.575 --> 02:56.744
You need help.

02:58.379 --> 02:59.347
Maybe I do.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.549
But no one has ever taught me
how to clean!

03:01.582 --> 03:04.518
While we deal with this,
Raven can help you.

03:04.552 --> 03:05.719
Sweet.

03:05.753 --> 03:07.255
I'll try it then.

03:07.288 --> 03:09.390
Please don't throw away
my scab collection.

03:14.462 --> 03:16.264
Understood, Beast Boy.

03:21.302 --> 03:23.537
Begin with the scabs.

03:26.740 --> 03:27.975
Let's start simple.

03:28.008 --> 03:30.678
Here's some garbage,
here's a trashcan.

03:30.711 --> 03:31.945
What do you do?

03:31.979 --> 03:34.982
No problem, mama!
Easy-peasy!

03:38.786 --> 03:40.454
No!

03:40.488 --> 03:41.355
What am I doing?

03:41.389 --> 03:43.591
That was a perfectly good
banana peel.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.860
There you are!

03:46.894 --> 03:49.730
Hey! Who threw away
this greasy napkin?

03:49.763 --> 03:50.964
Oh, man!

03:50.998 --> 03:52.900
Look at all this
good stuff in here.

03:59.807 --> 04:02.543
-CYBORG: Shoo! Scat!

04:04.812 --> 04:06.747
The garbage, the garbage,

04:06.780 --> 04:09.550
the garbage, and the garbage.

04:13.921 --> 04:16.957
Okay, you can only keep
one of these items.

04:18.926 --> 04:19.927
Which one is it?

04:19.960 --> 04:21.829
Oh, this one is easy.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.731
This... No, this!

04:23.764 --> 04:26.434
Wait, no, this! No...

04:26.467 --> 04:29.370
Wait, they're all so great.

04:30.538 --> 04:33.073
I can't decide!

04:33.106 --> 04:35.776
I can't decide!

04:44.552 --> 04:45.853
Beat it, Sticky Joe!

04:45.886 --> 04:48.322
And don't come back!

04:57.598 --> 04:59.467
You are a trash magnet!

04:59.500 --> 05:01.935
Where did you learn
it was okay to live
in garbage?

05:01.969 --> 05:03.571
From my hero!

05:03.604 --> 05:06.640
Another cool green dude
who liked to break the rules.

05:06.674 --> 05:10.578
Now remember, kids,
always be filthy.

05:10.611 --> 05:13.547
-Love your garbage
and it will love you back!

05:13.581 --> 05:17.951
Now, let's sing
The Dookie in a Jar song.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.822
He was the best!

05:21.855 --> 05:24.124
You know what?
I love my mess.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.994
And I'm not gonna let
anyone take it from me!

05:30.130 --> 05:32.666
Stop throwing my stuff away!

05:32.700 --> 05:34.034
I know all you see is junk,

05:34.067 --> 05:36.103
but these are
my most prized possessions.

05:36.136 --> 05:39.507
I love my garbage
and my garbage loves me back!

05:39.540 --> 05:42.843
I'm never cleaning this mess!
Ever!

05:42.876 --> 05:48.115
Beast Boy, if you
don't clean this room,
we will make you.

05:48.148 --> 05:51.519
You're forgetting...
This is my room, bro.

05:53.153 --> 05:55.489
You think we can't
find you under there?

05:58.959 --> 06:00.861
I do not see him anywhere.

06:00.894 --> 06:02.095
Out of the way!

06:04.832 --> 06:07.167
Whoa!

06:07.200 --> 06:09.069
You guys have got to see this.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.606
-Whoa!

06:12.640 --> 06:16.176
CYBORG:
This is a lot of garbage!

06:16.209 --> 06:18.646
How will we find
the Beast Boy in here?

06:18.679 --> 06:20.047
Old fashioned tracking.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.716
We pick up a scent!
Now come on, smell!

06:26.654 --> 06:28.055
Oh!

06:29.122 --> 06:32.526
Ugh, all I smell
is butt and fish!

06:32.560 --> 06:34.194
You're not smelling
hard enough!

06:34.227 --> 06:37.030
Somewhere under
all that butt and fish

06:37.064 --> 06:38.466
is Beast Boy's scent!

06:38.499 --> 06:40.133
Now, smell!

06:42.069 --> 06:44.638
Guys, I found some footprints.

06:44.672 --> 06:48.008
Forget the footprints! Smell!

06:48.041 --> 06:49.743
They lead in this direction.

06:49.777 --> 06:51.912
I think I have something.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.649
Somewhere in between
these notes of rancid milk

06:55.683 --> 06:59.019
and wet dog,
I found his scent... Guys?

07:01.254 --> 07:04.525
I cannot
take this heat.

07:04.558 --> 07:06.760
This is some hot garbage.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.764
Guys, do you feel that?

07:10.798 --> 07:13.133
It's raining.
It's raining!

07:14.234 --> 07:16.570
This feels so good!

07:17.170 --> 07:19.640
Ah! So very refreshing.

07:19.673 --> 07:22.209
-Whoo!

07:22.242 --> 07:25.679
Wait! How is it raining
in Beast Boy's room?

07:25.713 --> 07:28.649
Aren't we under his pile
of sweaty shirts?

07:29.216 --> 07:30.751
ROBIN: No...

07:30.784 --> 07:33.086
It's a sweaty rain!
It's a sweaty rain!

07:37.525 --> 07:39.226
Ugh!
Let me under that umbrella!

07:39.259 --> 07:40.561
Let me under that umbrella!

07:40.594 --> 07:41.829
There is not enough room.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.831
Just do the squeezing in!

07:50.571 --> 07:52.540
We can't track him in here.

07:52.573 --> 07:55.609
-Our only chance is
to clean the room ourselves.

07:55.643 --> 07:56.910
What was that?

07:58.311 --> 08:01.181
I think we're being tracked.

08:01.214 --> 08:03.116
-It's the garbage monster!

08:04.151 --> 08:05.285
Hey, guys!

08:05.318 --> 08:07.120
You've really lost it,
Beast Boy.

08:07.154 --> 08:10.123
Living in this filth
has driven you mad.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.692
You're the crazy ones.

08:11.725 --> 08:14.227
You can't see the beauty
in this mess.

08:16.263 --> 08:18.732
Beauty?
Are you serious?

08:18.766 --> 08:20.300
I want to show you something.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.270
Let me take you all
on a magical carpet ride.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.573
Where did you acquire
the magic carpet?

08:25.606 --> 08:28.008
I told you,
I have everything in here

08:28.041 --> 08:30.010
and you guys
wanna throw it away!

08:30.043 --> 08:31.211
Come on.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.884
Let me show you my world!

08:42.790 --> 08:43.657
Glistening!

08:43.691 --> 08:45.893
-Glimmering.
-Gorgeous!

08:45.926 --> 08:47.895
A great new world!

08:58.038 --> 08:59.940
Now do you understand
why I can't throw
all this away?

08:59.973 --> 09:03.276
No. This is trash
and I'm going to take it out.

09:10.851 --> 09:13.754
Dude! That was a structural
support bearing apple core.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.923
We're going
to be buried alive!

09:15.956 --> 09:17.591
Don't worry, I've got this.

09:17.625 --> 09:21.061
All I need are possums,
socks and Sticky Joe.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.196
Uh, I already threw
that stuff out.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.832
You did what?

09:24.865 --> 09:26.834
Why would you
throw away garbage?

09:28.001 --> 09:29.169
Through that hole!

09:43.851 --> 09:45.085
Howdy!

09:45.118 --> 09:46.954
CHILDREN: Sticky Joe!

09:54.762 --> 09:57.097
I was wrong about you,
Sticky Joe.

09:57.130 --> 09:59.633
I'll never forget you.

09:59.667 --> 10:00.668
Howdy.

10:03.370 --> 10:04.972
BEAST BOY:
Mmm.

10:05.005 --> 10:07.140
Now do you understand
why I keep my room like this?

10:07.174 --> 10:11.244
Garbage isn't just
a bunch of garbage
to be thrown away.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.981
Love your garbage
and it will love you back.

10:14.014 --> 10:17.017
You have enlightened us
on the ways of the filth.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.185
Thank you, Beast Boy.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.853
That's right,
I'm the dirtiest.

10:19.887 --> 10:22.322
Now let's sing
The Dookie in a Jar song.
