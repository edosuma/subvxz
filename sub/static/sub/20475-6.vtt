I was thinking about

02:21.099 --> 02:24.853
Gabe has been amazing, but...

02:25.854 --> 02:28.231
is it weird that all night I just

02:28.315 --> 02:30.484
wanted to be with Reggie?

02:30.567 --> 02:31.693
To comfort him.

02:32.694 --> 02:33.695
Of course.

-What else?

02:35.864 --> 02:37.699
-Okay.

Mm-hmm.

Okay, we're back, y'all.

02:47.793 --> 02:49.002
Hope you didn't go anywhere

02:49.086 --> 02:51.088
because racism sure didn't.

02:51.171 --> 02:54.216
Let's take some calls.
Caller, what's your question?

02:54.299 --> 02:56.760
[man] <i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>but didn't Reggie cause a scene?</i>

02:56.843 --> 02:59.888
<i>Wasn't the officer simply protecting</i>
<i>himself and others at the party?</i>

02:59.971 --> 03:02.891
Yeah, but the punishment
for being a rowdy college student

03:02.974 --> 03:05.811

03:12.901 --> 03:14.778
Sorry, brotha.

03:14.861 --> 03:15.946
Still wrong.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.656
Thanks for calling.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.324
Oh, and don't forget, BSU is hosting

03:19.408 --> 03:21.493

03:38.218 --> 03:39.136

with the dean today.

[Sam sighs]

04:31.480 --> 04:33.982
If cops in the real world
aren't held accountable,

04:34.065 --> 04:35.692
how can we expect a Winchester cop

04:35.776 --> 04:37.360
to suffer anything
but a slap on the wrist?

04:37.444 --> 04:41.698
Exactly. We need to make an example out
of that glorified security guard.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.784
Yo, I want to know who called the cops.

04:43.867 --> 04:45.786
Bring that fool to me right now.

04:45.869 --> 04:47.037
-[man] Yeah.
-[woman] Exactly.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.790
What the fuck were these guys doing
with guns in the first place?

04:49.873 --> 04:51.166
-Yeah.
-Exactly.

04:51.249 --> 04:54.961
Brother Reggie, just know that
our thoughts and prayers are with you--

Thoughts and prayers don't stop bullets,
Pastor Kordell.

04:57.964 --> 04:59.841
We need to run up on the campus pig

04:59.925 --> 05:01.092
and handle this ourselves.

05:01.176 --> 05:02.177
[woman] Fuck him up.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.595
Listen to yourselves.

05:03.678 --> 05:05.263
Running up on a cop?

05:05.347 --> 05:07.265
Calling them pigs?

05:08.266 --> 05:10.143
As soon as you double down
on your blackness,

05:10.227 --> 05:12.562
they will double down on their bullshit.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.606
They pull guns on us.

05:14.689 --> 05:15.899
They shoot us. They kill us.

05:15.982 --> 05:19.277
That has not changed in 200 years.

05:19.361 --> 05:22.697
We need to manage our blackness
in situations like these.

05:22.781 --> 05:24.616
You're talking about assimilation?

05:24.699 --> 05:27.494
No, I'm talking about self-preservation.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.120
Quote me correctly.

05:31.498 --> 05:35.001
I grew up on the South Side of Chicago.

05:36.294 --> 05:40.090
I've actually seen
friends and family members shot.

05:40.173 --> 05:43.134
And every time it happens,
I wish they had done something,

05:43.218 --> 05:45.387
anything to prevent it.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.806
Some of y'all in here
with your liberal purity,

05:47.889 --> 05:51.518
wasting time deciding who's black enough.

05:51.601 --> 05:55.105
Who cares if you're woke or not

05:55.188 --> 05:56.565
if you're dead?

06:03.321 --> 06:05.907
[crowd murmuring]

06:11.079 --> 06:12.581
Time to shine, Lionel.

06:12.664 --> 06:14.499
How people see this is in your hands.

06:14.583 --> 06:16.376
No pressure.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.211
I don't see any other papers
covering this.

06:18.295 --> 06:19.462
[Kurt] Hey, Sam.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.089
Sam.

06:21.172 --> 06:22.882
-[groans]
-I have a great idea.

06:22.966 --> 06:24.676
You're transferring to another school?

06:24.759 --> 06:25.760
Come on, Sam.

06:25.844 --> 06:26.928
How did we get here?

06:27.012 --> 06:27.971
Who hurt you?

06:28.054 --> 06:29.347
Well, 200 years of--

06:29.431 --> 06:30.765
Slavery, got it, right.

06:30.849 --> 06:31.933
Sorry I asked.

06:32.017 --> 06:34.019
Anyway, what happened to Reggie,

06:34.102 --> 06:35.478
that was fucked up.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.105
And as people who have a voice
on this campus,

06:37.188 --> 06:39.232
you and I, we need to collab.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.026
-Kurt, that is not gonna--
-No, no, no, hear me out.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.028
You have <i>Dear White People.</i>
I have <i>Pastiche.</i>

06:43.111 --> 06:45.572
Together, we have <i>Dear White Pastiche</i>

06:45.655 --> 06:47.365
or <i>Pasty White People.</i>

06:47.449 --> 06:49.034
It's totally your call either way.

06:49.117 --> 06:50.201
But the point is,

06:50.285 --> 06:52.495
we can make racism our bitch.

06:52.579 --> 06:53.872
Weren't you the one who brought us

06:53.955 --> 06:58.418
such feel-good hits as the lawn jockey
issue and the blackface party?

06:58.501 --> 07:01.087
Well, that was actually
our first collab if you think about it.

07:01.171 --> 07:03.048
I also wrote a piece called
"The Cream in the Oreo"

07:03.131 --> 07:05.342
about my first mixed-racial threesome.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.510
People called it
"an enlightening tale of race--"

07:07.594 --> 07:08.637
Kurt,

07:08.720 --> 07:10.347
I will never, ever,

07:10.430 --> 07:12.057
never, ever, ever

07:12.140 --> 07:15.727
collab with you on your piece
of shit racist magazine.

07:15.810 --> 07:18.605
So you'll think about it
and get back to me?

07:18.688 --> 07:19.689
Okay.

07:22.484 --> 07:23.777
Hey, Reggie.

07:24.653 --> 07:26.738
I came by your room this morning.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.325
Hey, Sam.

07:31.326 --> 07:32.243
Hey, Co.

07:34.996 --> 07:37.916
Thanks for checking in, but...

07:37.999 --> 07:38.917
I'm fine.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.377
[Al] Yo, Reggie,

07:40.460 --> 07:43.630
after my class, I'm gonna come with you
to the dean's meeting.

07:43.713 --> 07:45.006
Give him a piece of my mind.

07:45.090 --> 07:48.802
Thanks, man,
but I can take care of it myself.

07:48.885 --> 07:50.887
You don't have to.

07:52.764 --> 07:53.932
Joelle and I will be there.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.059
We'll make sure that the dean
doesn't get away

07:56.142 --> 07:58.645
with his usual bullshit and no action.

07:59.437 --> 08:00.647
[Troy] If you all are going...

08:01.815 --> 08:03.400
then I'm going, too.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.901
You'll need a liaison.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.444
I must come as well.

08:06.528 --> 08:07.696
Power in numbers.

08:07.779 --> 08:08.905
You just nosy.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.949
[Gabe] Me too, man.

08:11.032 --> 08:13.910
It'll help paint this as a student issue,
not just a black-white issue.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.121
We got your back, Reggie.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.170
Where the hell is Reggie?

08:24.254 --> 08:26.214
[Dean Fairbanks]
That is an excellent question.

08:26.297 --> 08:28.758
I'm not even sure why all of you are here,

08:28.842 --> 08:30.969
except to break my Keurig machine.

08:31.052 --> 08:32.303
[sipping]

08:34.097 --> 08:36.641
Dad, can we just wait a few minutes
until Reggie gets here?

08:36.725 --> 08:38.435
[Sam] Or we can tell you what happened.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.311
We were all there. That cop was--

08:40.395 --> 08:42.105
[Dean Fairbanks] Miss White.
I don't have a meeting with you.

08:42.188 --> 08:43.690
I have a meeting with Reggie Green.

08:43.773 --> 08:45.650
Or at least I did an hour ago.

08:45.734 --> 08:47.944
Yeah, but, Dad,
he was held at gunpoint by a cop.

08:48.028 --> 08:51.114
Nothing is going to happen
unless Reggie is here, son.

08:51.865 --> 08:52.866
Yes, sir.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.743
[sighs] Some liaison.

08:54.826 --> 08:57.328
Dean Fairbanks,
this is not a good look for Winchester.

08:57.412 --> 08:59.122
The longer this goes on,
the worse it gets.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.790
Like a toothy blowjob.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.418
Sir.

09:03.501 --> 09:06.296
There are protocols
that the board must go through

09:06.379 --> 09:07.881
to review this incident,

09:07.964 --> 09:09.466
first being a statement from Reggie.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.217
Maybe we should change the protocols

09:11.301 --> 09:12.927
if they favor the person with the gun.

09:13.011 --> 09:15.430
My office is not a town hall.

09:15.513 --> 09:17.515
This incident is under review.

09:17.599 --> 09:19.350
And I have another meeting.

09:19.434 --> 09:20.435
So...

09:21.227 --> 09:22.228
please,

09:22.312 --> 09:23.563
exit!

09:29.194 --> 09:31.362
How would you feel
if this happened to Troy?

09:32.363 --> 09:34.616
Troy would never find himself
in this situation.

09:35.492 --> 09:37.327
How can you be so sure?

09:37.410 --> 09:39.537
Because <i>I</i> raised him.

09:48.171 --> 09:50.632
[Sam] I am not about to let this shit
get swept under the rug

09:50.715 --> 09:52.550
like Brandy's vehicular manslaughter.

09:52.634 --> 09:53.802
She was never charged.

09:53.885 --> 09:55.470
Does anybody know where Reggie is?

09:55.553 --> 09:57.931
-I mean, that's your boy, Sam.
-He just left.

09:58.014 --> 10:00.683
-Is this some sort of protest?
-I don't know.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.685
Wait, so you have not spoken
to him at all?

10:02.769 --> 10:04.604
No. I haven't.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.064
Okay?

10:07.232 --> 10:08.191
I--

10:08.274 --> 10:09.317
I have a solve.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.986
We'll track him down,
and we'll figure this thing out.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.196
It could be anything, okay?

10:15.532 --> 10:18.827
We gotta do it right away, though,
'cause political amnesia's a bitch.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.120
All right, when I was
a community organizer, we--

10:20.203 --> 10:24.332
Ooh, check you out, Disney Channel Obama,
what did you organize?

10:24.415 --> 10:28.962
Uh, as an undergrad, I started
the non-GMO Organic Community Garden.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.255
You know, kale, arugula, Cruciferae.

10:30.338 --> 10:33.508
-Cruciferae, huh?
-Couldn't just say leafy greens?

10:33.591 --> 10:35.552
I say it using SAT words.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.263
And if you guys haven't noticed,
outside of these hallowed brick walls,

10:38.346 --> 10:40.181
there's a community in a food desert.

10:40.265 --> 10:43.101
I do not believe Cruciferae
will solve this problem.

10:43.184 --> 10:44.310
What are we going to do?

10:47.397 --> 10:50.358
Right there. There's our opportunity.

10:52.944 --> 10:54.404
Yeah, we'll...

10:54.487 --> 10:56.072
form a human blockade.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.324
-Really get their attention.
-[Gabe] Mm-hmm.

10:58.408 --> 10:59.868
I'll bring some Beyoncé
and blast "Freedom."

10:59.951 --> 11:03.538
Yeah, I'll get in contact
with Black AF and BSU.

11:03.621 --> 11:05.874
We will yell them into submission!

11:08.501 --> 11:11.337
Uh...
huge fan of yelling, you know this,

11:11.421 --> 11:15.758
but this time, I was thinking
more emphatically stating our case

11:15.842 --> 11:19.262
so they want to work with us
on fighting systemic racism.

11:19.345 --> 11:23.099
#EmphaticallyStatingOurCase.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.976
Y'all, we have a plan.

11:25.059 --> 11:25.977
Let's move.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.020
And in the meantime,

11:27.103 --> 11:28.313
I'll get ahold of Reggie.

11:28.396 --> 11:29.397
-Cool.
-Nice.

11:29.480 --> 11:32.317
-All right.
-See you.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.735
-My darling.
-Yes?

11:33.818 --> 11:36.321
Are we still on for coffee?

11:36.404 --> 11:38.531
[inhales] Ooh.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.783
I'm not asking you to meet my parents.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.577
Just my friends.

11:42.660 --> 11:44.162
I mean, they're starting
to think you're imaginary.

11:44.746 --> 11:47.624
Besides, for some
wackadoo reason,

11:47.707 --> 11:49.250
the more I see you, the more I miss you.

11:49.918 --> 11:51.669
[kisses]

11:53.004 --> 11:54.255
Nice one.

11:54.339 --> 11:55.506
Okay.

11:55.590 --> 11:56.507
-All right?
-Okay.

11:56.591 --> 11:57.508
[chuckles]

11:59.886 --> 12:01.220
Hey, Reggie,

12:01.304 --> 12:03.598
uh, where are you?

12:04.432 --> 12:06.726
We all waited for you
at the dean's office.

12:07.977 --> 12:09.771
Anyway, um,

12:09.854 --> 12:11.439
Gabe came up--

12:11.522 --> 12:12.857
we came up with this

12:12.941 --> 12:15.360
great idea to disrupt the rally tonight.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.612
Uh, call me back ASAP.

12:18.613 --> 12:19.530
You okay?

12:20.615 --> 12:21.741
Call me.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.160
[phone beeps]

12:28.831 --> 12:30.541
[Gabe] They're gonna have it, uh...

12:30.625 --> 12:32.752
um, a quart of organic

12:32.835 --> 12:34.462
that actually pumps the air automatically

12:34.545 --> 12:36.047
when you plug it in. It's electric.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.507
-[man] That's dope.
-But it's just keys.

12:37.590 --> 12:38.591
It's a keyboard, you know.

12:38.675 --> 12:39.592
-Yeah.
-Oh, hey.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.052
-[Gabe] Sam.
-Oh.

12:41.135 --> 12:42.136
-[Gabe] Hey.
-[Sam] Hey.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.764
Sam, this is Milo...

12:44.847 --> 12:46.224
-Hey. Hi.
-[Gabe] Vanessa.

12:46.307 --> 12:47.433
-Hey.
-[Sam] Hi.

12:47.517 --> 12:48.685
-Nice to meet you.
-[Sam] You too.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.395
Your show, brilliant.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.605
-You listen?
-Who doesn't?

12:52.689 --> 12:54.274
Based on recent events,
the administration.

12:54.357 --> 12:56.192
[Vanessa] They're really
shitting the bed on this one.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.486
I knew we were dealing
with institutional racism,

12:58.569 --> 13:00.488
but at least have the dignity
to coat that shit.

13:00.571 --> 13:01.990
-[Vanessa] Hmm.
-[grunts]

13:02.407 --> 13:04.659
-Anyone's espresso taste off?
-[Vanessa] No.

13:04.742 --> 13:07.996
It's hard enough for POCs
to even get into a place like this.

13:08.079 --> 13:09.414
And then when they do,

13:09.497 --> 13:11.374
they're still subjected
to the new Jim Crow?

13:13.209 --> 13:14.669
What do you expect from a school

13:14.752 --> 13:16.546
that still has buildings
named after slave owners?

13:16.629 --> 13:18.172
Gabe, are you finally paying penance

13:18.256 --> 13:20.800
for your parents' support
of all the Bushes, including Jeb?

13:20.883 --> 13:21.801
[gasps]

13:21.884 --> 13:24.470
[gasping]

13:24.554 --> 13:26.931
[Milo] Oh, she doesn't know.

13:27.015 --> 13:30.268
Well, this is an Ivy League
Capulet and Montague situation

13:30.351 --> 13:31.394
right before our eyes.

13:31.477 --> 13:32.770
[Gabe] I...

13:32.854 --> 13:34.147
told you my parents were
from New Hampshire,

13:34.230 --> 13:35.189
I thought it was implied.

13:35.273 --> 13:36.524
It's a swing state.

13:36.607 --> 13:38.109
-I...
-[Milo] Can you even imagine

13:38.192 --> 13:39.360
a Republican Gabe?

13:39.444 --> 13:40.361
"Chaz,

13:40.445 --> 13:42.822
come summer on my very big boat.

13:42.905 --> 13:45.283
The deck is made
of endangered rhino bones."

13:45.366 --> 13:46.701
[laughing]

13:46.784 --> 13:49.704
"Roland, you must try the caviar.

13:49.787 --> 13:52.874
It's like the salty tears of poor people."

13:52.957 --> 13:56.544
[laughing]

13:56.627 --> 13:57.879
Oh, my God.

13:57.962 --> 13:59.505
[Gabe] Oh. Whew.

13:59.589 --> 14:00.590
I needed that.

14:01.466 --> 14:04.260
I can't imagine
what this has been like for you.

14:05.136 --> 14:07.597
Definitely not feeling
the school spirit lately.

14:08.306 --> 14:11.184
But we do have a little wake-up call
set up for tonight.

14:12.351 --> 14:13.686
Well...

14:13.770 --> 14:15.772
we're going to form a human blockade

14:15.855 --> 14:18.524
at the pep rally
and force the conversation.

14:18.608 --> 14:20.109
We need to see actual movement.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.236
No guns, consequences for things

14:22.320 --> 14:23.529
like blackface parties

14:23.613 --> 14:25.907
and fire that idiot campus cop.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.116
I'm there.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.701
Me too.

14:28.785 --> 14:31.120
Milo, you're skipping
Cambodian Woodworking?

14:31.204 --> 14:32.413
You love impractical electives.

14:32.497 --> 14:34.999
Heroism requires sacrifice.

14:36.584 --> 14:38.711
Mm, I think I ordered decaf.

14:38.795 --> 14:39.879
[clears throat]

14:39.962 --> 14:41.589
Have you told Reggie yet?

14:41.672 --> 14:43.049
Uh, I--

14:43.132 --> 14:44.467
I can't get ahold of him.

14:44.550 --> 14:45.593
He's been MIA.

14:45.676 --> 14:46.677
[Vanessa] Well, makes sense.

14:46.761 --> 14:47.678
Public victim.

14:47.762 --> 14:48.721
Public what now?

14:48.805 --> 14:51.224
Well, in Behavioral Psych,
we've been talking about

14:51.307 --> 14:53.434
how public victims
don't have time to grieve

14:53.518 --> 14:56.312
because their trauma
is immediately politicized,

14:56.396 --> 15:00.441
especially with social media
and the 24-hour news cycle.

15:01.317 --> 15:02.235
It's a lot.

15:03.945 --> 15:05.113
They switched to Arabica beans.

15:05.196 --> 15:07.448
[all] Ohh.

15:10.368 --> 15:11.244
Reggie.

15:11.994 --> 15:14.038
Yo. What's up, Sam?

15:14.122 --> 15:15.289
[Sam] Hey.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.750
I've been looking for you all day.

15:17.834 --> 15:19.168
How are you?

15:19.252 --> 15:20.086
Fine.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.630
[scoffs]

15:22.713 --> 15:24.757
You weren't at the meeting with Fairbanks.

15:24.841 --> 15:26.342
We were all waiting for you.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.385
Got busy.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.095
We might have to reschedule.

15:31.639 --> 15:33.433
Reggie, you're being weird.

15:33.516 --> 15:34.684
Talk to me.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.477
I said I was fine.

15:36.561 --> 15:38.146
That was me, talking.

15:38.229 --> 15:39.856
And it was directed at you.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.899
Can't be more clearer.

15:42.817 --> 15:43.943
Okay.

15:44.652 --> 15:47.864
Well, did you get my messages
about breaking up the pep rally?

15:47.947 --> 15:49.866
Yep. All 19 of 'em.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.784
You know, your Beyoncé gifs

15:51.868 --> 15:53.035
take up a lot of memory.

15:53.619 --> 15:54.704
Worth it.

15:56.831 --> 15:57.874
Where you going?

15:57.957 --> 15:59.459
[Reggie] I got somewhere to be.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.878
Okay, well, I'm coming with.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.881
[acoustic guitar playing]

16:15.600 --> 16:17.977
All this time I've known you,
I've never been here.

16:18.561 --> 16:19.854
Come here all the time.

16:20.646 --> 16:22.106
There's no need to hide it.

16:22.190 --> 16:24.150
[Reggie] I'm not hiding anything.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.361
Joelle's been here with me a couple times.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.239
Well, don't hesitate to invite me.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.950
-I'm always down for--
-Shh.

16:33.618 --> 16:36.579
[slow strumming, music fades]

16:44.545 --> 16:45.713
[feedback whining]

16:45.796 --> 16:49.509
It's totally crazy
what's been going on on campus lately,

16:50.092 --> 16:53.095
and I just wanted to do something to help.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.264
I want my pain

16:55.348 --> 16:56.974
to heal Winchester.

17:00.728 --> 17:03.648
[percussive funk music playing]

17:14.617 --> 17:16.285
[Sam] What is this,

17:17.036 --> 17:19.914
<i>Tyler Perry Presents The Nutcracker?</i>

17:19.997 --> 17:22.416
She's raising the roof off of racism.

17:24.835 --> 17:27.755
This is like some
Jane Fonda woke aerobics.

17:35.972 --> 17:37.265
All right, girl,

17:37.348 --> 17:39.392
time to wrap up <i>12 Minutes A Slave.</i>

17:51.445 --> 17:53.364
I love you, baby.

17:53.447 --> 17:56.284
[applause]

17:56.367 --> 17:58.578
They're gonna have
really weird sex tonight.

17:58.661 --> 18:00.204
Mm-hmm.

18:00.288 --> 18:02.623
[Sam] How many cultures
did she appropriate in that set?

18:02.707 --> 18:03.958
[Reggie] I counted about eight.

18:04.041 --> 18:05.543
Mm, impressive.

18:06.627 --> 18:08.796
[inhales]

18:08.879 --> 18:10.381
Uh...

18:10.464 --> 18:11.757
look, I've been

18:11.841 --> 18:13.301
processing.

18:13.384 --> 18:14.552
I get it.

18:14.635 --> 18:16.345
Do what you need to do.

18:17.471 --> 18:18.681
Thanks.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.224
Time for open slots.

18:20.308 --> 18:21.934
Anyone have something they want
to bring up?

18:33.654 --> 18:35.823
[feedback whines]

18:39.952 --> 18:43.539
We hold these truths to be self-evident,

18:43.623 --> 18:45.958
that all men are created equal,

18:46.626 --> 18:48.461
that they are endowed by their Creator

18:48.544 --> 18:50.713
with certain unalienable rights,

18:50.796 --> 18:53.549
among these life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness,

18:55.051 --> 18:57.470
unless you're loud and black
and possess an opinion,

18:57.553 --> 18:59.013
then all you get is a bullet,

18:59.096 --> 19:00.765
a bullet that held me at bay,

19:00.848 --> 19:03.601
a bullet that can puncture my skin,
take all my dreams away,

19:03.684 --> 19:05.061
a bullet that can silence
the words that I speak

19:05.144 --> 19:07.063
to my mother just because I'm other,

19:07.146 --> 19:08.397
a bullet...

19:09.899 --> 19:11.275
held me captive.

19:13.736 --> 19:16.030
Gun in my face, your hate misplaced.

19:16.113 --> 19:18.949
White skin, light skin,
but for me, not the right skin.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.370
Judging me with no crime committed.

19:22.453 --> 19:24.538
Reckless trigger finger
itching to prove your worth

19:24.622 --> 19:25.790
by disproving mine,

19:25.873 --> 19:27.458
my life in your hands,

19:27.541 --> 19:29.043
my life on the line.

19:31.462 --> 19:32.713
Fred Hampton.

19:33.547 --> 19:35.675
Tamir Rice. Rekia Boyd.

19:37.885 --> 19:39.595
Reggie Green?

19:42.264 --> 19:44.266
Spared by a piece of paper, a student ID

19:44.350 --> 19:47.103
that you had to see
before you could identify me

19:47.186 --> 19:48.979
and set me supposedly free.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.360
Life,

19:54.443 --> 19:57.446
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

20:00.282 --> 20:01.951
For some of us, maybe.

20:06.789 --> 20:09.250
There's nothing self-evident about it.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.421
[applause]

20:19.260 --> 20:20.636
That was beautiful.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.389
Thank you.

20:24.181 --> 20:25.641
Nah, for real, though.

20:26.475 --> 20:28.602
You were giving me Langston vibes

20:28.686 --> 20:30.813
with a splash of Baldwin

20:30.896 --> 20:33.691
and the modern-day vulnerability
of Frank Ocean.

20:34.358 --> 20:36.527
Except you actually release your art
when you plan to.

20:36.610 --> 20:38.154
[chuckles]

20:38.237 --> 20:41.115
Well, I'm just taking a page out
of your book.

20:41.198 --> 20:42.825
You stir shit up.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.201
You're Huey Newton,

20:44.285 --> 20:45.578
running up on the state capitol

20:45.661 --> 20:46.829
with a bunch of guns,

20:46.912 --> 20:49.957
but you do it better

20:50.040 --> 20:51.208
with a mic.

20:53.210 --> 20:55.504
Just glad I got the chance
to share it with you.

20:56.338 --> 20:57.298
Me too.

21:00.885 --> 21:03.220
I can't believe I've been
missing out on this.

21:04.221 --> 21:07.141
[chuckles] It's not that big a deal.

21:07.224 --> 21:08.768
It is a big deal.

21:09.685 --> 21:12.813
It was fearless...

21:12.897 --> 21:14.106
and honest.

21:16.317 --> 21:17.902
You know what?

21:17.985 --> 21:19.904
What you said needs to be heard.

21:21.405 --> 21:23.866
What if you shared it
at the pep rally tonight?

21:24.658 --> 21:26.535
Sam.

21:26.619 --> 21:27.828
Reggie.

21:28.662 --> 21:29.872
Reggie.

21:29.955 --> 21:33.083
We'll make sure the blockade
gives you space so you're not interrupted,

21:33.167 --> 21:35.294
and we'll even get you a bullhorn.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.004
That poem was for me,

21:37.087 --> 21:38.088
not your rally.

21:38.172 --> 21:39.882
It's <i>our</i> rally.

21:39.965 --> 21:43.010
What you said is what everyone else
needs to hear.

21:43.093 --> 21:45.304
-Sam.
-[scoffs]

21:45.387 --> 21:47.598
If you can shake the earth at an open mic,

21:47.681 --> 21:49.850
you can shake the whole damn school.

21:49.934 --> 21:52.353
My pain is not your platform.

21:53.354 --> 21:55.481
The whole movement is about pain.

21:55.564 --> 21:57.274
That's why we're out in these streets,

21:57.358 --> 21:59.276
because of our pain.

21:59.860 --> 22:02.196
You don't think Martin had pain?

22:02.279 --> 22:03.614
You don't think Malcolm had pain?

22:03.697 --> 22:07.076
Right now, I just need to be a man
and not a movement.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.829
Ever since freshman year,
you have done nothing

22:09.912 --> 22:12.456
but look to me to be the leader
of the movement.

22:12.540 --> 22:15.042
You've put it on me every single day.

22:15.125 --> 22:17.336
Don't you think
there's a woman under here?

22:17.419 --> 22:20.172
Sam, I didn't mean to put anything on you.

22:23.092 --> 22:24.468
I just believe in you.

22:24.552 --> 22:25.803
I root for you.

22:25.886 --> 22:27.054
When I see you,

22:27.137 --> 22:29.765
I see the best in you.

22:32.476 --> 22:33.435
I see a leader.

22:37.147 --> 22:38.858
Well, maybe sometimes,

22:39.900 --> 22:42.194
I want you to just see me.

22:42.278 --> 22:44.196
Is that why you chose him?

22:46.073 --> 22:48.200
Do you know how hard it was

22:48.284 --> 22:50.911
seeing you two together last night,

22:50.995 --> 22:52.913
walking home together?

22:52.997 --> 22:58.127
You've been stringing me along
since the first day I met you.

22:58.919 --> 23:01.881
Never there for me
when I <i>needed</i> you.

23:01.964 --> 23:03.674
And last night,

23:03.757 --> 23:05.342
I was in a house full of people

23:05.426 --> 23:06.844
and I've never felt...

23:07.886 --> 23:09.597
more alone.

23:17.479 --> 23:19.815
I'm here now, Reggie.

23:23.986 --> 23:25.613
I am here.

23:30.534 --> 23:31.785
Fuck it.

23:32.703 --> 23:35.247
It'll be okay. Let's just go to the rally.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.083
No.

23:39.209 --> 23:40.753
You stay.

23:42.087 --> 23:43.172
I'll go.

23:45.174 --> 23:48.218
[keys jingle]

23:48.302 --> 23:49.470
[sighs]

23:49.553 --> 23:52.723
[lock turning]

23:52.806 --> 23:56.268
So, um, what are you gonna do?

23:56.852 --> 23:59.313
Probably just put on <i>Defamation,</i>

23:59.396 --> 24:00.689
do a little hate-watch

24:00.773 --> 24:02.066
to get my mind off things.

24:09.156 --> 24:10.783
