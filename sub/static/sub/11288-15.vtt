00:02.703 --> 00:03.637
[grunts]

00:03.703 --> 00:04.771
I swear, man,
this is worse than

00:04.938 --> 00:07.173
when I used to dress
my kitten in Barbie clothes.

00:09.175 --> 00:10.210
You know, my German Shepherd

00:10.276 --> 00:12.713
never got over you
dressin' him up.

00:12.779 --> 00:15.381
Puttin' panties on a dog?

00:15.448 --> 00:16.617
Hey, what's up,
what's up, hey!

00:16.683 --> 00:18.218
Who's got a pantyhose
for me?

00:18.284 --> 00:21.221
Uh, Regine has a brand new pair
on her bed.

00:21.287 --> 00:22.723
Thanks.

00:24.758 --> 00:28.662
Those are bulge‐away
body skimmers.

00:28.729 --> 00:31.765
Now that'll be $12.95,
cash, no check.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.869
You know, Khadijah

00:35.936 --> 00:39.706
I couldn't be happier
if I was accepting the Li..

00:39.773 --> 00:44.545
Oh, Linwood‐Hans
Journalism Award myself.

00:44.611 --> 00:48.081
Hey, an award for me
is an award for Flavor.

00:48.148 --> 00:50.651
So, since you work there,
it's almost like you gettin' it.

00:50.717 --> 00:51.652
‐ Really?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.419
That means I can
keep it on my desk?

00:53.486 --> 00:55.856
You touch it and you die.

00:55.922 --> 00:57.858
[chuckles]

00:57.924 --> 01:00.060
Help me, I'm in..

01:01.467 --> 01:02.969
What happened? What..

01:03.036 --> 01:04.905
‐ What's wrong with you?
‐ Get your tops.

01:04.971 --> 01:07.040
‐ Oh, oh, God.
‐ I can't breathe.

01:07.107 --> 01:08.808
‐ Uh‐huh, uh‐huh.
‐ Cut me.

01:08.875 --> 01:11.177
[indistinct chatter]

01:11.244 --> 01:12.813
‐ Take a deep breath, breathe.
‐ No.

In fact,
we all look fabulous.

It's amazing how we're fighting
off the ravages of time.

02:03.670 --> 02:05.839
We've hardly changed.

I haven't changed at all.

No, I haven't.
No, I haven't.

You're right.

At least we get along
better than we used to.

I'd never be in the same room

02:31.031 --> 02:33.934

02:34.000 --> 02:37.538
Oh, yes, the dark ages,
that chilly bitter month

02:37.604 --> 02:39.873
when you lived with us.

02:39.940 --> 02:42.442
And I went out with Kyle.

You went out with Kyle?

Hey, hey.

02:56.723 --> 02:57.658
[scoffs]

03:00.226 --> 03:03.269
‐ Roses for your beauty.
‐ Aw.

03:03.336 --> 03:05.772
Tulips for your smile.

03:05.839 --> 03:07.941
And, uh, uh, I don't know
what this one is

03:08.008 --> 03:09.910
let's just say
it represents your mystery.

03:09.976 --> 03:11.578
Aw.
Thank you.

03:16.517 --> 03:20.320
Regine, baby, parting is
such sweet sorrow.

03:20.386 --> 03:21.922
And lookin' at you
is just sorrow.

03:24.424 --> 03:28.862
Aw, dear, sweet Kyle,
he's so in love with me.

03:28.929 --> 03:30.697
But who can blame him?

03:39.005 --> 03:41.341
Give a sister a chance.

03:43.243 --> 03:46.813
Yeah, well, thank you
for nothin'.

03:46.880 --> 03:48.715
Brother.

03:48.782 --> 03:50.884
That's the third bank today
that's turned me down

03:50.951 --> 03:52.719
for a loan
for my magazine.

03:52.786 --> 03:54.621
Well, if you came up
with a name

03:54.688 --> 03:56.690
for your little
home‐girl gazette

03:56.757 --> 03:59.225
I'm sure somebody
might take you seriously.

03:59.292 --> 04:02.536
I took it so seriously, I came
up with a whole list of names.

04:05.105 --> 04:08.008
‐ "Ebonyette."
‐ Alright.

04:08.074 --> 04:10.010
"Essence of Brooklyn."

04:11.678 --> 04:15.381
‐ "Afropolitan."
‐ Oh.

04:15.448 --> 04:18.619
Can't believe these names
haven't been snapped up.

04:18.685 --> 04:20.687
Care to join us? Ahem.

04:20.754 --> 04:23.857

roommate, Regine.

04:32.132 --> 04:33.933

04:36.169 --> 04:37.403
Enjoy.

04:41.474 --> 04:43.777
Thank you, Maxine.

04:43.844 --> 04:45.679
What's with this
fake friendliness?

04:45.746 --> 04:49.115
Not a drug in the world
could bring you to together.

04:49.182 --> 04:52.753
Regine and I have called
a truce until I pass the bar.

04:52.819 --> 04:55.455
I hope this truce lasts longer
than the last time.

04:55.522 --> 04:58.759
You two shook hands
and ended up arm wrestling.

04:58.825 --> 05:02.068
A battle, as I recall I won.

05:02.135 --> 05:05.806
Only because you put your
boobs into it.

05:05.872 --> 05:08.675
Just trying to compensate
for your mannish hands.

05:11.044 --> 05:13.647
Mm, what flavor.

05:15.682 --> 05:19.385
That's it! Flavor, that's what
I'm gonna call my magazine.

roam around the city

for money" sign.

won't be up all the time.

sisterhood to the test.

Yeah, I still
can't believe her head

08:42.743 --> 08:44.811
There's a beauty
in their bitterness.

08:44.878 --> 08:48.248
If Max hadn't moved out,
I couldn't have moved in.

08:48.314 --> 08:51.217
Yeah, and if Kyle hadn't
invited me to move to New York

08:51.284 --> 08:52.819
my heart would have
been in Minneapolis

08:52.886 --> 08:54.187
and I wouldn't have
known why.

08:54.254 --> 08:55.188
Oh.

09:02.869 --> 09:04.304
Overton?

09:04.370 --> 09:08.141
You're doing such a great job
fixing my building.

09:08.208 --> 09:10.611
I could just give you a deep

09:10.677 --> 09:13.980
long, lingering kiss.

09:17.483 --> 09:21.154
Um, I don't think that'd
be appropriate, Ms. Brooks.

09:23.056 --> 09:24.925
You're right.

09:24.991 --> 09:26.326
Let's have sex.

over to my place

09:36.202 --> 09:39.573
and have a cup of hot chocolate

09:39.640 --> 09:42.509
with a touch of brandy?

09:42.576 --> 09:45.111
Um, not while I'm working

09:45.178 --> 09:49.015
uh, which I hope to make
full time.

09:49.082 --> 09:51.484
Overton, you're hired.

09:51.552 --> 09:52.853
And I'm not just saying that

09:52.919 --> 09:54.888
because you have a cute tush.

09:56.422 --> 09:58.091
There I go again.

09:59.292 --> 10:01.935
I'm such a bad girl.

10:03.770 --> 10:04.938
Um, Ms. Brooks, uh, look

10:05.005 --> 10:07.407
my, uh, my tush and I
thank you.

10:07.473 --> 10:08.675
‐ See you. Gotta go.
‐ Uh‐huh.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.076
Yeah.

10:12.278 --> 10:13.246
[groans]

10:13.313 --> 10:14.948
‐ Hey, what's up, man?
‐ Oh.

10:15.015 --> 10:18.685
You're look at the Brownstone's
new full time handyman.

10:18.752 --> 10:20.320
Alright, congratulations.

10:20.386 --> 10:22.923
That's right, that's right.

10:22.989 --> 10:24.925
You know, I decided to, um

10:24.991 --> 10:27.628
nip my involvement with Regine
in the bud, man.

10:27.694 --> 10:28.729
What?

10:28.795 --> 10:29.963
She does nothin' but talk about

10:30.030 --> 10:31.231
herself all the time.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.600
You cannot imagine
how annoying that is.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.536
Mm, yes, I can.

10:35.602 --> 10:37.704
Kyle.

10:37.771 --> 10:41.341
Let me make this plain, honey.
It's over.

10:41.407 --> 10:44.044
I got asked out by a guy
who's already there

10:44.110 --> 10:45.846
not just on his way.

10:45.912 --> 10:47.380
Now, I hope that
we can remain

10:47.447 --> 10:49.082
after you're totally over me

10:49.149 --> 10:50.917
friends.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.986
[chuckles]

10:53.053 --> 10:55.956
Um, Regine, darling,
crushed as I am

10:56.022 --> 10:58.925
um, I'm sure that
I'll get over you

10:58.992 --> 11:01.167
long before
you get over yourself.

11:02.335 --> 11:04.037
Ah, ah, ah,
Khadijah's not home, go away.

11:04.104 --> 11:05.171
Go away.

11:05.238 --> 11:06.406
I just came to pick up
some law books

11:06.472 --> 11:08.642
and some doughnuts
I left here last month.

11:08.709 --> 11:09.876
[tires screeching]

11:09.943 --> 11:12.879
[upbeat music]

11:14.114 --> 11:16.950
Oh.
Hello, Brooklyn!

11:17.017 --> 11:19.085
Oh, my Lord!

11:19.152 --> 11:21.087
‐ Oh.
‐ Woo‐hoo.

11:21.154 --> 11:22.088
[tires screeching]

11:25.458 --> 11:27.260
Hey, everybody,
this is my cousin, Synclaire.

11:27.327 --> 11:28.394
Hi, nice to meet you.

11:28.461 --> 11:29.996
You know our college
roommate Max, right?

11:30.063 --> 11:31.698
‐ Yes, hello, hi.
‐ Welcome.

11:31.765 --> 11:34.535
I enjoyed all the cookies
you sent Khadijah in college.

11:34.601 --> 11:35.902
‐ Thank you.
‐ Oh.

11:35.969 --> 11:37.437
She's a hungry one.

11:37.504 --> 11:38.639
‐ Hello.
‐ This is our neighbor, Kyle.

11:38.705 --> 11:40.774
‐ How do?
‐ Gotham greet you.

11:40.841 --> 11:43.877
And your gargantuan
friend there.

11:43.944 --> 11:45.178
Funny people, okay.

11:45.245 --> 11:46.379
And this is his
roommate, Overton.

11:46.446 --> 11:48.048
Hi, hello.

11:52.352 --> 11:55.021
And he is our building's
resident handyman

11:55.088 --> 11:58.291
and he is ridiculously
pleased to meet you.

11:58.358 --> 12:01.467
Wow, the handyman
lives in the building.

12:01.535 --> 12:02.903
How handy.

12:02.969 --> 12:04.004
[giggles]

12:04.070 --> 12:05.005
Might you help me with

12:05.071 --> 12:07.140
my troll Crispus Attucks?

12:07.207 --> 12:08.174
Thank you.

12:08.241 --> 12:09.309
Come on, Khadijah, I'm home.

12:09.375 --> 12:10.811
[laughs]

12:10.877 --> 12:12.112
Yeah, let‐let's
get this stuff in

12:12.178 --> 12:14.981
before somebody
sees me with it.

12:15.048 --> 12:18.351
Shorty, today
I met the woman I'mma marry.

12:18.418 --> 12:19.720
You said that after
you and Melody broke up.

12:19.786 --> 12:21.588
You swore off women.

12:21.655 --> 12:23.156
That's not just a woman.

12:23.223 --> 12:26.092
That right there
is my baby's mama.

12:26.159 --> 12:28.562
[laughs]

12:28.629 --> 12:31.598
And as I pulled Crispus
from the jeep

12:31.665 --> 12:34.334
and he pinned me to the ground

12:34.400 --> 12:36.369
then I realized
this was the beginning

12:36.436 --> 12:38.705
of a beautiful relationship.

12:39.873 --> 12:41.708
‐ Oh.
‐ Oh.

12:41.775 --> 12:43.309
Sorry, folks, we've got a flat.

12:43.376 --> 12:48.048
Uh, in the immortal words
of Boys 2 Men

12:48.114 --> 12:50.050
"This is the end
of the road."

12:52.018 --> 12:53.987
Bump that, I'm making
a run for it.

12:54.054 --> 12:55.488
The ceremony starts
in a half an hour

12:55.556 --> 12:57.658
and I'll be damned
if I don't get my award

12:57.724 --> 13:00.260
because of this
stretch lemon.

13:00.326 --> 13:03.003
Alright, hold on, we'll just,
we'll just catch a cab.

13:03.069 --> 13:05.639
[laughing]

13:05.706 --> 13:07.774
Six black people in
the middle of the night.

13:07.841 --> 13:08.842
Why don't we just
send up a signal

13:08.909 --> 13:10.376
and wait for
the Bat Mobile?

13:11.845 --> 13:14.380
Alright, now, alright,
everybody just relax.

13:14.447 --> 13:15.582
I mean, come on.

13:15.649 --> 13:17.483
With this leg, oh please.

13:17.551 --> 13:19.452
I can get a cab in seconds.

13:19.520 --> 13:20.921
What are you gonna do,
trip it?

13:25.291 --> 13:27.661
Look, y'all, there's a subway
station right over there.

13:27.728 --> 13:30.330
We take the express, we'll be
uptown in seven minutes.

13:30.396 --> 13:32.633
And if my boy Slappy's
the motorman, five.

13:32.699 --> 13:33.967
‐ Let's bounce.
‐ Let's roll, let's roll.

13:34.034 --> 13:37.037
Hold up, you are all forgetting
you're with Regine Hunter.

13:37.103 --> 13:39.039
And there are two things
I do not do.

13:39.105 --> 13:42.275
Go Dutch
and ride the subway.

13:42.342 --> 13:43.977
Well, you and your leg
can stay in here

13:44.044 --> 13:44.978
'cause I'm going to get mine.

13:45.045 --> 13:46.980
[indistinct chatter]

13:53.854 --> 13:54.921
Thanks to you, I'm gonna be late

13:54.988 --> 13:57.023
to the most important
night of my life.

13:57.090 --> 13:58.692
Well, who would have thought
that a limo company

13:58.759 --> 14:02.202
called Easy Ed's Deluxe Rides
would be so cheesy?

14:02.268 --> 14:04.004
The naked woman on the mud flap

14:04.070 --> 14:06.740
should've been
the first tip off.

14:06.807 --> 14:09.209
Hey, y'all, quit trippin'
on my baby now.

14:09.275 --> 14:10.611
'Cause you know in your hearts
you're glad

14:10.677 --> 14:12.178
you didn't send her
back to Minnesota

14:12.245 --> 14:14.447
like you were planning
way back when.

14:15.549 --> 14:17.317
‐ What?
‐ Oh, yeah, girl.

14:17.383 --> 14:18.985
You was on your way.

14:21.855 --> 14:24.691
Ah!
What the hell?

14:24.758 --> 14:27.227
Damn demon dolls
are everywhere!

14:27.293 --> 14:29.462
And that Crispus Attucks
is the worst!

14:29.530 --> 14:31.532
I swear that thing follows
me around with its eyes

14:31.598 --> 14:33.667
when I'm gettin' dressed.

14:33.734 --> 14:35.569
Don't flatter yourself, Regine.

14:35.636 --> 14:37.604
Crispus is not a peepin' troll.

14:39.239 --> 14:41.742
Come on now, hey, when we agreed
to let Synclaire move in

14:41.808 --> 14:43.309
we knew what we were gettin'.

14:43.376 --> 14:45.178
She got a big heart.

14:45.245 --> 14:47.313
So what if she's
a little bugged?

14:51.552 --> 14:53.386
‐ Synclaire!
‐ Huh?

14:53.453 --> 14:56.757
Tell me those are not the notes
for my first cover story?

14:56.823 --> 14:58.424
Is that what you wanna hear?

14:59.960 --> 15:02.603
Oh, but I'll have these back
together lickety split.

15:02.669 --> 15:06.406
And, uh, oh, yeah, I'll have the
fax machine fixed by tomorrow.

15:06.472 --> 15:09.676
Uh, after the electricity
comes back on.

15:09.743 --> 15:10.677
You..

15:11.878 --> 15:13.914
That's it.

15:13.980 --> 15:16.382
Heads, we send her stuff.

15:16.449 --> 15:18.619
Tails, I'mma help you pack.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.621
No!

15:22.455 --> 15:24.558
Come on, Khadijah, don't you
think sending Synclaire

15:24.625 --> 15:25.959
back home is a little harsh?

15:26.026 --> 15:27.561
I mean, how about the way
she bakes cookies for you

15:27.628 --> 15:29.062
after a hard day
of furnish repair?

15:29.129 --> 15:31.097
Or how she always has an extra
sheet of fabric softener

15:31.164 --> 15:32.999
when you coincidentally do your
laundry every Sunday?

15:33.066 --> 15:34.935
How about that, huh?

15:35.001 --> 15:38.639
Guess who I ran over on the way
back from the coffee shop?

15:38.705 --> 15:39.806
Come here.

15:43.577 --> 15:45.679
Do you have a couple
of aspirin and a body cast?

15:45.746 --> 15:47.180
Coming right up!

15:47.247 --> 15:49.616
Kareem Abdul‐Jabbar.

15:49.683 --> 15:51.217
Mr. Skyhook.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.419
Man, I had a pair of those
those fish bowl goggles

15:53.486 --> 15:54.655
just like you had
in high school.

15:54.721 --> 15:55.989
Did it help your game any?

15:56.056 --> 15:57.223
No, but I was
the sharpest dressed

15:57.290 --> 15:59.526
welder in shop class.

15:59.593 --> 16:00.661
Here you go.

16:00.727 --> 16:02.769
Kareem, I'd like you
to meet Khadijah

16:02.836 --> 16:04.505
the publisher of Flavor.

16:04.571 --> 16:06.707
Khadijah, this is Kareem

16:06.773 --> 16:08.909
your first cover story.

16:08.975 --> 16:11.678
‐ What? For real?
‐ Yes.

16:11.745 --> 16:15.315
Oh, you've got a job for life,
cuz, thank you.

16:15.381 --> 16:16.683
You know, if it weren't
for that interview

16:16.750 --> 16:18.451
Flavor might not be
on the map.

16:18.519 --> 16:21.454
[brakes screeching]

16:22.956 --> 16:24.090
<i>(male #1 on speakers)</i>
<i>Attention, passengers.</i>

16:24.157 --> 16:25.792
<i>We have a small</i>
<i>mechanical problem.</i>

16:25.859 --> 16:28.361
<i>We should be movin' in no more</i>
<i>than an hour and a half.</i>

16:28.428 --> 16:29.563
[groaning]

16:29.630 --> 16:31.665
Oh, what the hell!

16:31.732 --> 16:35.401
Come on, train,
don't play me like this.

16:35.468 --> 16:38.138
Where do you think you're going?
We're in a tunnel.

16:38.204 --> 16:40.574
The thought of being
stuck next to you

16:40.641 --> 16:43.076
uh, frightens me.
Excuse me.

16:44.745 --> 16:46.412
That's it.

16:46.479 --> 16:48.314
We're not gonna make it.

16:48.381 --> 16:49.850
I'm not gonna get my award.

16:49.916 --> 16:53.520
‐ Oh, now, come on, Khadijah.
‐ I won't get the award.

16:53.587 --> 16:56.122
That award ceremonys,
that's about some stuffed shirts

16:56.189 --> 16:57.490
in a, in a banquet.

16:57.558 --> 17:00.160
I mean Flavor's about
the people.

17:00.226 --> 17:01.635
That's right.

17:01.702 --> 17:04.270
The college student.

17:04.337 --> 17:07.107
'Or the young
struggling mother.'

17:09.510 --> 17:12.746
'Or the businessman with
the questionable hair piece.'

17:14.647 --> 17:18.084
‐ Hey, these are your readers.
‐ Hey.

17:18.151 --> 17:21.320
You publish Flavor magazine?

17:21.387 --> 17:24.223
I love that magazine.

17:24.290 --> 17:25.892
I'm wearin' it right now.

17:25.959 --> 17:28.161
[groaning]

17:28.228 --> 17:32.065
See, Khadijah? Your work
touches everyone, oh.

17:32.132 --> 17:34.901
Oh, holy cow.

17:37.838 --> 17:40.507
Holy cow,
it's Holyfield.

17:40.574 --> 17:42.909
Man, that fight
was off the hook.

17:42.976 --> 17:45.145
Man, you put the fear of God
in Mike Tyson.

17:45.211 --> 17:46.847
Well, that fear
everyone should have.

17:46.913 --> 17:49.916
Well, praise him,
praise him!

17:49.983 --> 17:52.118
Excuse me, Mr. Holyfield,
I understand you won

17:52.290 --> 17:54.354
$11 million
on your last fight.

17:54.420 --> 17:56.723
Should you need
a good stock broker.

17:56.790 --> 17:58.859
Alrighty then.

17:58.925 --> 18:02.135
What are you doing
riding the subway?

18:02.202 --> 18:03.937
It's fast
and who gonna mug me?

18:04.004 --> 18:04.938
Oh, shoot.

18:05.005 --> 18:06.607
Not, not without no gun.

18:06.673 --> 18:07.708
[laughs]

18:09.075 --> 18:12.713
Mr. Holyfield, I understand
that you have recently built

18:12.779 --> 18:16.249
a 55,000 square foot mansion.

18:18.519 --> 18:21.421
So, tell me,
how's the marriage?

18:22.789 --> 18:26.560
‐ Made in heaven.
‐ Oh, I'm very happy for you.

18:27.828 --> 18:28.962
[screams]

18:29.029 --> 18:30.496
We're movin'!

18:30.564 --> 18:31.798
[laughs]

18:31.865 --> 18:33.099
[applause]

18:33.166 --> 18:34.367
Look at these clowns.

18:34.434 --> 18:36.169
They squeeze themselves
into a tuxedo

18:36.236 --> 18:37.437
and they think
they're James Bond.

18:37.504 --> 18:38.572
[chuckles]

18:38.639 --> 18:40.774
It's been a while, Dr. No.

18:40.841 --> 18:43.677
So long you're starting
to look good.

18:43.744 --> 18:46.446
Maybe you're just starting
to see straight.

18:46.513 --> 18:48.649
I have to admit that
I am so excited

18:48.715 --> 18:51.852
to present this next,
most prestigious award

18:51.918 --> 18:54.855
to an innovative and insightful
young journalist.

18:54.921 --> 18:56.823
It's hard to believe that
not too many years ago

18:56.890 --> 18:59.259
she was my intern
at Essence magazine.

18:59.325 --> 19:01.502
'Well, now it's my pleasure,
ladies and gentlemen'

19:01.568 --> 19:04.605
'to honor tonight,
the founder and the editor'

19:04.671 --> 19:07.440
'of Flavor magazine,
Khadijah James.'

19:07.508 --> 19:10.443
[applause]

19:20.353 --> 19:23.289
Thank you so much, Susan,
for your inspiration.

19:24.758 --> 19:28.829
I would like to thank
the committee for this honor.

19:28.895 --> 19:31.431
I share this award
with my mother

19:31.497 --> 19:33.299
who isn't here

19:33.366 --> 19:34.868
because my cousin
booked her a limo

19:34.935 --> 19:36.670
so God knows where she is.

19:36.737 --> 19:37.771
[laughs]

19:37.838 --> 19:39.640
I booked Budget Benito's.
Who knew?

19:39.706 --> 19:41.675
[laughing]

19:41.742 --> 19:45.311
I also share this award
with the crew of Flavor.

19:45.378 --> 19:47.347
Couldn't do it without you guys.

19:48.882 --> 19:51.217
And my friends,
for supporting me

19:51.284 --> 19:54.020
through all the madness.

19:54.087 --> 19:56.957
Making jelly bean pyramids
for me to cheer me up.

19:57.023 --> 19:58.424
[chuckles]

19:58.491 --> 20:02.769
'Checking my wardrobe, to make
sure it was tasteful, yet fly.'

20:02.836 --> 20:04.037
[chuckles]

20:04.104 --> 20:08.341
'Offering me financial advice,
legal counselling'

20:08.408 --> 20:12.112
'and a certain home spun wisdom'

20:12.178 --> 20:13.346
'whether I wanted it or not.'

20:13.413 --> 20:15.348
[laughs]

20:17.518 --> 20:20.721
Guys, I love y'all.
Thank you so much.

20:20.787 --> 20:24.490
Oh, look at that,
look at that.

20:24.558 --> 20:27.227
You know something? I had
a really good time tonight.

20:27.293 --> 20:29.696
Yeah, it was fun,
getting all dressed up

20:29.763 --> 20:33.767
and lunging into
Evander Holyfield.

20:33.834 --> 20:36.503
Carrying your award
all the way home

20:36.570 --> 20:39.039
pretending it was
that Junior Miss trophy

20:39.105 --> 20:41.341
them judges stole from me.

20:41.407 --> 20:44.911
Gave it to that moon‐faced
heifer from Asbury Park.

20:44.978 --> 20:47.648
Just 'cause she rescued
a bull load of campers.

20:47.714 --> 20:50.551
Girl, give me that,
give me that. Move back.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.052
[instrumental music]

20:52.118 --> 20:54.354
‐ Uh‐oh, not my jam
