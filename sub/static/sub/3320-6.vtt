still be miserable and lonely.

10:54.436 --> 10:55.698
That'’s actually true.

10:55.785 --> 10:57.918
I'’ve seen cartoons about that.

10:59.354 --> 11:01.138
[doorbell rings]

11:01.225 --> 11:03.880
I got it.

11:03.967 --> 11:06.448
You realize she'’s
setting you up to fail.

11:11.409 --> 11:12.628
Hi.

11:12.715 --> 11:14.369
Hello.

11:14.456 --> 11:16.284
I want to apologize.

11:16.371 --> 11:18.590
Are those part
of the apology?

11:18.678 --> 11:20.331
Neiman Marcus.

11:20.418 --> 11:21.768
Where are my manners?
Come on in.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.816
Christy, Neiman
Marcus is here!

11:28.557 --> 11:29.601
I like your new place.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.647
Don'’t patronize me.

11:31.734 --> 11:34.084
Jill, you okay?

11:34.171 --> 11:37.697
Yeah. And thank you for leaving
all those sweet messages.

11:37.784 --> 11:39.916
Oh. I was worried about you.

11:40.003 --> 11:41.657
I don'’t know what to say.

11:41.744 --> 11:43.354
I'’m really embarrassed
about the way I behaved,

11:43.441 --> 11:46.357
and I thought maybe I could
make it up to you guys.

11:46.444 --> 11:49.534
Oh, Jill, that'’s really
not necessary.

11:49.621 --> 11:54.365
Totally uncalled for.
Which one is mine?

11:54.452 --> 11:56.237
Christy?
I can'’t.

11:56.324 --> 11:57.542
You were gonna
rip her off.

11:57.629 --> 11:59.283
You'’re right.

12:08.162 --> 12:10.033
And turn.

12:11.992 --> 12:14.559
If they weren'’t sober
before, they'’re sober now.

12:16.170 --> 12:19.042
Wow! You guys look amazing.

12:19.129 --> 12:21.044
You going out after the meeting?

12:21.131 --> 12:23.830
No, just wanted
to bring a little sexy

12:23.917 --> 12:27.268
to the 7:30
Tuesday night meeting

12:27.355 --> 12:30.010
of Alcoholics Anonymous.

12:30.097 --> 12:31.751
Well, lucky us.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.840
Did you also happen
to bring cookies?

12:33.927 --> 12:36.538
Hello.

12:39.976 --> 12:41.761
Hi. I'’m Christy.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.893
I'’m an alcoholic.

12:43.980 --> 12:45.199
ALL:
Hi, Christy.

12:45.286 --> 12:47.027
I just want to say,

12:47.114 --> 12:51.422
I am getting so much
out of being a sponsor.

12:51.509 --> 12:53.511
Hang on. Let me just...

12:53.598 --> 12:58.081
step out here so I can
feel closer to everybody.

12:58.168 --> 13:00.083
You know how

13:00.170 --> 13:04.435
they say the more you give,
the more you get back?

13:04.522 --> 13:06.481
Well, it'’s true.

13:06.568 --> 13:08.483
I'’m living it.

13:08.570 --> 13:10.441
She'’s wearingit.

13:11.965 --> 13:13.488
And I think the reason that

13:13.575 --> 13:16.621
this works is that
it'’s God'’s will

13:16.708 --> 13:20.147
for us to be
of service,

13:20.234 --> 13:21.975
to help
other people.

13:22.062 --> 13:25.239
And it'’s not just
the less fortunate

13:25.326 --> 13:27.284
who need our help.

13:27.371 --> 13:30.592
Sometimes it'’s the haves
who have not.

13:30.679 --> 13:31.593
Have not!

13:31.680 --> 13:34.204
The main thing is,

13:34.291 --> 13:36.119
I realize now is

13:36.206 --> 13:39.296
that you cannot fix
a spiritual malady

13:39.383 --> 13:40.950
with material stuff.

13:41.037 --> 13:42.952
Stuff!

13:43.039 --> 13:44.432
Keep it down.

13:44.519 --> 13:46.260
Down!

13:48.392 --> 13:51.178
Okay. Uh, well,
I guess that'’s it for me.

13:51.265 --> 13:53.441
I just want to say
how grateful I am,

13:53.528 --> 13:56.574
and, um, thank you all
for help keeping me sober.

13:56.661 --> 13:57.924
[whoops loudly]

13:58.011 --> 13:59.360
[whoops weakly]

14:02.798 --> 14:05.496
Right here-- this is why
I don'’t sponsor people.

14:05.583 --> 14:07.281
That and no one asks you.

14:10.719 --> 14:11.851
She'’s gonna be okay.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.330
Oh, thank God.

14:13.417 --> 14:14.375
They had to pump her stomach.

14:14.462 --> 14:15.855
Ugh.
Ugh.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.378
And they had
to cut her dress off.

14:17.465 --> 14:19.989
Damn, this disease!

14:20.076 --> 14:22.339
[sighs]

14:22.426 --> 14:24.341
This is all my fault.

14:24.428 --> 14:25.995
What are you talking about?

14:26.082 --> 14:27.562
I'’m her sponsor.

14:27.649 --> 14:28.780
So?

14:28.868 --> 14:30.434
So, it'’s my responsibility

14:30.521 --> 14:32.001
to keep her sober.

14:32.088 --> 14:33.002
No, it isn'’t.

14:33.089 --> 14:35.222
Then what the hell am I for?

14:35.309 --> 14:37.528
You tell her
what you do to stay sober,

14:37.615 --> 14:39.617
and then she does
what she'’s gonna do.

14:39.704 --> 14:41.097
That'’s it?

14:41.184 --> 14:42.794
I have nothing
to feel guilty for?

14:42.882 --> 14:44.666
Well, I didn'’t say that.

14:46.450 --> 14:48.017
WOMAN [over P.A.]:
Paging Dr. Davis, telephone.

14:48.104 --> 14:49.453
I'’m Dr. Kendall.

14:49.540 --> 14:50.933
My wife, Jill,
was just admitted.

14:54.763 --> 14:56.721
I get it now.

14:56.808 --> 14:58.810
Big, black,
beautiful things.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.421
Excuse me?

15:00.508 --> 15:02.249
Oh. Nothing.

15:02.336 --> 15:04.033
Uh, um,

15:04.120 --> 15:05.382
Jill'’s okay.

15:05.469 --> 15:07.210
She'’s sleeping now.

15:07.297 --> 15:09.212
Oh, thank God.

15:09.299 --> 15:10.735
Who are you?

15:10.822 --> 15:13.434
Christy Plunkett,
Jill'’s sponsor,

15:13.521 --> 15:17.177
but I'’m not sponsiblefor this.

15:22.051 --> 15:23.792
You'’re not.

15:23.879 --> 15:26.577
She'’s done this before,
more times than I can count.

15:26.664 --> 15:27.927
I'’m so sorry.

15:28.014 --> 15:29.102
Me, too.

15:29.189 --> 15:31.060
She told us about the divorce.

15:31.147 --> 15:33.933
It'’s been coming
for a long time.

15:34.020 --> 15:36.065
I just couldn'’t
put up with it anymore.

15:36.152 --> 15:38.024
Nor should you.

15:43.638 --> 15:46.293
Hi. Bonnie Plunkett.

15:46.380 --> 15:47.859
James Kendall.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.470
Come on, James,
let'’s go to the cafeteria.

15:49.557 --> 15:51.428
I'’ll buy you a cup of coffee,
we'’ll talk.

15:51.515 --> 15:54.127
Thanks. I'’d like that.

16:05.355 --> 16:07.227
[sighs]

16:07.314 --> 16:09.055
Wow.

16:09.142 --> 16:10.970
Jill told me
her husband was a monster.

16:11.057 --> 16:12.319
What do you know?

16:12.406 --> 16:14.408
The drug addict lied.

16:19.891 --> 16:21.850
Oh, God.

16:21.937 --> 16:24.244
Back to hell.

16:24.331 --> 16:26.333
Oh, shut up.
Mom!

16:26.420 --> 16:30.337
What? In an hour, she'’ll be
taking a tennis lesson.

16:30.424 --> 16:34.167
What she means to
say is, good luck.

16:34.254 --> 16:36.517
What she means to say is,
"Take me with you."

16:40.086 --> 16:41.783
Are you disappointed in me?

16:41.870 --> 16:43.828
Are you kidding? No.

16:43.915 --> 16:46.005
I feel like I let you down.

16:46.092 --> 16:49.095
Yeah. I can see that.

16:50.879 --> 16:53.751
Wait. That'’s
not true, either.

16:53.838 --> 16:55.449
No. It'’s okay.

16:55.536 --> 16:57.233
I forgive you.

16:57.320 --> 16:59.018
No, you don'’t get
to forgive me.

16:59.105 --> 17:00.454
BONNIE:
Let it go.

17:00.541 --> 17:02.238
She'’s got more napkin rings
to make.

17:04.371 --> 17:06.286
Can I ask one favor?

17:06.373 --> 17:07.939
Yeah, I guess.

17:08.027 --> 17:11.769
Apparently,
I owe you.

17:11.856 --> 17:13.858
While I'’m stuck in here,

17:13.944 --> 17:17.992
is there any way you'’d consider
house-sitting for me?

17:18.079 --> 17:19.125
BOTH:
Yes!

17:20.604 --> 17:21.561
Got you covered.

17:21.648 --> 17:23.564
Take all the time
you need.

17:23.651 --> 17:25.608
I will.

17:25.695 --> 17:27.307
Love you guys.

17:27.394 --> 17:29.265
Love you, too.
Love you, too.

17:34.618 --> 17:36.490
[car door closes]

17:39.275 --> 17:41.060
[both whoop loudly]

17:41.147 --> 17:42.626
[gasps loudly]

17:42.713 --> 17:44.498
Dibs on the room with
the horny toilet.

17:52.549 --> 17:53.637
[lively, animated music plays]

17:53.724 --> 17:55.596
[chirping on screen]

17:55.683 --> 17:58.294
I can'’t believe you let Roscoe
pick the movie again.

17:58.381 --> 18:00.644
Hey, if you can'’t be grateful,

18:00.731 --> 18:04.170
go take a sauna and come back
with a better attitude.

18:04.257 --> 18:06.737
Tough love. Good.

18:06.824 --> 18:08.696
When Jill gets out of rehab,

18:08.783 --> 18:11.002
we really have
to give her a nice gift

18:11.090 --> 18:12.308
for letting us stay here.

18:12.395 --> 18:14.963
Yeah.

18:15.050 --> 18:16.921
How about a case of wine?

18:20.055 --> 18:23.798
