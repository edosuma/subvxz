03:01.714 --> 03:03.011
Fucking-A.

04:41.380 --> 04:43.075
Yeah, shit is good.

04:43.182 --> 04:45.343
Here. Next time we re-up, though...

04:45.451 --> 04:48.818
tell Moe man we need about 700,
800 more of them dimes, all right?

04:48.921 --> 04:52.118
I ain't even seen shit like this
since I don't know when.

04:52.224 --> 04:55.921
- Same with the jumbos?
- Yeah, better get more of those, too.

05:04.603 --> 05:06.969
What the fuck is up now?
String, what's up, man?

05:07.073 --> 05:08.938
What up? Can't call it.

05:10.476 --> 05:13.570
- How's our package?
- How's it look? Shit is good.

05:15.781 --> 05:18.579
See these Eastside motherfuckers
over here?

05:20.653 --> 05:22.780
I want you to extend
to these motherfuckers...

05:22.888 --> 05:25.448
all the hospitality that
West Baltimore is famous for.

05:25.558 --> 05:28.186
- You heard?
- You want us to fuck them up?

05:28.294 --> 05:29.488
No, dawg.

05:29.895 --> 05:33.797
We're giving them 221, 734, and Saratoga.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.728
We keep the rest. If anybody start any shit...

05:38.471 --> 05:41.599
they'll have to answer to me,
all right? Directly.

05:43.209 --> 05:44.904
You heard me, right?

05:45.745 --> 05:47.007
All right.

05:50.349 --> 05:53.443
What are these off-brand niggers gonna do
with a project tower?

05:53.552 --> 05:54.883
Fall back, young'un.

05:54.987 --> 05:58.718
We're gonna show y'all motherfuckers
how to grind out here, all right?

06:01.093 --> 06:02.492
Hey, String.

06:05.598 --> 06:07.589
I heard you, man, I did.

06:08.300 --> 06:11.428
But this shit right here,
it don't make no sense.

06:11.637 --> 06:14.071
You like the new product we selling?

06:15.040 --> 06:16.667
It make sense now?

06:24.650 --> 06:28.108
- Where are we at with our Boss Man?
- We should be up on his phone soon.

06:28.220 --> 06:32.122
- The PC is there, no question.
- We get up on his cellphone, he's done.

06:32.224 --> 06:33.589
We'll ID him, no problem.

06:33.692 --> 06:37.128
I don't know. They came down on that
warehouse phone when we spooked them.

06:37.229 --> 06:40.665
Sobotka's cellphone, too.
We might be going up on a dead line.

06:40.766 --> 06:42.859
This is the other way to go.

06:43.602 --> 06:46.093
Compared to the wiretap,
it's the longer way around.

06:46.205 --> 06:49.231
But still, if he's changing up
on his cellphone...

06:50.309 --> 06:51.799
Over the last week or so...

06:51.911 --> 06:55.438
we've not only confirmed the identities
of some of the key players...

06:55.548 --> 06:58.176
we've also got GPS trackers
on all their cars.

06:58.284 --> 06:59.808
First of all...

07:01.754 --> 07:05.281
Eton Ben-Eleazer.
He's the drug Lieutenant in the warehouse.

07:05.391 --> 07:07.382
- E-ton.
- Whatever.

07:08.093 --> 07:10.357
Our madam, Miss Ilona Petrovna.

07:11.397 --> 07:14.560
George Glekas, who runs
the appliance store over in Highlandtown...

07:14.667 --> 07:18.626
and the probable fence for the organization.
We followed some of them in real time.

07:18.737 --> 07:22.298
With this little toy here,
there's something else we can do.

07:26.145 --> 07:29.672
That's seven days
of where our targets have been, sped up.

07:29.782 --> 07:31.647
And lookit. Two locations only...

07:31.750 --> 07:35.345
where three or four cars stopped
at the same time for more than five minutes.

07:35.454 --> 07:37.888
One "X" is a dive of a diner
down on South Clinton.

07:37.990 --> 07:41.357
The other is on the western shore
of Fort Howard down past Edgemere.

07:41.460 --> 07:45.055
We get up on these locations,
maybe we get a photo of the Boss Man.

07:45.164 --> 07:46.961
- Or a tag number.
- It's totally cool.

07:47.066 --> 07:50.593
- Where did you even get this stuff?
- DEA for the trackers.

07:50.903 --> 07:54.464
McNulty pulled the software
from his pals at the FBI field office.

07:54.573 --> 07:58.134
We can pull Herc and Carver
off the warehouse and give them the diner.

07:58.244 --> 08:01.179
McNulty, Bunk, you guys take Fort Howard.

08:39.551 --> 08:41.246
What the fuck, Frank?

08:41.520 --> 08:44.353
You might as well
start posting them things, right?

08:44.657 --> 08:48.684
I mean, shit, if you're gonna run,
you might as well come out and say so.

08:55.167 --> 08:56.464
It ain't personal, Ott.

08:56.568 --> 08:59.435
I want to finish what I started
with the dredging issue.

08:59.538 --> 09:02.405
And you don't think I'm good enough
to handle it.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.769
It ain't about that, kiddo.

09:07.546 --> 09:09.480
Ott, listen to me!

09:15.988 --> 09:20.118
What the fuck do you want me to do?
Tell him where the money comes from?

09:22.227 --> 09:23.353
I.B.S.?

09:24.296 --> 09:27.959
Not to brag, but union racketeering
is one thing the Bureau does well.

09:28.067 --> 09:32.834
That is exactly what I wanted to hear.
This case needs closure, boys.

09:33.505 --> 09:35.200
And in my heart of hearts...

09:35.307 --> 09:40.006
I know you're the kind of bastards
to put Sobotka where he needs to be.

09:44.216 --> 09:47.549
One other thing
you Federals can help me with.

09:48.120 --> 09:52.216
And if you don't mind,
a little discretion is called for.

09:53.659 --> 09:57.356
That, right there,
is the district surveillance van...

09:57.463 --> 10:00.330
which was fully equipped
when it disappeared.

10:00.432 --> 10:01.592
A surveillance van?

10:01.700 --> 10:04.726
Sobotka stole it.
Now it's I-don't-know-where.

10:04.837 --> 10:07.271
The last picture was from Seattle...

10:07.373 --> 10:09.841
but I got prints...

10:10.109 --> 10:12.202
from two other places, see?

10:12.711 --> 10:15.145
You reported the van stolen, right?

10:16.215 --> 10:20.845
It was my feeling that the theft
of a vehicle from a departmental lot...

10:20.953 --> 10:23.513
would reflect poorly on the department.

10:24.156 --> 10:27.592
The thing is, I know you boys
have got enough reach...

10:27.693 --> 10:31.390
to maybe get the van back
without no big dustup.

10:33.799 --> 10:37.098
As a favor for me
having brought you the whole case.

10:38.570 --> 10:40.800
Motherfucking Eastside
need to get their asses...

10:40.906 --> 10:43.067
back across town where they belong.

10:43.475 --> 10:46.842
Yo, man, we run them off,
we run off the good dope so...

10:46.945 --> 10:49.971
I'm just saying
they all the time hustling around...

10:50.082 --> 10:52.846
cutting prices and doing shit. It ain't right.

10:56.422 --> 10:57.855
Walk, nigger.

11:01.460 --> 11:03.394
Yo, what's up, soldier?

11:04.763 --> 11:06.331
- Looking maybe to do something here.
- With him? This motherfucker?

11:06.366 --> 11:08.231
- Looking maybe to do something here.
- With him? This motherfucker?

11:08.333 --> 11:11.063
I saw him over on Ashland last week
selling burns.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.365
- Fuck y'all, nigger.
- Look, what did he say?

11:13.472 --> 11:15.633
$25, two dimes and a coke kicker.

11:15.741 --> 11:19.108
I'll give you two dimes for $15,
plus the ice on top for free. What?

11:19.211 --> 11:20.610
That'll work.

11:21.547 --> 11:24.573
Take it in the lobby. I'll be right behind you.

11:24.683 --> 11:26.116
That's what's up, see?

11:26.218 --> 11:29.847
The game now is that we gotta sell
more of this good shit than they do.

11:29.955 --> 11:31.252
What? Get the fuck out of here!

11:31.356 --> 11:33.483
You mean to tell me
there's a Westside nigger...

11:33.592 --> 11:36.993
who knows how to sell shit
without sticking a pistol in a fiend's face?

11:37.096 --> 11:39.087
Yeah, dawg. And you better get used to it...

11:39.198 --> 11:42.395
'cause y'all ain't selling shit
until we bone-ass dry.

11:42.501 --> 11:45.527
- Believe that.
- All right, nigger. Whatever, man.

11:45.704 --> 11:48.832
All right, cottage-cheese,
chest-ass motherfucker.

11:56.048 --> 11:58.812
- Where do you want it?
- There's good.

12:02.087 --> 12:03.349
Easy.

12:06.358 --> 12:10.317
- We could help you set it up.
- You have a surveillance to cover?

12:18.036 --> 12:21.836
- I got that feeling again.
- Like they don't think we're potty trained.

12:23.108 --> 12:26.805
- Can I help you?
- FBI. Lt. Daniels?

12:28.113 --> 12:29.876
He's in his office.

12:32.784 --> 12:35.309
Without that billboard in my face,
I wouldn't have known.

12:35.420 --> 12:37.115
How could you have known?

12:37.956 --> 12:41.517
- There was the wingtips.
- And the beady eyes. Definite giveaway.

12:41.627 --> 12:43.595
- Tight asses.
- Definitely.

12:48.967 --> 12:52.334
Lt. Daniels? Agents Settles and Mason.

12:53.338 --> 12:55.932
Maj. Valchek said you'd be expecting us.

12:58.644 --> 13:00.703
You listening to this fool?

13:00.812 --> 13:04.009
Saying that the Eastside
is wilder than Westside...

13:04.116 --> 13:07.381
'cause of some shit
about Eastside folks drinking port wine...

13:07.486 --> 13:09.579
while the Westside do sherry?

13:09.688 --> 13:13.624
Port make a man do crazy shit,
I'm telling you.

13:13.725 --> 13:17.991
- Butchie, talk to this fool.
- For me, leastways...

13:18.096 --> 13:21.429
the difference between East and West
goes back to one man:

13:21.533 --> 13:23.797
- Frank Matthews.
- Pee Wee Matthews?

13:23.902 --> 13:27.895
Yeah, the brother went up New York
and got in bed with them Italians.

13:28.006 --> 13:31.237
The only one from this town
got a piece of that French Connection.

13:31.343 --> 13:33.334
What the hell Pee Wee
got to do with anything?

13:33.445 --> 13:37.643
'Cause Frank was Westside. How do you
like that? The dope flowed West.

13:37.749 --> 13:41.810
When you got a steady supply,
you run shit like a business.

13:41.920 --> 13:46.550
Somebody gets hurt, there's a reason.
Not like this foolishness we got today.

13:48.594 --> 13:49.959
Excuse me.

13:52.698 --> 13:54.359
What say, Omar?

13:55.167 --> 13:56.725
Ain't no thing.

13:57.336 --> 14:02.000
You know I got something for you, right?
Wouldn't come around unless I did.

14:05.444 --> 14:07.537
What up, Butch?
How you holding up, baby?

14:07.646 --> 14:10.240
Except for fretting on you, I'm good.

14:14.086 --> 14:15.951
It's for my people.

14:25.230 --> 14:27.721
A little something for a rainy day.

14:31.470 --> 14:34.803
You built up a right nice-size nest
these past couple of years.

14:34.906 --> 14:37.841
Might be time you maybe think
about backing off some?

14:38.777 --> 14:40.472
Back off to what?

14:42.547 --> 14:44.037
Later, Butch.

14:45.384 --> 14:46.681
Stay, boy.

15:23.889 --> 15:26.289
Damn, Zig, I ain't got it cut yet.

15:27.959 --> 15:30.792
And turn that shit down, for Christ's sake.

15:56.054 --> 15:57.988
Nicely done.

15:58.090 --> 16:01.116
Like I always say,
it pays to go with a union card every time.

16:01.226 --> 16:05.094
- Turn the fucking radio down, Zig.
- Will you get in the goddamn car already?

16:05.197 --> 16:08.257
For Christ's sake,
we ain't got all night. Jesus!

16:12.270 --> 16:15.933
You could drive a tank through there,
it wouldn't take a scratch.

16:22.180 --> 16:24.410
Where the fuck you going with this?

16:24.516 --> 16:26.950
Greece. Athens, Greece.

16:28.520 --> 16:31.421
The hole is so they don't think
it's an inside job.

16:31.990 --> 16:34.083
So they don't look at the union.

16:34.192 --> 16:35.955
Welcome aboard, chief.

17:35.454 --> 17:37.012
Is that you?

17:40.625 --> 17:42.855
I thought you were gonna go shopping.

17:44.062 --> 17:46.690
- Me?
- Yeah.

17:47.132 --> 17:49.464
We round-the-clock with surveillance.

17:51.436 --> 17:54.769
When do we get to the part
where you do all kind of shit for me?

17:54.873 --> 17:57.000
When do we get to that part?

17:57.442 --> 18:01.003
So you past the point
of lifting a grocery bag or two?

18:02.547 --> 18:04.981
You try being me like this.

18:22.801 --> 18:24.359
Something wrong?

18:34.312 --> 18:37.110
The baby's kicking. Wanna feel?

18:58.470 --> 19:01.633
- Almost $4,000.
- I know it is.

19:02.340 --> 19:05.776
The Greek guy, the one with the warehouse,
pays me in cash.

19:06.344 --> 19:09.472
Keeps it off the books,
so he don't have to pay taxes and benefits.

19:09.581 --> 19:13.381
- And you saved all that?
- He gave me a bump, too.

19:13.718 --> 19:15.845
I'm pulling down $700 a week.

19:17.522 --> 19:19.285
You don't believe me?

19:22.561 --> 19:23.721
Christ.

19:25.397 --> 19:28.889
I was saving that up to give to you
for the new apartment.

20:02.601 --> 20:04.660
You know what I'm saying, dawg?

20:04.769 --> 20:08.136
But I don't understand how these hoes
be acting sometimes and shit.

20:08.239 --> 20:12.073
If I tell a bitch, I'm like,
"Bitch, either you suck dick or you don't."

20:12.177 --> 20:15.510
- Gentlemen.
- What's up, my brother?

20:16.581 --> 20:20.073
Are you slinging bean pies up in here?
You know what I mean?

20:20.785 --> 20:23.754
You with the nation, homey?
'Cause either you're a Muslim...

20:23.855 --> 20:27.689
or your momma need to stop
laying your clothes out in the morning.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.888
I'm here to represent the interests
of a Mr. Barksdale.

20:31.997 --> 20:36.434
- Are you familiar with Mr. Barksdale?
- That name ring out, but so do mine.

20:36.635 --> 20:38.102
And you are?

20:39.704 --> 20:41.228
Cheese, man.

20:41.339 --> 20:43.273
Mr. Cheese. I see.

20:44.075 --> 20:47.704
- And who do you work for, Mr. Cheese?
- Who do I work for?

20:47.812 --> 20:51.270
Am I correct in assuming that
you are not employed by Mr. Barksdale?

20:51.383 --> 20:52.441
Hell, yeah.

20:52.550 --> 20:56.145
If that is the case,
then I have to insist that you leave.

20:56.921 --> 20:59.685
- This nigger serious?
- Let me be emphatic.

20:59.791 --> 21:03.192
You need to take your black ass
across Charles Street to where it belong.

21:03.294 --> 21:05.057
- What?
- Hold on now.

21:06.398 --> 21:10.129
He don't know what this is. It ain't
what he think, you know what I'm saying?

21:10.235 --> 21:14.535
First of all, we got permission
to grind in these here towers.

21:14.939 --> 21:17.203
Second of all, I don't give a fuck...

21:22.514 --> 21:24.141
Get off me, get off!

21:25.684 --> 21:28.585
Pellets in plastic. Rat shot.

21:29.487 --> 21:33.890
What you need to be concerned about
is what's seated in the chamber now:

21:33.992 --> 21:35.516
a copper-jacketed, hollow point...

21:35.627 --> 21:38.926
120-grain hot street load
of my own creation.

21:39.030 --> 21:43.194
So you need to think for just a moment
and ask yourself:

21:44.202 --> 21:48.434
What do I have to do
before this man raise up his gun again?

21:50.809 --> 21:52.106
Let's go.

21:54.579 --> 21:56.513
Good day to you, sir.

22:05.523 --> 22:08.048
I'm in agreement
with the agents' assessment.

22:08.159 --> 22:09.490
As far as I can see...

22:09.594 --> 22:12.222
this case is an ideal candidate
for RICO prosecution.

22:12.330 --> 22:16.767
My agency agrees RICO is the way to go,
so we'll be in your courthouse, not mine.

22:16.868 --> 22:18.563
But I want one thing on record.

22:18.670 --> 22:22.231
As of 9/11,
the Bureau has one priority in this case:

22:22.474 --> 22:24.101
it's waterfront corruption.

22:24.209 --> 22:26.871
It's a new world
and the ports are vulnerable.

22:26.978 --> 22:28.468
This case is bigger than the union.

22:28.580 --> 22:31.071
We're agreeing to take on
the whole case, Lieutenant.

22:31.182 --> 22:34.174
But the union is why
we're in the room with you.

22:34.285 --> 22:37.721
If you're okay with that,
we can work the case together.

22:44.028 --> 22:47.623
We'll copy all the Bureau's 302s
to the Lieutenant and Miss Pearlman.

22:47.732 --> 22:50.701
Your paperwork should CC Squad 6
and my office, as well.

22:51.636 --> 22:54.366
I'll start pumping your casework
into our system.

22:54.472 --> 22:56.963
See what leads that might generate.

23:02.981 --> 23:05.245
Oughtn't you be laid up resting?

23:05.617 --> 23:08.177
A gunshot ain't nothing to trifle with.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.278
Shoulder do hurt.

23:14.159 --> 23:16.389
But this here work just fine.

23:17.595 --> 23:21.224
Tell Stack to polish it up good
and put $7.50 on it.

23:21.633 --> 23:25.262
Shame to let a good toaster get away
over a frayed cord.

23:29.007 --> 23:32.067
First off, ain't nobody running
up in them projects.

23:32.177 --> 23:35.510
Them Westside boys are hurting over this
more than even you.

23:35.613 --> 23:39.276
Trust me,
soon as our good shit run out, they fucked.

23:39.551 --> 23:43.317
Second, a whole passel of hard-ass hitters...

23:43.421 --> 23:47.187
took a go at Brother Mouzone,
and ain't lived to say shit about it.

23:47.292 --> 23:50.159
We go at the boy,
no telling what might get stirred up.

23:50.261 --> 23:53.992
If Stringer takes a shot,
he crosses Avon on it.

23:54.098 --> 23:55.497
Put a bounty on him.

23:55.600 --> 23:58.125
Let some bushwhacking fiend
back-shoot his ass.

23:58.236 --> 24:01.171
I pin money on him,
and first thing he come at me?

24:01.372 --> 24:05.365
Shit. Might as well just shoot myself now
and get it over.

24:10.048 --> 24:13.540
There is one boy
who might could just pull this off.

24:13.718 --> 24:16.152
Only, he won't take contract money.

24:46.551 --> 24:49.645
Aim for center mass.
Make sure the man goes down.

24:50.755 --> 24:52.154
No problem.

24:52.824 --> 24:54.951
I got the three on the left.

24:58.263 --> 24:59.958
Fuck you, assholes.

25:04.002 --> 25:05.833
- How you doing?
- How you doing, buddy?

25:06.004 --> 25:08.199
The Samsung S221. You got that?

25:09.140 --> 25:10.664
I don't see it.

25:16.547 --> 25:18.742
Doing the old inventory, are we?

25:18.850 --> 25:21.819
I hope there ain't been no thieving going on.

25:22.186 --> 25:24.746
Not like the problem we got
down at the docks.

25:24.856 --> 25:28.724
- You get the cars off?
- Sailed two hours ago on the Caspia.

25:28.826 --> 25:31.795
Listed as scrap aluminum.
I got the bill of lading right here.

25:31.896 --> 25:33.227
Not here.

25:34.699 --> 25:36.064
In my office.

25:40.905 --> 25:43.897
Forgive me, but how am I to know...

25:44.008 --> 25:46.568
you did not ship them empty?

25:46.678 --> 25:48.771
I just don't know. Let me see.

25:48.880 --> 25:53.817
Maybe if I had a 4.0 Megapix,
three time optical, fully digitalized camera...

25:54.218 --> 25:57.984
I could've taken some quality photos
of them Benzes in those cans.

25:58.389 --> 26:01.654
But oops. I forgot my camera got busted.

26:01.759 --> 26:03.693
Or you know what I could do?

26:03.795 --> 26:06.593
I could get old Boris
to skulk around them docks...

26:06.698 --> 26:08.928
keep the old commie red eye
on them containers.

26:09.033 --> 26:11.263
Make sure the dock boys
are playing me straight.

26:11.369 --> 26:12.961
- They are what I order?
- Yes.

26:13.071 --> 26:15.972
I got you the S series
in the colors that you wanted.

26:16.074 --> 26:18.167
I even got one parked outside.
You wanna see?

26:18.276 --> 26:20.244
Outside? Now?

26:20.345 --> 26:24.611
I'm just taking her out for a spin, chief.
I'll put her back tonight.

26:42.734 --> 26:43.996
Wait one.

26:45.536 --> 26:48.403
Them cars list out
at better than $60,000 each.

26:48.506 --> 26:52.169
20% was last week. Today, the quote is 10%.

26:53.144 --> 26:56.705
Still, it's good money for a few hours' work.

26:56.814 --> 26:58.543
No!

26:58.649 --> 27:03.484
No fucking way!
We had a deal, motherfucker. A deal.

27:04.455 --> 27:05.820
You listen to me.

27:05.923 --> 27:08.653
It was my fucking ass out there
on the line. Mine.

27:08.760 --> 27:12.127
This piddling shit
is the best that you come up with?

27:12.296 --> 27:14.730
You don't play me like that. You don't.

27:26.244 --> 27:30.613
Fuck you, you thieving, Greek cunt.

27:30.715 --> 27:31.909
Malaka!

27:39.924 --> 27:42.620
You don't know that one, chief.
But you know "malaka, " yes?

27:42.727 --> 27:45.025
Now you know malaka with dress.

28:59.937 --> 29:01.199
Please.

29:06.310 --> 29:07.470
Malaka.

29:17.522 --> 29:19.080
Can you hear me?

29:19.457 --> 29:21.721
If you can talk, please stay on the line.

30:57.588 --> 31:00.056
Get in the boat first,
then put the preserver on.

31:00.157 --> 31:02.318
- It's easier that way.
- Yeah?

31:03.027 --> 31:05.689
Y'all trying to drown my ass for sure.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.795
- Come on.
- Don't push me, man.

31:20.611 --> 31:21.942
Rod.

31:24.482 --> 31:25.471
Got it.

31:26.884 --> 31:29.318
Here. Hold on to that.

31:31.322 --> 31:33.153
I know this one.

31:47.838 --> 31:50.432
Stringer Bell will come at me with this.

31:51.042 --> 31:54.307
Says he's got something with Omar
he need to make straight.

31:55.212 --> 31:57.407
Didn't say what that might be?

31:57.948 --> 32:02.044
Wouldn't tell me.
And to be truthful, I didn't want to know.

32:07.491 --> 32:09.391
No. It don't feel right.

32:09.493 --> 32:12.360
You know them Barksdale people
ain't to be trusted.

32:12.463 --> 32:16.900
No denying all you say is true.
But Stringer talking parley.

32:17.535 --> 32:20.368
So your boy needs to think
long and hard on this.

32:20.471 --> 32:23.907
'Cause if Omar is living his day-to-day
in the street...

32:24.008 --> 32:28.001
there ain't no telling what their next step
might be if there ain't no sit-down.

32:28.112 --> 32:31.104
- "Parley"?
- That's all he says he's looking for.

32:35.319 --> 32:36.911
I'll talk to him.

32:38.422 --> 32:41.186
But if it feels funny to him
the way it does to me...

32:41.292 --> 32:44.887
I got a better chance
of putting a leash to the wind, you know?

32:45.229 --> 32:49.461
If you think it might help,
I can go protection.

32:50.034 --> 32:54.027
- They're the one got hurt the last time.
- Then there was a reason to meet.

32:55.806 --> 32:59.173
- This time feel different.
- I hear you.

33:00.010 --> 33:03.036
Maybe Stringer's still trying
to settle that beef...

33:03.147 --> 33:06.014
behind the fact
that he got to live in this city, too...

33:06.751 --> 33:08.912
Omar being Omar.

33:10.921 --> 33:13.412
If it ain't putting you out none...

33:13.524 --> 33:17.426
I'd feel a powerful lot better
if my nephew took over protection.

33:20.498 --> 33:21.726
Hayward.

33:32.643 --> 33:35.806
Typed and ready for your John Hancock.

33:44.588 --> 33:46.146
- Thanks.
- Sure.

34:04.975 --> 34:09.172
You just have to initial each page
and then sign at the end.

34:11.315 --> 34:15.251
I'm just checking.
This is the official record, right, chief?

34:17.021 --> 34:19.353
It's what's gonna play in court.

34:21.759 --> 34:23.818
Can I change something?

34:27.130 --> 34:28.188
Yeah.

34:33.304 --> 34:37.070
Just put your initials next to your changes.
It's no problem.

34:38.141 --> 34:39.609
Yeah, it's only one.

34:39.710 --> 34:44.170
- You know, you typed "said" here, see?
- "Said"?

34:52.188 --> 34:55.056
He wasn't saying, "Please don't shoot me."

34:56.827 --> 34:58.692
It was more begging.

35:01.398 --> 35:05.732
You know? Double G, he's begging me.

35:07.738 --> 35:10.468
But that's not gonna mess you up,
though, right?

35:13.477 --> 35:16.913
No, it's more descriptive like that.
It's good. Thanks.

35:42.940 --> 35:45.238
Quiet. No one in or out of there.

36:00.791 --> 36:04.090
It's kind of nice out here.
Moonlight on the water.

36:04.428 --> 36:07.727
Waves lapping gently against the boat.

36:11.936 --> 36:15.497
I'm working my regular eight.
I can handle it, you know?

36:15.973 --> 36:18.032
But a detail like this...

36:20.244 --> 36:22.075
That's what I'm asking.

36:22.179 --> 36:25.774
If something comes up on the job,
how would you handle it?

36:26.684 --> 36:28.879
I mean, at home with the kids.

36:29.920 --> 36:32.081
Until now, not much came up.

36:32.623 --> 36:35.558
But now, say something comes up.

36:36.327 --> 36:40.388
I mean, say we do a raid or something.
What would you do?

36:41.999 --> 36:44.763
I guess I'd try to get the sitter to stay.

36:44.868 --> 36:47.462
Maybe call my folks, like I did tonight.

36:48.138 --> 36:51.232
You know how it is with kids.
You gotta be there.

36:51.976 --> 36:53.534
But you wouldn't miss it?

36:53.644 --> 36:58.274
I mean, with everybody rolling out
and you having to head home?

37:00.884 --> 37:04.581
If it keeps going like this,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

37:09.893 --> 37:11.918
- Thanks.
- It's no problem.

37:12.663 --> 37:15.029
You wanna make a phone call to someone?

37:15.499 --> 37:19.401
If you get over to Madison,
it might be some time before you can.

37:19.536 --> 37:22.027
Ain't a chance I get a bail, right?

37:28.012 --> 37:29.707
How about family?

37:41.558 --> 37:45.460
All right, to bring you up to speed,
we've got agents in Le Havre...

37:45.562 --> 37:49.498
shagging leads from the manifest
of the Talco ship due here in a few days.

37:49.600 --> 37:52.660
To see if we can't pinpoint the origin
for the illegal containers.

37:52.770 --> 37:54.499
That's a lot of cans.

37:54.605 --> 37:57.039
A hundred and ten, actually.

37:57.241 --> 38:01.302
How many agents you need to track back
to where all those cans came from?

38:01.412 --> 38:03.107
As many as it takes.

38:04.682 --> 38:09.278
We may be assholes, but on the upside,
there's an awful lot of us.

38:10.788 --> 38:14.246
Let me get this into the computer
for the boys overseas.

38:18.862 --> 38:21.422
Anything from that shithole of a diner?

38:21.965 --> 38:24.195
Herc and Carver had nothing overnight.

38:24.301 --> 38:27.464
The feds took over this morning
and it's still quiet.

38:27.571 --> 38:29.664
I'm going back on the water.

38:31.341 --> 38:33.468
One meet and we're on this guy.

39:11.682 --> 39:15.516
The Talco line's in Wednesday.
I'll send Nick for a number.

39:16.453 --> 39:18.785
- The Greeks again?
- Who else?

39:19.456 --> 39:22.220
They sure do stir up the shit,
them Greeks do.

39:24.962 --> 39:28.693
- Uncle Frank.
- Nicky boy, just in time.

39:28.799 --> 39:31.632
- Uncle Frank.
- What? What happened?

39:33.504 --> 39:36.302
- What the fuck is it this time?
- He shot...

39:37.674 --> 39:40.370
They're saying he shot two of the Greeks.

39:40.611 --> 39:43.079
- Last night, they're saying.
- Shot?

39:43.647 --> 39:46.172
- He shot?
- Fucking Christ!

39:46.283 --> 39:50.219
He's locked up.
He's fucking charged with murder.

39:50.320 --> 39:52.550
- The Greeks?
- Double G.

39:52.990 --> 39:56.391
And one of the kids that works
down the store on the avenue with him.

39:56.493 --> 39:58.620
They're saying he walked in there.

39:58.729 --> 40:01.095
- He went in.
- Why was he there?

40:01.365 --> 40:04.163
- Where the fuck were you?
- Uncle Frank, I didn't know.

40:04.268 --> 40:05.758
What didn't you know?

40:05.869 --> 40:09.100
- What is Ziggy doing near the Greeks?
- I don't know.

40:09.206 --> 40:12.901
You don't know? You're supposed to.
You're his fucking cousin!

40:13.610 --> 40:15.202
You're his father.

40:25.956 --> 40:28.049
1,125 kilograms.

40:28.559 --> 40:30.891
Not that drug enforcement's my cup of tea...

40:30.994 --> 40:34.452
but I'm told
it was the largest crack seizure on record.

40:36.333 --> 40:38.665
I just wish I had good news for you.

40:40.571 --> 40:43.062
You told me this was a local effort.

40:43.173 --> 40:47.610
It's sprawled. Now the Bureau's involved.
We're looking hard at the port unions.

40:47.711 --> 40:49.372
My hands are tied.

40:52.816 --> 40:55.011
They're on you with wiretaps.

40:55.419 --> 40:57.853
Several phones, several addresses.

41:15.706 --> 41:17.037
Stefanos.

41:24.815 --> 41:26.749
Have the boy go to Eton.

41:26.850 --> 41:29.114
Tell him to come right away
to the other place.

41:29.219 --> 41:32.484
- You're not calling?
- No phones. No more phones.

41:35.192 --> 41:36.557
Adieu, my friend.

41:47.804 --> 41:49.635
They forgot your fries.

41:50.007 --> 41:52.168
No, they forgot your fries.

41:52.276 --> 41:55.507
- My fries are right in here.
- Those are my fries.

41:56.146 --> 42:00.139
Bitch, everything I say, you hear backwards.
The fries are mine, boy.

42:02.786 --> 42:04.048
Go ahead.

42:04.154 --> 42:07.180
Eat the fries, you fat fuck.
See if I fucking care.

42:07.291 --> 42:10.055
What? You think I'm fat?

42:18.201 --> 42:19.862
There's our boy.

42:22.239 --> 42:25.231
- Lester, Eton's on the move.
- We got it.

42:26.043 --> 42:29.535
- No need for an eyeball follow, right?
- No need.

42:30.080 --> 42:32.275
A fine fucking kettle of fish.

42:32.883 --> 42:36.011
I heard it,
but I had to come see it for myself.

42:36.386 --> 42:38.911
- And sure enough...
- Major?

42:39.957 --> 42:43.017
You know,
I put my faith in you fucking feds.

42:44.027 --> 42:45.688
You let me down.

42:46.063 --> 42:49.294
- Major, we can talk in my office.
- Lieutenant.

42:50.500 --> 42:52.331
It's Lieutenant, right?

42:52.869 --> 42:55.133
I gave you a simple assignment:

42:55.339 --> 42:58.365
that fellow, the one in the corner.

42:59.343 --> 43:02.244
And to make it happen, I gave you all this.

43:03.547 --> 43:05.947
Good digs, people...

43:06.616 --> 43:08.550
everything you needed.

43:09.019 --> 43:10.919
And what did you give me?

43:11.154 --> 43:14.646
Right up the fucking ass, Lieutenant.

43:15.058 --> 43:18.255
- Major, you're going to get --
- Roland, get your shit.

43:18.595 --> 43:20.688
You want to do it your way, fine.

43:20.864 --> 43:23.799
But you ain't gonna use my people
to fuck me.

43:26.803 --> 43:30.796
- Get your gear. I'm pulling you.
- I got... There's work...

43:31.375 --> 43:34.674
- You said --
- Get your narrow ass back to the district...

43:34.778 --> 43:37.508
before I slap you with insubordination.

43:39.149 --> 43:40.844
Move, shitbird!

43:44.488 --> 43:45.750
Jesus!

44:06.209 --> 44:09.372
Detective, my office.

44:51.955 --> 44:55.391
Base to 11-34.
Target number two is coming at your 20.

44:55.625 --> 44:57.786
Copy that. We're on it good.

45:08.071 --> 45:09.732
We're on the Boss.

45:10.707 --> 45:11.969
My God.

45:12.943 --> 45:16.811
- He shoots both?
- He kills George, right there in the store.

45:17.481 --> 45:20.450
- Leaves the boy to bleed.
- For what?

45:22.452 --> 45:24.613
An argument over a few cars?

45:25.422 --> 45:28.118
- That little Polack?
- He's crazy, that one.

45:29.159 --> 45:31.093
The police have him now.

45:35.532 --> 45:37.397
The police still there?

45:39.202 --> 45:40.794
Go to the store.

45:41.538 --> 45:45.065
Whatever the police did not take,
papers, pictures, everything...

45:45.175 --> 45:46.802
you clean it up.

45:48.411 --> 45:51.437
The warehouse, too.
Everything gets clean now.

45:54.217 --> 45:55.616
Everything.

45:57.154 --> 45:59.122
And the phones are dead.

46:04.928 --> 46:07.829
Did you see that?
They just threw the phones.

46:09.466 --> 46:11.491
11-34 to Surveillance.

46:12.035 --> 46:14.367
- Standing by.
- We got our man.

46:14.471 --> 46:18.100
Target number one
is a white male, 40s, short...

46:18.208 --> 46:21.075
wearing a tan shirt and a gray tam.

46:21.845 --> 46:23.710
Copy your description.

46:25.081 --> 46:27.743
11-34 to Surveillance,
both targets are on the move.

46:27.851 --> 46:30.479
We can't make the vehicle from here,
but you sure can.

46:30.587 --> 46:31.576
Copy.

46:31.688 --> 46:34.282
What was he doing
with that thing in his hand?

46:35.158 --> 46:37.092
Same thing you always do.

46:37.527 --> 46:41.293
Probably sending a text message.
My kids are crazy over that.

46:57.714 --> 46:59.579
That's our guy, right?

47:00.250 --> 47:03.242
What's his face Sobotka
from the drug corner?

47:11.928 --> 47:13.987
I need to get with Vondas.

47:14.564 --> 47:15.929
Who's that?

47:21.438 --> 47:24.407
Spiros. Where is he?

47:25.508 --> 47:27.476
I don't know no Spiros.

47:44.694 --> 47:47.527
- No shit.
- He just up and clocked him?

47:47.631 --> 47:50.964
- Daniels had everybody write what they saw.
- Even us suits.

47:51.067 --> 47:53.194
That was smart. Daniels is sharp.

47:53.336 --> 47:55.930
- Where's Prez now?
- Daniels took him home.

47:56.039 --> 47:59.167
- I don't think he'll come back to this detail.
- You never know.

47:59.276 --> 48:02.734
He might have one of those psychological
bullshit things in his jacket...

48:02.846 --> 48:05.110
gives him immunity or something.

48:05.215 --> 48:09.015
Valchek gave him immunity,
and he just put Valchek on his ass.

48:12.922 --> 48:16.790
- Nothing since the Fort Howard meet.
- They're definitely dumping phones.

48:21.965 --> 48:26.061
When you use a cellphone and
press "send, " where does the call go to?

48:26.169 --> 48:28.831
- Why are you asking?
- The Boss Man at Fort Howard.

48:28.938 --> 48:31.270
He tosses the cellphone we're up on, right?

48:31.374 --> 48:35.105
Then he pulls out another thingamajig,
and he types a message.

48:35.211 --> 48:36.735
Text messaging.

48:38.214 --> 48:42.014
It starts at one of those towers
they got up all over the place, right?

48:42.118 --> 48:44.882
And ends up in a computer
at a wireless provider.

48:44.988 --> 48:49.288
If you knew when the call was made,
could you trace the call back to that tower?

48:49.559 --> 48:51.993
'Cause if you could,
mightn't you get a phone number?

48:52.095 --> 48:54.586
You get that,
then you got the billing details, right?

48:54.698 --> 48:57.724
Fool, do you have any idea
how many people use cellphones?

48:57.834 --> 49:01.326
There must be thousands,
hundreds of thousands at any time.

49:01.438 --> 49:03.736
What you need is another variable.

49:03.840 --> 49:08.004
Another bit of data that's gonna help you
isolate your call from all the others.

49:08.111 --> 49:12.343
What if you knew where the call was made?
I mean, exactly where it was made.

49:13.183 --> 49:16.949
We were out in the middle of nowhere.
Does that help narrow it down?

49:17.053 --> 49:21.353
The Fort Howard sea wall. It ain't exactly
Charles and Baltimore Streets.

49:21.458 --> 49:24.689
You've got another problem.
Which wireless company?

49:24.794 --> 49:28.821
There must be Verizon, MCI, AT&T, Sprint...

49:29.265 --> 49:32.166
Shit, tin cans and a string.
You got dozens of them.

49:40.577 --> 49:41.942
Lamar?

49:42.912 --> 49:45.278
- Where's my Harper's?
- Say what?

49:45.382 --> 49:46.940
Harper's. The new issue.

49:47.050 --> 49:50.144
You didn't say that one.
You said The New Republic and Atlantic...

49:50.253 --> 49:53.313
- And a new something else.
- I did not forget to tell you Harper's.

49:53.423 --> 49:57.917
Every week I tell you the same shit,
and every week you forget half of what I say.

49:58.027 --> 50:01.656
Tomorrow, first thing, you go
to the newsstand and you get Harper's.

50:01.765 --> 50:05.223
And The Nation, too,
which you also managed to forget.

50:07.036 --> 50:10.494
You know what the most dangerous thing
in America is, right?

50:12.542 --> 50:14.635
A nigger with a library card.

50:17.180 --> 50:20.672
All damn day, he just sit there reading.

50:21.951 --> 50:24.749
And damned if them Eastside bitches
don't stay away.

50:24.854 --> 50:27.687
- That's real muscle, right there.
- True that.

50:28.825 --> 50:32.317
What are we gonna do
when we start running out of good product?

50:32.695 --> 50:34.754
That's what we need to ask ourselves.

50:34.864 --> 50:38.322
Yo, Bodie,
if Stringer want the Eastside up in here...

50:38.735 --> 50:41.670
then why Barksdale got a man
running them off?

50:52.081 --> 50:55.847
This is getting us nowhere.
We got nothing under Pyramid Inc...

50:55.952 --> 50:58.580
or any of the targets
at any other cellular company.

50:58.688 --> 51:00.178
It's on McNulty then.

51:00.957 --> 51:03.084
11-35, you got the 20?

51:03.193 --> 51:06.060
- I'm on the spot right now.
- Go.

51:06.763 --> 51:11.132
10-4. Latitude first:
North, 39 degrees. 11.727.

51:11.568 --> 51:15.766
Longitude: West, 76 degrees. 26.628.

51:18.541 --> 51:22.170
Now, this was a neat trick.
No one ever did it before.

51:22.612 --> 51:25.342
Identified a cellphone using time and GPS.

51:25.448 --> 51:28.212
We got everything on the phone
that was text messaging...

51:28.318 --> 51:31.253
from those coordinates at 04:45 p.m. today.

51:36.893 --> 51:38.224
Just a subpoena?

51:38.328 --> 51:42.094
With this, you can get account information
and a phone number.

51:42.198 --> 51:43.722
With a search warrant...

51:43.833 --> 51:47.462
you can get two months of text messages.

51:48.371 --> 51:51.101
You got two months of text messages
in this file?

51:51.207 --> 51:53.334
I do, if you've got a warrant.

51:55.144 --> 51:56.668
Tell you what, friend.

51:56.779 --> 51:59.976
We're gonna go back and
start typing that warrant tomorrow morning.

52:00.083 --> 52:02.483
But right now,
we wouldn't mind taking a peek...

52:02.585 --> 52:04.917
at what my man's been up to
in the last 24 hours.

52:05.021 --> 52:06.818
Exigent circumstances.

52:11.160 --> 52:12.718
Thanks, brother.

52:17.800 --> 52:19.097
Fuck me.

52:21.671 --> 52:23.229
Nothing's easy.

52:26.543 --> 52:29.637
- What's up?
- They've dumped their phones.

52:30.413 --> 52:33.541
We're trying to get onto
the Boss Man's text messaging.

52:35.184 --> 52:37.448
They sent that Greek mess over as email.

52:37.554 --> 52:40.148
After he inputs,
the computer will translate it.

52:40.256 --> 52:41.280
Got it.

52:44.494 --> 52:45.756
Shit.

53:00.043 --> 53:01.510
Hey, Prissy.

53:03.246 --> 53:05.111
Thought you'd be here.

53:29.572 --> 53:31.062
Fucking Ziggy.

53:31.941 --> 53:34.068
When didn't he do dumb shit?

53:35.211 --> 53:38.374
Remember when he forged
that Age of Majority card?

53:40.883 --> 53:42.783
We all pooled our money.

53:43.086 --> 53:45.646
You drove us over Brooklyn Park
to the cut-rate.

53:45.755 --> 53:47.848
My mom's puke-yellow Chevy.

53:48.958 --> 53:50.926
We told him specifically:

53:51.194 --> 53:53.526
two bottles of Pikesville Rye and...

53:56.299 --> 53:58.233
Southern Comfort for me.

54:03.306 --> 54:05.137
What did fucknuts get?

54:07.110 --> 54:09.010
Fucking Boone's Farm.

54:13.716 --> 54:16.514
He said that's what the college kids drank.

54:17.286 --> 54:20.050
But we did it up. Right here.

54:26.629 --> 54:30.087
He stood up there, a bottle in each hand...

54:31.567 --> 54:34.263
screaming loud enough to wake the nuns.

54:36.506 --> 54:38.474
What the fuck did he say?

54:50.353 --> 54:53.015
"College kids ain't shit!"

55:19.916 --> 55:21.406
Goddamn, Zig.

55:40.670 --> 55:43.230
- Yeah?
- Beadie, it's Kima.

55:44.640 --> 55:46.665
We're gonna take the Boss out.

55:46.776 --> 55:50.769
- Raids? Tonight?
- You got somewhere to drop the kids off?

55:50.880 --> 55:54.372
No, no problem.
I can take them over to my parents'.

55:55.752 --> 55:57.743
All right, we'll see you soon.

55:57.854 --> 56:01.017
Kima, thanks for the call. Bye.

56:13.035 --> 56:15.663
The judge wants to know how much longer.

56:15.772 --> 56:16.966
We're close.

56:24.514 --> 56:27.881
Dump this row. Dump the computer.
Dump this.
