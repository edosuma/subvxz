He's on the way, Mack.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.599
I'm droppin' him right in your lap.

01:27.600 --> 01:29.159
Copy that. We're all set up.

It's the little things, you know,
that I'm still trying to get used to.

01:54.320 --> 01:57.599
Like, if I drop my napkin... Ow.
...in a restaurant,

01:57.600 --> 01:59.919
Alex gives me his.

01:59.920 --> 02:02.039
Car door needs
opening, he opens it.

02:02.040 --> 02:04.679
My neighbors, abusive?
He yells at them.

02:04.680 --> 02:08.725
The other night, we were watching
a video, he let me pick it out.

- All right.

02:21.320 --> 02:24.399
My last boyfriend, Jack, wasn't
exactly the romantic type.

02:24.400 --> 02:26.199
Two years ago, for my birthday...

02:26.200 --> 02:27.719
He gives me pepper Spray.

02:27.720 --> 02:29.079
I think it's perfume.

02:29.080 --> 02:31.559
I end up in the emergency room.

02:48.560 --> 02:50.599
Alex is so completely different.

02:50.600 --> 02:53.759

he works beach patrol.</i>

03:50.440 --> 03:53.519
That's how we met, by the way.
I was, uh, jaywalking.

03:53.520 --> 03:54.959
- Jaywalking, huh?
- Yeah.

03:54.960 --> 03:57.199
Well, you know,
jaywalking is a crime.

03:57.200 --> 03:58.999

- It's our anniversary tonight.
- Yeah?

04:12.200 --> 04:13.839
- (SIREN WAILING)
- Seven months.

04:13.840 --> 04:15.319
Neither one of us has
ever dated longer.

04:15.320 --> 04:16.759
That's why we're celebrating...

04:16.760 --> 04:18.399
Look, why don't you slow down

04:18.399 --> 04:20.879
and tell me your
problem, huh? Good.

04:20.880 --> 04:22.964
Uh, make a left here.

reasonable explanation...

You're a madman, Shaw!

06:54.840 --> 06:56.759
Nice working with you, as always.

06:56.760 --> 06:59.399
So far, they've recovered
some of the stolen computers

06:59.400 --> 07:01.319

thanks mainly to SWAT
team member Alex Shaw

07:04.080 --> 07:07.199
who was the officer injured
in today's high-speed chase.

07:07.200 --> 07:09.359

07:10.600 --> 07:13.839
You never said that you were
on the suicide squad, ever.

07:13.840 --> 07:16.519
You knew that I was a cop.
I said that I was...

07:16.520 --> 07:18.160
Wait.

07:18.840 --> 07:20.839
Oh, Come on. Ow.

07:20.840 --> 07:21.999
Let me ask you.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.719
When I had conversations with
you and I told you about Jack

07:24.720 --> 07:26.679
and how he was always getting hurt

07:26.680 --> 07:28.279
that I thought that he
was out of his mind

07:28.280 --> 07:29.959
and that I would never date
anybody like that again,

07:29.960 --> 07:31.679
a little bell didn't go off
in your head and say,

07:31.680 --> 07:34.679
"Well, maybe I should tell her
now what I do for a living?"

07:34.680 --> 07:37.128
Exactly. And blow it?

07:37.880 --> 07:39.799
Well, when did you plan
on telling me this?

07:39.800 --> 07:41.799
- Well, today.
- Oh, today?

07:41.800 --> 07:43.399
Yeah, which is good you're here.

07:43.400 --> 07:44.999
Today was the day...
Mr. Spontaneity.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.719
You know what I pictured
you doing in Venice?

07:46.720 --> 07:48.959
I pictured you...

07:48.960 --> 07:51.879
I don't know, just busting
teenage pickpockets and stuff,

07:51.880 --> 07:55.439

street, drinking lemonade.

07:55.440 --> 07:58.799
I do fill in for a friend down
at the beach occasionally.

07:58.800 --> 08:02.159
And I often, often enjoy
a nice glass of lemonade.

08:02.160 --> 08:03.679
You know what?
I don't even know you.

08:03.680 --> 08:05.239
I feel I don't even know you.

08:05.240 --> 08:06.599
I don't even know who
you are anymore.

08:06.600 --> 08:08.729
I don't understand.

08:09.640 --> 08:14.439
We got to spend some time together,
then we'll get to know each other.

08:14.440 --> 08:16.079
Let's go away together.

Oh, The Caribbean.

08:24.880 --> 08:27.601
We've never even been
away for a weekend.

08:31.600 --> 08:35.169
I was going to surprise
you tonight, but, uh...

08:37.240 --> 08:39.210
It's a cruise.

08:41.039 --> 08:42.839
This is so unfair, Alex.

08:42.840 --> 08:47.319
You can't just pull out
tickets to some exotic island

08:47.320 --> 08:49.359
and think that's going
to make everything okay.

08:49.360 --> 08:51.959
I don't expect that
I can make it all right,

08:51.960 --> 08:54.239
but, uh, you know, maybe
I thought we could.

08:54.240 --> 08:55.599
No. Don't do that.

08:55.600 --> 08:57.079
I want to be depressed right now.

08:57.080 --> 08:58.759
I don't want you to, like, do that.

08:58.760 --> 08:59.799
Don't.

All right, all right.

How about a big smile
for the newlyweds?

09:50.440 --> 09:52.999
Oh, actually, we're not newlyweds.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.119
It's only 34.50 for a
double set of mugs

09:55.120 --> 09:56.359

09:56.360 --> 09:58.879
return them for photo
credit on a future cruise.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.359
My golf clubs...
Have you found them?

10:18.360 --> 10:21.039
Yes. There's absolutely
no reason to be upset.

10:21.040 --> 10:22.719
They're downstairs in storage,
and I'll bring them up

10:22.720 --> 10:25.359

- But not really.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.047
have a nice honeymoon.

- Thank you.
- Big enough for you?

You know that.

Yes!

I have Love Boat fever.

11:35.960 --> 11:37.479
It feels really good.

11:37.480 --> 11:41.039
I'm really, truly excited
about being on a cruise ship.

11:41.040 --> 11:42.879
I don't know why.

11:42.880 --> 11:44.119
Maybe they, like, pump drugs

11:44.120 --> 11:46.279
through, like, the air conditioning
system or something like that.

11:46.280 --> 11:48.319
What do you think?

11:48.320 --> 11:49.439
Yeah, you know what I need?

11:49.440 --> 11:52.319
I need lots of those
yummy little drinks

with those highly little
impractical umbrellas in them.

That is what I need.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.368
Yeah, you're looking good.

12:01.760 --> 12:05.323
So who's ready to party on
the big boat besides me?

12:08.960 --> 12:10.359
What's the matter?
You look a little tense.

12:10.360 --> 12:11.479
- Tense?
- Yes.

12:11.480 --> 12:12.559
- No.
- No?

12:12.560 --> 12:13.639

Yes. Yes, we talked.

Doesn't seem very
interested in golf

13:34.720 --> 13:36.599

about his clubs, though.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.479
No? Really? Why do you say that?

13:38.480 --> 13:40.039
Well...

13:40.040 --> 13:41.239

right behind him.

to go arrest him.

asked you to do before.

How can you be running the ship
if you're not on the bridge?

30:26.400 --> 30:28.723
Who is running the ship?

30:28.960 --> 30:31.319
Oh, yeah. I am.

30:31.320 --> 30:33.199
What is this? Who are you?

30:33.200 --> 30:37.399
I spent a great many years developing
computer systems for these cruise lines,

30:37.400 --> 30:38.719
including this baby.

30:38.720 --> 30:40.849
And then I got pushed away!

30:41.280 --> 30:42.799
What are you talking about?

30:42.800 --> 30:45.199
That's what really infuriates me.

30:45.200 --> 30:47.119

Oh, okay.

31:21.560 --> 31:22.959
- This is good.
- Okay.

31:22.960 --> 31:25.759
Captain, sweetheart,
would you mind taking a picture

31:25.760 --> 31:27.679
with my sister and me?

31:27.680 --> 31:29.719
No. Not at all.

Get in the middle.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.686
Right here. Okay.

another boat, sir.

this guy is capable of!

I'm the first officer on this

52:49.920 --> 52:51.279
Now, look, you've lost
control of autopilot,

52:51.280 --> 52:53.799

Yes, that's exactly right, sir.

Harv, give me your pants!

57:59.680 --> 58:02.039
My pants? No one else is
taking off their pants.

58:02.040 --> 58:03.279
I took off mine.

58:03.280 --> 58:06.319
I wanna know why she hasn't
taken anything off yet!

58:06.320 --> 58:09.610
'Cause I'm not wearing
any underwear, Harvey.

58:10.520 --> 58:11.599
Oh.

58:21.600 --> 58:23.445

58:28.760 --> 58:31.481
Yeah, this'll do.

58:36.440 --> 58:38.330
This will do.

58:39.320 --> 58:42.279
Did you try to close the fuel
tanks manually, cut the power?

58:42.280 --> 58:46.127
Yeah, but he's sealed off all
access to engine room 4.

58:49.480 --> 58:51.039
Which of these controls
the autopilot?

58:51.040 --> 58:52.559
MERCED: I don't know.

58:52.560 --> 58:55.039
Look, I'm the navigator. I'm not
familiar with this equipment.

58:55.040 --> 58:56.519
Oh, you're not familiar?

58:56.520 --> 58:58.206
I see.

58:59.040 --> 59:00.759
Are you...

59:00.760 --> 59:02.605
Familiar with this?

59:07.920 --> 59:09.959
Sir, this is Merced
in engine control!

59:09.960 --> 59:12.759
He's smashing up all the equipment!
Do you copy?

59:12.760 --> 59:15.599
Which of these is not
hooked up to the computer?

59:15.600 --> 59:17.119
Look, there's plenty not
hooked up to the computer

59:17.120 --> 59:19.839
but nothing that
overrides his program.

59:19.840 --> 59:22.119
Then we have to fool his program.

59:22.120 --> 59:24.479
We cannot stop the ship.

59:24.480 --> 59:26.279
I wanna slow it down.

59:26.280 --> 59:27.759
What you gonna do?

59:27.760 --> 59:30.279
You gonna let the air
out of our tires?

59:30.280 --> 59:31.479
What are these buttons?
What are these switches?

59:31.480 --> 59:32.599
Don't you touch them!

59:32.600 --> 59:34.079
They open the ballast doors!

59:34.080 --> 59:36.005
You wanna flood the ship?

59:38.160 --> 59:41.159
Sir, this is Merced!
Does anybody copy?

59:41.160 --> 59:43.039
Hello? Somebody answer me!

59:43.040 --> 59:45.479
We're gonna flood the
ship just like you said.

59:45.480 --> 59:47.399
What are you talking about?

59:47.400 --> 59:48.999
Might slow her down.

59:49.000 --> 59:50.919
Right, now, you shut up!
You shut your mouth!

59:50.920 --> 59:52.399
I never said that!

59:52.400 --> 59:55.531
If we take on too much
water, we'll all go down.

59:56.440 --> 59:59.446
Sir! Somebody answer me! Lis...

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:04.611
Flood it.

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:15.599
It's not working!

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:17.081
Will you hurry up?

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:20.519
Wait. Dante, I think
I've got something.

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:21.679
Whoa!

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:23.319
Everybody, back off!

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:24.959
Hurry up! Hurry up!

Can you guys get out?

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:02.999
If you'll back off with the saw.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.079
What?

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:08.599
If you'll back off with the
saw, we'll give it a try!

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:09.759
Oh, sorry!

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:12.003
Sorry. Sorry.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:19.519

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:22.439
Look, I've never let a million
gallons of water into a ship before.

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:24.285
Give me a second.

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:28.163
I've got 3 watertight
doors to close,

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:31.684
and I've got to shut off
these sensors as well.

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:34.759
Where's this?

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:36.959
That's the ballast room.

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:38.759
That's right underneath us.

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.446
That's what we're flooding.

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:46.519
All right, watertight
doors are closed.

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:48.729
Ballast doors should
open any minute.

You just told me to open them!

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:07.365
Follow me.

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:25.844
I can't close it just like that.

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:29.720

be 15 next month.

Are we gonna die here?

everybody just to stay calm.

You don't even work on this ship!

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:52.039
I've been in worse
situations than this,

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:53.559
and panicking does
not help. Trust me.

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:57.279
We have our life vests.
We can jump off the ship.

01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:59.719
You'd get sucked into the propellers.
I wouldn't recommend it.

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:02.805
Oh, God, that would suck.

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:21.839
Why did the ship start up again?

Why... Why... Why did
you leave me upstairs?

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.839
We have a situation.

01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:31.119
I know we have a situation.
What? What?

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:32.959
Geiger's taken over the ship.

Geiger. I'm-not-looking-
at-my-golf-game Geiger?

all the software..."

blow up everything."

to save this ship.

it's just a computer.

the spoon to the grenade.

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:32.199
- Spoon? What?
- With a string.

01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:33.479
Oh, baby, don't say grenade.

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:34.881
Okay. A string.

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:37.679
Your shoelace!

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:39.319
Come on.

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:40.759
I got it.

01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:41.879
That's it.

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:43.039
Okay, all right.

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:44.079
Okay.

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:46.881
Okay, be real careful.

01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:52.839
ANNIE:
All right. Here it goes. Uh...

01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.359
You gotta hurry up.

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:55.807
Okay, Okay.

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:00.519
Got it. Got it.

01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:02.079
Got it. What now?

01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:05.643
Pull the pin out and
remove the grenade.

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.291
Uh... Uh...

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:15.999
You pull out the pin, and
I will pull out the grenade.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.164
- Okay.
- On the count of three. One...

01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:20.199
Two...

01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:21.726
Three.

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:25.481
(GRUNTING)

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:30.759
Where is it? Where is it?

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:31.879
Where is it?

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:33.359
It's in your hand.

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:35.639
Where? Take it out. Take it out!

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:38.159
Take it out. Take it out.
Got it? Take it.

01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:39.479
- I got it.
- Okay, got it?

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:42.042
- Yeah.
- Alex!

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:46.319
You can open the door now.

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:48.768
Okay.

01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:56.361
(BEEPING)

01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:04.565
No.

01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:27.639
Here's some more dry towels.

01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:29.565
Thank you.

01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:32.199
I am so sorry I yelled at you.

01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:33.919
That's Okay, Dad.

01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:36.163
I'm okay.

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:41.130
Okay.

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:44.159
Where's Alex?

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:46.085
"Where's Alex?"

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:48.486
(COUGHING)

01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:54.410
Come over here.

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:58.279
- Just sit down. Don't talk. Don't move.
- I'm okay.

01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:00.679
You're not okay. Stop saying that.

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:02.366
All right?

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.610
Are you okay?

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:10.359
I don't think so.

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:12.285
What?

01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:14.079
He's adjusting starboard.

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:15.439
ANNIE: What does that mean?

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:18.039
Does that mean right, left, around the
island, what? What does that mean?

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:19.919
No. Right into the island.

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:21.399
ANNIE: We're moving again.

01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:22.879
JULIANO: He's turning us
1/2 a degree starboard.

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:24.559
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, guys.

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:26.246
We're getting closer.

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:29.799
Okay. I'm cutting the
serial port connection.

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:32.123
- Anything?
- Uh...

01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:36.010
No, we're still locked out.

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:38.084
Come on.

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:40.559
MERCED: Hey, we're moving.

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:42.079
We have control again.

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:44.399
No, we're still dead here.

01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:46.239
Are you sure, sir,
because we're turning.

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:47.279
It's him.

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:48.959
It's him, it's him, it's him.

01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:50.399
He's on board.
Geiger's still on board.

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:52.802
Hey, guys. Guys, maybe
these people can help.

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:55.719
JULIANO: Hand me those.

01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:58.088
Right there.

01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:04.968
He's taking us right
into an oil tanker.

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:06.879
What?

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:08.199
You're right.

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:13.399
She's anchored 16 miles out,
and we are doing 17.8 knots.

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:14.919
Well, how long till they move?

01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:17.439
From starting their
engines, 30 minutes.

01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:19.839
There's no chance they're gonna
get out of our way in time.

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:23.164
So, what... What...
What does that mean?

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:26.970
Oh, man!

01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:29.808
Uh, he's turning us another 1/4.

01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:39.011
Ah! Damn it. (GROANS)

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:42.159
Can we turn the ship
without the rudder?

01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:44.239
MERCED:
The bow thrusters would do it.

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:46.719
JULIANO: We can't get there now.
You guys flooded the access.

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:49.199
Yeah, well, we also messed
up his program, sir.

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:51.559
No, you almost sunk us.

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:53.439
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:55.799
Let's take a wrench and
dump it into the engine

01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:58.959
and bust the transmission like
a car 'cause I've done that.

01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:01.319
With all due respect,
this is not your car.

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:04.199
- This is a cruise liner.
- ALEX: She's right. It's a propeller.

01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:05.639
We got to stop the propeller.

01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:08.159
You could wedge something
into it underneath the ship,

01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:10.479
(STAMMERING) like a steel cable.

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:13.159
This is not my
suggestion, obviously.

01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:15.039
Great idea. I'll go under the ship.

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:16.159
No, you won't.

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:18.399
No, you won't. That's
not what I meant.

01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:19.479
That's a stupid idea.

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:21.679
- No, it's a great idea.
- No.

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:23.439
It's suicide. These blades
are 12 feet across.

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:25.490
They'll suck you in and kill you.

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:45.239
Hey. Hey, Dino, I got one for you.

01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:49.159
Okay, who played the German
captain in <i>The Enemy Below?</i>

01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:51.164
Curt Jurgens.

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:01.359
Down the next stairwell
on the left,

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.959
straight to the bowels of the ship.

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:05.488
Bowels. That doesn't
sound very good.

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:08.559
How much time left?

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:10.803
Not very much. We better hurry.

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:12.679
Mayday, Mayday.

01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:16.239
This is <i>Seabourn Legend</i> bearing
80 degrees east-northeast.

01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:18.959
Engine and steering
control nonfunctional.

01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:20.805
I repeat. Nonfunctional.

01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:21.999

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:25.279

01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:26.759
This is <i>Seabourn Legend.</i>

01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:28.959
<i>Eindhoven Lion</i>, come in.

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:30.759

is <i>Seabourn Legend.</i>

01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:33.481
Come in, <i>Eindhoven Lion.</i>

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:38.769
This is the only way out.

01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:42.482
- This all the diving gear?
- Yeah.

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:44.724
Okay, here it goes.

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:07.608
- (BEEPING)
- Huh?

01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:18.523
- You think that ship's gonna rescue us?
- What else could it be?

01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:20.559
Alex, maybe this isn't
such a hot idea.

01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:23.239
Maybe you should just leave
the propeller alone, huh?

01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:25.130
We have to stop the ship.

01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:27.891
There's not much time left.

01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:31.879
Are you sure this is gonna hold?

01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:33.279
Yeah. We use those lines
all over the ship.

01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:36.119
He's not going all over the ship.

01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:40.002
- He's going under the ship, all right?
- Annie, Annie. It's okay. It'll hold.

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:51.319
Hold on. Let me lock it.

01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:53.051

Here's the guideline.

01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:29.567
Feed it into the propeller, and
it will pull the heavy cable in.

01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:39.481
- Not too much slack.
- Okay, okay, okay. I've got him.

01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:57.450

get him up then, huh?

- Come on.
- Pull him back up.

you're not gonna stop her.

01:55:55.920 --> 01:55:58.971
I didn't think I was gonna
make it there for a second.

01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:04.971
Thank you.

01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:12.399
Look what I found in
international waters.

01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:13.801
Whoo!

01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:16.802
This really is paradise.

01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:18.886
I got something for you.

01:56:27.800 --> 01:56:29.079
Wow.

01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:31.244
You want to wear this for a while?

01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:37.090
How long were you thinking?

01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:39.919
50 years.

01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:41.446
Yeah?

01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:43.726
Yeah.

01:56:53.480 --> 01:56:56.079
Can I make all the travel
plans from now on?

01:56:56.080 --> 01:56:57.891
Deal.

01:57:45.640 --> 01:57:47.079
Hello.

01:57:47.080 --> 01:57:48.239
Mr. Kenter.

01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:49.721
Oh, Annie.

01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:52.719
- Oh, you're back again.
- Yeah.

01:57:52.720 --> 01:57:53.999
Hope you don't mind.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:55.519
I kind of requested you.

01:57:55.520 --> 01:57:58.959
I wanted to make up for last week.

01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:00.199
Why would I mind?

01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:03.439
Gosh, uh, I'm sure it'll
go much better today.

01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:04.719
Oh, yeah, it will.

01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:05.799
Had some problems...

01:58:05.800 --> 01:58:07.239
A little nervous,
yeah, a little bit.

01:58:07.240 --> 01:58:09.722
Okay, Mr. Kenter, here we go.

01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:25.839
Sorry, Mr. Kenter, but that
bus was going way too fast.

01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:28.799
I noticed that.
Uh, make a left here.

01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:30.159
Got it. Excuse me.

01:58:30.160 --> 01:58:33.450
