19:44.875 --> 19:47.291

19:47.333 --> 19:49.375
- Yeeeeaaaahhh...?

19:47.333 --> 19:49.375

19:49.417 --> 19:51.125

19:59.834 --> 20:01.041
- I know.

20:02.208 --> 20:04.166
Read the note on his leg.

20:08.917 --> 20:10.667
- It says...

20:10.709 --> 20:12.166
"Do you wanna be my girl?"

20:15.667 --> 20:17.083
No thank you, I have to go now.

20:19.709 --> 20:21.709
- Oh well. Be free.

20:25.125 --> 20:27.250
Lazy.

20:29.333 --> 20:31.625
- Late.

20:29.333 --> 20:31.625

20:34.125 --> 20:35.959

20:36.000 --> 20:38.291

20:39.625 --> 20:41.291
Y'know what'll

20:39.625 --> 20:41.291

20:41.333 --> 20:44.125

20:46.333 --> 20:48.750

20:48.792 --> 20:52.291
until Mitch confesses and my

20:48.792 --> 20:52.291

20:52.333 --> 20:54.458
- Please?

20:52.333 --> 20:54.458

20:54.500 --> 20:56.041

21:18.959 --> 21:20.125

21:22.208 --> 21:24.208
Admit that you FRAMED

21:22.208 --> 21:24.208
Jasper Dunlop.

21:24.250 --> 21:25.709
- Y-you can't force me to--

21:29.875 --> 21:31.875
- Admit it, so I don't have to

21:29.875 --> 21:31.875
punch you in the face

21:31.917 --> 21:33.834
and smash your groin.

21:33.875 --> 21:35.083
- Y-you wouldn't hurt a kid!

21:35.125 --> 21:38.542
- Oh please, you look

21:35.125 --> 21:38.542

21:39.667 --> 21:41.208
- Fair point.

21:41.250 --> 21:43.417
- Now admit you're the one

21:41.250 --> 21:43.417

21:43.458 --> 21:44.166

21:44.208 --> 21:46.166
- O-okay, I did it!

21:46.208 --> 21:47.417
I framed Jasper!

21:47.458 --> 21:50.208
I'm a thief and a bad person!

21:50.250 --> 21:51.458
- And Jasper's a really

21:50.250 --> 21:51.458

21:54.458 --> 21:56.291

21:56.333 --> 21:58.375
-Yep. Got it!

22:02.834 --> 22:04.083
