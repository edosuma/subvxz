02:15.134 --> 02:17.836
Hey, handsome.

03:40.923 --> 03:42.925
Brain activity normal.

03:56.255 --> 03:57.256
Stop!

03:57.623 --> 03:59.124
You have not been verified.

04:34.999 --> 04:37.445
Verification complete.

04:37.756 --> 04:39.857
Welcome, ezra.

04:53.505 --> 04:56.740
Please state your date of birth.

04:56.815 --> 04:57.815
What?

04:57.885 --> 05:00.493
Can you recall your birthday, ezra?

05:01.086 --> 05:03.790
October second.

05:04.029 --> 05:05.236
Correct.

05:05.330 --> 05:07.320
Please identify the following:

05:08.814 --> 05:10.882
A firetruck.

05:11.030 --> 05:12.096
An apple.

05:12.141 --> 05:13.654
Well done.

05:13.742 --> 05:15.831
Can you read this word?

05:17.036 --> 05:18.803
Encyclopedia.

05:18.879 --> 05:20.772
Why are you asking me these questions?

05:20.907 --> 05:23.408
To ensure that you are
Functioning properly.

05:23.449 --> 05:25.801
Can you identify this person?

05:30.716 --> 05:32.050
Lynn.

05:32.166 --> 05:33.318
My wife.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.338
And this person?

05:36.555 --> 05:38.185
Where did you get these pictures?

05:38.304 --> 05:39.871
This is your daughter.

05:40.031 --> 05:42.161
Can you not recall her name?

05:43.128 --> 05:44.691
Kylie.

05:44.790 --> 05:45.898
Her name's kylie.

05:45.958 --> 05:48.412
You have passed your evaluation.

05:48.801 --> 05:50.674
Please let me know if you experience.

05:50.749 --> 05:53.484
Dizziness, nausea, or
Shortness of breath.

06:00.079 --> 06:01.595
Help!

06:03.255 --> 06:04.459
Help!

06:04.799 --> 06:08.802
Help!

06:09.922 --> 06:11.446
Hey! Hey!

06:11.530 --> 06:13.933
It's okay, I got you.

06:19.558 --> 06:21.059
There we go.

06:21.120 --> 06:22.818
I'm okay.

06:24.704 --> 06:27.005
Okay. Okay.

06:28.540 --> 06:30.385
Thank you. Thank you.

06:30.945 --> 06:32.210
<I>Help!</I>

06:32.274 --> 06:33.943
Get back!

06:47.606 --> 06:49.507
Whoa! It's all right.

06:49.554 --> 06:50.554
I'm here to help.

06:50.629 --> 06:51.865
Are you hurt?

06:52.664 --> 06:53.898
You're treading water.

06:53.942 --> 06:55.402
You know how to swim.

06:55.688 --> 06:57.483
We'll go to the shore, okay?

07:47.886 --> 07:49.863
Can you state your date of birth?

07:49.959 --> 07:51.064
Back off!

07:51.136 --> 07:52.270
Very well.

07:52.373 --> 07:54.259
I will prepare your equipment.

07:56.088 --> 07:57.368
Was there anyone else out there?

07:57.396 --> 07:58.641
I don't know.

07:58.751 --> 08:00.576
I didn't see anyone.

08:01.667 --> 08:02.900
What happened?

08:02.963 --> 08:04.593
Did we crash?

08:04.750 --> 08:06.392
I don't remember.

08:06.952 --> 08:09.354
Why are we dressed like this?

08:12.678 --> 08:13.852
Hey!

08:13.892 --> 08:15.327
Leave him alone!

08:16.281 --> 08:18.267
Verification complete.

08:18.364 --> 08:19.732
Welcome, abram.

08:20.586 --> 08:22.399
Are you okay?

08:22.754 --> 08:24.219
I...

08:24.356 --> 08:26.209
I woke up on the lake.

08:27.025 --> 08:28.857
We all did.

08:28.961 --> 08:30.666
It's going to be all right.

08:30.855 --> 08:32.799
Your name's abram?

08:32.984 --> 08:34.765
- Yeah.
- I'm ezra.

08:34.804 --> 08:35.951
This is...

08:36.368 --> 08:37.477
Feena.

08:39.538 --> 08:40.864
We're going to help each other.

08:40.905 --> 08:42.755
- Okay?
- Where are we?

08:42.941 --> 08:44.945
None of this looks familiar.

08:46.044 --> 08:47.909
It's worse than you think.

08:56.019 --> 08:58.032
That's a karik warship.

08:58.708 --> 09:00.463
Like the ones from the invasion.

09:04.563 --> 09:06.330
It looks a thousand years old.

09:06.405 --> 09:08.429
That is not karik.

09:10.172 --> 09:12.757
It's not human either.

09:12.881 --> 09:14.043
Neither is that tower.

09:34.046 --> 09:35.923
What did you find?

09:47.773 --> 09:49.729
What is that?

09:54.940 --> 09:56.299
Is that a car?

09:58.329 --> 09:59.898
It was a car.

10:03.055 --> 10:05.384
How long does it take for
A tire to decompose?

10:05.624 --> 10:07.124
Who knows the answer to that?

10:07.239 --> 10:08.507
A hundred years, maybe?

10:09.908 --> 10:12.377
Engine block would take
A lot longer than that.

10:13.632 --> 10:15.112
So what are you saying?

10:20.986 --> 10:24.022
I'm saying this car's
Been here for centuries.

10:24.830 --> 10:26.163
That's impossible.

10:26.279 --> 10:27.945
Cars haven't been around that long.

10:28.017 --> 10:29.626
This one has.

10:30.148 --> 10:31.456
Those too.

10:31.924 --> 10:33.677
This was a road?

10:33.906 --> 10:35.840
Where's the asphalt?

10:35.921 --> 10:37.321
Disintegrated?

10:37.386 --> 10:38.841
Covered in sand?

10:38.937 --> 10:41.204
That would take... Centuries.

10:41.285 --> 10:43.667
Maybe acid rain corroded
Everything really quickly.

10:44.763 --> 10:46.196
Rain in a desert?

10:46.264 --> 10:48.224
It makes more sense than
What you're suggesting.

10:48.266 --> 10:50.939
You just said that looks like
It's been here a thousand years.

10:51.003 --> 10:52.247
Well, it was an expression.

10:52.280 --> 10:54.896
I don't have a master's
Degree in metal corrosion.

10:55.273 --> 10:57.519
The invasion started three years ago.

10:58.176 --> 11:00.694
That thing has been here
A lot longer than that.

11:00.846 --> 11:02.141
Wait!

11:03.455 --> 11:05.232
Three years?

11:05.417 --> 11:07.254
The invasion started a year ago.

11:09.748 --> 11:11.049
Last october.

11:11.123 --> 11:12.573
L.A., new york, tokyo.

11:12.615 --> 11:14.639
The invasion started three years ago.

11:14.766 --> 11:16.867
Three years, five months.

11:16.928 --> 11:18.229
Three years, two months.

11:18.338 --> 11:19.390
It's december.

11:19.431 --> 11:20.842
It's march.

11:21.466 --> 11:22.879
It gets weirder.

11:23.135 --> 11:24.865
I'm 67 years old.

11:26.758 --> 11:28.059
You sure?

11:28.240 --> 11:29.974
I think I know how old I am.

11:30.227 --> 11:31.587
Well, you don't look a day over...

11:31.611 --> 11:33.135
Twentyfive?

11:33.545 --> 11:36.681
That's because this is what I
Looked like in my twenties.

11:37.069 --> 11:38.449
You have been reconstituted.

11:38.450 --> 11:40.291
At the prime of your lives.

11:40.879 --> 11:43.044
Reconstituted?

11:43.729 --> 11:46.165
This way, please.

11:50.929 --> 11:53.198
Your equipment.

11:55.053 --> 11:57.054
Your immune systems have been modified.

11:57.094 --> 11:59.863
To accomodate new diseases and bacteria,

12:00.038 --> 12:02.371
But I santized the
Water in your canteens.

12:02.465 --> 12:03.804
Just to be safe.

12:03.875 --> 12:04.885
What do you mean,

12:04.910 --> 12:06.697
Our immune systems have been modified?

12:06.738 --> 12:08.739
Your original genes have been altered.

12:08.780 --> 12:11.000
To increase your chance of surviving.

12:11.569 --> 12:12.569
What?

12:12.617 --> 12:14.219
Our genes?

12:15.954 --> 12:17.114
Who are you?

12:17.255 --> 12:19.011
Where are we? What is this?

12:19.118 --> 12:21.786
I am programmed to answer
Some of your questions.

12:22.127 --> 12:24.039
Then answer them!

12:24.296 --> 12:26.636
Why do we remember things differently?

12:26.758 --> 12:29.237
He said the invasion
Started only a year ago.

12:29.262 --> 12:30.295
Why?

12:30.320 --> 12:33.294
Becasue he died one year
After the invasion began.

12:33.472 --> 12:35.949
He would naturally have no
Memories beyond that point.

12:36.057 --> 12:37.330
Wait...

12:38.047 --> 12:39.077
I'm dead?

12:39.114 --> 12:40.318
You were.

12:40.359 --> 12:42.293
Now you're alive again.

12:42.347 --> 12:43.850
And you, ezra,

12:43.958 --> 12:46.407
Died three years after the invasion.

12:46.531 --> 12:47.862
Thus, in your mind,

12:47.916 --> 12:50.254
The invasion began three years ago.

12:50.311 --> 12:51.746
And I died last.

12:51.799 --> 12:52.939
Yes.

12:53.005 --> 12:55.804
Are you saying this is
Some kind of purgatory?

12:55.894 --> 12:57.942
This is not the afterlife, abram.

12:58.028 --> 13:01.560
This is earth long after
Human extinction.

13:01.867 --> 13:03.984
Extinction?

13:04.081 --> 13:08.315
The karik annihilated your
Species over 400 years ago.

13:09.808 --> 13:12.130
So... Everyone we know...

13:12.210 --> 13:13.990
Is dead.

13:14.780 --> 13:16.369
All my grandchildren...

13:16.472 --> 13:18.884
I am sorry for your loss.

13:41.959 --> 13:43.716
How did you bring us back?

13:43.809 --> 13:45.654
We call them sparks.

13:46.093 --> 13:48.203
They are biological weavers.

13:48.660 --> 13:49.708
Weavers?

13:49.733 --> 13:52.232
You are an intricately
Constructed organism.

13:52.350 --> 13:54.711
Ten thousand trillion cells,

13:54.760 --> 13:57.779
Each with as many as
100 million proteins.

13:57.835 --> 14:00.103
The sparks rebuilt them all.

14:00.258 --> 14:01.994
Are you saying they made us?

14:02.093 --> 14:03.500
Remade.

14:04.129 --> 14:05.224
Using what?

14:05.277 --> 14:07.111
The fundamental elements of life.

14:07.365 --> 14:08.478
Are all around you.

14:08.533 --> 14:10.201
They need merely to be organized.

14:10.313 --> 14:11.635
So they're what?

14:11.904 --> 14:13.068
God?

14:13.638 --> 14:15.606
Is the plow the farmer?

14:15.707 --> 14:17.494
A tool is a tool.

14:18.210 --> 14:19.370
Could they bring anyone back?

14:19.394 --> 14:21.021
You mean lynn and kylie.

14:21.046 --> 14:22.072
Can they?

14:22.097 --> 14:25.799
We are programmed to bring
Back the three of you.

14:26.071 --> 14:27.172
Why us?

14:27.219 --> 14:28.739
More questions will be answered.

14:28.763 --> 14:30.563
Once we reach the settlement.

14:30.622 --> 14:32.076
Settlement?

14:32.390 --> 14:34.124
You said humans were extinct.

14:34.198 --> 14:35.493
You were.

14:35.560 --> 14:39.129
The settlement is composed
Of humans we have reborn.

14:39.245 --> 14:41.267
So you've done this before.

14:42.567 --> 14:43.968
You've brought back other people.

14:44.044 --> 14:45.237
Yes.

14:45.303 --> 14:48.439
We will help you restore the human race.

14:57.749 --> 14:59.347
So where is this settlement?

14:59.417 --> 15:00.894
I will guide you.

15:00.987 --> 15:03.164
The sparks will come with us,

15:03.255 --> 15:06.124
Carried in this canister.

15:08.493 --> 15:09.693
How do I catch them?

15:09.794 --> 15:11.218
They will come to you.

15:26.911 --> 15:28.557
This will get hot in the sun.

15:28.653 --> 15:30.721
Sparks are resilient.

15:30.822 --> 15:32.156
Anything else?

15:32.209 --> 15:33.855
Food.

15:34.653 --> 15:37.483
Sparks wove these plants for you.

15:37.789 --> 15:38.956
To eat?

15:38.998 --> 15:41.425
They contain every nutrient, vitamin,

15:41.468 --> 15:45.162
Mineral and protein you
Need to sustain life.

15:45.416 --> 15:47.552
Carry what you can in your pouches.

15:51.970 --> 15:53.314
Can we trust this thing?

15:53.405 --> 15:55.518
I say we hit it with a rock and run.

15:56.288 --> 15:57.801
Run where?

15:57.909 --> 15:59.637
We don't know where we are.

15:59.844 --> 16:01.345
And if it's telling the truth,

16:01.410 --> 16:03.847
The only people that can help
Us are at that settlement.

16:03.946 --> 16:05.941
And if it's not telling the truth?

16:06.017 --> 16:07.418
It shot us with a dart.

16:07.468 --> 16:09.353
It could shoot us with something else.

16:09.434 --> 16:11.896
Do you really want to take that risk?

16:14.592 --> 16:17.447
Feena, I must prick your finger now.

16:17.889 --> 16:19.020
Why?

16:19.130 --> 16:21.241
To ensure that you are woven correctly.

16:21.344 --> 16:23.467
I am not allowed to bring
Dangerous mutations.

16:23.521 --> 16:25.021
Into the settlement.

16:25.136 --> 16:26.415
If she says no?

16:26.485 --> 16:28.319
I will use the dart.

16:28.440 --> 16:30.412
The dart hurts, fyi.

16:42.053 --> 16:43.709
Verification complete.

16:43.875 --> 16:45.069
Welcome, feena.

16:48.534 --> 16:49.626
If I knew we had a choice,

16:49.654 --> 16:51.800
I would've went with the finger prick.

17:02.999 --> 17:04.089
How do we know this drone's.

17:04.113 --> 17:05.380
Not taking us to the karik?

17:05.609 --> 17:07.349
Karik never use drones.

17:07.512 --> 17:08.837
That we know of.

17:08.913 --> 17:12.185
It's been 400 years. Tech changes.

17:12.259 --> 17:13.326
The karik wiped us out.

17:13.377 --> 17:14.644
Why would they bring us back?

17:14.673 --> 17:16.795
Why did they attack us
In the first place?

17:16.921 --> 17:18.183
They're karik.

17:18.249 --> 17:20.027
Maybe they don't need a reason.

17:20.925 --> 17:22.788
They said we died at different times.

17:22.987 --> 17:24.253
So?

17:24.462 --> 17:27.141
So do you remember how you died?

17:28.700 --> 17:30.261
No, actually.

17:30.368 --> 17:32.408
I don't even remember the
Moment right before.

17:32.470 --> 17:34.591
Like, getting shot at or whatever.

17:34.859 --> 17:36.026
Me neither.

17:36.153 --> 17:37.741
What does that mean?

17:37.835 --> 17:39.202
I don't know.

17:39.244 --> 17:40.911
I remember the invasion.

17:40.992 --> 17:42.613
That's crystal clear.

17:42.753 --> 17:45.546
I was in louisiana for
My grandson's birthday.

17:46.144 --> 17:48.145
Had I been at home in chicago,

17:48.349 --> 17:50.309
I would've died with everybody else.

17:51.222 --> 17:52.733
Lucky, I guess.

17:53.625 --> 17:55.101
How about you, ezra?

17:55.259 --> 17:57.071
Where were you?

17:58.329 --> 17:59.558
Washington.

18:01.719 --> 18:03.445
What does the map say?

18:04.569 --> 18:05.782
I can't get a signal.

18:05.807 --> 18:06.814
I tried multiple lines...

18:06.839 --> 18:07.919
Nothing, no reading at all.

18:07.943 --> 18:09.855
It won't even tell us where we are.

18:09.981 --> 18:11.141
We can't take the interstate.

18:11.245 --> 18:12.265
Everyone will do that.

18:12.290 --> 18:14.290
Everyone will think that
And take backroads.

18:14.314 --> 18:15.105
What about the 117?

18:15.231 --> 18:16.951
Doesn't that turn into
Bellamy church road?

18:16.980 --> 18:18.472
I don't know, I've never been down here.

18:18.496 --> 18:19.875
I say we turn back and
Take that highway.

18:19.899 --> 18:20.987
I'm not taking some highway.

18:21.011 --> 18:22.211
If I don't know where it goes.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.052
You're going too fast. Slow down.

18:24.146 --> 18:25.714
Will you calm down, please?

18:25.963 --> 18:27.296
I'm getting a map.

18:27.350 --> 18:29.119
Should we say a prayer?

18:31.207 --> 18:34.194
Yes, yes, kylie lou, a
Prayer is just what we need!

18:34.418 --> 18:35.418
You do that.

18:35.505 --> 18:37.089
I'll get the map.

18:44.148 --> 18:45.277
You want to consider.

18:45.349 --> 18:47.126
What you're teaching our
Daughter right now?

18:47.317 --> 18:49.819
What I'm teaching her is that
We have to do our part too.

18:49.954 --> 18:52.156
Our part too or our part only?

18:52.263 --> 18:55.254
If god let this happen,
Lynn, do you really think.

18:55.279 --> 18:57.525
He's going to single us out for favor?

18:57.714 --> 18:59.638
Don't you?

19:27.885 --> 19:28.917
Amen.

19:28.993 --> 19:30.470
Amen.

19:30.561 --> 19:31.737
Amen.

19:35.933 --> 19:37.310
<I>...All lanes leaving the city.</I>

19:37.334 --> 19:38.911
Again, if you're just now joining us,

19:38.936 --> 19:41.524
This footage you're now seeing
Is a vessel of unknown origin.

19:41.548 --> 19:44.486
That has maintained its flight
Position over downtown l.A.

19:44.528 --> 19:46.762
Since 10:00 a.M. This morning.

19:46.877 --> 19:48.889
Hey.

19:49.545 --> 19:51.738
Cash only. Card reader just broke.

19:53.283 --> 19:55.074
I don't have any cash.

20:10.451 --> 20:12.675
You okay back there, sweet potato?

20:13.003 --> 20:14.838
This is fun?

20:19.709 --> 20:22.304
I'm not going to let anything
Happen to this family.

20:22.879 --> 20:24.210
Neither are you.

20:37.787 --> 20:39.188
Washington.

20:39.296 --> 20:41.484
You were lucky too, I guess.

20:42.158 --> 20:43.941
What about you?

20:44.141 --> 20:45.148
No thanks.

20:45.195 --> 20:46.715
Come on. We're all sharing.

20:46.829 --> 20:48.269
Well, then you can exclude me.

20:48.293 --> 20:50.139
From your little therapy session.

20:50.200 --> 20:52.446
My life is none of your business.

20:55.036 --> 20:56.356
You'd think after 67 years

20:56.380 --> 20:58.082
I'd understand women.

20:58.815 --> 21:00.272
Nope.

21:00.924 --> 21:02.072
Give me a second.

21:17.968 --> 21:19.602
You're a private person.

21:19.836 --> 21:21.392
My mistake.

21:21.599 --> 21:22.966
I think it's my age.

21:23.249 --> 21:24.770
You reach 60 and you think you can say.

21:24.794 --> 21:25.810
And ask whatever you want.

21:25.834 --> 21:28.393
Because who's going to
Punch an old man, right?

21:28.745 --> 21:29.778
Your life is your life.

21:29.846 --> 21:31.303
It's none of my business.

21:32.605 --> 21:34.707
And yes, we are two of
The only people alive,

21:34.818 --> 21:36.419
Which greatly diminishes the opportunity.

21:36.443 --> 21:37.452
For good conversation,

21:37.477 --> 21:39.203
But hey, I'm not going to pry.

21:40.724 --> 21:42.724
Of course, if you're a
Serial killer or something,

21:42.748 --> 21:44.475
I'd appreciate a headsup.

21:47.524 --> 21:48.691
Ezra!

21:48.799 --> 21:49.899
Come look at this.

21:49.959 --> 21:52.345
There's something you
Don't see every day.

21:53.203 --> 21:54.978
You know what I think?

21:55.539 --> 21:57.363
I think I like being young again.

21:58.809 --> 22:02.565
No osteoporosis, no back
Ache, 20/20 vision.

22:02.720 --> 22:04.887
I peed back there...
It didn't even hurt.

22:04.981 --> 22:06.128
Too much information.

22:06.162 --> 22:07.196
My point is,

22:07.221 --> 22:09.331
I haven't felt this alive in 50 years!

22:11.088 --> 22:12.892
Who wants to race me to the rings?

22:14.658 --> 22:16.274
It's over 100 degrees.

22:16.426 --> 22:18.682
Yeah, but we're alive!

22:20.430 --> 22:21.831
Come on!

22:21.903 --> 22:24.242
Afraid you're going to
Lose to an old man?

22:26.836 --> 22:28.565
No takers?

22:31.261 --> 22:32.891
Suit yourselves.

22:32.969 --> 22:35.772
Last one there is a rotten egg.

22:39.182 --> 22:40.587
Rotten egg.

22:40.717 --> 22:42.120
You ever heard of that?

22:42.639 --> 22:44.435
Must be an old person thing.

23:37.841 --> 23:39.526
Abram!

23:39.643 --> 23:41.736
Abram, are you okay?

23:48.659 --> 23:50.003
Abram!

23:52.956 --> 23:53.975
What happened?

23:54.000 --> 23:55.309
I'm all right.

23:57.915 --> 24:04.234
I touched one of the
Symbols, and I saw...

24:05.422 --> 24:06.922
What?

24:07.644 --> 24:09.253
Everything.

24:18.448 --> 24:19.974
Move!

24:23.853 --> 24:25.111
Abram!

24:34.524 --> 24:36.320
What is that?

24:40.763 --> 24:42.240
His breathing's shallow.

24:42.294 --> 24:43.313
His heart's racing.

24:43.341 --> 24:44.759
What do we do?

25:04.294 --> 25:06.224
- Can you move?
- Yeah.

25:06.280 --> 25:07.504
Okay, let's go.

25:37.027 --> 25:39.333
What did you inject in my friend?

25:39.990 --> 25:42.022
What was in this needle?

25:44.410 --> 25:45.644
Are you from the settlement?

25:45.669 --> 25:47.477
Your drone lies to you.

25:48.979 --> 25:50.440
There is no settlement.

25:51.608 --> 25:55.174
There is you and there is us.

25:56.966 --> 25:58.934
Us who?

25:59.182 --> 26:00.542
If you're not from the settlement,

26:00.566 --> 26:01.884
Who are you?

26:02.217 --> 26:03.737
What is that on the back of your neck?

26:03.761 --> 26:06.025
I am not on the back of the neck.

26:06.663 --> 26:09.121
The skin rider and the body are one.

26:11.428 --> 26:12.733
Is that what you are?

26:12.796 --> 26:13.860
A skin rider?

26:13.897 --> 26:15.560
Cut me loose and I'll show you.

26:17.233 --> 26:18.910
Why did you attack us?

26:19.007 --> 26:20.760
You have something I want.

26:20.850 --> 26:22.917
- The drone?
- The sparks.

26:24.774 --> 26:27.818
Give them to me and I will let you go.

26:28.045 --> 26:29.847
You're the one who's tied up.

26:35.919 --> 26:39.731
If he tries anything, zap him.

26:49.099 --> 26:50.709
These symbols...

26:50.894 --> 26:52.910
Do you know what they mean?

26:53.803 --> 26:55.703
Confusing, isn't it?

26:55.977 --> 26:58.482
To wake in a world you do not know,

26:59.381 --> 27:02.070
Formed by creatures you
Do not understand.

27:02.238 --> 27:04.639
The symbols. Yes or no?

27:04.820 --> 27:07.057
We're wasting our time, ezra.

27:07.283 --> 27:08.922
She's right...

27:09.009 --> 27:10.352
Ezra.

27:10.453 --> 27:12.564
You're wasting your time.

27:19.229 --> 27:20.614
Well?

27:20.797 --> 27:22.520
An 11 on the crazy scale.

27:22.932 --> 27:24.433
He said there's no settlement.

27:24.503 --> 27:26.627
I'll believe the drone
Before I believe him.

27:26.970 --> 27:28.474
What did you see?

27:29.572 --> 27:31.091
I can't explain it.

27:31.241 --> 27:32.541
Try.

27:34.944 --> 27:36.797
Space.

27:36.905 --> 27:39.532
How big it is... Billions of galaxies.

27:39.622 --> 27:43.725
I could feel their size.

27:43.771 --> 27:45.899
And your own nothingness.

27:47.657 --> 27:50.336
That is what you felt, human.

27:51.094 --> 27:52.831
Your insignificance.

27:53.853 --> 27:57.525
You are but a speck of primary elements.

27:58.121 --> 27:59.729
Easily assembled...

27:59.816 --> 28:01.986
And easily destroyed.

28:04.350 --> 28:05.724
So you do know what these mean?

28:05.780 --> 28:07.297
You want the truth?

28:07.370 --> 28:11.683
Set me free and I will set you free.

28:19.762 --> 28:21.930
Does that symbol call to you, ezra?

28:21.997 --> 28:23.766
Have you seen it before?

28:29.799 --> 28:31.039
Watch out!

28:34.651 --> 28:37.575
That weapon is centuries
Beyond your understanding...

28:38.048 --> 28:39.136
Woman.

28:53.302 --> 28:55.155
A little tighter this time.

28:55.825 --> 28:57.425
You'll probably be able to free yourself.

28:57.449 --> 28:59.217
In a couple hours.

29:01.598 --> 29:03.439
You give me your water.

29:03.533 --> 29:05.100
A strong man would kill me.

29:05.227 --> 29:06.972
Then you're lucky I'm so weak.

29:07.637 --> 29:08.926
Don't follow us.

29:09.038 --> 29:10.969
You disappoint me, ezra.

29:11.507 --> 29:14.343
I thought you'd be more
Like your brother.

29:16.085 --> 29:21.169
If the sparks can rebuild
You, they can rebuild him.

29:22.595 --> 29:24.287
He's messing with us. Ignore him.

29:24.379 --> 29:26.088
I can take you to him.

29:26.200 --> 29:29.333
If you know my brother, say his name.

29:32.796 --> 29:33.969
Silas!

29:40.344 --> 29:41.560
Silas!

29:48.679 --> 29:51.996
Hey! Silas!

29:54.984 --> 29:56.327
I've been banging on the door.

29:56.394 --> 29:58.086
I was sleeping, obviously.

29:58.136 --> 30:00.102
In the middle of the day?

30:01.825 --> 30:03.258
I work nights now.

30:03.445 --> 30:05.049
At the mill?

30:05.261 --> 30:06.957
That didn't work out.

30:08.441 --> 30:10.041
I stuck my neck out to get you that job.

30:10.065 --> 30:12.323
Yeah, well, it didn't work out.

30:13.203 --> 30:14.837
Grab your things. We're leaving.

30:14.868 --> 30:16.948
As much as I'd love some big
Brother time right now,

30:16.986 --> 30:18.706
I think I'm just going
To go back to sleep.

30:18.730 --> 30:20.968
Do you have any idea what's going on?

30:23.118 --> 30:24.502
No, what's happened?

30:31.326 --> 30:33.266
Get in the car!

30:41.704 --> 30:43.375
What was that?

30:43.720 --> 30:45.322
We got to go!

30:59.222 --> 31:00.395
Silas!

31:04.907 --> 31:06.507
I'm waiting.

31:06.589 --> 31:09.007
You must love this brother.

31:10.700 --> 31:13.006
Such a weakness of humans.

31:15.564 --> 31:18.033
We'll come for the sparks, ezra.

31:19.108 --> 31:21.370
We will find you!

31:26.943 --> 31:29.033
How did you know how
To handle that weapon?

31:29.545 --> 31:32.190
I don't know. I just knew.

31:33.616 --> 31:35.722
Do you think he'll follow us?

31:35.908 --> 31:38.086
We're armed, he isn't.

31:38.187 --> 31:40.451
Then why not stop him? He's unstable.

31:42.025 --> 31:44.446
We find the settlement
Before he finds us.

31:44.567 --> 31:46.087
What if he's telling the truth?

31:46.129 --> 31:48.209
What if there is no settlement?

31:48.865 --> 31:51.873
Whoever put us here didn't
Put us here to die.

31:52.849 --> 31:56.167
I say we keep climbing to
A more elevated position,

31:56.659 --> 31:58.593
Try to see the settlement from there.

31:58.660 --> 32:01.144
A plan. I like it.

32:01.610 --> 32:03.438
It'll be dark soon.

32:04.007 --> 32:05.700
All the more reason to keep moving.

32:05.875 --> 32:07.276
If we don't find the settlement,

32:07.317 --> 32:08.834
We'll camp for the night,

32:08.891 --> 32:10.725
Keep looking in the morning.

32:11.487 --> 32:13.168
I should look at that wound again.

32:13.229 --> 32:14.548
I'm fine.

32:14.824 --> 32:17.150
I'll see a doctor when
We reach the settlement.

32:17.923 --> 32:19.545
If there is a settlement.

32:20.296 --> 32:21.764
Or a doctor.

33:18.901 --> 33:20.502
We'll camp here for the night.

33:20.590 --> 33:22.778
Don't bears live in caves?

33:23.259 --> 33:26.300
Not unless they're,
Like, desert bears, no.

33:28.104 --> 33:29.499
Yeah, funny.

33:45.148 --> 33:46.669
Let's see that wound.

33:47.016 --> 33:48.462
I'm fine.

33:49.685 --> 33:51.119
You really are an old man.

33:51.187 --> 33:52.422
Let him look at it.

34:03.275 --> 34:04.993
Has it been that way for a while?

34:05.018 --> 34:06.178
Why didn't you say something?

34:06.202 --> 34:08.654
It'll be fine.

34:08.737 --> 34:10.659
I'm going to try for the settlement.

34:10.732 --> 34:11.744
Bring someone back.

34:11.809 --> 34:12.839
No!

34:12.879 --> 34:15.047
We're safer if we stay together.

34:15.764 --> 34:17.784
I'll be good in the morning.

34:20.621 --> 34:22.827
Who's up for some seaweed?

34:49.598 --> 34:51.289
Took you long enough.

34:52.782 --> 34:54.668
There was three of them.

34:55.885 --> 34:58.131
I recorded their faces in my memory.

34:59.589 --> 35:01.406
Show me.

35:19.809 --> 35:20.809
Okay.

35:20.888 --> 35:23.153
This is the grossest
Thing I've ever eaten.

35:25.081 --> 35:27.482
Do you think they'll have
Donuts at the settlement?

35:27.650 --> 35:29.697
No civilization without
Creamfilled donuts.

35:29.772 --> 35:31.490
Is worth living in.

35:32.261 --> 35:33.461
Considering the terrain,

35:33.485 --> 35:35.770
You'll be lucky to get a cactus salad.

35:35.870 --> 35:37.331
Or prairie dog stew.

35:38.768 --> 35:40.769
I still don't see how
They could've made us.

35:40.850 --> 35:43.040
Wouldn't they need our dna or something?

35:44.167 --> 35:45.834
A complete set,

35:45.914 --> 35:48.147
Probably multiple copies.

35:48.671 --> 35:50.378
How would they get that?

35:51.427 --> 35:53.852
Fossil records, maybe?

35:54.677 --> 35:56.882
Assuming that bone marrow was preserved.

35:57.500 --> 35:59.534
They dug up old bones...

35:59.715 --> 36:01.737
I'm not saying it's likely.

36:02.027 --> 36:04.433
But getting our dna
Would be the easy part.

36:04.627 --> 36:07.682
The hard part would be
Capturing our brain state.

36:09.158 --> 36:10.885
How we think...

36:11.060 --> 36:12.138
Memories.

36:12.201 --> 36:14.435
Knowledge, basic motor function.

36:14.563 --> 36:17.021
Everything that makes us, us.

36:17.146 --> 36:19.814
Without that, we wouldn't
Be able to walk, talk...

36:19.902 --> 36:21.982
We'd have the mind of a newborn.

36:22.531 --> 36:25.254
But we don't. We're us.

36:26.309 --> 36:28.291
I remember my life.

36:28.544 --> 36:30.446
Don't you?

36:31.834 --> 36:33.467
Unfortunately.

36:35.691 --> 36:38.050
So, our brain states.

36:38.921 --> 36:40.490
How would they get those?

36:40.590 --> 36:42.555
From what's left of our brains?

36:42.678 --> 36:44.679
Nothing's left of our brains.

36:44.827 --> 36:48.219
After 400 years, we are
Just bones and dust.

36:49.332 --> 36:50.726
Then how?

36:54.170 --> 36:56.514
They must've recorded
Us while we were alive.

36:57.540 --> 36:59.788
They scanned our brains before we died?

36:59.909 --> 37:01.655
I think I'd remember that.

37:01.777 --> 37:03.403
Not if they didn't want you to.

37:04.407 --> 37:06.689
You think they cut out
Some of our memories?

37:07.717 --> 37:09.559
Everyone has gaps in their memories.

37:09.737 --> 37:12.709
If they removed a few, we
Wouldn't know a difference.

37:13.456 --> 37:15.572
How do you miss something
That you don't remember?

37:15.631 --> 37:17.550
You remember your wife.

37:21.531 --> 37:23.600
You mentioned two names before. I...

37:24.514 --> 37:27.089
I figured one of them must be your wife.

37:27.303 --> 37:29.571
So, we can talk about my life,

37:29.617 --> 37:32.190
But we can't ask questions about yours?

37:32.842 --> 37:34.762
I'm a hypocrite. Sue me.

37:37.246 --> 37:40.136
Lynn and kylie. My wife and daughter.

37:40.995 --> 37:42.229
I know it's a long shot,

37:42.254 --> 37:45.308
But maybe they'll be at the settlement.

37:46.662 --> 37:48.497
I'm counting on it.

38:14.884 --> 38:17.161
Okay, I think she finally fell asleep.

38:19.055 --> 38:20.438
The older she gets,

38:20.556 --> 38:22.633
The more she looks like you, you know.

38:23.559 --> 38:25.055
I see lynn in her.

38:25.294 --> 38:26.986
Not just physical features,

38:27.075 --> 38:30.341
But who lynn is, you know?

38:30.993 --> 38:32.711
And bits of me too.

38:34.804 --> 38:39.583
It's like she's us, except better.

38:42.845 --> 38:44.882
Thanks for coming to get me.

38:45.713 --> 38:49.384
Hey, nothing's going to
Break this family apart.

39:08.544 --> 39:09.567
<I>Ezra!</I>

39:09.592 --> 39:11.794
<I>Ezra, come quickly!</I>

39:17.780 --> 39:19.023
He's burning up.

39:29.959 --> 39:31.645
Grab the canister.

39:44.306 --> 39:46.268
Pour the sparks in the water!

40:02.091 --> 40:03.758
We don't know what these things can do.

40:03.879 --> 40:06.356
No, but I know what
Happens if we do nothing.

40:11.867 --> 40:13.984
Hold him!

40:16.165 --> 40:17.832
How do you know these won't kill him?

40:17.880 --> 40:19.547
I don't.

40:39.046 --> 40:40.596
Abram.

40:42.298 --> 40:45.107
A little ranch dressing would
Go a long way right now.

40:49.505 --> 40:50.840
I'm fine.

40:57.046 --> 40:58.441
Like a baby's bottom.

41:01.229 --> 41:03.012
I can't explain it either.

41:04.320 --> 41:06.791
Strangest part... There at the end,

41:08.384 --> 41:10.279
I didn't want to be healed.

41:11.026 --> 41:13.894
I could feel this
Infection inside of me.

41:14.997 --> 41:18.806
I knew it was there, but I welcomed it.

41:19.722 --> 41:21.627
You were delirious with fever.

41:22.845 --> 41:24.064
Maybe.

41:27.876 --> 41:29.200
Where's ezra?

41:30.371 --> 41:31.861
Scouted ahead.

41:31.886 --> 41:32.854
Turns out this tunnel.

41:32.879 --> 41:34.956
Cuts all the way through the mountain.

42:06.248 --> 42:08.451
Was that a miracle or was that science?

42:09.999 --> 42:11.758
Both, I think.

42:14.256 --> 42:16.153
Did you get any sleep?

42:16.358 --> 42:18.359
I'll sleep when we get there.

42:19.929 --> 42:21.985
Did you get the sparks
Back in the canister?

42:22.223 --> 42:24.359
They swam right back inside.

42:24.936 --> 42:27.084
'Course they did.

42:29.651 --> 42:31.051
You know that feeling when you wake.

42:31.075 --> 42:32.198
From a dream?

42:32.308 --> 42:34.856
And you're relieved to
Realize it was just a dream?

42:36.378 --> 42:38.640
I keep waiting for that to happen.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.812
Don't bother pinching yourself.

42:41.016 --> 42:42.461
I tried.

42:43.686 --> 42:45.389
Biggest mystery...

42:45.521 --> 42:47.870
Billions of people in the
History of the world:

42:48.037 --> 42:50.534
Philosophers, kings, inventors...

42:51.133 --> 42:53.108
And they bring back me.

42:53.662 --> 42:56.150
Well everyone deserves a second chance.

42:57.773 --> 42:58.974
Not me.

43:04.640 --> 43:06.931
Do you know how impossible this is?

43:07.423 --> 43:08.857
Bringing us back.

43:08.898 --> 43:11.032
How much intelligence that requires?

43:11.146 --> 43:12.730
How much effort.

43:12.849 --> 43:13.915
Why go to all that trouble.

43:13.939 --> 43:16.004
And then bring back the wrong people?

43:17.399 --> 43:19.427
Unless they chose us randomly.

43:21.229 --> 43:23.441
They put your memories
Back in your body.

43:24.152 --> 43:26.386
Does that seem random to you?

43:30.299 --> 43:31.626
I don't know you,

43:32.106 --> 43:33.883
I don't know what you've been through,

43:33.963 --> 43:35.043
What happened in your life,

43:35.067 --> 43:37.597
But if you want a better one,

43:38.407 --> 43:40.231
This is your chance.

43:41.717 --> 43:42.918
You're right.

43:42.963 --> 43:44.203
You don't know me.

43:54.589 --> 43:55.848
Is that it?

43:57.450 --> 43:58.794
It has to be.

44:03.541 --> 44:06.080
Well, another three or
Four hours of hiking.

44:06.181 --> 44:07.247
And we're there.

44:07.302 --> 44:08.862
More walking?

44:09.057 --> 44:10.953
Brilliant.

44:14.584 --> 44:16.024
How many people would you say.

44:16.048 --> 44:18.878
Are at this settlement,
Judging by the size of it?

44:19.948 --> 44:21.691
A few hundred, I hope.

44:21.784 --> 44:24.086
You need that many to
Mix up the gene pool.

44:24.586 --> 44:26.287
You are such a romantic.

44:26.506 --> 44:28.243
It's biology.

44:28.466 --> 44:30.071
We can't safely restart the species.

44:30.112 --> 44:32.046
Without a little genetic diversity.

44:32.160 --> 44:33.719
Wow.

44:33.940 --> 44:36.184
Is that how you wooed your wife?

44:36.265 --> 44:37.458
"Hey baby,."

44:37.499 --> 44:40.357
"What say me and you
Mix up the gene pool?"

44:40.769 --> 44:42.352
I was never that smooth.

44:42.604 --> 44:44.839
Do you think that's what
This is really about?

44:45.007 --> 44:46.956
Restoring the human race?

44:47.009 --> 44:48.390
You don't?

44:48.486 --> 44:49.793
Hold up.

44:49.878 --> 44:50.880
What?

44:50.946 --> 44:51.946
You hear that?

44:52.021 --> 44:54.010
I didn't hear anything.

44:56.629 --> 44:57.689
Run!

45:03.245 --> 45:04.445
Keep moving!

45:11.967 --> 45:13.546
They're gaining!

45:14.694 --> 45:15.770
What are you doing?

45:15.805 --> 45:16.911
Run to the settlement!

45:16.945 --> 45:18.851
- No!
- I'll be right behind you!

45:18.968 --> 45:20.031
Go!

45:23.883 --> 45:24.923
After them!

46:13.488 --> 46:14.823
Silas?

46:15.465 --> 46:17.352
- Open the door!
- Hey!

46:17.413 --> 46:18.428
Help us!

46:18.453 --> 46:19.634
If anyone's in there, open.

46:19.635 --> 46:20.635
Hey!

46:23.238 --> 46:25.118
Silas, listen to me...

46:25.240 --> 46:26.952
He's our brother now.

46:28.373 --> 46:29.697
- Hey!
- Hey!

46:29.978 --> 46:31.226
- Let us in!
- Open up!

46:31.280 --> 46:33.292
- Help us. Anybody!
- Open the door!

46:46.862 --> 46:48.182
Wait! Wait!

46:48.206 --> 46:50.442
Somebody's still out there!

46:53.335 --> 46:55.604
And you'll be our brother too.

47:00.442 --> 47:01.957
Grab hold.

47:17.277 --> 47:18.620
You all right?

47:25.133 --> 47:26.802
Get up!

47:41.109 --> 47:42.296
What is that?

47:42.401 --> 47:43.561
Shield barrier.

47:43.585 --> 47:45.319
The skin riders can't get inside.

47:45.344 --> 47:46.487
You're safe.

47:46.512 --> 47:48.471
Where are the other settlers?

47:52.427 --> 47:53.931
The people...

47:54.071 --> 47:55.446
Where are they?

47:55.704 --> 47:57.571
Follow me.

48:45.727 --> 48:47.841
The truck's not here.

48:52.848 --> 48:55.426
Mom? Dad?

48:55.590 --> 48:57.658
Grandma!

48:57.826 --> 48:59.171
<I>Grandma?</I>

49:13.608 --> 49:14.771
They're not here.

49:28.991 --> 49:30.426
Ezra!

49:38.700 --> 49:40.235
Come.

49:50.846 --> 49:53.051
There, north.

49:53.755 --> 49:56.400
134 settlers.

50:04.848 --> 50:06.675
What do you see?

50:07.356 --> 50:08.652
Graves.
