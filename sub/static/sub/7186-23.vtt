Ha-har!

01:02.062 --> 01:03.595
Ahoy, mateys!

01:03.597 --> 01:06.398
Do you want to join
my pirate crew?

01:07.700 --> 01:08.734
Great!

01:08.736 --> 01:10.402
To start today's adventure,

01:10.404 --> 01:13.172
everybody say
the Pirate Password.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.873
Yo-ho-ho!

01:14.875 --> 01:16.875
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:16.877 --> 01:18.410
One more time.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.479
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:23.950 --> 01:27.019
<i>[Jake]</i> Ahoy, Captain Smee!

01:27.021 --> 01:29.688
[Smee] Oh, dear,
oh, dear, oh, dear!

01:29.690 --> 01:33.525
Captain, sir,
coral reef, dead ahead!

01:33.527 --> 01:36.995
Don't bother me, Smee.
It's me tea time.

01:36.997 --> 01:40.833
[inhales deeply]
Ah... Darjeeling!

01:40.835 --> 01:43.168
- [rumbling]
- [shouts]

01:43.170 --> 01:46.772
[sputtering]
Thundering blunderbuss!

01:48.174 --> 01:49.975
We're sinking!

01:50.610 --> 01:52.377
To the dinghy!

01:52.379 --> 01:56.381
[stuttering] Captain,
I believe you're in my seat.

01:56.383 --> 01:59.985
You're the captain, and
according to the Pirate Code...

01:59.987 --> 02:03.088
[all] A captain always
goes down with his ship.

02:03.090 --> 02:04.756
You mean...

02:04.758 --> 02:09.495
...as captain I must stay aboard
the    <i>Jolly Rog</i>until it sinks?

02:09.497 --> 02:11.697
And I get terribly wet?!

02:11.699 --> 02:16.902
'Tis your responsibility.
Rules are rules, Captain.

02:16.904 --> 02:19.238
I hereby give up my command,

02:19.240 --> 02:22.808
and proclaim you...
Captain Smee!

02:22.810 --> 02:25.644
Me...? [stuttering] Captain?!

02:25.646 --> 02:28.180
Well, best of luck.
Ta-ta!

02:29.149 --> 02:31.984
[sighs] Captain Smee.

02:31.986 --> 02:35.354
Oh, I do enjoy
the sound of that...

02:35.356 --> 02:36.522
- [rumbling]
- Whoa!

02:36.524 --> 02:38.690
Oh, my. The ship's sinking.

02:38.692 --> 02:41.527
My ship's sinking!
I'm the captain now.

02:41.529 --> 02:44.429
What'll I do? What'll I do?

02:44.431 --> 02:47.699
Ahoy, mateys!
We're on a treasure hunt.

02:47.701 --> 02:49.801
Wanna help us find
the lost treasure

02:49.803 --> 02:51.803
of Captain Loon Doubloon?

02:51.805 --> 02:53.972
[Bones] Hello, popinjays!

02:53.974 --> 02:58.410
Don't miss your chance
to wave goodbye to Captain Smee!

02:58.412 --> 03:00.479
[all] Captain Smee?!

03:01.781 --> 03:04.183
[Jake] The <i>Jolly Roger</i>
<i>is sinking!</i>

03:04.185 --> 03:06.518
Looks like Smee
really is captain.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.054
And he's going down
with the ship!

03:09.056 --> 03:11.723
Aw, coconuts.
We gotta help him!

03:11.725 --> 03:13.325
New mission, mateys!

03:13.327 --> 03:16.295
Will you come with us
to help Captain Smee?

03:17.764 --> 03:18.864
Great!

03:18.866 --> 03:21.033
Keep a lookout
for gold doubloons.

03:21.035 --> 03:23.335
Whenever we solve
a pirate problem together,

03:23.337 --> 03:24.570
they'll appear.

03:24.572 --> 03:25.704
Then we'll collect 'em

03:25.706 --> 03:27.606
and put 'em in our
Team Treasure Chest.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.374
Is everybody ready?

03:29.376 --> 03:31.343
I got my sword!

03:31.345 --> 03:32.911
I got my map!

03:32.913 --> 03:35.047
And I've got my pixie dust!

03:35.049 --> 03:38.383
The fairies gave it to me
so that we can use it to fly.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.586
But only in emergencies.

03:44.424 --> 03:47.426
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away </i>

03:47.428 --> 03:49.895
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

03:49.897 --> 03:51.296
Let's go!

03:51.298 --> 03:54.933
<i>¶ Heave-ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

03:54.935 --> 03:57.736
<i>¶ Jake and</i>
<i>the Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

03:57.738 --> 03:59.805
<i>¶ And me </i>

04:02.242 --> 04:06.245
- [Jake] Ahoy, Captain Smee.
- Hello, sea pups!

04:06.247 --> 04:08.513
I'm in a terrible pickle.

04:08.515 --> 04:10.215
The ship is sinking,

04:10.217 --> 04:13.018
and Captain Hook
made me captain.

04:13.020 --> 04:16.221
Don't worry, Captain.
We're here to help!

04:16.223 --> 04:20.092
A sinking pirate ship
is definitely an emergency.

04:20.094 --> 04:22.427
Pixie dust away!

04:24.697 --> 04:26.565
[starfish] Boo-boo-boo.

04:26.567 --> 04:29.801
Oh-oh! Oh, my,
just as I thought.

04:29.803 --> 04:34.039
- We need to plug that hole!
- These sacks of tea might do.

04:35.208 --> 04:37.376
Ah... Darjeeling!

04:37.378 --> 04:39.244
That should keep
the ship afloat

04:39.246 --> 04:41.380
until I can
fix it for good.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.081
Thank you, sea pups.

04:43.083 --> 04:46.852
Yey-hey. We plugged up
the leaking <i>Jolly Roger,</i>

04:46.854 --> 04:50.722
saved Captain Smee,
and we got three gold doubloons!

04:50.724 --> 04:53.659
Let's grab 'em
and go back aboard Bucky.

04:55.561 --> 04:57.529
Most impressive, Smee.

04:57.531 --> 05:00.399
Of course,
I could have saved me ship

05:00.401 --> 05:04.269
without the help
of any puny pirates.

05:04.271 --> 05:07.839
Now, hand over me hat
and make me a fresh pot of tea.

05:07.841 --> 05:11.109
[stammering]
Sorry, Mr. Hook,

05:11.111 --> 05:14.313
but I am still
the captain. [chuckles]

05:14.315 --> 05:16.181
What?

05:16.183 --> 05:19.618
- I should make you walk the...
- Actually, Mr. Hook,

05:19.620 --> 05:22.954
Captain Smee could order you
to walk the plank.

05:22.956 --> 05:25.324
- [squeals]
- Captain Smee!

05:25.326 --> 05:27.693
Wanna join our
Never Land treasure hunt?

05:27.695 --> 05:29.294
We're searching
for the lost treasure

05:29.296 --> 05:30.962
of Captain Loon Doubloon!

05:30.964 --> 05:32.998
It's a legendary gold doubloon

05:33.000 --> 05:36.268
the size of
an extra large veggie pizza!

05:36.270 --> 05:40.505
Oh, I do love
treasure hunts... and pizza!

05:40.507 --> 05:42.974
Yeah, and if we find
the treasure,

05:42.976 --> 05:46.478
- we'll split it with you.
- Oh, how nice!

05:46.480 --> 05:49.348
Let the group
treasure hunt begin.

05:49.350 --> 05:52.117
Mr. Hook... set sail.

05:52.119 --> 05:56.288
Set sail...
Why I oughta...

05:58.257 --> 06:00.992
[Cubby] Hey, Jake!
We're approaching Wave Rock!

06:00.994 --> 06:03.562
A rock that looks like a wave?

06:03.564 --> 06:05.964
That's more dangerous
than a coral reef!

06:05.966 --> 06:07.899
Turn right, Bucky!

06:08.935 --> 06:11.303
Excuse me, Captain.

06:11.305 --> 06:15.407
- Is this bedsheet white enough?
- [coughing] Mr. Hook,

06:15.409 --> 06:19.478
it almost seems like you're
blocking my view on purpose!

06:19.480 --> 06:21.046
What?!

06:21.048 --> 06:23.949
Oh, why, that could
cause a shipwreck,

06:23.951 --> 06:27.719
making you give up command
and return me hat!

06:27.721 --> 06:30.555
- Never!
- [Bones] Captain Smee!

06:30.557 --> 06:32.824
There be somethin' funny ahead.

06:32.826 --> 06:36.628
It might be a rock...
that looks like a wave.

06:36.630 --> 06:40.832
Oh, dear, Wave Rock!
Turn right!

06:40.834 --> 06:42.167
[shouts]

06:46.005 --> 06:50.909
[grunts] Captain Smee,
wait for me!

06:53.045 --> 06:56.248
This way, mateys.
We're almost to the treasure!

06:56.250 --> 06:57.849
We just have to cross...

06:57.851 --> 07:02.053
- ...Bubbling Burp Bog.
- What an odd name.

07:02.055 --> 07:04.156
Why do you suppose
they called it...

07:04.158 --> 07:08.460
- [burp sounds]
- I see!

07:08.462 --> 07:12.230
It's going to be hard to cross
that log without laughing

07:12.232 --> 07:13.865
- and falling.
- [laughter continues]

07:13.867 --> 07:15.600
I know what we can do.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.869
Let's cover our ears,
like this.

07:17.871 --> 07:21.072
Then we won't be able
to hear the funny burps!

07:21.074 --> 07:24.109
- [burps sounds]
- We're almost there, crew!

07:24.111 --> 07:26.011
[laughing] Run!

07:28.080 --> 07:29.915
- We made it!
- Close one.

07:29.917 --> 07:32.884
Yo-ho!
We made it across.

07:32.886 --> 07:35.587
And we got
two more gold doubloons.

07:35.589 --> 07:37.656
Let's grab 'em and go.

07:39.358 --> 07:40.959
[Cubby] This "X" on the map

07:40.961 --> 07:43.595
shows the treasure is
somewhere in that valley.

07:43.597 --> 07:46.264
[Izzy] Look
for some kind of an "X", mateys.

07:46.266 --> 07:49.301
[gasps] I see it!

07:49.303 --> 07:50.836
Those two streams.

07:50.838 --> 07:53.472
They cross each other,
making an "X".

07:53.474 --> 07:56.708
Good eye, Captain Smee!
We did it, crew.

07:56.710 --> 08:00.779
We found the treasure, and we
got three more gold doubloons.

08:00.781 --> 08:02.714
Let's grab 'em and go.

08:02.716 --> 08:06.485
Hi-diddlee-doh,
come on, let's go!

08:06.487 --> 08:11.756
Imagine. Finding treasure
on my very first day as captain.

08:11.758 --> 08:14.059
- [chuckles]
- Careful, Captain Smee!

08:14.061 --> 08:16.127
Oh, dear.

08:16.129 --> 08:20.332
I seem to have tripped some sort
of a pirate booby trap!

08:20.334 --> 08:25.337
- [rumbling]
- [all shouting]

08:26.272 --> 08:28.707
Crackers!
Is everybody OK?

08:28.709 --> 08:31.776
I think so. We've all
got a grip on something.

08:31.778 --> 08:34.679
- Izzy, some pixie dust?
- I...

08:34.681 --> 08:38.083
- [straining] I can't reach it!
- Well, well, well.

08:38.085 --> 08:42.487
It looks like I am the only one
capable of saving...

08:42.489 --> 08:44.055
...the treasure!

08:45.157 --> 08:49.027
Mr. Hook, I order you
to forget that treasure

08:49.029 --> 08:50.996
and save us first!

08:50.998 --> 08:54.099
I scoff at your order, Captain!

08:54.101 --> 08:57.168
I want the treasure
all for meself.

08:57.170 --> 08:59.304
Oh... Oh, dear!

08:59.306 --> 09:00.939
- Oh!
- I gotcha.

09:00.941 --> 09:03.808
I gotcha.
I don't gotcha.

09:03.810 --> 09:05.944
I've gotcha, Captain.

09:05.946 --> 09:09.281
- Grab on.
- Oh, my, oh, my.

09:09.283 --> 09:10.882
Hurry!

09:11.450 --> 09:13.318
Yey-hey, this way!

09:14.420 --> 09:16.454
- Save us!
- Save me!

09:16.456 --> 09:18.390
[motor sputtering]

09:19.859 --> 09:20.859
We made it!

09:20.861 --> 09:22.561
- We're saved!
- Aw, coconuts!

09:22.563 --> 09:25.664
Thank you ever so much,
Captain Hook.

09:25.666 --> 09:30.235
"Captain Hook"?
Don't you mean "Mr. Hook"?

09:30.237 --> 09:31.903
Not at all, sir.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.706
I hereby
give up my command.

09:34.708 --> 09:37.509
[stuttering]
But I don't understand.

09:37.511 --> 09:41.246
Being captain is
about taking responsibility,

09:41.248 --> 09:44.716
and just now, sir,
you took responsibility,

09:44.718 --> 09:46.851
just as I knew you would!

09:46.853 --> 09:49.154
Let's hear it
for Captain Hook!

09:49.156 --> 09:51.122
[all] Hurray!

09:51.124 --> 09:54.960
Wait! Said captain
is not yet done.

09:58.264 --> 10:01.833
Behold
the Captain Loon Doubloon!

10:01.835 --> 10:04.936
Wow!
Thanks, Captain Hook.

10:04.938 --> 10:08.273
It really is the size
of an extra large pizza.

10:08.275 --> 10:12.143
Look! It's divided
into eight pizza-like pieces!

10:12.145 --> 10:13.912
One for each of us.

10:13.914 --> 10:18.717
I... I...
I got some treasure!

10:18.719 --> 10:21.886
We all did, sir.
We all did.

10:21.888 --> 10:27.092
Argh, mateys, pirates
love pizzas-of-eight!

10:27.094 --> 10:29.961
[all laughing]

10:33.265 --> 10:34.766
Thanks for helping
Captain Smee

10:34.768 --> 10:36.434
and Captain Hook, mateys!

10:36.436 --> 10:38.436
Now let's put all
our gold doubloons

10:38.438 --> 10:40.605
into our Team Treasure Chest.

10:47.880 --> 10:50.215
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

10:50.217 --> 10:52.117
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

10:52.119 --> 10:54.185
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>With help from you ¶</i>

10:54.187 --> 10:57.088
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

10:57.090 --> 10:59.424
Come on. Count with us.

11:00.459 --> 11:01.926
[all] Yeah!

11:03.229 --> 11:05.530
[Izzy] One, two, three...

11:05.532 --> 11:09.968
[Cubby] Four, five,
six, seven, eight!

11:09.970 --> 11:13.338
Yo-ho! For solving
pirate problems today,

11:13.340 --> 11:16.841
we got eight gold doubloons.

11:16.843 --> 11:19.444
Those pizza-slice pieces
of the treasure

11:19.446 --> 11:23.548
sure did make me hungry. So...

11:23.550 --> 11:28.353
One extra large pineapple,
kiwi, jicama, pomegranate pizza

11:28.355 --> 11:30.822
for me and my mateys!

11:30.824 --> 11:35.226
Finally! Treasure we can
really sink our teeth into.

11:38.064 --> 11:39.631
Ah, Smee,

11:39.633 --> 11:42.434
it's good to be back
in command of the <i>Jolly Roger.</i>

11:42.436 --> 11:43.702
Captain Hook, sir.

11:43.704 --> 11:46.604
What should I do
with these soggy sacks of tea?

11:46.606 --> 11:48.773
They were stuck
in a hole down below.

11:48.775 --> 11:49.507
[ship creaking]

11:52.178 --> 11:55.146
Oh, dear, we're sinking again.

11:55.148 --> 11:57.082
To the dinghy!

11:58.417 --> 12:03.555
- Captain Bones!
- Well, best of luck. Ta-ta!

12:03.557 --> 12:05.724
Oh, I always
wanted to be captain!

12:05.726 --> 12:07.392
First I'm gonna...

12:07.394 --> 12:10.361
I'm gonna have an
all-I-can-eat-ice cream feast!

12:10.363 --> 12:13.231
And then I'll invite
all me best mates!

12:15.134 --> 12:16.968
<i>[Jack]</i> Captain Croak!

12:17.636 --> 12:20.238
[Cubby] Coconuts, away!

12:20.240 --> 12:21.706
Whoo-hoo!

12:24.009 --> 12:26.211
Cubby,
no more coconuts!

12:26.213 --> 12:29.147
- We've got enough.
- Aw, coconuts!

12:29.149 --> 12:31.182
You can never have
enough coconuts!

12:31.184 --> 12:32.684
[Hook] A-ha!

12:32.686 --> 12:36.087
I knew those puny pirates
were up to something,

12:36.089 --> 12:40.125
and by "something"
I mean "findin' treasure."

12:40.127 --> 12:43.528
I think they're just
collecting coconuts, Captain.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.396
That's what they
want us to think,

12:45.398 --> 12:47.298
but it's a puny pirate trick.

12:47.300 --> 12:50.502
Ah. We shall wait right here

12:50.504 --> 12:53.605
until I see
what they're really up to.

12:53.607 --> 12:55.840
[sighs] Aye, aye.

12:55.842 --> 12:58.576
[sighs] I bet
this be a long wait.

12:58.578 --> 13:01.146
Well, I know
how we can pass the time.

13:01.148 --> 13:05.316
With one of me favorite hobbies,
doing magic tricks!

13:05.318 --> 13:08.620
- Ooh, how exciting!
- [clears throat]

13:08.622 --> 13:11.422
Watch as I say
me magic words,

13:11.424 --> 13:14.859
and turn Sharky
into a frog!

13:14.861 --> 13:16.194
You can do that?

13:16.196 --> 13:19.197
I don't know.
I never tried.

13:19.199 --> 13:20.298
Oh, dear!

13:20.300 --> 13:22.233
I don't know
if I can watch this!

13:22.235 --> 13:23.635
Ooh, me neither!

13:23.637 --> 13:26.538
Ooh, the little swabbies
are on the move!

13:26.540 --> 13:30.809
Abuh-ree-pirate,
cada-buh-ree!

13:30.811 --> 13:32.911
- [croaks]
- [screams]

13:34.647 --> 13:37.949
- Help me!
- Oh, dear...

13:37.951 --> 13:40.251
Bones, it worked!

13:40.253 --> 13:43.288
But you didn't turn
Sharky into a frog.

13:43.290 --> 13:46.224
You turned
Captain Hook into a frog!

13:46.226 --> 13:48.927
Oh... Sorry, Captain!

13:48.929 --> 13:50.962
- [croaks]
- Captain!

13:50.964 --> 13:54.532
[Hook] Smee, come get me! Hurry!

13:54.534 --> 13:56.534
We're coming, Captain!

13:57.937 --> 14:01.439
Where are
those blasted bumpkins going?

14:01.441 --> 14:03.241
Help!

14:05.344 --> 14:07.345
[slurping]

14:07.347 --> 14:09.047
[exhales]

14:09.049 --> 14:12.784
There's nothing
like fresh coconut milk.

14:12.786 --> 14:15.386
- [croaks]
- Ahoy, Mr. Frog.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.422
Would you like
some coconut milk?

14:17.424 --> 14:19.624
Excuse me, sea pups,

14:19.626 --> 14:23.428
but this frog is a matter
of great importance.

14:23.430 --> 14:26.731
- [croaks]
- What's so important
about this frog?

14:26.733 --> 14:30.335
Oh, that's no frog,
that's Captain Hook!

14:30.337 --> 14:34.539
- Yay-hey, no way!
- It's all me own fault.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.507
I accidentally
turned the captain

14:36.509 --> 14:40.011
- into a frog with me magic!
- Well...

14:40.013 --> 14:43.014
I'm not so sure
that your wand is magic, Bones,

14:43.016 --> 14:45.450
but we'll help you catch
the frog if you'd like.

14:45.452 --> 14:48.820
Really, truly?
Oh! Oh, me thanks you!

14:48.822 --> 14:53.057
Mateys, wanna help us catch
Captain Hook the Frog?

14:54.760 --> 14:55.894
Great!

14:55.896 --> 14:58.329
Let's all keep a lookout
for gold doubloons.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.765
Whenever we solve
a pirate problem together,

15:00.767 --> 15:02.033
they'll appear.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.101
Then we'll collect 'em

15:03.103 --> 15:05.737
and put 'em
in our Team Treasure Chest.

15:05.739 --> 15:09.040
Yo-ho, let's go catch
Captain Hook!

15:09.042 --> 15:13.344
You mean Captain Croak.
[laughs]

15:16.248 --> 15:19.317
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away </i>

15:19.319 --> 15:21.986
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

15:21.988 --> 15:23.354
Let's go!

15:23.356 --> 15:26.557
<i>¶ Heave-ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

15:26.559 --> 15:29.460
<i>¶ Jake and</i>
<i>the Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

15:29.462 --> 15:31.562
<i>¶ And me </i>

15:34.133 --> 15:37.669
Shiver me timbers!
Where did that frog go?

15:37.671 --> 15:39.904
Captain Croak, dead ahead.

15:42.574 --> 15:44.208
Follow that frog!

15:44.210 --> 15:46.644
[Izzy] Slow down,
Captain Hook Frog!

15:46.646 --> 15:49.280
[Smee] We can't help you
if we can't catch you.

15:50.049 --> 15:51.849
Here, froggy, froggy.

15:51.851 --> 15:53.351
Look alive, me hearties,

15:53.353 --> 15:55.687
Captain Croak
is hoppin' our way!

15:55.689 --> 15:58.856
It's the Tic-Tock Croc!

15:58.858 --> 16:00.858
- [Skully] Crackers!
- [shouting]

16:00.860 --> 16:03.795
- [yelling]
- [growling]

16:05.464 --> 16:07.398
Captain, come back!

16:07.400 --> 16:09.167
Oh, dear.

16:09.169 --> 16:10.268
[shouts]

16:11.036 --> 16:13.137
Oh... [chuckles]
Thank you.

16:13.139 --> 16:15.907
But I lost the captain.

16:15.909 --> 16:19.577
- [growls]
- And old Tic-Tock found us.

16:20.245 --> 16:22.080
Bust me barnacles!

16:22.082 --> 16:23.781
If we don't do
something fast,

16:23.783 --> 16:26.150
we're gonna end up
in the croc's rumblin' tummy!

16:28.253 --> 16:30.455
Hmm, he sounds hungry.

16:30.457 --> 16:33.191
Maybe if we give him
a snack, he'll go away.

16:33.193 --> 16:36.494
Coconuts!
Maybe he'd like coconuts!

16:36.496 --> 16:40.765
Great idea, Cubby.
Oh, Tic-Tock Croc!

16:40.767 --> 16:43.835
How about a snack? Catch!

16:46.271 --> 16:47.605
Hmm?

16:47.607 --> 16:49.841
[chuckling]

16:49.843 --> 16:51.242
All right!

16:51.244 --> 16:55.213
We got the croc to go away,
and we got three gold doubloons!

16:55.215 --> 16:58.216
Let's grab 'em
and go find Captain Croak.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.653
Oh, dear...

17:02.655 --> 17:05.623
How will we ever
find the captain now?

17:05.625 --> 17:06.991
[frog croaking]

17:06.993 --> 17:09.327
[gasps] There he is!
He's up in the tree.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.062
I'll get him.

17:11.064 --> 17:14.365
Look, the little fella's
right here.

17:15.467 --> 17:16.801
Careful, Bones!

17:16.803 --> 17:20.171
The captain's a might jumpy
today, bein' a frog and all.

17:20.173 --> 17:24.409
- [croaking]
- It's OK, Captain.

17:24.411 --> 17:27.545
Come to old Bonesy.

17:29.148 --> 17:31.849
- [shouts]
- [croaks]

17:31.851 --> 17:33.484
Swash me buckle!

17:33.486 --> 17:35.853
Now the captain
is a flyin' frog!

17:35.855 --> 17:38.556
We need to catch him...
and fast!

17:39.958 --> 17:41.392
Going down.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.327
I know
how we can catch him,

17:43.329 --> 17:45.630
with my coconut collecting net.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.600
Yey-hey! We caught
Captain Croak,

17:49.602 --> 17:52.070
and we got three more
gold doubloons.

17:52.072 --> 17:54.439
Let's grab 'em
and go find a way

17:54.441 --> 17:57.275
to change the frog back
into Captain Hook.

17:58.210 --> 18:00.144
Here ya go, Mr. Smee.

18:00.146 --> 18:03.581
- Oh, Captain, you're back!
- Quickly, Bones!

18:03.583 --> 18:06.517
Change Hook the Frog
back into Hook the Captain.

18:06.519 --> 18:09.253
Hurry! Before he hops off again.

18:09.255 --> 18:12.090
Uh... [stammering]
I don't know if I can do it.

18:12.092 --> 18:13.691
You gotsta, Bones.

18:13.693 --> 18:17.462
With great power, comes
great responsi-muh-bility.

18:17.464 --> 18:21.365
- 'Tis an old piratey saying.
- All right, all right.

18:21.367 --> 18:22.867
Here goes nothing.

18:22.869 --> 18:25.937
Abuh-ree-pirate,
cada-buh-ree!

18:26.638 --> 18:28.473
[groans] One more time.

18:28.475 --> 18:32.043
Abuh-ree-pirate,
cada-buh-ree!

18:32.678 --> 18:34.812
- [croaks]
- Uh-oh.

18:34.814 --> 18:37.048
The captain
is still a croaker.

18:37.050 --> 18:40.618
Oh, dear, oh, dear.
This is terrible.

18:40.620 --> 18:44.655
I'm never gonna do
a magic trick ever, ever again.

18:44.657 --> 18:47.792
You know, maybe we need
to talk to someone else

18:47.794 --> 18:49.393
who knows
something about magic.

18:49.395 --> 18:51.829
Misty, the wonderful witch!

18:53.732 --> 18:57.068
And that's how I turned
the captain into a frog

18:57.070 --> 18:59.237
with me magic wand!

18:59.239 --> 19:01.305
Magic wand, really?

19:01.307 --> 19:03.741
Why I seen it
with me own two eyes!

19:03.743 --> 19:08.112
[giggles] Well, I'm not
so sure about that.

19:08.114 --> 19:10.982
But look at Captain Hook,
he's all froggied up!

19:10.984 --> 19:13.184
Let's see what
I can do to help you.

19:13.186 --> 19:16.420
By the power of flowers
and babbling brooks,

19:16.422 --> 19:19.557
this frog must turn itself
back into Hook.

19:21.727 --> 19:23.594
Oh, that's not good.

19:23.596 --> 19:26.631
- Oh, no, captain!
- Oh, , oh, oh! No, no, wait!

19:26.633 --> 19:28.399
Come back! Oh, my...

19:28.401 --> 19:30.801
They all left
before I could tell them.

19:30.803 --> 19:33.104
That frog
isn't Captain Hook.

19:33.106 --> 19:34.772
It's just a frog!

19:34.774 --> 19:37.675
You mean Bones
isn't a magician?

19:37.677 --> 19:41.379
- I knew it!
- It'll be OK, Captain.

19:41.381 --> 19:44.215
You just have to let us
find you first.

19:44.217 --> 19:46.350
Oh, dear!

19:46.352 --> 19:49.620
[all croaking]

19:49.622 --> 19:52.823
Frog Hollow is full of... frogs!

19:52.825 --> 19:55.359
[Sharky] Uh, which one
is the captain?

19:55.361 --> 19:57.695
Ribbit. [moans]

19:57.697 --> 19:58.829
[thuds]

19:58.831 --> 20:00.331
Oh, dear.

20:01.833 --> 20:04.835
So if that frog
is just a frog,

20:04.837 --> 20:06.837
then where is
Captain Hook?

20:06.839 --> 20:08.539
Maybe he's in trouble!

20:08.541 --> 20:12.977
Maybe? He's Captain Hook,
of course he's in trouble!

20:12.979 --> 20:14.679
Let's find out.

20:15.747 --> 20:19.116
By the power of raindrops
and falling snow,

20:19.118 --> 20:22.453
reveal to us now,
where did Captain Hook go?

20:24.456 --> 20:28.526
- Help me!
- [all gasp] Captain Hook?!

20:28.528 --> 20:32.363
Zounds! Hook's clinging
to the Never Land Cliffs.

20:32.365 --> 20:34.298
This is an emergency!

20:34.300 --> 20:37.635
Then it's time to use
a little magic of my own.

20:37.637 --> 20:39.704
Pixie dust away!

20:39.706 --> 20:44.342
- Thanks for your help, Misty.
- Oh, you're welcome. Anytime!

20:47.813 --> 20:52.183
[groans, straining]
Blasted vines! Whoo!

20:54.653 --> 20:57.722
- [screaming]
- [all] Gotcha!

21:00.058 --> 21:03.894
- There you go, Captain Hook.
- Now to find me crew.

21:03.896 --> 21:06.530
Oh, those blasted bumblers.

21:06.532 --> 21:09.066
Yay-hey!
We saved Captain Hook,

21:09.068 --> 21:11.802
and we got
three more gold doubloons.

21:11.804 --> 21:15.206
Let's grab 'em
and go back to Pirate Island!

21:19.611 --> 21:20.778
Thanks for helping us

21:20.780 --> 21:23.314
on our froggy adventure
today, mateys.

21:23.316 --> 21:25.416
Now let's put
all our gold doubloons

21:25.418 --> 21:27.685
into our Team Treasure Chest.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.695
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

21:37.697 --> 21:39.630
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

21:39.632 --> 21:41.766
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>With help from you ¶</i>

21:41.768 --> 21:44.669
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

21:44.671 --> 21:46.971
Come on. Count with us.

21:48.206 --> 21:49.573
[all] Yeah!

21:50.709 --> 21:53.044
[Jake] One, two, three...

21:53.046 --> 21:55.479
[Cubby] Four, five, six...

21:55.481 --> 21:59.550
- [Izzy] Seven, eight, nine!
- [Jake] Yo-ho!

21:59.552 --> 22:01.652
For solving
pirate problems today,

22:01.654 --> 22:04.121
we got nine gold doubloons!

22:04.990 --> 22:06.090
[croaks]

22:06.092 --> 22:09.827
Crackers! Cubby's
been turned into a frog.

22:09.829 --> 22:12.029
Oh, really?

22:12.031 --> 22:14.799
Fooled ya! [chortles]

22:14.801 --> 22:17.501
[all laugh]

22:20.072 --> 22:21.939
Oh, woe!

22:21.941 --> 22:24.842
We'll never find
the dear old captain.

22:24.844 --> 22:29.113
Say, maybe I can find him
with the right magic spell.

22:29.115 --> 22:31.082
Be careful, Bones.

22:31.084 --> 22:34.919
Abraca-whammy, frog warts away!

22:34.921 --> 22:37.555
[snoring, ticking]

22:38.290 --> 22:40.091
[growls]

22:40.093 --> 22:42.927
- Whoops.
- [Hook] What is this?

22:42.929 --> 22:48.432
- Some sort of a pond picnic?
- [gasps] Me magic worked!

22:48.434 --> 22:50.801
- Captain!
- You're back!

22:50.803 --> 22:54.138
- [growling]
- [screams]

22:54.673 --> 22:56.841
Smee!

22:56.843 --> 23:00.811
It could be worse, Captain,
you could still be a frog!

23:00.813 --> 23:03.981
[Hook] Stop yammering
and save me!
