00:02.770 --> 00:04.381
Previously on Teen Wolf...

00:04.405 --> 00:06.249
Stiles, don't say anything.

00:06.273 --> 00:08.474
Why not? Because I never
said anything about Donovan.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.124
Chimeras.

00:14.148 --> 00:15.668
Just close your eyes
for three seconds.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.528
She's got this aura around her.

00:18.552 --> 00:20.112
I don't know if
I can trust her anymore.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.411
I know what happened to Donovan.

00:32.633 --> 00:33.699
I know everything...

00:38.272 --> 00:39.338
You don't know anything.

00:40.508 --> 00:42.252
I was there.

00:42.276 --> 00:43.675
I was at the library.

00:44.645 --> 00:46.223
Malia found the book.

00:46.247 --> 00:47.691
She was texting us
to see where you were.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.760
She said she left you
at the library.

00:49.784 --> 00:51.561
I told her I was close.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.625
When I got there, I heard
the scaffolding come down.

00:54.155 --> 00:55.165
You saw him?

00:55.189 --> 00:56.622
Just the body.

01:00.528 --> 01:01.560
I watched you come out.

01:03.197 --> 01:05.316
I was gonna say something,
but then I saw the cop car.

01:08.469 --> 01:09.635
And the body was gone.

01:11.839 --> 01:13.350
I don't know who took him.

01:13.374 --> 01:14.751
I only saw what you saw,

01:14.775 --> 01:16.535
and I didn't say anything
because you didn't.

01:22.783 --> 01:24.023
That's not an ambulance, is it?

01:27.121 --> 01:28.387
We should get out of here.

01:33.160 --> 01:34.170
We can't just leave him.

01:34.194 --> 01:35.474
Fine. All right, let's take him.

01:36.730 --> 01:38.508
Someone's stealing the
bodies anyway, right?

01:38.532 --> 01:40.232
Here's our chance
to find out who.

01:41.769 --> 01:42.769
Stiles, come on.

01:43.871 --> 01:45.104
We gotta do something.

01:45.573 --> 01:46.683
You killed him.

01:46.707 --> 01:47.773
In self-defense.

01:49.176 --> 01:50.742
He was going to kill you and me.

01:51.579 --> 01:53.223
If we stay,

01:53.247 --> 01:54.758
we're either going to
have to tell the truth

01:54.782 --> 01:56.748
or we're going to need
a pretty convincing story.

02:00.488 --> 02:01.587
It's your choice.

02:03.757 --> 02:05.591
I'm not going to ask you
to lie to your dad.

02:07.695 --> 02:09.828
Don't worry. I've had
plenty of practice.

02:17.171 --> 02:19.249
Hayden... Hayden, wait.

02:19.273 --> 02:21.118
Asking me to close
my eyes was weird.

02:21.142 --> 02:22.586
Sticking a glow stick in
my face, even weirder.

02:22.610 --> 02:24.221
But werewolves and dead doctors?

02:24.245 --> 02:25.455
Dread Doctors. Whatever.

02:25.479 --> 02:26.756
Get away from me.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.258
What if I could prove it to you?

02:28.282 --> 02:29.715
Prove what? This.

03:16.931 --> 03:19.831
Your condition improves.

04:32.473 --> 04:33.739
Hayden...

04:34.041 --> 04:35.307
Hayden...

04:36.877 --> 04:37.877
Hayden...

04:48.389 --> 04:49.389
Come... Come on!

05:35.402 --> 05:36.402
Do you know him?

05:36.737 --> 05:37.803
His name's Josh.

05:38.772 --> 05:39.838
He was a junior.

05:48.916 --> 05:50.816
Which one did it?
The one with the cane?

05:53.387 --> 05:54.664
Yeah.

05:54.688 --> 05:55.899
What are we going
to do with him?

05:55.923 --> 05:57.467
We can't just set
the alarm and leave.

05:57.491 --> 05:59.703
That's how Tracy disappeared.

05:59.727 --> 06:01.567
All right, someone's
got to stay here with him.

06:03.931 --> 06:04.996
I'll do it.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.822
It's not like I had a big
Saturday night planned.

06:15.709 --> 06:16.986
What is it?

06:17.010 --> 06:18.010
Another one.

06:18.812 --> 06:19.878
Another Chimera.

06:25.652 --> 06:27.686
Hayden? It's Scott.

06:29.390 --> 06:30.900
I know that you're
scared, but we just...

06:30.924 --> 06:31.990
We want to help.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.575
I can hear her heart beating.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.076
She's really freaked out.
What happened?

06:40.100 --> 06:41.578
She was okay when we got here.

06:41.602 --> 06:42.746
I went to text you
for two seconds

06:42.770 --> 06:43.847
and she locked herself in.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.682
Why? I don't know.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.884
She's definitely a Chimera?

06:47.908 --> 06:49.419
She said she heard
a voice saying,

06:49.443 --> 06:50.709
"Your condition improves."

06:51.979 --> 06:52.979
Okay, that's unsettling.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.492
Hayden.

06:55.516 --> 06:57.394
This is Stiles.

06:57.418 --> 06:59.462
Your sister works for my
dad down at the station.

06:59.486 --> 07:01.420
Look, just open the door,
okay? You can trust us.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.904
We just need to tell
you the truth, Hayden.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.507
And that kind of thing
usually is better face-to-face.

07:10.531 --> 07:11.908
Listen, either you're
gonna unlock the door

07:11.932 --> 07:13.432
or I'm gonna have
to break it open.

07:14.468 --> 07:16.012
It's okay if you
don't want to talk,

07:16.036 --> 07:17.414
or if you're not
ready to believe us.

07:17.438 --> 07:18.438
But I just...

07:19.873 --> 07:21.440
I gotta know that
you're okay in there.

07:44.531 --> 07:45.664
I believe you.

07:52.172 --> 07:55.084
Was this really necessary on
a Saturday morning, Dad?

07:55.108 --> 07:57.620
Thank you for your help, Kira.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.077
Not like you gave me a choice,

07:59.513 --> 08:00.645
but sure.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.463
There's one more in the car.

08:06.487 --> 08:07.487
I'll be right back.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.271
Mom? What the hell?

08:31.545 --> 08:33.523
Kira. Where's your sword?

08:33.547 --> 08:35.614
I, um... I think I left it...

08:44.191 --> 08:46.002
Mom, this isn't
what I would call

08:46.026 --> 08:47.570
quality mother-daughter time.

08:47.594 --> 08:48.860
Kira,

08:49.663 --> 08:50.695
defend yourself.

09:50.691 --> 09:51.756
Kira!

09:52.960 --> 09:54.025
Kira!

10:04.371 --> 10:05.604
I could've killed you!

10:06.239 --> 10:07.239
Not you.

10:08.075 --> 10:09.641
The fox inside you.

10:35.168 --> 10:36.234
Mason?

10:41.241 --> 10:42.273
You're Mason, right?

10:43.010 --> 10:45.176
Yeah. You're Corey.

10:47.014 --> 10:49.626
You saw Lucas that night.

10:49.650 --> 10:51.250
My friend said he saw
you talking to him.

10:52.019 --> 10:53.396
Yeah, uh...

10:53.420 --> 10:55.064
I met him

10:55.088 --> 10:58.134
that night. He
was, uh, really cool.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.937
Look, I'm sorry
about what happened.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.171
Did he say anything?

11:02.195 --> 11:04.162
About me? About what happened?

11:05.032 --> 11:06.776
Sorry.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.945
I mean, I already told
the cops everything I know.

11:08.969 --> 11:10.168
Which wasn't much.

11:10.937 --> 11:12.237
I'm... I'm really sorry.

11:28.922 --> 11:31.034
We're back to telluric currents?

11:31.058 --> 11:32.835
If the Dread Doctors didn't
like coming into Eichen House

11:32.859 --> 11:34.904
because of them, maybe we
can use them to protect Hayden.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.272
Okay, so, besides Eichen,

11:36.296 --> 11:37.616
where's the strongest
convergence?

11:38.398 --> 11:40.343
We're standing on it.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.944
You want to hide her in the
high school? For how long?

11:41.968 --> 11:43.902
If we have to, all night.

11:46.273 --> 11:48.217
Liam convinced Hayden

11:48.241 --> 11:50.086
not to say anything
to her sister yet.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.188
She's working a double tonight,

11:52.212 --> 11:53.356
and she thinks Hayden's
staying at a friend's.

11:53.380 --> 11:54.924
But it's just a school though.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.726
You know, it's not
exactly a fortress.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.695
Lydia's got an idea for that.

11:58.719 --> 12:00.029
Remember how
Valack quoted Tesla?

12:00.053 --> 12:01.731
Frequency and vibration.

12:01.755 --> 12:04.067
She thinks he wasn't saying
that just to sound smart.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.702
She thinks maybe it was a clue.

12:05.726 --> 12:06.726
To do what?

12:07.327 --> 12:09.472
Disrupt their frequency.

12:09.496 --> 12:11.908
Parrish took three cell phone
jammers from the station.

12:11.932 --> 12:14.165
He thinks he can broaden
their range of frequency.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.267
It's a long shot,

12:18.171 --> 12:19.651
but it's the best
we've got right now.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.372
What about me?

12:24.311 --> 12:26.344
Um, well, you'll come
to the school with us.

12:27.848 --> 12:28.825
We're going to need all
the help that we can get,

12:28.849 --> 12:30.126
so bring your belt.

12:30.150 --> 12:33.329
Actually, I think
I lost it again.

12:33.353 --> 12:35.298
Oh, well, I'll help you find it.

12:35.322 --> 12:36.199
You think you left it here?

12:36.223 --> 12:38.356
Scott, it's okay.

12:40.761 --> 12:43.106
Last time I was around
telluric currents,

12:43.130 --> 12:44.262
things didn't go so well.

12:45.232 --> 12:46.743
Yeah well, this is the school.

12:46.767 --> 12:47.866
You're there every day.

12:48.301 --> 12:49.812
It's not the same.

12:49.836 --> 12:51.336
I made it worse
by being at Eichen.

12:53.173 --> 12:54.472
They used me to get inside.

12:56.209 --> 12:57.820
I think I need to figure out
what's going on with me

12:57.844 --> 12:59.444
before I try helping
anyone else.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.280
Kira...

13:36.817 --> 13:38.049
Just be careful, okay?

13:50.997 --> 13:52.163
If this works tonight,

13:52.966 --> 13:55.077
what happens tomorrow?

13:55.101 --> 13:56.979
Are you gonna keep trying
to find places to hide her?

13:57.003 --> 13:58.069
No.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.339
If this works tonight,

14:03.476 --> 14:05.043
we're gonna catch one of them.

14:24.331 --> 14:25.430
Checking up on me?

14:29.502 --> 14:31.047
You can't tell me
you don't want to know

14:31.071 --> 14:32.381
who's taking the bodies.

14:32.405 --> 14:33.504
Inconsequential.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.273
Why?

14:37.477 --> 14:38.988
You don't care that
someone's running off

14:39.012 --> 14:41.045
with your little failed
science experiments?

14:44.084 --> 14:45.450
You already know
who's taking them.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.932
Did you forget that you
were supposed to be

14:49.956 --> 14:51.500
keeping me in
the loop on everything?

14:51.524 --> 14:53.169
Inconsequential.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.259
Not to me!

15:05.472 --> 15:08.017
What's going on?

15:08.041 --> 15:09.619
Whoever's stealing the bodies
probably isn't going to do it

15:09.643 --> 15:11.320
while we're standing
guard over one of them.

15:11.344 --> 15:12.464
So you've got a better idea?

15:31.264 --> 15:32.375
What happens now?

15:32.399 --> 15:33.598
We wait.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.313
You want to take
shifts watching?

15:37.337 --> 15:39.504
No, no. I want to spend
some quality time with you.

15:42.108 --> 15:43.975
Sounds good to me.

16:04.531 --> 16:07.365
The balance of power
inside you is in conflict.

16:08.435 --> 16:10.435
The struggle between the fox

16:11.171 --> 16:13.115
and the human.

16:13.139 --> 16:15.440
Perhaps this will shift the
power back into your hands.

16:19.412 --> 16:20.478
Are you in pain?

16:21.982 --> 16:23.014
No.

16:23.616 --> 16:24.616
No, I'm fine.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.673
This book.

16:37.697 --> 16:40.476
This is what I keep coming
back to, again and again.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.311
But still no leads? Nothing.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.713
Which makes me wonder
if I've been coming at it

16:43.737 --> 16:45.147
from the wrong direction.

16:45.171 --> 16:46.582
What do you mean?

16:46.606 --> 16:48.184
Well, the whole time
I've been looking at this

16:48.208 --> 16:50.019
and I've been thinking
"science fiction."

16:50.043 --> 16:52.076
But they're not
Dread Scientists.

16:53.279 --> 16:54.991
They're Dread Doctors.

16:55.015 --> 16:57.226
So now you're looking
for a medical connection.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.028
Or medical condition.

16:59.052 --> 17:01.364
Something that Tracy,
Lucas and Donovan

17:01.388 --> 17:03.099
could've all had in common.

17:03.123 --> 17:04.400
You're not asking me to
hand over medical files

17:04.424 --> 17:06.535
without a court order, are you?

17:06.559 --> 17:08.693
I would never ask
you to do that.

17:09.128 --> 17:10.506
Good.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.696
Because they may
take away this key card

17:14.567 --> 17:17.680
which allows me access
to medical records.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.249
Do you want to see
how the key card works?

17:20.272 --> 17:22.073
I would love to see
how the key card works.

17:23.076 --> 17:24.208
Follow me.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.794
We're betting our
lives on these?

17:31.818 --> 17:34.363
I think we're betting
Hayden's life on them.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.867
Yeah, well, I'm glad
I brought my gun.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.319
Is it me

18:30.343 --> 18:32.410
or is Liam not aware of
the second part of the plan?

18:34.280 --> 18:36.480
I'm still not sure if there's
going to be a second part.

18:37.150 --> 18:38.216
Or if it's going to work.

19:06.412 --> 19:08.424
You still wondering why I
haven't said anything to Scott?

19:08.448 --> 19:09.547
Maybe.

19:12.719 --> 19:14.697
You think I've got some
kind of ulterior motive.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.465
More than likely.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.723
Would you believe me
if I said all I want...

19:20.693 --> 19:22.438
All I've ever wanted

19:22.462 --> 19:23.405
is for you guys to trust me?

19:23.429 --> 19:25.341
Nope.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.843
So you're here because
you're never going to trust me.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.300
Yep. Glad we had this talk.

19:35.441 --> 19:36.552
You know who you remind me of?

19:36.576 --> 19:37.808
Theo, I don't care.

19:43.816 --> 19:44.759
My sister.

19:44.783 --> 19:46.103
She was smarter
than everyone too.

19:46.953 --> 19:48.819
And a pain in the ass like you.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.923
But she always
looked out for me.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.794
The same way you
look out for Scott.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.735
You know, I was the
one that found her body.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.340
She'd fallen into a creek,

20:09.742 --> 20:10.775
broken her leg.

20:15.848 --> 20:17.726
They told us she
would've been okay

20:17.750 --> 20:19.750
if it wasn't one of the
coldest nights of the year.

20:20.653 --> 20:22.386
If it wasn't for
the hypothermia.

20:25.425 --> 20:26.425
And when I found her,

20:27.794 --> 20:29.727
all I could think was
that I should've known.

20:33.933 --> 20:35.866
That I should've been
looking out for her.

20:37.804 --> 20:39.748
Why are you telling me this?

20:39.772 --> 20:41.884
I'm telling you because
even if you don't trust me

20:41.908 --> 20:44.486
and even if you don't like me,

20:44.510 --> 20:46.230
I'm still going to be
looking out for you...

20:49.482 --> 20:51.849
the way I should have
been looking out for her.

20:55.255 --> 20:56.255
Theo.

21:17.377 --> 21:19.888
There's a full moon
coming. I know.

21:19.912 --> 21:21.690
I put that up there
when I realized

21:21.714 --> 21:23.381
just how much bigger
the job had gotten.

21:25.985 --> 21:27.718
You don't think
he's still alive, do you?

21:28.521 --> 21:29.632
I wish I could say yes.

21:29.656 --> 21:30.721
You wish?

21:32.492 --> 21:34.332
Isn't this the kid that
threatened to stab you?

21:34.827 --> 21:36.372
Yeah.

21:36.396 --> 21:37.396
But he was just a kid.

21:38.364 --> 21:39.597
More than anything else,

21:41.834 --> 21:43.668
a victim of circumstance.

21:47.340 --> 21:48.506
The day his father was shot,

21:50.076 --> 21:52.076
Donovan jumped on his
motorcycle to get to him.

21:53.713 --> 21:55.680
He was hit by a car two
blocks from the hospital.

21:57.717 --> 21:59.795
So, when his father
was finding out

21:59.819 --> 22:01.864
that a bullet had
severed his spine,

22:01.888 --> 22:04.722
Donovan was being wheeled
into surgery for internal bleeding.

22:05.925 --> 22:06.991
Hold on.

22:08.928 --> 22:10.761
Didn't you say something
about a skin graft?

22:12.098 --> 22:13.631
Yeah, that was Tracy. Uh...

22:16.736 --> 22:18.769
Deaton said that there was
a graft on her shoulder.

22:21.941 --> 22:23.441
Donovan had one too.

22:28.715 --> 22:30.948
Don't worry,
you learn to control it.

22:34.721 --> 22:35.380
I'm not like you.

22:35.404 --> 22:36.764
I wasn't bitten
by a wolf. I was...

22:37.957 --> 22:39.423
somebody's science experiment.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.095
This is so bizarre.

22:45.665 --> 22:46.897
I know,

22:47.900 --> 22:48.900
but you're gonna be okay.

22:50.036 --> 22:51.102
I promise.

22:53.873 --> 22:54.972
What am I?

22:59.712 --> 23:00.878
You're Hayden.

23:06.819 --> 23:08.119
By the way,

23:08.955 --> 23:10.454
if you get me out of this,

23:11.858 --> 23:13.791
I'll forget all about
the sixth grade.

23:55.868 --> 23:57.646
Scott?

23:57.670 --> 23:59.782
I was just thinking since
we can't use our phones,

23:59.806 --> 24:01.884
we can't check in
on Stiles and Theo.

24:01.908 --> 24:05.154
I didn't even think
about that. Me either.

24:05.178 --> 24:07.523
So we're standing here
waiting for guys in masks

24:07.547 --> 24:09.124
and breathing tubes to show up.

24:09.148 --> 24:12.049
But who or what are
Stiles and Theo waiting for?

24:19.625 --> 24:20.691
You know, I saw his teeth.

24:23.129 --> 24:24.228
Donovan.

24:24.864 --> 24:26.542
He was a, uh...

24:26.566 --> 24:27.898
Wendigo, wasn't he?

24:28.534 --> 24:29.945
Yeah.

24:29.969 --> 24:31.669
That's the cannibal one, right?

24:32.972 --> 24:34.450
Native American.

24:34.474 --> 24:36.485
The myth says that
if you ate human flesh,

24:36.509 --> 24:38.120
your punishment was
to turn into a creature

24:38.144 --> 24:39.510
that constantly craved it.

24:42.048 --> 24:43.992
That's a pretty judgmental myth.

24:44.016 --> 24:45.694
Well, I didn't make it up.

24:45.718 --> 24:47.238
What if it was the
only way to survive?

24:48.788 --> 24:50.599
I mean, you ever hear
of the Donner party?

24:50.623 --> 24:52.000
I'm pretty sure they
didn't turn into Wendigos.

24:52.024 --> 24:53.544
Well, they didn't
live in Beacon Hills.

24:54.727 --> 24:55.793
Good point.

24:57.730 --> 25:01.777
So what's the punishment
for killing a Chimera?

25:01.801 --> 25:04.235
You spend five hours in
the car with Theo Raeken.

25:08.207 --> 25:09.773
Like I know what
my punishment is.

25:13.045 --> 25:14.245
I'm gonna lose my best friend.

25:18.217 --> 25:19.583
I'm gonna lose Scott.

25:24.557 --> 25:25.623
Ken!

26:37.930 --> 26:39.207
What were you going
to do with these?

26:39.231 --> 26:40.742
Brought them just in case.

26:40.766 --> 26:42.110
In case of what?

26:42.134 --> 26:43.894
In case we had a chance
to catch one of them.

26:45.705 --> 26:47.182
If we can't make the
school a fortress,

26:47.206 --> 26:48.739
then maybe we can
make it a trap.

26:49.742 --> 26:50.919
They're coming for her,

26:50.943 --> 26:52.223
doesn't that mean
she's the bait?

28:30.242 --> 28:32.376
Parrish? Where's he going?

29:09.915 --> 29:11.460
Sorry, there is nothing.

29:11.484 --> 29:13.261
No skin grafts for Lucas.

29:13.285 --> 29:15.786
It can't be a coincidence.

29:16.222 --> 29:17.354
What else is there?

29:18.524 --> 29:20.135
The only other thing I noticed

29:20.159 --> 29:21.837
that he was born with
congenital glaucoma.

29:21.861 --> 29:23.772
But that's nothing
like a skin graft.

29:23.796 --> 29:25.907
Okay, what do they do
for that? The glaucoma?

29:25.931 --> 29:27.375
Uh, did he take medication?

29:27.399 --> 29:28.910
It says here they did

29:28.934 --> 29:30.378
a corneal transplant
a few years ago.

29:30.402 --> 29:32.082
It's a fairly routine
outpatient procedure.

29:33.506 --> 29:36.518
It was an allogeneic transplant

29:36.542 --> 29:38.442
taken from a recently
deceased donor.

29:43.015 --> 29:44.081
What?

29:45.351 --> 29:47.551
Tracy's skin graft
was allogeneic.

29:48.854 --> 29:50.165
That means taken
from individuals

29:50.189 --> 29:51.555
of the same species.

29:54.193 --> 29:55.193
So was Donovan's.

29:56.362 --> 29:58.173
Both skin grafts and the cornea

29:58.197 --> 29:59.941
were taken from outside donors.

29:59.965 --> 30:02.477
Donovan, Tracy and
Lucas had two sets of DNA.

30:02.501 --> 30:04.079
Chimeras.

30:04.103 --> 30:06.303
Were all genetic
Chimeras to begin with.

30:09.375 --> 30:12.454
Liam, we brought her here
to protect her.

30:12.478 --> 30:13.555
And now she's bait.

30:13.579 --> 30:14.956
Am I?

30:14.980 --> 30:16.958
No. No one's bait.

30:16.982 --> 30:18.927
But we can't be bodyguards
to everyone every night.

30:18.951 --> 30:21.263
Then why aren't we
talking to Stiles' dad?

30:21.287 --> 30:23.565
Why aren't we doing something
better than hiding in a school?

30:23.589 --> 30:25.066
Because we still don't
know anything about them

30:25.090 --> 30:27.169
or what they want, okay?

30:27.193 --> 30:28.570
They're winning

30:28.594 --> 30:30.539
and we don't even know
what the game is.

30:30.563 --> 30:32.541
What if they come in here
and those things don't work?

30:32.565 --> 30:33.875
What if you have
an asthma attack again?

30:33.899 --> 30:34.943
What are we gonna do?

30:34.967 --> 30:36.044
I don't know.

30:36.068 --> 30:37.212
This plan sucks!

30:37.236 --> 30:38.368
You got a better one?

30:39.905 --> 30:41.405
Kids are dying! And she's next.

30:43.142 --> 30:44.452
So, somebody has
to do something.

30:44.476 --> 30:45.954
Somebody has to save everyone.

30:45.978 --> 30:47.258
So somebody's
got to be the bait!

31:04.930 --> 31:05.930
Scott.

31:11.103 --> 31:12.135
Promise me

31:13.472 --> 31:15.539
you'll do everything
you can to save her.

31:17.443 --> 31:18.508
Scott...

31:20.980 --> 31:22.079
Promise.

31:24.583 --> 31:26.049
I'll do everything I can.

31:28.020 --> 31:29.020
I promise.

31:30.422 --> 31:32.567
Guys...

31:32.591 --> 31:34.351
I think I might need
a little help right now.

31:35.094 --> 31:36.972
I forgot my pills.

31:36.996 --> 31:38.473
I have a bottle in my locker.
I can get them, but...

31:38.497 --> 31:39.563
I'll get them.

31:46.305 --> 31:47.504
What's your combination?

31:56.315 --> 31:58.115
Hurry. I'll keep watch.

33:05.017 --> 33:06.017
Kira?

33:10.155 --> 33:11.032
You know who I am.

33:11.056 --> 33:13.368
Kira. Kira, stop.

33:13.392 --> 33:15.225
I am the Messenger of Death.

33:21.133 --> 33:22.133
Scott?

33:40.085 --> 33:41.396
Tracy?

33:41.420 --> 33:43.487
Lydia? Thank God.
I need your help.

33:45.758 --> 33:47.024
What do you need?

33:48.627 --> 33:49.771
What can I do?

33:49.795 --> 33:51.361
I need you to scream.

34:31.670 --> 34:33.782
If Scott really gave up on you

34:33.806 --> 34:35.449
for some piece of
crap like Donovan,

34:35.474 --> 34:36.818
then he wouldn't be
a True Alpha, would he?

34:36.842 --> 34:38.786
Or maybe that's the
definition of one,

34:38.811 --> 34:40.342
someone who doesn't
put up with murder.

34:41.447 --> 34:43.091
It sounds like you
guys need to look up

34:43.114 --> 34:44.692
justifiable homicide.

34:44.716 --> 34:46.393
Did you seriously just
say that to the son of a cop?

34:46.418 --> 34:48.263
A werewolf's eyes are
supposed to change color

34:48.286 --> 34:49.527
when you take an innocent life.

34:51.389 --> 34:52.621
Do these look blue to you?

34:55.427 --> 34:56.726
It was self-defense.

34:58.297 --> 34:59.774
For me and for you.

34:59.798 --> 35:02.243
Or maybe you just don't
feel all that bad about it.

35:02.267 --> 35:04.112
You can't say one
life is objectively

35:04.136 --> 35:05.613
less innocent than another one.

35:05.637 --> 35:07.549
What if they turn blue
'cause you feel guilty?

35:07.573 --> 35:08.650
So it's up to interpretation?

35:08.674 --> 35:09.784
Yeah, maybe.

35:09.808 --> 35:11.319
Okay.

35:11.343 --> 35:12.687
Then here's my interpretation

35:12.711 --> 35:14.191
of what happened
with you and Donovan.

35:15.347 --> 35:16.413
Not guilty.

35:20.586 --> 35:22.119
Did you feel bad about it?

35:23.822 --> 35:25.633
Not now. I mean right then.

35:25.657 --> 35:28.103
Right when it happened.

35:28.127 --> 35:29.571
What were you thinking the
moment you knew he was dead

35:29.595 --> 35:30.827
and there was no saving him?

35:36.902 --> 35:37.902
One word...

35:40.172 --> 35:41.304
Good.

35:56.321 --> 35:57.321
What?

35:58.457 --> 35:59.523
A scent.

36:02.194 --> 36:03.660
Like smoke. Like
something burning.

37:22.341 --> 37:23.341
You okay?

37:27.746 --> 37:28.812
Better than ever.

37:35.721 --> 37:36.820
It healed.

37:37.623 --> 37:38.688
Didn't it?

37:53.605 --> 37:55.972
Hayden, did you hear that?

37:57.576 --> 37:59.587
They're here, aren't they?

37:59.611 --> 38:00.611
They're in the school.

38:06.852 --> 38:08.285
Scott?

38:09.921 --> 38:11.054
Malia?

38:46.558 --> 38:49.693
We are on a frequency
you can't possibly imagine.

39:09.648 --> 39:10.692
The body...

39:10.716 --> 39:11.881
The body's gone.

39:22.394 --> 39:23.971
Sorry. Sorry. I
was trying to help.

39:23.995 --> 39:25.440
Liam said pain...

39:25.464 --> 39:26.544
He said it makes you human.

39:27.099 --> 39:28.676
What happened?

39:28.700 --> 39:29.866
What are you doing here?

39:31.670 --> 39:32.613
I found another Chimera.

39:32.637 --> 39:33.770
His name's Corey.

39:34.473 --> 39:35.538
Wait.

39:36.141 --> 39:37.540
Where's Liam and Hayden?

39:40.412 --> 39:41.622
They're gone.

39:41.646 --> 39:43.413
Hayden and Liam are gone.

40:11.877 --> 40:13.076
Hayden.

40:31.730 --> 40:33.741
No, no, no. Don't...

40:33.765 --> 40:34.765
Don't hurt her!

40:40.205 --> 40:41.438
Hayden!

40:46.445 --> 40:47.445
Hayden!

40:50.015 --> 40:52.849
Hayden. Hayden.

40:54.553 --> 40:55.553
Hayden.
