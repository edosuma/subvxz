00:08.138 --> 00:10.862
Death and destruction in
the streets of Los Angeles today

00:10.864 --> 00:14.026
as the recovery from the
San Andreas quake is ongoing.

00:14.028 --> 00:15.158
The long dreaded "Big One",

00:15.160 --> 00:16.363
which broke
the Richter scale,

00:16.364 --> 00:19.282
registering at a
record-breaking 12.7,

00:19.284 --> 00:21.285
destroyed countless lives
as the military

00:21.287 --> 00:22.288
continues it's cleanup.

01:23.671 --> 01:25.798
[laughs]

01:27.963 --> 01:30.146
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:30.148 --> 01:31.065
Oh.

01:32.482 --> 01:34.108
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

01:34.110 --> 01:36.485
Did you get a hold of
your daughter?

01:36.487 --> 01:38.486
Yeah, yeah.

01:38.488 --> 01:41.616
She's just been deployed
to Los Angeles

01:41.618 --> 01:43.825
assisting with the evacuations.

01:43.827 --> 01:47.454
She is a natural-born
survivor and fighter.

01:47.456 --> 01:48.789
I'm sure you must
be very proud.

01:48.791 --> 01:51.000
Yeah, yeah, I'm proud.

01:51.002 --> 01:56.046
I just wish she'd chosen a
less hazardous career path.

01:56.048 --> 01:58.673
The Army is lucky to have her.

01:58.675 --> 02:00.301
Yeah, they are.

02:00.303 --> 02:02.929
It's just that right now
Los Angeles is in ruins.

02:02.931 --> 02:05.932
She's right in the middle
of all the danger.

02:05.934 --> 02:08.015
Oh, I have it on
pretty good authority

02:08.018 --> 02:11.479
that her dad used
to really love danger.

02:11.481 --> 02:14.148
I mean, back in the day.

02:14.150 --> 02:17.400
Oh, that was
a long time ago.

02:17.402 --> 02:19.445
Yeah. The apple doesn't
fall far from the tree.

02:19.447 --> 02:21.488
I suppose.

02:21.490 --> 02:24.408
Doesn't mean I have
to like it, though.

02:24.410 --> 02:27.744
But, no, really, I'm just
glad right now that Los Angeles

02:27.746 --> 02:31.082
is finally starting
the cleanup process.

02:31.084 --> 02:32.335
The place has been in ruins.

02:38.091 --> 02:39.422
Shall we?

02:39.424 --> 02:42.385
We got a lot of data to analyze
back at the office.

02:42.387 --> 02:43.469
Hey, Werner?

02:43.471 --> 02:48.933
Yeah?

02:48.935 --> 02:51.101
Um, something
that I was hoping...

02:51.103 --> 02:52.604
[rumbling]

03:00.488 --> 03:02.282
Ah!

03:05.450 --> 03:08.037
Come on, Christine!
Let's get back to the center!

03:36.482 --> 03:38.732
Could it just be
an aftershock, Dr. Werner?

03:38.734 --> 03:40.525
I don't think these
are aftershocks, Drew.

03:40.527 --> 03:41.903
Berkeley's too far north.

03:41.905 --> 03:43.529
You think these
could be foreshocks?

03:43.531 --> 03:44.905
You know, L.A.
just had the big one.

03:44.907 --> 03:46.197
The San Andreas
shouldn't be releasing

03:46.199 --> 03:48.034
this much energy
so quickly afterward.

03:48.036 --> 03:52.120
Let's see if we can
figure out what's going on.

03:52.122 --> 03:54.332
It's like massive energy
from the quake

03:54.334 --> 03:56.208
has lengthened the fault
even further.

03:56.210 --> 03:59.837
It nearly stretches the entire
length of California now.

03:59.839 --> 04:01.714
Another earthquake
near San Jose!

04:01.716 --> 04:03.423
[alarm sounds]

04:03.425 --> 04:05.593
- What's that?
- It's a warning.

04:05.595 --> 04:07.803
The seismic waves are
just under the surface.

04:07.805 --> 04:09.596
They're the shallowest
I've ever seen.

04:09.598 --> 04:13.142
S waves that shallow, it
could affect the entire state.

04:13.144 --> 04:14.976
We need to find an epicenter.

04:14.978 --> 04:16.519
See if there's a correlation

04:16.522 --> 04:18.146
between the depth
and the radio output.

04:18.148 --> 04:19.773
When we got hit
here in Berkeley,

04:19.774 --> 04:21.858
I began triangulating
the information.

04:21.861 --> 04:23.401
It turns out that
all these earthquakes

04:23.403 --> 04:24.612
are immensely shallow.

04:24.614 --> 04:26.030
And they're striking up
and down the fault

04:26.032 --> 04:28.573
at a rate I've never
seen before.

04:28.575 --> 04:30.992
Shallow earthquakes up
and down the fault line,

04:30.994 --> 04:33.537
that's gonna be enormous
destructive capability.

04:33.539 --> 04:34.830
Even relatively small quakes

04:34.832 --> 04:36.706
will have catastrophic
consequences.

04:36.708 --> 04:40.169
And at this rate, that fault
line is deteriorating rapidly.

04:40.171 --> 04:43.088
Now everything east of the fault
line should be relatively safe.

04:43.090 --> 04:45.215
I mean, the ground is
gonna absorb most of the energy.

04:45.217 --> 04:46.968
And the west?

04:46.970 --> 04:49.220
Everything west of the fault

04:49.222 --> 04:50.595
will fall into
the Pacific Ocean.

04:50.597 --> 04:52.348
That's right.

04:52.350 --> 04:53.682
And with the intensity
of these quakes,

04:53.684 --> 04:54.975
it's only a matter of time.

04:54.977 --> 04:57.770
Drew, alert the authorities.

04:57.772 --> 05:00.730
Have them start evacuating
everyone east of the fault line.

05:00.732 --> 05:04.318
On it!

05:04.320 --> 05:08.239
You know what
we need to do, right?

05:08.241 --> 05:09.657
Wrong.

05:09.659 --> 05:12.201
We don't need her.

05:12.203 --> 05:13.410
No.

05:13.412 --> 05:16.247
No, I... we can figure
this out on our own.

05:16.249 --> 05:18.040
Look, I know that you guys
are divorced

05:18.042 --> 05:19.917
and she left you
and that wasn't cool.

05:19.919 --> 05:21.294
But she's the only person

05:21.296 --> 05:23.336
who truly knows the device
inside and out.

05:23.338 --> 05:24.713
That's what we need
to shut this down

05:24.715 --> 05:28.759
before it destroys California.

05:28.761 --> 05:31.306
After all, it's what you
guys built it for, isn't it?

05:33.765 --> 05:37.018
Call her, Werner.
Now.

05:37.020 --> 05:40.231
I will make her
travel arrangements.

06:01.669 --> 06:03.796
[cell phone rings]

06:06.465 --> 06:07.297
Hello?

06:07.299 --> 06:09.258
Hello, Deborah. It's...

06:09.260 --> 06:11.677
Jan, hi. Is everything okay?

06:11.679 --> 06:13.261
Yes, yes, and you?

06:13.263 --> 06:15.388
I'm fine.
Have you heard from Ingrid?

06:15.390 --> 06:18.725
Uh, no,
but I keep checking my phone.

06:18.727 --> 06:21.478
I'm worried. She should be
out of there by now.

06:21.480 --> 06:24.148
Yeah. Look, I promise
I'll let you know

06:24.150 --> 06:25.398
as soon as I hear anything.

06:25.400 --> 06:27.150
Deborah, listen.

06:27.152 --> 06:28.944
We're getting a bunch of
shallow quakes at a rapid rate

06:28.946 --> 06:31.071
all up and down
the San Andreas fault line.

06:31.073 --> 06:33.323
How shallow are the depths?

06:33.325 --> 06:35.367
Some of the most shallow
I've ever seen.

06:35.369 --> 06:37.160
Deb...

06:37.162 --> 06:38.871
What do you need from me?

06:38.873 --> 06:41.331
You're gonna hate
hearing this,

06:41.333 --> 06:43.917
but we need your help
with the seismic cannon.

06:43.919 --> 06:46.963
Now if we can triangulate
a median center

06:46.965 --> 06:49.506
of all the earthquakes,
then the waves from your cannon

06:49.508 --> 06:52.093
might be able
to stop this thing.

06:52.095 --> 06:53.718
Look, Jan, I'm sorry,
but you're the one

06:53.720 --> 06:56.179
that allowed the Department
of Defense to weaponize it.

06:56.181 --> 06:58.723
I cannot be responsible
if something goes wrong

06:58.725 --> 07:01.102
with its implementation. No.

07:01.104 --> 07:03.228
If we don't do something,
these earthquakes

07:03.230 --> 07:05.898
are gonna get bigger
and bigger until

07:05.900 --> 07:09.025
the second Big One hits,
a mega quake.

07:09.027 --> 07:11.737
That's correct.

07:11.739 --> 07:14.075
Just give me a minute.

07:17.787 --> 07:19.160
Look, Deborah.

07:19.162 --> 07:21.455
I want you to know I swear
I had no idea

07:21.457 --> 07:23.415
what they were gonna
do to your device.

07:23.417 --> 07:26.335
But right now, we have a
unique opportunity

07:26.337 --> 07:29.754
to mitigate the effects
of this earthquake.

07:29.756 --> 07:32.799
With your help, Deb,
we can restore your cannon

07:32.801 --> 07:34.427
to be used the way you intended,

07:34.429 --> 07:37.847
saving lives and preventing
the catastrophic destruction

07:37.849 --> 07:39.517
of an entire state.

07:41.852 --> 07:43.727
Please, Deb.

07:43.729 --> 07:45.812
California needs you.

07:45.814 --> 07:46.940
Ingrid needs you.

07:49.777 --> 07:52.153
I need you.

07:52.155 --> 07:54.864
Can you even get me to
California with enough time?

07:54.866 --> 07:56.239
Yes.

07:56.241 --> 07:58.367
My people are securing
a flight to Reno right now.

07:58.369 --> 08:00.953
From there, you get on one of
our private helicopters to here.

08:00.955 --> 08:04.334
If you're in, I can have you
here in just about three hours.

08:08.421 --> 08:12.172
Okay, Jan, I'll do it.
I'll do it.

08:12.174 --> 08:14.174
Enable your location
on your mobile phone

08:14.176 --> 08:16.054
and I'll forward it to
the proper channels.

08:18.097 --> 08:20.848
I knew the government
would track my phone.

08:20.850 --> 08:24.184
Hey, just be glad I don't have
access to your search history.

08:24.186 --> 08:26.896
See you soon... and, Deb?

08:26.898 --> 08:29.439
Yeah?

08:29.441 --> 08:31.107
Thank you.

08:31.109 --> 08:33.488
Yeah. I'm glad I can help.

08:47.085 --> 08:50.252
I reached out
to Dr. Franklin.

08:50.254 --> 08:52.003
She'll be
on her way here shortly.

08:52.005 --> 08:53.923
Should I contact
the Department of Defense?

08:53.925 --> 08:57.050
Yeah. We need to loop them
in immediately.

08:57.052 --> 08:57.970
On it.

08:59.430 --> 09:01.097
You really think they're
gonna let you tear open

09:01.099 --> 09:03.140
their new weapon and
completely rewire it?

09:03.142 --> 09:05.101
They have to.

09:05.103 --> 09:07.019
So many lives at stake.

09:07.021 --> 09:08.312
And right now,
that device is the only thing

09:08.314 --> 09:10.439
that'll stop the quakes.

09:10.441 --> 09:12.232
Without it,
all of Western California

09:12.234 --> 09:14.694
will slip into the ocean.

09:14.696 --> 09:17.988
Besides, it was our design
in the first place.

09:17.990 --> 09:19.324
I hope they listen.

09:29.918 --> 09:31.794
Deborah Franklin?

09:31.796 --> 09:32.795
Yeah!

09:32.797 --> 09:34.045
Pilot Bill Roberts.

09:34.047 --> 09:36.466
Welcome aboard.
Follow me.

09:59.907 --> 10:02.116
Let's strap on our belts.

10:02.118 --> 10:04.285
This looks like
a military aircraft.

10:04.287 --> 10:05.535
Are you in the service?

10:05.537 --> 10:07.704
Retired Army.

10:07.706 --> 10:10.292
What's this?
Like the emergency brake?

10:11.753 --> 10:12.959
No.

10:12.961 --> 10:15.672
Don't worry.
You're in great hands.

10:22.095 --> 10:23.511
Jan?

10:23.513 --> 10:25.014
You're gonna want to see this.

10:25.016 --> 10:26.267
Put it up.

10:28.143 --> 10:34.607
[rumbling]

10:34.609 --> 10:35.526
Jan?

10:36.945 --> 10:37.946
Is this it?

10:39.154 --> 10:40.987
Are we too late?

10:40.989 --> 10:43.366
No, they're just foreshocks,
but they're everywhere!

10:43.368 --> 10:46.579
And they're progressively
getting bigger!

10:56.797 --> 11:00.341
At this rate, we have
less than 12 hours

11:00.343 --> 11:02.011
before a mega quake.

11:08.017 --> 11:09.310
Deb...

11:20.821 --> 11:22.322
[rumbling]

11:25.200 --> 11:26.659
Come in, Mission Control!

11:26.661 --> 11:28.868
We've had reports of
seismic activity coming in

11:28.870 --> 11:32.080
and out of your
designated landing zone.

11:32.082 --> 11:33.165
Proceed with caution.

11:33.167 --> 11:35.753
10-4!
Over and out!

11:48.099 --> 11:49.142
Ah!

11:50.976 --> 11:53.854
We're gonna hit the ground!
Hold on to something!

12:06.283 --> 12:08.074
Everyone okay?

12:08.076 --> 12:09.200
You okay?

12:09.202 --> 12:11.204
You good, Drew?

went down on Mount Eagle.

12:22.133 --> 12:23.216
What?

12:25.720 --> 12:27.844
Try to find the median center
of all these earthquakes, okay?

12:27.846 --> 12:30.723
That's gonna give us the best
location to stop this thing!

12:30.725 --> 12:31.808
Excuse me.

Yeah, Dad, it's me.

13:23.610 --> 13:26.695
What... where are you?
Did you evacuate?

13:26.697 --> 13:30.323
Uh, no, no.
I'm still in Los Angeles.

13:30.325 --> 13:33.828
- Are you safe?
- Yeah.

13:33.830 --> 13:36.079
Well, how are you able to call
me if you're still on duty?

13:36.081 --> 13:40.626
Uh, the mission went
completely FUBAR, Dad.

13:40.628 --> 13:42.169
I'm the only one left.

13:42.171 --> 13:44.838
Found the last live line here.

13:44.840 --> 13:48.925
I tried to call my CO,
but they're not answering.

13:48.927 --> 13:50.345
I think they moved out
without me.

13:52.931 --> 13:57.226
Dad, I wanted to give you
a call one last time in case...

13:57.228 --> 13:59.770
No, no, no.
Don't say that, honey.

13:59.772 --> 14:01.354
Look, you need to get
as far away from Los Angeles

14:01.356 --> 14:04.275
as possible, okay?
It's not safe.

14:04.277 --> 14:05.734
ASAP, baby, okay?

14:05.736 --> 14:07.152
If you move out now,
you might be able to meet up

14:07.154 --> 14:10.530
with some other
military personnel.

14:10.532 --> 14:14.160
Yeah.
Yeah, you're probably right.

14:14.162 --> 14:16.411
Help! Help!

14:16.413 --> 14:17.954
Is there someone
with you, honey?

14:17.956 --> 14:22.001
Dad, I have to go.
People here need me.

14:22.003 --> 14:24.337
No, Ingrid. You need to
get out of there right now!

14:24.339 --> 14:28.924
Dad, I came here on a mission
to get people to safety.

14:28.926 --> 14:30.175
And that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

14:30.177 --> 14:31.551
I have to go!

14:31.553 --> 14:34.137
All right.
Just, uh...

14:34.139 --> 14:35.973
Just be safe, okay?

14:35.975 --> 14:38.976
This thing's gonna get a lost
worse before it gets better.

14:38.978 --> 14:42.063
I want you get out of there and
head east as soon as you can.

14:42.065 --> 14:43.481
Okay.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.942
Okay, I'll call you
as soon as I'm safe.

14:45.944 --> 14:47.568
Great.

14:47.570 --> 14:50.112
I love you, Dad.

14:50.114 --> 14:52.075
I love you too, honey.

15:11.719 --> 15:12.762
Deb?

15:14.221 --> 15:15.681
Deb?

15:38.454 --> 15:39.870
Werner?

15:39.872 --> 15:41.414
Deb!

15:41.416 --> 15:43.498
Oh, thank God!
Are you okay?

15:43.500 --> 15:46.711
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

15:46.713 --> 15:50.298
I don't know where my pilot is.
I think he may be dead.

15:50.300 --> 15:51.631
Where are you?

15:51.633 --> 15:56.219
Uh, we crashed northeast
of the landing site.

15:56.221 --> 15:57.514
Northeast.

16:02.186 --> 16:03.352
Okay, I think I see you.

16:03.354 --> 16:05.023
Hold on.
I'm on my way.

16:22.916 --> 16:24.334
[moaning]

16:26.002 --> 16:27.712
Oh, my God.

16:30.130 --> 16:31.505
Stay calm.

16:31.507 --> 16:34.467
Forget it.
It's too heavy.

16:34.469 --> 16:38.386
Save yourself.

16:38.388 --> 16:39.722
Ma'am?

16:39.724 --> 16:43.309
I've flown emergency
choppers for decades.

16:43.311 --> 16:48.271
I've seen this exact
same wound several times.

16:48.273 --> 16:51.525
I'm just gonna lay here
and enjoy this view

16:51.527 --> 16:55.529
while I can before
they get you out of here.

16:55.531 --> 16:57.073
Before they us out of here!

16:57.075 --> 16:59.869
You're not gonna let one
bumpy landing take you down!

17:02.162 --> 17:03.536
Thank you.

17:03.538 --> 17:06.415
I wish I could share your
confidence right about now.

17:06.416 --> 17:07.709
[moaning]

17:12.089 --> 17:13.838
Hey.

17:13.839 --> 17:17.467
Make sure you guys finish
what you guys came here to do.

17:17.469 --> 17:19.221
Okay.

17:21.515 --> 17:26.519
[moaning]

17:26.521 --> 17:28.354
- Deb!
- Oh my God!

17:28.356 --> 17:29.605
You okay?

17:29.607 --> 17:32.441
I'm shook up,
but I'm okay, I'm okay.

17:32.443 --> 17:35.278
Oh my God, baby.

17:35.280 --> 17:36.570
We gotta go.

17:36.572 --> 17:37.905
We gotta go now before
the roads get worse.

17:37.907 --> 17:39.322
No, no, no.
We can't leave...

17:39.324 --> 17:40.741
No, no, no. We got an
emergency team en route.

17:40.743 --> 17:41.951
- We can't leave him.
- This your bag?

17:41.953 --> 17:43.493
- Yeah.
- Yeah? We gotta go!

17:43.495 --> 17:45.497
- Come on!
- Let me get my computer.

17:46.791 --> 17:48.540
What happened to your leg?

17:48.542 --> 17:50.294
Bike accident. I'll tell
you about it en route.

17:51.462 --> 17:52.839
Let's go!

17:58.636 --> 18:02.597
Oh, God, he just...

18:02.599 --> 18:03.725
Deb, I'm so sorry.

18:07.020 --> 18:10.562
Nothing you could have
done about it, okay?

18:10.564 --> 18:12.565
He knew the risks of
that job when he took it.

18:12.567 --> 18:15.401
No one could have
predicted this, Werner!

18:15.403 --> 18:17.235
We sent that man to his death!

18:17.237 --> 18:19.030
A lot more people are gonna
die if we don't get you

18:19.032 --> 18:21.072
safely back to
the headquarters and find a way

18:21.074 --> 18:22.450
to stop these quakes
from happening.

18:22.452 --> 18:24.201
He just...

18:24.203 --> 18:28.789
He would have wanted you to
get back and stop that same fate

18:28.791 --> 18:31.250
from happening
to countless others.

18:31.252 --> 18:33.087
That way, his life wouldn't
have been in vain.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.464
- Okay.
- Okay?

18:37.466 --> 18:40.467
You're right.

18:40.469 --> 18:42.427
[sighs]

18:42.429 --> 18:44.972
Did you bring your laptop?

18:44.974 --> 18:46.184
Yeah.

18:57.028 --> 18:58.569
You okay?

18:58.571 --> 19:01.198
Well, it's been one hell of
a morning, I'll tell you that.

19:04.452 --> 19:05.742
- Here.
- What?

19:05.744 --> 19:07.369
You're bleeding.

19:07.371 --> 19:09.122
- Oh, my nose.
- Yeah.

19:14.878 --> 19:16.462
- Did I get it?
- On your lip.

19:16.464 --> 19:18.547
- On my lip?
- Yeah.

19:18.549 --> 19:20.465
Good?

19:20.467 --> 19:23.176
It's dripping on your lip.

19:23.178 --> 19:24.971
- There you go.
- Thanks.

19:24.973 --> 19:28.142
Here. Check out what
we've been dealing with.

19:37.569 --> 19:40.278
Oh, wow. Oh, wow!

19:40.280 --> 19:41.736
Okay, I see what you're
talking about here.

19:41.738 --> 19:44.781
This is a massive
expansion on the rift!

19:44.783 --> 19:46.325
Were we right?

19:46.327 --> 19:48.118
Do these earthquakes
have the potential

19:48.120 --> 19:50.831
to knock everything west of
the fault line into the ocean?

19:53.876 --> 19:56.711
Deborah, is it as bad
as I think it is?

19:56.713 --> 19:58.628
Yeah. In fact...

19:58.630 --> 20:05.886
Look, I don't know if the cannon
is gonna be enough to stop this.

20:05.888 --> 20:07.055
I told you it was bad.

20:11.224 --> 20:12.102
Hold on!

20:14.480 --> 20:16.524
[tires squealing]

20:34.751 --> 20:36.793
[horns honking]

20:52.726 --> 20:54.851
You okay?

20:54.853 --> 20:58.146
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm okay, okay.

20:58.148 --> 21:03.360
Okay, if what I'm looking at is
right, and I believe it to be,

21:03.362 --> 21:06.155
the entire California coast
is gonna break off

21:06.157 --> 21:08.616
into the ocean in
a matter of hours.

21:08.618 --> 21:11.452
This is the data.

21:11.454 --> 21:14.579
My colleague
said the same thing.

21:14.581 --> 21:18.253
I was hoping he's wrong,
but I guess not.

21:19.712 --> 21:21.381
[rumbling]

21:25.260 --> 21:28.596
Reverse!
Go, go, go, go, go!

21:48.241 --> 21:50.618
[moaning]

21:59.127 --> 22:02.712
Deb?

22:02.714 --> 22:04.004
Deb, you okay?

22:04.006 --> 22:06.799
For someone who's been
in a helicopter crash

22:06.801 --> 22:09.635
and a car crash, surprisingly.

22:09.637 --> 22:12.639
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.
Is the truck okay?

22:19.688 --> 22:21.440
It looks all right.

22:24.569 --> 22:26.111
Here goes nothing.

22:28.071 --> 22:29.571
[engine starts]

22:29.573 --> 22:31.199
Oh, thank God.

22:34.954 --> 22:36.787
Have you heard from her yet?

22:36.789 --> 22:37.996
Yeah.

22:37.998 --> 22:39.874
Yeah, I heard from her
just a little while ago.

22:39.876 --> 22:43.251
- She's okay.
- Okay.

22:43.253 --> 22:45.879
I can't believe
she's still in L.A.

22:45.881 --> 22:47.423
Yeah.

22:47.425 --> 22:49.508
She's doing what
the Army tells her to do.

22:49.510 --> 22:52.094
You know, I think she
really likes the structure,

22:52.096 --> 22:54.597
seeing that she didn't
have much of it at home.

22:54.599 --> 22:56.141
[chuckles]

22:56.975 --> 22:58.143
Good one.

23:15.703 --> 23:17.247
Hello?

23:19.165 --> 23:20.457
Hello?

23:22.126 --> 23:24.837
Hello? Is anybody here?

23:28.507 --> 23:31.299
Hello?

23:31.301 --> 23:34.886
Hello? Can you hear me?
Is there anybody here?

23:34.888 --> 23:35.930
Hello?

23:35.932 --> 23:37.517
[rumbling]

23:40.436 --> 23:41.478
Hello?

23:42.855 --> 23:45.356
Hello? Can you hear me?

23:45.358 --> 23:46.691
Yes.

23:46.693 --> 23:48.651
Yes, I'm with the
United States Army, miss.

23:48.653 --> 23:49.777
Do you need help?

23:49.779 --> 23:51.736
Yes. I'm trapped on
the third floor.

23:51.738 --> 23:54.949
The door to my office
is blocked.

23:54.951 --> 23:56.826
All right.
What's your name?

23:56.828 --> 24:00.078
- Sadie.
- Sadie.

24:00.080 --> 24:02.498
I'm gonna find a way
to get you out, all right?

24:02.500 --> 24:07.502
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you so much!

24:07.504 --> 24:08.755
Of course.

24:12.968 --> 24:14.050
All right, don't worry, miss.

24:14.052 --> 24:15.552
I'm gonna find a way up to you.

24:15.554 --> 24:17.514
And we're gonna get you out,
all right?

24:23.980 --> 24:25.396
Jan, everything okay?

24:25.398 --> 24:27.774
Yes, yes.

24:31.654 --> 24:32.778
Drew? Christine?

24:32.780 --> 24:35.572
This is Dr. Deborah Franklin,
expert seismologist.

24:35.574 --> 24:36.949
And volcanologist,
but hopefully

24:36.951 --> 24:38.075
it doesn't come to that.

24:38.077 --> 24:40.368
Let's hope not.

24:40.370 --> 24:43.623
Hi, I'm Christine.
Nice to meet you.

24:43.625 --> 24:45.875
Same.

24:45.877 --> 24:48.376
Welcome, Dr. Franklin.
We've heard a lot about you.

24:48.378 --> 24:51.172
- Hopefully, all good things.
- Yes, ma'am.

24:51.174 --> 24:52.964
Have the foreshocks
gotten any stronger?

24:52.966 --> 24:54.174
We felt a couple
on the way over.

24:54.176 --> 24:56.551
They're up 5.5.

24:56.553 --> 24:57.970
Still growing,
but at a steady rate.

24:57.972 --> 25:01.264
Great. Drew?
Any updates?

25:01.266 --> 25:03.392
D.O.D. needs to know
where we want the cannon.

25:03.394 --> 25:05.603
Okay. Did we find the
center of the quakes yet?

25:05.605 --> 25:07.021
We're still trying to
find the exact coordinates.

25:07.023 --> 25:08.647
The waves are so strong
and moving so fast,

25:08.649 --> 25:10.191
it's proving to be
extremely difficult

25:10.193 --> 25:11.819
to find an exact median.

25:16.616 --> 25:19.116
Any way we can get that thing
to triangulate faster?

25:19.118 --> 25:21.034
We need to get
the cannon loaded ASAP.

25:21.036 --> 25:22.828
Every second we waste,
California gets closer

25:22.830 --> 25:24.204
to utter destruction.

25:24.206 --> 25:25.956
With the intensity of
these foreshocks

25:25.958 --> 25:28.792
and the speed of the wave,
I'd say we'd be lucky

25:28.794 --> 25:30.461
if the computer can find
any pattern at all.

25:30.463 --> 25:32.215
I think I can help
you with that.

25:33.882 --> 25:35.050
Take a look.

25:36.677 --> 25:37.885
Wait. What did you do?

25:37.887 --> 25:40.346
So using the software you
gave me and the algorithm

25:40.348 --> 25:43.057
I developed to track the flow of
magma beneath the earth's crust,

25:43.059 --> 25:44.809
we should be able to use
the disturbances

25:44.811 --> 25:47.060
of the natural slower
flowing magma

25:47.062 --> 25:49.855
rather than the unpredictable
fast-moving S waves.

25:49.857 --> 25:52.441
Impressive.

25:52.443 --> 25:54.277
How long will
this take to install?

25:54.279 --> 25:56.945
Not long.
It is good to go.

25:56.947 --> 25:58.198
Plug it in.

26:03.663 --> 26:06.038
How on earth did you
let that woman go?

26:06.040 --> 26:08.456
Let's just focus on saving
California right now.

26:08.458 --> 26:11.085
Wait. What happened to the map?

26:11.087 --> 26:12.422
Damn it!

26:28.562 --> 26:29.898
Hello?

26:31.189 --> 26:33.732
- Sadie?
- Hello?

26:33.734 --> 26:35.360
[rumbling]

26:40.949 --> 26:42.491
I don't know what happened.

26:42.493 --> 26:44.076
It merged seamlessly
on my computer!

26:44.078 --> 26:45.619
Every minute we waste
trying to fix it is a minute

26:45.621 --> 26:47.329
that we don't have
finding the center!

26:47.331 --> 26:49.790
Everything west of the
San Andreas fault is at risk!

26:49.792 --> 26:51.416
Hey, yelling at her
is not gonna make her

26:51.418 --> 26:54.127
work any faster, Jan.

26:54.129 --> 26:56.338
Sorry, Deborah.

26:56.340 --> 26:57.673
All right, and I got it.

26:57.675 --> 26:59.174
We're set.
We just need to reboot.

26:59.176 --> 27:01.092
Thank God!

27:01.094 --> 27:02.802
How long is this gonna take?

27:02.804 --> 27:04.974
Just a couple of minutes
and we are good.

27:06.016 --> 27:07.267
[rumbling]

27:25.494 --> 27:27.078
Oh, my God, the computer!

27:27.080 --> 27:28.790
If we lose it,
we'll never find the center!

27:34.963 --> 27:36.462
- Drew! Drew!
- Drew!

27:36.464 --> 27:37.756
Drew!

27:51.521 --> 27:54.105
Oh, God!

27:54.107 --> 27:55.940
Drew!

27:55.942 --> 27:57.983
Drew! Drew!

27:57.985 --> 28:00.194
- Hey.
- Oh, thank God, he's okay.

28:00.196 --> 28:01.279
You okay?

28:01.281 --> 28:02.696
Buddy, come on.
You okay?

28:02.698 --> 28:06.951
All right, let's get him up.

28:06.953 --> 28:08.580
- I'm good, I'm good.
- You all right?

28:09.830 --> 28:12.790
You all right?
Whoa! No, you're not.

28:12.792 --> 28:14.709
Christine, get him to
the break room, okay?

28:14.711 --> 28:17.168
Get you off your feet, buddy.
Take a break.

28:17.170 --> 28:19.088
We're gonna need you.

28:19.090 --> 28:20.257
Watch your step.

28:23.594 --> 28:27.178
Oh, great.
We lost the monitor.

28:27.180 --> 28:28.806
All right, we need
to find the center

28:28.808 --> 28:30.599
and then alert the D.O.D.
into play immediately.

28:30.601 --> 28:32.309
Are you sure this cannon
of yours is gonna work?

28:32.311 --> 28:33.769
I mean, is it gonna stop
these quakes

28:33.771 --> 28:35.229
before they become
a mega quake?

28:35.231 --> 28:39.232
I designed it.
I will work.

28:39.234 --> 28:42.986
You gonna play nice with
the D.O.D. when they arrive?

28:42.988 --> 28:45.071
As long as they don't
get in my way,

28:45.073 --> 28:46.490
I will be perfectly
civil to them.

28:46.492 --> 28:49.117
That's not saying a lot.

28:49.119 --> 28:51.453
Hey, they were the ones
that took a life-saving device

28:51.455 --> 28:54.080
and turned it into
a war machine!

28:54.082 --> 28:55.625
Deb, they haven't used it
on anyone yet, okay?

28:55.627 --> 28:58.543
- I've made sure of that.
- Not yet.

28:58.545 --> 29:01.047
Deb, I know how
you feel, okay?

29:01.049 --> 29:02.380
You know how I feel?

29:02.382 --> 29:04.508
To create something that
could potentially save lives

29:04.510 --> 29:06.260
and they turn it into something

29:06.262 --> 29:07.345
that can destroy
entire countries?

29:07.347 --> 29:08.803
You know how I feel?

29:08.805 --> 29:10.181
That's a decision I made,
all right?

29:10.183 --> 29:11.514
They offered us
more money to help fix

29:11.516 --> 29:13.099
and make your machine work.

29:13.101 --> 29:16.186
Well, you were stupid to think
that they would use it for good.

29:16.188 --> 29:18.647
- Stupid!
- Yeah. And you know what?

29:18.649 --> 29:19.898
That's a decision that
I've had to live with

29:19.900 --> 29:21.024
every day of my life!

29:21.026 --> 29:25.279
I don't blame
you for leaving me.

29:25.281 --> 29:26.905
Then why don't you
tell that to Ingrid?

29:26.907 --> 29:31.368
You made your
decision and I made mine,

29:31.370 --> 29:33.453
and she'll see that.

29:33.455 --> 29:35.873
If we even survive.

29:35.875 --> 29:40.252
Deb... the D.O.D.
is with us on this, okay?

29:40.254 --> 29:46.174
They want to save lives
just as much as we do, okay?

29:46.176 --> 29:47.094
Okay.

29:51.139 --> 29:52.848
The D.O.D. is en route.

29:52.850 --> 29:55.268
Most of California is
evacuating as we speak.

29:55.270 --> 29:57.228
What are you doing
back on your feet?

29:57.230 --> 29:58.812
You are so lucky to be okay.

29:58.814 --> 30:00.522
You could have been
seriously hurt.

30:00.524 --> 30:02.482
It'll take more than
that to stop me, ma'am.

30:02.484 --> 30:05.696
California's my home.
We gotta save it.

30:08.116 --> 30:10.199
Take it easy, Drew.

30:10.201 --> 30:11.367
What you did was a stupid

30:11.369 --> 30:13.618
albeit very heroic thing
you did back there.

30:13.620 --> 30:17.205
It was either me
or California.

30:17.207 --> 30:21.503
All right, let's find
the center and save California.

30:27.968 --> 30:31.177
Are you still alive?

30:31.179 --> 30:32.847
Yes.

30:32.849 --> 30:34.639
Okay.

30:34.641 --> 30:36.349
I heard a crash below.

30:36.351 --> 30:37.978
I thought that was
the end of you.

30:42.274 --> 30:43.191
No.

30:46.571 --> 30:47.906
No.

30:50.324 --> 30:53.952
I came here to get you out.

30:55.495 --> 31:01.584
That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

31:01.586 --> 31:06.379
Can you describe
what you see around you?

31:06.381 --> 31:09.674
I guess I'm pretty close
to the middle of the hall.

31:09.676 --> 31:12.304
The door is blocked,
so I can't really go anywhere.

31:15.058 --> 31:17.977
Let me see what it
looks like on my end.

31:25.359 --> 31:27.027
We calculated
the quake's center.

31:29.906 --> 31:33.281
36.8 degrees north,
121.4 degrees west.

31:33.283 --> 31:35.408
Hollister, California...
well, just outside it.

31:35.410 --> 31:36.743
- Great.
- Okay.

31:36.745 --> 31:38.412
We think we finally
calculated how many hours

31:38.414 --> 31:40.080
- till the mega quake hits.
- So how long do we have?

31:40.082 --> 31:42.582
- Approximately six hours.
- That's no time at all.

31:42.584 --> 31:44.210
Then we need to get moving.
Call the D.O.D.

31:44.212 --> 31:46.002
Let 'em know we need
that cannon in Hollister.

31:46.004 --> 31:47.254
I'm on it.

31:47.256 --> 31:48.673
Do you really think
the cannon will work?

31:48.675 --> 31:50.465
Yeah. So my invention
takes seismic waves

31:50.467 --> 31:52.092
produced by an earthquake

31:52.094 --> 31:54.052
and matches their intensity
with an opposing wave.

31:54.054 --> 31:58.390
- Newton's Third Law?
- Precisely.

31:58.392 --> 32:00.600
How does it calculate
the intensity of the waves

32:00.602 --> 32:03.311
- it needs to generate?
- That's a great question.

32:03.313 --> 32:05.815
So the reason we want
to go to the center

32:05.817 --> 32:08.858
is so we can analyze a number
of factors: depth, intensity,

32:08.860 --> 32:10.986
ground type, and
then we send a pulse

32:10.988 --> 32:13.196
to neutralize the quake
before it hits.

32:13.198 --> 32:14.699
Now that's incredible.

32:14.701 --> 32:18.286
Yeah,
it's pretty damn awesome.

32:18.288 --> 32:19.619
All right, folks, listen up!

32:19.621 --> 32:21.746
We got less than six hours,
all right?

32:21.748 --> 32:23.041
Let's get moving!

32:36.138 --> 32:37.430
Well, well, well.

32:37.432 --> 32:39.514
We have our
deployment orders, Ji.

32:39.516 --> 32:40.933
Apparently they found
someone who can turn

32:40.935 --> 32:43.685
this whole chaos maker
into a lifesaver.

32:43.687 --> 32:45.396
I don't mean to talk
out of turn, Colonel.

32:45.398 --> 32:46.981
Was that a joke?

32:46.983 --> 32:48.691
I've seen what that thing
can do firsthand.

32:48.693 --> 32:51.860
There's no way it can do
anything but destroy.

32:51.862 --> 32:55.865
I don't see how anyone can use
a seismic cannon for good.

32:55.867 --> 32:58.326
I know the eggheads who
invented this damn thing.

32:58.328 --> 33:00.869
I can confirm it was invented
with the intention

33:00.871 --> 33:03.998
of saving lives and
preventing earthquake.

33:04.000 --> 33:07.042
But we saw
the potential it had.

33:07.044 --> 33:10.671
An untapped weapon
with unlimited power.

33:10.673 --> 33:12.673
Well, thank God
we never fired it.

33:12.675 --> 33:15.216
Might start a World War III.

33:15.218 --> 33:17.302
So, where to, sir?

33:17.304 --> 33:19.180
Hollister, California.

33:19.182 --> 33:25.353
38.6 degrees north,
121.4 degrees west.

33:25.355 --> 33:27.187
Let's rock and roll, sergeant.

33:27.189 --> 33:28.357
Yes, sir!

33:31.945 --> 33:33.027
We ready?

33:33.029 --> 33:34.528
D.O.D. will meet us
in Hollister.

33:34.530 --> 33:36.905
Great. How about us?
Call us the chopper?

33:36.907 --> 33:38.406
I tried, but all of
the helicopters

33:38.408 --> 33:39.908
are being used for evac.

33:39.910 --> 33:41.368
We wouldn't be able
to get one to us in time

33:41.370 --> 33:42.994
even if it were
re-rerouted.

33:42.996 --> 33:45.289
I hope you
put gas in your truck.

33:45.291 --> 33:47.540
All right, we got a
90-minute drive ahead of us.

33:47.542 --> 33:49.128
Let's go save some lives.

34:07.397 --> 34:09.355
Isn't this the most
heavily mitigated building

34:09.357 --> 34:10.523
in the State of California
to prevent

34:10.525 --> 34:14.192
against earthquake damage?

34:14.194 --> 34:15.696
Everyone take cover!

34:20.493 --> 34:22.367
This is registering at a 6.5!

34:22.369 --> 34:24.913
These quakes are getting
even stronger with time!

34:30.460 --> 34:32.254
Everyone okay?

34:34.132 --> 34:35.672
You okay?

34:35.674 --> 34:37.592
You good.
Drew, you good?

34:37.594 --> 34:39.721
- Yeah.
- Deborah?

34:43.223 --> 34:45.474
Deborah?

34:45.476 --> 34:48.436
We only have four hours.

34:48.438 --> 34:50.145
What do you mean?

34:50.147 --> 34:52.230
I mean, we only have
four hours, not like

34:52.232 --> 34:54.233
the original six I calculated
earlier, but four hours!

34:54.235 --> 34:55.692
What happened?
Why did that change?

34:55.694 --> 34:57.570
The S waves are getting
even shallower.

34:57.572 --> 34:59.362
They're making new lines against
the fault with every quake.

34:59.364 --> 35:01.364
They have to be
practically near the surface

35:01.366 --> 35:02.366
for that to happen.

35:02.368 --> 35:03.784
They are on the surface.

35:03.786 --> 35:05.536
This is unlike anything
in recorded history.

35:05.538 --> 35:07.163
This is bad.

35:07.165 --> 35:08.496
I want to save California,
but I don't know how much more

35:08.498 --> 35:09.623
of this I can take.

35:09.625 --> 35:11.375
Look, we have to try.

35:11.377 --> 35:13.460
There's millions of lives
on the line, okay?

35:13.462 --> 35:15.003
We don't have any other choice.

35:15.005 --> 35:18.049
Drew, tell the D.O.D.
about the new timeline.

35:18.051 --> 35:19.844
All right, everyone, let's move!

35:31.940 --> 35:33.105
Sadie?

35:33.107 --> 35:35.023
Sadie?

35:35.025 --> 35:37.694
- Sadie, are you in here?
- Yes! Yes, I'm right here!

35:39.072 --> 35:40.445
All right.

35:40.447 --> 35:41.614
You're right, though.

35:41.616 --> 35:44.032
The door's completely blocked.

35:44.034 --> 35:46.076
I'm not gonna be able to get
through this on my own.

35:46.078 --> 35:47.703
I'm gonna need something.

35:47.705 --> 35:50.121
- Well, hey, check the closets.
- What?

35:50.123 --> 35:52.083
The company, we were doing
some renovating.

35:52.085 --> 35:55.795
Maybe they left some equipment
tucked away in the closets?

35:55.797 --> 35:57.295
Right, yeah.

35:57.297 --> 35:58.922
I think I remember
passing them on my way up.

35:58.924 --> 36:01.593
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay.

36:18.110 --> 36:19.362
[rumbling]

36:24.826 --> 36:26.828
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?

36:28.453 --> 36:29.579
Yes.

36:29.581 --> 36:33.293
Yeah, I'm good.
Don't worry.

37:03.447 --> 37:28.554
[rumbling]

37:28.556 --> 37:30.556
Hey, are you okay?

37:30.558 --> 37:33.018
Besides the state plunging
into the ocean, yeah.

37:35.772 --> 37:39.148
Sorry, I'm just
worried about Ingrid.

37:39.150 --> 37:42.237
Me, too.
Can you...

37:45.572 --> 37:48.616
They never prepare you for
the worrying you do as a parent.

37:48.618 --> 37:49.866
I know.

37:49.868 --> 37:51.451
At least she still
speaks to you.

37:51.453 --> 37:52.954
She won't even pick up
the phone when I call.

37:52.956 --> 37:55.538
There's still time
to change all that.

37:55.540 --> 37:58.541
I have a feeling after all this,
she'll come around.

37:58.543 --> 38:01.753
It's up to her if
she wants to see me again,

38:01.755 --> 38:04.507
if we even make it out of this.

38:04.509 --> 38:08.802
It looks like California
has a bit of activity.

38:08.804 --> 38:10.054
Foreshocks or aftershocks?

38:10.056 --> 38:13.056
Foreshocks.
Definitely foreshocks.

38:13.058 --> 38:15.476
But not too strong yet.

38:15.478 --> 38:18.813
They are 5.0s because

38:18.815 --> 38:20.982
they're further down
the fault than our 6.5s.

38:20.984 --> 38:23.483
But I imagine the timelines,

38:23.485 --> 38:27.070
as we get closer,
they're gonna get worse.

38:27.072 --> 38:28.905
Any other changes with that?

38:28.907 --> 38:32.576
No. The timeline
is holding steady

38:32.578 --> 38:35.246
at four hours for now.

38:35.248 --> 38:38.165
- Knock on wood.
- Let's hope it stays that way.

38:38.167 --> 38:39.833
Drew, you keeping in
contact with the D.O.D.?

38:39.835 --> 38:42.628
Yes. They're landing about
15 minutes ahead of us.

38:42.630 --> 38:43.840
Good.

39:07.779 --> 39:08.945
All right.

39:08.947 --> 39:10.364
Let's get this crate
on the ground.

39:10.366 --> 39:11.907
Those eggheads will
be here soon enough.

39:11.909 --> 39:13.286
Yes, sir.

39:17.873 --> 39:19.873
[rumbling]

39:19.875 --> 39:22.500
What the hell?
You feel that, Ji?

39:22.502 --> 39:24.004
Yeah, I sure did, sir.

39:39.895 --> 39:41.645
Oh, one heavy mother!

39:41.647 --> 39:43.732
It is a seismic cannon, sir.

39:54.243 --> 39:56.534
- Hey, Deb?
- Yeah?

39:56.536 --> 39:58.330
There it is.

39:59.456 --> 40:00.833
Here we go.

40:16.431 --> 40:18.891
Well, I'll be...
Colonel Lockner.

40:18.893 --> 40:20.433
I's a pleasure to see
you again, sir.

40:20.435 --> 40:22.353
Pleasure's all mine, Doctor.

40:22.355 --> 40:23.853
I'm Dr. Deborah Franklin.

40:23.855 --> 40:28.317
You have the bastardized version
of my invention under that tarp.

40:28.319 --> 40:33.489
Well, nice to meet you,
Dr. Franklin.

40:33.491 --> 40:35.907
We parked a safe distance
from that epicenter?

40:35.909 --> 40:38.034
Because I don't want that bird
destroyed if we can avoid it.

40:38.036 --> 40:39.744
Oh, yeah. We're just
outside the worst of it.

40:39.746 --> 40:42.706
Want to pull the truck up?

40:42.708 --> 40:43.625
Sure.

40:44.752 --> 41:04.770
Will you boys
help us load this up?

41:04.772 --> 41:06.523
Can't wait to see
it in action.

41:07.942 --> 41:09.319
Me, too.

41:18.994 --> 41:20.371
Whoa!

41:22.665 --> 41:24.748
Hold on!

41:24.750 --> 41:26.291
Everybody all right?

41:26.293 --> 41:30.337
- We're okay, we're okay.
- Yeah, we're okay!

41:30.339 --> 41:31.632
Hold on!

41:34.969 --> 41:36.677
- We're okay!
- Stay right there! Stay calm!

41:36.679 --> 41:39.179
- Yeah, guys, we're good.
- Hold on!

41:39.181 --> 41:40.973
All right!
Just sit tight!

41:40.975 --> 41:41.974
Hold on here a second!

41:41.976 --> 41:44.309
Put it in reverse.

41:44.311 --> 41:46.603
Take it easy.
Go easy.

41:46.605 --> 41:48.438
- Got it.
- Let's do it.

41:48.440 --> 41:49.567
Steady.

41:52.779 --> 41:56.407
Steady, steady, steady,
steady, steady, steady.

41:59.243 --> 42:00.909
We're not getting
any traction!

42:00.911 --> 42:04.788
Get into the back! Go!

42:04.790 --> 42:08.208
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
No, no! No doors! No doors!

42:08.210 --> 42:09.962
Get out the windows! Go out!

42:13.007 --> 42:15.299
- Go!
- Okay.

42:15.301 --> 42:17.134
Come on, Christine!
I got you!

42:17.136 --> 42:19.429
Be careful!
Go out the window!

42:22.266 --> 42:24.599
Right here, Christine!
Come here!

42:24.601 --> 42:26.226
I got you!

42:26.228 --> 42:29.189
- [screams]
- Drew!

42:35.904 --> 42:38.114
[crying]

42:38.116 --> 42:40.241
Colonel, we still need
more weight in the back!

42:40.243 --> 42:41.866
All right, you
listen to me, son.

42:41.868 --> 42:45.329
We got 180 extra pounds up here.
I'm gonna head into the back.

42:45.331 --> 42:48.876
I'm crawling in the back!
Stay where you are!

42:49.960 --> 42:51.710
Yes, sir.

42:51.712 --> 42:54.505
No, no! No doors!

42:54.507 --> 42:56.301
Not through the door.
Not through the door.

43:01.514 --> 43:02.890
No!

43:05.643 --> 43:07.893
- Punch it!
- Everybody hold on!

43:07.895 --> 43:10.605
Hold on! Hold on!

43:10.607 --> 43:12.148
You heard her, sergeant!
Punch it!

43:12.150 --> 43:13.940
Sir, yes, sir!

43:13.942 --> 43:16.278
Hold on!

43:19.114 --> 43:21.450
Drew! Drew!

43:23.619 --> 43:26.203
Please! We have to see
if he's okay, please!

43:26.205 --> 43:29.748
Ji, go down there
and check on their man.

43:29.750 --> 43:32.461
We ain't leaving
nobody behind.

43:47.935 --> 43:49.519
Be careful.

44:05.078 --> 44:06.329
Hey.

44:10.165 --> 44:12.416
You all right, soldier?

44:12.418 --> 44:15.962
I feel about
as good as I look.

44:15.964 --> 44:18.713
Okay, come on.

44:18.715 --> 44:20.632
Nope. Absolutely not.

44:20.634 --> 44:23.344
Can't just leave
a man behind.

44:23.346 --> 44:25.721
It's okay.

44:25.723 --> 44:26.806
[sighs]

44:26.808 --> 44:29.558
I don't wanna slow
you guys down.

44:29.560 --> 44:32.186
I'm not gonna be responsible
for countless more deaths.

44:32.188 --> 44:34.396
You're a real hero, you know.

44:34.398 --> 44:38.527
What you did up there,
I didn't think you were capable.

44:39.987 --> 44:43.072
California's my home.

44:43.074 --> 44:46.491
I'd do anything to protect it.

44:46.493 --> 44:47.536
Now go.

45:10.018 --> 45:12.603
[crying]

45:19.067 --> 45:20.485
Christine...

45:23.822 --> 45:26.324
Stay with us, okay?

45:26.326 --> 45:28.951
What would Drew say?

45:28.953 --> 45:30.788
Let's save California.

45:32.540 --> 45:35.081
That kid died a hero's death.

45:35.083 --> 45:38.253
We should all be lucky to go
out with that distinction.

45:44.052 --> 45:45.842
[sighs]

45:45.844 --> 45:48.513
All right, let's move 'em out.

46:16.333 --> 46:18.458
Are we at the correct
coordinates?

46:18.460 --> 46:21.128
Yes, Colonel, this is it.

46:21.130 --> 46:23.424
- Get that cannon out.
- Yes, sir.

46:38.147 --> 46:39.857
That's not good.

46:42.485 --> 46:44.277
It's all yours now, Deb.

46:44.279 --> 46:46.279
Think you can get restored her
back to her original intent?

46:46.281 --> 46:49.576
Yeah. Give me five minutes.
I got this.

46:51.493 --> 46:54.954
Oh, boy, what did these
idiots do to my baby?

46:54.956 --> 46:57.206
My God.
All right, make that 10 minutes.

46:57.208 --> 46:59.168
It isn't funny, Colonel.

47:01.170 --> 47:03.712
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

47:03.714 --> 47:05.297
Thank you so much for saving me.

47:05.299 --> 47:07.340
Of course, ma'am,
but we need to get out of here,

47:07.342 --> 47:08.594
we're not safe.

47:16.393 --> 47:19.022
Before this place caves
in on both of us.

47:21.357 --> 47:22.565
We can get
out of here, okay?

47:22.567 --> 47:23.610
Okay.

47:35.330 --> 47:36.329
Okay, I've got everything.

47:36.331 --> 47:38.166
Let's go.

47:54.598 --> 47:56.349
Okay, that ought to do it.

47:56.351 --> 47:58.976
- Well, I hope so.
- Sit right here, sir?

47:58.978 --> 48:01.686
Ask the doctor.
This is her show now.

48:01.688 --> 48:03.188
Yeah, this'll work.

48:03.190 --> 48:05.525
Yes, ma'am.
I'll grab the detonator.

48:11.156 --> 48:14.407
The shocks are getting
rapidly more intense.

48:14.409 --> 48:16.036
How long until
we reach full capacity?

48:21.793 --> 48:23.708
Okay, we've got
five minutes to warm up.

48:23.710 --> 48:26.378
And then I need to know the
instant an S wave hits, Werner.

48:26.380 --> 48:27.965
- Can you do that?
- You got it.

48:36.139 --> 48:37.514
How's it looking, Doc?

48:37.516 --> 48:39.268
It should be
ready momentarily.

48:43.605 --> 48:46.190
Okay, everybody
needs to back up!

48:46.192 --> 48:47.694
[machine whirring]

48:48.987 --> 48:50.444
[machine stops]

48:50.446 --> 48:52.195
Oh, no, no, no, no!

48:52.197 --> 48:55.407
What? What happened?

48:55.409 --> 48:59.411
I don't know, I don't know.
Give me a second!

48:59.413 --> 49:02.331
We don't have many
of those left.

49:02.333 --> 49:03.623
What's the ETA?

49:03.625 --> 49:05.543
Deb, we have less
than 60 seconds!

49:05.545 --> 49:09.337
- There's no way!
- I can fix it! Just trust me!

49:09.339 --> 49:12.257
The second that hits,
you tell us!

49:12.259 --> 49:15.469
- Can I help?
- I got this.

49:15.471 --> 49:16.721
I believe you,
but we need it now.

49:16.723 --> 49:18.723
Okay. Just hold on
these two buttons.

49:18.725 --> 49:22.434
- Let me try something.
- 30 seconds!

49:22.436 --> 49:23.853
Great! Are we set?

49:23.855 --> 49:25.523
Just keep holding the buttons!

49:28.985 --> 49:30.278
15 seconds!

49:35.824 --> 49:37.366
Deb...?

49:37.368 --> 49:38.366
Done!

49:38.368 --> 49:41.494
Two, one, go!

49:41.496 --> 49:43.081
[whirring]

49:54.177 --> 49:55.675
Hey, we just
stopped a mega quake!

49:55.677 --> 49:58.887
Why the hell aren't
you guys cheering?

49:58.889 --> 50:02.474
- What happened?
- Oh, no.

50:02.476 --> 50:04.893
What's it saying?

50:04.895 --> 50:07.020
I don't think we stopped it.

50:07.022 --> 50:10.065
I think the cannon sustained
damage in the earthquake.

50:10.067 --> 50:12.985
It's only showing 8% loaded.

50:12.987 --> 50:13.985
Damn it!

50:13.987 --> 50:15.612
Well, it must have
done something.

50:15.614 --> 50:17.530
I mean, the mega quake
didn't happen.

50:17.532 --> 50:20.701
Yet. We stopped it here.

50:20.703 --> 50:22.119
But we moved it
somewhere else.

50:22.121 --> 50:25.206
- Precisely.
- Any idea where that might be?

50:25.208 --> 50:28.041
Probably a place that
already is a hotbed of activity,

50:28.043 --> 50:30.503
you know, path
of least resistance.

50:30.505 --> 50:33.463
If I had to guess,
I would say...

50:33.465 --> 50:34.840
9- Los Angeles.

50:34.842 --> 50:37.842
- Well, that's great.
- Excuse me?

50:37.844 --> 50:40.429
I mean, the place is already
destroyed and evacuated, Werner.

50:40.431 --> 50:42.098
What the hell's
another earthquake

50:42.100 --> 50:43.641
in a completely ruined
and empty city?

50:43.643 --> 50:45.393
It's not completely
empty, Colonel.

50:45.395 --> 50:50.940
My... our daughter is in L.A.
evacuating people right now.

50:50.942 --> 50:53.358
Well, then you need
to call her.

50:53.360 --> 50:55.444
And you tell her
and everybody she's with

50:55.446 --> 50:58.114
they need to evacuate now.

50:58.116 --> 51:00.532
Oh, it's far worse
than that, Colonel.

51:00.534 --> 51:05.913
The entire San Andreas fault
is burning hot right now.

51:05.915 --> 51:08.541
Look, the mega quake is gonna
originate in Los Angeles

51:08.543 --> 51:10.041
and it's gonna rip up the coast.

51:10.043 --> 51:12.210
It's gonna break
the state into two pieces!

51:12.212 --> 51:13.420
There must be something
we can do.

51:13.422 --> 51:14.880
I mean, can't we fix the cannon?

51:14.882 --> 51:16.507
No. It's not worth the risk.

51:16.509 --> 51:19.467
If something goes wrong again,
it'll just do worse damage

51:19.469 --> 51:21.637
to California and
the surrounding states.

51:21.639 --> 51:23.764
It's not good,
it's not good.

51:23.766 --> 51:25.974
Then we need
to focus on Los Angeles.

51:25.976 --> 51:29.145
Whatever we need to be doing,
we need to be doing it there.

51:29.147 --> 51:30.813
Is there a time change
to the occurrence in L.A.

51:30.815 --> 51:32.607
different than what
we've already established?

51:32.609 --> 51:34.900
Well, we're still holding
steady at four hours.

51:34.902 --> 51:37.277
That'll give us enough time
to get in and get out.

51:37.279 --> 51:40.114
Right. We'll take a chopper.
Ji, take the truck.

51:40.116 --> 51:41.489
- Bring back the bird.
- Sir, yes, sir.

51:41.491 --> 51:43.199
All right, listen up.

51:43.201 --> 51:44.659
I'm gonna go check on Evac,
make sure we're still getting

51:44.661 --> 51:45.661
everybody as far east
as possible, all right?

51:45.663 --> 51:47.581
Excuse me.

51:50.460 --> 51:52.670
[cell phone rings]

51:53.837 --> 51:55.253
Is that your phone?

51:55.255 --> 51:56.588
No. My phone
hasn't been working.

51:56.590 --> 51:57.549
Well, it's not my phone.

52:02.554 --> 52:03.512
Dad?

52:03.514 --> 52:06.181
Oh, thank God!

52:06.183 --> 52:09.351
Please tell me you're
not still in L.A.

52:09.353 --> 52:11.686
No, I am. I'm stuck
in this building.

52:11.688 --> 52:14.607
Trying to find a way out.
Still saving lives.

52:14.609 --> 52:17.275
No, you need to get
out of there right now!

52:17.277 --> 52:19.362
Why? What's going on?

52:19.364 --> 52:20.737
Okay, listen to me, honey.

52:20.739 --> 52:23.324
Los Angeles is about to
be ground zero for a mega quake

52:23.326 --> 52:25.451
so catastrophic it's gonna
punch everything west

52:25.453 --> 52:28.411
of the San Andreas
into the ocean.

52:28.413 --> 52:30.498
- How long until the mega quake?
- Not long.

52:30.500 --> 52:32.541
That's why you need to get out
of there right now.

52:32.543 --> 52:34.251
Dad, I...

52:34.253 --> 52:35.628
No, no, no, no. You just
listen to me, okay, baby?

52:35.630 --> 52:36.878
You get out of
there right now!

52:36.880 --> 52:38.547
If anything were ever
to happen to you, I...

52:38.549 --> 52:40.840
Okay, okay, I promise.

52:40.842 --> 52:42.300
The second I get out of here,

52:42.302 --> 52:43.719
I'm driving east as
quickly as I can.

52:43.721 --> 52:46.096
That's my girl.

52:46.098 --> 52:47.348
I love you.

52:47.350 --> 52:50.976
I love you, too.

52:50.978 --> 52:52.353
I love you too, sweetheart.

52:52.355 --> 52:53.563
Mom, is that you?

52:53.565 --> 52:55.690
Yeah. Hi.

52:55.692 --> 52:59.360
Hi. It's good to
hear your voice.

52:59.362 --> 53:02.112
Listen, Ingrid, your dad and
I are trying to do everything

53:02.114 --> 53:03.655
to stop this quake
from happening.

53:03.657 --> 53:06.366
But we need you to get out
of Los Angeles ASAP.

53:06.368 --> 53:09.328
Well, you guys are
working on it together,

53:09.330 --> 53:10.704
it must be serious.

53:10.706 --> 53:11.706
Just get outta there, baby.

53:11.708 --> 53:12.915
I love you guys.

53:12.917 --> 53:19.630
- Love you too, honey.
- Love you, Ingrid.

53:19.632 --> 53:20.880
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

53:20.882 --> 53:22.342
We need to get
out of here now.

53:31.603 --> 53:33.184
Is there any other
way out of here?

53:33.186 --> 53:35.478
Do you know... parking lot,
parking garage,

53:35.480 --> 53:36.480
fire escape, anything?

53:36.482 --> 53:37.940
Yeah. Right this way.

53:37.942 --> 53:39.692
All right, team.
Here's what we're gonna do.

53:39.694 --> 53:41.902
We're gonna get onboard
that chopper.

53:41.904 --> 53:44.822
We're gonna fly our
asses down to Los Angeles

53:44.824 --> 53:46.699
and we're gonna devise
a plan on the way.

53:46.701 --> 53:47.824
No. We're not going
anywhere until

53:47.826 --> 53:49.911
we have an exact plan in place.

53:49.913 --> 53:51.913
- Hold on.
- What is it?

53:51.915 --> 53:53.915
It looks like
magmatic processes

53:53.917 --> 53:58.418
have increased since after
we tried the cannon.

53:58.420 --> 54:00.378
Deborah, the rift.

54:00.380 --> 54:01.880
Is it still showing
as being shallow?

54:01.882 --> 54:03.340
Is this still correct?

54:03.342 --> 54:06.092
Yeah, it looks like
the depth is consistent.

54:06.094 --> 54:07.427
Well, I don't think
it's gonna work.

54:07.429 --> 54:09.304
Anything is worth
a shot now, Jan.

54:09.306 --> 54:10.639
[sighs]

54:10.641 --> 54:13.601
What if we we made
a volcano from the tar pits?

54:13.603 --> 54:16.603
The fault line runs right
next to the La Brea Tar Pits,

54:16.605 --> 54:19.773
which would be the easiest place
to access the magma below.

54:19.775 --> 54:22.150
If we created a volcano...

54:22.152 --> 54:25.737
Then the resulting lava
would flow into the shallow rift

54:25.739 --> 54:27.572
and potentially
seal the fissure.

54:27.574 --> 54:30.451
Exactly.

54:30.453 --> 54:32.328
I love it.

54:32.330 --> 54:34.788
Okay, I'm in.

54:34.790 --> 54:37.250
Okay, but the magma
at the location we choose

54:37.252 --> 54:39.460
- would need to be thin.
- Why is that?

54:39.462 --> 54:42.797
Well, with thin magma,
you have more gasses

54:42.799 --> 54:44.382
that are released and,
with that,

54:44.384 --> 54:46.342
you wouldn't
have an explosion.

54:46.344 --> 54:49.302
- Which is not what we want.
- No. We don't want that.

54:49.304 --> 54:52.264
Okay, well, it looks
like it's this location.

54:52.266 --> 54:58.228
Yeah, the lava's thin,
the magma's thin.

54:58.230 --> 55:00.188
I don't mean to rain
on y'all's parade here.

55:00.190 --> 55:03.442
But how in God's green earth
are you gonna create a volcano

55:03.444 --> 55:05.735
just out of nowhere?

55:05.737 --> 55:08.405
That's the million
dollar question.

55:08.407 --> 55:10.824
Well, the seismic cannon
would have been strong enough

55:10.826 --> 55:13.828
to agitate the magma below
and bring it to the surface,

55:13.830 --> 55:15.204
but it's busted.

55:15.206 --> 55:17.498
How long will it
take to fix it?

55:17.500 --> 55:19.875
It'll take longer to fix
than California has to spare.

55:19.877 --> 55:21.793
It's not an option.

55:21.795 --> 55:24.713
Aren't you Marines
combat engineers?

55:24.715 --> 55:26.215
Yes, we are.

55:26.217 --> 55:28.134
Could they use an explosive
device to raise the magma?

55:28.136 --> 55:30.594
Do you seriously think
we're gonna be able

55:30.596 --> 55:32.721
to access enough explosives
to create a volcano

55:32.723 --> 55:34.514
with one simple
phone call, do you?

55:34.516 --> 55:35.849
Well, I...

55:35.851 --> 55:37.934
There's protocol!
There's a hierarchy!

55:37.936 --> 55:40.813
Well, I hope they show
some leniency, given that this

55:40.815 --> 55:43.107
is a potential
cataclysmic event, Colonel.

55:43.109 --> 55:46.527
Well, I'd like to see you
tone it down, civilian!

55:46.529 --> 55:48.362
Guys, we're on
the same team here!

55:48.364 --> 55:49.864
Why don't you
back off, woman?

55:49.866 --> 55:52.616
Hell, you been after
my resignation ever

55:52.618 --> 55:54.534
since the Department
of Defense took over the

55:54.536 --> 55:55.619
control of your device!

55:55.621 --> 55:56.829
Excuse me?

55:56.831 --> 55:58.538
Yeah, that's right!

55:58.540 --> 56:01.250
You don't think I've seen
the letters, your emails

56:01.252 --> 56:03.251
and every interview
you've damn well done?

56:03.253 --> 56:05.545
Now I don't know how
much further up I can go

56:05.547 --> 56:07.465
with Command to help you,
so back off me!

56:07.467 --> 56:10.092
- You hold on a minute.
- For me?

56:10.094 --> 56:13.054
Who do you think
I'm doing this for, Lockner?

56:13.056 --> 56:14.889
It's Colonel to you.

56:14.891 --> 56:16.681
Okay, yes.

56:16.683 --> 56:18.643
I was and, frankly,
am still upset

56:18.645 --> 56:22.063
with the Department of Defense
for stealing my device!

56:22.065 --> 56:24.982
The D.O.D.
funded your device!

56:24.984 --> 56:27.817
And then stole it and
altered it against my will

56:27.819 --> 56:29.152
and against the better judgment

56:29.154 --> 56:31.739
of the entire
scientific community!

56:31.741 --> 56:34.741
You weaponized earthquakes!

56:34.743 --> 56:37.203
We tried to turn
the tide, ma'am.

56:37.205 --> 56:40.288
You were trying to kill
thousands of people.

56:40.290 --> 56:42.208
Their blood would
have been on my hands!

56:42.210 --> 56:45.295
That was not my intention
when I created this device!

56:47.882 --> 56:51.384
But now we can put
the past behind us

56:51.386 --> 56:55.929
if you can just get us the
explosives we need to fix this.

56:55.931 --> 56:58.891
Lockner, we can save millions.

56:58.893 --> 57:00.270
And...

57:02.355 --> 57:05.105
And you can make up
for all that you cost me.

57:05.107 --> 57:08.277
Look, you cost me a lot.
You cost me my job.

57:10.654 --> 57:12.904
My marriage.

57:12.906 --> 57:15.991
But all of that
wouldn't matter for a second

57:15.993 --> 57:20.371
if you can get
the explosives we need.

57:20.373 --> 57:22.956
Can you do that?

57:22.958 --> 57:24.791
Can you get us
the ordnance, Colonel?

57:24.793 --> 57:28.170
Well, we'd need a BLU-117
hard target bomb,

57:28.172 --> 57:30.965
and that weighs 2,000 pounds.

57:30.967 --> 57:32.425
How do we get one of those?

57:32.427 --> 57:34.050
I make a call.

57:34.052 --> 57:36.344
Okay. So we drop the charge
at an appropriate depth.

57:36.346 --> 57:40.808
We get a remote detonation
and I think this could work.

57:40.810 --> 57:43.936
Well, if anybody can figure
this out, it's you, doctor.

57:43.938 --> 57:47.648
Right. So the blast itself
may only penetrate

57:47.650 --> 57:48.858
a few hundred feet.

57:48.860 --> 57:51.402
But even thin magma
has a high viscosity.

57:51.404 --> 57:54.905
And the shockwave
that's resulting from this

57:54.907 --> 57:56.532
would be enough at that depth

57:56.534 --> 58:00.244
to send the resulting
magma into the fault.

58:00.246 --> 58:02.540
[helicopter rotors]

58:05.835 --> 58:07.628
- Sounds good to me.
- Okay.

58:11.965 --> 58:13.090
All right,
I'll make the call.

58:13.092 --> 58:14.634
Thanks, Colonel.

58:14.636 --> 58:16.384
The chopper's ready
for the cannon, sir.

58:16.386 --> 58:19.012
Leave the cannon.
It's just gonna weigh us down.

58:19.014 --> 58:20.014
But, sir....

58:20.016 --> 58:21.849
Now you listen to me.

58:21.851 --> 58:22.974
When we get out of this mess,

58:22.976 --> 58:24.476
we'll come back here
and collect it.

58:24.478 --> 58:25.978
Right now,
it's a 250-pound paperweight.

58:25.980 --> 58:27.020
Let's load up.

58:27.022 --> 58:28.648
Hoorah!

58:28.650 --> 58:30.860
I've always wanted to say it.
It's fun.

58:33.904 --> 58:37.030
- Come on, let's move.
- Let's go, Deb.

58:37.032 --> 58:40.078
Yeah, uh, I need a minute.

58:45.792 --> 58:48.833
Don't worry, ma'am.
You're safe with me.

58:48.835 --> 58:50.837
Yeah, I've heard that before.

59:05.936 --> 59:08.228
Sorry. Force of habit.

59:08.230 --> 59:11.357
I think you're
more nervous than I am.

59:11.359 --> 59:14.112
Well, we're about to find out.

59:23.996 --> 59:27.331
Ji, this is something
you can do, correct?

59:27.333 --> 59:29.875
Affirmative, sir.
No problem.

59:29.877 --> 59:33.337
We need a medium duty crane,
rig it onto a solid surface,

59:33.339 --> 59:36.465
a normal remote detonation
battery pack.

59:36.467 --> 59:38.134
Fuse it to the bomb,
scramble the sonar

59:38.136 --> 59:40.052
and program it to work
with our depth meter.

59:40.054 --> 59:45.266
Shouldn't be a problem at all
as long as we get it on time.

59:45.268 --> 59:48.184
166th Tiltrotor Squadron,
Sea Elk.

59:48.186 --> 59:49.978
Captain Fiske.
Authenticate.

59:49.980 --> 59:53.565
Colonel Rex Lockner.
Authenticate.

59:53.567 --> 59:59.154
Tango Tango Romeo Sierra
one seven niner six four Zulu.

59:59.156 --> 01:00:01.991
Authentication confirmed.
This line is secure.

01:00:01.993 --> 01:00:03.366
What can I do for you, Colonel?

01:00:03.368 --> 01:00:07.288
I need a BLU-117
conventional bomb,

01:00:07.290 --> 01:00:10.958
directional shape charge,
downward radius.

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:16.505
Need a medium duty crane.
I need a...

01:00:16.507 --> 01:00:19.007
Looks like we're
making good time.

01:00:19.009 --> 01:00:21.052
Yeah.

01:00:21.054 --> 01:00:24.221
Can you imagine if we had
to drive the whole way there?

01:00:24.223 --> 01:00:26.349
No way we'd make it.

01:00:26.351 --> 01:00:27.891
I'm the last person
I thought would be appreciating

01:00:27.893 --> 01:00:29.684
the Department of
Defense right now.

01:00:29.686 --> 01:00:31.186
But I got to say,
they're killing it.

01:00:31.188 --> 01:00:32.771
- Right?
- Yeah.

01:00:32.773 --> 01:00:34.523
See? I told you
they're not all that bad.

01:00:34.525 --> 01:00:36.983
Did you get a chance
to call your daughter?

01:00:36.985 --> 01:00:41.572
Yeah, we talked to Ingrid.

01:00:41.574 --> 01:00:43.366
I told her to get out
as soon as possible.

01:00:43.368 --> 01:00:46.034
I sure hope
she listened to us this time.

01:00:46.036 --> 01:00:47.744
I hope so too.

01:00:47.746 --> 01:00:51.331
I've been running Dr. Franklin's
numbers pretty consistently.

01:00:51.333 --> 01:00:55.087
And it looks like four hours
is our best case scenario.

01:01:10.435 --> 01:01:13.145
Well, that's too far for
either one of us to jump.

01:01:13.147 --> 01:01:16.732
Are you sure we can't
go back the way you came in?

01:01:16.734 --> 01:01:18.319
No. Everything caved in
on the way up.

01:01:20.697 --> 01:01:23.322
[crying]

01:01:23.324 --> 01:01:24.864
I'm not even supposed
to be here!

01:01:24.866 --> 01:01:26.366
I'm supposed to be up
north with my friends...

01:01:26.368 --> 01:01:29.203
Sadie, Sadie?
I need you to calm down, okay?

01:01:29.205 --> 01:01:30.788
I need you to be here with me.

01:01:30.790 --> 01:01:33.833
I need your help just as
much as you need mine, okay?

01:01:33.835 --> 01:01:37.003
And we're gonna get
out of this, all right?

01:01:37.005 --> 01:01:38.087
Do you trust me?

01:01:38.089 --> 01:01:39.547
Okay.

01:01:39.549 --> 01:01:41.465
I need you to stay right here
and I'll be right back.

01:01:41.467 --> 01:01:45.054
I have an idea, okay? Okay.

01:01:55.732 --> 01:01:58.065
We're too high up
to use it to go down.

01:01:58.067 --> 01:02:02.069
Well, we're not
using it for that.

01:02:02.071 --> 01:02:06.072
We're using it to go across.

01:02:06.074 --> 01:02:07.784
Can you give me a hand?

01:02:11.496 --> 01:02:13.875
Here we go, one, two three.

01:02:17.878 --> 01:02:19.297
After you?

01:02:24.134 --> 01:02:25.425
We all set?

01:02:25.427 --> 01:02:28.887
It's on the way.
We're good to go.

01:02:28.889 --> 01:02:30.139
Good job, Colonel.

01:02:30.141 --> 01:02:32.141
Is there any way we can
pick up the pace here?

01:02:32.143 --> 01:02:34.643
I'd hate to run into a time
crunch if we can avoid it.

01:02:34.645 --> 01:02:36.186
I don't wanna push
this bird too hard.

01:02:36.188 --> 01:02:39.273
We didn't have time to do
a full and proper inspection

01:02:39.275 --> 01:02:40.523
before takeoff.

01:02:40.525 --> 01:02:42.150
And there's a chance
it took some damage

01:02:42.152 --> 01:02:43.569
from the quakes we're endured.

01:02:43.571 --> 01:02:46.279
We're getting there faster
than any ground vehicle.

01:02:46.281 --> 01:02:47.950
I guarantee you that.

01:02:50.286 --> 01:02:52.078
You got any family
in California, sergeant?

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:53.704
I do not, sir.

01:02:53.706 --> 01:02:56.331
Close friends or folks
you can't imagine losing?

01:02:56.333 --> 01:02:58.750
I'm afraid not, sir.

01:02:58.752 --> 01:03:02.045
Well, if you did, wouldn't you
do everything possible

01:03:02.047 --> 01:03:05.090
if it was in your ability to do
so to keep that from happening?

01:03:05.092 --> 01:03:06.259
Of course.

01:03:06.261 --> 01:03:08.511
Well, I got a daughter
in Los Angeles.

01:03:08.513 --> 01:03:11.514
I can't imagine living
without her, especially if I had

01:03:11.516 --> 01:03:14.058
the chance to save her and
missed by just a few minutes.

01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:16.768
All right, you got it.

01:03:16.770 --> 01:03:18.353
Thank you.

01:03:18.355 --> 01:03:22.359
Thank you, sir.

01:03:24.946 --> 01:03:26.654
[alarm blares]

01:03:26.656 --> 01:03:29.155
Hold on!

01:03:29.157 --> 01:03:31.368
I told you we shouldn't
speed things up!

01:03:32.744 --> 01:03:34.996
[screams]

01:03:34.998 --> 01:03:36.329
Hang on to something!

01:03:36.331 --> 01:03:38.542
This isn't gonna be fun!

01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:44.131
Caution!
Manual fuel! Manual fuel!

01:03:46.467 --> 01:03:48.967
Caution! Caution!
Manual fuel!

01:03:48.969 --> 01:03:51.344
Hold on, Christine!

01:03:51.346 --> 01:03:52.679
[screams]

01:03:52.681 --> 01:04:01.021
Hold on!

01:04:01.023 --> 01:04:03.315
Deb, you okay?

01:04:03.317 --> 01:04:04.985
Oh, God.

01:04:10.282 --> 01:04:11.239
Deb, you okay?

01:04:11.241 --> 01:04:13.241
Yeah, yeah.
Are you okay?

01:04:13.243 --> 01:04:14.411
Yeah.

01:04:16.121 --> 01:04:17.371
The computer's good.

01:04:17.373 --> 01:04:18.541
Christine?

01:04:19.542 --> 01:04:21.918
Where's Lockner?

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:24.003
Lockner!

01:04:24.005 --> 01:04:26.838
- Colonel!
- Ji!

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:32.302
Oh, thank God.

01:04:32.304 --> 01:04:33.679
You think
that's the first bird

01:04:33.681 --> 01:04:36.056
- I've ridden in hot, do you, Doc?
- No.

01:04:36.058 --> 01:04:38.934
I told you we shouldn't
have sped that thing up!

01:04:38.936 --> 01:04:40.186
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:04:40.188 --> 01:04:42.145
I was under the impression
that you could do your job!

01:04:42.147 --> 01:04:45.233
I been flying that bird
for years

01:04:45.235 --> 01:04:48.610
and I told you we shouldn't
increase our speed!

01:04:48.612 --> 01:04:50.362
Look, I'm just trying to save
my daughter

01:04:50.364 --> 01:04:52.614
and get to Los Angeles
a little faster, okay?

01:04:52.616 --> 01:04:55.992
We were getting there
just fine until you made me

01:04:55.994 --> 01:04:58.411
go against
my professional judgment.

01:04:58.413 --> 01:05:01.581
Now we'll be lucky
to get to L.A.

01:05:01.583 --> 01:05:03.541
so we can waste more time
saving your daughter.

01:05:03.543 --> 01:05:05.043
What did you say,
you piece of...

01:05:05.045 --> 01:05:07.380
Hey, hey, guys!
We cannot fall apart now!

01:05:07.382 --> 01:05:08.880
We've come too far. No!

01:05:08.882 --> 01:05:12.425
Stand down, soldier.
That's an order.

01:05:12.427 --> 01:05:14.094
The guy's just trying
to save his family.

01:05:14.096 --> 01:05:16.264
Hell, as a man with a wife
and two daughters at home,

01:05:16.266 --> 01:05:17.848
I know what he's going through.

01:05:17.850 --> 01:05:19.058
But, sir...

01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:20.016
No buts!

01:05:20.018 --> 01:05:23.688
So what?
We crashed a damn chopper!

01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:25.398
You think a bird going down
has ever stopped me

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:26.857
from getting finished
with every mission

01:05:26.859 --> 01:05:30.527
I've ever had in my career?

01:05:30.529 --> 01:05:32.279
Now I know it
looks grim out here.

01:05:32.281 --> 01:05:34.030
But it usually does before it
starts getting better!

01:05:34.032 --> 01:05:35.532
And that's just the way it is!

01:05:35.534 --> 01:05:37.326
But we can't be
at each other's throats,

01:05:37.328 --> 01:05:41.663
not when we got lives to save!
Do you get that?

01:05:41.665 --> 01:05:46.460
From now on, I'll let
you handle the seismology.

01:05:46.462 --> 01:05:49.255
And you let me handle
my area of expertise.

01:05:49.257 --> 01:05:51.092
Deal?

01:05:54.679 --> 01:05:56.887
Deal.

01:05:56.889 --> 01:05:59.891
All right, let's try
and find a truck.

01:05:59.893 --> 01:06:02.061
We have a mega quake to stop.

01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:12.696
I think I saw
something that way.

01:06:41.308 --> 01:06:44.184
Hey, guys, I don't think we're
gonna be able to find a car.

01:06:44.186 --> 01:06:46.853
Everyone's evacuated.

01:06:46.855 --> 01:06:48.480
Well, we can't lose hope now.

01:06:48.482 --> 01:06:50.315
We're the only ones
that can save California.

01:06:50.317 --> 01:06:53.152
Guys, maybe...

01:06:53.154 --> 01:06:54.364
Well, out with it.

01:06:55.906 --> 01:07:00.242
Maybe we should think about
ourselves for a second.

01:07:00.244 --> 01:07:01.996
What if we run out of time?

01:07:03.998 --> 01:07:05.413
You're not saying what
I think you're saying,

01:07:05.415 --> 01:07:06.706
are you, Christine?

01:07:06.708 --> 01:07:08.793
I'm just saying what
if we don't find a car?

01:07:08.795 --> 01:07:12.755
I mean, we keep getting hit
with these quakes and, you know,

01:07:12.757 --> 01:07:14.215
they keep slowing us down.

01:07:14.217 --> 01:07:16.217
You get that
thought out of your head.

01:07:16.219 --> 01:07:19.929
We will find a car.
We'll drive to L.A.

01:07:19.931 --> 01:07:22.016
And we're going to save Ingrid.

01:07:25.561 --> 01:07:26.811
What if we don't, Werner?

01:07:26.813 --> 01:07:30.355
I mean, look at us.
This is who's left.

01:07:30.357 --> 01:07:32.650
We had a perfect plan
and everything went wrong.

01:07:32.652 --> 01:07:34.317
I just don't want
to lose anybody else.

01:07:34.319 --> 01:07:36.445
Christine...

01:07:36.447 --> 01:07:39.949
[crying]

01:07:39.951 --> 01:07:43.578
Christine, look.
I know it's been a rough day.

01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:46.746
Understatement of the century.

01:07:46.748 --> 01:07:50.458
Maybe, but, you know Drew.

01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:51.626
I didn't know him that well.

01:07:51.628 --> 01:07:53.587
But if he were here,
I know what he would do.

01:07:53.589 --> 01:07:54.672
Do you know what he would do?

01:07:54.674 --> 01:07:57.215
- What?
- He'd keep fighting.

01:07:57.217 --> 01:08:00.969
He loved the BEWDC
and he loved California.

01:08:00.971 --> 01:08:04.223
He wouldn't let anything
stop him from saving California.

01:08:04.225 --> 01:08:07.768
He laid down his life
so that we could keep going.

01:08:07.770 --> 01:08:10.896
I know it's scary, okay?

01:08:10.898 --> 01:08:12.523
We're all scared,

01:08:12.525 --> 01:08:14.400
the most scared I've ever
been in my entire life.

01:08:14.402 --> 01:08:18.237
But we can't let fear stop us
in our tracks, all right?

01:08:18.238 --> 01:08:21.363
We have a responsibility
not only for the lives

01:08:21.366 --> 01:08:24.078
of millions of Californians,
but to save our own as well.

01:08:26.413 --> 01:08:31.042
- For Drew.
- For Drew.

01:08:31.044 --> 01:08:32.710
Hey, guys!

01:08:32.712 --> 01:08:35.630
I found something I think
you're gonna like!

01:08:35.631 --> 01:08:36.587
What do you got?

01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:45.598
Come on!
I'll show you!

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:47.600
All right, your turn.

01:08:47.602 --> 01:08:49.143
I can't do it!
I can't do it!

01:08:49.145 --> 01:08:57.274
Yes, you can, Sadie!
I got you!

01:08:57.277 --> 01:08:58.569
[rumbling]

01:09:02.241 --> 01:09:04.533
I can't do it!
I can't do it!

01:09:04.535 --> 01:09:06.077
Sadie, don't let go!

01:09:06.078 --> 01:09:07.827
- I can't!
- Sadie, don't let go!

01:09:07.828 --> 01:09:09.703
Whatever you do,
don't let go, Sadie!

01:09:09.706 --> 01:09:11.042
You can do this!

01:09:17.214 --> 01:09:18.881
Just keep looking at me.

01:09:18.883 --> 01:09:19.801
Hold on.

01:09:22.719 --> 01:09:31.060
You can do this, Sadie.

01:09:31.062 --> 01:09:34.479
See? Told you that
you could do it.

01:09:34.481 --> 01:09:36.109
Let's just get outta here.

01:09:41.446 --> 01:09:44.573
- No keys.
- Want me to see if I can help?

01:09:44.575 --> 01:09:46.368
Be my guest.

01:09:47.661 --> 01:09:49.743
This ought to be good.

01:09:49.746 --> 01:09:52.165
Oh, this ought
to be real good.

01:09:55.712 --> 01:09:57.377
[engine starts]

01:09:57.379 --> 01:09:59.255
Well, well, well.

01:09:59.257 --> 01:10:00.633
What do we have here?

01:10:05.554 --> 01:10:06.595
What?

01:10:06.597 --> 01:10:08.181
I grew up on the
south side of Chicago.

01:10:13.103 --> 01:10:14.731
It looks like
a war zone out there.

01:10:16.732 --> 01:10:18.150
Deb, how much time
do we have left?

01:10:20.152 --> 01:10:21.695
57 minutes.

01:10:29.161 --> 01:10:30.744
We gotta move!

01:10:30.746 --> 01:10:32.454
How long before that chopper
gets here with the explosives?

01:10:32.456 --> 01:10:33.706
They're in the air!
Should be 10 or 15 minutes!

01:10:33.708 --> 01:10:34.707
[rumbling]

01:10:34.709 --> 01:10:36.377
Oh!

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:42.756
Is this still a foreshock
or are we too late?

01:10:42.758 --> 01:10:45.342
All right.
Let's go check on those pits.

01:10:45.344 --> 01:10:46.260
Deb, any changes?

01:10:46.262 --> 01:10:47.845
No, we're holding strong,

01:10:47.847 --> 01:10:49.721
but these quakes are just
gonna get more intense

01:10:49.723 --> 01:10:52.308
until we get the big one.
God, I hope the chopper's okay.

01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:53.227
Me, too.

01:11:06.156 --> 01:11:08.491
Gotta work with what we got.

01:11:08.493 --> 01:11:10.618
These pits are how deep?

01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:12.869
About 23 feet
and, obviously,

01:11:12.871 --> 01:11:15.747
the pressure fissures
go much deeper.

01:11:15.749 --> 01:11:18.710
Sir, how much time do you
think we'll need? How far?

01:11:21.088 --> 01:11:23.672
Well, we're gonna need
at least a mile clearance.

01:11:23.674 --> 01:11:27.176
Not because of
the blast radius, uh-uh.

01:11:27.178 --> 01:11:28.970
Because all these
remaining structures

01:11:28.972 --> 01:11:32.098
are gonna come
crashing down on us.

01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:33.935
[helicopter rotors]

01:11:42.986 --> 01:11:45.363
Forward, forward!

01:11:47.490 --> 01:11:48.741
Keep going!

01:11:51.285 --> 01:11:52.995
Hold! Hold!

01:11:57.458 --> 01:11:58.750
Hold!

01:12:15.351 --> 01:12:17.018
Give me a hand with this,
sergeant.

01:12:17.020 --> 01:12:19.811
All right.
Everybody clear the area!

01:12:19.813 --> 01:12:21.982
Chopper setting down!

01:12:24.861 --> 01:12:35.912
[rumbling]

01:12:35.914 --> 01:12:38.288
You don't think
that Ingrid may...

01:12:38.290 --> 01:12:41.500
She's long gone by now.

01:12:41.502 --> 01:12:43.045
At least I hope so.

01:12:44.422 --> 01:12:46.380
We need to move
that damn explosive.

01:12:46.382 --> 01:12:48.632
Everything we needed
was on that wreck.

01:12:48.634 --> 01:12:53.720
Well, in all my years
of education, research

01:12:53.722 --> 01:12:56.765
and scientific discovery

01:12:56.767 --> 01:12:59.060
leads me
but to one conclusion.

01:12:59.062 --> 01:13:02.646
Well, what's that, Werner?

01:13:02.648 --> 01:13:06.149
We push it... together.

01:13:06.151 --> 01:13:07.859
Where do we need to get it?

01:13:07.861 --> 01:13:09.528
Deep into the pit, guys.
Deep.

01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:11.863
- All right.
- Get it to the edge right here.

01:13:11.865 --> 01:13:13.783
Push, push, push.

01:13:13.785 --> 01:13:16.287
[grunting]
Come on.

01:13:19.123 --> 01:13:21.082
So where are we exactly?

01:13:21.084 --> 01:13:22.707
Sometimes when we
have an overflow of repairs,

01:13:22.709 --> 01:13:24.085
we outsource to other hangars,

01:13:24.087 --> 01:13:26.711
small Humvees, aircraft,
nothing too big.

01:13:26.713 --> 01:13:29.883
Okay, well, I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:13:42.730 --> 01:13:45.564
Do you know how to fly
one of those things?

01:13:45.566 --> 01:13:48.149
Yeah. Sort of.

01:13:48.151 --> 01:13:49.943
What do you mean, sort of?

01:13:49.945 --> 01:13:53.863
I mean, I was two tests
away from passing my exam.

01:13:53.865 --> 01:13:55.116
Well, it's either this

01:13:55.118 --> 01:13:58.577
or we try and
get outta here on the ground.

01:13:58.579 --> 01:14:00.914
Come on.

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:09.882
Okay. Put these on.

01:14:11.968 --> 01:14:13.386
Great...

01:14:15.972 --> 01:14:17.637
Looks good.

01:14:17.639 --> 01:14:19.223
[rotors start]

01:14:19.225 --> 01:14:21.311
- Great. You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

01:14:22.603 --> 01:14:24.144
Yeah.

01:14:24.146 --> 01:14:26.521
[engine sputtering]

01:14:26.523 --> 01:14:27.814
All right.

01:14:27.816 --> 01:14:29.233
Something must have shaken
out there in the quake.

01:14:29.235 --> 01:14:31.195
I'm gonna go check it out,
all right?

01:14:41.789 --> 01:14:43.538
Push, push!

01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:45.416
[rumbling]

01:14:45.418 --> 01:14:47.417
It's growing in intensity!

01:14:47.419 --> 01:14:48.793
- Two, three! Push!
- We don't have much time!

01:14:48.795 --> 01:14:50.964
Less than 20 minutes!

01:14:54.636 --> 01:14:55.842
Push!

01:14:55.844 --> 01:14:58.386
Right to the edge
of the rift, come, come!

01:14:58.388 --> 01:15:01.015
Okay, guys, right to
the edge here!

01:15:01.017 --> 01:15:03.434
Right here! Come on!
Move it!

01:15:03.436 --> 01:15:04.353
Okay...

01:15:05.812 --> 01:15:08.190
Okay, we've got 20 minutes!

01:15:15.781 --> 01:15:17.113
Are we ready?

01:15:17.115 --> 01:15:20.117
Just about.

01:15:20.119 --> 01:15:22.163
All right.
Ready, sir.

01:15:24.915 --> 01:15:26.873
Okay, looks like
we are all right.

01:15:26.875 --> 01:15:28.708
We are right on schedule, guys.

01:15:28.710 --> 01:15:30.043
Oh, thank God.

01:15:30.045 --> 01:15:31.962
There's only millions
of lives on the line.

01:15:31.964 --> 01:15:34.172
Yeah, right?
No pressure.

01:15:34.174 --> 01:15:35.800
No pressure.

01:15:35.802 --> 01:15:39.552
Hey, this is crazy, but if
we survive this thing,

01:15:39.554 --> 01:15:42.139
you, me, Ingrid,
go get dinner?

01:15:42.141 --> 01:15:45.100
Something like that?

01:15:45.102 --> 01:15:46.726
I think she'd like that.

01:15:46.728 --> 01:15:50.730
Hey... hey, guys,
is that what I...

01:15:50.732 --> 01:15:52.110
[rumbling]

01:15:56.697 --> 01:15:58.657
[coughing]

01:16:20.929 --> 01:16:23.682
Lockner, what happens if
the bomb falls into lava?

01:16:27.562 --> 01:16:31.939
A quick and painless death,
I can guarantee you that.

01:16:31.941 --> 01:16:36.029
All right, we need
to get back up top now!

01:16:41.034 --> 01:16:42.744
[rumbling]

01:16:54.297 --> 01:16:56.507
Do you know what's
wrong with it yet?

01:17:01.219 --> 01:17:03.136
[motor starts]

01:17:03.138 --> 01:17:04.473
Got it!

01:17:13.106 --> 01:17:15.399
All right.

01:17:15.401 --> 01:17:17.400
You ever flown in
a helicopter before?

01:17:17.402 --> 01:17:20.738
No, but I like
roller coasters.

01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:22.742
This is nothing like
a roller coaster.

01:17:28.164 --> 01:17:29.706
Woo!

01:17:32.125 --> 01:17:34.585
I told you I was gonna
get you out.

01:17:34.587 --> 01:17:36.170
You all right?

01:17:36.172 --> 01:17:40.174
Yeah, yeah, small victories.

01:17:40.176 --> 01:17:43.135
All right, Sadie.
you are my navigation.

01:17:43.137 --> 01:17:44.970
There should be
a compass over near you.

01:17:44.972 --> 01:17:47.598
Can you tell me what
direction we're going in?

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.015
Uh, south.

01:17:49.017 --> 01:17:50.560
South. All right.

01:17:50.562 --> 01:17:53.186
Well, if we're going south,
then east must be...

01:17:53.188 --> 01:17:54.648
- Oh my God!
- Whoa!

01:17:55.984 --> 01:17:58.067
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

01:17:58.069 --> 01:18:00.987
Hey, at least we're not
on the ground, right?

01:18:00.989 --> 01:18:02.195
Yeah.

01:18:02.197 --> 01:18:05.241
What?

01:18:05.243 --> 01:18:07.076
Let me boost you up.

01:18:07.078 --> 01:18:08.743
No, no.
If I fall, then you're not...

01:18:08.745 --> 01:18:10.246
You're not gonna fall.
I got you.

01:18:10.248 --> 01:18:13.000
- Let me boost you up.
- Okay.

01:18:14.209 --> 01:18:17.086
- That's okay. I got you.
- Okay.

01:18:17.088 --> 01:18:18.837
Stand up straight!
Straighten that leg out!

01:18:18.839 --> 01:18:21.258
Straighten this leg out!
Stand up!

01:18:33.062 --> 01:18:34.394
Okay.

01:18:34.396 --> 01:18:37.230
Christine, you're next.
Let's go.

01:18:37.232 --> 01:18:38.440
- Right here, right here.
- Okay.

01:18:38.442 --> 01:18:40.067
Stay with me,
let me pick you up.

01:18:40.069 --> 01:18:42.653
- Okay.
- All right, go!

01:18:42.655 --> 01:18:44.490
Straighten that leg out,
straighten that leg!

01:18:47.785 --> 01:18:50.077
All right, Lockner, you're up.
Let's get you outta here.

01:18:50.079 --> 01:18:52.121
Let's get outta here.

01:18:52.123 --> 01:18:53.875
Ready?
Two, three, go!

01:18:59.463 --> 01:19:01.840
All right, come on up.

01:19:03.217 --> 01:19:04.550
What are you doing?

01:19:04.552 --> 01:19:06.469
Only one of us can
be boosted up.

01:19:06.471 --> 01:19:09.512
Hey, my daughter
might still be in L.A.

01:19:09.514 --> 01:19:11.806
I need to be the one
to save her.

01:19:11.808 --> 01:19:14.644
Your daughter needs you.
Let me stay here.

01:19:14.646 --> 01:19:16.311
- Listen...
- I'm not gonna waste

01:19:16.313 --> 01:19:17.813
any more time arguing.

01:19:17.815 --> 01:19:20.649
I'm gonna boost you up,
throw you the detonator.

01:19:20.651 --> 01:19:23.487
Then you can pull me up, okay?

01:19:27.157 --> 01:19:28.743
Okay.

01:19:31.161 --> 01:19:32.202
- You ready?
- Yeah.

01:19:32.204 --> 01:19:34.747
You ready?

01:19:34.749 --> 01:19:36.668
One, two, three!

01:19:38.002 --> 01:19:39.793
Come on!

01:19:39.795 --> 01:19:41.505
[grunts]

01:19:44.133 --> 01:19:52.223
Okay, Ji!
Toss me the detonator!

01:19:52.225 --> 01:19:54.183
Ji, no!

01:19:54.185 --> 01:20:00.314
Oh...

01:20:00.316 --> 01:20:03.484
What are we supposed
to do now?

01:20:03.486 --> 01:20:06.778
We will wait
and we see

01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:09.739
if the bomb drops
into lava and does the job.

01:20:09.741 --> 01:20:11.324
We can't leave this to chance.

01:20:11.326 --> 01:20:14.619
What the hell
are you doing, Jan?

01:20:14.621 --> 01:20:17.707
I'm doing what I have to do.

01:20:17.709 --> 01:20:19.583
Look, this thing has to
go off at exactly the right time

01:20:19.585 --> 01:20:21.418
or it's all for naught.

01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:24.796
What about Ingrid?

01:20:24.798 --> 01:20:26.967
You're gonna have to meet up
with her on your own.

01:20:28.969 --> 01:20:31.886
Deb, look...

01:20:31.888 --> 01:20:35.515
I've raised her
the last few years alone.

01:20:35.517 --> 01:20:37.728
Now you get your second chance.

01:20:42.191 --> 01:20:45.275
I see why our daughter...

01:20:45.277 --> 01:20:47.569
why she joined the Army.

01:20:47.571 --> 01:20:49.699
Yeah.

01:20:52.035 --> 01:20:53.494
She got it from you.

01:20:59.334 --> 01:21:02.208
Christine...

01:21:02.210 --> 01:21:05.421
I want you to take over
my position at the BEWDC.

01:21:05.423 --> 01:21:08.256
Have confidence
in your abilities, okay?

01:21:08.258 --> 01:21:11.511
I do. You're ready.

01:21:20.771 --> 01:21:26.274
Colonel Lockner, it's been
one hell of a day.

01:21:26.276 --> 01:21:28.402
You know, it's all thanks
to you and your man

01:21:28.404 --> 01:21:30.072
that we're ever here doing this.

01:21:32.407 --> 01:21:33.866
I appreciate it, sir.

01:21:33.868 --> 01:21:36.202
You're a hell of a marine.
Thank you for your service.

01:21:36.204 --> 01:21:37.205
Thank you.

01:21:38.414 --> 01:21:41.248
All right, how much time we got?

01:21:41.250 --> 01:21:42.832
60 seconds.

01:21:42.834 --> 01:21:45.711
You better start running.

01:21:45.713 --> 01:21:50.424
- Dr. Werner?
- Sir?

01:21:50.426 --> 01:21:54.427
You're a good man.

01:21:54.429 --> 01:21:55.807
Thank you, Colonel.

01:21:57.267 --> 01:21:58.390
Wait, wait! Don't...

01:21:58.392 --> 01:21:59.685
Deb?

01:22:02.146 --> 01:22:03.438
I love you.

01:22:19.329 --> 01:22:21.288
Dad!

01:22:21.290 --> 01:22:23.332
Ingrid!

01:22:23.334 --> 01:22:25.333
Dad, climb up quick!

01:22:25.335 --> 01:22:27.713
Ingrid!

01:22:32.427 --> 01:22:33.928
[beeps]

01:22:45.106 --> 01:22:46.900
[laughing]

01:22:50.904 --> 01:22:53.653
Baby girl!
How'd you find us?

01:22:53.655 --> 01:22:56.323
We were going east
like you said.

01:22:56.325 --> 01:22:58.451
When I flew over the tarpits
I saw the downed helicopter,

01:22:58.453 --> 01:23:00.327
so we thought we'd check it out.

01:23:00.329 --> 01:23:02.203
Couldn't have been luckier.

01:23:02.205 --> 01:23:09.045
I'll say! Woo!

01:23:09.719 --> 01:23:10.720
Look!

01:23:18.675 --> 01:23:21.261
Looks like
it's actually working.

01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:26.931
[uplifting music]

01:23:41.096 --> 01:23:43.098
[dramatic music]

01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:48.100
