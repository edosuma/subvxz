00:03.628 --> 00:06.922
Oh, hey, you guys, look.
Ugly Naked Guy's putting stuff in boxes.

00:07.090 --> 00:08.757
Oh.

00:09.884 --> 00:13.595
Huh. I'd say from the looks of it,
our naked buddy is moving.

00:13.847 --> 00:17.683
Ironically, most of the boxes
seem to be labeled "Clothes."

00:18.935 --> 00:21.353
Aw, I'm going to miss that big
old squishy butt.

00:21.604 --> 00:24.773
And we're done
with the chicken fried rice.

00:24.983 --> 00:29.153
Hey. Hey, if he's moving,
maybe I should try to get his place.

00:29.362 --> 00:30.696
- Oh, yeah.
- Good idea.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.948
It would be so cool
to live across from you guys.

00:33.199 --> 00:35.284
Yeah, hey, then we could do
that telephone thing...

00:35.493 --> 00:38.120
...you know, where you have a can,
we have a can...

00:38.329 --> 00:40.539
...and it's connected by a string.

00:41.875 --> 00:45.127
Or we could do
the actual telephone thing.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.762
Oh, my God. I love this apartment.

01:37.013 --> 01:38.305
Isn't it perfect?

01:38.556 --> 01:42.142
I can't believe I never realized
how great it is.

01:42.393 --> 01:45.062
That is because your eye
immediately goes to the big naked man.

01:46.397 --> 01:47.689
It's amazing.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.901
You better hurry up and fill out
an application, or I'll beat you to it.

01:51.152 --> 01:53.028
Oh, heh.

01:56.116 --> 01:59.660
Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm
gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.

02:04.582 --> 02:07.876
Oh, look. There's Monica and Chandler.
Hey!

02:08.044 --> 02:09.752
Hey, you guys! Hey!

02:13.842 --> 02:14.883
Oh!

02:15.802 --> 02:17.761
Aah! Aah!

02:19.305 --> 02:22.683
Aah! Chandler and Monica.
Chandler and Monica.

02:22.934 --> 02:24.309
Oh, my God.

02:24.561 --> 02:27.437
- Chandler and Monica!
- Oh, my God!

02:27.689 --> 02:29.523
Oh, my eyes! My eyes!

02:29.691 --> 02:31.608
- Phoebe. Phoebe.
- Ow!

02:31.776 --> 02:33.026
It's okay. It's okay.

02:33.194 --> 02:35.195
- No, they're doing it!
- I know.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.364
- I know. I know.
- You know?

02:37.615 --> 02:39.825
Yes, I know, and Joey knows,
but Ross doesn't...

02:39.993 --> 02:41.493
...so you have to stop screaming!

02:41.995 --> 02:43.078
Hey, what's going on?

02:46.166 --> 02:47.541
- What?
- Nothing.

02:47.792 --> 02:50.752
Oh, God, we're just so excited
that you might get this apartment.

02:51.588 --> 02:54.631
- Actually, it looks really good.
- Aah! It looks pretty good!

02:55.758 --> 02:56.800
Get in here! Come on!

03:04.809 --> 03:07.186
You mean whenever
Monica and Chandler were, like...

03:07.395 --> 03:10.564
...doing laundry
or going grocery shopping?

03:10.815 --> 03:13.901
All that time Monica spent on the phone
with sad Linda from camp?

03:14.152 --> 03:16.445
Uh-huh.
Doing it, doing it, phone doing it.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.281
I can't believe it.

03:19.532 --> 03:21.950
I mean, I think it's great. For him.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.660
She might be able to do better.

03:25.955 --> 03:28.248
- Hey, you guys.
- Joey, come here. Come here.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.792
Phoebe just found out
about Monica and Chandler.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.545
You mean how they're friends
and nothing more?

03:34.464 --> 03:37.299
No. No, Joey, she knows.

03:37.550 --> 03:40.677
We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment
and saw them doing it through the window.

03:41.512 --> 03:44.806
Actually, we saw them doing it
up against the window.

03:46.059 --> 03:49.978
Okay, so now they know you know,
and they don't know Rachel knows?

03:50.188 --> 03:53.232
Yes, but you know what?
It doesn't matter who knows what.

03:53.441 --> 03:56.610
Now enough of us know
that we could just tell them we know.

03:56.861 --> 03:59.821
Now all the lying and the secrets
will finally be over.

04:00.114 --> 04:03.825
Or we could not tell them we know
and have a little fun of our own.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.037
Well, what do you mean?

04:07.247 --> 04:09.373
You know, every time they say
they're doing laundry...

04:09.540 --> 04:11.166
...we'll give them laundry to do.

04:12.210 --> 04:15.462
- Oh, I would enjoy that.
- No, no, no.

04:15.630 --> 04:18.757
Wait, Rach, you know what would be
even more fun? Telling them.

04:19.676 --> 04:22.761
- Yeah, no, I want to do Phoebe's thing.
- I can't take any...

04:23.012 --> 04:26.098
You don't have to do anything.
Just don't tell them that we know.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.600
No. I can't take any more secrets.

04:28.851 --> 04:32.062
I got your secrets, I got their secrets.
I got secrets of my own, you know.

04:33.898 --> 04:36.733
- You don't have any secrets.
- Oh, yeah?

04:36.901 --> 04:40.529
Well, you don't know about Hugsy,
my bedtime penguin pal.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.702
So, ahem, um...

04:46.869 --> 04:48.245
How are we going to mess with them?

04:49.789 --> 04:52.291
Well, you could use your position
as the roommate.

04:52.542 --> 04:56.128
And then I would use, you know,
the strongest tool at my disposal.

04:56.379 --> 04:58.088
My sexuality.

04:59.257 --> 05:01.967
- Hello, children.
- Hey.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.428
Okay. Watch, learn,
and don't eat my cookie.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.057
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:09.225 --> 05:11.643
Ooh. Wow, that jacket
looks great on you.

05:12.478 --> 05:14.688
- Really?
- Yeah. The material looks so soft.

05:14.897 --> 05:16.690
Oh, hello, Mr. Bicep.

05:19.193 --> 05:20.319
You've been working out?

05:20.570 --> 05:22.571
Well, I try to, you know, squeeze things.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.412
Are you okay?

05:30.621 --> 05:32.497
Well, if you really wanna know...

05:32.665 --> 05:34.541
Oh, I can't tell you this.

05:35.501 --> 05:37.210
Phoebe, it's me,
you can tell me anything.

05:37.462 --> 05:40.630
Well, actually, you're the one person
I can't tell this to.

05:40.882 --> 05:43.425
And the one person I want to the most.

05:46.220 --> 05:47.346
What's going on?

05:48.598 --> 05:51.892
I think it's just, you know,
that I haven't been with a guy in so long...

05:52.060 --> 05:54.478
...and you know how sometimes
you're looking for something...

05:54.645 --> 05:58.565
...and you don't see that it's right there
in front of you, sipping coffee...

05:58.816 --> 06:01.068
Oh, no. Have I said too much?

06:03.071 --> 06:06.782
Well, just something to think about.
I know I will.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.285
Ooh. Ha, ha.

06:20.046 --> 06:22.130
- You are so cute.
- Heh.

06:22.298 --> 06:24.132
How did you get to be so cute?

06:24.300 --> 06:27.135
Well, my grandfather was Swedish.

06:27.345 --> 06:29.971
And my grandmother was actually
a tiny little bunny.

06:31.766 --> 06:34.017
Okay, now you're even cuter.

06:35.144 --> 06:38.230
You know, that is a popular
opinion today, I must say.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.439
What?

06:39.607 --> 06:42.234
The weirdest thing happened
at the coffeehouse.

06:42.485 --> 06:44.069
I think Phoebe was hitting on me.

06:45.363 --> 06:47.030
What are you talking about?

06:47.281 --> 06:49.282
I'm telling you,
I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.

06:53.162 --> 06:55.122
- It's not possible.
- Ow.

06:58.501 --> 07:01.962
I'm sorry, it's just Phoebe's just
always thought you were charming...

07:02.171 --> 07:04.256
...in a sexless kind of way.

07:04.507 --> 07:07.384
Oh, well, you know,
I can't hear that enough.

07:08.719 --> 07:10.929
I'm sorry, I just think
you misunderstood her.

07:11.180 --> 07:13.765
No, I didn't misunderstand, okay?
She was all over me.

07:14.016 --> 07:16.268
She touched my bicep,
for crying out loud.

07:16.978 --> 07:18.019
This bicep?

07:18.521 --> 07:21.148
Well, it's not flexed right now.

07:27.363 --> 07:29.906
Hey, Mon, what are you doing?
Want to come see a movie with us?

07:30.116 --> 07:33.910
Uh, actually, I was going
to do some laundry.

07:36.664 --> 07:40.208
- Chandler, you want to do it with me?
- Sure, I'll do it with you.

07:41.544 --> 07:43.879
Okay, great. Hold on a second.

07:45.715 --> 07:47.966
Unh. Here you go.

07:49.177 --> 07:52.220
You don't mind, do you?
That would really help me out a lot. Thanks.

07:52.680 --> 07:56.057
Ha, ha. You know what?
I don't think I have enough quarters.

07:56.267 --> 07:58.101
Oh, I have quarters.

08:01.772 --> 08:04.691
- Hey.
- Hey, Ross, any word on the apartment yet?

08:04.942 --> 08:08.528
Well, I called over there, and it turns out
Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself.

08:08.779 --> 08:10.572
And he's already had like 100 applicants.

08:11.449 --> 08:12.866
- Oh.
- No, no, I've got the edge.

08:13.075 --> 08:15.827
I know it's not exactly ethical,
but I sent him a bribe...

08:16.078 --> 08:18.205
...to tip the scales in my direction.

08:18.372 --> 08:20.373
Yeah. Check it out,
you can see it from the window.

08:23.586 --> 08:26.838
Oh, is it that pinball machine
with the big bow on it?

08:27.089 --> 08:28.173
No.

08:28.799 --> 08:30.592
That new mountain bike?

08:30.885 --> 08:31.968
No.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.013
Well, what did you send?

08:35.264 --> 08:38.058
A basket of mini muffins.

08:39.184 --> 08:41.602
There's a whole table
of mini muffin baskets.

08:41.770 --> 08:43.522
Which one did you send?

08:43.731 --> 08:45.815
The small one.

08:46.526 --> 08:49.903
What? You actually thought that basket
was gonna get you the apartment?

08:50.154 --> 08:51.446
Well, yeah.

08:51.656 --> 08:56.326
Someone sent us a basket at work once
and people went crazy over those muffins.

08:56.577 --> 08:58.203
It was the best day.

08:58.454 --> 09:00.664
Your work makes me sad.

09:02.166 --> 09:05.210
Oh, man, I want that place so much.

09:05.419 --> 09:08.129
And I was so sure
that was going to work.

09:08.381 --> 09:11.466
There's 12 bucks
I'll never see again.

09:12.343 --> 09:14.761
All right, we'd better go
if we're gonna catch that movie.

09:15.596 --> 09:17.097
- Bye.
- Bye.

09:17.431 --> 09:20.225
Bye, Chandler. I miss you already.

09:25.439 --> 09:28.316
Okay, did you see that?
With the inappropriate, and the pinching?

09:28.568 --> 09:29.651
Actually, I did.

09:29.902 --> 09:32.404
So now do you believe
that she's attracted to me?

09:34.448 --> 09:37.450
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
She knows about us.

09:37.660 --> 09:38.702
Are you serious?

09:38.869 --> 09:41.204
Phoebe knows,
and she's just trying to freak us out.

09:41.789 --> 09:43.790
That's the only explanation for it.

09:47.169 --> 09:51.381
Okay, but what about my pinchable butt
and my bulging biceps?

09:52.008 --> 09:53.133
She knows.

09:58.889 --> 10:00.015
Joey.

10:00.683 --> 10:01.725
Yeah?

10:03.769 --> 10:05.312
Phoebe knows about us.

10:06.188 --> 10:07.272
Well, I didn't tell them.

10:07.732 --> 10:10.358
Them? Who's "them"?

10:10.568 --> 10:14.112
Uh, Phoebe and Joey.

10:16.115 --> 10:17.198
Joey.

10:17.783 --> 10:18.825
And Rachel.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.995
Look, I would have told you,
but they made me promise not to tell.

10:22.163 --> 10:23.747
- Oh, man.
- I'm sorry.

10:23.956 --> 10:25.665
But, hey, it's over now, right?

10:25.916 --> 10:27.751
Because you can tell them
you know they know...

10:27.918 --> 10:30.337
...and I can go back to knowing
absolutely nothing.

10:31.964 --> 10:35.967
- Unless...
- No, not "unless." This must end now.

10:36.344 --> 10:39.846
Oh, man, they think they are so slick
messing with us.

10:40.097 --> 10:43.224
But they don't know
that we know that they know.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.603
- So...
- Ah, yes.

10:46.771 --> 10:49.689
The messers become the messees.

10:53.444 --> 10:55.987
Oh, Ross, honey,
you gotta stop torturing yourself.

10:56.238 --> 10:58.239
Why don't you just find
another apartment?

10:58.491 --> 11:01.326
I've already looked at
like a thousand apartments this month.

11:01.577 --> 11:03.870
None of them even compares
to that one.

11:04.497 --> 11:05.747
You know what you should do?

11:05.956 --> 11:10.126
You should find out what his hobbies are
and then use that to bond with him.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.295
Yeah. Like if I wanted something
from Joey...

11:12.505 --> 11:16.675
...I would strike up a conversation
about, say, um, sandwiches...

11:19.053 --> 11:20.762
...or, uh, my underwear.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.139
I'm listening.

11:24.975 --> 11:26.017
See?

11:26.227 --> 11:28.603
That is a great idea.

11:28.813 --> 11:33.400
And I know Ugly Naked Guy because
we've been watching him for five years.

11:33.609 --> 11:37.362
So that gives me back my edge. Ha, ha.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.031
Let's see now. He had the trampoline.

11:40.241 --> 11:42.534
- But he broke that.
- Well, he had gravity boots.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.036
Yeah, he broke those too.

11:45.454 --> 11:48.415
So he likes to break stuff.

11:50.876 --> 11:54.879
Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben,
but I will figure something out.

11:55.131 --> 11:56.923
Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?

11:57.133 --> 11:59.843
I wouldn't bring that up.
It would probably just bum him out.

12:00.094 --> 12:02.929
Poor cat never saw that big butt coming.

12:06.016 --> 12:07.058
Hello?

12:07.977 --> 12:10.937
Oh, yeah, hey.
Hold on a second, she's right here.

12:11.105 --> 12:12.230
It's Chandler.

12:12.440 --> 12:13.982
Oh.

12:15.901 --> 12:17.402
Hello, you.

12:18.112 --> 12:20.947
Hello, Phoebe,
I've been thinking about you all day.

12:21.365 --> 12:22.949
Huh?

12:24.118 --> 12:27.912
Well, you know that thing you said before?
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.

12:28.330 --> 12:29.497
Really?

12:29.707 --> 12:31.332
Yeah. Listen, Joey won't be here tonight.

12:31.542 --> 12:35.336
Why don't you come over
and I'll let you, uh, feel my bicep.

12:35.629 --> 12:37.630
Or maybe more.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.427
I'll have to get back to you on that.
Okay, bye.

12:44.722 --> 12:48.099
Oh, my God. He wants me to come over
and feel his bicep and more.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.435
- Are you kidding?
- No.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.062
I cannot believe
he would do that to Mon...

13:01.864 --> 13:04.616
Joey? Do they know that we know?

13:05.034 --> 13:07.327
- No.
- Joey?

13:07.495 --> 13:10.038
- They know you know.
- Ooh, I knew it.

13:11.207 --> 13:13.291
Oh, I cannot believe those two.

13:13.501 --> 13:17.253
They thought they could mess with us?
They're trying to mess with us?

13:19.590 --> 13:22.675
They don't know that we know
they know we know.

13:24.428 --> 13:26.304
And, Joey, you can't say anything.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.431
Couldn't if I wanted to.

13:35.397 --> 13:37.357
Good evening, sir.
My name is Ross Geller.

13:37.525 --> 13:39.734
I'm one of the people
who applied for the apartment...

13:39.902 --> 13:44.531
...and I realize that the competition
is fierce, but...

13:46.200 --> 13:51.663
I'm sorry, I can't help but notice
that you're naked and...

13:54.625 --> 13:56.251
I applaud you.

13:56.502 --> 13:59.379
Man, I wish I was naked.

13:59.630 --> 14:03.049
I mean, this looks so great.

14:03.425 --> 14:06.052
That is how God intended it.

14:08.639 --> 14:11.808
- Look at them. They're panicked.
- Oh, yeah, they're totally gonna back down.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.476
Oh, yeah.

14:13.644 --> 14:16.521
All right, if he wants a date,
he's going to get a date.

14:16.772 --> 14:18.356
- I'm going to go in.
- Okay, okay.

14:18.607 --> 14:20.024
Be sexy.

14:21.569 --> 14:22.652
Please.

14:34.164 --> 14:36.374
So, Chandler,
I'd love to come by tonight.

14:40.254 --> 14:41.296
Really?

14:41.505 --> 14:43.631
Oh, absolutely. Should we say around 7?

14:44.717 --> 14:45.967
Yes.

14:48.053 --> 14:52.056
Good. I'm really looking forward
to you and me having sexual intercourse.

14:58.147 --> 15:01.608
Hey, hey, check it out, check it out.
Ugly Naked Guy's got a naked friend.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.240
Oh, yeah.

15:10.701 --> 15:14.037
Oh, my God. That's our friend.

15:14.872 --> 15:18.207
- It's Naked Ross.
- It is Ross!

15:22.463 --> 15:24.130
Showtime.

15:24.632 --> 15:26.174
Okay, Rachel, get me perfume.

15:26.425 --> 15:29.302
And, Joey, can you get me
a bottle of wine and glasses?

15:36.435 --> 15:37.477
All right, it'll be great.

15:37.645 --> 15:40.688
You just make her think you want to
have sex with her and it'll freak her out.

15:42.483 --> 15:44.776
Okay, listen, how far am I gonna
have to go with her?

15:45.027 --> 15:47.028
Relax, she's gonna give in
way before you do.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.280
- How do you know?
- Because you're on my team.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.616
And my team always wins.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.994
At this?

15:55.537 --> 15:58.081
Just go get some. Go.

16:00.084 --> 16:02.335
Okay, honey, now,
I'm gonna try to listen from right here.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.295
- Okay.
- Okay. Oh, wait.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.214
- Good idea.
- Yeah.

16:06.465 --> 16:09.342
- Don't give away the farm.
- Okay.

16:14.723 --> 16:15.765
Phoebe.

16:17.351 --> 16:19.769
- Chandler.
- Come on in.

16:21.271 --> 16:22.355
I was going to.

16:25.401 --> 16:27.694
Um, I brought some wine.
Would you like some?

16:27.903 --> 16:29.153
Sure.

16:37.246 --> 16:40.039
So here we are. Nervous?

16:40.249 --> 16:41.708
Me? No. You?

16:42.001 --> 16:43.918
No. I want this to happen.

16:46.171 --> 16:47.213
So do I.

17:01.228 --> 17:03.271
I'm going to put on some music.

17:03.522 --> 17:05.606
Maybe... Maybe I'll dance for you.

17:25.502 --> 17:27.127
You look good.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.089
Thanks. Heh.

17:30.716 --> 17:34.594
You know, when you say
things like that, it makes me wanna...

17:34.845 --> 17:38.598
...rip that sweater vest right off.

17:40.517 --> 17:42.393
Well, why don't we move this
into the bedroom?

17:42.686 --> 17:45.772
- Really?
- Oh, do you not want to?

17:46.023 --> 17:47.315
No. No.

17:47.524 --> 17:50.651
I just, you know, first,
I wanna take off all my clothes...

17:50.861 --> 17:54.113
...and have you rub lotion on me.

17:55.115 --> 17:57.408
Well, that would be nice.

17:59.787 --> 18:01.704
I'll go get the lotion.

18:05.709 --> 18:08.795
This is totally getting out of hand, okay?
She wants me to put lotion on her.

18:09.004 --> 18:11.714
- She's bluffing.
- Look, she's not backing down.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.591
She went like this...

18:15.886 --> 18:18.721
He's not backing down.
He went to get lotion.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.601
Oh, man, aren't you guys done yet?

18:23.852 --> 18:26.104
I want to sit in my chair.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.398
Joey, look at it this way,
the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler...

18:29.566 --> 18:32.068
...the sooner this is all over
and out in the open.

18:32.236 --> 18:33.611
Ooh, I like that.

18:33.779 --> 18:38.699
Oh, okay. Show him your bra.
He's afraid of bras. Can't work them.

18:39.326 --> 18:41.035
Joey!

18:46.125 --> 18:47.667
Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.

18:48.877 --> 18:50.419
It's not my first time.

18:52.798 --> 18:55.716
You go back out there
and you seduce her till she cracks.

18:55.926 --> 18:57.385
Okay. Give me a second.

18:58.220 --> 19:01.139
- Did you clean up in here?
- Of course.

19:07.062 --> 19:08.312
Oh, you're, uh... You're going?

19:08.730 --> 19:10.731
Um, not without you, lover.

19:15.821 --> 19:18.990
So this is my bra.

19:22.619 --> 19:24.954
It's very, very nice.

19:26.874 --> 19:29.083
Well, come here.

19:29.585 --> 19:32.295
I'm very happy
we're gonna have all the sex.

19:33.964 --> 19:37.341
You should be. I'm very bendy.

19:42.097 --> 19:45.474
- I'm gonna kiss you now.
- Not if I kiss you first.

20:05.746 --> 20:08.664
Well, I guess there's nothing
left for us to do but kiss.

20:09.541 --> 20:11.209
Here it comes.

20:12.461 --> 20:14.003
Our first kiss.

20:23.013 --> 20:25.473
Okay, okay, okay. You win.

20:25.682 --> 20:27.558
- Ha!
- I can't have sex with you.

20:27.768 --> 20:29.852
- And why not?
- Because I'm in love with Monica.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.437
You're... You're what?

20:33.941 --> 20:36.359
Love her. That's right. I love her.

20:36.610 --> 20:39.153
I love her.

20:43.575 --> 20:45.409
I love you, Monica.

20:46.328 --> 20:48.329
I love you too, Chandler.

20:54.002 --> 20:57.380
I just thought you guys were doing it.
I didn't know you were in love.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.926
Dude.

21:03.428 --> 21:05.930
Hats off to Phoebe.
Quite a competitor.

21:07.891 --> 21:10.142
And may I say your breasts
are still showing?

21:10.394 --> 21:11.602
God.

21:12.813 --> 21:14.397
All right. So that's it?

21:14.606 --> 21:16.315
It's over. Everybody knows.

21:16.566 --> 21:18.067
Well, actually, Ross doesn't.

21:18.318 --> 21:20.778
Yes, and we'd appreciate it
if no one told him yet.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.580
A new place for a new Ross.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.874
I'm gonna have you
and all the guys from work over...

21:34.042 --> 21:35.584
...once it's, you know, furnished.

21:35.836 --> 21:37.962
I must say, it's nice to see you
back on your feet.

21:38.213 --> 21:42.174
Well, I am that, uh, and the whole
rage thing is definitely behind me.

21:42.426 --> 21:45.553
I wonder if it's time for you
to rejoin our team at the museum.

21:45.762 --> 21:47.179
Oh, Donald, that would be great.

21:47.389 --> 21:50.725
I am totally ready to come back to work.
I...

21:52.144 --> 21:54.186
What? No.

21:56.773 --> 21:58.858
What are you doing?

21:59.860 --> 22:03.571
Get off my sister!
