Excuse you?

00:52.048 --> 00:54.266
For eating the rest
of my potato bread?

00:54.284 --> 00:56.402
I made that myself
and you know I didn't.

00:56.436 --> 00:57.703
Roger, I...

00:57.737 --> 01:01.207
Wai-wai-wai-wai-wai-
wai-wai-wai-wai-wait-wait.

01:01.241 --> 01:03.509
Wait. Wait. No.

01:03.543 --> 01:05.653
How dare you?!

01:05.773 --> 01:07.306
I've been working my tail off

01:07.426 --> 01:09.728
trying to get my lounge bar
up and running,

01:09.762 --> 01:11.529
and you just sit there all day

01:11.564 --> 01:13.098
breathing through your mannish mouth,

01:13.132 --> 01:15.483
itching your lumpy butt
with your gorilla arms!

01:15.518 --> 01:17.102
What?!
I said I hate you!

01:17.136 --> 01:18.403
In Hayley's defense,

01:18.437 --> 01:21.006
she's been a bit extra mopey
lately because of Jeff.

01:21.040 --> 01:22.334
He got a job on <i>The Deadliest Catch,</i>

01:22.454 --> 01:23.810
and she worries for him.

01:23.930 --> 01:25.877
Oh, please.
<i>The Deadliest Catch?</i>

01:25.911 --> 01:27.746
They're just fishing for crab.

01:27.780 --> 01:29.358
You want to talk about deadly catches,

01:29.478 --> 01:31.033
let's talk about catching AIDS.

01:31.153 --> 01:34.148
Or a baseball thrown by
superstar pitcher Randy Johnson.

01:34.268 --> 01:37.260
What about an AIDS ball
thrown by Randy Johnson?

01:37.378 --> 01:39.713
Oh, I like that.

01:39.747 --> 01:41.998
Hello, Mark Burnett?
This is Roger Smith.

01:42.033 --> 01:44.100
What about a show with Randy Johnson

01:44.135 --> 01:46.736
throwing AIDS-covered baseballs
at people?

01:46.771 --> 01:48.505
Uh-huh.

01:48.539 --> 01:50.273
Uh-huh!

01:50.308 --> 01:52.275
Okay!

01:52.310 --> 01:55.378
It was the wrong Mark Burnett.

01:57.982 --> 02:00.884
Here's my next car, Francine.

02:00.918 --> 02:03.003
The new Hummie
C.O.K. Guzzler.

02:03.037 --> 02:05.539
It runs on carbon,
oxygen and potassium.

02:05.573 --> 02:06.807
Oh, yeah...

02:06.841 --> 02:09.175
the chemical symbol
for potassium is K.

02:09.210 --> 02:11.478
Boy, my chemistry is a little rusty,

02:11.512 --> 02:14.314
but wouldn't it run cleaner
if they added

02:14.348 --> 02:16.716
another carbon molecule
before the potassium?

02:16.751 --> 02:20.787
Then it would guzzle C.O.C.K.

02:20.822 --> 02:23.723
I don't know what
you're talking about.

02:23.758 --> 02:25.959
Oh, wow, look at this sticker price.

02:25.993 --> 02:28.328
Can we even afford this car, Stan?

02:28.362 --> 02:29.529
Of course we can.

02:29.564 --> 02:30.931
The trade-in
value of my SUV

02:30.965 --> 02:33.333
will cover a ton of
the cost. Watch this.

02:33.367 --> 02:34.818
Felix.

02:34.852 --> 02:37.020
Felix, I would like to get 15 grand

02:37.054 --> 02:39.289
for the SUV you sold me a while back

02:39.323 --> 02:41.191
and put it towards
a C.O.K. Guzzler.

02:41.225 --> 02:43.660
Stan, I'd love to get
you started guzzling C.O.K.,

02:43.694 --> 02:45.896
but I'm afraid
the Blue Book for your vehicle

02:45.930 --> 02:47.597
is barely $10,000.

02:47.632 --> 02:49.199
I couldn't do any more than that.

02:54.021 --> 02:56.256
I'll grant you,
sometimes my face smells bad,

02:56.290 --> 02:59.759
but that doesn't mean my head's
firmly planted in my ass, Felix.

02:59.794 --> 03:01.328
I can't go over $10,000.

03:03.364 --> 03:05.031
I know this car can get fifteen,

03:05.066 --> 03:06.967
and I'm not settling for a penny less.

03:07.001 --> 03:08.301
I'll just sell it myself.

03:08.336 --> 03:10.237
Oh, no, Stan, really?

03:10.271 --> 03:11.338
Are you sure?

03:11.372 --> 03:12.606
Yes, I'm sure.

03:13.641 --> 03:16.009
Wh-What is,
what is that smell?

03:16.043 --> 03:20.313
I think it's your face.

03:22.850 --> 03:26.253
This place is just what
Langley Falls needs.

03:26.287 --> 03:28.722
A chic lounge environment
for young professionals.

03:28.756 --> 03:30.390
If they need it so much,

03:30.424 --> 03:32.726
how come there's nobody here?

03:32.760 --> 03:36.263
I'm gonna eat you one day.

03:40.268 --> 03:42.802
My bar is dead.
It doesn't make sense.

03:42.837 --> 03:45.055
I co-wrote <i>City Slickers</i>
with Babaloo Mandel

03:45.089 --> 03:46.590
but I can't do this?

03:47.692 --> 03:50.143

04:37.425 --> 04:39.492
I'll leave, after I tell you this:

04:39.527 --> 04:42.228
You just got a job
singing in my lounge.

04:42.263 --> 04:43.697
Really?
Shut up.

04:43.731 --> 04:45.932
I want you there tomorrow night
wearing something amazing.

04:45.967 --> 04:47.400
Oh, and don't worry about the camera.

04:47.435 --> 04:48.668
It's made of chocolate.

04:48.703 --> 04:50.186
Ow! Oh, that's right,

04:50.221 --> 04:53.073
it's the toilet camera
that's chocolate.

04:58.279 --> 05:01.548
Oh, boy, that's on film.

05:08.239 --> 05:09.806
Francine, I just posted an ad

05:09.840 --> 05:12.075
for my SUV on Craigslist.

05:12.109 --> 05:13.843
Ooh, any responses yet?

05:13.878 --> 05:15.178
Let's see here.

05:15.212 --> 05:17.313
Oh, looks like I've got three.

05:17.348 --> 05:19.983
And they're all for anonymous sex.

05:20.017 --> 05:23.136
Maybe it's because I wrote,
"Smooth ride, oversized trunk,

05:23.170 --> 05:24.771
lubed and ready to go."

05:24.805 --> 05:28.324
Shouldn't have had that
wine before I wrote this.

05:32.863 --> 05:34.931
Good, you're here and
you don't look terrible.

05:34.965 --> 05:36.032
Miracle.

05:36.067 --> 05:37.884
I'm actually looking forward to this.

05:37.918 --> 05:41.554
This is just the distraction
I need while Jeff is at sea.

05:41.605 --> 05:44.257
And what's my distraction
from your boring stories?

Maybe you should
buy a new bra with it.

06:53.344 --> 06:55.845
When you shimmy, your boobs
are kind of all over the place.

06:55.880 --> 06:57.347
You're looking at my boobs?

06:57.381 --> 06:58.481
What? No.

06:58.516 --> 07:00.266
If anything, I was
looking at you teats

07:00.301 --> 07:02.435
because I think of you as my cash cow.

07:02.470 --> 07:05.472
I just want to milk ya!
Milky, milky, milky!

07:05.523 --> 07:07.957
Roger, quit!
Okay, sensitive.

07:07.992 --> 07:10.493
Boy, you smell bad today.
Did you just fart?

07:10.528 --> 07:12.195
You know I didn't fart, Roger.

07:12.229 --> 07:14.097
It smells like you did.

07:14.131 --> 07:16.866
Smells like girl fart in here.

07:16.901 --> 07:18.401
Pumpkin bread.

07:18.435 --> 07:21.371
Right. Anyway,
thanks for the money.

07:21.405 --> 07:23.039
Nah, nah, nah money.

07:23.073 --> 07:25.375
So stupid.

07:25.409 --> 07:27.210
Uh, what was that?

07:27.244 --> 07:29.078
What? I'm always mean to Haley.

07:29.113 --> 07:30.797
Yeah, but usually
you're genuinely mean.

07:30.831 --> 07:33.716
This time you were playfully
mean, like you're teasing her.

07:33.751 --> 07:35.451
So what?
So what?

07:35.486 --> 07:36.920
So everything!

07:36.954 --> 07:38.321
When a boy teases a girl,

07:38.355 --> 07:40.356
it's a sign he has a crush on her.

07:40.391 --> 07:42.025
The same way that hot dogs for dinner

07:42.059 --> 07:43.993
is a sign that Mom's
overwhelmed by her period.

07:44.028 --> 07:45.228
Are you kidding me?!

07:45.262 --> 07:47.163
You think I have a crush on Haley?!

07:50.034 --> 07:51.267
Now I do!

07:51.302 --> 07:54.404
No way! She's a piece
of crap, Steve. I swear!

07:54.438 --> 07:56.673
Yeah, she is kind of a piece of crap.

07:56.707 --> 07:58.675
Don't you talk about her that way.

07:58.709 --> 08:00.176
Trapped ya!

08:00.211 --> 08:02.545
Oh, boy.

08:07.595 --> 08:09.195
I can't believe
I'm in love with Haley.

08:09.229 --> 08:11.064
I don't want to be in love with her,

08:11.098 --> 08:12.498
she's your sister, she's married,

08:12.533 --> 08:13.499
she's... Haley.

08:13.534 --> 08:15.201
Relax. First of all,

08:15.235 --> 08:17.770
you're not in love,
you just have a crush.

08:17.805 --> 08:19.305
Happens to me all the time.

08:19.340 --> 08:21.074
The good news is, it'll pass.

08:21.108 --> 08:23.643
In the mean time,
you just need a distraction.

08:23.677 --> 08:24.677
Like-like a hobby.

08:24.712 --> 08:26.012
Maybe turn to exercise.

08:26.046 --> 08:28.464
Focus on building core strength.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.568
Those look angry.

08:32.602 --> 08:34.988
Okay, just a crush;
I'll get over this.

08:35.022 --> 08:36.456
What's a good hobby?

08:36.490 --> 08:39.859
Got a bunch of string
that's not doing anything.

08:43.212 --> 08:45.214
Ah!

08:49.336 --> 08:50.853
Hey, you.

08:50.888 --> 08:52.972
Uh, hey, <i>you.</i>

08:53.006 --> 08:55.308
"Hey, me!"
You flipped it on me.

08:59.179 --> 09:00.863
Look, I just wanted to say thanks

09:00.898 --> 09:02.548
for letting me sing at your bar.

09:04.485 --> 09:06.452
I mean, I'm no Christina Aguilera,

09:06.487 --> 09:08.554
but, you know, when I'm up there,

09:08.589 --> 09:11.057
I really feel like a star.

09:11.091 --> 09:12.959
Ha! What're,
what are you doing?

09:12.993 --> 09:15.378
I-I don't know
what you're doing.

09:15.412 --> 09:17.347
I don't--
You're so weird, God!

09:21.719 --> 09:23.903
This isn't passing;
it's getting worse.

09:23.937 --> 09:26.339
Time for a trip to the dentist.

09:32.346 --> 09:34.063
Crap!

09:34.098 --> 09:36.149
I must've grabbed the helium tank!

09:39.319 --> 09:40.753
Hi, I'm here about the SUV.

09:40.788 --> 09:42.105
Of course you are.

09:42.156 --> 09:43.823
What's you name, pilgrim?
Darrin.

09:43.857 --> 09:45.441
Darrin! You married, Darrin?

09:45.476 --> 09:47.110
Divorced.
Bitches, right?

09:47.144 --> 09:48.861
As you can see, Darrin,
she's fully loaded.

09:48.895 --> 09:50.179
She's got a turn-key
ignition system.

09:50.214 --> 09:51.914
Just put the key in the key hole,

09:51.949 --> 09:53.449
turn it a bit to the right,

09:53.484 --> 09:55.852
and she'll start right up
in, like, a second.

09:55.886 --> 09:57.754
What do you say?
How's 15K sound?

09:57.788 --> 09:59.155
15K, ooh...

09:59.189 --> 10:01.557
How about 10K? The divorce
was kind of hard on me,

10:01.592 --> 10:02.859
you know what I mean?

10:02.893 --> 10:04.060
We're not friends here, Darrin.

10:04.094 --> 10:05.395
Bitches, remember?

10:05.429 --> 10:07.246
You're a bitch, Darrin.
Get off my property.

10:15.389 --> 10:18.357
What are you?!

10:21.211 --> 10:22.762
Jeff, get over here

10:22.796 --> 10:24.930
and help me pull in these traps!

10:24.948 --> 10:27.450
You said it wasn't
gonna to rain today!

10:27.484 --> 10:29.018
I can't watch anymore of this.

10:29.053 --> 10:30.787
Aah, it makes me too nervous.

10:33.440 --> 10:35.224
Sorry.
Oh, sorry.

10:35.259 --> 10:36.325
Okay.
Whoops.

10:36.360 --> 10:38.027
Oh, no, we did it again!

10:38.062 --> 10:40.663
I'm gonna go this way. No...
That one was my fault.

10:40.697 --> 10:42.815
Y-You just stand still.

10:42.850 --> 10:44.901
N-No...
Okay, this is a mess.

10:44.935 --> 10:46.919
Okay, all right, let's both go left.

10:46.954 --> 10:48.304
No...
It's still happening!

10:48.338 --> 10:49.839
That's your right!
This is ridiculous.

10:49.873 --> 10:50.907
Oh, my God!

10:50.941 --> 10:52.592
Roger, get out of the way!

10:52.626 --> 10:54.577
Oh, I splooged a little.

10:58.415 --> 11:00.149
God, I'm shaking.

11:00.184 --> 11:01.184
What's wrong with you, man?

11:01.218 --> 11:02.819
I think I love Hayley.

11:02.853 --> 11:04.320
Dude, seriously?

11:04.354 --> 11:07.507
With Francine "Cans McGee"
struttin' around this place?

11:07.541 --> 11:10.660
Every time I see her,
I turn into a complete idiot.

11:10.694 --> 11:13.663
These feelings are too
intense; this has to stop!

11:13.697 --> 11:15.364
Easy, King Cobra.

11:15.399 --> 11:18.534
Look, why don't you just remove
yourself from her presence?

11:18.569 --> 11:19.702
How am I supposed to do that?

11:19.736 --> 11:21.571
She sings in my club every night!

11:21.605 --> 11:23.539
Hmm... I got it.

11:23.574 --> 11:25.741
I'll fire her for you.

11:25.776 --> 11:27.877
I'll do it like
an American businessman.

11:27.911 --> 11:29.112
"I'm sorry, ma'am.

11:29.146 --> 11:30.963
"The economy has taken a turn,

11:30.998 --> 11:32.732
"and we've been forced to downsize.

11:32.766 --> 11:34.233
I'm gonna need your key card."

11:34.268 --> 11:35.902
Don't do characters.

11:35.936 --> 11:36.969
I do characters.

11:37.004 --> 11:38.638
Don't do characters.

11:38.672 --> 11:39.839
Hup! Hup!

11:39.857 --> 11:40.940
Whoop!

11:40.974 --> 11:43.092
Hup!
Whoop! Hup! Hup!

11:43.127 --> 11:44.560
What the hell, Klaus?

11:44.595 --> 11:45.595
Who are they?

11:45.629 --> 11:47.430
They are the Red-Man Group.

11:47.464 --> 11:49.132
They're your replacement.

11:49.166 --> 11:51.134
Roger says you're
no longer welcome here.

11:51.168 --> 11:54.170
What? What do
you mean? Roger!

11:54.204 --> 11:56.272
Roger, I need to talk to you.

11:56.306 --> 11:57.340
Hit the bricks, toots.

11:57.374 --> 11:58.574
You got your walking papers.

11:58.609 --> 11:59.675
What did I do?

11:59.710 --> 12:00.710
I said beat it!

12:00.744 --> 12:02.411
You owe me an explanation.

12:02.446 --> 12:03.913
I said beat it!

12:03.947 --> 12:05.948
You're such a jerk, Roger.

12:05.983 --> 12:07.917
Ugh!

12:07.951 --> 12:09.952
So, how much is this tape recorder?

12:09.987 --> 12:11.420
$17.99.

12:11.455 --> 12:13.356
That's great. I'm
definitely gonna buy one.

12:13.390 --> 12:15.558
Could you check in the back
and see if you have it in red?

12:15.592 --> 12:16.993
Sir, you can't
put that in your pocket.

12:17.027 --> 12:18.394
Hee'yah!

12:18.428 --> 12:20.396
Oh! You broke my nose!

12:20.430 --> 12:23.833
Security!

12:23.867 --> 12:26.869
Oh, God,
where did I park the car?

12:28.906 --> 12:31.824
See, what did I tell you about
the leg room in the back seat?

12:31.859 --> 12:33.359
Very roomy.

12:33.393 --> 12:35.561
And it's an extremely safe
first car for your daughter.

12:35.579 --> 12:36.996
You're a good dad.
Your dad's a good dad.

12:37.030 --> 12:38.164
Hey, check it out.

12:38.198 --> 12:39.916
This thing can stop
on a dime. Think fast!

12:41.602 --> 12:43.135
Oh...

12:54.231 --> 12:56.165
That's it.

12:56.200 --> 12:57.800
Looks like a good one.

12:57.834 --> 12:59.969
You're doing just fine.

13:00.003 --> 13:01.237
Uh, what is this?

13:01.271 --> 13:03.172
It's Hayley on the toilet cam.

13:03.207 --> 13:05.608
She's having a private moment,
and I'm sharing it with her.

13:05.642 --> 13:07.543
Okay, this is getting out of hand.

13:07.578 --> 13:09.545
Avoiding Hayley clearly isn't working.

13:09.580 --> 13:10.646
You should just talk to her.

13:10.681 --> 13:12.415
Get all this out in the open.

13:12.449 --> 13:13.449
I can't do that!

13:13.483 --> 13:15.518
Being emotionally honest
makes me vomit!

13:15.552 --> 13:16.586
Sure you can.

13:16.620 --> 13:18.137
Just take it slow.

13:18.171 --> 13:20.573
Here, here, try it on me,
pretend I'm Hayley.

13:20.607 --> 13:21.557
Okay.

13:21.592 --> 13:23.359
Hayley, I'm in love with...

13:26.396 --> 13:28.631
I'm in love with you, and I
can't stop thinking about...

13:34.171 --> 13:35.605
No food in my belly.

13:35.639 --> 13:38.140
Let me try again. Hayley,
you're such an angel...

13:39.243 --> 13:40.276
Oh, that's great, Steve.

13:40.310 --> 13:41.510
You owe me an underwear.

13:41.545 --> 13:43.312
Look, you can't keep avoiding her.

13:43.347 --> 13:44.680
You live in the same house.

13:44.715 --> 13:46.949
You're her notary public
for God's sake.

13:46.984 --> 13:48.351
I'm not licensed.

13:48.385 --> 13:50.152
She knows that.

13:50.187 --> 13:51.787
Look, just talk to her.

13:51.822 --> 13:53.789
Trust me, you guys
will have a big laugh

13:53.824 --> 13:56.225
about it, and all the
awkwardness will go away.

13:56.260 --> 13:57.293
What if I can't do it?

13:57.327 --> 13:58.527
What if I freak out?

13:58.562 --> 13:59.562
You'll be fine.

13:59.596 --> 14:00.563
I promise.

14:00.597 --> 14:01.564
Okay, Steve.

14:01.598 --> 14:02.682
I'm gonna trust you.

14:02.716 --> 14:04.567
And I'm serious about the underwear.

14:04.601 --> 14:06.285
I want an exact replacement.

14:06.320 --> 14:07.853
Underoos, extra-large.

14:07.888 --> 14:09.889
Skid-marked to hell.

14:13.527 --> 14:15.294
Hello? Was that a knock?

14:15.329 --> 14:17.997
It's me, Roger.

14:25.272 --> 14:28.741
Hayley, I've got something
I need to tell you.

14:28.775 --> 14:30.810
What is it, Roger, you gonna
fire me again?

14:30.844 --> 14:33.612
No, unh, unh, I'm not,

14:33.647 --> 14:37.650
unh, you don't understand, unh.

14:37.684 --> 14:39.552
Roger, what is going on with you?

14:39.586 --> 14:41.654
Well, uh, it's just...

14:41.688 --> 14:44.190
Hayley, I'm in love with you!

14:44.224 --> 14:47.226
What? O... Oh, oh.

14:47.260 --> 14:49.829
That's why
you've been acting so weird.

14:49.863 --> 14:51.497
Oh, Roger.

14:51.531 --> 14:53.565
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:53.685 --> 14:54.930
So...

14:55.050 --> 14:58.037
So? Oh, oh...

14:58.071 --> 15:00.272
Oh, no, Roger, we're friends.

15:00.307 --> 15:03.275
I mean, I'm flattered,
but you know I'm married.

15:03.310 --> 15:05.261
Yes, yes, yeah.

15:05.295 --> 15:07.096
I did. I did know that.

15:07.130 --> 15:10.983
I'm sorry.
Oh, hey, never apologize for how you feel.

15:11.018 --> 15:12.952
That's all we got, right?

15:12.986 --> 15:15.171
All right, well, fantastic, then.

15:18.241 --> 15:21.527
Roger, what are you-- no!

15:21.561 --> 15:23.863
Steve, I freaked out!

15:28.632 --> 15:30.283
Urgent medical jargon, stat!

15:30.317 --> 15:31.501
Roger, what the hell
were you thinking?!

15:31.535 --> 15:32.635
I don't know!

15:32.653 --> 15:34.303
I was overwhelmed with emotion!

15:34.321 --> 15:35.972
So you shot me?!

15:35.990 --> 15:38.441
I'm sorry!
Something snapped in me.

15:38.475 --> 15:41.160
I opened up my soul to you,
and when you rejected me,

15:41.195 --> 15:43.379
I-I guess I couldn't handle it.

15:45.416 --> 15:49.269
I could totally see her bra
through the gunshot hole.

15:55.309 --> 15:57.143
Hey, sleepyhead.

15:57.177 --> 15:58.478
Why would they let you in here?

15:58.512 --> 16:00.446
I gave birth to my daughters here.

16:00.481 --> 16:01.881
Oh, I got you this.

16:01.916 --> 16:03.917
I feel really bad about what I did.

16:03.951 --> 16:07.086
I haven't slept in seven
hours, not counting naps.

16:07.121 --> 16:09.789
Anyway, I hope this gift
can at least begin

16:09.823 --> 16:11.124
to make up for what I've done.

16:11.158 --> 16:13.493
I don't want your stupid gift.

16:13.527 --> 16:14.827
I'll open it for you.

16:16.363 --> 16:18.631
It's Christina Aguilera's larynx!

16:18.666 --> 16:20.016
Ugh! Get it away from me!

16:20.050 --> 16:21.451
What's going on?

16:21.485 --> 16:22.518
Back to sleep.

16:22.553 --> 16:23.820
Remember how you said

16:23.854 --> 16:26.089
you wished you could sing
like Christina Aguilera?

16:26.123 --> 16:27.457
Well, now you can!

16:36.500 --> 16:39.502
Anyway, it's a really good
gift because I love you.

16:39.536 --> 16:40.870
This isn't love, Roger.

16:40.904 --> 16:41.871
Yuh-huh!

16:41.905 --> 16:43.306
You tried to kill me.

16:43.340 --> 16:45.341
People who are in love don't do that.

16:45.376 --> 16:47.043
They, they want to
spend time together.

16:47.077 --> 16:49.379
They want to be as close
to each other as possible.

16:49.413 --> 16:52.782
Let's do that! We're
gonna do your thing!

16:52.816 --> 16:54.050
Oh, no.

16:54.084 --> 16:56.719
Ro-Roger, whatever
you're thinking there,

16:56.754 --> 16:58.154
whatever you're doing,
please just don't...

17:02.743 --> 17:04.477
Morning, snowflake.

17:04.511 --> 17:05.877
What the hell are you doing, Roger?

17:05.913 --> 17:07.012
You're scaring me.

17:07.047 --> 17:08.247
No-no-no, no-no-no,
it's good.

17:08.281 --> 17:09.464
It's good.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.567
I just want to be as
close to you as possible.

17:11.602 --> 17:14.704
Like John and Yoko.

17:14.738 --> 17:16.873
You're Yoko.

17:16.906 --> 17:19.776
Can't get
close enough.

17:19.810 --> 17:22.545
Don't you hate that
we're two separate people?

17:22.579 --> 17:23.880
Roger, take me home!

17:23.914 --> 17:27.050
Aah, just want to burrow
into you like a love tick.

17:27.084 --> 17:31.421
I want us to be one person:
two hearts inside one skin.

17:31.455 --> 17:33.339
That's it!
Oh, no.

17:33.374 --> 17:34.841
Roger, whatever you're thinking...

17:34.875 --> 17:38.227
I'm gonna cut off your skin
and drape it all over my body!

17:38.262 --> 17:39.545
Help...!

17:39.580 --> 17:41.731
Ooh, I'm gonna go get my tools!

17:41.765 --> 17:43.783
Right after I do a flip.

17:45.302 --> 17:46.669
No, I'm not gonna do it.

17:46.704 --> 17:49.305
I'm actually gonna get off
the bed really carefully.

17:52.793 --> 17:55.762
Oh, my God, I did the flip!

17:55.796 --> 17:57.764
You didn't see me, but I did it!

17:57.798 --> 18:00.066
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,

18:00.100 --> 18:02.502
welcome to the greatest
showroom on Earth!

18:02.536 --> 18:04.837
We got thrills...

18:04.872 --> 18:06.039
we got chills...

18:07.441 --> 18:09.575
...and we got a like-new
set of wheels!

18:12.429 --> 18:14.464
Stan, Hayley's been shot!

18:14.498 --> 18:16.232
So what? She shot
me before.

18:16.266 --> 18:17.299
I've shot you a couple times.

18:17.317 --> 18:18.351
Everybody shoots everybody.

18:18.402 --> 18:20.787
It's how we communicate
in this family.

18:20.821 --> 18:23.523
All right, I'll tell her
you asked about her.

18:23.557 --> 18:24.757
You tell her whatever you want,

18:24.792 --> 18:26.693
but that's not how it went down.

18:26.727 --> 18:27.960
What's going on here?!

18:27.995 --> 18:29.479
Well, I guess it's time

18:29.513 --> 18:32.448
to let the cat out of the bag.

18:37.171 --> 18:38.871
He's getting too close!

18:38.922 --> 18:41.324
The SUV's not for you, Lion!

18:41.358 --> 18:43.659
This fine American automobile
is gonna go

18:43.694 --> 18:45.762
to one of these lucky individuals.

18:45.796 --> 18:48.097
Shall we start the bidding at 15,000?

18:48.132 --> 18:49.298
Sir!
Excuse me! Hey, look!

18:49.332 --> 18:50.433
Whoa, started too low.

18:50.467 --> 18:51.434
Do I hear 20?

18:51.468 --> 18:52.468
Hey, hey, buddy!

18:52.502 --> 18:53.553
We've got 20 right here.

18:53.604 --> 18:54.570
What about 25?

18:54.605 --> 18:55.671
Your lion!

18:55.706 --> 18:57.373
I'm not lyin'! Do I hear 30?!

18:57.408 --> 18:58.941
Oh, my God.
Hel-l-lp!

18:58.976 --> 19:00.643
You're doing great!
Do I hear 40?!

19:00.677 --> 19:01.644
Hello!
Hey!

19:01.678 --> 19:02.729
40, 45, 50.

19:02.763 --> 19:04.564
Do I hear 60?
Hey, sir.

19:29.239 --> 19:32.275
This just got real, didn't
it, seeing all these tools?

19:33.310 --> 19:34.277
Hayley!

19:34.311 --> 19:35.511
Oh, this guy?

19:35.546 --> 19:37.880
Jeff, oh, thank God!

19:37.915 --> 19:39.282
Jeff, I'm doing something.

19:39.316 --> 19:40.416
How did you find us?

19:40.451 --> 19:41.717
Well, I quit <i>Deadliest Catch</i>

19:41.752 --> 19:44.020
when Francine called and
said you shot Hayley.

19:44.054 --> 19:46.389
When I got home,
I saw you stealing my tools,

19:46.423 --> 19:48.057
so I followed you here.

19:48.091 --> 19:49.759
Stalker.

19:49.793 --> 19:52.695
He's crazy, Jeff,
he's trying to take my skin.

19:52.729 --> 19:54.597
Dude, please don't skin my wife.

19:54.631 --> 19:55.665
I love her.

19:55.699 --> 19:56.999
But I love her, too.

19:57.034 --> 19:58.201
No, you don't.

19:58.235 --> 19:59.202
You're obsessed with me.

19:59.236 --> 20:00.203
There's a difference.

20:00.237 --> 20:01.204
What?

20:01.238 --> 20:03.473
Roger, love is mutual,

20:03.507 --> 20:05.074
and that's what Jeff and I have.

20:05.108 --> 20:06.909
I'm sorry, but no matter what you do,

20:06.944 --> 20:09.078
Jeff is the only one for me.

20:10.714 --> 20:13.816
Oh, my God, it's finally clear now.

20:13.851 --> 20:17.053
You don't want me, you want Jeff,

20:17.087 --> 20:19.138
and no matter how much I love you,

20:19.173 --> 20:21.140
it won't matter because I'm not him.

20:21.175 --> 20:23.309
Right, yes, you get it.

20:23.343 --> 20:24.877
Hayley, I'm so sorry.

20:26.446 --> 20:30.500
I can't, I can't believe I was
going to take your skin off.

20:31.785 --> 20:34.520
This is the skin for me.

20:36.073 --> 20:37.690
Hey, babe, let's go try

20:37.724 --> 20:41.010
that weird skiing that's like this.

20:41.044 --> 20:43.045
Remind me to never take this hat off.

20:43.080 --> 20:45.565
I got everything held together
up there with a chip clip.

20:46.600 --> 20:48.100
Great, you hate it.

20:48.135 --> 20:49.836
That's all right, I'm over you anyway.

20:49.870 --> 20:51.254
Steve was right--
it was just a crush.

20:51.288 --> 20:54.207
Hey, Jeff, good news,
you're getting your skin back.

20:57.244 --> 20:58.711
Gross.

21:00.843 --> 21:11.267
