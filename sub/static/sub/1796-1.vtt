00:33.840 --> 00:37.287
3 YEARS AGO 

00:49.000 --> 00:52.322
BILL WILLIAMSON MASSACRED HIS HOMETOWN OF TENDERVILLE 

00:52.480 --> 00:56.724
USING AUTOMATIC WEAPONS AND A CACHE OF MASSIVE 
EXPLOSIVES HE CLAIMED OVER A HUNDRED VICTIMS. 

01:05.720 --> 01:09.691
IT HAS BEEN RECORED AS THE DEADLIEST 
KILLING SPREE IN THE U.S. HISTORY. 

01:23.840 --> 01:27.367
BILL DISAPPEARED IN THE SAME 
EVENING OF THE MASSACRE, 

01:28.440 --> 01:31.047
2 YEARS LATER A VIDEO APPEARED ONLINE 

01:32.760 --> 01:36.525
It's ahh..
It's sad downward spiral, 

01:37.000 --> 01:39.207
To the end of all times. 

01:39.360 --> 01:44.605
And ahh..There's no chance that we can survive.

01:44.760 --> 01:46.649
I mean ....

01:47.000 --> 01:51.244
70 million people every year are brought into this Earth. 

01:51.400 --> 01:54.324
What have they doing? 
Sucking up all our resources. 

01:54.480 --> 01:57.802
There's too many people, 
So What do we do?   

01:57.960 --> 02:00.122
Just Keep them around? 

02:00.280 --> 02:03.363
Lets kill them! Lets get rid of them! 

02:03.560 --> 02:06.643
Good! Thank you! Thanks for ahh....
Thanks for coming out. 

02:06.960 --> 02:09.883
THE VIDEO HAS REACHED OVER FIVE MILLION 
VIEWS. BILL HAS BECOME AN INTERNET SENSATION OF 

02:10.039 --> 02:14.329
MYSTHIC  STATUS AMONG HATE GROUPS AND  
POLITICAL EXTREMIST AROUND THE WORLD.

02:14.640 --> 02:17.120
Why not? 
Well that's my point, that's what I want to

02:17.320 --> 02:20.290
Let's just clean the world, 

02:20.440 --> 02:25.287
So maybe the rest of us can sustain
a little bead of life.

02:27.680 --> 02:31.526
So maybe that's what I'll do that in future, 

02:31.680 --> 02:35.605
I'll.. I'll help you out.
I will help you out. 

02:35.800 --> 02:38.007
And I will cleanst..  

02:40.040 --> 02:44.090
DESPITE ONGOING MANHUNT ACROSS MULTIPLE STATES 
AUTHORITHIES HAVE DETECTED NO SIGN OF HIM EVER SINCE.

02:44.240 --> 02:48.086
- 

03:45.280 --> 03:49.285
This my dear viewers, 
is maybe a once in a lifetime opportunity 

03:49.440 --> 03:52.967
for a few minutes 
uncensored material to see, 

03:53.120 --> 03:55.361
I have something important to say, 

03:55.680 --> 04:00.208
I had to kill and will even 
dying to be on TV, 

04:23.720 --> 04:25.529
I call you the facts, 

04:25.680 --> 04:29.651
The U,S, government 
is funded by the rich, 

04:29.800 --> 04:33.407
It keeps the people 
on the intellectual level of children, 

04:37.800 --> 04:42.328
It ensures that people 
are concerned with making money, 

04:42.480 --> 04:45.689
That they are to family 
House and lawn care, 

04:45.840 --> 04:48.810
People should think 
that they are free, 

04:48.960 --> 04:51.201
and can do whatever they want, 

04:51.560 --> 04:57.602
Free press, television, Hollywood movies, 
Schools, universities, religions ,,, 

04:59.440 --> 05:02.284
They falsely suggesting that anything is possible, 

05:04.720 --> 05:07.371
I tell you what that is:

05:07.680 --> 05:11.605
a dictatorship of the brainwashing 
in the guise of democracy, 

07:23.680 --> 07:27.844
You mean but that he was at home, 
I can not see anyone, 

07:28.000 --> 07:30.526
Hello? Mr Johnson! 

07:31.160 --> 07:33.401
Let us take the front door, 

07:48.640 --> 07:51.007
let 
in an hour come again, 

09:31.840 --> 09:34.081
- Do you want a cigarette? 
- Yes, 

09:41.240 --> 09:44.050
I want you ask you something, 

09:45.160 --> 09:47.766
Why do not you rob a bank? 

09:49.560 --> 09:51.528
Or people? 

09:52.480 --> 09:54.289
- Got it, 
- Here, 

09:54.600 --> 09:55.965
There it is, Hurry up, 

09:59.720 --> 10:02.849
In prison there must be better 
than on the road, 

10:03.400 --> 10:05.607
That's not our thing, 

10:05.760 --> 10:07.842
Here we are at least free, 

10:08.200 --> 10:10.089
Free? You want to be free? 

10:11.000 --> 10:12.684
What is this freedom? 

10:13.040 --> 10:16.203
You can not even 
Buy a bus ticket, right? 

10:16.360 --> 10:18.601
Bus tickets cost money, or '? 

10:19.560 --> 10:24.646
In prison there is at least a while, 
Much warmer than on the road, or '? 

10:25.320 --> 10:28.085
Money is all that you need, or '? 

10:29.560 --> 10:31.961
That's right, Money is everything, 

10:32.280 --> 10:36.683
- What should I do with money in prison? 
- You have nothing to spend in jail, 

10:37.640 --> 10:40.530
Taxpayers 
pay for you in jail, 

10:40.680 --> 10:44.401
You pay your food, 
your water, your heating ,,, 

10:45.840 --> 10:50.926
In prison it's you warmer than if 
you sit on your lazy asses, 

10:53.520 --> 10:57.047
Why do not you get 
your ass up and take what? 

10:59.080 --> 11:04.962
Do you still a favor and 
robs someone from, will criminals, 

11:10.280 --> 11:12.169
It pays off, 

11:13.480 --> 11:17.121
Wait until I make my introduction, 
and then ,,, 

11:17.320 --> 11:19.402
Wiki, which is ,,, 

11:20.600 --> 11:22.682
Do you know what I mean? Andy? 

11:23.000 --> 11:25.287
The page starts missing, 

11:25.960 --> 11:29.487
The ones I have given you, 
Andy, that's exactly what I'm talking about, 

11:29.800 --> 11:31.802
Then I take the damned, 

11:32.760 --> 11:36.287
I just need people 
which are on the ball, 

11:37.000 --> 11:39.367
Are we so far? 
Andy, we are so far? 

12:04.960 --> 12:07.201
As we already spoke of it, 

12:08.480 --> 12:13.520
I'm going from factual information 
Julian Assange's writing aloud, 

12:13.680 --> 12:15.762
Since it is 40 pages long, 

12:15.960 --> 12:21.410
I will focus on the key messages 
the minutes limit, 

12:21.760 --> 12:27.767
"The whole of our conceptions 
and our knowledge of the world 

12:27.920 --> 12:31.527
set the limits 
our rational action firmly, 

12:31.840 --> 12:35.049
<i> course 
we all act also irrational, </ i> </i>

12:35.360 --> 12:37.727
<i> Companies act irrationally, </ i> </i>

12:38.040 --> 12:40.611
<i> irrational / advises 
can not tackle rational, </ i> </i>

12:41.120 --> 12:46.286
<i> Our ability as rational beings 
rational to act and react, </ i> </i>

12:46.600 --> 12:50.366
is our knowledge 
narrowed over the world, 

12:50.520 --> 12:53.763
For a possible 
human rational action 

12:53.920 --> 12:57.891
we need maximum input 
for our decision-making processes 

12:58.040 --> 13:01.601
as individuals, 
as a society and civilization, 

13:02.560 --> 13:07.009
<i> There are three types of history, I 
mean, what is not 2000 years ago, </ i> </i>

13:07.320 --> 13:10.802
I mean all the knowledge, 
using the last week, 

13:11.760 --> 13:14.730
<i> History form one 
is supported industrially, </ i> </i>

13:14.880 --> 13:18.487
It's knowing how to concrete, 
Producing window or pumps, 

13:18.640 --> 13:23.646
It seems dry and boring, 
but is of the utmost importance, 

13:23.800 --> 13:26.610
It comprises the harvesting, 
Metal fabrication ,,, 

13:28.200 --> 13:33.286
<i> History form two no one cares, 
but it is also not threatened, </ i> </i>

13:33.600 --> 13:36.888
It is knowledge of industrial origin, 

13:37.080 --> 13:39.048
that is no longer viable, 

13:39.200 --> 13:43.000
These include books, 
are no longer moved, 

13:43.480 --> 13:45.323
<i> Then there is the third form, </ i> </i>

13:45.640 --> 13:49.326
It is intellectual knowledge, 
the most interesting, 

13:49.480 --> 13:52.051
For it is not supported, 

13:52.200 --> 13:56.046
<i> This branch history 
was never very pronounced, </ i> </i>

13:56.200 --> 14:00.489
It's about 
as human institutions act, 

14:03.320 --> 14:07.962
<i> To strengthen its industrial power 
and to be unpredictable, </ i> </i>

14:08.320 --> 14:11.927
<i> have the facilities 
concealed this knowledge, </ i> </i>

14:12.120 --> 14:15.727
<i> If someone finds something 
Secret documents about, </ i> </i>

14:15.880 --> 14:20.090
or corporate strategic documents 
or Enron-mails, 

14:20.240 --> 14:23.483
<i> and she wants to bring to light, </ i> </i>

14:23.640 --> 14:28.965
mechanisms are set in motion, 
to suppress this knowledge, 

14:34.960 --> 14:37.167
This branch is interesting, 

14:37.320 --> 14:41.245
The other two we already have, 
This we have not, 

14:44.680 --> 14:48.651
<i> Political theories tell us 
how the world has to be, </ i> </i>

14:48.800 --> 14:51.485
and how to act or not, 

14:51.640 --> 14:54.849
<i> to make things work one way or another, </ i> </i>

14:55.200 --> 14:59.330
We should ask, 
what these political theories are based, 

15:07.400 --> 15:12.964
<i> If we look at the facilities, 
so they all act unjustly, </ i> </i>

15:13.120 --> 15:15.521
<i> Some much more than others, </ i> </i>

15:16.160 --> 15:19.926
<i> The knowledge that we 
helps to greater justice, </ i> </i>

15:20.240 --> 15:23.608
<i> is, 
the back keep the facilities, </ i> </i>

15:30.520 --> 15:34.286
This shows 
that this knowledge can make a difference, 

15:34.600 --> 15:38.491
<i> is why I say 
that censorship is to be rejected, although, </ i> </i>

15:38.800 --> 15:42.122
but at the same time is an opportunity, 

15:42.280 --> 15:45.682
Because it shows the fear 
before reforms knowledge, 

15:45.880 --> 15:48.281
<i> If knowledge is so disclosed, </ i> </i>

15:48.440 --> 15:53.970
then the resulting action 
and this action to an on reform, "

16:33.640 --> 16:38.328
<i> To all units:House fire in 
Collingwood corner of West Second Avenue, </ I> </i>

16:38.480 --> 16:42.087
<i> suspect with Motocross Suit 
was sighted, </ i> </i>

16:42.240 --> 16:44.208
Report <i> All available units, </ i> </i>

16:44.360 --> 16:48.490
Why land ranging Stars 
and white stockbroker, 

16:48.800 --> 16:51.929
take the drug every day, 
not in jail? 

16:52.280 --> 16:55.204
Because you as a rich 
're above the law, 

16:57.560 --> 17:02.248
<i> You watch "Lincoln" and think 
the war was to free the slaves, </ i> </i>

17:02.400 --> 17:05.085
<i> Spielberg makes you so even dumber, </ i> </i>

17:05.240 --> 17:10.609
They ensure that the film 
will be shown in schools and television, 

17:10.760 --> 17:14.526
but actually 
went there in every war for money, 

17:14.720 --> 17:18.770
And the fools must die, 
because the elite decides, 

17:19.599 --> 17:24.049
You're watching every day reality TV, 
to kill your time, 

17:24.359 --> 17:26.806
And you think you knew communication, 

17:26.960 --> 17:32.091
because you Anderson Cooper and 
others without their own opinion look at, 

17:34.880 --> 17:37.121
Hey, man, how much money do you have? 

17:42.240 --> 17:44.129
Buddy ,,, 

18:01.840 --> 18:05.242
Do you remember me? Yes? 

18:06.120 --> 18:08.646
What is wrong with your friend? 

18:08.800 --> 18:10.689
He is dead, 

18:13.400 --> 18:15.607
What's wrong with your friend? 

18:16.600 --> 18:18.762
He is dead, 

18:18.920 --> 18:20.809
What did I tell you? 

18:22.160 --> 18:25.130
- That it is cold, 
- Yes, it is cold, 

18:25.280 --> 18:29.251
Now your friend is dead, 
because you have done nothing, 

18:30.120 --> 18:32.088
You'll be next, 

19:02.720 --> 19:04.722
Oh, closed? 

19:04.880 --> 19:06.803
No more bingo, 

19:17.440 --> 19:19.090
I have the 27 Bingo! 

19:21.160 --> 19:23.049
Bingo? 

19:35.480 --> 19:37.642
Okay, No Bailout for you, 

19:49.640 --> 19:55.044
It does not matter what you look like, 
Trademarks or drugs play no role, 

19:55.360 --> 19:57.488
That should keep you stupid, 

19:57.640 --> 20:02.487
Free press, television, movies, 
Schools, universities and religions 

20:02.640 --> 20:06.087
are all opium of the people, 
as Karl Marx would say, 

20:06.240 --> 20:09.767
I want you to wake up 
and be ye, 

20:09.920 --> 20:14.881
<i> shooting in the Fir, corner Eighth, 
Suspect with helmet and mask, </ I> </i>

<i> He drives a gray Honda, 
Be careful, </ I> </i>

20:18.320 --> 20:20.766
I'm the best moderator here, 

20:21.080 --> 20:23.447
I have other options, 

20:25.680 --> 20:31.323
How long before I am 
the best presenter of the city? 

20:31.640 --> 20:34.371
Two years? Jeez! 

20:39.640 --> 20:42.962
Most here 
are incompetent assholes, 

20:54.280 --> 20:59.684
You are late, do their job 
not, do not inform properly! 

21:02.480 --> 21:07.008
Do you think you get these prices 
without me? Do you think that? No, 

21:59.960 --> 22:05.285
Ladies and Gentlemen! welcome 
the new attraction of Las Vegas! 

22:06.200 --> 22:08.123
I can catch balls! 

22:08.280 --> 22:12.649
And I will you and me 
lead to a higher level! 

22:12.960 --> 22:15.327
Stop! You do not have to do! 

22:22.280 --> 22:24.169
Shit! Oh shit! 

22:27.440 --> 22:31.764
- You back, go! 
- More space is not, Come! 

22:46.160 --> 22:48.845
Hey, where are you going? 

23:24.720 --> 23:28.327
Where is he? 

23:32.400 --> 23:34.209
Oh, hi! 

23:34.360 --> 23:37.887
You are so sweet, 
as ye as hidden, 

23:38.200 --> 23:41.488
Why do they put you back here going? 

23:41.640 --> 23:45.361
Come out, Come on, 
I need you, Let's go, 

23:46.200 --> 23:48.009

24:04.280 --> 24:07.841
Go there! Do not even

Nice and slow! Forward, forward! 

24:52.000 --> 24:54.321
Forward! Here, go! 

24:54.640 --> 24:56.961

24:57.120 --> 25:00.124
Hey, hey! Stop, Right here, right here!

You stay right here, Do not move,

No fucking move! 

25:13.680 --> 25:15.569

Chip, the famous news anchor, 

25:23.880 --> 25:26.042
Chip, chip, Chip! 

25:26.200 --> 25:28.089
Are you under there? 

25:28.720 --> 25:31.530
I think I see you, 

25:37.280 --> 25:39.328
Hey, Baldy!

25:40.200 --> 25:42.806

25:42.960 --> 25:45.088

28:21.240 --> 28:23.846
Sit on the damn chair! 

28:26.960 --> 28:32.251
Do not do so, as if you were suddenly 
just like the others, you asshole, 

28:33.760 --> 28:36.764
You there, 
you should sit in a chair? 

28:37.800 --> 28:39.962
If you sit on the chair? 

28:43.560 --> 28:47.485
This happens if you do not 
keep my instructions, 

28:47.800 --> 28:50.644
Chip, sit the fuck down! 

28:52.480 --> 28:54.482
Come on, man, 

28:55.600 --> 29:00.891

can argue out, okay? 

29:01.200 --> 29:05.330
Chip, chip, Chip ,,,

- Yes, 

30:46.920 --> 30:49.969
- How many hostages are there? 
- Ten, fifteen, 

30:50.120 --> 30:54.011
- Do you know where they are? 
- He led them to the basement 

30:54.200 --> 30:58.125
He looks like a Robo Cop out, 
with two machine guns, 

30:58.440 --> 31:01.250
I need two men, 
Searches top everything, 

31:01.400 --> 31:04.404
Built the camp 
on the northwest side of the house, 

31:17.560 --> 31:20.166
- Where did he come from? 
- He came up here, 

31:24.600 --> 31:27.126
Look at this, My God ,,, 

31:30.320 --> 31:34.644
Here are dozens of injuries, 
Send more ambulances, 

31:34.960 --> 31:39.249
Alpha Team, lock the outputs, 
No one is allowed in or out, 

31:40.600 --> 31:42.489
That crap! 

31:44.880 --> 31:50.250
Listen, what can we do, 
to the put in order? 

31:51.160 --> 31:52.844
Okay? 

31:53.480 --> 31:55.926
You know, Chip, what can you do? 

31:56.800 --> 31:59.280
You could get rid of the corpse, 

31:59.440 --> 32:01.647
Bring her around the corner, 

32:01.800 --> 32:03.768
She scares people, 

32:11.400 --> 32:13.289
Get her away! 

32:14.800 --> 32:16.689
Listen ,,, 

32:17.440 --> 32:19.920
It's hard, Can anyone help me? 

32:20.280 --> 32:24.001
I have all day long 
Corpses dragged around, 

32:27.160 --> 32:30.050
Okay, Pick someone to help you, 

32:30.200 --> 32:32.567
Would anyone ,,, 

32:33.720 --> 32:38.123
Give me short, 
Come, It's hard, 

32:39.080 --> 32:41.606
Okay, let's get him over here, 

32:43.160 --> 32:45.049
Come here long, 

32:51.520 --> 32:54.729
Okay, let's get him in here, Okay, 

32:54.880 --> 32:57.406
Come on, back here! 

32:58.720 --> 33:02.202
Chip, sit down on the chair, 
and you on the floor, 

33:03.080 --> 33:05.731
It is good it all again, 

33:09.440 --> 33:14.128
The Swat team assembles 
probably just outside, 

33:16.040 --> 33:19.931
You will not come in, 
for they know ,,, 

33:20.480 --> 33:24.041
that I had no choice, 
as all to shoot, 

33:25.160 --> 33:30.963
There are probably 15 to 20 hostages, and 
probably only a suspect, 

33:31.320 --> 33:33.322
There is only one way to the basement, 

33:33.640 --> 33:37.531
This door is locked, 
and he has barricaded himself, 

33:37.680 --> 33:42.481
Meaning, it is really just pure here, 
There is no way out, 

33:43.080 --> 33:45.401
Yes, sir, Yes, I am, 

33:46.120 --> 33:48.168
He barricaded himself in the basement, 

33:48.480 --> 33:52.246
The ventilation system is too narrow, 
Since no one can enter or exit, 

33:52.400 --> 33:55.210
I'm trying, 
To get audio and video recordings, 

33:55.880 --> 33:59.327
I'll keep you up to date 
and await instructions, 

34:00.880 --> 34:04.282
I need to see 
what's going on, understand? 

34:05.720 --> 34:07.802
Chip, I have a request, 

34:36.040 --> 34:38.485
Are you married, Chip? 

34:38.639 --> 34:40.722

- Yes? 

34:41.639 --> 34:45.531

34:45.679 --> 34:48.922
Seven years, 
Happy seven years, what? 

34:49.239 --> 34:52.880
- Does it run well? Do you love her? 
- Yes, I'm lucky, 

34:54.520 --> 34:57.603
- You sure they want to see again, 
- Yes, 

34:58.680 --> 35:00.250
Okay, 

35:02.880 --> 35:05.326
We all want to get out there again, 

35:07.800 --> 35:10.167
That is what we will do, 

35:10.320 --> 35:11.845
Chip, 

35:16.280 --> 35:19.887
You do not want it, 
that your colleagues die, 

35:20.040 --> 35:22.281
- No, of course not, 
- Okay, 

35:23.160 --> 35:25.481
So, that's the plan, 

35:27.600 --> 35:32.128
You bring up the 
and can send it, 

35:33.040 --> 35:34.849
Nationally, 

35:35.400 --> 35:39.041
I have a lot of followers, 

35:39.240 --> 35:42.084
and a lot of fans around the world, 

35:42.840 --> 35:44.683

You are antwittern me 
write me e-mails, they are ,,, 

35:50.440 --> 35:55.731
You will let me know 
if people see this, okay? 

35:56.600 --> 35:58.523
What's this? 

35:59.440 --> 36:01.886
You'll see already, but 

36:03.600 --> 36:05.682
I want you to do that, 

36:05.840 --> 36:09.242
And you'd better come down again, 
Okay? 

36:10.000 --> 36:13.322
If not, all will die, 

36:14.080 --> 36:19.371
Then I want you to 
come back with a camera crew, 

36:19.520 --> 36:23.684
Cable television, And then we make 
an exclusive interview with me, 

36:23.840 --> 36:27.049
And we will send live, Do you get the point? 

36:33.000 --> 36:35.321
You come back immediately, 

36:37.000 --> 36:39.002
You come back again, 

36:39.160 --> 36:43.165
I do not know how long it takes 
until I can send the, 

36:43.320 --> 36:46.244
Promise 
that you do not fool anyone, 

36:46.560 --> 36:50.167
You have one hour, chip, 
or I'll shoot all, 

36:50.320 --> 36:55.247
- I do not know how long it takes, 
- One hour, You can do it, 

36:56.120 --> 36:59.010
Promise 
that you do not fool anyone, 

36:59.160 --> 37:03.768
You simply come with a camera crew, 
when the has been sent, 

37:05.800 --> 37:10.488
Okay, Stay calm, 
Trust me, I'll be back, 

37:17.280 --> 37:20.602
- Chip, close your door,

37:21.400 --> 37:26.850
- You hurt them, promised? 
- Chip, you give me your word, 

37:30.320 --> 37:32.209
Close your door, Chip! 

37:40.080 --> 37:41.650

37:47.880 --> 37:49.609
- Are you all right? 
- Yes, 

37:49.760 --> 37:51.967
How many hostages are there? 

37:52.680 --> 37:55.763

37:56.400 --> 38:01.088
I think six women ,,, 
Listen, I do not have time for this! 

38:01.400 --> 38:05.007
Listen, 
The man in there is Bill Williamson, 

38:05.160 --> 38:08.323
The one who 
has committed the greatest rampage of the United States, 

38:08.680 --> 38:10.842
I was there, 

38:16.840 --> 38:19.081
I know exactly who he is, 

38:19.880 --> 38:21.644
He is back, 

38:21.960 --> 38:24.327

He wants me to send the country, 

38:27.240 --> 38:30.084
Within an hour, 
or he kills them all, 

38:30.440 --> 38:35.082
He also wants a camera crew 
for a live interview,

Would you kidding me? 
The killing me, 

39:37.560 --> 39:39.528
He will not shoot,

39:42.760 --> 39:46.003
He sure has a copy, 
He will not kill you, 

39:46.160 --> 39:50.643
, The most important thing for him 
to send and to conduct the interview,

Are you crying about? 

52:51.120 --> 52:52.770
Are you crying? 

52:53.920 --> 52:55.843
This is sick, 

52:57.720 --> 53:00.963
I'm done, 
I do not do more, 

53:03.600 --> 53:06.331
They kill me, or I sit down, 

53:18.640 --> 53:20.369
Wow! 

53:21.840 --> 53:23.808
Look up the times on one, 

53:25.480 --> 53:27.642
A man with eggs, 

53:27.800 --> 53:31.850
A man who really has guts ,,, what? 

53:33.040 --> 53:34.644
Very courageous, 

53:36.240 --> 53:40.006
If there were more of your kind, 
the world would be better, 

53:44.320 --> 53:46.084
Good job, 

53:58.240 --> 54:00.129
No one stirs! 

54:37.320 --> 54:40.483
Again:
As soon as he speaks with his father, 

54:40.800 --> 54:43.963
do you use from the 
and shoots him between the eyes, 

54:44.280 --> 54:46.009
All right '? 

54:48.240 --> 54:51.210
We just wait, come back to Chip, 

54:52.320 --> 54:54.482
Stay in the other line, 

54:55.760 --> 54:57.569

55:18.040 --> 55:24.047
It's been a hour, I've had enough, 
Sends the stuff now, or you're flying, 

55:24.360 --> 55:27.603
<i> - It takes so long time now, 
- This is ridiculous </ i>, </i>

55:31.440 --> 55:34.125
I get a lot of messages, 

55:35.880 --> 55:38.611
200 ,,, 220 messages, 

55:38.760 --> 55:41.366
"Bill, still no video," 

55:44.400 --> 55:46.209
"Bill! 

55:46.920 --> 55:50.561
Where is the news 
you promised us? "

55:51.360 --> 55:53.249
"You do not show it, Bill," 

55:57.640 --> 56:01.326
A simple damn thing 

56:01.840 --> 56:03.729
he should do, 

56:04.760 --> 56:06.649
And he did not get out, 

56:09.400 --> 56:12.006
Do you know what he might do? 

56:12.160 --> 56:16.484
He sits in his Ferrari 
in a 2000 dollar suit, 

56:17.920 --> 56:20.082
And just drive home, 

56:21.240 --> 56:23.686
He forgets that he ever knew you, 

56:28.000 --> 56:30.321
Because of him ,,, 

56:30.760 --> 56:32.569
you will all die, 

56:35.560 --> 56:37.369
All of you, 

56:37.520 --> 56:39.409
Because a person, 

56:40.920 --> 56:43.002
Not because of me, 

56:44.320 --> 56:46.209
Because of him, 

56:46.960 --> 56:50.009
VIDEO RUNNING! 
YOUR PLAN WORKED, 

56:50.160 --> 56:51.605
FORCED BROADCAST 

56:57.840 --> 57:01.447
That, dear viewers, is 
a possibly unique opportunity 

57:01.640 --> 57:05.247
a few minutes 
uncensored material to see, 

57:05.440 --> 57:07.681
I have something important to say, 

57:07.840 --> 57:13.131
I had to kill and will even 
tems to send my message, 

57:13.760 --> 57:18.846
I've decided your interests 
to ask about my life, 

57:19.000 --> 57:22.925
I would like, 
that you wake up and change you, 

57:23.120 --> 57:26.886
Before I tell you what you should do, 
I give you the facts, 

57:27.040 --> 57:29.486
And I'm talking about facts, 

57:29.840 --> 57:32.969
The NSA stores all calls, 
E-mails and SMS, 

57:33.120 --> 57:38.001
People like Snowden or Assange, 
which provide valuable information, 

57:38.160 --> 57:41.130
be prosecuted by the U,S, government, 

57:41.280 --> 57:43.681
It is funded by the rich, 

57:44.000 --> 57:49.086
She wants the people ignorant and 
hold the intellectual level of children, 

57:49.640 --> 57:52.723
It keeps the people 
preoccupied with making money, 

57:52.880 --> 57:55.486
They should be about family, 
House and lawn care, 

57:55.640 --> 57:58.041
People should think 
that they are free, 

57:58.240 --> 58:00.447
and can do whatever they want, 

58:00.600 --> 58:02.204
They can not, 

58:02.520 --> 58:06.605
Your representatives are paid 
to keep you stupid, 

58:06.760 --> 58:10.242
In your stupid little world, 

58:10.960 --> 58:14.123
Why is the sale of arms 
not controlled, 

58:14.280 --> 58:17.170
although there are monthly rampages? 

58:17.480 --> 58:21.007
Are performed annually in the United States 
11000 people shot, 

58:21.160 --> 58:23.640
In the UK only 300 Why? 

58:23.960 --> 58:28.329
Because Great Britain ,,, has no weapons, 

58:28.520 --> 58:32.525
The people have no weapons, Point, 

58:32.680 --> 58:37.242
What have I done, what happens 
that there is no gun control, 

58:37.400 --> 58:41.121
There are not even 
the criminal history check, Why? 

58:41.440 --> 58:45.240
Because 50 percent of the politicians 
be paid by the gun lobby, 

58:45.560 --> 58:47.608
So, wake up, 

58:47.960 --> 58:49.007
PREVENT GOVERNMENT 
TO HEALTHCARE REFORM 

58:49.160 --> 58:54.485
Health insurance for at least 
95 percent of Americans an advantage, 

58:54.640 --> 58:57.086
The entire developed world has one, 

58:57.240 --> 59:00.210
Nearly 50 percent of Americans 
on the other hand, 

59:00.360 --> 59:03.011
due to the brainwashing by the media, 

59:03.160 --> 59:05.561
The Iraq war was a crime, 

59:05.880 --> 59:09.601
Powell, Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld 
have all lied, 

59:09.920 --> 59:14.767
Saddam had nothing to do with 
Weapons of mass destruction or al-Qaida, 

59:14.920 --> 59:18.367
the Saudis 
have financed the Sept, 11, 

59:18.680 --> 59:21.286
Because of the oil we do nothing against them, 

59:21.600 --> 59:26.288
We send soldiers to countries with 
local attacks have nothing to do, 

59:26.440 --> 59:28.841
Why not accused Obama Bush? 

59:29.040 --> 59:33.648
Bush cost the taxpayers billions 
and committed war crimes, 

59:34.000 --> 59:36.207
Why Obama is doing nothing? 

59:36.360 --> 59:39.250
Because he belongs to the club, 

59:39.560 --> 59:43.690
There were more immigrants 
reported under Obama than before, 

59:44.000 --> 59:46.002
Why does not he closed Guantanamo, 

59:46.320 --> 59:51.929
where prisoners without charges, evidence or 
a method for 13 years sitting? 

59:52.080 --> 59:56.563
He was not against the rules 
defense law, 

59:56.880 --> 01:00:01.807
the indefinite detention allowed 
also of Americans without trial, 

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:06.404
We have a constitutional crisis 
in the United States, a rogue state, 

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:09.166
International law is violated, 

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:14.042
the Magna Carta, which our sense 
impressed for justice for 800 years, 

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:17.283
Obama should pay for it 
and go to jail, 

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:19.568
Since we're talking about the jail ,,, 

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:25.966
The United States 5% of the world population, 
but 25% of the prisoners, 

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:29.567
People migrate 
for ten grams of cocaine in jail, 

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:32.645
Half sitting 
possession of drugs in prison,

More than half of it is black, 

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:39.207
Why changes 
this absurd situation not? 

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:44.851
Because Washington of the prison lobby 
is paid to run it, 

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:49.205
<i> Why land ranging Stars 
and stockbrokers ,,, </ i> </i>

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:51.682

We should it 
Set as talk show host, 

01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:02.000
Do you think the Morgans, Vanderbilts, 
Rockafellers and other assholes 

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:05.164
did with their alms something good? 

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:08.529
You overlook, 
that their money was stolen 

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:11.326
and they should not have to be rich, 

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:15.650
What I want from you, 
of the mass is the following:

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:18.041
I want you to change the world, 

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:21.807
This is not peaceful, 
and you can not do it alone, 

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:25.329
We need to kill the rich, 
Go on the road,

We need a purge, 
We need a Neustan, 

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:49.041
We are actually

Everyone has us on the screen, anywhere, 
Everyone knows us, 

01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:01.168
We must destroy the system, 
But I can not do alone, 

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:03.840
I need you now, 

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.731

That's pretty good, right? '

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:22.362
I could be president, 

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:28.766
Do you understand what I'm feeling here? 

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:32.888
As each of you 
can change the world? 

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:35.569
Is not it '? 

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:38.726
We can change together! 

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.608
Now you understand slowly, right? 
Now you understand slowly,

One of my men will with

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:18.010
Wait a minute, 

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:20.084

Protection? 
Because of him I'm on it, 

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:28.005

It's about the hostages, 
not for their shitty interview, 

01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:46.250
The people in there 
must be saved, 

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:48.881
I know, okay, Then come, 

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:51.361
Wait, one more thing,

- What? I can not do, 
- But, 

01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:09.442
his father 
can hopefully change his mind, 

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:12.331
Maybe he is on 
and can free the hostages, 

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.802

hides the last year?

What I have done in the past? 
Why is this important? 

01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:55.770
Okay, 

01:13:55.920 --> 01:14:00.448
Can I give you a few questions 
question about your background? 

01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:02.443
Who are you, Chip? 

01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:06.648
Maybe that's a better question, 
Who are you? 

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:09.724
You've read the Assange font, 

01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:12.446
Do you understand what you read? 

01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:17.769
- I understand his concern, 
- You've read it literally, or '? 

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:24.011
At some point you wanted to secure 
know the truth, right? 

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:28.290
Before you have you worried about your money, 
and television appearances, 

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:31.324
Sure you wanted 
be a real journalist, 

01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:34.131
I'm a real journalist, 

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:38.325
But I also believe in law 
and order and the constitution, 

01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:41.811
It is a control system of the rich, 

01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:45.521
They are the law, 
they made the Constitution, 

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:48.650
for the protection of money and land, 
she stole, 

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:51.167
The rich are above the law, 

01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:54.324
All over, 
Look at the Russian oligarchs, 

01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:59.327
In Germany, it is the owner 
Bayer, BASF, BMW, VW, 

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:03.207
under Hitler 
they have all used slave labor, 

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:06.882
There are still 
same owners, 

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:10.123
The Royals in England, 
the rich Africans ,,, 

01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:12.965
You have all 
their own people killed, 

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:15.930
They undergo all brainwashed, 

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:19.562
We crawl rich oil sheiks 
in the ass, 

01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:23.281
Gucci and Lexus cars 
Buy and all U,S, companies, 

01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:25.442
The daily bring to people, 

01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:29.003
You give women no rights 
and kill gays, 

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:32.369
We do not care, 
because they have the money, 

01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:36.924
our rulers 
are gangsters in pinstripe suits, 

01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:38.969
You shit on the law, 

01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:44.241
You have the system 
Homeland Security perfecting, 

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:48.610
You have given us the basic 
taken and liberties, 

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:53.721
You have the three branches of government 
completely taken for itself, 

01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:59.524
You control the information networks, 
to spread their lies, 

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:02.684
You are part of it, chip, 
like everyone else, 

01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:06.526
The moderators and editors 
are all bought, 

01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:11.368
Right? 
What is the goal of this transmitter '? 

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:18.482
We have in the past two hours 
Taken $ 2,8 million, 

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:22.042
Through this mission, 
I have sold it, 

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:24.168
To all the damn station, 

01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:26.209
This is terrific, 

01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:29.204
and chip 
has signed a contract, 

01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:33.610
So I have the rights to him, 
He will be a star, 

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:38.968
How does that feel, 
someone to take his own life? 

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:45.009
Have you ever 
hit someone in the face? 

01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:47.408
Certainly, 

01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:49.369
Once or twice? 

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:54.048
Do you have the connection 
felt in your own? 

01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:57.167
Meat on meat, 

01:16:57.320 --> 01:16:59.209
This sound, 

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:03.203
There is nothing deeper going Deres, right? 

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:07.769
We can still 
chat all day, 

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:10.048
But what makes the people? 

01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:12.089
Going back, 

01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:16.529
Going back to our original state, 

01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:22.289
When we killed for our food, 
have hunted and gathered, 

01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:25.091
We killed animals, 
to eat them, 

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:28.649
Now they are killed by machine, 

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:30.530
Is it not so? 

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:34.605
The human race has 
completely away, 

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:39.047
Have you ever 
bending over a dead man? 

01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:42.329
Smelled the blood? 

01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:46.130
the heat 
ausquellenden felt the blood? 

01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:50.884
No, 

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:54.522
Then you feel 
what it means to be human, 

01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:58.487
Then you know who you are, 

01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:01.729
In the most basic sense, 

01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:06.967
Not you? 
There is nothing truer than that, right? 

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:12.369
There is nothing truer than ,,, pain, 

01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:18.928
Not only emotional pain, 
but real physical pain, 

01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:21.129
And you think that ,,, 

01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:26.961
killing of innocents 
a solution is? 

01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:31.650
Yes, I mean, 

01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:37.081
Is not the solution to America 
used around the world? 

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:39.689
With their drones? 

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:44.721
Take the drone bombs 
or sweets to the children from, Chip? 

01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:49.883
They kill 50 children, chip, 
to meet a terrorist, 

01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:52.561
We do not plunder the third world? 

01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:58.090
Do not let others starve 
and die for our lifestyle? 

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:02.405
These are difficult circumstances, 
exclude the peaceful talk, 

01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:04.927
We see crime and global warming, 

01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:09.404
the lobbyists who bought Washington, 
the financial collapse, 

01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:13.007
And we feel the end yet 
with printing money out, 

01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:16.050
In the latest 50 years, everything is off, 

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:21.001
There are more and more people, but 
less and less water, food and oil, 

01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:23.971
100 years, there is no earth, 

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:26.800
Words mean nothing, or '? 

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:32.321
I can influence this life only, 
by I suppose, 

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:37.167
I can only affect you, 

01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:40.364
by I kill you, 

01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:47.766
Would not be the appropriate solution, 
to found a party? 

01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:51.970
Find trailers, let 
be selected, Change something, 

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:54.521
I will let you choose me? What for? 

01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:56.768
You do not hear me, 

01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:00.280
What should I let me choose? 

01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:03.045
Let that shit, 

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:05.243
It's not about politics, 

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:08.887
Whether Democrat or Republican, 
does not matter, 

01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:14.331
All these Democrats, Republicans 
and governors are bought, 

01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:19.650
We can choose someone 
but it does not matter, 

01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:22.770
the lobbyists 
have everything under control, 

01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:26.961
There are always two sides, 
Everyone has an opinion, 

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:32.968
Is not that the beauty of democracy, 
that everyone can express his opinion? 

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:37.728
Yes, as long as these expressions of opinion 
change anything, 

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:43.641
Julian Assange, Hammond and Snowden 
are the prophets of today, 

01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:47.009
They are the voices, 
the cry, 

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:50.881
And they are the ones 
wants to kill the State, 

01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:55.848
There is no more democracy, 
We can not speak our minds, 

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:00.528
For this interview, I'm 
without trial in prison, 

01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:02.728
Forever, After Guantanamo, 

01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:05.481
This is no longer our voice, 

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:09.522
- Could not you change that? 
- No, I can not, 

01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:15.890
This is the only way 
to change things, 

01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:24.200
Bill, you seem like someone who ,,, 

01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:31.685
a strong attachment to the mother, has 
if I may say so, 

01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:39.529
What is this feeling that you 
could not be there when she died? 

01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:51.321
You want to talk about my mother? 

01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:58.401
My mother was a good woman, 

01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:02.882
I was very important to her, 

01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:07.202
You would have done anything for me, 

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:10.961
And I would do anything for them, 

01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:15.007
Nothing is ever going to change anything, 

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:21.327
Nothing is ever going to change anything, 

01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:25.848
Would they agree with 
what you do? 

01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:28.361
This has nothing to do with her, 

01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:30.648
Some things are bigger than 

01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:32.683
larger than the family, 

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:36.726
This is about the human race, 

01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:38.769
To our survival, 

01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:41.528
Do you understand that? 

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:43.768
So people will die, 

01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:45.969
People die chip, 

01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:48.729
Life goes on, 

01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:51.444
Is not it '? 

01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:56.362
Life must go on, 

01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:00.009
No matter what happens, 
Despite all the odds, 

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:02.289
Wow, that's ,,, 

01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:04.882
This is strong, Bill, 

01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:08.323
How do we proceed? 

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:20.647
I will be fumigated, 

01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:24.451
I'm going to die, Right here, 

01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:29.845
Are you so keep your word and ,,, 

01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:35.280
all the people let go, 
or you will kill us? 

01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:40.291
Yes, I will keep my word, Chip, 

01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:42.408
I let the people go, 

01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:46.609
But do not 
my little puppet, 

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:49.170
You stay here, 

01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:52.280
You stay here and die with me, 

01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:56.363
I may die here, 

01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:59.286
but I die with one voice, 

01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:09.603
Okay, get up every man! 

01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:13.051
You all go very slowly to the door! 

01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:17.041
You can not fumigate me 
I have a gas mask, 

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:20.609
We regulate the 
the old-Alamo-An, 

01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:23.929
Now get out with you! 

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:34.244
Complete the hostages 
as quickly as possible away from here, 

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:37.449
It's over, 
Take the gun down! 

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:42.849
Are you kidding me? 

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.527
WK7 TV STATION EXPLODES

<i> The families of the victims can

01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:57.451
Do you have that God exists, 
and donate your money to churches? 

01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:00.809
I tell you something:
There is no God, 

01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:04.567
There was never a 
and one will never exist, 

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:09.684
You will die, 
be buried, and that's it, 

01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:41.088
No one stirs! 

01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:31.240
- Hey, Little One, what are you reading? 
- A book, 

01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:36.600
Do not you know that books are crap, 
and your parents and teachers talk crap? 

01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:39.491
That's what counts here, Seen before? 

01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:44.202
You pull back and hit the off, 
To your parents, because they talk crap, 

01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:48.684
At yourself in the end, 
Now take it and disappear, 

01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:54.280
I want you to change the world, 

01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:57.330
That you can not peacefully 
or alone, 

01:28:57.480 --> 01:29:00.563
You must kill the rich, 
Go on the road, 

01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:03.530
Take your weapons 
and divided Washington, 

01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:07.924
Bring all the route:
Billionaires, bankers, CEOs, 

01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:11.243
Liar, governors, 
Lobbyists, senators, 

01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:16.247
They are all the same, Hang them 
on the first tree that can be found! 

01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:20.246
We need a purge, 
We need a reboot, 

01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:22.767
We need a new chance, 

01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:25.725
But I can not do alone, 

01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:27.888
I need you now, 

01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:30.520
We need each other now, 

01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:35.845
I thank you in advance for your help, 

01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:40.643
