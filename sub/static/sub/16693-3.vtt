WEBVTT

00:02.461 --> 00:03.962
TONIGHT ON
<i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARES...</i>

00:03.962 --> 00:06.882
THE PLACE IS LITTERED
WITH.

00:06.882 --> 00:09.092
CHEF RAMSAY MAKES
HIS FIRST VISIT TO COLORADO

00:09.092 --> 00:11.053
AND IS FACED
WITH A RESTAURANT

00:11.053 --> 00:13.639
THAT HASN'T CHANGED ANYTHING
IN 33 YEARS.

00:13.639 --> 00:15.515
THIS PLACE FEELS

00:15.515 --> 00:17.100
LIKE IT'S BEEN CLOSED
FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS.

00:17.100 --> 00:20.062
IT'S THE LOOK
THAT THE RESTAURANT HAS.

00:20.062 --> 00:22.064
THE OWNER WHO RUNS
THE FRONT OF HOUSE...

00:22.064 --> 00:23.065
<i>WOW.</i>

00:23.065 --> 00:24.066
IS AN OUT-OF-CONTROL HOARDER.

00:24.066 --> 00:25.817
DOES IT WORK?
NO.

00:25.817 --> 00:27.152
AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE...

00:28.237 --> 00:29.821
THE OWNER WHO RUNS THE KITCHEN

00:29.821 --> 00:30.000
IS COMPLETELY CLUELESS.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.406
IS COMPLETELY CLUELESS.

00:31.406 --> 00:34.076
YOU CROSS-CONTAMINATED
EVERY OUNCE

00:34.076 --> 00:36.161
OF INGREDIENTS
IN THIS KITCHEN.

00:36.161 --> 00:39.164
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST SHOCKING
AND FILTHIEST RESTAURANTS

00:39.164 --> 00:40.582
CHEF RAMSAY HAS EVER SEEN.

00:40.582 --> 00:43.335
DISGUSTING, DEPLORABLE MESS.

00:43.335 --> 00:44.878
AND YOU NOT BELIEVE
WHAT HE UNCOVERS...

00:44.878 --> 00:45.921
IT STINKS.

00:45.921 --> 00:48.215
IN THE DINING ROOM...
WOW.

00:48.215 --> 00:49.675
IN THE OFFICE...
GROSS.

00:49.675 --> 00:51.301
IN THE KITCHEN...
YOU ARE KIDDING ME.

00:51.301 --> 00:53.053
AND IN THE ENTRANCEWAY.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.972
OOH.
CAREFUL, SHE'S SLIPPERY.

00:54.972 --> 00:56.974
WHILE THE DECOR IS HORRID...

00:56.974 --> 00:58.809
THIS IS A HORROR SHOW.

00:58.809 --> 01:00.000
THE FOOD IS WRETCHED.

01:00.000 --> 01:00.143
THE FOOD IS WRETCHED.

01:00.143 --> 01:02.479
I WOULDN'T FEED THAT
TO THE  MANNEQUIN.

01:02.479 --> 01:05.023
AND UNBELIEVABLY,
THE HUSBAND AND WIFE OWNERS

01:05.023 --> 01:06.942
HAVE NO IDEA
WHY THEIR BUSINESS IS FAILING.

01:06.942 --> 01:09.861
A LOT OF PEOPLE ENJOY
THE THINGS THAT WE COOK.

01:09.861 --> 01:11.029
THE FOOD IS HIDEOUS.

01:11.029 --> 01:12.114
GET READY TO WITNESS...

01:12.114 --> 01:13.865
I'M NOT ACTUALLY TOO SURE
WHAT TO DO.

01:13.865 --> 01:15.534
ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT
CHALLENGES

01:15.534 --> 01:17.077
OF CHEF RAMSAY'S CAREER.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.079
MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST CLOSE IT DOWN

01:19.079 --> 01:21.415
AND LOSE EVERYTHING WE HAVE.

01:23.959 --> 01:25.127
WHAT IS THAT?

01:25.127 --> 01:27.087
YOU'RE SERVING ROTTEN FOOD.

01:27.087 --> 01:27.963
THEY'RE NOT CRAP.
THEY'RE DELICIOUS.

01:27.963 --> 01:30.000
THEN WAKE UP!
YOU WAKE UP!

01:30.000 --> 01:30.382
THEN WAKE UP!
YOU WAKE UP!

01:30.382 --> 01:31.466
SHUT THE PLACE DOWN.

01:31.466 --> 01:32.634
GET OUT OF HERE!

01:32.634 --> 01:34.386
<i>THAT IS AMAZING.</i>

01:34.386 --> 01:36.763
THAT'S EMBARRASSING!
OH, GOD!

01:36.763 --> 01:39.891
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

01:42.019 --> 01:45.439
ARVADA, COLORADO,
15 MINUTES FROM DENVER,

01:45.439 --> 01:47.858
IS HOME TO
THE OLD NEIGHBORHOOD RESTAURANT.

01:47.858 --> 01:49.985
OWNERS ALEXA AND RANDY
MET WHEN THEY WERE SERVERS

01:49.985 --> 01:51.528
DURING THEIR COLLEGE YEARS.

01:51.528 --> 01:52.988
THEY FULFILLED A DREAM

01:52.988 --> 01:55.574
WHEN THEY BOUGHT THE EATERY
IN 1988.

01:55.574 --> 01:56.867
ALMOST READY?

01:56.867 --> 01:58.327
READY AS EVER.

01:58.327 --> 02:00.000
MY WIFE AND I HAVE OWNED
THE RESTAURANT FOR 25 YEARS.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.204
MY WIFE AND I HAVE OWNED
THE RESTAURANT FOR 25 YEARS.

02:01.204 --> 02:02.873
AND WE'RE HERE
ALL THE TIME TOGETHER.

02:02.873 --> 02:04.124
THANK YOU, RANDY.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.208
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:05.208 --> 02:08.712
JUST TRYING TO DO MY JOB.

02:08.712 --> 02:12.049
THE BUSINESS HAS BEEN DECLINING
FOR PROBABLY ABOUT 13 YEARS.

02:12.049 --> 02:13.133
WHAT ELSE IS COMING BACK?

02:13.133 --> 02:14.718
<i>YOU HAVE ALL THE TICKETS</i>

02:14.718 --> 02:16.053
<i>THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE,</i>
<i>I BELIEVE.</i>

02:16.053 --> 02:18.972
JUST GO. I DON'T NEED YOU HERE.
GO, PLEASE.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.599
<i>OFF THE LINE.</i>

02:20.599 --> 02:22.559
BUT THE LAST THREE MONTHS
HAVE BEEN REALLY, REALLY HARD.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.895
AND WE DON'T KNOW,
REALLY, WHY.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.897
HOW ARE WE ALL DOING
THIS EVENING?

02:26.897 --> 02:28.607
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU PUT
IN THIS STEAK,

02:28.607 --> 02:30.000
BUT IT LEAVES
A TERRIBLE AFTERTASTE.

02:30.000 --> 02:30.067
BUT IT LEAVES
A TERRIBLE AFTERTASTE.

02:30.067 --> 02:34.488
I DON'T THINK THERE IS A MENU
IN THE COUNTRY

02:34.488 --> 02:37.074
THAT IS EVEN CLOSE TO OURS.

02:39.951 --> 02:42.037
WE HAVE THINGS LIKE
A SEDONA CHICKEN.

02:42.037 --> 02:44.456
WE HAVE TERIYAKI STEAK.

02:44.456 --> 02:45.832
WE HAVE BEEF WONTONS.

02:45.832 --> 02:48.502
WE ALSO HAVE
TROUT PARMESAN,

02:48.502 --> 02:51.963
BURRITOS, CAJUN CATFISH,
DUCK SCHNITZEL.

02:51.963 --> 02:53.548
IT'S REALLY WEIRD.

02:55.884 --> 02:57.803
IT'S NOT ONLY THE MENU
THAT'S OUT OF CONTROL,

02:57.803 --> 02:59.388
IT'S THE DECOR.

02:59.388 --> 03:00.000
WELCOME TO GRANDMA'S HOUSE.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.807
WELCOME TO GRANDMA'S HOUSE.

03:04.059 --> 03:07.312
IT'S DEFINITELY
ABOUT 40 YEARS OUT OF DATE.

03:07.312 --> 03:10.065
MY FATHER DOESN'T
THROW ANYTHING AWAY.

03:10.065 --> 03:13.360
HE'S DEFINITELY THE EPITOME
OF A HOARDER.

03:15.779 --> 03:17.948
EVERYTHING IN HERE
IS DECREPIT.

03:17.948 --> 03:21.326
THE WALLPAPER IS FALLING
OFF THE WALL.

03:21.326 --> 03:22.869
HALF OF THE CHAIRS ARE BROKEN.

03:22.869 --> 03:25.122
SO IT'S LIKE, SOMETIMES
WHEN PEOPLE SIT DOWN,

03:25.122 --> 03:27.165
THEY JUST GO DOWN.

03:27.165 --> 03:29.376
YOU LOST A WHEEL
OVER THERE?

03:29.376 --> 03:30.000
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, LOOK.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.212
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, LOOK.

03:34.172 --> 03:35.674
I THINK RANDY AND ALEXA

03:35.674 --> 03:37.551
ARE JUST KINDA STUCK
IN THEIR OLD WAYS.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.386
I DON'T THINK THAT
THEY'RE WILLING

03:39.386 --> 03:41.638
TO REALLY CHANGE
A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS.

03:41.638 --> 03:45.183
THEY HAVEN'T DONE MUCH
IN THE PAST 30 YEARS.

03:45.183 --> 03:47.144
MY WIFE AND I ARE IN DEBT

03:47.144 --> 03:50.605
TO THE TUNE
OF ABOUT $320,000.

03:50.605 --> 03:53.442
IF THE STRESS
DOESN'T SUBSIDE SOMEWHERE,

03:53.442 --> 03:56.945
SOMETHING DRASTIC
IS GONNA GIVE.

03:56.945 --> 04:00.000
US, OUR RELATIONSHIP,
THIS RESTAURANT--

04:00.000 --> 04:00.115
US, OUR RELATIONSHIP,
THIS RESTAURANT--

04:00.115 --> 04:02.784
WE CAN'T KEEP GOING
LIKE THIS.

04:11.376 --> 04:14.171
WOW.
"OLD NEIGHBORHOOD RESTAURANT."

04:14.171 --> 04:17.174
EVEN THE SIGN LOOKS OLD.

04:17.174 --> 04:18.842
WOW.

04:18.842 --> 04:20.844
OOH,.

04:23.472 --> 04:25.807
WHAT IS THAT THING?

04:25.807 --> 04:28.226
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

04:28.226 --> 04:30.000
STRANGE.

04:30.000 --> 04:30.771
STRANGE.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.105
GOOD AFTERNOON.
HOW ARE YOU, SIR?

04:32.105 --> 04:33.774
RANDY.
RANDY, GORDON.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.233
CHEF, NICE TO MEET YOU.
LIKEWISE.

04:35.233 --> 04:37.527
SO HAPPY TO BE HERE.
UH, WHAT IS THIS?

04:37.527 --> 04:40.280
WHAT IS THIS?
THIS THING HERE.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.700
FIONA?
WHO--WHO IS THIS?

04:43.700 --> 04:44.910
FIONA.
IT HAS A NAME?

04:44.910 --> 04:46.745
SHE HAS A NAME, YES.
COME ON, SERIOUSLY?

04:46.745 --> 04:47.954
IT'S NOT AN IT,
IT'S A SHE.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.748
WOW.
SHE CHANGES OUTFITS REGULARLY.

04:49.748 --> 04:50.707
OOH.

04:50.707 --> 04:52.793
CAREFUL, SHE'S SLIPPERY.

04:52.793 --> 04:55.462
NOW NO DISRESPECT,
BUT YOU WALK INTO A RESTAURANT,

04:55.462 --> 04:58.131
YOU DON'T EXPECT
TO SEE A MANNEQUIN THERE.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.000
UH, IT'S KIND OF
MY WIFE'S THING.

05:00.000 --> 05:00.884
UH, IT'S KIND OF
MY WIFE'S THING.

05:00.884 --> 05:02.803
OH.

05:03.887 --> 05:05.555
AND THESE?

05:05.555 --> 05:06.848
WELL, YOU KNOW,
SOMEBODY STOLE HER HANDS.

05:06.848 --> 05:08.225
OH.

05:08.225 --> 05:09.810
SHE'S DELICATE.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.353
SO THIS IS NOT A JOKE,
THIS IS SOMETHING

05:11.353 --> 05:13.188
THAT YOUR WIFE LOOKS AFTER,
HER MANNEQUIN?

05:13.188 --> 05:15.315
SHE DOES.
OKAY.

05:15.315 --> 05:19.069
WE HAVE PICTURES
OF PEOPLE WITH FIONA.

05:20.111 --> 05:23.615
UH--

05:23.615 --> 05:24.866
OKAY, RIGHT.

05:24.866 --> 05:26.243
<i>WELL, WHY DON'T YOU</i>
<i>GET YOUR DEAR WIFE,</i>

05:26.243 --> 05:27.869
AND WE'LL HAVE
A CATCH-UP TOGETHER, ALL RIGHT?

05:27.869 --> 05:28.995
I'LL PUT THIS THING BACK.
SURE.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.000
YEAH.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.414
YEAH.

05:31.414 --> 05:32.749
OH,.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.209
REALLY?

05:36.127 --> 05:38.713
MAN, THIS IS REALLY WEIRD.
MY GOD.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.048
CHEF BROKE FIONA.

05:40.048 --> 05:42.425
HE WANTS YOU
TO COME OUT HERE.
OH, NO.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.429
WHAT THE HELL?

05:46.429 --> 05:49.224
YOU ARE KIDDING ME.

05:49.224 --> 05:52.519
DAMN.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.271
HELLO. I'M ALEXA.
ALEXA, NICE TO SEE YOU.

05:54.271 --> 05:55.814
NICE TO MEET YOU.
LIKEWISE.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.440
UM, LET'S SIT DOWN
AT THE BAR, SHALL WE...

05:57.440 --> 05:59.317
<i>ABSOLUTELY.</i>
AND CATCH UP?

05:59.317 --> 06:00.000
UM, I THOUGHT RANDY
WAS WINDING ME UP,

06:00.000 --> 06:01.820
UM, I THOUGHT RANDY
WAS WINDING ME UP,

06:01.820 --> 06:04.698
BECAUSE HE SAID THAT
THAT DOLL IN THE WINDOW

06:04.698 --> 06:06.700
<i>IS, LIKE,</i>
<i>A FRIEND OF YOURS.</i>

06:06.700 --> 06:08.618
YEAH, SHE HAS HAD A COUPLE RIDES
IN THE CONVERTIBLE

06:08.618 --> 06:10.161
WHEN I'VE TRIED
TO TAKE HER HOME

06:10.161 --> 06:12.706
AND PUT HER AT PEACE
IN THE GARAGE.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.583
AND I HAD TO GO
RUN AN ERRAND FIRST, SO--

06:14.583 --> 06:16.585
STOP.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.713
OKAY, UH,

06:19.713 --> 06:20.714
YOU'VE HAD THIS PLACE
FOR HOW LONG?

06:20.714 --> 06:22.424
25 YEARS THAT WE'VE OWNED IT.
25 YEARS?

06:22.424 --> 06:24.885
WE BOTH WORKED HERE AS SERVERS
WHEN WE WERE COLLEGE STUDENTS

06:24.885 --> 06:26.845
AT THE UNIVERSITY
OF COLORADO.
AH, NICE.

06:26.845 --> 06:28.805
MY OLDEST ONE, WILEY,
WORKS HERE PART-TIME.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.000
OKAY, GREAT,
SO IN A NUTSHELL,

06:30.000 --> 06:30.599
OKAY, GREAT,
SO IN A NUTSHELL,

06:30.599 --> 06:32.183
UM, DESCRIBE THE FOOD FOR ME.

06:32.183 --> 06:33.852
TRADITIONAL AMERICAN.

06:33.852 --> 06:36.354
OKAY. HOW OFTEN DOES IT CHANGE,
THE MENU?

06:36.354 --> 06:39.816
IT'S HASN'T
IN A VERY LONG TIME.
ONCE A YEAR.

06:39.816 --> 06:42.152
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU CHANGED THE LUNCH MENU?

06:42.152 --> 06:44.154
THE LUNCH MENU?
SEVERAL YEARS.

06:45.947 --> 06:47.157
WHEN DOES THE MENU CHANGE?

06:47.157 --> 06:48.783
<i>EVERY THREE MONTHS?</i>
<i>EVERY SIX MONTHS?</i>

06:48.783 --> 06:50.160
NO, MORE LIKE
EIGHT MONTHS TO A YEAR.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.911
EIGHT MONTHS TO A YEAR?
ONCE A YEAR.

06:51.911 --> 06:54.664
ONCE A YEAR, AND WHEN WAS
THE LAST BIG CHANGE?

06:54.664 --> 06:56.374
2 1/2 YEARS AGO.

06:56.374 --> 06:57.459
, NOW, RANDY,

06:57.459 --> 06:59.502
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA
HOW BAD THIS SOUNDS?

06:59.502 --> 07:00.000
OKAY, SO IN 33 YEARS,

07:00.000 --> 07:01.087
OKAY, SO IN 33 YEARS,

07:01.087 --> 07:06.259
THE MENU HAS CHANGED
NOT MANY TIMES, BUT IT HAS.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.428
OKAY, UH, RIGHT,
MORE IMPORTANTLY,

07:08.428 --> 07:09.763
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE PLACE?

07:09.763 --> 07:11.723
IT'S BEEN A REAL STRUGGLE
TO EVEN STAY OPEN.

07:11.723 --> 07:14.517
BUT I DON'T THINK
WE'D SURVIVE 33 YEARS,

07:14.517 --> 07:16.353
ESPECIALLY WITHOUT
TOO MUCH CHANGE,

07:16.353 --> 07:17.604
UNLESS THE FOOD WAS GOOD.

07:17.604 --> 07:18.647
GOOD. GLAD TO HEAR IT.

07:18.647 --> 07:20.315
UM, I'M DYING TO EAT.

07:20.315 --> 07:22.734
WHERE SHOULD I SIT?
WHEREVER YOU'D LIKE.

07:26.946 --> 07:29.699
WHAT'S ALL THAT STUFF
UP THERE?

07:29.699 --> 07:30.000
<i>ANTIQUES.</i>

07:30.000 --> 07:31.034
<i>ANTIQUES.</i>

07:31.034 --> 07:32.911
ANTIQUES? WOW.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.954
RANDY'S HOARDING--

07:34.954 --> 07:37.624
WELL, HE'S GOT
SOME SERIOUS DECOR ISSUES.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.876
THE ANTIQUE STUFF
AND EVERYTHING,

07:39.876 --> 07:40.877
IT NEEDS TO COME DOWN.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.504
LOOKS LIKE
A PILE OF JUNK.

07:42.504 --> 07:44.881
RIGHT.
ALEXA, I'M GONNA EAT.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.049
LET ME HAVE A GOOD LOOK
AT THE MENU,

07:46.049 --> 07:47.634
AND I LOOK FORWARD
TO CATCHING UP WITH YOU LATER.

07:47.634 --> 07:50.512
THANK YOU BOTH.
THANK YOU.

07:50.512 --> 07:53.723
HELLO, HOW ARE YOU?
HELLO, I'M GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?

07:53.723 --> 07:55.141
FIRST NAME IS?
KRISTEN.

07:55.141 --> 07:56.726
KRISTEN, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
I'LL BE YOUR SERVER TODAY.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.019
OKAY, GREAT.

07:58.019 --> 08:00.000
UM, WOW,
EVERYTHING'S SO DATED.
IT IS.

08:00.000 --> 08:00.271
UM, WOW,
EVERYTHING'S SO DATED.
IT IS.

08:00.271 --> 08:01.481
I MEAN, HAS ANYTHING CHANGED
IN HERE?

08:01.481 --> 08:04.234
NO, IT'S--I DON'T THINK
ANYTHING HAS CHANGED

08:04.234 --> 08:06.319
- SINCE THEY TOOK OVER.
<i>- WOW.</i>

08:06.319 --> 08:07.696
I WALKED IN,
AND THERE WAS A DREADFUL SMELL,

08:07.696 --> 08:09.572
AN OLD MUSTY, STINKY SMELL.
IT'S MUSTY.

08:09.572 --> 08:11.908
AND WHERE'S THAT SMELL COMING--
IS IT THESE ANTIQUES?

08:11.908 --> 08:13.993
UM, I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S THE ANTIQUES

08:13.993 --> 08:15.078
OR IF IT'S
THE OLD UPHOLSTERY.

08:15.078 --> 08:16.705
IF YOU SIT
IN ONE OF THESE BOOTHS,

08:16.705 --> 08:18.164
UM, IT SMELLS LIKE SOMEONE

08:18.164 --> 08:19.541
THAT HASN'T SHOWERED
IN A WHILE.

08:19.541 --> 08:21.126
SERIOUS?
YEAH, I'M SERIOUS.

08:21.126 --> 08:22.544
WHAT, LIKE SOMEONE'S--
<i>GO AHEAD AND SMELL IT.</i>

08:22.544 --> 08:24.337
SOMEONE'S, LIKE--
LIKE, B. O.?

08:24.337 --> 08:25.880
YEAH.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.215
OH, YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:28.383 --> 08:29.718
WHAT WAS--.

08:32.846 --> 08:33.888
YEAH, IT'S PRETTY BAD.

08:33.888 --> 08:34.931
WHEN I HAVE
TO SET THE TABLES,

08:34.931 --> 08:36.349
I SMELL IT ALL THE TIME, SO--

08:36.349 --> 08:37.559
THEY STINK.

08:37.559 --> 08:38.935
<i>IT SMELLS REALLY BAD.</i>

08:38.935 --> 08:40.520
HAVE THEY BEEN
REUPHOLSTERED?

08:40.520 --> 08:43.398
NO, I THINK THIS IS THE ORIGINAL
UPHOLSTERY FROM 1980.

08:43.398 --> 08:45.650
THAT'S A LOT OF FARTS
IN THESE CHAIRS.

08:45.650 --> 08:48.653
MAN, AND WHAT'S WITH THE WHEELS
ON THE CHAIRS?

08:48.653 --> 08:50.488
UM, BECAUSE IT'S CARPET,

08:50.488 --> 08:53.324
I THINK THEY THINK
IT'S CONVENIENT, 'CAUSE--

08:57.996 --> 08:59.414
MAN.

08:59.414 --> 09:00.000
UM, IS THIS THE MENU?

09:00.000 --> 09:00.623
UM, IS THIS THE MENU?

09:00.623 --> 09:02.333
THAT IS THE LUNCH MENU,
YEAH.

09:02.333 --> 09:03.376
LOOK AT THE STATE OF IT.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.544
AND I HAD TO PICK YOU OUT
THE BEST ONE.

09:04.544 --> 09:05.628
THAT'S THE BEST ONE?

09:05.628 --> 09:06.713
YEAH, THAT'S THE BEST ONE
I COULD FIND.

09:06.713 --> 09:07.964
WOW, AND THIS IS THE--

09:07.964 --> 09:09.549
YEAH, THIS IS
THE DINNER MENU.

09:09.549 --> 09:10.842
THE DINNER MENU?
YEP.

09:10.842 --> 09:13.344
WOW.
BRIE EN CROUTE.

09:13.344 --> 09:15.430
FRENCH ONION SOUP, WOW.

09:15.430 --> 09:17.348
NEW ORLEANS BARBECUE SHRIMP.

09:17.348 --> 09:19.642
CAJUN CATFISH,
MUSHROOM TEMPURA,

09:19.642 --> 09:21.352
BEEF WONTONS.

09:21.352 --> 09:25.231
WE'VE GONE FROM FRENCH
TO NEW ORLEANS TO ASIAN.

09:25.231 --> 09:26.691
WOW. ITALIAN.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.735
FLIES.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.000
FLIES EVERYWHERE,
WHERE ARE THEY COMING FROM?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.237
FLIES EVERYWHERE,
WHERE ARE THEY COMING FROM?

09:34.157 --> 09:35.700
THAT FLY WON'T
LEAVE YOU ALONE.

09:38.453 --> 09:40.371
MAN, ANYWAY...

09:40.371 --> 09:41.456
<i>SHALL I ORDER?</i>
OKAY.

09:41.456 --> 09:44.584
UH, LET'S GO FOR THE NEW ORLEANS
BARBECUE SHRIMP.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.002
<i>THANK YOU.</i>
OKAY.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.921
<i>THE YUCATAN SEA SCALLOPS.</i>
OKAY.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.422
AND IS THERE
A SALMON SPECIAL TODAY?

09:49.422 --> 09:51.341
THE SALMON SPECIAL TODAY
IS BAKED

09:51.341 --> 09:53.384
WITH A DILL DIJON CREAM SAUCE.

09:53.384 --> 09:55.178
OKAY, YEAH,
LET'S GO FOR THAT AS WELL.

09:55.178 --> 09:56.471
OKAY, DARLING,
I THINK WE'RE DONE FOR NOW.

09:56.471 --> 09:59.557
I'LL GO TURN THOSE IN
TO ALEXA.
THANK YOU.

10:01.184 --> 10:04.145
ORDER'S IN.
BRING IT ON.

10:04.145 --> 10:06.356
HOW ARE YOU?
MY NAME IS WILEY.

10:06.356 --> 10:08.024
WILEY, GOOD TO--
OH, THE SON.
THE SON, YES.

10:08.024 --> 10:09.484
OKAY, GREAT.
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE?

10:09.484 --> 10:10.652
I'VE BEEN HERE
ABOUT TEN YEARS.

10:10.652 --> 10:11.778
WHAT DO YOU THINK

10:11.778 --> 10:12.821
THE BIG PROBLEM
AT THE RESTAURANT IS?

10:12.821 --> 10:15.240
I THINK THE BIG PROBLEM
IS THE DECOR.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.367
HAVE YOU EVER TRIED TO TAKE
SOME OF THIS JUNK DOWN?

10:17.367 --> 10:18.576
<i>OH, I'M AFRAID TO.</i>

10:18.576 --> 10:19.577
<i>I'M AFRAID OF WHAT MY FATHER</i>

10:19.577 --> 10:21.162
<i>MIGHT DO IF I TRIED</i>
<i>TO TAKE SOMETHING DOWN.</i>

10:21.162 --> 10:23.164
WHY?
HE'S KEPT IT UP HERE
FOR 30 YEARS.

10:23.164 --> 10:24.624
YEAH, BUT IS IT
WORTH ANYTHING?

10:24.624 --> 10:26.668
I DOUBT IT.

10:26.668 --> 10:28.920
IT'S LIKE A GARAGE SALE THAT
YOU'RE STARING AT AND EATING AT.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.000
OH, YEAH.

10:30.000 --> 10:30.463
OH, YEAH.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.340
WELL, GOOD TO MEET YOU, BUD.
THANK YOU.
DEFINITELY.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.550
IT'S GREAT TO MEET YOU.
LIKEWISE.
GOOD TO SEE YOU TOO.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.343
<i>YOU TOO.</i>

10:35.343 --> 10:38.388
HERE'S YOUR BARBECUED SHRIMP.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.098
ALL RIGHT.

10:40.098 --> 10:41.349
MY DISHES ARE EXCELLENT,

10:41.349 --> 10:42.475
AND IF CHEF RAMSAY
DOESN'T LIKE

10:42.475 --> 10:45.061
ANY OF MY COOKING,
IT WILL PISS ME OFF.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.938
OOH, THIS IS WHAT?
BARBECUE SHRIMP.

10:46.938 --> 10:49.357
BARBECUE SHRIMP?
MM-HMM.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.651
<i>THAT'S A VERY</i>
<i>STRANGE-LOOKING BARBECUE SAUCE.</i>

10:51.651 --> 10:54.112
IT'S A CREAM--
BARBECUE CREAM SAUCE.

10:54.112 --> 10:55.822
<i>A BARBECUE CREAM SAUCE?</i>
CREAM SAUCE.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.490
<i>LOOK AT THE COLOR OF THAT.</i>

10:57.490 --> 10:59.534
IS THAT--
IS THE SHRIMP BARBECUE,

10:59.534 --> 11:00.000
OR IS IT THE SAUCE
THAT'S BARBECUE?

11:00.000 --> 11:00.827
OR IS IT THE SAUCE
THAT'S BARBECUE?

11:00.827 --> 11:03.037
IT'S A BARBECUE SAUCE.
OH, I SEE.

11:03.037 --> 11:05.331
AND WHY WOULD YOU SORT OF
COAT THE LEMON IN CREAM?

11:05.331 --> 11:07.000
IT'S, UH, COLLATERAL DAMAGE.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.459
YEAH, I'LL SAY.

11:08.459 --> 11:10.170
<i>THANK YOU, DARLING.</i>
YOU'RE WELCOME.

11:14.549 --> 11:16.134
AAH.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.721
UGH.

11:19.721 --> 11:22.390
ME.

11:22.390 --> 11:24.350
I WOULDN'T FEED THAT
TO THE  MANNEQUIN.

11:24.350 --> 11:27.353
<i>EVEN SHE'D MANAGE</i>
<i>TO THROW THAT UP.</i>

11:27.353 --> 11:29.689
THAT SAUCE IS HIDEOUS.

11:29.689 --> 11:30.000
AND THE SHRIMP FEELS
TOUGH AS OLD BOOTS.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.649
AND THE SHRIMP FEELS
TOUGH AS OLD BOOTS.

11:31.649 --> 11:32.817
AND THE FLIES
ARE LANDING ON ME,

11:32.817 --> 11:35.445
AS OPPOSED TO ON THE SHRIMP.

11:35.445 --> 11:37.363
THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

11:37.363 --> 11:40.158
NO, IT'S GOT
A REALLY WEIRD TEXTURE.

11:40.158 --> 11:41.326
WHEN A FLY BYPASSES
A  DISH,

11:41.326 --> 11:42.785
YOU KNOW IT'S BAD.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.412
TRUST ME.

11:44.412 --> 11:45.496
<i>UM, I'M DONE WITH THAT.</i>
<i>THANK YOU, DARLING.</i>
OKAY.

11:45.496 --> 11:49.167
THANKS, DARLING.
JEEZ.

11:51.336 --> 11:53.213
SO WHAT DID HE SAY
ABOUT THIS?

11:53.213 --> 11:55.423
UM, IT HAS A WEIRD TEXTURE
TO THE SAUCE.

11:55.423 --> 11:57.467
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHY
IT WOULD BE CALLED BARBECUE.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.677
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN COMING HERE
FOR 33 YEARS.

11:59.677 --> 12:00.000
THE FOOD CANNOT BE THAT BAD.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.056
THE FOOD CANNOT BE THAT BAD.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.641
OH.
THIS IS YOUR SALMON.

12:04.641 --> 12:06.309
WOW.

12:06.309 --> 12:07.352
THIS IS THE SPECIAL?

12:07.352 --> 12:09.103
YES, WITH THE DILL DIJON
CREAM SAUCE.

12:09.103 --> 12:10.480
WITH A DILL DIJON
CREAM SAUCE.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.232
SOMEBODY LIKES CREAM
IN THE KITCHEN.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.858
WHO IS THAT? WHERE DO ALL
THESE CREAM SAUCES COME FROM?

12:13.858 --> 12:15.902
I DON'T KNOW WHO ORIGINALLY
STARTED THEM,

12:15.902 --> 12:17.237
BUT ALEXA COOKS
WITH A LOT OF CREAM.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.447
WOW.
EVERYTHING'S MADE
WITH HEAVY CREAM.

12:19.447 --> 12:21.449
<i>AY-YI-YI.</i>

12:21.449 --> 12:23.409
WE HAVE--OH, THERE'S THE SALMON,
UNDER THERE.

12:23.409 --> 12:25.411
DAMN, A LOT
OF CREAM SAUCE.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.247
MM-HMM.
THANK YOU, DARLING.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.456
YOU'RE WELCOME.

12:34.337 --> 12:37.173
THE SALMON TASTES FROZEN.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.175
IT DOESN'T TASTE FRESH AT ALL.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.177
IT'S DRY, VERY DRY.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.388
WOW. I MEAN,
IT'S VERY OLD SCHOOL.

12:43.388 --> 12:44.514
CREAM ON CREAM ON CREAM.

12:44.514 --> 12:46.099
BUT THANK YOU, MY DARLING.
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.308
YEAH, THAT WASN'T PLEASANT.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.394
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL LET THEM KNOW.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.187
THAT WAS HIDEOUS.

12:51.187 --> 12:54.148
HE SAYS THE SALMON
TASTES DRY.

12:54.148 --> 12:56.109
WHAT? COME ON, REALLY?

12:56.109 --> 12:58.319
<i>HE SAID, "CREAM AGAIN?"</i>

12:58.319 --> 13:00.000
YEAH, WELL, EVERYTHING
HE ORDERED HAS CREAM, BUT--

13:00.000 --> 13:00.780
YEAH, WELL, EVERYTHING
HE ORDERED HAS CREAM, BUT--

13:00.780 --> 13:02.323
I KNOW, AND--
WOW, I WOULD THINK

13:02.323 --> 13:03.491
PEOPLE WOULD KNOW
WHAT THEY WERE ORDERING

13:03.491 --> 13:07.203
BEFORE THEY DID IT,
BUT THAT'S--WHATEVER.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.871
I THINK EVERYTHING
IS DELICIOUS.

13:08.871 --> 13:11.624
I WOULDN'T SERVE IF I DIDN'T
THINK IT WAS DELICIOUS.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.584
THERE GOES ANOTHER ONE.

13:15.837 --> 13:17.380
GOD, LOOK AT THAT WALLPAPER.

13:17.380 --> 13:19.257
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.345
WHAT A MESS.

13:24.345 --> 13:26.264
RANDY, WHEN THE LAST TIME
WE HAD A COAT OF PAINT

13:26.264 --> 13:28.099
OR CHANGED THE WALLPAPER?

13:28.099 --> 13:30.000
<i>WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME?</i>
THE LAST WALLPAPER?
FIVE YEARS AGO.

13:30.000 --> 13:30.226
<i>WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME?</i>
THE LAST WALLPAPER?
FIVE YEARS AGO.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.312
THIS WALLPAPER
IS FIVE YEARS AGO?

13:32.312 --> 13:35.231
NO, NOT THIS ONE.

13:35.231 --> 13:36.357
CAN I SHOW YOU SOMETHING?
SURE.

13:36.357 --> 13:37.358
PLEASE?

13:37.358 --> 13:39.277
WHAT'S ALL THIS HERE FOR?

13:39.277 --> 13:41.237
AND THIS HERE?

13:41.237 --> 13:42.530
DISREPAIR.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.198
AND YOU PULL THAT TABLE OUT,
AND YOU JUST SEE

13:44.198 --> 13:46.117
ALL THAT MARKING THERE,
ACROSS THE WALL LIKE THAT.

13:46.117 --> 13:48.494
THIS PLACE
LOOKS AND FEELS

13:48.494 --> 13:50.246
LIKE IT'S BEEN CLOSED
FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS.

13:50.246 --> 13:53.249
IT'S THE LOOK
THAT THE RESTAURANT HAS.

13:56.169 --> 13:59.839
WOW. HOPEFULLY,
BEFORE THE WEEK IS FINISHED,

13:59.839 --> 14:00.000
I'LL GET A STRAIGHT ANSWER.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.341
I'LL GET A STRAIGHT ANSWER.

14:02.341 --> 14:03.801
HERE IS YOUR YUCATAN SCALLOPS,
SIR.

14:03.801 --> 14:05.261
OH, HERE IT IS.
HERE HE IS.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.512
WILEY.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.139
THERE YOU GO, CHEF.
THE MAN.

14:08.139 --> 14:09.766
AND WHERE ARE THE SCALLOPS?

14:09.766 --> 14:10.850
IN THE DISH.
INSIDE THAT BOAT.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.852
UNDERNEATH THE PEPPERS AND--
IN THE BOAT.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.187
YES.
EXCELLENT, THANK YOU.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.230
YOU'RE WELCOME.

14:16.230 --> 14:19.025
WOW, IT IS ABSOLUTELY GROSS.

14:21.235 --> 14:24.238
WOW, DREADFUL.

14:24.238 --> 14:25.615
NO SEASONING WHATSOEVER.

14:25.615 --> 14:28.326
AND THE SCALLOPS
ARE JUST HIDEOUS.

14:28.326 --> 14:30.000
I GOTTA FIND OUT
WHY THIS IS CALLED YUCATAN.

14:30.000 --> 14:30.411
I GOTTA FIND OUT
WHY THIS IS CALLED YUCATAN.

14:30.411 --> 14:33.206
'CAUSE I DON'T WANNA INSULT
THOSE PEOPLE IN MEXICO.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.249
RANDY, UM,
I'D LIKE TO FIND OUT

14:35.249 --> 14:38.961
WHY IT'S CALLED "THE YUCATAN,"
THE SEA SCALLOP DISH.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.088
WHAT'S THE RELATION?

14:40.088 --> 14:43.925
THE SPICE
WITH THE CHIPOTLE PEPPERS.

14:43.925 --> 14:46.302
SO WHY'S
IT CALLED YUCATAN?

14:46.302 --> 14:48.846
'CAUSE IT'S GOT SPICE IN IT?
IT'S JUST THE NAME.

14:48.846 --> 14:51.099
YOU JUST PICKED THE NAME
OUT OF A HAT?

14:51.099 --> 14:52.642
<i>IT BEARS NO RELEVANCE</i>
<i>TO THE ACTUAL--</i>

14:52.642 --> 14:57.021
IF IT DOES OR DOESN'T,
I'M NOT ACTUALLY 100% SURE.

14:59.315 --> 15:00.000
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.359
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

15:03.945 --> 15:06.155
OKAY, I'M DONE WITH THAT.
THANK YOU.

15:08.199 --> 15:09.575
THAT WAS GROSS.

15:09.575 --> 15:12.411
THE SCALLOPS ARE OVERDONE,
AND THE SAUCE IS BLAND.

15:12.411 --> 15:13.871
THAT'S THE WAY
I'VE BEEN COOKING 'EM.

15:13.871 --> 15:16.791
THEY LOOK BEAUTIFUL.
THEY WERE COOKED PERFECTLY.

15:16.791 --> 15:18.334
I KNOW THEY WERE.

15:18.334 --> 15:20.169
I'M GETTING IRRITATED.

15:20.169 --> 15:21.379
I LIKE IT.

15:21.379 --> 15:22.964
IT'S AN ABSOLUTE MATTER
OF TASTE.

15:22.964 --> 15:26.384
THIS IS JUST
STUPID.

15:26.384 --> 15:29.470
THAT'S THE WAY WE COOK.
THAT'S--

15:29.470 --> 15:30.000
THAT'S--
IT WASN'T AN OFF DAY.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.055
THAT'S--
IT WASN'T AN OFF DAY.

15:42.941 --> 15:46.152
AFTER SAMPLING SOME UNUSUAL
AND DISGUSTING FOOD...

15:46.152 --> 15:47.987
IT'S GOT
A REALLY WEIRD TEXTURE.

15:47.987 --> 15:50.615
WHILE SITTING IN A MUSTY,
BUG-FILLED DINING ROOM...

15:50.615 --> 15:52.200
FLIES EVERYWHERE,
WHERE ARE THEY COMING FROM?

15:52.200 --> 15:54.369
CHEF RAMSAY WANTS
TO HAVE A LITTLE CHAT

15:54.369 --> 15:57.205
WITH HEAD CHEF AND OWNER ALEXA
AND HER KITCHEN STAFF.

15:57.205 --> 15:58.623
<i>I'M GONNA GET</i>
<i>STRAIGHT TO THE POINT.</i>

15:58.623 --> 16:00.375
I'M SERIOUSLY CONCERNED.

16:00.375 --> 16:03.420
UM, THE NEW ORLEANS
BARBECUED SHRIMP--

16:03.420 --> 16:06.297
I'VE NEVER KNOWN A BARBECUE
CREAM SAUCE, ANYWHERE.

16:06.297 --> 16:07.895
YUCATAN SEA SCALLOPS--
NO SEASONING.

16:07.895 --> 16:09.175
YUCATAN SEA SCALLOPS--
NO SEASONING.

16:09.175 --> 16:11.010
THE SCALLOPS
WERE MEATY, BLAND,

16:11.010 --> 16:13.930
AND ACTUALLY WHITER
THAN THE ACTUAL CREAM SAUCE.

16:13.930 --> 16:16.975
DO YOU, UH, TASTE ANYTHING
THAT YOU'RE COOKING?

16:16.975 --> 16:19.060
I DIDN'T SEE
ANYTHING SEASONED.

16:19.060 --> 16:20.019
I'M SORRY,
I HAVE A LOT OF PRIDE.

16:20.019 --> 16:21.312
AND I COOKED EVERYTHING THERE.

16:21.312 --> 16:23.148
<i>AND I REALLY, YOU KNOW--</i>

16:23.148 --> 16:25.316
A LOT OF PEOPLE ENJOY
THE THINGS THAT WE COOK.

16:25.316 --> 16:29.070
<i>RIGHT. I'M NOT ASKING</i>
<i>ABOUT YOUR PRIDE.</i>

16:29.070 --> 16:30.488
THE QUESTION I ASKED WAS,

16:30.488 --> 16:31.948
"DOES ANYONE TASTE..."
YES.

16:31.948 --> 16:34.325
"AS THEY COOK?"
SO ALL MY FOOD--

16:34.325 --> 16:37.162
I DIDN'T TASTE YOUR FOOD.
YOU DIDN'T TASTE MY FOOD?

16:37.162 --> 16:37.895
NO, BUT I COOK THAT FOOD
ALL THE TIME, I DON'T KNOW.

16:37.895 --> 16:39.080
NO, BUT I COOK THAT FOOD
ALL THE TIME, I DON'T KNOW.

16:39.080 --> 16:40.123
OH, SO IT'S JUST AUTOMATIC?

16:40.123 --> 16:41.958
PUSH THE BUTTON,
AND WE'RE COOKING THAT.

16:41.958 --> 16:43.960
SO YOU DON'T THINK
ANYTHING NEEDS SEASONING?

16:43.960 --> 16:45.170
I THOUGHT I WAS
MAKING GOOD FOOD.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.713
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY.

16:46.713 --> 16:48.757
<i>THE FOOD IS DATED,</i>

16:48.757 --> 16:50.425
THE DECOR IS HIDEOUS,

16:50.425 --> 16:52.260
<i>AND YOU SIT CUSTOMERS</i>

16:52.260 --> 16:54.971
IN FRONT OF A  WALL
WITH DILAPIDATED WALLPAPER,

16:54.971 --> 16:57.182
PEELING OFF!

16:57.182 --> 17:00.143
<i>YOU BETTER TAKE A GOOD LOOK</i>
<i>AT YOURSELF</i>

17:00.143 --> 17:01.978
AND MAYBE DUST YOURSELF DOWN.

17:01.978 --> 17:05.231
SHAKE IT OFF.

17:08.902 --> 17:12.197
THAT  FREAK
IN THE CORNER THERE, MAN.

17:17.076 --> 17:18.953
STOP.

17:18.953 --> 17:21.998
LET'S GO GET READY
FOR DINNER.

17:28.421 --> 17:30.924
WORD HAS SPREAD
THAT CHEF RAMSAY IS IN TOWN...

17:30.924 --> 17:32.050
<i>HELLO.</i>

17:32.050 --> 17:33.009
AND THE RESTAURANT THAT IS

17:33.009 --> 17:34.761
NORMALLY NOT VERY BUSY...
RIGHT THIS WAY.

17:34.761 --> 17:35.762
IS BOOKED.

17:35.762 --> 17:37.895
FOR YOU, SIR?

17:37.895 --> 17:38.598
FOR YOU, SIR?

17:38.598 --> 17:41.601
TONIGHT, CHEF RAMSAY
WILL CONTINUE TO EXAMINE

17:41.601 --> 17:44.354
THE DYSFUNCTIONAL WORKING
OF THIS RESTAURANT.

17:44.354 --> 17:45.396
UH, JEEZ.

17:45.396 --> 17:48.399
WHAT'S ALL THIS
HERE FOR?

17:51.736 --> 17:53.488
HELLO, CHEF.
DO PEOPLE, UH--

17:53.488 --> 17:54.906
DOES ANYONE ACTUALLY
SIT DOWN HERE?

17:54.906 --> 17:56.908
THEY DO, YES.
THEY DO, YEAH?

17:56.908 --> 17:58.660
AND WHEN YOU, UH--

17:58.660 --> 18:00.578
WHEN THEY SIT ON THIS,

18:00.578 --> 18:03.081
DO YOU NOT THINK
THIS LOOKS DRAB?

18:03.081 --> 18:05.041
I DON'T HAVE
A BETTER ONE.

18:05.041 --> 18:06.084
YOU DON'T HAVE
A BETTER ONE.

18:06.084 --> 18:07.895
HOW ABOUT NOTHING?

18:07.895 --> 18:09.254
HOW ABOUT NOTHING?

18:14.050 --> 18:16.469
WHAT IS THAT?

18:16.469 --> 18:20.723
WOW.
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

18:20.723 --> 18:21.933
WHAT IS THIS?

18:21.933 --> 18:23.768
I MEAN, HONESTLY.

18:23.768 --> 18:24.978
WHEN WAS THIS CLEANED?

18:24.978 --> 18:26.229
NOT FOR A LONG TIME, SIR.

18:26.229 --> 18:28.481
YOU ARE IN CHARGE
OF FRONT OF HOUSE, RIGHT?

18:28.481 --> 18:29.899
I AM.
OH, MY GOD.

18:29.899 --> 18:31.651
THERE YOU GO,
THERE'S YOUR CARD.

18:31.651 --> 18:35.446
THE JOKER.
HOW FITTING IS THAT?

18:35.446 --> 18:37.895
- HOW OLD IS THIS CHAIR?
<i>- 20 YEARS.</i>

18:37.895 --> 18:38.032
- HOW OLD IS THIS CHAIR?
<i>- 20 YEARS.</i>

18:38.032 --> 18:39.868
20 YEARS?
20 YEARS.

18:39.868 --> 18:42.078
WHAT KIND OF MESSAGE
DOES IT SEND WHEN YOU

18:42.078 --> 18:44.122
HAVE THIS IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE DINING ROOM?

18:44.122 --> 18:45.915
I MEAN, THAT DOES LOOK
LIKE IT'S GONE

18:45.915 --> 18:48.126
PAST ITS SELL-BY DATE,
RIGHT?
YES.

18:48.126 --> 18:50.170
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
IT WAS CLEANED?

18:50.170 --> 18:51.963
I WOULD SAY
A COUPLE YEARS AGO.

18:51.963 --> 18:54.340
OH, MY GOD.

18:54.340 --> 18:56.551
HAVE YOU SEEN DOWN THERE?
<i>YES.</i>

18:56.551 --> 18:57.760
AND THAT'S ACCEPTABLE
FOR YOU?

18:57.760 --> 19:00.013
THAT'S NOT CLEAN, SIR, NO.

19:00.013 --> 19:01.598
OH, MY GOD.

19:01.598 --> 19:03.850
YOU ARE KIDDING ME.

19:03.850 --> 19:05.393
OH, NO, WHAT IS THAT?

19:05.393 --> 19:07.312
LOOKS LIKE A COMB.

19:07.312 --> 19:07.895
LOOKS LIKE A COMB?

19:07.895 --> 19:08.938
LOOKS LIKE A COMB?

19:08.938 --> 19:10.481
OH, COME ON, RANDY.

19:10.481 --> 19:11.774
DO YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY,
IN FRONT OF THE CUSTOMERS?

19:11.774 --> 19:12.942
NOT AT ALL.

19:12.942 --> 19:14.861
THE CRUMBS
AND THE  DOWN THERE.

19:14.861 --> 19:16.404
YOU'RE NOT PUTTING IT
BACK THERE, ARE YOU?

19:16.404 --> 19:17.530
NO, I'LL TAKE IT OUT--

19:17.530 --> 19:19.782
YEAH, GET IT THE
OUT OF HERE.

19:19.782 --> 19:22.911
I GOTTA WASH
MY FRICKIN' HANDS.

19:24.579 --> 19:26.372
I WASN'T TOTALLY
FLABBERGASTED.

19:26.372 --> 19:28.166
THE TRASH FELL OUT
OF SOMEBODY'S POCKET.

19:28.166 --> 19:29.834
SOMEBODY DIDN'T
SEE IT WAS THERE.

19:29.834 --> 19:31.920
YOU KNOW, I DON'T FEEL
THAT BAD ABOUT THAT.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.755
UGH, I'M COVERED IN DUST.

19:38.801 --> 19:41.888
<i>OH, MY GOD, WHAT A MESS.</i>

19:41.888 --> 19:45.975
THERE ARE RAT DROPPINGS
EVERYWHERE.

19:45.975 --> 19:48.603
GROSS.

19:48.603 --> 19:51.814
OH, THIS IS SHOCKING.

19:51.814 --> 19:55.652
YOU KEEP YOUR DIRTY SHOES
UNDER THE BANQUETTE?

19:55.652 --> 19:57.862
THEY'RE NOT MINE.
DID THE CUSTOMER DIE?

19:57.862 --> 20:00.240
THERE'S HOLES IN THE SOLE.

20:00.240 --> 20:03.576
DIRTY, CRUSTY SHOES.
UGH.

20:03.576 --> 20:05.912
I GOTTA WASH MY HANDS AGAIN.

20:05.912 --> 20:07.038
MAN.

20:07.038 --> 20:07.895
OKAY, ONION RINGS.

20:07.895 --> 20:09.082
OKAY, ONION RINGS.

20:09.082 --> 20:11.251
DID WE FIX THOSE?
ARE THEY ALREADY OUT?

20:11.251 --> 20:12.543
WHAT'S THAT?

20:12.543 --> 20:14.337
<i>IT'S FROM THE STEAM TABLE.</i>

20:14.337 --> 20:16.297
LOOKS LIKE A RIVER
RUNNING THROUGH HERE.

20:16.297 --> 20:17.924
<i>GOD, LOOK AT THE STATE</i>
<i>OF THIS STOVE.</i>

20:17.924 --> 20:18.967
<i>HOW OLD IS THAT STOVE?</i>

20:18.967 --> 20:20.426
<i>33 YEARS OLD.</i>

20:20.426 --> 20:21.761
WOW, I MEAN,
I KNOW THE RESTAURANT'S

20:21.761 --> 20:23.304
CALLED THE OLD NEIGHBORHOOD,
BUT, LIKE,

20:23.304 --> 20:25.473
THE KITCHEN'S AN OLD,
DILAPIDATED NEIGHBORHOOD, YEAH?

20:25.473 --> 20:27.475
WHAT IS THAT?
IS THAT YOUR--

20:27.475 --> 20:30.186
WOW, YOU ARE KIDDING ME.

20:30.186 --> 20:31.688
HE STICKS IT
IN THE PRIME RIB,

20:31.688 --> 20:36.567
THEN HE STICKS IT
BACK IN THERE.

20:36.567 --> 20:37.652
<i>WHAT'S THAT SPRAY?</i>

20:37.652 --> 20:37.895
CANNED COATING,
SO IT DOESN'T STICK.

20:37.895 --> 20:39.904
CANNED COATING,
SO IT DOESN'T STICK.

20:39.904 --> 20:41.906
CANNED COATING?
YES.

20:41.906 --> 20:44.033
<i>WOW.</i>

20:44.033 --> 20:46.744
MY MOTHER'S DEFINITELY
LOST HER HIGH STANDARDS

20:46.744 --> 20:48.705
OVER THE LAST 15, 20 YEARS.

20:48.705 --> 20:50.832
HERE YOU GO, RANDY.
THANKS.

20:50.832 --> 20:52.375
I KNOW SHE CARES
FOR THIS PLACE.

20:52.375 --> 20:54.252
BUT THE PASSION
AND THE FIRE

20:54.252 --> 20:56.838
THAT I'VE SEEN IN HER BEFORE
IS NO LONGER THERE.

20:56.838 --> 20:59.841
OKAY, FILET, FILET,
LAMB CHOPS.

20:59.841 --> 21:01.467
I PROBABLY BURNED 'EM.

21:01.467 --> 21:03.011
SON OF A BITCH.

21:03.011 --> 21:05.096
WHAT IS THIS IN HERE?
THIS IS THE OFFICE.

21:05.096 --> 21:06.347
<i>WOW.</i>

21:06.347 --> 21:07.895
<i>HOW COULD ANYONE WORK</i>
<i>IN THIS MESS?</i>

21:07.895 --> 21:08.641
<i>HOW COULD ANYONE WORK</i>
<i>IN THIS MESS?</i>

21:08.641 --> 21:11.227
<i>DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?</i>
<i>IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.</i>

21:11.227 --> 21:13.479
WHAT THE--GOD.

21:13.479 --> 21:16.357
WHAT?
WHAT IS ALL THIS JUNK?

21:16.357 --> 21:17.859
OLD EQUIPMENT.

21:17.859 --> 21:19.569
BUT WHAT'S IT HERE FOR?
PARTS, ONCE IN A WHILE.

21:19.569 --> 21:21.821
PARTS?

21:21.821 --> 21:26.534
SO WHAT PARTS DO YOU TAKE
FROM A 1950s ICE MACHINE?

21:26.534 --> 21:28.953
LEGS.
LEGS?

21:28.953 --> 21:30.955
AND WHAT'S THIS?
OH, IT'S A MICROWAVE.

21:30.955 --> 21:33.249
DOES IT WORK?
UH, NO.

21:33.249 --> 21:35.001
SO WHAT CAN YOU
TAKE FROM THAT THEN?

21:35.001 --> 21:36.836
I DON'T KNOW.
WOW.

21:36.836 --> 21:37.895
LOOK AT THE MESS.

21:37.895 --> 21:37.962
LOOK AT THE MESS.

21:37.962 --> 21:39.714
IT'S LIKE
YOU'RE HOARDING STUFF.

21:39.714 --> 21:41.674
CHEF RAMSAY MUST
THINK I'M A LUNATIC

21:41.674 --> 21:43.551
FOR HAVING THAT STUFF
SITTING BACK THERE,

21:43.551 --> 21:46.346
BUT I DON'T REALLY THINK
THAT I'M A HOARDER.

21:46.346 --> 21:47.805
IT'S JUST HARD FOR ME
TO THROW THINGS AWAY.

21:49.307 --> 21:52.769
WHAT'S THAT NOISE
COMING FROM?

21:52.769 --> 21:55.104
<i>SOMETHING DOESN'T</i>
<i>SOUND RIGHT IN THERE.</i>

21:56.689 --> 21:58.524
OH,  ALMIGHTY.

21:58.524 --> 22:00.026
NEXT TO CLEANING EQUIPMENT.

22:00.026 --> 22:01.361
HOW LONG HAS THAT
BEEN THERE?

22:01.361 --> 22:02.612
I DON'T KNOW.

22:02.612 --> 22:04.447
IT WAS NOT
IN THERE YESTERDAY.

22:04.447 --> 22:06.866
SO IT DIED
ONLY AS OF THIS MORNING.

22:06.866 --> 22:07.895
THAT DRY?

22:07.895 --> 22:10.370
THAT DRY?

22:10.370 --> 22:13.456
CAN WE COME OUT OF THERE?

22:13.456 --> 22:17.835
THAT--THAT DIED A LOT LONGER
THAN 24 HOURS AGO.

22:17.835 --> 22:20.213
MATT, TAKE OVER FROM ALEXA
FOR ONE MINUTE, PLEASE.

22:20.213 --> 22:21.464
<i>I GOT IT.</i>

22:21.464 --> 22:23.758
HAVE YOU SEEN OUT HERE?
I KNOW.

22:23.758 --> 22:26.844
HE HAS A PROBLEM WITH THROWING
AWAY, CLEARLY.

22:26.844 --> 22:28.888
AND ARE YOU OKAY
WITH THIS THEN?
NO.

22:28.888 --> 22:30.556
YOU'RE NOT?
NO, IT NEEDS TO GO.

22:30.556 --> 22:31.724
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

22:31.724 --> 22:34.519
I'M TRYING TO GET HIM,
SLOWLY, TO GET RID OF IT

22:34.519 --> 22:36.646
AND TO CHANGE HIS WAYS,
BUT HE DOESN'T LISTEN.

22:36.646 --> 22:37.895
IT'S A PROBLEM.
IT'S A BIG ISSUE.

22:37.895 --> 22:38.272
IT'S A PROBLEM.
IT'S A BIG ISSUE.

22:38.272 --> 22:39.607
YOU'RE ENABLING A HOARDER.

22:39.607 --> 22:40.858
YOU'RE RIGHT,
IT IS A PROBLEM.

22:40.858 --> 22:42.402
IT'S A HOARDER, I AGREE.

22:42.402 --> 22:44.070
AND THAT, AS AN OFFICE,
IN THERE?

22:44.070 --> 22:48.199
IT'S--IT'S A TRAVESTY,
ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS.

22:48.199 --> 22:49.575
AH, GOTTA WASH MY HANDS.

22:49.575 --> 22:51.285
THAT'S ALL I'VE DONE
FOR THE LAST 20 MINUTES,

22:51.285 --> 22:53.579
I'VE WASHED
MY FRICKIN' HANDS.

22:53.579 --> 22:55.581
WHILE IT IS CLEAR
TO CHEF RAMSAY

22:55.581 --> 22:57.500
THAT RANDY IS A HOARDER...

22:57.500 --> 22:58.626
<i>WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT,</i>
<i>KRISTEN?</i>

22:58.626 --> 23:00.420
THE BAKED POTATO IS FOAMING
BECAUSE THERE'S

23:00.420 --> 23:02.672
SO MUCH BUTTER ON IT
WITH THE SOUR CREAM.
GROSS.

23:02.672 --> 23:04.757
IT'S ALSO BECOMING EVIDENT
THAT CUSTOMERS

23:04.757 --> 23:07.009
ARE AS DISAPPOINTED
WITH THEIR FOOD

23:07.009 --> 23:07.895
AS HE WAS EARLIER TODAY
AT LUNCH.

23:07.895 --> 23:08.428
AS HE WAS EARLIER TODAY
AT LUNCH.

23:08.428 --> 23:10.346
<i>THE SPLIT-TOP CAME BACK.</i>

23:10.346 --> 23:11.514
HE SAYS IT WAS TOUGH.

23:11.514 --> 23:13.307
<i>THAT'S RIDICULOUS.</i>
I KNOW.

23:13.307 --> 23:15.143
<i>HE DIDN'T LIKE</i>
<i>THE POTATO CAKE EITHER.</i>

23:16.352 --> 23:17.937
NOW HE DECIDES

23:17.937 --> 23:21.149
TO SEE WHAT IS LURKING
IN THE WALK-IN FRIDGE.

23:23.651 --> 23:27.029
WHAT IS THAT?

23:27.029 --> 23:28.030
MY GOD.

23:28.030 --> 23:31.284
THAT STINKS.
THAT'S GONE OFF.

23:31.284 --> 23:34.203
RAW CHICKEN AND COOKED MEAT.

23:34.203 --> 23:35.455
I AM NOT IMPRESSED.

23:35.455 --> 23:37.895
THEY HAVE BROKEN
EVERY CARDINAL RULE.

23:37.895 --> 23:38.708
THEY HAVE BROKEN
EVERY CARDINAL RULE.

23:46.964 --> 23:48.966
IT'S BARELY AN HOUR
INTO DINNER SERVICE

23:48.966 --> 23:50.426
AT THE OLD NEIGHBORHOOD.

23:51.635 --> 23:52.803
THE RESTAURANT IS ALREADY FULL

23:52.803 --> 23:54.638
OF UNHAPPY CUSTOMERS.

23:54.638 --> 23:57.141
THE BAKED POTATO IS FOAMING
BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH BUTTER

23:57.141 --> 23:58.892
ON IT WITH THE SOUR CREAM.
GROSS.

23:58.892 --> 24:00.227
AND CHEF RAMSAY
HAS NOT ONLY MADE

24:00.227 --> 24:02.312
SOME SHOCKING DISCOVERIES
IN THE DINING ROOM...

24:02.312 --> 24:03.522
OH, MY GOD.

24:03.522 --> 24:05.524
BUT BACK IN THE KITCHEN,
HE HAS MADE

24:05.524 --> 24:07.443
SOME FRIGHTENING DISCOVERIES
AS WELL.

24:07.443 --> 24:09.445
WHAT IS THAT?

24:11.447 --> 24:12.531
MY GOD.

24:12.531 --> 24:13.005
THAT STINKS.
THAT'S GONE OFF.

24:13.005 --> 24:15.701
THAT STINKS.
THAT'S GONE OFF.

24:15.701 --> 24:18.162
MY GOD, THAT'S DISGUSTING.

24:19.455 --> 24:22.291
UGH, THAT IS OFF AS WELL.

24:22.291 --> 24:24.418
SALMON, AND LOOK,

24:24.418 --> 24:26.378
SOME DIRTY
PICKED ALL THE BONES OUT

24:26.378 --> 24:28.380
AND JUST LEFT THEM
ON THE SIDE.

24:28.380 --> 24:30.382
WHAT A WAY TO RUN A FRIDGE.

24:30.382 --> 24:32.426
THAT STINKS.

24:32.426 --> 24:36.722
SO THE HOARDING ISN'T JUST
WASH MACHINES AND MICROWAVES.

24:36.722 --> 24:39.433
IT'S OLD FOOD.

24:39.433 --> 24:43.005
UGH,  LOOK
AT THE STATE OF THIS.

24:43.005 --> 24:44.229
UGH,  LOOK
AT THE STATE OF THIS.

24:44.229 --> 24:45.564
DIRTY, DIRTY.

24:45.564 --> 24:48.358
OH, WONDERFUL.
WE SURVIVED IT.

24:48.358 --> 24:49.401
NOPE.

24:49.401 --> 24:52.404
WHAT IN THE  IS THIS?

24:52.404 --> 24:55.574
MUD PIE ON TOP OF SCALLOPS.

24:55.574 --> 24:58.702
MAN, THIS FRIDGE
IS LITTERED WITH.

25:01.914 --> 25:04.750
THIS IS A HORROR SHOW.

25:08.504 --> 25:11.048
RANDY, CAN YOU JUST
GET ME LEXI, PLEASE,

25:11.048 --> 25:12.132
FOR TWO MINUTES?

25:12.132 --> 25:13.005
SHE'S EXTREMELY BUSY
RIGHT NOW, BUT--

25:13.005 --> 25:13.759
SHE'S EXTREMELY BUSY
RIGHT NOW, BUT--

25:13.759 --> 25:15.969
YEAH, WELL, I'M EXTREMELY--
I UNDERSTAND, I'LL GET HER.

25:15.969 --> 25:17.846
UH, WILEY, CAN YOU
STAY WITH ME?

25:17.846 --> 25:19.389
TWO SECONDS.
YES.

25:19.389 --> 25:22.518
LEX, CHEF HAS TO HAVE YOU
FOR A MINUTE RIGHT NOW.

25:22.518 --> 25:24.770
OKAY.

25:24.770 --> 25:29.399
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
THIS WALK-IN FRIDGE WAS CLEANED?

25:29.399 --> 25:31.485
UH, MONDAY.
MONDAY?

25:31.485 --> 25:33.487
CAN YOU JUST STEP OVER HERE,
TWO SECONDS?
YEAH.

25:33.487 --> 25:36.448
THIS IS THE DESSERT
START PREPARATION.

25:36.448 --> 25:40.035
IT'S GOT BLOOD.
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

25:40.035 --> 25:42.913
- AND THESE?
<i>- LAMB CHOPS.</i>

25:42.913 --> 25:43.005
AND WHAT'S IT SAT IN?

25:43.005 --> 25:45.457
AND WHAT'S IT SAT IN?

25:45.457 --> 25:46.792
WHAT IS THAT?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

25:46.792 --> 25:48.126
COLD WATER, DIRTY WATER,
ABSOLUTELY.

25:48.126 --> 25:49.461
<i>DIRTY WATER, YOU'RE RIGHT.</i>

25:49.461 --> 25:51.296
AND THIS HERE?
WHAT IS THAT?

25:51.296 --> 25:52.923
<i>FUDGE FROM THE MUD PIE.</i>

25:52.923 --> 25:55.008
FUDGE FROM THE MUD PIE

25:55.008 --> 25:56.426
<i>THAT SAT ON TOP</i>
<i>OF A LEG OF LAMB</i>

25:56.426 --> 25:58.512
<i>THAT IS DRIPPING WITH BLOOD--</i>
<i>YOU WITH ME?</i>

25:58.512 --> 26:01.139
THE PLACE IS LITTERED
WITH ,

26:01.139 --> 26:02.975
<i>EVERYWHERE YOU TURN.</i>

26:02.975 --> 26:04.351
<i>AND FOR ME,</i>
<i>IT WAS BAD ENOUGH</i>

26:04.351 --> 26:06.186
TO SEE THE CRAP
IN THE DINING ROOM.

26:06.186 --> 26:09.398
I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT WALK-IN

26:09.398 --> 26:11.233
<i>TO BE FESTERING</i>
<i>THE WAY IT IS.</i>

26:11.233 --> 26:13.005
<i>GO AND HAVE A LOOK</i>
<i>IN THERE NOW.</i>

26:13.005 --> 26:13.193
<i>GO AND HAVE A LOOK</i>
<i>IN THERE NOW.</i>

26:13.193 --> 26:14.444
BOTH OF YOU,
WALK IN THERE.

26:14.444 --> 26:17.489
MOLD, CRAP.

26:17.489 --> 26:20.534
THAT WAS CLEANED LAST WEEK?

26:20.534 --> 26:22.327
IT WAS NOT
CLEANED LAST WEEK.

26:22.327 --> 26:24.580
AND THIS HERE,
CAN YOU SEE THAT UP THERE?

26:24.580 --> 26:25.747
I CAN SEE THAT.

26:25.747 --> 26:28.750
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
SERIOUSLY?

26:28.750 --> 26:31.086
JUST SMELL THAT.

26:32.337 --> 26:35.674
LOOK AT THE COLOR OF IT
AND THE CONGEALED BLOOD.

26:35.674 --> 26:39.261
AND THIS?
THAT'S BLOOD FROM THE LAMB.

26:39.261 --> 26:42.389
I'VE NEVER, EVER SEEN
A PACK THIS BAD.

26:42.389 --> 26:43.005
AND THEN SOME DIRTY

26:43.005 --> 26:44.266
AND THEN SOME DIRTY

26:44.266 --> 26:46.143
TAKES BONES
FROM THE SALMON

26:46.143 --> 26:47.644
AND DUMPS THEM ON THE SIDE.

26:47.644 --> 26:49.771
I DID IT.
YOU DID THIS?

26:49.771 --> 26:51.440
I WAS PULLING 'EM OUT.
YEP, I DID.

26:51.440 --> 26:53.150
AND YOU PUT THEM
BACK ON THERE--

26:53.150 --> 26:55.485
I SAT 'EM THERE,
AND I DIDN'T PUT 'EM AWAY.

26:55.485 --> 26:58.363
OH, MY GOD, JUST TOUCH
THE TEMPERATURE OF THAT.

26:58.363 --> 26:59.448
JUST TOUCH THAT.

26:59.448 --> 27:02.326
THE BIG SHOCK FOR ME--
HOLD THEM BOTH.

27:02.326 --> 27:03.827
IT SAT WITH THIS.

27:03.827 --> 27:07.331
YOU HAVE RAW CHICKEN
AND COOKED  MEAT.

27:07.331 --> 27:08.957
<i>THERE'S A THEME HERE.</i>

27:08.957 --> 27:11.126
<i>THIS PLACE</i>
<i>IS LITTERED WITH JUNK,</i>

27:11.126 --> 27:13.005
THE CHAIRS ARE CAKED
IN ,

27:13.005 --> 27:13.086
THE CHAIRS ARE CAKED
IN ,

27:13.086 --> 27:16.965
AND THE REFRIGERATION
WALK-IN IS IN DISARRAY.

27:16.965 --> 27:19.968
I STEPPED ONE FOOT
INTO YOUR KITCHEN,

27:19.968 --> 27:22.262
AND THERE WAS A
HOLE IN THE WALL,

27:22.262 --> 27:24.264
WHERE THE MEAT THERMOMETERS

27:24.264 --> 27:26.058
GETS TAKEN OUT
AND STUCK INSIDE.

27:26.058 --> 27:27.434
THERE'S A FREEZER THERE
THAT'S NOT EVEN

27:27.434 --> 27:30.228
UP TO THE TEMP OF A FRIDGE,
LET ALONE A FREEZER.

27:30.228 --> 27:32.314
AND YOU'VE GOT COOKED MEAT,
RAW MEAT,

27:32.314 --> 27:35.275
AND  DESSERTS GLAZED,

27:35.275 --> 27:38.528
AND HALF COOKED
LEG OF LAMB BLOOD.

27:38.528 --> 27:40.697
<i>THIS IS CRIMINAL.</i>

27:40.697 --> 27:42.324
YOU HAVE CROSS-CONTAMINATED

27:42.324 --> 27:43.005
EVERY OUNCE OF INGREDIENTS
IN THIS KITCHEN.

27:43.005 --> 27:47.245
EVERY OUNCE OF INGREDIENTS
IN THIS KITCHEN.

27:47.245 --> 27:49.623
AND YOU--YOU SEE THAT?

27:49.623 --> 27:52.501
WHO IS HOARDING
ALL THIS?

27:52.501 --> 27:55.170
WE SERVE THAT.

27:55.170 --> 27:57.923
YOU USE THAT?

27:57.923 --> 28:00.592
WILEY, GET IN THERE
AND STOP

28:00.592 --> 28:03.220
ANY OTHER  ENTREE
LEAVING,

28:03.220 --> 28:05.263
AND SHUT IT  DOWN.

28:14.605 --> 28:16.691
AFTER WITNESSING
ONE OF THE WORST KITCHENS

28:16.691 --> 28:19.026
HE HAS EVER SEEN...
OH, MY GOD.

28:19.026 --> 28:21.070
THIS IS A HORROR SHOW.

28:21.070 --> 28:24.448
STOP ANY OTHER  ENTREE
LEAVING, AND SHUT IT DOWN.

28:24.448 --> 28:25.700
CHEF RAMSAY KNOWS

28:25.700 --> 28:28.244
HE HAS TO PUT AN END
TO THE MADNESS.

28:28.244 --> 28:30.329
NO MORE ENTREES.
I'M SORRY?

28:30.329 --> 28:32.123
TAKE THEIR FOOD AWAY.
WHY?

28:32.123 --> 28:33.374
'CAUSE WE'RE NOT
SERVING ANYMORE.

28:33.374 --> 28:36.293
WE ARE ABOUT AS DIRTY
AS A KITCHEN COULD BE,

28:36.293 --> 28:40.439
AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY
DISGUSTING.

28:40.439 --> 28:40.840
AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY
DISGUSTING.

28:40.840 --> 28:42.967
WE WILL NOT BE SERVING
ANY MORE FOOD THIS EVENING.

28:42.967 --> 28:44.176
AH.
OHH.

28:44.176 --> 28:47.763
I'M EXTREMELY SORRY.
THAT'S NO GOOD.

28:47.763 --> 28:49.390
I MEAN,
THIS IS SO  UP.

28:49.390 --> 28:50.766
IT'S SO RIDICULOUS.

28:50.766 --> 28:54.019
THE KITCHEN'S INFESTED.
THE OFFICE IS A MESS.

28:54.019 --> 28:55.646
AND ON YOUR CHAIRS
THAT YOU TOLD ME

28:55.646 --> 28:59.066
GOT CLEANED YEARS AGO,
A COMB, A CANDY CANE?

28:59.066 --> 29:01.485
I MEAN, OLD KLEENEX, USED.

29:01.485 --> 29:04.155
PEOPLE WIPING THEIR NOSE,
STICKING IT DOWN THE SIDE.

29:04.155 --> 29:05.781
YOU CAN'T EVEN GET CLARITY
IN THERE,

29:05.781 --> 29:07.992
BECAUSE YOU'RE SO FESTERING

29:07.992 --> 29:10.077
IN  CRAP EVERYWHERE.

29:10.077 --> 29:10.439
<i>BOTH OF YOU</i>
<i>SHOULD BE ASHAMED.</i>

29:10.439 --> 29:11.746
<i>BOTH OF YOU</i>
<i>SHOULD BE ASHAMED.</i>

29:11.746 --> 29:13.581
WHAT DID YOU SAY
TO ME TODAY?

29:13.581 --> 29:15.416
THAT I TAKE PRIDE
IN WHAT I DO.

29:15.416 --> 29:16.876
WHERE?

29:16.876 --> 29:20.463
I DON'T KNOW.
I AM NOT PROUD RIGHT NOW.

29:20.463 --> 29:23.007
WE GOT OVERWHELMED,
AND IT'S A.

29:23.007 --> 29:24.842
<i>IT'S A ,</i>
<i>AND IT'S A MESS.</i>

29:24.842 --> 29:26.969
AND MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST CLOSE IT DOWN

29:26.969 --> 29:31.015
AND LOSE EVERYTHING
WE HAVE.

29:31.015 --> 29:34.018
'CAUSE THAT'S PROBABLY
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

29:35.519 --> 29:38.814
HOW CAN I HELP
TWO INDIVIDUALS

29:38.814 --> 29:40.439
THAT DON'T EVEN CARE
ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING?

29:40.439 --> 29:40.941
THAT DON'T EVEN CARE
ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING?

29:40.941 --> 29:43.194
WE DO CARE.
WE CARE TREMENDOUSLY.

29:43.194 --> 29:45.946
SO WHY DIDN'T YOU DO ANYTHING
BEFORE I GOT HERE?

29:45.946 --> 29:49.116
WE DID. I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW MANY HOURS WE CLEANED.

29:49.116 --> 29:51.285
YOU CLEANED
BEFORE I GOT HERE?

29:51.285 --> 29:53.954
I THREW OUT MY CLOTHES
ON MONDAY,

29:53.954 --> 29:55.122
I WAS SO ENCASED
WITH GREASE.

29:55.122 --> 29:57.583
HOW LONG?
HOW MANY HOURS?

29:57.583 --> 30:00.753
HOW MANY DAYS?
FIVE.

30:03.297 --> 30:05.674
WHAT THE?

30:05.674 --> 30:08.427
YOU JUST NEED TO STOP.

30:12.515 --> 30:14.517
WHAT A  MESS.

30:14.517 --> 30:18.562
COME HERE. I LOVE YOU.

30:18.562 --> 30:20.022
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S GONNA GET BETTER.

30:20.022 --> 30:22.441
I NEVER THOUGHT MY RESTAURANT
WOULD BE SHUT DOWN.

30:22.441 --> 30:24.026
CAN I HAVE A QUICK WORD,
PLEASE...

30:24.026 --> 30:25.528
ABSOLUTELY.
WITH BOTH OF YOU, OUTSIDE.

30:25.528 --> 30:28.739
IT'S THE WORST MOMENT
OF MY LIFE, UNDOUBTEDLY.

30:28.739 --> 30:30.199
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN A LONG TIME,

30:30.199 --> 30:31.826
I'M NOT ACTUALLY TOO SURE
WHAT TO DO.

30:31.826 --> 30:33.911
<i>RIGHT NOW,</i>
<i>I WANNA GET OUT OF HERE.</i>

30:33.911 --> 30:36.038
PLEASE DON'T.
WE COULD REALLY USE YOUR HELP.

30:36.038 --> 30:40.439
THE MISTAKES ARE SO BASIC.

30:40.439 --> 30:40.459
THE MISTAKES ARE SO BASIC.

30:40.459 --> 30:43.337
WE PERHAPS SHOULD NOT
EVEN BE IN THE BUSINESS.

30:43.337 --> 30:45.589
THAT'S WHAT
I'M SCARED ABOUT.

30:45.589 --> 30:47.174
I THINK WE CAN DO THIS.

30:47.174 --> 30:49.009
WE DESPERATELY
NEED YOUR HELP.

30:49.009 --> 30:51.262
YOU TOLD ME IN THERE
THAT YOU CLEANED

30:51.262 --> 30:52.972
FOR FIVE DAYS
BEFORE I GOT HERE.

30:52.972 --> 30:55.015
DIDN'T DO ANY GOOD.

30:55.015 --> 30:57.142
<i>HOW DO I KNOW</i>
<i>THAT YOU REALLY GET IT</i>

30:57.142 --> 30:59.687
AND YOU REALLY WILL COMMIT

30:59.687 --> 31:01.272
TO GETTING THIS PLACE
TURNED AROUND?

31:01.272 --> 31:03.732
I CAN DO WHATEVER YOU SHOW ME.
I CAN DO IT.

31:03.732 --> 31:05.276
I'M BEGGING YOU TO STAY
AND HELP US, PLEASE.

31:05.276 --> 31:07.027
I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

31:07.027 --> 31:08.529
WE'RE NOT GONNA
LET YOU DOWN.

31:08.529 --> 31:10.439
NOW, IT'S YOUR CHANCE TO
PROVE IT TO YOURSELVES AND ME.

31:10.439 --> 31:12.992
NOW, IT'S YOUR CHANCE TO
PROVE IT TO YOURSELVES AND ME.

31:12.992 --> 31:15.327
SHOW ME.
OKAY, WE WILL.

31:15.327 --> 31:17.955
THANK YOU.
WE WILL.

31:28.841 --> 31:32.636
NICK,
THROW THIS  AWAY.

31:32.636 --> 31:36.181
IT WAS THE MOST MORTIFYING THING
I'VE EVER LIVED THROUGH.

31:36.181 --> 31:38.809
AND I HAVE NO EXCUSES.

31:41.228 --> 31:43.856
IT'S MY FAULT IF SOMETHING
ISN'T RIGHT HERE.

31:43.856 --> 31:45.816
IT'S A JOKE.
THIS IS MY RESTAURANT.

31:45.816 --> 31:47.401
I HAVE A LOT OF PRIDE IN IT.

31:47.401 --> 31:48.986
I WAS SHOWN
TOO MANY THINGS

31:48.986 --> 31:50.529
THAT I DID NOT WANT TO SEE.

31:50.529 --> 31:53.198
THE PROBLEM IS, I'M THE GUY
WHO'S SUPPOSED TO SEE IT.

31:55.242 --> 31:57.286
WE'RE NOT GOOD
AT WHAT WE DO.

31:57.286 --> 32:00.456
WE'RE NOT EVEN REMOTELY GOOD
AT WHAT WE DO.

32:00.456 --> 32:03.542
WE'LL GET BETTER,
A LOT BETTER.

32:03.542 --> 32:05.377
WE SPENT 24 YEARS HERE.

32:05.377 --> 32:06.962
I DON'T WANNA
CLOSE THIS PLACE DOWN,

32:06.962 --> 32:10.439
FILTHY AND DIRTY
AND NOT OPERATING AND A COFFIN.

32:10.439 --> 32:11.926
FILTHY AND DIRTY
AND NOT OPERATING AND A COFFIN.

32:11.926 --> 32:13.928
I DON'T WANT IT
TO BE A COFFIN.

32:13.928 --> 32:16.722
I WANT IT TO EXIST.

32:16.722 --> 32:19.642
I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU TOO.

32:32.696 --> 32:35.073
AFTER ONE OF THE WORST DAYS
THAT CHEF RAMSAY

32:35.073 --> 32:37.075
HAS EVER EXPERIENCED
ON <i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARES...</i>

32:37.075 --> 32:39.119
YEAH, WHAT A DIFFERENCE.

32:39.119 --> 32:40.787
HE IS PLEASED
WITH THE OVERNIGHT CLEANING

32:40.787 --> 32:42.247
DONE IN THE KITCHEN.

32:42.247 --> 32:44.833
NOW IT LOOKS AND SMELLS
LIKE A PROPER KITCHEN.

32:44.833 --> 32:46.293
GOOD.

32:46.293 --> 32:47.753
BUT HE HAS DECIDED
TO TAKE MATTERS

32:47.753 --> 32:50.756
LITERALLY INTO HIS OWN HANDS
IN THE DINING ROOM.

32:58.013 --> 32:59.264
OKAY, ALEXA,
HOW YOU FEELING?

32:59.264 --> 33:01.058
VERY NERVOUS.

33:01.058 --> 33:02.976
WHEN I FIRST
CAME TO RESTAURANT,

33:02.976 --> 33:05.437
I WAS OVERWHELMED
WITH THE CLUTTER.

33:05.437 --> 33:06.980
<i>RANDY, YOUR INABILITY</i>

33:28.210 --> 33:31.755
BECAUSE YOU ARE GONNA
GET RID OF THIS.

33:31.755 --> 33:34.382
MY HUSBAND HAS A HARD TIME
LETTING GO OF THINGS.

33:34.382 --> 33:36.635
AND IT'S EASIER
TO JUST STORE THEM

33:36.635 --> 33:38.220
AND THINK ABOUT GETTING RID
OF 'EM LATER,

33:38.220 --> 33:41.389
BUT THAT LATER TIME
NEVER CAME.

33:41.389 --> 33:43.475
YOU READY TO DO THIS?

33:43.475 --> 33:45.393
<i>I WANNA KEEP THE ACCORDION</i>

33:45.393 --> 33:47.521
<i>AND DR. WILEY'S</i>
<i>SCALP TREATMENT.</i>

33:47.521 --> 33:48.480
THAT'S GOT WILEY'S NAME ON IT.

33:48.480 --> 33:50.398
WHAT?

33:50.398 --> 33:52.234
RANDY, WHETHER YOU
LIKE IT OR NOT,

33:52.234 --> 33:55.862
RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE MOVING FORWARD.

33:55.862 --> 33:56.862
I BROUGHT IN THIS TRUCK.

33:56.862 --> 33:57.239
I BROUGHT IN THIS TRUCK.

33:57.239 --> 33:59.658
EITHER STORE OR DESTROY.

33:59.658 --> 34:03.453
<i>THE MAJORITY OF THIS STUFF</i>
<i>YOU KNOW DAMN WELL IS JUNK.</i>

34:05.330 --> 34:06.540
<i>LET'S GO.</i>
ALL RIGHT.

34:06.540 --> 34:08.750
<i>EXCELLENT, FOLLOW ALONG.</i>

34:08.750 --> 34:11.336
<i>PICK SOMETHING</i>
<i>FOR DESTRUCTION.</i>

34:11.336 --> 34:13.839
<i>EVERYBODY, JOIN IN.</i>

34:13.839 --> 34:16.633
<i>RANDY, NO?</i>

34:21.346 --> 34:23.765
I LOVE IT, LET'S GO.

34:25.642 --> 34:26.862
I'VE HAD THAT STUFF
FOR 30 YEARS.

34:26.862 --> 34:27.018
I'VE HAD THAT STUFF
FOR 30 YEARS.

34:27.018 --> 34:28.478
SOME STUFF IN THERE
LOOKED PRETTY GOOD.

34:28.478 --> 34:31.439
DIDN'T REALLY
WANNA PART WITH IT.

34:31.439 --> 34:33.733
<i>RANDY--</i>

34:33.733 --> 34:35.402
COME ROUND, RANDY.

34:35.402 --> 34:36.403
WHERE'S THE BUTTON?

34:36.403 --> 34:38.822
I WANT YOU TO DO IT.
WHICH ONE?

34:38.822 --> 34:40.198
I'M THROWING IT AWAY.

34:40.198 --> 34:41.741
I'M NOT GONNA
GET A DIME FOR IT.

34:43.869 --> 34:46.246
OH, THE TUBA!

34:46.246 --> 34:49.124
OH, THE TUBA.

34:52.878 --> 34:54.754
<i>YES, VICTORY.</i>

34:54.754 --> 34:56.862
<i>LOOK AT THAT.</i>

34:56.862 --> 34:57.299
<i>LOOK AT THAT.</i>

35:02.179 --> 35:04.431
IT'S PROBABLY THE GREATEST
FEELING IN THE ENTIRE WORLD,

35:04.431 --> 35:06.516
HAVING RANDY ACTUALLY
THROW THINGS AWAY.

35:06.516 --> 35:08.101
LET'S GO, GUYS.

35:08.101 --> 35:09.728
OH, NICK, THE MICROWAVE AGAIN.

35:09.728 --> 35:11.855
ONE, TWO, THREE.

35:11.855 --> 35:14.107
AND HONESTLY,
I THINK HE ENJOYED IT.

35:14.107 --> 35:16.276
I REALLY THINK HE DID.
SHOULD I SAVE THE LEGS,
CHEF?

35:16.276 --> 35:17.694
<i>YOU CANNOT SAVE THE LEGS.</i>

35:17.694 --> 35:20.197
I THINK HE TURNED A CORNER.

35:22.949 --> 35:25.327
RIGHT, THERE'S ONE MORE
VALUABLE PIECE.
OH, YES, THERE IS.

35:25.327 --> 35:26.862
FIONA TOO?
NO, CHEF.

35:26.862 --> 35:27.662
FIONA TOO?
NO, CHEF.

35:27.662 --> 35:29.122
<i>I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE CLOSE.</i>

35:29.122 --> 35:31.249
WE'RE NOT THAT CLOSE.
ARE YOU SURE NOW?

35:31.249 --> 35:34.044
I'M SURE.
I'M 150% SURE.

35:34.044 --> 35:36.463
IT'S TIME TO GO
WHERE YOU BELONG.

35:36.463 --> 35:38.673
<i>OH, EVERYBODY WAVE GOOD-BYE</i>
<i>TO FIONA.</i>

35:38.673 --> 35:39.758
<i>OH!</i>

35:39.758 --> 35:42.052
OH! SHE BROKE
INTO A MILLION PIECES.

35:42.052 --> 35:44.679
MAYBE YOU HAVE CHANGED.
I THINK SO.

35:44.679 --> 35:46.139
I DIDN'T THINK THERE
WAS GONNA BE ANY LIGHT

35:46.139 --> 35:47.390
AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL.

35:47.390 --> 35:49.518
BUT IN THE END,
I FEEL LIKE

35:49.518 --> 35:51.645
THE WORLD'S OFF MY SHOULDERS
WITH ALL THAT STUFF

35:51.645 --> 35:53.021
BEING CRUSHED
IN THE TRUCK.

35:53.021 --> 35:55.649
I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA
DIVE IN THE TRUCK AFTER.

35:57.192 --> 35:58.944
OKAY, I'VE BEEN WORKING
ON SOMETHING IN THE KITCHEN

35:58.944 --> 36:00.320
I WANNA SHOW YOU
RIGHT NOW.

36:00.320 --> 36:01.863
FOLLOW ME, PLEASE.

36:01.863 --> 36:03.949
LET'S GO.

36:05.700 --> 36:07.369
SO FIRST OF ALL,
YOU'LL NOTICE

36:07.369 --> 36:09.287
HOW DE-CLUTTERED
THE KITCHEN IS.

36:10.830 --> 36:13.208
<i>I'VE NEVER, EVER</i>
<i>OVERHAULED A KITCHEN</i>

36:13.208 --> 36:14.376
<i>TO THIS EXTENT--</i>

36:14.376 --> 36:18.129
<i>$65,000 WORTH OF EQUIPMENT.</i>

36:18.129 --> 36:21.383
<i>I DON'T KNOW</i>
<i>HOW YOU EVER LASTED A WEEK</i>

36:21.383 --> 36:22.842
<i>WORKING IN THIS KITCHEN</i>

36:22.842 --> 36:25.095
<i>WITH SUCH DREADFUL EQUIPMENT.</i>

36:25.095 --> 36:26.346
THERE'S KNOBS!
WOW.

36:27.514 --> 36:28.515
<i>THERE'S MORE THAN KNOBS.</i>

36:28.515 --> 36:31.309
I MADE A VERY URGENT CALL

36:31.309 --> 36:32.644
TO OUR FRIENDS AT CULIQUIP.

36:32.644 --> 36:34.145
<i>AND THEY CAME THROUGH</i>
<i>LAST MINUTE</i>

36:34.145 --> 36:37.357
<i>WITH BRAND-NEW</i>
<i>KITCHEN EQUIPMENT.</i>

36:37.357 --> 36:39.109
TAKE A LOOK
AT THIS STUNNING RANGE.

36:39.109 --> 36:44.823
A STUNNING RAPID SIX-RING
GAS BURNER FROM THERMA-TEK.

36:44.823 --> 36:45.949
<i>IT'S AMAZING.</i>

36:45.949 --> 36:47.742
<i>TWO FULL-SIZE OVENS.</i>

36:47.742 --> 36:50.412
OH, I JUST WANNA
COOK SOMETHING.

36:50.412 --> 36:51.496
YEAH.
NOW, STRAIGHT ON
THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE,

36:51.496 --> 36:54.040
IS THE BROASTER
PRESSURE FRYER.

36:54.040 --> 36:55.125
<i>IT'S NOT JUST A FRYER.</i>

36:55.125 --> 36:56.209
<i>BROASTED CHICKEN</i>
<i>COMES OUT GREAT.</i>

36:56.209 --> 36:56.862
AND IT IS A UNIQUE AND FAST,
HEALTHY WAY OF COOKING.

36:56.862 --> 36:59.588
AND IT IS A UNIQUE AND FAST,
HEALTHY WAY OF COOKING.

36:59.588 --> 37:02.507
THE WHOLE SYSTEM
SEALS IN THE TENDERNESS,

37:02.507 --> 37:04.426
<i>AND THE FLAVOR IS RETAINED.</i>

37:04.426 --> 37:06.219
WOW.
THAT IS TOO GOOD.

37:06.219 --> 37:07.971
WE ALSO REPLACED
THAT DREADFUL OLD FRYER

37:07.971 --> 37:11.266
WITH A BRAND-NEW
IMPERIAL DUAL BASKET FRYER.

37:11.266 --> 37:14.561
LOOK, YOU CAN SEE
THROUGH THE GREASE, IT'S CLEAN.

37:14.561 --> 37:16.146
YOU HAVE A BRAND-NEW
PREP AREA NOW.

37:16.146 --> 37:18.064
THAT'S CHILLED.
EVERYTHING'S WORKING.

37:18.064 --> 37:19.190
<i>IT'S ALL IN ONE PIECE.</i>

37:19.190 --> 37:20.859
IT'S ALL IN ONE PIECE.

37:20.859 --> 37:22.277
<i>PUT YOUR HANDS IN THERE,</i>
<i>FEEL THAT.</i>

37:22.277 --> 37:25.572
THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL
A REFRIGERATION UNIT.

37:25.572 --> 37:26.862
IT'S THE MOST AMAZING EQUIPMENT
I'VE EVER SEEN.

37:26.862 --> 37:27.073
IT'S THE MOST AMAZING EQUIPMENT
I'VE EVER SEEN.

37:27.073 --> 37:30.660
IT'S ALL SO NEW
AND COMPACT AND CLEAN.

37:30.660 --> 37:33.246
THE RIVER NEIGHBORHOOD
IS GONE.

37:33.246 --> 37:35.415
IT'S ABSOLUTELY
THE MOST INCREDIBLE DAY

37:35.415 --> 37:37.208
OF MY LIFE RIGHT NOW.

37:37.208 --> 37:38.418
<i>SHE'S GONNA CRY AGAIN.</i>

37:38.418 --> 37:39.919
NO, I'M TRYING NOT TO.

37:39.919 --> 37:41.296
IT'S OKAY,
THOSE ARE GOOD TEARS.

37:41.296 --> 37:42.839
<i>YOU CAN LET THOSE OUT.</i>

37:42.839 --> 37:44.299
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
IT'S INSPIRED ME.

37:44.299 --> 37:45.592
I CAN'T WAIT.
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU--

37:45.592 --> 37:47.385
YOU HAVEN'T HAD ANYTHING NEW
IN THIS KITCHEN

37:47.385 --> 37:48.928
FOR HOW LONG?
33 YEARS.

37:48.928 --> 37:50.013
33 YEARS.

37:50.013 --> 37:52.515
THAT'S WAY TOO LONG,
LET ME TELL YOU.

37:52.515 --> 37:56.186
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
THAT IS WAY TOO LONG.

38:02.107 --> 38:04.568
WITH A CLEAR INDICATION
THAT RANDY AND ALEXA

38:04.568 --> 38:06.236
HAVE SEEN THE ERROR
OF THEIR WAYS,

38:06.236 --> 38:08.572
CHEF RAMSAY CONTINUES
TO PUSH FORWARD

38:08.572 --> 38:12.075
WITH HIS MASSIVE TRANSFORMATION,
INCLUDING A NEW SIGN.

38:12.075 --> 38:13.327
GOOD MORNING.

38:13.327 --> 38:14.953
GOOD MORNING, CHEF.

38:14.953 --> 38:16.079
PLEASE TAKE OFF
YOUR BLINDFOLDS.

38:17.080 --> 38:19.124
COOL!
WOW.

38:19.124 --> 38:21.043
<i>AWESOME.</i>
<i>GREAT!</i>
<i>SO COOL.</i>

38:21.043 --> 38:22.669
<i>SOMETHING THAT</i>
<i>WAS COMPLETELY DATED</i>

38:22.669 --> 38:24.463
<i>WAS THAT HIDEOUS SIGN.</i>

38:24.463 --> 38:27.549
NOW, ARE YOU READY
FOR MORE CHANGE?

38:27.549 --> 38:28.550
YES.

38:28.550 --> 38:29.110
COME ON IN
TO YOUR NEW RESTAURANT.

38:29.110 --> 38:31.637
COME ON IN
TO YOUR NEW RESTAURANT.

38:33.305 --> 38:36.558
OH, MY GOSH,
IT SMELLS SO GOOD.
OH, MY GOD.

38:36.558 --> 38:38.685
<i>HOW BEAUTIFUL IS THIS?</i>

38:38.685 --> 38:39.853
<i>OH, COOL.</i>
<i>OH, MY GOD.</i>

38:39.853 --> 38:41.521
<i>LET'S JUST START OFF</i>
<i>WITH THE BOOTHS FIRST--</i>

38:41.521 --> 38:44.691
REUPHOLSTERED
WITH A STAIN-RESISTANT,

38:44.691 --> 38:46.818
<i>STUNNING MATERIAL.</i>

38:46.818 --> 38:49.321
DOES ANYBODY NOTICE
THE WHEELS HAVE GONE,

38:49.321 --> 38:50.989
AND THE NEW CHAIRS ARE HERE?

38:50.989 --> 38:54.618
I'M REALLY GLAD THEY GOT RID
OF ALL THE NASTY CHAIRS.

38:54.618 --> 38:56.828
I THINK IT'S GONNA BE
A GREAT FRESH START FOR US

38:56.828 --> 38:58.622
AND ONE WE REALLY NEEDED.

38:58.622 --> 38:59.110
<i>PLEASE, COME ON DOWN.</i>

38:59.110 --> 39:00.457
<i>PLEASE, COME ON DOWN.</i>

39:00.457 --> 39:03.877
GONE IS
THAT ANTIQUATED P. O. S. SYSTEM.

39:03.877 --> 39:05.295
AND WE HAVE REPLACED IT

39:05.295 --> 39:10.759
WITH A STATE-OF-THE-ART,
BRAND-NEW, UNIQUE P. O. S.,

39:10.759 --> 39:12.719
<i>GIVEN TO US BY DINERWARE.</i>

39:12.719 --> 39:14.763
<i>IT'S FABULOUS.</i>
<i>IT'S INCREDIBLE.</i>

39:14.763 --> 39:17.015
YES, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

39:17.015 --> 39:18.684
OLD NEIGHBORHOOD'S MENU
WAS CLUTTERED,

39:18.684 --> 39:20.644
MUCH LIKE THE RESTAURANT...

39:20.644 --> 39:22.062
TAKE A MENU, PLEASE.

39:22.062 --> 39:23.814
SO CHEF RAMSAY
NOT ONLY REVAMPED THE FOOD,

39:23.814 --> 39:26.483
BUT ALSO CUT DOWN
THE MENU SIZE DRAMATICALLY,

39:26.483 --> 39:29.110
FROM 95 ITEMS
TO 20 STUNNING DISHES.

39:29.110 --> 39:29.361
FROM 95 ITEMS
TO 20 STUNNING DISHES.

39:29.361 --> 39:30.862
<i>RIGHT, VISUALLY,</i>
<i>KEEPING WITH THE DECOR--</i>

39:30.862 --> 39:34.533
MODERN, CLASSIC,
FRESH, AND FUN.

39:34.533 --> 39:36.493
I WANT YOU TO JUMP IN
AND START EATING.

39:36.493 --> 39:37.703
OOH, I'M DIGGING IN.

39:37.703 --> 39:38.787
SO MUCH BETTER
THAN WHAT WE HAD.

39:38.787 --> 39:40.080
<i>SO DELICIOUS.</i>

39:40.080 --> 39:42.708
THE MENU JUST WENT
FROM FOUR PAGES DOWN TO ONE,

39:42.708 --> 39:44.543
AND THE NEW FOOD
IS AMAZING.

39:44.543 --> 39:46.461
IT'S NOT GOING BACK
TO FOUR PAGES.

39:46.461 --> 39:47.671
THAT IS SO GOOD.

39:47.671 --> 39:49.464
NOW THAT
THIS LANDMARK RESTAURANT

39:49.464 --> 39:52.092
HAS GONE THROUGH MASSIVE CHANGES
IN ALL AREAS...

39:52.092 --> 39:53.677
WELCOME TO
THE NEW OLD NEIGHBORHOOD.

39:53.677 --> 39:56.221
THE DOORS OPEN
FOR THE GRAND REOPENING.

39:56.221 --> 39:57.431
HOW ARE WE DOING
THIS EVENING?

39:57.431 --> 39:59.110
AND WITH A NEW SYSTEM
IN PLACE...

39:59.110 --> 39:59.141
AND WITH A NEW SYSTEM

39:59.141 --> 40:00.600
OKAY, WE ARE READY.

OUT TO THE DINERS.

40:04.563 --> 40:06.648
OKAY, ONE CHEESE DIP,
GET IT STARTED.

40:06.648 --> 40:09.359
THREE POUTINES,
ONE RIGHT AWAY,

40:09.359 --> 40:10.569
BY ITSELF, SINGLED OUT.

40:10.569 --> 40:13.780
GUYS, WHY AM I COMING DOWN HERE
MAKING MAC AND CHEESE?

40:13.780 --> 40:15.115
<i>I CAN'T DO EVERYTHING.</i>

40:15.115 --> 40:17.492
ONLY 30 MINUTES INTO SERVICE,

40:17.492 --> 40:18.869
CHEF RAMSAY REALIZES
THAT ALTHOUGH

40:18.869 --> 40:21.538
ALEXA COMPLAINS ABOUT
THE STAFF DOING LITTLE...

40:21.538 --> 40:22.831
WATCH OUT.
GIVE IT TO HIM.

40:22.831 --> 40:24.374
MATT CAN PLATE THIS UP.

40:24.374 --> 40:25.584

ALMOST NO DELEGATING.

I WANNA SHOW YOU SOMETHING
VERY IMPORTANT.

40:29.379 --> 40:30.672
YOU'RE COOKING

OKAY, YOU'RE IN CHARGE.

40:34.051 --> 40:35.552
ALL RIGHT, I GOT IT.
YOU'RE NOT THE LINE COOK.

40:35.552 --> 40:36.344
ABSOLUTELY.
YOU'RE THE CHEF.

40:36.344 --> 40:37.429
NO, RIGHT.
COME ON, YOU CAN DO IT.

40:37.429 --> 40:38.847
ABSOLUTELY.

40:44.394 --> 40:46.563
HERE WE GO, MASHED POTATOES,
NEED THE GREEN BEANS.

40:46.563 --> 40:49.066
LET'S PUT

40:49.066 --> 40:50.984

AND CHEESE OVER HERE, PLEASE.

40:54.404 --> 40:56.114

KEEP IT GOING, LEXI.

40:56.114 --> 40:57.657
WITH CHEF RAMSAY'S ADVICE
STILL RINGING IN HER EARS...

40:57.657 --> 40:59.110
<i>OFF YOU GO.</i>

40:59.110 --> 40:59.159
<i>OFF YOU GO.</i>

41:03.163 --> 41:04.706
EVEN IMPRESSING CHEF RAMSAY.

41:04.706 --> 41:06.291
WELL DONE.
KEEP IT GOING, YES?

41:06.291 --> 41:08.418

41:08.418 --> 41:09.669
POUTINE.

41:09.669 --> 41:10.670

41:10.670 --> 41:11.922
WHOA.

41:11.922 --> 41:13.298
OH, MY GOD.
THAT IS SO GOOD.

41:13.298 --> 41:14.841
IT'S PERFECT.

41:14.841 --> 41:16.510
IT REALLY IS.
IT'S A LOT OF FLAVOR.

41:16.510 --> 41:18.178
THAT TARTAR SAUCE
IS PHENOMENAL.

41:18.178 --> 41:19.513
IT'S LIKE
A COMPLETELY NEW RESTAURANT.

41:19.513 --> 41:20.514
IT'S INCREDIBLE.

41:23.225 --> 41:24.935
WELL DONE, THAT'S WHAT
I WANNA SAY TO YOU ALL.

41:24.935 --> 41:27.354
THIS RESTAURANT IS BACK.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

41:27.354 --> 41:29.110
<i>IT HAS A GREAT MENU.</i>

41:29.110 --> 41:29.189
<i>IT HAS A GREAT MENU.</i>

41:29.189 --> 41:32.567
AND OVERALL, YOU SHOULD
BE PROUD OF YOURSELF.

41:32.567 --> 41:34.319
DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THAT.

41:34.319 --> 41:37.656
AND, ALEXA, FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN A LONG TIME,

41:37.656 --> 41:39.241
YOU WERE NOT ONLY THE VOICE,

41:39.241 --> 41:41.284
BUT YOU HELD THE REINS
IN THAT KITCHEN.

41:41.284 --> 41:42.661
I KEPT IT TOGETHER,

41:42.661 --> 41:44.079
AND I COULDN'T
HAVE GOTTEN HERE

41:44.079 --> 41:45.789
WITHOUT THE HELP
THAT I'VE GOTTEN.

41:45.789 --> 41:47.290
THANKS VERY MUCH.
OKAY.

41:47.290 --> 41:49.042
APPRECIATE IT, OKAY.
OKAY.

41:49.042 --> 41:50.460
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.
GET THE BOYS

41:50.460 --> 41:51.628
CLEANING THAT KITCHEN, OKAY?

41:51.628 --> 41:53.380
THEY'LL BURN LESS.
THANKS, CHEF.

41:53.380 --> 41:54.506
GOOD NIGHT, DARLING,
GOOD JOB.

41:54.506 --> 41:55.799
THANK YOU.
<i>WELL DONE.</i>

41:57.509 --> 41:59.110
IN THE LAST 25 YEARS,
THIS RESTAURANT

41:59.110 --> 42:00.095
IN THE LAST 25 YEARS,
THIS RESTAURANT

42:00.095 --> 42:03.098
WENT FROM BEING A TOWN LANDMARK
TO A FILTHY DISASTER.

42:03.098 --> 42:04.349
AND I WAS SERIOUSLY WORRIED

42:04.349 --> 42:06.309
THAT THESE TWO OWNERS
WOULD NEVER CHANGE.

42:06.309 --> 42:09.271
RANDY STARTED TO IMPRESS ME
WHEN HE LET GO OF THE PAST.

42:09.271 --> 42:12.149
BUT TONIGHT,
ALEXA REALLY STEPPED UP

42:12.149 --> 42:13.775
AND SHOWED
NOT ONLY CAN SHE COOK,

42:13.775 --> 42:15.694
BUT SHE CAN RUN A KITCHEN.

42:15.694 --> 42:18.405
AND I DON'T THINK
WE'VE EVER

42:18.405 --> 42:20.907
MADE A RESTAURANT TRANSFORMATION
AS BIG AS THIS ONE.

42:20.907 --> 42:23.201
NOW, THIS MAY BE CALLED
THE OLD NEIGHBORHOOD,

42:23.201 --> 42:25.287
BUT TRUST ME,
IT'S A NEW RESTAURANT,

42:25.287 --> 42:28.248
BACK ON THE ROAD
TO SUCCESS.

42:28.248 --> 42:29.110
WHO HAS A MANNEQUIN AS A FRIEND?

42:29.110 --> 42:31.459
WHO HAS A MANNEQUIN AS A FRIEND?

42:31.459 --> 42:34.963
REST IN PEACE, FIONA.
WOW.

42:39.217 --> 42:40.594
THE NEW OLD NEIGHBORHOOD.
MAY I HELP YOU?

42:40.594 --> 42:42.053
AFTER CHEF RAMSAY LEFT,

42:42.053 --> 42:44.181
BUSINESS
AT THE OLD NEIGHBORHOOD

42:44.181 --> 42:45.348
IMMEDIATELY WENT
ON THE RISE.

42:45.348 --> 42:47.851
I WANNA SEE FISH AND CHIPS,
FIRST PLATE.

42:47.851 --> 42:50.187
ALEXA HAS EMBRACED THE NEW MENU

42:50.187 --> 42:51.354
AND HAS DONE A GREAT JOB

42:51.354 --> 42:53.231
MANAGING THE KITCHEN
AS WELL.

42:53.231 --> 42:54.608
ONE RACK WORTH GOES DOWN,

42:54.608 --> 42:56.318
WE NEED ANOTHER
WHOLE RACK WORTH IN THERE.

42:56.318 --> 42:57.569
AND WE'RE HAPPY TO REPORT

42:57.569 --> 42:59.110
SHE'S ALSO DONE A GREAT JOB
MANAGING RANDY,

42:59.110 --> 43:00.155
SHE'S ALSO DONE A GREAT JOB
MANAGING RANDY,

43:00.155 --> 43:01.364
WHO NO LONGER

43:01.364 --> 43:04.201
BRINGS ANY OF HIS JUNK
INTO THE RESTAURANT.
