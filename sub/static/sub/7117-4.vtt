00:06.150 --> 00:11.930
Let's... discuss... acting...

00:17.670 --> 00:18.910
What about acting?

00:19.520 --> 00:22.050
Oh, yes. Any questions?

00:26.020 --> 00:30.680
One time, my brother painted
part of his body purple.

00:30.720 --> 00:32.810
Well, why did your brother
paint part of his body purple?

00:32.850 --> 00:36.050
He had a job interview.

00:36.090 --> 00:39.060
He didn't get it.

00:40.490 --> 00:42.860
Wait, wait, wait.

00:42.890 --> 00:46.400
Would anyone be interested
in seeing the cast list.

00:46.430 --> 00:50.200
For our little play called steamboat Suzy?

00:50.230 --> 00:50.970
Yeah.

00:51.000 --> 00:51.400
Yeah.

00:51.440 --> 00:52.640
You know it.

00:52.670 --> 00:54.810
I got the lead, right?

00:54.840 --> 00:56.140
Pardon?

00:56.180 --> 01:09.930
I'm playing Suzy, right?

01:09.930 --> 01:17.130
Did you get the lead?

01:17.170 --> 01:19.940
I don't think she got it.

01:19.970 --> 01:27.080
So who's playing Suzy?

01:27.120 --> 01:28.420
Me.

01:28.450 --> 01:30.720
Yeah, her. That.

01:30.750 --> 01:31.980
She got the lead.

01:32.020 --> 01:33.720
Well, what part did you get?

01:33.760 --> 01:36.790
I got cheated and humiliated.

01:36.830 --> 01:40.030
You get used to it.

01:40.060 --> 01:42.530
All right, now chill down.

01:42.560 --> 01:43.260
Let's see.

01:43.300 --> 01:46.370
It says right here, "jade West, understudy.

01:46.400 --> 01:47.570
For the role of Suzy."

01:47.600 --> 01:48.230
Oh, yee-hoo.

01:48.270 --> 01:51.740
Like it's my dream to be Tori's understudy.

01:51.770 --> 01:53.140
What's an understudy?

01:53.170 --> 01:57.570
Oh, man.

01:57.610 --> 02:00.450
Um, an understudy is
like a back-up actor.

02:00.480 --> 02:02.780
So if you get sick or something,
your understudy takes over.

02:02.820 --> 02:04.380
For your part in the play.

02:04.420 --> 02:07.950
Yeah, yeah, if you get sick or go missing.

02:07.990 --> 02:14.560
Or get hit by a bus. Uhhh.

02:14.600 --> 02:23.470

I swear, I don't know why granny
Smith apples get a bad rap.

03:32.740 --> 03:44.450
This is one of the best
apples I've ever eaten.

03:44.490 --> 03:47.650
Looks like granny Smith broke her hip.

03:47.690 --> 03:48.750
Why did you smush his apple?

03:48.790 --> 03:49.890
'Cause I felt like it.

03:49.920 --> 03:52.490
Ah, she's still all mad
'cause Tori got the lead.

03:52.530 --> 03:55.090
In steamboat Suzy.

03:55.130 --> 03:56.660
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

03:56.700 --> 04:00.870
You wanna talk about it, baby?

04:00.870 --> 04:04.170
Hey boys and squirrels.

04:04.210 --> 04:08.340
Squirrels does sound like girls.

04:08.380 --> 04:10.640
Hey, after school, you guys wanna
go get some Sushi at nozu?

04:10.680 --> 04:11.180
Sure.

04:11.210 --> 04:11.640
Sounds good.

04:11.680 --> 04:13.450
Not with you.

04:13.480 --> 04:15.150
You know, actually my tummy has
been feeling kind of weird.

04:15.180 --> 04:17.180
These past couple of days.

04:17.220 --> 04:21.790
Ah, it's always something.

04:23.490 --> 04:26.790
Who's this? Hello?

04:26.830 --> 04:28.500
Yeah, this is Tori.

04:28.530 --> 04:31.330
You... wait, how did you get my number?

04:31.370 --> 04:32.070
Who is it?

04:32.100 --> 04:33.730
Some guy who works for lady gaga.

04:33.770 --> 04:34.300
Ah.

04:34.340 --> 04:35.070
Whoa.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.070
Sshh.

04:36.110 --> 04:38.870
Sshh.

04:38.910 --> 04:43.040
Hi, sorry. She is? Really?

04:43.080 --> 04:43.880
What's he saying?

04:43.910 --> 04:45.780
They're doing a new music
video next Friday,

04:45.820 --> 04:50.150
and they're looking for
dancers and back-up singers.

04:50.190 --> 04:53.020
Wait, but aren't you doing
steamboat Suzy next Friday?

04:53.060 --> 04:54.690
Yeah.

04:54.720 --> 04:58.360
Look, I'm starring in a play
that night so I... oh my God.

04:58.390 --> 05:00.390
You're gonna turn down a
job in a real music video.

05:00.430 --> 05:04.430
Just to be in some little
play here at school?

05:04.470 --> 05:07.270
Well, I guess I could blow off the play.

05:07.300 --> 05:07.870
Oh, yeah.

05:07.900 --> 05:10.340
And then Jade will get to play your part.

05:10.370 --> 05:15.970
Yeah, I... yeah.

05:16.010 --> 05:21.180
She would, wouldn't she?

05:21.210 --> 05:23.910
Hello, sir. Yeah.

05:23.950 --> 05:26.620
I was wondering...

05:27.920 --> 05:29.720
Ahh!

05:29.760 --> 05:34.030
Ah.

05:34.060 --> 05:35.030
Sinjin.

05:35.060 --> 05:35.930
Jade made me do it.

05:35.960 --> 05:39.160
She promised me $30 and
a complete makeover.

05:39.200 --> 05:39.930
Well, you failed.

05:39.970 --> 05:44.800
So now you don't get $30, and you
get to keep looking like that.

05:44.840 --> 05:46.710
You made sinjin try to trick
me into missing the play.

05:46.740 --> 05:48.110
So you could steal my part?

05:48.140 --> 05:48.710
Okay.

05:48.740 --> 05:50.980
I am not gonna just stand here
and listen to you accuse me.

05:51.010 --> 05:56.280
Of things I clearly did.

05:56.320 --> 05:57.980
You have anything to say to me?

05:58.020 --> 05:59.080
Teach me to dance.

05:59.120 --> 06:00.070
No.

06:02.860 --> 06:06.600
Jade tried to steal my part in Steamboat Suzy.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.410
P.S: I will not teach Sinjin to dance.

06:09.410 --> 06:12.160
Feeling: Cranky.

06:12.630 --> 06:13.960
Captain.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.300
Captain, the storm is getting worse.

06:16.340 --> 06:17.440
You think I can't see that?

06:17.470 --> 06:19.570
Now get down below before
anything else happens.

06:19.610 --> 06:26.210
Oh, okay, oh... Captain,
you've been hit by lightning.

06:26.250 --> 06:27.380
I can't get up.

06:27.410 --> 06:29.150
You better dock the boat.

06:29.180 --> 06:30.880
We're not docking.

06:30.920 --> 06:32.650
I'll Captain this boat.

06:32.690 --> 06:36.260
You? Don't be ridiculous.

06:43.060 --> 06:45.260
That little girl is sick.

06:45.300 --> 06:48.730
Help me. Please, help.

06:48.770 --> 06:51.400
We've got to get her to
new Orleans by daybreak.

06:51.440 --> 06:53.100
You can't Captain a boat.

06:53.140 --> 06:54.810
You're just a woman.

06:54.840 --> 06:57.780
I may be a woman but that doesn't
mean I'm not the best dang.

07:30.410 --> 07:33.440
I got flowers for Tori Vega?

07:33.480 --> 07:36.680
Me? Huh.

07:36.710 --> 07:38.650
I wonder who would've sent
me flowers... oh, Tori,

07:38.680 --> 07:39.250
those are bush daisies.

07:39.280 --> 07:40.780
Ahh!

07:40.820 --> 07:41.680
What's up?

07:41.720 --> 07:43.290
I'm way allergic to bush daisies.

07:43.320 --> 07:45.220
Like if I get anywhere
near them, my whole face.

07:45.260 --> 07:47.720
Starts swelling up, and I
start sweating and shaking...

07:47.760 --> 07:49.960
Well, who would've sent you bush daisies?

07:49.990 --> 07:52.760
I don't know.

07:52.800 --> 07:56.300
Or maybe I do.

07:56.330 --> 07:58.500
How did you know I was
allergic to bush daisies?

07:58.540 --> 08:00.740
I do my research.

08:00.770 --> 08:02.400
You looked up my medical records?

08:02.440 --> 08:03.910
I'll answer that right
after you stick your face.

08:03.940 --> 08:06.570
In those bush daisies.

08:06.610 --> 08:08.040
Listen to me.

08:08.080 --> 08:09.740
I'm doing this play.

08:09.780 --> 08:15.880
I auditioned, I got the
lead, and I'm doing it.

08:15.920 --> 08:17.480
I don't care what you do.

08:17.520 --> 08:19.190
All right.

08:19.220 --> 08:21.460
Pick it back up where we left off.

08:21.490 --> 08:22.220
Trina.

08:22.260 --> 08:22.920
Yep?

08:22.960 --> 08:24.730
I wasn't believing your cough.

08:24.760 --> 08:27.660
You need to really sell the tuberculosis.

08:27.700 --> 08:31.000
Uh, like this?

08:36.909 --> 08:39.210
Yeah, that's not good.

08:39.240 --> 08:40.309
Hey, hey.

08:40.340 --> 08:41.340
Robbie's in the hospital.

08:41.380 --> 08:42.809
What?

08:42.850 --> 08:43.510
What's wrong with him?

08:43.549 --> 08:44.080
I don't know.

08:44.110 --> 08:46.150
His stomach was hurting really
bad, so an ambulance took him.

08:46.180 --> 08:48.250
To the emergency room,
and they x-rayed him.

08:48.280 --> 08:49.350
And what'd they find?

08:49.390 --> 08:53.920
Well, according to this
text message from Rex,

08:53.960 --> 08:57.590
it says, "there's a car
parked in Robbie's butt."

08:57.630 --> 08:59.160
Oh my God.

08:59.190 --> 09:00.730
I don't know what that means.

09:00.760 --> 09:03.030
Well, who would?

09:03.070 --> 09:04.360
Is Robbie gonna be okay?

09:04.400 --> 09:04.930
I don't know.

09:04.970 --> 09:07.330
His parents are in Boca, so I'm
gonna head over to the hospital.

09:07.370 --> 09:08.470
Well, can we come?

09:08.500 --> 09:09.900
We wanna see Robbie.

09:09.940 --> 09:11.340
Sikowitz?

09:11.370 --> 09:15.040
Yes, of course, but the
play starts at 7:30.

09:15.080 --> 09:16.440
We'll be back way before then.

09:16.480 --> 09:17.280
Come on.

09:17.310 --> 09:17.910
Okay.

09:17.950 --> 09:19.280
Bye.

09:19.320 --> 09:21.850
Whoa, wait, Jade.

09:21.890 --> 09:23.080
What?

09:23.120 --> 09:25.190
Is this just another trick
to get me out of the play.

09:25.220 --> 09:26.550
So you can steal my part?

09:26.590 --> 09:27.350
No.

09:27.390 --> 09:28.260
And what if you're lying?

09:28.290 --> 09:30.020
Fine.

09:30.060 --> 09:33.190
I'll go to the hospital, you stay here.

09:33.230 --> 09:35.400
Okay. Wait.

09:35.430 --> 09:37.800
What?

09:37.830 --> 09:40.400
How do I know that you're not
tricking me by having me stay here.

09:40.440 --> 09:42.970
While you go to the hospital...
Both of you go to the hospital.

09:43.010 --> 09:43.400
All right.

09:43.440 --> 09:49.110
We'll both go.

09:49.140 --> 09:51.440
Ohhh.

09:51.480 --> 09:55.220
So, how you feeling?

09:55.250 --> 09:55.820
Not good.

09:55.850 --> 10:00.320
I have a sharp pain in my lower
abdomen... Rob, Rob, Rob, listen.

10:00.360 --> 10:01.560
What?

10:01.590 --> 10:06.830
I don't care.

10:06.860 --> 10:08.400
Oh.

10:08.430 --> 10:09.870
Hey, guys.

10:09.900 --> 10:12.900
There's a car parked in Robbie's butt.

10:12.940 --> 10:14.170
Quit saying that.

10:14.210 --> 10:15.940
Robbie, you wanna explain?

10:15.970 --> 10:18.670
Well, when I was seven years
old, I took my favorite.

10:18.710 --> 10:23.980
Little toy car to school, and a
scary bully made me swallow it.

10:24.010 --> 10:27.950
Yeah, she was real scary.

10:27.980 --> 10:30.750
Remember how she kept whupping
you with her ponytail?

10:30.790 --> 10:33.150
They were braids.

10:33.190 --> 10:37.690
So, wait, this little toy car,
it's been inside of you.

10:37.730 --> 10:39.830
For almost 10 years?

10:39.860 --> 10:40.730
Uh-huh.

10:40.770 --> 10:47.300
So this little car, why won't
it just, you know, back out?

10:47.340 --> 10:51.040
Well, the doctor says it's
stuck in my small intestine.

10:51.080 --> 10:53.640
That's my X-ray right over there.

10:53.680 --> 10:54.250
Oh.

10:54.280 --> 10:56.080
Oh, yeah, that's a car.

10:56.120 --> 10:59.750
Yep, that's... what kind of car is it?

10:59.790 --> 11:01.090
Looks like a sports car.

11:01.120 --> 11:02.690
Yeah, it's a Pontiac.

11:02.720 --> 11:04.560
Oh.

11:04.590 --> 11:05.190
That's humiliating.

11:05.230 --> 11:06.260
Excuse me.

11:06.290 --> 11:08.630
Robbie's parents are on
the phone in reception.

11:08.660 --> 11:09.330
Oh, good.

11:09.360 --> 11:10.560
Robbie, I'll see you in a few.

11:10.600 --> 11:11.600
Thanks, lane.

11:11.630 --> 11:13.300
Hey, do you have any lotion?

11:13.330 --> 11:15.870
Lotion?

11:15.900 --> 11:18.370
So, is there anything we can do to help?

11:18.400 --> 11:19.400
Shhh.

11:20.570 --> 11:21.310
Listen.

11:23.850 --> 11:27.080
That is some juicy coughing and hacking.

11:28.820 --> 11:29.450
So?

11:29.480 --> 11:32.220
I'm playing the role of a
little girl with tuberculosis,

11:32.250 --> 11:35.590
and I want my coughing and hacking
to sound realistic like his.

11:37.090 --> 11:38.720
Wait till I get there.

11:38.760 --> 11:39.760
Come with me.

11:39.790 --> 11:42.400
Kay-kay.

11:42.430 --> 11:43.500
Oh my goodness, Robbie.

11:43.530 --> 11:46.770
I didn't realize you were so popular.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.040
Are you his girlfriend?

11:48.070 --> 11:51.270
No. Are you?

11:51.310 --> 11:53.070
Okay. Why don't you go
down the nursery and scare.

11:53.110 --> 11:55.180
The newborn babies?

11:55.210 --> 11:58.310
Oh. Where are the babies?

11:58.350 --> 12:02.320
Uh... so, doc, what's the
situation with Robbie?

12:02.350 --> 12:05.520
Well, do you see this tear
in his small intestine?

12:05.560 --> 12:06.020
Yeah.

12:06.060 --> 12:06.620
Okay.

12:06.660 --> 12:12.830
Well, if that Pontiac moves, it
could rip that kid's guts apart.

12:12.860 --> 12:14.860
So slice him open and yank it out.

12:14.900 --> 12:18.400
Well, we would, but Robbie has
a rare blood type, o-negative.

12:18.440 --> 12:19.230
Oh.

12:19.270 --> 12:21.500
Negative.

12:21.540 --> 12:23.670
And we don't have enough
here for the surgery.

12:23.710 --> 12:26.980
So how do you plan to... whoa.
Whoa.

12:27.010 --> 12:29.710
I know where he can get
some o-negative blood.

12:29.750 --> 12:30.780
Where?

12:30.810 --> 12:34.580
Right here.

12:34.620 --> 12:36.080
I'm o-negative?

12:36.120 --> 12:38.090
You did go through my medical records.

12:38.120 --> 12:41.720
Told you I do my research.

12:41.760 --> 12:46.030
Would you be willing to donate
blood for Robbie's operation?

12:46.060 --> 12:47.690
Sure. Totally.

12:47.730 --> 12:49.700
But the play starts in three hours.

12:49.730 --> 12:51.300
Oh, you're in a play?

12:51.330 --> 12:53.100
Yeah, at school.

12:53.130 --> 12:53.830
I'm the lead.

12:53.870 --> 12:55.700
Well, don't you have an understudy,
someone that could take.

12:55.740 --> 12:58.170
Your place?

12:58.210 --> 13:00.320
Yeah, she does.

13:08.000 --> 13:14.410
A lady is about to take my blood. I hope she's nice to it.

13:14.410 --> 13:17.630
Feeling: Nervous.

13:18.950 --> 13:19.950
Is this gonna hurt?

13:19.980 --> 13:22.520
Probably.

13:22.550 --> 13:26.490
Marlon, put your teacher
on the phone right now.

13:26.520 --> 13:28.160
How much blood are you gonna need?

13:28.190 --> 13:30.390
Take a lot.

13:30.430 --> 13:31.600
Whatever you don't use,
just put it in a jug.

13:31.630 --> 13:33.800
And send to my house.

13:33.830 --> 13:35.070
Get out.

13:35.100 --> 13:39.640
No. I'm leaving.

13:39.670 --> 13:42.970
Hey, my heart's got a nice beat going.

13:46.580 --> 13:50.150
Go heartbeat. Yeah.

13:50.180 --> 13:51.350
Mmm-hmm.

13:51.380 --> 13:51.780
Listen.

13:51.820 --> 13:54.080
I'm starring in a
play tonight at 7:30.

13:54.120 --> 13:55.450
I'll be okay to do it, right?

13:55.490 --> 13:56.020
Yeah.

13:56.050 --> 13:58.090
You're only giving one pint of blood.

13:58.120 --> 13:58.890
It'll take a few minutes.

13:58.920 --> 14:01.120
You'll be fine for your play.

14:01.160 --> 14:05.090
Well, who gave him the mustard?

14:05.130 --> 14:05.860
Hi.

14:05.900 --> 14:06.960
We're back.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.730
How was the dude with tuberculosis?

14:08.770 --> 14:12.640
Oh, he just had stupid pneumonia.

14:12.670 --> 14:13.070
Boo.

14:13.100 --> 14:15.940
Ahh!

14:15.970 --> 14:18.110
Was that loud?

14:18.140 --> 14:20.140
Will you let me know when
you're about to stick.

14:20.180 --> 14:22.880
The needle in my... ♪ oh
and there's a needle ♪

14:22.910 --> 14:25.880
♪ in my arm ♪

14:25.920 --> 14:29.050
Hey, hey, I need to learn the
proper way to cough and hack.

14:29.090 --> 14:31.550
Are there any patients with
tuberculosis in this hospital?

14:31.590 --> 14:33.620
Seventh floor, north wing.

14:33.660 --> 14:34.490
Thank you.

14:34.520 --> 14:36.590
Get away from me.

14:36.630 --> 14:37.590
Cat, come with me.

14:37.630 --> 14:39.590
Don't bother sick people.

14:39.630 --> 14:40.160
Bye.

14:40.200 --> 14:44.960
Ahh!

14:45.000 --> 14:47.670
Let's see. Oh.

14:47.700 --> 14:52.810
Stage three tuberculosis, score.

14:52.840 --> 14:54.840
Hey, hey, hey.

14:54.880 --> 14:57.110
Sir, sir, shut up.

14:57.150 --> 14:58.150
Shh-shh-shh-shut up.

14:58.180 --> 14:59.180
Shut up. Shut up. Shh-shh.

14:59.210 --> 15:01.480
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

15:01.520 --> 15:05.250
Do you mind if I record
your coughing and hacking?

15:05.290 --> 15:10.190
I'm Cat.

15:10.230 --> 15:15.190
Yes. Hack it up. Okay.

15:15.230 --> 15:16.330
I'm gonna try it just like that.

15:16.360 --> 15:29.980
Yeah.

15:30.010 --> 15:33.050
Hey, do me a favor and take
this blood to O.R. room 15?

15:33.080 --> 15:34.710
Kid named Robbie Shapiro
needs it for surgery.

15:34.750 --> 15:35.150
No problem.

15:35.180 --> 15:37.120
I'll take it up as soon as
I'm done filling this up.

15:37.150 --> 15:37.880
Thanks.

15:37.920 --> 15:40.390
Ooh, still warm.

15:40.420 --> 15:41.810
Don't be creepy.

15:46.050 --> 15:47.010
Watch your back.

15:47.490 --> 15:49.220
Food coming through.

16:02.120 --> 16:05.920
One pint of my blood - Gone. Does it miss me??

16:05.920 --> 16:09.300
Soon I shall be Steamboat Suzy!

16:09.300 --> 16:11.800
Feeling: Pumped.

16:13.120 --> 16:23.070
This should take the pressure
off his lower abdomen.

16:23.100 --> 16:25.700
Interesting.

16:25.740 --> 16:26.500
Is that better?

16:26.540 --> 16:28.270
Yeah. Thanks, doc.

16:28.310 --> 16:29.270
So you gave blood?

16:29.310 --> 16:30.270
A whole pint.

16:30.310 --> 16:32.910
You are ready for surgification.

16:32.940 --> 16:34.480
Who's sweet like Taffy?

16:34.510 --> 16:35.510
I don't know.

16:35.550 --> 16:36.680
It's you.

16:36.710 --> 16:38.650
You're silly.

16:38.680 --> 16:41.080
Dr. Schneider, please
call the nurses' station.

16:41.120 --> 16:43.450
Dr. Schneider, please
call the nurses' station.

16:43.490 --> 16:45.920
You lost her blood?

16:45.960 --> 16:46.620
What?

16:46.660 --> 16:47.420
It wasn't my fault.

16:47.460 --> 16:50.830
It was that creepy male nurse with a beard.

16:50.860 --> 16:52.330
But, we got to have
type o-negative blood.

16:52.360 --> 16:53.800
Or we can't operate on this boy.

16:53.830 --> 16:59.270
I understand. I understand.

16:59.310 --> 17:04.010
Do you mind giving us
another pint of blood?

17:04.040 --> 17:05.640
Another whole pint?

17:05.680 --> 17:07.180
Is that safe?

17:07.210 --> 17:12.480
Oh, sure.

17:12.520 --> 17:14.619
Will she still make it
back for her play on time?

17:14.650 --> 17:16.390
It starts at 7:30.

17:16.420 --> 17:18.920
I'm steamboat Suzy.

17:18.960 --> 17:24.730
Won't be a problem.

17:24.760 --> 17:28.130
Let's go.

17:28.170 --> 17:30.700
Don't worry, you'll be better soon.

17:30.730 --> 17:31.730
Thanks, Tori.

17:31.770 --> 17:34.670
Um, and, Robbie...
Yeah?

17:34.710 --> 17:43.950
Spongebob underwear?

17:43.980 --> 17:44.680
All right.

17:44.720 --> 17:45.780
Double time, people.

17:45.820 --> 17:49.920
This play starts in less than
one of your earth hours.

17:49.960 --> 17:50.660
We're back.

17:50.690 --> 17:52.020
Cat, hurry.

17:52.060 --> 17:53.590
Go help sinjin with the lighting cues.

17:53.630 --> 17:54.590
Kay-kay.

17:54.630 --> 17:55.290
Where's Tori?

17:55.330 --> 17:56.100
Still at the hospital.

17:56.130 --> 17:57.330
What?

17:57.370 --> 17:59.130
They lost her blood, so
they're takin' some more.

17:59.170 --> 18:01.530
Well, she better bleed fast.

18:01.570 --> 18:02.870
And where is Jade?

18:02.900 --> 18:05.400
Somebody looking for the
best dang steamboat Captain.

18:05.440 --> 18:08.270
This here River's ever seen?

18:08.310 --> 18:10.170
Why are you wearing Tori's dress?

18:10.210 --> 18:12.580
'Cause she's playing hospital,
so I'm playing Suzy.

18:12.610 --> 18:14.580
Tori's gonna be back in plenty a'time.

18:14.610 --> 18:23.120
Oh, then I'll just keep her dress warm.

18:23.160 --> 18:29.030
Ahh, now that cough sounded nice
and thick like cottage cheese.

18:29.060 --> 18:30.560
Very realistic.

18:30.600 --> 18:34.330
Yeah, 'cause a diseased man
really gave me tuberculosis.

18:34.370 --> 18:36.170
Yes.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.980
If you believe that, the audience will too.

18:41.070 --> 18:44.140
Giving another pint of blood now.

18:44.140 --> 18:47.330
Then on my way to Steamboat Suzy!!!

18:47.330 --> 18:50.330
Feeling: Relieved.

18:51.250 --> 18:51.920
All done?

18:51.950 --> 18:53.520
All done.

18:53.560 --> 18:54.660
Good.

18:54.690 --> 18:56.620
Wow, two pints of blood in one day.

18:56.660 --> 18:57.060
Yeah.

18:57.090 --> 18:58.790
So you better drink your
juice and eat your cookie.

18:58.830 --> 19:00.990
So you won't feel faint.

19:01.030 --> 19:04.600
But you ate my cookie.

19:04.630 --> 19:12.140
Just drink your juice.

19:12.170 --> 19:17.610
Hey, there's my little blood angel.

19:17.650 --> 19:19.550
Robbie, why are you out of bed?

19:19.580 --> 19:20.110
I don't know.

19:20.150 --> 19:23.520
I just felt kind of bad that you
had to give more blood for me.

19:23.550 --> 19:26.720
No worries, already done.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.390
Thar she is.

19:28.420 --> 19:33.760
Oh yeah. Let me see. Wow.

19:33.800 --> 19:37.560
It's like I'm holding
liquid you in my hands.

19:37.600 --> 19:40.400
Okay.

19:40.440 --> 19:41.030
Oh sweet.

19:41.070 --> 19:42.470
Did you know if you hold
blood up against the light,

19:42.510 --> 19:45.000
you can totally see all the...

19:49.180 --> 19:53.160
- I, um...
- Get the nurse.

19:53.160 --> 19:54.550
We'll get the nurse.

19:58.530 --> 20:00.190
Faster.

20:02.530 --> 20:06.590
Now I gotta give another pint of blood!

20:06.590 --> 20:09.910
How will I be Steamboat Suzy?!?!?

20:09.910 --> 20:11.830
Feeling: Freaked Out.

20:14.990 --> 20:16.530
We're not...

20:16.900 --> 20:19.100
We're not docking.

20:19.140 --> 20:21.130
I'll park the boaty.

20:21.930 --> 20:25.740
- You...
- Yikes, Tori does not look good.

20:25.780 --> 20:27.510
Agreed.

20:27.550 --> 20:29.050
It's not her fault.

20:29.080 --> 20:33.520
They took three pints of blood out of her.

20:37.060 --> 20:42.200
That little... that little girl is sick.

20:42.230 --> 20:45.580
Help me. Please help me.

20:46.590 --> 20:52.040
- We got to get her to...
- New Orleans.

20:52.070 --> 20:58.810
New more beans by darg-bark.

20:58.850 --> 21:00.050
Help.

21:00.080 --> 21:01.350
You can't Captain the boat.

21:01.380 --> 21:02.550
You're just a woman.

21:02.580 --> 21:07.820
You... you made me a woman,
but that doesn't mean

21:07.860 --> 21:13.230
I'm not the best ding-dang robot
Captain that this River's ever.

21:39.490 --> 21:40.790
Poor Tori.

21:40.830 --> 21:41.890
Yeah.

21:41.930 --> 21:42.830
I'll go get her dress off.

21:42.860 --> 21:45.300
No.

21:45.330 --> 21:47.600
She can't play the role,
and I'm the understudy.

21:47.630 --> 21:48.730
I don't care.

21:48.770 --> 21:50.870
You've been acting like a gank all week.

21:50.900 --> 21:53.600
I'm not going to reward you
by letting you play the lead.

21:53.640 --> 21:55.310
There's an audience out there.

21:55.340 --> 21:58.170
The show must go on.

21:58.210 --> 22:02.410
Yes. Yes, it must.

22:02.450 --> 22:06.280
And must it shall.

22:06.320 --> 22:07.880
