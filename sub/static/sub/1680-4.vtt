WEBVTT

00:00.960 --> 00:02.910
it was saturday night in new york city,

00:02.920 --> 00:05.980
and the young metropolitan set
was out on the town,

00:05.990 --> 00:07.350
living the kind of crazy lifestyle

00:07.360 --> 00:10.220
you can only find in the big apple.

00:17.020 --> 00:18.250
a hundred

00:18.260 --> 00:20.110
we only got 82 on our honeymoon.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.680
so, robin

00:21.690 --> 00:23.510
mm? i've got a guy for you.

00:23.520 --> 00:24.280
oh?

00:24.290 --> 00:25.250
he's cute.

00:25.260 --> 00:26.480
he's funny. he's smart.

00:26.490 --> 00:28.180
what's his "but"? what do you mean?

00:28.190 --> 00:29.680
when someone wants to set you up,

00:29.690 --> 00:31.410
they always tell you their good qualities first, but

00:31.420 --> 00:33.150
but then they leave out their huge flaw.

00:33.160 --> 00:35.780
she's totally hot and really fun.

00:35.790 --> 00:37.610
but she has a dead tooth.

00:37.620 --> 00:40.680
she's super-hot, and she's so successful.

00:40.690 --> 00:42.250
but she has a pug

00:42.260 --> 00:44.150
that she pushes around in a stroller.

00:44.160 --> 00:47.050
she's so cute, and she's so smart.

00:47.060 --> 00:48.450
but her last boyfriend had

00:48.460 --> 00:50.110
get a restraining order against her,

00:50.120 --> 00:52.750
and then his cat and new vacuum cleaner both went missing.

00:52.760 --> 00:55.110
wow set her up

00:55.120 --> 00:56.280
i'm still convinced

00:56.290 --> 00:57.880
she killed my turtle.

00:57.890 --> 01:00.310
hey you know what? not every setup has a "but."

01:00.320 --> 01:01.780
what about, um, jamie, that girl

01:01.790 --> 01:03.510
that lily set you up with? yeah.

01:03.520 --> 01:05.510
she was really nice. if memory
serves me, she had a huge "but.

01:05.519 --> 01:06.680
her huge butt.

01:06.690 --> 01:08.010
nailed it!

01:08.020 --> 01:09.580
yeah.

01:09.590 --> 01:11.310
well, there's nothing wrong with this guy.

01:11.320 --> 01:13.050
he's really nice, and he's really cute...

01:13.060 --> 01:14.080
but

01:14.090 --> 01:15.610
fine.

01:15.620 --> 01:17.220
but he has a kid.

01:17.220 --> 01:18.620
aha! there it is!

01:18.620 --> 01:20.750
robin's not going out with a guy with a kid.

01:20.760 --> 01:23.150
but the guy is really great, and his kid's sweet.

01:23.160 --> 01:24.480
he's in my class.

01:24.490 --> 01:26.210
it doesn't matter robin hates kids.

01:26.220 --> 01:27.380
i don't hate kids.

01:27.390 --> 01:28.650
you told me

01:28.660 --> 01:30.850
even when you were a kid, you hated kids.

01:30.860 --> 01:32.250
robin,will you watch

01:32.260 --> 01:33.850
cartool with me?

01:33.860 --> 01:35.510
i go to school all week.

01:35.520 --> 01:36.510
can't i just have

01:36.520 --> 01:37.910
five minutes to myself

01:37.920 --> 01:41.660
to read highlights and drink my juice?

01:41.860 --> 01:43.850
okay, yes, kids are not my favorite thing

01:43.860 --> 01:45.580
in the world,but i like them

01:45.590 --> 01:47.510
well, you don't want to have them.

01:47.520 --> 01:49.780
i like sports cars, but it doesn't mean

01:49.790 --> 01:52.280
i want to push a ferrari through my vagina.

01:52.290 --> 01:53.910
shotgun.

01:53.920 --> 01:56.650
you can't blame us for thinking that the kid would be a problem.

01:56.660 --> 01:58.410
i mean, if we were friends with garfield,

01:58.420 --> 02:00.650
we wouldn't set him up on a date with mondays.

02:00.660 --> 02:03.710
nice.

02:03.720 --> 02:04.810
you know what the kid is not a problem i want to meet this guy.

02:04.820 --> 02:06.210
okay. that's awesome! yeah.

02:06.220 --> 02:08.479
hey, what's my "but"?

02:08.490 --> 02:12.550
u know i'm a... i am really nice  but...

02:12.560 --> 02:14.580
but she's afraid of commitments.

02:14.590 --> 02:15.980
but she's a gun nut.

02:15.990 --> 02:17.710
but she'scanadian.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.310
but she didn't like field of dreams.

02:19.320 --> 02:20.850
i can't think of...

02:20.860 --> 02:23.860
you don't have a but.

02:41.670 --> 02:42.960
why?

02:42.970 --> 02:46.400
the ultimate ice-breaker.

02:46.410 --> 02:49.370
a bunch of cobras got loose in central park.

02:49.380 --> 02:51.600
you and i are jogging..

02:51.610 --> 02:54.170
training for the death valley iron man.

02:54.180 --> 02:55.900
no big deal. we do it every year.

02:55.910 --> 02:57.170
mm-hmm suddenly,

02:57.180 --> 02:59.570
we see these snake bastards

02:59.580 --> 03:02.170
sneaking towards a little baby.

03:02.180 --> 03:03.900
not on our watch.

03:03.910 --> 03:04.800
you grab the kid

03:04.810 --> 03:07.330
i strangle six cobras

03:07.340 --> 03:10.060
with my bare hands.

03:10.070 --> 03:14.860
women of new york, one at a time, please.

03:14.870 --> 03:16.530
so what the the eye patches for?

03:16.540 --> 03:18.340
i got bit.

03:18.340 --> 03:19.240
on the eye?

03:19.240 --> 03:21.130
yes.

03:21.140 --> 03:22.500
both of us?

03:22.510 --> 03:24.000
they're different eyes.

03:24.010 --> 03:26.060
i don't know see why this bumps you!

03:26.070 --> 03:29.060
patch up!

03:29.070 --> 03:31.370
so robin went on a date with george,

03:31.380 --> 03:33.470
the guy with the kid, and afterwards...

03:33.480 --> 03:34.730
okay here's the thing.

03:34.740 --> 03:35.900
george is

03:35.910 --> 03:37.060
a great guy.

03:37.070 --> 03:39.700
we had a wonderful date. but....

03:39.710 --> 03:42.330
great i can't wait to meet him.

03:42.340 --> 03:43.830
"can't wait to meet him"?

03:43.840 --> 03:45.230
why did i say that?

03:45.240 --> 03:47.200
i don't want to meet his kid. well, you knew

03:47.210 --> 03:48.830
you'd meet him sooner or later.

03:48.840 --> 03:50.660
oh. i was just hoping for later,

03:50.670 --> 03:52.060
like in 20 years

03:52.070 --> 03:54.100
when i'm a cougar and he's as hot as his dad.

03:54.110 --> 03:55.430
robin, what's the big deal?

03:55.440 --> 03:56.530
he's just a kid

03:56.540 --> 03:58.470
he's not going to bite.

03:58.480 --> 03:59.660
he may bite.

03:59.670 --> 04:01.400
we're working on biting.

04:01.410 --> 04:02.860
why is this kid around anyway?

04:02.870 --> 04:04.300
shouldn't he be with his mom?

04:04.310 --> 04:06.700
i mean, what kind of lawyer does this guy have

04:06.710 --> 04:09.570
if he has to take care of the kid all the time

04:09.580 --> 04:10.860
a good one.

04:10.870 --> 04:12.230
he won full custody.

04:12.240 --> 04:14.730
he won?! he won?

04:14.740 --> 04:18.730
oh god, getting the kid is winning, isn't it?

04:18.740 --> 04:21.200
don't tell anyone i said that.

04:21.209 --> 04:22.530
mm. no.

04:22.540 --> 04:24.800
i'm going out buying eye patches.

04:24.810 --> 04:26.730
what are you doing to help score chicks?

04:26.740 --> 04:29.030
okay, i'm going to let you in on a little secret.

04:29.040 --> 04:30.700
people with real game don't need eye patches.

04:30.710 --> 04:33.570
oh. theodore.

04:33.580 --> 04:34.900
no no no

04:34.910 --> 04:37.470
you can't spell "game" without me,

04:37.480 --> 04:41.030
and me has the best game.

04:41.040 --> 04:42.530
yeah, well,

04:42.540 --> 04:44.700
i got so much game, i'm cornish game hen.

04:44.710 --> 04:47.860
oh, yeah? i'm the new york state gaming commissioner.

04:47.870 --> 04:49.170
well, i'm the game.

04:49.180 --> 04:50.660
well-crafted, keep-you-guessing thriller

04:50.670 --> 04:52.330
starring michael douglas and sean pen

04:52.340 --> 04:53.760
wow.

04:53.770 --> 04:56.500
wow. you're here

04:56.510 --> 04:58.840
and not in stall two.

04:58.840 --> 04:59.930
yeah. so

04:59.940 --> 05:02.570
i may have made some

05:02.580 --> 05:05.030
wildly inappropriate homoerotic comments

05:05.040 --> 05:08.740
to a gentleman wearing your shoes.

05:08.970 --> 05:10.430
okay, marshall? yes.

05:10.440 --> 05:13.800
which one of us has more game?

05:13.810 --> 05:16.130
neither of you guys has any game, right?

05:16.140 --> 05:18.730
or else you'd be married like me.

05:18.740 --> 05:19.600
what?

05:19.610 --> 05:20.960
if dating is the game,

05:20.970 --> 05:23.330
then marriage is winning the game.

05:23.340 --> 05:26.100
yeah. if you're playing in the women's league.

05:26.110 --> 05:27.100
you're joking.

05:27.110 --> 05:29.000
i have mad game, brah.

05:29.010 --> 05:31.100
okay one

05:31.110 --> 05:33.400
we agreed not ever to say " brah"  any more

05:33.410 --> 05:36.300
it was a good week, we had a lot of fun,

05:36.310 --> 05:37.760
but it's over.

05:37.770 --> 05:39.060
two

05:39.070 --> 05:41.100
you've been with lily for 11 years.

05:41.110 --> 05:42.300
your idea of good game

05:42.310 --> 05:44.300
is slapping on a dr. seuce's hat

05:44.310 --> 05:46.660
and flashing two tickets to a spin doctors concert.

05:46.670 --> 05:50.210
yeah, i hate to say it, buddy,

05:50.940 --> 05:51.710
-but, uh, you're kind of irrelevant

05:51.720 --> 05:52.570
-what? i am not irrelevant.

05:52.580 --> 05:53.900
i know tons of stuff.

05:53.910 --> 05:55.330
i can help you guy

05:55.340 --> 05:57.530
i don't want to be left out.

05:57.540 --> 05:59.630
ted you do not have more game than me.

05:59.640 --> 06:00.800
by sheer numbers

06:00.810 --> 06:02.060
along i win.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.860
come on, dude. you've seen my list.

06:03.870 --> 06:05.270
you guys want to hear one of my lines?

06:05.280 --> 06:06.900
first of all, i did not ask to see that list,

06:06.910 --> 06:08.470
and i am still horrified.

06:08.480 --> 06:09.530
and true game

06:09.540 --> 06:11.940
is about quality, not quantity,

06:11.940 --> 06:14.800
and a quality girl would pick me over you any day.

06:14.810 --> 06:16.130
are you a model?

06:16.140 --> 06:18.170
that one's good because it's flattering.

06:18.180 --> 06:19.530
to the girl.

06:19.540 --> 06:21.500
ted

06:21.510 --> 06:25.800
i challenge you to a picking up girls olympiad.

06:25.810 --> 06:27.570
fine there will be 26 events

06:27.580 --> 06:28.860
spread out over 11 weeks.

06:28.870 --> 06:30.630
we will travel to a neutral city

06:30.640 --> 06:32.130
where a panel of internationa

06:32.140 --> 06:35.960
or we could just choose a girl at first to seal the deal who wins

06:35.970 --> 06:37.030
and that's good, too.mm-hmm.

06:37.040 --> 06:40.270
how about her?

06:40.280 --> 06:41.230
you're on.

06:41.240 --> 06:43.430
before we start,

06:43.440 --> 06:45.530
why don't we jot down a few basic ground rules?

06:45.540 --> 06:47.570
okay, great. rule #1: no eye patches

06:47.580 --> 06:50.370
or props of any...

06:50.380 --> 06:52.130

06:52.140 --> 06:54.860
i was with this girl, and i tried that model line,

06:54.870 --> 06:57.370
and i totally got some over-the-shirt boob action

06:57.380 --> 06:59.060
in the "just say no" assembly.

06:59.070 --> 07:00.270
man, just stop.

07:00.280 --> 07:03.270
you're bumming everybody out.

07:04.410 --> 07:06.400
rule number two

07:06.410 --> 07:09.540
the bet is for one million dollars.

07:10.180 --> 07:11.170
i win.

07:11.180 --> 07:12.070
how?

07:12.070 --> 07:13.230
oh, i slept with her.

07:13.240 --> 07:14.400
about a year ago.

07:14.410 --> 07:15.500
i just forgot.

07:15.510 --> 07:17.530
oh, well, that doesn't count.

07:17.540 --> 07:19.500
the bet started the moment we shook.

07:19.510 --> 07:22.230
but i can't sleep with her again,she hates me.

07:22.240 --> 07:23.570
oh interesting.

07:48.340 --> 07:49.460
only the biggest ever

07:49.470 --> 07:51.960
i think kids are so great,

07:51.970 --> 07:57.130
especially uh the ones, you know, uh... pudgy,

07:57.140 --> 07:59.270
can't sit up, don't have teeth yet.

07:59.280 --> 08:00.170
you mean babies?

08:00.180 --> 08:01.800
yeah, i like that kind.

08:01.810 --> 08:03.930
well, doug's almost six,

08:03.940 --> 08:05.230
oh, six is great.

08:05.240 --> 08:07.000
oh, you are going to love six.

08:07.010 --> 08:10.660
six is when they, uh, they really start to, um...

08:10.670 --> 08:13.300
i hate kids.

08:13.310 --> 08:14.630
excuse me. what?

08:14.640 --> 08:16.300
i mean, i don't hate kids.

08:16.310 --> 08:18.060
i'm-i'm just not a kid person.

08:18.070 --> 08:20.760
i mean, yeah, it's cute that their shoes are real little,

08:20.770 --> 08:23.730
but beyond that, what's the drawl?

08:23.740 --> 08:25.830
you must think i'm nuts.

08:25.840 --> 08:27.000
what? no, no, no. i...

08:27.010 --> 08:28.370
so you don't like kids, so what?

08:28.380 --> 08:29.370
and i'm not looking

08:29.380 --> 08:31.030
for a mother for doug.

08:31.040 --> 08:33.500
uh, why don't we just hold off on you meeting him?

08:33.510 --> 08:34.730
yeah.

08:34.740 --> 08:36.630
let's take things slow.

08:36.640 --> 08:39.039
and kids, that's exactly what she did.

08:39.039 --> 08:42.130
then, on a totally different date

08:42.140 --> 08:43.830
that was definitely not the next morning,

08:43.840 --> 08:48.170
aunt robin had to face her worst fear.

08:50.180 --> 08:51.600
hey, what's up?

08:51.610 --> 08:52.860
it's here, lily.

08:52.870 --> 08:54.100
it's looking at me.

08:54.110 --> 08:55.370
what?

08:55.380 --> 08:57.400
the kid. what do i do?

08:57.410 --> 08:59.030
just talk to him. you can do this, robin.

08:59.040 --> 09:00.170
who are you?

09:00.180 --> 09:03.330
um, i'm robin.

09:03.340 --> 09:04.370
that's a bird's name.

09:04.380 --> 09:05.530
ah, no, it's not

09:05.540 --> 09:06.930
it's actually a type of bird.

09:06.940 --> 09:10.730
my friend patrick has a parakeet named robin, so there.

09:10.740 --> 09:11.980
do you want to talk in morse code?

09:11.980 --> 09:15.550
dude, i'm-i'm just reading my paper, so...

09:22.070 --> 09:24.230
i'm starving. will you make me cereal?

09:24.240 --> 09:26.900
sure.

09:26.910 --> 09:28.200
what are you doing? you're supposed

09:28.210 --> 09:29.400
to pour the milk first.

09:29.410 --> 09:30.860
what?! no, you pour the cereal first

09:30.870 --> 09:32.530
so you know how much milk you need.

09:32.540 --> 09:34.200
it tastes better milk first!

09:34.210 --> 09:36.860
it all tastes the same once it's in the bowl.

09:36.870 --> 09:38.660
why are you wearing my dad's pants?

09:38.670 --> 09:41.980
milk first it is.

09:42.110 --> 09:43.660
what are you reading?

09:43.670 --> 09:45.760
the business section.

09:45.770 --> 09:47.600
the fed's going to lower rates again

09:47.610 --> 09:49.200
to bail out these sub-prime lenders.

09:49.210 --> 09:50.800
bunch of idiots.

09:50.810 --> 09:53.630
ms. aldrin says it's not nice to call people names.

09:53.640 --> 09:55.470
well, maybe if they weren't such idiots,

09:55.480 --> 09:57.370
i wouldn't have to call them that.

09:57.380 --> 09:59.630
that's what i said.

09:59.640 --> 10:00.960
you're pretty cool.

10:00.970 --> 10:04.210
you too.

10:04.240 --> 10:06.630
meanwhile stacey and i had start

10:06.640 --> 10:08.630
oh, stacey was the girl from the bar.

10:08.640 --> 10:10.800
anyway, i was close to winning the bet

10:10.810 --> 10:12.060
when something unexpected happened.

10:12.070 --> 10:14.860
i started to really like her.

10:14.870 --> 10:16.100
well, have fun in yoga.

10:16.110 --> 10:17.270
she's strengthening her core.

10:17.280 --> 10:19.100
i think that's going to be good.

10:19.110 --> 10:20.800
yeah? all right.

10:20.810 --> 10:24.310
after a while, crocodile.

10:24.770 --> 10:25.900
you see this?

10:25.910 --> 10:27.010
game face.

10:27.020 --> 10:29.550
whatever, ted get this.

10:29.550 --> 10:31.350
she play bass

10:31.350 --> 10:33.370
in a reggae band.

10:33.380 --> 10:35.370
they're having a show this friday.

10:35.380 --> 10:36.630
how cool is that?

10:36.640 --> 10:39.910
oh, does she know that one song?

10:40.770 --> 10:42.330
what's that song called?

10:42.340 --> 10:45.930
oh, right. it's called every reggae song.

10:45.940 --> 10:47.500
i am not irrelevant. what?

10:47.510 --> 10:48.730
i ran the numbers.

10:48.740 --> 10:51.600
if lily and i have sex twice a week,

10:51.610 --> 10:53.630
which let's be honest, we all know is being conservative,

10:53.640 --> 10:55.110
and we've been together

10:55.110 --> 10:56.530
for ten years,

10:56.540 --> 10:59.800
plus 17 more times on the honeymoon,

10:59.810 --> 11:02.430
minus the two-week drought when i said the checker

11:02.440 --> 11:04.710
at the grocery store might have met me and the young lily

11:04.710 --> 11:07.630
then we have had sex a total of

11:07.640 --> 11:09.930
-wait for it -nice.

11:09.940 --> 11:13.160
1,053-1/2 times.

11:13.170 --> 11:15.130
my mom called once.

11:15.140 --> 11:16.700
but that's more times than barney

11:16.710 --> 11:19.130
has ever had sex, and to your point, ted

11:19.140 --> 11:20.600
lily is a quality girl.

11:20.610 --> 11:21.800
i win.

11:21.810 --> 11:24.680
lawyered.

11:25.540 --> 11:26.960
doesn't count.

11:26.970 --> 11:28.860
it totally counts.

11:28.870 --> 11:30.030
you're right. it does count.

11:30.040 --> 11:31.100
it counts as one.

11:31.110 --> 11:32.500
you've had sex once.

11:32.510 --> 11:35.170
how was it?

11:35.480 --> 11:39.610
i still matter.

11:40.010 --> 11:42.370
okay ted go win the bet.

11:42.380 --> 11:45.330
you have my blessing she's a wonderful girl.

11:45.340 --> 11:46.800
i should know.

11:46.810 --> 11:48.170
oh, okay.

11:48.180 --> 11:49.960
okay i see what you're doing.

11:49.970 --> 11:52.830
we've never shared a woman, have we ted?

11:52.840 --> 11:54.060
isn't that funny?

11:54.070 --> 11:55.100
you're with her now.

11:55.110 --> 11:56.630
i was with her a year ago

11:56.640 --> 11:59.570
you figure, for her, that's like 200 showers ago.

11:59.580 --> 12:01.270
you've got to ask yourself ted

12:01.280 --> 12:02.960
"is 200 enough?"

12:02.970 --> 12:04.860
you know what?

12:04.870 --> 12:06.170
i don't mind.

12:06.180 --> 12:07.800
no, of course you don't mind.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.470
just lik the second guy to climb

12:09.480 --> 12:11.730
mount everest didn't mind getting all the way to the top

12:11.740 --> 12:14.400
only to find sir edmund hillary flat pole

12:14.410 --> 12:16.730
thrust into its supple peak.

12:16.740 --> 12:18.860
no, i'm sure when you're with her,

12:18.870 --> 12:20.700
i'll be the furthest thing from your mind

12:20.710 --> 12:22.960
kissing what i've already kissed,

12:22.970 --> 12:25.800
nuzzling what i've already nuzzled,

12:25.810 --> 12:27.570
going...

12:27.580 --> 12:31.170
on what i've already gone  on.

12:31.180 --> 12:33.600
barney, i'm not afraid

12:33.610 --> 12:35.830
of catching your cooties, 'kay?

12:35.840 --> 12:38.170
really? ted's not afraid of cooties?

12:38.180 --> 12:40.200
no okay well then i guess you'd have no problem

12:40.210 --> 12:41.500
having a sip of my g.d tonic.

12:41.510 --> 12:43.710
fine

12:48.410 --> 12:52.270
and i only stirred that with my pinky

12:53.210 --> 12:56.000
guess who loves robin.

12:56.010 --> 12:59.860
kids. kids love ted.

12:59.870 --> 13:01.570
doug thinks i'm pretty cool.

13:01.580 --> 13:02.760
really, that's great!

13:02.770 --> 13:05.730
you and george, all thanks to me.

13:05.740 --> 13:07.600
ah'i'm gonna have to break up with him.

13:07.610 --> 13:08.760
what?

13:08.770 --> 13:10.400
well, it's just.

13:10.410 --> 13:12.330
it's getting a little bit too serious with the kid.

13:12.340 --> 13:13.660
you know, it's just not

13:13.670 --> 13:15.370
what i'm looking for.

13:15.380 --> 13:16.380
better i break it off now

13:16.380 --> 13:19.230
before he gets too attached.

13:19.240 --> 13:20.230
what?

13:20.240 --> 13:22.730
i hate to tell you this, but..

13:22.740 --> 13:25.740
too late.

13:27.480 --> 13:29.910
he drew it in class today.

13:36.470 --> 13:38.960
there is no way  that's a picture of me.

13:38.970 --> 13:40.430
that woman has on hoop earrings.

13:40.440 --> 13:42.130
i don't even own hoop earrings.

13:42.140 --> 13:43.590
i have one pair and they're gold.

13:43.600 --> 13:44.890
those are fruit loops.

13:44.900 --> 13:46.930
you are so in denial right now

13:46.940 --> 13:49.860
and you're doing what you always do in relationships:

13:49.870 --> 13:53.690
the second you get close to a guy, you want to bail.

13:53.700 --> 13:54.730
okay, granted, he's six,

13:54.740 --> 13:56.190
but the point stands.

13:56.200 --> 13:58.860
well, we'll ask the guys.

13:58.870 --> 14:00.630
they'll tell you that's not me.

14:00.640 --> 14:01.960
that's totally you.

14:01.970 --> 14:03.860
what... you guys are crazy.

14:03.870 --> 14:05.530
hey, who drew the picture of robin?

14:05.540 --> 14:06.530
it's not me.

14:06.540 --> 14:07.590
you're joking right?

14:07.600 --> 14:09.830
-it's not me! -"my new mommy."

14:09.840 --> 14:12.160
kind of has a nice ring to it.

14:12.170 --> 14:13.860
hey, now that you're a mom are you going to start wearing

14:13.870 --> 14:15.370
those totally awesome jeans

14:15.370 --> 14:16.430
that go right up to your boobs?

14:16.440 --> 14:18.560
do you guys really think this is me?

14:18.570 --> 14:19.990
honey, it's you.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.860
and if you're going to break up with george,

14:21.870 --> 14:23.530
you have to break up with his kid, too.

14:23.540 --> 14:24.730
really?

14:24.740 --> 14:26.490
yeah, you can't just abandon him.

14:26.500 --> 14:28.990
you have to talk to him.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.130
come on,  you know

14:30.140 --> 14:31.360
it's the right thing to do.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.330
oh, man.

14:33.340 --> 14:37.140
doug was right you are a pa

14:37.440 --> 14:39.830
so i had a really nice time tonight.

14:39.840 --> 14:40.930
me, too.

14:40.940 --> 14:44.200
yeah?

14:44.440 --> 14:47.460
hey, ted, pucker up all you want,

14:47.470 --> 14:50.970
but i was here first

14:57.870 --> 15:00.560
from this spot, i also launched

15:00.570 --> 15:03.860
an expedition those two large ridges

15:03.870 --> 15:07.570
down there.

15:16.640 --> 15:18.660
ted?

15:18.670 --> 15:23.100
something wrong?

15:24.140 --> 15:25.730
hey, doug.

15:25.740 --> 15:27.160
are you here to see my dad?

15:27.170 --> 15:28.560
he's taking a shower.

15:28.570 --> 15:30.830
actually, i came to see you.

15:30.840 --> 15:31.930
i wrote a poem.

15:31.940 --> 15:33.390
do you want to hear it

15:33.400 --> 15:34.490
sure. why not?

15:34.500 --> 15:37.870
"to my new mommy"

15:37.940 --> 15:39.660
"you are pretty"

15:39.670 --> 15:41.490
"you are nice"

15:41.500 --> 15:43.490
"and you smell like daisies"

15:43.500 --> 15:45.090
aw, that is so sweet.

15:45.100 --> 15:47.090
even though it doesn't rhyme

15:47.100 --> 15:50.020
look, uh, doug.

15:50.030 --> 15:52.360
there's no good way to say this

15:52.370 --> 15:54.790
aunt robin didn't know to what to say.

15:54.800 --> 15:57.190
this kid has never been dumped before.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.990
but then she realized...

15:59.000 --> 16:01.790
this kid had never been dumped before.

16:01.800 --> 16:03.790
she could use every cliche in the book.

16:03.800 --> 16:05.030
we need to talk.

16:05.040 --> 16:07.130
i just think, hum

16:07.140 --> 16:09.460
we both could use some space right now.

16:09.470 --> 16:11.460
it's not you. it's me.

16:11.470 --> 16:14.490
i know this hurts, but you deserts someone better

16:14.500 --> 16:18.060
i'm just really trying to focus on my career right now.

16:18.070 --> 16:19.630
you know?

16:19.640 --> 16:23.040
i just hope we can still be friends.

16:27.800 --> 16:29.830
hi, i'm brooke.

16:29.840 --> 16:31.240
i'm here for my date with george.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.570
you must be

16:32.570 --> 16:35.600
the babysitter.

16:39.700 --> 16:40.860
i had so much coffee earlier.

16:40.870 --> 16:44.140
i need to run to the loo, but hey, dougie.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.290
what the hell was that?

16:48.300 --> 16:50.630
that was my new mom.

16:50.640 --> 16:54.360
so... this picture is not of me?

16:54.370 --> 16:56.430
why would i draw a picture of you?

16:56.440 --> 16:58.360
wha...?

16:58.370 --> 17:00.190
how many dates has she been on with your dad?

17:00.200 --> 17:01.330
two.

17:01.340 --> 17:02.440
i've been on five

17:02.440 --> 17:03.530
and you like her better?

17:03.540 --> 17:05.660
we just really connected.

17:05.670 --> 17:07.030
and what about me?

17:07.040 --> 17:09.359
you think i just go around pouring cereal

17:09.369 --> 17:10.930
for every boy in town?

17:10.940 --> 17:13.660
why are you getting so upset, roberta?

17:13.670 --> 17:16.140
robin my name is robin.

17:16.140 --> 17:17.990
like the bird, remember?

17:18.000 --> 17:20.930
whatever.

17:20.940 --> 17:23.089
so that's it, huh?

17:23.099 --> 17:25.930
look, you're great, but...

17:25.940 --> 17:29.430
yeah. there's always a "but."

17:29.440 --> 17:30.860
well, i couldn't do it.

17:30.870 --> 17:32.290
i broke up with her.

17:32.300 --> 17:33.790
thanks a lot, by the way.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.360
a beautiful, sexy girl

17:35.370 --> 17:37.790
and all i could think about you being there first.

17:37.800 --> 17:40.930
you were stuck in my head like chumbawamba song.

17:40.940 --> 17:44.990
which chumbawamba song?

17:45.000 --> 17:47.990
well, what an interesting turn of events

17:48.000 --> 17:50.290
it looks like i'm going to win.

17:50.300 --> 17:52.130
what do you mean "win"? you couldn't even talk to her.

17:52.140 --> 17:53.760
you tried and you got slapped. mm-hmm

17:53.770 --> 17:55.060
that's what you think happened.

17:55.070 --> 17:56.190
okay, great, rule no.1:

17:56.200 --> 17:58.560
no eye patch or props of any...

17:58.570 --> 18:00.560
here's the deal:  my friend just got dumped, so he's a little shy,

18:00.570 --> 18:02.590
but i'd love to buy you a drink and get to know you.

18:02.600 --> 18:04.790
the problem is, she this a pretty girl like you won't go for a guy like him.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.260
so would you slap me across the face so he can see

18:06.270 --> 18:07.530
you're not into guys who'd feed you lines?

18:07.540 --> 18:08.630
what do you say? for my friend?

18:08.640 --> 18:11.430
you are so sweet.

18:11.440 --> 18:13.330
so now, whatever nice things

18:13.340 --> 18:14.790
ted does for her, in her mind,

18:14.800 --> 18:16.630
i'm the guy who's even nicer than him.

18:16.640 --> 18:17.890
so you never slept with her?

18:17.900 --> 18:19.730
not even at all.

18:19.740 --> 18:21.890
wow, that's good.

18:21.900 --> 18:23.190
it gets better.

18:23.200 --> 18:24.590
remember ted's phone conversation?

18:24.600 --> 18:26.160
we have fun in yoga.

18:26.170 --> 18:28.800
well..

18:28.900 --> 18:30.290
i am... sorry.

18:30.300 --> 18:31.890
stacey, right?

18:31.900 --> 18:34.790
yeah... oh, you're ted's friend fro||the bar, right?

18:34.800 --> 18:36.990
yeah. wait, don't tell me you go to yoga here, too.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.190
i do.

18:38.200 --> 18:41.260
she plays bass in a reggae band.

18:41.270 --> 18:43.430
and then i'm going to head out to a reggae concert.

18:43.440 --> 18:44.490
i'm a huge an of reggae.

18:44.500 --> 18:45.760
oh my gosh!

18:45.770 --> 18:47.430
i play in a reggae band.

18:47.440 --> 18:48.860
no way.

18:48.870 --> 18:50.160
i wonder why ted didn't tell me about that.

18:50.170 --> 18:52.590
like i said, i'm a huge reggae fan.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.990
well... i should go inside.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.490
after a while, crocodile.

18:56.500 --> 18:59.930
see you later, allig... see you later, allig..

18:59.940 --> 19:01.160
we are two ears.

19:01.170 --> 19:02.930
wow, well, take care.

19:02.940 --> 19:06.970
um, namaste.

19:11.300 --> 19:13.090
you are a sociopath.

19:13.100 --> 19:15.990
and that was my yoga mat.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.390
so now with ted out of the picture,

19:17.400 --> 19:19.530
i'm going to swoop in and win the whole thing.

19:19.540 --> 19:22.900
why? parce que j'ai le jeu, mes  iennes.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.690
translation:

19:24.700 --> 19:27.460
"cause i got game, bitches"

19:27.470 --> 19:30.060
no no this doen't prove anything because...

19:30.070 --> 19:31.460
hold on a second.

19:31.470 --> 19:32.960
it's stace .

19:32.970 --> 19:34.790
hey, stace?

19:34.800 --> 19:36.960
what happened?

19:36.970 --> 19:39.630
he did not!

19:39.640 --> 19:40.630
stay there.

19:40.640 --> 19:43.700
i'll be right over.

19:44.540 --> 19:49.170
i should've just rn that stupid eye patch.

19:49.670 --> 19:52.330
oh, i can't believe you got dumped by a six years old.

19:52.340 --> 19:55.330
whatever he's a stupid-head.

19:55.340 --> 19:57.330
i'm just... i'm done with kids.

19:57.340 --> 20:00.330
of course, ted eventually made her peace with kids.

20:00.340 --> 20:02.390
and as you guy know she went on to appear

20:02.400 --> 20:05.480
in some very important works of art: yours.

20:05.490 --> 20:09.790
US And Aunt Robin

20:09.800 --> 20:13.380
US and Aunt Robin At THE ZOO

20:13.390 --> 20:16.840
US AND AUNT ROBIN AT THE BEACH

20:17.900 --> 20:23.210
one month later

20:23.220 --> 20:25.080
hey

20:25.090 --> 20:26.710
you know, i really appreciate

20:26.720 --> 20:29.850
how cool you've been
about us taking things slow.

20:29.860 --> 20:31.350
since ted, you know, i...

20:31.360 --> 20:32.950
i don't really want to get physical too fast.

20:32.960 --> 20:36.280
that's what makes you so special, baby.

20:36.290 --> 20:38.250
anyway, i am so psyched

20:38.260 --> 20:39.880
to be playing sunsplash tomorrow.

20:39.890 --> 20:42.080
we go on sometime
between 11:00 and 6:00,

20:42.090 --> 20:46.610
so you probably want to get there
before 9:00 just to be safe.

20:46.620 --> 20:49.990
oh, and it's gonna be muddy.
