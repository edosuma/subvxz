WEBVTT

00:04.045 --> 00:05.680
So how did you get
so good with this?

00:05.714 --> 00:07.307
Mechanics and all?

00:08.132 --> 00:09.642
Uh, my dad.

00:10.260 --> 00:12.311
Before he decided to
start hitting me.

00:13.930 --> 00:16.441
Ugh! Come here. I could
use your help for a sec.

00:19.602 --> 00:20.737
All right.

00:21.354 --> 00:22.488
Ah!

00:22.814 --> 00:24.041
I can see you've
done this before.

00:24.065 --> 00:26.743
Well, I don't usually like
to get my hands dirty.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.121
God, I sound like
such a princess.

00:30.238 --> 00:32.466
No, it's good for you,
grease under the nails.

00:32.490 --> 00:33.958
It'll make a man out of you.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.210
Well, that has
always been my goal.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.757
There. Done.

00:44.127 --> 00:45.261
Here.

00:52.927 --> 00:54.071
Do you wanna, uh...

00:54.095 --> 00:55.772
You wanna take her
for a test-drive?

00:55.805 --> 00:57.190
Oh, um...

00:57.515 --> 00:59.692
Well, I have to meet
everybody at the restaurant.

01:00.310 --> 01:02.153
It's kind of this thing we do.

01:02.771 --> 01:04.113
You wanna come with?

01:05.732 --> 01:07.116
Uh, no.

01:08.651 --> 01:10.745
Um, anyway...

01:12.000 --> 01:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:25.710 --> 01:27.678
I'm really not all that hungry.

01:30.757 --> 01:32.850
Claud. Claudia!

01:33.760 --> 01:36.030
Claud? Stick to the violin.

01:36.054 --> 01:38.157
I'm starving. Where is she?

01:38.181 --> 01:39.857
Here. There's a boy.

01:41.643 --> 01:45.122
Manning, your drinks have been
on the bar since Tuesday.

01:45.146 --> 01:46.290
This isn't really like her.

01:46.314 --> 01:48.292
It is since she's been
hanging out with Griffin.

01:48.316 --> 01:51.337
I mean, He's kind of sexy
and everything, but...

01:51.361 --> 01:52.537
Sexy?

01:53.029 --> 01:55.289
Sexy, Claud? What do... What
do you know about sexy?

01:55.490 --> 01:57.208
Charlie! We're eating!

01:57.283 --> 01:58.668
Hi there, kids.

01:58.827 --> 02:02.890
I had Tony get a jump on
your usual, uh, salads.

02:02.914 --> 02:04.225
You're still winded, Joe?

02:04.249 --> 02:07.103
I should have skipped the
manicotti for lunch.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.469
So listen, Tony.

02:08.669 --> 02:10.689
You gotta take care of
your regular customers.

02:10.713 --> 02:13.099
Come on. These are very important people.
All right.

02:13.258 --> 02:14.985
The Caesar goes to Kirsten.

02:15.009 --> 02:17.238
House, no tomato,
goes to Charlie.

02:17.262 --> 02:21.826
The chopped romaine with
radish roses goes to Claudia.

02:21.850 --> 02:23.452
I got you three of those
today, sweetheart.

02:23.476 --> 02:24.453
Thanks, Joe.

02:24.477 --> 02:25.996
"House" house goes to Bailey.

02:26.020 --> 02:27.039
- Thanks.
- All right.

02:27.063 --> 02:30.199
And Tony, Tony.
Table eight, huh?

02:30.358 --> 02:32.660
Thank you. Okay. There you go.

02:33.278 --> 02:36.956
So Julia's out with
Justin again tonight?

02:37.073 --> 02:39.426
I wish. I bet she's not coming.

02:39.450 --> 02:42.003
Uh-oh! Trouble in paradise.

02:42.954 --> 02:44.014
Joe, you all right?

02:44.038 --> 02:45.214
Here, sit down.

02:45.290 --> 02:46.433
God, Joe, you look terrible.

02:46.457 --> 02:48.718
No, no. I'm fine. I'm fine.

02:49.085 --> 02:54.525
I think that, uh, Felipe went a
little crazy with the garlic.

02:54.549 --> 02:55.734
Ugh!

02:55.758 --> 02:57.528
Joe.

02:57.552 --> 02:58.988
- My God!
- Joe! What's the matter?

02:59.012 --> 03:00.855
Joe! Joe?

03:01.890 --> 03:03.158
It's okay, now, Joe.

03:03.182 --> 03:05.160
- Tony, call 911.
- God, hurry!

03:05.184 --> 03:06.287
Just hang in there, Joe.

03:06.311 --> 03:07.705
- Ch-Charlie.
- You're gonna be okay.

03:07.729 --> 03:08.946
Charlie.

03:20.533 --> 03:22.136

03:46.559 --> 03:49.403
Yeah. Joe Mangus,
please, room 32-11.

03:50.563 --> 03:51.665
Sure, I'll hold.

03:51.689 --> 03:52.958
How's he doing? Any word?

03:52.982 --> 03:54.627
Charlie's trying to find out.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.212
Ask him when he can
have visitors.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.204
Yeah, maybe we can
go by after school.

03:58.446 --> 03:59.715
Probably a good idea,

03:59.739 --> 04:01.050
since you weren't
there last night.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.833
Yeah, like I planned
that, Bailey.

04:03.076 --> 04:06.504
Right. M-A-N-G-U-S. He
was admitted last night.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.432
And released this morning.

04:08.456 --> 04:09.350
Joe!

04:09.374 --> 04:12.061
Bagels. I was gonna buy you guys
those cruller things you like,

04:12.085 --> 04:14.313
but my doctor says I got
to cut back on the fat.

04:14.337 --> 04:15.940
- Joe!
- Hiya, sweetie.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.233
They released you already?

04:17.257 --> 04:18.817
Yeah, apparently I'm gonna live.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.444
That is, until I see
the hospital bills,

04:20.468 --> 04:21.769
and then all bets are off.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.614
But what's wrong with you?

04:23.638 --> 04:25.199
You could barely
breathe last night.

04:25.223 --> 04:26.283
You sure you're okay?

04:26.307 --> 04:27.650
What did the doctor say?

04:27.892 --> 04:30.079
It sounds a hell of a
lot worse than it is.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.413
What did she call it?

04:31.437 --> 04:35.616
It's, um... Congestive
heart something.

04:35.858 --> 04:39.964
Anyway, apparently my heart
wasn't working up to speed.

04:39.988 --> 04:42.925
So, the doctor says all I gotta
do is I gotta watch my diet,

04:42.949 --> 04:46.669
and then I gotta take
these little pills.

04:46.744 --> 04:48.973
Anyway, all I know is they
make my blood flow easier,

04:48.997 --> 04:50.923
and they cost $300 a bottle.

04:50.999 --> 04:55.136
Claudia, forget the fiddle.
Medicine is where the money is.

04:55.503 --> 04:57.273
So... You're okay?

04:57.297 --> 04:59.650
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm fine.

04:59.674 --> 05:02.778
No, this scare, it was the best
thing that could have happened,

05:02.802 --> 05:04.530
because I take care
of the problem now,

05:04.554 --> 05:06.147
and I live to be a hundred.

05:08.641 --> 05:09.775
Oh, look at you guys.

05:10.351 --> 05:11.527
All worried.

05:11.686 --> 05:13.988
Relax. You're all in my will.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.699
Think a little cream
cheese'll kill me?

05:22.363 --> 05:23.497
- Whoa!
- Oh!

05:24.115 --> 05:25.009
Hey.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.635
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

05:26.659 --> 05:29.003
Yeah, well, at least now I
know you're not avoiding me.

05:29.078 --> 05:30.212
Me? No!

05:32.832 --> 05:34.518
So, uh... Guess what.

05:34.542 --> 05:37.219
I had this wild dream that I
wanted to tell you about.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.356
You see, I was at your house,

05:39.380 --> 05:40.649
and it was a party or something.

05:40.673 --> 05:42.651
Oh, and listen to this.
This is really bizarre.

05:42.675 --> 05:45.561
See, I told you that I
was in love with you.

05:46.137 --> 05:48.022
And it's funny

05:48.056 --> 05:49.825
because at the time
it felt so real...

05:49.849 --> 05:50.743
Look, Sarah...

05:50.767 --> 05:52.526
No, let me. Um...

05:53.144 --> 05:56.530
Oh, God. I'm sorry that I put
you on the spot like that.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.042
It's just sometimes things

05:58.066 --> 06:00.159
fly out of my mouth
for no reason.

06:00.610 --> 06:01.503
So what I'd like to do

06:01.527 --> 06:04.131
is put the most embarrassing thing
I've ever done in my whole entire life

06:04.155 --> 06:05.289
behind us...

06:06.365 --> 06:08.501
And move forward to potentially
more embarrassing moments.

06:10.745 --> 06:12.004
That sounds fair.

06:13.998 --> 06:16.175
So I heard you dropped
out of the election.

06:16.250 --> 06:17.385
Yeah.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.845
Yeah, what happened
was I realized that

06:20.004 --> 06:21.931
I don't really have the
time for it right now.

06:23.049 --> 06:24.767
I don't have time for
a lot of things.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.978
You know, now that I'm
back on the football team,

06:28.262 --> 06:30.240
there's gonna be scouts
coming to all of the games,

06:30.264 --> 06:31.575
and a scholarship's
probably the only way

06:31.599 --> 06:33.911
I'm gonna get anywhere near
a good college next year.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.152
- Bailey...
- And...

06:38.272 --> 06:39.615
It's okay. I get it.

06:40.525 --> 06:44.078
I see him in the halls, you know,
and for a second I forget.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.674
And I'm about to go, like,

06:47.698 --> 06:50.209
"Hey, isn't that a
new shirt?" or,

06:50.409 --> 06:52.805
"The funniest thing
happened in Soc."

06:52.829 --> 06:55.172
And then he gives
me this look...

06:56.290 --> 06:57.716
And I remember.

07:00.670 --> 07:02.388
Do you think he's gonna
hate me forever?

07:03.172 --> 07:05.724
I mean, do you? 'Cause
I really miss him.

07:06.300 --> 07:09.103
Would you give yourself
a break, please?

07:09.679 --> 07:11.480
You're allowed to break
up with somebody.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.900
Anyway, technically,
Justin broke up with you.

07:15.518 --> 07:17.027
Well, can you blame him?

07:18.104 --> 07:20.406
Okay. Okay.

07:21.065 --> 07:22.876
Look, I was gonna save
this until later,

07:22.900 --> 07:25.494
but I think you could use
some cheering up now.

07:26.362 --> 07:28.956
This is a "Don't be
bummed" present.

07:30.074 --> 07:32.126
Use them in good health,
as my grandma used to say.

07:32.743 --> 07:34.888
Well, I don't think she
ever meant condoms, but...

07:34.912 --> 07:37.141
Nin, I don't need these. Griffin
and I, we're not even...

07:37.165 --> 07:38.966
Well, maybe not yet.

07:39.876 --> 07:42.312
You're dating a guy
who has had sex.

07:42.336 --> 07:43.439
So what?

07:43.463 --> 07:45.598
So the guys who have
had sex have sex.

07:45.756 --> 07:47.401
You think they're
obsessed with it before.

07:47.425 --> 07:49.894
Once they've done it, forget about it.
There's no going back.

07:50.052 --> 07:53.105
Well, that's ridiculous. Besides,
it's never even come up.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.192
I am just telling you, Jule,

07:56.350 --> 07:59.153
with a guy like
Griffin, be afraid.

07:59.270 --> 08:00.946
Be very afraid.

08:03.316 --> 08:06.410
And drive down this street.
Check out that paint job.

08:06.986 --> 08:08.662
My paint job.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.091
Great paint job, Charlie.

08:11.115 --> 08:14.126
It's an $800 paint job. Not bad.

08:15.328 --> 08:18.464
So lunch is on me.
A big splurge.

08:19.248 --> 08:22.051
Let's go to Salinger's.
I wanna check on Joe.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.053
Okay.

08:25.546 --> 08:27.389
You're not worried about him?

08:27.965 --> 08:29.651
Of course I'm worried about him.

08:29.675 --> 08:31.268
He's gotta take better
care of himself.

08:31.427 --> 08:33.102
He's pretty sick, Charlie.

08:33.596 --> 08:35.407
Yeah, he's sick. I
know he's sick.

08:35.431 --> 08:36.774
He's got a heart problem.

08:37.475 --> 08:39.400
But he's gonna be okay.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.623
It's scary, isn't it?
I mean, you love him.

08:42.647 --> 08:45.115
What? What are you
doing, Kirsten?

08:45.441 --> 08:47.326
I'm trying to be realistic.

08:47.985 --> 08:50.172
Everybody's walking around
like Joe just got diagnosed

08:50.196 --> 08:52.299
with a bad case of the
hiccups or something.

08:52.323 --> 08:55.709
He went into the hospital
for observation. One night.

08:56.494 --> 08:57.628
Okay.

08:57.995 --> 09:00.381
But things are gonna have
to change at Salinger's.

09:00.623 --> 09:01.683
What?

09:01.707 --> 09:04.009
Someone's gonna have to
run the place for him.

09:06.128 --> 09:07.680
Then I'll help him find someone.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.569
No. No. Forget it. And
you know what, Kirsten?

09:12.593 --> 09:14.854
You're just making trouble
here, so cut it out.

09:15.596 --> 09:17.815
You didn't see his doctors
running around getting nervous.

09:18.307 --> 09:20.118
I'm telling you, he's just gonna
take it easy for a while.

09:20.142 --> 09:22.695
By Christmas, he'll be the same old Joe.
I'm telling you.

09:27.191 --> 09:29.743
I might like you better
if we slept together.

09:30.486 --> 09:31.620
What?

09:32.154 --> 09:34.466
It's that song. I haven't
heard it in a while.

09:34.490 --> 09:36.792
Oh, yeah, me neither.

09:36.951 --> 09:38.210
Ugh!

09:39.120 --> 09:41.139
Oh, people really care
about this stuff?

09:41.163 --> 09:42.882
I guess.

09:44.208 --> 09:47.219
Did you see this quiz thing?
Look at this.

09:47.336 --> 09:51.024
"Is your sex drive more like a
station wagon or a Porsche?"

09:51.048 --> 09:53.350
Yeah, it's pretty silly.

09:53.467 --> 09:55.603
You know, those pencil
marks aren't mine.

09:55.845 --> 10:00.316
Oh. "If you made love every
time you thought about it,

10:00.600 --> 10:03.903
how many times a
week would that be?"

10:05.938 --> 10:07.615
You got a calculator on you?

10:07.940 --> 10:09.867
I'm kidding. Kidding.

10:10.860 --> 10:11.795
See...

10:11.819 --> 10:15.173
Oh, "What's the most
outrageous place you ever..."

10:15.197 --> 10:16.466
Could you please, um...

10:16.490 --> 10:17.759
Ah, you're right.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.803
It's boring to talk
about it anyway.

10:19.827 --> 10:21.295
Wanna get out of here?

10:21.329 --> 10:22.931
Oh, uh, God. You know what?

10:22.955 --> 10:24.433
I completely forgot.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.426
I have to... I have
to babysit Owen.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.062
You need a ride?

10:29.086 --> 10:31.805
No, thanks. I'm okay.
See you. Bye.

10:35.384 --> 10:36.653
All right! Come on!

10:36.677 --> 10:38.145
Possum D, possum D.

10:38.512 --> 10:39.698
Team!

10:39.722 --> 10:41.283
All right, let's go, boys.
Come on.

10:41.307 --> 10:42.367
Set it up. Set it up!

10:42.391 --> 10:43.577
Right. Fourth and eight to go.

10:43.601 --> 10:46.038
No time-outs left.
Niners are up by 2.

10:46.062 --> 10:48.332
Whole stadium knows that Aikman's
gonna throw it to Irvin.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.042
You, Bailey Salinger,

10:50.066 --> 10:52.336
are the only thing standing between
the Cowboys and the Super Bowl.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.253
Come on!

10:53.277 --> 10:55.037
- Good.
- That's it!

10:56.405 --> 10:58.759
All right! Let's go! Whoo!

10:58.783 --> 11:00.042
All right! Hut!

11:01.619 --> 11:03.305
Come on! Get him!

11:03.329 --> 11:05.307
Go, go, go, go, go! Get him!

11:05.331 --> 11:07.508
- Ooh!
- Yeah! Let's go.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.093
Break!

11:09.502 --> 11:10.636
Ugh!

11:12.880 --> 11:16.350
Come on. Get up so I can
knock you down again.

11:19.303 --> 11:21.563
Hughes, you... You all right?

11:21.931 --> 11:23.784
Good hit, man. Come on.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.234
Andy, what's up?

11:25.309 --> 11:26.694
I can't.

11:27.436 --> 11:28.612
I can't move.

11:29.814 --> 11:31.448
Come on, man. Stop
kidding around.

11:32.191 --> 11:33.325
Andy.

11:33.692 --> 11:34.827
Hey, man.

11:35.027 --> 11:36.171
Guys, clear out of here.

11:36.195 --> 11:38.080
Give me some room. Give me some room.
Come on. Now.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.758
Okay, son. Lie still.

11:39.782 --> 11:41.750
Can't move you until the
ambulance gets here.

11:41.992 --> 11:43.919
Take it easy. All right.

11:44.412 --> 11:45.629
You'll be okay.

12:06.350 --> 12:07.484
Hi.

12:08.227 --> 12:09.361
Claudia, what are you...

12:13.524 --> 12:14.658
Charlie brought me.

12:15.526 --> 12:17.578
It's 7:00. Why didn't
you wake me up?

12:18.154 --> 12:19.747
- Charlie!
- You're awake.

12:20.072 --> 12:22.259
Couldn't get a damn thing out
of any of these night nurses.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.251
Maybe somebody on the morning
shift will be able...

12:25.369 --> 12:26.503
Or you.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.547
Charlie, maybe they'll tell you.

12:31.375 --> 12:32.509
What?

12:32.877 --> 12:33.770
What?

12:33.794 --> 12:37.181
Look, they can't really tell
anything for sure. Not yet.

12:37.465 --> 12:38.599
What?

12:39.800 --> 12:41.018
What can't they tell?

12:45.097 --> 12:46.899
Something bad, right?
Something really bad?

12:48.976 --> 12:50.829
There's swelling around
the spinal cord.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.988
They can't really tell
if there's nerve damage.

12:54.648 --> 12:56.617
He might not be
able to walk again.

12:59.111 --> 13:00.245
They don't know.

13:08.996 --> 13:10.130
Hey.

13:10.372 --> 13:12.341
You put out that fire yesterday?

13:12.708 --> 13:14.468
You kind of took off
from me in a hurry.

13:14.668 --> 13:17.471
No, I just, um, had to get home.

13:19.423 --> 13:20.599
Yeah. Whatever.

13:21.717 --> 13:23.435
I could use some sleep.

13:25.262 --> 13:26.605
Oh, my God.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.317
When did you get that?

13:31.018 --> 13:32.152
Oh, yeah.

13:32.561 --> 13:35.364
The major practically had a
stroke when I got the first one.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.658
He'll probably throw me out
of the house this time.

13:39.777 --> 13:41.338
You hate it.

13:41.362 --> 13:42.496
No.

13:43.531 --> 13:46.166
I don't know. It's mean-looking.

13:47.076 --> 13:49.545
It's a good thing I didn't go
with the skull and bones, then.

13:52.039 --> 13:53.757
You know, uh, you
should get one.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.977
Mmm, I don't know.

13:56.001 --> 13:57.719
Yeah, yeah. Maybe a...

13:58.003 --> 13:59.263
Maybe a rose.

13:59.880 --> 14:02.766
Or one of those
yin-yang symbols.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.400
We, uh...

14:11.517 --> 14:14.862
We really don't know anything
more about Andy's condition.

14:15.229 --> 14:16.864
I talked to his dad today.

14:16.939 --> 14:18.699
Some of you fellas know his dad.

14:18.941 --> 14:19.835
He told me that Andy...

14:19.859 --> 14:22.202
I was looking for you all day.
Where you been? You okay?

14:22.945 --> 14:24.079
Yeah.

14:24.530 --> 14:25.715
I kind of thought
you wouldn't show.

14:25.739 --> 14:28.959
So, anyway, we've decided we're
gonna leave it up to you fellas

14:29.535 --> 14:30.470
whether we play tomorrow...

14:30.494 --> 14:32.004
What are you doing here, Bay?

14:33.330 --> 14:34.756
So who says play?

14:35.332 --> 14:36.800
- Let's play!
- All right!

14:38.544 --> 14:41.180
All right. Then let's
have a good practice.

14:41.297 --> 14:42.431
And tomorrow night,

14:42.882 --> 14:45.559
what do you say we bring that
game ball home for Hughes?

14:48.929 --> 14:50.105
Salinger.

14:53.517 --> 14:54.651
Hey, coach.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.403
You don't have to
be here today, son.

14:58.063 --> 14:59.198
I know.

15:26.634 --> 15:27.851
All right!

15:30.721 --> 15:32.564
What's goin' on with you, man?

15:32.806 --> 15:34.566
Huh? What are you doing?

15:35.559 --> 15:36.578
Shut up, Will.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.622
What, are you trying to
get yourself killed? Huh?

15:38.646 --> 15:40.415
Are we gonna play or what?
Come on.

15:40.439 --> 15:41.657
Huddle up!

15:44.693 --> 15:46.119
This smells like you.

15:47.154 --> 15:50.123
I pass girls in the hallway
now, wearing this,

15:50.616 --> 15:51.833
and, uh...

15:53.035 --> 15:54.586
Sometimes I think it's you.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.014
Yeah?

15:56.038 --> 15:57.172
Yeah.

16:04.296 --> 16:05.639
Lip-lock alert.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.401
Let me ask you something, Claud.

16:08.425 --> 16:10.779
On your home planet, didn't
they teach you about knocking?

16:10.803 --> 16:12.980
I'm going over to Ross's
to play with the baby.

16:13.222 --> 16:14.856
But Kirsten's still here, right?

16:15.432 --> 16:16.326
Right?

16:16.350 --> 16:19.403
No, she's out, and
Bill's got Owen, so...

16:19.561 --> 16:22.030
- see you.
- Claud, wait. Um...

16:22.106 --> 16:24.199
Just so I'm clear on this,

16:24.358 --> 16:25.867
um, no one else is home, right?

16:26.527 --> 16:27.661
Duh!

16:31.865 --> 16:33.000
So...

16:33.575 --> 16:36.503
Maybe we should, you know,
figure out what we're gonna do.

16:37.329 --> 16:38.922
We should go out, right?

16:39.081 --> 16:42.175
Oh, actually, you know,
I'm, uh, kind of beat.

16:42.501 --> 16:45.971
You think, uh... Think we
could just stay in tonight?

17:00.769 --> 17:01.903
Joe.

17:02.146 --> 17:03.530
Oh, hey, Charlie.

17:04.522 --> 17:06.616
Yeah, I'm just catching
a little break.

17:07.358 --> 17:09.295
I guess I better... Oh!

17:09.319 --> 17:10.213
Joe...

17:10.237 --> 17:12.039
No, I'm all right. I'm all right.
I'm fine.

17:13.406 --> 17:14.540
It's, uh...

17:14.867 --> 17:17.595
Mostly I'm just sitting here
worrying whether table two

17:17.618 --> 17:19.713
got the pellegrino
they asked me for.

17:23.459 --> 17:24.843
What's going on, Joe?

17:29.298 --> 17:30.724
I'm sick, Charlie.

17:32.134 --> 17:34.019
I'm not dying, but I'm sick.

17:35.304 --> 17:37.481
It's, uh, congestive
heart failure.

17:39.975 --> 17:42.120
Then what the hell were they doing
letting you out of the hospital?

17:42.144 --> 17:44.196
They didn't let me out. I, uh...

17:44.730 --> 17:46.656
I signed myself out early.

17:47.441 --> 17:50.035
- What? - I don't wanna
deal with it, okay?

17:50.360 --> 17:52.412
It just pisses me off.

17:53.739 --> 17:57.793
Because I think about it,
and I'm still a young man.

17:58.577 --> 18:00.930
I mean, in my mind, you
know, I'm 25 years old,

18:00.954 --> 18:05.342
and I'm staying out all night, and
I'm still drinking, and I'm...

18:05.959 --> 18:07.094
Whatever.

18:08.587 --> 18:09.721
But...

18:10.547 --> 18:12.391
This damn body of mine...

18:16.470 --> 18:18.480
You can't really do
this anymore, can you?

18:19.598 --> 18:21.525
Oh, yeah. I can.

18:26.146 --> 18:27.781
I'm gonna take
over for you, Joe.

18:29.483 --> 18:30.460
No. No, you're not.

18:30.484 --> 18:31.377
Yeah.

18:31.401 --> 18:32.619
- Charlie...
- What?

18:33.070 --> 18:35.507
What are we gonna do? Turn this
place over to a total stranger?

18:35.531 --> 18:36.873
Dad's place?

18:37.491 --> 18:39.636
I can't let you
do this, Charlie.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.628
You got too much you
wanna do with your life.

18:41.870 --> 18:44.506
Yeah, I know. So, I'll...

18:45.040 --> 18:46.633
Quit painting houses.

18:47.042 --> 18:48.593
I think I can live with that.

18:51.004 --> 18:52.806
What are you looking
at me like that for?

18:53.841 --> 18:54.984
Give me a little
support here, huh?

18:55.008 --> 18:57.144
This is kind of a
momentous decision.

18:58.053 --> 18:59.187
Right.

19:02.558 --> 19:03.733
I don't know.

19:04.351 --> 19:05.995
I made so much noise for so long

19:06.019 --> 19:07.946
about how much I
hated this place...

19:10.858 --> 19:13.920
It could be there was just
some stupid little voice in me

19:13.944 --> 19:15.871
I just didn't wanna
hear, you know?

19:16.196 --> 19:19.833
Saying, "Hey, you
could do worse.

19:20.659 --> 19:22.878
You could do way worse
than Salinger's."

19:30.752 --> 19:33.180
You know, Griffin, I
just don't feel ready.

19:37.092 --> 19:38.768
The thing is I've
taken this vow.

19:40.596 --> 19:43.940
It's not gonna happen, buddy,
so just keep it in your pants.

19:44.975 --> 19:46.276
Yeah, right.

19:49.271 --> 19:50.739
Griffin, we need to talk.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.578
Griffin, I'm, uh...

19:57.070 --> 19:59.456
- I'm...
- You got an extra pillow?

20:19.259 --> 20:21.019
Oh. Thanks.

20:21.762 --> 20:23.355
Hey, turn the lights off.

20:25.515 --> 20:27.359
Um, Griffin, we need to talk.

20:28.310 --> 20:29.736
Can we do it in the morning?

20:30.729 --> 20:31.623
Do what?

20:31.647 --> 20:32.781
Talk.

20:33.190 --> 20:34.366
I'm really wiped.

20:35.651 --> 20:36.785
Sure.

20:37.736 --> 20:38.870
Sure.

20:39.029 --> 20:40.163
So, the light?

20:40.614 --> 20:41.748
Oh.

21:00.509 --> 21:01.726
Hey.

21:01.969 --> 21:03.603
Will said you'd be here.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.857
God. Who did that to you?

21:14.815 --> 21:17.033
I keep seeing it over and
over again, you know?

21:19.778 --> 21:20.912
I hit him...

21:22.656 --> 21:25.375
And he goes down, and
he doesn't get up.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.419
Bailey...

21:28.537 --> 21:29.671
You didn't mean to.

21:32.374 --> 21:34.718
You know, what happened with
Andy, you didn't mean to.

21:35.502 --> 21:37.137
What difference does that make?

21:42.509 --> 21:43.643
Does it hurt?

21:47.514 --> 21:48.690
Not enough.

22:38.023 --> 22:39.157
Hello?

22:41.735 --> 22:44.162
Brannan and Delancy
between 5 and 8.

22:45.864 --> 22:48.208
Best Colombian. Ask for Xerxes.
Got it.

22:49.701 --> 22:51.461
What's wrong with our
regular coffee guy?

22:53.371 --> 22:55.298
It's Joe. Again.

22:57.584 --> 22:58.760
Yeah?

22:59.878 --> 23:01.012
No.

23:01.505 --> 23:02.639
Okay.

23:02.798 --> 23:03.775
Okay, okay.

23:03.799 --> 23:04.933
All right!

23:05.467 --> 23:07.769
No, I don't have a pen, Joe.
I'm in the shower.

23:10.013 --> 23:11.991
Joe, his wife is
having a sonogram.

23:12.015 --> 23:13.608
- Morning.
- Morning.

23:14.643 --> 23:16.111
Well, Tony will be there.

23:16.853 --> 23:18.446
He made the dough last night.

23:19.815 --> 23:21.574
It's dough, Joe.

23:23.026 --> 23:23.920
Hey.

23:23.944 --> 23:25.078
Hey!

23:28.156 --> 23:29.290
Jule?

23:29.616 --> 23:30.802
Get out here now!

23:30.826 --> 23:32.377
What? What's going on?

23:32.702 --> 23:33.837
First of all...

23:33.954 --> 23:35.723
First of all, you
are 16 years old.

23:35.747 --> 23:38.226
Sixteen! That is not old
enough to be having sex.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.384
What?

23:39.543 --> 23:41.813
I just saw that
guy, that Griffin.

23:41.837 --> 23:42.971
Oh.

23:43.839 --> 23:45.399
Oh! Charlie, relax.

23:45.423 --> 23:47.934
I mean, God, all we did
was sleep together.

23:48.260 --> 23:51.072
I mean, we slept... In
the same bed together,

23:51.096 --> 23:52.657
- but we didn't
actually do anything.

23:52.681 --> 23:54.899
- If that's Sarah, I'm not here.
- If that's Joe, I'm not here.

23:55.934 --> 23:57.995
Come on, Jule, I know
about guys like Griffin.

23:58.019 --> 24:00.373
They do not crawl into a
girl's bed and just sleep!

24:00.397 --> 24:01.499
Charlie, you don't understand.

24:01.523 --> 24:03.709
It's Sarah. You're supposed
to go to the hospital.

24:03.733 --> 24:05.002
I don't wanna hear it, okay?

24:05.026 --> 24:06.411
I said I'm not here.

24:07.487 --> 24:08.464
Yes, you are.

24:08.488 --> 24:09.757
I don't wanna hear it, Jule.

24:09.781 --> 24:10.967
You're not having
sex in this house,

24:10.991 --> 24:12.667
and you're not
having sex, period!

24:17.706 --> 24:18.923
Exactly.

24:36.474 --> 24:37.692
Mrs...

24:38.852 --> 24:41.029
Mrs. Hughes?

24:42.397 --> 24:44.699
I didn't want him to see me cry.

24:50.780 --> 24:51.915
Here.

24:54.868 --> 24:56.002
Thank you.

24:59.956 --> 25:01.216
Is he bad?

25:02.000 --> 25:03.134
No.

25:03.668 --> 25:06.513
The doctor said
he's gonna be okay.

25:08.965 --> 25:10.600
He's gonna be okay.

25:17.641 --> 25:19.400
Hey! It's the human tank!

25:21.102 --> 25:22.654
Oh, what happened to you?

25:23.813 --> 25:26.292
Uh, your mom... Your mom
told me that, uh...

25:26.316 --> 25:28.034
Yep. Just bruised, not broken.

25:29.945 --> 25:31.079
I'm glad.

25:32.030 --> 25:33.966
I mean... I mean, that's great.

25:33.990 --> 25:36.292
Yeah, bad news is I'm
through for the season.

25:36.701 --> 25:39.170
But I should be getting sympathy
A's all around, don't you think?

25:40.205 --> 25:41.589
Probably, yeah.

25:43.959 --> 25:45.134
Look,

25:46.211 --> 25:48.356
you know that I didn't mean
to do this to you, right?

25:48.380 --> 25:49.806
I mean, you know that.

25:50.215 --> 25:52.151
Because I've been making
myself crazy, thinking...

25:52.175 --> 25:54.435
Hey, hey. It's football.

25:54.511 --> 25:56.030
I mean, these things happen.

25:56.054 --> 25:58.982
Any two guys on the team could be
having this conversation right now.

25:59.474 --> 26:00.576
Oh, except for Bynder.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.986
I mean, he hasn't left the
bench yet this season.

26:05.021 --> 26:06.290
Well, he's playing now.

26:06.314 --> 26:07.782
That's my replacement?

26:08.316 --> 26:10.660
Oh, man, you guys are screwed!

26:13.738 --> 26:16.457
You know, you could crack a smile,
Salinger, man, it wouldn't kill you.

26:17.951 --> 26:19.085
Right.

26:19.786 --> 26:20.763
Right. You got it.

26:20.787 --> 26:22.130
I'm a lucky guy.

26:22.330 --> 26:25.174
The doc said if it had been like
an eighth of an inch higher,

26:25.583 --> 26:28.052
oh, man, I wouldn't be laughing
about anything anymore.

26:30.130 --> 26:31.264
No kidding.

26:31.631 --> 26:33.391
Bynder! Man!

26:33.633 --> 26:34.527
What about Pomerantz, man?

26:34.551 --> 26:36.352
Why don't you tell the
coach to play him.

26:41.641 --> 26:44.036
You sure? Maybe just a glass
of water or something?

26:44.060 --> 26:45.820
No, I'm fine,
sweetheart, thank you.

26:45.895 --> 26:47.030
Hey, Joe.

26:47.439 --> 26:48.332
Hey.

26:48.356 --> 26:51.242
I was just putting Owen to bed before
I went back to the restaurant.

26:52.360 --> 26:53.337
What's up?

26:53.361 --> 26:56.039
Well, it's no big deal.
It's just that, uh...

26:56.489 --> 26:58.791
I was counting up the
lunch receipts...

26:58.867 --> 27:00.970
Why? I... I did that already.

27:00.994 --> 27:03.055
No, I know, I know, I
just thought maybe...

27:03.079 --> 27:05.266
What, that I couldn't do it?
Is that what you thought?

27:05.290 --> 27:06.767
What? No, Charlie.

27:06.791 --> 27:10.178
It's just... It never
hurts to double-check.

27:10.920 --> 27:13.473
And, uh, look.

27:13.757 --> 27:15.808
You were off, right there.

27:16.092 --> 27:17.226
See?

27:22.265 --> 27:24.859
Um, Claud, could you go
check on Owen for me?

27:26.269 --> 27:27.403
Please?

27:31.149 --> 27:35.880
Uh, help me out here, Joe. You just
climbed 72 stairs in your condition

27:35.904 --> 27:38.591
to tell me that my math is
off by $14 and some change?

27:38.615 --> 27:40.718
Hey, every penny counts.

27:40.742 --> 27:42.845
You know, Charlie, you
gotta stay on top of it.

27:42.869 --> 27:45.431
I am on top of it, Joe. I
know what I'm doing here.

27:45.455 --> 27:48.017
I can't do it with you
riding my ass all day!

27:48.041 --> 27:53.554
Hey, you know, a restaurant doesn't
run like clockwork overnight, okay?

27:53.922 --> 27:56.317
Charlie, I'm just trying to
show you the ins and the outs.

27:56.341 --> 27:57.485
I'm trying to help you out here.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.111
Are you, Joe, or are you
just trying to prove

27:59.135 --> 28:01.938
that I can't do it, that
no one can, not like you?

28:05.725 --> 28:07.068
That's it, isn't it?

28:08.770 --> 28:09.914
You need to believe
that, don't you?

28:09.938 --> 28:11.406
'Cause that place is your life.

28:19.280 --> 28:20.415
Joe.

28:21.574 --> 28:22.551
Hey...

28:22.575 --> 28:23.710
Joe.

28:47.517 --> 28:49.694
All right, defense,
we gotta hold them.

28:50.353 --> 28:54.073
Linebackers, cover the underneath!
Let's go get 'em!

28:57.318 --> 28:58.995
Salinger, what are
you, on vacation?

28:59.863 --> 29:02.707
Come on. I'm talking to you.

29:06.327 --> 29:08.004
D, get in there.

29:09.205 --> 29:10.339
Come on, Bay.

29:10.665 --> 29:12.717
What's the problem, man?
Everything's cool.

29:12.792 --> 29:14.927
Hughes is gonna be okay.
Come on.

29:15.128 --> 29:16.262
I can't.

29:19.883 --> 29:22.060
McCorkle, I gotta send
someone in for you too?

29:22.343 --> 29:24.020
No. No, coach.

29:30.852 --> 29:32.236
Get out of here.

29:55.960 --> 29:57.637
What exactly are we looking for?

29:58.296 --> 30:00.775
Headlight. Mine's
not the original.

30:00.799 --> 30:03.643
Well, wouldn't it be easier
to find one during the day?

30:03.843 --> 30:05.436
Then I'd have to pay for it.

30:05.887 --> 30:09.357
Besides, I kind of like it
out here when it's dark.

30:13.311 --> 30:15.988
It's like there's, uh, ghosts.

30:16.189 --> 30:18.616
All these old cars
and parts and stuff.

30:20.318 --> 30:22.537
It makes me wonder
where they've been...

30:23.988 --> 30:25.373
Who drove them...

30:26.658 --> 30:28.126
How come they junked 'em?

30:28.993 --> 30:30.128
Griffin.

30:31.037 --> 30:32.171
Wow, that's it!

30:33.957 --> 30:35.309
This is what you
were looking for?

30:35.333 --> 30:37.436
Yeah! Yeah, wow.

30:37.460 --> 30:39.512
Well, don't I get
some kind of reward?

30:42.882 --> 30:44.016
Thanks.

30:54.936 --> 30:56.654
Look, I have to ask
you something.

30:58.064 --> 31:01.242
And I know that maybe this
is kind of pushy and, um...

31:02.026 --> 31:04.871
I'm not saying that I want
to, because I... I don't.

31:05.947 --> 31:08.583
It just seems like you don't
want to either, and I just...

31:08.950 --> 31:10.302
I don't know, I figured
that you would,

31:10.326 --> 31:12.847
because, I mean,
obviously you have.

31:12.871 --> 31:15.923
Um... Can we try
this in English?

31:18.126 --> 31:19.719
Don't you wanna sleep with me?

31:21.754 --> 31:24.932
I mean, um, sleep-with-me
sleep with me?

31:28.011 --> 31:29.896
Uh, what?

31:31.598 --> 31:34.942
Well, uh, don't you want me?

31:37.562 --> 31:38.696
I, uh...

31:43.276 --> 31:44.493
I...

32:02.170 --> 32:03.596
Busy day today, huh?

32:07.091 --> 32:08.226
Uh-huh.

32:08.384 --> 32:10.946
I mean, a lot happened,
like Andy being okay.

32:10.970 --> 32:13.356
That's good news, huh? I
mean, that's a relief.

32:14.015 --> 32:15.242
And then the game
tonight for you guys.

32:15.266 --> 32:17.318
I mean, that's...
That's a big deal.

32:17.435 --> 32:19.413
If you're really...
You're really busy...

32:19.437 --> 32:21.614
Could you stop? Please?

32:25.860 --> 32:26.994
Okay.

32:28.571 --> 32:30.998
So... So I can really understand

32:31.115 --> 32:33.417
why you didn't have time
to talk to me today.

32:35.078 --> 32:38.256
Why you decided to say you weren't
home when I called this morning.

32:40.041 --> 32:42.394
And why you didn't say anything
about Andy being better

32:42.418 --> 32:44.303
even though you
knew I was worried.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.347
I mean, you knew.

32:49.258 --> 32:50.393
I'm sorry.

32:51.302 --> 32:52.979
Why are you such a jerk?

32:54.514 --> 32:57.149
Why did you have to turn
out to be such a jerk?

32:59.769 --> 33:02.113
I've never gone that
far with anybody else.

33:02.188 --> 33:03.322
Never.

33:05.066 --> 33:07.285
I kept thinking about
you all night.

33:07.735 --> 33:10.506
I couldn't stop
thinking about you.

33:10.530 --> 33:11.423
Sarah...

33:11.447 --> 33:13.582
And I feel really stupid now.

33:17.078 --> 33:18.472
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

33:18.496 --> 33:19.714
I don't.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.633
I don't mean to hurt anyone.

33:24.961 --> 33:26.929
Is that really the
best you can do?

33:28.923 --> 33:30.182
It's pretty lame.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.978
I didn't play in
the game tonight.

33:36.097 --> 33:38.691
Coach tried to put me in, but...

33:40.309 --> 33:42.153
I just sat there on the bench.

33:42.395 --> 33:43.529
I just...

33:45.273 --> 33:46.490
I just couldn't.

33:47.150 --> 33:48.409
I couldn't.

33:51.195 --> 33:52.798
What do you do, Bailey?

33:52.822 --> 33:55.207
Do you just bag out
on everything?

33:58.911 --> 34:00.254
You don't understand.

34:03.833 --> 34:05.843
I was at the hospital
the night it happened.

34:07.128 --> 34:08.262
And...

34:09.922 --> 34:11.431
And I saw his mom.

34:14.635 --> 34:16.437
And I saw the look on her face.

34:17.513 --> 34:18.813
And I thought,

34:19.931 --> 34:21.734
"I took something from you.

34:24.896 --> 34:27.156
And I know exactly how
you feel, because...

34:29.942 --> 34:31.327
Because somebody once

34:31.402 --> 34:33.788
took something that
important away from me.

34:37.074 --> 34:38.208
And...

34:40.203 --> 34:43.130
I can't make it up to you, and
I can't make it go away."

34:46.167 --> 34:47.676
Nothing happened, Bailey.

34:49.003 --> 34:50.221
This close.

34:51.755 --> 34:54.141
I came this close, and...

34:55.134 --> 34:56.560
And I'm scared.

35:00.389 --> 35:01.816
Because I can...

35:03.267 --> 35:05.152
Do terrible things.

35:08.606 --> 35:10.658
I can do terrible
things to people.

35:13.861 --> 35:15.037
Yeah.

35:15.863 --> 35:17.498
Well, I could have
told you that.

35:29.585 --> 35:30.845
Anybody home?

35:32.380 --> 35:33.681
Yeah. What?

35:34.006 --> 35:35.391
It's almost noon.

35:38.302 --> 35:41.021
Just wanted to know if you were
planning on getting up any time today.

35:42.181 --> 35:43.315
Nope.

35:44.767 --> 35:46.735
I heard you didn't play
in the game last night.

35:47.812 --> 35:48.988
Yeah.

35:49.230 --> 35:51.490
So are you gonna give me
a hard time about that?

35:53.109 --> 35:54.368
No, Bay, I'm not.

36:02.910 --> 36:03.971
You haven't been around much,

36:03.995 --> 36:06.005
so I don't know if
you know, but, uh...

36:07.790 --> 36:09.258
I'm taking over
the restaurant...

36:10.126 --> 36:11.260
From Joe.

36:11.419 --> 36:12.396
You are?

36:12.420 --> 36:13.554
Yeah.

36:16.632 --> 36:18.225
I didn't think you wanted that.

36:18.301 --> 36:19.768
Yeah, well, I don't know.

36:20.469 --> 36:22.188
Maybe it's the right thing.

36:22.638 --> 36:24.064
Maybe it'll work out great.

36:25.683 --> 36:27.902
I mean, if I never take
a chance, you know?

36:30.938 --> 36:34.742
So, anyway, I'll turn off the phone
ringer so it doesn't bother you.

36:48.789 --> 36:50.382
Don't worry. I'm not staying.

36:51.250 --> 36:52.593
It's okay, Joe.

36:57.840 --> 37:00.476
Listen, last night, what I said.

37:01.260 --> 37:02.561
I didn't mean that.

37:03.471 --> 37:04.939
Hey, forget it.

37:05.598 --> 37:07.441
It's nothing I
already didn't know.

37:08.017 --> 37:10.778
Okay. I guess I got everything.

37:11.938 --> 37:15.449
Hey, it's... Not like
you're never coming back.

37:15.858 --> 37:18.494
If Wednesday night's good for
you, come by for dinner.

37:18.945 --> 37:20.871
Or any night, really.
You know that.

37:21.280 --> 37:24.041
Well, it's still my restaurant.
I'll come back any time I want.

37:27.745 --> 37:30.515
Hey, listen, um, table
14, it's still wobbling,

37:30.539 --> 37:32.601
so you take a look at it.
You're good with furniture.

37:32.625 --> 37:35.479
And the new menus, they're
coming in on Friday,

37:35.503 --> 37:37.137
so if they don't...

37:38.714 --> 37:39.974
Ah, you know.

37:59.568 --> 38:02.621
Can't you come up and ring the
doorbell like everybody else?

38:07.368 --> 38:08.502
What are you...?

38:08.577 --> 38:10.087
Here's what I'm thinking.

38:10.830 --> 38:14.216
Now, it's like this really
big obligation, you know,

38:14.917 --> 38:16.343
being a girl's first.

38:17.712 --> 38:18.846
What?

38:18.963 --> 38:20.472
Well, you're a virgin, right?

38:21.674 --> 38:23.694
Why are you saying that?
Why would you assume...

38:23.718 --> 38:25.279
Because you are,
right, a virgin?

38:25.303 --> 38:26.571
Would you stop saying that word?

38:26.595 --> 38:29.023
- Well, you are, aren't you?
- Yes, I am, okay?

38:29.181 --> 38:31.775
Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's cool.

38:32.518 --> 38:33.652
But... uh...

38:35.396 --> 38:37.906
I mean, look, if we did it,

38:38.524 --> 38:39.658
then...

38:42.862 --> 38:44.913
Well, it would be
great and all but...

38:45.239 --> 38:48.334
I know you, and it
would be a big deal...

38:50.369 --> 38:52.046
And I'm not into big deals.

38:56.834 --> 38:58.052
You know, so...

39:01.756 --> 39:03.098
I'm thinking that we shouldn't.

39:12.433 --> 39:13.776
You wanna...

39:13.934 --> 39:15.861
You wanna go for a
ride or something?

39:22.234 --> 39:23.369
Hey, you.

39:24.528 --> 39:25.663
Hey.

39:26.238 --> 39:29.166
I'm almost done. I'm just
double-checking these receipts.

39:30.159 --> 39:32.044
Actually, I'm triple-checking.

39:33.996 --> 39:36.256
I mean, I've closed
up before, you know,

39:36.582 --> 39:38.217
but now it feels kind of...

39:39.418 --> 39:40.552
Different.

39:42.046 --> 39:44.139
My guess is you know
what you're doing.

39:44.548 --> 39:47.685
You know this place the way Joe
did, the way your father did.

39:48.636 --> 39:50.479
No, it was different with Dad.

39:52.139 --> 39:53.325
He'd close up at 11:00,

39:53.349 --> 39:56.151
and then he'd make up this
huge pot of spaghetti

39:56.811 --> 39:59.238
and sit around with Joe
and the other guys and...

40:01.565 --> 40:02.834
They'd tell stories, you know,

40:02.858 --> 40:05.077
about the business,
about their kids.

40:07.238 --> 40:09.966
At his funeral, guys he hadn't
worked with for 15 years

40:09.990 --> 40:12.334
told stories like he was
still their best friend.

40:14.870 --> 40:16.213
Because this place...

40:18.165 --> 40:19.717
Wasn't work for him.

40:21.710 --> 40:22.970
It was his life.

40:25.339 --> 40:26.765
He made it his life.

40:28.634 --> 40:30.477
Is that what you're
afraid of, Charlie?

40:32.721 --> 40:34.982
Are you afraid of turning
into your father?

40:37.309 --> 40:38.444
No.

40:40.646 --> 40:43.449
No. I'm just afraid of not
being as good as he was.

41:03.169 --> 41:04.511
What are you doing here?

41:07.882 --> 41:09.808
The doorman said it
was okay if I waited.

41:10.801 --> 41:12.144
What do you want, Bailey?

41:14.013 --> 41:15.397
I don't know. I was...

41:15.848 --> 41:17.065
I was walking around.

41:19.602 --> 41:21.320
Must have called you,
like, five times today.

41:23.355 --> 41:24.490
You did?

41:24.899 --> 41:26.126
Really? 'Cause...

41:26.150 --> 41:27.534
Only I never picked
up the phone.

41:29.862 --> 41:33.499
See, I... I kept having these
conversations with you in my head.

41:35.826 --> 41:37.377
You know how they started?

41:39.205 --> 41:40.798
This is funny. Wait
till you hear this.

41:43.083 --> 41:45.219
"I'm sorry for being
mad at you, Bailey."

41:48.339 --> 41:49.848
Pretty incredible, huh?

41:51.342 --> 41:52.810
I mean, isn't that incredible?

41:54.386 --> 41:56.647
I was apologizing to you.

41:58.057 --> 42:00.651
Like you're entitled to
feel bad, and I'm not.

42:02.144 --> 42:04.112
And like it's okay for you to...

42:04.980 --> 42:06.698
Well, for you to kiss me...

42:08.317 --> 42:10.035
And touch me, because,
I don't know...

42:10.110 --> 42:11.954
Because you needed some
kind of distraction.

42:13.322 --> 42:17.167
And that it's my fault for wanting
that to mean more to you.

42:20.412 --> 42:22.631
How pathetic does
that make me look?

42:27.044 --> 42:28.262
But you know what?

42:28.879 --> 42:31.056
It's not my fault, Bailey.
It's yours.

42:32.633 --> 42:34.309
And I'm not gonna apologize.

42:34.927 --> 42:36.363
And if you're here
to say you're sorry

42:36.387 --> 42:38.438
and hope that I'm going to
make it better for you...

42:39.223 --> 42:40.440
Well, I'm not.

42:42.726 --> 42:44.027
Because I can't.

42:44.770 --> 42:46.154
Because it's too late.

42:52.111 --> 42:53.328
It's just...

42:54.280 --> 42:55.622
It's just too late.

43:03.664 --> 43:04.923
And I think...

43:08.794 --> 43:10.095
I really think...

43:25.728 --> 43:27.237
It's gonna be okay.

43:32.693 --> 43:34.494
Everything's gonna be okay.
