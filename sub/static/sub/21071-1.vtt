- Hi.
- You're late.

01:40.976 --> 01:42.685
You said seven.

01:42.686 --> 01:45.313
You'll have to feed the boys
at the cinema.

01:45.314 --> 01:46.957
What cinema?
What are you talking about?

01:46.958 --> 01:48.374
You promised to take them
to a film.

01:49.776 --> 01:52.361
Yeah, but what about this?

01:52.362 --> 01:54.585
I'll buy them a pizza, they
watch a movie on the telly,

01:54.586 --> 01:55.781
they get to bed early.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.246
I've got a ton of work to do.

01:57.247 --> 01:58.835
They've been ready to go
for an hour.

01:58.836 --> 02:00.620
Fine.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.464
And try to be happy around them.

02:02.465 --> 02:04.999
- Smile more!
- I smile!

02:06.126 --> 02:08.970
Wait, wait, wait.
What am I... What am I seeing?

02:08.971 --> 02:11.505
Oh, just some doggy flick.

02:11.506 --> 02:13.507
Oh, Christ. Kill me now.

02:13.508 --> 02:15.556
I'm not the one
that promised him a puppy.

02:15.557 --> 02:17.303
No, I didn't.
It was a misunderstanding.

02:17.304 --> 02:18.763
He's lonely.

02:18.764 --> 02:21.557
New city, new school,
no friends.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.777
He cries every day.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.400
<i>Jesus.</i>

02:27.481 --> 02:28.903
Isn't he a bit old to cry?

02:28.904 --> 02:31.233
Why not get him a dog?

02:31.234 --> 02:33.653
M...

02:33.654 --> 02:36.447
Because they... smell, you know?

02:36.448 --> 02:38.199
And... and they lick things.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.246
Dead things in alleys
and... and...

02:40.247 --> 02:42.495
and then their own bum,
and then your face.

02:42.496 --> 02:43.918
- Gross!
- Right.

02:45.582 --> 02:48.334
And they crap everywhere.
They get fleas.

02:48.335 --> 02:49.882
They die.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.261
It's a bad idea, trust me.

02:56.051 --> 02:57.894
- You promised.
- No, I didn't promise.

02:57.895 --> 02:59.470
It was...

02:59.471 --> 03:02.099
Can we not talk about it,
please? Alright?

03:03.642 --> 03:05.935
- What's that'?
- Hmm?

03:05.936 --> 03:08.729
I'm just happy to be out
with my boys.

03:08.730 --> 03:09.939
It's a smile.

03:09.940 --> 03:12.034
You're scaring me.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.119
Right.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.538
Can you tell him to be quiet?

03:23.537 --> 03:24.959
Do you mind?

04:57.297 --> 04:59.140
Alright.
PJs and brush your teeth.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.928
On, Nicholas!

05:05.305 --> 05:07.182
Oh, crikey!

05:10.519 --> 05:12.394
Alright, time for sleep.

05:12.395 --> 05:13.771
Did you like the movie?

05:13.772 --> 05:15.439
It was alright.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.149
You cried.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.526
No, <i>I</i> didn't.

05:18.527 --> 05:19.819
I saw you.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.993
It was hay fever.
Come on, get your head down.

05:21.994 --> 05:23.656
Dad, I saw you crying.

05:23.657 --> 05:26.617
Son, I'm too old to cry.

05:26.618 --> 05:28.160
Now, come on.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.995
But wouldn't it be great?

05:29.996 --> 05:31.497
What?

05:31.498 --> 05:33.374
To have a dog.

05:33.375 --> 05:35.218
A dog like Red.

05:36.294 --> 05:37.671
Lights out.

06:01.820 --> 06:03.914
- Blue.
- What?

06:05.866 --> 06:08.492
His name was Blue, the dog.
Not Red.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.211
You mean the movie actor dog?

06:10.212 --> 06:11.787
His name was Koko.

06:11.788 --> 06:14.498
No, I mean the real dog.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.667
The one the movie was based on.

06:16.668 --> 06:17.840
How do you know?

06:20.213 --> 06:21.806
<i>'Cause he was mine.</i>

06:24.259 --> 06:25.886
I called him Blue.

06:28.305 --> 06:30.683
And he was the first real mate
I ever had.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.654
When I was about your age,

06:41.655 --> 06:44.495
I was living in Sydney
with my mum, your nanna.

06:45.947 --> 06:49.491
And my dad, your grandfather,

06:49.492 --> 06:51.415
had just passed away.

06:54.998 --> 06:56.749
<i>We were both very sad,</i>

06:56.750 --> 06:59.460
<i>but your nanna was...</i>

06:59.461 --> 07:01.964
<i>well, she was very, very sad.</i>

07:06.801 --> 07:09.805
<i>So it was decided she should go
to a special place</i>

07:09.806 --> 07:11.397
<i>to try and relax for a while.</i>

07:13.642 --> 07:15.644
<i>Like</i> a <i>holiday?</i>

07:16.853 --> 07:18.480
Yeah. Sort of.

07:19.606 --> 07:23.943
And I was sent to stay with
my grandpa, your great-grandpa.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.779
He owned a station,
Warndurala Station,

07:26.780 --> 07:28.451
way out west in the Pilbara.

07:28.452 --> 07:30.917
Just south of Dampier,
where the movie took place.

07:32.619 --> 07:36.340
It was so far away, I had to
take three planes to get there.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.355
Watch the snakes!

08:14.452 --> 08:17.422
<i>It was mind-blowing
to be in such</i> a <i>new place.</i>

08:18.957 --> 08:20.833
<i>It was like Mars.</i>

08:20.834 --> 08:25.212
<i>Red. Huge. Fantastic!</i>

08:25.213 --> 08:29.138
This is totally stupid!

08:31.011 --> 08:32.808
<i>I know it's hard to imagine,</i>

08:32.809 --> 08:36.479
<i>but back then, as a boy,
I was different.</i>

08:37.892 --> 08:40.816
<i>I wasn't what you'd cal!
The outdoors type.</i>

08:42.188 --> 08:44.188
<i>And truth be told...</i>

08:47.027 --> 08:48.360
<i>I was scared.</i>

08:55.994 --> 08:57.416
<i>(mum.</i>

09:04.461 --> 09:07.385
Argh!

09:20.477 --> 09:22.946
<i>And then there was Grandpa.</i>

09:24.397 --> 09:25.898
Why are you riling up my horse?

09:25.899 --> 09:28.152
H-he was trying to kill me!

09:31.529 --> 09:32.863
What's wrong with it, Grandpa?

09:32.864 --> 09:34.111
Tallulah was hit by lightning.

09:36.034 --> 09:38.080
She hasn't been the same since.

09:38.081 --> 09:41.173
She's blind in one eye and now
she thinks she's a bull.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.676
In future, you don't go
in that paddock, understand?

09:45.677 --> 09:48.672
OK. Yes, sir.

09:51.174 --> 09:52.471
Come on.

09:55.053 --> 09:57.272
Does lightning hit
a lot of things?

09:57.273 --> 09:58.606
No.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.642
But it's crazy dangerous
when it does, right?

10:01.643 --> 10:02.810
Yes.

10:02.811 --> 10:04.313
How do you not get hit
by lightning?

10:04.314 --> 10:06.313
- You be careful.
- How do you be careful?

10:06.314 --> 10:07.907
Can you tell by the clouds
or something?

10:07.908 --> 10:09.024
Yes.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.068
So you just stay inside
when you see those clouds?

10:11.069 --> 10:12.102
No.

10:12.103 --> 10:13.951
- Are there any crocodiles'?
- Not many.

10:13.952 --> 10:16.281
- They can eat you?
- Yes.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.580
And the worst snake
is a death adder?

10:18.581 --> 10:19.993
Yes.

10:19.994 --> 10:21.745
What happens if you get bitten?

10:21.746 --> 10:22.830
You die.

10:22.831 --> 10:24.458
But not from the spinifex snake?

10:24.459 --> 10:25.791
Nope.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.920
Which is different
from the king brown?

10:27.921 --> 10:29.711
Yes.

10:29.712 --> 10:31.885
And you can die
from a red-back spider?

10:31.886 --> 10:33.382
Yes.

10:33.383 --> 10:35.656
It's like everything out here
can kill you or something.

10:35.657 --> 10:38.518
I don't remember
you talking so much before.

10:38.519 --> 10:41.107
Well, last time you saw me,
Grandpa, I was two.

10:41.108 --> 10:42.724
I wasn't talking yet.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.398
Try and remember that.

10:46.938 --> 10:48.406
Grandpa?

10:49.399 --> 10:50.901
Thank you.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.571
Who else was gonna take you?

11:04.706 --> 11:07.585
<i>So, Dad, were you</i>
a <i>cowboy? A jackaroo?</i>

11:07.586 --> 11:10.043
- A real jackaroo'?
- No.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.503
Oh.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.463
Well, not at first.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.216
So, what did you do?

11:16.718 --> 11:17.844
I swept.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.488
<i>I also watered
Grandpa's orange tree.</i>

11:34.611 --> 11:37.785
<i>Which he loved
more than life itself.</i>

11:39.741 --> 11:41.366
<i>And there was homework.</i>

11:41.367 --> 11:44.371
<i>Correspondence sets
I was supposed to complete.</i>

11:44.372 --> 11:48.000
Peter paid no attention
t0 his grandfather's words.

11:48.001 --> 11:50.047
Boys like him
are not afraid of wolves...

11:50.048 --> 11:55.255
<i>But mainly, I listened
to Grandpa's records.</i>

11:59.052 --> 12:02.431
Peter paid no attention
t0 his grandfather's words.

12:02.432 --> 12:04.853
Boys like him
are not afraid of wolves.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.311
<i>Jimmy Umbrella was our cook.</i>

12:09.312 --> 12:13.398
<i>He hated the sun
and always carried an umbrella.</i>

12:13.399 --> 12:15.150
<i>He cooked for everyone.</i>

12:15.151 --> 12:16.446
Righto, boys, here we go.

12:16.447 --> 12:18.572
<i>The stockmen ate
out by the cookhouse.</i>

12:18.573 --> 12:21.073
<i>There was the helicopter pilot,
Bill Stemple,</i>

12:21.074 --> 12:24.618
<i>and brothers
Little John and Big John.</i>

12:30.291 --> 12:33.465
<i>The biackfeiias ate at their
camp, called Gujarala.</i>

12:36.631 --> 12:38.677
<i>There was Durack and his family,</i>

12:38.678 --> 12:40.222
<i>Mrs Abby and the girls...</i>

12:41.719 --> 12:43.637
Thank you, my darling.

12:43.638 --> 12:47.688
<i>And then Taylor Pete, who was
only a few years older than me</i>

12:47.689 --> 12:49.601
<i>but never copped to it.</i>

12:49.602 --> 12:51.821
<i>He was a rootin', tootin'
stockman.</i>

12:56.109 --> 12:57.656
Comb your hair.

13:03.658 --> 13:06.576
<i>Jimmy Umbrella cooked
three meals</i> a <i>day</i> -

13:06.577 --> 13:08.287
<i>bully beef for breakfast,</i>

13:08.288 --> 13:10.289
<i>cold beef for lunch</i>

13:10.290 --> 13:12.258
<i>and hot beef for dinner.</i>

13:15.253 --> 13:16.545
What's the matter?

13:16.546 --> 13:18.755
Nothing, sir.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.674
You're not talking.

13:20.675 --> 13:22.346
You don't like me talking.

13:22.347 --> 13:23.719
Never stopped you before.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.267
What is it?

13:26.306 --> 13:27.432
It's my birthday.

13:30.226 --> 13:31.569
What do you want for a present?

13:33.229 --> 13:34.822
A salad would be nice.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.068
What else?

13:40.069 --> 13:41.491
I was thinking
my mum would call.

13:41.492 --> 13:42.830
She didn't.

13:44.073 --> 13:45.493
Could I try to call her?

13:45.494 --> 13:47.289
We're not going to talk
about your mother.

13:54.375 --> 13:55.922
Come on.

14:09.432 --> 14:10.932
Happy birthday.

14:10.933 --> 14:13.560
Oh! I thought it was
gonna be a horse!

14:13.561 --> 14:16.438
A horse?
How old do you think I am?

14:16.439 --> 14:18.940
This was 1969.

14:18.941 --> 14:22.486
Horses were out. Motorbikes
and helicopters were in.

14:22.487 --> 14:23.989
Did you know how to ride
a motorbike?

14:23.990 --> 14:25.661
Of course I knew how to ride it.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.492
Oh, nooooooo!

14:29.577 --> 14:31.370
Eventually.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.840
Aaarghh!

14:37.752 --> 14:39.544
<i>The fact was,</i>

14:39.545 --> 14:42.592
<i>it was lonely being in</i> a <i>new
place without any friends.</i>

14:42.593 --> 14:45.264
<i>Seemed like everyone had</i>
a <i>companion already.</i>

14:45.265 --> 14:46.718
Argh!

14:46.719 --> 14:48.141
<i>Big John had Little John.</i>

14:49.639 --> 14:51.562
<i>Jimmy had his umbrella.</i>

14:53.184 --> 14:54.893
<i>Stemple had his guitar.</i>

14:56.729 --> 14:58.605
Those warriors at Wave Hill...

14:58.606 --> 15:02.818
<i>Taylor Pete had his politics
and land rights issue.</i>

15:02.819 --> 15:05.322
Gonna be a big one, boys!
Get in! Get in!

15:05.323 --> 15:06.738
Durack, get in there!

15:10.410 --> 15:11.993
What's going on?!

15:11.994 --> 15:13.995
Cyclone coming!

15:13.996 --> 15:15.956
<i>And Grandpa...</i>

15:18.835 --> 15:21.461
<i>had his gramophone.</i>

15:21.462 --> 15:24.172
The roof is anchored
to half-inch pipes

15:24.173 --> 15:27.514
fixed by 18-inch U-bolts
to vertical railway lines

15:27.515 --> 15:31.101
spaced 10 feet apart all
the way around the perimeter,

15:31.102 --> 15:33.520
sunk three feet
into solid concrete.

15:33.521 --> 15:34.891
(SMASHU

15:37.437 --> 15:39.062
So we're not gonna die?!

15:39.063 --> 15:40.736
No!

15:50.783 --> 15:52.075
- Stemple?
- Yeah?

15:52.076 --> 15:54.252
Get into the air. First off,
we've got to find the mob.

15:54.253 --> 15:56.374
Help those that are bogged
or trapped.

15:56.375 --> 15:58.668
Little and Big,
you get out to the west end.

15:58.669 --> 16:00.130
Durack and Taylor Pete,

16:00.131 --> 16:02.470
you come with me
to the northern plateau.

16:02.471 --> 16:03.920
What about me?

16:03.921 --> 16:05.967
You look for the loose chickens.

16:05.968 --> 16:07.308
Who's gonna drive?

16:08.468 --> 16:09.593
I won again!

16:51.093 --> 16:52.969
Hello. Where did you come from?

16:54.263 --> 16:56.516
OK, OK, don't worry.
I'll get you down.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.937
Oh, you're a mess.

17:01.938 --> 17:05.022
Do you have a name? No?

17:05.023 --> 17:07.367
I'm gonna call you Blue.
Because you're blue.

17:16.702 --> 17:19.287
Blue! You're red!

17:19.288 --> 17:21.330
You're red!

17:21.332 --> 17:23.583
I have a good feeling about us.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.301
I think we're gonna be
best mates.

17:29.507 --> 17:31.930
Shhh.

17:48.192 --> 17:49.694
Where'd you put him?

17:52.405 --> 17:53.827
I know you're not asleep.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.040
You even know whose that is?

18:04.041 --> 18:06.760
He's nobody's dog, Grandad.
I found him. His name's Blue.

18:06.761 --> 18:09.254
Looks more red to me.

18:09.255 --> 18:12.424
His name is Blue,
his colour is red.

18:12.425 --> 18:15.218
- That makes sense to you'?
- Yes.

18:15.219 --> 18:17.387
He's from Gujarala.

18:17.388 --> 18:20.140
Durack's cousin's visiting
from Wyndham.

18:20.141 --> 18:22.235
The pup's from his bitch.

18:28.316 --> 18:29.733
I'll talk t0 him.

18:29.734 --> 18:32.611
Thank you! Thank you, sir.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.237
On one condition.

18:34.238 --> 18:36.457
Dogs don't sleep in the house.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.670
Where's my bloody shaving cream?

20:58.048 --> 21:00.216
Oi! Oi!

21:00.217 --> 21:03.595
<i>~</i> (G _ o...

21:03.596 --> 21:05.138
Mad!

21:05.139 --> 21:07.354
Nah, that's
strychnine poisoning.

21:07.355 --> 21:08.563
Plain as day, Jimmy.

21:08.564 --> 21:09.684
Are you a vet now?

21:09.685 --> 21:11.253
No, but I bloody well know

21:11.254 --> 21:12.704
strychnine poisoning
when I see it.

21:12.705 --> 21:15.028
- Could be rabies.
- Don't think so.

21:15.029 --> 21:16.270
Look at the foam on his mouth.

21:16.271 --> 21:17.650
Marlunghu.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.073
A What?

21:20.780 --> 21:23.954
That fella,
he's a trickster marlunghu.

21:25.701 --> 21:27.294
He is.

21:32.041 --> 21:33.793
OK, come on, boy. Come on!

21:51.519 --> 21:52.771
<i>"SONG". S Honey, hi</i>

21:54.897 --> 21:56.695

21:58.108 --> 22:00.236

22:09.662 --> 22:14.668

22:19.672 --> 22:22.340
There you go.

22:23.759 --> 22:26.386
Would you like some jam
with that? It's the melon one.

22:31.225 --> 22:33.102
Whoa, boy! That was fast.

22:34.228 --> 22:35.562
You know,

22:35.563 --> 22:38.066
if we could figure out a way
to make money from fast eating,

22:38.067 --> 22:39.783
we could get mighty rich.

22:40.818 --> 22:42.536
Ready?

22:44.071 --> 22:46.531
Don't be a scaredy-cat.

22:46.532 --> 22:48.785
It's probably like
all the other caves.

22:48.786 --> 22:50.457
Nothing big, nothing scary.

23:10.139 --> 23:11.431
You see this, Blue?

23:11.432 --> 23:12.974
You go first.

23:15.853 --> 23:17.275
OK.

23:18.397 --> 23:19.981
I'll go first.

23:19.982 --> 23:21.484
No big deal.

23:34.246 --> 23:37.790
Blue, you gotta get in here
and see this.

23:37.791 --> 23:39.626
It's amazing.

23:39.627 --> 23:41.466
We can use this as a hide-out.

23:41.467 --> 23:43.338
We'll be the Ned Kelly
of the Pilbara.

23:43.339 --> 23:44.964
I'll be Ned, that is.

23:44.965 --> 23:46.888
And you'll be my best mate,
Joe Byrne,

23:46.889 --> 23:49.469
scourge of the North West.

23:49.470 --> 23:52.392
We'll bury our gold in here
and have orgies.

23:52.393 --> 23:55.061
It's an awful snug place
for orgies, I reckon.

23:55.062 --> 23:57.903
Not exactly sure what they are,
but I know all true robbers...

23:57.904 --> 24:00.688
Jeez!

24:00.689 --> 24:02.487
Don't do that!

24:04.443 --> 24:06.195
What's that?

24:17.373 --> 24:19.290
What is it, Blue?

24:29.176 --> 24:31.099
Let's get out of here!

24:46.777 --> 24:48.529
That was scary, Blue.

25:07.756 --> 25:09.465
You're late.

25:09.466 --> 25:11.300
Sorry about that.

25:11.301 --> 25:13.386
Can you keep a secret?

25:13.387 --> 25:14.807
Only me and Blue know.

25:14.808 --> 25:16.478
Well, I can keep a secret
if a dog can.

25:17.975 --> 25:19.693
He doesn't like
to be called that.

25:19.694 --> 25:21.811
A dog?

25:21.812 --> 25:24.355
We found a cave
in Gregory's Rock.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.232
That's not a place
for whitefellas.

25:26.233 --> 25:28.029
- You know it?
- Of course I know it.

25:28.030 --> 25:30.280
That's Mukkine's Cave.
Only Bunaga men go there.

25:30.281 --> 25:33.239
Manguny place, that is.
Dreamtime.

25:33.240 --> 25:35.161
How do you know it's Dreamtime?

25:35.162 --> 25:37.080
'Cause I've been there.
On Walkabout.

25:37.081 --> 25:39.250
Is walking about hard?
I mean, all that walking...

25:39.251 --> 25:42.540
Don't be daft. I didn't walk.
I took me ute.

25:42.541 --> 25:45.043
Well, did you notice anything
strange in the cave?

25:45.044 --> 25:46.919
What did you see?

25:46.920 --> 25:49.047
There was a white stone
in the pool.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.298
I tried to get it,

25:50.299 --> 25:52.097
but Blue started barking
at something fierce,

25:52.098 --> 25:53.344
something I couldn't see.

25:59.433 --> 26:00.855
What?

26:02.019 --> 26:03.396
That's not very good.

26:03.397 --> 26:05.396
What do you know of Mukkine?

26:05.397 --> 26:06.694
Nothing.

26:11.153 --> 26:16.699
Mukkine was a great ngarluma,
a magic man.

26:16.700 --> 26:20.244
Many years ago,
he shot this humbug constable

26:20.245 --> 26:22.964
who chained all of Mukkine's
mob by their necks

26:22.965 --> 26:24.957
and pegged them to this tree.

26:24.958 --> 26:27.585
Mukkine shot him dead.

26:27.586 --> 26:32.090
Plenty of coppers came from
all over just to kill Mukkine.

26:32.091 --> 26:36.010
But Mukkine made fools
of all of those coppers.

26:36.011 --> 26:39.305
They needed a blackfella
to track a blackfella,

26:39.306 --> 26:40.848
and they got one.

26:40.849 --> 26:43.351
Parker Knight from Roebourne.

26:43.352 --> 26:46.437
Parker Knight, he shot Mukkine,

26:46.438 --> 26:50.284
but you can't kill a Maban man
unless you take his spirit.

26:51.318 --> 26:53.820
So <i>as</i> Mukkine lay bleeding,

26:53.821 --> 26:56.239
he put his spirit
into that water,

26:56.240 --> 26:58.699
into Yirramala pool,

26:58.700 --> 27:00.868
in that cave.

27:00.869 --> 27:04.205
That's what Blue saw
and was barking at.

27:04.206 --> 27:06.165
Mukkine's spirit.

27:06.166 --> 27:07.708
I tell you true.

27:07.709 --> 27:09.710
That white stone
that you found in the pool,

27:09.711 --> 27:11.420
that's Mukkine's stone.

27:11.421 --> 27:13.172
That holds his power.

27:13.173 --> 27:14.715
A weapon, it is.

27:14.716 --> 27:18.886
He points that thing at you
and you die. Cursed.

27:18.887 --> 27:20.432
And now that he knows you,

27:20.433 --> 27:23.182
he might take his stone
and he'll come looking.

27:23.183 --> 27:24.728
Why would he come
looking for me?

27:24.729 --> 27:27.103
- You stole his land.
- I didn't steal nothing.

27:27.104 --> 27:30.859
Your family, Mr Hudson, you
whitefellas take everything.

27:32.192 --> 27:34.741
I don't want no spirit
coming after me and Blue.

27:36.363 --> 27:38.536
You're gonna need a token
for protection.

27:44.204 --> 27:46.372
This is it.

27:46.373 --> 27:48.626
Very strong magic, this one.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.596
What's in the tin?

27:54.047 --> 27:55.390
His name's Ted.

27:57.593 --> 27:59.760
He's our pet.

27:59.761 --> 28:01.304
Blue has a pet?

28:01.305 --> 28:03.023
Well, yeah.

28:04.349 --> 28:06.067
- Trade.
- Done.

28:15.402 --> 28:18.372
Yahoooo!

28:19.907 --> 28:21.659
Crazy wadjbala bloke.

28:25.662 --> 28:28.497
On, yeah!

28:28.498 --> 28:30.124
18-10.

29:04.534 --> 29:06.002

He won't shut up.

29:07.329 --> 29:09.705
When I sing, he won't shut up.

29:09.706 --> 29:11.420
Must be the dumbest dog
I've ever met.

29:11.421 --> 29:13.712
Hey, what are you talking
about? He's smarter than me.

29:13.713 --> 29:15.132
That's not a recommendation.

29:16.213 --> 29:17.880
Can he do any tricks?

29:17.881 --> 29:19.632
Can he sit?

29:19.633 --> 29:20.928
He's already sitting.

29:20.929 --> 29:23.678
No, like sit down,
shake hands, roll over.

29:23.679 --> 29:26.353
No? Nothing?

29:29.810 --> 29:32.478
What about play dead?
Can he play dead?

29:32.479 --> 29:34.188
Hey. Hey, Blue.

29:34.189 --> 29:35.606
Can you be dead?

29:38.318 --> 29:40.065
We'll start off with
a few of the easy ones

29:40.066 --> 29:41.112
to shut him up.

29:41.113 --> 29:43.406
Like sit. You know how to sit.

29:43.407 --> 29:45.034
Everybody knows how to sit.

29:45.035 --> 29:47.411
Ready, set, sit.

29:50.330 --> 29:53.082
OK, OK. You probably don't
understand the process.

29:53.083 --> 29:56.087
I give a command, you perform
it. That's what a trick is.

29:57.212 --> 29:58.632
I'll show you how it works.

29:58.633 --> 30:01.429
You give me a command
and then I'll do it.

30:01.430 --> 30:04.218
Then we can switch places. OK?

30:04.219 --> 30:06.688
Go ahead. Give a command.

30:08.765 --> 30:10.891
See? Easy. Try something else.

30:32.289 --> 30:35.333
Jimmy! Another plate.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.007
We're going to be having
company.

30:44.217 --> 30:47.303
Michael, this is Mr Hancock.

30:47.304 --> 30:49.263
Ah.

30:49.264 --> 30:51.432
So, you're Cate's boy?

30:51.433 --> 30:53.059
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

30:53.060 --> 30:55.188
Well, I remember your mum
when she was

30:55.189 --> 30:57.897
no more than, 0h, yea high.

30:57.898 --> 30:59.900
She had the prettiest smile.

31:01.234 --> 31:02.985
Comb your hair.

31:02.986 --> 31:06.614
Oh. Allowing dogs
in the house now?

31:06.615 --> 31:08.117
Oh, Blue has privileges.

31:08.118 --> 31:09.492
You're getting soft.

31:09.493 --> 31:12.161
Mr Hancock here
is up at Mulga Downs.

31:12.162 --> 31:15.002
<i>When</i> he's up at Mulga Downs,
which isn't so much these days,

31:15.003 --> 31:16.999
he has other,
more important interests.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.422
What are your other
interests, sir?

31:20.003 --> 31:21.175
Allow me.

31:24.674 --> 31:26.008
Now, that -

31:26.009 --> 31:28.427
that is the future of this land.

31:28.428 --> 31:32.019
Not that mob of wild shorthorns
in the bush out yonder.

31:32.020 --> 31:33.729
Your grandpa thinks
he's a futurist

31:33.730 --> 31:35.564
'cause he got rid of his horses

31:35.565 --> 31:38.564
and now he musters with
motorbikes and helicopters.

31:38.565 --> 31:40.314
But I call a spade a spade,

31:40.315 --> 31:43.785
and you can't make a spade
without that there.

31:44.861 --> 31:47.321
- What is it'?
- Iron ore.

31:47.322 --> 31:49.161
We have iron ore
on the property, Grandpa?

31:49.162 --> 31:50.329
Not enough.

31:50.330 --> 31:53.619
But if you go
180 miles thataway,

31:53.620 --> 31:55.714
they're building the biggest
mine on the planet,

31:55.715 --> 31:57.123
Mount Tom Price.

31:57.124 --> 31:58.715
And then they're gonna run
the railroad

31:58.716 --> 32:00.334
straight through
your grandpa's property

32:00.335 --> 32:01.919
to get to Dampier.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.296
- Is that good?
- No.

32:04.297 --> 32:05.631
Isn't it our land?

32:05.632 --> 32:07.177
I can't stop it.

32:07.178 --> 32:09.394
Not if it's in the public's
bloody interest.

32:09.395 --> 32:11.262
- You could sell it.
- Ha!

32:11.263 --> 32:13.231
Taylor Pete said
it isn't even our land.

32:13.232 --> 32:14.640
Taylor Pete?

32:14.641 --> 32:16.492
This is our land.
I have the deed to prove it.

32:16.493 --> 32:17.857
But it was their land.

32:17.858 --> 32:19.696
Haven't you got
anything stronger

32:19.697 --> 32:21.897
to go with this tucker, Ronald?

32:21.898 --> 32:23.320
Take your meal into your room.

32:23.321 --> 32:24.613
Yes, sir.

32:31.032 --> 32:32.700
I've neglected
the boy's education.

32:32.701 --> 32:34.394
Oh, he'd be off to school
in the big smoke

32:34.395 --> 32:35.754
soon enough, wouldn't he?

32:35.755 --> 32:37.167
Next year.

32:39.332 --> 32:43.461
Cate's still in that, uh...
hospital?

32:43.462 --> 32:45.552
They released her
six months back.

32:45.553 --> 32:47.470
And didn't come and see her boy?

32:48.592 --> 32:51.010
Nope. Disappeared into Sydney.

32:51.011 --> 32:52.845
Not even a postcard.

32:52.846 --> 32:54.805
Well, does the boy know?

32:54.806 --> 32:56.149
No.

32:57.809 --> 32:59.602
I don't understand her.

32:59.603 --> 33:03.232
My daughter's a
bloody mystery, way she thinks.

33:03.233 --> 33:06.075
Got more twists and turns
than the Fortescue!

33:07.152 --> 33:09.904
No matter how hard
the duck tried to run,

33:09.905 --> 33:11.703
she couldn't escape the wolf.

33:11.704 --> 33:14.575
He was getting nearer, nearer,

33:14.576 --> 33:15.868
HGQFGF...

33:15.869 --> 33:18.746
Hey, I love this!
Peter and the...

33:21.917 --> 33:23.792
Are you OK, Mr Hancock?

33:23.793 --> 33:25.336
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

33:25.337 --> 33:26.805
Come on, dog, get off, get off.

33:28.340 --> 33:29.965
Sorry, Mr Hancock.

33:29.966 --> 33:32.034
Blue gets very territorial
about his sitting spots.

33:32.035 --> 33:34.146
I wouldn't try to move him.
It wouldn't be safe.

33:34.147 --> 33:36.805
Yeah, well,
we'll see about that.

33:44.606 --> 33:45.858
Feeling himself caught,

33:45.859 --> 33:48.701
the wolf began to jump wildly,
trying to get loose.

33:59.162 --> 34:00.913
Hey, Lang!
Where are you, old man?

34:00.914 --> 34:02.882
You've fallen down
and can't get up?

34:02.883 --> 34:04.917
I'm coming.

34:04.918 --> 34:07.387
Well, you two... carry on.

34:12.592 --> 34:13.844
What a strange man.

34:19.724 --> 34:21.475
OK, no cheating this time.

34:21.476 --> 34:24.355
You count to 50, and no peeking
where I hide the duck.

34:39.786 --> 34:41.504
- YEP-
- Yep-

34:46.126 --> 34:48.127
- You ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

34:48.128 --> 34:49.675
Here we go.

35:40.805 --> 35:42.352
No!

35:43.266 --> 35:44.516
Come here, Blue!

35:54.110 --> 35:55.532
Blue!

35:57.781 --> 35:59.203
Argh!

36:05.372 --> 36:07.921
Hey, not fair.
No going into the paddock.

36:44.244 --> 36:45.712
Blue?

36:48.665 --> 36:50.207
Blue?

37:31.791 --> 37:33.250
That was crazy!

37:38.173 --> 37:41.848
Aaaaaaah!

37:51.436 --> 37:53.564
What's that?

38:00.361 --> 38:02.284

38:25.804 --> 38:27.806

to have more sense.

I've been scarred.

That's not a scar,
mate. You want to see a scar?

39:45.091 --> 39:47.050
Vietnam, baby. Vietnam.

39:47.051 --> 39:48.553
That little thing?

39:52.015 --> 39:53.932
Wow. Did it hurt?

39:53.933 --> 39:55.934
Don't be daft.
Of course it hurt!

39:55.935 --> 39:57.769
Dunno if self-inflicted
counts, mate.

39:57.770 --> 39:59.864
- Yeah, well, I didn't do it.
- Was it a punishment?

39:59.865 --> 40:01.315
Education.

40:01.316 --> 40:02.733
I'm getting that too.

40:02.734 --> 40:05.449
Grandpa thinks
I'm not properly educated.

40:05.450 --> 40:07.321
He's hired some old woman
from Perth

40:07.322 --> 40:08.906
to come live with us

40:08.907 --> 40:11.786
and make sure I do
all my correspondence sets

40:11.787 --> 40:13.744
all day long.

40:13.745 --> 40:16.874
At the mission schools, all
the sisters look like goannas.

40:16.875 --> 40:18.546
Yeah, I bet she has warts.

40:18.547 --> 40:21.627
Hair growing out of them.
On her nose.

40:21.628 --> 40:23.676
I don't even want an education.

40:24.714 --> 40:26.091
I remember this one boy

40:26.092 --> 40:28.388
that the nuns had taught
a thousand lines of the Bible

40:28.389 --> 40:29.676
all up in his head.

40:29.677 --> 40:31.011
So?

40:31.012 --> 40:32.480
He become an idiot, he did.

40:32.481 --> 40:34.431
No worries.

40:34.432 --> 40:36.592
Between you and your dog,
you're already halfway there.

40:59.999 --> 41:01.917
- Hello, Doctor.
- Mick.

41:01.918 --> 41:04.046
Have a vaccination for the lads.

41:04.047 --> 41:05.716
Gonna need to
gather them all up.

41:05.717 --> 41:07.841
I was told to meet my new tutor.

41:07.842 --> 41:09.513
Mrs Marble. Is she in there?

41:10.760 --> 41:12.975
Supposed to help her
get situated.

41:12.976 --> 41:15.190
<i>Was she old and horrible
and hairy, Dad?</i>

41:15.191 --> 41:17.015
Uh... no.

41:17.016 --> 41:18.734
Did she have those big
nose warts?

41:18.735 --> 41:20.602
No. No nose warts.

41:20.603 --> 41:23.814
But she looked like
a big goanna lizard, right?

41:23.815 --> 41:25.315
No.

41:40.206 --> 41:43.333
Ugh! Then what was she like?

41:43.334 --> 41:46.753
Sh-she was, uh... pretty...

41:46.754 --> 41:48.347
nice-looking.

41:49.507 --> 41:51.341
I thought.

41:51.342 --> 41:52.762
Mick. This is Miss Marble.

41:52.763 --> 41:54.761
Hello, Mick.
Please, call me Betty.

41:54.762 --> 41:57.139
Mick will see you situated.

41:57.140 --> 41:58.642
And Who's this?

42:01.394 --> 42:03.311
Blue, Mrs...

42:03.312 --> 42:05.230
Miss Marb...

42:05.231 --> 42:06.440
Bet... Marble.

42:06.441 --> 42:07.649
Just Betty.

42:07.650 --> 42:10.110
Do you have bags... Betty?

42:10.111 --> 42:12.738
Two. But they are quite heavy.

42:12.739 --> 42:15.037
Oh, I'm stronger than I look.

42:27.253 --> 42:28.971
Oh.

42:31.674 --> 42:34.473
Come on. What are you doing'?
Doctor's giving shots.

42:42.351 --> 42:44.024
It's enough
to make one a believer

42:44.025 --> 42:46.354
in our educational system, eh?

42:46.355 --> 42:48.323
It's gonna be
pretty embarrassing for you.

42:48.324 --> 42:49.691
What?

42:49.692 --> 42:52.527
- Taking a shot in the bum.
- No way.

42:52.528 --> 42:54.199
Look, mate,
men take shots in the arm,

42:54.200 --> 42:55.617
children take shots in the bum.

42:55.618 --> 42:56.828
It's the way it is.

42:56.829 --> 42:59.247
- I'm not a child.
- So you'd like to believe.

43:01.537 --> 43:02.996
Roll up your sleeve.

43:02.997 --> 43:05.841
Yeah, it's just a bit tight,
Doc. This might help.

43:07.543 --> 43:08.960
G'day.

43:08.961 --> 43:11.680
Don't think we've met.
Uh, Bill Stemple.

43:11.681 --> 43:13.298
Hello. Betty.

43:13.299 --> 43:14.549
Betty.

43:14.550 --> 43:16.301
(E-'day, Betty.
Welcome to Warndurala.

43:16.302 --> 43:19.262
Have to give you a tour
round the station sometime.

43:19.263 --> 43:21.156
Course, the best way to see it
is from the air.

43:21.157 --> 43:22.566
You ever taken a ride
in a helic...

43:22.567 --> 43:23.767
helicopter?

43:23.768 --> 43:25.611
Next.

43:29.774 --> 43:31.242
Not in the bum.

43:31.243 --> 43:32.442
Can't hear you.

43:32.443 --> 43:33.819
Not in the bum!

43:33.820 --> 43:35.115
For God's sake, speak up!

43:35.116 --> 43:36.581
He said not in the bum!

43:40.952 --> 43:42.374
Eeeh!

43:45.081 --> 43:47.541
Just use them
when you need them.

43:47.542 --> 43:49.510
And give us a holler
if it gets worse, Ron.

43:49.511 --> 43:51.044
Will do.

43:51.045 --> 43:53.173
- Make sure you take 'em.
- Yeah, yeah.

43:57.635 --> 44:00.764
The sun on the red dirt.
Beautiful. You'll love it.

44:00.765 --> 44:02.514
I'll have to check my schedule.

44:02.515 --> 44:04.563
Betty. Walk with me.

44:09.480 --> 44:11.064
Ron's a good man,

44:11.065 --> 44:12.758
but if I could give you
a piece of advice?

44:12.759 --> 44:14.172
What would that be?

44:15.153 --> 44:16.903
Avoid helicopter rides.

44:16.904 --> 44:19.156
I'll try to remember.

44:19.157 --> 44:21.455
When I see your parents,
I'll tell them you're fine.

44:21.456 --> 44:23.326
It's going to be fun.

44:23.327 --> 44:25.996
- You're not afraid'?
- Of what?

44:25.997 --> 44:28.248
Lonely men on a lonely land.

44:28.249 --> 44:29.791
I like lonely.

44:29.792 --> 44:31.214
Yeah.

44:44.307 --> 44:46.275
- Boys.
- Thanks for the shots, Doc.

45:38.903 --> 45:40.075
Out!

45:57.630 --> 45:59.094
Good morning, Mick.

45:59.095 --> 46:00.303
Good morning, Betty.

46:00.304 --> 46:02.300
Ready for a brilliant day
of education?

46:02.301 --> 46:03.969
You bet.

46:05.972 --> 46:08.723
What's that... awful smell?

46:08.724 --> 46:10.600
Oh, Blue has digestion issues.

46:10.601 --> 46:12.190
Don't worry, you get used to it.

46:12.191 --> 46:13.733
There's no way
to get used to that.

46:13.734 --> 46:16.147
My God! It's intolerable!

46:16.148 --> 46:18.233
He has to go.

46:18.234 --> 46:19.901
But Blue has privileges.

46:19.902 --> 46:21.866
I can't kick him out.
It's his house too.

46:21.867 --> 46:23.489
It's me or the dog, Mick.

46:28.035 --> 46:29.662
Out. Go!

46:41.549 --> 46:43.388
So we have Tom and <i>Sally</i>

46:43.389 --> 46:45.478

46:45.479 --> 46:48.513
- How are you all doing?
- Good. Over.

46:48.514 --> 46:50.059

46:50.060 --> 46:52.478

46:52.479 --> 46:54.227

49:30.426 --> 49:32.427
Know what?

49:32.428 --> 49:34.429
I know why you're looking
out that window.

49:34.430 --> 49:35.852
You do?

49:41.854 --> 49:43.688
You want to be out there.

49:43.689 --> 49:45.190
Oh, yes.

49:45.191 --> 49:48.359
Somewhere else.
Somewhere exciting.

49:48.360 --> 49:50.945
You stare out there
and you think...

49:50.946 --> 49:53.198
"Why can't I just run away?"

49:53.199 --> 49:55.372
I-is that what you did?

49:56.619 --> 49:59.996
I got out of Perth.
It's a start.

49:59.997 --> 50:02.375
But I want to go to Paris,
London...

50:03.876 --> 50:05.752
In San Francisco,
they just had something

50:05.753 --> 50:07.754
called the Summer of Love.

50:07.755 --> 50:09.302
Isn't that wonderful?

50:10.841 --> 50:12.639
Don't you want to have
a summer of love?

50:13.594 --> 50:15.720
No!

50:15.721 --> 50:17.263
I mean, yes!

50:17.264 --> 50:19.232
Yes, of course. Yes.

50:21.143 --> 50:23.019
Are you alright?

50:23.020 --> 50:25.396
S-stomach. I have to go.

50:25.397 --> 50:27.065
Oh, sorry. Of course.

50:27.066 --> 50:28.613
It's the end of the day anyway.

50:28.614 --> 50:30.111
OK.

50:49.463 --> 50:52.215
Serves you right
for being a degenerate.

50:54.343 --> 50:56.687
Alright, don't get your tail
in a twist.

51:00.724 --> 51:02.397
What do we do with this?

51:10.025 --> 51:12.323
Hello, Miss Abby.
It's a lovely day, isn't it?

51:19.785 --> 51:21.244
Come here.

51:21.245 --> 51:22.622
I found a snake this big.

51:22.623 --> 51:24.792

51:24.793 --> 51:26.292
I don't think I'd come back.

51:27.334 --> 51:29.380
- Here, I'll get that for you.
- This looks nice.

51:29.381 --> 51:30.967
What's he doing here?

51:30.968 --> 51:32.806
- <i>I</i> invited him.
- Why?

51:32.807 --> 51:34.299
Because I wanted to.

51:34.300 --> 51:36.428
You know, I asked Bill
what they did on the station

51:36.429 --> 51:37.552
besides work.

51:37.553 --> 51:39.155
He said all they did
was play ping-pong.

51:39.156 --> 51:40.975
I get the boys movies
every other month.

51:40.976 --> 51:42.812
And there's fishing
and swimming.

51:42.813 --> 51:45.027
And Roebourne has other
socialising amenities.

51:45.028 --> 51:46.519
Well, <i>as</i> I've said,

51:46.520 --> 51:49.069
we've all gotten very good
at playing ping-pong.

51:49.070 --> 51:50.940
As will you.

51:50.941 --> 51:53.362
I'm already an excellent
player, thank you very much.

51:53.363 --> 51:54.703
Is that a challenge?

51:54.704 --> 51:56.237
It is.

51:56.238 --> 51:57.956
- Thank you, Jimmy.
- Stemple sings.

51:59.867 --> 52:01.369
Really? What do you sing?

52:01.370 --> 52:03.995
Uh, rock'n'r0ll.
Bit of guitar too.

52:03.996 --> 52:05.541
Well, you should
sing us something.

52:05.542 --> 52:07.540
- Oh, later.
- Well, don't be shy.

52:07.541 --> 52:08.793
Yeah. Please?

52:09.960 --> 52:11.961
Uh... OK.

52:15.132 --> 52:17.510

with my guitar, but, um...

52:31.276 --> 52:34.320
And when Stemple sings.
Isn't that hilarious?

52:34.321 --> 52:35.786
Yeah, well, everyone's a critic.

52:43.577 --> 52:45.124
Ever been to Paris?

52:45.125 --> 52:47.043
- I have.
- What's it like?

52:48.582 --> 52:50.004
They like cheese.

52:51.251 --> 52:52.794

52:52.795 --> 52:55.213
- How about San Francisco?
- Nah.

52:55.214 --> 52:57.888
- Don't you want to go?
- Why?

52:59.301 --> 53:02.428
It's... it's where
it's happening.

53:02.429 --> 53:04.056
It was 'happening'
in Saigon too.

53:06.850 --> 53:08.067
Whoo!

53:12.773 --> 53:14.841
You want me to grow my hair
long and become a hippy.

53:14.842 --> 53:16.609

53:35.379 --> 53:37.380
Yeah. Exactly.

53:37.381 --> 53:39.679
Why would you even care?
She was so old.

53:39.680 --> 53:43.511
Well... l had that
all worked out.

53:43.512 --> 53:45.263
I know there's an age problem,

53:45.264 --> 53:47.354
but it's just six years
between me and Betty

53:47.355 --> 53:49.395
and six years between
Betty and Stemple.

53:49.396 --> 53:52.397
So the way I'm figuring,
it's all sort of a wash.

53:53.397 --> 53:55.898
I was engaged age 12.

53:55.899 --> 53:57.901
Wow! How did that happen?

53:59.111 --> 54:00.862
Family arranged it.

54:00.863 --> 54:02.697
Do you think it's stupid?

54:02.698 --> 54:05.247
All love's stupid,
mate. It's what love is.

54:05.248 --> 54:07.285
Do you want to know a secret?

54:07.286 --> 54:09.954
Me and Big John,
we're not brothers.

54:09.955 --> 54:11.581
You're not?

54:11.582 --> 54:13.040
No, we're close.

54:13.041 --> 54:15.385
In fact, we're so close that
people think we're brothers,

54:15.386 --> 54:16.879
so we let them.

54:18.589 --> 54:20.387
You understand what I'm saying?

54:20.388 --> 54:21.674
No.

54:21.675 --> 54:24.265
She doesn't like me
or think of me that way.

54:24.266 --> 54:27.183
And I don't mean the pregnant
way. That's disgusting.

54:27.184 --> 54:29.400
But she thinks of Stemple
in that way.

54:29.401 --> 54:30.767
The pregnant way.

54:30.768 --> 54:32.643
What should I do?

54:32.644 --> 54:34.859
You're gonna have to fight him.
You got a weapon?

54:34.860 --> 54:37.108
No. Do you have one
I can borrow?

54:37.109 --> 54:38.649
Nope.

54:40.611 --> 54:43.740
What about that stone?
You know, Mukkine's stone.

54:43.741 --> 54:45.241
You said that was a weapon.

54:45.242 --> 54:47.705

- That magic is not for you.

01:04:50.637 --> 01:04:52.262

we'll find a ship.

01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:46.868
We're gonna work our way
to San Francisco.

01:05:46.869 --> 01:05:48.152
That's in America.

01:05:48.153 --> 01:05:49.319
Yeah, I know where it is.

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:50.671
You can come with us
if you want.

01:05:50.672 --> 01:05:52.324
Tempting, it is,
but I'll be headed soon

01:05:52.325 --> 01:05:54.246
to Wattie Creek and Wave Hill.

01:05:54.247 --> 01:05:56.085
My uncle is a Gurindji man.

01:05:57.370 --> 01:05:58.996
We're gonna take back our land,
we are.

01:05:58.997 --> 01:06:00.419
I wish you luck.

01:06:16.723 --> 01:06:19.770
<i>Dear Betty,
Thank you for the education.</i>

01:06:19.771 --> 01:06:21.062
<i>I hope we meet again,</i>

01:06:21.063 --> 01:06:23.779
<i>perhaps across the seas
in a summer of love.</i>

01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:26.440
<i>Most sincerely yours,
Mick and Blue.</i>

01:06:26.441 --> 01:06:28.192
Mr Hudson?

01:06:28.193 --> 01:06:30.527
Mr Hudson!

01:06:30.528 --> 01:06:32.371
I think Mick has run away!

01:06:37.410 --> 01:06:39.119
Come on!

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:41.043
Oh-ho! Yeah!

01:07:26.459 --> 01:07:28.803
It's heading towards
the homestead, Blue.

01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:47.989
Mr Hudson,
we're running out of water!

01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:49.690
- Grandpa!
- Michael!

01:07:49.691 --> 01:07:51.530
Michael, you go
with Taylor Pete.

01:07:51.531 --> 01:07:52.946
Help him refill the drum.

01:07:52.947 --> 01:07:55.163
Thought you would have been
a fearsome outlaw by now.

01:07:55.164 --> 01:07:56.655
How did it happen?

01:07:56.656 --> 01:07:59.074
I don't know.
Angry spirits, maybe?

01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:00.497
What do you reckon?

01:08:01.703 --> 01:08:04.172
How would I know?
They ain't my spirits.

01:08:49.042 --> 01:08:50.881
That fire's a marlunghu, it is.

01:08:50.881 --> 01:08:52.379
Everything's a marlunghu to you.

01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:54.051
Only when it's trying
to kill me!

01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:03.220
I'll be back.

01:09:03.221 --> 01:09:04.640
Where are you going?

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.268
There's something I have to do.

01:09:53.231 --> 01:09:55.029
This has brought me
and everyone else

01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:56.650
nothing but trouble.

01:09:56.651 --> 01:09:58.610
I was wrong to take it.

01:09:58.611 --> 01:10:00.701
I hope, Mr Mukkine, sir...

01:10:00.702 --> 01:10:02.290
you can accept my apology.

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:36.908
Bugger!

01:10:39.694 --> 01:10:43.119
You've never
experienced true darkness.

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:45.407
There's always some light.

01:10:45.408 --> 01:10:47.617
An exit sign or...

01:10:47.618 --> 01:10:49.953
a light from a phone or a TV,

01:10:49.954 --> 01:10:51.621
or even the stars.

01:10:51.622 --> 01:10:55.417
But blackness - true blackness -

01:10:55.418 --> 01:10:58.003
has a power all of its own.

01:10:58.004 --> 01:11:00.464
It doesn't just swallow light.

01:11:00.465 --> 01:11:02.888
It's like it swallows your soul.

01:11:25.698 --> 01:11:27.746
<i>How'd you get out?</i>

01:11:37.376 --> 01:11:38.835
Blue.

01:11:38.836 --> 01:11:40.679
<i>He saved my life.</i>

01:11:41.714 --> 01:11:43.933
<i>He pushed close
and I held on to his tail,</i>

01:11:43.934 --> 01:11:45.768
<i>and he led me out.</i>

01:11:55.353 --> 01:11:57.026
Stemple, up here!

01:11:57.980 --> 01:11:59.402
Here, Jimmy!

01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:04.611
Here! Take this!

01:12:04.612 --> 01:12:06.404
Over here!

01:12:17.166 --> 01:12:19.589
<i>We fought it
up to the base of the ridge,</i>

01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:22.462
<i>the homestead on the other side.</i>

01:12:22.463 --> 01:12:25.012
<i>Nothing we did could stop it.</i>

01:12:28.928 --> 01:12:31.888
<i>And then</i> - <i>I don't know</i> -

01:12:31.889 --> 01:12:34.984
<i>maybe the spirits
changed their mind.</i>

01:12:37.019 --> 01:12:38.770
<i>The wind turned</i>

01:12:38.771 --> 01:12:41.115
<i>and the fire pushed back
on itself.</i>

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:46.116
<i>As suddenly as it had started...</i>

01:12:47.530 --> 01:12:48.989
<i>"it was over."</i>

01:13:16.601 --> 01:13:18.353
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

01:13:20.396 --> 01:13:23.023
For running away
and other things.

01:13:23.024 --> 01:13:24.863
Don't know about
the other things,

01:13:24.864 --> 01:13:26.577
but we all run away
some time or other.

01:13:28.821 --> 01:13:30.664
It's how we return
that means something.

01:13:32.116 --> 01:13:33.663
Shows who we are.

01:13:42.752 --> 01:13:45.380
I'm a stubborn man.

01:13:47.548 --> 01:13:49.016
On a hard land.

01:13:51.594 --> 01:13:54.063
Never told your mother
just how much she means to me.

01:13:56.307 --> 01:13:58.725
But know this.

01:13:58.726 --> 01:13:59.935
You may go away,

01:13:59.936 --> 01:14:02.608
but there'll always be a home
here for you, with me.

01:14:02.609 --> 01:14:04.607
Just know that,
'cause that's the truth.

01:14:06.567 --> 01:14:08.035
I know.

01:15:05.418 --> 01:15:07.002
OK, then'?

01:15:07.003 --> 01:15:09.677
OK. I guess we'll...

01:15:10.923 --> 01:15:12.882
Write when you can.

01:15:12.883 --> 01:15:14.931
Aren't you taking me
to Port Hedland?

01:15:14.932 --> 01:15:16.725
No, Stemple is.

01:15:18.097 --> 01:15:19.973
OK.

01:15:19.974 --> 01:15:21.567
OK, then.

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:47.629
You're taking me
to Port Hedland Airstrip?

01:15:47.630 --> 01:15:50.004
Yeah. I've got to pick up
some parts.

01:15:58.095 --> 01:15:59.563
Rub hard.

01:16:04.018 --> 01:16:05.565
Rub nice and deep.

01:16:09.023 --> 01:16:10.696
Now it'll never come out.

01:16:11.942 --> 01:16:14.616
It may disappear,
but it'll always be there.

01:16:16.155 --> 01:16:17.532
To remember.

01:16:26.123 --> 01:16:28.041
Blue...

01:16:28.042 --> 01:16:29.584
I'm going away now

01:16:29.585 --> 01:16:31.929
and it's gonna be a while
before I can come back.

01:16:31.930 --> 01:16:34.589
I need you to stay here.

01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:36.316
I promise I'll come back
as soon as I can,

01:16:36.317 --> 01:16:37.819
but please stay.

01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:40.683
Stay for me.

01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:48.705
Stay, Blue, stay!

01:17:48.706 --> 01:17:50.925
Please stay!

01:19:26.428 --> 01:19:28.897
He didn't stay, did he?

01:19:30.349 --> 01:19:31.896
No.

01:19:44.571 --> 01:19:47.532
<i>For a while,
he hung around the station.</i>

01:19:54.206 --> 01:19:56.504
<i>Then I heard he visited
Miaree Pool.</i>

01:20:04.383 --> 01:20:06.135
<i>The northern plateau.</i>

01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:13.230
<i>And even hitchhiked rides into
Roebourne and Port Hedland.</i>

01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:20.567
<i>But his wandering went
further and longer...</i>

01:20:23.402 --> 01:20:24.870
<i>and then one day...</i>

01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:28.656
<i>he didn't come back.</i>

01:20:28.657 --> 01:20:30.079
<i>He was gone.</i>

01:20:31.744 --> 01:20:33.578
And Blue became Red.

01:20:33.579 --> 01:20:37.373
Well, I don't know for sure,
but I think so.

01:20:37.374 --> 01:20:40.543
That town really cared for him,
so I hope so.

01:20:40.544 --> 01:20:42.920
- And you, Dad'?
- Me?

01:20:42.921 --> 01:20:45.219
Well... you know
what happened to me.

01:20:45.220 --> 01:20:47.300
L... l finished school,

01:20:47.301 --> 01:20:50.475
I finally made it to university
in San Francisco...

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:53.139
and then...

01:20:54.892 --> 01:20:57.939
one summer,
I met and fell in love with...

01:20:57.940 --> 01:21:00.188
this amazing girl from Sydney.

01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:01.689
Your mum.

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:06.361
I came home, got married,
started work and...

01:21:06.362 --> 01:21:09.206
"eventually, we were
lucky enough..."

01:21:10.699 --> 01:21:13.451
to have two fantastic
little boys.

01:21:13.452 --> 01:21:15.078
You see?

01:21:15.079 --> 01:21:17.955
Not all stories end sadly, Theo.

01:21:17.956 --> 01:21:19.879
Change isn't always bad.

01:21:21.168 --> 01:21:24.297
The good memories we have,
we get to keep.

01:21:30.302 --> 01:21:32.020
I love you, Dad.

01:21:34.848 --> 01:21:36.441
Love you too, Theo.

01:21:57.788 --> 01:21:59.247
Hey.

01:21:59.248 --> 01:22:00.748
Oh. Hey.

01:22:00.749 --> 01:22:02.217
How was your night?

01:22:03.794 --> 01:22:05.637
- Mmm.
- Mmm!

01:22:07.047 --> 01:22:08.640
I'm guessing it was good.

01:22:08.641 --> 01:22:11.175
Listen, I was thinking -

01:22:11.176 --> 01:22:13.304
and please don't
fight me on this...

01:22:14.471 --> 01:22:16.018
I think we should
get Theo a dog.

01:22:17.433 --> 01:22:18.855
What do you say?

01:22:24.112 --> 01:22:25.898
- Mmm.
- Is that a yes?

01:22:25.899 --> 01:22:27.321
Yes.
