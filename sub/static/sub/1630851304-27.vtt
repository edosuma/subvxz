WEBVTT

00:01.689 --> 00:05.862
PREVIOUSLY ON
"BIG BROTHER": THE COOKOUT

00:05.896 --> 00:08.034
ALLIANCE MASTERFULLY STAYED
HIDDEN.

00:08.068 --> 00:12.000
ONE, TWO, THREE, COOKOUT!

00:12.034 --> 00:15.413
...BECAUSE THEY
WERE EACH WORKING IN DUOS

00:15.448 --> 00:16.689
OUTSIDE THE GROUP.

00:16.724 --> 00:17.344
IF ONE OF THE COUPOS ENDS UP
ON THE BLOCK, THE COOKOUT HAS

00:17.379 --> 00:19.655
THE NUMBERS TO KEEP US SAFE.

00:19.689 --> 00:26.103
BY A VOTE OF 5-1,
SARAH BETH, YOU ARE EVICTED FROM

00:26.137 --> 00:28.172
THE "BIG BROTHER" HOUSE.

00:28.206 --> 00:31.448
THE COOKOUT
PLANNED TO TAKE CLAIRE OUT NEXT.

00:31.482 --> 00:36.034
CLAIRE IS STARTING TO PUT THE
PIECES OF THIS TOGETHER.

00:36.068 --> 00:38.655
AND THAT'S WHY SHE SHOULD GO
FIRST.

00:38.689 --> 00:41.482
AND TIFFANY
SEEMED ON BOARD OF NOT WINNING

00:41.517 --> 00:56.931
H.O.H. SO THEY COULD TARGET HER
B.F.F.

00:56.965 --> 00:59.793
BUT AT THE HEAD
OF HOUSEHOLD COMPETITION,

00:59.827 --> 01:01.344
TIFFANY REFUSED TO THROW IT.

01:01.379 --> 01:04.310
I HAVEN'T TOUCHED THE BLOCK,
AND I'M NOT TOUCHING THE BLOCK

01:04.344 --> 01:05.862
IF I DON'T HAVE TO.

01:05.896 --> 01:08.034
...GIVING THE
FORMER QUEEN THE CROWN ONCE

01:08.068 --> 01:08.310
AGAIN.

01:08.344 --> 01:09.241
OH!

01:09.275 --> 01:11.103
CONGRATULATIONS, TIFFANY, YOU

01:11.137 --> 01:13.068
ARE NOW THE NEW HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD.

01:13.103 --> 01:15.586
AND HER PLAN WAS
TO KEEP HER NONCOOKOUT

01:15.620 --> 01:16.896
KIDNAPPION SAFE.

01:16.931 --> 01:19.586
I WANT CLAIRE TO STAY, AND I
CAME UP WITH A MASTER PLAN, AND,

01:19.620 --> 01:24.551
THEREFORE, I SHOULD BE ABLE TO
KEEP MY PERSON.

01:24.586 --> 01:27.551
THE COOKOUT WAS
NOT HAPPY WITH TIFFANY GOING

01:27.586 --> 01:28.793
ROGUE.

01:28.827 --> 01:31.793
I'M WORRIED SHE WILL TAKE
THAT SHOT AT US AND TAKE US OUT.

01:31.827 --> 01:35.241
OH, THIS WEEK IS FULLY
BRINGING OUT MY SAVAGE SIDE.

01:35.275 --> 01:37.620
AND KNOWING HIS
FRIEND ALYSSA WOULD BE TARGETED,

01:37.655 --> 01:39.793
"X" WAS ESPECIALLY P.O.'d.

01:39.827 --> 01:42.206
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE WON H.O.H.

01:42.241 --> 01:45.931
NOW YOU'VE GIVEN ME REASON TO
RUIN YOUR GAME.

01:45.965 --> 01:48.655
AT THE
NOMINATION CEREMONY...

01:48.689 --> 01:53.310
I HAVE NOMINATED YOU, ALYSSA,
AND YOU, XAVIER.

01:53.344 --> 01:57.310
...TIFFANY
OFFICIALLY SET HER SIGHTS ON

01:57.344 --> 01:58.586
ALYSSA.

01:58.620 --> 02:00.206
THE COOKOUT MAY HAVE WANTED
CLAIRE GONE THIS WEEK, BUT THIS

02:00.241 --> 02:02.000
IS MY H.O.H.

02:02.034 --> 02:05.103
TONIGHT, WILL
THE POWER OF VETO HELP TIFFANY

02:05.137 --> 02:06.206
COMPLETE HER PLAN?

02:06.241 --> 02:10.448
OR WILL ONE OF THE NOMINEES BE
SAVED FROM THE BLOCK?

02:10.482 --> 02:15.379
PLUS, THE COOKOUT IS ABOUT TO BE
ROASTED, BECAUSE ZINGBOT IS BACK

02:15.413 --> 02:17.344
WITH ZINGERS FOR THE WHOLE
HOUSE.

02:17.379 --> 02:22.862
LOOK AT THIS BUNCH OF LOSERS!

02:22.896 --> 02:29.137
ALL THIS RIGHT
NOW ON "BIG BROTHER"!

02:29.172 --> 02:32.034
YOU ALL BETTER BE NICE TO THE
H.O.H. UP THERE.

02:32.068 --> 02:36.655
MIGHT GO ON THE BLOCK.

02:40.206 --> 02:48.655
THIS NOMINATION CEREMONY IS
AJOURNED.

02:48.689 --> 02:52.034
I NOMINATED ALYSSA AND XAVIER.

02:52.068 --> 02:58.206
I KNOW THAT THE COOKOUT...

02:58.241 --> 03:03.034
WANTED TO TARGET CLAIRE, BUT
SINCE IT'S MY H.O.H., THERE'S NO

03:03.068 --> 03:05.206
WAY I'M NOMINATING CLAIRE THIS
WEEK.

03:05.241 --> 03:08.310
SO, ALYSSA, YOU ARE HEADING OUT
THAT DOOR.

03:08.344 --> 03:11.310
I'M REALLY NOT SHOCKED THAT
"X" AND I ARE ON THE BLOCK.

03:11.344 --> 03:12.827
IT'S THE OBVIOUS DECISION TO
MAKE.

03:12.862 --> 03:15.137
WE ARE A STRONG DUO IN THE
HOUSE.

03:15.172 --> 03:18.206
I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHERE
TIFFANY'S HEAD'S AT AS FAR AS

03:18.241 --> 03:21.241
WHO HER MAIN TARGET IS, BUT THIS
IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT

03:21.275 --> 03:23.517
VETO TO WIN AT THIS POINT IN MY
GAME.

03:23.551 --> 03:26.965
I AM ON THE BLOCK NEXT TO MY
NUMBER ONE, SO I JUST REALLY,

03:27.000 --> 03:30.689
REALLY NEED TO FOCUS AND GUN FOR
THIS VETO AS HARD AS I CAN.

03:30.724 --> 03:31.827
"X" YOU LOOK GOOD.

03:31.862 --> 03:33.310
YOU DO LOOK GOOD.

03:33.344 --> 03:35.241
THIS IS IDEAL.

03:35.275 --> 03:39.310
I'M SO HAPPY THAT ALYSSA AND "X"
ARE ON THE BLOCK, AND WE'RE

03:39.344 --> 03:41.862
FINALLY GOING TO SPLIT UP
ANOTHER DUO.

03:41.896 --> 03:44.758
AND I KNOW THAT I'M GOING TO BE
SAFE.

03:44.793 --> 03:48.206
THINGS COULD NOT BE BETTER RIGHT
NOW.

03:48.241 --> 03:49.896
WELL DONE.

03:49.931 --> 03:54.275
CLAIRE WAS THE COOKOUT'S
INTENDED TARGET FOR THIS WEEK.

03:54.310 --> 03:58.413
BUT TIFFANY TOOK IT UPON HERSELF
TO WIN H.O.H.

03:58.448 --> 04:02.379
SO HER SELFISH MOTIVATION HAS
RESULTED ME IN SEEING THE BLOCK

04:02.413 --> 04:06.310
FOR THE THIRD TIME IN A ROW WHEN
I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO SEE THE

04:06.344 --> 04:07.206
BLOCK THIS WEEK.

04:07.241 --> 04:09.310
A LITTLE FRUSTRATING.

04:09.344 --> 04:11.103
> WE'RE ALL ON THE BLOCK.

04:11.137 --> 04:13.931
WE'RE ALL ON THE BLOCK.

04:13.965 --> 04:16.310
LAST TWO, ARE ON THE BLOCK!

04:16.344 --> 04:21.517
OH, MY GOD!

04:21.551 --> 04:22.586
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

04:22.620 --> 04:26.241
UH-HUH.

04:26.275 --> 04:28.551
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AN EASY
WIN FOR US.

04:28.586 --> 04:29.724
YEAH.

04:29.758 --> 04:32.172
YOU GET HOUSEGUEST CHOICE,
WHO ARE YOU GOING TO PICK?

04:32.206 --> 04:34.586
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

04:34.620 --> 04:35.793
I'M NOT SURE.

04:35.827 --> 04:38.586
I THINK YOU SHOULD PICK
HANNAH.

04:38.620 --> 04:42.517
BUT HANNAH IS CLOSE WITH
TIFFANY.

04:42.551 --> 04:45.965
I DON'T THINK IT'S SMART TO PICK
SOMEONE THAT WILL USE IT ON US,

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE WILL.

04:48.034 --> 04:49.827
IF I'M PICKING HOUSEGUEST
CHOICE, I'M PICKING SOMEONE I

04:49.862 --> 04:55.758
THINK I COULD BEAT, SO I'LL
PROBABLY PICK BIG "D" OR AZAH.

04:55.793 --> 04:57.551
OKAY, TRUE.

04:57.586 --> 05:01.965
THE WAY I SEE IT, IF ONE OF
US DOESN'T WIN THE VETO, IT'S

05:02.000 --> 05:08.379
NOT LOOKING GOOD FOR THE BALD
BLACK MAN.

05:08.413 --> 05:09.655
SO...

05:09.689 --> 05:11.620
I'M MAKING ALYSSA THINK THAT I'M
THE TARGET THIS WEEK, JUST TO

05:11.655 --> 05:13.586
BETTER CONCEAL THE COOKOUT.

05:13.620 --> 05:15.241
BUT I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

05:15.275 --> 05:18.034
ALYSSA AND I SHOULDN'T BE ON THE
BLOCK THIS WEEK.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.689
IT SHOULD BE CLAIRE AND TIFFANY.

05:20.724 --> 05:24.103
NOW I NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO RECTIFY THE SITUATION SO THAT

05:24.137 --> 05:26.586
IT'S NOT ALYSSA AND I SITTING
NEXT TO EACH OTHER COME

05:26.620 --> 05:28.241
THURSDAY.

05:28.275 --> 05:29.586
I'M ON THE BLOCK.

05:29.620 --> 05:30.586
I'M FEELING RECKLESS.

05:30.620 --> 05:33.275
8 BALL CORNER POCKET.

05:33.310 --> 05:34.206
BOOM!

05:34.241 --> 05:36.448
SEE, AS YOU CAN SEE, AMERICA,

05:36.482 --> 05:46.034
I CAN'T WIN ANYTHING IN THIS
HOUSE.

05:46.068 --> 05:50.068
YOU DID GREAT ON YOUR SPEECH
TODAY.

05:50.103 --> 05:51.103
THANK YOU.

05:51.137 --> 05:53.965
DAMN, IF ALYSSA COMES DOWN...

05:54.000 --> 05:56.344
I DON'T WANT TO BE IN THE
POSITION WHERE I HAVE TO

05:56.379 --> 05:57.448
NOMINATE A THIRD PERSON.

05:57.482 --> 06:00.827
WHO WOULD I PUT UP?

06:00.862 --> 06:02.827
MY TARGET THIS WEEK IS ALYSSA.

06:02.862 --> 06:05.896
BUT IF SHE HAPPENS TO WIN VETO
THIS WEEK AND PULLS HERSELF OFF

06:05.931 --> 06:08.965
OF THE BLOCK, I AM GOING TO FIND
MYSELF IN A VERY TOUGH

06:09.000 --> 06:10.241
SITUATION.

06:10.275 --> 06:13.275
THE ONLY PERSON LEFT OUTSIDE OF
THE COOKOUT WOULD BE CLAIRE TO

06:13.310 --> 06:14.482
NOMINATE.

06:14.517 --> 06:18.068
SO I WOULD BE FORCED TO CHOOSE
BETWEEN MY PLUS-ONE AND THE

06:18.103 --> 06:19.275
COOKOUT.

06:19.310 --> 06:21.137
THIS IS A DECISION THAT I DON'T
WANT TO BE FORCED TO MAKE.

06:21.172 --> 06:24.724
SO ALYSSA BETTER NOT COME OFF OF
THAT BLOCK.

06:24.758 --> 06:27.965
I WANT YOU TO PLAY, IF YOU GET
CHOSEN TO PLAY.

06:28.000 --> 06:28.965
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO WIN.

06:29.000 --> 06:36.000
WE'VE GOT TO WIN, YEAH.

06:36.034 --> 06:38.827
HI.

06:38.862 --> 06:42.137
OKAY, IF I PICK YOU FOR VETO,
WOULD YOU COMPETE FOR ME

06:42.172 --> 06:43.931
I SAVED YOU.

06:43.965 --> 06:45.275
REMEMBER, I SAVED YOU.

06:45.310 --> 06:48.275
I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE DEREK OFF
THE BLOCK.

06:48.310 --> 06:49.482
THANK YOU!

06:49.517 --> 06:53.241
I DO FEEL PRETTY GOOD WITH MY
RELATIONSHIP WITH BIG "D,"

06:53.275 --> 06:56.793
MAINLY BECAUSE I DID SAVE BIG
"D" FROM BEING ON THE BLOCK FROM

06:56.827 --> 06:58.034
THE CHOPPING BLOCK ROULETTE.

06:58.068 --> 06:59.931
AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME, I
COULD USE AS MUCH HELP AS I CAN,

06:59.965 --> 07:02.034
SO IT'S TIME FOR ME TO COLLECT
SOME FAVORS.

07:02.068 --> 07:04.689
LISTEN, IF YOU PICK ME, OF
COURSE I'M GOING TO PLAY FOR

07:04.724 --> 07:05.172
YOU.

07:05.206 --> 07:07.965
OKAY.

07:08.000 --> 07:08.379
THANKS.

07:08.413 --> 07:09.068
ABSOLUTELY.

07:09.103 --> 07:10.172
YOU DID TAKE ME OFF THE BLOCK.

07:10.206 --> 07:11.172
I DID TAKE YOU OFF.

07:11.206 --> 07:12.965
SO I HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.689
I'M TELLING ALYSSA THAT I'M
GOING TO USE THE VETE ON ON HER

07:15.724 --> 07:16.896
IF I WIN.

07:16.931 --> 07:19.310
BUT, BABY GIRL, I LOVE YOU, BUT
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN

07:19.344 --> 07:22.068
BECAUSE I CAN'T AFFORD TIFFANY
POTENTIALLY PUTTING UP ANYONE

07:22.103 --> 07:23.379
ELSE IN THE COOKOUT.

07:23.413 --> 07:28.000
I JUST DON'T TRUST THAT TIFFANY
WILL DO WHAT NEEDS TO GET DONE.

07:28.034 --> 07:31.413
I'M NOT GOING TO REALLY
STRESS ABOUT IT.

07:31.448 --> 07:35.275
NOT GOING TO DO THE FAKE SMILE
THIS WEEK TO GET MY WAY THROUGH

07:35.310 --> 07:36.689
IT.

07:36.724 --> 07:38.965
I'D RATHER PREPARE MYSELF FOR A
VETO.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.379
I DON'T NEED TO BE ALL
BUDDY-BUDDY WITH PEOPLE.

07:41.413 --> 07:48.620
YEAH.

07:48.655 --> 07:56.689
LOOK AT YOUR FACE.

07:56.724 --> 08:00.620
AM WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

08:00.655 --> 08:02.137
IT'S AN INDIVIDUAL GAME.

08:02.172 --> 08:05.517
WE QUE THAT WHEN WE CAME IN
HERE.

08:05.551 --> 08:09.413
WE KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO
GET US TO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.

08:09.448 --> 08:13.655
SHE PISSED ME OFF THIS WEEK.

08:13.689 --> 08:18.172
I'VE BEEN THROWING COMPETITIONS.

08:18.206 --> 08:19.620
I'VE MADE SACRIFICES.

08:19.655 --> 08:20.689
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW.

08:20.724 --> 08:24.344
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WILL DO WITH
THE VETO IF I WIN.

08:24.379 --> 08:27.413
LET'S SAY I WIN THE VETO, TAKE
ALYSSA DOWN.

08:27.448 --> 08:29.379
THEN WHAT HAPPENS?

08:29.413 --> 08:31.275
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT
TO YOURSELF.

08:31.310 --> 08:35.068
WHY NOT?

08:35.103 --> 08:38.586
I'M GOING TO PLAY A SCENARIO
WITH YOU IN MY HEAD.

08:38.620 --> 08:42.034
THIS IS JUST IF I FELT LIKE
BEING A...

08:42.068 --> 08:43.758
WHICH I HAVEN'T BEEN.

08:43.793 --> 08:46.241
I'VE BEEN A TEAM-FIRST PLAYER.

08:46.275 --> 08:51.586
I WIN THE GOLDEN POWER OF VETO,
I SNATCH ALYSSA OFF.

08:51.620 --> 08:52.655
ALYSSA IS SAFE.

08:52.689 --> 08:55.413
SHE HAS A CHOICE TO PUT UP
CLAIRE, WHICH WOULD MAKE

08:55.448 --> 09:00.448
EVERYBODY IN THE COOKOUT HAPPY,
PRETTY MUCH RUIN HER GAME,

09:00.482 --> 09:03.413
BECAUSE SHE WOULD GO TO JURY AND
TELL EVERYONE TIFFANY PUT HER

09:03.448 --> 09:04.379
UP.

09:04.413 --> 09:09.620
OR SHE PUTS UP ANOTHER MEMBER OF
THE COOKOUT.

09:09.655 --> 09:11.758
WHICH ALSO RUINS HER GAME.

09:11.793 --> 09:17.862
THE SELF-INTEREST PLAY THAT I'M
SEEING MAKES ME WANT TO JUST...

09:17.896 --> 09:18.586
GAME OVER.

09:18.620 --> 09:20.758
I LOVE ME A MESSY-MESSY PLAN.

09:20.793 --> 09:24.655
I DON'T MIND EATING SOME POPCORN
AND WATCHING IT JUST EXPLODE.

09:24.689 --> 09:27.241
BUT IT'S ALSO SCARY BECAUSE
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TIFFANY

09:27.275 --> 09:27.896
HERE.

09:27.931 --> 09:29.379
SHE MIGHT NOT PUT CLAIRE UP.

09:29.413 --> 09:33.448
SHE MIGHT PUT ME OR KYLAND OR
AZAH.

09:33.482 --> 09:36.413
SHE CAN DECIDE ON WHOEVER SHE
WANTS TO PUT UP AT THAT POINT.

09:36.448 --> 09:40.068
AND THAT'S A RISKY MOVE FOR MY
GAME AND EVERYONE ELSE WHO I

09:40.103 --> 09:41.172
CARE ABOUT.

09:41.206 --> 09:43.758
I THINK MY KINDNESS IS BEING
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF.

09:43.793 --> 09:48.413
ARE WE AT THE POINT WHERE
WE'RE LIKE...

09:48.448 --> 09:50.344
THAT'S WHERE I'M AT RIGHT
NOW.

09:50.379 --> 09:51.620
WHY WOULD I DO THIS?

09:51.655 --> 09:53.206
TO PISS TIFFANY OFF.

09:53.241 --> 09:57.206
THE EVIL SIDE OF ME WANTS TO
COME OUT BECAUSE I'VE BEEN

09:57.241 --> 10:00.344
CAGING HIM ALL SUMMER LONG FOR
THIS DAMN COOKOUT.

10:00.379 --> 10:03.137
IF OTHER PEOPLE ARE GOING TO
PRIORITIZE THEIR OWN INTEREST

10:03.172 --> 10:06.793
OVER THAT OF THE COOKOUT, WHY
SHOULDN'T I BE DOING THE SAME?

10:06.827 --> 10:10.379
AND IF I'M GOING TO BE DOING THE
SAME, I'M GOING TO GO IT IN

10:10.413 --> 10:11.551
GLORIOUS FASHION.

10:11.586 --> 10:14.448
BUT FOR THIS IDEA TO BECOME A
REALITY, I HAVE TO WIN THE

10:14.482 --> 10:16.724
GOLDEN POWER OF VETO, WHICH
MEANS NO THROWING THIS

10:16.758 --> 10:17.620
COMPETITION.

10:17.655 --> 10:18.206
I'M COMING FOR THE GOLDEN POWER
OF VETO.

10:18.241 --> 10:19.793
WE HAVE TO BE SMART.

10:19.827 --> 10:24.827
IF WE'RE BOTH NOT LEVEL-HEADED,
IT COULD GO SOUTH.

10:24.862 --> 10:25.551
DON'T PLAY WITH ME.

10:35.068 --> 10:39.137
I'M GOING TO SAY REAL QUICK.

10:39.172 --> 10:41.517
GO AHEAD, DO WHAT YOU NEED TO
DO.

10:41.551 --> 10:47.172
DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

10:47.206 --> 10:53.517
♪ DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
I SING AT HOME ALL THE TIME, AND

10:53.551 --> 10:56.620

23:36.620 --> 23:41.827
EITHER I WANT TO WIN THE

23:41.862 --> 23:46.206
VETO, OR I WANT ALYSSA TO WIN
THE VETO, BECAUSE I COULD TAKE

23:46.241 --> 23:49.793
ALYSSA OFF THE BLOCK AND FORCE
TIFFANY TO CHOOSE BETWEEN

23:49.827 --> 23:55.344
NOMINATING CLAIRE OR A COOKOUT
MEMBER.

23:55.379 --> 23:59.241
IF SOMEONE COMES OFF THE
BLOCK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT

23:59.275 --> 24:01.000
SHENANIGANS TIFFANY IS GOING TO
TRY TO PULL.

24:01.034 --> 24:05.103
SO I NEED TO WIN THIS VETO, SO I
CAN MAKE SURE NOMINATIONS STAY

24:05.137 --> 24:13.758
THE SAME.

24:13.793 --> 24:19.310
I HAVE TO WIN THIS VETO FOR
TWO REASONS.

24:19.344 --> 24:22.551
ONE, I WANT TO CONTINUE TO BUILD
MY RESUME IN THIS GAME.

24:22.586 --> 24:23.827
AND, TWO, ALYSSA CANNOT WIN.

24:23.862 --> 24:28.206
I NEED TO WIN, KEEP NOMINATIONS
THE SAME, SO THAT WE CAN SEND

24:28.241 --> 24:30.965
ALYSSA HOME.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.517
CHADDHA IS STARTING HER THIRD
ROW.

24:33.551 --> 24:34.275
AMAZING.

24:34.310 --> 24:38.103
OH, MY GOSH

24:38.137 --> 24:47.034
IF I WIN THIS VETO, I CAN

24:47.068 --> 24:49.862
EITHER TAKE XAVIER DOWN OR KEEP
THE NOMINATION THE SAME.

24:49.896 --> 24:51.620
EITHER WAY IS GOOD FOR ME.

24:51.655 --> 24:55.689
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE CAN
STILL GET ALYSSA OUT THIS WEEK.

25:07.068 --> 25:11.344
ALYSSA IS ON THE THIRD ROW!

25:11.379 --> 25:12.275
TIFF IS MOVING.

25:12.310 --> 25:12.965
LOOK AT THAT.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.965
SHE IS.

25:16.000 --> 25:24.965
OH, TIFFANY IS KNOCKING HERS

25:25.000 --> 25:26.689
OFF.

25:26.724 --> 25:30.034
ALYSSA'S GOING!

25:30.068 --> 25:31.482
WOW.

25:31.517 --> 25:34.275
OH, MY GOSH, ALYSSA MIGHT
JUST WIN THIS.

25:34.310 --> 25:35.896
NO, ALYSSA IS ABOUT TO WIN
THIS.

25:35.931 --> 25:38.862
I'M STACKING HIGHER AND
HIGHER, AND I'M FEELING PRETTY

25:38.896 --> 25:40.137
CONFIDENT.

25:40.172 --> 25:45.931
MAYBE I COULD GET IT ON MY FIRST
TRY, AND THAT WOULD BE INSANE.

25:45.965 --> 25:47.482
OH!

25:47.517 --> 25:48.931
NO!

25:48.965 --> 25:50.655
WHOA!

25:50.689 --> 25:53.413
HEARTBREAKING FOR HER, BUT LET'S

25:53.448 --> 25:53.689
GO.

25:53.724 --> 25:54.310
OH!

25:54.344 --> 25:55.344
THIS SUCKS.

25:55.379 --> 26:01.000
NOW I HAVE TO BUILD THE PYRAMID
ALL OVER AGAIN.

26:01.034 --> 26:04.448
I'M A PHLEBOTOMIST, AND I'M
GOOD AT IT.

26:04.482 --> 26:06.551
I'VE GOT THE STEADIEST HAND I
KNOW.

26:06.586 --> 26:08.103
HOWEVER, THEY JUST KEEP FALLING!

26:08.137 --> 26:13.137
THIS IS LITERALLY ANYONE'S
COMP.

26:13.172 --> 26:18.068
I ONLY HAVE ONE MORE

26:18.103 --> 26:21.482
MICRO-COCKTAIL THAT I HAVE TO
PUT ON TOP.

26:21.517 --> 26:21.965
NO!

26:22.000 --> 26:24.551
OH!

26:24.586 --> 26:25.482
HEARTBREAK.

26:25.517 --> 26:27.862
I HIT THE BAR AND KNOCK
EVERYTHING OVER.

26:27.896 --> 26:29.896
AND I'M JUST PISSED.

26:29.931 --> 26:31.862
DEREK, DON'T GIVE UP.

26:31.896 --> 26:32.344
RESTART.

26:32.379 --> 26:33.931
BACK IN THE GAME.

26:33.965 --> 26:36.310
THIS THING KEEPS FALLING AND
FALLING AND FALLING.

26:36.344 --> 26:40.655
AND I'M MAD BECAUSE I CAN'T EVEN
DRINK THE DAMN COCKTAILS.

26:40.689 --> 26:43.034
THIS IS NOT A COMPETITION FOR A
GUY WITH BIG HANDS.

26:43.068 --> 26:47.275
AND YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT THEY SAY
ABOUT BIG HANDS...

26:47.310 --> 26:50.000
THEY KNOCK OVER THE
MICRO-COCKTAILS.

26:50.034 --> 26:52.655
I'M GIVING IT MY BEST SHOT,
BUT IT'S NOT REALLY WORKING OUT.

26:52.689 --> 26:55.482
IT LOOKS LIKE A COLLEGE FRAT
PARTY.

26:55.517 --> 26:57.344
THERE ARE COCKTAILS EVERYWHERE.

26:57.379 --> 27:00.000
WHEN THINGS ARE GOING SO
TERRIBLY, YOU CAN'T REALLY DO

27:00.034 --> 27:03.310
ANYTHING ELSE BUT LAUGH.

27:03.344 --> 27:08.586
I FEEL LIKE I CAN'T WATCH.

27:08.620 --> 27:13.827
IT'S LOOKING LIKE MY STRATEGY

27:13.862 --> 27:18.689
OF KEEPING A STRONG BASE IS
WORKING.

27:18.724 --> 27:19.103
OH!

27:19.137 --> 27:20.379
OH, MY GOD!

27:20.413 --> 27:22.275
DUDE, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

27:22.310 --> 27:28.275
BUT EVERY TIME MIPYRAMID
FALLS, I SEE IT'S MAKING MY BASE

27:28.310 --> 27:29.586
VERY UNSTABLE.

27:29.620 --> 27:32.206
I'M REALIZING THAT EVEN IF A FEW
OF MY GLASSES DO FALL, I'M JUST

27:32.241 --> 27:35.344
GOING TO KNOCK THE REST OVER AND
START FROM SCRATCH

27:35.379 --> 27:43.551
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE A

27:43.586 --> 27:44.758
SURGEON.

27:44.793 --> 27:46.689
BUT THE FACT THAT I CAN'T HOLD
THESE WEEZERS STILL TELLS ME

27:46.724 --> 27:50.344
THAT I HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER
CAREER BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY.

27:50.379 --> 27:56.896
OH!

27:56.931 --> 28:00.344
-- OH, MY GOD 1
- KWR50
- EURBGS OH,

28:00.379 --> 28:00.965
MY GOD!

28:01.000 --> 28:02.275
I'M FEELING SO ANNOYED.

28:02.310 --> 28:05.241
EVERY TIME I GET SO CLOSE,
SOMEHOW IT FALLS.

28:05.275 --> 28:08.068
BUT I'M GETTING MORE PRACTICE
EVERY TIME, AND I JUST CANNOT

28:08.103 --> 28:09.172
GET DISCOURAGED.

28:09.206 --> 28:13.965
I NEED TO FOCUS AND I NEED TO
WIN THIS COMPETITION.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.931
ARE

28:18.965 --> 28:30.344
I AM ALMOST THERE, JUST A FEW

28:30.379 --> 28:31.034
MORE GLASSES.

28:31.068 --> 28:36.689
TIFF, YOU'VE GOT THIS.

28:36.724 --> 28:39.862
I AM SO CLOSE AGAIN, I AM
PLAYSER FOCUSED.

28:39.896 --> 28:42.034
MY B.B. LIFE IS ON THE LINE.

28:42.068 --> 28:47.517
LOSING IS JUST NOT AN OPTION AT
THIS POINT.

28:47.551 --> 28:49.068
OH, MY GOD!

28:49.103 --> 28:53.241
THIS IS WILD!

28:53.275 --> 28:58.793
NO!

28:58.827 --> 29:03.000
YES!

29:03.034 --> 29:05.551
DAMN!

29:05.586 --> 29:07.551
OH, MY GOD!

29:07.586 --> 29:08.586
THANK YOU!

29:08.620 --> 29:11.068
GOOD JOB, BABY.

29:11.103 --> 29:13.034
CONGRATULATIONS, ALYSSA!

29:13.068 --> 29:17.172
YOU HAVE WON THE GOLDEN POWER OF
VETO!

29:17.206 --> 29:19.965
I JUST WON THE GOLDEN POWER
OF VETO!

29:20.000 --> 29:23.793
I AM SO EXCITED BECAUSE I KILLED
IT!

29:23.827 --> 29:25.724
AND NOW I'M SAFE THIS WEEK.

29:25.758 --> 29:27.379
OH, MY GOD.

29:27.413 --> 29:28.620
THANK GOD.

29:28.655 --> 29:36.482
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN BRING
THESE MORONS BACK INTO THE YARD.

29:36.517 --> 29:39.344
YAY!

29:39.379 --> 29:39.965
<i>[ APPLAUSE ].</i>

29:40.000 --> 29:40.586
CONGRATULATIONS ALYSSA.

29:40.620 --> 29:42.827
DOUBLE HUG, DOUBLE HUG.

29:42.862 --> 29:48.034
THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST
PREDICAMENT FOR ME TO BE IN.

29:48.068 --> 29:51.517
OH, THIS, I...

29:51.551 --> 29:52.448
I... AH!

29:52.482 --> 29:55.275
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET, TIFFANY

29:55.310 --> 29:59.586
AND I E DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO WIN
THE GOLDEN POWER OF VETO.

29:59.620 --> 30:00.793
ALYSSA WON.

30:00.827 --> 30:02.758
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU DIDN'T
WANT.

30:02.793 --> 30:03.482
AND GUESS WHAT?

30:03.517 --> 30:04.000
IT HAPPENED.

30:04.034 --> 30:05.965
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.103
THANKS, ALYSSA, FOR HELPING
ME GO VIRAL.

30:09.137 --> 30:10.655
OH, YOU'RE WELCOME, ZINGBOT.

30:10.689 --> 30:12.965
I'M OUT OF HERE.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.586
BYE, MORONS!

30:14.620 --> 30:16.310
BYE, LOSER!

30:16.344 --> 30:16.793
BYE!

30:16.827 --> 30:19.482
LOVE YOU, ZING!

30:19.517 --> 30:20.551
ZIIIING!

30:32.482 --> 30:34.068
HEY.

30:34.103 --> 30:36.000
WHAT'S GOING ON?

30:36.034 --> 30:38.413
I'M JUST BUMMED I DIDN'T WIN.

30:38.448 --> 30:39.413
I CAN'T WIN IN THIS HOUSE.

30:39.448 --> 30:42.034
I'M STILL ON THE BLOCK, AND
YOU'RE BUMMED?

30:42.068 --> 30:43.689
I COULD END UP NEXT TO YOU.

30:43.724 --> 30:44.931
YEAH, RIGHT.

30:44.965 --> 30:47.034
IF WE WOULD HAVE WENT WITH
OUR ORIGINAL PLAN, WE WOULDN'T

30:47.068 --> 30:48.413
BE WORRIED ABOUT THIS.

30:48.448 --> 30:49.482
WELCOME TO "BIG BROTHER."

30:49.517 --> 30:53.034
NO, THIS AIN'T EVEN "BIG
BROTHER."

30:53.068 --> 30:55.655
THAT WAS JUST A WOMAN BEING
SELFISH, AND NOW IT BIT HER IN

30:55.689 --> 30:56.344
THE ASS.

30:56.379 --> 30:58.344
WE BETTER HOPE SHE DOES IT.

30:58.379 --> 31:01.172
ALYSSA WINNING VETO MAKES ME
VERY NERVOUS BECAUSE I DON'T

31:01.206 --> 31:02.862
KNOW WHAT TIFFANY'S GOING TO DO
NOW.

31:02.896 --> 31:07.034
THE PLAN IS FOR HER TO PUT
CLAIRE ON THE BLOCK, BUT KNOWING

31:07.068 --> 31:09.689
TIFFANY, SHE CAN ALWAYS BE
SELFISH ONCE AGAIN AND DECIDE TO

31:09.724 --> 31:15.379
MAKE A BIG MOVE BY PUTTING THE
BOYS IN THE COOKOUT ON THE

31:15.413 --> 31:16.034
BLOCK.

31:16.068 --> 31:17.344
AND SENDING ONE OF US HOME.

31:17.379 --> 31:25.034
THE WAY I SEE IT, IS SHE HAS
SHE PUTS UP CLAIRE.

31:25.068 --> 31:30.379
IF SHE PUTS UP ANOTHER MEMBER OF
THE COOKOUT...

31:30.413 --> 31:34.655
AND SHE MAKES IT TO FINAL TWO,
SHE JUST LOST FOUR VOTES.

31:34.689 --> 31:35.689
I KNOW.

31:35.724 --> 31:38.000
IT'S JUST A LOT OF PRESSURE
BECAUSE IT'S, LIKE--

31:38.034 --> 31:39.034
A LOT OF POSSIBILITIES.

31:39.068 --> 31:45.068
RIGHT.

31:45.103 --> 31:50.931
I AM NOT SURPRISED ALYSSA WON
THE VETO.

31:50.965 --> 31:52.896
MURPHY'S LAW IS THE STORY OF MY
LIFE.

31:52.931 --> 31:54.034
UH-HUH.

31:54.068 --> 32:00.551
AND NOW PEOPLE FEEL LIKE,
"THAT'S WHAT SHE DESERVES.

32:00.586 --> 32:03.344
THAT'S WHAT SHE GETS.

32:03.379 --> 32:06.758
SHE WANTED H.O.H., SO SHE SHOULD
HAVE TO SUFFER THE

32:06.793 --> 32:07.137
CONSEQUENCES."

32:07.172 --> 32:08.275
YEAH.

32:08.310 --> 32:10.689
NOBODY WANTS ME TO HAVE WHAT
I WANT AT THIS POINT.

32:10.724 --> 32:12.275
AND IF CLAIRE HAS TO GO, CLAIRE
HAS TO GO.

32:12.310 --> 32:15.862
I JUST HAVE TO TELL CLAIRE.

32:15.896 --> 32:22.068
WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE COOKOUT
AND CLAIRE, FOR MY OWN PERSONAL

32:22.103 --> 32:23.724
GAME, IT WOULD BE CLAIRE ALL
DAY.

32:23.758 --> 32:26.655
BUT I MADE A COMMITMENT TO THE
COOKOUT, AND IF I GO AGAINST

32:26.689 --> 32:30.034
THEM NOW, MY CHANCES OF WINNING
THIS GAME ARE SHOT.

32:30.068 --> 32:35.275
I HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO BREAK IT
TO HER THAT SHE IS GOING TO BE

32:35.310 --> 32:40.310
THE REPLACEMENT NOMINEE WITHOUT
RUINING MY RELATIONSHIP WITH

32:40.344 --> 32:41.586
CLAIRE.

32:41.620 --> 32:49.655
YOU COULD FRAME IT LIKE, "I
MADE A DEAL WITH XAVIER, KYLAND,

32:49.689 --> 32:59.034
AZAH AND BIG "D" THIS WEEK THEY
WOULDN'T SEND ANY OF THEM HOME."

32:59.068 --> 33:01.310
YOU DON'T TELL CLAIRE ABOUT
THE COOKOUT.

33:01.344 --> 33:02.172
OKAY.

33:02.206 --> 33:04.379
WHEN IS WHY THE WORD "DEAL" IS
PERFECT.

33:04.413 --> 33:09.517
WHAT I DON'T WANT IS TO
COMPLETELY MISLEAD HER.

33:09.551 --> 33:13.551
AND I ALSO DON'T WANT TO
ENDANGER ANYBODY ELSE.

33:13.586 --> 33:17.068
YEAH.

33:17.103 --> 33:21.551
UH-HUH.

33:25.413 --> 33:29.586
IF SHE PUTS UP SOMEBODY ELSE
IN THE COOKOUT, SHE BETTER MAKE

33:29.620 --> 33:31.724
SURE I'M NOT HERE ANYMORE.

33:31.758 --> 33:33.517
THAT'S HOW I FEEL.

33:33.551 --> 33:35.586
ARE YOU CONSPIRING AGAINST
ME?

33:35.620 --> 33:36.034
PROBABLY.

33:36.068 --> 33:37.482
I DON'T KNOW.

33:37.517 --> 33:39.000
HOW IS SHE-- IS SHE OKAY?

33:39.034 --> 33:41.655
YEAH, TIFF'S FINE.

33:41.689 --> 33:45.344
CLAIRE HAS TO GO UP.

33:45.379 --> 33:48.206
AND--
SO HOW IS SHE TRYING TO FRAME

33:48.241 --> 33:49.413
THAT?

33:49.448 --> 33:53.310
WELL, OBVIOUSLY, SHE CAN'T
EXPOSE THE COOKE UP ON THE.

33:53.344 --> 33:59.034
SO SHE CAN FRAME IT AS, "THIS
WEEK, I MADE A DEAL WITH XAVIER,

33:59.068 --> 34:03.344
BIG "D," AZAH, CHADDHA, AND
KYLAND."

34:03.379 --> 34:06.137
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT ONE.

34:06.172 --> 34:09.620
I THINK EVEN IF SHE SAYS SHE
MAKES THAT DEAL...

34:09.655 --> 34:10.344
YEAH.

34:10.379 --> 34:11.413
THAT DOES EXPOSE US.

34:11.448 --> 34:14.413
SHE HAS TO THINK ABOUT HER
OWN MANAGEMENT HERE.

34:14.448 --> 34:15.344
OF COURSE.

34:15.379 --> 34:18.448
SHE ISN'T THINK ABOUT THE
SIX.

34:18.482 --> 34:19.793
IT'S NOT THAT.

34:19.827 --> 34:22.379
IT'S WHO SHE'S SAYING SHE MADE
THE DEAL WITH.

34:22.413 --> 34:23.758
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

34:23.793 --> 34:25.034
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE IN
THE COOKOUT.

34:25.068 --> 34:30.482
I KNOW, BUT CLAIRE MIGHT
RESPECT IT MORE IF TIFF IS

34:30.517 --> 34:33.551
HONEST WITH HER NOW, VERSUS
AFTER SHE SEND HER PACKING.

34:33.586 --> 34:37.482
IF SHE DOES THAT, NEARLY
EVERYONE IN THE COOKOUT WILL

34:37.517 --> 34:39.068
WANT TO COME AFTER HER.

34:39.103 --> 34:41.896
NOT ONLY ARE YOU BLOWING UP
EVERYTHING IN THIS HOUSE,

34:41.931 --> 34:43.137
AMERICA SEES IS,s TOO.

34:43.172 --> 34:44.448
YOU DON'T WANT THAT.

34:44.482 --> 34:44.758
I'M GLAD TIFFANY IS GOING TO BE
NAMING CLAIRE AS THE REPLACEMENT

34:44.793 --> 34:46.000
NOMINEE.

34:46.034 --> 34:48.448
BUT I'M SLIGHTLY CONCERNED ABOUT
HOW SHE'S PLANNING ON GOING

34:48.482 --> 34:49.862
ABOUT IT.

34:49.896 --> 34:52.655
IF TIFFANY ISN'T CAREFUL AND
PRECISE, WE RUN THE RISK OF

34:52.689 --> 34:55.241
EXPOSING THE COOKOUT WITH ALYSSA
STILL HERE, WHEN ALYSSA CAN

34:55.275 --> 34:57.655
STILL COMPETE IN THE NEXT H.O.H.

34:57.689 --> 35:02.137
WHO DO YOU THINK ALYSSA IS GOING
TO BE MOST UPSET WITH AND

35:02.172 --> 35:02.965
TARGET, ME?

35:03.000 --> 35:05.758
EXPOSING THE COOKOUT, NOT AN
OPTION.

35:05.793 --> 35:06.413
LIKE, THERE ARE JUST THINGS THAT
AREN'T AN OPTION.

35:21.793 --> 35:27.413
OH, GOD, CLAIRE.

35:27.448 --> 35:30.689
OF COURSE SHE'S GOING TO USE THE
VETE ON ON HERSELF.

35:30.724 --> 35:33.103
YEAH.

35:33.137 --> 35:35.758
SO I'M STRUGGLING.

35:35.793 --> 35:40.103
CLAIRE HAS MY UTMOST RESPECT, SO
I AM GOING TO BE AS HONEST WITH

35:40.137 --> 35:44.620
CLAIRE AS I CAN WITHOUT EXPOSING
THE COOKOUT.

35:44.655 --> 35:49.379
I STILL WANT HER RESPECT FOR ME,
AND I DON'T HAVE TO JEOPARDIZE

35:49.413 --> 35:53.068
THEIR GAME TO BE HONEST WITH MY
FRIEND.

35:53.103 --> 35:58.310
MY TARGET THIS WEEK...

35:58.344 --> 35:59.379
WAS ALYSSA.

35:59.413 --> 36:00.724
YEAH.

36:00.758 --> 36:06.344
BUT GAME ASIDE, MY OWN
PERSONAL PREFERENCE, I DON'T

36:06.379 --> 36:14.931
WANT TO BE THE PERSON TO SEND
OUT AZAH, CHADDHA, "X," KYLAND,

36:14.965 --> 36:15.896
BIG "D."

36:15.931 --> 36:18.482
I DON'T WANT TO SIT THEM NEXT TO
EACH OTHER.

36:18.517 --> 36:19.793
YEAH.

36:19.827 --> 36:23.827
AND BE THE ONE THAT HAS TO BE
THE FIRST PERSON TO SEND ONE OF

36:23.862 --> 36:24.206
THEM OUT.

36:24.241 --> 36:25.482
YEAH.

36:25.517 --> 36:29.103
AS MUCH AS I WANTED TO RIDE
THIS THING OUT WITH YOU, I DON'T

36:29.137 --> 36:32.137
HAVE ANYBODY ELSE TO PUT ON THE
BLOCK.

36:32.172 --> 36:37.310
YOU'RE GOING TO PUT ME UP?

36:37.344 --> 36:47.241
I HAVE TO PUT YOU UP.

36:47.275 --> 36:54.448
TIFF, THEY'RE JUST GOING TO
VOTE ME OUT.

36:54.482 --> 36:59.896
I LOVE YOU TO DEATH.

36:59.931 --> 37:06.724
I HAVE BEEN SO TORN YESTERDAY
AND TODAY.

37:06.758 --> 37:10.310
I NEVER WANTED TO BE THE ONE TO
PUT YOU IN THIS SITUATION TO GO

37:10.344 --> 37:11.344
ON THE BLOCK.

37:11.379 --> 37:15.034
YOU HAVE BEEN WITH ME SINCE THE
VERY BEGINNING.

37:15.068 --> 37:18.172
GAME ASIDE, I KNEW WHEN I CAME
INTO THIS HOUSE THAT I DIDN'T

37:18.206 --> 37:20.310
WANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR
SENDING ANY OF THEM HOME.

37:20.344 --> 37:26.310
BUT IF I PUT ANY OF THEM NEXT TO
HIM, I HAVE SEALED SOMEBODY'S

37:26.344 --> 37:27.517
FATE.

37:27.551 --> 37:29.689
AND WHEN THIS GAME IS OVER AND
THIS GAME IS DONE, I HAVE TO

37:29.724 --> 37:33.793
STILL BE ABLE TO LOOK APT MYSELF
AND BE CONFIDENT AND COMFORTABLE

37:33.827 --> 37:35.172
IN THE WAY I PLAYED THIS GAME.

37:35.206 --> 37:40.620
I CARE ABOUT YOU PROBABLY MORE
THAN ANYBODY IN THIS HOUSE.

37:40.655 --> 37:41.103
YEAH.

37:41.137 --> 37:42.241
I BELIEVE THAT.

37:42.275 --> 37:44.413
I DON'T WANT TO LIE TO YOU.

37:44.448 --> 37:49.551
I WANT TO BE AS HONEST WITH YOU
AS I CAN.

37:49.586 --> 37:53.103
ARE YOU IN AN ALLIANCE WITH
THEM?

37:53.137 --> 37:54.689
NO.

37:54.724 --> 38:05.137
WE-- I-- I HAVE MY OWN PERSONAL
FEELINGS ABOUT HOW I WANT TO

38:05.172 --> 38:06.724
PLAY THIS GAME.

38:06.758 --> 38:11.241
I'M SO SORRY.

38:11.275 --> 38:11.896
I'M SORRY.

38:11.931 --> 38:14.655
SO SORRY.

38:14.689 --> 38:18.724
IT REALLY, REALLY SUCKS,
BECAUSE I CAN'T BE THAT MAD AT

38:18.758 --> 38:20.103
HER.

38:20.137 --> 38:26.103
BECAUSE I KNOW... THAT TIFF
DOESN'T WANT TO BE PART OF THIS

38:26.137 --> 38:28.965
LONG TRADITION THAT'S HAPPENED
IN "BIG BROTHER," WHERE PEOPLE

38:29.000 --> 38:33.137
OF COLOR AND PEOPLE WHO ARE
BLACK GO OUT.

38:33.172 --> 38:35.896
AND THEY'RE PUT AGAINST EACH
OTHER AND THEY'RE SENT OUT.

38:35.931 --> 38:38.275
I KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE WON'T GET
IT.

38:38.310 --> 38:41.000
BUT I GET IT.

38:41.034 --> 38:52.344
AND THAT'S WHY I CAN'T FIGHT HER
ON THIS.

38:52.379 --> 38:57.103
THIS IS THE HARDEST DECISION
I HAVE EVER HAD TO MAKE IN THIS

38:57.137 --> 38:58.068
GAME.

38:58.103 --> 39:00.758
YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT YOU HAVE
TO DO, TIFF.

39:00.793 --> 39:02.172
I'M SORRY.

39:02.206 --> 39:08.206
AND EVEN IF I GO THIS WEEK, I
WON'T HOLD IT AGAINST YOU.

39:08.241 --> 39:10.551
I HAVE SO MUCH RESPECT FOR
YOU.

39:10.586 --> 39:12.689
I HAVE SO MUCH RESPECT FOR
YOU, TIFF.

39:12.724 --> 39:15.413
I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU GO
HOME THURSDAY.

39:15.448 --> 39:16.689
I HOPE YOU FIGHT.

39:16.724 --> 39:17.827
I WILL.

39:17.862 --> 39:19.206
COME OUT GUNS BLAZING.

39:19.241 --> 39:19.896
I WILL.

39:19.931 --> 39:25.068
YOU HAVE ME IN YOUR CORNER.

39:25.103 --> 39:26.310
I KNOW.

39:26.344 --> 39:27.931
I KNOW I DO.

39:27.965 --> 39:28.931
I'M STILL GOING TO FIGHT.

39:28.965 --> 39:30.275
AND THERE MIGHT BE A CHANCE.

39:57.620 --> 40:08.655
IT'S TIME FOR THE VETO MEETING.

40:08.689 --> 40:11.896
THIS IS THE VETO MEETING.

40:11.931 --> 40:14.896
XAVIER AND MYSELF HAVE BEEN
NOMINATED FOR EVICTION.

40:14.931 --> 40:19.620
BUT I HAVE THE POWER TO VETO ONE
OF THE NOMINATIONS.

40:19.655 --> 40:25.448
I HAVE DECIDED TO USE THE POWER
OF VETO ON MYSELF.

40:25.482 --> 40:30.137
TIFFANY, SINCE I JUST VETOED ONE
OF YOUR NOMINATIONS FOR

40:30.172 --> 40:33.482
EVICTION, YOU WILL NOW HAVE TO
NAME A NEW HOUSEGUEST AS A

40:33.517 --> 40:36.310
REPLACEMENT NOMINEE.

40:36.344 --> 40:43.275
THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT
DECISION.

40:43.310 --> 40:51.586
HOWEVER, CLAIRE, I AM CHOOSING
TO REPLACE MY NOMINATION WITH

40:51.620 --> 41:02.689
YOU.

41:02.724 --> 41:10.068
THIS VETO MEETING IS
ADJOURNED.

41:10.103 --> 41:13.689
I AM SO PROUD OF MYSELF THAT
I WON THE VETO AND GOT MYSELF

41:13.724 --> 41:16.379
OFF THE BLOCK, AND I WANT TO
KEEP UP THIS MOMENTUM AND BE

41:16.413 --> 41:19.517
ABLE TO WIN THE NEXT H.O.H., AND
I'M SORRY, TIFFANY, YOU SHOULD

41:19.551 --> 41:21.862
BE A LITTLE SCARED.

41:21.896 --> 41:28.689
I WANTED TO KEEP CLAIRE SAFE
AND REMAIN LOYAL TO THE COOKOUT.

41:28.724 --> 41:32.034
BUT WE CANNOT ALWAYS GET WHAT WE
WANT.

41:32.068 --> 41:36.413
NOT EVEN ME.

41:36.448 --> 41:40.862
I MAY HAVE GONE ON THE BLOCK
LIKE A LAMB, BUT I'M GOING TO GO

41:40.896 --> 41:42.862
UP ON THE LIKE A LION.

41:42.896 --> 41:46.241
AND I'LL GO OUT FIGHTING AND
SCRATCHING AND CLAWING AND DOING

41:46.275 --> 41:49.241
WHAT I NEED TO STAY.

41:49.275 --> 41:51.862
YOU'VE BEEN
WAITING ALL SUMMER, AND IT'S

41:51.896 --> 41:54.034
FINALLY HERE-- DOUBLE EVICTION.

41:54.068 --> 41:56.137
WILL THE COOKOUT COMPLETE THEIR
MISSION AND MAKE IT TO THE FINAL

41:56.172 --> 41:57.413
SIX?

41:57.448 --> 42:02.241
FIND OUT TOMORROW NIGHT AT 8:00,
7:00 CENTRAL ON "BIG BROTHER"!
