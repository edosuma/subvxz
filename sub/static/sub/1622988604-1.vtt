00:00.829 --> 00:04.078
(somber western music)

01:31.444 --> 01:32.402
(bell ringing)

01:32.402 --> 01:35.735
(tense rhythmic music)

01:39.383 --> 01:42.550
(tense western music)

02:17.234 --> 02:21.151
(tense rhythmic western music)

02:32.062 --> 02:34.236
(guns firing)

02:34.236 --> 02:36.022
(birds chirping)

02:36.022 --> 02:39.355
(somber western music)

02:44.346 --> 02:46.763
(Tate sighs)

03:20.680 --> 03:22.653
- Tate, don't leave town.

03:24.130 --> 03:25.600
- Will do, Sheriff.

03:25.600 --> 03:28.143
I'll just be in the cafe
getting something to eat.

03:28.143 --> 03:30.283
- Just don't leave town till I say so.

03:38.900 --> 03:42.063
Some of you carry him over to
the jail cell to bleed out.

03:42.063 --> 03:45.230
(juice harp twanging)

03:52.677 --> 03:55.844
(lighthearted music)

04:06.400 --> 04:09.150
- We have beef stew or
chicken and noodles.

04:09.150 --> 04:10.860
- Beef and biscuits?

04:10.860 --> 04:11.693
- Coffee?

04:11.693 --> 04:12.526
- Yeah.

04:13.580 --> 04:16.700
- Hey, I know who you are.

04:16.700 --> 04:19.360
You're the one who just killed The Kid.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.733
Killing didn't seem to
ruin your appetite none.

04:22.810 --> 04:26.283
I guess you do a lot of
that, don't you, Tate Butler?

04:27.730 --> 04:30.195
- Don't bother my customers, Wilson.

04:30.195 --> 04:32.050
(Wilson chuckles)
You might scare him off.

04:32.050 --> 04:35.050
- Gunfighters don't get
scared off by nothing,

04:35.050 --> 04:36.880
do they, Tate Butler?

04:36.880 --> 04:38.703
Yeah, yeah, you're a tough guy.

04:41.640 --> 04:42.721
- You don't have to talk to him

04:42.721 --> 04:44.171
if you don't want to, mister.

04:45.070 --> 04:48.129
He's just a nosy old gossip.

04:48.129 --> 04:49.930
- Now, that's not a nice thing to say

04:49.930 --> 04:51.730
about one of your regular customers.

04:52.690 --> 04:56.877
- [Tate] That's all
right, miss. Thank you.

04:56.877 --> 04:58.780
- You got nice manners.

04:58.780 --> 05:00.570
You from back East?

05:00.570 --> 05:02.118
- Indiana.

05:02.118 --> 05:05.750
- (chuckles) They don't got
no gunfighters in Indiana.

05:05.750 --> 05:07.750
Is that why you out here.

05:07.750 --> 05:10.550
- I'm out here for the same
reason everybody else is.

05:10.550 --> 05:11.383
- Gold?

05:13.560 --> 05:14.473
- Adventure.

05:15.375 --> 05:19.110
- Adventure? Well, you got
lots of that, didn't you?

05:19.110 --> 05:22.332
It's a real adventure when
everybody's trying to kill ya.

05:23.860 --> 05:28.860
(lighthearted music)
(Wilson laughing)

05:37.409 --> 05:40.903
- Katherine, I saw you out there earlier.

05:42.140 --> 05:44.890
You can't protect him
from behind a barrel.

05:44.890 --> 05:46.593
And even if you could this time,

05:47.430 --> 05:49.070
there's always gonna be another gunfighter

05:49.070 --> 05:50.290
trying to kill him.

05:50.290 --> 05:51.790
- So?

05:51.790 --> 05:54.130
- Stay away from Tate.

05:54.130 --> 05:55.659
He's no good.

05:55.659 --> 05:58.403
- I'm a grown woman and
I'll do what I want.

05:59.790 --> 06:04.050
- I can't just stand by and
watch you make a mistake.

06:04.050 --> 06:07.060
How could a father just let
his only daughter get hurt

06:07.060 --> 06:08.190
without saying something?

06:08.190 --> 06:10.713
- (scoffs) Well, you said
your piece now leave.

06:11.730 --> 06:15.420
You lost the right to be
my father a long time ago

06:15.420 --> 06:16.943
when you left my mother.

06:24.412 --> 06:26.950
- (sighs) You won't be Tate Butler's wife.

06:26.950 --> 06:27.950
You'll be his widow.

06:33.970 --> 06:36.520
- I hate to admit it, Katie dear,

06:36.520 --> 06:37.813
but he might be right.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.300
- [Waitress] Coffee, Sheriff?

06:49.300 --> 06:51.377
- That would be lovely, darlin'.

06:55.423 --> 06:57.150
- [Waitress] Pie?

06:57.150 --> 06:59.070
- That does look good.

06:59.070 --> 07:00.170
You talked me into it.

07:02.310 --> 07:04.130
- He shot first.

07:04.130 --> 07:06.620
- I know. You're safe.

07:06.620 --> 07:10.240
The Kid had a $200 bounty
on his head, dead or alive

07:10.240 --> 07:12.460
so you'll be collecting some money.

07:12.460 --> 07:14.350
- Oh, that's lucky.

07:14.350 --> 07:16.200
- I'll sell his horse, his saddle,

07:16.200 --> 07:19.010
and his personal items
to pay the undertaker

07:19.010 --> 07:21.650
but then you need to get out of town.

07:21.650 --> 07:25.070
I can't be having gunfights
in the middle of Main Street.

07:25.070 --> 07:27.730
And he may have family coming after you.

07:27.730 --> 07:31.180
- Yeah, it wouldn't be the
first time. I understand.

07:31.180 --> 07:34.480
- You're getting slow. He beat ya.

07:34.480 --> 07:35.803
- But his aim was bad.

07:37.360 --> 07:38.360
- Well, you won't last long

07:38.360 --> 07:40.300
now that you're slowing down.

07:40.300 --> 07:42.530
You just got lucky this time.

07:42.530 --> 07:43.960
Why don't you go home?

07:43.960 --> 07:45.500
Wherever that is.

07:45.500 --> 07:46.926
Family'll hide ya.

07:46.926 --> 07:51.163
- (chuckles) Dad died,
Mom remarried, and I left.

07:53.016 --> 07:55.147
- Well, why don't you find religion?

07:55.147 --> 07:57.063
- (laughing) Me?

07:58.430 --> 08:01.630
- Religion? That's a good one.

08:01.630 --> 08:04.870
Hey, there's a church over in Riverton.

08:04.870 --> 08:06.700
It's got a new pastor.

08:06.700 --> 08:09.163
Says he wants to tame the West.

08:10.180 --> 08:13.920
Brice Smith is the new pastor's name

08:14.960 --> 08:15.913
and he's let it be known

08:15.913 --> 08:18.343
that he wants to help people like you.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.730
- Seems to me that may be
just what you're looking for.

08:22.730 --> 08:25.663
Yeah. Why don't you go find religion?

08:26.770 --> 08:27.843
Or Mexico?

08:28.710 --> 08:30.350
I don't care which one.

08:30.350 --> 08:31.183
- Fine.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.600
- I'll have your reward
money tomorrow afternoon

08:37.900 --> 08:39.289
but then you need to leave town

08:39.289 --> 08:42.573
and leave Katherine alone.

08:49.570 --> 08:50.403
- Thanks.

08:54.355 --> 08:55.700
(door creaks)

08:55.700 --> 08:56.710
- Hey.

08:56.710 --> 08:57.543
- Hmm?

08:57.543 --> 08:59.260
- You want something else?

08:59.260 --> 09:03.540
- No. What I want I can't have.

09:03.540 --> 09:04.373
- What?

09:05.870 --> 09:10.024
- No, not that. Oh God.

09:10.024 --> 09:15.024
Oh.
(lively guitar music)

09:19.972 --> 09:23.972
(lively flute and guitar music)

09:37.597 --> 09:40.780
- God all I've got is beans.

09:40.780 --> 09:41.613
Ah.

09:44.490 --> 09:46.660
You can eat that or I'll
take you down to the river

09:46.660 --> 09:49.580
and we can get you some of that
new green grass if you want.

09:49.580 --> 09:51.003
It's up to you.

09:51.003 --> 09:54.173
All I know is that if I want
Katie, I've gotta fix this.

09:55.200 --> 09:56.623
She deserves better.

09:57.950 --> 10:00.290
Say that guy, Wilson,

10:00.290 --> 10:01.780
he was talking about a preacher,

10:01.780 --> 10:04.513
same name as my baby brother,
helping guys like me.

10:05.939 --> 10:09.710
(sighs) You think my baby
brother might've followed me

10:09.710 --> 10:10.893
all the way out here?

10:12.990 --> 10:15.563
No, I don't think I'm worth
following out here either.

10:16.970 --> 10:18.683
No, I don't think I talk too much.

10:19.610 --> 10:23.060
All I know is that you and I regardless

10:23.060 --> 10:25.660
are gonna have to go to
Riverton if I want the girl.

10:27.810 --> 10:28.890
Say, I wonder...

10:30.690 --> 10:34.803
I wonder if my baby brother
would even remember anything.

10:35.940 --> 10:40.113
I hope so because his father
was a miserable old bastard.

10:40.113 --> 10:42.013
- You talking to yourself again, Tate?

10:43.465 --> 10:45.690
(Tate sighs)

10:45.690 --> 10:48.400
- I have to, nobody else
listens to me anymore,

10:48.400 --> 10:51.290
not even Dusty.
(Katherine chuckles)

10:51.290 --> 10:53.070
- That was a close one today.

10:53.070 --> 10:55.760
Yeah, I'm getting too
old for this nonsense.

10:55.760 --> 10:57.013
- You and me both.

10:58.488 --> 10:59.693
I worry about you?

11:04.485 --> 11:07.250
So when can we stop this sneaking around?

11:07.250 --> 11:09.420
- Oh, well, probably just as soon

11:09.420 --> 11:10.930
as I'm done killing 'em all.

11:10.930 --> 11:12.670
- No, seriously.

11:12.670 --> 11:13.653
- I don't know.

11:15.362 --> 11:17.063
- We could run away to California.

11:18.700 --> 11:20.340
- Hmm.

11:20.340 --> 11:24.380
Yeah, we could, but somebody
there would probably

11:24.380 --> 11:27.770
recognize me and it would
just start all over again.

11:27.770 --> 11:30.963
Speaking of starting all over again.

11:31.920 --> 11:32.889
- Ouch!

11:32.889 --> 11:35.580
I wish you didn't have to
wear that gun all the time.

11:35.580 --> 11:38.350
- Yeah. You and me both.
(light guitar music)

11:38.350 --> 11:40.040
How 'bout I take it off for you?

11:43.530 --> 11:44.730
- [Katherine] You awake?

11:46.910 --> 11:47.743
- Oh.

11:49.320 --> 11:50.783
Well, I am now.

11:52.200 --> 11:53.403
- Couldn't really sleep.

11:54.400 --> 11:56.780
I kept wishing that things were different.

11:56.780 --> 11:58.447
- Well, they're not.

11:59.527 --> 12:02.257
- Couldn't you just stay
out here for a little while?

12:02.257 --> 12:05.310
And come back into town
like nothing happened.

12:05.310 --> 12:07.050
Maybe even get a job.

12:07.050 --> 12:10.058
All those gunfighters will
have to leave eventually.

12:10.058 --> 12:11.590
- I was asked to leave.

12:11.590 --> 12:12.737
- He didn't mean it.

12:12.737 --> 12:14.123
- Oh, yes he did.

12:15.610 --> 12:17.460
And I can't blame him.

12:17.460 --> 12:20.690
That was the third gunfight
on Main Street this month.

12:20.690 --> 12:23.483
- Then what are we gonna do?

12:23.483 --> 12:25.900
(Tate sighs)

12:28.190 --> 12:30.163
- Well, I could go to Riverton,

12:31.720 --> 12:33.140
wait my time out there,

12:33.140 --> 12:35.789
and wait until I hear all
the gunfighters have left.

12:35.789 --> 12:36.850
Then...

12:36.850 --> 12:37.683
- Then what?

12:38.610 --> 12:40.130
- Well, there's a preacher in Riverton,

12:40.130 --> 12:41.773
same name as my baby brother.

12:42.630 --> 12:45.420
So I've gotta check that out.

12:45.420 --> 12:46.253
- Preacher?

12:47.209 --> 12:49.209
(chuckles) You're related to a preacher?

12:50.320 --> 12:52.380
- It's possible.

12:52.380 --> 12:54.150
You know, my mother was
a God-fearing woman.

12:54.150 --> 12:56.250
Maybe she brought up my
brother in the faith.

12:56.250 --> 12:58.200
- Why didn't none of
that ever rub off on you?

12:58.200 --> 12:59.530
- Oh, I tried it.

12:59.530 --> 13:03.800
I prayed every night that my
stepfather'd stop beating me.

13:03.800 --> 13:04.633
When it didn't work,

13:04.633 --> 13:07.763
I gave up on praying and I left.

13:12.660 --> 13:14.160
Mm.

13:14.160 --> 13:17.807
Say, when can I see you again?

13:17.807 --> 13:20.070
- I'll try and sneak away from the store.

13:20.070 --> 13:21.550
Mama gets real tired nowadays.

13:21.550 --> 13:22.936
It's hard for me to leave her.

13:22.936 --> 13:25.060
(birds chirping)

13:25.060 --> 13:28.120
- Can I buy ya lunch at the cafe

13:28.120 --> 13:29.541
once you get all cleaned up?

13:29.541 --> 13:33.167
- (chuckles) Not with Wilson
hanging out there all the time.

13:33.167 --> 13:36.552
- Hm. Maybe I'll just
have to shoot him too.

13:36.552 --> 13:40.280
No, I'm just kidding.

13:40.280 --> 13:43.780
(Tate singing in Italian)

14:02.760 --> 14:05.480
- Living a Christian life
is harder than it looks.

14:05.480 --> 14:06.980
All around us are temptations

14:06.980 --> 14:08.930
that can keep us from our goals.

14:08.930 --> 14:10.240
Directly after today's service

14:10.240 --> 14:12.070
we're going to have a
celebration of baptism

14:12.070 --> 14:14.870
down at the river where our new members

14:14.870 --> 14:16.490
will receive their shield of protection

14:16.490 --> 14:18.393
and all are welcome to attend.

14:19.440 --> 14:22.120
The good book tells us
how God wants us to live.

14:22.120 --> 14:23.690
It's not a suggestion

14:23.690 --> 14:25.820
but a guide to find eternal salvation

14:25.820 --> 14:29.040
which is the only way to
achieve true happiness.

14:29.040 --> 14:31.760
The 10 Commandments keep it simple for us.

14:31.760 --> 14:33.370
Love they neighbor.

14:33.370 --> 14:35.190
Don't cheat on your wife.

14:35.190 --> 14:36.510
Don't kill.

14:36.510 --> 14:37.960
Love God.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.330
Could it be any clearer than that?

14:40.330 --> 14:41.510
We strive to follow

14:41.510 --> 14:44.633
but God provides forgiveness
for those who fall short.

14:45.640 --> 14:48.450
God loves us because we are his children

14:48.450 --> 14:50.590
and parents love their
children unconditionally

14:50.590 --> 14:52.290
even when they do something wrong.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.960
That is the good news for today.

14:56.010 --> 14:58.940
Now, let us stand and sing
our praises to the Lord.

14:58.940 --> 15:01.460
Lucy, what hymn are we going sing today?

15:01.460 --> 15:03.240
- Well, since we don't have any hymnals

15:03.240 --> 15:06.080
how about "Shall We Gather by the River"?

15:06.080 --> 15:08.040
- Everyone knows that.

15:08.040 --> 15:10.490
Now let's follow me down
to the river as we sing.

15:12.259 --> 15:17.259
♪ Shall we gather at the river ♪

15:17.788 --> 15:22.788
♪ Where bright angel's feet have trod ♪

15:23.127 --> 15:28.127
♪ With its crystal tide forever ♪

15:28.287 --> 15:32.204
♪ Flowing by the throne of God ♪

15:33.963 --> 15:36.810
(gentle piano music continues)

15:36.810 --> 15:38.613
- This must be the place.

15:39.500 --> 15:41.270
Wonder if I should wait
until the music stops

15:41.270 --> 15:43.670
or if I should just go in.

15:43.670 --> 15:45.203
I'm looking for a sign, Dusty.

15:50.010 --> 15:53.150
Oh, well, there's my sign.

15:53.150 --> 15:55.233
Spelled the correct way and...

15:58.750 --> 15:59.583
- Why hello.

16:00.590 --> 16:01.730
- Hello.

16:01.730 --> 16:03.130
- Would you like to join us?

16:04.420 --> 16:05.670
- I guess.

16:05.670 --> 16:07.240
- Everyone's out back by the river.

16:07.240 --> 16:08.900
There's a baptism today.

16:08.900 --> 16:10.140
Come with me.

16:10.140 --> 16:10.993
- All right.

16:13.012 --> 16:13.960
(lighthearted music)

16:13.960 --> 16:15.496
Come on, Dusty.

16:15.496 --> 16:17.343
I think you're too big to baptize.

16:19.348 --> 16:20.587
- In the name of the father

16:20.587 --> 16:22.853
and the son, and the holy ghost.

16:25.067 --> 16:28.113
Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!

16:31.119 --> 16:36.119
- Hallelujah!
(crowd clapping)

16:37.650 --> 16:39.000
- Tate.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.707
- Long time, little brother.

16:40.707 --> 16:42.500
- 12 years.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.310
- Honey, would you like a towel?

16:44.310 --> 16:47.380
- No that's why God created
hot, dry breezes. (chuckles)

16:47.380 --> 16:49.180
I need to go finish the Lord's work.

16:50.470 --> 16:51.483
- So you're Tate.

16:53.036 --> 16:55.005
That was quite an entrance you caused.

16:55.005 --> 16:57.010
- I was trying to sneak in unnoticed.

16:57.010 --> 16:58.630
- It didn't work.

16:58.630 --> 17:00.530
I'm your sister-in-law Lucy.

17:00.530 --> 17:02.623
- Oh. Oh pleasure to meet you.

17:07.680 --> 17:08.660
- When Mama was ill,

17:08.660 --> 17:09.967
I took care of her
(somber music)

17:09.967 --> 17:11.923
and she made me promise I'd find you.

17:12.810 --> 17:14.510
You broke her heart when you left.

17:16.550 --> 17:18.047
- You sold the place?

17:18.047 --> 17:18.970
- I had to.

17:18.970 --> 17:20.579
I couldn't take care of it all by myself.

17:20.579 --> 17:22.619
- Yeah, of course.

17:22.619 --> 17:24.200
- I didn't get much for it.

17:24.200 --> 17:26.660
And I used the money to go to college.

17:26.660 --> 17:28.034
There's no inheritance for you.

17:28.034 --> 17:30.490
- (chuckles) I didn't expect any.

17:30.490 --> 17:34.260
I'm just, I'm glad you got some
decent schooling out of it.

17:34.260 --> 17:36.030
- I was worried you'd be mad.

17:36.030 --> 17:38.183
It was originally your father's place.

17:40.910 --> 17:42.207
When I saw your name in one of those

17:42.207 --> 17:45.521
"Guides to Gunfighters
of the Wild West" books,

17:45.521 --> 17:47.130
I knew it had to be you

17:47.130 --> 17:49.190
and I could keep my promise to Mama.

17:49.190 --> 17:50.450
- Well, I'm glad you did.

17:50.450 --> 17:53.260
I always wondered what
happened after I left.

17:53.260 --> 17:55.760
- I wasn't surprised you
went down the wrong path.

17:56.950 --> 17:58.843
- Yeah. About that.

18:00.029 --> 18:02.600
(sighs) Those books are just crap.

18:02.600 --> 18:04.420
I'm not a gunfighter.

18:04.420 --> 18:06.680
I don't go looking for gunfights.

18:06.680 --> 18:08.230
They come looking for me.

18:08.230 --> 18:09.570
Call themselves shootists,

18:09.570 --> 18:12.543
or, you know, Caballeros, whatever.

18:13.430 --> 18:15.710
They're all just morons and murderers,

18:15.710 --> 18:18.360
just trying to kill me to
make a name for themselves.

18:19.650 --> 18:21.050
- They don't know you're here.

18:21.050 --> 18:22.760
Everyone thinks you're my brother.

18:22.760 --> 18:25.047
- Yeah, just give it
some time. It'll happen.

18:25.047 --> 18:30.047
(spurs clattering)
(ominous music)

18:32.943 --> 18:34.260
- [Marshall] Morning, Reverend.

18:34.260 --> 18:37.120
- Marshall, this is my brother Tate.

18:37.120 --> 18:37.960
Tate this our sheriff.

18:37.960 --> 18:39.020
He used to be a federal marshal

18:39.020 --> 18:40.585
before he moved to our town.

18:40.585 --> 18:42.760
(Tate clears throat)

18:42.760 --> 18:45.370
- Yeah, I heard your brother was in town.

18:45.370 --> 18:46.370
That's why I'm here.

18:48.160 --> 18:49.760
I know who you are, Tate Butler.

18:50.820 --> 18:53.230
- I'm just here to visit my brother.

18:53.230 --> 18:54.230
- That's good.

18:54.230 --> 18:56.330
I don't want any trouble in my town.

18:56.330 --> 19:00.000
And Mr. Butler, trouble
follows you wherever you go.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.150
- I'll be leaving soon.

19:02.010 --> 19:03.120
- [Marshall] Good.

19:03.120 --> 19:05.490
We got enough of your
kind around here already.

19:05.490 --> 19:06.760
- I don't like you
trying to run my brother

19:06.760 --> 19:07.610
out of town, Marshall.

19:07.610 --> 19:09.469
He's done nothing.

19:09.469 --> 19:11.750
- (chuckles) Not yet,

19:11.750 --> 19:13.170
but he attracts gunfighters

19:14.290 --> 19:16.690
and I don't need that kind in my town.

19:16.690 --> 19:17.670
You've got too many of 'em

19:17.670 --> 19:20.080
rehabilitating around here as it is.

19:20.080 --> 19:22.700
- As Christians, we must do God's bidding

19:22.700 --> 19:25.530
and help those unable to help themselves.

19:25.530 --> 19:26.883
- What would Jesus do?

19:28.780 --> 19:30.330
- That's got a good ring to it.

19:32.980 --> 19:33.813
- Marshall.

19:34.860 --> 19:36.140
Dinner's ready.

19:36.140 --> 19:37.290
- We'll be right there.

19:39.090 --> 19:41.093
That's not very neighborly, Marshall.

19:42.270 --> 19:44.600
- Well, my job's to protect the town

19:44.600 --> 19:45.650
not to be neighborly.

19:48.890 --> 19:49.763
You know, Brice,

19:50.830 --> 19:53.440
I'd like to help your brother if I could

19:53.440 --> 19:55.940
but I can't and protect
the town at the same time.

19:59.924 --> 20:00.841
- Marshall.

20:14.680 --> 20:17.260
- [Lucy] So does Dusty like it here?

20:17.260 --> 20:19.130
- Oh, I suppose so.

20:19.130 --> 20:21.608
We do a lotta camping, so,

20:21.608 --> 20:24.530
well, that's a nice change of pace.

20:24.530 --> 20:26.830
- Tate's been running
from the young guns too.

20:27.810 --> 20:29.340
- That's terrible.

20:29.340 --> 20:31.720
Brice's converts have the same problem.

20:31.720 --> 20:34.050
It's like you just can't
give up gun fighting.

20:34.050 --> 20:35.980
- Yeah, I'd like to settle
down and find a place

20:35.980 --> 20:38.453
but they'd just find me again.

20:39.630 --> 20:40.890
- Well, no one knows you're here.

20:40.890 --> 20:43.034
- Well, the marshal recognized him

20:43.034 --> 20:44.633
and that's why he was here earlier.

20:46.970 --> 20:50.120
We need to tell everyone he's
Tate Smith, your brother.

20:50.120 --> 20:52.200
- Yeah, it might be a
little late for that.

20:52.200 --> 20:54.690
- Well, it's never too late for prayer.

20:54.690 --> 20:55.523
- Uh...

20:56.570 --> 21:00.623
I'd like something a
little bit more tangible.

21:03.080 --> 21:06.370
- Tate could buy a place
here, settle down near us.

21:06.370 --> 21:09.030
- (scoffs) I'd like to

21:10.310 --> 21:13.300
but your Marshall Pearson
just asked me to leave.

21:13.300 --> 21:15.230
- He asked Tate Butler to leave.

21:15.230 --> 21:16.900
Tate Butler lives in Hayward.

21:16.900 --> 21:19.090
Tate Smith lives here in Riverton.

21:19.090 --> 21:20.990
- I am not going to lie for him, Lucy.

21:24.670 --> 21:26.080
- You could buy the Jensen's place

21:26.080 --> 21:28.960
on the outskirts of town
under the name Tate Smith.

21:28.960 --> 21:31.861
They wanna move back East
and you can get it for cheap.

21:31.861 --> 21:32.950
- How cheap?

21:32.950 --> 21:34.133
- [Lucy] 150 or less.

21:43.389 --> 21:45.224
- [Tate] Huh.

21:45.224 --> 21:46.170
- You go back to Hayward

21:46.170 --> 21:47.980
and make everyone think you live there

21:47.980 --> 21:49.413
and I'll get you that ranch.

21:53.248 --> 21:56.498
(tense drumming music)

22:19.466 --> 22:20.299
- Yah!

22:24.074 --> 22:24.907
Yah!

22:38.570 --> 22:41.030
So I was thinking about what Lucy is doing

22:42.210 --> 22:44.410
and I'm thinking it just might work.

22:44.410 --> 22:45.853
- [Katherine] Does he ever answer you?

22:45.853 --> 22:49.870
- (chuckles) Dusty is not a big talker.

22:49.870 --> 22:52.200
He's more of a listener.
(Katherine giggles)

22:52.200 --> 22:54.310
- I'm so glad you're back.

22:54.310 --> 22:55.550
So what happened?

22:55.550 --> 22:56.893
- I found my baby brother.

22:56.893 --> 22:58.640
- Really?
- Yeah.

22:58.640 --> 23:01.030
He looks like Mama and he's married.

23:01.030 --> 23:02.590
- Well, what's she like?

23:02.590 --> 23:04.170
- Oh, she's a strong girl.

23:04.170 --> 23:05.270
Perfect for him.

23:05.270 --> 23:07.160
I am a little worried
that they're not prepared

23:07.160 --> 23:09.280
for how hard life is out here,

23:09.280 --> 23:11.200
but she is helping me buy a ranch.

23:11.200 --> 23:12.400
- Well, that's great.

23:12.400 --> 23:13.233
- Yeah.

23:14.350 --> 23:18.340
So I was thinking we could
settle down out here.

23:18.340 --> 23:20.840
I could call myself Tate Smith

23:20.840 --> 23:24.310
and we could run some
cattle and grow a garden.

23:24.310 --> 23:26.633
- We?
- Mm-hm, I'm asking, Katie.

23:28.080 --> 23:30.870
- Father would never let
me marry a gunfighter.

23:30.870 --> 23:33.080
- Well, Tate Smith is a rancher.

23:33.080 --> 23:35.046
- You can't fool Father.

23:35.046 --> 23:37.163
- (chuckles) I'm gonna change that.

23:38.400 --> 23:39.233
- I know.

23:40.925 --> 23:43.430
- You know, I never asked for this life.

23:43.430 --> 23:46.110
That book turned me
into something I ain't.

23:46.110 --> 23:47.710
I've just been defending myself.

23:47.710 --> 23:48.543
- I know.

23:48.543 --> 23:52.010
- And sometimes, well,
sometimes I've thought to myself

23:52.010 --> 23:53.670
the only way I was gonna get it to stop

23:53.670 --> 23:54.870
was when I got killed.

23:54.870 --> 23:57.387
- No, not like that!

23:59.633 --> 24:02.683
I like the name change,
but it might not be enough.

24:03.730 --> 24:04.933
- I could grow a beard.

24:06.037 --> 24:09.420
- Hm. Come by the store
tomorrow. (chuckles)

24:09.420 --> 24:10.570
We'll talk more about it.

24:10.570 --> 24:13.350
- All right, I won't
have much time though.

24:13.350 --> 24:14.979
- Got some nice brown bread in.

24:14.979 --> 24:15.812
- Ooh.

24:15.812 --> 24:17.200
- Woman in town makes it for me.

24:17.200 --> 24:21.020
It'll go good with all those
beans you eat. (chuckles)

24:21.020 --> 24:23.960
Besides Mother said she wanted
to start taking long naps

24:23.960 --> 24:25.790
in the afternoons from now on.

24:25.790 --> 24:27.162
- Well, okay.

24:27.162 --> 24:29.320
(Katherine chuckles)

24:29.320 --> 24:30.803
- Don't worry about Father.

24:31.650 --> 24:33.330
He's only doing what he thinks he has to

24:33.330 --> 24:35.600
to make up for all those
years he hurt Mama.

24:35.600 --> 24:38.410
- Yeah, we're all trying
to make up for something.

24:40.220 --> 24:42.240
- I brought you some soap.

24:42.240 --> 24:43.840
Take a bath in the river for me?

24:45.160 --> 24:47.560
- What makes you think
I have time for this?

24:47.560 --> 24:49.320
Don't you love me the way I am?

24:49.320 --> 24:52.046
- I like the clean version better.

24:52.046 --> 24:54.360
(Tate sighs)

24:54.360 --> 24:56.073
Bath first.

24:58.303 --> 25:01.376
(Katherine chuckles)

25:01.376 --> 25:02.683
- (sniffs) Oh.

25:05.304 --> 25:08.637
(light rhythmic music)

25:18.091 --> 25:20.841
(dynamic music)

25:24.379 --> 25:27.773
(light rhythmic music)

25:27.773 --> 25:28.606
- Hey!

25:29.689 --> 25:32.470
Hey, Butler.

25:32.470 --> 25:34.913
Hey, I'm faster than you, old man.

25:36.830 --> 25:38.373
Hey! You hearing me?

25:39.503 --> 25:40.753
Said I'm faster than you.

25:44.534 --> 25:46.940
- I got no problem with you, stranger.

25:46.940 --> 25:47.870
- Faster than you, old man.

25:47.870 --> 25:48.857
(tense music)

25:48.857 --> 25:50.158
- Uh huh.

25:50.158 --> 25:53.741
(lighthearted tense music)

25:57.019 --> 25:59.852
(loud clattering)

26:07.170 --> 26:08.003
- Hey!

26:09.090 --> 26:09.940
Stop right there.

26:12.370 --> 26:13.203
- Nothing good
(tense music)

26:13.203 --> 26:14.820
can come from this, buddy.

26:14.820 --> 26:16.333
- I ain't your buddy.

26:16.333 --> 26:18.093
I'm just saying I'm faster than you.

26:19.703 --> 26:22.510
- (scoffs) Yeah, you probably are.

26:22.510 --> 26:24.770
Let's not fight about it, huh?

26:24.770 --> 26:26.330
- You're yellow.

26:26.330 --> 26:29.770
I'm gonna show to everyone
here that I'm faster than you.

26:29.770 --> 26:31.858
- Who cares who's faster.

26:31.858 --> 26:32.691
I don't.

26:33.620 --> 26:34.970
- I do.

26:34.970 --> 26:35.913
We all care.

26:38.550 --> 26:41.089
(tense music)

26:41.089 --> 26:43.890
(comical tense music)

26:43.890 --> 26:46.708
- Not so fast, ladies.

26:46.708 --> 26:48.160
(lighthearted tense music)

26:48.160 --> 26:48.993
Everyone clear outta here

26:48.993 --> 26:49.970
'cause there's gonna be a fight

26:49.970 --> 26:51.409
and you better get ready now.

26:51.409 --> 26:54.473
- Oh, now be careful, huh?

26:54.473 --> 26:55.904
- Want a countdown?

26:55.904 --> 26:56.960
- Do I want a countdown?

26:56.960 --> 26:58.920
I don't wanna do this.
(ominous music)

26:58.920 --> 27:00.436
- One.

27:00.436 --> 27:01.269
Two.

27:02.590 --> 27:03.879
Three.

27:03.879 --> 27:06.361
(guns firing)

27:06.361 --> 27:09.194
(dramatic music)

27:11.098 --> 27:13.000
(Tate sighs)

27:13.000 --> 27:14.460
- Lucky again, Tate.

27:14.460 --> 27:16.730
- Yeah, thanks, Sheriff.

27:16.730 --> 27:18.890
- Well, I couldn't risk it.

27:18.890 --> 27:20.070
Katherine would never forgive me

27:20.070 --> 27:21.786
if I let anything happen to you.

27:21.786 --> 27:23.243
(Tate chuckles)
- Father.

27:23.243 --> 27:25.460
Got these two for you.

27:25.460 --> 27:26.733
- [Sheriff] What did they do?

27:31.710 --> 27:32.733
- Well, Sheriff.

27:34.800 --> 27:36.316
- Oh, the Slim Gang.

27:36.316 --> 27:37.149
- Yeah.

27:38.030 --> 27:40.110
- You two, take 'em to jail.

27:40.110 --> 27:41.223
Come on, move!

27:44.760 --> 27:46.380
- That was too close.

27:46.380 --> 27:47.560
- Well, the only thing that matters

27:47.560 --> 27:49.563
is making it out alive.

27:51.360 --> 27:53.360
Slim here was wanted

27:53.360 --> 27:55.440
so you'll be collecting another bounty.

27:55.440 --> 27:57.173
- Ha! You shot her.

27:58.040 --> 27:59.230
- But it's my job.

27:59.230 --> 28:01.240
I can't collect the bounty.

28:01.240 --> 28:04.017
We'll just call it a, an
early wedding present.

28:04.017 --> 28:06.020
- [Tate And Katherine] What?

28:06.020 --> 28:08.610
- Besides once someone's dead

28:09.450 --> 28:10.480
what difference does it make

28:10.480 --> 28:12.560
what direction the bullet came from?

28:12.560 --> 28:13.393
- Thank you.

28:14.710 --> 28:18.283
- Well, it looks like I won't
need to call the undertaker.

28:19.460 --> 28:22.533
If her aim was better, I'd
be burying the two of ya.

28:23.880 --> 28:25.203
Need to be careful, Tate.

28:28.170 --> 28:31.660
Oh, and when you kill someone,

28:31.660 --> 28:33.830
you take their soul some say.

28:33.830 --> 28:37.240
Now you've gotta battle their demons too.

28:37.240 --> 28:39.073
- [Tate] But you're
the one who killed her.

28:40.770 --> 28:41.603
- I know.

28:42.510 --> 28:43.413
Get out of here.

28:45.430 --> 28:47.350
- Can I buy you a meal?

28:47.350 --> 28:48.620
- I wish I could.

28:48.620 --> 28:49.970
I gotta get back to Mother.

28:52.920 --> 28:53.973
- Not here.

29:00.010 --> 29:02.153
- Looks like you got lucky once again.

29:04.910 --> 29:06.287
You're gonna live to see another day

29:06.287 --> 29:07.710
thanks to your friend.

29:07.710 --> 29:08.820
(Tate chuckles)

29:08.820 --> 29:11.570
- I don't know why they wrote
all them books about you.

29:12.460 --> 29:15.200
You don't seem all that fast to me.

29:15.200 --> 29:17.993
When I was in my prime,
I was faster than you.

29:19.660 --> 29:21.713
- You were never a fast draw, Wilson.

29:22.736 --> 29:24.103
And you never had a prime.

29:25.030 --> 29:27.280
So shut up and stop
bothering my customers.

29:27.280 --> 29:28.980
- I'm just speaking my mind, missy.

29:28.980 --> 29:30.723
Ain't a man allowed to do that?

29:36.170 --> 29:38.403
- This may come as a rude awakening,

29:40.050 --> 29:41.963
but I'm not a gunfighter.

29:42.970 --> 29:46.670
All those stories in
that book are made up.

29:46.670 --> 29:49.820
The author made them up to sell books

29:49.820 --> 29:54.260
and he used my name because
he liked the way it sounded.

29:54.260 --> 29:56.337
- Well, just how much did they pay you

29:56.337 --> 29:59.342
for all them made up stories about you?

29:59.342 --> 30:01.157
- [Tate] (sighs) Nothin'.

30:02.070 --> 30:03.360
- Nothin'?

30:03.360 --> 30:06.600
Well, you sound to me like you got took.

30:06.600 --> 30:07.824
- Drink to that.

30:07.824 --> 30:12.004
(Tate whistling)
(insects chirping)

30:12.004 --> 30:13.020
Whoa!

30:13.020 --> 30:14.573
- I see the water was cold.

30:17.110 --> 30:18.920
- Ain't it rude to sneak up on a man

30:18.920 --> 30:20.920
when his ammo is wet?

30:20.920 --> 30:22.143
Throw me that towel.

30:26.560 --> 30:28.100
Thanks.

30:28.100 --> 30:29.590
I just got back from Riverton.

30:29.590 --> 30:32.810
You remember that preacher
Wilson was going on about?

30:32.810 --> 30:34.960
Turns out he's my baby brother.

30:34.960 --> 30:37.614
So I'm planning on
buying a place down there

30:37.614 --> 30:39.114
and settling down.

30:40.510 --> 30:42.090
- Well, that's good.

30:42.090 --> 30:44.790
I suppose you're gonna try
and take Katherine with ya.

30:45.960 --> 30:46.983
- I'm gonna ask.

30:49.070 --> 30:50.370
- Well, I'm not one to give advice

30:50.370 --> 30:53.853
on marriage since I
botched it with her mother,

30:54.770 --> 30:56.810
but I hope for Katherine's sake,

30:56.810 --> 30:58.853
she's strong enough to turn you down.

31:00.500 --> 31:01.423
Here's your money.

31:02.852 --> 31:04.830
- Put it in the saddlebag.

31:04.830 --> 31:06.380
Throw me those pants, would ya?

31:13.470 --> 31:15.380
- I know too much about your kind of life

31:15.380 --> 31:16.633
to want that for her.

31:17.600 --> 31:19.433
She'd be better off a spinster.

31:20.454 --> 31:24.753
- I am not a gunfighter.

31:25.900 --> 31:27.900
- I know you're not a gunfighter.

31:27.900 --> 31:29.700
You're too slow to be a gunfighter.

31:29.700 --> 31:31.150
We saved your butt this time

31:31.150 --> 31:34.740
but you may not be so lucky next time.

31:34.740 --> 31:37.280
And who asks someone to marry into that?

31:37.280 --> 31:39.680
Women don't wanna think
you might not come home.

31:40.870 --> 31:43.293
Katherine's mother asked me to quit once.

31:44.450 --> 31:45.303
When I didn't,

31:46.290 --> 31:48.550
well, you know the rest.

31:48.550 --> 31:51.053
- I do. I've heard all about it.

31:52.180 --> 31:55.893
And I am done with that.

31:56.730 --> 31:57.853
Throw me that shirt.

31:59.440 --> 32:01.740
- But are the other
gunfighters done with you?

32:03.910 --> 32:06.060
They won't be done with you, son,

32:06.060 --> 32:07.983
till you're dead and six feet under.

32:09.670 --> 32:11.253
So you better watch your back.

32:14.777 --> 32:16.590
(Tate sighs)

32:16.590 --> 32:18.620
- Here, Mother, let me help you with that.

32:18.620 --> 32:20.330
- I don't need no help.

32:20.330 --> 32:23.330
I can still handle things
around here myself.

32:23.330 --> 32:26.980
I might be old, but I'm
not dead yet, Katie dear.

32:26.980 --> 32:29.620
- Mother, I don't like to
hear you talk like that.

32:29.620 --> 32:31.760
- Well, it's the truth.

32:31.760 --> 32:34.200
Most people, my age are already dead.

32:34.200 --> 32:37.180
- But do we have to talk
about it all the time?

32:37.180 --> 32:41.109
- Well, we do so that
you'll know what to do.

32:41.109 --> 32:46.040
- But when it happens, I'll
call the undertaker, all right?

32:46.040 --> 32:49.063
- But do you know what dress
I want to be buried in?

32:51.360 --> 32:53.590
I've got the plot next to your grandmother

32:53.590 --> 32:55.190
reserved for me.

32:55.190 --> 32:57.740
There's one there for you too

32:57.740 --> 33:00.770
and a husband, if you ever get one.

33:00.770 --> 33:03.410
And I hope to God it's
not that Tate Butler.

33:03.410 --> 33:04.990
- Oh mother!

33:04.990 --> 33:06.550
- You need to know these things.

33:06.550 --> 33:08.530
- Well, now I do.

33:08.530 --> 33:11.380
- And you need to know
how to order merchandise

33:11.380 --> 33:12.700
for the store.

33:12.700 --> 33:13.893
- Fine, okay.

33:15.340 --> 33:19.610
- This is how the store is run.

33:19.610 --> 33:20.443
- I'll learn it.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.270
- You wouldn't have to do it all alone

33:23.270 --> 33:25.040
if you had a man in your life.

33:25.040 --> 33:27.363
- Like I said, I can learn it.

33:28.730 --> 33:31.190
- You don't need that
bad boy in your life.

33:31.190 --> 33:33.423
You need someone who will help you.

33:36.440 --> 33:39.243
Don't you go making
that same mistake I did.

33:42.140 --> 33:43.920
- You think we oughta
risk going to see Katie

33:43.920 --> 33:44.893
one more time?

33:48.490 --> 33:50.573
I never really properly proposed to her.

33:51.710 --> 33:52.560
I should do that,

33:53.474 --> 33:57.060
you know, with a gold ring
and get down on one knee

33:57.060 --> 33:57.893
and all that.

33:58.910 --> 34:01.663
I mean a proper proposal.

34:04.700 --> 34:07.083
That's, that's the way to do it.

34:09.107 --> 34:09.940
Oh, man.

34:11.050 --> 34:12.572
You think I can pull this off?

34:14.460 --> 34:17.143
Course with that reward money,

34:18.235 --> 34:21.013
could buy a real nice ring
with that, couldn't I?

34:22.744 --> 34:25.679
Do I go get the ring
or do I go see my girl?

34:28.449 --> 34:29.699
Thanks. That helps a lot.

34:33.409 --> 34:36.610
So I was wondering

34:37.719 --> 34:41.050
if you would help me pick
out a ring for Katherine.

34:41.050 --> 34:42.190
- I would love to help.

34:42.190 --> 34:43.261
- Oh, thank you.

34:43.261 --> 34:46.469
I need a ring, right,
for a proper proposal?

34:46.469 --> 34:48.663
I mean, did Brice have a ring for you?

34:50.170 --> 34:51.659
- I have your mother's ring.

34:51.659 --> 34:54.393
- My, my mother had a ring?

34:55.449 --> 34:57.150
- Apparently yes.

34:57.150 --> 34:59.420
- It must be from Brice's father.

34:59.420 --> 35:02.663
My father never had anything
but debt to his name.

35:04.030 --> 35:05.470
- I'm sorry.

35:05.470 --> 35:08.250
I know you didn't like
your stepfather much.

35:08.250 --> 35:10.160
- Yah, it's ancient history

35:10.160 --> 35:12.240
'cause I'm about to
own my own home, right?

35:12.240 --> 35:13.073
- That's right.

35:13.073 --> 35:16.290
I registered the deed yesterday
under the name Tate Smith.

35:16.290 --> 35:18.160
- You registered the deed?

35:18.160 --> 35:19.310
I can move in?

35:19.310 --> 35:20.310
- Today if you like.

35:22.230 --> 35:23.063
- Dusty!

35:25.330 --> 35:28.020
Dusty, we've got our own home.

35:28.020 --> 35:29.610
Oh, that's wonderful.

35:29.610 --> 35:31.393
Now Katie and I can start a family.

35:32.710 --> 35:35.160
- It'll be real nice having
a family around here.

35:36.460 --> 35:38.057
We wanna have a baby too.

35:38.057 --> 35:40.010
- I just hope Katie says yes.

35:40.010 --> 35:40.900
- You're a good man.

35:40.900 --> 35:42.770
Of course she'll say yes.

35:42.770 --> 35:46.720
Besides there's not much else
to choose from around here.

35:46.720 --> 35:50.232
- Wait, so I get the girl
because the options are bad?

35:50.232 --> 35:52.740
(Tate chuckling)

35:52.740 --> 35:55.400
- Brother. It's good to see you.

35:55.400 --> 35:56.980
I'm preparing a special sermon on Sunday

35:56.980 --> 35:58.180
and you should be there.

35:58.180 --> 36:01.190
I thought I would address
loving thy neighbor

36:01.190 --> 36:02.500
even though we're all different, you know,

36:02.500 --> 36:04.760
God's lost sheep and all that.

36:04.760 --> 36:06.850
I'm preparing the congregation
for when you move in.

36:06.850 --> 36:09.070
- So I should wait a few weeks

36:09.070 --> 36:11.120
until you prepared 'em for me.

36:11.120 --> 36:14.480
- No, you should be at
the church every Sunday

36:14.480 --> 36:15.900
showing God your commitment

36:15.900 --> 36:18.200
by putting your butt on the bench.

36:18.200 --> 36:20.360
- Yeah, I don't know how to
break this to you, brother,

36:20.360 --> 36:22.160
but I'm not much of a churchgoer.

36:22.160 --> 36:24.170
- [Brice] Well, now you are.

36:24.170 --> 36:27.750
- Tate was telling me about
this lady friend he has.

36:27.750 --> 36:29.870
- God is the one who
makes all things possible

36:29.870 --> 36:32.280
and you must show him your devotion.

36:32.280 --> 36:33.330
Without him in your life,

36:33.330 --> 36:36.560
your life is worthless.

36:36.560 --> 36:37.720
- Uh-

36:37.720 --> 36:39.710
- Tate was telling me about
this lady friend he has-

36:39.710 --> 36:43.460
- Tate must ask for
forgiveness for his sins.

36:43.460 --> 36:46.593
If he repents, our loving
merciful God will grant it.

36:47.680 --> 36:50.920
If you believe and are
baptized, then you are saved.

36:50.920 --> 36:54.250
And that is your good news, brother.

36:54.250 --> 36:55.570
- Yeah.

36:55.570 --> 36:58.010
- [Brice] Even though you've
taken the lives of others,

36:58.010 --> 37:00.920
God will forgive you.

37:00.920 --> 37:05.270
- You know, I really wasn't
worried too much about that.

37:05.270 --> 37:06.700
It was self-defense.

37:06.700 --> 37:08.870
- Turn all your worries over to Christ.

37:08.870 --> 37:10.170
- Yeah, I'm gonna.

37:10.170 --> 37:13.390
I'm gonna go ahead and go
take a look in the new place.

37:13.390 --> 37:14.650
Thank you for all you've done

37:14.650 --> 37:18.400
and I might see on Sunday, Pastor.

37:18.400 --> 37:20.160
- It's God's will.

37:20.160 --> 37:22.110
- Yeah, till Sunday.

37:22.110 --> 37:24.380
- You plan on staying for supper?

37:24.380 --> 37:25.213
- Thanks.

37:29.970 --> 37:32.120
- What was all that God forgiveness stuff

37:32.120 --> 37:33.570
you were giving Tate?

37:33.570 --> 37:35.130
- Well, he's killed many men

37:35.130 --> 37:38.040
and he has to make himself
right with the Lord.

37:38.040 --> 37:38.873
- I'm with him.

37:38.873 --> 37:41.430
I think the Lord understands self-defense.

37:41.430 --> 37:43.898
- Well, yes, but-

37:43.898 --> 37:46.290
- But you're his brother.

37:46.290 --> 37:49.000
He wants to start a new
life with his girlfriend.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.960
- That's wonderful but-

37:50.960 --> 37:54.143
- But, you need to be his
brother and not his pastor.

37:55.610 --> 37:56.870
You may have found religion

37:56.870 --> 37:58.613
but you have not found compassion.

38:11.564 --> 38:13.981
(Lucy sighs)

38:15.890 --> 38:18.763
God, if you're listening,

38:20.690 --> 38:22.800
please let me have a baby before them.

38:25.219 --> 38:27.886
(gentle music)

38:32.424 --> 38:33.257
- Ladies.

38:34.635 --> 38:35.468
Guess not.

38:39.880 --> 38:41.003
There it is.

38:42.190 --> 38:43.313
That's home for now.

38:44.400 --> 38:45.550
Hopefully forever, huh?

38:46.820 --> 38:48.170
Let's go take a look. Yeah.

38:53.010 --> 38:54.426
Boy, does it have promise, huh?

38:54.426 --> 38:55.259
(birds chirping)

38:55.259 --> 38:56.092
All right.

39:02.162 --> 39:03.045
Well.

39:03.045 --> 39:03.878
Yeah.

39:05.970 --> 39:08.133
Well, this is it, Dusty.

39:10.187 --> 39:12.770
(tense music)

39:16.500 --> 39:17.663
This is great!

39:19.240 --> 39:21.143
(sighs) Let's go check out that barn.

39:22.490 --> 39:24.823
Well, I promised you a barn, Dusty.

39:26.511 --> 39:30.060
(roof clattering)

39:30.060 --> 39:30.893
This is home.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.620
- What's the matter with you people?

39:40.620 --> 39:42.250
- Why can't you accept that we've repented

39:42.250 --> 39:43.543
and changed our ways?

39:44.670 --> 39:46.350
God has forgiven us.

39:46.350 --> 39:47.690
Why can't you?

39:47.690 --> 39:49.110
Come and set with me?

39:49.110 --> 39:50.571
Come and set with me now.

39:50.571 --> 39:52.043
(guns clicking)
- Move over.

39:56.260 --> 39:59.723
- Rejoice for the day that
the Lord has given us today.

40:03.400 --> 40:06.257
Lucy, "Amazing Grace".

40:07.396 --> 40:12.396
♪ Amazing grace ♪

40:12.817 --> 40:15.984
♪ How sweet the sound ♪

40:19.620 --> 40:21.659
- You had this whole section to yourself.

40:21.659 --> 40:23.900
- Yeah well, I guess I look
like I've got something

40:23.900 --> 40:25.175
they might catch.

40:25.175 --> 40:27.160
- Yeah, well, they'll come around

40:27.160 --> 40:29.495
once their ivory towers start to crumble.

40:29.495 --> 40:31.070
(Tate chuckles)

40:31.070 --> 40:34.063
- Yeah. I don't mind.

40:35.030 --> 40:35.870
Don't worry about it.

40:35.870 --> 40:37.020
- Did you get the ring?

40:37.960 --> 40:40.670
- There's one over at the general store.

40:40.670 --> 40:43.010
It's got an emerald and two diamonds.

40:43.010 --> 40:45.460
I told the owner you'd be over
to take a look at it for me.

40:45.460 --> 40:46.720
- I'll go tomorrow.

40:46.720 --> 40:49.210
- [Marshall] I see you
didn't take my warning.

40:49.210 --> 40:51.950
- Marshall. How's Linda?

40:51.950 --> 40:52.783
- She's good.

40:52.783 --> 40:54.520
She just left to go home and start supper.

40:54.520 --> 40:57.130
If you hurry, you can catch up to her.

40:57.130 --> 40:58.910
- Yeah, I think I'll stick around here

40:58.910 --> 41:01.540
and listen to you try to run
my brother-in-law outta town.

41:01.540 --> 41:06.380
- No. I think it more like
a little friendly advice.

41:06.380 --> 41:08.330
- It's too late for that.

41:08.330 --> 41:10.730
I've bought a place and
I plan on settling down.

41:11.624 --> 41:14.670
- You know, you're putting
the town's folk in danger.

41:14.670 --> 41:16.900
- They're in no danger from me.

41:16.900 --> 41:18.477
- Good.

41:18.477 --> 41:21.130
And when your friends come
around looking to kill you,

41:21.130 --> 41:22.780
I'll send them out to your ranch.

41:23.950 --> 41:26.033
- Nice of you to put my life in danger.

41:27.020 --> 41:28.970
- Just doing my job.

41:28.970 --> 41:31.120
- Can't you find a way
to protect Tate too?

41:32.180 --> 41:35.333
- You know, if I could
protect him, I would.

41:40.370 --> 41:42.403
- That's all right. I'll handle it.

41:43.650 --> 41:45.670
- Yeah, but can Katherine?

41:45.670 --> 41:47.070
- Have you seen her shotgun?

42:02.773 --> 42:05.883
- (giggling) I love you too, Tate.

42:10.480 --> 42:12.430
Good morning, Mrs. Cleveland.

42:12.430 --> 42:13.403
- [Mrs. Cleveland] Good morning.

42:17.240 --> 42:18.383
- How can I help you?

42:19.250 --> 42:22.050
- I wanted to make a Sunday
dress for my daughter.

42:22.050 --> 42:25.050
- Oh, well we've got a nice
selection of gingham right here.

42:25.910 --> 42:27.970
- Your mother's not here today?

42:27.970 --> 42:29.730
- She has trouble sleeping.

42:29.730 --> 42:31.770
Takes her a while to get
going in the mornings.

42:31.770 --> 42:32.743
She'll be in soon.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.283
- All old people have those problems.

42:37.280 --> 42:40.240
She was going to order
some pink bolts for me.

42:40.240 --> 42:41.563
Have they come in yet?

42:42.939 --> 42:45.850
- There doesn't seem to be much pink here.

42:45.850 --> 42:47.780
Let me check the ledger
to see what was ordered

42:47.780 --> 42:48.633
and what came in.

42:57.520 --> 43:00.463
There doesn't seem to be much pink here.

43:02.650 --> 43:04.950
- Well, this one's not bad.

43:04.950 --> 43:06.760
It could work.

43:06.760 --> 43:09.050
How long before more bolts come in?

43:09.050 --> 43:10.423
- Could be a month or more.

43:12.310 --> 43:14.343
- Well, this will have to do.

43:15.380 --> 43:17.680
Can you put it on our account?

43:17.680 --> 43:18.513
- Of course.

43:18.513 --> 43:20.020
- And send it to our house?

43:20.020 --> 43:20.853
- Absolutely.

43:35.350 --> 43:38.800
Mother, did you order any pink fabric

43:38.800 --> 43:40.593
for Mrs. Cleveland recently?

43:42.072 --> 43:43.423
- Maybe I did.

43:45.000 --> 43:45.833
Maybe I did.

43:50.390 --> 43:53.050
Or maybe I forgot.

43:53.050 --> 43:54.750
- Mother, you don't look well.

43:54.750 --> 43:56.920
Should I go get the doctor?

43:56.920 --> 43:58.750
- Doctors are for sick people.

43:58.750 --> 44:01.743
I'm just a little
confused about our stock.

44:05.516 --> 44:06.349
- Mother!

44:06.349 --> 44:09.099
(dramatic music)

44:28.374 --> 44:31.041
(somber music)

45:52.543 --> 45:53.960
How did you know?

45:55.070 --> 45:57.033
- You know how word gets around.

45:58.542 --> 45:59.853
- I'm so glad you're here.

46:01.314 --> 46:02.814
I don't know what I should do.

46:07.830 --> 46:09.400
- Marry me.

46:09.400 --> 46:10.233
- What?

46:14.160 --> 46:15.563
- Let me take care of you.

46:20.060 --> 46:21.680
Well, if it's too soon,

46:21.680 --> 46:23.640
I can wait.
(Katie whimpering)

46:23.640 --> 46:26.250
- I don't know what I should
do about anything anymore

46:26.250 --> 46:29.183
and I'm scared.

46:31.950 --> 46:33.870
Father said he'd help
me out with the store

46:33.870 --> 46:35.423
until I can sort things out.

46:43.789 --> 46:45.130
- [Sheriff] Where are
the candied apricots?

46:45.130 --> 46:45.963
- Uh, right here

46:45.963 --> 46:47.007
on the middle shelf.
(people chattering)

46:47.007 --> 46:49.580
- Oh, need to order more.
That's it for these.

46:49.580 --> 46:50.450
- Okay. Thanks.

46:50.450 --> 46:52.012
- That'll be two bits please.

46:52.012 --> 46:53.000
- It's good for breakfast.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.287
- Thank you, ma'am.

46:54.287 --> 46:57.163
- Oh and I need a pound
of six penny nails.

46:57.163 --> 46:58.813
- [Sheriff] You've got it, Katie.

47:01.080 --> 47:02.370
- [Tate] Pardon me, miss.

47:02.370 --> 47:04.430
- I'll be right with you.

47:04.430 --> 47:06.530
- Take your time. I'm in no rush.

47:06.530 --> 47:07.363
- Tate!

47:08.406 --> 47:09.877
(Katherine clears throat)

47:09.877 --> 47:14.690
Could you take these things
to their wagon for them, Pops?

47:14.690 --> 47:15.523
- Sure.

47:21.837 --> 47:22.860
(bottles clanking)

47:22.860 --> 47:24.274
- Thanks, Pops.

47:24.274 --> 47:27.000
(Sheriff grumbles)

47:27.000 --> 47:27.833
- [Sheriff] Looks like you fellas

47:27.833 --> 47:28.870
are gonna be doing some whooping.

47:28.870 --> 47:29.789
- We are.
- Yes, we are.

47:29.789 --> 47:31.660
- [Man] Thank you kindly.

47:31.660 --> 47:33.970
- What is going on in here?

47:33.970 --> 47:36.430
- Pops is helping me stock the shelves.

47:36.430 --> 47:37.936
- I never thought I'd see the day.

47:37.936 --> 47:39.290
(Katie laughing)

47:39.290 --> 47:40.730
- How long can you stay?

47:40.730 --> 47:42.950
- As long as you need me to stay.

47:42.950 --> 47:43.980
- It's not good for you

47:43.980 --> 47:46.780
to be hanging out here, Tate Butler.

47:46.780 --> 47:47.683
Keep moving.

47:49.210 --> 47:50.920
- You still the sheriff?

47:50.920 --> 47:53.430
- My deputy's handling
the day-to-day duties

47:53.430 --> 47:56.100
but it's still my jurisdiction.

47:56.100 --> 47:57.260
- Hmm.

47:57.260 --> 47:59.570
Well, the apron's a good look.

47:59.570 --> 48:03.690
We need a nanny, I'll
well, I'll send for you.

48:03.690 --> 48:06.035
- You should be leaving now, Tate.

48:06.035 --> 48:08.423
- You know anyone who
wants to buy a store?

48:09.780 --> 48:12.530
- So you decided to leave now, just now?

48:12.530 --> 48:14.770
- If Tate can't stay, why should I?

48:14.770 --> 48:16.810
- Well, this town depends on the store

48:16.810 --> 48:19.250
and you're the only one
that knows how to run it.

48:19.250 --> 48:22.330
- Pops is not the best shopkeeper.

48:22.330 --> 48:25.850
He's more of the run folks
out of town type person.

48:25.850 --> 48:27.070
- Yeah, I noticed.

48:27.070 --> 48:30.680
- Now, Katie, you know all I
want is what's best for you.

48:30.680 --> 48:31.560
I just wanna help.

48:31.560 --> 48:34.360
- Well, then get that order
on the counter ready for me.

48:40.760 --> 48:42.973
Give me that ring, Tate Butler.

48:52.670 --> 48:54.141
(glass shattering)

48:54.141 --> 48:56.706
- Oh, don't worry, I'll clean it up.

48:56.706 --> 48:59.629
- Uh, no, that's all right.

48:59.629 --> 49:00.629
I'll get it.

49:04.630 --> 49:07.400
Sorry it took me so long to decide.

49:07.400 --> 49:09.693
- That's okay. You're worth waiting for.

49:09.693 --> 49:13.250
- Working with my father
really helped me decide.

49:13.250 --> 49:16.260
- I noticed you two are
getting along better.

49:16.260 --> 49:18.493
- Yeah. He's not so bad.

49:19.360 --> 49:20.880
He just wants what's best for me

49:20.880 --> 49:23.573
but he doesn't know how or what that is.

49:24.660 --> 49:27.010
- I wish I could get
along with him better too.

49:31.221 --> 49:32.340
(register ringing)

49:32.340 --> 49:34.413
- Oops.
- That's okay, Father.

49:35.307 --> 49:36.140
- Oh no.

49:36.140 --> 49:39.070
I'm just no good at this line of work.

49:39.070 --> 49:39.943
- It's all right.

49:40.960 --> 49:43.410
- So what happens if
you don't find a buyer?

49:43.410 --> 49:45.300
You still gonna run away with Tate?

49:45.300 --> 49:47.920
- I'll hire someone to run the store.

49:47.920 --> 49:51.240
- Well, I can help out here
and watch the place for you.

49:51.240 --> 49:54.920
- I appreciate that but
maybe I can find someone

49:54.920 --> 49:58.200
a little more experienced. (chuckles)

49:58.200 --> 49:59.320
- Don't you think you
should get to know him

49:59.320 --> 50:00.200
a little better?

50:00.200 --> 50:01.520
- No.

50:01.520 --> 50:02.900
- Wouldn't you like a wedding?

50:02.900 --> 50:06.070
- Nah, signing some papers with
the judge is enough for me.

50:06.070 --> 50:07.920
Did I show you the ring he gave me?

50:07.920 --> 50:10.667
- Oh, that's real nice, Katie.

50:10.667 --> 50:12.500
(bottles clattering)
- Oh!

50:12.500 --> 50:13.820
Well, it's just me.

50:13.820 --> 50:16.330
I just snuck in the back
way to avoid being seen

50:16.330 --> 50:18.267
by the guys at the saloon.

50:18.267 --> 50:23.267
Huh. Yeah.
(lighthearted music)

50:26.820 --> 50:28.693
- [Katherine] What are you looking for?

50:28.693 --> 50:31.253
- Just watching people coming and going.

50:32.190 --> 50:33.223
- Any gunfighters?

50:34.247 --> 50:37.220
- Well, some cowboy just
came out of the saloon.

50:37.220 --> 50:38.573
Looks little suspicious.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.850
I think he works at the Bishop's
ranch, but I'm not sure.

50:46.867 --> 50:48.790
Ah, he's a hired hand.

50:48.790 --> 50:50.140
- Not a gunfighter?

50:50.140 --> 50:52.040
- Nah, he wears his gun belt too high.

50:54.645 --> 50:56.720
(sighs) Can't spend the
afternoon looking out the window

50:56.720 --> 50:58.570
watching for gunfighters anyway.

50:58.570 --> 50:59.403
- Why not?

50:59.403 --> 51:00.293
- It's a waste of time.

51:01.240 --> 51:04.890
- Eventually one'll ride in,
come in here, and call me out.

51:04.890 --> 51:06.610
There's nothing we can do.

51:06.610 --> 51:08.260
If a gunfighter's looking for me,

51:09.670 --> 51:11.714
they'll just come in here.

51:11.714 --> 51:12.890
I'm not that hard to find.

51:12.890 --> 51:15.394
- I'll tell 'em you moved to Riverton.

51:15.394 --> 51:17.843
- (scoffs) Tell 'em I'm dead.

51:24.665 --> 51:26.582
- Tell 'em you're dead.

51:29.193 --> 51:33.040
I could put an empty grave

51:33.040 --> 51:36.179
near mother's in the cemetery
with your name on it.

51:36.179 --> 51:39.083
- (chuckles) Yeah, that'd be a neat trick.

51:41.970 --> 51:45.250
- What does love thy neighbor really mean?

51:45.250 --> 51:47.700
Is it literal and just
means the house next door?

51:48.760 --> 51:50.560
It means mankind.

51:50.560 --> 51:54.210
It means treating others the
way you want them to treat you.

51:54.210 --> 51:55.560
Do you have to be kind to someone

51:55.560 --> 51:58.300
who doesn't go to your church
or someone you're pretty sure

51:58.300 --> 51:59.253
is not a Christian?

52:00.280 --> 52:03.110
What about the nice man
who's killed another?

52:03.110 --> 52:06.283
Is it really killing if
he's done it during war?

52:08.290 --> 52:10.140
It means love mankind.

52:10.140 --> 52:12.440
Give others the pleasure of your company

52:12.440 --> 52:13.943
and be kind to others.

52:15.360 --> 52:16.360
Have a blessed week.

52:23.050 --> 52:24.720
- [Man] Thanks, Reverend, good speech.

52:24.720 --> 52:26.220
- [Brice] God bless you.
- Where have you been?

52:26.220 --> 52:28.190
- Katherine's mother died
and I went to be with her.

52:28.190 --> 52:29.610
- Oh, so sad.

52:29.610 --> 52:32.430
- Thank you, but things being as they are,

52:32.430 --> 52:33.830
she wants to sell the store

52:33.830 --> 52:34.830
and move here with me.

52:34.830 --> 52:37.650
So do you know anybody
who wants to buy a store?

52:37.650 --> 52:38.483
- Hmm, let me think on it.

52:38.483 --> 52:42.390
- All right, in other news
she wants to marry me.

52:42.390 --> 52:43.540
- Oh, that's wonderful.

52:43.540 --> 52:45.960
- Yeah, but the store
is the last obstacle.

52:45.960 --> 52:48.323
- Don't worry. It will happen.

52:48.323 --> 52:49.156
- All right.

52:52.229 --> 52:55.540
(footsteps clomping)
(tense music)

52:55.540 --> 52:58.253
Why are all you lawman
such sneaky bastards?

52:59.143 --> 53:01.100
- 'Cause it's what we're good at.

53:01.100 --> 53:03.350
- Well, what brings you
all the way out here?

53:04.920 --> 53:07.830
- Well, I heard that you
were back from the funeral.

53:07.830 --> 53:10.930
- I got back Sunday
just in time for church.

53:10.930 --> 53:11.880
- And here I was thinking

53:11.880 --> 53:13.692
that you'd stay there with your woman.

53:13.692 --> 53:14.525
- Huh!

53:14.525 --> 53:16.170
I hate to disappoint you

53:16.170 --> 53:18.380
but I'm not wanted in that town either.

53:18.380 --> 53:19.500
That's why I bought this place

53:19.500 --> 53:20.803
and I plan to settle down.

53:22.316 --> 53:23.210
- Well, if that were possible,

53:23.210 --> 53:24.313
I'd be happy for you.

53:25.460 --> 53:27.170
I seen some stuff in town this week

53:27.170 --> 53:31.333
and because of Lucy, I sent 'em away.

53:32.780 --> 53:33.613
- Thank you.

53:34.743 --> 53:36.810
- I don't want any trouble.

53:36.810 --> 53:39.380
- Well, as soon as my wife
can sell her store in Hayward,

53:39.380 --> 53:41.280
I'm planning on bringing her out here.

53:42.450 --> 53:44.330
- Yeah. Lucy told me.

53:44.330 --> 53:46.503
I sent the Robinsons down to talk to her.

53:48.210 --> 53:50.580
They're good people the Robinsons.

53:50.580 --> 53:52.840
They're poor but they're honest.

53:52.840 --> 53:53.900
- Hmm.

53:53.900 --> 53:55.810
Well thank you again.

53:55.810 --> 53:57.680
That's unexpected.

53:57.680 --> 54:01.150
- Like I said, I want peace, Mr. Butler,

54:01.150 --> 54:03.763
and I'll get it any way I can.

54:07.070 --> 54:08.573
- All I want is peace too.

54:10.190 --> 54:11.023
- Well good.

54:11.023 --> 54:12.763
Then we got something in common.

54:15.500 --> 54:16.333
- Hmm.

54:19.810 --> 54:21.080
Howdy, darlin'.

54:21.080 --> 54:23.413
- Oh my God, you came back!

54:23.413 --> 54:24.826
- I told you I'd be back.

54:24.826 --> 54:26.800
- (laughing) It's been such a long time.

54:26.800 --> 54:27.633
- A week.

54:27.633 --> 54:29.320
- Yeah, that's a long time.

54:29.320 --> 54:30.980
- Say, Marshall Pearson said

54:30.980 --> 54:32.640
that he sent some people to talk to you.

54:32.640 --> 54:33.750
The Robinsons?

54:33.750 --> 54:35.850
- Yeah, they came in yesterday.

54:35.850 --> 54:39.280
Been trying to work with
them but they have no money.

54:39.280 --> 54:42.322
I could give give them a
loan, but I'm not a bank.

54:42.322 --> 54:44.013
Maybe I should-
- You're wearing my ring.

54:45.100 --> 54:48.007
- Did you listen to a word I just said.

54:48.007 --> 54:48.840
- Hm.

54:52.121 --> 54:54.181
(Tate grunting)

54:54.181 --> 54:55.377
- Be careful of that.

54:55.377 --> 54:58.060
It has my mom's dishes in it.

54:58.060 --> 54:59.280
- Why don't you go back inside

54:59.280 --> 55:01.460
and make sure we've got everything, honey?

55:01.460 --> 55:02.973
- Is there anything I can do?

55:04.083 --> 55:05.623
- Can I help?

55:05.623 --> 55:06.500
- Oh, why don't you come over here

55:06.500 --> 55:08.350
and help me tie down a few things, Horace.

55:08.350 --> 55:09.183
- Sure.

55:13.750 --> 55:15.500
- Hey Sheriff, come give me a hand.

55:17.270 --> 55:19.500
Katherine wants a few
of her mother's things.

55:19.500 --> 55:21.530
We'll be back for the hutch.

55:21.530 --> 55:22.563
- Don't worry. I'll take good care of it

55:22.563 --> 55:25.530
until you can come back
and get it for your home.

55:25.530 --> 55:26.363
- Thank you.

55:30.194 --> 55:32.480
(groans) Oh, why does everything she want

55:32.480 --> 55:33.613
have to be so heavy?

55:35.900 --> 55:37.380
- Things just aren't gonna
be the same around here

55:37.380 --> 55:38.750
with Katie gone.

55:38.750 --> 55:40.320
- Ah, don't worry.

55:40.320 --> 55:42.963
We'll be back from time to
time to check on things.

55:43.909 --> 55:46.993
- Well, I'll keep an eye
on things here for her.

55:47.950 --> 55:48.783
- Thank you.

55:54.260 --> 55:56.420
- Robinsons know where you are?

55:56.420 --> 55:58.270
- Yeah, but they're sworn to secrecy.

55:59.310 --> 56:01.090
- But can they be trusted?

56:01.090 --> 56:03.010
- Well, if they wanna keep
running the general store,

56:03.010 --> 56:04.660
they'll keep to themselves.

56:04.660 --> 56:06.610
- I think I've got everything for now.

56:06.610 --> 56:08.330
- Well, don't worry, Mrs. Butler,

56:08.330 --> 56:10.280
we'll take care of things here for you.

56:12.650 --> 56:15.853
Oh, I mean Mrs. Smith.

56:17.690 --> 56:19.280
- It was just an honest mistake.

56:19.280 --> 56:20.820
He didn't mean anything by it.

56:20.820 --> 56:22.510
- It won't happen again.

56:22.510 --> 56:26.360
- A mistake like that could
get my husband killed!

56:26.360 --> 56:29.750
- Yeah, it's just sort of really important

56:29.750 --> 56:32.460
that you remember from now on

56:32.460 --> 56:34.420
we're the Smiths.

56:34.420 --> 56:36.000
- Yes, sir. Smiths.

56:36.000 --> 56:37.850
Yes, sir, Smiths from now on.

56:37.850 --> 56:39.400
- That's right?`

56:39.400 --> 56:41.150
The Smiths.
- Smiths.

56:43.350 --> 56:44.810
- All right, Katherine,
we gotta get going.

56:44.810 --> 56:46.841
We got a long way to go.

56:46.841 --> 56:49.424
(somber music)

56:51.267 --> 56:52.100
Whoa.

56:55.750 --> 56:57.650
Remember we've got that one last stop.

57:05.080 --> 57:06.713
- Take a seat anywhere, mister.

57:08.010 --> 57:09.197
- That ain't no mister.

57:09.197 --> 57:10.643
That's Tate Butler.

57:12.620 --> 57:14.200
- Mornin', Wilson.

57:14.200 --> 57:16.620
- I see you're headed out of town.

57:16.620 --> 57:18.010
- I'm headed to Riverton.

57:18.010 --> 57:19.807
I'm giving up running for a livin'.

57:20.828 --> 57:22.245
- You're leaving?

57:23.156 --> 57:27.990
Uh, I wonder, if before you leave,

57:27.990 --> 57:29.723
could you sign my book for me?

57:30.810 --> 57:34.874
- Only for you would I
sign that vile thing.

57:34.874 --> 57:35.796
(ominous music)

57:35.796 --> 57:38.040
- Well, I'm here to stop you from moving.

57:38.040 --> 57:40.360
I don't want you in my town.

57:40.360 --> 57:41.233
- I've already bought a place

57:41.233 --> 57:43.300
and the wagon's packed.

57:43.300 --> 57:45.740
- And I owe it to the fine
peaceful loving citizens

57:45.740 --> 57:50.240
of Riverton to keep you
from moving to my town.

57:50.240 --> 57:51.860
- Well, if that's what they pay you to do,

57:51.860 --> 57:54.950
then I guess you're just
gonna have to do it.

57:54.950 --> 57:57.430
- Get in that wagon.
(tense music)

57:57.430 --> 57:58.940
Get outta town.

57:58.940 --> 58:02.350
- You can't prevent me
from moving to Riverton.

58:02.350 --> 58:04.600
- I don't wanna have to
kill you, Mr. Butler.

58:05.802 --> 58:07.753
But if you intend to head to Riverton,

58:08.880 --> 58:10.830
I'll do just that.

58:10.830 --> 58:12.650
- You're not gonna prevent me

58:12.650 --> 58:15.473
from taking my wife to Riverton.

58:16.820 --> 58:18.770
- Then I'm gonna have to challenge you.

58:19.690 --> 58:21.790
I don't wanna have to shoot you, Marshall.

58:23.260 --> 58:25.250
- There'll be no killing in my place.

58:25.250 --> 58:27.593
- Outside. Now.

58:29.450 --> 58:31.222
- This is gonna be good.

58:31.222 --> 58:33.805
(tense music)

58:37.112 --> 58:38.762
- I don't wanna do this, Sheriff.

58:40.067 --> 58:42.760
- Well, get up in your wagon
and head the other way.

58:42.760 --> 58:44.490
You're not wanted in Riverton.

58:44.490 --> 58:45.570
- I can't do that!

58:47.270 --> 58:48.103
- One.

58:49.250 --> 58:50.083
Two.

58:50.985 --> 58:51.818
Three.

58:51.818 --> 58:52.651
(guns firing)

58:52.651 --> 58:54.003
- Tate!

58:54.003 --> 58:56.670
(Tate grunting)

59:03.788 --> 59:04.631
(somber music)

59:04.631 --> 59:06.214
- I seen it myself.

59:08.107 --> 59:10.420
I seen it with my own eyes.

59:12.690 --> 59:14.320
Tate Butler, he's dead.

59:19.988 --> 59:22.670
- Go on, folks. There's
nothing to see here.

59:22.670 --> 59:24.683
Someone get me the undertaker.

59:26.453 --> 59:27.380
- Did you have to do this?

59:27.380 --> 59:29.203
- I'm just doing my job.

59:30.570 --> 59:32.270
Someone get this trash outta here.

59:54.650 --> 59:57.823
Everyone deserves a
second chance, Mr. Smith.

59:59.350 --> 1:00:00.740
- Good job, Marshall.

1:00:00.740 --> 1:00:01.890
Thanks for aiming high.

1:00:06.750 --> 1:00:08.890
Thanks to the chicken blood
and the sausage casing

1:00:08.890 --> 1:00:10.033
that really worked.

1:00:11.307 --> 1:00:12.450
What made you think of that anyway?

1:00:12.450 --> 1:00:14.796
- Oh, I got the idea from
when Pops broke that jar

1:00:14.796 --> 1:00:15.629
in the store.

1:00:15.629 --> 1:00:18.130
Thank God the marshal could aim high.

1:00:18.130 --> 1:00:20.890
- Yes. Thank God Lucy
got him to play along.

1:00:20.890 --> 1:00:23.310
- You think the town really believed it?

1:00:23.310 --> 1:00:25.400
- Oh, I know Wilson did.

1:00:25.400 --> 1:00:27.350
He'll remember that till his dying day.

1:00:28.310 --> 1:00:30.380
- How many hours is it to the ranch?

1:00:30.380 --> 1:00:32.130
- [Tate] All day and into tomorrow.

1:00:34.100 --> 1:00:36.880
- This is not what I thought
shopkeeping would be like.

1:00:36.880 --> 1:00:39.167
- What did you think it would be like?

1:00:39.167 --> 1:00:42.160
- More talking to people,
learning about the town.

1:00:42.160 --> 1:00:44.510
- Oh, gossiping.

1:00:44.510 --> 1:00:46.917
- No. You know I'm not like that.

1:00:46.917 --> 1:00:49.250
- (sighs) Whatever you say, dear.

1:00:49.250 --> 1:00:51.520
- Well, people in this
town are so standoffish

1:00:51.520 --> 1:00:52.890
compared to Riverton.

1:00:52.890 --> 1:00:54.680
- No, they're not.

1:00:54.680 --> 1:00:56.610
This is just a smaller place

1:00:56.610 --> 1:00:59.760
and people have to work
harder to make a living.

1:00:59.760 --> 1:01:03.363
They don't have time to hang
around town talking to you.

1:01:04.540 --> 1:01:06.595
- Well, she didn't have
to be so nasty to us

1:01:06.595 --> 1:01:08.960
about running the store for her.

1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:10.670
We're doing her a favor.

1:01:10.670 --> 1:01:13.900
- Now now there. She gave us a job.

1:01:13.900 --> 1:01:15.010
She's trusting us

1:01:15.010 --> 1:01:17.523
with this business when
no one else would help.

1:01:18.400 --> 1:01:21.077
- Well, she still treats us like dirt.

1:01:21.077 --> 1:01:22.355
(Horace sighs)

1:01:22.355 --> 1:01:24.855
(Helen sighs)

1:01:34.750 --> 1:01:37.440
- I thought you said the
people you bought it from

1:01:37.440 --> 1:01:39.070
left a lot of furniture.

1:01:39.070 --> 1:01:40.610
- There's a table and chairs.

1:01:40.610 --> 1:01:42.580
- No one can sit in those chairs.

1:01:42.580 --> 1:01:43.423
- There's a bed.

1:01:43.423 --> 1:01:45.240
- I am not sleeping on that.

1:01:45.240 --> 1:01:46.980
It looks like mice are living in there.

1:01:46.980 --> 1:01:48.780
- No, I'll put some new straw on it.

1:01:50.440 --> 1:01:52.270
Fine, I'll get you a new bed.

1:01:52.270 --> 1:01:54.150
- No, I'll get it.

1:01:54.150 --> 1:01:55.240
- Well, I'll go out to the field

1:01:55.240 --> 1:01:56.940
and I'll cut some new straw.

1:01:56.940 --> 1:01:57.773
- Thank you.

1:01:57.773 --> 1:01:58.773
- Anything else?

1:02:00.950 --> 1:02:02.043
- (sighs) Yeah.

1:02:03.576 --> 1:02:05.380
Get me some clean water.

1:02:05.380 --> 1:02:06.403
- Yes, dear.

1:02:06.403 --> 1:02:10.153
(light upbeat guitar music)

1:02:22.570 --> 1:02:23.513
- [Katherine] Hey, Tate.

1:02:23.513 --> 1:02:24.791
- [Tate] Coming.

1:02:24.791 --> 1:02:27.100
- Could you get me some more water please?

1:02:27.100 --> 1:02:28.224
- Yes, dear.

1:02:28.224 --> 1:02:29.891
- Thank you, my man.

1:02:51.684 --> 1:02:54.434
(ominous music)

1:02:55.837 --> 1:02:57.233
- Ah, no smoking in here.

1:03:16.230 --> 1:03:19.023
- Two cans of beans and
two pounds of coffee.

1:03:19.930 --> 1:03:22.443
- You need me to grind
that coffee for you?

1:03:24.107 --> 1:03:26.300
- I usually just use a rock.

1:03:26.300 --> 1:03:28.753
- Ah, you been on the trail long?

1:03:30.557 --> 1:03:34.670
- Well, (chuckles) seems like all my life.

1:03:34.670 --> 1:03:36.250
- Oh, what's your name, stranger,

1:03:36.250 --> 1:03:37.500
and where are you headed?

1:03:41.370 --> 1:03:42.333
- John Scott.

1:03:44.020 --> 1:03:45.723
Just an old man passing through.

1:03:46.862 --> 1:03:47.850
- Well, you look like you've got

1:03:47.850 --> 1:03:50.050
a hoot and holler left in ya.

1:03:50.050 --> 1:03:51.760
Where are you from?

1:03:51.760 --> 1:03:53.023
- Original, Indiana.

1:03:55.860 --> 1:03:59.063
But I left there years
ago after my parents died.

1:04:01.280 --> 1:04:02.243
- [Helen] Indians?

1:04:03.130 --> 1:04:03.963
- No.

1:04:06.620 --> 1:04:07.453
Fever.

1:04:08.420 --> 1:04:09.993
- That's a terrible way to go.

1:04:10.941 --> 1:04:12.870
- I don't wanna talk about it.

1:04:12.870 --> 1:04:15.083
- Horace lost his first wife to the fever.

1:04:16.270 --> 1:04:18.430
- I said I don't wanna talk about it.

1:04:18.430 --> 1:04:19.263
- He hasn't been

1:04:19.263 --> 1:04:20.250
the same since.
- What is with-

1:04:20.250 --> 1:04:21.180
- That's right.

1:04:21.180 --> 1:04:24.160
- Anyway, looking for a friend of mine.

1:04:24.160 --> 1:04:27.290
I thought he lived here,
but he might've moved.

1:04:27.290 --> 1:04:28.870
- Well, we just moved here ourselves

1:04:28.870 --> 1:04:31.980
so I doubt we're gonna be much help.

1:04:31.980 --> 1:04:33.880
- I guess you don't know
where I'd find my friend.

1:04:33.880 --> 1:04:35.293
His name's Tate Butler.

1:04:38.630 --> 1:04:40.250
- Tate Butler?

1:04:40.250 --> 1:04:43.167
His name is Smith now
and he moved to Riverton.

1:04:43.167 --> 1:04:44.580
- No, it's not!

1:04:44.580 --> 1:04:48.143
Tate Butler got killed in that gunfight.

1:04:49.687 --> 1:04:51.380
- I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

1:04:51.380 --> 1:04:52.270
That's right.

1:04:52.270 --> 1:04:54.340
Tate Butler's buried in the cemetery.

1:04:54.340 --> 1:04:56.970
- [Horace] You need me
to get you anything else?

1:04:56.970 --> 1:04:58.050
- Cemetery, huh?

1:04:59.336 --> 1:05:04.336
No, got everything I need.
(coin clattering)

1:05:07.669 --> 1:05:08.640
(door slamming)

1:05:08.640 --> 1:05:10.670
- What's wrong with you, woman?

1:05:10.670 --> 1:05:12.330
- He wasn't no gunfighter.

1:05:12.330 --> 1:05:14.550
- Then why was he asking about Tate?

1:05:14.550 --> 1:05:17.622
Oh, John Scott.

1:05:17.622 --> 1:05:21.890
(gasps) What if that
was Deadshot John Scott?

1:05:21.890 --> 1:05:24.060
- [Helen] It doesn't matter who he is.

1:05:24.060 --> 1:05:26.523
- You better hope he
doesn't go to Riverton.

1:05:27.850 --> 1:05:30.270
- Hm. I didn't mean anything.

1:05:30.270 --> 1:05:32.360
- Well, just keep it quiet.

1:05:32.360 --> 1:05:34.980
We don't know how it got out.

1:05:34.980 --> 1:05:36.098
- I don't know nothing.

1:05:36.098 --> 1:05:37.297
- Huh.

1:05:37.297 --> 1:05:39.880
(tense music)

1:05:46.827 --> 1:05:49.577
(ominous music)

1:05:52.159 --> 1:05:55.492
(tense drumming music)

1:06:16.020 --> 1:06:17.650
- It's good to see both of you.

1:06:17.650 --> 1:06:18.640
How do you feel?

1:06:18.640 --> 1:06:20.309
- Terrible.

1:06:20.309 --> 1:06:22.320
I just can't get comfortable.

1:06:22.320 --> 1:06:23.520
- Will it be soon?

1:06:23.520 --> 1:06:25.233
- I'm supposed to have another month.

1:06:25.233 --> 1:06:26.590
I just want it to be over.

1:06:26.590 --> 1:06:28.710
I can't live another month like this.

1:06:28.710 --> 1:06:32.250
All I do was lie in bed and get fatter.

1:06:32.250 --> 1:06:34.670
- I would change places
with you in a minute.

1:06:34.670 --> 1:06:36.990
- And I don't look forward
to that bumpy wagon ride

1:06:36.990 --> 1:06:38.300
all the way home either.

1:06:38.300 --> 1:06:41.363
Coming, I thought I had
to pee the whole time.

1:06:42.250 --> 1:06:43.720
Get back here!

1:06:43.720 --> 1:06:44.823
- What do you want?

1:06:46.220 --> 1:06:49.040
- Maybe the trip home will induce labor.

1:06:49.040 --> 1:06:52.520
I just can't wait for this baby to arrive.

1:06:52.520 --> 1:06:56.390
- Tate, do you know what to
do when she goes into labor?

1:06:56.390 --> 1:06:57.223
- Well...

1:06:58.318 --> 1:06:59.963
Well, Doc told me a few things.

1:07:00.950 --> 1:07:03.144
I'm gonna go talk to Brice.

1:07:03.144 --> 1:07:05.330
- Oh.

1:07:05.330 --> 1:07:06.163
- Good morning.

1:07:06.163 --> 1:07:07.358
- [Tate] Okay.

1:07:07.358 --> 1:07:09.697
- Honey, don't let your baby grow up

1:07:09.697 --> 1:07:11.323
to be gunfighters.

1:07:12.420 --> 1:07:16.140
- God works in mysterious
ways and sometimes

1:07:16.140 --> 1:07:17.743
it's not what we asked for.

1:07:18.840 --> 1:07:21.640
Not all of us are meant to be farmers

1:07:21.640 --> 1:07:25.193
or ranchers or parents.

1:07:27.510 --> 1:07:30.320
God knows what our true purpose is.

1:07:30.320 --> 1:07:33.007
And you must not question him.

1:07:33.007 --> 1:07:38.007
(piano clanging)
(footsteps clomping)

1:07:39.490 --> 1:07:40.490
See you next Sunday.

1:07:49.664 --> 1:07:53.380
(light somber music)

1:07:53.380 --> 1:07:55.190
How's it going, old man?

1:07:55.190 --> 1:07:56.330
How's married life treating you?

1:07:56.330 --> 1:07:57.780
- Oh, it agrees with me.

1:07:57.780 --> 1:08:00.030
Maybe a little bit too
much if you ask Dusty.

1:08:01.490 --> 1:08:04.630
So, you know Lucy

1:08:04.630 --> 1:08:07.163
would really love to have a baby.

1:08:08.010 --> 1:08:09.380
- We've been trying.

1:08:09.380 --> 1:08:11.310
- Well, she doesn't need you telling her

1:08:11.310 --> 1:08:13.000
she can't have a baby

1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:14.750
in front of the entire congregation

1:08:14.750 --> 1:08:16.520
in your sermon this morning.

1:08:16.520 --> 1:08:18.410
- That's not what I meant.

1:08:18.410 --> 1:08:19.920
- Jesus Christ.

1:08:19.920 --> 1:08:21.387
I'm sorry, brother, I'm sorry.

1:08:21.387 --> 1:08:24.380
But you're a slower draw than I am.

1:08:24.380 --> 1:08:25.853
It came off as mean.

1:08:27.069 --> 1:08:28.639
Maybe you could be a
little bit more sensitive

1:08:28.639 --> 1:08:31.090
about her, you know, feelings.

1:08:31.090 --> 1:08:33.700
- Advice from my newly
married big brother?

1:08:33.700 --> 1:08:34.813
- She was crying.

1:08:37.425 --> 1:08:38.370
- I didn't see that.

1:08:38.370 --> 1:08:39.513
- I know you didn't.

1:08:41.487 --> 1:08:43.130
- And I know 'cause you're up here,

1:08:43.130 --> 1:08:44.050
you're busy preaching,

1:08:44.050 --> 1:08:45.130
you're busy with the Lord,

1:08:45.130 --> 1:08:47.620
and well, I knew that if you knew

1:08:47.620 --> 1:08:49.819
you wouldn't wanna hurt her.

1:08:49.819 --> 1:08:50.710
- Thanks.

1:08:50.710 --> 1:08:51.542
- You guys have taught me that family

1:08:51.542 --> 1:08:53.920
have gotta look out for each other.

1:08:53.920 --> 1:08:55.620
I've got your back, little brother

1:08:57.110 --> 1:09:00.666
- Someday, I hope to have yours too.

1:09:00.666 --> 1:09:02.515
- Well, let's hope you don't have to.

1:09:07.410 --> 1:09:08.243
- Lucy.

1:09:12.450 --> 1:09:13.282
You were right.

1:09:14.740 --> 1:09:17.479
I found God and was in such
a hurry to find my brother

1:09:18.618 --> 1:09:20.093
that I lost my compassion.

1:09:22.160 --> 1:09:22.993
I'm sorry.

1:09:36.170 --> 1:09:37.020
- Can I help you?

1:09:39.777 --> 1:09:41.880
- I'm looking for Tate Smith.

1:09:41.880 --> 1:09:43.630
- What do you want with Tate Smith?

1:09:45.020 --> 1:09:47.180
- We have business together.

1:09:47.180 --> 1:09:48.180
- Well, that's funny

1:09:49.290 --> 1:09:51.309
'cause I know Tate Smith real well

1:09:52.276 --> 1:09:53.362
and I don't know you.

1:09:54.330 --> 1:09:55.580
- What are you his daddy?

1:09:56.620 --> 1:09:57.683
- Not exactly.

1:09:59.800 --> 1:10:01.500
- I'd appreciate some cooperation.

1:10:02.690 --> 1:10:05.290
You know where I can find Tate Smith?

1:10:05.290 --> 1:10:07.663
- What if I was to tell
you I was Tate Smith?

1:10:13.612 --> 1:10:16.320
- I'd say you're a liar.

1:10:16.320 --> 1:10:17.287
See, Tate Butler,

1:10:17.287 --> 1:10:19.163
who now calls himself Smith,

1:10:20.081 --> 1:10:21.130
is a lot younger

1:10:22.059 --> 1:10:23.702
and way better looking than you.

1:10:24.600 --> 1:10:26.993
- Oh, aren't you a rude ray of sunshine.

1:10:28.510 --> 1:10:29.343
Who sent you?

1:10:32.420 --> 1:10:33.833
- Nobody sends me anywhere.

1:10:35.320 --> 1:10:36.570
I'm here to call him out.

1:10:37.900 --> 1:10:39.183
- You're a gunfighter.

1:10:40.680 --> 1:10:42.910
Well, keep riding 'cause nobody here

1:10:42.910 --> 1:10:44.503
wants to play your game.

1:10:45.490 --> 1:10:47.240
- Boy, you're dumber than you look.

1:10:50.271 --> 1:10:51.728
You look...

1:10:51.728 --> 1:10:54.228
(tense music)

1:10:59.710 --> 1:11:01.993
The years have not been
kind to you, my friend.

1:11:13.341 --> 1:11:15.219
(tense music)

1:11:15.219 --> 1:11:17.887
Strap it on, Tate Butler.

1:11:21.422 --> 1:11:22.255
Now!

1:11:27.607 --> 1:11:30.195
(gun firing)

1:11:30.195 --> 1:11:31.507
- Katherine!

1:11:31.507 --> 1:11:32.340
- Tate!

1:11:33.705 --> 1:11:35.601
I think I'm in labor.

1:11:35.601 --> 1:11:38.139
(lighthearted music)
- I'll be right there.

1:11:38.139 --> 1:11:39.957
Good shot, honey.

1:11:39.957 --> 1:11:40.790
- Oh.

1:11:50.340 --> 1:11:51.710
- I still look like this.

1:11:55.955 --> 1:12:00.038
- But you don't look like
that anymore, Deadshot.

1:12:01.581 --> 1:12:02.496
- Tate!

1:12:02.496 --> 1:12:03.610
- [Tate] I'm coming.

1:12:03.610 --> 1:12:04.759
He's dead.

1:12:04.759 --> 1:12:06.431
- I know he's dead.

1:12:06.431 --> 1:12:08.617
Can't you see I'm having a baby?

1:12:08.617 --> 1:12:11.094
- All right, hang on.

1:12:11.094 --> 1:12:12.210
- Hurry up.

1:12:12.210 --> 1:12:14.833
- [Tate] Hold your horses.

1:12:14.833 --> 1:12:17.500
(both grunting)

1:12:26.231 --> 1:12:27.706
(door clattering)

1:12:27.706 --> 1:12:30.873
(upbeat guitar music)

1:12:44.693 --> 1:12:47.193
(baby crying)

1:13:13.462 --> 1:13:16.901
(dramatic music)

1:13:16.901 --> 1:13:20.318
(light juice harp music)

1:13:26.454 --> 1:13:29.621
(lighthearted music)
