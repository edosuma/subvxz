00:10.300 --> 00:12.700
Previously on 24

00:14.300 --> 00:17.360
That was Bob Cornell at NSA.

00:17.430 --> 00:19.360
They've detected another firewall breach.

00:19.430 --> 00:21.500
There's been another attack?

00:21.560 --> 00:24.260
Not yet,but they believe the
CIP device is being utilized.

00:24.330 --> 00:27.030
We have to assume Dubaku is
initiating another attack.

00:27.100 --> 00:29.600
- Madam President. - What is it,Tim?

00:29.660 --> 00:32.030
I've just been forwarded a scrambled call.

00:32.100 --> 00:33.800
It's from colonel Dubaku.

00:33.860 --> 00:34.660
He's demanding to speak with you.

00:34.880 --> 00:36.080
The deadline for your forces

00:36.150 --> 00:37.750
To begin their withdrawal has passed.

00:37.810 --> 00:38.980
Go to the window.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.250
See what you have done.

00:40.310 --> 00:43.780
Comply with my demands within the hour,

00:43.850 --> 00:45.910
Or 10,000 more Americans will die.

00:49.850 --> 00:50.850
She's on her way up.

00:50.910 --> 00:52.450
I'll call you when it's done.

00:52.510 --> 00:54.880
Mr. Taylor,are you okay?

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:06.250 --> 01:08.550
Audio forensics cleaned up the recording.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.750
Walker is extraneous.

01:10.810 --> 01:13.580
Kill her before you get here.

01:13.650 --> 01:15.010
Larry,I don't think it's worth it.

01:15.080 --> 01:16.050
There's nothing here.

01:16.110 --> 01:17.210
All right. Fine,

01:17.280 --> 01:18.550
Help Janis coordinate with NSA.

01:18.610 --> 01:19.780
I'm sorry about renee.

01:19.850 --> 01:20.980
She was a good agent.

01:21.050 --> 01:23.280
We don't know that she's dead yet!

01:23.350 --> 01:25.080
I've devoted my life to the Bureau

01:25.150 --> 01:26.550
And you just expect me to believe

01:26.610 --> 01:28.310
That the entire government's been corrupted.

01:28.380 --> 01:29.680
Not all of them.

01:29.750 --> 01:32.210
But until we find out who,we can't trust anyone.

01:32.280 --> 01:34.150
And the four of you really
think you can stop this?

01:34.210 --> 01:36.150
We have to.

01:36.210 --> 01:38.280
It's as simple as that.

01:38.350 --> 01:39.510
Dubaku wants you and your wife.

01:39.580 --> 01:40.550
That's the deal.

01:40.610 --> 01:42.680
You're asking us to risk our lives

01:42.750 --> 01:44.610
To be delivered into Dubaku's hands.

01:44.680 --> 01:46.250
Listen to him,Ule.

01:46.310 --> 01:48.210
But how can we trust this man?

01:48.280 --> 01:49.250
Because

01:49.310 --> 01:51.410
He has no reason to lie.

01:51.480 --> 01:52.610
How are you doing,Tony?

01:52.680 --> 01:53.650
All right.

01:53.710 --> 01:54.910
Where's Emerson?

01:54.980 --> 01:55.910
He's dead.

01:55.980 --> 01:56.980
You want Matobo or not?

02:04.980 --> 02:06.080
You got what you came for.

02:07.310 --> 02:09.350
Now,get the hell out of here.

02:09.410 --> 02:10.810
Did everything go smoothly?

02:10.880 --> 02:12.810
We have the Matobos,that's what matters.

02:12.880 --> 02:15.180
I heard about the planes on the radio.

02:15.250 --> 02:18.050
The White House still has not complied.

02:18.110 --> 02:19.010
What do you intend to do?

02:19.080 --> 02:20.980
Exactly what we promised.

02:21.050 --> 02:22.010
We're ready,sir.

02:22.080 --> 02:23.310
Where's the target located?

02:23.380 --> 02:25.010
Kidron,Ohio.

02:25.080 --> 02:27.050
- Population? - 30,000.

02:27.110 --> 02:28.310
Casualties will be high.

02:28.380 --> 02:30.780
Begin.

02:41.050 --> 02:42.980
Larry.

02:43.050 --> 02:45.980
We think this is the truck
the Matobos were abducted in.

02:47.310 --> 02:48.410
Where was this image taken?

02:48.480 --> 02:49.410
Near Northwoods Airfield.

02:49.480 --> 02:50.550
Were you able to track it?

02:50.610 --> 02:51.780
Not beyond this sector.

02:51.850 --> 02:53.550
But they were heading east on Mckinley Avenue.

02:53.610 --> 02:54.780
All right. Make sure the vehicle i.d.

02:54.850 --> 02:56.610
Is disseminated to all search teams

02:56.680 --> 02:58.050
- And local agencies. - Yes,sir.

02:58.110 --> 03:00.880
- Larry,I think I found something. - Yeah?

03:00.950 --> 03:03.550
I've been working NSA,trying
to back-trace the CIP attack

03:03.610 --> 03:04.810
That took down the two planes.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.650
And I found a code fragment

03:06.710 --> 03:09.480
Which I think could be
residue from the CIP intrusion.

03:09.550 --> 03:10.950
I'm running a pattern match right now.

03:11.010 --> 03:12.280
With any luck at all,

03:12.350 --> 03:14.450
We may be able to anticipate
where in the infrastructure

03:14.510 --> 03:15.550
They're targeting next.

03:15.610 --> 03:16.710
And I need Sean.

03:16.780 --> 03:18.310
Janis,I don't want to waste personnel

03:18.380 --> 03:19.680
On some wild-goose chase.

03:19.750 --> 03:21.480
Dubaku's threatened to kill 10,000 more Americans

03:21.550 --> 03:22.710
in the next 30 minutes.

03:22.780 --> 03:23.910
I understand that,

03:23.980 --> 03:25.680
and I will drop it the minute it feels cold.

03:25.750 --> 03:27.750
All right,I'm going to brief the
White House. Keep me in the loop.

03:27.850 --> 03:29.810
Sean.

03:34.480 --> 03:37.080
Are you sure he's up to running this operation?

03:37.150 --> 03:39.080
- Larry's fine. - Is he?

03:39.150 --> 03:41.410
You're the one who told me about him and Renee.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.410
This has got to be hitting him pretty hard.

03:43.480 --> 03:46.080
If I don't think Larry can do his job,

03:46.150 --> 03:47.480
I'll let you know,all right?

03:47.550 --> 03:50.510
In the meantime,I need you
to open up a fresh socket.

04:07.910 --> 04:10.980
You've reached Agent Brian Gedge.

04:11.050 --> 04:13.010
Please leave a message and I'll get back to you.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.010
Agent Gedge,

04:15.080 --> 04:17.410
I expected to hear from you by now.

04:17.480 --> 04:19.579
It's urgent that I speak with the first gentleman

04:19.649 --> 04:20.980
as soon as possible.

04:23.010 --> 04:24.780
Call me back,Agent Gedge.

04:24.850 --> 04:26.510
This is extremely important.

04:26.580 --> 04:28.550
Yes?

04:28.610 --> 04:30.210
Larry Moss with the FBI.

04:30.280 --> 04:31.480
Where are we,Larry?

04:31.550 --> 04:32.810
We've I.D.'d a vehicle

04:32.880 --> 04:34.650
that we believe was used
in the Matobos' abduction.

04:34.710 --> 04:36.110
We're still trying to track it down.

04:36.180 --> 04:37.910
And how long is that going to take?

04:37.980 --> 04:39.980
I wish I could tell you,sir.
I don't have a time frame.

04:40.050 --> 04:41.980
That's not good enough,Larry.

04:42.050 --> 04:44.750
Unless you get some results,we're
going to get hit again.

04:44.810 --> 04:46.380
A lot of people are going to die

04:46.450 --> 04:47.710
if you don't find Dubaku.

04:47.780 --> 04:49.050
With all respect,sir,

04:49.110 --> 04:50.710
I don't need to be told what's at stake.

04:50.780 --> 04:52.410
We're giving everything we can.

04:52.480 --> 04:54.110
One of our agents has given her life.

04:54.180 --> 04:56.780
Yes,I was told about that.

04:56.850 --> 04:58.880
I'm... I'm sorry.

04:58.950 --> 05:00.710
I'll call you the minute we have something.

05:00.780 --> 05:02.780
We'll be waiting.

05:06.380 --> 05:08.310
God....

05:11.550 --> 05:14.810
The Matobos have been taken into a building.

05:14.880 --> 05:16.310
546 Adams.

05:16.380 --> 05:18.350
- Okay,pull up the stats on that address. - On it.

05:19.850 --> 05:21.650
It's the Ritter building,four stories high.

05:21.710 --> 05:23.210
The building is two years old.

05:23.280 --> 05:24.910
- Give me the security specs. - Give me a minute.

05:24.980 --> 05:27.480
We're coming up on it.

05:27.550 --> 05:30.480
I'm going to need your help.

05:53.450 --> 05:56.380
I see you've chosen a target.

05:56.450 --> 05:58.380
The Boyd Chemical Plant near Kidron,Ohio.

05:58.450 --> 06:01.110
The CIP device has enabled us

06:01.180 --> 06:02.980
to take control of the main tank.

06:03.050 --> 06:05.310
We're about to cause the
primary safety valves to fail.

06:12.550 --> 06:15.450
Do you remember the last
time we saw each other,Ule?

06:16.980 --> 06:20.050
It was at a state dinner in your residence.

06:20.110 --> 06:23.210
We shared an excellent bottle of wine.

06:23.280 --> 06:24.880
I offered my hand in friendship

06:24.950 --> 06:28.710
and you... slapped it away.

06:28.780 --> 06:30.650
You gave me an ultimatum...

06:30.710 --> 06:32.680
to be the puppet for your military.

06:32.750 --> 06:34.680
You could have had a long and prosperous career

06:34.750 --> 06:36.410
as prime minister.

06:36.480 --> 06:37.910
But now you're going back to Sangala

06:37.980 --> 06:39.180
as a traitor to your people.

06:39.250 --> 06:41.050
I am prime minister.

06:41.110 --> 06:42.880
I was elected by the people.

06:42.950 --> 06:44.810
It's you and Juma who are the traitors.

06:50.980 --> 06:52.550
No.

06:52.610 --> 06:54.710
We brought order to Sangala,

06:54.780 --> 06:56.880
but you are trying to destroy

06:56.950 --> 06:58.550
everything that we've built.

07:01.780 --> 07:04.750
You'll be taken back to Sangala,Ule,

07:04.810 --> 07:07.110
And you will give General Juma

07:07.180 --> 07:09.410
the names of all your fellow traitors.

07:09.480 --> 07:11.450
I will never do that.

07:11.510 --> 07:13.310
Never.

07:19.310 --> 07:21.450
Hmm...

07:21.510 --> 07:24.480
Believe me,you will.

07:26.310 --> 07:27.550
Take them.

07:33.810 --> 07:36.780
Any response from the president?

07:36.850 --> 07:38.510
Not yet.

07:38.580 --> 07:40.450
But once she sees dead Americans

07:40.510 --> 07:43.710
lying in the street,she will be less stubborn.

07:56.030 --> 07:58.060
I'm inside,Jack,approaching the front desk.

07:58.070 --> 08:00.010
Copy that.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.010
Are the Motobos still on the third floor?

08:04.045 --> 08:05.050
Affirmative,Jack.

08:05.060 --> 08:07.050
They're being moved. I'm just not sure where yet.

08:07.085 --> 08:08.060
Copy that.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.050
Good afternoon.

08:18.060 --> 08:20.040
I'm Agent Walker with the FBI.

08:20.050 --> 08:22.040
I don't have an appointment.

08:22.050 --> 08:24.015
But I'm here to see Mr.
Roane of Roane and associates.

08:24.050 --> 08:26.060
- I'll let them know you're here.
- Actually,I don't want to be announced.

08:26.070 --> 08:28.010
I'm here on official business.

08:28.020 --> 08:29.005
All right.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.080
So as far as you're concerned.

08:30.090 --> 08:32.090
I was never here,understand?

08:33.000 --> 08:34.090
Yes,ma'am.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.049
Past security.

08:39.059 --> 08:40.975
Heading toward the elevator.

08:41.010 --> 08:43.080
We're on our way to the service entrance.

08:54.020 --> 08:55.555
Chloe,I'm on the third floor.

08:55.590 --> 08:57.090
Law firm is on your left.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.020
On your right is a suite of offices where Matobo's

09:00.055 --> 09:01.030
being held.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.050
I see it.

09:02.060 --> 09:04.060
Stairwell's down the hallway to your left.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.070
Agent Walker,we're at the door.

09:31.050 --> 09:34.040
There's one guard outside
the suite,probably armed.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.020
Bill,take the third floor.

09:42.055 --> 09:43.040
Wait for my signal.

09:47.060 --> 09:49.030
Go on.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.995
Chloe,we're on the fourth floor.

10:04.030 --> 10:05.090
In what used to be the computer room.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
- What now? - In the center of the room.

10:08.035 --> 10:09.070
There are two removable panels.

10:09.080 --> 10:11.050
This should give you access to the crawlspace.

10:11.085 --> 10:13.020
Copy that.

10:27.050 --> 10:29.060
Okay,we're clear. Let's go.

10:49.040 --> 10:50.040
We're in.

11:02.030 --> 11:04.080
I should never have allowed you to come with me.

11:04.090 --> 11:06.080
It was a mistake.

11:06.090 --> 11:09.040
It was not your decision,Ule.

11:12.020 --> 11:15.040
We will be all right.

11:15.050 --> 11:18.060
Jack Bauer will be here soon.

11:23.040 --> 11:25.040
Okay.

11:25.050 --> 11:26.070
We're at the heating unit.

11:26.105 --> 11:27.090
Okay,Jack,there's an airduct

11:28.000 --> 11:29.050
leading off that unit. Do you see it?

11:29.060 --> 11:31.020
Yeah.

11:31.030 --> 11:33.010
Follow that for about 30 yards

11:33.020 --> 11:34.050
until you see an electrical junction.

11:34.060 --> 11:36.050
Make a left,then another 20 yards

11:36.060 --> 11:37.070
you'll come to the vent.

11:37.080 --> 11:40.020
This will give you a view of the entire floor.

11:40.030 --> 11:41.040
And the Matobos?

11:41.050 --> 11:43.060
They've been moved into a adjacent room.

11:43.070 --> 11:44.070
Just off the main area.

11:44.080 --> 11:45.090
Okay,copy that.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.995
Come on.

11:48.030 --> 11:50.070
The entire NSA has been combing the firewall.

11:50.080 --> 11:52.060
Searching for the next CIP device breach.

11:52.095 --> 11:54.040
If this were something,don't you think

11:54.050 --> 11:55.050
They'd already know about it?

11:55.060 --> 11:57.030
I can live without your negativity today,Sean.

11:59.030 --> 12:01.040
There it is again,that same code fragment.

12:03.040 --> 12:06.000
"Kidron,Ohio." What's in Kidron,Ohio?

12:06.010 --> 12:07.010
Any sensitive installations?

12:07.020 --> 12:08.030
Something Dubaku might want to hit?

12:08.040 --> 12:09.030
I don't know.

12:09.040 --> 12:10.975
Homeland has a high-value

12:11.010 --> 12:13.040
target database. I'm cross-checking it now.

12:14.090 --> 12:17.055
Okay. Okay,nothing in Kidron itself.

12:17.090 --> 12:20.020
But in the neighboring county there's...

12:20.030 --> 12:21.080
- Boyd chemical.
- Boyd chemical. What do they make?

12:21.090 --> 12:23.070
Insecticide. Please get me that number.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.020
Hello?

12:32.030 --> 12:34.070
This is Janis Gold at FBI. I need to speak

12:34.080 --> 12:37.090
to your plant manager immediately,please.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.010
Ma'am,as I just stated I'm with the FBI.

12:40.020 --> 12:43.020
Does that sound vaguely important to you?

12:43.055 --> 12:45.010
Now,connect me to John Brunner.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.030
FBI? Uh,yeah,put her on.

12:54.030 --> 12:55.080
This is John Brunner.

12:55.115 --> 12:56.080
Hello.

12:56.090 --> 12:58.090
Mr. Brunner,this is Janis Gold,FBI

12:59.050 --> 13:00.110
D.C. Bureau.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.380
What can I do for you?

13:01.450 --> 13:02.850
We've been tracking some possible

13:02.910 --> 13:04.050
Breaches in the government firewall.

13:04.110 --> 13:06.550
The firewall's designed to protect installations

13:06.610 --> 13:08.210
- Like yours... - I know what it does,honey.

13:08.280 --> 13:10.210
Um,we have tracked

13:10.280 --> 13:12.180
And isolated one of these breaches

13:12.250 --> 13:13.350
In the Kidron area.

13:13.410 --> 13:14.980
I need to know are you experiencing

13:15.050 --> 13:16.510
Any problems right now?

13:16.580 --> 13:18.780
As a matter of fact,we're
dealing with one right now.

13:18.850 --> 13:21.510
- What is it?
- Three of our safety valves just failed

13:21.580 --> 13:23.210
On the primary storage tank.

13:23.280 --> 13:24.710
We're having trouble resetting them.

13:24.810 --> 13:27.210
- What's in that tank? - Methyl isocyanate.

13:27.280 --> 13:29.710
It's concentrated insecticide,highly toxic.

13:29.780 --> 13:31.480
Can you... what the hell is this all about?

13:32.810 --> 13:35.150
Mr. Brunner,I have reason

13:35.210 --> 13:36.480
To believe that this is a terrorist attack

13:36.550 --> 13:38.710
On your facility.

13:38.780 --> 13:40.010
Terrorist attack?

13:40.080 --> 13:41.450
Yes,sir,I need you to initiate

13:41.510 --> 13:42.880
On-site emergency procedures

13:42.950 --> 13:44.110
And stay on this line.

13:45.310 --> 13:46.350
Shut down the tank.

13:46.410 --> 13:47.880
- What's going on? - Do it! Do it!

13:47.950 --> 13:48.980
My authority.

13:51.410 --> 13:53.310
- Damn. - What is it?

13:53.380 --> 13:55.380
- It's not responding.
- What do you mean? Try it again.

13:57.180 --> 13:58.410
Nothing.

14:01.610 --> 14:04.150
Pressure in the primary tank is rising.

14:06.080 --> 14:08.480
- Son of a bitch. - Mr. Brunner?

14:08.550 --> 14:10.650
We cannot shut down the primary tank

14:10.710 --> 14:12.450
And the pressure is building.

14:12.510 --> 14:14.510
If we cannot stop this,we are looking

14:14.580 --> 14:16.710
At atmospheric release.

14:16.780 --> 14:18.710
Okay.

14:18.780 --> 14:19.880
Get Larry.

14:19.950 --> 14:21.750
Dubaku has targeted that facility.

14:21.810 --> 14:23.310
We need to alert the president.

14:24.350 --> 14:28.510
Mr. Brunner,you need to
expel your people right now.

14:41.780 --> 14:44.110
All right,Agent Moss,keep me apprised.

14:44.180 --> 14:46.250
I'll speak to the president.

14:46.310 --> 14:47.680
I just received an interagency alert.

14:47.750 --> 14:50.050
The FBI just discovered Dubaku's next target.

14:50.110 --> 14:51.180
A chemical plant,yeah.

14:51.250 --> 14:53.080
I just got off the phone with Larry Moss.

14:53.150 --> 14:54.410
I need to brief the president.

14:54.480 --> 14:56.650
Has the first gentleman spoken with the president?

14:56.710 --> 14:58.310
Not yet.

14:58.380 --> 15:00.710
I talked to Agent Gedge 40 minutes ago.

15:00.780 --> 15:03.050
Mr. Taylor is the only person
who can talk the president

15:03.110 --> 15:04.750
Into withdrawing our troops in Sangala.

15:04.810 --> 15:06.680
And that is our best way to prevent this attack.

15:06.750 --> 15:07.910
I know we need him.

15:07.980 --> 15:09.380
I'm waiting for a call back.

15:09.450 --> 15:12.080
The middle section's still
bothering me; read it again.

15:12.150 --> 15:14.550
"Colonel Dubaku and the Juma regime have killed

15:14.610 --> 15:16.450
"countless thousands of their own people,

15:16.510 --> 15:18.310
"and now hundreds of our fellow citizens.

15:18.380 --> 15:21.310
They deserve your prayers and your outrage."

15:21.380 --> 15:23.110
I think the word "outrage" might be too strong

15:23.180 --> 15:24.710
If you're trying to convey

15:24.780 --> 15:25.850
Calm authority.

15:25.910 --> 15:27.350
"outrage" is the only word

15:27.410 --> 15:29.250
To describe how I'm feeling,and how every person

15:29.310 --> 15:30.580
In this country will be feeling.

15:30.650 --> 15:32.350
The American people deserve the truth.

15:32.410 --> 15:35.250
Dubaku's already killed 300 Americans.

15:35.310 --> 15:37.610
God knows what else he has planned.

15:38.910 --> 15:40.050
Come in.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.080
Could you excuse us,Angela?

15:51.780 --> 15:53.280
What is it?

15:53.350 --> 15:55.250
The FBI believes they've detected

15:55.310 --> 15:56.450
Where the next attack will take place.

15:58.810 --> 16:01.250
Dubaku's infiltrated a chemical plant

16:01.310 --> 16:02.810
Just outside of Kidron,Ohio.

16:02.880 --> 16:04.980
He's causing the pressure on the facility's

16:05.050 --> 16:06.480
Primary tank to go critical.

16:06.550 --> 16:09.080
If the tank erupts,over 3,000 gallons

16:09.150 --> 16:11.180
Of methyl isocyanate will be
released into the atmosphere.

16:11.250 --> 16:13.250
Given the prevailing winds,

16:13.310 --> 16:15.680
A very large,very toxic cloud

16:15.750 --> 16:17.010
Will sweep into town.

16:17.080 --> 16:18.750
Methyl isocyanate

16:18.810 --> 16:20.380
is a concentrated insecticide.

16:20.450 --> 16:22.780
Even brief exposure causes severe lung damage

16:22.850 --> 16:24.780
and chemical burns of the skin.

16:24.850 --> 16:26.310
What's our time frame?

16:26.380 --> 16:28.080
The tank could rupture in less than 15 minutes.

16:28.150 --> 16:29.810
They've begun evacuating?

16:29.880 --> 16:31.650
We've already contacted emergency responders

16:31.710 --> 16:32.950
on the ground in Kidron.

16:33.010 --> 16:34.580
It's just not enough time to get everyone out.

16:34.650 --> 16:38.750
Kidron's population's just over 30,000.

16:40.010 --> 16:41.510
This projection says that

16:41.580 --> 16:43.410
we could lose over 50%?

16:47.610 --> 16:48.780
Oh,dear lord...

16:48.850 --> 16:51.710
Right now,our only chance of stopping this

16:51.780 --> 16:54.550
is finding Dubaku and the CIP device.

17:01.550 --> 17:03.210
- You ready? - Yeah.

17:03.280 --> 17:05.050
Quietly.

17:05.109 --> 17:06.380
Jack,I just intercepted

17:06.450 --> 17:09.349
an FBI alert identifying Dubaku's next target.

17:09.410 --> 17:11.079
A chemical plant near Kidron,Ohio,

17:11.150 --> 17:13.150
12 minutes from going critical. There are 30,000

17:13.210 --> 17:15.450
people in that town,Jack. We have to hurry.

17:15.510 --> 17:17.150
We'll do as fast as we can.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.050
Give me the scope out of the bag.

17:39.080 --> 17:40.950
Turning scope over to night-vision.

17:44.380 --> 17:46.010
I don't see Dubaku.

17:47.750 --> 17:50.050
We've got Nichols.

17:50.110 --> 17:51.980
Three men with automatic weapons.

17:52.050 --> 17:54.680
Three more over at the control
station,most likely armed.

17:54.750 --> 17:56.410
Copy that.

17:58.450 --> 17:59.910
That's Dubaku.

18:01.210 --> 18:02.210
We got Dubaku.

18:02.280 --> 18:03.610
Chloe,are you seeing this?

18:03.680 --> 18:06.180
Yes. The control station looks like an S-DART

18:06.250 --> 18:07.550
It's a really powerful processor.

18:07.610 --> 18:10.350
- It could be driving the CIP device. - Copy.

18:10.410 --> 18:12.780
NSA's classified infrastructure team

18:12.850 --> 18:15.250
- is trying to plug the firewall breach.
- Any luck so far?

18:15.310 --> 18:17.350
- None so far,but they're staying on it.
- They have less than

18:17.410 --> 18:18.880
- ten minutes left. - They're aware of that,sir,

18:18.950 --> 18:20.710
but they're doing what they can.

18:20.780 --> 18:21.880
Not now.

18:21.950 --> 18:23.110
What's going on at the plant?

18:23.180 --> 18:24.250
I'm on with them now.

18:24.310 --> 18:27.610
John? Did you try

18:27.680 --> 18:29.350
flashing the memory cards?

18:29.410 --> 18:30.780
Three times,honey.

18:30.850 --> 18:32.850
We're not in control of the computer system.

18:32.910 --> 18:35.280
I've already told my people
to get the hell out of here.

18:35.350 --> 18:36.880
Normally,I don't allow people

18:36.950 --> 18:38.980
to call me "honey," but we can discuss that later.

18:39.050 --> 18:41.850
Yeah,well,it sounds like you need to lighten up.

18:41.910 --> 18:43.450
Good,good.

18:43.510 --> 18:45.880
I'm heading to the primary tank room.

18:45.950 --> 18:47.950
I'm going to try to manually

18:48.010 --> 18:49.080
release some of the pressure.

18:49.150 --> 18:50.380
That's not going to stop it.

18:50.450 --> 18:52.610
No,but it might buy us

18:52.680 --> 18:55.310
a few more minutes so people can evacuate.

18:55.380 --> 18:57.650
I've got a thousand workers at this facility.

18:57.710 --> 18:59.750
And I am responsible

18:59.810 --> 19:01.910
for their safety.

19:01.980 --> 19:04.480
Now look,I need you to stay on the phone.

19:04.550 --> 19:06.450
- I'm going to need some help. - Absolutely.

19:06.510 --> 19:08.310
- What can I do? - I don't have access

19:08.380 --> 19:10.350
to the override schematics.

19:10.410 --> 19:11.650
See if you can pull up

19:11.710 --> 19:13.650
the operating procedures for tank one.

19:13.710 --> 19:16.280
Yeah,yeah,yeah. I got it.

19:16.350 --> 19:18.280
- I got it right here. - All right.

19:18.350 --> 19:20.350
Now look for the emergency valve

19:20.410 --> 19:22.280
release sequence.

19:22.350 --> 19:23.810
Okay.

19:23.880 --> 19:25.950
Uh,valve release. I have it right here.

19:27.880 --> 19:29.250
What i need you to do is...

19:29.880 --> 19:32.210
This,wait,this procedure is going

19:32.280 --> 19:34.550
to release the chemical right

19:34.610 --> 19:36.710
into the primary tank room
where you are right now.

19:36.780 --> 19:37.950
I know that.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.680
I have respiratory gear on.

19:39.750 --> 19:42.010
I'll be okay,just give me the sequence.

19:43.510 --> 19:45.180
But how long will that protect you?

19:45.250 --> 19:46.810
Don't worry about it,honey.

19:48.250 --> 19:50.850
Uh,okay.

19:50.910 --> 19:53.450
- Are you looking at the routing board? - I am.

19:53.510 --> 19:54.810
Go ahead.

19:54.880 --> 19:56.850
Set the bus switches

19:56.910 --> 20:00.180
To this sequence from left to right.

20:00.250 --> 20:01.310
Two. Two.

20:02.280 --> 20:03.410
Eight. Eight.

20:03.480 --> 20:05.450
Seven. Seven.

20:05.510 --> 20:06.750
Four. Four.

20:06.810 --> 20:08.580
Three. Three.

20:09.650 --> 20:10.910
Done.

20:10.980 --> 20:12.850
The secondary flow valve

20:12.910 --> 20:15.550
Should be behind you and to your right.

20:15.610 --> 20:18.410
I need you to turn that clockwise please.

20:26.310 --> 20:29.210
All right. All right,I got it.

20:29.280 --> 20:31.680
Okay,that's one valve down,

20:31.750 --> 20:32.910
Three more to go.

20:45.110 --> 20:47.810
Pressure inside the tank is approaching 400 psi.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.510
How long before the tank ruptures?

20:49.580 --> 20:51.080
Seven minutes.

20:51.150 --> 20:52.280
We've got a problem.

20:52.350 --> 20:54.050
- What is it? - An alert.

20:54.110 --> 20:56.310
Our hidden surveillance camera on the roof.

20:56.380 --> 20:58.650
Almeida and Bauer.

20:58.710 --> 20:59.910
When was this taken?

20:59.980 --> 21:01.250
20 minutes ago.

21:02.610 --> 21:04.310
I thought you killed Almeida and Bauer?

21:04.380 --> 21:06.280
Damn it! You said this location

21:06.350 --> 21:07.880
- Was kept secret from everyone! - It was.

21:07.950 --> 21:09.450
Then what are they doing here?!

21:09.510 --> 21:10.910
- I don't know. - How did they find us?!

21:10.980 --> 21:12.080
I don't know!

21:12.150 --> 21:13.750
600 psi and rising.

21:18.980 --> 21:21.150
Disengage the CIP module.

21:21.210 --> 21:22.210
Begin the offload.

21:25.810 --> 21:28.080
What are you doing? We're almost there.

21:28.150 --> 21:30.880
We will continue this
attack from another location.

21:33.110 --> 21:34.380
Let's finish this.

21:34.450 --> 21:35.450
We can handle them.

21:35.510 --> 21:37.310
We need to get out of here now.

21:37.380 --> 21:41.050
The CIP module's disengaged,starting off load.

21:41.110 --> 21:42.910
Hey,what the hell is that?

21:42.980 --> 21:44.380
What the hell is that?!

21:44.450 --> 21:45.910
What's the matter?

21:47.350 --> 21:50.510
The firewall breach just closed.

21:50.580 --> 21:52.510
What?!

21:52.580 --> 21:53.680
What are you talking about?

21:53.750 --> 21:56.580
No CIP intrusion,the firewall is secure.

21:56.650 --> 21:58.950
How? NSA?

21:59.010 --> 22:00.210
I don't know.

22:00.280 --> 22:01.450
Bring the CIP module.

22:02.510 --> 22:03.780
Get Motobo and his wife!

22:05.410 --> 22:06.750
Bill,we should go

22:06.810 --> 22:08.180
With the second option on the assault.

22:08.250 --> 22:10.650
Two-prong attack. You and Tony
come through the main entrance.

22:10.710 --> 22:12.110
- We'll go in from here. - Copy.

22:12.180 --> 22:15.110
Give me the C4 out of the bag.

22:39.480 --> 22:40.550
Go!

22:48.410 --> 22:49.410
Move.

22:50.610 --> 22:51.850
Move!

23:13.950 --> 23:15.510
Get the CIP device!

23:29.380 --> 23:30.610
Clear!

23:34.450 --> 23:36.450
All clear over here! Get Dubaku?

23:36.510 --> 23:37.910
Negative!

23:40.450 --> 23:42.210
Jack,I've got the CIP device.

23:42.280 --> 23:43.950
It's been destroyed.

23:44.010 --> 23:46.080
Jack,it's Renee. The Motobos are safe.

23:46.150 --> 23:47.350
I'm taking them to the van.

23:47.410 --> 23:48.780
Copy that. I want you

23:48.850 --> 23:51.550
And Bill to do a sweep.
See if you can find Dubaku.

23:52.480 --> 23:53.950
I'll cover the south side.

24:05.200 --> 24:07.060
John? John,are you still there?

24:08.130 --> 24:10.200
Yeah.

24:10.260 --> 24:11.260
John,listen to me.

24:11.330 --> 24:12.500
The terrorists are out of the system.

24:12.560 --> 24:15.000
Please tell me what is happening right now.

24:19.160 --> 24:23.360
Automatic shutdown mode has kicked in.

24:23.430 --> 24:25.160
Pressure's dropping.

24:25.230 --> 24:28.560
I think we're gonna be all right.

24:28.630 --> 24:30.000
Okay,that's great.

24:30.060 --> 24:32.500
Now you... you gotta get out of there right now.

24:39.200 --> 24:40.560
John?

24:43.500 --> 24:45.260
I can't make the door...

24:45.330 --> 24:46.860
I'm sending the rescue team.

24:46.930 --> 24:48.200
A rescue team is on its way.

24:48.260 --> 24:49.860
John,please stay with me.

24:49.930 --> 24:51.660
Stay with me.

25:18.130 --> 25:19.060
Have they found Dubaku?

25:19.130 --> 25:20.560
Still searching.

25:20.630 --> 25:23.100
First responders are five minutes away,Jack.

25:23.160 --> 25:24.160
Copy that.

25:33.200 --> 25:34.530
Get up.

25:35.630 --> 25:38.630
I said get up!

25:55.900 --> 25:57.530
They're coming.

25:57.600 --> 26:00.360
Please don't make me do this.

26:00.430 --> 26:03.400
I will go to your home,Michael.

26:03.460 --> 26:05.360
I'll make you wife watch

26:05.430 --> 26:06.530
As I kill your daughter,

26:06.600 --> 26:07.760
And then I will kill her.

26:07.830 --> 26:09.660
So do as I ask.

26:09.730 --> 26:11.960
Save your family.

26:30.630 --> 26:32.360
Let me see your hands!

26:32.430 --> 26:33.800
It's Latham.

26:34.930 --> 26:36.100
Where's Dubaku?!

26:36.160 --> 26:37.400
I'm sorry.

26:40.960 --> 26:42.100
Cover!

26:48.700 --> 26:50.160
Tony! Bill!

26:50.230 --> 26:52.630
Yeah! You all right?

26:52.700 --> 26:54.030
Jack?

26:54.100 --> 26:55.960
Jack?

26:56.030 --> 26:58.630
Jack,can you hear me?

26:58.700 --> 26:59.760
Yeah,yeah,we're okay.

26:59.830 --> 27:00.760
What happened?

27:00.830 --> 27:03.500
Latham was wired with explosives.

27:03.560 --> 27:06.000
We still don't have Dubaku.

27:06.060 --> 27:07.060
What?

27:07.130 --> 27:09.060
The CIP device has been destroyed.

27:09.130 --> 27:10.830
I want you to stay with the Motobos.

27:10.900 --> 27:11.930
Make sure they're safe.

27:13.130 --> 27:14.500
Jack the police are almost here.

27:14.560 --> 27:16.830
If you get arrested,this entire
operation goes out the window.

27:16.900 --> 27:18.800
- You have to get out of there. - Copy that.

27:18.860 --> 27:21.330
He's gone. We need to get back to the safe house.

27:21.400 --> 27:22.930
Let's go.

27:35.060 --> 27:37.960
Sean,this says both NSA and homeland have no idea

27:38.030 --> 27:40.230
Why the breach at the Kidron plan was stopped.

27:40.300 --> 27:41.230
They're still looking.

27:41.300 --> 27:43.100
We're working on it here also.

27:43.160 --> 27:44.460
Janis is coordinating with
a digital forensics team

27:44.530 --> 27:45.800
That she sent over to the plant.

27:45.860 --> 27:47.960
This doesn't make any sense.

27:48.030 --> 27:49.930
Why... Why would Dubaku suddenly stop an attack

27:50.000 --> 27:52.330
When he was minutes away
from causing mass casualties?

27:52.400 --> 27:54.660
Maybe there was a malfunction in the CIP device.

27:54.730 --> 27:56.830
No,no,I don't want maybes,all
right? I want answers.

27:56.900 --> 27:58.300
We're doing everything we can,sir.

27:58.360 --> 28:00.600
That's not good enough right now,is it?!

28:00.660 --> 28:03.060
I don't know what else to tell you,sir.

28:03.130 --> 28:05.400
I know you're upset about Renee,

28:05.460 --> 28:08.160
But getting angry at me is not
going to make it go any faster.

28:08.230 --> 28:10.430
If you think I'm yelling
at you because of my history

28:10.500 --> 28:12.360
With agent Walker,you are mistaken.

28:12.430 --> 28:14.130
There are thousands of lives at stake here.

28:14.200 --> 28:15.360
That's what concerns me.

28:16.560 --> 28:18.930
Sorry,sir.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.460
I want you and Janis to work with NSA.

28:22.530 --> 28:25.330
Find out where that CIP device is being used.

28:25.400 --> 28:28.130
If we find the device,we find Dubaku.

28:42.030 --> 28:44.060
I appreciate the call. Thanks a lot.

28:44.130 --> 28:46.030
Janis,Larry wants you to interface with NSA.

28:46.100 --> 28:49.230
See if you can back-trace that
CIP code fragment to its source.

28:49.300 --> 28:50.860
I'll try.

28:50.930 --> 28:52.900
Who were you talking to?

28:52.960 --> 28:55.360
The head of the response team at the plant.

28:55.430 --> 28:56.800
What did he say?

28:56.860 --> 28:58.230
Facility's clean.

28:58.300 --> 29:00.460
A trace amount of the chemical
was released,but not enough

29:00.530 --> 29:02.330
To do any damage,and the site has been secured.

29:02.400 --> 29:03.500
That's good.

29:03.560 --> 29:04.860
What about the plant manager?

29:04.930 --> 29:06.130
John brunner.

29:06.200 --> 29:07.630
Is he okay?

29:07.700 --> 29:09.230
No.

29:09.300 --> 29:10.800
Will you do me a favor?

29:10.860 --> 29:12.130
It depends.

29:12.230 --> 29:14.000
I'd like to track down Mr. Brunner's family.

29:14.060 --> 29:15.330
I was the last one to speak with him,

29:15.400 --> 29:17.900
And I feel they should know how brave he was.

29:17.960 --> 29:19.200
I'll see what I can find.

29:19.260 --> 29:20.630
Thank you.

29:20.700 --> 29:23.400
Janis,before you start sending flowers,

29:23.460 --> 29:25.700
You need to find out where
that CIP device was being used.

29:26.700 --> 29:28.700
I know... I am on it.

29:46.130 --> 29:48.060
Cleanup crews are already on site

29:48.130 --> 29:50.160
and we're continuing our
evacuation of a one-mile radius

29:50.230 --> 29:51.530
around the chemical plant.

29:51.600 --> 29:52.800
Casualties?

29:52.860 --> 29:54.260
There was,in fact,one casualty,

29:54.330 --> 29:55.300
the plant manager.

29:55.360 --> 29:57.060
13 other workers are being treated

29:57.130 --> 29:59.500
for chemical burns and inhalation of toxic fumes.

29:59.560 --> 30:02.160
And there haven't been any
other intrusions in the firewall?

30:02.230 --> 30:03.930
No,ma'am.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.660
It appears the crisis has been averted.

30:05.730 --> 30:07.200
Except that no one's been able

30:07.260 --> 30:08.930
to explain how the firewall break disengaged.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.300
Not yet.

30:10.360 --> 30:13.000
The FBI has no idea how it
happened... It just happened.

30:13.060 --> 30:15.860
And that's not an explanation.

30:15.930 --> 30:17.700
Perhaps Dubaku was firing another warning shot.

30:17.760 --> 30:19.960
No,Dubaku's already down two planes.

30:20.030 --> 30:21.760
He's not afraid to take more lives.

30:21.830 --> 30:24.900
In any event,we should be grateful.

30:24.960 --> 30:27.360
I'm not one to accept good news

30:27.430 --> 30:29.130
unless I know where it comes from.

30:30.860 --> 30:33.500
Until we have more answers,I
want to maintain alert levels.

30:34.560 --> 30:35.730
Yes?

30:35.800 --> 30:38.200
Madam president,I have admiral Smith on line two.

30:38.260 --> 30:41.600
Put him through. Thank you,Tim.

30:41.660 --> 30:43.330
Admiral?

30:43.400 --> 30:47.800
I've been trying to reach agent
Gedge,and he hasn't picked up.

30:47.860 --> 30:50.260
Yes,I'm sure I have the right number.

30:50.330 --> 30:52.500
I just spoke to him over an hour ago.

30:52.560 --> 30:55.260
He said he was outside Samantha Roth's apartment

30:55.330 --> 30:56.800
waiting for the first gentleman.

30:56.860 --> 31:00.130
Just find him.

31:00.200 --> 31:04.160
I don't care who you have to pull off shift.

31:04.230 --> 31:05.600
Still can't reach Gedge.

31:05.660 --> 31:08.100
The secret service doesn't
know where he is either.

31:09.430 --> 31:12.660
I need to tell the president.

31:12.730 --> 31:13.930
Maybe you should hold off.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.630
The domestic threat's been lifted for now

31:15.700 --> 31:17.760
and she's on the phone with admiral Smith.

31:20.430 --> 31:22.800
I can't authorize the air strikes

31:22.860 --> 31:24.800
until our post-invasion plans are in place.

31:24.860 --> 31:29.130
Finding a politically viable
replacement,until that happens,

31:29.200 --> 31:32.530
you need to keep your forces at full readiness.

31:32.600 --> 31:35.060
The joint chiefs are getting impatient.

31:35.130 --> 31:39.060
Madam president,we need
to talk about your husband.

31:41.930 --> 31:44.460
His theory about your son's death,

31:44.530 --> 31:46.660
He hasn't let it go.

31:46.730 --> 31:49.330
What are you talking about?

31:49.400 --> 31:52.230
He's been harassing Roger's girlfriend,

31:52.300 --> 31:56.600
accusing her of complicity in the death of Roger.

31:56.660 --> 31:57.900
Henry and I went over it

31:57.960 --> 31:59.400
again and again with the FBI,

31:59.460 --> 32:00.460
and he swore to me

32:00.530 --> 32:02.760
he was past all that.

32:02.830 --> 32:04.900
Well,he's found a private
investigator who's feeding

32:04.960 --> 32:06.100
his conspiracy theory.

32:06.160 --> 32:08.160
Taking advantage of him.

32:10.260 --> 32:11.500
Please get henry on the phone.

32:11.560 --> 32:14.530
I'm afraid I can't do that.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.500
Henry's unreachable.

32:17.560 --> 32:20.600
I don't understand.

32:20.660 --> 32:23.100
Agent Gedge hasn't been answering his phone.

32:23.160 --> 32:26.860
Now,I wouldn't get too worried yet.

32:26.930 --> 32:30.330
You're telling me my husband's gone missing?

32:30.400 --> 32:34.530
Secret service has put out an APB.

32:34.600 --> 32:37.800
They're going to Ms. Roth's apartment.

32:37.860 --> 32:42.160
Whatever's going on,I will find out soon enough.

32:47.530 --> 32:51.200
This is a priority order
code Charlie zero Charlie.

32:51.260 --> 32:54.060
We need an immediate 20 on Agent Gedge.

32:54.130 --> 32:56.200
All available field agents proceed

32:56.260 --> 32:59.660
404 Wilkinson drive.

34:12.659 --> 34:13.929
You're making a mistake.

34:15.730 --> 34:16.830
Think about it.

34:16.900 --> 34:17.860
Shut up!

34:17.929 --> 34:18.900
You haven't killed anybody yet.

34:18.960 --> 34:20.199
You don't need to do this.

34:22.159 --> 34:24.900
Gedge's plan to frame me is already blown.

34:24.960 --> 34:27.330
If you kill me,

34:27.400 --> 34:29.429
they'll know it was murder,

34:29.500 --> 34:31.400
And they'll trace it back to you.

34:40.929 --> 34:42.300
Go ahead.

34:42.360 --> 34:44.860
Where's agent Gedge? I can't reach him.

34:44.929 --> 34:46.960
Gedge is dead.

34:47.030 --> 34:48.159
What happened?

34:48.230 --> 34:50.530
Everything was going according to plan...

34:50.600 --> 34:51.860
But something went wrong.

34:51.929 --> 34:54.000
Taylor killed Gedge; I don't know how.

34:55.159 --> 34:56.330
Where's Mr. Taylor now?

34:56.400 --> 34:57.700
He's right here.

34:57.760 --> 35:00.730
Don't kill him,bring him to me.

35:19.130 --> 35:21.330
Prime minister Matobo,ma'am,please come with me.

35:21.400 --> 35:24.500
Chloe,pull up the Ritter
building on a satellite grid.

35:24.560 --> 35:27.360
Look for any sign of Dubaku leaving the site.

35:27.460 --> 35:28.860
We've got to find him.

35:28.930 --> 35:31.230
It's going to take me 20
minutes to task the satellite.

35:31.300 --> 35:32.660
Then don't waste time talking about it.

35:32.730 --> 35:35.160
Pull up satellite and traffic cams,

35:35.230 --> 35:37.500
street corners and metro stations.

35:37.560 --> 35:39.400
What's the priority? I can
only do one thing at a time.

35:39.500 --> 35:41.030
- Satellite! - Fine.

35:41.100 --> 35:42.430
Bill,we need to rethink this.

35:42.530 --> 35:43.860
What do you mean?

35:43.930 --> 35:46.300
You were set up to surveil
an undercover operation.

35:46.360 --> 35:47.360
Your cover's been blown.

35:47.430 --> 35:48.760
The police are after us.

35:48.830 --> 35:51.560
We are not equipped to look for
one man in a city of millions.

35:51.630 --> 35:53.260
We need additional resources.

35:53.330 --> 35:54.430
What are you suggesting?

35:54.500 --> 35:56.660
It's time to contact outside agencies.

35:57.960 --> 36:00.000
- The government? - Yes.

36:00.060 --> 36:01.760
I thought you said the
government couldn't be trusted.

36:01.830 --> 36:02.900
Right now,we don't have a choice.

36:02.960 --> 36:03.930
It can't be trusted.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.100
We can't trust anybody,

36:05.160 --> 36:06.400
That's why we're working on the outside.

36:06.460 --> 36:08.300
President Taylor can be trusted.

36:08.360 --> 36:10.100
I'm not questioning that,prime minister.

36:10.160 --> 36:12.100
It's the people around her who can't be trusted.

36:12.160 --> 36:14.460
Mr. Buchanan,Jack's right. We need help.

36:14.530 --> 36:15.760
It's too dangerous.

36:15.830 --> 36:18.260
We can limit the flow of information.

36:18.330 --> 36:19.760
Prime minister Matobo can get us past

36:19.830 --> 36:22.000
The president's outer circle...
that way,we can at least

36:22.060 --> 36:23.260
explain to her why and what we're doing.

36:23.330 --> 36:24.330
I think Jack's right.

36:24.400 --> 36:26.200
We left a lot of clues in that building.

36:26.260 --> 36:27.460
We're vulnerable; we can't do this

36:27.530 --> 36:28.630
on our own anymore.

36:28.700 --> 36:30.700
Am I supposed to remain in hiding with you,

36:30.760 --> 36:32.100
Pretend that my wife and I

36:32.160 --> 36:34.060
are still being held hostage or dead?

36:36.260 --> 36:37.860
I need to return to the white house

36:37.930 --> 36:39.930
and help the president save
what's left of my country.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.500
Let my husband do this.

36:41.560 --> 36:43.460
Let him call president Taylor.

36:43.530 --> 36:45.560
She will listen to him.

36:49.930 --> 36:53.700
Bill,you want to find Dubaku,make the call.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.900
All right.

37:04.960 --> 37:06.260
Get me the white house.

37:11.530 --> 37:13.360
Representatives from Boyd Chemical

37:13.430 --> 37:14.960
have assured local authorities

37:15.030 --> 37:17.100
that the immediate crisis has passed.

37:17.160 --> 37:19.200
However,this has done little to calm the nerves

37:19.260 --> 37:22.030
of the citizens of Kidron,Ohio,

37:22.100 --> 37:25.700
many of whom have taken shelter
in neighboring communities.

37:25.760 --> 37:27.660
Again,we have confirmed one fatality

37:27.730 --> 37:29.030
inside the plant itself.

37:29.100 --> 37:31.160
13 others,all Boyd employees,

37:31.230 --> 37:32.930
are being treated at local medical centers...

37:33.000 --> 37:34.560
Yes?

37:34.630 --> 37:37.460
Madame president,I have prime
minister Matobo calling for you.

37:37.530 --> 37:38.500
Matobo?!

37:38.560 --> 37:39.500
Yes,ma'am.

37:39.560 --> 37:40.830
You're tracing it?

37:40.900 --> 37:43.330
We tried,madame president,but it's a secure line.

37:43.400 --> 37:45.130
Put him through.

37:46.160 --> 37:47.430
Prime minister?

37:47.500 --> 37:48.900
Yes,madame president.

37:48.960 --> 37:50.100
Are you all right?

37:50.160 --> 37:51.930
Thank God my wife and I are both fine.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
We were rescued.

37:53.060 --> 37:54.500
By whom?

37:54.560 --> 37:55.700
Where are you?

37:55.760 --> 37:57.360
In a safe place.

37:58.900 --> 38:01.630
Madame president,you need to listen to me.

38:01.700 --> 38:04.930
The people who rescued us,they
have acquired the CIP device.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.400
It has been destroyed,

38:06.460 --> 38:09.760
and your country is no
longer under immediate threat.

38:09.830 --> 38:13.060
Who are these people,and
tell me how this happened.

38:13.130 --> 38:15.200
I will tell you everything in person,

38:15.260 --> 38:17.460
But,uh,this must happen privately.

38:17.530 --> 38:18.660
I must speak to you alone.

38:18.730 --> 38:20.730
Why alone?

38:20.800 --> 38:23.600
They will bring me to you,Madame President.

38:23.660 --> 38:25.400
We will arrive in ten minutes.

38:25.460 --> 38:27.130
I'll be waiting for you.

38:28.660 --> 38:31.660
They tried to trace the call,but the line held.

38:34.600 --> 38:37.330
- Ethan,I need to see you right now.
- Be right there.

38:45.260 --> 38:46.560
Yes,Madame President?

38:46.630 --> 38:49.630
I just spoke to Prime Minister Matobo.

38:49.700 --> 38:51.360
What?!

38:51.430 --> 38:52.530
He's safe.

38:52.600 --> 38:54.130
How? What happened?

38:54.200 --> 38:56.130
He'll let us know when he gets here.

38:56.200 --> 38:58.030
He's on his way now. He wants a private meeting.

38:58.100 --> 39:00.260
Bring him in through the south entrance,

39:00.330 --> 39:02.460
and keep this to as few people as possible.

39:02.530 --> 39:04.530
All right.

39:09.500 --> 39:11.930
Jack,I've mapped a route
for you to the white house.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.030
It's mostly side streets,

39:13.100 --> 39:14.500
but there will be fewer traffic cams.

39:14.560 --> 39:16.160
Okay,good. Send it to my phone.

39:16.230 --> 39:17.600
We're ready. Let's go.

39:17.660 --> 39:20.060
As soon as we set the vehicle
in front of the building,

39:20.130 --> 39:21.600
Agent Walker will move Mr. Matobo.

39:21.660 --> 39:23.100
Jack... Jack!

39:23.160 --> 39:24.600
What?

39:24.660 --> 39:26.330
I'm not going.

39:28.260 --> 39:29.560
What are you talking about?

39:29.630 --> 39:31.330
If the government gets their hands on Tony,

39:31.400 --> 39:32.600
they'll arrest him.

39:32.660 --> 39:34.200
I already told you

39:34.260 --> 39:37.030
I did some pretty bad things
before I teamed up with Bill.

39:37.100 --> 39:39.160
Tony,take it from me...

39:39.230 --> 39:41.260
you need to deal with the consequences.

39:41.330 --> 39:43.060
And believe me,I will.

39:43.130 --> 39:44.960
But not yet. Not till we get Dubaku.

39:45.030 --> 39:46.430
I'm working on a lead.

39:46.500 --> 39:48.600
I've got a guy on Emerson¡¯s crew

39:48.660 --> 39:50.530
who might have some intel we can use.

39:50.600 --> 39:51.800
Let him do this,Jack.

39:51.860 --> 39:54.560
He's the reason we got this far.

39:56.600 --> 39:58.530
Fine.

39:58.600 --> 40:00.960
But you give me your word as soon as this as over,

40:01.030 --> 40:02.260
you turn yourself in.

40:02.330 --> 40:03.530
We'll stand behind you.

40:05.630 --> 40:07.660
All right,you have my word.

40:10.100 --> 40:12.330
Good luck. Be careful.

41:05.130 --> 41:06.200
- Hey. - Hey.

41:06.260 --> 41:08.100
I was on my way to work,so I thought

41:08.160 --> 41:09.230
I'd stop in and see you.

41:09.300 --> 41:10.930
I tried calling you earlier.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.400
I'm sorrym,I've been busy.

41:12.460 --> 41:14.560
Are you all right? You look exhausted.

41:14.630 --> 41:16.860
It's just been a long day.

41:16.930 --> 41:19.160
Well,I hope you're still coming over for dinner.

41:19.230 --> 41:20.860
I'm making lasagna.

41:20.930 --> 41:23.930
And my sister promises not to
give you any more dirty looks.

41:25.960 --> 41:27.260
You haven't forgotten,have you?

41:27.330 --> 41:28.760
No. No.

41:28.830 --> 41:30.930
It's just that I've got
some business to attend to.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.200
Samuel,you work too much.

41:33.260 --> 41:35.100
Every time you come into the diner,

41:35.160 --> 41:36.630
you're always on the phone.

41:36.700 --> 41:37.860
I have to,Maria,

41:37.930 --> 41:39.930
So that,one day,I can finally take you away

41:40.000 --> 41:41.560
from that awful place that you work in.

41:41.630 --> 41:43.630
Well,we met in that awful place.

41:43.700 --> 41:44.800
Don't forget that.

41:46.160 --> 41:48.060
- I'll see you later. - Okay.

42:03.160 --> 42:04.100
Go ahead.

42:04.160 --> 42:05.800
Have you got Mr. Taylor?

42:05.860 --> 42:08.000
Yes. I'm about three minutes away.

42:08.060 --> 42:11.000
There's a Korean grocer opposite my building.

42:11.060 --> 42:13.300
One of my men will meet you out back.

42:13.360 --> 42:14.500
Bring Taylor inside.

42:14.560 --> 42:16.660
What are you gonna do to him?

42:16.730 --> 42:19.000
Just make sure you weren't followed.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
