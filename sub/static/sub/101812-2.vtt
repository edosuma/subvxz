00:14.515 --> 00:15.983
MAN:
Hello.

00:21.155 --> 00:24.091
Let's get down to
business, shall we?

00:24.125 --> 00:28.829
You arranged a meeting
so you could make a deal.

00:28.861 --> 00:30.864
Yes?

00:32.332 --> 00:33.533
My people are willing to pay...

00:33.567 --> 00:35.103
Your people?

00:35.136 --> 00:38.338
You mean...
the British government?

00:40.207 --> 00:41.341
You think I'm MI6?

00:41.375 --> 00:44.978
Of course, Ms. Meyers.

00:45.012 --> 00:47.515
Did you think...

00:47.548 --> 00:50.518
I wouldn't find out? Hmm?

00:50.551 --> 00:53.521
Look, I don't know
who you've talked to,

00:53.554 --> 00:56.856
but I'm not SIS.

00:56.890 --> 01:00.060
My boss is willing to pay
a small fortune for that vial.

01:00.094 --> 01:03.131
If we can't do business,
then you can put that...

01:06.433 --> 01:08.102
I'm afraid

01:08.135 --> 01:10.003
I can't let you go.

01:16.210 --> 01:18.146
Do you really think you're
gonna get away with this?

01:18.179 --> 01:22.049
I think our conversation
is over.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.554
Danke.

01:26.587 --> 01:30.557
Well, if you don't mind,
uh, we'd like to make a--

01:30.591 --> 01:32.593
how do you say in English?--
uh...

01:32.626 --> 01:37.331
an instructional video
for our real buyers.

01:37.365 --> 01:39.599
A sort of how-to guide,

01:39.633 --> 01:43.103
with a bit of before
and after.

01:49.176 --> 01:51.311
Prost.

01:57.551 --> 01:59.552
(breathing heavily)

02:01.021 --> 02:01.688
(gasping)

02:01.721 --> 02:04.224
(coughing)

02:19.139 --> 02:21.140
*

02:40.060 --> 02:41.628
*

02:51.239 --> 02:52.639
(indistinct chatter nearby)

03:12.960 --> 03:14.594
*

03:16.997 --> 03:18.431
(tires screeching)

03:26.407 --> 03:29.443
(horns honking)

03:29.477 --> 03:30.943
(tires screeching)

03:30.978 --> 03:32.211
(horn honks)

03:44.324 --> 03:46.058
(sighs)

03:46.093 --> 03:48.094
(phone ringing)

03:52.098 --> 03:54.935
Hello? Hello?

03:55.703 --> 03:57.271
(doorbell rings)

04:04.677 --> 04:06.979
(doorbell rings)

04:09.248 --> 04:11.352
(laptop beeping)

04:11.384 --> 04:12.552
Her phone's in the house.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.288
She's in there.

04:32.805 --> 04:35.643
*

04:41.348 --> 04:43.750
(quietly):
Riley, call her phone again.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.120
(phone ringing)

04:53.394 --> 04:54.562
(grunting)

04:56.463 --> 04:58.331
What was that?

04:58.365 --> 05:00.266
C-4, armed with
a mercury switch.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.536
Move a muscle,
it'll blow your hand off.

05:02.569 --> 05:04.338
I'm calling the cops.
I wouldn't do that.

05:04.372 --> 05:05.738
We own your phone. Also,

05:05.773 --> 05:09.076
that hidden security camera
in your speaker over there

05:09.108 --> 05:09.942
is being monitored as well.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.644
Oh, and not to be a snob
or anything,

05:11.678 --> 05:15.081
but a mercury switch has to be
stable before it's activated,

05:15.115 --> 05:16.417
and the way you threw it
in my hand

05:16.449 --> 05:17.785
would have blown
this whole house up.

05:17.817 --> 05:20.553
Sorry, I didn't know I was
dealing with the Geek Squad.

05:20.588 --> 05:23.824
And C-4 has a density of
1.7 grams per cubic centimeter.

05:23.856 --> 05:26.427
So, whatever's in my hand
is far too heavy,

05:26.459 --> 05:27.627
meaning it's a...

05:27.661 --> 05:30.398
My grandmother had
this exact same one...

05:30.430 --> 05:31.699
(pained groan)

05:31.731 --> 05:32.699
Who are you?

05:32.733 --> 05:34.634
I need you to come with me.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.836
Give me one reason why
I should listen to you.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.805
How about $60 million?

05:38.838 --> 05:40.641
The estimated value

05:40.673 --> 05:42.308
of the Matisse painting
you stole

05:42.341 --> 05:44.177
prior to retiring
seven years ago.

05:44.211 --> 05:45.478
I don't know
what you're talking about.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.715
Your name is Jess Miller.

05:47.747 --> 05:50.149
Your parents died
when you were six.

05:50.182 --> 05:53.653
You were adopted by your
grandparents, Edward and Anne.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.723
You did a brief stint on the
U.S. Olympics gymnastics team.

05:56.757 --> 05:59.726
You placed eighth in the
final event, and the loss

05:59.759 --> 06:01.795
forced you
to hang up your tights

06:01.829 --> 06:03.797
and turn your attention
to another career...

06:03.831 --> 06:05.298
as a cat burglar.

06:06.699 --> 06:07.834
You want me to go on?

06:10.603 --> 06:12.639
Who the hell are you?

06:14.475 --> 06:17.244
*

06:18.745 --> 06:20.312
MATTY:
Ms. Miller.

06:21.514 --> 06:23.350
I see you met
MacGyver and Riley.

06:23.382 --> 06:24.584
I'm Matilda Webber.

06:24.617 --> 06:25.752
This is Desi.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.220
I'm Russ Taylor,

06:27.254 --> 06:28.387
owner of this operation.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.358
You're wondering
why you're here.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.725
It's crossed my mind.

06:35.428 --> 06:37.430
This photograph
was taken

06:37.465 --> 06:39.567
eight years ago
from a surveillance camera

06:39.600 --> 06:40.701
at Lancaster Oil.

06:40.733 --> 06:43.235
A painting was stolen

06:43.269 --> 06:44.904
from the CEO's office, a Monet,

06:44.937 --> 06:47.507
worth approximately $10 million.

06:47.540 --> 06:49.242
Do you recognize this place?

06:50.276 --> 06:51.310
No?

06:51.343 --> 06:52.812
How about this?

06:55.649 --> 06:59.185
I'm not sure what this is about.
I'm a third grade teacher.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.622
These photographs are
all the authorities had

07:02.656 --> 07:04.824
to go on back then,
'cause no technology existed

07:04.858 --> 07:06.759
allowing them
to see through the disguise.

07:06.793 --> 07:08.562
So the investigation
closed quickly.

07:08.596 --> 07:09.862
RILEY:
That was

07:09.896 --> 07:11.363
technology before.

07:11.398 --> 07:12.766
But now...

07:12.800 --> 07:15.367
Pose Invariant
Person Recognition

07:15.401 --> 07:16.536
allows us to I.D.

07:16.569 --> 07:18.271
gait and body profile.

07:18.305 --> 07:19.473
So, once we get that...

07:23.776 --> 07:26.245
TAYLOR:
Surprisingly calm
for a 60-story fall.

07:26.278 --> 07:27.814
I'd hate to see my face
during a base jump.

07:27.848 --> 07:29.750
If this is
about taking me to court

07:29.783 --> 07:31.283
with this little magic
trick, you'll have

07:31.317 --> 07:32.552
better luck winning
the California State Lottery.

07:32.586 --> 07:33.887
MATTY: Maybe, if we
hadn't then run DNA

07:33.920 --> 07:35.723
from one of the
unsolved crime scenes

07:35.755 --> 07:37.790
that fit your profile.

07:37.824 --> 07:39.492
We got a match

07:39.526 --> 07:41.562
on a diamond theft
from a TL-30 safe

07:41.595 --> 07:44.264
with a biometric scanner.

07:45.966 --> 07:46.899
MacGYVER:
You cracked that?

07:46.933 --> 07:48.300
It's impressive.

07:48.334 --> 07:49.802
I want to call a lawyer.

07:49.836 --> 07:51.403
I'd find a good one
if I were you.

07:51.437 --> 07:53.206
See, what you
don't know

07:53.240 --> 07:55.675
is that Lancaster Oil
was a CIA front company.

07:55.709 --> 07:58.278
You broke into a government
facility, Ms. Miller.

07:58.310 --> 08:01.848
You committed a crime
against your country,

08:01.882 --> 08:04.752
and that's all the
government will look at.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.553
And I will make
sure of that...

08:06.586 --> 08:07.654
personally.

08:07.687 --> 08:08.922
You're blackmailing me?

08:08.956 --> 08:10.790
You have skills we need.

08:11.824 --> 08:14.226
I'm retired.

08:14.261 --> 08:15.896
I've had some...

08:15.928 --> 08:17.665
setbacks.

08:17.697 --> 08:19.231
Seven years ago.

08:19.266 --> 08:20.432
Lifting jewelry

08:20.466 --> 08:21.901
from the penthouse
of a six-story building,

08:21.935 --> 08:23.370
you miscalculated

08:23.403 --> 08:25.471
the height of the drop
for your descender rig,

08:25.504 --> 08:27.574
shattering your left leg
beyond repair.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.408
Still stuck the landing, though.

08:29.442 --> 08:31.511
Okay, how about we cut
to the chase, okay?

08:31.545 --> 08:34.514
Door number one has prison

08:34.548 --> 08:35.749
for the rest
of your life.

08:35.783 --> 08:37.684
Or door number two:

08:37.717 --> 08:39.586
accept the mission
I'm offering you.

08:47.727 --> 08:49.528
What's the job?

08:50.764 --> 08:52.465
TAYLOR:
About a month ago,

08:52.499 --> 08:55.335
a deadly
anthrax-based bioweapon,

08:55.368 --> 08:56.870
code-named Viro-486, was stolen

08:56.903 --> 08:59.038
from a chemical weapons facility
in Libya.

08:59.072 --> 09:01.774
It's so toxic that one
drop, if properly mixed

09:01.808 --> 09:04.476
in the airstream, can kill
anything in a 50-mile radius.

09:04.510 --> 09:06.379
MATTY:
As evidenced
in a dark deployment

09:06.413 --> 09:07.480
two years ago.

09:08.514 --> 09:11.751
TAYLOR: Civilian casualties
were well over 10,000.

09:13.352 --> 09:14.888
Hannibal Teague,

09:14.922 --> 09:17.591
German diplomat suspected
of brokering a deal

09:17.625 --> 09:18.892
to sell Viro-486

09:18.926 --> 09:20.827
to an anti-American
terrorist cell

09:20.860 --> 09:22.663
known as Black Sun.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.030
Have we identified a target yet?

09:24.063 --> 09:26.033
We have reason to believe
it's the climate summit

09:26.066 --> 09:27.533
at the United Nations
next month.

09:28.668 --> 09:29.702
If Black Sun
is successful,

09:29.736 --> 09:32.940
anything within a 15-mile radius
will be affected.

09:32.972 --> 09:35.408
23 million people dead.

09:36.375 --> 09:37.509
Give or take.

09:37.543 --> 09:39.011
How do you know
this guy Teague has it?

09:39.046 --> 09:40.880
All allied governments
have been looking
for this weapon

09:40.913 --> 09:42.349
for the past 18 months.

09:42.381 --> 09:45.052
MI6 tracked it down
to Teague's class TXTL-60

09:45.085 --> 09:46.519
high security
home safe.

09:46.552 --> 09:47.888
Sent someone to
retrieve it, and...

09:47.921 --> 09:51.323
sadly, the agent failed.

09:51.357 --> 09:52.893
We have reason to believe
that Teague used her

09:52.926 --> 09:55.461
as a guinea pig
to test the virus.

09:58.631 --> 10:00.332
MATTY:
Your job is to
steal the bioweapon

10:00.366 --> 10:02.669
before Teague has a chance
to make the transaction

10:02.702 --> 10:03.870
14 days from now.

10:03.903 --> 10:05.905
You understand I can't do
what I used to do.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.774
TAYLOR:
We're not asking you to.

10:07.807 --> 10:09.408
You're going to teach Desi.

10:10.811 --> 10:11.912
Whoa, wait.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.480
Trying to train
someone to do

10:13.513 --> 10:16.783
in under two weeks
what took me years to learn

10:16.817 --> 10:18.918
is a bad idea--
it's a very bad idea.

10:18.951 --> 10:21.922
Then let's not waste any
more time and get to work.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.090
Shall we?

10:26.393 --> 10:27.527
(door opens)

10:28.561 --> 10:29.562
(door closes)

10:36.736 --> 10:39.005
BOZER:
All right, right this way.

10:39.038 --> 10:42.375
Figured this would
come in handy.

10:42.408 --> 10:44.411
Blueprints.

10:44.443 --> 10:46.713
Teague's house is
20,000 square feet

10:46.746 --> 10:48.948
on five acres,
two stories with a basement.

10:48.981 --> 10:50.649
His office is
on the second floor.

10:50.683 --> 10:52.652
Well, what about the target?
I need box schematics.

10:52.686 --> 10:54.086
As ordered.

10:54.120 --> 10:57.423
Our intel says Teague keeps
his safe inside of a vault

10:57.456 --> 10:58.557
hidden in the walls

10:58.591 --> 10:59.558
of his office.

10:59.591 --> 11:02.495
A safe within a safe. Wonderful.

11:02.528 --> 11:03.931
What kind of steel
is the vault door?

11:03.964 --> 11:05.798
Pressurized titanium outer seal.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.033
Then it's German 385.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.769
Six plates,
one-and-a-half inch each.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.037
All those plates,

11:10.070 --> 11:11.504
it's gonna have
to be a burn job.

11:11.538 --> 11:13.505
That'll be quick, right?
'Cause I'm only gonna have

11:13.539 --> 11:14.707
30 seconds to get in.

11:14.741 --> 11:16.543
I'm sorry,
did you say "seconds"?

11:16.576 --> 11:18.010
MacGYVER:
Ultrasensitive
biometric sensor.

11:18.044 --> 11:20.013
Door has to be
opened in 30 seconds

11:20.047 --> 11:21.480
or the alarms trigger.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.049
The only way
to deactivate them is a panel

11:23.082 --> 11:25.684
on the other side
of the vault.

11:25.719 --> 11:26.886
It's virtually uncrackable.

11:26.919 --> 11:29.121
Everything is crackable.

11:29.789 --> 11:31.725
Room sensor configurations?

11:31.759 --> 11:32.993
No windows, armed skylight,

11:33.025 --> 11:35.763
doors are wired with traps,
and that's once you're outside.

11:35.796 --> 11:36.897
Once you're inside...

11:36.929 --> 11:38.030
BOZER:
Ten-point laser knot.

11:38.065 --> 11:40.133
Audio sensors
in every corner.

11:41.969 --> 11:43.635
Can it be done?

11:53.080 --> 11:56.482
With the right tools and...

11:56.515 --> 11:58.786
enough time to prepare...

12:01.288 --> 12:02.621
...yeah.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.625
I don't know about her.

12:06.658 --> 12:08.628
We've broken into safes before.

12:08.660 --> 12:11.130
TAYLOR:
Not like this.
This needs an expert.

12:11.163 --> 12:13.033
There's no margin for error.
Yeah,

12:13.066 --> 12:14.835
but your plan puts Desi at risk.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.202
TAYLOR:
A risk that needs
to be taken.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.937
Teague already has blood
on his hands.

12:17.971 --> 12:19.572
I won't let him have any more.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.710
There's more to this
than just getting that weapon.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.913
Did you know that MI6 agent?

12:26.947 --> 12:28.148
In passing.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.918
One of these days, you and I
are gonna play poker together,

12:30.951 --> 12:34.053
so I can take all of
that money of yours.

12:34.086 --> 12:37.090
The truth, now.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.928
Rebecca Meyers.

12:41.961 --> 12:45.664
I plucked her from the
Police Development Program.

12:45.697 --> 12:48.168
Smart, insightful.

12:48.201 --> 12:51.071
Had all the makings
of a top MI6 agent.

12:51.104 --> 12:54.807
I trained her.

12:54.841 --> 12:58.644
She called me her mentor.

12:58.677 --> 13:01.347
No one ever
called me that before.

13:01.380 --> 13:04.017
She was the most
promising agent

13:04.051 --> 13:06.285
I'd ever seen,

13:06.318 --> 13:09.089
and she was taken
from this world far too early.

13:09.121 --> 13:10.823
Her family deserves

13:10.857 --> 13:12.292
justice for her death.

13:12.325 --> 13:15.028
Rebecca deserves justice.

13:16.996 --> 13:20.033
The tightest section is in the
middle of the room, right there.

13:20.067 --> 13:22.701
Make it to here,
you're home free.

13:22.735 --> 13:23.971
Go.

13:24.004 --> 13:26.139
* Yes, no, maybe so

13:26.173 --> 13:28.240
* Like a rocket,
gonna blast off, watch me go *

13:28.274 --> 13:30.576
* Yin yang, say my name

13:30.610 --> 13:32.711
* Haters gonna hate, but I'm
hotter than the game, so, ha *

13:32.745 --> 13:34.581
* Hello, bye-bye,
everybody looking at me *

13:34.614 --> 13:36.850
* But I don't mind,
'cause dang straight *

13:36.884 --> 13:38.317
* Righteous as what...

13:38.350 --> 13:40.921
JESS:
The high-tech audio sensors
pick up everything,

13:40.953 --> 13:42.588
including breathing.

13:42.621 --> 13:44.756
One breath and it's all over.

13:44.790 --> 13:46.927
So you're gonna have
to learn to control that.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.696
* Check it out, come on, now

13:49.729 --> 13:51.597
* Come on, now, let's work

13:51.630 --> 13:53.765
* Come on, now

13:53.799 --> 13:55.869
* Come on, now, let's work

13:55.903 --> 13:57.169
* Fat stacks, buy me up

13:57.203 --> 13:59.639
* Thirsty for a dollar
and a lot of cheap luck *

13:59.672 --> 14:01.140
* Sweet sweat bustin' my chops

14:02.708 --> 14:05.278
* Come on, now, let's work

14:05.312 --> 14:07.246
* Come on, now

14:07.279 --> 14:08.948
* Come on, now, let's work,
check it out *

14:08.981 --> 14:12.985
* Come on, now, come on, now,
let's work, check it out *

14:13.019 --> 14:15.288
* Come on, now

14:15.322 --> 14:16.956
* Come on, now, let's work

14:16.990 --> 14:18.625
* Come on, now

14:18.658 --> 14:21.594
* Come on, now, let's work,
me, me... *

14:21.628 --> 14:23.263
JESS:
You can do this.

14:23.296 --> 14:24.630
It's just like ballet.

14:24.663 --> 14:25.899
Don't say that word.

14:25.932 --> 14:27.167
What's wrong with ballet?

14:27.200 --> 14:29.135
* Like your mommy...

14:29.168 --> 14:32.038
INSTRUCTOR:
Two, up, three, four,
port de bras forward.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.306
Two, up, six,

14:33.340 --> 14:35.042
seven, cambré back and...

14:35.075 --> 14:36.243
Desiree, roll through your feet.

14:36.275 --> 14:37.576
Engage your abs.

14:38.411 --> 14:39.611
Two, up, three.

14:39.645 --> 14:42.081
This is, like, the easiest move

14:42.115 --> 14:43.816
in the world.
(gasps)

14:43.850 --> 14:45.851
INSTRUCTOR:
Desiree!

14:47.354 --> 14:49.621
I don't do ballet.

14:49.655 --> 14:51.124
What do you think
the problem is?

14:51.158 --> 14:52.892
There's no feedback
on the strings,

14:52.926 --> 14:54.995
so when I make a mistake,
I just can't feel it.

14:56.196 --> 14:58.065
I have an idea.

14:58.097 --> 14:59.966
* Like a rocket, gonna
blast off, watch me go... *

15:00.000 --> 15:01.868
MacGYVER:
Electricity as a defense weapon

15:01.900 --> 15:04.937
had been postulated in fiction
by Jules Verne, Fanny Trollope,

15:04.971 --> 15:06.839
and Mark Twain.

15:06.873 --> 15:08.075
But it wasn't until 1928

15:08.107 --> 15:09.808
when New Zealand inventor
Bill Gallagher

15:09.841 --> 15:13.212
used the ignition magneto
to electrify a 5,000-volt fence

15:13.245 --> 15:16.082
to shock cattle when they tried
to leave the property.

15:16.115 --> 15:18.384
Once the cattle experience
these unpleasant consequences,

15:18.418 --> 15:19.885
they tend to avoid
the fence for good.

15:19.918 --> 15:21.854
Same principle can
apply to humans, too.

15:21.888 --> 15:23.855
Theoretically.

15:23.889 --> 15:25.125
DESI:
So let me
get this straight.

15:25.158 --> 15:27.793
I touch one of these strings
and I get zapped?

15:27.826 --> 15:31.197
It's just a little big stronger
than an electrified cow fence.

15:32.264 --> 15:33.399
Thank you.

15:33.432 --> 15:34.967
I think you just
lost your chances

15:35.001 --> 15:37.403
of ever dating that woman.

15:38.738 --> 15:41.140
Ready?

15:41.173 --> 15:43.275
* Come on, now, let's work

15:43.309 --> 15:45.745
* Come on, now

15:45.778 --> 15:47.379
* Come on, now, let's work
(electrical crackling)

15:47.413 --> 15:49.249
No, no, no. You're gonna need...

15:49.282 --> 15:51.317
You know what? I got this.

15:51.350 --> 15:52.851
* Come on, now

15:52.884 --> 15:54.254
* Come on, now, let's work...

15:54.287 --> 15:55.388
All right.

15:55.422 --> 15:57.124
You're in.

15:57.157 --> 15:58.924
Let's see what you got.

15:59.759 --> 16:01.827
DESI:
It's so cool.

16:01.860 --> 16:03.029
You'll be holding your
breath and moving.

16:03.062 --> 16:05.798
It's twice as hard, so I'm gonna
need you to beat a minute.

16:05.831 --> 16:06.932
Start again.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.067
(exhales)

16:08.100 --> 16:10.403
* 'Cause we ain't sweet
like your mommy *

16:10.437 --> 16:11.971
(inhales deeply)

16:16.143 --> 16:18.278
* Come on, now, let's work,
check it out *

16:18.311 --> 16:19.778
* Come on, now

16:19.812 --> 16:22.081
* Come on, now, let's work

16:22.115 --> 16:23.850
* Come on, now...

16:23.883 --> 16:26.253
Start again.
(exhales)

16:27.953 --> 16:30.389
Keep going.
(gasps)

16:36.462 --> 16:38.764
(laughs)

16:38.798 --> 16:39.432
Yeah.

16:39.466 --> 16:41.433
(laughs)
What?

16:41.467 --> 16:42.969
Now do it blindfolded.

16:43.001 --> 16:45.738
* Na, na, na, na, na

16:45.772 --> 16:48.140
* Na, na, na, na, na,
na, na, na, na, na... *

16:48.174 --> 16:49.375
What gives?

16:49.408 --> 16:53.113
Bang. You just got shot in the
head because you were too slow.

16:53.145 --> 16:55.081
Again.

16:55.115 --> 16:57.817
* Na, na, na, na, na.

17:04.423 --> 17:05.491
(electrical crackling)

17:07.960 --> 17:09.362
(phone beeps)

17:13.932 --> 17:15.835
Matty.

17:16.868 --> 17:18.438
You, uh, wanted to see us?

17:18.471 --> 17:19.506
How's the training going?

17:19.538 --> 17:20.839
Crushing it.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.509
Oh, she's making progress.

17:22.541 --> 17:25.178
Another week of 16-hour days
and she'll be halfway ready.

17:25.211 --> 17:26.778
MATTY:
Okay, let me ask you this:

17:26.813 --> 17:28.480
how good can you get
by tomorrow night?

17:29.481 --> 17:30.916
What?

17:30.950 --> 17:32.551
We just got intel Teague
is planning on moving

17:32.585 --> 17:34.554
the bioweapon ahead of schedule.

17:34.586 --> 17:36.489
Buyers must be
getting restless.
JESS:
Well,

17:36.522 --> 17:37.490
we'll get it from the buyer.

17:37.523 --> 17:38.724
Black Sun just won't sit on it.

17:38.758 --> 17:41.059
Once it's in their hands,
they'll deploy it within hours.

17:41.094 --> 17:42.229
MacGYVER:
Well, then we're gonna
have to improvise,

17:42.261 --> 17:44.063
because this plan
will never work.

17:44.096 --> 17:45.198
Desi isn't ready.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.333
TAYLOR:
Then you

17:46.365 --> 17:47.900
are going to Cyrano this thing.

17:47.933 --> 17:49.435
Talk Desi through
the grab.

17:49.469 --> 17:50.936
She isn't ready.

17:50.970 --> 17:52.070
She goes in now,

17:52.105 --> 17:53.205
it's not gonna work.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.473
MATTY:
Well, it's gonna have to work.

17:54.507 --> 17:58.211
Because if it doesn't, we're
gonna watch an entire city die.

18:08.587 --> 18:13.058
* I can feel it coming
in the air tonight *

18:13.092 --> 18:16.563
* Oh, Lord

18:16.596 --> 18:19.398
* I've been waiting
for this moment *

18:19.432 --> 18:23.035
* For all my life

18:23.068 --> 18:25.837
* Oh, Lord...

18:25.872 --> 18:26.873
(whistles)

18:26.905 --> 18:27.940
What's up?

18:27.973 --> 18:30.809
* Coming in the air tonight?

18:31.911 --> 18:34.046
* Oh, Lord...

18:34.079 --> 18:36.316
The next guard shift
is in ten minutes.

18:37.349 --> 18:39.117
How's it looking inside?

18:39.152 --> 18:41.052
Five thermals
on the first floor.

18:42.087 --> 18:43.355
Second floor is clear.

18:43.390 --> 18:44.891
All right, Desi,
you're green to go.

18:44.923 --> 18:46.526
* Oh, Lord...

18:51.597 --> 18:52.565
(exhales)

18:52.598 --> 18:54.366
Okay.
You can do this.

19:00.071 --> 19:03.108
* Oh, I remember

19:03.142 --> 19:07.012
* I remember, don't worry

19:07.046 --> 19:09.915
* How could I ever forget?

19:09.949 --> 19:12.951
* It's the first time

19:12.984 --> 19:14.186
* The last time...

19:14.221 --> 19:16.222
RILEY (over comm):
Desi, freeze. Incoming.

19:18.258 --> 19:19.892
(speaking German)

19:20.926 --> 19:23.563
Okay. You're clear.

19:23.596 --> 19:26.398
* I can feel it coming...

19:26.432 --> 19:28.099
In position.

19:29.134 --> 19:30.537
Riley, disarm the skylight.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.441
* I've been waiting
for this moment... *

19:34.473 --> 19:35.974
Disconnecting now.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.911
* All my life

19:38.944 --> 19:40.447
* Oh, Lord...

19:40.480 --> 19:41.448
Time to fly.

19:41.480 --> 19:45.116
* For all my life...

19:45.151 --> 19:46.252
(exhales)

19:47.720 --> 19:49.521
* Oh, Lord.

20:02.335 --> 20:03.435
TAYLOR:
Periphery check.

20:03.470 --> 20:05.605
MacGYVER:
All clear.

20:08.140 --> 20:09.576
JESS:
Nice landing.

20:09.608 --> 20:12.010
Now don't breathe.

20:30.162 --> 20:32.432
Your breath. Hold it.

20:32.464 --> 20:34.000
Hold it.

20:39.271 --> 20:40.272
You're clear.

20:42.240 --> 20:43.509
(sensor beeps)

20:43.542 --> 20:45.377
Okay, you got 30 seconds.

20:49.147 --> 20:51.584
Remember, you just have to cut
through the locking mechanism.

20:52.451 --> 20:55.054
Keep the beam thick.
It burns hotter.

20:56.221 --> 20:57.557
(clicks)

21:01.428 --> 21:02.494
Ten seconds.

21:02.528 --> 21:05.131
Do not breathe.

21:05.798 --> 21:06.798
(beeps)

21:08.067 --> 21:09.435
Two seconds.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.671
(beeping)

21:11.703 --> 21:15.007
(gasps)
Sensors are off.

21:15.040 --> 21:16.442
I'm in.

21:23.750 --> 21:26.452
Guys, I got a visual on Teague.

21:26.486 --> 21:28.454
Who's he talking to?

21:28.488 --> 21:31.490
Kind of hard to tell
from this angle.

21:31.523 --> 21:33.393
Mac, we need audio
on that conversation.

21:35.627 --> 21:37.329
Coming right up.

21:37.364 --> 21:38.631
When you can't get near
a terrorist

21:38.664 --> 21:40.467
having a shady conversation,

21:40.500 --> 21:43.102
you can always use light
to eavesdrop.

21:43.134 --> 21:45.037
Light reflects off glass,

21:45.070 --> 21:46.439
and the brightness
of the light changes

21:46.472 --> 21:48.307
because of tiny oscillations.

21:48.340 --> 21:51.076
These variations in brightness
will be converted to sound

21:51.109 --> 21:52.644
when the light
hits the photodiode.

21:52.679 --> 21:55.146
Then all you need
is to understand German,

21:55.181 --> 21:57.384
which, luckily, I do.

21:57.416 --> 21:58.384
Okay, guys,

21:58.417 --> 22:00.086
I can hear what he's saying.

22:00.118 --> 22:02.821
He says, "You're late."

22:02.855 --> 22:06.157
The other person's saying
something about the...

22:06.192 --> 22:08.361
chartered jet not being on time.

22:08.394 --> 22:10.596
"I want you to leave tonight."

22:10.630 --> 22:12.731
"Okay, I understand."

22:12.765 --> 22:14.534
Okay, that's it.

22:14.567 --> 22:16.335
W-We need to get a clear visual

22:16.368 --> 22:17.503
of whoever he's talking to.

22:17.537 --> 22:19.405
Unless he turns around
and says "cheese,"

22:19.439 --> 22:20.539
this is the best we got.

22:20.573 --> 22:22.375
We've got a whole bunch
of nothing.

22:23.375 --> 22:24.644
Almost there, Desi.

22:27.614 --> 22:29.682
(metallic clang)

22:32.818 --> 22:34.787
Are you guys seeing this?

22:34.820 --> 22:36.756
TAYLOR:
Yes.

22:36.788 --> 22:38.691
Yes, it's gone.

22:38.724 --> 22:40.125
(sighs)

22:40.159 --> 22:41.292
MATTY:
Well, either we got

22:41.326 --> 22:43.194
bad intel,
or Hannibal already sold it.

22:43.229 --> 22:45.131
Desi, get out of there.

22:45.163 --> 22:47.199
Copy that.

22:53.839 --> 22:55.642
(German accent):
Ja...

23:05.484 --> 23:06.885
Mac, you got three hostiles

23:06.919 --> 23:09.154
headed your way.

23:09.188 --> 23:11.557
They don't look like they
bought the accent, Johan.

23:11.590 --> 23:13.325
(speaking German)

23:14.359 --> 23:15.561
Riley, I need

23:15.595 --> 23:17.829
5,000 hertz of frequency
in my comm, stat.

23:20.467 --> 23:22.300
(high-pitched ringing)

23:22.334 --> 23:23.869
(guards groaning)

23:27.606 --> 23:29.842
Hey, guys, gate's compromised.

23:29.875 --> 23:32.310
We need a new exfil.
I got to get Desi.

23:32.344 --> 23:33.880
Right. We are on our way.

23:37.950 --> 23:39.151
(shouts)

23:41.721 --> 23:43.756
(gunfire continues)

23:44.891 --> 23:45.892
Mac, what's happening?

23:49.228 --> 23:50.395
Looks like you got me.

23:50.429 --> 23:51.631
(grunting)

23:53.766 --> 23:54.866
Change of plans.

23:54.901 --> 23:56.635
LZ is hot.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.740
(speaking German)

24:04.375 --> 24:05.978
(grunting)

24:07.880 --> 24:08.780
Hey.

24:08.815 --> 24:10.549
Hey.
(alarm blaring)

24:10.583 --> 24:12.519
We should get out of here.
Yeah.

24:12.551 --> 24:13.853
Hey, guys, where's
the new exfil?

24:13.885 --> 24:15.354
TAYLOR:
Back gate.

24:16.454 --> 24:18.490
There is no back gate.

24:22.662 --> 24:23.630
Oh.

24:23.663 --> 24:25.364
There it is.
Halt!

24:28.233 --> 24:30.537
Come on, get in. Hang on.

24:48.453 --> 24:51.356
Well, if it's not in the
vault, then where is it?

24:51.390 --> 24:54.661
Hannibal's kept his movements to
a minimum these last few weeks.

24:54.693 --> 24:56.461
And Black Sun
hasn't surfaced.

24:56.494 --> 24:58.897
So we can rule out the exchange
having already taken place.

24:58.931 --> 24:59.898
MATTY:
No.

24:59.932 --> 25:01.432
We can't be sure
about that.

25:01.467 --> 25:02.634
Well, then, let's hope.

25:02.669 --> 25:03.935
Look, need I remind you

25:03.970 --> 25:06.005
the destruction that
Viro-486 will cause

25:06.038 --> 25:07.506
if released into this world?

25:07.539 --> 25:09.808
Russ. We get it.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.844
We'll work up scenarios
and get back to you.

25:13.945 --> 25:15.847
(groans)

25:20.819 --> 25:22.788
You did good
back there.
No.

25:22.821 --> 25:24.289
You did.
Well,

25:24.323 --> 25:26.858
you got me through it,
so thank you.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.400
When I was in the service,

25:34.432 --> 25:36.702
I had a close friend
who lost a leg.

25:36.736 --> 25:39.971
And I know how much
it changed his life.

25:40.006 --> 25:42.374
You must have gone
through a lot.

25:42.407 --> 25:44.576
I respect you for that.

25:44.611 --> 25:47.846
Sometimes I think
it's my payback.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.548
Right? For all
those years stealing.

25:50.583 --> 25:53.451
But then I remember the world
doesn't work like that.

25:53.484 --> 25:54.721
I was dealt a hand,

25:54.753 --> 25:56.989
and now I play it
the best I can.

25:57.022 --> 25:59.325
So...

25:59.357 --> 26:00.558
can I go home now?

26:00.593 --> 26:01.928
TAYLOR:
Right, everyone.

26:01.961 --> 26:03.394
Gather round.

26:03.429 --> 26:04.563
(sighs)

26:04.596 --> 26:06.565
Sounds like a no.

26:08.334 --> 26:11.336
I was thinking about this, um,
this mystery guest of ours.

26:11.369 --> 26:13.505
You mean the guy
Teague was talking to?
DESI: I got to say,

26:13.538 --> 26:16.643
late-night visits,
talking about chartering planes.

26:16.675 --> 26:18.443
He wasn't just there
to visit an old friend.

26:18.477 --> 26:19.711
You think he was a mule?

26:19.746 --> 26:21.948
Perhaps.
Look, we need to find him,

26:21.980 --> 26:23.682
but we can't do that
without a clean visual of him.

26:23.715 --> 26:24.784
RILEY:
I got a reflection

26:24.817 --> 26:25.852
here in the mirror.

26:27.619 --> 26:28.820
I can enhance it,

26:28.855 --> 26:30.588
see what happens.

26:30.623 --> 26:33.625
Yes, get on with it.
What are you waiting for?

26:40.598 --> 26:41.867
(sighs)

26:42.902 --> 26:44.435
Everything okay?

26:44.470 --> 26:46.538
Yes, I'm fine.

26:49.575 --> 26:50.942
Fine.

26:50.977 --> 26:53.045
You don't have
to tell me.
No.

26:53.078 --> 26:55.047
(sighs)

26:55.080 --> 26:57.415
No, I do.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.652
I owe you that
much. After all,

26:59.685 --> 27:02.888
you're putting your life on the
line, well, for what is more

27:02.922 --> 27:05.657
than the retrieval
of a very dangerous weapon.

27:06.692 --> 27:08.394
The MI6 agent

27:08.426 --> 27:10.863
that disappeared
trying to retrieve Viro-486

27:10.896 --> 27:13.565
was my protégé.

27:15.801 --> 27:18.403
I taught her
everything she knew.

27:19.204 --> 27:21.673
What happened to her
wasn't your fault.

27:21.708 --> 27:25.678
But what is my fault
is altering her life's path.

27:25.711 --> 27:28.079
Placing her at MI6.

27:28.114 --> 27:29.682
If I hadn't...

27:29.715 --> 27:31.416
She'd be alive?

27:31.450 --> 27:33.451
Russ, you don't know that.

27:34.252 --> 27:37.757
But what I do know
is that you gave her purpose.

27:37.789 --> 27:39.759
The same way you did

27:39.791 --> 27:40.960
when you gave us all a job.

27:40.992 --> 27:43.028
When you brought
us all back together.

27:43.061 --> 27:46.397
How many lives did you save
just doing that?

27:48.867 --> 27:51.136
(computer beeps)
Guys, we got a hit.

27:55.741 --> 27:57.910
His name is Henri Bellouse.

27:57.943 --> 27:59.778
He's a world-class forger.

27:59.811 --> 28:01.413
DESI:
So, a forger visits

28:01.446 --> 28:03.148
a corrupt diplomat for
a late-night meeting?

28:03.182 --> 28:04.916
The very night
the bioweapon disappears.

28:04.951 --> 28:06.518
MacGYVER:
Why would Hannibal

28:06.551 --> 28:07.653
use Bellouse as a mule?

28:07.685 --> 28:10.122
He's a forger,
not a bio courier.

28:10.155 --> 28:11.857
MATTY:
Well, that's what we need

28:11.891 --> 28:13.992
to find out.
Got a position on him.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.661
Paris.

28:15.693 --> 28:17.663
Right. Turning
this plane around.

28:19.865 --> 28:21.700
(siren wailing)

28:28.507 --> 28:30.041
Damn it.

28:31.509 --> 28:33.179
Place is empty. Target's gone.

28:33.211 --> 28:34.512
What about the package?

28:35.513 --> 28:38.416
DESI:
Russ, check this out.

28:53.565 --> 28:54.933
There's enough evidence here

28:54.967 --> 28:57.568
of his forgery business
to put him away for life.

28:57.603 --> 29:00.205
The only issue is...

29:00.239 --> 29:03.142
the package has moved.

29:03.942 --> 29:06.278
MATTY:
Guys, he just entered
the building.

29:11.517 --> 29:13.484
(guns cock)

29:13.519 --> 29:16.488
Bonjour, Monsieur Bellouse.

29:19.290 --> 29:22.060
Bellouse says he mixed
the Viro-486 into paints

29:22.094 --> 29:24.063
that he used to make
a fake Rembrandt for Teague.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.064
Why?

29:25.096 --> 29:26.265
Well, the sale
is rigged.

29:26.298 --> 29:27.834
Teague's made arrangements
for Black Sun

29:27.866 --> 29:29.836
to buy the painting
at auction for $50 million.

29:29.868 --> 29:31.804
What's the best way to hand
it over with all the attention?

29:31.837 --> 29:33.538
If the virus is in the painting,

29:33.572 --> 29:34.772
it'll kill everyone
at the auction.

29:34.807 --> 29:36.674
A-Actually, no.

29:36.708 --> 29:38.978
The paint traps the virus
in a solid state

29:39.010 --> 29:40.645
so it can't move
through the air.

29:40.679 --> 29:41.712
Then, once it's
in their possession,

29:41.747 --> 29:42.748
they wet down the canvas,

29:42.780 --> 29:43.950
they-they run it
through a filter

29:43.982 --> 29:45.517
and distill the bioweapon.

29:45.550 --> 29:46.818
Only it'll never happen.

29:46.853 --> 29:47.987
Well, how are you
gonna prevent that?

29:48.019 --> 29:50.721
We're gonna steal the painting,
replace it with a double.

29:50.756 --> 29:52.758
Once Black Sun
make the transaction,

29:52.790 --> 29:54.026
we'll track them
out of play.

29:54.059 --> 29:56.627
We get the virus
and shut down a terror cell?

29:56.662 --> 29:57.829
I like it.

29:57.864 --> 29:58.964
I like it, too.

29:58.998 --> 29:59.865
In theory.

29:59.898 --> 30:00.967
And we've got the best thief

30:01.000 --> 30:02.701
in the business
to talk us through it.

30:02.733 --> 30:04.036
What else do we need?

30:04.069 --> 30:05.837
Where's the auction?

30:05.872 --> 30:08.840
Central Moscow Auction House,
in six hours.

30:08.875 --> 30:10.541
So we need to steal
the painting, replace it

30:10.576 --> 30:11.844
before it goes
on the block.

30:11.877 --> 30:12.743
We can make a forgery here,

30:12.778 --> 30:13.744
but it wouldn't get there
till tomorrow.

30:13.778 --> 30:15.547
No, I got a contact in
Brussels. He can get you

30:15.580 --> 30:16.949
the statue of David
in a half hour.

30:16.982 --> 30:18.683
All right. Well, you call him.

30:18.717 --> 30:19.951
Now.
RILEY: The security
in this place

30:19.986 --> 30:21.186
is no joke.

30:21.220 --> 30:23.021
It's gonna take
some serious improvisation.

30:23.055 --> 30:24.556
Well, that's just
the way I like it.

30:24.589 --> 30:25.892
MATTY:
I like your confidence, Mac,

30:25.924 --> 30:27.259
but I'm not quite sure

30:27.292 --> 30:29.095
a Swiss Army knife is gonna
get us out of this one.

30:29.127 --> 30:31.163
Well, maybe not, but we do have
a three-hour plane flight.

30:31.196 --> 30:33.765
I am sure we can
figure something out.

30:33.798 --> 30:36.167
Sure. No pressure or anything.

30:36.201 --> 30:37.903
If not, thousands,

30:37.936 --> 30:39.971
maybe millions,
of people will die.

30:40.006 --> 30:41.039
Only if we fail.

30:41.073 --> 30:42.240
Failure's not an option.

30:42.273 --> 30:43.808
Copy that.

30:50.249 --> 30:52.951
*

30:56.923 --> 30:58.924
(overlapping chatter)

31:23.882 --> 31:26.184
TAYLOR:
All right. Room's
clearing out.

31:26.218 --> 31:28.287
Desi, post up outside.

31:29.320 --> 31:30.689
DESI:
Copy that.

31:31.722 --> 31:34.259
Jess, you're up.

31:37.762 --> 31:40.031
Mac, make sure
the room stays clear.

31:54.113 --> 31:56.147
You sure this will work?

31:56.182 --> 31:57.682
My specs, your build?

31:58.584 --> 32:00.719
Could've made a good team
back in the day.

32:00.751 --> 32:04.690
Back in the day. That
means the past, right?

32:06.025 --> 32:08.094
Of course.

32:09.028 --> 32:10.261
Good.

32:26.345 --> 32:27.645
(tires screeching)

32:35.487 --> 32:37.788
MAN:
Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

32:37.823 --> 32:39.891
The auction is about to begin.

32:39.924 --> 32:41.326
(lock clicking)

32:45.197 --> 32:47.098
RILEY:
All right.

32:47.133 --> 32:50.301
We got control of their phones.

32:50.336 --> 32:52.337
Would you like
to do the honors?

32:54.306 --> 32:55.740
(beeps)

32:55.773 --> 32:58.076
(phone rings)

32:58.109 --> 33:00.945
Sergei...
(speaking Russian)

33:01.846 --> 33:03.082
Hello?

33:08.054 --> 33:11.957
MacGYVER:
In 1918, Harry Houdini made
an elephant disappear.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.359
Houdini used mirrors
to create the illusion,

33:14.393 --> 33:17.328
reflecting one half of the
empty stage over the elephant.

33:17.363 --> 33:20.031
Since a Rembrandt is much
smaller, a thin sheet of Mylar

33:20.066 --> 33:21.467
covering the painting
reflects the wall

33:21.500 --> 33:22.834
on the opposite side
of the room,

33:22.867 --> 33:25.770
hiding the painting
in plain sight.

33:25.804 --> 33:26.805
Oh, nyet.

33:28.507 --> 33:31.376
(disconnect tone)

33:34.512 --> 33:36.115
(phone ringing)

33:48.126 --> 33:50.796
(siren wailing)

34:04.942 --> 34:06.545
(chuckles)

34:27.099 --> 34:29.235
Rebooting security system now.

34:38.309 --> 34:40.077
RILEY:
Hurry up.

34:40.112 --> 34:43.382
You only have ten seconds before
the cameras come back online.

34:57.061 --> 34:59.063
(exhales sharply)

35:00.599 --> 35:02.867
Matty, we got it.

35:06.637 --> 35:09.074
AUCTIONEER:
Last call.

35:09.106 --> 35:11.076
$50 million.

35:11.108 --> 35:13.311
Sold.
(bangs gavel)

35:13.344 --> 35:14.980
BOZER:
Those guys are gonna be pissed

35:15.012 --> 35:16.414
when they find out
they paid $50 million

35:16.447 --> 35:18.550
for a forgery
with no bioweapon in it.

35:18.583 --> 35:20.286
MATTY:
Mac, follow them.

35:20.318 --> 35:21.552
We'll turn them,

35:21.586 --> 35:23.355
use their intel
to shut down the cell.

35:50.282 --> 35:52.016
Don't move.

35:55.920 --> 35:57.389
(silenced gunshot)
(groans)

35:58.356 --> 35:59.391
I told you.

36:02.027 --> 36:03.628
Do I know you?

36:07.565 --> 36:09.300
No.

36:09.335 --> 36:11.902
But you killed someone
very important to me,

36:11.936 --> 36:14.039
and I'm going to do
what she meant to do.

36:17.376 --> 36:19.478
(laughs softly)

36:19.510 --> 36:20.612
Kill me?

36:20.646 --> 36:24.382
Put you in a cell for a very,

36:24.416 --> 36:26.952
very long time.

36:26.985 --> 36:28.987
For her.

36:32.190 --> 36:34.192
(groaning)

36:39.130 --> 36:41.132
For me.

36:49.974 --> 36:53.077
Teague is on his way
to The Hague,

36:53.110 --> 36:56.681
the Black Sun operatives gave up
their entire organization,

36:56.715 --> 36:58.349
and the bioweapon
will be destroyed

36:58.384 --> 37:00.652
once we get it
to the lab.

37:00.686 --> 37:02.753
So, to success.

37:07.525 --> 37:08.693
Now you get
to go home, Jess.

37:08.726 --> 37:09.695
With a great story.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.429
Which you can
never tell anyone.

37:11.463 --> 37:13.465
Right.

37:17.068 --> 37:20.170
I need to ask you
something.

37:20.204 --> 37:22.172
Shoot.

37:22.206 --> 37:26.043
What did you mean back there,
at the auction house?

37:26.077 --> 37:29.681
I saw the bank blueprints

37:29.715 --> 37:33.652
under your students'
homework in your house.

37:33.684 --> 37:37.054
I know you're not retired.

37:37.088 --> 37:39.324
Are you gonna arrest me?

37:39.358 --> 37:42.360
And miss out on all the fun
catching you?

37:42.393 --> 37:43.528
No way.

37:46.532 --> 37:49.467
Oh, no, I'm not really
in the mood to celebrate.

37:49.501 --> 37:51.737
Thank you.

37:51.769 --> 37:53.739
Well, this isn't
for what we did.

37:53.771 --> 37:56.106
It's to celebrate her life.

37:59.677 --> 38:03.081
To Rebecca Meyers, a true hero.

38:07.485 --> 38:09.487
Rebecca.

38:22.266 --> 38:24.268
(bleating)

38:29.775 --> 38:33.478
Yes, well,
in our line of work, it's...

38:33.512 --> 38:35.514
it's hard to keep secrets.

38:37.114 --> 38:39.550
Especially from family.

38:42.253 --> 38:43.489
Mr. and Mrs. Meyers,
your daughter

38:43.521 --> 38:45.757
did not work in import/export.

38:45.791 --> 38:48.059
Rebecca worked for the
British government.

38:48.092 --> 38:49.427
MI6.

38:49.460 --> 38:53.632
She was a truly
outstanding agent.

38:53.664 --> 38:57.536
When I first
recruited her, she...

38:57.568 --> 39:00.639
she was hesitant because of the
lies she would have to tell.

39:01.706 --> 39:03.375
To you.

39:05.744 --> 39:09.547
Last week,
your daughter gave her life

39:09.581 --> 39:11.717
to save millions
of people.

39:21.393 --> 39:25.797
When we first sat down,
you said, "Sorry for your loss."

39:26.831 --> 39:28.298
I'm sorry

39:28.333 --> 39:30.601
for yours, too.
