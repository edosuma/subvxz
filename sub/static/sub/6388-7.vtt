00:02.490 --> 00:04.731
He gave me a ride because
I spent the night at his place.

00:04.986 --> 00:06.920
- What's his name?
- Ross.

00:06.988 --> 00:08.855
- What's your poison?
- Heroin...

00:08.889 --> 00:10.457
coke, booze, speed.

00:10.491 --> 00:11.725
A little bit
of everything, really.

00:11.759 --> 00:12.959
And there's all
the fucked up

00:12.994 --> 00:15.395
sexual shit
that goes along with it.

00:15.429 --> 00:17.030
How do you know
about Becca's thing tonight?

00:17.064 --> 00:19.366
Oh, we keep in touch.
She's always asking me

00:19.400 --> 00:20.800
questions about writing.
She never asks me

00:20.835 --> 00:22.636
questions about writing.

00:22.670 --> 00:24.571
Okay, hi.

00:24.605 --> 00:25.972
I'm--I'm--I'm here
to see Natalie.

00:26.007 --> 00:27.741
Natalie's my wife.

00:27.775 --> 00:28.975
Natalie said,

00:29.010 --> 00:30.877
"Let the new designer in."

00:30.911 --> 00:32.212
Okay, that's--that's me.

00:32.246 --> 00:33.780
I don't want
to twist your arm,

00:33.814 --> 00:36.149
but, um, I'd like
to take your hand here...

00:36.183 --> 00:39.019
And shove it up my skirt.
Mmm.

00:39.053 --> 00:41.054
If you're gonna die,

00:41.088 --> 00:42.889
wouldn't you rather die
with your dick in my bum?

00:42.923 --> 00:45.158
If I'm gonna die,
I'm gonna die doing

00:45.192 --> 00:47.227
what I was born to do.
This is it.

00:47.261 --> 00:49.062
This is the moment
we've been waiting for.

00:49.096 --> 00:51.264
I'm shitting genius right now.

00:51.299 --> 00:52.465
Hank, we gotta go!

00:52.500 --> 00:54.167
Do you guys mind
if I crash here?

00:54.201 --> 00:56.970
Do some writing?
Maybe have a few people over?

00:57.004 --> 00:59.105
- Whatever you need.
- Congratulations.

00:59.140 --> 01:02.642
You have made it

Hank?

01:26.901 --> 01:31.171
Jesus guide me!

01:42.883 --> 01:44.084
All the furniture
is in the bedroom, Hank.

01:44.118 --> 01:46.453
Shh, shh, shh!

01:46.487 --> 01:48.321
- Just the tip. Come on.
- No!

01:48.356 --> 01:50.023
Get a condom.
Is that Becca?

01:50.091 --> 01:52.325
Just like five seconds.
Four seconds.

01:52.360 --> 01:55.562
She looks good, Hank.

01:55.596 --> 01:57.731
She's grown up.
I'll kill you.

01:57.765 --> 02:00.500
- She's very well-developed.
- I will fucking kill you.

02:00.534 --> 02:06.039
You know chlorine kills
99.9% of the sperm, right?

02:06.107 --> 02:07.340
It's true.

02:07.375 --> 02:09.342
Okay, fine.

02:09.377 --> 02:11.511
I'll get a condom, jeez.

02:11.545 --> 02:13.847
Hey, Hank! What's up?
Hey...

02:13.881 --> 02:15.215
- Oh!
- Dad!

02:17.718 --> 02:19.319
- Hi, Becca.
- Ohh!

You didn't have to hit him.

03:05.433 --> 03:08.168
No, I didn't have to.
I wanted to.

03:08.202 --> 03:09.769
He could sue you.

03:09.804 --> 03:11.171
Yeah, but then I'd have
to cut off his dick

03:11.205 --> 03:12.906
and feed it to the homeless.
You know what?

03:12.973 --> 03:15.074
I still haven't heard
you say you're sorry.

03:15.109 --> 03:17.076
Am I sorry for messing up
Charlie's place?

03:17.111 --> 03:18.878
Yes, of course,
and I will clean it up.

03:18.913 --> 03:20.246
But am I sorry for throwing

03:20.281 --> 03:22.515
a killer party and having
an awesome time?

03:22.583 --> 03:24.617
Absolutely not.

03:24.652 --> 03:25.885
This is becoming
a problem, Becca.

03:25.920 --> 03:27.120
- Right.
- I'm not sure I agree.

03:27.154 --> 03:28.388
Give me that.

03:29.657 --> 03:31.124
Booyah!

03:31.158 --> 03:32.325
Great, now you have
to buy me a new one.

03:32.359 --> 03:33.960
- No, I don't.
- Fine.

03:33.994 --> 03:35.728
Then you won't be able
to get in touch with me.

03:35.796 --> 03:37.564
I could be holed up
in a crack den somewhere,

03:37.598 --> 03:39.466
and you wouldn't be able
to track my iPhone.

03:39.500 --> 03:40.733
I don't like you
very much right now.

03:40.768 --> 03:42.068
Do you like
her very much right now?

03:42.102 --> 03:43.336
- No, I don't.
- Hmm.

03:43.370 --> 03:44.804
I don't see what
the big deal is.

03:44.839 --> 03:47.006
You drank all the time.
Not all the time.

03:47.041 --> 03:49.108
- You smoke pot.
- When it's around.

03:49.143 --> 03:50.577
It's not like I have
one of those

03:50.611 --> 03:52.479
magic marijuana cards
or anything, right?

03:52.513 --> 03:53.713
Do you use cocaine?

03:55.483 --> 03:58.551
I have experimented with
the drug you call cocaine.

03:58.619 --> 04:00.119
A long, long time ago,

04:00.154 --> 04:02.121
in a galaxy far, far away,

04:02.156 --> 04:03.823
in my misspent youth.
That's a lie.

04:03.858 --> 04:05.859
Well, sometimes it's important
to lie to children.

04:05.893 --> 04:07.360
Mmhmm.

04:07.394 --> 04:09.062
- This is not a very good talk.
- No, it's not.

04:09.096 --> 04:10.430
Bottom line is,

04:10.464 --> 04:11.664
you're making some questionable

04:11.699 --> 04:13.032
choices right now.
Huh. Yeah.

04:13.067 --> 04:15.001
Says the queen
of questionable choices.

04:15.035 --> 04:16.736
- Hey! Be respectful
- Ow.

04:16.769 --> 04:18.605
Of your mother's
questionable choices.

04:18.639 --> 04:20.640
Look, I respect you both.
Always.

04:20.673 --> 04:23.977
My home life has been chaotic,
to say the least.

04:24.011 --> 04:26.446
But I've always kept it
together.

04:26.480 --> 04:27.981
You guys had it easy with me.

04:28.048 --> 04:29.983
Agreed.

04:30.017 --> 04:31.618
But you can't expect
us to ignore

04:31.652 --> 04:33.319
the fact that you're

04:33.354 --> 04:35.394
out of control right now.
Yeah, yeah, what she said.

04:35.422 --> 04:37.624
But I'm having so much fun.

04:37.658 --> 04:40.293
I'm partying like a rock star.

04:40.327 --> 04:41.928
Okay, look, enough
of this jibber-jabber.

04:41.962 --> 04:43.363
No more lectures.

04:43.397 --> 04:44.664
Let's take this shit

04:44.698 --> 04:45.899

Come on.

04:45.933 --> 04:47.400
Let's go.

04:50.437 --> 04:57.877
♪

05:00.281 --> 05:01.481

05:01.515 --> 05:02.715
What is--what?

05:02.750 --> 05:04.417
Yee!

05:04.451 --> 05:06.252
- Okay, what the fuck is that?
- What--I'm sorry.

05:06.287 --> 05:07.654
I'm sorry. Look, I just--

05:07.688 --> 05:09.422
I had an experience recently--

05:09.456 --> 05:11.090
Yeah, like a gay thing?
I heard.

05:11.125 --> 05:13.026
No, no, I'm totally
straight now.

05:13.060 --> 05:14.360
Didn't you hear?

05:14.395 --> 05:15.595
No.

05:15.629 --> 05:17.530
I heard that
you got fired again.

05:17.565 --> 05:19.432
Well, yes,
that was unfortunate.

05:19.466 --> 05:22.602
But...

05:22.636 --> 05:24.103
Are you trying to get out

05:24.138 --> 05:26.205
of your child support payments
or something?

05:26.240 --> 05:27.607
- Look, a bow.
- Is that--stop it.

05:27.641 --> 05:30.243
- No! No, never.
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

05:30.277 --> 05:31.911
- God, I got a new job.
- Mm-hmm.

05:31.946 --> 05:34.514
A good job.
I do still

05:34.548 --> 05:36.516
wonder why I have to pay you

05:36.550 --> 05:39.919
to care for a child that you
named after your second husband.

05:39.954 --> 05:42.121
That still does
not sit well with me.

05:42.156 --> 05:43.523
He's your son, Charlie!

05:43.557 --> 05:44.924
I know, I know,
and I love him to death.

05:44.959 --> 05:46.759
And that's what
I'm here about, really.

05:46.794 --> 05:50.129
Because I had a life-or-death
experience recently.

05:50.164 --> 05:52.131
And it really--
it clarified things

05:52.166 --> 05:54.167
for me, Marcy.
It focused things.

05:54.201 --> 05:57.971
And I thought,
I would really like

05:58.005 --> 05:59.672
to spend the day with
you and little Stu.

05:59.740 --> 06:01.608
Well, that's great.

06:01.642 --> 06:03.776
You're welcome
to spend the day with Stu,

06:03.811 --> 06:05.545
and I will go shopping.

06:05.579 --> 06:06.946
That works too.

06:06.981 --> 06:09.716
Happy to lighten your load.

06:09.750 --> 06:11.751
What?
I don't know.

06:11.785 --> 06:14.253
I just know you're working
some kind of angle here.

06:14.288 --> 06:16.322
No, Marcy, scout's honor.
I have no angle.

06:16.357 --> 06:18.524
I am angle-free.

06:18.559 --> 06:21.227
That's bullshit, because we
all know you're dick's all bent.

06:21.261 --> 06:22.662
Thanks for reminding me.

06:22.696 --> 06:24.597
That's what I'm here for.

06:24.632 --> 06:26.566
Just keepin' it real, Runkle.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.835
I'm just glad
you're thinking about it.

06:28.869 --> 06:30.336
All right!

06:30.371 --> 06:32.705
Stuart!

06:32.740 --> 06:34.574
I know all this
"partying like a rock star"

06:34.608 --> 06:36.142
stuff looks like fun,

06:36.176 --> 06:37.777
but this shit eventually
turns on you, you know?

06:37.811 --> 06:39.379
You wanna know what
a real rock star looks like?

06:39.413 --> 06:41.280
It ain't pretty.

06:44.818 --> 06:46.352
Hank.

06:46.387 --> 06:49.288
Friend.

06:49.323 --> 06:51.791
I missed you.

06:51.825 --> 06:53.126
And you brought
your family with you.

06:53.193 --> 06:55.028
- Yes.
- Is--is that your child?

06:55.062 --> 06:56.796
Becca.

06:56.830 --> 06:57.997
Hello, child.

06:58.032 --> 06:59.499
Hi.

06:59.533 --> 07:01.267
She speaks English.

07:01.301 --> 07:04.137
And Karen, oh, my God!

07:04.171 --> 07:06.039
- Hey.
- I had a dream about you.

07:06.073 --> 07:07.306
- Oh.
- Did I tell you?

07:07.341 --> 07:08.975
I was standing on the stage,

07:09.009 --> 07:10.610
and I spied you
in the front row.

07:10.644 --> 07:13.479
And I was enchanted
by your preternatural beauty.

07:13.514 --> 07:15.114
So I focused all my

07:15.149 --> 07:17.517
energy on you, and--and--

07:17.551 --> 07:20.453
and I made you have an orgasm
just by looking at you.

07:20.487 --> 07:21.788
Hmm, how do you know
she wasn't faking it?

07:21.822 --> 07:25.324
It was my fucking dream.

07:28.729 --> 07:30.897
Oh, ooh, oh, God.

07:30.931 --> 07:33.499
Ooh, I'm feeling something.

07:33.534 --> 07:35.535
- I think it's bouncing off--
- Shut the fuck up.

07:35.569 --> 07:37.904
Come on, I've got someone
to introduce you to.

07:37.938 --> 07:39.706
He's a big fan of yours.
And mine.

07:39.740 --> 07:41.908
You see what I mean?

07:41.942 --> 07:46.813
Hank, Karen, child...

07:46.847 --> 07:49.649
I would like you to meet
the poet and philosopher,

07:49.683 --> 07:51.751
- Holy shit, that's...
- Marilyn Manson.

07:53.887 --> 07:56.589
We're talking about doing
a duet together.

07:56.623 --> 07:57.990
Maybe a tour of the states.

07:58.025 --> 07:59.859
That would be really something,
eh?

07:59.893 --> 08:01.294
I'm just here
for the narcotics.

08:03.097 --> 08:05.031
He'she--he kids.

08:05.065 --> 08:06.365
Not really.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.034
- He does--
- Hey, listen,

08:08.068 --> 08:09.736
I brought Becca here
because I want--

08:09.770 --> 08:11.838
- Becca? Who's Becca?
- My daughter.

08:11.872 --> 08:13.339
Oh, the child.

08:13.373 --> 08:15.007
Yeah.
She's recently discovered

08:15.075 --> 08:16.442
the joys of substance abuse...

08:16.477 --> 08:18.144
And I want to disabuse
her of the notion

08:18.178 --> 08:20.546
that it won't hurt her
in the long run, you understand?

08:20.581 --> 08:22.548
Why would you do that?

08:22.583 --> 08:24.717
Because I love her,
and I don't want her to O.D.

08:24.752 --> 08:26.285
before she's
of legal drinking age.

08:26.320 --> 08:28.054
Can you help a brother out?

08:28.088 --> 08:29.722
Absolutely.

08:29.757 --> 08:32.792
I've done quite a few anti-drug
P.S.A.s in my time.

08:32.826 --> 08:36.028
- Mm-hmm.
- Some of them sober even.

08:36.063 --> 08:37.263
Hank Moody?

08:37.297 --> 08:39.030
Marilyn Manson.

08:39.099 --> 08:40.633
I'm a fan of your words.

08:40.667 --> 08:42.568
- Oh.
- I'd be honored

08:42.602 --> 08:48.074
if you came
and did some narcotics with me.

08:48.108 --> 08:50.209
This is so fucking cool.

08:50.244 --> 08:53.780
Yeah, it is fucking cool.

08:53.814 --> 08:55.815
I know, I see you

08:55.849 --> 08:58.050
inside the mouth,
that's right, I know.

08:58.118 --> 08:59.318
Ow! What the--

09:00.687 --> 09:02.955
Braden!
I'm so sorry.

09:02.990 --> 09:05.324
You're new here.
Yeah, I am.

09:05.359 --> 09:07.660
Yeah, it kind of makes you
want to eat a shotgun, huh?

09:07.694 --> 09:10.129
You said it, sister.

09:10.164 --> 09:12.632
I'm Tricia.
Hi. Charlie.

09:12.666 --> 09:14.767
Nice to meet you.

09:14.802 --> 09:18.204
I'm, uh, Braden, Aidan,
and Jaden's mom.

09:18.238 --> 09:19.605
- Wow.
- Yeah.

09:19.640 --> 09:21.607
You're making me feel lazy.

09:21.642 --> 09:22.842
I just have the one.

09:22.876 --> 09:24.143
Don't do that, Stuie.

09:24.178 --> 09:25.344
Nope, not in your mouth!

09:25.379 --> 09:26.646
Okay.

09:26.680 --> 09:28.514
Are you married?
Eh, divorced.

09:28.549 --> 09:29.782
- Yeah.
- You?

09:29.817 --> 09:32.018
Married.
23 years.

09:32.052 --> 09:34.654
- Really? Wow!
- Yeah.

09:34.688 --> 09:37.023
You don't even look old enough
to be married that long.

09:37.057 --> 09:38.791
Oh, thank you.
That's sweet.

09:38.826 --> 09:41.194
Actually, my husband and I
are high school sweethearts.

09:41.228 --> 09:43.162
- That is so cool.
- Well.

09:43.197 --> 09:45.531
- And inspiring, you know?
- Don't do that. No.

09:45.566 --> 09:46.999
Toto make it work for...

09:47.034 --> 09:48.267
- Yeah.
- So long.

09:48.302 --> 09:49.936
It's work.
It is, actually.

09:49.970 --> 09:52.638
Hard work.
I see you, Stu.

09:52.673 --> 09:53.973
I don't know.

09:54.007 --> 09:56.309
You gotta
be just best friends and,

09:56.343 --> 09:57.743
I don't know,
keep it fresh somehow.

09:57.744 --> 09:59.178
- Absolutely.
- Yes.

09:59.213 --> 10:01.214
You gotta tell me
your secret sometime.

10:01.248 --> 10:03.983
Hey, would you want to get the
kids together for a playdate?

10:04.017 --> 10:05.518
- Uh, yeah, sure, I guess.
- Yeah.

10:05.552 --> 10:07.119
You put your phone number
in here,

10:07.154 --> 10:08.354
and I'll text you sometime.

10:08.388 --> 10:09.689
Okay.

10:09.723 --> 10:11.123
Here you go.
Perfect.

10:18.665 --> 10:21.067
I'm sorry.
Is this from you?

10:21.101 --> 10:22.802
Why are you apologizing?

10:22.836 --> 10:24.637
Just give me five minutes.

10:24.671 --> 10:26.672
Well, wh-what about the kids?

10:26.707 --> 10:29.008
Don't be such a fucking pussy.
They're fine.

10:32.913 --> 10:35.414
Uh, Stuie, daddy has to go--

10:35.449 --> 10:38.818
I'm--just stay inside
the dragon, okay, Stuie?

10:38.852 --> 10:41.520
In the mouth.

10:45.459 --> 10:48.027
I love doing drugs.

10:48.061 --> 10:50.863
Hey, that sounds like
something you would say, Dad.

10:50.898 --> 10:52.732
Yeah, as--as a joke, maybe.

10:52.766 --> 10:54.767
Here's the thing, child.

10:54.835 --> 10:57.536
Some of us are Keith Moon,

10:57.571 --> 10:59.071
and some of us
are Keith Richards.

10:59.106 --> 11:01.040
And--and you don't know
which one you are

11:01.074 --> 11:04.777
until you end up in a coffin
or in an old people's home.

11:04.811 --> 11:06.879
Huh, that's comforting.
Thank you.

11:06.914 --> 11:08.581
Here's something
they don't tell you.

11:08.615 --> 11:10.116
Rampant sexual behavior,

11:10.150 --> 11:12.385
drug use, etcetera...

11:12.419 --> 11:15.087
You will end up with AIDS.

11:15.122 --> 11:17.223
Well, no,
they do tell you that, actually.

11:17.257 --> 11:18.925
Well, I wish they
would have told me,

11:18.959 --> 11:22.528
because I have AIDS, now.

11:25.499 --> 11:27.600
I'm just fucking kidding.

11:27.634 --> 11:31.137
Why are you guys so serious?

11:31.171 --> 11:34.507
Christmas. I want AIDS.

11:34.541 --> 11:37.209
Should we just say
this whole thing backfired,

11:37.244 --> 11:38.477
and get the fuck out of here.

11:38.512 --> 11:39.946
Now.

11:39.980 --> 11:42.982
Listen, Moody,
love your words, much respect.

11:43.016 --> 11:44.383
But I like your taste
in women better.

11:44.418 --> 11:45.885
She's a handsome one,
isn't she?

11:45.919 --> 11:48.087
I had a dream about
her last night.

11:48.121 --> 11:52.792
I made her come
just by looking at her.

11:52.826 --> 11:54.126
You guys aren't together
anymore, right?

11:54.161 --> 11:55.828
So is it cool if I--

11:55.862 --> 11:57.096
Do not start with me,
Marilyn Manson,

11:57.130 --> 11:58.831
or we will tussle.

11:58.865 --> 12:00.599
You want to tussle with me?

12:00.634 --> 12:02.468
Seriously, you wanna tussle?
Tussle!

12:02.502 --> 12:03.903
- I'll tussle with you.
- Come on, Dad, don't fight...

12:03.937 --> 12:05.304
- I'll tussle.
- With Marilyn Manson.

12:05.339 --> 12:06.806
He's one of my heroes.

12:06.840 --> 12:08.975
Hear that, dad?
Fucking hero.

12:09.009 --> 12:10.509
Okay, okay, well--you--

12:10.544 --> 12:12.578
please, let's just steer
this shit back around,

12:12.612 --> 12:14.213
all right?

12:14.247 --> 12:16.449
Now, I put it to the esteemed
panel: Is it possible

12:16.516 --> 12:18.084
to make great art without
killing yourself?

12:18.118 --> 12:19.518
I say, "yes."

12:19.553 --> 12:21.754
Me too!

12:21.788 --> 12:23.189
Totally possible.

12:23.223 --> 12:26.692
But drugs
just make it more fun.

12:26.727 --> 12:28.127
I like this chick.

12:28.161 --> 12:29.662
Boom.

12:29.696 --> 12:31.330
Yeah, I need to urinate
and possibly vomit.

12:31.365 --> 12:32.665
- Come on.
- Here, look...

12:32.699 --> 12:34.433
- Okay, so this...
- Becca, come on.

12:34.468 --> 12:36.268
Look, please, just--just--
just stay here and make sure

12:36.303 --> 12:37.703
she doesn't ingest anything.

12:37.738 --> 12:39.138
Let's get the fuck
out of here, now.

12:39.172 --> 12:40.806
- Listen, listen.
- What are you doing?

12:40.841 --> 12:42.274
These guys are a fucking mess.
She's gonna get it.

12:42.309 --> 12:44.143
Eventually.
Just let her--she will.

12:44.177 --> 12:46.812
- She's loving it!
- Mom, take a picture.

12:46.847 --> 12:49.548
Are you kidding me?

12:54.388 --> 12:56.889
- That you, Charlie?
- Yep.

12:56.923 --> 12:59.525
- What took you so long?
- Well--I--you know--

12:59.559 --> 13:01.494
I was in the ladies',
sorry.

13:01.561 --> 13:03.095
I guess I misunderstood.

13:03.163 --> 13:05.998
Well, get on in here.

13:06.033 --> 13:08.167
Whoaho! Tricia!

13:08.201 --> 13:09.902
Looking good.

13:09.936 --> 13:12.738
All right, well.

13:12.773 --> 13:14.507
Uh, well I gotta tell you,

13:14.541 --> 13:15.941
this is already way better

13:15.976 --> 13:17.643
than my last naughty
bathroom experience.

13:17.677 --> 13:18.878
Don't call me Tricia.
I'm not Tricia right now.

13:18.912 --> 13:20.179
I'm Hannah.

13:20.213 --> 13:22.248
Okay.
Is that like a...

13:22.282 --> 13:23.682
Multiple personality
thing, or...

13:23.717 --> 13:26.018
No, silly,
it's my website.

13:26.053 --> 13:28.387
Yeah, Housewife Hannah?
You do know it?

13:28.422 --> 13:29.922
- Mm, I don't think so.
- Funny.

13:29.956 --> 13:31.157
I took you for a big porn guy.

13:31.191 --> 13:32.591
- Oh, I am.
- Oh.

13:32.626 --> 13:34.794
- I--and, oh, is it a pay site?
- It sure is.

13:34.828 --> 13:36.362
Yeah, that's what it is.
'Cause I don't really like

13:36.396 --> 13:37.663
to pay for my porn.
It's--it's a thing.

13:37.697 --> 13:39.198
Okay, shh.

13:39.232 --> 13:40.666
Stop talking.

13:40.700 --> 13:43.135
I'm gonna need you
to film this for me.

13:43.203 --> 13:45.037
Film...What, exactly?

13:45.072 --> 13:47.239
I'm gonna suck your dick,
and you're gonna film it.

13:47.274 --> 13:49.575
Then you're gonna give
me a big messy facial.

13:49.609 --> 13:51.177
That's my thing.

13:51.211 --> 13:53.079
That's what I'm known for,
you know?

13:53.113 --> 13:54.580
In fact, the messier the better.

13:54.614 --> 13:57.283
Just get it all over
my glasses and shit.

13:57.317 --> 13:58.684
That's what the fans love.

13:58.718 --> 14:00.853
Okay, this is
a good shot right there.

14:00.887 --> 14:02.688
Oh, oh, oh...You're gonna want
to put this on.

14:02.722 --> 14:04.757
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:04.791 --> 14:06.025
I mean, you probably don't want
to show your face, right?

14:06.059 --> 14:07.259
Oh, probably not.

14:07.294 --> 14:09.028
Good idea.
Yeah, yeah.

14:09.062 --> 14:11.030
- But, has anyone else worn--
- Put the fucking mask on.

14:11.064 --> 14:12.965
- It doesn't matter, okay, yeah.
- Just put the fucking mask on.

14:12.999 --> 14:15.734
Chop, chop.

14:15.769 --> 14:16.936
Okay, good.

14:16.970 --> 14:18.637
- Okay?
- Yeah.

14:18.672 --> 14:21.207
- Does it look good?
- Eh, it's fine. All right.

14:21.241 --> 14:22.842
Okay, you ready?
Yeah.

14:22.876 --> 14:24.110
All right, let's do this.

14:24.144 --> 14:25.444
Get that cock out.

14:25.479 --> 14:28.047
Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.

14:28.081 --> 14:30.449
Yeah, and remember...
On my face, okay?

14:30.484 --> 14:32.551
- Okay.
- You listening?

14:32.586 --> 14:34.587
- Yeah.
- Okay. Are you listening?

14:34.621 --> 14:37.490
Yeah, uh-huh.
Okay--oh, oh.

14:37.524 --> 14:39.558
Oh, unh.

14:39.593 --> 14:41.727
Oh...Oh...Yeah!

14:41.761 --> 14:44.096
Ah, oh!

14:44.131 --> 14:45.798
Oh, ah.

14:45.832 --> 14:47.600
Oh ho-ho-ho.
Oh!

14:47.634 --> 14:48.834
Ahh!

14:48.869 --> 14:50.202
Dude!

14:50.270 --> 14:53.305
What the fuck?

14:53.340 --> 14:55.341
My God, you just wasted
your load.

14:55.375 --> 14:57.109
You're supposed to
shoot it on my face.

14:57.144 --> 14:59.845
Well you--the whole situation.
It's very exciting.

14:59.880 --> 15:01.113
Do you wanna go again?
'Cause I could do better.

15:01.148 --> 15:02.515
No, no, forget it.

15:02.549 --> 15:04.483
Just get the fuck out of here,
you loser.

15:04.518 --> 15:07.219
Give me my mask.

15:07.287 --> 15:09.155
Like, now.

15:09.189 --> 15:12.324
God. Go!

15:12.359 --> 15:14.927
You want to know the secret
to a good marriage?

15:14.961 --> 15:16.629
Listen to her
every once in a while.

15:16.663 --> 15:18.697
Is that so fucking hard?

15:18.732 --> 15:19.932
Do you still wanna
do the playdate?

15:19.966 --> 15:21.400
No.

15:29.743 --> 15:32.378
Hey, stud.

15:32.412 --> 15:33.946
Oh, dear.

15:33.980 --> 15:36.515
Mm.

15:36.550 --> 15:38.484
I knew you wouldn't
stay away for long.

15:38.518 --> 15:39.718
Actually, I'm here
with my daughter.

15:39.753 --> 15:41.120
I brought her here to teach her

15:41.154 --> 15:43.656
about the perils of drug
and alcohol abuse.

15:43.690 --> 15:44.924
Oh, how's that working
out for you?

15:44.958 --> 15:47.426
- Not well. Not well at all.
- Mm.

15:47.460 --> 15:48.961
Have you had the tour?

15:48.995 --> 15:50.162
Oh, I don't believe I have.

15:50.197 --> 15:52.164
- So many rooms.
- Mm.

15:52.199 --> 15:55.234
So many nooks and crannies.

15:55.268 --> 15:58.170
So many places to curl
up and get lost.

15:58.205 --> 16:00.239
Oh, well, I don't think
I'd wanna get lost.

16:00.273 --> 16:01.640
You know?
In fact,

16:01.675 --> 16:03.542
I should probably get back
to the war room

16:03.577 --> 16:05.077
before somebody gets pregnant.

16:05.111 --> 16:06.378
- Hey.
- Yes.

16:06.413 --> 16:07.646
Did you know Atticus collects

16:07.681 --> 16:09.615
medieval torture devices?

16:09.649 --> 16:11.750
No, I did not,
but that revelation does not

16:11.785 --> 16:13.252
particularly surprise me.

16:13.286 --> 16:14.987
Do you know what
a breast ripper is, Hank?

16:15.021 --> 16:16.555
No, I do not,

16:16.590 --> 16:18.657
but it's pretty
self-explanatory,

16:18.692 --> 16:20.226
and nasty.

16:20.260 --> 16:22.962
It tore to shreds the breasts
of women

16:22.996 --> 16:25.731
that were convicted
of adultery.

16:25.765 --> 16:27.700
Why, why? Why ruin
a perfectly good breast?

16:27.767 --> 16:28.934
That doesn't make any sense.

16:28.969 --> 16:30.402
Oh, you're sweet.

16:30.437 --> 16:31.870
Thank you.

16:31.905 --> 16:34.039
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't mean yours.

16:34.074 --> 16:36.075
Oh, you don't
think they're lovely?

16:36.109 --> 16:37.509
Oh, no, they're killer.

16:37.544 --> 16:39.011
You've got beautiful cans.

16:39.045 --> 16:40.446
It's just that,
it's inappropriate

16:40.480 --> 16:41.714
to talk about another
man's breasts.

16:41.748 --> 16:43.215
You--you know what I mean?

16:43.250 --> 16:44.883
I'll decide
what's inappropriate.

16:44.918 --> 16:47.119
I am not sure that you should.

16:47.153 --> 16:48.454
Touch 'em.

16:48.488 --> 16:49.989
Oh, no, I'm--I'm good.

16:50.023 --> 16:52.091
Come on, you don't want
to touch them?

16:52.125 --> 16:54.260
All right, maybe just--
just one, just...

16:55.829 --> 16:58.931
Oh, God, oh.

16:58.999 --> 17:01.033
It's just been so long
since I was groped

17:01.067 --> 17:03.669
by capable hands. Oh!

17:03.703 --> 17:05.537
Karen!

17:05.605 --> 17:08.140
Um, just a breast exam.

17:08.208 --> 17:09.474
You know, checking for lumps?

17:11.144 --> 17:13.145
I think you're okay.
You should be fine.

17:13.179 --> 17:15.047
I'll do the same for you.
Anytime, anywhere.

17:15.080 --> 17:16.415
You know I will.

17:16.449 --> 17:18.884
Yeah.
So, Marilyn Manson's trying

17:18.917 --> 17:21.619
to get your daughter and
I into a threesome right now.

17:21.655 --> 17:24.022
Oh, that's my cue.

17:34.934 --> 17:36.669
Okay, Becca, I get it.
I give up.

17:36.703 --> 17:38.237
All right,
this is way too much fun.

17:38.271 --> 17:41.173
If I was your age and this
was happening to me,

17:41.207 --> 17:44.076
I would tell my parents
to fuck off and die too.

17:44.110 --> 17:45.444
My father would punch me
in the mouth,

17:45.478 --> 17:46.678
but that's another story,
so...

17:46.680 --> 17:47.946
We're gonna leave.

17:47.981 --> 17:49.181
We're gonna...
What? What?

17:49.249 --> 17:50.582
Leave you to have fun
with your hero.

17:50.617 --> 17:53.185
What the fuck are you
talking about?

17:53.219 --> 17:55.154
Mom, dad, easy, come on.
I'm gonna take care of the girl.

17:55.188 --> 17:56.822
Look at this face.
Come on.

17:56.856 --> 17:58.090
The girl's gonna be fine.

17:58.124 --> 17:59.958
We're gonna make some s'mores,

17:59.993 --> 18:01.427
and tell ghost stories,

18:01.461 --> 18:02.895
talk about our favorite
serial killers.

18:02.929 --> 18:05.364
I'll have her home by dawn,
I swear.

18:07.801 --> 18:09.335
Becca, take a picture
of me teabagging

18:09.369 --> 18:13.672
before he wakes up.

18:13.707 --> 18:15.974
No more, Manson.

18:16.009 --> 18:18.510
No more balls, Manson.

18:18.545 --> 18:20.546
Too many balls.

18:20.580 --> 18:21.980
Get off me.

18:22.015 --> 18:24.883
- Daddy?
- Yes, my boy?

18:24.918 --> 18:27.653
- Where did you go today?
- Hmm?

18:27.687 --> 18:29.221
What do you mean?

18:29.255 --> 18:32.324
You were in the bathroom
for a very long time.

18:32.359 --> 18:34.393
Oh. Oh, yeah.

18:34.427 --> 18:37.563
Those chicken fingers
gave daddy a bad tummy.

18:37.597 --> 18:39.365
I had to make big potty.

18:45.572 --> 18:46.839
Good night, mommy.

18:46.873 --> 18:49.208
Good night, daddy.
I love you.

18:49.242 --> 18:51.176
Oh, buddy.

18:51.211 --> 18:53.612
Good night, baby.

19:05.558 --> 19:07.259
He's so happy.

19:07.293 --> 19:09.762
'Cause this is the way
it's supposed to be.

19:09.796 --> 19:12.564
He should fall asleep
like this every night.

19:12.599 --> 19:16.702
Yeah, that's a nice little
fairy tale, Charlie.

19:16.736 --> 19:19.037
But it's not the reality
of his life.

19:19.072 --> 19:22.074
Maybe it should be.

19:22.108 --> 19:26.011
Why can't we make it so,
for him?

19:26.045 --> 19:32.418
Because, the people
who made him

19:32.452 --> 19:34.753
weren't meant to be together.

19:34.788 --> 19:37.356
Are you sure about that?

19:37.390 --> 19:39.191
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

19:39.225 --> 19:41.860
I think I have the divorce
papers to prove it.

19:41.895 --> 19:43.228
Okay, you know what?

19:43.263 --> 19:45.697
I've made certain mistakes,
Marcy.

19:45.732 --> 19:47.332
You've made certain mistakes.

19:47.367 --> 19:50.269
Maybe it's time we just
get past all that already,

19:50.303 --> 19:51.670
and start to get real.

19:51.704 --> 19:54.640
Yeah, like it's
just that easy.

19:54.674 --> 19:59.411
Well, maybe it is.

19:59.446 --> 20:03.015
I still love you, Marcy.

20:03.049 --> 20:04.716
What?

20:04.751 --> 20:06.485
Why are you telling me this?
I don't know.

20:06.519 --> 20:07.820
I don't know.
It just came out.

20:07.854 --> 20:10.055
Well keep that shit
to yourself.

20:10.089 --> 20:11.623
I can't.
Because when I feel something,

20:11.658 --> 20:15.060
I like to express it.
Good for you.

20:15.094 --> 20:16.328
But I'm done with you.

20:16.362 --> 20:17.629
I'm done with Stu.

20:17.664 --> 20:19.798
I'm done with men.

20:19.833 --> 20:23.569
Realso, what,
you're into women now?

20:23.603 --> 20:27.606
No, you jackass.

20:31.244 --> 20:32.811
Gross.

20:32.846 --> 20:34.046
Stop it.

20:34.080 --> 20:35.814
Shh.

20:35.849 --> 20:38.717
You're gonna wake the boy.

20:49.128 --> 20:50.562
Okay, this is stupid.
I--I can't stand it.

20:50.630 --> 20:52.297
I'm going in!
Wait-hold on a minute.

20:52.332 --> 20:53.832
It's gotta be her decision.
No-I'm going in.

20:53.867 --> 20:55.100
I know her.
She'll be out in a minute.

20:55.134 --> 20:57.135
What happens
if he has abducted her,

20:57.170 --> 20:59.505
and he is selling
her into sex trafficking?

20:59.539 --> 21:02.541
He's a rock star, Karen,
not a sex trafficker.

21:02.575 --> 21:04.443
He could be both.

21:04.477 --> 21:06.044
Quick, let's go!
He's looking for me.

21:06.079 --> 21:07.646
He wants me to film him
pooping on Atticus.

21:07.680 --> 21:08.914
That's my line.

21:08.948 --> 21:10.949
That's my girl.

21:14.320 --> 21:17.022
So, what have
we learned today, folks?

21:17.056 --> 21:20.225
I think we've learned
that some things never change.

21:20.260 --> 21:21.994
Well, that sounds
a bit pointed, lady.

21:22.061 --> 21:23.228
What do you mean by that?

21:23.263 --> 21:24.897
Everything I learned,
I already knew.

21:24.931 --> 21:27.699
I know you guys love me.
I know you care.

21:27.734 --> 21:31.837
I know drugs are good and bad,
and dangerous and fun.

21:31.871 --> 21:33.111
I know those guys are lunatics.

21:33.139 --> 21:35.007
I'm never going to be like that.

21:35.041 --> 21:38.043
I'm just trying to figure
it out for myself.

21:38.077 --> 21:39.578
And I know that's scary
for you guys,

21:39.612 --> 21:42.247
but you're just going
to have to trust me.

21:42.282 --> 21:43.849
Can you do that?

21:43.883 --> 21:45.083
I suppose so.

21:45.118 --> 21:47.052
Well, you don't exactly leave

21:47.086 --> 21:49.655
us with much choice.
Great.

21:49.689 --> 21:52.357
Well, I'm glad
we got that settled.

21:52.392 --> 21:53.825
I'm gonna hang in my room.

21:53.860 --> 21:55.360
Security check.

21:55.395 --> 21:58.530
Did you pack your
bag yourself, ma'am?

21:58.565 --> 21:59.731
Oh, I see.

21:59.766 --> 22:01.033
What?

22:01.067 --> 22:02.868
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh-huh.

22:02.902 --> 22:06.338
And...that you can keep.

22:06.372 --> 22:08.840
Really?

22:13.046 --> 22:15.280
- Good night.
- I will make sure this goes

22:15.315 --> 22:18.617
directly into police evidence.

22:18.651 --> 22:20.218
Nightcap?
No.

22:20.253 --> 22:21.453
Recap?

22:21.487 --> 22:23.255
No. What?
Recap what?

22:23.289 --> 22:24.856
Your asinine plan

22:24.924 --> 22:28.527
to educate our daughter
on the perils of drug abuse?

22:28.561 --> 22:29.928
Okay, well maybe my plan

22:29.963 --> 22:31.530
didn't go exactly according
to plan,

22:31.564 --> 22:33.198
but maybe it did.
Maybe I'm a fucking genius.

22:33.232 --> 22:35.100
Or maybe we just went up there

22:35.134 --> 22:38.136
so you could see her.
Who, Natalie?

22:38.171 --> 22:40.973
Oh, God. Karen.

22:41.007 --> 22:42.441
Why are you shitting
where I eat?

22:42.475 --> 22:43.709
Well, that's disgusting.

22:43.743 --> 22:45.143
That's disgusting?

22:45.178 --> 22:47.613
What--you--like your hands
all over her--

22:47.647 --> 22:48.880
Oh, she practically
forced me to do it.

22:48.915 --> 22:50.115
- Really?
- Yes, and who am I

22:50.149 --> 22:51.483
to pass up a perfectly pleasant

22:51.551 --> 22:53.752
boob grab?
She--it was my hostess.

22:53.786 --> 22:54.953
It would have been rude
for a guest to--

22:54.988 --> 22:56.254
are you jealous?

22:56.289 --> 22:59.992
No. No, I'm not.

23:00.026 --> 23:01.526
I'm pissed.

23:01.561 --> 23:03.095
I'm pissed because
you're screwing up

23:03.129 --> 23:04.596
the only job I have right now.

23:04.631 --> 23:05.992
Karen, the woman
is--is practically

23:05.999 --> 23:07.666
hurling herself at me.
Oh!

23:07.700 --> 23:09.501
She's unhappy, I guess.
You know, it's like

23:09.535 --> 23:11.470
a freak show over there.
Who can blame her?

23:11.504 --> 23:13.438
And apparently, I'm a real man.

23:13.473 --> 23:14.740
From the real world.

23:14.774 --> 23:16.842
Right.

23:16.876 --> 23:20.012
So you're the perfect guy
to ease her pain and suffering.

23:20.046 --> 23:21.613
It's not my fault.

23:21.648 --> 23:23.315
It's like I emit this strange
kind of homing

23:23.349 --> 23:26.151
beacon for these malcontents.
You're amazing.

23:26.185 --> 23:27.619
No, no, and I don't want
to have anything to do

23:27.654 --> 23:29.321
with her, Karen...
Mmhmm.

23:29.355 --> 23:30.622
Which makes perfect sense,
because the person that I

23:30.657 --> 23:31.923
want to have everything
to do with

23:31.958 --> 23:35.027
wants nothing to do with me.

23:35.061 --> 23:36.328
Oh, good.

23:36.362 --> 23:39.598
Well, we agree on something.
Oh.

23:39.632 --> 23:43.602
- Good night.
- Good night.

23:51.411 --> 23:53.378
Ahh.

23:53.413 --> 23:56.548
- Oh, my God.
- Mm.

23:56.582 --> 23:58.483
Ugh!

23:58.518 --> 24:00.619
Ophelia is gonna
be so pissed at me.

24:00.653 --> 24:02.554
Ophelia!

24:02.588 --> 24:05.490
We have sex for
the first time in years...

24:05.525 --> 24:06.792
- Mm.
- And this is the first thought

24:06.826 --> 24:08.026
to cross your mind?

24:08.061 --> 24:09.461
Mmhmm.

24:09.495 --> 24:12.664
So...

24:12.699 --> 24:14.566
How was it for you?

24:14.600 --> 24:16.935
- It was okay.
- Okay?

24:16.969 --> 24:20.105
Well, that's a--
that's a start, I guess.

24:20.139 --> 24:22.841
It was familiar...

24:22.875 --> 24:25.177
In a not-entirely
unpleasant way.

24:25.211 --> 24:27.012
Oh.

24:27.046 --> 24:30.916
And you lasted almost long
enough for mommy to get hers.

24:30.950 --> 24:32.818
I know, how cool was that,
right?

24:32.852 --> 24:35.353
I think it's because I blew some
serious yolk already today.

24:35.388 --> 24:36.588
Gross.

24:36.622 --> 24:38.724
Where?
Here.

24:38.758 --> 24:39.991
In the shower.

24:40.059 --> 24:41.393
It's my daily ritual.

24:41.427 --> 24:44.296
You remember.
Yes.

24:44.330 --> 24:46.765
So how was the fucking fun zone?

24:46.799 --> 24:48.867
Oh, I found
it seriously frightening.

24:48.901 --> 24:51.470
- Mm-hmm.
- There was this one mom--

24:51.504 --> 24:54.239
Oh! Tricia.

24:54.273 --> 24:55.674
Yeah, how did you know?

24:55.708 --> 24:59.044
Because, everybody
knows about Tricia.

24:59.078 --> 25:01.546
She tries to fuck all the dads.

25:01.581 --> 25:03.515
She's got this website.

25:03.549 --> 25:07.152
It's called "Housewife Hannah."

25:07.186 --> 25:09.488
Wait.

25:09.522 --> 25:10.722
Did you do something with her?

25:10.757 --> 25:12.524
No.

25:12.558 --> 25:15.060
- Mm?
- God.

25:15.094 --> 25:16.328
Okay.

25:16.362 --> 25:18.029
Here, check this out.

25:18.064 --> 25:20.132
Oh, my God.

25:20.166 --> 25:22.134
Jesus!

25:22.168 --> 25:24.269
Look at that guy.

25:24.303 --> 25:26.805
He's such a fucking tool.

25:26.839 --> 25:29.307
Then you're gonna give
me a big messy facial.

25:29.342 --> 25:32.110
All over my glasses.
Oh, Jesus.

25:32.145 --> 25:35.714
I'd know that bent fucking
chode anywhere.

25:37.250 --> 25:38.884
- Nice.
- Ah, oh.

25:38.918 --> 25:40.952
Oh, God.

25:40.987 --> 25:42.220
Aah!

25:42.255 --> 25:45.624
Ah! Aah!

25:50.163 --> 25:52.430
Dad.

25:52.465 --> 25:53.765
Daughter.

25:53.800 --> 25:57.302
Is that what I think it is?

25:57.336 --> 25:58.837
It sure is.

25:58.871 --> 26:01.540
Would you mind taking a look?
Of course.

26:01.574 --> 26:03.742
I'd be honored.

26:03.776 --> 26:05.744
Whoa.

26:05.778 --> 26:07.012
It's quite the weighty tome.

26:07.046 --> 26:08.980
Words, words, words.

26:09.015 --> 26:12.350
Congratulations, sweetie.

26:12.385 --> 26:16.087
You know, whether it's good,
bad, or somewhere in between,

26:16.122 --> 26:19.024
this is a huge accomplishment.
Huge.

26:19.058 --> 26:20.759
Why would you assume it's bad?

26:20.793 --> 26:23.161
Spoken like a true writer.

26:27.333 --> 26:29.100
Mm.

26:29.135 --> 26:30.335
Are you okay?

26:30.369 --> 26:33.104
Yeah.

26:33.139 --> 26:36.341
Just for a moment there,
it was...

26:36.375 --> 26:39.444
Like everything was all right
in the world again.

26:39.478 --> 26:42.814
Seemed like old times.

26:42.849 --> 26:44.015
I love you, Dad.

26:44.050 --> 26:48.520
I love you too, sweetheart.

26:48.554 --> 26:49.788
Be careful, okay?

26:49.822 --> 26:52.023
I will, Dad.

26:52.058 --> 26:53.458
I promise.
