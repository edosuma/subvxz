03:17.168 --> 03:18.085
- You okay?

03:19.180 --> 03:20.013
- I'm just great.

03:20.013 --> 03:21.063
Looking at the sky.

03:27.750 --> 03:29.560
- Here, let me help you up.

03:29.560 --> 03:30.847
- I don't want to get up.

03:37.700 --> 03:39.640
- I thought you fell.

03:39.640 --> 03:40.790
- No, just laying here.

03:45.190 --> 03:46.023
- Okay.

03:49.240 --> 03:50.390
- What are you wearing?

03:55.670 --> 03:57.200
- My clogs.

03:57.200 --> 03:58.330
- Haven't seen that before.

03:58.330 --> 03:59.163
You a chef?

04:01.210 --> 04:02.670
- No.

04:02.670 --> 04:04.270
- Then why are you wearing them?

04:06.688 --> 04:08.240
- I don't know, I like them.

04:08.240 --> 04:09.710
I got 'em in art school.

04:09.710 --> 04:10.543
- Far out.

04:17.870 --> 04:18.913
My name's Liz.

04:21.820 --> 04:22.653
- Will.

04:23.920 --> 04:24.753
- Hi, Will.

04:27.800 --> 04:28.633
- Hi.

04:31.490 --> 04:32.930
- You gonna come lay here next to me

04:32.930 --> 04:34.980
and look at the sky or are you moving on?

04:37.376 --> 04:39.420
- I was actually going to
sit on that bench over there,

04:39.420 --> 04:41.833
before I saw you laying here.

04:43.070 --> 04:43.903
- Oh, cool.

04:51.710 --> 04:52.543
- Okay.

04:53.640 --> 04:54.513
- Okay, Will.

05:27.656 --> 05:28.823
Whatcha doing?

05:33.998 --> 05:34.831
- I...

05:37.075 --> 05:38.992
- What are you drawing?

05:42.470 --> 05:46.220
- I was actually gonna draw
this building over here.

05:46.220 --> 05:47.080
- Nice view.

05:55.564 --> 05:56.564
Show me how.

05:59.886 --> 06:01.987
- Okay.

06:01.987 --> 06:05.070
I work at this art gallery
on Thirds Street Promenade.

06:05.070 --> 06:06.500
It's unimportant really.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.900
- So you haven't had
a gallery showing yet?

06:08.900 --> 06:09.897
- No, nothing like that.

06:09.897 --> 06:13.520
I just like to draw and I paint sometimes.

06:13.520 --> 06:14.520
- Like a cartoonist.

06:15.420 --> 06:17.216
- Yeah, I guess you could say that.

06:17.216 --> 06:18.536
- You're not a cartoonist.

06:18.536 --> 06:19.600
- No.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.730
I just like to sketch
and I draw sometimes.

06:21.730 --> 06:22.563
- Yeah?

06:25.280 --> 06:26.440
- How about you?

06:26.440 --> 06:27.870
What's your story?

06:27.870 --> 06:29.470
- I got here a month ago.

06:29.470 --> 06:31.360
From Oregon.

06:31.360 --> 06:34.140
Staying in a house with three other girls.

06:34.140 --> 06:36.850
Got a job as a server, start tomorrow.

06:36.850 --> 06:38.640
Thought I'd spend today
looking up at the sky

06:38.640 --> 06:40.755
if I'm gonna be indoors for awhile.

06:40.755 --> 06:42.313
- Yeah.

06:42.313 --> 06:43.710
So where is it, where do you work?

06:43.710 --> 06:45.383
- Station 39, over in Culver.

06:46.344 --> 06:47.177
- Oh.

06:47.177 --> 06:48.680
I think I've been there like once.

06:48.680 --> 06:49.588
- Yeah?

06:49.588 --> 06:50.430
- Yeah.

06:50.430 --> 06:52.370
- But I figure I'll do this for a while,

06:52.370 --> 06:53.800
figure out what to do next.

06:53.800 --> 06:54.993
Keep my options open.

06:56.150 --> 06:57.200
- That's a good idea.

06:58.980 --> 07:01.090
- You're from around here, right?

07:01.090 --> 07:02.520
- Yeah, born and raised here.

07:02.520 --> 07:04.843
- So what's it like to grow up here?

07:05.896 --> 07:07.993
- I don't know, you know, it's LA.

07:09.050 --> 07:11.200
Things never really
stay the same for long.

07:12.926 --> 07:15.050
And I got this tech
company that just moved in,

07:15.050 --> 07:16.810
they're buying up all these buildings.

07:16.810 --> 07:18.155
Ruining the community.

07:20.064 --> 07:23.370
But gentrification, I guess.

07:23.370 --> 07:25.373
But I mean, it's LA.

07:26.910 --> 07:27.743
- Okay.

07:29.990 --> 07:32.440
So what have you got
planned the rest of the day?

07:34.223 --> 07:35.173
- I don't know.

07:35.173 --> 07:37.990
I don't work till tomorrow either.

07:37.990 --> 07:39.480
I was at home doing some sketches earlier

07:39.480 --> 07:43.219
and I figured why not get out
and enjoy some fresh air too?

07:43.219 --> 07:44.052
- Yeah.

07:46.024 --> 07:49.084
I bet you can do a great
tap dance in those shoes.

07:55.790 --> 07:56.623
- Thank you.

07:56.623 --> 07:57.747
- You're welcome.

07:57.747 --> 07:58.580
So good.

07:58.580 --> 07:59.413
- Need a little work.

07:59.413 --> 08:01.175
- Maybe some tap lessons.

08:01.175 --> 08:03.565
- Throw that in with some
drawing classes, we're good.

08:03.565 --> 08:04.398
- You'll be good to go.

08:04.398 --> 08:06.860
- Yeah, I could draw with my...

08:06.860 --> 08:09.552
- Oh, oh, look at you,
an artist with your feet.

08:09.552 --> 08:10.385
- There you go.

08:10.385 --> 08:12.422
- You could start a new
thing right here in Venice.

08:12.422 --> 08:15.440
- Right here on the boardwalk in the sand.

08:15.440 --> 08:16.273
- I'd come.

08:16.273 --> 08:17.106
- I'll draw pictures.

08:18.135 --> 08:23.135
- Okay.

08:23.723 --> 08:24.556
You hungry?

08:24.556 --> 08:25.535
- Let's have a drink, yes.

08:25.535 --> 08:28.086
- Okay, good.
- Let's go.

09:07.770 --> 09:10.240
- Well, it was nice spending
the day with you, Will.

09:10.240 --> 09:11.830
- You too, Liz.

09:11.830 --> 09:13.720
- You on social media?

09:13.720 --> 09:15.070
- No, I'm not.

09:15.070 --> 09:15.903
- I should've guessed,

09:15.903 --> 09:18.210
with you looking like a folk
singer in those strange clogs,

09:18.210 --> 09:19.070
and that hat and beard.

09:19.070 --> 09:20.480
I just wanna download your latest album,

09:20.480 --> 09:23.176
but of course, you're not on social media.

09:23.176 --> 09:24.790
- You think my clogs are strange?

09:24.790 --> 09:26.400
What about that shirt, Janice Joplin?

09:26.400 --> 09:28.570
- Strange is good sometimes.

09:28.570 --> 09:29.670
- Okay, I'll take that.

09:29.670 --> 09:30.620
- Text me sometime?

09:31.620 --> 09:32.453
- I will.

09:34.010 --> 09:36.500
- Oh, by the way, I don't drive,

09:36.500 --> 09:37.856
so if you ever want to
ask me out on a date,

09:37.856 --> 09:38.689
I hope you can take us.

09:38.689 --> 09:39.522
- I don't drive either.

09:40.410 --> 09:42.467
The mass transit system
here is good enough for me.

09:42.467 --> 09:43.416
- Bye, Will.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.333
- Bye, Liz.

09:59.547 --> 10:01.214
- Shit, I'm so lost.

10:25.390 --> 10:26.520
- Hey, Liz.

10:26.520 --> 10:27.353
It's Will.

10:28.750 --> 10:33.510
I really enjoyed spending
the day with you.

10:33.510 --> 10:36.113
Are you free tomorrow evening?

10:37.210 --> 10:39.313
Care to go on an adventure?

11:32.350 --> 11:33.950
Do you like art?

11:33.950 --> 11:35.340
- That's a random question.

11:35.340 --> 11:37.160
I don't know.

11:37.160 --> 11:38.680
I guess.

11:38.680 --> 11:41.130
I suppose it's what you
would consider to be art.

11:42.250 --> 11:44.110
- We're going to an art crawl downtown.

11:44.110 --> 11:46.060
That's the reason why I was asking you.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.260
- Do I like that mural?

11:49.260 --> 11:50.930
Sure, I'd say that's cool.

11:50.930 --> 11:52.380
But I don't know if it's art.

11:53.700 --> 11:54.533
- Oh that's art.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.150
LA is filled with that.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.330
- Okay.

11:58.330 --> 11:59.530
Well, what's art to you?

12:01.560 --> 12:02.393
- Edward Hopper.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.230
I was fascinated by his
work when I was a kid.

12:06.230 --> 12:07.680
- I think I know who that is.

12:11.060 --> 12:12.880
- That's Edward Hopper.

12:12.880 --> 12:14.100
Night Hawks.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.360
He was a master of
capturing what it feels like

12:16.360 --> 12:18.450
to be all alone in this world.

12:18.450 --> 12:19.283
- Okay.

12:19.283 --> 12:20.960
I know who you're talking about.

12:20.960 --> 12:22.093
Yes, that's art.

12:23.520 --> 12:24.973
Or The Mona Lisa, I guess.

12:26.430 --> 12:27.780
- The Mona Lisa?

12:27.780 --> 12:28.613
- What?

12:30.350 --> 12:31.560
- Hey.

12:31.560 --> 12:32.770
The Mona Lisa.

12:32.770 --> 12:33.603
- What about it?

12:34.550 --> 12:36.723
- You've just given me an idea, actually.

12:39.940 --> 12:41.230
- Please stand clear.

12:41.230 --> 12:42.353
The doors are closing.

13:30.936 --> 13:31.853
- So what kind of artist
did you want to be

13:31.853 --> 13:32.993
when you were starting out?

13:32.993 --> 13:36.080
Like what we just saw or Edward Hopper?

13:36.080 --> 13:39.460
- No, I really liked a
couple local artists.

13:39.460 --> 13:41.780
Ed Moses and Craig Kauffman.

13:41.780 --> 13:43.673
Their styles really appealed to me.

13:44.568 --> 13:47.810
Then I started experimenting
with different concepts,

13:47.810 --> 13:50.210
meshing different styles
and movements together.

13:51.120 --> 13:51.953
But then they said

13:51.953 --> 13:54.370
that my paintings weren't original enough,

13:54.370 --> 13:57.460
that my sources of
inspiration were too obvious.

13:57.460 --> 13:58.696
- Who kept saying?

13:58.696 --> 14:01.507
- The others at art school.

14:01.507 --> 14:02.340
- Oh.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.430
- So I took a different turn.

14:10.430 --> 14:12.533
More abstract, I guess you could say.

14:13.600 --> 14:16.083
I try to paint things within my reach,

14:17.030 --> 14:18.430
and try to make discoveries.

14:19.387 --> 14:22.850
The challenge is to work
against simply "succeeding".

14:22.850 --> 14:25.520
The more the painting eludes control

14:25.520 --> 14:27.233
and loses its calculated options,

14:28.130 --> 14:33.027
the closer I feel to a
formulation that feels "right".

14:33.870 --> 14:36.073
- Wow, that's very thought out.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.400
- I've had a lot of
time to think about it.

14:40.400 --> 14:41.990
- No, but seriously.

14:41.990 --> 14:43.520
You've got all that shit worked out,

14:43.520 --> 14:45.960
and these are just your
thoughts on painting.

14:45.960 --> 14:49.180
I don't have anything in
my life figured out at all.

14:49.180 --> 14:51.330
I'm just walking through life blindly,

14:51.330 --> 14:53.030
hoping it'll all make sense to me.

14:54.530 --> 14:57.230
- Well, you gotta have
some ambitions or goals

14:57.230 --> 14:58.230
or something, right?

14:59.290 --> 15:00.240
Everybody has them.

15:01.250 --> 15:04.410
- I suppose I always wanted
to open up an organic farm,

15:04.410 --> 15:05.990
and hook up with some environmentalists

15:05.990 --> 15:07.760
and go completely off the grid.

15:07.760 --> 15:09.390
- That's interesting.

15:09.390 --> 15:11.030
Environmentalism.

15:11.030 --> 15:12.720
We sure do need it.

15:12.720 --> 15:14.360
- Yeah, but instead I chose to move

15:14.360 --> 15:16.010
to the biggest city on the West Coast

15:16.010 --> 15:19.210
filled with overpopulation
and pollution and traffic

15:19.210 --> 15:21.250
and loud flashing lights.

15:21.250 --> 15:22.400
- That's what we pay for in exchange

15:22.400 --> 15:24.600
for all the sunshine,
the beaches, and weed.

15:25.580 --> 15:27.430
- Yeah, I've done nothing
to save the environment.

15:27.430 --> 15:28.573
So go figure that out.

15:29.559 --> 15:30.609
- You still got time.

15:33.250 --> 15:35.959
Don't be so hard on yourself, Liz.

15:35.959 --> 15:37.240
- So where'd you go to Art School?

15:37.240 --> 15:38.430
Here in LA?

15:38.430 --> 15:40.780
- No, I got outta here as soon as I could.

15:40.780 --> 15:44.339
Right after high school, I
ran and I studied abroad.

15:44.339 --> 15:46.270
I lived in Germany for five years.

15:46.270 --> 15:47.103
- Wow.

15:47.103 --> 15:48.380
I've never been to Europe.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.850
You totally went after
every fancy European girl

15:51.850 --> 15:53.930
you laid your eyes on, huh?

15:53.930 --> 15:55.510
It's okay, don't deny it.

15:55.510 --> 15:58.273
- No, not every one.

15:58.273 --> 15:59.277
No, but to just go there

15:59.277 --> 16:01.530
and to just be left to my own devices

16:01.530 --> 16:03.280
and to just be there.

16:04.602 --> 16:06.443
It was amazing.

16:07.710 --> 16:08.863
Europe's nice.

16:09.930 --> 16:11.183
Like, very nice.

16:12.510 --> 16:14.110
That's where my clogs came from.

16:15.080 --> 16:16.440
Everybody in art school wore them.

16:17.273 --> 16:18.430
Just can't get rid of them.

16:20.380 --> 16:24.130
I used to take the train from Frankfurt,

16:24.130 --> 16:25.180
to Munich, to Berlin.

16:26.330 --> 16:28.750
Sometimes I'd head over to Paris.

16:28.750 --> 16:29.900
London a few times too.

16:30.920 --> 16:33.413
Take the bullet train
underneath the English Channel.

16:35.510 --> 16:36.343
Good old days.

16:37.200 --> 16:38.700
- So can you speak any German?

16:44.242 --> 16:45.075
What did you say?

16:45.075 --> 16:46.430
What does that mean?

16:46.430 --> 16:48.330
- It means I think you're very pretty.

16:55.300 --> 16:57.300
- Shit, I always wanted to go to Europe.

16:58.160 --> 16:59.510
Never had the money though.

17:00.450 --> 17:01.573
There and New York.

17:02.640 --> 17:04.130
Instead I moved here.

17:04.130 --> 17:05.650
It was closer to home.

17:05.650 --> 17:06.750
Why did you come back?

17:08.480 --> 17:10.410
- I thought I could make it work.

17:10.410 --> 17:13.772
Get my own studio, get
showcased at a couple galleries,

17:15.079 --> 17:16.970
and then I got a job to live.

17:16.970 --> 17:18.710
And that's all I've been really doing.

17:18.710 --> 17:20.400
- But you said you draw?

17:20.400 --> 17:21.858
- Yeah, I mean, in my sketchbooks,

17:21.858 --> 17:23.137
but that doesn't really
count now, does it?

17:23.137 --> 17:25.480
That's not what I came back here to do.

17:25.480 --> 17:27.813
- So who is stopping you
from doing what you want?

17:28.920 --> 17:29.793
Paint, damn it!

17:35.900 --> 17:37.950
- Has anybody ever painted your portrait?

17:39.270 --> 17:41.880
- Jimmy Russo in the 11th
grade said he was going

17:41.880 --> 17:44.420
to have my face tattooed on his leg

17:44.420 --> 17:46.570
so every day he could
look down and see me.

17:47.410 --> 17:49.060
I don't think that counts though.

17:50.778 --> 17:52.389
- Did he ever get the tattoo?

17:52.389 --> 17:54.178
- No, thank god.

17:54.178 --> 17:55.630
That would have been horrible,

17:55.630 --> 17:58.020
to have my face permanently
inked onto someone's leg.

17:58.020 --> 18:02.503
Not even on his chest, like
a pirate, but on his leg?

18:04.457 --> 18:06.643
Oh god, what a weird story.

18:08.080 --> 18:10.250
- I wonder where he is now.

18:10.250 --> 18:11.193
- Oh, lord knows.

18:12.430 --> 18:13.263
- Probably Texas.

18:13.263 --> 18:14.096
- Texas?

18:16.170 --> 18:17.003
What's up in Texas?

18:17.003 --> 18:18.650
- That's where all the big boys are.

18:20.101 --> 18:22.701
- I guess he is a
big boy, with a big calf.

19:09.868 --> 19:12.735
- The train to
Port Hollywood is arriving.

19:12.735 --> 19:15.743
Please stand back from
the edge of the platform.

20:19.830 --> 20:20.900
- Hey!

20:20.900 --> 20:21.733
- Hey there.

20:21.733 --> 20:23.810
- You didn't answer my earlier calls.

20:23.810 --> 20:25.167
- Sorry about that, I was at work.

20:25.167 --> 20:26.960
- Oh, I should have thought of that.

20:26.960 --> 20:28.140
- What's up?

20:28.140 --> 20:29.670
- We're having a party over at my house,

20:29.670 --> 20:32.003
my roommates are doing
Taco Tuesday El Grande!

20:33.520 --> 20:34.353
- What's that?

20:34.353 --> 20:35.290
- I don't know!

20:35.290 --> 20:36.123
Come over!

20:37.090 --> 20:37.923
- Alright.

20:37.923 --> 20:39.840
Okay, yeah, give me an hour.

20:39.840 --> 20:42.530
Let me change and shower,
I'll be right over.

20:42.530 --> 20:43.363
- Okay.

20:45.600 --> 20:46.983
Ladies, this is Will.

20:48.234 --> 20:50.870
- Hi, Will.
- Hi, Will.

20:50.870 --> 20:52.370
- Hello.

20:52.370 --> 20:54.300
- That's Denise, that's Shelly.

20:54.300 --> 20:55.490
Ellie who owns the place isn't here,

20:55.490 --> 20:57.695
she had her period and ran
to her boyfriend's, I think.

20:59.010 --> 21:00.260
- Okay.

21:00.260 --> 21:01.093
- Sit.

21:02.135 --> 21:03.244
There you go.
- There you go.

21:03.244 --> 21:06.250
- Oh, he's a drinker as well!

21:07.850 --> 21:10.090
- He kind of interrupted
my peace that I was having

21:10.090 --> 21:11.300
on the ground.

21:11.300 --> 21:12.506
- You interrupted her peace?

21:12.506 --> 21:14.586
- Yeah, before I started work--

21:14.586 --> 21:15.787
- I thought she fell.

21:15.787 --> 21:17.070
- You thought, okay, hold on.

21:17.070 --> 21:19.860
- I was clearly lying down.

21:19.860 --> 21:21.447
- Liz, you're such a klutz.

21:21.447 --> 21:23.007
- Well, your bike was turned upside down.

21:23.007 --> 21:23.910
I was walking through the park,

21:23.910 --> 21:27.440
I was gonna go sketch, and
your bike was upside down

21:27.440 --> 21:28.900
and she was laying there under the tree

21:28.900 --> 21:30.650
and I thought she was hurt.

21:30.650 --> 21:32.920
- Her bike was upside down.

21:32.920 --> 21:33.868
- Well...

21:33.868 --> 21:34.938
- How did you configure that?

21:34.938 --> 21:35.786
You were just like...

21:35.786 --> 21:36.990
- I used it as a pillow!

21:36.990 --> 21:38.058
It made total sense to me.

21:38.058 --> 21:38.920
- Well, I guess it wasn't upside down,

21:38.920 --> 21:39.866
it was like on the side.

21:39.866 --> 21:40.746
- A pillow?

21:40.746 --> 21:42.027
That's the most uncomfortable
pillow in the world.

21:42.027 --> 21:44.360
Of course he thought you fell down!

21:44.360 --> 21:46.450
- Okay, it was really sweet, I know.

21:46.450 --> 21:47.470
- Thank you, ladies.

21:47.470 --> 21:48.335
- You're welcome.

21:50.030 --> 21:52.858
- Okay, so then he just
came up and was like?

21:52.858 --> 21:54.358
- Then we had a...

21:55.258 --> 21:56.415
- I'm sorry, what?

21:56.415 --> 21:57.670
- Then we had a date.

21:57.670 --> 21:58.890
- And then you had a date.

21:58.890 --> 21:59.723
- We had a day together.

21:59.723 --> 22:00.839
- You had that little eyebrow thing.

22:00.839 --> 22:02.647
- Showed her Venice.

22:06.966 --> 22:08.216
- His pieces...

22:11.060 --> 22:12.410
- Hey, Will, get me a beer?

22:13.677 --> 22:14.510
- Sure.

22:17.055 --> 22:18.780
- Does it have any left in it?

22:18.780 --> 22:19.613
- I think so.

22:20.615 --> 22:21.448
- Okay.

22:24.020 --> 22:25.660
- Come with me.

22:25.660 --> 22:26.493
I need you.

22:32.480 --> 22:33.797
- Yes!

22:33.797 --> 22:35.920
We only have this one paintbrush...

22:57.441 --> 22:59.024
- Kiss me a little.

23:28.049 --> 23:29.007
- Jesus.

23:29.007 --> 23:30.010
Are you okay?

23:30.010 --> 23:30.860
- No.

23:30.860 --> 23:31.693
It's...

23:31.693 --> 23:32.526
- Wait, did I?

23:35.846 --> 23:36.679
Oh.

23:43.460 --> 23:44.293
Liz?

23:45.292 --> 23:47.403
I'm coming in.

23:52.800 --> 23:53.633
You okay?

24:02.960 --> 24:04.843
- Hey, thank you.

24:07.142 --> 24:08.225
- No problem.

24:10.102 --> 24:12.410
Well, I guess I should get going.

24:12.410 --> 24:13.243
- Stay.

24:14.420 --> 24:15.473
Stay with me.

24:19.950 --> 24:20.783
- I can't.

24:22.240 --> 24:24.030
I have to work in the morning.

24:24.030 --> 24:25.660
- So do I.

24:25.660 --> 24:26.803
In the evening.

24:32.670 --> 24:33.503
- I can't.

24:34.960 --> 24:35.801
I wish I could.

24:35.801 --> 24:36.801
- It's okay.

24:45.620 --> 24:47.100
- Good night.

24:47.100 --> 24:48.683
- Good night, Will.

25:24.850 --> 25:27.760
Hey, thanks again for taking
care of me last night.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.883
I didn't plan to be such a lush.

25:30.870 --> 25:31.703
See you soon?

25:35.650 --> 25:36.940
Nice place.

25:36.940 --> 25:37.773
- Thanks.

25:38.680 --> 25:39.580
Been here a while.

25:43.290 --> 25:44.213
- Is this me?

25:45.860 --> 25:46.693
- Yep.

25:48.281 --> 25:49.114
- Wow.

25:50.340 --> 25:52.250
- It wasn't supposed to be,

25:52.250 --> 25:53.820
but I couldn't get you out
of my head the other day,

25:53.820 --> 25:56.283
so I put you down on paper.

25:57.690 --> 25:58.523
- I like it.

26:00.080 --> 26:00.913
- Thanks.

26:04.290 --> 26:05.943
I'd like to paint your portrait.

26:08.070 --> 26:08.903
- Okay.

26:15.040 --> 26:16.540
- Tell me more about yourself.

26:18.310 --> 26:20.313
- I've already told you
everything about me.

26:22.100 --> 26:23.350
- Tell me more.

26:24.707 --> 26:26.883
- I don't know what else to say.

26:27.930 --> 26:29.233
I'm exactly as you see.

26:30.850 --> 26:33.433
I don't care, I don't bullshit.

26:34.740 --> 26:35.733
I'm an open book.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.100
- You're fun.

26:40.100 --> 26:41.053
- That's all?

26:42.520 --> 26:43.353
- No.

26:47.660 --> 26:49.543
- How many other girls have you been with?

26:51.939 --> 26:53.580
- Like relationship wise?

26:53.580 --> 26:54.593
- Yeah, anything.

26:56.720 --> 26:59.200
- I've had my fair share
of experiences, I guess.

26:59.200 --> 27:00.580
- Come on.

27:00.580 --> 27:01.420
Tell me.

27:01.420 --> 27:04.490
I've told you everything about me already.

27:08.847 --> 27:10.973
- I dated this one girl for a little bit.

27:14.470 --> 27:15.470
Thought it was love.

27:16.942 --> 27:17.775
But...

27:22.667 --> 27:24.453
You know, what does it matter?

27:26.210 --> 27:27.260
This is what matters.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.493
None of them have been
like you, in any way.

27:40.000 --> 27:40.833
- What am I?

27:44.610 --> 27:46.121
- Memorable.

27:58.930 --> 28:01.290
- This is the first time it
feels like I'm back home.

28:01.290 --> 28:03.190
So many trees.

28:03.190 --> 28:05.190
- It's nice to get out of the big city.

28:05.190 --> 28:06.582
- It's crazy to believe we're still there.

28:10.389 --> 28:12.370
I used to have this recurring dream.

28:12.370 --> 28:13.260
It hasn't happened lately,

28:13.260 --> 28:16.080
but I'm wandering through
the woods back home

28:16.080 --> 28:18.123
and it's like a weird kind of twilight.

28:19.400 --> 28:21.350
I don't know if I've
been wandering for hours,

28:21.350 --> 28:22.350
or if I've just got there,

28:22.350 --> 28:24.883
and there's a split in the path.

28:26.180 --> 28:29.150
And I don't know which way
to go, it's left or right,

28:29.150 --> 28:33.283
and I just end up standing
there, trying to decide.

28:35.542 --> 28:37.270
- Well, which way do you take?

28:37.270 --> 28:39.563
- I don't know, I wake up
before I make up my mind.

28:43.250 --> 28:45.050
Do you have any dreams you remember?

28:46.900 --> 28:50.323
- Yeah, I have this one.

28:51.390 --> 28:52.720
I can't really give you the specifics,

28:52.720 --> 28:57.720
but it's like I'm in this like
quicksand and I can't move

29:00.450 --> 29:02.083
and I'm just like stuck there.

29:03.400 --> 29:06.001
And like the quicksand keeps coming up

29:06.001 --> 29:07.530
and I can feel it coming,

29:07.530 --> 29:11.510
but I'm all alone and I have this feeling

29:11.510 --> 29:14.713
of just like a black void.

29:16.960 --> 29:17.793
I don't know, it's weird,

29:17.793 --> 29:19.760
and usually by the time the
quicksand gets up to my waist,

29:19.760 --> 29:22.330
I usually end up waking up anyways.

29:22.330 --> 29:23.163
- Interesting.

29:25.100 --> 29:26.150
- It's weird, I know.

29:27.200 --> 29:28.713
- Dreams, they're weird.

29:39.550 --> 29:41.369
- Give me like two minutes.

29:43.340 --> 29:45.140
Stay normal.

29:45.140 --> 29:46.650
Normal for two minutes.

29:55.992 --> 29:57.491
- That's my best face.

29:57.491 --> 29:58.324
- That's?

30:01.081 --> 30:01.914
Geez.

30:04.150 --> 30:05.961
- How much longer?

30:05.961 --> 30:08.121
- A while.

30:08.121 --> 30:09.367
- Can I get a drink?

30:09.367 --> 30:11.117
- There it is.

30:34.760 --> 30:35.593
- Hey!

30:37.224 --> 30:38.823
- Hey yourself.

30:40.346 --> 30:41.800
Happy longest day of the year.

30:41.800 --> 30:44.030
- Happy longest day of
the year to you too.

30:44.030 --> 30:45.730
- I always felt one should
do something special

30:45.730 --> 30:47.100
on the longest day of the year,

30:47.100 --> 30:48.860
something fun and celebratory.

30:48.860 --> 30:51.150
- Like what did you have in mind?

30:51.150 --> 30:52.460
- I don't know.

30:52.460 --> 30:53.293
But I'm with you,

30:53.293 --> 30:55.450
so that's pretty much
as good as it can get.

30:55.450 --> 30:58.377
- We could make love, that
would make it even better.

30:58.377 --> 31:00.188
- That would.

31:56.733 --> 31:57.603
- Hey, Will.

31:59.250 --> 32:00.613
- Yeah?

32:00.613 --> 32:02.213
- I'm not wearing any underwear.

32:06.013 --> 32:06.846
- Liz!

32:53.824 --> 32:55.290
Do you ever want kids?

32:55.290 --> 32:56.820
- No.

32:56.820 --> 32:59.220
Your life's over when you have kids.

32:59.220 --> 33:00.403
You're stuck.

33:01.320 --> 33:02.153
Besides, look at this world.

33:02.153 --> 33:03.900
Do we really want to
bring more people into it?

33:03.900 --> 33:05.363
It's all crashing down.

33:06.253 --> 33:08.203
- You could always bring
some good ones into it.

33:12.780 --> 33:16.090
- I always loved wandering the
streets really late at night.

33:16.090 --> 33:17.373
I did it all the time.

33:18.460 --> 33:20.390
I loved looking into the quietness

33:20.390 --> 33:21.950
and stillness of the streets.

33:21.950 --> 33:25.640
And sometimes I'd get in the
middle of one and lay down,

33:25.640 --> 33:27.700
pretending I'm all alone.

33:27.700 --> 33:29.103
It's a strange feeling.

33:30.530 --> 33:31.810
- You're crazy.

33:31.810 --> 33:34.050
- No I'm not, I'm impulsive.

33:34.050 --> 33:35.661
Yep.

33:37.535 --> 33:38.520
- Come on, what are you doing?

33:38.520 --> 33:39.460
- Come on, come here.

33:39.460 --> 33:41.146
It feels so good.

33:50.460 --> 33:51.740
- It does feel pretty good.

33:51.740 --> 33:52.573
- It's great.

34:02.850 --> 34:04.523
Do you think you could be a hippie?

34:06.180 --> 34:09.503
I mean, you already dress and
look like one, but just go.

34:10.525 --> 34:13.560
Just up and leave, and live on the road,

34:13.560 --> 34:17.753
make your way, paint as
you go and join a commune,

34:18.710 --> 34:21.393
a community that lives
off the earth and is free?

34:24.420 --> 34:25.719
- My parents were hippies,

34:27.210 --> 34:28.510
real ones back in the day.

34:30.310 --> 34:33.860
I don't think it turns out
as well as you imagine.

34:33.860 --> 34:34.909
- Where are they now?

34:35.960 --> 34:37.661
- They live in Palm Desert.

34:37.661 --> 34:39.572
- I don't know where
that is, that sounds far.

34:40.496 --> 34:41.873
- It's a bit of a drive.

34:41.873 --> 34:44.630
Just a couple hours outside of LA.

34:44.630 --> 34:45.463
- I see.

34:50.621 --> 34:54.989
- But yeah, much as I
think living off the road

34:54.989 --> 34:57.143
and everything sounds really good,

34:58.514 --> 35:01.723
I just don't think it's for me.

35:03.223 --> 35:05.523
I think I'd rather go
back to Germany instead.

35:08.770 --> 35:12.210
Besides, how are we
gonna live off the road?

35:12.210 --> 35:13.623
Neither of us drive.

35:19.620 --> 35:22.113
- You have a much nicer bed than I do.

35:23.424 --> 35:24.923
I could lay in it all day.

35:25.970 --> 35:26.803
- You can.

35:27.940 --> 35:28.773
- I can't.

35:29.730 --> 35:30.960
I have to work at four.

35:32.440 --> 35:36.584
I start bartending tonight,
no more serving wench!

35:36.584 --> 35:37.417
- Really?

35:38.430 --> 35:39.263
Congrats.

35:40.432 --> 35:42.560
You never told me earlier.

35:42.560 --> 35:44.660
- I didn't want to think about it earlier.

35:47.930 --> 35:49.160
I'll make a few more tips

35:49.160 --> 35:51.370
and it'll be easier to get off a few days

35:51.370 --> 35:53.800
so I can go back to the
big OR and see my folks

35:53.800 --> 35:54.800
for a few days.

35:59.760 --> 36:00.593
- I can come.

36:01.980 --> 36:03.790
I'd love to meet your folks.

36:03.790 --> 36:06.513
- No, my family is crazy.

36:08.120 --> 36:09.620
I don't want you meeting them.

36:10.720 --> 36:15.543
I don't want them meeting you, yet.

36:18.310 --> 36:20.510
I'll only be gone for a few days.

36:20.510 --> 36:21.723
We'll talk all the time.

36:26.490 --> 36:27.323
- I love you.

37:16.360 --> 37:18.030
- Hey Will, I'm
on the flight to Eugene.

37:18.030 --> 37:19.960
I'll see you in a couple of days.

37:19.960 --> 37:21.590
Don't miss me too much.

37:21.590 --> 37:22.480
See you soon!

37:22.480 --> 37:24.010
Love, Liz.

37:46.360 --> 37:48.920
- Hey, Liz, it's Will again.

37:48.920 --> 37:51.630
Just wanted to call to see if you made it.

37:51.630 --> 37:54.800
I haven't got a text or
haven't heard from you at all.

37:54.800 --> 37:55.840
I'm a little worried.

37:55.840 --> 37:58.570
I just want to know that you made it.

37:58.570 --> 38:00.793
Can you just call me back
please when you get this?

38:01.909 --> 38:02.742
Bye.

38:34.098 --> 38:36.370
You didn't even call!

38:36.370 --> 38:37.580
How could you not even call me?

38:37.580 --> 38:38.648
- Well I was going to.

38:38.648 --> 38:39.910
I got busy.

38:39.910 --> 38:40.743
I'm sorry.

38:40.743 --> 38:42.783
- You didn't even text me.

38:42.783 --> 38:44.500
I didn't even know if
you even made it or not.

38:44.500 --> 38:45.333
- Made it or not?

38:45.333 --> 38:46.166
Really, Will?

38:46.166 --> 38:48.060
- I had to check the flights online

38:48.060 --> 38:49.540
just to make sure that you were okay.

38:49.540 --> 38:51.293
- I wasn't even gone that long.

38:52.620 --> 38:54.310
I didn't know it was
that big a deal to you.

38:54.310 --> 38:55.543
- Big deal?

39:01.060 --> 39:02.810
We've been together for six months.

39:04.660 --> 39:06.623
I texted you multiple times.

39:07.500 --> 39:10.223
I don't even know how you
couldn't have even noticed.

39:17.690 --> 39:18.523
- I'm sorry.

39:25.385 --> 39:26.718
I'm sorry, babe.

39:38.310 --> 39:40.053
I'm glad to be back.

40:03.460 --> 40:06.165
- Call next time, please?

40:06.165 --> 40:11.165
- I will.

40:41.896 --> 40:45.085
We should totally do
it in a mall next time.

40:53.866 --> 40:56.310
- It's like a little, like, egg.

40:56.310 --> 40:59.170
You know, and it cracks open,
the little chick comes out.

40:59.170 --> 41:01.980
And if you just draw like a
little face to the chicken.

41:01.980 --> 41:03.645
The little chick, he's super cute.

41:07.490 --> 41:08.440
- See you tomorrow?

41:10.290 --> 41:11.407
- You're working tomorrow, right?

41:11.407 --> 41:13.963
- Yeah, I work the day
shift, I'll be off at six.

41:14.920 --> 41:17.300
- How about I come in and
hang out the last 15 minutes

41:17.300 --> 41:19.870
and afterwards we can go out?

41:19.870 --> 41:21.823
- Okay, I like it.

41:26.020 --> 41:26.853
What?

41:30.250 --> 41:32.350
- Why don't you move in with me?

41:32.350 --> 41:33.183
- Will...

41:34.420 --> 41:35.813
- I wouldn't charge you rent.

41:37.496 --> 41:38.329
- Will.

41:39.386 --> 41:40.469
I don't know.

41:41.487 --> 41:43.503
You know I like my space.

41:44.900 --> 41:47.880
I love escaping over
to you, it's more fun.

41:47.880 --> 41:51.010
I look forward to coming over
and spending days and nights

41:51.010 --> 41:54.493
with you but you know I need
my own hole to crawl back into.

41:56.380 --> 41:57.980
Besides, you do not want
to look at this face

41:57.980 --> 41:59.253
24 hours of every day.

42:01.850 --> 42:02.683
- I could.

42:05.274 --> 42:06.857
- Good night, Will.

42:09.060 --> 42:10.685
- I'm going to think about
you all the way home.

42:10.685 --> 42:11.935
- I bet you do.

42:14.049 --> 42:16.050
Careful, careful!

42:16.050 --> 42:18.030
I'm gonna have to get you some
sneakers like a normal guy.

42:18.030 --> 42:19.600
- You don't want a normal guy.

42:19.600 --> 42:21.000
Just let me be

42:21.000 --> 42:21.833
I'm an artist.

42:21.833 --> 42:24.570
I'm a unique and different
kind of personality.

42:24.570 --> 42:26.120
I don't long to belong

42:27.680 --> 42:29.780
but I want to belong to you.

42:29.780 --> 42:30.893
- Good night, Will.

42:32.111 --> 42:33.194
- Good night.

42:49.870 --> 42:51.296
- Happy Birthday, babe.

42:51.296 --> 42:52.960
- Thanks.

42:52.960 --> 42:53.797
- Make a wish.

42:58.803 --> 43:00.990
I made it all by myself.

43:00.990 --> 43:04.723
And it's got a raw crust,
so I hope you like it.

43:05.597 --> 43:07.400
- What's a raw crust?

43:07.400 --> 43:09.210
- There's no flour or dough.

43:09.210 --> 43:13.890
And it's got a bunch of
unprocessed raw nuts, seeds,

43:13.890 --> 43:15.563
and dried fruit.

43:16.698 --> 43:17.968
- Oh.

43:17.968 --> 43:19.357
- Let's get that out.

43:19.357 --> 43:20.190
- Okay.

43:21.226 --> 43:22.810
- Okay.

43:22.810 --> 43:23.643
- Alright.

43:26.300 --> 43:27.133
There we go.

43:31.720 --> 43:32.553
- Well?

43:34.620 --> 43:35.453
- It's good.

43:36.460 --> 43:37.293
- Really?

43:37.293 --> 43:38.640
You're not bullshitting me?

43:38.640 --> 43:40.523
- No, it's good.

43:40.523 --> 43:43.323
I wouldn't have known any
different had you not told me.

43:44.290 --> 43:45.123
- Really really?

43:46.750 --> 43:47.583
- Really.

43:51.810 --> 43:53.160
Thank you, babe.

43:53.160 --> 43:53.993
- Cool.

43:53.993 --> 43:55.020
Cuz I've been practicing at my place,

43:55.020 --> 43:57.423
making all kinds of vegan food.

43:58.390 --> 44:02.160
I was hoping to make you
some food too, if you want.

44:02.160 --> 44:04.360
You've been making me
so many dinners, so...

44:06.970 --> 44:07.803
- Yeah.

44:08.950 --> 44:11.403
Yeah, that'd be nice.

44:12.950 --> 44:13.783
Thanks, Liz.

44:24.050 --> 44:24.883
- Like it.

44:24.883 --> 44:25.716
- It's good.

44:28.106 --> 44:29.136
- I'm not so good.

44:31.557 --> 44:32.805
- It's good.

44:32.805 --> 44:35.296
- I need water.

44:35.296 --> 44:36.713
Oh god, it's bad.

44:37.615 --> 44:39.656
- No, it's not.

44:39.656 --> 44:40.823
I'm eating it.

44:42.374 --> 44:43.877
- Happy birthday.

44:51.616 --> 44:52.449
Almost.

44:53.352 --> 44:55.495
- Think I'm.

44:55.495 --> 44:58.412
- Yeah,.

44:59.596 --> 45:02.102
- Am I supposed to go
through or something?

45:02.102 --> 45:03.352
This is like...

45:04.842 --> 45:06.092
Okay, let's go.

45:07.162 --> 45:09.745
- Oh.

45:10.711 --> 45:12.461
- Okay, I don't know.

45:13.858 --> 45:17.730
- Okay, no, like this.

46:37.560 --> 46:38.543
Hey I'm sorry.

46:39.500 --> 46:40.333
- It's been like an hour.

46:40.333 --> 46:42.173
- I know, I'm sorry.

46:47.122 --> 46:48.780
Hey.

46:48.780 --> 46:49.613
- Hey.

46:51.402 --> 46:52.902
Come on, let's go.

47:24.231 --> 47:25.564
Merry Christmas.

47:27.602 --> 47:30.019
- I don't know how you do it.

47:44.402 --> 47:45.735
Merry Christmas!

47:48.508 --> 47:49.700
When you were a kid, did you wake up

47:49.700 --> 47:51.413
before everyone else and
race through the halls

47:51.413 --> 47:54.100
and try to tear open all
the presents you got?

47:54.100 --> 47:54.933
- Mm-hm.

47:54.933 --> 47:55.766
- I couldn't wait.

47:55.766 --> 47:56.599
It drove me crazy.

47:56.599 --> 47:59.823
I never got any sleep the night
before, not till I was 14.

48:01.360 --> 48:03.081
I stopped believing pretty late.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.680
- Merry Christmas, babe.

48:05.680 --> 48:07.427
- When'd you stop believing?

48:07.427 --> 48:08.663
- When I was eight.

48:09.907 --> 48:14.083
My buddy at school told me
that Santa wasn't real anymore.

48:15.520 --> 48:18.660
So I went home that night,
I was in the bathtub,

48:18.660 --> 48:21.597
and I was asking my mom if he was real,

48:21.597 --> 48:24.301
and she finally broke down and told me.

48:24.301 --> 48:25.751
- Oh, that's so sad!

48:29.800 --> 48:30.853
It's beautiful out.

48:32.210 --> 48:33.733
The sun is shining.

48:34.800 --> 48:37.610
Means it's perfect for a beach day!

48:37.610 --> 48:39.080
Come on, please.

48:39.080 --> 48:40.470
Come on.

48:40.470 --> 48:41.410
- Okay.

48:41.410 --> 48:42.602
- Okay, come on.

48:42.602 --> 48:43.435
- Okay, let's go.

48:43.435 --> 48:45.243
- I've been waiting all
morning for you to wake up.

48:46.279 --> 48:47.760
It's my favorite
day, don't ruin it.

48:47.760 --> 48:49.379
- Your favorite day, let's go.

48:49.379 --> 48:50.212
Oh, man.

48:52.000 --> 48:52.833
- Good morning.

48:53.682 --> 48:54.515
- I'm up.

49:02.780 --> 49:03.697
- You okay?

49:06.323 --> 49:07.973
Just like he actually rolled out.

49:19.350 --> 49:21.003
It's a nice day for Christmas.

49:22.080 --> 49:23.483
- These California winters.

49:30.082 --> 49:32.132
- Do you ever miss being a kid sometimes?

49:36.311 --> 49:37.261
- I don't think so.

49:39.951 --> 49:41.001
I like it better now.

49:43.500 --> 49:46.163
Yeah, there are things that I do miss.

49:47.271 --> 49:51.163
It just feels easier now.

49:54.140 --> 49:56.443
Plus I don't think I'd like
to relive my childhood.

50:14.510 --> 50:16.060
You know, you get so
excited for Christmas,

50:16.060 --> 50:18.340
but you don't even want to have kids?

50:18.340 --> 50:19.173
- No.

50:27.626 --> 50:30.793
- I think I'd make an interesting dad.

50:41.925 --> 50:42.758
You know?

50:43.990 --> 50:46.663
This is one of the best
Christmases I think I've ever had.

50:48.040 --> 50:49.957
Actually, it is the best.

50:55.125 --> 50:57.300
- The thing that always makes me so sad is

50:57.300 --> 50:59.710
there's so much build up to Christmas.

50:59.710 --> 51:01.257
Now it's over, and then it's New Years,

51:01.257 --> 51:03.583
and two weeks later everyone's
miserable, you know?

51:06.230 --> 51:07.583
Time goes so fast.

51:11.770 --> 51:14.420
- Well, what do you want
to do for New Years?

51:14.420 --> 51:16.270
You want to go to a bar or a party or?

51:16.270 --> 51:18.200
- You were never the one
to mention a bar or party

51:18.200 --> 51:19.100
when we first met.

51:20.250 --> 51:21.447
- You've changed me!

51:24.690 --> 51:26.380
- No, let's stay in.

51:26.380 --> 51:27.880
My housemates are all going
out with their friends

51:27.880 --> 51:30.890
and I'm enjoying this.

51:36.974 --> 51:37.807
- Okay.

55:00.580 --> 55:01.413
- Thanks for dinner.

55:01.413 --> 55:02.823
I'm gonna go check my phone.

55:39.350 --> 55:41.330
Tony's always saying
there's nothing here in LA

55:41.330 --> 55:42.410
that's free entertainment

55:42.410 --> 55:44.037
and I'm just saying "go watch the ocean,

55:44.037 --> 55:46.760
"that's never uninteresting."

55:46.760 --> 55:47.593
- Who's Tony?

55:47.593 --> 55:49.660
- He's just the new bartender at work.

55:49.660 --> 55:51.410
We have a couple shifts together.

55:51.410 --> 55:52.810
It's been weirdly busy, like I told you,

55:52.810 --> 55:55.233
everyone gets depressed
and goes out drinking.

55:56.470 --> 55:58.170
They all try to start
the new year off right,

55:58.170 --> 55:59.920
but nobody can ever follow through.

56:01.840 --> 56:02.840
- We can do something else, I mean--

56:02.840 --> 56:04.500
- I wasn't bullshitting
when I said I like to go

56:04.500 --> 56:05.333
to the ocean.

56:06.780 --> 56:09.120
It's become my favorite thing to do.

56:09.120 --> 56:11.550
Helps me think and straighten out my mind.

56:38.431 --> 56:39.264
Hey.

56:40.150 --> 56:41.784
- Hey.

56:41.784 --> 56:43.510
- What are you doing here?

56:43.510 --> 56:44.840
- Nothing.

56:44.840 --> 56:47.443
Work was slow, so they
decided to close early.

56:47.443 --> 56:50.050
Figured I'd swing by and surprise you.

56:50.050 --> 56:51.250
See what you were up to.

56:52.763 --> 56:54.780
- Want a drink?

56:54.780 --> 56:55.613
- Sure.

56:59.790 --> 57:03.163
So, your friend Tony working today?

57:05.090 --> 57:06.170
- It's slow.

57:06.170 --> 57:07.253
They called Tony off.

57:11.163 --> 57:14.080
Don't forget to tip your bartender.

57:21.549 --> 57:22.382
- Cheers.

58:18.460 --> 58:19.600
- Hey, glad you could make it!

58:19.600 --> 58:20.433
What's up?

58:21.320 --> 58:22.172
- Who was that?

58:22.172 --> 58:23.005
- No one.

58:23.005 --> 58:23.838
Just Shelly's friend from work.

58:23.838 --> 58:24.671
- Liz.

58:26.123 --> 58:26.956
Who was that?

58:26.956 --> 58:29.090
- God, Will, lighten up.

58:29.090 --> 58:30.410
Everything's fine.

58:30.410 --> 58:31.360
Here, have a drink.

58:33.421 --> 58:34.254
- Liz?

58:35.540 --> 58:36.373
What's going on?

58:37.643 --> 58:38.920
We're not the same anymore.

58:38.920 --> 58:39.795
- Nothing's going on.

58:39.795 --> 58:40.628
I don't know.

58:40.628 --> 58:43.628
You're the one all tensed up lately.

59:25.875 --> 59:26.708
- Hi.

59:26.708 --> 59:27.541
- I know I'm late.

59:27.541 --> 59:28.603
- Yeah, you're really late.

59:28.603 --> 59:29.436
- I was stuck at work.

59:29.436 --> 59:31.200
- I went by your work today.

59:31.200 --> 59:32.950
They said that you had the day off.

59:41.310 --> 59:42.640
Liz.

59:42.640 --> 59:43.473
- Will.

59:46.077 --> 59:47.160
Are you still hungry?

59:47.160 --> 59:49.360
Do you want to go to dinner?

59:49.360 --> 59:50.410
- Why, you don't want to?

59:50.410 --> 59:51.243
- Did I say that?

59:51.243 --> 59:52.076
I didn't say that.

59:52.076 --> 59:52.910
I said do you still want to?

59:54.560 --> 59:55.410
- Where were you?

59:56.810 --> 59:58.223
- I have my own life, Will.

59:59.450 --> 01:00:01.240
I don't have to report
to you for everything

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:03.840
just because you think your
life revolves around me.

01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:06.732
- Where were you?

01:00:06.732 --> 01:00:08.780
Liz, stop lying to me.

01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:10.590
- I was getting dressed

01:00:10.590 --> 01:00:13.010
and I was trying to look my best for you

01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:13.843
and I took too long.

01:00:13.843 --> 01:00:14.676
There.

01:00:17.230 --> 01:00:19.020
- I'm sure they've given our
table away by now anyway--

01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:19.853
- Really, Will?

01:00:19.853 --> 01:00:20.686
On a Tuesday night?

01:00:20.686 --> 01:00:21.519
- Yeah!

01:00:22.372 --> 01:00:23.205
Yeah, how would you know?

01:00:23.205 --> 01:00:24.055
- I work at a bar.

01:00:24.055 --> 01:00:24.888
- Yeah?

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:30.970
Been hanging out with your friend Tony

01:00:30.970 --> 01:00:31.880
a lot there lately too?

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:33.180
- God, what is up with you?

01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:34.100
I'm sorry I'm late.

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:35.750
I'm here now, let's go to dinner.

01:00:39.450 --> 01:00:40.283
- Fine.

01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:42.990
Let's go.

01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:43.823
Great.

01:01:16.310 --> 01:01:19.160
Hey, I was thinking of going
to this galley opening tonight

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:20.420
in downtown.

01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:22.380
Would you like to come with?

01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:23.480
I'll buy you dinner.

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:24.447
7:00 p.m.?

01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:28.490
- Hey, no, sorry, I
have too much to do tonight.

01:01:31.770 --> 01:01:33.360
- What's happening?

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:34.510
How about Friday night?

01:01:35.921 --> 01:01:38.323
- No, Will, back off!

01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:55.200
No, I work.

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.300
Maybe another time.

01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:14.393
Hey.

01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:24.973
- Hey.

01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:28.900
- Thanks for meeting up with me.

01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:36.333
It's warm today for a change.

01:05:38.070 --> 01:05:38.963
- Global warming.

01:05:41.321 --> 01:05:44.780
- Yeah.

01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:45.613
- Yeah.

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:50.743
- I'm moving on.

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:53.930
I'm thinking of going back to Oregon.

01:05:59.270 --> 01:06:00.920
I don't think LA is right for me.

01:06:02.070 --> 01:06:03.210
Maybe it's not the right time.

01:06:03.210 --> 01:06:04.160
I don't know.

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:06.313
I hate bartending.

01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:12.510
I don't know what the hell
I'm doing at all, Will.

01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:16.093
I just--

01:06:16.093 --> 01:06:17.010
- You're going home?

01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:19.363
To Eugene?

01:06:20.330 --> 01:06:21.633
- No, I don't think so.

01:06:23.890 --> 01:06:24.943
Might go to Portland.

01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:29.063
- Yeah.

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:31.633
Okay.

01:06:34.070 --> 01:06:35.560
- But we'll totally see each other around.

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:37.760
I'll definitely come
back to visit for sure.

01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:41.373
- We will.

01:06:45.970 --> 01:06:47.670
- It was good fun while it lasted.

01:06:49.330 --> 01:06:50.250
But you know me.

01:06:50.250 --> 01:06:51.930
I don't like tying myself down.

01:06:51.930 --> 01:06:53.900
Always on the go.

01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:55.413
Always impulsive.

01:07:01.370 --> 01:07:02.920
You're a really cool guy, Will.

01:07:05.890 --> 01:07:07.340
I'm really going to miss you.

01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:11.170
- You too, Liz.

01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:56.310
- Hey, Will!

01:10:56.310 --> 01:10:57.910
I'm back in town.

01:10:57.910 --> 01:10:59.430
I met up with a few agriculturalists

01:10:59.430 --> 01:11:01.543
who are gonna start a
farm here in Topanga.

01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:04.373
I've missed you.

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:07.600
We should hang out sometime.

01:11:22.590 --> 01:11:23.623
Come on, play it.

01:11:25.090 --> 01:11:26.430
- Can't believe
you're making me do this.

01:11:26.430 --> 01:11:28.017
- I'm not gonna judge.

01:11:28.017 --> 01:11:29.390
- Alright.

01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:30.763
I only have two chords,

01:11:31.630 --> 01:11:33.440
because I can't find the third one yet.

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:35.590
So I'll play you what I got.

01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:36.423
- Perfect.

01:11:36.423 --> 01:11:37.890
- Alright.

01:11:37.890 --> 01:11:39.990
I always thought I had a little.

01:11:41.330 --> 01:11:42.908
