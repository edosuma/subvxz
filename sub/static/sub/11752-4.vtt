'Dear Maurice, we regret to inform you

00:27.800 --> 00:31.109
'that we have decided to terminate
your contract on Grubbs.

00:31.160 --> 00:34.550
'After careful deliberation,
numerous second chances

00:34.600 --> 00:36.390
'and multiple missed deadlines,

00:36.440 --> 00:39.350
'we feel cessation of
our working relationship

00:39.399 --> 00:41.829
'is best for all concerned.

00:41.880 --> 00:44.469
'We wish you the best
of luck for the future.

00:44.520 --> 00:46.829
'Yours sincerely, Carol...

00:46.880 --> 00:50.880
'And Carroll.'

00:58.520 --> 01:01.789
Excuse me... is this the psychiatry wing?

01:01.840 --> 01:04.429
Yes, yes, it is, yes. How can I help?

01:04.479 --> 01:08.479
Um... I'm... having some trouble

01:09.240 --> 01:13.239
with, er... I think... maybe...

01:13.719 --> 01:16.319
It's OK. Well done for coming in.

01:17.799 --> 01:19.670
- Come on.
- Oh, thank you.

01:19.719 --> 01:23.349
Yeah... um...

01:23.400 --> 01:25.590
So, well, I...

01:25.640 --> 01:29.640
I think I just need some help.

01:29.760 --> 01:32.230
Well, you've come to the right place,

01:32.280 --> 01:34.710
but unfortunately, I'm not a doctor.

01:34.760 --> 01:36.349
Oh. Sorry.

01:36.400 --> 01:40.400
No. I just dress like
a doctor, cos I'm mad.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.189
Right. Um...

01:43.240 --> 01:44.789
Is there any doctors here?

01:44.840 --> 01:48.229
Yeah, there's doctors everywhere.

01:48.280 --> 01:49.390
It's a hospital.

01:49.439 --> 01:51.870
Yeah, of course, yeah.

01:51.920 --> 01:53.629
Thank you.

02:03.759 --> 02:07.759
- Tea.
- Thanks.

02:09.120 --> 02:13.120
Just going to ask, um... if
I could borrow that jacket

02:14.519 --> 02:16.310
that you used to wear?

02:16.359 --> 02:19.310
The one that you said was a big mistake.

02:19.360 --> 02:23.360
Sure.

02:23.879 --> 02:27.879
- You all right.
- Fine. Just resting.

02:29.800 --> 02:32.949
You look... quite bad.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
I think it just might be
that it's quite dark in here.

02:38.599 --> 02:42.599
You told Mum yet?

02:43.400 --> 02:46.670
Do you think that maybe you
should just... go to the doctor

02:46.719 --> 02:49.110
or something?

02:49.159 --> 02:53.159
Uh... no, I think I just need
to sit down for a bit more.

02:57.280 --> 03:01.280
Don't worry about me.

03:02.840 --> 03:06.840
OK.

03:16.240 --> 03:17.909
So, we finished our brunch,

03:17.960 --> 03:21.949
then we just started going
for it in the back of a car,

03:22.000 --> 03:23.909
and it was so passionate.

03:23.960 --> 03:25.949
It was like we'd gone
back in a time machine.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.740
Hugo? Can you get ready, now, please?

03:30.599 --> 03:32.710
So, anyway, now Steve is back at home

03:32.759 --> 03:34.949
and Hugo is really happy.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.069
Just watching you all support each other

03:37.120 --> 03:40.590
after all the terrible things
that you've had to deal with,

03:40.639 --> 03:43.590
it really helped put everything
into perspective for us.

03:43.639 --> 03:46.509
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I just... slept badly.

03:46.560 --> 03:50.560
So, well, that's why we wanted to
take you out to dinner, basically...

03:51.280 --> 03:55.280
To say thank you for being
such an inspiration to us.

03:56.920 --> 03:58.949
It only lasted about
two-and-a-half minutes

03:59.000 --> 04:01.069
and I'm pretty sure she
didn't achieve climax.

04:01.120 --> 04:02.909
I don't need to know
the details, thank you.

04:02.960 --> 04:04.909
Just because I'm in love with your wife,

04:04.960 --> 04:07.789
it doesn't mean I can leap into
your bed with her on a Friday night.

04:07.840 --> 04:11.840
Please... anything I can do to make
it up to you, just let me know.

04:12.280 --> 04:14.270
I could build you a bigger,
better writing shed.

04:14.319 --> 04:15.629
That won't be necessary.

04:15.680 --> 04:16.789
All right, then.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.149
Punch me.

04:18.199 --> 04:19.909
It's only fair. Go on.

04:19.959 --> 04:23.960
Punch me in the face, as many times
as you like, as hard as you can.

04:24.159 --> 04:25.589
Please... just once.

04:25.639 --> 04:28.709
Covered in Satan's piss!

04:28.759 --> 04:32.759
Look, I... I really, really
want to make it up to you.

04:33.079 --> 04:37.079
Maurice, I'm begging you.

04:38.879 --> 04:41.509
Morning! Have you seen Barry anywhere?

04:41.560 --> 04:43.350
He's in the cabin with your husband.

04:43.399 --> 04:45.990
Said he needed to have a chat
with him about something.

04:46.040 --> 04:47.470
Oh. What about?

04:47.519 --> 04:50.430
Oh, he said that he'd done something
awful and that he deserved to die.

04:50.480 --> 04:52.709
Oh! Sounds very melodramatic.

04:52.759 --> 04:55.509
I'm sorry, Deborah. I
couldn't keep it a secret.

04:55.560 --> 04:57.430
I had to tell him the whole truth.

04:57.480 --> 04:59.389
I refuse to take payment for a year.

04:59.439 --> 05:02.069
I think you should just hit me
over the head with that shovel.

05:02.120 --> 05:04.269
Ryan, give her the shovel.

05:04.319 --> 05:05.790
- Blabbermouth.
- What's happened?

05:05.840 --> 05:08.509
We committed the act of heavenly darkness.

05:08.560 --> 05:10.949
We lay in sin.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.910
Um... OK.

05:16.680 --> 05:19.790
Dad?

05:19.839 --> 05:23.839
Dad!

05:38.600 --> 05:42.600
Oi! Joan of Arc...

05:43.480 --> 05:46.709
What the hell?

05:46.759 --> 05:49.750
- Did Dad lend you that jacket?
- Mm-hm.

05:49.800 --> 05:53.470
Unfair!

05:56.079 --> 05:58.430
There's something wrong with Dad.

05:58.480 --> 06:02.480
I think he's got cancer.

06:06.560 --> 06:07.870
Hi, Maurice.

06:07.920 --> 06:11.149
This fucking hat...

06:11.199 --> 06:14.029
Ludicrous.

06:14.079 --> 06:16.990
Did you perhaps have a chat
with Barry this morning?

06:17.040 --> 06:18.589
Maybe we should talk about that,

06:18.639 --> 06:20.829
instead of playing with
your father's magic stuff.

06:20.879 --> 06:22.949
Can't you see that I've
got more important things

06:23.000 --> 06:24.550
on my mind right now?

06:24.600 --> 06:26.230
Like what?

06:26.279 --> 06:30.269
Like the fact that the Carrolls have
just dropped Grubbs, for instance.

06:30.319 --> 06:34.319
And there's all this
stupid crap to sort through.

06:36.160 --> 06:39.550
I hate magic. I hate it.

06:39.600 --> 06:43.430
Well, Barbara has invited us out
for dinner, to say thank you,

06:43.480 --> 06:45.069
for being an inspiration to them,

06:45.120 --> 06:48.230
so... well, we've got that
to look forward to, at least.

06:48.279 --> 06:49.670
Well, I don't want to go.

06:49.720 --> 06:51.069
Great.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.110
Well, I've told them that
we are, so you have to.

06:53.159 --> 06:57.159
That's very democratic, isn't it?

07:04.159 --> 07:08.159
How are my two lovely children?

07:08.240 --> 07:12.149
What are you both up to?

07:12.199 --> 07:14.069
Oh, you've got make-up on.

07:14.120 --> 07:18.120
Oh, it's very nice.

07:20.959 --> 07:24.110
Excuse me. Mr Flowers.

07:24.160 --> 07:25.430
Fuck off, Shun.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.310
I have idea, Mr Flowers.

07:27.360 --> 07:29.629
Very big shame Grubbs is cancel,

07:29.680 --> 07:32.910
but Carol and Carroll very
positive, some of my projects.

07:32.959 --> 07:36.829
Please... this is very
simple traditional comic.

07:36.879 --> 07:40.879
I think definitely success.

07:41.240 --> 07:45.240
So, I've just spoken to your
father, and we've got some bad news.

07:46.040 --> 07:49.230
- They've dropped Grubbs. - What?
- Is that why he's being so weird?

07:49.279 --> 07:51.829
Probably. I can't think
what else it would be?

07:51.879 --> 07:53.709
- Have you asked him?
- Hm?

07:53.759 --> 07:56.870
Have you asked him if
anything else is going on?

07:56.920 --> 08:00.430
Course I have. Why? Has
he said something to you?

08:00.480 --> 08:02.629
So he has? Great secret-keeping.

08:02.680 --> 08:04.509
Amy, what's he said?

08:04.560 --> 08:06.750
Amy, we have to talk about
this. It's very important.

08:06.800 --> 08:10.800
- Where are you going?
- It doesn't matter.

08:10.959 --> 08:13.430
♪ Dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee... ♪

08:13.480 --> 08:16.589
Super Flowers! Protect world
from dangerous monster!

08:16.639 --> 08:18.709
You write story, I draw picture.

08:18.759 --> 08:19.870
Is this a joke?

08:19.920 --> 08:21.269
We are team, Mr Flowers.

08:21.319 --> 08:22.430
No. We're not a team, Shun.

08:22.480 --> 08:24.509
You're just a person we
hire to do the pictures.

08:24.560 --> 08:28.509
No wonder I haven't been able to focus, when
you're constantly farting about on other things,

08:28.560 --> 08:30.189
most of which is basically porn.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.549
- It's unbelievably distracting.
- You unbelievably...

08:32.600 --> 08:35.350
Then I discover you're buttering
up the Carrolls behind my back

08:35.399 --> 08:38.549
with these ridiculous
cartoons of me and my family.

08:38.600 --> 08:41.149
I gave you a job. I've given
you a house, for heaven's sake.

08:41.200 --> 08:44.909
Not house, Mr Flowers... tiny office,
very uncomfortable for sleeping.

08:44.960 --> 08:47.110
You are always snore very
loud, like big dinosaur.

08:47.159 --> 08:49.350
Well, why don't you draw a
picture of me as a dinosaur,

08:49.399 --> 08:51.509
with a ten-foot penis and
some breasts on my head?

08:51.559 --> 08:53.509
Why you not tell truth, Mr Flowers?

08:53.559 --> 08:54.559
You are stupid idiot,

08:54.600 --> 08:56.629
everything complete muddle, all you fault.

08:56.679 --> 09:00.590
I've been trying, Shun.
It's just not very easy.

09:00.639 --> 09:04.639
You are not easy.

09:58.679 --> 10:02.679
Arrrggghhh!

10:03.399 --> 10:07.309
(Donald?)

10:07.360 --> 10:11.110
What's matter, Donald?

10:11.159 --> 10:14.070
Donald, what's matter?

10:14.120 --> 10:17.870
The cogs of my heart are all asunder.

10:17.919 --> 10:21.919
Cogs of my heart all asunder...

10:22.440 --> 10:25.750
Cogs of my...

10:25.799 --> 10:27.070
Girl trouble?

10:27.120 --> 10:29.750
Yeah.

10:29.799 --> 10:31.200
Donald...

10:33.200 --> 10:37.200
Donald, I have a very good
advice for you, Donald.

10:38.519 --> 10:42.519
Will make girl very happy.

10:43.600 --> 10:47.600
Just give little tickle...
Little, tiny tickle all over,

10:49.159 --> 10:53.159
make girl very happy, Donald.

10:54.159 --> 10:56.230
That's the weirdest
advice I've ever heard.

10:56.279 --> 10:58.029
What's wrong with you?

10:58.080 --> 11:02.080
You've not even got a book to work
on, now... why don't you just leave?

11:02.360 --> 11:04.509
I have plan, Donald.
Everything will be happy.

11:04.559 --> 11:05.830
No-one likes you.

11:05.879 --> 11:07.029
We are friends, Donald.

11:07.080 --> 11:09.429
We're not friends.

11:16.120 --> 11:19.110
- Maurice!
- I'm getting ready.

11:19.159 --> 11:23.159
Why is Shun in the fucking car?

11:24.080 --> 11:26.789
- Get out, Shun.
- Good evening, Mrs Flowers. I will drive.

11:26.840 --> 11:27.909
No, thank you, get out.

11:27.960 --> 11:30.830
You must have a relax this
evening, have a drink, Mrs Flowers.

11:30.879 --> 11:32.230
- Get out!
- I will...

11:32.279 --> 11:34.429
OK, one second, for the seatbelt.

11:34.480 --> 11:36.230
Oh, my gosh...!

11:36.279 --> 11:39.230
Let go of the seatbelt!

11:39.279 --> 11:42.429
Mrs Flowers, if you can have a
conversation with your husband,

11:42.480 --> 11:43.710
I think will be very big help.

11:43.759 --> 11:45.990
Maybe have a little snifter, good mood...

11:46.039 --> 11:47.190
Oh, it's my fault, is it?

11:47.240 --> 11:48.909
I think if you are welcome him,

11:48.960 --> 11:50.789
maybe conversation will be more simple.

11:50.840 --> 11:53.950
Sometimes, maybe your manner is
little bit terrify Mr Flowers...

11:54.000 --> 11:56.669
Oh, you've got some
nerve, mister, some nerve.

11:56.720 --> 11:59.149
- Something need to happen.
- I tell you what needs to happen...

11:59.200 --> 12:01.029
You need to butt the hell out.

12:01.080 --> 12:02.710
Very confused, Mrs Flowers.

12:02.759 --> 12:06.759
So am I, Shun. So am I.

12:09.360 --> 12:11.590
Can I get you anything to drink?

12:11.639 --> 12:15.639
Uh... oh, I'll just have a
pina colada or something.

12:16.639 --> 12:19.509
- Pina colada?
- Yeah, no. Um...

12:19.559 --> 12:20.990
Can I just have a burger, then?

12:21.039 --> 12:23.590
I'll have a pina colada.

12:23.639 --> 12:27.470
Oh, yeah. Me too, then.

12:27.519 --> 12:30.990
- And a burger. - Yeah, and a
burger. And loads of condiments.

12:31.039 --> 12:35.039
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

12:44.039 --> 12:46.269
Maurice?

12:46.320 --> 12:47.950
Sorry, we're a little bit late.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.950
I just thought I'd come and say hello.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.230
Hello.

12:51.279 --> 12:52.830
Steve, Hugo's dad.

12:52.879 --> 12:55.950
- Oh. - Sorry. - Right.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.389
- Oh... couldn't pinch one
of them, could I? - Sure.

12:59.440 --> 13:01.230
Cheers, nice one.

13:01.279 --> 13:04.950
Yeah.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.590
It's nice to meet you, finally.
I've heard so much about you,

13:07.639 --> 13:10.509
through Barbara... and Hugo.

13:10.559 --> 13:12.669
He thinks you're great.

13:12.720 --> 13:13.909
Yeah, he...

13:13.960 --> 13:15.870
Well, he loves Grubbs.

13:15.919 --> 13:19.149
I used to read it to him
before bed, sometimes. I...

13:19.200 --> 13:22.029
In a weird kind of a way, I kind
of feel like I know you already.

13:22.080 --> 13:25.750
Hm.

13:25.799 --> 13:27.389
You don't.

13:27.440 --> 13:30.029
- No.
- You don't know me.

13:30.080 --> 13:32.110
Yeah. No.

13:34.840 --> 13:36.190
What?

13:36.240 --> 13:40.240
No, nothing, just...

13:44.440 --> 13:48.250
Yeah. Thank you. Very nice. Thank you.

14:16.919 --> 14:18.590
You're hungry.

14:23.879 --> 14:27.879
So, who's Penny, anyway?

14:28.279 --> 14:31.509
That thing that you
wrote, Penny's Passage,

14:31.559 --> 14:34.190
is that an ex or something?

14:34.240 --> 14:38.240
Mm... No. Penny died in
the early sixth century.

14:39.960 --> 14:43.070
- You not heard of her?
- No.

14:43.120 --> 14:47.120
No, I haven't.

14:49.240 --> 14:53.190
So, there was this pagan
ceremony called The Passage,

14:53.240 --> 14:56.669
where if you wanted to marry a
man from the neighbouring village,

14:56.720 --> 14:58.029
they'd cut your hand,

14:58.080 --> 15:01.110
so you could mingle your blood
with the earth of your home.

15:01.159 --> 15:02.870
And then they'd gift you a horse

15:02.919 --> 15:05.669
and you'd ride it over this sacred bridge

15:05.720 --> 15:08.830
and across the holy
lake out of the forest.

15:08.879 --> 15:11.710
And that was how they sent
you on to your new life.

15:11.759 --> 15:15.350
And you were allowed to have sex
and have children and everything.

15:15.399 --> 15:17.750
- I think I ran over that bridge!
- Yeah!

15:17.799 --> 15:21.429
So, because Penelope had
Asperger's or something,

15:21.480 --> 15:24.350
- she wasn't allowed to
do The Passage. - Shit!

15:24.399 --> 15:27.269
Even though she was in love
with this blind boy called Barney

15:27.320 --> 15:30.710
- from a village about four
miles away. - Barney? - Yeah.

15:30.759 --> 15:34.759
So anyway, this one night,
there was a giant storm.

15:35.600 --> 15:39.110
And Penny sneaked out to this pen
where they kept these horses.

15:39.159 --> 15:42.309
And basically, the horses
were a bit freaked out by her

15:42.360 --> 15:44.230
but there was this one horse,

15:44.279 --> 15:46.789
it just seemed to quite like Penny.

15:46.840 --> 15:48.629
So she sneaked it out of the pen,

15:48.679 --> 15:52.230
and started riding it around
the forest through the rain.

15:52.279 --> 15:54.549
Like, basically doing The Passage.

15:54.600 --> 15:58.600
She got so excited, she let out
this strange biblical howl.

16:00.080 --> 16:03.029
Which was stupid, because
the whole tribe heard it,

16:03.080 --> 16:05.429
and saw her belting it through the forest,

16:05.480 --> 16:08.149
and were like, "She is not allowed
on that horse, get her back!"

16:08.200 --> 16:11.509
But she just kept going and going
and she was faster than them.

16:11.559 --> 16:15.559
So she galloped over the
sacred bridge, across the lake,

16:15.960 --> 16:19.960
and did the four miles through the
mud all the way to Barney's hut.

16:20.320 --> 16:22.350
And then they made love...

16:22.399 --> 16:24.269
in the storm.

16:24.320 --> 16:27.990
And it was amazing.

16:28.039 --> 16:29.950
And then what happened?

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
And then... they hanged
her. For being a witch.

16:34.799 --> 16:38.799
But at least she fucking did it, you know?

16:59.399 --> 17:02.230
Hey!

17:02.279 --> 17:03.950
What are you doing?!

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
And having that time apart
has really opened our minds.

17:08.759 --> 17:11.549
And we're even thinking... I can't
believe I'm telling you this,

17:11.598 --> 17:15.598
but we're even thinking of trying
a sort of more open relationship.

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
- Oh, yes? - Yeah, well, we both
have people that we want to, um...

17:20.358 --> 17:24.358
well, to be frank, have sex
with. Apart from each other.

17:24.920 --> 17:28.069
And since Steve's already spent
a few nights with Miss Collins...

17:28.118 --> 17:31.920
She's stunning, by the way,
used to be a high-jumper.

17:32.559 --> 17:34.349
.. I thought it would be fair for me

17:34.400 --> 17:37.150
to have an equivalent experience
with someone I like the look of.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.630
Sounds very healthy.

17:38.680 --> 17:41.190
Don't worry, we're not about
to start propositioning you,

17:41.240 --> 17:44.150
- that's not what this is about.
- Hm. Great.

17:44.200 --> 17:46.630
- Only thing is, we do
have a rule. - Yeah.

17:46.680 --> 17:50.269
Which is, we are not allowed
to fall in love with anyone.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.190
How can you have a rule
not to fall in love?

17:52.240 --> 17:55.150
- It's not a choice. - It's funny,
we've been doing it for a while now,

17:55.200 --> 17:58.910
- haven't we, Maurice? - Have you? Gosh,
that makes me feel so much better.

17:58.960 --> 18:01.509
You see? I told you it's not
weird... everyone's doing it.

18:01.559 --> 18:03.309
In fact I slept with someone last night

18:03.359 --> 18:06.990
and we haven't even talked
about it yet, have we?

18:07.039 --> 18:08.710
You all right there, Maurice?

18:08.759 --> 18:11.500
Bit spicy for you? The food, I mean?

18:12.279 --> 18:14.230
Who with, then? Go on.

18:14.279 --> 18:17.150
- Barry.
- R-r-really?

18:17.200 --> 18:21.200
Mm. Yes. He was very
sensitive. And very hairy.

18:25.119 --> 18:28.430
What about you, then, Maurice?

18:28.480 --> 18:31.509
I'll give you a clue. Um...

18:31.559 --> 18:32.789
Sushi.

18:32.839 --> 18:36.269
- Have you lost your mind?
- No! The Japanese guy?

18:36.319 --> 18:38.309
Not just an illustrator, is he, Maurice?

18:38.359 --> 18:40.349
I think it's great, Maurice.

18:40.400 --> 18:41.789
Here's to a bit of sideways.

18:41.839 --> 18:44.869
A bit of sideways!

18:44.920 --> 18:47.430
This is insane. Everything
about this is insane.

18:47.480 --> 18:48.990
We're surrounded by naked people

18:49.039 --> 18:50.950
having dinner with complete strangers.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.750
This spoon is the weirdest spoon
I've ever seen in my life,

18:53.799 --> 18:55.829
and this lamb, it's not
even lamb, it's beef.

18:55.880 --> 18:58.109
I think they just got the order wrong.

18:58.160 --> 19:00.430
OK, let's just have a time-out.

19:00.480 --> 19:04.480
Maybe we'll just get a few side
dishes and just chill for a bit.

19:04.799 --> 19:07.150
Yeah, that's a great
idea, isn't it, Steve(?)

19:07.200 --> 19:10.430
- These peas are lovely.
- Mm, great.

19:10.480 --> 19:13.390
Mmm. Nice, innit?

19:13.440 --> 19:14.910
Delicious.

19:17.839 --> 19:21.509
Oh, yeah, delicious, isn't it(?)
More wine, please, waiter.

19:21.559 --> 19:23.509
Don't get too close, though.

19:23.559 --> 19:25.869
I might suddenly fuck
you in front of my wife

19:25.920 --> 19:28.390
because that's our arrangement.

19:41.119 --> 19:44.069
So this is how you treat me now?
After everything I've done for you,

19:44.119 --> 19:46.069
you deliberately try and hurt my feelings?

19:46.119 --> 19:47.509
Well, it's not very hard, is it?

19:47.559 --> 19:51.559
I have a very strong emotional
constitution, thank you very much.

19:51.680 --> 19:55.109
Your eyebrows are stupid.

19:55.160 --> 19:57.109
How dare you?!

19:57.160 --> 20:00.990
I've been swimming in that pool all
day waiting for you to come back.

20:01.039 --> 20:04.869
- Now, pack your bags!
We're leaving town. - Why?

20:04.920 --> 20:08.829
- Because you're out of control.
- I just went for a drink. - No.

20:08.880 --> 20:12.869
I smell sex like a shark smells blood.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.630
And you REEK of it!

20:14.680 --> 20:17.309
It doesn't matter how silly
you think the costumes are...

20:17.359 --> 20:19.789
- That place was ludicrous.
- .. you don't walk out on me...

20:19.839 --> 20:22.549
- It was like a brothel that served food.
- .. in front of our friends.

20:22.599 --> 20:24.309
They're not friends. I won't sit there

20:24.359 --> 20:26.950
- while you randomly accuse me of being gay...
- Are you gay or not?

20:27.000 --> 20:29.309
.. excusing the fact you
committed brazen adultery

20:29.359 --> 20:32.069
right under my nose and you
don't seem to feel any guilt.

20:32.119 --> 20:34.309
What do you mean?! You
haven't even asked me.

20:34.359 --> 20:36.910
- You're a thieving Sapphic demon!
- No, no, no.

20:36.960 --> 20:39.509
- .. all the way back from town!
- No, Donald, no.

20:39.559 --> 20:43.559
Either this succubus is sabotaging
me or she is a Sideways Sally.

20:45.400 --> 20:46.990
- Oh, yeah.
- Donald, be quiet.

20:47.039 --> 20:48.789
And she's blatantly in love with Abigail

20:48.839 --> 20:51.430
because she's trying to steal
her from me and I caught them

20:51.480 --> 20:54.390
canoodling in the forest like
a pair of heartless lesbians.

20:54.440 --> 20:56.910
And here's the proof!

20:56.960 --> 21:01.710
- Donald! - Don't you dare! - The
proof is in the pudding, sister!

21:01.759 --> 21:04.710
- You want a piece? You want
a piece?! - OK! - Get up!

21:04.759 --> 21:06.509
Get off me!

21:06.559 --> 21:10.029
- Stop it! - Aaaargh! - Whoa! Whoa!

21:10.079 --> 21:12.349
Well, guess what, I love her too.

21:12.400 --> 21:15.750
And you can't always get everything
you want just because you're insane!

21:15.799 --> 21:18.509
Look, let's all just calm down here.

21:18.559 --> 21:22.559
Whatever Amy is experiencing,
that's her gift to share with us

21:22.880 --> 21:25.349
- when she's ready.
- Dad, what are you talking about?

21:25.400 --> 21:27.990
- I already told you.
- Yeah.

21:28.039 --> 21:31.910
- But I thought it was a secret.
- Well, it's not now, is it? - No.

21:31.960 --> 21:35.960
So... Well, well done.
Really well done, very brave.

21:36.559 --> 21:40.230
- Don't clap it! Jesus. - Sorry.
- Did everybody know apart from me?

21:40.279 --> 21:42.309
Mum...

21:42.359 --> 21:44.910
Why didn't you tell me?

21:44.960 --> 21:46.069
Because.

21:46.119 --> 21:48.789
- Because what? Why didn't you tell me?
- I don't know.

21:48.839 --> 21:50.269
Why did you tell him before me?

21:50.319 --> 21:52.109
Don't take it personally, Deborah,

21:52.160 --> 21:54.470
these things need to come
out organically sometimes.

21:54.519 --> 21:56.390
Maybe she didn't have an opportunity yet.

21:56.440 --> 21:58.470
Well, thank you for the
insight, Mr Perfect Dad.

21:58.519 --> 22:00.230
Why are you suddenly so knowledgeable?!

22:00.279 --> 22:02.269
- Because I can relate to her.
- And why is that?

22:02.319 --> 22:03.950
Is that because you're gay as well?!

22:04.000 --> 22:07.549
- It's Shun, isn't it? He's
your geisha, isn't he? - Yeah.

22:07.599 --> 22:10.549
Yes, he is, yeah. He's my
concubine, that's right.

22:10.599 --> 22:12.269
- Yeah.
- He's my illustrator!

22:12.319 --> 22:15.349
AKA, he illustrates your
dick. How about that?

22:15.400 --> 22:18.240
- This is getting stupid now.
- What do you mean, you can relate to her?

22:18.279 --> 22:20.750
Because I find you very
difficult to talk to sometimes.

22:20.799 --> 22:24.269
- You just mumble and wander off...
- I find you very difficult to talk to sometimes.

22:24.319 --> 22:27.829
- So, would you fuck me if I
dressed as a samurai? - I'm not gay!

22:27.880 --> 22:29.150
Amy's gay.

22:29.200 --> 22:31.630
I know Amy's gay and I'm very
happy for her for being gay

22:31.680 --> 22:33.150
but I'm not married to Amy, am I?

22:33.200 --> 22:37.200
I don't know what the hell you think
you're doing, but it's not helping.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.990
Could you all just leave me
alone for five minutes, please?

22:43.039 --> 22:44.230
Did something go wrong...?

22:44.279 --> 22:46.269
Oh, fuck off, fucking children!

22:46.319 --> 22:50.319
Fuck off! Fuck's sake!

22:58.240 --> 23:02.240
Whoo! Flower's family very angry with me.

23:03.079 --> 23:06.390
Never mind. Challenge for Grubbs.

23:06.440 --> 23:10.440
We must think idea for new adventure.

23:11.240 --> 23:13.710
Make better for Mr Flowers.

23:13.759 --> 23:16.069
You know English Bible.

23:16.119 --> 23:18.630
If somebody punch you in the face,

23:18.680 --> 23:21.829
turn you other face. Just
punch you face again.

23:21.880 --> 23:25.430
Jesus-san! He is teaching this, very wise.

23:26.880 --> 23:30.880
Yes. You know, Grubbs, you
probably understand how I feeling.

23:31.519 --> 23:33.670
Carol and the Caroll not like you.

23:33.720 --> 23:36.630
Flowers not like me. Doesn't matter.

23:36.680 --> 23:40.680
Challenge! Let's go! Faster!

23:41.839 --> 23:45.839
I'm so happy!
