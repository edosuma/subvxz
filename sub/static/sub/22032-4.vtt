00:12.758 --> 00:15.425
(Panting)

00:21.350 --> 00:24.017
Great. Nothing.

00:26.105 --> 00:28.155
(Grunting)

00:32.661 --> 00:35.579
(laughs)

00:35.614 --> 00:37.280
What the hell is that?

00:37.282 --> 00:39.533
(Coughs)

00:39.585 --> 00:41.752
Ben? Ben!

00:41.787 --> 00:43.670
Christ, what day is it?

00:43.705 --> 00:45.789
<i>It's Monday.</i>

00:46.191 --> 00:47.690
Wait, how long have you been out here for?

00:47.692 --> 00:50.610
I don't know. Two, three days maybe.

00:50.662 --> 00:52.579
I thought you checked the
dead drop at week's end.

00:52.614 --> 00:53.997
No, no, I check it when I can.

00:54.032 --> 00:55.748
Do you want to tell me what
the hell you're doing here?

00:55.784 --> 00:59.669
-<i> Why is Caleb not here?</i>
- Sorry, he's on assignment in New Jersey.

00:59.704 --> 01:02.622
And this can't wait. I need you to go
get Anna and bring her back here.

01:02.674 --> 01:04.706
- I need to brief you both.
- Both? No, no.

01:04.709 --> 01:07.760
You tell me what you have and I
pass that along. This place isn't safe.

01:07.796 --> 01:11.130
Well, if it were that simple,
I'd have written a letter.

01:11.183 --> 01:15.635
This has to be in person.
Besides, I come bearing gifts.

01:15.687 --> 01:19.022
-<i> (Music playing)</i>
- (drunken singing, laughing)

01:38.243 --> 01:41.377
Look, I know, the codebook,
the egg, they're not safe.

01:41.413 --> 01:44.547
But this, this is.

01:54.893 --> 01:57.260
That's brilliant there, Ben.

01:57.262 --> 02:00.680
Look, this clear fluid is called the agent.

02:00.732 --> 02:03.266
And the green is the reagent.

02:03.318 --> 02:06.236
Now you apply just a little
bit with a very fine brush.

02:06.271 --> 02:08.905
It took us months to acquire this much.

02:10.609 --> 02:12.242
There.

02:12.277 --> 02:14.077
Just wait.

02:14.112 --> 02:16.029
<i>(Door opens)</i>

02:16.081 --> 02:18.081
Anna: <i> Abe?</i>

02:20.835 --> 02:23.286
Ahem. Yeah.

02:26.207 --> 02:28.591
<i>I came as soon we closed.</i>

02:28.627 --> 02:30.593
What have you done to your root cellar?

02:30.629 --> 02:32.545
- (Growls)
- (shrieks)

02:32.597 --> 02:35.298
- (laughing)
- Oh!

02:35.300 --> 02:38.768
- Anna Strong.
- Abe: <i> Oh, come on.</i> <i>He's filthy.</i>

02:38.803 --> 02:40.553
I thought you had forgotten about us.

02:40.605 --> 02:41.888
Who, me? No, I've been down here for months.

02:41.940 --> 02:44.607
- (laughs)
- Good to see you.

02:46.311 --> 02:50.029
This is a gift for Abigail.

02:50.065 --> 02:51.898
It's made to look like her son carved it.

02:51.950 --> 02:56.235
But when she handles
it, she will discover...

02:56.288 --> 02:57.537
this.

02:57.572 --> 02:59.205
What is it?

02:59.240 --> 03:02.158
It's instructions on how to
compose her intelligence reports.

03:02.210 --> 03:05.161
<i>Washington requires proper
protocol and context.</i>

03:05.213 --> 03:07.413
No. No.

03:07.465 --> 03:09.165
No, Abigail had an arrangement with me.

03:09.217 --> 03:10.883
She never volunteered to spy for Washington.

03:10.919 --> 03:12.669
Anna, she is vital to us.

03:12.671 --> 03:14.721
Right now, she's our only
window into Philadelphia.

03:14.756 --> 03:16.723
She'll be terrified. She won't do it.

03:16.758 --> 03:18.975
She sent us the information
about General Lee.

03:19.010 --> 03:22.145
Let her make the choice. I
believe she'll make the right one.

03:26.601 --> 03:28.067
I don't know how I'd get it to her.

03:28.103 --> 03:29.686
Abe: <i>What about Major Hewlett?</i>

03:29.738 --> 03:31.404
He's already offered you his friendship.

03:31.439 --> 03:35.858
I'm sure he'd send it by
special courier for you.

03:35.910 --> 03:37.110
Ah, look.

03:37.162 --> 03:40.196
What did I tell you, huh? (laughs)

03:40.198 --> 03:42.248
Invisible ink.

03:44.369 --> 03:45.702
Magic.

03:45.704 --> 03:47.286
No, chemistry.

03:47.339 --> 03:48.838
I'll show you how to apply it as well.

03:48.873 --> 03:51.124
While Abe remains in the city,
you'll have to transcribe

03:51.176 --> 03:53.710
his letters and Abigail's and
put them both into the drop.

03:53.762 --> 03:55.345
While Abe remains in the city?

03:55.380 --> 03:57.096
I was just about to tell
him that I can't do it.

03:57.132 --> 04:00.350
- Ben, I can't do it.
- What? Why?

04:00.385 --> 04:02.135
Abe, you're studying the
law. It's the perfect cover.

04:02.187 --> 04:04.554
If it were that simple,
I'd be there already.

04:04.556 --> 04:07.607
All right? As it is, I can't stay
for longer than a week, so...

04:10.779 --> 04:13.696
Look, whatever's happening between
you two, it has to be put aside.

04:13.732 --> 04:15.898
Both: It's not that.

04:17.569 --> 04:20.403
- I can't help you unless you tell me the truth.
- (sighs)

04:24.959 --> 04:27.710
The truth is... ahem.

04:29.831 --> 04:31.581
(Sighs)

04:33.251 --> 04:34.751
I have a better solution.

04:34.803 --> 04:39.422
Now what we really need is
a friend inside the city.

04:41.226 --> 04:42.842
And I may have found him.

04:42.894 --> 04:44.977
<i>Ah, a friend? Who?</i>

04:45.013 --> 04:46.729
His name's Townsend.

04:46.765 --> 04:48.097
He's originally from Oyster Bay,

04:48.099 --> 04:49.565
but he runs a boardinghouse
in the Bowery now.

04:49.601 --> 04:51.484
He's very smart. He's very discreet.

04:51.519 --> 04:53.936
Right, this Townsend, he...
what, he just volunteered?

04:53.938 --> 04:56.572
Well, he wants to, he
just doesn't know it yet.

04:56.608 --> 04:58.941
- Ah, Abe.
- Look, I'm travelling to see him tomorrow.

04:58.993 --> 05:01.527
I can't go back with this.
I can't go back there.

05:01.579 --> 05:03.613
Look, Ben, I know him. Trust me.

05:03.615 --> 05:06.249
Yeah, I do trust you, Abe. But Washington...

05:09.838 --> 05:12.705
Washington may not trust me.

05:12.757 --> 05:15.091
I... I... I've earned his
disappointment of late

05:15.126 --> 05:16.709
and I need something to make up for that.

05:16.761 --> 05:18.127
Something real or else I'm out.

05:18.179 --> 05:21.431
All right, all right. You... you go back

05:21.466 --> 05:23.433
and you tell Washington

05:23.468 --> 05:25.635
that I have found our man in New York.

Uh, uh... How can... hello.

06:31.630 --> 06:33.097
Good day.

06:33.132 --> 06:35.966
I was wondering, you remember the gift

06:36.018 --> 06:38.552
sent from my former
housemaid Abigail to her son?

06:38.604 --> 06:40.387
From Philadelphia, of course.

06:40.439 --> 06:42.606
Well, he was overjoyed to receive it

06:42.641 --> 06:45.809
and he quickly carved this for his mother.

06:45.861 --> 06:47.227
Oh.

06:47.279 --> 06:49.279
He has a talent for woodworks, you see.

06:49.315 --> 06:52.232
I was wondering if I could prevail upon you

06:52.284 --> 06:55.119
to send this back by way of the same post.

06:56.739 --> 06:58.822
Well, I...

06:58.874 --> 07:01.742
suppose it would travel
alongside a larger shipment.

07:01.794 --> 07:05.245
I confess, I'm curious
as to what's in this box.

07:05.297 --> 07:08.382
Ah. Well, it isn't ready to show yet.

07:08.417 --> 07:11.135
But I'll tell you what.

07:11.170 --> 07:12.669
If you return here tomorrow night,

07:12.671 --> 07:15.756
you will see what is in this
box standing right here.

07:15.808 --> 07:19.259
And if you but have the courage to look,

07:19.311 --> 07:22.312
you will perceive marvels that
will quite take your breath away.

07:22.348 --> 07:23.597
Marvels?

07:23.649 --> 07:26.817
Unlike anything you've ever known.

<i>Mr. Townsend, very good to see you again.</i>

08:41.760 --> 08:43.927
Damn cold day outside, but a very fine one.

08:43.979 --> 08:46.013
We're fully booked.

08:48.601 --> 08:50.567
Doesn't look it.

08:51.687 --> 08:53.770
Now the old room would be fine.

08:56.609 --> 08:59.359
I said there are no rooms here for you.

08:59.411 --> 09:02.362
So why don't you take your
studies somewhere else?

09:02.414 --> 09:04.281
Oh, no, I'm not here to study.

Huh? Come here, you.

10:08.381 --> 10:10.348
So you finally decided to
join the corporation, eh?

10:10.383 --> 10:12.600
- Aye, that's right.
- Come on, then.

10:17.691 --> 10:19.691
Jesus.

10:19.726 --> 10:21.943
It's a nice bit of piracy
you got there, Ryder.

10:21.978 --> 10:24.062
It's privateering, Caleb.

10:24.114 --> 10:26.230
- Ah, privateering.
- (Caleb laughs)

10:26.232 --> 10:28.900

Ah, apologies, then, sir.

Come by way of the sound, did you?

10:33.873 --> 10:35.039
New Jersey.

10:35.075 --> 10:37.875
Oh. Still playing soldier boy, then?

10:37.911 --> 10:40.745
That's right. My ass is paid by Congress.

10:40.797 --> 10:44.132
Ah, but you still set sail by your old ways

10:44.167 --> 10:45.667

Uh, that China silk.

- Oh.

11:04.020 --> 11:05.937
<i>Maybe that chandelier.</i>

11:07.273 --> 11:08.690
Maybe not that dildo.

11:12.946 --> 11:14.912
I'll tell you what, you throw
in that bust of old King Georgie

11:14.948 --> 11:17.782
and some of that cutlery,

11:17.834 --> 11:20.284

Let's drink on it.

11:23.923 --> 11:28.292
Some Madeira courtesy of
the good ship Margaretta.

Sit and drink with me.

you keep looking out to them trees.

Ahem.

Jim, you may not be as safe
here as you think you are.

11:46.813 --> 11:50.198
All right? I heard rumors
of Rangers in the woods.

11:50.233 --> 11:52.900
- And British patrols.
- No one can find us here.

11:52.952 --> 11:54.285
I found you.

11:54.320 --> 11:57.705
Yes, but you're a friend.

11:57.741 --> 12:00.291
Sit and drink!

Now, seeing as what you're really after

12:09.836 --> 12:11.836
is that bust of old King George,

maybe you can tell your
old friend Ryder why.

13:17.787 --> 13:20.571
that I can fight.

13:22.408 --> 13:25.243
That I can fight.

13:27.831 --> 13:30.581
I... (groans)

13:30.583 --> 13:32.717

13:32.752 --> 13:34.385
words that I should not have said.

Oh, sir, he speaks very highly of you.

- Does he?

13:38.925 --> 13:41.225
Does he know his friends?

13:41.261 --> 13:45.263
His enemies? Gates? Lee? Conway?

13:45.265 --> 13:46.681
You may not see it, Ben,

Judases and Machiavels.

I do see it, sir. Believe me, I do.

13:52.438 --> 13:54.438
Yes. Yes.

13:57.110 --> 13:59.827
You are a sharp one.

13:59.863 --> 14:01.996
A Yale man, right?

14:02.031 --> 14:03.865
- Yes, sir.
- Yes.

14:03.917 --> 14:05.950
I was supposed to attend there

14:06.002 --> 14:08.953
before my father drank my tuition

14:09.005 --> 14:12.123
and I was apprenticed to a druggist.

14:12.175 --> 14:16.043
My education was among
the sick and the weak.

14:16.095 --> 14:19.430
It was there that I learned to
hate the smell of weakness.

14:19.465 --> 14:22.934
The same wretched stench that
now seeps from my useless leg.

14:22.969 --> 14:25.853
- (Groans)
- Sir. Sir.

14:29.442 --> 14:31.559
It's all right. It's all right.

14:33.279 --> 14:35.479
Yeah.

14:35.481 --> 14:39.283
You know, Washington has a weakness, too.

14:40.787 --> 14:45.122
His belief that providence
will shield him from harm.

14:45.158 --> 14:49.327
But there will come a time when
he sees that he is all too mortal

14:49.329 --> 14:51.579
and it is up to us to protect him.

14:51.631 --> 14:53.214
But I cannot do it from this tent.

14:53.249 --> 14:55.833
I cannot do it alone.

14:55.835 --> 14:58.419
Tell me. Tell me what you need.

14:58.471 --> 15:01.088
André: <i>"Obliged to choose
between gold and his country,</i>

15:01.140 --> 15:05.042
<i>General Benedict Arnold would
doubtlessly select the former.</i>

15:05.078 --> 15:07.979
Crafty and designing, like
the snake in the garden,

15:08.014 --> 15:11.766
he nevertheless lacks that
beast's minimal sense of honor

15:11.818 --> 15:14.685
even if he shares its most
singular characteristic...

15:14.737 --> 15:18.489
An inability to walk on his own legs."

15:18.524 --> 15:20.524
Or leg, in this case.

15:20.577 --> 15:22.243
Provocative.

15:22.278 --> 15:25.196
But I thought your aim was
to turn the man to our side.

15:25.248 --> 15:27.081
Well, these aren't my words for him.

15:27.116 --> 15:28.199
You wrote them.

15:28.251 --> 15:30.034
But it is Charles Lee
who will give them voice

15:30.086 --> 15:32.003
and spread them throughout
Washington's camp.

15:32.038 --> 15:35.039
You see, sir, I am like the ventriloquist.

15:35.091 --> 15:37.124
And Lee is the dummy?

15:37.176 --> 15:40.127
I write them here, and he says it there.

15:40.179 --> 15:41.846
And in doing so, we twist the knife

15:41.881 --> 15:44.382
deeper into Arnold's already wounded vanity,

15:44.434 --> 15:48.052
softening him for the approach, as it were.

15:48.104 --> 15:50.137
Just arrived for you, sir.

15:56.362 --> 15:59.981
An invitation to tea at the
house of Judge Edward Shippen.

16:00.033 --> 16:03.567
Meaning Peggy Shippen,

16:03.569 --> 16:06.203
a far prettier puppet.

16:06.239 --> 16:09.707
Tell me, John, do you have your
hand up her backside as well?

16:12.378 --> 16:15.046
(laughing) Great tale, Brewster.

16:15.081 --> 16:18.132
Wild. Robert Rogers, a bobtailed wench,

16:18.167 --> 16:19.717
and a tattling terrier.

16:19.752 --> 16:21.886
- (laughs)
- <i> Aye, and all of it true.</i>

16:21.921 --> 16:24.255
So consider my trade...

16:24.257 --> 16:26.390
I take the bust, yeah,

16:26.426 --> 16:27.725
and let Rogers hunt me.

16:27.760 --> 16:30.645
I don't know.

16:30.680 --> 16:32.680
Seems like if it's that important,

16:32.732 --> 16:36.651
I might swing a better deal
from them lobster backs.

16:38.104 --> 16:42.106
Yeah. In case you didn't hear me, Jim,

16:42.158 --> 16:44.025
the letter inside that bust you stole,

16:44.077 --> 16:47.111
it's meant for General
George Washington himself.

16:47.113 --> 16:48.612
Whose side are you on?

16:48.665 --> 16:51.282
That depends.

16:51.334 --> 16:55.119
How much is General George
willing to pay for old King George?

16:55.121 --> 16:56.620
(laughs)

16:56.622 --> 16:59.040
(hatchet thunks)

17:03.046 --> 17:05.212
- (gunfire)
- (men shouting)

17:05.263 --> 17:08.632
- General quarters!
- Men: General quarters!

17:27.453 --> 17:28.869
Drop it!

17:28.905 --> 17:30.538
Good idea.

18:05.003 --> 18:07.469
<i>(Quiet chatter)</i>

18:09.207 --> 18:11.323
Good morning, Major André.

18:11.325 --> 18:14.243
We are honored you accepted our invitation.

18:14.295 --> 18:17.296
I must insist, sir, the honor
and pleasure is all mine.

18:17.331 --> 18:20.599
<i>Miss Shippen, how
wonderful to see you again.</i>

18:20.635 --> 18:23.219
You brighten the darkest
room on the dullest day.

18:23.254 --> 18:25.888
You're too kind, Major. Tea?

18:25.923 --> 18:28.140
Major, please.

18:28.176 --> 18:31.143
Let me introduce these other gentlemen.

18:31.179 --> 18:34.230
Mr. Hezekiah Shagg, my lawyer.

18:34.265 --> 18:37.183
Mr. Percival Pidcock, banker.

18:37.185 --> 18:39.685
And the Reverend Mr. Runt, secretary.

18:40.822 --> 18:42.688
Now, ahem...

18:45.493 --> 18:49.028
To begin, we are all aware

18:49.030 --> 18:51.497
that a sufficient income

18:51.532 --> 18:53.866
and the right sort of breeding are vital

18:53.868 --> 18:56.335
<i>to a happy and independent marriage.</i>

18:57.371 --> 18:58.871
Beg pardon?

18:58.873 --> 19:02.124
If you wish the hand of my daughter,

19:02.176 --> 19:04.126
we must elicit whether or not

19:04.178 --> 19:06.345
you're a suitable match for this family.

19:06.380 --> 19:08.948
I believe there's been
some misunderstanding, sir.

19:08.983 --> 19:12.468
I have not proposed
anything to Miss Shippen.

19:14.055 --> 19:16.722
(Whispers)

19:16.724 --> 19:20.226
We'll take your denial
as assumed, of course.

19:20.278 --> 19:22.278
Now, tell us, your family assets,

19:22.313 --> 19:25.364
- are they in land or in trade?
- Father.

19:28.703 --> 19:31.237
Who are your people?

19:31.239 --> 19:35.991
André doesn't strike one
as quite English, does it?

19:36.043 --> 19:37.793
French, maybe.

19:40.798 --> 19:43.415
I must apologize, sir.

19:43.467 --> 19:45.801
I'm afraid I have a prior engagement.

19:45.837 --> 19:49.505
Lord Howe requires my counsel this morning.

19:49.557 --> 19:51.473
Judge Shippen.

19:51.509 --> 19:53.142
Miss Shippen.

19:54.178 --> 19:56.312
Man: <i> Sir... (whispering)</i>

19:56.347 --> 19:58.564
(laughs) Of course.

20:00.434 --> 20:02.234
Allow me to save you some time.

20:02.270 --> 20:04.820
<i>My people are from mercantile stock.</i>

20:04.856 --> 20:07.106
My father Swiss, my mother French.

20:07.158 --> 20:10.025
Huguenots. No land, new money.

20:10.077 --> 20:12.828
Like you, sir, though less of it, I suspect.

20:12.864 --> 20:17.082
Possibly owing to the fact that my father
chose to invest in 4% government bonds

20:17.118 --> 20:20.619
rather than on the backs
of West Indian slaves.

20:24.258 --> 20:25.424
Margaret.

20:25.459 --> 20:27.676
I am so sorry.

20:27.712 --> 20:30.129
I... I had no idea he was going to do that.

20:30.181 --> 20:32.464
All I said to him was that
I was impressed by you,

20:32.516 --> 20:34.800
that you were a well-appointed
officer and a fine actor.

20:34.802 --> 20:37.803
I am an excellent officer and
I don't like being ambushed.

20:37.855 --> 20:39.605
Good-bye, mademoiselle.

20:46.397 --> 20:48.981
(Chatter, laughter)

21:04.715 --> 21:07.833
I thought I'd wait till nightfall
so we could speak in confidence.

21:07.835 --> 21:10.502
Do you play draughts, Mr. Woodhull?

21:12.974 --> 21:15.090
You don't remember from before?

21:17.178 --> 21:19.511
I play a little, yeah.

21:19.563 --> 21:21.263
That's what good players always say

21:21.315 --> 21:22.848
to keep their opponent off guard.

21:22.850 --> 21:25.484
- Do you play?
- A little.

21:28.689 --> 21:30.856
So, Mr. Townsend...

21:32.860 --> 21:34.693
what are the stakes?

21:35.913 --> 21:38.697
After I win and you go,

21:38.749 --> 21:40.032
you stay gone.

21:40.034 --> 21:42.034
And what if I win?

21:44.038 --> 21:47.256
The king or Britannia.

21:47.291 --> 21:48.924
Bit of a tough choice for you?

21:48.960 --> 21:52.127
You go first. I insist.

21:58.803 --> 22:00.719
Where are you from, Mr. Townsend?

22:00.721 --> 22:02.104
Near you, I believe.

22:02.139 --> 22:03.806
- Long Island, then?
- Mm.

22:03.858 --> 22:05.441
Perhaps our fathers are acquainted.

22:05.476 --> 22:07.693
Perhaps. Your father is?

22:07.728 --> 22:09.561
Richard Woodhull, the magistrate.

22:09.613 --> 22:12.531
I don't believe my father knows
any Woodhulls, I'm afraid.

22:12.566 --> 22:16.735
There was a Townsend,
I recall, over in Oyster Bay.

22:17.571 --> 22:19.621
A Samuel.

22:19.657 --> 22:24.493
A very worthy gent,
if Whiggish in his views.

22:27.131 --> 22:28.747
Like father, like son?

22:28.799 --> 22:32.301
The sins of the father should
not be visited upon the son.

22:32.336 --> 22:35.337
Surely you agree.

22:35.389 --> 22:37.589
I agree that every man should move

22:37.641 --> 22:40.225
according to his own belief.

22:41.762 --> 22:44.063
Why do you not crown your man?

22:44.098 --> 22:45.814
I don't want a king.

22:45.850 --> 22:47.566
Why ever not?

22:47.601 --> 22:49.518
Because it's more profitable for me

22:49.570 --> 22:51.687
to keep a man behind the enemy line.

22:51.739 --> 22:54.656
To spy out the land?

22:54.692 --> 22:57.526
If called upon, yes.

23:01.832 --> 23:04.166
Pity, my king just killed your spy.

23:04.201 --> 23:06.502
How much longer do you
want to talk around it?

23:06.537 --> 23:08.871
- Do you forfeit?
- Why did you do it?

23:10.758 --> 23:13.008
You held my life in your hands.

23:13.044 --> 23:15.294
You could have given that egg
to the British and watch me hang

23:15.346 --> 23:17.096
from the gallows and earned
yourself a fat reward.

23:17.131 --> 23:19.631
Or do you make enough money
housing British soldiers?

23:19.633 --> 23:21.100
Don't ever presume to know me.

23:21.135 --> 23:22.885
Well, then enlighten me, Robert.

23:22.937 --> 23:25.137
Or ask me a question. I
will answer with the truth.

23:25.189 --> 23:28.357
I already know the truth about you.

23:28.392 --> 23:30.642
Oh, you think so?

23:30.644 --> 23:33.395
You are a boy

23:33.447 --> 23:36.281
playing a man playing a spy.

23:36.317 --> 23:39.401
<i>And each one a liar.</i>

23:39.453 --> 23:41.653
The son of a Tory magistrate

23:41.705 --> 23:46.708
who risks his life and others
to rebel against his father.

23:51.916 --> 23:56.218
You're not the only man who can
investigate another's history.

23:57.421 --> 24:00.005
There was a young Captain Woodhull

24:00.007 --> 24:04.309
who died during the Liberty
Pole Riots not far from here.

24:04.345 --> 24:07.179
Seems painfully coincidental to me

24:07.231 --> 24:09.314
that the registrar shows you withdrawing

24:09.350 --> 24:12.601
from King's College so soon after.

24:14.321 --> 24:17.106
<i>You married your brother's
intended, did you not?</i>

24:17.158 --> 24:19.858
Tell me, was she worth it?

24:19.860 --> 24:22.611
(Pieces clatter)

24:23.697 --> 24:26.698
Forfeit. You lose.

24:26.700 --> 24:29.585
And you always have a way out.

24:29.620 --> 24:31.787
Don't you?

24:31.839 --> 24:33.422
Always a place to hide.

24:33.457 --> 24:35.090
<i>(Door opens)</i>

24:39.046 --> 24:41.130
Any rooms to let?

24:41.182 --> 24:43.132
One just opened up.

24:46.971 --> 24:49.104
I used to be just like you

24:49.140 --> 24:51.890
and it sickens me now.

24:54.395 --> 24:57.563
You are planning to return, Mr. Woodhull?

25:01.035 --> 25:03.152
To finish our game.

25:05.539 --> 25:08.624
I believe we said best out of three.

25:15.966 --> 25:18.250
<i>(Door opens, closes)</i>

25:34.685 --> 25:36.318
Hey!

25:43.694 --> 25:46.945
Whoa, where are you running to?

25:49.116 --> 25:50.449
You picked the wrong alley.

25:50.501 --> 25:52.951
Begging your gentlemen's pardon,

25:53.003 --> 25:56.455
Dr. Jehoshaphat Tongue at your service.

25:56.457 --> 25:59.124
<i>Formerly fellow of Magdalene
College, Cambridge,</i>

25:59.176 --> 26:01.627
but now, as you can see,

26:01.679 --> 26:03.378
sadly impoverished,

26:03.430 --> 26:06.465
defrocked, and greatly needful

26:06.467 --> 26:08.634
of all you can spare.

26:08.636 --> 26:10.852
None of that, you nonce.

26:10.888 --> 26:12.471
<i>(Man groans)</i>

26:12.523 --> 26:15.557
- (groans)
- He's got a knife!

26:19.480 --> 26:21.530
Let him go!

26:21.565 --> 26:22.698
Let him go!

26:33.577 --> 26:34.876
Let's go!

26:36.163 --> 26:37.129
(Groaning)

26:37.164 --> 26:39.965
Man: <i>Come on! Come on!</i>

26:43.170 --> 26:44.886
Don't touch it! Don't touch it!

26:44.922 --> 26:46.755
Come on, we've got to go. We've got to go.

26:46.807 --> 26:49.391
On your feet. On your feet.

26:51.011 --> 26:54.479
- Who are you?
- Your father said just to follow you.

26:54.515 --> 26:56.431
- That's all.
- Wait, my father?

26:56.483 --> 27:00.068
- Who are you?
- Henry Browning.

27:00.104 --> 27:01.820
From Hempstead.

27:01.855 --> 27:04.940
Could you see that my wife
receives my pay from the judge?

27:04.992 --> 27:07.609
- (Screams)
- Jesus!

27:10.748 --> 27:14.333
- Man 2: <i> Guards! Guards!</i>
- Woman: <i> Fetch the regulars!</i>

27:16.203 --> 27:17.919
I'm sorry.

27:17.955 --> 27:20.038
I'm sorry.

27:26.347 --> 27:29.982
- Soldier: <i> Right!</i>
- Soldier #2: <i> Prime your firelocks!</i>

27:52.212 --> 27:54.245
Major André.

27:58.251 --> 28:00.835
Miss Shippen.

28:00.887 --> 28:03.638
Is there anything else I can help you with?

28:03.673 --> 28:07.141
I wish to apologize once again
for my father's behavior.

28:07.176 --> 28:08.643
It was highly improper.

28:08.678 --> 28:11.262
I wonder what he would think
of your behavior right now.

28:11.264 --> 28:13.981
A young woman visiting a bachelor officer

28:14.017 --> 28:17.268
of questionable means without chaperone.

28:17.320 --> 28:19.020
Pray, do not condescend to me.

28:19.072 --> 28:20.488
Why not?

28:20.523 --> 28:22.607
One good turn deserves another.

28:22.609 --> 28:25.276
Tell your father I've
entertained the affections

28:25.278 --> 28:28.029
of duchesses with 100,000 acres

28:28.081 --> 28:30.915
and pedigrees going back to Charlemagne.

28:32.919 --> 28:34.702
You entertained them, you say?

28:34.754 --> 28:36.671
Or were you the entertainment?

28:38.091 --> 28:40.291
You can tell me the truth.

28:40.293 --> 28:42.843
I know I've been both.

28:42.879 --> 28:45.012
Don't presume you know what it is to be me.

28:45.048 --> 28:47.048
I had to earn my way in this world.

28:47.100 --> 28:50.351
It wasn't served to me on a china plate.

28:50.386 --> 28:53.437
This judgment has been passed on you before.

28:56.276 --> 28:57.942
What was her name?

28:57.977 --> 28:59.644
You come here to rub salt in the wound?

28:59.646 --> 29:01.779
I'm not my family, John,

29:01.814 --> 29:04.565
as you are not yours.

29:04.617 --> 29:06.484
I told my father I was impressed by you.

29:06.486 --> 29:08.369
I never say that about anyone.

29:08.404 --> 29:10.454
It's what made him so afraid.

29:12.492 --> 29:15.793
You're a man who makes
his own fate, and I...

29:18.998 --> 29:21.465
I wish to be a part of it.

29:25.922 --> 29:28.756
You should listen to
your father, young lady.

29:28.808 --> 29:30.758
You are the prize of Philadelphia,

29:30.810 --> 29:33.311
the favorite daughter of
its wealthiest patron,

29:33.346 --> 29:35.980
the most beautiful woman in America.

29:36.015 --> 29:39.183
You must have heard those
platitudes a thousand times before.

29:39.185 --> 29:42.320
What could possibly impress
you more than that?

29:45.024 --> 29:48.192
Don't presume you know what it is to be me.

30:18.891 --> 30:20.975
Major Hewlett.

30:21.978 --> 30:23.644
Oh, you've come.

30:23.696 --> 30:25.279
As I said.

30:25.314 --> 30:26.731
I hope I'm not interrupting.

30:26.733 --> 30:28.149
No, no, no, no. Not at all.

30:28.201 --> 30:30.234
Not at all. Here.

30:30.236 --> 30:31.902
Come look.

30:34.207 --> 30:35.656
What is it?

30:35.708 --> 30:37.742
This is a reflecting telescope.

30:37.744 --> 30:39.710
It's the very latest of its kind.

30:39.746 --> 30:41.328
Look.

30:45.551 --> 30:47.585
<i>(Anna gasps) What is that?</i>

30:47.587 --> 30:49.670
Hewlett: <i>They are the constellations.</i>

30:49.722 --> 30:51.255
<i>Only closer.</i>

30:51.257 --> 30:53.424
You were right, this is a marvel.

30:53.426 --> 30:56.761
Yes. This one's mirror was cast, ground,

30:56.763 --> 30:59.313
and polished by William Herschel himself.

30:59.348 --> 31:01.265
William...?

31:01.267 --> 31:02.650
Herschel.

31:02.685 --> 31:05.319
The greatest astronomer of our age.

31:05.354 --> 31:08.522
We've long been in correspondence

31:08.574 --> 31:10.608
and he has recently confided to me

31:10.660 --> 31:13.994
there may be a seventh
planet in our solar system.

31:14.030 --> 31:16.113
I suggested to him that if he finds it,

31:16.115 --> 31:18.866
he should christen it
Georgium after our king.

31:22.121 --> 31:26.340
The heavens are serene and eternal,
Mrs. Strong,

31:26.375 --> 31:28.008
their movements predictable.

31:28.044 --> 31:31.295
There is a divine law
and order to the universe

31:31.297 --> 31:33.464
just as there is to our empire.

31:35.101 --> 31:37.301
Am I to presume you wanted

31:37.303 --> 31:39.220
to be an astronomer and not a soldier?

31:39.272 --> 31:42.807
Well, it is true that the
stars were my calling.

31:42.859 --> 31:47.478
But the American trade boycotts
almost bankrupted my father.

31:47.530 --> 31:50.948
One must earn a living. The army beckoned.

31:50.983 --> 31:53.067
And then this rebellion came

31:53.119 --> 31:56.987
and, well, here I sit.

31:58.241 --> 32:00.074
I admit, when I first saw this,

32:00.126 --> 32:02.376
I thought it some kind of cannon.

32:02.411 --> 32:05.296
(laughs) Yes.

32:05.331 --> 32:09.333
To be aimed across the sound
at our rebel counterparts.

32:09.335 --> 32:13.721
Yes, I suppose we could
use it as a spyglass.

32:18.311 --> 32:19.927
<i>On a clear day,</i>

32:19.979 --> 32:23.430
<i>possibly at a lovely
outpost much like this one,</i>

32:23.483 --> 32:26.016
<i>you might even see them.</i>

32:31.991 --> 32:35.576
(laughing)

32:36.946 --> 32:38.579
You hear the one about the Irish soldier

32:38.614 --> 32:41.365
who upon being asked by his
captain, "What's a fortification?"

32:41.417 --> 32:45.202
answered, "It takes two twentifications
to make a fortification"?

32:45.204 --> 32:48.372
(Men groan, laugh)

32:50.209 --> 32:53.427
Man: <i>Have I told you the one
about the builder's wife?</i>

32:53.462 --> 32:55.846
- Man ♪2: <i> Oh, no!
- (men groan)</i>

32:59.685 --> 33:02.686
Man: <i>It's the only one I've got.</i>

33:02.722 --> 33:05.222
Beautiful sky tonight.

33:06.726 --> 33:11.028
I find myself constantly
impressed by modern science.

33:11.063 --> 33:13.397
It gives me hope to hear it

33:13.449 --> 33:18.035
for we are at the birth of a new age, Anna.

33:18.070 --> 33:22.456
Hewlett: <i>A struggle between men of reason</i>

33:22.491 --> 33:26.160
<i>and men of blood, of base instinct,</i>

33:26.212 --> 33:29.580
<i>contending for the soul of mankind.</i>

33:34.420 --> 33:35.836
Damn you.

33:35.888 --> 33:39.306
Skulking in here like Indians.

33:39.342 --> 33:41.675
Who... (groans)

33:46.015 --> 33:48.315
Travel safe.

33:48.351 --> 33:52.186
Hewlett: <i>A war between
men who desire civility</i>

33:52.238 --> 33:54.605
<i>and those who crave savagery.</i>

33:54.657 --> 33:56.907
<i>Between those golden in head and heart</i>

33:56.943 --> 34:00.027
<i>and those red in tooth and claw.</i>

34:00.079 --> 34:04.865
<i>And if reason loses,
there will be pandemonium</i>

34:04.917 --> 34:06.667
<i>or hell to pay.</i>

34:06.702 --> 34:11.338
I for one put my faith in reason and order.

34:11.373 --> 34:14.958
For example, I believe that Halley's Comet

34:15.011 --> 34:18.295
will return precisely on schedule in 1835,

34:18.297 --> 34:20.380
like celestial clockwork,

34:20.433 --> 34:23.766
as a mark of the Lord's
favor towards our empire.

34:24.804 --> 34:26.387
Amen, sir.

34:28.975 --> 34:33.110
Anna, may I request that you call me Edmund?

34:33.145 --> 34:35.980
At least when we're alone?

34:36.032 --> 34:38.399
- Edmund?
- Yes.

34:38.451 --> 34:40.818
Named after Halley himself.

34:48.159 --> 34:50.911
Well, Edmund...

34:50.963 --> 34:52.161
it's getting late.

34:52.164 --> 34:54.214
Yes.

34:54.250 --> 34:56.467
My men will escort you home.

35:00.339 --> 35:02.172
(Sighs)

35:13.185 --> 35:15.819
Why do you need the tongue?

35:15.855 --> 35:18.022
To put a fine point on it.

35:21.877 --> 35:26.144
__

35:29.315 --> 35:33.086
(Groans)

35:38.249 --> 35:40.749
- Impressed?
- Very much so, sir.

35:40.801 --> 35:43.418
Wait until you hear this.

35:43.420 --> 35:46.088
"It has been several
years since last we met,

35:46.090 --> 35:50.058
yet I recall your gentlemanly mien

35:50.094 --> 35:52.561
and abounding vigor

35:52.596 --> 35:55.264
and pray that you are rapidly returned

35:55.266 --> 35:57.649
to your former health."

35:57.685 --> 36:00.102
- Guess who it's from.
- No idea.

36:00.154 --> 36:03.322
Miss Peggy Shippen of Philadelphia.

36:03.357 --> 36:05.357
Oh, she's very rich, you know?

36:05.409 --> 36:07.442
Remarkable to receive more goodwill

36:07.444 --> 36:10.362
from the enemy's lines
than one's own colleagues.

36:10.414 --> 36:13.865
Speaking of, what news
from the viper's nest?

36:13.918 --> 36:17.953
Well, it's just as you suspected, sir.

36:18.005 --> 36:20.455
General Lee and General
Gates fear to denigrate

36:20.507 --> 36:23.792
the commander to his face, but they
certainly exchange looks behind his back.

36:23.794 --> 36:25.210
Cowards.

36:25.262 --> 36:28.096
They hide in the shadows
just like in the field.

36:28.132 --> 36:30.432
Well, they are not, however,

36:30.467 --> 36:33.268
afraid to denigrate you, sir.

36:35.773 --> 36:37.773
How?

36:37.808 --> 36:39.775
What did they say?

36:41.812 --> 36:44.730
They say if obliged to choose

36:44.782 --> 36:47.399
between gold and his country,

36:47.451 --> 36:49.618
you would select the former.

36:51.121 --> 36:54.706
They say that you lack even
a minimal sense of honor.

36:58.412 --> 37:01.496
And was Washington present

37:01.548 --> 37:03.332
when these things were said?

37:03.334 --> 37:06.134
Yes, sir, he was.

37:06.170 --> 37:09.338
And what was his contribution?

37:09.340 --> 37:11.340
He made none, sir.

37:11.342 --> 37:15.811
He neither spoke in your
defense nor spoke against you.

37:15.846 --> 37:17.896
He said nothing.

37:21.185 --> 37:23.018
Leave it.

37:30.277 --> 37:34.529
Sir, has the position of your
aide-de-camp been filled?

37:35.783 --> 37:39.451
For if not, I wish to apply for the post.

37:41.038 --> 37:43.038
And what of your...

37:43.090 --> 37:46.425
special assignment for Washington?

37:46.460 --> 37:49.211
I can fulfill both duties, sir.

37:49.263 --> 37:52.347
- Neither will detract from the other.
- Really?

37:52.383 --> 37:54.633
What is this secret detail

37:54.685 --> 37:57.052
that you cannot possibly relinquish?

37:59.890 --> 38:03.058
Intelligence, sir.

38:03.060 --> 38:05.227
Acquisition, translation.

38:06.697 --> 38:09.781
- Intelligence?
- Yes, sir.

38:09.817 --> 38:13.902
Tell me, where is the
personal honor in that?

38:13.904 --> 38:17.322
What I mean to say, Benjamin,
is that you are a man of blood,

38:17.374 --> 38:19.241
not some deskbound clerk.

38:19.243 --> 38:21.626
You can be a spy

38:21.662 --> 38:24.129
or you can be a soldier,

38:24.164 --> 38:26.748
but you can't be both.

38:26.750 --> 38:28.667
If you wish to serve at my side,

38:28.719 --> 38:31.253
then you must give that up.

38:44.101 --> 38:45.767
<i>(Door opens)</i>

38:45.769 --> 38:48.019
Abraham.

38:49.156 --> 38:50.989
You back so soon?

38:51.024 --> 38:53.442
- What?
- Come here.

38:53.494 --> 38:55.110
- He's dead.
- What?

38:55.112 --> 38:58.780
- You heard me. Don't play the fool.
- Get off.

38:58.782 --> 39:00.615
- Who was he?
- What are you talking about?

39:00.667 --> 39:02.784
Henry Browning of Hempstead!

39:02.786 --> 39:04.920
He... he was just to follow you.

39:04.955 --> 39:06.421
- Tell me what you were doing.
- Who was he?!

39:06.457 --> 39:09.291
Just a petty thief. He
stole a horse once and I...

39:09.293 --> 39:11.510
Oh, my God, what am I gonna tell his wife?

39:11.545 --> 39:14.129
His widow.

39:14.131 --> 39:17.933
And you can tell her that he was
gutted by an alley gang in New York.

39:17.968 --> 39:19.384
But then you'd also have to tell her

39:19.436 --> 39:20.969
what he was really doing
there, wouldn't you?

39:21.021 --> 39:22.854
What were you doing there?

39:22.890 --> 39:25.974
Gentlemen. What is this about?

39:27.528 --> 39:30.395
Let me guess. Your recent trip to New York.

39:30.447 --> 39:32.981
I told your father what
you were doing there.

39:33.033 --> 39:34.816
If you want your wife to know about it,

39:34.818 --> 39:37.068
I suggest you continue to raise a ruckus.

39:37.121 --> 39:39.571
Major, why did you tell him?

39:39.623 --> 39:41.373
He saw us talking the other night.

39:41.408 --> 39:43.408
I tried to honor your request

39:43.460 --> 39:45.076
for discretion, both of yours,

39:45.129 --> 39:48.914
but there are too many secrets in this
household and for no good reason.

39:48.966 --> 39:50.832
We're on the same side.

39:52.169 --> 39:54.085
You were right.

39:54.138 --> 39:58.006
Abraham, I was worried that you
were putting your life in danger.

39:58.058 --> 40:01.176
But I was wrong to lay hands on you.

40:01.228 --> 40:04.813
And you were justified in fighting back.

40:06.350 --> 40:08.016
Well, there's nothing for it.

40:08.068 --> 40:10.101
We're here, we are up.

40:10.154 --> 40:14.739
We should listen to your report
from the city, both of us.

40:21.031 --> 40:23.748
(Clearing throat)

40:23.784 --> 40:26.701
So, when last we met,

40:26.753 --> 40:30.872
you were on the trail of
a man named Hondrick.

40:30.924 --> 40:33.592
Isn't that the name of a Mohawk chieftain?

40:33.627 --> 40:36.378
Richard, please. You'll find
that the intrigues played

40:36.430 --> 40:38.797
by these miscreants are quite byzantine.

40:38.849 --> 40:41.049
- Indeed.
- Go on.

40:42.803 --> 40:46.721
One problem they cannot
avoid, sir, is communication.

40:46.773 --> 40:50.725
Now, I remember that the Sons of
Liberty would use a secret drop

40:50.727 --> 40:52.277
to pass messages to each other

40:52.312 --> 40:55.230
and that was hidden under a
loose brick in an old wall.

40:55.232 --> 40:57.816
<i>And I thought maybe it was still in use.</i>

40:57.868 --> 40:59.818
<i>So I went there last night,</i>

40:59.870 --> 41:02.404
I looked under the brick,
and I found a note.

41:02.406 --> 41:04.456
Go on. Go on. What did it say?

41:04.491 --> 41:06.074
Gibberish, sir.

41:06.076 --> 41:09.828
<i>Nothing but a jumble of numbers
and letters, I'm afraid.</i>

41:09.880 --> 41:11.746
- Enciphered.
- Exactly.

41:11.748 --> 41:13.748
So where is the note?

41:13.750 --> 41:16.051
Surely you brought it back with you?

41:17.804 --> 41:19.638
Well, if I'd...

41:19.673 --> 41:22.924
If I took the note, I thought
they'd know someone was onto them.

41:22.926 --> 41:26.428
- So...
- So another dead end. How inconvenient.

41:26.430 --> 41:28.597
(Sighs)

41:28.599 --> 41:31.266
Well, not quite.

41:32.269 --> 41:34.986
No, I... I decided to wait there

41:35.022 --> 41:36.821
to see if someone would come
along and pick up the note.

41:36.857 --> 41:38.907
And around midnight, someone did.

41:38.942 --> 41:41.693
- And you recognized him?
- No.

41:41.745 --> 41:44.246
But I followed them through streets,

41:44.281 --> 41:46.114
<i>and alleyways, sir,</i>

41:46.166 --> 41:49.451
then I waited while he stopped in a tavern.

41:51.088 --> 41:52.587
The Merry Monarch, it was called.

41:52.623 --> 41:55.040
And I described our stranger
to the barkeep there,

41:55.092 --> 41:56.791
claiming that he dropped a couple shillings

41:56.843 --> 41:58.543
from his bag and I was keen to return them.

41:58.595 --> 42:00.595
And he was very happy to give me his name.

42:01.598 --> 42:03.965
Henry Browning of Hempstead.

42:06.303 --> 42:10.889
