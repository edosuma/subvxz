00:24.560 --> 00:26.960
Hello and welcome to Top Gear.

00:26.960 --> 00:29.640
Tonight, we've got Porsche vs Lamborghini.

00:29.640 --> 00:32.759
And Chris Harris vs a large wall.

00:32.759 --> 00:35.160
But we begin with Alfa Romeo.

00:35.160 --> 00:38.720
Back in the '60s, Alfa created cars like this, the GTA,

00:38.720 --> 00:43.520
that were genuine world-beaters - fast, cutting edge and brilliant.

00:43.520 --> 00:45.640
The trouble is since those heady times,

00:45.640 --> 00:48.000
the Alfa story has been one of disappointment,

00:48.000 --> 00:50.400
false dawn and disappointment.

00:50.400 --> 00:53.720
But now there's a new Alfa that finally promises

00:53.720 --> 00:55.800
to bring back the good old days.

01:00.800 --> 01:07.760
This is the Alfa Romeo Giulia and, like any good Alfa, it's a looker.

01:07.760 --> 01:11.800
But, like no Alfa four-door in a very long time,

01:11.800 --> 01:15.520
the Giulia is rear-wheel drive and under the bonnet

01:15.520 --> 01:18.400
of this Â£59,000 Quadrifoglio version

01:18.400 --> 01:23.720
is a twin turbo V6, making over 500hp.

01:26.720 --> 01:31.160
Exciting headlines, but, come on, this is Alfa.

01:31.160 --> 01:34.800
It can't possibly live up to the promise... can it?

01:42.240 --> 01:43.560
Oh, yes, it can!

01:46.160 --> 01:48.320
This thing is mighty...

01:49.800 --> 01:51.560
..in just about every area.

01:53.840 --> 01:55.960
But I've got to start with that engine.

01:58.800 --> 02:03.360
It's effectively a Ferrari V8 with two cylinders lopped off the front.

02:03.360 --> 02:08.960
So, what you have is an Alfa Romeo saloon powered by a Ferrari engine.

02:10.360 --> 02:11.680
How cool is that?

02:15.200 --> 02:17.120
And then there's the way it works.

02:17.120 --> 02:22.200
It does an incredible impression of a normally aspirated engine.

02:22.200 --> 02:25.200
At the top where most turbo engines kind of run out of puff,

02:25.200 --> 02:26.440
this one keeps going.

02:28.440 --> 02:32.080
That V6 is a fraud in the most perfect way.

02:36.440 --> 02:37.880
It's so fast!

02:43.520 --> 02:45.520
But there's no point having all that power

02:45.520 --> 02:47.360
and torque if the chassis can't cope.

02:50.480 --> 02:54.480
And that's the genius of this car - the chassis can cope.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.320
There's so much grip on these roads,

02:59.320 --> 03:04.200
you can just fire it into turns at unbelievable speed.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.160
And the whole thing just feels so composed.

03:09.160 --> 03:10.760
That's the word - composed.

03:17.600 --> 03:20.800
They've even done serious things, like weight saving.

03:20.800 --> 03:24.560
Large areas of the bodywork are made from carbon fibre.

03:24.560 --> 03:27.720
Most of the interior is covered in the stuff.

03:27.720 --> 03:34.200
And what isn't carbon fibre is aluminium. It's all very convincing.

03:34.200 --> 03:37.200
And then there's where you sit.

03:39.520 --> 03:42.120
Italy has spent decades perfecting the art

03:42.120 --> 03:43.680
of the awful driving position.

03:43.680 --> 03:46.160
It's a matter of national pride, but somehow they've managed

03:46.160 --> 03:50.280
to forget it all with this car because these seats are perfect.

03:50.280 --> 03:52.600
This steering wheel is in just the right place.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.640
I can only assume that, at some point in the early '70s,

04:00.640 --> 04:05.080
all the Alfa engineers that knew about making a car fun to drive

04:05.080 --> 04:07.640
got accidentally locked in a store cupboard

04:07.640 --> 04:12.840
and that at some point last year, Alfa found the key.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.920
All those years spent reworking flabby front-wheel drive Fiats,

04:27.920 --> 04:31.320
all those disappointments we've endured -

04:31.320 --> 04:36.520
at last, this Giulia is the real deal.

04:38.360 --> 04:40.600
I can't believe this is happening.

04:40.600 --> 04:44.800
This is one of the best moments of my year so far. Ha-ha!

04:46.320 --> 04:50.160
And I know this is the bit where I'm supposed to reveal the big "but" -

04:50.160 --> 04:53.840
to conclude that, yes, the Giulia is interesting,

04:53.840 --> 04:56.520
but still basically rubbish.

04:58.400 --> 04:59.680
But it isn't.

05:01.120 --> 05:05.200
It isn't rubbish at all. It's magnificent!

05:07.080 --> 05:10.960
And that, ironically, is the problem.

05:18.880 --> 05:21.880
Now Alfa's finally created a car capable of mixing it

05:21.880 --> 05:24.800
with the best in the world, it's going to have to...

05:24.800 --> 05:27.560
Well, you can see where this is going.

05:27.560 --> 05:31.920
That is the BMW M3.

05:34.520 --> 05:37.960
The sort of car unlikely to be amused

05:37.960 --> 05:41.320
by some pretty-faced Italian muscling in on its patch.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.360
Oh, no, you don't, Wolfgang!

05:56.200 --> 06:01.880
The M3 really is the defining super saloon of our era.

06:01.880 --> 06:05.200
It's a spectacular car and I adore it, I really do.

06:08.720 --> 06:10.720
This thing really can live with it.

06:13.760 --> 06:17.920
I've got more power, I've got more torque, I've got less weight.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.440
What's not to love?

06:21.240 --> 06:25.000
This Alfa is all over this BMW, whether he likes it or not!

06:28.040 --> 06:29.720
Ooh-ah! Thug!

06:29.720 --> 06:32.320
He may have a bit more lowdown punch

06:32.320 --> 06:35.200
and his interior plastics may be a bit better.

06:35.200 --> 06:38.120
Look, this arm rest, that could come off at any point,

06:38.120 --> 06:43.320
but I know which car I'd rather be in right now and it's not the M3.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.920
I can't believe I'm saying that, but it's not the M3.

06:50.320 --> 06:54.720
I'm going sideways in a 500hp Alfa Romeo!

06:54.720 --> 06:57.200
And that's a beautiful thing!

06:59.360 --> 07:01.920
You can slide this car anywhere you want.

07:01.920 --> 07:03.840
Wow!

07:05.480 --> 07:08.800
And just look what happens when you get it onto the straight.

07:08.800 --> 07:12.200
0-100mph in 8.2 seconds

07:12.200 --> 07:15.400
and 190mph flat out.

07:16.920 --> 07:18.880
God, this thing is fast!

07:24.960 --> 07:28.720
So, and I almost can't believe I'm finally saying this,

07:28.720 --> 07:33.440
Alfa's done it - built a super saloon to beat the very best.

07:33.440 --> 07:36.440
It's like England finally winning the World Cup -

07:36.440 --> 07:40.520
a day many had hoped for, but, in their heart of hearts,

07:40.520 --> 07:43.440
never believed could really happen.

07:43.440 --> 07:47.600
- Rory, what are you doing?
- Well, I couldn't help but hear you saying...

07:47.600 --> 07:52.400
Stop there! That you could slide this car anywhere you want.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.200
Well, I thought you might want to prove it.

07:54.200 --> 07:56.760
So, you want me to skid sideways through that?

07:56.760 --> 07:58.720
Exactly.

07:58.720 --> 08:02.640
- What's it made of?
- It's a frangible material.

08:02.640 --> 08:05.320
- What, so it's made of almonds?
- No, it's frangible.

08:05.320 --> 08:07.000
What does that mean?

08:07.000 --> 08:08.240
I don't actually know.

08:13.360 --> 08:18.760
Right, my comprehensive review being a little high-brow for some,

08:18.760 --> 08:22.040
my childish colleague would now have me put the Alfa sideways

08:22.040 --> 08:24.720
through a hole in a wall.

08:25.680 --> 08:28.320
OK, come on, Giulia.

08:28.320 --> 08:29.840
We've made a boast.

08:29.840 --> 08:32.679
I know you weren't involved, but I've made a boast to Mr Reid.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.640
You've got to help me out now. Don't let me down.

08:35.640 --> 08:39.000
And frangible, it turns out, has nothing to do with almonds.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.600
It means fragile.

08:40.600 --> 08:43.640
Apparently.

08:43.640 --> 08:46.520
This feels very, very wrong.

08:47.640 --> 08:49.920
Rory, why are you in an umpire's chair

08:49.920 --> 08:52.120
Please don't question the umpire, Chris.

08:52.120 --> 08:55.240
- You're so childish.
- Bring on the wall!

09:09.080 --> 09:11.040
There is no way on earth he's going to do this.

09:13.120 --> 09:17.760
Everything in my brain is saying, "Don't drive at the big grey wall."

09:25.560 --> 09:31.040
That wasn't good. Big damage to the car, big damage to the car.

09:31.040 --> 09:33.800
So, not that frangible.

09:35.240 --> 09:37.640
I thought you said you could drift this anywhere.

09:37.640 --> 09:39.560
You seen the windscreen?

09:39.560 --> 09:42.320
That went really well!

09:42.320 --> 09:43.680
(God!)

09:45.440 --> 09:47.440
What do you think went wrong, mate?

09:49.240 --> 09:51.400
What a mess!

09:51.400 --> 09:53.520
Disaster!

09:53.520 --> 09:56.040
- I want to do it again.
- You want to do it again?
- Yeah.

09:56.040 --> 09:58.000
Set it up. I'm not giving up.

10:01.480 --> 10:06.200
'Honestly, I was feeling about as wounded as the poor Giulia.'

10:12.160 --> 10:14.320
I've got to get this right. I can do this. We can do this!

10:14.320 --> 10:18.960
'So, with the wall rebuilt, Chris lined up for another attempt.'

10:18.960 --> 10:20.840
Come on! Come on, Giulia!

10:20.840 --> 10:22.720
Bring on the wall!

10:22.720 --> 10:24.800
Already, stop saying that.

10:26.440 --> 10:29.400
This is going to go so horribly wrong.

10:32.960 --> 10:36.600
'And this time, he would try a slightly different line.'

10:44.320 --> 10:46.880
No, that's not worked, either.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.880
Yeah.

10:51.240 --> 10:54.360
Mate, you went through the wall,

10:54.360 --> 10:57.520
just not quite in the shape of the Giulia.

10:57.520 --> 11:01.520
- Do you understand the concept we're working towards here?
- Set it up.

11:01.520 --> 11:04.480
- I'm not giving up.
- I think the car can do it.

11:04.480 --> 11:08.040
'OK, Harris was running out of time,

11:08.040 --> 11:11.960
'but somehow still confident he could do it before the day was out.'

11:11.960 --> 11:14.680
- Bring on the wall!
- Shut up, Rory!

11:14.680 --> 11:18.560
'My tenacious colleague set off to make it third time lucky.'

11:18.560 --> 11:20.760
Drift the car through the wall.

11:22.560 --> 11:23.920
'Then again...'

11:30.040 --> 11:32.800
I accept, as Chris Harris, that my statement

11:32.800 --> 11:36.960
that I could drift it through anything was, on reflection, unwise.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.040
I want to do one more.

11:43.560 --> 11:45.880
As much as I want to see him fail,

11:45.880 --> 11:48.680
there's a small part of me that wants him to succeed.

11:49.760 --> 11:56.360
'And so day became night and with supplies of frangible wall

11:56.360 --> 12:02.880
'now critically low, Chris settled himself for one final attempt.'

12:02.880 --> 12:05.800
I just want to get this done. I want to succeed.

12:05.800 --> 12:07.840
'Oh, just one more thing.'

12:07.840 --> 12:11.680
Bring on the wall!

12:11.680 --> 12:13.320
Here we go, then.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.560
Come on, Chris.

12:18.560 --> 12:21.080
Come on!

12:21.080 --> 12:24.600
Is this really going to work? I can't even see what I'm doing here.

12:25.680 --> 12:28.120
I think you can do this. Come on, mate.

12:33.400 --> 12:35.800
- Whoa-hoa-hoa!
- YES!

12:35.800 --> 12:40.840
Whoa-hoa-hoa-hoa! YEAH!

12:50.400 --> 12:52.800
Yes, baby!

12:52.800 --> 12:55.680
Oh, my God! I can't believe we did it!

12:55.680 --> 12:58.520
I always knew you could do it. I always knew you could do it.

13:00.400 --> 13:03.920
Oh, yes! Celebratory doughnuts!

13:17.240 --> 13:21.960
- Nailed it! Shame about the windscreen, though.
- Yeah, I know.

13:21.960 --> 13:25.160
Look, no-one felt worse about damaging the Alfa than me.

13:25.160 --> 13:27.400
- But, look, I fixed it.
- You did, yeah, I see that.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.360
I also see that you moved the steering wheel

13:29.360 --> 13:30.640
to the other side of the car.

13:30.640 --> 13:32.800
Oh, yeah, you noticed that. I'm sorry.

13:32.800 --> 13:35.080
And, Rory, didn't you just steal that wall idea

13:35.080 --> 13:37.320
from that BMW ad a few years ago?

13:37.320 --> 13:40.560
You know that that was all CGI in that ad, right?

13:40.560 --> 13:41.840
No.

13:41.840 --> 13:43.040
You could have killed Chris!

13:43.040 --> 13:46.200
You can't just jump to the front of the queue like that.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.720
- Oi!
- Hey, I'm kidding.

13:48.720 --> 13:51.760
Now it's time to put the Giulia around our test track...

13:51.760 --> 13:53.440
and you know what that means.

13:53.440 --> 13:56.440
It's The Stig!

13:56.440 --> 13:59.880
Here we go, then, off the line, a bit of launch control.

13:59.880 --> 14:03.920
This is so powerful, this car - over 500hp, carbon fibre bodywork.

14:03.920 --> 14:06.840
Stig getting very lively into the first turn, there.

14:06.840 --> 14:09.640
The little straight down to Chicago really is...

14:09.640 --> 14:12.360
Look, he's managing the throttle there, oversteer everywhere,

14:12.360 --> 14:15.360
using the systems. They'd have been on in race mode here now.

14:15.360 --> 14:17.320
Through Chicago, bit of understeer.

14:17.320 --> 14:19.120
Gets on the gas, neutralises it.

14:19.120 --> 14:21.240
Look at the back end now.

14:21.240 --> 14:24.120
Well controlled by our white-suited friend.

14:25.760 --> 14:27.760
Into the braking zone, into Hammerhead.

14:27.760 --> 14:31.120
Again, look at those brake rotors glowing red hot, carbon ceramics.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.920
Round Hammerhead again.

14:32.920 --> 14:35.720
He starts with understeer then he neutralises it with the gas.

14:35.720 --> 14:37.360
It starts to suggest oversteer.

14:37.360 --> 14:40.240
Now, the long straight back down towards the Follow Through.

14:40.240 --> 14:44.920
That's quick through there. Follow Through... Oh, that was fast.

14:44.920 --> 14:46.600
All the way down, now, to Second-to-Last.

14:46.600 --> 14:49.720
Look at the front brake rotor glowing.

14:49.720 --> 14:52.520
There it is. Look at that, red hot, even on a nice sunny day.

14:52.520 --> 14:56.400
Now through Second-to-Last... Oh, oversteer, that's just showboating.

14:56.400 --> 14:59.160
And Gambon... and over the line.

15:01.840 --> 15:06.240
So, the fastest four-door ever to lap our track I believe

15:06.240 --> 15:10.080
was the Mitsubishi Evo VIII, at 1:24.8.

15:10.080 --> 15:14.000
- So...
- We have a new fastest saloon car.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.160
- Ooh.
- Cos the Alfa did it in...

15:16.160 --> 15:18.120
1:21.4.

15:18.120 --> 15:20.000
- Ooh.
- Nice, very nice.

15:24.560 --> 15:27.000
Not only that, same day, same conditions,

15:27.000 --> 15:29.520
we lapped the new M3...

15:29.520 --> 15:31.920
and it was slower, two tenths slower.

15:31.920 --> 15:34.760
So the Alfa is officially faster than an M3!

15:34.760 --> 15:36.800
- That's great news for them.
- That is...

15:38.200 --> 15:40.800
- Well done, Alfa.
- That's the benchmark, right?

15:40.800 --> 15:42.440
Wow. There you have it.

15:43.800 --> 15:45.320
Great stuff.

15:45.320 --> 15:49.520
The European exotica doesn't end there, because we are now

15:49.520 --> 15:53.800
a week closer to me driving the new Renault Twingo!

15:53.800 --> 15:56.360
Yeah.

15:56.360 --> 15:57.520
Can't wait for that(!)

15:59.240 --> 16:01.360
But now, it's time to welcome this week's guest.

16:01.360 --> 16:02.520
He stars in Broadchurch

16:02.520 --> 16:04.960
and was once voted the planet's greenest celebrity -

16:04.960 --> 16:07.360
this should be interesting.

16:07.360 --> 16:09.280
Please welcome - David Tennant!

16:17.000 --> 16:19.400
- Hello!
- Hey!

16:19.400 --> 16:22.080
- Welcome, welcome.
- Nice to be here.
- Have a seat.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.520
All right. David, thanks for joining us.

16:31.520 --> 16:34.200
- Pleasure, nice place you got here.
- Thanks. Thank you.

16:34.200 --> 16:37.920
Now, how did you become the planet's greenest celebrity?

16:37.920 --> 16:39.080
Tell us about that.

16:39.080 --> 16:41.560
I have absolutely no idea.

16:42.960 --> 16:46.760
The only reason I can fathom is that I drive a Prius.

16:46.760 --> 16:48.120
That seems to be it.

16:48.120 --> 16:50.680
But now, because I have too many children,

16:50.680 --> 16:52.840
we had to get, like, a big, old van as well.

16:52.840 --> 16:56.160
So I now have a Mercedes Viano to get everyone in the back,

16:56.160 --> 16:58.560
and that's a big diesel-guzzling monster,

16:58.560 --> 17:01.480
so I think I've lost any prizes that I ever won.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.160
But you got rid of the Prius?

17:03.160 --> 17:05.359
- We've still got the Prius as well.
- MATT SIGHS

17:05.359 --> 17:06.680
What's wrong with a Prius?!

17:07.880 --> 17:09.079
Look, I'm on David's side.

17:09.079 --> 17:11.480
Everybody is always saying the Prius is this horrible car,

17:11.480 --> 17:14.200
it's disgusting to drive, but I think it deserves

17:14.200 --> 17:15.800
a little bit of respect, OK?

17:15.800 --> 17:20.000
Because it represents the biggest evolutionary step in the history

17:20.000 --> 17:21.839
of the automotive industry, OK?

17:21.839 --> 17:26.839
- What?!
- Without the Prius we wouldn't have the LaFerrari,

17:26.839 --> 17:29.480
- the P1...
- Oh, come on.
- ..or the Porsche 918.

17:29.480 --> 17:32.160
It's time to show the Prius respect. Who likes the Prius?

17:35.920 --> 17:39.000
- Thank you(!) OK, great...
- The silence is deafening.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.440
The single greatest step in automotive technology?

17:41.440 --> 17:43.600
The disc brake? The seat belt?

17:43.600 --> 17:44.920
Enough of that.

17:44.920 --> 17:49.000
And in honour of the world's greenest celebrity...

17:49.000 --> 17:51.240
- Thanks!
- FORMER greenest celebrity.
- Yeah.

17:51.240 --> 17:54.280
..we've filled the studio with a selection of sustainable stuff.

17:54.280 --> 17:55.720
Take a look at this.

17:55.720 --> 17:58.040
It's the Jaguar I-Pace. Look at this.

17:58.040 --> 18:02.480
It's an SUV, but it's Jaguar's answer to the Tesla Model X.

18:02.480 --> 18:04.800
It wasn't so long ago that the Jag brand image

18:04.800 --> 18:07.320
was a little bit Prescott, shall we say,

18:07.320 --> 18:09.480
but this thing is more Silicon Valley.

18:09.480 --> 18:10.800
Forget the Prius, David,

18:10.800 --> 18:13.160
this is the electric family car that you want.

18:13.160 --> 18:15.600
Are you going to give me one? Is that my prize?

18:16.640 --> 18:18.640
There's one problem, though, Rory, isn't there?

18:18.640 --> 18:20.320
- It's not real.
- Of course it's real.

18:20.320 --> 18:23.200
OK, it's not real YET, but it will be ready for production

18:23.200 --> 18:27.120
by the end of the year and it will probably cost about 60 grand.

18:27.120 --> 18:28.360
Guaranteed hit.

18:28.360 --> 18:30.560
Why are you so resistant to the idea of electric cars?

18:30.560 --> 18:31.960
Well, I'm not resistant.

18:31.960 --> 18:34.520
"Because it's all about putting a nozzle in a hole

18:34.520 --> 18:35.760
"and filling it up!"

18:35.760 --> 18:37.720
Matt, I've got something amazing for you.

18:37.720 --> 18:41.840
It comes from Mercedes, it's called the Maybach G650 Landaulet.

18:41.840 --> 18:43.960
And here it is, check this thing out.

18:45.320 --> 18:48.280
- Ooh.
- Nice, huh?
- That is revolting.

18:50.120 --> 18:54.080
It's not revolting, it's decadent! According to Mercedes...

18:54.080 --> 18:56.000
Decadent? For Lego.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.080
They say it demonstrates...

19:01.080 --> 19:05.880
"That the definition of unique luxury can be taken to a new level."

19:05.880 --> 19:08.440
Yeah, they're not wrong, Rory(!)

19:08.440 --> 19:11.680
It's got a massive V12 engine, massive ground clearance,

19:11.680 --> 19:13.680
two thrones in the back.

19:13.680 --> 19:18.920
It's an off-roader that's also a limo that's also a convertible -

19:18.920 --> 19:21.040
what box is that not ticking?

19:21.040 --> 19:24.320
The one that reads "The buyer is of sound mind".

19:26.160 --> 19:30.920
It looks like a Suzuki Vitara slammed into...

19:30.920 --> 19:33.240
Mr T's jewellery box.

19:35.240 --> 19:38.440
You're saying that like it's a bad thing.

19:38.440 --> 19:41.280
- Now, you've been around our track before back in the days...
- Yes.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.840
- ..of the humble Lacetti.
- Yes.

19:43.840 --> 19:45.200
But this time you're taking on

19:45.200 --> 19:48.600
- the fearsome, fire-breathing Toyota GT 86.
- Yeah.

19:48.600 --> 19:51.080
You had some fun training with Chris Harris, what was he like?

19:52.960 --> 19:55.480
- I mean, to be fair...

19:55.480 --> 19:57.720
I think driving lessons do bring out

19:57.720 --> 20:00.840
the worst in people. It's a strangely stress-making time.

20:00.840 --> 20:03.760
- Didn't you once play a driving instructor?
- I did, yes.

20:03.760 --> 20:05.320
I assume you researched the part.

20:05.320 --> 20:08.000
What did you learn about your average driving instructor?

20:08.000 --> 20:10.080
I think it's quite a miserable life.

20:11.200 --> 20:15.480
They do a very difficult job for relatively low remuneration.

20:15.480 --> 20:16.960
- So they're miserable?
- Yeah.

20:16.960 --> 20:19.000
That's like our guy, here!

20:19.000 --> 20:21.880
- All right, let's see how you did.
- Yeah.
- Let's take a look.

20:23.160 --> 20:26.440
As a Doctor Who fan, I'm looking for a bit more

20:26.440 --> 20:28.640
Tom Baker than Peter Davison here, OK?

20:28.640 --> 20:30.080
Don't diss the Davison.

20:31.640 --> 20:33.080
First gear, please.

20:33.080 --> 20:34.320
- OK.
- Go.

20:37.760 --> 20:40.560
- Third gear, third gear!
- Third gear!
- Brake, brake!

20:42.680 --> 20:45.160
- Woohoo!
- Left, we're going to make it!

20:46.800 --> 20:48.120
Waaa!

20:49.400 --> 20:51.360
Flat out, flat out, come on!

20:51.360 --> 20:54.000
It's flat out, what do you want?

20:54.000 --> 20:57.200
- Second gear.
- Second gear? Oh, now you tell me.

20:57.200 --> 21:00.280
Put your hands on the wheel, what are you doing?

21:01.640 --> 21:04.520
- Through here. I don't like this at all.
- It's nippy!

21:05.800 --> 21:08.800
That was nearly death.

21:14.680 --> 21:16.280
Having fun yet?

21:16.280 --> 21:17.920
Over there... No. Over here.

21:19.120 --> 21:21.240
Now, we've got to find our route between the grass

21:21.240 --> 21:23.560
and the white thing. I'm just going to close my eyes.

21:23.560 --> 21:24.680
Woo-hoo-hoo!

21:29.520 --> 21:31.000
OK, up to the right-hand side.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.400
Good, good, good.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.600
Brake at the hundred, brake at the hundred.

21:34.600 --> 21:36.760
- Brake hard, brake hard!
- Braking, braking.

21:36.760 --> 21:39.160
- Braking, sir, braking.
- Brake, brake, brake - or we're off!

21:39.160 --> 21:41.080
Brake or we're off.

21:41.080 --> 21:43.520
- Beautiful.
- SO nearly.
- Come on, that was wonderful, wasn't it?

21:43.520 --> 21:45.840
- Second gear, second gear.
- Oh,
- BLEEP.

21:45.840 --> 21:48.720
You nearly-killing-me horrible person, you.

21:48.720 --> 21:50.240
Hoo-hoo!

21:50.240 --> 21:52.320
God, stop, stop.

21:53.720 --> 21:54.840
Did you enjoy that?

21:56.040 --> 21:57.400
I had a great time.

22:02.240 --> 22:04.760
- How was it?
- Loved it.

22:06.360 --> 22:09.200
I think you have got to start being nicer to the guests.

22:09.200 --> 22:11.840
I'll try, as long as they don't scare me so much.

22:11.840 --> 22:14.560
- You've got to chill out a bit, I had a great time.
- I'm sure you did.

22:14.560 --> 22:17.440
- He didn't look scared.
- No.
- He looked fine.

22:17.440 --> 22:18.600
Why were you so scared?

22:18.600 --> 22:22.080
Because it felt like he was trying to hurt me and the car.

22:22.080 --> 22:26.520
OK, I would like to tell you about a new performance hybrid from Japan.

22:26.520 --> 22:30.320
- The NSX?
- No, way better than the Honda NSX.

22:30.320 --> 22:31.600
It's this.

22:31.600 --> 22:37.440
The Komatsu HB365LC-3.

22:37.440 --> 22:39.400
Yeah, Matt, that's a digger.

22:41.360 --> 22:44.280
No, no, no, that is not a digger, OK?

22:45.360 --> 22:50.800
That's a tracked excavator. Diggers do this, yeah?

22:50.800 --> 22:53.000
Excavators do this.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.080
And dozers do this.

22:55.080 --> 22:57.440
Anyway, look, this thing is awesome.

22:57.440 --> 23:01.120
36 tonnes, 340 horsepower, it's got a diesel electric hybrid

23:01.120 --> 23:04.120
for a power plant and it is just...

23:04.120 --> 23:07.080
You really, genuinely care about this stuff, don't you?

23:08.840 --> 23:11.320
Of course I do, don't you?

23:11.320 --> 23:14.240
David, back me up, you look like a tracked excavator fan?

23:16.320 --> 23:19.520
I'm not entirely sure...

23:21.080 --> 23:26.400
..what this is telling us... about your fascinations, Matt.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.200
I can be a little grabby.

23:29.800 --> 23:32.560
Another treat for the world's greenest celebrity.

23:32.560 --> 23:37.040
A new all-electric supercar. Comes from Croatia, the Rimac.

23:37.040 --> 23:42.920
It's in our studio. It looks brilliant, and it's fast. 221 mph.

23:42.920 --> 23:46.400
There's a motor in each of the wheels so it's four-wheel drive.

23:46.400 --> 23:49.280
It will do 200 miles per charge AND

23:49.280 --> 23:51.680
beat a Bugatti Veyron in a drag race.

23:51.680 --> 23:55.640
- How cool is that?
- What is this big fascination with electric cars?

23:55.640 --> 23:57.760
Did you lick batteries as a kid?

24:00.320 --> 24:02.520
- Did you?
- The little nine volt ones, yeah.

24:02.520 --> 24:04.760
- Yeah, a little tingle.
- Get a little tingle.

24:04.760 --> 24:06.520
- You're not supposed to do that.
- No?
- No!

24:06.520 --> 24:09.240
- That explains a lot.
- It does!

24:09.240 --> 24:11.200
Have you noticed, Rory, every week

24:11.200 --> 24:13.440
there's a new electric super hyper car,

24:13.440 --> 24:15.600
and one that promises it will beat a Bugatti Veyron

24:15.600 --> 24:18.440
- in a straight line?
- That's because they CAN beat Veyrons.

24:18.440 --> 24:20.240
That's the whole point of electric cars.

24:20.240 --> 24:23.200
- What did you say it was called again?
- Rimac.
- Rimac?

24:24.720 --> 24:27.880
Sounds like something you use to remove hair.

24:27.880 --> 24:29.880
From where?

24:29.880 --> 24:31.960
From your... rim. I don't know.

24:34.480 --> 24:36.800
I think it's time to move on at that point.

24:36.800 --> 24:39.440
Fair enough. Come on, Chris.

24:39.440 --> 24:41.720
Your classic convertible supercar -

24:41.720 --> 24:44.000
theatrical, flamboyant,

24:44.000 --> 24:47.320
and according to our producers, pointless.

24:47.320 --> 24:50.040
Great for the two days of the summer when it's warm and dry,

24:50.040 --> 24:54.120
utterly useless for the rest of the icy, wet, cold year.

24:54.120 --> 24:56.160
We said, "Get with the times."

24:56.160 --> 24:58.720
Yes, roofless supercars were once like that,

24:58.720 --> 25:02.040
but the modern breed, you can really use them all year round.

25:02.040 --> 25:04.200
So the producers said, "Prove it."

25:04.200 --> 25:06.640
Matt and I were each told to pick a four-wheel drive

25:06.640 --> 25:10.760
convertible supercar and to report bright and early Monday morning

25:10.760 --> 25:12.560
for a series of tests in...

25:12.560 --> 25:13.640
Las Vegas.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.080
All right, all right, I'm coming.

25:45.080 --> 25:47.880
That's... That wasn't me.

25:55.480 --> 25:57.760
Hey. Ooh, breakfast, nice.

25:59.560 --> 26:01.360
Oh, not breakfast.

26:01.360 --> 26:03.960
Can I... order breakfast? No?

26:05.280 --> 26:08.480
"Welcome to the Four Seasons Supercar Challenge.

26:08.480 --> 26:13.120
"You will now drive from Las Vegas to the snowy Sierra Nevada mountains

26:13.120 --> 26:17.320
"encountering spring, summer, autumn and winter on your way.

26:17.320 --> 26:19.880
"PS - you're late, get a move on." Ooh.

26:19.880 --> 26:21.880
Yo, Harris, get up, we've got to go!

26:25.400 --> 26:30.440
Our four season cars were waiting downstairs, and my ace card?

26:30.440 --> 26:36.760
The Lamborghini Huracan Spyder - 5.2 litre V10, 610 horsepower,

26:36.760 --> 26:39.840
all lurking under a body of pure Italian flamboyance.

26:41.640 --> 26:45.480
I put my chips on the Porsche 911 Turbo S.

26:45.480 --> 26:48.520
It might only have a 3.8 litre flat-6,

26:48.520 --> 26:52.720
but trust me, in the real world, this is the fastest car you can buy.

26:55.840 --> 26:58.560
Ooh. Whoa, hang on.

26:58.560 --> 27:02.120
This is the supercar challenge, did you not hear the rules?

27:02.120 --> 27:03.760
Bring a supercar.

27:03.760 --> 27:07.040
0-60 in under three seconds, top speed over 200mph -

27:07.040 --> 27:09.880
what's not super about that?

27:09.880 --> 27:11.800
Yeah, but it's a 911.

27:11.800 --> 27:14.840
It's got rear seats, it's a sports car.

27:14.840 --> 27:18.520
Don't get me wrong, I love 911s, it's a super car...

27:18.520 --> 27:20.680
but it's not a SUPERCAR.

27:20.680 --> 27:23.720
Coming from the man that's chosen the lifestyle Lamborghini?

27:23.720 --> 27:26.360
What'd you mean? "Lifestyle", what does that mean?

27:26.360 --> 27:28.280
In other words, that's the car for the driver

27:28.280 --> 27:30.640
that doesn't like driving, it's all about image.

27:30.640 --> 27:32.880
No. No, no, no, no, no.

27:32.880 --> 27:34.320
Look at it.

27:34.320 --> 27:38.160
They said don't bring a blue car and don't wear a blue shirt.

27:38.160 --> 27:40.240
So let's go drive them.

27:40.240 --> 27:41.560
Cheater.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.400
What do you mean, "cheater"? It's a supercar.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.560
It's not a supercar, Chris.

27:45.560 --> 27:48.600
Well, this wasn't going to be settled in the car park.

27:51.760 --> 27:53.680
Time to hit the road.

28:07.960 --> 28:10.360
Yeah.

28:10.360 --> 28:16.320
I chose this car because this is a proper supercar.

28:16.320 --> 28:19.920
It's low, it's pointy, it's noisy, it's impractical.

28:22.160 --> 28:25.120
But that's what you want in a supercar,

28:25.120 --> 28:28.000
you want that over-the-top styling,

28:28.000 --> 28:31.400
you want that larger-than-life superhero feel.

28:34.200 --> 28:37.640
Inside that Lamborghini, Matthew will be giving a detailed,

28:37.640 --> 28:40.160
impassioned explanation as to why he's driving a supercar.

28:40.160 --> 28:42.200
I don't need to bother with that.

28:42.200 --> 28:43.560
I can just tell you the following.

28:43.560 --> 28:45.880
This is faster to 60, it uses less fuel,

28:45.880 --> 28:47.640
it's bigger, more practical,

28:47.640 --> 28:50.280
it costs less money, it's all-round better.

28:50.280 --> 28:53.680
AND, best of all, I don't look like a part-time pornographer

28:53.680 --> 28:54.920
when I drive it.

29:02.560 --> 29:05.360
Out of the city limits, we began our epic journey.

29:07.680 --> 29:09.160
From the intense heat

29:09.160 --> 29:11.680
of California's vast desert plains

29:11.680 --> 29:13.880
to the brutal sub-zero snow and ice

29:13.880 --> 29:16.000
of the Sierra Nevada mountains.

29:19.800 --> 29:22.640
Four seasons, 400 miles.

29:22.640 --> 29:25.480
And for this challenge, the Lamborghini really is

29:25.480 --> 29:26.880
in a class of its own.

29:26.880 --> 29:31.440
The Huracan is the last of the naturally aspirated supercars.

29:31.440 --> 29:34.360
The McLaren 650S - turbo-charged.

29:34.360 --> 29:37.840
Ferrari 488 - turbo-charged.

29:37.840 --> 29:42.400
The 911 Turbo, um... turbo-charged.

29:44.400 --> 29:45.840
This is a dying breed.

29:47.520 --> 29:50.600
And that's because, these days, Turbo is the way to go.

29:52.200 --> 29:55.360
The 911 has a higher top speed than the Lambo.

29:55.360 --> 29:59.240
And according to Porsche, it's 2.8 second 0-60 is

29:59.240 --> 30:01.800
half a second quicker, too.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.680
But the best bit...

30:03.680 --> 30:06.040
Every time you actually do it - it's faster.

30:06.040 --> 30:10.120
I've done it in 2.6 in this car. It's outrageous!

30:13.320 --> 30:15.000
Sounds so nice.

30:16.360 --> 30:18.160
Supercars are about presence.

30:18.160 --> 30:19.960
They're about that image.

30:19.960 --> 30:21.600
That feeling, you know?

30:23.520 --> 30:27.000
They're about posters on a bedroom wall.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.200
The 911 just doesn't give you that.

30:31.560 --> 30:34.120
The Lamborghini Huracan Spyder,

30:34.120 --> 30:36.200
like walking into a room and shouting,

30:36.200 --> 30:37.920
"HELLO, I'M HERE!"

30:40.080 --> 30:42.720
We were told to report to a local race track

30:42.720 --> 30:45.320
for our first four seasons challenge,

30:45.320 --> 30:47.400
but before we got going, we went out for a few

30:47.400 --> 30:50.040
sighting laps, to really get to know our cars.

30:50.040 --> 30:52.280
Huh, it would have been rude not to.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.560
It cheats physics, this thing.

31:01.560 --> 31:04.160
It shouldn't be able to do what it does.

31:04.160 --> 31:06.160
Cos the engine is in the wrong place,

31:06.160 --> 31:08.440
so it should understeer horribly, but it doesn't.

31:08.440 --> 31:11.480
It has got mega-traction. The engine is an animal,

31:11.480 --> 31:14.680
it just pulls and pulls and pulls from no revs whatsoever.

31:16.280 --> 31:18.400
It's just a fantastic motor vehicle.

31:22.360 --> 31:26.280
Harris calls this "The lifestyle Lambo".

31:26.280 --> 31:28.920
It's not a bad lifestyle, if you ask me!

31:30.760 --> 31:33.240
It does understeer a little bit.

31:33.240 --> 31:37.280
But that's OK. Let's you find the limit without crashing...

31:37.280 --> 31:40.800
and this car is all about the drive train.

31:40.800 --> 31:44.080
The double-clutch gearbox is super-fast.

31:44.080 --> 31:45.760
The motor is just fantastic!

31:47.480 --> 31:50.960
It's a bit faster in a straight line than I expected, Matthew.

31:50.960 --> 31:53.720
Soon though, we were told to pull over.

31:53.720 --> 31:55.560
It was time for our challenge.

31:57.760 --> 32:02.560
"Welcome to Spring Mountain Raceway." See what they did there?

32:02.560 --> 32:06.160
- I do, yes.
- Four seasons.
- Very clever! Clever!

32:06.160 --> 32:09.440
- "Spring is a season of unpredictable weather..."
- Yeah.

32:09.440 --> 32:10.680
I can tell,

32:10.680 --> 32:13.720
- it looks like it's going to rain any minute.
- Mm.

32:13.720 --> 32:19.080
"..When a fast-action roof is essential. Time for a one-lap race.

32:19.080 --> 32:20.920
"You must start with your roof down

32:20.920 --> 32:23.360
"and finish with your roof up.

32:23.360 --> 32:25.160
"First to cross the line wins."

32:26.640 --> 32:28.680
OK.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.720
Two supercars.

32:30.720 --> 32:35.120
Well, one supercar. One lap of the track.

32:35.120 --> 32:39.040
First one past the chequered flag with their roof up - wins.

32:40.880 --> 32:44.040
OK! Thrust mode possible. I'm ready.

32:44.040 --> 32:46.760
Are you ready? I'm ready!

32:46.760 --> 32:49.200
This car is violent off the line.

32:50.920 --> 32:54.360
Going to get my roof down towards the end of the race.

32:54.360 --> 32:57.760
I bet that's what he'll do. OK, here we go!

32:57.760 --> 33:00.600
Three, two, one... Go!

33:03.360 --> 33:06.720
- There he goes!
- Oh!

33:06.720 --> 33:09.200
She comes out of the hole good!

33:11.960 --> 33:15.480
An impressive start, but I had a different plan.

33:15.480 --> 33:17.480
Launch control... Go!

33:19.960 --> 33:22.640
That's outrageous! I'm done.

33:22.640 --> 33:25.000
I don't have to worry about this any more.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.600
OK... he's got a different strategy. He's putting

33:27.600 --> 33:29.720
his top up there.

33:31.480 --> 33:34.960
The Lamborghini roof goes up in 17 seconds.

33:34.960 --> 33:38.800
Annoyingly, Harris's Porsche does it in just 13.

33:38.800 --> 33:42.160
I've got to get a little bit of an advantage here, because

33:42.160 --> 33:45.360
he's got a four-second-quicker roof mechanism.

33:47.240 --> 33:49.600
But just as I was building my lead...

33:52.960 --> 33:54.760
..spring sprung!

33:56.360 --> 33:57.880
Oh, what is that?

34:03.200 --> 34:05.040
I can see him.

34:05.040 --> 34:08.280
Roof down, peacocking around!

34:08.280 --> 34:10.080
Oh, there he is.

34:10.080 --> 34:12.679
- Come on, Lambo!
- They've wet the track!

34:19.040 --> 34:20.440
That's so slippery!

34:22.080 --> 34:25.400
There he is! He's still got to put his roof up.

34:27.320 --> 34:30.280
And to do that, Matt had to slow down to

34:30.280 --> 34:32.199
a steady 31.

34:32.199 --> 34:35.199
Come on, baby! Where is it? Where is it?

34:35.199 --> 34:37.400
Not so super now!

34:40.840 --> 34:42.360
Hello, sweetheart!

34:45.520 --> 34:47.040
- Yes!
- He got me!

34:49.159 --> 34:51.000
So, what do we think, then?

34:51.000 --> 34:53.440
Does you being beaten make me a supercar?

34:53.440 --> 34:55.159
Or am I not a supercar?

34:55.159 --> 34:57.800
Well, this is a test of practicality.

34:57.800 --> 35:01.800
So your sports car has a very practical four-seconds-quicker

35:01.800 --> 35:03.200
roof mechanism.

35:03.200 --> 35:06.520
A supercar, which this is, and that is not, is not supposed

35:06.520 --> 35:10.080
to be practical at all. Which this isn't. At all!

35:14.320 --> 35:16.680
This was going to be a long trip!

35:22.760 --> 35:25.600
And as we moved on to the next challenge...

35:25.600 --> 35:28.680
Fantastic out here. This is America, baby!

35:28.680 --> 35:31.760
- Cowboy country!
- It is absolutely stunning!

35:33.280 --> 35:35.960
Even the incredible scenery was bringing out

35:35.960 --> 35:38.200
our competitive streak.

35:38.200 --> 35:41.680
- Big.
- Big and vertiginous!

35:41.680 --> 35:45.040
- Now, there's a word!
- Yes.

35:45.040 --> 35:48.080
You are quite the sesquipedalian!

35:50.040 --> 35:51.720
One hour later, we arrived at our

35:51.720 --> 35:54.960
next challenge location and the signs didn't look good!

35:57.360 --> 36:00.720
Death Valley is one of the hottest places on Earth.

36:00.720 --> 36:02.760
And before we went any further,

36:02.760 --> 36:04.840
Harris insisted on taking supplies.

36:06.200 --> 36:09.320
I'm taking no chances with this Death Valley thing.

36:09.320 --> 36:12.680
I've got water, snacks, a shovel

36:12.680 --> 36:16.560
- and spare radio batteries, should they run out.
- Ah-ha.

36:16.560 --> 36:20.720
For me, to survive this potentially deadly crossing,

36:20.720 --> 36:24.640
I'm teaming a cinnamon latte with a poppy seed blueberry muffin.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.560
Oh, smells so nice!

36:27.560 --> 36:29.280
It's just embarrassing!

36:29.280 --> 36:31.160
Are you sure you don't want a muffin?

36:31.160 --> 36:34.440
I don't need a muffin. I need water and practicality.

36:34.440 --> 36:36.840
What are you going to do with that shovel?

36:36.840 --> 36:38.480
Hey!

36:41.640 --> 36:43.480
Thank you!

36:43.480 --> 36:46.440
Happy trails.

36:46.440 --> 36:49.440
- I'll take that.
- That's a cowboy!

36:49.440 --> 36:51.960
"Welcome to summer. The holiday season.

36:51.960 --> 36:55.040
"Time to take a vacation from your car.

36:55.040 --> 36:57.880
"You will now switch vehicles."

36:57.880 --> 37:01.120
- Did you organise this?
- No.
- "Then drive across Death Valley."

37:01.120 --> 37:03.280
- This is a stitch-up, isn't it?
- OK, yeah.

37:03.280 --> 37:05.640
- I'll take the muffin.
- I'll keep the muffin.

37:05.640 --> 37:08.560
Thanks for stocking my car up with goodies!

37:10.800 --> 37:13.440
- Hey, Chris...
- Yes.

37:14.760 --> 37:16.480
These chips that you bought,

37:16.480 --> 37:18.720
they are delicious! Thank you.

37:18.720 --> 37:20.840
Leave those alone!

37:23.600 --> 37:25.040
Tasty snacks aside, though,

37:25.040 --> 37:28.880
life in Harris's Porsche was definitely not as special.

37:28.880 --> 37:31.040
Quite a bit different than the Lambo.

37:31.040 --> 37:33.560
It feels, really, a lot taller.

37:33.560 --> 37:36.880
It feels definitely more practical.

37:36.880 --> 37:39.600
What's it like being in the peacock?

37:39.600 --> 37:41.800
The engine is a masterpiece.

37:41.800 --> 37:46.080
8,500 RPM with a lovely step at about 4.5.

37:47.880 --> 37:49.960
Buffeting, not very good.

37:49.960 --> 37:54.280
I'm a very, very short man, as my co-host is very keen to point out,

37:54.280 --> 37:57.320
and I'm pretty much in the airflow here.

37:57.320 --> 38:00.120
If you were the size of a normal human being,

38:00.120 --> 38:01.280
this wouldn't work!

38:03.640 --> 38:07.040
Now, come on! Tell me the truth...

38:08.080 --> 38:11.720
- You like that car!
- I mean, the sense of theatre, if you

38:11.720 --> 38:14.520
wanted to feel that you'd bought something special

38:14.520 --> 38:18.000
with your money, I have to say, it's more special

38:18.000 --> 38:20.880
than the Porsche. But it's just lacking

38:20.880 --> 38:22.720
ANY kind of sense.

38:22.720 --> 38:24.840
But that's the whole point.

38:24.840 --> 38:28.600
It's not supposed to make sense! It's a supercar.

38:28.600 --> 38:30.240
Here we go again!

38:32.680 --> 38:34.440
Summer was getting us nowhere.

38:34.440 --> 38:36.640
So, for the rest of the challenge,

38:36.640 --> 38:39.560
we agreed to just enjoy the cars and the view.

38:42.160 --> 38:44.520
Look at this! This is special.

38:44.520 --> 38:46.720
That is some epic scenery right there.

38:47.800 --> 38:50.760
And reaching the foot of the Sierra Nevada, it was time

38:50.760 --> 38:52.560
to deliver our verdicts.

38:54.640 --> 38:57.480
So, what do you think? Huh?

38:57.480 --> 39:00.040
- Well, I think...
- This is your last bottle of water, by the way.

39:00.040 --> 39:03.120
What? Look, if you are a dental hygienist from Florida,

39:03.120 --> 39:05.000
or you keep a Chihuahua,

39:05.000 --> 39:08.520
- or you take selfies, I think it is a great car. Great, Matt.
- OK.

39:08.520 --> 39:12.480
What about my car? Come on, tell me about my car?

39:12.480 --> 39:15.920
Well, that is a nice car. I mean, if you are in the market

39:15.920 --> 39:19.120
for a supercar that is the most bland supercar

39:19.120 --> 39:20.640
you can find - that is it.

39:20.640 --> 39:23.320
I'm telling you, that is a bland supercar.

39:23.320 --> 39:26.760
That's a meaningful 50-year marriage.

39:26.760 --> 39:28.720
That's a one-night stand!

39:35.360 --> 39:38.120
We called summer a no-score draw.

39:38.120 --> 39:40.800
And after a long day, the producers had kindly laid on

39:40.800 --> 39:43.520
accommodation in a quaint local village.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.120
Wow, look at this place!

40:04.720 --> 40:07.680
Ever had the feeling you were being watched?

40:09.440 --> 40:10.680
To help us blend in...

40:12.160 --> 40:13.880
..I had a plan!

40:13.880 --> 40:15.360
OK, follow my lead!

40:18.080 --> 40:19.840
Oh, yeah, that should do it,

40:19.840 --> 40:23.760
erecting the roof will cover all bases in this situation.

40:23.760 --> 40:25.240
Just put your roof up!

40:29.080 --> 40:32.480
I just erected four seconds faster than you!

40:32.480 --> 40:34.320
'Stop saying erect!'

40:34.320 --> 40:37.800
This is the last place you want to get caught with an erection!

40:49.080 --> 40:51.040
OK, now, what you need

40:51.040 --> 40:53.320
to know about that film - is that when I got my Lambo

40:53.320 --> 40:56.120
back from Harris, it was disgusting!

40:57.400 --> 41:00.040
OK! Crumbs on the seats. Chocolate on the wheel.

41:00.040 --> 41:03.680
I am pretty sure you got hummus on the rev needle.

41:03.680 --> 41:06.280
I don't even know how you did that. OK,

41:06.280 --> 41:09.400
- you, my friend, are a pig!
- I'd rather be fast than clean.

41:09.400 --> 41:12.400
You know, you can be both, right? I think it says something about the

41:12.400 --> 41:16.320
- kind of person you are.
- Work with me, are you a car slob, like me?

41:16.320 --> 41:19.800
Personally, I am not. But I have four kids.

41:19.800 --> 41:24.320
So, my car has a thin layer of raisins and snot at all times.

41:24.320 --> 41:27.240
It's sort of impossible to... manage with anything else.

41:27.240 --> 41:29.440
But you, yourself, are quite clean within the car?

41:29.440 --> 41:31.120
I would like to be, but I have given up

41:31.120 --> 41:35.240
until my children reach, you know, 46, I'm just going to accept

41:35.240 --> 41:38.040
that that is how we're going to live.

41:38.040 --> 41:40.240
I can be dirty, as well, in the car. But unlike you,

41:40.240 --> 41:42.760
I keep the outside of the car pristine.

41:42.760 --> 41:45.920
You have a different attitude towards that, I gather.

41:45.920 --> 41:47.840
Well, I just... You know...

41:47.840 --> 41:49.880
Especially driving around in London,

41:49.880 --> 41:51.640
the odd scrape, the odd scratch -

41:51.640 --> 41:54.120
anything that doesn't disable the vehicle...

41:55.360 --> 41:57.600
..I don't think is worth worrying about.

41:57.600 --> 42:00.320
What constitutes a scrape or a scrunch?

42:00.320 --> 42:02.480
Well, there's certainly

42:02.480 --> 42:04.560
a panel, that if you drive too fast,

42:04.560 --> 42:06.480
flaps out the black.

42:06.480 --> 42:08.320
But you can kick it back in

42:08.320 --> 42:10.360
and it does for about a week each time.

42:10.360 --> 42:12.840
Are you the kind of person, that when you parallel park

42:12.840 --> 42:14.800
you kind of nudge the car in front a little?

42:14.800 --> 42:17.600
I don't nudge... I am very beady about other

42:17.600 --> 42:21.480
people's cars. But if you are in a multistorey and...

42:21.480 --> 42:24.680
you rub against a wall to sneak into that little tight space,

42:24.680 --> 42:26.920
- what's the harm?
- There's a voice inside him now...

42:26.920 --> 42:30.640
- Just a bit of paint...
- ..that's crying and screaming about this, he simply can't...

42:30.640 --> 42:33.000
- I can't take it.
- The thought of damaging something!

42:33.000 --> 42:35.400
All right, moving on, now you are back on our screens

42:35.400 --> 42:36.960
for a new series of Broadchurch.

42:36.960 --> 42:38.440
The final. This is it.

42:38.440 --> 42:41.640
I think we should do three and then leave them

42:41.640 --> 42:44.000
wanting more. It's a small town, if there was revolving door

42:44.000 --> 42:47.960
of horrendous crimes happening, it would start to get a bit preposterous, so...

42:47.960 --> 42:50.400
The writers, I hear they are super, super secretive

42:50.400 --> 42:52.120
about the storylines. Is that true?

42:52.120 --> 42:54.760
Yeah. It's always been... the way.

42:54.760 --> 42:57.120
Anything that is a thriller that has...

42:57.120 --> 42:58.880
elements of plot that you want to hold back,

42:58.880 --> 43:00.920
I think everyone gets it, particularly

43:00.920 --> 43:03.360
in this modern era, the idea that someone

43:03.360 --> 43:06.560
could misplace an e-mail, or that the Kremlin

43:06.560 --> 43:09.560
could hack into your account.... You know...

43:11.480 --> 43:14.200
It means being on the show gets really tiresome.

43:14.200 --> 43:16.440
Because everything gets sent out with a password.

43:16.440 --> 43:19.320
One script has one password, another has a different password.

43:19.320 --> 43:22.240
And then the script amendments, that come through the night before

43:22.240 --> 43:23.960
and they are not passwords you choose.

43:23.960 --> 43:27.000
They give you a password and that is in a different e-mail, that has a

43:27.000 --> 43:29.280
different password that you have to remember from

43:29.280 --> 43:31.640
last week... when they sent out... I just can't keep up.

43:31.640 --> 43:34.320
- It is just impossible.
- If you don't know your lines, you can

43:34.320 --> 43:37.160
- just say, "I didn't get the e-mail..."
- Exactly.
- Beautiful!

43:37.160 --> 43:39.600
I end up being a terrible grumpy old man about it -

43:39.600 --> 43:41.680
and phoning up - "Just send me some paper.

43:41.680 --> 43:43.320
"I can't deal with this!"

43:43.320 --> 43:45.760
All right, are we ready? Because the time has come...

43:45.760 --> 43:49.120
- Is this it?
- ..to see how you did around the track,

43:49.120 --> 43:50.600
on your own, in the GT86

43:50.600 --> 43:54.000
I'm very optimistic. I fear crashing disappointment.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.400
- Before we do, there is something we need to discuss, I think.
- Yeah.

43:57.400 --> 43:59.960
- After I left you at the end of our coaching session...
- Yeah.

43:59.960 --> 44:03.000
..you agreed you'd then go off and do

44:03.000 --> 44:05.800
your timed laps. But between those two events, I gather you went for

44:05.800 --> 44:07.640
a little bit of extra training on your own.

44:07.640 --> 44:10.920
- A bit of a sneaky extra training lap...?
- Well...!

44:10.920 --> 44:13.960
What happened?

44:13.960 --> 44:17.160
I... I just... I kind of think you've got to go for it.

44:17.160 --> 44:19.600
You've got to learn what the car can take.

44:19.600 --> 44:21.240
You've got to push your boundaries.

44:21.240 --> 44:24.600
And sometimes you slightly overstep your boundaries.

44:24.600 --> 44:26.880
Can we see the image, please?

44:26.880 --> 44:29.080
Oh, no!

44:29.080 --> 44:31.720
Anything that doesn't disable the vehicle...

44:33.280 --> 44:35.360
..doesn't count as an accident!

44:38.040 --> 44:40.440
We've only had that car two weeks.

44:40.440 --> 44:42.200
And now it's got character!

44:43.240 --> 44:45.240
What did you hit? There is NOTHING out there!

44:45.240 --> 44:47.600
It was one of those sort of foam signs

44:47.600 --> 44:49.360
that tell you when to turn left.

44:49.360 --> 44:52.560
Oh, now I can talk to you about foam that damages cars.

44:52.560 --> 44:55.000
- It really can. I can sympathise there.
- Yeah, you see? You see?

44:55.000 --> 44:56.200
- I can sympathise.
- Yeah, yeah.

44:56.200 --> 44:59.120
- OK, but you did manage to record a timed lap, yeah?
- Yeah.

44:59.120 --> 45:02.160
- Oh, yeah, that was in training.
- OK.

45:02.160 --> 45:04.680
- Well, let's take a look at that then.
- Let's have a look.

45:04.680 --> 45:08.280
- Here we go, off the line.
- Oh, poor.
- Average at best.
- Ugh!

45:08.280 --> 45:09.400
Look at the massive dent!

45:09.400 --> 45:11.640
Come on! Come on! Oh, that was nasty.

45:11.640 --> 45:14.360
Oh, you look very serious.

45:14.360 --> 45:16.160
We're flying, we're flying.

45:16.160 --> 45:19.080
A really good view of the damage caused to the panel again.

45:19.080 --> 45:20.600
Lovely, isn't it? Looking good.

45:20.600 --> 45:22.760
The line's not too bad.

45:22.760 --> 45:24.400
We're on FIRE!

45:24.400 --> 45:26.000
OK, braking hard into Chicago.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.640
Braked a bit early, I think. What's it like through here?

45:28.640 --> 45:31.800
Bit of understeer, and then a massive clog of throttle

45:31.800 --> 45:34.520
- which triggered the ESP and slowed you down.
- Oh, shut up!

45:34.520 --> 45:37.320
And the trick is to use the whole circuit, not half the circuit, OK?

45:37.320 --> 45:39.640
Over to the right-hand side. Here are your braking boards.

45:39.640 --> 45:41.440
- Oh, look, there's one you didn't hit!
- Yeah.

45:41.440 --> 45:43.520
Now we go left, right round Hammerhead.

45:43.520 --> 45:45.400
Let's see your line through Hammerhead.

45:45.400 --> 45:47.200
Not... Ooh, again, triggered the ESP.

45:47.200 --> 45:48.320
Oh, yes!

45:48.320 --> 45:49.920
Here we go.

45:49.920 --> 45:52.160
COME ON! GO FASTER!

45:55.800 --> 45:58.040
Nice! Nice!

45:59.560 --> 46:01.520
And now flat-out through the Follow Through.

46:02.880 --> 46:05.520
If you hadn't had ESP there, you would have died.

46:05.520 --> 46:06.920
Well, I did - it's fine.

46:06.920 --> 46:09.080
Braking hard, braking hard into second to last.

46:09.080 --> 46:10.480
Very good line through there.

46:10.480 --> 46:12.120
Ooh, we did it, we did it, we did it.

46:12.120 --> 46:13.360
Second gear, come on.

46:13.360 --> 46:14.400
Through Gambon...

46:15.520 --> 46:17.520
..and over the line.

46:19.520 --> 46:22.800
All right. That was pretty good. How do you feel? What do you think?

46:22.800 --> 46:24.160
Yeah. You know.

46:24.160 --> 46:26.280
- I think you did all right.
- Thank you.
- I do.

46:26.280 --> 46:27.680
I was feeling quietly confident

46:27.680 --> 46:30.560
- until I heard your barrage of criticism.
- Well, no... I was just...

46:30.560 --> 46:33.320
- You set yourself high standards, I want to help you to get there.
- OK.

46:33.320 --> 46:36.880
And I'm just glad that you didn't apply any more damage to our car.

46:36.880 --> 46:39.520
- One little dent.
- What do you think? How do you think he did?

46:39.520 --> 46:42.080
I think that was quite quick. I think it was daring in places.

46:42.080 --> 46:44.760
He scrubbed off some speed. But I'm-I'm confident.

46:44.760 --> 46:46.440
- I think he's done me proud.
- OK!

46:46.440 --> 46:50.800
Well, the best time on our board is still Max Whitlock,

46:50.800 --> 46:54.680
the Olympic gold medallist, with 1:39.5.

46:54.680 --> 46:56.720
You ever see his flic-flacs?

46:56.720 --> 46:59.600
- So graceful, the extension that guy... Anyway.
- You haven't seen...

46:59.600 --> 47:02.200
- You haven't seen my flic-flacs.
- I have your time right here.

47:02.200 --> 47:05.200
- Yeah?
- David Tennant, you did it...

47:05.200 --> 47:06.920
- Yeah?
- ..in one minute...

47:06.920 --> 47:08.680
Forty...

47:08.680 --> 47:10.560
four, flat.

47:10.560 --> 47:13.280
- Yes!
- Come on!

47:13.280 --> 47:14.440
Huh?

47:15.600 --> 47:17.880
Well done. Really well done.

47:19.600 --> 47:23.120
Second place, I'll take that. I'll take that. Yeah.

47:23.120 --> 47:25.160
- Second quickest.
- Yeah, that's OK.

47:26.480 --> 47:28.680
So I think that's congratulations to both of you.

47:28.680 --> 47:29.880
You had a little help from him.

47:29.880 --> 47:31.800
I couldn't have done it without my teacher.

47:31.800 --> 47:33.600
I think you'd have been first without Chris.

47:35.360 --> 47:38.720
- No, I'm kidding.
- I-I... Yeah, I'll take second place. That's all right.

47:38.720 --> 47:40.960
- That's good, that's good.
- I think that's really good.

47:40.960 --> 47:43.200
- Ladies and gentlemen, David Tennant!
- Thank you!

47:43.200 --> 47:45.960
Nice to see you again.

47:45.960 --> 47:47.360
Thanks for coming.

47:47.360 --> 47:49.360
- Thank you for everything.
- Thank you.

47:50.520 --> 47:53.680
Now, earlier on, Matt and I had finished the first day

47:53.680 --> 47:58.640
of our big convertible supercar trip in the charming town of Darwin.

47:58.640 --> 48:01.640
And because what happens in Darwin stays in Darwin -

48:01.640 --> 48:03.200
really, that's their motto -

48:03.200 --> 48:05.680
we pick up the story the following morning.

48:12.680 --> 48:16.360
'We got up early, as it was time to leave California's desert plains...'

48:16.360 --> 48:18.600
Ooh, I think we might be about to

48:18.600 --> 48:21.520
enter into a bit of twisty, windy road, Mr Harris.

48:23.360 --> 48:26.440
'..and start our climb into the Sierra Nevada Mountains.'

48:28.200 --> 48:30.320
There is no guard rail.

48:30.320 --> 48:32.360
Look at that, that's a sheer face right there.

48:32.360 --> 48:34.280
You go off there, that's bad.

48:36.120 --> 48:39.200
'We wondered what our next challenge might be.'

48:39.200 --> 48:42.360
Ooh, Smokey the Bear up ahead. Smokey the Bear up ahead.

48:43.400 --> 48:45.680
'And with no idea what Matt was on about,

48:45.680 --> 48:49.200
'we came across a policeman waiting with the answer.'

48:49.200 --> 48:51.040
Hello, officer.

48:51.040 --> 48:52.760
Oh.

48:52.760 --> 48:53.960
Well, thank you.

48:55.320 --> 48:58.800
"Welcome to fall, a season of tricky road conditions.

48:58.800 --> 49:02.520
"You and your cars will now FALL down this slippery mountain road

49:02.520 --> 49:04.920
"under the power of gravity alone -

49:04.920 --> 49:06.520
"no touching the accelerator.

49:06.520 --> 49:08.360
"Quickest to the bottom wins."

49:08.360 --> 49:11.040
That sounds like a completely relevant real-world test.

49:11.040 --> 49:13.840
This will be fun. I do this with my buddies on the motorcycles.

49:13.840 --> 49:16.400
Neutral all the way down the mountain.

49:16.400 --> 49:18.320
But I've got to say, it doesn't feel like fall.

49:21.680 --> 49:24.000
Ah, there we go. It does now.

49:24.000 --> 49:25.080
Very funny(!)

49:25.080 --> 49:27.320
Anyway, it's not fall, it's autumn.

49:27.320 --> 49:28.560
No, it's fall.

49:29.760 --> 49:32.000
English car show - autumn.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.480
We're in America, so it's fall.

49:34.480 --> 49:36.560
We invented the language. It's autumn.

49:36.560 --> 49:37.640
It's fall.

49:37.640 --> 49:39.560
We're not going to "autumn" down the hill.

49:39.560 --> 49:40.840
That's just a bad pun.

49:40.840 --> 49:43.720
Look, whoever wins the challenge gets to name the season. Deal?

49:43.720 --> 49:45.680
Deal. That's fair enough. Yeah, deal.

49:45.680 --> 49:46.840
Fall.

49:46.840 --> 49:49.640
'We would now take turns freewheeling our cars

49:49.640 --> 49:53.080
'to the bottom of the mountain, 1,000 feet below.

49:53.080 --> 49:55.880
'With the quickest down the winner...

49:55.880 --> 49:58.920
'it was time to let the blue bull run free.'

50:00.160 --> 50:02.280
Three, two, one!

50:08.800 --> 50:10.200
OK.

50:10.200 --> 50:11.440
Here we go. Come on.

50:11.440 --> 50:14.760
7, 8, 9, 10, 11,

50:14.760 --> 50:18.000
12, 13, 14, 15...

50:18.000 --> 50:19.640
OK, stay off the brake.

50:21.080 --> 50:23.160
Stay off the brake.

50:23.160 --> 50:24.200
Piece of cake.

50:25.280 --> 50:27.240
Let it run, let it run.

50:27.240 --> 50:31.760
'But as this 1Â½-ton, 200 grand rock gathered momentum...'

50:31.760 --> 50:33.320
Oh, this is weird.

50:33.320 --> 50:35.000
Such a weird feeling.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.920
'..this was becoming a test of not only skill...

50:37.920 --> 50:40.360
Oh, this is a tight one, here's a tight one.

50:40.360 --> 50:41.640
'..but bravery.'

50:41.640 --> 50:45.040
Oh, I got to brake, I got to brake.

50:45.040 --> 50:47.040
Ah, scrubbed too much speed right there!

50:47.040 --> 50:50.440
Come one, don't be a chicken. Stay off the brake.

50:50.440 --> 50:51.960
'Although the further I went...'

50:51.960 --> 50:53.000
Come on.

50:53.000 --> 50:54.440
'..the easier it became.'

50:54.440 --> 50:56.000
Be brave, the brave.

50:57.160 --> 50:59.520
All right, here comes the hairpin.

50:59.520 --> 51:01.120
Set up way out here.

51:01.120 --> 51:03.400
Brake.

51:03.400 --> 51:05.160
Do not go off the cliff.

51:06.200 --> 51:08.760
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

51:08.760 --> 51:10.520
Jesus.

51:10.520 --> 51:13.080
Right. Whoo.

51:13.080 --> 51:16.440
'And with the little blue bull really starting to run...'

51:16.440 --> 51:17.760
Whoo!

51:19.840 --> 51:22.440
'..nearing the bottom, we were flying.'

51:22.440 --> 51:26.120
76, 78, 79, 80, 81,

51:26.120 --> 51:29.040
82, 83, 84, 85, 86!

51:30.080 --> 51:32.360
Across the line.

51:32.360 --> 51:33.600
Whoo.

51:33.600 --> 51:34.920
'Felt fast,

51:34.920 --> 51:38.520
'but Harris's Porsche was heavier and potentially quicker.'

51:38.520 --> 51:40.720
Three, two, one.

51:44.280 --> 51:46.320
Come on!

51:46.320 --> 51:48.280
'OK, it's fair to say...'

51:48.280 --> 51:50.480
Eight, nine, ten.

51:50.480 --> 51:52.920
'..this isn't the sort of challenge I'm used to.'

51:52.920 --> 51:55.440
Oh, this is bloody awful.

51:55.440 --> 51:58.520
Now, if you're speeding with the car in neutral,

51:58.520 --> 52:01.120
is it still speeding on the road? Can you get a ticket for that?

52:01.120 --> 52:03.600
- Yeah, it's still speeding.
- Just curious. OK.

52:05.240 --> 52:09.040
'And I admit, I did find the whole "lack of engine" thing a bit...

52:09.040 --> 52:10.600
'tricky.'

52:10.600 --> 52:12.280
Oh, I shouldn't have braked!

52:12.280 --> 52:14.840
Oh, I've really wiped a load speed off there.

52:17.160 --> 52:19.680
Come on, here we go. Here we go.

52:21.120 --> 52:25.080
Oh, I don't know what's round the corner. I keep wanting to brake!

52:27.000 --> 52:29.440
Oh! Now I'm nervous!

52:31.880 --> 52:33.840
74, 75...

52:34.960 --> 52:38.320
Yeah-heh-heh-heh-heh!

52:38.320 --> 52:40.320
Could I have gone quicker? Yes.

52:40.320 --> 52:41.960
Would I want to? No.

52:44.320 --> 52:46.280
- OK, so you did it...
- Yeah?

52:46.280 --> 52:48.680
..in two minutes and 46 seconds.

52:48.680 --> 52:50.920
- Sounds reasonable.
- That's pretty good.

52:50.920 --> 52:52.600
- And I did it...
- Yeah?

52:52.600 --> 52:54.680
..in two minutes and three seconds.

52:58.320 --> 53:00.040
- That's a typo.
- I don't...

53:00.040 --> 53:02.600
- How can you be 43 seconds quicker?!
- That is, er...

53:02.600 --> 53:05.840
- You're a third quicker, basically, than me.
- Yeah, I...

53:05.840 --> 53:06.920
One third?!

53:08.280 --> 53:10.000
- Yeah, I...
- Sorry, I'm just looking...

53:10.000 --> 53:12.920
- Is there a parachute behind my...?
- I don't know. Let me see that.

53:12.920 --> 53:14.200
Cos the way this is written,

53:14.200 --> 53:16.600
it sounds like I just kicked your ass here.

53:18.920 --> 53:20.960
'Stupid challenge anyway.'

53:20.960 --> 53:22.920
'Now, as the winner of FALL...'

53:22.920 --> 53:24.400
43 seconds?!

53:24.400 --> 53:28.160
'..I had made it one apiece, with just one challenge remaining.

53:30.160 --> 53:33.040
'And as we climbed higher into the mountains...'

53:33.040 --> 53:34.840
Everything's getting whiter.

53:35.960 --> 53:38.080
And this is slightly concerning.

53:39.760 --> 53:41.920
'..winter was definitely coming.

53:42.920 --> 53:46.320
'And, arriving at Mammoth Mountain, our Four Seasons decider

53:46.320 --> 53:49.280
'looked like it would be the toughest challenge of them all.'

53:50.920 --> 53:52.880
Wow!

53:52.880 --> 53:54.680
So this is winter.

53:54.680 --> 53:55.840
Er...

53:55.840 --> 53:58.080
When does heavy snowfall become a blizzard?

53:58.080 --> 54:00.880
I don't know, but this feels pretty blizzardy.

54:00.880 --> 54:02.720
Ooh!

54:02.720 --> 54:05.680
- Oh, look. There's something in there. What is that?
- Hm.

54:08.560 --> 54:13.240
"Time for your final challenge - winter, a season of ice and snow.

54:13.240 --> 54:16.120
"You claimed your supercars could handle any weather.

54:16.120 --> 54:20.480
"You will now prove it by racing across Mammoth Mountain."

54:20.480 --> 54:23.320
We have to race across Mammoth Mountain?! That's a big mountain!

54:23.320 --> 54:24.360
Now, look here.

54:24.360 --> 54:27.160
After the last challenge, I fully intend to win this one.

54:27.160 --> 54:29.000
- OK.
- OK?
- Well, good luck to you.

54:30.640 --> 54:34.360
Mammoth Mountain sits at the heart of the Sierra Nevada range.

54:34.360 --> 54:38.200
To cross it, our challenge would start over 9,000 feet up,

54:38.200 --> 54:40.400
at the top of an icy ski slope.

54:40.400 --> 54:43.760
Plunging to the bottom, a two-mile drive through deep-drift snow

54:43.760 --> 54:48.240
would bring us to the final stage - a climb through dense forest,

54:48.240 --> 54:51.480
and a race to the finish on the other side of the mountain.

54:52.720 --> 54:56.560
It's 1-1. This is the decider. Winner takes all.

54:56.560 --> 55:00.680
All-wheel drive, 600 horsepower, Â£200,000 car.

55:00.680 --> 55:02.560
What could possibly go wrong?

55:02.560 --> 55:05.520
Three! Two! One!

55:05.520 --> 55:08.720
Go!

55:08.720 --> 55:10.040
Yes, baby!

55:11.600 --> 55:13.240
Oh, he got the jump on me.

55:16.560 --> 55:17.800
- I can't see
- BLEEP.

55:20.960 --> 55:24.160
Ugh. I'm doing about 80 in a snowdrift!

55:24.160 --> 55:26.160
So I've got to get to the other side of the mountain,

55:26.160 --> 55:28.080
where apparently it's not snowy.

55:30.520 --> 55:33.320
You know, when manufacturers talk about 0-60 times,

55:33.320 --> 55:36.760
they assume you're going to be on a road. But if you're on, say...

55:36.760 --> 55:41.400
Oh, I don't know, a ski slope, those times may vary slightly.

55:41.400 --> 55:43.160
Consumer advice right there.

55:44.880 --> 55:48.160
'Harris's all-weather Porsche had started well.

55:48.160 --> 55:49.200
'But then...'

55:49.200 --> 55:50.680
Whoa!

55:52.080 --> 55:53.360
Oh, I'm stuck.

55:55.640 --> 55:58.720
There's the pass. There's the pass.

56:00.240 --> 56:01.480
That is immature.

56:03.000 --> 56:04.360
Is this a blue run?

56:04.360 --> 56:06.320
It is now.

56:09.720 --> 56:14.000
'To stay in the race, Harris had been forced to call in some backup.'

56:16.040 --> 56:19.400
'And, on the other side of the mountain, the weather had cleared...

56:20.680 --> 56:22.560
'..and I was ploughing ahead.'

56:22.560 --> 56:24.720
Yeah, Lambo! Come on, baby! Come on!

56:25.840 --> 56:29.560
'But I was now out of the deep stuff and gaining fast.'

56:31.600 --> 56:35.800
'Going into the second stage, it was uphill all the way.'

56:35.800 --> 56:38.440
Flat pinned in third gear, going up a ski slope!

56:40.400 --> 56:43.760
'And the low-riding Lambo started to struggle.'

56:43.760 --> 56:45.360
Oh, I'm stuck, I'm stuck.

56:47.080 --> 56:48.880
Supercar coming through!

56:49.960 --> 56:51.760
Yeah-heh-heh-heh!

56:51.760 --> 56:53.840
Oh! It was going so good.

56:58.840 --> 57:00.280
'Pushing to open up a lead...'

57:00.280 --> 57:01.440
Whoa!

57:01.440 --> 57:04.920
'..keeping the hammer down was becoming more and more treacherous.'

57:04.920 --> 57:07.360
This is a rally stage!

57:07.360 --> 57:08.440
Whoa!

57:11.480 --> 57:13.920
'Now, since Chris had already bent the rules,

57:13.920 --> 57:16.800
'it seemed only fair to break out my secret weapon.'

57:18.160 --> 57:20.640
All right, back in the game.

57:22.480 --> 57:24.960
At least I have a fighting chance.

57:27.200 --> 57:28.880
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!

57:28.880 --> 57:32.720
'And, with the snow chains on, I soon had the Porsche in my sights.'

57:34.160 --> 57:35.360
Woohoo!

57:35.360 --> 57:38.680
You ain't getting away now, Harris. I got your number!

57:39.920 --> 57:43.360
There he is! Come on, Porsche!

57:43.360 --> 57:45.600
'At the final stage, we were neck-and-neck.

57:45.600 --> 57:47.040
'But with no way past...'

57:47.040 --> 57:48.400
Here we go, here we go.

57:48.400 --> 57:50.520
'..to stand any chance of winning,

57:50.520 --> 57:53.160
'I decided to take a different line through the forest

57:53.160 --> 57:55.440
'in a sprint to the finish.'

57:55.440 --> 57:57.080
Harris wants this one bad.

57:57.080 --> 57:59.120
That 43 seconds?

57:59.120 --> 58:01.440
That's driving him crazy, I can tell.

58:02.800 --> 58:05.920
Where is he?! Come on, Porsche!

58:05.920 --> 58:08.720
'Two truly incredible supercars.

58:10.040 --> 58:12.360
'But only one winner.'

58:14.000 --> 58:15.880
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

58:15.880 --> 58:18.320
Yeah!

58:18.320 --> 58:19.520
I've won!

58:22.960 --> 58:24.880
Oh! There's Harris!

58:31.440 --> 58:33.640
Oh, you got me.

58:33.640 --> 58:35.000
You got me.

58:35.000 --> 58:36.440
Congratulations.

58:36.440 --> 58:39.120
- How fun was that?!
- Amazing!
- Huh?

58:39.120 --> 58:44.160
We just all the way up a mountain in two supercars!

58:44.160 --> 58:45.520
Two sup...

58:45.520 --> 58:49.240
Well, in one supercar and one SUPER car.

58:49.240 --> 58:51.480
I mean, super competent.

58:51.480 --> 58:54.360
- It's a supercar!
- It's a great car.
- Come on.

58:54.360 --> 58:56.560
We can go round and round on this, I'm not going to stop.

58:56.560 --> 59:00.480
Cos you know it's not. It is a SUPER car, but it's not a supercar.

59:02.520 --> 59:05.520
Now, was that great? How great was that?

59:05.520 --> 59:07.120
That was mega.

59:07.120 --> 59:09.680
So jealous. So jealous.

59:09.680 --> 59:11.400
You drove up a ski slope.

59:11.400 --> 59:13.200
Yeah. Yeah.

59:13.200 --> 59:15.400
It's ridiculous that these cars managed to do that.

59:15.400 --> 59:17.760
I knew they were good, I didn't know they were that good.

59:17.760 --> 59:19.680
Yeah, neither did I. That was so much fun.

59:19.680 --> 59:22.640
That might be the most fun I have ever had in a car.

59:22.640 --> 59:24.080
And you know how Lamborghini's

59:24.080 --> 59:26.800
- building that new four-wheel-drive thing?
- Yeah, the Urus.

59:26.800 --> 59:28.920
Yeah, well, they don't need to build an off-roader,

59:28.920 --> 59:30.520
cos they have a great one right here.

59:30.520 --> 59:32.600
All right, Chris, we know if you had to pick one,

59:32.600 --> 59:34.040
you'd take the Porsche, right?

59:34.040 --> 59:36.840
- It's motoring perfection. It does EVERYTHING.
- OK.

59:36.840 --> 59:39.600
Matt, hand on heart time, between the three of us -

59:39.600 --> 59:42.040
if you had to go for the Porsche or the Huracan,

59:42.040 --> 59:43.240
what's it going to be?

59:43.240 --> 59:44.480
Oh, well, the Huracan,

59:44.480 --> 59:49.640
it's so theatrical and it has a spectacular motor. It is just...

59:49.640 --> 59:51.920
the Porsche for me too, I think.

59:51.920 --> 59:54.480
Yeah, I would say. It does everything.

59:54.480 --> 59:56.960
And you can... It has back seats, I can put the kids in it.

59:56.960 --> 59:58.640
You can do whatever you want with it.

59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.880
- It IS an all-season supercar.
- Yes!

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:03.560
- OK? Supercar.
- Yes!
- Happy?
- Yes.

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:07.760
All right, on next week's show, the Aston Martin DB11.

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:10.240
And motorsport, Caribbean style.

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:12.600
No, no, no, that's Caribbean-STYLEY.

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:17.120
- See you then.
- Good night!
- Good night!
