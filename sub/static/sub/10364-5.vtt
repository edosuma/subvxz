[Gry on TV]
I've always liked dipping candles.

00:21.080 --> 00:22.400
Thanks.

00:22.480 --> 00:28.760
One day I was sitting with my tub of wax,
watching a documentary from the West Bank

00:28.840 --> 00:30.880
when I was struck by the contrasts.

00:30.960 --> 00:35.160
Here I sit in my Norwegian living room
making candles,

00:35.240 --> 00:38.720
while the Palestinians live in darkness.

00:39.880 --> 00:44.320
That's when I had the idea
for "Light a Candle for Ramallah."

00:44.400 --> 00:48.160
- How has the response been?
- Fantastic.

00:48.240 --> 00:51.840
Together with some members
of the cultural elite,

00:51.920 --> 00:56.600
I have written
a "Light a Candle for Ramallah" song.

00:56.680 --> 00:58.760

- [Gry] Yes.

00:58.840 --> 01:00.760

Welcome.
I was mentioning your book here

01:31.600 --> 01:34.040
and I wonder,
how did you come up with this idea?

01:34.120 --> 01:39.000
Frank Costello, Lucky Luciano, Al Capone.

01:39.080 --> 01:40.840
You know how these guys died?

01:40.920 --> 01:43.640
- Gunshots or something like that?
- [Joey] No.

01:43.720 --> 01:48.000
They all died
from lifestyle-related diseases

01:48.080 --> 01:53.640
characterized by an excessive intake
of fats, sugars and wheat products.

01:53.720 --> 01:55.600
- [audience laughs]
- Is this true?

01:59.920 --> 02:03.560
[Joey]
Earlier, I lived my life in constant fear.

02:04.600 --> 02:09.280
Today, my biggest worry is
whether my vermicelli will be overcooked.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.200

Thank you. Thank you.

05:17.520 --> 05:21.480
When I first came to Norway,
I was struck by all the beauty.

Not to mention your beautiful GNP!

But you Norwegians, you got one flaw.

05:33.080 --> 05:35.040
You don't know how to enjoy life.

05:35.120 --> 05:37.720
That's why we opened this club.

And since you are using Israeli grapes,

05:54.320 --> 05:56.920
your wine is on her boycott list.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.560
Don't answer that.

05:58.640 --> 06:02.600
No, no, no, no.
We don't have to make any excuses.

06:02.680 --> 06:08.080
Israel is a beacon of freedom
in a region full of Arabic nutjobs.

06:08.160 --> 06:11.560
And if some lefty wants
to buy their wine from Al Qaeda,

06:11.640 --> 06:13.600

Fuck the social media!
A playground for teenage girls and fags!

07:24.000 --> 07:29.280
It is, but the Wine Monopoly lady
is quite stressed,

07:29.360 --> 07:32.160

looking after him. This is Bjørn's dad.

16:17.600 --> 16:20.680
I think the cops
might want a word with you first.

16:20.760 --> 16:24.720
- [Torgeir] The cops?
- [in English] Let me say this one time.

16:24.800 --> 16:26.560
Give me my fucking kid.

16:26.640 --> 16:30.000
[in Norwegian]
No, you listen here, foreigner.

16:30.080 --> 16:33.000
I myself am a product of neglect.

16:33.080 --> 16:36.440
I'm not going to allow the same thing
to happen to Jørn here.

16:36.520 --> 16:39.360
[in English] His name is Bjørn.

16:39.440 --> 16:42.400
It's not your mama's fault
that you're fucked up.

16:42.480 --> 16:47.560
You're fucked up
because you're a lowlife scumbag junkie.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.160
This is your last chance.

16:49.240 --> 16:54.320
[in Norwegian] Hey. Hey.
What the hell are you doing? Ouch.

16:54.400 --> 16:56.440
- [siren blares]
- [female junkie] Child abusers!

16:56.520 --> 16:59.760
- [Johnny in English] Time to go.
- [in Norwegian] We know who you are!

16:59.840 --> 17:03.240
They went that way!

17:09.440 --> 17:10.480
DELIVERIES

17:10.560 --> 17:13.200
[in English]
Wait a minute. Whoa.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.640
Keep the kids here.

17:41.720 --> 17:44.680
[Tommy gasping in pain]

17:59.840 --> 18:02.400
So where are all the blondes
you hear about?

18:04.000 --> 18:05.160
Sweden.

18:06.160 --> 18:07.920
You made a wrong turn.

18:10.960 --> 18:12.520
Are you Frank?

18:12.600 --> 18:14.280
Sometimes.

18:15.280 --> 18:17.240
They call me Johnny around here.

18:18.560 --> 18:20.200
You made good time.

18:22.600 --> 18:24.720
[grunts] I'm a little bit shot up here.

18:26.640 --> 18:28.280
Could you get me a doc?

18:29.280 --> 18:31.200
And a glass of vodka?

18:31.280 --> 18:32.880
[Tommy breathes heavily]

18:32.960 --> 18:34.400
You got it.

18:39.800 --> 18:43.160
I got word from New York
this might turn up on our doorstep.

18:43.240 --> 18:45.400
It's the nephew of Uncle Sal.

18:45.480 --> 18:46.800
Sal?

18:46.880 --> 18:49.800
Yeah, the guy who green-lit that thing
we did in New York.

18:51.160 --> 18:53.920
I guess we have to take care of him, then.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Good guess.

18:55.080 --> 18:57.600
[in Norwegian]
Shouldn't we get him to a doctor?

18:57.680 --> 19:00.720
[in English] Nah,
maybe we have to keep this quiet.

19:00.800 --> 19:03.000
[in Norwegian]
What about the doctor you had?

19:04.080 --> 19:07.520
[in English] What?
The Wicked Witch of the West? Come on.

19:07.600 --> 19:09.520
Okay. Bad idea.

19:10.880 --> 19:12.720
Wait a minute.

19:12.800 --> 19:14.880
What about that midwife?

19:14.960 --> 19:18.000
- The one we used for the babies?
- Yeah.

19:18.080 --> 19:22.840
Didn't we give him a running tab,
you know, as a way of saying thank you?

19:22.920 --> 19:25.000
Yes, we did.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.880
What's that up to?

19:26.960 --> 19:30.040
I think close to 50,000 or something.

19:30.120 --> 19:31.280
Bingo!

19:32.360 --> 19:34.760
[Svein in Norwegian]
Do you want more taco shells?

19:34.840 --> 19:36.000
[wife] Yes.

["Light a Candle for Ramallah"

19:52.240 --> 19:54.320
[in English] Long time, no see.

19:54.400 --> 19:56.480
Step into my office.

20:01.840 --> 20:03.720
[in Norwegian] What's this about?

20:03.800 --> 20:06.560
[in English]
We have a medical situation.

20:07.520 --> 20:08.640
[in Norwegian] A birth?

20:09.800 --> 20:12.040
[in English] Something like that.

20:12.120 --> 20:13.320
Come on.

20:15.640 --> 20:16.720
Show him.

20:21.160 --> 20:23.840
[in Norwegian] For God's sake!
Why the hell are you here?

20:23.920 --> 20:26.120
We need you to remove the bullet.

20:26.200 --> 20:29.440
Are you out of your fucking mind?

20:29.520 --> 20:32.200
[in English] Well, it's that

20:32.280 --> 20:35.680
or you pay the tab in full right now.

20:40.520 --> 20:43.120
So... what's it going to be?

20:46.480 --> 20:48.080
[Tommy groans]

20:48.160 --> 20:49.760
[Svein in Norwegian] All right.

20:51.560 --> 20:52.760
[Tommy cries out]

20:54.360 --> 20:56.000
[Tommy shouts]

20:59.520 --> 21:03.080
[in Norwegian] This is madness.
I'm no surgeon, for Christ's sake!

21:03.160 --> 21:06.200
Relax. If you can stitch up
some chick's box, you can do this.

21:09.040 --> 21:11.800
[shouts in English] Hey, hey!
Give me some goddamn drugs!

21:11.880 --> 21:13.680
[shouts] I don't have any drugs!

21:13.760 --> 21:15.640
What the fuck kind of doctor are you?

21:17.400 --> 21:18.720
I'm not exactly a doctor!

21:21.120 --> 21:24.840
But I am a certified midwife.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.240
A what?

21:27.320 --> 21:28.960
[Tommy whimpers]

21:29.040 --> 21:31.120
I'm so fucked! Fuck!

If he can deliver a baby,
he can deliver a bullet.

21:35.080 --> 21:37.200
[Tommy] No! No, no! No, no, no!

21:38.400 --> 21:40.480

21:48.680 --> 21:50.640
- Ali, was it?
- [Jan] Yes.

21:50.720 --> 21:52.760
- Muhammad Abdul Aziz Ali.
- Yes.

21:54.120 --> 22:00.600
I must admit I didn't really understand
your e-mail complaints.

22:00.680 --> 22:03.480
Are you dissatisfied
with the support you're receiving?

22:03.560 --> 22:05.920
No, the support is fine.

22:06.000 --> 22:10.160
But you're not doing enough
to resocialize me into Norwegian society.

22:10.240 --> 22:15.680
- I see. What is it you expect?
- [Jan] I don't know.

22:15.760 --> 22:21.520
Some sort of buddy system.
A sledding group, maybe?

22:21.600 --> 22:25.440
I'm afraid we don't offer that.

22:25.520 --> 22:26.920
The thing is,

22:27.000 --> 22:30.480
when a man with my qualifications
celebrates his birthday alone,

22:30.560 --> 22:32.440
the system has failed at some level.

22:34.560 --> 22:38.040
And I suspect that level
is sitting in front of me right now.

22:38.120 --> 22:39.320
[Jan laughs]

22:39.400 --> 22:45.880
- Excuse me, but this is...
- Okay. I know I'm a special case.

22:45.960 --> 22:49.840
Both Iraqi and Norwegian.
Been to prison, but highly educated.

22:49.920 --> 22:51.920
I fall between two stools.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.240
- That's why we must act now.
- Have you considered joining Facebook?

22:55.320 --> 22:57.240
- [Jan] Facebook?
- Yes.

22:59.320 --> 23:01.840
Do you know what was so great
about Norway in the past?

23:01.920 --> 23:02.920
No.

23:03.000 --> 23:07.880
We had a safety net
that caught those who fell outside.

23:07.960 --> 23:09.440
But we still do.

23:09.520 --> 23:14.160
That net has started to rot!

23:17.720 --> 23:22.560
I'm sorry you feel that way,

23:22.640 --> 23:24.040
but we have to wrap things up.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.920
Goddamn! What a rush!

23:34.880 --> 23:36.080
[in English] Congratulations.

23:36.160 --> 23:38.720
You have just given birth
to a nine-millimeter slug.

23:38.800 --> 23:40.840
I do not recommend breastfeeding.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.040
[chuckles]

23:42.120 --> 23:45.280
Fuck me.
You actually live in this fucked-up place?

23:47.280 --> 23:49.000
Yeah.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.760
[receptionist in Norwegian]
Is there a problem?

24:42.840 --> 24:48.000
[Jan] No. I'm here to see the minister of
Labor and Social Affairs, Robert Eriksson.

24:48.080 --> 24:50.800
You can't see the minister
without an appointment.

24:50.880 --> 24:54.480
The thing is, I'm here to file a complaint
regarding a serious error

24:54.560 --> 24:57.160
committed by
one of Eriksson's caseworkers.

24:57.240 --> 25:00.440
- You'll have to try to call instead.
- I've already called 42 times!

25:00.520 --> 25:03.040
Tell that Progress Party prick
to come down here

25:03.120 --> 25:04.480
and talk to me this instant!

25:04.560 --> 25:06.680
I think you should leave.

25:07.800 --> 25:11.280
We used to say
it was typically Norwegian to be good.

25:11.360 --> 25:14.600
Do you know what we should say now?

25:14.680 --> 25:18.160
[shouts] It's typically Norwegian
to be a fucking cunt. A fucking cunt.

25:18.240 --> 25:22.200
- Are? We have a situation here.
- [Jan] I'll find my own fucking way out.

25:22.280 --> 25:27.640
Who do you think you're dealing with?
I have a master's degree, for God's sake.

25:40.160 --> 25:42.520
[in English] Oh, thank you.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.040
Thank you.

26:00.840 --> 26:04.240
I want to thank everybody
for coming out tonight,

26:04.320 --> 26:08.960
celebrating the beginning
of the Flamingo wine label.

26:09.040 --> 26:11.200
- [cheering]
- We got off to a rocky start,

26:11.280 --> 26:14.960
but I'm proud to say
today we sold our first 1,000 bottles.

26:15.040 --> 26:16.680
[whooping]

26:16.760 --> 26:19.440
So may this be the beginning
of a beautiful thing!

26:19.520 --> 26:23.320
Go back, enjoy yourselves!

Good to see you back on your feet!

27:30.840 --> 27:33.240
I guess that midwife knew
what he was doing.

27:33.320 --> 27:35.120
Only the best for Sal's crew.

27:35.200 --> 27:38.200
Yeah, I thought Norway
was the dullest place on Earth,

27:38.280 --> 27:40.280
but this...

27:40.360 --> 27:42.680
You've got some real shit going on here.

27:42.760 --> 27:44.960
Thank you.

27:45.040 --> 27:48.480
You wouldn't by any chance
be looking for an extra pair of hands?

27:49.800 --> 27:51.280
You wouldn't like it here.

27:51.360 --> 27:53.400
Why not?

27:53.480 --> 27:57.840
Well, it's a whole different culture.
It's different.

28:00.040 --> 28:02.280
Maybe I could learn.

28:03.960 --> 28:08.160
All due respect,
you're here because of your uncle.

is okay even if you're pregnant.

- Yes.

- Yes, okay.

- Yes.

29:18.440 --> 29:23.920

from a health perspective,

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000

- [Birgitte] Yes.
- I don't know if you mind...

- [Birgitte] Yes. Okay. Let's try that.
- Okay.

Go on.

Shut up.

30:04.800 --> 30:07.880
Fuck her like the dog she is.
That's it. Go on.

30:07.960 --> 30:10.240
- Pump it.
- [Torgeir] Shut up.

30:10.320 --> 30:13.720
Go on. Fuck her, you Nordic nonce!

30:13.800 --> 30:16.840
I said fuck her. Harder!

Go on. Harder.

- Sorry.

- Sorry.

30:41.720 --> 30:42.760

[Birgitte] Damn, that hurt.

What's going on?

31:05.800 --> 31:09.920
Hi. I'm Terje Olsen.
I'm with the Child Welfare Authorities.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.520
My kids' welfare is fine.
Thanks for asking.

31:12.600 --> 31:14.280
I understand this can be a bit difficult,

31:14.360 --> 31:18.640
but we have received reports
from a concerned citizen.

31:20.320 --> 31:22.440
The fucking junkies down at the park?

31:22.520 --> 31:24.720
The report is not
the only reason I'm here.

31:24.800 --> 31:28.840
Our preliminary examinations show
that there have been episodes

31:28.920 --> 31:30.320
where you've lost your temper

31:30.400 --> 31:33.520
and we are worried
that this happens around your kids.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.880
I don't have a temper.

31:36.960 --> 31:39.840
Except the one
I'm about to stick up your fucking ass.

31:41.280 --> 31:45.480
Have you ever physically abused
your children, Mr. Henriksen?

31:45.560 --> 31:47.320
- Get the fuck out of here.
- [Terje] Listen.

Low blood sugar, maybe.

The thing is...

34:09.480 --> 34:12.320
Something happened a little while back,

of Johnny as a father.
