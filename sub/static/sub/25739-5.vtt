-No.
-And this was a long
journey to get here.

07:33.249 --> 07:35.623
-Yeah, it took a while.
-Let's take him to...
clean clothes.

-A laundromat.

I still don't think this is it.

That's where
you get your hair cut.

07:46.623 --> 07:48.748
I'm pretty positive a hospital
is where you get your hair cut.

07:48.831 --> 07:50.873
It's either a haircut
or the thermometer place.

07:50.957 --> 07:53.873
-One or the other.
-Okay, let's go
to a hair salon first.

07:53.957 --> 07:55.540
That's a better idea.

07:55.623 --> 07:57.207

Greenland sort of thing.

08:15.623 --> 08:16.998
What's the situation,
paper Mike?

08:17.082 --> 08:18.873
Okay. I hooked him
up to a generator

08:18.957 --> 08:20.415
that'll keep him alive,

08:20.499 --> 08:22.249

him plugged in.

08:22.332 --> 08:24.623
Well, unplug him

I'll pull the cord.

Oh, yeah, let's kill him.

This just feels bad.

08:41.290 --> 08:44.374

We're different.

to be different.

09:03.082 --> 09:04.623
But this hospital
is abandoned,

09:04.706 --> 09:06.581

stay here for a bit

15:21.915 --> 15:23.332
I'm a shoe.

15:23.415 --> 15:25.831
-Wow. Congratulations.
-That's what you are, a shoe!

15:25.915 --> 15:28.623
Guys, I was sensible.
I was practical.

15:28.706 --> 15:31.207
Like the playing style
of Benny Agbayani.

15:31.290 --> 15:32.998
-That's right!
-Shoe: Utilitarian.

15:33.082 --> 15:34.040
Who's up next?

15:34.915 --> 15:36.957
Oh, Mike's ex-wife.
Here she goes.

15:37.040 --> 15:38.665
Oh my god.
This is gonna be good.

15:38.748 --> 15:41.499
-Come on, rectangle!
-What is she?

15:41.581 --> 15:45.499
It says here
that I am a VHS copy

15:45.581 --> 15:47.790
of Can't Hardly Wait.

15:47.873 --> 15:49.706
-(cheering)
-That movie's so good!

15:49.790 --> 15:51.665
That movie's
a classic!

15:51.748 --> 15:54.998
-It is an honor, madam.
- Can't Hardly Wait
is the fucking shit.

15:55.082 --> 15:56.623
-Yes!
-Seth Green was great.

15:56.706 --> 15:57.998
And the girl from
Six Feet Under.

15:58.082 --> 15:59.706
-Pretty cool. She's great.
-She's pretty cool.

15:59.790 --> 16:02.207
I'm sorry, are we gonna skip
past Jennifer Love Hewitt?

16:02.290 --> 16:04.165
-JLH!
-Can we get a round of applause?

16:04.249 --> 16:07.207
And let's not forget
our star, Ethan Embry.

16:07.290 --> 16:08.915
He was so good!

16:08.998 --> 16:11.748
Gang? Should I go?

16:11.831 --> 16:14.415
-(cheering)
-You gotta go.
You gotta go.

16:14.499 --> 16:16.706
I got a feeling I'm like
a religious totem

16:16.790 --> 16:19.040
or, like, the Olympic torch
or something like that.

16:19.123 --> 16:20.581
-I got a vibe like that.
-Right, right, right.

16:20.665 --> 16:22.207
-Like, um...
-(beeping)

16:22.290 --> 16:23.540
This is gonna be good.

16:23.623 --> 16:25.873
I can tell,
this is really gonna be awesome.

16:25.957 --> 16:27.415
Shh, everybody.

16:27.499 --> 16:29.540
"Fleshlight.

16:29.623 --> 16:32.249
The fl-- The flashlight
you can fuck.

16:32.623 --> 16:34.748
This artificial pussy

16:34.831 --> 16:39.290
fits right in your pocket
for all your humpin' needs.

16:39.540 --> 16:42.290
Day. Night.
At the office.

16:42.540 --> 16:44.249
Go to town on this canister

16:44.332 --> 16:45.957
that you can splooge into."

16:46.499 --> 16:48.290
-That's pretty cool, yeah.
-That's nice, yeah.

16:48.374 --> 16:50.249
-'Cause you can...
functional and--
-Functional.

16:50.332 --> 16:51.623
Oh, God. That's nasty.

16:51.706 --> 16:54.540
I was a s-sex toy...

16:55.165 --> 16:57.623
that men would
ejaculate into.

16:57.706 --> 16:59.082
It's a natural function.
Don't be ashamed.

16:59.165 --> 17:00.415
Receipt:
Nothing to be
ashamed about.

17:00.499 --> 17:01.748
(groans)
I think I'm gonna be sick.

17:01.831 --> 17:02.998
I think
I'm gonna... (gags)

17:05.040 --> 17:07.040
You think when
he barfs, it's like, uh...

17:07.790 --> 17:09.499
it's like, some dude's
like, uh...

17:10.332 --> 17:11.540
Some dude's spunk?

17:11.623 --> 17:13.540
-Stop it, Mike! Come on!
-Aw, come on, Mike?

17:13.623 --> 17:15.915
-That's disgusting, man!
-What? I'm thinking.
We're all thinking it.

17:15.998 --> 17:17.831
Shut the fuck up,
fat Mike!

17:19.332 --> 17:21.207
(gulps, belches)

17:21.290 --> 17:23.957
You were right,
gross rectangle Mike.

17:24.040 --> 17:27.082
(hiccups)
I should have just spent
more of my time

17:27.165 --> 17:28.957
getting fucked up
and partying

17:29.040 --> 17:32.457
instead of figuring
out my purpose.

17:32.540 --> 17:34.957
I don't why I'm talking
to you, a vegetable,

17:35.040 --> 17:37.165
or whatever the fuck you are.

17:37.374 --> 17:40.332
We never looked you up.
I'm sorry about that, dude.

17:41.207 --> 17:45.581
You know, all the other Mikes
wanted to pull the plug on you.

17:45.665 --> 17:47.123
But I wouldn't let them.

17:47.207 --> 17:48.457
'Cause I was
the one who thought

17:48.540 --> 17:50.457
there was more
to this than nothing.

17:50.540 --> 17:53.374
But turns out,
nothing's everything.

17:54.249 --> 17:56.082
I'm gonna go jump off the roof.

17:57.374 --> 17:59.748
(grunting)

17:59.831 --> 18:01.207
Fucker, fucker.

18:02.207 --> 18:04.165
You mother fuckin' shit.

18:04.249 --> 18:05.790
Kick your fuckin' ass.

18:05.873 --> 18:07.998
-I know, but when
you know, you know.
-(laughing)

18:08.082 --> 18:09.374
Mike and I
want you to know

18:09.457 --> 18:11.790
how this incredible
outpouring of love from you

18:11.873 --> 18:13.499
mirrors the love
that we share.

18:13.581 --> 18:16.499
I am so sorry to interrupt
that beautiful speech, Shoe.

18:16.581 --> 18:18.873
I just really wanted
everybody here

18:18.957 --> 18:21.623
to meet my new
boyfriend, Mike.

18:21.706 --> 18:23.165
Hey, great to meet you, buddy.

18:23.249 --> 18:25.831
What's that, new Mike?
Whisper, whisper, whisper.

18:25.915 --> 18:28.165
Oh, my God,
of course I'll marry you!

18:28.249 --> 18:30.623
-We're getting
married everybody!
-Okay, on my special day?

18:30.706 --> 18:31.998
-Yeah!
-Oh, hello.

18:32.082 --> 18:33.623
So when you
guys are doing it,

18:33.706 --> 18:35.123
how do you manage
to not get crushed

18:35.207 --> 18:36.540
by all that fatso lard?

18:36.623 --> 18:38.207
-He likes my lard.
-Oh, so that's your thing.

18:38.290 --> 18:39.540
That's your little...

18:39.623 --> 18:42.290
Hey, guys. Great banter.
Has anyone seen Phil?

18:42.374 --> 18:43.374
-No. He's not here?
-Wait.

18:43.457 --> 18:44.706
I was sure he was here.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.706
And again,
I didn't get my dinner.

18:46.790 --> 18:48.706
He never, ever misses
any of our group meals.

18:48.790 --> 18:50.374
It's starting to feel like
an attack on me.

18:50.457 --> 18:52.040
He's in charge of
the Facebook invites
and everything.

18:52.123 --> 18:54.831
Wait, guys. When Mike
was depressed before,

18:54.915 --> 18:58.082
Phil was wondering if he'd
unlife himself off the roof.

18:58.165 --> 18:59.457
You don't think...

18:59.665 --> 19:01.748
-Oh, no!
-Eee! Oy-yoi-yoi-yoi-yoi!

19:01.831 --> 19:03.623
-Guys, we gotta get him.
-Let's go!

19:04.831 --> 19:07.040
I just can't believe
I get to spend

19:07.123 --> 19:09.040
the rest of my life
with my best friend.

19:09.123 --> 19:10.581
-You...
-Come on, Mike! Let's go!

19:10.665 --> 19:11.831
Fuck! I'm coming.

19:11.915 --> 19:13.998
♪ ♪

19:14.665 --> 19:16.207
-There he is!
-Oh, my God! Look, there he is!

19:16.290 --> 19:17.374
-There he is!
-What's his name?

19:17.457 --> 19:18.998
The flashlight fuck boy.

19:19.082 --> 19:20.665
Step back from
the ledge, bro!

19:20.748 --> 19:22.332
Fleshlight,
don't do it, man!

19:22.415 --> 19:26.415
I thought I was great,
a great unifier of things.

19:26.540 --> 19:29.290
But I was just
a fake vagina

19:29.374 --> 19:31.040
that you have to put
in warm water

19:31.123 --> 19:33.123
for five minutes
before using.

19:33.207 --> 19:34.581
I am nothing.

19:34.665 --> 19:36.706
Listen to me.

19:36.790 --> 19:38.374
-Phil.
-(gasps)

19:38.457 --> 19:40.706
It doesn't matter
what you were.

19:40.790 --> 19:43.082
It just matters
what you are.

19:43.165 --> 19:45.040
Yeah! Shape your future!

19:45.123 --> 19:46.249
Thank you.

19:46.332 --> 19:47.915
And I love
Can't Hardly Wait .

19:47.998 --> 19:50.790
-Like, it's so fucking good.
-It's really a great movie.

19:50.873 --> 19:52.957
And plus, you probably
brought a lot of joy

19:53.040 --> 19:55.082
to at least, like,
one pretty sad dude.

19:55.165 --> 19:56.415
-Yeah.
-Maybe two.

19:56.499 --> 19:57.748
That's true.

19:57.831 --> 19:59.748
Hey, man. Most of all,
you united us all.

19:59.831 --> 20:02.123
We're all best friends now,
right, gang? Right?

20:02.207 --> 20:03.957
I brought us
all together, didn't I?

20:04.040 --> 20:05.748
Come on, you guys.
Friends hug?

20:05.831 --> 20:08.374
Friends hug!

20:08.457 --> 20:10.499
-You guys!
-You bunch of knuckleheads!

20:10.581 --> 20:12.665
We're gonna
be okay after all.

20:12.748 --> 20:15.123
Johnny:
Bestowing life
into the inanimate.

20:15.207 --> 20:16.748
Who could say
they would handle
it better?

20:16.831 --> 20:18.082
I don't know if I could.

20:18.165 --> 20:19.957
Could you? Perhaps
you'd be like Baseball

20:20.040 --> 20:21.623
and constantly
search for love.

20:21.706 --> 20:24.332
Or Fleshlight and constantly
search for purpose. Or like--

20:24.415 --> 20:25.499
(gasping)

20:25.581 --> 20:27.790
VHS:
Holy shit, it's this guy!

20:27.873 --> 20:29.457
-(maniacal laughter)
-Baseball: Take it easy, Mike!

20:29.540 --> 20:31.831
You motherfuckers
wanted to kill me?

20:31.915 --> 20:33.165
-No, no, no, dude.
-Me?

20:33.249 --> 20:34.998
-It wasn't like that...
-The kid is back.

20:35.082 --> 20:36.623
Now, all y'all gonna pay!

20:36.706 --> 20:38.623
(maniacal laughter)

20:38.706 --> 20:41.165
This is sick.
I'm like a fuckin' super hero.

20:41.249 --> 20:43.123
(sobbing)
No!

20:43.207 --> 20:46.831
No, new Mike! No!

20:47.998 --> 20:49.665
Friend funeral?
Friend funeral?

20:49.748 --> 20:51.207
-I don't know, man.
-Friend funeral?

20:51.290 --> 20:52.831
Do you do funerals
for fake Mikes?

20:52.915 --> 20:53.957
-I don't think so.
-Enough!

20:54.040 --> 20:56.165
Two tears in the bucket.
Fuck it.

20:56.249 --> 20:58.374
I told you I was gonna
paint this town red.

20:58.457 --> 21:00.540
And now I will.
With your blood.

21:00.623 --> 21:04.957
(screaming)
Motherfucker!

21:06.415 --> 21:07.499
(gasping)

21:07.581 --> 21:09.165
He turned back
just in to a thing.

21:09.249 --> 21:11.165
-Well, that's a relief.
-I did not see that coming.

21:11.249 --> 21:12.332
So we beat the bad guy.

21:12.415 --> 21:13.957
-Yeah, nice!
-Way to go, guys!

21:14.040 --> 21:15.332
-What a relief!
-Fives all around, dude.

21:15.415 --> 21:16.831
-Yeah.
-Wait a minute.

21:16.915 --> 21:18.790
It's 8:16 PM.

21:18.873 --> 21:21.540
It's exactly 24 hours
since we came out of the Orb.

21:21.623 --> 21:24.374
What if we're in a
Cinderella scenario?

21:24.457 --> 21:25.665
Who came out second?

21:25.748 --> 21:28.332
Wait. I-- I did.

21:28.415 --> 21:30.082
Oh, God.
Please, don't let me...

21:30.957 --> 21:32.040
(groans)

21:32.123 --> 21:33.415
Oh, shit yourself!
I was right!

21:33.499 --> 21:34.581
This sucks!

21:34.665 --> 21:36.165
Curse my genius!

21:36.249 --> 21:38.082
Well, it was fun
while it lasted.

21:38.165 --> 21:39.831
Look, if this is
gonna happen,

21:39.915 --> 21:41.499
VHS, I want us
to go together.

21:41.581 --> 21:43.040
-Hold my hand.
-Okay, Thelma and Louise style.

21:43.123 --> 21:44.540
Hey, wait a minute.

21:44.623 --> 21:45.748
Have you been
watching other movies?

21:45.831 --> 21:47.998
No! Honey, no!
Of course not.

21:48.082 --> 21:49.374
It's just
it's on Youtube.

21:49.457 --> 21:51.540
-It's a zeitgeist thing.
-Yeah, just out there.

21:51.623 --> 21:52.998
One, two...

21:53.082 --> 21:55.623
-three!
-Woo-hoo!

21:56.957 --> 21:59.540
I guess old Benny Agbayani's
leaving this world

21:59.623 --> 22:00.748
the way he came in.

22:00.831 --> 22:02.998
The best there ever was.

22:03.082 --> 22:05.290
(crowd cheers)

22:07.623 --> 22:09.332
Receipt:
At first,

22:09.415 --> 22:11.957
I wasn't sure why they
all turned back and I didn't.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.706
I continued my inventions

22:14.790 --> 22:16.457
and killed some time
here and there.

22:16.540 --> 22:18.915
Man (on TV):
What about that time
during softball practice

22:18.998 --> 22:20.790
when Ricky Feldman
hit that line drive

22:20.873 --> 22:22.249
and it hit you
right in your nuts!

22:22.332 --> 22:23.290
(laughs)

22:23.374 --> 22:26.998
(laughs)
It holds up.
It's still great.

22:27.290 --> 22:30.915
Receipt:
But eventually, resources
at the hospital ran low.

22:30.998 --> 22:32.374
So I wandered,

22:32.457 --> 22:34.623
into New York City.

22:34.706 --> 22:37.748
I noticed that
I was unnoticed.

22:37.831 --> 22:40.581
Us things were so
scared of being different,

22:40.665 --> 22:42.873
when everyone's different.

22:42.957 --> 22:44.249
I kept thinking about

22:44.332 --> 22:46.415
what hot ass
Fleshlight Phil would say,

22:46.499 --> 22:48.249
about bringing us together.

22:48.332 --> 22:50.123
Unification.

22:50.207 --> 22:52.415
I couldn't get it
out of my head.

22:52.499 --> 22:55.790
Perhaps with my genius,
I could help.

22:55.873 --> 22:57.915
(tools whirring)

22:57.998 --> 23:00.165
A tool to bring
down the barriers

23:00.249 --> 23:01.790
amongst the animals,

23:01.873 --> 23:04.165
a grand communicator.

23:04.374 --> 23:07.082
I didn't really need to use
Phil and the Mikes,

23:07.165 --> 23:08.957
but I felt bad just leaving
them in the hospital,

23:09.040 --> 23:10.332
and plus, it was symbolic

23:10.415 --> 23:13.123
and really
satisfactory storytelling.

23:13.207 --> 23:15.165
I knew where
I needed to bring it.

23:15.249 --> 23:17.499
The place we were born.

23:22.706 --> 23:26.082
Orb speed, my friends.
Orb speed.

23:29.998 --> 23:31.706
(chittering)

23:34.540 --> 23:35.957
(feedback whines)

23:36.040 --> 23:37.499
What is this thing?

23:37.581 --> 23:39.831
(gasps, cheers)

23:39.915 --> 23:41.290
Holy shit!

23:41.374 --> 23:42.998
When you talk into it,
