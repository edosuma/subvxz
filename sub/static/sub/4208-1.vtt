00:30.310 --> 00:32.403
<i>Will that be all for you?</i>

00:38.118 --> 00:41.144
<i>There you go.
Have a good night.</i>

00:47.427 --> 00:49.486
<i>You want this one?</i>

01:04.044 --> 01:06.274
Where are you going?
Come on. Party time, huh?

01:06.346 --> 01:08.337
Hey!

01:09.683 --> 01:11.674
Hey, wait up!

01:24.698 --> 01:27.360
Looking for company?

01:37.577 --> 01:39.602
It's pretty shitty
out there, huh?

01:40.881 --> 01:43.349
Hoo.

01:43.417 --> 01:47.080
<i>I like the rain.
Keeps everybody inside...</i>

01:47.154 --> 01:49.714
and washes everything clean.

01:49.790 --> 01:51.724
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

01:54.161 --> 01:56.891
<i>So, anyway,
it's 75 for a straight fuck...</i>

01:56.963 --> 01:59.932
50 for a B.J.
And 25 for a pump and run.

02:06.473 --> 02:08.907
Show me what you got.

02:12.479 --> 02:14.413
Where you haulin'?

02:14.481 --> 02:16.847
Heading home.

02:16.917 --> 02:20.353
- Lucky you.
- The wig too.

02:26.927 --> 02:29.760
So we gonna get started
here or what?

02:41.741 --> 02:43.709
<i>Get it wet for me.</i>

02:45.178 --> 02:49.137
<i>- Are you kiddin'?
- Do it.</i>

02:49.216 --> 02:51.150
Now!

02:53.053 --> 02:55.180
You know what?
Screw this.

02:58.258 --> 03:00.317
What the fuck!

03:01.595 --> 03:03.995
You want out?

03:04.064 --> 03:06.532
There's your exit.

03:12.806 --> 03:15.138
You're a fucking freak.

03:31.791 --> 03:34.385
Somebody help me!

03:45.438 --> 03:48.236
<i>Oh, my God, Kaylal
Oh, my God, look outl</i>

03:48.308 --> 03:52.039
Oh, my God!

03:54.347 --> 03:58.340
- Oh, my God.
- Oh! Why? Why?

03:58.418 --> 04:00.909
- Are you kidding? Not funny.
- I don't wanna die.

04:00.987 --> 04:03.717
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

04:03.790 --> 04:06.623
I'm sorry, baby.
She made me.

04:06.693 --> 04:09.457
Mel, I did not make you.
That was totally your idea.

04:09.529 --> 04:13.465
That's the quality time you guys want to
spend together? To kill me in my sleep?

04:19.505 --> 04:22.100
You should wait and see
what we have in store for Vegas.

04:25.979 --> 04:27.469
- You know what I'm gonna do?
- What?

04:27.547 --> 04:33.076
<i>I'm gonna go into a dark corner,
and I'm gonna gamble by myself...</i>

04:33.153 --> 04:36.520
while you guys go do the
whole bachelor/bachelorette thing.

04:36.590 --> 04:39.650
<i>Don't be such a baby.
We agreed to do the parties together...</i>

04:39.726 --> 04:44.186
so everyone would have
an equal opportunity to torture us.

04:45.365 --> 04:47.333
Hey, chill. Chill!

04:47.400 --> 04:50.335
I don't want you staining
the fine Corinthian leather.

04:50.403 --> 04:52.667
What a waste
of fine Corinthian.

04:52.739 --> 04:54.934
You dare mock the '83 Chevy
Caprice wagon?

04:55.008 --> 04:59.775
Yes, I do. Question:
Why did we not fly to Vegas?

04:59.846 --> 05:04.283
<i>Because Kay and I haven't seen
each other since Christmas...</i>

05:04.351 --> 05:06.546
and I miss my little sister.

05:06.620 --> 05:08.884
I miss you too, Sis.

05:31.277 --> 05:33.370
Congratulations, Kay.

05:33.446 --> 05:36.540
<i>You've found a genuine ghost town.</i>

05:36.616 --> 05:38.777
Okay, is this place even open?

05:44.691 --> 05:48.058
- Fill her up, ma'am?
- Sure.

05:51.698 --> 05:55.190
He's kind of cute. No?

05:55.268 --> 05:58.032
No. No.

06:02.042 --> 06:06.240
You know, ma'am, here
at Inbred Jed's, we require
that you pay in advance.

06:06.312 --> 06:08.644
- Really?
- Really.

06:08.715 --> 06:10.546
<i>- Uh-
- Okay.</i>

06:10.617 --> 06:12.983
What the-

06:13.053 --> 06:14.645
<i>Uh-</i>

06:14.721 --> 06:16.814
- Psych.
Okay.

06:16.890 --> 06:19.882
Hey, whoa. Hey, whoa!

06:19.959 --> 06:21.859
<i>Hey, hey, hey.
What the hell is going on?</i>

06:21.928 --> 06:27.161
Nik, this is my sister, Mel,
and her fiance, Bobby.

06:27.233 --> 06:28.996
You are way hotter
in person.

06:29.069 --> 06:31.594
Wait a minute. Is this
the guy you've been talking
to on MySpace?

06:31.671 --> 06:34.196
<i>33,628 friends and counting...</i>

06:34.274 --> 06:36.367
and Kayla is number one.

06:36.443 --> 06:39.708
- You're my number one.
- Okay. All right. What's happening?
What's going on?

06:39.779 --> 06:41.713
Nik's gonna be my date
in Vegas.

06:41.781 --> 06:44.875
- He took a bus all the way
from Salt Lake City to meet me.
- Okay.

06:44.951 --> 06:47.283
C- Could you please
join me in the bathroom?

06:49.689 --> 06:51.418
Okay.

06:57.263 --> 07:01.199
- Are you kidding me?
- Look, I know Brad's gonna be there tomorrow.

07:01.267 --> 07:05.260
<i>And I haven't seen him since we broke up.
I just wanted to show up with somebody.</i>

07:05.338 --> 07:07.033
But you barely know this guy.

07:07.107 --> 07:09.940
I barely know you since
you moved away to be with Bobby.

07:10.009 --> 07:12.068
Which one's yours again?

07:14.047 --> 07:15.981
I jest.

07:16.049 --> 07:19.416
I don't understand anything you said.
You have two things right here.

07:19.486 --> 07:21.818
Nik and I have been talking on the phone
every day for the past five months.

07:21.888 --> 07:26.120
- Yeah, online.
- Online, on the phone, over webcam.

07:26.192 --> 07:30.322
<i>He's not a serial killer. Trust me,
I googled his name and everything.</i>

07:30.396 --> 07:32.762
Do you need the change?

07:32.832 --> 07:35.426
- Come on. Come on.
- There you go.

07:35.502 --> 07:38.801
Check this out.

07:38.872 --> 07:41.864
This road would be a lot faster.
No traffic, no cops.

07:41.941 --> 07:44.136
Free at last.
No hassle from the man.

07:46.913 --> 07:51.407
Look, I didn't tell you because I knew
you'd try to talk me out of it.

07:51.484 --> 07:55.477
Yeah, exactly. Why do I always have to
be the voice of reason with you?

07:55.555 --> 07:57.580
Come on, Sis.

07:57.657 --> 08:01.457
Please? Pretty please?

08:01.528 --> 08:03.496
I just want
to have some fun.

08:05.198 --> 08:10.431
<i>Fine, but you have to promise
to feed him, water him...</i>

08:10.503 --> 08:13.995
- and clean up after him.
- I will, I promise.

08:14.073 --> 08:18.009
Uh, I'm not really a back roads
type of guy, buddy.

08:18.077 --> 08:21.171
Uh, they built the highways
for a reason. Stick to 'em.

08:21.247 --> 08:24.239
Yeah, to slow shit down, man.

08:24.317 --> 08:27.514
<i>Think about it. The faster we get to Vegas,
the faster we start cashing in...</i>

08:27.587 --> 08:31.489
- the faster we start having fun.
- Come on, Bobby.

08:34.294 --> 08:37.126
- Come on.
- Let's go.

08:37.197 --> 08:39.529
We're going to Vegas!

08:43.736 --> 08:47.137
We've been driving over an hour and
we haven't even seen the main highway yet.

08:47.207 --> 08:50.802
That's because we're running exactly
parallel to it, sweetheart.

08:50.877 --> 08:54.643
<i>It's simple physics. Relax.</i>

08:54.714 --> 08:57.239
We're fine as long
as we keep heading west.

09:00.887 --> 09:03.583
<i>Oh, would you look at this.
A dirt road.</i>

09:03.656 --> 09:06.250
<i>Yeah, this has to mean
civilization is close, right?</i>

09:06.326 --> 09:09.591
<i>Or is this the main entrance to Vegas, Nik?
'Cause I don't know. I've never been.</i>

09:09.662 --> 09:12.927
Quit busting my balls, man.
It was your map.

09:19.706 --> 09:21.674
What the fuck is that smell?

09:22.642 --> 09:24.872
- Oh, no.
- Oh, shit!

09:24.944 --> 09:27.435
- Pull the car over.
- What's wrong with it?

09:27.513 --> 09:29.845
- Anywhere, pull over. Pull it over.
- I am.

09:29.916 --> 09:31.850
Okay.

09:31.918 --> 09:35.410
Geez, just stop the car. Stop the car.

09:37.290 --> 09:39.622
<i>- Thank you.
- What are we gonna do?</i>

09:54.774 --> 09:56.605
What is it?

09:56.676 --> 10:00.442
The engine seized.

10:00.513 --> 10:04.244
Did you ever think- Did you ever think
maybe you should put some oil in there?

10:04.317 --> 10:07.218
I don't know about that stuff.

10:09.055 --> 10:13.253
<i>She had a good run. Isn't this Grammy's car?</i>

10:13.326 --> 10:16.124
- Yeah.
- Well, I'll miss her.

10:16.195 --> 10:19.255
Aw, that's sad. I feel like
we should bury it or something.

10:24.070 --> 10:26.630
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me now?

10:26.706 --> 10:29.573
Can you hear me now?
No shit.

10:29.642 --> 10:31.906
Which way do you think?

10:31.978 --> 10:36.347
<i>Well, we know nothing's down
there for a hundred miles, so-</i>

10:39.419 --> 10:42.115
<i>I say we keep going down
this way.</i>

10:42.188 --> 10:44.179
<i>- Straight to Vegas, right, Nik?
- Right, Nik.</i>

10:45.325 --> 10:47.486
- Right, Bobby.
- Asshole.

10:47.560 --> 10:49.619
Okay, guys.

11:13.920 --> 11:18.448
- We're in hell.
- At least that means
we're not completely lost.

11:18.524 --> 11:21.516
You may want to surrender your Goth pride,
Nik, and lose the black jacket.

11:21.594 --> 11:26.031
<i>I'm not Goth, jock. Third-wave emo punk,
if you insist on using labels.</i>

11:26.099 --> 11:29.626
Well, it's first-wave jackass
to wear black in the desert.

11:29.702 --> 11:31.431
<i>- Tell that to the bedouins.
- I will.</i>

11:31.504 --> 11:34.200
Wait a minute. What's that?

11:38.778 --> 11:41.008
<i>Sweet.</i>

11:41.080 --> 11:43.241
What are we gonna do?
Bust right in, or what?

11:45.785 --> 11:47.980
Looks like our luck's changing.

11:48.054 --> 11:51.148
See you're good for something, jock.

11:56.763 --> 11:58.993
Holy shit!

12:05.238 --> 12:07.229
This mail's over a month old.

12:10.810 --> 12:12.744
Anyone home?

12:13.846 --> 12:15.780
- Hello!
- Hello!

12:15.848 --> 12:19.045
Hello! Anyone home?

12:21.120 --> 12:23.111
Hello.

12:29.362 --> 12:32.058
Still got nothing.

12:38.805 --> 12:40.568
Nik?

12:40.640 --> 12:42.540
Nik!

12:44.644 --> 12:48.136
<i>Oh, my God. Oh, my God!</i>

12:48.214 --> 12:50.114
What is it?

12:55.488 --> 12:58.480
What?

12:58.558 --> 13:02.255
Oh, I'm sorry.
These are a bitch to open sometimes.

13:02.328 --> 13:05.923
<i>- You think they'd fix that.
- We just busted down a door and broke a window.</i>

13:05.998 --> 13:08.728
What do you want to do next?
Set this place on fire?

13:10.236 --> 13:12.295
Where are you going?
This place is empty.

13:12.371 --> 13:17.308
<i>Whoever lived here before hasn't lived here
for a long time. Bobby? Bobby?</i>

13:17.376 --> 13:19.606
- You scared the shit out of us.
- I'm sorry, baby.

13:26.986 --> 13:28.920
Oh, gross.

13:30.423 --> 13:33.620
These expired, like, a year ago.

13:34.827 --> 13:37.295
Scooby snack?

13:37.363 --> 13:39.763
Like Scooby Doo?

13:41.567 --> 13:44.536
I thought you said therapy
helped your sister's control issues.

13:44.604 --> 13:47.505
I told you that because I thought
you'd never meet her.

13:47.573 --> 13:50.838
<i>I don't see what the big deal
is. I think it's kind of sexy.</i>

13:50.910 --> 13:53.777
<i>I'll show you sexy... later.</i>

13:55.548 --> 13:58.039
Later, later, later.

13:59.785 --> 14:02.151
- Later, later, later.
- Creepy.

14:12.498 --> 14:14.625
- All the phones are dead.
- Everything's dead here.

14:14.700 --> 14:19.160
<i>You know, this place has got to be one of those
weekend retreat slash meth-lab combo deals...</i>

14:19.238 --> 14:22.173
<i>or something,
because this is pathetic.</i>

14:22.241 --> 14:25.210
<i>- We should get out ofhere before sunset.
- I think we should go.</i>

14:26.445 --> 14:29.642
<i>Check this out.</i>

14:33.953 --> 14:37.150
Wow, talk about valley of death.

14:39.158 --> 14:41.592
Nice piece of real estate.

14:41.661 --> 14:44.323
You know what they say.
Location, location, location.

14:44.397 --> 14:46.661
Bobby, don't go any closer.

14:46.732 --> 14:49.166
Don't worry.
I'll protect you.

14:49.235 --> 14:52.636
- Let's get out of here.
- You wanna check out the barn?

14:52.705 --> 14:54.639
Just what do you have in mind,
mister?

14:54.707 --> 14:58.541
Oh, simply a wholesome appreciation
of early Western rustic architecture.

15:16.128 --> 15:19.928
This place keeps getting
more and more charming.

15:39.485 --> 15:41.077
Come on!

15:41.153 --> 15:44.145
- You're suck a jerk!
- Asshole.

15:52.665 --> 15:54.656
You scared me.

16:02.875 --> 16:05.969
I'm down with the freaky, but-

16:06.045 --> 16:10.072
This is just pushing it.

16:13.486 --> 16:15.147
What is that?

16:31.771 --> 16:36.105
- Wow.
- Our motherfucking salvation!

16:36.175 --> 16:39.838
A 1971 Chevy Chevelle hardtop.

16:39.912 --> 16:42.312
- It's an American classic.
- Dibs!

16:45.418 --> 16:48.046
<i>Oh, no wayl</i>

16:48.120 --> 16:51.886
Breaker, breaker, this is Captain Winky
looking for Pink Taco.

16:51.957 --> 16:54.323
<i>- You out there, R.T.
- Nobody uses C. BIs anymore.</i>

16:54.393 --> 16:56.384
Truckers do.

17:01.534 --> 17:04.992
God is quite literally handing us this
fine automobile. Who are we to deny him?

17:05.070 --> 17:09.303
You are not thinking about taking this car?
What if the owners come back?

17:09.375 --> 17:12.810
We don't really know how long these people
are gonna be gone. They could be on vacation.

17:12.877 --> 17:16.244
<i>Or they could have died in
a freak combine/thresher accident. Who knows?</i>

17:16.315 --> 17:18.249
<i>I mean, come on.</i>

17:18.317 --> 17:21.309
Oh, listen to that purr.

17:21.387 --> 17:24.049
And it's full of gas. Hop in.
Let's take this bitch for a ride.

17:24.123 --> 17:26.057
Nobody's stealing anybody's car.

17:26.125 --> 17:29.822
At most we're borrowing it.

17:29.895 --> 17:33.228
Exactly. We're gonna borrow it for
a little joyride, which is guaranteed fun.

17:33.299 --> 17:34.707
I mean, "joy" is built right
into that sentence.

17:34.808 --> 17:36.261
Well, that's grand theft auto.

17:37.603 --> 17:42.040
<i>- And what's the alternative?
- We can't really hang out in that creepy house.</i>

17:42.108 --> 17:45.043
She's right, Mel. We can't be out
in the desert at night.

17:45.111 --> 17:48.478
<i>How about this? We take this car
to the nearest town.</i>

17:48.547 --> 17:54.110
In the morning we'll rent a car, return this one
with cash inside for how much the damage is.

17:54.186 --> 17:56.746
<i>- Right, Nik?
- Yeah, uh-huh. Right.</i>

18:00.926 --> 18:02.723
- Fine.
- Yes!

18:02.795 --> 18:05.958
<i>- I'm riding shotgun.
- You can ride whatever you want.</i>

18:08.434 --> 18:11.801
<i>You got the keys?</i>

18:16.175 --> 18:19.941
Don't worry. We'll stop by Kayla's car and
get the bags. Everything's gonna be okay.

18:20.012 --> 18:23.209
Okay, but I'm leaving my number
in case the owner comes back.

18:23.282 --> 18:27.446
Smart and sensible.
Just like my baby.

18:31.957 --> 18:34.357
<i>- Come on, Mell
- Come on. Let's gol</i>

18:35.561 --> 18:37.893
<i>Let's gol</i>

18:37.963 --> 18:40.488
Come on. Get in.

19:42.194 --> 19:46.722
<i>All right. A II right. Thank you.
Okay, so good news.</i>

19:46.799 --> 19:51.202
There's a car rental place in Cedar City about
an hour away. They're holding a car for us.

19:51.270 --> 19:53.465
Oh, good. I called Michelle
to tell her we'd be late.

19:53.539 --> 19:56.167
But I told her we'd meet
her in Vegas tonight.

19:56.242 --> 19:59.040
See, everybody?
That wasn't such a bad little detour, was it?

20:22.067 --> 20:24.399
- Watch your head, Sis.
- Oh. Thanks.

20:26.005 --> 20:30.032
<i>See, this is a ride.</i>

20:30.109 --> 20:34.512
<i>'92 Harley Heritage Softail Classic.</i>

20:34.580 --> 20:38.209
Fishtail carbs,
Corbin seat, and a bitch pad.

20:38.284 --> 20:43.017
<i>Wow, that's extremely
butch of you, Melissa. No offense.</i>

20:43.088 --> 20:48.219
All right, let me see if I know my fiancee.
You dated a gearhead in high school.

20:48.294 --> 20:51.024
Gary Braddock.

20:51.096 --> 20:55.430
<i>- I thought he was so hot.
- He taught us both how to ride.</i>

20:55.501 --> 20:57.264
I just think he
wanted to hook up a threesome.

20:57.336 --> 21:00.305
<i>And who could blame poor
Gary Braddock for that?</i>

21:00.372 --> 21:03.500
<i>Don't worry.
It never went anywhere.</i>

21:03.576 --> 21:05.771
I just liked to ride his bike.

21:05.844 --> 21:08.278
<i>What the-</i>

21:08.347 --> 21:11.043
Fuck you, asshole!

21:11.116 --> 21:13.482
- Yeah, rage against the machine, motherfucker!
- Son of a bitch!

21:13.552 --> 21:15.543
Fuck.

21:26.231 --> 21:29.325
I got me a bodacious case
of beaver fever, that's for sure.

21:29.401 --> 21:32.461
Your old lady finds out,
you'll be off the super slab for good.

21:32.538 --> 21:34.597
About my 18th hour straight.

21:34.673 --> 21:37.471
Oh, my God, is that
Shakespeare we're hearing?

21:37.543 --> 21:41.274
<i>Take it you kids are from out of town,
on your way to Vegas?</i>

21:41.347 --> 21:44.373
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

21:44.450 --> 21:48.716
Five bucks says she's got two names,
like Amy Sue, or PeggyJo, or-

21:48.787 --> 21:52.621
- Twenty and you're on, harelip.
- Here you go. Best seats in the house.

21:52.691 --> 21:55.421
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

21:56.829 --> 21:58.421
I'm Nik.

21:58.497 --> 22:02.024
I'm Jolene. That's one name,
not two. Guess you lost, pumpkin.

22:05.671 --> 22:08.105
<i>Well, Jolene,
a round of specials, please...</i>

22:08.173 --> 22:13.543
and my third-wave emo punk here
is gonna get the check.

22:13.612 --> 22:15.546
Oh, that's just fantastic.

22:15.614 --> 22:18.310
I'm already paying the bill for the window,
might as well pay for breakfast.

22:18.384 --> 22:21.478
Thank you.

22:21.553 --> 22:26.422
Uh-oh. Looks like we brought
chum to the shark tank.

22:26.492 --> 22:29.859
Oh, that's romantic.
You're referring to us as piecemeal fish guts.

22:33.432 --> 22:35.593
<i>Look around. We're surrounded by trucker trash.</i>

22:35.668 --> 22:37.829
Just ignore 'em.
They're not bothering us.

22:37.903 --> 22:40.736
<i>- Okay?
- Of course they're not. They know their place.</i>

22:40.806 --> 22:44.298
<i>After all, truckers are just gacked-out speed
freaks whose only hope for companionship...</i>

22:44.376 --> 22:46.970
<i>is a disease-ridden hooker.</i>

22:47.046 --> 22:49.071
<i>Jesus, would you lower your voicel</i>

22:49.148 --> 22:53.744
I bet you I can get one of these convoy wack
jobs to flip their lid and storm out of here.

22:53.819 --> 22:56.219
Come on, gambler to gambler,
give me a chance to win my money back.

22:56.288 --> 23:00.224
You want a bet?
Here. Here's your bet.

23:00.292 --> 23:03.728
- I bet you you won't shut
the hell up for five minutes.
- Five minutes? Six.

23:03.796 --> 23:06.594
How about seven? Ten bucks?
Twenty?

23:10.135 --> 23:12.569
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

23:12.638 --> 23:16.074
You're not gonna cry, are you?

23:16.141 --> 23:19.008
Courtesy flush.

23:19.078 --> 23:22.070
We don't want this place
smelling like a truck stop.

23:30.189 --> 23:33.852
Um, ten bucks
if you guys make out.

23:41.467 --> 23:44.197
<i>And another special.</i>

23:44.269 --> 23:46.897
Oh, that's Bobby's.
Right here. Thank you.

23:56.482 --> 23:59.610
<i>So, you and Bobby can't
stay apart long enough...</i>

23:59.685 --> 24:01.744
to have separate
bachelor/bachelorette parties?

24:01.820 --> 24:04.288
<i>- That's pretty sad.
- Combo parties are in right now...</i>

24:04.356 --> 24:06.308
especially when the couple has the same friends.

24:06.517 --> 24:07.809
No, I'm not complaining.

24:07.826 --> 24:09.817
<i>Trust me. I think
it's pretty interesting.</i>

24:09.895 --> 24:12.728
I've always wanted to know what
goes on at a bachelorette bash.

24:12.798 --> 24:14.925
- Can I be the stripper?
- You okay, Mel?

24:23.075 --> 24:25.839
Why is Bobby taking so long?

24:25.911 --> 24:29.847
<i>Cupcake, when we're
together four years...</i>

24:29.915 --> 24:32.475
will you worry about me
when I'm out of your sight for 15 minutes?

24:32.551 --> 24:35.748
<i>Oh, I'll worry about you...
cheating on me.</i>

24:35.821 --> 24:38.415
<i>No, no, no. Give me a little
more credit than that.</i>

24:38.490 --> 24:41.015
<i>I plan on keeping my affairs
completely discreet.</i>

24:41.093 --> 24:43.323
- LikeJames Bond.
- How nice of you.

24:49.935 --> 24:54.235
- Hello?
- I believe you have something of mine.

24:54.306 --> 24:56.774
Shit. I think it's him.

24:56.842 --> 24:58.207
- Him who?
- The car.

24:58.277 --> 25:00.677
The car guy?

25:00.746 --> 25:04.182
- Goldilocks? You there?
- Uh-

25:04.249 --> 25:07.377
Goldilocks?

25:07.452 --> 25:10.683
<i>Didn't you come into my place
when I wasn't home...</i>

25:10.756 --> 25:14.055
just like Goldilocks
and the three bears.

25:14.126 --> 25:17.721
Uh, yes. We're really very sorry.

25:17.796 --> 25:22.324
We ran into an emergency, but we're bringing
the car back and money for any damages.

25:22.401 --> 25:25.700
<i>- That's why I left my number.
- No rush.</i>

25:25.771 --> 25:28.638
<i>No rush.</i>

25:28.707 --> 25:31.733
<i>Wouldn't want you
to worry one hair on that...</i>

25:31.810 --> 25:34.904
pretty blonde head of yours.

25:34.980 --> 25:37.540
How did you know
I was blonde?

25:37.616 --> 25:41.518
Lucky guess, Goldilocks.

25:43.856 --> 25:46.552
Yeah, a-a-anyway.

25:46.625 --> 25:49.355
<i>Um, okay.</i>

25:49.428 --> 25:53.592
Thank you for not going to the police.

25:53.665 --> 25:57.999
<i>Oh, I'd never do that.
I expect the same.</i>

25:59.972 --> 26:03.840
I don't understand.
Why would I go to the police?

26:06.745 --> 26:09.771
'Cause now I got
something of yours.

26:12.317 --> 26:13.944
Your boyfriend.

26:22.961 --> 26:25.759
Are they gonna have sex
in the bathroom?

26:25.831 --> 26:28.459
Bobby!

26:31.470 --> 26:34.633
Bobby! Bobby!

26:39.945 --> 26:42.709
Bobby!

26:42.781 --> 26:46.478
Bobby, where are you?

26:52.224 --> 26:54.886
Bobby, are you okay?

26:54.960 --> 26:57.485
<i>He can't come to the phone right now.</i>

26:57.562 --> 27:00.087
<i>He's a little... busy.</i>

27:03.068 --> 27:05.798
Why are you doing this?

27:05.871 --> 27:07.805
Only seems fair.

27:07.873 --> 27:11.832
I told you we were sorry about the car.
We didn't think anybody was home!

27:15.113 --> 27:17.775
<i>It's about more than just the car.</i>

27:17.849 --> 27:20.317
Please don't hurt him.

27:21.453 --> 27:24.081
Aw, too late for that now.

27:25.857 --> 27:27.848
I'm begging you.

27:31.196 --> 27:35.189
<i>You want to see him again?
Alive?</i>

27:35.267 --> 27:37.428
Of course!

27:37.502 --> 27:41.336
Then we got a long road ahead of us.

27:41.406 --> 27:46.275
There's just a couple of things
I'm gonna need you to do for me.

27:51.850 --> 27:55.445
He wants to talk
on some private station or something.

27:55.520 --> 27:57.579
- This is so fucked!
- Totally fucked!

27:57.656 --> 28:01.057
- I mean, who is this freak?
- Why would you leave your number?
Are you a complete idiot?

28:01.126 --> 28:02.889
I didn't want anyone going to the police!

28:02.961 --> 28:05.555
Just leave her alone, all right?
She was just being Mel.

28:05.630 --> 28:10.431
How do we know this guy's for real? How do we
know he's not punking us like some sick joke?

28:10.502 --> 28:13.903
Hello? Hello?
Is anybody out there?

28:16.041 --> 28:18.532
<i>Hello? Is anybody there?</i>

28:20.812 --> 28:22.643
<i>Goldilocks?</i>

28:22.714 --> 28:24.682
Yes. Yes, I'm here.

28:26.418 --> 28:28.886
Who are you?

28:29.888 --> 28:33.915
<i>You can call me... Rusty Nail.</i>

28:36.294 --> 28:38.626
Can I speak to Bobby?

28:41.033 --> 28:43.501
Please? L-

28:43.568 --> 28:46.162
I need to know that he's okay.

28:53.278 --> 28:56.509
Oh, my God. Bobby! Bobby!

28:56.581 --> 28:58.515
Okay. It's okay.

29:00.852 --> 29:03.377
<i>You do what I asked?</i>

29:06.758 --> 29:10.455
Yes.

29:12.364 --> 29:14.195
<i>I got the cell phones.</i>

29:14.266 --> 29:16.598
Line 'em up in front of the car.

29:16.668 --> 29:20.104
No way! I waited two days
in line for this phone.

29:20.172 --> 29:22.470
<i>Do it. Nowl</i>

29:25.377 --> 29:28.540
- No.
- Move!

29:28.613 --> 29:30.740
<i>- How's he gonna know if you do it or not?
- He's probably watching us.</i>

29:30.816 --> 29:34.946
How do you know he's watching us?
How do you know that?

29:40.125 --> 29:42.059
Okay.

29:42.127 --> 29:44.755
<i>Start the car and drive forward.</i>

29:46.198 --> 29:48.462
<i>Don't do it, Melissal
Don't do it, Melissa.</i>

29:48.533 --> 29:52.492
- I have to.
- If you do it now, he'll know
he can do anything he wants.

29:52.571 --> 29:55.472
This is fucking insane!

29:57.309 --> 29:59.607
Don't do it!

30:01.480 --> 30:03.778
Fuck!

30:08.920 --> 30:11.013
Okay, it's done.

30:11.089 --> 30:15.185
You follow everything I say
to the letter.

30:15.260 --> 30:19.924
You do that, I promise
you'll all be reunited soon.

30:19.998 --> 30:23.991
Don't get no ideas of
separatin' or goin' for help.

30:24.069 --> 30:26.799
<i>Okay.</i>

30:26.872 --> 30:30.171
We'll do whatever you want.
Whatever you want.

30:30.242 --> 30:33.939
- Jesus. Make sure you tickle
his balls while you're at it.
- Shut up, Nik!

30:34.012 --> 30:36.810
What do you want?

30:36.882 --> 30:42.218
Remember when your girlfriend
there threw her drink at my rig?

30:42.287 --> 30:46.690
That was him? He's one of them.
He's a fucking trucker!

30:46.758 --> 30:49.727
She gave me something,
right after that.

30:51.296 --> 30:53.457
<i>Ring any bells?</i>

30:55.267 --> 30:57.201
I don't understand.

30:57.269 --> 30:59.999
<i>She gave me the finger.</i>

31:02.974 --> 31:05.374
<i>Now I want it.</i>

31:05.443 --> 31:08.003
<i>She gave it to me,
I figure it's mine to keep.</i>

31:08.079 --> 31:11.105
What? My finger?

31:11.183 --> 31:14.311
<i>I'll let you know
the place and the time.</i>

31:14.386 --> 31:17.184
You just make sure
it's freshly cut.

31:18.456 --> 31:20.924
<i>And if you don't show up, well...</i>

31:20.992 --> 31:23.722
<i>things will not go well
for your boy here.</i>

31:26.765 --> 31:29.097
And, Goldilocks?

31:31.503 --> 31:33.437
Yes?

31:33.505 --> 31:35.837
I want you to bring it to me.

31:35.907 --> 31:38.603
<i>It's time we met...</i>

31:40.579 --> 31:42.570
in the flesh.

31:56.194 --> 31:58.458
I can't believe this is happening.

31:58.530 --> 32:01.226
I swear to God,
we're gonna find him.

32:01.299 --> 32:04.291
- We can figure this out.
How smart can this guy be?
- He said he had eyes everywhere.

32:04.369 --> 32:06.860
That's impossible.

32:06.938 --> 32:10.465
<i>I mean, he can use his C.B. to ask his fellow
road zombies if they've seen this car.</i>

32:10.542 --> 32:13.773
I mean, it's pretty unique. It's probably
how they found us in the first place.

32:13.845 --> 32:16.780
And he almost definitely has a police scanner,
so it means we can't go to the cops.

32:16.848 --> 32:20.113
- How do you know all this stuff?
- Dad used to be a trucker.

32:20.185 --> 32:22.710
Let's just say, not a fan.

32:26.224 --> 32:29.216
<i>- He could be in any one of them.
- It doesn't make sense for him to follow us...</i>

32:29.294 --> 32:32.161
<i>until we meet him in...</i>

32:32.230 --> 32:34.824
three hours, with
Kayla's severed finger.

32:34.899 --> 32:38.767
We are not cutting off
my sister's finger.

32:38.837 --> 32:42.432
My point is, is he's got to have something
to do between now and then.

32:42.507 --> 32:44.441
Otherwise, he would've asked us
for it right then and there, right?

32:44.509 --> 32:47.478
<i>- Okay.
- So, if he's not following us now...</i>

32:47.545 --> 32:52.107
and we stay away from trucks and police, maybe
we can find ourselves some time to maneuver.

32:52.183 --> 32:54.515
- He may be right.
- Thank you.

32:54.586 --> 32:57.919
- What if he's wrong?
- Hell, it's not my funeral.

32:57.989 --> 33:00.753
Hey, you know what? Why would
you say something like that?

33:00.825 --> 33:02.986
- Sorry.
- Just shut up!

33:06.398 --> 33:10.266
You know what? Maybe we
should just get him what he wants.

33:30.755 --> 33:34.623
- I'm not going in there.
- Nobody's asking you to.

33:34.693 --> 33:36.786
<i>I'll go. You know
I can handle blood.</i>

33:36.861 --> 33:39.295
No. You know what?
This is my fault.

33:39.364 --> 33:42.231
I gotta do this.

33:42.300 --> 33:45.463
- I need you to come with me.
- For what?

34:02.821 --> 34:05.312
Wait.

34:10.795 --> 34:12.728
Go wait with Mel.

35:09.554 --> 35:12.148
Fuck.

35:56.734 --> 35:59.862
What's with the whole
"okay with blood" thing?

35:59.938 --> 36:01.872
Forget about it, all right?

36:01.940 --> 36:04.636
No, seriously, you go to, like, med school,
or just a lot of P.M.S.

36:04.709 --> 36:08.042
What part of"forget about it"
is confusing you?

36:08.112 --> 36:10.137
Shit. Shit.

36:27.632 --> 36:29.793
- My God. Kayla. Kayla!
- Oh, shit.

36:34.639 --> 36:36.163
Shit.

36:36.241 --> 36:39.540
Oh, God.

36:39.611 --> 36:43.479
<i>Fuck, I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go.</i>

36:43.548 --> 36:45.675
Thank God.

36:55.159 --> 36:58.026
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

36:58.096 --> 37:00.656
I got a scalpel, too, just in case.

37:00.732 --> 37:02.700
- Great.
- Let's go.

37:02.767 --> 37:05.497
I'm in a fucking car
with a fucking finger.

37:05.570 --> 37:08.971
- Come on! Get in!
- It's fantastic, really.

37:11.609 --> 37:14.840
Oh, fuck! That's him!

37:14.913 --> 37:17.677
That's the guy.
He wants his finger back! That's the guy.

37:17.749 --> 37:20.274
<i>- He's coming for the fucking finger.
- I don't have the keys.</i>

37:20.351 --> 37:22.945
- I left them right here! I
don't know where the keys are.
- Let's go!

37:23.021 --> 37:26.286
Come on, man!

37:26.357 --> 37:28.987
You can't park here!
Police escort vehicles only!

37:28.988 --> 37:29.988
How many times do I have tell you?

37:30.061 --> 37:31.792
Sorry.
We're really sorry.

37:31.863 --> 37:34.093
We did-
It'll never happen again.

37:34.165 --> 37:37.191
<i>- Sir.
- Yeah, sorry. Sorry, Mr. Lurch.</i>

38:02.694 --> 38:05.356
<i>I'm not-I'm not so sure about this.</i>

38:05.430 --> 38:07.796
<i>Relax. Everything's gonna be fine.</i>

38:07.865 --> 38:12.234
Oh, great. Yeah, as long as we have the power
of positive thinking on our side.

38:12.303 --> 38:15.761
I think this is it.

38:21.846 --> 38:24.781
Stall him as long as you can.
Okay?

38:32.256 --> 38:34.417
You be careful, okay?

38:34.492 --> 38:36.892
Yeah.

39:01.219 --> 39:03.187
<i>Okay, I'm here.</i>

39:04.355 --> 39:08.553
Park about 50 feet away
from me, nose to nose.

39:22.040 --> 39:24.031
What now?

39:25.410 --> 39:27.401
<i>Get out of the car.</i>

39:28.413 --> 39:31.211
<i>Then come around the front...</i>

39:32.383 --> 39:34.374
and strip for me.

39:36.220 --> 39:38.450
<i>Down to your underwear.</i>

39:38.523 --> 39:42.459
<i>Gotta make sure you're not wearing
a weapon and a wire, now don't I?</i>

39:42.527 --> 39:46.588
Please don't make me do this.

39:46.664 --> 39:48.859
I'm not wearing anything.

39:48.933 --> 39:53.495
- I'm losing my patience.
- Okay! Okay, okay.

39:53.571 --> 39:55.562
I'll- I'll do whatever you say.

39:57.308 --> 40:00.766
<i>At my signal,
come up to the cab...</i>

40:00.845 --> 40:03.336
<i>and give me what's mine.</i>

40:04.549 --> 40:07.575
And then you'll let Bobby go?

40:07.652 --> 40:11.088
<i>You do what I say...</i>

40:11.155 --> 40:13.589
<i>and I promise
you'll see him again.</i>

40:15.927 --> 40:18.657
Do it now.

40:18.730 --> 40:21.392
<i>And, Goldilocks?</i>

40:21.466 --> 40:23.661
Make it slow.

40:24.669 --> 40:27.661
<i>I want to enjoy this.</i>

40:42.353 --> 40:46.449
<i>Now why don't you show me that
pretty little ring of yours?</i>

42:46.077 --> 42:50.537
- Oh, this is so messed up.
- Just keep moving.

42:50.615 --> 42:53.140
I don't remember reading
any of this shit on your user profile.

42:53.217 --> 42:57.779
- Are you serious? Just shut up!
- I'm sorry.

42:57.855 --> 43:00.756
L- I get nervous,
I tend to talk a lot.

43:13.671 --> 43:17.471
Whoo-wee! That is the finest
striptease I ever did see!

43:17.541 --> 43:20.374
I'm gonna throw this up
on YouTube, get me a million hits.

43:20.444 --> 43:24.710
- Who are you?
- Whoever you want, sexy mama.

43:24.782 --> 43:28.479
Close them pretty eyes and pretend
I'm Kenny Chesney for all I care.

43:29.654 --> 43:32.748
Oh, my God.
You're not him?

43:34.759 --> 43:39.458
- Where's Bobby?
- Bobby? What the high heck you talking about?

43:39.530 --> 43:42.988
<i>All's I know is some road dawg came over the
squawk, told me that I'd get quite a show...</i>

43:43.067 --> 43:45.729
if I pulled over
at this here chicken coop.

43:45.803 --> 43:48.670
And, missy, let me tell you,
that did not disappoint one bit.

43:48.739 --> 43:52.072
- Bobby!
- Bobby! Bobby!

43:52.143 --> 43:55.943
- Why are you doing this?
- Goddamn it! Didn't warn me
you was no psycho she-bitch.

43:56.013 --> 43:57.844
I'm out of here!

43:57.915 --> 44:00.679
<i>Your titties
are too small anywaysl</i>

44:00.751 --> 44:03.948
I like them super mongo jugs.

44:04.021 --> 44:06.512
Yeah, you heard me.
Circus boobs!

44:09.093 --> 44:12.324
What was that?

44:12.396 --> 44:15.092
Roll!

44:25.409 --> 44:28.776
I don't understand.
I did everything you asked!

44:31.716 --> 44:33.343
<i>No, you didn't.</i>

44:33.417 --> 44:38.286
- I saw you down at the funeral parlor.
- Mel, what is going on?

44:38.356 --> 44:42.884
<i>There's a big difference between
a freshly cut, live finger...</i>

44:42.960 --> 44:46.327
<i>and one snipped from a corpse.</i>

44:46.397 --> 44:48.331
Less blood in that one
you got there.

44:49.567 --> 44:52.297
Stiffer, paler.

44:52.370 --> 44:54.361
<i>The nail's yellowed...</i>

44:54.438 --> 44:58.568
<i>no nutrients, deterioratin'.</i>

44:58.642 --> 45:02.840
Want to see what
a fresh one looks like?

45:02.913 --> 45:05.040
Check the glove compartment.

45:41.352 --> 45:43.286
Told you you'd see him again.

45:44.488 --> 45:46.718
<i>I just didn't say
which part ofhim.</i>

45:46.791 --> 45:51.854
<i>Your boy's losing a lot ofblood here.</i>

45:51.929 --> 45:54.557
<i>Maybe I should take
care of that for him.</i>

45:54.632 --> 45:56.759
No. No, no.

46:02.440 --> 46:05.534
No!

46:12.650 --> 46:14.618
What the fuck do you want?

46:23.561 --> 46:26.086
We're not finished, Goldilocks.

46:26.163 --> 46:28.961
<i>Not by a long shot.</i>

46:30.334 --> 46:33.599
Heck of a joyride, isn't it?

46:39.877 --> 46:43.074
<i>Okay. So, uh, maybe- maybe now
we should go to the cops.</i>

46:43.147 --> 46:45.775
What are they gonna do?
Put out an all-points bulletin?

46:45.850 --> 46:48.785
<i>Set up roadblocks?
Rull over every big rig in Utah?</i>

46:48.853 --> 46:51.447
- That's a damn good start.
- He's monitoring the police bands.

46:51.522 --> 46:55.515
- He'll know the second we try to get help.
- No. No police. Absolutely not.

46:55.593 --> 46:58.255
- What the fuck do you want to do then?
- Whatever he asks!

47:00.030 --> 47:05.491
Next time, for sure we do exactly
what he asks, no matter what it is.

47:07.571 --> 47:09.664
This is so fucked up.

47:26.123 --> 47:28.182
You alive, boy?

47:28.259 --> 47:30.887
Don't do anything stupid.

47:38.903 --> 47:41.371
<i>Just goin'out for a minute.</i>

48:08.132 --> 48:11.624
Sorry, hoss, but you got to be a member
to enter a bar in Utah.

48:15.439 --> 48:18.306
<i>#Singin'my song to you #</i>

48:19.376 --> 48:22.038
All right. But be quick.

48:23.347 --> 48:25.406
Dick.

48:38.529 --> 48:42.192
# I don't have to change no more #

48:42.266 --> 48:44.200
# No, I can't #

48:44.268 --> 48:48.728
Help me! Help me!

48:51.008 --> 48:55.206
# Singin' my song to you
ain't gonna pay my bills ##

48:55.279 --> 48:57.213
Help!

49:09.226 --> 49:12.195
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about.

49:16.033 --> 49:18.627
Help!

49:18.702 --> 49:20.863
What the fuck?

49:26.010 --> 49:28.843
<i>Helpl</i>

49:28.912 --> 49:31.745
What's going on in there?

49:31.815 --> 49:33.840
- Help me!
- Holy fuck!

49:33.917 --> 49:35.851
Open the door!

49:35.919 --> 49:38.649
Hey, you hold on in there, buddy.
I'll get you out of here.

49:38.722 --> 49:40.587
<i>Damn thing, it won't openl</i>

49:40.658 --> 49:43.354
- No!
- I can't open the damn door!

49:51.268 --> 49:55.261
Oh, my God.

50:06.617 --> 50:10.018
Did you see
the way his jaw dropped?

50:14.124 --> 50:18.618
You like taking chances, huh?

50:18.696 --> 50:22.325
Well, then I got a game for you.

50:34.445 --> 50:36.470
Rusty, can you hear me?

50:39.616 --> 50:43.814
<i>Rusty, please talk to me.</i>

50:43.887 --> 50:46.879
<i>Rusty, please talk to me.</i>

50:46.957 --> 50:49.983
<i>It's been over an hour. Maybe he's, um-</i>

50:50.060 --> 50:53.223
Well, maybe it's over.
Maybe he's, you know, already dead.

50:53.297 --> 50:56.755
Shut up, Nik.
So much cooler over the Internet.

50:56.834 --> 50:59.268
Yeah, so were you.

50:59.336 --> 51:00.826
<i>Goldilocks?</i>

51:00.904 --> 51:03.566
Y- Yes, Rusty.
Rusty, I'm here.

51:03.640 --> 51:07.076
<i>Look, I'm-I'm sorry...</i>

51:07.144 --> 51:11.740
about what we did to you,
deceiving you like that.

51:11.815 --> 51:14.750
<i>It won't happen again.
Just please-</i>

51:14.818 --> 51:16.752
<i>please let me talk to Bobby.</i>

51:18.355 --> 51:22.223
I'm tired. Real tired.

51:23.293 --> 51:25.591
Been gone a long time.

51:27.097 --> 51:30.362
<i>I was heading home, you know.</i>

51:30.434 --> 51:34.063
Planning on staying
off the road for a while.

51:34.138 --> 51:36.299
Hibernatin'.

51:36.373 --> 51:39.740
<i>Like a bear, huh, Goldilocks?</i>

51:39.810 --> 51:42.176
Rusty, please-

51:42.246 --> 51:44.874
please let me talk to Bobby.

51:44.948 --> 51:47.940
<i>I love him more than...</i>

51:48.018 --> 51:51.112
<i>anything in the world.</i>

51:51.188 --> 51:55.090
<i>And we're getting married.</i>

51:55.159 --> 51:57.787
<i>Bobby, if you can hear me,
I love you.</i>

51:57.861 --> 52:00.386
<i>I love you so much.</i>

52:01.665 --> 52:04.156
<i>I need you to get something for me.</i>

52:06.203 --> 52:08.137
Anything you want.

52:09.206 --> 52:14.075
Some high-speed chicken feed.

52:15.679 --> 52:18.648
- I don't know what that is.
- It's crank.

52:20.317 --> 52:23.013
It's trucker speak
for crystal meth.

52:23.086 --> 52:25.850
What, now we're drug mules?
Fuck!

52:25.923 --> 52:28.585
We're just gonna do
whatever he says.

52:28.659 --> 52:31.628
Yeah. You know what? I'm just glad
it doesn't involve a fucking body part!

52:31.695 --> 52:35.995
<i>I think it's about time for y'all
to take a walk on the wild side.</i>

52:43.941 --> 52:45.841
Get in.

53:00.724 --> 53:03.215
<i>#It's 2:00 in the morning
My baby's in bed #</i>

53:06.630 --> 53:10.896
<i>Not exactly my scene, but I respect
their right to peaceful assembly.</i>

53:10.968 --> 53:13.300
Go, go, go, go, go!

53:13.370 --> 53:16.305
Or not so peaceful.

53:16.373 --> 53:19.035
All right, Rusty, we're here.

53:19.109 --> 53:21.703
What now?

53:21.778 --> 53:24.474
<i>Check the trunk.</i>

53:29.419 --> 53:31.649
Fuck if I'm doing it.

54:04.688 --> 54:06.679
What the hell?

54:10.160 --> 54:13.027
<i>Did you get it, Goldilocks?</i>

54:16.700 --> 54:19.897
What is this?

54:19.970 --> 54:23.133
<i>Well, that's what the tattooed
boy's gonna wear.</i>

54:23.206 --> 54:24.935
Oh, no fucking way.

54:26.777 --> 54:29.371
<i>I want him to walk through this party...</i>

54:29.446 --> 54:33.473
<i>Iookin'like
a disease-ridden lot lizard.</i>

54:33.550 --> 54:37.543
<i>That's all us gacked-out,
speed-freak truckers can get...</i>

54:37.621 --> 54:41.284
<i>so that's exactly what
he's gonna do for me.</i>

54:41.358 --> 54:43.588
<i>Oh, my God. He was there.</i>

54:43.660 --> 54:47.255
He heard everything. He was in the diner.
He heard everything you said!

54:47.331 --> 54:49.595
- Way to go, Tattooboy2000!
- Shut up!

54:49.666 --> 54:52.829
Take it easy, Finger Queen. You didn't exactly
ingratiate yourself to him either!

54:52.903 --> 54:54.427
Shut up!

54:56.073 --> 54:58.940
<i>You're a gambler, aren't you, boy?</i>

54:59.009 --> 55:03.537
What's the odds you can stay out there
long enough to bring me what I want?

55:03.614 --> 55:06.845
Zero! 'Cause it's not
fucking happening!

55:06.917 --> 55:10.318
Want me to go out there
dressed like a fucking tranny?

55:12.022 --> 55:14.149
They'll kill me.
Not doing it.

55:14.224 --> 55:16.158
Oh, you're doing it.

55:20.530 --> 55:24.466
- I'm not doin' it.
- Yes. You are.

55:24.534 --> 55:27.367
<i>- Excuse me?
- You're gonna go out there...</i>

55:27.437 --> 55:30.270
<i>and you're gonna do everything
he asks to the letter...</i>

55:30.340 --> 55:34.174
'cause Bobby's life
depends on it.

55:34.244 --> 55:36.769
- Fuck you.
- Hey, know what, Nik?

55:36.847 --> 55:39.145
<i>Fuck you too.
Most of all, fuck himl</i>

55:41.018 --> 55:44.215
<i>Fuckl What the fuck are you doing, bitch?</i>

55:44.287 --> 55:47.916
You are not going anywhere.

55:52.195 --> 55:56.723
I don't even know why I stayed around this long.
I barely know you or your boyfriend.

55:58.301 --> 56:02.067
And, you,
I'm sorry, but you're just not worth it.

56:02.139 --> 56:05.074
<i>From now on, this is between
you guys and Rusty Dickhole.</i>

56:06.076 --> 56:08.840
Good night and good luck.

56:10.447 --> 56:14.383
<i>You're not gonna have to
worry about Rusty anymore, Nik...</i>

56:14.451 --> 56:16.419
'cause right now
I'm your fucking problem.

56:16.486 --> 56:18.920
<i>Mel? Mel.</i>

56:18.989 --> 56:22.152
I am not gonna let you
jeopardize Bobby's life.

56:22.225 --> 56:25.160
Mel, I think you have to calm down.

56:25.228 --> 56:27.162
<i>Mel, give me the scalpel.</i>

56:27.230 --> 56:29.164
I'm sorry.

56:29.232 --> 56:33.430
I will do whatever
it takes to save him.

56:33.503 --> 56:35.664
'Cause Bobby is worth it.

56:40.610 --> 56:42.703
I can't go out there
dressed like a fucking tranny.

56:42.779 --> 56:45.077
<i>I can't do that.
They'll kill me.</i>

56:45.148 --> 56:48.276
Please don't make me do this.
I just want to go home. I just-

56:48.351 --> 56:50.285
Please.

56:50.353 --> 56:53.618
<i>- You're not much of a tough guy now, huh?
- Please.</i>

56:53.690 --> 56:55.885
All tattooed and pierced.

56:55.959 --> 56:57.586
They're fake. Lookit.

56:57.661 --> 57:01.392
<i>They're fucking fakel
They're fakel</i>

57:01.465 --> 57:03.763
You're a little
fucking douche bag!

57:06.369 --> 57:09.896
<i>Rlease. Rlease.</i>

57:09.973 --> 57:13.670
<i>Listen to me, Nik.
We're going to make sure...</i>

57:13.744 --> 57:15.678
that you pass as a girl.

57:15.746 --> 57:18.271
<i>- Oh, that won't be a problem.
- You're gonna go out there...</i>

57:18.348 --> 57:23.251
<i>you're gonna get some speed from some dirt ball
too wasted to even know the difference...</i>

57:23.320 --> 57:26.915
and everything's
gonna run smoothly, okay?

57:37.601 --> 57:40.331
Okay.

57:40.403 --> 57:45.067
Goldilocks, you out there?

57:45.142 --> 57:49.078
<i>You better not bail on us.
'Cause I'll call you out on it so damn fast.</i>

57:49.146 --> 57:52.445
I said I'd fucking do it!
Okay?

57:52.516 --> 57:56.748
<i>How's my little hussy?</i>

58:00.190 --> 58:02.988
We're just finishing
some final touches.

58:21.978 --> 58:27.439
<i>#Monkey-doin'woman
Mr. Shy Guy's back in town #</i>

58:31.087 --> 58:36.354
<i>#Monkey-doin'woman
Mr. Shy Guy's back in town #</i>

58:39.429 --> 58:42.398
<i># Well, I'm a monkey-doin'man #</i>

58:52.776 --> 58:54.835
We should follow him.

58:55.879 --> 58:59.838
No. We can't leave this car.

58:59.916 --> 59:03.352
He didn't say anything to us
about staying put this time, right?

59:03.420 --> 59:06.321
I mean,
this could be a trap.

59:12.929 --> 59:17.229
Hey! Come on over, sexy lady!

59:17.300 --> 59:19.894
Hey, you want some of this, huh?

59:19.970 --> 59:22.530
<i>- Does any-
- You want a real man behind you?</i>

59:22.606 --> 59:26.269
<i>- Does anybody have any meth?
- You like it like that?</i>

59:44.995 --> 59:46.963
<i>Rusty's here, Mel.</i>

59:47.030 --> 59:50.830
<i>He is. A nd we have to
try to find out who he is...</i>

59:50.901 --> 59:53.802
what his truck looks like, where he might be
keeping Bobby, something.

59:53.870 --> 59:57.237
He said that if we followed
everything that he told us-

59:57.307 --> 59:59.468
<i>He would reunite us.
Which really only means...</i>

59:59.542 --> 01:00:03.603
if we keep following his demands,
we're all gonna end up dead.

01:00:08.652 --> 01:00:11.621
Does anybody have any crystal?

01:00:11.688 --> 01:00:15.886
Hey, sweet tits!
I got what you're lookin' for.

01:00:15.959 --> 01:00:20.828
Maybe we can work somethin' out
in trade, huh?

01:00:20.897 --> 01:00:23.127
I'm sorry. No- No, thanks.

01:00:24.401 --> 01:00:27.427
Why are you
running away from me?

01:00:31.374 --> 01:00:33.171
Fuck.

01:00:48.358 --> 01:00:50.485
- Oh, shit!
- You can't-

01:00:54.764 --> 01:00:56.527
Oh, my God! Shit!

01:00:58.702 --> 01:01:01.967
Oh, my God!

01:01:02.038 --> 01:01:04.006
Hey, little girl.

01:01:06.042 --> 01:01:08.977
Nik! Nik!

01:01:09.045 --> 01:01:11.013
No! Get back in the car!

01:01:16.619 --> 01:01:20.453
<i>Back to the carl
We gotta chase himl</i>

01:01:33.903 --> 01:01:35.894
- That fuck head!
- We can't follow him!

01:01:35.972 --> 01:01:38.406
He's gonna kill Bobby,
and then he's gonna kill us!

01:01:38.475 --> 01:01:40.807
This is our one chance.

01:01:41.878 --> 01:01:44.745
<i>- He's taunting us.
- Kayla, please.</i>

01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:06.027
Where did he go?

01:02:06.102 --> 01:02:08.036
I don't see him.

01:02:17.947 --> 01:02:19.073
Oh, my God! Go!

01:02:29.959 --> 01:02:31.620
Oh, my God!

01:02:37.133 --> 01:02:38.361
Fuck!

01:02:45.942 --> 01:02:47.603
What?

01:02:51.014 --> 01:02:52.879
I can't- Okay.

01:02:54.350 --> 01:02:56.580
I can't go any faster!

01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:09.291
Oh, my God!

01:03:09.365 --> 01:03:11.458
No!

01:04:41.257 --> 01:04:43.191
Mel.

01:04:45.495 --> 01:04:47.554
Mel, can you hear me?

01:04:49.265 --> 01:04:51.199
<i>Mel?</i>

01:04:51.267 --> 01:04:53.758
Oh, thank God.

01:04:53.836 --> 01:04:57.294
I'm gonna-
I'm gonna get you out of here.

01:05:07.517 --> 01:05:09.678
I'll get you out of here.

01:05:27.804 --> 01:05:31.103
You have to wait until the last moment
to jump, okay?

01:05:32.175 --> 01:05:34.200
What are you talking about?

01:05:34.277 --> 01:05:38.646
If you time it right, he won't be able
to see you from this angle.

01:05:38.715 --> 01:05:40.580
You have to go.

01:05:40.650 --> 01:05:42.140
Oh, my God.

01:05:44.687 --> 01:05:46.985
Go. Go. Come on. Get up.

01:05:49.459 --> 01:05:51.393
Come on.

01:05:54.497 --> 01:05:56.465
That's good.

01:05:57.567 --> 01:06:00.434
Okay. I gotta
get you out of here.

01:06:00.503 --> 01:06:04.337
Sis. Sis.

01:06:04.407 --> 01:06:07.968
My leg's pinned.

01:06:08.044 --> 01:06:10.512
I'm not going anywhere.

01:06:15.218 --> 01:06:17.413
- You have to go.
- I'm not.

01:06:17.487 --> 01:06:19.853
- You have to go.
- I'm not going.

01:06:21.758 --> 01:06:25.194
Promise me you'll finish this.

01:06:25.261 --> 01:06:27.195
I promise.

01:08:34.823 --> 01:08:38.260
What the fuck's going on?
Where are we?

01:08:38.327 --> 01:08:41.057
<i>Where it all started.</i>

01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:46.461
<i>Where I can
take my time with you.</i>

01:08:53.709 --> 01:08:57.304
<i>Couple ofbig-time risk takers, huh?</i>

01:08:57.380 --> 01:08:59.404
Pl-Pl-Please let us go.

01:09:00.582 --> 01:09:04.144
You like to gamble?

01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:07.553
Like to take chances?

01:09:07.622 --> 01:09:11.252
- You like to steal cars?
- It wasn't my idea!

01:09:11.327 --> 01:09:13.852
Come on, please.
I'll do anything you want.

01:09:13.930 --> 01:09:17.491
- Nik, stop talking.
- Anything, I mean it. Sky's the limit, man.

01:09:17.567 --> 01:09:20.263
Shut up!

01:09:20.336 --> 01:09:23.930
Stop talking.

01:09:25.241 --> 01:09:27.937
What's your favorite game?

01:09:32.615 --> 01:09:35.106
- Or you prefer I complete your transformation?
- No, no, no!

01:09:35.184 --> 01:09:38.881
Stop, stop!

01:09:38.955 --> 01:09:42.447
<i>I said,
what's your favorite game?</i>

01:09:44.426 --> 01:09:47.453
Craps! Craps!

01:09:47.529 --> 01:09:51.990
Good one. Nice odds.

01:09:52.068 --> 01:09:54.400
I got my own favorite game.

01:09:55.605 --> 01:09:57.539
You want to play?

01:09:59.742 --> 01:10:01.733
You're up first.

01:10:05.715 --> 01:10:07.649
- What do you want me to do?
- Roll!

01:10:20.096 --> 01:10:22.428
<i>Five.</i>

01:10:26.969 --> 01:10:29.403
<i>- Kneecap.
- Fuck.</i>

01:10:33.276 --> 01:10:35.904
No!

01:10:49.625 --> 01:10:51.616
Your turn.

01:10:54.630 --> 01:10:57.861
How do you want me
to do the other leg?

01:11:17.353 --> 01:11:19.446
<i>Seven.</i>

01:11:21.524 --> 01:11:24.550
Safe. Lucky you.

01:11:24.627 --> 01:11:27.596
Again.

01:11:27.663 --> 01:11:30.655
I don't want to play anymore.

01:11:30.733 --> 01:11:34.134
I don't like repeating myself!

01:11:34.203 --> 01:11:36.228
Ow!

01:11:36.305 --> 01:11:40.139
They're-They're-
They're-They're fake. Sorry.

01:11:40.209 --> 01:11:42.109
Roll.

01:11:57.927 --> 01:12:00.293
<i>Four. Chest.</i>

01:12:07.470 --> 01:12:09.734
What is he doing?

01:12:13.009 --> 01:12:15.637
<i>- Oh, shit.
- What is he doing?</i>

01:12:15.711 --> 01:12:18.271
I'm so sorry.

01:12:23.519 --> 01:12:26.818
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:12:30.559 --> 01:12:34.359
Help! Help!

01:13:00.056 --> 01:13:02.149
Help!

01:13:16.706 --> 01:13:20.437
<i>Come on, lover boy.
It's just a game.</i>

01:13:20.509 --> 01:13:22.067
Stay with me now.

01:13:26.916 --> 01:13:28.884
I can't do this.

01:13:28.951 --> 01:13:31.317
Roll.

01:13:35.991 --> 01:13:38.516
I said roll!

01:13:41.697 --> 01:13:45.599
<i>Rlease, don't.</i>

01:13:45.668 --> 01:13:47.602
Don't. Bobby, don't.

01:13:53.409 --> 01:13:55.502
<i>Rlease, don't.</i>

01:13:59.548 --> 01:14:03.416
Uh-oh. Double ones.

01:14:03.486 --> 01:14:05.420
Somebody just crapped out.

01:14:06.522 --> 01:14:08.786
What does that mean?

01:14:08.858 --> 01:14:12.658
What does that mean?

01:14:12.728 --> 01:14:16.289
- Look familiar?
- Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

01:14:18.334 --> 01:14:20.268
You wanted to use this
on me, didn't ya?

01:14:20.336 --> 01:14:22.327
You were trying to kill us.

01:14:22.404 --> 01:14:24.770
<i>Now, didn't you ever hear...</i>

01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:27.331
two wrongs just
don't make a right?

01:14:35.084 --> 01:14:36.676
Where are you?

01:14:43.492 --> 01:14:45.858
Nik, look at me.

01:14:47.029 --> 01:14:49.122
Help me.

01:14:53.035 --> 01:14:55.196
Where the fuck are you?

01:14:55.271 --> 01:14:58.138
- Where is he?
- Look at me.

01:14:58.207 --> 01:15:00.072
Where is he? Please?

01:15:00.142 --> 01:15:03.634
<i>I'm here. Don't you worry.</i>

01:15:04.847 --> 01:15:07.816
Right behind you.

01:17:10.306 --> 01:17:12.706
Well, there you go.

01:17:12.775 --> 01:17:16.643
Just you and me now.
You're the only one left.

01:17:16.712 --> 01:17:18.646
Oh, God, Melissa.

01:17:18.714 --> 01:17:21.114
Yeah. She's dead too.

01:17:23.085 --> 01:17:25.485
It's a damn shame.

01:17:25.554 --> 01:17:28.250
I was having fun.

01:18:12.501 --> 01:18:15.800
Why are you doing this?

01:18:15.871 --> 01:18:19.830
I want you to feel what it's like to have
something taken away from you.

01:18:19.908 --> 01:18:22.138
You took everything from me!

01:18:22.211 --> 01:18:25.271
Not everything.

01:18:25.347 --> 01:18:27.281
Not yet.

01:18:28.317 --> 01:18:31.047
It was only a car.

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:34.351
It may get a little bouncy back here.

01:18:34.423 --> 01:18:36.823
You be sure to hang on tight.

01:18:56.512 --> 01:18:58.742
Don't go doing anything clever.

01:19:34.416 --> 01:19:36.646
Son of a bitch!

01:19:36.718 --> 01:19:39.243
- Melissa!
- Bobby?

01:19:39.321 --> 01:19:42.085
<i>Melissal</i>

01:19:42.157 --> 01:19:45.490
Bobby! Bobby, are you there?

01:19:45.561 --> 01:19:47.552
<i>Melissa!</i>

01:19:47.629 --> 01:19:51.497
- Are you all right?
- Shut the power to the trailer.

01:19:51.567 --> 01:19:54.627
<i>- What?
- Shut the power to the trailerl</i>

01:19:54.703 --> 01:19:58.332
It's in the cab. Get the truck
and take us out of here.

01:20:52.694 --> 01:20:54.286
<i>Bobbyl</i>

01:20:54.363 --> 01:20:56.957
<i>Melissa, gol</i>

01:21:39.107 --> 01:21:43.100
We need help. Is anyone there?
Send the police. Exit 57 West.

01:22:42.504 --> 01:22:44.631
Where are you,
you son of bitch?

01:23:14.202 --> 01:23:16.033
Goldilocks.

01:25:31.173 --> 01:25:33.141
<i>Is it over?</i>

01:25:41.183 --> 01:25:43.117
It is now.

01:26:03.438 --> 01:26:05.633
<i>Shitl</i>

01:26:05.707 --> 01:26:07.937
<i>Come on, come on, come on.</i>

01:26:11.646 --> 01:26:14.945
Shit!

01:26:17.352 --> 01:26:20.515
Of course.

01:26:28.930 --> 01:26:31.524
Hey! Help!

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:34.160
Help!

01:26:34.236 --> 01:26:36.227
Asshole.

01:26:56.858 --> 01:26:59.292
My car won't start.

01:26:59.361 --> 01:27:01.989
<i>Get in.</i>

01:27:13.441 --> 01:27:15.375
<i>You'll catch your death out there.</i>
