-Listen.

10:05.472 --> 10:08.907
"Listen"!

10:08.909 --> 10:12.377
That was clear as day,
"listen," in a woman's voice.

10:14.614 --> 10:18.516
We're going to keep going up.

10:18.518 --> 10:20.952
Do you know where they were
killed in the house?

10:20.954 --> 10:22.120
-Yeah, the lady --
-...basement...

10:22.122 --> 10:23.288
-Whoa!
-Whoa.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.956
"I'm in the basement"
or something.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.359
Do you know where they were
killed in the house?

10:27.361 --> 10:28.960
-Yeah, the lady --
-...basement...

10:28.962 --> 10:30.228
-Yeah, the lady --
-...basement...

10:30.230 --> 10:31.296
-Whoa!
-Whoa.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.831
"I'm in the basement"
or something.

10:32.833 --> 10:39.671
¶¶

10:39.673 --> 10:42.407
ZAK: Back at the carriage house,
we do a live review

10:42.409 --> 10:44.709
to see if we captured any EVPs

10:44.711 --> 10:47.746
before the freezing cold energy
made contact.

10:47.748 --> 10:50.382
<i>Can you make a noise</i>
<i>up there if you hear me,</i>

10:50.384 --> 10:52.350
<i>if you understand me?</i>

10:52.352 --> 10:53.952
<i>[ Knocks ]</i>

10:53.954 --> 10:56.688
<i>Can you do that?</i>
<i>I heard three barks.</i>

10:56.690 --> 10:58.023
<i>-[ Indistinct voice ]</i>
<i>-You hear that?</i>

10:58.025 --> 10:59.257
-What was that?
-What the hell?

10:59.259 --> 11:01.326
-That's a voice. That's a voice.
-Hold on.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.094
<i>...if you understand me?</i>

11:03.096 --> 11:05.864
<i>Can you do that?</i>
<i>I heard three barks.</i>

11:05.866 --> 11:07.399
<i>-Behind you.</i>
<i>-You hear that?</i>

11:07.401 --> 11:08.633
"Behind you."

11:08.635 --> 11:09.868
-Yes.
-Listen. Listen.

11:09.870 --> 11:12.303
<i>Can you do that?</i>
<i>I heard three barks.</i>

11:12.305 --> 11:14.139
<i>-Behind you.</i>
<i>-You hear that?</i>

11:14.141 --> 11:15.907
-"Behind you."
-Dude, yeah. It's clear.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.442
Hey, that's really clear.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.377
<i>Behind you.</i>

11:19.379 --> 11:21.946
That was a really
good voice.

11:21.948 --> 11:24.616
I think there's good here,
and I think there's bad here.

11:24.618 --> 11:26.584
Oh, gosh.
Oh, I got chills.

11:26.586 --> 11:28.553
Her head was decapitated.

11:32.201 --> 11:36.570
¶¶

11:36.572 --> 11:39.072
ZAK: It's day 2 of our
investigation.

11:39.074 --> 11:41.208
We had a lot of things
happen last night,

11:41.210 --> 11:44.478
and the coolest part about this
is that we had a professor

11:44.480 --> 11:47.815
of a university validate
and witness these events.

11:47.817 --> 11:51.752
I felt this cold energy
start coming down.

11:51.754 --> 11:53.654
-Do you feel this?
-Yeah, I did.

11:53.656 --> 11:55.255
ZAK: I invite Rich and Bob

11:55.257 --> 11:57.391
to listen to the powerful
audio evidence

11:57.393 --> 11:59.493
we collected on day 1.

11:59.495 --> 12:01.261
Rich, good to see you again.
Bob, how you doing?

12:01.263 --> 12:02.596
All right.

12:02.598 --> 12:04.264
So, listen, I had some
really incredible experiences,

12:04.266 --> 12:05.466
especially with you.

12:05.468 --> 12:08.869
I just felt an ice-cold air
on my left elbow again,

12:08.871 --> 12:10.571
my left arm right here.

12:10.573 --> 12:13.040
What I felt there, Rich,
was a very,

12:13.042 --> 12:15.075
very powerful
experience for me.

12:15.077 --> 12:17.811
I know that that was
a spirit there with us,

12:17.813 --> 12:21.648
and I do believe that
this is your friend, Wanda,

12:21.650 --> 12:24.418
but I think there's good here,
and I think there's bad here.

12:24.420 --> 12:25.853
Do you both agree?

12:25.855 --> 12:27.588
-Oh, yes.
-Oh, definitely.

12:29.592 --> 12:32.426
We went in here, and we
experienced something

12:32.428 --> 12:33.994
come down the stairs.

12:33.996 --> 12:36.864
We felt it.
We documented that it had

12:36.866 --> 12:39.132
electromagnetic energy
within it.

12:39.134 --> 12:41.134
Look. It went to yellow.
I'm telling you.

12:41.136 --> 12:42.703
Oh, blue, blue, blue.

12:42.705 --> 12:44.104
Oh, my God.
It's red.

12:44.106 --> 12:45.939
-It's right here.
-It's red.

12:45.941 --> 12:49.276
And then, whatever this was
spoke to us

12:49.278 --> 12:51.044
on a digital recorder.

12:51.046 --> 12:52.846
So I want to play
this voice for you,

12:52.848 --> 12:56.617
and I want to see if
this voice resonates within you.

12:56.619 --> 12:59.253
<i>Can you do that?</i>
<i>I heard three barks.</i>

12:59.255 --> 13:01.421
<i>-Behind you.</i>
<i>-Did you hear that?</i>

13:01.423 --> 13:03.190
I did.
I got that. "Behind you."

13:03.192 --> 13:06.426
Boom.
That is called a Class A EVP.

13:06.428 --> 13:08.428
When you play an EVP
for somebody,

13:08.430 --> 13:10.397
you don't tell them
what it says,

13:10.399 --> 13:13.333
and they get it
the very first play.

13:13.335 --> 13:14.535
Wow.

13:14.537 --> 13:16.837
This is how we get answers
of the afterlife,

13:16.839 --> 13:20.874
by this type of evidence.

13:20.876 --> 13:22.676
So, listen,
we're losing light,

13:22.678 --> 13:24.077
but I really need
to take you guys

13:24.079 --> 13:26.280
over really quick with me
over to the Murder House.

13:26.282 --> 13:28.015
I got Billy over there
waiting for us.

13:28.017 --> 13:30.250
He's going to show us
a little bit more of audio.

13:30.252 --> 13:33.887
¶¶

13:33.889 --> 13:36.857
ZAK: Billy has isolated
the voice that Aaron captured

13:36.859 --> 13:39.293
on the Spirit Box
in the Murder House.

13:39.295 --> 13:41.728
BILLY: Tell me if you can hear
this voice right here.

13:41.730 --> 13:43.430
<i>-Look.</i>
<i>-Listen.</i>

13:43.432 --> 13:46.433
Right after he said, "Look,"
a voice came through.

13:46.435 --> 13:48.435
<i>-Look.</i>
<i>-Listen.</i>

13:48.437 --> 13:50.170
-The woman's voice is --
-Do you hear the "listen"?

13:50.172 --> 13:53.473
She's saying, "Listen," and I
think it's to give us a message,

13:53.475 --> 13:56.510
in which you will hear some more
clear things come through here,

13:56.512 --> 13:58.612
which I think she
might be telling us.

13:58.614 --> 14:01.915
So a little bit later, you hear
the Spirit Box sweeping,

14:01.917 --> 14:04.585
and then you hear this voice
say this full sentence.

14:04.587 --> 14:07.054
ZAK: I break away from
preparing for lockdown

14:07.056 --> 14:09.189
to join the audio review.

14:09.191 --> 14:11.959
<i>-[ Indistinct voice ]</i>
<i>-Whoa!</i>

14:11.961 --> 14:13.060
-Can you hear it?
-Yeah.

14:13.062 --> 14:14.995
-You can, huh?
-What do you hear, Rich?

14:14.997 --> 14:16.663
"Going to" or "going"...

14:16.665 --> 14:18.899
Okay.
Now, she's saying where to go.

14:18.901 --> 14:20.734
I want you to try
and listen to the word.

14:20.736 --> 14:22.235
We're not going to tell you
what she says.

14:22.237 --> 14:23.403
Okay.

14:23.405 --> 14:25.672
<i>...basement.</i>

14:25.674 --> 14:27.074
-Basement.
-Yes!

14:27.076 --> 14:29.776
-Yes! [ Laughs ]
-Thank you.

14:29.778 --> 14:31.511
<i>-...go in the basement.</i>
<i>-Whoa!</i>

14:31.513 --> 14:34.181
<i>-...go in the basement.</i>
<i>-Whoa!</i>

14:34.183 --> 14:35.349
It's smart.

14:35.351 --> 14:36.683
Not only that,
you said, "Where do we go?"

14:36.685 --> 14:38.218
You asked that question.

14:38.220 --> 14:40.187
<i>AARON: Do you know where they</i>
<i>were killed in the house?</i>

14:40.189 --> 14:41.688
And then she says...

14:41.690 --> 14:43.023
<i>...go in the basement.</i>

14:43.025 --> 14:45.258
Oh, my God. I didn't know you
said that before that.

14:45.260 --> 14:47.928
Yeah.
I was trying to find out.

14:47.930 --> 14:50.464
These spirits are not at rest.

14:50.466 --> 14:53.667
They are here, and they want us
to know what happened

14:53.669 --> 14:55.102
so they have closure.

14:55.104 --> 14:56.970
This could be one
of the victims,

14:56.972 --> 14:59.740
the mother or the daughter,
telling us that their bodies

14:59.742 --> 15:01.375
could be in the basement.

15:01.377 --> 15:03.910
Hector confirmed that,
at its original location

15:03.912 --> 15:05.779
only a few miles
from the museum,

15:05.781 --> 15:08.815
the Murder House did
indeed have a basement.

15:08.817 --> 15:10.417
So at the other place,
there was a basement?

15:10.419 --> 15:11.618
There was a basement.

15:11.620 --> 15:12.886
-And...
-Oh, gosh.

15:12.888 --> 15:14.254
AARON: Yeah, right?

15:14.256 --> 15:15.956
No, I got chills.
I'm sorry.

15:15.958 --> 15:19.192
¶¶

15:19.194 --> 15:21.294
I got to go meet
Jay real quick, okay?

15:21.296 --> 15:22.929
I got to go meet Jay.
He's doing research.

15:22.931 --> 15:25.666
Jay has been looking
for documentation

15:25.668 --> 15:27.901
of a murder-suicide
matching the one

15:27.903 --> 15:31.171
we've been hearing about
in the Murder House.

15:31.173 --> 15:34.908
I found two different articles,
one from 1941,

15:34.910 --> 15:38.178
where a man killed a 6-year-old
and then committed suicide.

15:38.180 --> 15:39.479
A son, not a daughter?

15:39.481 --> 15:41.782
-Right.
-Okay.

15:41.784 --> 15:43.417
This one is a little
more promising.

15:43.419 --> 15:45.218
This one was in 1956.

15:45.220 --> 15:49.256
A man went into his girlfriend's
house, killed her two children,

15:49.258 --> 15:52.526
her, and then committed
suicide in the house.

15:52.528 --> 15:53.860
-This sounds...
-Holy cow.

15:53.862 --> 15:55.462
...a lot closer to the stories
that we've been hearing.

15:55.464 --> 16:00.333
"Montrose man slays mother of
two, then takes his own life."

16:00.335 --> 16:02.969
ZAK: Aaron joins us to
compare Jay's research

16:02.971 --> 16:05.205
with what he experienced
in the house.

16:05.207 --> 16:07.374
A voice from
the Murder House said,

16:07.376 --> 16:09.042
"Listen.
Go to the basement."

16:09.044 --> 16:10.944
-Right.
-That's what it said, right?

16:10.946 --> 16:13.146
What if that was the mother's
last words to the kids?

16:13.148 --> 16:14.347
That's what I thought.

16:14.349 --> 16:15.716
-Oh, wow.
-That's what I thought.

16:15.718 --> 16:17.584
You know, they're being
attacked, and she's like,

16:17.586 --> 16:19.653
"Go to the basement,"
like, to run away.

16:19.655 --> 16:21.588
-Holy cow, Jay.
-Yeah.

16:21.590 --> 16:23.924
That could have been literally
her last words to her children.

16:23.926 --> 16:26.460
ZAK: Telling her daughter,
the children...

16:28.564 --> 16:29.963
-Aaron.
-Yeah?

16:29.965 --> 16:32.532
What I want you to do right now
before we start lockdown,

16:32.534 --> 16:34.468
I want you to walk
around this museum.

16:34.470 --> 16:35.702
It's massive.

16:35.704 --> 16:37.204
Look through
all these artifacts.

16:37.206 --> 16:39.740
See if you can find
any object at all

16:39.742 --> 16:41.808
that may have a curse
attached to it

16:41.810 --> 16:43.243
because Bob said something.

16:43.245 --> 16:46.413
He said that, in here,
there is a dark presence.

16:46.415 --> 16:52.285
Is there a bad entity here
that is affecting

16:52.287 --> 16:54.321
the living in
a negative way?

16:54.323 --> 16:57.290
I'd have to say yes.

16:57.292 --> 16:59.860
Wait.

16:59.862 --> 17:01.561
That's real.

17:03.932 --> 17:06.666
I wonder -- Hang on,
isn't there another one?

17:06.668 --> 17:09.803
Yeah, the dentist office.

17:09.805 --> 17:11.972
Right here.
Right here.

17:11.974 --> 17:14.074
That's real, too.

17:14.076 --> 17:17.477
¶¶

17:17.479 --> 17:20.013
Look, look.

17:22.117 --> 17:24.117
ZAK:
This skull has a gold tooth.

17:24.119 --> 17:28.522
Could the spirit of its owner
be trying to reclaim it?

17:28.524 --> 17:31.491
My first time that I ever
owned a human skull,

17:31.493 --> 17:32.959
I brought it into my home...

17:32.961 --> 17:35.228
That's right.
I remember this.

17:35.230 --> 17:37.063
...and then I was
dragged out of my bed.

17:37.065 --> 17:40.700
You don't know who these are.
You look at the skulls.

17:40.702 --> 17:42.702
Well, there all human skulls,
but those human skulls

17:42.704 --> 17:45.172
are each individual people.

17:45.174 --> 17:47.407
This could be a serial killer.

17:47.409 --> 17:49.409
Does he know the stories
on these skulls,

17:49.411 --> 17:51.111
or did he just get
him and find them?

17:51.113 --> 17:52.646
Let's go find him.

17:54.616 --> 17:56.516
Are there any
human skulls

17:56.518 --> 17:58.652
that you own that
are in this museum

17:58.654 --> 18:01.655
that have any kind
of horrendous story

18:01.657 --> 18:04.291
attached to them, a murder?

18:04.293 --> 18:05.992
That one, I can tell you
the story about it.

18:05.994 --> 18:07.494
Do we want to go
over there and --

18:07.496 --> 18:10.063
Wait,
there's another one?

18:10.065 --> 18:12.432
Rich, a retired archaeologist,

18:12.434 --> 18:15.068
discovered this skull
deep in the ground

18:15.070 --> 18:19.105
wrapped in a Confederate
Army uniform in 1967.

18:19.107 --> 18:21.341
FIKE:
We've had studies made on it.

18:21.343 --> 18:24.444
It's a woman about 17 years old.

18:24.446 --> 18:27.047
Why was she wrapped
in a cavalry jacket

18:27.049 --> 18:30.050
and buried and no other
parts of the body?

18:30.052 --> 18:33.820
Her head was decapitated,
or else there'd be a whole body.

18:33.822 --> 18:36.389
She would have been
given a burial

18:36.391 --> 18:39.926
unless somebody came and
ambushed them and robbed them

18:39.928 --> 18:42.829
and wrapped her head up
in his jacket, then buried her.

18:42.831 --> 18:44.264
Maybe.

18:44.266 --> 18:47.434
-The word "ghost" just came up.
-Oh, my God.

18:47.436 --> 18:49.269
Something just
touched my wrist.

18:49.271 --> 18:50.570
What?!

18:54.216 --> 18:58.919
¶¶

18:58.921 --> 19:00.621
Okay.
This is it.

19:00.623 --> 19:03.557
We are in Montrose, Colorado.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.592
We are out in the middle
of nowhere in a place

19:05.594 --> 19:08.796
where a man brought all
these historic buildings,

19:08.798 --> 19:11.432
some of them with very dark
history attached to them,

19:11.434 --> 19:15.169
and transplanted them right here
next to some cornfields.

19:15.171 --> 19:18.071
It's an amazing place,
Museum of the Mountain West,

19:18.073 --> 19:19.606
but they have problems.

19:19.608 --> 19:22.609
The problems
are aggressive, angry,

19:22.611 --> 19:27.881
even possibly evil spirits
that are affecting people

19:27.883 --> 19:30.317
and, more seriously,
what we investigated earlier,

19:30.319 --> 19:33.353
possibly giving them
serious health problems.

19:33.355 --> 19:36.924
¶¶

19:36.926 --> 19:39.159
Billy, Aaron, myself,

19:39.161 --> 19:41.028
we're going to start off
in the museum

19:41.030 --> 19:43.330
over at the saloon
and the other areas,

19:43.332 --> 19:45.165
trying to track down
the bad entity

19:45.167 --> 19:48.235
that's been really having
a bad effect on guests.

19:48.237 --> 19:50.838
Jay, I'm going to lock you

19:50.840 --> 19:54.341
inside of this old
carriage works house,

19:54.343 --> 19:55.943
and I'm going
to tell you why.

19:55.945 --> 19:59.179
As we arrived here,
we were told that a gentleman

19:59.181 --> 20:02.583
who was here during
the day had a saw blade,

20:02.585 --> 20:06.820
a circular saw blade,
get thrown at him upstairs.

20:06.822 --> 20:09.423
An actual blade.

20:09.425 --> 20:12.326
To us, that's amazing,
and it could be dangerous,

20:12.328 --> 20:15.429
and because we received
a Class A EVP

20:15.431 --> 20:17.564
that said, "Behind you,"
in here,

20:17.566 --> 20:20.367
irrefutable proof
that this spirit is here.

20:20.369 --> 20:22.669
We had a professor, Dr. Todd,

20:22.671 --> 20:25.672
witness this from Western State
Colorado University.

20:25.674 --> 20:28.108
<i>-I heard three barks.</i>
<i>-Behind you.</i>

20:28.110 --> 20:29.543
"Behind you."

20:29.545 --> 20:31.512
Before Aaron, Billy, and myself

20:31.514 --> 20:33.680
begin our investigation
at the museum,

20:33.682 --> 20:37.451
we leave Jay all by himself
inside the carriage house

20:37.453 --> 20:39.820
and padlock
the doors behind him.

20:39.822 --> 20:49.830

20:49.832 --> 20:55.269

20:55.271 --> 20:57.571
JAY: I keep thinking
I hear walking.

21:00.376 --> 21:09.550
¶¶

21:09.552 --> 21:12.019
We're aiming the talking
EVP device,

21:12.021 --> 21:14.655
which gathers a lot of
different environmental data.

21:14.657 --> 21:15.923
BILLY: Right.

21:15.925 --> 21:18.959
It gathers dew points, the IR
temperature, luminance,

21:18.961 --> 21:21.662
distance, humidity,
barometric pressure.

21:21.664 --> 21:24.064
So we're aiming this
at the clock,

21:24.066 --> 21:27.601
the clock that mysteriously
stopped at the same exact time

21:27.603 --> 21:30.470
that Wanda,
who died right here,

21:30.472 --> 21:33.407
was interred into the ground
during her funeral

21:33.409 --> 21:35.475
exactly 3 days later.

21:35.477 --> 21:40.213
It's right here, too, that
myself and Rich had amazing,

21:40.215 --> 21:42.082
unexplained experiences.

21:42.084 --> 21:43.450
Oh, my gosh.

21:43.452 --> 21:45.953
I just felt an ice-cold air
on my left arm right here.

21:45.955 --> 21:47.387
Something's happening.

21:47.389 --> 21:49.423
I just -- I can't --
I can't breathe too well.

21:49.425 --> 21:51.525
Wanda, are you here?

21:51.527 --> 21:55.462
¶¶

21:55.464 --> 21:58.231
So, right now, I'm standing
in the same exact spot

21:58.233 --> 22:00.300
where Wanda died.

22:02.538 --> 22:06.206
Wanda, are you able to give us
some more evidence

22:06.208 --> 22:08.375
that you're here with us?

22:08.377 --> 22:13.647
We really want to know
about life after death.

22:15.517 --> 22:18.652
It says "ghost."

22:18.654 --> 22:20.053
-What?
-It just said "ghost."

22:20.055 --> 22:21.588
-For real?
-Are you kidding me?

22:21.590 --> 22:24.725
Ghost.
The word "ghost" just came up.

22:24.727 --> 22:26.526
Yes.
Thank you.

22:26.528 --> 22:30.030
That's what we want
to know about, ghosts.

22:30.032 --> 22:33.533
Did you just figure out
how to use this device,

22:33.535 --> 22:36.536
or is there any
other spirit in here,

22:36.538 --> 22:40.040
and if there is, can you
tell us why you're here?

22:40.042 --> 22:41.642
-What was that?
-What was?

22:41.644 --> 22:44.311
Something just touched my wrist,
grabbed onto it.

22:44.313 --> 22:46.213
-For real?
-For real, grabbed it.

22:46.215 --> 22:47.514
-Billy...
-I'm not kidding you.

22:47.516 --> 22:49.950
I felt fingers on my wrist
right here.

22:49.952 --> 22:53.320
Hold on.
I'm going to look this up, dude.

22:53.322 --> 22:56.690
I just saw a black mass,
and I just asked

22:56.692 --> 22:58.959
if there's a spirit here,
who are you?

22:58.961 --> 23:01.561
And if you just touched Billy,
who are you,

23:01.563 --> 23:04.064
and why are you here?

23:04.066 --> 23:06.633
How did you die?

23:06.635 --> 23:08.669
It says "guy shot."

23:08.671 --> 23:09.903
-Shut up.
-What?

23:09.905 --> 23:11.905
Wait, "guy...shot...George."

23:11.907 --> 23:14.241
-There's even a name.
-Oh, my god.

23:14.243 --> 23:15.375
-No.
-Yes.

23:15.377 --> 23:18.979
I just said, "If there
is a spirit here,

23:18.981 --> 23:20.614
tell me who you are,

23:20.616 --> 23:22.649
and how did you get here
or how did you die?"

23:22.651 --> 23:24.051
Right.
How did you die?

23:24.053 --> 23:27.721
Right? And it just said,
"Guy, shot, cough,"

23:27.723 --> 23:30.290
[coughs] and then gave us
his name, George.

23:30.292 --> 23:32.459
Yeah. When you asked that --
Zak, can you see my hand?

23:32.461 --> 23:33.627
Yeah.

23:33.629 --> 23:35.295
This is what it felt
like, Aaron,

23:35.297 --> 23:36.863
like someone grabbed my wrist.
That's why I --

23:36.865 --> 23:38.265
Yeah, you freaked.

23:38.267 --> 23:39.700
Hello, George.

23:39.702 --> 23:42.836
Thank you for coming to us
and communicating with us.

23:45.040 --> 23:48.341
George, I'd like to do something

23:48.343 --> 23:51.144
to really prove
that you're here.

23:51.146 --> 23:53.480
I want to turn on
another device.

23:53.482 --> 23:56.583
We immediately begin trying
to communicate with George,

23:56.585 --> 23:58.719
as well as Wanda's spirit,

23:58.721 --> 24:01.421
by using our SB7

-It says what?

24:12.101 --> 24:14.301
-It just said a name.
-What name?

24:14.303 --> 24:15.836
Kate.

ZAK: Right after I ask,
"Who's in here with us?"

24:18.040 --> 24:23.643
our talking EVP device instantly
responds with the name of Kate.

that we've heard?

to finish his sentence

the spirit of George.

are captured

something incredible.

Watch the window very closely
as a black mass appears

to move past it
from right to left.

29:18.457 --> 29:21.591
We believe this to be
a well-defined shadow figure

walking around up here.

29:25.030 --> 29:27.397

on the outside

because this is the second
floor of the building,

if this is the same entity

it was as if something
was out here watching us.

to this direction.
