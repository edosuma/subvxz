10:44.818 --> 10:46.254
she might get five years.

10:46.297 --> 10:48.343
That's a very long time
for someone her age.

10:48.386 --> 10:50.171
That's why I'm hoping
she'll reconsider.

10:50.214 --> 10:51.651
Yeah,

10:51.694 --> 10:53.348
that's not gonna happen.

10:54.349 --> 10:56.177
Well...

10:56.220 --> 10:58.788
Let's hope she comes around.
I got to go.

10:58.832 --> 11:01.051
Keep me in
the loop.
Yeah.

11:01.095 --> 11:02.792
Good luck.

11:02.836 --> 11:04.402
Izzy, how are you?

11:04.446 --> 11:05.665
I'm Thomas,

11:05.708 --> 11:06.970
this is Juliet.
Hi.

11:07.014 --> 11:08.015
Thank you for doing this.

11:08.058 --> 11:09.320
Of course.

11:09.364 --> 11:11.409
Katsumoto filled us in
on a few details.

11:11.453 --> 11:12.672
He said that you were
supposed to pick up

11:12.715 --> 11:14.325
your daughter Kai
at the airport.

11:14.369 --> 11:15.979
Yeah, she was on a return flight

11:16.023 --> 11:17.067
from Japan
this morning.

11:17.111 --> 11:18.329
We made plans

11:18.373 --> 11:19.591
to-to meet at the curb,

11:19.635 --> 11:22.507
I called her ten times,
waited an hour.

11:22.551 --> 11:24.814
Nothing.What was she doing in Japan?

11:24.858 --> 11:27.599
MMA. Had a couple fights
over there.

11:27.643 --> 11:28.818
My daughter's gonna

11:28.862 --> 11:30.385
go pro soon.

11:30.428 --> 11:32.692
Okay, well, we'll
definitely look into it.

11:34.650 --> 11:37.392
I-I don't know
how much you charge for this...

11:37.435 --> 11:38.698
Yeah, I wouldn't even
worry about it.

11:38.741 --> 11:40.177
If we don't find
your daughter

11:40.221 --> 11:41.831
in the first 24 hours,
HPD's gonna take over anyway.

11:41.875 --> 11:42.832
Either way,
you'll have

11:42.876 --> 11:43.877
some answers soon.

11:43.920 --> 11:44.834
Okay.

11:49.883 --> 11:51.536
MAGNUM [chuckles]:
Alema.

11:51.580 --> 11:53.451
Magnum. Howzit, brah?

11:53.495 --> 11:55.758
This is my partner
Juliet Higgins.
Hi.

11:55.802 --> 11:56.846
Nice to meet you.

11:56.890 --> 11:59.544
So, I need a favor.

11:59.588 --> 12:01.546
Didn't I just hook you up?

12:01.590 --> 12:03.070
Alema's little brother

12:03.113 --> 12:04.593
plays QB for the
Rainbow Warriors.

12:04.636 --> 12:07.727
And Alema was nice enough
to hook me up with some seats.

12:07.770 --> 12:09.250
And field passes.Yes.

12:09.293 --> 12:11.382
And I lent you my car
for that date. Remember that?

12:11.426 --> 12:12.688
So we're even on that one.Right.

12:12.732 --> 12:13.907
This is an entirely
different favor.

12:13.950 --> 12:16.387
Yourcar?

12:16.431 --> 12:17.214
Hold on.

12:17.258 --> 12:18.912
So, I just need

12:18.955 --> 12:20.740
to see some security footage
from this morning,

12:20.783 --> 12:21.958
uh, Terminal 2.

12:22.002 --> 12:24.439
Yeah? And what do I get?

12:30.010 --> 12:32.229
Don't you think you should have,
uh, cleared it with Rick

12:32.273 --> 12:34.449
before you offered Alema here
a free meal?

12:34.492 --> 12:37.669
You know, I find it easier
to beg for forgiveness

12:37.713 --> 12:39.280
than ask for
permission.Mm-hmm.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.458
Oh, hold on. There she is.

12:43.501 --> 12:44.807
Right there.
See if you can zoom in.

12:50.117 --> 12:51.596
Well, those two don't
exactly look friendly.

12:58.386 --> 12:59.953
Recognize someone?

12:59.996 --> 13:01.476
They're soldiers
for Hiroki Matsui,

13:01.519 --> 13:04.784
head of the Yoshida clan,
it's a yakuza offshoot.

13:04.827 --> 13:07.090
Been making inroads
in Hawaii recently.

13:07.134 --> 13:09.789
Narcotics. Gambling.

13:09.832 --> 13:12.617
Vice has been trying
to shut them down.

13:12.661 --> 13:13.836
But this doesn't seem
like an abduction.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.446
It looks like Kai
goes willingly.

13:15.490 --> 13:17.318
MAGNUM:
Yeah, but it's a public
place. They may be

13:17.361 --> 13:18.928
making an effort
not to make a scene.

13:18.972 --> 13:21.148
Or they could be
threatening her.

13:21.191 --> 13:22.279
KATSUMOTO:
Except we don't
know that for sure.

13:22.323 --> 13:23.628
HIGGINS:
Look. Look at her reaction.

13:23.672 --> 13:25.935
Her lips are pursed.
That's a sign of fear.

13:25.979 --> 13:27.458
I mean, that's not
something you expect

13:27.502 --> 13:29.286
from one who engages in
blood sport for a living.

13:29.330 --> 13:30.810
KATSUMOTO:
You have a point.

13:30.853 --> 13:32.159
But that's still not enough.

13:32.202 --> 13:33.334
There's no obvious crime here.

13:33.377 --> 13:34.988
And I can't put a tail
on someone

13:35.031 --> 13:36.859
without probable cause.MAGNUM: Well,
it's a good thing

13:36.903 --> 13:38.687
we're not bound
by the same rules you are.

13:38.730 --> 13:40.689
HIGGINS:
We'll let you know
what we find.

13:40.732 --> 13:41.864
Guys.

13:42.952 --> 13:44.388
If Kai is mixed up with Matsui,

13:44.432 --> 13:45.868
it's not gonna end well for her.

13:45.912 --> 13:48.479
Odds are she'll wind up
in prison or dead,

13:48.523 --> 13:50.394
so whatever you're gonna do,
do it fast.

13:58.054 --> 13:59.577
HIGGINS:
According to Kamekona,

13:59.621 --> 14:02.842
Matsui works out of a club
called Desire, on Cooke Street.

14:02.885 --> 14:04.756
Okay, we'll start from there.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.671
[phone ringing]Oh.

14:06.715 --> 14:09.326
Is it Katsumoto?No, it's Ethan.

14:09.370 --> 14:12.199
Hello there.

14:12.242 --> 14:13.722
[chuckles]

14:15.811 --> 14:17.030
Yeah, no, that sounds lovely.

14:18.596 --> 14:19.728

14:19.771 --> 14:21.730
How did the big surgery go?

14:26.430 --> 14:27.518
[phone ringing]

14:27.562 --> 14:28.737
I know.

14:28.780 --> 14:30.130
Me, too.Hey, our client's calling.

14:30.173 --> 14:31.435
Could you maybe
put your love life

14:31.479 --> 14:32.697
on hold for a second?

14:32.741 --> 14:34.961
Sorry, Ethan, Magnum needs me.

14:35.004 --> 14:37.789
I know, he can't seem
to do anything without me.

14:40.053 --> 14:42.403
Yeah, I'll call you later.
Okay, bye.

14:42.446 --> 14:44.187
Sorry.[phone beeps]

14:44.231 --> 14:45.972
Izzy.IZZY: Good news.

14:46.015 --> 14:48.148
She's okay.Wait, what?

14:48.191 --> 14:49.889
Yeah, I just talked to Kai.

14:49.932 --> 14:52.239
Uh, she lost her phone,
went to the wrong terminal.

14:52.282 --> 14:54.197
But it's all good.

14:54.241 --> 14:56.199
False alarm.

14:56.243 --> 14:59.159
Okay, uh...Well, we're glad
that she's, uh,

14:59.202 --> 15:00.943
turned up safe.

15:00.987 --> 15:02.118
Thank you so much.

15:02.162 --> 15:03.554
I really appreciate your help.

15:03.598 --> 15:05.121
MAGNUM: Yeah, no problem.HIGGINS: Bye.

15:06.166 --> 15:07.297
Uh, that's weird.

15:07.341 --> 15:09.386
Why would Kai lie to her father?

15:09.430 --> 15:11.127
Maybe she doesn't
want him to know

15:11.171 --> 15:13.042
that she's consorting
with criminals.

15:13.086 --> 15:16.393
I don't know, my gut tells me
there's something more to it.

15:16.437 --> 15:18.439
Well, regardless, I mean,
she's surfaced,

15:18.482 --> 15:19.657
so the case is over.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.927
Her deception's
really bothering you.

15:27.970 --> 15:30.190
It's just strange.

15:30.233 --> 15:31.408
Okay.

15:32.757 --> 15:35.282
I'll track her phone,
I'll text Gordon an update.

15:43.464 --> 15:46.075
If you're here to convince
me to give the skull back,

15:46.119 --> 15:47.250
don't bother.

15:47.294 --> 15:48.948
I won't do it.

15:50.819 --> 15:53.735
You think I don't know that?

15:53.778 --> 15:55.955
Now, Thomas and Higgy
told me everything.

15:55.998 --> 15:58.522
I just came by
to let you know I got you.

15:58.566 --> 16:00.960
I appreciate it, TC.

16:01.003 --> 16:02.004
[laughs softly]

16:05.834 --> 16:08.837
Do I see cookies?

16:08.880 --> 16:11.274
Just made a batch.
You want one?

16:11.318 --> 16:12.797
Come on, you already
know. I don't turn down

16:12.841 --> 16:15.104
that homemade gold.

16:15.148 --> 16:18.064
Macadamia nut chocolate chip.

16:18.107 --> 16:20.196
Well, in that case,
I will take two.

16:20.240 --> 16:21.502
Milk?

16:21.545 --> 16:23.025
If you want to see me grinning

16:23.069 --> 16:24.635
like a five-year-old, yes.

16:24.679 --> 16:26.376
[laughs]

16:28.117 --> 16:30.119
You know, for the record,

16:30.163 --> 16:32.034
I think you're doing
the right thing.

16:32.078 --> 16:33.644
Thank you.

16:33.688 --> 16:35.342
That means a lot.

16:35.385 --> 16:36.996
I just want to make sure
you buried that skull

16:37.039 --> 16:38.301
in a safe place.

16:38.345 --> 16:41.478
Someplace HPD
can't find it.

16:41.522 --> 16:43.654
Look, if you're willing
to go to jail over this thing,

16:43.698 --> 16:45.134
I don't want it to be in vain.

16:45.178 --> 16:47.006
No, you don't have to worry
about that.

16:47.049 --> 16:49.008
The skull is in a safe place.

16:50.052 --> 16:51.140
Good.

16:51.184 --> 16:52.750
I got it stashed

16:52.794 --> 16:53.838
in the laundry room
in the guesthouse.

16:55.362 --> 16:57.016
[laughs]
Wait, what?

16:57.059 --> 16:59.322
Thomas never
goes in there anyway.

16:59.366 --> 17:01.324
Yeah, but I just assumed

17:01.368 --> 17:02.847
that you had already put it
in the ground.

17:02.891 --> 17:04.327
Why would you
bring it back here?

17:04.371 --> 17:06.547
It's temporary.

17:06.590 --> 17:09.419
Noelani was kind enough
to take a sample from the skull

17:09.463 --> 17:10.594
to carbon-date it.

17:10.638 --> 17:14.076
Hopefully the results
confirm my hunch.

17:14.120 --> 17:15.382
Assuming it does,

17:15.425 --> 17:17.340
I plan to return the skull
to the same place

17:17.384 --> 17:18.559
Makani's mother

17:18.602 --> 17:22.171
put him
two centuries ago.

17:22.215 --> 17:24.173
And you're thinking
this could happen before

17:24.217 --> 17:25.522
they take you
into custody?

17:25.566 --> 17:28.830
Hopefully it does. If not...

17:30.658 --> 17:32.442
I hate to ask anyone
to do this, but...

17:32.486 --> 17:33.791
Please.

17:33.835 --> 17:36.794
You don't have to.

17:36.838 --> 17:38.100
We'll make sure it gets done.

17:38.144 --> 17:41.060
You sure?
You'd be committing a crime.

Now, who had my back

when we were out there

a sex life, Magnum.

on the stakeout last week.

22:33.395 --> 22:34.701
And I-I'm assuming

22:34.744 --> 22:36.398
that had something to do
with this guy, right?

22:36.442 --> 22:39.009
Okay, number one, that stakeout
was not a two-man job,

23:41.463 --> 23:42.769
Hmm.

23:42.812 --> 23:44.553
Hmm.And I checked.

23:44.597 --> 23:47.077

called the PFA.

this morning

at the airport?

23:58.001 --> 24:00.134

Well, he did.

24:00.177 --> 24:01.570
He was worried about you.

24:02.919 --> 24:04.791
Well, obviously I'm fine.
So why are you following me?

24:04.834 --> 24:06.270
Because while we
were looking for you,

24:06.314 --> 24:08.664
we became aware of your
connection to the Yoshida clan.

24:08.708 --> 24:11.754
We became concerned and
we decided to stay on the case

24:11.798 --> 24:13.452
even after you surfaced.

24:16.063 --> 24:17.630
Uh, they want you
to throw a fight,

but you are.

you just met us, but...

We can help.

All right, there's this
underground match tonight.

on the line.

24:37.519 --> 24:40.783
They want me to tap
out in the third.

24:40.827 --> 24:42.481
Okay.

24:42.524 --> 24:43.960
Why are you agreeing to it?

24:44.004 --> 24:46.006
Because in
this sport,

24:46.049 --> 24:47.486
organized crime
controls everything.

24:47.529 --> 24:49.139
This is my only way
to get a shot.

No, that's-that's
not true.

want that.I don't have a choice.

24:56.930 --> 24:58.714
Of course you do.You don't
know anything.

24:58.758 --> 25:00.803
My dad's been out of work
for months.

25:00.847 --> 25:02.718
And on top of that, his
health ain't so good.

25:04.851 --> 25:07.810
He's always taken
care of me.

25:07.854 --> 25:09.377
Now it's my turn.

25:10.378 --> 25:11.814
We understand that.

25:11.858 --> 25:13.337
This is not the way to do it.

25:13.381 --> 25:14.817
This is none of your business.

25:14.861 --> 25:16.645
Well, we're making
it our business.

25:16.689 --> 25:19.213
We've dealt with people
like this before.

25:19.256 --> 25:23.173
If you get in too deep,
there is no way out, ever.

25:23.217 --> 25:26.046
You have to walk away
from this, now.

I shouldn't fight.

you'd want to know.

Even if I wanted
to back out, I can't.

These aren't the kind of people

impossible situation.

Which is only gonna get worse if
we don't do something about it.

26:21.623 --> 26:23.582
No, I-I get it, Kamekona,
but we need somebody

26:23.625 --> 26:25.061

sit down with,

26:29.457 --> 26:31.111
Look, the only way
it's gonna work out

26:31.154 --> 26:35.681
is if we can get somebody
who can lean on Matsui.

26:35.724 --> 26:36.899
Okay.

26:37.944 --> 26:40.424
Hit me back.

26:40.468 --> 26:41.817

Well, he's gonna try,
but there's no guarantee.

KUMU:
Hi.

26:46.779 --> 26:49.825
So, what's the latest?

26:49.869 --> 26:51.522
Well, a friend of mine at UH
gave me access

26:51.566 --> 26:53.524
to their accelerated
mass spectrometer,

26:53.568 --> 26:56.092
so I could analyze the sample
on my own without having

26:56.136 --> 26:57.920
to go through
the usual channels.

26:57.964 --> 27:01.794
What exactly is an
accelerated mass spectrometer?

27:01.837 --> 27:03.012
It can tell us
how old the skull is

27:03.056 --> 27:04.753
and the approximate
age of the person.

27:04.797 --> 27:06.450
And the data
indicates

27:06.494 --> 27:08.365
it belongs to a
12-year-old boy

27:08.409 --> 27:10.672
who lived in the
late 18th century.

27:10.716 --> 27:12.456

So I'm right?

27:12.500 --> 27:15.111
Well, I can't be 100% certain
that it is Makani,

27:15.155 --> 27:18.288
but the skull did have a pretty
severe basilar fracture,

27:18.332 --> 27:20.464

fall from a great height.

with it...

they're gonna let him go.
