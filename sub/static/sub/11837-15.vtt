WEBVTT

00:01.467 --> 00:03.203
SHORE:
Previously on "The Practice"...

00:03.235 --> 00:05.005
PAUL: Brenda Wilbur,
who I believed you know,

00:05.038 --> 00:06.239
she's dead.
What?

00:06.272 --> 00:07.974
The police are out there.
I was there.

00:08.007 --> 00:09.342
I had made love to her earlier

00:09.375 --> 00:11.144
and now they're here
to ask me questions.

00:11.177 --> 00:12.345
I need money, Alan.

00:12.378 --> 00:14.681
So much so I sometimes see it
in my dreams.

00:14.715 --> 00:17.083
I especially saw it
at 10:30 last night

00:17.117 --> 00:18.418
when I saw Paul Stewart

00:18.451 --> 00:20.153
coming out of Brenda's house.

00:20.186 --> 00:21.688
How are we arranging
to pay her off?

00:21.722 --> 00:25.491
I cannot bribe this witness.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.761
I'm not letting
my only child go to prison.

00:27.794 --> 00:30.564
SHORE: Wives don't statistically
leave their husbands

00:30.597 --> 00:31.898
over infidelity.

00:31.932 --> 00:33.767
You cannot walk out
that door now.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.902
Maybe I do think
he's guilty of murder.

00:35.936 --> 00:37.303
Did he do this?

00:38.572 --> 00:40.006
People change.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.643
If you only knew
what I've become.

00:42.676 --> 00:44.010
When you were 16,

00:44.044 --> 00:46.246
you slept with your
best friend's mother.

00:46.279 --> 00:48.481
How have you changed, Alan?

00:48.515 --> 00:49.583
PAUL: I miss her.

00:49.616 --> 00:51.184
Somebody you love has died.

00:51.217 --> 00:53.720
You're allowed to grieve.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.522
VICTORIA: I'd like you
to stay away from him.

00:55.556 --> 00:56.523
WILSON: I'm sorry?

00:56.557 --> 00:58.625
I fear
he's becoming attached.

00:58.659 --> 01:01.968
I think a little distance
is in order for you,

01:02.002 --> 01:03.103
Ms. Wilson.

01:03.136 --> 01:05.405
This girl ended up
in some very unlikely places.

01:05.438 --> 01:06.773
You, of all people know that.

01:06.807 --> 01:07.541
Meaning?

01:07.574 --> 01:08.742
Was she ever with you?

01:08.775 --> 01:09.909
Are you out of your mind?

01:09.943 --> 01:11.745
Whatever you share
with me here,

01:11.778 --> 01:14.147
it stays confidential
between two old friends.

01:14.180 --> 01:15.381
TOM: Two old friends
having a beer.

01:15.415 --> 01:16.382
You have my word.

01:16.416 --> 01:18.084
It happened once.

01:18.118 --> 01:20.954
I've been subpoenaed
by the prosecution.

01:20.987 --> 01:22.322
Why?
He came here

01:22.355 --> 01:23.323
the night of the murder.

01:23.356 --> 01:24.490
Paul?

01:24.525 --> 01:25.692
TOM: He said that
he needed to confess.

01:25.726 --> 01:27.493
PAUL: I needed to speak
with my priest.

01:27.528 --> 01:29.162
I didn't go to confess murder.

01:29.195 --> 01:30.564
Well, this doesn't look good,
Paul.

01:30.597 --> 01:32.332
You're seen leaving
the victim's house,

01:32.365 --> 01:33.499
then seen minutes later

01:33.534 --> 01:35.836
rushing to a priest
ostensibly to confess.

01:35.869 --> 01:37.037
PAUL: They have no witnesses

01:37.070 --> 01:38.739
to my leaving the house.
SHORE: You hope.

01:38.772 --> 01:41.341
CATHERINE: I saw Paul Stewart
leave Brenda Wilbur's house

01:41.374 --> 01:43.610
around 10:30 the night
of the murder.

01:43.644 --> 01:46.780
Paul's mother paid me $600,000

01:46.813 --> 01:47.948
not to come forward.

01:47.981 --> 01:51.785
But I have no doubt
he killed that woman.

01:53.787 --> 01:54.788
KEVIN: Personally, I think

01:54.821 --> 01:56.957
it's a mistake
to hire Alan Shore.

01:56.990 --> 01:59.926
People in Dedham remember him
and, well...

01:59.960 --> 02:01.201
I won't call him a liar,

02:01.234 --> 02:02.302
but let me put it this way,

02:02.335 --> 02:03.704
if he went out to feed the pigs,

02:03.737 --> 02:05.271
you'd have to get somebody else
to call them.

02:05.305 --> 02:06.540
(laughter)

02:06.573 --> 02:07.608
SHORE: (laughing)

02:07.641 --> 02:09.074
That was very funny, Kevin.

02:09.109 --> 02:11.377
I demand you stop referring
to this man as witless.

02:12.813 --> 02:13.714
Come on, Alan.

02:17.483 --> 02:20.153
CLARKE: We will present evidence
of the affair.

02:20.186 --> 02:21.321
You will hear from a witness

02:21.354 --> 02:23.156
who places the defendant
at the scene.

02:23.189 --> 02:25.726
You will hear
from scientific experts

02:25.759 --> 02:29.129
who establish hair,
body oils, semen,

02:29.162 --> 02:30.396
on or in the victim,

02:30.430 --> 02:32.533
all coming from the defendant.

02:32.566 --> 02:35.268
Clothing taken
from the defendant's home

02:35.301 --> 02:36.837
with blood spatterings
from the victim.

02:36.870 --> 02:40.240
Ladies and gentlemen,
in short, the evidence,

02:40.273 --> 02:41.474
all of it,

02:41.508 --> 02:44.177
eyewitnesses, forensics, motive,

02:44.210 --> 02:46.613
every bit of it
points to one suspect

02:46.647 --> 02:49.249
and only one suspect.

02:49.282 --> 02:50.651
Paul Stewart.

02:59.159 --> 03:01.502
Isn't it exciting?

03:01.535 --> 03:02.836
A murder...

03:02.869 --> 03:04.838
right in our own town.

03:04.871 --> 03:06.573
The delicious kind, too.

03:06.607 --> 03:09.109
One of our own dead,
one of our own charged,

03:09.142 --> 03:10.777
one of our own prosecuting,

03:10.811 --> 03:11.745
and best of all,

03:11.778 --> 03:14.615
one of our own defending, me.

03:14.648 --> 03:16.282
My name is Alan Shore

03:16.316 --> 03:19.786
and I assure you
I'll be doing everything I can

03:19.820 --> 03:22.523
to make this proceeding
all about me.

03:22.556 --> 03:25.559
The prosecution will no doubt
take delight in that,

03:25.592 --> 03:28.595
because you see,
I'm a terrible person.

03:28.629 --> 03:31.097
Paul Stewart, on the other hand,
is a good man.

03:31.131 --> 03:33.399
A kind one, innocent, too,

03:33.433 --> 03:35.702
and they make
for lousy defendants.

03:35.736 --> 03:37.137
Justice...

03:37.170 --> 03:38.639
it works better
when you get bad guys,

03:38.672 --> 03:40.073
not the innocent ones.

03:40.106 --> 03:41.341
And we here in Dedham--

03:41.374 --> 03:42.509
is it time for a break yet,
Judge,

03:42.543 --> 03:43.777
or shall I keep going?

03:44.310 --> 03:45.679
Keep going.

03:45.712 --> 03:48.481
We here in Dedham know
all about travesty, don't we?

03:48.515 --> 03:50.984
Dedham, this very courtroom,
in fact,

03:51.017 --> 03:53.787
is ground zero for one
of the worst miscarriages

03:53.820 --> 03:56.356
of justice
in American history.

03:56.389 --> 03:57.490
Two innocent men,

03:57.524 --> 04:00.366
Nicola Sacco
and Bartolomeo Vanzetti,

04:00.400 --> 04:03.537
were convicted, where we stand,

04:03.570 --> 04:05.171
for crimes
they didn't commit.

04:06.106 --> 04:07.173
Why?

04:07.207 --> 04:09.309
Because the police needed

04:09.342 --> 04:11.344
these murders solved.

04:11.377 --> 04:12.879
Because they--
MARCUS: Mr. Shore...

04:12.913 --> 04:15.115
I'm going to instruct you

04:15.148 --> 04:16.882
to stick to this trial.

04:22.255 --> 04:23.890
This trial...

04:23.924 --> 04:25.225
in a way...

04:25.258 --> 04:28.529
is about a second chance
for Dedham.

04:28.562 --> 04:29.763
In that other case, the one

04:29.796 --> 04:30.997
the judge doesn't want me
to talk about,

04:31.031 --> 04:33.800
we had Albert Einstein,
George Bernard Shaw,

04:33.833 --> 04:35.434
Justice Felix Frankfurter,
the pope even--

04:35.468 --> 04:38.171
the pope,
all writing letters to Dedham

04:38.204 --> 04:39.573
begging for justice.

04:39.606 --> 04:42.108
Pleading that we set
those two innocent men free.

04:42.142 --> 04:43.644
Dedham didn't do that.

04:44.344 --> 04:46.947
On August 23, 1927,

04:46.980 --> 04:48.882
Sacco and Vanzetti
were put to death.

04:48.915 --> 04:50.917
Dedham didn't get it right.

04:53.554 --> 04:55.556
Today, we have, yet again,

04:55.589 --> 04:57.190
an innocent man on trial,

04:58.525 --> 05:00.634
and this time,

05:00.667 --> 05:02.435
we need Dedham
to get it right.

05:06.106 --> 05:09.943
(music playing)

05:45.812 --> 05:47.480
KEVIN: Her eyes
were open and vacant

05:47.514 --> 05:48.782
when we got there,

05:48.815 --> 05:50.684
and her head was like all...

05:50.717 --> 05:52.619
bashed in and mushed.

05:52.653 --> 05:55.321
We found the defendant's semen
in her vaginal area,

05:55.355 --> 05:57.991
we found strands of his hair
on her person,

05:58.024 --> 06:00.433
and we found his oil secretions
on her person.

06:00.466 --> 06:02.368
But you, in fact,
suspected Paul Stewart

06:02.402 --> 06:05.405
even before the blood
and hair analysis.

06:05.438 --> 06:07.741
Yes, because a witness
placed him at the scene.

06:07.774 --> 06:10.043
In fact, the witness placed him
at the scene

06:10.076 --> 06:11.912
on many occasions.

06:11.945 --> 06:13.680
We suspected the affair

06:13.714 --> 06:16.382
and when we first went
to question Mr. Stewart,

06:16.416 --> 06:18.218
his lawyer just so happened
to be there.

06:18.251 --> 06:20.987
I believe Mr. Stewart
has a constitutional right

06:21.021 --> 06:23.223
to counsel
and I'd remind the court

06:23.256 --> 06:25.091
this is the United States
of America.

06:25.125 --> 06:26.860
Forgive me.

06:26.893 --> 06:28.595
I'm sorry, I was thinking
about the old America,

06:28.629 --> 06:29.730
sorry.

06:29.763 --> 06:32.132
MARCUS: Mr. Shore,
the court does not intend

06:32.165 --> 06:35.268
to tolerate your distractions.

06:35.301 --> 06:36.402
CLARKE: I have nothing further,
Judge.

06:38.705 --> 06:41.174
MARCUS: All right, Mr. Shore,

06:41.207 --> 06:42.943
now it's your turn.

06:42.976 --> 06:44.310
Thank you, Your Honor.

06:46.713 --> 06:47.781
Well, detective.

06:47.814 --> 06:48.982
So how are we today?

06:49.015 --> 06:50.483
Fine.

06:50.517 --> 06:52.619
Tell me, would you
regard yourself

06:52.653 --> 06:53.787
as a good detective?

06:53.820 --> 06:55.689
Yes.
You would.

06:55.722 --> 06:59.292
So all the evidence
that exists against my client,

06:59.325 --> 07:00.701
we should figure you to have it.

07:02.235 --> 07:03.036
Well...

07:03.069 --> 07:04.170
you say a witness placed

07:04.204 --> 07:05.271
Mr. Stewart at the scene.

07:05.305 --> 07:06.439
That witness would be
Catherine Piper?

07:06.472 --> 07:07.674
KEVIN: Yes.

07:07.708 --> 07:08.542
SHORE: Would you stand,
Catherine?

07:10.677 --> 07:12.646
Is this witness the heart
of your detectiving?

07:12.679 --> 07:14.881
KEVIN: No, she merely
supports my findings.

07:14.915 --> 07:16.950
The heart would be
the physical evidence

07:16.983 --> 07:19.185
linking the defendant
to the case.

07:20.253 --> 07:21.421
Ah, the physical evidence.

07:21.454 --> 07:23.524
You mean, like,
the murder weapon?

07:23.557 --> 07:25.125
Where is the murder weapon,
by the way?

07:25.158 --> 07:26.627
We didn't find it.

07:26.660 --> 07:27.961
You didn't find it?

07:27.994 --> 07:29.563
He obviously ditched it.

07:29.596 --> 07:30.597
Ditched it?

07:30.631 --> 07:32.132
Where?

07:32.165 --> 07:33.634
You claim you've been able
to plot out

07:33.667 --> 07:36.002
the exact route and timeline.

07:36.036 --> 07:37.804
My client went
from Brenda's house,

07:37.838 --> 07:39.840
to church,
to his mother's house,

07:39.873 --> 07:40.841
to his own house,

07:40.874 --> 07:41.942
where he stayed till morning.

07:41.975 --> 07:43.476
At which point,
he went to his office

07:43.510 --> 07:44.778
and from there
the police station.

07:44.811 --> 07:46.547
So, where did he ditch it?

07:46.580 --> 07:48.148
We don't know.

07:48.181 --> 07:49.382
SHORE: You don't know.

07:49.415 --> 07:51.652
That's disturbing.

07:51.685 --> 07:53.086
Let's turn to the victim then.

07:53.119 --> 07:54.354
Brenda Wilbur,

07:54.387 --> 07:56.222
where is she?

07:56.256 --> 07:58.525
The body was inadvertently
destroyed

07:58.559 --> 08:01.167
but the autopsy
had been completed.

08:01.201 --> 08:04.237
Gee, no body, no murder weapon.

08:04.270 --> 08:06.507
Well, lucky for us
we have a good detective.

08:06.540 --> 08:07.508
Objection.
SHORE: So let me

08:07.541 --> 08:08.542
get this straight,

08:08.575 --> 08:11.044
by physical evidence,
you mean...

08:11.077 --> 08:12.378
For starters, his semen.

08:12.412 --> 08:13.479
I see.

08:13.514 --> 08:15.381
And his semen would explain

08:15.415 --> 08:18.318
a, making love to her
or b, killing her

08:18.351 --> 08:21.021
or c, loading zone
for passengers only?

08:21.054 --> 08:22.789
It means that he was there.

08:22.823 --> 08:25.291
But he could have been there
hours earlier, couldn't he?

08:25.325 --> 08:28.194
His hairs were on her,
and his oil secretions.

08:28.228 --> 08:30.430
Tell me, detective, honestly.

08:30.463 --> 08:32.933
You actually found
his hair samples

08:32.966 --> 08:34.668
and body oil secretions

08:34.701 --> 08:36.636
right on the victim?
Yes.

08:36.669 --> 08:37.904
SHORE: As she lay there dead?
Yes.

08:37.938 --> 08:38.772
You're sure.
Yes.

08:38.804 --> 08:39.706
Well then...

08:39.740 --> 08:41.341
I can see why
you suspected him.

08:42.842 --> 08:44.210
Nothing further.

08:46.246 --> 08:47.581
Oh, I'm curious.

08:47.614 --> 08:49.750
Did you find anybody else's hair

08:49.783 --> 08:51.652
or body oil secretions
on the victim?

08:51.685 --> 08:53.319
Say, for example, mine?

08:56.590 --> 08:58.659
Did you find my hair
and oil secretions

08:58.692 --> 09:00.534
on the corpse, detective?

09:00.567 --> 09:02.836
Yes, because you fainted
on it.

09:02.869 --> 09:05.405
SHORE: Well, why didn't you
question me?

09:05.438 --> 09:06.840
I certainly had motive.

09:06.873 --> 09:08.374
I'm the one person in town
she didn't sleep with.

09:08.408 --> 09:09.275
Maybe I killed her.

09:09.309 --> 09:10.476
CLARKE: Objection.
You think you're funny?

09:10.511 --> 09:12.813
Any of your hair and fibers
on her, detective?

09:12.846 --> 09:15.315
Because I helped you up
after you fainted.

09:15.348 --> 09:18.619
So there was evidence
of you on the victim?

09:18.652 --> 09:21.487
Detective,
you led this jury to believe

09:21.522 --> 09:23.890
there was evidence
of Paul Stewart

09:23.924 --> 09:26.693
and only Paul Stewart
on the body.

09:26.727 --> 09:28.895
That wasn't honest.

09:28.929 --> 09:31.031
I won't call you a liar
but who feeds your pigs?

09:31.064 --> 09:31.798
CLARKE: Objection.

09:31.832 --> 09:33.233
SHORE: Sustained.

09:33.266 --> 09:35.335
So, let's see.

09:35.368 --> 09:36.970
I could be a suspect.

09:37.003 --> 09:38.539
How about Catherine Piper?

09:38.572 --> 09:39.840
She hated Brenda.

09:39.873 --> 09:40.974
Stand up, Catherine.

09:42.008 --> 09:43.109
Did you investigate her?

09:43.143 --> 09:44.878
No.
You can sit down, Catherine.

09:44.911 --> 09:45.946
Wendy, hi.

09:45.979 --> 09:47.313
Would you stand up, please.

09:47.914 --> 09:49.015
Scorned wife,

09:49.049 --> 09:50.250
she certainly had a motive.

09:50.283 --> 09:51.652
No alibi, I'm told.

09:51.685 --> 09:52.686
Did you check her out?

09:53.453 --> 09:54.320
I'm sure you didn't.

09:54.354 --> 09:55.121
You can sit down.

09:55.155 --> 09:56.122
Thank you, Wendy.

09:56.156 --> 09:57.390
So many suspects.

09:57.423 --> 09:59.059
Let's not forget you, Kev.

09:59.092 --> 09:59.960
Stand up, judge.

09:59.993 --> 10:01.301
Dah, never mind.

10:01.334 --> 10:02.936
But you get my point,
don't you, detective?

10:02.969 --> 10:05.371
You really only looked
at one person, didn't you?

10:06.607 --> 10:08.074
Three years of fifth grade.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.110
We expected better.
Shoddy work, Detective.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.912
Objection.
SHORE: Sustained.

10:13.379 --> 10:14.981
I'm very disappointed.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.620
Is that why you wanted me
in the room?

10:19.653 --> 10:21.087
So you could point to me
as a possible suspect?

10:21.121 --> 10:22.322
I wanted you in the room

10:22.355 --> 10:24.190
to help secure an acquittal
for your husband.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.759
We do want that,
don't we, Wendy?

10:27.060 --> 10:28.228
CATHERINE: Hello.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.764
I want you to know

10:30.797 --> 10:33.800
I don't mind
being a suspect at all.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.669
It gives me edge.

10:35.702 --> 10:38.338
SHORE: Catherine, I'm having
a private conversation here.

10:39.540 --> 10:42.142
Well, don't dillydally, dear.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.477
My testimony's up next.

10:44.511 --> 10:46.747
We certainly
don't want to miss that.

10:53.386 --> 10:54.955
He would come to her house

10:54.988 --> 10:57.724
at least three times a week.

10:57.758 --> 11:00.400
He'd park on the corner
of Milton and Tobey

11:00.433 --> 11:02.035
and then he'd walk a block.

11:02.068 --> 11:03.570
Three times a week?

11:03.604 --> 11:05.138
Yes,

11:05.171 --> 11:07.307
to have lascivious sex
with her.

11:07.340 --> 11:10.243
CLARKE: Miss Piper, on the day
Brenda Wilbur was murdered--

11:10.276 --> 11:11.578
He was there.

11:11.612 --> 11:12.613
CLARKE: When?

11:12.646 --> 11:13.580
CATHERINE: Well...

11:13.614 --> 11:15.315
he came in the afternoon

11:15.348 --> 11:17.383
and then...

11:17.417 --> 11:19.185
I saw him return that night,

11:19.219 --> 11:20.420
before 10:00.

11:21.722 --> 11:22.723
Objection.

11:22.756 --> 11:24.057
On what grounds?

11:24.090 --> 11:25.191
From my...

11:25.225 --> 11:26.426
interview with the witness.

11:26.459 --> 11:28.862
I believe she's misspoken.

11:28.895 --> 11:30.296
No, I haven't.

11:30.330 --> 11:32.432
Could I be allowed to finish?

11:32.465 --> 11:33.900
Sit, Mr. Shore.

11:36.169 --> 11:38.204
CLARKE:
You saw him return at 10:00 pm.

11:38.238 --> 11:39.439
CATHERINE: Yes.
CLARKE: On the night

11:39.472 --> 11:40.406
Brenda Wilbur was murdered?

11:40.440 --> 11:41.608
Yes.

11:41.642 --> 11:42.776
CLARKE: And when did he leave?

11:43.610 --> 11:45.812
Just after 10:30.

11:45.846 --> 11:46.913
And he was running

11:46.947 --> 11:48.949
like there was something
terribly wrong.

11:48.982 --> 11:50.817
CLARKE: Now, Miss Piper,

11:50.851 --> 11:53.019
when the police
first questioned you,

11:53.053 --> 11:54.420
you said nothing

11:54.454 --> 11:56.289
about the defendant
being there that night.

11:56.322 --> 11:59.926
Because Victoria Stewart,
Paul's mother,

11:59.960 --> 12:02.503
paid me $600,000 not to.

12:05.606 --> 12:06.707
We're dead.

12:07.974 --> 12:09.475
CLARKE:
The mother of the defendant

12:09.510 --> 12:11.978
paid you $600,000.

12:12.012 --> 12:14.515
And I'm so ashamed to say
I took it.

12:15.849 --> 12:17.217
I think that's why Mr. Shore

12:17.250 --> 12:19.553
was expecting me to lie
just now.

12:19.586 --> 12:22.355
But my conscience
simply got the better of me.

12:22.388 --> 12:24.290
That's why I came to you.

12:24.324 --> 12:27.060
I'm not the noblest of people.

12:27.093 --> 12:29.530
I'm obviously
not above extortion,

12:29.563 --> 12:31.565
or even lying,

12:31.598 --> 12:33.767
but I just couldn't lie

12:33.800 --> 12:36.436
to help somebody get away
with murder.

12:37.103 --> 12:38.539
No, I can't do that.

12:40.507 --> 12:41.675
Thank you, ma'am.

12:51.952 --> 12:53.119
Hello, Catherine.

12:53.153 --> 12:54.588
Hello.

12:54.621 --> 12:56.022
Tell me, Catherine.

12:56.056 --> 12:58.258
How do you feel
about Victoria Stewart?

12:58.291 --> 13:01.602
Why, I loathe her,
of course.

13:01.635 --> 13:03.003
As does everyone else
in this town.

13:03.036 --> 13:04.805
SHORE: Yes, and in fact,

13:04.838 --> 13:06.106
I bet it occurred to you,

13:06.139 --> 13:08.241
you could get
the extortion money

13:08.274 --> 13:09.910
and still bring her down

13:09.943 --> 13:10.977
by going to the police.

13:11.011 --> 13:13.847
Why, yes,
that was exactly my thinking.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.749
Just for fun, could you tell us

13:15.782 --> 13:17.618
your opinion of Brenda Wilbur?

13:17.651 --> 13:19.285
She was a godless whore.

13:19.319 --> 13:21.054
SHORE: In fact,
you complained to the police

13:21.087 --> 13:22.556
about all the men
she entertained.

13:22.589 --> 13:26.159
Tell me, did you ever recognize
any of these men?

13:26.192 --> 13:28.895
I don't associate
with those kinds of people.

13:28.929 --> 13:32.265
I see,
so in reviewing your testimony,

13:32.298 --> 13:35.569
you hated Brenda,
you hate Victoria,

13:35.602 --> 13:37.738
and, in fact, extorted her,

13:37.771 --> 13:40.841
you saw a lot of men
enter and leave

13:40.874 --> 13:43.977
what eventually turned out
to be the murder scene.

13:44.010 --> 13:47.548
But the only one
you seem to remember

13:47.581 --> 13:48.849
is my client.

13:49.716 --> 13:51.652
I guess that's pretty much it,
right?

13:51.685 --> 13:53.920
You didn't see anybody

13:53.954 --> 13:56.857
commit any crime, did you?

13:56.890 --> 13:58.892
No, but I'm sure he did it.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.667
SHORE: I see.

14:00.701 --> 14:01.602
By the way...

14:01.635 --> 14:04.404
when you and I said hello
a few weeks ago,

14:04.437 --> 14:05.606
we shook hands.

14:05.639 --> 14:07.508
You had something on your glove.

14:07.541 --> 14:08.842
Do you remember, what that was?

14:08.875 --> 14:10.777
Dog crap.
SHORE: Yes.

14:10.811 --> 14:12.713
Do you remember why

14:12.746 --> 14:15.682
you reached for my hand
with dog stool on yours?

14:15.716 --> 14:18.351
Because you put dog stool
in a bag

14:18.384 --> 14:20.086
and left in on my doorstep.

14:20.120 --> 14:22.122
And you ruined
my fleece slippers.

14:22.155 --> 14:23.524
This happened when?

14:23.557 --> 14:25.391
In 1971.

14:25.425 --> 14:28.629
So you were getting even
for a Halloween prank

14:28.662 --> 14:30.363
I pulled when I was 9.

14:30.396 --> 14:31.532
Yes.

14:31.565 --> 14:34.535
You hate godless whores

14:34.568 --> 14:36.870
and you're a fan of vengeance.

14:36.903 --> 14:38.972
I am a Christian, dear.

14:40.240 --> 14:43.176
(church bell ringing)

14:45.111 --> 14:47.080
I'm not breaking any seal.

14:47.113 --> 14:48.715
SHORE: I'm not asking you to.

14:49.516 --> 14:51.685
But you could verify
that Brenda Wilbur

14:51.718 --> 14:54.054
was a sexually aggressive woman

14:54.087 --> 14:57.490
who got herself into situations.

14:57.524 --> 14:58.559
How would I know that?

14:58.592 --> 15:00.701
SHORE: Tom, we're desperate.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.636
I may have to ask you--
I'll lie.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.270
No, you won't.

15:04.304 --> 15:05.806
It's not in your character.

15:06.740 --> 15:08.208
You gave me your word.

15:09.576 --> 15:10.744
I realize that.

15:10.777 --> 15:12.679
If I had something to say
that would help Paul--

15:12.713 --> 15:14.214
You do.
I don't.

15:17.851 --> 15:18.919
The only thing that would come

15:18.952 --> 15:20.286
from my little admission...

15:21.888 --> 15:24.525
is the destruction of my church,

15:24.558 --> 15:25.826
my parish...

15:27.327 --> 15:28.862
and me, and I won't do it.

15:31.031 --> 15:32.398
I will lie

15:32.432 --> 15:34.267
and I'll be believed.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.771
And your case will just look
all the more desperate.

15:37.804 --> 15:39.439
I may have
to take that chance.

15:39.472 --> 15:40.541
You'll regret it.

15:42.208 --> 15:43.409
I promise you.

15:57.558 --> 15:59.059
There's no reason to panic.

15:59.092 --> 16:00.100
No reason?

16:00.133 --> 16:01.101
The jury just heard
that my mother

16:01.134 --> 16:02.102
tried to bribe a witness.

16:02.135 --> 16:03.870
Your mother did, you didn't.

16:03.904 --> 16:05.071
PAUL: I am dead, Tara.

16:05.105 --> 16:06.339
We still have a witness

16:06.372 --> 16:07.808
who thought that he saw a woman.

16:07.841 --> 16:08.875
We still have your testimony--

16:08.909 --> 16:09.710
My testimony--

16:09.743 --> 16:12.078
Not to forget--listen, Paul--

16:12.112 --> 16:14.080
PAUL: Don't handle me, Tara.

16:14.114 --> 16:16.249
You know, I realize
that's your assignment here

16:16.282 --> 16:18.384
to handhold the client,
but don't.

16:19.520 --> 16:20.654
My assignment isn't...

16:22.188 --> 16:23.857
to handhold the client.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.096
Let me ask you something, Tara.

16:32.599 --> 16:34.334
Do you think I'm innocent?

16:37.037 --> 16:38.071
Yes.

16:41.908 --> 16:43.076
Yes.

16:45.245 --> 16:46.312
Paul...

16:48.214 --> 16:49.215
VICTORIA: Paul?

16:52.085 --> 16:54.921
Could I have a moment
with Ms. Wilson, please?

16:55.589 --> 16:56.389
Why?

16:56.422 --> 16:58.024
I'd like a moment.

17:05.471 --> 17:06.707
(sighs)

17:15.448 --> 17:18.218
You and I
had a certain discussion.

17:18.785 --> 17:21.788
My son has a family,
Ms. Wilson.

17:21.821 --> 17:23.790
Despite this temporary setback,

17:23.824 --> 17:26.560
Paul Stewart
is a respected doctor

17:26.593 --> 17:29.963
and family man
in this community.

17:29.996 --> 17:32.365
That is the reputation
he once had

17:32.398 --> 17:34.400
and will have again,

17:34.434 --> 17:35.335
Ms. Wilson.

17:36.637 --> 17:39.439
I am confident
you don't mean to interfere

17:39.472 --> 17:40.507
with that.

17:47.180 --> 17:48.448
TOM: I was actually
getting ready to go home

17:48.481 --> 17:49.883
when he came in.

17:49.916 --> 17:51.251
CLARKE: This was around?

17:51.284 --> 17:53.019
11:00 or so.

17:53.053 --> 17:54.020
Maybe a little bit earlier.

17:54.054 --> 17:55.956
Father, can you describe

17:55.989 --> 17:57.858
the defendant as he entered
your church that night?

17:59.860 --> 18:01.201
He seemed agitated.

18:01.234 --> 18:02.536
Agitated?

18:04.771 --> 18:06.339
Did he say anything?

18:06.372 --> 18:08.341
He asked if he could go
into the confessional.

18:08.374 --> 18:09.976
CLARKE:
Did something seem wrong?

18:10.010 --> 18:11.344
Yes.

18:11.377 --> 18:12.813
Did you go
into the confessional?

18:13.580 --> 18:14.715
No.

18:14.748 --> 18:16.717
He saw a member
of the cleaning crew.

18:16.750 --> 18:18.852
He seemed to panic

18:18.885 --> 18:20.787
and he ran out of the church.

18:20.821 --> 18:23.389
And this was on
or around 11:00 p. m.

18:23.423 --> 18:25.125
the night that Brenda Wilbur
was murdered?

18:25.626 --> 18:26.627
Yes.

18:27.193 --> 18:28.228
Thank you, Father.

18:34.367 --> 18:36.903
This agitation,
in your opinion,

18:36.937 --> 18:39.640
could it be consistent with Paul

18:39.673 --> 18:42.242
seeing Brenda's murdered body,

18:42.275 --> 18:43.476
a woman he loved,

18:43.510 --> 18:45.746
being emotionally traumatized
by what he saw?

18:45.779 --> 18:47.748
Something that made him run
to his clergy.

18:47.781 --> 18:50.684
Yes, it could be consistent
with all of that.

18:50.717 --> 18:52.018
Father...

18:52.052 --> 18:54.888
Brenda Wilbur led a rather
promiscuous life, didn't she?

18:54.921 --> 18:57.457
She was involved
with various men,

18:57.490 --> 18:58.792
any number of whom,

18:58.825 --> 19:00.601
could have come to her house
that night.

19:01.367 --> 19:02.402
I wouldn't know.

19:03.036 --> 19:03.837
You wouldn't know?

19:05.271 --> 19:06.840
You were her priest,
were you not?

19:06.873 --> 19:08.775
I was.

19:08.809 --> 19:10.410
Did she not indicate

19:10.443 --> 19:13.079
her propensity to seduce men?

19:14.014 --> 19:15.882
I cannot break
the confessional seal.

19:17.250 --> 19:18.752
I'm bound by canon law.

19:20.220 --> 19:21.855
Were you ever able
to observe her

19:21.888 --> 19:24.024
outside the confessional?

19:24.057 --> 19:25.759
Something you could talk about.

19:26.993 --> 19:28.094
No.

19:42.042 --> 19:43.777
Father, may I ask,

19:47.247 --> 19:49.950
were you ever romantically
intimate with Brenda Wilbur?

19:56.356 --> 19:58.692
Father, I asked you a question.

19:58.725 --> 20:00.834
I'll need to insist
on an answer.

20:00.867 --> 20:03.970
Did you have sex
with Brenda Wilbur?

20:06.372 --> 20:07.440
MARCUS: Father...

20:08.675 --> 20:10.677
we need a response.

20:16.583 --> 20:17.818
Yes...

20:19.419 --> 20:20.353
I did.

20:26.459 --> 20:28.762
Was it she who seduced you?

20:30.931 --> 20:32.098
Yes.

20:32.132 --> 20:35.135
Did she ever threaten
to expose this

20:36.202 --> 20:39.105
to bring shame upon you
and your parish?

20:40.473 --> 20:42.108
No...

20:42.142 --> 20:43.376
she did not.

21:06.840 --> 21:08.809
The other night,
I came up here to sit.

21:11.211 --> 21:13.580
I was pretending
we were 10 years old again.

21:16.116 --> 21:17.317
With everything ahead of us.

21:19.019 --> 21:20.687
I've always believed
life should come

21:20.721 --> 21:22.623
with one free "do over."

21:27.928 --> 21:28.895
Are we gonna win?

21:41.842 --> 21:42.776
Listen,

21:42.809 --> 21:44.210
our defense has shifted
a little.

21:45.078 --> 21:46.780
After I call Paul,
I'm calling you.

21:46.813 --> 21:47.881
Me?

21:47.914 --> 21:48.815
You need to explain

21:48.849 --> 21:50.617
why you bribed Catherine Piper.

21:51.785 --> 21:53.019
You need to convince the jury

21:53.053 --> 21:54.688
Paul had nothing to do
with that.

21:54.721 --> 21:57.190
I thought the idea
was to distance me

21:57.223 --> 21:58.058
from the defense.
SHORE: Well,

21:58.091 --> 21:59.760
you've made that impossible.

22:07.874 --> 22:10.343
PAUL: We had made love that day.

22:10.376 --> 22:11.344
Evening, really,

22:11.377 --> 22:12.613
it was around 6:00.

22:12.646 --> 22:16.182
I left,
returned around 10:00

22:16.216 --> 22:17.784
after I couldn't get her
on the phone.

22:18.919 --> 22:20.220
And then I found her.

22:20.253 --> 22:21.087
Dead?

22:21.121 --> 22:22.455
Yes.

22:23.890 --> 22:25.025
Then what did you do?

22:25.058 --> 22:26.560
I was experiencing panic.

22:26.593 --> 22:28.094
Panic?

22:28.128 --> 22:29.062
I'm--

22:30.230 --> 22:31.497
I was a married man,

22:31.532 --> 22:32.999
a family man,

22:33.033 --> 22:34.668
I had a lot riding
in this community

22:34.701 --> 22:36.803
that stemmed from leading
a life of integrity.

22:38.004 --> 22:40.273
I think I felt
my life imploding.

22:40.306 --> 22:42.175
Why didn't you call the police?

22:42.208 --> 22:44.210
Clearly, I should have.

22:44.244 --> 22:46.547
There was nothing I could do
to help Brenda.

22:47.681 --> 22:49.716
As I said, I panicked
and I ran to Tom.

22:49.750 --> 22:52.152
Father Dugan?
PAUL: Yes.

22:52.185 --> 22:53.453
I went to the church,

22:53.486 --> 22:55.789
I think, I guess to...

22:55.822 --> 22:58.224
seek counsel or support.

22:58.258 --> 22:59.459
And then when I got
to the church,

22:59.492 --> 23:01.001
I saw somebody
from the cleaning crew

23:01.034 --> 23:02.268
and I panicked once again.

23:02.302 --> 23:03.870
I ran to my mother's.

23:03.904 --> 23:05.606
What did you do there?

23:05.639 --> 23:08.108
PAUL: There's a tree house
in the woods

23:08.141 --> 23:09.843
out back that I built

23:09.876 --> 23:11.077
as a child with you, actually.

23:12.212 --> 23:15.215
It's a hideout from the world.

23:16.717 --> 23:19.152
I think I went there
to seek refuge, I guess.

23:19.185 --> 23:20.954
Paul, how long
had you been having

23:20.987 --> 23:22.222
an affair with Brenda?

23:22.255 --> 23:23.890
It was two years.

23:23.924 --> 23:27.227
SHORE: Do you know if there
were other men in her life?

23:27.260 --> 23:29.062
I believe there were, yes.

23:30.330 --> 23:32.232
But she would never tell me
because...

23:32.265 --> 23:33.800
Because why?

23:33.834 --> 23:35.401
Because she knew I loved her.

23:38.672 --> 23:39.640
Did you kill her?

23:39.673 --> 23:41.542
No.

23:41.575 --> 23:43.276
I was there that night

23:43.309 --> 23:44.945
but I didn't kill her

23:44.978 --> 23:46.747
and I didn't see who did.

23:47.914 --> 23:49.415
CLARKE: You find a loved one

23:49.449 --> 23:51.417
lying in a pool of blood,

23:51.451 --> 23:52.653
you don't call an ambulance,

23:52.686 --> 23:54.420
you don't call the police,

23:54.454 --> 23:55.355
you just leave.

23:55.388 --> 23:56.623
I knew she was dead.

23:56.657 --> 23:58.258
And as for the police, I--

23:58.291 --> 24:00.934
my family name in this town--
Oh, yes,

24:00.967 --> 24:01.802
the family name.

24:02.803 --> 24:03.937
Tell me about
this tree house you built?

24:05.438 --> 24:06.773
You're into carpentry, doctor?

24:06.807 --> 24:07.774
It's a hobby.

24:07.808 --> 24:09.375
Hobby?

24:09.409 --> 24:12.613
Funny, we confiscated a toolbox
in the trunk of your car.

24:12.646 --> 24:13.847
Couldn't find a hammer.

24:13.880 --> 24:16.349
The toolbox was missing more
than just a hammer.

24:16.382 --> 24:17.718
It was also missing
several tools--

24:17.751 --> 24:19.185
But, notably, the hammer.

24:19.219 --> 24:21.522
I believe you seized
several hammers from my house.

24:21.555 --> 24:23.023
None that matched that set.

24:23.056 --> 24:24.490
PAUL: Look, you traced
my moves that night.

24:24.525 --> 24:26.660
If I had tossed or ditched

24:26.693 --> 24:28.128
a weapon--
CLARKE: Where's the hammer,

24:28.161 --> 24:29.563
Dr. Stewart?
Your Honor,

24:29.596 --> 24:31.297
I must object to this.
It's one thing

24:31.331 --> 24:33.099
not to have evidence,
it's quite another to try

24:33.133 --> 24:35.468
to prosecute with that
which you do not have.

24:35.502 --> 24:37.037
Well, I tell you,
I have a hammer.

24:37.070 --> 24:38.605
It's a hammer of justice,

24:38.639 --> 24:40.140
it's a hammer of freedom.

24:40.173 --> 24:41.207
It's a song about love

24:41.241 --> 24:42.676
between my brothers
and my sisters

24:42.709 --> 24:44.010
all over this land.

24:45.679 --> 24:47.480
Except, perhaps,
Dedham, Massachusetts.

24:51.718 --> 24:52.653
What?

24:56.322 --> 24:57.891
I have good news and bad news.

24:58.659 --> 24:59.693
SHORE: Bad news first.

25:00.767 --> 25:03.369
My focus group thinks Paul
is guilty.

25:04.037 --> 25:05.171
And the good?

25:05.205 --> 25:07.173
They love you.

25:08.709 --> 25:09.676
Splendid.

25:13.079 --> 25:14.781
Alan, we might want to think
about a plea.

25:14.815 --> 25:16.216
Okay.

25:18.785 --> 25:19.586
I think not.

25:19.620 --> 25:21.054
This focus group is obviously

25:21.087 --> 25:22.556
trying to tell us something.
SHORE: Jamie,

25:22.589 --> 25:24.224
try to understand this.

25:24.257 --> 25:26.126
If we plead out,

25:26.159 --> 25:27.994
I don't get to
give my closing.

25:28.028 --> 25:29.863
And I've practiced it, so.

25:29.896 --> 25:33.133
You need to take this seriously.

25:33.166 --> 25:34.801
PAUL: Everybody out now.

25:34.835 --> 25:36.302
Except Alan.

25:37.938 --> 25:39.906
I'm the client, I get to call
the occasional shot.

25:39.940 --> 25:41.808
Everybody out now.

25:50.551 --> 25:52.853
(door closes)

25:52.886 --> 25:54.254
Seems like the old days.

25:55.989 --> 25:58.058
You and I getting
in all kinds of trouble

25:58.959 --> 26:00.601
and you having the time
of your life.

26:02.135 --> 26:03.737
I'm facing prison.

26:03.770 --> 26:05.672
I'm doing the very best I can.

26:08.509 --> 26:09.943
Is there a good deal
to be made here?

26:09.976 --> 26:12.546
For a guilty man,
I'm sure there's a terrific deal

26:12.579 --> 26:14.480
to be had.
For the innocent

26:14.515 --> 26:16.683
it would be despicably unfair.

26:16.717 --> 26:17.984
Which would you like, Paul?

26:18.018 --> 26:19.352
Good or bad?

26:19.385 --> 26:21.187
I didn't kill Brenda.

26:21.221 --> 26:22.288
I know you didn't.

26:22.322 --> 26:23.690
So let's not quit.

26:30.764 --> 26:32.398
I know it was a stupid thing
to do.

26:32.432 --> 26:33.767
SHORE: So why did you do it?

26:33.800 --> 26:36.336
I suppose I was afraid that...

26:36.369 --> 26:38.171
my son wouldn't get
a fair trial.

26:39.239 --> 26:41.642
I know how people think of me.

26:41.675 --> 26:43.209
SHORE: But, Victoria,
if you knew

26:43.243 --> 26:44.477
your son was innocent,

26:44.511 --> 26:45.979
why bribe a witness?

26:46.012 --> 26:47.981
Catherine Piper's so biased.

26:48.014 --> 26:49.616
I was...

26:49.650 --> 26:50.884
concerned that she'd paint

26:50.917 --> 26:52.285
the worst possible picture,

26:52.318 --> 26:52.986
And I--

26:54.755 --> 26:56.523
it was a bad idea.

26:56.557 --> 26:57.724
One that--

26:59.192 --> 27:01.034
I was probably...

27:01.067 --> 27:02.569
blinded a little...

27:02.603 --> 27:04.871
by my love for Paul.

27:04.905 --> 27:06.372
Your love for Paul.

27:06.406 --> 27:08.008
The perception is Paul

27:08.041 --> 27:10.210
is the most precious thing
in your life.

27:10.944 --> 27:12.746
Yes.

27:12.779 --> 27:14.948
As Paul's oldest friend,

27:14.981 --> 27:16.482
I've known you a very long time,

27:16.517 --> 27:17.350
haven't I?

27:17.383 --> 27:19.620
Yes, you have.

27:21.788 --> 27:24.525
SHORE: When I was 16 years old,

27:24.558 --> 27:26.059
you and I made love.

27:26.627 --> 27:27.928
Several times, in fact.

27:30.096 --> 27:31.397
(gavel bangs)

27:33.333 --> 27:35.335
(gavel banging)

27:39.305 --> 27:40.574
MARCUS: Mr. Shore,

27:40.607 --> 27:43.944
as riveted as I am and I am,

27:43.977 --> 27:45.011
I'm not sure this

27:45.045 --> 27:46.813
has anything to do
with this trial.

27:46.847 --> 27:48.782
I'm afraid it does,
Your Honor.

27:48.815 --> 27:50.216
Sleeping with me caused you

27:50.250 --> 27:52.018
a great deal of distress,

27:52.052 --> 27:52.786
didn't it, Victoria?

27:54.354 --> 27:55.989
As I recall,
you saw a therapist,

27:56.022 --> 27:58.491
and he opined you were perhaps,

27:58.525 --> 27:59.793
on some unconscious level,

27:59.826 --> 28:01.635
not so much making love to me

28:01.668 --> 28:02.536
but rather to Paul.

28:04.170 --> 28:06.907
Victoria, are you in love
with your son?

28:09.943 --> 28:11.878
That's ridiculous.
Is it?

28:11.912 --> 28:14.347
I once asked you
why you never remarried

28:14.380 --> 28:15.849
after your husband died.

28:15.882 --> 28:17.217
And your response was,

28:17.250 --> 28:19.152
"You know full well why."

28:19.185 --> 28:20.754
Was that an admission to me

28:20.787 --> 28:22.388
you were in love with your son?

28:23.156 --> 28:25.325
I love my son...

28:25.358 --> 28:27.728
the way a mother loves a child.

28:27.761 --> 28:29.630
It was never romantic love.

28:30.764 --> 28:32.599
Did you kill Brenda Wilbur?

28:33.934 --> 28:37.337
Brenda Wilbur was not only
compromising your son

28:37.370 --> 28:38.939
with a sordid affair,

28:38.972 --> 28:41.642
she was not only destroying
his family,

28:41.675 --> 28:42.876
his reputation,

28:42.909 --> 28:44.344
she was sleeping with the man

28:44.377 --> 28:45.746
you wanted to sleep with.

28:45.779 --> 28:47.213
That is sick.

28:48.481 --> 28:51.051
If I'm gonna be accused
of such depravity,

28:51.084 --> 28:52.919
I should like to consult
an attorney.

28:54.588 --> 28:56.222
That's all right, Victoria.

28:56.256 --> 28:57.624
I won't accuse you of anything.

29:17.283 --> 29:18.184
Well,

29:19.520 --> 29:20.320
that was wonderful.

29:23.056 --> 29:26.126
I guess, since paying off
the witness didn't work out,

29:27.528 --> 29:28.895
why not a little performance.

29:30.230 --> 29:31.898
And that was just wonderful.

29:31.932 --> 29:34.500
I guess we'll leave it at,

29:34.535 --> 29:37.871
you really,
really love your son.

29:44.945 --> 29:46.179
MARCUS: Mr. Shore?

29:47.113 --> 29:48.448
Defense rests, Your Honor.

30:02.636 --> 30:05.138
SHORE: Ideally, whenever a crime
is committed,

30:05.171 --> 30:07.407
the police should conduct
an open,

30:07.440 --> 30:09.175
thorough investigation...

30:09.209 --> 30:10.844
leading to a conclusion.

30:10.877 --> 30:12.378
In the best case scenario,

30:12.412 --> 30:13.814
the truth.

30:13.847 --> 30:16.149
But that presumes
having unlimited resources

30:16.182 --> 30:17.884
which clearly we don't.

30:17.918 --> 30:19.820
So, what often happens,

30:19.853 --> 30:21.622
we pick the most likely guy

30:21.655 --> 30:23.790
and exhaust what we've got
trying to nail him.

30:23.824 --> 30:26.126
That happened
80-plus years ago

30:26.159 --> 30:27.594
with Sacco and Vanzetti,

30:27.628 --> 30:29.630
it's happening here
with Paul Stewart.

30:29.663 --> 30:31.565
Every year,

30:31.598 --> 30:34.134
10,000 innocent people

30:34.167 --> 30:36.570
are convicted in this country.

30:36.603 --> 30:38.204
That's according to one study.

30:38.238 --> 30:39.706
Others say that figure is low.

30:39.740 --> 30:41.441
That's staggering.

30:42.576 --> 30:43.877
It's disgraceful.

30:45.078 --> 30:47.313
Ten thousand

30:47.347 --> 30:50.416
wrongful convictions every year.

30:51.785 --> 30:52.853
Why?

30:52.886 --> 30:55.956
Mainly because juries

30:55.989 --> 30:58.992
don't insist
on finding guilt

30:59.025 --> 31:01.334
beyond all reasonable doubt.

31:01.367 --> 31:03.236
When a person is killed,

31:03.269 --> 31:04.938
we want somebody convicted.

31:04.971 --> 31:06.439
It's human nature.

31:06.472 --> 31:08.642
There's closure in saying
a crime has been solved.

31:08.675 --> 31:10.611
There's also safety in it.

31:10.644 --> 31:11.878
We like to go to bed at night

31:11.912 --> 31:13.246
thinking the bad guy
has been captured,

31:13.279 --> 31:14.948
especially in small towns

31:14.981 --> 31:16.983
where we're desperate
to feel safe.

31:17.017 --> 31:19.720
Please, let Paul Stewart
be the guy.

31:19.753 --> 31:21.922
He must be the guy.

31:22.989 --> 31:23.990
He's not the guy.

31:26.593 --> 31:27.661
So, who is?

31:32.032 --> 31:33.967
Catherine Piper
is a lunatic

31:34.000 --> 31:35.836
who not only derives glee

31:35.869 --> 31:37.738
in making the Stewart
family suffer,

31:37.771 --> 31:40.040
she hated the victim as well.

31:41.107 --> 31:42.576
And she just so happened to live

31:42.609 --> 31:44.010
right across the street
from her.

31:45.378 --> 31:46.547
Wendy Stewart...

31:46.580 --> 31:47.581
had motive.

31:48.649 --> 31:51.718
She was angry and hurt.

31:51.752 --> 31:53.554
Betrayed wives have certainly

31:53.587 --> 31:55.388
been known to react
with violence.

31:55.421 --> 31:57.891
And she has no alibi.

31:59.860 --> 32:01.568
Father Tom Dugan.

32:01.602 --> 32:03.937
He had illicit sex
with the victim.

32:03.970 --> 32:06.339
She had a history
of committing extortion,

32:06.372 --> 32:08.241
he had everything to lose.

32:08.274 --> 32:09.409
And let's not forget Victoria.

32:09.442 --> 32:11.878
Obsessed with her son's life,

32:11.912 --> 32:12.946
his reputation,

32:12.979 --> 32:14.915
his legacy.

32:14.948 --> 32:17.684
Or simply obsessed
with her son.

32:17.718 --> 32:19.520
The point is, people,

32:19.553 --> 32:20.754
there are many

32:20.787 --> 32:23.189
potential suspects
in this case.

32:23.223 --> 32:25.692
And that would include
all the strangers

32:25.726 --> 32:26.860
in Brenda Wilbur's life.

32:26.893 --> 32:28.862
We know nothing
of the nature

32:28.895 --> 32:31.197
and disposition
of those relationships,

32:31.231 --> 32:33.600
of the possible jealousies
and betrayals

32:33.634 --> 32:35.468
precisely because...

32:35.501 --> 32:38.304
they were never investigated.

32:38.338 --> 32:41.041
Paul Stewart represented

32:41.074 --> 32:43.443
only a small fraction

32:43.476 --> 32:44.678
of this woman's life.

32:44.711 --> 32:46.580
If this jury

32:46.613 --> 32:48.615
is going to insist

32:48.649 --> 32:49.950
on finding guilt

32:49.983 --> 32:51.718
beyond all reasonable doubt,

32:51.752 --> 32:54.120
Paul Stewart must be acquitted.

32:55.321 --> 32:57.490
Nobody witnessed this crime
being committed.

32:57.524 --> 32:59.826
The murder weapon
was never found,

32:59.860 --> 33:01.735
despite the police tracing

33:01.768 --> 33:03.570
my client's every step.

33:03.604 --> 33:07.073
Prosecution inadvertently
destroyed the victim's body

33:07.107 --> 33:08.842
before we could properly
examine it.

33:08.875 --> 33:10.644
Of course,
there's reasonable doubt.

33:11.945 --> 33:13.446
Reasonable doubt.

33:21.555 --> 33:24.257
I love Paul Stewart
as I would a brother.

33:25.491 --> 33:26.793
I grew up with him.

33:28.194 --> 33:30.731
It's one of the reasons
I know he's innocent.

33:33.233 --> 33:34.601
He's not infallible,

33:35.802 --> 33:37.504
he had an affair.

33:37.538 --> 33:39.372
It may cost him his marriage,

33:39.405 --> 33:41.474
perhaps the respect
of his children.

33:41.508 --> 33:42.876
But he did not--

33:42.909 --> 33:45.879
Paul could not take the life

33:45.912 --> 33:47.848
of another human being.

33:47.881 --> 33:49.415
He simply could not.

33:54.855 --> 33:56.322
This may surprise you.

33:59.660 --> 34:01.535
I love Dedham, Massachusetts.

34:03.403 --> 34:04.571
I grew up here.

34:07.107 --> 34:08.842
I'm offended...

34:08.875 --> 34:11.945
by its legacy of convicting
innocent people

34:11.978 --> 34:14.080
because I know
that's not who we are.

34:18.719 --> 34:20.485
This time,

34:20.521 --> 34:22.355
let's set the innocent man free.

34:40.907 --> 34:43.810
CLARKE: Rarely do we
actually see somebody...

34:43.844 --> 34:45.210
commit the crime.

34:45.245 --> 34:48.447
Typically, criminal cases
are circumstantial.

34:48.481 --> 34:52.085
Now, the circumstances here

34:52.118 --> 34:53.253
are that the defendant

34:53.286 --> 34:56.121
had an affair with the victim.

34:56.156 --> 34:58.458
There was evidence
that she tried to extort him.

34:59.593 --> 35:02.168
He had incentive to protect
his family name,

35:02.202 --> 35:03.704
and his community status.

35:03.737 --> 35:05.271
His hair,

35:05.305 --> 35:07.473
fibers, body oils were found

35:07.508 --> 35:09.409
all over the victim.

35:09.442 --> 35:11.411
His semen was found
in the victim.

35:12.412 --> 35:14.047
Blood all over his clothes.

35:14.080 --> 35:16.249
He was spotted leaving
the scene.

35:18.084 --> 35:20.253
That is overwhelming

35:20.286 --> 35:22.623
circumstantial evidence,
ladies and gentlemen.

35:22.656 --> 35:24.157
And it certainly allows you

35:24.190 --> 35:26.026
to find guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt.

35:26.059 --> 35:27.528
Now, I suspect
the defense counsel

35:27.561 --> 35:30.096
already knows that,
which is why

35:30.130 --> 35:33.133
he began finger-pointing
elsewhere, everywhere.

35:33.166 --> 35:35.636
Oh, hey,
maybe an eyewitness did it.

35:35.669 --> 35:37.738
Oh, perhaps the priest.

35:37.771 --> 35:39.706
Hey, how about the defendant's
own mother?

35:41.007 --> 35:42.475
And to compound
this blatant attack

35:42.509 --> 35:43.644
on your intelligence,

35:43.677 --> 35:46.479
Mr. Shore buttons
his eloquent closing

35:46.513 --> 35:48.682
by appealing to your sense
of justice.

35:48.715 --> 35:52.052
This lawyer deliberately fell
on the body

35:52.085 --> 35:53.854
to contaminate evidence.

35:53.887 --> 35:55.088
The mother of the defendant

35:55.121 --> 35:56.523
tried to buy a witness.

35:56.557 --> 35:58.358
They staged
a performance by mom

35:58.391 --> 35:59.459
to make you think

35:59.492 --> 36:01.067
that she killed the victim
out of jealousy.

36:01.101 --> 36:02.636
Now, this would be funny

36:02.669 --> 36:04.571
if it weren't a murder trial.

36:05.371 --> 36:06.640
But it is.

36:08.041 --> 36:09.342
That man picked up a hammer

36:09.375 --> 36:10.877
and bludgeoned a woman to death.

36:10.911 --> 36:12.178
He's asking you to ignore that

36:12.212 --> 36:13.914
because of Sacco and Vanzetti.

36:13.947 --> 36:15.849
The police didn't explore
any other suspects,

36:15.882 --> 36:17.718
ladies and gentlemen,
because there are

36:17.751 --> 36:19.219
no other suspects.

36:19.252 --> 36:21.121
Paul Stewart is the man

36:21.154 --> 36:23.489
who killed Brenda Wilbur,

36:23.524 --> 36:25.926
which is why he dashed off
to his priest

36:27.027 --> 36:28.328
to confess.

36:30.731 --> 36:33.667
(music playing)

36:54.187 --> 36:56.156
At some point,
will they send us home?

36:56.189 --> 36:57.524
9:00.

37:00.266 --> 37:02.802
He was really compelling,

37:02.836 --> 37:04.103
the DA.

37:04.871 --> 37:06.640
How many times
are you gonna say that?

37:06.673 --> 37:09.308
Well, I said you were good too.

37:14.013 --> 37:16.182
If the news is bad,

37:16.215 --> 37:18.051
do I go into custody
right away?

37:18.084 --> 37:19.485
The news isn't gonna be bad.

37:22.723 --> 37:23.524
We're winning.

37:23.557 --> 37:26.492
(music playing)

37:43.877 --> 37:46.813
(indistinct chatter)

38:09.776 --> 38:11.812
Don't they make eye contact
when it's an acquittal?

38:11.845 --> 38:13.446
No.
Yes.

38:19.352 --> 38:21.755
MARCUS: I'm going to call
on the Foreperson

38:21.788 --> 38:23.690
to read the verdict.

38:23.724 --> 38:25.526
And I want decorum

38:25.559 --> 38:27.160
maintained by everyone,

38:27.961 --> 38:29.930
especially the media.

38:32.065 --> 38:33.567
Madam Foreperson,

38:33.600 --> 38:35.168
do you have a verdict?

38:36.236 --> 38:37.871
Yes, Your Honor.

38:37.904 --> 38:39.540
Mr. Stewart,

38:39.573 --> 38:41.474
you may stand up
for the reading.

38:44.778 --> 38:46.312
Would you please...

38:46.346 --> 38:47.714
announce your verdict?

38:50.651 --> 38:52.385
FOREPERSON: On the matter
of the Commonwealth

38:52.418 --> 38:54.387
vs. Paul Stewart,

38:54.420 --> 38:56.690
on the charge of murder
in the first degree,

38:58.391 --> 39:00.734
we, the jury,
find the defendant,

39:00.767 --> 39:02.869
Paul Stewart,

39:02.903 --> 39:04.705
not guilty.

39:04.738 --> 39:07.674
(indistinct chatter)

39:10.544 --> 39:12.145
MARCUS: The jury is dismissed.

39:12.178 --> 39:13.947
(gavel bangs)
MARCUS: We're adjourned.

39:15.115 --> 39:17.050
(applause)

39:19.452 --> 39:20.120
MAN: Mr. Shore.

39:20.153 --> 39:23.123
(indistinct chatter)

39:25.892 --> 39:26.893
Thank you.

39:32.833 --> 39:34.134
TARA: Paul, Congratulations.

39:34.167 --> 39:35.536
Boo.

39:36.603 --> 39:38.038
Boo.

39:49.850 --> 39:50.817
I don't know what to say.

39:50.851 --> 39:52.519
You owe me a lot of beer.

40:15.949 --> 40:18.251
I just have
two questions for you.

40:18.852 --> 40:19.886
Okay.

40:21.555 --> 40:22.823
Who do you think
killed her, really?

40:22.856 --> 40:25.058
How in God's name
would I know?

40:26.026 --> 40:27.360
It wasn't me.

40:28.562 --> 40:30.697
Did you really love my mother?

40:32.065 --> 40:33.567
I did.

40:33.600 --> 40:36.537
That stuff about her
being romantically in love

40:36.570 --> 40:37.838
with me, is any of that...

40:37.871 --> 40:40.140
Trial strategy.

40:49.550 --> 40:50.584
Thank you.

40:53.453 --> 40:54.755
Thank you.

40:56.456 --> 40:58.091
I got a great idea.

40:59.225 --> 41:01.334
When's the last time
you smoked pot?

41:01.367 --> 41:02.703
Wow.

41:03.436 --> 41:05.238
Depending on the...

41:05.271 --> 41:08.108
integrity of the container.
What are you doing?

41:08.141 --> 41:10.544
Our secret panel
in the tree trunk.

41:13.947 --> 41:16.650
I put some good Columbian
down there years ago.

41:22.022 --> 41:23.189
It's nailed.

41:24.424 --> 41:26.226
When did it get nailed?

41:26.259 --> 41:28.829
I don't know.
It looks like an old nail.

41:28.862 --> 41:31.798
How can you see
in this light whether--

41:46.880 --> 41:49.249
Paul, if I were to shine
a light down the tree trunk,

41:49.282 --> 41:50.717
what might I see?

41:56.089 --> 41:57.624
I don't want to look down
the tree trunk,

41:57.658 --> 41:58.792
do I, Paul?

42:00.466 --> 42:02.803
No, you don't.

42:08.675 --> 42:10.511
I really loved her, you know?

42:12.846 --> 42:14.548
And she didn't.

42:18.118 --> 42:20.220
(sighs)

42:22.088 --> 42:23.690
I really loved her.

42:25.158 --> 42:28.094
(music playing)

42:54.688 --> 42:57.624
(music playing)

43:18.785 --> 43:20.120
BOY: Score! Score! Score!
WOMAN: You stinker!

43:20.153 --> 43:22.288
BOY: Oh. (groans)

43:22.322 --> 43:25.158
(music playing)
