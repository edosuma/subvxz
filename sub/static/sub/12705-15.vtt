00:01.169 --> 00:03.137
Previously
 on Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:03.170 --> 00:05.139
I've recommended to the council,
and they've agreed

00:05.173 --> 00:06.974
that you be relieved
of your duties

00:07.006 --> 00:08.842
as watcher
immediately.

00:08.875 --> 00:10.843
You're fired.
Hello.

00:10.878 --> 00:12.080
New watcher?
New watcher.

00:12.112 --> 00:13.814
Wesley Wyndam-Pryce.

00:13.846 --> 00:15.048
Hey, slaying's
what we were built for.

00:15.083 --> 00:16.317
If you're not enjoying it,

00:16.350 --> 00:17.550
you're doing something wrong.

00:17.585 --> 00:19.420
Want.
(grunts)

00:19.452 --> 00:21.254
Take. Have.

00:21.289 --> 00:23.490
I'm gettin' it.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.492
(grunting)

00:25.525 --> 00:28.027
*

00:30.698 --> 00:33.634
(grunting)

00:37.871 --> 00:38.472
(grunts)

00:39.539 --> 00:40.073
Faith, no!

00:40.107 --> 00:41.975
(grunts)

00:47.215 --> 00:48.682
I didn't... I-I didn't know.

00:48.716 --> 00:49.950
I didn't know.

00:49.982 --> 00:51.351
BUFFY:
 They're gonna find

00:51.384 --> 00:53.286
a body.
There is no body.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.523
I took it, weighted it,
and dumped it.

00:55.555 --> 00:57.191
Faith, you don't get it.

00:57.225 --> 00:58.625
You killed a man.

00:58.658 --> 01:00.293
No, you don't get it.

01:01.329 --> 01:02.896
I don't care.

01:07.301 --> 01:09.736
*

01:40.634 --> 01:42.536
(panting)

01:44.103 --> 01:46.507
(gasps)

02:01.120 --> 02:03.490
(news anchor
speaking indistinctly)

02:03.524 --> 02:06.926
We go now live to our field
reporter, who is standing by

02:06.959 --> 02:08.929
at the waterfront
with this breaking news

02:08.961 --> 02:11.131
about the murder
that has shocked the mayor

02:11.164 --> 02:13.600
and residents of Sunnydale.

02:13.634 --> 02:16.770
REPORTER:
Fishermen discovered
the body today,

02:16.804 --> 02:18.771
the victim of a brutal stabbing.

02:18.806 --> 02:21.542
Authorities and citizens
alike were shocked

02:21.574 --> 02:23.043
when the slain man
was identified

02:23.075 --> 02:25.445
as Deputy Mayor Allan Finch.

02:25.478 --> 02:27.014
Still reeling from the news,

02:27.046 --> 02:29.015
Mayor Wilkins had this to say.

02:29.049 --> 02:32.219
WILKINS:
Mr. Finch was not only
my longtime aide

02:32.252 --> 02:34.054
and associate,

02:34.086 --> 02:37.057
he was a close personal friend.

02:37.090 --> 02:39.058
I promise you I will not rest

02:39.091 --> 02:42.295
until whoever did this is found
and brought to justice.

02:42.329 --> 02:44.131
Thank you very much.

02:44.163 --> 02:45.865
Oh, honey, you're up.

02:45.899 --> 02:48.668
Oh, it's just terrible,
isn't it?

02:55.074 --> 02:58.177
(wolf howling)

02:58.211 --> 03:00.281
*

03:48.329 --> 03:50.563
I want you to look into this.

03:50.598 --> 03:52.733
Find out everything you can
about the murder

03:52.765 --> 03:55.134
of the deputy
mayor.

03:55.168 --> 03:57.103
But that's... I-I mean,

03:57.137 --> 03:59.105
that's-that's not really
our jurisdiction.

03:59.139 --> 04:01.974
Is it?
FAITH:
It's no big, B.

04:02.008 --> 04:03.411
We'll get into it if he wants.

04:03.443 --> 04:05.278
GILES:
No, Buffy's right.

04:05.312 --> 04:08.215
The deputy mayor's murder
was the result of human malice.

04:08.247 --> 04:10.450
Nothing supernatural about it.

04:10.484 --> 04:12.218
We don't know that for certain.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.121
I say it merits investigation.

04:14.153 --> 04:15.656
Which I'm sure
the police are doing.

04:15.688 --> 04:17.725
Meantime, if you ask me,

04:17.757 --> 04:19.726
there are better uses
for the slayers' time.

04:19.759 --> 04:22.062
Ah. But I don't
believe I did...

04:22.095 --> 04:23.630
ask you.

04:23.663 --> 04:27.401
Considering the success
of your previous adventure...

04:27.435 --> 04:30.170
Don't let me
interrupt.

04:30.202 --> 04:32.572
Wait, let me interrupt.
I'm in a hurry.

04:32.605 --> 04:33.841
What did you need?

04:33.874 --> 04:35.608
Uh, psych class.
Freud and Jung.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.478
Book me.

04:37.511 --> 04:39.346
Happily.

04:40.613 --> 04:43.149
Check out Giles:
The Next Generation.

04:43.182 --> 04:45.319
What's your deal?

04:45.353 --> 04:46.987
Uh, I, uh...

04:47.019 --> 04:49.856
Well...

04:49.889 --> 04:52.259
I'm a...
New watcher.
Oh.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.528
Does everybody know
about you?

04:54.562 --> 04:56.497
She's a friend.

04:56.529 --> 04:58.499
Let's not exaggerate.

04:58.531 --> 05:02.836
So... you're the new watcher.

05:02.870 --> 05:05.271
Wesley Wyndam-Pryce.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.675
I like a man with
two last names.

05:07.708 --> 05:09.509
I'm Cordelia.

05:09.543 --> 05:10.944
And you teach psychology.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.512
I take psychology.

05:12.545 --> 05:13.781
She's a student.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.983
Oh, well. I, uh... Yes.

05:16.016 --> 05:18.050
In fact, I am...

05:18.084 --> 05:20.387
here to watch... girls.

05:20.420 --> 05:23.391
Uh, uh, Buffy and Faith,
to be specific.

05:23.423 --> 05:27.795
Well, it's about time we got
some fresh blood around here.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.028
(chuckles nervously)

05:29.062 --> 05:31.632
Well... fresh.

05:31.665 --> 05:34.701
Yes.

05:34.735 --> 05:36.470
Here we go.

05:36.504 --> 05:37.870
Thanks.

05:37.904 --> 05:40.740
So, welcome to Sunnydale.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.314
My.

05:47.346 --> 05:49.716
She's... cheeky, isn't she?

05:49.750 --> 05:53.887
Uh, first word "jail,"
second word "bait."

05:53.920 --> 05:55.656
(clears throat)

05:55.689 --> 05:57.324
Well, uh...

05:57.356 --> 05:58.658
where were we?

05:58.692 --> 06:00.326
Done.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.829
I mean, we were done, right?

06:02.862 --> 06:05.432
Uh, yep. Off to patrol.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.100
So we'll see ya.

06:07.134 --> 06:08.536
One moment, girls.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.170
I'm your commander now,

06:10.202 --> 06:11.672
and on the matter
of this murder,

06:11.704 --> 06:13.072
I am resolved.

06:13.105 --> 06:15.108
Natural
or super,

06:15.141 --> 06:16.910
I want to know.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.512
Fine by me.

06:18.545 --> 06:21.981
Always ready to kick
a little bad guy butt.

06:33.393 --> 06:36.196
So, you gonna rat me out?
Is that it?

06:36.228 --> 06:37.531
Faith, we have to tell.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.066
I can't pretend
to investigate this.

06:39.098 --> 06:40.768
I can't pretend
that I don't know.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.970
Oh, I see. But you can pretend
that Angel's still dead

06:43.002 --> 06:44.303
when you need to protect him.

06:44.336 --> 06:46.639
I am trying to protect you.

06:46.673 --> 06:48.408
Look, if-if we don't do
the right thing,

06:48.442 --> 06:49.909
it's only gonna make things
worse for you.

06:49.942 --> 06:52.144
Worse than jail
for the rest of my young life?

06:52.178 --> 06:53.880
No way.
Faith,

06:53.913 --> 06:55.816
what we did was...
Yeah. "We."

06:55.848 --> 06:58.552
You were right there beside me
when this whole thing went down.

06:58.586 --> 07:01.288
Anything I have to
answer for, you do, too.

07:01.321 --> 07:04.156
You're a part of this, B.
All the way.

07:15.201 --> 07:17.605
(indistinct chatter)

07:30.182 --> 07:31.418
Hey.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.420
Hey.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.923
Where's Faith?

07:35.956 --> 07:37.591
I saw her around.

07:37.625 --> 07:42.161
Figured you two were gonna go
kill some more nasty stuff.

07:42.194 --> 07:43.831
Not right now.

07:43.863 --> 07:46.634
I-I, um... I
think she bailed.

07:46.667 --> 07:49.036
Will, I was w...
Actually, I'm...

07:49.069 --> 07:51.038
(chuckles)

07:51.071 --> 07:54.106
Um, you go ahead.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.108
I'm late.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.278
I-I'm meeting Michael.

07:58.310 --> 07:59.779
The warlock guy.

07:59.812 --> 08:03.115
We're still trying
to de-rat Amy.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.317
Okay.

08:07.319 --> 08:09.656
So, see ya.

08:11.490 --> 08:14.060
See ya.

08:14.093 --> 08:16.896
(indistinct police transmission)

08:16.930 --> 08:19.899
(indistinct chatter)

08:19.932 --> 08:22.168
So, uh,

08:22.201 --> 08:24.170
you heard the man scream
about what time last night?

08:24.204 --> 08:27.173
Oh, I'm not sure.
7:00, maybe 8:00.

08:27.206 --> 08:30.410
Can you be more specific,
say between 7:30 and 8:00?

08:30.442 --> 08:32.846
(indistinct chatter)

08:36.583 --> 08:39.019
(siren wailing in distance)

08:47.360 --> 08:48.394
Your hand.

08:48.427 --> 08:50.563
Oh. It's okay.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.671
(crickets chirping)

08:57.705 --> 09:00.106
(whirring)

09:02.542 --> 09:04.076
It's not working.

09:04.110 --> 09:06.580
It's supposed to do something
besides shred?

09:06.614 --> 09:08.414
It's supposed
to cheer me up.

09:08.447 --> 09:11.418
Usually, using the shredder
gives me a lift. It's fun.

09:11.451 --> 09:13.854
And today you're
not getting the ya-yas.

09:13.886 --> 09:16.255
No.
(whirring)

09:16.288 --> 09:20.594
Guess it'll take more than this
to turn my frown upside down.

09:20.628 --> 09:23.029
I just don't understand
why Allan would leave

09:23.062 --> 09:25.532
such a paper trail
about our dealings.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.368
Do you think
he was gonna betray me?

09:28.400 --> 09:30.770
Oh, now,
that's a horrible thought.

09:30.803 --> 09:34.274
And now he's dead, I'll never
have the chance to scold him.

09:34.307 --> 09:35.775
Maybe this will change
your mood.

09:37.845 --> 09:39.245
What is it?

09:39.278 --> 09:41.213
Bombshell.

09:41.248 --> 09:44.618
The deputy mayor had
wooden splinters in his wound.

09:44.652 --> 09:48.054
Struck right through the heart
with a sharp, pointed object.

09:48.087 --> 09:51.290
Now, word is,
someone was fighting vampires

09:51.323 --> 09:53.661
not a block away
from the scene.

09:53.693 --> 09:57.264
Any smart money says it was
a slayer who did this job.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.499
What, do you think he talked?
To them?

09:59.532 --> 10:02.836
If he did, I'm thinking
he said the wrong thing.

10:03.870 --> 10:06.840
Well, this is exciting.

10:06.874 --> 10:10.442
A slayer up for murder one.

10:10.476 --> 10:13.446
That's sunshine and roses to me.
It really is.

10:13.480 --> 10:15.849
(laughing)

10:24.557 --> 10:26.894
(door opens)

10:36.369 --> 10:39.005
I'm telling you, we
did the world a favor.

10:39.038 --> 10:40.606
This guy was about
as interesting

10:40.639 --> 10:42.009
as watching paint dry.

10:42.042 --> 10:43.342
Faith.

10:43.375 --> 10:44.677
I'm joking.

10:44.711 --> 10:47.647
Geez, lighten up a little, B.

10:59.426 --> 11:02.995
He came out of nowhere.

11:03.029 --> 11:05.498
I know.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.567
Whatever.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.503
I'm not lookin' to hug and cry
and learn and grow.

11:10.537 --> 11:13.505
I'm just saying
it happened quick, you know?

11:15.375 --> 11:17.977
You know what?
Let's just blow.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.479
Who cares what this
guy was about?

11:19.511 --> 11:21.715
It's kind of moot now,
don't you think?

11:21.749 --> 11:23.984
I don't think he was
in that alley by chance.

11:24.017 --> 11:27.354
I think he was looking for us.
I'd like to know why.

11:27.386 --> 11:29.688
So, what, you think
there's some big conspiracy?

11:31.091 --> 11:33.360
You were saying?

11:33.393 --> 11:35.595
So his papers are gone.

11:35.628 --> 11:37.998
That doesn't prove anything.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.067
Except that somebody didn't
want us to prove anything.

11:51.543 --> 11:53.379
(door shuts)

11:53.413 --> 11:56.383
WILKINS: Get as many men on it
as you can.
Yeah.

11:56.415 --> 11:59.619
We'll be wanting
to turn up the heat.

12:10.230 --> 12:13.600
So, the mayor of Sunnydale
is a black hat.

12:13.633 --> 12:15.534
That's a shocker, huh?

12:15.567 --> 12:17.437
Actually, yeah.

12:17.470 --> 12:19.773
I didn't get
the bad guy vibe off of him.

12:19.807 --> 12:21.707
When are you
gonna learn, B?

12:21.740 --> 12:24.043
It doesn't matter what kind
of vibe you get off a person.

12:24.076 --> 12:26.278
'Cause nine times out of ten,
the face they're showing you

12:26.312 --> 12:28.280
is not the real one.

12:28.315 --> 12:31.283
I guess you know
a lot about that.

12:31.317 --> 12:34.822
What is that supposed to mean?

12:34.855 --> 12:36.623
It's just... Look at you, Faith.

12:36.655 --> 12:39.091
Less than 24 hours ago,
you killed a man.

12:39.125 --> 12:41.628
And now
it's all zip-a-dee-doo-dah?

12:41.661 --> 12:44.431
It's not your real face,
and I know it. Look, I know

12:44.463 --> 12:46.499
what you're feeling,
because I'm feeling it, too.

12:46.533 --> 12:49.802
Do you? So fill me in,
'cause I'd like to hear this.

12:49.836 --> 12:53.405
Dirty. Like something sick
creeped inside you

12:53.440 --> 12:55.642
and you can't get it out.
And you keep hoping

12:55.674 --> 12:57.644
that it was just some nightmare,
but it wasn't.

12:57.677 --> 12:59.412
And we are gonna have
to figure out...

12:59.446 --> 13:02.514
Is there gonna be
an intermission in this?

13:02.548 --> 13:06.119
Just let me talk to Giles, okay?
I swear...
No.

13:06.153 --> 13:08.687
We're not bringing anybody else
into this.

13:08.721 --> 13:10.523
You got to keep your head, B.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.359
This is all gonna blow over
in a few days.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.594
And if it doesn't?
If it doesn't,

13:14.626 --> 13:16.996
they got a freighter leaving
the docks at least twice a day.

13:17.029 --> 13:18.498
It ain't fancy
but it gets you gone.

13:18.530 --> 13:20.933
And that's it?
You just live with it?

13:20.967 --> 13:22.668
You see the dead guy
in your head every day

13:22.701 --> 13:24.370
for the rest of your life?

13:24.403 --> 13:27.807
Buffy,
I'm not gonna see anything.

13:27.841 --> 13:30.643
I missed the mark last night
and I'm sorry about the guy--

13:30.677 --> 13:33.880
I really am-- but it happens.

13:33.913 --> 13:36.884
Anyways, how many people
do you think we've saved by now,

13:36.917 --> 13:39.485
thousands? And didn't you stop
the world from ending?

13:39.519 --> 13:40.888
Because
in my book,

13:40.921 --> 13:43.289
that puts you and me
in the plus column.

13:43.322 --> 13:46.459
We help people. It doesn't mean
we can do whatever we want.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.695
Why not?
The guy I offed was no Gandhi.

13:48.727 --> 13:51.063
I mean, we just saw-- he was
mixed up in dirty dealings.

13:51.097 --> 13:53.365
Maybe. But what if he was coming
to us for help?

13:53.399 --> 13:54.868
What if he was?

13:54.902 --> 13:56.870
You're still not seeing
the big picture, B.

13:56.903 --> 13:58.538
Something made us different.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.139
We're warriors.
We're built to kill.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.841
To kill demons.

14:01.875 --> 14:04.510
But it does not mean that we get
to pass judgment on people

14:04.543 --> 14:05.879
like we're better
than everybody else.

14:05.913 --> 14:07.279
We are better.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.219
That's right. Better.

14:12.251 --> 14:14.553
People need us to survive.

14:14.586 --> 14:18.057
In the balance, nobody's gonna
cry over some random bystander

14:18.091 --> 14:19.326
who got caught in the crossfire.

14:19.359 --> 14:22.761
I am.

14:23.796 --> 14:25.865
Well, that's your loss.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.113
Buffy.

14:43.615 --> 14:45.451
MAN:
 Tell me again.

14:45.485 --> 14:48.620
You got home at what
time last night?
Late.

14:48.654 --> 14:50.957
Um, a-a little past 1:00,
I guess.

14:50.990 --> 14:53.559
Maybe you can explain to me
what a girl your age

14:53.592 --> 14:55.062
is doing out all night.

14:55.095 --> 14:56.796
Just hanging.

14:56.828 --> 14:58.398
Hanging.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.600
By yourself?

15:00.633 --> 15:03.070
No. I was with my friend Buffy.

15:03.102 --> 15:06.206
We were at Faith's watching TV.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.941
What did
you watch?

15:07.975 --> 15:10.943
Some old movie.

15:10.977 --> 15:12.544
Infomercial.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.780
(chuckles)
That's funny,

15:14.813 --> 15:16.783
'cause I got a couple
of witnesses

15:16.816 --> 15:18.418
who put you near the alley.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.787
Witnesses?

15:24.456 --> 15:27.995
Somebody stabbed this guy
through the heart.

15:28.028 --> 15:30.629
Strange thing
is, the weapon,

15:30.663 --> 15:35.134
it was made out of wood.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.403
Any of this mean
anything to you?

15:37.437 --> 15:41.975
Yeah. That whoever did it
wasn't hip to the Bronze Age.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.246
Is that it? I'm kind of beat.

15:47.279 --> 15:50.649
Yeah, I have enough for now.

15:50.682 --> 15:54.086
Buffy, if you know something,

15:54.120 --> 15:56.255
if you're protecting someone,

15:56.288 --> 15:58.258
I promise you,

15:58.290 --> 16:00.927
it'll be better for everyone
if you just come clean.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.928
You mean
am I covering for someone?

16:02.961 --> 16:06.033
Hardly. I'm not the "throw
myself on the sword" type.

16:06.066 --> 16:08.201
I wish I could help you.
(sighs)

16:08.235 --> 16:10.802
Well,

16:10.836 --> 16:13.972
call me
if you remember anything.

16:16.208 --> 16:17.844
(horn honking in distance)

16:17.876 --> 16:20.246
(keys jangle)

16:26.253 --> 16:28.687
(engine starts)

16:37.496 --> 16:39.865
(beeping)

16:41.500 --> 16:43.903
(tapping)

16:49.709 --> 16:51.744
Hey.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.580
Hey.

16:53.613 --> 16:56.749
I need to talk to you.

16:56.783 --> 16:59.652
Good. 'Cause...

16:59.686 --> 17:01.921
I've been letting
things fester.

17:01.953 --> 17:04.691
And I don't like it.

17:04.723 --> 17:07.394
I want to be fester-free.

17:07.425 --> 17:11.097
Yeah. Me, too.

17:11.131 --> 17:13.098
I mean, don't get me wrong.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.268
I-I completely understand

17:15.300 --> 17:17.868
why you and Faith have been
doing the bonding thing.

17:17.903 --> 17:19.372
You guys work together.

17:19.405 --> 17:21.173
You-you should get along.

17:21.208 --> 17:24.844
It's more complicated than that.
But, see,

17:24.876 --> 17:27.680
it's that exact thing
that-that's just ticking me off.

17:27.713 --> 17:30.517
It's this whole
"slayers only" attitude.

17:30.549 --> 17:33.619
I mean, since when
wouldn't I understand?

17:33.653 --> 17:37.223
Y-You talk to me
about everything.

17:37.257 --> 17:39.558
It's like all of a sudden

17:39.592 --> 17:41.560
I'm not cool enough for you

17:41.594 --> 17:44.063
because I can't kill things
with my bare hands.

17:44.096 --> 17:46.798
(crying)
Oh.

17:46.833 --> 17:49.801
Oh, Buffy. Don't cry.

17:49.836 --> 17:54.240
I-I'm sorry. Oh,
I-I was too hard on you.

17:54.273 --> 17:55.875
Uh, sometimes I-I unleash.

17:55.907 --> 17:57.277
I-I don't know my own strength.

17:57.309 --> 18:01.047
I-It's bad. I-I'm bad.

18:01.079 --> 18:04.049
I'm a bad, bad, bad person.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.118
Will, I'm in trouble.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.589
And Faith acts like
she doesn't even care.

18:10.623 --> 18:13.826
And the way she talks, it's like
she didn't even make a mistake.

18:13.859 --> 18:17.896
Do you think
she's, like, i-in shock?

18:17.930 --> 18:20.232
(sighs)
I don't know.

18:20.267 --> 18:23.236
And I think that detective knows
more than he's saying.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.505
I think he knew
that I was lying.

18:25.538 --> 18:28.340
You have to go to Giles, Buffy.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.676
He'll know what to do.

18:46.692 --> 18:49.127
Giles?

18:53.566 --> 18:56.001
Buffy.

18:57.002 --> 18:58.871
Uh,

18:58.904 --> 19:02.541
I don't really know
how to say this,

19:02.575 --> 19:06.212
so, um,
I'm-I'm just gonna say it.

19:06.246 --> 19:09.382
(sighs)
I know I've kept things from you

19:09.415 --> 19:12.151
before,
but...

19:16.189 --> 19:18.490
But, um...

19:18.525 --> 19:21.894
but I-I've been blowing off
my classes.

19:21.928 --> 19:24.663
You know? In-in the sense
of not attending.

19:24.696 --> 19:27.299
And, uh...
FAITH:
It's okay, Buffy.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.201
I told him.

19:30.237 --> 19:31.837
You told him?

19:31.871 --> 19:34.840
I had to.

19:34.874 --> 19:37.977
He had to know what you did.

19:38.009 --> 19:39.246
What I d...

19:42.515 --> 19:45.852
Giles, no. Th-That's
just not what happened.

19:45.884 --> 19:47.819
I don't want to hear it, Buffy.
No...

19:47.854 --> 19:49.521
I don't want
to hear any more lies.

19:49.556 --> 19:50.589
You can't be serious.
You're setting me up?

19:50.623 --> 19:52.157
Get
in my office now.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.826
Faith, I'll talk to you
in the morning.

19:53.859 --> 19:54.861
Giles, please, you have to...

19:54.894 --> 19:56.462
Now.

20:04.202 --> 20:06.272
Um...

20:06.306 --> 20:08.740
sorry.

20:18.217 --> 20:21.019
Giles, I didn't do this.
I swear.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.954
Look, I know
that I messed up badly,

20:22.989 --> 20:26.125
but the murder,
i-it was...
It was Faith. I know.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.596
She may have many talents,
Buffy,

20:30.630 --> 20:32.765
but, fortunately,
lying is not one of them.

20:33.766 --> 20:36.167
Oh.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.640
Oh, God.

20:42.642 --> 20:45.076
I-I thought...
I'm sorry.

20:45.111 --> 20:47.078
Uh,

20:47.113 --> 20:49.415
I needed her to think
that I was on her side.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.351
I don't know how far
she'll take this charade.

20:52.419 --> 20:55.121
Try far.

20:55.153 --> 20:57.088
Like all the way.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.794
You should have come to me
right off.

21:01.827 --> 21:03.596
I know.

21:03.630 --> 21:06.333
Well, I-I wanted to.
But Faith

21:06.365 --> 21:09.769
wouldn't hear of it?
It's not all her
fault, Giles.

21:09.801 --> 21:11.103
We both thought
it was a vampire.

21:11.136 --> 21:12.571
I-I only realized it
a second before.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.140
Buffy,
this is not the first time

21:14.173 --> 21:15.474
something like this
has happened.

21:15.508 --> 21:17.242
It's not?

21:17.276 --> 21:20.980
The slayer is on the front line
of a nightly war.

21:21.012 --> 21:24.049
It's-it's tragic,
but accidents have happened.

21:25.284 --> 21:28.019
What do you do?

21:28.054 --> 21:30.021
Well, the council investigates,

21:30.056 --> 21:32.692
um, metes out punishment
if punishment is due.

21:32.724 --> 21:35.961
But... I have no plan
to involve them.

21:35.994 --> 21:39.131
I mean, it's the last thing
Faith needs at the moment.

21:39.164 --> 21:41.133
She's unstable, Buffy.

21:41.166 --> 21:45.003
I mean, she's utterly unable
to accept responsibility.

21:45.037 --> 21:48.007
She's freaking.

21:48.039 --> 21:51.377
So... so then we-we just have
to help her deal, right?

21:51.411 --> 21:53.380
She's in denial.
There is no help for her

21:53.413 --> 21:55.448
until she admits what happened.

21:55.481 --> 21:57.517
I-I could talk to her.

21:57.549 --> 22:00.819
Perhaps.

22:00.853 --> 22:03.055
Or maybe I'm too close.

22:03.088 --> 22:06.125
Maybe, maybe one
of the guys could.

22:06.157 --> 22:08.126
We should meet.

22:08.160 --> 22:12.230
It-it may be that they're seeing
a different side of her.

22:12.263 --> 22:15.233
Okay.

22:15.267 --> 22:18.237
In the meantime,

22:18.269 --> 22:20.673
no one else
is to know.

22:20.707 --> 22:22.509
Understood?

22:22.541 --> 22:24.510
BUFFY:
Of course.

22:24.544 --> 22:28.515
GILES:
This is...
extremely delicate.

22:28.548 --> 22:30.517
If we scare
her off now,

22:30.549 --> 22:33.219
we may lose
her forever.

22:49.367 --> 22:53.338
Yes, hello. Mr. Travers, please.
Quentin Travers.

22:53.372 --> 22:56.342
Wesley Wyndam-Pryce calling.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.176
The code word?

22:58.210 --> 23:00.512
Uh, uh, monkey.

23:00.547 --> 23:03.182
M-O-N-K...

23:03.214 --> 23:06.586
Just put him on, will you?
This is an emergency.

23:06.618 --> 23:10.221
WILLOW: Well, maybe we should
 all talk to Faith together.

23:10.256 --> 23:13.559
You mean, like that intervention
thing you guys did on me?

23:13.593 --> 23:16.895
As I recall, Xander and I
nearly came to blows.

23:16.929 --> 23:19.298
Uh, you nearly came
to blows, Buffy.

23:19.330 --> 23:21.299
I nearly came
to loss of limbs.

23:21.333 --> 23:23.068
No, Faith is
too defensive

23:23.102 --> 23:25.971
for a confrontation
like that.

23:26.005 --> 23:28.941
She'll respond better to
a one-on-one approach.

23:28.974 --> 23:31.743
I can be the one. On her one.

23:33.112 --> 23:34.980
Let's rephrase.

23:35.013 --> 23:37.249
I think she might
listen to me.

23:37.282 --> 23:40.152
We kind of have,
um, a connection.

23:40.185 --> 23:41.420
BUFFY:
A connection?

23:41.453 --> 23:43.490
Why would you
think that...

23:43.522 --> 23:46.092
I'm just saying it's worth
a shot. That's all.

23:46.125 --> 23:49.394
No, I-I don't see it, Xander.
I mean, of-of all of us,

23:49.427 --> 23:50.829
you're the one
person, arguably,

23:50.863 --> 23:52.664
that Faith has had
the least contact with.

23:52.699 --> 23:56.001
Yeah, but we hung out
a little... recently,

23:56.035 --> 23:59.270
and she seemed
to be, um, responsive.

23:59.305 --> 24:00.807
BUFFY:
When did you
guys hang out?

24:00.839 --> 24:02.575
XANDER:
She was fighting
one of those, uh,

24:02.608 --> 24:05.144
apocalypse demon things
and I helped her.

24:05.176 --> 24:07.078
Gave her a ride home.

24:07.113 --> 24:08.413
And you guys talked?

24:08.446 --> 24:11.817
Not extensively, no.
Then why

24:11.851 --> 24:13.586
would you...

24:13.619 --> 24:16.422
Oh.

24:16.454 --> 24:18.857
Oh!

24:20.392 --> 24:24.363
I don't need to say "oh."
I got it before.

24:24.395 --> 24:26.798
They slept together.

24:31.369 --> 24:33.338
Fine, fine.
Let's-let's move on.

24:33.372 --> 24:37.375
Uh, I... Look, I-I know that
you mean well, Xander, but, um,

24:37.409 --> 24:40.211
I-I just don't see
Faith opening up to you.

24:40.246 --> 24:43.048
She doesn't take the guys

24:43.082 --> 24:47.519
that she has a... connection
with very seriously.

24:47.554 --> 24:50.288
And they're-they're
kind of a big joke to her.

24:50.322 --> 24:51.857
No offense.

24:51.891 --> 24:54.192
(chuckles)
Oh, no.

24:54.226 --> 24:57.496
I mean, why would
I be offended by that?
However,

24:57.529 --> 24:59.999
if you-you still want
to be of assistance, I-I need

25:00.031 --> 25:02.669
some help with research.
There's still the business

25:02.701 --> 25:05.037
of the mayor and Mr. Trick
to attend to.

25:05.070 --> 25:08.339
Yeah, they-they seemed
pretty cozy the other night.
Yes.

25:08.374 --> 25:11.711
Uh, Willow, c-can you, um,
access the mayor's files?

25:11.743 --> 25:13.712
What?

25:13.746 --> 25:16.715
Oh, uh, sure. I can try.

25:16.749 --> 25:19.484
Good, yes, because,
clearly, he, uh...

25:19.518 --> 25:21.053
we need to take a
harder look at him.

25:21.086 --> 25:22.888
He's-he's, um...

25:22.922 --> 25:25.356
he's obviously
up to something.

25:25.391 --> 25:27.358
What about Faith?

25:29.528 --> 25:31.497
I don't know.

25:31.529 --> 25:33.566
I need time.

25:33.599 --> 25:35.467
She needs help now.

25:37.269 --> 25:39.705
I owe her that.

25:44.711 --> 25:49.515
(crying)
* Disappointment stops by

25:49.548 --> 25:54.119
* From time to time

25:54.153 --> 25:56.989
* To see how I'm doin'

25:58.557 --> 26:03.194
* And he came by last night

26:03.229 --> 26:07.767
* Right after you left

26:07.799 --> 26:10.568
* My life in ruin

26:14.573 --> 26:21.579
* When I don't get
what I want... *

26:21.614 --> 26:25.416
* The spoiled child inside

26:25.451 --> 26:28.420
(knocking)
* Breaks down

26:28.453 --> 26:30.789
(indistinct voices on TV)

26:35.193 --> 26:36.796
(horn honking in distance)

26:36.828 --> 26:39.464
What?

26:42.101 --> 26:44.170
I just, uh,

26:44.202 --> 26:47.105
came by to see how you are,
actually.
Oh?

26:47.138 --> 26:49.808
I'm sick of people asking me
that, for one thing.

26:52.679 --> 26:55.580
Can I come in?

26:55.614 --> 26:57.615
Just to talk. I promise.

26:57.650 --> 27:01.119
Like you could make something
happen if I didn't want it to?

27:01.153 --> 27:02.954
Hey, yeah. You got me there.

27:02.989 --> 27:04.856
Pretty much not gonna try to...

27:04.891 --> 27:06.925
take you
under any circumstances.

27:06.959 --> 27:09.161
See?

27:09.194 --> 27:11.931
Here, feel that.
Probably like a wet noodle

27:11.963 --> 27:13.164
to you, huh?
Five minutes.

27:13.199 --> 27:15.334
That's all I need.

27:15.366 --> 27:17.336
For talking. And conversation.

27:17.368 --> 27:19.337
I'm, um, quick as a bunny.

27:19.371 --> 27:21.373
Clock is running.

27:24.042 --> 27:26.444
It's just, uh...

27:26.478 --> 27:28.279
I heard
about what happened,

27:28.314 --> 27:30.281
and I thought
you might need a friend.

27:30.316 --> 27:33.519
So then go talk to Buffy.
She's the one who killed a guy.

27:33.551 --> 27:36.355
Yeah. I heard
that version.

27:36.387 --> 27:38.023
Version?

27:38.057 --> 27:41.460
Either way, it-it sounds
like it was an accident,

27:41.492 --> 27:42.828
and that's the important part.

27:42.862 --> 27:44.529
No, the important part

27:44.563 --> 27:48.134
is that Buffy is
the "accidental murderer."

27:48.166 --> 27:50.135
Faith,

27:50.169 --> 27:52.971
you may not think so,
but I sort of know you.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.472
And I've seen you post-battle.

27:54.506 --> 27:57.809
And I know firsthand
that you're, um,

27:57.844 --> 27:59.510
like a wild thing.

27:59.545 --> 28:01.748
And half the time, you
don't know what you're doing.

28:01.780 --> 28:05.084
And you're living proof of that,
aren't you?
See?

28:05.116 --> 28:07.685
You're trying to hurt me.

28:07.720 --> 28:10.521
But right now,
you need someone on your side.

28:10.556 --> 28:12.357
What happened wasn't your fault.

28:12.391 --> 28:14.593
And I'm willing
to testify to that in court

28:14.625 --> 28:16.662
if you need me.

28:16.694 --> 28:18.897
You'd dig that, wouldn't you?

28:18.931 --> 28:20.900
To get up in front
of all your geek pals

28:20.932 --> 28:24.403
and go on record about how I
made you my boy toy for a night.
No.

28:24.435 --> 28:26.005
No, no, no, no, no.
That's not it.

28:26.038 --> 28:28.074
I know what this
is all about.

28:28.106 --> 28:31.210
You just came by here
'cause you want another taste,

28:31.242 --> 28:32.611
don't you?
No.

28:32.644 --> 28:34.046
I mean, it was nice.

28:34.079 --> 28:36.214
It was great.
(scoffs)

28:36.248 --> 28:38.951
It was kind of a blur.

28:38.984 --> 28:41.086
But, okay,

28:41.119 --> 28:43.521
someday,
sure, yea.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.025
But not now.

28:46.057 --> 28:48.027
Not like this.

28:48.059 --> 28:49.929
More like how then?

28:49.961 --> 28:51.430
Lights on or off?

28:51.462 --> 28:53.598
Kinks or vanilla?

28:53.632 --> 28:55.101
Faith, come on.

28:55.134 --> 28:58.069
I came here to help you.

29:00.239 --> 29:04.042
I thought we had a connection.

29:04.076 --> 29:06.744
(laughs)

29:08.815 --> 29:11.116
You want to feel
a connection?

29:11.150 --> 29:13.618
It's just skin.

29:13.652 --> 29:17.455
I see, I want, I take.

29:19.490 --> 29:21.460
I forget.

29:21.492 --> 29:23.095
No.

29:23.128 --> 29:24.931
We...

29:24.963 --> 29:27.900
It was more than that.
I could do
anything to you

29:27.933 --> 29:30.568
right now, and you want me to.

29:30.602 --> 29:32.671
I could make you scream.

29:39.211 --> 29:40.612
(panting)

29:40.645 --> 29:42.981
I could make you die.

29:45.284 --> 29:48.019
(gasping)

30:07.205 --> 30:09.407
(thump)

30:23.422 --> 30:26.157
Finally decided
to tie me up, huh?

30:26.192 --> 30:29.327
I always knew you weren't
really a one-slayer guy.

30:29.361 --> 30:31.329
Sorry about the chains.

30:31.363 --> 30:34.000
It's not that
I don't trust you...

30:34.032 --> 30:36.167
Actually, it is
that I don't trust you.

30:36.201 --> 30:38.537
The thing with Xander--
I know what it looked like,

30:38.569 --> 30:40.372
but we were just playing.

30:40.405 --> 30:42.340
And he forgot the safety word.

30:42.374 --> 30:43.976
Is that it?

30:44.009 --> 30:46.278
Safety words
are for wusses.

30:48.013 --> 30:50.848
I bet you're not big on trust
games, now, are you, Faith?

30:50.883 --> 30:52.151
You gonna shrink me now?

30:52.183 --> 30:53.751
That it?
No.

30:53.785 --> 30:55.020
I just want to talk to you.

30:55.054 --> 30:56.521
That's what
they all say.

30:56.555 --> 30:59.590
And then it's just,
"Let me stay the night.

30:59.625 --> 31:01.559
Won't try anything."

31:01.593 --> 31:02.994
You want to go
the long way around?

31:03.028 --> 31:06.397
Hey, I can do that.

31:06.432 --> 31:09.434
I'm not getting any older.

31:24.316 --> 31:26.051
How's she doing?

31:26.085 --> 31:28.054
Well, it's like
talking to a wall.

31:28.086 --> 31:29.855
Only you get more from a wall.

31:29.887 --> 31:31.623
But you'll keep trying, right?

31:31.656 --> 31:33.424
Sure. We're just
getting started.

31:33.459 --> 31:35.727
So, what do I do?

31:35.760 --> 31:38.931
Look, right now, there's
nothing that you can do.

31:40.098 --> 31:42.067
Well, this could
take awhile, right?

31:42.101 --> 31:44.603
So, I'll just go to Faith's
and I'll get some of her stuff.

31:44.635 --> 31:46.438
And that way she'll see
that we're on her side.

31:46.471 --> 31:48.440
That's a good idea.

31:48.473 --> 31:49.575
Okay.

31:49.607 --> 31:52.044
I'll be back.
Look, I--

31:52.077 --> 31:54.913
I don't want you to get
your hopes up, Buffy, um,

31:54.947 --> 31:57.449
She may not want us to help her.

31:57.482 --> 31:58.916
She does.

31:58.951 --> 32:00.419
She just doesn't know
how to say it.

32:00.451 --> 32:01.586
'Cause she killed a man.

32:01.619 --> 32:02.887
That changes everything for her.

32:02.921 --> 32:05.391
Giles said with counseling,

32:05.423 --> 32:07.093
they might not even
need to lock her up.

32:07.125 --> 32:09.127
That's not what I mean.

32:10.362 --> 32:12.964
She's taken a life.

32:12.999 --> 32:15.433
I know.

32:15.467 --> 32:17.303
She's got a taste for it now.

32:22.273 --> 32:24.242
Not one slayer, but two.

32:24.276 --> 32:26.112
Right here in the building.

32:26.144 --> 32:27.980
There was supposed
to be a guard.

32:28.013 --> 32:29.347
Shh! Here comes
my favorite part.

32:29.381 --> 32:31.450
Where the slayers see us

32:31.482 --> 32:33.785
in the hall together,
thick as thieves.

32:33.818 --> 32:35.621
Oh, wait, we are thieves
and worse.

32:35.653 --> 32:37.423
And now they know it.

32:37.455 --> 32:40.259
Well, they're not gonna be
much of a threat in jail.

32:40.291 --> 32:42.927
Yeah, we don't have near enough
evidence to put them away.

32:42.961 --> 32:44.796
No.

32:44.829 --> 32:48.534
You're gonna have to come up
with a more efficient solution.

32:48.567 --> 32:51.836
And Mr. Trick,
you better think of it soon.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.714
I know what's going on with you.

33:03.749 --> 33:05.116
Join the club.

33:05.151 --> 33:07.153
Everybody seems
to have a theory.

33:07.185 --> 33:11.123
Hmm, but I know what it's like

33:11.156 --> 33:12.357
to take a life.

33:12.391 --> 33:13.659
To feel a future,

33:13.692 --> 33:16.362
a world of possibilities,

33:16.394 --> 33:19.198
snuffed out by your own hand.

33:19.230 --> 33:21.232
I know the power in it.

33:21.267 --> 33:23.801
The exhilaration.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.971
It was like a drug for me.

33:26.003 --> 33:27.673
Yeah? Sounds like
you need some help.

33:27.705 --> 33:29.740
A professional, maybe.

33:29.775 --> 33:33.278
Hmm, a professional
couldn't have helped me.

33:35.614 --> 33:37.648
It stopped when
I got my soul back.

33:37.682 --> 33:40.719
My human heart.

33:40.751 --> 33:42.520
Goody for you.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.823
If we're gonna party,
let's get on with it.

33:44.855 --> 33:47.058
Otherwise, could you let
me out of these things?

33:47.093 --> 33:48.359
Faith?

33:48.394 --> 33:51.396
You have a choice.

33:51.430 --> 33:55.201
I mean, you've tasted
something few ever do.

33:55.233 --> 33:59.171
I mean, to kill without remorse
is to feel like a god.

33:59.204 --> 34:02.074
Right now, all I feel is a cramp
in my wrist, so let me go!

34:02.107 --> 34:04.442
But you're not a god, no.

34:04.476 --> 34:06.545
You're not much more
than a child.

34:06.577 --> 34:10.449
Going down this path
will ruin you.

34:10.481 --> 34:14.253
You can't imagine the price
for true evil.

34:14.286 --> 34:16.387
Yeah?

34:16.422 --> 34:20.092
I hope evil takes MasterCard.

34:22.561 --> 34:26.030
You and me, Faith?

34:26.063 --> 34:28.599
We're a lot alike.

34:28.634 --> 34:32.036
Time was,
I thought humans existed

34:32.070 --> 34:34.072
just to hurt each other.

34:39.411 --> 34:42.313
But then I came here.

34:42.347 --> 34:45.583
And I found out that there
are other types of people.

34:45.617 --> 34:48.353
People who genuinely
wanted to do right.

34:52.590 --> 34:54.559
And they make mistakes.

34:54.592 --> 34:56.561
And they fall down.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.563
You know,
but they keep caring.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.998
Keep trying.

35:02.934 --> 35:06.637
If you can trust us, Faith,
this can all change.

35:06.672 --> 35:09.840
You don't have to disappear
into the darkness.

35:09.875 --> 35:11.210
(pounding on door)

35:17.516 --> 35:19.485
(grunting)

35:27.025 --> 35:27.858
What?

35:27.893 --> 35:29.527
By the order

35:29.561 --> 35:31.262
of the Watcher's
Council of Britain,

35:31.297 --> 35:33.532
I'm exercising
my authority

35:33.565 --> 35:35.201
and removing you
to England,

35:35.233 --> 35:36.702
where you will
accept the judgment

35:36.735 --> 35:38.737
of the Disciplinary
Committee.

35:54.085 --> 35:56.621
I'm sorry
for the extreme measures.

35:56.655 --> 35:59.791
Unfortunately, this is
a rather extreme circumstance.

35:59.824 --> 36:01.393
Whatever.

36:01.427 --> 36:04.730
Please believe nobody
is rushing to judgment.

36:04.762 --> 36:07.465
The first priority
of both myself and the Council

36:07.498 --> 36:10.135
is to help you.

36:10.168 --> 36:12.237
Ah, now, none of that.

36:12.271 --> 36:14.505
Tighten her restraints.

36:14.539 --> 36:16.875
Faith, there's no point
in fighting this.

36:16.907 --> 36:18.577
(grunting)

36:18.610 --> 36:19.710
Have to disagree
with you on that one.

36:19.744 --> 36:21.179
Now unlock these or I'll pop

36:21.213 --> 36:22.880
this guy's head like a grape.

36:22.914 --> 36:24.750
(groaning)

36:27.585 --> 36:29.221
Don't even think about it.

36:44.135 --> 36:47.938
Faith, you can't keep running.

36:50.876 --> 36:52.777
Wrong again, Wes.

36:55.713 --> 36:57.583
(grunts)

37:17.168 --> 37:18.536
It was the new watcher.

37:18.570 --> 37:20.639
He had a couple
of guys helping him.

37:20.672 --> 37:22.474
Then he figured it out?

37:22.507 --> 37:24.543
Which means
that Faith will be soon

37:24.576 --> 37:27.077
on her way back to England
to face the Watcher's Council.

37:27.112 --> 37:28.980
And then what?

37:29.014 --> 37:31.717
GILES:
Most likely they'll lock her
away for a good long while.

37:31.750 --> 37:34.119
So we head them off
at the airport and stop them.

37:34.152 --> 37:35.753
Can I--?

37:35.786 --> 37:37.956
I'm just wondering-- why?

37:39.425 --> 37:41.927
I'm not the most objective,
I know.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.628
I kind of have
an issue with Faith

37:43.661 --> 37:46.297
sharing my people.

37:46.331 --> 37:49.335
But she murdered someone
and accused Buffy.

37:49.367 --> 37:51.336
Then she hurt Xander.

37:51.369 --> 37:54.639
I hate to say it, but maybe
she belongs behind bars.

37:54.672 --> 37:57.509
BUFFY:
She's out of control, I know.

37:57.543 --> 37:59.510
But Angel was getting
somewhere with her.

37:59.545 --> 38:01.146
She was opening up.

38:01.179 --> 38:03.181
Look, if we could
just stop Wesley--

38:03.213 --> 38:05.083
That's no longer an issue.

38:05.115 --> 38:06.585
You let her get away?

38:06.617 --> 38:07.985
"Let" wouldn't be the way

38:08.018 --> 38:10.489
I'd phrase it
but, yes, she escaped.

38:10.521 --> 38:12.990
ANGEL:
That's good work.

38:13.023 --> 38:15.193
First, you terrorize her, then
you put her back in the streets.

38:15.226 --> 38:17.795
That was hardly my plan.

38:17.829 --> 38:19.130
I was trying to save her.

38:19.164 --> 38:20.465
But you didn't.

38:20.498 --> 38:22.501
You probably destroyed her.
Buffy?

38:22.534 --> 38:24.536
(quietly):
That's enough.

38:24.570 --> 38:26.137
I better find her

38:26.170 --> 38:27.938
before she does any more damage.

38:27.972 --> 38:29.206
We're gonna need to split up.

38:29.239 --> 38:30.376
I'll check the docks.

38:30.409 --> 38:31.943
That's probably where she is.

38:31.976 --> 38:34.112
Giles, why don't you go
to her motel? Xander,

38:34.144 --> 38:35.681
Willow, her haunts
and be careful.

38:35.713 --> 38:37.682
I'll try the airport.

38:39.016 --> 38:41.686
What can I do?

38:41.719 --> 38:43.688
I want to help.

38:43.722 --> 38:46.358
You still got your ticket
back to the mother country?

39:12.951 --> 39:15.621
You don't give up, do you?

39:16.855 --> 39:18.824
Not on my friends, no.

39:18.856 --> 39:19.925
Yeah.

39:19.958 --> 39:21.226
Because you and me are such

39:21.259 --> 39:23.094
solid buds, right?

39:23.128 --> 39:24.195
We could be.

39:24.228 --> 39:25.996
It's not too late.

39:26.030 --> 39:27.432
For me to change and be
more like you, you mean?

39:27.465 --> 39:30.168
Little Miss Goody
Two Shoes?

39:30.201 --> 39:32.603
It ain't gonna happen, B.

39:32.637 --> 39:35.072
Faith, nobody is
asking you to be like me,

39:35.106 --> 39:37.074
but you can't go on like this.

39:37.108 --> 39:40.244
Scares you, doesn't it?

39:40.277 --> 39:42.514
Yeah, it scares me.

39:42.547 --> 39:44.516
Faith, you're hurting people.
You're hurting yourself.

39:44.550 --> 39:45.916
But that's not it.

39:45.951 --> 39:47.518
That's not what
bothers you so much.

39:47.552 --> 39:49.286
What bugs you is
you know I'm right.

39:49.320 --> 39:50.856
You know in your gut
we don't need the law.

39:50.889 --> 39:51.922
We are the law.

39:51.956 --> 39:53.425
No.
Yes.

39:53.458 --> 39:54.793
You know exactly
what I'm about

39:54.826 --> 39:55.960
'cause you have it
in you, too.

39:55.994 --> 39:57.295
No, Faith, you're sick.

39:57.327 --> 39:58.797
I've seen it, B.
You've got the lust.

39:58.829 --> 40:00.465
And I'm not just talking
about screwing vampires.

40:00.498 --> 40:02.367
Don't you dare
bring him into this.

40:02.400 --> 40:03.702
It was good, wasn't it?

40:03.735 --> 40:05.036
The sex?

40:05.070 --> 40:06.972
The danger?
Bet a part of you

40:07.005 --> 40:08.440
even dug him
when he went psycho.

40:08.474 --> 40:10.375
No.

40:10.407 --> 40:12.043
See, you need me to toe the
line, 'cause you're afraid

40:12.077 --> 40:13.579
you'll go over it,
aren't you, B?

40:13.612 --> 40:15.313
You can't handle watching me
living my own way,

40:15.346 --> 40:16.648
having a blast,
because it tempts you.

40:16.681 --> 40:18.282
You know it could be you.

40:21.487 --> 40:23.221
There's my girl.

40:23.253 --> 40:24.722
No, I'm not gonna do this.

40:24.755 --> 40:26.224
Why not?
It feels good.

40:26.257 --> 40:27.358
Blood rising--

40:29.994 --> 40:31.996
(grunts)

40:33.498 --> 40:34.865
(vampires growling)

40:36.367 --> 40:39.003
(grunting)

40:57.956 --> 41:00.726
Aah!

41:05.864 --> 41:08.233
(grunting)

41:32.023 --> 41:34.760
(gasping)

41:47.072 --> 41:49.574
(growling)

41:49.608 --> 41:51.742
I hear once you've
tasted a slayer,

41:51.777 --> 41:54.045
you never want to go back.

41:54.079 --> 41:55.146
(Faith shouts)

41:55.179 --> 41:56.681
Oh!

41:56.715 --> 41:59.083
Oh, no.

41:59.117 --> 42:01.586
No, this is no good at all.

42:19.737 --> 42:22.039
So she saved you.

42:22.072 --> 42:24.541
She could have left me
there to die, Giles,

42:24.576 --> 42:27.177
but she didn't.

42:27.211 --> 42:30.181
She opted to come back
to town with you then.

42:30.215 --> 42:32.550
That bodes well.

42:34.619 --> 42:35.887
She still has a lot to face

42:35.920 --> 42:38.188
before she can
put this behind her.

42:38.222 --> 42:40.291
I'm not gonna give up on her.

42:40.324 --> 42:42.860
(sighs)

42:42.893 --> 42:45.429
Then I think
she stands a chance.

43:07.518 --> 43:09.954
You sent your boy to kill me.

43:09.987 --> 43:12.958
That's right, I did.

43:12.990 --> 43:14.726
He's dust.

43:14.760 --> 43:16.061
I thought he might be,

43:16.094 --> 43:17.996
what, with you
standing here and all.

43:19.831 --> 43:23.835
I guess that means
you have a job opening.

44:07.746 --> 44:10.215
Grr. Argh.
