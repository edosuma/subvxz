00:54.488 --> 00:55.289
- Come on.

01:18.779 --> 01:19.780
Ah, come on.

01:26.420 --> 01:27.221
- What's your trouble?

01:27.221 --> 01:29.323
- God, whoa, what are...

01:31.692 --> 01:33.527
Where'd you come from?

01:34.795 --> 01:36.964
- Where did you come from?

01:38.232 --> 01:39.032
- That way.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.635
- Well I came from that way.

01:45.339 --> 01:47.475
I'm not a hatchet murderer.

01:47.475 --> 01:49.042
- Why would you say that?

01:49.042 --> 01:50.678
- You look like
you're having trouble.

01:50.678 --> 01:52.012
- Yeah.

01:52.012 --> 01:54.047
Yeah I don't know
much about cars.

01:54.047 --> 01:55.516
- Cars.

01:55.516 --> 01:56.450
Right.

02:04.392 --> 02:06.194
He might want to know
you're broke down.

02:08.862 --> 02:10.330
- Not likely.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.400
He has plenty of other
people to worry about now.

02:14.902 --> 02:15.703
- Well.

02:17.371 --> 02:19.740
Looks like you could
uses some help.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.575
- Do you know how to fix cars?

02:21.575 --> 02:22.410
- Cars.

02:23.344 --> 02:24.878
Right.

02:26.947 --> 02:29.583
- It just started smoking.

02:31.319 --> 02:33.954
- Well, that's steam, not smoke.

02:33.954 --> 02:36.089
- Whatever, can you fix it?

02:37.758 --> 02:39.260
- Why now?

02:39.260 --> 02:40.093
- Why now?

02:40.093 --> 02:41.028
Why now what?

02:41.028 --> 02:44.097
- Well, you said that your dad

02:44.097 --> 02:47.067
didn't have time for
people right now.

02:47.968 --> 02:49.169
Why now?

02:49.169 --> 02:49.970
- Nothing man.

02:53.807 --> 02:56.577
He's getting remarried, he'll
be starting a new family.

02:56.577 --> 02:57.878
Good for him.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.613
Yeah it's really none
of your business.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.415
Steam, not smoke,
what does that mean?

03:01.415 --> 03:02.616
Can you fix that?

03:02.616 --> 03:05.286
- Steam means you're
leaking water, not oil.

03:07.588 --> 03:12.192
Maybe your dad wants you
to make it your business.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.461
- I don't care.

03:14.862 --> 03:18.198
- I usually like to start
with what's easiest you know.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.734
In this case it's
your radiator cap.

03:23.404 --> 03:24.238
Cap's good.

03:25.339 --> 03:27.207
- So can you fix it?

03:27.207 --> 03:28.876
- I know a little bit.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.912
- What did like your dad
teach you or something?

03:31.912 --> 03:33.013
- Something like that.

03:34.348 --> 03:37.150
You know when I was
your age I had a car.

03:45.726 --> 03:46.994
Woo.

03:46.994 --> 03:48.128
Steamy.

03:48.128 --> 03:51.332
- No this is smokey.
- Whatever.

03:51.332 --> 03:53.801
- The question is
why is this smokey?

03:53.801 --> 03:56.704
- The question is why do I care?

03:56.704 --> 03:57.671
- I beg your pardon?

03:58.572 --> 04:00.107
- Nothing.

04:00.107 --> 04:02.510
- You know this car is only
part of your Christmas gift.

04:03.511 --> 04:06.880
The other part is this.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.616
- I already got two of these.

04:08.616 --> 04:13.621
- This, us, fixing,
bonding, mother son moments.

04:14.655 --> 04:15.489
- I'm hungry.

04:17.358 --> 04:20.160
- Well your dad's gonna be
back with takeout soon enough

04:20.160 --> 04:22.496
and we're gonna talk about
the rosebush over dinner.

04:22.496 --> 04:24.598
We need to plant the
rosebush over dinner.

04:24.598 --> 04:28.268
- Come on it's New Year's Eve.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.905
Grace, can't you like
just fix me something,

04:31.905 --> 04:34.542
like tasty and not takeout?

04:34.542 --> 04:36.910
- My name is Mom or Mother.
- Mom.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.712
- And I don't care
what day it is,

04:38.712 --> 04:40.914
we're gonna talk
about today's roses--

04:40.914 --> 04:42.516
- Mom.
- And today's thorns.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.452
Just like we did yesterday.
- Mom, yeah.

04:44.452 --> 04:46.454
- And the day before that.
- Mm-hm.

04:46.454 --> 04:51.291
- And the day before that.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.728
- God.

05:14.415 --> 05:16.484
What do we got?

05:37.270 --> 05:38.372
- Yes, oh.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.108
Awesome.

05:41.108 --> 05:42.309
Jack's gonna love this.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.282
Love it.
- This is from her?

05:50.951 --> 05:53.053
- Jack.
- This is from her?

05:53.053 --> 05:54.822
- I just got it.
- You hid this from me?

05:54.822 --> 05:56.289
- We were gonna sit you
down when your dad got home.

05:56.289 --> 05:57.791
- Whatever Grace, this
wasn't yours to keep from me.

05:57.791 --> 05:58.826
- Listen--
- Stop!

05:58.826 --> 06:00.260
- No listen, listen.
- No!

06:00.260 --> 06:02.029
- Listen, please.
- No!

06:04.164 --> 06:06.066
- Jack!

06:49.677 --> 06:51.812
- This story's
about you isn't it?

06:51.812 --> 06:53.413
- Maybe.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.449
- So your mom taught
you how to fix cars.

06:55.449 --> 06:57.718
Did she teach you how
to fix water leaks?

07:00.153 --> 07:02.523
- Yeah she did teach me
how to fix water leaks.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.493
She tried to teach me
all kinds of stuff,

07:05.493 --> 07:07.795
but I was usually
too angry to listen

07:08.896 --> 07:10.831
or I was too distracted
to pay attention.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.604
So I dipped my hair in soy
sauce, cut it off, and ate it.

07:18.338 --> 07:19.172
- What?

07:22.275 --> 07:24.978
- I have been angry all my life,

07:24.978 --> 07:27.615
but never as mad as
I was that night.

07:27.615 --> 07:31.819
A 17 year old has an artful
way of doing furious.

07:31.819 --> 07:33.086
- Why?

07:33.086 --> 07:34.988
- I had always known
that I was adopted.

07:35.889 --> 07:37.257
They never kept it from me.

08:44.457 --> 08:45.292
Hi.

08:51.164 --> 08:52.966
- Sweet ride.

08:52.966 --> 08:55.535
What is that, like a
Supra or something?

08:55.535 --> 08:57.905
Whatever it is
deserves a high five.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.039
Do you know how to high five?

08:59.039 --> 08:59.973
You gonna do it?

08:59.973 --> 09:00.774
Give me a high five together.

09:00.774 --> 09:01.775
Together, here we go.

09:01.775 --> 09:02.776
Boom.

09:02.776 --> 09:03.911
Right on.

09:03.911 --> 09:05.979
Hey I'm Marty P.
Handlethorpe the second.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.715
This is my brother Marty
P. Handlethorpe the third.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.216
We're with Marty P.
Handlethorpe Refreshment

09:09.216 --> 09:11.118
Dispenser Refill and Repair.

09:11.118 --> 09:13.453
Our--

09:16.356 --> 09:21.061
You in need of any refreshment
dispenser repair of any sort?

09:21.061 --> 09:22.462
I'll tell you what,
let me get you a card.

09:22.462 --> 09:24.665
You do find yourself
in need of any...

09:26.499 --> 09:28.636
Actually I'll tell you what,
let me know if you want a card

09:28.636 --> 09:30.170
and then I'll write
one up for you.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.471
In the meantime you can check
out the side of the van.

09:31.471 --> 09:33.073
It's got all of our information.

09:36.677 --> 09:41.682
Oh the soda machine is
broken, but never fear,

09:43.050 --> 09:44.618
we'll have it working
before the end of the night.

09:44.618 --> 09:45.919
One more for good measure?

09:47.087 --> 09:48.221
There it goes.

09:48.221 --> 09:49.056
Alright.

09:52.592 --> 09:53.794
You gonna pick those up

09:53.794 --> 09:56.529
or are you just gonna
leave them there?

09:56.529 --> 09:59.800
- No I'm looking for
Old Old Chickasha Valley

09:59.800 --> 10:01.401
County Line Road North.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.136
I can't find it on my map.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.604
It's gotta be a typo right?

10:04.604 --> 10:07.741
I mean I found Old Chickasha
Valley County Line Road.

10:07.741 --> 10:08.842
- Ain't a typo.

10:11.078 --> 10:14.782
- Son, come on in take a seat
wherever there isn't a sitter.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.016
We'll be right with you.

10:16.016 --> 10:18.451
- The problem is you
have an incomplete map.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.089
And that ain't awesome.
- What?

10:22.089 --> 10:24.591
- But don't worry I got
plenty of maps in the back

10:24.591 --> 10:25.959
and you need a map.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.429
That could be
potentially awesome.

10:29.429 --> 10:32.299
As awesome as a nun in nylons.

10:36.003 --> 10:36.804
- Hey.

10:39.072 --> 10:40.440
I ain't for staring at.

10:40.440 --> 10:41.775
- Oh, no I wasn't.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.144
- Gus.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.186
Thank you for stopping.

10:53.186 --> 10:57.590
Can I get you something to drink
while you look at the menu?

11:06.399 --> 11:08.769
- Some fuel, on the house.

11:08.769 --> 11:11.204
- No, thanks.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.340
- Well you know if you weren't
gonna pay for it anyway

11:13.340 --> 11:15.108
I really didn't
lose out on a sale.

11:16.309 --> 11:17.978
Besides I haven't heard
of a place shutting down

11:17.978 --> 11:20.313
because they poured
too much coffee.

11:20.313 --> 11:21.715
Looks like you could use it.

11:22.883 --> 11:23.717
Order in.

11:25.919 --> 11:27.921
- Well it's not for me is it?

11:27.921 --> 11:29.322
- Order could be for anyone.

11:31.892 --> 11:35.929
- Hey Mister will you look
at this huh?

11:35.929 --> 11:37.197
- That's a lot of maps.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.698
- I gotta lot of maps of places

11:38.698 --> 11:39.933
I want to go to when I retire.

11:39.933 --> 11:42.035
I never go nowhere so
I got a lot of maps.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.174
Hey kid.
- Me?

11:47.174 --> 11:50.744
- Yeah you, you're the only
kid here, what's your name?

13:26.139 --> 13:27.440
We're not classically trained,

13:27.440 --> 13:28.708
but we do have a
passion for movement

13:28.708 --> 13:32.279
that translates
pretty clear to...

13:32.279 --> 13:34.882
You're talking, you're
not talking, sure.

13:36.083 --> 13:38.118

13:38.118 --> 13:39.652

13:39.652 --> 13:42.689
Good, yeah we're

13:42.689 --> 13:45.392

of Chickasha Valley.

13:45.392 --> 13:50.030
This is South Chick
and oh here we go.

13:50.030 --> 13:53.466
North Chickasha Valley.
- Maps too old.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.736
- Oh he's right.

13:56.736 --> 13:59.739
This is copy written 1972.

13:59.739 --> 14:03.010
Hmm, so it only has County
Line and Old County Line on it.

14:03.010 --> 14:05.178
They added another County Line.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.814
- They changed the
actual county line.

14:07.814 --> 14:10.217
- Which turned County
Line into Old County Line

14:10.217 --> 14:13.720
and Old County Line into
Old Old County Line.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.588
Oh my gosh, Amos when
did they change that?

14:15.588 --> 14:16.856
- 76.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.826
- Right so we need
a map that came--

14:19.826 --> 14:21.161
- After 76.

14:21.161 --> 14:22.896
- Hey thanks Gus.
- Here we go.

14:25.832 --> 14:30.837
This is copy written 1980,
North Chickasha Valley.

14:32.239 --> 14:33.240
- That's the map, that's
one of my favorite-ist maps.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.541
That map is more awesome

14:34.541 --> 14:37.877
than a monkey on bicycle
on a Sunday.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.779
- See you're okay, you
didn't miss anything.

14:39.779 --> 14:42.582
All you have to do is
go up highway about--

14:42.582 --> 14:43.416
- Six miles.

14:43.416 --> 14:44.351
- Yep.
- Yep.

14:44.351 --> 14:46.353
- Would you look at that.

14:46.353 --> 14:48.655
Yep, I think I've got it.

14:48.655 --> 14:49.722
Here.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.324
- Keep it.
- What?

14:51.324 --> 14:52.559
- Yeah keep it.

14:52.559 --> 14:53.994
- Yeah and your
order's ready too.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.462
- I didn't order anything.

14:55.462 --> 14:58.331
- Oh well then I guess I didn't
miss out on a sale then huh?

14:58.331 --> 15:00.100
Besides this isn't on the menu.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.702
- You know she's got a keen
eye for what people need.

15:02.702 --> 15:05.372
- Hard egg sandwich
with mustard and ketchup

15:05.372 --> 15:08.241
and onions and pickled
okra and peaches

15:08.241 --> 15:09.876
with a side of peanut
butter waffle fries

15:09.876 --> 15:11.111
and barbecue sauce.

15:11.111 --> 15:12.479
- That's my favorite.

15:12.479 --> 15:13.413
- Disgusting.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.647
- Looks who's talking.

15:14.647 --> 15:16.649
I once saw Gus eat
a tuna sandwich

15:16.649 --> 15:18.551
that he dropped into
his chocolate milk

15:18.551 --> 15:19.886
and then drank the
whole thing up.

15:19.886 --> 15:21.388
- Well it was my meal.

15:21.388 --> 15:22.555
- Well it's his sandwich.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.024
- No seriously I
can't just take this.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.492
Let me give you some money.

15:25.492 --> 15:27.560
- Oh that won't do anybody
any good around here.

15:27.560 --> 15:30.397
- Just take it, nobody else
in the world would eat that.

15:30.397 --> 15:32.632
- Actually Marty
would totally go down

15:32.632 --> 15:35.302
on all those peanut butter
barbecue waffle fries if--

15:36.269 --> 15:37.604
- Take it.

15:37.604 --> 15:38.471
- Well thank you.

15:42.542 --> 15:45.212
Thank you so much.

15:48.015 --> 15:48.848
- Hey buddy.

15:49.716 --> 15:50.850
Happy New Year.

15:58.091 --> 15:59.826
- What's a matter baby?

16:02.729 --> 16:03.796
Okay come on.

16:07.634 --> 16:08.468
Good evening.

16:09.936 --> 16:12.672
My name is Maybelline, but
everyone calls me Mae-Bee

16:12.672 --> 16:14.807
and this here is Miss Francis.

16:16.476 --> 16:19.079
- I'm sorry.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.513
- You got this.

16:20.513 --> 16:23.150
- I'm really sorry I didn't
get your order before.

16:23.150 --> 16:24.084
- Oh.

16:24.084 --> 16:25.552
No it's okay, it's not big deal.

16:28.388 --> 16:31.691
- Hi, welcome to
The Griddle House.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.826
Can I get you something to drink

16:33.826 --> 16:35.528
while you take a
look at the menu?

16:37.564 --> 16:40.433
You know I'm not
dumb or nothing.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.835
- No, I don't think you're dumb.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.737
- We'll both be taking
care of you tonight.

16:44.737 --> 16:49.742
Can we interest you in maybe
some coffee or hot cocoa?

16:50.910 --> 16:52.645
- Oh yeah, with
some marshmallows?

16:52.645 --> 16:53.813
- With some marshmallows?

16:53.813 --> 16:56.216
- Yes, sure, thank you.
- Okay, which one?

17:00.353 --> 17:04.156
- Yeah, whichever you think.

17:04.156 --> 17:06.626
Yeah I don't really
know what I want.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.262
- I'll figure it out.

17:09.262 --> 17:10.363
- Okay.
- Okay.

17:10.363 --> 17:11.531
- We'll figure it out.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.599
- But thank you, both of you.
- Yeah.

17:18.070 --> 17:19.106
- Excuse me ma'am.

17:19.106 --> 17:20.740
- Yeah, yeah, yes?

17:20.740 --> 17:21.973
Philip right?
- Yeah.

17:21.973 --> 17:24.977
I don't think you're dumb.

17:24.977 --> 17:27.780
You know you just,
you seem nervous.

17:27.780 --> 17:31.050
Are you, you know,
nervous for any reason?

17:32.485 --> 17:34.053
- I mean I'm mostly nervous

17:34.053 --> 17:37.457
when I have to talk
to people or whatever.

17:38.991 --> 17:43.963
- But you're not like specifically
nervous about anything?

17:47.734 --> 17:49.436
- Close.
- Close.

17:49.436 --> 17:50.770
- Close.
- Close.

17:52.839 --> 17:57.844
Was that guy in here before
like famous or something?

18:00.347 --> 18:01.881
- Oh why?

18:01.881 --> 18:03.983
Did he look famous?
- No.

18:03.983 --> 18:06.052
I mean I don't know.

18:06.052 --> 18:08.388
You all just treated him so nice

18:08.388 --> 18:09.456
like he was famous or something.

18:09.456 --> 18:12.259
- Well, you know, service first.

18:12.259 --> 18:13.926
- Service, I mean free food.

18:15.061 --> 18:19.065
Free coffee, free
map, a musical number.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.470
- Okay, I went ahead and
made the decision for you.

18:23.470 --> 18:26.639
Hot cocoa with marshmallows.
- Thank you.

18:28.040 --> 18:31.411
- Now listen I take my
marshmallows very seriously.

18:31.411 --> 18:33.513
The amount of marshmallows
in your hot cocoa

18:33.513 --> 18:35.582
is directly correlated to
the kind of you're having.

18:35.582 --> 18:39.018
So the worse the day the bigger
the handful of marshmallows.

18:39.018 --> 18:41.488
- She did the math.
- I've done the math.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.156
- She did the math.

18:43.156 --> 18:46.793
- So we figure we just leave
that big decision to you.

18:48.761 --> 18:49.962
I'll--

18:49.962 --> 18:52.499
- No I got it, it's
fine thank you.

18:55.302 --> 18:57.637
Yeah, yeah, this
is fine, thank you.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.343
- Well I suppose it's
none of our business

19:03.343 --> 19:05.512
what kind of marshmallow
day you're having.

19:06.646 --> 19:09.115
Okay let us know if
you need anything else.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.485
- Okay let us know if you
need anything else okay?

19:12.485 --> 19:15.788
- Yes, thank you
ma'am, both of you.

19:17.624 --> 19:19.426
- I don't
mind saying this,

19:19.426 --> 19:20.660
y'all have wrecked my machine.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.161
- You know I'm not
completely sure

19:22.161 --> 19:24.664
what happened to the
machine in the first place.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.534
- Well I didn't do anything,
all I did was this.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.669
- Why, why no, why
would you do that?

19:29.669 --> 19:31.070
Were you trying to get soda

19:31.070 --> 19:32.672
or were you trying to
establish dominance?

19:32.672 --> 19:33.673
- Well after a bit

19:33.673 --> 19:35.107
it stopped doing
anything at all.

19:35.107 --> 19:37.444
- Oh you mean when you
broke it it stopped working?

19:37.444 --> 19:39.178
That's weird isn't it?

19:39.178 --> 19:41.881
- You know I don't
think I like your tone.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.883
- No ma'am that's just
how I talk sometimes.

19:43.883 --> 19:44.684
- Yeah?

19:45.818 --> 19:47.053
Fix my machine.

19:48.455 --> 19:49.456
Fix it, now.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.094
- She was nice.

19:55.094 --> 19:58.130
A little bit super
terrifying, but pretty nice.

19:58.130 --> 19:58.965
- Yeah.

20:05.171 --> 20:07.640
- So not that I care but who,

20:07.640 --> 20:10.243
which lady was it, was
it Mae-Berry or whatever?

20:10.243 --> 20:12.379
- Mae-Bee or Francis.

20:13.546 --> 20:16.283
I was no more close
to having that answer.

20:16.283 --> 20:18.150
The investigation
had only just begun

20:18.150 --> 20:23.155
and there was a new development,
another suspect as it were.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.658
Take that.

20:43.476 --> 20:45.378
- Good evening.
- Evening Tiny.

20:45.378 --> 20:47.480
- Already?
- Blame the clock.

20:47.480 --> 20:51.150
- Tricky old evening, showing
up at the end of every day

20:51.150 --> 20:53.353
whether we ask it or not.

20:53.353 --> 20:55.121
- Hello to you too Gus.

20:55.121 --> 20:56.623
- Just like clockwork.

20:56.623 --> 20:57.657
- Depends on a clock.

20:58.791 --> 20:59.992
- Hi Tiny.
- Hi.

21:01.127 --> 21:02.061
- There you go.

21:02.061 --> 21:04.897
- Everyone, meet Magic Clock,

21:05.765 --> 21:08.635
Magic Clock meet everyone.

21:08.635 --> 21:10.102
- Tiny.

21:10.102 --> 21:13.406
- This little thing takes the
night out of the day easy.

21:13.406 --> 21:16.008
- Easy come, easy go.

21:16.008 --> 21:17.844
- Exactly my point, bye bye.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.548
- You ready
set for your regular?

21:21.548 --> 21:25.585
- Yep, set 'em up side
by side straight up.

21:25.585 --> 21:27.019
- You got it.

21:27.019 --> 21:29.656
- This is gonna warm your heart
on its way to your stomach

21:29.656 --> 21:32.659
and that's awesomer
than a 24 hour sun rise.

21:32.659 --> 21:36.162
I'll even put extra chocolate
chips in here just for you.

21:36.162 --> 21:37.196
- Thanks Amos, I think I'm just

21:37.196 --> 21:38.665
gonna stick to my holy trinity.

21:38.665 --> 21:41.468
- Java jitter Joe extra
hot, coming right up.

21:42.669 --> 21:44.371
- No, no, don't waste 'em.
- What?

21:44.371 --> 21:45.672
- The saucers.

21:45.672 --> 21:47.507
- Don't be silly, you
know it ain't a waste.

21:51.811 --> 21:52.612
Give me the gum.

21:57.016 --> 21:57.950
Thank you.
- Oh hold up.

21:57.950 --> 21:58.751
Got another one?

22:02.855 --> 22:04.090
- Tough one?

22:04.090 --> 22:05.458
- Depends on how
you're calling it.

22:07.394 --> 22:10.430
I bet the way we call
it is about as different

22:10.430 --> 22:12.699
as sinners from sins.

22:12.699 --> 22:15.968
- You know Tiny there
ain't nothing between us

22:15.968 --> 22:18.471
but this little old counter.

22:18.471 --> 22:19.839
We are not that different.

22:19.839 --> 22:22.842
- Yeah but over there
you can tell folks

22:22.842 --> 22:25.044
what you do for a living
at the PTA meeting

22:25.044 --> 22:30.049
and over here well I
ain't never been to one,

22:31.217 --> 22:34.253
so this counter might
as well be the Red Sea.

22:35.655 --> 22:38.257
- Well you know the Red Sea
wasn't uncrossable Tiny.

22:40.159 --> 22:41.928
- You can believe that.

22:41.928 --> 22:43.730
- Well then it
was a different Sea.

22:43.730 --> 22:48.768
- Put your glasses on, this
is a bridge, not a sea.

22:48.768 --> 22:51.270
- Nope, looks just
like a sea to me.

22:51.270 --> 22:53.072
- Blind as a bat.

22:53.072 --> 22:54.607
- Gus.

22:54.607 --> 22:57.677
- Oh well that is a well broke
in Mom is disappointed voice

22:57.677 --> 22:59.779
if I've ever heard one.

22:59.779 --> 23:01.681
Little Jackson must
love hearing that

23:01.681 --> 23:03.082
whenever he ignores his chores.

23:03.082 --> 23:04.817
- Oh, you alright there
let me get that for you.

23:04.817 --> 23:06.085
Are you okay?

23:07.854 --> 23:09.456
- I'm so sorry.

23:09.456 --> 23:12.091
- Oh no you don't have to be
sorry for me to do my job.

23:12.091 --> 23:13.693
That's my job.

23:13.693 --> 23:17.964
- Did you hear what she
said he son's name was?

23:17.964 --> 23:19.666
- Jackson.
- Jackson?

23:20.533 --> 23:21.868
- Jackson.

23:21.868 --> 23:24.170
- Thanks, thank you.
- Sure thing.

23:26.205 --> 23:27.039
- God.

23:34.080 --> 23:34.914
Son's...

23:38.785 --> 23:41.888
- Oh no way, no way.

23:41.888 --> 23:43.322
What're you working on?

23:43.322 --> 23:46.826
You're a writer too.
- What, no.

23:46.826 --> 23:48.294
No.

23:48.294 --> 23:51.598
- I'm sorry, I thought I
recognized a fellow writer.

23:51.598 --> 23:56.603
- Oh no this was, it
was a work in nothing.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.038
- Oh I see.

23:59.038 --> 24:01.173
Well you see, I
mean I'm a writer.

24:01.173 --> 24:02.675
I'm fourth on the waiting list

24:02.675 --> 24:04.911
over at Mr. Duvet's class
at Paxton College, yeah.

24:06.045 --> 24:07.847
Oh god, I don't know
why I said it like that,

24:07.847 --> 24:12.519
like you really know who Mr.
Duvet was at Paxton College.

24:12.519 --> 24:13.920
Yeah, okay.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.054
Well you need anything?

24:15.988 --> 24:17.490
- No, no thank you.

24:17.490 --> 24:19.025
I'm fine, great.
- Okay great.

24:19.025 --> 24:21.260
Well you just let me know
if you need anything okay?

24:21.260 --> 24:22.394
- Yes.

24:33.640 --> 24:36.876
- Now all that
caffeine and no food?

24:36.876 --> 24:37.977
Everybody's gotta eat.

24:39.779 --> 24:42.381
That was my mom voice.
- Not hungry Mae-Bee.

24:42.381 --> 24:45.051
- Come on Tiny, please
let me whoop you up

24:45.051 --> 24:46.886
a New Year's Eve feast.

24:48.054 --> 24:51.057
- Well looky at that,
just exactly enough time

24:51.057 --> 24:54.694
to dump three cups of coffee
straight up, no chaser.

24:54.694 --> 24:57.229
Oh no need for you
to make extra work.

24:57.229 --> 24:59.098
- It's no trouble Tiny.

25:00.533 --> 25:02.935
After all this time don't
you know you're no trouble.

25:04.370 --> 25:07.173
- My momma would've begged
to differ with you on that.

25:07.173 --> 25:09.709
- Here's the deal, I
thought my mom was weird

25:09.709 --> 25:12.378
and I didn't like it,
it made me feel weird.

25:13.580 --> 25:16.115
At The Griddle House
I was hoping to find

25:16.115 --> 25:21.087
some sense of normalcy

wasn't at The Griddle House.

26:52.011 --> 26:53.479
- He's in a really good mood.

26:53.479 --> 26:54.981
- You don't
know the half of it.

26:54.981 --> 26:56.248
He loves that seat.

26:56.248 --> 26:59.351
Oh he sits on it like a
chicken sits with eggs.

26:59.351 --> 27:01.453
- What can we do
to help you Officer Darcy?

27:01.453 --> 27:04.223
- Well I'd like you to
meet my new partner.

27:04.223 --> 27:05.391
- Dude.

27:05.391 --> 27:07.794
- Hey your partner's
got handcuffs.

27:07.794 --> 27:10.863
- I ain't a cop.
- Fine.

27:10.863 --> 27:14.767
My new friend, Mason
the delinquent.

27:14.767 --> 27:16.268
And I was wondering
if we could get

27:16.268 --> 27:18.204
a couple slices
of your apple pie?

27:18.204 --> 27:19.405
- Oh yeah.

27:19.405 --> 27:22.608
- Apple pie, who
are you Ward Clever?

27:24.110 --> 27:25.945
- Somebody's been
watching Nick at Night huh?

27:25.945 --> 27:27.747
- Apple pie coming up.

27:27.747 --> 27:29.415
- You're weird.

27:29.415 --> 27:32.451
- Your definition of weird
has a bit of wiggle room huh?

27:32.451 --> 27:34.420
I mean polite society
would consider

27:34.420 --> 27:35.788
the shoplifter the weird one.

27:35.788 --> 27:38.725
- Alleged shoplifter.
- Witnessed shoplifter.

27:38.725 --> 27:41.260
Uh-oh, you hear that?

27:41.260 --> 27:42.094
Uh huh.

27:43.295 --> 27:44.864
This is Officer Darcy go ahead.

27:47.066 --> 27:51.938
That's a 10-4, and
that sounds serious.

27:51.938 --> 27:53.339
- Dude there's no one talking.

27:53.339 --> 27:55.107
- I'm on my way.
- You doing a skit?

27:55.107 --> 27:56.909
- Amos could you make
my apple pie to go

27:56.909 --> 27:58.244
and could I get a
to go cup of coffee?

27:58.244 --> 28:00.079
- Sure thing, that
sounds serious.

28:00.079 --> 28:01.047
- It is, yeah.

28:01.047 --> 28:03.649
It's 12-18-43,

28:03.649 --> 28:06.018
that's breaking and
entering while wearing PJs.

28:07.186 --> 28:08.687
And getting an ice
cream brain freeze.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.489
- There's no rest
for the wicked,

28:10.489 --> 28:12.825
especially on New Year's.
- What?

28:12.825 --> 28:15.594
- And I don't know if I can
risk it with my new partner.

28:15.594 --> 28:16.796
- I understand.

28:16.796 --> 28:18.364
- Do you think he could
stay here for a few

28:18.364 --> 28:19.932
while I go check things out?

28:19.932 --> 28:21.167
- No.

28:21.167 --> 28:21.834
- Anything
for our men in blue.

28:21.834 --> 28:23.502
- No way, what?

28:23.502 --> 28:25.271
- It's for your own good.

28:25.271 --> 28:28.407
Now PJ B and E that's
pretty dangerous.

28:33.179 --> 28:37.383
- Man, man I'm gonna,

28:37.383 --> 28:39.852
I'm gonna file a
thing against you man.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.522
You can't do this,
I know my rights.

28:43.522 --> 28:45.191
- It's for your own good.

28:45.191 --> 28:46.793
I'll be back for you
as soon as I can.

28:46.793 --> 28:47.827
- Come on man.

28:49.295 --> 28:53.199
- Thank you so much and
tell Tiny I say hey.

28:53.199 --> 28:55.667
- Will do.

28:56.903 --> 28:58.137
- Gus.
- Officer.

29:07.613 --> 29:09.849
- Nice American steel,
that ain't gonna help.

29:11.617 --> 29:13.119
- Is he coming back?

29:13.119 --> 29:16.155
- If Officer Darcy says he's
coming back he's coming back.

29:16.155 --> 29:18.624
He takes his own life into his
hands when he steps out there

29:18.624 --> 29:20.860
so you can sit
here and have pie.

29:20.860 --> 29:23.562
I'd just shut up and
eat it and be grateful.

29:23.562 --> 29:24.997
- Don't try to intimidate me.

29:28.300 --> 29:29.135
Ow.

29:33.906 --> 29:37.509
Jesus H Christ.

29:39.311 --> 29:40.412
- First date?

29:41.313 --> 29:42.214
Nice.

29:48.454 --> 29:50.689
- Little red robot
eyes fade away?

29:50.689 --> 29:52.558
- Robot eyes?

29:52.558 --> 29:55.561
Dude I think this lady's crazy.

29:59.498 --> 30:02.068
Yo, what's your deal?

30:04.203 --> 30:06.372
- My time isn't free.
- What?

30:08.174 --> 30:09.008
Oh.

30:09.876 --> 30:12.244
Oh are you like a...

30:16.248 --> 30:17.616
You are.

30:17.616 --> 30:18.951
You are aren't you.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.922
Hey why is she free?

30:22.922 --> 30:26.458
I'm the one cuffed up and
she gets to walk all over

30:26.458 --> 30:28.294
this restaurant like
she owns the place?

30:28.294 --> 30:31.230
And the, oh I'm sorry, you
get to walk the restaurant

30:31.230 --> 30:33.632
and the streets of course right?

30:33.632 --> 30:35.767
- I'm not free.
- What?

30:35.767 --> 30:38.737
- Officer Darcy asked
me to tell you that--

30:38.737 --> 30:41.040
- Oh I heard him.
- You did, well,

30:42.241 --> 30:43.675
look I don't want
to hear no from you.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.311
You take this, eat it on the go.

30:45.311 --> 30:47.079
You know that wind out
there is pretty strong.

30:47.079 --> 30:49.781
It'll just blow you away
like a dandelion head

30:49.781 --> 30:51.017
if you don't put on some weight.

30:51.017 --> 30:53.085
- Not the wind she
needs to worry about.

30:53.085 --> 30:56.488
- I cooked this, it's awesomer
than two kittens playing

30:56.488 --> 30:57.957
paddywack with a ball of yarn.

30:59.391 --> 31:01.193
- Thank you for the food,

31:01.193 --> 31:04.430
but look out, the
advice for nothing.

31:05.497 --> 31:06.432
Bye all.

31:07.900 --> 31:11.003
- Hey hey hey, Tiny, what am
I chopped onions over here?

31:13.472 --> 31:14.306
- You're...

31:16.408 --> 31:17.809
As god as my witness you are

31:17.809 --> 31:20.679
the only friend
that I've ever had.

31:20.679 --> 31:22.114
Sorry to be so much
trouble for you.

31:22.114 --> 31:23.515
- Wait, wait, Tiny, Tiny.

31:23.515 --> 31:24.750
Listen, listen.

31:24.750 --> 31:26.518
You know that I
love my crosswords

31:26.518 --> 31:28.054
like pig likes stink right

31:28.054 --> 31:30.356
and to leave them un-worked
well it just makes me crazy

31:30.356 --> 31:33.125
and I really need some
help here you know?

31:33.125 --> 31:35.928
Nine letters, starts
with an N, ends with an E

31:35.928 --> 31:39.031
and the clue is
Victorian pocket charm.

31:39.031 --> 31:40.632
Can you help me with that?

31:40.632 --> 31:41.433
It's--

31:43.269 --> 31:45.604
- Not gonna work Mae-Bee.

31:45.604 --> 31:47.606
See you the day after the day.

31:47.606 --> 31:48.674
- Tiny, Tiny.

31:49.775 --> 31:50.776
- Seriously?

31:50.776 --> 31:52.511
That's not fair.

31:57.984 --> 31:58.951
- Mae-Bee.

31:58.951 --> 32:00.552
- Yeah hon, what do you need?

32:00.552 --> 32:02.588
- The day after what day?

32:02.588 --> 32:03.389
- Oh.

32:04.390 --> 32:05.224
Tomorrow.

32:08.460 --> 32:11.397
- New Year's?
- And her birthday.

32:11.397 --> 32:12.898
She's meaning to skip both.

32:19.238 --> 32:22.874
- So what Teeny was your mom?
- Tiny.

32:22.874 --> 32:24.410
- Tiny, she was your mom right?

32:25.411 --> 32:26.645
- It was weird.

32:26.645 --> 32:28.314
I had it narrowed down
to these three women

32:28.314 --> 32:31.817
and yet I never felt further
away from the answer.

32:33.319 --> 32:35.054
- Yeah you're not gonna
tell me yet are you?

32:43.295 --> 32:46.298
- Which birthday?
- 34 or 35.

32:46.298 --> 32:47.899
- Yeah somewhere in there.

32:49.135 --> 32:51.270
- Tiny's older than
that on the inside.

32:51.270 --> 32:54.240
- Sounds like Tiny's
having a little trouble.

32:55.774 --> 32:58.344
Gus you barely get off
that stool to go pee.

32:59.711 --> 33:01.980
What grabbed your
attention outside before?

33:01.980 --> 33:04.383
- I just needed some fresh air.

33:05.651 --> 33:07.653
- Uh-huh.

33:07.653 --> 33:08.487
- Thank you.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.935
- I tried every trick
I knew, it didn't work.

33:23.935 --> 33:27.173
Not even one little crank.

33:28.574 --> 33:31.510
- You know what I'll go
out and see what I can see.

33:31.510 --> 33:33.612
- I didn't even know
this dude could talk.

33:34.813 --> 33:36.715
- You know what I
try to keep quiet

33:36.715 --> 33:38.684
unless I have something
helpful to say.

33:41.053 --> 33:45.324
- Yeah, well no one
cares what a bow tied

33:45.324 --> 33:50.329
100 year old bus boy has
to say about anything.

33:51.197 --> 33:52.331
- What am I gonna do Mae-Bee?

33:52.331 --> 33:53.965
This can't happen.

33:53.965 --> 33:56.535
New Year's Eve is
busy, bad busy.

33:56.535 --> 33:57.936
No different than Christmas.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.372
- Well maybe this will help?

34:01.873 --> 34:04.376
- I'll just eat this, no
need to trouble yourself.

34:05.811 --> 34:08.447
- You didn't read what I wrote
on top of that box did you?

34:08.447 --> 34:11.117
- I'm blind as a bat without
my glasses and you know that.

34:11.117 --> 34:13.051
- Well get your glasses, I
took the time to write it,

34:13.051 --> 34:14.485
you take the time to read it.

34:17.089 --> 34:19.491
- You're no trouble Tiny.

34:20.759 --> 34:23.529
- Listen this is
what we're gonna do,

34:23.529 --> 34:24.896
we're gonna go
back into my office

34:24.896 --> 34:26.565
and we're gonna
dial up that person

34:26.565 --> 34:28.167
that keeps buzzing your beeper

34:28.167 --> 34:30.235
and we're just gonna
tell them your car

34:30.235 --> 34:32.438
picked a doozy of
a night to break.

34:32.438 --> 34:33.672
And if they don't believe you

34:33.672 --> 34:34.873
they can come on down
to The Griddle House

34:34.873 --> 34:36.242
and see for themselves.

34:43.047 --> 34:44.350
- What's it say?
- What?

34:47.219 --> 34:49.020
911, I don't know
it's just numbers.

34:49.020 --> 34:50.522
- That's his way of talking.

34:50.522 --> 34:51.790
- Well is somebody hurt?

34:51.790 --> 34:53.792
- Well someone's gonna
be if I don't respond.

34:53.792 --> 34:57.263
- Tiny how long has this
man been running you ragged?

34:57.263 --> 34:59.598
- I do what I do
and I can't even,

34:59.598 --> 35:01.333
I can't even make
a stupid phone call

35:01.333 --> 35:02.934
to tell him that my car's broke.

35:04.503 --> 35:06.272
- Wait, no, no.

35:07.739 --> 35:10.409
- Mae-Bee I really appreciate

35:10.409 --> 35:13.512
everything that you've
done for me, I really do,

35:13.512 --> 35:18.150
but sometimes you just gotta
learn when to cut your loses.

35:19.285 --> 35:21.720
- Tiny please,
Tiny that is where

35:21.720 --> 35:25.757
you're sorely mistaken, okay?

35:25.757 --> 35:26.758
I want you to come over here

35:26.758 --> 35:28.394
with me and look
at this picture.

35:29.528 --> 35:32.331
You see that?
- Yeah.

35:32.331 --> 35:35.301
- That is our genesis,
that is where we started.

35:35.301 --> 35:37.336
- So you guys have
been here a long time.

35:37.336 --> 35:38.937
- No Tiny look at that picture.

35:39.905 --> 35:43.041
That picture was taken in 1933

35:43.041 --> 35:45.444
at the height of the Depression.

35:46.778 --> 35:49.215
The Griddle House started
as a soup kitchen.

35:49.215 --> 35:52.117
For years that house gave
away every bit of food

35:52.117 --> 35:57.122
it could chef up so
there is no imposing,

35:57.122 --> 36:00.259
there is no troubling anybody

36:01.860 --> 36:05.364
'cause this building
was made to give

36:05.364 --> 36:07.266
everything it's
got and then some.

36:11.036 --> 36:11.870
Tiny,

36:13.905 --> 36:14.940
I was just like you.

36:14.940 --> 36:17.609
- No.
- Yes I was.

36:20.579 --> 36:23.982
I am living proof of
a life turned around.

36:26.418 --> 36:29.120
I've never told anybody that.

36:34.092 --> 36:35.327
Let's make that call huh?

36:38.897 --> 36:42.067
- My voice is gonna shake.
- End it.

36:55.581 --> 36:56.915
- Johnny.

36:58.617 --> 37:02.288
My car broke, I'm
trying to get it fixed.

37:04.256 --> 37:06.958
I'll get there as soon as I can.

37:11.196 --> 37:12.631
He hung up on me.

37:16.635 --> 37:18.970
I'm sorry.

37:22.674 --> 37:23.675
- It's okay.

37:24.810 --> 37:27.779
It's okay, it's okay.

37:27.779 --> 37:29.748
- Excuse me can I help you?

37:29.748 --> 37:30.982
What are you doing back here?

37:30.982 --> 37:32.117
Are you trying to
steal my recipe

37:32.117 --> 37:34.420
for the best sandwich
in the world?

37:36.355 --> 37:40.191
- Yeah, I'm just
a little lost I guess.

37:40.191 --> 37:41.159
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

37:43.662 --> 37:46.131
Mae-Bee's a strange
name isn't it?

37:46.131 --> 37:47.833
Maybe yes, like maybe no.

37:49.034 --> 37:50.536
- Not really, it's
not her real name,

37:50.536 --> 37:53.071
her real name is Maybelline
like the Chuck Berry song.

37:53.071 --> 37:55.474
It's not an abbreviation
for indecisiveness.

37:56.642 --> 38:01.380
- Oh and Tiny, I mean,
that's a weird one.

38:03.248 --> 38:05.751
- You know I don't even
know what her real name is.

38:05.751 --> 38:06.985
Tiny is all we ever called her.

38:06.985 --> 38:08.687
I gotta ask her
one of these days.

38:09.988 --> 38:13.892
- So how long you been
working here and stuff?

38:13.892 --> 38:15.126
- I was just driving
down the highway,

38:15.126 --> 38:17.228
I stopped here for
a cup of coffee.

38:17.228 --> 38:21.032
It's been 30 years,
I better call home.

38:21.032 --> 38:22.534
- So do you like it?

38:22.534 --> 38:24.035
I mean do you like the people?

38:25.471 --> 38:28.239
- Are you asking me if I
got a crush on somebody?

38:28.239 --> 38:29.508
- No.

38:29.508 --> 38:31.042
- Maybe you have a
crush on somebody?

38:32.611 --> 38:34.279
- No.
- It's okay now.

38:34.279 --> 38:35.814
They're attractive, but a
little old for you but--

38:35.814 --> 38:38.584
- No, no I was just,

38:40.486 --> 38:42.654
I was just wondering
if, you know,

38:42.654 --> 38:45.090
you liked working with
Francis and Mae-Bee.

38:45.090 --> 38:47.893
- Yeah, yeah, I like
working with them.

38:49.294 --> 38:50.195
- What about Tiny?

38:52.898 --> 38:53.999
- Well you know Tiny,

38:56.234 --> 38:57.569
Tiny's different you know.

38:58.970 --> 39:00.539
- Different how?

39:00.539 --> 39:03.041
- She just doesn't know
she's home yet you know.

39:03.041 --> 39:03.875
- Home.

39:06.044 --> 39:06.978
Right.

39:06.978 --> 39:09.848
So you all live around here?

39:11.450 --> 39:12.283
- Yeah.

39:13.452 --> 39:15.153
Paxton might not
be all that much,

39:15.153 --> 39:17.255
but it holds all our hearts.

39:18.256 --> 39:20.191
You know who wrote that?
- Who?

39:20.191 --> 39:21.126
- Francis.

39:50.321 --> 39:51.623
- Excuse me ma'am.

39:51.623 --> 39:54.760
♪ It was a Monday that
felt like a Tuesday ♪

39:54.760 --> 39:56.795
♪ And after noon
turned into night ♪

39:56.795 --> 40:01.099
Yeah I was wondering if I
could ask you some questions?

40:01.099 --> 40:02.233
- Okay.

40:02.233 --> 40:04.402
- Like sit down questions.

40:04.402 --> 40:07.038
You're a writer, this
is like an interview.

40:07.939 --> 40:10.308
- Like for school or something?

40:10.308 --> 40:12.243
- Yeah, yeah for my school.

40:13.645 --> 40:17.315
- Okay, let me just
set these down.

40:20.552 --> 40:24.990
Okay, well, nobody's ever wanted
to interview me before, so.

40:25.924 --> 40:27.258

Rose Beemer, B-E-E-M-E-R.

40:32.498 --> 40:34.700
It's kind of like a fancy
name don't you think?

40:34.700 --> 40:36.535
Kind of famous fancy.

40:37.703 --> 40:39.004
I always thought maybe like

40:39.004 --> 40:41.473
it would be like
Earhart and Beemer.

40:41.473 --> 40:42.874
I could be her
copilot or something,

40:42.874 --> 40:44.476
that's the kind of name it is.

40:44.476 --> 40:45.744
Oh and you know what

40:45.744 --> 40:47.378
I always wanted to
see my name in print

40:47.378 --> 40:48.947

40:50.582 --> 40:51.382
- Okay.

40:58.624 --> 41:00.692
and I have only left
the state three times.

41:01.827 --> 41:04.429

41:04.429 --> 41:07.766
That makes me 36, I'm
a little bit older.

41:10.502 --> 41:13.805
- Okay what is your hair color?

41:13.805 --> 41:17.876
- Well this is actually a rinse,

41:17.876 --> 41:22.881

more like the color brown

41:23.615 --> 41:24.783

41:24.783 --> 41:26.051
- So your hair color's
naturally brown?

41:26.051 --> 41:28.119
- Well I was born as
bald as a cue ball,

41:53.745 --> 41:56.014
- What does that mean?

41:56.014 --> 41:57.348
- Ambidextrous.

41:57.348 --> 41:58.884
It means that I do
things with both hands.

41:58.884 --> 42:01.787

Oh and thanks for the interview.

44:07.378 --> 44:10.248

Tiny, not Francis.

44:10.248 --> 44:12.150
Why don't you just
skip to the end?

44:15.987 --> 44:17.689
- Your car is not fixed yet.

44:30.235 --> 44:33.104
- Help, help, I'm being
held against my will.

44:33.104 --> 44:35.473
Look at this, look at the cuffs.

44:40.611 --> 44:43.715
- I know the feeling,
I used to be married.

44:43.715 --> 44:45.050
- So that's him?

44:45.917 --> 44:46.852
- Trust me.

44:52.791 --> 44:55.961
- Is he gonna do anything?
- Just wait.

45:05.837 --> 45:10.275
- Amos, Amos, you gotta go help
me out and take their order.

45:10.275 --> 45:11.642
- Hold up, isn't that your job?

45:11.642 --> 45:13.578
Cook, waitress, cook, waitress.

45:13.578 --> 45:15.046
- I know, but I just can't,

45:15.046 --> 45:16.681
that's the guy I was
telling you about.

45:16.681 --> 45:19.217
- Who, the writer guy?

45:19.217 --> 45:23.588
- Yes, yes that's Professor
Duvet's writing assistant.

45:23.588 --> 45:26.091
- You certainly can't
give him your writing

45:26.091 --> 45:27.725
if you can't even
take his order.

45:27.725 --> 45:30.929
- I know Gus, that's why
I'm asking for help, please.

45:32.197 --> 45:33.965
Amos don't make me, please.

45:33.965 --> 45:36.267
- No one's making you do
anything, give me that.

45:36.267 --> 45:38.603
- Hold up, we got this.
- No you don't have that.

45:38.603 --> 45:39.704
Fix the machine.
- No what are the specials?

45:39.704 --> 45:41.306
We'll just--

45:41.306 --> 45:44.109
- Tell him today he better pop
his peepers back in his head

45:44.109 --> 45:45.410
or I'll pop them for him.

45:45.410 --> 45:47.112
- I'm not gonna
tell him that Gus.

45:52.984 --> 45:56.054
Hi, I'm Amos, can I
get you something?

45:57.555 --> 45:59.390
- Just coffee.
- Me too.

45:59.390 --> 46:01.059
- Two, be right back.

46:01.059 --> 46:02.293
- Sir.
- Yes?

46:04.062 --> 46:05.763
- How is he today?

46:05.763 --> 46:06.597
Gus right?

46:08.533 --> 46:09.567
- You know Gus?

46:10.902 --> 46:12.403
- Well--

46:12.403 --> 46:15.040
- Joe's made him somewhat
famous in our writing class.

46:15.040 --> 46:17.375
- Oh, oh yeah the writing class.

46:19.210 --> 46:20.678
You're writing about Gus.

46:21.913 --> 46:23.148
- The guy's a solid study,

46:23.148 --> 46:25.383
I couldn't make
him up if I tried.

46:25.383 --> 46:27.285
And I had to prove it.

46:27.285 --> 46:28.486
- Really?

46:28.486 --> 46:30.655
Well now you watch
him at your own risk,

46:30.655 --> 46:34.425
but, but hey you know, Francis

46:34.425 --> 46:37.695
she is on the waiting list
for that very class you're in.

46:37.695 --> 46:40.298
- Well it is a great class.
- That's what I hear.

46:41.499 --> 46:43.234
I'll be right back
with your coffees.

46:45.403 --> 46:47.238
They're fans alright.
- What?

46:49.574 --> 46:51.809
This ain't a zoo
and I ain't a llama.

46:52.810 --> 46:54.946
- Told you.
- Classic.

46:54.946 --> 46:56.114
- What're you writing?

46:58.249 --> 47:00.385
- Just your tales of wisdom.

47:01.719 --> 47:02.854
- You making fun of me?

47:03.754 --> 47:05.356
- Oh no, no no no.

47:05.356 --> 47:06.757
- No?

47:06.757 --> 47:09.194
I'm serious, I ain't
for writing about.

47:10.528 --> 47:11.362
Well,

47:13.098 --> 47:14.933
I just won't do
anything interesting.

47:16.067 --> 47:19.770
- That seems like a
big stretch.

47:22.073 --> 47:24.042
- Francis.
- Yeah?

47:24.042 --> 47:25.010
- Come here.
- What did he say?

47:25.010 --> 47:26.411
What did he say?

47:26.411 --> 47:28.013
- Never mind what he said, look,

47:29.280 --> 47:31.482
you've gotta give
this guy your story

47:31.482 --> 47:33.318
because he's an
assistant professor,

47:33.318 --> 47:35.186
he's gotta have some kind
of pull, he could help you.

47:35.186 --> 47:37.222
- I don't know, I
just, I can't Amos.

47:37.222 --> 47:38.689
- You gotta take
this opportunity,

47:38.689 --> 47:39.690
it's knocking on the door.

47:39.690 --> 47:40.926
You gotta open the door

47:40.926 --> 47:42.260
'cause in a minute Gus
is gonna scare them away

47:42.260 --> 47:43.494
and they'll be gone forever.

47:43.494 --> 47:45.130
Now turn around and go, go.
- No Amos.

47:45.130 --> 47:46.697
- I'll go with you.
- Oh Amos.

47:53.004 --> 47:53.905
- This is Francis.

47:55.406 --> 47:58.043
- Coffees and place mats.

48:00.445 --> 48:01.246
Cream?

48:02.113 --> 48:04.049
- We're good.
- Okay.

48:08.319 --> 48:09.687
Sir.
- Yeah?

48:12.457 --> 48:13.291
- Hi.

48:14.292 --> 48:17.362
I'd like to--
- I'm Joe.

48:17.362 --> 48:19.730
- Hi I'm Francis.

48:22.033 --> 48:23.768
- What's up Francis?

48:23.768 --> 48:26.271
- I wanted to talk to you.

48:26.271 --> 48:29.274
The thing is I was wondering
if you just might be,

48:29.274 --> 48:31.542
if you might be willing,

48:31.542 --> 48:34.045
you see I'm on the waiting
list for that class

48:34.045 --> 48:35.680
and I thought maybe
you'd be willing

48:35.680 --> 48:38.683
to take a look at this
story I've been working on.

48:38.683 --> 48:40.385
I mean if you're too busy
or whatever that's fine,

48:40.385 --> 48:44.155
but if you can and
you think it's good

48:44.155 --> 48:46.791
maybe you could talk to
Mr. Duvet about me being--

48:46.791 --> 48:48.526
- Francis, let me
just stop you there

48:48.526 --> 48:51.129
'cause Joe, he
really can't do that,

48:51.129 --> 48:54.099
even if he wanted to, so sorry.

48:55.566 --> 48:56.968
- That's fine.

48:56.968 --> 49:00.205
- It's just that you
know I'm just a student.

49:00.205 --> 49:01.706
- No, no, it's not a problem,

49:01.706 --> 49:04.709
I just thought that maybe you
know you could, but really--

49:04.709 --> 49:05.810
- It's not that,
it's just that--

49:05.810 --> 49:08.746
- No it's fine, I understand.

49:08.746 --> 49:10.681
Now I've got this thing so.

49:12.217 --> 49:14.052
- Well sorry.

49:15.486 --> 49:19.857
- Well you be sure to let me
know if you need anything else.

49:27.732 --> 49:29.000

I suspect we have
some chatting to do.

50:51.716 --> 50:52.517
Scooch on over would you?
- Okay.

50:55.520 --> 51:00.458
- Now, your mama, she ever
make you set the table?

51:03.128 --> 51:03.961
- Yes.

51:05.830 --> 51:07.932
Most every night.

51:07.932 --> 51:11.269
She's picky like that.
- Picky like what?

51:12.170 --> 51:13.003
- Oh well,

51:15.473 --> 51:18.976
she says if you're
not sick or deceased

51:18.976 --> 51:21.779
you better be
sitting at that table

51:21.779 --> 51:24.349
even if it's take out
on New Year's Eve.

51:24.349 --> 51:26.050
And then she asks us questions.

51:27.485 --> 51:29.387
- Sounds like your mama
knows what a table's for.

51:29.387 --> 51:31.289
What kind of questions?

51:32.723 --> 51:36.927
- You know, normal questions
like how was your day?

51:36.927 --> 51:39.430
What was good, what was bad,

51:39.430 --> 51:43.234
but she calls those
roses and thorns,

51:43.234 --> 51:44.335
it's like the good is the roses

51:44.335 --> 51:46.471
and the bad is the thorns.

51:46.471 --> 51:48.639
And then she makes
you ask your own.

51:50.341 --> 51:51.142
- Okay.

51:52.377 --> 51:53.178
Shoot.

51:54.845 --> 51:56.080
- What?

51:56.080 --> 51:59.184
- Well seems to
me, pretty obvious,

51:59.184 --> 52:02.086
that you came here
looking for some.

52:04.855 --> 52:07.024
- It's that obvious isn't it?

52:07.024 --> 52:09.860
- Why don't you start
with the thorn first,

52:09.860 --> 52:14.165
the real prickly one, the one
poking a hole in your soul.

52:14.165 --> 52:14.999
- Okay.

52:16.534 --> 52:20.971
1977, April 20th did you
give birth to a child,

52:22.340 --> 52:26.043
specifically a boy and
then did you give him away?

52:29.547 --> 52:32.317
- Feels good to ask
something true don't it

52:32.317 --> 52:34.219
even if it is thorny.

52:34.219 --> 52:35.253
- Yes it does.

52:38.389 --> 52:42.293
- No son I did not
have a baby in 1977.

52:43.661 --> 52:47.031
I gave birth to my
son eight years ago.

52:47.031 --> 52:50.067
- You named him Jackson?
- I did.

52:50.067 --> 52:51.969
That's my maiden name.

52:51.969 --> 52:53.304
I didn't have a brother so.

52:55.573 --> 52:56.374
- I see.

52:58.509 --> 52:59.344
- I'm sorry.

53:02.146 --> 53:03.448
- What about her?

53:05.015 --> 53:06.884
You know anything about her?

53:06.884 --> 53:07.885
- Hey order up.

53:09.086 --> 53:11.889
Look, soy sauce, am
I good or am I good?

53:14.792 --> 53:16.727
- Wait, when did she
start coming here?

53:17.895 --> 53:19.530
- Let me get your
order okay son?

53:19.530 --> 53:20.365
- Ma'am.

53:25.002 --> 53:27.405
Ma'am, ma'am please.

53:27.405 --> 53:29.940
Please, when did she
start coming here?

53:29.940 --> 53:31.175
- It just wouldn't be right

53:31.175 --> 53:33.711
to tell somebody else's
story you understand?

53:33.711 --> 53:35.380
- So she's got
something to hide.

53:36.547 --> 53:38.115
- Maybe it's no one's business.

53:39.784 --> 53:42.019
- I think it's my business.

58:40.517 --> 58:41.586
- Can you speak up?

58:43.087 --> 58:48.092
- Okay, I was
wondering if I could...

58:50.961 --> 58:52.797
I just--
- Hey.

58:52.797 --> 58:54.031
Careful son, you don't just

58:54.031 --> 58:56.266
go around touching
people's stuff.

58:56.266 --> 58:58.569
- No I wasn't, I'm
sorry I was just,

58:58.569 --> 59:01.338
I want to ask you
a couple questions.

59:03.440 --> 59:05.442
- I don't turn off
the songs for nobody.

59:11.081 --> 59:12.049
- I'm not a nobody.

59:15.352 --> 59:16.186
I'm your son.

59:19.089 --> 59:21.525
You know it and I know it.

59:21.525 --> 59:23.661
- What?
- I can tell.

59:24.729 --> 59:26.430
The way they all treat you.

59:26.430 --> 59:27.765
You've come here for years.

59:29.033 --> 59:31.368
You're the only one
that makes sense.

59:31.368 --> 59:32.970
I've been through everyone else.

59:35.405 --> 59:37.007
I'm Jack.

59:38.208 --> 59:39.844
Jack!

59:39.844 --> 59:41.145
I'm Jack!

59:42.112 --> 59:45.983
Oh, what a shocker, huh?

59:45.983 --> 59:48.919
That I found you
after all these years.

59:48.919 --> 59:53.057
Well maybe if you hadn't
of just tossed me away.

59:53.057 --> 59:57.594
If you could've taken a second
out of your embarrassing life

59:57.594 --> 01:00:00.030
to just find a way to love me

01:00:01.198 --> 01:00:02.599
maybe you wouldn't
be like you are

01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:08.038
and maybe, maybe I
wouldn't be standing here

01:00:08.038 --> 01:00:09.674
yelling at my real mother

01:00:09.674 --> 01:00:13.277
in the middle of The Griddle
House on New Year's Eve.

01:00:13.277 --> 01:00:14.544
- Jack.
- No!

01:00:14.544 --> 01:00:16.947
- Jack, calm down.

01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:19.817
This isn't the time
or the place okay?

01:00:19.817 --> 01:00:20.951
Calm down.

01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:23.420
- Tiny, he don't mean it.

01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:24.955
- Oh no.

01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:26.190
Right there's where
you're sideways Gus

01:00:26.190 --> 01:00:29.794
because you know
what he means it.

01:00:31.361 --> 01:00:32.930
Just look at him,
look at his face

01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:36.667
and you can see how
terrible much he means it.

01:00:36.667 --> 01:00:39.169
Right down to the bone
he means it, every word.

01:00:41.071 --> 01:00:43.007
And the crazy thing
is that he's right.

01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:48.879
About how I lived,
what I've done.

01:00:51.215 --> 01:00:52.750
He's right about all of it

01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:57.722
except for one little
thing, I'm not his mama.

01:00:59.456 --> 01:01:00.958
I've never had a baby of my own.

01:01:03.393 --> 01:01:05.329
- Tiny wait I wanted
to give you something

01:01:05.329 --> 01:01:07.131
for your birthday at midnight,

01:01:07.131 --> 01:01:08.298
but I can give it to you now.

01:01:08.298 --> 01:01:10.968
- Can't stop.
- Tiny your car's broke.

01:01:21.045 --> 01:01:21.879
- Come on.

01:01:27.985 --> 01:01:30.120
- So it was none of them?

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.989
Great job on your
terrible story.

01:01:31.989 --> 01:01:33.090
- Oh it gets better.

01:02:25.409 --> 01:02:30.414
Oh I didn't know you were
waiting, but you can--

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:32.850
- I wasn't, not
for the bathroom.

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.354
That was awkward.

01:02:39.023 --> 01:02:39.857
- What?

01:02:41.258 --> 01:02:45.729
- Think of the most awful thing
that happened tonight, that.

01:02:48.198 --> 01:02:50.167
- Yeah, I know.

01:02:50.167 --> 01:02:52.069
- Things must be
pretty rough at home?

01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:55.239
- They're not great.

01:02:55.239 --> 01:02:56.440
- Terrible parents?

01:02:58.075 --> 01:02:59.043
- Not great.

01:02:59.043 --> 01:03:01.979
- Don't love you, resent you,

01:03:01.979 --> 01:03:04.548
wish you were out
of their lives?

01:03:04.548 --> 01:03:05.549
Something like that?

01:03:06.884 --> 01:03:07.717
- No, no.

01:03:09.686 --> 01:03:13.390
You know, we don't
connect lately so.

01:03:14.992 --> 01:03:16.927
- You don't connect.

01:03:16.927 --> 01:03:18.128
You thought you would connect

01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:20.597
with a total stranger
in a coffee shop?

01:03:20.597 --> 01:03:21.832
- What?

01:03:21.832 --> 01:03:24.301
What are you trying
to understand me?

01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:25.735
Trying to like figure me out?

01:03:30.407 --> 01:03:33.110
- People don't get to
pick their family son.

01:03:35.112 --> 01:03:36.513
Except sometimes they do.

01:03:37.681 --> 01:03:41.618
I just, I feel like that
should mean something.

01:03:44.521 --> 01:03:45.355
- Thank you.

01:04:02.907 --> 01:04:03.740
- Oh hey hon.

01:04:07.077 --> 01:04:11.215
Listen Tiny's a big girl,
she makes her own decisions.

01:04:12.316 --> 01:04:14.518
It ain't all on you, okay?

01:04:18.989 --> 01:04:22.492
- Listen, just don't
read that story okay--

01:04:22.492 --> 01:04:23.660
- We already did.

01:04:24.594 --> 01:04:25.562
- Oh.
- It's great.

01:04:25.562 --> 01:04:28.132
- Yeah it's really beautiful.

01:04:28.132 --> 01:04:31.068
- Well I'm sure it needs a
lot of work so please just--

01:04:31.068 --> 01:04:32.736
- Not that I saw.

01:04:32.736 --> 01:04:36.240
Look I'll definitely
talk to Duvet for you,

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:39.643
but we're actually interested
in your story ourselves.

01:04:39.643 --> 01:04:41.912
You see we just launched
a writing magazine

01:04:41.912 --> 01:04:44.681
where basically new writers
can submit their stuff

01:04:44.681 --> 01:04:47.217
and we're convinced that
there's a whole book here.

01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:50.120
- I just, I don't really
know what to say so.

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:52.589
- Yes will do.
- How about maybe?

01:04:52.589 --> 01:04:53.823
- What?

01:04:53.823 --> 01:04:55.092
- It's just not
my story to tell.

01:04:56.026 --> 01:04:57.861
I've gotta run it by someone.

01:04:57.861 --> 01:04:59.829
- Well any idea when you'll
have an answer for us?

01:04:59.829 --> 01:05:02.699
- That's fine, listen,
I'll leave my contact info

01:05:02.699 --> 01:05:05.069
and just whenever,
if ever feels right,

01:05:05.069 --> 01:05:06.303
just give me a call--

01:05:06.303 --> 01:05:08.338
- You know what I'm
sorry I've got to go.

01:05:08.338 --> 01:05:12.276
- I think this should
probably cover it.

01:05:12.276 --> 01:05:14.544
- Goodness, you didn't
get the filet mignon.

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:17.514
Take it, save it for yourself.

01:05:19.416 --> 01:05:20.417
- Thank you.

01:05:36.166 --> 01:05:37.167
Hey.

01:05:37.167 --> 01:05:38.002
- Hey.

01:05:38.002 --> 01:05:39.736
- You like my car?

01:05:39.736 --> 01:05:41.405
- Are you
going somewhere?

01:05:42.539 --> 01:05:45.475
- Yeah, after all that
I think it's just,

01:05:45.475 --> 01:05:46.876
you know, best if I head on.

01:05:48.012 --> 01:05:50.347
- You know sometimes
in life we just,

01:05:50.347 --> 01:05:52.349
we don't have any
choice but to move on.

01:05:54.184 --> 01:05:55.419
- Right.

01:05:55.419 --> 01:05:58.422
- Hey, did you find what
you were looking for?

01:06:01.558 --> 01:06:02.359
- No.

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:06.596
But I sure made a fool
of myself trying to.

01:06:06.596 --> 01:06:08.565
- No, no you didn't, no.

01:06:10.067 --> 01:06:14.471
I mean Phil, sometimes
the only choice we have

01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:18.408
is to just give up
the search you know?

01:06:19.409 --> 01:06:20.244
- Yeah.

01:06:21.678 --> 01:06:25.282
By the way my name isn't
actually Phil, it's Jack.

01:06:27.651 --> 01:06:30.754
I mean I yelled it
pretty loud in there so.

01:06:30.754 --> 01:06:31.721
- Yeah I know.

01:06:33.290 --> 01:06:34.124
I know.

01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:42.599
You know what nevermind.

01:06:42.599 --> 01:06:45.035
Just, Happy New Year.

01:06:47.137 --> 01:06:49.706
And I want you to
drive safe okay.

01:06:49.706 --> 01:06:53.343
- Yeah, thanks, Happy New Year.

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:05.609
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:09:06.776 --> 01:09:08.978
- I'm gonna go, so.

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:10.747
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:10:23.353 --> 01:10:25.522
- Amos get me all
the marshmallows you got.

01:10:25.522 --> 01:10:27.624
- Looks like somebody's
done beat you to it.

01:10:33.663 --> 01:10:34.764
- Jack what?

01:10:35.632 --> 01:10:36.633
- Where's Francis?

01:10:38.201 --> 01:10:39.769
- Well her shift was over honey.

01:10:41.938 --> 01:10:42.939
- Are you serious?

01:10:46.075 --> 01:10:46.876
She's gone.

01:10:49.145 --> 01:10:52.682
So what, she wrote
that whole story,

01:10:52.682 --> 01:10:57.654
snuck it into my car
like that, she's gone?

01:10:58.855 --> 01:11:00.089
She didn't even want
to say goodbye to me.

01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:01.257
- Come have a seat
with me, okay?

01:11:08.064 --> 01:11:13.069
Hey, her sharing that story
with you, that was big for her.

01:11:15.872 --> 01:11:20.877
- All I ever wanted I thought
was to meet my birth mom.

01:11:24.748 --> 01:11:27.351
Stupid, just so stupid.

01:11:27.351 --> 01:11:29.586
- If you allow me to say so

01:11:30.787 --> 01:11:32.989
I believe you did get
to meet your birth mom

01:11:32.989 --> 01:11:34.891
at least just a little bit.

01:11:34.891 --> 01:11:39.896
The time you spent here, the
story that she shared with you,

01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:43.600
that is her truest self

01:11:45.068 --> 01:11:48.104
and she did say
goodbye in her own way.

01:11:51.841 --> 01:11:54.744
She said that she'd never
have the perfect words

01:11:54.744 --> 01:11:57.080
so she wrote them instead.

01:12:07.256 --> 01:12:12.261
- For the boy who is already
the oak inside the acorn.

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:18.067
What does that mean?

01:12:18.067 --> 01:12:19.903
- I think what
she's trying to say

01:12:20.770 --> 01:12:23.707
is that she already sees in you

01:12:23.707 --> 01:12:25.274
everything you're going to be.

01:12:26.443 --> 01:12:29.245
That she wanted you to
be, you already are.

01:12:31.214 --> 01:12:32.048
You see?

01:12:37.153 --> 01:12:38.187
- Just one thing.

01:12:39.456 --> 01:12:44.461
When I first read this letter

01:12:46.095 --> 01:12:48.965
she said that she'd been
coming to The Griddle House

01:12:48.965 --> 01:12:51.435
for years but when I asked her

01:12:51.435 --> 01:12:54.370
she said she only worked
here for three weeks.

01:12:56.372 --> 01:12:59.709
- Both, she's been
here for years

01:12:59.709 --> 01:13:01.945
and has only been working
here for a few weeks.

01:13:05.449 --> 01:13:07.851
I got something for
you, one second.

01:13:12.255 --> 01:13:16.092
When I got the blues
I play the crosswords.

01:13:17.193 --> 01:13:18.695
And I'm gonna share
that with you.

01:13:21.164 --> 01:13:22.699
Can you help me with four down?

01:13:26.670 --> 01:13:28.137
- Could be punk.

01:13:31.641 --> 01:13:33.209
- Excuse me.

01:13:33.209 --> 01:13:34.310
- Sorry, sorry.

01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:37.180
Give me the poundy, smashy now.

01:13:38.114 --> 01:13:39.649
Thank you.

01:13:39.649 --> 01:13:43.453
Alright give me the one that
goes--

01:13:43.453 --> 01:13:44.287
Thank you.

01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:47.423
I think that...

01:13:52.228 --> 01:13:53.530
She's fixed.

01:13:53.530 --> 01:13:54.330
- Really?

01:13:54.330 --> 01:13:55.565
- Yep, great.

01:13:55.565 --> 01:13:56.766
Now here we land
on the signature,

01:13:56.766 --> 01:13:58.034
can we get the
owner's signature?

01:13:58.034 --> 01:14:00.003
- Oh, oh, yeah,
yeah.

01:14:00.003 --> 01:14:00.870
Mr. Peterson.

01:14:02.005 --> 01:14:03.773
The twin towers
need your signature.

01:14:03.773 --> 01:14:04.608
- Sure thing.

01:14:05.875 --> 01:14:07.477
- No way.

01:14:09.913 --> 01:14:11.147
- Alright.
- Thank you gentlemen.

01:14:11.147 --> 01:14:13.850
- Oh our pleasure, she
is a lovely machine.

01:14:13.850 --> 01:14:15.084
- Thank you very much.

01:14:15.084 --> 01:14:16.285
- I was wondering if we
could get some menus.

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:17.386
I think we're gonna
stay for dinner.

01:14:17.386 --> 01:14:19.055
- Absolutely.
- Great.

01:14:19.055 --> 01:14:21.357
- On the house.
- Why thank you.

01:14:23.326 --> 01:14:26.062
- Dude, come on.

01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:28.965
You're the owner?

01:14:28.965 --> 01:14:31.167
- No one really owns anything,

01:14:31.167 --> 01:14:33.169
but this place was
entrusted to me.

01:14:33.169 --> 01:14:35.705
- Whatever, you
paid their checks

01:14:35.705 --> 01:14:37.874
and you're the one
cleaning up the messes?

01:14:37.874 --> 01:14:39.075
- Yeah.

01:14:39.075 --> 01:14:40.476
I really don't mind.

01:14:40.476 --> 01:14:43.446
- Dude if I were you I wouldn't
even be here right now.

01:14:43.446 --> 01:14:46.750
I'd be at home, kicking back,

01:14:46.750 --> 01:14:50.520
watching a big screen
TV and counting my cash.

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:52.488
- I don't do this for the money.

01:14:52.488 --> 01:14:53.723
- What?

01:14:53.723 --> 01:14:56.526
- You can't trust
money or things.

01:14:57.927 --> 01:15:01.631
- Well, that's about
all I do trust.

01:15:03.099 --> 01:15:05.702
- And that's why you're the
only one here in handcuffs.

01:15:07.103 --> 01:15:11.074
You really want to be free
follow what's in here.

01:15:24.788 --> 01:15:25.855
- Well what do you know

01:15:25.855 --> 01:15:28.992
it's Officer Darcy just in time.

01:15:28.992 --> 01:15:29.959
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

01:15:30.827 --> 01:15:32.596
- Mason is it true?

01:15:32.596 --> 01:15:35.398
Did you steal a Sega
Genetics from the Target?

01:15:35.398 --> 01:15:36.600
- Genesis.

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:38.735
- A Sega Genesis
from the Target?

01:15:38.735 --> 01:15:43.439
- Yes ma'am but
it's just Target.

01:15:43.439 --> 01:15:45.041
- Mason why?

01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:46.309
- I don't know.

01:15:46.309 --> 01:15:48.211
- Don't we give you
everything you need?

01:15:52.916 --> 01:15:55.384
Needless to say I am
very disappointed in you.

01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:57.787
Your father is gonna
be beside himself.

01:15:57.787 --> 01:15:58.622
- I know.

01:15:59.756 --> 01:16:01.691
- What am I gonna do with you?

01:16:01.691 --> 01:16:03.627
- Maybe he could
stay here with us.

01:16:03.627 --> 01:16:06.162
- Oh I don't know.

01:16:06.162 --> 01:16:08.064
- You want him to
straighten out?

01:16:08.064 --> 01:16:09.766
I can't imagine a better place.

01:16:11.768 --> 01:16:15.171
- Well thank you,
I'll be in touch.

01:16:15.171 --> 01:16:15.972
Come on Mason.

01:16:29.485 --> 01:16:30.453
Thank you Officer.

01:16:32.088 --> 01:16:34.658
- Would the
hero like a cup of Joe?

01:16:34.658 --> 01:16:36.525
- Yeah, I'll hang out.

01:16:46.903 --> 01:16:47.737
- Hey.

01:16:49.505 --> 01:16:51.107
- There you are Tiny.

01:16:52.575 --> 01:16:57.013
- Please don't, I mean do,
but just give me a minute.

01:16:59.983 --> 01:17:02.351
Now you y'all,
y'all bear with me.

01:17:02.351 --> 01:17:06.489
Someone once told
me that the truth

01:17:06.489 --> 01:17:07.791
will make your voice shake

01:17:09.192 --> 01:17:13.496
and it'll gut you too sometimes
to hear all that point blank

01:17:13.496 --> 01:17:17.333
but that ain't the worse that
can happen to someone like me

01:17:17.333 --> 01:17:20.670
to hear something so hard and
ugly and true about yourself

01:17:20.670 --> 01:17:24.373
that you can't help but you
know run into it head long.

01:17:25.574 --> 01:17:26.710
That ain't the worst.

01:17:28.544 --> 01:17:33.549
The worst is trolling around
every night of your life

01:17:34.718 --> 01:17:36.085
waiting for a pick up
and pretending like

01:17:37.386 --> 01:17:39.088
that's the only truth
that there'll ever be

01:17:39.088 --> 01:17:41.324
for you 'cause you're trouble

01:17:42.959 --> 01:17:45.328
and trouble can't
hope for no more.

01:17:45.328 --> 01:17:47.263
- Tiny.
- No.

01:17:47.263 --> 01:17:51.701
No maybe that's what
I'm trying to say here,

01:17:51.701 --> 01:17:55.805
that my truth, no matter
how hard I say it,

01:17:57.106 --> 01:18:00.744
it isn't true, I don't
believe it anymore.

01:18:00.744 --> 01:18:03.646
- You don't?
- Nope.

01:18:03.646 --> 01:18:04.914
What you've been saying to me

01:18:04.914 --> 01:18:06.883
for as long as I've
been coming in here,

01:18:08.217 --> 01:18:11.620
that my heart is worth fighting
for, worth loving even,

01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:15.925
I'm starting to believe it.

01:18:19.328 --> 01:18:20.663
- Anything else?

01:18:22.431 --> 01:18:24.267
- That I ain't no
trouble for anyone.

01:18:25.969 --> 01:18:28.271
- How's that truth feel
when you say it Tiny?

01:18:29.806 --> 01:18:32.308
- Like my heart's
been waiting 34 years

01:18:32.308 --> 01:18:34.077
for my mouth to say it out loud.

01:18:35.478 --> 01:18:38.247
- Feels good right,
like good home cooking.

01:18:43.052 --> 01:18:45.789
- Handlethorpes, you
got a sledgehammer?

01:18:48.958 --> 01:18:49.793
Oh.

01:18:52.228 --> 01:18:53.229
Get it girl.

01:18:58.401 --> 01:18:59.668
- This calls for a toast.

01:19:02.705 --> 01:19:03.639
I almost forgot.

01:19:05.241 --> 01:19:06.742
Mae-Bee you want
to count us down?

01:19:06.742 --> 01:19:09.612
- Okay, goodness is it that
time already, okay here we go.

01:19:09.612 --> 01:19:13.082
10.
- Nine, eight, seven,

01:19:13.082 --> 01:19:17.787
six, five, four,
three, two, one.

01:19:17.787 --> 01:19:19.655
Happy New Year!

01:19:20.857 --> 01:19:22.625
- And happy birthday Tiny.

01:19:22.625 --> 01:19:23.927
- Happy New Year.

01:19:23.927 --> 01:19:25.328
Happy New Year.

01:19:25.328 --> 01:19:27.196
- Okay well.

01:19:27.196 --> 01:19:29.298
You gonna blow out
them candles or what?

01:19:29.298 --> 01:19:33.669
- I want to memorize it
all lit up like that.

01:19:35.071 --> 01:19:36.973
I ain't never had one before.

01:19:36.973 --> 01:19:40.143
- Had a what?
- A birthday cake.

01:19:40.143 --> 01:19:42.478

01:19:46.115 --> 01:19:47.650
- Okay here goes everything.

01:19:52.588 --> 01:19:55.691

01:19:55.691 --> 01:19:57.793
- That's from both of us.
- Yeah.

01:19:59.262 --> 01:20:00.463
We know it will fit your car

01:20:00.463 --> 01:20:02.631

we got it from.

01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:04.800
- Thank you.
- Happy New Year.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:08.171
- This is the awesomest
New Year's ever

01:20:08.171 --> 01:20:11.040
because we've all
become a family.

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:13.576
- Hey.
- Happy New Year.

01:20:13.576 --> 01:20:14.643

01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:15.979
- Alright some hats.

01:20:15.979 --> 01:20:18.081
A blue one for the man in blue.

01:20:18.081 --> 01:20:19.548
- Need blue, you do?

01:20:19.548 --> 01:20:23.019
Okay.

01:20:23.019 --> 01:20:24.487

01:20:31.928 --> 01:20:33.496
- What happens next?

01:20:33.496 --> 01:20:34.730
Mom saves the day.

01:20:40.970 --> 01:20:43.472
Mom, Dad, what are
you guys doing?

01:20:43.472 --> 01:20:45.041
- Hey Jack.

01:20:45.041 --> 01:20:46.542
- Oh we've
been worried about you.

01:20:46.542 --> 01:20:48.878
You know you tore out of there
pretty quick this morning.

01:20:48.878 --> 01:20:50.646
- Yeah I know, I was just--

01:20:50.646 --> 01:20:52.115
- Jack, it's okay.

01:20:55.784 --> 01:20:58.321
- Do you guys want some cake?
- You bet.

01:21:00.756 --> 01:21:01.757
- This is my booth.

01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:05.528
- You first.
- Thanks.

01:21:09.498 --> 01:21:11.500
- Howdy.

01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:13.302
Here you go.

01:21:13.302 --> 01:21:16.339
Can I get you some
hot coffee or cocoa

01:21:16.339 --> 01:21:17.440
to go with the cake?

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:19.475
- I'll take some coffee.
- Okay.

01:21:19.475 --> 01:21:20.709
- Actually I was wondering
if you had some--

01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:23.112
- Skim milk with a
side bowl of lemon?

01:21:23.112 --> 01:21:25.982
- Yeah, that's amazing.
- I know.

01:21:25.982 --> 01:21:28.651
- We really enjoyed having
your son here with us

01:21:28.651 --> 01:21:32.421
and we hope you make a habit
of stopping in on the regular.

01:21:32.421 --> 01:21:34.790
I'll go get your drinks.
- Thank you.

01:21:36.559 --> 01:21:38.427
- So who called you?

01:21:39.428 --> 01:21:40.529
- Francis.

01:21:42.331 --> 01:21:45.001
Did you get to meet her?

01:21:45.001 --> 01:21:46.569
- Kind of.

01:21:46.569 --> 01:21:48.371
- Did you find what
you were looking for?

01:21:49.372 --> 01:21:50.173
- Yeah.

01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:51.941
- You okay?

01:21:52.976 --> 01:21:54.577
- Yeah.

01:21:59.748 --> 01:22:01.717
- Oh my gosh dude.

01:22:10.226 --> 01:22:12.128
You know that was a
really good story.

01:22:13.396 --> 01:22:14.763
Thanks again for your help.

01:22:15.631 --> 01:22:16.465
- No problem.

01:22:18.834 --> 01:22:19.835
- So you think

01:22:19.835 --> 01:22:21.137

01:22:22.338 --> 01:22:23.706
- Somebody always is.

01:22:25.741 --> 01:22:28.711

out you'll find it in there.

01:22:33.916 --> 01:22:34.883
