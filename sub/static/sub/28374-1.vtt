      He's agreed to help
      me with something.

11:59.753 --> 12:00.985
      Sweet dreams, Max.

12:00.987 --> 12:03.922
      (foreboding music)

12:05.425 --> 12:08.393
      (thunder rumbling)

12:09.496 --> 12:10.462
      You did good today.

12:10.464 --> 12:12.130
        I'm proud of ya.

12:12.132 --> 12:13.131
    I want you to have this.

12:13.133 --> 12:16.367
     (cheerful surf music)

12:18.271 --> 12:19.437
         - Thank you.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.306
      - [Edmund] Open it.

12:24.144 --> 12:25.276
     ¶ Beach beach beach ¶

12:25.278 --> 12:26.377
    - [Edmund] You like it?

12:27.481 --> 12:29.214
     It's a uniform your
     mother used to wear.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.117
          Try it on.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.885
     ¶ Beach beach beach ¶

12:33.887 --> 12:35.286
        ¶ Na na wa wa ¶

12:35.288 --> 12:38.490
  ¶ Beach beach sha na na ¶

12:40.026 --> 12:41.760
    - [Charlotte Voiceover]
  Dad used to be a detective.

12:42.829 --> 12:45.130
For a while after the accident

12:45.132 --> 12:47.065
      he was convinced he
    could find mum's killer.

12:47.067 --> 12:49.000
     ¶ Beach beach beach ¶

12:49.002 --> 12:50.535
        ¶ Na na wa wa ¶

12:50.537 --> 12:52.203
        ¶ Beach beach ¶

12:52.205 --> 12:54.305
- [Charlotte Voiceover] Nobody
   took much notice though.

12:56.176 --> 12:58.376
    Part of dad seemed angry
     that Max had found him

12:58.378 --> 13:00.278
       rather than the
      other way around.

13:02.015 --> 13:03.448
       - Do you want me
      to clean the house?

13:03.450 --> 13:05.817
  - [Edmund] No, I want you
   to create a character.

13:05.819 --> 13:07.452
    - [Charlotte Voiceover]
    Another part was excited

13:07.454 --> 13:08.353
         to meet him.

13:10.357 --> 13:12.957
    By the end of it they
  both agreed on something.

13:15.195 --> 13:17.295
    I got that feeling she
    was watching me again.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.097
    - [Edmund] If someone
  wore that kind of uniform

13:19.099 --> 13:21.166
  and had that kind of hair,

13:21.168 --> 13:23.401
      what kind of person
        might they be?

13:23.403 --> 13:26.271
        (creepy music)

13:27.207 --> 13:30.375
     - Maybe someone who's
      hard on their luck.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.179
      Too many children.

13:36.216 --> 13:37.916
 Definitely a broken marriage.

13:39.553 --> 13:41.019
        She'd smoke too.

13:41.021 --> 13:43.454
        (veiled music)

13:45.258 --> 13:46.958
    Maybe she'd be French.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.127
      - [Edmund] (laughs)
     No, she's not French.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.061
          - Bonjour.

13:50.063 --> 13:51.362
- Charlotte, she's not French.

13:52.399 --> 13:55.333
      But she also knows
      all about plumbing.

13:57.404 --> 13:59.370
            ¶ Oh ¶

14:00.473 --> 14:01.472
          - Plumbing?

14:03.343 --> 14:05.009
 - [Woman On TV] That's right.

14:05.011 --> 14:07.979
   All you need to do is use
 your extrasensory perception,

14:07.981 --> 14:10.415
     and you and a friend
     could be spending...

14:10.417 --> 14:13.351
        (puzzled music)

14:16.489 --> 14:18.523
     - Put this on in case
       someone sees you.

14:19.426 --> 14:21.426
  And don't speak to anyone.

14:21.428 --> 14:24.429
  (woman chattering on radio)

14:24.431 --> 14:27.365
        (curious music)

14:33.340 --> 14:34.906
    - You must be Charlotte.

14:34.908 --> 14:35.640
         Oh! (laughs)

14:35.642 --> 14:37.308
    Took me about two hours,

14:37.310 --> 14:39.510
  but I found the stuff your
    old man's looking for.

14:40.447 --> 14:43.081
     Records from January
     12th six years ago.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.050
       They're the only
     ones that booked in.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.392
    - [Charlotte Voiceover]
     I'd only ever stayed

14:54.394 --> 14:55.426
        in a motel once.

14:56.329 --> 14:57.428
          I was 11.

14:59.032 --> 15:01.099
      I remember a boy in
      the room next door.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.535
      He told me the sun
       made him blind.

15:06.206 --> 15:07.171
      - Which one is it?

15:08.675 --> 15:10.541
       - It's that one
     there, the blue one.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.112
    - [Charlotte Voiceover]
        During the day

15:14.114 --> 15:15.346
    he couldn't see at all.

15:19.119 --> 15:21.085
     In the dark he could
       see like normal.

15:22.522 --> 15:23.421
    (knocking on the door)

15:23.423 --> 15:26.024
          (odd music)

15:27.494 --> 15:29.060
    Called himself Dracula.

15:32.632 --> 15:33.998
        (phone ringing)

15:34.000 --> 15:35.566
     Because he got up to
     bad stuff at night.

15:36.970 --> 15:37.602
        - Joe speaking.

15:37.604 --> 15:38.937
        - Good day, Joe.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.204
        I'm gonna cut
    straight to the chase.

15:40.206 --> 15:41.506
    My name's Edmund Bloom.

15:41.508 --> 15:42.941
     You ever heard of me?

15:42.943 --> 15:43.675
      - [Joe] Uh, yeah.
       (woman moaning)

15:43.677 --> 15:46.311
  Nice on top, broken spine.

15:46.313 --> 15:47.479
     You've got a whisper?

15:47.480 --> 15:48.646
      - [Edmund] Aw, Joe,
     that's a bit hurtful.

15:48.648 --> 15:51.115
      Now I need someone
     to run a story for me

15:51.117 --> 15:53.117
 and who won't call me crazy.

15:53.119 --> 15:54.018
        - No promises.

15:54.020 --> 15:57.455
     (pleasurable moaning)

15:57.457 --> 15:59.223
      I had this dream
      a few nights ago.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.226
 I know this sounds nuts, but

16:03.697 --> 16:04.595
         bear with me.

16:07.367 --> 16:10.168
    - [Charlotte Voiceover]
  Living by the ocean is nice

16:10.170 --> 16:12.203
      if you can get used
       to all the rust.

16:12.205 --> 16:14.472
        (woman moaning)

16:14.474 --> 16:17.241
         (weird music)

16:20.313 --> 16:21.980
Even when things wash up dead,

16:22.682 --> 16:25.450
     it still looks right.

16:25.452 --> 16:28.186
   Like the sea has gently
  placed them on the shore.

16:28.188 --> 16:31.255
      (fantastical music)

16:32.392 --> 16:34.192
  Inland is mostly roadkill.

16:35.195 --> 16:36.127
      That's different.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.366
They look the way they should.

16:41.368 --> 16:42.734
     (pleasurable moaning)

16:42.736 --> 16:44.469
  Like they died painfully.

16:44.471 --> 16:47.271
  (woman gasping and moaning)

16:47.273 --> 16:50.074
        (mystical music)

16:51.544 --> 16:53.011
  - What are you doing here?

16:53.013 --> 16:54.579
      I told you not to
      be seen by anyone!

16:55.415 --> 16:57.081
      Where's your hat?

16:57.083 --> 16:58.583
 - I just left it in the car.

16:58.585 --> 17:01.152
I'm just seeing if you're okay.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.353
- [Charlotte] It doesn't matter,

17:02.355 --> 17:03.554
     you did exactly what
     I told you not to do.

17:04.590 --> 17:05.623
- I was worried about the plan.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.159
          (slapping)

17:09.529 --> 17:11.429
  - That's for talking back.

17:11.431 --> 17:13.498
     And from now on you
     do what you're told.

17:14.733 --> 17:16.733
          (slamming)

17:16.736 --> 17:19.537
- [Charlotte Voiceover] I guess
  most things die painfully.

17:20.607 --> 17:22.607
 It doesn't seem fair that the
  last few minutes you've got

17:22.608 --> 17:26.377
  are probably filled with
  terror, pain, or sadness.

17:26.378 --> 17:29.614
     ("Follow Me" by Batz)

17:33.453 --> 17:34.452
You go through your whole life

17:34.454 --> 17:36.621
trying to avoid those feelings.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.825
     Then suddenly there's
    a bullet in your chest.

17:42.362 --> 17:43.661
 Or you're being eaten alive.

17:49.069 --> 17:50.252
        - It says that

17:50.253 --> 17:51.436
   two people checked in the
       Shacks that night.

17:51.438 --> 17:52.703
 Steve Linder and Jesse Atlas.

17:52.705 --> 17:54.405
 Your name's not even on here!

17:56.810 --> 17:58.242
             - Oh.

17:58.244 --> 18:00.278
     I wasn't gonna check
    in under my real name.

18:01.347 --> 18:02.747
       I booked in under
     the name Jesse Atlas.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.516
  I just took it from that
  day's newspaper headline.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.420
      - [Charlotte] What
      was the headline?

18:09.422 --> 18:11.656
     - [Max] Some kind of
    tragedy from that day.

18:13.159 --> 18:15.293
  Maybe a boat accident or--

18:15.295 --> 18:16.494
        - Shark attack.

18:16.496 --> 18:19.397

        (fan rattling)

18:50.897 --> 18:52.663
      Dad wanted me to
      give this to you.

18:58.371 --> 18:59.270
          It's good.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.574
 - [Edmund Voiceover] Catching
 a criminal can be difficult,

19:03.576 --> 19:05.543
  but it's never impressive.

19:05.545 --> 19:06.878
 I mean, who caught Ted Bundy?

19:06.880 --> 19:08.613
      Who caught fucking
       John Wayne Gacy?

19:08.615 --> 19:09.714
      Who gives a shit?

19:09.716 --> 19:11.682
- Hey sweetie, we have a guest.

19:11.684 --> 19:12.817
  Put some coffee in the pot.

19:12.819 --> 19:13.751
     - [Edmund Voiceover]
         Ask any cop.

19:13.753 --> 19:14.752
  You've forgotten in a week.

19:14.754 --> 19:15.753
      - [Edmund] Come in.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.289
     - Detective Sophia--

19:18.291 --> 19:19.357
  - Yeah, I know who you are.

19:20.560 --> 19:21.893
- [Sophia] Inspirational story.

19:21.895 --> 19:23.594
Unfortunate victim standing up

19:23.596 --> 19:24.729
against the lazy incompetent--

19:24.731 --> 19:25.663
- [Edmund] No, you misread it.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.465
  It didn't say standing up.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.600
 - [Sophia] Sorry, rising up.

19:29.602 --> 19:30.434
     - [Edmund Voiceover]
    What you want to catch

19:30.436 --> 19:31.636
    is people's attention.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.605
  A premonition or a vision,

19:34.607 --> 19:35.840
            a dream.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.441
 People listen to that stuff.

19:37.443 --> 19:39.877
    They don't necessarily
 believe it, but they like it.

19:41.281 --> 19:42.246
  - [Charlotte Voiceover] He
   knew there'd be no point

19:42.248 --> 19:43.514
    catching Max on his own.

19:44.751 --> 19:47.685
  People would always sooner
    believe mum over him,

19:47.687 --> 19:49.420
     even if she was dead.

19:49.422 --> 19:50.555
      - [Sophia] Sophia.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.423
    - [Charlotte] Charlotte.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.759
     - Hey, did you enjoy
     the Maritime Festival

19:54.761 --> 19:56.394
        the other night?

19:56.396 --> 19:57.595
            - Sorry?

19:57.597 --> 19:58.930
        - Opening night.

19:58.932 --> 20:01.599
    You were watching the
  fireworks near the docks.

20:01.601 --> 20:04.702
    You were wearing a blue
  cardigan over a pink dress.

20:04.704 --> 20:07.371
     But you had different
     hair, short and dark.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.207
     - No, that wasn't me.

20:09.209 --> 20:10.641
    I stayed home all night.

20:11.744 --> 20:13.878
   - [Edmund Voiceover] Too
 many facts obscure the truth.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.247
      Most cases are so
       fucking boring.

20:16.249 --> 20:18.282
      A confession or a
      witness account.

20:18.284 --> 20:20.685
It's just forgettable bullshit.

20:20.687 --> 20:22.587
People prefer a bit of darkness.

20:24.724 --> 20:27.758
        (ethereal music)

20:30.630 --> 20:32.697
    - [Edmund] You suddenly
     fit the description.

20:34.834 --> 20:35.833
      Wouldn't you agree?

20:38.871 --> 20:39.770
            - Yes.

20:39.772 --> 20:42.840
      (dreamlike music)

20:43.776 --> 20:45.576
     - [Edmund] These are
    your mother's clothes.

20:48.881 --> 20:49.880
          Disgusting.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.785
     So, how do you plead?

20:58.458 --> 20:59.323
          - Guilty.

21:01.027 --> 21:01.993
    - [Edmund] I thought so.

21:01.995 --> 21:04.996
      (bewitching music)

21:08.501 --> 21:09.533
         - I'm sorry.

21:09.535 --> 21:11.669
      (twinkling music)

21:16.042 --> 21:18.809
- [Edmund] Not yet you're not.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.847
       If you refuse to
     stay in bed at night,

21:24.917 --> 21:27.018
        the punishment
      will fit the crime.

21:27.020 --> 21:29.820
        (troubled music)

21:42.702 --> 21:43.934
   - [Charlotte Voiceover]
There's this place I try to go

21:43.936 --> 21:45.536
  when I can't get to sleep.

21:46.873 --> 21:48.906
         (Max grunts)

21:48.908 --> 21:50.341
     It's nothing special.

21:51.811 --> 21:54.679
      (celestial music)

21:56.749 --> 21:59.884
It's just flat earth stretching
     on forever around me.

21:59.886 --> 22:02.620
        (fan whirring)

22:03.856 --> 22:06.657
        (dreadful music)

22:15.868 --> 22:17.401
      No one can see me.

22:20.740 --> 22:22.440
     Nothing can touch me.

22:22.442 --> 22:25.543
        (woman laughing)

22:25.545 --> 22:27.611
        (woman moaning)

22:27.613 --> 22:29.747
     (electronic whirring)

22:29.749 --> 22:30.815
      (car horn honking)

22:30.817 --> 22:33.851
(people chattering and laughing)

22:33.853 --> 22:36.420
         (eerie music)

22:45.131 --> 22:48.032
      (woman screaming)

22:52.939 --> 22:55.773
        (fiery rumbling)

22:55.775 --> 22:57.775
     Dad said the necklace
     needed to look rusted

22:57.777 --> 22:59.677
for the reporter and the cops.

23:01.147 --> 23:03.781
It upset me to see it that way.

23:03.783 --> 23:05.983
    Especially since we'd
  only just gotten it back.

23:07.520 --> 23:10.388
   - I try and remember more
about what happened that night,

23:10.390 --> 23:13.557
      and I figure if he
     ran in this direction

23:13.559 --> 23:14.925
  from where he left his car,

23:16.429 --> 23:19.930
  it's possible he would've
     hit this road here.

23:23.035 --> 23:25.603
 And the time that it took him
  from where he left the car

23:25.605 --> 23:28.406
     means he would've got
    there around 11:00 p.m.

23:28.408 --> 23:31.675
      Now, this is where
       it gets spooky.

23:32.779 --> 23:34.812
      I had a dream last
     night with Juliette.

23:35.848 --> 23:37.681
 I'm sitting out by the pool,

23:37.683 --> 23:39.917
     and she's got these
    cards in front of her.

23:39.919 --> 23:42.186
She turns over the first card.

23:42.188 --> 23:44.889
There's a picture of a pendant.

23:44.891 --> 23:47.925
    Thing is, it's the same
    pendant she was wearing

23:47.927 --> 23:49.627
  the night she was killed,

23:49.629 --> 23:51.996
    the very same pendant
  that was reported missing

23:51.998 --> 23:54.632
     from the hit-and-run
     scene six years ago.

23:54.634 --> 23:55.499
  - [Joe] That's very weird.

23:55.501 --> 23:56.700
    - Well it gets weirder.

23:56.702 --> 23:58.936
 She turns over the next card.

23:58.938 --> 24:01.539
     There's a picture of
     a Great White shark.

24:01.541 --> 24:03.040
 And I look out into the pool,

24:03.042 --> 24:04.975
      the fucking thing's
         in the water!

24:06.012 --> 24:07.812
        So next day, I
      start checking down

24:07.814 --> 24:09.613
     some of these motels
        and roadhouses

24:09.615 --> 24:10.815
  along this stretch of road

24:10.817 --> 24:12.183
to try and get records of anyone

24:12.185 --> 24:13.884
that booked in late that night.

24:13.886 --> 24:15.152
      And there was one.

24:15.154 --> 24:17.588
        In a place that
      rents beach shacks.

24:19.091 --> 24:22.927
      Now, you ever heard
        of Jesse Atlas?

24:22.929 --> 24:24.161
             - No.

24:24.163 --> 24:25.229
    - Well the poor son of
     a bitch was attacked

24:25.231 --> 24:26.997
 and killed by a Great White,

24:26.999 --> 24:28.632
        bitten in half,

24:28.634 --> 24:31.569
 the very day before Juliette
  and I were hit by the car.

24:32.738 --> 24:33.671
 - It's very strange, and all,

24:33.673 --> 24:34.872
but I don't see as any relevance

24:34.874 --> 24:36.474
to what we're talking about now.

24:36.476 --> 24:38.042
  - Well Joe, it just seems
  that it would've been hard

24:38.044 --> 24:40.211
     for him to have booked
    into a motel that night,

24:40.213 --> 24:41.679
          that's all,

24:41.681 --> 24:44.081
      especially being in
      two fucking pieces!

24:45.218 --> 24:47.251
  Someone was booked in under
    a fake name that night,

24:47.253 --> 24:50.054
     that they lifted from
     that day's headline!

24:50.056 --> 24:53.123
        (creepy music)

24:53.125 --> 24:55.960
        (fan rattling)

25:05.271 --> 25:06.203
        Exercise time.

25:07.540 --> 25:08.272
      - [Woman On Radio]
        Coming up next

25:08.274 --> 25:10.074
 we have a very special guest

25:10.076 --> 25:12.643
        who just had a
      very special gift.

25:12.645 --> 25:14.945
          (splashing)

25:14.947 --> 25:17.047
        (heavenly music)

25:17.049 --> 25:21.652
      (voices chattering
       over each other)

25:33.666 --> 25:35.666
    - [Max Voiceover] Edmund
      was totally insane,

25:35.668 --> 25:37.067
  but he wasn't a total fool.

25:38.104 --> 25:39.603
        He had a plan.

25:39.605 --> 25:41.939
       - Now let's get
     this story straight.

25:41.941 --> 25:43.307
When you arrived at the motel,

25:43.309 --> 25:45.776
  you accidentally drop the
   pendant down the drain.

25:45.778 --> 25:47.077
  - [Max Voiceover] And it
  wasn't just this bullshit

25:47.079 --> 25:49.113
      about Juliette and
       the tarot cards.

25:49.115 --> 25:50.114
    That was the sideshow.

25:51.617 --> 25:54.118
    Carnie showmanship for
    the psychic TV crowd.

25:56.022 --> 25:57.655
 The real stuff would be found

25:57.657 --> 25:59.023
 in the book he was going to
release after I'd been caught,

25:59.025 --> 26:01.091
      which would explain
     how he really did it.

26:02.828 --> 26:05.896
    Precise detective work
    and endless research.

26:06.999 --> 26:10.100
     Which of course would
    also be total bullshit.

26:10.102 --> 26:11.669
  And what does that matter?

26:13.105 --> 26:14.705
      He had me to help
      him bend the truth

26:14.707 --> 26:16.106
  whichever way he saw fit.

26:17.310 --> 26:18.976
  People could put holes in
  their stories and evidence

26:18.978 --> 26:20.077
        all they liked,

26:20.079 --> 26:22.012
but as long as I was in of it,

26:22.014 --> 26:24.748
    no one would ever know
  for certain how he did it.

26:26.886 --> 26:29.286
  - [Charlotte Voiceover] As
ridiculous as dad's story was,

26:29.288 --> 26:31.889
  it only seemed a fraction
    worse than the truth.

26:35.828 --> 26:37.761
Max had barely hidden his car.

26:37.763 --> 26:40.097
He'd obviously faked his name.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.099
  He kept the number plates.

26:42.101 --> 26:43.200
     He kept the necklace.

26:46.105 --> 26:49.006
    Yet somehow, until he
    showed up at our door,

26:49.008 --> 26:50.908
  not a soul knew he did it.

26:53.012 --> 26:56.113
    It was as if he hadn't
     been running at all,

26:56.115 --> 26:57.147
         just waiting.

26:57.917 --> 26:59.683
     Waiting to be caught.

26:59.685 --> 27:01.385
    Waiting to be punished.

27:01.387 --> 27:03.621
        (fan rattling)

27:03.623 --> 27:06.256
        (feverish music)

27:12.632 --> 27:15.633
      (electric zapping)

27:22.808 --> 27:23.707
            - Fuck.

27:30.850 --> 27:33.684
        (sonic rumbling)

27:45.831 --> 27:48.899
      (ghostly breathing)

27:54.340 --> 27:55.906
          (splashing)

27:55.908 --> 27:58.442
        (elegant music)

28:20.032 --> 28:23.767
  (moves into dreadful music)

28:29.108 --> 28:32.042
        (fiery roaring)

28:35.147 --> 28:37.881
     - You've captured it.
        - Captured it.

28:37.883 --> 28:40.184
      - You can kill him.
      - Waiting for you.

28:40.186 --> 28:41.719
     - [Female Voiceover]
     You've captured it.

28:41.721 --> 28:45.923
     - [Female Voiceover] I
    don't deserve it though.

28:45.925 --> 28:47.091
  (female voices whispering)

28:47.093 --> 28:49.860
      (heavy breathing)

28:49.862 --> 28:52.229
         (crazy music)

30:23.222 --> 30:25.989
  - What are your thoughts?

30:25.991 --> 30:27.224
        - Hard to say.

30:28.294 --> 30:29.560
 Might've been six years ago,

30:29.562 --> 30:31.528
    but this place feels
  like he's only just left.

30:31.530 --> 30:34.498
      (suspicious music)

30:38.337 --> 30:39.303
    - [Charlotte Voiceover]
     There was a new story

30:39.305 --> 30:40.971
about what happened that night.

30:40.973 --> 30:43.907
- If you'd just killed someone
 and horribly maimed another,

30:43.909 --> 30:45.275
what would you do when you go?

30:45.277 --> 30:46.944
   - [Charlotte Voiceover]
  This time when Max arrived

30:46.946 --> 30:49.012
 at the motel he accidentally
    dropped mum's necklace

30:49.014 --> 30:50.080
        down the sink.

30:50.082 --> 30:52.416
         (scary music)

30:58.290 --> 31:00.123
    On the same day dad was
     showing the reporter

31:00.125 --> 31:01.491
    where mom's pendant was,

31:01.493 --> 31:02.960
      a girl I used to
      go to school with

31:02.962 --> 31:05.295
    had been found stabbed
    to death in her home.

31:06.465 --> 31:08.565
    They caught the killer
      in an old factory.

31:10.336 --> 31:12.236
      He shared the place
    with the body of a girl

31:12.238 --> 31:14.404
      who went missing up
     north five years ago.

31:15.274 --> 31:17.641
        Or what was left
        of her, I guess.

31:19.211 --> 31:21.078
 - [Woman In Movie] She looks
  so strange, with her eyes.

31:21.614 --> 31:23.380
  - [Charlotte Voiceover] Dad
   was still the front page.

31:23.382 --> 31:27.317
  ("Sid and Nancy" by Batz)

31:27.319 --> 31:29.519
- Any searching that room yet?

31:29.521 --> 31:32.222
      - Uh, we'll be out
      of your hair soon.

31:32.224 --> 31:33.123
            So um,

31:34.260 --> 31:35.459
you haven't remembered anymore

31:35.461 --> 31:37.961
    about the man who booked
      in here that night?

31:37.963 --> 31:39.997
      - Only what I told
       the other cops.

31:39.999 --> 31:42.132
     He called complaining
     about his television,

31:42.134 --> 31:43.500
      said it was broken.

31:43.502 --> 31:45.402
  - [Sophia] Which it wasn't.

31:45.404 --> 31:46.970
        - That's right.

31:46.972 --> 31:48.405
When we checked it, it was fine.

31:51.210 --> 31:52.175
- [Sophia] And you describe him

31:52.177 --> 31:53.677
  as an unassuming young man.

31:53.679 --> 31:55.412
     Are you sure you can't
    remember anymore details

31:55.414 --> 31:56.446
  about what he looked like?

31:56.448 --> 31:57.414
    - It was six years ago!

31:58.984 --> 32:00.384
    Look, he didn't have a
  swastika between his eyes,

32:00.386 --> 32:02.352
    if you know what I mean.

32:02.354 --> 32:03.654
      - [Sophia] What are
       you doing there?

32:04.590 --> 32:06.556
      - Scratch and win.

32:06.558 --> 32:09.493
     - Are you sure you're
     not just scratching?

32:09.495 --> 32:11.461
  - Gotta be in it to win it.

32:11.463 --> 32:12.429
      - What do you win?

32:14.333 --> 32:15.465
      - A million bones.

32:16.969 --> 32:18.135
          A big boat.

32:18.137 --> 32:19.469
        Home makeover.

32:19.471 --> 32:21.638
 You know, all kinds of stuff.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.106
            - Yeah?

32:23.108 --> 32:24.374
     Well what will you do
     if you win the money?

32:24.376 --> 32:25.542
 - I'll fucking give it away,

32:25.544 --> 32:26.410
          to charity.

32:26.412 --> 32:27.511
             - Mm.

32:29.248 --> 32:30.180
    Well that's really nice.

32:30.182 --> 32:31.281
             - Mm.

32:31.283 --> 32:34.084
      - Good, good idea.
           - Mm-hm.

32:36.689 --> 32:39.489
- [Edmund] So what did you do
when you left the beach shack?

32:39.491 --> 32:41.258
       - [Max] I caught
      a bus the next day

32:42.061 --> 32:43.026
      and I headed home.

32:44.029 --> 32:45.028
      - [Edmund] A bus?

32:45.030 --> 32:46.463
         - [Max] Yeah.

32:46.465 --> 32:48.231
        - Were you gonna
        hide the plates?

32:48.233 --> 32:49.967
  - Yeah, it crossed my mind.

32:49.969 --> 32:51.501
        - Whereabouts?

32:51.503 --> 32:52.336
          - The Sun.

32:52.338 --> 32:53.570
            - Sorry?

32:53.572 --> 32:55.072
          - The Sun.

32:55.074 --> 32:57.007
     It's an old mineshaft
     just outside of town.

32:57.676 --> 33:01.111
    (knocking on the door)

33:03.082 --> 33:04.514
       - [Sophia] Oh, hi
    Charlotte, how's things?

33:04.516 --> 33:05.482
        - Hi, uh, great.

33:05.484 --> 33:06.717
         How are you?

33:06.719 --> 33:07.517
     - [Sophia] I'm a bit
      stressed actually.

33:07.519 --> 33:09.152
      Is your dad about?

33:09.154 --> 33:11.088
  - Uh, he's, he's actually
     busy at the moment.

33:11.089 --> 33:13.023
  - [Sophia] Yeah, well look,
   I really need to see him.

33:13.025 --> 33:14.691
     - Um, I'll find him.

33:14.693 --> 33:16.226
  Um, I'll get him for you.

33:16.228 --> 33:18.362
      - [Sophia] Oh, no,
     look, I'll find him.

33:18.364 --> 33:20.430
      - It fits together
     like a fucking watch.

33:23.102 --> 33:25.469
        ¶ Pray for me ¶

33:30.275 --> 33:32.642
     - Detective Valmont,
     what brings you here?

33:34.513 --> 33:36.246
 - Our cream of the crop here.

33:36.248 --> 33:37.447
  - [Edmund] Uh, Charlotte,
      could you please

33:37.449 --> 33:39.082
      show the detective
    back inside the house,

33:39.084 --> 33:41.318
and I will meet with her when
I've got sufficient Vitamin D.

33:44.123 --> 33:45.722
        - With all due
      respect, Mr. Bloom,

33:45.724 --> 33:47.591
    you're going to have to
     surrender the pendant

33:47.593 --> 33:49.793
 or it's withholding evidence.

33:49.795 --> 33:50.761
            - Hey.

33:50.763 --> 33:52.195
    My stuff is your stuff.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.299
      Look, can we please
        talk about this

33:56.301 --> 33:58.235
  somewhere more appropriate?

33:58.237 --> 33:59.770
  Inside my own house maybe?

33:59.772 --> 34:02.606
        (strange music)

34:24.429 --> 34:25.795
     - [Sophia] Your wife
     was very beautiful.

34:25.797 --> 34:28.364
        - Never heard a
      bad word about her.

34:28.367 --> 34:30.634
 - [Sophia] People didn't like
 you so much though, did they?

34:30.636 --> 34:31.568
         - Come again?

34:31.570 --> 34:33.235
- People, they didn't like you.

34:33.237 --> 34:34.638
      - [Woman Voiceover]
       Hold your breath.

34:34.639 --> 34:35.472
      - [Woman Voiceover]
       Hold your breath.

34:35.474 --> 34:37.007
        (woman gasping)

34:37.007 --> 34:38.541
      - [Woman Voiceover]
       Dive in, dive in.

34:38.543 --> 34:40.643
       - So have you got
     another teaser for me

34:40.646 --> 34:42.646
     on what happens next?

34:42.648 --> 34:44.114
      - I don't know yet.

34:44.116 --> 34:45.649
    - Well I reckon that he
    called public transport

34:45.650 --> 34:47.284
         the next day.

34:47.286 --> 34:48.685
 There's a bus that stops near
  the motel and heads north.

34:48.687 --> 34:50.120
      - Or he hitchhiked.

34:50.121 --> 34:51.455
       - I don't think
      so, not this guy.

34:51.456 --> 34:52.722
    I've just got a feeling.

34:54.726 --> 34:57.594
        (deep rumbling)

34:57.596 --> 35:00.730

    When I was old enough,

35:01.667 --> 35:03.233
 mum made me learn first aid.

35:06.205 --> 35:07.604
  I only remember two things.

35:11.743 --> 35:14.411
     A fast heartbeat is
     bad for snake bites.

35:17.449 --> 35:19.216
      And when people are
      trapped in a fire,

35:19.218 --> 35:20.650
they don't always burn to death.

35:20.652 --> 35:23.653
        (mystical music)

35:28.327 --> 35:30.694
    Sometimes their insides
    get so hot and blistered

35:30.696 --> 35:32.696
     that their lungs fill
     with their own fluid.

35:36.702 --> 35:37.868
        And they drown.

35:37.870 --> 35:40.403
      (electric buzzing)

35:40.405 --> 35:42.772

36:50.375 --> 36:53.343
      (suspicious music)

36:57.616 --> 37:01.384
    - You could've drowned
    today, but you didn't.

37:02.688 --> 37:04.988
       You ignored that
     voice inside saying,

37:04.990 --> 37:08.291
 "I'm just a worthless fuckup
   wasting time and oxygen.

37:10.262 --> 37:11.695
  "Maybe I should just die."

37:14.633 --> 37:16.733
     That can't have been
     easy to ignore, Max.

37:17.669 --> 37:19.703
         But you did.

37:19.705 --> 37:22.772
      You held on to see
      this thing through.

37:22.774 --> 37:24.307
     I respect that, Max.

37:24.977 --> 37:26.243
     I'm gonna let you in

37:27.312 --> 37:28.478
      on a little secret.

37:30.716 --> 37:32.816
 Juliette's still alive, Max.

37:32.818 --> 37:35.819
      (mysterious music)

37:37.990 --> 37:40.724
        (Edmund laughs)

37:43.295 --> 37:44.594
 - [Max] You're fucking crazy.

37:44.596 --> 37:46.963
         (misty music)

37:48.300 --> 37:49.032
         - Come again?

37:50.669 --> 37:51.768
         - I'm sorry.

37:53.572 --> 37:54.838
I'm pretty rattled after today.

37:54.840 --> 37:56.373
 Drowning's pretty exhausting.

37:56.375 --> 37:58.642
    - Yeah, you should try
    getting hit by a car.

37:59.478 --> 38:00.744
    It's a fucking marathon.

38:01.947 --> 38:04.314
     I would've killed for
     the pain to go away.

38:06.485 --> 38:07.917
Until I couldn't feel my legs.

38:09.054 --> 38:10.987
      Now I'd kill for it
      to come back again.

38:15.794 --> 38:16.960
          Look, Max,

38:17.829 --> 38:20.297
        I'm sorry I made
        that joke, okay?

38:20.299 --> 38:21.798
     I do that sometimes.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.801
It's just my way of, you know,
 dealing with what happened.

38:24.803 --> 38:26.469
       Paramedics do the
     same thing, you know,

38:26.471 --> 38:27.804
    to help with the horror.

38:29.875 --> 38:31.641
      - [Max] Yeah, well
       whatever works.

38:33.912 --> 38:34.811
            - Yeah.

38:35.981 --> 38:36.846
             Well.

38:37.849 --> 38:38.948
        I'm off to bed.

38:40.819 --> 38:41.985
  I'll see you in the spring.

38:45.324 --> 38:46.856
      Max said he almost
        drowned today.

38:49.061 --> 38:50.060
      You saved his life.

38:52.364 --> 38:53.563
     - I almost left him.

38:55.701 --> 38:57.767
  - [Edmund] I would've been
very angry if you'd done that.

38:59.771 --> 39:02.405
   After all, he's almost as
innocent as me and your mother.

39:03.875 --> 39:06.076
 He didn't know what happened
    any more than we did.

39:07.779 --> 39:10.013
  He tried to get away with
    it, but he manned up.

39:10.015 --> 39:10.947
        He came clean.

39:10.949 --> 39:13.950
        (mystical music)

39:15.454 --> 39:16.353
             Now.

39:18.457 --> 39:19.823
    Listen to me carefully.

39:19.825 --> 39:22.559
        (totemic music)

39:24.429 --> 39:27.697
  Tomorrow you take Max back
    to where he came from.

39:27.699 --> 39:30.667
      (spell-like music)

39:38.043 --> 39:40.577
    I want you to follow him
     to a mineshaft nearby

39:40.579 --> 39:41.644

39:48.520 --> 39:49.886
    And when you get there,

39:49.888 --> 39:51.921
 you make sure he does exactly

39:52.891 --> 39:53.857
    what he's supposed to.

39:56.928 --> 39:58.461
  We're getting closer now.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.600

      been set in motion.

     about that detective?

40:42.707 --> 40:45.575
      (perplexed music)

40:48.980 --> 40:51.181
   I'm just worried that she
 might start to figure it out.

40:51.183 --> 40:54.017
        (sneaky music)

40:57.088 --> 40:58.988
    - Don't worry about her.

40:58.990 --> 41:01.858
She wouldn't be able to figure
   out a fucking egg timer.

41:04.963 --> 41:06.729
     Now even though you
    don't deserve a reward

41:06.731 --> 41:08.031
        for saving Max,

41:09.968 --> 41:10.934
        I'll allow it.

41:14.005 --> 41:15.171
- Can I have my pictures back?

41:15.173 --> 41:16.072
             - No.

41:17.576 --> 41:19.742
     You've well and truly
     lost that privilege.

41:23.048 --> 41:24.981
    Because you did so well,

41:27.018 --> 41:27.984
    something even better.

41:29.921 --> 41:31.821

      in my bed tonight.

a charity modeling competition
    for the girls in town.

   Somehow dad's story had
  made her seem alive again

41:44.069 --> 41:45.535
    and him seem tolerable.

41:47.739 --> 41:50.106
  They asked dad to present
    the winner that year.

 support that you've given me

42:00.886 --> 42:02.185

42:03.889 --> 42:06.289
      I just hope that I
     can prove to you all

  that justice is something
     worth fighting for.

     Juliette's helping me
    solve this crime or not,

42:13.999 --> 42:17.200

      back home, is it?

45:30.829 --> 45:32.061
  It's a fucking good song!

45:32.063 --> 45:33.196
         Come on, Max!

45:33.198 --> 45:35.932
    - I don't want to dance.
           - Come on!

45:35.934 --> 45:38.201
       You'll dance with
      me, won't you, son?

45:38.203 --> 45:43.272
         ¶ On a deal ¶

45:47.746 --> 45:49.212
        ¶ Here we go ¶

45:49.214 --> 45:51.280
   - [Charlotte Voiceover]
 It's as if she wasn't there.

45:52.784 --> 45:53.416
         (car zooming)

45:53.418 --> 45:54.383
      On another planet.

45:56.888 --> 45:59.222
        (engine roaring)

45:59.224 --> 46:01.858
 He wanted to break her finger
    or slap her in the face

46:03.128 --> 46:04.260
  just to see if she felt it.

46:04.262 --> 46:06.095
        (engine roaring)

46:06.097 --> 46:07.263
      ¶ We made a deal ¶

46:07.265 --> 46:09.232
  ¶ Oh yeah we made a deal ¶

46:09.234 --> 46:11.334
        ¶ Oh my deal ¶

46:11.336 --> 46:12.969
    ¶ Yeah we had a deal ¶

46:12.971 --> 46:14.804
      - [Max Voiceover]
      I had a brother.

46:14.806 --> 46:15.505
        He's dead now.

46:17.408 --> 46:18.908
     I imagine I would've
         had more too

46:18.910 --> 46:20.476
      had mum not wised
      up to abortions.

46:22.280 --> 46:23.880
        What can I say?

46:23.882 --> 46:24.914
      She loves fucking.

46:26.050 --> 46:27.383
  She had no choice really.

46:27.385 --> 46:29.318
        She was raised a
        strict Catholic.

46:30.421 --> 46:32.021
      Every now and then
      mum would get drunk

46:32.023 --> 46:33.389
  and tell me about my dad.

46:34.359 --> 46:36.292
  The story always changed.

46:37.362 --> 46:38.261
         He was a cop.

46:39.130 --> 46:40.329
     Then he was a marine.

46:41.232 --> 46:43.366
     He was even a fucking
      secret agent once.

46:44.903 --> 46:46.269
I eventually tracked him down.

46:47.238 --> 46:49.038
He shot wild dogs for a living.

46:51.242 --> 46:52.809
At least he had a gun I guess.

46:53.878 --> 46:55.845
     (chilled rock music)

46:55.847 --> 46:59.081
     (cigarette crackling)

47:06.558 --> 47:07.523
        - Who's Mason?

47:09.828 --> 47:10.526
            - What?

47:11.963 --> 47:12.862
            - Mason.

47:16.067 --> 47:17.166
      I heard you talking
       with your mother

47:17.168 --> 47:18.401
  about someone called Mason.

47:21.272 --> 47:23.339
      (thunder rumbling)

47:23.341 --> 47:24.607
    Sounded like he's dead.

47:24.609 --> 47:26.309
      (glass shattering)

47:26.311 --> 47:29.512
    (nonchalant rock music)

47:37.989 --> 47:39.856
      (lighter flicking)

47:39.858 --> 47:40.556
          Who is he?

47:42.393 --> 47:43.359
         - My brother.

47:45.396 --> 47:47.163
      - [Charlotte] And?

47:50.268 --> 47:51.434
      - And he got sick.

47:54.305 --> 47:55.238
    - How did he get sick?

47:55.240 --> 47:58.307
      (voices whispering)

48:00.311 --> 48:01.377
      Did you poison him?

48:02.146 --> 48:03.412
          (smashing)

48:03.414 --> 48:06.249
      (voices whispering)

48:10.121 --> 48:13.256
     (relaxed rock music)

48:19.430 --> 48:22.265
       - [Max] He died
     slowly and painfully

48:22.267 --> 48:23.232
        over six years.

48:23.234 --> 48:26.235
      (thunder rumbling)

48:27.372 --> 48:28.337
      - When did he die?

48:29.574 --> 48:30.406
    - What does it matter?

48:30.408 --> 48:31.440
            - When?

48:31.442 --> 48:32.341
          - Recently.

48:34.445 --> 48:36.078
      - So that's why you
       never came clean.

48:37.382 --> 48:38.347
  You had to look after him.

48:38.349 --> 48:41.183
        (fire roaring)

48:44.522 --> 48:47.523
      (thunder rumbling)

48:59.337 --> 49:00.569
- [Charlotte Voiceover] I like
  to think that's the reason

49:00.571 --> 49:02.438
      why Max never came
       clean about mum.

49:07.512 --> 49:08.377
  He never said that though.

49:12.483 --> 49:13.582
        I wish he had.

49:14.619 --> 49:17.453
        (fire roaring)

49:23.394 --> 49:25.528
  - Can I tell you a story?

49:27.732 --> 49:29.632
      (thunder rumbling)

49:29.634 --> 49:33.002

49:36.674 --> 49:39.442
         (scary music)

49:44.449 --> 49:47.183
  - [Woman On TV] Richard, do
you think the sheriff is right,

49:47.185 --> 49:50.152
  that the same person that
   killed Bud killed Tom?

49:50.154 --> 49:51.754
    - [Man On TV] Not much.

49:51.756 --> 49:54.557
    If it's a person at all.

49:54.559 --> 49:57.360
        (mystical music)

49:58.396 --> 50:00.396
         (phone rings)

50:00.398 --> 50:01.764
      - Charlotte, where
      the fuck are you?

50:01.766 --> 50:03.632
    - [Max] That's no way to
    speak to your daughter.

50:03.634 --> 50:05.101
 - What have you done to her?

50:05.103 --> 50:06.435
     - [Max] Don't panic,
     dad, she's sleeping.

50:06.437 --> 50:07.470
    Now what's the problem?

50:07.472 --> 50:08.404
      - Don't play dumb.

50:08.406 --> 50:11.007
The cops have your fingerprints!

50:11.009 --> 50:12.108
    They were on the inside
      of a television set

50:12.110 --> 50:13.709
    inside the motel room!

50:13.711 --> 50:15.611
    You opened it up to fix
  the reception or something.

50:15.613 --> 50:18.481
   The point is the owner
  still has the fucking TV!

50:20.084 --> 50:21.684
        Your prints on
     record for anything?

50:25.423 --> 50:26.622
            - Yes.

50:26.624 --> 50:28.424
    I got caught with weed
    when I was a teenager.

50:28.426 --> 50:29.592
       - Why didn't you
      tell me about this?

50:29.594 --> 50:31.060
    Now everything's fucked!

50:33.064 --> 50:35.131
Not gonna say sorry this time?

50:35.133 --> 50:37.366
  (laughs) That's a change.

50:37.368 --> 50:38.567
 Anyway, this is not over yet.

50:38.569 --> 50:40.436
 I'll think of something new.

50:40.438 --> 50:42.571
       We've just got a
     ticking clock is all.

50:44.475 --> 50:47.510
  - I'm coming to kill you.

50:47.512 --> 50:48.577
            - What?

50:51.416 --> 50:53.482
  - I'm coming to kill you.

50:53.484 --> 50:55.484
I've seen the newspaper articles

50:55.486 --> 50:57.486
and I know that you're on to me,

50:57.488 --> 50:59.422
      so I'm coming to
      town to kill you.

51:00.491 --> 51:01.424
      You have a dream.

51:01.426 --> 51:02.625
 Juliette tells you I'm coming

51:02.627 --> 51:04.493
       and that you'll
      be waiting for me.

51:04.495 --> 51:06.562
    - [Edmund] And I disable
      you in my own house.

51:06.564 --> 51:07.797
     - And then I confess,

51:07.799 --> 51:09.298
      you find the plates
       to seal the deal.

51:09.300 --> 51:10.299
      - [Edmund] And then

51:11.302 --> 51:13.502
    you're finally forgiven.

51:13.504 --> 51:14.403
             - No.

51:16.107 --> 51:17.139
    You forgive Charlotte.

51:17.141 --> 51:20.109
      (mysterious music)

51:22.113 --> 51:23.546
 - What are you talking about?

51:23.548 --> 51:25.614
     - [Max] You know what
      I'm talking about.

51:27.285 --> 51:30.152
       You blame her for
     the accident, not me.

51:32.590 --> 51:34.356
You're never to see her again.

51:35.359 --> 51:36.559
          She's free.

51:36.561 --> 51:39.228
     - You are a cold son
     of a bitch after all.

51:39.230 --> 51:40.596
  - [Max] Do we have a deal?

51:43.835 --> 51:44.767
      - Any other terms?

51:45.636 --> 51:47.603
    - [Max] You do it now.

51:47.605 --> 51:50.206

51:55.179 --> 51:55.811
    - [Charlotte Voiceover]
      Something washed up

51:55.813 --> 51:56.879
      on the shore once.

51:58.749 --> 52:01.117
      It didn't look like
    anything I'd ever seen.

52:02.587 --> 52:04.687
 It was all spikes and teeth.

52:06.491 --> 52:09.125
  I couldn't tell if it was
  that way to attack things

52:10.528 --> 52:11.760
     or to protect itself.

52:13.764 --> 52:14.897
     I would've killed it,

52:16.234 --> 52:17.766
      but I didn't want
      to get that close.

52:20.771 --> 52:22.271
      I just walked away.

52:23.875 --> 52:25.407
     Hoping it would die.

52:25.409 --> 52:28.477
      (upbeat surf music)

52:31.816 --> 52:32.715
          - You okay?

52:34.652 --> 52:35.651
          - I'm fine.

52:38.289 --> 52:40.556
- [Max] We should hit the road.

52:40.558 --> 52:41.657
             - Uh,

52:41.659 --> 52:42.758
            no, I,

52:45.630 --> 52:47.596
      I'm not gonna go
      home for a while.

52:48.900 --> 52:49.832
While I'm all the way out here,

52:49.834 --> 52:51.567

52:52.403 --> 52:53.702
  No rush for me to be back.

52:54.772 --> 52:56.705
    - So what should I do?

52:59.277 --> 53:00.376
    - You can take the bus.

      When I was a kid,

53:51.762 --> 53:53.562

     Don't worry about it.

53:58.269 --> 53:58.934
        Just leave it.

 take some home with me once,

     a jar of my own piss.

54:06.711 --> 54:08.377
 I've got memories like that.

54:09.714 --> 54:11.180
    And they're beautiful,

      but they change the
    closer you get to them.

54:13.851 --> 54:15.951
       It's best just to
    leave those ones alone,

54:17.688 --> 54:19.255

54:43.714 --> 54:45.881
    It won't hurt to be seen
    around my place either,

54:45.883 --> 54:48.317
as if you're casing the joint.

54:48.319 --> 54:49.785
      Book into a motel,

     and head for his room

55:43.908 --> 55:45.908
      Then as I'm down,

55:45.909 --> 55:47.909
  he calls the cops and tells
   them he shot an intruder.

55:50.681 --> 55:53.682
 They show up, I get arrested,

55:53.684 --> 55:55.050
      and it's all over.

55:56.554 --> 55:59.822
  But I knew what he really
     had planned for me.

56:01.058 --> 56:01.890
        (gunshot fires)

56:01.892 --> 56:04.660
         (eerie music)

56:15.806 --> 56:18.640
(moves into upbeat surf music)

56:18.642 --> 56:21.377
      (thunder rumbling)

56:21.379 --> 56:22.111
  - [Charlotte Voiceover] You
   can't remember everything

56:22.113 --> 56:24.947
about someone when they're dead.

56:26.851 --> 56:28.617
          (banging)
  You try your best though.

56:31.856 --> 56:34.423
  Mum told me if I dropped my
  comb while combing my hair,

56:38.162 --> 56:39.628
  something bad was coming.

56:39.629 --> 56:41.095
   I used to grip my comb so
tight my knuckles turned white.

56:42.800 --> 56:43.699
          I still do.

56:45.836 --> 56:48.003
     Once dad hit mum for
      messing up dinner.

56:49.840 --> 56:51.407
 I remember crying all night.

56:52.910 --> 56:55.144
     Mostly because I felt
     like she deserved it.

56:57.047 --> 56:58.947
      I have to hold on
       to that memory.

57:00.518 --> 57:01.450
        Like the rest.

57:02.086 --> 57:03.051
         (phone rings)

57:03.053 --> 57:04.586
  - His name's Steve Linder,

57:04.588 --> 57:05.954
  an electrician from Jild.

57:07.892 --> 57:09.658
     Says he knows nothing
     about the hit and run

57:09.660 --> 57:11.927
        and was merely
     staying at the motel

57:11.929 --> 57:13.462
 on the way to the Southwest.

57:13.464 --> 57:15.597
 - But how'd his fingerprints
    get in the television?

57:15.599 --> 57:16.999
          - Get this.

57:17.001 --> 57:18.100
      Says he was trying
       to open the door

57:18.102 --> 57:20.436
      because he thought
       it was his room.

57:20.438 --> 57:21.870
    When the guy answered,

57:21.872 --> 57:24.773
 he noticed he'd been pulling
    his television apart.

57:24.775 --> 57:26.508
     He offered to fix it.

57:26.510 --> 57:29.478
      After all, he's an
      electrician, right?

57:29.480 --> 57:31.780
         (phone rings)

57:31.782 --> 57:32.948
        - Motherfucker.

57:32.950 --> 57:33.882
         You knew they
      weren't your prints

57:33.884 --> 57:35.984
and you sailed me up the river.

57:35.986 --> 57:36.919
     Why'd you do it, Max?

57:38.022 --> 57:39.655
       As a bargain to
      let Charlotte go?

57:41.025 --> 57:42.758
 You think you're saving her?

57:42.760 --> 57:44.726
        (Edmund laughs)

57:44.728 --> 57:45.861
         Creepy, Max.

57:45.863 --> 57:47.696
         Very creepy.

57:47.698 --> 57:49.965
  - [Max] I'm still prepared
 to hold my end of the bargain

57:49.967 --> 57:52.534
        if you're still
    prepared to hold yours.

57:52.536 --> 57:54.770
     - What, that I never
    see my daughter again?

57:54.772 --> 57:55.871
     - [Max] That's right.

57:56.707 --> 57:58.006
- You're obviously not a parent.

57:59.710 --> 58:00.642
      - What do you mean?

58:00.644 --> 58:02.878
 - Anxiety of influence, Max.

58:02.880 --> 58:05.214
    Everyone knows that kids
     do the exact opposite

58:05.216 --> 58:06.949
    of what you tell them.

58:06.951 --> 58:08.617
  - [Sophia] He was staying
  in one of the other rooms?

58:08.619 --> 58:10.018
         - [Joe] Yes.

58:10.020 --> 58:11.787
  - Where did he say he was
 at the time of the accident?

58:11.789 --> 58:12.855
     - [Joe] On the road.

58:16.527 --> 58:17.993
  - He's telling the truth.

58:17.995 --> 58:18.894
         It's not him.

58:18.896 --> 58:19.962
  - But we've got his prints.

58:19.964 --> 58:21.063
        - It's not him.

58:22.733 --> 58:23.999
     - [Max] I just hope
  there's not too many jobs

58:24.001 --> 58:26.268
  that need urgent attention
      around the house.

58:28.772 --> 58:31.006
  That could be a real hassle
     for someone like you.

58:34.979 --> 58:38.213
     - [Charlotte] Edmund,
    please, I'm, I'm sorry.

58:38.215 --> 58:40.182
     (electronic whirring)

58:40.184 --> 58:42.251
      - I'll sure you'll
    survive though, Edmund.

58:44.522 --> 58:46.054
     (electronic whirring)

58:48.058 --> 58:48.824
          After all,

58:48.825 --> 58:49.591
 no one knows better than I do

58:51.095 --> 58:52.160
    that you're a survivor.

58:54.064 --> 58:55.697
    She's not coming back.

58:55.699 --> 58:57.699
      - My pension will
    barely cover her care.

58:57.701 --> 58:58.667
      You remember that?

59:00.671 --> 59:02.805
Now it's only a matter of time

59:02.806 --> 59:04.940
 before they realize their big
  arrest is a white elephant.

59:04.942 --> 59:06.942
     And you've been seen
       all around town.

59:06.944 --> 59:08.644
     Every colonel wondered
    what you were doing here

59:08.646 --> 59:09.945
while I was solving the mystery.

59:09.947 --> 59:12.014
So let's keep this ending, okay?

59:13.183 --> 59:15.017
    Did you get the knife?

59:15.019 --> 59:16.985
- [Max] Yeah, I got the knife.

59:16.987 --> 59:18.787
            - Good.

59:18.789 --> 59:20.188
  Give it a couple more days.

59:21.091 --> 59:22.291
  Then we finish this thing.

59:26.096 --> 59:27.663
    - [Charlotte Voiceover]
  Western Australia is famous

59:27.665 --> 59:28.797
        for two things.

59:30.768 --> 59:32.601
  Sunburn and shark attacks.

59:32.603 --> 59:35.671
      (upbeat surf music)

59:37.641 --> 59:40.008
   This makes the beach a
  dangerous place to visit.

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:03.865
      - What's going on?

01:00:03.867 --> 01:00:07.102
       - I swear I saw a
    massive shark out there.

01:00:08.005 --> 01:00:09.004
      - You're kidding.

01:00:09.006 --> 01:00:10.105
             - No.

01:00:11.742 --> 01:00:13.675
     Would've been about
     four meters I'd say.

01:00:15.212 --> 01:00:17.045
It's definitely a Great White.

01:00:17.047 --> 01:00:18.647
  It's gotta be the same one.

01:00:19.316 --> 01:00:21.083
    - [Charlotte] Same one?

01:00:21.085 --> 01:00:23.018
    - Well didn't you hear?

01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:24.686
A fisherman got taken yesterday.

01:00:25.756 --> 01:00:26.922
    He got bitten in half.

01:00:29.026 --> 01:00:30.359
  - [Charlotte] Is that it?

01:00:31.729 --> 01:00:33.061
            - Where?

01:00:33.063 --> 01:00:33.895
         - Out there!

01:00:35.766 --> 01:00:37.099
    It's heading out to sea!

01:00:41.905 --> 01:00:42.804

01:00:43.674 --> 01:00:46.008
  I don't normally do this,

01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:49.177
  but uh, me and some mates,
 we're having a bit of a party

01:00:49.179 --> 01:00:50.812
tonight out near the watchtower.

01:00:52.116 --> 01:00:52.981
          You game?

01:00:56.387 --> 01:00:57.252

      help you with that

01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:08.063
 when we get back if you want.

01:01:08.065 --> 01:01:09.297
      - No, that's okay.

01:01:09.299 --> 01:01:11.166
I'll probably be asleep anyway.

01:01:11.168 --> 01:01:13.201
        You guys won't
      get back til late.

01:01:13.203 --> 01:01:14.236
 - [Juliette] Are you kidding?

01:01:14.238 --> 01:01:16.038
      These police balls
        are so boring.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.739
 Any excuse to get out early.

01:01:17.741 --> 01:01:19.675
      - [Edmund] Come on,
      Julie, we're late.

01:01:19.677 --> 01:01:20.308
      - [Juliette] Okay.

01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:21.810
    Bye honey, I love you.

01:01:21.812 --> 01:01:23.078
            - Bye.

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:24.112

        (sirens wailing)

01:03:25.035 --> 01:03:26.501
        And I'm sorry.

01:03:26.503 --> 01:03:29.337
      - [Woman Voiceover]
         You did this.

01:03:29.339 --> 01:03:30.172
         You did this!

01:03:30.174 --> 01:03:32.841

  ("Ston Gon" by Faoul Duke)

01:04:33.604 --> 01:04:37.005
      Go to death right
       in front of me.

01:04:37.007 --> 01:04:39.474
  I don't know if it was the
 guns or it was not the time.

01:04:43.013 --> 01:04:45.447
     But for some reason
     it gave me a hard-on

01:04:45.449 --> 01:04:46.414
    I couldn't get rid of.

01:04:48.285 --> 01:04:50.485
      Eventually I headed
      for the red lights,

01:04:51.421 --> 01:04:53.088
screwed everything with a pulse.

01:04:54.358 --> 01:04:56.424
    Even a fucking amputee.

01:04:56.426 --> 01:04:57.292
          Both legs.

01:04:58.362 --> 01:04:59.628
    I got mugged in the end.

01:05:00.898 --> 01:05:03.465
       Surfaced the next
     day barely breathing,

01:05:03.467 --> 01:05:04.432
      covered in blood.

01:05:06.536 --> 01:05:08.637
     Do you know what para
      siempre means, Max?

01:05:10.374 --> 01:05:11.473
            Forever.

01:05:13.176 --> 01:05:15.443
    Para siempre was written
     on the side of my cock

01:05:15.445 --> 01:05:16.678
  when I woke up in the Sun.

01:05:19.950 --> 01:05:21.416
Do you know why I remember that?

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:25.487
      Because the fucking
     thing was still hard.

01:05:27.958 --> 01:05:31.326
Hanged men would be found with
these irrepressible erections

01:05:31.328 --> 01:05:32.694
after their necks had snapped.

01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:35.196
        Back in the day,

01:05:35.198 --> 01:05:36.631
  they called it angel lust.

01:05:38.001 --> 01:05:39.935
 You know how I learned that?

01:05:39.937 --> 01:05:42.604
   Because the same way I
  woke up that day in Spain

01:05:43.407 --> 01:05:45.340
 was the same way I was found

01:05:45.342 --> 01:05:48.343
  after you left me in the
  dirt with a broken spine.

01:05:49.579 --> 01:05:50.478
          Half dead.

01:05:54.184 --> 01:05:55.583
But carrying a fucking hard-on

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:59.454
    that would've frightened
    the Spanish Inquisition.

01:06:02.592 --> 01:06:04.592
Some things just don't die, Max.

01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:08.363
     Remember that if you
     get any funny ideas

01:06:08.365 --> 01:06:10.465
       about what you're
    supposed to do tonight.

01:06:13.403 --> 01:06:14.736
      I'll see you soon.

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:20.041

01:06:21.979 --> 01:06:23.445
  - [Max Voiceover] I could
    no longer see any bad

01:06:23.447 --> 01:06:24.479
      in killing Edmund.

01:06:24.481 --> 01:06:26.147
    (knocking on the door)

01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:28.016
     - [Edmund] It's open.

01:06:28.018 --> 01:06:30.285
      - [Max Voiceover]
      It was only good.

01:06:30.287 --> 01:06:31.419
      - We need to talk.

01:06:32.622 --> 01:06:36.024
      I'm at such a loss
    over this whole thing.

01:06:36.026 --> 01:06:38.293
     I think it's time to
      look to the stars.

01:06:38.295 --> 01:06:40.495
      (sonic whooshing)

01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:42.130
    - [Max Voiceover] There
     had been a good side

01:06:42.132 --> 01:06:43.231
     to killing Juliette.

01:06:44.234 --> 01:06:45.633
          - Come on.

01:06:45.635 --> 01:06:47.035
 - [Max Voiceover] All my life

01:06:47.037 --> 01:06:48.303
      I'd always felt bad
       about something.

01:06:48.305 --> 01:06:50.238
 - [Sophia] Don't wanna play?

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:51.506
  - [Max Voiceover] Although
  I wasn't really sure what.

01:06:51.508 --> 01:06:54.376
        (creepy music)

01:06:57.047 --> 01:06:58.480
 - Juliette, can you hear me?

01:07:00.417 --> 01:07:02.450
    - [Max Voiceover] From
      her death onwards,

01:07:02.452 --> 01:07:03.351
        I had something.

01:07:06.256 --> 01:07:07.555
        I had her face.

01:07:08.692 --> 01:07:10.392
  - [Sophia] Has Edmund been
    honest with the police

01:07:10.394 --> 01:07:11.659
    about this whole thing?

01:07:11.661 --> 01:07:15.163
        (mystical music)

01:07:15.165 --> 01:07:15.764
         - [Ghost] No.

01:07:15.766 --> 01:07:18.666
      (perplexed music)

01:07:22.239 --> 01:07:24.139
  - [Sophia] Did the killer
  really drop your pendant

01:07:24.141 --> 01:07:27.475
      down a sink at the
      Sunset Shacks Inn?

01:07:27.477 --> 01:07:28.543
         - [Ghost] No.

01:07:28.545 --> 01:07:31.513
      (suspenseful music)

01:07:31.515 --> 01:07:33.314
- [Sophia] Were you ever afraid

01:07:34.451 --> 01:07:35.550
          of Edmund?

01:07:35.552 --> 01:07:38.186
         (eerie music)

01:07:38.188 --> 01:07:38.820
        - [Ghost] Yes.

01:07:38.822 --> 01:07:41.556
        (ghostly music)

01:07:47.297 --> 01:07:50.832
  - [Sophia] Did Edmund ever
 give you reason to be afraid?

01:07:50.834 --> 01:07:53.701
        (spooky music)

01:07:55.472 --> 01:07:56.604
        - [Ghost] Yes.

01:07:56.606 --> 01:07:59.574
      (bewitching music)

01:08:04.448 --> 01:08:06.414
- Would you like to talk about

01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:08.316
his relationship with Charlotte?

01:08:09.352 --> 01:08:11.719
         (eerie music)

01:08:18.562 --> 01:08:19.828
 Nah, she doesn't wanna talk.

01:08:22.732 --> 01:08:25.466
     But she does have one
     other message for me.

01:08:25.469 --> 01:08:28.269
        (mystical music)

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:34.843
    - [Max Voiceover] The
 electrician had my face too.

01:08:34.845 --> 01:08:36.778
     I bumped into him at
  least seven or eight times

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:38.645
      since that night,

01:08:38.648 --> 01:08:39.514
      all over the place,

01:08:39.515 --> 01:08:41.448
      mostly roadhouses.

01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:43.885
        (creepy music)

01:08:48.358 --> 01:08:49.858
     - [Edmund Voiceover]
      Oh for fuck's sake.

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:53.560
        You're a bitch.
       (Sophia laughing)

01:08:53.563 --> 01:08:55.596
    - [Max Voiceover] He had
     no idea where I lived.

01:08:55.599 --> 01:08:57.698
  We had no mutual friends.

01:08:57.701 --> 01:08:59.767
      And he knew nothing
        else about me.

01:08:59.769 --> 01:09:02.470
         (vexed music)

01:09:06.542 --> 01:09:07.841
     But it wasn't gonna
    take much more digging

01:09:07.844 --> 01:09:08.776
      to figure it out.

01:09:08.778 --> 01:09:12.514
  (upbeat percussion music)

01:09:16.252 --> 01:09:18.286
      Whatever happened,

01:09:18.287 --> 01:09:19.720
 I was definitely going down.

01:09:19.723 --> 01:09:22.756
        (vigorous music)

01:09:26.696 --> 01:09:28.763
  I just needed to make sure

01:09:28.765 --> 01:09:30.899
    I wasn't gonna be alive.

01:09:30.901 --> 01:09:32.600
      (squishy thudding)

01:09:32.602 --> 01:09:35.703
      (engine rumbling)

01:10:05.936 --> 01:10:09.204
      (suspenseful music)

01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:26.321
  - [Edmund] You're looking
    for Max, aren't you?

01:10:27.490 --> 01:10:28.573
             - No.

01:10:28.574 --> 01:10:29.657
- Be honest with me, Charlotte.

01:10:30.327 --> 01:10:32.660
      You've fallen for
      him, haven't you?

01:10:32.662 --> 01:10:35.430
         (eerie music)

01:10:40.604 --> 01:10:41.469
             - No.

01:10:44.374 --> 01:10:46.507
      I just want you to
    stop what you're doing.

01:10:48.712 --> 01:10:50.245
You don't have to forgive him,

01:10:50.247 --> 01:10:53.448
      but just let him be
      punished properly.

01:10:53.450 --> 01:10:54.749
        (gunshot fires)

01:10:54.751 --> 01:10:56.718
    - [Edmund] That's what
  it's all about, Charlotte.

01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:58.786
         (misty music)

01:11:05.295 --> 01:11:06.995
        - Where is he?

01:11:06.997 --> 01:11:08.763
  - He'll be back here soon.

01:11:08.765 --> 01:11:11.499
        (door creaking)

01:11:12.369 --> 01:11:13.801
      Now what about you?

01:11:13.803 --> 01:11:16.771
      (untrusting music)

01:11:18.441 --> 01:11:19.741
  You wanna come back home?

01:11:25.582 --> 01:11:26.481
            Come on.

01:11:26.482 --> 01:11:27.381
  Help your old man upstairs.

01:11:27.384 --> 01:11:28.449
     We'll talk about it.

01:11:28.451 --> 01:11:30.918
        (spooky music)

01:11:40.997 --> 01:11:44.432
     (electricity buzzing)

01:12:01.318 --> 01:12:05.386
    - [Charlotte Voiceover]
    I used to like the heat.

01:12:07.624 --> 01:12:08.856
        I hate it now.

01:12:12.629 --> 01:12:13.928
     The grass can't grow.

01:12:17.901 --> 01:12:19.334
        Cars break down.

01:12:19.336 --> 01:12:22.036
      (dreamlike music)

01:12:24.741 --> 01:12:26.374
  The sand hurts your feet.

01:12:26.376 --> 01:12:29.010
        (gleaming music)

01:12:31.614 --> 01:12:33.114
  The light hurts your eyes.

01:12:35.819 --> 01:12:38.052
    - I want a bigger room

01:12:38.054 --> 01:12:40.521
      and I wanna be able
     to stay out at night.

01:12:40.523 --> 01:12:41.756
      - Now honey, you're
      making me nervous.

01:12:41.758 --> 01:12:43.691
     Can you move me back
    from the edge, please?

01:12:45.895 --> 01:12:47.829
        - And I want a
    part-time job in town.

01:12:51.935 --> 01:12:52.767
         - Charlotte.

01:12:52.769 --> 01:12:55.103
         (empty music)

01:12:58.942 --> 01:13:00.408
          Charlotte!

01:13:00.410 --> 01:13:01.142
        Wheel me back!

01:13:01.144 --> 01:13:03.845
        (ghostly music)

01:13:17.727 --> 01:13:21.929
      (voices whispering
       over each other)

01:13:49.559 --> 01:13:52.460
      (heavy breathing)

01:13:55.932 --> 01:13:58.900
      (thunder rumbling)

01:14:07.210 --> 01:14:09.811
          (screaming)

01:14:16.152 --> 01:14:19.053
      (thunder booming)

01:14:39.108 --> 01:14:40.808
      - Where's Edmund?

01:14:41.578 --> 01:14:42.243
        - He's not here.

01:14:42.245 --> 01:14:45.046
        (ethereal music)

01:14:47.717 --> 01:14:48.950
        - Where is he?

01:14:50.019 --> 01:14:51.486
      - Does it matter?

01:14:53.156 --> 01:14:54.188
         You're free.

01:14:54.190 --> 01:14:57.091
      (dreamlike music)

01:15:06.002 --> 01:15:06.934
            - Free.

01:15:06.936 --> 01:15:09.937
        (floating music)

01:15:11.641 --> 01:15:12.874
        We had a plan.

01:15:17.247 --> 01:15:18.513
         - Forget it.

01:15:19.649 --> 01:15:21.115
     He canceled, he just
     wants you to move on.

01:15:21.117 --> 01:15:24.018
      (mystified music)

01:15:31.995 --> 01:15:35.096
      (thunder booming)

01:15:36.065 --> 01:15:38.065
    - What else did he say?

01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:42.703
      - He said that it's
        not your fault,

01:15:44.073 --> 01:15:47.074
  and even though you did the
 wrong thing, he forgives you.

01:15:47.076 --> 01:15:49.644
         (eerie music)

01:15:54.918 --> 01:15:57.251
  - What did he say to you?

01:15:57.253 --> 01:16:00.054
        - He said that
      I'm a good person.

01:16:02.559 --> 01:16:03.891
And that if mum was still alive,

01:16:03.893 --> 01:16:06.761
     she wouldn't be angry
      at me for anything.

01:16:06.763 --> 01:16:09.330
      (dreamlike music)

01:16:09.332 --> 01:16:11.766
        (deep rumbling)

01:16:11.768 --> 01:16:12.767
  - [Max] Do you forgive me?

01:16:12.769 --> 01:16:15.202
        (somber music)

01:16:19.142 --> 01:16:21.642
     - [Edmund Voiceover]
      You're not a bird.

01:16:21.644 --> 01:16:22.310
        You're a mammal.

01:16:22.312 --> 01:16:25.012
          (splashing)

01:16:25.014 --> 01:16:29.350
    You're supposed to live
     in a cave like a bat.

01:16:29.352 --> 01:16:32.086
      (sonic whooshing)

01:16:32.088 --> 01:16:34.121
        (ethereal music)

01:16:34.123 --> 01:16:36.757
You can leave whenever you want,

01:16:36.759 --> 01:16:38.793
      but if this place
      feels like a cave,

01:16:40.263 --> 01:16:42.263
remember that it's also a home.

01:16:44.033 --> 01:16:46.200
        Once you break
      through those bars,

01:16:46.202 --> 01:16:47.201
      you're on your own.

01:16:50.773 --> 01:16:51.606
            Forever.

01:16:51.608 --> 01:16:54.241
        (tranquil music)

01:17:02.185 --> 01:17:03.851
    - [Charlotte Voiceover]
    It only took a few days

01:17:03.853 --> 01:17:06.220
   after they found dad for
 things to go back to normal.

01:17:08.191 --> 01:17:11.626
      (camera clicking)

01:17:11.628 --> 01:17:13.027
    People stopped caring.

01:17:16.299 --> 01:17:18.065
      The following week
      there was a story

01:17:18.067 --> 01:17:20.134
    about someone who'd been
     setting horses on fire

01:17:20.136 --> 01:17:21.402
    with a tin of gasoline.

01:17:21.404 --> 01:17:24.105
         (calm music)

01:17:25.408 --> 01:17:28.676
        (static buzzing)

01:17:28.678 --> 01:17:31.245
    He said at night they
 looked like giant fireflies.

01:17:31.247 --> 01:17:34.148
      (ponderous music)

01:17:44.694 --> 01:17:46.193
  I never spoke to Max again.

01:17:50.066 --> 01:17:51.265
 I wonder about him sometimes.

01:17:51.267 --> 01:17:54.235
      (thoughtful music)

01:17:57.140 --> 01:17:59.173
   People always says they
 don't want to die wondering.

01:17:59.175 --> 01:18:02.009
      (dreamlike music)

01:18:05.148 --> 01:18:07.214
      I think it sounds
    like a nice way to go.
