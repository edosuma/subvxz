01:30.302 --> 01:31.632
Hello?

01:31.643 --> 01:34.375
The matter has
been dealt with.

01:34.793 --> 01:36.879
47?

01:53.062 --> 01:55.188
Half now, half later.

01:56.316 --> 01:58.443
Why do they always
have to do that?

02:21.591 --> 02:23.677
My name is Victor Maynard.

02:23.717 --> 02:25.243
I am 54 years old,

02:25.249 --> 02:28.304
and I work as a
professional killer.

02:38.650 --> 02:41.318
- I love you!
- Shut up.

02:46.698 --> 02:48.069
Who the hell are you?

02:48.074 --> 02:49.654
Je m'appelle Victor Maynard.

02:49.659 --> 02:53.912
J'ai cinquante-quatre ans
et je travaille comme assassin.

02:54.997 --> 02:57.083
Tu veux un peu de cafe?

03:18.813 --> 03:20.898
I love you!

03:25.778 --> 03:27.864
Hello.

03:33.244 --> 03:35.329
Where are we going?

03:39.334 --> 03:41.080
That wasn't me.

03:41.085 --> 03:43.171
I love you, Victor Maynard!

03:44.464 --> 03:46.126
Victor Maynard, I love you.

03:46.131 --> 03:47.463
Oh, the fucker.

03:47.468 --> 03:49.553
Victor Maynard!

03:51.137 --> 03:53.426
You know, I read somewhere
that men who live too long...

03:53.432 --> 03:56.247
with their mothers
tend toward the homosexual.

03:57.018 --> 03:58.348
Really?

03:58.354 --> 04:01.605
You and I lived together
for a long time.

04:01.689 --> 04:03.269
Yes, we did.

04:03.275 --> 04:06.276
You don't... tend,
do you, Victor?

04:06.362 --> 04:08.447
I don't think so, mother.

04:08.488 --> 04:10.360
Then what's the problem?

04:13.953 --> 04:16.411
I actually can't
stay much longer.

04:16.495 --> 04:20.082
I got your card from Paris
with the clipping.

04:20.165 --> 04:23.252
Forty yards, in the street,
with a silencer.

04:23.337 --> 04:24.131
Very dexterous.

04:24.136 --> 04:25.833
Your father would've
been proud.

04:25.838 --> 04:28.074
Opening up the
international side...

04:28.079 --> 04:29.338
of things like that.

04:29.343 --> 04:31.510
Well, I'll call in again soon.

04:31.594 --> 04:34.763
Wait.
There's your birthday.

04:34.848 --> 04:36.933
But that's not until...

04:46.901 --> 04:48.106
Oh...

04:48.111 --> 04:50.820
You--you shouldn't have.

04:50.905 --> 04:52.235
They're all there.

04:52.240 --> 04:57.452
Right from the first,
'Death of an accordionist.'

04:57.536 --> 05:00.039
Plenty of blank pages
at the end, too.

05:02.542 --> 05:05.419
Quite a career.
Quite a legacy.

05:08.965 --> 05:11.674
You're going to be 55, Victor.

05:13.135 --> 05:14.631
I know.

05:14.637 --> 05:17.008
The age your father was
when you were born.

05:17.014 --> 05:18.093
Indeed.

05:18.098 --> 05:20.011
I've taken up knitting.

05:20.016 --> 05:21.930
Blue for a boy.

05:21.936 --> 05:23.808
We can hope, at least.

05:23.813 --> 05:25.560
Good-bye, mother.

05:25.565 --> 05:28.732
Someone has to carry on
the family business.

05:28.818 --> 05:30.903
These skills mustn't be lost.

05:33.197 --> 05:35.283
I've brought you
a present, too.

05:39.329 --> 05:41.871
- His name's Roger.

05:41.955 --> 05:43.577
Roger the parrot.

05:58.262 --> 06:00.347
Ah, merci.

06:10.067 --> 06:13.110
Mm! Mm! Mm.

06:15.781 --> 06:19.368
J'aime particulièrement
les vins de Bourgogne.

06:19.451 --> 06:21.536
Et vous?

06:32.172 --> 06:34.257
Come in ...

06:35.217 --> 06:37.302
Come in...

06:38.052 --> 06:40.722
- Wrong side of the road!
- Wrong way!

06:40.806 --> 06:42.094
Idiot!

06:42.099 --> 06:45.976
I've got to show, show,
show you...

06:46.062 --> 06:48.812
Come into my bed...

06:48.898 --> 06:53.275
I've got to know,
know, know you...

06:53.359 --> 06:56.245
I have dreams
of orca whales...

06:56.250 --> 06:57.234
and owls...

06:57.239 --> 06:59.824
But I wake up in fear...

06:59.908 --> 07:01.946
You will never be my...

07:01.952 --> 07:04.037
You will never
be my fool...

07:04.078 --> 07:06.164
Will never be my fool...

07:07.666 --> 07:09.497
Floaters in my eyes...

07:09.502 --> 07:14.337
Wake up in a hotel room...

07:14.422 --> 07:16.675
Cigarettes and lies...

07:16.759 --> 07:21.720
I am a child,
it's too soon...

07:21.805 --> 07:24.563
I have dreams
of orca whales...

07:24.568 --> 07:25.513
and owls...

07:25.518 --> 07:28.311
But I wake up in fear...

07:28.394 --> 07:30.349
You will never be my...

07:30.354 --> 07:32.523
You will never
be my fool...

07:32.607 --> 07:34.693
Will never be my fool...

07:35.610 --> 07:39.153
A little bag of mm-mm,
a little bag of mm-mm...

07:39.237 --> 07:41.677
So who's the girl
wearing my dress?

07:42.741 --> 07:44.488
I figured
out her number...

07:44.493 --> 07:46.449
Inside a paper napkin...

07:46.454 --> 07:48.996
But I don't
know her address,

07:49.001 --> 07:51.086
I wade downstairs...

07:56.298 --> 07:57.460
Hey!

07:59.258 --> 08:00.504
Rose...

08:00.509 --> 08:02.594
Have you got it?

08:04.305 --> 08:06.390
I'm worried.

08:08.183 --> 08:09.596
I don't want to do this.

08:09.601 --> 08:11.686
- We agreed.
- Yes, I know.

08:13.564 --> 08:15.649
But?

08:17.859 --> 08:20.988
Rose, I need you to
absolutely swear to me,

08:21.071 --> 08:23.693
that nothing bad will happen
to the painting.

08:23.699 --> 08:25.613
Gerry...

08:25.618 --> 08:27.703
I swear.

08:32.957 --> 08:37.004
You know that by doing this,
you're making me very happy.

08:37.087 --> 08:39.042
Yeah.

08:39.047 --> 08:42.634
And if that's not enough,
then just think of the money.

08:45.262 --> 08:48.724
Are you thinking, Gerry?
Hmm?

08:49.892 --> 08:51.347
Yeah.

08:51.352 --> 08:53.437
- Okay.
- Great.

08:58.859 --> 09:02.195
Oh, my God.
It's really, really beautiful.

09:04.657 --> 09:06.070
Where's the copy?

09:06.075 --> 09:08.030
That is the copy.

09:08.035 --> 09:10.120
Here's the original.

09:18.212 --> 09:20.297
Still wet.

09:22.925 --> 09:25.258
Don't get them mixed up.

09:25.343 --> 09:25.761
At home,

09:25.766 --> 09:27.550
the Minister for
Culture, Media...

09:27.555 --> 09:30.009
and Sport described
as 'deeply disappointing'

09:30.015 --> 09:31.695
the sale to a private
Russian buyer...

09:31.701 --> 09:33.514
yesterday of a Rembrandt
self-portrait...

09:33.519 --> 09:34.941
that had been on loan...

09:34.946 --> 09:37.101
to the National
Gallery since 1956.

09:37.106 --> 09:39.311
She said the painting
was an irreplaceable treasure,

09:39.316 --> 09:41.263
but the Gallery had
simply not been...

09:41.268 --> 09:42.856
able to match
the overseas bid.

09:42.861 --> 09:45.029
We agreed on 900.

09:46.782 --> 09:48.868
900,000 or I keep it.

09:51.036 --> 09:53.288
All right, fine,
you asked for it.

09:53.371 --> 09:55.457
I'm keeping it.

10:13.309 --> 10:15.394
Hey, calm down.
Calm down.

10:16.268 --> 10:17.724
I was joking.

10:17.729 --> 10:19.814
I was joking. Ooh.

10:31.284 --> 10:32.739
Perfect, Mr. Ferguson.

10:32.744 --> 10:35.369
without any question.

10:35.454 --> 10:36.617
without a shadow of a doubt.

10:36.623 --> 10:38.957
What did I tell you?

10:39.041 --> 10:40.329
It's breathtaking.

10:40.334 --> 10:42.749
I can't imagine
how you came to have it.

10:42.754 --> 10:43.640
Well, you'll have to...

10:43.645 --> 10:44.917
'cause I'm not
going to tell you.

10:44.922 --> 10:47.799
We may not know how,
but we certainly know why.

10:47.800 --> 10:49.885
Barney, the cash.

10:55.016 --> 10:57.558
800,000 pounds.

10:59.187 --> 11:00.558
We agreed 9.

11:00.563 --> 11:03.857
- We said 8.
- We said 9.

11:03.941 --> 11:05.604
- 8.
- 9.

11:05.609 --> 11:07.694
8.

11:08.238 --> 11:10.323
All right, 9.

11:12.741 --> 11:15.160
900,000, or I'm keeping it.

11:15.245 --> 11:16.407
- What?
- All right, I'll keep it.

11:16.412 --> 11:20.248
Put it back.

11:22.836 --> 11:24.921
One million.

11:26.922 --> 11:29.128
- You're out of your mind.
- All right, I'll keep it.

11:29.133 --> 11:31.218
Stop!

11:32.428 --> 11:34.300
My dear, I'm not a gangster.

11:34.305 --> 11:36.680
But I was in real
estate for 20 years.

11:36.685 --> 11:38.770
I stop at nothing.

11:40.019 --> 11:42.104
Calm down.

11:46.151 --> 11:48.236
I was joking.

11:51.155 --> 11:53.845
- Have that much cash with us?
- Yes, captain.

12:22.560 --> 12:27.523
So now... this jewel...

12:29.234 --> 12:30.802
the ultimate record...

12:30.807 --> 12:33.445
of one man's fearless
conversation...

12:33.529 --> 12:37.031
with his most profound self,
stays with me.

12:38.325 --> 12:39.442
And Mr. Zhirkova...

12:39.447 --> 12:41.407
goes home with a
very good fake.

12:41.412 --> 12:43.869
Which he'll enjoy just
as much 'cause...

12:43.874 --> 12:46.251
he actually can't
tell the difference.

12:46.291 --> 12:46.915
But I can.

12:46.920 --> 12:49.005
Got a nose for
this kind of thing.

12:51.339 --> 12:53.168
- You've got a--
- Huh?

12:53.173 --> 12:55.259
On your...

12:55.301 --> 12:57.387
What's he talking about?

13:08.731 --> 13:10.186
It's a fake.

13:10.191 --> 13:12.276
It can't be!

13:12.277 --> 13:14.362
It's a fake!

13:19.743 --> 13:21.281
Oh, yes.

13:21.286 --> 13:23.538
Look at the yellow here,
and you'll--

13:27.125 --> 13:29.210
She switched it.

13:30.295 --> 13:32.380
You don't say.

13:35.717 --> 13:39.302
Trois, deux, un...

13:49.355 --> 13:51.648
You have a new client.

13:51.733 --> 13:53.818
Look, there's
not a mark on it.

13:58.614 --> 14:00.778
Do you know how much trouble
I could get into?

14:00.783 --> 14:02.868
Yep, about this much.

14:09.374 --> 14:11.459
- Rose...
- What?

14:13.588 --> 14:15.210
Don't push your luck too far.

14:15.216 --> 14:17.632
What could happen to me?

14:46.496 --> 14:48.658
He got me with a hook...

14:48.663 --> 14:50.662
Those big bass notes...

14:50.667 --> 14:52.455
Thunder in my chest...

14:52.460 --> 14:55.210
Mm, stuck in my throat...

14:55.294 --> 14:57.379
Pulling me down...

14:57.422 --> 14:58.960
Like a rumble
in the ground...

14:58.965 --> 15:01.342
Crawls up from
the depths...

15:01.427 --> 15:03.512
with a deep down sound...

15:12.730 --> 15:14.393
Watch that man...

15:14.398 --> 15:16.774
See what's in his hands...

15:16.859 --> 15:18.729
Got no joy...

15:18.734 --> 15:20.819
He's a big bad boy

15:32.666 --> 15:34.578
Big bomb body...

15:34.584 --> 15:36.710
Lonely neck...

15:36.796 --> 15:38.708
Swear it was a woman...

15:38.713 --> 15:40.797
That he had in his grip...

15:40.798 --> 15:42.883
Big vibrations, yeah...

15:42.884 --> 15:44.923
Just one glance...

15:44.928 --> 15:47.180
He's gonna blow my mind...

15:47.264 --> 15:50.052
He's gonna make me wanna,
make me wanna, oh!

15:50.057 --> 15:51.972
Johnny got a boom boom...

15:51.977 --> 15:54.062
Johnny got a bam...

15:54.604 --> 15:56.939
She's completely
out of control.

15:57.191 --> 15:59.942
- Hi!
- Hello, sweetheart.

16:00.026 --> 16:02.778
- Just gonna change, all right?
- Be my guest.

16:13.164 --> 16:16.208
I know.
Just so hopeless...

16:18.087 --> 16:19.874
- See anything you like?
- Sorry?

16:19.879 --> 16:21.794
Oh, um...

16:21.800 --> 16:25.009
- A drink?
- Yeah...

16:25.093 --> 16:26.422
Uh... well...

16:26.428 --> 16:28.132
Bye, sweetheart!

16:28.137 --> 16:30.222
- Bye.
- Oh...

16:42.862 --> 16:44.816
Johnny got a boom boom...

16:44.822 --> 16:46.907
Johnny got a bam

16:46.947 --> 16:49.033
At last.

16:52.788 --> 16:54.873
Shit.

16:56.499 --> 16:58.585
- All right?
- Mm-hm.

16:59.002 --> 17:00.582
Room 27.

17:00.587 --> 17:02.673
I know.
I remembered.

17:04.132 --> 17:05.627
You've got no messages.

17:05.633 --> 17:08.511
- That's the way I like it.
- Solitary type, huh?

17:10.554 --> 17:12.386
Well, there's a buzzer
by the side of the bed...

17:12.391 --> 17:14.477
if you, uh, change your mind...

17:17.980 --> 17:20.064
What do you weigh?

17:38.041 --> 17:40.126
Yes.

18:15.202 --> 18:17.287
No.

19:48.044 --> 19:50.712
You've committed
the ultimate sin, Victor.

19:50.797 --> 19:53.048
- Mother...
- Oh, don't 'mother' me.

19:53.132 --> 19:55.337
You must win back
your employer's trust.

19:55.342 --> 19:58.761
Your reputation depends on it.
The family reputation.

19:58.845 --> 19:59.967
Yes, mother.

19:59.972 --> 20:02.412
They'll have hired
a competitor by now.

20:03.267 --> 20:05.348
Someone better or
younger than you.

20:05.353 --> 20:07.687
I suppose that's right.

20:07.772 --> 20:09.939
So what do you
think I should do?

20:10.024 --> 20:10.367
Well,

20:10.372 --> 20:13.068
there's only one
thing you can do --...

20:13.152 --> 20:14.599
apologize to the client,

20:14.604 --> 20:16.776
tell him you'll do
the hit for free,

20:16.781 --> 20:18.866
Kill her and return the money.

20:59.657 --> 21:01.612
- Get in the car.
- You killed him!

21:01.618 --> 21:02.904
I had to.
He was going to kill you.

21:02.909 --> 21:04.995
- Oh, okay. Get in the car.
- Keys.

21:08.165 --> 21:10.250
Quickly!

21:13.796 --> 21:15.526
I can't believe they
hired someone...

21:15.531 --> 21:16.043
to kill me.

21:16.048 --> 21:17.961
What am I doing?
What am I doing?

21:17.966 --> 21:20.051
You tell me! Start the car!

21:21.513 --> 21:23.598
Freeze.

21:24.431 --> 21:27.099
Barney? Barney!

21:28.895 --> 21:31.312
Don't tell me.

21:31.398 --> 21:33.483
Out. Now.

21:36.861 --> 21:38.946
Stop!

21:43.951 --> 21:45.697
Face the wall.

21:45.702 --> 21:47.787
Both of you.

22:10.311 --> 22:11.932
Oh, my God.
What have I done?

22:11.937 --> 22:14.022
Who are you?

22:14.523 --> 22:16.608
Who are you?!

22:16.650 --> 22:19.067
You don't know each other?

22:19.152 --> 22:21.442
I was cleaning cars.
I picked up his gun!

22:21.447 --> 22:23.762
I've never even
touched a gun before.

22:24.282 --> 22:26.701
You were going to shoot him,
him and...

22:27.744 --> 22:28.989
Oh my God, is she--

22:28.995 --> 22:30.762
She's fine. She fainted.

22:30.767 --> 22:33.123
You've never fired
a gun before?

22:33.208 --> 22:35.959
Well, just give it to me now.

22:36.042 --> 22:38.128
- Don't.
- Why?

22:38.130 --> 22:40.380
- He'll shoot you.
- I will not.

22:40.465 --> 22:42.967
You saved my life.
Why would I shoot you?

22:44.303 --> 22:46.388
Don't.

22:48.723 --> 22:51.052
Just lay it down then
where he can't get it.

22:51.058 --> 22:53.143
Before someone gets hurt.

22:54.312 --> 22:57.311
Sorry, I'm going
to give it to him.

22:57.316 --> 22:58.936
He's got a tie on.

22:58.942 --> 22:59.745
Plus I didn't shoot him,

22:59.751 --> 23:00.856
so he's not so
pissed off with me.

23:00.861 --> 23:03.237
I'm not pissed off with you.
Honestly.

23:08.452 --> 23:10.910
Good boy.
Well done. Well done.

23:12.580 --> 23:14.666
Told you.

23:17.419 --> 23:19.706
You know, that was a pretty
good shot for a novice.

23:19.712 --> 23:22.376
- You didn't kill him, but--
- Didn't wanna kill him!

23:22.382 --> 23:24.759
Well no, no, of course not.

23:24.842 --> 23:28.201
I mean... I'm really
upset about it.

23:28.207 --> 23:29.217
Shaking...

23:29.222 --> 23:31.307
Well, that's very
understandable.

23:32.392 --> 23:33.595
Do you know what,
when I did it,

23:33.600 --> 23:34.764
I was completely
calm about it.

23:34.770 --> 23:37.265
It was like I had
all the time in the world...

23:37.271 --> 23:39.356
Ha.

23:40.733 --> 23:42.818
Excuse me.

23:44.404 --> 23:45.983
Oh!

23:45.989 --> 23:48.074
God...

23:50.117 --> 23:51.822
- What happened?
- He's not dead.

23:51.827 --> 23:53.991
I shot him.
I had to, he was gonna--

23:53.997 --> 23:55.371
The boy had no choice.

23:55.376 --> 23:57.628
Now we need to get
him out of sight.

23:59.669 --> 24:01.666
- Are you gonna kill him?
- No. Of course not.

24:01.671 --> 24:04.924
- You killed the other one.
- We're not gonna kill him.

24:06.634 --> 24:08.088
- We have to kill him.
- What?

24:08.093 --> 24:08.653
He's seen us.

24:08.658 --> 24:10.341
If we let him go,
we're as good as dead.

24:10.346 --> 24:11.967
Can't we just go the police?

24:11.973 --> 24:13.719
The police can't protect you
from people like this.

24:13.724 --> 24:15.976
We've no choice.
We'll do it quietly.

24:16.770 --> 24:18.855
No, stop!

24:21.107 --> 24:23.483
You're right.
What was I thinking?

24:23.568 --> 24:25.356
Probably be a while
before he comes round.

24:25.361 --> 24:27.149
- Long enough to get away.
- Exactly.

24:27.155 --> 24:29.069
- Let's get going, then.
- Hey, I'm gone.

24:29.074 --> 24:30.152
And don't go home.

24:30.157 --> 24:32.112
Be sure to go somewhere busy
so you're not followed.

24:32.117 --> 24:33.740
Who are you?

24:33.745 --> 24:35.241
Doesn't matter.

24:35.246 --> 24:37.330
Are you undercover?

24:43.503 --> 24:44.791
What are you doing?

24:44.796 --> 24:47.544
I'm getting scared out there.
Where's the kid?

24:47.549 --> 24:49.635
- He ran off.
- Um...

24:50.761 --> 24:54.429
I don't know who you are,
but can I trust you?

24:54.514 --> 24:56.599
Trust me?

24:57.976 --> 25:00.519
What happened here
was not random.

25:00.603 --> 25:02.730
His boss wants me dead.

25:02.814 --> 25:05.395
I only hope it's quick
when it happens, you know?

25:05.400 --> 25:07.610
Like with him, I mean...

25:07.693 --> 25:10.019
I mean, I almost wish
that it would...

25:10.024 --> 25:11.693
just happen now, you know?

25:11.699 --> 25:13.487
So I wouldn't...

25:13.492 --> 25:16.869
So I wouldn't have to
keep wondering when...

25:18.622 --> 25:20.707
Oh, God.

25:21.208 --> 25:23.583
- I need to pee.
- Right.

25:23.667 --> 25:26.295
- Right.
- I think it's just nerves.

25:29.466 --> 25:31.551
Do you have a tissue?

25:41.395 --> 25:43.480
Ooh, silk. Nice.

25:52.446 --> 25:54.532
Here you go.

25:56.285 --> 25:57.947
Um...

25:57.952 --> 26:01.871
Oh, God, they can't kill me
for less than a million!

26:01.956 --> 26:03.959
I mean, it's nothing
to them, you know?

26:03.964 --> 26:05.247
And I didn't hurt anyone.

26:05.252 --> 26:05.813
I mean,

26:05.818 --> 26:08.795
why do people have
to be so gullible?

26:18.597 --> 26:20.554
Hey, wait!
Where are you going?!

26:20.559 --> 26:23.143
I need protection!
You know how to shoot!

26:23.227 --> 26:25.728
I can--I can pay you.

26:25.814 --> 26:28.019
I can give you a down payment
right now!

26:28.024 --> 26:30.343
And there's loads
more in my bag.

26:30.348 --> 26:31.480
Please? Please?

26:31.486 --> 26:33.274
It's no good.
I can't help you.

26:33.279 --> 26:35.360
But you can't
abandon me like this.

26:35.365 --> 26:39.075
I mean, you're--
you're too kind for that.

26:39.160 --> 26:42.121
Please, I'm begging you.

26:42.206 --> 26:45.370
I'm sorry, I'm in no position
to protect you, believe me.

26:45.375 --> 26:48.209
I feel safe with you.

26:48.586 --> 26:51.214
You're wise and
calm and steady.

26:51.298 --> 26:54.341
You're like a
mighty ancient oak.

27:17.906 --> 27:20.156
Half now. Half later.

27:29.210 --> 27:30.623
Do you want me to drive?
You seem a little--

27:30.629 --> 27:32.714
I'm upset.

27:33.796 --> 27:35.543
These are in the way.

27:35.549 --> 27:37.504
You stole his boots?

27:37.510 --> 27:38.921
He doesn't need them anymore,
does he?

27:38.926 --> 27:40.382
Shit!

27:42.180 --> 27:44.349
How come you have a gun?

27:44.432 --> 27:46.976
Oh--that's--that's for work.

27:47.061 --> 27:48.223
What work?

27:48.228 --> 27:50.603
I'm an undercover
private detective.

27:50.688 --> 27:53.155
You just don't look
like the type.

27:53.161 --> 27:55.246
What were you doing in here?

27:55.277 --> 27:57.903
I was watching
a client's wife.

27:57.988 --> 27:59.995
She had a tryst in a--in--...

28:00.000 --> 28:02.700
with a man in a car
on the fifth floor.

28:04.661 --> 28:08.540
I've given you a down payment.
How much for the week?

28:08.624 --> 28:10.957
A week?
I'm too expensive.

28:11.043 --> 28:13.502
- How much?
- 30 thousand.

28:13.586 --> 28:16.293
All right, 30 thou.
I'm gonna get out of here.

28:16.299 --> 28:19.258
I want round-the-clock
protection.

28:19.342 --> 28:21.427
I'm sorry, no.

28:23.221 --> 28:24.884
Get down!

28:24.889 --> 28:27.929
- Quick! Back up, run him over!
- You must be kidding!

28:27.935 --> 28:30.769
Agh! Ow!

28:32.690 --> 28:34.311
- Hang on!
- He's fine!

28:34.316 --> 28:36.902
What are you doing? ! Get in!

28:38.654 --> 28:40.275
Get in! Get in!

28:40.280 --> 28:42.532
I can't see!

28:44.076 --> 28:45.739
I just saved your life!
You almost killed me!

28:45.744 --> 28:48.245
So we're quits. Oh shit! Shit!

28:48.331 --> 28:49.367
- Floor it!
- What?!

28:49.372 --> 28:51.457
Now!!

28:55.629 --> 28:57.714
Oh, my god!

29:00.842 --> 29:02.005
Where now?

29:02.010 --> 29:04.007
Third street on the right.
We'll get across town.

29:04.012 --> 29:05.092
- Well, then what?

29:05.097 --> 29:07.452
A discreet hotel.
We need to lie low.

29:11.603 --> 29:12.282
Discreet?

29:12.287 --> 29:14.856
How about ridiculously
overpriced?

29:14.939 --> 29:17.377
They'll be checking
the cheaper hotels.

29:17.382 --> 29:19.467
No one will look for us here.

29:23.574 --> 29:25.659
Three...

29:26.576 --> 29:28.490
Three rooms, please.

29:28.496 --> 29:30.662
Of course, sir.
What name?

29:30.747 --> 29:34.582
Smith.

29:34.667 --> 29:37.586
You have the same name?

29:37.669 --> 29:40.046
- And your name, sir?
- Tony.

29:40.131 --> 29:42.216
We'll just take the one room.

29:43.675 --> 29:45.172
Excuse me.

29:45.177 --> 29:47.262
What? Ow.

29:48.097 --> 29:50.427
- You can't be serious.
- Who's paying for this?

29:50.432 --> 29:51.566
- You said you had
plenty of money.

29:51.571 --> 29:52.804
Yeah, and I mean to
keep it that way.

29:52.809 --> 29:54.132
I'm sorry, I really
can't sleep...

29:54.138 --> 29:55.266
in a room with someone else.

29:55.271 --> 29:56.850
Well, I can't imagine
you get many requests.

29:56.856 --> 29:58.040
- I'll pay for my own room.

29:58.045 --> 29:59.686
It's not about the
money, all right?

29:59.691 --> 30:01.563
Round-the-clock
protection, we said.

30:01.568 --> 30:02.626
How are you going
to protect me...

30:02.632 --> 30:03.315
from another room? No.

30:03.321 --> 30:03.784
- Wait!

30:03.789 --> 30:06.114
No. One room. One room's fine.

30:06.197 --> 30:08.687
Why don't you
settle this in 322?

30:08.692 --> 30:10.656
It's one of our cheapest.

30:10.661 --> 30:12.829
Are you sure this
is a safe place?

30:12.914 --> 30:15.729
Of course I'm sure.
I leave nothing to chance.

30:17.835 --> 30:20.045
- Ah, Laetitia.
- Good morning, boss.

30:20.129 --> 30:22.944
- Have you seen Mike?
- Sorry, Mr. Ferguson, no.

30:30.931 --> 30:33.016
- Thank you, sir.
- Mmm.

30:33.060 --> 30:34.805
- May I say...
- Oh, here we go...

30:34.811 --> 30:35.900
It would help if you
could manage...

30:35.905 --> 30:37.057
to behave with a
little more decorum.

30:37.062 --> 30:38.183
Hey, they have cable.

30:38.188 --> 30:39.348
Three adults in one room,

30:39.353 --> 30:40.977
a miniscule room
in a luxury hotel?

30:40.983 --> 30:43.022
- So what?
- So you got us noticed!

30:43.562 --> 30:44.934
Already the home
team's defence...

30:44.939 --> 30:46.357
is looking rather
nervous, Andy.

30:46.362 --> 30:48.361
What do you think?

30:48.366 --> 30:50.537
Tempers getting a
bit out of control...

30:50.542 --> 30:51.654
in the early stages.

30:51.660 --> 30:53.407
Outside coming
forward again...

30:53.412 --> 30:55.660
with killers after you,
you're discreet.

30:55.665 --> 30:56.477
You hide.

30:56.482 --> 30:59.376
You don't yell in
hotel lobbies.

30:59.460 --> 31:02.670
Oh, that's a beautiful move.

31:02.755 --> 31:05.394
Putting together
a few passes now.

31:05.400 --> 31:07.485
That's it!

31:08.803 --> 31:10.888
Oh, and he puts it wide!

31:10.972 --> 31:13.682
My goodness,
he'll be kicking himself.

31:13.766 --> 31:15.934
Which side do you sleep on?

31:16.017 --> 31:17.305
What?

31:17.310 --> 31:20.063
I don't. I keep watch.

31:20.147 --> 31:22.940
Tony, you sleep with her.

31:23.024 --> 31:24.730
Whatever.

31:24.735 --> 31:26.061
While we're here,

31:26.067 --> 31:28.487
please respect
my living space.

31:28.572 --> 31:31.991
This... is my area.

31:32.075 --> 31:34.828
Time's just going to fly by,
I can tell.

31:34.912 --> 31:36.742
Now just you change your tune,
young lady.

31:36.748 --> 31:38.576
You were a lot less lippy
in the car-park,

31:38.582 --> 31:40.036
sobbing about ancient oaks.

31:40.041 --> 31:41.751
- I didn't beg you
to come, remember.

31:41.756 --> 31:42.372
I didn't beg.

31:42.378 --> 31:44.584
Offering a man 30,000 pounds
to spend a week with you...

31:44.589 --> 31:46.292
is scarcely playing
hard-to-get.

31:46.298 --> 31:46.875
Incredible,

31:46.880 --> 31:48.880
I have only known
you for three hours,

31:48.885 --> 31:50.672
and already it would take me
three days...

31:50.677 --> 31:53.133
to list everything
that I hate about you.

31:56.015 --> 31:59.644
Oh dear, oh dear!
Six yards out.

31:59.728 --> 32:02.603
Perhaps he should have done
better than that.

32:08.611 --> 32:10.525
Are you sure you won't come?

32:10.530 --> 32:11.742
It's been a long day.

32:11.747 --> 32:13.653
I just want some
peace and quiet.

32:15.076 --> 32:17.327
I'll be in the bar.
Don't be long.

32:23.543 --> 32:25.752
One thing though, Mr. Smith.

32:25.836 --> 32:26.245
- Yeah?

32:26.250 --> 32:28.713
Did I hear you say
she's paying you?

32:28.798 --> 32:32.008
- You did.
- I haven't got any money.

32:32.093 --> 32:34.632
Don't worry.
I'll look after you for free.

32:34.638 --> 32:36.723
In fact...

32:38.266 --> 32:39.845
you can help me
look after her.

32:39.850 --> 32:42.665
Great, probably need
all the help you can get.

32:45.940 --> 32:48.025
So I'll be your assistant?

32:49.359 --> 32:51.445
Apprentice.

32:53.906 --> 32:58.117
You know, Tony,
you're a fine young man.

33:02.331 --> 33:04.417
Um...

33:05.710 --> 33:08.420
That's all.

33:14.844 --> 33:16.883
There you are.

33:16.888 --> 33:19.703
I was wondering
what the two of you were up to.

33:21.309 --> 33:26.855
I'm sorry, before,
I was unpleasant and--...

33:27.982 --> 33:29.436
and hostile even.

33:29.441 --> 33:31.064
I'm not usually like that.

33:31.069 --> 33:32.772
Oh, don't worry.

33:32.778 --> 33:35.822
I was aggressive
and annoying and, um,

33:35.907 --> 33:37.993
I'm quite often like that.

33:39.869 --> 33:42.370
No. You can be pleasant.

33:42.455 --> 33:43.909
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:43.914 --> 33:46.000
When?

33:47.502 --> 33:49.539
I can't think
of an example right now but...

33:49.544 --> 33:51.629
Great. Thank you.

33:55.259 --> 33:59.138
Now.
Now you're being pleasant.

34:02.392 --> 34:03.513
You're not listening.

34:03.518 --> 34:05.603
I am.

34:06.395 --> 34:07.975
What were you were saying?

34:07.980 --> 34:09.542
I was saying you were pleasant...

34:09.547 --> 34:11.061
then for seven or
eight seconds.

34:11.065 --> 34:13.484
You're eyeing up the barman.

34:13.568 --> 34:16.946
Yeah. He fancies me.
Is that bothering you?

34:17.032 --> 34:18.318
As a matter of fact.

34:18.322 --> 34:21.033
Why? Do you fancy me?

34:21.118 --> 34:21.504
- What?

34:21.510 --> 34:23.532
It's a simple enough question.

34:23.536 --> 34:25.996
Of course not.
Not at all.

34:26.080 --> 34:28.165
Okay, that's what I thought.

34:34.422 --> 34:37.632
Do you fancy him?
Is that it?

34:39.052 --> 34:39.889
No, it is not,

34:39.893 --> 34:42.050
I would simply like
you to listen...

34:42.056 --> 34:43.427
if we’re having a conversation,
that's all.

34:43.431 --> 34:45.661
I couldn't care less
if you have it away...

34:45.666 --> 34:46.514
with the barman,

34:46.518 --> 34:48.263
the bellboy and all
the other customers...

34:48.268 --> 34:48.848
if you want to.

34:48.853 --> 34:51.793
- It's none of my business.
- You're unbelievable.

34:54.734 --> 35:00.049
Hi, um, can I have
a large Glenfiddich,

35:00.055 --> 35:01.903
and a cognac,

35:01.908 --> 35:05.911
and a Belvedere, and a Becks,

35:05.994 --> 35:07.993
and two small red wines
and some peanuts.

35:07.998 --> 35:09.494
Not all for you.

35:09.499 --> 35:13.168
No, the Becks is for you.
And my father will pay.

35:30.686 --> 35:32.772
What do you weigh?

35:44.993 --> 35:47.078
You know, Mike?

35:48.038 --> 35:51.289
You are the only genuine one
in all this.

35:53.334 --> 35:55.586
Genuine asshole.

35:55.670 --> 35:57.922
It's not my fault.

35:58.006 --> 36:00.043
Not your fault?

36:00.048 --> 36:02.171
You said not to hire
another hit man.

36:02.176 --> 36:04.298
You said you'd handle
it with Barney.

36:04.303 --> 36:09.267
And now I'm left
with one bodyguard.

36:10.144 --> 36:11.805
The incompetent fat one.

36:11.811 --> 36:13.641
Stop shaking.

36:13.647 --> 36:15.434
Oh, stop shaking!

36:15.439 --> 36:17.167
Why are you shaking?

36:17.173 --> 36:20.027
You think I'm
angry with you, hm?

36:20.904 --> 36:24.089
Do you think that
I'm going to hit you?

36:24.094 --> 36:25.069
Is that it?

36:25.074 --> 36:27.535
It's funny.

36:27.619 --> 36:31.168
Truth is, tonight I
feel more like tears...

36:31.173 --> 36:33.258
than anger.

36:33.375 --> 36:35.502
You understand
we've lost her now.

36:37.754 --> 36:41.381
The vixen will have
gone to ground.

36:41.466 --> 36:44.968
Our chances of finding her
are next to nil.

36:47.847 --> 36:51.558
No, tonight...

36:51.641 --> 36:53.726
I am sad.

36:56.313 --> 36:58.398
You're sad, too.

37:04.905 --> 37:06.842
I don't like to
see sad people.

37:06.847 --> 37:08.932
Go to the bathroom.

37:21.796 --> 37:23.669
You just stay away from me.

37:23.674 --> 37:25.127
You ruined my evening.

37:25.133 --> 37:27.677
- Really.
- I was making friends.

37:27.760 --> 37:29.799
You were making a spectacle of
yourself.

37:29.804 --> 37:31.929
Do you have any
friends, I wonder?

37:31.934 --> 37:34.020
No, I can't imagine
that you do.

37:35.644 --> 37:38.437
Sorry.
Sorry, wrong room.

37:38.521 --> 37:40.607
No problem.

37:46.946 --> 37:49.699
Why are you always in the way?

37:52.828 --> 37:55.246
- I fell asleep.
- That's all right.

37:55.330 --> 37:58.708
Of course, everything he does
is all right, isn't it?

37:58.792 --> 38:01.043
Hey, you scuffed those boots!

38:01.128 --> 38:02.874
Ignore her, she's drunk.

38:02.879 --> 38:04.429
Still, my reactions
will be quicker...

38:04.435 --> 38:05.085
now I've rested.

38:05.090 --> 38:08.968
In case anything happens,
I can stay up with you.

38:09.052 --> 38:10.642
- We can take it in turns.

38:10.647 --> 38:12.732
Fantastic, the two musketeers.

38:15.350 --> 38:17.435
Hey, what are you doing?

38:18.310 --> 38:19.838
- Putting them out
to be cleaned.

38:19.843 --> 38:20.893
Someone'll steal them.

38:20.898 --> 38:22.983
God,
you're not in the YMCA now.

38:37.830 --> 38:39.915
And don't you try anything.

39:21.458 --> 39:23.835
Right, who's going to take
the first...

39:25.336 --> 39:27.421
watch.

39:54.281 --> 39:56.027
Boss?

39:56.033 --> 39:57.738
What? He's here.

39:57.743 --> 39:58.947
Good.

39:58.952 --> 40:01.622
Tell him to wait.
Shan't be long.

40:03.749 --> 40:05.834
Do you want anything?

40:07.795 --> 40:09.665
Just some coffee.

40:09.670 --> 40:11.756
Can we just go?

40:14.885 --> 40:17.388
Would you please
let me go first?

40:22.685 --> 40:24.770
- All clear.
- You don't say.

40:27.856 --> 40:30.233
So it's a quite
extraordinary story.

40:30.317 --> 40:34.987
The man I hired to do the job
kills one of my men,

40:35.071 --> 40:37.122
grotesquely maims another,

40:37.128 --> 40:39.575
and is now
protecting the girl.

40:41.203 --> 40:41.988
Needless to say,

40:41.993 --> 40:43.617
you're to get rid
of both of them.

40:43.622 --> 40:45.161
Should've called me sooner.

40:45.166 --> 40:47.458
We tried to handle
it ourselves.

40:47.543 --> 40:50.419
- They killed Barney!

40:50.503 --> 40:52.588
Mike...

40:53.090 --> 40:57.260
I can't look at you right now.
Go and buy me some cigarettes.

40:59.970 --> 41:02.056
Would you feed our meter?

41:02.725 --> 41:04.810
Feed your own sodding meter.

41:05.811 --> 41:07.355
And the name of this man...

41:07.360 --> 41:09.476
who has caused you
so much trouble?

41:09.481 --> 41:11.900
I don't know his name.
We never met.

41:11.984 --> 41:15.110
Can you tell me anything
about him at all?

41:15.195 --> 41:16.859
Mike saw him.

41:16.864 --> 41:19.157
Describe him.

41:19.240 --> 41:21.492
Taller than average.

41:21.577 --> 41:24.037
Thinner than average,
average looks.

41:24.121 --> 41:25.783
Average moustache.

41:25.789 --> 41:28.041
Victor Maynard.

41:28.124 --> 41:30.334
You know him?
You know where he is?

41:30.418 --> 41:32.166
No, no one knows him.

41:32.171 --> 41:34.210
No one ever sees him,
not even his clients.

41:34.215 --> 41:35.711
He's old-school.

41:35.716 --> 41:38.155
So how come
you know what he looks like?

41:39.885 --> 41:41.925
- Rumor.
- Oh.

41:41.930 --> 41:45.431
In our line, we're--
how can I put this?

41:45.515 --> 41:47.892
The two most expensive.

41:47.978 --> 41:50.186
Actually, uh...

41:50.270 --> 41:52.320
he's a little bit
more expensive...

41:52.325 --> 41:54.410
then you are.

41:57.320 --> 41:59.822
We'll find out if he's
worth it at last.

42:19.009 --> 42:22.301
Help yourself.
Anything but the sausage.

42:22.387 --> 42:24.472
Such largesse.

42:25.431 --> 42:28.218
Why don't you just
settle the bill?

42:28.223 --> 42:29.096
All right?

42:29.101 --> 42:31.129
Because if I don't
get a minute...

42:31.134 --> 42:33.219
without you, I
will kill myself.

43:11.601 --> 43:13.687
Hey, what the--

43:26.910 --> 43:29.623
Wait, please, I didn't
mean to hurt you.

43:29.629 --> 43:31.714
It was just good luck.

43:45.928 --> 43:48.013
Freeze!
Put your hands up.

43:49.307 --> 43:51.053
Shit! Shit!

43:51.059 --> 43:53.643
You're shaking like a leaf.

43:53.728 --> 43:55.182
Give me the gun.

43:55.187 --> 43:57.752
I'm serious!
You know I'm a terrible shot.

43:57.773 --> 43:59.552
I could easily aim
at your head...

43:59.558 --> 44:00.813
and blow your balls off.

44:00.818 --> 44:03.610
- You tried to drown me.
- Only a bit.

44:03.695 --> 44:05.942
I'm an ordinary, kind,
peaceful person...

44:05.948 --> 44:07.318
Just calm down.

44:07.323 --> 44:10.408
- Take a deep breath.
- I am calm!

44:10.493 --> 44:13.955
Agh! Aah! Aah...

44:14.039 --> 44:17.040
That was an accident!
You frightened me!

44:20.629 --> 44:22.458
Try and find your ear.

44:22.463 --> 44:23.649
Put it on some ice,

44:23.655 --> 44:26.094
and the hospital can
stitch it back on.

44:29.429 --> 44:31.515
There's some ice
in the mini-bar.

44:37.895 --> 44:39.267
Quick! Run!

44:39.272 --> 44:43.066
What? Shit. Shit!

44:43.151 --> 44:46.069
Didn't even get a bathrobe.

44:46.154 --> 44:49.572
Ah, yes,
Smith, Smith and... Tony.

44:49.657 --> 44:51.825
He tried to kill me!

44:51.910 --> 44:53.996
In the bathroom
with a big gun!

44:56.080 --> 45:00.752
Wait! Wait!

45:00.835 --> 45:04.045
My ear!
You sick bastard!

45:04.129 --> 45:06.507
- Put it on ice!
- Move!

45:07.842 --> 45:10.782
- What, you shot his ear off?
- It was an accident.

45:15.099 --> 45:16.305
Get the case!

45:16.310 --> 45:17.596
Make sure you get them.

45:17.602 --> 45:19.979
You got a professional
on the case now.

45:23.691 --> 45:25.396
Mike!
What are you doing?

45:25.401 --> 45:27.398
The girl,
the moustache,

45:27.403 --> 45:30.073
They were here all the time
in the hotel!

45:30.157 --> 45:32.242
The kid blew my ear off!

45:33.659 --> 45:35.406
The Mini!

45:35.411 --> 45:37.538
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Get the car.

45:38.581 --> 45:40.244
Get the car!!

45:40.249 --> 45:42.667
He just frightened me, so I...

45:42.752 --> 45:44.916
- You did what you had to do.
- Did I?

45:44.921 --> 45:47.486
Of course, yeah,
because you're a natural.

45:53.847 --> 45:55.801
- They're following.
- Faster.

45:55.807 --> 45:58.558
- I can't go any faster.
- Drive faster!

45:58.641 --> 46:00.056
I'm doing my best.

46:00.061 --> 46:01.474
I'm still trying
to get the hang of the car.

46:01.479 --> 46:02.850
- It's a new car?
- Well, new to me.

46:02.855 --> 46:04.282
Found it at a petrol
station yesterday,

46:04.287 --> 46:05.018
keys and everything.

46:05.023 --> 46:06.937
- Talk about luck.
- It's stolen?!

46:06.942 --> 46:09.277
- Yes!
- They're gaining on us.

46:10.364 --> 46:12.572
Right. Here.
Change places.

46:12.657 --> 46:14.527
I'll put my feet on the pedals
and slide under you.

46:14.532 --> 46:16.617
Oh, God. Ooh!

46:20.706 --> 46:22.786
Could you please move!
I can't see a thing!

46:22.792 --> 46:24.637
Well, you seem to be getting...

46:24.642 --> 46:26.727
a pretty good feel
of everything.

46:51.028 --> 46:53.113
Ah! Ah!

47:08.878 --> 47:10.964
Oh, my God!

47:11.882 --> 47:14.632
- There's a baby!
- Keep going. We're bigger.

47:18.806 --> 47:19.967
Look out!

47:30.024 --> 47:32.105
- I think we've lost them.
- Oh, you're not sure?

47:32.110 --> 47:33.377
- D'you want the
sitting duck seat?!

47:33.382 --> 47:34.191
No, I'd rather you did!

47:34.196 --> 47:36.281
Stop bickering!

47:40.994 --> 47:43.241
- Where are we going?
- We need to get out of town.

47:43.246 --> 47:44.575
No, I like town!

47:44.580 --> 47:46.127
Me too, but I've never tried...

47:46.133 --> 47:47.830
anything else, so
I'm pretty open.

47:47.835 --> 47:49.872
Look, we're driving
a bullet-strafed stolen car...

47:49.878 --> 47:51.959
that's just been involved
in a high-speed chase.

47:51.964 --> 47:52.945
We're being pursued...

47:52.950 --> 47:54.335
by hired assassins
and, by now,

47:54.340 --> 47:56.964
I imagine every half-witted
police officer in East London.

47:56.969 --> 47:59.054
We're getting out of town!

48:00.054 --> 48:01.676
Did you bring a tent?

48:01.682 --> 48:03.871
I have a safe place.
We'll go there.

48:03.892 --> 48:05.977
Is it as safe as the hotel?

48:06.603 --> 48:09.105
- I'm ignoring that.
- 'I'm ignoring that.'

48:09.815 --> 48:11.900
Ow!

48:17.865 --> 48:19.444
- Can we stop?
- No.

48:19.449 --> 48:21.446
- I need to pee.
- We're not stopping.

48:21.451 --> 48:23.864
I pay you 30,000 a week.
You do as I say.

48:23.870 --> 48:26.201
- The next service station.
- I'm paid to protect you.

48:26.206 --> 48:27.745
Mostly, it seems,
from yourself.

48:27.750 --> 48:29.835
- 30,000 pounds?
- Yeah, exactly!

48:29.918 --> 48:31.691
I should be able to
pee sitting down...

48:31.696 --> 48:32.331
at that price.

48:32.336 --> 48:35.339
Oh...

48:54.691 --> 48:58.862
Mr. Smith, 30,000?
That's pretty good money.

48:58.946 --> 49:00.816
Yes, it is.

49:00.822 --> 49:02.861
I mean,
I know it's dangerous.

49:02.866 --> 49:04.125
But I seem to be
getting the hang...

49:04.131 --> 49:04.864
of that side of things.

49:04.869 --> 49:07.119
So me being your apprentice,

49:07.203 --> 49:10.075
I thought we could put that
on a more formal footing?

49:10.081 --> 49:12.166
So I could get a cut?

49:15.129 --> 49:18.339
Okay, here's the... thing.

49:18.423 --> 49:21.504
I can offer you six
weeks' training,

49:21.509 --> 49:23.298
suspect observation,

49:23.304 --> 49:24.279
fake identities,

49:24.285 --> 49:26.301
a complete range
of weapon skills:

49:26.306 --> 49:29.684
handguns, sniper rifles,
knives, explosives,

49:29.769 --> 49:32.734
the 17 methods of
strangulation...

49:32.739 --> 49:35.356
and basic untraceable poisons.

49:35.441 --> 49:37.395
You need to know all that
to be a private detective?

49:37.400 --> 49:40.778
You never know who
you might be up against.

49:42.030 --> 49:43.611
Okay. Go on.

49:43.616 --> 49:46.066
Well, I can't offer
you health cover...

49:46.071 --> 49:47.405
or a pension scheme,

49:47.410 --> 49:49.157
but bed, board and laundry
would be covered...

49:49.163 --> 49:52.289
as would a travel card
for the Greater London area.

49:52.290 --> 49:54.375
You'd take care of me?

49:56.086 --> 49:58.171
Y-yes.

49:59.966 --> 50:02.051
And my name...

50:03.510 --> 50:05.596
is Victor Maynard.

50:06.513 --> 50:08.093
Hey!

50:09.641 --> 50:12.768
Come on! Let's go!

50:12.853 --> 50:14.641
Shit.

50:14.646 --> 50:16.731
Hey!

50:17.357 --> 50:20.443
Hey! Hey get back here!

50:24.740 --> 50:26.903
The mark-up in that
place is criminal.

50:26.908 --> 50:28.561
Half the stuff's past
its sell-by date.

50:28.567 --> 50:29.740
I mean, what's his problem?

50:29.746 --> 50:31.658
Unbelievably irresponsible!

50:31.663 --> 50:33.576
Staggeringly immature!

50:33.581 --> 50:36.251
Staggeringly! Staggering!

50:36.335 --> 50:38.414
Fig roll, anyone?

50:43.133 --> 50:44.921
- I'll have one.
- Get lost.

50:44.927 --> 50:47.012
Not fair!
Mr. Maynard!

50:55.854 --> 50:57.980
I'm a new soul...

50:58.063 --> 51:00.316
I came to this
strange world...

51:00.402 --> 51:05.571
Hoping I could learn a bit
'bout how to give and take...

51:05.656 --> 51:07.527
But since I came here...

51:07.533 --> 51:09.950
Felt the joy
and the fear...

51:10.036 --> 51:15.081
Finding myself making
every possible mistake...

51:15.166 --> 51:20.928
La la la la la la
la la la la la la la...

51:20.933 --> 51:24.005
la la la la la la...

51:33.557 --> 51:35.643
Is that a cow?

51:39.020 --> 51:41.106
Much bigger in person.

51:49.614 --> 51:51.699
God, what is this?

51:53.410 --> 51:55.495
It's my home.

51:56.871 --> 51:58.117
Your home.

51:58.122 --> 52:00.208
What's so strange about that?

52:03.337 --> 52:05.964
No,
it all makes perfect sense.

52:08.383 --> 52:10.001
It was my grandfather's,

52:10.006 --> 52:12.095
my father's, and
now it's mine.

52:12.180 --> 52:13.549
Lift?

52:13.555 --> 52:15.512
That was installed
for my mother.

52:15.517 --> 52:18.642
She lived here with me
until quite recently.

52:18.728 --> 52:21.855
- Is she dead?
- No. Just infirm.

52:21.939 --> 52:25.150
- Are you close?
- Why do you ask?

52:25.235 --> 52:29.362
I was being nice.
What's the matter with you?

52:29.446 --> 52:31.824
Look what I found!

52:39.581 --> 52:41.667
Let me show you to your rooms.

52:45.463 --> 52:47.922
You take my old room.

52:48.008 --> 52:50.093
Thanks.

53:24.168 --> 53:27.211
Do you like that?
My father made it for me.

53:28.964 --> 53:30.709
He was good with his hands.

53:30.714 --> 53:33.339
I never had a father.
Well, I had one, obviously.

53:33.344 --> 53:36.659
But he didn't hang about.
Mind you, nor did my mother.

53:47.692 --> 53:50.776
- Is this your mother's room?
- That's right.

53:50.859 --> 53:55.045
Mm. Got a thing
about plastic covers,

53:55.050 --> 53:57.135
haven't you?

53:57.408 --> 53:59.494
I bet condoms
don't bother you.

54:08.336 --> 54:10.421
How is your assistant doing?

54:11.716 --> 54:13.236
- They want to turn him off.

54:13.241 --> 54:15.212
Perhaps that would
be for the best.

54:15.218 --> 54:18.679
No. He's been paid
till the end of the month.

54:20.432 --> 54:22.517
Anyway, he's company.

54:23.226 --> 54:25.311
While I'm waiting.

54:26.187 --> 54:27.433
For you.

54:27.439 --> 54:29.352
Don't worry.

54:29.357 --> 54:30.356
Sooner or later,

54:30.361 --> 54:32.550
one of them is gonna
make a mistake.

54:33.445 --> 54:35.497
Now we're safe here
as long as we...

54:35.502 --> 54:37.610
follow a few basic
rules of security:

54:37.615 --> 54:40.032
stay within the
house and grounds.

54:40.117 --> 54:42.055
Salt in the middle
of the table,

54:42.060 --> 54:44.145
please.

54:46.124 --> 54:48.209
And the mint sauce.

54:50.836 --> 54:51.485
Thank you.

54:51.490 --> 54:53.575
So no contact
with the outside.

54:53.590 --> 54:57.426
No phone calls either,
mobiles to be kept turned off.

54:58.637 --> 55:00.722
wine in the middle, too.

55:02.139 --> 55:05.393
If you wouldn't mind.
It's a light Burgundy.

55:07.228 --> 55:10.938
I particularly like wines
from Burgundy.

55:12.734 --> 55:14.942
So it's essentially a prison.

55:15.028 --> 55:16.588
No. It's a place of safety,

55:16.593 --> 55:18.441
and we want to
keep it that way.

55:18.447 --> 55:21.195
How long do you think before
all of this just blows over?

55:21.200 --> 55:23.531
You're being pursued
by professional killers.

55:23.536 --> 55:25.622
This will never blow over.

55:27.456 --> 55:30.417
Swiss action.
A gift from my mother.

55:59.323 --> 56:01.235
It's 2:45 AM.

56:01.240 --> 56:02.402
You think I don't know that?

56:02.408 --> 56:04.404
Could you please tell me
what you're doing?

56:04.409 --> 56:06.407
I'm turning the bed around
'cause I sleep facing south.

56:06.412 --> 56:09.289
- And--can you help me?
- Help you?!

56:09.373 --> 56:12.062
Well, insomnia,
it's extremely debilitating.

56:17.338 --> 56:19.424
There. Due south.

56:22.427 --> 56:24.636
Why didn't I think of that?

56:24.722 --> 56:25.775
- Those shoes...

56:25.780 --> 56:27.888
Yeah, they give me confidence.

56:29.227 --> 56:30.680
Come and see.

56:30.685 --> 56:33.645
Tony, who is young,
modern, eccentric even,

56:33.731 --> 56:39.443
but like everyone else
at 2:45 AM, he's asleep!

56:58.004 --> 57:00.089
No, she's the one we go after.

57:01.842 --> 57:03.756
Look at her--
accident waiting to happen.

57:03.761 --> 57:05.590
The boy is a nobody.

57:05.595 --> 57:06.996
As for Maynard, well,

57:07.001 --> 57:09.473
there's no point
going after Maynard.

57:11.643 --> 57:14.193
You won't find a
trace anywhere.

57:14.198 --> 57:16.283
Not a whisper.

57:17.606 --> 57:19.691
Hm.

57:19.734 --> 57:23.236
He is the ultimate
killing machine.

57:38.878 --> 57:40.332
What are you--
what are you doing?!

57:40.338 --> 57:42.423
- You're insane!
- I'm just digging.

57:42.424 --> 57:44.462
Put that pick down right now!
Stop it!

57:44.467 --> 57:46.548
I was gonna get
you some magnolias.

57:46.553 --> 57:48.924
It was supposed to be
a surprise for you.

57:48.929 --> 57:51.181
I got up at 6:00!

57:53.226 --> 57:55.222
I've never dug a hole
for anyone before!

57:55.228 --> 57:57.103
- What, and you had
to do it for me!?

57:57.108 --> 57:57.309
Yes!

57:57.314 --> 58:00.066
- Why?!
- 'Cause I wanted to thank you!

58:00.151 --> 58:02.901
For helping me get to sleep!

58:02.985 --> 58:05.232
Fill them back up
and put the turf on top now!

58:05.237 --> 58:08.574
- No!
- That was not a request!

58:08.658 --> 58:10.572
That was an instruction!

58:10.577 --> 58:12.656
Hey, hang on a second!

58:12.661 --> 58:15.289
You had no right!
That's my garden!

58:15.372 --> 58:18.291
As if you cared
about your garden!

58:18.376 --> 58:23.380
A garden is a place of beauty
where your senses run riot!

58:23.465 --> 58:25.378
What good is that to you?

58:25.383 --> 58:28.343
You shrink-wrap
your own furniture!

58:28.427 --> 58:31.686
You're only happy hiding away...

58:31.692 --> 58:34.850
inside this gloomy
awful house.

58:34.934 --> 58:37.060
God, it's horrible.

58:37.144 --> 58:40.938
It's like everywhere you go,
there's that smell.

58:41.023 --> 58:42.185
What smell?

58:42.190 --> 58:43.603
Cleanliness. Bleach.

58:43.608 --> 58:46.111
It's like being in a hospital.

58:46.195 --> 58:48.321
It's so safe, it's dangerous.

58:48.405 --> 58:50.402
I can't breathe here.

58:50.407 --> 58:53.408
I mean it.
I'm frightened.

58:56.372 --> 58:59.539
I'm frightened if I stay here
much longer,

58:59.624 --> 59:01.709
I'll end up like you.

59:02.753 --> 59:04.749
- Afraid of everything.
- I'm not afraid.

59:04.755 --> 59:06.839
Afraid of admitting who I am.

59:06.840 --> 59:08.925
What I want.

59:13.597 --> 59:15.682
What are you getting at?

59:19.770 --> 59:23.085
You really don't know anything
about yourself, do you?

01:00:14.657 --> 01:00:15.778
Yeah?

01:00:15.783 --> 01:00:18.244
It's me. Can I come in?

01:00:19.955 --> 01:00:21.200
I'm in my bath.

01:00:21.205 --> 01:00:23.244
I know.

01:00:23.249 --> 01:00:24.912
Is it important?

01:00:24.917 --> 01:00:26.707
I think so.

01:00:26.712 --> 01:00:28.797
Okay.

01:00:40.016 --> 01:00:41.639
All right?

01:00:41.644 --> 01:00:43.729
Yeah.

01:00:46.439 --> 01:00:48.524
Having a bath?

01:00:49.693 --> 01:00:51.147
Looks like it.

01:00:51.152 --> 01:00:54.279
Tony, just lately,

01:00:54.364 --> 01:00:58.033
well, I haven't really been
on top of things.

01:00:58.119 --> 01:01:00.570
I've been distracted at work,

01:01:00.575 --> 01:01:03.872
and I just over
trimmed my dwarf ulmus.

01:01:03.955 --> 01:01:07.209
My favourite bonsai tree.

01:01:07.292 --> 01:01:10.169
So I wondered...

01:01:10.253 --> 01:01:12.465
if it mightn't be you...

01:01:12.548 --> 01:01:14.504
Confusing me.

01:01:14.509 --> 01:01:16.420
Confusing you...

01:01:16.425 --> 01:01:19.219
Without meaning to.
Without realizing.

01:01:19.304 --> 01:01:21.431
Without either
of us realizing.

01:01:24.143 --> 01:01:26.229
Confusing you...

01:01:27.898 --> 01:01:29.983
Sexually.

01:01:30.441 --> 01:01:32.104
I see.

01:01:32.109 --> 01:01:34.439
- The idea's absurd, I know.
- I didn't even know you were--

01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:38.115
That's the thing.

01:01:38.158 --> 01:01:40.825
Oh. That is confusing.

01:01:40.909 --> 01:01:42.994
Y-yeah.

01:01:47.583 --> 01:01:49.750
Okay.

01:01:49.835 --> 01:01:52.754
- What's your first thought?
- My dwarf ulmus.

01:01:55.674 --> 01:01:58.530
I could graft it onto
the rubber plant.

01:01:58.535 --> 01:02:00.803
I won't disturb
you any longer.

01:02:06.686 --> 01:02:10.396
So now we all know
it's as fake as a ropa Rolex,

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:12.554
Mr. Ferguson would
like to know...

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:14.645
where the girl got it.

01:02:15.152 --> 01:02:18.488
I really don't mix
with the criminal fraternity.

01:02:18.572 --> 01:02:20.907
Please, even your
smile's crooked.

01:02:22.242 --> 01:02:24.369
Names.

01:02:24.453 --> 01:02:28.832
There are a great many people
who copy paintings.

01:02:28.916 --> 01:02:31.002
The ones I know didn't do it.

01:02:38.133 --> 01:02:41.427
Don't make me shoot first
and ask questions later.

01:02:44.890 --> 01:02:46.975
Start writing.

01:02:58.402 --> 01:03:00.488
What flavour are these?

01:03:02.907 --> 01:03:04.993
Potpourri.

01:03:08.372 --> 01:03:10.457
They're not bad.

01:03:15.463 --> 01:03:17.719
Here, but I'm not
sure any of these...

01:03:17.724 --> 01:03:19.851
are good enough to
have done that.

01:03:19.884 --> 01:03:22.218
Marvellous. Fabian?

01:03:23.888 --> 01:03:25.973
No. No.

01:03:27.265 --> 01:03:29.349
Get the painting.

01:03:42.905 --> 01:03:44.990
It's me.

01:03:48.494 --> 01:03:49.823
Am I disturbing you?

01:03:49.828 --> 01:03:51.199
No, not at all.

01:03:51.205 --> 01:03:53.290
It's late, I know, um...

01:03:58.087 --> 01:04:00.673
I'm sorry about before.

01:04:00.757 --> 01:04:03.550
I shouldn't have said
all those things.

01:04:05.804 --> 01:04:08.471
I was upset and very tired.

01:04:11.434 --> 01:04:12.971
Well, there's no harm done.

01:04:12.977 --> 01:04:15.229
What do you care what I think,
right?

01:04:20.944 --> 01:04:23.820
Well...
you should get some rest.

01:04:23.905 --> 01:04:26.656
- I can't sleep.
- What is it this time?

01:04:26.741 --> 01:04:28.278
My jaw's hurting.

01:04:28.284 --> 01:04:30.911
I have one too many teeth
at the back here.

01:04:30.994 --> 01:04:33.080
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:04:37.167 --> 01:04:39.963
Do you have any pills?
Temazepam? Trazodone?

01:04:40.046 --> 01:04:45.425
Sleeping pills? Soneryl?
Valium? Xanex? Sleepies?

01:04:45.509 --> 01:04:47.465
No. I'm sorry, no.

01:04:47.470 --> 01:04:50.180
All right,
I'll just go back to my...

01:04:52.099 --> 01:04:53.554
Just go back...

01:04:53.559 --> 01:04:55.644
I could...

01:04:57.355 --> 01:04:59.606
massage your feet.

01:05:02.152 --> 01:05:03.815
Are you serious?

01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:05.524
A-acupressure.

01:05:05.530 --> 01:05:07.947
I trained a long time ago.

01:05:08.823 --> 01:05:11.201
I occasionally
practice on myself.

01:05:11.286 --> 01:05:13.536
It's wonderful for anxiety.

01:05:13.621 --> 01:05:15.747
You massage your own feet?

01:05:20.336 --> 01:05:22.421
- Here?
- Mm.

01:05:23.046 --> 01:05:25.131
And there?

01:05:25.383 --> 01:05:28.760
You really have
a feel for this.

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:34.807
A great many people experience
fits of nocturnal anxiety.

01:05:34.893 --> 01:05:38.310
It's perfectly normal.
You mustn't worry about it.

01:05:39.854 --> 01:05:43.441
Can I tell you something?
A confession?

01:05:43.526 --> 01:05:44.647
Why not?

01:05:44.652 --> 01:05:48.363
I like having you
protecting me.

01:05:48.447 --> 01:05:51.491
You're really good at it.
Well, you seem to be.

01:05:54.244 --> 01:05:56.658
I don't really have
anything to compare it with,

01:05:56.664 --> 01:06:01.500
because no one--
no one ever tried before.

01:06:03.753 --> 01:06:05.838
But with you...

01:06:06.548 --> 01:06:08.633
I really enjoy it.

01:06:10.592 --> 01:06:13.429
Well...

01:06:13.513 --> 01:06:16.222
I enjoy...

01:06:16.308 --> 01:06:18.393
doing it.

01:06:21.604 --> 01:06:23.772
with me particularly?

01:06:25.357 --> 01:06:27.442
With you.

01:06:28.778 --> 01:06:30.863
Particularly.

01:06:43.335 --> 01:06:45.421
May I...

01:06:47.464 --> 01:06:49.549
do the other foot?

01:07:30.507 --> 01:07:32.086
Shit.

01:07:32.091 --> 01:07:34.176
Tony!

01:07:40.099 --> 01:07:40.454
Tony!

01:07:40.459 --> 01:07:42.810
Let me out, what
are you doing?!

01:07:42.894 --> 01:07:44.849
Tony! Please!

01:07:44.855 --> 01:07:47.898
Tony! She's gonna kill me!
Let me out! Please!

01:07:56.698 --> 01:07:58.533
This hideous old bat
in a wheelchair...

01:07:58.538 --> 01:07:59.571
just tried to kill me!

01:07:59.577 --> 01:08:01.615
She had a knife this big!
I swear!

01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:03.705
- It was horrible!
- It's true!

01:08:05.541 --> 01:08:07.038
Mother?

01:08:07.044 --> 01:08:09.878
Mother, are you there?
It's me.

01:08:14.384 --> 01:08:16.469
Mother.

01:08:25.643 --> 01:08:27.680
I've got everything
under control.

01:08:30.482 --> 01:08:32.567
She means well.

01:08:33.318 --> 01:08:36.696
Mother, can we
talk about this?

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:39.073
I'm very disappointed in you,
Victor.

01:08:39.158 --> 01:08:41.451
Could you sleep in
the living room?

01:08:41.533 --> 01:08:43.323
- I'm too frightened.
- Come to my room.

01:08:43.328 --> 01:08:45.951
That's an excellent idea.
Tony will look after you.

01:08:45.957 --> 01:08:48.541
Your reputation is in tatters!

01:08:54.215 --> 01:08:55.336
Mother--

01:08:55.341 --> 01:08:57.426
Is she, like,
your typical mother?

01:08:59.470 --> 01:09:03.055
Until you kill that floozy,
you're the target.

01:09:03.138 --> 01:09:05.307
I was behind the door.

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:06.932
Never face a closed door.

01:09:06.937 --> 01:09:08.849
How many times
have I told you?

01:09:08.854 --> 01:09:11.897
- Forgive me, I just--
- No, stop.

01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:13.979
Do you realize the mess
that you're in?

01:09:13.984 --> 01:09:17.111
I should have stayed
here with you.

01:09:17.194 --> 01:09:18.899
Since I moved out,
you've gone to the dogs.

01:09:18.904 --> 01:09:21.406
You're not even
sleeping with her.

01:09:25.203 --> 01:09:28.872
Mother,
I think we have a problem.

01:09:28.956 --> 01:09:30.620
Oh, I think so, too.

01:09:30.626 --> 01:09:32.956
I know you've invested
a great deal in me--

01:09:32.961 --> 01:09:35.211
A Beretta for your
seventh birthday.

01:09:35.216 --> 01:09:35.917
A Beretta.

01:09:35.921 --> 01:09:36.952
The pistol of princes.

01:09:36.957 --> 01:09:38.502
No boy could have
asked for more.

01:09:38.508 --> 01:09:42.551
Indeed.
I just wonder...

01:09:42.636 --> 01:09:44.889
a-as a result...

01:09:44.971 --> 01:09:47.058
what I've become.

01:09:49.645 --> 01:09:51.729
You've become your
father's son.

01:09:56.276 --> 01:09:58.063
You saved my life.

01:09:58.068 --> 01:09:59.900
Again.

01:09:59.905 --> 01:10:01.610
I didn't mean to.

01:10:01.615 --> 01:10:03.700
I've never been so scared.

01:10:04.618 --> 01:10:06.785
I'm glad you did.

01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:09.309
Because I got something
to live for now.

01:10:16.005 --> 01:10:18.090
I'm in love.

01:10:19.174 --> 01:10:20.420
Really?

01:10:20.425 --> 01:10:22.717
Oh, yes.

01:10:22.802 --> 01:10:24.887
Yes, yes, yes.

01:10:30.393 --> 01:10:32.478
Get in.

01:10:32.854 --> 01:10:34.939
Go on.

01:10:38.650 --> 01:10:40.735
Just lie back.

01:10:43.531 --> 01:10:49.703
He's so nice.

01:10:49.787 --> 01:10:51.872
Who is?

01:10:55.168 --> 01:10:57.335
Mr. Maynard, of course.

01:10:57.419 --> 01:10:59.504
- Really?
- Mmm.

01:11:01.255 --> 01:11:04.522
You know, when his
mother woke me,

01:11:04.527 --> 01:11:06.928
I was dreaming about him.

01:11:08.347 --> 01:11:10.432
- Really?
- Mm.

01:11:12.517 --> 01:11:16.645
It's funny, because yesterday,
I couldn't wait to get away,

01:11:16.730 --> 01:11:19.982
and now I never want to leave.

01:11:21.694 --> 01:11:23.779
What happened in between?

01:11:25.155 --> 01:11:27.240
Just enough.

01:11:28.325 --> 01:11:31.158
No, we'll just stay
here together,

01:11:31.164 --> 01:11:32.992
just the three of us.

01:11:32.998 --> 01:11:35.083
One big happy family.

01:11:48.929 --> 01:11:51.515
- A difficult night.
- Not at all.

01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:56.395
I owe you an explanation
about my mother.

01:11:56.478 --> 01:11:59.438
- I understand how you feel.
- Do you?

01:11:59.523 --> 01:12:02.347
I had a cousin
like your mother.

01:12:02.352 --> 01:12:04.736
Mad as a balloon, poor boy.

01:12:04.819 --> 01:12:07.030
And I adored him.

01:12:07.114 --> 01:12:09.239
And family's family, right?

01:12:17.916 --> 01:12:21.295
I don't need your help.
I can easily get a taxi back.

01:12:21.378 --> 01:12:23.463
I got one here, after all.

01:13:10.051 --> 01:13:11.589
Oh, how did you--

01:13:11.595 --> 01:13:13.393
Excuse me, my name's Fabian,

01:13:13.398 --> 01:13:16.098
and I would like you
to recommend to me...

01:13:16.181 --> 01:13:19.766
someone who could paint
something like this.

01:13:22.814 --> 01:13:24.517
Who did this?

01:13:24.523 --> 01:13:26.436
Rembrandt.

01:13:26.441 --> 01:13:28.526
Who?

01:13:29.403 --> 01:13:30.774
Rembrandt.

01:13:30.779 --> 01:13:32.906
Gimme his address. Now.

01:13:34.949 --> 01:13:36.155
He's dead.

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:39.121
Dead? When?

01:13:39.205 --> 01:13:41.747
Three hundred years ago.

01:13:51.509 --> 01:13:52.714
Gimme a name now.

01:13:52.719 --> 01:13:54.324
Okay, okay,
something that good,

01:13:54.330 --> 01:13:55.383
it's got to be Gerry.

01:13:55.388 --> 01:13:56.883
- Gerry who?
- Gerry Bailey.

01:13:56.888 --> 01:13:57.820
National Gallery,

01:13:57.825 --> 01:13:59.803
works in the
restoration department.

01:13:59.808 --> 01:14:01.894
He's a friend.

01:14:03.146 --> 01:14:05.231
Good.

01:14:05.982 --> 01:14:08.191
Took a while but...

01:14:08.276 --> 01:14:10.361
Hello.

01:14:11.445 --> 01:14:13.530
What a mess.

01:14:33.176 --> 01:14:41.390
Happy birthday to you...

01:14:41.475 --> 01:14:46.146
Happy Birthday,
Mr. Maynard

01:14:46.230 --> 01:14:47.350
It's all for me?

01:14:47.355 --> 01:14:50.983
Happy birthday to you

01:14:54.405 --> 01:14:55.567
I'm touched.

01:14:55.573 --> 01:14:57.950
I-it's so kind of you.

01:14:58.033 --> 01:14:59.529
I know.

01:14:59.534 --> 01:15:01.323
Blow them out.

01:15:01.329 --> 01:15:03.414
Oh.

01:15:09.253 --> 01:15:10.320
Sorry about the mirror.

01:15:10.325 --> 01:15:12.042
I've never opened
one of these before.

01:15:12.047 --> 01:15:13.711
How did you know it was today?

01:15:13.716 --> 01:15:16.254
The date was on the pictures
in your old room.

01:15:16.259 --> 01:15:18.344
I'll open another.

01:15:20.973 --> 01:15:22.344
I'm going up
the country...

01:15:22.349 --> 01:15:24.434
Baby, don't you wanna go?

01:15:26.312 --> 01:15:28.397
I'm going up
the country...

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:30.101
Baby, don't you wanna go?

01:15:31.609 --> 01:15:36.278
I'm going to someplace
where I've never been before

01:15:36.363 --> 01:15:37.649
Ah!

01:15:37.654 --> 01:15:39.921
I'm going, I'm going...

01:15:39.927 --> 01:15:42.868
where the water
tastes like wine...

01:15:42.951 --> 01:15:45.378
Hey, hey, yeah, I'm going...

01:15:45.383 --> 01:15:48.039
where the water
tastes like wine...

01:15:50.043 --> 01:15:54.463
We can jump in the water,
stay drunk all the time...

01:15:56.007 --> 01:15:57.794
Now, baby,
pack your leaving trunk...

01:15:57.799 --> 01:15:59.797
You know we got
to leave today...

01:15:59.802 --> 01:16:01.043
Just exactly
where we're going,

01:16:01.048 --> 01:16:01.508
cannot say...

01:16:01.513 --> 01:16:06.057
But we might even leave
the U.K.

01:16:07.393 --> 01:16:11.247
'Cause there's
a brand new game...

01:16:11.252 --> 01:16:13.481
that I want to play...

01:16:14.692 --> 01:16:16.777
Oh, yeah

01:16:45.597 --> 01:16:47.429
Did you do that?

01:16:47.434 --> 01:16:49.519
No, you did.

01:17:03.950 --> 01:17:05.947
I'm st--stuck.

01:17:08.746 --> 01:17:11.373
No, I mean, I can't move.

01:17:11.458 --> 01:17:14.542
- My shoes.
- You've got have them on.

01:17:14.626 --> 01:17:17.378
- My shoes.
- Ah.

01:17:20.925 --> 01:17:22.921
Ah. Yes.

01:17:22.927 --> 01:17:26.222
No. No, of course...

01:17:29.766 --> 01:17:38.441
Happy birthday to you...

01:17:38.525 --> 01:17:42.738
Happy birthday,
Mr. Maynard

01:17:42.822 --> 01:17:44.275
That's my watch.

01:17:44.281 --> 01:17:46.533
That way, I knew
you'd like it.

01:17:49.245 --> 01:17:51.330
Thank you.

01:17:56.252 --> 01:17:58.338
What do you weigh?

01:18:07.762 --> 01:18:09.848
Morning.

01:18:09.930 --> 01:18:13.017
Dear God, Mike.

01:18:13.101 --> 01:18:15.187
You were dull before.

01:18:22.194 --> 01:18:24.861
Tony,
what do you think of this room?

01:18:26.072 --> 01:18:28.157
It needs colour.

01:18:50.847 --> 01:19:06.069
Colour.

01:20:10.635 --> 01:20:13.922
'For your first
hit, my first gun.

01:20:13.927 --> 01:20:15.552
Congratulations.

01:20:15.557 --> 01:20:17.642
Your loving father, Felix.'

01:20:59.099 --> 01:21:01.184
Colour.

01:21:02.770 --> 01:21:05.187
Tony,
I think she's gonna like this.

01:21:13.196 --> 01:21:15.489
Rose? Can I come in?

01:21:15.575 --> 01:21:18.326
Uh, no.
I--I'm not decent.

01:21:18.410 --> 01:21:22.329
Oh, um...

01:21:22.413 --> 01:21:24.036
Everything okay?

01:21:24.041 --> 01:21:25.829
Fine.
Why wouldn't it be?

01:21:25.835 --> 01:21:28.544
No reason.
Only, come down.

01:21:28.629 --> 01:21:30.714
I have something to show you.

01:21:32.507 --> 01:21:34.633
Don't you want
to come and see?

01:21:47.689 --> 01:21:49.519
Why are you smiling?

01:21:49.524 --> 01:21:51.609
You'll find out.

01:21:56.197 --> 01:21:57.944
Come on.
Turn around, please.

01:21:57.949 --> 01:21:59.278
Why?

01:21:59.283 --> 01:22:01.197
What's wrong?
Turn around.

01:22:01.202 --> 01:22:02.490
Tell me why first.

01:22:02.496 --> 01:22:04.581
Turn round.

01:22:04.623 --> 01:22:06.160
You're in on it, too?

01:22:06.165 --> 01:22:09.086
- Sure.
- Come on. Don't be a baby.

01:22:16.050 --> 01:22:18.135
Why are you doing this?

01:22:18.303 --> 01:22:20.388
Make it a bigger surprise.

01:22:26.394 --> 01:22:28.772
I've got you.
Don't be afraid.

01:22:28.856 --> 01:22:30.941
It'll be over in no time.

01:22:35.362 --> 01:22:37.275
Not long to go now.

01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:39.193
Ooh!

01:22:39.198 --> 01:22:42.868
Agh! Oh! Rose!

01:22:42.952 --> 01:22:44.574
Not long for you two either!

01:22:44.579 --> 01:22:45.784
That gun's dangerous.

01:22:45.789 --> 01:22:47.286
You don't say.
Hands up!

01:22:47.291 --> 01:22:48.173
No, you misunderstand.

01:22:48.178 --> 01:22:49.664
I keep that gun for
sentimental rea--

01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:51.956
Don't shoot!
It can blow up in your face!

01:22:51.961 --> 01:22:53.916
You're a liar.
And you're a killer.

01:22:53.921 --> 01:22:55.126
And you're a thief.

01:22:55.131 --> 01:22:56.794
You're made for each other.

01:22:56.799 --> 01:22:59.509
As for you,
when did you find out?

01:22:59.593 --> 01:23:00.490
- Find out what?

01:23:00.495 --> 01:23:02.590
That he is not a
private detective!

01:23:02.596 --> 01:23:06.766
He's a hit man!
He was hired to kill me!

01:23:06.850 --> 01:23:08.764
I'm afraid what
she says is true.

01:23:08.769 --> 01:23:11.938
You are absolute shits.
The pair of you.

01:23:12.023 --> 01:23:12.899
I don't know...

01:23:12.905 --> 01:23:14.990
how you can live
with yourselves.

01:23:54.689 --> 01:23:57.230
But I thought
I was an apprentice detective.

01:23:57.235 --> 01:23:59.272
Who sometimes shot people?

01:23:59.277 --> 01:24:00.347
Only sometimes.

01:24:00.352 --> 01:24:02.779
By accident if it
was unavoidable.

01:24:02.865 --> 01:24:04.991
Are you gonna kill me now?

01:24:05.076 --> 01:24:07.073
Of course not. No.

01:24:07.078 --> 01:24:09.411
But if you leave,
someone else will.

01:24:09.497 --> 01:24:11.732
There's a list of
likely candidates,

01:24:11.737 --> 01:24:13.787
and I can guess
who's at the top.

01:24:13.792 --> 01:24:14.913
Who?

01:24:14.918 --> 01:24:17.003
Dixon.

01:24:18.087 --> 01:24:20.882
Dixon? Is he good?

01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:24.593
He's a disgrace to
the profession.

01:24:24.677 --> 01:24:27.264
A sadist, an animal.

01:24:27.348 --> 01:24:28.761
Mr. Maynard?

01:24:28.766 --> 01:24:30.596
Yes, Tony?

01:24:30.601 --> 01:24:32.686
We'll get him.

01:25:39.919 --> 01:25:42.004
I feel.

01:25:42.589 --> 01:25:44.674
I felt.

01:25:46.050 --> 01:25:48.135
I have felt.

01:25:49.678 --> 01:25:52.055
Gerry? Gerry.

01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:53.201
We're in trouble.

01:25:53.206 --> 01:25:55.709
I'm afraid that things
have got a bit...

01:25:55.726 --> 01:25:57.811
dangerous.

01:25:58.395 --> 01:26:00.480
Gerry.

01:26:03.609 --> 01:26:05.105
Where is he?

01:26:05.111 --> 01:26:07.196
Who?

01:26:08.698 --> 01:26:10.950
The man
who was supposed to kill you.

01:26:10.992 --> 01:26:13.030
Who wants to know?

01:26:13.035 --> 01:26:15.120
His replacement.

01:26:33.014 --> 01:26:35.099
So where is he?

01:26:36.057 --> 01:26:37.347
I don't know.

01:26:37.352 --> 01:26:39.776
Tell me, or I'll cut
off his finger...

01:26:39.781 --> 01:26:41.392
and make you swallow it.

01:26:41.397 --> 01:26:44.439
Then I'll leave
you alone with him.

01:26:47.570 --> 01:26:49.655
What, you want to be brave?

01:26:50.614 --> 01:26:52.699
That's what Gerry wanted, too.

01:27:01.584 --> 01:27:03.669
Hand, please.

01:27:17.725 --> 01:27:19.096
I've lost my touch.

01:27:19.101 --> 01:27:20.514
No, reload.

01:27:20.519 --> 01:27:22.515
I'll mark it through with you.

01:27:22.521 --> 01:27:24.606
Here we go.

01:27:24.691 --> 01:27:26.562
Feet, check.

01:27:26.567 --> 01:27:28.652
Hand, check.

01:27:28.653 --> 01:27:31.821
Wrist, check.

01:27:31.906 --> 01:27:34.325
If you have time, relax.

01:27:34.408 --> 01:27:36.826
I have time.
I relax.

01:27:36.910 --> 01:27:38.995
I hold my breath.

01:27:40.748 --> 01:27:43.249
I am at one with my gun.

01:27:55.887 --> 01:27:57.824
How about if I
don't watch you?

01:27:57.829 --> 01:27:59.914
I might be putting you off.

01:28:02.477 --> 01:28:05.937
Feet... hand...

01:28:06.022 --> 01:28:08.858
wrist... breath.

01:28:15.656 --> 01:28:17.403
Extraordinary.

01:28:17.408 --> 01:28:21.870
Tony, people train for years
to be able to do that.

01:28:21.954 --> 01:28:24.289
I didn't shoot.

01:28:38.428 --> 01:28:41.223
Put your guns down... slowly.

01:28:52.693 --> 01:28:54.778
Victor Maynard.

01:28:56.365 --> 01:28:57.902
At last.

01:28:57.908 --> 01:28:59.320
And you are?

01:28:59.325 --> 01:29:01.700
You know full well who I am.

01:29:05.790 --> 01:29:07.876
Dixon.

01:29:09.085 --> 01:29:11.254
Hector Dixon.

01:29:11.337 --> 01:29:12.750
How do you spell that?

01:29:12.755 --> 01:29:14.840
Don't wind him up.

01:29:14.966 --> 01:29:16.962
Dixon. Dix--

01:29:16.967 --> 01:29:18.535
Are you the one who does...

01:29:18.540 --> 01:29:20.342
the hits I'm not
interested in?

01:29:20.347 --> 01:29:23.264
And the ones you mess up.

01:29:23.348 --> 01:29:25.475
Did they torture you?

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:27.557
No, I gave them
your address right away.

01:29:27.562 --> 01:29:29.648
Good girl.

01:29:29.689 --> 01:29:32.149
Why didn't you carry out
the contract?

01:29:34.361 --> 01:29:36.946
Why do you think?

01:29:39.072 --> 01:29:40.860
Yeah.

01:29:40.866 --> 01:29:43.243
It's very... heart-warming.

01:29:43.328 --> 01:29:45.413
Up against the wall.

01:29:52.337 --> 01:29:55.047
- I've missed you.
- I've missed you, too.

01:29:57.550 --> 01:29:58.754
Tony...

01:29:58.759 --> 01:30:03.387
Maynard, do your job,
and I won't kill the boy.

01:30:03.472 --> 01:30:05.179
I'm sorry?

01:30:05.184 --> 01:30:08.685
Kill the girl.

01:30:08.769 --> 01:30:12.230
I'll shoot you,
but he'll be safe.

01:30:41.801 --> 01:30:43.006
I can't.

01:30:43.011 --> 01:30:45.097
- Do it!
- Okay, calm down.

01:30:49.976 --> 01:30:51.598
Just do it.

01:30:51.603 --> 01:30:53.980
I'd rather it was you.
I want the best.

01:30:57.525 --> 01:31:01.487
Je t'aime.

01:31:09.746 --> 01:31:11.576
Freeze!

01:31:11.581 --> 01:31:13.666
Agh!

01:31:15.836 --> 01:31:17.921
You, hands up!

01:31:19.798 --> 01:31:21.883
Higher than that.

01:31:21.967 --> 01:31:23.658
At your age, I
still have to do...

01:31:23.663 --> 01:31:24.756
your homework for you.

01:31:24.761 --> 01:31:26.846
- You there.
- Me?

01:31:26.888 --> 01:31:29.140
Yes, you.
Pick up that gun.

01:31:29.223 --> 01:31:31.309
And search the runt.

01:31:33.602 --> 01:31:37.190
This boy, you see,
he could be trained.

01:31:37.274 --> 01:31:39.126
But he'll never
have what you have,

01:31:39.131 --> 01:31:40.188
the killer instinct.

01:31:40.193 --> 01:31:42.565
You know I don't believe
in the killer instinct.

01:31:42.570 --> 01:31:43.054
Oh, no,

01:31:43.059 --> 01:31:45.489
you believe in
nurture over nature.

01:31:45.574 --> 01:31:48.159
Otherwise known
as 'Blame The Mother.'

01:31:48.242 --> 01:31:51.746
Whatever our differences...

01:31:51.831 --> 01:31:54.457
I'm grateful to you today.

01:31:54.540 --> 01:31:57.793
Oh, don't get sentimental.
Please.

01:32:02.132 --> 01:32:03.752
Did you see that?

01:32:03.758 --> 01:32:06.300
- See what?
- Shit.

01:32:06.386 --> 01:32:07.591
Nobody move!

01:32:07.596 --> 01:32:09.343
Oh, I forgot,
he took that one off me.

01:32:09.348 --> 01:32:11.682
Put the guns down.

01:32:13.059 --> 01:32:15.145
Now!

01:32:15.354 --> 01:32:17.439
And the knife.

01:32:19.065 --> 01:32:21.609
Really lost your touch,
Maynard.

01:32:21.693 --> 01:32:23.778
That's Felix's gun.

01:32:25.154 --> 01:32:27.819
That was my father's first
and favourite weapon.

01:32:27.824 --> 01:32:28.039
Mm.

01:32:28.044 --> 01:32:30.576
Hope that thought
softens the blow.

01:32:32.371 --> 01:32:34.283
Goodbye.

01:32:39.543 --> 01:32:40.872
Tony...

01:32:40.877 --> 01:32:44.338
Come and see what happens
if you don't clean your gun.

01:33:29.009 --> 01:33:31.094
Angel!

01:33:35.015 --> 01:33:37.100
Has anybody seen the cat?

01:33:38.305 --> 01:33:44.818
