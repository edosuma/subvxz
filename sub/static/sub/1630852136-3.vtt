00:11.446 --> 00:13.056
I just got
a call from Florida,

00:13.143 --> 00:15.406
they're tracking
a possible anthrax attack.

00:15.493 --> 00:17.887
The last natural human
infection on American soil

00:17.974 --> 00:20.194
was almost 30 years ago.

00:20.281 --> 00:22.283
You're not
the only one that's
supposed to see things coming.

00:22.370 --> 00:24.459
But what
if I do this time?

00:24.546 --> 00:25.851
And no one listens?

00:25.938 --> 00:28.245
The results came back.
It's Ames.

00:28.332 --> 00:29.942
I didn't think
it existed outside our
high-security research labs.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.770
It doesn't.

00:31.857 --> 00:33.381
<i>JUDITH : </i>
I share the concern about

00:33.468 --> 00:35.557
<i>Iraq's biological </i>
weapons program.

00:35.644 --> 00:37.385
MOORE:
Is Al-Qaeda even in Iraq?

00:37.472 --> 00:38.603
Iraq's bioweapons
capabilities were shut down

00:38.690 --> 00:40.257
after the war.

00:40.344 --> 00:42.390
As far as you
and I have been told.

00:42.477 --> 00:44.609
Anthrax
spores do not die off.

00:44.696 --> 00:46.394
They lay in wait.

00:46.481 --> 00:48.613
What we are talking about
is a ticking time bomb.

00:48.700 --> 00:50.311
Where might the
letter have been dropped off?

00:50.398 --> 00:52.095
One of
our blue boxes?

00:52.182 --> 00:53.053
How many of those
blue boxes are we talking?

00:53.140 --> 00:55.098
Over 600.

00:55.185 --> 00:57.100
Bruce, we got some
samples coming in from Florida.

00:57.187 --> 01:03.063
Do you suspect someone
at work is possibly involved?

01:03.150 --> 01:05.456
<i>BROKAW : </i>

01:05.543 --> 01:07.806

<i>REPORTER : But </i>
Daschle insisting his members

04:27.136 --> 04:29.269
Man, somebody
got really excited when

04:29.356 --> 04:30.313
they came up with that one.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.445
Mm-hmm.

04:31.532 --> 04:32.533
Oh. Shocker.

04:32.620 --> 04:34.317
More hate mail.

04:34.404 --> 04:36.145
Want me to drop
it off in Leahy's office?

04:37.451 --> 04:39.540
Ooh.

04:39.627 --> 04:43.674
Please, let it be
cute drawings instead
of misspelled profanity.

04:44.762 --> 04:45.807
Oh, my God.

04:47.896 --> 04:51.813
Okay, what did
they say in the training?

04:54.468 --> 04:57.427
No one move more
than you have to.

04:57.514 --> 05:00.648
Billy, call the
Capitol Police.

05:00.735 --> 05:02.606
Steve, the FBI?

05:02.693 --> 05:03.955
Got it.

Close the door.

05:12.050 --> 05:14.357
Toretti.
Counterterrorism.

05:20.189 --> 05:21.364
Okay.

05:23.671 --> 05:25.368
I need a team at
Capitol Hill right now.

05:52.874 --> 05:55.050
Toretti, Profiler
with Counterterrorism.

05:55.137 --> 05:56.530
Profiler?

05:56.617 --> 05:58.183
You're like a
shrink or something?

05:58.270 --> 06:00.055
Yeah, if
disco was still a thing.

06:00.142 --> 06:01.796
Where's the letter?

06:01.883 --> 06:03.014
I got a guard on it.

06:03.101 --> 06:04.973
Forensics is on their way.

06:05.060 --> 06:06.844
Listen, we've responded two
of these hoaxes already today.

06:06.931 --> 06:08.629
There's no reason to
think this is any different.

06:08.716 --> 06:09.978
Oh, there's a
lot of reasons, actually.

06:10.065 --> 06:11.849
I got a Hazmat
team on their way.

06:11.936 --> 06:13.808
You seal that contaminated
room until they decon it.

06:13.895 --> 06:16.071
Get me somebody in facilities.

06:16.158 --> 06:18.856
It could be pumping
spores through this
entire building right now.

06:18.943 --> 06:21.206
Shut this
ventilation system down!

06:21.293 --> 06:24.296
Tell Hazmat I need
rapid tests, swabs, and Cipro.

06:27.778 --> 06:28.997
Are you the one that found it?

06:29.084 --> 06:30.520
- Yeah.
- Okay.

06:30.607 --> 06:32.870
Is it really anthrax?

06:32.957 --> 06:34.655
We can't run
it until the letter's
been swabbed for evidence.

06:34.742 --> 06:36.744
But either way, we're gonna
start you on antibiotics.

06:36.831 --> 06:38.746
So if you were exposed,
hammering it with Cipro before

06:38.833 --> 06:40.835
symptoms appear
should knock it out.

06:40.922 --> 06:42.314
It's what they
did in New York.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.012
What about the others?

06:44.099 --> 06:45.579
It's
the same protocol.

06:45.666 --> 06:46.884
You gotta hit 'em
before they hit you,

06:46.971 --> 06:48.451
that's what my
mom always says.

06:48.538 --> 06:50.192
I got the
South Dakota version.

06:50.279 --> 06:52.412
Better to be
cautious than sorry.

06:52.499 --> 06:54.588
That's right.
You'll be okay.

07:13.128 --> 07:15.478

Anthrax letter.

Where?

07:41.330 --> 07:42.984
Senator
Daschle's office.

07:43.071 --> 07:44.464
But there's already
an agent on the ground,

07:44.551 --> 07:46.161
she caught the
call when it came in.

07:46.248 --> 07:47.467
I'm on my way in.

07:50.687 --> 07:51.993
I need to see that letter.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.516
Uh,
Special Agent Ryker,

07:53.603 --> 07:55.257
forensics is doing
a sweep right now on

07:55.344 --> 07:57.564
the Daschle letter for
hair, skin, any particles.

07:57.651 --> 07:59.130
I know you didn't find
anything on the New York
letters, but I thought...

07:59.217 --> 08:01.524
Worth a shot.
Who are you?

08:01.611 --> 08:02.960
TORETTI:
Special Agent Toretti. Dani.

08:03.047 --> 08:04.135
What division?

08:04.222 --> 08:05.136
Counterterrorism.

08:05.223 --> 08:06.703
I lead a fly team.

08:06.790 --> 08:08.749
Washington Field Office
called us in.

08:08.836 --> 08:10.141
- On Hazmat?
- Mm-hmm.

08:10.228 --> 08:11.839
So I'll
take it from here.

08:11.926 --> 08:13.275
No, that is
not how this is gonna go.

08:13.362 --> 08:14.668
I was first
boots on the ground.

08:16.626 --> 08:18.367
I read your briefings
on Florida and New York,

08:18.454 --> 08:20.195
I've seen copies
of the letters.

08:20.282 --> 08:21.849
It's the same
block handwriting,

08:21.936 --> 08:23.590
slanted to the right.

08:23.677 --> 08:24.939
This sure as hell looks
like the same guy to me.

08:25.026 --> 08:26.941
Guy?
You mean Al-Qaeda?

08:27.028 --> 08:28.943
No, that would
not be my first thought.

08:29.030 --> 08:31.032
I would lean more
towards a lone wolf.

08:31.119 --> 08:32.468
Three weeks after
terrorists started a war?

08:32.555 --> 08:34.383
Not a chance.

08:34.470 --> 08:36.211
Here's the thing,
it was postmarked three weeks

08:36.298 --> 08:37.821
after the New York letters.

08:39.867 --> 08:41.695
After Bob Stevens?

08:41.782 --> 08:44.480
Yeah, and after the
entire country saw it on TV.

08:44.567 --> 08:46.308
So our sender knew
he had killed someone.

08:46.395 --> 08:48.702
He wants more people to die.

08:48.789 --> 08:50.747
And we've swabbed all
the interns in the room now,

08:50.834 --> 08:52.488
I'm gonna order anthrax tests
for everybody that was in

08:52.575 --> 08:53.750
the Hart building today.

08:53.837 --> 08:55.491
We need a wider sweep.

08:55.578 --> 08:56.579
I'd quarantine all the
mail in the Capitol until

08:56.666 --> 08:57.972
we can get it tested.

08:58.059 --> 08:59.451
You
wanna just shut down

08:59.539 --> 09:01.410
the entire
United States government?

09:01.497 --> 09:02.977
The Hill anyway, until
we can get the staffers tested

09:03.064 --> 09:05.109
in the office and deconned.

09:05.196 --> 09:08.417
In a perfect world, I'd set
up a full BSL4 lab to handle

09:08.504 --> 09:10.201
that kind of volume.

09:10.288 --> 09:11.594
Daschle had the
President on the phone and

09:11.681 --> 09:13.857
we've been
offered all resources.

09:13.944 --> 09:16.860
Good, I'll
get someone scouting
locations to start the build.

09:16.947 --> 09:21.343
Also, we need to get the head
of pathology from USAMRIID

09:21.430 --> 09:23.258
over here and take
a look at that letter,

09:23.345 --> 09:25.477
send it back to the lab, and
see if it comes back positive.

09:41.972 --> 09:43.974
Thanks.
We'll take it from here.

10:01.905 --> 10:05.430
Uh, the type of
writing is the same,

10:05.517 --> 10:08.608
but the powder is
different from the
Brokaw and <i>Post</i> letters.

10:08.695 --> 10:10.087
Take a look.

10:10.174 --> 10:13.090
It's whiter,
less clumpy, no debris.

10:13.177 --> 10:14.788
I need to know if
it's the same strain.

10:17.094 --> 10:21.142
You'll notice something
different about this letter.

10:21.229 --> 10:24.014
- A return address.
- Our guy is smart.

10:24.101 --> 10:26.321
He knows that the anthrax
letters have been in the news,

10:26.408 --> 10:27.975
people are nervous.

10:28.062 --> 10:29.150
You see a letter with
strange handwriting,

10:29.237 --> 10:30.542
you're gonna chuck it.

10:30.630 --> 10:31.805
But from a bunch of kids.

10:31.892 --> 10:33.415
Yeah.

10:33.502 --> 10:34.634
We have to track down
the address and get

10:34.721 --> 10:36.026
this to USAMRIID for testing.

10:43.077 --> 10:45.557
Both the Brokaw
and <i>The Post</i> letters
are postmarked here,

10:45.645 --> 10:48.169
so our agents are gonna
swab all 600 plus mailboxes

10:48.256 --> 10:49.561
that feed into this facility,

10:49.649 --> 10:50.954
full hazmat gear.

10:51.041 --> 10:52.564
This is gonna
be tedious, okay,

10:52.652 --> 10:54.131
but if we can
identify this specific box,

10:54.218 --> 10:55.263
it's gonna help lead
us to the terrorists.

10:57.395 --> 10:58.396
Excuse me.

10:58.483 --> 11:00.485
Hey, it's Chris Moore.

11:00.572 --> 11:01.835
<i>RYKER : Hey, put </i>
another agent on the boxes,

11:01.922 --> 11:03.575
<i>I need you on something else.</i>

11:03.663 --> 11:05.360
The Daschle letter
has a return address.

11:05.447 --> 11:08.015
It's an elementary school
in Franklin Park.

11:08.102 --> 11:09.973
<i>MOORE : </i>
Franklin Park?

11:10.060 --> 11:11.061
That's, that can't be
more than 20 miles from here.

11:21.332 --> 11:24.031
That fed guy is up
in Quinton's office again.

11:24.118 --> 11:26.381
Wonder what he
got himself into.

11:41.831 --> 11:44.094
Testing the
sample is gonna take me
a few hours in the lab.

11:44.181 --> 11:45.705
You got it.

11:45.792 --> 11:48.316
I'll let him know
we're heading over now.

11:50.666 --> 11:52.363
I can
give him an ETA.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.898
Is that from
the Daschle letter?

12:48.985 --> 12:51.509
Bruce.
I didn't you were here.

12:53.207 --> 12:54.948
Mind if I take a look?

12:55.035 --> 12:56.514
Sure.

13:07.874 --> 13:10.398
I've never seen
anthrax so aerosolized.

13:10.485 --> 13:13.618
It's far more
lethal in this form.

14:02.798 --> 14:06.454
Jody, what if the
anthrax killer is one of us?

14:08.412 --> 14:11.546
I think you're
letting all this get to you.

14:11.633 --> 14:13.504
Think about it, Jod.

14:13.591 --> 14:15.289
The terrorists would
still need some patsy here

14:15.376 --> 14:16.899
on the ground to
help them carry it out.

14:16.986 --> 14:18.205
Someone who has
access to anthrax and

14:18.292 --> 14:20.163
knows how to handle it.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.078
I know there's been a
flood of new faces around here

14:22.165 --> 14:24.689
with all with all the added
help for testing but they were

14:24.776 --> 14:26.822
brought in after
the letters were found.

14:26.909 --> 14:28.389
Be careful pointing fingers.

14:28.476 --> 14:30.521
Maybe
it's not someone new.

14:30.608 --> 14:32.567
For shirts and giggles, let's
just say this person was part

14:32.654 --> 14:34.308
of the old guard around here.

14:34.395 --> 14:36.353
Someone we've been
working with on a daily basis.

14:36.440 --> 14:39.443
Bruce,
there's enough division
around here as it is,

14:39.530 --> 14:41.793
science versus military,
old gen, new gen and

14:41.881 --> 14:43.230
without creating more,

14:43.317 --> 14:45.275
I just..

14:45.362 --> 14:47.060
I'm not sure I'm the
one you should be talking to.

14:50.411 --> 14:52.935
I tell you everything.

14:53.022 --> 14:54.894
I would never keep
something like this from you.

14:56.504 --> 14:58.767
If you really
have concerns, Bruce,

14:58.854 --> 15:00.334
you should
tell the Colonel.

15:02.118 --> 15:05.165
I just think we
have a duty here, you know.

15:05.252 --> 15:07.167
I mean, what if a person
could weasel their way into

15:07.254 --> 15:09.691
a position where
they could impede
the FBI's investigation,

15:09.778 --> 15:11.475
maybe even destroy evidence?

15:11.562 --> 15:13.651
It'd be up to us to
stop them, wouldn't it?

15:25.228 --> 15:26.577
Hey, Matt, I
have to call you back.

15:26.664 --> 15:28.101
Where are you?

15:28.188 --> 15:29.798
Not where
I'm supposed to be.

15:29.885 --> 15:31.669
Small Biz Committee
started three minutes ago.

15:31.756 --> 15:32.627
<i>RYKER : </i>
On the Hill?

15:32.714 --> 15:34.281
Yeah, why?

15:34.368 --> 15:35.412
I want you to
get out of the building.

15:35.499 --> 15:37.153
What's going on?

15:37.240 --> 15:38.807
The Hill's been
attacked, it's anthrax.

15:38.894 --> 15:40.417
<i>RYKER : </i>
In a few minutes,

15:40.504 --> 15:41.462
<i>every building's </i>
gonna be evacuated.

15:41.549 --> 15:43.116
Oh, my God.

15:43.203 --> 15:45.596
Listen, head to
Constitution and Second.

15:45.683 --> 15:46.728
<i>RYKER : </i>
There's three buses
arriving to take people to

15:46.815 --> 15:48.121
<i>Bethesda to get tested.</i>

15:48.208 --> 15:50.123
Get on
the first bus, okay?

15:50.210 --> 15:51.602
I'll call you later.

15:51.689 --> 15:54.040
Matthew?

15:54.127 --> 15:56.607
<i>REPORTER : </i>
As the evacuation on
Capitol Hill continues,

15:56.694 --> 15:59.393
<i>FBI teams scour for evidence.</i>

15:59.480 --> 16:01.308
<i>Growing sources insist there</i>

16:01.395 --> 16:03.701

between the New York and

16:03.788 --> 16:06.008
<i>D.C. mailings to terrorists,</i>

16:06.095 --> 16:08.271
<i>and possibly Iraq.</i>

16:08.358 --> 16:11.057
<i>So far, the FBI has </i>
declined to comment.

16:15.452 --> 16:16.932
Move it along, please.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.635
Okay,
do you have a fever?

16:26.333 --> 16:27.421
Take the
next person out here.

16:27.508 --> 16:30.032
Hi. Sheila Willis.

16:46.092 --> 16:49.617
<i>REPORTER : </i>
The FBI is quarantining
all mail on Capitol Hill.

16:49.704 --> 16:53.490
<i>And reportedly, the Bureau is </i>
building a lab as no labs on

16:53.577 --> 16:56.711
<i>the East Coast can </i>
handle the volume.

16:56.798 --> 16:59.975
Vacuum seals
capable of sustaining
directional airflow, uh,

17:00.062 --> 17:02.717
self-closing doors,
decontamination stations.

17:02.804 --> 17:06.938
You're building
an entire BSL4 lab in
an unsecure, unsterile space?

17:07.026 --> 17:08.810
Uh, it'll be
both once we're done.

17:08.897 --> 17:11.117
Daschle got a green light
directly from the White House.

17:11.204 --> 17:12.944
With this
splashed all over the news,

17:13.032 --> 17:15.556
whole damn seaboard is
terrified to touch their mail.

17:15.643 --> 17:17.993
Once we prove
the rest of the mail
on the Hill is clean,

17:18.080 --> 17:20.256
it'll put people's minds
at ease about their own.

17:20.343 --> 17:23.477
Fine,
the administration is
shelling out millions,

17:23.564 --> 17:25.827
you better deliver more
than just another envelope

17:25.914 --> 17:27.872
filled with white powder.

17:27.959 --> 17:30.527
Hand them the connection
to terrorists.

17:30.614 --> 17:34.140
Look, I'll
find the terrorists,

17:34.227 --> 17:36.446
but I've been hearing all
the rumblings in the press,

17:36.533 --> 17:39.145
and I don't know that
this came from Iraq.

17:39.232 --> 17:42.365
You and
I aren't cleared for
all classified intel.

17:42.452 --> 17:46.021
Who knows where those
bastards are hiding out?

17:46.108 --> 17:47.805
Just find them.

17:53.898 --> 17:55.900
Chris, tell me you
got something at the school.

17:55.987 --> 17:57.641
So, I hate to be
the bearer of bad news,

17:57.728 --> 18:00.340
but this return
address is bogus.

18:00.427 --> 18:03.125
There actually
aren't any schools called
Greendale in Franklin Park.

18:03.212 --> 18:05.475
The closest match
we could find was
a Greenbrook Elementary,

18:05.562 --> 18:07.129
it's in Kendall Park.

18:07.216 --> 18:09.218
But we've been here
since the doors opened,

18:09.305 --> 18:11.742
there's nobody on any FBI
Watchlist associated
with the school.

18:11.829 --> 18:13.353
CIA's got nothing.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.876
Students, faculty,
no one from Iraq?

18:14.963 --> 18:16.269
Uh, five students,

18:16.356 --> 18:18.227
three staff from
the Middle East.

18:18.314 --> 18:19.837
But I mean, these people have
all been vetted since 9/11.

18:19.924 --> 18:22.231
And there's none that
are of Iraqi descent.

18:22.318 --> 18:23.972
There's nothing here, Matt.

18:24.059 --> 18:26.192
<i>MOORE : Sorry.</i>

18:26.279 --> 18:28.281
<i>Look, I don't </i>
wanna overstep here, but...

18:28.368 --> 18:30.718
Didn't you say Iraq
never had the Ames strain?

18:30.805 --> 18:32.676
Yeah, we'll
know more once we find out

18:32.763 --> 18:34.852
where those
letters were mailed.

18:34.939 --> 18:37.638
In the meantime,
get everyone up there
swabbing mailboxes, okay?

18:37.725 --> 18:39.944
Okay.

18:40.031 --> 18:41.816
<i>REPORTER : Many </i>
US citizens have stopped

18:41.903 --> 18:45.298
<i>opening their mail, even </i>
tossing it on the curb.

18:45.385 --> 18:47.952
<i>We now join </i>
a live conference at

18:48.039 --> 18:50.912
<i>the Brentwood </i>
Mail Facility in D.C.

18:50.999 --> 18:53.567
<i>MANAGER : Thank you </i>
for joining us here today.

18:53.654 --> 18:56.135
<i>At the postal services </i>
in Washington, D.C.

18:56.222 --> 18:58.746
<i>processing and </i>
distribution center.

18:58.833 --> 19:01.836
<i>As you know, one letter </i>
from among the more than

19:01.923 --> 19:06.971
<i>3.5 million pieces of </i>
mail handled here each
day contained anthrax.

19:07.058 --> 19:08.973
<i>And there is no...</i>

19:09.060 --> 19:10.279
I don't know why they
made you stay after your shift

19:10.366 --> 19:11.976
and sweep up
round the sorters.

19:12.063 --> 19:15.023
You can't even
see them on the TV.

19:15.110 --> 19:16.807
<i>MANAGER : </i>
This afternoon, I am
announcing the offer of a

19:16.894 --> 19:21.072
<i>reward of up to </i>
$1 million for the information

19:21.160 --> 19:23.858
<i>leading to the arrest </i>
and conviction of those

<i>responsible for the </i>
mailing of the anthrax.

19:27.470 --> 19:29.080
You leavin'?

19:29.168 --> 19:30.256
There's enough
smoke being blown up

19:30.343 --> 19:32.475
certain places around here.

19:32.562 --> 19:35.348
And I'm feeling
a little run-down anyway.

19:37.437 --> 19:39.178
Later.

19:41.005 --> 19:42.616
How many others on
the Hill have been infected?

19:44.574 --> 19:46.707
We got 28 new cases,
hundreds more to test.

19:46.794 --> 19:48.839
And I've got
three more right here.

19:48.926 --> 19:50.885
Okay, let's pin 'em.

19:50.972 --> 19:53.322
The green indicates where
infected people worked,

19:53.409 --> 19:56.499
the red is where
our hazmat teams
found spores, here,

19:56.586 --> 19:58.936
high concentration
in Feingold's offices,

19:59.023 --> 20:00.895
in the central atrium,
and the courtyard in front

20:00.982 --> 20:02.679
of Daschle's suite.

20:02.766 --> 20:03.898
What about your three?

20:03.985 --> 20:05.378
I got Alicia Herrera,

20:05.465 --> 20:06.901
works in
Feingold's basement office.

20:06.988 --> 20:08.555
Okay.

20:08.642 --> 20:11.166
Mike Wakefield,
uh, Capitol Police,

20:11.253 --> 20:12.646
first responders.

20:12.733 --> 20:14.125
He's one of the first into

20:14.213 --> 20:15.257
the Hart Building
after the attack.

20:15.344 --> 20:16.432
That'd be atrium.

20:16.519 --> 20:17.999
And Peter Browning,

20:18.086 --> 20:20.741
a contractor in the
State Department...

20:20.828 --> 20:22.786
Building.

20:30.011 --> 20:31.621
Ryker?

20:31.708 --> 20:34.145
We shut the
Hill down too late.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.191
Somebody opened
another letter.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.243
Mr. Browning, I
just need to confirm,

20:44.330 --> 20:46.375
you were nowhere
near the Hart Building
this morning, correct?

20:46.462 --> 20:48.464
I stay in the annex.

20:48.551 --> 20:51.162
Keep my distance
from the senators
and staffers, the egos.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.947
How long
have you had symptoms?

20:53.034 --> 20:55.689
I've felt
like crap for two days.

20:55.776 --> 20:57.517
Well, you could have
been exposed days ago from an

20:57.604 --> 20:59.258
entirely different letter.

20:59.345 --> 21:02.217
We need to know when
that letter arrived and

21:02.304 --> 21:05.002
who might've been the target.

21:05.089 --> 21:06.917
Mr. Browning,

21:07.004 --> 21:09.224
think back, do you remember
opening any suspicious mail

21:09.311 --> 21:11.095
over the past week?

21:11.182 --> 21:12.706
It would've likely look
similar to the anthrax letters

21:12.793 --> 21:14.273
that you've seen on TV,

21:14.360 --> 21:16.275
with all caps and
childish handwriting.

21:16.362 --> 21:17.493
I don't
really see what comes in or

21:17.580 --> 21:19.147
where it's going.

21:19.234 --> 21:20.148
I'm a supervisor.

21:20.235 --> 21:22.106
I don't open mail.

21:22.193 --> 21:23.934
Ever.

21:33.248 --> 21:34.554
Uh, give
me a minute, okay?

21:34.641 --> 21:35.685
Yeah.

21:38.079 --> 21:39.776
Hey.

21:39.863 --> 21:44.346
Hey. How bad is this?

21:44.433 --> 21:47.523
I'm not really sure.
Are you okay?

21:47.610 --> 21:50.439
Yeah.
I'm still waiting to find out,
and they're getting us Cipro.

21:50.526 --> 21:51.962
Mm-hmm.

21:52.049 --> 21:53.573
I'm trying
not to freak out.

21:53.660 --> 21:55.749
Hey, you're
gonna be okay, all right?

21:55.836 --> 21:56.967
The important thing is
they caught everyone on

21:57.054 --> 21:58.099
the Hill early.

21:58.186 --> 21:59.709
Okay.

21:59.796 --> 22:01.842
Um, I really gotta go.

22:01.929 --> 22:02.886
I'll check in with you later?

22:02.973 --> 22:04.235
Okay.

22:10.416 --> 22:12.200
It's a little high,
but not so bad.

22:12.287 --> 22:13.636
Flu's going around.

22:13.723 --> 22:15.421
It don't
feel like the flu.

22:15.508 --> 22:17.292
You know, Joe
left after his shift.

22:17.379 --> 22:19.120
Looked like hell.

22:19.207 --> 22:21.340
Said he wasn't
feeling good neither.

22:21.427 --> 22:23.342
Joe said he hit
the crab cake buffet
at Milton's yesterday.

22:23.429 --> 22:25.256
Chances are
it's food poisoning.

22:25.344 --> 22:28.608
But they had
me shut down number 17.

22:28.695 --> 22:30.610
You don't think maybe it had
to do with what's happening on

22:30.697 --> 22:32.742
the Hill with
the anthrax mail?

22:32.829 --> 22:34.744
They held a whole
press conference here.

22:34.831 --> 22:36.485
All the big wigs
were down on the floor.

22:36.572 --> 22:38.748
They wouldn't do
that if it weren't safe.

22:38.835 --> 22:42.578
Look, just take a few
aspirin and finish up.

22:42.665 --> 22:45.799
You don't wanna use
a whole sick day just
'cause you're feeling warm.

23:18.484 --> 23:22.488
It is a blessing to see
so many faces here tonight.

23:22.575 --> 23:25.055
I only wish it was
for different reasons,

23:25.142 --> 23:28.581
but the atrocities of 9/11
have left us searching for

23:28.668 --> 23:32.933
answers and comfort in
the house of our Lord.

23:38.852 --> 23:41.158
Honey?

23:43.770 --> 23:45.424
Joe, you okay?

23:45.511 --> 23:47.077
What's going on?

24:05.661 --> 24:08.403
Come in.

24:08.490 --> 24:09.926
IVINS:
Colonel Charles, evening.

24:10.013 --> 24:12.146
Sorry to barge in
on you this late.

24:12.233 --> 24:13.930
Not a problem,
Dr. Ivins, especially

24:14.017 --> 24:15.715
if you keep it quick.

24:15.802 --> 24:16.933
Wife's making
pot roast tonight.

24:17.020 --> 24:17.891
Oh.

24:19.632 --> 24:22.373
It's about the
anthrax investigation, sir.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.767
I'd like to have a word
with you about Simon Kurz.

24:24.854 --> 24:26.552
You have
an issue with how
Kurz's running things?

24:26.639 --> 24:28.554
I do, sir.

24:28.641 --> 24:31.034
As you know I've spent my whole
career working on anthrax,

24:31.121 --> 24:33.036
I pretty much wrote
the book on it, uh,

24:33.123 --> 24:36.344
at least a cornucopia
of articles.

24:36.431 --> 24:39.695
And Simon has not consulted with
me about the Daschle letter.

24:39.782 --> 24:41.915
Not
that strange, Bruce.

24:42.002 --> 24:44.221
Situations like
this always fall to the
head of the department.

24:44.308 --> 24:46.963
With all due
respect to Dr. Kurz, sir,

24:47.050 --> 24:48.748
I'm the one here
who's worked on not one,

24:48.835 --> 24:50.053
but two anthrax vaccines

24:50.140 --> 24:53.317
and I just...

24:53.404 --> 24:54.971
I think something's amiss.

24:58.018 --> 25:00.455
You think Kurz is
purposely keeping you out?

25:00.542 --> 25:02.501
I don't
want to speculate, sir.

25:02.588 --> 25:04.851
I just want to help.

25:04.938 --> 25:08.942
If I could have a couple of
hours with the Daschle letter,

25:09.029 --> 25:11.771
there's some tests that
Simon hasn't run yet.

25:31.791 --> 25:33.488
They're the same
stock as the attack envelopes?

25:33.575 --> 25:36.360
Yes, how can a
person who didn't even open

25:36.447 --> 25:38.275
the letter get infected?

25:38.362 --> 25:40.321
I thought it took,
like, 8,000 spores?

25:40.408 --> 25:42.018
Do you know how
they got those estimates?

25:42.105 --> 25:43.890
Tests on monkeys.

25:43.977 --> 25:45.848
For humans, they
don't know exactly.

25:45.935 --> 25:47.850
Now, this cocoa powder is just
about the same particle size

25:47.937 --> 25:50.810
as the anthrax.

25:50.897 --> 25:54.030
So last week in New York,
a woman from <i>The Post,</i>

25:54.117 --> 25:55.771
said she was infected,

25:55.858 --> 25:58.252
who swears she never
opened an envelope.

25:58.339 --> 26:00.123
- Like Browning?
- Exactly.

26:00.210 --> 26:03.605
So I thought she just
couldn't remember opening it.

26:03.692 --> 26:05.868
Then we found it,
and it was sealed.

26:05.955 --> 26:07.827
But how can even a
few spores escape an envelope

26:07.914 --> 26:09.524
that's been taped shut?

26:09.611 --> 26:11.613
I don't think they did.

26:11.700 --> 26:14.616
This morning,
we got a call from
Dr. Kurz over at USAMRIID.

26:14.703 --> 26:17.053
He said that the
second batch of spores were

26:17.140 --> 26:18.925
the most refined
he's ever seen.

26:26.367 --> 26:28.238
Powder's not leaking
from the edges of the tape.

26:30.371 --> 26:32.634
It's coming
right through the
fibers of the envelope.

26:32.721 --> 26:34.854
Which means that anyone
even in the vicinity of the

26:34.941 --> 26:37.900
anthrax letters is at risk.

26:37.987 --> 26:40.599
There could be
a whole string of victims we
don't know anything about,

26:40.686 --> 26:41.861
all the way back to Jersey

26:41.948 --> 26:44.037
where the letters were mailed.

26:44.124 --> 26:45.691
So we need
to know each stop that
they made along the way.

26:48.215 --> 26:49.303
<i>RYKER : </i>
Shut it down!

26:49.390 --> 26:51.000
What, all of it?

26:51.087 --> 26:52.828
There must be a dozen
DBCS machines down there.

26:52.915 --> 26:54.351
Yes, you need to
evacuate every employee and

26:54.438 --> 26:55.831
get them all on Cipro.

26:55.918 --> 26:56.919
We'd have
mountains of mail.

26:57.006 --> 26:58.921
It's a federal offense.

26:59.008 --> 27:00.183
I've contacted the CDC
and you should be hearing from

27:00.270 --> 27:01.576
the Governor any minute.

27:01.663 --> 27:02.621
This needs to
happen right now!

27:02.708 --> 27:04.579
The Governor?

27:04.666 --> 27:06.233
Your machines could be
spewing poison throughout...

27:06.320 --> 27:08.191
<i>RYKER : </i>
The entire building.

27:08.278 --> 27:09.410
<i>We already know of three </i>
letters full of anthrax have

27:09.497 --> 27:10.411
<i>passed through your equipment,</i>

27:10.498 --> 27:12.543
<i>there could be more.</i>

27:12.631 --> 27:14.937
The anthrax is
coming through the envelopes.

27:15.024 --> 27:17.374
One of your
employees was already
admitted into St. Francis.

27:17.461 --> 27:18.854
They found a
lesion on her arm.

27:18.941 --> 27:20.421
- Who?
- Angela Lowman.

27:20.508 --> 27:21.727
We're checking in
with another employee

27:21.814 --> 27:23.642
who might also be infected.

27:23.729 --> 27:25.905
I'm gonna have the
floor evacuated immediately.

27:27.994 --> 27:30.257
Inspector,
sorry to keep you waiting.

27:30.344 --> 27:32.302
Here's a copy of what
I faxed to your office.

27:32.389 --> 27:34.043
- Happy to help.
- Thank you.

27:34.130 --> 27:35.915
We shut down the Hamilton
facility in New Jersey.

27:36.002 --> 27:37.786
But what we need to know is
everywhere the letter went

27:37.873 --> 27:39.962
between there and
Senator Daschle's office.

27:40.049 --> 27:41.616
We need test
everyone along the way,

27:41.703 --> 27:43.618
so we just wanna know
how precise we can get.

27:43.705 --> 27:45.664
Well, you see
those series of hash marks?

27:45.751 --> 27:47.491
It's actually an
encoded time stamp.

27:47.578 --> 27:49.058
It traces a letter's path,

27:49.145 --> 27:50.625
marks every
facility it went through.

27:52.279 --> 27:53.367
- Huh.
- Oh, there we go.

27:55.499 --> 27:58.720
Okay, on October 9th,

27:58.807 --> 28:00.417
the envelope went through the

28:00.504 --> 28:01.941
Automatic Flats Canceling
and Sorting machine

28:02.028 --> 28:04.726
at Hamilton at 4:57 pm.

28:04.813 --> 28:09.165
At 5:15, it was encoded by a
DBCS machine according to its

28:09.252 --> 28:12.038
zip plus four, and sorted
into a mail bin that was

28:12.125 --> 28:14.910
loaded onto Truck number 468.

28:14.997 --> 28:18.784
The truck left Hamilton
at 7:18 am the next morning,

28:18.871 --> 28:20.524
and drove to Newark Airport,

28:20.611 --> 28:23.484
where it was loaded
on a USPS airliner.

28:23.571 --> 28:25.355
We need to
track down that driver,

28:25.442 --> 28:27.227
the pilot, and the co-pilot,
and those baggage handlers.

28:27.314 --> 28:29.055
Plane landed in D.C.

28:29.142 --> 28:30.883
on the night of the
October 10th, and from there,

28:30.970 --> 28:34.887
the letter went to
its final USPS stop...

28:34.974 --> 28:37.846
Brentwood.

28:37.933 --> 28:39.587
Brentwood's one of the
largest mail facilities on

28:39.674 --> 28:40.980
the East Coast.

28:41.067 --> 28:43.156
It employs
almost 2,000 workers.

28:43.243 --> 28:46.246
Can you
trace the exact machines
that letter went through?

28:46.333 --> 28:48.683
Just one.

28:48.770 --> 28:51.338
DBCS machine number 17.

28:51.425 --> 28:53.296
We need to get all
those workers out of there.

28:58.606 --> 28:59.999
What the...

29:00.086 --> 29:02.566
They didn't evacuate?

29:02.653 --> 29:04.177
How can they just let
these employees come to work

29:04.264 --> 29:07.397
in a contaminated space?

29:15.536 --> 29:16.493
I'm
looking for Jerry Reid.

29:16.580 --> 29:17.886
You found him.

29:17.973 --> 29:19.627
Special
Agent Ryker, FBI.

29:19.714 --> 29:21.194
This place should have
been evacuated hours ago.

29:21.281 --> 29:23.239
We got
your recommendation.

29:23.326 --> 29:27.853
We shut down DBCS 17 and I
passed it on up the chain,

29:27.940 --> 29:30.159
they said that was enough.

29:30.246 --> 29:33.162
Letters filled
with anthrax came
through here days ago.

29:33.249 --> 29:34.642
We've had two positive cases

29:34.729 --> 29:36.078
in a postal facility
in New Jersey.

29:36.165 --> 29:37.210
They shut down.

29:37.297 --> 29:38.820
Why haven't you?

29:38.907 --> 29:40.343
Hamilton is a
fraction of our size.

29:40.430 --> 29:42.215
We service the
entire U.S. Government,

29:42.302 --> 29:43.782
every embassy and...

29:43.869 --> 29:45.087
You need to
shut this place down.

29:47.002 --> 29:48.656
FBI doesn't have
carte blanche jurisdiction.

29:48.743 --> 29:50.440
Look, there's a whole
chain of heavy hitters above

29:50.527 --> 29:52.312
the two of us.

29:52.399 --> 29:53.574
What part of this
do you guys not understand?

29:53.661 --> 29:55.228
People are dying!

29:55.315 --> 29:58.144
Not postal workers.
They're all fine.

29:58.231 --> 30:01.974
You don't understand
what we do, what we are.

30:02.061 --> 30:04.411
Social Security checks,
mortgages.

30:04.498 --> 30:05.978
You don't let somebody's
house get foreclosed on,

30:06.065 --> 30:08.197
'cause they missed a payment?

30:08.284 --> 30:09.982
And what about the insulin
that's sitting in one of

30:10.069 --> 30:12.680
our carts on its
way to some diabetic?

30:12.767 --> 30:15.291
People's lives rely
on the postal service.

30:15.378 --> 30:16.684
We don't "shut down."

30:16.771 --> 30:18.729
Ever.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.122
What you're looking at on that
floor is an essential service.

30:20.209 --> 30:21.558
They're essential.

30:21.645 --> 30:23.299
Don't you
mean expendable?

30:26.389 --> 30:29.175
I may not have the authority
to evacuate your employees,

30:29.262 --> 30:31.046
but let's see how many of them
stick around when they start

30:31.133 --> 30:33.135
seeing a hazmat team
sweeping through.

30:35.442 --> 30:37.183
Rough pass first.

30:37.270 --> 30:39.750
Get suited up.

30:51.153 --> 30:53.025
What are
they all doing here?

30:55.723 --> 30:57.246
Excuse me?

30:57.333 --> 30:58.769
Uh, can you tell us
what is going on here?

30:58.857 --> 31:00.859
Is the floor
contaminated or something?

31:00.946 --> 31:02.251
We don't know yet,

31:02.338 --> 31:04.166
but I'm gonna be
honest with you.

31:04.253 --> 31:06.386
There are probably a few
workers here in this facility

31:06.473 --> 31:10.085
that have been
exposed to anthrax spores.

31:10.172 --> 31:12.609
Now, I'm trying to track
down anyone who's been sick,

31:12.696 --> 31:14.524
so we can get them help.

31:14.611 --> 31:15.743
Are you feeling
ill in any way?

31:15.830 --> 31:17.571
Not, not me.

31:17.658 --> 31:20.791
Somebody else then?

31:20.879 --> 31:24.491
Their best chance is
for us to get to them
as soon as possible.

31:26.667 --> 31:30.453
A friend of mine,
Louis Miller, he,

31:30.540 --> 31:33.892
he's never left mid-shift
his whole life until today.

31:33.979 --> 31:35.328
I'll give you his number.

31:35.415 --> 31:37.896
Please, yes.

31:37.983 --> 31:40.333
He wasn't home and
he isn't picking up his cell.

31:40.420 --> 31:42.335
<i>TORETTI : </i>
He wasn't at his
HMO's urgent care either.

31:42.422 --> 31:43.814
<i>I'm heading over </i>
to Central Hospital.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.294
All right.

31:45.381 --> 31:46.382
I'll tell you
what I find out here.

31:49.037 --> 31:50.691
I'm looking for a patient,

31:50.778 --> 31:53.259
African-American
male in his 40s.

31:53.346 --> 31:55.435
Place of employment is
the Brentwood Mail Facility.

31:55.522 --> 31:56.784
I have his name and
address right here.

31:56.871 --> 31:58.525
Is it Thomas Morris?

31:58.612 --> 31:59.961
Qieth McQue?

32:00.048 --> 32:01.745
I've also got a
Joseph Curseen.

32:01.832 --> 32:03.051
These men
all work at Brentwood?

32:03.138 --> 32:04.618
Yeah.

32:04.705 --> 32:06.054
And they're
all current patients?

32:06.141 --> 32:09.057
Two of
them are in the ICU,

32:09.144 --> 32:13.192
but Joe is in Room 311.

32:13.279 --> 32:14.541
Thank you.

32:19.676 --> 32:21.417
Hi.

32:21.504 --> 32:22.853
I'm looking for a patient,
he's a middle-aged man,

32:22.941 --> 32:24.594
African-American
named Louis Miller.

32:24.681 --> 32:25.769
He hasn't
seen a doctor yet.

32:25.856 --> 32:27.206
He's in the waiting area.

32:27.293 --> 32:28.511
Okay,
I need someone now.

32:30.209 --> 32:31.819
Louis Miller?

32:31.906 --> 32:33.342
Over here.

32:33.429 --> 32:34.778
Mr. Miller?

32:34.865 --> 32:36.258
From the
Brentwood Mail Facility?

32:36.345 --> 32:38.130
Yeah, what's,
what's going on?

32:38.217 --> 32:39.827
Are you experiencing
flu-like symptoms?

32:39.914 --> 32:41.960
Oh,
something's not right.

32:42.047 --> 32:44.875
I'm sorry, who are you?

32:44.963 --> 32:47.052
Dani Toretti, FBI,
we believe you may have been

32:47.139 --> 32:48.705
exposed to
anthrax at Brentwood,

32:48.792 --> 32:50.229
we just need to make sure.

32:50.316 --> 32:51.491
Okay.

32:51.578 --> 32:53.058
Chest X-ray and a spinal tap.

32:53.145 --> 32:54.581
It'll show that
Mr. Miller has anthrax.

32:54.668 --> 32:56.670
But first start him
on Cipro, right now.

32:56.757 --> 32:58.280
I'll get a doctor.

32:58.367 --> 32:59.281
Once we have
you on antibiotics,

32:59.368 --> 33:00.761
you should be okay.

33:00.848 --> 33:02.545
There
are others, you know,

33:02.632 --> 33:04.765
who've been sick
all of a sudden.

33:04.852 --> 33:06.854
Yeah. Yeah.
We know.

33:06.941 --> 33:08.290
Just give me one minute, okay?

33:10.727 --> 33:11.946
Ryker, I found him.

33:12.033 --> 33:13.556
We caught it just in time.

33:13.643 --> 33:14.993
<i>RYKER : </i>
No, we didn't.

33:15.080 --> 33:16.516
I just
found Joe Curseen.

33:16.603 --> 33:18.387
He works with Louis.

33:18.474 --> 33:20.563
He passed out in
church yesterday.

33:20.650 --> 33:21.738
<i>RYKER : By the </i>
time he got to the hospital,

33:21.825 --> 33:23.175
<i>it was already too late.</i>

33:23.262 --> 33:24.219
He's dead.

33:28.006 --> 33:30.399
All right, thanks.

33:42.629 --> 33:45.545
<i>MORRIS : </i>
My breathing is labored and
my chest feels constricted.

33:45.632 --> 33:47.764
<i>Uh, I am getting air, </i>
but just to get up and

33:47.851 --> 33:49.375
<i>walk and what have you.</i>

33:49.462 --> 33:51.899
<i>I feel like I </i>
might just pass out.

33:51.986 --> 33:52.639
<i>911 OPERATOR : </i>
And you said you work at
the post office?

33:52.726 --> 33:54.510
<i>Which one?</i>

33:54.597 --> 33:55.555
<i>MORRIS : </i>
The post office downtown,

33:55.642 --> 33:57.600
<i>Brentwood Road.</i>

33:57.687 --> 33:59.689
<i>They never let us know if </i>
that thing had anthrax or not.

33:59.776 --> 34:02.040
<i>The doctor thought it was </i>
just a virus or something,

34:02.127 --> 34:04.172
<i>so I was taking </i>
aspirin for the achiness.

34:04.259 --> 34:06.000
<i>But now there's the </i>
shortness of breath.

34:08.307 --> 34:11.701
The person who called
911 was one of your employees.

34:11.788 --> 34:13.486
Is he okay?

34:13.573 --> 34:14.878
Thomas Morris,

34:14.965 --> 34:17.229
he's dead.

34:17.316 --> 34:18.534
So is Joe Curseen.

34:22.234 --> 34:24.062
I don't
know what to say.

34:24.149 --> 34:25.367
Well, maybe there's a
reason the workers here call

34:25.454 --> 34:27.369
this place "The Plantation."

34:27.456 --> 34:28.892
Look, I shut the
machines down and started

34:28.979 --> 34:32.026
closing the place up
after you left here.

34:32.113 --> 34:35.290
My heart goes out
to them, their families.

34:35.377 --> 34:36.900
Your team knew
there could be anthrax here

34:36.987 --> 34:38.554
multiple shifts ago.

34:38.641 --> 34:40.469
We were assured
it wasn't a problem.

34:40.556 --> 34:42.428
I was following orders,
trusting the people who

34:42.515 --> 34:44.386
are supposed to
know more about this.

34:44.473 --> 34:45.909
"Supposed to"
doesn't mean anything to the

34:45.996 --> 34:47.781
people who have lost someone.

35:04.493 --> 35:06.321
Uh, it's
pretty straightforward.

35:06.408 --> 35:08.280
We examined the powder from
the Daschle letter under an

35:08.367 --> 35:11.457
electron microscope which can
magnify up to 2,000 times and

35:11.544 --> 35:12.806
identified the
augmentation and

35:12.893 --> 35:14.460
presence on a molecular level.

35:14.547 --> 35:16.462
Layman's terms.

35:16.549 --> 35:18.551
I'll have to
spell it out for them.

35:18.638 --> 35:20.857
We found that something
had been added to the spores.

35:20.944 --> 35:23.295
And based on
your expertise in anthrax,

35:23.382 --> 35:25.732
how certain are you about
what that substance is?

35:25.819 --> 35:27.125
Bentonite?

35:27.212 --> 35:29.127
100%.

35:29.214 --> 35:30.867
Will they know
what that means?

35:30.954 --> 35:32.608
They might not
understand microbiology,

35:32.695 --> 35:35.045
but they've read enough
intelligence briefings.

35:35.133 --> 35:38.266
There's only one
country we know of that's
added bentonite to anthrax.

35:38.353 --> 35:39.963
Iraq.

35:43.750 --> 35:46.535
You're not
answering your phone.

35:46.622 --> 35:48.494
I hadn't
slept since New York.

35:50.757 --> 35:52.585
I haven't eaten.
Do you mind?

35:52.672 --> 35:54.761
No, make
yourself right at home.

35:57.067 --> 35:58.286
Not exactly a meal.

36:01.420 --> 36:04.031
This is cozy.

36:04.118 --> 36:07.426
Well, I spend
a lot of time on the road.

36:07.513 --> 36:09.428
Sorry, I'm a little late.

36:09.515 --> 36:12.213
It's just, I have a, a dinner
date tonight and then I have a

36:12.300 --> 36:15.738
family birthday thing that
totally slipped my mind,

36:15.825 --> 36:19.046
kind of a two birds
with one stone situation.

36:20.439 --> 36:21.875
Who's the lucky girl?

36:21.962 --> 36:25.444
Is she the stone
or one of the birds?

36:25.531 --> 36:27.837
What are
you doing here again?

36:27.924 --> 36:30.405
They found
a hot drum full of mail,

36:30.492 --> 36:32.233
led them to
another anthrax letter.

36:32.320 --> 36:34.061
It's the one we
think infected Browning.

36:34.148 --> 36:37.543
- Who was the target?
- Senator Leahy.

36:37.630 --> 36:41.677
Leahy.
Judiciary Committee.

36:41.764 --> 36:43.940
Why wasn't it in the
mail from his office?

36:44.027 --> 36:46.378
The postal
machine misread the
handwritten zip code,

36:46.465 --> 36:48.075
so it ended up unopened,

36:48.162 --> 36:50.556
way down at the
State Department building.

36:50.643 --> 36:52.775
Which is a very good thing,
because it had triple the

36:52.862 --> 36:56.257
amount of powder than
the Daschle letter.

36:56.344 --> 36:58.738
That's enough spores
to kill thousands of people.

36:58.825 --> 37:00.435
No other hot spots?

37:00.522 --> 37:03.438
No, not
that they found so far.

37:03.525 --> 37:07.312
So then why
target Daschle and Leahy and

37:07.399 --> 37:08.791
then no one else?

37:08.878 --> 37:10.358
Two
Democratic Senators both

37:10.445 --> 37:12.882
needed to push the
Patriot Act through.

37:12.969 --> 37:14.101
Since when does
Al-Qaeda care about

37:14.188 --> 37:15.407
our internal politics?

37:15.494 --> 37:16.669
Is that what you're implying?

37:16.756 --> 37:17.713
I'm not implying.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.411
It's just a fact.

37:19.498 --> 37:21.195
This is the perfect storm
for a copycat after

37:21.282 --> 37:24.764
thousands of hoax letters
over the past few months.

37:24.851 --> 37:27.810
Clumsily we're just throwing
the blame on Al-Qaeda.

37:31.292 --> 37:32.641
Uncle Matty!

37:32.728 --> 37:34.382
Oh, hello, you.

37:34.469 --> 37:35.470
Happy birthday, girl!

37:35.557 --> 37:36.950
How are you?

37:37.037 --> 37:39.344
- Good.
- Yeah? All right.

37:39.431 --> 37:41.259
Hey, I like you to
meet my friend, Sheila.

37:41.346 --> 37:42.477
Hi.

37:42.564 --> 37:44.479
Hi, happy birthday.

37:44.566 --> 37:46.133
Look what I have.

37:46.220 --> 37:47.134
Look what I have here
for a special someone.

37:47.221 --> 37:48.788
Is it for me?

37:48.875 --> 37:50.137
It is for you,
would you like it now?

37:50.224 --> 37:51.138
- Yes.
- All right.

37:51.225 --> 37:52.270
Go ahead. Take it.

37:52.357 --> 37:53.749
Thank you.

37:53.836 --> 37:55.360
Wow.

37:55.447 --> 37:57.492
Valedictorian and
debate captain, huh?

37:57.579 --> 37:59.451
Yeah, welcome
to our time capsule.

38:01.148 --> 38:02.628
Oh, wow.

38:02.715 --> 38:04.107
How long did your dad serve?

38:04.194 --> 38:06.458
Uh, about six years.

38:06.545 --> 38:07.763
He actually
wanted to stay longer,

38:07.850 --> 38:08.982
but he got sick.

38:09.069 --> 38:10.636
Oh.

38:10.723 --> 38:12.377
Chemical exposure,
had to come home.

38:12.464 --> 38:14.248
I'm sorry.

38:14.335 --> 38:15.771
He looks really
happy in this picture.

38:15.858 --> 38:17.904
Ah, he was
smiling for the photo.

38:17.991 --> 38:19.819
It's my Mattie!

38:19.906 --> 38:21.473
Hi, mom.

38:21.560 --> 38:23.910
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Hey, you.

38:23.997 --> 38:25.259
Come on here, loser.

38:26.956 --> 38:28.480
Uh, Jenny, Mom,
I would love you to

38:28.567 --> 38:30.220
meet Sheila Willis.

38:30.308 --> 38:31.396
- Hi, Sheila.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

38:31.483 --> 38:32.832
So nice to meet you.

38:32.919 --> 38:34.964
Thank
you for inviting me.

38:35.051 --> 38:36.618
We just, uh,
we're dropping by
on our way to dinner.

38:36.705 --> 38:38.185
Oh, come on now,
we have plenty of food.

38:38.272 --> 38:40.013
Uh, actually,
we have a reservation.

38:40.100 --> 38:42.232
That's totally enough
time to get to know her.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.409
Oh.

38:44.496 --> 38:46.802
You'll have to
come over for dinner.

38:46.889 --> 38:49.414
Oh, um, I'd like that.
Thank you.

38:49.501 --> 38:50.589
So how long have you
two been seeing each other?

38:50.676 --> 38:52.417
Hey, I have an idea.

38:52.504 --> 38:53.679
How about we save the
third degree until after cake?

38:54.854 --> 38:56.551
Come on back.

38:56.638 --> 38:57.509
We're about to play
pin-the-tail-on-the <i>Shrek.</i>

38:57.596 --> 38:59.119
Okay.

38:59.206 --> 39:00.555
Which means
copious amounts of wine.

39:00.642 --> 39:01.904
- Oh.
- I like copious.

39:04.951 --> 39:05.865
Hey.

39:05.952 --> 39:06.996
Hey.

39:09.651 --> 39:11.697
<i>REPORTER : There </i>
are rumors circulating D.C.

39:11.784 --> 39:13.394
<i>about a possible war in...</i>

39:13.481 --> 39:14.830
Sorry I
missed your game.

39:14.917 --> 39:16.092
Didn't miss much.

39:16.179 --> 39:17.572
We got our asses handed to us.

39:17.659 --> 39:20.488
Dad thinks we
need a new coach.

39:20.575 --> 39:22.925
You heard
from him this week?

39:23.012 --> 39:24.318
Called from the base.

39:24.405 --> 39:25.972
Said there's talk.

39:26.059 --> 39:28.017
Maybe they're going to
get deployed to Iraq.

39:30.933 --> 39:33.936
If we go after Saddam,
will we even get Al-Qaeda?

39:34.023 --> 39:35.721
All the terrorists
who did all this?

39:40.552 --> 39:43.076
Your
dad's gonna be okay.

39:43.163 --> 39:45.078
Is that what
they train you to tell us?

39:55.305 --> 39:58.308
<i>REPORTER : </i>
Two more victims have
died of anthrax exposure.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.876
<i>Ottilie Lundgren </i>
and Kathy Nguyen.

40:00.963 --> 40:03.488
<i>Their cases are particularly </i>
troubling as they have

40:03.575 --> 40:05.446
<i>no connection to </i>
the media, politics,

40:05.533 --> 40:07.796
<i>or the U.S. Postal Service,</i>

40:07.883 --> 40:09.624
<i>which have so far </i>
been the targets.

40:14.586 --> 40:16.849
So you heard
about Lundgren and Nguyen?

40:16.936 --> 40:19.808
You're thinking
cross contamination?

40:19.895 --> 40:22.376
I just found out that
Lundgren had a letter that

40:22.463 --> 40:26.249
went through the
DBCS machine at Brentwood
15 seconds after Leahy's.

40:26.336 --> 40:27.686
Well,
your hunch was right.

40:27.773 --> 40:29.470
And that powder was so fine,

40:29.557 --> 40:30.776
it just blasted itself
all through those machines,

40:30.863 --> 40:32.299
so it makes sense.

40:35.302 --> 40:37.826
So tell me more
about your lone wolf theory.

40:39.785 --> 40:41.830
Finally
coming to your senses?

40:41.917 --> 40:44.093
My senses
aren't in question.

40:44.180 --> 40:45.704
I'm just curious.

40:45.791 --> 40:47.401
Okay.

40:47.488 --> 40:49.316
I've been working with
our handwriting analyst.

40:49.403 --> 40:52.058
We believe that the sender
tried to disguise his writing

40:52.145 --> 40:54.016
with this block lettering.

40:54.103 --> 40:56.628
Now, this is a penmanship
style that was taught to

40:56.715 --> 41:01.023
American schoolchildren from
the 1940s through the 1960s.

41:01.110 --> 41:02.721
American,
born and raised.

41:02.808 --> 41:05.201
Next up is this
"take penicillin" bit.

41:05.288 --> 41:07.813
Somebody knows
enough to reference
a specific antibiotic,

41:07.900 --> 41:09.684
but they don't
know how to spell it?

41:09.771 --> 41:12.382
And why would Al-Qaeda
warn their victims anyways?

41:12.470 --> 41:14.167
So "Allah is Great"
was a misdirect,

41:14.254 --> 41:15.603
to put the
focus on foreigners?

41:15.690 --> 41:17.866
Probably. Yeah.

41:17.953 --> 41:20.826
All signs point to
our perp being a highly
educated American citizen

41:20.913 --> 41:22.958
with scientific expertise.

41:23.045 --> 41:24.482
Most likely
works in isolation,

41:24.569 --> 41:26.309
suffers from mental illness.

41:26.396 --> 41:28.311
Someone
spurred by 9/11,

41:28.398 --> 41:30.749
which is why the first
letters bore that date,

41:30.836 --> 41:32.620
despite being mailed later.

41:32.707 --> 41:34.187
I drew up
this profile to send to

41:34.274 --> 41:36.755
the American Society
of Microbiology.

41:36.842 --> 41:41.107
I suspect one of
their members knows or

41:41.194 --> 41:43.109
is the anthrax mailer.

41:47.200 --> 41:49.202
It's risky,
tipping off a suspect.

41:49.289 --> 41:52.553
Or it's a very
smart way to smoke him out.

41:52.640 --> 41:54.120
How many
members are there?

41:54.207 --> 41:55.295
TORETTI: 30,000.

41:55.382 --> 41:56.862
And if we get any hits,

41:56.949 --> 41:59.081
we send field agents
out to do interviews.

41:59.168 --> 42:01.127
The Bureau's
interest is squarely
on terrorists, I doubt...

42:01.214 --> 42:03.521
I sent it through
my own channels already.

42:51.481 --> 42:53.135
Evening, Colonel.

42:53.222 --> 42:54.746
Got a call from
the Hill to commend you.

42:54.833 --> 42:56.748
Oh, I was
just doing my job, sir.

42:56.835 --> 42:58.750
Your name's
come up for commendations.

42:58.837 --> 43:01.187
I wouldn't be surprised to see
you decorated one of these days.

43:01.274 --> 43:02.971
You did a real service for
your country, Dr. Ivins.

43:03.058 --> 43:05.713
Oh.

43:05.800 --> 43:08.150
Well, that means
a lot to me, sir.

43:08.237 --> 43:09.848
Thank you.

43:09.935 --> 43:11.676
It's an honor, sir.
