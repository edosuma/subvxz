00:05.756 --> 00:07.968
Guys, for tonight's dinner
I have a surprise for you.

00:07.968 --> 00:10.591
I've taken another
cooking class
and I think this time

00:10.591 --> 00:12.303
you're really going
to like the result.

00:12.303 --> 00:13.844
Mom taking
another cooking class

00:13.844 --> 00:16.727
is like giving a chimp
another archery lesson.

00:16.727 --> 00:19.350
It's not going to turn out
better the second time.

00:19.350 --> 00:22.063
We're all very excited,
honey!

00:22.063 --> 00:23.774
Put some ice in your mouths.

00:23.774 --> 00:24.985
It'll numb the taste buds.

00:24.985 --> 00:26.737
And if that doesn't work,

00:26.737 --> 00:28.279
pretend this isn't happening
and you're somewhere else.

00:29.450 --> 00:31.742
Are you ready to eat?

00:31.742 --> 00:33.364
I'm at the water park.

00:33.364 --> 00:35.706
Whee!

00:35.706 --> 00:37.918
STAN: Ahh, here comes the part

00:37.918 --> 00:39.039
where they scrape
their plates under the table

00:39.039 --> 00:40.711
and I get to eat it.

00:40.711 --> 00:42.583
When I'm somewhere
I don't want to be,

00:42.583 --> 00:44.465
I imagine I'm right here.

00:44.465 --> 00:46.667
Whee!

00:46.667 --> 00:50.721
Our dinner of beef bourguignon
is about to begin-gnon.

00:52.133 --> 00:53.474
Good one, Ellen.

00:53.474 --> 00:55.766
Or should I say,
"Well done, Ellen."

00:55.766 --> 00:58.269
It's actually medium rare but
it was worth it for the joke.

01:01.272 --> 01:02.733
Isn't anyone gonna eat?

01:02.733 --> 01:04.775
Fine, I'll do it.

01:04.775 --> 01:06.687
It's been a good seven years.

01:06.687 --> 01:07.738
Remember me.

01:11.532 --> 01:13.784
Wow!
This is good!

01:14.825 --> 01:16.197
Wait.

01:16.197 --> 01:17.368
You're not just trying
to sucker us in, are you?

01:19.039 --> 01:20.461
Tongue out.

01:20.461 --> 01:22.703
Up, down, side.
Side.

01:22.703 --> 01:24.375
She's clean.

01:25.626 --> 01:26.917
Except for some plaque.

01:26.917 --> 01:28.919
Are you flossing
like Dr. Lasky told you to?

01:30.381 --> 01:32.052
Wow, this is amazing.

01:32.052 --> 01:34.215
Did I just walk
into the wrong house for dinner?

01:34.215 --> 01:36.427
Because I've done
that before.

01:36.427 --> 01:37.768
You know
what my problem was?

01:37.768 --> 01:39.180
I've been cooking by taste.

01:39.180 --> 01:40.811
It turns my taster's off.

01:40.811 --> 01:43.063
So this time I just followed
the recipe exactly

01:43.063 --> 01:45.566
instead of riffing on it
like a jazz artist--

01:45.566 --> 01:47.858
bippity boppity, blah, blah--
paprika.

01:49.490 --> 01:51.732
So this is how dinner
will always be?

01:51.732 --> 01:53.734
I can finally start to grow!

01:55.616 --> 01:57.328
STAN: Hey,
where's my floor food?

01:57.328 --> 02:00.541
What am I gonna vomit up
and eat later on?

02:00.541 --> 02:02.002
No leftovers?

02:02.002 --> 02:03.914
I'll show you.

02:03.914 --> 02:07.248
I'll start photobombing all
your precious family pictures.

02:07.248 --> 02:08.839
It might look
something like this.

02:26.267 --> 02:28.689
Avery, stop
whatever you're doing.
This is important.

02:28.689 --> 02:30.861
STAN: This is where
Tyler reminded Avery

02:30.861 --> 02:33.194
he had to choose between
going out with Nikki or Emily.

02:33.194 --> 02:35.986
And he chose Emily first
before realizing the mistake,

02:35.986 --> 02:37.698
which made Nikki really mad.

02:39.620 --> 02:41.332
And this is where Avery said
"I know, Tyler.

02:41.332 --> 02:42.783
I was there for all that."

02:42.783 --> 02:45.666
I know, Tyler.
I was there for all that.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.998
Then you know how much
Nikki means to me.

02:47.998 --> 02:50.631
Come on, you know,
that would have never lasted.

02:50.631 --> 02:52.713
You thought Emily was so great
and you got rid of her.

02:52.713 --> 02:54.715
Yeah, for Nikki!

02:54.715 --> 02:56.056
And what happens when someone
better than Nikki comes along?

02:56.056 --> 02:57.758
There's someone
better than Nikki?

02:57.758 --> 02:59.009
How awesome would that be?

03:00.641 --> 03:03.764
No, there's no one
better than Nikki.

03:03.764 --> 03:06.517
Tyler, you had your chance
with Nikki and you blew it.

03:06.517 --> 03:08.609
You might as well just
get over it and move on.

03:08.609 --> 03:11.362
Like you did after you blew
your chance with Wes?

03:11.362 --> 03:12.903
That's totally different!

03:12.903 --> 03:15.366
I've determined through
a very scientific system

03:15.366 --> 03:16.987
that Wes and I
are meant to be together.

03:18.949 --> 03:21.952
Dang it! Not again.

03:21.952 --> 03:23.914
Well, Nikki and I
are meant to be together.

03:23.914 --> 03:25.205
But she won't talk to me,

03:25.205 --> 03:26.877
she won't return
any of my texts,

03:26.877 --> 03:29.710
and when I see her in public
and say "Nikki, what's up?"

03:29.710 --> 03:31.211
She just whips
her hair around in a mean

03:31.211 --> 03:32.833
but still
very attractive way.

03:34.134 --> 03:35.836
You're one of her
best friends.

03:35.836 --> 03:37.298
You have to get her
to forgive me.

03:37.298 --> 03:39.840
Tyler, you're my brother,
she's my friend.

03:39.840 --> 03:41.512
Are you really asking me
to get in the middle

03:41.512 --> 03:43.724
of some awkward situation
between you two?

03:43.724 --> 03:45.346
Yes, would you?

03:45.346 --> 03:47.728
No!
I will not talk to her for you.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.109
When things go wrong,

03:49.109 --> 03:50.651
the person in the middle
always ends up

03:50.651 --> 03:52.112
with everyone else
mad at them.

03:52.112 --> 03:54.234
I don't want to become
the recipient of that mean,

03:54.234 --> 03:55.736
but attractive hair whip.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.658
Yes, I've noticed it, too.

03:57.658 --> 04:00.070
Nothing will go wrong
with me and Nikki.

04:00.070 --> 04:01.121
This is difference.

04:01.121 --> 04:02.913
It's already gone wrong.

04:02.913 --> 04:04.575
She said she didn't want
to hang out

04:04.575 --> 04:06.166
with me this afternoon
because you'd be here.

04:06.166 --> 04:08.629
Yearn!

04:08.629 --> 04:10.170
That's my dart,
that's for me!

04:10.170 --> 04:11.171
I'm counting it!

04:11.171 --> 04:12.583
Yes!

04:12.583 --> 04:13.964
Thank you, Tyler,
for helping me with Wes.

04:18.299 --> 04:19.680
We're back.

04:19.680 --> 04:21.642
Bought a couple of things
at the cooking store.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.476
That's okay, I got it.

04:27.808 --> 04:29.810
Honey, why do you need
a blender,

04:29.810 --> 04:31.442
a juicer,
a smoothie maker,

04:31.442 --> 04:33.484
and a food processor?

04:33.484 --> 04:35.316
Aren't they all basically
the same thing?

04:35.316 --> 04:36.657
If they were the same thing,

04:36.657 --> 04:37.858
they wouldn't have
different names.

04:37.858 --> 04:40.571
I'm pretty sure.

04:40.571 --> 04:42.573
Well, all I can say
is last night after dinner,

04:42.573 --> 04:45.786
my stomach was pumped
and not by a paramedic,

04:45.786 --> 04:47.668
I mean in a good way.

04:47.668 --> 04:50.621
"Oh, yeah!
It stayed down!"

04:52.583 --> 04:53.834
That's okay, I got it.

04:56.837 --> 04:58.008
Hey, Stan.

04:58.008 --> 05:00.010
Hey, Eggs Benedict Arnold.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.013
I don't get that.

05:03.013 --> 05:04.635
Well you see,
Benedict Arnold was

05:04.635 --> 05:06.186
a Revolutionary War traitor

05:06.186 --> 05:08.349
and eggs benedict
is a chichi breakfast dish

05:08.349 --> 05:09.730
served with
hollandaise sauce.

05:09.730 --> 05:11.932
So what I did there was
I combined them to imply

05:11.932 --> 05:13.774
that you're a food traitor.

05:13.774 --> 05:15.195
Ohhhh.

05:15.195 --> 05:16.276
Let's start over.

05:16.276 --> 05:18.198
Hey, Eggs Benedict Arnold.

05:18.198 --> 05:20.651
Hey, that's hurtful.

05:20.651 --> 05:23.534
Yeah, it is.
I didn't get any leftovers.

05:23.534 --> 05:26.367
You and the rest
of those table jockeys
hogged all the food.

05:26.367 --> 05:28.709
Tonight I'll slip you a little
something under the table.

05:28.709 --> 05:30.661
I don't want
a little something.

05:30.661 --> 05:32.373
I want what I used to get.

05:32.373 --> 05:33.544
All of it.

05:33.544 --> 05:34.755
You see my problem here,
Eggs?

05:36.507 --> 05:38.509
We can't give you
all of it, Stan.

05:38.509 --> 05:40.340
Now that it's good,
we want some food.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.762
"We want some food."

05:41.762 --> 05:43.514
Do you even hear
how selfish you sound?

05:44.725 --> 05:47.558
I can't even look at you.

05:47.558 --> 05:49.099
Why don't you go ahead
and pet behind my ears?

05:53.684 --> 05:55.396
Will Wes ask me out.

05:55.396 --> 05:56.397
What!

05:57.648 --> 05:59.690
Will Wes ask me out?

05:59.690 --> 06:01.782
Come on, I thought
I wrote "yes" on all these!

06:02.743 --> 06:04.575
Okay, okay.

06:04.575 --> 06:07.618
Wes won't ask me out,
right?

06:07.618 --> 06:09.660
You don't know
Wes like I do!

06:10.991 --> 06:13.373
Avery, Tyler's not here,
is he?

06:13.373 --> 06:14.625
Oh, no, he left

06:14.625 --> 06:16.336
because my Student Tolerance
Club is coming over.

06:16.336 --> 06:17.668
He hates them

06:17.668 --> 06:19.129
and the Tolerance Club
hates him.

06:19.129 --> 06:20.841
The irony is delicious,
isn't it?

06:24.264 --> 06:25.265
To me. To me.

06:26.847 --> 06:29.009
I don't know
what to do about Tyler.

06:29.009 --> 06:31.472
I really liked him,
and maybe I still do.

06:31.472 --> 06:34.815
But when he picked Emily first,
it really hurt me.

06:34.815 --> 06:37.728
And now I'm just
so confused.

06:37.728 --> 06:39.610
Should I give him
another chance?

06:39.610 --> 06:41.732
Nikki, you're my friend,
Tyler's my brother.

06:41.732 --> 06:43.023
I don't want to get
in the middle.

06:43.023 --> 06:44.364
Just do whatever feels
right to you.

06:44.364 --> 06:45.786
I don't know
what feels right.

06:45.786 --> 06:47.788
This is all so new to me.

06:47.788 --> 06:49.790
I've never been confused
about boys.

06:49.790 --> 06:51.241
I've never been
picked second.

06:51.241 --> 06:53.624
Not even for softball,
and I don't know how to play.

06:54.835 --> 06:56.627
Please, Avery.

06:56.627 --> 06:58.799
You're my friend,
I really need your help.

06:58.799 --> 07:00.591
Okay, fine.

07:00.591 --> 07:02.252
You know, I probably
shouldn't be saying any of this,

07:02.252 --> 07:04.344
but you dodged a bullet.

07:04.344 --> 07:06.216
Tyler just goes
from girl to girl.

07:06.216 --> 07:07.548
And you would have
ended up getting hurt

07:07.548 --> 07:08.929
when he left you
for someone better.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.430
There's someone better
than me?

07:11.722 --> 07:12.893
The point is,

07:12.893 --> 07:14.725
Tyler's probably
in the park right now

07:14.725 --> 07:17.107
doing tricks on his bike
to impress the next girl

07:17.107 --> 07:18.519
whose heart
he's gonna break.

07:18.519 --> 07:20.320
Having him as a boyfriend
would be

07:20.320 --> 07:22.442
a horrible, horrible,
horrible, horrible--

07:22.442 --> 07:23.484
Wait,
how many is that?

07:23.484 --> 07:25.275
Four.
Horrible mistake.

07:26.827 --> 07:28.028
You're right.

07:28.028 --> 07:29.620
That is just what
I needed to hear.

07:29.620 --> 07:32.783
Thanks to you, I am going
to get over Tyler and move on.

07:32.783 --> 07:35.536
That fifth "horrible"
really drove the point home.

07:38.418 --> 07:41.502
Will I find
the perfect boy?

07:41.502 --> 07:42.503
"Yes."

07:42.503 --> 07:43.844
Oh, that's for me!

07:43.844 --> 07:44.635
I'm counting it!

07:44.635 --> 07:46.046
Yes!

07:46.046 --> 07:47.548
Thank you, Nikki,
for helping me with Wes.

07:51.642 --> 07:54.264
Look, this is just
what I told Nikki!

07:54.264 --> 07:56.226
He's already moving on
to the next girl.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.098
I wonder which one of those
unlucky contestants

07:58.098 --> 07:59.900
will be his girlfriend
by the end of the day.

07:59.900 --> 08:02.232
Will it be Giggly?
Clappy?

08:02.232 --> 08:04.024
Or Thumbs-up Gal?

08:07.027 --> 08:10.611
Ah, here it comes,
one of Tyler's classic moves.

08:10.611 --> 08:12.112
He's gonna do a bike trick,

08:12.112 --> 08:14.164
and then fall on to one of them
so she has to catch him

08:14.164 --> 08:15.876
as he puts his arm
around her.

08:15.876 --> 08:17.788
"Whoa, thanks.

08:17.788 --> 08:20.621
Can I buy you a smoothie
for saving my life?"

08:34.555 --> 08:35.896
He didn't flirt with them.

08:35.896 --> 08:36.937
That's weird.

08:36.937 --> 08:38.769
I'm gonna go talk to him.

08:38.769 --> 08:40.771
I'm gonna go cheer up Tyler's
rejects by letting them pet me.

08:40.771 --> 08:43.023
It's one of those
"everybody wins" situations.

08:45.736 --> 08:49.239
Hey, Tyler, those were
some pretty cute girls.

08:49.239 --> 08:50.861
What happened
to the "fall and hug"?

08:50.861 --> 08:52.573
What?

08:52.573 --> 08:55.415
Oh, you mean
the "trip and trap."

08:55.415 --> 08:58.118
I told you, all I can
think about is Nikki.

08:58.118 --> 08:59.870
I thought maybe if I rode
my bike a little,

08:59.870 --> 09:01.582
it'd clear my head.

09:01.582 --> 09:02.753
But it's not working.

09:02.753 --> 09:06.587
( playing music )

09:06.587 --> 09:08.428
Great, and now
they're playing our song.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.672
Circus music is your song?

09:11.672 --> 09:13.053
It's the fro-yo cart.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.224
It would always come
by our house

09:14.224 --> 09:15.385
on the way
to passing Nikki's

09:15.385 --> 09:16.677
and I'd text her

09:16.677 --> 09:18.518
and we'd meet in the middle
and get fro-yo.

09:18.518 --> 09:21.812
It was our thing.

09:21.812 --> 09:23.734
But now that's the saddest song
I've ever heard.

09:25.606 --> 09:27.988
Tyler, I know you told me
that you're hung up on Nikki,

09:27.988 --> 09:30.821
but it's just not like you
to actually...

09:30.821 --> 09:33.614
have feelings.

09:33.614 --> 09:36.997
I know.
Where did they come from
and how do you get rid of them?

09:36.997 --> 09:39.039
Do you feel feelings
all the time?

09:39.039 --> 09:40.751
Yeah.

09:40.751 --> 09:43.253
I am so sorry.

09:45.005 --> 09:46.967
You know, I've heard
the expression "heartbroken,"

09:46.967 --> 09:49.419
but I never thought
it was real.

09:49.419 --> 09:52.092
And my heart actually hurts.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.845
And my stomach.
And my head.

09:54.845 --> 09:56.847
I'm "everything-broken,"
Avery.

10:02.392 --> 10:04.104
STAN: Oh, man,
Clappy really knows

10:04.104 --> 10:06.066
how to get
into the undercoat.

10:12.442 --> 10:14.284
So I got your text
that Tyler's not here

10:14.284 --> 10:15.615
and you wanted
to talk to me.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.198
Oh, thanks again
for that wonderful advise.

10:18.198 --> 10:20.000
I really feel like
I'm starting to move on.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.662
About that...

10:21.662 --> 10:24.875
I may have made a horrible,
horrible, horrible, horrible--

10:24.875 --> 10:26.667
Wait, how many
did I say before?

10:26.667 --> 10:29.169
Five.
Horrible mistake.

10:29.169 --> 10:31.051
You need to give Tyler
another chance.

10:31.051 --> 10:33.423
Avery, you told me
not to go out with him.

10:33.423 --> 10:34.634
Now you're telling me
I should.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.636
We have an expression
in my country:

10:36.636 --> 10:38.809
don't change airplanes
before they land.

10:38.809 --> 10:40.971
And also, don't change
airplanes in Chicago.

10:40.971 --> 10:42.853
O'Hare's a mess.

10:42.853 --> 10:45.726
I've never seen Tyler
like this before.

10:45.726 --> 10:47.437
He actually has
feelings for you.

10:47.437 --> 10:49.269
I didn't even think
he could have feelings.

10:49.269 --> 10:51.982
I wrote a paper on him for my
abnormal psychology project

10:51.982 --> 10:54.114
called "The Boy
Who Only Loved His Hair."

10:55.115 --> 10:56.116
I got an A.

10:56.116 --> 10:58.829
He got a home visit.

10:58.829 --> 11:01.041
Avery, I came to you
because I was confused

11:01.041 --> 11:02.662
and you helped me.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.045
Because of you,
I decided to forget about Tyler.

11:05.045 --> 11:06.286
I'm trying to move on,

11:06.286 --> 11:07.667
but now you're
confusing me again.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.170
No, you can't forget
about Tyler because of me.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.092
I don't want that.
Tyler's my brother.

11:12.092 --> 11:13.343
So are you talking to me

11:13.343 --> 11:15.345
as Tyler's sister
or as my friend?

11:15.345 --> 11:17.177
This is why I didn't want
to get in the middle!

11:17.177 --> 11:18.678
Then maybe
you shouldn't have!

11:18.678 --> 11:19.930
Tyler is wrong
and I'm right!

11:19.930 --> 11:22.142
Wait a minute,
there's a reason

11:22.142 --> 11:23.854
he went to Emily first

11:23.854 --> 11:25.896
and wasn't sure he could trust
that you really liked him.

11:25.896 --> 11:27.978
You weren't interested in him
till he had a girlfriend.

11:27.978 --> 11:30.610
Ah!
So you are taking his side!

11:30.610 --> 11:31.732
I'm taking the side that

11:31.732 --> 11:33.613
you should give him
another chance"!

11:33.613 --> 11:35.115
I just can't let things go
when they're wrong.

11:35.115 --> 11:36.696
And this has been bothering me
since you came in.

11:36.696 --> 11:37.738
Stupid thread.

11:39.029 --> 11:40.160
Ah!

11:42.032 --> 11:43.323
Let me fix that.

11:44.624 --> 11:46.326
Sweater vests are in.

11:46.326 --> 11:47.707
Show off those arms, girl.

11:49.790 --> 11:51.291
You don't know
when to butt out.

11:51.291 --> 11:53.043
( speaking in
foreign language )

11:53.043 --> 11:55.675
STAN: I know absolutely
no Spanish, but I can infer

11:55.675 --> 11:57.798
from the situation
that she's saying,

11:57.798 --> 12:00.340
"Your dog is
remarkably handsome and..."

12:00.340 --> 12:02.302
( speaking in
foreign language )

12:03.343 --> 12:04.845
"Smart."

12:06.266 --> 12:09.059
The Master Chef is home
to cook dinner!

12:09.059 --> 12:11.441
Yay! Heat it up!

12:11.441 --> 12:13.063
I thought that could be
your new catch phrase.

12:13.063 --> 12:15.565
Actually,
my belly came up with it.

12:15.565 --> 12:17.357
Heat it up!

12:18.618 --> 12:21.531
Now, heat up
is too microwavey.

12:21.531 --> 12:22.953
I thought it was good,
buddy.

12:24.414 --> 12:27.247
How about "It's on!"?

12:27.247 --> 12:30.670
"It" could be the heat,
or what I'm doing with it.

12:30.670 --> 12:32.793
Either way, "It's on!"

12:34.044 --> 12:37.257
I like yours better.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.639
Well, this is usually when
I have my secret pre-dinner.

12:39.639 --> 12:41.641
I don't know
what to do with myself.

12:41.641 --> 12:44.845
Oh, I should
probably tell Linda
at the diner I'm okay.

12:44.845 --> 12:46.436
She worries.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.689
If I'm gonna have
a catchphrase,

12:49.689 --> 12:51.812
I should probably have
a theme song.

12:51.812 --> 12:55.655
♪ I'm on, he's on,
you're on, she's on ♪

12:55.655 --> 12:57.657
♪ They're on, we's on ♪

12:57.657 --> 12:59.609
♪ It's on! ♪

12:59.609 --> 13:01.571
The heat
or what I'm doing with it.

13:03.033 --> 13:05.285
STAN: Now to sabotage
the meal.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.118
Twice as long
equals twice as bad.

13:08.118 --> 13:11.291
Casual. Casual. Casual.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.292
Hi, Stan.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.713
Totally worked.

13:15.335 --> 13:19.509
Add a pinch of bay leaves.

13:19.509 --> 13:23.223
And a handful of elm leaves
I found in the yard.

13:25.765 --> 13:26.766
Stan?

13:28.228 --> 13:30.230
Still casual.

13:30.230 --> 13:31.731
Is something going on?

13:31.731 --> 13:34.104
You were in that chair,
now you're in this chair.

13:34.104 --> 13:35.856
But you look so casual.

13:37.237 --> 13:38.738
Exactly.

13:38.738 --> 13:41.701
I've crawled into your mind
and set up a tent.

13:41.701 --> 13:44.654
A casual tent.

13:44.654 --> 13:47.117
And now
to add some seasoning.

13:47.117 --> 13:49.829
Sweaty tube socks.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.711
Picked fresh
from Tyler's gym bag,

13:51.711 --> 13:53.663
delivered straight
to your table.

13:53.663 --> 13:55.755
Now with
errant Band-Aid.

13:56.877 --> 13:58.718
( speaking in
foreign language )

14:00.340 --> 14:01.671
Nikki! Calm down.

14:01.671 --> 14:02.722
I have no idea
what you're saying.

14:02.722 --> 14:04.844
When I get upset,
I rant in Spanish.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.136
Which is what
I was just saying to you

14:06.136 --> 14:08.388
in Spanish.

14:08.388 --> 14:10.560
When you're ready
to stop taking Tyler's side

14:10.560 --> 14:13.603
and be my friend again,
let me know.

14:13.603 --> 14:14.814
Nikki, what's up?

14:18.778 --> 14:22.152
Wow! That hear whip
really is mean but attractive.

14:22.152 --> 14:23.783
So what was she doing here?

14:23.783 --> 14:25.035
Did she say
anything about me?

14:25.035 --> 14:26.446
Well, sort of.

14:26.446 --> 14:28.828
She said some things
about you, about me,

14:28.828 --> 14:30.410
about how I don't know
when to butt out.

14:30.410 --> 14:33.543
I also think you don't know
when to butt out.

14:33.543 --> 14:36.126
We have
so much in common.

14:36.126 --> 14:38.919
Wait, why does she think
you don't know when to butt out?

14:38.919 --> 14:40.760
When I saw
that you really were hurting,

14:40.760 --> 14:41.922
I wanted to tell her

14:41.922 --> 14:43.383
that I was wrong
about what I said before.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.305
What did you say before?

14:46.766 --> 14:49.769
Before today,
I've said so many things.

14:49.769 --> 14:51.011
I talk a lot,
if you haven't noticed.

14:51.011 --> 14:52.772
Frequently on the subject
of current events.

14:52.772 --> 14:54.724
That omnibus bill stuck
in the Senate right now--

14:54.724 --> 14:55.815
Avery!

14:56.816 --> 14:58.108
What did you say?

14:58.108 --> 15:00.690
Okay, I may have made

15:00.690 --> 15:03.443
a horrible, horrible,
horrible, horrible--

15:03.443 --> 15:05.405
ny was that?
Two?

15:05.405 --> 15:07.327
Okay, I definitely know
it's not that.

15:07.327 --> 15:10.030
The point is,
I made a mistake.

15:10.030 --> 15:11.661
STAN: And this is where
Avery told Tyler

15:11.661 --> 15:13.493
that she told Nikki
not to go out with him.

15:13.493 --> 15:14.744
Then she told Nikki
to go out with him.

15:14.744 --> 15:16.836
But Nikki was
determined to move on

15:16.836 --> 15:18.088
they got
in a big argument,

15:18.088 --> 15:19.499
and now she's really mad
at Avery.

15:21.881 --> 15:23.503
Why did I do that?

15:23.503 --> 15:24.844
I don't know
my own strength.

15:24.844 --> 15:27.427
Or the weakness
of today's sweaters.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.389
You've ripped
the sleeves off my heart.

15:29.389 --> 15:30.470
Your sweater will be okay,

15:30.470 --> 15:32.642
but what about
my heart sleeves?

15:34.054 --> 15:35.685
So we actually had
a shot with Nikki

15:35.685 --> 15:37.227
when she talked to you
the first time,

15:37.227 --> 15:38.318
and you blew it for me.

15:38.318 --> 15:39.819
I'm sorry, Tyler.

15:39.819 --> 15:42.322
I tried to change her mind back,
but she's moving on.

15:42.322 --> 15:43.733
You're a terrible sister

15:43.733 --> 15:45.115
and I'll never forgive you
for this!

15:45.115 --> 15:46.656
This is why I didn't want
to get in the middle!

15:46.656 --> 15:47.907
Then maybe
you shouldn't have!

15:47.907 --> 15:49.409
That's exactly
what Nikki said.

15:49.409 --> 15:51.031
We have
so much in common.

15:56.376 --> 15:58.748
I'm so mad at you
for what you said to Nikki.

15:58.748 --> 16:00.170
I'm not talking to you.

16:00.170 --> 16:02.042
You talked to me
to tell me that.

16:02.042 --> 16:03.843
I can do whatever I want.
I'm the mad one.

16:07.467 --> 16:10.890
As I always say,
"It's on!"

16:10.890 --> 16:12.302
All right, stomach.

16:12.302 --> 16:13.683
Are you ready for this?

16:13.683 --> 16:17.147
Oh, I'm ready, Chloe.

16:17.147 --> 16:19.149
Sweetheart,
that's Daddy's bit.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.482
STAN: Excellent.

16:22.482 --> 16:23.773
Now I'm just waiting
for the food

16:23.773 --> 16:25.775
to drop like a ball
on New Year's Eve.

16:25.775 --> 16:28.488
Ten, nine, eight...

16:28.488 --> 16:30.660
( all spitting )

16:30.660 --> 16:32.782
What? What's wrong?
It's not good?

16:32.782 --> 16:34.664
Maybe the guy standing
in the corner likes it.

16:37.077 --> 16:39.959
STAN: Happy New Year.

16:39.959 --> 16:42.832
Oh no, you're feeding it
to the dog again.

16:42.832 --> 16:45.125
I don't understand.
I followed the recipe exactly.

16:45.125 --> 16:46.716
Why was tonight different?

16:46.716 --> 16:49.339
Stan.

16:49.339 --> 16:53.303
Hon, maybe the real question
is why was last night different?

16:53.303 --> 16:55.135
Maybe last night
was a fluke.

16:55.135 --> 16:57.187
No, tonight was the fluke.

16:57.187 --> 16:58.978
I'm gonna try again tomorrow
and you'll see.

16:58.978 --> 17:00.270
I'm gonna make
a great meal.

17:00.270 --> 17:01.691
You're right.

17:01.691 --> 17:03.813
I'm gonna go to the diner--
not to eat,

17:03.813 --> 17:05.405
just to tell Linda
about how great

17:05.405 --> 17:07.067
tomorrow night's
dinner's gonna be.

17:07.067 --> 17:08.648
Hey, kids, do you want
to come with me?

17:08.648 --> 17:10.780
I love Aunt Linda!

17:10.780 --> 17:13.243
And I'm gonna go
look up recipes for tomorrow.

17:13.243 --> 17:16.366
STAN: Don't worry,
I'm gonna ruin that, too.

17:16.366 --> 17:18.578
Oh, did I say that out loud?
What?

17:18.578 --> 17:20.540
Oh, I guess
I didn't say it out loud.

17:20.540 --> 17:24.254
It was "Don't worry,
I'm gonna ruin that, too."

17:24.254 --> 17:25.795
No way, Stan.

17:25.795 --> 17:28.168
I'm not letting you ruin
tomorrow night's dinner.

17:28.168 --> 17:30.009
Fine, then we'll see
who wins.

17:30.009 --> 17:31.221
Loser says "what?"

17:31.221 --> 17:32.552
( mumbles )
What?

17:32.552 --> 17:33.843
Ha!
Dang it!

17:34.934 --> 17:36.806
I'm in second grade.

Hi, Chloe.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.196
Hi, Mommy.

18:06.836 --> 18:10.420
Oh, isn't that cute?

18:15.054 --> 18:17.217
STAN: Add a little fur.

18:17.217 --> 18:18.718

18:30.029 --> 18:31.491
He really
isn't feeling well.

18:31.491 --> 18:33.573
He says his stomach hurts,
he can't eat.

18:33.573 --> 18:34.654
I think it's going
to be a while

18:34.654 --> 18:36.786
before he recovers
from this one.

18:36.786 --> 18:38.828
He said he was
"inside sad" --

18:38.828 --> 18:42.292
like a chimp
who can communicate.

18:42.292 --> 18:44.914
STAN: Oh no, Tyler must have
gotten sick from the food

18:44.914 --> 18:46.706
I sabotaged last night.

18:46.706 --> 18:48.628
Well, I'm gonna head out
into the garage

18:48.628 --> 18:52.752
and organize my drill bits
and wrenches and stuff--

18:52.752 --> 18:54.634
I don't hide food
out there or anything.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.427
Well, Bennett, save room.

18:57.427 --> 18:58.678
Dinner's gonna be
good tonight.

18:58.678 --> 19:00.470
It is still very much on!

19:02.061 --> 19:03.763
Chloe, what have I done?

19:03.763 --> 19:06.145
Messing with Ellen's cooking
made Tyler sick.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.858
No, Stan, he's not jacked up
'cause of the food,

19:08.858 --> 19:10.530
he's jacked up
'cause of Nikki.

19:10.530 --> 19:13.863
Oh, wow, I'm so glad
my sabotage didn't hurt Tyler.

19:13.863 --> 19:16.366
But it could have.
What was I doing?

19:16.366 --> 19:19.409
You were being a dog.
You like table scraps,

19:19.409 --> 19:20.950
kind of makes sense.

19:20.950 --> 19:23.373
No, no, no, you can't let me
off the hook like that.

19:23.373 --> 19:25.875
At least give me
a "bad dog" or something.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.628
Bad dog, Stan!

19:28.628 --> 19:30.630
Whoa!
That was a little harsh, Chloe.

19:30.630 --> 19:31.921
Where did that come from?

19:35.345 --> 19:38.928
( playing music )

19:55.735 --> 19:58.318
Nikki, I have to talk to you.

19:58.318 --> 20:00.660
Don't run away...

20:00.660 --> 20:03.082
and don't attractively
mean-whip your hair.

20:03.082 --> 20:05.535
I'll just yell
for the whole park to hear.

20:06.586 --> 20:08.588
Fine. What?

20:08.588 --> 20:09.919
I was sitting at my house

20:09.919 --> 20:12.792
and the fro-yo cart
came by playing that song,

20:12.792 --> 20:14.754
and I wanted
to text you so bad,

20:14.754 --> 20:16.005
because that's what
we used to do

20:16.005 --> 20:17.717
when we were friends.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.719
And I miss that so much.

20:21.931 --> 20:24.394
I don't even care if you
don't want to be my girlfriend.

20:24.394 --> 20:25.805
Well, okay, I care

20:25.805 --> 20:27.106
'cause I'm not stupid
and you're great.

20:28.608 --> 20:31.401
But I can't stand
not having you in my life.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.404
Even if I can't be
your boyfriend,

20:34.404 --> 20:36.235
I want us
to be friends again.

20:38.858 --> 20:40.410
Oh, Tyler.

20:44.033 --> 20:45.365
So we're friends again?

20:45.365 --> 20:46.996
No, I don't want
to be your friend.

20:46.996 --> 20:49.208
Then why would you hug someone
and kiss them like that

20:49.208 --> 20:51.631
if you didn't want to be their--
Ohhh.

20:53.713 --> 20:54.924
( playing music )

20:54.924 --> 20:57.216
Oh, they're playing
our song.

21:12.982 --> 21:14.273
Oh, good.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.445
I thought you guys
would be in here.

21:15.445 --> 21:16.696
I heard your song.

21:16.696 --> 21:20.199
( hums circus music )

21:20.199 --> 21:23.202
Hey, thanks, Avery,
for trying to help.

21:23.202 --> 21:25.284
Yes, thank you, Avery.
I'm very happy.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.616
I'm happier.

21:26.616 --> 21:28.167
I'm happier.

21:28.167 --> 21:29.619
You couldn't be
happier than me.

21:29.619 --> 21:31.751
You couldn't be
happier than me.

21:31.751 --> 21:34.964
Oh, what have I done?

21:34.964 --> 21:37.377
Horrible, horrible,
horrible, horrible...

21:37.377 --> 21:38.678
BOTH: Aah!

21:38.678 --> 21:39.839
Horrible.

21:42.091 --> 21:43.683
STAN: So, Tyler and Nikki
figured out

21:43.683 --> 21:45.304
what's important to them,

21:45.304 --> 21:47.687
and I remembered
what's important to me.

21:47.687 --> 21:51.020
Not the food passed to me
under the table,

21:51.020 --> 21:53.483
but the people
sitting around it.

21:54.524 --> 21:56.105
So what do you think?

21:56.105 --> 21:58.027
I finally got so bored
following the recipes,

21:58.027 --> 22:00.610
I had to go back to
my jazz cooking ways.

22:00.610 --> 22:02.862
Bippity-bop-bop-bop,
cilantro.

22:04.404 --> 22:06.115
Oh, yeah.
You did it again, hon.

22:06.115 --> 22:08.658
Another great meal,
mom.

22:08.658 --> 22:10.329
We should tell Linda
about it!

22:10.329 --> 22:11.371
Yes.

22:11.371 --> 22:12.502
Oh, yeah.

22:12.502 --> 22:13.543
Now that I'm dating Nikki.

22:13.543 --> 22:14.714
I have something
to live for.

22:14.714 --> 22:15.715
Oh, we'll tell Linda.

22:15.715 --> 22:16.876
She's been rooting
for you guys.

22:19.759 --> 22:22.382
Well, Stan,
I guess it's just you and me.

22:22.382 --> 22:23.763
You want some table scraps?

22:23.763 --> 22:26.676
Way ahead of you.

22:26.676 --> 22:28.057
Just push all the food
in front of me

22:28.057 --> 22:29.559
and turn your back.

22:29.559 --> 22:31.731
This is not gonna
be pretty.
