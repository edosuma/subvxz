WEBVTT

00:03.470 --> 00:04.771
- PREVIOUSLY ON<i>MILLION DOLLAR</i>
<i>LISTING NEW YORK...</i>

00:04.804 --> 00:05.772
- WHAT PRICE
DO YOU HAVE IN MIND?

00:05.805 --> 00:07.774
- 10.5?

00:07.807 --> 00:09.576
- JEWEL IS, TO ME,
AN UNREALISTIC SELLER.

00:11.711 --> 00:13.646
- IT MIGHT BE WORTH ME
JUST, LIKE, WAITING.

00:13.680 --> 00:14.748
- SHE IS NOT READY TO SELL,

00:14.781 --> 00:16.549
SO WHAT THE [bleep]
AM I DOING HERE?

00:16.583 --> 00:18.551
- THIS IS WHAT I DREAM ABOUT!
24 UNITS.

00:18.585 --> 00:20.253
250 BOWERY.

00:20.286 --> 00:21.588
IT WOULD BE THE BIGGEST SUCCESS
OF MY CAREER.

00:21.621 --> 00:22.989
- WHAT ABOUT 250 BOWERY?

00:23.023 --> 00:25.191
- OH, GOD!
THAT'S FREDRIK'S NEW BUILDING.

00:25.225 --> 00:27.761
- WE'VE HAD OUR DIFFERENCES,
SO IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE

00:27.794 --> 00:29.496
HOW MUCH YOU WANT
THE BUILDING.

00:29.529 --> 00:30.497
HE'S GONNA HAVE TO EARN IT.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.165
- [falsetto]
WAAH!

00:32.198 --> 00:33.566
DO YOU HAVE PRICING,
FINALLY?

00:33.600 --> 00:34.968
- I DO.

00:35.001 --> 00:37.070
1,095,000.

00:37.103 --> 00:38.271
- YOU SAID YOU WERE
STARTING ONE-BEDROOMS

00:38.304 --> 00:39.539
AT, LIKE, 700,000.

00:39.572 --> 00:41.007
THAT MOTHER[bleep].

00:41.041 --> 00:42.809
THIS IS GONNA OUTPRICE
MY CLIENTS,

00:42.842 --> 00:44.811
AND HE MUST HAVE
KNOWN THIS ALL ALONG.

00:44.844 --> 00:48.014
[upbeat music]

00:48.048 --> 00:50.450
- MY MOTTO IS EXPANSION...

00:50.483 --> 00:53.219
ALWAYS IN ALL WAYS.

00:53.253 --> 00:54.688
- NEW YORK CITY,

00:54.721 --> 00:57.223
IT'S THE MOST EXCITING CITY
FOR REAL ESTATE,

00:57.257 --> 00:58.324
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

00:58.358 --> 01:00.827
- I'M THE CLOSER
AND A LISTING MACHINE.

01:00.860 --> 01:03.463
WHAT MAKES ME BETTER IS THAT
I WORK HARDER THAN ANYONE ELSE.

01:03.496 --> 01:04.864
- THIS IS THE SECOND TIME
YOU'VE DISRESPECTED ME, BRO.

01:04.898 --> 01:06.299
- HAVE I MET YOU BEFORE?

01:06.332 --> 01:08.702
- I WANTED THIS THING MORE THAN
ANYBODY ELSE, AND YOU KNEW IT!

01:08.735 --> 01:10.070
- IT'S OVER!

01:10.103 --> 01:14.541
* *

01:23.283 --> 01:24.384
[crowd chattering]

01:24.417 --> 01:25.919
- SO I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT PRICING.

01:25.952 --> 01:28.154
WE RAISED IT JUST A TAD.
A LIT--JUST A TINY BIT.

01:28.188 --> 01:30.156
- NO WAY.
- OKAY, 4-C...

01:30.190 --> 01:32.692
1,095,000.

01:32.726 --> 01:35.695
- YOU SAID YOU WERE STARTING
ONE-BEDROOMS AT, LIKE, 700,000.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.430
- WHAT CAN I DO?
900 PEOPLE ON THE WAITING LIST.

01:37.464 --> 01:39.265
I MEAN, THE MARKET...

01:39.299 --> 01:41.835
WHEN ZACH GAVE ME THE BUILDING,
I WORKED TIRELESSLY

01:41.868 --> 01:45.672
TO BUILD AN INTEREST LIST
OF OVER 900 PEOPLE.

01:45.705 --> 01:47.173
AND BECAUSE OF THAT
VERY HUGE INTEREST LIST,

01:47.207 --> 01:49.809
ZACH RAISED THE PRICES
BY A LOT.

01:49.843 --> 01:52.645
- I WANNA HIT $2,000
A SQUARE FOOT ON THIS BUILDING.

01:52.679 --> 01:55.715
- YOU'RE ASKING ME TO RAISE
THE PRICES BY 1/3, 33%.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.117
- I THINK YOU CAN DO IT.

01:57.150 --> 01:58.685
- NOW, YOU KNOW THAT'S NEVER,
EVER BEEN DONE? WHEW!

01:58.718 --> 02:00.487
- MY PEOPLE AREN'T PREPARED
TO PAY THAT MUCH.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.122
- YOU HAVE TO DO YOUR WORK,
YOUR JOB AS A BROKER,

02:02.155 --> 02:04.090
AND GET YOUR BUYERS UP
TO WHERE THE MARKET IS.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.592
LISTEN, THE BOWERY'S
THE HOTTEST.

02:05.625 --> 02:06.960
IT'S LIKE THE OLD MEATPACKING.
EVERYTHING'S MOVING--

02:07.060 --> 02:10.530
- THE BOWERY'S THE LOWER
EAST SIDE, [bleep]HOLE.

02:10.563 --> 02:11.898
I AM PISSED.

02:11.931 --> 02:14.067
I'VE BEEN WORKING HARD
TO TRY TO GET SOME BUYERS

02:14.067 --> 02:15.869
INTO FREDRIK'S NEW BUILDING,
250 BOWERY.

02:15.902 --> 02:17.337
AND BECAUSE FREDRIK'S
AN [bleep]HOLE,

02:17.370 --> 02:19.205
HE MADE ME DO THINGS
THAT ARE COMPLETELY ANNOYING

02:19.239 --> 02:20.707
AND JUST RIDICULOUS.

02:20.740 --> 02:22.142
[falsetto]
WAAH!

02:22.175 --> 02:23.743
- [laughs]
- BUT I DID THEM.

02:23.777 --> 02:25.879
AND AFTER ALL THAT,
FREDRIK JACKED UP THE PRICES

02:25.912 --> 02:27.614
AND NEVER GAVE ME
A HEADS UP.

02:27.647 --> 02:29.215
- RYAN, YOU'RE TAKING IT
WAY TOO PERSONAL.

02:29.249 --> 02:30.483
THIS IS NOT ABOUT
YOU AND ME.

02:30.517 --> 02:32.118
THIS IS ABOUT ME GETTING
THE HIGHEST PRICE FOR MY CLIENT.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.386
- YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

02:33.420 --> 02:34.921
THIS IS ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW
THAT I HAVE BUYERS

02:34.954 --> 02:36.856
THAT ARE WILLING TO PAY
A CERTAIN PRICE THAT YOU--

02:36.890 --> 02:37.991
- I HAVE 900 BUYERS!
- HEY, HEY.

02:38.091 --> 02:39.626
- I HAVE 900 FRICKIN' BUYERS.

02:39.659 --> 02:40.927
THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU.

02:40.960 --> 02:42.762
HE THINKS EVERYTHING
IS ABOUT HIM.

02:42.796 --> 02:45.932
HE THINKS--HE ACTUALLY BELIEVES
THAT I RAISED THE PRICES

02:45.965 --> 02:47.634
TO PISS HIM OFF.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.436
FIRST OF ALL, I DIDN'T
RAISE THE PRICES, ZACH DID.

02:49.469 --> 02:52.872
SECONDLY OF ALL,
EVERYONE HAS THE SAME PRICES.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.240
- WHEN DID YOU FIND OUT
THAT PRICING WAS RAISING?

02:54.274 --> 02:56.476
TODAY?
- WELL...

02:56.509 --> 02:57.510
- WHEN DID YOU
RAISE THE PRICING?

02:57.544 --> 02:58.578
- IT'S BEEN AN ONGOING--

02:58.611 --> 02:59.946
- WHEN DID YOU
RAISE THE PRICING?

03:00.046 --> 03:01.581
- A FEW DAYS AGO.

03:01.614 --> 03:02.882
HOW'S THAT?
- A FEW DAYS AGO.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.117
SO WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
A FEW DAYS AGO?

03:04.150 --> 03:05.385
UNTIL--YOU WAIT
TILL I COME HERE, WHEN--

03:05.418 --> 03:07.187
- I DIDN'T TELL ANYONE!
WHY ARE YOU SPECIAL?

03:07.220 --> 03:10.457
- YOU MADE ME GO ON A
[bleep]ING DOUBLE DATE WITH YOU.

03:10.490 --> 03:11.691
- THAT WAS NICE!

03:11.725 --> 03:13.727
WE HAD A GOOD TIME.
WE GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

03:15.462 --> 03:16.696
- YOU KNOW THAT'S GONNA
PRICE THEM OUT OF IT.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.131
- I'M DOING WHAT
THE DEVELOPERS WANT ME TO DO,

03:18.164 --> 03:21.167
WHICH IS TO GET
THE HIGHEST PRICE: $49 MILLION.

03:23.470 --> 03:25.105
- IF YOU KNEW THE PRICING
WAS GONNA JACK UP,

03:25.138 --> 03:26.506
THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU
SAY ANYTHING?

03:26.539 --> 03:28.074
WHY DID YOU MAKE ME GET ON
THE TOP OF THAT [bleep]ING BAR

03:28.074 --> 03:29.209
AND DO HIGH KICKS
IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE?

03:29.242 --> 03:32.145
- 'CAUSE IT WAS HILARIOUS!

03:32.178 --> 03:34.080
I MEAN, YOU GOT TO ADMIT,
IT FELT GOOD KICKING.

03:34.080 --> 03:36.883
- IT'S GONNA COME BACK
AND [bleep]ING HAUNT YOU.

03:36.916 --> 03:39.185
GO [bleep] YOURSELF.
- HAVE A GOOD EVENING.

03:39.219 --> 03:42.856
[crowd chattering]

03:42.889 --> 03:44.624
- FREDRIK RAISED THE PRICES.

03:44.657 --> 03:46.926
THAT'S FINE BY ME.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.962
BUT WHAT REALLY PISSES ME OFF

03:48.995 --> 03:51.865
IS THAT HE<i>KNEW</i>
HE WAS GONNA RAISE THE PRICES,

03:51.898 --> 03:54.434
AND HE TORTURED ME
THIS WHOLE TIME ANYWAY.

03:54.467 --> 03:56.369
GOD DAMN IT.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.171
- IT'S VERY DANGEROUS TO BE
A REAL ESTATE BROKER THESE DAYS.

03:58.204 --> 04:00.073
- [laughs]

04:11.117 --> 04:12.686
- EVEN THOUGH 50 LISPENARD
DID NOT GO THE WAY

04:12.719 --> 04:14.054
I WANTED IT TO GO--

04:14.054 --> 04:16.423
I WANTED THIS THING MORE
THAN ANY-[bleep]ING-BODY ELSE!

04:16.456 --> 04:18.358
- I DID NOT PLAY YOU.
- AND YOU [bleep]ING PLAY ME!

04:18.391 --> 04:19.826
WHAT I'VE LEARNED
FROM FREDRIK IS THE FACT

04:19.859 --> 04:22.062
THAT NEW DEVELOPMENTS
IS THE WAY TO GO.

04:22.062 --> 04:24.297
- YOU NEED TO GET YOURSELF
IN WITH THE DEVELOPERS.

04:24.330 --> 04:26.332
- SO SINCE THEN,
I HAVE BEEN REACHING OUT

04:26.366 --> 04:28.868
TO EVERY DEVELOPER IN THIS CITY,
BIG OR SMALL.

04:28.902 --> 04:31.371
DOESN'T MATTER.
I'M GOING AFTER EVERYBODY.

04:31.404 --> 04:33.473
- HEY, LUIS.
-<i>HOLA,</i>GOOD TO SEE YOU.

04:33.506 --> 04:34.841
- HEY, LUIS.
- SENORA, HOW ARE YOU?

04:34.874 --> 04:36.309
- HI, NICE TO SEE YOU.

04:36.343 --> 04:38.144
WE'RE EACH GONNA GET SOME COFFEE
AND WE'LL BE BACK.

04:38.178 --> 04:39.279
- SHOULD BE RIGHT BACK.
- YEAH, CERTAINLY.

04:39.312 --> 04:40.580
RACHEL AND REUBEN
ARE INVESTORS

04:40.613 --> 04:41.581
THAT ARE LOOKING FOR PROPERTY

04:41.614 --> 04:43.817
TO DEVELOP AND SELL
AS CONDOMINIUMS.

04:43.850 --> 04:45.085
ALL RIGHT.

04:45.085 --> 04:46.286
AND THIS IS WHERE I COME IN.

04:46.319 --> 04:47.754
TELL ME ABOUT, YOU KNOW,
WHERE DO YOU DEVELOP?

04:47.787 --> 04:48.855
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

04:48.888 --> 04:50.190
- RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED

04:50.223 --> 04:52.425
ON BUILDING SOMETHING
IN HARLEM.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.194
ONE OF THE BIG DRAWS
IS THE ARCHITECTURE

04:54.227 --> 04:55.428
AND HOW AMAZING IT IS.

04:55.462 --> 04:58.665
- HARLEM HAS HAD
A LONG AND RICH HISTORY.

04:58.698 --> 05:00.266
WHAT STARTED OUT AS FARMLAND

05:00.300 --> 05:04.637
BECAME AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN
COMMUNITY BACK IN THE 1920s.

05:04.671 --> 05:07.107
AND A LOT OF CELEBRATED PEOPLE
HAVE COME FROM HARLEM:

05:07.140 --> 05:10.377
MAYA ANGELOU,
LOUIS ARMSTRONG, TUPAC.

05:10.410 --> 05:13.079
AND RIGHT NOW, THE POPULATION
OF HARLEM IS GROWING A LOT,

05:13.113 --> 05:15.081
SO THERE IS MORE NEED
FOR AMAZING CONDOMINIUMS...

05:15.115 --> 05:16.149
- CORRECT.
- TO BE BUILT.

05:16.182 --> 05:18.151
- YES, ABSOLUTELY.

05:18.184 --> 05:19.853
- SO WHAT IS THE BUDGET?
HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT TO SPEND?

05:19.886 --> 05:22.689
- OUR BUDGET IS BETWEEN,
YOU KNOW--IS AROUND 850,000.

05:22.722 --> 05:24.724
- OUR IDEAL PROPERTY
IS A 20-FOOTER.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.359
20 FEET WIDE.
- OKAY.

05:26.393 --> 05:27.961
- I'M SPECIFICALLY LOOKING
WEST OF MADISON,

05:28.061 --> 05:30.830
SOUTH OF 125TH.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.298
- OKAY.

05:32.332 --> 05:35.301
- OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM RIGHT NOW
IS WE CAN'T FIND PROPERTIES.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.837
- 6,000 SQUARE FEET,
BUILDABLE,

05:37.871 --> 05:40.340
A BEAUTIFUL ARCHITECTURE,
AND NUMBERS THAT MAKE SENSE.

05:40.373 --> 05:43.076
MOST LIKELY, YOU WOULDN'T
FIND IT UNDER--SOUTH OF 125TH

05:43.076 --> 05:45.311
BECAUSE THE INVENTORY
IS SO LOW.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.312
LIKE EVERY OTHER DEVELOPER,

05:46.346 --> 05:47.981
RACHEL AND REUBEN
WANT TO DEVELOP

05:48.081 --> 05:50.450
IN AREAS WHERE BUYERS
ARE INTERESTED IN BUYING.

05:50.483 --> 05:52.952
NOW, GOING NORTH
OF 125TH STREET,

05:52.986 --> 05:57.290
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT
TO ATTRACT POTENTIAL BUYERS.

05:57.323 --> 06:01.127
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,
BELOW $1 MILLION DOES NOT EXIST.

06:01.161 --> 06:03.430
- YOU LOOK LIKE A GUY
THAT'S UP FOR A CHALLENGE,

06:03.463 --> 06:04.631
SO LET'S GO.

06:04.664 --> 06:07.500
- THIS IS ALREADY GREAT.<i>SALUD.</i>
- CHEERS.

06:17.711 --> 06:18.945
- [puffs]

06:19.045 --> 06:21.815
AFTER FREDRIK'S RIDICULOUS
PRICE INCREASE,

06:21.848 --> 06:24.184
I'VE BEEN CALLING MY CLIENTS
ALL MORNING.

06:24.217 --> 06:27.053
SO FAR, THEY'VE ALL DECIDED
TO LOOK ELSEWHERE.

06:27.053 --> 06:28.254
[line ringing]

06:28.288 --> 06:30.290
BUT I STILL HAVEN'T
GOTTEN AHOLD OF JOHN,

06:30.323 --> 06:32.492
MY CLIENT WHO SEEMED
THE MOST INTERESTED.

06:32.525 --> 06:35.729
- PLEASE LEAVE YOUR MESSAGE.
[beep]

06:35.762 --> 06:37.063
- HEY, JOHN, IT'S RYAN.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.264
I WENT TO THE LAUNCH PARTY,

06:38.298 --> 06:41.234
UM, AND IT WAS
A TOTAL [bleep]ING DISASTER.

06:41.267 --> 06:44.170
THEY RAISED PRICING 30%.

06:44.204 --> 06:46.606
SO, UH, I REALLY THINK

06:46.639 --> 06:48.508
THAT WE NEED TO START
LOOKING AT OTHER OPTIONS.

06:48.541 --> 06:50.210
I'M AVAILABLE.
CALL ME BACK ON MY CELL

06:50.243 --> 06:52.245
IF YOU WANT TO DISCUSS.
BYE.

06:52.278 --> 06:53.880
I'LL KEEP FOLLOWING UP
WITH JOHN,

06:53.913 --> 06:56.349
BUT I ALSO NEED TO START WORKING
ON MY NEXT LISTING.

06:56.383 --> 06:57.684
[whispering]
OH, MY GOD.

06:57.717 --> 07:01.388
I NEED A VACATION.

07:07.594 --> 07:11.231
- SAMMY, ARE YOU READY
FOR A LONG DAY IN THE CAR?

07:11.264 --> 07:13.533
- YEP.
- LET'S GO TO 3RD AVENUE.

07:13.566 --> 07:14.634
- YOU GOT IT.

07:14.668 --> 07:15.669
- SINCE MY PARTY TWO DAYS AGO,

07:15.702 --> 07:18.271
250 BOWERY IS BLOWING UP.

07:18.304 --> 07:21.641
A FEW BROKERS HAVEN'T
UNDERSTOOD THE PRICE INCREASE...

07:21.675 --> 07:23.643
- YOU'RE [bleep]ING ME
AND MY BUYERS.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.345
- BUT THERE ARE A LOT
OF BROKERS

07:25.378 --> 07:27.080
WHO UNDERSTAND THE VALUE
OF THIS BUILDING.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.682
I'VE NEVER REALLY DONE IT
THIS WAY BEFORE,

07:28.715 --> 07:30.050
BUT I THINK IT'S GONNA BE
A LOT OF FUN.

07:30.083 --> 07:33.420
AND FOR THEM, I'M DELIVERING
MY FIRST DEAL SHEETS.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.689
THEY'RE NOT OFFERS,
THEY'RE REAL DONE DEALS.

07:35.722 --> 07:36.790
HI!

07:36.823 --> 07:38.291
- HI, FREDRIK.
- HI, BEAUTIFUL.

07:38.324 --> 07:40.060
both: MWAH!

07:40.060 --> 07:41.094
- SO TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.395
- OKAY, LET'S TAKE
A LITTLE RIDE,

07:42.429 --> 07:45.298
BECAUSE YOU GUYS, YOU DID
TWO DEALS: 4-E AND 5-E.

07:45.331 --> 07:46.299
- THAT'S RIGHT.

07:46.332 --> 07:48.501
- FULL ASK, ALL CASH.

07:48.535 --> 07:50.136
$50,000 TO YOU,
$50,000 TO ME.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.238
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- CONGRATS.

07:52.272 --> 07:53.506
YOU WORKED REALLY HARD
ON THIS.

07:53.540 --> 07:55.642
- I'M SO HAPPY FOR US,
AND THANKS FOR THE RIDE.

07:55.675 --> 07:57.077
- YES,
YOU'VE BEEN A PLEASURE.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.478
- TAKE CARE. HAVE A GOOD DAY.
- BYE, SEE YOU LATER.

07:58.511 --> 08:01.281
MORE DEALS!

08:01.314 --> 08:02.782
THIS IS EXCITING.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.551
WHEN DOES A BROKER
GET THE CHANCE

08:04.584 --> 08:07.020
TO DO THIS MANY DEALS
IN ONE DAY?

08:07.020 --> 08:08.221
OKAY, WE'RE HERE.

08:08.254 --> 08:09.589
"COME OUT.

08:09.622 --> 08:11.558
BIG COMMISSION
WAITING FOR YOU."

08:11.591 --> 08:12.859
FIRST OF ALL, CONGRATS.
- THANK YOU.

08:12.892 --> 08:13.860
I'M GLAD WE GOT IT DONE.

08:13.893 --> 08:15.428
- THIS IS 3-E.

08:15.462 --> 08:18.131
$46,250 COMMISSION.

08:18.164 --> 08:21.267
3-A. OOH!
- ALL RIGHT.

08:21.301 --> 08:22.602
- CONGRATS.
LET'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT.

08:22.635 --> 08:23.670
I HAVE A FEW MORE
TO HAND OUT.

08:23.703 --> 08:25.038
IT'S LIKE CHRISTMAS.

08:25.038 --> 08:27.040
I'M THE SWEDISH SANTA CLAUS.
- [laughs]

08:27.073 --> 08:30.610
- WHAT PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND,
A DEAL SHEET IS GOLD.

08:30.643 --> 08:31.845
OH, THERE SHE IS.

08:31.878 --> 08:33.179
HI!

08:33.213 --> 08:35.448
WELCOME INTO
THE "250 BOWERY MOBILE."

08:35.482 --> 08:36.516
OH, MY GOD!
[laughs]

08:36.549 --> 08:38.918
THERE'S DEAL SHEETS
EVERYWHERE.

08:38.952 --> 08:41.354
EACH ONE OF THESE PAPERS
ARE WORTH A LOT OF MONEY FOR ME.

08:41.388 --> 08:44.391
COMMISSION IS 81,250.

08:44.424 --> 08:46.626
AND THAT DEAL SHEET'S WORTH GOLD
FOR THE OTHER BROKER AS WELL.

08:46.659 --> 08:48.161
[whooshes]
THERE YOU ARE.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.262
[falsetto]
DEAL SHEET!

08:49.295 --> 08:52.298
FULL ASK.
2,200,000.

08:52.332 --> 08:54.100
MWAH!
- THANK YOU, MY DEAR.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.201
- GET IT SIGNED QUICKLY.
- WILL DO SO.

08:55.235 --> 08:58.204
$141,000 COMMISSION.

08:58.238 --> 08:59.806
- THIS IS AMAZING!
- IT'S THE LARGEST PENTHOUSE.

08:59.839 --> 09:02.575
EIGHT DEALS,
EIGHT COMMISSIONS.

09:02.609 --> 09:03.677
OKAY, SAMMY,
THIS IS A GOOD ONE.

09:03.710 --> 09:07.313
2,175,000.

09:07.347 --> 09:09.649
I'M OFFICIALLY 1/3 SOLD OUT
OF 250 BOWERY

09:09.683 --> 09:11.151
ON THE FIRST DAY
OF SELLING.

09:11.184 --> 09:13.186
CHING! CHING!

09:14.354 --> 09:15.422
- NOW LET'S JUST GET OUT
FOR ONE SECOND.

09:15.455 --> 09:18.458
- LUIS, IT'S REALLY UGLY.
NEXT!

09:19.693 --> 09:21.361
- WELL, THE PRICES
ARE WHAT THEY ARE.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.762
I THOUGHT THE BUILDING
WAS GONNA SELL OUT...

09:22.796 --> 09:24.798
[snaps fingers]
LIKE THAT.

09:26.099 --> 09:28.601
THESE PEOPLE ARE LIVING
IN THE '90s!

09:35.575 --> 09:40.747
- ALL RIGHT, SO WE'RE GOING NOW
TO 114 123RD STREET.

09:40.780 --> 09:43.583
HARLEM HAS BEEN EXTREMELY HOT
FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW,

09:43.616 --> 09:47.454
AND DEVELOPERS
ARE REVITALIZING THE ENTIRE AREA

09:47.487 --> 09:50.056
AND BRINGING IT BACK
TO ITS HISTORIC ESSENCE.

09:50.056 --> 09:51.458
BUT I HAVE DONE
A LOT OF RESEARCH,

09:51.491 --> 09:55.195
AND THERE IS ACTUALLY NOTHING
SOUTH OF 125TH STREET

09:55.228 --> 09:56.963
THAT'S 20 FEET WIDE,
6,000 SQUARE-FOOT, BUILDABLE,

09:57.063 --> 09:58.932
FOR LESS THAN
A MILLION DOLLARS.

09:58.965 --> 10:01.067
SO I HAVE CONVINCED THEM
TO LOOK AT PROPERTIES

10:01.101 --> 10:02.435
THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER

10:02.469 --> 10:03.937
THAN WHAT THEY ORIGINALLY
PLANNED TO SPEND.

10:03.970 --> 10:05.839
HAN, LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
TO RACHEL AND REUBEN.

10:05.872 --> 10:07.307
- HI. HOW ARE YOU?
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

10:07.340 --> 10:08.775
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

10:08.808 --> 10:10.710
- SO THIS IS THE PROPERTY
THAT I TALKED TO YOU ABOUT.

10:10.744 --> 10:13.413
- YEAH, IT'S, LIKE,
17 FEET BY 100.

10:16.583 --> 10:19.419
BUT THERE IS
STRUCTURAL ISSUES INSIDE.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.487
- WHAT KIND OF ISSUES?

10:20.520 --> 10:22.489
- WE NEED TO MAKE SURE
IT IS STABLE.

10:22.522 --> 10:25.258
- THE STRUCTURAL ISSUE
SCARES ME A LITTLE.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.093
WE RECENTLY
LOOKED AT A BUILDING

10:27.127 --> 10:30.597
AND OUR ENGINEER SAID,
"NOT SURE ABOUT THE FOUNDATION."

10:30.630 --> 10:32.365
THE NEXT WEEK,
THE BUILDING COLLAPSED, SO...

10:32.399 --> 10:33.500
- RIGHT

10:33.533 --> 10:34.834
- WE MAY NOT BE
THE PEOPLE FOR IT,

10:34.868 --> 10:35.969
BUT IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

10:36.002 --> 10:37.937
- SO YOU SAID--
SO YOU HAVE SOMETHING ELSE?

10:37.971 --> 10:40.273
- YEAH, 136 WEST 123RD.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.608
IT'S IN CONSTRUCTION NOW.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.143
both: CAN WE GO SEE IT NOW?
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

10:43.176 --> 10:44.511
LET'S DO IT.
[overlapping agreements]

10:44.544 --> 10:47.113
SO THIS IS 136.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.682
YOU CAN SEE THE BACK.

10:48.715 --> 10:51.418
- COME ON, LET'S GO.

10:51.451 --> 10:52.686
- ALL RIGHT.
- SO THIS IS THE GROUND LEVEL.

10:52.719 --> 10:54.821
- WHY IS IT SO CLOSED UP?

10:54.854 --> 10:57.390
- AND WHAT IS THIS?
- THAT'S THE LIVING AREA.

10:57.424 --> 10:59.693
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE MASTER
IN THE BACK.

10:59.726 --> 11:02.195
- THAT'S THE MASTER?
- YES.

11:02.228 --> 11:04.364
- THERE'S, LIKE, NO SPACE.
- RIGHT.

11:04.397 --> 11:07.667
- YEAH, I THINK I GOT THE POINT.
DOESN'T WORK FOR ME.

11:14.307 --> 11:16.076
- ALL RIGHT, JOE,
WE'RE GONNA GO TO 49TH,

11:16.076 --> 11:17.744
BETWEEN 2ND AND 3RD.

11:17.777 --> 11:20.080
THE PENTHOUSE
AT 250 EAST 49TH,

11:20.080 --> 11:21.715
IS LOCATED IN TURTLE BAY,

11:21.748 --> 11:24.384
WHICH IS A PART
OF MIDTOWN EAST,

11:24.417 --> 11:27.487
AND MY BOSS EDDIE
HAS ASKED ME TO CO-LIST

11:27.520 --> 11:30.090
WITH ANOTHER BROKER
WHO'S RELATIVELY INEXPERIENCED

11:30.090 --> 11:31.524
AND NEW TO THE BUSINESS.

11:31.558 --> 11:32.792
- HELLO.
- HEY.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.361
- THANK YOU FOR MEETING ME.

11:34.394 --> 11:35.628
- I REALLY DON'T LIKE
CO-LISTING ANYTHING.

11:35.662 --> 11:36.730
- READY?
- IS SHE UPSTAIRS?

11:36.763 --> 11:38.198
- SHE IS.
- LET'S DO IT.

11:38.231 --> 11:39.799
BUT IN THIS CASE,
JILL HAS PROMISED

11:39.833 --> 11:41.001
TO DO ALL OF THE WORK

11:41.101 --> 11:43.370
IF I JUST HELP HER
GET THE LISTING.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.905
THIS IS GONNA BE
A PIECE OF CAKE.

11:45.939 --> 11:46.940
both: HELLO.
- HEY.

11:46.973 --> 11:48.108
- HOW ARE YOU?

11:48.108 --> 11:49.376
- ELLA?
- JILL, RYAN? YES.

11:49.409 --> 11:50.377
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

11:50.410 --> 11:51.745
WHOA.

11:51.778 --> 11:54.948
[upbeat music]

11:54.981 --> 12:03.056
* *

12:14.300 --> 12:16.703
IT'S A HUGE MASTER SUITE.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.104
YOU HAVE THE BED HERE.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.572
ALSO PART OF THE OFFICE.

12:19.606 --> 12:21.107
DOES THAT MAKE IT
TOUGH TO SHOW?

12:21.141 --> 12:24.144
- YES, ABSOLUTELY.

12:25.145 --> 12:27.180
- SO EXPLAIN TO US

12:27.213 --> 12:29.249
WHAT THE STATUS
OF THE APARTMENT IS RIGHT NOW.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.317
- WE HAD IT
ON THE MARKET OFFICIALLY

12:31.351 --> 12:32.519
FOR SIX MONTHS,

12:32.552 --> 12:36.256
AND WE DIDN'T ATTRACT
A LOT OF CLIENTS.

12:36.289 --> 12:37.457
- SURE.

12:37.490 --> 12:39.626
- AND WE WOULD LIKE
SOME NEW, FRESH IDEAS.

12:39.659 --> 12:41.928
- OKAY.
- UM...

12:41.961 --> 12:45.999
- WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER?

12:46.099 --> 12:49.102
- CLOSE TO 17 MILLION.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.304
IS THAT A NUMBER
YOU CAN WORK WITH?

12:51.338 --> 12:54.107
- IDEALLY,
RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW,

12:54.107 --> 12:55.475
IF YOU KEPT IT AROUND

12:55.508 --> 12:57.577
THE $17-MILLION,
$18-MILLION FIGURE,

12:57.610 --> 12:58.945
THERE'S TOO MUCH OUT THERE.

12:58.978 --> 13:01.681
IF WE KEEP IT UNDER 15--

13:01.715 --> 13:03.183
SO THAT'S, LIKE,
AN AGGREGATE OF A LITTLE BIT

13:03.216 --> 13:05.352
OF UNDER $3,000 A SQUARE FOOT--
- MM-HMM.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.120
- WE REALLY,
REALLY STAND OUT.

13:07.153 --> 13:08.788
SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE PEOPLE
WHO ARE GONNA SAY,

13:08.822 --> 13:10.423
"WELL, FOR 15 MILLION,
I CAN GET A TWO-BEDROOM

13:10.457 --> 13:12.125
"IN COLUMBUS CIRCLE,

13:12.158 --> 13:14.060
"OR I CAN GET A FIVE-BEDROOM

13:14.060 --> 13:16.596
"WITH 6,000 SQUARE FEET
OF SPACE,

13:16.629 --> 13:20.533
YOU KNOW,
ON 49TH STREET."

13:22.902 --> 13:25.905
- MY HUSBAND HAD MARKETED IT
VERY PROFESSIONALLY,

13:25.939 --> 13:29.609
AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW,
WHAT WOULD YOU DO DIFFERENT?

13:29.642 --> 13:30.944
- I THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT
TO SELL THE APARTMENT

13:30.977 --> 13:32.379
THE WAY
IT'S CURRENTLY STAGED.

13:32.412 --> 13:34.481
- RIGHT.
- IT FEELS A LITTLE LIKE 1991.

13:34.514 --> 13:36.449
IT'S KIND OF<i>AUSTIN POWERS</i>
A LITTLE BIT.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.551
AND THEN UPSTAIRS
IS VERY, VERY BEAUTIFUL,

13:38.585 --> 13:40.387
AND THAT'S GOING TO BE ONE
OF THE HIGHLIGHTS

13:40.420 --> 13:41.521
OF SELLING THIS.

13:41.554 --> 13:42.722
BUT IT'S JUST VERY CONFUSING

13:42.756 --> 13:44.557
WHEN THERE'S DESKS
AND PAPERS AND PRINTERS

13:44.591 --> 13:45.859
FILLING UP A CLOSET.

13:45.892 --> 13:46.893
- I ALREADY HAVE SOMEBODY
IN MIND

13:46.926 --> 13:48.094
THAT I'D LIKE TO WORK WITH,

13:48.094 --> 13:51.598
A TOP INTERIOR DESIGNER
WHO WILL DO EVERYTHING,

13:51.631 --> 13:55.301
FROM DRESSING FIVE BEDROOMS
TO PUTTING IN ARTWORK.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.437
YOU KNOW, REALLY MAKE IT
SO IT'S ALIVE.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.639
- SO IT WILL BE ALL COVERED
BY YOUR COMPANY?

13:59.673 --> 14:02.042
- WELL, WE CAN--
- ABSOLUTELY.

14:02.075 --> 14:04.744
ALL AT OUR COST.

14:04.778 --> 14:06.713
- VERY GOOD, SOUNDS GOOD.

14:06.746 --> 14:08.314
I THINK WE CAN WORK TOGETHER.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.784
- GREAT, LOOKING FORWARD.
- WOW.

14:10.817 --> 14:13.620
DID SHE REALLY
JUST OFFER OUR SERVICES

14:13.653 --> 14:15.055
TO COVER ALL OF THE STAGING?

14:15.055 --> 14:17.924
THAT'S LIKE--
THAT'S, LIKE, 30 OR 40 GRAND.

14:17.957 --> 14:19.159
IS THIS WOMAN NUTS?

14:19.192 --> 14:20.694
IF YOU JUST WANNA SIGN
RIGHT THERE.

14:20.727 --> 14:21.928
- OKAY.

14:21.961 --> 14:23.329
- I LIKE IT.
YOU DIDN'T EVEN REALLY READ IT.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.531
- I TRUST YOU.

14:24.564 --> 14:26.700
YOU ARE INVESTING MONEY
IN MY SPACE.

14:26.733 --> 14:30.370
- I AM. I THINK WE'RE
SPENDING MONEY ALREADY.

14:37.143 --> 14:40.213
- EMILY. IT'S RICHARD FARB
WITH DOUGLAS ELLIMAN.

14:40.246 --> 14:41.915
- HEY, JOHN. FRED.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

14:41.948 --> 14:45.085
- HI, FREDRIK EKLUND HERE
AT DOUGLAS ELLIMAN.

14:45.085 --> 14:46.186
I'M GOOD.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.955
YOU LOOKED AT PENTHOUSE B
AT 250 BOWERY.

14:48.988 --> 14:50.990
DO YOU GUYS
HAVE ANY INTEREST?

14:52.792 --> 14:54.961
YEAH, BUT WITH 900 PEOPLE
ON A WAITING LIST,

14:54.994 --> 14:56.396
WHY WOULDN'T WE RAISE IT?

14:56.429 --> 15:00.233
4 MILLION IS STILL A GREAT PRICE
FOR THIS NEIGHBORHOOD, NO?

15:04.204 --> 15:06.172
OKAY,
I RESPECT YOUR DECISION

15:06.206 --> 15:07.574
AND I APPRECIATE
THE FEEDBACK.

15:07.607 --> 15:11.878
UM...
BIG KISS, GOOD-BYE.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.414
OH, MY GOD.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.049
WELL, THE PRICES
ARE WHAT THEY ARE,

15:16.049 --> 15:17.717
AND I HAVE A LONG LIST HERE
OF PEOPLE,

15:17.751 --> 15:18.785
SO I--I'LL CALL
THE NEXT ONE.

15:18.818 --> 15:20.553
[flutters lips]

15:20.587 --> 15:22.088
NO, WE'RE NOT NEGOTIABLE.
NOT AT ALL.

15:22.122 --> 15:23.590
AND WHY IS THAT?

15:23.623 --> 15:25.225
OH, MY GOD.
IS IT WARM IN HERE?

15:25.258 --> 15:26.860
OH, MY GOD.

15:26.893 --> 15:30.230
THESE PEOPLE
ARE LIVING IN THE '90s!

15:30.263 --> 15:33.199
AFTER I SOLD
THE FIRST EIGHT UNITS,

15:33.233 --> 15:34.768
I THOUGHT THE BUILDING
WAS GONNA SELL OUT...

15:34.801 --> 15:35.869
[snaps fingers]
LIKE THAT.

15:35.902 --> 15:38.071
CAN SOMEBODY PLEASE
GIVE ME GOOD NEWS?

15:38.071 --> 15:39.406
AND HERE I AM
GETTING A LOT OF PUSH-BACK

15:39.439 --> 15:40.640
BECAUSE OF THE PRICING.

15:40.674 --> 15:42.742
- WELL, I JUST TALKED
TO JACQUELINE FROM 4-D,

15:42.776 --> 15:44.611
AND SHE'S--
SHE'S FLIPPING OUT.

15:44.644 --> 15:47.113
I MEAN, IT'S, LIKE,
A $800 INCREASE, YOU KNOW,

15:47.147 --> 15:48.648
PER SQUARE FOOT.

15:48.682 --> 15:51.117
- RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW, I'M
HAVING THE SAME ISSUE ON 3-D.

15:51.151 --> 15:53.153
- IT IS SO INCREDIBLY
FRUSTRATING.

15:53.186 --> 15:55.088
I WORKED SO HARD
TO BUILD THAT LIST

15:55.088 --> 15:56.523
UP TO 900 PEOPLE.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.625
THE LIST IS COMING
DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN,

15:58.658 --> 16:01.027
AND NOW I'M FAR
FROM BEING SOLD OUT.

16:01.027 --> 16:02.529
- WELL, AGAIN, YOU KNOW,
WHAT I'M GETTING

16:02.562 --> 16:04.030
FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE
IS THEY FEEL LIKE

16:04.030 --> 16:05.865
IT WAS CHANGED MIDSTREAM.

16:05.899 --> 16:07.233
- IT WASN'T--
NOTHING WAS CHANGED.

16:07.267 --> 16:08.234
THE OFFERING PLAN
WASN'T APPROVED.

16:08.268 --> 16:09.235
WE WERE TESTING THE MARKET.

16:09.269 --> 16:10.403
WE WERE GIVING RANGES.

16:10.437 --> 16:12.105
- WELL, I THINK MAYBE
WHAT WE SHOULD DO

16:12.138 --> 16:13.640
IS MAYBE YOU CAN GET
WITH THE DEVELOPER--

16:13.673 --> 16:15.575
- DEVELOPER?
MY CLIENT? WHY?

16:15.608 --> 16:17.110
- WOULD HE BE WILLING TO,
LIKE, THROW IN TRANSFER TAX

16:17.143 --> 16:18.945
ON THE DEALS?
- NO, NO, I'M NOT NEGOTIATING.

16:19.045 --> 16:20.447
- ALL RIGHT, WELL--
- I HAVE AN IDEA.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.781
AND A BETTER IDEA THAN THAT.

16:21.815 --> 16:26.052
WHY DON'T WE JUST NOT SLEEP
UNTIL THIS IS DONE?

16:26.086 --> 16:27.487
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO?

16:27.520 --> 16:28.922
NO MORE PHONE CALLS.

16:28.955 --> 16:30.156
I'M GONNA CHANGE STRATEGY
RIGHT NOW.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.258
I'M GONNA GO--
GIVE IT TO ME.

16:32.292 --> 16:34.627
I'M GONNA GO.
I'M GONNA GO MEET THESE PEOPLE.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.496
NO MORE PHONE CALLS.
IT'S NOT WORKING, OBVIOUSLY.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.865
BEFORE MY INTEREST LIST
DWINDLES DOWN TO ZERO,

16:38.898 --> 16:41.134
I NEED TO GET OUT THERE
AND GIVE BROKERS AND BUYERS,

16:41.167 --> 16:42.969
LIKE, SOME ONE-ON-ONE
ATTENTION,

16:43.069 --> 16:45.372
AND CONVINCE THEM
THAT THIS IS A GREAT BUY.

16:45.405 --> 16:48.074
ATTACK IS BEST DEFENSE.

16:51.978 --> 16:54.914
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
SO THIS ONE TO THE RIGHT...

16:54.948 --> 16:56.116
- WHICH ONE?

16:56.149 --> 16:58.685
- THIS ONE WITH THE--
WITH THE METAL DOOR.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.253
- THIS ONE?
- YEP.

17:00.286 --> 17:02.322
- LUIS, I'M GONNA STAY
IN THE CAR.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.890
IT'S--IT'S REALLY UGLY.

17:03.923 --> 17:05.859
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

17:05.892 --> 17:07.293
THE NUMBERS ARE GREAT.

17:07.327 --> 17:08.461
- LUIS, I HAVE TO FEEL IT.

17:08.495 --> 17:10.096
I'M NOT FEELING IT.
IT'S UGLY.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.297
YOU SAID YOU'RE
GONNA SHOW US FANTASTIC.

17:11.331 --> 17:12.599
THIS IS NOT FANTASTIC.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.367
- SHE THINKS IT'S
A PAIR OF SHOES.

17:14.401 --> 17:16.036
- WELL...

17:16.036 --> 17:18.271
- NEXT!
- [laughs]

17:18.304 --> 17:20.306
- REUBEN AND RACHEL
ARE A VERY INTERESTING COUPLE.

17:20.340 --> 17:21.441
ALL RIGHT.

17:21.474 --> 17:23.109
REUBEN IS KIND OF, LIKE,
THE NUMBERS GUY.

17:23.143 --> 17:24.244
HE'S VERY PRACTICAL.

17:24.277 --> 17:26.279
AND RACHEL, SHE'S VERY PICKY.

17:26.312 --> 17:27.447
SHE'S VERY PARTICULAR

17:27.480 --> 17:30.050
ABOUT HOW BEAUTIFUL
A STRUCTURE ACTUALLY IS.

17:30.083 --> 17:31.651
SO I'M NOT JUST PLEASING ONE.

17:31.685 --> 17:33.053
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

17:33.053 --> 17:35.422
EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE SEEN TODAY
IS SOUTH OF 125TH.

17:35.455 --> 17:38.291
WE NEED TO GO NORTH
OF 125TH STREET

17:38.324 --> 17:39.826
TO FIND
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

17:39.859 --> 17:41.127
AND LISTEN,
IT'S JUST ANOTHER--

17:41.161 --> 17:43.163
I KNOW IT'S A STREET
THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT

17:43.196 --> 17:44.264
FROM ANY OTHER STREET,

17:44.297 --> 17:45.932
BUT THINK ABOUT IT
IN FIVE YEARS.

17:45.965 --> 17:48.068
128 IS GONNA BE
LIKE 110TH STREET.

17:48.101 --> 17:49.736
HAVE A LITTLE BIT
OF FAITH IN ME,

17:49.769 --> 17:51.438
AND BELIEVE THAT I AM--
THIS IS ONLY OUR FIRST MEETING.

17:51.471 --> 17:52.672
- WE WILL, AND WE'RE HAPPY

17:52.706 --> 17:53.940
TO THINK OUT OF THE BOX
A LITTLE,

17:53.973 --> 17:55.742
BUT AS LONG
AS IT'S A LITTLE.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.210
- 130TH?

17:57.243 --> 17:59.546
- 128TH.

17:59.579 --> 18:00.547
- 129TH.

18:00.580 --> 18:01.815
- 128TH.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.016
- 128TH AND 1/2.
- NOPE.

18:03.049 --> 18:04.718
- 128TH IT IS.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.753
SHE'S A NEGOTIATOR.
I LOVE IT.

18:06.786 --> 18:09.389
I WILL SHOW YOU
SOMETHING FANTASTIC.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.557
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:10.590 --> 18:12.092
WE'RE HAVING A LOT OF ISSUES.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.693
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"A LOT OF ISSUES"?

18:13.727 --> 18:16.463
- OUR INTERIOR DESIGNER
AND THE ARTIST PULLED OUT.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.431
- GET THE [bleep] OUT OF HERE.
THIS IS NOT REAL.

18:18.465 --> 18:19.899
- IT'S REAL.

18:27.073 --> 18:31.444
- IN A CO-LIST SITUATION,
YOU DIVVY UP DUTIES.

18:31.478 --> 18:35.215
THE OPEN HOUSE IS IN TWO DAYS,
SO JILL SAID

18:35.248 --> 18:36.883
SHE WANTED TO TAKE CARE
OF ALL THE STAGING.

18:36.916 --> 18:38.551
SHE SEEMS LIKE
SHE HAS SOME STYLE,

18:38.585 --> 18:39.853
AND I'M EXCITED TO SEE
HOW AWESOME

18:39.886 --> 18:41.755
THE STAGING
MAKES THE PLACE LOOK.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.289
[sighs]

18:43.323 --> 18:46.326
WHOA.

18:48.395 --> 18:50.797
THIS LOOKS THE SAME.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.332
WHAT'S GOING ON?
ALL THE STUFF IS STILL IN HERE.

18:52.365 --> 18:53.767
- WE'RE HAVING
A LOT OF ISSUES.

18:53.800 --> 18:54.768
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"A LOT OF ISSUES"?

18:54.801 --> 18:58.905
- OUR INTERIOR DESIGNER...
WALKED.

18:58.938 --> 19:02.175
- THIS IS A-A NIGHTMARE.
- I HAVE SOME MORE BAD NEWS.

19:02.208 --> 19:06.079
THE ARTIST WHO AGREED
TO USE THE ART,

19:06.112 --> 19:07.914
COMMISSION THE ART,
THROUGH THIS WHOLE SPACE...

19:08.014 --> 19:08.915
- RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT...
- ON THIS FLOOR.

19:09.015 --> 19:10.216
HE'S ALSO PULLED OUT.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.018
- GET THE [bleep] OUT OF HERE.
- YEAH.

19:12.018 --> 19:14.854
- THIS IS NOT REAL.
- IT'S REAL.

19:14.888 --> 19:17.257
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- THINGS HAPPEN,

19:17.290 --> 19:18.258
YOU KNOW,
IN A STAGING PROCESS

19:18.291 --> 19:19.492
WITH A LOT OF PERSONALITIES,

19:19.526 --> 19:20.894
A LOT OF PEOPLE
WE'RE DEALING WITH...

19:20.927 --> 19:22.595
- THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

19:22.629 --> 19:26.032
APPARENTLY, SHE DIDN'T
SIGN CONTRACTS WITH ANYBODY,

19:26.032 --> 19:27.033
AND NOW THINGS
ARE FALLING APART.

19:27.033 --> 19:28.468
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.036
JUST LET ME THINK, LET ME THINK,
LET ME THINK, LET ME THINK.

19:30.036 --> 19:31.071
- SO, UM...

19:31.104 --> 19:32.405
- [clears throat]

19:32.439 --> 19:35.875
OKAY, WHERE'S THE SUPER?

19:35.909 --> 19:38.311
- OKAY, NO BRA.

19:38.345 --> 19:39.346
- WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THE BRA?

19:39.379 --> 19:40.380
- OH, JUST HAVING A BRA ISSUE.

19:40.413 --> 19:41.848
- YOU'RE HAVING
A BRA ISSUE?

19:41.881 --> 19:43.483
- YEAH,
IT'S PLAYING PEEKABOO.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.051
- YOUR--YOUR BOOBS
ARE PLAYING PEEKABOO?

19:45.051 --> 19:46.486
- MY BRA.
I DON'T MIND THE BOOBS.

19:46.519 --> 19:49.055
I MIND THE BRA.
- AH, WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE.

19:49.055 --> 19:52.158
LET'S FOCUS ON THE MOVE.

19:52.192 --> 19:55.962
THIS IS A TOTAL [bleep] SHOW,
AND MY NAME IS ATTACHED TO IT.

19:56.062 --> 19:58.331
AND NOW,
GUESS WHO GETS TO DO THIS?

19:58.365 --> 20:00.834
GUESS WHO GETS TO DO EVERYTHING,
AS USUAL? ME.

20:00.867 --> 20:01.901
ALL WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW
IS SPENDING MONEY.

20:01.935 --> 20:03.069
- THAT'S RIGHT.

20:03.103 --> 20:04.337
- SO DO YOU WANT
TO GRAB THE SUPER?

20:04.371 --> 20:05.505
AND I WILL FIGURE OUT
WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.007
- YES.
BE RIGHT BACK.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.909
- SO NOW, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO CALL IN A FEW FAVORS.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.982
- LUIS.
- JILL.

20:16.016 --> 20:17.317
RACHEL AND REUBEN
DID NOT LIKE

20:17.350 --> 20:19.052
ANYTHING THAT I SHOWED 'EM
WITHIN THEIR CRITERIA.

20:19.085 --> 20:22.622
SO I HAVE CALLED
EVERYBODY I KNOW.

20:22.655 --> 20:24.457
RYAN.

20:24.491 --> 20:25.759
LUIS ORTIZ.
HOW ARE YOU?

20:25.792 --> 20:27.060
AND EVERYBODY I DON'T KNOW.

20:27.093 --> 20:29.396
DO YOU KNOW OF ANYTHING
THAT I MAY BE MISSING?

20:29.429 --> 20:31.131
AND I KNEW A GUY
THAT KNEW A GUY

20:31.164 --> 20:33.500
THAT PUT ME IN TOUCH WITH A GUY
THAT MADE IT ALL HAPPEN.

20:33.533 --> 20:34.567
BOOM.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.002
- LUIS.
- THERE HE IS.

20:36.036 --> 20:37.170
- HOW ARE YOU, SIR?
- HI, BUDDY, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

20:37.203 --> 20:38.438
- GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO.
- WELCOME TO HARLEM.

20:38.471 --> 20:40.540
I'VE GOT A FEW PROPERTIES
FOR YOU TODAY.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.275
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU THE KEYS.
- ALL RIGHT.

20:42.308 --> 20:44.177
SO I WILL BE CALLING YOU.

20:44.210 --> 20:45.478
AND THANKS VERY MUCH, AGAIN.
- NO PROBLEM.

20:45.512 --> 20:46.946
- I KNOW YOU DON'T DO THIS
WITH ANYBODY.

20:46.980 --> 20:49.449
NOW I'M GOING TO SHOW
RACHEL AND REUBEN

20:49.482 --> 20:53.953
WHY I'M THE KING
OF FINDING AMAZING DEALS.

20:53.987 --> 20:55.955
THIS PARTICULAR PROPERTY
THAT I HAVE FOUND FOR THEM

20:55.989 --> 20:57.357
IS TWO PROPERTIES:

20:57.390 --> 20:59.659
ONE NEXT TO EACH OTHER,
OWNED BY THE SAME SELLER.

20:59.693 --> 21:01.428
ONE THAT IS 17 FOOT WIDE

21:01.461 --> 21:03.530
AND THE OTHER ONE
IS 20 FOOT WIDE.

21:03.563 --> 21:05.699
YOU CAN COMBINE THEM BOTH
AND MAKE IT INTO

21:05.732 --> 21:08.802
A 37-FEET WIDE,
12,000 SQUARE-FOOT BUILDING.

21:08.835 --> 21:10.070
ALL RIGHT.

21:10.070 --> 21:13.340
AND IT WAS ONLY ONE BLOCK NORTH
OF 125TH STREET.

21:13.373 --> 21:15.608
SO THIS IS A 17-FOOTER.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.444
- WHAT?
- ARE YOU NOT LISTENING?

21:17.477 --> 21:19.079
- I'M NOT DONE YET.

21:19.079 --> 21:22.449
IT'S A 17-FOOTER
RIGHT NEXT TO A 20-FOOTER,

21:22.482 --> 21:24.617
AND BOTH ARE FOR SALE
BY THE SAME SELLER.

21:24.651 --> 21:25.952
SO THAT TOTALS OUT

21:25.985 --> 21:28.421
TO A LITTLE BIT OVER
12,000 SQUARE FEET.

21:28.455 --> 21:30.690
- OKAY, THAT SOUNDS GOOD.
- ME LIKES.

21:30.724 --> 21:35.862
- ALL RIGHT, SO LET ME SHOW YOU
WHAT WE GOT INSIDE.

21:35.895 --> 21:37.097
- [sighs]

21:37.097 --> 21:38.998
OKAY, WHAT A [bleep]HOLE.
I LOVE IT.

21:39.099 --> 21:40.200
- YOU SAID, "THIS IS A
STRAIGHT-UP [bleep]HOLE,

21:40.233 --> 21:41.468
I LOVE IT"?

21:41.501 --> 21:43.303
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
- I LOVE THAT.

21:43.336 --> 21:44.804
- THAT'S WHAT HE'S LOOKING FOR.

21:44.838 --> 21:46.339
- I'M DEMOLISHING IT ANYWAY.
WHAT DOES IT--

21:46.373 --> 21:47.607
- SEE, YOU GOT EXPOSED BRICK,

21:47.640 --> 21:49.109
WHICH PEOPLE
WILL OBVIOUSLY LOVE.

21:49.109 --> 21:50.777
THE FOUNDATION,
IT'S VERY SOLID.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.880
TOGETHER YOU GOT A TOTAL
OF OVER 12,000 SQUARE FEET.

21:53.913 --> 21:57.117
SO THAT IS
MAYBE 10, 12 UNITS.

21:57.117 --> 22:02.355
THIS IS KIND OF AN OPPORTUNITY
THAT IS VERY RARE TO FIND.

22:02.389 --> 22:04.124
YOU WANTED 6,000,
I GAVE YOU 12,000.

22:04.157 --> 22:05.558
- AND WHAT'S THE PRICE?

22:05.592 --> 22:09.396
- THE PRICE WERE THEY ASKING,
1.2 FOR THIS, FOR THE 20-FOOTER,

22:09.429 --> 22:12.399
AND THE OTHER ONE,
HE'S ASKING 750,000.

22:16.436 --> 22:18.805
IN NEW YORK CITY,
IF YOU BUY SOMETHING

22:18.838 --> 22:20.073
THAT'S OVER
A MILLION DOLLARS,

22:20.073 --> 22:21.474
YOU HAVE TO PAY WHAT IS CALLED
A "MANSION TAX,"

22:21.508 --> 22:23.243
WHICH IS A 1%
OF THE GROSS SALE.

22:23.276 --> 22:25.812
AND LIKE ANY OTHER PEOPLE,
ESPECIALLY DEVELOPERS,

22:25.845 --> 22:27.614
IF THEY CAN AVOID PAYING
THE MANSION TAX,

22:27.647 --> 22:29.349
THEY WILL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

22:29.382 --> 22:31.084
- I THINK I LIKE THIS IDEA,

22:31.084 --> 22:32.452
JUST I'M NOT
PAYING MANSION TAX.

22:32.485 --> 22:34.254
- I THINK WE SHOULD, YOU KNOW--
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

22:34.287 --> 22:36.389
LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN GET
THE RIGHT PRICE,

22:36.423 --> 22:38.291
BUT JUST KNOW THAT THIS
IS AS HOT AS IT GETS.

22:38.324 --> 22:39.693
- I MEAN,
WELL, LET'S SEE.

22:39.726 --> 22:44.264
- AND I THINK I'VE GOT
A GREAT IDEA TO MAKE THIS WORK.

22:49.436 --> 22:51.237
- WELCOME TO 250 BOWERY.

22:51.271 --> 22:53.840
THIS IS OUR SORT OF TEMPORARY
SALES OFFICE FOR THE DAY.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.508
WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE
COMING THROUGH.

22:55.542 --> 22:56.976
AS WITH ANYTHING
IN REAL ESTATE,

22:57.010 --> 22:59.112
PRICES HERE AT 250 BOWERY
IS THE HURDLE--

22:59.145 --> 23:00.113
IS THE REAL HURDLE.

23:00.146 --> 23:01.481
YOU NEED TO WEAR HARD HATS,

23:01.514 --> 23:02.916
AND YOU NEED TO SIGN THIS
CONSTRUCTION WAIVER, PLEASE.

23:02.949 --> 23:04.684
- SURE.
- SAFETY FIRST.

23:04.718 --> 23:05.685
THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE
ON MY LIST

23:05.719 --> 23:06.886
WHO DIDN'T COME
TO THE PARTY

23:06.920 --> 23:07.954
AND THEY HAVEN'T
SEEN THE BUILDING.

23:08.054 --> 23:10.223
SO CALLING THEM'S
A WASTE OF TIME.

23:10.256 --> 23:11.458
I NEED TO GET THEM TO SEE

23:11.491 --> 23:13.259
HOW BEAUTIFUL
THE BUILDING ACTUALLY IS.

23:13.293 --> 23:15.161
FOLLOW ME, GUYS.

23:15.195 --> 23:17.063
SO THIS IS THE THIRD FLOOR.

23:17.097 --> 23:18.898
PENTHOUSE "D,"
ONE OF OUR LARGEST.

23:18.932 --> 23:20.934
HERE'S THE SIXTH FLOOR
ONE-BEDROOM.

23:20.967 --> 23:22.168
THE "E"-LINE.
I LOVE THIS ONE.

23:22.202 --> 23:23.903
AND HERE'S 3-B.

23:23.937 --> 23:25.071
I'M SO HAPPY
THE FLOORS ARE IN NOW,

23:25.105 --> 23:26.139
SO YOU CAN SEE
HOW BEAUTIFUL THEY ARE.

23:26.172 --> 23:28.074
[paper rustles]
LOOK AT THAT FLOOR.

23:28.074 --> 23:29.075
- WHAT IS THAT?
- WHAT WOOD IS THAT?

23:29.075 --> 23:32.078
- OAK.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.947
THIS IS ACTUALLY A RENDERING
OF THE PENTHOUSE,

23:33.980 --> 23:35.982
WHICH IS NICE FOR YOU TO SEE,
SINCE WE'RE IN HERE.

23:36.082 --> 23:39.753
AND THEN ALL GLASS,
FACING BOWERY.

23:39.786 --> 23:41.588
AND IF THE BUYER
IS NOISE-SENSITIVE,

23:41.621 --> 23:43.189
THAT'S THE NOISE.
- YEAH.

23:43.223 --> 23:45.191
- BUT IF YOU CLOSE IT.
- BLOCKS IT RIGHT OUT.

23:45.225 --> 23:46.559
- [imitates suction]
- YEAH.

23:46.593 --> 23:48.128
- AND YOU CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING.

23:48.161 --> 23:50.630
- IT'S VERY QUIET.
both: VERY QUIET.

23:50.663 --> 23:53.867
- $2.2 MILLION, THE PRICE.
NON-NEGOTIABLE.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.268
I CAN'T QUESTION
THESE PRICES.

23:55.301 --> 23:57.737
I GOTTA, IN MY HEART, BELIEVE
THAT THIS IS A GOOD DEAL.

23:57.771 --> 24:01.474
1,625,000.

24:01.508 --> 24:03.643
'CAUSE IF I DON'T,
IT'S GONNA--

24:03.677 --> 24:05.045
PEOPLE ARE GONNA
SEE THAT IN MY EYES.

24:05.045 --> 24:06.446
CAN YOU BELIEVE
THAT THIS APARTMENT

24:06.479 --> 24:08.314
IS ONLY 6.8 MILLION?

24:08.348 --> 24:09.849
AND YOU'RE PAYING
ALL THE CLOSING COSTS,

24:09.883 --> 24:12.052
SO IF YOU WANT THIS,
YOU PROBABLY HAVE TO ACT

24:12.052 --> 24:13.053
WITHIN THE NEXT 20 MINUTES.

24:13.053 --> 24:14.220
- OKAY.
- SERIOUSLY.

24:14.254 --> 24:15.422
I HAVE NO IDEA IF ANYONE
FROM TODAY'S SHOWINGS

24:15.455 --> 24:16.756
WILL ACTUALLY BUY.

24:16.790 --> 24:18.725
- I THINK SHE HAS A CLOSET
BIGGER THAN THIS, THOUGH.

24:18.758 --> 24:20.727
BUT IT COULD BE--
IT MAY WORK AS AN INVESTMENT.

24:20.760 --> 24:24.297
- BUT LUCKILY FOR ME, THERE
IS NO INVENTORY RIGHT NOW,

24:24.330 --> 24:26.399
AND BOWERY IS SO HOT.

24:26.433 --> 24:27.867
HOW DO YOU SAY "HOT"
IN ITALIAN?

24:27.901 --> 24:29.736
both:<i>SPECIALE.</i>
- HUH?

24:29.769 --> 24:30.970
250 BOWERY IS<i>SPECIALE.</i>
- YEAH.

24:31.071 --> 24:33.506
- OKAY.
- VERY GOOD ACCENT.

24:33.540 --> 24:35.141
- I ONLY NEED 16 BUYERS
IN THIS TOWN,

24:35.175 --> 24:36.343
AND I'M GONNA FIND 'EM.

24:36.376 --> 24:38.144
I WON'T SLEEP
UNTIL I'VE DONE IT.

24:38.178 --> 24:40.180
CALL ME.
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

24:40.213 --> 24:42.916
- FULL ASK.
NOTHING ELSE.

24:46.219 --> 24:47.821
- ALL RIGHT, WHAT IS THIS?
- YOU PUT 'EM UNDER THE BED.

24:47.854 --> 24:48.855
- IT'S A PLATFORM
FOR ONE OF THE BEDS.

24:48.888 --> 24:51.124
OKAY, SO LET'S PUT THIS HERE.

24:51.157 --> 24:53.093
WE ONLY HAVE TWO DAYS
BEFORE THE BROKER PARTY,

24:53.093 --> 24:55.161
BUT I WALK
INTO A TOTAL DISASTER.

24:55.195 --> 24:56.463
LET'S MOVE THESE OUT.

24:56.496 --> 24:57.497
THE FURNITURE
HASN'T BEEN MOVED OUT.

24:57.530 --> 24:58.732
[grunts]

24:58.765 --> 25:00.166
THE DESIGNER HAS QUIT.

25:00.200 --> 25:02.836
JILL IS FLOATING OFF
IN NEVER-NEVER LAND.

25:02.869 --> 25:06.039
BUT WHAT DO YOU DO IN MOMENTS
OF STRESS AND CRISIS?

25:06.039 --> 25:07.841
YOU TAKE CONTROL.
OKAY.

25:07.874 --> 25:08.875
THIS IS WHAT I DO.

25:08.908 --> 25:10.110
- HI.
- HI, NANCY.

25:10.143 --> 25:11.311
- HEY, YOU'VE MET HER.
- HI.

25:11.344 --> 25:13.613
- SO I GOT ON THE PHONE
AND I CALLED IN A FAVOR

25:13.646 --> 25:15.415
FROM A DESIGNER FRIEND OF MINE

25:15.448 --> 25:17.384
WHO CAN TAKE THE BULL
BY THE HORNS AND FIX THIS THING.

25:17.417 --> 25:18.585
AND SO YOU HAVE
THE FURNITURE PLANS?

25:18.618 --> 25:19.919
- YES, I DO.
- EVERYTHING'S BEEN THROUGH IT?

25:19.953 --> 25:21.054
OKAY, GREAT.
- YEAH.

25:21.087 --> 25:22.055
- AND THEN I CALLED
THE FURNITURE MOVERS

25:22.088 --> 25:25.258
AND NOW WE'RE BACK ON TRACK.

25:25.291 --> 25:27.060
THERE YOU GO.
- I'M SO HAPPY THEY HAVE

25:27.060 --> 25:28.928
ALL THESE BEDS,
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE

25:28.962 --> 25:31.197
I'M IN MY SEVENTH HOUR
OF LABOR

25:31.231 --> 25:33.299
AND I'M JUST
ABOUT TO GIVE BIRTH.

25:33.333 --> 25:35.802
[laughter]

25:35.835 --> 25:38.071
- THAT'S INTERESTING.
- SERIOUSLY.

25:38.104 --> 25:40.306
- DO YOU MIND HELPING US
PUT THIS DOWN?

25:40.340 --> 25:42.075
- BACK OUT.
HERE WE GO.

25:42.075 --> 25:43.343
[groans]

25:43.376 --> 25:44.944
- NO MORE SHAG.

25:44.978 --> 25:46.346
I-I FIGURED IT OUT.

25:47.414 --> 25:48.481
- SOLUTION.

25:48.515 --> 25:49.749
- I KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO

25:49.783 --> 25:52.452
MOVE OUT THIS WHOLE
<i>AUSTIN POWERS</i>FEEL.

25:52.485 --> 25:54.120
SO I'M THINKING
WHAT WE CAN DO

25:54.154 --> 25:55.522
IS TO GET, LIKE,
WHAT YOU GUYS

25:55.555 --> 25:56.856
USE TO SHAVE YOUR HEAD.

25:56.890 --> 25:57.891
YOU KNOW,
THOSE THINGS THAT--

25:57.924 --> 25:59.526
YOU KNOW,
WHAT ARE THOSE SHAVERS--

25:59.559 --> 26:01.127
- I THINK A LAWNMOWER--
- WHAT'S A SHAVER?

26:01.161 --> 26:02.295
LIKE, A LAWNMOWER
FOR YOUR HEAD.

26:02.328 --> 26:05.031
- JUST, LIKE--
LIKE THE BARBER CLIPPERS.

26:05.031 --> 26:07.567
- YOU KNOW, WE CAN GET RID
OF THAT<i>AUSTIN POWERS</i>FEEL

26:07.600 --> 26:08.868
WITH AN ELECTRIC RAZOR.

26:08.902 --> 26:09.869
IF WE HAVE TO GET ON THE FLOOR
AND SHAVE THEM.

26:09.903 --> 26:11.037
- SO YOU WANT
TO TAKE THE RUG

26:11.037 --> 26:12.038
AND YOU WANNA
RUN A LAWNMOWER OVER IT?

26:12.038 --> 26:13.239
- I WANNA RUN
A LAWNMOWER OVER IT.

26:13.273 --> 26:14.474
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

26:14.507 --> 26:16.443
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
AN EASY LISTING FOR ME,

26:16.476 --> 26:17.877
AND NOW I'M DOING
ALL THE WORK!

26:17.911 --> 26:22.048
AND JILL, INSTEAD OF HELPING,
IS LOSING HER MIND.

26:22.048 --> 26:26.052
YOU KNOW, WE'RE--WE'RE RENTING
THE FURNITURE AND THE RUGS.

26:26.052 --> 26:28.221
- WELL,
MAYBE THEY WON'T NOTICE.

26:28.254 --> 26:31.257
- I THINK SO.

26:39.232 --> 26:41.634
- ROB. THERE HE IS.
- HEY, LUIS.

26:41.668 --> 26:43.770
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING
TO THIS SIDE OF THE BORDER.

26:43.803 --> 26:44.804
- RACHEL AND REUBEN

26:44.838 --> 26:46.673
LIKE THE TWO BUILDINGS
ON 126TH STREET,

26:46.706 --> 26:48.975
BUT I NEED TO MAKE SURE
TO GET THEM BOTH

26:49.075 --> 26:50.276
UNDER $1 MILLION
SO THAT THEY

26:50.310 --> 26:51.745
CAN AVOID
ON PAYING THE MANSION TAX,

26:51.778 --> 26:54.547
OR THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY
WALK AWAY FROM THE DEAL.

26:54.581 --> 26:56.549
YOU'RE ASKING 1.2 FOR ONE,
AND 750?

26:56.583 --> 26:58.752
- YES.
- THAT IS VERY AMBITIOUS.

26:58.785 --> 27:00.086
- IT'S AGGRESSIVE,

27:00.120 --> 27:01.788
BUT THE MARKET'S AGGRESSIVE,
SO WHAT CAN I SAY?

27:01.821 --> 27:04.557
- WHAT IF WE OFFERED YOUR SELLER
SOMETHING HE CAN'T REFUSE?

27:04.591 --> 27:06.393
LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE,
WHAT IF WE BUY BOTH BUILDINGS?

27:06.426 --> 27:11.031
NOW, LET'S SAY 900,000 EACH.

27:11.064 --> 27:13.533
- SO AT THE END OF THE DAY,

27:13.566 --> 27:15.635
HE WANTS A COUPLE OF MILLION
FOR THESE TWO BUILDINGS,

27:15.669 --> 27:16.836
JUST SHY OF 2 MILLION,

27:16.870 --> 27:18.405
AND YOU'RE OFFERING
1.8 FOR THE PACKAGE?

27:18.438 --> 27:19.439
- YES.

27:19.472 --> 27:21.141
- I WANT TO REMIND YOU
AND YOUR CLIENT

27:21.174 --> 27:23.109
THAT IT'S IN
THE HISTORIC DISTRICT.

27:23.143 --> 27:25.912
- YUP.
- IT'S A 20-FOOT-WIDE BUILDING.

27:25.945 --> 27:28.148
THESE THINGS
ADD A LOT OF VALUE.

27:28.181 --> 27:29.816
AND WITH ALL OF
THE INVENTORY ISSUES

27:29.849 --> 27:31.051
THAT WE'RE HAVING RIGHT NOW,

27:31.051 --> 27:33.753
FOR THE 20-FOOTER,
YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO BE

27:33.787 --> 27:37.557
NORTH OF 1 MILLION.

27:37.590 --> 27:39.526
- DO YOU HAVE
A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP

27:39.559 --> 27:41.161
WITH YOUR INVESTORS?
- YES.

27:41.194 --> 27:43.396
- THIS IS THE KIND OF BUYER
THAT WILL BUY

27:43.430 --> 27:44.831
NOT ONLY ONE,
BUT TWO, BUT THREE,

27:44.864 --> 27:46.666
MAYBE BUY AN ENTIRE BLOCK
IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS.

27:46.700 --> 27:49.803
- THAT'S EXACTLY
WHY I'M HERE.

27:49.836 --> 27:51.071
- OKAY, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

27:51.071 --> 27:52.672
YOU HAVE 750
FOR THE SMALLER ONE.

27:52.706 --> 27:54.607
- YES.
- WE'LL PAY 850 FOR THAT ONE.

27:54.641 --> 27:57.544
AND THEN WE'LL TAKE
THE 20-FOOTER OFF YOUR HANDS,

27:57.577 --> 28:01.314
JUST TO MAKE THINGS QUICKER,
FOR 999, JUST UNDER A MILLION.

28:03.583 --> 28:06.219
- YOU CAN DIVIDE IT UP
HOWEVER YOU WANT.

28:06.252 --> 28:07.520
RIGHT NOW,
WHAT YOU'RE OFFERING ME,

28:07.554 --> 28:10.323
IT'S FOR BOTH BUILDINGS, 1.850.
- YEAH.

28:10.357 --> 28:11.658
- UM...

28:11.691 --> 28:14.527
LET ME CALL MY SELLER
AND GET BACK TO YOU TOMORROW.

28:14.561 --> 28:16.062
- ARE YOU AMAZING,
OR ARE YOU AMAZING?

28:16.096 --> 28:17.230
- I HOPE SO.
- OKAY.

28:17.263 --> 28:19.199
- THANKS, LUIS.

28:19.232 --> 28:22.402
- GET HER ON THE PHONE.
THIS IS SUCH BULL[bleep].

28:22.435 --> 28:23.937
- I DON'T EVEN WANT TO CALL HER.
- THIS IS SUCH BULL[bleep].

28:24.037 --> 28:25.672
SHE DIDN'T EVEN TELL US
THAT THIS WAS HAPPENING?

28:25.705 --> 28:26.673
THIS IS NOT A REAL EXCUSE.

28:26.706 --> 28:27.874
- THE MAILBOX IS FULL

28:27.907 --> 28:30.076
AND CANNOT ACCEPT
ANY MESSAGES AT THIS TIME.

28:30.110 --> 28:31.711
[banging phone]

28:37.350 --> 28:39.619
- ALL RIGHT, SO, YOU'RE
GONNA WALK FORWARD TWO STEPS

28:39.652 --> 28:40.620
AND THEN SIDE-TOGETHER
TOWARDS ME.

28:40.653 --> 28:43.256
- OUR WEDDING
IS COMING UP FAST,

28:43.289 --> 28:44.824
AND PREPARING
FOR OUR FIRST DANCE

28:44.858 --> 28:46.292
AS A MARRIED COUPLE

28:46.326 --> 28:48.294
IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN
PUTTING OFF FOR A WHILE...

28:48.328 --> 28:49.529
- ONE, TWO...

28:49.562 --> 28:51.064
SIDE-TOGETHER TOWARDS ME.
SIDE--

28:51.097 --> 28:52.198
- OH, SIDE.
- UH-HUH.

28:52.232 --> 28:53.466
both: ONE, TWO...

28:53.500 --> 28:55.068
- SIDE-TOGETHER OVER HERE.

28:55.101 --> 28:56.169
- OH, WHA--

28:56.202 --> 28:57.637
OH, MY GOD,
I'M ALREADY CONFUSED.

28:57.671 --> 28:59.305
WHICH IS KIND OF OBVIOUS.

28:59.339 --> 29:00.840
AH--NO!

29:00.874 --> 29:01.841
- ONE, TWO...

29:01.875 --> 29:02.842
- [grunts]
- UH-HUH.

29:02.876 --> 29:05.612
- AH!

29:05.645 --> 29:10.016
WHAT ABOUT SOMETHING
MORE, LIKE, FREESTYLE-Y?

29:10.050 --> 29:13.019
[upbeat, jazzy music]

29:13.053 --> 29:21.061
* *

29:28.068 --> 29:30.036
[trills tongue]

29:30.070 --> 29:31.938
- OKAY,
SO LET'S TRY THAT AGAIN.

29:32.038 --> 29:33.540
A-ONE, TWO...
- WHEE!

29:45.685 --> 29:46.820
- WHO'S THAT?

29:46.853 --> 29:49.122
THIS IS RYAN.

29:49.155 --> 29:50.557
HEY, JOHN.
WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN?

29:56.730 --> 29:58.798
UM...

29:58.832 --> 30:00.500
OKAY...

30:05.105 --> 30:07.140
OKAY.

30:07.173 --> 30:08.575
UM...

30:08.608 --> 30:10.276
JOHN IS A VERY IMPORTANT
CLIENT FOR ME.

30:10.310 --> 30:13.013
HE'S BOUGHT A LOT OF PROPERTIES
IN THE CITY AS INVESTMENTS,

30:13.046 --> 30:14.981
AND I WANNA MAKE SURE
THAT I AM HIS BROKER

30:15.015 --> 30:16.549
ON EVERY TRANSACTION
HE DOES.

30:16.583 --> 30:18.284
UH, AWESOME, GREAT.

30:18.318 --> 30:20.353
WELL, LOOK,
THANKS FOR CALLING,

30:20.387 --> 30:23.189
AND I WILL LET YOU KNOW.

30:23.223 --> 30:25.959
[sighs]
BYE.

30:25.992 --> 30:29.162
EVEN THOUGH DEALING WITH FREDRIK
IS THE LAST THING I WANNA DO,

30:29.195 --> 30:31.664
I'LL DO IT
BECAUSE IT'S BUSINESS.

30:31.698 --> 30:33.500
WHAT IS THIS?

30:33.533 --> 30:35.135
I PRINTED THIS OUT.

30:35.168 --> 30:37.103
- IT'S THE INVITE
FOR THE PARTY ON THURSDAY.

30:37.137 --> 30:38.705
- FOR THE BROKER PARTY?

30:38.738 --> 30:40.507
- IT'S COMING UP.

30:40.540 --> 30:41.508
- CAN YOU COME HERE
FOR ONE SECOND?

30:41.541 --> 30:42.676
- YEAH.

30:42.709 --> 30:44.344
- AH, I DON'T THINK
WE CAN REDO THIS,

30:44.377 --> 30:46.279
BUT I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THIS COLORING IS.

30:46.312 --> 30:48.114
THIS, LIKE, TEAL BLUE CRAP.

30:48.148 --> 30:49.416
IT LOOKS REALLY CHEAP,

30:49.449 --> 30:50.550
IT LOOKS LIKE WE THREW
A BUNCH OF THINGS TOGETHER.

30:50.583 --> 30:52.786
THIS IS NOT AN INVITE
THAT WE CREATE

30:52.819 --> 30:54.654
FOR A $15 MILLION LISTING.

30:54.688 --> 30:56.589
NO ONE'S GONNA COME TO THIS.

30:56.623 --> 30:57.957
IS JILL--WHERE ARE WE
ON THE BROKER PARTY?

30:57.991 --> 31:01.327
- UM, CATERING IS STILL UP
IN THE AIR, UNFORTUNATELY, BUT--

31:01.361 --> 31:03.830
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

31:03.863 --> 31:06.599
WE DON'T HAVE ANY FOOD OR DRINKS
FOR THE BROKER PARTY?

31:06.633 --> 31:09.269
SO WHY DIDN'T JILL
GET ON THIS EARLIER?

31:09.302 --> 31:11.171
- I DON'T KNOW.
I WAS TEXTING HER.

31:11.204 --> 31:12.972
HER RESPONSE WAS,

31:13.073 --> 31:15.075
"I HAVE A MEDICAL EMERGENCY
AND JUST GOT ON THE TRAIN

31:15.075 --> 31:17.444
TO GO SEE A SPECIALIST
IN CONNECTICUT."

31:17.477 --> 31:19.679
I ASKED HER WHAT IS WRONG,
SHE SAID SHE'S NOT SURE

31:19.713 --> 31:22.615
AND THAT HER WHOLE BODY
IS ON FIRE,

31:22.649 --> 31:24.818
SHE'S ITCHING LIKE CRAZY,
AND IT STARTED DURING STAGING

31:24.851 --> 31:27.087
AND HAS GOTTEN
PROGRESSIVELY WORSE.

31:27.120 --> 31:29.255
IS SHE ALLERGIC TO FURNITURE?
- I GUESS.

31:29.289 --> 31:32.459
- GET HER ON THE PHONE.
THIS IS SUCH BULL[bleep].

31:32.492 --> 31:34.094
- I DON'T EVEN WANNA CALL HER.
CAN YOU CALL HER?

31:34.094 --> 31:35.462
- SHE DIDN'T EVEN TELL US
THAT THIS WAS HAPPENING?

31:35.495 --> 31:36.963
IT'S A $15 MILLION PENTHOUSE.

31:36.996 --> 31:39.165
THIS IS GONNA MAKE ME LOOK
LIKE A TOTAL AMATEUR.

31:39.199 --> 31:40.834
THIS IS NOT A REAL EXCUSE.

31:40.867 --> 31:42.902
WE HAD THE OPEN HOUSE,
OLIVIA'S DOING ALL THE WORK,

31:42.936 --> 31:45.472
PEOPLE ARE CALLING,
WE'RE--AH--AH--

31:45.505 --> 31:46.673
I WANNA, LIKE,
TAKE HER AND JUST, LIKE,

31:46.706 --> 31:47.974
STICK HER IN A LITTLE THING

31:48.008 --> 31:50.410
AND THE CHINESE THINGS
AND THE FINGER TRAPS.

31:50.443 --> 31:52.112
THAT THING TAKES TOO LONG.
I'M GONNA CALL HER.

31:52.112 --> 31:53.847
WHAT--WHAT'S HER PHONE NUMBER?
WHAT'S HER PHONE NUMBER?

31:53.880 --> 31:56.116
THIS IS--YOU KNOW, HER
PHONE NUMBER'S SPELLED RIGHT.

31:56.116 --> 31:59.786
MINE'S MISSING THREE DIGITS.
[laughs, titters]

31:59.819 --> 32:02.422
3-4-4-2-3...
[phone line ringing]

32:02.455 --> 32:03.490
IS THAT MY PHONE--
HOW WOULD YOU--

32:03.523 --> 32:04.824
HOW WOULD YOU
BE ABLE TO CALL THAT?

32:04.858 --> 32:07.794
NO--THERE'S NO AREA CODE.

32:07.827 --> 32:09.562
[phone line ringing]

32:09.596 --> 32:11.064
- YOUR CALL
HAS BEEN FORWARDED

32:11.097 --> 32:15.468
TO AN AUTOMATED
VOICE MESSAGING SYSTEM.

32:15.502 --> 32:16.670
THE MAILBOX IS FULL

32:16.703 --> 32:18.571
AND CANNOT ACCEPT
ANY MESSAGES AT THIS TIME.

32:18.605 --> 32:21.341
[banging phone]

32:21.374 --> 32:23.109
- THIS IS A TOTAL NIGHTMARE.

32:23.143 --> 32:26.079
WE HAVE NO CATERER,
A STUPID INVITATION,

32:26.079 --> 32:27.847
AND MY CO-BROKER
HAS GONE MISSING.

32:27.881 --> 32:29.916
[grunts]

32:29.949 --> 32:31.785
I-I'M NOT SURE
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

32:31.818 --> 32:33.586
I NEED YOU
TO REPLACE MY PHONE.

32:50.770 --> 32:52.439
- I AM SO STRESSED.

32:52.472 --> 32:56.776
SINCE THE FIRST EIGHT CONTRACTS,
I HAVEN'T DONE ONE MORE DEAL.

32:56.810 --> 32:58.812
I'VE CALLED EVERYONE WHO CAME
TO THE PRIVATE SHOWINGS,

32:58.845 --> 33:01.548
AND SO FAR,
NOT A SINGLE OFFER.

33:01.581 --> 33:03.249
[sighs]

33:03.283 --> 33:05.185
I'M TRYING TO THINK
OF BUYERS OF MINE

33:05.218 --> 33:07.754
LOOKING IN
OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS.

33:07.787 --> 33:08.822
I'M STARTING
FROM SCRATCH, HERE.

33:08.855 --> 33:10.156
[flutters lips]

33:10.190 --> 33:13.727
MY LIST USED TO BE
900 PEOPLE, AND NOW,

33:13.760 --> 33:17.864
BACK TO ZERO.

33:17.897 --> 33:23.903
[cell phone ringing]

33:27.540 --> 33:29.542
YES?

33:33.747 --> 33:35.081
I'M GOOD.

33:35.115 --> 33:39.919
I'M IN A FIVE-STAR RESTAURANT
WITH SOME GOOD FRIENDS.

34:04.511 --> 34:07.347
HE WANTS MY BUILDING.

34:09.215 --> 34:10.417
THIS IS AMAZING.

34:10.450 --> 34:12.052
I LOVE THIS.
I LOVE THAT HE'S CALLING ME.

34:12.052 --> 34:14.654
I'M GOING TO ENJOY THIS.

34:14.688 --> 34:18.658
WELL, YOU KNOW,
WE HAVE A FEW LEFT. UH...

34:18.692 --> 34:21.161
BUT I MEAN,
I HAVE A WAITING LIST.

34:21.194 --> 34:23.163
[crumples paper]

34:23.196 --> 34:25.065
AND IT WAS VERY INSULTING

34:25.065 --> 34:28.201
WHEN YOU DID WHAT YOU DID
AT MY OPENING PARTY.

34:35.108 --> 34:38.078
OKAY, FINE.

34:38.111 --> 34:40.480
COME TO MY OFFICE TOMORROW,
LET'S SAY 2:00 P.M.

34:40.513 --> 34:43.717
WITH NO DRAMA,

34:43.750 --> 34:45.485
SCREAMING, AND FIGHTING.

34:45.518 --> 34:46.619
- SURE.

34:48.154 --> 34:50.123
- CHEERS, [indistinct].

34:50.156 --> 34:51.358
[glass clinks]

34:51.391 --> 34:53.460
AHH...

35:00.533 --> 35:03.036
- ALL RIGHT, HOW ARE YOU GUYS?
- HEY, LUIS.

35:03.069 --> 35:04.671
- SORRY I'M LATE. HOW ARE YOU?
- HI. HOW ARE YOU?

35:04.704 --> 35:06.172
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

35:06.206 --> 35:07.741
HOW ABOUT WE CAN GET SOME WINE,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

35:07.774 --> 35:09.909
- UM, SURE.

35:09.943 --> 35:12.145
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

35:12.178 --> 35:14.614
- ALL RIGHT, SO LET'S
HEAR ABOUT THESE DEALS.

35:14.647 --> 35:16.049
- OKAY.

35:16.049 --> 35:18.251
SO HE WANTED 750
FOR THE 17-FOOTER,

35:18.284 --> 35:20.587
HE WANTED $1.2 MILLION
FOR THE 20-FOOTER.

35:20.620 --> 35:21.755
- RIGHT.

35:21.788 --> 35:23.490
- SO THIS IS WHAT
WE CAME DOWN TO.

35:23.523 --> 35:26.359
THE WHOLE PACKAGE, THE SELLER
WOULD SELL IT AT 1.9 MILLION.

35:26.393 --> 35:28.595
NOW, THIS
IS THE GREATEST PART.

35:28.628 --> 35:31.264
IF WE STRUCTURE THE DEAL
AT 950, 950 EACH,

35:31.297 --> 35:33.900
WE GO UNDERNEATH $1 MILLION
AND WE AVOID THE MANSION TAX,

35:33.933 --> 35:35.235
WHICH IS 1%.

35:35.268 --> 35:37.237
SO YOU GET TO BUILD
12 APARTMENTS IN IT,

35:37.270 --> 35:38.972
YOU GET TO SELL THEM AT,
I DON'T KNOW, $700 A FOOT.

35:39.072 --> 35:41.908
- AS GREAT AS IT SOUNDS
ON PAPER, THERE ARE,

35:41.941 --> 35:45.578
YOU KNOW, SERIOUS RISKS
AND POSSIBILITY.

35:45.612 --> 35:48.114
- THIS IS THE THING:
WE NEED TO ACT NOW.

35:48.148 --> 35:52.252
HE WANTS AN ANSWER BY TODAY.

35:52.285 --> 35:55.522
FINDING TWO BUILDINGS
NEXT TO EACH OTHER IN HARLEM

35:55.555 --> 35:57.657
AT THIS POINT IN TIME
IS EXTREMELY RARE.

35:57.691 --> 36:00.560
I MEAN, IT'LL PROBABLY
SNOW IN PUERTO RICO

36:00.593 --> 36:03.029
BEFORE THEY FIND THEMSELVES
A DEAL LIKE THIS AGAIN.

36:03.029 --> 36:04.364
SO I THINK THIS
IS THE KIND OF CHANCE

36:04.397 --> 36:08.268
THAT YOU EITHER GO BIG
OR DON'T DO ANYTHING AT ALL.

36:10.036 --> 36:11.838
- OKAY, SO, WE'RE GOING
BEYOND THE PARAMETERS

36:11.871 --> 36:13.373
OF WHAT WE DISCUSSED,

36:13.406 --> 36:15.809
BUT IF WE CAN SELL
AT 600 A SQUARE FOOT,

36:15.842 --> 36:18.611
I THINK WE CAN PAY
THAT EXTRA.

36:18.645 --> 36:20.113
YOU ALSO--
WHEN YOU COMBINE THE TWO,

36:20.146 --> 36:22.215
YOU'RE GONNA ELIMINATE
CERTAIN COSTS OR AT LEAST...

36:22.248 --> 36:26.386
- BOOM, YOU SEE?
- SHARE THE COST, SO...

36:26.419 --> 36:27.387
THE QUESTION IS DO YOU--
ARE YOU REALLY CONFIDENT--

36:27.420 --> 36:28.588
- THINGS ARE ONLY
GETTING BETTER,

36:28.621 --> 36:30.090
SO I JUST SEE IT HAPPENING.

36:30.123 --> 36:31.524
- YOU THINK WE'RE GOOD?
- WE'RE GOOD, YEAH.

36:31.558 --> 36:32.559
LET'S GO WITH IT. YEP.
- YEAH?

36:32.592 --> 36:35.595
- I DON'T WANNA
LOSE THIS ONE.

36:35.628 --> 36:38.765
- ALL RIGHT, LUIS.
MAKE IT HAPPEN.

36:38.798 --> 36:40.100
MAKE THE LADY HAPPY.

36:40.133 --> 36:42.435
- I AM GOING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN,
AND SHE'S ALREADY HAPPY.

36:42.469 --> 36:43.970
NOW I'M IN
THE DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS.

36:44.070 --> 36:45.805
I KNEW
THAT ALL IT WOULD TAKE

36:45.839 --> 36:48.074
WAS HARD WORK
AND PERSISTENCE.

36:48.074 --> 36:50.276
ALL RIGHT!
[laughs]

36:50.310 --> 36:52.712
- WELL, AS THEY SAY,
ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL, SO...

36:52.746 --> 36:54.247
-<i>L'CHAIM.</i>
<i>- BARUCH ATAH ADONAI.</i>

36:54.280 --> 36:55.315
- CHEERS.
- THERE YOU GO.

36:55.348 --> 36:58.284
<i>SALUD.</i>

37:06.393 --> 37:09.529
- HI, FREDRIK.
UH, RYAN SER...

37:09.562 --> 37:10.830
- HANT. HANT, YEAH.
- IS HERE TO SEE YOU.

37:10.864 --> 37:13.033
- MM-HMM.
- OKAY.

37:13.033 --> 37:14.467
- FOLLOW ME
TO THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

37:14.501 --> 37:18.371
- FREDRIK HAS AGREED TO MEET ME
TO NEGOTIATE A UNIT.

37:18.405 --> 37:20.040
- YOU CAN HAVE A SEAT.

37:20.040 --> 37:21.708
- JOHN REALLY WANTS
IN THE BUILDING,

37:21.741 --> 37:25.645
AND HE'S TRUSTING ME AS
HIS BROKER TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN.

37:25.679 --> 37:30.150
SO I JUST NEED TO HOLD
MY [bleep] TOGETHER

37:30.183 --> 37:34.621
FOR ONE SIT-DOWN
WITH [bleep]STICK--FREDRIK.

37:40.927 --> 37:42.829
- [inhales, flutters lips]

37:42.862 --> 37:44.230
THIS IS AMAZING.

37:44.264 --> 37:46.733
RYAN NEEDS TO GET
INTO THIS BUILDING,

37:46.766 --> 37:48.968
AND I HAPPEN TO HAVE A COUPLE
OF ONE-BEDROOMS.

37:49.069 --> 37:50.904
SOME GREEN TEA?

37:50.937 --> 37:52.372
- NO.

37:52.405 --> 37:53.973
- LET ME CLOSE THIS.
- SURE.

37:54.074 --> 37:55.508
- BUT I'M GOING
TO TRY TO SELL HIM

37:55.542 --> 37:58.378
THE MOST EXPENSIVE ONE-BEDROOM
IN THE BUILDING.

37:58.411 --> 37:59.379
I CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS.

37:59.412 --> 38:01.081
I'M GONNA SELL ANOTHER UNIT,

38:01.114 --> 38:03.016
AND I'M GONNA SCREW
RYAN SERHANT AT THE SAME TIME.

38:03.016 --> 38:06.553
[groans]
HOW ARE YOU?

38:06.586 --> 38:08.922
- OKAY.
HOW ARE YOU?

38:09.022 --> 38:10.290
- BUSY. REALLY BUSY.

38:10.323 --> 38:13.159
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
IT'S LIKE, "WHOA!"

38:13.193 --> 38:16.129
OH--OH! SO MANY.
OH, OH, OH.

38:16.162 --> 38:19.165
DEAL SHEETS
AND INTEREST LISTS AND...

38:19.199 --> 38:21.101
- [growling]

38:21.134 --> 38:23.036
- OH! OOH--WHOA!

38:23.069 --> 38:25.472
- IT'S LIKE--GOD.

38:25.505 --> 38:27.207
I JUST--
I DON'T LIKE THIS GUY.

38:27.240 --> 38:30.510
[clears throat]

38:30.543 --> 38:32.045
SO, HERE'S THE DEAL.

38:32.078 --> 38:35.315
HE WANTS A ONE-BEDROOM.

38:35.348 --> 38:38.084
- THIS ONE.
6-C, THE MOST EXPENSIVE ONE.

38:38.118 --> 38:43.923
THE PRICE IS 1.175,
AND IT'S 645 SQUARE FEET.

38:43.957 --> 38:46.326
SO ALMOST 2,000 A FOOT...

38:46.359 --> 38:49.829
FOR A ONE-BEDROOM.

38:49.863 --> 38:50.830
- THAT'S STUPID.

38:50.864 --> 38:51.831
- OH, REALLY?
- UH-HUH.

38:51.865 --> 38:53.199
- HOW IS THAT?

38:53.233 --> 38:56.102
- IT'S A STUPID PRICE TO PAY
FOR THIS APARTMENT.

38:56.136 --> 38:57.437
BUT THAT'S OKAY,
THAT'S OKAY, THAT'S OKAY.

38:57.470 --> 38:58.605
I DON'T--YOU KNOW,
IT--IT'S--

38:58.638 --> 39:00.240
- WHY ARE YOU SO ANGRY?

39:00.273 --> 39:01.875
- I'M NOT ANGRY.

39:01.908 --> 39:04.077
- I DON'T THINK YOU'RE EVER
GONNA BE NOT ANGRY AT ME

39:04.110 --> 39:08.915
UNTIL YOU START
DOING BETTER THAN ME.

39:09.015 --> 39:13.687
OH, AND YOU HAVE TO PAY
THE CLOSING COST.

39:13.720 --> 39:16.189
- WHAT ELSE YOU HAVE?
- NOTHING ELSE.

39:16.222 --> 39:18.158
- I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
WHAT ABOUT A LOWER FLOOR?

39:18.191 --> 39:21.561
DO YOU HAVE 5-C AVAILABLE?
- NO.

39:21.594 --> 39:24.230
- WHAT ABOUT 4-C?
- NO.

39:24.264 --> 39:25.331
- WHAT ABOUT 3-C?
- RYAN--

39:25.365 --> 39:26.433
- WHAT ABOUT 3-C?

39:26.466 --> 39:27.434
- WE DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF OPTIONS HERE.

39:27.467 --> 39:29.035
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME.

39:29.069 --> 39:31.371
PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT
WHEN YOU'RE A LISTING BROKER

39:31.404 --> 39:34.107
OF AN ENTIRE BUILDING,
YOU CONTROL EVERYTHING,

39:34.140 --> 39:37.277
SO I CAN RELEASE THE UNITS
THE WAY THAT I WANT.

39:37.310 --> 39:38.545
- AND THERE'S
NOTHING ELSE AVAILABLE?

39:38.578 --> 39:41.581
- NO. NO.

39:44.617 --> 39:46.686
- YOU DON'T GIVE A [bleep]
ABOUT ANYBODY BUT YOURSELF.

39:46.720 --> 39:49.122
YOU ARE SWINDLING PEOPLE,

39:49.155 --> 39:50.423
AND I HATE
LOOKING AT YOUR FACE.

39:57.630 --> 39:59.299
- DO YOU WANT 6-C OR NOT?

39:59.332 --> 40:01.701
- CAN YOU DO
A BETTER DEAL ON IT?

40:01.735 --> 40:04.437
LET'S DO 1.15, AND WE'LL
STILL PAY THE CLOSING COST.

40:04.471 --> 40:05.739
- DO WHAT?
DO A DISCOUNT?

40:05.772 --> 40:07.540
- 1.15.
- NO.

40:07.574 --> 40:09.409
- I'LL TAKE IT RIGHT NOW.
- NO.

40:09.442 --> 40:10.543
- BUT NOW THIS IS--

40:10.577 --> 40:11.745
- YOU KNOW,
WITH THIS INTEREST LIST--

40:11.778 --> 40:12.779
PEOPLE ARE WAITING.

40:12.812 --> 40:14.748
WHA--SUPPLY AND DEMAND,
ISN'T IT?

40:14.781 --> 40:17.550
- I HAVE NO POWER
IN THIS SITUATION, WHICH SUCKS,

40:17.584 --> 40:19.319
SO I'VE GOTTA
TAKE HIS WORD FOR IT.

40:19.352 --> 40:20.620
YOU KNOW, IT'S, LIKE,
IT'S A POKER MATCH,

40:20.653 --> 40:23.089
BUT I-I HAVE NO CHIPS.

40:23.123 --> 40:25.392
BECAUSE I'M THE ONE WHO NEEDS
EVERYTHING FROM THIS GUY.

40:25.425 --> 40:27.427
- 1.175 CASH.

40:27.460 --> 40:29.696
I'M SMILING
'CAUSE IT SOUNDS SO GOOD.

40:29.729 --> 40:30.697
1.175.
SAY IT.

40:30.730 --> 40:32.065
DOESN'T IT
SOUND GOOD TO YOU?

40:32.098 --> 40:33.366
- NO, IT DOESN'T
SOUND GOOD TO ME.

40:33.400 --> 40:34.934
- PLUS THE CLOSING COST.
SAY IT.

40:34.968 --> 40:38.071
SPEAK TO YOUR CLIENT
AND GET BACK TO ME, HOW'S THAT?

40:38.104 --> 40:42.742
- I DON'T HAVE TO SPEAK TO HIM.
I KNOW WHAT HE WANTS TO DO.

40:42.776 --> 40:45.845
[sighs]

40:45.879 --> 40:49.416
OKAY, FINE.

40:49.449 --> 40:50.750
FINE.
SO WE'LL DO 6-C.

40:50.784 --> 40:52.285
OKAY?
- GREAT.

40:52.318 --> 40:53.553
SO WE HAVE A DEAL, DO WE?

40:53.586 --> 40:54.654
ARE YOU AUTHORIZED
TO DO THE DEAL?

40:54.688 --> 40:59.225
- MM-HMM.
- AT FULL ASK? NO DISCOUNT?

40:59.259 --> 41:01.828
NO CONCESSIONS?
1.175.

41:01.861 --> 41:05.665
2 1/2% COMMISSION TO YOU,
2 1/2% COMMISSION TO ME.

41:05.699 --> 41:07.734
I'LL SEND YOU THE OFFER PLAN
AND THE CONTRACTS,

41:07.767 --> 41:10.203
AND CONGRATS, I GUESS.

41:10.236 --> 41:11.504
- EVEN THOUGH
DEALING WITH FREDRIK

41:11.538 --> 41:15.608
HAS BEEN
A MISERABLE EXPERIENCE...

41:15.642 --> 41:17.644
WAAH!
- [laughs]

41:17.677 --> 41:19.879
- I'M GLAD THAT I WAS ABLE
TO GET JOHN THE APARTMENT.

41:19.913 --> 41:21.748
AND NOW THAT IT'S DONE,
I CAN SAY

41:21.781 --> 41:24.417
WHAT I'VE BEEN WANTING TO SAY
FOR A LONG TIME.

41:24.451 --> 41:26.086
SO HERE'S THE DEAL.

41:26.086 --> 41:27.620
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO SPEND
ANY MORE TIME HERE.

41:27.654 --> 41:29.823
THIS WHOLE OFFICE
JUST MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE.

41:29.856 --> 41:31.091
- WHY IS THAT?

41:31.091 --> 41:32.759
THE TOP-PRODUCING OFFICE
IN THE WORLD, PER CAPITA.

41:32.792 --> 41:33.993
- IT'S WEIRD.

41:34.094 --> 41:36.363
IT'S WEIRD TO BE
SURROUNDED BY SO MANY RATS.

41:36.396 --> 41:40.100
YOU DON'T GIVE A [bleep]
ABOUT ANYBODY BUT YOURSELF.

41:40.100 --> 41:42.702
YOUR BUILDING
IS COMPLETELY OVERPRICED,

41:42.736 --> 41:43.870
AND YOU ARE SWINDLING PEOPLE

41:43.903 --> 41:46.172
INTO PAYING TOO MUCH MONEY
FOR SOMETHING,

41:46.206 --> 41:48.675
AND I HATE
LOOKING AT YOUR FACE.

41:48.708 --> 41:51.444
JUST TO LET YOU KNOW.

41:51.478 --> 41:54.280
THANKS SO MUCH
FOR YOUR HOSPITALITY.

41:54.314 --> 41:56.483
- I'LL TELL THE RATS
THAT YOU CAME BY.

41:56.516 --> 41:58.785
- BLOW ME.
NO--DON'T, ACTUALLY.

41:58.818 --> 41:59.819
- OOH.

41:59.853 --> 42:02.756
RYAN IS RIDICULOUS,
BUT WHATEVER.

42:02.789 --> 42:04.190
I SOLD ANOTHER UNIT,

42:04.224 --> 42:06.559
AND NOW I'M ONE STEP CLOSER
TO BEING SOLD OUT.

42:06.593 --> 42:07.660
CHING! CHING!

42:07.694 --> 42:10.663
WAAH!
[laughs]

NEXT WEEK ON<i>MILLION DOLLAR</i>
<i>LISTING NEW YORK...</i>

42:13.633 --> 42:15.335
WHOO!

42:15.368 --> 42:16.803
[laughs]
IT'S WEDDING TIME...

42:16.836 --> 42:18.071
WHOO!

42:18.071 --> 42:19.072
AND I'M GOING BIG.

42:19.072 --> 42:20.073
THIS WHOLE THING IS OURS.

42:20.073 --> 42:22.375
I'VE RENTED AN ENTIRE ISLAND.

42:22.409 --> 42:24.678
THIS IS GONNA BE
THE BEST WEEKEND OF MY LIFE.

42:24.711 --> 42:26.079
- TALK TO ME ABOUT BOWERY.

42:26.079 --> 42:28.081
- BUT UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME,
250 BOWERY

42:28.081 --> 42:29.683
DOESN'T TAKE A BREAK
FOR MY WEDDING.

42:29.716 --> 42:31.718
- GO ONLINE
AND GO TO 250 BOWERY.

42:31.751 --> 42:35.488
ARE THERE ANY APARTMENTS
STILL AVAILABLE FOR SALE?

42:35.522 --> 42:37.457
I KNOW THAT FREDRIK
HAS NO ETHICS,

42:37.490 --> 42:38.625
BUT THIS
GOES BEYOND BUSINESS.

42:38.658 --> 42:39.926
[bleep]!

42:39.959 --> 42:41.094
- WOW.
SO FAR SO GOOD.

42:41.127 --> 42:42.762

42:42.796 --> 42:44.898

42:44.931 --> 42:46.332
BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM.

42:46.366 --> 42:48.802
- THIS IS AN OBSTACLE.

42:48.835 --> 42:50.103
- WHERE'S JILL?
WHY ARE YOU AND I

42:50.103 --> 42:51.671
THE ONLY ONES THAT ARE HERE?
- I DON'T KNOW.

42:51.705 --> 42:53.106
- THIS PLACE
IS A TOTAL [bleep]ING MESS!

42:53.106 --> 42:54.874
THIS IS NOT
WHAT I SIGNED UP FOR.

42:54.908 --> 42:56.376
- YOU SHOULD BE
OVER THERE WITH ME.

42:56.409 --> 42:57.711
EVERYONE'S LOOKING FOR YOU...

42:59.446 --> 43:00.547
