00:09.289 --> 00:11.803
There, that's gotta be it.

00:17.249 --> 00:20.446
I don't know. Looks kind of small
to be a mineshaft, doesn't it?

00:20.609 --> 00:23.407
Maybe it was bigger in the 1800s.

00:23.569 --> 00:26.163
X marks the spot. Let's check it out.

00:53.489 --> 00:57.038
- Definitely not a good sign.
- You're such a wimp.

01:01.569 --> 01:03.400
You were saying?

01:07.809 --> 01:11.484
Ten bucks says this is
where the gold is hidden. Hold this.

01:19.409 --> 01:21.161
Ryan, I think these are all
warning signs.

01:21.329 --> 01:23.240
Stop worrying about it.

02:00.889 --> 02:02.766
I'm free.

02:07.729 --> 02:11.005
- What year is this? Speak!
- 1999.

02:12.409 --> 02:14.764
Two hundred years?

02:15.449 --> 02:19.408
- My wand. Where's my wand?
- Your what?

02:19.569 --> 02:21.082
My wand! Where is it?

02:21.249 --> 02:23.319
Don't know
what you're talking about.

02:35.569 --> 02:36.558
Too bad.

02:41.129 --> 02:43.484
- What the hell just happened?
- I don't know.

02:43.649 --> 02:45.241
She shrunk us.

02:45.409 --> 02:48.003
- What do you think she wants?
- How should I know?

02:49.249 --> 02:51.365
- Here she comes.
- I told you this was too dangerous!

02:51.529 --> 02:53.804
Fine, but what are we
gonna do now?

02:53.969 --> 02:57.120
- Oh, no.
- Run!

03:14.569 --> 03:15.922
You're welcome.

03:21.609 --> 03:23.247
Now...

03:23.609 --> 03:25.998
...find my wand.

03:43.849 --> 03:47.000
Phoebe, we are televising this live.
Can't it wait?

03:47.169 --> 03:48.921
Prue, Dan's truck
just pulled up outside.

03:49.369 --> 03:50.722
Dan's truck? So?

03:50.889 --> 03:54.199
So Piper is with him, and they're
kissing. And I'm not just talking about

03:54.369 --> 03:56.519
your thanks-for-lunch
peck-on-the-cheek kind of kiss.

03:56.689 --> 03:58.759
They mean business.

03:59.609 --> 04:03.238
Okay. What is the problem? They
like each other. This is a good thing.

04:03.409 --> 04:05.604
No, I know. I'm just worried
that she's moving too fast.

04:05.769 --> 04:08.329
Like she's too in a hurry to get
involved with someone else.

04:08.489 --> 04:12.528
Look, Piper's a big girl. And really, I
mean, it's none of our business, right?

04:12.689 --> 04:15.522
- Right?
- Isn't it sort of our business?

04:16.129 --> 04:17.801
Okay, Phoebe,

04:18.048 --> 04:21.007
Piper cannot just sit around
for the rest of her life waiting for Leo.

04:21.168 --> 04:22.488
She's trying to move on.

04:23.809 --> 04:27.882
- Besides, Dan's a great guy.
- Okay, we're on in five, Miss Halliwell.

04:28.049 --> 04:30.199
Okay, gotta go. Bye.

04:35.489 --> 04:37.844
It's about freaking time.

04:40.129 --> 04:41.960
Leo, whatever happened
to knocking?

04:42.129 --> 04:45.405
I'm sorry, but there's no time. Where's
Prue and Piper? We have to talk.

04:45.569 --> 04:48.402
You know, now's not really
a good time, okay? I know.

04:48.609 --> 04:50.804
How about you orb back in
in, say, an hour?

04:50.969 --> 04:52.800
- Okay? That would be great, bye-bye.
- I can't.

04:52.969 --> 04:55.119
The worst thing imaginable
just happened.

04:57.449 --> 04:59.201
No kidding.

06:39.769 --> 06:42.237
It's not that it isn't great to see you,
Leo, because it is.

06:42.409 --> 06:44.684
But you can't just orb in
whenever it's convenient.

06:44.849 --> 06:46.965
It hasn't been a problem before.

06:47.129 --> 06:48.926
Yeah. Well, things have changed.

06:49.249 --> 06:50.728
- I can see that.
- Leo.

06:50.889 --> 06:52.880
Sorry. Wasn't fair.

06:53.929 --> 06:55.726
- Where's Prue?
- At work.

06:55.889 --> 06:57.527
Fine, then we'll have to start
without her.

06:57.689 --> 07:01.125
- Your friend Dan has to leave now.
- Oh, really? Why?

07:01.289 --> 07:03.484
Because you and your sisters
have a very big problem.

07:03.649 --> 07:05.401
A magical problem.

07:05.569 --> 07:07.480
Look, this isn't personal.
It's business.

07:07.649 --> 07:09.685
What else is new?

07:10.569 --> 07:14.164
You know, that handyman guy sure
does seem to hang around here a lot.

07:14.329 --> 07:17.366
Well, it's an old house.
Lots of things need fixing.

07:17.529 --> 07:19.281
Then why is Piper so upset?

07:19.449 --> 07:22.441
Because there are some things
that he can't fix

07:22.609 --> 07:24.759
the way she wants it.

07:26.169 --> 07:29.366
You know what, I'm late for a job.
If you can just have her call me later.

07:29.529 --> 07:30.723
Lipstick.

07:30.929 --> 07:32.521
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

07:32.689 --> 07:35.249
- Are, like, Piper and Leo...?
- You're late.

07:36.409 --> 07:38.161
Dan, wait.

07:40.009 --> 07:42.079
Well, I wouldn't know
where to begin anyway.

07:42.249 --> 07:44.444
- Everything okay, sweetie?
- Oh, no.

07:45.729 --> 07:48.004
- Come on, we gotta get going.
- Going? Where are we going?

07:48.169 --> 07:49.238
I'll explain on the way.

07:49.409 --> 07:52.685
No, Leo, you'll explain now.
We're not going anywhere.

07:52.849 --> 07:56.159
Two hundred years ago,
a good witch turned evil,

07:56.329 --> 07:59.002
started using her craft
against innocents.

07:59.169 --> 08:01.808
Fortunately, she was tricked
into a cave and entombed.

08:01.969 --> 08:05.086
But unfortunately, this morning,
Tuatha escaped.

08:05.529 --> 08:06.803
Tuatha?

08:06.969 --> 08:09.005
Who wouldn't go bad
with a name like that?

08:09.169 --> 08:11.763
So you want us to find her
and vanquish her. What's the big deal?

08:11.929 --> 08:15.319
The big deal is you can't vanquish her.
No witch can.

08:15.529 --> 08:17.247
She kills good witches.

08:17.609 --> 08:19.964
Leo, if we can't defeat her,
then who can?

08:20.129 --> 08:22.484
There's only one person.
He's known as the chosen one.

08:22.649 --> 08:25.243
- The chosen one, is he a witch?
- No, he's a normal person,

08:25.409 --> 08:28.287
other than the fact that he was born
to use Tuatha's wand against her.

08:28.809 --> 08:31.164
So, what do you want from us?
Why don't you just go get him?

08:31.329 --> 08:34.684
I need you to protect him from Tuatha
until the wand comes to him.

08:34.849 --> 08:35.918
It shouldn't be long.

08:36.089 --> 08:39.206
Lore has it that once the witch is free,
the wand will find him.

08:39.369 --> 08:41.087
But if she finds it first...

08:41.249 --> 08:44.400
- She'll kill the chosen one.
- And then she'll come after you too.

08:47.769 --> 08:50.442
The design of inlaid garnets
with pewter and ebony

08:50.609 --> 08:52.486
is distinctly 18th-century European.

08:52.649 --> 08:55.368
Eighteenth century?
I had no idea it was that old.

08:55.529 --> 08:58.168
The faceted-cut amber headpiece
surrounded by the symbolic snake

08:58.329 --> 09:01.446
suggests that it was
an ornamental staff or a ritual wand.

09:01.609 --> 09:04.840
And I bought it
at a flea market for 15 dollars.

09:05.289 --> 09:09.885
But you'll be very pleased to hear that
at auction you could easily get $5,000.

09:10.049 --> 09:11.801
Good Lord.

09:11.969 --> 09:14.437
Of course, an item
is only worth as much

09:14.609 --> 09:16.998
as someone is willing to pay for it,
though. Isn't that right?

09:17.169 --> 09:19.319
I'm sorry, who are you?

09:19.489 --> 09:22.606
Jack Sheridan,
from Sheridan Internet Auctions.

09:22.809 --> 09:25.403
If you own it, I can sell it.

09:26.169 --> 09:28.808
Okay. How nice for you.
But this is my appraisal.

09:28.969 --> 09:31.881
Oh, and it's a very impressive one too.

09:32.049 --> 09:35.724
But can you guarantee this nice lady
that someone will actually pay

09:35.889 --> 09:38.357
$5,000 for this at auction?

09:38.529 --> 09:41.487
- There are no guarantees, but...
- Thirty seconds.

09:41.689 --> 09:46.240
Betty, I'm willing to give you
$1,000 cash today.

09:46.409 --> 09:49.242
Yeah, well, then you would be
robbing her of $4,000.

09:49.769 --> 09:52.044
But you said yourself that you
can't guarantee that.

09:52.849 --> 09:56.762
Oh, but I suppose you just have
$1,000 cash in your pocket.

09:57.569 --> 09:59.719
Well, would you like
to find out yourself?

10:00.009 --> 10:03.638
No need. I can tell there's
not much there just by looking.

10:06.849 --> 10:11.286
Betty, I can have $1,000 cash for you
this afternoon. What do you say?

10:11.449 --> 10:12.768
I say sold.

10:14.809 --> 10:16.845
Here's my address.

10:19.529 --> 10:22.680
- And I'll see you there this afternoon.
- It's a deal.

10:22.849 --> 10:25.409
Cut, and that's a wrap.
Excellent, folks.

10:25.569 --> 10:28.129
- Very entertaining.
- Yeah, for you.

10:28.529 --> 10:31.566
Look, forgive me, I just...
I wanted to be on the same stage

10:31.729 --> 10:33.606
- as Prue Halliwell.
- Why?

10:33.769 --> 10:37.364
Because it gives my startup company
instant credibility, that's why.

10:38.009 --> 10:40.477
You know, if the other specialists
at Buckland's

10:40.649 --> 10:43.447
have your expertise and talents,

10:43.609 --> 10:46.043
I might reconsider
their standing job offer.

10:46.209 --> 10:47.927
I turned them down last year.

10:48.089 --> 10:51.798
You wouldn't like it here, Mr Sheridan.
We don't lie or cheat.

10:52.089 --> 10:53.363
I don't lie.

10:54.449 --> 10:57.327
You know what, l...
I better get to the bank.

10:57.489 --> 10:59.525
I have a wand to buy.

11:01.929 --> 11:03.920
Wanna bet?

11:13.529 --> 11:16.726
I don't know. An evil witch who gets
her jollies killing good witches?

11:16.889 --> 11:19.483
Maybe we should have waited
for Prue to get home.

11:19.649 --> 11:21.765
- There's no time.
- Okay, please tell me we're here

11:21.929 --> 11:24.159
because the chosen one is a big,
burly football coach.

11:24.329 --> 11:27.605
No. But he is the seventh son
of the seventh son.

11:28.209 --> 11:30.200
We've been watching him
since he was a young boy.

11:30.369 --> 11:32.405
Okay, so how old is he now?

11:32.569 --> 11:36.448
- See, over there.
- He's a high school student?

11:36.609 --> 11:39.601
- And he's a nerd.
- Hey, I didn't choose him, they did.

11:39.809 --> 11:41.686
If he can help save you,
that's all I care about.

11:41.849 --> 11:44.921
Leo, he's a teenager. How can we
let him go up against Tuatha?

11:45.089 --> 11:46.238
She'll destroy him.

11:46.409 --> 11:48.764
Not if he finds the wand
and learns how to use it.

11:48.929 --> 11:50.999
Besides, she knows
he's the chosen one.

11:51.169 --> 11:53.967
If we don't help him, she'll find him
and destroy him anyway.

11:55.209 --> 11:56.881
Doesn't sound like
we have much of a choice.

11:57.369 --> 12:00.964
This is wrong. He should be battling
acne at his age, not evil witches.

12:01.129 --> 12:03.040
Yeah, but look at us.
Do we look like we should be

12:03.209 --> 12:05.359
the all-powerful Charmed Ones?

12:05.529 --> 12:09.522
- What's his name?
- Kyle. Kyle Gwydion.

12:09.689 --> 12:11.600
- Does he know yet?
- No.

12:11.769 --> 12:14.602
Any idea on how we're supposed to
get him to come with us?

12:14.769 --> 12:19.320
I have an idea. He likes magic, right?
Let's show him ours.

12:20.969 --> 12:23.563
- Hey. It's Kyle, right?
- Do I know you?

12:23.729 --> 12:26.243
Not yet, but you will.
You'll know the both of us.

12:26.409 --> 12:29.207
I think you might have me confused
with somebody else.

12:29.369 --> 12:31.564
- Nope, you're the one.
- The chosen one.

12:31.729 --> 12:32.957
That was real subtle.

12:33.129 --> 12:35.689
You heard what Leo said,
clock's a-ticking. Hey, Kyle,

12:35.849 --> 12:38.761
do you believe in magic?
Real magic?

12:39.209 --> 12:41.006
I gotta go.

12:41.169 --> 12:43.922
Piper, we have to show him
before someone sees.

12:44.289 --> 12:45.722
Kyle.

12:47.689 --> 12:50.249
- Now what?
- You wait here.

12:55.049 --> 12:56.801
Behind you.

12:59.529 --> 13:01.724
- How did you do that?
- Magic.

13:01.889 --> 13:03.925
Wanna know more?

13:33.769 --> 13:35.760
Help me, somebody.

13:36.689 --> 13:38.759
Help me!

13:45.689 --> 13:47.600
Well done.

13:48.889 --> 13:50.527
That's my wand.

13:51.489 --> 13:54.003
My God! Who are you?

13:54.169 --> 13:57.320
The last being you will ever see.

13:59.249 --> 14:00.841
Betty.

14:25.089 --> 14:28.479
No. It's all right.

14:28.769 --> 14:31.408
We don't have to follow her.

14:31.929 --> 14:36.764
She's a good witch.
She'll come back to us.

14:48.609 --> 14:52.807
- So you're witches.
- Right.

14:52.969 --> 14:57.281
- And I'm the chosen one.
- Correct.

14:57.449 --> 15:01.283
And why exactly am I
the chosen one again?

15:01.449 --> 15:03.440
Because you're the only one
who can defeat Tuatha.

15:03.609 --> 15:04.598
Leo, please.

15:04.769 --> 15:06.521
I'm sorry, we don't have
a lot of time here.

15:06.689 --> 15:09.078
All the more reason
not to freak Kyle out.

15:09.249 --> 15:11.160
Too late.

15:14.049 --> 15:17.041
Look, Kyle, I know that
this is a lot for you to take in.

15:17.209 --> 15:20.121
And your first instinct
is probably to resist it.

15:20.289 --> 15:23.725
I mean, I know that's how we felt when
we first found out we were witches.

15:23.889 --> 15:25.083
Still do sometimes.

15:25.249 --> 15:27.968
But we've learned that you
cannot fight your destiny.

15:28.129 --> 15:31.166
It's like fighting who you are,
who you're meant to be.

15:31.329 --> 15:34.958
And your destiny is to vanquish
the evil witch Tuatha.

15:36.929 --> 15:39.921
I bet one of my brothers
put you up to this. Right?

15:40.089 --> 15:41.920
What, Sean?

15:42.089 --> 15:45.001
No, no, I bet... I bet it was lan.
Or Dylan?

15:45.169 --> 15:47.125
I'm always the butt of their jokes.

15:47.289 --> 15:50.486
- Kyle, listen...
- No, you... You listen.

15:51.009 --> 15:52.965
This is a joke.

15:53.729 --> 15:55.924
I'm not the chosen one.

15:56.569 --> 15:58.287
I'm no one.

16:00.049 --> 16:02.244
You made a mistake.

16:03.009 --> 16:04.965
- Kyle, wait.
- What do we do? What do we do?

16:05.129 --> 16:06.244
Stop him.

16:09.209 --> 16:11.677
- Whoa, who are you?
- Nobody.

16:12.929 --> 16:14.760
- It glowed.
- That's the wand.

16:14.929 --> 16:16.681
It has to be, it recognizes you, Kyle.

16:16.849 --> 16:19.488
- Recognizes? What do you mean?
- Where did you get that?

16:19.809 --> 16:22.448
From someone that I think that
I should tell you about in private.

16:22.609 --> 16:25.123
- Someone named Tuatha?
- Tuatha?

16:26.169 --> 16:28.399
Let Kyle hold the wand.

16:35.289 --> 16:37.325
Go ahead, it won't hurt you.

16:48.409 --> 16:51.048
It found you,
just like it's supposed to.

16:51.209 --> 16:52.642
Okay, time out. Attic, anyone?

16:53.329 --> 16:54.967
Kyle, why don't you go
into the kitchen

16:55.129 --> 16:56.687
and help yourself
to whatever you want.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.966
- That is, if you're staying.
- I'm staying.

17:00.129 --> 17:02.438
I don't know for how long, though.

17:05.729 --> 17:07.606
I'll be right back.

17:09.209 --> 17:13.248
Leo, he's just a kid. Besides,
you haven't seen Tuatha's power.

17:13.409 --> 17:15.718
I mean, she made
a woman disappear, literally.

17:15.888 --> 17:17.880
It's his destiny
to defeat Tuatha, Prue.

17:18.169 --> 17:21.241
- Then why did I get the wand?
- To make sure it got to him.

17:21.529 --> 17:24.202
It's part of the lore. If you guys
were meant to defeat Tuatha,

17:24.368 --> 17:26.803
there would be a spell in
the Book of Shadows, and there isn't.

17:26.969 --> 17:29.244
- He's right. We checked.
- Twice.

17:29.409 --> 17:31.764
Which means we need to spend
what little time we have left

17:31.929 --> 17:33.362
teaching Kyle how to use the wand.

17:33.729 --> 17:36.960
Look, Leo, I know that you never
guided us down the wrong path before.

17:37.129 --> 17:40.326
But please, at least let us
try to defeat Tuatha.

17:40.489 --> 17:42.844
If we fail, then fine,
we'll help you with Kyle.

17:43.089 --> 17:44.283
She'll kill you.

17:44.929 --> 17:46.885
Don't bet on it.

17:47.169 --> 17:52.562
All right, we need to start by finding out
where Tuatha is before she finds us.

17:55.849 --> 17:59.444
- Piper, are you with us?
- Yep.

18:07.729 --> 18:09.640
Hey, it's me.

18:10.729 --> 18:12.720
- Hi.
- Who are you?

18:13.689 --> 18:16.601
Apparently, I'm the chosen one.

18:18.089 --> 18:21.604
I haven't seen you around before.
What's your name?

18:22.569 --> 18:24.321
- Kyle.
- Jenny.

18:24.489 --> 18:25.922
- You a friend of theirs?
- No.

18:26.089 --> 18:30.560
No, I'm just supposed to help them
with something. Maybe.

18:30.729 --> 18:33.527
- I don't know.
- Well, what's that?

18:35.689 --> 18:38.806
- It's magic.
- I don't believe in magic.

18:39.529 --> 18:42.043
You're kidding.
Everybody believes in magic.

18:42.249 --> 18:43.284
Not me.

19:07.729 --> 19:10.323
That is so cool.
How are you doing that?

19:10.969 --> 19:13.199
I have no idea.

19:15.209 --> 19:17.439
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

19:18.009 --> 19:19.681
I was just...

19:19.849 --> 19:21.885
Telling your friend goodbye?

19:22.049 --> 19:23.038
Fine, I can take a hint.

19:23.209 --> 19:25.962
Just tell Piper that my uncle Dan
needs to talk to her, okay?

19:26.129 --> 19:27.926
- Sure.
- Bye.

19:28.969 --> 19:30.084
Bye.

19:30.249 --> 19:32.809
So still think you're not
the chosen one?

19:43.089 --> 19:45.000
There you are.

19:57.369 --> 20:00.520
"To disempower a witch.

20:00.689 --> 20:03.408
Fresh human heart."

20:09.329 --> 20:12.401
- Here it is. A scrying spell.
- Scrying? What's that?

20:12.569 --> 20:15.527
It's what witches use to magically find
something or someone.

20:15.689 --> 20:20.285
It says that we need a map,
a piece of string and a crystal.

20:20.769 --> 20:21.804
Okay.

20:24.009 --> 20:27.240
Day three. I'm definitely lost
in the woods.

20:27.409 --> 20:29.639
Separated from the other two.

20:29.809 --> 20:31.879
Running out of food,

20:32.049 --> 20:33.687
water.

20:33.849 --> 20:35.521
Little scared.

20:35.689 --> 20:38.601
- Sorry, did I scare you?
- Hell, yeah, you did.

20:38.769 --> 20:39.804
Are you lost?

20:39.969 --> 20:42.802
Yeah, totally. Just walking
around in circles.

20:42.969 --> 20:46.439
Couple of friends and me were making
a documentary on the Blair Witch.

20:55.729 --> 20:58.402
Did you know that it takes
15 to 20 seconds

20:58.569 --> 21:01.606
for a person to die after their heart
has been damaged?

21:01.889 --> 21:03.925
And since that time's almost up,

21:04.089 --> 21:08.002
from the bottom of my heart,
I thank you for yours.

21:31.689 --> 21:35.398
Okay, we found her.
Lost Caves, Muir Woods.

21:45.689 --> 21:46.758
Yeah, l...

21:46.929 --> 21:49.045
I can't make it do it again.

21:50.689 --> 21:53.408
- You did it before.
- I don't know how.

21:53.569 --> 21:56.208
I mean, I was just trying
to impress Jenny, that's all.

21:56.489 --> 22:00.243
Well, that's how. It came from
your heart, from inside of you.

22:00.409 --> 22:01.842
- You willed it.
- So what?

22:02.009 --> 22:06.082
So I'm supposed to will
some evil witch dead?

22:06.409 --> 22:09.685
But why me? You know,
I don't understand, out of all people...

22:09.849 --> 22:13.319
Don't sell yourself short, Kyle.
You saw what you did before.

22:13.489 --> 22:15.286
Now, that was you.

22:15.609 --> 22:18.282
All you have to do
is believe in yourself.

22:19.569 --> 22:21.685
Now, try it again.

22:28.409 --> 22:30.047
Leo, we found her.

22:30.209 --> 22:32.006
So we're gonna go pay her
a little visit.

22:32.169 --> 22:33.682
No, wait, don't. Please.

22:34.369 --> 22:37.122
It's nothing personal, Leo,
it's just business.

22:47.809 --> 22:49.401
You.

22:49.569 --> 22:53.767
Thrilled to see me, I see.
This is a really nice house, Prue.

22:53.929 --> 22:56.284
Buckland's obviously pays
better than I thought.

22:56.449 --> 22:58.167
What do you want,
and how did you find me?

22:58.329 --> 23:02.527
I followed your scent.
Must de Cartier, right?

23:02.689 --> 23:05.965
Now, that is a classy perfume.
Though I'm hardly surprised.

23:06.129 --> 23:08.359
Could I have my wand back, please?

23:08.529 --> 23:10.804
You see, Betty never called,
and I couldn't contact her,

23:10.969 --> 23:13.961
because her address mysteriously
fell out of my pocket somehow.

23:14.129 --> 23:16.006
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

23:16.169 --> 23:19.206
So you're blaming me
for something that you lost.

23:19.369 --> 23:21.360
Isn't that a little juvenile?
I mean, what's next,

23:21.529 --> 23:24.566
a shoving match on the jungle gym,
a war over juice cups?

23:24.729 --> 23:26.879
Prue, we really need to get going.

23:27.049 --> 23:29.165
The wand is mine, Prue,
and you know it.

23:29.329 --> 23:30.808
All's fair in love and war.

23:32.129 --> 23:33.118
Piper.

23:33.289 --> 23:35.678
- Hi, Dan.
- Piper, wait...

23:36.449 --> 23:39.600
- Is he still here?
- Never left, actually.

23:39.769 --> 23:43.239
Prue, I'm kind of in a hurry here,
so if I could just get my wand and...

23:43.409 --> 23:45.798
All right, you know what?
Dan, Piper will call you back later.

23:45.969 --> 23:47.482
You, whoever you are,
sorry, no wand.

23:47.649 --> 23:49.287
Leo, keep working with Kyle,
just in case.

23:49.449 --> 23:52.122
Us, out the back door.
Out the back door.

23:57.249 --> 23:59.604
Don't you have
some other house to repair?

23:59.769 --> 24:00.884
No.

24:05.489 --> 24:07.957
We should be getting close.

24:09.449 --> 24:11.360
Hey, there it is.

24:16.369 --> 24:18.883
Kind of creepy in there. And dark.

24:19.049 --> 24:21.358
All right, I'll go in first,
since she only knows about me.

24:21.529 --> 24:24.726
You guys just wait a couple
of seconds, then follow.

24:47.449 --> 24:49.917
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

25:12.729 --> 25:15.289
Thank you for not
keeping me waiting long.

25:15.449 --> 25:17.201
- How did you know that...?
- Neophyte witches

25:17.369 --> 25:18.722
are always so predictable.

25:20.569 --> 25:23.720
Like I said, I cast a spell,
removed your powers.

25:23.889 --> 25:26.005
Obviously, you didn't
count on that, witch.

25:26.369 --> 25:29.042
And obviously, you didn't
count on her sister witches.

25:34.449 --> 25:35.643
Are you guys okay?

25:35.809 --> 25:39.404
Three witches.
I'll be ready for that next time.

25:41.849 --> 25:43.362
Cool.

25:44.529 --> 25:46.520
Well, it was.

25:56.169 --> 25:58.205
Both hands. All right,
you have to use both hands.

25:58.369 --> 26:00.360
I didn't need both hands
when I made it spin before.

26:00.529 --> 26:02.326
Well, you'll need both hands
against Tuatha.

26:02.569 --> 26:04.719
If she gets the wand from you,
she becomes invincible,

26:04.889 --> 26:06.925
and you will not
be able to vanquish her.

26:07.089 --> 26:10.684
Now, just do as I say.
Pretend I'm evil, all right?

26:10.849 --> 26:13.682
You connect to your destiny
by connecting to yourself.

26:13.849 --> 26:15.840
Will me away.

26:28.169 --> 26:30.285
Look, give it up, Obi-Wan, all right?

26:30.449 --> 26:32.440
- You got the wrong guy.
- No, I don't.

26:32.609 --> 26:34.600
All right, you are not just
the seventh son.

26:34.769 --> 26:37.522
You are the seventh generation
of chosen ones.

26:37.689 --> 26:40.999
It's in your blood.
You just have to believe.

26:41.289 --> 26:43.200
Believe in what?

26:43.369 --> 26:45.439
What, myself?

26:46.249 --> 26:47.807
Forget it.

26:47.969 --> 26:50.244
- Look, you can't just give up.
- Just did.

26:50.409 --> 26:54.004
Innocent people are going to die.
Are you willing to live with that?

26:54.169 --> 26:56.125
No, now, don't you
lay that crap on me!

26:56.289 --> 26:58.405
Oh, does that make you mad?

26:59.369 --> 27:02.805
Good. At least that means
finally you're being the real you.

27:02.969 --> 27:04.084
Screw you.

27:04.249 --> 27:06.205
That's right, get pissed at me.
Show me your anger.

27:06.369 --> 27:08.485
Maybe you'll figure out
what you're really angry about.

27:08.649 --> 27:11.243
You don't think you're the chosen one,
you think you're forgotten.

27:11.409 --> 27:13.400
Sick and tired of it too, aren't you?
Aren't you?

27:19.729 --> 27:21.208
Leo?

27:29.209 --> 27:30.961
Not bad.

27:31.609 --> 27:33.645
What was that crash?

27:34.449 --> 27:37.247
- What happened in here?
- Little training, that's all.

27:37.409 --> 27:40.321
"That's all"? Do you have any idea
how much that's gonna cost to fix?

27:40.489 --> 27:43.925
Well, I know who's gonna be fixing it.
Leo, what if somebody saw you?

27:44.089 --> 27:45.488
Oh, someone like neighbour Dan?

27:46.969 --> 27:49.881
- Hey, you're bleeding.
- It's nothing.

27:50.249 --> 27:53.525
- So you guys kick some butt or what?
- Or what.

27:53.689 --> 27:56.283
Tuatha was ready for us,
or at least for me.

27:56.449 --> 27:58.007
She stripped away my power.

27:58.249 --> 28:01.082
And then literally disappeared
before I had the chance to freeze her.

28:02.009 --> 28:04.125
It's a good thing she wasn't
expecting all three of us,

28:04.289 --> 28:05.847
or we wouldn't have
gotten out of there.

28:06.169 --> 28:09.206
You're lucky you did.
Now, will you help me with Kyle?

28:09.369 --> 28:11.678
Why are you so ready to send
a teenager up against an evil

28:11.849 --> 28:14.283
- that we can't even defeat?
- Because he can.

28:14.449 --> 28:16.758
At least, he can with the wand.

28:16.929 --> 28:18.806
And he's getting better at it too.

28:18.969 --> 28:20.448
I'm out of here.

28:20.609 --> 28:21.678
- Kyle, wait.
- No.

28:21.889 --> 28:25.882
What the hell is the matter with you?
They're even scared of her.

28:26.049 --> 28:30.645
I told you, you have made
a huge mistake. I can't do this.

28:38.689 --> 28:41.761
Leo, you can't make him.
Even if it is his destiny.

28:41.929 --> 28:43.920
I hope he doesn't tell anyone
we're witches.

28:44.089 --> 28:45.807
Won't matter much if we're dead.

28:45.969 --> 28:48.085
Okay, nobody knows
the Book of Shadows better than you.

28:48.249 --> 28:50.558
So if black magic
can strip away powers,

28:50.729 --> 28:53.880
then surely white magic
can do the same, right? Let's go.

29:03.649 --> 29:05.958
Joshua!

29:06.649 --> 29:10.119
- I'm telling you, Heath, he's dead.
- He's not dead, Michael.

29:10.289 --> 29:12.564
Joshua!

29:14.489 --> 29:16.081
Hey.

29:16.449 --> 29:18.007
Looking for the Blair Witch?

29:24.729 --> 29:30.486
Before the passing of this hour
Take away all of their powers

29:39.569 --> 29:41.685
Find my wand.

29:58.849 --> 30:01.204
Want me to heal that for you?

30:02.249 --> 30:04.285
- I'm fine.
- Come on.

30:04.449 --> 30:05.518
No.

30:05.689 --> 30:10.968
It just gets all confusing when
we're close and when you touch me.

30:11.129 --> 30:13.723
I don't wanna be confused anymore.

30:13.889 --> 30:15.242
Hey.

30:15.849 --> 30:19.728
Look, Leo, you just do your job,
and I'll do mine, okay?

30:23.129 --> 30:25.723
This is my job, Piper.

30:41.649 --> 30:43.401
Thanks.

30:44.489 --> 30:46.241
He'll never understand you,
you know.

30:46.409 --> 30:48.843
Your secret, what you're all about.

30:50.049 --> 30:52.324
Not like I can.

30:56.929 --> 30:58.521
Maybe not.

30:58.689 --> 31:02.238
But at least I can count on him
to be there for me when I need him.

31:15.129 --> 31:17.848
- Kyle! Uncle Dan, stop.
- Who's he?

31:18.009 --> 31:20.204
Just some friend of Piper's.
He's cool.

31:20.369 --> 31:22.121
- I'll be home soon.
- Soon when?

31:22.289 --> 31:24.041
- An hour?
- School night.

31:24.449 --> 31:26.326
Half an hour.

31:27.089 --> 31:28.363
Hey.

31:28.529 --> 31:30.042
Where you going?

31:30.209 --> 31:32.120
Just out of here.

31:32.289 --> 31:34.883
- Where's your magic wand?
- It's not mine.

31:35.049 --> 31:38.280
- Never was.
- Sure could have fooled me.

31:38.449 --> 31:40.440
Are you okay?

31:42.329 --> 31:44.047
How long have you known
the Halliwells?

31:44.209 --> 31:46.325
Couple months. Why?

31:46.569 --> 31:51.120
They have this screwed-up idea
that I'm...

31:51.969 --> 31:54.642
Well, that I'm somebody that I'm not.

31:55.129 --> 31:57.120
Never mind. It doesn't matter.

31:57.289 --> 31:59.928
Phoebe once told me
that if it matters to you, it matters.

32:00.289 --> 32:03.281
So if they think you're somebody,
Kyle, then you probably are.

32:08.129 --> 32:09.801
Thanks.

32:42.929 --> 32:44.521
Piper?

32:45.249 --> 32:46.568
Any luck?

32:46.729 --> 32:49.562
Well, I did find one spell,
but it requires a human heart,

32:49.729 --> 32:51.720
and unfortunately,
we're all still using ours.

32:52.049 --> 32:54.768
Well, take mine. All it does
is get me in trouble anyway.

32:56.409 --> 32:58.969
- Snake.
- Oh, I'm the snake?

32:59.129 --> 33:00.881
- But you're the one who...
- Snake!

33:17.409 --> 33:18.967
Look out!

33:21.089 --> 33:24.206
- Tuatha... Okay, Piper, freeze him.
- I'm trying. It's not working.

33:25.129 --> 33:27.279
Prue! Prue.

33:27.449 --> 33:29.519
Prue. What should we do?

33:31.489 --> 33:33.878
- Kyle.
- Leo, do something.

33:35.409 --> 33:37.969
Kyle, catch.

33:43.169 --> 33:45.125
Die!

33:54.809 --> 33:55.798
Thanks.

34:12.089 --> 34:14.159
Okay, this is a potion
to induce sleep.

34:14.329 --> 34:18.117
This one is to repel an evil threat.
And that one puts out a fire.

34:18.289 --> 34:22.202
- What kind of potion does that?
- None. It's water.

34:22.409 --> 34:25.639
I didn't have a lot of time. It was
the best that I could do, okay?

34:26.129 --> 34:28.563
What about the potion
to give Kyle more courage?

34:28.728 --> 34:30.321
I remembered wrong.
There isn't one.

34:31.089 --> 34:34.239
- Well, that's disappointing.
- You guys, I'm scared.

34:34.409 --> 34:37.719
And not just for him, but for us.

34:37.889 --> 34:39.925
I don't like feeling so powerless.

34:40.208 --> 34:44.088
Maybe that's our lesson for the day,
not taking our powers for granted.

34:44.529 --> 34:46.804
Maybe. But if we're gonna
get our powers back,

34:46.969 --> 34:49.164
then we're gonna have to help Kyle
defeat Tuatha.

34:49.329 --> 34:51.364
Well, we're just gonna
have to find a way

34:51.529 --> 34:54.839
to make Kyle feel more courageous
without magic, that's all.

34:55.009 --> 34:56.681
Come on.

34:59.609 --> 35:01.201
- How's it going?
- Good.

35:01.369 --> 35:03.405
- I think he's ready.
- You think?

35:03.569 --> 35:05.241
I'm ready.

35:05.409 --> 35:07.764
I mean, as ready
as I can be, anyway.

35:08.089 --> 35:12.128
You know, it's funny, I always
wanted to be somebody special.

35:12.289 --> 35:14.405
You should be careful
what you wish for.

35:14.569 --> 35:16.161
Believe me, we can relate.

35:20.009 --> 35:22.398
Phoebe, the sleeping potion.

35:28.209 --> 35:31.519
So young. So new to the craft.

35:31.689 --> 35:33.566
Now, this is a sleeping potion.

35:44.289 --> 35:45.608
Hey! What the...?

35:45.809 --> 35:48.767
Now, the wand, if you please.

35:53.049 --> 35:55.165
Not much of a chosen one, are you?

35:55.329 --> 35:57.797
At least the last one
was able to entomb me.

35:57.969 --> 35:59.721
Like I will now entomb you.

35:59.889 --> 36:01.561
Prue, the courage potion.

36:05.689 --> 36:09.762
- What? There is no courage potion.
- No? Now who's teaching who?

36:10.809 --> 36:12.800
Kyle, get the wand. You can do it.

36:16.929 --> 36:18.999
I wish for the wand.

36:21.609 --> 36:23.884
My wand!

36:32.849 --> 36:35.443
Don't give up, Kyle. Believe.

36:57.609 --> 37:01.727
- I wish you gone forever!
- No!

37:13.249 --> 37:14.568
Leo.

37:19.809 --> 37:23.006
- You're hurt.
- I'm okay.

37:30.889 --> 37:33.722
- Let me get you some ice.
- Really, I'm fine.

37:34.329 --> 37:37.127
- Are you getting even?
- No.

37:37.969 --> 37:39.527
Just finally getting it.

37:39.969 --> 37:41.880
What you want.

37:42.689 --> 37:44.645
What you deserve.

37:46.049 --> 37:48.722
A normal life...

37:49.969 --> 37:52.767
...or at least as normal of a life
as you can get.

37:53.969 --> 37:56.642
Which means a normal relationship.

37:56.809 --> 37:58.322
Which I can't give you.

38:03.089 --> 38:05.000
Guess we know now why witches
and whitelighters

38:05.169 --> 38:07.637
aren't supposed to fall in love, huh?

38:21.729 --> 38:24.641
- It's broken.
- It served its purpose.

38:24.809 --> 38:26.401
Yeah.

38:26.609 --> 38:29.919
Thanks to your magical boost
of courage.

38:30.089 --> 38:33.161
Kyle, Tuatha was right.

38:33.329 --> 38:35.889
There was no courage potion,
we made it up.

38:36.049 --> 38:38.643
You defeated her all by yourself.

38:38.969 --> 38:41.278
Well, still, it doesn't...

38:41.449 --> 38:43.644
Doesn't change anything.

38:43.809 --> 38:46.323
Nobody would believe me
even if I told them what I did.

38:46.609 --> 38:48.884
Yeah, but you know what you did.

38:49.049 --> 38:50.721
And as long as you keep
believing in that,

38:50.889 --> 38:53.005
you can change whatever you want.

38:54.369 --> 38:56.280
Who knows what
you're still destined for.

39:04.809 --> 39:07.369
What are you gonna tell him about
what happened to the poor lady

39:07.529 --> 39:10.999
- who owned the wand?
- Well, what can I tell him?

39:11.169 --> 39:14.127
Look, I called him because I just
wanna get rid of this thing, that's all.

39:14.289 --> 39:16.803
Are you sure it's not just an excuse
to see him again?

39:16.969 --> 39:20.120
Phoebe, don't be ridiculous.
This is business, it's not personal.

39:20.289 --> 39:23.087
Where have I heard that before?

39:23.889 --> 39:25.242
Got a date, gotta go.

39:25.409 --> 39:28.685
Well, for what it's worth,
I think Jack is pretty cute.

39:28.849 --> 39:30.726
Yeah, well, he's a jerk.
How do I look?

39:30.889 --> 39:33.357
- Fab.
- Thanks.

39:34.209 --> 39:37.281
Hey. I just thought that you
might wanna have this back.

39:37.449 --> 39:40.327
I mean, after all,
it is rightfully yours. Okay.

39:40.489 --> 39:42.320
Hold it.

39:42.849 --> 39:44.965
What's wrong with this picture?

39:45.129 --> 39:46.528
Looks like it broke.

39:47.089 --> 39:48.761
Keen eye, Prue.

39:48.929 --> 39:51.204
It kind of lowers the value
of the wand, don't you think?

39:51.689 --> 39:54.601
Bright side, at least it's worth
what you were gonna buy it for now.

39:58.009 --> 39:59.601
Come on. Have a drink.

39:59.769 --> 40:02.727
You can brag to me how you
outsmarted me with the wand.

40:04.569 --> 40:07.037
I do like to learn from the best.

40:08.009 --> 40:10.443
Okay, I'll brag a little.

40:12.649 --> 40:14.401
Bartender.

40:18.129 --> 40:19.881
- Right this way, sir.
- Thanks.

40:20.049 --> 40:21.323
You're welcome.

40:22.089 --> 40:24.045
- Hi.
- Hi.

40:25.289 --> 40:26.961
After you.

40:28.449 --> 40:31.725
Thanks for coming. I hope a late,
late dinner is okay with you.

40:31.889 --> 40:34.244
Look, I'm gonna make this
easy for you.

40:34.849 --> 40:37.488
I know that you
and that handyman, Leon...

40:37.649 --> 40:40.288
- Leo.
- Right, Leo.

40:41.689 --> 40:43.600
I know that you guys
are more than just friends.

40:45.129 --> 40:48.326
I'm not dumb. I mean,
he's always around the house...

40:48.489 --> 40:51.481
Dan, it's over.

40:54.729 --> 40:57.527
Oh, no, I don't mean you and me,
I meant him and me.

40:57.689 --> 40:59.202
That's why I wanted
to see you tonight.

40:59.369 --> 41:02.008
I didn't want there to be
any more confusion.

41:03.489 --> 41:05.161
You sure?

41:05.329 --> 41:07.001
Yeah, I'm sure.
