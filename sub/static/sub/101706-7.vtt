Street and go.

19:40.353 --> 19:42.398
Sir, he's got to know
that we can ID him now.

19:42.442 --> 19:43.660
He's either gonna disappear...

19:43.704 --> 19:45.488
Or accelerate his attacks.

19:45.532 --> 19:47.273
I'll talk to
Emergency Management,

19:47.316 --> 19:49.275
have Station 127 stand down.

19:49.318 --> 19:51.625
Now, we can invite Captain
Hauser and his men into SWAT

19:51.668 --> 19:53.670
for protection, assuming
you have no objection.

19:53.714 --> 19:55.803
Not at all.The more the merrier.All right.

19:59.589 --> 20:02.418
MARY:
It's a little bit of an
oversimplification maybe.

20:02.462 --> 20:03.941
People handle
grief differently.

20:03.985 --> 20:06.901
We don't all progress
the same way, at the same rate.

20:06.944 --> 20:09.512
I'm guessing Adam Max
would be an example of that?

20:09.556 --> 20:11.253
Adam.

20:11.297 --> 20:15.344
Adam was stuck in
the anger phase, intensely.

20:15.388 --> 20:16.737
Are you still working with him?No.

20:16.780 --> 20:18.913
I had to ask Adam
to stop coming around.

20:18.956 --> 20:22.525
He was a detriment to the others
in group session.

20:22.569 --> 20:25.049
Yeah, denied them
an opportunity to heal.

20:25.093 --> 20:26.355
How do you mean?

20:26.399 --> 20:28.052
Well, he would
monopolize the time,

20:28.096 --> 20:29.532
ranting endlessly,

20:29.576 --> 20:31.578
blaming the firemen
for his family's death.

20:32.622 --> 20:35.538
Look, I can't imagine the horror
of what Adam went through.

20:35.582 --> 20:38.541
I mean, coming home
to find his building on fire,

20:38.585 --> 20:42.502
the firemen retreating
with his family still inside.

20:42.545 --> 20:44.286
I see a lot of pain here.

20:44.330 --> 20:47.898
What Adam was dealing with
was much deeper, much darker.

20:47.942 --> 20:49.944
And I can only assume
since leaving

20:49.987 --> 20:52.076
that he's gotten much worse.Ms. Coffey,

20:52.120 --> 20:53.556
it is very important
that we find Adam

20:53.600 --> 20:54.557
as quickly as possible.

20:54.601 --> 20:55.689
Any idea how we do that?

20:55.732 --> 20:57.386
Any clue
where he might be living?No.

20:57.430 --> 20:58.822
I just assumed
he was living in that RV.

20:58.866 --> 20:59.997
He had an RV?MARY:
Yeah.

21:00.041 --> 21:01.477
I mean, I walked him out
to the parking lot

21:01.521 --> 21:03.392
a few times, mostly just
to get him out of the building.

21:03.436 --> 21:05.786
It was clear that he was
living out of that thing.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.572
[line ringing]

21:11.966 --> 21:13.533
Hey, Tan the man.

21:13.576 --> 21:14.838
Hey, Luca.

21:14.882 --> 21:15.926
What's up?
You know I always love

21:15.970 --> 21:17.058
seeing your face,

21:17.101 --> 21:18.407
but I got some local PDs

21:18.451 --> 21:20.104
about to drag me out
to the brat house.

21:20.148 --> 21:22.019
Yeah, all right.
Yeah, some other time, maybe.

21:22.063 --> 21:23.499
No, hey.

21:23.543 --> 21:25.414
Uh, I got a second or two.
What's up?

21:25.458 --> 21:27.634
It's about
the T.L.I. competition.

21:27.677 --> 21:29.331
Oh, dude.

21:29.375 --> 21:31.551
You know I have no say in who's
gonna be my partner out here.

21:31.594 --> 21:33.030
That's all Hicks's call.I know.

21:33.074 --> 21:34.815
It's just, man, I-I feel like

21:34.858 --> 21:36.904
I've been kicking ass on SWAT
for a long time now.

21:36.947 --> 21:38.645
Is Hicks
really gonna make his pick

21:38.688 --> 21:39.863
based on
these last couple weeks?

21:39.907 --> 21:41.561
On some stupid competition?

21:41.604 --> 21:43.432
Well, yeah. I mean, that's kind
of the point of the whole thing.

21:43.476 --> 21:46.435
Look, I already talked to Hondo,so I know what's up.

21:46.479 --> 21:47.958
You're not out of it yet, okay?

21:48.002 --> 21:50.483
You just got to make your mark
in the time you got left,

21:50.526 --> 21:51.919
that's all.[man shouting]

21:51.962 --> 21:53.442
[horn honks]Hey, sorry, man.

21:53.486 --> 21:55.444
My German brudersare here,
so I got to go.

21:55.488 --> 21:59.100
Just put yourself out there
and get yourself noticed, okay?

21:59.143 --> 22:00.841
All right, good luck, bro. Tschuüss.

22:04.671 --> 22:06.673
[indistinct chatter]

22:08.936 --> 22:10.981
CHRIS:
So, what you think?

22:11.025 --> 22:13.027
Your first taste
of Guate-Mama's. Amazing, right?

22:13.070 --> 22:15.551
You guys are blowing my mind
right now.

22:15.595 --> 22:17.988
This is from your food truck?
You own it?

22:18.032 --> 22:20.121
20-Squad does, yeah.
All partners.

22:20.164 --> 22:22.166
COLLINS:
Talk at the fire
station's always been

22:22.210 --> 22:23.994
that firemen have the best food.
I mean, cops...

22:24.038 --> 22:25.648
[chuckles]:
You know, they don't...ERIKA: Let me guess.

22:25.692 --> 22:27.998
We're just
the coffee and doughnut clowns?Don't worry

22:28.042 --> 22:29.913
about it. We know how much smack
you talk about us.

22:29.957 --> 22:31.785
Plus, we give as good as we get.Oh, do you?
[chuckles]

22:31.828 --> 22:33.090
[laughs]

22:37.225 --> 22:40.141
Sergeant David Kay. I need you
over here front and center.

22:40.184 --> 22:42.404
Come on, man.What's this about?

22:42.448 --> 22:43.666
No idea, I swear.BRADLEY:
All right, everybody.

22:43.710 --> 22:45.407
Listen up.
I got something to say.

22:45.451 --> 22:46.626
Just got word
from a nurse friend

22:46.669 --> 22:47.931
over at Holy Cross.

22:47.975 --> 22:50.847
Kyle Cooper is out of surgery.
He's doing well.

22:50.891 --> 22:52.762
Yeah!BRADLEY:
Doctors expect him to make

22:52.806 --> 22:54.024
a full recovery.[cheering, whooping]

22:54.068 --> 22:56.462
And there's more.
According to the docs,

22:56.505 --> 22:59.595
Cooper wouldn't have made it
if it wasn't for Sergeant Kay.

22:59.639 --> 23:01.423
OFFICER:All right, Deac.[cheering, whistling]

23:01.467 --> 23:03.033
All right, Deac!

23:03.077 --> 23:04.861
All right, all right. That's
enough, that's enough.

23:04.905 --> 23:06.863
I'm sure the surgeons
deserve the real credit.

23:06.907 --> 23:08.648
OFFICER:
Way to go, Deac.Yes.

23:09.562 --> 23:10.911
Congrats.

23:12.869 --> 23:14.610
It's nice to see
our two departments

23:14.654 --> 23:16.612
getting along for once.

23:17.570 --> 23:19.136
What's up?

23:19.180 --> 23:21.878
Don't tell me you're already
missing our usual rivalry.

23:23.880 --> 23:25.969
Just thinking
about the Princely Terrace fire.

23:26.013 --> 23:28.450
You know, you can be a hero

23:28.494 --> 23:30.452
99% of the time...Yeah, but it's
that one percent

23:30.496 --> 23:31.540
that keeps us up at night.

23:31.584 --> 23:33.107
I'm the one that made the call.

23:33.150 --> 23:34.978
I pulled my guys out.

23:35.022 --> 23:37.720
Left Adam Max's family
inside to die.

23:37.764 --> 23:39.461
That building
was coming down.

23:39.505 --> 23:42.116
All the major structural support
was starting to collapse.

23:42.159 --> 23:43.596
You protected your men.

23:43.639 --> 23:45.467
It's a brutal call,

23:45.511 --> 23:46.729
but it's the
burden we bear.

23:46.773 --> 23:48.688
I ordered them out

23:48.731 --> 23:51.778
even though I could still hear
people screaming inside.

23:52.822 --> 23:55.477
Cooper took a bullet this
morning. It should've been me.

23:55.521 --> 23:57.479
Hey, hey, come on.

23:57.523 --> 24:00.003
Don't even begin to go
there, you hear me?

24:00.047 --> 24:01.831
Commander, Captain,
you have a phone call.

24:01.875 --> 24:02.832
It's Adam Max.

24:06.923 --> 24:10.274
Mr. Max, this is Commander
Hicks, LAPD SWAT.

24:10.318 --> 24:13.930
MAX:
I have no interest
in talking to you, Commander.

24:13.974 --> 24:16.585
I'm calling for Captain Hauser.

24:16.629 --> 24:18.718
I know he's there.

24:18.761 --> 24:20.807
I'm here.

24:20.850 --> 24:21.851
I'm listening.

24:21.895 --> 24:23.592
You're a coward, Hauser.

24:23.636 --> 24:26.508
Same as you were the night
that you let my family die.

24:26.552 --> 24:28.249
But that won't stop me.

24:28.292 --> 24:29.685
Now, if you

24:29.729 --> 24:32.079
and your men are gonna hide
in your little bunker,

24:32.122 --> 24:34.777
then all of LAFD

24:34.821 --> 24:36.823
is fair game, you understand me?

24:36.866 --> 24:38.128
It's open season,

24:38.172 --> 24:40.696
and their deaths
are gonna be on your hands,

24:40.740 --> 24:42.219
just like the deaths

24:42.263 --> 24:44.265
of my wife and my daughter.

24:44.308 --> 24:45.745
HAUSER: Mr. Max,
if we could just...

24:45.788 --> 24:47.224
just talk...MAX:
No.

24:47.268 --> 24:48.312
No more talk.

24:48.356 --> 24:50.140
Court testimony,

24:50.184 --> 24:52.099
depositions-- I heard it all.

24:52.142 --> 24:54.275
The time for talk is over.

24:54.318 --> 24:57.104
It's time to act now.Mr. Max,

24:57.147 --> 24:58.888
whatever you're
planning to do,

24:58.932 --> 25:02.501
it's not gonna bring your
wife and daughter back.

25:04.938 --> 25:06.766
Mr. Max?

25:06.809 --> 25:10.073
Mr. Max? Tan, you got anything?

25:10.117 --> 25:11.553
The call pinged off
three different towers

25:11.597 --> 25:12.815
in the North Valley.
He's in motion.

25:12.859 --> 25:14.556
Could be on the 5,
maybe the 210.

25:14.600 --> 25:15.818
We roll units,
he'll be ten miles

25:15.862 --> 25:17.080
down the road by the
time we get there.

25:17.124 --> 25:18.952
Tell Hondo I want all teams

25:18.995 --> 25:20.344
on standby, ready to roll.

25:20.388 --> 25:22.782
We'll monitor Fire Dispatch.

25:22.825 --> 25:24.784
That's the best we
can do right now.

25:24.827 --> 25:26.002
There's no way you can protect
every firefighter

25:26.046 --> 25:27.656
in Los Angeles.No.

25:27.700 --> 25:29.266
There's not.

25:36.709 --> 25:38.058
What happened?

25:38.101 --> 25:39.973
The Sylmar station got a call

25:40.016 --> 25:41.931
from a rideshare driver.
Said he pulled over

25:41.975 --> 25:43.672
because his passenger
was in labor.

25:43.716 --> 25:45.195
When the paramedics
and firefighters showed up,

25:45.239 --> 25:46.893
the car exploded.HICKS:
It's another trap,

25:46.936 --> 25:48.634
only he's changed his game.

25:48.677 --> 25:49.939
Firebomb instead of a rifle.

25:49.983 --> 25:51.419
Calling the station directly
instead of 911.

25:51.462 --> 25:53.987
I feel like we're falling behind
rather than catching up.

25:54.030 --> 25:55.684
How bad?

25:55.728 --> 25:57.643
Two more firemen injured.

25:57.686 --> 25:58.687
HONDO:
We're lucky it wasn't worse.

25:58.731 --> 26:00.036
Talked to CHP on scene.

26:00.080 --> 26:01.385
That explosion was designed

26:01.429 --> 26:02.778
to throw burning gasoline,

26:02.822 --> 26:04.084
incinerate anyone in its radius.

26:04.127 --> 26:05.215
HAUSER:He wanted to see
firefighters burn.

26:05.259 --> 26:07.696
All on my account.HICKS:
Hey.

26:07.740 --> 26:08.958
This isn't on you.

26:09.002 --> 26:10.917
I wish that were true.

26:18.968 --> 26:20.927
Molly.

26:20.970 --> 26:23.059
What's up?I know you're busy,

26:23.103 --> 26:25.714
but I called the prison
to check on your mom.

26:25.758 --> 26:26.933
You did what?

26:26.976 --> 26:28.064
MOLLY:
She wasn't lying, Jim.

26:28.108 --> 26:29.326
I talked to a doctor.

26:29.370 --> 26:30.632
It's something with her liver.

26:30.676 --> 26:32.765
They're transferring her
to a hospital for tests.

26:32.808 --> 26:34.375
It's bad.Molly, I told you,

26:34.418 --> 26:36.725
I want nothing to do with her,
okay? You know our history.

26:36.769 --> 26:39.859
Her-her drug abuse.
Alcohol. Violence.

26:39.902 --> 26:41.034
MOLLY: And every one
of those things

26:41.077 --> 26:42.731
is consistent
with her being abused.

26:42.775 --> 26:44.864
Do not go making her a victim.

26:44.907 --> 26:46.909
Babe, she is a victim.

26:46.953 --> 26:49.259
I deal with women like
your mother all the time,

26:49.303 --> 26:50.913
their lives destroyed

26:50.957 --> 26:53.786
by the trauma of being abused
and never getting help.

26:53.829 --> 26:55.657
20 years ago,
she needed treatment,

26:55.701 --> 26:58.094
and all she's had
is a life of black eyes

26:58.138 --> 26:59.748
and incarceration.So, you're saying

26:59.792 --> 27:02.316
this is my fault
for having her locked up again?No.

27:02.359 --> 27:04.666
But, Jim, this is the woman
who gave birth to you.

27:04.710 --> 27:07.669
And dragged me through hell
every day since.

27:07.713 --> 27:09.366
She betrayed me, lied to me.

27:09.410 --> 27:12.892
She stole from me. She almost
cost me my career at SWAT.

27:12.935 --> 27:14.894
I really can't believe
you're taking her side on this.

27:14.937 --> 27:16.373
I'm not taking sides.

27:16.417 --> 27:18.375
Well, don't you think
maybe you should be?

27:18.419 --> 27:20.029
You know what?

27:20.073 --> 27:23.163
I can't do this right now.
I'm at work, okay? I just...

27:23.206 --> 27:25.165
can't do this.

27:25.208 --> 27:26.775
[door opens]

27:26.819 --> 27:28.951
COLLINS: Come on,
let's see it. Uh-huh.

27:28.995 --> 27:31.127
31. 32.

27:31.171 --> 27:32.781
Come on, baby, let's go.
You got this.

27:32.825 --> 27:34.043
Not a chance.

27:34.087 --> 27:35.392
He can't touch my record.

27:35.436 --> 27:37.351
Come on, let's go. Let's go.STEVENS: Is that it?

27:37.394 --> 27:38.874
COLLINS: Hey, don't listento them, all right? Five more.STEVENS: Is that it?

27:38.918 --> 27:40.702
COLLINS:Let's see it. Uh-huh.[grunts]

27:40.746 --> 27:43.792
Winner and still champion!

27:43.836 --> 27:46.012
Bradley. where's your captain?

27:46.055 --> 27:47.491
Not sure. Haven't seen him.

27:47.535 --> 27:49.450
Anybody know where Hauser is?

27:49.493 --> 27:51.800
Well, Deac, what's going on?

27:51.844 --> 27:53.976
Commander.

27:54.020 --> 27:55.978
I think Hauser's gone
and done something stupid.

27:56.022 --> 27:57.110
What do you mean?Deacon

27:57.153 --> 27:58.372
went back
into Adam Max's social media

27:58.415 --> 28:00.113
and found a reply
to one of Max's rants.

28:00.156 --> 28:02.724
It's from Captain Hauser,
posted 15 minutes ago.

28:02.768 --> 28:05.379
"I'm the one you're angry
at. Let's talk in person."

28:05.422 --> 28:07.903
He gave Max his number,
and now he's gone.

28:07.947 --> 28:09.122
Ah, he's gonna give himself up

28:09.165 --> 28:10.819
hoping to save his men,
for God's sakes.

28:10.863 --> 28:12.429
I'll start a trace
on Hauser's phone,

28:12.473 --> 28:14.040
send you
the tracking information.

28:26.443 --> 28:28.881
I'm surprised you had
the guts to show up.

28:30.099 --> 28:32.058
Given your track record.

28:32.101 --> 28:35.801
I came
because I needed to apologize.Apologize?

28:35.844 --> 28:38.281
You think there's some version
of this where I forgive you?

28:39.326 --> 28:40.283
You let

28:40.327 --> 28:43.417
my wife and my little girl

28:43.460 --> 28:46.028
burn to death.You're right.

28:46.072 --> 28:48.291
And every day,
I've wanted to tell you

28:48.335 --> 28:50.337
how sorry I am,
but the city wouldn't let me.

28:50.380 --> 28:53.819
Liability, they said.

28:53.862 --> 28:57.126
Adam, I am so sorry
that we couldn't save them."Couldn't"?

28:57.170 --> 28:58.301
That we didn't.

28:58.345 --> 29:01.043
That Ididn't save them.

29:01.087 --> 29:03.002
But if we had tried,

29:03.045 --> 29:04.743
my men would have died, too.

29:06.353 --> 29:07.789
No.

29:07.833 --> 29:09.356
It's too late for excuses.

29:09.399 --> 29:12.533
It was too late the moment
that you let them die.

29:12.576 --> 29:15.231
Okay. What do you want from me?

29:15.275 --> 29:17.799
Over there. Go.

29:17.843 --> 29:18.931
Okay.

29:18.974 --> 29:20.193

accomplish anything.

what you must've gone through.No.

30:40.012 --> 30:41.883
You can't. You can't imagine.

30:41.927 --> 30:43.624
See, you let my family die,

30:43.667 --> 30:45.452
and now you're
gonna die. Yeah.

30:45.495 --> 30:47.889

gonna burn just like they did.

I'm looking for a way out?

on that trailer...

motive being what?

that she gives a crap

who've had a messed-up life?

35:56.719 --> 35:58.373

35:58.417 --> 36:00.723
your mom screwed up a lot
of stuff in your life.

everythingin my life.Okay.

this thing with Molly now, too?

Deac said you wanted
to see me.

36:13.345 --> 36:15.434
I'm guessing it's about
my performance today?

Where in your training
did you get the idea

36:18.045 --> 36:20.439
that it was acceptable to expose
yourself to unnecessary risk,

I messed up. I just...

and execution.

that we're never gonna have
to have this conversation again.

So, let me start
by saying I'm sorry.

37:28.942 --> 37:31.553
I was a total ass, and, uh,

37:31.597 --> 37:33.555
I shouldn't have
gone off like I did.

37:33.599 --> 37:35.296
It's just...

37:35.340 --> 37:38.430
when I turned my mom in
and got her locked up again,

37:38.473 --> 37:40.693
I convinced myself
that it was the right thing,

37:40.736 --> 37:42.782
that she needed help.

37:44.610 --> 37:46.742
But I wrestle with that.

37:46.786 --> 37:49.354
You know, maybe I just did it...

37:49.397 --> 37:51.094
to make my life easier.

37:51.138 --> 37:54.620
So, between the call today,

37:54.663 --> 37:56.926
and-and then you telling me
that she's sick,

37:56.970 --> 37:58.798
I guess I just
couldn't deal.

38:00.800 --> 38:02.932
You know, you still have
time to fix things with her.

38:02.976 --> 38:06.675
That's just it, though.
I'm-I'm not sure that I want to.

38:08.460 --> 38:12.942
Listen, Molly, I know
that you lost your mother,

38:12.986 --> 38:15.118
and how devastating
that was for you,

38:15.162 --> 38:17.338
but it's just not
the same situation for me.

38:17.382 --> 38:19.035
So you're just gonna do what?

A thousand times.

who can I talk to?

just-just for a little while?

Uh, got to be honest.
Hurts like hell.

40:10.495 --> 40:11.844
Talked to the doc.

40:11.887 --> 40:13.976
Heard you're gonna make
a full recovery.

40:15.064 --> 40:17.458
Guess I really owe that
to you, Deacon.

40:17.502 --> 40:20.069
Yeah, I wish I...

40:20.113 --> 40:22.550
knew how to tell you
just how grateful I am.

40:22.594 --> 40:24.073
All right, stop.

40:24.117 --> 40:25.684
I did what anybody
would've done.

40:25.727 --> 40:27.076
You would have done
the same for me.

40:27.120 --> 40:29.557
No, don't be so sure.
After all, he is LAFD.

40:29.601 --> 40:30.993
[laughter]

40:31.037 --> 40:32.691
I had the guys
bring you something.

40:32.734 --> 40:34.432
It's in the bag there.

40:39.872 --> 40:42.657
HONDO:
Oh, ho. That's
the real deal.

40:47.749 --> 40:49.795
Heard you even
handled a hose today.

40:49.838 --> 40:52.275
Only a two-inch line
at 50% pressure.

40:52.319 --> 40:54.843
[laughter]

40:54.887 --> 40:56.454
But you're one of us now.

40:58.020 --> 40:59.718
Hell of an honor,
receiving one of those, Deac.

40:59.761 --> 41:01.110
Yeah.

41:01.154 --> 41:03.722
Thank you.
That, uh, means a lot.

41:03.765 --> 41:05.854
Yup.Now, uh,

41:05.898 --> 41:07.290
just get yourself better,
all right, so I don't have

41:07.334 --> 41:09.031
to put this on and
do your job for you.

41:09.075 --> 41:11.773
[laughter]

41:11.817 --> 41:13.166
Oh.

41:13.209 --> 41:14.559
[laughs]
