WEBVTT

00:02.393 --> 00:03.612
- Previously,
on the Kings of Napa...

00:03.655 --> 00:05.135
- She left.
- Your sister has a condition

00:05.179 --> 00:06.745
called African Sleeping
Sickness.

00:06.789 --> 00:08.051
She has slipped into a coma.

00:08.095 --> 00:09.531
- Someone is threatening
our family?

00:09.574 --> 00:11.794
- Two more weeks, and you gotta
pay this person again.

00:11.837 --> 00:13.883
- All the evidence is pointing
towards Bridgette.

00:13.926 --> 00:16.016
- She's not doing this alone.
- Let me go!

00:16.059 --> 00:19.845
- What is your strategy going
head-to-head with Sean & Shawn's
new dessert wine?

00:19.889 --> 00:21.325
Theirs has a similar taste.

00:21.369 --> 00:23.153
- I hope you're not dating me
for my position.

00:23.197 --> 00:25.025
- Kelvin is defending
Bridgette?!

00:25.068 --> 00:26.504
- I got a closer look at
the evidence,

00:26.548 --> 00:28.028
and something is just
not adding up.

00:28.071 --> 00:29.942
- What the hell are you doing
in my house?

00:29.986 --> 00:31.248
Are you leaving with her?

00:41.389 --> 00:44.435
[sighing]
- Hey, I've been calling you
all week.

00:44.479 --> 00:46.307
- This is called ghosting.

00:46.350 --> 00:49.484
It's a play term,
but it is still applicable.

00:49.527 --> 00:51.921
How did you even get in here?

00:51.964 --> 00:53.183
- Dana let me in.

00:53.227 --> 00:56.056
Look, I am sorry about
the other night.

00:56.099 --> 00:58.058
Sonya had no business
rolling up at your house.

00:58.101 --> 01:01.278
- You told her we weren't what
she thought.

01:01.322 --> 01:02.714
- I didn't mean it like that.

01:02.758 --> 01:04.238
- I thought you were getting
a divorce.

01:04.281 --> 01:06.675
- Look, I am in the middle of
a custody battle,

01:06.718 --> 01:09.069
and she is using everything
she has against me.

01:09.112 --> 01:13.247
- I can match with a guy
on Hinge who has less drama
than this.

01:13.290 --> 01:15.684
Please, can you leave?
- Really?

01:15.727 --> 01:17.294
- Yeah.

01:17.338 --> 01:20.123
You're representing my sister.
Again!

01:20.167 --> 01:22.517
Your wife is showing up
at my doorstep,

01:22.560 --> 01:24.345
and I don't know if
you've noticed,

01:24.388 --> 01:26.782
but I'm trying to run a company.

01:28.044 --> 01:29.828
Get out.

01:31.613 --> 01:33.049
- Wow.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.356
[rhythmic R&B music]

01:37.793 --> 01:39.360
August...

01:43.190 --> 01:46.018
I'm falling back in love
with you.

01:46.062 --> 01:48.456
I'm not gonna go that easy.

01:50.110 --> 01:53.113
- Remember when we first
reconnected

01:53.156 --> 01:55.898
I told you I was
the whole damn restaurant?

01:55.941 --> 01:57.334
- Yeah.

01:58.030 --> 02:01.295
- Yeah, I'm not the side chick,
Kelvin.

02:01.338 --> 02:03.775
I'm not the sneak tip.
I'm a catch.

02:03.819 --> 02:07.431
And do you know what you do with
catches, Kelvin?

02:09.433 --> 02:10.869
- No.

02:10.913 --> 02:12.436
- You savor them.

02:12.480 --> 02:15.135
You put them on pedestals.

02:15.178 --> 02:17.137
You treat them like queens.

02:17.180 --> 02:20.618
- Yeah. Queen, up.

02:21.445 --> 02:26.755
- If you ever pull a fast one
like that you will never,

02:26.798 --> 02:30.237
ever get any of this again.
Do you understand me?

02:30.933 --> 02:33.153
- Yeah, I'm on notice.

02:33.196 --> 02:34.589
- Bet.

02:37.244 --> 02:38.810
[objects clattering]

02:40.029 --> 02:41.291
[theme music]

03:08.797 --> 03:10.712
[upbeat music]

03:23.290 --> 03:25.640
Um, I spoke to the DA

03:25.683 --> 03:29.034
and she may need to question
all of us in Bridgette's case.

03:29.078 --> 03:31.646
- I'm ready for war.
The Second Punic War.

03:31.689 --> 03:34.823
The Mongol Conquest, the Battles
of the Three Kingdoms.

03:34.866 --> 03:36.128
- You're trippin', Dana.

03:36.172 --> 03:38.174
- Yeah, the only silver lining
in all of this

03:38.218 --> 03:41.264
is that we don't have to worry
about paying another 150 Gs.

03:41.308 --> 03:45.137
- I don't know.
I still have my doubts about
Bridgette being guilty.

03:45.181 --> 03:48.402
- Don't be on Team Yvette.
- Whatever.

03:48.445 --> 03:53.102
I suggest we all get
foot massages today to relax,

03:53.145 --> 03:56.279
or ask the kitchen to make us
some filet mignon

03:56.323 --> 03:58.716
with red wine sauce and dates.

03:58.760 --> 04:03.547
- I am just focusing on
reworking our dessert wine,

04:03.591 --> 04:07.247
getting rid of any traces
that feel like Sean & Shawn.

04:07.290 --> 04:10.424
- We can do both. How about
foot massages at my desk?

04:10.467 --> 04:12.295
I'm working on the production
calendar,

04:12.339 --> 04:14.254
so we can beat
Sean & Shawn to the punch.

04:14.297 --> 04:16.343
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah? Okay.

04:18.258 --> 04:21.086
Rose? You're back.

04:22.087 --> 04:23.306
Hi.

04:25.047 --> 04:27.049
- How was your week in New York,
honey?

04:27.092 --> 04:28.790
- Nice. Relaxing.

04:29.704 --> 04:31.836
Missed you.
- I've missed you too.

04:31.880 --> 04:34.883
We were worried about you.
Weren't we?

04:34.926 --> 04:36.014
- Yeah!

04:36.058 --> 04:38.060
- Yes. Just glad you're okay,
honey.

04:38.103 --> 04:39.191
- What's this about Bridgette?

04:39.235 --> 04:41.672
The DA's filing charges
against her?

04:41.716 --> 04:44.196
- Hmm, so you spoke to her.
- I got a message.

04:44.240 --> 04:46.547
There's no way she would do
something like this.

04:46.590 --> 04:48.549
She loves those vines.

04:48.592 --> 04:51.291
- We all know what she did
for this place.

04:51.334 --> 04:53.336
- And we get that you
and Bridgette are close,

04:53.380 --> 04:54.990
but you don't know the facts.

04:55.033 --> 04:58.602
- You've gone mental.
- Bridgette broke the law.

04:58.646 --> 05:01.431
As hard as that is to hear,
she needs to be punished.

05:01.475 --> 05:04.652
Why don't we go outside
and talk?

05:09.396 --> 05:13.617
- Oh! Do it right there!

05:13.661 --> 05:17.055
[gasping]
That's my sweet spot!

05:17.099 --> 05:18.535
That's it!

05:18.579 --> 05:20.929
- Auntie, Auntie, Auntie...
You've got to call Rosebay

05:20.972 --> 05:23.366
or McKindle about distributing
the dessert wine,

05:23.410 --> 05:26.630
and I don't want it to sound
as if you're in the middle of
a gigantic orgasm.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.545
- So...

05:30.417 --> 05:33.376
Are we just going to pretend
that Rose didn't just walk up
in here

05:33.420 --> 05:35.944
defending her new love thing
Bridgette?

05:35.987 --> 05:37.685
- Who told you about Bridgette
and Rose?

05:37.728 --> 05:39.556
- Dana and I are tight.

05:39.600 --> 05:43.255
Shit's about to get super saucy
up in here, child.

05:43.299 --> 05:45.388
I know she used to date girls.

05:45.432 --> 05:47.303
- Focus on getting another
distributor.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.393
- You're allowed to gossip
and work, August.

05:50.437 --> 05:52.264
That's what makes it jazzy
and fun.

05:52.308 --> 05:56.878
I put 20 on Rose easing on down
the road to Bridgette's.

05:56.921 --> 05:58.183
Watch.

05:58.227 --> 05:59.576
- Well, I hope not.

06:00.185 --> 06:02.013
Because without her...

06:02.492 --> 06:05.234
Dana's really gonna be in
my ass.

06:05.277 --> 06:06.627
- What's going on with you?

06:06.670 --> 06:08.411
Are you seeing someone else?

06:08.455 --> 06:10.848
Come on, tell me.

06:10.892 --> 06:12.763
Why would you leave
and then...

06:12.807 --> 06:14.809
send a cryptic text about
needing space?

06:14.852 --> 06:17.202
- I got scared.
I started panicking.

06:17.246 --> 06:20.380
- About what?
- About us! About this!

06:20.423 --> 06:23.383
- Look. I saw you kissing
Bridgette.

06:24.384 --> 06:28.300
I went over to the house
to drop something for
Aunt Melanie, and I saw you.

06:28.736 --> 06:30.259
Were you having an affair
with her?

06:30.302 --> 06:33.436
- Come on, it was one kiss.
- But you left the next day!

06:33.480 --> 06:35.395
You were toying with something,
debating it.

06:35.438 --> 06:39.050
Remember when we took
that gondola ride in Venice
after the wedding?

06:39.094 --> 06:43.185
We promised that we would always
be honest with each other.

06:43.228 --> 06:44.447
Do you still want this
relationship?

06:44.491 --> 06:46.406
- Yes, of course, Dana!

06:46.449 --> 06:48.451
I just got a little confused,

06:48.495 --> 06:50.148
but this past week made me
realize

06:50.192 --> 06:52.803
I want to fight for
what we have.

06:52.847 --> 06:54.457
- Don't placate me.
- I'm not.

06:54.501 --> 06:58.330
Let's start fertility treatments
again. Build a family.

06:58.374 --> 07:00.811
I don't want to lose you, Dana.

07:00.855 --> 07:02.770
I love you.

07:05.555 --> 07:07.557
- I love you too.

07:11.996 --> 07:14.216
- Girl, I'm so glad you came
for lunch.

07:14.521 --> 07:17.349
- I check on your aunt every
day. She's doing better.

07:17.393 --> 07:20.135
- That's good.
Thank you for doing that.

07:21.832 --> 07:23.312
- Look, I need to tell you
something.

07:23.355 --> 07:24.879
- Okay.

07:25.401 --> 07:28.273
- Bridgette asked me to be
a character witness in the case,

07:28.317 --> 07:29.666
and I said yes.

07:31.015 --> 07:32.887
She needs people to speak
on her behalf.

07:32.930 --> 07:34.671
It's not as if her mother can.

07:34.715 --> 07:38.327
- So, we're just going to ignore
all the evidence?

07:38.370 --> 07:41.243
- She's your sister.
She's stressed

07:41.286 --> 07:43.375
and is suddenly the town pariah.

07:43.419 --> 07:44.855
- Do you believe her?

07:45.552 --> 07:47.075
- I don't know.

07:47.118 --> 07:48.642
- Oh.

07:50.295 --> 07:51.471
Well...

07:52.950 --> 07:55.475
I have to protect this vineyard.

07:56.127 --> 07:58.086
All of this is on me.

07:58.129 --> 08:01.568
- Since when do you let business
be more important than people?

08:03.004 --> 08:05.615
[scoffing]
You've changed.

08:06.050 --> 08:08.531
And I'm starting not to
recognize you.

08:10.011 --> 08:14.450
August. This business,
your dad's legacy,

08:15.146 --> 08:16.713
it isn't everything.

08:18.585 --> 08:20.108
Or is it?

08:20.151 --> 08:22.371
I should get back to
the hospital.

08:35.950 --> 08:38.343
- Well, look what the cat
dragged in.

08:38.387 --> 08:40.389
You haven't returned my calls.

08:40.432 --> 08:42.173
- Things got complicated.

08:42.217 --> 08:44.436
[chuckling]
I needed to get away.

08:44.480 --> 08:45.742
You're alright?

08:45.786 --> 08:47.744
- Are you serious?

08:47.788 --> 08:49.920
My mother's in the hospital
fighting for her life,

08:49.964 --> 08:53.445
and my family thinks I'm shaking
them down for money.

08:53.489 --> 08:55.535
- It's okay.
- It's not!

08:55.796 --> 08:58.276
I'm facing 20 years!

09:03.978 --> 09:06.197
You're back with Dana,
aren't you?

09:06.241 --> 09:09.505
- Bridgette, he's my husband.
- Unbelievable.

09:10.332 --> 09:14.597
- He's a complicated being,
I know. But I love him.

09:14.641 --> 09:16.338
And I need to build
this family.

09:16.381 --> 09:19.515
We're trying for a baby
and I can't throw it all away.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.997
I didn't expect to feel what
I felt for you...

09:23.475 --> 09:24.738
but it happened.

09:24.781 --> 09:27.610
But it doesn't take away
from years of laughs.

09:27.654 --> 09:29.786
I'm sharing everything I have
with Dana.

09:30.395 --> 09:33.442
When I was in New York,
I remembered

09:33.485 --> 09:35.183
how sweet and kind he was.

09:35.226 --> 09:37.577
But he's allowed this
competition to take over.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.709
- I gotta go to my lawyer.
- Bridgette.

09:39.753 --> 09:41.406
- Can you move, please?

09:43.539 --> 09:45.585
[rhythmic music]

09:51.068 --> 09:53.505
- Is it true you knew
your uncle was your father?

09:53.549 --> 09:54.898
- Yes.

09:54.942 --> 09:56.683
- Why didn't you say anything
when you found out?

09:56.726 --> 09:59.294
- Keeping that secret was
the hardest thing I've ever had
to do.

10:00.382 --> 10:04.604
- But when you did finally
get fired, why not come clean?

10:04.647 --> 10:05.996
- I don't know.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.650
- So, you had countless
opportunities

10:07.694 --> 10:09.652
to set the record straight,
yet you said nothing.

10:09.696 --> 10:12.612
- What was I going to do?
Write it on a Post-it and leave
it on the door?

10:12.655 --> 10:16.877
Uncle Reggie acted like
my father way before I even
knew,

10:16.920 --> 10:18.792
and I didn't want that
to go away.

10:19.967 --> 10:21.925
No, I didn't tell them
about Dad.

10:21.969 --> 10:23.666
- So, instead of telling him
you knew the truth,

10:23.710 --> 10:25.712
you extorted him.
- I didn't...

10:25.755 --> 10:27.801
I didn't do it.

10:33.023 --> 10:36.636
- Bridgette, listen.
I believe you.

10:36.679 --> 10:38.681
But I'm not letting you
take the stand.

10:38.725 --> 10:40.509
You're way too emotional.

10:40.552 --> 10:42.859
So let's go over what
we have again.

10:42.903 --> 10:44.731
- I gotta make a call.

10:45.819 --> 10:49.474
This is bullshit.
You need to put me up there.

10:49.518 --> 10:51.346
August needs to be stopped.

10:51.825 --> 10:54.218
[upbeat music playing]

10:55.742 --> 10:59.702
- Mmm, Grace, you're a magician.

10:59.746 --> 11:02.052
You are saving our butts.

11:02.096 --> 11:05.055
How did you come up
with a new dessert wine so fast?

11:05.099 --> 11:07.623
- When the press said
that the other one tasted like

11:07.667 --> 11:09.538
Sean & Shawn's dessert wine,

11:09.581 --> 11:11.583
no, we needed to regroup quick.

11:11.627 --> 11:13.934
- This lady ain't playing.

11:15.457 --> 11:17.677
- We just need to add a little
more kick to it.

11:17.720 --> 11:20.375
[phone ringing]
Okay, I'm sorry.

11:22.551 --> 11:24.684
[indistinct chattering]

11:24.727 --> 11:26.381
[computerized voice]:
Thought you could get rid
of me that easy?

11:26.424 --> 11:29.166
It's time to pay up again.
- I don't know who this is,

11:29.210 --> 11:31.647
but we've already got Bridgette,
and we're coming for you.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.737
- Don't even think of calling
the police on me again.

11:34.781 --> 11:37.827
Things can get much worse.

11:39.611 --> 11:41.309
- Who was that?

11:41.352 --> 11:42.963
- I don't know.

11:43.006 --> 11:45.617
Whoever's working with
Bridgette?

11:47.010 --> 11:48.925
When is this gonna end?

11:50.666 --> 11:52.407
Where's Dana?

11:52.450 --> 11:54.322
[Amanda]: If Bridgette does
in fact have a partner,

11:54.365 --> 11:56.585
we should have people go with
you to pay the money.

11:56.628 --> 11:59.631
If we catch her, we'll be able
to immediately revoke her bail.

11:59.675 --> 12:01.242
- Love that, Amanda.

12:01.285 --> 12:04.114
But how would it all play out?
Give us the deets.

12:04.158 --> 12:06.551
- August would drop the money
and we would have officers

12:06.595 --> 12:08.640
hiding out to see who picks
it up.

12:08.684 --> 12:10.120
If it's Bridgette,
they make an arrest.

12:10.164 --> 12:11.774
If she's working with
a partner,

12:11.818 --> 12:13.994
we can force her to take a deal
and roll on them.

12:14.037 --> 12:15.778
- We'll do what it takes.

12:15.822 --> 12:17.475
- Look, I'm preparing our case.

12:17.519 --> 12:19.739
Bring whatever you think is
important by my office.

12:19.782 --> 12:23.307
- Yep. Here's some of
the license plates that I ran.

12:23.351 --> 12:26.136
There were cars that
didn't belong to anyone
who worked here,

12:26.180 --> 12:29.487
but were seen around
the house, or Bridgette's,

12:29.531 --> 12:32.360
or the place where
you dropped off the money.

12:32.403 --> 12:35.624
The grey one with the dent
was in your dad's office in
a folder.

12:35.667 --> 12:37.931
I thought he might have been
eyeing it,

12:37.974 --> 12:40.629
but nothing panned out.
- What else do you have?

12:40.672 --> 12:43.414
- All the surveillance
photos of folks who had beef
with your father.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.677
Your dad's bank statements,
e-mails,

12:45.721 --> 12:48.028
records of the extortion calls,
you name it.

12:48.071 --> 12:52.119
- This is great.
Let's get this to the DA, ASAP.

12:52.684 --> 12:54.512
[machine beeping]

12:54.556 --> 12:56.253
[anchorwoman]: We are outside
of the mayor's office.

12:56.297 --> 12:59.343
Numerous sources tell me
she intends to make a statement

12:59.387 --> 13:02.477
regarding potential school
closings by the end of the day.

13:02.520 --> 13:03.913
[laughing]

13:03.957 --> 13:08.352
- What's so funny?
- That girl was my intern.

13:09.701 --> 13:11.007
- Oh, that's what's up.

13:11.051 --> 13:14.532
I, um, I heard about
what you did.

13:14.924 --> 13:17.709
I think it's gangster.

13:18.493 --> 13:22.323
Women should be able to go and
pursue their dreams.

13:22.366 --> 13:24.934
Had Dad moved to New York
for a year to start a company,

13:24.978 --> 13:27.458
no one would be saying jack.

13:27.502 --> 13:29.809
- I love how enlightened
you are getting.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.680
But you might've felt
differently

13:31.723 --> 13:34.248
if you'd already been born
at that time

13:34.291 --> 13:35.727
and it was you I was leaving,
honey.

13:35.771 --> 13:38.295
- Maybe you should go back
to it, you know?

13:38.339 --> 13:40.645
Get that coin, do your thing!

13:40.689 --> 13:42.734
- That is the world according
to Christian.

13:42.778 --> 13:44.998
[laughing]
- You sound like Sheila.

13:45.041 --> 13:48.088
She's always clowning me on life
being The Christian Show.

13:48.131 --> 13:50.786
- Is that that girl you've been
bringing around the house

13:50.830 --> 13:52.440
in and out late at night?

13:52.483 --> 13:56.661
Am I gonna meet this one?
- Maybe soon, but look...

13:57.140 --> 14:00.883
You got swag, that look,
a dope ass home,

14:00.927 --> 14:02.798
and your youngest son is lit.

14:02.842 --> 14:06.236
- Baby, I am too old to go back
on the air in today's market.

14:06.280 --> 14:07.498
[coughing]

14:08.108 --> 14:11.720
My god, Melanie.
It's okay. We're here.

14:13.417 --> 14:14.897
- Vanessa?

14:14.941 --> 14:17.073
- Christian, go get a doctor.
Hurry.

14:20.642 --> 14:21.904
- Hey!
- Hey.

14:21.948 --> 14:23.514
- What's up?

14:23.950 --> 14:25.647
- I have to tell you something.

14:26.126 --> 14:27.910
We're in a really good place
right now,

14:27.954 --> 14:29.912
and I don't want to do
anything behind your back.

14:29.956 --> 14:31.044
Nor you me.

14:32.436 --> 14:34.569
But they want me to wear a wire
to nab Bridgette.

14:34.612 --> 14:36.092
- We're going to court.

14:36.136 --> 14:38.181
- Well, she and whoever
she's working with called today

14:38.225 --> 14:39.922
demanding another drop of money.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.924
- Wait, what?
- Mm-hmm.

14:41.968 --> 14:43.491
- What time was it?

14:43.534 --> 14:44.927
- Around two.

14:44.971 --> 14:47.147
- That's impossible.
She was not a part of that call.

14:47.190 --> 14:49.018
She was with me all afternoon.

14:49.627 --> 14:50.890
- Oh.

14:50.933 --> 14:52.848
- Oh, shit.

14:52.892 --> 14:53.893
[sighing]

14:53.936 --> 14:56.634
- What? What happened?

14:56.678 --> 14:58.767
- She did step out during
our meeting to make a call.

14:59.507 --> 15:01.988
She seemed pressed.
- See?

15:02.031 --> 15:03.859
- How about we trace it?

15:03.903 --> 15:06.253
I'll have by buddy down at
the police precinct to compare.

15:06.296 --> 15:08.559
If the call came from
this office, then you're right.

15:08.603 --> 15:10.561
She and this mysterious guy
are behind this.

15:10.605 --> 15:12.737
But if that call wasn't
made from here,

15:12.781 --> 15:14.914
then you have to be open
to the possibility

15:14.957 --> 15:16.567
that she has nothing
to do with this.

15:16.611 --> 15:19.396
And this could be worse
than we think.

15:21.007 --> 15:23.357
- Fine. Let's do it.

15:26.926 --> 15:30.538
- We are gonna need to keep you
under observation for a while.

15:30.581 --> 15:33.671
- Thank you.
Thank you for everything.

15:33.715 --> 15:35.151
- Thanks, James.

15:38.850 --> 15:40.591
- I'm just glad you're here.

15:40.635 --> 15:42.985
- I want to get past this,
Melanie.

15:43.029 --> 15:44.900
I really do.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.250
Despite what we've been through,

15:47.294 --> 15:49.296
I want you to know I love you.

15:49.339 --> 15:51.515
But seeing you on that ground,

15:51.559 --> 15:55.955
I promised myself that if
you woke up...

15:57.652 --> 15:59.480
I would let go,

15:59.523 --> 16:03.223
and I would love you,
just like I loved you before.

16:04.833 --> 16:06.530
[machine beeping]

16:08.010 --> 16:09.577
- Vanessa...

16:12.536 --> 16:15.017
Reggie loved you.
- Melanie, don't.

16:15.061 --> 16:17.106
- I was a friend to him.

16:17.150 --> 16:19.413
He talked to me about you.

16:20.762 --> 16:23.678
He thought at times
that you didn't want him.

16:23.721 --> 16:27.029
He acted like it didn't bother
him, but...

16:28.291 --> 16:30.990
He thought you were going
to leave him again.

16:34.863 --> 16:36.908
- My poor Reggie.

16:37.605 --> 16:40.173
Melanie, if we're gonna
move forward,

16:40.216 --> 16:44.481
we have to lose the lies
and drama.

16:46.092 --> 16:47.876
- Beside hurting you,

16:48.616 --> 16:50.966
you know what kills me
in all this?

16:52.228 --> 16:57.016
Bridgette knew she was Reggie's
daughter.

16:58.060 --> 17:00.932
She kept that secret for years.

17:01.324 --> 17:03.587
How hard was that for her?

17:03.631 --> 17:05.459
- She'll get through it.

17:06.112 --> 17:08.157
- Will she ever forgive me?

17:08.201 --> 17:10.768
- Yes. Yes, of course she will.

17:10.812 --> 17:14.990
- Then get her here, please.
I need to see her.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.948
- Okay.
- Okay.

17:19.995 --> 17:21.257
- Hey, baby.
- Hmm?

17:21.301 --> 17:24.347
- Are you dozing off?
- No, no.

17:24.391 --> 17:26.784
I just need them to trace
that call.

17:26.828 --> 17:28.177
- Yeah.

17:28.569 --> 17:30.310
[phone vibrating]

17:31.746 --> 17:33.052
Hello?

17:34.009 --> 17:35.358
Yes?

17:36.707 --> 17:38.187
Okay?

17:38.883 --> 17:41.930
Okay. Thank you very much.

17:43.018 --> 17:44.367
- What?

17:44.411 --> 17:46.804
- The extortionist's call,
it came from East Napa.

17:46.848 --> 17:48.719
Bridgette was in San Fran.

17:48.763 --> 17:51.244
It was made the exact same time
as our meeting.

17:52.332 --> 17:54.725
- Wait, she could still be
working with a partner.

17:54.769 --> 17:57.424
- If she was working
with someone, she would get
them to stand down.

17:57.467 --> 17:58.990
She's looking at 20 years.

17:59.034 --> 18:02.342
A conspiracy charge would
keep her in jail 'til she's 60.

18:03.343 --> 18:05.040
- My brothers won't budge.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.216
They're convinced she's the one.

18:07.260 --> 18:09.479
They'll accuse me of
flip-flopping.

18:09.523 --> 18:11.046
- Alright.

18:14.049 --> 18:17.748
Let's look at everything we have
over dinner tonight.

18:17.792 --> 18:20.577
Maybe we missed something,
and the real criminal is still
out there.

18:20.621 --> 18:23.276
Then we can finally go to your
family with the truth.

18:25.191 --> 18:26.931
- Hi, this is Rose King.

18:27.323 --> 18:31.936
I started my period,
and I'm ready to start a new
fertility cycle.

18:32.415 --> 18:36.463
[woman]: Alright, but we still
need your husband's semen in
house for analysis.

18:36.506 --> 18:38.682
- Oh, he already left
his sample.

18:39.161 --> 18:40.815
- We're gonna need another one.

18:40.858 --> 18:43.165
There was no sperm detected
in the semen last time.

18:43.209 --> 18:45.298
- Wait, what do you mean
no sperm?

18:45.341 --> 18:48.562
- Well, we informed Mr. King.
We told him about his options.

18:49.476 --> 18:51.391
- I don't understand.
You called him?

18:51.434 --> 18:53.393
- Yes, of course, Mrs. King.

18:55.221 --> 18:59.442
- Okay. We'll, uh...
Then we'll call you back.

18:59.486 --> 19:03.142
We'll set another time
for him to come in. Thank you
for your time.

19:04.491 --> 19:06.493
- Uh, Mr. King,
I have the results.

19:06.536 --> 19:08.190
- Show me what you got.

19:08.234 --> 19:09.931
- Looks good.

19:11.672 --> 19:13.369
[coughing]

19:17.243 --> 19:19.636
[crying]
- Baby.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.812
Oh, baby.

19:23.336 --> 19:25.512
- I'm so sorry for icing
you out.

19:25.555 --> 19:27.905
- We are not looking back there.

19:27.949 --> 19:32.040
- I'm in quicksand, Mom.
- I believe you, Bridgette,

19:32.083 --> 19:34.782
but how did all that evidence
get in your house?

19:34.825 --> 19:36.218
- I don't know!

19:36.262 --> 19:38.699
- Did anyone else have a key?

19:39.221 --> 19:41.136
- August, but that's it.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.573
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

19:43.617 --> 19:47.316
- God help us out.
You know my child.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.971
She didn't do this.

19:50.014 --> 19:52.234
Find out where that key is.

19:52.278 --> 19:55.629
We have to end this mess.
- Okay.

19:56.978 --> 20:00.155
- Mom, I've looked everywhere.
I can't find it.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.244
[Vanessa]: Honey, look harder.

20:02.288 --> 20:04.246
What if this insane person
shaking us down

20:04.290 --> 20:08.250
stole it from you and planted
the evidence in her apartment?

20:08.294 --> 20:11.122
- I mean... Mom, I gotta go.

20:11.166 --> 20:12.689
You might be right.

20:12.733 --> 20:14.430
Kelvin and I are working
on something,

20:14.474 --> 20:16.563
but I'll fill you in
on the details later, okay?

20:20.262 --> 20:22.743
[rhythmic music]

20:36.322 --> 20:37.584
- You doing alright, August?

20:37.627 --> 20:40.239
[sighing]
- Lots of drama going on.

20:40.456 --> 20:42.284
How about a Manhattan?

20:42.328 --> 20:44.243
- Oh, we're going strong
tonight?

20:44.286 --> 20:46.332
[phone vibrating, chiming]
- Super strong.

20:47.028 --> 20:49.291
You know what, Groesbeck,
scrap the drink.

20:49.335 --> 20:50.727
I'm being stood up.

20:50.771 --> 20:53.556
- Is he crazy?
- He's just swamped.

20:53.600 --> 20:56.211
- Well, at least have some pie.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.300
You never left this place
without having at least

20:58.344 --> 20:59.954
a little bit of
my grandmother's pie.

20:59.997 --> 21:02.826
Plus, it's dead in here so
I sent everyone home.

21:02.870 --> 21:04.219
Keep me company?

21:04.263 --> 21:05.612
- Only if you add ice cream.

21:05.655 --> 21:07.309
- I wouldn't have it
any other way.

21:07.353 --> 21:09.311
[chuckling]
- Thanks.

21:09.355 --> 21:12.271
I'm just gonna run to
the bathroom.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.369
[objects clattering]

21:32.900 --> 21:35.816
- The grey one with the dent
was in your dad's office

21:35.859 --> 21:37.208
in a folder.

21:37.252 --> 21:39.472
- There's a dent,
there's a dent, there's a dent.

21:43.389 --> 21:45.608
Oh, my God. Groesbeck?

21:51.571 --> 21:53.442
- Ready for your pie?

21:57.272 --> 21:58.621
- Yeah.

22:02.059 --> 22:04.453
You know, I think I'm gonna pass
on dessert.

22:05.106 --> 22:06.455
- Why don't you sit down?

22:06.499 --> 22:08.544
- No, I actually have to go.
I'm swamped with work.

22:08.588 --> 22:11.373
- Please. I insist.

22:13.114 --> 22:14.507
- Okay.

22:15.943 --> 22:19.250
- Oh no, you are never meeting
my mom.

22:20.034 --> 22:24.081
- I think I'm the yin to your
yang, Christian.

22:24.430 --> 22:26.388
I'm the north star to the hood.

22:26.432 --> 22:29.391
- I don't need no north star
to the hood.

22:29.435 --> 22:31.611
- I love how you keep it real,
C-Money.

22:31.654 --> 22:33.482
See, you're out here
in these vines

22:33.526 --> 22:35.615
getting swallowed up by
all this bougieness.

22:36.267 --> 22:39.227
But I'm here.
I'm drinking your bourbon,

22:39.270 --> 22:40.837
I'm having your back.

22:40.881 --> 22:43.362
I have some investors I want
to introduce you to.

22:43.405 --> 22:45.407
The Christian Show needs
to lock this up.

22:45.451 --> 22:47.496
- I'll introduce you
to her soon,

22:47.540 --> 22:49.803
but as the baby of
the family,

22:49.846 --> 22:52.327
she always gives my boos
a hard time.

22:52.632 --> 22:55.635
- Well then, maybe I shouldn't
be your boo,

22:56.070 --> 22:57.854
I should be your girl.

22:57.898 --> 22:59.813
[sighing]

23:01.031 --> 23:04.034
- I don't know, my family
is beyond batshit.

23:04.078 --> 23:05.427
They are crazy, girl.

23:05.471 --> 23:07.255
And you don't want none of that.

23:07.298 --> 23:09.649
- I want all of it.

23:15.176 --> 23:17.396
- Thanks, this is so good.

23:18.701 --> 23:21.400
- I made it especially for you.

23:23.489 --> 23:25.491
So...

23:27.406 --> 23:30.060
I see you like my car.

23:30.104 --> 23:31.366
- Yeah.

23:32.367 --> 23:35.370
- It's nice. Reliable.

23:35.414 --> 23:38.068
- Great. Um, you know, my aunt
just woke up at the hospital,

23:38.112 --> 23:40.331
and I should probably--
- Visiting hours are over.

23:40.375 --> 23:42.943
And we've got this whole place
to ourselves.

23:42.986 --> 23:44.771
- Yeah, um...

23:44.814 --> 23:47.513
My dad worked at the hospital,
so I'm sure I can pull some
strings.

23:48.339 --> 23:50.559
- You are a daddy's girl.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.264
- Groesbeck!
[grunting]

24:00.308 --> 24:02.092
[grunting]

24:03.485 --> 24:05.444
[panting]

24:16.411 --> 24:18.195
- Looking fierce.

24:20.676 --> 24:23.592
- Thank you.
- Can you give us a minute?

24:29.555 --> 24:32.906
How 'bout some take-out?
No, delivery.

24:35.430 --> 24:37.954
- I spoke to the fertility
clinic today.

24:37.998 --> 24:39.869
- Oh, good.

24:39.913 --> 24:42.568
- The nurse told me
she called you,

24:42.611 --> 24:44.787
told you about your
sperm count.

24:45.571 --> 24:47.660
You should've told me earlier.

24:47.703 --> 24:49.705
We're gonna get through this.

24:49.749 --> 24:53.535
There are a lot of ways
to improve your count.

24:53.579 --> 24:55.363
Diets, shots...

24:55.755 --> 24:58.497
Technology has really advanced.

24:58.845 --> 25:00.716
- I don't want to have a child.

25:01.587 --> 25:03.893
I made a decision two years ago.

25:06.069 --> 25:08.681
- What exactly happened
two years ago?

25:09.986 --> 25:12.815
Does this have something to do
with your sperm count?

25:17.516 --> 25:19.256
Christ...

25:22.608 --> 25:25.088
Did you have a vasectomy?

25:27.003 --> 25:28.744
Answer me, Dana!

25:28.788 --> 25:31.747
- What if he's like me?
What if he gets teased,

25:31.791 --> 25:34.054
has to grow up and fight
for everything?!

25:34.097 --> 25:37.579
- What if?! Dana, we all go
through things.

25:37.623 --> 25:41.017
Who hasn't had to fight?
But you can't lie!

25:41.061 --> 25:43.890
I thought our relationship
was built on truth!

25:43.933 --> 25:46.414
You let me go through
the whole charade

25:46.457 --> 25:47.850
at the fertility clinic,

25:47.894 --> 25:50.984
taking hormone shots
twice a day!

25:51.027 --> 25:52.551
Why?

25:52.594 --> 25:54.422
- You don't understand.

25:54.465 --> 25:57.817
- Oh. No, you don't.

25:57.860 --> 26:01.081
I put my body through hell.

26:01.124 --> 26:04.737
Were you ever going to tell me
the truth?

26:07.609 --> 26:09.524
- Where the hell are you
going now?

26:09.568 --> 26:11.439
Back to Bridgette,
the Judas?

26:11.482 --> 26:12.788
[chuckling]

26:12.832 --> 26:15.835
I always knew you'd be back down
with the girls.

26:15.878 --> 26:19.795
- You pig. I'm not leaving
because I'm bi

26:19.839 --> 26:21.971
or because I like Bridgette,
I'm leaving

26:22.015 --> 26:23.538
because you're an ass hole,

26:23.582 --> 26:27.020
and you've let your insecurities
blind you.

26:27.063 --> 26:29.239
I love you, Dana.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.546
You were my heart,

26:31.590 --> 26:34.941
my partner, and you lied to me
for years.

26:34.984 --> 26:38.553
That's worse than some stupid
bloody kiss.

26:39.119 --> 26:42.296
- If you try to get out
of this marriage, you'll lose
your job.

26:42.339 --> 26:44.951
It's in my dad's will.
- I don't give a shit.

26:44.994 --> 26:49.433
I'm not bothered by you and
your daddy. Forget you.

26:56.745 --> 26:59.835
[breathing heavily]

27:08.322 --> 27:09.758
- What the hell?

27:09.802 --> 27:11.673
- Surprise, August.

27:11.717 --> 27:13.675
- Why the hell would you
do this?

27:13.719 --> 27:16.678
Making calls?
Framing Bridgette?

27:16.722 --> 27:18.724
She was your friend too.

27:18.767 --> 27:19.855
She's facing jail.

27:19.899 --> 27:22.205
- "Why" is always the question.

27:22.249 --> 27:24.164
Your dad was willing
to pay anything to keep me

27:24.207 --> 27:26.688
from poisoning your vines.
Plus, you made it too easy.

27:26.732 --> 27:30.213
Single girls should never
sleep with their windows open.

27:30.736 --> 27:32.651
- You broke into my house.

27:33.129 --> 27:36.393
You were the man in the darkness
at the money drop.

27:36.437 --> 27:38.744
- I cloned her cell.

27:40.615 --> 27:43.792
So much for family.
- So much for friends!

27:44.445 --> 27:46.577
My family was good to you.

27:46.621 --> 27:47.840
[scoffing]

27:47.883 --> 27:49.842
- You call what you did to
my family "good"?

27:49.885 --> 27:51.844
- My father bought your land.

27:51.887 --> 27:54.760
Bailed your grandparents out.
- Your father stole it.

27:54.803 --> 27:58.067
That was supposed to be my dad's
inheritance. Our legacy.

27:58.111 --> 28:00.722
He only sold it to your dad
to spite mine,

28:00.766 --> 28:03.072
and now we have nothing.
- That's not our fault.

28:03.116 --> 28:05.422
- It's all your fault.
You know what your dad did.

28:05.466 --> 28:08.425
- Groesbeck.
- He fleeced my grandfather.

28:08.904 --> 28:10.776
He made him think he was
some poor,

28:10.819 --> 28:13.517
struggling "brutha"
from Oakland.

28:13.779 --> 28:16.738
Poor, my ass.
But once the ink's dry,

28:16.782 --> 28:19.349
we find out he's head
of neurology at the hospital.

28:19.393 --> 28:21.612
- He was a business man.
- He played us.

28:21.656 --> 28:23.571
- No. You assumed,

28:23.614 --> 28:26.226
because he was Black,
he was nothing.

28:26.748 --> 28:32.493
- My grandfather could've sold
that land to anybody.

28:32.798 --> 28:34.582
But he made a deal with
your dad.

28:34.625 --> 28:37.150
And how did he repay him, hmm?

28:37.193 --> 28:39.587
He sat on the land
for two years,

28:39.630 --> 28:43.547
and then he flipped a parcel
to Sean & Shawn!

28:43.591 --> 28:47.377
And now all of you have empires.

28:48.770 --> 28:52.905
And I am sitting on a pile
of shit.

28:53.819 --> 28:55.037
- So you're jealous.

28:55.081 --> 28:57.692
You're jealous that we have
a company,

28:57.736 --> 28:59.302
and you just run this place.

28:59.346 --> 29:02.175
- My family's owned land in this
country for over 100 years.

29:02.479 --> 29:04.960
I tried to buy a piece back
right before COVID.

29:05.004 --> 29:06.788
You know what the good doctor
said to me?

29:08.137 --> 29:11.532
Nothing. He laughed in my face.

29:11.575 --> 29:13.795
- Because you probably didn't
have the money.

29:13.839 --> 29:15.623
- Because of him.

29:15.666 --> 29:18.539
- No, because your grandfather
sold too early,

29:18.582 --> 29:19.758
and didn't see the long game.

29:19.801 --> 29:23.065
- You do not get to talk to me
like that!

29:23.849 --> 29:25.720
Do you know who I am?

29:25.764 --> 29:28.070
Do you know who my family was?!

29:28.114 --> 29:30.203
We're not getting played by
a bunch of--

29:30.246 --> 29:33.293
- A bunch of what?
What, say it!

29:33.336 --> 29:36.644
Say it, you dick!
A bunch of what?

29:37.253 --> 29:40.909
- A bunch of people...
- Mm-hmm.

29:40.953 --> 29:45.392
- ...who have no history here.

29:46.349 --> 29:49.526
This was ours.
This is our blood.

29:49.570 --> 29:51.877
- This is my family's dream.

29:52.486 --> 29:55.619
And you don't get to walk up
to a Black man

29:55.663 --> 29:58.709
and take his land,
like this is Central Park,

29:58.753 --> 30:01.234
or Bruce Beach,
or Black Wall Street,

30:01.277 --> 30:04.411
or the whole goddamn country,
for that matter!

30:04.454 --> 30:06.369
It's our blood and sweat

30:06.413 --> 30:08.328
that cultivated all
of this land.

30:08.371 --> 30:11.679
So, unless you're on
the reparations committee, no.

30:11.722 --> 30:14.377
Your white privileged ass

30:14.421 --> 30:16.815
doesn't get to make an
about face and reclaim something

30:16.858 --> 30:20.079
that we have worked our asses
off for decades.

30:20.122 --> 30:22.429
And my father laughed at you?

30:22.777 --> 30:26.781
I don't care.
I am laughing at you too.

30:27.782 --> 30:29.828
We are kings.

30:30.132 --> 30:31.873
And you better recognize it.

30:31.917 --> 30:33.744
[grunting]

30:35.921 --> 30:38.967
- I thought milking you
for money was going to make
me feel better,

30:39.011 --> 30:40.882
but the only thing
that's gonna do that

30:40.926 --> 30:43.189
is if I get rid of the one thing
your daddy loved most,

30:43.232 --> 30:46.757
his little angel.
I hope you liked your pie.

30:46.801 --> 30:48.368
[grunting]

30:48.411 --> 30:50.065
[glass shattering]

30:50.500 --> 30:52.154
[shouting]

30:53.852 --> 30:55.331
[grunting]

31:02.121 --> 31:04.732
[Kelvin]: August, August!
- We're here.

31:04.775 --> 31:06.908
- August, August!

31:06.952 --> 31:08.910
[screaming]

31:08.954 --> 31:10.259
[thudding]
- That's for my father,

31:10.303 --> 31:12.348
you entitled piece of shit!

31:12.914 --> 31:15.699
- Hey, hey.

31:17.745 --> 31:19.312
- This guy's not going anywhere.

31:19.355 --> 31:21.183
- You okay?
- Yeah.

31:26.841 --> 31:28.799
[insects chirping]

31:29.496 --> 31:31.715
- He could've killed me.
- Baby.

31:31.759 --> 31:33.935
- Oh, God.
- But he didn't.

31:33.979 --> 31:36.807
- I just can't believe I blamed
Bridgette.

31:37.852 --> 31:42.248
I was going to let her go to
jail, and he did this.

31:43.814 --> 31:47.166
What if I lose her for good?
- You won't.

31:47.209 --> 31:50.909
- But how do I fix this
with her?

31:52.998 --> 31:54.913
- You'll figure it out.

31:56.827 --> 31:59.700
[upbeat music]

32:03.269 --> 32:06.489
- Okay. Everyone's tried
Grace's blend?

32:06.968 --> 32:08.839
How are you feeling?

32:09.101 --> 32:12.974
- It's nice, it has a delicious
hint of floral.

32:13.018 --> 32:14.584
- Dana, what do you think?

32:15.498 --> 32:17.065
- It's fine.

32:18.023 --> 32:21.243
- I think it's bomb, sis.
- Holla.

32:21.287 --> 32:22.897
If I had this
on the Sinbad cruise,

32:22.941 --> 32:25.378
I'd have five babies by now.

32:25.421 --> 32:26.640
[laughing]

32:27.641 --> 32:29.599
- You know,
I think Dana's right.

32:29.643 --> 32:30.774
I think it needs a twist.

32:31.297 --> 32:33.212
- I've got an idea for that.

32:33.255 --> 32:36.171
- Bridgette, you're back!

32:41.263 --> 32:43.787
- What? You dropped
the charges

32:43.831 --> 32:46.703
and expect me to just wander off
into the sunset?

32:46.747 --> 32:49.880
My father wanted me here,
so I'm staying,

32:49.924 --> 32:51.708
regardless of what happened.

32:51.752 --> 32:54.842
- We are so glad that
you are back, Bridgette.

32:54.885 --> 32:57.366
- And we are sorry,

32:57.410 --> 32:59.803
for everything that we put
you through.

33:01.240 --> 33:04.678
I tried calling.
I didn't know if you'd return.

33:04.721 --> 33:06.288
- I'm here.

33:06.332 --> 33:08.638
- Good, so,
why don't you tell us

33:08.682 --> 33:11.076
what's in that brilliant
brain of yours?

33:11.424 --> 33:15.036
- I'll only tell you
if you make me vice president.

33:15.080 --> 33:18.561
- What? You can't just
waltz back in here demanding
a promotion.

33:18.605 --> 33:19.780
- Sure I can.

33:20.911 --> 33:22.435
Twenty percent raise too.

33:22.478 --> 33:27.005
- It's worth considering, if
your idea kicks us up a notch.

33:28.180 --> 33:32.053
- I say we use my hybrid
grapes growing in the back
of the vineyard.

33:32.097 --> 33:33.185
- That's a great idea.

33:33.228 --> 33:35.839
- Okay. But we still need
a little kick.

33:35.883 --> 33:38.233
- Maybe we ferment it
with something.

33:38.277 --> 33:40.018
- What if we use
my bourbon barrels.

33:40.061 --> 33:41.802
[laughing]
- That's the ticket.

33:41.845 --> 33:45.066
- Finally, your "Show Stoppa"
hooch comes in use.

33:45.110 --> 33:47.286
[laughing]
Way to sink the three.

33:47.329 --> 33:49.244
- Okay, so we're gonna need
to make a big PR splash

33:49.288 --> 33:51.681
to upstage the Shawns.
We don't have Rose.

33:51.725 --> 33:54.032
- Well,
I will call the PR company,

33:54.075 --> 33:56.251
and I'll get them
to put me on the Midday Show

33:56.295 --> 33:57.861
because we have something
to sell.

33:57.905 --> 34:00.951
- Okay! Okay, good, good!

34:00.995 --> 34:03.737
And let's not forget about
getting another distributor.

34:03.780 --> 34:06.174
- Let me talk to Jason.
With all this new spin,

34:06.218 --> 34:09.960
maybe I can persuade him
to give us a redo.

34:10.004 --> 34:11.701
[laughing]

34:31.156 --> 34:33.201
- Wow. This sample is good.

34:33.245 --> 34:35.029
I can taste the bourbon in here.

34:35.073 --> 34:36.291
- Holla.

34:36.335 --> 34:39.120
- It's very smooth. Sweet.

34:40.469 --> 34:43.385
I only agreed to have another
tasting with your group

34:43.429 --> 34:45.648
because Jason swore
your new wine was better

34:45.692 --> 34:47.955
than Sean & Shawn's cheaper
version.

34:49.478 --> 34:51.350
He was right.
This is wonderful.

34:51.393 --> 34:53.221
We want to distribute this one.

34:54.004 --> 34:57.007
- Well, we can have our bottles
ready in four months,

34:57.051 --> 34:58.226
on one condition.

34:58.270 --> 35:00.402
You drop Sean & Shawn's
cheap wine,

35:00.446 --> 35:03.144
and you deal with us
exclusively.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.495
- That's fine.

35:07.757 --> 35:09.150
- You've got a deal.

35:09.194 --> 35:11.370
Those two were starting to get
on my nerves anyway.

35:11.413 --> 35:13.981
That one Shawn is so extra.

35:14.286 --> 35:16.549
- You better werq, bitch.

35:16.592 --> 35:18.072
[laughing]

35:18.116 --> 35:20.727
[rhythmic music]

35:22.990 --> 35:25.166
- This bourbon's dope, man.

35:25.210 --> 35:26.428
- I be doing my thing.

35:26.472 --> 35:29.039
- Cornelius, my baby's looking
for investors,

35:29.083 --> 35:31.259
and I know when I used to temp
for y'all back in the day,

35:31.303 --> 35:34.262
y'all were funding
all types of things. So?

35:35.959 --> 35:37.613
Whatchu think?

35:38.136 --> 35:40.529
- We in.
- You serious?

35:40.573 --> 35:42.966
- We know money when we see it.

35:46.231 --> 35:49.582
- My brother.
- You know what it is.

35:50.235 --> 35:51.801
- Appreciate you.

35:51.845 --> 35:55.153
- My pleasure.
- Grab some more drinks,
enjoy yourself.

35:55.196 --> 35:56.676
The place is yours.

35:59.635 --> 36:02.377
- I told you I was your north
star, baby.

36:03.248 --> 36:07.034
- Look at me now, Pop.
Your boy's about to shine.

36:08.992 --> 36:10.733
- I talked to the doctor.

36:10.777 --> 36:13.867
He said there's a clinical trial
that you might be eligible for.

36:13.910 --> 36:17.044
- Mmm. I just want to take
some herbs and get out of here.

36:17.087 --> 36:20.178
- No! That thing almost
killed you!

36:20.221 --> 36:21.614
[coughing]

36:21.657 --> 36:23.746
Okay, let me get you some tea.

36:32.277 --> 36:34.192
Who told you I was here?

36:34.235 --> 36:37.282
- Your cleaning lady gave it up
pretty quickly.

36:37.325 --> 36:39.501
Look, I tried to call you.

36:39.545 --> 36:42.156
Now that you're out
of the woods,

36:42.461 --> 36:45.681
Frieze wants you
in the New York fair.

36:45.725 --> 36:48.728
- So, you're back to being
my gallerist?

36:48.771 --> 36:51.731
- I needed to give us
some space.

36:52.297 --> 36:53.950
What do you say?

36:54.951 --> 36:57.519
- I say I don't want a rep
who's sometimey.

36:57.563 --> 37:00.914
Tell Frieze I'll call them
on my own.

37:00.957 --> 37:02.481
- You're making a mistake,
Bridgette.

37:02.524 --> 37:05.179
- Or I'm making room
for a better opportunity.

37:10.184 --> 37:11.925
[sighing]

37:21.543 --> 37:23.284
- Hey.

37:23.328 --> 37:25.112
We got our distribution
deal back,

37:25.155 --> 37:27.593
so you're gonna get that
promotion.

37:28.985 --> 37:30.465
Congratulations.

37:31.074 --> 37:32.119
- Thanks.

37:33.381 --> 37:36.166
- Bridge, I'm really sorry
about all of this.

37:36.210 --> 37:38.473
About going after you and...

37:39.039 --> 37:40.432
how can I fix this?

37:40.475 --> 37:46.089
- August, we've been through
a lot since Dad's death.

37:46.133 --> 37:49.223
And I will always love you.

37:49.441 --> 37:52.139
But I can't deal
with your antics anymore.

37:53.140 --> 37:56.186
We need to keep this strictly
a business relationship.

37:56.230 --> 38:00.713
Focus on making
the company the biggest
vineyard in the world.

38:01.583 --> 38:04.194
- Hmm.
- Now, let's face it.

38:04.238 --> 38:07.285
If you were a true sister
or my friend,

38:07.633 --> 38:09.591
none of this would've happened.

38:09.635 --> 38:14.030
- Bridge. What happened to us?

38:14.640 --> 38:16.772
We used to share everything.

38:16.816 --> 38:20.123
- Listen,
clearly we're at an impasse,

38:20.472 --> 38:25.128
so let's just draw some
boundaries today, right now.

38:25.651 --> 38:28.436
I will see you at work.

38:48.413 --> 38:51.198
- Wow! Isn't this a little soon?

38:51.241 --> 38:53.287
- We're too old to wait.

38:54.593 --> 38:56.856
What do you say, Yvette?

38:59.511 --> 39:01.600
[phone vibrating]

39:32.021 --> 39:34.937
- Rose, come on.
Pick up the phone.

39:39.246 --> 39:42.292
Please. I'm begging you.

39:43.424 --> 39:45.383
[phone vibrating]

39:47.428 --> 39:49.256
- What are you doing?

39:49.299 --> 39:51.519
- There's something we share.

39:52.259 --> 39:54.392
When Dana and I had our dustup,

39:54.914 --> 39:57.395
none of the family reached out
to me.

39:57.438 --> 39:59.440
They didn't call.

39:59.484 --> 40:01.790
They treated me just like
they did you.

40:01.834 --> 40:04.358
And Dana deceived me for years.

40:04.402 --> 40:05.751
I put in time there.

40:05.794 --> 40:08.188
They can't just write me off.

40:09.494 --> 40:10.799
We're family,
for Christ's sake.

40:10.843 --> 40:13.541
- Rose, you can't go down
this road.

40:13.585 --> 40:15.064
- It's too late for that.

40:15.108 --> 40:17.327
I know where all the skeletons
are.

40:17.371 --> 40:19.155
You want to get dirty?

40:24.030 --> 40:27.120
[rhythmic music]

40:37.522 --> 40:39.524
- You must be
the new pool boy.

40:39.567 --> 40:41.830
We like staff to enter
to the side.

40:41.874 --> 40:42.918
[chuckling]

40:42.962 --> 40:44.572
- I'm actually
your new neighbour.

40:44.616 --> 40:46.748
I just bought
Sean & Shawn's.

40:46.792 --> 40:49.098
- Oh! So you're a winemaker.

40:49.142 --> 40:52.145
- Eh, I'm a hotelier.

40:52.972 --> 40:56.497
My business partner and I
are buying up a few vineyards,

40:56.541 --> 40:58.804
and then putting
in a five-star resort.

40:58.847 --> 41:01.807
- This land can't be used
for commercial monstrosities.

41:01.850 --> 41:03.939
[laughing]

41:03.983 --> 41:07.073
- Well, money changes
everything.

41:07.116 --> 41:11.599
If anyone should know that,
you should, Vanessa King.

41:14.559 --> 41:16.169
Talk soon?

41:16.212 --> 41:17.649
- Perhaps.

41:19.825 --> 41:23.655
- I'd love to taste your wine,
yeah?

41:32.141 --> 41:33.708
- A-August?

41:34.753 --> 41:37.538
August, we have a problem.

41:37.582 --> 41:39.453
[birds chirping]

41:44.589 --> 41:48.462
[rhythmic music]

42:04.434 --> 42:06.436
[tense music]
