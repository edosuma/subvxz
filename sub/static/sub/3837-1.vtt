00:30.656 --> 00:32.825
Dr. Gruber!

00:35.453 --> 00:39.165
<i>Doctor!</i>

00:39.248 --> 00:40.416
<i>Mr. West!</i>

00:44.295 --> 00:45.629
<i>Mr. West!</i>

00:45.713 --> 00:46.839
<i>Get out!</i>

00:50.134 --> 00:52.053
<i>Move back.</i>

01:07.318 --> 01:08.903
My god.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.326
You idiots!
You'll ruin my notes.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.828
I have to record
his vital signs!

01:17.912 --> 01:19.205
No! No!

01:21.707 --> 01:22.625
Dr. Gruber?

01:22.708 --> 01:25.336
<i>Dr. Gruber, How this happened?</i>

01:30.424 --> 01:31.675
Dr. Gruber?

01:48.025 --> 01:49.819
<i>He's dead.</i>

01:49.902 --> 01:53.364
Of course, he's dead,
the dosage was too large.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.323
You killed him.

01:54.406 --> 01:56.826
No, I did not.

01:57.993 --> 02:00.621
I gave him life.

04:52.001 --> 04:54.336
All right,
I'm gonna zap her again.

04:54.420 --> 04:57.172
Charge up the paddles.

04:57.298 --> 04:58.215
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

04:58.299 --> 05:00.134
Sorry, doctor.

05:00.217 --> 05:03.178
Hold the compressions.

05:03.304 --> 05:05.139
Clear!

05:08.517 --> 05:10.978
Straight line.

05:12.563 --> 05:15.858
All right, let's call it.

05:15.941 --> 05:16.775
Cain.

05:16.859 --> 05:19.987
She just needs a little more time
for the drugs to circulate.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.697
Cain, we have done everything

05:21.780 --> 05:23.741
that can be done for this woman.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.701
She has not responded.

05:28.370 --> 05:29.913
She's gone!

05:41.258 --> 05:43.635
Cain, your optimism is touching,
but a waste of time.

05:43.719 --> 05:45.888
A good doctor
knows when to stop.

05:45.971 --> 05:46.889
- Dr. Harrod, just...
- Take her.

05:46.972 --> 05:50.100
And take her to the morgue.

05:52.770 --> 05:54.938
Gangway...

06:05.366 --> 06:06.533
Mr. Cain.

06:06.617 --> 06:07.868
Hey, Mace!

06:07.951 --> 06:09.203
I got another one for you.

06:09.286 --> 06:12.289
They ain't locked.
Doc Hill's in the autopsy room.

06:12.373 --> 06:14.541
Oh, thanks.

06:14.625 --> 06:16.752
Don't know why they keep
locked doors around here.

06:16.835 --> 06:19.254
Nobody wants in...

06:19.380 --> 06:21.006
and ain't nobody gettin' out.

06:21.090 --> 06:23.884
Yup.

06:51.620 --> 06:55.124
Full house.

07:50.095 --> 07:52.181
Oh, I'm sorry, Dan.
I didn't mean to scare you.

07:52.264 --> 07:53.348
Oh, it wasn't too bad
Dean Halsey.

07:53.474 --> 07:55.100
I just didn't know anybody was here.

07:55.184 --> 07:57.144
You mean, "anybody else".

07:57.227 --> 07:58.645
Dan, this is Herbert West.

07:58.729 --> 08:00.355
He'll be joining you
in your third year.

08:00.481 --> 08:02.316
He was doing independent
research in Switzerland

08:02.399 --> 08:04.193
with Dr. Gruber shortly before he died.

08:04.276 --> 08:06.653
Mr. West, this is Daniel Cain.

08:06.737 --> 08:08.071
(One of Miskatonic Medical's

08:08.155 --> 08:11.366
best young hopes
for the future of medicine.

08:11.492 --> 08:12.784
What were you researching?

08:12.868 --> 08:14.244
Death.

08:14.328 --> 08:17.331
Alan, we don't see you
around here much anymore.

08:17.414 --> 08:19.333
Well, I was just showing
our newest student,

08:19.416 --> 08:21.335
Herbert West here,
the not-so-grand tour.

08:21.418 --> 08:23.295
This should interest you, Carl.

08:23.378 --> 08:26.965
He worked with Hans Gruber.

08:27.049 --> 08:28.675
Mr. West?

08:28.759 --> 08:34.431
This is our eminent brain researcher
and grant machine, Dr. Carl Hill.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.517
I know your work, Dr. Hill.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.352
Quite well.

08:38.434 --> 08:40.729
Your theory on the location
of the will in the brain is...

08:40.812 --> 08:43.190
interesting...

08:43.273 --> 08:46.735
though derivative of Dr. Gruber's
research in the early '70s.

08:46.818 --> 08:50.113
So derivative, in fact, that in Europe
it's considered plagiarized.

08:50.197 --> 08:54.076
And your support of the 12-minute limit on
the life of the brain stem after death...

08:54.159 --> 08:57.079
Six to 12 minutes, Mr...

08:57.162 --> 08:59.998
West. Herbert West.

09:00.082 --> 09:03.168
Frankly, Dr. Hill?

09:03.252 --> 09:05.587
Your work on brain death
is outdated.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.801
Carl, while I remember,

09:10.884 --> 09:13.387
we're having a grant committee
meeting Thursday.

09:13.470 --> 09:16.014
Megan and I would love it
if you came to dinner.

09:16.098 --> 09:17.307
Well, I'd love to, Alan,

09:17.391 --> 09:19.393
looking forward to it.

09:19.476 --> 09:23.146
And looking forward to
seeing you in class, Mr. West.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.791
Hi.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.379
No. No.

09:48.880 --> 09:53.594
Yes! Oh, yes!

10:09.443 --> 10:12.029
Rufus!

10:12.112 --> 10:14.239
Thanks a lot, buddy.

10:14.323 --> 10:16.325
I have to go.

10:19.369 --> 10:21.204
No, stay.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.789
Daddy knows I'm here.

10:22.873 --> 10:24.625
I don't care
what Dean Halsey knows.

10:24.708 --> 10:26.793
Be reasonable.

10:26.877 --> 10:29.046
If I didn't come home
one night...

10:29.129 --> 10:30.797
just one night...

10:30.881 --> 10:32.799
What would he do?

10:32.883 --> 10:34.551
Expel me?

10:34.635 --> 10:36.803
He's out of touch with the times.

10:36.887 --> 10:38.555
That's just the way he is,

10:38.639 --> 10:41.099
the world's last living Puritan.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.146
I really hate it.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.445
The day that you graduate,

10:53.528 --> 10:57.115
the minute you get your M.D.,
I'll marry you,

10:57.199 --> 11:00.827
and I'll help you, and I'll be with you

11:00.911 --> 11:03.580
as much as I can until then.

11:03.664 --> 11:06.958
I promise.

11:07.042 --> 11:09.294
Back to square one.

11:09.378 --> 11:12.881
Well, at least it gives me
a chance to housebreak you.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.802
Housebroken, is it?

11:22.683 --> 11:25.977
I'm going to have to teach
you a lesson, my girl.

11:26.061 --> 11:28.021
What are you doing?

11:28.105 --> 11:31.858
Dan.

11:31.942 --> 11:34.986
Dan... stop, don't.

11:36.154 --> 11:37.614
Dan, stop it!

11:37.698 --> 11:38.865
Come, my pretty.

11:38.949 --> 11:41.618
Dan, I don't like that.

11:41.702 --> 11:45.872
There's not a jury in the world
that would convict me.

11:45.956 --> 11:47.624
Dan, stop it!

11:47.708 --> 11:49.626
Doctor Dan!

11:49.710 --> 11:52.879
Dan, don't, come on, stop.

11:52.963 --> 11:54.047
I really have to go.

11:54.131 --> 11:55.590
Come here! Come to me.

11:55.716 --> 11:57.718
- Oh.
- What?

11:59.761 --> 12:01.805
Oh, shit.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.056
Hi.

12:03.140 --> 12:05.559
Can I help you?

12:05.642 --> 12:07.144
You're
here about the apartment.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.604
Yes.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.815
Didn't we meet this morning?
You're...

12:11.898 --> 12:13.775
West. Herbert West.

12:13.859 --> 12:16.361
Excuse me just one sec.

12:19.531 --> 12:20.574
Come in.

12:20.657 --> 12:22.868
Thank you.

12:28.290 --> 12:29.541
I startled you.

12:29.624 --> 12:31.752
Yes, you did.

12:33.545 --> 12:37.215
May I introduce my fiancÃ©e,
Megan Halsey?

12:37.299 --> 12:40.469
- Miss Halsey.
- Mr. West.

12:40.552 --> 12:42.763
I'm afraid the place is still
kind of a mess, Mr. West.

12:42.846 --> 12:45.140
Oh... Herbert.

12:56.026 --> 12:58.695
So, you've
just come from Europe?

12:58.779 --> 13:01.198
Switzerland.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.617
What was Dr. Gruber like?
He was pretty famous.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.243
Yes, pretty famous...

13:05.327 --> 13:07.871
Does this building
have a basement?

13:12.292 --> 13:14.377
Oh, yes.

13:17.839 --> 13:20.300
Yes.

13:20.383 --> 13:23.178
I think this will be just fine.

13:23.261 --> 13:25.597
I have my things outside,
shall I move in now?

13:25.680 --> 13:28.725
Look, I have to go.

13:28.809 --> 13:30.936
I think you and Mr. West
have a lot to discuss

13:31.019 --> 13:32.354
before you decide anything.

13:32.437 --> 13:35.440
Oh, I've decided.

13:35.524 --> 13:36.733
Well, I'd like-â€”

13:36.817 --> 13:38.819
You know, you'll never even
know that I'm here.

13:38.902 --> 13:39.736
Dan, I...

13:39.820 --> 13:40.987
Except, of course,
on the first of the month.

13:41.071 --> 13:42.614
Mr. West?

13:42.697 --> 13:43.990
Miss Halsey?

13:44.074 --> 13:47.994
You didn't say why
you left Switzerland.

13:48.078 --> 13:52.082
There was no more
I could learn there.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.921
Do we... have a deal?

14:03.593 --> 14:05.011
Done.

14:06.429 --> 14:08.765
Done.

14:08.849 --> 14:13.061
You make the incision
at the base of the skull...

14:26.867 --> 14:29.536
cutting away
enough of the faschia...

14:32.581 --> 14:34.457
to get your fingers in...

14:37.711 --> 14:41.715
and then grasping firmly
with both hands,

14:41.798 --> 14:46.887
you pull the skin forward
over the head,

14:48.013 --> 14:50.974
very much like peeling
a large orange.

14:52.893 --> 14:58.440
Once the skull is plainly visible,

14:58.523 --> 15:01.651
you take the bone saw...

15:02.903 --> 15:04.905
And you cut around the perimeter.

15:17.918 --> 15:21.421
And there you have it,
ladies and gentlemen,

15:21.504 --> 15:23.798
the human brain.

15:23.924 --> 15:26.593
Once the brain stem
of an individual,

15:26.676 --> 15:29.679
I'm talking about the reticular
activating system,

15:29.763 --> 15:32.307
heart regulation,
respiratory center.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.851
Once these activities cease,

15:34.935 --> 15:40.231
the brain can only survive
an additional six to 12 minutes.

15:40.315 --> 15:43.193
Six to 12 minutes.

15:45.278 --> 15:48.239
Until...

15:48.323 --> 15:52.869
brain death brings about
an irreversible conclusion.

16:01.544 --> 16:05.548
We all want to retain
our personalities

16:05.632 --> 16:07.801
in some idyllic afterlife.

16:07.884 --> 16:10.720
We all pray for some miracle,

16:10.804 --> 16:14.432
some drug, potion, pill.

16:20.230 --> 16:25.151
Perhaps, though,
it takes something else.

16:25.235 --> 16:29.698
Perhaps it takes desire,
an obsessive desire.

16:29.781 --> 16:32.200
Perhaps it ta...

16:37.664 --> 16:41.876
We will discuss the location of the will
in the brain structure

16:42.002 --> 16:45.296
at another time.

16:45.380 --> 16:47.465
Mr. West!

16:47.549 --> 16:50.885
I suggest you get
yourself a pen!

16:52.721 --> 16:54.139
Class dismissed.

16:56.641 --> 16:58.226
How can you teach such drivel?

16:58.309 --> 17:00.270
These people are here to learn
and you're closing their minds

17:00.353 --> 17:01.521
before they even have a chance!

17:01.604 --> 17:03.023
What are you here for,
Mr. West?

17:03.064 --> 17:05.025
You know, you should have
stolen more of Gruber's ideas,

17:05.066 --> 17:06.443
then at least you'd have ideas!

17:06.526 --> 17:08.528
Mr. West!

17:11.281 --> 17:14.159
It is going to be
a pleasure to fail you.

17:21.374 --> 17:25.377
I would like to propose a toast

17:25.462 --> 17:27.589
to the National Science Foundation

17:27.672 --> 17:31.926
for recognizing the genius
of Dr. Carl Hill,

17:32.927 --> 17:36.056
and for awarding
Miskatonic Medical School

17:36.097 --> 17:37.682
its largest grant ever.

17:39.059 --> 17:43.229
Your new laser drill is going
to revolutionize neurosurgery.

17:43.313 --> 17:47.942
To the foundation,
and to Miskatonic.

17:51.321 --> 17:52.864
It's all right, sweetheart,
you can drink up.

17:52.947 --> 17:53.990
We're celebrating.

17:54.074 --> 17:56.159
I know, Daddy,
but I have to go soon.

17:56.242 --> 17:59.954
After preparing such a feast,
you must be tired.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.706
I have a study date.

18:01.790 --> 18:03.166
With Daniel?

18:03.249 --> 18:04.834
Yeah.

18:04.918 --> 18:06.169
Daniel Cain'?

18:07.629 --> 18:10.632
Herbert West has moved in
with him, hasn't he?

18:10.715 --> 18:12.383
For the time being.

18:13.468 --> 18:15.345
That must be him
Excuse me.

18:19.599 --> 18:22.435
So, your daughter
is seeing Cain, eh?

18:24.270 --> 18:27.273
You think that's wise, Alan'?

18:27.357 --> 18:28.483
Dan!

18:28.566 --> 18:30.235
Hello, sir.

18:30.318 --> 18:31.945
Dr. Hill.

18:32.028 --> 18:33.988
Would you join us
for a glass of wine?

18:35.865 --> 18:37.742
Actually, we have some
work to do.

18:37.826 --> 18:39.285
Why don't you study here?

18:39.369 --> 18:42.789
Well, I've her home soon,
don't worry.

18:42.872 --> 18:47.127
Well then, one last toast?

18:48.711 --> 18:50.547
To Megan...

18:50.630 --> 18:54.676
my esteemed colleague's capable,

18:54.759 --> 18:58.263
beautiful, loving daughter,

18:58.346 --> 19:01.474
the obsession of all
who fall under her spell.

19:17.323 --> 19:19.325
Dan.

19:19.409 --> 19:21.870
No.

19:21.953 --> 19:24.664
Please!

19:24.747 --> 19:25.832
Okay, what is it?

19:25.915 --> 19:27.792
I don't know, it's...

19:27.876 --> 19:31.045
Look, it's not you, really.

19:31.171 --> 19:33.298
It's just a lot of little things.

19:33.381 --> 19:35.049
Like what?

19:35.175 --> 19:37.719
Well, West is always in his room
with the door closed.

19:37.802 --> 19:39.762
I mean, do you ever see him?

19:39.846 --> 19:41.347
Does he ever eat?

19:41.431 --> 19:43.975
I told you, he's a little cracked.

19:45.810 --> 19:48.646
He bothers you, too.

19:48.730 --> 19:50.857
No, don't be ridiculous.

19:50.940 --> 19:52.525
Rufus is terrified of him.

19:52.609 --> 19:54.068
When West comes in,
he runs and hides.

19:54.194 --> 19:55.987
Rufus hides
and runs all the time,

19:56.070 --> 19:57.363
it's standard cat activity.

19:57.447 --> 19:58.448
Yes, but not when we're together,

19:58.531 --> 20:00.491
then he's all over us trying
to get your attention and...

20:01.993 --> 20:03.578
Where is he?

20:03.661 --> 20:05.079
I haven't seen him
since we got here.

20:05.205 --> 20:06.372
It's okay, he's around here.

20:06.456 --> 20:07.457
I haven't even heard him,

20:07.540 --> 20:10.210
usually he at least knocks
something over when I'm here.

20:12.629 --> 20:14.756
Pss pss pss pss.

20:16.466 --> 20:19.260
Rufus... Rufus... Rufus.

20:19.344 --> 20:20.470
Pss pss pss pss.

20:20.553 --> 20:24.057
Come on, you fat cat.

20:24.140 --> 20:25.600
Here, kitty!

20:25.683 --> 20:27.393
Rufus.

20:27.477 --> 20:29.812
Come on now, you mad animal.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.856
Don't you try to hide from me.

20:31.940 --> 20:34.400
I know all of your tricks.

20:34.484 --> 20:37.403
Rufus? Where are you, boy?

20:37.487 --> 20:39.405
Here, kitty.

20:39.489 --> 20:41.532
Here, kitty!

20:43.243 --> 20:44.577
Here, kitty.

20:49.832 --> 20:53.503
Rufus. Hey, boy!

21:05.098 --> 21:07.725
Rufus?

21:11.271 --> 21:14.023
Rufus?

21:15.984 --> 21:17.819
Rufus.

21:23.741 --> 21:26.494
Rufus?

21:34.335 --> 21:35.420
Hey, boy.

21:42.552 --> 21:44.637
Rufus, are you in here?

21:49.684 --> 21:52.520
Here, boy.

21:52.603 --> 21:54.564
Here, kitty.

22:07.201 --> 22:10.538
Rufus?

22:15.668 --> 22:18.129
Oh, Dan, I think it's...

22:18.212 --> 22:19.839
What are you doing in my room?

22:19.922 --> 22:21.341
- How dare you come in...
- Dan!

22:23.509 --> 22:25.261
What's the matter?
What's the matter?

22:25.345 --> 22:27.889
I thought I was renting
a private room, Dan!

22:27.972 --> 22:29.140
Meg, what the hell
are you doing in here?

22:29.223 --> 22:31.100
- I...
- Would you please leave, now!

22:31.184 --> 22:33.353
Easy!

22:33.436 --> 22:34.645
In the fridge.

22:44.947 --> 22:46.699
I was going to show you.

22:46.783 --> 22:48.785
Shut up.

22:53.831 --> 22:55.541
What happened?

22:55.625 --> 22:58.669
It was dead when I found it.

22:58.753 --> 23:00.755
You killed him.

23:00.838 --> 23:02.548
He hated you!

23:02.632 --> 23:05.426
Meg. It suffocated.

23:08.846 --> 23:12.558
It knocked the garbage over and
it got its head stuck in a jar.

23:12.642 --> 23:14.560
You weren't home,
so I put it in there.

23:14.644 --> 23:16.270
I certainly didn't think
you'd want to find it like that.

23:16.396 --> 23:18.189
I didn't want
to stink the place up.

23:18.272 --> 23:20.233
I was going to show you.

23:20.316 --> 23:21.901
You couldn't call, or write a note?

23:21.984 --> 23:24.028
I was busy pushing bodies around,
as you well know,

23:24.112 --> 23:25.405
and what would a note say, Dan?

23:25.446 --> 23:27.907
"Cat dead, details later"?

23:27.990 --> 23:29.033
I knew you were fond of it.

23:29.117 --> 23:30.284
You killed him, I know you did.

23:30.410 --> 23:31.285
He killed him.

23:31.411 --> 23:32.912
Besides, I do not
like people in my room!

23:32.995 --> 23:35.665
All right, that's enough.

23:42.588 --> 23:44.257
I think you both better leave, now.

23:44.340 --> 23:45.341
What the hell is this?

23:45.425 --> 23:46.551
That is none of your business.

23:46.634 --> 23:47.677
Yeah, I think it is my business!

23:47.760 --> 23:48.803
Just as it is none of my business

23:48.886 --> 23:50.513
that you're sleeping
with Dean Halsey's daughter.

23:54.058 --> 23:55.601
You know, I would not want
to see a fellow student,

23:55.685 --> 23:57.437
especially one
as promising as yourself,

23:57.478 --> 23:59.814
be thrown out of school,
out of the profession...

23:59.897 --> 24:03.443
on moral ground.

24:03.484 --> 24:05.570
I think Dr. Halsey
just might understand.

24:05.653 --> 24:07.321
Oh, do you?

24:07.447 --> 24:09.866
Well, you may well be right.

24:09.949 --> 24:13.703
Are you sure you want
to find out?

24:59.123 --> 25:00.333
Herbert?

25:01.334 --> 25:02.502
Herbert.

25:02.543 --> 25:04.420
Herbert!

25:04.504 --> 25:07.006
You hear that sound?

25:07.089 --> 25:09.717
West! West!

25:11.260 --> 25:13.346
West, what is that?

25:35.159 --> 25:37.245
Quiet!

25:40.665 --> 25:42.291
Get off of...

25:42.375 --> 25:44.210
Cain!

25:47.296 --> 25:48.381
Get out of here!

25:53.553 --> 25:54.720
Get it off of me!

26:02.311 --> 26:03.604
Stay away!

26:03.688 --> 26:04.689
Later!

26:10.194 --> 26:11.779
AW, shit.

26:12.989 --> 26:14.824
There he is! Shit.

26:23.082 --> 26:24.584
Don't move.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.755
Look out!

26:29.839 --> 26:32.341
There it goes under the stairs,
it's under the stairs.

26:41.392 --> 26:43.811
Okay, I got it.

26:43.894 --> 26:45.938
I got it.

27:10.921 --> 27:14.008
Oh.

27:14.091 --> 27:15.551
Look out!

27:29.649 --> 27:30.900
It's really quite simple.

27:30.983 --> 27:33.819
All life is a physical
and chemical process, correct?

27:33.903 --> 27:37.865
It stands to reason then, that if one
could find extremely fresh specimens

27:37.948 --> 27:41.369
and recharge that chemical process,
bang, we have re-animation.

27:41.452 --> 27:46.040
- The theory is not new, West.
- But my reagent is.

27:46.123 --> 27:47.708
Read.

27:52.922 --> 27:54.590
"With various animating solutions,"

27:54.674 --> 27:56.384
"I have killed and brought
to animated life,"

27:56.467 --> 28:00.304
"a number of rabbits,
guinea pigs, cats, and dogs."

28:00.388 --> 28:02.556
I've broken the 6 to 12 minute barrier.

28:02.682 --> 28:04.517
I've conquered brain death.

28:06.936 --> 28:08.979
"With the higher animals
and the consequent"

28:09.063 --> 28:13.859
increased strength of solution,
reaction has become more violent...

28:13.943 --> 28:17.029
and my research
has become more difficult.

28:17.113 --> 28:20.449
Which is why
I need you to help me.

28:20.533 --> 28:21.534
Help you?

28:21.617 --> 28:23.869
You are the perfect person
to assist me.

28:23.953 --> 28:26.872
You're hard-working, bright,
people respect you,

28:26.956 --> 28:31.544
and you have access
to certain authorities.

28:31.627 --> 28:35.172
We can defeat death.

28:35.256 --> 28:37.842
We can achieve
every doctor's dream.

28:37.925 --> 28:41.470
You'll be famous... and live lifetimes.

28:41.554 --> 28:44.932
You haven't done this on people?

28:49.395 --> 28:51.605
I've done all I can here.

28:51.731 --> 28:54.942
I'll need new lab space.

28:55.025 --> 28:56.944
You will help me.

28:57.027 --> 28:59.655
- No!
- Why? Because it's mad?

28:59.739 --> 29:01.365
No, because I don't
believe you.

29:01.449 --> 29:03.367
How can you say that?
You've seen the results.

29:03.451 --> 29:05.661
No, Rufus wasn't dead
to begin with.

29:05.745 --> 29:07.413
You drugged him
and reduced his vital signs.

29:07.496 --> 29:08.622
You lowered his body temperature.

29:08.748 --> 29:09.832
He couldn't have been dead.

29:09.915 --> 29:11.500
Do you agree
that he's dead now?

29:12.585 --> 29:14.754
Do you agree
that he's dead now?

29:22.511 --> 29:24.513
West, no!

29:29.018 --> 29:30.227
West, stop!

29:30.311 --> 29:32.354
I'll show you.

29:32.438 --> 29:34.148
- Then you'll help me.
- No!

29:34.231 --> 29:35.357
Yes, you will.

29:35.441 --> 29:39.028
That is why I brought the infernal beast
back to life in the first place.

29:44.825 --> 29:46.660
- In the brain?
- Of course.

29:50.831 --> 29:54.710
Don't expect it to tango,
it has a broken back.

29:59.340 --> 30:03.969
God! Why does
it make that noise?

30:04.053 --> 30:06.639
Birth is always painful.

30:11.393 --> 30:12.937
It was dead.

30:13.020 --> 30:14.396
Twice.

30:18.067 --> 30:19.985
- Oh, it's him!
- Baby, what are you doing here?

30:20.069 --> 30:21.821
It's Rufus! HOW did...

30:21.862 --> 30:24.657
- Come on, let's go upstairs.
- Oh! Oh, my god.

30:32.456 --> 30:36.752
Herbert West has effected
re-animation in dead animal tissue.

30:39.255 --> 30:43.008
Mr. Cain, I'm surprised.

30:43.092 --> 30:44.093
No, I've seen it.

30:44.176 --> 30:48.097
He brought back a dead animal,
a cat, back to life.

30:48.180 --> 30:51.183
I hadn't expected such nonsense
from you, Mr. Cain,

30:51.267 --> 30:54.144
but I should have guessed it
when you took up with Mr. West.

30:54.228 --> 30:57.773
I know he's unstable,
but I've seen the results,

30:57.857 --> 31:00.025
and so has your daughter.

31:00.109 --> 31:02.194
What have you been doing
with my daughter?

31:02.278 --> 31:04.613
She walked into an experiment.

31:04.697 --> 31:07.783
You've involved Megan
in your insanity?

31:07.867 --> 31:09.785
I never intended to involve her.

31:09.869 --> 31:12.746
Tomorrow morning, you will
submit to me a written apology

31:12.872 --> 31:14.540
for this entire affair.

31:14.623 --> 31:18.002
These experiments were clearly beyond
the scope of your legitimate studies.

31:18.085 --> 31:21.422
They've obviously interfered with
your ability to do your class work.

31:21.505 --> 31:26.051
If any equipment from the hospital
or from the laboratories

31:26.135 --> 31:29.638
of Miskatonic University were involved
in any of this unauthorized activity,

31:29.722 --> 31:31.599
criminal charges
may be pressed.

31:31.682 --> 31:35.311
You will, in any case, have
your student loan rescinded.

31:37.563 --> 31:40.399
My loan?

31:40.482 --> 31:42.776
I won't be able to continue school.

31:42.902 --> 31:45.321
As for Mr. West,
he needs submit no apology.

31:45.404 --> 31:48.782
You may tell him that he may
continue with his research

31:48.908 --> 31:51.076
without the impediment
of an education.

31:51.160 --> 31:53.954
As of now, he is no longer
a student of this university.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.082
Sir, can we please just discuss this?

31:57.166 --> 31:59.418
I think you're being blinded
by your emotions.

32:00.461 --> 32:03.047
That will be all, Mr. Cain.

32:11.639 --> 32:13.557
Don't take this out on Meg.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.101
She tried to stop me.

32:16.185 --> 32:19.188
I said that will be all.

32:34.954 --> 32:37.373
- Oh, they keep on a comin', don't they?
- Oh, yeah.

32:46.840 --> 32:49.677
You ain't got my lunch
under there, have you?

32:49.760 --> 32:52.012
Yeah, one meatball
run over by a semi.

32:52.096 --> 32:53.472
Ew!

32:53.555 --> 32:55.849
I lost my appetite. You gonna
be around for a while?

32:55.975 --> 32:58.477
I might go catch me
some coffee.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.062
- Take your time.
- You got it.

33:09.279 --> 33:11.031
Meatball?

33:11.115 --> 33:12.992
Just put your shoes on.

33:25.921 --> 33:27.339
Oh, damn, if we get caught...

33:27.423 --> 33:29.341
Oh, well, what will they do?

33:29.425 --> 33:31.176
Embalm us?

33:31.260 --> 33:33.762
Let's go.

33:51.947 --> 33:54.575
Burn victim.

33:59.163 --> 34:01.165
- Here's your meatball.
- Oh.

34:05.919 --> 34:08.047
Shotgun wound to the head.

34:10.215 --> 34:12.217
Oh, god, he's rotten.

34:14.887 --> 34:17.056
- Malpractice.
- Shit.

34:18.264 --> 34:20.059
Let's go, we're not going
to find anything.

34:20.141 --> 34:21.851
Wait. Wait!

34:26.690 --> 34:29.525
Yes, I think you.

34:29.610 --> 34:31.360
How long?

34:31.445 --> 34:33.781
He arrived early this evening.

34:33.864 --> 34:36.199
John Doe, apparently just dropped dead.

34:36.283 --> 34:39.078
No record of any damage.
It's almost perfect.

34:40.329 --> 34:41.789
Why "almost"?

34:41.871 --> 34:43.873
Could be heart damage.

34:43.956 --> 34:44.958
Then let's just find another one.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.085
No! We do not have time!

34:47.168 --> 34:49.004
All we need tonight

34:49.088 --> 34:51.507
is a specific, conscious reaction.

34:51.590 --> 34:53.175
He's been dead for hours.

34:53.257 --> 34:56.553
Any evidence of re-animated
consciousness will justify proceeding.

34:59.181 --> 35:01.183
Start the recorder.

35:02.267 --> 35:04.269
Start the damn recorder!

35:07.523 --> 35:09.525
Make the entry.

35:11.360 --> 35:13.278
October...

35:13.362 --> 35:15.405
Tenth.

35:15.489 --> 35:17.950
- Subject: Male.
- Age?

35:19.034 --> 35:22.204
Age, early twenties.

35:22.287 --> 35:25.290
- Physical condition?
- No deformities.

35:25.374 --> 35:29.002
Appears to have been in
excellent physical condition.

35:31.338 --> 35:34.133
Apparent cause of death...

35:36.844 --> 35:38.846
what?

35:38.929 --> 35:43.517
Heart failure.

35:45.727 --> 35:48.939
Time, 10:33 PM.

35:49.022 --> 35:51.859
10:33 PM.

35:54.486 --> 35:56.488
15 cc's.

35:58.532 --> 36:00.993
15 cc's of reagent being administered.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.295
He loves me,
we're getting married.

36:11.378 --> 36:14.256
He's mad! I've seen this happen
to medical students before.

36:14.339 --> 36:15.757
Good ones!

36:15.841 --> 36:19.094
Dr. Harrod, is Mr. Cain loose
in this hospital?

36:19.178 --> 36:21.096
In the morgue, I think, doctor.

36:21.180 --> 36:24.099
I specifically told
Dr. Riley to suspend him,

36:24.183 --> 36:27.102
and to take him off the floor
if he reported to work!

36:27.186 --> 36:30.606
Dr. Riley's been
in emergency surgery for four hours.

36:30.689 --> 36:33.984
I haven't seen him.

36:34.067 --> 36:35.360
Time elapsed.

36:39.198 --> 36:41.074
15 seconds.

36:43.368 --> 36:46.121
Something should
have happened by now.

36:57.216 --> 37:00.302
It's not working.

37:00.385 --> 37:01.386
Let's get out of here!

37:01.470 --> 37:04.640
Obviously, the human dosage
factor is unknown.

37:04.723 --> 37:07.351
Increasing the dosage,
20 cc's of reagent.

37:07.434 --> 37:09.269
- Herbert, let's go!
- No!

37:35.170 --> 37:36.421
Damn!

37:36.505 --> 37:39.508
Page Mr. Cain and have him report
to Level L security desk,

37:39.591 --> 37:42.719
and make sure
that she stays right here.

37:42.803 --> 37:45.264
You can't stop me! I followed you here,
and I'm gonna follow you

37:45.305 --> 37:46.431
- until you listen to me!
- Megan!

37:46.515 --> 37:47.516
- I love him!
- You're my daughter,

37:47.599 --> 37:49.434
and you'll do as you're told!

37:49.518 --> 37:51.436
Sit down, Miss Halsey.

37:51.520 --> 37:53.981
Mr. Cain will be up soon,
you can discuss it then.

37:54.064 --> 37:55.899
Don't blame him, Daddy!

37:55.983 --> 37:58.986
We failed.

37:59.069 --> 38:00.279
Come on, let's go!

38:00.320 --> 38:01.863
I mean, someone
could be coming any minute!

38:01.947 --> 38:05.367
He failed! Not I!

38:05.450 --> 38:07.661
<i>Mr. Cain, Mr. Daniel Cain,</i>

38:07.744 --> 38:10.831
<i>please report
to the security desk, Level L</i>

38:11.832 --> 38:13.125
Oh, god.

38:13.208 --> 38:14.876
Cover him up.

38:16.003 --> 38:18.422
- Let's go!
- All right!

38:37.149 --> 38:39.568
Grab him!

38:43.113 --> 38:44.781
Stop!

38:48.702 --> 38:50.078
It listened to me.

38:58.962 --> 39:00.547
Cain?

39:02.591 --> 39:04.384
Cain?

39:06.636 --> 39:08.555
Cain, open up this door.

39:09.556 --> 39:12.642
Help!

39:12.726 --> 39:14.061
Get help!

39:14.144 --> 39:16.980
Is West in there with you?

39:17.064 --> 39:18.231
You're in a lot of trouble,
both of you!

39:41.671 --> 39:43.465
No!

39:50.639 --> 39:52.641
Let go!

40:05.654 --> 40:07.406
Stop!

40:07.489 --> 40:08.657
For god's sakes!

40:09.658 --> 40:12.744
Dan... look out.

40:42.691 --> 40:45.610
Come on.

40:45.694 --> 40:47.696
Find the recorder.

40:49.281 --> 40:52.242
- Herbert... no.
- Did you see him react?

40:52.325 --> 40:54.911
He listened to me.
It made a conscious act.

40:54.995 --> 40:57.914
He heard you as an animal would.

40:58.915 --> 41:01.001
Herbert, no, you can't be serious!

41:01.084 --> 41:02.544
Hell, you may be right.

41:02.627 --> 41:03.753
It'd probably been dead too long.

41:03.837 --> 41:06.465
It wasn't fresh enough!

41:06.506 --> 41:09.468
We probably only revived the senses
and the instincts, so, come on!

41:09.509 --> 41:11.636
Help me get him up.

41:11.720 --> 41:12.804
Is he dead?

41:12.888 --> 41:15.223
Of course, will you
give me a hand here?

41:15.307 --> 41:17.767
Now, he interrupted an important
experiment in progress.

41:17.851 --> 41:19.186
Granted, it was an accident.

41:19.269 --> 41:21.646
But this is the freshest body
that we could come across

41:21.730 --> 41:22.898
save of killing one ourselves,

41:22.981 --> 41:25.317
and every moment that we spend
talking about it costs us results!

41:25.400 --> 41:27.402
Now will you give me a hand?

41:29.362 --> 41:33.074
Dan, we can bring him back to life.

41:46.713 --> 41:48.298
Okay.

41:56.139 --> 41:58.266
Now, get the recorder.

41:59.726 --> 42:01.228
Find my serum.

42:04.940 --> 42:06.816
This is a dream.

42:06.900 --> 42:08.985
Fiction.

42:09.986 --> 42:11.780
Here. Do his other hand.

42:13.907 --> 42:16.451
Oh, good.

42:16.535 --> 42:22.332
Unbreakable plastic, one of
man's few durable inventions.

42:24.417 --> 42:26.419
Certainly more durable than this.

42:27.546 --> 42:31.341
We need you in the crash room.

42:31.424 --> 42:33.301
Coming.

43:02.122 --> 43:04.165
12 cc's being administered.

43:04.249 --> 43:08.837
The dosage lessened in accordance
to the freshness of the subject.

43:22.851 --> 43:28.315
5 seconds.

43:28.398 --> 43:30.650
Come on.

43:30.734 --> 43:34.446
I'll show you.

43:34.529 --> 43:38.617
15 seconds. I'll show you!

43:38.658 --> 43:40.160
17 seconds.

43:40.243 --> 43:42.662
Re-animation at 17 seconds!
The eyes opened!

43:42.746 --> 43:44.956
Doctor. Dr. Halsey,

43:45.040 --> 43:48.627
you once did me a favor by
letting me into your medical school.

43:48.668 --> 43:49.794
Doctor?

43:49.878 --> 43:51.630
Welcome back to life.

44:14.944 --> 44:16.821
Daddy?

44:16.905 --> 44:18.531
Dan?

44:18.657 --> 44:20.075
Damn the bitch.

44:20.158 --> 44:23.828
Megan... Meg?

44:25.705 --> 44:30.377
Dan, what is it,
are you all right?

44:34.297 --> 44:38.927
Dan, he's trying to speak,
the recorder!

44:41.596 --> 44:43.056
No!

44:43.139 --> 44:44.933
Daddy!

44:45.016 --> 44:46.101
Daddy, no!

44:46.184 --> 44:47.894
No! No, Meg, don't go near him!

44:47.977 --> 44:48.895
What the hell happened here?

44:48.978 --> 44:50.855
Dan, you all right?

44:50.939 --> 44:52.732
Who's that?

44:54.693 --> 44:58.571
That is Dean Halsey, sir.

44:58.697 --> 45:01.700
You see I came down here
to visit Mr. Cain,

45:01.741 --> 45:04.703
who was here working
and Halsey entered

45:04.786 --> 45:07.706
and started ranting at us,
rather irrationally.

45:07.789 --> 45:09.207
No!

45:09.290 --> 45:11.751
He was just angry!

45:11.835 --> 45:12.794
Daddy!

45:12.877 --> 45:13.837
Meg. What happened?

45:13.920 --> 45:15.004
Who's that over there?

45:15.088 --> 45:16.881
Just a corpse.

45:16.965 --> 45:20.385
You see, Halsey came in,
grabbed that thing,

45:20.468 --> 45:23.763
and, well, went crazy.

45:23.847 --> 45:25.265
Dean Halsey?

45:25.348 --> 45:26.307
Dean Halsey!

45:26.391 --> 45:27.308
Arrest them!

45:27.392 --> 45:29.185
I'm calling the police!

45:29.269 --> 45:30.979
Oh, Daddy!

45:42.991 --> 45:47.579
Shock... don't worry.

46:13.229 --> 46:16.691
Daddy.

46:16.775 --> 46:19.235
He can't hear you, or see you.

46:19.319 --> 46:23.948
That's a one-way mirror.

46:24.032 --> 46:28.036
What is wrong with him, Doctor?

46:28.119 --> 46:29.204
Will he ever be...

46:29.287 --> 46:31.956
Until we know exactly what
happened to him,

46:32.040 --> 46:37.796
there's no way to determine
his course of recovery.

46:37.837 --> 46:40.590
That's why I need you
to sign a release,

46:40.673 --> 46:44.803
so that I can perform
exploratory surgery on him.

46:44.844 --> 46:47.806
Is that absolutely necessary,
Dr. Hill?

46:47.847 --> 46:52.519
I know how difficult
this must be for you,

46:52.602 --> 46:57.816
but I'm convinced that your father's
problem is neurological.

46:57.857 --> 47:01.069
Of course, we'll take
every precaution.

47:04.614 --> 47:07.992
You must trust me.

47:19.337 --> 47:23.049
I want to take a look at the
right frontal lobe.

47:23.132 --> 47:25.009
I'll open the skull here...

47:25.093 --> 47:28.012
I don't want to know.

47:28.096 --> 47:31.349
Just help him.

47:52.245 --> 47:55.039
Please, doctor.

47:55.123 --> 47:58.126
Please let me talk to him.

47:58.209 --> 48:00.795
No.

48:00.879 --> 48:05.091
I must insist you leave his
treatment up to me.

48:05.174 --> 48:10.346
I want you to think of me as someone
you can come to with your problems.

48:13.558 --> 48:16.895
Or if you're ever lonely.

48:20.523 --> 48:24.402
I know you're all by yourself now.

48:33.244 --> 48:35.622
I'm going to take care
of him, doctor,

48:35.705 --> 48:39.167
and I'm going to find out
what happened to him.

49:20.333 --> 49:22.710
What are you doing here?

49:22.794 --> 49:25.296
I've been waiting for you.

49:25.380 --> 49:29.467
I have to tell you.

49:29.550 --> 49:33.888
What did you do to him?

49:33.972 --> 49:38.518
What did you and West do
to him to make him like that?

49:38.601 --> 49:42.981
It was... it was horrible.

49:43.022 --> 49:46.567
I didn't...

49:46.651 --> 49:49.028
What did you do to him?

49:56.119 --> 49:57.662
He's not insane.

50:02.166 --> 50:05.169
He's dead.

50:05.253 --> 50:09.549
No. No.

50:09.632 --> 50:13.136
You're insane,
you are insane, no!

50:13.219 --> 50:15.179
You know it's true, Meg.

50:15.263 --> 50:16.806
You know it's true.

50:16.889 --> 50:20.018
No.

50:23.438 --> 50:29.027
Daddy. Daddy.

50:32.572 --> 50:36.034
I'll tell you, Meg, everything.

50:48.337 --> 50:50.798
Good evening, Mr. West.

50:55.553 --> 50:57.805
What do you want?

50:57.889 --> 51:00.892
I want to know why Halsey's
heart fibrillated.

51:00.975 --> 51:02.310
I don't have to talk to you.

51:02.393 --> 51:04.062
Why his pulse is erratic.

51:04.145 --> 51:06.230
I've told everything I know
to the police.

51:06.314 --> 51:08.566
Why he cries out in pain.

51:08.649 --> 51:10.068
You can leave now, doctor.

51:10.109 --> 51:14.864
When we both know
he is quite dead.

51:21.329 --> 51:25.083
Interesting little laboratory
you have here.

51:25.124 --> 51:30.463
Mr. West, I recognize this?

51:32.715 --> 51:34.634
What do you want?

51:34.717 --> 51:38.846
Yes, we are both scientists.

51:38.930 --> 51:41.891
Let us get to the point.

51:45.353 --> 51:49.107
I want your discovery.

51:49.190 --> 51:52.985
Whatever it is that gives the
dead the appearance of life.

51:53.111 --> 51:55.279
Oh, it is not the appearance
of life, it is life.

51:55.363 --> 51:59.617
This is not magic, as you say,
I am a scientist.

51:59.700 --> 52:03.204
I'll have you locked up
for a madman...

52:03.287 --> 52:05.373
or a murderer.

52:11.379 --> 52:14.632
You will do...

52:14.715 --> 52:17.385
what I tell you to do.

52:50.626 --> 52:53.921
Ingenious, Mr. West.

52:54.005 --> 52:59.260
Your extension of that old fool
Gruber's work is really quite...

52:59.343 --> 53:00.386
brilliant.

53:21.199 --> 53:22.992
Has Dr. Hill examined
your father?

53:23.075 --> 53:24.368
Yes.

53:24.452 --> 53:28.080
He wanted to do exploratory
surgery on him.

53:28.206 --> 53:30.416
Oh, shit.

53:30.499 --> 53:33.628
Then he'll find out.

53:33.711 --> 53:36.881
Eventually he'll find out.

53:36.964 --> 53:39.926
Let us see...

53:40.009 --> 53:43.387
my new serum at work?

53:46.349 --> 53:48.267
Dead cat tissue.

53:53.231 --> 53:57.276
Reagent.

54:20.299 --> 54:22.510
Magnificent.

54:40.486 --> 54:43.906
Yes, Mr. West.

54:43.990 --> 54:48.452
I will be famous.

54:59.422 --> 55:01.924
Laid to rest.

55:47.762 --> 55:50.598
Yes.

55:54.268 --> 55:57.104
Parts.

55:57.188 --> 56:02.360
I've never done whole parts.

56:51.909 --> 56:56.664
Wesssssst

56:59.834 --> 57:01.919
Yes, doctor.

57:02.002 --> 57:04.588
It's Herbert West.

57:04.672 --> 57:05.840
What are you thinking?

57:05.923 --> 57:09.844
How do you feel?

57:09.927 --> 57:13.431
Yooooooou.

57:13.472 --> 57:14.598
" You."

57:14.682 --> 57:20.438
Baaassstaaard

58:57.201 --> 58:58.285
Dan!

58:58.369 --> 59:01.580
Oh my god, what has Hill
done to him?

59:06.794 --> 59:11.090
Looks like a laser drill.

59:11.173 --> 59:12.800
Your father's been lobotomized.

59:58.345 --> 01:00:01.599
That's it.

01:00:01.682 --> 01:00:04.852
My work! My work!

01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:05.894
What's going on?

01:00:05.978 --> 01:00:08.731
My work is gone.

01:00:08.814 --> 01:00:10.774
It's all gone.

01:00:10.858 --> 01:00:12.359
He took my serum!

01:00:12.443 --> 01:00:13.777
Except for what
I have upstairs.

01:00:13.861 --> 01:00:15.279
Who?

01:00:15.362 --> 01:00:16.697
What happened here?

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:18.157
Hill.

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:21.201
Hill took my serum!
My notes! Everything.

01:00:21.285 --> 01:00:22.286
Herbert, you're insane!

01:00:22.369 --> 01:00:24.538
- Now, what happened here?
- I had to kill him.

01:00:24.622 --> 01:00:26.790
What?

01:00:26.874 --> 01:00:30.628
He's dead?

01:00:30.711 --> 01:00:34.923
- Not any more.
- No, Herbert.

01:00:35.007 --> 01:00:36.175
This has gotta stop!

01:00:36.258 --> 01:00:37.801
Look, he tried
to blackmail me, Dan.

01:00:37.885 --> 01:00:38.802
Enough is enough!

01:00:38.886 --> 01:00:40.512
And he wanted you to disappear!

01:00:50.898 --> 01:00:54.652
Oh. Oh.

01:00:54.735 --> 01:00:56.362
Oh, that's why he did
it to Halsey.

01:00:56.445 --> 01:00:57.696
What? You've seen Halsey?

01:00:57.780 --> 01:01:00.949
He lobotomized him, so he could
control him in case

01:01:01.033 --> 01:01:03.285
he ever tried to talk or tell
somebody what happened.

01:01:03.369 --> 01:01:05.663
<i>So he could protect his discovery.</i>

01:01:05.704 --> 01:01:07.414
- Yes.
- Very clever.

01:01:07.498 --> 01:01:09.041
I gotta tell Meg.

01:01:09.124 --> 01:01:11.001
What does Meg
have to do with this?

01:01:11.085 --> 01:01:12.419
Hill's got this weird file on her,

01:01:12.503 --> 01:01:15.005
it's full of napkins and hair
and photographs.

01:01:15.089 --> 01:01:17.549
I think he's projected some sort
of psychotic need onto her.

01:02:55.773 --> 01:02:58.776
Yes.

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:15.959
Alan.

01:03:22.257 --> 01:03:25.844
Alan.

01:03:55.916 --> 01:03:59.962
Oh... yes...

01:04:01.421 --> 01:04:03.549
Alan.

01:04:05.843 --> 01:04:10.848
It's... time for you...

01:04:10.931 --> 01:04:14.643
to come out now.

01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:49.177
Is that you, Dr. Hill?

01:04:49.261 --> 01:04:50.554
Of course it's me.

01:05:03.108 --> 01:05:05.193
Break time.

01:05:34.056 --> 01:05:37.935
That's... better.

01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:27.985
Meg? Meg!

01:06:28.068 --> 01:06:31.446
Dan? Dan...

01:06:31.530 --> 01:06:35.033
- I was so afraid.
- What is it?

01:06:35.117 --> 01:06:37.119
What's the matter?

01:06:37.202 --> 01:06:41.373
Well... I don't know.

01:06:41.456 --> 01:06:43.500
I was just worried about you.

01:06:45.002 --> 01:06:47.254
Why?

01:06:47.337 --> 01:06:52.050
L... I just feel horrible
about everything.

01:06:55.095 --> 01:06:57.264
I guess I'm just getting paranoid.

01:07:00.934 --> 01:07:03.353
It's just...

01:07:03.437 --> 01:07:05.022
so hard to lose you.

01:07:07.691 --> 01:07:10.110
You should go away.

01:07:12.487 --> 01:07:15.365
Transfer to another school.

01:07:15.449 --> 01:07:17.451
Don't worry about me.

01:07:20.203 --> 01:07:22.414
You're the one
that should get away.

01:07:25.333 --> 01:07:26.376
Go live your life.

01:07:30.464 --> 01:07:33.216
Find somebody.

01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:35.343
I tried to hate you.

01:07:38.764 --> 01:07:41.600
I wanted so much to hate you.

01:07:46.938 --> 01:07:49.107
I love you.

01:07:51.318 --> 01:07:52.903
No! Daddy!

01:07:52.986 --> 01:07:57.324
Dr. Halsey.

01:07:57.407 --> 01:07:59.242
No, Daddy!

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:05.457
Oh, no, Daddy!

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:07.834
Daddy! Daddy!

01:08:21.932 --> 01:08:23.850
The door.

01:09:05.392 --> 01:09:08.019
Oh... yes.

01:09:54.191 --> 01:09:59.196
Dan? Dan?

01:09:59.279 --> 01:10:01.364
Dan?

01:10:01.448 --> 01:10:04.201
Come on.

01:10:06.661 --> 01:10:08.747
Oh, well, you'll be all right.

01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:11.208
Meg!

01:10:11.291 --> 01:10:12.500
Oh my god.

01:10:12.584 --> 01:10:14.002
Where, Herbert?

01:10:14.085 --> 01:10:16.880
He's at the hospital I imagine.
Can you stand up?

01:10:16.963 --> 01:10:18.215
Let's go.

01:10:24.137 --> 01:10:26.137
Oh... Meg.

01:11:08.265 --> 01:11:10.976
I've... always...

01:11:11.977 --> 01:11:15.563
admired your beauty, my dear.

01:11:18.191 --> 01:11:22.320
I think I've always loved you.

01:11:30.370 --> 01:11:33.415
You will love me.

01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:42.215
You will.

01:11:44.759 --> 01:11:46.511
Please!

01:11:46.594 --> 01:11:48.596
Please stop!

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:50.307
Let me go!

01:11:50.348 --> 01:11:53.810
That's it, my dearest Meg...

01:11:53.893 --> 01:11:56.563
more passion!

01:11:59.691 --> 01:12:04.321
- Oh my god!
- Yes, my love!

01:12:05.572 --> 01:12:07.324
I must say, Dr. Hill...

01:12:07.407 --> 01:12:11.077
I'm very disappointed in you.

01:12:11.161 --> 01:12:13.663
You steal the secret
of life and death,

01:12:13.747 --> 01:12:17.000
and here you are trysting
with the bubble-headed coed,

01:12:17.083 --> 01:12:19.878
you're not even
a second-rate scientist.

01:12:19.961 --> 01:12:23.214
Mr. West.

01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:26.468
I'm actually glad to see you.

01:12:27.969 --> 01:12:32.974
It saves me the trouble
of having to send for you.

01:12:33.058 --> 01:12:35.352
You'll never get credit
for my discovery.

01:12:35.435 --> 01:12:37.062
Who's gonna believe
a talking head?

01:12:37.145 --> 01:12:38.938
Get a job in a sideshow.

01:12:39.022 --> 01:12:41.358
I wonder why

01:12:41.441 --> 01:12:45.820
an intelligent young man like yourself

01:12:47.572 --> 01:12:52.285
should make such a foolish,
fatal mistake,

01:12:52.369 --> 01:12:56.247
of coming here to challenge me.

01:12:57.248 --> 01:13:00.418
Oh... I have a plan.

01:13:00.502 --> 01:13:04.672
So do I.

01:13:21.731 --> 01:13:23.650
Let go of me!

01:13:43.753 --> 01:13:44.921
Enough!

01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:02.772
I will show you power, Mr. West!

01:14:02.856 --> 01:14:04.983
My discovery,

01:14:05.066 --> 01:14:07.902
a laser surgical drill.

01:14:07.986 --> 01:14:12.073
It makes possible a new
technique in lobotomy,

01:14:13.074 --> 01:14:17.120
which results in total mastery

01:14:17.203 --> 01:14:19.289
of the human will.

01:14:19.372 --> 01:14:22.375
Re-animated subjects

01:14:22.459 --> 01:14:25.587
have proven to be the best.

01:14:25.670 --> 01:14:29.466
They will give me power!

01:14:29.549 --> 01:14:32.802
Undreamed of power.

01:14:35.305 --> 01:14:37.182
Stay behind me.

01:14:41.728 --> 01:14:42.896
Daddy, listen to me.

01:14:42.979 --> 01:14:45.231
It's Megan, Megan!

01:14:45.315 --> 01:14:49.235
- Hill, they'll kill her!
- Then I'll give her life!

01:14:51.237 --> 01:14:53.615
Look at me!

01:15:56.803 --> 01:15:57.887
Meg, come on!

01:15:57.971 --> 01:15:59.722
Let's go! Come on!

01:15:59.806 --> 01:16:00.723
Wait!

01:16:00.807 --> 01:16:02.475
I am not through here!

01:16:02.559 --> 01:16:04.894
Megan, no!

01:16:04.978 --> 01:16:08.439
- Let me go!
- I told you, I have a theory!

01:16:08.565 --> 01:16:10.775
- Overdose!
- No!

01:17:03.286 --> 01:17:06.706
Herbert!

01:17:24.974 --> 01:17:27.894
Look out!

01:17:34.692 --> 01:17:37.445
Daddy!

01:17:46.913 --> 01:17:47.914
My notes.

01:17:49.916 --> 01:17:51.918
MY notes!

01:17:55.254 --> 01:17:57.298
Let's go.

01:18:25.702 --> 01:18:27.704
Come on!

01:19:38.024 --> 01:19:39.150
My god! Megan!

01:19:39.233 --> 01:19:40.193
Take her into number three!

01:19:40.276 --> 01:19:42.653
Bring her this way!

01:19:46.491 --> 01:19:49.952
Hurry, hurry,
she's got nothing.

01:19:50.036 --> 01:19:52.622
Activating.

01:19:52.705 --> 01:19:53.831
Air on.

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:02.590
Somebody give me some paste!

01:20:02.673 --> 01:20:03.883
On three.

01:20:06.385 --> 01:20:07.386
Okay, everybody off.

01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:10.348
Clear.

01:20:13.726 --> 01:20:15.394
Nothing.

01:20:16.395 --> 01:20:17.980
Bringing back air.

01:20:20.942 --> 01:20:22.819
The trachea's fractured.

01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:24.195
She's fixed and dilated.

01:20:24.278 --> 01:20:26.739
No response.

01:20:31.202 --> 01:20:35.081
Cain... Cain.

01:22:14.263 --> 01:22:15.932
I love you.
