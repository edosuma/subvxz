WEBVTT

00:03.080 --> 00:05.992
Where the hell is Carla?
We're gonna miss the previews.

00:06.080 --> 00:08.878
- Hey, you're black, right?
- Here we go.

00:08.960 --> 00:12.316
I hate that stereotype that
black people yell at movie screens.

00:12.400 --> 00:15.233
Like you see some horror flick
and you'd be yelling,

00:15.320 --> 00:18.312
"Don't go in there, girl!
He behind the door!" You know?

00:18.400 --> 00:20.709
It's like... It's offensive.

00:20.800 --> 00:23.872
You wish you were allowed
to yell at the screen, don't ya?

00:23.960 --> 00:26.918
Why does she go in there?
I mean, he's behind the door!

00:27.000 --> 00:29.719
It's weird to run into
someone from the hospital

00:29.800 --> 00:31.279
out in the real world.

00:31.360 --> 00:33.635
- Hey, Dr Kelso.
- How ya doing, sir?

00:33.720 --> 00:35.551
I'm just Jim Dandy.

00:35.640 --> 00:38.234
Now, unless your pants
are made out of Turtle Wax,

00:38.320 --> 00:40.959
I suggest you boys
get your asses off of Bessie.

00:41.040 --> 00:43.031
Oh, so you named your car, huh?

00:47.280 --> 00:49.475
Ultimately,
life is a lot simpler at home.

00:49.560 --> 00:51.915
Unless you live with
a co-worker you like

00:52.000 --> 00:54.594
who decided she can't handle
sleeping with you

00:54.680 --> 00:56.432
and she just
wants to be friends.

00:56.520 --> 00:58.511
Oh, right.

00:58.600 --> 01:01.353
- Morning, buddy.
- Morning, pal.

01:01.440 --> 01:06.514
I'll just go get dressed
and then we can go to work.

01:06.600 --> 01:10.388
All right, just relax.
You can totally handle this.

01:12.480 --> 01:14.550
Chop-chop, buddy.

01:16.640 --> 01:18.471
Told you
I could fit in this spot.

01:18.560 --> 01:23.429
You were right. I'll just put this guy's
side-view mirror on his roof.

01:24.440 --> 01:26.829
Hey, JD.

01:26.920 --> 01:27.909
Yes?

01:28.000 --> 01:30.958
I wanted to say something
before we go back in here.

01:31.040 --> 01:33.508
- Go ahead.
- I understand it's harder

01:33.600 --> 01:36.672
for you to transition
into being just friends again.

01:36.760 --> 01:37.909
Why?

01:39.040 --> 01:40.519
Because you're a guy.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.909
What does that
have to do with anything?

01:43.000 --> 01:44.991
You're right.
Know what we should do?

01:45.080 --> 01:47.833
Everything I own
is in this truck, including my bed.

01:47.920 --> 01:49.956
We should just get in there,
get naked,

01:50.040 --> 01:53.635
and have sex one last time,
just get it out of our system.

01:55.480 --> 01:58.278
JD, I was kidding
to prove a point.

01:58.360 --> 02:00.271
I know.

02:01.680 --> 02:05.389
Oh, yeah.
This is how you like it.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:25.800 --> 02:27.836
See? This is good.
I don't feel weird.

02:27.920 --> 02:30.912
- I don't feel weird.
- I feel weird.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.753
OK, just tell her the truth.
You're crazy about her.

02:33.840 --> 02:36.308
- Look, Elliot, l...
- Oh, damn.

02:36.400 --> 02:38.595
I missed the annual sleepover,
didn't l?

02:38.680 --> 02:40.272
That wonderful time of year

02:40.360 --> 02:42.920
when you two crazy kids
throw caution to the wind

02:43.000 --> 02:45.275
and make sweet,
elbowy love to each other.

02:45.360 --> 02:50.036
Don't you be shy. You can tell
Uncle Coxy about the naught-ay.

02:50.120 --> 02:53.715
Dr Cox, I lost my apartment and
so I was just needing a place to stay.

02:53.800 --> 02:55.836
So you went over
to your friend's house

02:55.920 --> 02:57.911
and cried on his shoulder,
boo-hoo.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.912
You comforted her because
she was weak and vulnerable

03:01.000 --> 03:03.878
and blah, blah, blah, nerdy sex.

03:03.960 --> 03:06.349
The end. Dear Lord,
Laverne, how in God's name

03:06.440 --> 03:08.476
do you listen
to this crap all day long?

03:08.560 --> 03:11.154
Are you kidding? If he turns out
to be her brother,

03:11.240 --> 03:12.878
this is better than my stories.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.552
Oh, you are so right.

03:14.640 --> 03:16.676
Dude, what were her boobs like?

03:16.760 --> 03:19.035
Todd, I'm standing right here.

03:19.120 --> 03:21.554
I'm sorry.
What are your boobs like?

03:24.440 --> 03:27.830
Oh, joy of joys, Mr Corman,
you've joined us yet again.

03:27.920 --> 03:31.435
What imaginary disease is ailing
you this time, my good man?

03:31.520 --> 03:33.397
He thinks he has the Yaba virus.

03:33.480 --> 03:36.392
Your hair got longer.
And I don't appreciate your tone.

03:36.480 --> 03:39.916
Last month you thought you had
Familial Mediterranean Fever.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.514
I was at my friend Kelly
Papadopolous' wedding.

03:42.600 --> 03:45.114
I share a glass of ouzo
with this guy named Yanos.

03:45.200 --> 03:46.758
20 minutes later I'm in a cab,

03:46.840 --> 03:49.513
I ask the guy to pull over
because I'm gonna explode

03:49.600 --> 03:52.353
in some guy's rose garden.
Now what would you think?

03:52.440 --> 03:54.237
Same thing I think right now.

03:54.320 --> 03:57.312
You got yourself a bad case
of the "Wish you were sicks."

03:57.400 --> 04:01.313
Well, I read the symptoms
on the lnternet, OK? I have Yaba.

04:01.400 --> 04:04.995
Have you been in contact
with many exotic primates this year?

04:05.080 --> 04:06.911
I have been to the zoo, yes.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.310
And while you were there,
did you jump into the cage

04:10.400 --> 04:13.392
and play "toss the poop"
with the other monkeys?

04:13.480 --> 04:16.074
Because if you did,
then you just might have Yaba.

04:16.160 --> 04:19.072
But if that's the case,
it would be way, way down

04:19.160 --> 04:21.071
on the list of your problems.

04:21.160 --> 04:25.153
- Give him a full work-up.
- OK, you know the drill.

04:25.240 --> 04:28.198
Here are my vitals.
Here is the Mountain Dew.

04:28.280 --> 04:30.475
Just kidding.
That's my urine sample.

04:30.560 --> 04:32.755
And you can start timing... now.

04:32.840 --> 04:36.196
So, how you been doing?
Still seeing that surgeon?

04:36.280 --> 04:37.508
No talking.

04:40.520 --> 04:42.033
OK, vision perfect.

04:42.120 --> 04:46.193
Hey, are you trying to make time
with my best girl, sport?

04:46.280 --> 04:51.434
Now, how do you feel
after surgery on your...?

04:51.520 --> 04:53.715
- Brain.
- Brain. Mrs Kaye is doing great,

04:53.800 --> 04:56.758
but after this type of procedure
most people experience

04:56.840 --> 04:59.957
- a diminished reaction time.
- Christopher, come here.

05:01.320 --> 05:05.313
Maybe you should worry
about your own reaction time.

05:05.400 --> 05:08.551
Now, do you have
a ride home today, dear?

05:08.640 --> 05:10.312
- I drove myself.
- Well,

05:10.400 --> 05:13.915
it always warmed my heart
to see your face.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.036
I don't care what the old bat says,

05:16.120 --> 05:18.509
I doubt she can back
out of her own driveway.

05:18.600 --> 05:22.673
Tell her you're calling the DMV
and having her license revoked.

05:22.760 --> 05:24.910
Why don't you
tell her yourself, sir?

05:25.000 --> 05:26.956
Cos she's my friend.

05:27.040 --> 05:29.713
Don't be insensitive, son.
It's ugly on you.

05:30.960 --> 05:34.032
I can't take the sweet
old lady's driver's license.

05:34.120 --> 05:35.951
She reminds me of my gram-gram.

05:36.040 --> 05:38.600
- Get someone else to do it.
- Like who?

05:41.320 --> 05:43.231
Give me it!

05:47.600 --> 05:49.989
You want this?
You want this? Psych!

05:59.800 --> 06:01.472
- Never mind.
- Hi, JD.

06:01.560 --> 06:03.357
- Hey, Lisa.
- Dude.

06:03.440 --> 06:06.512
This gift-shop chick, did you ever...?

06:06.600 --> 06:09.114
Turk! Elliot's right here.

06:09.200 --> 06:12.397
- Why would I care?
- I'm sorry.

06:12.480 --> 06:15.472
I guess when I was passing by
JD's room the other night,

06:15.560 --> 06:18.472
he was telling a different
Dr Reid not to stop.

06:18.560 --> 06:23.429
- "Dr Reid"? Sweet.
- You guys, this conversation

06:23.520 --> 06:26.239
is starting to make me feel
a little uncomfortable.

06:26.320 --> 06:29.153
And I'm sure Dr Reid
feels the same way.

06:29.240 --> 06:32.994
No, I don't. You can...
with anyone that you want.

06:33.080 --> 06:37.073
So she wants to play chicken, huh?
Well, buckle up, missy.

06:37.160 --> 06:39.515
- Maybe I'll ask Lisa out again.
- You should.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.113
- Maybe I will.
- Cool.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.919
- Good. That's what I'll do.
- Let me know how it goes.

06:46.400 --> 06:50.234
I'm taking my own car in case
you turn into a freak again.

06:50.320 --> 06:52.231
It's a date!

06:53.080 --> 06:56.152
The guy is here like a thousand
times a year taking up a bed,

06:56.240 --> 06:58.470
and every second with him
is time away

06:58.560 --> 07:00.437
from somebody I could help.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.476
What do you want me
to do about it?

07:02.560 --> 07:03.754
Follow my lead.

07:04.960 --> 07:08.111
Alas, Mr Corman, shockingly,
all your labs have come back

07:08.200 --> 07:11.033
and they're negative
for everything.

07:11.120 --> 07:14.476
- Oh, come on.
- OK, I'll tell you what.

07:14.560 --> 07:17.757
You have suggested that
you're feeling rather tired lately,

07:17.840 --> 07:20.195
- haven't you?
- I'm listening.

07:20.280 --> 07:23.352
- And that you bruise easily.
- Like an old banana.

07:23.440 --> 07:25.476
I think you're fine,
but if you'd like,

07:25.560 --> 07:27.949
we can go ahead and check out
your bone marrow.

07:28.040 --> 07:30.395
That would mean
sticking an enormous needle

07:30.480 --> 07:32.152
all the way through your hip,

07:32.240 --> 07:35.038
and it's very, very, very
excruciatingly painful.

07:35.120 --> 07:37.156
- Right, Carla?
- Yes.

07:37.240 --> 07:39.879
Thank you, Carla.
So what's it gonna be there?

07:39.960 --> 07:43.236
Head home and get some rest,
or an afternoon of senseless,

07:43.320 --> 07:46.995
mind-numbing...agony?

07:48.400 --> 07:52.188
Ah, what the hell,
I'll take the giant hip needle.

07:56.040 --> 07:59.271
There's no one around.
Time to tell her how you really feel.

07:59.360 --> 08:02.909
- You know, Elliot...
- What's up, medical dogs?

08:03.000 --> 08:04.399
You're smarter than him.

08:04.480 --> 08:07.074
Think of something clever
to get him outta here.

08:07.160 --> 08:09.594
Hey, T odd.

08:09.680 --> 08:13.992
What the hell? Did you just
throw something out into the hall?

08:15.120 --> 08:17.918
- So, anyway, Elliot...
- Hey, I found an apartment.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.788
Great! You know,
but there's no rush for you to move out.

08:21.880 --> 08:24.474
Are we gonna just live
with each other forever

08:24.560 --> 08:28.109
and anytime we feel lonely
or vulnerable, we have hot sex?

08:28.200 --> 08:31.112
- That would be stupid.
- We're both human,

08:31.200 --> 08:33.919
so staying in that situation
would be a big mistake.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.910
I know.

08:44.920 --> 08:48.708
Sometimes when you're down, you end
up taking it out on the wrong person.

08:48.800 --> 08:51.519
- Going on vacation?
- Cos I'm a janitor,

08:51.600 --> 08:54.717
so when I pack for vacation
I just pack cleaning supplies.

08:54.800 --> 08:57.234
- That's funny.
- I thought so.

08:57.320 --> 09:01.836
Actually, I'm going to speak
at my son's career day.

09:01.920 --> 09:03.478
About being a janitor?

09:03.560 --> 09:05.516
You think there
aren't kids out there

09:05.600 --> 09:07.989
that wanna grow up
to make the world sparkle?

09:08.080 --> 09:11.470
- I didn't mean it that way.
- How did you mean it?

09:14.280 --> 09:15.998
Look.

09:16.080 --> 09:18.071
What the hell are you doing?

09:21.480 --> 09:23.471
Dr Kelso,
will you just hear me out?

09:23.560 --> 09:26.950
All I'm saying is that Miss Kaye
looks like she's in great shape.

09:27.040 --> 09:31.477
Son, the woman is recovering
from major surgery on her...

09:31.560 --> 09:32.549
- Brain.
- Dammit.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.278
Why do I keep blanking on that?

09:34.360 --> 09:36.351
Now, son,
give me the real skinny.

09:36.440 --> 09:39.955
Did you pull her license or not?

09:40.040 --> 09:41.473
Yes, sir, I did.

09:47.840 --> 09:51.435
OK, I didn't tell her yet,
sir, but I swear I was gonna.

09:56.720 --> 09:58.995
Well, Mr Corman,
how'd that go for you?

09:59.080 --> 10:02.436
Horrible pain. I made sounds
like a dolphin giving birth.

10:02.520 --> 10:05.637
Dr Cox, I think you should take
a look at Mr Corman's chart.

10:05.720 --> 10:08.757
What's he got, scurvy?
There's no chance you were on a ship

10:08.840 --> 10:12.196
- in the 1 700s, is there?
- Just look at the damn chart.

10:12.280 --> 10:14.032
What is it?

10:16.840 --> 10:19.035
You're sick.

10:19.120 --> 10:22.317
- Really?
- Really.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.878
If I could get out of this place
and get away from Elliot

10:29.960 --> 10:33.430
for a while,
I could regroup, you know?

10:33.520 --> 10:36.034
But sometimes that's not so easy.

10:37.880 --> 10:41.270
- My truck was right there.
- Where is it now?

10:41.360 --> 10:45.353
You'd have to ask
the guys who stole it.

10:45.440 --> 10:48.398
Everything I owned
was in that truck.

10:48.480 --> 10:50.550
JD, I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.914
Gotta go. Good luck.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.911
Tallyho!

11:09.720 --> 11:12.109
She was going,
like, 35 miles an hour.

11:12.200 --> 11:16.239
All you saw was, like,
knuckles and a bun. Poor Bessie.

11:16.320 --> 11:19.039
What kind of grown man
still names his car?

11:19.120 --> 11:21.793
- You do.
- I've had Malik since I was 1 7.

11:21.880 --> 11:24.678
That's totally different.
Don't worry about Kelso.

11:24.760 --> 11:27.558
- His wife can drive him.
- His wife hates him.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.679
Morning, skipper.

11:37.680 --> 11:39.716
I'm so dead.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.916
Mr Corman,

11:42.000 --> 11:45.709
I'm afraid you have
Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.

11:45.800 --> 11:49.509
It is a very rare form of... cancer.

11:49.600 --> 11:54.754
Yeah... I think I had that
in college once.

11:54.840 --> 11:56.319
This is Dr Zeltzer.

11:56.400 --> 11:58.834
He is the finest oncologist
we have on staff.

11:58.920 --> 12:02.071
Really? You think so?

12:02.160 --> 12:04.720
- Yeah, I do.
- Thank you.

12:04.800 --> 12:08.759
- So, where do we start?
- Well, first off, we need to...

12:08.840 --> 12:11.832
Better than Leventhal?

12:13.280 --> 12:16.590
Leventhal's a quack.
You're the guy. You're the man.

12:16.680 --> 12:20.275
- You can do it.
- Bless you.

12:20.360 --> 12:23.557
That was some catch. The patient
shows almost no symptoms.

12:23.640 --> 12:25.676
You called for
a bone marrow biopsy?

12:25.760 --> 12:27.591
What made you
even think to do that?

12:27.680 --> 12:29.875
How about he was
unbelievably annoying,

12:29.960 --> 12:31.757
and I wanted to scare him so bad

12:31.840 --> 12:34.513
that he'd never come back
in my hospital again?

12:34.600 --> 12:38.479
Don't worry, Dr Zeltzer.
He's only kidding.

12:38.560 --> 12:42.155
Stupid. See, that's where
Leventhal has the edge.

12:42.240 --> 12:45.710
He would've got that.
The man's hilarious.

12:45.800 --> 12:48.075
Of course, he wouldn't
be laughing so hard

12:48.160 --> 12:50.628
if he knew
I was sleeping with his wife.

12:56.760 --> 12:59.911
I don't know. I didn't know
it was just your patient.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.877
- What?
- Nothing.

13:01.960 --> 13:04.758
- Then what's with the look?
- I have a crick in my neck.

13:04.840 --> 13:07.673
Since I no longer have
any furniture for my new place,

13:07.760 --> 13:09.557
I had to sleep
in my tub last night.

13:09.640 --> 13:11.039
Oh, how was your date?

13:13.920 --> 13:16.992
The ltalian people are
really good at making sauce.

13:18.760 --> 13:21.513
- Fantastic.
- You're such an ass.

13:21.600 --> 13:24.319
Could you speak up?
Mr Roberts doesn't hear so well.

13:24.400 --> 13:27.517
If you're looking for your beeswax,
it's not over here.

13:28.280 --> 13:29.872
Now she all mad.

13:29.960 --> 13:32.554
I needed your help last night
and you bailed on me.

13:32.640 --> 13:34.915
You're the one that drew
all these lines up,

13:35.000 --> 13:37.036
said that we're not
in a relationship.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.953
JD, I wasn't looking
for a boyfriend last night.

13:40.040 --> 13:42.600
I was looking for a friend.

13:44.200 --> 13:47.272
I guess she told him.
Gotta go.

13:49.720 --> 13:52.712
I was thinking about what
you said and you're right.

13:52.800 --> 13:55.189
Kids don't wanna hear
about being a janitor.

13:55.280 --> 13:57.111
- I never said that.
- It's OK.

13:57.200 --> 13:59.316
Cos instead,
I'm gonna be a doctor.

13:59.400 --> 14:02.119
I borrowed some stuff
from your locker, our locker.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.475
And, listen,
if I don't get it back to you

14:04.560 --> 14:07.358
within, like, two days,
consider it gone.

14:09.160 --> 14:12.516
I am so sorry. Miss Kaye told me
about picking up her grandkids,

14:12.600 --> 14:15.831
and she said she was feeling
fine, and I believed her.

14:15.920 --> 14:19.390
Doctor, follow me. Son, have you
used drugs in the last 48 hours?

14:19.480 --> 14:21.994
Oh, no, sir. Never use drugs.

14:22.080 --> 14:24.799
Because this shot you're
about to get could kill you

14:24.880 --> 14:28.270
- if mixed with narcotics.
- Oh, drugs. Yes, sir, all the time.

14:28.360 --> 14:30.828
See? Waiting for the tox screen,
six hours.

14:30.920 --> 14:34.310
Frightening the bejeebies
out of the riffraff, ten seconds.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.118
Everybody lies, Dr Turk,

14:36.200 --> 14:38.509
whether it's that
doobie brother in there,

14:38.600 --> 14:41.672
or, say, me when I tell my son
he can still live at the house

14:41.760 --> 14:45.639
after he graduates from art school.
And by the way, sport,

14:45.720 --> 14:50.077
Mrs Kaye doesn't have
any grandchildren.

14:55.120 --> 14:56.951
I'm still a virgin.

14:57.040 --> 15:00.555
- You're pregnant.
- Again?

15:00.640 --> 15:04.952
Since the bypass, doc,
nothing but salads.

15:05.040 --> 15:06.837
Look, it was an accident.

15:06.920 --> 15:09.514
My flashlight
didn't have any batteries.

15:09.600 --> 15:12.637
So you decided
to put your penis in there?

15:17.320 --> 15:19.151
Mr Corman, great news.

15:19.240 --> 15:21.913
Dr Zeltzer and I have
gone over your test results

15:22.000 --> 15:23.831
and your prognosis is excellent.

15:23.920 --> 15:27.117
- That's great.
- Yeah, it is.

15:27.200 --> 15:30.237
But you know what? Pat yourself
on the back all you want,

15:30.320 --> 15:32.072
but I'm not an idiot.

15:32.160 --> 15:34.116
I know that you were
screwing with me,

15:34.200 --> 15:36.794
that I come in here
thinking I'm sick when I'm not.

15:36.880 --> 15:39.269
But if you remember anything,
remember this.

15:39.360 --> 15:42.238
If I didn't have cancer,
I could have been just some guy

15:42.320 --> 15:44.788
Iooking for help
that you treated like crap.

15:44.880 --> 15:46.791
Yeah.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.914
The whole thing
is giving me an ulcer.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.719
You wanna be tested
for that too, don't you?

15:54.800 --> 15:57.189
Do you mind?

15:58.600 --> 16:01.592
Hey, Elliot...
Look, you were right.

16:01.680 --> 16:04.478
I should have been there
for you last night.

16:05.440 --> 16:06.759
Thanks.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.912
And I'm sorry you lost all your things.
That totally sucks.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.638
How are you holding up?

16:11.720 --> 16:15.110
You know what?
It was just stuff. I'm fine.

16:16.640 --> 16:19.916
This is good. It feels like
we've really turned a corner.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.992
Throw her down on that gurney
and mount her like a lion.

16:23.080 --> 16:25.071
I know.

16:27.440 --> 16:31.194
- Why didn't you stop me?
- What?

16:31.280 --> 16:33.919
Why did you let me
harass that guy?

16:34.000 --> 16:36.230
You think the fact that
you got annoyed

16:36.320 --> 16:39.915
and became insensitive with
another human being is my fault?

16:40.000 --> 16:43.993
Yeah! Look, whenever I'm about
to do some stupid-ass stuff,

16:44.080 --> 16:47.390
you're the one who calls me on it
and damn sure makes me stop.

16:47.480 --> 16:51.837
That's the way it works.
That's the way it's worked for years.

16:51.920 --> 16:54.832
Just exactly
what happened to that?

16:54.920 --> 16:58.196
I guess I just don't get as good
a read on you as I used to.

16:58.280 --> 17:00.475
Maybe all that therapy
has changed you.

17:00.560 --> 17:03.358
Please, I'm crazier than ever.

17:03.440 --> 17:07.718
During this entire conversation
I've actually been imagining myself

17:07.800 --> 17:11.395
sitting on a throne between us,
watching all of this.

17:13.160 --> 17:15.753
Maybe we're just not as close
as we used to be.

17:17.119 --> 17:19.076
Maybe.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.671
So you're just, like,
right here watching us?

17:23.760 --> 17:28.117
No. Other side. Yeah.

17:28.200 --> 17:30.998
I'm invisible to the naked eye.

17:31.080 --> 17:32.991
Of course.

17:38.680 --> 17:41.399
Why so sad, Chocolate Bear?

17:41.480 --> 17:44.631
I just don't feel like going
back to that hospital, you know?

17:44.720 --> 17:46.711
Yeah. Hey, is my breath OK?

17:46.800 --> 17:49.268
I think Lisa and l
might try talking tonight.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.828
That whole damn building
is packed with liars.

17:51.920 --> 17:53.592
It is not.

17:54.880 --> 17:56.711
Well, if the cut was that deep,

17:56.800 --> 17:59.473
I'd probably just pull your arm off.

17:59.560 --> 18:02.233
Once again...

18:02.320 --> 18:06.871
Dr Jan ltor.
Dr Jan ltor.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.389
OK, maybe you're right.
But we're doctors.

18:11.480 --> 18:13.152
That comes with the territory.

18:13.240 --> 18:15.879
Some patients don't like
telling the whole truth.

18:15.960 --> 18:18.679
Well, I don't get
why people have to do that.

18:18.760 --> 18:21.558
I don't know,
maybe it's because they're proud.

18:21.640 --> 18:24.837
Maybe it's cos they're scared.

18:24.920 --> 18:28.037
You know what?
It was just stuff. I'm fine.

18:29.920 --> 18:31.911
Maybe it's because
telling the truth

18:32.000 --> 18:34.275
would make 'em
feel too vulnerable.

18:34.360 --> 18:37.989
I guess. Dude, you're gonna
be late for Gift-Shop Girl.

18:38.080 --> 18:40.275
Oh, my God.

18:40.360 --> 18:43.158
There are a few things
I've always believed in.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.389
Flowers are good for any occasion.

18:57.520 --> 19:00.717
Nothing is more important
than making time for an old friend.

19:03.800 --> 19:06.519
Especially if the old girl's
seen better days.

19:14.720 --> 19:18.952
Cos even if it breaks
your heart to be just friends,

19:19.040 --> 19:22.669
if you really care about someone,
you'll take the hit.

19:22.760 --> 19:25.194
And it wasn't just stuff.

19:25.280 --> 19:29.114
It was all of my yearbooks
and this little pink blanket

19:29.200 --> 19:32.351
that my grandma
had crocheted for me and...

19:32.440 --> 19:36.353
Oh, and my first love letter.
My first rag doll.

19:36.440 --> 19:38.749
And I only had one picture of...

19:41.280 --> 19:43.191
And my shoes!
