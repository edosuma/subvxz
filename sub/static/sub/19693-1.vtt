00:21.760 --> 00:24.130
- Julia!

00:25.570 --> 00:27.500
Don't let him get away!

03:55.380 --> 03:57.010
I know all about
Sarah.

03:57.050 --> 03:59.920
Why have you not told
me anything about Sarah?

03:59.950 --> 04:02.850
Do you know what, I'm
just so sick and fed up

04:02.890 --> 04:05.250
of your fucking lies all the
time!

04:05.290 --> 04:09.160
You're just always lying
to me, all the time!

04:09.190 --> 04:10.160
- Listen.
- No.

04:10.190 --> 04:11.960
I don't wanna hear
anything anymore, alright?

04:11.990 --> 04:12.800
No!

04:12.830 --> 04:13.900
Fuck you!

04:13.930 --> 04:16.730
Fuck you, just get out
of my fucking house!

04:16.769 --> 04:18.700
Well, fuck you!

04:36.920 --> 04:38.550
- You alright, Danny?

04:38.590 --> 04:40.320
Can we come in, love?

04:51.200 --> 04:52.700
You all set, then?

04:54.270 --> 04:55.540
- Excited, son?

04:58.940 --> 05:02.610
We need to do something
about this mop of yours son.

05:02.650 --> 05:07.150
- Long hair will help me
stay warm during cold nights.

05:07.180 --> 05:10.420
- You're not climbing
Mount Everest, Dan.

05:10.450 --> 05:12.860
- I have to be prepared
for all eventualities,

05:12.890 --> 05:15.460
especially when dealing with
such unpredictable environments

05:15.490 --> 05:18.960
in which there will be no
one but myself to depend on.

05:18.990 --> 05:21.630
- I don't doubt that you're
prepared, hon.

05:21.660 --> 05:23.930
Mr. Precaution, aren't you?

05:25.170 --> 05:29.300
Here, take this.

05:29.340 --> 05:31.670
I've put my number in on
speed-dial.

05:31.710 --> 05:33.910
Press that one, then that one.

05:33.940 --> 05:38.110
If you want to take a picture,
you press that one, okay?

05:44.390 --> 05:48.220
This is for that sleeping bag
you want.

05:48.260 --> 05:50.760
- That's not for arcade games.

05:52.330 --> 05:53.900
It's for that sleeping bag,
okay?

05:53.930 --> 05:55.160
Yeah.

05:57.130 --> 05:59.030
- Forgetting something?

06:01.140 --> 06:02.910
- Thank--
- Thank you.

06:04.670 --> 06:07.440
Now give your mom
a kiss.

06:11.880 --> 06:13.050
- Come on.

06:13.080 --> 06:14.650
Grab your stuff.

06:14.680 --> 06:16.620
I'll drop you in town.

06:16.650 --> 06:17.650
Yeah?
- Yeah.

06:37.570 --> 06:40.410
- The fucking cheek of it,
though.

06:42.510 --> 06:44.650
- Look, she ain't worth you
getting all heated up over.

06:44.680 --> 06:47.380
She's saying I shagged
that fucking Sarah Reynolds

06:47.420 --> 06:50.520
or whatever her name is, as if
I'd shag that, she's hangin'.

06:50.550 --> 06:52.320
- I thought you did?

06:52.350 --> 06:54.660
- No, I didn't,
that's what I'm saying.

06:54.690 --> 06:56.320
Yeah but to be fair,
you have been fucking around,

06:56.360 --> 06:58.590
though, with other girls.

06:58.630 --> 06:59.800
- Yeah, but...

07:00.860 --> 07:03.200
Whose side are you on anyway?

07:03.230 --> 07:04.800
- Yours, obviously.

07:06.100 --> 07:08.800
Look, will you sit down?
You're making me nervous.

07:12.640 --> 07:15.440
What, you gonna cry now?

07:15.480 --> 07:18.110
- No, obviously not, I'm just
pissed off.

07:18.150 --> 07:19.950
- You're too soft, Nick.

07:19.980 --> 07:21.620
- What're you talking about?

07:21.650 --> 07:23.450
- You doted on Lisa,
hand and foot,

07:23.490 --> 07:25.720
and you're just gonna let
her dump ya just like that?

07:25.750 --> 07:26.920
- Yeah, well I can't get
back with her, can I?

07:26.960 --> 07:29.520
She says it's over proper
this time.

07:29.560 --> 07:31.790
- I'll fuck her up for ya,
if you like.

07:31.830 --> 07:33.430
Never did like her.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.370
What did you see in her anyway?

07:39.400 --> 07:40.970
She ain't all that.

07:42.270 --> 07:45.410
Don't know,
she's, well, she's clever,

07:45.440 --> 07:48.740
not like the usual rats
you get stuck with.

07:50.050 --> 07:54.220
- You think she's little-miss-fucking-perfect,
don't ya?

07:55.080 --> 07:57.250
You don't know her at all.

07:59.290 --> 08:01.120
Oh, and you do, do ya?

08:01.160 --> 08:03.560
- Well, I know she's not
as sweet

08:03.590 --> 08:06.090
and innocent as she makes out.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.700
- What're you talking about?

08:11.730 --> 08:13.670
- Don't worry.

08:13.700 --> 08:15.140
- No.

08:15.170 --> 08:16.000
Tell me.

08:19.170 --> 08:23.350
- Well, you know that she
said that you were her first?

08:24.880 --> 08:27.550
You know, that she was a virgin?

08:28.550 --> 08:30.850
Yeah, she was a virgin.

08:30.890 --> 08:31.720
What're you fucking laughing at?

08:31.750 --> 08:33.159
If you know something, tell me.

08:33.190 --> 08:34.020
- Come on.

08:35.260 --> 08:37.890
She'd been with lads before you.

08:40.100 --> 08:41.600
How many?

08:42.700 --> 08:43.669
How many?

08:43.700 --> 08:47.370
- Fucking hell, I don't
know the exact number!

08:47.400 --> 08:49.100
Well who, then?

08:49.140 --> 08:50.370
- Well, I don't know.

08:50.410 --> 08:52.810
I don't know all their names.

08:54.440 --> 08:58.610
But I know for a fact that
she fucked that spastic kid.

09:00.480 --> 09:01.480
Danny Evans.

09:04.720 --> 09:06.320
- Who?

09:06.350 --> 09:09.290
- Danny Evans, you know,
from the school?

09:09.320 --> 09:10.660
Everybody knows.

09:12.590 --> 09:15.400
- That's a fucking lie,
that's bullshit!

09:15.430 --> 09:17.630
When's that supposed to
have happened?

09:17.670 --> 09:19.270
Like, last summer.

09:19.300 --> 09:20.540
What, she didn't tell you
about it?

09:20.570 --> 09:21.770
- What, that she fucked a mong?

09:21.800 --> 09:23.040
No, she didn't.

09:25.510 --> 09:27.280
- Look trust me, mate,
she's a slut.

09:27.310 --> 09:29.280
- Fuck off, you're a slut.
- How am I slut?

09:29.310 --> 09:32.150
Look, I'm trying to help
you here.

09:32.980 --> 09:33.820
Fuck sake.

09:34.880 --> 09:35.950
- Okay, okay.

09:38.290 --> 09:39.820
Do you know where he lives?

09:39.860 --> 09:43.660
- Who, Danny?
- Well, obviously Danny, yeah!

09:43.690 --> 09:44.860
Why?

09:46.230 --> 09:49.230
- Julia, stop fucking me around.

09:49.260 --> 09:51.000
If you know where he lives,
then tell me.

09:51.030 --> 09:53.200
Now do you, or do you not?

09:55.000 --> 09:56.870
- Yeah, I do.

09:56.910 --> 09:58.640
So, tell me.

10:03.010 --> 10:04.180
- No.

10:04.210 --> 10:07.150
- I said, fucking tell me.

10:07.180 --> 10:09.350
- Look, why do you care?

10:09.380 --> 10:13.290
She didn't know how to
treat you right anyway.

10:13.320 --> 10:15.360
- Oh, and you do?

10:15.390 --> 10:16.520
- Yeah.

10:16.560 --> 10:17.830
I do.

10:17.860 --> 10:19.330
Fuck off.

10:20.360 --> 10:23.630
- Sometimes, Nick,
I fucking hate ya.

10:23.670 --> 10:25.170
I fucking hate ya.

10:28.100 --> 10:32.270
Why was Lisa and those other
girls good enough for you,

10:34.080 --> 10:35.080
but I'm not?

10:36.440 --> 10:37.350
- Fuck off.

10:39.750 --> 10:40.580
Come on.

10:53.300 --> 10:54.200
- Fuck sake.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.700
- Are you coming or what?

10:58.930 --> 11:00.040
Fucking hell.

11:02.770 --> 11:03.610
- Fine.

12:24.090 --> 12:27.090
- Yeah, but what I see
is that it's, you know,

12:27.120 --> 12:29.290
a new start for all of us.

12:30.430 --> 12:33.660
No, I don't, I don't, I don't.

12:33.700 --> 12:36.300
Yeah, no, I know but...

12:36.330 --> 12:39.800
No, fuck sake, no, I don't want
to buy it.

12:42.870 --> 12:44.140
What, Calvin?

12:44.170 --> 12:46.540
Yeah, no, he's doing fine.

12:46.570 --> 12:51.110
Well, I've enrolled him into
the school down the road, but,

12:51.150 --> 12:53.980
well, to be honest with you,
he's not really been here.

12:54.020 --> 12:56.650
No, he's been out all the time.

13:49.070 --> 13:52.910
- Do you have that stock
bag in extreme green?

13:56.410 --> 13:57.480
- Um, no.

13:57.510 --> 13:58.680
Sorry, mate.

13:58.710 --> 14:01.120
All our stock's out.

14:01.150 --> 14:02.900
- You might have one out
the back.

14:03.700 --> 14:05.200
- We don't, sorry.

14:11.710 --> 14:13.810
Would you like to take
advantage of our offer on

14:13.840 --> 14:15.240
insect repellent?

14:21.620 --> 14:25.020
- Diethyltoluamide.

14:25.050 --> 14:27.260
You may know it as DEET.

14:27.290 --> 14:30.690
First introduced during
the Second World War

14:30.730 --> 14:34.630
and used extensively
during the Vietnam War.

14:34.660 --> 14:37.230
It's a known hazardous
material to fresh-water fish.

14:37.270 --> 14:39.270
I shouldn't risk it.

14:39.300 --> 14:41.200
Okay, that's 18.99,
please.

14:41.240 --> 14:44.640
- I'm going camping at the
Calton Lake.

14:44.670 --> 14:46.880
- That's nice.

14:46.910 --> 14:48.180
18.99.

14:48.210 --> 14:50.250
- It's for my
Duke of Edinburgh Award.

14:50.280 --> 14:52.950
It's only bronze at the moment,
but I'm going to get silver,

14:52.980 --> 14:54.420
probably next year.

14:54.450 --> 14:58.390
- That's awesome, mate, but
you still need to pay for this.

14:58.420 --> 15:01.690
And I do have other
customers to serve.

15:04.630 --> 15:05.460
Thank you.

15:09.100 --> 15:13.270
Excuse me, your change?

15:16.740 --> 15:17.870
Fucking idiot.

16:01.550 --> 16:03.150
- Yes, bruv, what you up to?

16:03.190 --> 16:04.020
- Guess.

16:05.020 --> 16:06.690
Packet but shit and that,
you good?

16:06.720 --> 16:08.890
Yeah, yeah.

16:08.920 --> 16:11.430
- Party was good the
other night, wasn't it?

16:11.460 --> 16:12.360
- What's that Claire
girl saying?

16:12.400 --> 16:13.460
She been talking about me
and that, yeah?

16:13.500 --> 16:15.100
- Who's this Claire?
- Bennett.

16:15.130 --> 16:16.060
- You shagged Claire Bennett?

16:16.100 --> 16:17.500
That's fucking hanging,
how did that happen?

16:17.530 --> 16:19.100
- Got her in me home,
one thing led to another.

16:19.130 --> 16:19.970
- Mate.

16:21.100 --> 16:22.470
- What you want anyway?

16:22.510 --> 16:25.440
- Fuck all, just tryin' to find
this kid.

16:25.470 --> 16:26.710
- Why is that?

16:26.740 --> 16:27.710
- Nick wants to fuck him up.

16:27.740 --> 16:30.610
- Yeah but he's a
fucking pedophile, Julia.

16:30.650 --> 16:31.480
- What?

16:34.020 --> 16:36.120
- Yeah, his name's Danny.

16:38.950 --> 16:41.490
- Blatant pedophile, but
gets away with it because

16:41.520 --> 16:43.330
apparently he's a bit simple in
the head.

16:43.360 --> 16:44.930
- Well, what's he done?

16:44.960 --> 16:45.960
- All sorts.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.900
You got a little sister,
don't ya?

16:48.930 --> 16:49.970
- Yeah.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.030
How old is she?

16:51.070 --> 16:52.030
- Eight.

16:52.070 --> 16:53.670
- Eight?

16:53.700 --> 16:55.470
Fucking hell, mate, you
better keep her locked up.

16:55.500 --> 16:57.340
Julia's little sister seen this
kid hanging round her school

16:57.370 --> 16:59.710
before half-term, ain't she?

17:00.580 --> 17:03.210
- Yeah and she's the same age
as yours.

17:03.250 --> 17:06.380
Look, he needs sorting out
before he does it again.

17:06.420 --> 17:08.250
- What, again,
he's done it before?

17:08.280 --> 17:09.119
- Yeah.

17:10.349 --> 17:12.660
A couple of years ago, right,
this little girl was missing

17:12.690 --> 17:17.160
around here, police find her
in the woods tied up, she...

17:17.190 --> 17:19.290
Well, she'd been raped,
you know.

17:19.329 --> 17:22.230
Never found out who did it,
but they knew it was him,

17:22.260 --> 17:23.300
if you know what I mean.

17:23.329 --> 17:24.500
- What, so the police just let
him go?

17:24.530 --> 17:25.569
There was no evidence or--
- Fucking hell.

17:25.599 --> 17:28.000
I don't know all the details,
do I?

17:28.040 --> 17:29.810
But it was definitely him.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.870
- Yeah, yeah and now,

17:31.910 --> 17:34.810
me fucking sister is terrified
of going back to school.

17:34.840 --> 17:36.510
So we're just gonna scare
him a little bit, you know,

17:36.550 --> 17:38.510
sort him out, right?

17:38.550 --> 17:39.880
- Yeah.

17:39.920 --> 17:43.520
Make sure he don't go back to
the school again, you know?

17:43.550 --> 17:45.150
What're you saying?
Come with us.

17:45.190 --> 17:46.320
- Oh, fuck it,
I've got shit to do.

17:46.360 --> 17:47.360
- Got shit to do, have ya, yeah?

17:47.390 --> 17:50.460
What if it's your sister
next time, eh?

17:50.490 --> 17:52.060
Your little sister.

17:53.200 --> 17:55.700
And you had the chance to
finish it and you didn't.

17:55.730 --> 17:56.570
Eh?

17:58.230 --> 18:00.070
So I'll ask you again.

18:01.470 --> 18:03.040
What're you saying?

18:04.070 --> 18:05.670
- Fuck it, alright.

21:07.960 --> 21:09.020
- Hello.

21:09.060 --> 21:10.360
- Alright, Mrs. Evans?

21:10.390 --> 21:12.630
We're looking for Danny,
is he home?

21:12.660 --> 21:14.500
No, sorry.

21:14.530 --> 21:16.670
- You wouldn't happen to
know where he is, would ya?

21:16.700 --> 21:18.100
Sorry, we're mates from school.

21:18.130 --> 21:20.540
We're supposed to be
meeting him.

21:20.570 --> 21:23.310
- He's out camping, he's
doing his DOE Award.

21:23.340 --> 21:25.770
- Of course, yeah, so
we've missed him then.

21:25.810 --> 21:27.040
It's just he was looking
to borrow some equipment,

21:27.080 --> 21:28.710
that's all, never mind.

21:28.740 --> 21:29.980
Well I
think he has everything.

21:30.010 --> 21:33.250
He's even taken his dad's
fishing rod.

21:33.280 --> 21:36.250
- Right so he'll be going down
fishing by the river will he?

21:36.280 --> 21:37.350
- Maybe.

21:37.390 --> 21:39.050
Something like that, anyway.

21:39.090 --> 21:41.020
Also, try the arcade.

21:41.060 --> 21:43.090
He might have stopped off there,
too.

21:43.130 --> 21:45.360
- Well, if we've missed him,
not to worry.

21:45.390 --> 21:48.900
Just let him know we called,
we'll see him soon, yeah?

21:48.930 --> 21:51.830
Have you tried
his mobile?

21:51.870 --> 21:53.640
- We ain't got his number.

21:53.670 --> 21:55.870
Well I can
give it to you if you want.

21:55.900 --> 21:57.570
- Listen, it's fine.

21:58.570 --> 21:59.570
We'll find him.

21:59.610 --> 22:00.580
Cheers.

22:00.610 --> 22:02.110
- If he's thrown all his
money on those machines,

22:02.140 --> 22:05.250
give him a clip from me, okay?

22:05.280 --> 22:06.620
- Yeah, we will.

22:09.790 --> 22:13.920
- Bye, Mrs. Evans,
have a lovely weekend.

22:13.960 --> 22:18.130
Ah, ain't she lovely?

23:39.940 --> 23:41.480
- Do you think she knows?

23:41.510 --> 23:43.010
- Knows what?

23:43.050 --> 23:44.950
- That her son's a
kiddie-fiddler.

23:44.980 --> 23:46.180
- Of course she fuckin' knows.

23:46.210 --> 23:47.380
Why do you think she don't want
him going round the arcades?

23:47.420 --> 23:48.820
- That is fucking crazy.

23:48.850 --> 23:50.320
Would have thought she kept him
locked up.

23:50.350 --> 23:51.790
- Yeah well, let's hope we find
him first,

23:51.820 --> 23:53.520
before he finds some
little girl.

23:53.560 --> 23:55.620
- How are we gonna get to him
if we don't know where he is?

23:55.660 --> 23:57.060
Could be fucking anywhere.

23:57.090 --> 23:58.990
- Did you not just hear what his
mom said?

23:59.030 --> 24:00.300
He's gone fishing.

24:00.330 --> 24:03.200
So he's either gonna be
at the river or the lake.

24:03.230 --> 24:05.400
- That's fucking miles away
and I ain't got no money.

24:05.430 --> 24:06.840
- Right, so we'll go the arcade,

24:06.870 --> 24:09.740
and if we don't find him,
we'll take it from there.

24:09.770 --> 24:11.210
Fuck.
- Alright.

24:11.240 --> 24:12.310
Fucking hell.

25:20.710 --> 25:21.880
Alright, mate?

25:27.620 --> 25:29.890
- Alright, mate, 10 crismers
and a bottle of rum, please.

25:29.920 --> 25:33.920
Yeah, I just need
to see your ID, please, mate.

25:33.960 --> 25:38.330
Are you taking the
piss? I look older than you.

25:38.360 --> 25:40.100
Yeah, Challenge 25,
you know?

25:40.130 --> 25:41.230
You what?

25:41.260 --> 25:45.500
- Like, if you look under
25, I need to see your ID.

25:45.530 --> 25:47.270
- Fucking hell, here.

25:50.140 --> 25:51.670
That's a provisional that,
mate, you've gotta take that.

25:51.710 --> 25:52.880
- No, I don't.

25:52.910 --> 25:54.710
I can refuse whoever I want
and if you're gonna show me

25:54.740 --> 25:58.680
a driving license, then
I need to see a full one.

25:58.710 --> 26:00.520
Yeah but you've served
me in here before with that.

26:00.550 --> 26:01.780
- No, I didn't.

26:06.490 --> 26:09.790
Look, it's not gonna happen,
mate.

26:09.820 --> 26:10.660
Hey!

26:12.360 --> 26:13.360
Knob!

26:20.600 --> 26:24.770
* I hang around with fiends
selling powdered dreams *

26:27.940 --> 26:29.880
* Yeah

26:31.610 --> 26:34.120
* Yo

26:34.150 --> 26:37.590
* Man, I hang around with
fiends selling powdered dreams *

26:37.620 --> 26:40.960
* Laying down to sleep, it
clicks in and they now believe *

26:40.990 --> 26:44.390
* Paint lines depicting
victory in strange times *

26:44.430 --> 26:47.660
* Dreams are unreal and
real at the same time *

26:47.700 --> 26:49.260
* So I never sleep with the
light on *

26:49.300 --> 26:51.070
* Embrace that energy that they
hide from *

26:51.100 --> 26:53.840
* Python's tight grip, wide
fist, life is just a trip *

26:53.870 --> 26:55.470
* I wanna make the most while I
still can *

26:55.500 --> 26:57.110
* Real badly seeking
adrenaline *

26:57.140 --> 26:58.910
* Feel bad never
reaping the benefits *

26:58.940 --> 27:01.140
* Dumb head buried deep
in the elements *

27:01.180 --> 27:02.910
* I remain in the flames
and the smoke *

27:02.950 --> 27:04.580
* Twist around,
I change and evolve *

27:04.610 --> 27:06.310
* You hung yourself with
that chain that you hold *

27:06.350 --> 27:08.120
* Blistering heat that came from
the cold *

27:08.150 --> 27:11.520
* Pick me up, I'm feeling low,
have been since a week ago *

27:11.550 --> 27:13.190
* I just need some
beats to roll *

27:13.220 --> 27:15.620
* I sit and hug the
speaker so I'm feeling it *

27:15.660 --> 27:18.530
* Now we involve in the
freezing cold *

27:18.560 --> 27:20.200
* Hands are numb,
can't even hold *

27:20.230 --> 27:22.660
* I'm seeming young,
I'm feeling old *

27:22.700 --> 27:26.270
* Feeling old, feeling old

27:27.200 --> 27:31.270
* Seeming young,
I'm feeling old *

27:56.500 --> 27:59.830
* Pick me up, I'm feeling low,
have been since a week ago

27:59.870 --> 28:01.470
* I just need some
beats to roll *

28:01.500 --> 28:03.970
* I sit and hug the
speaking so I'm feeling it *

28:04.010 --> 28:06.840
* Now we involve in the
freezing cold *

28:06.870 --> 28:08.510
* Hands are numb,
can't even hold *

28:08.540 --> 28:11.080
* I'm seeming young,
I'm feeling old *

28:11.110 --> 28:14.680
* Feeling old, feeling old

28:22.860 --> 28:24.860
- So why'd you move down here
anyway, Cal?

28:24.890 --> 28:27.460
- My old man was fucking my
mom about, so, she decided

28:27.500 --> 28:31.000
it was best to move down
here with my cousin and that.

28:31.030 --> 28:34.940
- Fuck it, sooner or later
parents split up anyway.

28:34.970 --> 28:36.670
- You reckon?

28:36.700 --> 28:39.110
- Mm, dead-right, mate.

28:39.140 --> 28:41.110
I don't know one person round
here whose parents are still

28:41.140 --> 28:44.180
together and it's always because
they shagged someone else.

28:44.210 --> 28:46.580
- Coming from the kid whose
parents are proper loved up.

28:46.610 --> 28:48.880
And who the fuck
asked you?

28:48.920 --> 28:50.850
- Don't listen to him, Cal.

28:50.890 --> 28:52.990
He's just bitter 'cause he
got dumped.

28:53.020 --> 28:55.320
- Did you get dumped, bro?
- Don't worry about it.

28:55.360 --> 28:57.290
- Crying, he was.
- How the fuck was I crying?

28:57.330 --> 28:58.730
Shut the fuck up.

29:02.760 --> 29:04.500
- Pretty bad around Besret.

29:04.530 --> 29:07.740
Parents wanted to move away
before they even split up.

29:07.770 --> 29:09.370
- Why, how bad was it?

29:09.400 --> 29:10.640
- Bad, bro.

29:10.670 --> 29:12.840
Coming back from town on a bus,

29:12.870 --> 29:15.280
literally a guy stabbed me for
no reason.

29:15.310 --> 29:16.410
- Fucking hell,
no reason at all?

29:16.440 --> 29:17.780
- No reason at all.

29:17.810 --> 29:19.210
Reported it to the police, the
police said they thought it

29:19.250 --> 29:23.820
might be gang related
but obviously, who knows?

29:23.850 --> 29:25.990
- Yeah but that could
happen anywhere, mate.

29:26.020 --> 29:28.460
- Does it fuck, bro, that
shit don't happen in Cotswold.

29:28.490 --> 29:30.130
That's why I wanna go
to university.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.930
Bring my kids up in a nice area.

29:31.960 --> 29:33.130
Fuck living around there.

29:33.160 --> 29:34.160
- Uni?

29:34.200 --> 29:36.400
You ain't goin' to uni,
none of us are.

29:36.430 --> 29:38.370
Yeah, innit,
good luck with that.

29:38.400 --> 29:41.140
Speak for yourselves,
mate.

29:41.170 --> 29:43.910
- Look, your parents are as
broke as mine.

29:43.940 --> 29:46.470
Can your dad afford
the fees, can your mom?

29:46.510 --> 29:48.480
No, but you've
got ways around it.

29:48.510 --> 29:50.780
You've got grants, funding.

29:51.850 --> 29:52.880
- Are you for real?

29:52.910 --> 29:56.750
Look, face it, uni is for
the posh twats, simple.

29:56.780 --> 29:58.050
- Come on, I'm bored of this,
let's go.

29:58.090 --> 30:01.590
- Let's start that, bro, let's
start that.

31:50.900 --> 31:51.730
- Woo!

32:00.840 --> 32:01.640
- Nah.

32:12.820 --> 32:14.520
- What the fuck are you doing?

32:14.550 --> 32:16.050
I've been trying to win
on that all morning.

32:16.090 --> 32:17.260
- Have ya, yeah?

32:17.290 --> 32:18.320
Well why don't you try and
fucking win it back, ya prick.

32:18.360 --> 32:21.390
Here.

32:21.430 --> 32:25.560
It's not gonna
fucking pay out now, is it?

32:30.540 --> 32:32.270
- Right, I can't find that
mong anywhere but here you are.

32:32.310 --> 32:34.340
I've got some cash, ah, ah.

32:34.370 --> 32:36.440
One for you, one for you.

32:36.480 --> 32:37.880
Back in a minute.

32:44.580 --> 32:45.780
What do you want, Nick?

32:45.820 --> 32:47.950
- You fucked a spastic.
- What?

32:47.990 --> 32:51.120
- You heard me, you fucked that
mong kid Danny fucking Evans

32:51.160 --> 32:52.190
or whatever his name is.

32:52.230 --> 32:54.130
You told me you were a
virgin, you fucking slag.

32:54.160 --> 32:56.430
Nick, you're fucking
childish.

32:56.460 --> 32:58.230
- Yeah, well now because of
you, that Danny Evans is gonna

32:58.260 --> 33:00.130
get his fucking head kicked
in, so I hope you're happy.

33:00.170 --> 33:02.000
Please,
just delete my number,

33:02.030 --> 33:04.940
and never speak to me again.

33:04.970 --> 33:06.640
- Oh, you fucking...

33:18.020 --> 33:19.250
- Don't know about that.

33:19.290 --> 33:21.690
- Oi, bus ain't gonna be here
for another half an hour.

33:21.720 --> 33:25.490
I'll be over there.
- Alright, we'll crack on.

33:36.770 --> 33:37.800
- How'd you do this?

33:37.840 --> 33:41.140
- You didn't do it fucking
beginner, that's why.

33:41.170 --> 33:44.010
Why'd you choose fucking hard?

33:44.040 --> 33:45.940
- This is shit.

33:45.980 --> 33:49.620
- I'm perfect, me.
- Girls like this.

33:49.650 --> 33:52.520
You look like such a
fucking knob.

33:52.550 --> 33:54.390
- Yeah, you can't even do it.
- Fuck off.

33:54.420 --> 33:56.260
- I'm beating you.
- Fuck off.

33:56.290 --> 33:59.260
Mate, I'm beating you.
- I'm beating you.

34:05.200 --> 34:06.800
- I won that, I swear.

34:06.830 --> 34:09.540
Fucking play something
else, play something else!

34:09.570 --> 34:11.639
Where's the bag?

34:12.639 --> 34:15.010
We got a half-hour,
what do you wanna play?

34:15.040 --> 34:18.210
- Where's Nick?
- He's gone over there.

34:24.219 --> 34:25.650
- Boom, fuck off.

34:27.350 --> 34:29.120
- That was fun, that.

34:49.739 --> 34:51.239
- Hello?
- Hi, Mom.

34:52.239 --> 34:54.550
- Hello, lovely, how are you
holding up?

34:54.580 --> 34:56.010
- Good.

34:56.050 --> 34:57.480
- I got your picture.

34:57.520 --> 34:59.550
I showed it to Dad, too.

34:59.590 --> 35:02.320
Hang on,
he wants to talk to you.

35:04.160 --> 35:05.360
- Hi, son.

35:05.390 --> 35:07.360
How's that fishing rod
holding up?

35:07.390 --> 35:08.760
You caught anything?

35:08.790 --> 35:09.860
No.

35:10.830 --> 35:12.100
- Well, if you do
catch anything,

35:12.130 --> 35:14.530
remember to save some
for your mom and dad.

35:14.570 --> 35:16.500
- No, I'll put it back.

35:18.640 --> 35:21.840
It's catch-and-release
here, I'll get into trouble.

35:21.870 --> 35:24.010
Ah, you'd have
been alright.

35:24.040 --> 35:26.980
I don't want to
disrupt the fragile ecosystem.

35:27.010 --> 35:29.080
"Ecosystem."

35:29.110 --> 35:30.180
You're funny.

35:31.280 --> 35:33.050
So, what's next on the agenda?

35:33.090 --> 35:35.120
You gonna go hunt some deer?

35:35.150 --> 35:37.320
No.

35:37.360 --> 35:40.690
I'm going to build a
fire and have some food,

35:40.730 --> 35:43.160
and then I'll go in the tent
and read.

35:43.200 --> 35:44.630
- Oh, good.

35:44.660 --> 35:46.630
You take care of yourself.

35:46.670 --> 35:48.470
We're very proud of ya.

35:48.500 --> 35:51.140
Hang on, your mom wants to talk.

35:52.270 --> 35:55.010
- What time do you want us
to come and get you tomorrow?

35:55.040 --> 35:58.280
I'll be packed
and ready at 11 a.m.

35:58.310 --> 36:00.950
- Okay, where are you?

36:00.980 --> 36:03.920
At the car park
near Dad's fishing spot.

36:03.950 --> 36:05.250
- Right.

36:05.280 --> 36:07.520
Well, you look after
yourself out there tonight,

36:07.550 --> 36:10.460
and if you have any
problems, you call me, okay?

36:10.490 --> 36:11.360
Yeah.

36:11.390 --> 36:12.220
Mm, yeah.

36:45.660 --> 36:47.890
What do you think
of this place so far, then?

36:47.930 --> 36:49.130
Yeah, it's alright.

36:49.160 --> 36:50.800
Doesn't look like I'm gonna
get stabbed on this bus anyway.

36:50.830 --> 36:52.000
- What're we gonna do
about this prick, then?

36:52.030 --> 36:53.570
We need to get organized.

36:53.600 --> 36:55.930
- I don't know, trash some
of his shit or something?

36:55.970 --> 36:57.440
- Trash his shit?

36:57.470 --> 36:59.440
Are you fucking kidding
me, how old are you?

36:59.470 --> 37:01.710
I don't know,
this was your idea.

37:01.740 --> 37:03.780
- And what about you?

37:03.810 --> 37:06.380
- I don't know, fuck him up, I
suppose.

37:06.410 --> 37:07.780
Look, we have to find him first.

37:07.810 --> 37:09.280
- Yeah and we will find him.
- And if we don't?

37:09.310 --> 37:10.280
- Well, fucking hell.

37:10.320 --> 37:12.120
We'll just get him on
another day, won't we?

37:12.150 --> 37:15.390
- So we're just gonna run up
to this guy with no excuse?

37:15.420 --> 37:16.820
- No excuse?

37:16.860 --> 37:18.060
Hey, no excuse?

37:18.090 --> 37:20.590
Are you forgetting why we're
doing this whole fucking thing?

37:20.630 --> 37:21.860
I wouldn't be surprised if we
turn up there he's got another

37:21.890 --> 37:23.530
kid with him and then
what're you gonna do, eh?

37:23.560 --> 37:24.530
- If there's some dodgy shit,

37:24.560 --> 37:26.900
then of course I'll do something
about it.

37:26.930 --> 37:29.000
- What do you reckon, Jules?

37:29.030 --> 37:33.040
I reckon Calvin here is a
little pussy.

37:33.070 --> 37:35.370
- Yeah, I think he might be.

37:36.980 --> 37:38.110
- Where's all this come from,
bro?

37:38.140 --> 37:39.240
I don't even know what
the plan is.

37:39.280 --> 37:40.410
- The plan's simple.

37:40.450 --> 37:44.580
We're gonna make sure that
kid don't leave that place.

37:48.450 --> 37:51.460
- He's serious about this,
ain't he?

37:53.190 --> 37:55.660
Look, Julia, I don't
really want to do this.

37:55.690 --> 37:57.800
- Look, we do whatever he wants.

37:57.830 --> 37:58.760
Come on.

38:44.340 --> 38:48.350
- I'm not stopping to
roll another spliff, mate.

38:50.420 --> 38:52.520
- Fucking proper creepy,
look at that.

38:52.550 --> 38:54.650
- You don't need to be
scared about them there.

38:54.690 --> 38:55.990
- No?
- Everything is dead.

38:56.020 --> 38:58.420
It's the alive you've got to
be worried about, trust me.

38:58.460 --> 39:00.560
- Why's that?
- Why?

39:00.590 --> 39:01.430
- Yeah.

39:03.730 --> 39:04.930
- Imagine a ghost trying to
attack you.

39:04.960 --> 39:08.700
Just give him a straight
uppercut to the jaw.

39:15.310 --> 39:16.910
- Do you believe in ghosts?

39:16.940 --> 39:18.140
Fuck, I do.

39:18.180 --> 39:19.880
It scares the shit out of me.

39:19.910 --> 39:21.010
Huh?

39:21.050 --> 39:24.120
Yeah, mate, there is, I'm
telling ya.

39:41.770 --> 39:43.040
Are you coming?

39:58.520 --> 40:01.020
- Fucking hell, bro,
chill with that.

40:01.050 --> 40:03.120
- You need to relax, you.

40:04.590 --> 40:06.890
- So what do you do
around here anyway?

40:06.930 --> 40:10.230
- Get stoned, get pissed,
whatever.

40:10.260 --> 40:12.200
- People come here to
fuck as well.

40:12.230 --> 40:15.170
- What, fuck on a
dirty forest floor?

40:15.200 --> 40:17.000
- Right little bitch, you,
aren't ya?

40:17.040 --> 40:18.540
- Not really, bro, just
wouldn't want to get my clothes

40:18.570 --> 40:21.610
muddy and fuck on a
forest floor.

40:21.640 --> 40:23.740
- Julia's been banged enough
times around here, haven't ya?

40:23.780 --> 40:24.610
- Shut up.

40:24.640 --> 40:25.840
- Give her a spliff and liters
of cider

40:25.880 --> 40:29.920
and she's fucking anyone's.
- Funny, ain't ya?

40:33.450 --> 40:36.690
- So is this where that girl
got raped?

40:36.720 --> 40:37.760
- You what?

40:37.790 --> 40:40.430
- You know, that girl that
Danny raped or whatever.

40:40.460 --> 40:41.960
Was it here?

40:41.990 --> 40:43.760
- Yeah, yeah, somewhere
around here, I think, yeah.

40:43.800 --> 40:45.160
It's hangin', ain't it?

40:45.200 --> 40:47.600
But don't worry, he's not gonna
get a chance to do it again.

41:36.920 --> 41:38.680
Right, well he's not here.

41:38.720 --> 41:41.120
- Well where is this guy?
- Fuck knows.

41:41.150 --> 41:42.720
- Oh, this is fucking pointless,
man.

41:42.760 --> 41:44.990
We're not gonna find him.
- Right, listen.

41:45.020 --> 41:46.830
We'll go down the lake, if
he's not there, we'll go home.

41:46.860 --> 41:47.890
How's that?

41:47.930 --> 41:49.960
- Can we not just chill
for a bit and have a beer?

41:50.000 --> 41:51.260
- Look, where are you going?

41:51.300 --> 41:55.130
- Fucking hell, for a
piss, if that's alright.

42:20.490 --> 42:23.060
- What did you mean earlier on
the bus?

42:23.100 --> 42:26.300
About Danny not leaving this
place.

42:26.330 --> 42:28.830
- Exactly what it sounded like.

42:28.870 --> 42:30.170
Why?

42:30.200 --> 42:32.140
Not backing out like Calvin,
are ya?

42:32.170 --> 42:34.840
- No, I'm not, but Calvin's
gonna realize you've been

42:34.870 --> 42:36.740
lying about Danny being a
pedo and you're gonna look--

42:36.780 --> 42:38.010
- Listen, I'm not being made
to look

42:38.040 --> 42:40.610
like a dickhead by nobody.

42:40.650 --> 42:42.110
Retard or not, alright?

42:42.150 --> 42:44.480
So fuck Calvin and fuck you.

42:47.250 --> 42:48.490
- Fuck sake.

42:55.330 --> 42:57.730
- Right, come then, let's go
and check this fucking lake.

42:57.760 --> 42:59.400
- Alright, if he's not there,
we're going back then, yeah?

42:59.430 --> 43:00.330
- Oh, yeah.

43:05.870 --> 43:07.440
- You alright?
- Mm.

43:53.850 --> 43:55.060
This was a
waste of time, wasn't it?

44:02.790 --> 44:04.630
- Hang on, who's that?

44:08.100 --> 44:11.340
- Oh fuck knows, bro, that
could be anyone, that.

44:11.370 --> 44:13.040
- I think that might be him,
you know.

44:13.070 --> 44:13.910
- Yeah?

44:15.810 --> 44:18.210
Come on then, let's find out.

44:36.590 --> 44:37.700
Here, let's hide these first.

44:37.730 --> 44:39.400
We don't wanna scare him too
soon, do we?

44:39.430 --> 44:41.770
Have a bit of fun first, eh?

45:17.540 --> 45:19.900
Alright, Danny boy?

45:19.940 --> 45:21.910
It's alright, chill out.

45:21.940 --> 45:23.780
Nice little spot you got here,
Dan.

45:23.810 --> 45:27.980
- It's not too shabby, Danny,
it's nice and clean in there.

45:29.180 --> 45:30.780
Oi, where's your
manners?

45:30.820 --> 45:33.590
Get up and offer the lady a
seat.

45:35.790 --> 45:37.520
- Cheers, Danny love.

45:41.430 --> 45:43.460
- Do you remember Julia from
your school?

45:43.500 --> 45:45.460
Hey, year above ya?
- Mm, no.

45:45.500 --> 45:46.300
- No?
- No.

45:50.070 --> 45:50.900
- So...

45:53.310 --> 45:56.310
Why'd you have to come here of
all places?

45:56.340 --> 45:58.710
- I'm due my
Duke of Edinburgh Award.

45:58.740 --> 46:02.150
- The what?
- Julia, go and get us a beer.

46:09.320 --> 46:10.160
Cheers.

46:18.130 --> 46:20.300
Oh, fucking hell, that's warm.

46:20.330 --> 46:21.170
Hangin'.

46:22.700 --> 46:24.940
Do you want a drink?
- No.

46:24.970 --> 46:27.110
- You sure?

46:27.140 --> 46:27.700
It's supposed to be good for the
nerves.

46:28.170 --> 46:30.500
- No, thank you.

46:33.470 --> 46:35.010
What's wrong
with him?

46:35.040 --> 46:35.870
- A lot.

46:38.640 --> 46:40.350
I've been looking for you, Dan.

46:40.380 --> 46:41.310
- Yeah?

46:41.350 --> 46:44.350
- Been wanting to talk to ya.
- Yeah.

46:45.620 --> 46:48.490
- Do you know a girl called
Lisa Mitchell?

46:48.520 --> 46:51.090
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I thought you did.

46:51.120 --> 46:52.330
How do you know her?

46:52.360 --> 46:53.960
- Lisa's my friend.

46:54.860 --> 46:56.930
- Yeah, yeah, so I heard.

46:57.800 --> 46:59.000
- Yeah.

46:59.030 --> 47:02.700
- It's just, eh, I used
to go out with Lisa.

47:03.900 --> 47:05.500
People have been telling
me that you fucked her.

47:06.670 --> 47:08.540
What're you fucking laughing at?

47:08.570 --> 47:11.880
- I wouldn't do that,
Lisa's my friend.

47:11.910 --> 47:14.680
- Yeah, so you keep saying.

47:14.710 --> 47:17.220
What kind of a friend, though?

47:18.820 --> 47:19.890
Ah, where are you going?

47:19.920 --> 47:21.590
I ain't finished talking
to you yet.

47:21.620 --> 47:22.620
- Yeah what,
you got some big plans

47:22.660 --> 47:23.490
we're interrupting or something?

47:23.520 --> 47:26.060
- Yeah, Lisa coming over
tonight, is she?

47:26.090 --> 47:27.430
- No.
- No.

47:27.460 --> 47:30.330
But I bet you'd like it
if she did, wouldn't ya?

47:30.360 --> 47:31.200
Eh?

47:34.600 --> 47:37.100
It's a common cobra.

47:39.770 --> 47:40.910
- Really?

47:40.940 --> 47:43.810
- The wedged hole there
provides excellent protection

47:43.840 --> 47:45.510
in high cross-winds.

47:48.380 --> 47:51.220
The aluminum poles are
incredibly resilient

47:51.250 --> 47:52.920
to harsh conditions.

47:55.190 --> 47:56.520
Do you have one?

47:57.660 --> 47:59.460
- The fuck do I want one of
these for?

47:59.490 --> 48:00.730
I'm a city boy.

48:05.530 --> 48:07.100
- Do you fish?

48:07.130 --> 48:09.000
Old people fish,
mate.

48:09.030 --> 48:10.470
- Not always.

48:10.500 --> 48:12.940
- Danny, stop fucking about over
there.

48:12.970 --> 48:14.540
Come here a minute, I want to
talk to you.

48:17.010 --> 48:21.350
You're into your, um, your
clubs and that, aren't ya?

48:21.380 --> 48:23.980
You know, boy scouts or
whatever.

48:24.020 --> 48:25.580
- No, boys brigade.

48:26.590 --> 48:27.590
- Yeah aren't you always
hanging around

48:27.620 --> 48:28.890
with kids half your age?

48:28.920 --> 48:31.860
- Yeah, fucking hell, what is
that about?

48:31.890 --> 48:32.830
It's time you started
hanging around

48:32.860 --> 48:35.560
with people your own age, son.

48:35.590 --> 48:39.000
I'll tell you what, you can
be in our club if you want.

48:39.030 --> 48:40.330
- I don't know.

48:40.370 --> 48:42.000
Oh yeah, come
on, it'll be a laugh!

48:42.030 --> 48:43.270
- Yeah.

48:43.300 --> 48:45.540
All you gotta do is
pass the initiation.

48:45.570 --> 48:46.570
- Okay.

48:46.610 --> 48:48.240
- Oh, that was easy.

48:50.010 --> 48:52.350
But it comes in three parts.

48:53.880 --> 48:56.550
The first part is nice and easy.

48:58.820 --> 49:01.120
Gotta down that in one.

49:01.150 --> 49:04.020
- I don't know, my parents would
be mad.

49:04.060 --> 49:05.190
Oh fuck off, Dan,
your parents aren't gonna

49:05.220 --> 49:07.560
find out all the way out here,
are they?

49:07.590 --> 49:09.800
Main part of our code,
init, Cal?

49:09.830 --> 49:11.360
- What?

49:11.400 --> 49:13.000
You know, we don't
grass on people, do we?

49:13.030 --> 49:14.100
- Nah, never.

49:15.670 --> 49:19.510
- Go on, show us you're
a man, down it in one.

49:21.410 --> 49:24.910
Oi, don't waste it, I said down
it in one!

49:24.940 --> 49:25.810
That's it.

49:25.840 --> 49:27.210
That's it, go on.

49:27.250 --> 49:28.280
Go on.

49:28.310 --> 49:29.150
Go on!

49:30.820 --> 49:31.650
Go on.

49:32.920 --> 49:33.750
That's it.

49:37.490 --> 49:38.290
Good lad.

49:39.360 --> 49:42.030
All the way, all the way,
all the way.

49:42.060 --> 49:43.930
There we go, see?

49:43.960 --> 49:45.560
Not so bad, was it?

49:46.630 --> 49:47.470
- No.

49:48.570 --> 49:49.840
No.

49:49.870 --> 49:51.440
- Now, what's next?

49:53.040 --> 49:53.940
Cal?
- What?

49:54.870 --> 49:56.880
- What's next?
- I don't know.

49:56.910 --> 50:00.980
- Fucking hell, are you
getting involved or what?

50:02.820 --> 50:04.320
- He has to strip.

50:06.790 --> 50:08.290
- Yeah, good idea.

50:10.290 --> 50:12.090
Did you hear that, Dan?

50:12.120 --> 50:13.690
You've gotta strip.

50:15.330 --> 50:16.160
- No.

50:17.030 --> 50:18.000
I don't want to.

50:18.030 --> 50:19.670
- What do you mean you don't
want to?

50:19.700 --> 50:20.670
You want to be in our club,
don't you?

50:20.700 --> 50:22.640
We all had to do it, didn't we,
didn't we?

50:22.670 --> 50:24.400
- Yeah, no, no, yeah.

50:26.840 --> 50:31.540
- Sorry do you think you have
some sort of a choice in this?

50:33.380 --> 50:36.010
You shag my girlfriend, you
sure as hell can get naked.

50:36.050 --> 50:37.780
Now get naked!
- Nick--

50:37.820 --> 50:40.220
Fuck off, now do it.

50:46.120 --> 50:46.960
Good lad.

50:51.060 --> 50:51.900
Come on!

51:05.510 --> 51:06.580
And the rest.

51:08.180 --> 51:09.680
- Please, no.
- Listen.

51:09.720 --> 51:10.750
I'm gonna give you three
seconds,

51:10.780 --> 51:12.150
then you're gonna
get slapped again.

51:12.180 --> 51:13.350
Three.

51:13.390 --> 51:15.990
Nick, this
is going too far, man.

51:16.020 --> 51:18.960
- Told you he was a pussy,
didn't I?

51:18.990 --> 51:22.730
- But he might have a point,
Nicholas, look at him.

51:22.760 --> 51:24.260
- Not you as well.

51:24.300 --> 51:27.300
Hey, looks like you got
a fucking fan club here.

51:27.330 --> 51:30.000
I tell you what, dry your
fucking eyes, you lard ass.

51:30.040 --> 51:32.940
We'll skip to the last part.

51:32.970 --> 51:34.410
- What last part?

51:37.180 --> 51:38.510
- He's gotta take our
Julia here,

51:38.540 --> 51:40.150
in your little tent
and fuck her.

51:40.180 --> 51:42.580
- You what?
- Yeah, you heard.

51:42.620 --> 51:43.850
- Fuck off.

51:43.880 --> 51:46.280
I'm not fucking a spastic,
are you off your head?

51:46.320 --> 51:47.490
- Well, you don't usually
mind who you shag,

51:47.520 --> 51:49.350
as long as they've got a
fucking pulse.

51:49.390 --> 51:51.620
- Yeah, fuck you, Nick.
- Now Nick, just chill out.

51:51.660 --> 51:55.530
Are you on this
retard's side now as well, eh?

51:55.560 --> 51:57.100
- I was just saying.
- Just, you're just saying.

51:57.130 --> 51:58.530
Just saying, what are ya saying?

51:58.560 --> 52:00.400
Fuck all, that's what.

52:01.700 --> 52:03.140
Now, where was I?

52:04.470 --> 52:05.640
Oh, yeah.

52:05.670 --> 52:09.840
You've gotta take Julia here
into your tent and fuck her.

52:09.880 --> 52:11.280
Uh, no.

52:13.080 --> 52:14.150
- If you can shag Lisa,

52:14.180 --> 52:16.580
you can sure as hell shag Julia,
yeah?

52:16.620 --> 52:18.620
Yeah?
- Please, please.

52:21.550 --> 52:23.820
- You lot, I'm only joking!

52:23.860 --> 52:26.020
Fucking hell, here,
you fucking lard arse,

52:26.060 --> 52:30.230
take your clothes and go and
get changed, go on, fuck off.

52:40.770 --> 52:42.110
Pair of pussies.

52:46.950 --> 52:47.780
Come on.

53:17.510 --> 53:19.710
Gotta have the right
tools to do the job, bro.

53:19.750 --> 53:20.710
- What?

53:20.750 --> 53:23.520
- The job, ending that
little pedo over there.

53:23.550 --> 53:26.450
No, he ain't no
pedophile.

53:26.490 --> 53:27.820
- You what?

53:27.850 --> 53:29.860
You actually defending
this little mong again?

53:29.890 --> 53:32.460
- No, I just don't think
he did what you said.

53:32.490 --> 53:34.760
- You what?
- All that shit about Lisa.

53:34.790 --> 53:36.190
Is that the real reason
we're here?

53:36.230 --> 53:39.570
You think that kid, that kid
fucked her?

53:41.730 --> 53:43.400
- Look, we're not lying, Cal.

53:43.440 --> 53:45.400
He might seem harmless
to you, but he ain't.

53:45.440 --> 53:47.840
That's how he gets away with it!

53:47.870 --> 53:49.740
- You've been in this from
the beginning, Calvin.

53:49.780 --> 53:50.580
We need ya.

53:50.610 --> 53:52.510
- What the fuck do you need
me for?

53:52.550 --> 53:54.010
- Man up!

53:54.050 --> 53:55.480
Imagine what would happen
to your little sister

53:55.510 --> 53:56.410
if people like us weren't
around--

53:56.450 --> 53:57.720
- Don't bring my sister into
this--

53:57.750 --> 53:59.180
- Yeah, you're getting mad,
are ya?

53:59.220 --> 54:00.920
Yeah, get mad.

54:00.950 --> 54:02.290
You're so convinced
he's innocent,

54:02.320 --> 54:05.490
why didn't you stop me smacking
him, eh?

54:05.520 --> 54:06.590
- Fuck this.

54:06.630 --> 54:07.760
- Where do you think
you're going?

54:07.790 --> 54:10.860
- You're fucking mad,
that kid's done fuck-all!

54:10.900 --> 54:12.360
- Yeah, well good luck
finding your own way back,

54:12.400 --> 54:13.900
you fucking prick.

54:30.180 --> 54:32.380
What, do you want to go
after him, do ya, eh?

54:32.420 --> 54:34.090
- No, of course I don't.
- So are you with me?

54:34.120 --> 54:37.860
- Yeah, of course I am.
- Right, give me that.

54:40.760 --> 54:41.660
Here, here.

54:50.640 --> 54:51.470
Come on!

55:00.050 --> 55:01.450
- Please.

55:01.480 --> 55:02.310
Please.

55:06.620 --> 55:07.690
Please.

55:42.660 --> 55:43.560
- Grab him.

56:14.390 --> 56:16.920
Sorry about that, Danny mate.

56:16.960 --> 56:17.790
You okay?

56:36.140 --> 56:40.250
Think you've learned your
listen now, haven't ya?

56:48.850 --> 56:49.690
- Yes.

56:58.060 --> 56:59.560
Can I go home now?

57:00.530 --> 57:01.370
- Yeah.

57:02.840 --> 57:04.200
Go on, then.

57:04.240 --> 57:06.070
Let's get you home.

57:06.100 --> 57:07.540
You alright?

57:07.570 --> 57:08.910
You got it?

57:08.940 --> 57:09.840
That's a nasty look, that.

57:31.830 --> 57:32.660
Get up.

57:34.300 --> 57:38.470
I know you fucked her and
that's all that matters.

57:58.020 --> 58:01.490
Go and stick that in him.

58:01.530 --> 58:04.630
Julia, you started this
whole thing,

58:04.660 --> 58:07.230
you're gonna have to finish it.

58:11.640 --> 58:13.040
What are you doing?

58:13.070 --> 58:14.270
- I'm thinking.

58:14.310 --> 58:16.570
- You're thinking,
thinking about what?

58:16.610 --> 58:20.480
- Look, it's different
when he's just lying there!

58:20.510 --> 58:21.580
- Just do it.

58:24.880 --> 58:26.050
Fucking do it!

58:34.690 --> 58:35.530
Go on.

59:24.010 --> 59:24.840
Yes, yes!

59:54.240 --> 59:57.640
Time to put you out of your
misery, Danny.

59:57.680 --> 59:59.910
- No.
- It won't hurt a bit.

01:00:08.250 --> 01:00:11.490
- What the fuck have you done?

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:12.360
- Calvin.

01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:16.760
Nice of you to finally join us,
mate.

01:00:16.790 --> 01:00:19.030
Come here, I won't hurt ya.

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:34.550
Now finish him.

01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:38.420
Go on.

01:00:40.550 --> 01:00:42.550
Think of your little sister.
- Fuck off.

01:00:42.590 --> 01:00:44.060
- Hm?

01:00:44.090 --> 01:00:45.690
Her little hands on his
big cock.

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:48.490
- Fuck off, he's had enough!

01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:49.560
Enough!

01:00:49.590 --> 01:00:52.800
- Listen, if we don't
fucking finish him now,

01:00:52.830 --> 01:00:55.100
he's gonna grass us all up!

01:00:55.130 --> 01:00:56.530
- I didn't touch him.

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:57.800
- You didn't touch him.

01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:01.470
Listen to me, you're as big a
part of this as we are, mate!

01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:04.410
- I am not a murderer
and he is not a pedo.

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:05.880
This has got way out of hand!

01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:07.480
- Yeah, well fuck you!

01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:09.250
Just 'cause I got a bit of balls

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:10.820
to do something about it, eh?

01:01:10.850 --> 01:01:12.020
- Yeah.
- Nick, shut up.

01:01:12.050 --> 01:01:16.220
- Killing an innocent kid's
really needed, ain't it?

01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:17.060
- Innocent?

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:18.720
Innocent!
- Yeah.

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:21.730
He fucked your ex and you can't
handle it!

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:24.330
Yeah?

01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:28.600
- Get off him, Nick!

01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:32.700
What are you doing?

01:01:33.610 --> 01:01:35.870
Hey, this is stupid!

01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:37.780
Nick!

01:01:41.550 --> 01:01:43.680
What the fuck are you doing?

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:45.620
Get off of him, Nick!

01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:48.120
Get the fuck off of him!

01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:50.160
Get the fuck off of him!

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:52.620
Fucking hell.

01:01:55.930 --> 01:01:57.200
What the fuck?

01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:58.730
Oi, what the fuck?

01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:02.430
Get off him!

01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:07.640
What the fuck are you doing?

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:15.480
Get the fuck off him!

01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:16.680
For fuck sake!

01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:25.820
He's gone.

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:28.460
He's fucking gone!

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:31.260
- Fuck!

01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:32.530
Fuck.

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:34.400
Where's he gone?

01:02:34.430 --> 01:02:35.800
I don't fucking know!

01:02:35.830 --> 01:02:37.340
- Well get after him, then!

01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:38.340
- Fucking hell!

01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:39.200
- Fuck!

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:33.360
Julia!

01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:36.730
Don't let him get away!

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:38.000
- Fucking hell.

01:03:58.350 --> 01:04:00.190
- Shut the fuck up!

01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:02.290
I've gotta hide ya.

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.160
I'm tryin' to hide ya!

01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:09.390
Shut the fuck up!

01:04:10.530 --> 01:04:12.430
- Please, please, don't please.

01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:14.230
- Shut the fuck up!

01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:15.730
Calvin!

01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:17.700
- Nick, just leave him.

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:21.370
- I'm sorry, Danny.

01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:23.510
I'm sorry.

01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:28.380
I'm sorry.

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:44.100
- What are you doing?

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:46.600
Nick.

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:15.390
Nick!

01:05:16.890 --> 01:05:20.530
Stop it, Nick!

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:26.740
Please, stop it.

01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:30.110
Please.

01:05:41.290 --> 01:05:42.120
- I can't.

01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:16.290
I'm sorry.

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:55.660
- He said 11, right?

01:08:55.689 --> 01:08:56.520
- Yeah.

01:08:57.630 --> 01:09:00.830
He's probably having trouble
taking the tent down.

01:09:00.859 --> 01:09:01.700
- I guess.

01:09:04.770 --> 01:09:06.800
We could always go
and surprise him.

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:09.340
I've always wanted to know
what this place looked like.

01:09:09.370 --> 01:09:13.540
Boys only.

01:09:18.450 --> 01:09:21.550
Hello, your call
cannot be taken at the moment.

01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:25.020
So please leave your
message after the tone.

01:09:25.050 --> 01:09:26.290
- Answer phone.

01:09:27.390 --> 01:09:30.290
- Don't stress,
he'll be back soon.

01:09:35.330 --> 01:09:36.160
Fine.

01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:38.600
Let's go help him.

01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:43.130
* I hang around with fiends
selling powdered dreams *

01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:48.200
* Yeah

01:15:49.970 --> 01:15:52.470

01:15:55.310 --> 01:15:56.580
* selling powdered dreams

01:15:56.610 --> 01:15:59.810
* Laying down to sleep, it
clicks in and they now believe *

01:15:59.850 --> 01:16:03.220
* Paint lines depicting
victory in strange times *

01:16:03.250 --> 01:16:06.620
* Dreams are unreal and
real at the same time *

01:16:06.650 --> 01:16:08.160
* So I never sleep with the
light on *

01:16:08.190 --> 01:16:09.920
* Embrace that energy that they
hide from *

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:12.530
* Python's tight grip, wide
fist, life is just a trip *

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:14.330
* I wanna make the most while I
still can *

01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:15.930
* Real badly seeking
adrenaline *

01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:17.700
* Feel bad never
reaping the benefits *

01:16:17.730 --> 01:16:20.070
* Dumb head buried
deep in the elements *

01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:21.740
* I remain in the flames
and the smoke *

01:16:21.770 --> 01:16:23.470
* Twist around,
I change and evolve *

01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:25.210
* You hung yourself with
that chain that you hold *

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:27.010
* Blistering heat that came from
the cold *

01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:30.410
* Pick me up, I'm feeling low,
have been since a week ago *

01:16:30.450 --> 01:16:31.980
* I just need some
beats to roll *

01:16:32.010 --> 01:16:34.480
* I sit and hug the
speaker so I'm feeling it *

01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:37.350
* Now we involve in the
freezing cold *

01:16:37.390 --> 01:16:39.050
* Hands are numb,
can't even hold *

01:16:39.090 --> 01:16:41.560
* I'm seeming young,
I'm feeling old *

01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:45.160
* Feeling old, feeling old

01:16:46.030 --> 01:16:50.100
* Seeming young,
I'm feeling old *

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:18.830
