15:10.933 --> 15:13.652
. . .l think you need to bring
your daughter in.

15:19.053 --> 15:21.248
PAULA:
l, uh. . . .

15:21.613 --> 15:23.808
l left home around 6 a.m.

15:23.973 --> 15:27.124
l didn't wake up Raymond.
He liked to sleep late.

15:27.293 --> 15:29.329
Did he talk about meeting anybody
this morning?

15:29.693 --> 15:30.682
No.

15:30.853 --> 15:34.289
-You know any of his friends?
-l don't know that l'd call them friends.

15:34.453 --> 15:37.445
l mean, l knew a couple
of his business partners but. . . .

15:37.613 --> 15:40.605
-No. Friends? Not lately.
-Why's that?

15:41.213 --> 15:42.566
l don't know.

15:42.733 --> 15:46.885
Raymond didn't talk much about it. l just
knew that they weren't getting along.

15:47.093 --> 15:48.731
So who were the partners?

15:48.893 --> 15:52.647
Well, the only one that l actually knew
was Jerry Littman.

15:52.813 --> 15:56.806
He was a jobber.
Heather's Heavenly Bridal Wear.

15:56.973 --> 15:58.929
l did their fall show.

15:59.093 --> 16:02.244
That's how l met Raymond.
He was hitting on all the models.

16:02.493 --> 16:03.812
Yeah?

16:05.893 --> 16:08.566
Can you think of anyone else
Raymond didn't get along with?

16:08.733 --> 16:13.329
l don't know. You know,
l wasn't seeing him for that long.

16:13.493 --> 16:15.688
l mean, l never even met his family.

16:15.853 --> 16:19.766
But, l mean, you know who they are.

16:19.933 --> 16:21.127
Who?

16:21.293 --> 16:21.413
-His father's totally mobbed up.
-How do you know that?

16:21.413 --> 16:25.326
-His father's totally mobbed up.
-How do you know that?

16:25.493 --> 16:28.166
PAULA: Raymond bragged about it.
-So that didn't bother you?

16:28.333 --> 16:31.325
No. Why would it bother me?

16:31.493 --> 16:34.371
You know how those wise guys are.
They like to spend their money.

16:34.533 --> 16:37.093
We'd go to the clubs
and we were treated like royalty.

16:37.253 --> 16:38.845
Before we even got to the table. . .

16:39.013 --> 16:42.528
. . .Raymond would knock off, like,
$50 and think nothing of it.

16:46.253 --> 16:49.245
-He ever say he was afraid of anybody?
-No.

16:49.933 --> 16:53.528
Raymond would never admit to me
that he was afraid of anybody.

16:53.693 --> 16:55.923
That just wasn't like him.

16:57.093 --> 17:00.483
Aside from Raymond,
you seeing anybody else, Paula?

17:01.493 --> 17:05.008
l work a 1 2-hour day.
l come home and l collapse.

17:06.173 --> 17:08.767
-l'm a little wiped-out. Can l go home?
-No.

17:09.292 --> 17:11.284
Just sit here and relax a while, okay?

17:12.093 --> 17:16.290
Can we get you something? Like some
coffee, or a Coke, something like that?

17:16.453 --> 17:18.489
Yeah. Yeah, a diet Coke.

17:19.653 --> 17:23.646
And can l have something to eat?
A yogurt, salad?

17:24.453 --> 17:27.286
Yeah. There's a store
around the corner here, right?

17:27.453 --> 17:29.330
l'll take a walk.
l'll get you a yogurt.

17:32.493 --> 17:34.324
You think there's a second boyfriend?

17:34.493 --> 17:36.882
Maybe she'll tell us after she eats.

17:37.053 --> 17:39.203
What does that mean?
l'm moving too slow for you?

17:39.373 --> 17:42.046
l don't cater for them
until after they give something up.

17:42.213 --> 17:43.771
Everybody's got their own approach.

17:43.933 --> 17:46.163
Raymond Martarano's lawyer
is at the catching bench.

17:46.333 --> 17:49.962
One of you guys talk to him.
l've got Organized Crime in my office.

17:50.133 --> 17:54.092
Look, Andy, you worked a long time
with your last partner.

17:54.493 --> 17:57.849
Me and you, we're not always
gonna start on the same page.

17:58.013 --> 18:01.130
Yeah, l'd have scared her more
about the goombahs.

18:01.293 --> 18:04.410
lt's better to cooperate with us
than to take a beating from them.

18:04.573 --> 18:06.643
But like you say,
everybody works their own way.

18:07.053 --> 18:08.850
lf there was another boyfriend. . .

18:09.013 --> 18:11.243
. . .maybe she wouldn't want him
to take the beating.

18:11.413 --> 18:13.483
That's a way to go.

18:14.653 --> 18:17.645
-l hope you're not the sensitive type.
-Sensitive? Not usually.

18:17.813 --> 18:20.805
So you take this lawyer,
l'll go get the yogurt, huh?

18:24.173 --> 18:25.162
l'm Det. Sipowicz.

18:25.333 --> 18:28.848
Phillip Fox representing Raymond
Martarano. Somewhere we could talk?

18:29.013 --> 18:30.924
How about right here?

18:31.093 --> 18:33.653
All right, detective,
let's not make this adversarial.

18:33.853 --> 18:36.686
l'm simply asking the police
to provide some basic facts. . .

18:36.853 --> 18:40.163
. . .so that Mr. Martarano
can begin to understand this tragedy.

18:40.333 --> 18:42.927
Any chance l could speak
directly with Mr. Martarano. . .

18:43.093 --> 18:44.606
. . .and get some basic facts back?

18:44.973 --> 18:47.487
He's grief-stricken.
He's in no condition to talk to you.

18:47.653 --> 18:52.966
Go tell Mr. Martarano Raymond Jr.
was shot leaving an apartment building.

18:53.133 --> 18:56.330
One of the bullets ricocheted
and killed an 82-year-old woman.

18:56.613 --> 18:59.810
You tell him that we're at the preliminary
stage in our investigation.

18:59.973 --> 19:02.168
Any developments, we'll let him know.

19:02.333 --> 19:06.531
Det. Sipowicz, whatever your prejudices
may be about Raymond Martarano. . .

19:06.693 --> 19:09.605
. . .this is a father who just lost
his eldest son.

19:09.773 --> 19:12.207
Hey, lawyer Fox, you want me
to give up some names. . .

19:12.373 --> 19:16.207
. . .so your client can kick ass
and kill another innocent bystander?

19:16.373 --> 19:19.126
You tell Mr. Martarano
l am sorry for his loss. . .

19:19.293 --> 19:22.285
. . .and he will get the cooperation
that he gives.

19:22.453 --> 19:26.446
-l'll report our conversation.
-And l'll go back to work.

19:44.013 --> 19:45.366
-Ms. Savino?
-Yes.

19:45.573 --> 19:46.767
l'm Det. Simone.

19:46.933 --> 19:48.924
Oh, yes, you were there this morning.

19:49.093 --> 19:53.450
l came to see how things were going,
and maybe provide some information.

19:54.453 --> 19:57.843
Why don't we sit over here?
What sort of information?

19:58.013 --> 20:01.210
After you left, l remembered some facts
that might help on the case.

20:01.613 --> 20:05.288
l remembered something
my mother told me the day before.

20:05.453 --> 20:08.968
That she'd seen a black pickup truck
not normally parked on the block. . .

20:09.133 --> 20:12.250
. . .that was there two times
or more last week.

20:12.413 --> 20:15.530
-Uh-huh.
-Well, you see what l mean?

20:15.693 --> 20:19.163
She might have seen something
pertaining to this truck. . .

20:19.333 --> 20:23.087
. . .and with the people involved,
maybe they're the ones who did it.

20:23.253 --> 20:26.290
This morning, when l went out, it was
there. A black pickup truck. . .

20:26.453 --> 20:28.250
. . .with tinted windows.

20:28.413 --> 20:30.165
You know, so people can't see in.

20:30.333 --> 20:33.086
Right. Black pickup,
tinted glass, front and rear?

20:33.253 --> 20:35.847
Just rear. l wrote down the license.

20:37.613 --> 20:40.491
l got to tell you, it's highly
unlikely there's a connection. . .

20:40.653 --> 20:42.325
. . .but we'll check it out.

20:42.493 --> 20:44.609
Should l photograph the truck,
do you think?

20:44.773 --> 20:46.525
l think we have all we need on that.

20:51.373 --> 20:55.366
The more you love someone, the harder
it is to understand when they're taken.

20:55.533 --> 20:59.606
l know there's a chance
it was an accident, just an accident.

20:59.773 --> 21:01.684
l tell myself that.

21:02.373 --> 21:04.762
But then l think, well. . .

21:05.653 --> 21:08.133
. . .how many people's mothers
get shot by accident?

21:08.133 --> 21:09.805
. . .how many people's mothers
get shot by accident?

21:10.693 --> 21:14.003
-lt doesn't make any sense.
-No, it doesn't.

21:15.493 --> 21:18.087
-l'm sorry if l wasted your time.
-No, not at all.

21:18.253 --> 21:20.562
-You got my card.
-You mean l should've called you?

21:20.733 --> 21:24.123
No, l'm just reminding you
that you've got it.

21:24.293 --> 21:26.602
Call me. Get in touch with me
whenever you want.

21:26.773 --> 21:28.889
All right, thank you.

21:41.853 --> 21:45.243
Detective, in all the hubbub,
we didn't get to say hello.

21:45.413 --> 21:46.812
-Bobby Simone.
-Donna Abandando.

21:46.973 --> 21:48.531
Pleased to meet you.

21:48.693 --> 21:50.604
SlPOWlCZ:
That was the last time you saw him?

21:50.893 --> 21:52.292
Yeah, thanks.

21:53.013 --> 21:56.926
So Jerry Littman with two T's
says Ray Jr. was a deadbeat.

21:57.093 --> 22:00.130
He stiffed him on dough they were
going into business with. . .

22:00.293 --> 22:03.012
. . .but Ray had such a bright personality,
such a happy time. . .

22:03.173 --> 22:06.529
. . .with the bims and the recreational
stimulants that Jerry couldn't stay mad.

22:06.693 --> 22:09.287
-What did he say about Paula?
SlPOWlCZ: She modeled for him.

22:09.453 --> 22:11.569
She's from Elizabeth, New Jersey.

22:11.773 --> 22:15.686
And before Raymond, she was
seeing some guy that hauls bricks.

22:15.853 --> 22:19.971
He came into Littman's show room with
cement on his shoes. Come on, let's go.

22:21.613 --> 22:23.490
-He tell you this guy's name?
-Uh-uh.

22:23.653 --> 22:26.372
But he says Paula and him
were a pretty heavy item.

22:27.293 --> 22:28.885
Listen. . .

22:30.013 --> 22:32.527
. . .it's a good thing
you left room for the boyfriend.

22:36.933 --> 22:38.412
SlMONE:
How are we doing, Paula?

22:38.573 --> 22:40.564
Oh, great. Thanks.
Yeah, it's real great.

22:41.053 --> 22:41.733
-Got your yogurt.
-When can l go?

22:41.733 --> 22:43.052
-Got your yogurt.
-When can l go?

22:44.013 --> 22:45.287
Shouldn't be too long now.

22:45.573 --> 22:48.883
Look, if you have any questions,
just ask them.

22:49.053 --> 22:52.204
You know, l'm kind of going crazy
in here. What is the problem?

22:52.373 --> 22:55.171
My problem, Paula,
is that l just don't believe you.

22:56.013 --> 22:58.049
Well, l don't understand
what you're saying.

22:58.213 --> 23:00.647
You don't even believe
that l was seeing Raymond?

23:00.813 --> 23:02.724
No, l heard all that.

23:03.013 --> 23:06.369
l heard all about the clubs
and how you were treated like royalty.

23:06.533 --> 23:08.922
But then we hear
about Elizabeth, New Jersey.

23:09.093 --> 23:10.572
So?

23:10.733 --> 23:14.089
What's that supposed to mean?
Everyone comes from somewhere, right?

23:14.253 --> 23:16.687
-You go back every weekend?
-My family's over there.

23:16.853 --> 23:18.605
Just your family, huh?

23:18.773 --> 23:21.367
Hey, look, don't play with me,
all right?

23:21.533 --> 23:23.763
lf we go back there
and ask questions about you. . .

23:23.933 --> 23:26.606
-. . .we won't find out something?
-There's nothing to find.

23:26.813 --> 23:30.123
l sat over there for years
and l looked across this river. . .

23:30.293 --> 23:33.683
. . .and this is where l wanted to be,
and l wanted to be here with Raymond.

23:33.853 --> 23:36.970
So don't you go telling me
that l didn't care about him.

23:37.133 --> 23:39.203
Oh, l wish he was still alive.

23:39.613 --> 23:39.693
All right, Paula. Listen to me, all right?

23:39.693 --> 23:42.048
All right, Paula. Listen to me, all right?

23:42.213 --> 23:45.569
Whoever did this, we're not the only
people looking for him. Understand?

23:46.173 --> 23:48.482
-Raymond's family?
-Whoever did this. . .

23:48.653 --> 23:52.248
. . .he'd have a lot better chance in here
with us than he would on the street.

23:52.413 --> 23:54.643
Now, if it's somebody
that you cared about--

23:58.693 --> 24:00.968
lt is somebody
that you cared about, right?

24:01.133 --> 24:04.808
l understand that. Maybe if it was me,
l'd be here doing the same thing.

24:04.973 --> 24:06.725
But l want you to think about something.

24:06.893 --> 24:10.363
l want you to think about the position
that this person is in.

24:10.533 --> 24:12.364
Somebody out there's gonna find him.

24:12.533 --> 24:14.091
And. . .

24:14.693 --> 24:16.172
-. . .he'd go to jail?
-No.

24:16.333 --> 24:20.087
Nobody can say anything like that.
We don't know the circumstances.

24:20.253 --> 24:24.565
lf Raymond had a gun and threatened
him, that could totally change things.

24:27.373 --> 24:29.523
Who's your boyfriend, Paula?

24:31.973 --> 24:33.645
Come on. Look, l know you love him.

24:33.813 --> 24:36.532
You're trying to protect him.
l respect that.

24:36.693 --> 24:38.809
But what you're doing here
is not gonna help him.

24:39.333 --> 24:41.483
lt's gonna get him killed.

24:43.893 --> 24:46.885
lt's not--
lt's not his fault.

24:47.693 --> 24:51.481
lt's my fault. lt was because
of everything that l was doing.

24:56.293 --> 24:58.727
His name is Paddy Perkins.

24:59.533 --> 25:01.728
l can tell you where he works.

25:03.493 --> 25:05.085
Good.

25:17.733 --> 25:21.089
SlPOWlCZ:
Hey. Hey.

25:23.373 --> 25:25.329
We're looking for Paddy Perkins.

25:25.493 --> 25:28.963
He's an oiler. He's over there.
You need a hardhat to go over there.

25:29.133 --> 25:30.327
Yeah, okay.

25:30.693 --> 25:32.763
-Hey, you Paddy?
WORKER: No.

25:38.453 --> 25:39.806
Hey, Paddy around?

25:39.973 --> 25:43.409
-Yeah, that's me.
SlPOWlCZ: You got a minute?

25:43.973 --> 25:45.964
You're gonna have to take
a ride with us.

25:46.133 --> 25:48.010
PADD Y: What's?
-Your name was mentioned. . .

25:48.173 --> 25:49.526
. . .in an investigation.

25:49.693 --> 25:53.402
Come to the station house with us
and we'll straighten it out. Come on.

25:53.573 --> 25:54.722
Everything all right?

25:54.893 --> 25:57.168
These guys are cops.
They want me to go with them.

25:57.333 --> 25:59.642
-What do you want to do?
-Why, you writing a book?

25:59.893 --> 26:02.646
-lt's all right. l'll go.
CRANE OPERATOR: l know the law.

26:02.813 --> 26:04.690
They got no warrant,
you don't have to go.

26:04.853 --> 26:08.892
Hey, Paddy's cooperating here. You stay
out of this. Nobody asked you anything.

26:09.053 --> 26:11.283
l work with the guy.
l'm telling him his rights.

26:11.613 --> 26:14.889
Yeah? What about your rights
to getting your ass kicked. . .

26:15.053 --> 26:18.170
. . .getting collared and winding up
in night court? Want those?

26:18.693 --> 26:20.923
-Let's go.
-lt's all right.

26:21.853 --> 26:22.842
l didn't think so.

26:23.933 --> 26:25.571
Come on.

26:30.893 --> 26:35.284
Allison, your mother told us that there
are some things going on in your home.

26:35.453 --> 26:39.241
l don't know why she came here.
l don't know why she brought me here.

26:39.413 --> 26:43.247
She told us your father's been sleeping
with you in your bedroom.

26:43.413 --> 26:46.564
ls your father having relations
with you, Allison?

26:46.733 --> 26:48.803
Don't l have the right
to talk to an attorney?

26:48.973 --> 26:50.884
No one's accusing you of anything.

26:51.053 --> 26:53.487
lf anyone did anything wrong,
it would be your father.

26:53.653 --> 26:55.052
My mother lies.

26:55.213 --> 26:57.204
Why would she lie
about something like that?

26:57.373 --> 26:58.772
l don't know, but it's not true.

26:58.933 --> 27:01.572
Your father isn't having relations
with you?

27:01.733 --> 27:03.086
No.

27:03.253 --> 27:06.086
Why don't l bring your mother in here?

27:06.973 --> 27:08.201
Allison. . .

27:08.773 --> 27:11.571
. . .why don't l bring
your mother in here?

27:13.733 --> 27:15.166
Okay.

27:22.933 --> 27:25.891
Could you come in
for a second, Mrs. Davis?

27:32.093 --> 27:33.765
Sit down.

27:42.373 --> 27:45.888
Allison said her father
hasn't been intimate with her.

27:46.693 --> 27:50.402
-How can you do this?
-l have to do this. lt can't go on.

27:50.573 --> 27:52.882
You know what they'll do.
They'll take me away.

27:53.053 --> 27:54.645
Allison, that isn't true.

27:58.173 --> 28:01.643
lt can't go on, Allison.
l can't live with it anymore.

28:02.213 --> 28:04.488
You can't make me say anything.

28:04.653 --> 28:07.042
You can put me in jail,
but l'll never say anything.

28:07.213 --> 28:10.330
Honey, please.
l'm only trying to help you.

28:10.693 --> 28:12.126
No.

28:12.293 --> 28:13.806
No.

28:13.973 --> 28:16.089
l'm not afraid. l'll go to jail.

28:16.253 --> 28:18.483
LESNlAK:
No one is going to put you in jail. . .

28:18.933 --> 28:21.606
. . .but you can't hide from this
any longer.

28:21.773 --> 28:26.324
We have to do something about this.
Don't you want it to stop?

28:31.493 --> 28:33.961
Tell me what he did to you.

28:35.453 --> 28:37.523
He touched me.

28:38.893 --> 28:41.361
-And he showed me how to touch him.
-Oh, God.

28:47.213 --> 28:49.249
What could l do?

28:49.813 --> 28:51.883
He's my father.

28:55.093 --> 28:56.526
When did it start?

28:56.973 --> 29:00.124
l don't know exactly.
lt was before l got my periods.

29:00.533 --> 29:04.367
When he began sleeping with you,
what did he do?

29:06.653 --> 29:08.883
He does everything.

29:10.573 --> 29:12.803
You know, everything.

29:20.613 --> 29:22.251
SlPOWlCZ:
Here, sit down.

29:22.413 --> 29:25.166
-So am l under arrest?
SlPOWlCZ: No, you're not under arrest.

29:25.333 --> 29:27.893
So, what's going to get me
back to the job?

29:28.053 --> 29:30.613
What's this about?
l'm losing a day's pay here.

29:30.773 --> 29:34.209
Paddy, where were you
between 6:30 and 8 this morning?

29:34.373 --> 29:36.933
That's easy. l was sitting
in traffic in the tunnel.

29:37.413 --> 29:40.052
-Did you drive in with anybody?
-No.

29:40.213 --> 29:41.726
You can check with Tommy Doyle.

29:41.893 --> 29:44.282
He's an oiler on the same crew.
He was late too.

29:44.453 --> 29:47.923
All right, maybe we'll talk to him.

29:48.333 --> 29:50.722
Paddy, we've been talking to Paula.

29:51.093 --> 29:53.323
-Paula Anderson?
SlPOWlCZ: Yeah.

29:53.493 --> 29:54.812
ls she in trouble?

29:55.493 --> 29:59.486
A guy named Raymond Martarano
was shot in front of her place.

29:59.693 --> 30:01.809
-But she's okay?
-Yeah, she's okay.

30:01.973 --> 30:05.124
She ever talk to you about this guy,
Raymond Martarano?

30:05.293 --> 30:09.206
No. l don't see too much of her anymore
since she moved away from Elizabeth.

30:10.013 --> 30:13.403
She gave us the impression that the two
of you were pretty close at one time.

30:13.573 --> 30:16.531
Yeah? Well, we were.

30:16.693 --> 30:19.924
Did you know she was going out
with Raymond for the last three months?

30:20.213 --> 30:22.329
No, l didn't know that.

30:22.733 --> 30:26.089
l don't know too much about what she
does since she moved to the city.

30:26.293 --> 30:31.925
Yeah. This Martarano's a mob guy.
A real scumbag.

30:32.093 --> 30:33.572
l guess they caught up with him.

30:33.733 --> 30:37.851
An elderly woman lives in one of the
apartments, was sitting at her window. . .

30:38.013 --> 30:40.925
. . .she got hit by a stray bullet.

30:41.653 --> 30:43.723
-She gonna be all right?
-She's dead.

30:43.893 --> 30:46.009
SlMONE: l'm sure no one meant
to kill that woman.

30:46.173 --> 30:48.846
But until we find out
why the guy was killed. . .

30:49.013 --> 30:51.846
. . .we got to treat that one
as an intentional murder also.

30:52.013 --> 30:54.129
SlPOWlCZ:
But we know it wasn't.

30:55.373 --> 30:57.887
Yeah, well, l didn't shoot anybody.

30:58.693 --> 31:02.322
SlPOWlCZ: All right, Paddy, we got
to check out a few things.

31:02.493 --> 31:06.805
Why don't you take the time,
think if there's any way you can help us.

31:07.373 --> 31:08.692
Huh?

31:21.453 --> 31:23.808
l'm sure someone transposed
license plate numbers.

31:23.973 --> 31:26.851
l've never had an auto accident,
and l've never been in Albany.

31:27.013 --> 31:28.810
There may be some clerical mix-up.

31:28.973 --> 31:31.441
l don't know why we couldn't have
done this by phone.

31:31.613 --> 31:34.844
COSTAS: Well, they need a personal
interview for the files.

31:35.213 --> 31:37.010
Step right in.

31:49.013 --> 31:51.573
To tell you the truth, Mr. Davis. . .

31:51.733 --> 31:55.009
. . .we're not going to be talking
about any auto accident in Albany.

31:55.173 --> 31:56.492
What do you mean?

31:56.653 --> 32:00.612
-You know what we'll be talking about.
-l have absolutely no idea.

32:00.773 --> 32:03.128
You saying you brought me here
under false pretenses?

32:03.293 --> 32:04.282
COSTAS:

from your wife and daughter.

32:16.493 --> 32:18.404
They've made some
disturbing statements.

32:18.973 --> 32:21.282
l'm dumbfounded by this.

32:21.773 --> 32:23.889
A lot of people have

says you've done.

32:26.533 --> 32:27.648

32:27.813 --> 32:32.443
They tend to focus on punishment,
which in your case, would be prison.

32:32.613 --> 32:34.808
-Prison?
-That's right.

32:35.733 --> 32:37.724

Then it goes to the DA,
it's out of my hands.

33:05.173 --> 33:07.687
What would be the alternative?

33:08.053 --> 33:10.487
Something like counseling?

33:10.893 --> 33:14.124
Well, l'd need your help
on something like that.

33:14.293 --> 33:16.807
You'd have to make a statement

SlPOWlCZ:
Paddy, l know you're a decent guy.

34:59.893 --> 35:03.932
You want to do the right thing and
help these people that lost their mother.

35:04.093 --> 35:06.448
You got to know
what they're going through.

35:06.773 --> 35:09.810
You ready to do the right thing, Paddy?

35:09.973 --> 35:13.602
Look, Paula and me, we've been
together since we were 1 1 years old.

35:13.973 --> 35:15.770
l love her.

35:17.053 --> 35:19.886
Guys used to make fun of me
because l love her so much.

35:20.253 --> 35:22.926
l got money saved. l was gonna
get us a place in Rahway.

35:23.093 --> 35:25.004
How'd you find out
she was seeing Raymond?

35:25.173 --> 35:27.403
PADD Y:
Guy from over in Elizabeth.

35:27.613 --> 35:29.808
He's an electrician.
He was working 7th Avenue.

35:30.333 --> 35:32.801
He saw them. He told me about it.

35:32.973 --> 35:34.804
l didn't want to believe him.

35:34.973 --> 35:37.328
l had to see for myself.

35:38.453 --> 35:42.128
l got money saved. l was gonna buy us
a place with a nice yard in Rahway.

35:42.293 --> 35:46.923
So, what'd you do? You waited in front
of her place, and you saw him come out?

35:47.093 --> 35:49.732
Yeah, he came out. Yeah.

35:49.893 --> 35:50.962
Did he see you?

35:51.253 --> 35:54.733
-Did he threaten you or anything?
-No.

35:54.733 --> 35:55.006
-Did he threaten you or anything?
-No.

35:55.493 --> 35:57.404
lt was just the way he walked,
that prick.

35:57.973 --> 36:01.090
Like he had just taken away my life
and he felt good about it.

36:01.573 --> 36:04.610
So he sees me,
l tell him l want to talk to him.

36:05.293 --> 36:07.682
He tells me to kiss his ass.

36:07.853 --> 36:11.641
So l tell him he should leave her alone
because he probably doesn't love her.

36:11.813 --> 36:13.485
Then he sees l got a gun.

36:13.653 --> 36:17.168
-Did you have the gun out?
-No, it was just in my belt.

36:17.333 --> 36:19.244
Then he goes for me
and raises up his hand.

36:19.533 --> 36:22.172
-So you guys struggled, huh?
PADD Y: Not really.

36:22.893 --> 36:26.966
He made, like, these little burping
noises every time the bullets hit him.

36:32.813 --> 36:35.247
l'm sorry about that lady.

36:39.013 --> 36:42.972
Take a little break, huh?
Then we'll go talk to the DA.

37:20.653 --> 37:22.723

l'd get off with counseling.

38:00.053 --> 38:03.568
Someone else will make that decision.
l'm putting you under arrest.

38:04.013 --> 38:05.332
You lied to me!

38:05.493 --> 38:08.053
You promised if l made a statement,
l wouldn't go to jail.

38:08.213 --> 38:12.206
l said a statement's your best shot.
The DA makes the decision.

38:12.853 --> 38:14.809
You want my opinion?

38:14.973 --> 38:18.761
l hope they put you away,

38:21.173 --> 38:22.891
Will she have to make
another statement?

38:23.053 --> 38:25.965
No, that will be it for today.
The DA will be in touch with you.

That's just something l could never do.

39:29.293 --> 39:31.284
You know that.

39:32.653 --> 39:34.723
Don't you know that?

39:36.293 --> 39:39.842
Sure, you got to know that. Huh?

39:40.933 --> 39:43.572
You got to know that.

39:48.253 --> 39:49.447
So l'll see you later?

39:49.613 --> 39:53.162
Yeah, l'll see you at Georgetti's.
He wants to buy us a beer.

39:53.333 --> 39:56.882
He seems like a nice guy.
You wanna invite him to dinner?

39:57.053 --> 40:00.966
Hey, l'm working with this guy.
l'm not looking to adopt him.

40:01.133 --> 40:02.691
-See you.
-Yeah.

40:03.293 --> 40:05.523
-Andy's in the hall.
SlMONE: All right, let's go.

40:05.693 --> 40:08.332
-Hey, good job today.
SlMONE: Thanks, lieutenant.

40:08.493 --> 40:10.245
Lucky l gave you the full orientation.

40:10.413 --> 40:13.564
-lt's always this quiet around here, huh?
FANCY: Good night, guys.

40:14.813 --> 40:17.088
-Are you ready?
MARTlNEZ: Yeah, l'm ready.

40:23.493 --> 40:24.721
SlMONE:
And a soda.

40:25.613 --> 40:27.843
-Thanks, Bobby.
MARTlNEZ: Yeah, thanks a lot.

40:28.013 --> 40:30.732
Thanks for making me
feel welcome, guys.

40:32.253 --> 40:33.766
SlPOWlCZ:
So. . .

40:34.333 --> 40:37.052
-. . .he raises pigeons.
-ls that right?

40:37.213 --> 40:40.285
Racing homers.
Flown them since l was a kid.

40:40.453 --> 40:42.921
Yeah, what's the actual limit there?

40:43.093 --> 40:45.448
The farthest they can
actually return from?

40:45.613 --> 40:47.410
l've had them come back
from 500 miles.

40:47.653 --> 40:51.202
-You must be some kind of trainer, huh?
SlMONE: lt isn't training.

40:51.373 --> 40:53.284
lt's what's inside them.

40:53.493 --> 40:56.690
l had these 1 0 birds, and l took them
up to Maine with me, right?

40:56.853 --> 40:59.925
An hour after l get back home,
l'm standing there on the roof. . .

41:00.093 --> 41:03.449
. . .and l'm watching them come in.
Every single one of them made it back.

41:03.613 --> 41:05.922
l raise fish.

41:06.093 --> 41:07.208
ls that right?

41:07.373 --> 41:09.329
Oh, yeah.
That's a big hobby with Andy.

41:09.493 --> 41:11.609
Saltwater tropicals.

41:11.773 --> 41:14.241
MARTlNEZ:
See, there's a hobby l never understood.

41:14.413 --> 41:16.005
l had buddies that raised pigeons--

41:16.173 --> 41:19.643
l got a clown fish couple.
They just had eggs.

41:20.053 --> 41:22.693
The morning, when l'm having
my coffee, the male. . .

41:22.693 --> 41:23.603
The morning, when l'm having
my coffee, the male. . .

41:23.773 --> 41:26.367
. . .he cleans each egg with his mouth.

41:26.533 --> 41:28.171
Never breaks one.

41:28.333 --> 41:32.690
Then the whole day while l'm working,
him and the wife are guarding that nest.

41:32.853 --> 41:35.413
They fan the water all over their eggs.

41:35.853 --> 41:38.287
Those are dedicated fish.

41:39.173 --> 41:41.971
You seen that kind of thing in pigeons?

41:42.133 --> 41:45.967
-Pigeons make good parents.
-Anyways, l gotta go.

41:46.133 --> 41:48.283
Yeah, l gotta go too.

41:48.493 --> 41:50.688
-Thanks for the beer, Bobby.
MEDAVO Y: Yeah, me too.

41:50.853 --> 41:53.048
-l'll see you tomorrow, huh?
-l'll see you guys.

41:53.253 --> 41:55.892
MEDAVO Y: Yeah.
-Take it easy.

41:56.373 --> 41:59.206
MEDAVO Y: Good night, Dave.
DAVE: Have a good night, guys.

42:03.653 --> 42:06.372
Feels good being back out
in the street, Andy.

42:08.413 --> 42:09.971
Forgot how much l missed it.

42:11.453 --> 42:15.605
So you took that p.c. job for what?

42:15.773 --> 42:17.001
A fast career track?

42:17.533 --> 42:20.093
l needed something with regular hours.

42:20.293 --> 42:22.807
l had some problems at home.

42:26.573 --> 42:28.962
My wife had breast cancer.

42:29.893 --> 42:31.485
She died last year.

42:34.733 --> 42:36.803
That had to be tough.

42:37.373 --> 42:39.091
l'm sorry.

42:41.413 --> 42:45.372
Look, l'm meeting a friend
for dinner. Wanna join us?

42:46.293 --> 42:47.965
Thanks, Andy, no.
You know what?

42:48.133 --> 42:50.249
l'm gonna go back
and do the fives on the case.

42:50.413 --> 42:52.973
Don't let me discourage you there.

42:57.133 --> 42:59.727
-So l'll see you tomorrow, huh?
-Yeah.

43:43.533 --> 43:46.206
l figured maybe l'd do
my own paperwork.

43:49.453 --> 43:51.011
Sure.

43:52.333 --> 43:56.690
This is some Greek stuff
from one of those Greek places.

43:57.813 --> 44:00.771
-You know, those grape leaf rolls.
-Dolma.

44:01.373 --> 44:03.967
Sylvia stopped for it,
the ADA you met.

44:04.133 --> 44:05.122
Thanks.

44:06.293 --> 44:08.443
Yeah, it was her idea.

44:15.093 --> 44:17.812
So l got about halfway
through the interviews.

44:17.973 --> 44:22.444
Let's just divvy up
what you got left there.

44:39.293 --> 44:41.523
l got to wear glasses now.

44:43.573 --> 44:45.643
lt's all that paperwork, man.

44:45.813 --> 44:47.610
Yeah, l just need them for reading.
