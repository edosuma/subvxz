WEBVTT

00:02.600 --> 00:03.828
<i>My name is Barry Allen,</i>

00:03.920 --> 00:05.434
<i>and I am
the fastest man alive.</i>

00:06.200 --> 00:07.200
<i>To the outside world,</i>

00:07.280 --> 00:09.192
<i>I'm an ordinary
forensic scientist.</i>

00:09.320 --> 00:10.595
<i>But secretly, with the help</i>

00:10.680 --> 00:12.319
<i>of my friends
at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

00:12.400 --> 00:13.960
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans</i>

00:14.000 --> 00:15.150
<i>like me.</i>

00:15.240 --> 00:17.136
<i>But when my daughter came back
from the future to help,</i>

00:17.160 --> 00:19.880
<i>she changed the present</i>

00:19.960 --> 00:22.475
<i>and now our world is
more dangerous than ever.</i>

00:22.560 --> 00:24.870
<i>And I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.</i>

00:25.000 --> 00:27.435
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

00:28.360 --> 00:29.536
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:29.560 --> 00:31.597
<i>Meet Joss Jackam.</i>

00:31.680 --> 00:34.195
<i>She's a delinquent teen
turned amateur storm chaser.</i>

00:34.280 --> 00:36.556
<i>That weathervane,
doesn't it look a lot like...</i>

00:36.680 --> 00:38.240
<i>The staff
she was carrying, yeah.</i>

00:38.280 --> 00:41.159
<i>It's infected
with a satellite shard.</i>

00:41.240 --> 00:43.311
Our satellite didn't
just create new metas.

00:43.400 --> 00:44.400
It created meta-tech.

00:46.040 --> 00:47.872
Every time you vibe
or breach,

00:47.960 --> 00:49.256
the dark matter
is going to affect

00:49.280 --> 00:50.656
your central nervous system,
causing you

00:50.680 --> 00:52.034
<i>more and more pain.</i>

00:52.120 --> 00:53.918
- We need to talk.
<i>- Yes, Nora.</i>

00:54.000 --> 00:55.514
Yes, we do.

00:59.240 --> 01:02.631
You've been gone
a long time, Nora.

01:02.720 --> 01:04.518
You're lucky
I came back at all.

01:04.599 --> 01:05.600
Really?

01:10.960 --> 01:12.872
I can tell you have questions.

01:14.480 --> 01:15.834
Ask them.

01:15.920 --> 01:17.957
- You killed my grandmother?
- I did.

01:18.040 --> 01:19.554
- In front of my father?
- I did.

01:19.680 --> 01:20.680
- He was a boy.
- Nora...

01:20.760 --> 01:23.036
He was just a kid!

01:23.120 --> 01:24.315
You're right,

01:24.400 --> 01:28.076
and I think of
that moment every day,

01:28.160 --> 01:30.595
how it changed
the course of destiny

01:30.680 --> 01:31.955
for him,

01:32.040 --> 01:33.554
<i>for you,</i>

01:33.640 --> 01:34.915
for me.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.799
I never knew he had that kind
of hatred inside of him,

01:37.880 --> 01:40.349
but he does because of you.

01:40.440 --> 01:43.558
And I have that same hatred
inside of me for him!

01:45.680 --> 01:47.478
Or at least I did.

01:47.560 --> 01:50.951
I was inspired by him,
as you are.

01:51.040 --> 01:53.635
I wanted to know him,
as you do.

01:53.720 --> 01:57.191
I wanted to be him.
I wanted to be the Flash.

01:57.280 --> 01:59.920
You will never be the Flash.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.150
Exactly!

02:02.840 --> 02:05.719
And that realization
is what broke me.

02:07.320 --> 02:09.232
<i>That's the realization
that led me to do</i>

02:09.320 --> 02:10.720
<i>the things that I did.</i>

02:10.800 --> 02:13.918
The terrible, horrible,

02:14.000 --> 02:17.311
evil things I did.

02:17.400 --> 02:20.154
I've been coming here
for so long.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.959
Why didn't you tell me
what you did?

02:22.040 --> 02:23.520
I thought you must know.

02:23.600 --> 02:25.159
Your mother would've told you.

02:26.520 --> 02:28.352
I was wrong. I see that.

02:28.440 --> 02:31.751
I'm sorry, Nora.

02:31.880 --> 02:33.712
I don't trust you anymore.

02:33.840 --> 02:35.957
Have I not
given you everything?

02:36.440 --> 02:39.114
<i>The chance to go back and know
a father you never knew?</i>

02:39.200 --> 02:41.396
<i>To learn from him?
To run with him?</i>

02:41.480 --> 02:43.278
To run with the Flash.

02:43.360 --> 02:47.149
I showed you how
to time travel because...

02:48.080 --> 02:49.833
I want to help you.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.435
No, the only person that you
ever help is yourself.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.079
Who told you that?

02:54.160 --> 02:55.480
Your father?

03:01.240 --> 03:03.471
For as long as I can remember,

03:03.560 --> 03:05.791
<i>all I ever thought about
was myself,</i>

03:05.880 --> 03:07.439
and that will not
be my legacy.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.591
That will not the legacy
of Eobard Thawne!

03:09.680 --> 03:10.680
Let me help you!

03:13.000 --> 03:15.595
I don't want your help.

03:15.680 --> 03:16.830
Not anymore.

03:33.560 --> 03:35.756
<i>So we've got some good
news and some bad news.</i>

03:35.840 --> 03:38.036
The good news is that CCPD
is still stationed outside

03:38.120 --> 03:40.999
of Grace's room and will remain
so until Dwyer's been caught.

03:41.080 --> 03:42.799
But the bad news is,
that means Dwyer won't

03:42.880 --> 03:44.216
be visiting her again
anytime soon.

03:44.240 --> 03:45.616
<i>And then the worst news is,</i>

03:45.640 --> 03:47.552
we have no idea where Cicada
could be hiding.

03:47.640 --> 03:50.599
Can't we just track him by
the dark energy in his dagger?

03:50.680 --> 03:53.240
Well, we can, but only
when he uses it, which,

03:53.320 --> 03:55.391
thank God,
hasn't been recently.

03:55.480 --> 03:57.096
And he's not showing up
on facial recognition?

03:57.120 --> 03:59.635
Unless he decides to make
an appearance, we've got zilch.

03:59.720 --> 04:01.680
Which reminds me, where
the rest of Team Flash is?

04:01.760 --> 04:03.717
Where's baby giraffe
and young Nora?

04:03.800 --> 04:05.776
Ralph's visiting his mom.
He said to call if we need him.

04:05.800 --> 04:08.269
- And Nora is...
- Right here.

04:08.360 --> 04:10.256
I just stopped by the loft
to pick up your blue suit.

04:10.280 --> 04:11.999
I figured you'd had enough
of green.

04:12.080 --> 04:13.576
Hey, I made that green suit
work, though.

04:14.680 --> 04:16.160
What is, uh,
that for again?

04:16.240 --> 04:18.152
Mama Cecile's first day
back to the courtroom

04:18.240 --> 04:20.152
and Dad's testimony
against Weather Witch.

04:20.279 --> 04:21.839
Joss Jackam's trial
is later today.

04:21.920 --> 04:23.559
It starts in 30 minutes.

04:23.640 --> 04:26.314
Well, since my dad is with
Jenna visiting Wally,

04:26.400 --> 04:28.596
why don't I come with you guys
and help support Cecile?

04:28.680 --> 04:30.558
Yeah. When are they
coming back, by the way?

04:30.640 --> 04:32.376
- They've been gone forever.
- Uh, he's not sure.

04:32.400 --> 04:34.596
After having a psychopath
break into his home,

04:34.680 --> 04:35.880
I don't think he's in any rush

04:35.920 --> 04:37.416
to bring a newborn back
to Central City.

04:37.440 --> 04:38.856
Besides, Cecile has a lot
on her plate

04:38.880 --> 04:40.536
with this being
her first day back at work.

04:40.560 --> 04:41.776
I can't wait to see
Weather Witch

04:41.800 --> 04:42.800
get what she deserves.

04:46.680 --> 04:49.149
Hey, you ready to get those
shards out of your hands?

04:49.240 --> 04:50.276
Hell yes!

04:50.360 --> 04:52.829
I haven't been able to play
PS4 properly for weeks.

04:52.920 --> 04:54.639
See you in there.

04:56.560 --> 04:57.560
Hey, you feel that?

04:57.640 --> 04:58.756
Feel what?

04:58.840 --> 05:00.797
That's the feeling
of free time.

05:00.880 --> 05:02.951
AKA unbillable hours,

05:03.040 --> 05:04.896
so we better not be seeing
any invoices from you

05:04.920 --> 05:05.990
in the near future.

05:06.080 --> 05:07.080
<i>Oh, that's all right.</i>

05:08.600 --> 05:11.195
This is one mystery
I will solve for free.

05:31.640 --> 05:34.519
<i>The state versus
Joslyn Jackam,</i>

05:34.600 --> 05:39.516
Criminal Court of Central City,
meta-crime number 99512.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.717
Welcome back to my courtroom,
Miss Horton.

05:41.800 --> 05:45.157
I trust your maternity leave
was enjoyable?

05:45.280 --> 05:46.600
Thank you, Your Honor.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.275
I am very happy
to be back at work.

05:49.360 --> 05:51.272
<i>Yeah, there never really is
enough time</i>

05:51.360 --> 05:53.397
with a newborn, is there?

05:53.480 --> 05:56.040
There is not.
You may proceed.

05:56.120 --> 05:57.679
Thank you, Your Honor.

05:59.200 --> 06:00.634
The prosecution
intends to prove

06:00.720 --> 06:02.439
that between November 20th
and 27th,

06:02.520 --> 06:05.160
Joslyn Jackam
used this device,

06:05.240 --> 06:06.515
<i>a so-called piece of meta-tech,</i>

06:06.600 --> 06:09.274
to unlawfully and intentionally

06:09.360 --> 06:11.238
harm the citizens
of Central City.

06:11.320 --> 06:12.674
<i>Her meta-crimes include</i>

06:12.760 --> 06:14.911
<i>massive property damage
at Iron Heights,</i>

06:15.000 --> 06:16.957
<i>the grounding
of 21 separate flights</i>

06:17.040 --> 06:18.156
<i>at Sheldon County Airport,</i>

06:18.240 --> 06:20.277
<i>and the attempted murder</i>

06:20.400 --> 06:23.916
of her own father,
Mark Mardon.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.310
Now, this attack
on her father was...

06:30.600 --> 06:32.637
Uh...

06:32.720 --> 06:35.189
Uh, the...

06:35.280 --> 06:37.715
the attack on her father
was premeditated.

06:37.800 --> 06:40.952
Um, and...

06:41.040 --> 06:43.555
the prosecution
is seeking the...

06:48.480 --> 06:50.597
Are you okay?

06:50.720 --> 06:52.677
Uh...

06:53.480 --> 06:55.597
yeah, it's just a...

06:55.680 --> 06:57.114
feeling.

06:58.720 --> 06:59.949
I'll be fine.

07:05.680 --> 07:08.559
The prosecution is seeking the
maximum sentence, Your Honor.

07:14.680 --> 07:16.160
<i>Gotcha.</i>

07:17.080 --> 07:18.309
All right, almost done.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.631
Micro-scale surgery
is not the easiest.

07:20.720 --> 07:22.376
Is that why you missed these
the first time?

07:22.400 --> 07:23.400
Hey, now!

07:24.600 --> 07:26.114
All right, there you go.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.510
Your hands are officially
dagger shard free.

07:28.600 --> 07:29.600
Hallelu.

07:29.680 --> 07:30.716
One more thing.

07:40.680 --> 07:43.195
Mm, meta-sutures
for meta-wounds,

07:43.280 --> 07:44.555
that's clever.

07:44.640 --> 07:47.235
Ah! Note to self,
ice healing actually hurts.

07:47.360 --> 07:48.760
Don't be a wuss.

07:49.560 --> 07:52.712
Wuss.
You're the wuss.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.632
Looks like you've got
this whole

07:54.720 --> 07:56.279
Caitlyn/Killer Frost thing
down pat.

07:56.360 --> 07:57.999
- Eh, not totally.
- I got it.

07:58.120 --> 08:00.351
But it is getting easier
to switch to Killer Frost

08:00.440 --> 08:02.193
when I need to.

08:02.280 --> 08:04.840
So those sutures should stay
frozen while the wound heals.

08:04.960 --> 08:07.759
Once they melt, you can
take the bandages off.

08:07.880 --> 08:08.880
You'll be good to go.

08:08.960 --> 08:10.997
I have to confess.

08:11.080 --> 08:14.710
I've actually really enjoyed
not having my powers lately.

08:15.240 --> 08:16.993
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:17.080 --> 08:20.357
I got used to being Cisco again
sans Vibe-age, you know?

08:20.440 --> 08:23.194
And not having villains
breathing down my neck

08:23.280 --> 08:25.749
once a week, I have to say,
is pretty schway.

08:25.840 --> 08:27.399
Well, if we're gonna
defeat Cicada,

08:27.480 --> 08:29.119
we need
a fully functioning Vibe.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.510
So hopefully
this does the trick.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.273
Here, souvenirs.

08:33.360 --> 08:35.955
- Oh, thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

08:41.240 --> 08:42.640
<i>Opening statements
are underway</i>

08:42.679 --> 08:44.478
<i>in the trial of Joss Jackam,</i>

08:44.560 --> 08:47.359
<i>otherwise known
as Weather Witch.</i>

08:52.240 --> 08:53.390
Just saying,
nothing wrong

08:53.480 --> 08:55.233
with three or four
martinis at lunch.

08:55.320 --> 08:57.357
It is when you get in
your Lamborghini and drive.

08:57.440 --> 08:59.636
Sir, sir, focus here.

08:59.720 --> 09:03.031
<i>Touch your nose.</i>

09:08.840 --> 09:10.957
Hey! That's my car!

09:14.320 --> 09:15.736
And then what happened,
Miss Pellett?

09:15.760 --> 09:19.754
She created some kind
of lightning tornado.

09:19.840 --> 09:21.911
<i>I wasn't sure if any of us
were gonna make it.</i>

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
I got to go.

09:27.080 --> 09:29.436
One moment, please.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.272
I got to go.
There's been a car theft.

09:33.360 --> 09:35.256
What are you talking about?
You're my lead CSI witness.

09:35.280 --> 09:36.760
You're on the stand
in 30 minutes.

09:36.840 --> 09:38.957
I'm sorry.
It's a Lamborghini, all right?

09:39.040 --> 09:41.016
The cops aren't gonna be able
to keep up with this thing.

09:41.040 --> 09:42.216
- It'll be quick.
- 30 minutes.

09:42.240 --> 09:43.799
- All right.
<i>- Miss Horton?</i>

09:49.640 --> 09:51.199
Hmm, where were we?

10:16.440 --> 10:18.432
Guys, the car just turned
north on 8th,

10:18.520 --> 10:20.716
- headed towards Wakefield.
<i>- Got it.</i>

10:20.800 --> 10:22.439
Get ready to take
control of the wheel.

10:22.520 --> 10:24.716
- What are you gonna do?
- Get the driver.

10:26.240 --> 10:27.356
Here we go.

10:50.240 --> 10:51.240
Dad!

10:52.880 --> 10:55.190
- What's happening?
- I can't stop vibrating.

11:00.840 --> 11:02.069
Guys! We need your help!
Guys!

11:02.160 --> 11:05.949
- With what?
- With...

11:06.040 --> 11:07.110
With that?

11:07.880 --> 11:09.075
I can't stop phasing.

11:09.160 --> 11:10.616
And I can't counter-phase him
forever.

11:10.640 --> 11:11.835
Okay, that's not good.

11:11.920 --> 11:13.718
If you keep going
but you don't,

11:13.800 --> 11:14.870
then you could...

11:14.960 --> 11:16.235
fall to your death.

11:16.360 --> 11:18.670
- Yeah!
- What are we gonna do?

11:18.760 --> 11:20.080
- Let him.
- Uh...

11:20.160 --> 11:21.753
What?

11:21.840 --> 11:23.274
Yes, if you phase
through the floor,

11:23.360 --> 11:24.376
you're actually gonna fall
into pipeline cell

11:24.400 --> 11:25.629
directly below us.

11:25.720 --> 11:27.136
And the dampening unit
will negate your powers.

11:27.160 --> 11:28.389
Unless we don't
time it right.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.632
In which case, your torso would
be severed from your legs

11:31.720 --> 11:32.949
<i>as you enter the cell.</i>

11:33.040 --> 11:34.235
- Not helping.
- Stop, stop.

11:34.320 --> 11:36.835
Okay, stop.
I tr... I trust you Cisco.

11:36.920 --> 11:38.354
Move to the right.

11:38.440 --> 11:39.635
No, my right.

11:39.760 --> 11:41.399
Cisco! Come on!

11:41.480 --> 11:43.312
Okay, stop right there!

11:43.400 --> 11:45.039
One step back.
Cisco!

11:45.120 --> 11:46.456
Actually, never mind,
one step forward.

11:46.480 --> 11:50.110
Okay, ready?
Three, two, one, go!

12:07.880 --> 12:09.080
<i>What's going on with me?</i>

12:09.120 --> 12:10.440
<i>So...</i>

12:10.520 --> 12:12.079
the car you touched

12:12.160 --> 12:15.153
was saturated with
unstable dark matter.

12:15.240 --> 12:16.576
And because you were phasing
at the time,

12:16.600 --> 12:18.193
it caused your body
to destabilize

12:18.280 --> 12:19.475
on a cellular level.

12:19.560 --> 12:20.760
<i>When I got close
to the driver,</i>

12:20.840 --> 12:22.240
<i>I saw dark matter veins
flare up,</i>

12:22.320 --> 12:24.096
<i>just like on the back
of Spencer Young's phone.</i>

12:24.120 --> 12:26.077
So the car is a piece
of meta-tech?

12:26.160 --> 12:27.879
That or whatever was
controlling it.

12:27.960 --> 12:29.736
How long is he gonna
have to stay in there for?

12:29.760 --> 12:31.096
Without the help
of the power dampeners,

12:31.120 --> 12:33.351
it could take up to a day?

12:33.480 --> 12:35.416
<i>No, no, no, no! I-I have to
present evidence on the stand</i>

12:35.440 --> 12:36.510
<i>in, like, ten minutes.</i>

12:36.600 --> 12:37.670
<i>Cecile's gonna kill me.</i>

12:37.760 --> 12:39.717
- That's not good.
- Um...

12:41.000 --> 12:42.354
I could do it.

12:45.200 --> 12:46.520
<i>You can't be serious.</i>

12:46.600 --> 12:47.920
Well, when Dad
made me official,

12:48.000 --> 12:49.456
he submitted my paperwork
to the court,

12:49.480 --> 12:51.676
so I'm qualified to present
forensic evidence.

12:51.760 --> 12:52.989
I can do this.

12:54.560 --> 12:57.598
I cannot believe this is
happening on my first day back.

12:57.680 --> 12:59.512
It's my first day back.
Okay.

12:59.600 --> 13:02.035
Go to the court reporter.
Check in.

13:02.120 --> 13:05.557
Tell her that Barry
was in a traffic accident.

13:05.640 --> 13:06.915
Yes.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.356
And, Nora, when you're
up there on the stand,

13:09.440 --> 13:10.794
you just follow my lead.

13:10.880 --> 13:12.712
- Got it?
- Mm-hmm.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.239
Don't worry.
Nora can handle this.

13:15.320 --> 13:16.320
<i>It's not that.</i>

13:16.440 --> 13:18.796
I've decided I'm gonna pursue
a lighter sentence.

13:18.880 --> 13:20.439
Why the change of heart?

13:20.520 --> 13:23.160
Because I keep feeling these

13:23.280 --> 13:27.274
waves of remorse
coming off of Joss.

13:27.360 --> 13:29.317
I think she just wants
to start over

13:29.400 --> 13:30.960
so she doesn't turn out
like her father.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.638
So, Miss West,
can you explain what effect

13:35.720 --> 13:38.554
these conditions had on
the Sheldon County Airport?

13:38.640 --> 13:40.199
The facility was hit by winds

13:40.280 --> 13:43.557
<i>ranging from
150 to 250 miles per hour.</i>

13:43.640 --> 13:46.792
Wow, that's...
that is pretty dangerous.

13:46.880 --> 13:52.239
And yet not a single person
was injured.

13:52.320 --> 13:54.232
Well, no,
but that was because...

13:54.320 --> 13:56.160
What about these
lightning marks on the tarmac?

13:56.200 --> 13:58.476
Would you say that
that is common,

13:58.560 --> 14:00.233
given the nature of the weather

14:00.320 --> 14:01.720
during the incident
in question?

14:01.800 --> 14:03.951
Yes, but luckily,
in this case,

14:04.040 --> 14:05.394
the lightning only hit
the runway

14:05.480 --> 14:06.816
and not
the surrounding structures.

14:06.840 --> 14:09.912
The structures where all
of the passengers were.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.471
I would say
that is pretty lucky indeed.

14:14.680 --> 14:16.876
Your Honor,
the prosecution rests.

14:17.840 --> 14:19.991
So that's it? You're not
gonna ask me anything else?

14:24.400 --> 14:26.357
Well, it would appear so.

14:28.080 --> 14:30.276
Mr. Lee, I think you're up.

14:35.680 --> 14:38.991
Miss West,
is my client a meta-human?

14:39.080 --> 14:41.675
No, but she used meta-tech.

14:41.760 --> 14:43.080
Specifically a weather staff

14:43.160 --> 14:45.959
that was corrupted
by dark matter.

14:46.040 --> 14:50.080
So one could say it was
the staff, not my client,

14:50.200 --> 14:52.396
that attacked the Sheldon
County Airport that night?

14:52.480 --> 14:56.269
No, one couldn't.
She used that staff.

14:56.360 --> 14:58.511
But isn't this just
an ordinary weather staff

14:58.600 --> 14:59.795
corrupted by dark matter?

14:59.880 --> 15:01.837
These are your words.

15:01.960 --> 15:03.553
- Yes, but...
- And since dark matter

15:03.640 --> 15:05.040
was able to corrupt a tool

15:05.120 --> 15:07.032
and turn it into a weapon
of destruction,

15:07.120 --> 15:09.510
isn't it also possible it could
corrupt the defendant?

15:09.600 --> 15:12.513
<i>No. Dark matter doesn't
make you do things.</i>

15:12.640 --> 15:15.599
She pointed lightning at a
hangar full of scared families.

15:15.680 --> 15:18.752
Your Honor, there were
little kids in that hangar.

15:18.840 --> 15:21.016
Did you know that... that
lightning is five times hotter

15:21.040 --> 15:22.679
<i>than the surface
of the sun?</i>

15:22.760 --> 15:25.673
That is the kind of power
that the defendant unleashed

15:25.760 --> 15:27.080
upon those people.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.356
She did this.

15:29.440 --> 15:31.955
This was her choice,
and she can't be trusted.

15:32.040 --> 15:33.918
No, Miss West,
you must sit down.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.256
I know, but, Your Honor...

15:35.280 --> 15:37.397
<i>- Sit down!</i>
- No! She's right.

15:37.480 --> 15:39.278
I'm guilty,

15:39.360 --> 15:41.352
and I should pay
for what I did.

15:48.440 --> 15:50.591
- What you doing?
- Get a load of this.

15:50.680 --> 15:52.000
You know those shards
you removed?

15:52.040 --> 15:53.679
I ran a biochemical analysis
on them

15:53.760 --> 15:54.880
and the tissue
from my hands.

15:54.960 --> 15:56.030
You know how to do that?

15:56.120 --> 15:58.794
I picked up a thing or two
from Caitlin Snow MD

15:58.880 --> 16:02.556
over the years,
and I found this.

16:04.200 --> 16:06.112
That's my tissue
right after I got sliced.

16:06.200 --> 16:08.032
Mm-hmm.

16:08.120 --> 16:09.713
That's from today.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.871
Almost all the dark matter
is gone.

16:11.960 --> 16:13.838
The shards weren't dampening
my powers.

16:13.920 --> 16:15.434
They were removing them.

16:15.520 --> 16:17.751
So the dagger has
anti-dark matter properties.

16:17.840 --> 16:19.194
Yes!

16:19.280 --> 16:21.016
Cisco, if we could synthesize
that into a serum,

16:21.040 --> 16:23.316
we could get rid
of Cicada's powers entirely.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.676
And not just his powers,
everyone's.

16:25.760 --> 16:28.070
- Everyone's?
- Caitlyn,

16:28.160 --> 16:30.550
we could make
a meta-human cure.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.390
You think we need
a meta-human cure?

16:34.480 --> 16:35.755
Don't you?

16:35.840 --> 16:37.240
Um...

16:38.000 --> 16:39.354
Okay, maybe not.

16:39.440 --> 16:42.274
But I seem to remember
a time when you did?

16:42.360 --> 16:44.511
Sure, when I first discovered
Killer Frost,

16:44.600 --> 16:46.114
I wanted to get rid of her.

16:46.200 --> 16:50.479
But when she was gone, it felt
like a piece of me was missing.

16:50.560 --> 16:53.359
Besides, we have seen
meta-human powers

16:53.440 --> 16:55.318
do really good things.

16:55.400 --> 16:57.869
Okay, yeah! If you can
build an ice bridge

16:57.960 --> 16:59.599
to avoid rush hour traffic,

16:59.680 --> 17:02.798
but what if my existence
gives everyone around me

17:02.880 --> 17:05.792
radiation poisoning
like Fallout?

17:05.880 --> 17:08.759
Those metas, we created them
against their will.

17:08.880 --> 17:10.837
No, Thawne created
the particle accelerator

17:10.920 --> 17:12.354
and he sabotaged it.

17:12.440 --> 17:14.440
And who shattered the
satellite full of dark matter

17:14.480 --> 17:16.233
and created God knows
how many metas?

17:16.319 --> 17:17.470
We did that.

17:17.560 --> 17:21.473
This cure could give
meta-humans a second chance

17:21.599 --> 17:23.159
at having a normal life.

17:23.240 --> 17:25.993
Maybe not everyone wants
a normal life, Cisco.

17:52.080 --> 17:53.878
Look out!

18:05.640 --> 18:07.199
Who does this lady
think she is?

18:17.680 --> 18:18.680
What the hell?

18:35.120 --> 18:36.236
Who are you?

18:36.320 --> 18:38.755
Your ride.
Let's go.

18:43.480 --> 18:46.393
So Joss Jackam never made it
to Iron Heights.

18:46.520 --> 18:48.113
Nope, and
the transport driver said

18:48.200 --> 18:49.456
that the woman who took her
used something

18:49.480 --> 18:51.437
that completely
shut down his truck.

18:51.520 --> 18:52.715
Pause.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.996
<i>That. Look familiar?</i>

18:55.080 --> 18:56.753
Ugh, another piece
of satellite shard.

18:56.840 --> 18:58.593
So the fob is the meta-tech?

18:58.680 --> 19:00.696
Yeah, probably sends out
some kind of dark matter pulse

19:00.720 --> 19:02.757
that overrides any
guidance system in seconds.

19:02.840 --> 19:04.320
So as long as
she has an engine,

19:04.400 --> 19:05.754
she can control it
and we still

19:05.840 --> 19:07.320
don't even know
who we're looking for.

19:07.360 --> 19:10.034
Maybe we do.
Hey, can you fast-forward?

19:11.640 --> 19:13.199
<i>Stop.</i>

19:13.280 --> 19:16.159
Yeah, look, that salute.
She's definitely military.

19:16.240 --> 19:19.756
Okay, let's run that face
through the DOD database.

19:22.960 --> 19:24.519
<i>Raya Van Zandt.</i>

19:24.640 --> 19:27.360
Former Air Force,
ace pilot, mechanic,

19:27.440 --> 19:30.274
and expert
in vehicle operations.

19:30.360 --> 19:32.875
She was
dishonorably discharged.

19:32.960 --> 19:35.714
Call sign was Silver Ghost.
Huh?

19:35.800 --> 19:38.554
The rest of her
military record was sealed.

19:38.640 --> 19:40.736
Okay, well, I'm gonna see
if my dad can call in a favor

19:40.760 --> 19:41.816
and maybe we can get a copy.

19:41.840 --> 19:43.479
Yeah, and in the meantime,

19:43.560 --> 19:45.376
it looks like we have
two bad girls to track down.

19:45.400 --> 19:47.232
I'm not so sure, Nora.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.915
I mean, Cecile said that
she could feel Joss' remorse.

19:50.040 --> 19:52.032
Come on, Mom.
That was a show.

19:52.120 --> 19:54.510
I mean, do you think
this escape was a coincidence?

19:54.600 --> 19:56.239
Uh, well,
we don't know yet, Nora.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.320
<i>Yes, we do.</i>

19:57.400 --> 19:59.790
Raya got that fob to break Joss
out of the prison transport.

19:59.880 --> 20:01.633
I guarantee you Joss
is a part of this.

20:01.760 --> 20:02.760
How do you know that?

20:02.840 --> 20:04.752
Because bad people
don't change.

20:08.680 --> 20:09.875
<i>Hey, guys, any way</i>

20:09.960 --> 20:12.077
<i>you could send down
some food?</i>

20:14.960 --> 20:17.350
Welcome to home base.

20:17.440 --> 20:18.954
Home base of what?

20:19.040 --> 20:20.633
The Young Rogues.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.712
There's been enough
old men running this town.

20:22.800 --> 20:23.870
Our turn.

20:24.840 --> 20:26.399
I have my eyes
on a few candidates,

20:26.480 --> 20:29.279
but for this job, plan on it
just being you and me.

20:29.360 --> 20:32.000
Um,
I'm not planning anything!

20:32.080 --> 20:34.675
I don't even know who you are!
Just take me back!

20:37.000 --> 20:39.834
<i>You ever heard of A.R.G.U.S.?</i>

20:39.920 --> 20:43.277
It's an off-the-grid facility
primed with bleeding-edge tech,

20:43.360 --> 20:44.953
<i>and it's protected by one</i>

20:45.040 --> 20:48.192
<i>of the most advanced
security systems on Earth.</i>

20:49.040 --> 20:51.032
The only thing that can
short it out is

20:51.120 --> 20:53.316
a billion joules
of electricity.

20:55.120 --> 20:56.873
So a few bolts of lightning.

20:56.960 --> 20:59.429
You're the Weather Witch,
right?

20:59.520 --> 21:03.434
Beneath this wall is
the facility's power junction.

21:03.520 --> 21:07.036
You hit that and we have
a four-minute window

21:07.160 --> 21:10.790
to get something that
will make us unstoppable.

21:10.880 --> 21:13.554
No, look,
even if I was gonna help you,

21:13.640 --> 21:15.074
and I'm not,

21:15.160 --> 21:16.896
I need my weather staff
to control any of that,

21:16.920 --> 21:18.256
and right now,
that is in police holdup.

21:18.280 --> 21:20.636
So if you could
just take me back.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.198
Okay.

21:25.960 --> 21:27.394
<i>To do what?</i>

21:28.640 --> 21:30.279
Turn myself in.

21:30.360 --> 21:32.431
I see.

21:32.560 --> 21:34.313
You don't want to be
like your dad.

21:34.400 --> 21:36.596
I get that,
but it's too late.

21:36.680 --> 21:39.832
You're a criminal.
So am I.

21:39.920 --> 21:41.832
And those people out there,

21:41.920 --> 21:44.958
trust me, all they think is,
"Like father, like daughter."

21:45.640 --> 21:47.096
But I guess you need to find
that out for yourself,

21:47.120 --> 21:48.395
don't you?

21:52.680 --> 21:53.909
Find me when you do.

22:03.440 --> 22:04.510
Thank you.

22:04.600 --> 22:06.319
- Well... right.
- Yeah.

22:08.240 --> 22:10.232
That will hold you
until you get out... oh!

22:12.760 --> 22:13.816
Uh, can I ask you a question?

22:13.840 --> 22:15.160
Uh, do you have a minute?

22:15.240 --> 22:16.515
Yeah.

22:16.600 --> 22:17.829
Yes, you're not
going anywhere.

22:17.920 --> 22:21.630
So, um, last year, you came
out of the Speed Force

22:21.720 --> 22:25.031
and you were writing
a kind of a symbol language.

22:25.120 --> 22:26.120
Do you remember that?

22:26.200 --> 22:28.476
- Yeah, I remember.
- And apparently,

22:28.560 --> 22:30.836
Cisco could only translate
one of these phrases.

22:30.920 --> 22:31.920
Right?

22:32.000 --> 22:34.151
So far, yeah. I mean,
Gideon couldn't even do it.

22:35.200 --> 22:36.759
Gideon.

22:36.840 --> 22:38.559
Right, Gideon.

22:38.640 --> 22:40.791
So what do you think
that language was?

22:40.920 --> 22:44.197
I don't know. It was some
kind of, uh, chronolinguistics.

22:44.280 --> 22:46.040
Chronolinguistics
that you got from your time

22:46.120 --> 22:47.776
in the Speed Force, which
is all time at once, right?

22:47.800 --> 22:49.314
Past, present, future.

22:49.400 --> 22:51.256
What do you think this
language was? Future, maybe?

22:51.280 --> 22:54.079
Why? Is this about Cicada?

22:54.160 --> 22:58.677
Cicada? No, no.
No, It's just, um...

22:58.760 --> 23:00.240
<i>le mystère,</i> huh?

23:00.320 --> 23:02.056
I'm a detective.
I see mystery everywhere, so...

23:02.080 --> 23:04.151
- Uh-huh.
- Uh, all right. Thank you.

23:04.240 --> 23:05.515
See you next time.

23:05.600 --> 23:08.752
Okay... oh!
Ah, before I forget,

23:08.840 --> 23:11.514
the Legends, uh,
dropped off some, um, books

23:11.600 --> 23:13.000
to help you pass the time.

23:13.120 --> 23:15.760
- Huh.
<i>- Uncaged Desire.</i>

23:15.840 --> 23:17.593
You're kind of caged desire.

23:17.680 --> 23:19.637
- Hope you enjoy it.
- Huh.

23:19.720 --> 23:21.393
- See you next time.
- Thanks.

23:21.480 --> 23:23.233
Yeah, probably not very good.

23:23.320 --> 23:24.595
See you!

23:28.120 --> 23:29.236
<i>What is it?</i>

23:29.320 --> 23:32.472
According to Doppler, it's
a hurricane in Central City.

23:32.560 --> 23:35.234
No, it's not a hurricane.
It's Joss.

23:36.560 --> 23:37.560
I'm on it.

23:44.880 --> 23:46.519
What, no Flash today?

23:46.600 --> 23:48.876
Figured he wasn't needed
to stop a fake hurricane.

23:50.600 --> 23:52.910
Guess we can add
damaging private property

23:53.000 --> 23:54.559
to your résumé.

23:54.640 --> 23:55.760
Look, I just need your help.

23:55.800 --> 23:57.871
Oh, stop with the sorry act.

23:57.960 --> 23:59.872
That ended when your friend
helped you escape.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.152
She is not my buddy,
and I did not escape.

24:04.280 --> 24:05.873
Look,

24:05.960 --> 24:07.474
I want to turn myself back in.

24:07.560 --> 24:09.160
Oh, you really expect me
to believe that?

24:09.200 --> 24:12.079
My dad
is the career criminal,

24:12.160 --> 24:13.355
not me.

24:13.440 --> 24:15.272
I just...

24:17.080 --> 24:18.080
I want to show everybody

24:18.160 --> 24:20.675
that I'm not the person
that they think I am.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.353
Then what do you need me for?

24:22.480 --> 24:23.630
You're a hero.

24:23.720 --> 24:24.720
If you vouch for me,

24:24.800 --> 24:27.360
people will know
that I'm telling the truth.

24:27.440 --> 24:30.638
Look, I will tell you
everything.

24:30.720 --> 24:32.837
I'll even show you
where that woman took me.

24:34.480 --> 24:37.996
Just give me a chance.

24:43.200 --> 24:46.193
If anyone asks,
you never saw this.

24:46.280 --> 24:47.475
Thank you, Major Morgan.

24:47.560 --> 24:48.576
Please tell
the Lieutenant General

24:48.600 --> 24:49.800
that my dad and I owe him one.

24:54.640 --> 24:57.030
Special delivery.
One Weather Witch.

24:57.120 --> 24:59.760
What? I thought you were
gonna help me.

24:59.840 --> 25:01.194
I'm trying to turn myself in.

25:01.280 --> 25:04.637
No, I-I didn't escape.
I-I was kidnapped.

25:04.720 --> 25:05.790
Will you please tell them?

25:05.880 --> 25:08.190
Sorry,
I don't trust criminals.

25:08.280 --> 25:10.192
She's all yours.

25:10.320 --> 25:13.279
No! No, no!
This is a misunderstanding!

25:13.360 --> 25:14.476
This is unfair!

25:14.560 --> 25:16.631
If I could just talk to her,
please!

25:30.640 --> 25:32.677
<i>Your father does
the exact same thing.</i>

25:32.800 --> 25:35.838
When something's on his mind,
he runs.

25:35.920 --> 25:38.480
Nothing's on my mind, Mom.

25:38.560 --> 25:40.756
I got to take a look at
Raya Van Zandt's DOD file.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.433
Oh, yeah,
did you find the connection

25:42.560 --> 25:43.880
between her and Joss?

25:43.960 --> 25:46.794
Well, there doesn't seem
to be one.

25:46.880 --> 25:47.880
Really?

25:47.960 --> 25:50.475
<i>Yeah, she left the Air Force</i>

25:50.560 --> 25:52.677
after a failed mission
overseas,

25:52.760 --> 25:55.434
and then she spent two months
on desk duty,

25:55.520 --> 25:58.194
and then she was
dishonorably discharged.

25:59.920 --> 26:02.958
But it seems like she has
a pretty good service record.

26:03.080 --> 26:05.675
Exactly, so clearly
the DOD had egg on its face

26:05.760 --> 26:07.831
and Raya became its scapegoat.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.189
I'm just saying, Nora,

26:09.280 --> 26:11.078
not everyone is
as bad as they seem.

26:11.160 --> 26:15.677
Raya, Joss. I think everyone
deserves a second chance.

26:15.800 --> 26:18.315
If you don't believe me,
ask your father.

26:18.400 --> 26:20.835
He gives more second chances
than anyone I've ever met.

26:27.760 --> 26:31.151
Come on. Come on.

26:34.000 --> 26:38.597
Yes. Yes!
Yes, yes, yes!

26:41.320 --> 26:42.436
Yes!

26:55.720 --> 26:56.915
What the hell are you doing?

26:57.000 --> 26:58.957
What the hell
are <i>you</i> doing?

26:59.480 --> 27:02.279
Well, I was distilling
dark matter ore

27:02.360 --> 27:03.840
from Cicada's dagger shards.

27:03.920 --> 27:05.752
But I can't really
do that anymore, can I?

27:05.840 --> 27:06.840
Whoops.

27:06.920 --> 27:08.354
Why did you do that?

27:08.480 --> 27:10.631
You're smart.
You can figure it out.

27:10.720 --> 27:12.016
When are you
gonna figure out that

27:12.040 --> 27:13.560
a meta-cure could
actually help people?

27:13.640 --> 27:15.711
Listen, I heard all about it,
short stuff.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.280
But you know what?
Caity and I,

27:17.360 --> 27:18.999
we're doing just fine,

27:19.080 --> 27:22.232
and so were you until Cicada
got all up in your head.

27:22.320 --> 27:24.437
Don't do that.
This isn't just about me.

27:24.520 --> 27:25.590
<i>Oh, the hell it isn't!</i>

27:25.680 --> 27:27.558
And... and you know what?
I get it.

27:27.640 --> 27:29.359
He tried to kill you.

27:29.440 --> 27:31.671
<i>You're trying to create
something that'll save us all.</i>

27:31.760 --> 27:33.353
Yeah, I am!

27:33.440 --> 27:35.079
All of us!

27:35.160 --> 27:37.436
Barry, Iris, Nora,
they have a family.

27:37.520 --> 27:39.637
Even you and Caitlyn have
your weird little family.

27:39.760 --> 27:41.558
But what about my family?

27:41.680 --> 27:44.752
I want a wife
to grow old with.

27:44.840 --> 27:46.479
I want a kid.

27:46.600 --> 27:49.069
And I don't want them
to wonder all the time

27:49.160 --> 27:50.480
if their dad is in trouble,

27:50.560 --> 27:52.279
if he's even gonna
make it home tonight.

27:52.360 --> 27:54.216
Cisco, you don't have
to choose between having powers

27:54.240 --> 27:55.469
and having a family.

27:55.560 --> 27:57.552
Yeah?
Well, some of us do.

27:57.640 --> 27:59.518
I'm not the Flash.

28:00.800 --> 28:02.553
I don't want to be the Flash.

28:05.320 --> 28:06.674
I want to be me.

28:08.200 --> 28:09.634
A cure is the only way.

28:12.640 --> 28:14.438
Or it was.

28:22.720 --> 28:24.712
What?

28:24.800 --> 28:27.315
Oh, come on, girl.

28:29.400 --> 28:31.312
<i>You're reading Mick's book?</i>

28:31.400 --> 28:33.676
This is...

28:33.760 --> 28:36.036
surprisingly well-written.

28:39.880 --> 28:41.917
What's going on?

28:45.080 --> 28:48.357
Just having a hard time
believing

28:48.440 --> 28:50.352
some people can change.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.671
How come?

28:56.760 --> 28:59.878
'Cause after everything
that you've seen,

28:59.960 --> 29:02.156
don't you think that
bad people stay bad?

29:02.240 --> 29:03.356
<i>Not always.</i>

29:03.440 --> 29:06.433
When I first met Leonard Snart,
he was a criminal.

29:06.520 --> 29:08.273
Probably the worst criminal
in the city.

29:08.360 --> 29:09.396
But I...

29:09.480 --> 29:10.675
<i>you know, I knew</i>

29:10.760 --> 29:12.640
<i>that there was a good person
in there somewhere,</i>

29:12.720 --> 29:13.790
<i>and look at him.</i>

29:13.880 --> 29:15.439
Turned out to be a Legend.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.753
Died a hero.

29:18.840 --> 29:21.639
<i>If he can change,
anyone can.</i>

29:21.720 --> 29:23.393
You really believe that?

29:24.640 --> 29:26.597
Yeah. I do.

29:28.200 --> 29:31.830
What about Eobard Thawne?

29:35.760 --> 29:37.399
I think...

29:38.600 --> 29:40.080
part of being a hero

29:40.160 --> 29:42.720
is being able to see
the good in people.

29:43.960 --> 29:47.715
So yeah,
maybe someday in the future...

29:48.680 --> 29:52.276
even Thawne could change.

29:52.360 --> 29:55.319
Besides,
if we don't believe in people,

29:55.400 --> 29:56.720
who will?

30:18.640 --> 30:19.915
Very funny!

30:25.200 --> 30:26.953
I got 595s!

30:31.000 --> 30:32.753
<i>We got a lot of vehicles!
Let's go.</i>

30:32.840 --> 30:34.593
<i>Copy that. Suit up!</i>

30:34.680 --> 30:37.798
We've got multiple 595s
in our own parking lot!

30:37.880 --> 30:39.553
<i>Get out there quick!</i>

30:39.640 --> 30:41.518
<i>Requesting more backup!
We've got a lot!</i>

30:45.480 --> 30:47.039
What are you doing here?

30:48.560 --> 30:51.598
Doing what no one else
is gonna do for you...

30:55.440 --> 30:59.036
Offer you a second chance...

30:59.120 --> 31:00.440
Weather Witch.

31:09.640 --> 31:10.756
<i>That's it.</i>

31:10.840 --> 31:12.797
That's where
the power junction is.

31:12.880 --> 31:14.917
Give it everything you got.

31:33.880 --> 31:35.536
- What the hell was that?
<i>- I don't know, sir.</i>

31:35.560 --> 31:38.120
But it knocked out
security grids 41 through 60.

31:45.360 --> 31:47.795
Ten years
and $24 million later,

31:47.880 --> 31:51.157
the stealth automobile,
AKA the SAM, was born.

31:51.240 --> 31:53.197
Rumor has it that everything
under its hood

31:53.280 --> 31:55.033
comes directly from WayneTech.

32:02.360 --> 32:04.955
This is a $24-million
prototype?

32:06.520 --> 32:07.670
What can it do?

32:07.760 --> 32:09.638
Let's find out.

32:27.560 --> 32:29.199
Is it Joss or Raya?

32:29.280 --> 32:30.976
I'm guessing both
because someone just stole

32:31.000 --> 32:32.719
a very expensive vehicle
from A.R.G.U.S.

32:32.800 --> 32:34.473
after a very precise
lightning strike.

32:34.560 --> 32:36.119
It's a next-gen prototype

32:36.200 --> 32:37.634
<i>with all the bells
and whistles.</i>

32:37.720 --> 32:40.110
If bells and whistles could
explode and murder people.

32:40.200 --> 32:41.680
And supposedly
it's untrackable.

32:41.760 --> 32:43.080
<i>So how do we find it?</i>

32:43.160 --> 32:44.616
- We don't search for the car.
- We search for them.

32:44.640 --> 32:46.233
If Joss made lightning
strike again,

32:46.320 --> 32:47.436
<i>it means she has her staff.</i>

32:47.520 --> 32:49.557
Oh, so we can track
the dark matter in it. Nice!

32:49.640 --> 32:50.960
<i>I got the location.</i>

32:53.800 --> 32:55.917
<i>Okay, remember, Nora,
whatever you do,</i>

32:56.000 --> 32:58.515
<i>don't touch the car
while using your powers.</i>

32:58.600 --> 33:01.160
Hey, Caitlin, can I steal you
for a second?

33:18.080 --> 33:20.311
Joyride's over,
Silver Ghost.

33:20.400 --> 33:22.915
Joss,
I need to talk to you.

33:25.320 --> 33:26.595
Hard pass.

33:44.840 --> 33:48.151
Got to love
remote detonation.

34:03.160 --> 34:04.719
Icy roads ahead.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.833
Oh, my God. Whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Raya!

34:11.920 --> 34:13.717
Raya!

34:29.199 --> 34:30.475
<i>Holy Buckaroo Banzai.</i>

34:30.560 --> 34:32.552
It phases?

34:32.639 --> 34:34.359
Whatever phase-trick
they just used,

34:34.440 --> 34:35.476
it jammed our tracking.

34:35.560 --> 34:36.789
We can't get a lock on them

34:36.880 --> 34:38.335
if she doesn't use
that weather staff.

34:38.360 --> 34:40.750
XS is gonna come after us.

34:40.840 --> 34:41.876
Let her try.

34:51.159 --> 34:53.914
<i>Hear no evil, see no evil.</i>

34:54.000 --> 34:55.592
We're invisible.

34:59.800 --> 35:01.234
Hey, Cisco?

35:01.320 --> 35:03.312
Can you connect me
to the car's comm system?

35:03.400 --> 35:05.915
No, but best I can do is
have you send out radio waves,

35:06.040 --> 35:08.111
and if the car's nearby,
it'll pick them up.

35:08.200 --> 35:09.554
Do it.

35:12.800 --> 35:16.680
<i>Joss? Joss, it's XS.
I hope you can hear me.</i>

35:18.400 --> 35:20.835
You tried to tell me
something earlier.

35:20.920 --> 35:22.600
<i>You tried to tell me
that you wanted to pay</i>

35:22.640 --> 35:24.632
<i>for the crimes
that you committed.</i>

35:24.720 --> 35:26.677
<i>You said you weren't
a criminal like your father.</i>

35:26.760 --> 35:28.638
You asked me to give you
a second chance,

35:28.720 --> 35:30.120
<i>but I didn't listen.</i>

35:30.200 --> 35:32.669
Now I'm asking you
for a second chance.

35:32.760 --> 35:35.992
<i>Joss,
this isn't who you are.</i>

35:41.080 --> 35:42.878
Nora, the car's headed
straight for you.

35:42.960 --> 35:45.600
I don't see anything.

35:51.640 --> 35:53.154
<i>Nora, look out!</i>

36:01.240 --> 36:03.391
How the hell
did I lose control?

36:06.320 --> 36:08.198
Hey, hold on to me.
This is gonna feel weird.

36:13.120 --> 36:16.079
Well, at least
we got their wheels.

36:16.160 --> 36:17.355
What's left of them.

36:17.440 --> 36:19.511
Thanks for
the last-minute rescue.

36:19.600 --> 36:22.035
- For the what?
- Icing up the road.

36:22.120 --> 36:23.520
I didn't ice the road.

36:23.600 --> 36:25.637
What? Who...

36:34.360 --> 36:36.113
And...

36:36.200 --> 36:38.112
time! 24 hours are up.

36:38.200 --> 36:40.192
Okay, I double-checked
with Caitlin,

36:40.280 --> 36:42.216
and there doesn't seem to be
any unstable dark matter

36:42.240 --> 36:43.356
in your biometric scans.

36:43.440 --> 36:45.671
Okay.

36:53.400 --> 36:54.880
Man, it feels good
to be out of there.

36:54.920 --> 36:56.080
We definitely missed you,
Dad.

36:56.160 --> 36:57.936
Sorry I haven't been able
to help with everything.

36:57.960 --> 36:59.376
Do we know where
Joss and Raya are now?

36:59.400 --> 37:00.400
No, we got nothing yet.

37:00.480 --> 37:01.675
But you were right
about Joss.

37:01.760 --> 37:02.910
She saved my life.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.360
If she hadn't iced over
the road...

37:04.440 --> 37:06.397
But she did because
you connected with her.

37:06.480 --> 37:07.480
<i>It's like Dad said,</i>

37:07.560 --> 37:09.711
she just needed someone
to believe in her.

37:09.800 --> 37:11.598
Sounds like you found
your own Leonard Snart.

37:11.680 --> 37:14.036
Well, time might prove me wrong,
but I think so.

37:14.120 --> 37:15.190
I hope so.

37:15.280 --> 37:17.237
I'm sorry I messed up
your first day back.

37:17.320 --> 37:19.960
It's all right, Nora.
There's always day two.

37:20.040 --> 37:21.713
- I'm happy you're back.
- Thanks.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.399
Hey, do you wanna
help me find Cisco?

37:23.480 --> 37:25.756
I gotta get this extrapolator
thing recalibrated.

37:25.840 --> 37:29.038
I went to go see Joe in Tibet,
and I ended up in Fiji.

37:31.160 --> 37:34.278
Being a parent
sure is hard sometimes.

37:34.360 --> 37:36.556
Yeah, it is.

37:36.640 --> 37:38.472
But there's nothing like it.

37:53.520 --> 37:56.399
Okay, well, we can't both
be the basket case.

37:56.480 --> 37:58.039
"We're all pretty bizarre.

37:58.120 --> 38:00.396
Some of us are just better
at hiding it."

38:00.480 --> 38:01.880
Come on, <i>Breakfast Club?</i>

38:01.960 --> 38:03.235
It's one of the only movies

38:03.320 --> 38:05.118
Killer Frost and I
actually agree on.

38:05.200 --> 38:06.256
Let me guess,
she's into Bender?

38:06.280 --> 38:08.397
- Totally. She loves him.
- Yeah, makes sense.

38:08.480 --> 38:09.914
- I'd ship that.
<i>- Put that on.</i>

38:10.000 --> 38:12.356
It's cold where we're going.

38:19.040 --> 38:20.110
Your dad's old lab.

38:20.200 --> 38:21.839
- Mm-hmm.
- Cool.

38:21.920 --> 38:24.435
Caitlin,
why did you bring me here?

38:24.520 --> 38:27.160
Because despite our
last encounter with him,

38:27.280 --> 38:29.397
he did create a meta-gene.

38:29.480 --> 38:31.836
So I was thinking that you
could use his research

38:31.920 --> 38:33.752
to do the reverse.

38:33.840 --> 38:36.230
Um, okay,

38:36.320 --> 38:39.233
don't look now, but if I
didn't know any better,

38:39.320 --> 38:44.554
I'd say this feels a lot
like you helping me

38:44.640 --> 38:46.950
make a meta-human cure.

38:47.040 --> 38:48.200
I couldn't stop
thinking about

38:48.240 --> 38:50.357
what you said
about how a cure

38:50.440 --> 38:54.559
would give you a second chance
at a normal life.

38:54.640 --> 38:57.235
No friend would stand
in the way of that.

38:57.320 --> 39:02.190
But there is a difference
between you standing in my way

39:02.280 --> 39:05.591
and you actively helping me.

39:05.680 --> 39:08.434
I still think this is
dangerous, but...

39:08.520 --> 39:11.274
maybe if I'm involved,
we can have some ground rules.

39:11.360 --> 39:13.556
Like the first
and most important,

39:13.640 --> 39:17.873
we will never,
ever force a cure on anyone.

39:19.560 --> 39:21.472
Okay.

39:21.560 --> 39:23.677
Rule number one.

39:24.360 --> 39:26.636
We're not just here
to make a cure.

39:27.600 --> 39:28.920
We're here to make a choice.

39:48.440 --> 39:49.874
Nora.

39:51.640 --> 39:54.109
You either trust me,
or you don't.

39:56.160 --> 39:57.833
There's no in-between.

39:59.240 --> 40:01.357
Fine.

40:01.440 --> 40:03.591
I don't trust you.

40:03.680 --> 40:06.434
But I'm willing to give you
the chance to change my mind.

40:08.360 --> 40:11.114
Well,
that might take some time.

40:11.200 --> 40:15.831
And time,
as you may recall,

40:15.920 --> 40:18.799
is not on my side.

40:18.880 --> 40:20.837
Minutes are minutes,

40:20.920 --> 40:24.038
seconds are seconds,

40:24.120 --> 40:26.794
and there's very few
of them left.

40:35.400 --> 40:36.834
I want to believe that

40:36.920 --> 40:38.720
there is good inside
of you somewhere, Thawne.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.798
Let me prove there is.

40:52.120 --> 40:53.156
Okay.

41:00.240 --> 41:02.152
What's next?

41:30.160 --> 41:32.595
<i>Hello, Dr. Wells.</i>

41:32.680 --> 41:36.117
Hello, Gideon.

41:36.200 --> 41:38.669
I have access to all the files?

41:38.760 --> 41:40.592
- Right?
<i>- Of course.</i>

41:40.680 --> 41:42.956
<i>Which files would you
like me to locate?</i>

41:43.040 --> 41:46.431
I would like you
to locate the files

41:46.520 --> 41:48.432
from Nora West-Allen.

41:48.520 --> 41:49.590
<i>I'm sorry, Dr. Wells,</i>

41:49.680 --> 41:51.416
<i>but all entries have been
permanently deleted</i>

41:51.440 --> 41:52.760
<i>by Nora West-Allen.</i>

42:22.120 --> 42:23.554
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
