Peter, come on,
time to get dressed

00:36.786 --> 00:38.355
for our Valentine's Day dinner.

00:38.388 --> 00:40.124
We don't want to be late
for our reservation.

00:40.157 --> 00:41.558
Reservation?

00:41.591 --> 00:43.927
Yeah. I decided we're going
someplace nice this time.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.763
Not like last year when we went
to the Outback Steakhouse,

00:46.796 --> 00:49.133
but it's "out"
as in the gay way.

00:49.166 --> 00:52.902
We'll get to the specials,
but first, I need to tell you...

00:52.936 --> 00:54.404
I'm gay.

00:54.438 --> 00:55.639
The hell you are!

00:55.672 --> 00:57.407
No waiter of mine
is gonna be gay!

00:57.441 --> 00:59.643
Peter, please. He's our waiter.

00:59.676 --> 01:01.645
He's the only waiter we have.

01:01.678 --> 01:03.913
Lois, our waiter is dead to us.

01:03.947 --> 01:06.783
We have to focus all our
attention on our hostess now.

01:06.816 --> 01:09.386
He-he just needs a little time.

01:09.419 --> 01:10.920
(weakly):
Scott...

01:10.954 --> 01:15.225
I'm finally ready
to hear the specials.

01:15.259 --> 01:16.993
Well, happy Valentine's Day,
Lois.

01:17.026 --> 01:20.164
Let's have a dying marriage
side-face kiss.

01:20.197 --> 01:21.498
Mwah.

01:21.531 --> 01:24.334
Well, I better set out
a can of tuna fish and a cigar

01:24.368 --> 01:25.835
for Arthur Valentine.

01:25.869 --> 01:28.738
I can't wait to see
what he brings me.

01:28.772 --> 01:31.675
Uh, you want to tell us
what the holy hell that was?

01:31.708 --> 01:33.743
(sighs) I'm afraid
it's something we made up

01:33.777 --> 01:35.779
that we finally
need to deal with.

01:35.812 --> 01:37.847
You see, years ago,
when Chris was in preschool...

01:40.016 --> 01:42.352
(crying)

01:42.386 --> 01:45.289
Peter, poor Chris didn't get
a single valentine today

01:45.322 --> 01:47.257
from any of his classmates.

01:47.291 --> 01:48.525
What? Why not?

01:48.558 --> 01:50.160
Apparently, he's not well liked.

01:50.194 --> 01:51.861
Some of the kids
think he's weird

01:51.895 --> 01:53.797
because he takes
his shirt off to pee.

01:53.830 --> 01:56.666
Yeah, I taught him that.
That's also called "peeing."

01:56.700 --> 01:58.468
Pee? Pee now?

01:58.502 --> 01:59.869
No. No, Chris.

01:59.903 --> 02:03.373
(crying):
Why no valentines?

02:03.407 --> 02:05.542
Hey, hey, hey,
stop crying, Chris.

02:05.575 --> 02:06.710
Y-You're gonna...

02:06.743 --> 02:09.112
Y-You're gonna get
tons of valentines.

02:09.145 --> 02:11.448
I am? From who?

02:11.481 --> 02:15.285
Um, from... Arthur Valentine.

02:15.319 --> 02:16.786
R-Really?

02:16.820 --> 02:18.555
Yeah, yeah, that's right!

02:18.588 --> 02:21.191
Who's Arthur Valentine?

02:21.225 --> 02:23.393
Only the most magical man ever.

02:23.427 --> 02:26.796
And he comes every
Valentine's Day on-on a-a...

02:26.830 --> 02:29.366
a purple Vespa to, um...

02:29.399 --> 02:31.668
to bring candy and sweet notes
to children

02:31.701 --> 02:34.204
who've managed to not use
any swears in the last year.

02:34.238 --> 02:35.205
He does?

02:35.239 --> 02:37.407
Uh-huh, and he has
a long beard...

02:37.441 --> 02:39.008
Oh, and-and he's got
an eye patch.

02:39.042 --> 02:41.545
B-But not for medical reasons,
he just likes the look.

02:41.578 --> 02:44.047
Plus, he-he wears
a Cat in the Hat hat

02:44.080 --> 02:46.550
and sometimes a scarf,
no matter what Lois says

02:46.583 --> 02:48.385
because it gives him
a youthful vibe

02:48.418 --> 02:50.587
and adds some color to his face.

02:50.620 --> 02:53.257
We were just trying
to cheer Chris up.

02:53.290 --> 02:55.259
I assumed he'd outgrow it
in a few years,

02:55.292 --> 02:58.094
but, Peter, it's time
we have a talk with Chris.

02:58.127 --> 03:01.097
We've got to put an end to this
Arthur Valentine nonsense.

03:01.130 --> 03:03.233
(sighs) Yeah, I guess
you're right.

03:03.267 --> 03:05.335
Well, I best be going anyway.

03:05.369 --> 03:07.771
Donna and I are spending
our Valentine's Day

03:07.804 --> 03:10.774
in Johnnie Cochran pajamas,
just caressing each other

03:10.807 --> 03:12.776
in a very beige bedroom.

03:12.809 --> 03:14.444
Yeah, and hopefully
Bonnie and I'll

03:14.478 --> 03:16.346
do a sexy bath night
like last year.

03:16.380 --> 03:17.847
It was amazing.

03:17.881 --> 03:20.116
She laid out a trail
of rose petals,

03:20.149 --> 03:22.952
and I elbow-crawled
to the sponge and shower chair.

03:22.986 --> 03:25.889
I go down to the video store
and put my hand on Love Actually

03:25.922 --> 03:27.957
at the same time as a woman,
and I go,

03:27.991 --> 03:31.561
(laughing): "Oh, ho, ho, ho!
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!"

03:31.595 --> 03:34.931
What about you, Brian? What are
your plans for Valentine's Day?

03:34.964 --> 03:38.468
What? Oh, uh,
no real plans, I guess.

03:38.502 --> 03:41.137
Ha! Looks like Brian's the only
guy with nothing going on.

03:41.170 --> 03:43.039
Hey, you can come over
to my house, Brian.

03:43.072 --> 03:44.908
I thought you had
that whole thing with Bonnie.

03:44.941 --> 03:48.478
I do, but she needs help lifting
me into the shower chair.

03:53.583 --> 03:54.984
Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker.

03:55.018 --> 03:58.288
Our top story, today
the Quahog River was dyed red

03:58.322 --> 03:59.823
in honor of Valentine's Day.

03:59.856 --> 04:01.991
So if you're looking
to do a river murder,

04:02.025 --> 04:03.493
this could be your window.

04:03.527 --> 04:06.330
(slurring):
Stupid Hallmark holiday anyway.

04:06.363 --> 04:08.131
Oh, hey, Bri.
How's your night going?

04:08.164 --> 04:11.401
I hope Rupert and I haven't been
too loud up there.

04:11.435 --> 04:15.004
-Happy Valentine's Day!
-(clanking loudly)

04:15.038 --> 04:17.341
Oh, yeah,
we're gonna go all night.

04:17.374 --> 04:20.510
Just leave me alone, Stewie.

04:20.544 --> 04:23.680
Well, Brian, if you're stuck
being a single loser,

04:23.713 --> 04:26.015
you might as well
just embrace it.

04:26.049 --> 04:29.653
Mmm. Oh, yeah. (grunts)

04:29.686 --> 04:31.120
Wait a minute.
What am I thinking?

04:31.154 --> 04:34.190
Chocolate is poisonous to dogs.
I better stop or...

04:37.394 --> 04:40.830
-(pot clanking loudly)
-STEWIE: Happy Valentine's Day!

04:40.864 --> 04:42.466
CLEVELAND:
Stop the damn banging!

04:42.499 --> 04:46.002
People are trying to have
dignified relations!

04:50.874 --> 04:52.275
Oh, boy, look!

04:52.308 --> 04:55.812
Arthur Valentine brought me
plates and a salt shaker!

04:55.845 --> 04:57.481
Chris, Chris, settle down.

04:57.514 --> 04:59.349
I-It's actually time
your father and I

04:59.383 --> 05:01.718
had a talk with you
about Arthur Valentine.

05:01.751 --> 05:03.219
Yeah, that's, uh, that's right.

05:03.252 --> 05:06.055
Um, son...

05:06.089 --> 05:08.492
I'm afraid Arthur Valentine
isn't real.

05:08.525 --> 05:10.860
What? Not real?
(chuckles)

05:10.894 --> 05:13.897
Then who leaves those notes
with all the misspellings?

05:13.930 --> 05:17.166
Well, first, Chris, English
is a very fluid language.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.836
We're sorry, but you're old
enough now to know the truth.

05:19.869 --> 05:22.572
He... he doesn't exist.

05:22.606 --> 05:26.009
(gasps) No! You're both lying!

05:26.042 --> 05:28.177
(sighs) What are we gonna do?

05:28.211 --> 05:30.580
It seems like there's
no getting through to him.

05:30.614 --> 05:33.016
You know, if Chris
is this hard to convince,

05:33.049 --> 05:35.485
we may just have to kill
Arthur Valentine.

05:35.519 --> 05:36.986
What? What do you mean?

05:37.020 --> 05:41.057
Maybe we make Chris believe
that Arthur Valentine is dead.

05:41.090 --> 05:44.594
Huh. Well, we just
might have to.

05:47.531 --> 05:49.065
Hey, what's the matter, Brian?

05:49.098 --> 05:51.668
Have you fallen
and can't get up?

05:51.701 --> 05:54.170
Turns out, still using
that joke is a felony.

05:54.203 --> 05:56.940
Guess I better not
drop the soap.

05:56.973 --> 05:59.142
That one's the death penalty.

06:02.812 --> 06:03.947
You were very lucky.

06:03.980 --> 06:06.416
We managed to pump your stomach
just in time.

06:06.450 --> 06:07.784
Oh, thank God.

06:07.817 --> 06:09.719
I had him pump my stomach, too.
Doc, what was in there?

06:09.753 --> 06:11.187
Well, it's a pretty
extensive list.

06:11.220 --> 06:12.456
I'm gonna need Billy Joel
to help me out.

06:12.489 --> 06:14.357

"We Didn't Start the Fire")

06:14.390 --> 06:17.461

Wow, that was great, Billy!

06:43.653 --> 06:46.723
Hey, does anyone call you
Bill Joel or William Joel?

06:46.756 --> 06:49.826
Uh, no. Does anyone call you
Petey Griffin?

06:49.859 --> 06:51.761
No, they don't,
because I'm an adult,

06:51.795 --> 06:54.197
which is kind of
what I was getting at.

06:58.602 --> 07:01.671
Ugh. Who sends a Christmas card
to their vet?

07:01.705 --> 07:03.907
I know. It's so lame, right?

07:03.940 --> 07:06.843
And did you see the lady outside
with the empty cat carrier?

07:06.876 --> 07:08.678
Ugh. Cry much?

07:08.712 --> 07:11.180
Yeah. Yeah, I bet she actually
thinks that thing loved her.

07:11.214 --> 07:13.783
(chuckles) Hey, I'm Brian.

07:13.817 --> 07:14.851
Shake.

07:14.884 --> 07:16.452
Nice to meet you. I'm Ellie.

07:16.486 --> 07:17.854
What are you in for?

07:17.887 --> 07:20.323
Uh, I got this small cut,
and they wanted to bandage it

07:20.356 --> 07:22.692
so I'd stop chewing
the crap out of my foot.

07:22.726 --> 07:25.261
Aw, that sucks. I love chewing
the crap out of my foot.

07:25.294 --> 07:26.429
I know, it's the best.

07:26.462 --> 07:28.464
But while I was here,
I also had to get...

07:28.498 --> 07:29.533
(dog barking nearby)

07:29.566 --> 07:32.702
(both barking)

07:32.736 --> 07:34.203
...a prescription filled.

07:34.237 --> 07:35.539
Listen, I got to go.

07:35.572 --> 07:37.440
You want to
continue this sometime?

07:37.473 --> 07:40.043
Let me give you my number.
It's on the back of here.

07:40.076 --> 07:42.078
-It's this.
-Got it.

07:43.847 --> 07:46.683
See you around, Brian.

07:46.716 --> 07:48.351
Definitely.

07:48.384 --> 07:50.386
Bye, Ellie.

07:50.419 --> 07:53.056
(German accent): Is this
the Veteran Aryan's office?

07:53.089 --> 07:55.291
No, this is the veterinarian's.

07:55.324 --> 07:58.695
I think you want the Veteran
Aryan's Center next door.

07:58.728 --> 08:02.298
Ah, I see the confusion.
This must happen all the time.

08:02.331 --> 08:03.900
We're ready
for the German shepherd.

08:03.933 --> 08:05.501
(German accent):
Ja, that would be me.

08:05.535 --> 08:07.571
This is a very confusing lobby.

08:14.878 --> 08:16.680
(chuckling)

08:24.020 --> 08:25.388
Hey. Hey.

08:25.421 --> 08:28.191
You think you could be with me?
Right here? In this place?

08:28.224 --> 08:29.659
Oh, yeah, yeah, sorry.
Sorry, Stewie.

08:29.693 --> 08:31.094
It's-it's just...

08:31.127 --> 08:34.664
I met someone amazing the other
day at the vet's office, and...

08:34.698 --> 08:36.365
Well, she's actually a dog.

08:36.399 --> 08:38.902
And it's so great dating someone
who understands

08:38.935 --> 08:41.671
why it's especially important
to walk around in a circle

08:41.705 --> 08:43.673
many, many times
before lying down.

08:43.707 --> 08:45.274
So, that's who
you were texting with?

08:45.308 --> 08:47.343
Sort of. I-I was just rereading
some of the texts

08:47.376 --> 08:48.845
I already sent her.

08:48.878 --> 08:50.847
(chuckles) That's good.

08:50.880 --> 08:52.248
You're rereading your own texts?

08:52.281 --> 08:54.117
Yeah, do you,
do you not do that?

08:54.150 --> 08:56.252
Nobody does that.

09:01.124 --> 09:03.526
Golden Eagle to Red Shrew.
Ready for the plan?

09:03.559 --> 09:05.061
Come in, Red Shrew.

09:05.094 --> 09:07.931
LOIS (over walkie): Peter, we
did not decide on those names.

09:07.964 --> 09:11.534
Chris, come down here, quick!
I see Arthur Valentine outside!

09:11.567 --> 09:13.302
I think he's come to say hi!

09:13.336 --> 09:14.303
Really?!

09:14.337 --> 09:15.739
Yeah, look.

09:17.240 --> 09:19.275
Oh, my God. Hi, Arthur!

09:19.308 --> 09:22.445
I love you so much,
and I haven't cussed once today!

09:22.478 --> 09:25.649
Dad, get the bowl of tuna
from under my bed!

09:30.419 --> 09:32.321
(screams) Arthur!

09:32.355 --> 09:34.590
Oh, my God, he's dead.

09:34.624 --> 09:35.825
He's dead!

09:35.859 --> 09:37.627
(sobbing loudly)

09:39.629 --> 09:44.333
Mission accomplished, Red Shrew.
Over and out.

09:44.367 --> 09:46.369
Huh. That looks tasty.

09:47.971 --> 09:51.174
Little walkie-talkie piece.

09:56.880 --> 09:59.448
God, I forgot
how much I love art.

09:59.482 --> 10:01.084
Hey, who's your favorite artist?

10:01.117 --> 10:02.852
Me? Uh...

10:02.886 --> 10:04.287
(stammers)

10:04.320 --> 10:06.690
You know, I really like,
uh, that Jackson "Polack."

10:06.723 --> 10:09.025
You know, I-I know they're not
supposed to be that bright,

10:09.058 --> 10:10.927
but that was, that was
pretty genius, you know?

10:10.960 --> 10:13.763
I mean, leave it, leave it to
a Polack to just grab the paint

10:13.797 --> 10:15.765
with his hands and just start
chucking it everywhere.

10:15.799 --> 10:17.033
I mean, it's great.

10:17.066 --> 10:18.935
It's pronounced "Pollock."
(chuckles)

10:18.968 --> 10:21.504
But, Brian, you don't
have to keep trying so hard

10:21.537 --> 10:22.672
to impress me.

10:22.706 --> 10:24.440
I already really like you.

10:24.473 --> 10:26.109
You do? Thanks.

10:26.142 --> 10:28.644
I-I really like you, too, Ellie.

10:28.678 --> 10:32.515
Truth is, I haven't felt this
way with anyone in a long time.

10:32.548 --> 10:34.483
Listen, I'm really sorry
to cut things short,

10:34.517 --> 10:36.652
but I've got to go;
I have rehearsal.

10:36.686 --> 10:38.621
-Oh, what, for a play?
-No.

10:38.654 --> 10:41.858
It's kind of dumb,
but it's for a dog show.

10:41.891 --> 10:43.159
Oh, you're a show dog?

10:43.192 --> 10:45.394
No wonder you have
such a perfectly coiffed anus.

10:45.428 --> 10:46.462
Thank you.

10:46.495 --> 10:48.464
No, thank you. It's perfect.

10:48.497 --> 10:51.134
I mean, I... God, I-I bet every
time you go snarfling on it,

10:51.167 --> 10:52.969
you have to stop and admire it.

10:53.002 --> 10:53.970
Come on, now, Brian.

10:54.003 --> 10:56.005
A lady has to have
a few secrets.

10:58.007 --> 11:00.143
Man, she is something else.

11:00.176 --> 11:03.146
This must be how Ronald Reagan
felt about Nancy.

11:03.179 --> 11:06.482
Nancy, will you make me
the happiest man in the world

11:06.515 --> 11:08.918
by turning a blind eye
to the AIDS crisis

11:08.952 --> 11:12.155
and ineffectually trying to warn
young people about drugs?

11:12.188 --> 11:13.156
Yes!

11:13.189 --> 11:14.824
Oh, yes, Ronnie! Yes!

11:14.858 --> 11:16.492
SINGERS:
♪ If you're too young ♪

11:16.525 --> 11:19.228
♪ Those are both
things she did! ♪

11:24.233 --> 11:27.003
Peter, I'm really worried
about Chris.

11:27.036 --> 11:29.272
The shock of seeing
Arthur Valentine die

11:29.305 --> 11:31.174
seems to have
really gotten to him.

11:31.207 --> 11:34.343
I-I've never seen him
so depressed and catatonic.

11:34.377 --> 11:35.678
Well, you know, in Awakenings,

11:35.711 --> 11:37.914
Robin Williams tossed a baseball
to Robert De Niro,

11:37.947 --> 11:39.749
and he snapped out of it
and caught it.

11:39.783 --> 11:41.084
M-Maybe we do that.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.887
Chris, you doing okay?

11:43.920 --> 11:45.554
It's Mom and Dad.

11:45.588 --> 11:47.356
We thought we'd-- Awakenings!

11:47.390 --> 11:48.624
Peter, I'm not sure that's...

11:48.657 --> 11:49.625
Awakenings!

11:49.658 --> 11:50.726
You're gonna hurt him if you...

11:50.760 --> 11:51.727
Awakenings!

11:51.761 --> 11:53.096
Peter, knock it off.

11:53.129 --> 11:56.132
I never thought Chris would
take things so hard.

11:56.165 --> 11:58.968
I think we went too far
by killing Arthur Valentine.

11:59.002 --> 12:00.904
We have to bring him
back to life.

12:00.937 --> 12:02.438
What? Are you serious?

12:02.471 --> 12:05.141
It's the only thing
that'll snap him out of it.

12:05.174 --> 12:07.911
Well, maybe, but what if
I try it with a basketball?

12:07.944 --> 12:09.245
Awakenings!

12:09.278 --> 12:10.914
Oh, God, that broke his nose.

12:10.947 --> 12:13.616
He didn't even flinch.
It's bad. Let's do your thing.

12:13.649 --> 12:15.885
Let's-let's twirl some
toilet paper up into his nose,

12:15.919 --> 12:18.587
and-and then when...
we'll-we'll do your thing.

12:22.425 --> 12:23.993
Wow, thanks again.

12:24.027 --> 12:25.728
What a nice dinner.

12:25.761 --> 12:27.831
I'm so lucky
to have met you, Brian.

12:27.864 --> 12:29.899
You're such an amazing guy.

12:29.933 --> 12:32.235
I'd say we're both lucky.

12:32.268 --> 12:33.502
Oh, no, no, no, wait!

12:33.536 --> 12:35.271
(sighs) Don't-don't do that.

12:35.304 --> 12:36.840
What-what? What's the matter?

12:36.873 --> 12:38.507
Oh, brutal.

12:38.541 --> 12:41.177
Yeah, that's gonna be
a terrible car ride, man.

12:41.210 --> 12:44.180
I would hate to be you,
and I'm me.

12:44.213 --> 12:45.581
I'm really sorry, Brian.

12:45.614 --> 12:47.583
It's not that I don't
want to kiss you.

12:47.616 --> 12:51.087
I smell the poop on your breath,
and then that's all I want,

12:51.120 --> 12:53.189
but my owners
made an arrangement

12:53.222 --> 12:55.524
with the organizers
of the next dog show.

12:55.558 --> 12:58.261
They paid a lot of money
to schedule me to breed

12:58.294 --> 13:00.964
with whichever male dog
wins the competition.

13:00.997 --> 13:03.867
What, like... like breed breed?

13:03.900 --> 13:05.534
I know it might seem odd to you,

13:05.568 --> 13:08.137
but this happens
in the dog show world.

13:08.171 --> 13:10.974
I have to have sex with
whichever male dog wins,

13:11.007 --> 13:12.741
whoever that ends up being.

13:15.211 --> 13:18.514
Stewie, we're entering
a dog show!

13:18.547 --> 13:20.316
-Where's Stewie?
-STEWIE (muffled): He ate me!

13:20.349 --> 13:22.485
-I ate him.
-♪ He ate Stewie, holy crap ♪

13:22.518 --> 13:24.187
♪ Family Guy
will be right back! ♪

13:30.226 --> 13:32.061
All right, Brian.
Now, if we're going to get you

13:32.095 --> 13:33.562
ready to compete
in that dog show,

13:33.596 --> 13:35.231
we've got a lot
of training to cover.

13:35.264 --> 13:37.400
Let's begin by doing
some work with the clicker.

13:37.433 --> 13:38.902
-(clicker clicks)
-Oh, yeah, I've seen these.

13:38.935 --> 13:40.904
You click it when
you want me to do a trick,

13:40.937 --> 13:43.039
and then I get a treat,
so I associate the two.

13:43.072 --> 13:45.241
No. I use it
to punctuate my jokes.

13:45.274 --> 13:48.344
Now, Brian you've got to roll
over and be good on all fours.

13:48.377 --> 13:50.413
If Nathan Lane can do it,
so can you.

13:50.446 --> 13:52.348
-(clicker clicks)
-Okay. (chuckles)

13:52.381 --> 13:54.884
But maybe we should just focus
on getting ready for the show.

13:54.918 --> 13:56.585
Well, look who wants
to be prepared.

13:56.619 --> 13:58.922
-You're a regular Beagle Scout.
-(clicker clicks)

13:58.955 --> 14:01.857
Wait, shouldn't I be the one
who clicks if I like the joke?

14:01.891 --> 14:03.859
You can't just click
after everything you say.

14:03.893 --> 14:06.429
If it's funny, I can.
And so far, they've all landed.

14:06.462 --> 14:09.265
Unlike the planes on 9/11.

14:09.298 --> 14:10.833
See? No click.

14:10.866 --> 14:12.668
That one was in poor taste.
Not funny.

14:12.701 --> 14:14.938
You know, I was supposed to be
on one of those planes.

14:14.971 --> 14:16.305
Yeah, me, too.

14:21.810 --> 14:24.447
Um, yes. Brian Griffin.

14:24.480 --> 14:25.614
ELLIE:
Brian?

14:25.648 --> 14:27.283
What are you doing here?

14:27.316 --> 14:28.617
(chuckles):
Oh, hey!

14:28.651 --> 14:30.954
Uh, you know, I...
You-you just made dog shows

14:30.987 --> 14:33.889
sound so fun the other day,
I-I thought I'd give it a try.

14:33.923 --> 14:36.359
Who knows?
Maybe I'll end up top dog.

14:36.392 --> 14:38.061
And on top of you.
(chuckles)

14:38.094 --> 14:39.595
-(clicker clicks)
-Thanks, Stewie.

14:39.628 --> 14:42.431
Brian, most of these dogs
have been training since birth.

14:42.465 --> 14:43.967
Are you sure
you're ready for this?

14:44.000 --> 14:46.469
You bet I am.
I've never been so prepared.

14:46.502 --> 14:48.204
I'm a regular Beagle Scout.

14:48.237 --> 14:50.239
(both laughing)

14:52.508 --> 14:53.809
That's hilarious.

14:53.842 --> 14:55.078
Good luck, Brian.

14:55.111 --> 14:57.613
(laughs)

15:02.986 --> 15:05.054
Chris, you got to
snap out of this.

15:05.088 --> 15:08.057
I mean, I've been
where you're at.

15:08.091 --> 15:10.659
(quietly): Listen,
I've never told anyone this,

15:10.693 --> 15:13.896
but I killed a jaywalker
in 2002.

15:13.929 --> 15:16.332
She looked old,
but she was only 51.

15:16.365 --> 15:18.334
I mean, back then,
that was old to me.

15:18.367 --> 15:21.437
It's why I always talk
and ask questions so much.

15:21.470 --> 15:25.174
When there's any moment
of quiet, I think about her.

15:25.208 --> 15:27.643
That's why all mothers do that.

15:27.676 --> 15:31.147
Every mother has killed someone.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.082
Now drink your ginger ale.

15:33.116 --> 15:34.350
Hey, hey, hey!

15:34.383 --> 15:35.985
It's Arthur Valentine,

15:36.019 --> 15:38.521
here to accelerate awkwardly
into a bush.

15:39.955 --> 15:41.857
Damn it!

15:44.127 --> 15:46.629
Arthur...

15:46.662 --> 15:48.364
Valentine?

15:48.397 --> 15:50.499
Chris! You're okay!

15:50.533 --> 15:52.701
But I saw him die.

15:52.735 --> 15:54.870
That can only mean one thing.

15:54.903 --> 15:56.705
He must be a zombie!

15:56.739 --> 15:58.774
What? No! No, no. What?!

15:58.807 --> 16:01.044
(yelling)

16:01.077 --> 16:02.311
(screams) Stop!

16:02.345 --> 16:03.546
What the hell are you doing?!

16:03.579 --> 16:04.547
(screams)

16:04.580 --> 16:06.049
I've seen The Walking Dead!

16:06.082 --> 16:07.616
I have to destroy your brain

16:07.650 --> 16:09.718
and then talk about it
for the next hour!

16:09.752 --> 16:11.187
-Chris, take it easy!
-Get off of him!

16:11.220 --> 16:13.189
-You're gonna kill me!
-It's not what you think!

16:14.923 --> 16:16.025
Dad?

16:16.059 --> 16:17.493
But... I don't...

16:17.526 --> 16:18.727
I... How did...

16:18.761 --> 16:20.896
I'm not Arthur Valentine, son.

16:20.929 --> 16:22.798
We're so sorry, Chris.

16:22.831 --> 16:24.733
Now do you understand?

16:24.767 --> 16:27.403
There is no Arthur Valentine?

16:27.436 --> 16:29.772
We never meant
to hurt you, buddy.

16:33.276 --> 16:36.245
JOE: Valentine's Day would
take on new meaning for Chris

16:36.279 --> 16:37.980
in the years to come,

16:38.013 --> 16:42.318
but he would remember none
so bittersweetly as this one.

16:42.351 --> 16:45.888
This is Joe Swanson,
signing off.

16:45.921 --> 16:47.423
BONNIE:
Joe, your mom died.

16:47.456 --> 16:49.125
Seriously?

16:55.698 --> 16:58.033
How you doing?
You feeling good?

16:58.067 --> 17:00.669
Because this thing is gonna
come down to the arbitrary whims

17:00.703 --> 17:02.338
of whatever elderly volunteers

17:02.371 --> 17:04.740
were able to get transportation
here on a Tuesday.

17:04.773 --> 17:06.542
Yeah, I... Hey, watch it!

17:06.575 --> 17:08.111
The hell's his problem?

17:08.144 --> 17:09.712
Careful.
That's your competition.

17:09.745 --> 17:11.080
His name's Max.

17:11.114 --> 17:14.217
He's a four-time winner
and kind of a crowd favorite.

Uh-huh. They have to certify
the union, Brian.

18:58.754 --> 19:00.223
Stud is ready to mount.

19:00.256 --> 19:01.624
Please turn up the lights.

19:01.657 --> 19:03.726
What? No!
No, the opposite!

19:03.759 --> 19:05.294
In fact, could someone
maybe turn on

19:05.328 --> 19:07.230
some-some Drake or The Weeknd?

19:07.263 --> 19:09.698
Ha! He's blowing it!
He can't do it!

Okay, okay, thanks, man,
but, yeah, no,

19:19.942 --> 19:21.410
I-I got this, I got this.

I'm sorry, Brian, but this is

19:42.265 --> 19:43.932
what I was trying to tell you.

19:43.966 --> 19:47.102
I'm sorry, too, but I see now
that you were right.

19:47.135 --> 19:48.937
I'm just not sure
how this could work

19:48.971 --> 19:51.774
or-or how our relationship
could fit into your world.

19:51.807 --> 19:53.342
QUAGMIRE:
Hey, less talk!

19:53.376 --> 19:55.210
I guess this is good-bye.

19:55.244 --> 19:56.545
ELLIE:
I guess it is.

19:56.579 --> 19:58.614
I'll always remember you, Brian.

19:58.647 --> 20:00.583
And I'll always
remember you, Ellie.

20:00.616 --> 20:03.852
(grunting): I promise to name
one of the puppies after you.

20:03.886 --> 20:06.389
Let's just cross our fingers...
(panting)

20:06.422 --> 20:08.591
it's not one of the ones
he eats.

20:08.624 --> 20:10.025
Thanks. That means a lot...

20:10.058 --> 20:11.960
Okay, we're at the part
where he bites down

20:11.994 --> 20:14.530
on the back of my neck, so we
should probably wrap this up.

20:14.563 --> 20:15.764
Yup.

20:15.798 --> 20:19.034
Whoa! Max's grandfather
may have been a horse.

20:19.067 --> 20:20.569
Come on, let's just go home.

20:20.603 --> 20:22.137
Okay.

20:22.170 --> 20:25.140
Is this the romantic ending
you were hoping for?

20:25.173 --> 20:27.310
Look, that was a tricky
situation, all right?

20:27.343 --> 20:29.312
The lights,
the people watching.

20:29.345 --> 20:31.046
If-if it hadn't been
for all that, I...

20:31.079 --> 20:33.782
trust me, I-I would've, I
would've set her world on fire.

20:33.816 --> 20:35.584
No way.
You didn't even start the fire.

20:35.618 --> 20:36.752
Oh, no.
