01:10.880 --> 01:15.301
You see the way I gathered them cattle?
It was like a master class.

01:17.011 --> 01:19.889
Cows are probably like,
"Man, did you see the way he gathered us?

01:19.973 --> 01:21.432
And how ruggedly handsome he is?"

01:23.017 --> 01:26.145
"Yeah, and did you see how he slammed
his dad's hand in the tailgate?"

01:27.606 --> 01:29.733
I'd have told you
to rub some dirt on it, but...

01:30.441 --> 01:32.026
that's what you did.

01:34.696 --> 01:35.947
- Hey-o.
- Hey.

01:36.030 --> 01:38.157
- How was practice?
- Practice?

01:38.241 --> 01:41.995
What, are you pretending to be the girls'
high school volleyball coach again?

01:43.454 --> 01:45.414
No, man, they got wise to that.

01:45.498 --> 01:47.834
Defensive backs coach
for the football team.

01:47.917 --> 01:50.587
I get more 18-year-old cheerleaders now
than I did in high school.

01:52.589 --> 01:55.634
- I never figured you for a coach.
- Yeah, me neither.

01:55.717 --> 01:57.551
But Dad will only give me
time off for two things.

01:57.636 --> 01:59.846
- Funerals and football.
- Exactly.

01:59.929 --> 02:02.599
So, five years ago,
when the defensive backs coach died,

02:02.682 --> 02:03.892
I got both.

02:04.558 --> 02:07.270
- We got a team this year?
- Oh, hell yeah, we got a team.

02:07.353 --> 02:09.396
So, what's the deal?
We gonna beat Norwood or what?

02:09.479 --> 02:12.817
God, I hope so.
Can't stand Norwood.

02:12.901 --> 02:14.944
They act all high and mighty
with their Super Walmart

02:15.028 --> 02:16.445
and their second stop light.

02:17.989 --> 02:20.867
The John Deere store is in Norwood.

02:20.950 --> 02:24.746
Last year, some kid offered me
a loser's discount out of pity.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.082
I paid full price.

02:28.833 --> 02:31.460
Yo, I'm telling you guys,
we got a hell of a team.

02:31.544 --> 02:34.088
Quarterback... got an arm like a shotgun.

02:34.172 --> 02:35.423
Calling him the next Colt Bennett.

02:35.506 --> 02:39.052
Does that mean he's gonna be
livin' at home when he's 34 years old?

02:41.054 --> 02:43.181
"The next Colt Bennett." [scoffs]

02:43.264 --> 02:45.183
Yeah, they say that every year.

02:45.266 --> 02:47.601
There ain't never gonna be
another Colt Bennett.

02:47.686 --> 02:50.646
Remember that guy that came after me?
Was it Dubanowski?

02:50.730 --> 02:51.898
What's he doing now?

02:53.399 --> 02:54.442
He's a surgeon.

02:55.359 --> 02:57.111
He separated Siamese twins.

02:59.238 --> 03:01.032
So what? He separates shit.

03:02.325 --> 03:05.829
I brought a whole town together
and won State. All with this arm.

03:06.746 --> 03:09.207
Remember who you got that arm from.

03:09.290 --> 03:11.167
You got your mother's.

03:14.253 --> 03:15.922
I thought you were a linebacker, Dad.

03:16.005 --> 03:18.549
In my day, we did it all.
We played both ways.

03:18.632 --> 03:20.802
Yeah, that means something
different nowadays, Dad.

03:22.095 --> 03:23.179
All right, let's run a play.

03:23.262 --> 03:25.681
Dad, you hike me the ball.
Rooster, go long.

03:25.765 --> 03:27.767
- Hell no, man. I know that trick.
- What trick?

03:27.851 --> 03:29.936
The one where you tell me to go long,
then go longer,

03:30.019 --> 03:33.064
then you run inside, lock the door,
and dunk your balls in my Cheerios.

03:34.315 --> 03:35.316
It's dinner.

03:35.399 --> 03:38.194
I ain't gonna dunk my sack
in your hot soup.

03:38.945 --> 03:41.072
You only make that mistake once.

03:41.155 --> 03:43.742
What the hell's wrong with you two?

03:43.825 --> 03:47.078
I grew up with two brothers.
Never saw nut one.

03:48.121 --> 03:49.372
Rooster, go long.

03:49.455 --> 03:51.040
Let's go. All right. Here we go.

03:51.124 --> 03:52.375
Hut, hut!

03:52.458 --> 03:53.835
[groans]

03:55.003 --> 03:57.421
- You okay?
- Do I look like I'm okay?

03:59.007 --> 04:01.384
Well, you look like
you're about to play both ways.

04:08.307 --> 04:09.976
Couldn't just let me drive.

04:10.059 --> 04:11.770
- I'm fine.
- Yeah.

04:11.853 --> 04:14.856
Every time you made a right hand turn,
you sounded like a female tennis player.

04:15.899 --> 04:17.358
[grunts weakly]

04:21.112 --> 04:24.908
Beau, what's wrong? You're walking
like you have an actual stick up your ass.

04:26.284 --> 04:27.368
Threw his back out.

04:28.036 --> 04:30.579
You know what's good for a bad back?

04:30.663 --> 04:31.748
Pilates.

04:33.374 --> 04:34.793
Not helping, Hank.

04:34.876 --> 04:38.838
Excuse me for bringing
a little culture to this bar.

04:40.631 --> 04:43.676
- You know you have to see someone, right?
- I'm fine.

04:44.468 --> 04:47.138
You're fine? All right. Here, boys.

04:47.221 --> 04:48.222
Thanks, Mom.

04:49.182 --> 04:52.726
And, Beau, since your back is fine
and you don't need to go to the doctor,

04:52.811 --> 04:54.771
here's your beer.

04:56.522 --> 04:57.565
Pick it up.

04:59.233 --> 05:00.734
Go see a doctor.

05:00.819 --> 05:04.989
And fork over $200 for a co-pay?
No, thanks.

05:05.073 --> 05:08.534
If it ain't feeling better next week,
I'll go to the vet and get some pills.

05:10.411 --> 05:12.288
Rooster, will you pick up my beer?

05:12.371 --> 05:13.581
Yup.

05:13.664 --> 05:17.460
Jameson, you touch that beer,
you'll never drink in this bar again.

05:19.420 --> 05:20.754
Sorry, Dad.

05:23.466 --> 05:26.219
I love you,
but I love free beer more, so...

05:27.761 --> 05:29.138
Colt?

05:41.609 --> 05:42.944
What are you gonna do, chase me?

05:47.949 --> 05:49.575
Oh, my God.

05:49.658 --> 05:51.035
Kenny.

05:51.119 --> 05:54.788
Oh, man. You trying to avoid him
'cause he's banging your ex-girlfriend?

05:54.873 --> 05:57.666
- Yeah, big time.
- Yeah. I don't blame you.

05:57.750 --> 05:59.335
Hey, yo, Kenny, what's up, my man?

06:00.294 --> 06:02.505
Hey! Rooster! Colt!

06:02.588 --> 06:05.299
Yo, man. You buying meth again
from Shaggy over there?

06:06.384 --> 06:08.052
I had a feeling you might be here.

06:08.136 --> 06:10.721
You know, because it's your mom's,
not because you have a drinking problem.

06:13.391 --> 06:14.683
Two beers. That's cool.

06:16.727 --> 06:18.687
So, Kenny, how's things with you and Abby?

06:18.771 --> 06:22.733
They great? Because you guys
make a really, really cute couple.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.485
Yeah.

06:24.568 --> 06:25.861
- She's the best!
- Yeah.

06:25.945 --> 06:27.071
She just gets me.

06:27.155 --> 06:28.239
Yeah, that's great.

06:28.322 --> 06:30.283
Hey, you know what?
I think Dad wants to get out of here.

06:30.366 --> 06:32.701
No, I don't think he does.
[clears throat]

06:32.785 --> 06:36.330
Uh, so, you know, I know
all the reasons why Abby loves you,

06:36.414 --> 06:39.125
but why don't you tell me and Colt
all the reasons you love Abby.

06:39.208 --> 06:41.210
Uh, yeah, I mean...

06:42.128 --> 06:43.796
- She smells like vanilla.
- Whoo!

06:44.755 --> 06:45.839
You hear that, Colt?

06:46.549 --> 06:47.633
Vanilla!

06:49.468 --> 06:50.886
Hey, listen, I don't know if you heard,

06:50.970 --> 06:55.183
but I was recently elected president
of the Garrison football booster club,

06:55.266 --> 06:57.351
and we're kicking things off,
pun intended,

06:57.435 --> 06:59.770
with a, uh, spaghetti dinner.

06:59.853 --> 07:02.481
I was wondering if you'd come by
and maybe say a few words.

07:03.274 --> 07:04.525
No, thank you.

07:05.401 --> 07:06.986
Pun intended.

07:08.571 --> 07:12.283
Okay. Um... then maybe you could
donate something for our raffle?

07:12.366 --> 07:15.203
I'd love to get an autographed picture
of you and the new quarterback.

07:15.286 --> 07:17.246
Yeah, okay. I can do that.

07:17.330 --> 07:18.957
Hey, you know, if you want,

07:19.040 --> 07:22.126
I'll even do that, uh,
"Win a date with Colt Bennett" thing,

07:22.210 --> 07:24.295
as long as it's rigged
and I get to pick the winner.

07:26.172 --> 07:27.673
Yeah, man.

07:27.756 --> 07:29.383
No fatties. No flatties.

07:33.096 --> 07:35.723
Oh, okay.
Like I'm the only one thinking that.

07:37.141 --> 07:39.102
[country music playing]

08:20.434 --> 08:21.644
[music fades]

08:22.561 --> 08:23.687
Hello, Mr. Bennett.

08:24.230 --> 08:25.564
Where's Dr. Boyd?

08:26.649 --> 08:27.691
I'm Dr. Boyd.

08:27.775 --> 08:29.485
No, the real Dr. Boyd.

08:29.568 --> 08:31.737
Oh, you're thinking of my dad.

08:31.820 --> 08:33.030
When's the last time you saw him?

08:34.032 --> 08:35.573
Oh, I don't know.
A year or two, maybe.

08:35.658 --> 08:37.368
He died 12 years ago.

08:38.077 --> 08:39.870
Maybe it was longer.

08:41.080 --> 08:44.125
I took over his practice. But don't worry,
you're in good hands with me.

08:44.207 --> 08:47.295
So, how long has your back
been bothering you?

08:47.378 --> 08:48.754
None of your business.

08:49.797 --> 08:52.383
Oh! Beau Bennett!

08:52.466 --> 08:54.593
Okay, yeah! [chuckles]

08:54.677 --> 08:56.637
I'll tell you what, I'll examine your back

08:56.720 --> 08:59.140
and take a couple x-rays
and see what we're dealing with.

08:59.223 --> 09:00.724
And while you're here,
we'll do a quick checkup.

09:00.808 --> 09:03.644
I don't need a checkup.
Everything else is fine.

09:03.727 --> 09:06.105
You haven't been to the doctor
in 12 years.

09:06.189 --> 09:08.607
I wouldn't be doing my job
if I didn't give you an examination.

09:08.691 --> 09:11.360
On the plus side,
since I've become a doctor,

09:11.444 --> 09:13.362
I've only killed three patients.

09:14.572 --> 09:16.449
Oh, good. You're funny, too.

09:18.117 --> 09:19.368
Are we done here?

09:19.452 --> 09:20.994
How about this.

09:21.079 --> 09:22.955
I'll give you a prescription
for your back.

09:28.752 --> 09:30.713
Feel free to pick it up
and walk out of here anytime.

09:31.505 --> 09:33.091
But if you can't, then I'm doing an exam.

09:34.883 --> 09:36.510
You've been talkin' to my wife.

09:42.391 --> 09:44.477
Staring at your old trophies, huh?

09:44.560 --> 09:45.936
That's a little vain.

09:46.604 --> 09:49.857
- Actually, I was staring at my reflection.
- [laughs]

09:50.441 --> 09:51.817
So, what're you doing here?

09:51.900 --> 09:55.946
Uh, they asked me to come
take a picture with the new quarterback.

09:56.029 --> 09:58.866
- Oh.
- You got a couple hot teachers over there.

09:58.949 --> 10:00.659
Looks like someone's got some competition.

10:00.743 --> 10:03.079
Those are both students.

10:04.372 --> 10:06.290
Even better.

10:06.999 --> 10:08.959
All right. [chuckles]
I gotta get to my class.

10:09.042 --> 10:12.505
Oh, look at that!
Are you in Miss Henderson's old room?

10:12.588 --> 10:14.006
- [Abby] Yeah.
- Oh, man.

10:14.090 --> 10:15.341
You know, she was my favorite teacher.

10:15.424 --> 10:18.094
Of course. 'Cause instead of teaching us
about World War II,

10:18.177 --> 10:21.264
she just put on <i>Saving Private Ryan,</i>
sat at her desk,

10:21.347 --> 10:22.848
drank out of her "water bottle."

10:24.308 --> 10:27.228
I don't know who won World War II,
but I know we got Matt Damon back.

10:27.311 --> 10:28.771
[laughs]

10:28.854 --> 10:30.231
[school bell rings]

10:30.314 --> 10:32.400
Hey. You better get in there.

10:32.483 --> 10:34.735
You know, if the teacher's not in the room
in the first five minutes,

10:34.818 --> 10:36.069
the whole class gets to go home.

10:36.154 --> 10:38.572
Wasn't a thing then, not a thing now.

10:39.365 --> 10:41.659
Oh, and, uh, we beat the Germans.

10:41.742 --> 10:44.870
[scoffs] Yeah, nice try.
I know that was World War I.

10:49.125 --> 10:50.626
- Hey, Colt.
- Hey.

10:50.709 --> 10:52.253
Check out these new teachers?

10:52.336 --> 10:53.462
Actually, they're students.

10:53.546 --> 10:55.131
Whoa.

10:55.214 --> 10:56.507
Thanks for the heads-up.

10:58.467 --> 10:59.718
You think they're seniors?

11:00.803 --> 11:02.388
Here he is.

11:02.471 --> 11:04.723
Bennett. Long time no see.

11:04.807 --> 11:06.142
Hey, Coach Fitz.

11:06.225 --> 11:08.602
Have you met Josh? He's gonna take us
to our next State Championship.

11:08.686 --> 11:10.563
- Hey. Nice to meet you, bud.
- You, too.

11:10.646 --> 11:12.356
You're the reason
I started playing football, sir.

11:12.440 --> 11:13.816
[chuckles] "Sir"?

11:13.899 --> 11:16.026
Come on, save "sir"
for when you meet your girlfriend's dad

11:16.109 --> 11:18.321
or you're getting pulled over
for your first DUI.

11:18.404 --> 11:19.738
Good advice, Colt.

11:19.822 --> 11:21.365
[clicks tongue]

11:21.449 --> 11:23.326
You know, my dad taped over
my first birthday party

11:23.409 --> 11:26.119
- to record your State Championship game.
- Oh.

11:26.204 --> 11:28.206
You remember that last play?

11:28.289 --> 11:29.748
Nah, not really.

11:29.832 --> 11:33.043
Seven seconds left.
Down by three.

11:33.126 --> 11:36.004
On the other team's 20.
I'm staring at a cover two defense.

11:36.088 --> 11:40.050
This hot chick in the second row
just going to town on a corn dog.

11:41.719 --> 11:44.263
This guy... [chuckles]
wants me to play it safe.

11:44.347 --> 11:46.765
Get a few yards, so he can
put the kicker in and tie the game.

11:46.849 --> 11:49.101
- [chuckles]
- So I audible to a pass, right?

11:49.184 --> 11:53.606
I take the snap, I drop back,
and my primary receiver falls down.

11:53.689 --> 11:55.733
Okay? So I roll out to the right.

11:55.816 --> 11:58.026
Their all-state linebacker's
coming down on me, right?

11:58.110 --> 11:59.111
I know this guy.

11:59.194 --> 12:01.029
He wants to rip my head off
'cause I banged his sister.

12:02.281 --> 12:04.617
Wilson was wide open in the end zone.

12:04.700 --> 12:06.744
[chuckles] Like I'm gonna
throw the ball to Wilson.

12:06.827 --> 12:09.037
The only thing he caught
that season was crabs.

12:09.121 --> 12:10.914
Linebacker's sister.
I got 'em, too.

12:12.333 --> 12:14.377
She got 'em from me.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.880
So I hurdle for the end zone,
ball outstretched.

12:17.963 --> 12:20.466
Zebra puts his arms up.
Game over.

12:20.549 --> 12:22.343
State Championship. Boom!

12:23.427 --> 12:24.720
Aaron Rodgers stole that from me.

12:26.305 --> 12:28.557
Discount double check my ass.

12:29.767 --> 12:31.519
It was a great day for the whole town.

12:31.602 --> 12:34.062
I puked on a cop car...
[chuckles] and no one even cared.

12:36.106 --> 12:37.525
Hey, you know, if you want,

12:38.609 --> 12:39.902
I could come down and help you out a bit.

12:40.986 --> 12:42.905
- What do you say, Coach?
- Sounds great.

12:44.156 --> 12:45.908
You gotta tell that story
at the spaghetti dinner.

12:48.827 --> 12:51.246
Yeah, I think I could come down
and say a few words.

12:51.330 --> 12:53.374
Sweet! The guys will be stoked.

12:54.583 --> 12:55.751
You really were the best.

12:56.419 --> 12:57.920
Aw... yeah.

13:00.589 --> 13:02.007
Well, Mr. Bennett...

13:03.301 --> 13:05.177
I have to say, for the most part,

13:05.260 --> 13:07.012
you're in impressive health
for a man your age.

13:07.095 --> 13:10.599
You know, when I take my truck in
and there's nothing wrong with it,

13:10.683 --> 13:12.184
they don't charge me.

13:14.144 --> 13:18.065
Take these until your back pain subsides,
and, um, you should be fine in a few days.

13:18.857 --> 13:21.777
Sounds good.
I'll see you in 12 years.

13:21.860 --> 13:23.946
I'm not done.

13:24.029 --> 13:25.573
We have to talk about
your high blood pressure.

13:25.656 --> 13:26.907
What?

13:26.990 --> 13:29.743
You're at risk for stage two hypertension,

13:29.827 --> 13:32.663
which could lead to heart attack,
stroke or kidney failure.

13:32.746 --> 13:34.457
Unless you make some lifestyle changes.

13:34.540 --> 13:36.334
I'm not doing Pilates.

13:37.751 --> 13:41.004
I think we can start with your diet.
I'd like you to cut back on red meat.

13:41.088 --> 13:42.089
Pass.

13:42.172 --> 13:44.132
You're also going to have
to cut down on your drinking.

13:44.216 --> 13:45.551
Try again.

13:46.344 --> 13:48.220
What about stress?
What do you do to reduce it?

13:48.303 --> 13:50.222
Eat steak and drink whiskey.

13:51.849 --> 13:53.809
Mr. Bennett, come on, this is serious.

13:55.143 --> 13:57.813
My stress will come down
when I sell my calves.

13:57.896 --> 14:00.065
Well, in the meantime,
you need to cut back on salt

14:00.148 --> 14:01.359
and eat more vegetables.

14:02.317 --> 14:03.986
Okay, I think we're done here.

14:08.407 --> 14:11.785
Yeah. If I had receivers like you,
I'd have won four State Championships.

14:11.869 --> 14:13.704
Drop it. All right.

14:13.787 --> 14:16.206
Now give me five yards and a slant.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.334
That's 35 in dog yards.

14:18.417 --> 14:20.210
Hut. Hut. Hike.

14:22.546 --> 14:23.714
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:23.797 --> 14:24.798
How was practice?

14:25.466 --> 14:27.468
We ran corner blitzes,

14:27.551 --> 14:30.554
I confiscated one kid's pot,
sold it to another kid.

14:31.304 --> 14:33.682
Overall, a pretty good day.

14:33.766 --> 14:34.975
Yeah.

14:35.058 --> 14:38.812
Hey, you know what?
That Josh seems like a pretty good kid.

14:38.896 --> 14:39.938
I think I can really help him.

14:40.022 --> 14:41.649
Yeah, about that.

14:41.732 --> 14:44.151
I'm not sure the coach wants you
hanging around the team.

14:44.234 --> 14:45.778
Why would you say that?

14:45.861 --> 14:48.321
Because the coach told me, "I don't want
Colt hanging around the team."

14:49.281 --> 14:50.449
Why not?

14:50.533 --> 14:52.951
Well, he said you have
a disrespectful attitude.

14:53.035 --> 14:55.120
Fuck that asshole.

14:55.203 --> 14:57.122
Clearly, he's out of his mind.

14:57.205 --> 14:59.417
I won that guy his only State title.

14:59.500 --> 15:02.169
Colt, you came in there
and told a five-minute story,

15:02.252 --> 15:05.047
and the moral was, "Don't listen to Coach
and you win a State Championship."

15:05.839 --> 15:07.215
What kind of message
does that send to the team?

15:07.299 --> 15:11.053
One that ends with,
"You win a State Championship."

15:11.136 --> 15:14.222
You know what?
It's fine. It's Coach's loss.

15:14.306 --> 15:15.849
Team's loss. Town's loss.

15:17.142 --> 15:19.437
- I'm sorry.
- Don't feel sorry for me.

15:19.520 --> 15:20.604
Feel sorry for the coach.

15:20.688 --> 15:22.815
And the team.
And the town.

15:23.857 --> 15:26.694
You're being a baby.
And a tool.

15:26.777 --> 15:27.861
And a douche.

15:32.866 --> 15:34.993
Well, Maggie, I hope you're happy.

15:35.994 --> 15:36.995
I am.

15:37.955 --> 15:39.832
How are you gonna ruin it?

15:40.708 --> 15:42.668
You gave me high blood pressure.

15:44.169 --> 15:47.005
- What?
- I went to the doctor, like you said.

15:47.089 --> 15:49.633
Now I have high blood pressure.

15:49.717 --> 15:54.262
High blood pressure is manageable.
You know, it's not the end of the world.

15:54.346 --> 15:56.932
I'm prepared for the end of the world.

15:57.015 --> 15:59.101
I've got a shelter full of beef jerky.

16:00.561 --> 16:03.731
Yeah, I know. You took me there
for our 20th anniversary.

16:05.148 --> 16:07.234
Look, all you have to do
is take more walks,

16:07.317 --> 16:10.320
drink more water,
and switch from bacon to turkey bacon.

16:10.403 --> 16:13.824
Yeah, and I'll trade my truck
in on a Prius.

16:14.783 --> 16:16.952
If it'll help, I'll diet with you.
How's that?

16:17.035 --> 16:23.000
Why can't you just be like a normal wife
and not care if I live or die?

16:24.627 --> 16:26.378
Don't worry about it.
You stay healthy,

16:26.462 --> 16:28.464
you're looking at another 30 years

16:28.547 --> 16:31.424
of wakin' up at dawn
and workin' that ranch with your sons.

16:31.509 --> 16:33.761
Sweet Jesus, take me now.

16:41.894 --> 16:43.937
- Hey, Colt.
- Hey.

16:44.563 --> 16:46.607
Abby. What are you doing here?

16:46.690 --> 16:49.860
Well, I thought you might wanna
wear this to the spaghetti dinner.

16:51.570 --> 16:54.406
- What is that? My old letterman jacket?
- Yeah.

16:54.490 --> 16:55.741
You still got it, huh?

16:56.366 --> 16:59.036
Yeah, you know, I thought maybe,
you know, after we broke up,

16:59.119 --> 17:02.831
you'd become famous
and I could sell it for a lot of money.

17:02.915 --> 17:05.208
Anyway, here.

17:07.586 --> 17:09.588
- Look at that.
- [chuckles] Nice.

17:09.672 --> 17:11.089
- Wow!
- [laughs]

17:14.134 --> 17:15.761
Do I look as good as I think I do?

17:17.429 --> 17:19.013
Don't think that's possible.

17:21.642 --> 17:23.018
I heard about the coaching thing.

17:23.101 --> 17:26.021
Oh, yeah.
It's not a big deal.

17:26.939 --> 17:28.356
I was just offering a favor.

17:28.440 --> 17:30.693
I mean, heck, if Blake Shelton
wants to teach you how to sing,

17:30.776 --> 17:33.779
you don't go with Shakira, right?

17:33.862 --> 17:36.824
Well, for what it's worth, Coach is crazy.

17:36.907 --> 17:40.243
I mean, who knows more about getting
Garrison to State than Colt Bennett?

17:41.328 --> 17:44.372
I guess you haven't heard
about the new Colt Bennett.

17:44.456 --> 17:47.042
You know, I'm driving. [chuckles]

17:47.125 --> 17:51.129
Yeah, I have. Josh, you know,
he's just another read-option clone.

17:51.213 --> 17:52.965
I mean, he can hit the short crosses

17:53.048 --> 17:55.425
and extend plays with his feet,
but he stares down his primary receiver

17:55.508 --> 17:57.970
and that is just begging
to be intercepted.

17:58.596 --> 18:01.389
Okay, now I'm offended
they didn't ask you to be the new coach.

18:01.932 --> 18:04.267
Well, actually, they did.

18:04.351 --> 18:06.394
I just had a full class schedule.

18:06.478 --> 18:09.732
- That's why they hired Rooster. Shh.
- [chuckles]

18:11.859 --> 18:13.193
You miss football, don't you?

18:14.486 --> 18:16.113
Ah... [scoffs]

18:16.196 --> 18:19.032
No. What do I miss?
Two-a-days, and the ice baths, and...

18:20.576 --> 18:23.245
however many concussions I had.

18:25.330 --> 18:26.957
Actually, I don't miss it at all.

18:28.041 --> 18:29.877
You'd be a lot more convincing
if you weren't sitting there

18:29.960 --> 18:31.837
holding a football and wearing
a letterman jacket.

18:33.046 --> 18:34.089
[chuckles]

18:34.172 --> 18:36.383
But I'm sure it must be hard.

18:39.177 --> 18:41.554
I don't even know why
I came back to this stupid town.

18:42.097 --> 18:44.808
What? I'm glad you came back.

18:44.892 --> 18:47.019
I mean, as bad as you think
this place is with you,

18:47.102 --> 18:48.771
it's even worse without you.

18:50.898 --> 18:52.440
You're about the best thing here.

18:53.400 --> 18:56.028
There you go.
You found something good.

18:57.863 --> 18:59.364
Yeah, I did.

18:59.447 --> 19:02.117
Whoa, Colt. What are you doing? No.

19:02.200 --> 19:03.744
What?

19:03.827 --> 19:05.328
I have a boyfriend.

19:05.412 --> 19:06.955
Who? Kenny?

19:07.039 --> 19:08.666
Yeah, Kenny.

19:09.667 --> 19:12.044
He's a good guy and I love him.

19:12.127 --> 19:13.295
[sighs]

19:13.378 --> 19:16.048
Okay, then why do you keep
making excuses to come out here?

19:16.131 --> 19:17.925
You know what? Forget it.

19:18.008 --> 19:21.386
I was just trying to be your friend,
but don't worry,

19:21.469 --> 19:22.554
that won't happen again.

19:41.073 --> 19:42.532
[glass shatters]

19:45.285 --> 19:46.286
[loud thud]

19:47.871 --> 19:49.497
[indistinct chatter]

19:50.415 --> 19:52.375
Here you go.

19:52.459 --> 19:55.253
- What the hell is this?
- Your dinner.

19:56.379 --> 19:58.340
This is not my dinner.

19:58.423 --> 20:00.133
This is what I feed my dinner.

20:01.802 --> 20:03.386
I gotta capture this moment.

20:03.470 --> 20:06.014
It's like if you got a shot of Bigfoot
coming out of the woods.

20:06.514 --> 20:07.808
And he was eating a salad.

20:10.769 --> 20:12.395
[shutter clicks]

20:12.479 --> 20:13.689
Hey, everybody.

20:13.772 --> 20:15.648
Now, before I bring out Coach Fitzgerald,

20:15.733 --> 20:18.318
how about we give away
our first raffle prize?

20:18.401 --> 20:20.946
A free night's stay
at any Courtyard by Marriott.

20:21.029 --> 20:22.781
- [cheering]
- [boy] Yeah.

20:23.949 --> 20:26.952
That's nice.
Who donated that? [chuckles]

20:27.577 --> 20:29.121
[chuckling] All right.

20:30.163 --> 20:32.207
And the winner is...

20:32.290 --> 20:33.375
Maggie Bennett!

20:33.458 --> 20:35.127
Oh, my God!

20:35.210 --> 20:37.170
Good for you.
Go get your prize.

20:39.006 --> 20:40.340
[Maggie] Oh!

20:43.593 --> 20:45.387
What do you want for that meatball?

20:47.014 --> 20:48.348
I don't shovel shit for a week.

20:48.431 --> 20:49.432
Done.

20:50.642 --> 20:52.352
I'd have given you a month.

20:53.353 --> 20:55.731
And now, a big surprise for everyone.

20:55.814 --> 20:59.276
The greatest quarterback
in Garrison High School history,

20:59.359 --> 21:00.527
Colt Bennett!

21:00.610 --> 21:02.529
- [cheering]
- [applause]

21:02.612 --> 21:04.364
[chanting] Colt!

21:07.075 --> 21:08.076
Thank you.

21:09.077 --> 21:10.412
Let me ask you a question.

21:11.454 --> 21:14.833
Who's the best high school football team
in the state of Colorado?

21:14.917 --> 21:16.418
[all] Garrison!

21:16.501 --> 21:19.963
And who's gonna kick
Norwood's ass this week?

21:20.047 --> 21:21.339
[all] Garrison!

21:21.423 --> 21:23.716
Who's going all the way to State?

21:23.801 --> 21:25.093
[all] Garrison!

21:25.177 --> 21:26.929
Who's going to finish the season

21:27.012 --> 21:29.347
and realize their best years
are behind them?

21:29.431 --> 21:31.516
[scattered] Garrison...

21:31.599 --> 21:32.851
Is he drunk?

21:32.935 --> 21:34.061
No more than usual.

21:35.603 --> 21:40.358
And who's gonna wash up
as a professional football player...

21:41.359 --> 21:43.278
and then have
to move back home with his dad,

21:43.361 --> 21:46.114
and then find out that his girlfriend

21:46.198 --> 21:48.616
is dating someone from the band?

21:50.493 --> 21:52.579
Garrison!

21:55.040 --> 21:57.000
[feedback crackles]

21:57.084 --> 21:59.127
- [chuckles]
- [people murmuring]

[exhales heavily]

22:14.184 --> 22:15.185
Hey.

[slurring] I can explain everything, sir.

22:56.726 --> 22:59.729
I was not speeding.

22:59.812 --> 23:03.775
You know what? I want a lawyer.
She said she was 18.

23:03.858 --> 23:05.903
Bennett? Is that you?

23:07.654 --> 23:10.032
Beer Pong Billy!
[laughing]

23:12.825 --> 23:14.119
Hey!

23:14.202 --> 23:16.371
Oh, my God!

23:16.454 --> 23:17.789
Man!

23:18.581 --> 23:19.791
What've you been up to?

23:19.874 --> 23:22.710
Well, you know, I applied to college.

23:22.794 --> 23:23.921
Didn't get in.

23:24.004 --> 23:26.089
Applied to a few fast food restaurants.

23:26.173 --> 23:27.215
Didn't get in there either.

23:27.299 --> 23:28.967
So now I'm a cop.

23:30.135 --> 23:31.469
Oh!

23:31.553 --> 23:33.513
That's awesome.
Hey...

23:33.596 --> 23:35.974
what're you doing all the way out here?

23:36.058 --> 23:38.060
Pulling over a drunk guy
driving a tractor.

23:39.186 --> 23:41.146
That's amazing, 'cause...

23:41.229 --> 23:43.898
I'm, like, maybe,
like, a little bit drunk,

23:43.982 --> 23:45.358
and I'm driving a tractor,

23:45.442 --> 23:47.652
and I just got pulled over by a cop.

23:48.653 --> 23:50.238
It's like we're doing the same thing.

23:51.364 --> 23:53.658
Hey, hey, I got an idea.

23:53.741 --> 23:54.742
Let's run a play!

23:54.826 --> 23:58.580
How about we just get in the back
of my cop car and try not to throw up.

23:58.663 --> 24:02.250
Yeah, we'll get to that.
But first, let's do my idea.

24:02.334 --> 24:03.543
- Bennett!
- Omaha!

24:03.626 --> 24:05.295
Hey! Hey, dude, stop!

24:05.378 --> 24:08.215
Colt! Come on, dude!
My car has got a camera on it.

24:08.298 --> 24:10.342
You're gonna make me look like an idiot!

24:10.425 --> 24:14.012
[laughing] Hey! Hey!
Remember in high school

24:14.096 --> 24:16.264
when we were at, um, what...

24:16.348 --> 24:19.517
Amy Plummer's house,
and you took a dump in her dryer?

24:19.601 --> 24:22.937
And then we just went back
to playing <i>Uno</i> like nothing ever happened?

24:23.813 --> 24:26.358
It was her washer, man.
I'm not an animal.

24:26.441 --> 24:28.693
Oh, man, you're a legend!

24:28.776 --> 24:30.945
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- Me?

24:32.114 --> 24:33.991
I peaked in high school.

24:35.158 --> 24:37.952
Yeah, well, it seems like you're doing
just great. Come on. Get in the car.

24:38.036 --> 24:39.162
Oh, come on!

24:39.246 --> 24:41.498
You're arresting me
for sticking my hands in your butt?

24:41.581 --> 24:44.126
Man, I'm not arresting you.
I'm just gonna get you home.

24:44.209 --> 24:45.710
- Come on.
- Really?

24:46.336 --> 24:47.879
You're a good guy, Beer Pong.

24:52.717 --> 24:55.053
- What is this? A Glock?
- Gimme that!

24:58.556 --> 25:02.060
Say what you want,
those kids are gonna remember that speech.

25:04.437 --> 25:06.564
We need to sit and talk with him.

25:06.648 --> 25:09.859
Well, I'm at a loss.
I've tried everything.

25:09.942 --> 25:12.570
You've tried yelling at him
and kicking him out.

25:12.654 --> 25:15.282
Like I said, I've tried everything.

25:17.867 --> 25:19.036
Here comes Beer Pong.

25:19.119 --> 25:22.289
Well, if someone had to find him,
I'm glad it was Billy.

25:22.997 --> 25:24.374
[sighs]

25:26.000 --> 25:27.169
[exhales deeply]

25:27.252 --> 25:29.087
What's up, Beer Pong?
You got that 50 bucks you owe me?

25:30.422 --> 25:33.675
You still sellin' weed
to high school kids, Rooster?

25:33.758 --> 25:35.302
All right. Even Stevens.

25:38.888 --> 25:41.683
I'm serious.
I can beat my high score.

25:41.766 --> 25:44.686
It's not a video game, Bennett.
It's a breathalyzer.

25:45.895 --> 25:49.066
[imitating Billy] "It's not a video game,
Bennett. It's a breathalyzer."

25:49.149 --> 25:51.818
You used to be so chill, Beer Pong.

25:51.901 --> 25:52.985
Thank you, Billy.

25:53.070 --> 25:56.281
Picked him up on Route 68.
That's where you'll find your tractor.

25:56.364 --> 25:58.491
Our tractor's in the barn.

26:00.827 --> 26:01.828
Damn it.

26:04.289 --> 26:05.665
Shh!

26:05.748 --> 26:06.749
What's up?

26:08.626 --> 26:10.878
- I stole Billy's Taser.
- [both laugh]

26:12.755 --> 26:14.549
Not funny, dude.

26:14.632 --> 26:17.051
If I lose another one of these,
I'm off the force.

26:18.970 --> 26:22.682
- Colt, sit, we need to talk.
- [slurring] Mom, I don't wanna hear it.

26:22.765 --> 26:24.726
I already know
what everyone is gonna say.

26:25.602 --> 26:28.938
[imitating Maggie] Colt,
I'm worried about you.

26:30.315 --> 26:33.193
[imitating Beau] Colt, I'm mad at you.

26:34.652 --> 26:37.489
[imitating Rooster]
Colt, blah, blah, blah...

26:38.990 --> 26:40.325
Something sarcastic.

26:42.285 --> 26:43.870
The last one was you.

26:45.372 --> 26:46.456
Blah, blah, blah.

26:46.539 --> 26:47.957
[retches]

26:50.460 --> 26:51.753
That's you in about two minutes.

26:51.836 --> 26:52.962
[chuckles]

26:53.045 --> 26:55.089
Yeah. Colt Bennett doesn't...

26:55.173 --> 26:56.174
[retches]

27:22.659 --> 27:24.411
Morning.

27:24.494 --> 27:26.246
Damn it. [clears throat]

27:29.999 --> 27:31.083
All right.

27:32.001 --> 27:33.295
You're pissed.

27:34.504 --> 27:35.797
I'm sorry.

27:36.714 --> 27:39.634
I just made an idiot out of myself.

27:39.717 --> 27:42.762
I embarrassed you,
and I embarrassed our family.

27:42.845 --> 27:46.933
You also drove the Millers' tractor
through the Dairy Queen drive-thru.

27:50.770 --> 27:52.564
All right. You know what?

27:52.647 --> 27:54.566
You're gonna yell at me,

27:54.649 --> 27:57.151
so why don't we just go ahead
and get that over with.

27:57.235 --> 27:59.654
That hasn't done much good so far.

28:00.488 --> 28:02.156
What?

28:03.157 --> 28:05.785
You know, when I got back from Vietnam,

28:05.868 --> 28:08.538
I had absolutely no idea
what I was gonna do.

28:10.623 --> 28:12.166
Twenty-two years old.

28:13.293 --> 28:15.670
I was a soldier.
It was all I knew.

28:17.380 --> 28:19.591
Lost boy come home from the war.

28:21.092 --> 28:24.011
Only thing I had was right here.

28:24.095 --> 28:25.680
So I came back home.

28:29.767 --> 28:32.687
Grandpa bitch at you
for living at home, too?

28:35.982 --> 28:37.359
No, I don't think he did.

28:38.818 --> 28:41.321
He was just glad to have another hand.

28:41.404 --> 28:42.905
One he didn't have to pay.

28:44.824 --> 28:47.285
We were all just thankful
I came home in one piece.

28:50.205 --> 28:52.415
Wasn't long after that
grandfather died.

28:53.666 --> 28:55.335
Momma was all alone.

28:57.169 --> 28:58.505
Outta nowhere.

29:02.217 --> 29:04.552
But the work didn't die with him.

29:06.388 --> 29:08.931
And I knew right there who I was.

29:11.601 --> 29:12.935
I was a rancher.

29:14.396 --> 29:16.273
And for me, that was just right.

29:21.736 --> 29:24.364
I ain't sure
that ranching is just right for me.

29:27.909 --> 29:31.663
You know, Colt, I'm not smart enough
to tell you how to live your life.

29:34.957 --> 29:36.584
That's for you to figure out.

29:38.210 --> 29:40.129
But I do believe that one of these days

29:40.212 --> 29:43.341
you're gonna wake up
and know exactly who you are.

29:45.468 --> 29:48.220
I just hope I live long enough
to see that.

29:50.973 --> 29:52.517
In the meantime...

29:53.518 --> 29:55.812
you got a place you belong

29:55.895 --> 29:57.855
and work you can take pride in.

30:02.527 --> 30:03.736
Appreciate that.

30:07.699 --> 30:08.950
Or...

30:09.992 --> 30:13.746
you wake up one day
and find yourself eating quinoa.

30:18.501 --> 30:20.962
Whatever in the fuck that is.
