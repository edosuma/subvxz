00:14.414 --> 00:16.416
Yeah. Henry?

00:18.818 --> 00:20.420
We gotta go.

00:32.832 --> 00:34.434
Brennan.

01:36.896 --> 01:38.498
Keep going.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.301
What are they doing?

01:41.336 --> 01:42.502
I don't know.

01:42.902 --> 01:44.104
Why are
they turning back?

01:44.504 --> 01:45.670
I'll find out.

01:45.705 --> 01:47.307
Catch up with you later. Go.

01:52.512 --> 01:54.114
How long has
the gsa been on to you.

01:54.149 --> 01:55.680
Four, maybe five weeks.

01:55.715 --> 01:57.717
Why'd you wait
so long to contact us?

01:57.752 --> 01:59.719
Thought i could
handle them, but...

01:59.754 --> 02:01.721
they're
very persistent.

02:02.922 --> 02:04.924
Yeah, well, usually, but they
fell back pretty fast today.

02:04.959 --> 02:06.926
Maybe they're
afraid of ferals.

02:06.961 --> 02:09.294
Where we headed?

02:09.329 --> 02:12.132
Well, first
to a safehouse, then an
escort's going to take

02:12.167 --> 02:13.733
you into the underground.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.735
Is that where
brennan's meeting us?

02:16.136 --> 02:19.339
I don't remember brennan
telling you his name.

02:32.952 --> 02:35.354
Agh...

02:35.389 --> 02:37.774
oh, ow.

02:37.809 --> 02:40.185
Agh.

02:40.220 --> 02:42.192
Ugh.

02:42.227 --> 02:44.164
Oh.

02:52.972 --> 02:54.174
You okay?

02:54.574 --> 02:55.340
Yeah.

02:55.375 --> 02:56.976
What happened?

03:00.580 --> 03:02.147
<panting>
where'd he go?

03:02.182 --> 03:03.783
I don't know,
but we'll find him.

03:03.818 --> 03:04.984
Come on.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.047
I made a mistake.

04:09.082 --> 04:12.285
Should have figured henry
was with the gsa the way

04:12.320 --> 04:13.886
they fell back like that.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.053
Alright, lay still.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.454
Let me finish
the diagnostics.

04:17.490 --> 04:19.091
And i should have
gotten out of there faster.

04:19.492 --> 04:21.494
You said henry pressed
his hand against your head?

04:21.529 --> 04:23.061
Yeah.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.297
He's a psionic.

04:24.332 --> 04:26.116
He was reading me.

04:26.151 --> 04:27.900
The way you used to.

04:30.303 --> 04:31.904
So what did it feel like?

04:31.939 --> 04:34.124
Like a violation.

04:34.159 --> 04:36.274
It was so weird.

04:36.309 --> 04:37.910
I could feel
the heat from his hand,

04:38.311 --> 04:40.713
and it was like he was
with me inside my head.

04:40.748 --> 04:43.081
Uh huh.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.518
Do you remember thinking
or feeling anything specific

04:45.553 --> 04:47.120
when he was trying to read you?

04:47.155 --> 04:48.286
No.

04:48.321 --> 04:49.522
I was numb.

04:49.922 --> 04:51.924
I don't remember anything.

04:55.928 --> 04:57.095
That eye scan.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.932
Well, there's no obvious
physiological damage.

05:00.333 --> 05:01.934
Told you so.

05:02.335 --> 05:03.936
Yeah. But i want
you to take it easy.

05:04.337 --> 05:05.538
Well, i'm a little tired.

05:05.938 --> 05:07.540
I'm going to take a nap.

05:10.343 --> 05:12.310
So what do you think?

05:12.345 --> 05:14.747
I think we need a full
profile on this henry.

05:15.148 --> 05:19.552
And emma, keep
a close eye on her.

05:38.771 --> 05:40.738
Feral's in my control.

05:40.773 --> 05:47.145
Now i'll be able to reel
them all in, one by one.

05:47.180 --> 05:52.185
I'm concerned,
henry, that you're
more interested in torturing

05:52.220 --> 05:57.190
them and less
interested in giving me
the information i need.

05:57.225 --> 05:59.192
You'll get what you want.

06:12.405 --> 06:15.608
Have you ever considered
renting an apartment?

06:15.643 --> 06:17.975
I like it here.

06:18.010 --> 06:24.016
Well, i suppose you've made
it your own - so to speak.

06:30.823 --> 06:34.026
Instruct miss fox to give us
the location of sanctuary and

06:34.061 --> 06:37.230
any pertinent information about
the new mutant underground.

06:38.831 --> 06:40.798
Ahem.

06:40.833 --> 06:43.636
And keep in touch.

07:30.483 --> 07:32.485
Hey, how's shalimar?

07:32.520 --> 07:34.452
Sound asleep.

07:34.487 --> 07:36.088
What have you got?

07:36.123 --> 07:37.690
File's incomplete.

07:38.090 --> 07:39.291
We know he's a psionic.

07:39.326 --> 07:40.493
No current address.

07:40.528 --> 07:41.711
Any relatives?

07:41.746 --> 07:42.860
Parents both dead.

07:42.895 --> 07:44.897
His dad worked
for fedrail, they
lived in the city their

07:44.932 --> 07:47.300
whole lives, blah, blah... blah?

07:47.335 --> 07:50.468
He's married.

07:50.503 --> 07:53.305
Brianna doolan voight.

07:53.340 --> 07:56.108
She works for the gsa.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.075
Yeah.

07:58.110 --> 08:00.513
She's on the payroll
for a year and a half.

08:00.913 --> 08:03.316
She died in action
nine months ago.

08:03.716 --> 08:06.519
So she dies and henry
just takes over for her?

08:06.554 --> 08:08.085
Well, stranger
things have happened.

08:08.120 --> 08:12.124
But, adam's got a dna sample
of henry off of shalimar,

08:12.159 --> 08:14.527
so, one way or
another, we'll get him.

09:18.591 --> 09:20.192
What are you doing, shal?

09:20.227 --> 09:21.759
Go back to bed, emma.

09:21.794 --> 09:23.396
You're neutralising
the alarms.

09:23.431 --> 09:24.562
Just running a test.

09:24.597 --> 09:26.999
On an open channel
that anybody could pick up.

09:27.034 --> 09:30.603
This is none
of your business, emma.

09:30.638 --> 09:33.806
What's that
on your head?

09:43.416 --> 09:45.383
Shalimar, stop it!

09:45.418 --> 09:48.621
You're
kidding, right?

10:33.466 --> 10:35.868
How the hell
d'you get in here?

10:49.081 --> 10:51.849
Shal'. You do this?

10:51.884 --> 10:53.486
Did henry make you do this, huh?

10:53.521 --> 10:56.253
What is henry controlling?

10:56.288 --> 10:58.290
I thought you
were stronger than...

10:58.325 --> 10:59.892
agh.

11:08.300 --> 11:09.902
Stop him.

11:34.326 --> 11:36.729
Lucky for you
they didn't get more.

11:44.737 --> 11:46.303
They'll never forgive you.

11:46.338 --> 11:51.944
Nothing will change
what you've done.

11:51.979 --> 11:55.147
That's not true.

11:59.151 --> 12:01.153
I'll kill them if you
don't let them all go.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.956
You're not the one
controlling the situation.

12:03.991 --> 12:07.159
Henry is.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.161
Agh.

12:11.964 --> 12:17.134
<panting>
nobody controls me.

12:17.169 --> 12:21.173
What do you think
we've been doing?

12:21.208 --> 12:22.775
You don't
have a chance.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.215
Get her.

13:16.829 --> 13:21.233
<screaming>

13:25.237 --> 13:26.839
stop struggling.

13:27.239 --> 13:29.441
It's over now.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.644
For all of you.

13:42.788 --> 13:47.993
<crying, coughing>

13:48.394 --> 13:49.195
shai... shal, you okay?

13:49.230 --> 13:50.761
Adam, come here.

13:50.796 --> 13:52.197
See that mark right there?

13:52.232 --> 13:53.599
That's where henry connected.

13:53.999 --> 13:55.201
Let's get her into the lab.

14:01.207 --> 14:02.408
What happened?

14:02.443 --> 14:03.574
She's in a coma.

14:03.609 --> 14:04.810
Henry's doing this to her.

14:05.211 --> 14:06.377
But how?

14:06.412 --> 14:08.414
He must have
got in control of her
through her subconscious

14:08.814 --> 14:10.381
when she fell asleep.

14:10.416 --> 14:13.219
So what's happening in her mind
is actually affecting her body?

14:13.254 --> 14:16.021
Uh huh, he made her believe
that he was choking her.

14:16.056 --> 14:18.424
Let me see if
i can connect to her.

14:18.459 --> 14:19.590
Oh, no, no.

14:19.625 --> 14:21.227
Because we don't
know what he's capable of.

14:21.627 --> 14:22.828
He might be able to
gain control of you this way.

14:23.229 --> 14:26.031
No, right now,
she's on her own.

14:35.641 --> 14:38.008
You're very
resourceful, miss fox.

14:38.043 --> 14:44.049
But there's
nothing you can do now
that will change the facts.

14:44.084 --> 14:48.018
One,
you led us to sanctuary.

14:48.053 --> 14:50.055
Henry, of course,
was the one guiding your hand,

14:50.090 --> 14:54.425
but it was still your hand.

14:54.460 --> 14:59.665
Two, i have
all of your mutant x
teammates in my custody.

14:59.700 --> 15:06.071
Now, here's the deal
i'm willing to offer.

15:06.106 --> 15:09.640
I'm not
interested in any deals.

15:09.675 --> 15:14.480
Have you completely lost
touch with your feral need to

15:14.515 --> 15:17.283
protect the pack?

15:17.683 --> 15:20.451
You don't know
anything about me.

15:20.486 --> 15:28.894
Psionic teammate doesn't
seem to have much left in her.

15:29.295 --> 15:34.900
What are you talking about?

15:44.510 --> 15:47.313
Shalimar.

15:47.713 --> 15:48.879
Agh.

15:48.914 --> 15:51.317
She lacks your
inner strength.

15:51.352 --> 15:52.918
Make them stop.

15:58.524 --> 15:59.725
Tell me about the
new mutant underground and

15:59.760 --> 16:01.692
i'll make
sure that they stop.

16:01.727 --> 16:06.131
Might even
have a wager on how long
miss delauro will last.

16:06.166 --> 16:10.536
Care to place your bet?

16:36.962 --> 16:44.570
How's it going in
your little dreamscape?

16:44.605 --> 16:48.574
Would you like
to see for yourself?

16:59.785 --> 17:01.787
Don't ever do
that to me again.

17:01.822 --> 17:03.354
You asked to see it.

17:03.389 --> 17:06.992
You do a very good
impression of me.

17:07.027 --> 17:10.596
The look,
the behaviour of the...

17:10.996 --> 17:13.763
choice of language.

17:13.799 --> 17:19.003
You're just more
obvious and predictable
than you'd like to think.

17:19.405 --> 17:24.609
I want the location
of sanctuary and the
data on the underground.

17:24.645 --> 17:28.579
And that's
what you'll get.

17:28.614 --> 17:31.782
You seem to be more interested
in watching her suffer.

17:31.817 --> 17:38.223
I'm doing whatever i need to
do to get anything out of her.

17:38.624 --> 17:41.026
Well, don't kill
her in the process.

17:41.061 --> 17:43.429
I've a stasis pod
with her name on it.

17:43.464 --> 17:45.831
Who is this?

17:52.237 --> 17:54.639
You should
know who she is.

17:54.674 --> 17:57.042
She used to
work at the gsa.

17:57.443 --> 18:03.048
I don't
remember her at all.

18:09.455 --> 18:11.021
Tell me when miss fox breaks.

18:11.056 --> 18:13.859
And let me know when
you're ready for the others.

18:16.662 --> 18:18.263
<gasp>

18:25.070 --> 18:28.273
all ferals have
a primal fear of fire.

18:28.308 --> 18:33.078
Isn't that
right, miss fox?

18:40.686 --> 18:42.888
Why are you
doing this to me?

18:42.923 --> 18:45.090
Because of
what you did to me.

18:45.491 --> 18:46.657
What...?

18:46.692 --> 18:48.694
What did i do?

18:54.700 --> 18:57.503
Tell me what i
need to know, miss fox.

18:57.903 --> 18:59.905
Save your friends.

19:10.716 --> 19:13.519
Well,
have it your way.

19:21.927 --> 19:23.529
It's a burn.

19:23.929 --> 19:27.132
When he connected to her, you
must have read her worst fear.

19:31.537 --> 19:33.504
He's torturing her.

19:33.539 --> 19:36.341
Probably for
information about us.

19:36.742 --> 19:38.343
Well, we can't just
let him do this to her.

19:38.378 --> 19:39.945
We've got to do something, adam.

19:39.980 --> 19:41.512
No.

19:41.547 --> 19:44.349
We gotta rely
on her to tough it out.

20:04.770 --> 20:07.573
You're just
prolonging your agony.

20:10.375 --> 20:11.942
Emma?

20:11.977 --> 20:13.544
It's just a
nightmare, shalimar.

20:13.579 --> 20:16.782
It's not real,
unless you believe it is.

20:16.817 --> 20:19.985
You've got to fight it.

20:20.020 --> 20:22.387
Don't let him win.

20:38.804 --> 20:39.570
Emma.

20:39.605 --> 20:41.572
Emma, don't.

20:41.607 --> 20:43.974
He's got her
trapped somewhere.

20:44.009 --> 20:47.212
It looks like
genomex, but it's not.

20:47.247 --> 20:50.415
It's...
it's a kind of dreamscape.

20:50.450 --> 20:53.035
She's so terrified, adam.

20:53.070 --> 20:55.621
But i think she heard me.

20:55.656 --> 20:58.241
Well, she must have.

20:58.276 --> 21:00.826
Her pulse is dropping.

21:01.226 --> 21:03.228
But, emma,
that was very dangerous?

21:03.263 --> 21:04.394
Right?

21:04.429 --> 21:05.596
You're both psionics.

21:05.631 --> 21:07.232
He could've pulled
you in through her mind.

21:07.267 --> 21:08.398
But he didn't.

21:08.433 --> 21:10.435
And now,
maybe she can fight back.

21:14.840 --> 21:17.642
Even if you get help
from the other side,

21:17.677 --> 21:20.445
i'll never let you out
of this dreamscape.

21:28.320 --> 21:30.722
There's a
couple of non-human
organic and chemical

21:31.123 --> 21:32.724
substances there.

21:32.759 --> 21:34.691
Oil.

21:34.726 --> 21:36.728
Diesel fuel.

21:37.129 --> 21:41.533
That sos that henry sent us
- where did it come from?

21:41.568 --> 21:43.535
Pay phone on dubay street.

21:43.570 --> 21:44.701
Why?

21:44.736 --> 21:46.338
Where the hell is that?

21:47.939 --> 21:50.342
Nothing there
but a couple of scrap metal
shops and a trainyard, why?

21:50.377 --> 21:51.908
Wait, wait, wait.

21:51.943 --> 21:53.510
Trains run on diesel fuel.

21:53.545 --> 21:55.147
Yeah. So does
every truck in the city.

21:55.547 --> 21:58.750
Yeah,
but didn't you say that henry's
father worked for fedrail.

21:58.785 --> 22:01.953
So the trainyard on dubay,
is that one of theirs?

22:06.358 --> 22:09.561
Huh. Fedrail.

22:17.969 --> 22:20.372
Come on,
let's check it out.

22:50.802 --> 22:52.404
No wonder we couldn't get
an address on this guy

22:52.439 --> 22:54.406
- he lives here.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.783
Huh.

23:06.818 --> 23:09.621
Never would've figured him
for a guy that likes vivaldi.

23:26.838 --> 23:29.241
So good friend henry
had a real life once.

23:34.045 --> 23:36.047
Yeah.

23:36.448 --> 23:38.850
Actually looks
like he used to be happy.

23:40.051 --> 23:42.053
She looks pretty.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.858
You know, i'm going to take
this stuff back to adam and see

23:47.259 --> 23:49.226
if he can get anything off it.

23:49.261 --> 23:51.663
His wife was killed
in action, right?

23:51.698 --> 23:53.665
Yeah, apparently.

23:54.065 --> 23:56.668
I wonder who she was fighting?

23:56.703 --> 23:59.271
Well,
it wasn't us. I'd remember.

23:59.671 --> 24:03.640
He thinks it was us.

24:03.675 --> 24:08.079
What if he's blaming us
for what happened to her?

24:08.114 --> 24:10.882
Then he's
looking for revenge.

24:15.687 --> 24:18.089
Agh.

24:22.093 --> 24:23.295
- You okay?
- Yeah.

24:32.103 --> 24:33.705
Brennan.

24:36.508 --> 24:37.674
Agh...

24:37.709 --> 24:39.311
agh, can you
see the mark?

24:39.346 --> 24:40.877
Yeah.

24:40.912 --> 24:42.113
Yeah, but it's already
starting to fade.

24:42.148 --> 24:44.115
You better stay awake.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.282
Yeah, i know.

24:45.317 --> 24:48.520
So henry can read
your fears, huh?

24:48.555 --> 24:49.721
Yeah,
that's what emma said.

24:50.121 --> 24:52.123
Well, he's going to have
plenty to choose from.

24:58.129 --> 25:00.131
Come on,
jesse, you aren't
afraid of anything.

25:00.166 --> 25:01.333
Huh.
Not afraid of anything?

25:01.733 --> 25:04.335
Being buried
alive tops the list.

25:04.370 --> 25:06.938
Look, i can't
be buried alive, okay?

25:06.973 --> 25:10.359
You okay?

25:10.394 --> 25:13.710
Yeah.

25:13.745 --> 25:17.349
This'll make
you feel better.

25:21.753 --> 25:23.354
You all right?

25:23.389 --> 25:24.921
Yeah, it's better.

25:24.956 --> 25:28.159
The minute
you stop moving, you're
going to want to sleep.

25:28.560 --> 25:30.161
I can't stay
awake any more.

25:30.562 --> 25:31.763
Adam.

25:31.798 --> 25:32.929
Jesse.

25:32.964 --> 25:34.566
Oh, isn't there anything
else you can give me?

25:34.601 --> 25:37.334
Jesse, not without
damaging your system.

25:37.369 --> 25:39.771
Whatever henry tries to
make you believe, it's not real.

25:39.806 --> 25:42.591
It's a dreamscape,
all right?

25:42.626 --> 25:45.342
It's happening
in your mind.

25:45.377 --> 25:46.978
It's not real
unless i believe it.

25:47.013 --> 25:47.996
Yeah, that's right.

25:48.031 --> 25:48.980
It's only in your mind.

25:49.381 --> 25:50.146
Okay.

25:50.181 --> 25:51.748
It's only in your mind.

25:51.783 --> 25:55.387
<screaming>
i know this is not real.

25:55.787 --> 25:56.588
This is a... this is a...

25:56.623 --> 25:58.154
this is not real.

25:58.189 --> 25:59.791
Nice try, mr. Kilmartin.

26:00.191 --> 26:04.996
I'm sorry, but what is happening
to you now is very real.

26:06.197 --> 26:06.963
Oh. Oh.

26:06.998 --> 26:09.000
No, no, no, no.

26:09.401 --> 26:09.801
Hey, no.

26:10.201 --> 26:11.002
Not... no.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.004
No, no, no, no, no.

26:13.039 --> 26:14.571
No. No. No. No. No.

26:14.606 --> 26:19.811
Are you asking to negotiate
your freedom for certain

26:20.211 --> 26:23.380
information, mr. Kilmartin?

26:23.415 --> 26:25.382
What...
what sort of information?

26:25.417 --> 26:28.219
Location of sanctuary,
the database of the
new mutant underground.

26:28.254 --> 26:32.188
I didn't think so.

26:32.223 --> 26:35.827
Your feral friend
wasn't much help either.

26:35.862 --> 26:38.630
Not that
that matters anymore.

26:39.030 --> 26:40.631
Where is she?

26:40.666 --> 26:42.198
Where is she?

26:42.233 --> 26:43.034
Tell me where she is.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.001
Tell me.

26:45.036 --> 26:45.837
Tell meeeeee.

26:46.237 --> 26:47.238
Oh, no...

26:47.273 --> 26:48.357
agghhhh.

26:48.392 --> 26:49.441
Aggghhh.

26:49.841 --> 26:51.042
Agh, don't.

26:51.077 --> 26:52.861
Agh, agh...

26:52.896 --> 26:54.646
<crying>

26:57.849 --> 26:59.050
he's not getting enough air.

26:59.085 --> 27:00.652
Give him some oxygen.

27:01.853 --> 27:03.855
Come on,
jesse, breathe.

27:04.255 --> 27:06.457
I want you
to resist it, okay?

27:06.492 --> 27:08.660
It's happening
in your mind.

27:08.695 --> 27:09.461
Breathe.

27:09.861 --> 27:10.862
It's a dreamscape.

27:10.897 --> 27:11.863
Jesse, breathe.

27:12.263 --> 27:13.264
It's not real.

27:13.299 --> 27:14.383
It's not real.

27:14.418 --> 27:15.467
Come on, breathe.

27:16.668 --> 27:18.269
I'm going to give you ten
more cc's of the phenoproxin.

27:18.304 --> 27:19.471
No.

27:19.871 --> 27:21.873
It didn't help jesse.

27:21.908 --> 27:23.475
All right, then.

27:23.875 --> 27:25.476
You have to
tell me your fears.

27:25.511 --> 27:27.078
I don't let myself
think like that.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.080
Come on,
brennan, they're buried
in there somewhere.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.848
Henry's going to find them.

27:31.883 --> 27:35.086
I was afraid of my own
powers when i was a kid.

27:35.121 --> 27:36.252
What?

27:36.287 --> 27:37.889
Of using your powers?

27:38.289 --> 27:40.291
Afraid of them being
used against me.

27:51.503 --> 27:54.706
So how does it
feel to be a victim?

27:55.106 --> 27:58.710
I know
this is a dream and you're
controlling it - henry.

27:58.745 --> 28:01.913
How'd you guess?

28:07.118 --> 28:09.120
You're blaming us for
something that we didn't do.

28:09.521 --> 28:11.923
If it wasn't for you,
my wife would still be...

28:11.958 --> 28:14.290
alive!

28:14.325 --> 28:15.527
What did they tell you, huh?

28:15.927 --> 28:18.730
You're all part of it.

28:25.136 --> 28:27.138
The gsa falsified the reports.

28:27.173 --> 28:29.140
Argh.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.543
<panting> this isn't real.

28:31.578 --> 28:34.746
This isn't real.

28:36.347 --> 28:39.551
Oh, well, then
why did you move when the
electricity came towards you.

28:39.586 --> 28:41.117
I know about your wife.

28:41.152 --> 28:43.555
I'm not interested
in what you have to say.

28:43.590 --> 28:45.156
It's not going
to bring her...

28:45.191 --> 28:47.175
back.

28:47.210 --> 28:49.125
Agghhhh.

28:49.160 --> 28:52.363
<panting> and it's not
going to change anything.

28:52.398 --> 28:54.983
This isn't real.

28:55.018 --> 28:57.694
This isn't real.

28:57.729 --> 29:00.336
This isn't real!

29:00.371 --> 29:03.575
How long are you going to hold
on to the belief that what's

29:03.610 --> 29:07.178
happening in you
right now isn't real?

29:09.180 --> 29:11.182
Any idea?

29:20.925 --> 29:21.726
Is he fighting it?

29:22.127 --> 29:22.927
Yeah.

29:23.328 --> 29:24.929
He's fibrillating
from the shocks.

29:39.344 --> 29:41.746
I just got a
hit off her photo.

29:41.781 --> 29:42.965
Well, she's dead.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.149
How's that possible?

29:44.184 --> 29:45.315
I don't know.

29:45.350 --> 29:46.951
I mean, maybe henry's
trying to trick you.

29:47.352 --> 29:48.953
It wasn't from him.

29:48.988 --> 29:54.524
It's from her.

29:54.559 --> 29:59.364
Henry's wife,
brianna, was studying
to be a concert violinist.

29:59.399 --> 30:02.967
She performed two amateur
concerts and played the same

30:03.002 --> 30:05.370
vivaldi piece in both.

30:05.405 --> 30:06.936
All right.

30:06.971 --> 30:08.173
So what are
you getting at?

30:08.573 --> 30:10.175
Henry loved his
wife so much that...

30:10.575 --> 30:12.577
when she died, he kind of broke.

30:12.977 --> 30:15.345
Maybe she's the
key to reaching him.

30:15.380 --> 30:19.384
Well, look, their life
signs are very erratic.

30:19.784 --> 30:24.589
We need to find
a way to get in there
and distract henry.

30:24.624 --> 30:26.591
You've got to let me see
if i can connect to them.

30:26.626 --> 30:27.757
No, no, no, no.

30:27.792 --> 30:28.993
Because you and
henry are both psionics.

30:29.394 --> 30:30.595
He can manipulate you.

30:30.995 --> 30:32.162
But what if i went in?

30:32.197 --> 30:34.564
You think you can get into
the place where they are?

30:34.599 --> 30:37.402
Yeah, well, i
could use the edd to match
my baseline to theirs.

30:37.437 --> 30:38.603
Ah, but then what?

30:39.003 --> 30:40.605
How are you going to
prove to henry that
we had nothing to

30:40.640 --> 30:42.207
do with the
death of his wife?

30:42.242 --> 30:44.974
I don't know.

30:45.009 --> 30:48.213
But first,
i have an idea about how to
stabilize their vital signs.

30:51.416 --> 30:53.383
You promised me something
you haven't delivered.

30:53.418 --> 30:55.820
Their minds will become
exhausted and they'll no longer

30:55.855 --> 30:57.822
have the energy to fight me.

30:58.223 --> 31:02.227
You must be...

31:02.627 --> 31:06.231
you must be patient...

31:06.631 --> 31:10.635
patient.

31:11.035 --> 31:13.037
And what?

31:13.072 --> 31:14.656
Henry.

31:14.691 --> 31:16.241
Henry.

31:52.277 --> 31:54.279
That's enough.

31:54.679 --> 31:56.646
Good.

31:56.681 --> 31:57.482
All right.

31:57.882 --> 31:59.083
You stabilized them.

31:59.484 --> 32:01.085
This thing is too
risky to maintain connection

32:01.120 --> 32:02.652
with this guy any longer.

32:02.687 --> 32:04.289
All right, so i'm going
to get the stats for the edd.

32:04.324 --> 32:05.890
You let me know
if there's any change.

32:05.925 --> 32:07.492
Okay.

32:29.914 --> 32:33.117
You think
vivaldi makes me nicer?

32:33.152 --> 32:34.684
You're wrong.

32:34.719 --> 32:36.721
Just reminds me how much i
want to make you suffer for what

32:37.121 --> 32:38.323
you did to brianna.

32:38.723 --> 32:39.524
Henry.

32:39.924 --> 32:42.692
You're a psionic.

32:42.727 --> 32:46.331
I can pull
you in here with me.

32:46.366 --> 32:47.897
How about it?

32:47.932 --> 32:50.735
You want to come
play with your friends?

32:50.770 --> 32:52.302
Adam!

32:52.337 --> 32:54.339
He can't help you.

32:54.374 --> 32:56.341
You're already mine.

33:04.749 --> 33:06.751
Adam, you gotta keep
searching henry's bio.

33:06.786 --> 33:08.753
Brianna's death -
it doesn't make any sense.

33:08.788 --> 33:10.355
Are you all right?

33:10.390 --> 33:11.155
Emma.

33:11.556 --> 33:13.357
Oh, god.

33:13.392 --> 33:15.159
Emma.

33:15.560 --> 33:16.761
Lie down.

33:16.796 --> 33:18.180
Emma.

33:18.215 --> 33:19.529
Oh, god.

33:19.564 --> 33:24.369
Now,
you remember what we told
them - it's a dreamscape.

33:24.404 --> 33:26.736
Resist.

33:26.771 --> 33:29.574
It's a dream.

33:29.609 --> 33:31.576
Emma.

33:34.379 --> 33:36.781
No!

33:49.594 --> 33:52.397
They're all in there now and
they'll pay for what they did.

33:52.797 --> 33:54.764
Mr. Voight, as i feared,

33:54.799 --> 33:57.802
you seem to have lost
sight of your immediate goal.

33:57.837 --> 34:00.805
My wife died in the crossfire
in a battle between your

34:00.840 --> 34:04.008
gsagents and mutant x.

34:04.043 --> 34:05.209
Yes, of course.

34:05.610 --> 34:06.776
Tragedy beyond reckoning.

34:06.811 --> 34:09.213
- I blame mutantx.
- As you should, but...

34:09.248 --> 34:11.179
and i blame you.

34:11.215 --> 34:14.418
You should have protected her.

34:14.819 --> 34:20.425
She wasn't trained or prepared
for those kinds of operations.

34:20.460 --> 34:24.393
If she was out...

34:24.429 --> 34:28.433
<sighs>... in the field.

34:28.467 --> 34:30.400
What's the matter?

34:30.435 --> 34:32.437
You... you feeling tired?

34:32.472 --> 34:34.038
What do you mean?

34:34.438 --> 34:36.040
I wondered how long my toxins
would take to seep through

34:36.074 --> 34:39.609
your plastic skin.

34:39.643 --> 34:43.648
Remember i showed
you the dreamscape?

34:51.656 --> 34:54.424
Oh my god.

34:54.458 --> 34:56.860
Are you ready
for your nightmare?

35:36.501 --> 35:38.503
No!

35:48.112 --> 35:50.114
Get me out of here.

35:53.317 --> 35:55.319
This is not happening.

36:19.343 --> 36:22.947
She's a section nine.

36:38.963 --> 36:41.565
You looking for me?

36:41.600 --> 36:44.168
Or him, perhaps?

36:44.203 --> 36:45.387
Adam.

36:45.422 --> 36:46.571
Adam?

36:46.971 --> 36:49.173
They're all
here, somewhere.

36:49.208 --> 36:51.340
I know he's
not in the pod,

36:51.375 --> 36:53.377
henry, because you're
not in control here.

36:53.412 --> 36:54.979
I am.

36:58.583 --> 37:00.985
Only for the moment.

37:01.385 --> 37:04.989
<laughing> where are they?

37:05.389 --> 37:07.757
They're around.

37:07.792 --> 37:09.393
Very strong, sturdy group.

37:09.794 --> 37:14.198
They were able to
confront their worst fears.

37:14.233 --> 37:16.165
You were lucky
to have known them.

37:16.200 --> 37:19.003
I hope you know you can't
leave here unless i release you.

37:19.038 --> 37:21.806
I know that.

37:22.206 --> 37:24.208
I'm not planning on
letting any of you go.

37:24.243 --> 37:25.775
Henry.

37:25.810 --> 37:28.212
What would you do if i could
give you back the thing

37:28.247 --> 37:29.413
you want the most?

37:29.814 --> 37:31.215
Nothing i want.

37:31.250 --> 37:33.134
Brianna's alive.

37:33.169 --> 37:34.984
Don't lie to me.

37:35.019 --> 37:36.986
She's in section nine.

37:37.021 --> 37:39.423
It's a high security
storage area at the gsa.

37:39.458 --> 37:40.842
My wife is dead.

37:40.877 --> 37:42.191
You killed her.

37:42.226 --> 37:43.828
Well, that's what
the gsa report said.

37:43.863 --> 37:45.394
But, of course, it's not true.

37:45.429 --> 37:47.832
What if i could
give you her back?

37:47.867 --> 37:50.234
What would you do?

37:50.269 --> 37:53.402
Fine.

37:53.437 --> 37:56.641
If you don't believe me,
let's go find eckhart.

38:14.058 --> 38:16.025
Adam?

38:16.060 --> 38:18.462
Are you real or...

38:18.863 --> 38:22.066
just some other horrible
figment of my imagination?

38:26.070 --> 38:28.472
Tell henry what
you know about his wife.

38:30.074 --> 38:33.242
I told him before.

38:33.277 --> 38:36.080
I don't remember
a thing about her.

38:36.480 --> 38:38.047
Look at my skin.

38:38.082 --> 38:40.885
The bacteria from all this
filth has already infiltrated.

38:40.920 --> 38:42.887
Mason, look at me.

38:42.922 --> 38:45.254
Look at me.

38:45.289 --> 38:48.492
Tell him what
a section nine is.

38:52.096 --> 38:54.098
Get me out of
here and i'll tell him.

38:54.133 --> 38:55.264
You tell him now.

38:55.299 --> 38:57.301
I'm slightly
distracted in here.

38:57.336 --> 39:01.270
Agh...

39:01.305 --> 39:05.309
when one of our gsagents
is deemed unreliable,

39:05.344 --> 39:07.311
we put him in section nine.

39:07.346 --> 39:10.479
Is she...

39:10.514 --> 39:12.081
she dead or not?

39:12.116 --> 39:14.118
If she's in
section nine, she's alive.

39:14.153 --> 39:16.485
She's in stasis.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.122
Why...
why didn't you tell me?

39:18.522 --> 39:19.689
I didn't know.

39:19.724 --> 39:21.691
She must have been...

39:21.726 --> 39:25.329
so far down the
bureaucratic chain that
i wasn't even informed.

39:25.364 --> 39:27.331
She hated working for you.

39:27.732 --> 39:31.701
She hated everything
about what you did.

39:31.736 --> 39:34.538
Must have been why her
reliability was questioned.

39:34.573 --> 39:37.306
Let the others go.

39:37.341 --> 39:40.544
You can keep me here
until you get brianna back.

40:30.594 --> 40:33.362
Wonder why
he's not waking up?

40:33.397 --> 40:35.800
Maybe henry doesn't
want to let him go.

41:00.624 --> 41:03.427
Brianna voight is
in a pod in section nine.

41:03.828 --> 41:05.830
If she's
not gone, let her out.

41:05.865 --> 41:07.797
Make sure henry finds her.

41:07.832 --> 41:11.035
Make sure they
both leave the premises.

41:13.437 --> 41:17.041
And someone
find me my clothes.

41:24.248 --> 41:26.050
Adam.

41:26.085 --> 41:27.852
Shalimar.

41:27.887 --> 41:29.471
Hey.

41:29.506 --> 41:31.055
Oh, hey.

41:31.455 --> 41:33.457
Is everybody okay?

41:33.858 --> 41:34.658
Yeah.

41:35.059 --> 41:37.261
Henry found his wife?

41:37.296 --> 41:39.428
Yeah. I think so.

41:39.463 --> 41:42.266
Otherwise, he wouldn't
have let me go.

41:42.666 --> 41:45.069
Wonder if he and brianna
are going to move back

41:45.104 --> 41:51.440
into the
trainyard together?

41:51.475 --> 41:53.477
I don't know if i could
deal with seeing henry again.

41:53.512 --> 41:54.643
No.

41:54.678 --> 41:56.280
Well,
i don't think
you'll have to.

41:56.680 --> 41:58.247
I think they're
both long gone.

41:58.282 --> 42:01.085
Well, i hope they
live happily ever after.

42:01.485 --> 42:03.087
Yeah, so do i.
