[inmates clamoring]

01:20.497 --> 01:21.874
[inmate 1] Pull that trigger.

01:26.879 --> 01:28.463
Shoot him in his head.

01:28.546 --> 01:30.799
[Brandy] Come on! What the fuck
are you waiting for?

01:35.053 --> 01:37.890
We are laying low
and we're staying out of trouble.

01:37.973 --> 01:40.934
That's right. We see trouble,
we turn around and walk the other way.

01:41.018 --> 01:43.646
- We are out of the business.
- Holy shit.

01:45.689 --> 01:47.941
- Is this a real riot?
- [door opening]

01:48.025 --> 01:49.276
This is a real riot.

01:50.277 --> 01:51.319
If this is a real riot,

01:51.403 --> 01:54.489
do you think this is a step forward
or backwards for equality?

01:54.572 --> 01:56.700
I don't care.
And we're getting out of here now.

01:56.784 --> 01:57.785
Come on.

01:59.327 --> 02:00.996
Are you kidding me?
Come on.

02:01.079 --> 02:02.080
Fine.

02:05.042 --> 02:06.418
I need it to be quiet.

02:07.878 --> 02:09.211
Could everybody be quiet?

02:12.257 --> 02:13.091
God damn it.

02:13.175 --> 02:14.760
[inmates exclaiming]

02:14.843 --> 02:17.638
Ah! Oh, shit. I got hit with the casing.
Am I bleeding?

02:17.721 --> 02:18.806
You got a mark for sure.

02:18.889 --> 02:20.974
Could everybody just shut the fuck up
so I can think?

02:21.058 --> 02:22.517
Less think. More shoot!

02:22.600 --> 02:25.646
You better shut your mouth before
she pops that balloon head of yours.

02:26.604 --> 02:30.275
Yo, if she shoot this guy,
we gonna get guard brains all over us.

02:30.358 --> 02:32.277
Ew. No, these are my good pants.

02:32.360 --> 02:35.072
- That's what I'm saying.
- I had frogs when I was a kid.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.389
We lived by a creek. We used to
scoop them up into buckets...

02:38.450 --> 02:41.286
I don't wanna hear your fuckin' story.
Shut the fuck up.

02:42.495 --> 02:44.915
[in Spanish] I brought some
to school once, and after that,

02:45.749 --> 02:48.961
everyone called me
Tommy the Toad-boy,

02:49.544 --> 02:51.546
even though they were clearly frogs.

02:51.629 --> 02:55.092
See, he doing that thing, trying
to make her see he a person and shit.

02:55.968 --> 02:58.220
You know, I seen that shit on <i>Oprah</i>
back in the day.

02:58.303 --> 03:01.389
I think it's time
to get the hell out of Dodge.

03:01.473 --> 03:04.517
Uh-uh. I gotta see how this ends.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.120
[in Spanish] My sister Dana
always got A's in biology.

03:06.144 --> 03:07.771
I have two sisters.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.357
- [Humphrey groaning]
- [inmates exclaiming]

03:10.440 --> 03:12.860
- I don't fuckin' speak Spanish.
- [groans louder]

03:14.652 --> 03:16.739
She told him
[in Spanish] to shut the fuck up.

03:16.822 --> 03:19.616
- [breathing heavily]
- Okay, now we can go.

03:19.699 --> 03:21.326
No, no, that... that was shots fired.

03:21.409 --> 03:22.535
What?

03:23.746 --> 03:25.205
It's Humps. [sighs]

03:25.288 --> 03:26.539
How?

03:26.623 --> 03:30.335
Uh, Dixon let him through with a piece.

03:31.503 --> 03:33.213
I might have been there, too.

03:33.296 --> 03:35.673
Dude, if he's pulling a Columbine,
that is so on you.

03:35.758 --> 03:37.443
[stammers] He made
some very convincing arguments.

03:37.467 --> 03:38.761
He's a freak, man.

03:38.844 --> 03:40.262
Yeah. Right? [scoffs]

03:41.054 --> 03:42.597
Jesus.

03:42.680 --> 03:43.724
Fuck.

03:43.807 --> 03:46.351
Jesus fuck!
That was definitely a gunshot.

03:46.434 --> 03:47.519
Where are we gonna go?

03:47.602 --> 03:51.398
I don't know. Maybe the dorms?
Hide under the covers until it's over.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.650
'Cause prison blankets are so bulletproof.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.944
- [inmate 1] Fuck, yeah!
- [inmates continue clamoring]

03:56.028 --> 03:57.195
[inmate 2] Fuck off!

03:58.405 --> 04:00.282
[inmate 3 laughing] Whoa!

04:00.365 --> 04:03.493
- [glass shatters]
- [inmate 4 cheers]

04:04.828 --> 04:06.371
[grunts]

04:32.105 --> 04:33.875
- [Josh] You went off book.
- [glass shatters]

04:33.899 --> 04:35.233
Did you hear something?

04:35.317 --> 04:37.027
The sound of you fucking up.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.320
I did the right thing.

04:38.403 --> 04:39.947
Oh, you're so sure about that, huh?

04:40.030 --> 04:43.116
What, your vast PR experience
led you to that conclusion?

04:43.200 --> 04:45.618
And you were ready
to send that kid to prison for...

04:45.702 --> 04:46.912
Killing someone.

04:46.995 --> 04:49.706
Shall we go over the facts again?

04:50.582 --> 04:52.750
You should start working on your résumé.

04:52.835 --> 04:55.128
Yeah? You should...

04:55.879 --> 04:58.841
go back to the tight suit store.
Mind your own business.

04:58.924 --> 05:02.052
[scoffs] I rock this suit, you schlepper.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.491
[Stratman on radio]
<i>Anyone got eyes on Humps?</i>

05:07.515 --> 05:09.076
<i>- Humps, you there?</i>
- You really did it.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.204
- Yeah. I'm full of surprises.
- [Stratman] <i>Dude, what's going on?</i>

05:11.228 --> 05:12.270
I need medical attention.

05:12.354 --> 05:13.730
You need to shut your mouth.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.190
- [groans]
- [inmates exclaiming]

05:15.273 --> 05:16.316
I say finish him off.

05:16.399 --> 05:19.111
- Dead men can't point fingers.
- [Brandy gasps]

05:19.194 --> 05:20.863
[grunting]

05:20.946 --> 05:23.156
[chuckles] Good.
This feels good.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.241
Right?

05:25.033 --> 05:28.536
If you kill him,
you probably gonna have to kill her, too.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.181
No, no, no. Please,
I don't know anything.

05:30.205 --> 05:31.373
I didn't see anything.

05:31.456 --> 05:33.458
Nah, man.
They don't seem to care about our lives,

05:33.541 --> 05:35.836
so why we gotta give a shit
if they live or die?

05:35.919 --> 05:37.629
I do. I do.
I care so much.

05:37.712 --> 05:38.713
[Maritza grunting]

05:38.796 --> 05:40.733
Should I finish him off,
or you two gonna kick him to death?

05:40.757 --> 05:42.634
[Maritza and Sankey grunting]

05:43.676 --> 05:45.095
[Gloria] Daya!

05:45.178 --> 05:46.780
She don't know what the fuck she's doing.

05:46.804 --> 05:49.224
I got blood on my cuff.
Great.

05:49.307 --> 05:51.434
[clicks tongue] Let's go.
We got business.

05:51.518 --> 05:52.852
[Gloria] No! No! No!

05:52.936 --> 05:54.604
No! Stop!

05:54.687 --> 05:55.898
- [gasping]
- No!

05:55.981 --> 05:59.442
Okay, it's not too late. Nobody's dead.
We can still pull this back.

05:59.526 --> 06:02.112
Pull back?
I shot a guard in the dick.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.781
Almost.
This shit got serious kickback.

06:04.864 --> 06:07.325
Hell, Gloria, respect and all, but...

06:07.409 --> 06:09.744
"too late" is way in the rearview, man.

06:09.827 --> 06:11.204
We're taking this motherfucker.

06:11.914 --> 06:13.040
[grunts]

06:13.123 --> 06:15.959
Whoa! Whoa, Ramos, hold up.
He'll be way more valuable alive.

06:24.259 --> 06:25.427
Who's in?

06:26.344 --> 06:27.595
[inmates clamoring]

06:27.679 --> 06:29.597
Yo, are those noise-canceling headphones?

06:29.681 --> 06:30.890
Is that Love's Baby Soft?

06:30.974 --> 06:32.392
This does not end well.

06:32.475 --> 06:34.978
Like it was going so good before? Huh?

06:35.062 --> 06:36.813
Okay, we need a plan.

06:36.896 --> 06:40.067
Yo, who's the one in charge here?
You with the mouth, or me with the gun?

06:40.150 --> 06:41.627
Hey, you wanna be in charge?
It's fine by me.

06:41.651 --> 06:44.047
All right, why don't you both
just calm down, all right? Just...

06:44.071 --> 06:46.174
[Dixon on radio] <i>Someone tell me</i>
<i>what the hell is going on.</i>

06:46.198 --> 06:47.282
[Humphrey panting]

06:47.365 --> 06:49.326
- You. Answer it.
- What, seriously?

06:49.409 --> 06:50.535
Yeah! Be her.

06:50.618 --> 06:52.204
- What's her name again?
- [gasps]

06:52.287 --> 06:53.746
You, tell her your name.

06:53.830 --> 06:54.957
McCull... McCullough.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.375
- Artesian McCullough.
- Artesian?

06:57.459 --> 06:59.419
It's a town in South Dakota.

06:59.502 --> 07:00.878
[clears throat]

07:01.879 --> 07:04.967
McCullough here.
Uh, shots fired by Humps.

07:05.050 --> 07:07.135
Guy's going nuts, full-on Sandy Hook.

07:07.219 --> 07:08.428
Hide. Ahhh!

07:08.511 --> 07:09.596
Shh. Shh.

07:09.679 --> 07:10.722
[radio static]

07:11.723 --> 07:13.016
Not bad, huh?

07:13.100 --> 07:14.892
[alarm blaring loudly]

07:14.977 --> 07:16.436
[inmates exclaiming]

07:17.562 --> 07:19.022
Yo, seriously?

07:19.106 --> 07:20.941
Are you not paying attention here?

07:21.024 --> 07:23.986
Get your asses up off the floor
before this one shoots you.

07:24.069 --> 07:25.445
Right? Right?

07:25.528 --> 07:27.489
Yeah. Right.

07:27.572 --> 07:29.675
Yo, go figure out how to shut that off.
I'm getting a head...

07:29.699 --> 07:31.201
- [Flaca grunts]
- [all exclaiming]

07:31.284 --> 07:34.121
Oh, shit. [breathing heavily]

07:34.204 --> 07:35.956
Fuck. It's warm.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.000
That's a lot of blood.

07:38.708 --> 07:41.669
- [inmates clamoring]
- Oh, what a fucking mess.

07:41.753 --> 07:44.589
- I think it's exciting.
- [scoffs] You would.

07:44.672 --> 07:47.925
We should try to grab some provisions
while the grabbin' is good.

07:48.010 --> 07:50.220
Might be nice for later if we're holed up.

07:50.303 --> 07:54.641
The jackboots will be back soon, stomping.
I don't see this thing going long.

07:54.724 --> 07:58.270
Mmm! Better to be prepared
for shit that don't happen

07:58.353 --> 08:00.897
than to have shit happen
and not be prepared.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.690
Seize your opportunities.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.030
Grab for both of us, would you?

08:08.113 --> 08:11.283
- Where are you going?
- To seize some opportunity.

08:11.366 --> 08:12.909
That's a little vague.

08:12.993 --> 08:16.371
No one's minding the store,
so I'm going exploring.

08:16.454 --> 08:17.872
Deep dive.

08:18.748 --> 08:21.751
I still don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.295
Oh, fuck it.

08:23.378 --> 08:25.880
[Chang banging on door]
This is my turf, assholes.

08:25.963 --> 08:27.299
Let me back in.

08:27.382 --> 08:28.508
[Big Boo] Sorry, Chang.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.635
Red dragon's out in this new economy.

08:30.718 --> 08:33.638
Yeah, go, like,
fly a big kite that looks like a bird.

08:33.721 --> 08:36.390
- What are those Chinese birds called?
- [chuckling] Phoenix?

08:36.474 --> 08:40.437
Phoenix! Go fly a Phoenix kite
all the way to Arizona, Chang.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.105
Not your strongest, but good effort.

08:42.188 --> 08:45.233
[Chang] Can I at least get
Dr. Scholl's gel inserts,

08:45.317 --> 08:49.237
calcium tabs, a radio,
four pencils and some honey?

08:49.862 --> 08:50.947
Throw a dog a bone.

08:52.824 --> 08:54.617
[Big Boo grunts] God's sake.

08:54.701 --> 08:57.162
- [alarm continues blaring]
- [clamoring continues]

08:57.245 --> 08:58.288
Yeah.

08:59.456 --> 09:00.498
Here you go.

09:01.416 --> 09:02.459
No funny stuff.

09:03.168 --> 09:04.211
Fine.

09:11.593 --> 09:12.635
Piece of shit.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.347
You're welcome.

09:15.430 --> 09:17.099
Hold up! Hold up.

09:17.182 --> 09:18.725
[Pennsatucky] No, we're closed.
Closed.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.310
[speaking Spanish]

09:20.393 --> 09:23.063
Yeah, well, I need padlocks,
all the locks you got,

09:23.146 --> 09:24.915
and anything else
that's good for barricading.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.608
Shit! It's really happening?

09:26.691 --> 09:28.332
You think I'm starting a lock collection?

09:29.026 --> 09:30.903
- [sighs]
- Hey, you don't get any candy...

09:30.987 --> 09:32.780
[stammers] It's just not gonna happen.

09:32.864 --> 09:35.950
Because Boo taught me
to have a proper candy feast,

09:36.033 --> 09:39.787
you gotta have salty and sweet,
or it's... it's vice versa. Right?

09:39.871 --> 09:41.373
- Just true.
- It's true.

09:41.456 --> 09:43.250
- Sweet and savory.
- Don't give her candy.

09:43.333 --> 09:44.334
Classic.

09:48.045 --> 09:49.506
Go with God.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.675
Oh, and do you have any of those,
um, how do you call 'em?

09:52.759 --> 09:54.636
Those... Islam head-cover thingies?

09:54.719 --> 09:56.053
- A hijab?
- [Blanca] Hmm.

09:56.138 --> 09:57.930
How the fuck do you know the word "hijab"?

09:58.014 --> 09:59.200
'Cause I learned it in church.

09:59.224 --> 10:01.684
Hijab-wearing enemy of Christ.

10:02.394 --> 10:05.563
Yeah, I like the way that sounds
coming out. It's bouncy. You know, hijab.

10:05.647 --> 10:06.832
- [chuckles]
- Oh, I found 'em.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.150
Hijabs right here.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.195
[Big Boo chuckles]

10:12.279 --> 10:13.863
Thank you. Thank you.

10:13.946 --> 10:16.199
Take those.
Whoa! Hey.

10:16.283 --> 10:19.244
- [Blanca] What?
- [sniffing] You're still kind of ripe.

10:19.327 --> 10:20.453
Hold up.

10:21.496 --> 10:23.915
You know, if you're gonna,
like, go and take over,

10:23.998 --> 10:25.875
you might wanna do it right.

10:27.710 --> 10:29.045
[sighs] I guess.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.548
Have fun storming the castle!

10:32.674 --> 10:33.925
What... what castle?

10:36.344 --> 10:37.929
[toilet flushes]

10:46.103 --> 10:47.189
Ugh.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.115
[inmates clamoring]

10:58.200 --> 10:59.659
[shouting indistinctly]

11:02.078 --> 11:03.079
[grunting]

11:10.295 --> 11:13.130
Yeah! [whooping]

11:13.215 --> 11:16.343
[Angie] You get the credit card,
and you swipe it through there, and then...

11:16.426 --> 11:18.052
[Leanne] Drugs! Drugs!

11:21.556 --> 11:24.309
Oh, shoot.
Somebody beat us to the punch.

11:24.392 --> 11:25.869
No, look,
they're not in the cage yet.

11:25.893 --> 11:27.144
There's still opportunity here.

11:27.229 --> 11:28.831
Uh, don't you wanna try
for something else?

11:28.855 --> 11:31.816
We could go to electrical.
We could make a ham radio.

11:31.899 --> 11:34.380
We could string up the holiday lights,
make it all atmospheric.

11:34.444 --> 11:36.738
I'll let you tie me up
with an extension cord

11:36.821 --> 11:38.072
if you ask real nice.

11:38.155 --> 11:39.633
- No, you won't.
- You're right. I won't.

11:39.657 --> 11:41.378
I'm still sorting through
some trust issues.

11:41.451 --> 11:42.619
But listen...

11:42.702 --> 11:45.997
I don't think you
in a room full of medicine

11:46.080 --> 11:48.416
is such a swell idea
for your sobriety right now.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.584
Are you hearing?

11:49.667 --> 11:53.380
Yes. Yes, I hear you,
and I appreciate what you're saying, okay?

11:53.463 --> 11:56.633
But this... this is a purely practical,
tactical move.

11:56.716 --> 12:00.970
I mean, the weak-wristed, short-statured,
white-girl contingent that we represent,

12:01.053 --> 12:02.096
we need a stronghold.

12:02.179 --> 12:06.309
If I've learned anything from
this grand corporatocracy we call America,

12:06.393 --> 12:08.311
Big Pharma rules, right?

12:08.395 --> 12:13.024
So does Little Pharma, Medium Pharma,
and Pharma of all sizes.

12:13.107 --> 12:14.776
Let them eat Prozac!

12:14.859 --> 12:20.532
You are a very sneaky junkie person,
and you are playing with fire.

12:20.615 --> 12:23.285
Well, come be the wet blanket
wrapped around my body.

12:23.368 --> 12:24.952
I won't be your wet blanket.

12:25.036 --> 12:28.748
Okay, so great. Huh?
Moving forward.

12:28.831 --> 12:30.207
No, wait.
What? No.

12:30.292 --> 12:32.419
Hey, fool!
Fool follower!

12:32.502 --> 12:35.505
- [pants] We got here first.
- Yeah! Buzz off!

12:35.588 --> 12:37.650
You really think you're gonna be able
to chew through that steel

12:37.674 --> 12:38.966
with your meth teeth?

12:39.050 --> 12:42.261
Maybe. We believe in ourselves.

12:42.345 --> 12:43.513
[grunting]

12:45.848 --> 12:48.393
No, Ang, she's right.
We need a key.

12:48.476 --> 12:49.977
Like a skeleton key.

12:50.061 --> 12:53.147
No. No way.
Skeletons freak me out.

12:53.230 --> 12:55.942
Well, maybe we could melt it.
You got a lighter?

12:56.025 --> 12:59.612
No... Oh, but, once I saw this video

12:59.696 --> 13:02.574
where all you'll need is a lemon,
and steel nails,

13:02.657 --> 13:05.368
and copper pegs, and plain wire,
and coated wire, and steel wool,

13:05.452 --> 13:08.287
and some kind of kindling to make a fire.
We could totally do that.

13:08.371 --> 13:11.499
[panting] I don't know.
Where are we gonna find a lemon?

13:11.583 --> 13:13.710
Come on.
I got an idea.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.002
When life gives you lemons...

13:18.005 --> 13:20.025
[Zirconia] We need, like,
lots of CCs of medicine stat!

13:20.049 --> 13:21.133
Is he still breathing?

13:21.217 --> 13:24.053
You check. He puked on himself
and if I get too close, I get the pukes.

13:24.136 --> 13:25.347
I'm like that.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.682
Sophia! Sophia Burset.
Come on, wake the fuck up.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.642
[stammers] We need help here.

13:29.726 --> 13:31.436
What do we do for a gunshot wound?
Come on.

13:32.937 --> 13:34.606
[Sophia] That's a lot of blood.

13:34.689 --> 13:37.292
Looks like they hit a vein or something.
You need to stop the bleeding.

13:37.316 --> 13:39.527
- No shit.
- Anyone got a tampon?

13:39.611 --> 13:41.779
You can stick one in the wound,
then apply pressure.

13:41.863 --> 13:42.739
Ain't nobody got tampons.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.883
Those things are like wheat pennies
around here. Where you been?

13:44.907 --> 13:46.868
She don't use tampons.
Don't be insensitive.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.596
- I forgot.
- Can you get him out of there?

13:48.620 --> 13:50.037
[Pidge] Come on.

13:51.623 --> 13:52.749
[Humphrey groans]

13:52.832 --> 13:55.543
Oh! I need a doctor.

13:56.210 --> 13:59.088
Well, you got me.
I used to be a fireman.

13:59.171 --> 14:00.715
I'm trained in emergency medicine.

14:00.798 --> 14:03.217
No, I need a surgeon,
not a fucking fire-tranny.

14:03.801 --> 14:06.053
Hey, I don't care if you bleed out.

14:06.137 --> 14:07.555
I can get back to my magazine,

14:07.639 --> 14:10.349
and you can die on the floor
and go straight to hell.

14:10.433 --> 14:12.810
No, you got to.
He can't die on us...

14:12.894 --> 14:15.021
or that's a murder charge.

14:15.104 --> 14:18.107
He can't die. Please.
It's not for him. It's for me.

14:18.190 --> 14:19.401
Did you do this?

14:19.484 --> 14:20.485
No, but...

14:20.568 --> 14:23.696
Yo, his skin be going all gray
like he's cloudy and overcast.

14:23.780 --> 14:24.864
[mouthing] Please.

14:26.741 --> 14:29.118
For you. Not for him.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.747
Find me some disinfectant
and something like gauze,

14:32.830 --> 14:34.416
some tweezers.

14:34.499 --> 14:37.585
And honestly,
if you still got drugs around here,

14:37.669 --> 14:39.128
you might wanna give him a taste.

14:39.211 --> 14:42.092
No way. That's more valuable than
wheat pennies and tampons put together.

14:42.131 --> 14:44.300
Would bleach work as disinfectant?

14:44.384 --> 14:46.135
No. No! No.

14:46.218 --> 14:47.470
Thank you.

14:47.554 --> 14:50.222
Let's see if he lives
before you go thanking me too much.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.814
Looks like someone forgot to do laundry.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.568
You wanna move it
to the side for me, cowboy?

15:01.651 --> 15:02.944
It's in my way.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.490
[indistinct chatter]

15:13.746 --> 15:16.499
- What?
- I'm super mad at you.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.919
Is this because I wouldn't let you
use my apricot facial scrub?

15:20.002 --> 15:23.423
It was at the end of the tube, I swear.
You could check, even.

15:23.506 --> 15:27.427
How could you go to a riot without me?
What happened to "Team Flaritza"?

15:27.510 --> 15:29.386
I got called up for van duty last minute.

15:29.471 --> 15:31.347
And I thought we decided on Team Maraca.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.474
No, we didn't.

15:32.557 --> 15:34.478
We said that that sounded
like two rumba shakers,

15:34.517 --> 15:36.686
not two unique individuals
sharing one nickname.

15:36.769 --> 15:37.937
Oh, yeah, that's right.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.106
I came down
a whole other hallway from you.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.149
You were supposed to be my riot buddy.

15:42.233 --> 15:45.570
Did you see me push him?
And then kick him later?

15:45.653 --> 15:46.738
Of course I did.

15:46.821 --> 15:49.240
That was some excellent
pushing and kicking,

15:49.323 --> 15:51.301
but I would've gotten in some,
you know, head shots.

15:51.325 --> 15:52.494
I was getting to that.

15:52.577 --> 15:55.222
Working the body first, and then
that was gonna be, like, my finale.

15:55.246 --> 15:57.123
Boot right in his stupid, evil face.

15:57.206 --> 15:59.000
Shit. I would've loved that.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.461
[Maritza] Gloria came
and pooped my whole party.

16:01.544 --> 16:03.505
And I'm sorry
we couldn't go together, but...

16:03.588 --> 16:05.214
[Maria] Oh, I don't think so.

16:05.297 --> 16:07.884
Girl, you wanna be the <i>jefa</i> in charge,
you can't be napping.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.386
There's shit to do,
shit that might need a gun to do.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.510
The Nazi chicks, they might need backup
while they're rounding up the guards.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.182
I'm tired.

16:15.266 --> 16:16.643
Don't matter if you're tired.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.435
Whoa, I said I'm tired.

16:19.311 --> 16:20.563
I'm gonna rest for a bit,

16:20.647 --> 16:23.315
and then I'll go get shit done,
or whatever.

16:23.399 --> 16:24.526
Sounds good to you?

16:25.442 --> 16:26.736
Best plan ever.

16:30.948 --> 16:31.949
I'm heading out.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.553
You know, you could probably
leave your boxes packed.

16:34.577 --> 16:36.954
Easier to clear out
when MCC calls and fires you.

16:37.038 --> 16:39.999
Where the hell did you put my radio
and the goddamn phone cord?

16:40.082 --> 16:42.669
I gotta shut this fucking alarm,
and I can't reach my people.

16:42.752 --> 16:43.753
Where'd you put it?

16:43.836 --> 16:46.589
I don't know.
Didn't your assistant pack everything up?

16:46.673 --> 16:48.257
Right.
Move outta the way.

16:52.136 --> 16:54.471
Nothing. Label makers.

16:54.556 --> 16:56.641
Empty goddamn Good & Plenty boxes.

16:56.724 --> 16:58.184
Some organization you run.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.310
Ran.

16:59.393 --> 17:02.396
Oh, you got a problem
with how I do shit, pretty boy?

17:02.479 --> 17:04.898
Taystee? What are you doing?

17:06.150 --> 17:08.986
I'm telling the real story,
'cause you sure the hell didn't.

17:09.069 --> 17:11.071
Where the fuck the cameras go?

17:11.155 --> 17:12.699
They left to go home,

17:12.781 --> 17:14.134
- which is what I'm gonna do.
- [sighs]

17:14.157 --> 17:16.661
- So, excuse me.
- Oh, oh, wait. Excuse you?

17:16.743 --> 17:18.287
I don't think so.

17:18.369 --> 17:21.999
Hey, you ever been whacked in the head
full force with a chair leg?

17:22.083 --> 17:25.294
Yeah, see, and this screw right here
looks pretty rusty.

17:25.377 --> 17:28.297
I think you gonna need
a shot for tetanus if you live.

17:29.173 --> 17:30.967
Oh, hell no.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.635
[groans]

17:33.219 --> 17:36.472
Stay the fuck down, Captain America,
or you ain't never makin' babies.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.265
Jesus Christ!
Are you insane?

17:38.349 --> 17:41.060
No, she's angry.
We're all angry.

17:41.143 --> 17:45.147
You done our girl wrong, Mr. Caputo,
and you gonna fix it.

17:47.399 --> 17:51.153
Taystee... this is a very delicate situ...

17:51.237 --> 17:52.363
[grunts]

17:54.782 --> 17:56.242
You gonna make this right.

18:00.705 --> 18:03.540
- [inmates clamoring]
- [alarm continues blaring]

18:06.210 --> 18:07.211
[grunts]

18:32.945 --> 18:35.447
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Time out, time out.
I come in peace.

18:35.531 --> 18:37.158
And you go the same way.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.619
Will you put that thing down, please?
Just... Come on.

18:39.702 --> 18:40.846
[stammers] Can't we both be here?

18:40.870 --> 18:42.288
- No.
- Come on.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.749
Clearly we both have a similar plan, huh?

18:44.832 --> 18:46.472
- Maybe we can help each other.
- [scoffs]

18:46.959 --> 18:51.047
- What did he take from you?
- My dignity, my humanity and my sleep.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.464
Oh.

18:52.548 --> 18:54.634
Well, he took my carved soaps.

18:54.717 --> 18:56.803
What? He took your what?

18:56.886 --> 18:59.847
It's my art.
And I spent a lot of time on them.

18:59.931 --> 19:01.057
And they're beautiful.

19:01.140 --> 19:04.018
And... and that piece of shit
Paul Bunyan confiscated them,

19:04.101 --> 19:05.102
and I want them back.

19:05.186 --> 19:07.354
Not my circus, not my monkeys.

19:07.438 --> 19:09.691
Oh, I like that.
Did you come up with that?

19:09.774 --> 19:10.900
No, it's Polish.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.903
Oh, I mean, I'm not a huge fan of Poles.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.698
No, me neither,
but they have some good maxims.

19:16.781 --> 19:19.659
Oh, Jesus, this is heavy. [groans]

19:19.742 --> 19:22.286
Go. Look for your soaps.

19:23.955 --> 19:27.124
Anything I can keep an eye out for
for you?

19:27.208 --> 19:31.838
Or is the point simply to just vent
through wanton destruction?

19:31.921 --> 19:33.673
I'm looking for revenge.

19:33.756 --> 19:37.719
[grunts] When spider webs unite,
they can tie up a lion.

19:37.802 --> 19:40.805
That's African.
I learned it on safari.

19:40.888 --> 19:41.931
Bingo!

19:42.014 --> 19:43.182
What did you find?

19:43.265 --> 19:44.391
[sighs]

19:44.475 --> 19:47.353
Oh! [sniffs]
Aren't they nice?

19:47.436 --> 19:48.771
Wonderful.

19:48.855 --> 19:51.065
What else is in there?
What's that book?

19:56.195 --> 20:00.157
[scoffs] Jesus. What a dork.
You should use this.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.493
It's petty.

20:02.576 --> 20:05.079
I don't know.
It's hella embarrassing.

20:06.956 --> 20:08.124
[chuckles]

20:09.583 --> 20:10.584
[sighs]

20:13.045 --> 20:16.215
- We totally could have ditched him.
- And then what?

20:16.298 --> 20:17.884
Then we could be off somewhere.

20:17.967 --> 20:20.344
I don't know, we could be fooling around.
Maybe...

20:20.427 --> 20:23.430
I'm just saying.
I always miss all the fun.

20:23.514 --> 20:25.975
I missed the lake.
I missed the riot.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.894
The mass shooter roaming the halls?

20:27.977 --> 20:30.855
Poor you.
Lie there and ride it out.

20:30.938 --> 20:32.374
[whispering] We're all going to die.

20:32.398 --> 20:33.524
Thanks for that.

20:34.275 --> 20:35.818
Why isn't this thing working?

20:35.902 --> 20:39.739
They cut all the phones and TVs
so we couldn't hear the news and get mad.

20:39.822 --> 20:41.532
And that's working great, huh?

20:41.615 --> 20:45.036
What if there's actually an emergency?
Like a fire or something?

20:45.119 --> 20:46.453
Listen to me.
There ain't no fire.

20:46.537 --> 20:48.556
There's a guard out there
going full-on San Bernardino.

20:48.580 --> 20:49.957
This is where you want to be.

20:50.041 --> 20:53.127
Until he bursts in
and we're all sitting ducks.

20:53.210 --> 20:54.295
I'll keep you safe.

20:54.378 --> 20:55.922
I'm so reassured.

20:56.547 --> 20:58.027
[Stratman on radio] <i>Anyone out there?</i>

20:58.549 --> 20:59.735
Hey, man.
You hear about Humps?

20:59.759 --> 21:00.986
<i>That he's gone all Virginia Tech?</i>

21:01.010 --> 21:02.719
<i>It's not good, dude.
Where are you?</i>

21:02.804 --> 21:05.097
Well, I'd rather not say over the walkie,

21:05.181 --> 21:07.224
but I've got half a dozen inmates
on the ground.

21:07.308 --> 21:10.186
We're holding tight.
We gotta get in control of this, man.

21:12.188 --> 21:13.522
[clamoring continues]

21:13.605 --> 21:16.192
Oh, shit. We gotta step it up.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.985
Hey, inmates, on the ground now!

21:18.069 --> 21:19.486
Everyone on the ground, now!

21:19.570 --> 21:20.756
You think they're running from Humps?

21:20.780 --> 21:23.074
I don't know.
I mean, an awful lot of them are smiling.

21:23.157 --> 21:24.509
- [Sankey shrieks]
- Ah! What the fuck?

21:24.533 --> 21:25.534
Oh, absolutely not.

21:25.617 --> 21:27.244
[both grunting]

21:29.080 --> 21:30.539
[groaning]

21:32.792 --> 21:34.251
[groans]

21:35.336 --> 21:37.254
[grunting]

21:37.338 --> 21:38.630
- Hey. No, no, no.
- [shrieks]

21:38.714 --> 21:40.007
Come here! No!

21:40.091 --> 21:41.758
- Oh, fuck.
- [Helen grunts]

21:41.843 --> 21:43.803
You should've shaved it off
like we told you.

21:43.886 --> 21:45.137
Bet you're regretting it now.

21:45.221 --> 21:48.599
I'm not a fucking Nazi skinhead.
I'm a white nationalist.

21:48.682 --> 21:51.102
And you're on the fucking ground,
too, baldy.

21:51.185 --> 21:52.228
We got three.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.355
- [chuckles]
- Whoo! [laughs]

21:54.438 --> 21:55.439
We got three!

21:55.522 --> 21:58.484
I'm locked inside the ghetto bubble.
Everyone's gone crazy.

21:58.567 --> 22:01.153
Is Humps out there really doing
a Charleston, South Carolina?

22:01.237 --> 22:03.072
Where the hell is Caputo?

22:03.155 --> 22:06.283
And when is someone gonna
turn off that daggum alarm?

22:09.286 --> 22:11.705
- [Gina] Come on.
- [banging on door]

22:16.919 --> 22:18.587
Luschek, come...

22:18.670 --> 22:20.006
[Luschek] Go away!

22:28.264 --> 22:31.392
Ugh! And they call me disgusting.

22:33.936 --> 22:36.063
[panting] Let me the fuck in!

22:36.147 --> 22:39.400
It's Aurora, Colorado, out here,
and we're all in the movie theater.

22:39.483 --> 22:42.486
Come on, man, let me in!
Help me!

22:43.905 --> 22:45.031
Oh, fuck.

22:46.991 --> 22:49.743
Okay, we have to cut the alarm.
It's making everyone nuts.

22:49.826 --> 22:51.054
Are you hurt?
Where are you hurt?

22:51.078 --> 22:53.664
Oh. No, I'm fine.
It's period blood. Heavy flow.

22:53.747 --> 22:56.250
[groans in disgust]
Get the fuck out of here, then.

22:56.333 --> 22:58.460
You have to cut the alarm, Luschek.

22:58.544 --> 23:00.504
You don't think I would if I could?

23:00.587 --> 23:02.839
I have sensitive cochlea.
I'm dying in here.

23:02.924 --> 23:05.927
But the only way is with a key,
and only Caputo and Piscatella have keys.

23:06.010 --> 23:07.070
No, that can't be the only way.

23:07.094 --> 23:09.221
Can't we, you know,
cut some wires or something?

23:09.305 --> 23:12.891
We? Piss off, Bloody Mary.
I'm not helping you.

23:12.975 --> 23:14.977
I'm making earplugs out of pencil erasers.

23:15.894 --> 23:20.482
You know, Flores is outside with a shiv,
and I'm closer to the door than you are.

23:21.317 --> 23:23.277
- Flores? You out there?
- [loud banging]

23:24.820 --> 23:27.364
[in Spanish] Where's a fucking hammer
when you need one?

23:27.448 --> 23:29.075
You hear that?

23:29.158 --> 23:33.329
She said she's ready to gut you
like a shark that's eaten a toddler.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.164
[Blanca continues speaking Spanish]

23:37.249 --> 23:38.250
[grunts]

23:47.468 --> 23:48.719
[door opens]

23:51.347 --> 23:55.017
If you're... if you're coming in here
to have sex or whatever,

23:55.101 --> 23:58.604
you can do it, but I'm gonna be here

23:58.687 --> 24:02.066
reading Rilke out loud in German.

24:02.149 --> 24:03.585
Is there anybody else here with you?

24:03.609 --> 24:04.610
No.

24:05.569 --> 24:06.903
Not anymore.

24:06.988 --> 24:09.781
[stammering] I chased them away
with my sadness.

24:09.865 --> 24:12.076
[chuckles] And I'll chase you away, too.

24:12.159 --> 24:14.161
No, well, sad doesn't scare me.

24:15.579 --> 24:17.914
I am staying put until the cavalry comes.

24:17.999 --> 24:20.001
Train has gone way off the tracks
out there.

24:20.084 --> 24:24.380
Oh, yeah,
like it's chugging along in here. [crying]

24:26.215 --> 24:30.136
I... I can't stop crying.

24:31.512 --> 24:33.097
You will.

24:33.180 --> 24:37.851
In this lifetime, you will be amazed
by what you can get over, darling.

24:37.934 --> 24:40.021
Babies get thrown in dumpsters
and survive.

24:41.188 --> 24:43.565
Uh, teenagers crash their cars,

24:43.649 --> 24:46.443
and break their hearts
and OD on coke. They live.

24:46.985 --> 24:50.447
Adults get worn down
and compromise and fail,

24:50.531 --> 24:53.409
and they're still keeping track
of their steps on their cell phones.

24:53.492 --> 24:54.576
[sighs]

24:54.660 --> 24:59.248
We are so fuckin' resilient.
Even when we really don't want to be.

24:59.331 --> 25:02.709
Um... [sighs]
I've already tried to kill myself once.

25:02.793 --> 25:04.878
And you are still here, right?

25:07.256 --> 25:09.841
Not so easy to shake this mortal coil.

25:12.010 --> 25:14.680
Until someone sits on you till you die.

25:17.849 --> 25:19.268
Yes, well...

25:20.477 --> 25:21.853
Yes, there is that.

25:22.938 --> 25:25.023
[objects crashing]

25:26.066 --> 25:28.318
- [alarm continues blaring]
- [inmates clamoring]

25:28.777 --> 25:31.613
[Sankey] Come on,
you're hurting me! Stop!

25:31.697 --> 25:33.157
[Helen] Get your fucking hands off!

25:33.240 --> 25:35.000
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
I don't think so.

25:35.076 --> 25:36.202
[grunts]

25:36.285 --> 25:38.120
[Sankey] No!
No, no, no, please.

25:40.914 --> 25:41.957
[Helen] Motherfucker!

25:43.084 --> 25:45.001
[inmates screaming]

25:48.839 --> 25:50.160
- Uh, that's a lot of them.
- Yep.

25:50.216 --> 25:52.426
- Yeah, we should, uh...
- [inmates clamoring]

25:52.509 --> 25:54.636
We got four of them, right?
Huh? That's enough.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.012
- Yeah, that's plenty.
- Yeah.

25:56.097 --> 25:57.431
[inmate] Tough guy.

25:58.265 --> 25:59.683
Fucking guards.
What's up, bitches?

25:59.766 --> 26:01.352
[chuckles] What you gonna do?

26:03.019 --> 26:04.855
[chuckles nervously]

26:04.938 --> 26:06.064
[sighs]

26:08.234 --> 26:11.069
[sighs] Uh, what do we do now?

26:13.822 --> 26:15.532
[inmates clamoring]

26:19.328 --> 26:21.913
- We get his keys.
- But how?

26:21.997 --> 26:23.582
[scoffs] Distraction.

26:23.665 --> 26:26.460
Show him your tits and I'll get the keys,
and then we run.

26:26.543 --> 26:28.670
Look at this fat guy.
He can't outrun us.

26:29.671 --> 26:31.715
All right. [grunts]

26:35.636 --> 26:36.637
Jesus!

26:36.720 --> 26:39.265
Hey, what you doing on the floor?
Come on. We've taken over.

26:39.348 --> 26:42.101
Yeah, for real.
We got guard hostages and everything.

26:42.184 --> 26:44.895
It's bananas out there.
It's like a party, except terrifying.

26:44.978 --> 26:47.398
Are people getting mass shot
by a mass shooter?

26:47.481 --> 26:49.691
No, someone popped a guard in the leg.
That's it.

26:49.775 --> 26:51.527
All of you, get back down on the floor.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.529
Uh-uh! I'm in charge here.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.447
[yelling]

26:55.531 --> 26:57.324
[clamoring continues]

27:02.120 --> 27:04.165
Nah, I like... I like carpet.
I always have.

27:04.248 --> 27:07.083
Carpet I prefer because it's soft,
for one.

27:07.168 --> 27:08.770
And two, if you drop shit,
it doesn't break.

27:08.794 --> 27:10.546
And also, you don't get splinters.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.256
- And you can munch it.
- Okay.

27:12.339 --> 27:14.007
- [Big Boo laughs]
- Hey.

27:15.967 --> 27:17.010
Oh, Jesus.

27:20.722 --> 27:22.183
How you doing?

27:23.016 --> 27:24.393
You didn't see me.

27:25.852 --> 27:28.314
No, 'course not.

27:29.606 --> 27:30.982
Do you want a snack or something?

27:31.066 --> 27:32.669
Yeah, I'll take some Twizzlers if you got.

27:32.693 --> 27:34.110
Yeah, we have Twizzlers.

27:50.377 --> 27:51.461
Thanks.

27:53.755 --> 27:56.800
You forgot salty.
Now he doesn't have the magic combination.

27:56.884 --> 27:57.885
Idiot.

28:01.012 --> 28:03.056
[inmates clamoring and laughing]

28:03.139 --> 28:06.393
This where you're keeping guards?
We got a big one here for you.

28:06.477 --> 28:08.937
Hey, Daya, we need you again.
We gotta open the door.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.660
Oh, what about Bang Bang?

28:23.744 --> 28:26.013
No, that's the kid from <i>Flintstones.</i>
That's no good. [chuckles]

28:26.037 --> 28:27.248
Oh... [chuckles]

28:28.164 --> 28:29.165
What?

28:29.250 --> 28:31.126
- [chuckles] Nothing.
- Mmm? [chuckles]

28:31.209 --> 28:32.544
You talkin' about me?

28:32.628 --> 28:34.671
We were trying to guess
what your nickname could be

28:34.755 --> 28:36.340
- when you go to Max.
- Mmm.

28:37.799 --> 28:38.967
What are you talking about?

28:39.050 --> 28:42.012
Nothing. I mean,
I think you were totally brave.

28:42.095 --> 28:44.765
You, like, fucked up your whole life
so that we could be free.

28:44.848 --> 28:47.285
And I don't think no one is gonna
mess with you in Max when they hear.

28:47.309 --> 28:50.854
You know how bitches gossip.
Everyone gonna know you a badass.

28:50.937 --> 28:52.981
[gasps] Maybe they call you Badass.

28:53.064 --> 28:55.484
No, a nickname can't be
with "bad" and "ass" in it.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.694
- How about Sexy Ass?
- Uh...

28:57.778 --> 28:59.946
But then no one's gonna know
how hard she is, yo.

29:00.030 --> 29:02.533
- Cold Ass Diaz?
- Get off the ass track.

29:02.616 --> 29:04.868
How about Dominator?
The Dominator.

29:04.951 --> 29:05.952
Too kinky.

29:06.036 --> 29:08.517
You know, you can't keep
shooting things down without pitching.

29:09.415 --> 29:11.041
[breathing heavily]

29:11.750 --> 29:13.544
[alarm continues blaring]

29:23.262 --> 29:26.557
Now, you gonna read the words
just like they written.

29:26.640 --> 29:27.641
You hear me?

29:28.434 --> 29:31.812
No one's gonna be able to hear
with the alarm going off.

29:31.895 --> 29:34.398
- What?
- Exactly.

29:34.481 --> 29:36.400
[inmates clamoring]

29:37.233 --> 29:38.735
Can you stop with the cracking?

29:40.696 --> 29:42.739
- Nope.
- Which wire am I supposed to cut?

29:44.157 --> 29:47.494
Hmm... the blue one.

29:54.209 --> 29:55.461
You're full of shit.

30:07.431 --> 30:09.182
[inmates exclaiming]

30:10.767 --> 30:12.519
- Shit.
- Told ya.

30:14.980 --> 30:16.231
That was the main power.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.775
Then how is this fucking alarm
still ringing?

30:18.859 --> 30:20.694
It's got its own power source.

30:25.491 --> 30:27.701
- [alarm stops]
- [sighs]

30:27.784 --> 30:30.704
[chuckles] See? Blue.

30:32.288 --> 30:33.957
You are such an asshole.

30:34.541 --> 30:36.251
You really gotta learn to trust more.

30:38.128 --> 30:40.964
- [clears throat]
- [Taystee] Okay, we're ready.

30:41.047 --> 30:42.090
He looks shiny.

30:42.173 --> 30:44.926
[clicks tongue]
Man, this ain't a beauty pageant.

30:45.010 --> 30:46.011
Go.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.097
Read.

30:49.180 --> 30:51.558
- [Caputo sighs]
- You best be getting to work.

30:54.770 --> 30:56.522
"Her name was Poussey Washington.

30:56.605 --> 31:00.859
She was kind and loyal, smart...

31:01.777 --> 31:03.987
- and our best librarian."
- [Black Cindy] Hmm.

31:04.070 --> 31:05.822
"She didn't deserve to be in here...

31:07.198 --> 31:11.703
and she definitely didn't
deserve to die in here."

31:11.787 --> 31:12.996
[Black Cindy] Mmm-hmm.

31:16.249 --> 31:17.333
"She..."

31:20.587 --> 31:21.797
I can't say that.

31:25.676 --> 31:26.677
[sniffles]

31:26.760 --> 31:28.011
[exhales heavily]

31:29.430 --> 31:30.722
She was murdered.

31:31.640 --> 31:34.142
CO Bayley murdered her.

31:34.225 --> 31:36.520
And we want justice.

31:45.529 --> 31:48.949
This bathroom is really nice.

31:49.032 --> 31:51.410
It's got that pink soap
that smells like almonds.

31:51.493 --> 31:54.245
[sighs] It's gonna be dark soon.
And no power.

31:54.329 --> 31:56.623
So we need to find a place to hole up.

31:56.707 --> 31:58.417
Ah, you said "hole."

31:58.500 --> 32:00.961
Nice. I'm serious.

32:01.044 --> 32:04.047
Things are gonna go from nuts to insane
around here in the dark.

32:05.424 --> 32:08.677
And you know when this is all over,
there's gonna be a massive investigation.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.805
There's a chance
that someone who's not an idiot

32:11.888 --> 32:14.265
is gonna start asking questions
about that dead guard again.

32:14.349 --> 32:16.602
Stop it.
You're starting to spin out again.

32:16.685 --> 32:19.980
Stop yourself. Come on.
Smell my fingers.

32:20.063 --> 32:21.690
They smell like marzipan.

32:22.733 --> 32:25.276
"Smell my fingers"
is a weird come-on line.

32:25.360 --> 32:26.570
Okay.

32:26.653 --> 32:28.238
Mmm...

32:28.321 --> 32:30.449
Come on my fingers, then?

32:30.532 --> 32:32.242
They're so clean.

32:34.828 --> 32:38.248
Why don't we go try to find a place
where we don't have to stay standing up.

32:39.875 --> 32:41.084
[sighs]

32:42.753 --> 32:43.754
Fine.

32:45.046 --> 32:46.882
[cell phone vibrating]

32:47.841 --> 32:50.010
- At least that fucking alarm went off.
- Mmm-hmm.

32:50.093 --> 32:52.220
- [sighs] It's crazy-making.
- Mmm-hmm.

32:52.303 --> 32:54.014
I'm still hearing a buzzing noise.

32:55.181 --> 32:56.475
Wait.

32:56.558 --> 32:58.184
No, I hear that, too.

33:09.738 --> 33:11.114
Howdy, stranger.

33:12.073 --> 33:14.117
Um... [chuckles nervously]

33:14.200 --> 33:15.911
[inmates clamoring]

33:20.499 --> 33:23.168
[grunts] It's too thick and it's bent.

33:23.251 --> 33:27.297
This needle is for sewing in a hair weave,
not stitching up a gunshot wound.

33:27.380 --> 33:28.632
[grunts]

33:30.383 --> 33:31.635
This isn't gonna work.

33:31.718 --> 33:35.806
Okay, so let's get him back on the cart,
and we'll roll him to medical.

33:36.598 --> 33:38.725
[sighs] No.

33:38.809 --> 33:41.186
You gotta pull it together right now.

33:41.269 --> 33:44.773
Fake it. I don't care.
I can't let this guy die.

33:45.816 --> 33:48.777
So get up,
put one foot in front of the other,

33:48.860 --> 33:52.781
and help me load this sack of shit
back into the cart and roll now.

33:57.285 --> 33:58.286
Bring it closer.

34:01.081 --> 34:02.958
[inmates clamoring]

34:03.041 --> 34:05.121
[Zirconia] It's like I got
all this energy, you know?

34:05.168 --> 34:07.420
[Pidge] Will you slow down?
You got longer legs than me.

34:07.503 --> 34:09.922
[Dwight] No!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

34:10.005 --> 34:11.675
I have to get out of here!

34:11.757 --> 34:13.051
[panting]

34:17.347 --> 34:19.181
[groans]

34:19.264 --> 34:20.350
[laughs] Shit.

34:20.433 --> 34:21.685
[groaning]

34:21.768 --> 34:24.020
I haven't finished securing that side yet.

34:27.523 --> 34:29.735
There. Now it's locked up good.

34:29.818 --> 34:31.652
[continues groaning]

34:32.779 --> 34:33.780
[Blanca] Wait.

34:33.864 --> 34:35.464
[in Spanish]
If you're collecting guards,

34:35.489 --> 34:38.118
there's that one from electrical
hiding out in the front office.

34:38.201 --> 34:39.953
[in English] Guard hunt!

34:40.036 --> 34:41.955
Will you slow down?

34:42.038 --> 34:43.039
[Blanca sighs]

34:57.094 --> 34:58.722
[grunting softly]

35:01.600 --> 35:03.685
[clamoring continues]

35:03.769 --> 35:06.021
We're back!
Hey, who wants some drugs?

35:06.104 --> 35:08.106
- Yum, yummy drugs.
- [Angie] I do.

35:08.189 --> 35:09.608
No, Ang.
We can't let 'em back here.

35:09.691 --> 35:11.735
This is our turf, and we were here first.

35:11.818 --> 35:13.569
- Firsties keepsies!
- [groans]

35:13.654 --> 35:16.114
- But I want drugs!
- Shh.

35:16.197 --> 35:21.662
Okay, I got an idea, all right?
Let's all take a chill pill. Literally.

35:21.745 --> 35:24.414
Now, I'm gonna come in there,
I'm gonna open the gate,

35:24.497 --> 35:26.291
we're all gonna swallow
something wonderful.

35:26.374 --> 35:29.795
And then, we're gonna have
a nice, civilized discussion.

35:29.878 --> 35:31.797
You are not taking any pills.

35:31.880 --> 35:34.841
I know. I know, okay? I won't.
Just... just follow my lead here.

35:34.925 --> 35:37.468
- Okay, but I wanna hold the keys.
- [sighs]

35:37.552 --> 35:38.780
[Leanne] What are you whispering about?

35:38.804 --> 35:40.972
We're talking about
who's gonna hold the keys!

35:41.056 --> 35:42.098
It's me.

35:42.182 --> 35:45.769
[stuttering] I will hold the keys,
I will open the cage,

35:45.852 --> 35:49.773
and I will select a medicine,
and you will all stand aside.

35:49.856 --> 35:50.941
What am I getting?

35:51.024 --> 35:52.943
The strongest benzo you can find.

35:53.026 --> 35:55.528
Bento? Bento?
That... that's a Japanese food.

35:55.611 --> 35:57.113
Okay, fuck it.
New plan.

35:57.197 --> 35:58.198
New plan! New plan!

35:58.281 --> 36:01.284
I will hold the keys,
I will open the cage,

36:01.367 --> 36:04.579
and then Nicky will select something good

36:04.663 --> 36:07.498
because she is very good
at drug selecting.

36:07.582 --> 36:09.042
Oxy! Oxy! Oxy! Oxy!

36:09.125 --> 36:12.087
No! No, no, no, no.
I want that pill that's like super heroin.

36:12.170 --> 36:13.964
We got any of that?
It's fentanyl.

36:14.047 --> 36:15.423
Mmm, I can get the patch.

36:15.506 --> 36:17.092
Or it could be an injectable.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.302
Ooh!
Should we inject stuff?

36:19.385 --> 36:20.887
I bet there's, uh, needles in there.

36:20.971 --> 36:23.431
Excellent idea!
Let's all shoot up.

36:23.514 --> 36:25.058
- Huh?
- [chuckles]

36:26.142 --> 36:28.103
[Nicky] In you go, madame.

36:31.732 --> 36:33.316
Hello! Is anybody here?

36:33.399 --> 36:36.152
Just me. Everyone else has fled.
Talk of a riot.

36:36.236 --> 36:37.396
[Sophia] The rumors are true.

36:37.445 --> 36:40.699
We have a male, early 30s,
gunshot wound to the upper right thigh.

36:40.782 --> 36:41.908
I think they hit a vein.

36:41.992 --> 36:44.619
- How long has he been unconscious?
- He's been in and out.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.681
- And he's lost a lot of blood.
- Thanks for bringing him in.

36:46.705 --> 36:48.790
If you got this,
I'm gonna go check on Daya, okay?

36:48.874 --> 36:51.667
[scoffs] You're gonna need some help.
I was a firema... firefighter.

36:51.752 --> 36:54.170
Well, great.
I'll take all the help I can get.

36:54.254 --> 36:55.964
[inmates clamoring]

36:58.508 --> 37:00.593
Okay, you need to lose the shoes.

37:00.676 --> 37:02.397
The... the deal was for my bag
and my phone,

37:02.470 --> 37:04.555
and I think that that's more than fair.

37:04.639 --> 37:07.600
These were not on sale,
and your feet look much bigger than mine.

37:08.434 --> 37:09.728
You can keep your shoes.

37:09.811 --> 37:12.939
Just hold them, so we can get
to the door faster and quieter.

37:14.649 --> 37:16.442
- These floors look filthy.
- Mmm...

37:16.526 --> 37:18.486
Okay, I'm done.
Piper, give her her shit back.

37:18.569 --> 37:20.280
How did you even get a phone in here?

37:20.363 --> 37:22.908
I put my phone in my underwear
and nail clippers in my pocket

37:22.991 --> 37:24.676
so when I buzzed
through the metal detector,

37:24.700 --> 37:26.501
I was all, "Oh, here,
just keep the clippers."

37:26.536 --> 37:28.139
- And then I just walked right through.
- Oh, my God.

37:28.163 --> 37:29.164
Isn't that clever?
[gasps]

37:31.332 --> 37:33.752
Hey, hold up. She a hostage?

37:35.003 --> 37:36.671
Yeah. Yeah.

37:36.755 --> 37:38.107
Then you should take her to C-Dorm.

37:38.131 --> 37:41.193
They're collectin' all the hostages there.
Easier to manage in bulk, you know?

37:41.217 --> 37:43.929
I'd do it myself,
but this one's a handful. Aren't you?

37:44.012 --> 37:45.013
[grunts]

37:45.096 --> 37:46.573
That's for throwing the scissors
at my head.

37:46.597 --> 37:48.683
- You lucky I got a thick skull.
- [chuckles]

37:48.767 --> 37:51.477
- That's me, lucky.
- Hey, can I have her jacket?

37:52.896 --> 37:54.940
- Give her your jacket.
- What? No, it...

37:55.023 --> 37:57.650
It goes with my dress.
It's an outfit.

37:57.733 --> 38:00.320
It makes you look boxy,
so give it up.

38:03.364 --> 38:05.033
It was really hiding your waist.

38:06.576 --> 38:07.953
[Linda] Oh, um, I'm sorry.

38:08.036 --> 38:09.996
I, uh... [chuckles]

38:11.581 --> 38:13.458
Should we take the shoes, too?

38:13.541 --> 38:16.294
Maybe to use the heels for weapons,
but not to wear.

38:16.377 --> 38:18.964
They represent the patriarchy
and the oppression of women.

38:19.047 --> 38:20.423
And they hurt like fuck.

38:21.341 --> 38:22.633
The shoes, too.

38:22.717 --> 38:24.344
We called them.
We called the shoes.

38:25.220 --> 38:26.512
Don't make me come over there.

38:26.596 --> 38:28.139
Take them. Take the shoes.

38:28.223 --> 38:29.891
'Kay. See ya.

38:29.975 --> 38:31.309
But, uh...

38:32.643 --> 38:34.288
[Pidge] We should have
grabbed that bag, too.

38:34.312 --> 38:35.563
[Zirconia] Later.

38:38.900 --> 38:39.901
[Taystee] <i>Shit.</i>

38:39.985 --> 38:43.071
Man, it locked again.
How do you unlock it?

38:45.323 --> 38:47.408
Okay! All right. All right. Uh...

38:47.492 --> 38:50.536
The number six,
lowercase "p," capital "K,"

38:50.620 --> 38:52.998
lowercase "a," "b," "s."

38:53.081 --> 38:54.249
[Black Cindy] Six pack abs?

38:54.332 --> 38:56.835
Ooh, I wanna see those.

38:56.918 --> 39:00.505
All right, so... how do I post it?

39:01.422 --> 39:02.883
Man, where do I post it?

39:02.966 --> 39:06.136
I got an old Myspace account.
Still might work.

39:06.219 --> 39:08.221
- [Taystee sighs]
- [Alison] Snapchat.

39:08.304 --> 39:10.932
- I hear it's all about Snapchat now.
- [scoffs]

39:11.975 --> 39:14.978
What?
Why'd you make that snort noise?

39:16.021 --> 39:19.900
Snapchat is a closed system,
and it only lasts a limited time.

39:19.983 --> 39:22.485
But if you tweet
with a hashtag and a link,

39:22.568 --> 39:25.113
it goes to Facebook, Instagram, etcetera.

39:25.196 --> 39:26.990
Really increases
your chance of going viral.

39:27.073 --> 39:28.074
Hmm.

39:28.158 --> 39:30.493
You're gonna want
a quick, catchy clickbait.

39:30.576 --> 39:33.204
All right, something to really grab
the liberal market.

39:33.288 --> 39:35.916
- That's who you want to appeal to.
- Why are you helping them?

39:35.999 --> 39:38.084
Because their message
still exonerates MCC,

39:38.168 --> 39:39.377
so what the hell do I care?

39:39.460 --> 39:43.506
Bad apple guard. Sympathetic victim.
Justice will be served.

39:43.589 --> 39:45.860
That's what I've been trying to convey
since the beginning.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.510
He was a kid who was under-trained,

39:47.593 --> 39:51.514
in over his head,
who made a grave and terrible mistake.

39:51.597 --> 39:53.892
See, that's not good for MCC.

39:53.975 --> 39:56.394
He was a kid who killed my friend.

39:56.477 --> 39:58.521
My friend, who was a person,

39:58.604 --> 40:01.107
and you didn't say her name
or nothing about her.

40:01.191 --> 40:02.984
I know.

40:03.068 --> 40:04.694
I know, and that was wrong,

40:04.777 --> 40:08.531
but I was trying to prevent one tragedy
from becoming two.

40:09.782 --> 40:11.367
Taystee, what's your endgame here?

40:11.451 --> 40:13.078
How long do you think you can keep us?

40:13.161 --> 40:14.555
They're gonna notice
you're missing during count.

40:14.579 --> 40:15.681
They're gonna come looking for you.

40:15.705 --> 40:17.623
[laughs] "Count."
That's funny.

40:17.707 --> 40:19.875
- There ain't no count.
- [Janae and Alison chuckle]

40:19.960 --> 40:23.296
- We in charge now.
- Mmm-hmm.

40:23.379 --> 40:24.505
What are you talking about?

40:24.589 --> 40:26.967
Oh, shit. He don't know.

40:27.050 --> 40:30.971
Why you think the alarm was going off,
and the lights and everything?

40:31.054 --> 40:32.055
Riot.

40:33.556 --> 40:35.558
Okay, upload this on the Twitter.

40:37.768 --> 40:38.894
You need an account.

40:38.979 --> 40:40.480
Do it on yours!

40:41.356 --> 40:43.649
How long do you think
this riot of yours can last?

40:44.275 --> 40:45.776
As long as it takes.

40:45.860 --> 40:47.820
For what to happen, exactly?

40:47.903 --> 40:50.406
- I don't know, for Bayley to get arrested.
- [Janae] Mmm-hmm.

40:50.490 --> 40:52.343
- For the guards to get fired.
- [Janae and Alison] Mmm-hmm.

40:52.367 --> 40:54.953
- For the food to get better.
- Mmm.

40:55.036 --> 40:59.499
For classes and better jobs,
and maybe, like, basic dignity.

40:59.582 --> 41:00.791
[Janae] Mmm-hmm.

41:00.875 --> 41:02.293
We should write this shit down.

41:02.377 --> 41:03.669
Not good for MCC.

41:03.753 --> 41:07.840
Barring the arrest...
I hope you get everything you want.

41:07.923 --> 41:10.135
I've never been able
to make a difference here.

41:10.218 --> 41:11.761
Maybe you'll have better luck.

41:12.678 --> 41:14.055
Maybe so.

41:14.139 --> 41:16.724
[Caputo] But if you know anything
about the history of riots,

41:16.807 --> 41:18.851
you know they don't end well.

41:18.934 --> 41:20.770
- They never end well.
- [Janae] Uh-uh.

41:20.853 --> 41:22.188
We, we're gonna get it done.

41:22.272 --> 41:24.149
I hope you do.

41:24.232 --> 41:26.859
Uh, I really have to pee.

41:26.942 --> 41:28.278
Oh, I can help you with that.

41:28.361 --> 41:31.114
See, just come up with a catchy tweet,
get our video out,

41:31.197 --> 41:32.240
I give you my cup here.

41:32.323 --> 41:34.534
You know, this was delicious, by the way.

41:34.617 --> 41:37.745
You know, a hint of cinnamon,
vanilla bean. Delightful!

41:37.828 --> 41:38.829
Hey.

41:40.206 --> 41:42.250
Uh, anyone mind if I drink this one, too?

41:42.333 --> 41:44.294
You've had enough caffeine.

41:44.377 --> 41:45.503
[scoffing]

41:45.586 --> 41:48.923
All right.
Go to my bag, get my hotspot.

41:49.007 --> 41:50.175
I'll upload for you.

41:51.217 --> 41:56.139
Now, would somebody please untie my hands
so that I can type and hold my own dick?

41:56.222 --> 41:58.058
[clicks tongue] Oh, come on.
You no fun.

42:00.060 --> 42:01.686
[inmates clamoring]

42:01.769 --> 42:03.521
[sobbing]

42:03.604 --> 42:06.899
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

42:13.989 --> 42:16.076
She's starting to lose it. [sighs]

42:16.159 --> 42:17.993
You think we can break out of here?

42:18.994 --> 42:21.164
I don't see how right now,

42:21.247 --> 42:24.875
but... it's good
that they're falling apart.

42:24.959 --> 42:27.045
That alarm was going off forever.

42:27.128 --> 42:30.965
Someone'll come soon.
Max guards. Police, maybe.

42:31.882 --> 42:35.178
- SWAT.
- Sure. Of course.

42:36.304 --> 42:37.472
Are you scared?

42:39.099 --> 42:40.933
I'm not not scared.

42:41.892 --> 42:43.478
[grunts] Me, too.

42:43.561 --> 42:44.687
Not not.

42:50.485 --> 42:51.694
Don't do that.

42:54.947 --> 42:56.616
- Hey! You!
- [bangs door]

42:56.699 --> 42:58.993
You on that side.
You on the other side.

42:59.077 --> 43:00.703
Stay away from each other.

43:00.786 --> 43:02.264
And I don't wanna hear
no talking between you.

43:02.288 --> 43:04.957
You got that? Huh?
You got it?

43:08.961 --> 43:10.630
Daya, look.

43:10.713 --> 43:12.840
You can't let these guards
see you like this.

43:13.758 --> 43:16.886
You either gotta pull your shit together,
or give me the gun.

43:18.804 --> 43:20.390
Okay, give me the gun.

43:22.517 --> 43:23.768
Come on.

43:25.103 --> 43:26.146
It's time.

43:26.229 --> 43:27.897
Get the fuck away from me!

43:27.980 --> 43:30.191
Everybody get the fuck away from me!

43:33.486 --> 43:35.405
The fuck is happening here?

43:36.781 --> 43:37.990
Fuck.

43:38.073 --> 43:39.450
[both snoring]

43:40.368 --> 43:42.120
[Lorna] So what now?

43:42.203 --> 43:45.331
Now we hold tight, yeah?

43:45.415 --> 43:48.543
The day is done.
The battle is won. [sniffles]

43:49.877 --> 43:51.546
Speaking of holding tight.

43:51.629 --> 43:53.964
Hey, back off, eyeballs.

43:54.048 --> 43:55.383
What?

43:55.466 --> 43:56.842
[gasps] Oh!

43:56.926 --> 43:59.304
I'm talking about the keys to the cage.

43:59.387 --> 44:01.365
Oh, wait, so you thought
I was talking about something else?

44:01.389 --> 44:02.932
[chuckles]

44:03.015 --> 44:05.976
You see... you... you have
a mental picture in your head, right?

44:06.060 --> 44:08.521
Of me holding you tight.

44:09.439 --> 44:10.981
And close.

44:11.065 --> 44:12.442
Oh, it was about the keys?

44:12.525 --> 44:13.693
- The keys?
- Mmm-hmm.

44:14.610 --> 44:18.198
Which, by the way,
you are never going to get.

44:18.281 --> 44:19.657
Oh, yeah?

44:19.740 --> 44:22.785
Even if you have to hide them
some place very private?

44:23.953 --> 44:26.831
And warm. [sighs]
And wet.

44:26.914 --> 44:28.166
Oh, shit.

44:29.292 --> 44:30.376
Where are you going?

44:30.460 --> 44:33.963
Well, now I have to find
some other place to hide them, don't I?

44:39.927 --> 44:41.554
[monitor beeping]

44:49.354 --> 44:51.647
[Adarsh] Is that really necessary?

44:51.731 --> 44:53.649
He brought a gun into the prison.

44:53.733 --> 44:56.853
We could have been looking at a Fort Hood
situation if he had not been disarmed

44:56.902 --> 44:58.070
and shot.

44:58.153 --> 44:59.322
I see.

45:00.323 --> 45:01.532
I think we did good work.

45:02.283 --> 45:03.409
I agree.

45:20.885 --> 45:22.595
[breathes deeply]

45:31.228 --> 45:33.230
<i>"She didn't deserve to be in here...</i>

45:35.358 --> 45:38.068
<i>and she definitely didn't
deserve to die in here."</i>

45:40.237 --> 45:41.364
<i>I can't say that.</i>

45:42.197 --> 45:43.408
[exhales heavily]

45:44.784 --> 45:46.702
<i>She was murdered.</i>

45:46.786 --> 45:48.663
<i>CO Bayley murdered her.</i>

45:48.746 --> 45:51.749
- [sighs]
<i>- And we want justice.</i>

45:51.832 --> 45:54.001
- [indistinct chatter]
- [cell phone chimes]

45:59.173 --> 46:01.091
<i>"Her name was Poussey Washington.</i>

46:01.175 --> 46:03.469
<i>- She was kind and loyal..."</i>
- [scoffs]

46:03.553 --> 46:05.305
<i>- "...smart..."</i>
- I knew it.

46:06.306 --> 46:08.223
<i>- "...and our best librarian."</i>
- I knew it.

46:09.141 --> 46:10.851
[inmates clamoring]

46:12.770 --> 46:14.814
Oh, my God.
Will you stop following us?

46:14.897 --> 46:16.649
We tried.
You're on your own.

46:16.732 --> 46:18.294
Please. Please,
I was only in for a meeting.

46:18.318 --> 46:20.653
Please, I don't want to be a hostage
or somebody's bitch.

46:20.736 --> 46:23.072
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Please help me. Please.

46:23.155 --> 46:24.907
She's gonna be someone's bitch so fast.

46:24.990 --> 46:26.784
- [crying]
- Maybe we should help her.

46:26.867 --> 46:27.868
What?

46:27.952 --> 46:30.112
What happened to staying out of trouble
and laying low?

46:30.162 --> 46:32.623
You have, what, three months left?

46:32.707 --> 46:36.043
And God forbid my face ends up on TV
when this thing gets bigger.

46:36.127 --> 46:38.296
We need to hide and ride it out.

46:38.379 --> 46:41.590
- There is a puddle of blood on the floor.
- But she's so pathetic.

46:41.674 --> 46:44.344
- [sighs]
- She reminds me of me.

46:45.094 --> 46:47.054
How I was, but more annoying.

46:47.137 --> 46:49.557
And I never wore suits
or worked for a big corporation.

46:49.640 --> 46:53.478
And she's older.
Look, Al, I don't want to not lay low,

46:53.561 --> 46:55.771
but I also don't want to lose my humanity.

46:57.272 --> 46:58.273
Again.

46:59.191 --> 47:01.110
I'm in an amends
for bad behavior phase.

47:05.030 --> 47:06.031
Fine.

47:06.657 --> 47:09.494
But the minute she gets risky for us,
we are ditching her ass.

47:09.577 --> 47:10.911
- Okay.
- Get changed.

47:10.995 --> 47:13.706
Welcome to Litchfield, inmate... [sighs]

47:14.624 --> 47:15.666
Ibrahim?

47:16.584 --> 47:18.335
No, you need to make up a different name.

47:18.419 --> 47:19.504
Amelia Von Barlow.

47:19.587 --> 47:20.921
You had that ready to go.

47:21.005 --> 47:22.382
I once wrote a novella.

47:23.215 --> 47:25.510
Get your pants on, Von Barlow,

47:25.593 --> 47:27.052
and find some boots.

47:27.136 --> 47:29.472
And yes, you will definitely
be getting athlete's foot.

47:30.723 --> 47:32.767
[sniffs] Is this vomit?

47:32.850 --> 47:34.143
Um...

47:35.144 --> 47:37.312
[sniffs] No.

47:37.397 --> 47:39.524
Prison slop.
Yesterday's dinner, I'm guessing.

47:39.607 --> 47:41.084
It's an easy mistake to make, though.

47:41.108 --> 47:42.568
Hmm. Okay.

47:46.030 --> 47:47.448
- Captain?
- [inmates clamoring]

47:47.532 --> 47:50.117
[inmate 1] You suck!
Fuck that bullshit!

47:53.538 --> 47:55.581
[inmate 2] You coming out,
or we coming in?

47:58.375 --> 48:00.210
[inmate 3] Get out here and suck my dick!

48:01.128 --> 48:03.881
- [inmates clamoring]
- [inmate 4] Get out, motherfucker.

48:06.383 --> 48:07.510
Put him with the others.

48:07.593 --> 48:09.094
- Move, motherfucker!
- [straining]

48:09.178 --> 48:11.180
- Piece of shit.
- Line him up!

48:11.263 --> 48:12.389
You pat him down?

48:12.473 --> 48:13.933
A lot.

48:14.016 --> 48:16.226
All the doors to the outside are secure.

48:16.310 --> 48:18.646
Whoa, I need to lie down.

48:18.729 --> 48:20.690
Wake me up if there's shit happening.

48:20.773 --> 48:22.483
[sighs] Nice shoes.

48:24.026 --> 48:26.821
- We got any more COs out there?
- I got people looking.

48:26.904 --> 48:29.144
I bet they all ran away
before Blanca got the doors done.

48:29.990 --> 48:31.033
[feedback over radio]

48:31.784 --> 48:32.785
Maybe not.

48:32.868 --> 48:34.829
[Stratman on radio] <i>Anybody out there?</i>

48:34.912 --> 48:37.457
<i>Dixon? McCullough?
Do you copy?</i>

48:37.540 --> 48:38.791
<i>Caputo?</i>

48:39.584 --> 48:43.170
Hello? Isn't it, like,
time for dinner or something?

48:43.253 --> 48:44.421
I'm hungry.

48:44.505 --> 48:45.881
Anybody?

48:46.841 --> 48:47.842
Nothing.

48:49.259 --> 48:51.679
[sighs] I don't know
what the fuck's going on.

48:51.762 --> 48:53.848
They're all out there
plotting your deaths.

48:53.931 --> 48:55.641
Shut the fuck up!

48:58.686 --> 49:01.230
[Red chuckles]
Competitive table setting?

49:01.313 --> 49:03.608
[Ginsberg] Tablescape.
It's called tablescape.

49:03.691 --> 49:05.651
[both chuckling]

49:05.735 --> 49:07.570
- Hey.
- [Ginsberg] Oh, hello.

49:07.653 --> 49:09.321
[Red] We're in here.

49:09.404 --> 49:10.948
You know if the phone works?

49:11.031 --> 49:13.408
- [grunts] Oh!
- [chuckles]

49:13.493 --> 49:14.660
Merry Christmas.

49:14.744 --> 49:17.538
It does.
You need to leave now.

49:17.622 --> 49:19.665
We're kind of in the middle
of something, huh?

49:19.749 --> 49:21.584
- Yeah. [chuckles]
- [chuckling]

49:24.712 --> 49:28.173
We can do this later.
Do you mind if we take this with us?

49:29.091 --> 49:30.635
And... and these?

49:30.718 --> 49:33.804
Do whatever you want.
Just get out now.

49:33.888 --> 49:35.406
- [Ginsberg] Getting... getting out.
- [Red grunting]

49:35.430 --> 49:38.100
[Ginsberg] Okay, going.
Thank you.

49:47.484 --> 49:50.445
- [line ringing]
- Come on, Ma.

49:51.781 --> 49:53.115
- [phone beeps]
- Pick up. Ma?

49:53.198 --> 49:55.358
[Aleida] <i>Hello, you've reached</i>
<i>Aleida's phone, bitches.</i>

49:55.409 --> 49:56.661
<i>- Leave a message.</i>
- [grunts]

50:04.334 --> 50:06.211
