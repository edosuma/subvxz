WEBVTT

00:46.880 --> 00:48.146
- Who is it?

00:57.891 --> 00:59.290
Who is it?

01:34.327 --> 01:35.794
- No, no.

01:38.298 --> 01:39.197
No.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.133
- Wendy?

01:42.235 --> 01:43.902
- I need, no, now.
- It's Dr. Parrish.

01:46.740 --> 01:48.306
We're so glad you're back.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.847
We were all so
worried about you.

02:10.997 --> 02:14.332
Can you tell me
what's bothering you?

02:16.970 --> 02:17.969
You're safe.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.237
It's okay.

02:20.340 --> 02:21.440
You can talk to me.

02:23.477 --> 02:24.776
I believe you.

02:28.348 --> 02:30.315
Do you wanna tell me what it is?

02:31.284 --> 02:32.317
It's okay.

02:34.354 --> 02:35.253
Okay.

02:36.456 --> 02:37.956
Okay.

02:37.958 --> 02:38.958
Maybe tomorrow.

02:44.297 --> 02:45.396
- Tortured.

02:47.367 --> 02:49.534
They were so, so scared.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.303
They needed my help.

02:52.305 --> 02:53.404
They needed my help.

02:53.406 --> 02:55.006
- Who needed your help?

03:12.392 --> 03:15.059
- She's
going to get ya.

03:19.432 --> 03:21.533
Wait.

03:21.535 --> 03:22.667
Don't go.

03:22.669 --> 03:25.336
Twins, twin, they were twins.

03:25.338 --> 03:26.338
- Twins?

03:27.507 --> 03:28.640
Wendy, are you sure?

03:31.278 --> 03:32.211
- It's okay.

03:34.714 --> 03:36.414
I can, I can help you.

03:40.086 --> 03:41.352
It's okay.

03:41.354 --> 03:42.287
It's okay.

04:04.678 --> 04:05.844
- Wendy?

04:08.615 --> 04:09.681
Wendy?

04:13.420 --> 04:14.519
Them?

04:17.023 --> 04:19.423
Wendy, please, take a look.

04:19.426 --> 04:20.825
Are these the twins you saw?

04:29.502 --> 04:30.735
And her.

05:50.650 --> 05:52.116
- You're filling in for Greg?

05:52.118 --> 05:54.986
- Yeah, night watch right?

05:54.988 --> 05:56.187
I'm Matt.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.789
- This is the office.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.057
There's the security system.

05:59.059 --> 06:02.527
You sit here, drink
coffee, don't leave.

06:03.863 --> 06:04.802
- Cool.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.133
They really cleaned
this place up, huh?

06:10.236 --> 06:12.503
Do you know I used to
come here with the boys?

06:12.505 --> 06:14.238
Back when they
boarded the school up.

06:15.542 --> 06:18.042
You know, I reckon I could
still find those gnarly places.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.510
- Well, you're
not gonna find out

06:19.512 --> 06:22.113
because Dr. Parrish is
paying you to sit here,

06:22.115 --> 06:23.514
drink coffee--

06:23.516 --> 06:25.450
- And not leave.

06:25.452 --> 06:26.184
I know.

06:30.156 --> 06:34.559
So, Institute for Occult Study.

06:35.862 --> 06:37.628
That code for nuthouse, huh?

06:38.765 --> 06:39.998
- They're not nuts.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.534
Or crazy or psycho
or any other term

06:43.536 --> 06:44.836
you may have heard around town.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.838
They have a gift.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.606
It's a gift that takes a toll.

06:49.776 --> 06:52.276
We have the ability
to see the occult.

06:52.278 --> 06:56.848
- Wait, you're telling me
that they can see ghosts?

06:56.850 --> 07:00.018
- Yes, and it's something
you could never handle.

07:01.554 --> 07:02.687
- So if you wanna work here

07:02.689 --> 07:04.288
you need to show
compassion and respect.

07:04.290 --> 07:05.156
Deborah.

07:10.964 --> 07:14.632
This is who Wendy identified.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.704
- The Dahl twins?

07:19.706 --> 07:20.805
But why would they come back?

07:20.807 --> 07:22.573
The Sanders are dead.

07:22.575 --> 07:27.678
- Because the twins
weren't alone out there.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.550
The question is

07:35.221 --> 07:36.621
why would she come back?

08:03.583 --> 08:05.650
- Jordan.

08:11.257 --> 08:12.757
Jordan, Jordan.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.601
- Anne again?

08:26.039 --> 08:28.339
When are you gonna talk
to someone already?

08:28.341 --> 08:30.007
It's been five years.

08:30.009 --> 08:31.175
It's only gonna get worse.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.643
- What's a normal amount of time

08:32.645 --> 08:34.312
to get over someone
trying to kill you?

08:34.313 --> 08:35.813
Four?

08:35.815 --> 08:37.615
- Up.

08:37.616 --> 08:39.817
God, you guys passed out early.

08:39.818 --> 08:42.120
I've been watching you
both sleep for hours.

08:43.188 --> 08:44.689
Kidding, Larry.

08:47.927 --> 08:49.927
Do you guys have any
idea how hard it is

08:49.929 --> 08:52.063
to get people to
follow you on The Gram?

08:52.065 --> 08:54.732
If you're not showing
side boob, nobody cares.

08:54.734 --> 08:56.234
- You seem to.
- Well, yeah,

08:56.236 --> 08:59.003
you know how much money you
can make from this thing.

08:59.005 --> 09:00.771
Of course.
- Ah, if I let you share

09:00.773 --> 09:03.741
my story, you'll be sleeping
on piles of hundreds

09:03.743 --> 09:05.176
instead of on these
crappy dorm mattresses?

09:05.178 --> 09:06.677
- Jordan, come on.

09:06.679 --> 09:08.312
People would eat it up.

09:08.314 --> 09:10.047
Life threatened by
your aunt and uncle.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.817
A pair of ghostly
twins at your side.

09:12.819 --> 09:14.852
And the last second,
an unlikely hero

09:14.854 --> 09:17.054
swoops in and saves the day.

09:18.791 --> 09:20.658
Very unlikely hero.

09:20.660 --> 09:22.693
- Um, guys?

09:23.696 --> 09:24.862
Ah.

09:28.668 --> 09:30.701
- Okay, if you
won't do Instagram

09:30.703 --> 09:33.671
then I'll just have to go
back to doing sexy videos.

09:33.673 --> 09:35.206
Know anyone with a camera?

09:36.409 --> 09:38.409
- Oh, hey.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.711
Anyone up to anything?
- Trevor, what did I tell you

09:40.713 --> 09:41.846
about listening at my door?

09:41.848 --> 09:43.114
- I wasn't listening
at the door.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.282
- Sorry for you, Trev.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.469
- I, I heard screaming.

09:48.470 --> 09:50.687
I heard a distinct
British accent screaming.

09:50.690 --> 09:53.691
- Trevor, get out,
stop being a creep.

09:53.693 --> 09:54.358
- I'm not a creep.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.394
I'm a concerned citizen.

09:56.396 --> 09:58.362
You know, one day I'm gonna
burst through the door

09:58.364 --> 10:01.149
and it will be to the rescue,

10:01.150 --> 10:03.935
and then you'll all be
glad to see me then.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.836
- Out.
- You know what, someday.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.705
Someday.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.475
- He's pretty much obsessed
with Zoe right now.

10:11.477 --> 10:13.811
- Scary annoying.

10:13.813 --> 10:16.948
A bit like you,
Larry.

10:20.253 --> 10:22.720
- Yeah, I'm gonna go.

10:26.259 --> 10:28.092
- Hey, Larry, you're
not really upset right?

10:28.094 --> 10:29.393
We were just joking.

10:31.297 --> 10:32.463
- I'm not gonna
be able to pretend

10:32.465 --> 10:34.999
everything's okay forever.

10:35.001 --> 10:38.903
Those dreams, your mood, you're
having problems sleeping.

10:39.772 --> 10:41.138
You need to talk to someone.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.007
- The son of two shrinks
thinks psychology's the answer?

10:43.009 --> 10:44.742
I'm shocked.

10:44.744 --> 10:47.845
- I know you had some bad
experiences with my dad.

10:47.847 --> 10:48.946
But my mom is different.

10:48.948 --> 10:51.749
Your story is the reason
she started the institute.

10:51.751 --> 10:53.901
She wants to help you.

10:53.902 --> 10:56.052
- Let me guess, she thinks
I'm just like her patients?

10:56.055 --> 10:57.888
- You wore that
ring a long time.

10:59.859 --> 11:01.892
And all the time
was with the twins.

11:03.796 --> 11:07.031
Don't you think that
it might be possible

11:07.967 --> 11:09.100
that it effected you?

11:11.271 --> 11:12.803
- So what, I check
into the institute

11:12.805 --> 11:14.071
with the rest of the crazies?

11:18.911 --> 11:22.280
Wait is, is that
what she said to you?

11:24.550 --> 11:27.918
- Jordan, I know you're afraid,

11:29.355 --> 11:31.889
but how long are you gonna
keep running from this?

11:34.460 --> 11:35.326
- You're right.

11:36.396 --> 11:37.295
You should go.

11:55.882 --> 11:56.881
- Oh, shit.

12:05.124 --> 12:06.324
Holy shit.

12:08.928 --> 12:10.795
Oh, cool, cool, cool.

12:10.797 --> 12:11.529
This is dope.

12:13.099 --> 12:13.964
Oh, shit.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.235
This place is so cool.

12:38.858 --> 12:39.857
Oh, my god.

12:43.629 --> 12:46.230
No, no, no, no.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.657
Oh, come on, man.

13:16.062 --> 13:18.195
- No, don't worry.

13:18.197 --> 13:21.132
- Hey, come on, it's
too late for this crap.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.266
- She's here, she's here!

13:22.268 --> 13:23.634
- Look, there's no one here.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.569
- This is what she wants.

13:25.571 --> 13:28.639
Before she's strong, she
needs us to do things for her.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.474
- Okay, yeah, I need you
to do something for me.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.209
Let's go to bed, okay?
- No, you don't understand

13:32.211 --> 13:33.377
why she's here.

13:33.379 --> 13:34.979
- There's no one here.
- She, she needs

13:34.981 --> 13:36.280
someone to help her.

13:37.383 --> 13:38.916
- They, they, they.
- Okay, you know what?

13:38.918 --> 13:40.451
It's time for bed now.
- She's in control.

13:40.452 --> 13:41.985
She's trying to get back.
- Go to bed, I'm sorry, Lady,

13:41.988 --> 13:44.655
- She's back!
- But it's time to go to bed.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.424
Nut job, really.

13:46.426 --> 13:48.492
Jesus Christ, man.

13:49.662 --> 13:52.029
Matt, take this job, it's
easy, you sit in an office.

13:52.031 --> 13:53.664
Oh, and you deal
with crazy people.

13:57.136 --> 14:00.971
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

14:03.042 --> 14:04.675
- Boo.

14:07.980 --> 14:09.246
- Jack, right?

14:09.248 --> 14:10.681
Come on, man, don't do anything.

14:10.683 --> 14:13.117
- Crazy, he
won't, but I will.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.074
- How did this
guy get out of this room?

14:37.076 --> 14:39.243
- I don't know,
he was locked in,

14:39.245 --> 14:41.345
and my mom is the only
one with the keys.

14:43.282 --> 14:44.582
Jordan?
- I didn't say it.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.317
- Well you didn't have to.

14:46.318 --> 14:48.051
- Well how else do you
get through a locked door?

14:48.054 --> 14:48.752
- I don't know.

14:48.754 --> 14:50.054
Lots of ways.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.723
Lots of not ghost ways.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.158
- What, was he a magician?

14:54.160 --> 14:56.126
- Well he did have
a cape and top hat.

15:01.334 --> 15:03.567
This is nice.

15:05.171 --> 15:06.203
I miss nice.

15:09.008 --> 15:10.174
Come back with me.

15:12.345 --> 15:13.777
- To Silver Falls?

15:13.779 --> 15:17.047
- Well, my bags
are, are in the car.

15:17.049 --> 15:18.782
We get you packed
up and ready to go.

15:18.784 --> 15:20.284
This semester is basically over,

15:20.286 --> 15:22.653
so we can take that trip
we always wanted to.

15:22.655 --> 15:23.554
- Not there.

15:25.091 --> 15:29.760
- Jordan, this guy,
Jack, he's on the loose.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.095
My mom is stubborn.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.229
She won't leave.

15:32.231 --> 15:34.098
And she likes you.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.300
So maybe the two of us
can go and convince her.

15:37.336 --> 15:39.203
- I left that
place for a reason.

15:40.406 --> 15:43.140
Why in the world
would I wanna go back?

15:43.142 --> 15:44.041
- Me.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.812
- Larry, the last time
I barely made it out.

15:50.449 --> 15:51.348
- But you did.

15:53.152 --> 15:54.051
Because of me.

17:19.905 --> 17:21.171
- Jordan?

17:21.173 --> 17:22.271
- What are you doing?

17:22.273 --> 17:24.174
You make Larry go all the
way back to Silver Falls

17:24.175 --> 17:26.175
just to convince you to leave?

17:26.178 --> 17:28.145
- I didn't ask
Larry to come here,

17:28.146 --> 17:31.148
but I can't leave right now.

17:31.150 --> 17:33.317
Not until I convince
the authorities.

17:33.319 --> 17:37.454
My patient, he didn't
kill that boy on his own.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.159
- What do you mean?

17:43.562 --> 17:45.863
- I wasn't going to say
anything until I was sure,

17:45.865 --> 17:48.532
but I think Anne's back.

17:49.869 --> 17:51.535
She's using Jack.

17:51.537 --> 17:53.203
The way the twins used you.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.206
- That's impossible.
- Impossible?

17:56.842 --> 17:58.375
You sound like my ex-husband.

17:59.745 --> 18:03.213
Jordan, isn't it true

18:04.250 --> 18:06.350
that you've been
seeing certain things?

18:09.221 --> 18:09.953
- No.

18:11.257 --> 18:12.690
- That's
not what I heard.

18:14.527 --> 18:17.227
- Look, I'm, I'm not
like your patients.

18:17.229 --> 18:18.262
I'm not crazy.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.230
- My patients aren't crazy.

18:21.834 --> 18:24.935
They're just, they're
overwhelmed with their gift

18:24.937 --> 18:27.371
but if you could embrace yours.

18:30.209 --> 18:33.343
Look, don't you
wanna know for sure?

18:34.246 --> 18:37.347
I can email you a
video of that night.

18:37.349 --> 18:38.916
It could give you your answer.

18:44.690 --> 18:45.789
Jordan?

18:48.594 --> 18:49.493
Jordan?

18:53.332 --> 18:54.965
- Are we running
an ice cream store in here?

18:54.967 --> 18:58.635
- Ah, I
forget to bring in wood.

18:58.637 --> 19:00.971
I'm sorry, honey, I
wasn't expecting company.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.373
I'll--
- Ah, I'll, I'll get it.

19:04.343 --> 19:07.010
- Oh, um, Jordan called.

19:08.614 --> 19:09.813
You should talk to her.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.450
- I don't need your
relationship advice, Mom.

19:18.023 --> 19:20.891
- Just see where you'll end up.

20:15.648 --> 20:18.315
Hmm.

20:30.863 --> 20:33.397
- No more, no more.

20:52.852 --> 20:57.921
More, no more.

22:17.369 --> 22:18.101
- Kill someone?

22:19.438 --> 22:20.771
Running from the cops?

22:20.773 --> 22:22.205
- Hey--
- Wait.

22:22.207 --> 22:24.474
If you are don't say
anything, just blink twice.

22:25.945 --> 22:27.577
- Larry's missing.

22:28.514 --> 22:29.379
- What?

22:29.381 --> 22:30.113
Is he?

22:31.583 --> 22:32.916
- They're looking for him.

22:34.453 --> 22:35.552
- You're going back
to Silver Falls?

22:35.554 --> 22:36.486
- I have to.

22:36.488 --> 22:38.588
If there's anything I can do.

22:38.590 --> 22:42.192
Zoe, she's back.

22:43.562 --> 22:44.461
- Who?

22:45.064 --> 22:45.963
- Anne.

22:46.732 --> 22:47.998
- Dead Anne?
- That's okay,

22:48.000 --> 22:49.533
I wouldn't believe me either.

22:56.008 --> 22:58.976
What are you doing?
- Um, packing for no reason.

22:58.978 --> 22:59.810
- Zoe, no.

22:59.812 --> 23:01.812
- First of all, yes.

23:01.814 --> 23:04.881
Second of all,
Larry's my friend too.

23:04.883 --> 23:07.584
And third, do you know
how many followers I get

23:07.586 --> 23:09.252
if I post a real
ghost to Instagram?

23:10.089 --> 23:12.689
- Um, thanks.

23:12.691 --> 23:14.124
- Don't mention it.

23:14.126 --> 23:15.792
How we gettin' there?

23:15.794 --> 23:17.627
- I haven't gotten that far yet.

23:18.998 --> 23:20.530
- So just so we're clear,

23:21.633 --> 23:23.166
these are like,
like ghosts, ghosts?

23:23.168 --> 23:25.268
Like, like, like Ghostbusters?

23:25.270 --> 23:26.903
- Ah, sure Trev.

23:26.905 --> 23:28.939
Just like Ghostbusters.

24:03.909 --> 24:05.308
- Drive.

24:05.310 --> 24:06.243
- We're not staying here?

24:06.245 --> 24:08.045
- No, I can't take the chance

24:08.047 --> 24:10.114
of Anne knowing where you are.

24:10.115 --> 24:12.182
I'm taking you to an outpatient
facility the institute has.

24:12.184 --> 24:14.618
It's rustic but it's safe.

24:36.208 --> 24:38.275
- Yes, this is the exact place

24:38.277 --> 24:40.343
I'd choose to hide from a ghost.

24:40.345 --> 24:42.345
- This is not like Ghostbusters.

24:44.283 --> 24:45.615
- You can't even
get signal out here.

24:45.617 --> 24:46.817
- I said it was rustic.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.351
Landline's inside.

24:48.353 --> 24:50.654
- You can't Instagram
from a landline.

24:50.656 --> 24:51.922
- Look, she's right.

24:51.924 --> 24:53.356
We're safer where
Anne can't find us.

24:53.358 --> 24:54.357
Give me a second, okay?

24:54.359 --> 24:55.725
I should go talk to her.

24:55.727 --> 24:57.294
- Go see if there's a bathtub.

24:58.964 --> 25:00.630
I'm serious, Jordan.

25:00.632 --> 25:02.966
If I can't take a bath, I'm
shutting this whole thing down.

25:06.071 --> 25:09.139
- Listen, this is a
safe psychic place.

25:09.141 --> 25:12.042
I bring institute patients
here all the time for healing.

25:12.044 --> 25:13.710
So you'll be safe here.

25:15.681 --> 25:19.015
Ah, there's a modest kitchen
but it does the trick,

25:19.017 --> 25:21.685
and living room, fireplace.

25:27.059 --> 25:29.059
Um, bedrooms this way.

25:30.395 --> 25:32.662
- Well, it
is a cabin, right?

25:32.664 --> 25:36.199
So maybe, it's kind of romantic.

25:36.201 --> 25:39.302
- Oh, Trevor.

25:47.279 --> 25:48.211
- We'll find him.

25:50.082 --> 25:51.748
He's still alive, I know it.

25:54.353 --> 25:55.719
- You can see him?

25:59.658 --> 26:03.360
But if he is, I'm worried
it's for one reason,

26:03.362 --> 26:04.261
bait.

26:08.967 --> 26:10.834
- Do the cops have any lead?

26:10.836 --> 26:12.836
- Jack has a violent past.

26:14.173 --> 26:15.939
The authorities think
he's a slam dunk suspect,

26:15.941 --> 26:18.275
but they can't see
the real threat.

26:19.077 --> 26:21.912
I mean, Anne needs Jack for now.

26:21.914 --> 26:25.982
But the longer she's back,
the stronger she'll become.

26:29.721 --> 26:32.956
People
here think I'm crazy,

26:32.958 --> 26:34.457
but they have to see.

26:35.727 --> 26:38.361
I'm hoping that you can
convince the sheriff.

26:39.831 --> 26:41.731
- Unless he thinks
I'm crazy too.

26:51.743 --> 26:52.709
- What is it?

26:54.713 --> 26:55.779
- The twins.

26:59.151 --> 27:00.717
They're out there.

27:01.753 --> 27:02.485
They're hurt.

27:03.789 --> 27:04.888
- Anne hurt them.

27:07.459 --> 27:12.729
Jordan, I want you to know
what we're up against.

27:13.732 --> 27:15.999
What Anne did to the twins,

27:16.001 --> 27:18.168
she did to my guard,

27:18.170 --> 27:19.502
and she wants to do to you.

27:19.504 --> 27:23.039
That's the whole reason
that she took Larry.

27:26.245 --> 27:29.279
We can beat her together.

27:29.281 --> 27:31.248
- Not just Anne,

27:31.250 --> 27:36.186
I have to worry about, the
people in your institute.

27:36.989 --> 27:38.255
started out like me

27:40.425 --> 27:41.925
and look where they ended up.

28:12.257 --> 28:13.156
- Hello?

28:22.034 --> 28:22.866
Hello?

28:25.804 --> 28:28.038
- Wakey, wakey, little mouse.

28:34.212 --> 28:39.082
Little mouse don't
like being trapped.

28:39.084 --> 28:40.850
Makes two of us.

28:40.852 --> 28:44.254
Me and a little mouse.

28:44.256 --> 28:45.822
Peas in a pod.

28:45.824 --> 28:47.157
- Stop.

28:47.159 --> 28:49.592
- You wanna know a little
secret she told me?

28:51.596 --> 28:53.029
- She?

28:53.899 --> 28:55.231
Anne?

28:55.233 --> 28:58.868
- She told me that if I
did a good job for her,

28:59.871 --> 29:02.038
I get to be bad to you.

29:02.040 --> 29:03.573
- You don't have to do this.

29:03.575 --> 29:05.942
You don't have to
let her control you.

29:10.015 --> 29:11.014
- Control me?

29:15.020 --> 29:15.919
Control me?

29:17.289 --> 29:19.956
Little mouse.

29:19.958 --> 29:21.991
You're not here with Anne.

29:35.107 --> 29:37.040
You're here with me.

30:00.132 --> 30:02.065
- We're here to
see Sheriff Hall.

30:03.935 --> 30:04.768
I know you haven't met him yet,

30:04.770 --> 30:08.505
but Sheriff's a
little hard nosed.

30:08.507 --> 30:10.073
- He can't be any worse
than the last guy.

30:10.075 --> 30:12.675
- Oh, believe me, I
can be plenty worse.

30:12.677 --> 30:15.445
- Sheriff, this
is the young woman

30:15.447 --> 30:17.013
that I wanted you to speak with.

30:17.015 --> 30:18.248
This is Jordan.

30:18.250 --> 30:19.349
- Joseph Hall.

30:19.351 --> 30:20.950
- Any news on Larry?

30:20.952 --> 30:23.019
- Oh, you don't
miss a beat, do ya?

30:23.021 --> 30:24.654
We're looking.

30:24.655 --> 30:26.288
This Jack, for an
escaped mental patient,

30:26.291 --> 30:28.291
he's proving to be very
difficult to track down.

30:28.293 --> 30:30.226
- That's because
it's not just him.

30:32.497 --> 30:35.231
- Hey, get me a cup of coffee.

30:39.471 --> 30:42.605
I know this is a very
difficult time for both of you,

30:42.607 --> 30:46.142
but if you're here to sell me
on the ghost story nonsense,

30:46.144 --> 30:49.045
you're wasting your time.
- Did you see that young man?

30:49.047 --> 30:51.981
Have you ever seen a
murder like that before?

30:51.983 --> 30:53.082
- Let me help.

30:53.084 --> 30:55.418
Maybe your officers
are missing clues.

30:55.420 --> 30:57.587
I can see the signs
that point to Anne.

30:59.424 --> 31:01.458
If we get to Anne,
we get to Larry.

31:03.161 --> 31:05.028
- Carson's not as
polite as I am,

31:06.164 --> 31:08.064
but my patience
only goes so far.

31:16.341 --> 31:19.142
Give me your number
and your address.

31:19.144 --> 31:21.711
We'll get in contact with
you when we have a lead.

31:21.713 --> 31:23.046
A real lead.

31:48.473 --> 31:50.273
Brett, I'm calling
it for the night.

31:50.275 --> 31:51.407
- Roger that, cupcake.

31:51.409 --> 31:52.675
- Idiot.

31:52.677 --> 31:54.244
- Hey, Hall?
- Yeah?

31:54.246 --> 31:56.079
- Watch out for the
ghosts out there.

31:56.081 --> 31:59.082
- Hey man, that's what
people see what they want to.

31:59.084 --> 32:00.283
You know what I mean?

32:00.285 --> 32:01.217
- Yeah.
- Don't kill yourself

32:01.219 --> 32:02.752
on the paperwork, though.

33:28.740 --> 33:30.256
- Hey, hey!

33:30.257 --> 33:31.773
Hey, get me out of here!

33:31.776 --> 33:33.409
Get me out of here!

33:34.879 --> 33:36.679
- Where is she?

33:36.681 --> 33:38.381
- Last chance you weirdo.

33:38.383 --> 33:39.749
Get me out of here!

33:44.422 --> 33:45.321
- Okay.

33:46.191 --> 33:47.757
- Where you going?

33:47.759 --> 33:48.658
Hey!

33:49.794 --> 33:50.693
Hey!

34:17.589 --> 34:18.788
- Isn't this enough?

34:18.790 --> 34:20.757
Don't you see what
we're talking about now?

34:21.926 --> 34:25.628
- I see that you were right
not to disclose your location.

34:25.630 --> 34:27.897
- We're not here for an
explanation or an apology.

34:27.899 --> 34:29.232
We need your help.

34:29.234 --> 34:30.466
- An apology?

34:30.467 --> 34:31.934
My friend is dead.

34:31.936 --> 34:34.270
If you don't think that I'm
doing everything that I can,

34:34.272 --> 34:35.505
you guys are crazy.

34:35.507 --> 34:37.273
- We're really sorry
about your deputy.

34:37.275 --> 34:38.541
- Let me see the
security footage.

34:38.543 --> 34:39.542
If I can I.D. her for you--

34:39.543 --> 34:42.277
- Listen, the drives were fried.

34:42.280 --> 34:44.313
There was a power
surge last night.

34:45.417 --> 34:48.518
I saw your deposition
in the Sanders case.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.753
If those twins can find
you, why can't your aunt?

34:50.755 --> 34:52.221
- Because I was
wearing the ring.

34:52.223 --> 34:53.856
It links me to the twins.

34:53.858 --> 34:55.190
Let them track me.

34:55.927 --> 34:57.560
Ask her.
- Right.

34:57.562 --> 35:00.263
- Sheriff, please.

35:00.265 --> 35:02.899
Larry's out there, I know it.

35:02.901 --> 35:04.200
She's keeping him.

35:04.202 --> 35:06.302
- If I had one shred of evidence

35:06.304 --> 35:07.270
for your little ghost story,

35:07.272 --> 35:08.738
I'd go back to the institute

35:08.740 --> 35:11.474
and I would start the search
all over, all by myself.

35:11.476 --> 35:12.942
But I'm not doing that.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.744
You wanna know why?

35:14.746 --> 35:16.212
Because this is crazy.

35:27.258 --> 35:32.328
- You like
that one?

35:34.332 --> 35:35.531
- Is he gonna help?

35:35.533 --> 35:38.267
- Idiot, look at their faces.

35:38.269 --> 35:40.770
- So, is that a no?

35:40.772 --> 35:42.739
Not without evidence.

35:44.342 --> 35:47.977
He said if he had some, he'd
start back at the institute.

35:47.979 --> 35:50.313
- Well they're not gonna find
a reason to go back there.

35:50.315 --> 35:51.848
- But we might.

35:51.850 --> 35:53.716
Do you still have
the security feed?

35:54.753 --> 35:56.018
- I have it on my phone.

35:58.022 --> 35:58.855
Hang on.

36:03.762 --> 36:04.627
Well?

36:06.030 --> 36:06.929
- She's there.

36:22.013 --> 36:24.814
- What a find.

36:24.816 --> 36:26.549
What a find, indeed.

36:28.553 --> 36:31.487
Would you like to know
what it's like to be me?

36:41.065 --> 36:42.899
Oh, little mouse.

36:43.735 --> 36:45.401
She's here.

36:56.080 --> 36:57.780
- Come on, give me
the key, I'm going in.

36:57.782 --> 36:59.315
- Are you mad?
- Jordan, no.

36:59.317 --> 37:00.900
- I'm the only that can see her.

37:00.901 --> 37:02.484
You, you guys are
just sitting ducks.

37:05.924 --> 37:06.823
Five minutes.

37:10.995 --> 37:12.862
- Okay, be careful.

37:12.864 --> 37:15.565
- If I'm not out, come in.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.400
- Oh, this is a load of bull.

37:17.402 --> 37:18.367
Three minutes!

38:22.000 --> 38:24.967
- Okay, now let her
know you're here.

38:32.477 --> 38:33.509
- Larry?

39:24.896 --> 39:28.064
Larry?

39:28.066 --> 39:29.632
Larry, oh my, god.

39:30.601 --> 39:33.002
- Jordan.
- Larry, are you okay?

39:34.472 --> 39:35.805
- They wanted you to come.

39:35.807 --> 39:36.973
They know you're here.

39:38.443 --> 39:39.175
- I know.

39:51.489 --> 39:55.925
I got you.

39:55.927 --> 39:58.561
We gotta get up here.

39:58.563 --> 39:59.962
Hurry.

39:59.964 --> 40:01.230
I'm sorry, come on.

40:01.232 --> 40:02.131
Come on.

40:03.534 --> 40:04.266
Hold on.

40:05.603 --> 40:06.836
Ah, come on,

40:06.838 --> 40:08.704
come on, come on, come on.

40:08.706 --> 40:09.638
I'm so sorry, come on.

40:09.640 --> 40:11.674
We gotta get out of here.

40:26.524 --> 40:28.024
- Hello, Jordan.

40:28.026 --> 40:30.926
I got someone here that's
been waiting to see you.

40:40.904 --> 40:42.170
You wanna join in?

40:59.624 --> 41:03.893
- You have no idea how hard
I have fought for this.

41:14.639 --> 41:17.907
- Jordan, Jordan,
you live, Jordan!

41:18.743 --> 41:19.608
Jordan!

41:20.311 --> 41:21.577
Jordan!

41:28.286 --> 41:31.353
- Come on, we need,
we need to get out of here.

41:40.298 --> 41:42.765
- Larry, Larry!

41:44.669 --> 41:46.035
Oh, my god, Larry.

41:47.171 --> 41:48.904
- It's alright, drive!

41:50.942 --> 41:52.641
Oh, my god.

41:52.643 --> 41:53.943
Will you drive?

41:53.945 --> 41:55.144
- I'm taking us to the cabin.

41:55.146 --> 41:57.613
- We're not going to any cabin.

41:57.615 --> 41:58.948
We've got Larry,
that's it, done.

41:58.950 --> 42:00.716
We're leaving Silver Falls now.

42:00.718 --> 42:01.650
- He's going into shock.

42:01.652 --> 42:02.351
He needs to warm up.

42:02.353 --> 42:04.003
It's safe there.

42:04.004 --> 42:05.654
We raise his temperature
and then we're gone.

42:10.995 --> 42:12.161
Start a fire.

42:12.163 --> 42:13.729
Get him as warm as possible.

42:13.731 --> 42:15.631
I'll call the police.

42:15.633 --> 42:18.367
- I have no idea.
- Let me.

42:22.673 --> 42:23.806
- How are you feeling?

42:24.809 --> 42:27.276
- This is place you decide
to hide from a ghost?

42:27.278 --> 42:28.410
- That's what I said.

42:29.714 --> 42:31.313
- What
did she do to you?

42:31.315 --> 42:35.151
- I, I can feel myself going.

42:35.153 --> 42:38.220
Not dead, just trapped.

42:39.957 --> 42:41.290
I'm okay now.

42:41.292 --> 42:43.926
Thank you for coming back.

42:49.767 --> 42:51.000
- Sheriff's on his way.

42:52.170 --> 42:53.035
How is he?

42:53.037 --> 42:54.270
- Mom, I'm fine.

42:55.740 --> 42:57.006
- I need to talk to you.

42:58.876 --> 43:00.743
Your patients, how
does it happen?

43:00.745 --> 43:01.944
How do they go crazy?

43:01.946 --> 43:03.913
- My patients aren't crazy.

43:10.288 --> 43:12.421
We're not made to
see what they see.

43:13.691 --> 43:17.426
Contact with occult
takes a toll.

43:18.763 --> 43:21.830
Each time a bit more until--

43:23.768 --> 43:24.733
- Until there's nothing left.

43:31.008 --> 43:32.041
- You felt it?

43:32.043 --> 43:33.175
- I could barely think straight.

43:33.177 --> 43:34.310
- At the institute?

43:38.849 --> 43:43.018
Jordan, sweetheart,
you have to avoid it.

43:44.088 --> 43:46.188
At any cost.

43:46.190 --> 43:49.491
- But this never
happened with the rings.

43:49.493 --> 43:52.761
- Right, that's because you
weren't doing the heavy lifting.

43:54.832 --> 43:57.399
When the twins
died in the rings,

43:57.401 --> 44:00.436
it endowed the rings with power.

44:01.839 --> 44:05.407
So wearing those rings allowed
you to enter the twins world,

44:06.744 --> 44:09.878
and when the twins wore
them, they entered ours.

44:10.514 --> 44:14.516
That's different than your mind

44:14.518 --> 44:16.452
allowing you to
cross that barrier.

44:17.788 --> 44:18.520
Okay?

44:24.095 --> 44:24.827
Okay.

44:28.132 --> 44:29.798
It's been a long couple of days.

44:31.836 --> 44:33.836
- I just want it all to end.

44:33.838 --> 44:34.870
Now it never will.

44:36.274 --> 44:38.173
Larry and I are just gonna
keep seeing ghosts until--

44:38.175 --> 44:40.075
- Larry can't see ghosts.

44:42.813 --> 44:44.046
- He saw Anne at the institute.

44:46.150 --> 44:47.249
Saw her coming right for him.

44:47.251 --> 44:49.551
- No, that's impossible.

44:49.553 --> 44:51.854
I've tested Larry,
he can't see ghosts.

44:57.561 --> 44:58.827
- Larry?

44:58.829 --> 45:00.229
Your hands.

45:00.231 --> 45:01.530
- What?

45:05.903 --> 45:07.836
- No.

45:07.838 --> 45:10.806
- She died in that ring
just like the twins.

45:10.808 --> 45:13.976
She wanted us to take you
so she could track us.

45:13.978 --> 45:15.077
- Then get rid of it.

45:16.580 --> 45:18.180
- Trevor, Trev, Trevor?

45:18.182 --> 45:19.381
Stop it.
- No!

45:19.383 --> 45:20.816
- Jesus Christ.
- Ow, Trevor, stop.

45:20.818 --> 45:22.318
- This is ridiculous.

45:22.319 --> 45:23.819
- No matter what you do,
it's not gonna budge.

45:23.821 --> 45:24.920
- You can't take it off?

45:24.922 --> 45:26.889
- Not until the person it
belongs to wants it off.

45:31.896 --> 45:34.363
- Oh, my god, we have
to get out of here.

45:34.365 --> 45:36.031
Right now, right now!

45:36.033 --> 45:37.232
- I'll get
him, I'll get him.

45:37.234 --> 45:38.367
- Go, go, go, go!

45:38.369 --> 45:41.970
Go, go!

46:24.882 --> 46:26.882
- What the hell do we do now?

46:26.884 --> 46:28.951
Where do we go?
- There's nowhere we can go.

46:28.953 --> 46:30.219
This thing is big neon sign

46:30.221 --> 46:31.954
says, this way to
soft, tasty kids.

46:31.956 --> 46:32.988
- We get out of town now.

46:32.990 --> 46:34.356
- She'll just follow us.

46:34.358 --> 46:35.591
- She'll follow you.

46:35.593 --> 46:36.925
- Alright, you guys
have done enough.

46:36.927 --> 46:38.627
- Uh-huh.
- You can stay,

46:38.629 --> 46:40.028
you don't have to come.

46:40.030 --> 46:42.398
- You guys aren't going
anywhere without me.

46:42.400 --> 46:43.665
- So what do we do now?

46:43.667 --> 46:45.234
- Jordan's right.

46:45.236 --> 46:47.436
Get out of Silver Falls.

46:47.438 --> 46:48.337
All of you.

46:50.674 --> 46:51.407
- And you?

46:51.408 --> 46:52.141
- Drop me at the house.
- No.

46:52.143 --> 46:54.643
- She's not after me.
- I don't care.

46:54.645 --> 46:56.445
This time you're coming with me.

46:56.447 --> 46:58.914
- Honey, getting out of
town only buys you time.

46:58.916 --> 47:00.649
We have to stop her.

47:00.651 --> 47:03.919
- At the institute, my hand
went right through her.

47:03.921 --> 47:05.454
How do you stop someone
you can't even touch?

47:10.428 --> 47:12.661
- I have boxes of patient files

47:12.663 --> 47:14.196
on the ghosts in those woods.

47:15.299 --> 47:18.967
It's our best shot of
me finding her weakness.

47:21.372 --> 47:26.375
- Mom, just be careful.

47:26.944 --> 47:27.643
Okay?

47:38.622 --> 47:40.189
- You guys get
out of here as fast as you can.

47:40.191 --> 47:41.990
Just go, okay? I'll be fine.

47:43.561 --> 47:44.393
Go.

48:56.300 --> 48:57.766
- Trev?
- Yeah?

48:57.768 --> 48:58.767
- Pull over.

48:58.769 --> 49:00.135
- Why?

49:00.137 --> 49:01.403
- It's been long enough.

49:03.774 --> 49:05.140
Everyone needs sleep.

49:06.143 --> 49:07.209
Okay?

49:08.178 --> 49:09.344
- Okay, fuck.

49:22.626 --> 49:23.559
We're here.

49:25.696 --> 49:27.462
- As in for pee break?

49:30.834 --> 49:32.534
- It's fine.

49:32.536 --> 49:34.503
- Yeah, for a pee break.

49:37.107 --> 49:38.173
Oh.

49:45.849 --> 49:47.382
- So I got two rooms.

49:49.086 --> 49:52.287
- Jordan, you and Zoe take one.

49:52.289 --> 49:54.423
- Oh, you guys are ridiculous.

49:54.425 --> 49:55.390
Come on, Trevor.

49:57.628 --> 49:59.127
- I guess you guys
are on your own.

50:22.786 --> 50:25.120
So, sharing a room, huh?

50:25.122 --> 50:26.188
- Dream big, Trev.

50:30.628 --> 50:32.227
- What?

50:32.229 --> 50:33.128
- Oh, thank god.

50:35.332 --> 50:37.232
Alone time.

50:37.234 --> 50:38.133
20 minutes.

50:39.603 --> 50:41.203
Actually, 30.

50:54.518 --> 50:57.252
- Who the hell even takes baths?

51:10.200 --> 51:11.700
- Oh, piece of crap.

53:13.690 --> 53:15.824
- I may not be
delivering on the ghost,

53:15.826 --> 53:19.461
but a chick in the tub's
gotta be worth a few likes.

53:37.314 --> 53:39.314
Guys, sorry I haven't been able

53:39.316 --> 53:41.049
to show you any real ghosts.

53:41.051 --> 53:43.451
- Oh, great.
- But I figured.

53:51.795 --> 53:54.329
- Back to not talking
about what's wrong with us?

54:00.437 --> 54:01.369
- It's me.

54:04.408 --> 54:05.507
I'm sorry.

54:07.911 --> 54:09.477
My mom and

54:12.115 --> 54:15.417
my family's not exactly a
picture of mental health.

54:18.388 --> 54:21.389
If any of
them's a part of me,

54:21.391 --> 54:25.594
it's, it's only
a matter of time.

54:28.098 --> 54:31.766
- Jordan, you're not your mom.

54:31.768 --> 54:32.834
You're not Anne.

54:36.673 --> 54:37.572
You're special.

54:41.845 --> 54:42.777
Just be you.

54:43.647 --> 54:45.113
- Saying someone's special

54:45.115 --> 54:48.083
is just another way of
saying you're on your own.

54:57.461 --> 54:58.426
- You're not.

55:16.580 --> 55:17.479
- What?

55:19.483 --> 55:20.649
Sure, come in.

55:24.521 --> 55:26.021
- Oh, cute.

55:30.560 --> 55:31.960
I like that one.

55:37.534 --> 55:39.467
- You guys must think
I'm pretty dumb, huh?

55:39.469 --> 55:42.170
- Um, no.

55:42.172 --> 55:44.606
Is this gonna take long?
- It's okay, I am.

55:44.608 --> 55:47.442
You know, thinking coming
out here would impress her.

55:47.444 --> 55:49.544
- Trev, Zoe just needs time.

55:49.546 --> 55:52.647
She's shy.

55:52.649 --> 55:54.749
Can we talk about this later?

55:54.751 --> 55:55.917
- Shy?

55:55.919 --> 55:57.485
Does this look shy to you?

55:58.188 --> 55:59.454
- I've figured.
- Holy shit.

56:02.159 --> 56:03.058
- Zoe!
- Zoe!

56:05.195 --> 56:06.094
- Start the car.

56:14.471 --> 56:16.004
- Alright, guys.

56:16.005 --> 56:17.538
Since you enjoyed the
first one so much,

56:17.541 --> 56:19.741
here is take two on bath time.

56:20.844 --> 56:23.244
Rule number one, when
running from a ghost

56:23.246 --> 56:24.245
always make sure.

56:29.019 --> 56:31.519
- What's
taking so long?

56:31.521 --> 56:33.088
No, Trevor!
- Stop yelling at me.

56:41.732 --> 56:42.564
- Zoe!

56:53.076 --> 56:55.710
Oh, my god, no, no, no, no, no!

56:59.716 --> 57:00.982
- Jordan.

57:04.821 --> 57:05.720
- Zoe?

57:06.289 --> 57:07.756
- Where's Jordan?

57:18.835 --> 57:21.269
- Show her all.

57:21.271 --> 57:23.238
- No, Jordan!

57:23.240 --> 57:25.540
- No, no!

57:31.281 --> 57:32.680
- No, no, no!

57:52.636 --> 57:56.971
- Alright, there's
gotta be something here.

57:56.973 --> 57:57.839
Come on.

58:13.657 --> 58:14.722
Of course.

58:17.627 --> 58:18.827
- Where's my phone?

58:18.829 --> 58:20.028
Guys, where's my phone?

58:22.332 --> 58:25.633
Holy shit.

58:25.635 --> 58:26.768
Holy shit.

58:26.770 --> 58:28.603
I just got attacked by a ghost.

58:30.107 --> 58:31.172
I just got attacked by a ghost,

58:31.174 --> 58:33.374
and I caught it all on video.

58:33.376 --> 58:35.710
Jordan, look.

58:37.948 --> 58:38.847
Jordan?

58:43.120 --> 58:44.752
- Guys, where was Jack?

58:47.190 --> 58:48.623
- I don't know.

58:59.836 --> 59:00.768
- Larry.

59:00.770 --> 59:02.770
- Mom, Mom, we saw Anne and,

59:02.772 --> 59:04.973
and we didn't see Jack.
- Whoa, whoa.

59:04.975 --> 59:05.874
Honey--
- We--

59:05.876 --> 59:06.975
- Slow down, what?

59:08.745 --> 59:11.079
- Anne attacked us and we
did not see Jack there.

59:13.683 --> 59:16.684
Mom?

59:16.686 --> 59:19.754
- Larry, Larry, I
think I figured out.

59:19.756 --> 59:21.890
I think I, I know
how to stop her.

59:23.894 --> 59:25.293
No, Mom.

59:25.295 --> 59:26.227
Mom?

59:26.229 --> 59:27.128
Mom?

59:28.365 --> 59:29.697
- What happened?

59:32.169 --> 59:33.067
The number you have called

59:33.069 --> 59:34.302
has been disconnected.

59:49.085 --> 59:49.918
- This is Hall.

59:49.920 --> 59:51.819
- Sheriff, um.

59:53.223 --> 59:53.955
- Jack.

59:55.325 --> 59:56.724
- What?
- Ah, no, no, no.

59:56.726 --> 59:58.026
Stop, please.

59:58.028 --> 59:59.394
Please, Jack, I can help you.

59:59.396 --> 01:00:02.063
- You mean commit me?
- Jack, please.

01:00:02.065 --> 01:00:04.265
- You know what I
like about killing?

01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:05.833
It makes the voices stop.

01:00:06.803 --> 01:00:07.936
Something you could never do.

01:00:16.213 --> 01:00:17.278
The number you've called

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.113
has been disconnected.
- Come on.

01:00:29.326 --> 01:00:30.725
- Freeze!

01:00:30.727 --> 01:00:33.228
Freeze, sheriff's department.

01:00:39.336 --> 01:00:41.469
Dr. Parrish?

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:43.905
Dr. Parrish, are you okay?

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:48.376
Dr. Parrish?

01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:55.250
- Okay, thanks.

01:00:58.788 --> 01:01:00.188
They're letting
me in to see her.

01:01:01.324 --> 01:01:03.925
She's out of surgery
but not waking up.

01:01:07.264 --> 01:01:08.129
- How's Larry?

01:01:13.036 --> 01:01:17.872
- Jordan, what about you?

01:01:21.544 --> 01:01:24.078
- You guys gotta get
out of Silver Falls.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:25.847
She's only after
you to get to me.

01:01:29.052 --> 01:01:29.951
Thank you.

01:01:31.421 --> 01:01:32.320
For everything.

01:01:51.408 --> 01:01:54.842
- If she can just tell
us what she found,

01:01:54.844 --> 01:01:56.744
we could stop all of this.

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:02.817
- Maybe she doesn't
have to tell us.

01:02:04.821 --> 01:02:05.586
The files.

01:02:15.532 --> 01:02:17.231
What did she, what
did she find here?

01:02:17.233 --> 01:02:19.200
There's nothing in
the patient files.

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:29.544
- You guys didn't really
think we'd leave you alone.

01:02:29.546 --> 01:02:31.446
- Have you guys found anything?

01:02:31.448 --> 01:02:33.698
- I don't know what to do.

01:02:33.699 --> 01:02:35.949
I mean, every time she
wants to touch us, she can,

01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:37.485
but when we go to fight back,

01:02:37.487 --> 01:02:38.953
we go right through her.

01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:40.922
- I can fight her.

01:02:41.624 --> 01:02:43.391
I hit her in the motel.

01:02:43.392 --> 01:02:45.159
- No, taking her on
alone is a death wish.

01:02:49.132 --> 01:02:50.031
- That's it.

01:02:52.369 --> 01:02:54.268
Um.

01:02:55.972 --> 01:02:56.938
The twins.

01:02:58.208 --> 01:02:59.974
We don't have to
fight them alone.

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.900
- You guys, this is a bad idea.

01:03:25.902 --> 01:03:28.436
The twins are not the
same as you remember.

01:03:28.438 --> 01:03:29.604
She's changed them.

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:33.007
- Then we need to
change 'em back.

01:03:35.912 --> 01:03:36.944
- Be careful.

01:03:58.201 --> 01:04:01.502
- There's
no place to hide.

01:04:01.504 --> 01:04:02.336
She's coming here.

01:04:04.574 --> 01:04:06.441
- Jordan?
- I can't.

01:04:06.443 --> 01:04:08.443
- It's our only chance.

01:04:09.946 --> 01:04:12.213
- They're too close.

01:04:12.215 --> 01:04:13.281
- You can do this.

01:04:13.283 --> 01:04:14.949
- You don't get it!

01:04:14.951 --> 01:04:17.018
Every time I see them
it eats away at me.

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:19.654
- Jordan.
- They tear you apart.

01:04:19.656 --> 01:04:21.022
- Jordan?

01:04:21.024 --> 01:04:22.957
Face it, we have to do this.

01:04:22.959 --> 01:04:25.092
If we're gonna survive,
it's now or never.

01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:36.737
- Jordan.

01:04:55.558 --> 01:05:00.094
- No, stop, stop!

01:05:00.096 --> 01:05:02.430
I know you know who I am.

01:05:02.432 --> 01:05:04.765
Now, I need you

01:05:04.767 --> 01:05:06.701
to remember who you are.

01:05:06.703 --> 01:05:08.369
Holly, Heather Dahl.

01:05:08.371 --> 01:05:12.039
You came back from the dead

01:05:12.041 --> 01:05:15.176
to get revenge on the
people who killed you.

01:05:23.586 --> 01:05:25.386
Anne took so much from you.

01:05:27.357 --> 01:05:29.156
Don't let her take who you are.

01:05:30.727 --> 01:05:33.160
Remember what makes you you.

01:05:57.820 --> 01:06:00.354
Now will help us stop Anne?

01:06:11.267 --> 01:06:12.433
- Is this gonna work?

01:06:13.403 --> 01:06:14.602
- We'll see.

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:19.707
- God, this place
gives me the creeps.

01:06:19.709 --> 01:06:21.108
Let's get out of here.

01:06:24.847 --> 01:06:26.147
- You sure?

01:06:27.517 --> 01:06:28.816
This cabin is kind of romantic.

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:30.418
- Let's go, Trev.

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:32.753
- Even after the motel
after I rescued you?

01:06:32.755 --> 01:06:35.089
- Oh, shut up, Trev.

01:07:30.279 --> 01:07:33.147
- Maybe
this isn't such a good idea.

01:07:35.251 --> 01:07:36.517
- No, not with that leg.

01:07:38.254 --> 01:07:40.154
Wait here, call the sheriff.

01:07:41.858 --> 01:07:42.823
This is my battle.

01:07:45.328 --> 01:07:47.261
- No, you can't
go in there alone.

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:50.798
- Alone?

01:07:52.235 --> 01:07:53.701
This is three versus one.

01:07:58.941 --> 01:07:59.774
- Jordan?

01:11:19.842 --> 01:11:20.708
- Jordan.

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:29.683
Look at me.

01:11:29.685 --> 01:11:33.420
Look at me while I take
everything from you.

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:08.489
- I figured a video
of me in the bath will help.

01:12:31.647 --> 01:12:33.047
- Anne?

01:12:48.831 --> 01:12:52.499
- Good, now I can
finish you all at once.

01:12:54.537 --> 01:12:55.269
- Jordan?

01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:00.207
Look.

01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:59.099
- Larry, the switch!

01:13:59.101 --> 01:14:00.234
- Let her go!

01:14:58.961 --> 01:15:00.227
- That's close enough.

01:15:02.598 --> 01:15:03.363
- Oh, Jack!

01:15:04.667 --> 01:15:05.766
- Listen to me.

01:15:06.702 --> 01:15:07.634
It's over.

01:15:07.636 --> 01:15:08.769
Anne's gone.

01:15:11.006 --> 01:15:12.072
Anne's gone.

01:15:14.376 --> 01:15:15.209
- Good.

01:15:16.178 --> 01:15:17.311
- No!

01:15:17.313 --> 01:15:21.181
- Zoe!

01:15:25.654 --> 01:15:26.887
- Never miss twice.

01:15:32.128 --> 01:15:34.661
- Are you guys okay?
- Yeah.

01:15:58.687 --> 01:16:00.387
- Are you okay?

01:16:00.389 --> 01:16:03.123
- I, I just
wanna see my mom.

01:16:03.125 --> 01:16:05.692
- Hey, Larry, hospital
called earlier

01:16:05.694 --> 01:16:06.393
at the station house.

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:08.195
It's good news.

01:16:08.197 --> 01:16:09.730
She's gonna pull through.

01:16:10.699 --> 01:16:12.065
Yeah.

01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:14.902
My deputy will take
you down there.

01:16:14.904 --> 01:16:16.436
Go see your mom.

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:19.740
Hey, Jordan?

01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:24.678
I gotta ask, how'd you know
Jack was gonna be here?

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:27.881
- Ghosts.

01:16:30.219 --> 01:16:32.152
- Get out of my
crime scene, you two.

01:16:50.773 --> 01:16:53.173
Alright, alright,
alright, alright.

01:16:53.175 --> 01:16:54.441
I've had enough of that.

01:17:10.726 --> 01:17:11.825
Ghosts, my ass.
