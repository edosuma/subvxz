10:58.225 --> 11:00.260
THAT IS NOT TRUE!

11:00.260 --> 11:02.996
[ Loud voice ] I HATE IT
HOW THESE RUMORS

11:02.996 --> 11:04.898
JUST COME OUT OF NOWHERE!

11:04.898 --> 11:07.100
[ Normal voice ]
AND THESE PEOPLE WOULD SPOOK

11:07.100 --> 11:09.970
LIKE A HERD OF CATTLE
IF THEY HEARD THAT.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.139
NOT THAT THEY'RE CATTLE --
THEY'RE PEOPLE,

11:12.139 --> 11:14.507
BUT 20 OF THEM ARE GONNA
GET MADE INTO HAMBURGER.

11:14.507 --> 11:15.843
NO.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.845
VANESSA AND I HAVE GONE
THROUGH THESE FILES,

11:17.845 --> 11:20.981
AND THESE 20 PEOPLE
ARE INDISPENSABLE.

11:20.981 --> 11:24.351
WE BOTH FEEL WE HAVE TO FIND
SOMEWHERE ELSE TO MAKE THE CUTS.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.418
I DISAGREE.

11:25.418 --> 11:28.655
I THINK THAT THESE 20 PEOPLE
HAVE GOT TO GO

11:28.655 --> 11:30.758
IF WE'RE GONNA BALANCE
THIS BUDGET.

11:30.758 --> 11:32.760
WHAT?!

11:32.760 --> 11:35.328
JACK, I TRIED EXPLAINING THIS
TO GEORGE,

11:35.328 --> 11:37.464
BUT HE'S TOO CLOSE
TO THESE PEOPLE.

11:37.464 --> 11:40.734
GEORGE, LOOK, I GOT AEROCORP
BREATHING DOWN MY NECK

11:40.734 --> 11:42.169
TO MAKE CUTS.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.104
SOMETIMES I THINK YOU FORGET
YOU'RE MANAGEMENT.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.973
YOU'RE STILL THINKING
LIKE YOU'RE ON THE LINE.

11:45.973 --> 11:49.843
DON'T LISTEN TO HER!
SHE'S A COMPLETE LIAR, JACK!

11:51.411 --> 11:53.280
JACK, I --

11:53.280 --> 11:56.416
I HEARD SHE TOLD A RACIST JOKE
BY THE WATER COOLER.

12:01.121 --> 12:03.623
IS IT THE ONE ABOUT THE BLIND
RABBI AT THE SUSHI BAR?

12:03.623 --> 12:05.225
'CAUSE THAT'S MINE!

12:05.225 --> 12:06.493
[ BOTH LAUGH ]

12:10.630 --> 12:13.233
NO, SHE CAN'T DO THAT TO ME.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.268
YOU DON'T COME DOWN
TO MY FACTORY

12:15.268 --> 12:16.904
AND MAKE ME LOOK LIKE A FOOL.

12:16.904 --> 12:19.106
I CAN'T BELIEVE
VANESSA BETRAYED YOU,

12:19.106 --> 12:22.142
AND AFTER SHE HAD DINNER
AT OUR HOUSE WITH OUR FAMILY.

12:22.142 --> 12:25.412
OH, MY GOD --
I TOLD HER MY "I DO" SLOGAN.

12:25.412 --> 12:28.415
WHAT IF SHE STEALS IT?

12:28.415 --> 12:30.750
THEN ALL IS LOST.

12:32.352 --> 12:35.255
THANKS TO YOU,
I'M GONNA BE OUT OF WORK.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.791
NO MONEY,
NO HEALTH INSURANCE.

12:37.791 --> 12:39.692
THERE GO MY DREAMS
OF RETIREMENT.

12:39.692 --> 12:43.230
I WAS GONNA SPEND MY LAST FEW
YEARS AT A VEGAS CRAPS TABLE

12:43.230 --> 12:46.466
WITH A SMOKE IN ONE HAND
AND AN OXYGEN TANK IN THE OTHER.

12:48.836 --> 12:50.838
LOOK, I'LL FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT, MOM, OKAY?

12:50.838 --> 12:54.141
'CAUSE YOU DON'T
UNDERESTIMATE GEORGE LOPEZ.

12:54.141 --> 12:56.676
THEY DID WHEN THEY SAID
I'D NEVER READ,

12:56.676 --> 12:58.946
AND 12 YEARS LATER I DID.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.647
THEY SAID I'D NEVER
MAKE MANAGER,

13:00.647 --> 13:03.951
AND 15 YEARS LATER I DID.

13:03.951 --> 13:07.720
SO, SOMEWHERE
BETWEEN 12 AND 15 YEARS

13:07.720 --> 13:09.923
VANESSA'S IN A WORLD
OF TROUBLE!

13:12.592 --> 13:14.261
BABE, YOU READY FOR DINNER?

13:16.596 --> 13:19.099
RANDY...

13:19.099 --> 13:22.469
I'M READY FOR A WHOLE LOT MORE
THAN DINNER.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.570
[ LAUGHS ]

13:23.570 --> 13:25.205
NO, NO.

13:25.205 --> 13:28.275
I'M TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING
DEEPER THAN THAT.

13:28.275 --> 13:32.712
RANDALL McGEE,
I WANT TO MOVE IN WITH YOU.

13:32.712 --> 13:36.816
REALLY?
BABY, THAT'S GREAT!

13:36.816 --> 13:38.485
WHAT MADE YOU
CHANGE YOUR MIND?

13:38.485 --> 13:41.421
WELL, I-I REALIZED THAT YOU'RE
MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TO ME

13:41.421 --> 13:42.655
THAN THAT JOB.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.457
JUST SCREW THAT THING.

13:44.457 --> 13:47.560
I WANT TO SHARE YOUR LIFE,
YOUR HOME,

13:47.560 --> 13:50.030
YOUR MEDICAL AND DENTAL.

13:50.030 --> 13:53.400
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M GETTING
A LITTLE HOMEMAKER.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.736
SO, BABE, DOES THIS MEAN
THERE'S GONNA BE A HOT MEAL

13:56.736 --> 13:58.838
READY FOR ME
WHEN I GET OFF WORK?

14:00.207 --> 14:03.243
ARE YOU GONNA PICK IT UP
ON YOUR WAY HOME?

14:03.243 --> 14:07.747
THEY SAID I'D NEVER
LEARN FRACTIONS,

14:07.747 --> 14:10.183
AND NINE YEARS LATER I DID!

14:10.183 --> 14:13.220
THEY SAID I'D NEVER
PAY OFF THE HOUSE,

14:13.220 --> 14:16.023
AND 32 YEARS FROM NOW
I WILL!

14:17.857 --> 14:19.592
32 YEARS?

14:19.592 --> 14:23.430
I REFINANCED, AND THEY TRICKED
ME WITH FRACTIONS.

14:23.430 --> 14:26.499
COME ON, ANGIE, PLEASE!
MY JOB'S ON THE LINE!

14:26.499 --> 14:29.802
HONEY, LET'S THINK
THIS THING THROUGH.

14:29.802 --> 14:32.239
THIS WOMAN IS SMART,
SHE HAS DEGREES,

14:32.239 --> 14:35.875
SHE HAS BUSINESS SAVVY,
SHE HAS UNSHAKABLE CONFIDENCE.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.577
YOU HAVE NONE OF THAT.

IF MY HEAD FITS IN THE OVEN.

14:43.616 --> 14:48.155
WHAT YOU DO HAVE IS E.I. --

14:48.155 --> 14:51.024

15:03.603 --> 15:05.805

YOU'RE A GOOD JUDGE
OF CHARACTER.

INTELLIGENCE.

GONNA HELP ME WITH HER?

15:21.154 --> 15:23.256
TOMORROW SHE'S GONNA SEND OUT
THOSE PINK SLIPS.

15:23.256 --> 15:26.126

WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO
THOSE PEOPLE'S LIVES.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.860

WHO'S GETTING PINK SLIPS?

15:27.860 --> 15:29.562

YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY,

HAVE EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE.

DON'T JUST MAKE UP CRAP!
I GOT BILLS!

16:08.335 --> 16:11.471

WHAT HAPPENED?

16:11.471 --> 16:14.641
BAGFUL OF KITTIES KEEP FLOATING
TO THE TOP OF THE LAKE?

16:17.510 --> 16:20.180
THERE WAS BROKEN GLASS
ALL OVER MY PARKING SPACE,

16:20.180 --> 16:22.582
AND "LYING HO"
WAS PAINTED OVER MY NAME.

TO DO WITH THAT.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.820

IT WAS YOUR MOM.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.989

WHILE SHE FINISHED PAINTING.

16:33.060 --> 16:35.195

FROM A FIGHT,

16:35.195 --> 16:38.331

THOSE PEOPLE THEN LET'S DO IT.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.435

ON THE LIST.

MIKE, YOU WANT
TO COME IN HERE?

TO SAY TO YOU.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.994
OF GOING HOME AND EXPLAINING IT
TO HIS FAMILY, ALL RIGHT?

17:08.994 --> 17:10.163

TO COME IN HERE?

17:14.534 --> 17:16.035

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:16.035 --> 17:18.238
VANESSA, THIS IS MIKE'S MOM,

17:18.238 --> 17:23.576

JUSTIN, MIKE, JR., AND SARAH.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.345
I'M THIS MANY.

17:26.713 --> 17:30.083
SO, VANESSA,
TELL MIKE AND HIS FAMILY

17:30.083 --> 17:33.220
ABOUT YOUR IDEA
TO CUT COSTS.

17:33.220 --> 17:36.356

THIS MANY.

TO MEET YOU ALL.

OKAY, SO A GUY WITH THREE KIDS
WHO'S TAKING CARE OF HIS MOM.

17:53.340 --> 17:54.674

OF GUYS AND BRING YOUR MOM IN.

AM I GONNA HAVE TO MEET?

THE FAMILIES DOING HERE?

18:42.355 --> 18:44.657
GEORGE PULLED THIS STUNT
TO STOP THE FIRINGS.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.859
I WANTED TO SHOW HER
ALL THE FAMILIES

18:46.859 --> 18:48.395

18:50.330 --> 18:53.300

18:55.668 --> 18:58.037
SO, IS IT DONE?

18:58.037 --> 18:59.172
WE DON'T HAVE TO.

WE CAN KEEP THE 20 JOBS

IN THIS FACTORY

19:02.342 --> 19:04.944
AGREES TO WORK LONGER HOURS
AND TAKE A PAY CUT.

19:04.944 --> 19:07.714
YOU ARE NEVER GONNA GET
THE EMPLOYEES TO AGREE TO THAT.

THE EMPLOYEES TO AGREE TO THAT,

THAT'S 12 TO 15 YEARS
AHEAD OF SCHEDULE.

19:22.229 --> 19:24.197

PULL THAT OFF?

19:24.197 --> 19:25.632

TWO MANAGERS AROUND HERE.

OFF THE FLOOR

20:23.089 --> 20:25.258

PEOPLE SKILLS, NOT LIKE ME.

20:25.258 --> 20:27.494
"HELLO, HOW ARE YOU?"

NO, THEY PROMOTED HER.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.667
SOMETHING ABOUT HER BEING
GOOD WITH NUMBERS

MY PAYCHECK, ANGIE,

SHE'S PAYING THE WINNER!

TO TAKE A LITTLE PAY CUT,

20:46.946 --> 20:49.449
BUT IT'S COOL, THOUGH, BECAUSE
I'LL BE WORKING MORE HOURS.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.418

FROM ME!

TO GET FIRED, GEORGE.

ABOUT THAT JOB ANYMORE.
