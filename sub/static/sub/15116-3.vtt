WEBVTT

00:00.803 --> 00:01.756
You there Tokyo?

00:01.781 --> 00:03.161
<i>Yeah, Tokyo here.</i>

00:03.415 --> 00:04.528
Cairo, you hear me?

00:04.553 --> 00:05.674
Cairo rules!

00:05.699 --> 00:07.383
Alright Los Angeles
is in the house.

00:07.408 --> 00:08.608
Alright, let's do it.

00:08.896 --> 00:10.032
Hey Newt, maybe this time
you don't want to

00:10.057 --> 00:11.639
put the grenade launcher
under the garage.

00:12.207 --> 00:14.308
Says the soldier who
kills his own people, right.

00:14.343 --> 00:16.309
Lie down next to
the doorway, all right, hot shots?

00:16.344 --> 00:18.479
-Come on. Let's do this.
-Let's do it, L.A.

00:18.514 --> 00:20.914
Come on.

00:20.948 --> 00:22.601
-Ohh!
-No! No, no, no, no, no!

00:22.635 --> 00:24.195
-What happened?
-We're down.

00:24.229 --> 00:26.035
What happened?
What are you doing?

00:26.070 --> 00:27.338
I got kicked offline.

00:27.372 --> 00:28.710
What were you doing?

00:28.744 --> 00:30.522
Were you messing
with our Internet again?

00:30.556 --> 00:32.426
I was just I.M.'Ing
with a friend...

00:32.460 --> 00:34.537
And updating my profile
and writing an e-vite.

00:34.572 --> 00:36.113
For the party in your pants?

00:36.147 --> 00:37.681
How dare you?
I'm gonna call Gene.

00:37.715 --> 00:39.548
Clan member #1:
No. Don't call Gene, all right?

00:39.583 --> 00:41.250
Just call the -- the --
the heroes of tech.

00:41.285 --> 00:42.385
All right? They're good.

00:42.419 --> 00:43.686
Those guys are plumbers.

00:43.720 --> 00:45.321
Our system doesn't talk
to the tower.

00:45.355 --> 00:47.456
Even <i>i</i> can't fix it.

00:47.490 --> 00:49.291
Only Gene Toy can keep us
on the grid.

00:49.325 --> 00:50.693
Guys, I think
I'm gonna take off.

00:50.727 --> 00:52.393
-No, come on, hold on.
-What?

00:52.428 --> 00:54.028
Oh, come on,
like you got somewhere to be?

00:54.063 --> 00:56.096
Yeah, I'm gonna head out, too.

00:56.130 --> 00:57.564
Come on, come on. Just stick
around. We'll play beer Jenga.

00:57.598 --> 00:59.799
Yeah, come on, you guys.
Come on. Don't.

00:59.834 --> 01:01.635
Eh.

01:01.669 --> 01:04.404
If you leave, we'll be
alone with each...

01:07.342 --> 01:09.646
Maybe it'll come back on.

01:30.289 --> 01:31.901
I optimized bandwidth
last week.

01:31.902 --> 01:33.603
I don't understand.

01:33.638 --> 01:35.507
Streaming porn, music,
and live-action gaming,

01:35.541 --> 01:37.275
you need the bandwidth
of a Vegas hotel.

01:37.310 --> 01:38.843
-It's the gaming.
-It's not the gaming.

01:38.878 --> 01:40.512
It's definitely the gaming.

01:40.547 --> 01:42.215
Gene Toy!
How you been, man?

01:42.249 --> 01:44.417
I've been doing some stuff
out in Joshua Tree.

01:44.451 --> 01:45.818
I went on a vision quest

01:45.852 --> 01:47.453
and had sex
for 12 straight hours

01:47.487 --> 01:49.488
on a mountaintop
in Joshua Tree once.

01:49.522 --> 01:52.891
I would've kept going, but, uh,
we were surrounded by coyotes.

01:52.925 --> 01:54.559
Is any of that true?

01:54.593 --> 01:55.927
I went to Joshua Tree once.

01:55.962 --> 01:57.495
Everything cool now,
I hope?

01:57.529 --> 01:58.896
No. I'm moving to Chicago.

01:58.931 --> 02:00.832
-What?
-Whoa.

02:00.866 --> 02:02.333
You cannot move to Chicago.

02:02.367 --> 02:03.734
What about building
your own business?

02:03.768 --> 02:04.969
You can't abandon your dream.

02:05.004 --> 02:06.638
Or us.

02:06.673 --> 02:08.372
I'm sorry.
It's out of my hands.

02:08.407 --> 02:10.342
This guy accused me of
stealing meat from his market.

02:10.377 --> 02:12.245
I didn't, but that doesn't
matter in Chinatown.

02:12.279 --> 02:16.618
I know all about C-Town.
It's all Triad and Black Rain.

02:16.652 --> 02:18.720
-Black Rain was in Japan.
-Yeah.

02:18.754 --> 02:21.256
See, when you're accused
in Chinatown, you're shunned.

02:21.290 --> 02:23.391
There's no future for me
here anymore.

02:23.426 --> 02:25.828
-That sucks.
-I'm sorry.

02:25.862 --> 02:27.630
I, uh, I can't reprogram
your grid.

02:27.664 --> 02:29.899
Uh, it takes too many man-hours
that I don't have.

02:29.933 --> 02:32.968
And I got to pack.
I-I'm sorry.

02:33.003 --> 02:34.803
-Oh, all right.
-We understand, man.

02:34.838 --> 02:36.872
-Just...
-Wow. Sorry!

02:36.906 --> 02:39.841
Sorry you can't do what we...

02:39.876 --> 02:42.377
I want to play games.

02:43.942 --> 02:47.713
Morning, everyone.
Two new cases today.

02:48.418 --> 02:52.422
A former assistant at <i>Stirred</i>
<i>is coming in,</i>

02:52.456 --> 02:53.924
claiming that she was fired

02:53.958 --> 02:56.727
for being -- get this --
too attractive.

02:56.762 --> 02:58.329
<i>Stirred?</i> What's...

02:58.364 --> 02:59.931
It's a luxury
and lifestyle magazine.

02:59.966 --> 03:02.033
It's for men, so you guys
probably haven't heard of it.

03:02.068 --> 03:05.471
Really? You want to go there,
Mr. Mani and Pedis on Saturdays?

03:05.505 --> 03:06.939
Um, and, second,

03:06.974 --> 03:08.875
the wife of one
of our biggest clients

03:08.909 --> 03:11.712
has been cited
for public urination

03:11.746 --> 03:13.581
outside of a Red Lobster.

03:13.615 --> 03:15.283
Oh, well, there you go.

03:15.317 --> 03:16.751
That's got "Franklin and Bash"
written all over it.

03:16.785 --> 03:17.986
No, we'll take
the <i>Stirred</i> case.

03:18.020 --> 03:19.621
-Ah.
-Okay, sure.

03:19.656 --> 03:21.356
I mean, I've seen the plaintiff.
It's a solid case.

03:21.391 --> 03:23.658
But I don't know
that you two newbies...

03:23.693 --> 03:25.661
-Did he call us noobs?
-Yeah.

03:25.695 --> 03:28.364
...That you two newbies
have the bag

03:28.399 --> 03:30.366
to go up against the magazine's
founder, Big Mack.

03:30.401 --> 03:32.536
Uh, actually, uh,
it's his daughter, Katherine,

03:32.570 --> 03:34.338
that's running it now.

03:34.372 --> 03:37.842
Very sexy. I'd like to see <i>her</i>
<i>in the Swimsuit issue.</i>

03:37.876 --> 03:39.911
We'll take the case.
And we'll win it.

03:39.945 --> 03:42.881
-Ah! Good.
-There is no way.

03:44.116 --> 03:45.784
I guarantee it.

03:45.818 --> 03:46.918
You want
to put some money on it?

03:46.952 --> 03:49.721
-Ooh!
-Yeah.

03:49.755 --> 03:51.489
I've seen you eyeballing
our ginormous office.

03:51.523 --> 03:53.024
It's almost too big for us.

03:53.058 --> 03:54.926
-It's just the two of us.
-It's just -- I know.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.394
Well, my contract stipulates

03:56.428 --> 03:58.062
that I get
the second-largest office,

03:58.096 --> 04:00.364
so, technically,
that office is already mine.

04:00.399 --> 04:02.633
And yet I bring in
twice the business you do.

04:02.667 --> 04:04.969
All right,
our double-wide office

04:05.003 --> 04:06.637
for that sweet guitar in yours.

04:06.672 --> 04:08.506
Well,
not the Gretsch White Falcon

04:08.540 --> 04:09.707
that I got you from Jack White?

04:09.741 --> 04:11.610
No, no, no, you're crazy.
Don't.

04:11.644 --> 04:14.746
You want to give up
the present from your uncle?

04:14.781 --> 04:17.882
I'm sorry,
what were you saying about bag?

04:17.918 --> 04:19.886
Deal.

04:19.920 --> 04:21.720
All right.

04:21.755 --> 04:24.823
Did you get that?
All right.

04:24.858 --> 04:26.925
We need to find somebody
to replace Gene Toy.

04:26.960 --> 04:29.461
We shouldn't have had Pindar
cobble together that lame grid.

04:29.495 --> 04:31.763
Oh, man, we could lose our right
to host "Killzone" marathons.

04:31.797 --> 04:33.097
It's like losing the Olympics.

04:33.131 --> 04:35.532
I say we go to Chinatown,
have lunch,

04:35.566 --> 04:37.400
and check out the scene
of the crime,

04:37.435 --> 04:38.902
see if we can help Gene out.

04:38.936 --> 04:43.406
Excuse me. Um,
I'm here to meet my attorneys.

04:43.440 --> 04:45.608
Red Lobster!

04:45.643 --> 04:48.411
Oh.
Allure by Chanel.

04:48.446 --> 04:50.447
I'm Jennifer Putnam
from <i>Stirred.</i>

04:50.481 --> 04:54.051
<i>You're</i> claiming
<i>Stirred</i> magazine fired you

04:54.085 --> 04:56.420
because you were too hot?

04:56.455 --> 04:59.390
Wow.
That's not my word exactly.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.526
But, well, thank you. Yes.

05:06.933 --> 05:08.199
Would you excuse us?

05:10.036 --> 05:12.637
-Karp! What are you doing?
-No, no, no.

05:12.672 --> 05:13.972
Hey. Yo.
Hey. We need to talk.

05:14.006 --> 05:15.773
Hey, hey, stop walking!

05:15.808 --> 05:17.641
You knew she wasn't pretty.

05:17.676 --> 05:19.977
Depending on the time of
night. She's last-call pretty.

05:20.011 --> 05:22.112
-Yeah. In Alaska.
-The bet is off.

05:22.146 --> 05:24.681
You made a verbal
commitment in front of witnesses

05:24.715 --> 05:26.816
to win the case, so suck it.

05:26.851 --> 05:30.187
Uh -- you have awoken
the bear, my friend!

05:31.923 --> 05:34.190
Ladies.

05:34.225 --> 05:35.925
-Hi.
-Hey.

05:35.960 --> 05:36.924
As assistant
to the publisher,

05:36.925 --> 05:38.659
what were your responsibilities?

05:38.681 --> 05:41.683
To answer Katherine's
phone, keep her schedule,

05:41.717 --> 05:45.654
and help plan events, like this
weekend's mega-fundraiser.

05:45.688 --> 05:47.089
Did she ever say to you

05:47.123 --> 05:49.025
you were "too beautiful"
to work there?

05:49.059 --> 05:51.961
No, she didn't have to.

05:51.995 --> 05:53.729
The amount of attention
I received

05:53.764 --> 05:55.799
from the men in the office
was overwhelming.

05:55.833 --> 05:58.201
I'm sure.

05:58.236 --> 06:00.003
But we're gonna need specifics.

06:00.038 --> 06:04.341
Oh, uh, well,
they swarmed around my desk,

06:04.375 --> 06:07.378
held doors for me,
followed me off the elevator.

06:07.412 --> 06:10.214
Is that specific enough?

06:12.851 --> 06:15.752
You're really staring at me.

06:16.755 --> 06:18.422
It's hard not to.

06:20.058 --> 06:23.127
-Have you ever modeled?
-And gotten paid for it?

06:23.161 --> 06:25.029
Oh, if you walk
through this world

06:25.063 --> 06:27.798
knowing that you're beautiful,
other people will know it, too.

06:27.832 --> 06:29.967
Okay, so, I'll --
I'll -- I'll write "no."

06:30.001 --> 06:32.069
If you want, sure.

06:32.103 --> 06:35.106
Uh, what do -- what do the
other women in the office look like?

06:35.140 --> 06:37.975
They're what I'd call
traditionally attractive.

06:38.010 --> 06:40.144
I'm sort of an exotic bird
at <i>Stirred.</i>

06:40.178 --> 06:42.813
Got it. Okay. Well, we'll
take a ride over to the office later

06:42.848 --> 06:45.049
and see if there's any shot
at a settlement.

06:45.083 --> 06:46.750
Oh, I don't want to settle.

06:46.785 --> 06:49.086
Sorry? Hmm?

06:49.120 --> 06:50.854
I want my day in court.

06:50.889 --> 06:54.358
This isn't just about my job.
This is big.

06:54.392 --> 06:57.428
I'm the Norma Rae
of beautiful women.

06:57.462 --> 06:59.329
Okay, well, that --
that'll -- that'll do it.

06:59.364 --> 07:01.265
-Yeah.
-Because we need to

07:01.299 --> 07:03.100
confer to see if we're actually
gonna decide to take your case.

07:03.134 --> 07:04.868
This is gonna be great.

07:04.902 --> 07:06.703
Who knows --
we could be in this

07:06.738 --> 07:08.405
all the way
to the Supreme Court!

07:08.440 --> 07:10.741
This --

07:10.775 --> 07:11.975
There's a chance.

07:12.009 --> 07:13.844
-Sure.
-There is.

07:15.392 --> 07:17.182
I can't tell if
Jennifer is delusional

07:17.206 --> 07:18.973
or has the most inflated
if self-esteem ever.

07:19.451 --> 07:21.852
I always thought
they were one and the same.

07:21.886 --> 07:24.755
"Your strength and endurance
are legendary with oral sex."

07:24.790 --> 07:26.090
I'm supposed to
do the punch lines.

07:26.124 --> 07:27.825
No, it actually says that.

07:27.859 --> 07:29.360
We should eat there more often.

07:29.394 --> 07:30.895
I know.

07:33.131 --> 07:34.798
-Excuse me.
-Sorry.

07:34.833 --> 07:37.434
Sorry. Thank you.

07:42.007 --> 07:44.708
Behind you!

07:44.743 --> 07:46.844
We're, uh -- oh, ho ho!
You all right?

07:46.878 --> 07:48.279
We're looking for Mr. Han.

07:48.313 --> 07:50.414
Dad! There's some guys
here to see you!

07:50.449 --> 07:53.251
-Hey.
-He stole a rabbit?

07:54.286 --> 07:55.854
May I help you?

07:55.888 --> 07:57.856
Uh, yeah,
we represent Gene Toy,

07:57.890 --> 07:59.925
and you're gonna have to
take that down,

07:59.959 --> 08:02.729
'cause he hasn't been charged
with anything and it's defamatory.

08:02.763 --> 08:04.931
It's my store.
I do things my way.

08:04.966 --> 08:07.735
Okay, sir, what exactly
are you accusing him of?

08:07.769 --> 08:10.839
Stuffing a frozen rabbit
down his pants.

08:10.873 --> 08:12.840
Aw, who hasn't
accidentally done that?

08:16.378 --> 08:19.413
I'm sure he had every intention
of paying for the rabbit.

08:19.447 --> 08:21.182
He had no receipt.

08:21.216 --> 08:24.051
Gene Toy steals from my store,
he steals from my family!

08:26.087 --> 08:27.921
You know what I'm thinking?

08:27.955 --> 08:30.723
Injunctive relief and force
Han to take down these signs?

08:30.758 --> 08:32.390
-Absolutely.
-Sorry.

08:32.426 --> 08:34.494
-But right now?
-Palate cleanser.

08:34.528 --> 08:36.296
-Yeah.
-Okay.

08:43.371 --> 08:44.806
Oh.

08:44.840 --> 08:46.308
Here you go, gentlemen.

08:46.342 --> 08:48.110
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

08:48.144 --> 08:49.878
We wouldn't get
any work done here.

08:49.913 --> 08:52.014
Unh-unh.

08:52.048 --> 08:53.949
Mmm. Mmm.

08:59.088 --> 09:00.923
Mm-hmm.

09:00.957 --> 09:04.927
Mr. Franklin, Mr. Bash.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.529
Her claim is unusual,

09:06.563 --> 09:08.931
especially considering
the other women who work here.

09:08.965 --> 09:11.400
So I'd like to make this quick
and easy for everyone.

09:11.434 --> 09:12.902
We're all ears.

09:12.936 --> 09:14.103
Jennifer drops the lawsuit,

09:14.137 --> 09:15.371
and, in turn, we provide her

09:15.405 --> 09:17.140
with a glowing
recommendation letter.

09:17.174 --> 09:18.908
No mention
that she was terminated.

09:18.942 --> 09:20.910
Wow.
So your settlement offer

09:20.944 --> 09:22.879
is a promise
not to be mean to her.

09:22.913 --> 09:25.881
Jennifer Putnam
wasn't good at her job.

09:25.915 --> 09:27.349
That's why she was fired.

09:27.384 --> 09:29.551
Our client disagrees
with you, Katherine.

09:29.586 --> 09:31.520
She's never been fired
from a job before,

09:31.555 --> 09:33.022
and she's got glowing reviews

09:33.056 --> 09:35.024
from her past supervisors
here at <i>Stirred.</i>

09:36.426 --> 09:38.828
I was her most recent
supervisor.

09:38.862 --> 09:41.797
These are performance memos
from August on.

09:41.832 --> 09:44.133
I know we can come
to a quick resolution.

09:44.168 --> 09:46.369
Hey!

09:46.403 --> 09:48.371
-How's it going over here?
-Dad, I got this.

09:48.405 --> 09:50.940
Can we meet Big Mack?
Can we just say "hi"?

09:50.974 --> 09:52.875
Just to shake the hand
of the man who --

09:52.909 --> 09:54.443
No, you're just gonna walk away
like that, right?

09:54.478 --> 09:55.545
It's nothing.
Don't worry about it.

09:55.579 --> 09:57.113
Big Mack. Big Mack!

09:57.147 --> 09:59.449
-Don't do that. Don't.
-No?

09:59.483 --> 10:01.250
The next time you're in the end
zone, act like you've been there before.

10:01.285 --> 10:03.052
Oh, I never have --
not in an end zone like this.

10:03.087 --> 10:06.055
Holy -- shhh.
Give me a minute.

10:10.528 --> 10:13.430
Uh, not many women
feel comfortable

10:13.464 --> 10:16.366
holding eye contact
for more than three seconds.

10:16.400 --> 10:21.105
A less worldly man
might consider that predatory.

10:21.139 --> 10:23.540
Your accent is wonderful!

10:23.574 --> 10:26.076
I bet I can tell
where you're from.

10:26.111 --> 10:27.945
Oh. Impossible, darling.

10:27.980 --> 10:30.915
Any hometown inflection
has been watered down

10:30.949 --> 10:34.452
by 30 hard years
in Santa Monica.

10:35.988 --> 10:38.890
I hear Dartmoor...

10:38.924 --> 10:41.326
and University of Liverpool.

10:41.360 --> 10:44.462
Oh. Do I know you?

10:46.165 --> 10:48.065
Ah.

10:49.101 --> 10:52.603
What a lovely young woman.

10:54.239 --> 10:56.474
None of these memos are true.

10:56.509 --> 11:00.212
Katherine had it in for me
because I turned down surgery.

11:01.581 --> 11:06.052
Oh, the <i>Stirred</i> benefits package
includes plastic surgery.

11:06.086 --> 11:08.489
Katherine says everyone
has room for improvement.

11:08.523 --> 11:10.391
And you don't agree with that?

11:10.425 --> 11:13.995
No.
I'm fortunate.

11:14.029 --> 11:16.898
This package has gotten me
very far in life.

11:16.932 --> 11:20.168
I just remembered we're
supposed to call another client.

11:20.203 --> 11:23.171
Jennifer, could you give us
a-a moment, please?

11:23.205 --> 11:25.974
Oh, I get it --
lawyer-client privilege.

11:26.009 --> 11:28.276
That is so cool!

11:29.946 --> 11:32.915
Thank you.

11:32.949 --> 11:34.149
We got to get out of this.

11:34.184 --> 11:35.650
How?

11:35.685 --> 11:37.453
It's just always hard
to dump a girl.

11:37.487 --> 11:39.321
But the quicker you do it,
the less painful for everyone.

11:39.355 --> 11:40.556
The quicker <i>I</i> do it?

11:40.590 --> 11:42.524
You need more practice
than me.

11:42.559 --> 11:44.660
No! Infeld will be pissed,
Karp will get our office,

11:44.694 --> 11:46.462
and you and I will be relegated
to defending women

11:46.496 --> 11:48.264
who pee outside Red Lobster!

11:50.434 --> 11:52.201
-Come in.
-Is this a joke?

11:52.236 --> 11:55.171
Infeld's going around
calling her "captivating."

11:55.205 --> 11:56.638
She wasn't fired
for being too beautiful.

11:56.673 --> 11:59.207
She was fired
for not being pretty enough.

11:59.242 --> 12:02.543
She was discriminated against
but not for the reasons she thinks.

12:02.577 --> 12:04.311
That's a case we can win.

12:04.346 --> 12:06.312
Well, good luck telling
little Miss Sunshine.

12:06.347 --> 12:07.714
Oh, good lord.
Grow a pair.

12:07.748 --> 12:10.249
Hit her with the facts
and rip off the scab.

12:12.319 --> 12:14.520
I have a pair.

12:14.555 --> 12:18.191
Great -- we get to tell
a woman who feels beautiful

12:18.226 --> 12:20.994
that the rest of the world
doesn't even notice her --

12:21.028 --> 12:23.364
peeing outside of a Red Lobster,
nowhere near a school zone.

12:23.398 --> 12:24.665
-We fight this!
-Right.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.601
Hi, I'm Jenn.

12:26.636 --> 12:29.104
You know what -- I was gonna
get that same dress,

12:29.138 --> 12:31.340
but the fabric
was a little itchy.

12:31.374 --> 12:32.742
We would have been twins.

12:34.478 --> 12:36.145
I hope someone's
complimented you today,

12:36.179 --> 12:38.447
because you look
so absolutely fabulous.

12:38.482 --> 12:40.616
Thank you.

12:40.650 --> 12:42.618
Uh, Hanna.

12:42.652 --> 12:44.453
Nice meeting you.

12:44.487 --> 12:48.991
Jennifer.
We know that a jury...

12:49.025 --> 12:52.295
Well, I should say,
we've tried a lot of cases,

12:52.329 --> 12:56.266
and we...think...

12:56.300 --> 13:02.072
As we move forward...
You should -- we should, um...

13:02.107 --> 13:03.774
Peter?

13:03.808 --> 13:05.609
Guys.

13:05.644 --> 13:08.579
-Heads in the game, okay?
-Okay.

13:08.614 --> 13:11.249
We're gonna take your case

13:11.283 --> 13:13.518
because we agree
that you were fired...

13:15.053 --> 13:18.455
For being too beautiful,
and we're gonna prove it.

13:18.490 --> 13:21.224
We're gonna win.

13:21.258 --> 13:22.558
"We're gonna win" on 3.

13:22.593 --> 13:24.027
Okay. Come on.

13:24.061 --> 13:25.695
"We're gonna win." 1, 2, 3.

13:25.729 --> 13:28.565
-1, 2, 3...
-We're gonna win.

13:28.599 --> 13:30.266
We're gonna win!

13:30.300 --> 13:32.034
-Yeah. Oh, certainly.
-Yeah. I know.

13:32.069 --> 13:33.803
<i>Stirred</i> sees it

13:33.837 --> 13:36.072
as a straightforward
termination case.

13:36.106 --> 13:38.240
Well, Jennifer disputes
the performance memos.

13:38.275 --> 13:40.610
And she has a history
at this job and others

13:40.644 --> 13:42.645
of being competent
and responsible.

13:42.679 --> 13:44.681
Her face
isn't even symmetrical, people.

13:44.715 --> 13:46.682
Beauty is based on symmetry.

13:46.716 --> 13:49.152
My face?
Perfectly symmetrical.

13:49.186 --> 13:51.521
Had it professionally analyzed.

13:51.556 --> 13:53.423
Okay, you can't talk
for the rest of the day.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.292
What am I supposed to
do? We're still offline.

13:55.326 --> 13:57.060
I don't know.
That's all you've got?

13:57.095 --> 13:58.662
Insulting our client
or -- or firing up porn?

13:58.696 --> 14:00.531
Not a big reader.

14:00.566 --> 14:02.467
<i>Stirred</i> sells
the cool bachelor's life.

14:02.501 --> 14:04.135
What if we sell back?

14:04.170 --> 14:06.205
Ooh, like
"The emperor has no clothes."

14:06.239 --> 14:09.074
Yeah.
We make them define beauty.

14:09.109 --> 14:10.409
Gene Toy.

14:10.444 --> 14:11.811
-Gene Toy!
-Gene!

14:11.845 --> 14:13.512
You feeling
injunctively relieved?

14:13.547 --> 14:15.581
No.
Get your asses down here.

14:15.616 --> 14:17.850
I want to show you something.
Now!

14:19.419 --> 14:21.120
He just yelled at me.

14:25.825 --> 14:27.459
Whoa!

14:27.493 --> 14:29.861
What is this?

14:29.896 --> 14:31.830
Am I really that short?

14:31.864 --> 14:33.465
Just the angle.

14:33.499 --> 14:35.333
What does it say
under our picture?

14:35.368 --> 14:37.236
"Unclean
rabbit-thief lawyers."

14:37.270 --> 14:39.271
I take issue
with "unclean."

14:39.305 --> 14:40.773
My landlord evicted me.

14:40.807 --> 14:44.110
My investment club
kicked me out. I'm ruined here.

14:44.144 --> 14:46.112
All right, Gene, Gene,
we can fix all this.

14:46.146 --> 14:48.381
No. Can't you see
you've done enough harm?

14:48.415 --> 14:49.882
Just leave me alone.

14:49.917 --> 14:51.351
Gene, you can sue.

14:51.385 --> 14:52.752
No western courts.

14:52.787 --> 14:55.188
Don't you get it?
This is why I'm in this mess.

14:55.223 --> 14:57.157
Well, then, how do you
get justice around here?

14:57.191 --> 14:59.659
My only hope of repairing
the Toy family name

14:59.694 --> 15:02.762
and staying in Chinatown is to
land a hearing with the council.

15:02.797 --> 15:04.364
They have all the power.

15:04.398 --> 15:05.765
There's a Chinatown Council?

15:05.800 --> 15:07.333
This just keeps getting better.

15:07.368 --> 15:08.768
We want
to make it up to you, Gene.

15:08.802 --> 15:11.604
Yeah, you can.
Stay away from Chinatown.

15:11.639 --> 15:13.173
Gene! Don't...

15:13.207 --> 15:15.141
Damn, man.

15:15.176 --> 15:17.243
Are you gonna fix our grid?

15:18.646 --> 15:22.281
Last night, I shared
an incredibly expensive meal

15:22.316 --> 15:23.683
with the mayor.

15:23.717 --> 15:25.585
The nest of the swift bird

15:25.619 --> 15:29.489
is built entirely
out of her hardened saliva.

15:29.523 --> 15:32.492
Any idea where bird's nest soup
originated from,

15:32.526 --> 15:34.394
400 years ago?

15:34.428 --> 15:35.862
That's well before my time.

15:35.896 --> 15:37.530
Yeah. I don't know.

15:37.565 --> 15:39.366
Hmm.

15:42.871 --> 15:44.404
-Uh...
-Okay.

15:44.439 --> 15:45.872
This, we can ex--

15:45.907 --> 15:47.707
Someone had dinner in Chinatown.

15:47.741 --> 15:50.176
Yeah. A grocery-store
owner accused our friend

15:50.211 --> 15:51.778
of shoplifting,
and we tried to help.

15:51.812 --> 15:53.313
Good job on that.

15:53.347 --> 15:55.448
Your insensitivity
to their customs

15:55.483 --> 15:59.186
has made the Infeld/Daniels name
unclean.

15:59.220 --> 16:00.621
Sorry about that.

16:00.655 --> 16:02.589
We got injunctive relief
for our friend

16:02.624 --> 16:04.858
so the owner would have to
take down a damaging display.

16:04.893 --> 16:06.593
Injunctive relief?
No wonder!

16:06.628 --> 16:09.229
Why not just smear pig feces
all over his face

16:09.264 --> 16:11.498
in the middle
of Chung King Road?

16:11.533 --> 16:14.535
That was plan "B."
We were gonna start with...

16:14.569 --> 16:17.204
Sir, we've dropped the case,
and -- and we're gonna get

16:17.238 --> 16:18.973
-every last flyer taken down.
-Every one.

16:19.007 --> 16:22.409
Well, good, but that's
not gonna exonerate your friend.

16:22.443 --> 16:26.546
No, he's trying to get some date
with the Chinatown Council.

16:26.580 --> 16:31.318
The apocryphal
council of elders!

16:31.352 --> 16:32.986
It <i>does</i> exist!

16:33.020 --> 16:34.621
I first heard about this

16:34.655 --> 16:38.624
during a game of pai gow
in Rangoon in '67.

16:38.658 --> 16:41.894
Now, your friend...

16:41.928 --> 16:44.696
<i>Must</i> get a hearing
with this council.

16:44.731 --> 16:46.999
Well, we promised him
we'd back off.

16:47.033 --> 16:48.800
Oh, very wise.

16:48.834 --> 16:51.869
You're obviously unschooled
in Chinese judicial culture.

16:51.904 --> 16:53.604
No, uh...

16:53.639 --> 16:55.839
Damien and I are
taking over the case.

16:55.874 --> 16:57.508
We're going to Chinatown.

16:57.542 --> 16:58.943
We?

16:58.977 --> 17:03.347
Well, y-you know
I don't parallel park.

17:10.565 --> 17:12.733
And we'll prove it,
because Jennifer Putnam

17:12.767 --> 17:15.268
is 50-car-pileup beautiful!

17:16.537 --> 17:18.738
Let me guess.

17:18.771 --> 17:22.107
Miss Sproik has a haughty sneer
on her face, huh?

17:23.843 --> 17:27.412
Like the only beautiful women
are in the pages of <i>Stirred.</i>

17:27.445 --> 17:29.314
But how can that be?

17:29.348 --> 17:31.750
You, ma'am. Your husband thinks
you're beautiful, right?

17:31.784 --> 17:34.553
And yet I don't recognize you
from any magazines,

17:34.587 --> 17:37.122
but that doesn't mean
you're not beautiful,

17:37.156 --> 17:39.291
because, believe me, you are.

17:39.325 --> 17:41.092
Ladies and gentlemen,

17:41.127 --> 17:43.227
we'll prove that Jennifer
was a great assistant.

17:43.262 --> 17:45.296
And it goes without saying --
but I'm gonna say it anyway --

17:45.330 --> 17:47.598
she is a stunner.

17:47.632 --> 17:50.467
Now, her looks may have been
disruptive <i>Stirred,</i>

17:50.501 --> 17:52.169
but it wasn't her fault.

17:52.203 --> 17:55.438
She didn't deserve to be fired
for how she looked.

17:55.473 --> 17:57.907
That is discrimination.

18:05.148 --> 18:08.317
This is more fun
than I thought.

18:11.588 --> 18:14.123
That's great.
I take it back.

18:14.158 --> 18:16.226
This was definitely
worth the trip.

18:16.260 --> 18:17.627
Mr. Han?

18:17.662 --> 18:19.563
Yes?

18:19.598 --> 18:21.632
Oh. Mr. Han. How do you
do? Damien Karp, Infeld/Daniels.

18:21.666 --> 18:23.568
This is Stanton Infeld, the
founding partner of the firm.

18:23.602 --> 18:25.136
How do you do?

18:25.170 --> 18:27.539
How many of you are there?

18:27.573 --> 18:30.174
The goat meat is tough
again. Can I send it back?

18:30.209 --> 18:31.909
Not now, Tonia.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.844
Uh, yes.

18:33.879 --> 18:36.380
You know, it's both
unusual and refreshing

18:36.414 --> 18:38.649
to see a female butcher.

18:38.683 --> 18:40.351
She's my daughter.

18:40.385 --> 18:41.685
Oh, I gathered.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.787
She rolled her eyes
when she went away.

18:43.822 --> 18:46.857
Sir, Gene Toy's original
attorneys are new to the firm.

18:46.891 --> 18:49.793
They're young. But they still
have more than 37 ad leases

18:49.827 --> 18:51.729
on bus benches
all across the city.

18:51.763 --> 18:54.331
There's no telling
what they might put on them.

18:54.366 --> 18:56.200
They could destroy
your business.

18:56.234 --> 18:57.735
You come here
to blackmail me?

18:57.769 --> 18:59.503
Uh, Mr. Han.

19:01.000 --> 19:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

19:16.355 --> 19:18.256
You got the meeting,
didn't you?

19:18.290 --> 19:20.592
Hmm? Ah.
Oh, look. Yeah.

19:20.626 --> 19:23.795
Sheep's brain on sale.

19:29.869 --> 19:31.703
Hmm.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.341
You get to sleep
with Zoe Saldana.

19:36.376 --> 19:37.542
I like it.

19:37.577 --> 19:38.844
But your mom has to watch.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.913
Um, I'll get it.

19:40.947 --> 19:44.516
How far away is mom?
And is she wearing her glasses?

19:44.551 --> 19:46.919
A foot away. And
up-to-date prescription specs.

19:46.953 --> 19:48.487
Can it be your mom?

19:48.522 --> 19:49.889
'Cause I think
I could get into that.

19:49.923 --> 19:51.590
-Hanna!
-Hanna?

19:51.624 --> 19:53.459
Welcome back
to the island of broken toys.

19:53.494 --> 19:55.494
Nice job
in court today, Peter.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.630
-I helped.
-I could, too.

19:57.664 --> 19:59.332
-How?
-Why?

19:59.367 --> 20:01.601
Well, because I'm
starting to like your client.

20:01.635 --> 20:03.569
And Karp thinks he's entitled
to your office,

20:03.603 --> 20:05.304
even though I've been
at the firm longer

20:05.338 --> 20:06.405
and my billables are higher.

20:06.440 --> 20:08.707
So, what's your strategy?

20:08.742 --> 20:11.443
Well, we're going for the
hard sell that our client's a babe

20:11.477 --> 20:12.845
and hoping
that'll force the defense

20:12.879 --> 20:14.947
to be mean to a sweet girl.

20:14.981 --> 20:16.782
Interesting.

20:16.817 --> 20:20.720
But beauty is about impact.

20:22.790 --> 20:24.457
Beauty...

20:24.492 --> 20:26.626
is the Helen of Troy...

20:26.661 --> 20:28.929
Launching a thousand ships
into battle.

20:30.365 --> 20:31.866
Beauty...

20:33.636 --> 20:38.507
...is <i>the</i> catalyst for making
creatures want to mate.

20:40.644 --> 20:42.378
Beauty...

20:42.413 --> 20:47.050
can make people
do irrational things.

20:50.087 --> 20:52.055
I'm gonna go masturbate.

20:54.558 --> 20:56.492
Just to be clear,

20:56.526 --> 20:59.561
that was the greatest legal
lecture we've ever heard.

20:59.595 --> 21:02.030
But, um
Now what?

21:02.065 --> 21:03.998
It's not enough
to tell jurors

21:04.033 --> 21:06.468
that your client is a babe.

21:06.502 --> 21:09.905
You have to show them
that beauty drives people

21:09.940 --> 21:11.974
to do irrational things.

21:12.009 --> 21:13.676
Show that Jennifer's beauty

21:13.711 --> 21:16.446
drove the men at <i>Stirred</i>
<i>to act inappropriately.</i>

21:16.481 --> 21:17.748
And convinced Katherine

21:17.782 --> 21:19.817
to remove Jennifer
from the equation.

21:19.852 --> 21:22.454
Love it. Love <i>this.</i>

21:23.956 --> 21:27.493
Miss Putnam, these are
photographs of female employees

21:27.527 --> 21:29.461
who worked with you
at <i>Stirred.</i>

21:29.496 --> 21:31.631
Do you think these women
are attractive?

21:31.665 --> 21:35.334
They put a lot of
effort into their appearance,

21:35.369 --> 21:36.669
which is admirable.

21:36.703 --> 21:38.604
It is.

21:38.638 --> 21:40.106
Do you think
you are more beautiful?

21:40.140 --> 21:43.076
Oh, that's not a fair question.

21:43.110 --> 21:46.346
Well, under normal
circumstances, I'd agree.

21:46.381 --> 21:48.682
But we are here today
because you claimed

21:48.717 --> 21:51.486
you were dismissed from your job
for being <i>too</i> beautiful.

21:51.520 --> 21:55.891
So that would imply that you are
more beautiful than these women.

21:55.925 --> 21:57.792
I don't say it to be conceited,

21:57.827 --> 22:00.028
but since I'm under oath,

22:00.063 --> 22:02.764
yes, I do think
I'm more beautiful than them.

22:02.799 --> 22:04.933
But not by much.

22:04.968 --> 22:06.668
Thank you, Miss Putnam.

22:06.703 --> 22:09.038
No more questions, your honor.

22:09.072 --> 22:10.540
Permission to redirect,
your honor.

22:10.574 --> 22:11.874
Really?

22:11.909 --> 22:15.644
The female jurors
identify with Jennifer.

22:15.679 --> 22:17.846
They want a shot
with guys like you.

22:17.881 --> 22:19.982
They want to be
your Helen of Troy.

22:20.016 --> 22:21.817
-You want the redirect?
-Not really.

22:21.851 --> 22:23.418
Why did Infeld hire you?

22:24.920 --> 22:27.088
React to Jennifer's beauty.

22:31.094 --> 22:33.096
Jennifer,
we're almost done here.

22:33.130 --> 22:35.531
You know,
you have been a great witness.

22:35.566 --> 22:37.067
Oh, you've been
a good lawyer, too.

22:37.101 --> 22:39.102
Thank you.
Yes, I-I'm your attorney.

22:39.137 --> 22:40.904
So you should be safe.

22:40.939 --> 22:43.641
I can't say the same when you're
under cross by Miss Sproik.

22:43.675 --> 22:45.877
She's just doing her job.

22:45.911 --> 22:48.813
Yes, she is -- just like
you were just doing yours

22:48.848 --> 22:50.515
<i>Stirred,</i> right?

22:50.549 --> 22:51.883
Yeah.

22:51.917 --> 22:54.919
Good. Good.

22:56.755 --> 22:59.424
So Jennifer...

22:59.458 --> 23:02.560
Can you tell the court

23:02.595 --> 23:05.930
how you would answer the phone
at <i>Stirred?</i>

23:05.964 --> 23:09.200
Uh, what I'd say
or how I'd say it?

23:09.235 --> 23:10.668
Either. Both.

23:10.703 --> 23:13.805
Here, pretend...
this is your phone.

23:13.839 --> 23:15.606
Oh, okay.

23:15.641 --> 23:17.208
Katherine Mack's office.
May I help you?

23:17.243 --> 23:20.211
Let me just make sure
my, uh, phone is turned off.

23:20.245 --> 23:22.180
That'd be embarrassing, huh?

23:22.214 --> 23:23.948
It would. It was off.

23:23.982 --> 23:26.250
But if someone had called,
would you have played along?

23:28.152 --> 23:29.786
You take a lot of pride
in the party

23:29.821 --> 23:31.688
that you planned
for the magazine, don't you?

23:31.723 --> 23:34.759
I do.
It's a fundraiser downtown.

23:34.793 --> 23:36.593
I got a lunch station

23:36.628 --> 23:39.129
where top chefs
like Wolfgang Puck make, uh --

23:39.164 --> 23:40.798
Let me guess. Lunch.

23:40.832 --> 23:42.533
Yes.

23:42.567 --> 23:44.235
Most important meal of the day.

23:44.269 --> 23:46.070
God, I'm...

23:46.104 --> 23:48.172
I'm so hungry.

23:51.577 --> 23:53.144
Are you hungry?

23:58.550 --> 24:00.117
You have to say "yes" or "no"

24:00.152 --> 24:02.854
so the court reporter
can <i>get it.</i>

24:04.289 --> 24:05.957
Okay.

24:05.991 --> 24:07.759
Unh-unh-unh.

24:07.793 --> 24:11.229
"Yes"...Or "no."

24:11.264 --> 24:14.232
Yes.

24:15.701 --> 24:17.669
Oh! Objection!

24:17.703 --> 24:21.506
Counsel is making out with his
client on the stand! Your honor!

24:21.540 --> 24:23.574
Mr. Bash, stop
kissing your client! Bailiff!

24:23.609 --> 24:25.944
Mr. Bash, I should have you
charged with contempt.

24:25.978 --> 24:27.979
It's okay. I don't
want to press any charges.

24:28.013 --> 24:29.546
Your honor, I'm so sorry.

24:29.581 --> 24:32.149
Mr. Bash was overcome
by Miss Putnam's beauty.

24:32.183 --> 24:33.850
It won't happen again.

24:54.464 --> 24:56.219
That was
a desperate attempt.

24:56.220 --> 24:57.236
Thanks.

24:57.237 --> 24:58.804
$25,000 to stop this.

24:58.839 --> 25:00.339
My father's a generous man.

25:00.374 --> 25:03.843
He's also worth
over $300 million.

25:03.877 --> 25:06.512
$55,000,
the recommendation letter,

25:06.547 --> 25:09.349
and a confidentiality clause
with penalty.

25:09.383 --> 25:11.784
-Fine.
-No way.

25:13.554 --> 25:15.354
You know where to contact me.

25:15.388 --> 25:17.590
Yes, I do.

25:17.625 --> 25:19.959
Hey, this is good money. And
we haven't proven anything yet.

25:19.993 --> 25:21.761
Where's Jenn?
Have you seen Jenn?

25:21.795 --> 25:23.362
Yeah, she's back at the office.

25:23.397 --> 25:24.897
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
You okay?

25:24.932 --> 25:28.969
The jury sees Jennifer
differently, and so do I.

25:29.003 --> 25:31.671
We're not settling.
Gather the troops.

25:34.642 --> 25:35.976
I have a strategy.

25:36.011 --> 25:38.712
Stock the courtroom
with unattractive women.

25:38.747 --> 25:40.247
It's through there.

25:40.282 --> 25:42.643
Give Jennifer
a comparative edge.

25:42.644 --> 25:44.404
How can somebody
so symmetrical be so

25:44.406 --> 25:45.516
annoying at the same time?

25:45.520 --> 25:47.255
I believe they're unrelated.

25:47.289 --> 25:48.756
Okay, when it was just us,

25:48.791 --> 25:50.926
$55,000 would have been
a gold rush.

25:50.960 --> 25:54.496
Okay, why would Katherine
offer a recommendation letter

25:54.531 --> 25:57.934
and then up the offer
to $55,000?

25:57.968 --> 26:00.303
Well, so far, we're stuck
at the "she said, they said."

26:00.338 --> 26:01.538
And there are a lot more
of them,

26:01.573 --> 26:02.940
and they're coming off
a little more --

26:02.975 --> 26:05.309
Sane? Yeah.

26:05.344 --> 26:07.345
I've been going over
these depo transcripts.

26:07.379 --> 26:09.347
Everybody is toeing
the company line.

26:09.381 --> 26:12.249
You would, too, if you had
Katherine Mack behind you. She's scary.

26:12.284 --> 26:14.018
Yeah.
It's like a culture of secrecy.

26:14.052 --> 26:16.654
You know what? If Jennifer was
as bad at her job as they say,

26:16.688 --> 26:18.389
why offer a settlement?

26:18.423 --> 26:20.690
Remember when we saw
Big Mack in the office?

26:20.725 --> 26:21.958
She did everything she could

26:21.992 --> 26:23.893
to make sure we had no contact
with him.

26:23.928 --> 26:26.696
Wait a second. She was
hiding Big Mack from you?

26:26.730 --> 26:28.464
Yeah, maybe.

26:28.499 --> 26:30.032
-Why?
-I don't know.

26:31.272 --> 26:32.570
There <i>is</i> that fundraiser

26:32.571 --> 26:34.215
that Jennifer was planning
with Katherine.

26:34.942 --> 26:36.430
Maybe Big Mack
will be there tomorrow.

26:36.781 --> 26:39.349
And so will we.

26:40.344 --> 26:42.545
Can you --
can you get down further?

26:42.580 --> 26:44.013
Uh, no, uh, I-I can't.

26:44.048 --> 26:46.316
Is your forehead
touching the floor?

26:46.350 --> 26:48.351
If you can't tell,
how will they?

26:48.385 --> 26:51.288
Oh. They know everything.

26:51.322 --> 26:52.856
You have to feel comfortable

26:52.890 --> 26:57.961
with the deeply respectful
kowtow that the council expects.

27:02.333 --> 27:03.933
Karp, I hope you got that raise.

27:03.967 --> 27:05.869
Oh, I'm --
I'm just fluffing. You're next.

27:05.903 --> 27:08.037
Mm-hmm.
Sir, we need you to sign off

27:08.072 --> 27:10.640
on an expense
for the <i>Stirred</i> case.

27:10.674 --> 27:12.074
It's for a table
at a public fundraiser

27:12.109 --> 27:13.743
that <i>Stirred</i> is co-sponsoring.

27:13.777 --> 27:15.544
It's a fantastic cause.

27:15.579 --> 27:17.813
And we want to ask Big Mack
some questions before trial.

27:17.847 --> 27:20.449
What is the fantastic cause?

27:20.483 --> 27:22.584
-Heal...
-Uh, save the rain f--

27:22.619 --> 27:24.920
-...Babies.
-Save the rain babies.

27:24.954 --> 27:28.089
Oh, all right. It's a
fundraiser. It's tax-deductible.

27:28.124 --> 27:29.858
Have a good time.

27:36.631 --> 27:38.965
See, this feels like home.

27:38.999 --> 27:41.867
Thank you.

27:44.705 --> 27:47.607
See, I like to think
that they're always here,

27:47.641 --> 27:50.777
throwing that ball back
and forth, back and forth.

27:50.811 --> 27:52.078
Ugh. Buzzkill.

27:52.113 --> 27:54.681
-Where?
-Katherine Mack.

27:54.715 --> 27:59.786
Peter, um, I don't
want this to be awkward,

27:59.820 --> 28:01.688
but you know what happened
in court yesterday,

28:01.722 --> 28:03.490
that wasn't real.

28:03.524 --> 28:05.157
You'll know when it's real.

28:07.993 --> 28:10.561
Jennifer Putnam
is suing us. She can't be here.

28:10.595 --> 28:13.996
Well, we wrote a check for
$5,000 for a public fundraiser.

28:14.031 --> 28:15.564
We're not here
to cause any trouble.

28:15.599 --> 28:18.567
Recycle, reuse...
And the other one.

28:18.601 --> 28:20.768
I don't care
about you. It's her I want out.

28:20.803 --> 28:23.137
She helped plan this shindig.

28:23.171 --> 28:25.139
She's not under house arrest.

28:25.173 --> 28:27.508
I don't want security
to have to throw her out.

28:27.543 --> 28:30.578
Oho! Do.

28:30.612 --> 28:33.047
Keep an eye on this group.

28:36.418 --> 28:39.153
-Whoo!
-Yeah.

28:40.956 --> 28:44.025
Aw, uh, come on!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:44.059 --> 28:46.660
Yeah. Yeah.

28:46.694 --> 28:48.628
You seeing what I'm seeing?

28:48.663 --> 28:50.963
Our client in a burkini?

28:50.998 --> 28:52.398
No.

28:52.432 --> 28:53.832
Hey, yeah. Big Mack.

28:53.866 --> 28:56.568
Doesn't look too uncomfortable
to be around her.

28:56.602 --> 28:58.770
Peter, there's someone
I want you to meet.

28:58.804 --> 29:01.505
This is Evan. He was Big Mack's
assistant for two years.

29:01.540 --> 29:03.740
Oh, great.
So, you worked with Jennifer?

29:03.775 --> 29:05.709
I miss her.
She was one of a kind.

29:05.743 --> 29:07.411
Was she good at her job?

29:07.445 --> 29:08.745
Yeah. I mean, Big Mack wanted

29:08.780 --> 29:09.813
to replace me with Jennifer
when I left.

29:09.847 --> 29:11.648
Really, now?

29:11.682 --> 29:14.151
-Wait a minute. Aah!
-Aah!

29:14.185 --> 29:16.619
Ahh.

29:19.623 --> 29:21.524
Big Mack?

29:21.558 --> 29:22.858
Big Mack, I hate to bother you,

29:22.893 --> 29:24.627
but I just had to meet
the legend.

29:24.661 --> 29:27.128
No, no, no.
"Legend" makes me feel old.

29:27.163 --> 29:28.796
Oh, well, I -- you know,

29:28.830 --> 29:30.597
I consider myself
a self-made man,

29:30.632 --> 29:32.999
so what you've got going on
here, this is inspiring.

29:33.034 --> 29:35.501
Well, life
has no dress rehearsal, huh?

29:35.535 --> 29:38.136
Copy that.
Can I ask you something?

29:38.170 --> 29:39.737
Can't promise I'll answer.

29:39.771 --> 29:41.005
Is it true
what they say about you?

29:41.039 --> 29:42.573
Any woman, anywhere, anytime?

29:42.607 --> 29:44.807
No, no.
Not any woman, not anytime.

29:44.842 --> 29:46.442
But most, most of the time.

29:46.476 --> 29:48.010
Yeah!
Oh, my God!

29:48.044 --> 29:50.179
I mean, that is beyond the scope
of my imagination.

29:50.213 --> 29:51.780
So -- so, like...

29:51.814 --> 29:54.015
-Even her?
-Uh...

29:54.049 --> 29:57.584
Yep. 1979.

29:57.619 --> 29:59.686
-Look at you.
-Pretty sure, yeah.

29:59.721 --> 30:01.721
-What about Jennifer?
-Who's that?

30:01.755 --> 30:04.190
Jennifer. Jennifer Putnam.
The girl doing the cannonball.

30:04.224 --> 30:06.092
Whoo!

30:06.126 --> 30:07.859
Oh, oh.
You mean peppermint Patty?

30:07.893 --> 30:09.561
Yeah, she had a big bowl of them
on her desk.

30:09.595 --> 30:10.996
Oh, was she your assistant?

30:11.030 --> 30:12.597
No, no, no.
But I wanted her to be.

30:12.632 --> 30:13.931
What happened?

30:13.966 --> 30:15.600
Oh, uh,
I'm a "big picture" guy.

30:15.634 --> 30:17.134
I don't know
what the hell happened.

30:17.169 --> 30:19.036
Katherine said
that she wasn't good, so...

30:19.070 --> 30:20.471
Oh.

30:20.505 --> 30:22.172
-Hey.
-Hey!

30:22.207 --> 30:23.707
You ready to defend
our title in the 3-legged race?

30:23.742 --> 30:25.242
You got it!
Come on. Let's go.

30:25.277 --> 30:27.645
-Nice meeting you.
-You too.

30:29.281 --> 30:31.483
Y-you just talked
to Big Mack.

30:31.517 --> 30:34.253
Uh-huh. You will, too. We're
gonna put him on the stand.

30:34.287 --> 30:39.192
And Big Mack doesn't know as
much about women as he thinks.

30:40.685 --> 30:43.521
I don't know
<i>anything</i> about women.

30:43.555 --> 30:45.590
That is true.

30:47.657 --> 30:50.956
Ah, Mr. Toy.
I do apologize.

30:50.957 --> 30:52.591
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

30:52.625 --> 30:53.825
Oh, no problem.

30:53.860 --> 30:55.393
Ah, please sit down.

30:55.428 --> 30:57.496
Good.

30:57.530 --> 30:58.797
Now, Mr. Toy, look.

30:58.831 --> 31:02.034
I intend
to clear my firm's name.

31:02.068 --> 31:05.904
And to tell you the truth,
I'm fascinated by the council.

31:05.938 --> 31:09.574
And -- and, obviously,
I'm concerned for you.

31:09.608 --> 31:11.542
-Obviously.
-Mm-hmm.

31:11.577 --> 31:13.911
Uh, so, what did you want
to talk about?

31:13.946 --> 31:16.146
The frozen rabbit in your pants.

31:16.181 --> 31:19.049
It wasn't in my pants.
It was in my waistband.

31:19.084 --> 31:20.751
I-I've got a python.

31:20.785 --> 31:24.621
Ohh! Impressive!
Congratulations.

31:24.656 --> 31:27.991
Uh, no, I --
it's a pet. It's a snake.

31:28.026 --> 31:30.794
You know, we have more
in common than you may think.

31:30.829 --> 31:32.496
I had one named Suzy.

31:32.530 --> 31:35.065
Oh, she was aloof,
but I adored her...

31:35.099 --> 31:36.800
Until she escaped.

31:36.834 --> 31:39.770
Uh, but anyway,
that's another story, huh?

31:39.804 --> 31:43.641
Uh, well, I-I feed my
python one thawed rabbit a week.

31:43.676 --> 31:45.510
-Mm-hmm.
-Right?

31:45.544 --> 31:46.811
And I was a day late.

31:46.846 --> 31:48.780
Oh, and I know firsthand,

31:48.815 --> 31:51.616
you can't defrost those
cottontails in the microwave

31:51.651 --> 31:53.018
without the meat
getting stringy!

31:53.052 --> 31:55.487
-Exactly.
-Right?

31:55.521 --> 31:58.757
Right, so I was just jump-starting
the thawing process while I shopped.

31:58.792 --> 32:00.459
I was gonna pay for it, I swear.

32:00.494 --> 32:02.928
And the pet store
across the street,

32:02.963 --> 32:06.766
you know, they're selling
frozen rabbit at half the price.

32:06.800 --> 32:10.971
And we know, don't we, that
pythons will eat anything, Gene.

32:11.005 --> 32:16.711
So I suspect there was
another draw to Han's market

32:16.745 --> 32:19.080
that you're
not telling me about.

32:21.851 --> 32:23.919
Okay. Mr. Mack --

32:23.954 --> 32:27.189
You kissed your client
on the stand. Sit down, Mr. Bash.

32:27.224 --> 32:29.158
Your honor, I think
there's only a slight chance

32:29.192 --> 32:31.594
of him kissing Mr. Mack.

32:31.628 --> 32:32.928
I'll do it.

32:32.963 --> 32:34.963
Mr. Mack...

32:34.997 --> 32:38.132
Is it true you wanted Jennifer
to be your assistant

32:38.167 --> 32:39.901
after Evan resigned?

32:39.935 --> 32:41.502
I made
an offhand remark about it.

32:41.536 --> 32:42.903
What happened?

32:42.938 --> 32:45.739
Ultimately,
I decided against it.

32:45.773 --> 32:47.040
Why?

32:47.075 --> 32:49.075
Because my daughter, Katherine,

32:49.110 --> 32:51.779
said Jennifer wasn't competent.

32:51.813 --> 32:55.049
How would you describe
your relationship with Jennifer?

32:55.084 --> 32:56.585
Were you close?

32:56.619 --> 32:57.886
Not really, but, uh --

32:57.921 --> 32:59.588
But you got along well.

32:59.623 --> 33:01.057
Sure, yeah. She's a good kid.

33:01.091 --> 33:03.527
She's a 27-year-old woman.

33:03.561 --> 33:05.128
Uh-oh.
Did I say something wrong?

33:05.163 --> 33:07.631
I mean, I didn't call her "girl"
or -- or -- or "honey."

33:07.665 --> 33:10.134
I said, "kid,"
like I call my daughter.

33:10.168 --> 33:12.936
So she's like
a daughter to you?

33:14.272 --> 33:16.006
Those are your words.

33:16.040 --> 33:17.608
Actually, they're yours.

33:17.642 --> 33:19.143
You compared her
to your daughter.

33:19.177 --> 33:20.945
If you'd like, I can have
the court reporter read back.

33:20.979 --> 33:23.581
No, no. It's fine.

33:23.615 --> 33:26.551
So, by my account,
the only two women at <i>Stirred</i>

33:26.585 --> 33:28.786
who you haven't had
sexual relations with

33:28.820 --> 33:31.723
are Katherine Mack, your
daughter, and Jennifer Putnam.

33:31.757 --> 33:33.691
-Is that true?
-Objection.

33:33.725 --> 33:35.760
-Relevance, your honor.
-Some leeway.

33:35.794 --> 33:39.330
Overruled.
You may continue.

33:41.133 --> 33:43.134
Not the only ones.

33:43.168 --> 33:46.705
There are a handful in payroll.

33:46.739 --> 33:50.208
Of course there are.
No further questions.

33:53.646 --> 33:56.782
Party planning is a lot
of pressure. Am I right?

33:56.817 --> 33:58.017
I suppose.

33:58.051 --> 33:59.886
Take your dad, for example.

33:59.921 --> 34:01.855
Could you tell the court
some of his requirements

34:01.889 --> 34:03.056
at <i>Stirred</i> events?

34:03.090 --> 34:04.958
I don't know.

34:04.992 --> 34:08.128
Uh, grass-fed Argentine beef
and sustainable caviar?

34:08.161 --> 34:10.362
And the vaporizers.
What kind?

34:10.398 --> 34:12.065
Musk-scented misters.

34:12.100 --> 34:15.369
Right, right,
and he also likes trampolines

34:15.402 --> 34:16.902
and 3-legged races?

34:16.938 --> 34:18.972
Yes and yes.

34:19.005 --> 34:21.208
At Saturday's fundraiser,
did your father ask you

34:21.242 --> 34:22.810
to run the 3-legged race
with him?

34:22.844 --> 34:24.844
I was in heels. I couldn't.

34:24.880 --> 34:28.683
Over 35 years,
how many outdoor functions

34:28.717 --> 34:31.219
would you say you've attended
with your father?

34:31.253 --> 34:33.054
I don't know.

34:33.088 --> 34:34.889
Ballpark?

34:34.924 --> 34:38.927
Uh, we have
2 or 3 a year, so 75?

34:38.962 --> 34:41.297
75?

34:41.331 --> 34:44.234
And has he ever asked you
to run the 3-legged race,

34:44.268 --> 34:46.303
even when you weren't in heels?

34:46.337 --> 34:48.772
I <i>always</i> wear heels.

34:48.806 --> 34:52.376
Who did he ask to run
the race with him on Saturday?

34:54.179 --> 34:55.913
Her.

34:55.947 --> 34:58.983
You mean the plaintiff,
Jennifer Putnam?

34:59.017 --> 35:01.218
Yes.

35:02.954 --> 35:05.723
No more questions, your honor.

35:08.093 --> 35:10.261
Mm.

35:35.174 --> 35:39.010
Oh, uh, s-sorry.
I-I think I have the wrong room.

35:39.044 --> 35:42.913
Oh, Gene. Uh...

35:42.948 --> 35:45.950
Uh, this isn't
a Jackie Chan movie.

35:45.984 --> 35:48.852
Uh, gentlemen,
I'm humbled and grateful

35:48.887 --> 35:52.223
for this audience in front
of the council of elders

35:52.257 --> 35:55.259
on behalf of my good friend,
Gene Toy.

35:55.293 --> 35:59.430
Council of elders?
We're a merchants' association.

35:59.465 --> 36:02.334
Yes, quite.

36:02.368 --> 36:04.036
I'd like to call a witness.

36:04.070 --> 36:05.872
Witness?

36:05.906 --> 36:07.807
No.
Mr. Infeld, council, please.

36:07.842 --> 36:09.142
Tonia?

36:09.176 --> 36:10.844
I'll just take
my punishment and leave.

36:10.879 --> 36:12.379
I believe Tonia
has something to say.

36:12.414 --> 36:13.881
Now, let her speak.

36:13.915 --> 36:15.316
Are you sure?

36:18.419 --> 36:22.255
Dad.
Gene may not be a doctor.

36:22.289 --> 36:25.158
He may not speak
perfect Mandarin.

36:25.192 --> 36:28.861
He might not have a deep voice
or a strong handshake.

36:28.895 --> 36:31.997
He certainly might not
set the world on fire,

36:32.032 --> 36:35.167
but, dad,
he sets world on fire.

36:35.201 --> 36:36.768
And...

36:38.271 --> 36:40.106
...I love him.

36:45.178 --> 36:48.448
See, a left-handed compliment
from the woman of your dreams

36:48.482 --> 36:50.784
is like a shiv
between the third and fourth rib

36:50.818 --> 36:53.787
that just misses your heart.

36:55.057 --> 36:57.358
Tonia, we'll talk
about this at home.

36:57.393 --> 36:59.994
You can't tell me who
to date or who to marry, dad.

37:00.962 --> 37:03.130
Marry?!

37:03.165 --> 37:05.432
I don't want you thinking
about marriage

37:05.466 --> 37:08.902
until after
you graduate college.

37:08.937 --> 37:10.804
I have ambitions for you.

37:10.838 --> 37:13.073
And I know that, dad.

37:13.107 --> 37:16.509
Just because I love Gene doesn't
mean I'm gonna forget all that.

37:16.543 --> 37:18.144
If I may.

37:18.178 --> 37:22.348
Uh, Mr. Han, it seems
that we've locked horns

37:22.382 --> 37:24.817
over a youthful fling.

37:24.852 --> 37:28.255
Gene Toy came to your market,

37:28.289 --> 37:31.058
even though your frozen rabbit
is, by the way,

37:31.092 --> 37:33.860
not competitively priced.

37:33.895 --> 37:37.264
He respected your edict
not to date Tonia.

37:37.298 --> 37:40.334
He just wanted the opportunity
to see her,

37:40.368 --> 37:46.339
to watch her skin a goat
or to hear her laugh.

37:48.376 --> 37:51.979
Gentlemen, please allow Gene Toy

37:52.013 --> 37:57.283
to continue to live his dream
here in Chinatown.

38:02.856 --> 38:04.290
Not only did Big Mack

38:04.324 --> 38:07.193
ignore his biological daughter,
Katherine,

38:07.227 --> 38:10.497
but almost as hurtful,
he took a shine to Jennifer.

38:10.531 --> 38:14.600
As we've proven, our client's
beauty was a liability.

38:14.635 --> 38:17.437
She stole the spotlight
from Katherine,

38:17.472 --> 38:20.340
and she became like
another daughter to Big Mack.

38:20.375 --> 38:23.977
In the end,
ladies and gentlemen,

38:24.011 --> 38:28.114
our client was, indeed, fired
for being too beautiful.

38:45.266 --> 38:49.169
You can take shots
at me all you want,

38:49.203 --> 38:53.306
but when you start attacking my
daughter, I have to intervene.

38:53.341 --> 38:55.208
I raised her.

38:55.242 --> 38:58.512
Sort of.

38:58.546 --> 39:01.582
This is my fault.
I want it settled now.

39:01.616 --> 39:03.517
Well, see, our client
doesn't want a settlement.

39:03.552 --> 39:06.220
-She wants a jury verdict.
-I don't.

39:06.255 --> 39:09.291
Jennifer, what do you want?

39:09.325 --> 39:11.494
I want my job back.

39:11.528 --> 39:13.029
You got it.

39:13.063 --> 39:14.997
You'll be my assistant.
How about that?

39:15.032 --> 39:17.200
And one more thing.

39:17.234 --> 39:19.401
Yes?

39:19.436 --> 39:21.404
I want the company's
plastic-surgery fund

39:21.438 --> 39:23.139
to be sent to Operation Smile.

39:23.173 --> 39:25.575
That way,
children with cleft palates

39:25.609 --> 39:29.579
can find success and acceptance,
just like Joaquin Phoenix.

39:29.613 --> 39:32.348
Done.

39:34.318 --> 39:36.419
Hey, I'm a big fa--

39:36.453 --> 39:38.187
-What'd I tell you?
-I know.

39:38.221 --> 39:39.955
-Okay.
-End zone.

39:48.031 --> 39:50.198
All right, you're all set.
You're online.

39:50.233 --> 39:52.034
Yeah! Gene!

39:52.068 --> 39:54.202
Thank you.

39:54.237 --> 39:56.704
Thank <i>you,</i> huh? If you guys
hadn't screwed everything up,

39:56.739 --> 39:58.540
I would've given up
and lost Tonia.

39:58.574 --> 40:00.441
Ah, you're welcome.

40:00.476 --> 40:02.343
Oh, and your boss should
really start his own religion.

40:02.377 --> 40:04.345
He amazing.
You know, I'm just glad

40:04.380 --> 40:06.381
you've been returned
to full Chinatown status.

40:06.415 --> 40:08.016
Need a refill?

40:08.050 --> 40:10.618
-Yes. Yeah.
-Fill her up?

40:13.289 --> 40:15.957
Are you guys squatters,
or do you actually live here?

40:15.992 --> 40:18.427
-Wow! Look who it is.
-Wow.

40:18.461 --> 40:20.462
Now only do we live here,
we thrive here, brother.

40:20.496 --> 40:22.364
What you got there?

40:22.398 --> 40:24.232
I'm sorry
you have to give it up.

40:24.267 --> 40:27.169
Well, it's not the guitar,
it's the guitarist.

40:27.203 --> 40:29.171
And that guitar
is for that guitarist.

40:29.205 --> 40:31.240
-Double or nothing?
-You're hysterical.

40:31.274 --> 40:34.176
-That's adorable.
-Whew!

40:34.210 --> 40:37.079
You look like a man
who could use a beverage.

40:37.113 --> 40:38.480
Ever heard of beer Jenga?

40:38.514 --> 40:40.382
-Is it an import?
-Oh, God.

40:40.416 --> 40:41.983
Kiss it. Just kiss it.

40:42.018 --> 40:43.719
You're a naughty
little minx, aren't you?

40:43.753 --> 40:45.520
Cannonball! Whoo!

40:45.555 --> 40:48.123
She knows
that's a hot tub, right?

40:48.157 --> 40:50.759
Come on, guys, lets go! Let's
do this. Let's go. Let's go.

40:50.794 --> 40:53.162
All right, am I gonna
have to carry you punks again?

40:53.196 --> 40:55.231
-Are you ready?
-I get the sniper rifle.

40:55.265 --> 40:56.565
Where's my grenade launcher?

40:56.600 --> 40:58.134
Whoa!
