that I kind of felt like | was
the one taking care of her.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.440
Must've been tough.

16:30.198 --> 16:31.780
Yeah.

16:33.117 --> 16:35.404
How about your dad?
You get along with him okay?

16:37.205 --> 16:40.197
| don't know. | mean, I only
moved up here about a year ago.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.411
It's not like we even
know each other that well.

16:42.710 --> 16:44.417
Yeah.
Mmm.

16:45.129 --> 16:47.587
How about you?
You have parents?

16:48.299 --> 16:49.630
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

16:49.717 --> 16:52.175
| mean, that
you see and stuff.

16:52.261 --> 16:55.094
Well, they're back East,
but I talk to them all the time.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.513
Oh, they're still together?

16:57.600 --> 16:59.557
They're weird, though.

16:59.644 --> 17:02.432
| mean, they're totally
cool, totally together.

17:02.522 --> 17:06.015
It's just that they've never had a
disagreement about anything more serious than

17:06.818 --> 17:09.560
whether it's gonna be mashed
or Stove Top, or tea or coffee.

17:09.654 --> 17:10.644
(GIGGLES)

17:10.738 --> 17:12.319
Kinda crazy.

17:15.617 --> 17:16.779
What?

17:17.453 --> 17:18.568
Nothing.

17:18.663 --> 17:22.281
That was not "nothing" going on
behind those beautiful eyes of yours.

17:23.084 --> 17:24.540
Tell me.

17:26.295 --> 17:29.378
| was just thinking that

17:29.465 --> 17:33.550
you're not at all what | expected
you to be the first time I saw you.

17:33.928 --> 17:35.839
How so?

17:37.765 --> 17:39.722
| don't know.
You're just...

17:41.060 --> 17:42.971
You're sweet.

17:45.189 --> 17:48.807
What? You're the one
that's hiding something.

17:50.653 --> 17:55.238
It's just that I was taught that if
something seems too good to be true,

17:55.658 --> 17:57.774
then it probably isn't.

17:57.869 --> 17:59.610
Yeah.

17:59.704 --> 18:03.322
So far what I know about
you is you're beautiful

18:04.542 --> 18:06.783
and incredibly perceptive.

18:06.878 --> 18:10.667
| just need to know, like, one
flaw so I can believe the rest.

18:11.007 --> 18:12.497
Got a week?

18:13.384 --> 18:15.716
| got all the
time in the world.

18:19.182 --> 18:21.799
Oh. David.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.976
| gotta go. My
curfew's at midnight.

18:33.696 --> 18:36.279
All the time in the world.

19:01.182 --> 19:02.764
David.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.639
I'm sorry.

19:06.896 --> 19:09.354
| guess
you found my flaw.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.647
That's not a flaw.

19:11.734 --> 19:14.772
That's one more perfect
thing for me to admire.

19:16.197 --> 19:18.188
And respect.

19:19.784 --> 19:21.741
And wait for.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.696
Well, the least you could
have done was call, Nicole.

19:25.790 --> 19:28.828
| was sitting here for two hours
imagining God knows what.

19:28.918 --> 19:30.750
Laura, I can't help it
if my watch broke.

19:32.255 --> 19:36.214
| mean, how would | even notice
unless I was staring at it every second?

19:36.300 --> 19:38.917
Go to bed, Nicole. We'll
deal with this tomorrow.

19:39.262 --> 19:40.923
Laura...
I'm angry, Nicole.

19:41.097 --> 19:42.713
Just go to bed.

19:44.725 --> 19:47.342
And take off your makeup.
You look like a slut.

19:49.438 --> 19:50.940
(SCOFFS)

19:55.236 --> 19:56.522
Mr. Walker.

19:56.612 --> 19:57.943
Larry.

20:00.741 --> 20:04.200
So, 2:00 a.m.
Am I missing something?

20:06.122 --> 20:08.284
Come on, Nicky.
Help me out.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.285
You were kidnapped
by aliens.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.834
They tried to take you to
their planet, but you escaped

20:12.920 --> 20:15.127
and hitchhiked
back from Pluto.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.718
So who's this guy
you were with?

20:23.598 --> 20:24.963
Just a guy.

20:26.142 --> 20:27.974
Is he a good guy?

20:28.060 --> 20:29.892
He's good to his car.

20:30.396 --> 20:31.932
You'd appreciate that.

20:32.023 --> 20:34.731
Well, that's a start.
Maybe I should meet him.

20:34.817 --> 20:37.730
Dad, I just met him. | don't even
know if I'm gonna see him again.

20:37.820 --> 20:39.185
Oh.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.775
So”?

20:41.866 --> 20:43.152
Right.

20:43.826 --> 20:46.067
All right, here's the deal.

20:47.288 --> 20:50.576
Kitchen duty and yard work
for two weeks. No exceptions.

20:50.666 --> 20:54.125
And no subcontracting
out to Tobias.

20:54.211 --> 20:55.997
Is that fair?
Do I have a choice?

20:56.088 --> 20:57.078
No.

20:57.173 --> 20:58.834
| guess
it's fair.

20:58.925 --> 21:02.043
And I want you
to apologize to Laura.

21:03.346 --> 21:08.136
Yeah. I'll apologize to her when she
apologizes to me for calling me a slut.

21:11.646 --> 21:13.353
(STEVE BRUSHING TEETH)
You were too easy on her.

21:13.439 --> 21:14.975
She should have
been grounded.

21:15.066 --> 21:17.148
STEVE: She knows
she screwed up.

21:17.234 --> 21:19.896
It's all easy fixes
with you, Steve.

21:19.987 --> 21:21.443
You give her
whatever she wants,

21:21.530 --> 21:23.908
like you're forever
trying to make it up to her.

21:24.075 --> 21:25.440
Please, Laura.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.866
It's gonna blow up
in your face, Steve.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.570
Everybody needs rules.

21:29.664 --> 21:32.873
She'd respect you more if you
laid it out and played it straight.

21:33.167 --> 21:36.410
Straight, huh? Is that why
you called her a slut?

21:38.547 --> 21:40.959
| said she looked
like a slut.

21:41.050 --> 21:44.793
She had about two gallons of makeup
on and that's exactly what she looked like.

21:44.887 --> 21:47.219
Shitty choice of words,
don't you think?

21:48.516 --> 21:49.722
Maybe.

22:54.165 --> 22:57.157
You know, every part
of you tastes so good.

23:04.133 --> 23:06.295
Nicole?
Yeah?

23:06.385 --> 23:09.377
| wanna meet your family.

23:09.472 --> 23:10.758
Really?

23:10.848 --> 23:12.839
Yeah. Will that
be okay?

23:13.267 --> 23:14.507
Yeah.

23:17.021 --> 23:18.682
NICOLE: Dad,
meet David McCall.

23:20.232 --> 23:23.645
Mr. Walker.
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

23:23.819 --> 23:25.560
Same here, David.

23:25.654 --> 23:28.897
Hey, Toby, right?
What's up, big guy?

23:28.991 --> 23:32.029
This must be
the savage beast Kaiser.

23:33.454 --> 23:34.535
(CHUCKLES)

23:34.622 --> 23:36.078
That means
he likes you.

23:36.165 --> 23:38.577
Yeah? Tell him
the feeling is mutual.

23:38.667 --> 23:41.125
You know, you look bigger
than your sister described.

23:41.212 --> 23:44.580
Or maybe you just grew
since yesterday. Which one?

23:44.673 --> 23:47.381
So, David, you're not in
school with Nicole, are you?

23:47.843 --> 23:48.924
Uh...

23:49.011 --> 23:51.252
No, sir. But maybe
U-Dub in the fall.

23:51.347 --> 23:53.930
I'm just kind of exploring
my options, | guess.

23:54.016 --> 23:57.008
Nicole, remember you gotta help
me plant these trees before you leave.

23:57.103 --> 23:59.686
NICOLE: But |
gotta get changed.

23:59.772 --> 24:02.264
Well, you knew it was
one of your chores.

24:02.358 --> 24:04.440
Excuse me.
It's Laura, right?

24:04.527 --> 24:07.019

24:07.488 --> 24:09.104

interfere or anything,

24:09.198 --> 24:10.780
but it so happens | work
summers in a nursery.

24:10.866 --> 24:12.573
I'd be more than happy
to give you a hand.

24:12.701 --> 24:13.862
Can I help, too?

24:13.953 --> 24:16.945
| couldn't do it
without you, partner.

24:17.706 --> 24:20.084
Okay. Come on.
Grab the big one.

24:20.167 --> 24:22.750
DAVID: See, the main thing is
the moisture content of the soil

24:22.837 --> 24:24.327
when you first plant it.
Uh-huh.

24:24.421 --> 24:26.958
These guys' roots are really
sensitive for about ten days or so.

24:27.049 --> 24:31.213
Hmm, well, you certainly learned a
lot during your summer, didn't you?

24:39.728 --> 24:42.686
DAVID: Is there some place
| can get cleaned up?

24:42.773 --> 24:43.808
LAURA: I don't know.

24:43.899 --> 24:47.483
| think some hard-earned dirt under
a man's fingernails can be attractive.

24:47.570 --> 24:49.060

| shouldn't wash.

on your left.

you, am [|?

24:56.495 --> 24:57.610
No, no. Go ahead.

24:57.705 --> 24:59.412
Thank you.

come in here?

25:03.085 --> 25:04.416
I'll be right out.

Tell me about life.

25:07.673 --> 25:08.663

25:09.133 --> 25:12.376
Mr. Walker, I'm sure you know
a lot more about life than I do.

25:12.469 --> 25:15.086
| wouldn't be so sure. | get
surprised at least once a day.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.343
That's the fun part
though, isn't it, Mr. Walker?

25:17.433 --> 25:18.514
Depends, David.

25:18.601 --> 25:21.593
Kinda cuts both ways.
You just never know.

25:21.687 --> 25:22.722
Two minutes.

trash bags have to go out.

25:25.107 --> 25:26.097
You're not
getting out of that.

25:26.192 --> 25:27.307
NICOLE: All right.

25:27.401 --> 25:29.938
You should come with
us to the Orbit, Mr. Walker.

right there.

25:37.077 --> 25:40.911
Come on, Steve.
You could play pinball.

25:41.665 --> 25:44.157
You could ride
the bumper cars.

you throw the ball at something.
