02:57.486 --> 02:59.197
You okay?

03:22.261 --> 03:23.554
Shit.

03:31.020 --> 03:33.022
That guy you fried
with your clever little trap?

03:33.106 --> 03:35.566
- That was our cousin.
- Cuz.

03:36.192 --> 03:38.862
That's Brother.
Sonny.

03:40.488 --> 03:42.281
You can call me Father.

03:43.449 --> 03:46.619
And you two?
You two are the kids.

03:46.702 --> 03:49.538
- What do you want?
- Speak when spoken to.

03:49.622 --> 03:50.789
Where are your scrips?

03:50.874 --> 03:53.334
No need to rush, Brother.
Let's eat first.

03:53.417 --> 03:56.963
- We shouldn't linger.
- We haven't eaten in two days.

03:57.046 --> 03:59.841
This fool and his money
aren't going anywhere.

03:59.924 --> 04:01.550
He's got apples.

04:01.634 --> 04:03.594
Nobody has apples anymore.

04:03.677 --> 04:04.888
He does.

04:05.889 --> 04:07.390
Okay. All right.

04:15.106 --> 04:16.315
Go on.

04:33.624 --> 04:35.293
Were you brats playing doctor?

04:35.376 --> 04:37.128
You touch her and you die.

04:42.008 --> 04:43.968
Give me your scrips.

04:44.052 --> 04:46.137
But hold back on me?

04:51.350 --> 04:53.144
You got five minutes.

05:00.276 --> 05:03.112
- Who are they?
- They followed you.

05:03.196 --> 05:04.405
No one followed me, Ren.

05:04.488 --> 05:05.949
- I made sure.
- Nobody knew I was here except you.

05:06.032 --> 05:08.409
You show up late last night,
then those guys show up?

05:08.492 --> 05:10.536
You found me.

05:12.538 --> 05:13.539
Ren, shh.

05:14.832 --> 05:16.084
You told me to come.

05:16.167 --> 05:17.835
That's not what I meant.
It's not your fault.

05:20.171 --> 05:21.464
What are you doing?

05:27.761 --> 05:29.763
They had you under surveillance.
I should've known.

05:29.847 --> 05:31.849
What? Who?

05:36.229 --> 05:37.938
Ren, you're gonna get us killed!

05:54.288 --> 05:55.623
Be careful.

06:04.007 --> 06:06.550
- We don't have much time.
- Time for... for what?

06:06.634 --> 06:08.469
Those guys want more than just scrips.

06:10.429 --> 06:12.848
What? Ren, listen to me, okay?

06:12.931 --> 06:15.309
There's three of them,
and they've got a gun.

06:16.352 --> 06:18.521
- Do you recognize him?
- No.

06:18.604 --> 06:21.149
I think he was there
when Torus tried to arrest me.

06:24.152 --> 06:26.195
Don't! Don't touch it.

06:26.279 --> 06:27.780
It's rigged with 20,000 volts.

06:29.782 --> 06:31.075
It's how this guy died.

06:31.159 --> 06:33.244
- What is it?
- The ARQ.

06:34.245 --> 06:35.246
The ARQ?

06:35.329 --> 06:37.540
Arcing recursive quine.

06:37.623 --> 06:39.042
It's what they're after.

06:39.125 --> 06:41.627
No, they're starving like everybody else.

06:41.710 --> 06:45.756
So unless this thing is a food processor,
I doubt they give a shit about it.

06:45.839 --> 06:48.384
No, Torus sent those bastards
to take it back.

06:51.804 --> 06:53.639
This is what you stole from Torus?

06:53.722 --> 06:55.891
I didn't steal it.
I built it.

06:57.435 --> 06:58.477
What's it do?

06:58.561 --> 07:00.854
It's a hyper-efficient energy turbine.

07:00.938 --> 07:02.523
A generator. That's it?

07:05.276 --> 07:07.695
I know that look.

07:08.696 --> 07:10.323
You're not telling me something.

07:12.783 --> 07:14.743
- Lock the door behind me.
- Ren.

07:14.827 --> 07:15.953
Ren, don't go.

07:16.037 --> 07:18.872
This door is reinforced.
It would take ZMPs to break it down.

07:19.873 --> 07:21.459
You're gonna get us killed.

07:22.960 --> 07:24.795
I shouldn't have contacted you, Hannah.

07:25.713 --> 07:26.755
Don't say that.

07:27.673 --> 07:29.383
I just needed to see you again.

07:30.676 --> 07:33.011
- Stay here.
- Don't go.

09:20.328 --> 09:21.454
They're coming.

09:21.537 --> 09:22.996
Who?

09:57.030 --> 09:59.116
Were you brats playing doctor?

10:02.035 --> 10:03.787
Touch her and you die.

10:06.665 --> 10:08.083
Whoa.

10:08.166 --> 10:09.668
So menacing.

10:12.630 --> 10:13.964

10:34.109 --> 10:36.320
Stop. They'll be right back.

10:37.613 --> 10:40.366
- We've got time.
- What?

10:41.992 --> 10:43.786

10:46.664 --> 10:49.583
Okay. Hannah, listen to me, okay?

10:49.667 --> 10:52.002
Right now, this very moment,
it's happened before.

10:52.085 --> 10:53.462
Twice, I think.

10:53.546 --> 10:55.213
- What are you talking about?
- Shit.

10:59.718 --> 11:01.011
What the hell are you doing?

11:02.179 --> 11:03.472
Ren, you're going to get us killed.

11:07.685 --> 11:09.478
I don't want you to get hurt.

11:14.900 --> 11:18.737
Okay, listen to me. There's three of them,

11:21.365 --> 11:24.034
Hannah, listen to me.

11:24.117 --> 11:27.663
Today is repeating.
Tell me you remember.

11:27.746 --> 11:29.039
Come on, you have to remember.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.293
Have you lost your fucking mind?

11:34.753 --> 11:36.213
- No. No.
- What?

11:48.058 --> 11:49.059
Incredible.

11:49.142 --> 11:52.563
I think... I think the ARQ
is causing time to loop.

11:54.189 --> 11:55.858
Okay, Ren, you're talking crazy.

11:58.026 --> 12:00.696
No. No. No, no, no.
I remember.

12:01.321 --> 12:05.033
Okay, this guy, um,
he's got a big scar across his face.

12:07.244 --> 12:11.874
Prick who calls himself Father...
Uh, brown eyes, a little bit of stubble.

12:11.957 --> 12:15.252
The big guy?
Brother? Dark hair, baby face.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.921
Sonny?
Full beard, shaved head.

12:18.881 --> 12:21.884
How did you know that?

12:21.967 --> 12:24.970
Because it's happened before.
Twice.

12:27.556 --> 12:29.224
Don't touch it.

12:32.936 --> 12:34.980
What else do you remember?

12:36.649 --> 12:37.941
Nothing...

12:38.025 --> 12:39.818
except that Father guy killed me.

12:45.282 --> 12:46.825
Well, how come you remember and I don't?

12:48.160 --> 12:49.161
I don't know.

12:49.244 --> 12:52.289
Oh, and what about those idiots
with the code names?

12:52.372 --> 12:55.459
- They don't remember either?
- Just me.

12:55.543 --> 12:59.755

pull this pin,
dump this canister into the chute.

He still might.

Hey.

Besides fry people.

19:29.812 --> 19:31.688
It's just a science experiment.

19:31.772 --> 19:35.650
That's right. He used to be
a military engineer for Torus.

19:35.733 --> 19:37.652
So is that a weapon or something?

19:37.735 --> 19:39.237

I told you last night.

20:41.299 --> 20:42.509
Tell me again.

20:43.510 --> 20:46.054
Now? Why?

20:46.930 --> 20:48.473
Ren, untie me.

20:49.307 --> 20:50.433
What?

21:00.402 --> 21:02.946
Torus agents interrogated me
for three days.

21:03.864 --> 21:06.366
Then what?

21:06.449 --> 21:07.784
Uh, they let me go

21:07.868 --> 21:12.622
after they knew I had nothing to do
with you stealing their scrips.

21:15.876 --> 21:18.045
And that you left without telling me.

21:22.883 --> 21:25.718
<i>Listen carefully.
Torus... Hannah!</i>

21:25.802 --> 21:27.054
<i>I got this!</i>

21:27.679 --> 21:29.681
Ren, un... untie me.

21:33.143 --> 21:34.144
What is it?

21:36.729 --> 21:39.942
And Torus let you go?
Just like that?

21:41.443 --> 21:42.735
Not just like that.

21:43.653 --> 21:47.115
They took away my citizenship, our home.

21:49.117 --> 21:52.162
They put me in a refugee camp
for six months.

21:53.788 --> 21:57.709
I didn't know if you were dead,
or if you had just left me for dead.

22:00.378 --> 22:03.048
I spent a year torturing myself,

22:03.131 --> 22:05.883
feeling guilty that I got away
and you didn't.

22:18.521 --> 22:19.814
They have a gun.

22:20.732 --> 22:22.317
We should do what they say.

22:23.485 --> 22:24.777
I already tried that.

22:26.113 --> 22:29.532
<i>Up north, Torus
security forces battle Bloc paramilitaries</i>

22:29.616 --> 22:31.951
<i>over the Great Slave Lake Oil Refinery.</i>

22:32.035 --> 22:35.455
<i>The refinery borders
the Arctic Parallel neutral zone.</i>

22:35.538 --> 22:37.749
<i>Torus executives
accuse the Arctic Parallel</i>

22:37.832 --> 22:39.876
<i>of providing a safe haven
for Bloc leaders.</i>

22:39.959 --> 22:43.796
Man, why you always
gotta listen to this propaganda?

22:43.880 --> 22:45.882
Know thy enemy, my brother.

22:45.965 --> 22:48.551
Yeah, well,
the Pope tells it like it really is.

22:53.390 --> 22:56.768
<i>Those who can't remember
the past are condemned to repeat it.</i>

23:09.322 --> 23:10.865
Are you okay?

23:13.118 --> 23:14.827
Those guys hurt my back.

23:14.911 --> 23:16.746
There's a bag up there.
Can you reach it?

23:17.414 --> 23:18.790
Yeah, sure.

23:41.563 --> 23:43.106
My supervisors called me a fraud

23:43.190 --> 23:46.443
when I told them the ARQ
was generating limitless energy.

23:47.319 --> 23:50.238
I couldn't really blame them, though.
Perpetual motion's a myth.

23:53.491 --> 23:55.410
Then Torus seized the ARQ.

23:55.493 --> 23:58.371
Now why take something that didn't work?

23:58.455 --> 24:01.666
Because it does.
They want it back.

24:01.749 --> 24:04.794
Torus wants the ARQ for their war machine.

24:04.877 --> 24:07.630
You're crazy.
You've gone fucking crazy.

24:07.714 --> 24:10.092
Maybe.
It doesn't mean I'm wrong.

24:12.677 --> 24:14.721
I know everything, Hannah.

24:14.804 --> 24:19.142
Your boyfriend,
stealing my scrips for the Bloc...

24:21.311 --> 24:22.687
Mother.

24:25.565 --> 24:26.858
How?

24:26.941 --> 24:28.901
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

24:36.909 --> 24:39.996
Are you really working for the Bloc,
or did Torus turn you?

24:47.962 --> 24:49.088
Bloc.

24:50.548 --> 24:52.259
We don't want your stupid machine.

24:54.261 --> 24:57.222
- We came for your scrips.
- Right.

24:57.305 --> 24:59.682
Sorry. You're a freedom fighter now.

24:59.766 --> 25:03.019
I'm just some fool engineer
trying to solve the world's energy crisis.

25:03.102 --> 25:05.647
And all this time I thought
you were just a self-serving thief.

25:05.730 --> 25:07.524
I don't even know who you are anymore.

25:07.607 --> 25:08.733
Yeah, that's right.

25:10.568 --> 25:11.694
You don't.

25:13.696 --> 25:15.072
Because you got away.

25:23.665 --> 25:27.710
They kept the lights on
while I tried to sleep.

25:28.628 --> 25:30.880
Kept me in darkness while I was awake.

25:32.340 --> 25:38.638
They played the same Christmas song
over and over.

25:42.350 --> 25:44.018
It never stopped.

25:45.895 --> 25:47.063
I'm sorry.

25:47.689 --> 25:49.899
You don't get to be sorry.

25:49.982 --> 25:52.485
- You're too late for sorry.
- I never...

25:52.569 --> 25:55.905
I never stopped thinking about you,
Hannah. I looked for you every day.

25:55.988 --> 25:57.449
I hacked into every database I could,

25:57.532 --> 26:00.535
tapped every network,
monitored every registry.

26:00.618 --> 26:03.371
Finding you was the only thing
that kept me going.

26:06.458 --> 26:07.875
I still hate you.

26:10.253 --> 26:11.379
Okay.

26:17.051 --> 26:18.636
So you're just gonna kill us now?

26:19.804 --> 26:22.139
- Just them.
- Ren, please.

26:23.266 --> 26:24.934
Nobody has to get hurt.

26:30.106 --> 26:31.148
We do it my way.

26:40.950 --> 26:43.202
<i>...what happened
to continental Australia</i>

26:43.286 --> 26:45.955
<i>will happen to the entire planet.</i>

26:47.457 --> 26:48.833
<i>It will be 10,000 years...</i>

26:48.916 --> 26:50.543
- Jeez.
- What the hell you doing?

26:50.627 --> 26:54.839
<i>...before anyone can step foot
on that radioactive rubble again.</i>

26:56.424 --> 26:58.635
Shoot me, we all die.

27:01.346 --> 27:02.430
They're bluffing.

27:11.773 --> 27:14.734
Hannah, baby, don't do this.
I trusted you.

27:14.817 --> 27:17.194
Ren's keeping half his scrips.
We get the other half.

27:17.279 --> 27:19.822
- Nobody gets hurt this way.
- No, wait.

27:19.906 --> 27:21.073
Hannah.

27:22.033 --> 27:24.369
Come with me.
We can start over.

27:24.452 --> 27:26.120
Okay? Do it right this time.
We'll head north.

27:26.203 --> 27:28.915
No Torus, no Bloc.
Just us.

27:31.584 --> 27:35.046
You should eat.
There's food in the kitchen. Just...

27:35.129 --> 27:37.214
Just think about it, okay?

27:40.885 --> 27:42.219
Hannah!

28:01.113 --> 28:02.114
Well...

28:03.575 --> 28:07.329
aren't we just one big happy family?

28:10.457 --> 28:12.166
You killed me.

28:17.296 --> 28:18.798
You punched me in the ear.

28:18.881 --> 28:20.842
I meant... I meant to hit you in the face.

28:20.925 --> 28:22.885
Huh, like this?

28:30.477 --> 28:32.854
Hannah's coming with me.

28:35.106 --> 28:36.358
Giving us your blessing?

28:39.068 --> 28:42.489
- She won't go with you.
- She will.

28:43.155 --> 28:44.407
I know Hannah.

28:44.491 --> 28:46.326
Then you also know that she hates you.

28:54.876 --> 28:56.168
Stop!

29:05.762 --> 29:08.097
I need a few hours
to download the data and pack up the ARQ.

29:08.180 --> 29:09.766
You can't go with him, Hannah.

29:09.849 --> 29:11.476
His mind's gone sour.

29:12.352 --> 29:14.979
We'll hook up with a migrant caravan,
head to the Arctic Parallel.

29:15.062 --> 29:16.856
I can hack weather drones
so we avoid flash...

29:16.939 --> 29:18.315
I can't go with you.

29:20.735 --> 29:21.819
I can't.

29:27.659 --> 29:28.868
I'm keeping my scrips.

29:29.619 --> 29:30.745
That wasn't the deal.

29:31.704 --> 29:32.872
Well, the deal's changed.

29:34.457 --> 29:35.500
Ren, please.

29:35.583 --> 29:38.753
This is bigger than us.
This is about winning the war.

29:38.836 --> 29:39.879
The war is over.

29:39.962 --> 29:41.631
Torus is gonna win.
The Bloc is doomed.

29:41.714 --> 29:43.425
And you are wasting your time.

29:44.842 --> 29:45.927
Maybe.

29:47.011 --> 29:48.262
But I have to try.

29:52.642 --> 29:55.311
We need your scrips.
All of them.

29:58.064 --> 29:59.065
Now!

29:59.982 --> 30:01.526
You're not gonna shoot me.

30:04.904 --> 30:06.072
You're right.

30:08.324 --> 30:09.492
You're just being ridiculous.

30:10.410 --> 30:12.454
Okay. Okay. Okay. Just...

30:24.006 --> 30:25.633
I shot you.

30:25.717 --> 30:27.259
Wait, you remember?

31:22.273 --> 31:23.858
Were you brats playing doctor?

31:23.941 --> 31:26.653
Oh, yeah.
All night long.

31:33.450 --> 31:35.161
Give me your scrips.

31:36.913 --> 31:38.665
But hold back on me?

31:49.341 --> 31:51.135
You got five minutes.

31:58.392 --> 32:00.687
You do remember.

32:01.771 --> 32:03.397
Is this a dream?

32:03.480 --> 32:05.775
It was a dream, right? Or...

32:05.858 --> 32:08.903
is this a dream right now? I...

32:08.986 --> 32:10.029
It's not a dream.

32:10.112 --> 32:11.405
- No.
- Today is repeating.

32:11.488 --> 32:15.326
No, I have to get out of here.

32:15.409 --> 32:18.746
- Ren, I can't. I...
- Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

32:18.830 --> 32:20.540
Everything's gonna be okay.

32:24.586 --> 32:26.128
How is this happening?

32:27.088 --> 32:28.255
The ARQ.

32:29.173 --> 32:30.717
How many times do you remember?

32:33.427 --> 32:34.511
Just one.

32:34.596 --> 32:37.014
But it feels like more.

32:37.098 --> 32:38.432
That's because it is.

32:42.019 --> 32:43.520
Great.

32:43.605 --> 32:45.231
Okay, you see these time logs?

32:45.314 --> 32:46.983
These are the four loops
we've gone through.

32:47.066 --> 32:50.319
They always begin at 6:11
and end at 9:25.

32:51.445 --> 32:54.323
And this last time log,
that's happening right now.

32:54.406 --> 32:56.117
So we've looped five times?

32:56.200 --> 32:58.077
- Yeah.
- How? Why?

33:00.955 --> 33:02.206
Okay.

33:03.082 --> 33:07.253
Okay, if, uh, this line is time,
this is when the loop begins.

33:07.336 --> 33:11.674
At 6:11 a.m.,
Cuz electrocuted himself on the ARQ.

33:11.758 --> 33:14.301
This caused forward time
to bend back on itself,

33:14.385 --> 33:16.387
creating a closed-time loop.

33:18.806 --> 33:20.224
And the day repeats.

33:20.307 --> 33:24.270
Time resets every three hours,
14 minutes and 15 seconds.

33:27.774 --> 33:29.233
How does the ARQ work?

33:30.652 --> 33:31.861
Um... Okay.

33:31.944 --> 33:34.864
I mean... I mean, essentially,
these fuel cells power the ARQ.

33:35.657 --> 33:38.910
In turn, the ARQ recharges the fuel cells.

33:38.993 --> 33:41.871
It never needs an external power source,

33:41.954 --> 33:44.581
but... how it's looping time,
I have no idea.

33:45.332 --> 33:48.628
An unlimited energy machine

33:48.711 --> 33:51.798
that also produces unlimited time?

33:51.881 --> 33:53.382
No wonder Torus wants it back.

33:53.465 --> 33:55.885
Not unlimited time.
The same amount of time over and over.

33:56.678 --> 33:59.847
The loops always reset at 9:25.

33:59.931 --> 34:01.891
What happened
when the previous loop reset,

34:01.974 --> 34:04.268
shortly after you shot me?

34:04.351 --> 34:06.395
- It was an accident.
- What happened?

34:06.478 --> 34:09.565
I untied everyone, uh, a gun went off,

34:09.649 --> 34:12.193
and then I woke up in bed next to you.
That's it. That's all I remember.

34:12.275 --> 34:13.485
Sonny probably shot you.

34:14.360 --> 34:15.862
Or maybe your boyfriend.

34:15.947 --> 34:17.447
Grimm wouldn't do that.

34:19.574 --> 34:20.617
Do you love him?

34:23.245 --> 34:25.496
Grimm was the one who helped me survive.

34:26.373 --> 34:27.875
I owe him.

34:28.625 --> 34:31.337
So he's the reason
you joined up with the Bloc?

34:32.295 --> 34:35.257
Five months in Torus custody
was pretty convincing.

34:38.469 --> 34:40.387
Ren, it was my idea to rob you.

34:42.056 --> 34:43.474
I was angry.

34:47.436 --> 34:48.938
But I also wanted to see you.

34:50.940 --> 34:53.192
To make sure you were okay.
That's the truth.

34:56.487 --> 34:58.530
Hannah, just come with me.

34:58.614 --> 35:01.617
Ren, there is a war on.
You come with me.

35:01.701 --> 35:03.745
Oh, my God.
To the Bloc? Come on.

35:03.828 --> 35:06.205
You say you wanna solve
the world's energy crisis,

35:06.288 --> 35:08.457
- but you just wanna run away.
- Yes, with you.

35:08.540 --> 35:10.918
No, it's time we end this.

35:12.879 --> 35:14.671
Fine. Fine.

35:14.756 --> 35:16.924
- Fine, shut down the ARQ.
- No.

35:17.842 --> 35:19.719
No, not until we're in control.

35:19.802 --> 35:22.429
If we shut down the ARQ
and Sonny kills either one of us...

35:22.513 --> 35:25.391
- We're dead for good.
- Which is why we need to kill them first.

35:25.474 --> 35:28.060
No. They're not murderers.

35:28.144 --> 35:30.104
Sonny is. He will shoot me.
That's how it plays out.

35:30.187 --> 35:32.398
Then I will make sure that he can't.

35:32.481 --> 35:35.234
They're my subordinates.
Ren, they will do what I say.

35:35.317 --> 35:36.402
Even Sonny?

35:37.028 --> 35:40.782
Ren, please.
I don't want anybody else to get hurt.

35:43.659 --> 35:45.411
This is gonna work.

35:45.494 --> 35:47.413
Just not too tight, okay?

35:48.414 --> 35:49.749
Trust me.

36:08.976 --> 36:11.771
Hey, guys!
Get in here!

36:17.318 --> 36:18.694
What's going on?

36:18.778 --> 36:20.404
I know where his scrips are.

36:21.906 --> 36:23.032
Untie me.

36:26.535 --> 36:28.162
That was easy.

36:28.245 --> 36:29.997
Does he have any more apples?

36:35.086 --> 36:37.338
So you broke cover?

36:37.421 --> 36:39.756
Betraying me for money?
You're pathetic.

36:43.552 --> 36:44.971
I want him to know the truth.

36:47.473 --> 36:48.933
Say cheese, bud.

36:57.942 --> 36:59.068
Check 'em.

37:00.194 --> 37:03.614
All right, let's move. I don't wanna
be stuck in Torus territory after dark.

37:05.532 --> 37:06.700
What about lover boy?

37:06.783 --> 37:08.327
He's seen our faces.

37:08.410 --> 37:09.871
No, he won't say anything.

37:12.664 --> 37:13.707
I guess it's your lucky day, champ.

37:15.001 --> 37:18.587
Everyone search.
Take anything we can hock.

37:18.670 --> 37:21.590
And look for air mask filters.
We're running low.

37:35.646 --> 37:37.356
What about the Cuz killer?

37:37.439 --> 37:39.025
We could probably strip it for parts?

37:40.109 --> 37:41.527
Hey, genius.

37:41.610 --> 37:43.570
What's that thing do anyway,
besides fry people?

37:49.076 --> 37:53.080
That's right.
You were a military engineer at Torus.

37:53.164 --> 37:55.374
So that's why it's
like a weapon or something?

37:56.500 --> 37:57.793
We're taking it with us.

38:02.798 --> 38:04.175
What's it do?

38:04.258 --> 38:06.468
We'll find a use for it.

38:06.552 --> 38:10.764
Listen to me, Ren.
I'm sorry, but it has to be this way.

38:26.238 --> 38:28.240
She didn't tie your legs back up.

38:33.245 --> 38:35.664
Do you know you're still on Torus payroll?

38:38.709 --> 38:40.544
Torus didn't want word getting out
that you disappeared

38:40.627 --> 38:42.546
with their most valuable possession.

38:43.505 --> 38:45.174
Whatever the hell that is.

38:46.800 --> 38:48.635
What's that thing run on, anyway?

38:50.346 --> 38:51.347
Love.

38:53.015 --> 38:56.268
My grams always used to say
that love made the world go round.

38:57.186 --> 38:59.896
But then, she was sick in the head
with the kuru virus, so...

39:10.324 --> 39:11.408
Mobius Common.

39:12.701 --> 39:14.786
<i>Identify yourself.</i>

39:14.870 --> 39:16.830
Ouroboros forty-six clear niner-four.

39:16.913 --> 39:20.626
Request recon crush-down
for Operation Riverrun. Over.

39:20.709 --> 39:23.795
<i>Triangulating coordinates.
Stand by.</i>

39:25.756 --> 39:28.050
<i>ZMP fiver-Delta is in proximity.</i>

39:29.010 --> 39:30.427
<i>Drop time imminent.</i>

39:30.511 --> 39:31.845
Copy. Out.

39:34.974 --> 39:36.933
Did Torus promise your freedom
if you found me?

39:37.851 --> 39:39.728
You know they're lying, but I can help.

39:40.980 --> 39:42.731
Is that the best you got?

39:42.814 --> 39:44.733
Oh.

39:44.816 --> 39:48.029
That'll smart.
How do I disable it?

39:52.491 --> 39:53.617
I use that?

39:55.202 --> 39:56.245
What's the login?

40:00.499 --> 40:02.418
What's the login?

40:06.130 --> 40:07.173
Hannah.

40:08.424 --> 40:10.426
Hannah?
Seriously?

40:12.344 --> 40:14.138
Well, I guess that's romantic.

40:24.898 --> 40:28.360
I get paid whether I bring you back
dead or alive.

40:28.444 --> 40:29.695
What's the login?

40:37.078 --> 40:39.205
You're running out of time.

40:40.122 --> 40:41.207
Is that the best you...

40:42.916 --> 40:45.044
Hannah, wake up.

40:46.628 --> 40:47.754
Sonny shot me.

40:47.838 --> 40:50.466
- Sonny's a merc. Torus sent him.
- Torus?

40:51.425 --> 40:52.759
What do we do?

40:53.385 --> 40:55.387
Play along.

41:06.690 --> 41:08.150
Did he just say "play along"?

41:08.234 --> 41:10.319
I don't know.
I was asleep.

41:10.402 --> 41:12.946
You idiots scared the shit out of me.
You're four hours early.

41:13.029 --> 41:14.073
Cuz is dead.

41:14.698 --> 41:16.867
He got electrocuted
by some crazy machine in the garage.

41:19.286 --> 41:20.537
Grimm.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.086
- Did you fuck him?
- No.

41:28.837 --> 41:30.214
The plan, remember?

41:30.297 --> 41:32.383
- Get Renton to let his guard down.
- Yeah, but not your guard.

41:32.466 --> 41:33.592
Stop it.

41:35.719 --> 41:37.971
We fell asleep after talking all night.

41:38.889 --> 41:40.015
That's it.

41:40.932 --> 41:43.269
Then... what?

41:44.478 --> 41:46.105
Give me five minutes alone with Renton.

41:47.939 --> 41:51.235
Leave you two alone together?
Yeah, that won't look at all suspicious.

41:51.318 --> 41:54.696
Just go to the kitchen and eat.
That's believable.

41:54.780 --> 41:56.407
We're not here to eat.

41:57.616 --> 41:59.243
He has apples.

42:00.035 --> 42:01.828
Nobody has apples anymore.

42:01.912 --> 42:03.205
He does.

42:04.456 --> 42:05.832
Okay. All right.

42:11.297 --> 42:12.339
Go on.

42:31.858 --> 42:33.527
Were you brats playing doctor?

42:33.610 --> 42:34.861
Just leave us alone.

42:40.116 --> 42:41.577
Give me your scrips.

42:42.494 --> 42:43.912
You got five minutes.

42:47.123 --> 42:48.792
You're not taking the ARQ.

42:52.754 --> 42:55.591
We need to tell Grimm about Sonny.

42:57.551 --> 42:59.345
I don't trust him.

42:59.428 --> 43:01.555
I don't even trust you right now.

43:02.639 --> 43:05.684
Renton, if Sonny's a merc,
we need all the help we can get.

43:09.020 --> 43:11.732
<i>The air is too toxic to breathe.</i>

43:12.858 --> 43:16.320
<i>Our water, a poisonous ink.</i>

43:16.403 --> 43:18.739
<i>Summer is cold. Winter's hot.</i>

43:19.990 --> 43:22.909
<i>And now that the birds are extinct,</i>

43:22.993 --> 43:24.453
<i>the only species left...</i>

43:24.536 --> 43:26.121
You know, I heard this broadcast before.

43:28.039 --> 43:31.042
- Must be a repeat.
- That's because Torus have her.

43:32.794 --> 43:34.421
You got a real negative attitude,
you know that?

43:35.672 --> 43:37.924
<i>...what happened
to continental Australia</i>

43:38.008 --> 43:40.511
<i>will happen to the entire planet.</i>

43:42.388 --> 43:45.516
<i>It will be 10,000 years</i>

43:45.599 --> 43:49.978
<i>before anyone can step foot
on that radioactive rubble again.</i>

43:50.061 --> 43:51.355
What's that?

43:51.438 --> 43:52.481
Kerosene.

43:53.440 --> 43:54.608
It's ours now.

43:55.191 --> 43:57.986
<i>Torus will plunder.</i>

43:58.069 --> 44:02.616
<i>The company will consume
until there's nothing left to consume.</i>

44:03.700 --> 44:06.828
<i>Torus claims they're humanity's savior.</i>

44:06.912 --> 44:11.500
<i>Take them true for what they really are,
our executioner.</i>

44:12.501 --> 44:14.002
You cut that into four pieces?

44:15.421 --> 44:16.422
So?

44:16.505 --> 44:18.632
So there's three of us.

44:18.715 --> 44:21.343
- Yeah, well, Hannah makes four.
- Oh, don't say her name, dummy.

44:35.857 --> 44:36.900
Where'd he go?

44:40.404 --> 44:42.072
God!

44:42.155 --> 44:44.240
He escaped while you idiots
were stuffing your faces.

44:44.325 --> 44:46.618
- It was your idea.
- Yeah, well, you took too long.

44:46.702 --> 44:48.537
He's probably long gone.
The scrips, too.

44:48.620 --> 44:51.540
- Nah, he's still in the house.
- How do you know?

44:51.623 --> 44:52.749
Hunch.

44:55.043 --> 44:58.129
You two search the main floor.
Me and Grimm will take the basement. Go.

44:59.798 --> 45:02.050
- We should stick together.
- Go.

45:12.185 --> 45:14.646
- What are you doing?
- We need to kill Sonny.

45:16.147 --> 45:17.524
Sonny?

45:19.317 --> 45:20.486
Sonny?

45:55.812 --> 45:57.063
Don't look at me like that.

45:57.147 --> 45:58.857
Why would Torus care about
a few thousand scrips?

45:58.940 --> 46:02.235
No, they don't care about the money.
They care about this.

46:03.361 --> 46:04.946
What's special about this thing?

46:05.864 --> 46:07.365
It's a time machine.

48:11.865 --> 48:14.993
At 6:11, Cuz was electrocuted,

48:15.076 --> 48:18.413
which shorted the ARQ
and caused time to loop.

48:19.330 --> 48:21.542
- A time loop?
- Yes.

48:21.625 --> 48:24.002
And Torus sent Sonny to take the ARQ back.

48:26.880 --> 48:30.258
- Hannah, Sonny's a friend.
- Some friend.

48:30.926 --> 48:33.804
He's already killed you once.
Probably more.

48:49.069 --> 48:50.654
Did you find him?

48:50.737 --> 48:54.575
No... but he killed Brother.

48:54.658 --> 48:56.242
He's lying.

48:58.704 --> 49:00.205
Where'd you get that?

49:04.000 --> 49:06.419
- Where is he?
- He's gone.

49:07.337 --> 49:08.839
Aw, and he left you here all alone?

49:09.590 --> 49:12.175
No. Renton only cares about himself.

49:12.258 --> 49:13.844
And the ARQ.

49:33.446 --> 49:34.990
Is it over?

49:46.042 --> 49:47.919
Let's shut this damn thing down.

49:49.880 --> 49:52.007
Is the ARQ spinning faster?

49:52.090 --> 49:53.634
I have no idea.

50:07.856 --> 50:09.399
September 19th.

50:18.283 --> 50:20.285
That was the last time we saw each other.

50:23.413 --> 50:26.124
If I could relive one day,

50:26.207 --> 50:27.500
I'd...

50:33.423 --> 50:35.091
Grimm.

50:35.175 --> 50:36.301
Oh, my God. He's alive.

50:36.384 --> 50:39.595
Grimm. Grimm, look at me.
Look at me. You're gonna be okay.

50:39.680 --> 50:41.765
Get a first aid kit or something!

50:41.848 --> 50:42.933
Okay.

51:05.038 --> 51:06.206
Fuck!

51:09.667 --> 51:10.961
Oh, fuck!

51:14.214 --> 51:16.466
- What are you doing?
- Stand back.

51:16.549 --> 51:18.134
We don't have air masks.

52:10.896 --> 52:13.648
- Why is this loop different?
- Sonny's aware of the time loops.

52:14.565 --> 52:18.111
- Sonny's aware, how?
- I don't know. How did you become aware?

52:18.194 --> 52:20.196
- I just woke up and remembered.
- Me, too.

52:23.533 --> 52:26.494
- So is remembering just random?
- No.

52:26.577 --> 52:27.578
No, no, no, no.

52:27.662 --> 52:31.166
The ARQ emits electromagnetic frequencies
that could affect memory.

52:32.167 --> 52:35.461
We're farthest away from the ARQ
when it resets.

52:35.545 --> 52:39.090
Yeah, which is why
the effect wore off on us first.

52:40.341 --> 52:41.968
And now Sonny. Shit.

52:46.681 --> 52:48.266
Data's still the same.

52:49.434 --> 52:52.437
Loops begin and end at the same time.
Then everything resets.

52:53.729 --> 52:55.565
Why doesn't the data also reset?

52:58.860 --> 53:02.072
The time logs are housed
in the ARQ's core structure, above the...

53:03.406 --> 53:04.574
fuel cells.

53:06.868 --> 53:10.246
The loop ends at 9:25 'cause that's
when the power source runs out.

53:10.330 --> 53:12.707
When the... the fuel cells go dead?

53:13.291 --> 53:15.376
When the loop resets,
the fuel cells are still charged.

53:15.460 --> 53:19.923
The ARQ isn't producing unlimited energy.
It's just using the same energy.

53:27.889 --> 53:29.807
Okay, that's great, but what about Sonny?

53:34.645 --> 53:36.147
Shit.

53:36.231 --> 53:37.983
We stop Sonny
before he calls in the ZMPs.

53:52.413 --> 53:53.748
No sign of Sonny.

54:00.296 --> 54:02.132
We should go while we have the chance.

54:04.134 --> 54:06.344
- And take the ARQ to the Bloc.
- Oh, come on.

54:06.427 --> 54:07.803
- Just hear me out.
- No.

54:07.888 --> 54:09.639
Any battle the Bloc loses with the ARQ,

54:09.722 --> 54:12.350
they'll be able to loop back in time
and fight again...

54:13.268 --> 54:16.062
until they get it right, until we win.

54:16.146 --> 54:17.605
- You don't know that.
- Neither do you.

54:17.688 --> 54:19.815
But if Torus gets the ARQ...

54:21.234 --> 54:22.402
they'll be unstoppable.

54:22.485 --> 54:25.530
Torus can't get the ARQ,
but neither can the Bloc.

54:26.447 --> 54:28.616
You would rather keep it to yourself.

54:30.035 --> 54:32.078
You haven't changed.

54:32.162 --> 54:33.997
- Still selfish and...
- I'm selfish?

54:34.080 --> 54:37.542
All I care about is you.
All you care about is the Bloc.

54:37.625 --> 54:41.254
Ren, there is a war on.
I don't have time for us.

54:42.964 --> 54:44.549
Then what are you fighting for?

54:48.386 --> 54:51.806
The ARQ is dangerous in the wrong hands.
I don't trust the Bloc.

54:52.890 --> 54:54.267
Then trust me.

54:56.978 --> 55:00.606
Look, if Sonny gets me before I get him...

55:00.690 --> 55:02.442
He won't.

55:02.525 --> 55:05.486
You can't let him take the ARQ.
You have to destroy it.

55:07.072 --> 55:08.448
How?

55:09.032 --> 55:11.993
Enter the self-destruct prompt
into the user ID.

55:12.077 --> 55:13.954
It'll wipe the system,
melt the circuit boards,

55:14.037 --> 55:15.330
the cylinder will spin out of control.

55:15.413 --> 55:17.498
Everything will be lost.

55:19.584 --> 55:20.961
What's the prompt?

55:21.627 --> 55:24.255
- This is a last resort.
- I know.

55:25.715 --> 55:27.050
What's the prompt?

55:30.845 --> 55:33.431
Just before we were separated,
I gave you a code word.

55:35.308 --> 55:38.228
- You mean before you left me.
- Do you remember?

55:40.146 --> 55:41.689
I remember you acting paranoid.

55:41.772 --> 55:44.525
Hannah, I was trying to warn you.

55:51.782 --> 55:52.867
Sky.

58:29.232 --> 58:30.900
Hannah, open the door!

58:30.983 --> 58:32.527
Hannah!

58:54.340 --> 58:56.050
You checked the wrong pocket.

58:56.967 --> 58:59.637
- Mobius Common.
<i>- Identify yourself.</i>

58:59.720 --> 59:00.721
- You okay?
- Yeah.

59:00.805 --> 59:02.432
Ouroboros forty-six
clear niner-four.

59:02.515 --> 59:05.393
Request recon crush-down
for Operation Riverrun. Over.

59:06.311 --> 59:07.853
<i>Triangulating coordinates.</i>

59:09.355 --> 59:11.982
- You don't know what you're doing.
- Oh, you got that right.

59:12.066 --> 59:14.026
I was ordered
to recover an energy turbine.

59:14.109 --> 59:16.279
Apparently, it's a time machine.

59:16.362 --> 59:18.448
<i>ZMP fiver-Delta is in proximity.</i>

59:19.449 --> 59:20.908
<i>Drop time imminent.</i>

59:20.991 --> 59:22.327
Copy. Out.

59:23.161 --> 59:26.497
You're nothing to Torus.
An expendable pawn.

59:26.581 --> 59:28.291
Like you are to the Bloc?

59:28.374 --> 59:32.378
If Torus gets the ARQ, they'll kill
millions more than they already have.

59:32.462 --> 59:34.880
People have been killing each other
since the dawn of time.

59:34.964 --> 59:37.633
Yeah.
Because of people like you.

59:37.717 --> 59:39.469
You misunderstand me.

59:39.552 --> 59:42.263
This war kills us all.
I don't want that.

59:42.347 --> 59:45.225
So you're giving the ARQ
to the bastards who started the war.

59:46.267 --> 59:48.436
Better that someone wins
than everybody dies.

59:49.270 --> 59:50.813
What's the login?

59:55.651 --> 59:56.694
Sky.

59:59.697 --> 01:00:00.906
Sky.

01:00:07.497 --> 01:00:09.582
We've been here before.
How does it end?

01:00:11.501 --> 01:00:12.960
You shoot me in the face.

01:00:13.043 --> 01:00:16.005
- Well, I guess history does repeat.
- Okay. Okay.

01:00:16.922 --> 01:00:18.132
Just...

01:00:19.259 --> 01:00:20.426
I'll shut it down.

01:00:28.684 --> 01:00:30.853
Why didn't you destroy the ARQ?

01:00:32.855 --> 01:00:35.316
We need help.
We need to tell Grimm.

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:37.235
- We tried that. It didn't work.
- We try again.

01:00:37.318 --> 01:00:39.487
Do the same thing,
expect different results?

01:00:39.570 --> 01:00:41.155
Do you have a better idea?

01:01:24.782 --> 01:01:27.410
Hey, he wasn't moving
for a second. It was crazy.

01:01:32.332 --> 01:01:34.459
Sonny saved your life, man.

01:01:34.542 --> 01:01:37.712
You were being electrocuted, dude.
You were like...

01:01:37.795 --> 01:01:39.171
He was crazy.
He didn't hesitate.

01:01:39.254 --> 01:01:42.049
He just jumped in, kicked you off.
Now you're back.

01:01:42.132 --> 01:01:43.718
You all right?

01:01:43.801 --> 01:01:45.928
Just déjà vu.

01:02:01.235 --> 01:02:02.820
All right, change of plans?

01:02:02.903 --> 01:02:03.988
This is it.

01:02:05.072 --> 01:02:07.367
What about the target?
Is he here?

01:02:07.450 --> 01:02:10.119
We gotta disable that
before we take him down.

01:02:10.202 --> 01:02:11.286
Why?

01:02:44.362 --> 01:02:45.946
How well do you know that Cuz guy?

01:02:46.030 --> 01:02:49.742
I don't. He's Sonny's guy.
He's quiet. He didn't say much.

01:02:50.868 --> 01:02:52.537
You're sure this is safe?

01:02:53.829 --> 01:02:55.289
- Ready?
- Yeah.

01:03:18.563 --> 01:03:19.689
Almonds?

01:03:27.237 --> 01:03:28.322
Cyanide.

01:04:10.823 --> 01:04:12.450
The ARQ is speeding up.

01:04:13.701 --> 01:04:16.120
The faster it spins,
the faster time moves.

01:04:31.594 --> 01:04:33.012
Why are we doing this?

01:04:40.728 --> 01:04:41.854
Don't be mad now.

01:04:47.818 --> 01:04:50.571
They'll die before the ARQ resets.

01:04:50.655 --> 01:04:52.072
Okay? It'll work.

01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:58.996
In the last loop, before the ARQ reset...

01:05:01.666 --> 01:05:03.709
What? What happened?

01:05:05.085 --> 01:05:07.296
It's not as if something happened...

01:05:08.589 --> 01:05:11.008
it's more that everything
stopped happening.

01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:14.386
Hannah, the ARQ is dangerous.

01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:17.056
You should have destroyed it.

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:20.643
And let you die?

01:05:52.717 --> 01:05:53.968
It's safe.

01:05:58.472 --> 01:05:59.473
Cyanide did this?

01:05:59.557 --> 01:06:02.059
No. Sonny did this.

01:06:05.479 --> 01:06:07.189
Were the loops making him crazy?

01:06:07.272 --> 01:06:10.568
No. No, he probably did this
just to slow us down.

01:06:10.651 --> 01:06:12.361
Because ZMPs are coming.
We gotta move.

01:06:12.444 --> 01:06:15.489
Okay, I'll download the data
and dismantle the ARQ.

01:06:15.573 --> 01:06:16.907
And take it to the Bloc.

01:06:16.991 --> 01:06:20.035
- Hannah, not this shit!
- Ren, wha...

01:06:20.119 --> 01:06:21.704
We can end the war.

01:06:21.787 --> 01:06:24.373
What? A few rebels defeating
the largest corporation on Earth?

01:06:24.456 --> 01:06:26.083
Yes, it can happen.

01:06:26.166 --> 01:06:29.920
Torus has standing armies, okay?
Fighter drones, ZMPs, fucking nukes!

01:06:30.004 --> 01:06:31.631
And the Bloc would have the ARQ.

01:06:32.422 --> 01:06:34.675
- Forever the idealist.
- Forever the pessimist.

01:06:34.759 --> 01:06:37.052
Realist, okay? Evidence and facts,
not wishful thinking.

01:06:37.136 --> 01:06:39.429
- I call it hope.
- When did you become so naive?

01:06:39.513 --> 01:06:41.849
Oh, God damn it!
Fuck you!

01:06:45.477 --> 01:06:46.520
Oh, my God.

01:06:46.604 --> 01:06:47.647
What?

01:06:48.731 --> 01:06:49.774
Ren?

01:06:56.321 --> 01:06:57.572
Look.

01:06:57.657 --> 01:06:59.491
<i>Listen carefully. Torus... Hannah!</i>

01:07:03.162 --> 01:07:04.329
<i>Torus...</i>

01:07:05.455 --> 01:07:07.499
- I don't remember that.
- Neither do I.

01:07:08.668 --> 01:07:11.003
This was recorded
just before the loop resets.

01:07:17.259 --> 01:07:18.427
The crack.

01:07:20.137 --> 01:07:21.471
It's different.

01:07:22.848 --> 01:07:24.975
- What does it mean?
- I don't know.

01:07:27.687 --> 01:07:28.688
Oh, shit!

01:07:30.898 --> 01:07:32.357
ZMPs.

01:07:32.942 --> 01:07:34.276
- We gotta get out of here.
- Okay. Okay.

01:07:34.359 --> 01:07:36.153
- Grab scrips, supplies...
- Yep.

01:07:36.236 --> 01:07:37.738
I'll lock it down.

01:07:41.158 --> 01:07:42.743
There's something in his mouth.

01:08:23.783 --> 01:08:25.035
Our code word.

01:08:26.495 --> 01:08:28.330
- What?
- Sky.

01:08:28.412 --> 01:08:30.624
No! Hannah, don't move!

01:08:30.707 --> 01:08:32.835
No! No. Shit!

01:08:33.794 --> 01:08:37.965
No. No.
No. No. No. Fuck.

01:08:39.383 --> 01:08:40.425
Come on, Hannah.

01:08:43.929 --> 01:08:47.057
Hannah, come on, breathe.
Breathe.

01:08:48.225 --> 01:08:49.309
Hannah.

01:08:50.310 --> 01:08:52.979
Hannah, come on.
Come on.

01:10:00.089 --> 01:10:01.090
Come here.

01:10:02.007 --> 01:10:03.008
Come on.

01:10:36.625 --> 01:10:37.751
Hey.

01:10:37.835 --> 01:10:39.544
Hey. Hey.

01:10:39.628 --> 01:10:40.629
You okay?

01:10:40.712 --> 01:10:41.796
What happened?

01:10:44.091 --> 01:10:47.344
I'm sorry about what I said.
I was wrong.

01:10:51.473 --> 01:10:53.683
It's okay.

01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:57.146
Stop! Stop.

01:10:57.229 --> 01:10:58.813
What? No, don't!

01:10:59.356 --> 01:11:00.482
Where's Sonny?

01:11:01.816 --> 01:11:03.568
Where is he?

01:11:03.652 --> 01:11:05.070
There goes the plan.

01:11:05.154 --> 01:11:07.614
Sonny just stopped Cuz
from being electrocuted, didn't he?

01:11:08.615 --> 01:11:09.824
Did you tell him?

01:11:11.493 --> 01:11:12.619
No. Well...

01:11:12.702 --> 01:11:14.246
sort of.

01:11:14.329 --> 01:11:17.124
- What's that mean?
- Sonny and Cuz are mercs.

01:11:17.207 --> 01:11:18.375
Come on.

01:11:18.458 --> 01:11:22.212
Torus sent him.
They want Renton's machine.

01:11:22.296 --> 01:11:24.673
- That thing in the garage?
- Yes.

01:11:24.756 --> 01:11:26.008
What about it?

01:11:29.761 --> 01:11:31.263
It loops time.

01:11:32.181 --> 01:11:34.516
We've been reliving the same day
over and over.

01:11:34.599 --> 01:11:35.642
Oh, brother!

01:11:36.435 --> 01:11:38.603
If you don't help us, we're all gonna die.

01:11:38.687 --> 01:11:40.355
Us? Liar.

01:11:40.981 --> 01:11:43.442
No!

01:11:44.026 --> 01:11:45.277
I remember.

01:11:45.903 --> 01:11:47.321
Prove it.

01:11:47.988 --> 01:11:51.116
Grimm, what do you remember?

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:52.993
I had a déjà vu and Sonny shot me.

01:11:53.911 --> 01:11:55.870
- Then you, too.
- Right.

01:12:02.294 --> 01:12:04.588
- So this is for real?
- Yes.

01:12:06.924 --> 01:12:08.217
You gonna help us?

01:12:14.974 --> 01:12:16.266
What do we do?

01:12:17.684 --> 01:12:19.436
You all are sick with the kuru virus,
you know that?

01:12:19.519 --> 01:12:20.562
Quiet.

01:12:21.813 --> 01:12:23.983
Sonny shot you because you were aware.

01:12:24.066 --> 01:12:25.150
So?

01:12:25.234 --> 01:12:28.237
If he knew you were aware,
why would he send you to get us?

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:30.614
Sonny would expect him to betray him.

01:12:30.697 --> 01:12:31.698
What?

01:12:36.453 --> 01:12:37.662
You two really are mercs.

01:12:43.335 --> 01:12:44.669
Go on. Kneel down.

01:12:45.712 --> 01:12:47.006
Kneel down!

01:12:48.423 --> 01:12:49.674
Kneel down.

01:12:50.592 --> 01:12:52.511
Down on your...
No. No, not you.

01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:59.101
Everyone kneel but you.
You sit down.

01:13:01.979 --> 01:13:03.522
Go to hell.

01:13:13.948 --> 01:13:17.202
Now, at the risk of repeating myself,
what's the goddamn login?

01:13:21.915 --> 01:13:23.375
Don't fucking tell him.

01:13:26.378 --> 01:13:28.547
No! Don't! Don't!

01:13:31.508 --> 01:13:33.552
September 19.
September one-nine.

01:13:40.684 --> 01:13:42.644
Enough! September 19!

01:13:44.771 --> 01:13:45.772
Stop.

01:13:49.109 --> 01:13:50.235
September one-nine.

01:13:52.612 --> 01:13:54.281
Well, isn't that romantic?

01:13:58.327 --> 01:13:59.744
How do I disable it?

01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:02.372
Command F6.

01:14:14.343 --> 01:14:15.552
Now go touch it.

01:14:26.563 --> 01:14:27.856
Then I'll throw you.

01:14:36.365 --> 01:14:37.491
It's safe.

01:14:57.719 --> 01:14:59.429
Oh, will you look at that?

01:15:06.270 --> 01:15:07.687
Sonny.

01:15:08.272 --> 01:15:10.857
My brother, you don't need me.

01:15:11.608 --> 01:15:12.942
So I'll just go.

01:15:15.695 --> 01:15:16.780
He's right.

01:15:17.864 --> 01:15:19.158
We don't need him.

01:15:25.330 --> 01:15:26.373
Shit.

01:15:27.291 --> 01:15:28.750
It's still spinning.

01:15:30.001 --> 01:15:31.336
There's a manual shutdown.

01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:33.338
Then fucking disable it.

01:15:56.945 --> 01:15:58.280
Run!

01:16:20.344 --> 01:16:21.803
It's not mine.
Come on.

01:16:24.889 --> 01:16:27.058
All right. Okay, go.
Go, go, go.

01:16:38.027 --> 01:16:39.279
- Ready?
- Yeah.

01:16:53.377 --> 01:16:55.086
Here!

01:16:56.255 --> 01:16:57.381
Here.

01:17:04.638 --> 01:17:05.722
Take it.

01:17:40.549 --> 01:17:41.966
It feels petrified.

01:17:42.926 --> 01:17:44.303
What is it?

01:17:48.807 --> 01:17:50.725
I think it's a boundary.

01:17:51.518 --> 01:17:53.102
The time loop ends here.

01:17:55.939 --> 01:17:58.942
So only time inside the circle
has been looping?

01:18:24.050 --> 01:18:26.553
Hannah, there's a safe house
two blocks north.

01:18:26.636 --> 01:18:28.972
It's marked as contaminated. It's not.
I will meet you there.

01:18:29.055 --> 01:18:30.390
You're coming with me.

01:18:30.474 --> 01:18:32.309
No. I can't let Sonny take the ARQ.

01:18:32.392 --> 01:18:35.019
Renton, listen to me.
You can't go back inside.

01:18:35.103 --> 01:18:37.481
The ARQ is off.
If you die, you die forever.

01:18:37.564 --> 01:18:38.815
Go.

01:18:39.774 --> 01:18:41.067
I won't leave you.

01:18:52.912 --> 01:18:54.163
Hannah?

01:18:55.499 --> 01:18:56.666
Go, go, go!

01:19:04.966 --> 01:19:08.553
<i>♪ 'Twas in the moon of wintertime ♪</i>

01:19:09.471 --> 01:19:12.557

01:19:19.564 --> 01:19:21.315
You must recognize me.

01:19:22.609 --> 01:19:25.695
- He tortured me.
- Hey. Look at me.

01:19:25.779 --> 01:19:27.364
Listen, you're okay.

01:19:29.658 --> 01:19:32.702
<i>♪ Jesus your King is born ♪</i>

01:19:33.495 --> 01:19:36.080

01:19:40.001 --> 01:19:41.920
Tell me you haven't forgotten.

01:20:29.718 --> 01:20:32.554
You're okay. You're okay.

01:20:32.637 --> 01:20:33.722
Okay.

01:20:37.601 --> 01:20:40.353
It's over. Okay? It's over.

01:20:41.980 --> 01:20:43.898
It's over. It's over.

01:20:49.779 --> 01:20:51.906
Sonny turned the ARQ back on.

01:20:51.990 --> 01:20:53.825
He must want the loop to reset.

01:20:53.908 --> 01:20:55.869
It's okay.
Come on.

01:20:55.952 --> 01:20:57.245
Come on.

01:21:49.130 --> 01:21:52.216
<i>ZMP fiver-Delta is in proximity.</i>

01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:53.635
<i>Drop time imminent.</i>

01:21:54.427 --> 01:21:56.137
Sonny called in ZMPs.

01:21:57.514 --> 01:21:58.932
Okay.

01:21:59.015 --> 01:22:02.268
We download everything.
Burn it all.

01:22:03.562 --> 01:22:04.938
There isn't time.

01:22:05.021 --> 01:22:06.773
Take the ARQ to the Bloc.

01:22:08.232 --> 01:22:09.568
Really?

01:22:11.528 --> 01:22:13.905
If there's no world left,
there's no hope for us.

01:22:20.453 --> 01:22:21.580
What?

01:22:23.873 --> 01:22:25.499
- What?
- Oh, my God.

01:22:28.670 --> 01:22:30.004
"Interruption."

01:22:31.548 --> 01:22:33.883
These time logs are the nine loops
we've gone through.

01:22:33.967 --> 01:22:36.803
Nine loops makes one sequence. There's...

01:22:38.429 --> 01:22:39.806
There's more sequences.

01:22:40.724 --> 01:22:43.768
So we've looped more than nine times?
How many?

01:22:45.144 --> 01:22:47.438
Ren, how many times have we loop...

01:22:54.028 --> 01:22:56.197
Thousands.
Maybe... maybe more.

01:22:58.908 --> 01:23:01.327
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:23:01.410 --> 01:23:03.830
No, no, no, no, this can't be happening.

01:23:06.499 --> 01:23:08.668
The last timeline
in every sequence is broken.

01:23:08.752 --> 01:23:10.962
It's... it's when I shut down the ARQ
and Sonny rebooted it.

01:23:13.214 --> 01:23:15.091
When the ARQ reboots,
our memories must reset.

01:23:15.174 --> 01:23:17.176
That's why we don't remember the video.

01:23:17.260 --> 01:23:19.178
The video was recorded
in the last sequence.

01:23:19.262 --> 01:23:20.764
It was a message to us.

01:23:21.681 --> 01:23:23.349
And a ZMP stopped the message.

01:23:24.809 --> 01:23:26.019
They're in the house.

01:23:34.944 --> 01:23:36.070
Damn it!

01:23:37.071 --> 01:23:38.615
If Torus gets the ARQ...

01:23:40.283 --> 01:23:41.409
they win the war.

01:23:43.161 --> 01:23:44.788
We have to destroy it.

01:23:48.041 --> 01:23:49.208
God damn it!

01:24:05.767 --> 01:24:06.851
No.

01:24:09.771 --> 01:24:11.773
- What are you doing?
- We let the loop reset.

01:24:11.856 --> 01:24:13.733
We try again.

01:24:13.817 --> 01:24:15.484
We've tried already, thousands of times.

01:24:15.568 --> 01:24:17.862
We send a message to ourselves
in the next loop.

01:24:18.738 --> 01:24:22.075
Hannah, you were right.
We have to try.

01:24:25.453 --> 01:24:26.620
Hurry.

01:24:33.962 --> 01:24:36.923
Listen carefully. Torus...
Hannah!

01:24:37.006 --> 01:24:38.717
The message!

01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:39.801
Torus found you.

01:24:39.884 --> 01:24:42.095
Take the ARQ to the Bloc and trust Hannah!

01:24:57.092 --> 01:25:02.092
