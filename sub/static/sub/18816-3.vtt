He bought some land
and he bought a wife.

00:04.000 --> 00:05.525
Nootka was my mother's tribe.

00:05.575 --> 00:09.200
This small piece of land will be
incredibly valuable to the Americans.

00:09.250 --> 00:11.925
Sell this land for a reasonable price.

00:11.975 --> 00:13.875
Nootka Sound is not for sale.

00:13.925 --> 00:16.475
I have something of
great value to your nation,

00:16.525 --> 00:19.050
something the British
are trying to kill me for.

00:19.100 --> 00:21.750
<i>Someone has been brought
to London to try and kill me,</i>

00:21.800 --> 00:24.200
and I will need your eyes
and ears from now on.

00:24.250 --> 00:26.250
<i>You used to straighten your skirts</i>

00:26.300 --> 00:29.350
and march away like nothing
had ever happened.

00:29.400 --> 00:31.850
And what exactly is it
that my father owed you?

00:31.900 --> 00:34.800
All that is due from
a husband to a wife.

00:34.850 --> 00:37.450
This widow will
have sole claim on Nootka

00:37.500 --> 00:39.525
<i>in the event of Delaney's death--</i>

00:39.575 --> 00:41.775
an event which may be imminent.

Over there, a body.

02:09.574 --> 02:11.450
Try her pockets.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.000
It's a man.

02:16.300 --> 02:18.475
The fishes ate his heart out.

02:18.525 --> 02:20.975
Maybe the fishes, maybe not.

02:22.700 --> 02:24.500
The silver tooth is mine.

02:26.250 --> 02:28.450
Who has a blade for the dentistry?

02:45.725 --> 02:47.500
[thrust of a blade]

02:50.800 --> 02:52.975
Relax, Mr. Delaney.

02:54.575 --> 02:57.925
You're in safe hands.
Your devil saved you.

03:03.700 --> 03:05.650
I had you followed.

03:05.700 --> 03:09.000
My agent said that he saw
some unspeakable acts.

03:09.050 --> 03:11.050
[thrust of a blade]

03:12.100 --> 03:14.050
I had to give him the day off.

03:15.525 --> 03:17.575
Your man's in the river.

03:18.600 --> 03:20.650
The British want you dead.

03:21.775 --> 03:24.450
We want you alive though.
That's something, huh?

03:28.800 --> 03:30.775
You take pain like a stone.

03:31.850 --> 03:34.500
Is that something you picked
up in Africa, maybe?

03:35.600 --> 03:37.775
How many more are left?

03:44.800 --> 03:46.800
I gave your name to our friend.

03:46.850 --> 03:50.525
He said something about a piece
of land up there in the Pacific.

03:51.575 --> 03:55.250
He said that you've been swaggering
all around town with it in your hat

03:55.300 --> 03:57.000
like a peacock feather.

04:01.575 --> 04:04.250
Well, you don't
appear to be swaggering now.

04:05.300 --> 04:08.250
I need to speak to Carlsbad himself.

04:09.325 --> 04:12.800
I need him to take a message
to Thomas Jefferson

04:12.850 --> 04:15.375
and the President of the United States.

04:16.300 --> 04:19.600
In Ponta Delgada, Colonnade told me

04:19.649 --> 04:23.800
that he would find me an emissary
to Thomas Jefferson.

04:23.850 --> 04:27.050
So just tell me what
you want to say to Carlsbad,

04:27.100 --> 04:30.000
and I'll stitch you
up and set you loose.

04:33.400 --> 04:34.775
No?

04:39.775 --> 04:42.500
Interesting knife
they used to carve you up.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.750
Is that Chinese, you think?

04:46.800 --> 04:48.300
Or Malay?

04:59.850 --> 05:05.300
When you came in here with bits of
a man's flesh between your teeth...

05:06.200 --> 05:08.175
we kind of had a silent deal.

05:09.300 --> 05:12.325
I stitch you up and you
give me information.

05:13.450 --> 05:16.175
Tell me what you want
in return for Nootka.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.550
What's your price?

05:19.600 --> 05:22.175
I don't have a price.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.375
So what do you want?

05:34.500 --> 05:35.725
Tea.

05:37.600 --> 05:41.500
- Tea?
- You tell Carlsbad that I want tea.

05:44.775 --> 05:46.400
Carlsbad said, "You know,

05:46.450 --> 05:49.000
Delaney might just be crazy
enough to take us all on--

05:49.050 --> 05:51.375
the King, the Company
and the free fifteen."

05:52.400 --> 05:53.650
Huh?

05:53.700 --> 05:55.325
Maybe she was right.

05:56.775 --> 05:59.350
Well, you tell Carlsbad...

05:59.400 --> 06:01.400
from me...

06:01.450 --> 06:05.250
that I will cede sovereignty of
Nootka Sound to whichever nation

06:05.300 --> 06:07.600
offers me their monopoly...

06:08.525 --> 06:11.525
on the trade of furs for tea

06:11.575 --> 06:14.725
from Fort George to Canton.

06:16.525 --> 06:18.125
A monopoly.

06:19.050 --> 06:20.775
That's what I want.

06:21.775 --> 06:23.725
All the tea in China.

06:28.525 --> 06:30.975
You should have
said that from the start.

06:32.700 --> 06:35.200
Could have saved yourself
a lot of pain.

06:46.250 --> 06:48.000
And you just said...

06:49.175 --> 06:50.725
"she"...

06:50.775 --> 06:54.000
didn't you, when you said Carlsbad?

06:57.300 --> 07:00.000
So now I know I'm looking for a lady.

07:09.300 --> 07:12.125
Big berry, popping balls.
[mimics gunfire]

07:12.175 --> 07:15.750
And spitting fire, what, and
she will glide over Lake Ontario

07:15.800 --> 07:18.325
and blow kisses across
the temporary border

07:18.375 --> 07:21.200
until they learn to toast
the King once more.

07:21.250 --> 07:23.525
- Your highness.
- Ah, Coop.

07:23.575 --> 07:27.200
Your highness, I have people
within the East India Company.

07:27.250 --> 07:29.250
Oh, no, no, no.

07:29.300 --> 07:32.875
I'm in too fine a mood
to discuss the East India.

07:32.925 --> 07:35.250
James Delaney, a private individual,

07:35.300 --> 07:37.950
has recently inherited
a piece of land--

07:38.000 --> 07:40.250
Nootka Sound.

07:40.300 --> 07:44.000
Now, this piece of land
naturally affords the possibility

07:44.050 --> 07:47.725
of a direct trade route with China.

07:50.800 --> 07:52.800
If you care to look more closely,

07:52.850 --> 07:55.650
you will see that the piece
of land in question

07:55.700 --> 07:59.050
lies along the line of our disputed
border with the Americans.

07:59.100 --> 08:02.050
Oh... No, no, no,
God's work. Good fortune.

08:02.100 --> 08:06.475
If the land lies on the border,
it is an issue for the Crown.

08:06.525 --> 08:08.750
An issue of war.

08:08.800 --> 08:13.250
- And who is this man? Is he loyal?
- Erm, well, we think not.

08:14.450 --> 08:16.125
A republican?

08:16.175 --> 08:19.400
An adventurer of very poor repute.

08:19.450 --> 08:22.525
Stories of madness, savagery,

08:22.575 --> 08:25.100
theft and worse.

08:26.525 --> 08:28.475
Then, Mr. Coop...

08:28.525 --> 08:33.174
he is a man that you will be
able to do business with.

08:41.799 --> 08:43.700
You slept in a bird's nest.

08:48.250 --> 08:50.250
We need a carpenter.

08:50.300 --> 08:52.750
Yeah, the door gets stiff in winter.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.500
Shave it and it'll
be loose in the summer.

08:58.125 --> 09:00.525
- Oh...
- Dear God.

09:00.575 --> 09:03.250
We have business at
the river, you and I,

09:03.300 --> 09:06.350
but first I need to put
a fresh dressing on this.

09:06.400 --> 09:09.750
- Give me brandy and bandages.
- Who did this?

09:09.800 --> 09:13.775
A Malay with a knife and then
an American with his needles.

09:14.800 --> 09:17.375
Brandy and bandages, man.

09:36.125 --> 09:37.600
[he groans]

09:54.525 --> 09:57.250
- They'll try again.
- Who, for God's sake?

09:57.300 --> 09:59.650
So, when the carpenter comes,

09:59.700 --> 10:01.750
tell him I want all
the windows boarded up

10:01.800 --> 10:05.200
and that river hatch,
I want that closed too.

10:05.250 --> 10:07.675
So... we are besieged.

10:07.725 --> 10:10.700
I suppose I can use the same carpenter

10:10.750 --> 10:13.100
to board up the windows
that your father used

10:13.150 --> 10:14.250
when he was under siege

10:14.300 --> 10:17.250
and he can put the same old
nails in the same old holes.

10:18.325 --> 10:22.000
You can sit there with the same
old gun cocked on your lap.

10:22.050 --> 10:25.750
And when you sit there with that
same look of defiance on your face,

10:25.800 --> 10:28.200
I will ask you the
same old question--

10:28.250 --> 10:30.850
for what do you risk your life?

10:36.525 --> 10:40.050
Can you loosen up these bindings
so that I may move?

10:40.100 --> 10:42.075
Get up. Come on.

10:42.125 --> 10:43.725
Up. Up!

10:52.400 --> 10:54.350
Bill, what are you doing?

10:54.400 --> 10:56.525
- Here, take this.
- Yes, boss.

11:07.775 --> 11:11.250
No reason we can't laugh at each
other just cos we're now partners.

11:11.300 --> 11:13.575
I didn't say that you were my partner.

11:15.700 --> 11:17.125
The word along the Wapping Wall

11:17.175 --> 11:19.875
is you cut up an assassin
and ate his giblets.

11:19.925 --> 11:22.100
Did you bring me my guns?

11:25.700 --> 11:27.525
Don't trust the snake.

11:28.525 --> 11:30.400
10-bore Richardson Man Stoppers.

11:30.450 --> 11:34.325
Same power as a musket but you
can hold one in each hand.

11:34.375 --> 11:36.900
Good. Better, better.

11:40.725 --> 11:44.050
- All right.
- So if we ain't partners, what are we?

11:44.100 --> 11:47.700
Well, I'm a merchant,
you're my victualler.

11:50.725 --> 11:54.000
You can also be my ferryman.
I can't use the roads...

11:54.050 --> 11:55.775
not for now at least.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.875
You see the heathen?

11:58.925 --> 12:00.925
He's my brother-in-law.

12:00.975 --> 12:04.000
He says the best bit of
a man to eat is this.

12:04.050 --> 12:05.525
It's tender.

12:05.575 --> 12:07.525
Did you bring me salt beef?

12:07.575 --> 12:09.250
- Pork.
- No.

12:09.300 --> 12:10.600
Fresh from a sloop from somewhere cold.

12:10.650 --> 12:12.575
- Short notice.
- We don't eat pig!

12:12.625 --> 12:13.475
All right, all right.

12:13.525 --> 12:16.400
The stuff he's brought
has been on the dock for ages.

12:16.450 --> 12:19.375
Yes, probably, but I trust him,
so please pay him. Thank you.

12:23.100 --> 12:25.050
Who are you?

12:25.100 --> 12:26.725
French Bill.

12:28.525 --> 12:29.700
Argh!

12:31.700 --> 12:33.750
- You all right?
- No.

12:33.800 --> 12:36.475
Look, may I suggest Tilbury
while you heal?

12:36.525 --> 12:38.400
No, I'm not leaving London.

12:38.450 --> 12:41.200
- Atticus, talk sense to him.
- No, I'm not leaving London.

12:41.250 --> 12:43.525
- Go home. What's that?
- A boat.

12:43.575 --> 12:46.200
- I know it's a boat. Does it float?
- Yeah, yeah, of course.

12:46.250 --> 12:48.775
- How many will it take?
- Us. Where are we going?

12:48.825 --> 12:49.900
Lincoln's Inn.

12:49.950 --> 12:51.500
Lincoln's Inn. What the hell for?

12:55.300 --> 12:59.750
There is a hand-written note
on my desk in the attic.

12:59.800 --> 13:03.275
I need you to deliver it to the
secretary of His Majesty the King.

13:03.325 --> 13:05.000
Hand deliver it.

13:05.050 --> 13:06.650
Today, Brace!

13:13.800 --> 13:16.750
- There's a Mr. James Delaney, Sir.
- Oh, God.

13:16.800 --> 13:20.000
He's with some men with guns
and apparently a cannibal, Sir.

13:20.050 --> 13:21.600
Tell him I'm dead.

13:21.650 --> 13:24.400
He says he wants to make a will.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.675
[knock on door]

14:03.725 --> 14:04.900
Fuck off.

14:05.975 --> 14:07.725
Sir, I have news.

14:07.775 --> 14:10.850
I said, "Fuck off!"

14:11.925 --> 14:14.500
News of James Delaney, Sir.

14:15.525 --> 14:16.600
Come.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.250
Oh, my God!

14:23.300 --> 14:26.400
The whipped hounds
with their apologies.

14:28.050 --> 14:31.725
The assassin we
sent to kill Delaney is...

14:31.775 --> 14:33.600
dead.

14:33.650 --> 14:36.000
Delaney lives, Sir.

14:36.050 --> 14:39.925
That's not news, Mr. Pettifer. I
was aware of that by first light.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.725
This, however, is news.

14:45.800 --> 14:48.600
Delivered by hand from
Thoyt an hour ago.

14:48.650 --> 14:50.600
Read it.

14:55.800 --> 14:59.200
"This is the last will and
testament of me, James...

15:02.800 --> 15:06.200
"In the event of my death, all of
my possessions and landholdings

15:06.250 --> 15:08.000
will be bequeathed..."

15:08.050 --> 15:10.800
In severalty and in perpetuity

15:10.850 --> 15:14.725
to the sovereign nation of the
United States of America.

15:16.375 --> 15:21.100
So, now we know, the savage
boy is cunning too.

15:24.325 --> 15:28.200
And when peace comes
and this border is drawn,

15:28.250 --> 15:30.475
it will not be by soldiers

15:30.525 --> 15:32.925
but by more fucking lawyers...

15:33.900 --> 15:36.750
hundreds of them, from both sides.

15:36.800 --> 15:39.600
And every scratch and claim staked

15:39.650 --> 15:42.350
will be cited as legal precedent.

15:42.400 --> 15:47.350
And not only can we not resolve
this disaster by killing Delaney,

15:47.400 --> 15:51.650
it is now in our urgent interest
to keep the bastard alive.

15:57.700 --> 15:59.875
Get four nails and a wooden board

15:59.925 --> 16:03.750
and a man called Solomon Coop
into this room by tomorrow at noon.

16:03.800 --> 16:05.775
Can you manage that?

16:12.050 --> 16:14.500
By midday, Mr. Pettifer.

16:20.775 --> 16:22.850
[loud banging]

16:29.125 --> 16:32.750
I do what I can with the rotten
dock trash Atticus brings,

16:32.800 --> 16:36.450
so the least you can do
is sit before you refuse it.

16:37.800 --> 16:41.000
And if that sickly youth on the
doorstep is there to protect you

16:41.050 --> 16:42.875
from East India assassins,

16:42.925 --> 16:46.200
know that by 2:00 AM he's easily
distracted by whores.

16:47.300 --> 16:50.750
Well, you needn't worry about
the East India Company.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.975
No need to worry about the Crown...

16:54.000 --> 16:56.050
any longer.

16:56.100 --> 16:58.525
For now I'm only in danger
from the Americans

16:58.575 --> 17:01.950
but I reasoned that they are the
lesser of the three adversaries,

17:02.000 --> 17:03.775
wouldn't you agree?

17:12.800 --> 17:15.750
I've been searching every
fucking room in this house

17:15.800 --> 17:19.375
but not the cellar,
so I must beat the tide.

17:20.400 --> 17:22.650
I must beat the tide.

18:24.250 --> 18:25.975
Hello?

18:29.300 --> 18:31.250
Winter, what are you doing here?

18:32.800 --> 18:35.500
This is where I
come to sleep sometimes.

18:38.525 --> 18:40.250
You sleep here?

18:42.300 --> 18:43.775
I saw you.

18:44.800 --> 18:46.975
I saw you do for the Malay.

18:48.175 --> 18:50.525
And like a wolf you tore out his heart,

18:50.575 --> 18:52.750
and then threw him into the river.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.275
Splash.

18:54.325 --> 18:56.250
And down he floats...

18:56.300 --> 18:58.775
directly into Winter's arms.

19:03.250 --> 19:05.200
So I cut out your spoils.

19:05.250 --> 19:06.850
Take it.

19:06.900 --> 19:08.450
It's for you.

19:16.600 --> 19:18.450
Teach me about magic.

19:19.575 --> 19:21.875
I want to be a wolf, too,

19:21.925 --> 19:23.775
or a bird so I can fly.

19:24.775 --> 19:26.500
The bird on your neck...

19:27.575 --> 19:29.250
I know what
it is--

19:29.300 --> 19:30.775
the Sankofa.

19:36.925 --> 19:39.375
Now, you go home to Helga...

19:40.400 --> 19:42.775
because you are not safe here.

19:56.250 --> 19:57.850
[bird squawks]

22:17.525 --> 22:20.250
Your eggs and coffee
are getting cold, Sir.

22:29.800 --> 22:32.525
When was my mother last in this room?

22:36.525 --> 22:38.250
When she was sick.

22:38.300 --> 22:39.775
Sick?

22:44.775 --> 22:46.575
For the purpose of restraint?

22:47.600 --> 22:49.325
No.

22:49.375 --> 22:51.075
For her own protection.

22:51.125 --> 22:53.125
What's that?

22:57.800 --> 22:59.450
That mark.

23:00.525 --> 23:02.250
Did she make it?

23:02.300 --> 23:04.000
What mark?

23:15.925 --> 23:18.375
In the later days she did things...

23:19.250 --> 23:20.775
no-one understood.

23:21.775 --> 23:23.650
In the later days,

23:23.700 --> 23:26.325
when she wasn't allowed
to walk the streets,

23:26.375 --> 23:29.075
nor show her face in public,

23:29.125 --> 23:30.975
nor speak in English,

23:31.025 --> 23:34.900
nor her savage tongue
because she was a mad woman.

23:34.950 --> 23:37.100
- James.
- No.

23:38.525 --> 23:40.000
Explain this.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.725
I have the very same mark on me...

23:44.800 --> 23:47.725
from when I was
taken prisoner in Africa.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.525
What is it?

24:00.325 --> 24:02.100
You tell me.

24:04.800 --> 24:08.200
You don't speak but
you do have answers.

24:09.525 --> 24:11.000
You do.

24:12.525 --> 24:14.525
And you will give me answers.

24:25.800 --> 24:27.350
[screaming]

24:27.400 --> 24:29.100
[laughter]

24:31.125 --> 24:32.725
It's unconsecrated ground.

24:32.775 --> 24:34.550
It's for heathens, pagans...

24:34.600 --> 24:36.775
and those damned by suicide.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.750
They're clearing Bedlam out now.

24:39.800 --> 24:42.200
Won't be anyone left here before long.

25:10.800 --> 25:12.650
Mr. Solomon Coop, Sir,

25:12.700 --> 25:15.475
private secretary to
His Majesty King George.

25:15.525 --> 25:17.250
Thank you, Godfrey.

25:25.525 --> 25:28.250
Unless we find common cause.

25:29.700 --> 25:32.525
Well, none of the
King's causes are "common"

25:32.575 --> 25:35.600
and at the moment one only
has to say "the Company"

25:35.650 --> 25:39.600
with a certain degree of disgust
to get his undivided attention.

25:39.650 --> 25:40.925
Forget India.

25:40.975 --> 25:43.050
Tell him to put India to one side.

25:43.100 --> 25:45.150
The King will not move on India.

25:45.200 --> 25:48.125
The Regent does what you
and your coven say.

25:48.175 --> 25:50.650
You seriously underestimate him.

25:51.700 --> 25:53.850
I underestimated Delaney.

25:54.925 --> 25:56.475
Look at this.

25:56.525 --> 25:58.650
He's written a will.

26:00.975 --> 26:04.300
- You knew?
- You have 104 spies in London...

26:05.325 --> 26:08.475
and we have 202.

26:08.525 --> 26:11.725
So who the hell do you have
in Thoyt's chambers?

26:11.775 --> 26:13.475
They're all mine.

26:13.525 --> 26:15.500
Don't spoil the bloody game, Stuart.

26:16.525 --> 26:19.475
I just know everything.
Always assume I just know.

26:19.525 --> 26:22.800
Then you know we have a problem

26:22.850 --> 26:27.000
that cannot be solved
with a musket or a knife.

26:27.050 --> 26:29.600
You have a problem,
the King really does not.

26:31.325 --> 26:34.725
I received a letter
from Delaney this morning.

26:36.050 --> 26:39.325
I suppose you would
call it a pincer movement.

26:39.375 --> 26:42.000
He says he's happy for
the Nootka trading post,

26:42.050 --> 26:43.700
the smoke house and the tanning factory

26:43.750 --> 26:47.250
to be incorporated into the
territory of the British Crown,

26:47.300 --> 26:49.950
but only if we give him
a monopoly on the trade

26:50.000 --> 26:52.450
in smoked sea otter pelts from...

26:52.500 --> 26:54.925
Vancouver coast to Canton.

26:54.975 --> 26:57.200
Canton?

26:57.250 --> 27:00.800
Curiously, the word "tea"
does not appear in the letter.

27:00.850 --> 27:03.800
So you'll write back to him
and tell him to go to hell.

27:03.850 --> 27:06.050
Well, perhaps,
before I write to Delaney,

27:06.100 --> 27:07.650
we should speak about India.

27:10.050 --> 27:13.675
You'll allow this savage to determine
our American policy?

27:13.725 --> 27:16.000
Our American policy
is simple--

27:16.050 --> 27:18.550
restitution of all lands
taken by force.

27:18.600 --> 27:20.250
West of Michigan,

27:20.300 --> 27:23.250
the line of the border
will be determined by lawyers,

27:23.300 --> 27:27.450
which means almost certainly
that Delaney can give us Vancouver.

27:28.500 --> 27:32.250
And, in return, you would
sell out the East India?

27:32.300 --> 27:36.200
Settle your dispute with the King
regarding Bombay and we can talk.

27:36.250 --> 27:39.200
It all seems rather neat
and terribly simple to me.

27:39.250 --> 27:43.650
You do realise this whole
business is about revenge.

27:45.300 --> 27:48.300
And why would James Delaney
hate the India so?

27:50.975 --> 27:53.775
What the hell did you
do to him, Stuart?

27:55.400 --> 27:57.300
Always assume I just know.

27:59.525 --> 28:01.100
Then know this.

28:05.500 --> 28:09.725
Delaney will as easily sell
Nootka to the Americans

28:09.775 --> 28:12.500
if they offer him the same monopoly.

28:14.575 --> 28:17.425
Now, there, the King and the Company

28:17.475 --> 28:20.200
may be able to find our common cause.

28:21.525 --> 28:23.975
My spies tell me there is a widow.

28:28.125 --> 28:31.750
My Lady, I am so sore to have
to bring you this news.

28:31.800 --> 28:37.000
The death of my father was not
the work of fate but of one man!

28:38.575 --> 28:41.725
The cursed dwarf Frenchman
with a bullet head!

28:41.775 --> 28:43.475
Napoleon!

28:43.525 --> 28:45.875
[crowd boo]

28:45.925 --> 28:49.525
...that shames the hearts
of a weary nation.

28:49.575 --> 28:52.000
Their heads cut away...
Fuck the French!

28:52.050 --> 28:53.525
<i>Fuck Napoleon!</i>

28:53.575 --> 28:56.000
like carcasses into the Seine.

28:57.300 --> 28:59.525
<i>And out in the streets...</i>

28:59.575 --> 29:04.950
there are still those that say
that only a beast can tame a beast.

29:05.000 --> 29:10.750
And that to avenge the death of the
good people, like my dear father,

29:10.800 --> 29:15.200
we must find our own monster
and call him Napoleon!

29:15.250 --> 29:16.750

29:28.050 --> 29:30.375

somehow killed by Napoleon.

29:44.525 --> 29:47.050
- What of her?
- Her name is Lorna Bow.

29:47.100 --> 29:50.750
Yes, well, I'm afraid Miss
Bow is unavailable.

29:50.800 --> 29:52.475
Always or tonight?

29:52.525 --> 29:56.250
Always, Sir, on account of her
being a fussy, stuck up bitch, Sir.

29:58.325 --> 30:00.925
I am here on behalf of
His Majesty the King.

31:22.800 --> 31:25.250
You haven't changed a bit, Godders.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.500
Ah, I need to speak to you.

31:28.525 --> 31:32.725
Your secret won't remain a secret for
very long in the East India Company.

31:33.800 --> 31:35.800
- Blackmail?
- Yes.

31:35.850 --> 31:39.775
But between friends,
so where's the harm?

31:46.800 --> 31:50.250
Now, you take the minutes,
don't you, of every meeting

31:50.300 --> 31:54.000
and you also hear everything
they say when they raise their hand?

31:56.525 --> 31:58.450
I want that information.

32:00.300 --> 32:02.475
I will pay you for it.

32:02.525 --> 32:04.975
I'll pay you a pound every month.

32:07.525 --> 32:09.800
How did you know about me?

32:09.850 --> 32:13.750
Because I have eyes and ears
everywhere throughout the city

32:13.800 --> 32:16.725
in many places, much like
the Company itself.

32:21.800 --> 32:25.250
I honestly mean you no harm, Godders.

32:25.300 --> 32:27.750
- If I were caught...
- What?

32:27.800 --> 32:31.525
If I were caught passing
company secrets to a Delaney...

32:31.575 --> 32:35.450
You're not going to get caught
because I will protect you.

32:38.850 --> 32:41.725
You know, at the seminary,
I was in love with you.

32:44.050 --> 32:45.800
Of course you do.

32:46.800 --> 32:48.200
Of course.

32:49.925 --> 32:53.200
And there was I thinking that
we were just brothers in arms.

32:56.300 --> 32:59.000
Didn't we share a bed sometimes
in the great hall?

33:00.000 --> 33:01.775
It was torture.

33:02.800 --> 33:04.500
Exquisite.

33:05.525 --> 33:07.000
Mm.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.975
So you can trust me...

33:11.050 --> 33:13.200
and I will protect you.

33:26.525 --> 33:28.750
Your work starts now.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.250
Oh, God.

33:30.300 --> 33:33.525
How fair is the split between
the East India and the King?

33:33.575 --> 33:35.750
I'm a little drunk for business.

33:35.800 --> 33:38.775
Have they found common cause
or are they still divided?

33:41.000 --> 33:43.250
Talk to me, for fuck sake.

33:48.300 --> 33:50.250
<i>Dear, Sister...</i>

33:50.300 --> 33:53.000
<i>I am restoring our father's offices</i>

33:53.050 --> 33:55.475
<i>I have registered the
Delaney Trading Company</i>

33:55.525 --> 33:58.450
<i>with Lloyds of London
and I will ready my ship</i>

33:58.500 --> 34:03.250
<i>so that when the time is right
and the Company has fallen</i>

34:03.300 --> 34:05.600
<i>we can leave.</i>

34:05.650 --> 34:08.475
<i>I am accruing a band of loyal servants,</i>

34:08.525 --> 34:10.525
<i>none of whom have any value to me</i>

34:10.574 --> 34:13.725
<i>beyond the facilitation
of this greater good.</i>

34:13.775 --> 34:16.750
<i>When I left England, I was just a boy.</i>

34:16.800 --> 34:19.550
<i>Now I am back, much has changed.</i>

34:19.600 --> 34:23.750
<i>Your leaving England was the click
of the hypnotist's fingers.</i>

34:23.800 --> 34:27.750
<i>I woke from a trance and realised
the depth of our sin.</i>

34:27.800 --> 34:31.000
<i>I have found forgiveness
in God and in my husband,</i>

34:31.050 --> 34:35.350
<i>and I want no part in your
plans or your future.</i>

34:35.400 --> 34:37.199
<i>But we are the future.</i>

34:38.250 --> 34:40.250
<i>Your husband is already passed</i>

34:40.300 --> 34:43.250
<i>and you can see that by the
way that he follows you.</i>

34:44.775 --> 34:47.250
<i>You should let him go, poor soul.</i>

34:47.300 --> 34:48.975
<i>You torture him.</i>

34:51.400 --> 34:54.250
<i>There is enough treachery
already surrounding us</i>

34:54.300 --> 34:56.750
<i>that there is no
need for us to add to it.</i>

34:56.800 --> 35:00.250
<i>The arrival of letters at this
address does not go unnoticed.</i>

35:01.300 --> 35:05.475
<i>My husband is harsh and is
a Christian. I welcome it.</i>

35:05.525 --> 35:07.250
<i>I deserve it.</i>

35:08.250 --> 35:10.800
<i>Your husband is also a fool.</i>

35:10.850 --> 35:13.450
<i>He cannot see all that you are.</i>

35:14.525 --> 35:17.900
<i>I have sailed to places
where there is no damnation.</i>

35:18.975 --> 35:22.750
<i>We used to talk to each other
without words in dark corners.</i>

35:22.800 --> 35:26.250
<i>Your curiosity and hunger for
all that is possible out there</i>

35:26.300 --> 35:29.475
<i>could never be tethered
by base religious morality,</i>

35:29.525 --> 35:32.600
<i>ship insurance and new china.</i>

35:33.700 --> 35:37.000
<i>Please understand that from this
moment I will burn your letters</i>

35:37.050 --> 35:38.750
<i>without opening them.</i>

35:38.800 --> 35:42.600
<i>Then I will visit you
in your dreams, my love.</i>

35:42.650 --> 35:45.200
<i>Please. I'm your sister.</i>

35:45.250 --> 35:47.450
<i>Let all else lie.</i>

36:00.050 --> 36:02.750
There is a woman here to
see you and I swear the only way

36:02.800 --> 36:06.000
I could have stopped her would have
been to use the pistol you gave me

36:06.050 --> 36:09.000
and don't think I would be loathe
to use it because she's mad

36:09.050 --> 36:11.750
- and she claims she is my mistress.
- Your mistress?

36:11.800 --> 36:13.775
She says she owns this house.

36:14.775 --> 36:16.000
Right.

36:22.800 --> 36:26.725
I have engaged the services
of the best lawyer in London.

36:31.525 --> 36:33.200
Is that your lawyer?

36:34.400 --> 36:37.750
My lawyer assures me that,
as Horace Delaney's widow,

36:37.800 --> 36:42.725
by natural law of the land,
this house is therefore half mine.

36:45.250 --> 36:47.775
- It's a copy.
- It's now kindling.

36:48.975 --> 36:52.000
My servant wants to shoot
you in the face.

36:52.050 --> 36:54.300
Your servant is also now half mine.

36:56.375 --> 37:01.600
So did I just burn advice
or did I burn speculation?

37:01.650 --> 37:04.000
You actually burnt a letter of intent.

37:04.050 --> 37:07.000
Oh! And what do you intend to do...

37:07.050 --> 37:08.800
with my house?

37:09.850 --> 37:12.475
Firstly to change those awful boards.

37:12.525 --> 37:14.250
- Miss Bow...
- Mrs. Delaney!

37:14.300 --> 37:17.950
Miss Bow, do you know why there are
boards on the windows of this house?

37:18.000 --> 37:19.750
So the fortunate people outside

37:19.800 --> 37:22.750
can't see inside of the state
of this place, I imagine.

37:22.800 --> 37:26.400
No, because there are wicked men
out there who would wish me dead.

37:27.800 --> 37:31.200
However, neither the East India
or the King will kill you

37:31.250 --> 37:32.950
because of your will.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.600
The only people who would benefit
from your death are the Americans,

37:36.650 --> 37:39.475
but you're already in negotiations
with the Americans,

37:39.525 --> 37:42.950
so surely once the boards
have gone we could put curtains up.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.500
You seem to know such a lot for
somebody who knows so very little.

37:47.575 --> 37:50.250
You should know that I
am a very dangerous man.

37:50.300 --> 37:52.250
I was told that, too.

37:53.800 --> 37:56.000
And who keeps
telling you all this shit?

37:56.050 --> 37:59.200
I was told the details of your
situation by a representative

37:59.250 --> 38:01.600
of his Majesty The King, George.

38:01.650 --> 38:04.525
And indirectly it was the King
who financed the drawing up of

38:04.575 --> 38:07.525
that very expensive piece
of paper, which you just burnt.

38:07.575 --> 38:10.475
As a rule, the King's council
very rarely makes business

38:10.525 --> 38:14.250
with an actress unless it's up
the back alley of Maiden Lane.

38:15.375 --> 38:18.150
The piece of paper you just
burnt also states that,

38:18.200 --> 38:19.550
as Horace Delaney's widow,

38:19.600 --> 38:22.325
I also own half the trading
post at Nootka Sound

38:22.375 --> 38:24.925
and I believe Nootka is of value to you

38:24.975 --> 38:26.600
and to the King.

38:28.300 --> 38:32.325
So, as you can see, it's a very
simple swap, Mr. Delaney.

38:32.375 --> 38:36.250
Your half of the house
for my half of a piece of land

38:36.300 --> 38:39.450
that I have no interest in or use for.

38:39.500 --> 38:42.525
I also have a trunk full of
your father's belongings,

38:42.575 --> 38:46.725
letters to you, to your
father from your mother.

38:47.775 --> 38:49.775
Paintings of Nootka, drawings...

38:50.775 --> 38:52.350
No! No!

38:52.400 --> 38:53.750
Brace!

38:53.800 --> 38:55.600
Brace!

38:56.650 --> 38:58.125
Do I fetch the pistol?

38:58.175 --> 39:00.375
No. Make this woman
a room up right now.

39:03.925 --> 39:06.450
- I'd like a river view.
- Granted.

39:08.800 --> 39:12.650
Go on now. Make her a fire in my
mother's old room immediately.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.800
I hate to see these things caged up.

39:24.900 --> 39:26.875
If you are in contact with the King

39:26.925 --> 39:28.850
then you are already in grave danger.

39:29.800 --> 39:33.100
You may stay here whilst
we work out our business.

39:35.300 --> 39:37.300
Good evening, Miss Bow.

39:54.775 --> 39:56.250
I was passing,

39:56.300 --> 39:58.050
from Greenwich.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.800
I have business.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.250
Hm.

40:27.850 --> 40:29.875
I see in the Gazette
you now have a ship.

40:29.925 --> 40:31.350
Mm-hm.

40:31.400 --> 40:34.475
At 7:00 AM every day
I read the Gazette.

40:34.525 --> 40:36.975
My wife eats toast.

40:38.975 --> 40:41.375
I look for newly purchased ships.

40:43.975 --> 40:46.125
- I underwrite for Lloyds.
- Coffee?

40:47.500 --> 40:49.525
No.

40:49.575 --> 40:52.550
I'm willing to take care of
the insurance of your ship.

40:52.600 --> 40:55.000
I can make sure the hull
is tarred properly--

40:55.050 --> 40:58.125
they don't miss a layer
and pocket the change.

40:58.175 --> 41:01.450
The salt and worms will get through
and you'll sink off Africa.

41:02.575 --> 41:05.850
Ah, but my business is
not in Africa, it's out west.

41:07.725 --> 41:10.300
That letter there is from my carpenter.

41:12.650 --> 41:15.000
In my profession, we believe in luck.

41:15.050 --> 41:19.200
In the business of ship insurance,
luck is the Goddess of Profit.

41:19.250 --> 41:22.275
Your luck, Mr. Delaney, is poor.

41:22.325 --> 41:24.400
Your record is poor.

41:24.450 --> 41:26.725
You sink ships.

41:27.775 --> 41:30.000
You're as good as a hole in the hull.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
I did check the records.

41:33.050 --> 41:35.975
You were aboard a ship
that sank off Africa.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.575
A slave ship?

41:43.400 --> 41:46.600
I believe that a man
is capable of change...

41:47.650 --> 41:52.775
and I also believe that that
is of no consequence to you.

41:55.975 --> 41:57.750
And whilst you're here,

41:57.800 --> 42:00.600
this document will show you...

42:01.525 --> 42:04.750
that my ship is already insured
by an insurance broker

42:04.800 --> 42:06.450
by the name of Cope.

42:07.900 --> 42:09.750
And, if you look very closely,

42:09.800 --> 42:13.125
you will probably recognise
my handwriting.

42:29.900 --> 42:33.125
I wonder, does the offer
of coffee still stand?

42:34.525 --> 42:36.000
Mm.

42:48.375 --> 42:49.725
You know...

42:50.900 --> 42:52.750
it excites me,

42:52.800 --> 42:54.650
the thought of it...

42:55.525 --> 42:57.975
when I realise the woman beneath me...

42:59.000 --> 43:01.200
is capable of what she did.

43:03.525 --> 43:05.750
She can seem so cold,

43:05.800 --> 43:08.000
at least, she used to.

43:09.250 --> 43:11.450
Now I know the secret in her head.

43:13.775 --> 43:15.750
And it makes me so hard...

43:15.800 --> 43:17.775
and so angry.

43:20.800 --> 43:22.250
Mm.

43:22.300 --> 43:23.850
And she likes it.

43:25.925 --> 43:31.000
Since you came back, our fucking
has become almost murderous.

43:32.100 --> 43:34.250
It exhausts us.

43:34.300 --> 43:37.250
To think I have this wicked...

43:38.375 --> 43:42.925
wicked thing beneath me and it's
my lifelong duty to punish her.

43:45.850 --> 43:48.250
It exhausts us both.

43:49.900 --> 43:51.925
A beautiful exhaustion.

43:52.975 --> 43:55.950
And in the morning I read the Gazette

43:56.000 --> 43:57.975
and she eats her toast...

43:59.125 --> 44:01.400
like a sweet little bird.

44:08.800 --> 44:12.250
I didn't come to sell
you insurance, Mr. Delaney.

44:14.300 --> 44:16.000
I came to thank you.

45:13.525 --> 45:14.900
You summoned me.

45:16.300 --> 45:18.100
I am here now. What do you want?

45:24.300 --> 45:26.375
Shall we pray?

45:32.325 --> 45:35.000
I used to think we were
the same person.

45:35.050 --> 45:36.925
We are.

45:37.925 --> 45:39.575
We're not.

46:06.500 --> 46:07.925
Now...

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
I never want to see you again.

46:12.400 --> 46:14.450
We will speak again.

46:14.500 --> 46:16.450
No, we won't.

46:16.500 --> 46:18.525
Oh, but we will.

46:58.050 --> 47:00.375
- Madam.
- Mrs. Delaney.

47:00.425 --> 47:01.850
Do you drink wine?

47:02.775 --> 47:06.200
- Not before a performance.
- There'll be no performance tonight.

47:06.250 --> 47:10.150
There will be a performance or there
will be a riot in Covent Garden.

47:10.200 --> 47:12.725
Until the necessary arrangements
have been made,

47:12.775 --> 47:15.200
I advise that you go
absolutely nowhere.

47:15.250 --> 47:18.200
As of now, you are a weakness.

47:18.250 --> 47:20.200
These fantasies elude me...

47:20.250 --> 47:22.625
If you go outside,

47:22.675 --> 47:25.200
they will find you and they
will find a use for you.

47:25.250 --> 47:26.975
I am seldom used.

47:28.000 --> 47:31.450
There is no "they" and there
will be a performance.

47:32.500 --> 47:34.200
Are you armed?

47:35.250 --> 47:37.725
Get me a carriage to
Drury Lane, would you?

47:39.775 --> 47:42.250
You have to get that woman
out of this house

47:42.300 --> 47:45.200
or I swear I will kill her
and her bloody canary.

47:49.200 --> 47:50.725
Brace...

47:51.900 --> 47:53.900
get two carriages.

48:05.250 --> 48:07.725
I see that you're bleeding again.

48:09.400 --> 48:11.125
I saw blood.

48:12.650 --> 48:13.800
How?

48:14.900 --> 48:17.750
Where? You searching the laundry?

48:17.800 --> 48:20.200
It is equally my business.

48:22.900 --> 48:26.125
It seems that jointly we are unable
to stop the moon from rising.

48:26.175 --> 48:29.850
Could you fetch some oranges?
I would like some oranges.

48:36.800 --> 48:41.200
Is it the goose or the gander
who has bad sauce?

48:53.575 --> 48:56.475
Do you know we can't
even afford new china?

48:56.525 --> 48:58.700
So that's your reason for not taking.

49:00.375 --> 49:04.550
The dock boys I pay in pennies
have litters of children.

49:04.600 --> 49:06.725
I just get blood.

49:20.775 --> 49:22.500
My dearest Zilpha...

49:23.525 --> 49:25.725
I apologise...

49:26.775 --> 49:28.975
that I am not related to you.

49:30.050 --> 49:32.200
But you could allow your cunt

49:32.250 --> 49:34.250
to swallow the work of an honest man,

49:34.300 --> 49:37.650
who will promise to
buy you the finest china...

49:38.650 --> 49:44.050
if you just agree to
stop fucking bleeding.

49:44.100 --> 49:47.200
- Oranges, madam.
- She doesn't want fucking oranges!

49:51.775 --> 49:53.975
We all know what she wants.

50:05.200 --> 50:09.250
How like you the young German,
the Duke of Saxony's nephew?

50:09.300 --> 50:12.075
Very vilely in the morning
when he's sober

50:12.125 --> 50:15.125
and most vilely in the afternoon
when he's drunk.

50:15.175 --> 50:16.525
[laughter]

50:16.575 --> 50:19.350
When he's best he's little
worse than a man,

50:19.400 --> 50:22.775
and when he's worst he's little
better than a beast.

50:23.925 --> 50:26.400
<i>- Hurry up!
- Vestris!</i>

50:26.450 --> 50:28.250
<i>Vestris!</i>

50:28.300 --> 50:31.000
Hey! Hey! If you're
here just for a wank,

50:31.050 --> 50:33.600
pull your pudding and get it over with

50:33.650 --> 50:36.175
and let the rest of
us enjoy Shakespeare!

50:37.200 --> 50:40.150
You can't fetch up
until you bring Vestris!

50:40.200 --> 50:41.275
Vestris!

50:41.325 --> 50:45.150
CROWD: Vestris! Vestris!
Vestris! Vestris! Vestris!

50:45.200 --> 50:47.600
Hey! Hey!

50:47.650 --> 50:49.775
[cheering]

51:37.050 --> 51:38.725
Lorna Bow?

51:39.775 --> 51:42.275
I am an admirer of your work.

51:42.325 --> 51:43.975
Please, share my carriage.

51:48.400 --> 51:50.000
Come, come.

51:56.850 --> 51:59.775
If you could take me to Old
Street, I'll find a cab.

52:00.800 --> 52:03.325
You looked to be fleeing from someone.

52:04.250 --> 52:05.975
You were following me?

52:07.050 --> 52:10.600
You have many suitors
among the rabble, I imagine,

52:10.650 --> 52:13.700
and I, for the longest time,
have been one of them.

52:17.800 --> 52:20.500
I am a lady of particular tastes.

52:22.100 --> 52:25.725
An admirer from the darkness
and from on high.

52:29.200 --> 52:30.525
Oh...

52:30.575 --> 52:32.400
I'm sorry...

52:32.450 --> 52:35.000
but you'll have to remain
in the darkness.

52:35.050 --> 52:37.000
Why have we turned?

52:37.050 --> 52:39.250
We were given your name.

52:39.300 --> 52:41.525
The price was two sovereigns.

52:41.575 --> 52:43.750
I'm not a courtesan.

52:43.800 --> 52:48.475
But we are here and there
is a room with a bed and fire.

52:48.525 --> 52:51.325
Now this gentleman is a Duke.

52:51.375 --> 52:54.725
He asked for you particularly and
he was told by your theatre manager

52:54.775 --> 52:56.525
you would comply.

52:56.575 --> 52:59.450
He will pay to be in the room
with us while we play.

53:02.125 --> 53:04.775
- Then you were given the wrong name.
- There she is.

53:06.300 --> 53:07.975
Give her to me.

53:09.800 --> 53:11.500
Very well.

53:12.800 --> 53:17.000
Your manager sold me
the costume you wore

53:17.050 --> 53:20.075
when you played The Little Princess.

53:20.125 --> 53:21.925
You will wear it for me tonight.

53:24.725 --> 53:26.500
[gunshot]

53:27.575 --> 53:30.250
There appears to have been
a misunderstanding.

53:30.300 --> 53:32.725
Somebody has given you the wrong name.

53:32.775 --> 53:35.000
I'm the fucking Duke of Richmond.

53:35.050 --> 53:37.450
That bitch is dead.

53:39.575 --> 53:42.150
That bitch is on the gallows...

53:42.200 --> 53:44.000
before Mass!

53:45.975 --> 53:47.775
Down there.

53:51.050 --> 53:53.375
Perhaps now you will listen to me.

53:54.250 --> 53:55.725
This diamond...

53:55.775 --> 53:57.575
this is yours.

53:58.575 --> 54:00.750
I have a man that will
take you to Paris

54:00.800 --> 54:03.500
and you will stay there
until this business is done.

54:04.700 --> 54:06.775
You are a weakness.

54:20.775 --> 54:22.750
She's just come back.

54:22.800 --> 54:25.050
She went straight up to bed.

54:25.100 --> 54:28.775
I didn't light the fire in her room,
so she can dry in the draught.

54:31.300 --> 54:33.750
How many people know that she's here?

54:33.800 --> 54:36.500
Apart from me and the canary, no-one.

54:37.525 --> 54:39.125
What's wrong?

54:40.050 --> 54:41.725
Delivery boys, hmm?

54:42.775 --> 54:44.500
Only Atticus delivers.

54:45.575 --> 54:48.000
She's only ever taken one coach. Why?

54:49.600 --> 54:52.750
Because tonight she stabbed
the Duke of Richmond.

54:52.800 --> 54:54.250
For what reason?

54:54.300 --> 54:56.250
Because that was their plan.

54:56.300 --> 54:59.875
They knew that she was not a whore
and that she would fight back,

54:59.925 --> 55:02.450
and now they have a
good reason to come for her.

55:05.050 --> 55:06.775
And they will come.
