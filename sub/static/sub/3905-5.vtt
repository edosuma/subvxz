WEBVTT

00:32.406 --> 00:33.615
Thomas?

00:34.200 --> 00:35.451
Easy now.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.620
Sleep, child.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.373
Sleep.

00:52.552 --> 00:53.927
So the killer is still out there?

00:53.970 --> 00:56.764
Yeah. Probably crawled back
to the freaks that sent her after us.

00:57.599 --> 00:59.433
Did you have to quit being a cop?

00:59.642 --> 01:03.062
- How can that help?
- Alison, this isn't why I called.

01:04.147 --> 01:07.107
I want to thank you for helping with Kira.

01:07.567 --> 01:08.650
Oh.

01:08.818 --> 01:12.529
Yeah, I get to see her
tomorrow and you set that up. So...

01:12.614 --> 01:14.114
Well, she's a special little girl.

01:15.533 --> 01:17.034
I can tell. You're very lucky.

01:31.549 --> 01:32.758
No!

02:14.717 --> 02:16.260
- Hey!
- Beth, stop. it's me.

02:16.344 --> 02:17.928
Oh, my God!

02:18.012 --> 02:19.263
You asshole!

02:19.389 --> 02:20.931
You'd stab me in the eye with a nail file?

02:21.015 --> 02:22.724
Yeah! You sneak up on me in the shower,

02:22.767 --> 02:24.893
I am going to stab you
in the eye with a nail file.

02:26.104 --> 02:27.938
Aren't you supposed to be at Cody's?

02:28.439 --> 02:30.774
I didn't mean to scare you. I'm sorry.

02:32.443 --> 02:33.944
How sorry are you?

02:34.279 --> 02:35.487
Beth...

02:36.156 --> 02:37.364
Get in.

02:54.215 --> 02:55.424
Beth.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.259
Hmm?

02:59.429 --> 03:00.929
Let's go away.

03:03.933 --> 03:05.767
You're off the force,

03:06.978 --> 03:08.604
I hate my job.

03:10.773 --> 03:12.608
Let's pack our bags.

03:13.610 --> 03:14.776
Right now.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.613
I'm serious.

03:24.579 --> 03:26.997
Let's talk about it in the morning.

03:51.564 --> 03:52.689
Now, let's put it in now!

05:41.549 --> 05:45.052
- Hey, do you want coffee?
- Uh, no thanks.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.443
How you feeling?

06:02.445 --> 06:03.653
What?

06:07.450 --> 06:09.576
No gun, no badge...

06:10.244 --> 06:11.620
- Nowhere to be.
- Hmm?

06:12.121 --> 06:13.538
Let's leave.

06:14.290 --> 06:15.707
We don't have any ties.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.461
I have three simple words for you.

06:20.129 --> 06:21.797
Rio de Janeiro.

06:22.131 --> 06:25.592
We cannot just leave now
and think about going to Rio.

06:25.927 --> 06:27.135
Why not?

06:27.762 --> 06:28.970
It's what you wanted, right?

06:29.347 --> 06:30.639
Commitment? I'm ready.

06:31.724 --> 06:33.642
I can't think about this right now.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.770
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.

06:36.813 --> 06:37.854
You're shaking like a leaf.

06:37.980 --> 06:41.274
- Where are you going?
- I'm just going out for some air. Okay?

06:46.114 --> 06:49.533
It's an electrode
from an electroencephalogram array.

06:49.742 --> 06:52.244
- A what?
- An EEG helmet.

06:52.328 --> 06:54.955
It monitors electrical activity in the brain.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.374
So it wasn't a bloody dream then, was it?

06:57.458 --> 06:58.667
I knew it.

06:58.751 --> 07:00.043
How long have I been saying this?

07:00.128 --> 07:02.462
We're like lab rats in an illegal experiment.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.840
Sarah, where was Paul during all this?

07:05.091 --> 07:09.344
Uh, there were doctors, um...
Two or three of them.

07:09.387 --> 07:12.347
He could be in on it though.
Maybe he set it up.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.183
Well, somebody must be
watching the lab rats. Someone we know.

07:15.393 --> 07:17.978
Well, I mean,
if it were my experiment...

07:18.020 --> 07:20.856
Yeah, I would put an observer close to the
subject, you know, somebody to...

07:21.649 --> 07:24.359
Keep tabs and accumulate data.

07:24.569 --> 07:27.279
Cosima, what'd they do to me?

07:28.281 --> 07:32.367
I think you'd know if they'd
done anything really, um, invasive.

07:32.410 --> 07:34.536
- Oh, my God!
- I'm just saying...

07:34.579 --> 07:38.540
An EEG is like a neurological
test and that mark on your arm looks like...

07:39.292 --> 07:42.002
A blood sample. it sounds diagnostic.

07:42.086 --> 07:44.880
With Paul in on it... I don't know.

07:45.006 --> 07:47.132
Why? Just because he slept with you?

07:47.758 --> 07:48.884
Fe.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.307
Yeah, we sort of ended up shagging.

07:55.683 --> 07:58.518
Dude, that's complex.

07:58.769 --> 08:00.729
You slept with Beth's boyfriend?

08:02.565 --> 08:03.607
Oh!

08:04.358 --> 08:06.026
Far be it for me.

08:08.362 --> 08:10.238
I may be sleeping with my spy as well.

08:11.657 --> 08:13.909
There's the gun you wanted. I've got to go.

08:14.202 --> 08:15.494
Aye, aye, where's the money?

08:16.037 --> 08:18.497
What's it for?

08:19.332 --> 08:21.625
It's a self-defence fund, yeah?

08:21.959 --> 08:24.127
Last time I checked,
I'm the only one defending us.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.427
Here's 20,000.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.931
Please use it wisely.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.474
Yeah, I'll bring you the receipts.

08:39.101 --> 08:41.895
I'm gonna shoot Paul's balls off.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.188
Wait, just squeeze them, okay.

08:44.273 --> 08:45.690
He's our way into this whole thing.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.944
But if my blind subject
were suddenly to become...

08:49.946 --> 08:54.115
Self aware.
It'd either be a eureka moment or...

08:55.409 --> 08:56.618
Yeah?

08:56.786 --> 09:01.289
I would terminate. So, be careful, okay?

09:01.457 --> 09:02.749
On that note...

09:03.876 --> 09:06.294
--Shit!

09:07.838 --> 09:10.549
- Cop station, third time today.
- No, don't answer that.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.384
Uh, Art, what do you want?

09:12.802 --> 09:13.927
It's Raj.

09:15.054 --> 09:16.137
Um...

09:16.973 --> 09:18.473
I'm off the force, Raj.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.642
I know. You okay?

09:21.310 --> 09:22.811
- Yeah.
- Okay, well,

09:22.853 --> 09:24.563
you know that surveillance shit I lent you?

09:25.189 --> 09:26.856
I'm gonna need that back
before they inventory.

09:27.149 --> 09:28.316
Surveillance shit?

09:28.484 --> 09:29.651
Right. Right!

09:30.152 --> 09:31.486
And Beth, level with me.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.405
This is just about Paul, right?

09:33.489 --> 09:36.157
Look, I'll get it back to you
in a couple of days. Okay?

09:39.495 --> 09:41.329
So Beth had surveillance equipment.

09:42.081 --> 09:43.957
So then she was on to Paul too.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.875
Question is, did she find anything?

09:46.836 --> 09:50.547
It's critical. One week
she's fine, the next it's Armageddon.

09:51.299 --> 09:54.759
No, I understand that. But I don't
want to give her any reason to react.

09:56.637 --> 09:59.889
You tell me.
If it gets any worse, what are our options?

10:00.933 --> 10:02.684
What are you doing?

10:03.019 --> 10:04.686
- I have to call you back.
- Why...

10:05.021 --> 10:06.229
Why were you in my vanity?

10:06.355 --> 10:08.023
I need scissors.

10:15.156 --> 10:16.531
Who were you talking to?

10:17.033 --> 10:18.199
- Just now?
- Mmm-hmm.

10:18.242 --> 10:20.493
Uh, Big Rich. From work.

10:21.037 --> 10:23.121
- About me?
- About Susan Teller.

10:23.372 --> 10:25.332
She's all over us this quarter. You know that.

10:26.834 --> 10:29.919
Oh, good. Um, can you cut this tag off?
It's driving me crazy.

10:35.217 --> 10:36.551
That's better.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.769
All right.
What do we do if he walks in?

10:45.895 --> 10:47.228
Shoot him.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.856
I'm kidding. Just...

10:50.358 --> 10:52.734
Find the surveillance stuff, yeah?

10:53.027 --> 10:55.236
And put everything back where you found it.

10:55.905 --> 10:57.864
This place is antiseptic.

10:58.449 --> 11:00.909
Paul's whole world feels fake now?

11:02.578 --> 11:03.703
What?

11:04.080 --> 11:05.622
I don't leave prints when I burgle.

11:17.009 --> 11:18.760
"Trexcom Consulting."

11:23.683 --> 11:26.601
if fake Paul is observing Beth,

11:26.686 --> 11:29.354
what makes you so certain
no one's observing Sarah Manning?

11:29.689 --> 11:33.608
Who? Mrs. S hates me,
I haven't seen her in a year

11:34.276 --> 11:36.277
and I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt.

11:36.612 --> 11:38.405
A ringing vote of confidence.

11:41.867 --> 11:44.077
Nothing. On Beth's computer, nothing.

11:44.120 --> 11:47.706
No audio files, no video, no transcripts.

11:52.128 --> 11:53.795
Holy shit!

11:54.130 --> 11:55.797
Hey, hey. Hey.

12:06.058 --> 12:07.267
He's military.

12:12.481 --> 12:14.399
Looks like you're not
the only one keeping secrets.

12:15.401 --> 12:16.943
What are those?

12:17.486 --> 12:18.653
Letters from Beth.

12:18.779 --> 12:21.990
- To Paul? I wanna read them.
- Ah, ah, ah. No, they're private.

12:24.326 --> 12:26.661
Where the hell is his surveillance stuff?

12:26.996 --> 12:29.122
I don't know. We searched everywhere.

12:37.506 --> 12:38.923
There we go.

12:43.721 --> 12:45.680
She wasn't messing around, was she?

12:47.516 --> 12:49.684
Maybe it's time to check out
where Paul works.

12:50.186 --> 12:52.103
Oh, yeah. Trexcom Consulting.

12:52.521 --> 12:54.022
Fake Paul, fake company.

12:54.106 --> 12:56.691
I bet you money there's nothing there.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.549
No way.

13:29.391 --> 13:30.475
Beth?

13:32.353 --> 13:33.603
We downsized, remember?

13:33.729 --> 13:35.271
Paul's office is over here now.

13:36.315 --> 13:38.233
Oh, right.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.068
Yeah, of course.

13:40.611 --> 13:41.778
He's in a meeting.

13:42.196 --> 13:45.406
Oh! You know what, um...

13:46.158 --> 13:48.159
We kinda got into it... This morning.

13:48.244 --> 13:50.286
I brought him some lunch as a peace offering.

13:51.330 --> 13:52.580
Come on.

14:11.642 --> 14:12.851
I'll just...

14:13.352 --> 14:14.602
Sure.

14:43.841 --> 14:45.592
Big Boob Blowies?

15:03.652 --> 15:05.320
Felix, I hope you can hear this.

15:05.404 --> 15:06.863
Yes. Yeah, well, I can now.

15:06.947 --> 15:09.657
You silly bitch,
would you get your fanny out of there.

15:47.655 --> 15:49.530
- You brought me lunch?
- Yeah.

15:49.865 --> 15:51.115
Olive branch.

15:51.825 --> 15:53.159
About this morning.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.286
You wanna talk about it?

15:59.833 --> 16:01.793
I'd rather talk about last night.

16:01.877 --> 16:04.045
- In the shower.
- Paul...

16:04.964 --> 16:06.839
I came to bring you lunch, that's all.

16:10.886 --> 16:12.762
Something's changed both of us.

16:12.930 --> 16:14.889
Hmm...

16:15.349 --> 16:16.724
I know you can feel it.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.645
What happened to your scar?

16:21.981 --> 16:22.981
What?

16:23.065 --> 16:25.191
The scar on your neck
from the mountain bike crash.

16:25.317 --> 16:26.317
It's gone.

16:27.569 --> 16:29.237
Oh. Really?

16:31.490 --> 16:33.408
I'm using a new lotion.

16:35.911 --> 16:36.995
Let me see.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.581
You'll try anything, won't you?

16:40.791 --> 16:42.000
I will.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.671
But I gotta get back to work.

16:48.549 --> 16:49.799
Thanks for lunch.

16:51.468 --> 16:53.261
- See you tonight.
- Okay.

17:29.506 --> 17:30.923
Madison?

17:33.260 --> 17:34.802
Clear my afternoon. Okay?

17:34.970 --> 17:37.221
- Something came up.
- Shit.

17:48.358 --> 17:50.026
Alison? What are you doing?

17:55.157 --> 17:56.157
Ah...

17:57.826 --> 17:59.702
What's in the box, Donnie?

18:00.287 --> 18:01.454
It's private.

18:01.997 --> 18:04.332
No, it isn't. What is it? What is in it?

18:04.666 --> 18:07.668
- Tell me what's in the box.
- I'm entitled to a little privacy.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.505
- Even in this house.
- Oh! That's rich coming from you.

18:10.964 --> 18:13.257
- What the hell's that supposed to mean?
- Open the box, Donnie.

18:14.051 --> 18:16.177
- Give it to me!
- Open it!

18:16.762 --> 18:17.970
Alison.

18:18.138 --> 18:19.722
Alison, stop it!

18:41.078 --> 18:43.663
Yeah, blood looks fine. No infection.

18:43.997 --> 18:45.706
What kind of symptoms are we talking about?

18:45.874 --> 18:49.877
Um... Shortness of breath,
coughing up blood...

18:50.462 --> 18:52.880
- That sort of thing.
- Who's the subject?

18:53.215 --> 18:54.757
Uh, subject...

18:55.300 --> 18:58.219
- And if I told you that I'd have to kill you.

19:01.056 --> 19:05.226
And can you run a PCR on these samples.
See if there are any genetic markers?

19:05.894 --> 19:09.105
You're thinking antitrypsin deficiency,
cystic fibrosis.

19:09.189 --> 19:10.481
Yeah, that kind of thing.

19:10.774 --> 19:11.899
And, um...

19:12.192 --> 19:14.652
- Can you sequence for Cytochrome C?
- The barcode gene?

19:14.736 --> 19:15.736
Mmm-hmm.

19:15.779 --> 19:18.072
That's the one we use
for species differentiation.

19:19.116 --> 19:20.241
Is it?

19:20.742 --> 19:23.411
What's in it for me?

19:24.538 --> 19:27.081
Um, how about you get to have sex...

19:27.583 --> 19:28.749
With yourself?

19:30.752 --> 19:32.628
Awesome deal.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.361
I'm sorry.

20:30.604 --> 20:32.939
He's a bastard.

20:32.981 --> 20:34.357
Who?

20:35.359 --> 20:36.484
Paul.

20:36.944 --> 20:39.904
Beth loved him but he wouldn't love her back,
and he wouldn't leave her.

20:40.489 --> 20:44.116
Hmm, but he's certainly
changed his tune now, hasn't he?

20:44.868 --> 20:46.661
Sarah, he's falling for you.

20:46.828 --> 20:48.496
- God, what a mess!

20:51.458 --> 20:53.417
I'm outside Kira's school.

20:55.170 --> 20:58.297
Of all the things that scare me right now, Fe,
this one's the heaviest.

20:58.340 --> 21:00.258
You know she can't wait to see you, right?

21:00.342 --> 21:01.342
Yeah, thanks.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.345
She's the only thing
that really matters, you know.

21:06.014 --> 21:07.598
I know, um...

21:07.975 --> 21:09.433
Give her my love, okay.

21:14.606 --> 21:15.940
- Colin.
- Hi.

21:16.024 --> 21:17.692
So glad you could step away.

21:17.818 --> 21:21.028
From the morgue, uh, trust me,
scheduling isn't really an issue.

21:37.713 --> 21:38.921
Hey.

21:39.881 --> 21:41.590
It's me this time.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.345
I know.

21:53.395 --> 21:55.604
God, I missed you so much.

21:55.689 --> 21:56.772
I miss you too.

21:59.526 --> 22:01.485
Why are you wearing such fancy clothes?

22:04.031 --> 22:06.032
You don't miss a thing, do you?

22:10.912 --> 22:12.288
Are you okay, Mommy?

22:13.707 --> 22:15.916
Yeah, I am now.

22:16.251 --> 22:17.835
God, you're so big!

22:17.919 --> 22:20.338
- I'm the smallest kid in my class.

22:22.132 --> 22:23.591
Well, you're big to me.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.762
How come you never told me
about Aunty Alison?

22:28.430 --> 22:29.597
I didn't know her.

22:29.848 --> 22:31.390
She looks just like you.

22:31.767 --> 22:32.975
Yeah.

22:34.102 --> 22:36.812
One day I'll explain it all to you.
Yeah, monkey?

22:37.773 --> 22:39.774
Is someone trying to hurt us?

22:41.276 --> 22:42.568
Why'd you ask that?

22:43.278 --> 22:45.446
Alison said you're making sure we're safe.

22:46.740 --> 22:48.574
- Hey, hey.

22:49.785 --> 22:50.951
No.

22:51.828 --> 22:53.079
We're safe, Kira.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.540
I promise. Okay?

22:56.625 --> 22:58.125
You coming in?

23:22.401 --> 23:25.569
Hey. Sorry. You just forgot
this in the lab. Sorry.

23:25.695 --> 23:27.363
Thank you.

23:27.531 --> 23:30.991
Full disclosure, I did peek.

23:31.368 --> 23:32.910
You're French.

23:33.161 --> 23:34.829
You have killer grades.

23:36.123 --> 23:38.290
Thank you. Um, oh, God!

23:38.750 --> 23:41.210
I'm so sorry, I'm not usually like this.

23:41.545 --> 23:43.462
Oh. Bad breakup?

23:44.005 --> 23:47.675
- Yeah, well, we're an ocean apart so...
- Hmm, yeah.

23:47.884 --> 23:49.927
Long distance never works.

23:51.930 --> 23:54.598
Um, you're in microbiology too, right?

23:54.724 --> 23:58.561
Yes. Um, immunology.
I study host-parasite relationships.

23:58.645 --> 24:01.355
Oh, cool. Cool, yeah, I'm Evo Devo.

24:03.525 --> 24:07.236
- Evolutionary development.
- Yeah, yeah. That's what we call it here.

24:09.698 --> 24:10.865
Delphine.

24:11.032 --> 24:12.032
Cosima.

24:12.325 --> 24:15.578
Enchantée.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.374
So independent, aren't you?

24:21.376 --> 24:22.376
Hmm, monkey?

24:22.878 --> 24:24.587
- Little monkey.
- Remind you of anyone?

24:24.713 --> 24:27.214
Yeah, but I was much angrier, wasn't I?

24:28.341 --> 24:29.675
Even small.

24:31.678 --> 24:33.888
You were the one
who introduced me to punk rock, though.

24:35.390 --> 24:39.935
Yeah. You took all of the attitude,
none of the politics.

24:42.939 --> 24:45.733
I'm just happy she doesn't
have to bounce around like I did.

24:47.611 --> 24:49.904
I was her age when
I came to live with you in London, yeah?

24:50.197 --> 24:52.198
- Little bit older.
- Well.

24:53.575 --> 24:55.493
You got me this far.

24:57.245 --> 24:58.496
I know that.

25:01.291 --> 25:03.959
- I still need your help though.
- Ah.

25:05.086 --> 25:06.962
I need you to tell me

25:07.714 --> 25:09.840
what you really know about me.

25:10.592 --> 25:11.759
Where I came from?

25:12.010 --> 25:13.177
Why now?

25:13.261 --> 25:14.803
Trying to square things away.

25:15.430 --> 25:16.680
For Kira, you know.

25:17.682 --> 25:19.767
You're part of the foster system. I took in kids.

25:19.851 --> 25:22.102
You know, I don't know who
your parents were.

25:22.270 --> 25:23.896
Yeah, I talked to

25:24.648 --> 25:28.734
Family Services in Brixton already.
I just wondered if there's anything else.

25:29.319 --> 25:30.611
Is everything okay?

25:31.613 --> 25:32.863
Yeah.

25:33.198 --> 25:34.740
Yeah, I'm fine.

25:36.576 --> 25:37.910
What about Vic?

25:38.620 --> 25:40.663
- Vic still in the picture?
- God, no.

25:42.415 --> 25:45.084
That much I can promise. Vic is done.

25:54.511 --> 25:55.970
How you doing, boss?

25:56.179 --> 25:57.846
Nice to see you, Pouchy.

25:59.474 --> 26:01.976
Pouchy, she jumped

26:02.394 --> 26:03.811
in front of a train.

26:04.187 --> 26:05.271
I don't even know why she did it.

26:05.313 --> 26:08.148
Right, sure we had our ups and down
but everything was fine.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.775
She had the coke

26:10.068 --> 26:11.151
on her.

26:12.487 --> 26:15.322
So, I'm thinking maybe the cops have it.

26:16.366 --> 26:18.367
Give me one week, Pouchy.

26:19.536 --> 26:20.995
I'll get you your money.

26:22.414 --> 26:23.747
- You say that last week.
- I know.

26:23.832 --> 26:26.166
I'm good for it. Wait a minute,
I'm good for it, Pouchy. You know me.

26:26.251 --> 26:28.335
Pouchy, please. Wait a minute, Pouchy.

26:28.378 --> 26:30.713
One more week
I'll get you your money. Okay.

26:30.797 --> 26:32.172
Okay, okay.

26:32.465 --> 26:35.884
Pouchy, please.
One more week, man. Okay! Give me a minute!

26:35.969 --> 26:38.178
Don't cut it. Okay, all right.

26:38.346 --> 26:40.347
I'll give the money. Okay.

26:40.515 --> 26:43.017
Okay, give me a minute.
I just need the time.

26:48.064 --> 26:49.356
I'm good.

26:54.279 --> 26:55.362
Okay.

26:55.864 --> 26:58.032
One chocolate bar each.

26:58.575 --> 26:59.908
That's it.

27:00.535 --> 27:01.619
Okay.

27:02.704 --> 27:04.705
Hold your sister's hand.

27:05.540 --> 27:08.042
- Okay? And don't talk to anybody.
- Okay, Mom.

27:08.543 --> 27:10.336
- I love you.
- Love you too, Mom.

27:23.058 --> 27:25.643
Uh, deterrents or surveillance?

27:26.102 --> 27:27.686
Surveillance, please.

27:27.937 --> 27:29.188
Something small.

27:31.024 --> 27:33.192
You mean something like this?

27:33.276 --> 27:35.569
Wireless, discrete.

27:35.862 --> 27:37.529
They call it the nanny cam.

27:37.989 --> 27:39.657
Sometimes the nanny's pinching
your valuables,

27:39.741 --> 27:42.076
sometimes your husband's
pinching the nanny, you know?

27:43.745 --> 27:45.537
Just show me how it works, please.

27:56.257 --> 27:58.300
Stay in school.

28:00.387 --> 28:01.929
I mean it, buddy.

28:17.779 --> 28:19.113
Sarah?

28:22.659 --> 28:23.784
Sarah?

28:25.620 --> 28:26.704
Sarah.

28:30.458 --> 28:32.334
Sarah, hey, Sarah.

28:34.212 --> 28:35.629
Sarah, you're alive!

28:36.464 --> 28:37.589
Sarah, it's me.

28:39.217 --> 28:40.384
Look at me.

28:41.136 --> 28:42.636
I don't...

28:44.139 --> 28:46.557
- I don't know who you are.
- You bitch, you faked it.

28:46.641 --> 28:49.476
- You've got the wrong person.
- You faked it, you bitch!

28:49.561 --> 28:52.896
How could you do this to me?
Sarah, I thought you were dead.

28:52.981 --> 28:55.858
How could you goddamn do this to me?

28:57.485 --> 28:59.987
My eyes! Ah, you bitch!

29:01.364 --> 29:02.865
--Ah!

29:05.285 --> 29:08.120
- Ah, there you are.
- Goddamn it. Goddamn...

29:08.413 --> 29:10.497
Okay, it's a race into the car.

29:10.540 --> 29:12.499
- Me, me. First me.
- Sarah!

29:12.584 --> 29:14.460
Hey, whoever gets in first, wins.

29:14.502 --> 29:17.337
- Who's that guy?
- Uh, Sarah...

29:17.839 --> 29:19.006
You bitch.

29:23.386 --> 29:25.012
Hello, Alison.

29:25.180 --> 29:28.891
I was just assaulted by
a disgusting thug who thought I was you.

29:29.350 --> 29:30.893
Who? What'd he look like?

29:30.977 --> 29:32.144
I don't know, he was...

29:33.271 --> 29:34.396
Urban.

29:34.647 --> 29:35.939
What the hell does that mean?

29:36.441 --> 29:38.066
Not white, okay.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.903
Oh, shit! Vic.

29:41.863 --> 29:43.280
Wha... What happened?

29:43.448 --> 29:45.616
I assaulted him back is what happened.

29:46.326 --> 29:47.910
Please tell me that's not Kira's father.

29:48.077 --> 29:50.954
No, no. Absolutely not.

29:52.373 --> 29:53.916
Well, what's going on with Paul?

29:54.000 --> 29:57.044
Well, we think Beth was spying on him.

29:57.587 --> 29:58.921
We found surveillance gear.

29:59.005 --> 30:00.422
She never told me about that.

30:01.508 --> 30:03.967
Is it true? Is he a mole?

30:04.052 --> 30:05.511
I don't know that yet.

30:06.846 --> 30:08.222
What's going on with you?

30:08.473 --> 30:11.725
Nothing, I'm fine.
Call me when you know something for sure.

30:18.233 --> 30:19.399
Olivier?

30:21.903 --> 30:23.070
Paul.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.532
What are you doing here?
Is something wrong?

30:27.200 --> 30:28.784
We need to talk about Beth.

30:30.912 --> 30:32.371
How was she this morning?

30:33.540 --> 30:35.749
Fine. Everything's fine.

30:42.298 --> 30:45.384
You don't do
this sort of thing much, do you?

30:46.427 --> 30:47.928
You mean with a live person?

30:49.222 --> 30:50.973
Oh! Right...

30:51.224 --> 30:52.599
Morgue humor.

30:53.101 --> 30:54.518
You're awfully cute.

30:55.603 --> 30:56.728
Okay.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.441
Okay, bye.

31:01.943 --> 31:03.110
Bye.

31:09.993 --> 31:12.119
The morgue attendant? Really?

31:12.245 --> 31:14.830
- Can you knock?
- Brilliant, Fe.

31:14.914 --> 31:17.916
Shagging the bloke that
we conned into identifying my body.

31:18.209 --> 31:21.169
Colin is the first nice boy I've met in ages.

31:21.504 --> 31:23.630
- What? Like six weeks?
- No.

31:24.090 --> 31:26.258
- At least eight.
- Where do you think this is gonna go?

31:26.301 --> 31:28.176
- Hey?
- Oh, my God!

31:28.261 --> 31:30.637
I'm so sorry, I completely
forgot rule number one.

31:30.722 --> 31:33.265
That your life is always more
important than mine.

31:33.474 --> 31:35.642
No, it's just way more difficult.

31:36.477 --> 31:38.520
- Vic is back.
- No shit?

31:38.688 --> 31:41.398
Yeah, he ran into Alison
so he thinks I'm alive.

31:42.483 --> 31:44.276
I'll figure it out. I'll...

31:45.153 --> 31:46.987
I need to know what happened
at Paul's office.

31:47.405 --> 31:50.324
Sorry. I've been a bit busy, haven't I?

31:51.701 --> 31:53.619
Well, it did record something.

32:02.003 --> 32:03.712
What are you doing here?
Is something wrong?

32:04.297 --> 32:06.590
- This is it.
- We need to talk about Beth.

32:07.508 --> 32:11.094
- How was she this morning?
- Fine. Everything's fine.

32:11.512 --> 32:13.931
You still concerned about
her mental health?

32:15.016 --> 32:17.517
- No, she's better.
- Suddenly better?

32:18.436 --> 32:21.438
You understand your role as
monitor is not to interfere...

32:21.522 --> 32:22.689
Monitor?

32:23.066 --> 32:26.360
If there's anything pertinent
I should know, anything at all...

32:26.402 --> 32:28.028
If there were, I would tell you.

32:31.866 --> 32:33.075
Oh, shit! it's him.

32:33.409 --> 32:34.785
No, don't answer that.

32:35.036 --> 32:36.078
No!

32:36.162 --> 32:37.746
- Hello.
- Beth...

32:37.914 --> 32:40.290
- Where are you?
- Out. Where are you?

32:40.500 --> 32:41.833
We have to talk.

32:42.627 --> 32:44.711
- About what?
- I need you to come home.

32:45.254 --> 32:46.713
Yeah, I don't think so.

32:54.555 --> 32:55.847
He knows something.

32:56.224 --> 32:57.849
Well, you can't go back there. You know that.

32:58.393 --> 32:59.643
No, I can't.

33:06.901 --> 33:08.235
Oh, shit.

33:08.861 --> 33:11.780
- Oh, my God!
- Paul followed me straight to Kira.

33:16.577 --> 33:17.911
Is this a bad time?

33:24.168 --> 33:26.461
You tased me, you maced me.

33:26.921 --> 33:28.422
And you think I'm just gonna...

33:29.298 --> 33:31.425
I'm just gonna walk away, like I'm nobody?

33:32.427 --> 33:34.594
- I was working a job.
- Uh-huh.

33:34.679 --> 33:35.721
Oh, yeah?

33:35.763 --> 33:37.097
Yeah, you would have ruined the whole thing.

33:37.181 --> 33:38.348
Yeah?

33:38.808 --> 33:40.559
I guess you're on a roll now, huh, Sarah?

33:43.146 --> 33:45.105
And that coke that you stole from me?

33:46.607 --> 33:48.025
Pretending to be dead.

33:49.110 --> 33:50.944
Who do you think took the fall for that?

33:51.487 --> 33:52.654
Huh?

33:53.990 --> 33:55.449
Pouchy took my finger.

33:57.243 --> 33:59.828
If I don't come up with 15K...

34:00.246 --> 34:01.455
He's gonna lobster me.

34:01.539 --> 34:03.999
A finger every week
until all I have left is a lobster claw.

34:04.083 --> 34:05.667
Sit down, sit down.

34:05.752 --> 34:07.461
Do you want the money or not?

34:17.304 --> 34:18.804
There's 20K.

34:18.889 --> 34:21.850
Fifteen for your debt and then
five for your pain and suffering.

34:22.351 --> 34:24.061
It must have been some play.

34:25.646 --> 34:26.938
Uh-uh.

34:27.482 --> 34:30.525
This is piss-off money, okay?
You don't get to know anything.

34:32.110 --> 34:34.112
I'm entitled to know everything.

34:36.239 --> 34:38.784
Can I ask you a question? How do you do it?

34:40.495 --> 34:42.245
Lying there in that morgue?

34:42.830 --> 34:46.333
Holding your breath, Sarah,
while I am bawling?

34:46.876 --> 34:49.293
I'm crying like a goddamn child.

34:52.422 --> 34:53.965
You know what's crazy?

34:54.217 --> 34:55.926
You know how stupid I am?

34:56.677 --> 34:58.678
I'm standing here looking at you

34:59.472 --> 35:01.348
and all I keep thinking about is Myrtle Beach.

35:02.058 --> 35:05.060
- You remember?
- Out. Yeah, that was a long time ago, Vic.

35:05.353 --> 35:07.896
I was working with that mook Angel,
he got you in with the carnies.

35:08.189 --> 35:09.773
I'm not proud of what we did.

35:09.982 --> 35:11.191
We were on top of the world, Sarah.

35:11.234 --> 35:12.400
We were parasites.

35:12.485 --> 35:13.902
No. We were in love.

35:14.403 --> 35:15.612
Not me.

35:16.322 --> 35:17.781
Ever.

35:22.578 --> 35:23.995
I think, she means it, Victor.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.623
You want that money?

35:27.250 --> 35:28.792
Take it and go now.

35:31.045 --> 35:32.379
Right now, Vic!

35:33.965 --> 35:35.090
Okay.

35:38.636 --> 35:40.137
It's not over, Sarah.

35:46.060 --> 35:49.396
Is every man in your life
a complete wanker, except me?

35:49.939 --> 35:51.731
I need you to go to S's house.

35:52.733 --> 35:54.651
Make sure Kira's okay. Yeah?

35:54.902 --> 35:56.653
You're not going back to Paul's.

35:56.737 --> 35:58.029
I will not let him threaten my daughter.

35:58.072 --> 35:59.656
Sarah, you're not going back to Paul's.

35:59.740 --> 36:00.949
Sarah!

36:28.686 --> 36:30.187
No, it's fine. Don't worry.

36:31.314 --> 36:33.273
If anything else comes up, I'll let you know.

36:58.466 --> 37:00.008
- Felix called yet?
- Yeah.

37:00.092 --> 37:02.260
He just played me the recording.
I heard everything.

37:02.303 --> 37:03.637
Um, where are you?

37:03.679 --> 37:06.348
I'm about to go in,
and shoot Paul in the balls.

37:06.432 --> 37:07.641
Wait, Sarah.

37:07.683 --> 37:09.476
This is our chance to get answers.

37:09.644 --> 37:11.394
He followed me to Kira, Cos.

37:11.479 --> 37:14.648
I know, I know.
But he also covered for you. Right?

37:14.732 --> 37:18.610
That Olivier guy, he asked if anything was
wrong and Paul said no. Why?

37:18.903 --> 37:23.156
Because, I think
he might be falling for fake Beth.

37:23.282 --> 37:26.159
Yes! That's awesome.
That... You can use that.

37:26.452 --> 37:28.870
Who do you think
got me into this mess in the first place? Huh?

37:28.955 --> 37:30.830
Okay. I know. Just chill.

37:31.207 --> 37:34.125
I think that Olivier guy, he runs Paul.

37:34.168 --> 37:37.420
It sounds like some kind of double-blind.

37:37.838 --> 37:39.089
What are you going on about?

37:39.173 --> 37:40.757
They are keeping Paul in the dark too.

37:41.300 --> 37:43.051
Right? So that he can't
skew the results either.

37:45.012 --> 37:47.514
You mean, he may not even
know he's watching a clone?

37:47.598 --> 37:48.848
Yes, right.

37:49.308 --> 37:51.017
But Olivier definitely knows.

37:51.852 --> 37:53.395
Okay, he's the one that we need to get to.

37:53.729 --> 37:55.021
You mind if I get through Paul first?

37:55.106 --> 37:56.356
- Sarah?

38:11.455 --> 38:12.747
I'll sleep on the couch.

38:12.832 --> 38:14.916
Donnie, Donnie.

38:15.001 --> 38:16.710
You're right.

38:18.671 --> 38:20.422
Everyone deserves their privacy.

38:23.050 --> 38:24.175
Come.

38:45.448 --> 38:47.824
I thought you handed in your sidearm.

38:47.908 --> 38:48.908
Huh?

38:48.951 --> 38:51.036
Left jacket pocket, hanging low.

38:52.496 --> 38:54.914
Well, apparently, I've got a stalker.

38:58.210 --> 38:59.336
Sit.

39:02.631 --> 39:03.757
Put it on the table.

39:11.474 --> 39:12.974
I knew.

39:13.059 --> 39:15.435
I couldn't put my finger on it, but I knew.

39:16.771 --> 39:18.813
It was that day
you were supposed to do the hearing,

39:18.939 --> 39:20.231
first time we had sex in months.

39:20.941 --> 39:21.941
What? I missed you.

39:22.026 --> 39:23.818
You were wearing that Clash t-shirt.

39:23.903 --> 39:25.945
I was like, "What?"

39:26.947 --> 39:29.699
And then, wham, you screw me,
right on the kitchen counter.

39:31.118 --> 39:33.453
You complaining, Paul?
What are you saying?

39:33.537 --> 39:34.621
You quit the force.

39:35.122 --> 39:37.290
After refusing ever even to think it.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.209
You know what I've been through.

39:39.293 --> 39:41.878
And then the scar on your neck
just disappears. Because of what?

39:42.880 --> 39:44.297
Some cream?

39:44.757 --> 39:45.799
And now...

39:50.137 --> 39:51.513
This little girl.

39:53.641 --> 39:55.975
I was there when Beth
found out she couldn't have kids.

39:58.562 --> 40:00.188
So, who is this girl?

40:01.190 --> 40:02.524
She's my half-sister.

40:03.234 --> 40:04.609
I watched you together.

40:05.152 --> 40:06.653
She's your daughter, isn't she?

40:07.947 --> 40:09.531
You're losing it.

40:09.615 --> 40:10.824
Am I?

40:11.200 --> 40:12.867
I was looking at some old video today.

40:12.952 --> 40:14.869
You were training for that

40:14.954 --> 40:16.162
half-marathon.

40:16.831 --> 40:18.248
What was the last race you ran?

40:21.335 --> 40:22.544
What city was it in?

40:29.760 --> 40:31.261
Where is Beth?

40:38.144 --> 40:39.936
One last time,

40:41.689 --> 40:43.148
whoever you are,

40:44.483 --> 40:45.733
where is Beth?

40:46.110 --> 40:47.444
She killed herself.

40:48.904 --> 40:50.405
She jumped in front of a train.

40:51.532 --> 40:52.532
You're English.

40:53.868 --> 40:55.577
Who are you?

40:55.661 --> 40:56.661
I'm her twin.

40:57.163 --> 40:58.455
Twin?

41:00.082 --> 41:01.499
Is this a test?

41:02.168 --> 41:03.418
A test of what?

41:03.502 --> 41:04.919
Beth didn't have a sister.

41:06.464 --> 41:08.131
What's your name?

41:08.215 --> 41:09.299
Sarah.

41:09.383 --> 41:10.550
Sarah what?

41:11.260 --> 41:12.886
Sarah's good enough.

41:14.305 --> 41:16.556
When Beth died, I took her identity.

41:17.099 --> 41:18.141
Beth isn't dead.

41:21.770 --> 41:24.397
Look, I was just gonna
clean out her bank accounts.

41:24.482 --> 41:27.066
I didn't mean to get all tangled up with you.

41:28.027 --> 41:30.612
If she really is dead,
how do I know you didn't kill her?

41:30.821 --> 41:32.238
- 'Cause you killed her.
- What?

41:33.240 --> 41:35.074
You're her monitor, aren't you?

41:36.327 --> 41:37.660
And what's that?

41:37.745 --> 41:38.912
You observe her.

41:39.622 --> 41:41.873
You let people into her home.

41:42.541 --> 41:44.125
Like last night.

41:45.503 --> 41:48.546
Doctors came and medically
examined her in her sleep.

41:50.132 --> 41:51.883
And she knew.

41:58.265 --> 42:01.476
You're a plant and she killed herself

42:01.560 --> 42:04.729
because the man that she loved
turned her whole life into a lie.

42:05.940 --> 42:09.442
She knew you didn't love her and she couldn't
understand why you wouldn't leave.

42:09.610 --> 42:11.027
And now she figured it out.

42:11.820 --> 42:13.196
This isn't true.

42:15.074 --> 42:16.616
It is a sick test,

42:18.285 --> 42:19.410
isn't it?

42:20.955 --> 42:22.455
Isn't it?

42:23.332 --> 42:24.791
She trusted you.

42:26.460 --> 42:28.670
How could you do that to her?

42:34.635 --> 42:36.261
You think I had a choice.

42:38.597 --> 42:39.973
Just tell me why?

42:41.767 --> 42:43.476
They don't tell us why.

42:53.779 --> 42:55.655
Where did you go in the middle
of the night, Donnie?

42:55.739 --> 42:57.282
I don't know, Never Never Land.

42:57.324 --> 42:58.324
What's the emergency?

42:59.660 --> 43:01.327
- Hi.
- We're not late for the potluck?

43:01.412 --> 43:03.580
I may have a monitor dilemma of my own.

43:03.706 --> 43:06.916
It's really nice to make
a friend in the brave new world.

43:08.752 --> 43:10.003
That is a really good look on you.
