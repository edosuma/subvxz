WEBVTT

00:05.676 --> 00:06.707
WELL, I GOTTA GET GOING.

00:06.707 --> 00:09.610
I'VE MR. CARVER'S
BIOLOGY CLASS FIRST PERIOD.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.442
THE BONES IN THE ARM ARE:

00:11.442 --> 00:15.546
METACARPAL, RADIUS, HUMERUS,
PHALANGES, ULNA, AND CARPAL.

00:15.546 --> 00:17.618
THE WAY I REMEMBER IT IS:

00:17.618 --> 00:22.293
"MIKE RIPS HIS PANTS
UNDER CHEESE."

00:22.293 --> 00:23.654
WOULDN'T IT BE
FUNNIER IF IT WAS:

00:23.654 --> 00:26.527
"MIKE RIPS CHEESE
UNDER HIS PANTS"?

00:26.527 --> 00:29.500
( Stan laughs )

00:31.502 --> 00:34.105
"MIKE RIPS CHEESE
UNDER HIS PANTS."

00:34.105 --> 00:37.037
HE'S RIGHT, THAT IS FUNNIER.

00:38.339 --> 00:39.640
HEY, WHERE IS EVERYONE?

00:39.640 --> 00:41.172
( snoring )

00:41.172 --> 00:44.345
HEY, MR. CARVER.
MR. CARVER, WAKE UP.

00:44.345 --> 00:45.616
( gasps )

00:45.616 --> 00:47.778
OH, THANK YOU FOR WAKING ME.

00:47.778 --> 00:50.551
USUALLY I'M AWAKENED WHEN
MISS ROSE WALKS BY

00:50.551 --> 00:54.685
TRAILING THAT PUNGENT ODOR
OF SWEAT AND PROSCIUTTO.

00:54.685 --> 00:57.158
OH, I HAD PARMESAN.

00:57.158 --> 01:01.061
EITHER WAY, THE AROMA BRINGS
BACK MEMORIES OF MY CHILDHOOD.

01:01.061 --> 01:04.435
I GREW UP NEAR A DUMP IN NAPLES.

01:04.435 --> 01:06.497
MR. CARVER,
WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

01:06.497 --> 01:09.300
IT'S JUST YOU, ME, AND
PRINCIPAL RICHARD R. RICHARDS,

01:09.300 --> 01:12.273
AND HE NEVER LEAVES.
LUCKY DUCK.

01:12.273 --> 01:18.078
WELL, TODAY IS THE DAY
YOUR CLASSMATES SO QUAINTLY
REFER TO AS... DITCH DAY.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.180
REALLY?

01:19.180 --> 01:21.152
EVERYONE DITCHED SCHOOL TODAY?

01:21.152 --> 01:22.513
I WONDER WHY NO ONE TOLD ME.

01:22.513 --> 01:25.516
AVERY, I DON'T CARE.

01:25.516 --> 01:29.360
THE IMPORTANT THING IS,
AS SOON AS YOU GO HOME,
I CAN GO HOME.

01:29.360 --> 01:30.661
AND GET SOME SLEEP.

01:30.661 --> 01:33.424
I CAN'T SLEEP AT NIGHT.
MY WIFE KICK-SNORES.

01:33.424 --> 01:35.666
( imitates snoring )

01:35.666 --> 01:37.198
( bell rings )

01:37.198 --> 01:39.330
THERE'S THE BELL.
I'M NOT GOING TO MISS CLASS.

01:39.330 --> 01:41.232
WELL I'M NOT GOING TO GET UP
FROM THIS CHAIR.

01:41.232 --> 01:45.676
OH, CURSE THESE WHEELS
AND MY RECENT WEIGHT LOSS!

02:04.155 --> 02:05.756
MAX. LINDSAY.

02:05.756 --> 02:07.298
DOES SOMEONE WANT TO EXPLAIN

02:07.298 --> 02:09.260
WHY NO ONE TOLD ME
DITCH DAY WAS TODAY?

02:09.260 --> 02:12.463
ISN'T THE PURPOSE OF DITCH DAY
NOT TO HAVE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS?

02:13.604 --> 02:15.236
DAB ORGANIZED IT,

02:15.236 --> 02:16.467
AND SHE THOUGHT YOU
WOULDN'T BE INTERESTED.

02:16.467 --> 02:18.569
Stan:
DAB, SHORT FOR DABNEY.

02:18.569 --> 02:22.713
'CAUSE ABBREVS ARE IN.
OBVI.

02:22.713 --> 02:25.646
DAB, WHY DID YOU THINK
I WOULDN'T BE INTERESTED
IN DITCH DAY?

02:25.646 --> 02:28.319
LOOK, AVES, EVERYONE KNOWS
THIS ISN'T YOUR KIND OF THING.

02:28.319 --> 02:29.680
YOU'RE WAY TOO STRAIGHT.

02:29.680 --> 02:30.781
AREN'T YOU THE ONE WHO STARTED

02:30.781 --> 02:32.523
THE PETITION TO BAN PAJAMA DAY?

02:32.523 --> 02:33.884
I DIDN'T START THE PETITION.

02:33.884 --> 02:35.556
I JUST TALKED ABOUT DOING IT.

02:35.556 --> 02:39.390
I WAS TOSSED IN A GARBAGE CAN
LONG BEFORE I GOT THE CHANCE.

02:39.390 --> 02:42.193
WHILE I WAS IN THERE,
I FOUND MY OTHER PETITIONS.

02:42.193 --> 02:43.864
AVERY, IT'S OKAY.

02:43.864 --> 02:46.237
SCHOOL AND RESPONSIBILITY
IS YOUR THING.

02:46.237 --> 02:47.698
EVERYONE HAS THEIR THING.

02:47.698 --> 02:49.700
YOU'RE LIKE A TINY PARENT.

02:49.700 --> 02:50.841
I'M THE GIRL
WHO SETS THE TRENDS.

02:50.841 --> 02:51.842
SEE YA.

02:51.842 --> 02:53.344
Both: SEE YA.

02:56.377 --> 03:00.711
SHE SAID I WAS TOO STRAIGHT
AND CALLED ME A TINY PARENT.

03:00.711 --> 03:02.583
IS THAT HOW EVERYBODY SEES ME?

03:02.583 --> 03:04.555
YOU DID TRY TO GIVE ME
A TIME-OUT LAST WEEK.

03:04.555 --> 03:06.317
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID.

03:06.317 --> 03:08.889
LOOK, WE WOULD HAVE
TOLD YOU ABOUT DITCH DAY,

03:08.889 --> 03:10.391
BUT WE KNEW YOU'D NEVER DO IT.

03:10.391 --> 03:13.794
I FELT SO STUPID BEING
THE ONLY KID ON CAMPUS.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.496
ALTHOUGH I DID TAKE
THE OPPORTUNITY

03:15.496 --> 03:17.368
TO SIT AT THE COOL KIDS'
TABLE AT LUNCH.

03:17.368 --> 03:20.571
FELT PRETTY COOL.
SITTIN' THERE ALL ALONE.

03:20.571 --> 03:22.873
THAT DOES SOUND REALLY COOL,
AVERY.

03:22.873 --> 03:24.575
WHAT?
I'M TRYING HERE.

03:24.575 --> 03:26.637
YOU'RE SAYING NOTHING.

03:26.637 --> 03:28.539
I JUST CAN'T
BELIEVE NOBODY TOLD ME.

03:28.539 --> 03:30.541
WHERE ARE YOU GOING,
AVERY?

03:30.541 --> 03:32.683
I'M GONNA DITCH DITCH-DAY.

03:37.388 --> 03:39.620
STAN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

03:39.620 --> 03:41.522
AND WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME ABOUT DITCH DAY?

03:41.522 --> 03:43.824
AS THE SCHOOL MASCOT,
I HAD TO BE HERE.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.496
AND AS FOR WHY
I DIDN'T TELL YOU,

03:45.496 --> 03:46.627
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE GONNA FOCUS ON

03:46.627 --> 03:48.228
THE ONE THING I DIDN'T SAY.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.230
WHAT ABOUT ALL
THE THINGS I DO SAY?

03:50.230 --> 03:52.503
I'M A TALKING DOG.

03:52.503 --> 03:56.567
DO YOU THINK I'M
TOO STRAIGHT LIKE
EVERYBODY ELSE?

03:56.567 --> 03:57.938
I'D LOVE TO ANSWER
THAT QUESTION,

03:57.938 --> 03:59.940
BUT THEY'RE TAKING
THE DITCH DAY PICTURE.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.712
SEE YA.

04:04.545 --> 04:06.777
I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
TO CHANGE MY IMAGE.

04:06.777 --> 04:07.878
( phone beeps )

04:07.878 --> 04:09.720
BUT FIRST, I GOTTA
GET BACK TO SCHOOL.

04:09.720 --> 04:10.921
MY FREE PERIOD'S ALMOST OVER.

04:10.921 --> 04:12.353
Lindsay:
SAY CHEESE!

04:12.353 --> 04:14.785
COME ON, MRS. JOHNSON,
TIME TO TEACH ME GEOMETRY.

04:16.687 --> 04:17.928
Stan:
I FEEL BAD FOR AVERY.

04:17.928 --> 04:19.690
SHE WANTS TO CHANGE HER IMAGE,

04:19.690 --> 04:21.692
BUT ONCE YOU GET
A REPUTATION FOR SOMETHING,

04:21.692 --> 04:24.535
IT CAN BE HARD TO SHAKE.
LOOK AT ME.

04:24.535 --> 04:27.538
I'VE ALWAYS HAD A BIT
OF A BAD BOY REP.

04:27.538 --> 04:29.300
BAD BOY! BAD BOY!
BAD BOY!

04:29.300 --> 04:30.541
THAT'S RIGHT, BABY.

04:30.541 --> 04:33.744
DON'T YOU FORGET IT.

04:36.577 --> 04:38.679
BENNETT, BECAUSE I HAD
TO PARK IN THE DRIVEWAY,

04:38.679 --> 04:41.512
I WAS ATTACKED BY
A PACK OF WILD GEESE.

04:41.512 --> 04:43.584
ELLEN, IS THIS
ANOTHER LAME ATTEMPT

04:43.584 --> 04:44.715
TO GET ME
TO CLEAN MY STUFF

04:44.715 --> 04:47.388
OUT OF THE GARAGE
SO YOU CAN PARK THERE?

04:47.388 --> 04:49.720
BENNETT, BECAUSE I HAD
TO PARK IN THE DRIVEWAY,

04:49.720 --> 04:51.291
I WAS RAINED ON!

04:51.291 --> 04:53.864
THE NEIGHBORS CALLED TO COMPLAIN
THAT YOU JUMPED IN THEIR POOL.

04:55.766 --> 04:58.599
BENNETT, BECAUSE I HAD
TO PARK IN THE DRIVEWAY,

04:58.599 --> 05:01.532
I WAS SUNNED ON!

05:01.532 --> 05:03.033
YOU PAINTED YOUR FACE RED.

05:10.611 --> 05:13.814
OHH!

05:13.814 --> 05:18.419
BENNETT, BECAUSE I HAD
TO PARK IN THE DRIVEWAY,
I WAS WINDED ON!

05:18.419 --> 05:21.392
WELL, I'M GLAD THOSE
MIME CLASSES PAID OFF.

05:23.053 --> 05:25.896
SO, YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING
WITH GEESE ATTACK.

05:25.896 --> 05:28.829
YES, I WAS VICIOUSLY GOOSED
IN THE DRIVEWAY.

05:30.100 --> 05:32.032
OKAY, FINE,
I'M MAKING A POINT.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.634
YOU HAVE A CHOICE.

05:33.634 --> 05:36.336
GO IN THE GARAGE
AND CLEAR OUT ALL YOUR JUNK,

05:36.336 --> 05:37.608
SO I CAN PARK MY CAR THERE.

05:37.608 --> 05:38.769
OR?

05:38.769 --> 05:40.441
PERHAPS I MISLED YOU

05:40.441 --> 05:41.712
WITH THE USE
OF THE WORD "CHOICE."

05:42.873 --> 05:44.715
DADDY, DADDY!

05:44.715 --> 05:47.117
MOMMY WAS ATTACKED
BY A PACK OF WILD GEESE!

05:47.117 --> 05:49.019
YOU'RE TOO LATE.

05:49.019 --> 05:50.781
DO I STILL GET MY DOLLAR?

05:50.781 --> 05:53.884
MAMA DON'T GET HER GARAGE,
BABY DON'T GET HER DOLLAR.

05:53.884 --> 05:56.687
MAKES SENSE.

05:56.687 --> 05:59.059
SO CAN DARCY COME OVER
FOR A PLAYDATE TOMORROW?

05:59.059 --> 06:01.432
I'M SORRY, SWEETIE.
TOMORROW I WILL BE BUSY

06:01.432 --> 06:04.895
SUPERVISING A VERY BIG CHILD
AS HE CLEANS OUT THE GARAGE.

06:04.895 --> 06:07.097
( laughing )

06:07.097 --> 06:08.599
THAT'S REALLY FUNNY, MOMMY!

06:08.599 --> 06:11.742
STILL NOT GETTING YOUR DOLLAR.

06:11.742 --> 06:13.744
( stops laughing)
FINE, IT WASN'T THAT FUNNY.

06:16.447 --> 06:18.749
HEY, MAYBE TYLER CAN BABYSIT
FOR CHLOE'S PLAYDATE.

06:18.749 --> 06:21.151
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT.
THE INTERNET IS UPLOADING

06:21.151 --> 06:22.953
OVER THREE DAYS
OF VIDEO EVERY MINUTE.

06:22.953 --> 06:25.516
I'M WAY BEHIND.

06:25.516 --> 06:28.619
GOOD. DARCY WOULDN'T WANT
YOU BABYSITTING US ANYWAY.

06:28.619 --> 06:29.990
SHE DOESN'T LIKE YOU.

06:29.990 --> 06:32.763
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

06:32.763 --> 06:35.596
EVERYONE LIKES ME.

06:37.828 --> 06:39.630
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOUR FRIEND DOESN'T LIKE ME?

06:39.630 --> 06:42.132
YOU KNOW HOW YOU FEEL WHEN YOU
REALLY, REALLY LIKE SOMEONE?

06:42.132 --> 06:43.133
YEAH.

06:43.133 --> 06:45.906
SHE FEELS THE OPPOSITE.

06:45.906 --> 06:49.510
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
EVERYBODY LIKES ME.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.411
LIKABILITY IS MY THING.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.784
IT'S WHAT PEOPLE
LIKE MOST ABOUT ME.

06:53.784 --> 06:56.687
NOT MY PEOPLE.

06:56.687 --> 06:58.949
YES, YOUR PEOPLE.

06:58.949 --> 07:00.951
ALL PEOPLE.
EVERYONE HAS TO LIKE ME.

07:00.951 --> 07:03.794
I BET YOUR FRIEND WOULD
LIKE ME IF SHE KNEW ME BETTER.

07:03.794 --> 07:05.155
YOU HAVE TO LET ME BABYSIT.

07:05.155 --> 07:07.558
OKAY, BUT YOU BETTER BE GOOD.

07:07.558 --> 07:09.830
KIDS MY AGE HAVE A
VERY SHORT ATTENTION SPAN.

07:09.830 --> 07:13.133
DON'T WORRY, I KNOW HOW TO KEEP
YOU GUYS ON THE EDGE OF YOUR--

07:16.567 --> 07:18.739
ARE YOU STILL TALKING?

07:21.542 --> 07:23.674
HEY, DAD. CAN
I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

07:23.674 --> 07:26.717
YEAH, OF COURSE.
YOU KNOW YOU CAN ALWAYS
TALK TO YOUR OLD DAD.

07:27.848 --> 07:30.681
IT'S ABOUT MY
TEENAGE REBELLION.

07:30.681 --> 07:34.625
AVERY, I CAN TELL YOU
AS A PSYCHOLOGIST,

07:34.625 --> 07:37.958
TEENAGE REBELLION
IS NOT MANDATORY.

07:37.958 --> 07:41.061
YOU CAN SKIP IT AND JUST
HAVE A REALLY INTENSE
MID-LIFE CRISIS.

07:42.533 --> 07:46.466
I JOINED AN EXTREME
IN-LINE SKATING TEAM.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.839
NO, I'M NOT REBELLING.

07:48.839 --> 07:50.501
KIDS THINK I'M
A GOODY-TWO-SHOES.

07:50.501 --> 07:52.643
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
WELL, THAT'S MY PROBLEM.

07:52.643 --> 07:55.045
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO GET INTO YOUR PROBLEM.

07:55.045 --> 07:58.679
YOU'RE NOT A GOODY-TWO-SHOES.
THAT'S AN EXAGGERATION.

07:58.679 --> 07:59.810
I WAS VOTED MOST LIKELY

07:59.810 --> 08:02.012
TO BECOME A CORPORATE
WHISTLE BLOWER.

08:02.012 --> 08:06.587
WELL, YOU DID TURN YOUR SCHOOL
IN FOR TITLE NINE VIOLATIONS.

08:06.587 --> 08:07.918
THE CASE IS STILL PENDING.

08:07.918 --> 08:10.761
WE NEED A GIRLS'
FOOTBALL TEAM!

08:10.761 --> 08:12.923
SWEETIE, WHY DO
YOU NEED TO CHANGE?

08:12.923 --> 08:16.096
I'VE ALWAYS TAUGHT YOU
TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT WHO YOU ARE.

08:16.096 --> 08:19.770
NO, I KNOW AND THAT'S
WHAT'S SO HARD ABOUT THIS.

08:19.770 --> 08:21.532
I DON'T WANT TO
CHANGE WHO I AM,

08:21.532 --> 08:23.774
BUT I WANT TO GET A LITTLE
OUT OF MY COMFORT ZONE

08:23.774 --> 08:26.577
AND SHOW THERE'S MORE TO ME
THAN BEING A GOODY-TWO-SHOES.

08:26.577 --> 08:29.179
YOU MIGHT WANT TO STOP
SAYING "GOODY-TWO-SHOES."

08:29.179 --> 08:31.542
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE
REALLY SAY THAT ANYMORE.

08:31.542 --> 08:32.613
THERE'S NOT A GOOD SYNONYM!

08:32.613 --> 08:34.645
I EVEN MADE UP
"BETTY-NICE-BOOTS,"

08:34.645 --> 08:36.947
BUT I LOOKED IT UP ON
THE INTERNET AND APPARENTLY

08:36.947 --> 08:40.751
IT'S AN INSULT FOR SOMEONE WHO'S
ALWAYS FLAUNTING THEIR BOOTS.

08:40.751 --> 08:45.025
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
I WENT THROUGH SOMETHING
SIMILAR A FEW YEARS BACK.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.828
I MEAN NOT FLAUNTING MY BOOTS,
ALTHOUGH THEY WERE NICE.

08:47.828 --> 08:51.802
NO, I BROKE OUT OF MY SHELL

08:51.802 --> 08:56.266
AND...UH...
GOT A LITTLE NUTS.

08:58.869 --> 09:01.942
WOW, YOU WERE IN
A HEAVY METAL BAND?

09:01.942 --> 09:07.618
OH NO, I JUST GOT
REALLY DEEP INTO
THE PHOTOSHOP SCENE.

09:07.618 --> 09:09.850
YEAH, THAT MAKES MORE SENSE.

09:09.850 --> 09:13.784
AND YOU'LL FIND WHAT
MAKES SENSE FOR YOU.

09:13.784 --> 09:17.227
SOMETHING THAT TAKES YOU A
LITTLE OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE

09:17.227 --> 09:19.760
BUT STAYS TRUE TO WHO YOU ARE.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.231
THANKS, DAD.

09:21.231 --> 09:22.963
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
REALLY GOOD AT THIS.

09:22.963 --> 09:27.738
WELL, I DID TRAIN
WITH SIGMUND FREUD.

09:34.004 --> 09:36.707
OKAY, I'M GONNA MAKE
CHLOE'S FRIEND LIKE ME.

09:36.707 --> 09:39.349
HERE'S MY PLAN.
I'LL ASK HER NAME,

09:39.349 --> 09:41.652
SHE'LL TELL ME HER NAME,
AND I'LL TELL HER THAT MEANS

09:41.652 --> 09:44.014
"BEAUTIFUL" IN GREEK.
BOOM, SHE LOVES ME.

09:44.014 --> 09:47.587
I THOUGHT MY NAME MEANT
"BEAUTIFUL" IN GREEK.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.859
YOU LOVE ME, DON'T YOU?

09:48.859 --> 09:51.191
I DO.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.664
I'M GONNA TRY THAT
ON THE POODLE NEXT DOOR.

09:53.664 --> 09:57.367
DON'T BE TOO EAGER, BE COOL.
BE COOL.

09:57.367 --> 10:00.771
CAN YOU BELIEVE YOUR
FATHER STILL HAS THIS
OLD BEAN BAG CHAIR?

10:00.771 --> 10:01.872
( chirping )

10:01.872 --> 10:03.133
OKAY, IT'S NOT
ALL BEANS IN HERE.

10:03.133 --> 10:04.835
IT'S MOVING.

10:04.835 --> 10:06.707
( doorbell rings )

10:06.707 --> 10:08.208
I'LL GET IT!

10:10.681 --> 10:12.382
BYE, MOMMY!
I'LL SEE YOU LATER!

10:12.382 --> 10:16.046
I DON'T KNOW WHEN!
I'LL CALL YOU!

10:17.748 --> 10:18.749
HEY, DARCY.

10:18.749 --> 10:20.891
DARCY, HEY.

10:20.891 --> 10:23.023
DID YOU KNOW YOUR NAME MEANS
"BEAUTIFUL" IN GREEK?

10:23.023 --> 10:25.756
WOW.

10:25.756 --> 10:27.858
I KNOW.

10:27.858 --> 10:29.960
SLY BROW.

10:31.361 --> 10:32.863
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOUR FACE?

10:32.863 --> 10:34.004
NOTHING?

10:34.004 --> 10:35.305
I DON'T LIKE HIM.

10:35.305 --> 10:36.707
I TRIED TO TELL HIM.

10:36.707 --> 10:38.068
SOME JUST PEOPLE
DON'T LISTEN.

10:38.068 --> 10:40.841
THAT'S VERY UNLIKABLE.

10:42.813 --> 10:44.945
CAN YOU BELIEVE SHE WAS
GETTING RID OF MY BEAN BAG?

10:44.945 --> 10:46.817
YOU JUST HAVE TO
SHAKE THE MICE OUT.

10:46.817 --> 10:47.918
IT'S GOOD AS NEW.

10:50.721 --> 10:54.124
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
SHE REALLY DOESN'T LIKE ME.

10:54.124 --> 10:55.425
I KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD DO.

10:55.425 --> 10:57.828
GET A BACON CHEESEBURGER
AND PUT IT ON THE FLOOR.

10:57.828 --> 10:59.229
HOW IS THAT GOING
TO MAKE HER LIKE ME?

10:59.229 --> 11:01.431
OH, YOU WANNA LOSE ME, TOO?
IS THAT IT?

11:03.063 --> 11:06.797
LOOK, WHEN DOGS WANT PEOPLE
TO LIKE THEM, THEY DO TRICKS.

11:06.797 --> 11:08.098
WHAT'S YOUR BEST TRICK?

11:09.099 --> 11:10.100
ALL RIGHT, GIRLS.

11:10.100 --> 11:11.802
READY FOR MY BEST TRICK?

11:20.851 --> 11:22.212
Stan:
LOOKS LIKE OL' TYLER

11:22.212 --> 11:24.414
IS GETTIN' IN OVER
HIS HEAD ON THIS ONE.

11:24.414 --> 11:27.287
I'M ALMOST AFRAID TO UNFREEZE.

11:31.091 --> 11:33.764
AAH!
( thud )

11:33.764 --> 11:38.128
AND THAT'S WHY MOMMY SAYS
NO BIKES IN THE HOUSE.

11:38.128 --> 11:41.431
WHY DOES YOUR FATHER HAVE A
TROLL DOLL, A STUFFED DOLPHIN,

11:41.431 --> 11:43.173
AND A REMOTE CONTROL CAR?

11:43.173 --> 11:46.236
AND WHY IS HIS MID-LIFE CRISIS
EXTREME IN-LINE SKATE RAMP

11:46.236 --> 11:47.738
BACK IN THE FAMILY ROOM?

11:51.481 --> 11:52.813
WELL?

11:52.813 --> 11:54.714
THAT WAS AWESOME!

11:54.714 --> 11:55.715
IT WAS?

11:55.715 --> 11:56.747
YEAH!

11:56.747 --> 11:59.089
I LOVE SEEING PEOPLE
I DON'T LIKE GET HURT.

12:04.724 --> 12:09.830
WHAT KIND OF GRINCHY FUN-HATER
WOULD TRY TO GET RID
OF MY TROLL-DOLPHIN-MOBILE?

12:11.862 --> 12:14.835
HEY, GRINCHY FUN-HATER.

12:14.835 --> 12:17.838
BENNETT, WHAT IS GOING ON?

12:17.838 --> 12:19.739
I TAKE STUFF FROM
THE GARAGE TO THE DUMPSTER,

12:19.739 --> 12:20.871
IT ENDS UP RIGHT BACK
IN THE HOUSE.

12:20.871 --> 12:24.044
INCLUDING NEW STUFF.
WHERE DID THIS COME FROM?

12:24.044 --> 12:26.146
WHEN THE WOMAN NEXT DOOR
SAW OUR DUMPSTER,

12:26.146 --> 12:27.978
SHE STARTED THROWING STUFF OUT.

12:27.978 --> 12:30.520
ISN'T THIS COOL?

12:30.520 --> 12:32.122
SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

12:32.122 --> 12:35.455
YOU ARE NOW DUMPSTER DIVING
FOR STUFF THAT THE CAT LADY
THREW AWAY.

12:36.787 --> 12:38.789
AND SNOWSHOES, BENNETT?
REALLY?

12:38.789 --> 12:42.963
HEY--HEY, THESE SNOWSHOES
WERE WORN BY MY UNCLE HENNY
IN THE BLIZZARD OF '29,

12:42.963 --> 12:48.168
WHEN HE WALKED FROM ANCHORAGE
TO NOME TO GET THE MEDICINE THAT
SAVED MY GRANDFATHER'S LIFE.

12:48.168 --> 12:49.539
IF IT WEREN'T FOR
THESE SNOWSHOES,

12:49.539 --> 12:52.843
I WOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE TODAY.

12:52.843 --> 12:56.276
OR DID I BUY THESE LAST YEAR
AT THE ROSE BOWL FLEA MARKET?

12:57.547 --> 13:01.411
MOMMY, I SAW SO MANY WONDERFUL
THINGS IN THE DUMPSTER,

13:01.411 --> 13:05.215
THINGS THAT WILL MAKE
MY CHILDHOOD MAGICAL.

13:05.215 --> 13:07.888
DID DADDY PUT YOU
UP TO THIS, CHLOE?

13:07.888 --> 13:10.520
DUH!
WHO ELSE LIKES SCARY GARBAGE?

13:12.562 --> 13:14.564
DO I STILL GET MY DOLLAR?

13:14.564 --> 13:19.429
DADDY CAN'T KEEP HIS TRASH,
BABY DON'T GET NO CASH.

13:24.074 --> 13:26.907
STAN, I NEED AN ACT
OF REBELLION IMPRESSIVE ENOUGH

13:26.907 --> 13:29.479
TO GET ME SOCIAL CRED THAT
STILL STAYS TRUE TO WHO I AM.

13:29.479 --> 13:31.982
SOMETHING CRAZY!
SOMETHING NO ONE ELSE IS DOING!

13:31.982 --> 13:34.084
LIKE WEARING TIES!
WHICH I ALREADY DO!

13:34.084 --> 13:36.416
SO CLEARLY, THAT DOESN'T WORK!

13:36.416 --> 13:38.218
YOU WANT IN ON MY THING?

13:39.249 --> 13:40.921
I'M CHEWING
BENNETT'S DESK LEGS

13:40.921 --> 13:42.522
DOWN ONE INCH AT A TIME UNTIL

13:42.522 --> 13:44.524
ONE DAY HIS KNEES
WON'T FIT UNDER IT.

13:44.524 --> 13:47.998
WITH BOTH OF US WORKING,
IT'LL GO TWICE AS FAST.

13:53.463 --> 13:56.336
I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I USUALLY
SWELL UP IN THE SPRING.

13:58.008 --> 13:59.970
STAN, ARE YOU CHEWING
ON MY DESK LEG?

13:59.970 --> 14:02.842
HUH?

14:02.842 --> 14:05.215
WHY CAN'T I THINK OF ANYTHING?

14:05.215 --> 14:07.377
RELAX.
GNAW ON SOME LEG.

14:07.377 --> 14:08.548
IT'LL TAKE THE EDGE OFF.

14:08.548 --> 14:09.619
NO THANKS.

14:09.619 --> 14:14.584
IT'S THE GOOD STUFF.
CAROLINA PINE.

14:14.584 --> 14:17.527
THIS ISN'T HELPING.
I NEED TO THINK OF SOMETHING.

14:17.527 --> 14:20.530
MAYBE YOU'RE TRYING TOO HARD.
MAYBE IF YOU JUST RELAX,

14:20.530 --> 14:23.233
YOUR ANSWER WILL COME
WALKING THROUGH THE DOOR.

14:23.233 --> 14:24.234
( knocking )

14:31.972 --> 14:33.643
CAN I STORE THIS BOX
IN YOUR ROOM?

14:35.545 --> 14:38.208
I BET YOU'RE WONDERING WHY
I'M WEARING THESE SNOWSHOES.

14:38.208 --> 14:40.650
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO SHOW MOM
THAT YOU'LL REALLY USE THEM.

14:40.650 --> 14:43.013
THE SAME REASON YOU'RE
WEARING THE TEN MOOD RINGS.

14:43.013 --> 14:46.486
YOU REALLY GET ME,
WHICH IS WHY I'M HAPPY.

14:46.486 --> 14:50.560
SO I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M ALSO
ANGRY, JEALOUS, AND SAD.

14:50.560 --> 14:53.023
I AM COMPLEX.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.299
I'VE GOT IT.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.301
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.173
YARN BOMBING!

15:03.173 --> 15:05.205
YARD BOMBING?
GREAT!

15:05.205 --> 15:07.077
YOU CAN HAVE THE WHOLE
LEFT SIDE OF THE YARD.

15:07.077 --> 15:08.378
OH, IT IS FUN.

15:08.378 --> 15:11.311
LESS SO SINCE I STARTED
EATING WOOD.

15:11.311 --> 15:14.114
NO, NO, YARN BOMBING.

15:14.114 --> 15:15.915
WHAT'S THAT?
YOU'LL SEE.

15:18.688 --> 15:22.222
OH, YARN BOMBING
WITH AN "N."

15:22.222 --> 15:24.654
THAT'S RIGHT.
THIS IS MY ACT OF REBELLION.

15:24.654 --> 15:25.695
( blows )

15:28.658 --> 15:31.701
WELL, I DID SOME
YARD BOMBING OVER THERE.

15:31.701 --> 15:35.435
IF YOURS DOESN'T WORK, YOU'RE
WELCOME TO TAKE CREDIT FOR MINE.

15:42.612 --> 15:44.174
WOW, COOL.

15:44.174 --> 15:46.616
SOMEONE YARN BOMBED
PRINCIPAL RICHARDS.

15:46.616 --> 15:47.617
WHO DID THIS?

15:47.617 --> 15:49.549
I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT:

15:49.549 --> 15:55.185
HER NAME STARTS WITH
AN "A" AND ENDS WITH A "Y."

15:55.185 --> 15:57.687
ASHLEY, THE LAME-O WHO MADE
THE STATUE OF LIBERTY FLOAT

15:57.687 --> 15:59.729
OUT OF TUNA CANS FOR
THE DOO DAH PARADE?

15:59.729 --> 16:01.531
NO.

16:01.531 --> 16:04.094
AMITY, THE GIRL WHOSE NAME
SOUNDS LIKE SHE'D BE FRIENDLY,

16:04.094 --> 16:06.596
BUT MOCKS PEOPLE'S HATS
BEHIND THEIR BACKS?

16:06.596 --> 16:08.138
NO.

16:08.138 --> 16:10.400
ANSLEY, THE TRANSFER STUDENT
FROM ENGLAND WHO THINKS

16:10.400 --> 16:11.971
SHE'S BETTER THAN US BECAUSE

16:11.971 --> 16:13.303
( English accent )
SHE TALKS LIKE THIS?

16:13.303 --> 16:14.704
NO!

16:14.704 --> 16:16.646
IT WAS ME, I DID IT.

16:16.646 --> 16:19.009
I FINALLY DID SOMETHING
TO SHED MY GOOD GIRL REP

16:19.009 --> 16:20.550
WITHOUT VIOLATING
ANY PRINCIPLES.

16:20.550 --> 16:23.413
WELL, EXCEPT THIS PRINCIPAL.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.587
WHAT DELINQUENT DID THIS?

16:27.587 --> 16:31.121
SOMEONE'S IN BIG TROUBLE.

16:31.121 --> 16:32.522
UH OH.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.496
I CAN TELL YOU WHO DID IT.

16:36.496 --> 16:41.101
HER NAME STARTS WITH
AN "A" AND ENDS WITH A "Y."

16:41.101 --> 16:45.405
ABBY, THE GIRL WITH THE FLOWERS
IN HER HAIR WHO PLAYS
THE FLUTE DURING LUNCH?

16:45.405 --> 16:47.677
NO, IT WAS ME.

16:47.677 --> 16:49.079
I DID IT.

16:49.079 --> 16:51.611
I'M SO SORRY, AVERY.
I DIDN'T REALIZE.

16:51.611 --> 16:54.514
I THOUGHT SOME DELINQUENT
WAS DEFACING SCHOOL PROPERTY.

16:54.514 --> 16:55.685
I WAS!

16:55.685 --> 16:57.517
IT WAS AN ACT OF REBELLION,

16:57.517 --> 17:00.050
ALBEIT ONE IN KEEPING
WITH WHO I AM,

17:00.050 --> 17:02.252
AND WITH WHO
PRINCIPAL RICHARDS WAS.

17:02.252 --> 17:04.794
LEGEND HAS IT DESPITE
HIS WALRUS-LIKE SKIN

17:04.794 --> 17:08.158
AND DOUBLE-BAGGED UNDERWEAR,
THE MAN GOT COLD EASILY.

17:08.158 --> 17:12.232
YES, WE ALL KNOW THE LEGEND
OF CHILLY RICK RICHARDS.

17:12.232 --> 17:15.034
AND I NOW SEE THAT IT
WASN'T A DELINQUENT

17:15.034 --> 17:17.607
DEFACING SCHOOL PROPERTY;
IT WAS OUR BEST STUDENT

17:17.607 --> 17:22.041
BEAUTIFYING THE COMMONS ON HER
OWN TIME AND AT HER OWN EXPENSE.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.414
BRAVA! BRAVISSIMA!

17:25.475 --> 17:26.676
PUT THAT FLUTE AWAY, ABBY.

17:26.676 --> 17:28.378
THIS ISN'T
THE RENAISSANCE FAIR.

17:29.719 --> 17:31.151
I LIKED THAT KNITTING THING

17:31.151 --> 17:33.253
UNTIL I FOUND OUT IT
WAS BEAUTIFICATION.

17:33.253 --> 17:34.724
IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE.

17:34.724 --> 17:37.087
IT'S STILL PRETTY,
IT'S JUST NOT COOL.

17:37.087 --> 17:39.259
LIKE A PONYTAIL ON A MAN.

17:43.463 --> 17:46.696
TYLER, AREN'T YOU
BABYSITTING CHLOE AND DARCY
AGAIN IN A FEW MINUTES?

17:46.696 --> 17:48.098
YOU LOOK HORRIBLE.

17:48.098 --> 17:50.370
YOUR SHIRT'S NOT EVEN TUCKED
IN BEHIND YOUR BELT BUCKLE.

17:50.370 --> 17:53.603
I KNOW.
I'VE LOST THE WILL TO TUCKLE.

17:53.603 --> 17:57.147
I CAN'T EAT, I CAN'T SLEEP.

17:57.147 --> 17:59.449
SOMEONE DOESN'T LIKE ME, STAN.

17:59.449 --> 18:01.781
MY LIKEABILITY IS MY IDENTITY.

18:01.781 --> 18:03.683
I DON'T KNOW WHO
I AM WITHOUT THAT.

18:03.683 --> 18:06.186
YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
THAT GUY EVERYONE LIKES.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.787
I KNOW, SO IF SOMEONE
DOESN'T LIKE ME,

18:07.787 --> 18:09.659
THEN I'M JUST THE GUY
PRACTICALLY EVERYONE LIKES.

18:09.659 --> 18:12.592
AND THAT'S NOT AS GOOD
AND TAKES LONGER TO SAY.

18:12.592 --> 18:16.426
TYLER, IT'S OKAY IF
ONE PERSON DOESN'T LIKE YOU.

18:16.426 --> 18:18.628
YOU MEAN LIKE HOW MY MOM
DOESN'T LIKE YOU?

18:18.628 --> 18:20.870
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO
PICK AT THAT SCAB?

18:20.870 --> 18:23.303
IT'S VERY HURTFUL.
WHY DOESN'T SHE LIKE ME?

18:23.303 --> 18:25.104
WHY, TYLER?
WHY?!

18:25.104 --> 18:27.437
IS THAT HOW I LOOK?
ALL NEEDY AND DESPERATE?

18:27.437 --> 18:30.510
UH, YEAH.
THAT'S MY POINT.

18:30.510 --> 18:33.783
THAT'S WHAT THAT WHOLE CRAZY
"WHY, TYLER? WHY?!"
THING WAS ABOUT.

18:33.783 --> 18:37.187
BUT WHILE WE'RE ON THE SUBJECT:
WHY DOESN'T SHE LIKE ME?

18:37.187 --> 18:39.589
Stan: ARE MY PAWS TOO BIG?
I KEEP MY FUR VERY SOFT.

18:39.589 --> 18:40.690
IS IT MY DOGGIE BREATH?

18:40.690 --> 18:43.293
IT CAN'T BE ANY WORSE
THAN BENNETT'S.

18:45.655 --> 18:50.300
STOP WAVING AND JUST GO!

18:51.701 --> 18:53.563
WE'RE READY
FOR OUR PLAYDATE.

18:53.563 --> 18:54.834
I HAVE AN IDEA.

18:54.834 --> 18:58.638
IF YOU WANT DARCY TO LIKE YOU,
YOU SHOULD TAKE US TO THE ZOO.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.410
AND FROZEN YOGURT.

19:00.410 --> 19:02.912
NAH, WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

19:02.912 --> 19:05.715
I REALIZED THAT ACTING ALL
DESPERATE FOR DARCY TO LIKE ME

19:05.715 --> 19:08.578
JUST MADE ME LOOK
REALLY, REALLY UNCOOL.

19:08.578 --> 19:10.220
NO!

19:10.220 --> 19:11.581
YOU HAVE TO WANT
HER TO LIKE YOU!

19:11.581 --> 19:13.483
WE WANT ZOO!

19:13.483 --> 19:15.785
AND FRO-YO.

19:15.785 --> 19:17.557
WAIT A MINUTE.

19:17.557 --> 19:19.429
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN PLAYING ME,
HAVEN'T YOU?

19:19.429 --> 19:21.631
YOU'RE PRETENDING
DARCY DOESN'T LIKE ME,

19:21.631 --> 19:23.663
SO I WOULD BABYSIT
AND DO STUFF FOR YOU.

19:23.663 --> 19:27.367
NO. HONEST.
SHE HATES YOU.

19:27.367 --> 19:28.768
DARCY, COME HERE.

19:30.340 --> 19:31.671
DO YOU HATE ME?

19:31.671 --> 19:33.273
YES.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.605
BECAUSE I THINK YOU LIKE ME.

19:35.605 --> 19:38.648
NO, I DON'T.

19:38.648 --> 19:42.412
I THINK YOU LIKE ME ALMOST
AS MUCH AS I LIKE ME.

19:45.715 --> 19:47.617
I LIKE YOU MORE!

19:47.617 --> 19:50.220
OH, THANK GOODNESS.

19:50.220 --> 19:51.691
THIS IS THE BEST
OF BOTH WORLDS.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.923
I REALIZE NOT EVERYONE
HAS TO LIKE ME,

19:53.923 --> 19:55.565
AND EVERYONE LIKES ME!

19:55.565 --> 19:58.298
HIT ME WITH A SLY BROW!
PLEASE!

19:58.298 --> 19:59.669
JUST ONE SEC.

19:59.669 --> 20:02.702
TUCKLE. SLYBROW.

20:03.673 --> 20:04.674
( sighs )

20:11.611 --> 20:14.684
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
MY KNEES FIT UNDER THIS TABLE.

20:16.686 --> 20:18.217
BENNETT, I AM SO EXCITED.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.620
I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO PARK
MY CAR IN OUR GARRIAGE.

20:20.620 --> 20:23.893
HAVE YOU BEEN CALLING THE GARAGE
THE "GARRIAGE" THIS WHOLE TIME?

20:23.893 --> 20:25.395
NO, BUT NOW THAT IT'S
ALL CLEANED OUT,

20:25.395 --> 20:26.556
I FIGURED IT NEEDS
SOME SPRUCING UP.

20:26.556 --> 20:27.997
I'M STARTING WITH THE NAME.

20:27.997 --> 20:29.729
BY MAKING ROOM
IN YOUR GARRIAGE,

20:29.729 --> 20:31.831
YOU HAVE MADE PEACE
IN YOUR MARRIAGE.

20:33.002 --> 20:34.804
JOLLY GOOD ONE, ELLEN.

20:34.804 --> 20:39.609
WELL, SEEING YOU SO HAPPY
MAKES IT ALL WORTH IT.

20:39.609 --> 20:42.912
SO WHAT'D YOU DO WITH
ALL THE "GARBAGE" THAT
WAS IN THE GARRIAGE?

20:42.912 --> 20:45.315
DON'T WORRY,
I TOOK CARE OF IT.

20:45.315 --> 20:47.647
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I HAVE A PATIENT WAITING.

20:50.550 --> 20:52.452
TOMMY?

20:52.452 --> 20:53.853
TOMMY, ARE YOU IN HERE?

20:53.853 --> 20:57.657
TOM-TOM-TOM-
WHOA!

21:01.291 --> 21:03.663
WELL, AVERY,
IF YOU WANTED
TO GET IN TROUBLE

21:03.663 --> 21:05.995
AND LOSE THAT
GOODY-GOODY IMAGE,
THIS SHOULD DO IT.

21:05.995 --> 21:09.639
( indistinct chatter )

21:11.741 --> 21:13.443
IF HE DOESN'T COME
OUT OF THERE WITH WINGS,

21:13.443 --> 21:14.704
I'M GOING TO BE
VERY DISAPPOINTED.

21:16.546 --> 21:17.807
AAH!
WHAT THE--

21:17.807 --> 21:19.749
NOW AM I IN TROUBLE,
MR. CARVER?

21:19.749 --> 21:23.953
YES! AND I EXPECT YOU TO REMOVE
ALL THIS YARN IMMEDIATELY.

21:23.953 --> 21:25.785
BUT DO ME LAST.

21:25.785 --> 21:29.359
I FEEL WARM AND SWADDLED.

21:29.359 --> 21:30.690
I DID IT!

21:30.690 --> 21:32.622
I ACTUALLY DID IT!
DID YOU HEAR THAT, EVERYBODY?

21:32.622 --> 21:35.365
I'M IN TROUBLE!
I'M A BADDY-BADDY!

21:35.365 --> 21:36.596
WHO KNOWS WHAT
I'M GONNA DO NEXT!

21:36.596 --> 21:37.797
PROBABLY CLEAN IT ALL UP,

21:37.797 --> 21:40.670
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT HE TOLD ME TO DO.

21:40.670 --> 21:43.673
WOW, AVERY, DID YOU DO THIS?

21:43.673 --> 21:45.635
YEAH. YEAH, I DID.

21:45.635 --> 21:46.806
( blows )

21:49.709 --> 21:51.411
IT'S AMAZING.

21:51.411 --> 21:53.883
ISN'T THIS AMAZING, EVERYONE?

21:53.883 --> 21:59.389
( applause )

21:59.389 --> 22:00.720
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
HAD THIS IN YOU.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.492
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS IN ME?

22:02.492 --> 22:03.693
THESE TWO KNITTING NEEDLES.

22:03.693 --> 22:05.324
I NEED TO GO TO THE NURSE.

22:08.097 --> 22:09.559
Stan:
AVERY AND TYLER BOTH WRESTLED

22:09.559 --> 22:12.802
WITH WANTING TO BE ACCEPTED
VERSUS ACCEPTING WHO THEY ARE.

22:12.802 --> 22:14.504
THAT HAPPENS A LOT.

22:14.504 --> 22:16.406
I, FOR ONE, HAVE ACCEPTED
THE FACT

22:16.406 --> 22:18.408
THAT I LIKE TO CHEW
THE LEGS OFF OF FURNITURE.

22:20.910 --> 22:24.614
SO WE'RE JUST GONNA PRETEND
THIS ISN'T HAPPENING, HUH?

22:24.614 --> 22:26.916
I REALLY DO NOT KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

22:29.949 --> 22:31.951
OKAY, MAYBE I DO
HAVE A PROBLEM.
