44:17.600 --> 44:18.567
OH, IT'S GREAT.

44:18.600 --> 44:20.467
HAVE YOU SEEN ALICE?

44:28.567 --> 44:30.467
IT'S TIME FOR YOUR
BACHELORETTE LAP DANCE.

44:30.500 --> 44:32.233
NO, NOT IN FRONT
OF MY MOTHER.

44:32.267 --> 44:33.467
WHAT ARE YOU, SILLY?

44:33.500 --> 44:35.067
LOOK.

44:42.333 --> 44:43.400
I THINK SHE'S HAVING
A GOOD TIME.

44:49.633 --> 44:50.567
CHECK IT OUT.

44:50.600 --> 44:51.600
THERE'S NINE ALTOGETHER.

44:51.633 --> 44:55.100
OH, FUCKING
AWESOME.

44:55.133 --> 44:57.300
UM, WHAT ABOUT THE REST?

44:57.333 --> 44:58.633
WHAT REST?

44:58.667 --> 44:59.900
BEDROOMS, BATHROOM--

45:00.067 --> 45:02.367
DUDE, HAVE A LITTLE
FUCKING RESPECT.

45:02.400 --> 45:03.500
THEY'RE MY ROOMMATES.

45:03.533 --> 45:05.467
JESUS.

45:08.833 --> 45:11.633
[LAUGHS]

45:11.667 --> 45:12.933
LOOK,
I DIDN'T DO BATHROOMS, MAN.

45:12.967 --> 45:14.367
THAT CROSSES A PERSONAL LINE
FOR ME, BUT, UH...

45:14.400 --> 45:17.267
WE'RE IN.

45:17.300 --> 45:18.467
SWEET, MAN.

45:29.067 --> 45:32.200
HOW LONG HAVE
YOU ALL KNOWN?

45:32.233 --> 45:34.133
NOT LONG.

45:34.167 --> 45:35.133
I MEAN, SHE WAS HIDING IT
FROM EVERYBODY.

45:35.167 --> 45:36.133
SHE PROBABLY
DIDN'T KNOW

45:36.167 --> 45:37.133
WHAT TO SAY,
BETTE.

45:38.833 --> 45:41.567
DON'T KILL
YOURSELF OVER IT.

45:41.600 --> 45:43.133
YOU KNOW, IRONICALLY,

45:43.167 --> 45:44.300
I WAS ACTUALLY PLEASED TO SEE
THAT SHE HAD PUT ON WEIGHT,

45:44.333 --> 45:45.767
BECAUSE I THOUGHT, NUMBER ONE,

45:45.800 --> 45:47.433
IT MEANS THAT IF SHE'S EATING
TO COVER HER PAIN,

45:47.467 --> 45:50.300
THAT MEANS SHE'S REALLY ACTUALLY
STILL IN LOVE WITH ME,

45:50.333 --> 45:51.433
AND TWO, IF
SHE'S OVERWEIGHT,

45:51.467 --> 45:52.533
THEN MAYBE SHE
MIGHT HAVE TROUBLE

45:52.567 --> 45:54.333
FINDING
SOMEONE ELSE,

45:54.367 --> 45:56.500
SO I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE,
EVENTUALLY, IF SHE COULD LET--

46:03.267 --> 46:05.367
[ALICE]: JESUS, MARY,
AND JOSEPH, WHO'S THAT?

46:07.633 --> 46:09.933
MAKE ME ANOTHER.
MAKE IT A DOUBLE, PLEASE.

46:09.967 --> 46:13.900
HEY, BABY SIS,
WHAT'S UP?

46:18.100 --> 46:20.067
WHO THAT?

46:20.067 --> 46:22.367
THAT'S HELENA PEABODY.

46:22.400 --> 46:26.233
I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE BROUGHT HER HERE.

46:26.267 --> 46:29.833
YOU WANT ME
TO ASK HER TO LEAVE?

46:34.800 --> 46:35.633
CONGRATULATIONS.

46:35.667 --> 46:38.167
HI!

46:38.200 --> 46:39.267
HOW ARE YOU?

46:39.300 --> 46:40.833
GOOD, GOOD.

46:40.867 --> 46:41.833
HI.

46:41.867 --> 46:43.567
HI. HELENA PEABODY.

46:43.600 --> 46:44.700
HI.

46:44.733 --> 46:45.933
THANK YOU.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

46:45.967 --> 46:48.867
DANA, TONYA, THIS
IS HELENA PEABODY.

46:48.900 --> 46:50.767
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND
MY CRASHING YOUR PARTY.

46:50.800 --> 46:54.167
AT LEAST I DIDN'T COME
EMPTY HANDED.

46:54.200 --> 46:55.567
FROM ME AND TINA.

46:55.600 --> 46:57.867
PRESENTS!

46:57.900 --> 47:01.500
[HELENA]: JUST A FEW
THINGS WE SCROUNGED UP.

47:03.067 --> 47:05.067
MM-HMM,
HERE WE GO.

47:05.067 --> 47:08.367
THE PHILLIPS SENSEO
COFFEE POT SYSTEM!

47:08.400 --> 47:11.200
OH, AND A KETTLE--

47:11.233 --> 47:13.067
WOW, THAT'S VERY,
VERY GENEROUS.

47:13.067 --> 47:15.067
OH, HELLO.

47:15.100 --> 47:16.300
HELLO.

47:16.333 --> 47:17.467
I'M AFRAID I MAY HAVE
OVERCOMPENSATED.

47:20.500 --> 47:21.833
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS

47:21.867 --> 47:23.333
WHEN YOU'RE THE UNINVITED GUEST.

47:23.367 --> 47:25.367
ACTUALLY, I'VE NEVER BEEN
THE UNINVITED GUEST.

47:25.400 --> 47:28.067
I ALWAYS PREFER NOT TO GO
WHERE I'M NOT WANTED.

47:28.067 --> 47:32.400
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
HELENA'S NOT WANTED?

47:43.533 --> 47:46.467
INITIAL OBSERVATIONS
AND THEORIES.

47:46.500 --> 47:48.100
[CLEARS THROAT]

47:48.133 --> 47:52.067
THESE GIRLS TALK
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

47:52.100 --> 47:53.633
NOW, I DON'T KNOW

47:53.667 --> 47:55.967
IF THAT'S, LIKE, STRICTLY
A LESBIAN THING OR WHAT,

47:56.067 --> 47:58.967
BUT MAN, THESE GIRLS ARE ALL UP
IN ONE ANOTHER'S BUSINESS.

47:59.067 --> 48:00.133
NOW, DON'T GET ME WRONG.

48:00.167 --> 48:01.800
I MEAN,
I THINK THE TALK'S GREAT.

48:01.833 --> 48:03.500
I'M LOVING THE TALK, BUT, UH,

48:03.533 --> 48:05.067
I'VE GOT TO ADMIT

48:05.067 --> 48:06.533
I'M HOPING SOON
WE'RE GOING TO GET TO PARTAKE

48:06.567 --> 48:07.900
IN A LITTLE, UH, ACTION.

48:11.433 --> 48:14.967
[***]

48:27.767 --> 48:30.833
ALICE, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE IGNORING US.

48:30.867 --> 48:32.900
NO, I... YOU KNOW...

48:32.933 --> 48:34.933
EVERYBODY!

48:34.967 --> 48:35.933
HI!

48:35.967 --> 48:40.600
EVERYBODY,
THIS IS...

48:40.633 --> 48:42.800
DANA'S BEST FRIEND,

A LONG TIME,

49:07.467 --> 49:10.600
AND, UM,

49:10.633 --> 49:13.500
I GUESS, LIKE
MOST THINGS

49:13.533 --> 49:15.567
THAT ARE RIGHT IN FRONT
OF YOUR EYES,

49:15.600 --> 49:18.133
YOU DON'T SEE
JUST HOW WONDERFUL THEY ARE

49:18.167 --> 49:20.867
UNTIL THEY'RE GONE.

49:20.900 --> 49:24.733

TONYA...

49:25.967 --> 49:29.867
UM...

49:29.900 --> 49:36.333
YOU ARE THE LUCKIEST
WOMAN ON EARTH.

49:36.367 --> 49:41.500
TO MY FRIEND...

49:41.533 --> 49:43.367
WHAT CAN I SAY.

49:43.400 --> 49:46.067
UM...

49:46.067 --> 49:50.067
CONGRATULATIONS.

49:55.067 --> 49:58.233
I LOVE YOU, SO...

50:01.067 --> 50:02.733
OKAY.

[APPLAUSE]

50:11.200 --> 50:14.567
[***]

50:58.600 --> 51:00.167
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE LEAVE,

51:00.200 --> 51:02.067
QUIT TORTURING
OURSELVES?

51:05.467 --> 51:07.933
JUST SOMETHING
I HAVE TO DO.

51:21.400 --> 51:25.133
[CLINKING GLASS]

51:32.533 --> 51:36.567
DANA, TONYA...

51:36.600 --> 51:39.300
I LIFT MY GLASS

51:39.333 --> 51:44.467
TO CARING AND KINDNESS

ISN'T POSSIBLE,
