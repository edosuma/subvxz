[narrator] <i>Previously on </i> Dynasty:

00:13.638 --> 00:16.850
When you walk out,
Blake will see he's not invincible.

00:16.933 --> 00:19.310
-Cecil tried to kill me.
-What?

00:19.394 --> 00:21.896
The man was crazy.
Who knows what he'd do?

00:21.980 --> 00:24.858
Blake Carrington sent my father to prison.

00:24.941 --> 00:27.318
He's been pulling strings
to keep him there.

00:27.402 --> 00:31.364
The commissioner overruled that decision.
Cecil Colby's being released.

00:31.448 --> 00:33.366
-Jeff's playing me.
-Monica, too.

00:33.450 --> 00:35.577
[Fallon] Jeff Colby is going down.

00:35.660 --> 00:36.870
I can keep a secret.

00:38.621 --> 00:41.708
My life may be over,
but I am not going down alone.

00:41.791 --> 00:44.085
I'm taking you and Steven down with me.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.112
You don't know? You were with him!

01:11.196 --> 01:12.906
The guy is crazy, Steven. -Was crazy.
-I'm calling 911.

01:18.119 --> 01:21.456
Maybe someone already did?
I can't talk to the police.

01:21.539 --> 01:24.209
-Why not? You didn't do anything wrong.
-That's not what it looks like.

01:24.292 --> 01:26.711
He ripped my earring out
and took it with him.

01:26.795 --> 01:28.922
He was trying to frame me for his murder.

01:29.881 --> 01:34.636
Okay. Well, as screwed up as that is,
just tell the police what happened.

01:34.719 --> 01:37.806
For some reason they believe me?
I'm still screwed.

01:37.889 --> 01:42.060
I'm not here legally, Steven.
My papers are not valid anymore.

01:42.143 --> 01:45.939
Really? Just get back to the manor
before anyone else sees you.

01:46.022 --> 01:48.983
You were never here, okay?
I'll handle it, just go.

01:53.279 --> 01:54.989
[Fallon] Okay, let's back it up.

01:55.448 --> 01:58.284
Why on earth would Jeff want
to marry me so badly

01:58.368 --> 02:00.411
that he'd have Monica manipulate me?

02:00.495 --> 02:04.874
-Marriage is the ultimate merger.
-Carringtons don't marry without a prenup.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.085
Maybe this is to spite your father.

02:07.627 --> 02:10.547
When you wanted to leave,
Jeff was quick to back you.

02:10.630 --> 02:13.341
And smug every chance he got to rub it in.

02:13.424 --> 02:17.345
As smug as you are now? You're loving
that you were right about Jeff.

02:17.428 --> 02:20.849
I don't mind it.
I do mind you wearing his ring, though.

02:20.932 --> 02:24.561
I had to make him believe
that I was into him, not onto him.

02:24.644 --> 02:29.149
The closer I stay, better chance I have
of figuring out what the hell's going on.

02:29.566 --> 02:33.444
I mean, what if he's been using me
this whole time?

02:33.528 --> 02:34.487
And I let him.

02:35.029 --> 02:38.616
This is exactly why I don't trust people.
But he was always so...

02:41.911 --> 02:43.663
Oh, my God.
-[Jeff] I trust you.

02:43.746 --> 02:45.832
Even if you don't trust me.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.376
Remember that program Jeff gave me

02:48.459 --> 02:52.839
when we were trying to erase Cristal's
affair? Told me to run it on the server.

02:52.922 --> 02:56.551
-And you said it worked.
-It did. But what if it gave him access?

02:56.968 --> 03:00.638
I always wondered how he knew so much
about the Venezuela deal.

03:00.722 --> 03:04.851
I mean, what if he's been reading
all of our e-mails, all of our texts?

03:10.064 --> 03:12.609
-What are you doing?
-I'm testing my theory.

03:12.692 --> 03:15.778
I'm going to write you an e-mail
professing my undying love for Jeff.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.488
Can't wait to read that one.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.741
I'm gonna say how happy I am
you and I didn't work out,

03:19.824 --> 03:21.701
so I didn't have to get married
in a church.

03:21.784 --> 03:24.120
-Priests make me break out in hives.
-Is that true?

03:24.203 --> 03:27.957
It's bait.
And we're gonna see if Jeff takes it.

03:30.460 --> 03:31.836
[Jeff] Welcome home, Dad.

03:33.963 --> 03:37.800
-Your boy did pretty good, right?
-Whenever I was having a bad day

03:37.884 --> 03:42.180
in prison, I'd try to picture this place
the way you described it.

03:43.598 --> 03:46.768
But this is better
than anything I could've imagined.

03:46.851 --> 03:50.772
So, I set it to the property lines.
Rules are here if you forget them.

03:50.855 --> 03:53.566
-But I wouldn't forget them.
-Thank you, officer.

03:55.777 --> 03:59.113
Well... this beats the hell
out of my last prison.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.449
This is paradise.

04:01.532 --> 04:04.535
Long way from that Lakewood Heights shack
we lived in.

04:04.619 --> 04:10.041
But it's a proud day when a son
outstrips his father's wildest dreams.

04:11.584 --> 04:14.587
You'll be even prouder
when you see my plan at work.

04:14.671 --> 04:19.216
You know, I had my doubts about your
methods, but you did make me a free man.

04:19.300 --> 04:21.594
Well, mostly. [chuckles]

04:23.805 --> 04:25.515
[in foreign language]
When you're in paradise...

04:26.099 --> 04:27.767
Why leave it?

04:30.061 --> 04:32.272
[in English] Today,
we celebrate the Colbys.

04:33.022 --> 04:34.440
Reunited at last.

04:37.402 --> 04:38.319
[cell phone ringing]

04:38.945 --> 04:40.863
Blake. Where are you?

04:40.947 --> 04:44.117
I don't want you to worry,
but I met with our security team.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.244
<i>Cecil Colby's out on parole.</i>

04:46.327 --> 04:49.998
You don't think he'd still want revenge
after 11 years, do you?

04:50.081 --> 04:52.792
Wanted you to know
there'll be extra security.

04:52.875 --> 04:56.379
-No need to worry about anything.
-Blake, you didn't.

04:56.462 --> 04:57.297
Didn't what?

04:58.339 --> 05:02.719
You know I love white hyacinths.
That's so sweet of you to think of me--

05:07.140 --> 05:08.683
Well, those aren't from me.

05:08.766 --> 05:11.477
Oh! They're from Ramona.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.479
From the <i>Atlanta Digest.</i>

05:13.563 --> 05:17.025
Gave her a tip for the story she's doing
on C.A.'s experiment.

05:17.108 --> 05:20.236
Nice arrangement.
You didn't give her the whole story?

05:20.320 --> 05:21.696
No. Just the tip.

05:22.488 --> 05:24.198
Listen, I should get to work.

05:24.282 --> 05:25.408
<i>Okay. Bye, honey.</i>

05:28.453 --> 05:30.079
I'm so sorry for your loss.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.539
Feel free to call your lawyer.

05:31.622 --> 05:34.417
No, that's okay, I've got nothing to hide.

05:36.377 --> 05:39.088
He was by the window,
and I turned my back.

05:39.172 --> 05:43.051
So, I don't know if he lost his balance
or jumped, or...

05:43.676 --> 05:47.638
Hey! This man still has a pulse!
Take this. Let's go!

05:48.222 --> 05:50.391
[officer] Your friend might make it.

06:00.318 --> 06:01.694
[knocking on door] What were you thinking?

06:08.326 --> 06:11.662
-Sending flowers to my office?
-It was the gentlemanly thing to do.

06:11.746 --> 06:13.539
Kissing a married woman
is not gentlemanly.

06:13.623 --> 06:18.461
-You kissed me.
-Whatever happened, it was a mistake.

06:18.544 --> 06:20.671
-It can't happen again.
-That all you have to say?

06:20.755 --> 06:22.965
-What did you expect to hear?
-Something like:

06:23.049 --> 06:26.552
"We shouldn't have done that, Rick,
but you know I'm impulsive.

06:26.636 --> 06:29.764
-And I love that you're impulsive, too."
-I love my husband.

06:29.847 --> 06:33.059
You love your freedom. You're afraid
you were wrong to give that up.

06:33.142 --> 06:36.562
-I'm not afraid of anything.
-Then why are you trembling?

06:39.107 --> 06:42.110
We have to stay away from each other.

06:42.193 --> 06:43.945
[phone ringing]

06:51.244 --> 06:53.162
Always causing trouble, aren't you?

06:53.996 --> 06:54.831
Me?

06:55.665 --> 06:56.541
What did I do?

06:56.624 --> 06:59.669
Well, you nearly caused an accident
in the parking lot.

07:00.211 --> 07:03.297
The valet said he was blinded
by the bling on my finger.

07:03.381 --> 07:07.051
Go big or kill somebody trying.
That's the Carrington way, right?

07:07.135 --> 07:09.971
You sure do know a lot about my family.

07:11.013 --> 07:12.265
Speaking of family...

07:12.348 --> 07:14.475
You heard my father got out on parole?

07:14.559 --> 07:15.518
Mm-hm.

07:15.601 --> 07:18.896
I know, it's all over the Internet.
He's staying with me.

07:19.397 --> 07:22.108
I thought we could all have dinner
tomorrow.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.110
Introduce him to my fiancée.

07:24.193 --> 07:26.487
Well, I've already met your Dad.

07:26.904 --> 07:28.030
In prison.

07:28.114 --> 07:31.659
-He has quite the temper.
-Yeah. That was a misunderstanding.

07:31.742 --> 07:36.080
Hates your dad for putting me through
that lawsuit and trying to take my tech.

07:36.164 --> 07:39.750
Don't worry, I'll tell him
to use his inside voice this time.

07:40.793 --> 07:42.170
So, about Blake...

07:43.129 --> 07:47.049
what did he say? Or did you not tell him
about our engagement?

07:47.133 --> 07:49.510
We both know that isn't going to go well.

07:49.594 --> 07:53.055
Anders would start
making us discuss reception venues,

07:53.139 --> 07:55.308
book a church, meet with planners.

07:55.391 --> 07:56.684
Too much, too soon.

07:56.851 --> 08:00.229
I can't see Fallon Carrington
getting married in a church.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.857
Not without burning it down.

08:04.525 --> 08:06.527
I mean, I'll do whatever you want.

08:06.611 --> 08:09.238
No, I'm impressed.

08:10.239 --> 08:11.699
You know me so well.

08:13.576 --> 08:16.746
-What did you say?
-Nothing that wouldn't have made sense

08:16.829 --> 08:20.750
if Ted had simply stuck to his plan
and died. I had to think quick.

08:20.833 --> 08:24.587
I knew what Sam told me, that Ted
wanted it to look like Sam pushed him.

08:24.670 --> 08:27.673
-Sam didn't push him?
-No. Sam didn't do anything.

08:28.174 --> 08:31.719
Ted might have Sam's blood on him.
I couldn't find the earring.

08:31.802 --> 08:36.097
Plus, if Ted wakes up from the coma,
this is gonna look worse because I lied.

08:36.182 --> 08:40.436
That can't happen. You have to get
into his room before anyone else does.

08:41.145 --> 08:43.731
-Dad.
-To wipe off the blood. Not kill him.

08:44.357 --> 08:47.276
The nurse won't let in
anyone who's not family.

08:50.613 --> 08:51.447
[buzzing]

08:51.531 --> 08:52.657
What are you doing?

08:55.117 --> 08:58.663
Because you're a same-sex partner,
you're not considered family?

08:58.746 --> 09:01.791
Sir, keep your voice down,
or you'll be asked to leave.

09:01.874 --> 09:06.587
What is this, 1952? My son can't comfort
a dying man, the love of his life,

09:06.671 --> 09:08.673
because of his sexual orientation?

09:08.756 --> 09:12.426
This is inexcusable, not to mention
disrespectful to all the gays,

09:12.510 --> 09:14.512
-the LTBZ community!
-Close enough.

09:14.595 --> 09:18.307
Sir, I didn't know he was
Mr. Dinard's partner. He didn't mention--

09:18.391 --> 09:21.477
Or you weren't listening,
because he's gay.

09:24.146 --> 09:25.231
Follow me.

09:25.690 --> 09:27.650
And I'll waive visiting hours.

09:34.490 --> 09:36.909
-He took the bait.
-So, he is spying on you? That's illegal, we go to the police.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.416
-His cousin is chief of police.
-Start with your dad.

09:43.499 --> 09:46.043
No. No, if anybody's gonna nail Jeff,
it'll be me.

09:46.127 --> 09:50.256
Blake has resources. We don't know
what type of blackmail Jeff may have.

09:50.339 --> 09:52.883
Think I don't know that?
This is all my fault.

09:52.967 --> 09:56.304
My dad warned me not to get involved
with Jeff, and I didn't listen.

09:56.387 --> 09:59.098
Instead, I helped his enemy
plant spyware in our house.

09:59.181 --> 10:00.558
You didn't know.

10:00.641 --> 10:04.061
That doesn't matter.
My dad once blamed me for losing a deal

10:04.145 --> 10:07.231
because he got stuck in traffic
on the way back from my recital.

10:07.690 --> 10:10.860
-He'll never respect me again.
-So, then we keep it between us.

10:11.986 --> 10:14.071
We need to find out what Jeff knows.

10:14.155 --> 10:16.657
Ironically,
the only IT genius I know is Jeff.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.743
I may know someone who can help us out.

10:21.203 --> 10:24.582
-The nurses cleaned him?
-To avoid any possible infections.

10:24.665 --> 10:26.125
Said it's basic procedure.

10:26.208 --> 10:28.836
-The earring?
-Somewhere in the alley, I assume.

10:28.919 --> 10:32.214
There's no reason
for anyone to know it ever existed.

10:32.298 --> 10:36.927
-[Blake] We need to find that earring.
-Mr. Carrington, tell us about Mr. Dinard.

10:37.011 --> 10:40.056
-Partner's gonna make it?
-How do they know we're here?

10:40.139 --> 10:41.265
These things leak. You leaked this.

10:43.351 --> 10:44.602
[reporters clamoring]

10:46.187 --> 10:48.731
Nurse Ratched turned
into Florence Nightingale

10:48.814 --> 10:52.068
at you being a grieving partner.
She ate that story up.

10:52.902 --> 10:55.738
You are a public figure
running for city council.

10:56.280 --> 10:59.617
We garner public sympathy
and spin the story in our favor,

10:59.700 --> 11:02.328
no one even thinks to ask about Sam.

11:02.411 --> 11:05.539
Except the whole world thinks
I'm dating Ted Dinard.

11:05.623 --> 11:09.835
Well, that seems like a small price to pay
for your future. And Sam's.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.047
Okay. Fine.

11:14.965 --> 11:18.552
I would like to ask
for everyone's respect at this time.

11:18.636 --> 11:21.472
My son is going through
a traumatic event, and--

11:21.555 --> 11:24.642
And I can only take a few questions
right now.

11:24.725 --> 11:26.560
Do you plan on suspending your campaign?

11:26.644 --> 11:30.898
My priority now is the health
and well-being of my partner, Ted Dinard.

11:30.981 --> 11:33.484
So, you're suspending it
to be with your partner?

11:33.567 --> 11:37.446
I can't answer that right now.
Not during such an emotional moment.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.574
Politics should never come
before human compassion.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.583
<i>...health and well-being of my partner.</i>

11:49.667 --> 11:51.752
-[Cristal] Partner?
-[Sam] That's one way to put it.

11:52.378 --> 11:57.299
Well, someone's developed a case
of post-traumatic stress eating disorder.

11:57.466 --> 12:01.262
Hard to have an appetite
when you might be dragged away in cuffs.

12:01.429 --> 12:03.222
I wouldn't last a day in prison.

12:03.305 --> 12:06.016
This face has "Make Me Your Bitch"
all over it.

12:06.100 --> 12:10.813
Hey, Blake is handling it. All you need
to do is lay low and stay out of trouble.

12:10.896 --> 12:14.775
Yeah, that's the problem, it always
finds me, ever since I moved here.

12:14.859 --> 12:18.779
The robbery that almost killed Blake,
my parents kidnapping Fallon,

12:18.946 --> 12:23.159
and now the tragic triangle with Ted.
Really, I'm the trouble, aren't I?

12:23.242 --> 12:26.036
Well, you do come
with a 747's worth of baggage.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.705
-[Cristal] Anders.
-What?

12:28.372 --> 12:29.206
He asked.

12:32.126 --> 12:34.128
You and I are the same, Sam.

12:34.211 --> 12:36.964
We left Venezuela
in search of something better,

12:37.047 --> 12:39.550
you with fake papers, me with stolen ones.

12:39.633 --> 12:43.846
Worked our asses off in a country
where cards seem to be stacked against us.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.347
You worked your ass off.

12:45.431 --> 12:49.643
I took a sketchier path, paved
by the kindness I stole from strangers.

12:49.727 --> 12:53.272
This isn't stealing. This is what people
who love each other do.

12:53.355 --> 12:56.358
I don't want them to do it for me.
I don't deserve it.

12:57.359 --> 13:00.905
And I especially don't want
to be a strain on your marriage.

13:00.988 --> 13:05.034
Trust me, there are bigger strains
on my marriage than you.

13:05.117 --> 13:06.452
[knocking on door]

13:06.535 --> 13:08.454
-Am I interrupting?
-[Cristal] Not at all.

13:09.079 --> 13:10.039
He's all yours. How you feeling?

13:17.463 --> 13:21.175
Well, I mean, you are pretending
to be lovers with a dying man

13:21.258 --> 13:25.679
after he tried to frame me for his murder.
It's not your typical Wednesday.

13:26.430 --> 13:28.265
How's your Ted-inflicted wound?

13:28.349 --> 13:29.183
Mm.

13:29.266 --> 13:34.939
It's fine. Honestly, what hurts is that
my grandmother gave me that earring,

13:35.022 --> 13:39.610
when I was leaving Venezuela. She said it
was a way for God to be looking after me.

13:39.693 --> 13:44.198
Well, maybe losing it is God's way
of saying you don't need it anymore.

13:44.865 --> 13:46.825
You've got me to protect you now.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.168
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

13:58.754 --> 14:01.257
Why did we stop seeing each other, anyway?

14:02.383 --> 14:03.884
Because I slept with Ted.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.053
[both chuckle]

14:06.428 --> 14:07.263
Yeah.

14:07.763 --> 14:11.600
We all make mistakes, I guess.
Doesn't mean we should stop trying.

14:13.894 --> 14:15.187
[cell phone rings]

14:16.146 --> 14:18.691
<i>Atlanta Mirror</i> wants
a follow-up interview.

14:18.983 --> 14:23.153
Outlets are asking me to comment
on health benefits for same-sex couples.

14:23.779 --> 14:25.447
What has my father started?

14:26.490 --> 14:27.533
Can we talk later?

14:43.132 --> 14:46.260
Hey, spare no expense.
My dad deserves the best.

14:46.468 --> 14:47.636
So does my son.

14:48.429 --> 14:51.515
You know, I like this.
You know good quality.

14:52.558 --> 14:56.979
If we're choosing for the wedding,
stick with navy. Blake prefers gray.

14:59.356 --> 15:03.527
Navy, then. And I'll be the father
shackled by the ankle bracelet.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.279
That'll be off soon.

15:05.362 --> 15:08.866
The important thing
is my dad gets to be at my wedding.

15:09.408 --> 15:10.826
It's not a real wedding.

15:11.827 --> 15:14.288
You're marrying a godforsaken Carrington.

15:16.999 --> 15:18.083
Uh...

15:18.500 --> 15:21.045
Go buy yourself
some needle and thread, huh?

15:21.754 --> 15:22.588
Thank you.

15:25.132 --> 15:27.718
Not usually the father of the groom
that gets cold feet.

15:27.801 --> 15:31.513
You don't know who you're dealing with.
I faced Blake. And lost.

15:32.389 --> 15:35.184
I've been facing him for years,
and winning.

15:35.267 --> 15:38.562
First my lawsuit, then his daughter,
next his company.

15:38.646 --> 15:41.106
I control everything, including Fallon.

15:41.357 --> 15:44.860
You'll see when she comes for dinner
tomorrow. She dies for me.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.738
I've no interest in dining
with the devil's spawn.

15:47.821 --> 15:52.159
Get interested. You need to apologize
for losing your cool when you first met.

15:52.242 --> 15:55.120
-Why the hell will I apologize?
-Because I said so.

15:56.455 --> 15:59.917
I know when you left
I was just some confused, naive kid.

16:00.209 --> 16:01.460
But this is my house.

16:02.419 --> 16:05.839
You play your part in it,
and everything will be just fine.

16:17.643 --> 16:18.477
Found it!

16:20.771 --> 16:22.982
Nice to meet you. You're adorable.

16:23.565 --> 16:26.443
I don't wanna cry nepotism,
but you sure your sister

16:26.527 --> 16:30.114
-can crack Jeff Colby's spyware?
-I'm a senior at Emory.

16:30.197 --> 16:33.826
My thesis project is developing software
for advanced robotics.

16:33.909 --> 16:36.370
-What were you doing at that age?
-Robby Reid.

16:36.453 --> 16:39.248
Whoever programmed the virus
found a way to duplicate your e-mails

16:39.331 --> 16:42.334
and send them to, wow,
17 different IP addresses.

16:42.418 --> 16:44.753
-What does that mean?
-I don't know yet.

16:46.213 --> 16:51.093
So, the other day,
I uttered the four-letter L-word,

16:51.176 --> 16:53.637
and you kind of just L-E-F-T.

16:53.721 --> 16:57.224
I had to go deal with Monica.
And did you? Did you dump her?

16:57.307 --> 17:00.144
I thought keeping her around
could be helpful.

17:00.227 --> 17:01.645
-But you're not--
-No.

17:01.729 --> 17:05.023
Been trying to avoid her
for the last couple of days.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.983
-Are you and Jeff--?
-God, no.

17:07.067 --> 17:09.653
Told him I was saving it
for our wedding night.

17:10.279 --> 17:12.531
If you two are done being gross,

17:12.614 --> 17:15.867
looks like the most consistent downloads
are to this IP.

17:15.951 --> 17:18.871
-Nancy Creek.
-It's probably his private server.

17:18.954 --> 17:22.540
-[Culhane] Thanks, Evie, I owe you one.
-You owe me one Benjamin.

17:22.624 --> 17:27.253
Your girl can afford it. Or else I'll have
to tell Mom and Dad you're a chauffeur.

17:28.672 --> 17:32.885
-You should send me your résumé.
-No. You're gonna work for me one day.

17:35.429 --> 17:37.765
[Culhane] So, to erase
what Jeff has on your family,

17:37.848 --> 17:41.852
we need to destroy his laptop, his phone,
and find the private server.

17:41.935 --> 17:46.815
One step at a time. First, we need to know
where he keeps it. And in an unfortunate

17:46.899 --> 17:50.152
yet fortunate turn of events,
I'm having dinner at Jeff's.

17:50.235 --> 17:52.738
To meet his father.
Monica invited me, too.

17:53.238 --> 17:56.075
I can help create a distraction
so you can snoop.

18:00.204 --> 18:01.538
Why are you here?

18:01.663 --> 18:04.458
-Well, your butler asked me to wait.
-Hey, Rick.

18:05.125 --> 18:08.170
Steven. Thank you for agreeing
to a follow-up interview,

18:08.253 --> 18:12.174
especially during such a difficult time.
A human-interest story.

18:12.257 --> 18:15.385
People wanna know more
about your partner. Or husband?

18:15.469 --> 18:18.514
Ted wasn't able to make an honest man
out of Steven.

18:18.597 --> 18:19.431
Not yet.

18:20.390 --> 18:22.768
Maybe not ever. Terrible situation.

18:24.019 --> 18:25.020
Blake Carrington.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.980
Nice to shake the hand of the man

18:27.064 --> 18:30.734
-smart enough to marry Cristal Flores.
-It's Carrington now.

18:31.276 --> 18:34.446
Nice to meet the man who's done
so much for my son's campaign.

18:34.530 --> 18:35.614
Your interview went over well.

18:36.406 --> 18:39.701
When you're done, why don't you
join Cristal and me for dinner?

18:39.785 --> 18:42.121
Steven will have to get back
to Ted's side.

18:43.455 --> 18:45.124
That would be fantastic.

18:58.178 --> 18:59.096
Mr. Dinard.

19:00.222 --> 19:01.890
Steven Carrington.

19:05.269 --> 19:07.521
What the hell happened to my son?

19:14.111 --> 19:17.614
I know this is a lot to take in,
but I cared about your son.

19:17.698 --> 19:19.950
Cared? My son is still alive.

19:20.826 --> 19:24.788
Only time he ever mentioned your name
was when he was defending you,

19:25.289 --> 19:28.292
the person that drove him away from me.

19:29.084 --> 19:30.127
Away from the church.

19:30.210 --> 19:32.462
And when he finally reached out again,

19:32.546 --> 19:36.508
it was to tell me that it was you
that left him rotting in jail.

19:36.592 --> 19:38.635
No, sir, I bailed him out. He--

19:39.178 --> 19:42.598
Ted and I had our ups and downs,
like any other couple. But...

19:43.098 --> 19:46.268
-we were trying to make it work.
-I've been through war.

19:46.894 --> 19:49.646
Much tougher men have tried to lie to me.

19:49.897 --> 19:51.398
I know what you're doing.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.609
Taking my son's situation

19:53.692 --> 19:58.155
and milking the public for sympathy
with your press conference. Listen to me.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.033
God already knows your sins,

20:01.366 --> 20:02.367
but as for me,

20:02.784 --> 20:05.579
I will do everything in my power
to expose them,

20:05.662 --> 20:08.290
to the police and to the press.

20:08.373 --> 20:10.667
Now get out of my son's room!

20:11.585 --> 20:12.711
Mr. Dinard.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.966
We have your son's belongings.

20:20.677 --> 20:21.511
Thank you.

20:24.640 --> 20:28.435
He's been talking about meeting you
all day. He's very excited.

20:28.685 --> 20:33.398
Well, I'm excited for our rematch. Think
I'll need protective headgear this time?

20:33.482 --> 20:36.610
He'd been in prison for 11 years
when he met you.

20:36.693 --> 20:38.654
He's happy for us, trust me.

20:39.696 --> 20:40.697
[sighs]

20:40.781 --> 20:45.285
Cecil. Mr. Colby. Or should I
call you Dad? It's probably too soon.

20:45.369 --> 20:48.413
Fallon. We meet again,
under better circumstances.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.793
I apologize for my behavior
the last time we met.

20:52.876 --> 20:56.546
Oh, no worries. I can only imagine
what years of tiny televisions,

20:56.630 --> 21:00.968
toilet wine and bologna sandwiches can do.
I watched <i>Locked Up Abroad.</i>

21:01.051 --> 21:04.680
Well, at the time, I only knew you
as the daughter of the man

21:04.763 --> 21:08.183
-that tried to steal my son's invention.
-[Fallon] Don't worry.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.978
I'm used to being considered a D-bag
by relation.

21:11.061 --> 21:15.524
It's funny, my dad always claimed
that Jeff tried to steal tech from him.

21:15.607 --> 21:19.319
But why would he wanna steal anything?
My fiancé is a genius.

21:24.908 --> 21:27.953
-And you're a genius, too. Thank you.
-I got your back.

21:28.036 --> 21:29.871
Keep an eye out for my signal.

21:31.081 --> 21:32.082
Dinner's ready.

21:32.749 --> 21:33.709
Shall we?

22:05.866 --> 22:08.577
Excuse me, doctor.
How much do you want for your earrings?

22:18.503 --> 22:20.255
[Fallon] So, tell me, Mr. Colby,

22:20.964 --> 22:23.675
what were you doing
before your, you know...?

22:24.176 --> 22:25.719
-Incarceration?
-Yeah.

22:25.802 --> 22:28.221
Before that, I was working in a chem lab.

22:28.305 --> 22:32.017
Didn't pay much, but I had a gift
for making things out of nothing.

22:32.517 --> 22:33.727
Like my son.

22:35.687 --> 22:39.274
Michael, Monica tells me
you drive for the Carringtons.

22:39.357 --> 22:43.987
-Culhane is much more to us than a driver.
-His last name's practically Carrington.

22:44.071 --> 22:45.155
Well, look at that.

22:45.238 --> 22:48.325
Sure seems like the Colbys
can't resist the Carringtons, huh? Feeling is mutual.
Your daughter is an amazing woman,

22:52.120 --> 22:54.331
and I'm glad to get to meet her father.

22:54.414 --> 22:56.875
I look forward
to meeting Mrs. Colby one day.

22:58.794 --> 23:02.172
Too bad Mrs. Colby left me
when I ended up in the slammer.

23:03.507 --> 23:04.841
[clears throat]

23:05.717 --> 23:09.554
Jeff and I agreed to a fall wedding,
which is a mere six months away.

23:09.638 --> 23:13.809
If we plan on rivaling George and Amal's
opus, we should start planning.

23:13.892 --> 23:16.561
Don't tell me you're turning
into bridezilla already.

23:21.775 --> 23:24.194
-Do we need to get that resized?
-No.

23:24.402 --> 23:26.446
No. I prefer it a little loose.

23:26.530 --> 23:27.906
[Monica] Just like you.

23:27.989 --> 23:29.574
-Well, not anymore.
-Yes.

23:30.283 --> 23:31.493
Oh, my God!

23:31.576 --> 23:34.246
Culhane! This is silk velvet!

23:34.329 --> 23:37.374
Some poor worker went blind
hand-sewing these feathers.

23:37.457 --> 23:40.168
I have to get this cleaned up
before it's ruined.

23:45.132 --> 23:46.466
Charming.

23:47.926 --> 23:51.555
[Rick] There's an art to covering
politics, and the <i>Mirror</i> gets that.

23:52.180 --> 23:55.517
-Great newspaper.
-Part of the reason I'm there is Cristal.

23:55.600 --> 23:58.145
I pointed you
in the right direction, but...

23:58.228 --> 24:00.647
Your wife's a modest
and incredible woman.

24:02.190 --> 24:06.027
I would have done the same
for any other colleague with potential.

24:06.820 --> 24:10.532
Well, generosity, it's the Carrington way.

24:10.782 --> 24:14.828
In fact, why don't I float your name
for a contributor gig at CNN?

24:14.953 --> 24:19.124
Didn't they just fire one of their people
for inappropriate conduct?

24:19.207 --> 24:22.043
Honey, Rick's a journalist,
not a TV personality.

24:22.127 --> 24:23.962
He's handsome enough to be one.

24:25.213 --> 24:28.258
Apparently all he needs to do
is keep it in his pants.

24:28.341 --> 24:29.759
[Rick chuckles]

24:29.843 --> 24:33.930
You just let me know, Rick. I owe you.
Not just for the Steven interviews,

24:34.014 --> 24:37.475
but for squashing
the Senator Daniels bribery story.

24:38.101 --> 24:41.188
I hope that my wife did a proper job
of thanking you.

24:58.163 --> 24:59.623
[Jeff] What are you doing?

25:00.332 --> 25:03.376
I was just looking for your laundry room.

25:03.835 --> 25:07.214
-But I barely know what one looks like.
-That's a closet.

25:07.297 --> 25:08.215
Ah!

25:08.298 --> 25:11.301
What do you think?
You think it needs stain remover?

25:11.384 --> 25:13.595
Silk velvet? Already a goner.

25:13.929 --> 25:17.140
But I'll buy you three more
if you'll come back to dinner.

25:18.850 --> 25:21.144
You really are too good to be true.

25:35.867 --> 25:37.202
[shudders]

25:46.419 --> 25:48.213
Holy hell!

25:51.216 --> 25:52.425
[knocking on door]

25:54.844 --> 25:59.140
I just came to say that I'm sorry,
for everything you're going through.

25:59.557 --> 26:01.268
My prayers are with you and--

26:02.185 --> 26:03.019
Is that...?

26:05.814 --> 26:09.317
Oh, my God.
I can't believe Ted held onto this.

26:09.401 --> 26:10.735
What you talking about?

26:10.819 --> 26:14.489
I get why your son didn't tell you
about us, given our history.

26:15.490 --> 26:20.578
But I want you to know that his recovery
has always been my priority.

26:21.121 --> 26:24.541
I pushed him to go back to church,
to rebuild his faith, not just in God, but in himself.

26:29.004 --> 26:32.132
I gave him my cross earring

26:32.215 --> 26:36.803
as a symbol that someone
would always be watching over him...

26:37.637 --> 26:39.222
even when I couldn't.

26:43.893 --> 26:44.728
You...

26:46.062 --> 26:48.732
You helped my boy find God again?

26:49.607 --> 26:51.526
He helped me, too, Gerry.

26:53.820 --> 26:55.363
The key to recovery...

26:57.073 --> 26:58.783
is faith in a higher power.

27:04.247 --> 27:05.999
Would you pray with me?

27:14.466 --> 27:15.592
[groans]

27:17.719 --> 27:18.720
Dad?

27:20.305 --> 27:21.598
Steven?

27:27.854 --> 27:30.065
-I don't--
-It's all right.

27:30.357 --> 27:32.817
-Sam.
-His vitals are stabilizing,

27:32.901 --> 27:34.527
but based on his MRI,

27:34.611 --> 27:37.864
after severe brain trauma like his
in the temporal lobe,

27:38.323 --> 27:42.369
it may be a while before he makes sense
of his thoughts, if ever.

27:44.788 --> 27:46.247
Sammy Jo...?

27:48.208 --> 27:51.378
Son, what are you trying to say?

27:53.213 --> 27:54.047
Steven.

27:54.422 --> 27:57.008
Listen to me, Ted.
You had a terrible fall.

27:57.842 --> 28:00.929
You came to me, and you were high, again.

28:01.304 --> 28:03.807
You weren't yourself, but you're okay now.

28:03.890 --> 28:06.142
-Just tell me you understand that.
-No.

28:08.019 --> 28:09.020
Not you.

28:10.313 --> 28:12.107
[Gerry] Son, listen to him.

28:12.190 --> 28:16.236
Steven's been right here,
every second, right beside you.

28:16.319 --> 28:17.987
He truly cares for you.

28:21.991 --> 28:26.287
And I care enough to know
that this moment can't be about me.

28:26.955 --> 28:28.957
What's happened here is a miracle.

28:30.333 --> 28:34.254
This is Ted's second chance at life.
Your second chance to reconnect.

28:34.337 --> 28:35.672
I'll stay in touch.

28:36.631 --> 28:40.593
But right now... he needs his father.

28:55.150 --> 28:57.110
Thank you, Steven.

28:58.611 --> 28:59.863
For all you've done.

29:09.998 --> 29:11.040
Everything okay?

29:11.708 --> 29:16.337
Yeah. Let's just say, Fallon's not used
to doing her own laundry.

29:16.421 --> 29:20.633
I have help. A fully staffed kitchen.
You do not wanna let me near a kitchen.

29:20.717 --> 29:23.261
So, have you two set a date?

29:23.344 --> 29:25.805
We haven't, really. But you know what?

29:26.639 --> 29:29.058
You're eager for this to happen. So am I.

29:29.142 --> 29:33.313
Why are we waiting? Why not two weeks
from now? The venue's available.

29:34.230 --> 29:37.650
Well, I can hardly plan the event
of the season in two weeks.

29:37.734 --> 29:40.570
Throw enough money,
you can make anything work.

29:40.653 --> 29:44.449
Your father and Cristal did it in a couple
of days. Two weeks is plenty of time.

29:45.575 --> 29:47.619
Unless you have a reason to delay.

29:47.952 --> 29:51.623
Maybe Fallon just wants to enjoy
the engagement, and do things right.

29:54.417 --> 29:56.544
Is it your commitment issues again?

29:56.628 --> 30:00.799
Rip off the Band-Aid before you ruin
the best thing that's happened to you.

30:00.882 --> 30:02.383
Aside from me, of course.

30:02.467 --> 30:04.803
No, no, it's not that.

30:04.886 --> 30:05.929
Then what is it?

30:07.764 --> 30:08.640
Um...

30:09.140 --> 30:09.974
You know what?

30:10.725 --> 30:11.935
You're right.

30:12.018 --> 30:13.394
I don't need to be Amal.

30:13.478 --> 30:15.271
I can be Britney,

30:15.355 --> 30:17.857
without the shaved head
and the Vegas chapel.

30:21.152 --> 30:25.281
My God. I just realized this will make us
sisters. How crazy will that be?

30:27.867 --> 30:29.536
I can't watch this anymore.

30:30.703 --> 30:34.541
You all make me sick.
I don't recognize my own children!

30:34.624 --> 30:36.668
Dad, what are you talking about?

30:36.751 --> 30:40.213
My only son, cozying up to the daughter

30:40.296 --> 30:43.049
-of the very man that put me in prison.
-Dad--!

30:43.132 --> 30:44.092
-What?
-Yeah.

30:45.593 --> 30:49.806
I wasn't a drug addict as your father
claimed to the rest of the world.

30:50.557 --> 30:52.892
Your father framed me.

30:54.102 --> 30:54.978
That's insane.

30:55.061 --> 30:56.563
[Cecil] Ask your fiancé.

30:56.646 --> 30:57.814
Your best friend.

30:58.606 --> 31:00.942
They'll tell you, he framed me...

31:02.610 --> 31:05.196
right after he screwed my wife.

31:06.447 --> 31:09.576
And when I threatened to kill him
for taking her away,

31:09.659 --> 31:14.205
he took everything else away from me.
He took my children, he took my freedom.

31:14.747 --> 31:19.419
He planted blow in my car
and had his dirty cop friend arrest me.

31:19.502 --> 31:21.588
Had his dirty judge lock me away.

31:22.171 --> 31:24.048
No. That can't be true.

31:24.132 --> 31:28.052
Go on, deny it, when you know
it sounds like your daddy's MO! No!

31:28.344 --> 31:30.847
I will not stand by...

31:33.224 --> 31:35.435
and watch my only son...

31:36.728 --> 31:39.272
marry that bastard's dirty daughter.

32:12.931 --> 32:15.683
Dad always made me believe
my mom was the bad one.

32:16.809 --> 32:17.810
What do you mean?

32:22.023 --> 32:24.400
He said that she was the one
who cheated.

32:27.362 --> 32:29.781
That she was an awful person who left us.

32:30.239 --> 32:33.534
Left me, and left him.

32:37.038 --> 32:41.501
A shrink might even say
that sometimes I thought it was my fault.

32:42.043 --> 32:43.044

I didn't think you could get
all your thongs into one suitcase.

33:08.277 --> 33:11.364
Of things you've done,
this has to be the most idiotic.

33:11.447 --> 33:14.242
-How do--?
-I just got a call from the front gate.

33:14.325 --> 33:17.662
There was a Lyft driver there.
So, I sent him away.

33:17.745 --> 33:21.124
-They charge a cancellation fee.
-Why are you doing this?

33:21.207 --> 33:23.584
I'm tired of being a strain
on this family.

33:23.668 --> 33:28.089
If I'm not here, I can't drag Steven
or anyone else down with me.

33:28.172 --> 33:32.176
I have to say, I wasn't expecting you
to pull a Sammy Jo and run away.

33:32.260 --> 33:35.013
I was hoping
you might do something different.

33:35.096 --> 33:37.932
This family's invested
a lot of energy and money,

33:38.141 --> 33:41.811
in payoffs, blackmail and carbs,

33:41.894 --> 33:43.062
to keep you around.

33:43.896 --> 33:47.817
They value you. It would be silly
to walk away and have it wasted.

33:47.900 --> 33:51.654
Well, you don't understand.
It's not just because I'm a burden.

33:51.738 --> 33:54.532
I can't stay. I'm not here legally.

33:54.615 --> 33:57.285
Of course I understand.
I've been through it.

33:57.785 --> 34:00.663
Or did you think this Kiwi accent
was just for show?

34:02.165 --> 34:08.670
Now, this is the number of an immigration
lawyer. I've set up an appointment.

34:08.755 --> 34:12.467
Tomorrow, we'll start work
on your case together.

34:16.471 --> 34:19.306
This is the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

34:19.389 --> 34:22.435
Aside from keeping me out
of a murder investigation. [chuckles]

34:23.478 --> 34:27.231
Don't screw it up. You'll break
more than one heart if you do.

34:27.315 --> 34:28.649
[chuckles]

34:36.407 --> 34:38.701
[Rick] Dinner was excellent.

34:38.909 --> 34:41.161
-See you.
-If Steven's numbers

34:41.245 --> 34:42.746
are any indication, I'll be around.

34:46.042 --> 34:46.958
Great guy.

34:47.877 --> 34:51.797
Why did he send you flowers?
I saw the way he looked at you.

34:52.965 --> 34:55.301
We had a thing, a brief thing,

34:55.384 --> 34:58.429
-before I came to C.A.
-Brief enough to lie about flowers?

34:58.513 --> 35:01.099
It didn't mean anything,
and it was a long time ago.

35:04.393 --> 35:07.605
Men don't just send gifts
to reminisce about old times.

35:08.439 --> 35:11.275
Something else happen
between you two recently?

35:12.860 --> 35:15.863
We were working late together
on Steven's interview,

35:15.947 --> 35:19.450
and I think he got the wrong impression,
and he kissed me.

35:19.534 --> 35:22.370
But it's a harmless crush,
and I shut him down.

35:23.746 --> 35:26.791
He doesn't care about you.
He's using you to get to me.

35:26.874 --> 35:30.169
I've had a tail on Jeff Colby
since the parole hearing.

35:30.795 --> 35:32.713
And Anders caught Rick meeting with Jeff.

35:33.464 --> 35:34.924
-I don't understand.
-Well, I do.

35:35.383 --> 35:37.468
Even pure idealists have a price.

35:37.552 --> 35:40.680
And Colby's found Rick's,
and now we're gonna beat it.

35:40.763 --> 35:44.642
-When do you see him again?
-I'm not. I told him that can't happen,

35:44.725 --> 35:47.311
-he has to stay away.
-I don't want him to get away.

35:49.522 --> 35:52.191
Get as close to him as you possibly can.

36:00.116 --> 36:03.744
-Are you telling me to keep seeing Rick?
-Perfect opportunity.

36:03.828 --> 36:06.914
He has no idea you know
about his ties to the Colbys.

36:06.998 --> 36:10.710
-I need to find out what Jeff is up to.
-You listening to yourself?

36:10.793 --> 36:16.257
Yes, I am. Are you? You did
whatever it took to protect your family.

36:16.340 --> 36:18.551
Sam. What about the rest of us?

36:19.093 --> 36:22.513
So, what if you have to take advantage
of a harmless crush?

36:25.892 --> 36:28.978
-Unless it isn't harmless.
-I shouldn't be surprised.

36:30.479 --> 36:33.149
I mean, you whored your son out
to the press.

36:33.608 --> 36:35.651
Why not do the same to your wife?

36:35.735 --> 36:39.697
You may think that you can buy everyone,
Blake Carrington,

36:40.239 --> 36:43.784
but I am sure as hell
not letting you put a price tag on me.

36:50.625 --> 36:51.584
[Steven] Going somewhere? Not anymore.

36:54.045 --> 36:56.923
Good.
Because you're officially in the clear.

36:57.006 --> 37:00.384
Admiral Gerard Dinard
even sang my praises to the press

37:00.468 --> 37:02.720
before taking Ted to rehab in Indiana.

37:03.221 --> 37:06.724
Which means that my campaign base
has now broadened

37:06.807 --> 37:09.268
to include the U.S. military.

37:09.352 --> 37:12.396
Wait. The guy's name is Gerard Dinard?

37:13.022 --> 37:14.190
Yeah. [chuckles]

37:15.775 --> 37:18.236
Just when you thought that family
couldn't get any more screwed up.

37:18.778 --> 37:19.612
What's that?

37:19.695 --> 37:23.783
I mean, it's more Hall &amp; Oates
than George Michael,

37:23.866 --> 37:26.035
but I can get used to it.

37:27.203 --> 37:29.664
Anyway, I just wanted to give you...

37:30.373 --> 37:31.207
this.

37:33.751 --> 37:34.752
You got it back.

37:35.294 --> 37:37.880
Well, not that I need it.
You said it yourself.

37:37.964 --> 37:38.881
I have you now.

37:42.218 --> 37:45.846
Sam, after everything I said about Ted,

37:45.930 --> 37:50.268
I can't turn 180
and suddenly be with you now.

37:51.018 --> 37:53.771
I'm in the spotlight,
and the more you're with me,

37:53.854 --> 37:57.441
the bigger the chance
that someone will uncover your status.

37:57.525 --> 38:00.027
That's not gonna be an issue anymore.

38:01.445 --> 38:02.571
Also, I...

38:04.448 --> 38:06.617
I have a real chance at winning.

38:08.077 --> 38:10.663
Of finally making a difference.

38:11.038 --> 38:14.292
Of showing my dad
that I can be more than just his son.

38:14.792 --> 38:16.752
But I have to keep up the ruse...

38:17.586 --> 38:18.879
for that to happen.

38:21.632 --> 38:25.011
I'm just so close to succeeding
at something, Sam.

38:26.595 --> 38:28.514
You have to understand that.

38:30.391 --> 38:31.392
I do now.

38:33.644 --> 38:40.151
You know, I have to hand it to Ted.
He got what he wanted after all.

38:52.413 --> 38:54.582
[indistinct chatter over TV]

38:56.334 --> 38:57.585
What the hell, Dad?

38:57.752 --> 39:01.213
We are so close. You might have gone
and destroyed everything.

39:01.297 --> 39:04.383
You've put my relationship
with Fallon in jeopardy,

39:04.467 --> 39:07.178
a relationship I have been working on
for months.

39:07.261 --> 39:11.390
You know, sometimes you make me
almost ashamed of being a Colby.

39:11.474 --> 39:13.601
Then change your name. I don't mind.

39:13.851 --> 39:17.021
In fact, maybe you should change it
to Carrington.

39:17.313 --> 39:21.901
Yeah, I see how you look at her.
You're getting close to that family, son.

39:25.321 --> 39:28.199
While I was behind bars,
you were being showered

39:28.282 --> 39:31.494
in scholarships, jobs, a fiancé,
by our very enemy.

39:32.036 --> 39:35.206
-You're gonna blink, son.
-That is ridiculous.

39:35.289 --> 39:37.666
I feel nothing but ice
for the Carringtons.

39:38.209 --> 39:42.463
How can you? How you tell it,
Carrington practically raised you.

39:42.546 --> 39:46.509
He robbed me of being a real father
to you for all these years.

39:47.093 --> 39:49.845
But better late than never.
I'm gonna step up now,

39:50.388 --> 39:53.641
-starting with that plan of yours.
-What are you talking about?

39:53.724 --> 39:55.434
I have done all of this for you.

39:56.644 --> 40:00.564
A son should not have to pay
for his father's sins.

40:01.649 --> 40:06.070
I was wrong to get you twisted up
in this war, my war.

40:06.153 --> 40:10.199
But now the only way to end it
is for me to end it myself.

40:12.159 --> 40:13.536
You're done, Jeff.

40:16.997 --> 40:18.290
I'm taking over. Daddy's home.

40:28.551 --> 40:32.471
Wondering when you were gonna get back.
What were you doing at Colby's?

40:32.555 --> 40:34.932
-You had me followed?
-I had Jeff followed.

40:35.015 --> 40:37.017
You've been spending an awful lot of time
with that family.

40:37.101 --> 40:41.063
Spending time with them is the only way
for me to learn about mine.

40:41.147 --> 40:43.941
-You had an affair with Jeff's mom.
-Cecil tell you that?

40:44.024 --> 40:46.360
How you framed him and locked him away.

40:46.444 --> 40:51.198
-Your own marriage started falling apart.
-Did he mention that he tried to kill me?

40:51.282 --> 40:53.826
-The man is unstable.
-It all makes sense now.

40:53.909 --> 40:57.496
You made me think Mom was the whore
that destroyed your marriage

40:57.580 --> 41:00.124
when you were the monster
who pushed her away.

41:00.207 --> 41:03.294
-You destroyed our family.
-I was protecting our family.

41:04.003 --> 41:06.630
-And I never slept with Cecil's wife.
-God.

41:07.506 --> 41:11.135
I have been drowning in guilt
that I didn't listen to you.

41:12.595 --> 41:15.097
-That I let Jeff bug our server.
-You what?

41:15.931 --> 41:19.768
Back when I was trying to help Cristal,
the actual whore you married!

41:19.852 --> 41:21.937
I screwed up, I was trying to fix it.

41:22.021 --> 41:25.483
I got engaged to Jeff
so he wouldn't suspect I was onto him!

41:25.566 --> 41:28.110
Engaged? The two of you were dating?

41:30.029 --> 41:30.905
[slams desk]

41:30.988 --> 41:32.198
Seriously?

41:32.281 --> 41:34.742
That is what you care about right now?

41:35.367 --> 41:36.911
Screw you, Dad.

41:36.994 --> 41:41.290
Screw the Colbys for letting you rile them
into this ridiculous family feud.

41:41.373 --> 41:43.501
-I am done with all of you.
-Honey...

41:44.293 --> 41:45.544
you did screw up.

41:46.212 --> 41:47.421
More than you know.

41:47.505 --> 41:50.674
You got us into this mess,
so you're gonna dig us out.

41:50.758 --> 41:53.761
Don't tell me what to do.
I don't arrange my life

41:53.844 --> 41:56.639

according to Blake Carrington.

41:56.889 --> 41:59.642
I am done with you,
and I am done with Jeff.

41:59.725 --> 42:01.101
No, you're not!

42:02.937 --> 42:05.147
You're gonna marry that son of a bitch.
