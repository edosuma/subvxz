We need to identify members

Jump through

from the shareholders.

so that we can have a spot

And what part of your dream

03:57.070 --> 03:58.772

a bunch of strangers?

We built this company on music.

04:01.174 --> 04:03.777
And lately, we've been worried
about everything but.

04:03.811 --> 04:04.978
But if we go private,

04:06.179 --> 04:08.115
hundreds of millions of dollars.

07:19.940 --> 07:23.176
And also remember that precisely
why "Emotions" did well

that it was us.

08:43.957 --> 08:46.026
Oh, no, we're actually
gonna help you out.

08:46.059 --> 08:49.262
Gonna pick up some
crab cream for Anika here.

08:49.296 --> 08:51.865
(Thirsty laughs)

08:51.899 --> 08:54.101
-I don't have time for this.
-No, we don't.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.436
Yeah, well, you keep itching
and scratching and burning.

08:56.469 --> 08:57.605
(Lucious laughs)

08:57.638 --> 09:00.708
Oh, were you on your way
to see Sam Gold?

09:00.741 --> 09:02.109
'Cause we just came from there.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.611
What, he didn't call you?

09:03.644 --> 09:06.113
Probably wanted
to tell you in person.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.347
Good guy, Sam.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.216
But he's not interested.

09:09.249 --> 09:10.718
You know why?

09:10.751 --> 09:13.053
Because he knows
that if he fronts you the money,

09:13.086 --> 09:15.355
then he has to go up
against Kelly Patel,

09:15.388 --> 09:18.291
and he's not built like that.

09:18.325 --> 09:20.260
THIRSTY: This is Thirsty
Rawlings for Sam Gold, please.

09:20.293 --> 09:23.864
And frankly, my beloveds,

09:23.897 --> 09:25.498
neither are you.

09:37.444 --> 09:40.147
You keep playing games
with me, Eddie.

09:41.949 --> 09:44.484
Not gonna beat me.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.988
You sure about that, Lu?

10:01.869 --> 10:03.804
*

10:06.306 --> 10:08.341
LUCIOUS: Thank you, Quincy.
Hey, you said

10:08.375 --> 10:10.243
it was a blood sport
from day one,

10:10.277 --> 10:11.478
but I'm just glad
you still my man

10:11.511 --> 10:14.247
and Eddie
wasn't able to seduce you.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.016
I know that you and Barack
are still on vacation.

10:16.049 --> 10:19.519
That's why I'm so happy
you took this call. Thank you.

10:19.552 --> 10:21.154
That sounds good.

10:21.188 --> 10:22.856
Yes.

10:22.890 --> 10:24.191
-So, where we at?
-Well, um,

10:24.224 --> 10:26.493
with Oprah's offering,
we tack on another point

10:26.526 --> 10:28.628
-per share, so...
-We did it.

10:28.662 --> 10:30.130
-ANDRE: Yes, sir.
-LUCIOUS: Yeah!

10:30.163 --> 10:31.799
Today was, um,
it was a master class

10:31.832 --> 10:33.433
in relationship building.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.169
I told you me and your mama
had something new to teach you.

10:36.203 --> 10:37.437
THIRSTY:
Lucious.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.639
We got a problem.
Turn on the news.

10:42.042 --> 10:44.444
Let's take a look.
This morning...

10:44.477 --> 10:46.079
Why are our shares going up?

10:47.380 --> 10:50.183
Because Kelly Patel
is buying them at a premium.

10:50.217 --> 10:52.352
We can't just keep raising money
and let them buy the company

10:52.385 --> 10:53.553
out from under us anyway.

10:53.586 --> 10:55.222
I mean, isn't there some way
we can find out

10:55.255 --> 10:56.790
what his top dollar is?

10:56.824 --> 10:59.893
I can get the number.

10:59.927 --> 11:02.495
Look, Eddie thinks that I agree
with his strategy for Empire.

11:02.529 --> 11:04.798
I can make him think
I bailed on you two.

11:04.832 --> 11:06.666
Eddie's not that stupid.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.035
Yeah. Yeah, how in the hell

11:08.068 --> 11:11.004
would you make
something like that work?

11:11.038 --> 11:12.672
Well, Eddie thinks
th-there's friction

11:12.706 --> 11:14.074
between Andre
and the rest of the family.

11:14.107 --> 11:17.144
I mean, he even asked me
about it. It might work.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.747
I know exactly
what to say to him.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.252
ANDRE:
My father turned his back on me,

11:25.285 --> 11:28.221
and there's nothing I can do
to get his respect.

11:28.255 --> 11:30.590
That is why I'm here,
that's the only reason I'm here.

11:30.623 --> 11:32.525
How much more of this
do we have to listen to?

11:32.559 --> 11:33.861
Why the change of heart?

11:33.894 --> 11:35.662
You didn't back my play
with your parents.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.865
Lucious wants to take
the company backwards.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.500
I don't.
We don't belong in the back.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.102
If I have to come here and...

11:42.135 --> 11:45.372
and I have to do this with you,
then I'm... I'm willing.

11:45.405 --> 11:48.375
If it makes things right
over there, I'm-I'm willing.

11:48.408 --> 11:49.542
(chuckling)

11:49.576 --> 11:50.677
Really?

11:50.710 --> 11:52.712
Eddie. This nonsense?

11:52.746 --> 11:54.848
Anika, you know
as well as anyone

11:54.882 --> 11:57.417
that Lucious can't stand to be
in the same room as me.

11:57.450 --> 11:58.886
You also know as well as anyone

11:58.919 --> 12:01.554
that Empire
could be so much bigger

12:01.588 --> 12:03.090
if not for his limitations.

12:03.123 --> 12:05.859
Now, banging out singles
is not enough in 2018.

12:05.893 --> 12:08.028
-You know it and I know it.
-Okay.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.163
So why do I need you?

12:13.666 --> 12:16.069
I'm a Lyon.

12:21.441 --> 12:22.742
It's not a coup that works

12:22.776 --> 12:24.812
if you don't have a Lyon
by your side, Uncle.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.880
I'm that Lyon.

12:26.914 --> 12:29.783
My daughter's a Lyon.

12:29.817 --> 12:32.485
-We're good here.
-No, no. Listen, Eddie.

12:32.519 --> 12:33.921
Uncle Eddie.

12:35.488 --> 12:36.957
You're not like Lucious, okay?

12:36.990 --> 12:38.591
Don't-don't let emotion
get in the way

12:38.625 --> 12:39.893
of good business--
you said that.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.995
You-you told me that.

12:42.029 --> 12:44.231
I'm willing
to set up a press conference

12:44.264 --> 12:46.333
and announce
my allegiance to you.

12:46.366 --> 12:50.470
In front of everybody--
anytime, anyplace.

12:50.503 --> 12:52.305
Anywhere.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.708
Your call.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.680
Hmm.

13:00.713 --> 13:02.515
ANDRE:
I have the utmost confidence

13:02.549 --> 13:05.618
that Eddie Barker,
a longtime friend of our family,

13:05.652 --> 13:07.354
and a good friend,

13:07.387 --> 13:10.858
will lead Empire
into this bright new era.

13:10.891 --> 13:12.425
Now, my parents did
a great thing

13:12.459 --> 13:14.928
giving birth to this company,
but, uh...

13:14.962 --> 13:16.429
but they're artists,
not business people,

13:16.463 --> 13:18.431
and it's time
that Empire went global.

13:18.465 --> 13:22.302
With Kelly Patel's
acquisition, it will.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.071
Thank you.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.274
We only have time
for a few questions,

13:27.307 --> 13:28.808
so let's keep them short,
please. Rebecca.

13:28.842 --> 13:32.345
Are you planning on buying out
all of the Lyons' shares?

13:32.379 --> 13:33.780
EDDIE:
That's a question, we, uh...

13:33.813 --> 13:35.315
-REPORTER: Cookie!
-One second. H-Hold on.

13:35.348 --> 13:37.951
Hey! Hey, Cookie, what's up
with your son's flip?

13:37.985 --> 13:39.219
-Uh, no comment.
-He doubts your ability

13:39.252 --> 13:42.189
to run Empire--
what do you say to that?

13:42.222 --> 13:43.523
EDDIE:
Everybody...

13:43.556 --> 13:45.692
(excited chatter)

13:45.725 --> 13:49.129
(reporters clamoring)

13:49.162 --> 13:51.298
EDDIE:
Let's take the questions

13:51.331 --> 13:53.901
-one at a time.
-(chatter continues)

13:58.205 --> 13:59.206
Lady and gentleman,
congratulations.

13:59.239 --> 14:00.673
I'd like to make a toast.

14:00.707 --> 14:02.142
To the Empire.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.644
-To the Empire. Cheers.
-To the Empire.

14:04.677 --> 14:05.712
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

14:05.745 --> 14:08.715
You might not have made
the easy choice,

14:08.748 --> 14:11.851
-but you made
the right one, Andre.
-Damn straight.

14:11.885 --> 14:14.387
That's one of the hardest things
I've ever had to do, but...

14:14.421 --> 14:16.356
-it feels right.
-I am genuinely excited

14:16.389 --> 14:17.925
about this content play.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.859
EDDIE: We'll keep
luring them in with music,

14:19.893 --> 14:22.062
and you'll take the user data
and monetize it

14:22.095 --> 14:24.397
-every which way to Sunday.
-(Anika chuckles)

14:24.431 --> 14:26.766
Why are we cooped up in here?
Let's go out.

14:26.799 --> 14:28.601
-Let's celebrate.
-All right!

14:28.635 --> 14:30.870
-All right.
-Sounds like a plan to me.

14:30.904 --> 14:33.673
-So, where do you want to go?
-You tell me.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.042
-I chose last time.
-Okay.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.744
-You choose this time.
And you're paying.
-Okay.

14:37.777 --> 14:41.614
-Oh. Forgot my jacket.
I'll catch up.
-All right.

14:46.253 --> 14:48.755
(camera clicking)

14:50.423 --> 14:52.192
You all right, Andre?

14:52.225 --> 14:54.727
-Got my jacket.
-Let's get out of here.

14:54.761 --> 14:57.230
-(phone chimes)
-LUCIOUS: Oh, wow.

14:57.264 --> 14:58.565
Andre came through.

14:58.598 --> 15:02.469
He found Kelly Patel's
bottom line number.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.938
-$650 million.
-(scoffs)

15:04.972 --> 15:06.306
(Thirsty laughs)

15:06.339 --> 15:07.540
We ain't got it.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.276
And Eddie and Patel
put a chokehold

15:09.309 --> 15:10.810
on the bank and the VC money.

15:10.843 --> 15:12.445
Maybe we need to, uh,
circle back around

15:12.479 --> 15:13.580
to that punk, Sam Gold.

15:13.613 --> 15:15.815
No, damn it.
I am sick and tired

15:15.848 --> 15:17.484
of looking
for the great white hope

15:17.517 --> 15:20.453
with deep pockets
to come and save the day.

15:20.487 --> 15:22.322
Enough of that.

15:26.994 --> 15:29.963
Lucious, do you remember
when PGW turned off the heat

15:29.997 --> 15:31.298
in the dead of winter?

15:31.331 --> 15:34.801
(laughs)
How could I forget, man?

15:34.834 --> 15:36.403
It was so cold.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.671
Remember all those
inventive ways

15:38.705 --> 15:41.274
we came up with to stay warm?

15:41.308 --> 15:43.476
My point is, who helped us?

15:43.510 --> 15:46.279
Mike-Mike. He came in big-time.

15:46.313 --> 15:50.050
He-he gave us, um, a couple
kerosene heaters and a...

15:51.884 --> 15:55.922
I see where you're going
with this.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.191
What?

15:58.225 --> 15:59.459
We go back to our roots.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.094
Damn right.
See, on the block,

16:01.128 --> 16:02.629
if you couldn't cover your rent,

16:02.662 --> 16:04.031
-you threw a party.
-(chuckles)

16:04.064 --> 16:06.699
People chipped in, you were good
for another month.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.035
Well, you know what,
I'm so glad

16:08.068 --> 16:09.869
that we can afford
a trip down memory lane.

16:09.902 --> 16:11.871
But we're talking about
a lot more money

16:11.904 --> 16:13.506
than a couple of hundred bucks

16:13.540 --> 16:15.108
for the electric bill.
We're talking about

16:15.142 --> 16:16.409
60 to 70 mil.

16:17.810 --> 16:22.049
So... we throw a live concert
on XStream.

16:22.082 --> 16:25.318
LUCIOUS: We could set up
a separate account

16:25.352 --> 16:28.688
for the crowd fundraising.
If we don't make enough

16:28.721 --> 16:30.723
to buy back the company,
we give them their money back.

16:30.757 --> 16:35.228
But if we make enough,
we pay them back when we can.

16:35.262 --> 16:36.663
Bingo.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.898
Ain't no party
like a rent party.

16:38.931 --> 16:40.533
(laughs)

16:42.735 --> 16:44.571
These were my lucky shoes.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.973
Well, your luck's
about to run out.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.975
The Lyons are
all kinds of crazy.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.844
What makes you think Andre
is any different?

16:51.878 --> 16:53.813
Can't you see he's playing us?

16:53.846 --> 16:55.315
Or am I playing him?

16:55.348 --> 16:59.352
No. You can't trust him
or Anika for that matter.

16:59.386 --> 17:02.322
She's got duplicitous bitch
written all over her fake boobs.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.257
I think they're real.

17:04.291 --> 17:05.492
That was a test.

17:05.525 --> 17:06.826
Why are you even looking?

17:06.859 --> 17:09.096
-(Eddie laughs)
-No, why are you laughing?

17:09.129 --> 17:12.399
I can't have you distracted
right now. Think!

17:12.432 --> 17:15.168
(sighs) What matters...

17:15.202 --> 17:17.737
is do you trust me?

17:20.107 --> 17:21.741
What matters...

17:21.774 --> 17:26.379
is that in all of our deals...

17:26.413 --> 17:27.514
BOTH:
We've always had

17:27.547 --> 17:29.716
an ace up our sleeves. Yes.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.358
Where's your ace?

17:38.391 --> 17:40.093
That's why I called you.

17:40.127 --> 17:42.229
(scoffs)

17:42.262 --> 17:43.730
I need you
to do something for me.

17:43.763 --> 17:44.931
-You always need me...
-Hey.

17:44.964 --> 17:47.300
-...to do something for you.
-Hey.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.048
COOKIE:
Veronica's in our lineup

18:02.081 --> 18:03.816
for the rent party,
so that's good.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.885
Yeah, well,
we can forget about Tiana.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.821
You know, she's out.
Eddie got her head so gassed up,

18:08.855 --> 18:10.990
she don't know which way is up.

18:11.023 --> 18:15.128
We don't need or want
her auto-tuned ass.

18:15.162 --> 18:16.729
-LUCIOUS: Amen.
-COOKIE: We got our babies,

18:16.763 --> 18:18.398
Jamal and Hakeem.

18:18.431 --> 18:21.134
-TBD decided to stay with Eddie.
-Of course they did.

18:21.168 --> 18:24.070
-They struggling
to stay relevant, old hags.
-(Lucious laughs)

18:24.103 --> 18:25.438
(barks)

18:25.472 --> 18:27.073
COOKIE:
We gave them Marmadukes

18:27.106 --> 18:30.143
-a-a second life.
-(laughs) Marmaduke.

18:30.177 --> 18:31.844
They need to be kissing
our feet.

18:31.878 --> 18:33.913
You guys, you have to see this.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.114
It's Blake's father.

18:35.148 --> 18:38.485
Got this hip-hoppety guy,
Licorice Lyon,

18:38.518 --> 18:39.986
got our young people talking,

18:40.019 --> 18:42.255
-dressing like thugs.
-HOST: It's hit pretty close

18:42.289 --> 18:44.524
-to home for you, hasn't it?
-Done filled my son Blake's head

18:44.557 --> 18:46.493
with so much stuff, he don't
know he's white anymore.

18:46.526 --> 18:48.361
-All right, all right.
-How the hell
did he get in here?

18:48.395 --> 18:50.029
We get to hear my side
of the story now?

18:50.062 --> 18:52.332
Jason, can you get
this guy a-a microphone?

18:52.365 --> 18:54.701
What do you want to say
to your father, hmm?

18:54.734 --> 18:57.036
BLAKE:
You know, that picture you saw,

18:57.069 --> 19:00.473
yeah, that's me, in front
of his broken down house.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.975
My hand is raised because
he told me to raise it.

19:03.009 --> 19:04.544
He said it would make me look

19:04.577 --> 19:06.713
like I was really his son,
you remember that?

19:06.746 --> 19:07.880
-JACKSON: Yes, I do.
-BLAKE: Yeah.

19:07.914 --> 19:10.517
You know what, Dad?

19:10.550 --> 19:12.485
I would've done anything

19:12.519 --> 19:17.524
for you to treat me like
I was really your son. (sighs)

19:17.557 --> 19:20.227
Until the next day. Yeah.

19:20.260 --> 19:23.996
When you took me to that crazy
rally with those crazy racists.

19:24.030 --> 19:26.199
-(audience exclaiming)
-I went back

19:26.233 --> 19:28.067
to my mom's house that night,
and I ain't seen

19:28.100 --> 19:29.736
or heard from this dude...

19:29.769 --> 19:32.639
-in the 15 years since then!
-Boy!

19:32.672 --> 19:36.476
(both shouting)

19:36.509 --> 19:38.044
You don't know who...

19:38.077 --> 19:42.249
Keem, make sure he's
at the rent party.

19:42.282 --> 19:44.551
You believe him?

19:44.584 --> 19:46.519
I do.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.722
-Um...
-Does it matter?

19:49.756 --> 19:53.493
I mean, that video's about
to go viral right now.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.662
I mean, we over here struggling
to stay alive.

19:55.695 --> 19:58.231
You know how many viewers
that's gonna bring in?

19:58.265 --> 20:00.199
-Think about it.
-(sighs)

20:00.233 --> 20:02.602
You know what,
speaking of viral,

20:02.635 --> 20:06.573
there's one more act
that we need up on that stage.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.578
Hey. I want to see you.

20:11.611 --> 20:13.045
Excuse me.

20:19.419 --> 20:21.153
Drink this.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.023
I need your band.

20:24.056 --> 20:27.093
My tour band? All right.

20:27.126 --> 20:28.595
No, your real band.

20:28.628 --> 20:32.098
That little Fortress of Solitude
band you hide behind.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.604
Someone tell you?
How'd you find out?

20:39.506 --> 20:42.809
Maybe it's the vibrato you put
at the end of your long notes

20:42.842 --> 20:46.279
or was it that extra deep breath

20:46.313 --> 20:48.548
you take before your chorus?

20:48.581 --> 20:49.816
Which one do you think?

20:49.849 --> 20:52.952
All right, you got me.

20:54.621 --> 20:57.457
As far as bringing my band,
the answer is no.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.759
Really?

21:03.663 --> 21:06.566
Everybody in this world
right now wants

21:06.599 --> 21:09.436
to know who is
this mystery band.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.838
Now, if we reveal you
at the rent party,

21:11.871 --> 21:14.841
can you imagine how many viewers
are gonna tune in?

21:14.874 --> 21:17.477
Yeah, I can.

21:17.510 --> 21:20.347
It's a shame you didn't realize
that before you called it junk.

21:20.380 --> 21:22.181
No, it's not about what I think.

21:22.214 --> 21:24.283
It's about you helping
the family when we need you.

21:24.317 --> 21:27.253
I am helping the family.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.356
So either accept me
performing solo

21:29.389 --> 21:30.923
or don't accept me
performing solo

21:30.957 --> 21:33.693
and I'll still do it,
because I help the family.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.201
Dad, don't you miss it?

21:42.234 --> 21:44.170
Huh? Not making music

21:44.203 --> 21:47.707
for-for ticket sales or units
sold or anything like that.

21:47.740 --> 21:51.210
Just making music.

21:51.243 --> 21:52.812
Ain't no way
you don't miss that.

21:52.845 --> 21:54.347
I miss it about as much

21:54.381 --> 21:57.884
as I miss watching you hungry
at night.

21:57.917 --> 22:00.853
Because I was too busy
playing music to get money

22:00.887 --> 22:02.655
to feed you.

22:04.524 --> 22:06.726
Think about where
your loyalties are.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.329
(elevator bell dings)

22:19.105 --> 22:20.873
HAKEEM: This is our rent party,
so let's keep the cash flowing!

22:20.907 --> 22:22.975
Before I kick this off, man,
I want to salute

22:23.009 --> 22:26.212
my boy here, Blake. Now, this
brother stood tall even though

22:26.245 --> 22:27.914
everybody around him,
myself included,

22:27.947 --> 22:29.716
thought the worst of him.

22:29.749 --> 22:32.719
My apologies, bro.

22:32.752 --> 22:34.253
-Always.
-(cheering and applause)

22:37.390 --> 22:40.226
Now, love is love, right?

22:40.259 --> 22:42.061
(cheering)

22:42.094 --> 22:43.930
So I'm about
to ask y'all a question.

22:45.131 --> 22:47.500
Who trying to show us
some love tonight?

22:47.534 --> 22:49.235
(cheering)

22:49.268 --> 22:50.737
(laughs)

22:50.770 --> 22:52.539
Let's keep Empire
with the Lyon family!

22:52.572 --> 22:54.340
Let's go!

22:54.373 --> 22:56.275
* Microphone checka

22:56.308 --> 22:59.011
* Crowd rock selector,
feeling like the GOAT *

22:59.045 --> 23:01.280
* The rap god, et cetera,
surrounded by greatness *

23:01.313 --> 23:02.949
* Gold plaques, I'm next up

23:02.982 --> 23:05.452
* This'll be the record
to break all the records *

23:05.485 --> 23:08.120
* Number one on Billboard,
payin' all my bills off *

23:08.154 --> 23:10.757
* Living in the moment, type
of life some people kill for *

23:10.790 --> 23:13.626
* Done with the hate,
put my Instagram on ignore *

23:13.660 --> 23:15.862
-* Yo, Keem,
where you at, son? *
-* Yeah, I'm just trying

23:15.895 --> 23:17.630
* To get it all,
get it all, argh *

23:17.664 --> 23:20.232
* Shout-out to the homies
living sky-high *

23:20.266 --> 23:22.469
* I'm back with the prince,
no Cyhi *

23:22.502 --> 23:24.704
* Every shorty want
to be the wifey *

23:24.737 --> 23:26.105
You about to rob the place?

23:26.138 --> 23:28.240
-* I just hit her
with the Wi-Fi *
-(chuckles)

23:28.274 --> 23:29.942
I just came to see
what kind of low-rent thing

23:29.976 --> 23:31.277
y'all slapped together.

23:31.310 --> 23:34.781
You know, this is really
embarrassing the label, Becky.

23:34.814 --> 23:35.982
* Lemons into lemonade...

23:36.015 --> 23:37.717
All right, girl. Whatever.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.218
* Tell me how you love that

23:39.251 --> 23:41.420
* Tell me
how you love that *

23:41.454 --> 23:43.289
* Oh, yeah, we up above that
Yo, yo, yo, hold up.

23:43.322 --> 23:44.891
* Tell me how you love that...

23:44.924 --> 23:46.225
Hey, cut the music.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.795
-(music stops)
-(cheering)

23:48.828 --> 23:50.763
Hold up,
we got somebody special

23:50.797 --> 23:51.998
in the building tonight.

23:52.031 --> 23:53.633
I want to dedicate

23:53.666 --> 23:56.803
my performance to somebody
that's always been trill.

23:56.836 --> 23:58.237
She's here
rockin' with me tonight,

23:58.270 --> 24:00.306
reppin' hard
for my family tonight.

24:00.339 --> 24:02.909
-(laughs): Aw.
-I need y'all to make some noise

24:02.942 --> 24:05.812
-for my baby.
-(cheering, shouting)

24:05.845 --> 24:07.480
I want y'all
to make some noise...

24:07.514 --> 24:09.448
Haven.

24:11.117 --> 24:14.587
Excuse me, girl.
Love your new song.

24:14.621 --> 24:17.790
Bloop...!

24:19.626 --> 24:22.461
(intro to "Big Shoes" playing)

24:28.668 --> 24:30.169
* Mm, mm, mm

24:30.202 --> 24:32.505
Don't want to pick up your face?

24:32.539 --> 24:34.807
HAVEN: You know you got
some really big shoes

24:34.841 --> 24:36.609
-to fill, right?
-Uh-huh.

24:36.643 --> 24:39.211
* Big shoes, big shoes

24:39.245 --> 24:41.848
* My new one got some
really big shoes to fill *

24:41.881 --> 24:43.349
-* Made moves, made moves
-* Don't move *

24:43.382 --> 24:46.653
* I moved on,
but I think about you for real *

24:46.686 --> 24:47.987
* Think about you

24:48.020 --> 24:50.156
* For real,
think about you *

24:50.189 --> 24:52.391
* I still think about you

24:52.424 --> 24:55.161
* Ah, thinking 'bout you
got me sick under your voodoo *

24:55.194 --> 24:58.230
* Sick of my old chick,
I want that new, new, who knew *

24:58.264 --> 25:00.199
* That you would be the one
riding shotgun with me *

25:00.232 --> 25:02.669
-* Blowing clouds
through the moonroof *
-* Still thinking 'bout ya

25:02.702 --> 25:05.171
-* Touching on my body,
still thinking 'bout ya *
-* I know

25:05.204 --> 25:06.405
-* I don't wanna fight it
-* Okay

25:06.438 --> 25:07.874
* You're the one
that got me thinking *

25:07.907 --> 25:10.042
* 'Bout calling,
I'm a sexaholic *

25:10.076 --> 25:12.011
* Sexaholic for you

25:12.044 --> 25:13.379
* Big shoes, big shoes

25:13.412 --> 25:16.549
* My new one got some
really big shoes to fill... *

25:16.583 --> 25:18.551
Hello, gentlemen.

25:18.585 --> 25:20.486
Looking for me?

25:20.519 --> 25:23.255
-* Big shoes, big shoes,
my new one got... *
-* Yeah

25:23.289 --> 25:27.259
We know that you've been going
back and forth to your family.

25:29.596 --> 25:31.530
We hoped that you would.

25:31.564 --> 25:33.099
Um, I...

25:33.132 --> 25:34.601
I-I don't understand.

25:34.634 --> 25:37.003
We wanted you
to find our number,

25:37.036 --> 25:40.406
scare your folks into...
not even trying.

25:40.439 --> 25:43.576
But God knows,
Lucious and Cookie...

25:43.610 --> 25:45.411
they don't scare easy.

25:45.444 --> 25:47.780
Andre...

25:47.814 --> 25:51.450
I've known you
since you were a little kid.

25:51.483 --> 25:54.486
And I know how much
you love your family.

25:55.822 --> 25:59.258
And it pains me to see
how they treated you.

25:59.291 --> 26:04.296
Lucious, h-he doesn't
even respect your artistry.

26:04.330 --> 26:07.266
Your parents
will never reach the number,

26:07.299 --> 26:09.869
because they're chasing
the wrong one.

26:09.902 --> 26:12.471
I'm going $700 million.

26:12.504 --> 26:15.274
And I'm telling you this because
this fooling around has to stop.

26:15.307 --> 26:16.442
EDDIE:
Listen to me on this.

26:16.475 --> 26:20.913
There are families
that you're born into...

26:20.947 --> 26:25.317
then there are families
that you choose.

26:26.185 --> 26:28.554
You belong with us.

26:28.587 --> 26:31.323
Shut down this...
XStream server

26:31.357 --> 26:34.894
and kill this
ridiculous rent party.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.562
KELLY:
You do that,

26:36.595 --> 26:40.166
and tomorrow morning we'll be
on a private jet to Palo Alto...

26:40.199 --> 26:42.902
where I'll introduce you
to my board

26:42.935 --> 26:46.272
as the new chief
financial officer of my company.

26:46.305 --> 26:49.642
The company
that will own Empire.

26:49.676 --> 26:53.813
This is the opportunity
of your dreams.

26:53.846 --> 26:55.948
You deserve it.

26:55.982 --> 26:58.417
Don't pass it up.

26:58.450 --> 27:02.288
Do not let this slip
from your fingers.

27:08.661 --> 27:10.997
(exhales)

27:11.030 --> 27:12.665
(phone vibrating)

27:30.516 --> 27:32.819
(turns off faucet)

27:32.852 --> 27:34.286
(elevator bell dings)

27:34.320 --> 27:36.155
Hey, Lou. How's it going?

27:36.188 --> 27:37.824
Andre Lyon,
down in the dungeons.

27:37.857 --> 27:39.658
-How are you, sir?
-I'm fantastic.

27:39.692 --> 27:41.527
Listen, you ever
take a break, Lou?

27:41.560 --> 27:43.229
Like I said, the dungeons.

27:43.262 --> 27:44.831
Why don't you take five.

27:44.864 --> 27:46.833
(laughs)

27:46.866 --> 27:47.900
Make it ten.

27:49.869 --> 27:50.870
Make it ten, Lou.

27:50.903 --> 27:52.171
Okay.

27:52.204 --> 27:54.373
-Thanks.
-Mm-hmm.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.548
(elevator bell dings)

28:02.581 --> 28:04.383
(cheering, whooping)

28:04.416 --> 28:06.418
Great performance,
you guys! Yes!

28:06.452 --> 28:08.821
Look. Chrissy and-and-and John.

28:08.855 --> 28:11.724
-Oh, wow, that's beautiful.
-Yes.

28:11.758 --> 28:14.393
-COOKIE: What's going on?
-Wait, our monitor's frozen.

28:14.426 --> 28:16.495
Check your phone.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.264
LUCIOUS:
It's frozen.

28:19.431 --> 28:21.801
They've locked us out
of XStream.

28:29.809 --> 28:31.077
You think we were hacked?

28:31.110 --> 28:33.880
-This has got Eddie written
all over it.
-ANDRE: It was me.

28:33.913 --> 28:35.214
-What?
-I-I shut down XStream.

28:35.247 --> 28:37.083
-Why would you do that?!
-Patel is going as high

28:37.116 --> 28:39.451
as $700 million, Pop.
They played me.

28:39.485 --> 28:42.621
I had to shut down XStream.
I-I had to play along.

28:42.654 --> 28:45.024
Well, I'm glad you played along.
You just cost us

28:45.057 --> 28:46.292
-the whole company.
-COOKIE: No, wait.

28:46.325 --> 28:49.695
-Lucious!
-I just gave us
our only hope, Pop.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.630
-How?
-I put everything on a timer.

28:51.663 --> 28:55.467
The servers go live again
in 15 minutes with no paywall.

28:55.501 --> 28:57.303
Paywall? What does that mean?

28:57.336 --> 28:58.805
It goes straight out
to the Internet.

28:58.838 --> 29:01.640
So now you two can show anybody
anywhere in the world

29:01.673 --> 29:04.777
exactly what it is
that we're fighting for.

29:04.811 --> 29:06.813
That's my big brain baby.

29:06.846 --> 29:08.781
I'll be right back.

29:08.815 --> 29:11.217
-That's brilliant.
-COOKIE: Hey, everybody.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.619
Hi. Having a good time?

29:13.652 --> 29:15.754
(audience cheering)

29:15.788 --> 29:18.124
Are you having fun yet?

29:18.157 --> 29:19.926
You know what I need you to do?

29:19.959 --> 29:21.493
Get your phones out right now.

29:21.527 --> 29:23.595
Oh, that's not a joke, baby.
Get your phone out.

29:23.629 --> 29:25.631
-I'm very serious.
-All right.

29:25.664 --> 29:28.434
I need you to go

29:28.467 --> 29:31.303
tell all of your followers
that in 15 minutes,

29:31.337 --> 29:33.405
when Empire XStream
goes back up,

29:33.439 --> 29:37.476
we have something that
is going to shock the world.

29:37.509 --> 29:39.311
-(cheering)
-Go ahead, get them cameras.

29:39.345 --> 29:40.479
* Last time that I checked

29:40.512 --> 29:42.581

on my neck *

29:42.614 --> 29:44.583
* It was no smut on my rep

29:44.616 --> 29:45.852

Okay, what do we got

29:47.386 --> 29:48.955

29:48.988 --> 29:51.357
* No sweat,

29:51.390 --> 29:52.925
* I'm the street's voice
out west *

29:52.959 --> 29:54.961

29:54.994 --> 29:57.463
* First get the money,

30:08.040 --> 30:09.808
AZAL:
Got room for this?

30:09.842 --> 30:11.110
Of course, of course.

30:11.143 --> 30:12.811
Merci beaucoup.
Thank you.

30:12.845 --> 30:14.180
* I taught you
how to charge more... *

30:14.213 --> 30:16.482
(ringtone playing)

30:16.515 --> 30:18.150
TORY: What's up? We're
on our way to rehearsal, Jamal.

30:18.184 --> 30:21.787
I thought you were dealing with
some sort of Lyon family drama.

30:21.820 --> 30:22.654
Hey, y'all, um,

30:22.688 --> 30:24.056
-I need a favor, all right?
-100%.

30:24.090 --> 30:26.492
Look, everybody's wondering
about who we are,

30:26.525 --> 30:29.328
so... can y'all
just hop on stage with me?

30:29.361 --> 30:30.729
-TORY: Wow.
-(whistles)

30:30.762 --> 30:32.498
-What?
-Look, I would never

30:32.531 --> 30:34.500
even ask, but my-my family's
whole future

30:34.533 --> 30:36.635
-is depending on it.
-What, so you want me to risk

30:36.668 --> 30:39.872
-my future for your
family's bottom line?
-No, Tory.

30:39.906 --> 30:42.541
It's not about money, it's about
the Lyons keeping what's ours.

30:42.574 --> 30:44.543
But if we hold on to each other
and we hold on

30:44.576 --> 30:45.711
to who we are, we'll be fine.

30:45.744 --> 30:47.379
This guy sounded real different
a few days ago.

30:47.413 --> 30:48.915
I hope y'all know by now

30:48.948 --> 30:51.550
that I would do the exact
same thing for y'all.

30:51.583 --> 30:53.152
Look, man, it ain't
that serious, y'all.

30:53.185 --> 30:54.887
Let's just do it.
Like, I'm down.

30:54.921 --> 30:56.055
Yeah. I'm cool.

30:56.088 --> 30:57.189
Let's do it.

30:57.223 --> 30:59.191
A'ight. Fine, let's do it.

30:59.225 --> 31:01.393
But you owe us, man.

31:01.427 --> 31:02.995
I definitely owe you, man.

31:03.029 --> 31:04.363
Tory?

31:04.396 --> 31:05.831
You know what, Jamal?

31:05.864 --> 31:08.234
The difference
between me and you

31:08.267 --> 31:10.502
is that I wouldn't
have asked you to.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.371
When are you gonna stop
risking everything

31:12.404 --> 31:14.373
just to get
your daddy's approval?

31:14.406 --> 31:16.909
You guys can go ahead,
but I'm out.

31:22.214 --> 31:23.549
* Last time that I checked.

31:23.582 --> 31:26.118
(audience cheering)

31:26.152 --> 31:27.586
All right, now, listen up.

31:27.619 --> 31:30.889
Listen up. All right.

31:30.923 --> 31:32.959
I need y'all
to hit y'all socials

31:32.992 --> 31:35.361
real hard right now.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.096
Because in the next few minutes,

31:37.129 --> 31:40.566
we've got the number one song
in the country

31:40.599 --> 31:42.468
by the number one group
in the country.

31:42.501 --> 31:44.303
And what's the name
of that group?

31:44.336 --> 31:47.039
ALL:
Anonymous!

31:47.073 --> 31:49.808
(cheering)

31:49.841 --> 31:51.677

31:53.946 --> 31:57.783
COOKIE: Whoo!
Look at those numbers go, baby!

31:57.816 --> 31:58.985
(whooping)

31:59.018 --> 32:01.653
LUCIOUS: Now,
y'all need to know something.

32:01.687 --> 32:05.157
Empire has been around
for almost 20 years.

32:05.191 --> 32:08.294
You want to know why?

32:08.327 --> 32:09.795
AUDIENCE:
Why?

32:09.828 --> 32:11.897
Because of the love
and support of family.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.066
(cheering)

32:14.100 --> 32:16.068
Because of the love
and support of friends.

32:16.102 --> 32:19.305
And because
of the people like you

32:19.338 --> 32:22.108
who we make this music for.

32:22.141 --> 32:23.642
(beeping rapidly)

32:25.144 --> 32:27.813
That's right,
and people like us,

32:27.846 --> 32:31.017
people like us
that come from the struggle,

32:31.050 --> 32:35.854
and come out on the other side
with our heads held high.

32:35.887 --> 32:40.326
And if you want to know
why we went public with Empire,

32:40.359 --> 32:43.762
it was because a dream
we started almost 20 years ago.

32:43.795 --> 32:47.599
We thought that
if we could do it,

32:47.633 --> 32:51.803
then maybe y'all would think,
my brothers and my sisters,

32:51.837 --> 32:53.339
-that you can do it,
-(cheering)

32:53.372 --> 32:56.108
and maybe you,
and maybe you could do it, too!

32:56.142 --> 33:00.846
But right now,
the Empire is under attack

33:00.879 --> 33:04.183
by an Uncle Tom
by the name of Eddie Barker,

33:04.216 --> 33:07.286
-(booing)
-who don't
give a damn about you!

33:07.319 --> 33:09.821
All he wants is your money!

33:11.823 --> 33:14.026
You see, once upon a time,

33:14.060 --> 33:15.694
Lucious and I didn't
have mothers,

33:15.727 --> 33:17.996
we didn't have fathers.

33:18.030 --> 33:22.168
All we had was each other...
and dreams, baby.

33:22.201 --> 33:24.002
(audience cheers)

33:26.838 --> 33:28.774
And I'm gonna tell y'all
something.

33:31.377 --> 33:34.680
Y'all made our dream come true.

33:34.713 --> 33:36.582
(cheering and applause)

33:36.615 --> 33:40.552
COOKIE: So if you want to
help us keep this Empire...

33:40.586 --> 33:41.587
AUDIENCE:
Yeah!

33:41.620 --> 33:42.688
You want the Empire to stay

33:42.721 --> 33:44.356
with the Lyon family?

33:44.390 --> 33:45.524
AUDIENCE:
Yeah!

33:45.557 --> 33:47.659
-With a black family?
-(cheering)

33:47.693 --> 33:50.362
-With your family?
-AUDIENCE: Yeah!

33:50.396 --> 33:52.198

check out our social media,

33:52.231 --> 33:54.900

33:54.933 --> 33:57.169
But please, only give

33:57.203 --> 33:58.570
We're not greedy.

33:58.604 --> 34:02.408
Now, who is ready to see

34:02.441 --> 34:06.678
the faces behind the most
incredible band in the country?

34:06.712 --> 34:10.616
For the first time ever
in public,

34:34.173 --> 34:38.910
We got the dopest guitar player
on the planet, Lonnie.

34:38.944 --> 34:42.581
We got Alex on horns,
and Ron on the ones and twos.

34:42.614 --> 34:44.316
And y'all all know my band.

34:44.350 --> 34:46.918
They've been with me

Nobody takes what's ours
from us.

We get it done, you and me.

39:13.018 --> 39:15.821
Together, unbeatable.

39:15.854 --> 39:20.058
I tell ya, I couldn't have done
none of it without you, Cookie.

39:20.091 --> 39:21.727
-None of it.
-Listen at you,

39:21.760 --> 39:24.262
sounding real drunk
and sappy right now.

39:24.295 --> 39:27.365
(laughs)
I needs me a drink.

39:27.399 --> 39:30.135
Now you sound like my woman.

39:32.471 --> 39:34.606
-Your woman?
-* And the darkest hour

39:34.640 --> 39:38.376
-Yeah.
-* Is just before dawn

39:40.779 --> 39:42.213
My woman.

39:42.247 --> 39:45.250
* Each night before...

39:45.283 --> 39:48.119
You know something?
Once upon a time,

39:48.153 --> 39:50.456
you made a mighty big
investment in me.

39:50.489 --> 39:53.459
And you paid big-time for it.

39:53.492 --> 39:58.096
I want you to know
I would trade this company

39:58.129 --> 40:00.466
and everything I've ever had

40:00.499 --> 40:02.634
to make sure I never
lose you again.

40:02.668 --> 40:03.935
* Ooh, baby

40:03.969 --> 40:06.772
* And let's tell

40:06.805 --> 40:09.307
* All the stars above...

40:09.340 --> 40:12.478
Well, I need you to know that
you raised my three boys

40:12.511 --> 40:16.081
into three kings,
and you built all of this.

40:16.114 --> 40:18.617
* To the one I love...

40:18.650 --> 40:23.789
And I have absolutely
no regrets, Lucious Lyon.

40:25.023 --> 40:27.793
(Lucious chuckles)

40:27.826 --> 40:32.397
* While I'm away

40:32.430 --> 40:34.399
COOKIE:
Mm, I've missed you so much.

40:34.432 --> 40:37.569
* Ooh, baby.

40:37.603 --> 40:38.737
(both chuckling)

40:38.770 --> 40:41.306
Excuse me, sir, ma'am.

40:41.339 --> 40:44.442
Mr. Barker and Miss Giselle
are here to see you.

40:44.476 --> 40:46.578
-Mm.
-Hmm. Like clockwork.

40:46.612 --> 40:49.014
This should be interesting.
Send them in, Juanita.

40:49.047 --> 40:50.649
-Okay.
-LUCIOUS: Mmm.

40:50.682 --> 40:51.917
It's good, right?

40:51.950 --> 40:53.318
LUCIOUS:
Yeah, it is.

40:53.351 --> 40:55.621
Well, well, well.
Good morning.

40:55.654 --> 40:57.489
-Good morning.
-Morning.

40:57.523 --> 40:59.525
So, are you here to concede
or beg for forgiveness?

40:59.558 --> 41:01.993
I would consider this
a courtesy call, Cookie.

41:02.027 --> 41:06.264
Courtesy? What do you know
about courtesy? Hmm?

41:06.297 --> 41:08.133
You show up to my house
at this hour

41:08.166 --> 41:09.868
like you just slid off a pole.

41:09.901 --> 41:11.302
-(Lucious laughs)
-I can still smell the aromas

41:11.336 --> 41:12.538
-of baby oil.
-(Lucious coughing)

41:12.571 --> 41:14.606
You choking
on the glitter, baby?

41:14.640 --> 41:15.707
Stop.

41:15.741 --> 41:18.309
EDDIE: I'm gonna give you
one last chance

41:18.343 --> 41:20.378
to save yourself, Lucious.

41:20.411 --> 41:22.814
-Oh, you gonna give me a chance?
-Mm.

41:22.848 --> 41:25.684
Maybe I shook you a little
harder than I thought.

41:25.717 --> 41:27.719
I don't think you shook him
hard enough.

41:27.753 --> 41:28.987
Is violence the only answer
around here?

41:29.020 --> 41:30.321
Is that,
is that all I can hear?

41:30.355 --> 41:33.124
-Sometimes.
-EDDIE: Sometimes.

41:33.158 --> 41:36.194
Oh, was it the answer for Shine?

41:36.227 --> 41:38.496
Hmm.

41:38.530 --> 41:40.532
Shine? Shine, you know,

41:40.566 --> 41:42.300
he was a victim
of his own mouth.

41:42.333 --> 41:44.502
He had a tendency of popping off
to a whole lot

41:44.536 --> 41:46.337
of different people
at the wrong time,

41:46.371 --> 41:47.673
and got popped.

41:47.706 --> 41:50.676
Yeah, loose lips sink ships.
You know that.

41:50.709 --> 41:53.912
You stood up there
and gave the eulogy.

41:53.945 --> 41:57.348
And I got to, I got to give it
to you, I almost fell for it.

41:57.382 --> 42:00.852
But you had that look.

42:02.588 --> 42:04.389
-That same old look.
-Oh, come on,

42:04.422 --> 42:05.490
Eddie, what you getting at?

42:05.523 --> 42:06.825
Spit it out, man.

42:06.858 --> 42:09.027
After the car bomb,

42:09.060 --> 42:14.933
with all your "new me"
mumbo jumbo, "Kumbaya,"

42:14.966 --> 42:16.501
you didn't change at all.

42:16.534 --> 42:18.203
You're still the same
Lucious Lyon.

42:18.236 --> 42:20.338
You're the same dude that I've
known for the last 20 years.

42:20.371 --> 42:22.574
You're the same thug

42:22.608 --> 42:26.477
whose talent is for violence.

42:29.114 --> 42:29.948
Then maybe you should go

42:29.981 --> 42:32.383
before I put that talent
to use, Eddie.

42:32.417 --> 42:34.820
I know you, Lucious Lyon.

42:37.322 --> 42:38.624
I know how you think,

42:38.657 --> 42:40.992
and I know how you dress.

42:42.661 --> 42:44.696
This is your scarf.

42:44.730 --> 42:49.334
You were wearing it the night
that you killed Shine.

42:52.403 --> 42:54.873
Your goons are disloyal,
Lucious.

42:54.906 --> 42:57.142
I open my checkbook,
they open their mouth.

42:57.175 --> 42:59.544
Oh, I'm sure that's
not all you opened.

42:59.577 --> 43:01.546
-You know what, Cookie?
-I would like to hear it.

43:01.579 --> 43:03.081
-Please.
-It's okay.

43:03.114 --> 43:04.716
It's okay.

43:04.750 --> 43:07.552
Either you withdraw your bid
for Empire,

43:07.585 --> 43:10.656
or I hand this over
to the police,

43:10.689 --> 43:14.592
and you spend the rest
of your life in prison.

43:15.526 --> 43:17.028
Your choice.

43:21.767 --> 43:23.168
Make the right one.

43:35.046 --> 43:38.183
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

44:09.881 --> 44:11.883
