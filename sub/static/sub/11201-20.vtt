00:12.879 --> 00:14.779
This vessel does not have a pool.

00:14.881 --> 00:17.679
I was talking about the gambling variety.

00:22.522 --> 00:24.615
I do not wish to speculate.

00:24.724 --> 00:26.419
Well, he said it was something important.

00:26.526 --> 00:27.857
You're not the least bit curious?

00:27.961 --> 00:30.828
Indeed, but I would not risk a wager.

00:36.903 --> 00:39.428
ALL: Surprise!

00:39.773 --> 00:41.934
(ALL CHEERING)

00:42.075 --> 00:43.770
It's not my birthday.

00:45.211 --> 00:46.678
(VALA LAUGHS AWKWARDLY)

00:48.415 --> 00:51.612
Hey, we made a weird cat-piсata thingy.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.549
I told you to bring something
to amuse yourself.

00:53.653 --> 00:55.917
I didn't mean me or the crew.

00:56.022 --> 00:59.014
Well, they won't believe that
it's my birthday... again.

00:59.125 --> 01:00.922
Not my problem.

01:01.027 --> 01:04.326
Being stuck on this ship is worse than
being stuck at the SGC!

01:04.431 --> 01:07.628
I tell you, the last time I was this bored,
I took hostages!

01:07.734 --> 01:09.099
I was there.

01:12.072 --> 01:15.405
- Major?
- We're approaching the coordinates, sir.

01:15.508 --> 01:16.873
Drop us out.

01:23.249 --> 01:24.580
We're being hailed.

01:24.684 --> 01:27.778
The Asgard are requesting permission
to beam aboard, sir.

01:27.887 --> 01:29.115
LANDRY: Granted.

01:33.293 --> 01:36.057
Greetings, and welcome to Orilla.

01:36.162 --> 01:37.390
Thor.

01:37.497 --> 01:39.795
Hello, Colonel Carter. It is good to see you.

01:40.233 --> 01:42.633
Out of curiosity,
how can you tell the difference?

01:42.735 --> 01:45.431
- The voice.
- It's good to see you, too, Thor.

01:45.538 --> 01:48.530
This is General Landry, Colonel Mitchell
and Vala.

01:48.641 --> 01:51.132
- Greetings.
- So, Thor, how you been?

01:51.244 --> 01:54.441
- Haven't heard from you in a while.
- I am sorry.

01:54.547 --> 01:57.015
I have been otherwise occupied.

01:57.117 --> 02:01.383
As mentioned in our communication,
the high council wishes to meet with you

02:01.488 --> 02:05.982
to explain in greater detail,
but there is not much time.

02:06.092 --> 02:08.788
General, with your permission,

02:08.895 --> 02:12.058
a number of Asgard are prepared
to beam aboard immediately

02:12.165 --> 02:15.532
to begin installing various technological
upgrades to this ship.

02:15.635 --> 02:18.798
I hope it's ray guns.
I got ray guns in the pool.

02:18.905 --> 02:21.100
What is it you're planning on giving us?

02:21.207 --> 02:23.300
Everything we have and know.

02:24.544 --> 02:26.774
- By that you mean...
- Everything.

02:26.880 --> 02:30.714
All our most current technology,
all our knowledge.

02:33.219 --> 02:38.555
Sorry, we're just a little stunned.
I mean, why are you doing this?

02:38.658 --> 02:41.559
You've always resisted in the past.
You always said we weren't ready.

02:41.661 --> 02:44.755
Indeed. Many Asgard still believe that.

02:45.398 --> 02:47.127
So, what's changed?

02:47.634 --> 02:50.034
As a race, we are dying.

02:50.603 --> 02:54.369
Very soon, we will all be gone.

04:04.944 --> 04:06.241
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

04:09.249 --> 04:13.015
The Asgard computer core is equipped
with its own power source

04:13.119 --> 04:15.986
that will not infringe on your ship's ZPM.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.250
However, when the upgrades
are complete,

04:18.725 --> 04:21.888
the core will be fully integrated
into all the ship's systems.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.895
There must be something more
you can do.

04:23.997 --> 04:27.990
I assure you, we are providing you
with all the latest Asgard technology,

04:28.101 --> 04:31.537
as well as a knowledge base
including our entire recorded history.

04:31.638 --> 04:33.299
That's not what I was talking about.

04:33.406 --> 04:36.705
Everything that can be done
has been done.

04:37.510 --> 04:41.276
The final attempt to solve
our physiological degeneration

04:41.381 --> 04:44.817
has left each of us with
a rapidly progressing disease.

04:45.251 --> 04:46.650
It really wasn't an option for them.

04:46.753 --> 04:50.450
They made the choice to extend their life
through science generations ago.

04:50.556 --> 04:53.389
It took any natural physiological evolution
necessary for Ascension

04:53.493 --> 04:54.687
out of the equation.

04:54.794 --> 04:56.318
They are planning on ending their lives

04:56.429 --> 04:59.830
before the degeneration
they're suffering from goes too far.

04:59.932 --> 05:01.900
- Mass suicide?
- They don't want any of their knowledge

05:02.001 --> 05:03.935
or technology
falling into the wrong hands.

05:04.037 --> 05:06.369
And they wanted us to witness the event.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.633
So everything they've installed
on this ship...

05:08.741 --> 05:10.174
Is going to be their legacy.

05:15.648 --> 05:18.412
If you like, you will be able to interface
with the core

05:18.518 --> 05:20.918
using a holographic representation of me

05:21.020 --> 05:23.750
or any other Asgard on record
in the knowledge base.

05:23.856 --> 05:25.790
I'm sorry, but that just won't be the same.

05:25.892 --> 05:29.350
I have been working on this for
the better part of a year, Colonel Carter.

05:29.462 --> 05:31.362
And we appreciate it, really.

05:31.464 --> 05:35.332
Many on the council did not believe we
should be imparting such advancements.

05:35.435 --> 05:38.563
Well, I promise we will do our very best
not to let you down.

05:38.671 --> 05:40.832
You are the fifth race.

05:41.507 --> 05:43.566
Your role is clear.

05:44.077 --> 05:50.038
If there is any hope in preserving the
future, it lies with you and your people.

05:50.817 --> 05:52.444
No pressure, huh?

05:52.919 --> 05:56.946
You have earned my respect
and my friendship.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.583
Well, the feeling is mutual.

06:01.828 --> 06:03.989
Please do not be sad.

06:04.097 --> 06:06.895
The end of my people has been
a long time coming.

06:06.999 --> 06:10.799
We have made too many irreversible
mistakes in our development.

06:10.903 --> 06:13.736
Hopefully, you can learn something
from it.

06:13.840 --> 06:17.037
My only regret is that
our physical weakness

06:17.143 --> 06:20.078
has left us incapable
of helping you further.

06:26.119 --> 06:26.219
(SIREN BLARING)

06:26.219 --> 06:27.880
(SIREN BLARING)

06:28.154 --> 06:30.850
Sir, three Ori mother ships
just dropped out of hyperspace

06:30.957 --> 06:33.221
and are approaching the planet.

06:34.927 --> 06:37.794
<i>LANDRY: Colonel, this is the bridge.</i>
<i>We have three contacts.</i>

06:37.897 --> 06:39.888
<i>Ori mother ships bearing down.</i>

06:39.999 --> 06:43.662
Sir, the hyperdrive is still offline,
diverting power to the shields.

06:43.770 --> 06:45.260
You must go.

06:50.443 --> 06:52.502
Sir, the Asgard just disembarked.

06:52.612 --> 06:55.172
It'll take a few minutes to get
the hyperdrive back online.

06:55.281 --> 06:58.216
- Full sublight. Get us clear of the planet.
- Full sublight.

07:05.358 --> 07:06.848
(RUMBLING)

07:07.994 --> 07:09.689
Shields are down to 83%.

07:09.796 --> 07:11.821
How the hell did they find us?

07:14.033 --> 07:16.263
Some reason we're not jumping
to hyperspace?

07:16.369 --> 07:17.529
Carter's working on it.

07:17.637 --> 07:21.971
Sir, sensors are detecting a massive
build-up of energy coming from the planet.

07:22.074 --> 07:23.939
Everyone hold on tight!

07:38.424 --> 07:40.756
- Shields are down to 50%.
- Colonel!

07:40.860 --> 07:44.318
Sir, the hyperdrive is now online,
but we have to get clear of the radiation

07:44.430 --> 07:47.024
caused by the explosion
before we can make the jump safely.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.998
How about the Asgard energy weapons?

07:49.101 --> 07:50.762
But they haven't been tested yet, sir.

07:54.807 --> 07:56.570
Shields are down to 28%.

07:56.676 --> 07:59.406
At maximum sublight,
we're 47 seconds to get clear.

07:59.512 --> 08:00.672
We're not going to make it.

08:00.780 --> 08:03.442
Let's see what these new Asgard upgrades
are made of.

08:03.549 --> 08:04.846
Come about.

08:11.524 --> 08:13.492
Power the energy weapons.

08:14.427 --> 08:16.520
Energy weapons are powered.

08:17.363 --> 08:18.421
Fire.

08:22.602 --> 08:24.536
Sensors indicate enemy shields
are fluctuating.

08:24.637 --> 08:25.604
Keep firing!

08:33.513 --> 08:34.775
I'll be damned.

08:35.915 --> 08:37.280
We got them.

08:37.617 --> 08:38.709
MAN: Copy that, sir.

08:38.851 --> 08:41.251
- Get us into hyperspace.
- Yes, sir.

08:49.996 --> 08:52.089
Run another diagnostic.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.223
Colonel, how's that report coming?

08:54.333 --> 08:57.393
I want to be able to brief the President
as soon as we get back.

08:57.503 --> 08:59.232
He's going to want to know
how quickly we can duplicate

08:59.338 --> 09:01.067
this new Asgard weaponry.

09:01.173 --> 09:04.404
I'm working on it, sir,
but something else has come up.

09:04.510 --> 09:08.344
The hyperdrive diagnostic is spitting out
some data that's concerning me.

09:08.447 --> 09:10.608
We took some damage
that's causing a problem?

09:10.716 --> 09:13.708
I think we need to drop out
and run a few tests, just to be sure.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.256
Sir, two contacts just appeared
on sensors.

09:23.362 --> 09:25.762
Mother ships, Ori, closing fast.

09:32.939 --> 09:34.839
Colonel,
given we've already taken damage,

09:34.941 --> 09:36.966
I'd rather not take on two more ships.

09:37.109 --> 09:38.440
(RUMBLING)

09:43.082 --> 09:44.913
<i>CARTER: Sir, the hyperdrive is back online.</i>

09:45.017 --> 09:47.485
- Get us back into hyperspace.
- Yes, sir.

09:51.524 --> 09:53.719
It's a hell of a coincidence,
don't you think?

09:53.826 --> 09:56.989
Well, unless they were tracking us
and just waiting for us to drop out.

09:57.096 --> 09:59.394
I thought they couldn't track us
in hyperspace.

09:59.498 --> 10:01.966
Unless it was the Ori themselves
tipping off the Priors.

10:02.068 --> 10:03.968
JACKSON: We've already passed back
into the Milky Way.

10:04.070 --> 10:06.129
As far as we know,
the Ancients should have a problem

10:06.238 --> 10:08.968
with the Ori using their Ascended powers
right under their noses.

10:09.075 --> 10:10.133
As far as we know.

10:10.242 --> 10:12.904
At least we now have weapons
we know will destroy an Ori ship.

10:13.012 --> 10:16.004
Well, that's not going to do us any good
if they can track us wherever we go.

10:16.115 --> 10:17.980
I mean, eventually, the <i>Odyssey's</i>
going to come up against

10:18.084 --> 10:19.312
more than she can handle.

10:19.418 --> 10:23.047
Is it possible the Priors can detect the new
technology given to us by the Asgard

10:23.155 --> 10:24.554
without the help of the Ori?

10:24.657 --> 10:26.454
I suppose the new power source
could be giving off

10:26.559 --> 10:30.086
some sort of unique energy signature
that's detectable from subspace.

10:30.196 --> 10:31.823
However,
without further experimentation,

10:31.931 --> 10:33.796
the only way to find out is to shut it off

10:33.899 --> 10:36.026
and see if that stops the Ori
from following us.

10:36.135 --> 10:37.261
Do it.

10:37.370 --> 10:39.998
The problem with that, sir,
is that the new Asgard core

10:40.106 --> 10:42.734
is currently tied into every system
on this ship.

10:42.842 --> 10:45.640
We would have to drop out of hyperspace
and isolate the core

10:45.745 --> 10:49.442
from the hyperdrive controls,
and that could take some time.

10:56.589 --> 10:58.716
Sir, two contacts just appeared
on sensors.

10:58.824 --> 11:00.314
Son of a bitch.

11:00.893 --> 11:02.417
(RUMBLING)

11:03.162 --> 11:04.151
Shields are down to 53%.

11:04.263 --> 11:05.230
(SIREN BLARING)

11:05.331 --> 11:08.664
Reports of damage front and rear,
levels two, six, and ten.

11:08.768 --> 11:10.599
Evasive maneuvers. Fire at will!

11:10.703 --> 11:14.002
We already took out one ship.
What's another two, right?

11:16.175 --> 11:18.609
Colonel! I need the hyperdrive now!

11:21.781 --> 11:24.272
Go ahead, sir. Hyperdrive is online.

11:35.494 --> 11:37.086
We're going to need at least half an hour

11:37.196 --> 11:39.596
to get the hyperdrive system
separated from the core.

11:40.066 --> 11:43.331
We must assume the Ori ships will
continue to engage us whenever we stop.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.961
Is there a planet with a stargate nearby?

11:50.109 --> 11:52.634
Yes, sir. P3X-474.

11:52.745 --> 11:55.612
It's uninhabited.
We should get there in just under an hour.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.876
We might make it
before the hyperdrive fails.

11:57.983 --> 11:59.143
And what?

11:59.251 --> 12:01.276
Beam to the surface and gate home.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.617
We can't let this ship fall
into enemy hands.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.691
That's what the self-destruct is for.

12:05.791 --> 12:07.224
Whoa, wait a minute, sir.

12:07.326 --> 12:10.090
If you're talking about destroying the ship,

12:10.196 --> 12:12.664
we can't sacrifice the knowledge base
of the Asgard.

12:12.765 --> 12:14.528
They trusted us with their legacy.

12:14.633 --> 12:18.194
Dr. Jackson, this is not something
I'm considering lightly.

12:18.304 --> 12:20.568
I'm assuming
we can't take any of it with us.

12:20.673 --> 12:22.868
No, sir.
The core is too big to fit through the gate.

12:22.975 --> 12:24.875
Well, I for one am willing to stay
and put up a fight.

12:24.977 --> 12:27.810
- I think it's worth it.
- Get us to 474.

12:27.913 --> 12:30.074
We'll beam the crew down to the surface.

12:30.182 --> 12:34.175
Hopefully, there'll be enough time for
them to gate home before the Ori attack.

12:34.286 --> 12:35.753
And then what?

12:36.455 --> 12:40.824
I said it before, I am for fighting
to the death, but we need a plan,

12:40.926 --> 12:43.360
preferably one that avoids
the "to the death" part.

12:43.462 --> 12:45.953
We have an hour to come up with one.

12:46.565 --> 12:50.057
I think I may have a way of buying us
a little more time.

13:08.888 --> 13:10.219
Here they come.

13:10.356 --> 13:12.620
Shields at maximum. Evasive maneuvers.

13:12.725 --> 13:16.286
Concentrate fire on only one target,
one at a time.

13:16.462 --> 13:17.793
(RUMBLING)

13:19.765 --> 13:21.790
Okay, that was not good.

13:21.901 --> 13:23.562
Shields are down to 23%.

13:23.669 --> 13:25.261
We're hitting them with everything
we've got.

13:50.763 --> 13:53.755
- Shields are offline!
- One more hit will take us out.

13:53.866 --> 13:55.356
Colonel Carter!

14:25.331 --> 14:29.631
Thanks to Asgard technology,
we are in a time-dilation bubble.

14:29.735 --> 14:32.295
While time may appear to be passing
at a normal rate for us,

14:32.404 --> 14:34.565
in fact, years will pass inside the bubble

14:34.673 --> 14:37.369
while mere fractions of a second
pass outside the field.

14:37.476 --> 14:39.000
You won't need that much time, though?

14:39.111 --> 14:40.078
Hopefully not.

14:40.179 --> 14:43.046
My plan is to try to make the necessary
modifications to the <i>Odyssey</i>

14:43.148 --> 14:44.638
so that we can take it out of phase.

14:44.750 --> 14:47.719
Then when we shut down the
time-dilation field, the blast won't hit us.

14:47.820 --> 14:48.844
That would be good.

14:48.954 --> 14:51.320
You're probably wondering
why I didn't just do that in the first place.

14:51.423 --> 14:53.721
I'm still back on the time thing.

14:54.560 --> 14:58.553
The Asgard core has time-dilation
field technology built right into it.

14:58.664 --> 15:01.155
It was a quick and easy option.

15:01.267 --> 15:05.067
I'm actually going to have to recreate
some of Merlin's out-of-phase technology

15:05.170 --> 15:09.800
from scratch with what we have onboard,
and it could take a while.

15:09.909 --> 15:13.037
Just to be sure,
how long is "a while" in our time?

15:13.145 --> 15:14.669
I'm not exactly sure.

15:14.780 --> 15:17.772
But we have enough food and water
for three months.

15:19.785 --> 15:22.379
- Three months?
- We can ration supplies.

15:24.256 --> 15:27.453
(WHISPERING) I'm going to go crazy,
and I'm taking you with me.

15:27.559 --> 15:30.426
Of course, if it takes a little longer...

15:30.529 --> 15:33.862
Oh, whoa. Longer than three months?

15:34.333 --> 15:36.961
Bottom line is none of you are
going to have any excuse

15:37.069 --> 15:39.503
for being behind on your paperwork.

15:40.539 --> 15:41.801
(CHUCKLES)

15:54.887 --> 15:57.082
<i>That function is not possible.</i>

16:35.728 --> 16:37.491
VALA: Do you think the Ori warriors
could have found a way

16:37.596 --> 16:40.895
to get through the time-dilation field
and over here onto the ship?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.024
No.

16:42.134 --> 16:44.125
Because I'm hearing things all the time.

16:44.236 --> 16:47.535
- Are you hearing things?
- I am trying not to.

16:47.639 --> 16:49.004
Maybe they found a way to ring over,

16:49.108 --> 16:51.838
but they can't figure out how to
secretly shut off the time-dilation field,

16:51.944 --> 16:55.402
so they're trying to drive us crazy
and make us shut it down ourselves.

16:55.514 --> 16:58.005
- No.
- That wasn't a question.

16:59.818 --> 17:00.944
No.

17:04.223 --> 17:06.987
Before I tried to build
Merlin's out-of-phase technology,

17:07.092 --> 17:09.458
I decided to run a simulation.

17:12.431 --> 17:15.730
Are you saying it took two weeks
to figure out this idea wouldn't work?

17:15.868 --> 17:18.098
I'm sorry.
I've been trying to adjust the parameters.

17:18.203 --> 17:20.103
Now, the problem is, according to Thor,

17:20.205 --> 17:24.403
I can't seem to take the ship out of phase
before I shut down the field.

17:24.510 --> 17:26.478
And once we deactivate
the time-dilation field,

17:26.578 --> 17:29.911
we have.86 seconds
before the blast hits us,

17:30.015 --> 17:32.245
and that just isn't enough time
to take the ship out of phase.

17:32.351 --> 17:33.716
Okay, time for plan B.

17:33.819 --> 17:36.515
Actually, I ran that simulation, too.

17:37.689 --> 17:41.750
If we beam ourselves into the buffer,
ready to transport down to the planet,

17:41.860 --> 17:45.694
and set the time-dilation field
to deactivate on a timer,

17:45.798 --> 17:49.325
the matter stream still doesn't have
enough time to fully exit the buffer

17:49.435 --> 17:50.959
and get clear of the explosion.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.095
Fine, plan C. We go to the 302s.

17:53.205 --> 17:55.673
- That's how I got off the <i>Korelev.</i>
- Ran that, too.

17:55.774 --> 17:59.266
Based on the way the <i>Odyssey</i> is going
to be hit compared to the <i>Korelev,</i>

17:59.378 --> 18:01.107
it won't work.

18:01.213 --> 18:02.942
The computer's wrong.

18:03.048 --> 18:05.346
Both of the last two scenarios
don't preserve the ship

18:05.451 --> 18:06.918
or the Asgard knowledge.

18:07.019 --> 18:07.986
I know.

18:08.087 --> 18:12.046
- Okay, it's only been a couple of weeks.
- I have a problem with the word "only".

18:12.157 --> 18:13.124
CARTER: The good news is

18:13.225 --> 18:16.752
the Asgard have provided us
with some truly amazing technology.

18:16.862 --> 18:20.423
- Just nothing to get us out of this mess.
- I don't know that yet.

18:20.532 --> 18:24.024
However, with only a slight modification
to the beaming technology,

18:24.136 --> 18:26.502
we have a matter converter
that will literally allow us

18:26.605 --> 18:30.666
to manufacture food, water, oxygen,
pretty much anything we need.

18:30.776 --> 18:33.370
Except a way off this ship.

18:33.479 --> 18:35.538
You've made your point, son.

18:35.647 --> 18:40.050
I doubt very much Colonel Carter has even
scratched the surface of what's possible.

18:40.152 --> 18:42.347
Let's give her some more time.

19:49.521 --> 19:52.854
I mean, all they wanted to do
was live a little longer.

19:52.958 --> 19:57.452
We're no different.
Sequence DNA, cure diseases.

19:57.563 --> 20:01.465
And one fatal mistake
and they doom their entire race.

20:02.301 --> 20:07.762
I guess no matter what you do,
at the end of the day, life is too short.

20:09.474 --> 20:10.941
I agree.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.022
What are you doing?

20:24.122 --> 20:27.057
Something we should have done
a long time ago.

20:28.493 --> 20:30.620
- Don't do that.
- Why not?

20:38.737 --> 20:43.333
We've been here three months, Daniel.
Three months.

20:45.310 --> 20:48.211
- You do like girls?
- Yes!

20:49.314 --> 20:52.841
Well, I don't see many other options
around here, do you?

20:54.987 --> 21:00.857
Unless you really don't find me attractive?

21:01.893 --> 21:04.191
Do you want an honest answer
to that question?

21:04.296 --> 21:05.263
No.

21:05.364 --> 21:06.456
No, seriously. You started this.

21:06.565 --> 21:08.362
Do you want an honest answer
to the question?

21:08.467 --> 21:10.025
No, don't worry about it.

21:10.135 --> 21:14.128
Do you believe I could have
any kind of serious feelings for you?

21:17.175 --> 21:21.236
I wasn't suggesting
you have serious feelings, Daniel.

21:21.346 --> 21:24.713
Oh. Oh, what? So, what?
We sleep together once, then what?

21:24.816 --> 21:26.909
We work together.

21:27.019 --> 21:30.011
You know, even saying that part out loud
sounds unbelievable.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.317
I mean... Come on!

21:32.424 --> 21:36.622
I mean, I can't even imagine what
a relationship with you would be like.

21:36.728 --> 21:41.665
I mean, yes. Yes, you've proven yourself
to be trustworthy on a professional level,

21:41.767 --> 21:45.567
and for that I am very proud of you,
but on a personal level?

21:45.971 --> 21:48.462
Vala, come on, give me a break!

21:48.573 --> 21:52.236
I mean, at best,
you're an emotional, unstable wreck.

21:52.344 --> 21:55.541
I'm not saying I'm much better.
I'm not saying I'm much better.

21:55.647 --> 21:59.640
There was a time when I thought
I would never get over my wife.

21:59.751 --> 22:00.843
I mean, the idea of

22:02.954 --> 22:04.478
being hurt that way again...

22:04.589 --> 22:05.920
But I have finally gotten to the place.

22:06.024 --> 22:08.549
I finally, for the first time in a long time,
have gotten to the place

22:08.660 --> 22:11.857
where I actually feel I could get close
to somebody again.

22:11.963 --> 22:15.797
But not in a million years,
a million, million years,

22:15.901 --> 22:19.268
would I ever possibly consider
that person being you.

22:19.838 --> 22:24.775
I mean, we are so completely opposite
and wrong for each other,

22:24.876 --> 22:27.868
it's not even funny, and the worst part,
the worst part about that is

22:27.979 --> 22:29.241
you know that!

22:29.348 --> 22:32.715
And this whole flirty,
sexual thing that you do,

22:32.818 --> 22:36.379
that's just your way of having a laugh
at my expense.

22:36.488 --> 22:39.116
So, I'm so sorry
if I'm not more appreciative of that,

22:39.224 --> 22:44.127
and I'm so sorry that you're bored,
but don't you pretend it's anything else.

22:52.270 --> 22:54.329
Don't act like you're hurt.

23:15.160 --> 23:17.287
- Hey.
- Just give me a minute.

23:18.897 --> 23:20.262
Look at me.

23:51.463 --> 23:53.954
You better not be messing with me.

24:20.158 --> 24:21.489
General,

24:23.595 --> 24:26.621
we need to take our chances
with the F-302s.

24:26.731 --> 24:28.892
What I need is a sun lamp.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.163
This matter-converted oxygen
just isn't the same.

24:33.338 --> 24:37.172
Oh, why is the grand irony of this lost
on everyone but me?

24:37.275 --> 24:38.640
It's not.

24:39.911 --> 24:42.379
Sir, at this point,
we know it's the damn Asgard upgrades

24:42.481 --> 24:44.608
that allow the Ori to track us.

24:44.716 --> 24:47.810
So even if we manage to save the ship,
we won't be able to use the technology,

24:47.919 --> 24:51.753
because the Ori will come down on us
like a bag of hammers.

24:51.857 --> 24:53.518
For now.

24:53.625 --> 24:56.355
Oh, come on, sir. It's like a bad joke.

24:56.461 --> 25:00.557
We have stranded ourselves here
trying to save something we can't use.

25:00.665 --> 25:03.327
I'm not having this conversation again.

25:27.158 --> 25:28.853
I want to help you.

25:35.600 --> 25:38.831
The problem is that there isn't enough
time to shut off the time-dilation field

25:38.937 --> 25:40.996
- and start a new process.
- I know.

25:41.106 --> 25:43.939
- I'm just thinking out loud here.
- I know.

25:44.042 --> 25:47.478
- What is that thing?
- Oh. It's a cello.

25:47.579 --> 25:50.241
I've always wanted to learn how to play.

25:52.117 --> 25:55.484
Is it possible to use the time-dilation
technology to solve our problem?

25:55.587 --> 25:59.489
- How?
- Well, obviously, it would...

26:00.258 --> 26:01.657
Sorry.

26:01.760 --> 26:03.819
Obviously, it would be great
if we could go back in time

26:03.929 --> 26:07.160
and not get into this situation
in the first place.

26:07.265 --> 26:10.359
Well, slowing down time
within a localized field

26:10.468 --> 26:14.427
is not even close to the same thing
as reversing time altogether.

26:15.140 --> 26:16.698
It's a good thought, though.

26:16.808 --> 26:23.213
See, what we need is we need Superman
to fly around the ship really, really fast.

26:23.915 --> 26:26.076
Oh, if you only knew
how ridiculous that was.

26:26.184 --> 26:28.709
No, it only sounds ridiculous
till you hear yourself say,

26:28.820 --> 26:33.189
"I am trapped on a spaceship
stuck in a time-dilation field."

26:41.399 --> 26:43.594
<i>(HA VE YOU EVER SEEN</i>
<i>THE RAIN?</i> PLAYING)

27:38.790 --> 27:41.691
<i>That function is not possible.</i>

27:44.295 --> 27:48.561
- I hate this ship.
- You're a pilot, you love flying.

27:48.667 --> 27:52.125
And fighter. This is not flying.
This is literally standing still.

27:52.237 --> 27:55.206
This is <i>The Love Boat</i>
without the buffet and the band.

27:55.306 --> 27:59.436
Besides, I only liked flying so much
because I didn't know about the Stargate.

28:49.027 --> 28:51.518
<i>That function is not possible.</i>

29:10.782 --> 29:12.272

29:42.080 --> 29:43.945
Twenty years today.

29:47.519 --> 29:49.749
Still think life is too short?

30:37.569 --> 30:39.730
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:49.147 --> 30:50.774
Why do you do it?

30:51.549 --> 30:54.950
Knowing everything you learn is
going to die with you?

30:57.121 --> 30:59.146
I know you guys all think I'm crazy,

31:00.391 --> 31:04.054
but the truth is, if I stop, I'll go crazy.

31:06.231 --> 31:08.426
Besides, you haven't given up.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.233
Yes, I have.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.472
Stop it.

31:23.915 --> 31:26.816
- I can't, I'm sorry.
- It wasn't your fault.

31:29.821 --> 31:32.153
We all would have died long ago if...

31:32.824 --> 31:34.553
If you hadn't done what you did.

31:48.439 --> 31:49.929
Don't give up.

32:36.721 --> 32:38.052
(MUMBLING)

32:54.339 --> 32:57.536
When I said that I wanted to get
the team back together,

32:57.642 --> 33:00.110
work with you guys, learn from you,

33:03.247 --> 33:07.877
I did not mean every waking moment
for the next 50 years.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.920
You said that yesterday.

33:10.755 --> 33:12.188
I did?

33:12.290 --> 33:16.249
- And the day before.
- And the day before that.

33:16.928 --> 33:19.021
Oh. Sorry.

33:19.464 --> 33:22.194
I'll just shut up now.

33:22.967 --> 33:25.959
No, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said anything.

33:30.041 --> 33:31.303
I did it.

33:34.445 --> 33:35.878
You did what?

33:36.581 --> 33:40.017
I figured out how to reverse time
in a localized field.

33:45.690 --> 33:46.782
What?

33:49.394 --> 33:51.055
What's the matter?

33:51.162 --> 33:54.154
Maintaining the time-dilation field
for all this time

33:54.265 --> 33:56.927
has almost completely depleted the ZPM

33:57.035 --> 33:59.629
and the power source in the Asgard core.

33:59.737 --> 34:02.228
We don't have enough power
to make it work?

34:02.340 --> 34:04.331
There's irony for you, huh?

34:05.910 --> 34:10.677
I create the field to buy us more time,
I finally figure out how to undo it all,

34:10.782 --> 34:13.808
and that extra time
is what makes it impossible.

34:13.918 --> 34:15.317
Are you sure?

34:15.420 --> 34:18.446
I mean, if you had some more time,
could you...

34:19.023 --> 34:20.285
I'm sure.

34:20.591 --> 34:21.819
Hey, Sam.

34:22.960 --> 34:26.259
Do you remember
when we were stuck out of phase?

34:26.798 --> 34:28.095
Which time?

34:28.199 --> 34:30.133
When you got shot and you thought
you were going to die

34:30.234 --> 34:32.998
and the Ori were going
to destroy that village.

34:33.104 --> 34:34.366
Vaguely.

34:34.472 --> 34:38.101
You had me use the power source
from an Ori staff weapon

34:38.209 --> 34:40.177
to power Merlin's device.

34:41.746 --> 34:45.079
We don't have anything even close
to a power source

34:45.183 --> 34:49.779
that would be required to keep a reverse
time field working for long enough.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.184
Really?

34:56.027 --> 34:57.494
Come with me.

35:04.335 --> 35:05.893
What about that?

35:13.711 --> 35:17.272
That? There's no way we...

35:21.819 --> 35:23.514
There's no way to absorb the blast

35:23.621 --> 35:26.249
and channel the energy
into the Asgard core...

35:26.357 --> 35:27.619
Unless?

35:27.725 --> 35:32.560
Unless we reroute the power conduits
throughout the ship into the core

35:32.663 --> 35:34.927
and let the blast hit us.

35:35.032 --> 35:37.523
- This ship will explode.
- Yes.

35:38.102 --> 35:42.471
But hopefully enough energy from
the blast will be channeled into the core

35:42.573 --> 35:45.303
to allow it to activate
the reverse time field

35:45.409 --> 35:47.377
before everything is totally destroyed.

35:47.478 --> 35:48.877
But we'll be dead.

35:48.980 --> 35:52.746
If this works, we'll only be dead
for a few milliseconds.

35:52.850 --> 35:54.750
Then time within the bubble will reverse,

35:54.852 --> 35:57.719
and we won't be dead
and the ship won't be destroyed.

35:57.822 --> 35:59.221
If this works.

35:59.690 --> 36:02.352
Yes. I'm not promising anything.

36:02.593 --> 36:06.290
It's all right, it's a shot,
and I say we take it.

36:07.365 --> 36:08.957
How far back can we go?

36:09.066 --> 36:09.167
Only to the point where
the time-dilation field was created.

36:09.167 --> 36:12.466
Only to the point where
the time-dilation field was created.

36:12.570 --> 36:15.471
We can't reverse time
for the entire universe.

36:15.573 --> 36:17.507
If we go back any further than that,

36:17.608 --> 36:20.168
we are outside of normal time-space again

36:20.278 --> 36:23.372
and we create a paradox
that the technology couldn't handle.

36:23.481 --> 36:25.676
Is that going to be good enough?

36:25.783 --> 36:29.549
I might be able to buy us
a little more time, maybe a minute.

36:29.687 --> 36:30.654
But

36:32.924 --> 36:35.392
one of us is going to have to stay old.

36:35.493 --> 36:36.755
- Oh.
- Oh.

36:36.861 --> 36:40.262
We're talking about reversing time
within the field.

36:40.364 --> 36:45.199
Everything, our age,
our memories, will be undone.

36:45.303 --> 36:47.771
If this works,
we'll be doomed to repeat history.

36:47.872 --> 36:50.204
Unless we can exclude someone
from the field

36:50.308 --> 36:52.367
who can steer events in another direction.

36:52.476 --> 36:56.378
You created the time-dilation field

36:56.480 --> 36:59.813
to prevent us from being hit
by that blast in the first place.

36:59.917 --> 37:02.442
- You had no choice.
- All right.

37:02.553 --> 37:06.649
We have to sever the Asgard core
from the hyperdrive controls,

37:06.757 --> 37:08.725
or else the Ori will be able to follow us

37:08.826 --> 37:11.090
when we make the jump into hyperspace.

37:11.195 --> 37:15.655
A long time ago, in the event
that I ever did solve the time issue,

37:15.766 --> 37:19.133
I created a program that would achieve
that very quickly.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.467
I'll load it onto a crystal.

37:21.572 --> 37:25.269
That way, it will only take me
a few seconds to shut down the core

37:25.376 --> 37:27.003
and make the jump into hyperspace.

37:27.111 --> 37:29.545
Who says it's going to be you?

37:29.647 --> 37:32.115
Well, it makes sense that it be me.

37:33.451 --> 37:34.884
I will do it.

37:37.488 --> 37:39.888
Teal'c, you've lost as many years
as the rest of us.

37:39.991 --> 37:42.152
MITCHELL: What are you, 130 now?

37:42.260 --> 37:45.058
I don't know.
He doesn't look a day over 120 to me.

37:45.162 --> 37:49.565
I have many more years to live
and I am the only logical choice.

37:49.667 --> 37:50.634
Teal'c.

37:50.735 --> 37:53.226
I have but one question.

37:53.337 --> 37:55.271
If this should not work...

37:56.140 --> 38:00.804
Then the shields will fail and
you will die along with the rest of us.

38:04.849 --> 38:06.544
Then it is settled.

38:10.921 --> 38:15.221
I want you to know,
even if you are going to forget,

38:16.460 --> 38:18.325
that I wasn't with you all these years

38:18.429 --> 38:22.525
because we were trapped
on this God-awful ship.

38:24.168 --> 38:26.636
- I was with you because...
- I know.

38:28.606 --> 38:33.066
- And I want you to know that I...
- I know. I know.

38:37.948 --> 38:41.543
<i>- CARTER: I'm ready.</i>
- Do it, Sam.

39:27.832 --> 39:29.231
(SIREN BLARING)

39:29.333 --> 39:32.063
- Shields are offline!
- One more hit will take us out.

39:32.169 --> 39:33.693
Colonel Carter!

39:38.309 --> 39:40.368
Teal'c, what are you doing?

39:56.727 --> 39:59.560
Oh, come on! It's driving me insane.

39:59.663 --> 40:04.066
You know, technically, there would be
no danger of creating a time paradox

40:04.168 --> 40:06.432
because we've already changed
future events.

40:06.537 --> 40:10.132
You would not be altering the future
by telling us about something

40:10.241 --> 40:12.141
that's not going to happen anymore.

40:12.243 --> 40:16.111
- Then why do you care?
- Fifty or 60 years?

40:16.213 --> 40:18.909
Something interesting
must have happened.

40:20.284 --> 40:22.775
Obviously I hooked up with someone.

40:25.389 --> 40:27.118
Was it you, Muscles?

40:30.027 --> 40:34.464
It can't have been Mitchell, can it?
General Landry?

40:39.637 --> 40:42.401
- Dial it up, Walter.
- Yes, sir.

40:51.849 --> 40:53.146
Chevron one, encoded.

40:57.121 --> 40:59.180
MITCHELL: That is how
we're supposed to travel

40:59.290 --> 41:02.851
light years across the galaxy
to other planets.

41:02.960 --> 41:04.791
Chevron two, encoded.

41:07.198 --> 41:09.393
You know, I'd like to think
that I handled myself well,

41:09.500 --> 41:14.597
but I imagine I went a bit crazy
cooped up on that ship for so long.

41:14.738 --> 41:16.228
Chevron three, encoded.

41:16.340 --> 41:19.969
You know, Teal'c did tell me some things
I learned from the Asgard knowledge base.

41:20.077 --> 41:22.875
He did? Like what?

41:22.980 --> 41:25.244
Oh, boy. What were they?

41:25.349 --> 41:26.782
<i>HARRIMAN: Chevron four, encoded.</i>

41:26.917 --> 41:28.817
"Beggars can't be choosers.

41:28.919 --> 41:30.409
"Better late than never.

41:30.521 --> 41:32.580
"Look before you leap."

41:32.690 --> 41:35.124
"The best things in life are free."

41:35.226 --> 41:38.195
And let me guess,
"Beauty is only skin deep?"

41:38.295 --> 41:40.354
"Silence is golden."

41:41.232 --> 41:42.597
Chevron five, encoded.

41:42.700 --> 41:44.725
"Jack of all trades, master of none."

41:44.835 --> 41:47.395
"Nothing ventured, nothing gained."

41:47.505 --> 41:48.972
"Life is too short."

41:52.276 --> 41:54.506
Chevron six, encoded.

41:55.679 --> 41:58.239
"Good things come to those who wait."

41:59.717 --> 42:03.312
You know, as hard as it is
for us not knowing,

42:03.420 --> 42:06.253
it must be torture for you not to tell us.

42:11.228 --> 42:12.388
Indeed.

42:17.501 --> 42:20.299
Chevron seven is locked.

42:25.509 --> 42:27.033
<i>Good luck, SG-1.</i>

42:28.345 --> 42:31.746
Just another everyday mission
to save the galaxy, sir.

42:32.116 --> 42:33.344
ALL: Indeed.

42:38.923 --> 42:40.151
<i>Godspeed.</i>
