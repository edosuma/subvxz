03:03.374 --> 03:05.458
[yelling]

05:02.284 --> 05:03.868
[yells]

07:13.457 --> 07:17.460
He's never belonged to anyone
for more than five years.

07:21.924 --> 07:24.008
Your time has passed.

07:26.970 --> 07:29.055
Mine has come.

12:04.372 --> 12:07.249
[man] They're bastards, these people.

12:10.295 --> 12:12.630
These followers of the white Christ.

12:13.924 --> 12:15.382
Bastards.

12:18.345 --> 12:24.099
A much travelled man once told me
that they eat their own God.

12:27.103 --> 12:29.271
Eat his flesh, drink his blood.

12:31.650 --> 12:33.108
Abominable.

12:35.862 --> 12:40.074
And they hate us... want us dead.

12:45.288 --> 12:48.457
So you pray to the gods to protect us.

12:51.461 --> 12:53.796
We have many gods.

12:55.757 --> 12:57.883
They've only got the one.

13:13.275 --> 13:15.359
Can't let him go.

13:16.653 --> 13:18.737
We need him.

13:20.824 --> 13:22.908
You need money, chieftain.

13:24.452 --> 13:26.537
Like everyone else.

13:28.498 --> 13:31.333
It's the only way to reason
with the Christians.

13:33.795 --> 13:35.838
You might as well get it from me.

14:38.693 --> 14:40.819
Who are you?

14:53.083 --> 14:55.084
Hood him.

14:56.252 --> 14:58.337
Take him away.

16:01.317 --> 16:03.819
[wind howling]

17:26.027 --> 17:28.069
What do you see?

17:32.992 --> 17:34.827
Yourself?

17:39.999 --> 17:42.042
When I die...

17:44.671 --> 17:46.797
...you will go back to hell.

18:02.438 --> 18:04.064
[yells]

18:46.733 --> 18:48.817
[chieftain] He's driven by hate.

18:51.237 --> 18:53.322
It's how he survives.

18:55.783 --> 18:57.826
Why he never loses.

19:01.748 --> 19:03.999
He'll come because he has to come.

19:06.002 --> 19:08.128
To finish it.

21:22.263 --> 21:24.347
Do you like it?

21:27.101 --> 21:30.103
My father gave it to me, I think.

23:04.073 --> 23:06.199
Are you from the clans, warrior?

23:12.206 --> 23:13.248
[boy] No.

23:15.585 --> 23:17.752
Why does the boy speak for you?

23:27.430 --> 23:30.015
Are you Christians?

23:33.519 --> 23:35.604
Yes.

23:40.151 --> 23:41.276
You're lying.

23:41.485 --> 23:45.947
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
I've heard about him.

23:47.116 --> 23:49.743
He's one of the biggest savages
in Sutherland.

23:51.913 --> 23:56.499
Killed our chieftain's son,
and most of his men, as well.

24:03.090 --> 24:04.633
Son.

25:12.326 --> 25:14.452
Does the mute have a name?

25:16.289 --> 25:19.833
His name is One-Eye.

25:20.042 --> 25:21.668
One-Eye.

25:24.422 --> 25:27.424
You can eat with us. Then we can talk.

25:28.718 --> 25:30.844
Or at least, the boy can.

25:36.726 --> 25:38.810
You need a name.

25:41.564 --> 25:43.690
And you've only got one eye.

25:47.737 --> 25:52.115
So... now you've got your freedom,

25:52.325 --> 25:54.326
what do you plan to do with it?

25:58.456 --> 26:00.540
I wanna go home.

26:02.626 --> 26:04.711
Where is that?

26:12.011 --> 26:14.220
Don't know.

26:16.307 --> 26:18.933
Maybe he could bring us luck.

26:23.606 --> 26:28.985
One-Eye...
I could use a good fighter like you.

26:31.739 --> 26:34.032
We're God's own soldiers, warrior.

26:35.076 --> 26:40.830
Heading for Jerusalem...
to reconquer the Holy Land.

26:44.001 --> 26:46.503
There's great honour in it.

26:46.670 --> 26:50.507
Riches. Land.

26:50.674 --> 26:52.550
Isn't that right, soldier?

26:52.760 --> 26:54.803
Yeah.

26:56.013 --> 26:58.139
That's right.

27:03.646 --> 27:05.772
[man] Endless warfare.

27:08.067 --> 27:10.819
It makes more tramps than heroes.

27:16.283 --> 27:18.910
But you should come with us
to Jerusalem.

27:22.039 --> 27:25.542
Your sins will be absolved,
whether you live or die.

27:28.254 --> 27:30.630
You will see your loved ones again.

27:35.928 --> 27:38.012
Boy.

27:39.849 --> 27:42.642
Where does he come from?

27:45.020 --> 27:47.480
He was brought up from hell.

27:57.825 --> 27:59.868
So where is it, this hell?

28:02.663 --> 28:04.747
On the other side of the ocean.

28:08.043 --> 28:10.795
We're more than flesh and blood.

28:12.965 --> 28:15.049
More than revenge.

28:17.470 --> 28:19.512
All of these things go.

28:24.059 --> 28:26.352
You should consider your soul.

28:27.897 --> 28:30.064
That's where the real pain lies.

28:48.250 --> 28:50.293
Do you think he'll come back?

28:57.718 --> 28:59.802
If it's God's will.

30:31.020 --> 30:34.022
My father told so many tales
of the Holy Land.

30:37.943 --> 30:40.278
And I never tired of listening to him.

30:44.074 --> 30:46.492
All about its beauty.

30:47.661 --> 30:49.746
Its wealth.

30:57.713 --> 31:00.506
[man] Do you know what I do
when I'm scared?

31:03.552 --> 31:05.678
I pray to Christ.

31:07.681 --> 31:09.724
Do you know who he is?

31:12.561 --> 31:14.896
He sacrificed his life...

31:16.440 --> 31:19.067
...so that we could be free

31:19.193 --> 31:22.445
from pain and misery.

31:27.701 --> 31:30.078
You see, that's what we're doing.

31:31.288 --> 31:35.708
We're going to protect his land,
his kingdom.

31:37.753 --> 31:39.879
So you have to be strong.

32:04.822 --> 32:07.240
[man] Never seen a mist
like this before.

32:09.660 --> 32:11.744
So far from a shore.

32:15.290 --> 32:17.083
It's been how long?

32:18.001 --> 32:20.169
Days?

32:20.337 --> 32:22.922
Perhaps it's a curse.

32:23.924 --> 32:26.008
It's not a curse.

32:26.135 --> 32:29.178
It's just a mist, nothing more.

32:46.488 --> 32:49.365
This ship is yours, Lord.

32:49.533 --> 32:52.577
These men are yours, Lord.

32:52.745 --> 32:57.331
These swords we bear are for you, Lord.

32:57.499 --> 33:01.419
We ask you to send the wind
to lift this mist.

33:01.545 --> 33:04.881
We ask you, Lord, to send the wind

33:05.048 --> 33:10.428
to guide us on the path to your land,
to the Holy Land.

33:10.554 --> 33:15.016
We ask you, Lord,
to put your hand with our hands,

33:15.184 --> 33:17.643
to guide us to your kingdom.

34:00.813 --> 34:02.855
Don't do it again. You'll die.

34:06.151 --> 34:08.235
[man laughs]

34:10.030 --> 34:11.864
You're dead.

34:12.032 --> 34:14.074
[laughs]

34:15.869 --> 34:18.996
[man] You see, that's what we are doing.

34:19.164 --> 34:24.585
We are going to protect his land,
his kingdom.

34:39.851 --> 34:41.893
So you have to be strong.

36:02.851 --> 36:04.518
No winds.

36:08.523 --> 36:10.149
No current.

36:14.529 --> 36:16.155
It's a curse.

36:19.242 --> 36:22.370
Do you think the boy
could be the cause of this?

36:23.121 --> 36:25.206
Of course.

36:29.211 --> 36:31.253
How are we gonna kill him?

36:37.010 --> 36:39.053
I'll do it.

37:23.056 --> 37:25.099
- It was the boy.
- Shut up!

37:26.435 --> 37:28.978
- He killed one of our men.
- Back off.

37:29.104 --> 37:31.897
- Do something.
- I warned you what would happen.

37:32.065 --> 37:34.859
Now, back off.

38:49.309 --> 38:51.352
The boy said he was from hell.

38:54.564 --> 38:56.982
Maybe that's where we're going.

39:25.345 --> 39:27.429
[thudding]

40:46.051 --> 40:48.093
[chuckles]

41:18.041 --> 41:19.833
You want me to die?

41:53.034 --> 41:55.035
It's fresh water.

44:37.657 --> 44:39.700
It's a river.

45:31.794 --> 45:33.921
[birds chirping]

46:41.656 --> 46:43.740
[fluttering wings]

47:07.473 --> 47:09.641
[distant squawking]

48:53.746 --> 48:55.831
[buzzing flies]

50:13.367 --> 50:16.578
I'm gonna show them
a man of God has arrived.

51:02.667 --> 51:04.709
[rustling]

51:41.372 --> 51:45.166
So... if we're not in the Holy Land...

51:49.505 --> 51:51.590
...then where the hell are we?

52:11.319 --> 52:13.445
Where did you get that?

52:46.812 --> 52:48.897
Where is he?

52:52.693 --> 53:07.874
Hello!

53:16.133 --> 53:18.218
[man] He killed him.

53:22.515 --> 53:24.641
One-Eye's gonna kill us all.

53:29.897 --> 53:32.023
One by one.

53:47.832 --> 53:49.874
I had a dream about this once.

53:54.213 --> 53:56.256
I couldn't find my way home...

54:00.219 --> 54:02.679
...and then I realised I was dead.

54:09.520 --> 54:12.105
[man] What are we going to do
about our friend?

54:14.233 --> 54:16.818
[man 2] Leave a sword.

54:16.986 --> 54:20.655
If he finds it, it's God's will.

54:24.535 --> 54:27.871
We have to keep moving,
find out where we are.

54:58.277 --> 55:00.528
[screams]

55:08.037 --> 55:11.331
It's the fucking mud!
Get us out of the fucking mud!

55:11.499 --> 55:14.250
- Leave him!
- Help me!

55:14.418 --> 55:16.503
- Fuck off!
- [screams]

55:16.670 --> 55:22.258
- Let's get ashore and fight!
- Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

55:22.426 --> 55:23.885
Move!

57:03.694 --> 57:05.778
Look at this.

57:10.117 --> 57:12.243
Stone.

57:14.205 --> 57:16.247
That's iron.

57:20.044 --> 57:21.878
They're primitives.

57:23.881 --> 57:26.925
God brought us out of that mist
for a reason.

57:27.885 --> 57:31.054
We claim this land in his name.

57:32.264 --> 57:34.891
How do we do that?

57:37.436 --> 57:40.104
We're half starved.

57:40.940 --> 57:43.816
Three men dead.

57:43.984 --> 57:46.069
One missing.

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:17.204
[man] Can you hear me?

01:06:29.634 --> 01:06:31.719
We left your sword.

01:06:36.141 --> 01:06:38.225
Can you not hear him?

01:06:41.104 --> 01:06:43.189
He talks.

01:06:45.525 --> 01:06:46.859
[man] Who?

01:06:50.155 --> 01:06:51.989
One-Eye.

01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:57.745
What's he saying?

01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:01.207
He says we're in hell.

01:07:12.803 --> 01:07:17.014
I told you, he brought us here.

01:07:22.562 --> 01:07:24.647
We have to leave this place.

01:07:27.567 --> 01:07:29.860
We have to go into the forest.

01:07:31.404 --> 01:07:34.031
Is he speaking through you now?

01:07:35.033 --> 01:07:37.785
It's the only way out.

01:07:37.911 --> 01:07:40.788
What do you mean, out?

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:43.541
Home.

01:07:44.251 --> 01:07:46.460
- We have to go back.
- Back to that mist?

01:07:46.628 --> 01:07:49.880
- Have you lost your mind?
- We have to find salt water.

01:07:50.048 --> 01:07:53.425
- That's the road out of here.
- No.

01:07:53.593 --> 01:07:56.053
We stay and show them
what men are capable of

01:07:56.263 --> 01:07:58.180
when they act in the name of God.

01:07:58.306 --> 01:08:01.767
We've raised the cross.
Now we bring the sword.

01:08:01.935 --> 01:08:05.604
The heathen will be converted,
their sins cleansed,

01:08:05.772 --> 01:08:08.315
a new Jerusalem established!

01:08:09.901 --> 01:08:15.030
You promised us riches.
And the Holy Lands.

01:08:16.408 --> 01:08:18.868
Well, One-Eye took us to hell.

01:08:19.035 --> 01:08:21.787
And there is no God.

01:08:37.053 --> 01:08:50.983
[yells]

01:08:58.575 --> 01:09:00.658
No.

01:10:10.105 --> 01:10:12.189
We need to follow him.

01:10:32.419 --> 01:10:34.878
My lifelong friend.

01:10:35.046 --> 01:10:37.589
Will you turn your back on me?

01:10:49.602 --> 01:10:51.729
Go on, then.

01:10:54.899 --> 01:10:57.026
Turn your back on God.

01:10:58.236 --> 01:11:03.866
Only men of faith deserve the riches
of my new Jerusalem!

01:11:35.565 --> 01:11:37.941
I will build crosses
up and down the river

01:11:38.109 --> 01:11:41.111
to guide our brothers
when they come to join us.

01:11:44.282 --> 01:11:46.325
They'll bring women.

01:11:49.871 --> 01:11:53.165
Our cities will stand
for a thousand years.

01:11:54.501 --> 01:11:56.627
And you...

01:11:57.837 --> 01:12:01.298
...spiritual advisor
in my new Jerusalem.

01:12:09.265 --> 01:12:16.522
[laughs]

01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:18.430
Could I ever forgive my father
for bringing me to this place?

01:16:24.103 --> 01:16:28.398
I came here to beg forgiveness
from my sons.

01:16:36.532 --> 01:16:39.368
I wasn't there when they died in battle.

01:16:46.751 --> 01:16:48.877
It matters, doesn't it...

01:16:52.298 --> 01:16:54.299
...how I leave?

01:16:58.763 --> 01:17:00.806
Yes.

01:17:12.777 --> 01:17:14.820
Tell me...

01:17:20.243 --> 01:17:22.285
He says I'm gonna reach the sea.

01:17:27.333 --> 01:17:29.459
Gonna build a new boat.

01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:35.924
Gonna go home.

01:17:40.304 --> 01:17:42.431
What does he say about me?

01:17:54.068 --> 01:17:56.194
You're gonna die.

01:17:58.865 --> 01:18:00.949
Then he's lying.

01:18:04.287 --> 01:18:09.499
If he's lying...
why are you following him?

01:18:23.848 --> 01:18:25.891
Why did I come here, One-Eye?

01:18:30.605 --> 01:18:32.689
Why did I have to go through this?

01:18:36.068 --> 01:18:38.153
Tell me.

01:19:03.888 --> 01:19:05.972
I have to go back.

01:19:09.644 --> 01:19:11.728
I have to be with my father.

01:19:19.111 --> 01:19:21.238
Even if he's dead.

01:19:23.866 --> 01:19:25.951
Your sons are dead...
