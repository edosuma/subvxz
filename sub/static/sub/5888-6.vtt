NARRATOR:
Two weeks ago, an invisible dome

00:04.588 --> 00:06.374
crashed down on Chester's Mill,

00:06.548 --> 00:08.459
cutting us off
from the rest of the world.

00:08.634 --> 00:10.966
Why the dome is here,
or What mysteries lie ahead,

00:11.136 --> 00:14.549
we still don 't know.
Every day, it tests our limits,

00:14.723 --> 00:17.305
bringing out the best
and the worst in us.

00:18.977 --> 00:21.810
Some say we '/I be stuck here
forever.

00:21.980 --> 00:25.723
But we will never stop ﬁghting
to ﬁnd a way out.

00:26.235 --> 00:29.068
- Why are you looking for Sam?
- He's known who Melanie is all along.

00:29.238 --> 00:31.900
Wondering when you'd show up.
Aren't you afraid of people seeing us?

00:32.074 --> 00:33.939
You made a promise 25 years ago

00:34.117 --> 00:37.029
to make sure that what we buried
stayed buried.

00:37.204 --> 00:39.411
You've come to set me free.

00:39.581 --> 00:41.321
My mother said you had answers.
I want them.

00:41.959 --> 00:43.665
- Aah!
LYLE: I'm out for good now.

00:43.835 --> 00:45.120
JULIA:
Those are the fingertips of a hand.

00:45.295 --> 00:48.082
Looks like Angie got a piece
of whoever did this to her.

00:50.259 --> 00:52.625
You think this is where
Lyle disappeared to?

00:52.803 --> 00:54.213
It's a tunnel.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.424
- You tried to kill us all.
- Julia, I didn't do it.

00:56.598 --> 00:59.465
What Big Jim and Rebecca
tried to do is inexcusable.

00:59.643 --> 01:01.383
But it's not unforgivable.

01:01.562 --> 01:04.269
I think she's done a hell of a job
running Chester's Mill.

[JUNIOR EXHALES]

01:36.888 --> 01:39.174
REBECCA: What do you see?
- Basement.

01:39.349 --> 01:41.726
I didn't know it was even
under this part of the school.

01:41.893 --> 01:43.303
SAM:
Any sign of Lyle?

01:44.896 --> 01:46.102
JUNIOR:
There's footprints.

01:46.273 --> 01:47.979
They're heading up into this tunnel.

01:48.150 --> 01:49.310
Be careful.

01:49.484 --> 01:52.191
- Barbie is sheriff now. Maybe--
- Lyle killed Angie.

01:52.362 --> 01:54.569
I tracked him down here.
I'm doing this.

01:54.740 --> 01:56.856
Not alone.

02:13.842 --> 02:15.048
REBECCA:
Please come back.

02:15.218 --> 02:16.799
Lyle's dangerous.

02:17.304 --> 02:18.544
Not for long.

02:19.389 --> 02:21.971
Hey. I need to borrow your Prius.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.841
You going looking for Lyle?

02:24.019 --> 02:27.136
Yeah. Well, as long as he's out there
on the loose, he's my problem.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.600
I'm not gonna sleep tonight
unless I do a few more sweeps.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.807
Being sheriff already
looks good on you.

02:32.444 --> 02:34.981
Also, if you talk to Sam,
get ahold of me on the walkie,

02:35.155 --> 02:36.520
because I want to question him too.

02:36.698 --> 02:37.778
JULIA:
About Melanie?

02:37.949 --> 02:41.112
Melanie, Angie,
what he's been doing all day.

02:41.286 --> 02:44.403
I'm not pointing any fingers,
just trying to explore other options.

02:44.581 --> 02:45.616
Be careful.

02:55.676 --> 02:58.383
I thought you were
with Joe and Norrie.

02:58.929 --> 03:00.840
They went home.

03:01.640 --> 03:04.256
They're mad at me.
I did something stupid.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.349
You want to tell me what?

03:08.188 --> 03:10.179
I kissed Joe.

03:12.317 --> 03:15.480
I know. Ijust wanted
to feel normal for a minute.

03:16.405 --> 03:20.398
- Melanie, you are normal.
- I died.

03:20.659 --> 03:23.150
Nothing about me is normal.

03:23.328 --> 03:27.071
Why am I even here?
Because I'm connected to some egg?

03:28.500 --> 03:30.661
That no one even knows where it is.

03:33.505 --> 03:34.836
Actually, I do.

03:36.508 --> 03:39.250
I dropped it in the lake
a few minutes before I found you.

03:40.470 --> 03:41.550
Why'd you do that?

03:41.722 --> 03:43.804
Because the dome wanted me to.

03:45.183 --> 03:48.767
It chose me. And I think
it brought you back for a reason.

03:49.438 --> 03:50.598
What reason?

03:52.149 --> 03:53.764
I don't know.

03:54.943 --> 03:58.401
- It was only one kiss. I'm sorry.
- But it's notjust that you kissed her.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.858
Ever since Melanie got here,
everything's been about her.

04:01.032 --> 04:04.024
- It's like there's no us anymore.
- But there is.

04:04.202 --> 04:05.612
I love you, Norrie.

04:06.037 --> 04:07.288
Too bad.

04:07.456 --> 04:09.367
I don't love you.

04:13.420 --> 04:16.537
- What are you doing?
- Why should I stay here then?

04:17.048 --> 04:19.460
Big Jim's not my family.
Or Carolyn.

04:20.135 --> 04:23.878
If you don't love me, then why would
you want me around here, right?

04:25.098 --> 04:26.133
Right.

It's a good feeling, isn't it?

Doing right by the town.
I love that feeling.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.603
You've had it so rarely.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.061
Yeah, well, you'll disappoint them
soon enough.

04:37.235 --> 04:39.066
You trying to rattle me, Jim?

04:39.237 --> 04:41.102
Don't want you to feel
too good about yourself.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.397
You and I both know
whose town this is.

04:43.575 --> 04:46.032
It's not yours. It's not mine.

04:46.203 --> 04:48.364
And the first thing I'm gonna do
is give it back to them.

04:50.916 --> 04:53.453
- Give it back to them?
- Voting.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.913
These people are entitled to a say
in what happens to them.

04:56.087 --> 04:57.998
Interesting.
You're gonna put a town on the brink

04:58.173 --> 04:59.788
in the hands of scared,
desperate people?

04:59.966 --> 05:02.082
Is there a brain under that hair?

05:02.636 --> 05:05.628
These people don't need
to talk about their feelings.

05:05.806 --> 05:06.966
They need to be led.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.471
I did you and Rebecca a favor

05:08.642 --> 05:11.008
by convincing these people
not to string you two up.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.471
Don't test my patience.

05:12.646 --> 05:16.855
The only reason this town didn't riot
is because I took your hand.

05:17.943 --> 05:19.854
Half this town is mine.
Don't you forget that.

05:22.531 --> 05:24.863
Hey. You know
what your girlfriend's doing?

town decision to a vote.

while Rome burns.

Yeah, well, tell her it's a bad idea.
She won't listen to me.

That's a wise woman.

on the same side when it counts.

on this whole extermination plan?

the benefit of the doubt,

05:50.433 --> 05:52.719

I think Lyle did this.

The town barber makes bombs?

He's always been a crafty guy,
and he's gone crazier

09:02.667 --> 09:05.204
than a rat in a jar
since the dome came down.

09:06.046 --> 09:09.538
He's smart enough
to bait the trap with a journal.

Well, we're not getting out
the way we came.

09:19.851 --> 09:21.807

He's done more for me than you did.
What are you even doing here?

I don't need your permission
to go here or anywhere else.

I'm trying to bandage your son.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.622
I heard you radio Barbie.
Where is he?

09:47.796 --> 09:49.912
Sam and I were tracking down Lyle.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.876
Barbie came after us
and then all of a sudden,

09:52.050 --> 09:54.587
I tripped on something
and there was a cave-in.

09:54.761 --> 09:57.798
You went through this locker?

10:00.391 --> 10:04.259
- Where are they? Are they all right?
- There's rocks blocking them in.

10:04.562 --> 10:05.642
We have to get them out.

10:05.814 --> 10:08.556
In case you haven't noticed, we got
bigger problems than those two.

10:13.863 --> 10:16.730
The acidity in the red rain
must have fried the topsoil.

10:16.908 --> 10:19.024
Yeah, well,
it's blowing around everywhere

10:19.202 --> 10:22.069
and coating everything,
including the inside of the dome.

10:22.247 --> 10:23.737
Which is semipermeable.

10:23.915 --> 10:27.453
If the dome walls get clogged,
no air is gonna be able to get in.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.369
And then we suffocate. All of us.

10:30.547 --> 10:31.627
How long until that happens?

A giant windmill maybe.

10:42.517 --> 10:45.759
I had the kids working on some,
but I had to put it on the back burner.

10:45.937 --> 10:47.677
We still have
all the materials though.

Lyle might have already gotten out.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.665
There's no way of knowing
if he's down there.

Better he's here than hunting
Barbie and Sam down there.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.959
Yeah, but if he's back up here,
he's just as dangerous.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.624
Sam and I found out
that Lyle wasn't just after Angie.

11:17.802 --> 11:19.258
He's after the four hands.

11:19.429 --> 11:20.714
How does he know
about the hands?

11:20.889 --> 11:23.676
My mom drew a picture of us
holding up the dome way back when.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.182
Now, Lyle thinks that if we're dead,

11:26.352 --> 11:28.263
the rapture comes.

11:28.688 --> 11:32.146
- So he wanted to kill you too?
- Yeah. He knew I'd follow him.

11:32.317 --> 11:34.273
I'm pretty sure that bomb there
was meant for me.

11:34.444 --> 11:36.230
We need to make sure
Joe and Norrie are safe.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.485
- I'll do that.
- Be careful.

11:38.656 --> 11:40.317
- I'll go with him.
- Melanie, I don't--

11:40.491 --> 11:42.652
They're my friends too. I'm going.

I'll make sure she's safe. I promise.

all your life, right?

11:49.667 --> 11:51.828

Yeah, we were friends growing up.

11:52.003 --> 11:53.709
BARBIE:
You hear or seen anything recently

11:53.880 --> 11:56.246
that makes you think
he may have killed Angie?

11:57.175 --> 11:58.540
I haven't seen him in years.

11:59.469 --> 12:00.925
But between kidnapping Rebecca,

12:01.095 --> 12:03.962
clocking Junior and all that,
makes sense.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.598
So then why did you guys stop
being friends?

12:07.769 --> 12:09.430
Something happen?

12:09.604 --> 12:13.188
Nope. I suppose people
just grow apart.

You go left, I go right,

27:51.962 --> 27:53.873
What are you doing
teaching high school?

27:54.047 --> 27:56.834
- You mean, how'd I screw up my life?
- That's not what I meant.

27:57.634 --> 28:00.011
I was headed to Cornell
before I came to Chester's Mill.

28:00.179 --> 28:01.419
Why the change?

28:02.347 --> 28:04.599
My dad got sick.

28:04.766 --> 28:07.758
I had to take care of him
before he died.

28:09.938 --> 28:12.315
Can't be all that different
from your story.

28:12.482 --> 28:14.859
You are a journalist, right?

28:15.319 --> 28:17.025
Was Chester's Mill your dream job?

28:17.196 --> 28:18.311
No, it wasn't.

28:18.488 --> 28:21.025
See?
Neither of us wanted to be here.

28:21.283 --> 28:22.819
But we are. It's not fate.

28:22.993 --> 28:25.700
We made choices,
and we ended up here.

28:27.998 --> 28:29.488
Maybe I could have helped
more people

28:29.666 --> 28:32.954
ifl hadn't helped my dad,
but that wasn't gonna happen.

28:34.630 --> 28:36.916
So you and me are stuck doing this.

28:38.508 --> 28:40.499
Why'd you work with Jim?

28:42.471 --> 28:45.554
Because I thought his heart
was in the right place.

28:46.099 --> 28:48.351
I was wrong about that.

28:49.853 --> 28:54.062
I don't think I'm wrong about you.
Careful.

29:00.489 --> 29:02.195
JOE:
The dust cleared up.

29:02.366 --> 29:03.526
Yeah.

29:03.700 --> 29:05.361
So, what now?

29:05.535 --> 29:07.947
- It's been hours.
- The egg knows we're here.

29:08.121 --> 29:10.203
I can feel it.

29:10.499 --> 29:11.705
It's like it's waiting.

29:11.875 --> 29:13.786
All I know,
this egg isn't showing itself.

29:13.961 --> 29:15.201
Even with all of us here.

29:16.421 --> 29:18.252
Maybe we have
to do something together.

29:18.423 --> 29:19.924
Like what?

29:21.051 --> 29:22.837
Like when Angie was here,

29:23.011 --> 29:24.512
and we all touched the mini dome.

29:24.680 --> 29:26.341
Melanie was one of the original
four hands.

29:26.515 --> 29:27.595
Maybe she still counts.

29:31.353 --> 29:32.388
But Norrie's right.

29:34.564 --> 29:37.180
I don't hear any other ideas.

29:56.503 --> 29:57.743
It's working.

30:08.598 --> 30:10.930
So why is Melanie back now?

30:11.977 --> 30:13.717
To haunt me?

30:14.021 --> 30:15.227
To bring everyone more pain?

30:16.565 --> 30:18.897
- It's not all pain under this thing.
- The hell it's not.

30:19.234 --> 30:21.691
Every day is a new nightmare.

30:21.862 --> 30:23.898
Dome's a slow execution
for everyone in here.

30:24.072 --> 30:25.653
You of all people should know that.

30:25.824 --> 30:28.190
Yeah, but I deal with it.

30:29.870 --> 30:32.486
You look for what makes...

30:32.664 --> 30:34.700
What makes going on worth it.

30:35.125 --> 30:36.956
Take Julia.

30:37.127 --> 30:39.288
Being with her, that's...

30:39.463 --> 30:42.079
It's a chance for me to be good.

30:44.509 --> 30:47.171
The dome scares me too,

30:48.889 --> 30:50.550
but it's not all pain.

30:51.183 --> 30:54.471
Sometimes I see Melanie's face
in the dark

30:54.644 --> 30:57.727
with the blood starting to pour out.

30:58.982 --> 31:02.099
Ifl could change one thing in my life,
that'd be it.

31:02.277 --> 31:04.017
Yeah, I know how you feel.

31:04.196 --> 31:05.777
Oh, yeah?

31:06.365 --> 31:07.400
Who'd you kill?

31:09.034 --> 31:11.320
A lot of people.

31:15.165 --> 31:17.577
Given the way things are going,

31:19.336 --> 31:21.793
I know it's gonna happen again.

31:23.673 --> 31:26.210
I don't want that...

31:31.973 --> 31:34.180
...but sometimes you see their faces...

31:40.023 --> 31:41.058
...and you wonder--

31:41.233 --> 31:43.645
Are they gonna be waiting for you
on the other side?

31:44.903 --> 31:46.484
- Yep.
- Yeah.

31:46.655 --> 31:50.694
The other day I found her
waiting for me on this side.

31:51.535 --> 31:53.696
What the hell can I say to her?

31:57.374 --> 31:59.410
BARBIE:
Well, unh,

32:00.502 --> 32:02.208
when we get out of here,

32:03.213 --> 32:05.078
maybe you can give it a try.

32:05.507 --> 32:08.920
I know Melanie just wants answers
more than anything.

32:09.094 --> 32:11.255
As far as what happened
between you two

32:11.430 --> 32:15.514
25 years ago,
that's between you and her.

32:16.393 --> 32:17.599
Thank you.

32:18.019 --> 32:19.680
Thanks for not letting me fall.

32:29.656 --> 32:33.399
- Hey, those aren't from rocks.
- Hey!

32:36.955 --> 32:38.991
Where'd you get
those scratches, Sam?

32:46.590 --> 32:51.129
Put that there,
and this one will fit right here.

32:51.303 --> 32:52.543
And I connect the fuse.

32:53.513 --> 32:55.754
Thank God for the Department
of Roads and Repair.

32:56.224 --> 32:59.341
- You praying?
- No, but I hope to God this works.

33:10.947 --> 33:13.063
Okay. Let's do this.

33:13.241 --> 33:15.448
Back to the entrance, right?

33:15.619 --> 33:17.280
Okay.

33:21.166 --> 33:23.623
BARBIE: Those are defensive wounds
from fingernails.

33:23.793 --> 33:26.956
- You're kidding, right?
- Angie was a fighter.

33:27.214 --> 33:29.045
She got a piece
of whoever tried to kill her.

33:29.216 --> 33:30.922
The skin under her fingernails
showed that.

33:31.092 --> 33:32.707
- Barbie--
- You killed her, Sam.

33:32.886 --> 33:34.251
Not Lyle, you.

33:34.429 --> 33:37.512
And everything you've done has been
to put the blame back onto him.

33:37.682 --> 33:41.971
The guy's a maniac.
You saw what he did to Rebecca.

33:42.145 --> 33:43.385
And he attacked my nephew.

33:43.563 --> 33:45.770
You killed a 19-year-old girl
that your nephew loved.

33:45.941 --> 33:48.023
I had to!

33:48.818 --> 33:52.606
Everything Pauline put in herjournal
has come true.

33:53.657 --> 33:55.648
It says in here
that if those four kids die,

33:55.825 --> 33:57.201
the dome comes down.

33:57.369 --> 34:00.406
It's a sacrifice I have to make
to save everyone.

34:01.873 --> 34:05.832
- You would even kill Junior?
- At some point I'll have to.

34:06.503 --> 34:09.836
I'll finish it, and I'll finally be free.

34:12.175 --> 34:15.133
Then I will kill myself.

34:16.012 --> 34:17.968
Or you can kill me.

34:18.139 --> 34:20.175
Hell, I'll thank you for it.

34:20.642 --> 34:24.430
You will never see my face in the dark,
I swear.

You're not even gonna touch

I'm taking you in.

34:31.861 --> 34:33.442

34:33.613 --> 34:36.650
is gonna be whatever Junior does
to you once he finds out.

34:49.629 --> 34:50.835
She's not so bad.

34:51.506 --> 34:52.541
Now you believe her?

34:53.717 --> 34:55.582
Yes.

34:57.387 --> 34:58.547
I'm sorry.

34:59.055 --> 35:00.261
For what?

35:01.349 --> 35:03.340
For not giving you a break

35:03.518 --> 35:05.804
like you gave me
after my mom died.

35:10.692 --> 35:13.183
I'm sorry I ever made you
feel like I didn't love you.

35:15.447 --> 35:17.108
I love you too.

Do you think Lyle
is following us?

35:25.874 --> 35:29.332
I don't know. I'm just being careful.

I saw that in my dream.

I've seen it too.

36:18.301 --> 36:19.837
Years ago.

It's in my home town,

36:37.153 --> 36:38.768
They're smart guys, right?

36:39.155 --> 36:41.988
They'll know to put some space
between them and the blockage?

They won't be hurt.

You ready?

I trust you.

If you've got any sense
of right or wrong left,

37:34.294 --> 37:36.831
you're gonna look Junior
in the face and tell him what you did.

37:37.380 --> 37:40.793
Take it. When the time comes,
you'll need it.

37:40.967 --> 37:44.835
- You owe Junior the truth.
- You'll see, it's all pain.

I think we all have something
to be proud of today, right?

38:33.102 --> 38:36.230
Real question is,
where has Julia been all day?

38:36.397 --> 38:37.432
Well, I heard that Barbie

38:37.607 --> 38:40.690
got into some kind of trouble
over at the high school.

38:40.860 --> 38:44.193
