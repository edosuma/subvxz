The world
will have to deal with us.

00:45.050 --> 00:46.916
<i>Previously on</i> The 4400...

00:47.016 --> 00:48.715
<i>Promicin is out there.</i>

00:49.099 --> 00:52.182
<i>People are gaining abilities,
and nothing can be done about that.</i>

00:52.299 --> 00:54.516
Kyle, listen to me.
If you're involved in something...

00:54.616 --> 00:57.432
Collier will lead the human race
to salvation. You will help him.

00:57.532 --> 00:59.849
- What is this place?
- Cassie said we should come here.

00:59.949 --> 01:01.449
You are on the wrong path here.

01:01.549 --> 01:03.057
And you've always
been rebellious,

01:03.157 --> 01:05.719
but I think
you're afraid of change, Shawn...

01:06.916 --> 01:07.916
or is it just me?

01:08.016 --> 01:10.149
<i>You don't really
know this girl at all, do you?</i>

01:10.249 --> 01:11.399
Baby...

01:11.749 --> 01:13.600
Get your hands off of me.

01:14.807 --> 01:18.049
I share an office with two of the most
annoying guys on the planet.

01:18.149 --> 01:20.566
I don't understand why Collier
would risk coming back to Seattle.

01:20.666 --> 01:22.244
It's like he's daring us
to catch him.

01:22.344 --> 01:23.949
This is a message of hope

01:24.049 --> 01:25.649
<i>for a better tomorrow,</i>

01:25.766 --> 01:28.865
<i>and it begins here,</i>
<i>in Promise City.</i>

01:28.965 --> 01:31.949
I was going to ask you if you wanted
to be a part of this operation.

01:32.049 --> 01:33.949
Believe me, I want Collier
as much as anyone.

01:34.049 --> 01:35.649
It's not Collier
I was thinking about.

01:35.749 --> 01:38.424
He's my son. I've got to believe
I can still reach him.

02:32.469 --> 02:34.802
Diana, what the hell's going on?
Where is everyone?

02:34.902 --> 02:36.449
I don't know.
You're the first person I've seen.

02:36.549 --> 02:38.549
I just woke up
on the floor of the break room.

02:38.649 --> 02:39.916
Why were you sleeping
in the break room?

02:39.999 --> 02:42.166
- I don't know.
- Why was I sleeping at my desk?

02:43.049 --> 02:44.666
The last thing I remember
was going...

02:45.149 --> 02:46.616
- to bed at home.
- The last thing I remember,

02:46.716 --> 02:48.766
I was going over case files
in my living room.

02:52.232 --> 02:54.366
Why did I just wake up
underneath my office chair?

02:55.432 --> 02:57.149
Please tell me
you know how we got here.

02:57.916 --> 02:59.682
<i>Possibility one,
we're under attack.</i>

02:59.866 --> 03:01.649
Someone with a grudge
against the NTAC,

03:01.749 --> 03:03.566
used a 4400 ability against us.

03:03.799 --> 03:06.349
- Maybe more than one.
- That would explain the memory gaps.

03:06.449 --> 03:08.616
But if a 4400
were coming after us,

03:08.749 --> 03:10.098
why are we still alive?

03:10.449 --> 03:12.315
Are we the only survivors
in the building?

03:12.765 --> 03:13.765
Maybe,

03:13.896 --> 03:16.546
or maybe the attackers haven't
gotten down to our level yet.

03:16.766 --> 03:18.299
Let's not ignore
possibility two...

03:18.399 --> 03:20.549
The world at large
is under attack.

03:20.649 --> 03:23.049
The building's reacting to
a security situation out there.

03:23.149 --> 03:25.500
So, what, we're the only
survivors in the world?

03:26.941 --> 03:30.349
Could we come up with a possibility
that doesn't involve an attack?

03:32.104 --> 03:33.149
It's not responding.

03:33.732 --> 03:35.232
We're locked out of
the building's network.

03:35.332 --> 03:36.732
I can't even
access the system.

03:38.282 --> 03:41.048
Maybe we can do it from OPS.
Try to get in through the mainframe,

03:41.148 --> 03:43.444
establish some kind of contact
with the outside world.

03:43.544 --> 03:45.644
Or maybe we could just
walk out the front door.

03:46.999 --> 03:48.416
Do you hear that alarm?

03:48.516 --> 03:51.149
That means the building's sealed,
and it's going to stay sealed

03:51.249 --> 03:53.432
until someone overrides
the security protocols.

03:54.016 --> 03:56.449
We could be the only ones here
who know how to do that.

03:57.474 --> 03:58.515
All right.

03:59.174 --> 04:00.174
Get yourself ready to go.

04:00.791 --> 04:02.549
I don't care
if this building is crawling

04:02.649 --> 04:05.107
with every p-positive in Seattle,
we're getting to OPS.

04:06.857 --> 04:08.124
First, wake up P.J.

04:15.321 --> 04:16.321
Wake up, man.

04:24.700 --> 04:27.608
No phones, no email.
Even the emergency radio doesn't work.

04:27.708 --> 04:29.340
Internal surveillance is down, too.

04:29.440 --> 04:31.007
I can't find a sidearm
anywhere.

04:32.199 --> 04:33.369
Good to see we're not alone.

04:33.486 --> 04:35.036
God, tell me
you've got some answers.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.557
You got into the network.
Good job, Brady.

04:38.832 --> 04:40.532
That wasn't me.
I'm still locked out.

04:40.649 --> 04:41.899
The alarm just went silent.

04:42.412 --> 04:45.174
The phones are still dead.
If the security system is down,

04:45.274 --> 04:47.349
that could mean the exits aren't sealed.
We could get out of here.

04:47.424 --> 04:49.940
It's worth checking out.
Tom, you and I will scout ahead,

04:50.040 --> 04:52.049
make sure there's
a safe path to the exit.

04:52.149 --> 04:54.507
Oh, and, Diana, make sure
you stick with these guys.

04:54.607 --> 04:57.257
Watch their backs while they work
on establishing communications.

05:02.700 --> 05:03.707
Wait.

05:03.866 --> 05:06.149
- Let's go. No one's there.
- There's no one anywhere.

05:06.249 --> 05:08.200
We haven't seen a soul
since we left OPS.

06:22.416 --> 06:24.499
Collier, what the hell
did you do to this place?

06:24.599 --> 06:25.607
Dad?

06:26.491 --> 06:28.507
Kyle?
What's going on here?

06:32.257 --> 06:33.341
- Answer me!
- Kyle, run!

06:34.474 --> 06:35.474
Hold it!

06:41.648 --> 06:42.949
Kyle, no!
Kyle, wait!

06:43.049 --> 06:44.749
Wait, kyle!
Open the door.

06:44.924 --> 06:46.249
Open the door, Kyle!

06:46.382 --> 06:48.482
Whatever you're doing here,
you have to stop.

06:48.732 --> 06:50.349
You have to convince Collier
to stop.

06:50.449 --> 06:51.457
Open the door!

07:06.266 --> 07:07.266
What are you doing here?

07:07.766 --> 07:09.316
Where are we?
What did you do to me?

07:13.355 --> 07:14.572
What the hell is going on?

07:14.677 --> 07:16.161
It wasn't me.
I didn't do anything.

07:18.900 --> 07:20.067
This looks like NTAC.

07:22.700 --> 07:23.900
Did we get arrested?

07:26.191 --> 07:28.191
I was working late
in my apartment.

07:29.657 --> 07:31.557
I don't remember anything
after that.

07:39.267 --> 07:41.600
Maybe the government's
rounding up 4400s.

07:41.791 --> 07:44.449
They have soldiers with abilities.
They could've messed with our memories.

07:44.549 --> 07:46.357
Why would they put
you and me together?

07:48.500 --> 07:49.500
Hello?

08:29.566 --> 08:31.348
I don't understand.
Collier has just built

08:31.448 --> 08:33.682
a huge settlement for himself
in the middle of Seattle.

08:33.782 --> 08:34.881
That's a huge win for him.

08:34.982 --> 08:36.881
Why would he risk everything
and attack the building?

08:36.982 --> 08:38.948
He didn't stick around
to explain himself.

08:39.332 --> 08:41.782
Whatever he's planning,
we have to be ready to defend ourselves.

08:41.881 --> 08:42.881
Guys...

08:43.049 --> 08:45.366
Can we lower the blast doors
over the entrances to this room?

08:45.532 --> 08:48.016
They're controlled by the computer,
and we still can't access the system.

08:48.149 --> 08:50.366
We could move the furniture
and build a barricade.

08:50.482 --> 08:52.749
Great, we'll make a wall
made out of desks and chairs.

08:52.849 --> 08:55.449
I'm sure that will be really helpful,
especially if they've got somebody

08:55.532 --> 08:56.940
who can melt our brains
from around the corner.

08:57.040 --> 08:59.316
- Do you have a better idea?
- Wait, there's a weapons locker

08:59.399 --> 09:02.149
a few floors down. That's where
we store all the assault rifles.

09:02.249 --> 09:04.049
Maybe Collier hasn't
gotten to it yet.

09:04.149 --> 09:06.482
Believe me, I don't want to
point a gun at Kyle, but...

09:06.582 --> 09:08.316
if Collier
is leading some kind of attack,

09:08.416 --> 09:11.191
we need something more than
office supplies to fight back with.

09:21.099 --> 09:24.149
- What's happening? Why am I here?
- We checked that room. It was empty.

09:24.249 --> 09:26.574
You're okay now.
You're with me. You're safe.

09:28.724 --> 09:31.199
My dad and his boss seemed
just as surprised as we were.

09:31.323 --> 09:33.349
It sounded like they thought
Jordan brought us here.

09:33.449 --> 09:34.453
Did he?

09:35.190 --> 09:36.532
Jordan had nothing
to do with this.

09:36.732 --> 09:38.766
He doesn't always
share his plans, Kyle.

09:38.898 --> 09:41.182
- Guess you haven't learned that yet.
- My relationship with him

09:41.282 --> 09:43.448
is different from the one you two had.
He doesn't hide things from me,

09:43.549 --> 09:45.569
and he sure wasn't planning
an assault on NTAC.

09:45.669 --> 09:46.749
You guys, wait.

09:46.849 --> 09:48.516
We can't fight,
not now.

09:49.232 --> 09:50.982
We've got to find Jordan.
He's trapped in here, too.

09:51.066 --> 09:52.549
I'm not going anywhere
without him.

09:52.649 --> 09:55.432
You guys do whatever you want.
I'm going to find my way out of here.

09:56.866 --> 09:58.049
What, Isabelle?
What?

09:58.149 --> 10:00.032
Listen,
whatever's going on here,

10:00.132 --> 10:02.849
we have a much better chance
of getting out if we stick together.

10:02.949 --> 10:04.149
Now, stay with us.

10:04.249 --> 10:06.700
We'll find Jordan,
and we'll leave as a group.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.671
It's not responding.

10:11.907 --> 10:14.049
These locks are supposed
to run on reserve power.

10:14.149 --> 10:16.749
What good is a weapons locker if you
can't get into it during an emergency?

10:16.849 --> 10:18.949
Maybe we can find a crowbar
or something. Try to force the door.

10:19.049 --> 10:20.049
Hold on.

10:20.282 --> 10:23.932
If we can pry that face-pad off,
I might be able to short-circuit it.

10:24.249 --> 10:25.249
Really?

10:25.616 --> 10:27.682
You're going to...
hotwire the door open?

10:28.216 --> 10:29.632
Don't look so surprised.

10:30.349 --> 10:32.149
I worked in a think tank
for years.

10:32.549 --> 10:35.357
You'd be amazed at the things
I picked up around the water cooler.

10:35.474 --> 10:36.474
Try this.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.774
- Where'd you get that?
- My desk drawer.

10:41.257 --> 10:44.200
You said we might have to defend
ourselves with office supplies, so...

10:57.247 --> 10:58.247
What?

10:58.882 --> 10:59.899
Nothing.

11:00.016 --> 11:01.199
Nothing, I'm just...

11:01.515 --> 11:02.849
wondering how you do it.

11:03.016 --> 11:05.416
We all wake up in the middle of NTAC
with no explanation,

11:05.532 --> 11:08.249
and now we're down in the basement,
trying to break into a weapons locker

11:08.332 --> 11:10.716
so we can fight off an attack
by God knows how many people

11:10.816 --> 11:13.649
with 4400 abilities.
It seems pretty hopeless, right?

11:15.004 --> 11:17.871
But you,
you just keep moving forward.

11:18.904 --> 11:21.749
If I stopped cold
every time a situation looked hopeless,

11:21.849 --> 11:23.849
I wouldn't have lasted
very long in this job.

11:24.282 --> 11:26.282
All I do is focus on
what's in front of me.

11:26.682 --> 11:29.149
In a few years, you'll look back,
and you'll realize that you survived

11:29.249 --> 11:30.849
by doing exactly the same thing.

11:30.982 --> 11:34.099
A few years? I'm flattered
you think I'll last that long.

11:34.749 --> 11:36.338
Here, come on,
give me a hand.

11:36.987 --> 11:40.226
Right now, I'll twist,
and you pull, all right?

11:42.474 --> 11:43.474
There.

11:43.724 --> 11:44.724
All right.

11:48.467 --> 11:49.467
There we go.

11:54.567 --> 11:55.567
Jordan...

11:58.503 --> 12:01.083
And none of you has any idea
how we got here?

12:03.500 --> 12:05.374
But everyone's all right?
Nobody's hurt?

12:06.691 --> 12:07.691
I'm fine.

12:07.832 --> 12:10.049
- What are you doing here?
- All the exits are sealed,

12:10.149 --> 12:11.649
so I looked for this place.

12:12.149 --> 12:14.349
NTAC imprisons 4400s here,

12:14.449 --> 12:17.149
and those who have taken the shot.
I was looking for allies.

12:17.249 --> 12:19.674
The entire wing's empty,
so I guess you're out of luck.

12:20.800 --> 12:21.807
No.

12:22.549 --> 12:25.149
I'm not out of luck. I found you three.
That should be enough.

12:25.299 --> 12:26.349
Enough for what?

12:26.449 --> 12:28.582
Their operations center's
on the second level.

12:28.999 --> 12:31.216
Communications gear,
security controls.

12:31.666 --> 12:34.266
We get there, we can contact
Promise City, send for help.

12:34.382 --> 12:36.449
That's where my dad's office is.
They're all going to be there.

12:36.549 --> 12:37.549
Likely,

12:38.099 --> 12:40.499
There's no other way.
We need control of that room.

12:40.599 --> 12:43.849
You're talking about overpowering
a bunch of government agents, Jordan.

12:43.949 --> 12:45.499
What are we gonna do,
take hostages?

12:45.616 --> 12:47.949
Shawn, they brought us here
against our will.

12:48.499 --> 12:49.832
They're the aggressors.

12:50.349 --> 12:53.482
I'll walk out of here peacefully
if I can, but I will walk out of here.

12:53.882 --> 12:55.366
And any of you
not wanting to spend

12:55.466 --> 12:58.033
the rest of your life in one of
these cells should join me.

13:13.941 --> 13:15.749
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

13:15.849 --> 13:17.416
Yeah, it's fine.
It's fine.

13:18.541 --> 13:19.857
Prepare to be impressed.

13:24.338 --> 13:25.688
Guess the shock was worth it.

13:26.305 --> 13:27.471
I'm impressed.

13:31.691 --> 13:32.857
There's nothing here.

13:33.857 --> 13:34.900
It's empty!

13:38.182 --> 13:39.740
What happened?
Are you all right?

13:39.840 --> 13:40.849
<i>I'm fine.</i>

13:40.949 --> 13:44.049
I don't know what happened.
I'll try and get the lock open again.

13:50.574 --> 13:51.749
Are you there?

13:55.400 --> 13:56.649
My God, Meghan.

13:58.661 --> 13:59.661
Look at me.

14:18.261 --> 14:20.161
I don't understand
what happened.

14:20.388 --> 14:23.549
It's like that door closed by itself.
We were only apart for a few seconds.

14:23.649 --> 14:25.149
It was an accident, Tom.

14:25.749 --> 14:26.749
Maybe.

14:27.082 --> 14:29.549
But we wouldn't be stuck in here
if it wasn't for Collier.

14:29.682 --> 14:31.032
Meghan's death is on him.

14:31.132 --> 14:34.182
We can add it to the list of thousands
he's responsible for.

14:34.432 --> 14:35.999
<i>This doesn't make any sense.</i>

14:37.266 --> 14:38.482
<i>She shouldn't be dead.</i>

14:38.949 --> 14:41.282
<i>We have to get
the computers back online.</i>

14:41.391 --> 14:42.800
<i>Let's just focus on that.</i>

14:51.241 --> 14:53.641
What exactly are we
supposed to be looking for?

14:55.349 --> 14:57.374
Anything we can use
to defend ourselves.

15:11.298 --> 15:14.398
Kyle, this is crazy. Are we supposed
to use these on someone?

15:15.098 --> 15:16.098
I hope not.

15:26.400 --> 15:27.615
This was all I could find.

15:27.715 --> 15:29.840
A broom handle?
What am I supposed to do with this?

15:29.940 --> 15:31.765
Use it, or don't,

15:32.049 --> 15:34.049
but I'm not inclined to give up
without a fight.

15:34.165 --> 15:36.049
See, why do you think
that we need to fight?

15:36.149 --> 15:38.141
Didn't you say that
when you ran into my uncle

15:38.274 --> 15:40.220
that he thought
that you were behind this?

15:41.224 --> 15:42.557
You think that they are.

15:43.124 --> 15:44.524
Does that not beg the question,

15:44.716 --> 15:45.924
what if it was neither of us?

15:46.024 --> 15:47.774
What if something else
is causing this?

15:47.874 --> 15:51.026
First, we control that room,
then we ask questions.

15:51.791 --> 15:53.424
No, let's ask them now.

15:54.149 --> 15:56.566
What you seem to be forgetting
is one of those NTAC agents

15:56.666 --> 15:59.057
that you are so intent
on battling is my uncle.

15:59.299 --> 16:00.399
Kyle's father.

16:00.566 --> 16:02.916
There's gotta be some way
that we communicate with him.

16:03.032 --> 16:04.899
I'll go.
You three can wait here for me.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.209
What?

16:08.466 --> 16:10.916
It's just the future gave you
the right ability.

16:11.249 --> 16:14.349
You're always looking for
the peaceful solution, for healing.

16:16.032 --> 16:17.032
I admire that,

16:17.349 --> 16:19.691
even if it means you can't be
part of the movement.

16:28.115 --> 16:29.148
What's going on?

16:35.700 --> 16:36.853
Come on, we need to go.

16:45.550 --> 16:46.567
Get down!

17:21.250 --> 17:24.017
You know, it doesn't have to be
so weird and quiet in here.

17:24.849 --> 17:26.445
You guys
can talk to each other.

17:26.596 --> 17:27.613
What?

17:28.213 --> 17:29.596
It's not weird and quiet.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.282
Your mom and I talk to each other
all the time.

17:33.449 --> 17:34.449
I guess,

17:35.199 --> 17:37.732
but you used to come over
almost every night.

17:38.416 --> 17:39.449
We'd play games.

17:39.566 --> 17:40.574
It was fun,

17:42.299 --> 17:43.899
and you don't come over anymore.

17:45.249 --> 17:47.949
It's like we're supposed to pretend
nothing ever happened.

17:50.116 --> 17:51.732
It's complicated,
sweetie, but...

17:51.866 --> 17:54.003
Marco and I, we are friends.

17:55.127 --> 17:57.532
Aren't friends supposed to
see each other sometimes?

17:58.817 --> 18:00.508
Everybody, get out here!
They're coming!

18:03.495 --> 18:04.557
You keep the door locked

18:04.677 --> 18:06.284
and stay down,
no matter what you hear.

18:06.396 --> 18:08.115
Everyone, stay back!
just stay back!

18:09.733 --> 18:11.640
Whatever you're here to do,
whatever you want,

18:11.760 --> 18:14.089
- it's not going to happen.
- Dad, we're not doing this.

18:15.982 --> 18:17.174
Please let me in.

18:17.691 --> 18:18.846
We don't want to fight.

18:25.119 --> 18:26.734
Meghan Doyle
is dead, Kyle.

18:26.885 --> 18:28.556
Do you understand?
She's dead.

18:29.524 --> 18:32.078
- How could you do this?
- I told you, it's not us, all right?

18:32.377 --> 18:34.443
We just woke up here.
We don't know what happened.

18:35.022 --> 18:36.449
- It's the truth.
- You're lying...

18:36.562 --> 18:37.581
Oh, God.

18:38.342 --> 18:39.393
You're hurt?

18:39.600 --> 18:40.792
What happened?

18:42.129 --> 18:43.453
A window blew out.

18:44.204 --> 18:45.416
I got cut.

18:46.642 --> 18:48.576
- And shawn...
- Shawn?

18:50.919 --> 18:51.985
Oh, no...

19:02.704 --> 19:03.746
This isn't right.

19:04.075 --> 19:05.821
This isn't how it's
supposed to happen.

19:06.907 --> 19:08.051
He's dead.

19:08.171 --> 19:09.296
Because of you!

19:09.456 --> 19:11.403
Two people lost their lives
because of you!

19:11.523 --> 19:12.763
I had nothing to do with this!

19:12.883 --> 19:14.765
- The hell you didn't!
- Stop!

19:16.737 --> 19:18.118
He's telling the truth!

19:19.545 --> 19:20.906
He didn't
bring you here.

19:23.193 --> 19:24.301
I did.

19:26.598 --> 19:27.922
I made this happen.

19:28.504 --> 19:29.706
I took the shot.

19:30.983 --> 19:33.067
We're all here
because of my ability.

19:40.068 --> 19:41.890
I took the shot
about two months ago.

19:43.899 --> 19:45.533
Once promicin got out there,

19:45.690 --> 19:48.648
I knew it was going to
change everything forever.

19:49.327 --> 19:52.623
Science, politics, religion.

19:53.844 --> 19:55.881
I just wanted
to be part of it.

19:56.413 --> 19:57.727
I had to be part of it.

19:58.639 --> 19:59.700
Then one night,

19:59.865 --> 20:02.001
my fiancee and my mother

20:02.808 --> 20:05.794
had this huge fight
about the guest list at our wedding.

20:07.222 --> 20:08.230
I went to bed

20:08.350 --> 20:10.297
wishing there was
something I could do

20:10.417 --> 20:12.320
to smooth things over
between them.

20:13.575 --> 20:14.777
When I woke up,

20:15.957 --> 20:17.506
I was someplace else.

20:18.117 --> 20:20.257
Me, my mom, Sara.

20:21.494 --> 20:23.111
We didn't know
how we got there, but...

20:23.235 --> 20:26.002
we were trapped
in this huge traffic jam

20:26.122 --> 20:27.594
on the Spokane street bridge.

20:27.876 --> 20:30.834
It was an hour away from when
we were supposed to get married.

20:31.057 --> 20:33.147
We had to work together
to get across town,

20:33.267 --> 20:35.648
and when I say "work",
I mean, work.

20:35.881 --> 20:39.051
There were earthquakes,
floods, a fire.

20:39.171 --> 20:40.280
It was crazy.

20:40.670 --> 20:42.698
But we survived together,

20:43.331 --> 20:45.866
and we got to the church
just in time.

20:47.591 --> 20:49.920
I kissed Sara
at the end of the ceremony,

20:50.408 --> 20:52.695
and then we all woke up at home.

20:53.334 --> 20:54.358
The game was over.

20:54.536 --> 20:55.559
The game?

20:57.979 --> 21:01.294
I figured out how it works
since then my ability.

21:01.919 --> 21:02.971
It's like a game.

21:03.091 --> 21:05.590
P.J., stop using the word "game".
There are two people dead.

21:06.466 --> 21:07.790
I'm not sure about that.

21:08.466 --> 21:09.599
No one's ever died before.

21:09.719 --> 21:12.128
I don't know what that means
for the real world.

21:12.430 --> 21:14.927
Why NTAC?
Why did you pick this place?

21:15.593 --> 21:17.143
I didn't pick it.
You did.

21:18.345 --> 21:19.349
We all did.

21:19.485 --> 21:22.339
But I have no control
over anything else.

21:23.090 --> 21:25.024
We determine where we go,

21:25.703 --> 21:27.609
all of our mind, together.

21:28.385 --> 21:30.423
It's a subconscious thing.

21:30.753 --> 21:32.612
NTAC means something
different to each of us,

21:32.734 --> 21:34.242
but it matters to everyone?

21:34.362 --> 21:36.020
That's how we got here?

21:36.140 --> 21:37.165
Exactly,

21:37.817 --> 21:40.086
and there's always an obstacle...

21:40.206 --> 21:43.758
Something all the players
have to work together to overcome.

21:44.695 --> 21:47.743
I know this sounds weird,
but in this case,

21:47.863 --> 21:50.801
I think the obstacle
is the building itself.

21:51.205 --> 21:53.139
You're saying NTAC
is trying to kill us?

21:54.270 --> 21:55.706
That makes sense.

21:56.517 --> 21:58.319
The building electrocuted Meghan.

21:58.839 --> 22:00.248
The building caused the wind burst

22:00.368 --> 22:02.756
that shattered that window
and killed Shawn Farrell.

22:02.876 --> 22:04.522
So, what are we supposed to do?

22:04.935 --> 22:07.160
Just sit here
and wait for it to pick us all off?

22:08.793 --> 22:11.957
We're supposed to work together.
That's the whole point.

22:13.413 --> 22:15.231
I sit in my office every day,

22:15.351 --> 22:17.930
and I read about how
things are getting worse,

22:18.050 --> 22:21.860
about how it's just a matter of time
before everything blows up.

22:22.782 --> 22:25.110
A war between
positives and negatives.

22:25.923 --> 22:29.403
That's why I brought
people from both sides here.

22:29.523 --> 22:30.778
I wanted to help.

22:30.898 --> 22:32.984
I wanted to bring
the two camps together.

22:33.104 --> 22:35.685
So we get to watch
each other die one by one?

22:36.063 --> 22:37.509
That's a hell of a valuable lesson.

22:37.631 --> 22:39.281
You haven't just
put our lives at stake.

22:39.868 --> 22:43.485
If I die, if Kyle dies here, that could
mean the end of the movement.

22:43.605 --> 22:45.698
You've jeopardized
everything we've worked for.

22:48.077 --> 22:50.209
Let's not make it easy
for this place to hurt us.

22:50.329 --> 22:53.018
We should move all the computers
outta here. Anything electronic...

22:53.140 --> 22:54.814
No, there might be a way out of this.

22:55.451 --> 22:56.836
The last couple times I played,

22:56.956 --> 22:59.987
I figured out that
there's always a back door.

23:00.365 --> 23:01.558
If I find it,

23:01.738 --> 23:04.066
I can walk through it,
and if I do,

23:04.621 --> 23:05.907
the game ends.

23:06.594 --> 23:07.852
We all wake up.

23:09.158 --> 23:10.767
Hopefully,
Shawn and Meghan do, too.

23:10.887 --> 23:11.913
Where is it?

23:13.188 --> 23:15.663
It's usually at the far
edge of the playing field.

23:15.783 --> 23:17.409
Wherever I woke up in the game,

23:17.529 --> 23:19.756
it's as far away from there
as possible.

23:20.165 --> 23:22.230
Wait, wait, you came to
in the theory room, right?

23:22.583 --> 23:24.143
Marco, find some maps
of the building.

23:24.263 --> 23:26.076
Figure out where this
back door should be.

23:26.343 --> 23:28.887
Everyone, get to work,
and be careful.

23:31.528 --> 23:33.302
Do you think Shawn's really gone?

23:36.031 --> 23:37.815
I don't know. Let's hope not.

23:41.473 --> 23:44.825
Look, I know you think
taking the shot was wrong.

23:46.481 --> 23:47.946
But I knew what I was doing.

23:52.555 --> 23:54.884
I mean, I knew that
following Collier meant

23:55.039 --> 23:56.973
I had to get used to people dying,

23:58.571 --> 23:59.989
maybe even people I knew.

24:02.962 --> 24:04.314
I kept saying, you know,

24:06.651 --> 24:08.904
these deaths weren't meaningless.

24:10.213 --> 24:11.659
They were sacrifices.

24:13.673 --> 24:14.809
I still believe that.

24:16.481 --> 24:17.617
I do.

24:21.816 --> 24:23.387
But seeing Shawn lying there...

24:23.521 --> 24:25.085
You might want to remember that feeling

24:25.205 --> 24:27.427
the next time Collier
hands down orders.

24:29.544 --> 24:31.741
Look, I don't want to lecture you,

24:32.090 --> 24:34.691
but you don't know what it is
to worry about you the way I do.

24:35.253 --> 24:37.554
Every time I hear something
about Collier on the news,

24:38.162 --> 24:40.775
every time I pick up
the paper in the morning,

24:40.918 --> 24:43.166
I'm afraid that I'm going
to learn that you're in jail,

24:43.286 --> 24:44.475
or that you're dead.

24:47.084 --> 24:50.014
I don't see how it could
end any other way for you.

24:53.668 --> 24:54.898
We could win.

24:56.258 --> 24:57.560
We could save the world.

24:57.680 --> 25:00.625
Well, I want a son,
not a martyr for Collier's cause.

25:06.723 --> 25:08.253
Dad, that's enough gauze.

25:14.270 --> 25:16.289
I'm sorry.
I guess I never stop being a dad.

25:21.744 --> 25:23.415
I think Marco's got something.

25:24.969 --> 25:27.938
That's it. The dead end
of this hallway on sub-level 11.

25:28.058 --> 25:30.117
That's the farthest point
in the building from our office.

25:30.237 --> 25:33.088
If P.J.'s back door is anywhere,
that's the spot.

25:33.208 --> 25:34.833
- All right, I'll go.
- Not alone, you won't.

25:34.953 --> 25:36.138
This whole building is one big trap.

25:36.258 --> 25:37.734
We're not sending you
out there on your own.

25:37.854 --> 25:39.065
He won't be alone.

25:39.461 --> 25:41.607
As far as I know,
I'm the only one who can end this.

25:41.727 --> 25:44.109
I have to be the one
to walk through that door.

25:47.282 --> 25:49.491
All right, get yourself ready.
We're leaving in 2 min.

25:49.611 --> 25:50.857
I'm going with you.

25:51.057 --> 25:53.892
This is supposed to be
an exercise in cooperation.

25:54.294 --> 25:56.219
I think it's fitting
we divide the risk.

26:17.416 --> 26:19.116
I'm thinking
we should take the stairs.

26:27.589 --> 26:29.880
You cared about Shawn, didn't you?

26:31.428 --> 26:34.301
Shawn was just a little kid
when his father left my sister.

26:41.295 --> 26:42.944
I tried to take an interest in him,

26:43.064 --> 26:44.656
do what I could
to help raise him.

26:45.086 --> 26:46.739
Well, you did a fine job.

26:48.016 --> 26:49.537
He was an extraordinary...

26:49.716 --> 26:52.871
He is...
an extraordinary young man.

26:55.140 --> 26:56.614
He and I have grown apart.

26:57.412 --> 26:59.562
It's difficult,
losing someone you've...

27:01.525 --> 27:03.149
You've invested so much time in.

27:03.740 --> 27:05.571
You made that bed for yourself.

27:06.172 --> 27:09.354
Shawn broke off from you because
he didn't agree with what you believe in

27:09.474 --> 27:11.193
and you were too rigid to change.

27:11.615 --> 27:13.545
Isn't that why Kyle
pulled away from you?

27:13.665 --> 27:16.676
Hey, don't compare
the two situations.

27:17.048 --> 27:19.663
For one thing if it wasn't for you,
we wouldn't be standing here

27:19.783 --> 27:21.523
wondering whether
Shawn was alive or dead.

27:21.643 --> 27:24.239
You put the shots out there,
which is why he could take one,

27:24.398 --> 27:26.568
and that's why two people
I care about might be dead.

27:26.688 --> 27:29.625
The spread of promicin is not to blame.
The fear of it is.

27:29.804 --> 27:32.049
Your government prevents
people who've taken the shot

27:32.169 --> 27:34.198
from learning
how to control their abilities.

27:34.318 --> 27:36.031
You've criminalized the gifted.

27:36.151 --> 27:38.816
So what? We should all just step
aside and let you run the world?

27:39.789 --> 27:41.648
Can you two ever stop arguing?

27:41.805 --> 27:44.257
You are literally going
to get us all killed!

27:44.377 --> 27:45.689
If you can't calm down,

27:45.809 --> 27:47.893
you both might as well
go back to OPS right now.

27:48.013 --> 27:49.620
I'll find the way out myself.

27:55.345 --> 27:56.810
These are the stairs. Let's go.

28:01.325 --> 28:02.677
Would you mind going first?

28:06.514 --> 28:07.763
I got your back.

28:10.584 --> 28:13.474
If this back door thing doesn't work out
we're gonna need another plan.

28:13.594 --> 28:15.987
We already know we can't
get to the generators, so...

28:19.522 --> 28:20.893
Maia, what are you doing?

28:22.808 --> 28:24.012
I'm just helping kyle.

28:24.132 --> 28:25.751
We don't know this
place as well as you guys,

28:25.871 --> 28:27.222
but we might as well pitch in.

28:27.342 --> 28:29.335
I mean, who knows?
Maybe we'll come up with something.

28:29.455 --> 28:31.907
Okay, that's great.
Maia, will you go stand with Marco?

28:32.186 --> 28:34.289
- Mom, we're just trying to...
- Go now.

28:47.188 --> 28:50.259
You know, I want to get out of here too,
just the same way you do.

28:52.051 --> 28:53.205
I know you hate me.

28:54.238 --> 28:57.327
Tell you the truth, I don't blame you,
but you do need to work with me.

28:57.748 --> 28:58.893
That's the game.

29:02.179 --> 29:04.254
You threatened my daughter's life.

29:04.580 --> 29:05.707
I know.

29:06.122 --> 29:07.671
You shot me for it, remember?

29:07.803 --> 29:10.979
Yeah, six times,
more if I could have reloaded.

29:12.026 --> 29:15.848
I really don't care what this little
exercise is supposed to be about.

29:16.954 --> 29:18.822
You just stay the hell away
from Maia.

29:27.173 --> 29:28.694
Maia, come over here.

29:39.340 --> 29:40.486
That's it.

29:41.065 --> 29:43.553
If we can get through that door,
that should be the way out.

30:00.739 --> 30:02.053
Let me try.

30:19.339 --> 30:20.465
That's me.

30:21.367 --> 30:22.419
My bedroom.

30:26.502 --> 30:28.615
Looks like we found our back door.

30:34.198 --> 30:36.574
I know I'm going to jail
when we all wake up.

30:37.439 --> 30:38.462
Just...

30:39.890 --> 30:41.609
make sure everyone knows
I'm sorry.

30:58.755 --> 30:59.985
He's dead.

31:01.253 --> 31:02.262
It's gone.

31:02.382 --> 31:03.689
The way out, it's gone.

31:13.105 --> 31:14.175
That won't work.

31:14.776 --> 31:16.910
P.J. said he's the only
one who can end this early.

31:17.030 --> 31:18.996
Yeah, well, I'm not giving up.

31:19.116 --> 31:21.355
Neither am I.
The back door was just that,

31:21.741 --> 31:23.760
a way out, one option.
There is another.

31:25.112 --> 31:26.117
We play out the game.

31:26.237 --> 31:27.666
Try to survive. Win.

31:28.118 --> 31:29.463
- Win?
- P.J. said there was

31:29.583 --> 31:31.349
a goal to every game,
an end point.

31:32.288 --> 31:34.522
- We don't know what that is.
- Not yet,

31:34.949 --> 31:38.045
but I doubt we'll find it down here.
We head back up to the operations room,

31:38.165 --> 31:40.078
we stick together,
figure out a way to live.

31:40.608 --> 31:41.698
Wait a second.

31:41.951 --> 31:43.773
Is it me or is it
getting hotter in here?

31:47.308 --> 31:49.496
That air's got to be
well over a hundred degrees.

31:52.038 --> 31:53.897
So this place is going to cook us all?

31:54.017 --> 31:55.777
I don't know about you guys,
but personally

31:55.897 --> 31:58.089
I'd rather be electrocuted
than fricasseed.

31:58.420 --> 31:59.810
Nobody's getting cooked.

32:00.101 --> 32:02.327
The environmental controls
are just a few floors down.

32:02.447 --> 32:04.505
We can change
the temperature manually.

32:05.362 --> 32:07.246
It won't work.
The temperature control

32:07.366 --> 32:08.970
runs through
the main computer network,

32:09.092 --> 32:10.808
and we still can't access the system.

32:11.556 --> 32:13.049
We need to kill the building.

32:16.680 --> 32:18.136
This place runs on power.

32:18.561 --> 32:20.965
We take that away,
it can't hurt us anymore.

32:21.475 --> 32:23.127
We shut the building down, we win.

32:23.247 --> 32:25.529
Cut the power, you don't think
we've thought about that?

32:25.651 --> 32:28.003
The emergency generators
are sealed off.

32:29.105 --> 32:31.978
Well... it's actually
not that bad of an idea.

32:32.700 --> 32:35.696
Look, we can't shut the generators down
because we can't get to them,

32:36.030 --> 32:38.725
but if we could find a way
to create an electrical surge...

32:39.041 --> 32:41.048
big enough to overload
the emergency systems...

32:41.168 --> 32:43.429
There'd be a power outage.
This place would go black.

32:44.975 --> 32:47.942
There's two major power relays that
run throughout this entire building.

32:48.122 --> 32:50.146
Our everyday system
and the emergency line.

32:50.588 --> 32:53.401
If we can find a place where
the 2 relays run close to each other...

32:53.521 --> 32:54.937
Connect the two lines and "zap"!

32:55.191 --> 32:56.318
Short the building out.

33:02.718 --> 33:05.409
There. We keep all the computer
servers in that room.

33:05.529 --> 33:07.770
Every power conduit in the building
runs through there.

33:09.897 --> 33:12.090
If P.J. hasn't gotten us
out of here in two minutes,

33:12.210 --> 33:14.052
Marco, you and I
are heading to that room.

33:16.599 --> 33:18.670
You find the longest
power cord you can

33:18.790 --> 33:21.354
and strip the insulation off of it.
You're coming with us.

33:22.024 --> 33:23.188
It's your idea.

33:23.751 --> 33:25.553
You should have
a chance to see it through.

33:29.212 --> 33:30.358
What is that?

33:30.599 --> 33:31.894
Um, the building.

33:32.138 --> 33:33.434
I don't think it likes our plan.

33:35.417 --> 33:36.525
What's happening?

33:36.645 --> 33:38.628
It's not blowing air
into the room anymore.

33:38.987 --> 33:40.114
It's sucking it out.

33:42.704 --> 33:44.921
Okay, guys,
we're not waiting two minutes.

33:45.041 --> 33:46.348
We're all going now.

33:56.263 --> 33:57.784
The blast doors are down.

34:00.285 --> 34:02.078
- <i>Hello!</i>
- Stay there.

34:04.265 --> 34:06.453
- <i>Dad!</i>
- Kyle, what's happening?

34:06.651 --> 34:09.786
The building shut us off!
Sucking all the air out of the room!

34:10.097 --> 34:13.177
<i>Tom, I don't think
we've got much time!</i>

34:14.862 --> 34:17.496
You have to try
and short-circuit the building's

34:17.703 --> 34:19.027
<i>power supply!</i>

34:30.469 --> 34:32.722
- This was all I could find.
- We need to run that cord

34:32.844 --> 34:34.257
between these two power relays.

34:34.378 --> 34:36.688
If Marco's right,
that'll shut this place down.

34:40.237 --> 34:41.643
This is not nearly long enough.

34:41.763 --> 34:43.063
Then find more!

34:45.813 --> 34:47.288
These power lines are all...

34:47.588 --> 34:49.081
They're all sealed into the wall.

34:50.167 --> 34:53.237
If we could rip these
out of the ceiling.

34:53.407 --> 34:55.632
No, they're dying in that room.
We don't have time.

34:59.461 --> 35:00.466
There is one way

35:01.125 --> 35:03.097
to complete the connection
between these relays.

35:04.365 --> 35:05.454
Us.

35:05.923 --> 35:07.567
We complete the circuit ourselves.

35:12.039 --> 35:13.246
You're talking about...

35:13.366 --> 35:15.889
running thousands of volts
of electricity through our bodies.

35:16.830 --> 35:17.966
We'll die.

35:18.537 --> 35:19.580
We will,

35:20.263 --> 35:22.009
but if your colleagues are right...

35:24.565 --> 35:25.861
We'll end this thing.

35:33.875 --> 35:35.049
So how about it?

35:36.734 --> 35:39.223
You don't strike me
as a man afraid of a sacrifice.

35:52.729 --> 35:55.783
I keep telling myself it's just a game,
but you know what?

35:56.030 --> 35:57.392
I still don't feel like dying.

35:57.832 --> 35:59.898
It's not an experience
I'm looking to revisit.

36:01.211 --> 36:03.185
Well, I guess it's like
you're always saying...

36:04.161 --> 36:05.550
Just have to have faith.

36:14.396 --> 36:15.992
- On three?
- On three.

36:18.273 --> 36:19.277
One...

36:20.712 --> 36:21.810
Two...

36:25.248 --> 36:26.281
Three!

36:57.393 --> 36:58.464
Mommy!

37:02.385 --> 37:05.183
Sweetheart, you okay?

37:24.325 --> 37:25.517
You're okay.

37:26.637 --> 37:27.830
You're not hurt.

37:32.462 --> 37:33.598
I'm fine.

37:39.840 --> 37:41.004
Is Jordan here?

37:41.389 --> 37:42.591
Have you seen him?

37:56.990 --> 37:58.690
Can I talk to Tom Baldwin, please?

38:10.591 --> 38:11.662
Hi.

38:14.233 --> 38:15.924
We, uh... we picked up P.J.

38:16.222 --> 38:18.938
After he woke up,
he tried to make a run for Promise City,

38:19.058 --> 38:20.260
and, uh, we...

38:28.213 --> 38:29.950
I'm fine, really.

38:30.765 --> 38:31.789
It's okay.

38:32.723 --> 38:34.216
I'm sorry.
It's just...

38:36.188 --> 38:37.428
I watched you die last night.

38:37.548 --> 38:39.888
You have no idea how good it is
to see you right now.

38:44.403 --> 38:46.159
I'm sorry that things got...

38:46.858 --> 38:47.971
so out of hand,

38:48.654 --> 38:51.293
and I know I'm going to jail
for taking the shot,

38:52.259 --> 38:54.729
so it's probably
the wrong time to say this,

38:55.435 --> 38:56.440
but...

38:57.351 --> 38:59.191
if everything you told me is true,

39:00.175 --> 39:01.461
maybe it'll be worth it,

39:02.004 --> 39:03.177
playing the game.

39:04.539 --> 39:05.813
How could you say that?

39:07.278 --> 39:08.940
It was scared,

39:09.841 --> 39:11.672
but my ability worked.

39:13.171 --> 39:15.969
Jordan Collier and Tom Baldwin

39:16.147 --> 39:17.574
actually cooperated.

39:18.297 --> 39:21.847
They sacrificed themselves
to save the other players.

39:22.927 --> 39:24.664
That has to mean something, right?

39:26.086 --> 39:27.270
Let's hope so.

39:27.390 --> 39:29.663
I'd hate to think you gave up
your freedom for nothing.

39:30.644 --> 39:33.564
Someone will be here shortly
to take you downstairs.

39:51.326 --> 39:52.696
Are you okay?

39:54.202 --> 39:57.113
It's going to be strange
not having P.J. in the office anymore.

39:58.008 --> 39:59.920
Yeah, I know it's not P.C.,

40:00.040 --> 40:02.299
but I kind of admire what he did.

40:03.007 --> 40:04.322
You know, I know Jordan Collier

40:04.442 --> 40:06.472
a hell of a lot better
than I did a day ago,

40:06.923 --> 40:09.430
and he knows us.
That's got to be a good thing.

40:09.657 --> 40:11.037
Yeah, well...

40:11.427 --> 40:12.845
We'll see about that.

40:15.342 --> 40:16.731
Marco, I...

40:19.517 --> 40:22.456
Was Maia right?
Have things gotten weird between us?

40:25.211 --> 40:26.769
Kind of hard to avoid, right?

40:28.353 --> 40:29.658
You broke up with me,

40:30.131 --> 40:31.699
and I still have to see you
every day.

40:33.749 --> 40:35.844
Well, if you're up for it,

40:35.964 --> 40:38.040
I really would like to be friends,

40:38.806 --> 40:39.931
and I promised Maia

40:40.051 --> 40:42.226
that I would cook a meatloaf
tomorrow night, and...

40:42.983 --> 40:44.245
Maybe you could come by.

40:44.365 --> 40:45.977
I know that
she would really like that.

40:46.163 --> 40:47.196
So would I.

40:48.948 --> 40:51.061
The infamous Skouris meatloaf.

40:51.554 --> 40:53.451
It's gotten better, I promise.

40:56.410 --> 40:57.556
Will I see you then?

41:08.171 --> 41:09.448
<i>Your son's fine.</i>

41:10.439 --> 41:11.538
<i>We all are.</i>

41:15.277 --> 41:16.554
I wanted you to know.

41:20.304 --> 41:21.653
Well, I appreciate that.

41:21.773 --> 41:23.581
I've been leaving
him messages all morning.

41:25.414 --> 41:27.217
I talked to shawn a while ago.
He's...

41:28.018 --> 41:29.276
He's doing all righ, too.

41:29.874 --> 41:31.865
I don't want
any misunderstanding.

41:32.222 --> 41:33.977
Nothing's changed between us.

41:35.095 --> 41:38.146
I'm still gonna give promicin to anyone
who wants to make a difference.

41:38.869 --> 41:40.668
<i>And I will still build Promise City.</i>

41:40.788 --> 41:42.396
And you're gonna wind up
in handcuff,

41:42.516 --> 41:44.397
and I'm gonna be
the one putting them on you.

41:47.493 --> 41:49.090
You called me Jordan just then.

41:56.869 --> 41:58.109
I guess I did.

41:59.962 --> 42:01.680
P.J. accomplished that much, anyway.

42:03.795 --> 42:05.870
So... Tom...

42:07.525 --> 42:10.164
Would you like to hang up,
or shall I?
