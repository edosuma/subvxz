two of your boys back into town with me.

You're outside your jurisdiction, marshal.

<i>HITCH: Like my father, I'd been West Point,
and I was good at soldiering.</i>

03:04.268 --> 03:07.897
<i>But soldiering didn't allow
for much expansion of the soul.</i>

03:08.072 --> 03:11.735
<i>So after the War Between the States
and a year of fighting Indians...</i>

03:11.909 --> 03:16.710
<i>... I turned in my commission and rode away
to see how much I could expand it.</i>

03:17.582 --> 03:20.710
<i>First time I met Virgil Cole
was when I and my eight-gauge...</i>

03:20.885 --> 03:23.012

he was having...</i>

03:23.187 --> 03:25.280

03:25.456 --> 03:28.448
<i>Virgil asked me on the spot
if I'd care to partner up with him...</i>

03:28.626 --> 03:30.856
<i>... and his peacekeeping business.</i>

03:31.028 --> 03:35.294
<i>Which is why I was with him now,
and why I still carry the eight-gauge.</i>

03:36.667 --> 03:40.364
<i>We'd been keeping the peace together
for the last dozen years or so.</i>

03:40.838 --> 03:44.069

on a town called Appaloosa...</i>

03:44.242 --> 03:46.938

that we'd be doing just that...</i>

- He's after the copper fields.
- Earl.

- Let Abner speak, please.

05:15.299 --> 05:16.823

Something to warm you up a little bit.

- Well, thank you, Randall.
- Sitting lonely in the corner...

Aw.

Ever seen one like that?

01:37:21.953 --> 01:37:25.320
Olson says Bragg bought it in England.

One fella told me the other day
Bragg had a big silver strike up in Nevada.

01:37:42.473 --> 01:37:46.876
Another swears Bragg and some boys
robbed a train down in Mexico...

01:37:47.044 --> 01:37:49.171
...carrying gold.

01:37:53.017 --> 01:37:57.351
I don't suppose it matters one way

Talked this over with Allie?

01:38:47.572 --> 01:38:49.631
She don't wanna leave either?

- She might leave me.

Yeah.

- You saw how it was with Ring Shelton.
- I ain't leaving her.
