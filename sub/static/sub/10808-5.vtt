00:03.103 --> 00:06.072
(theme music playing)

00:19.753 --> 00:24.558
NARRATOR:
Man lives in the sunlit world

00:24.558 --> 00:29.018
of what he believes
to be reality.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.968
But... there is,

00:33.968 --> 00:38.505
unseen by most, an underworld.

00:38.505 --> 00:42.176
A place that is just as real

00:42.176 --> 00:46.280
but not as brightly lit.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.044
A dark side.

01:19.013 --> 01:21.004
J‘J‘

01:29.123 --> 01:30.613
Salud.

01:32.626 --> 01:35.462
MAN (grunts):
Mm...

01:35.462 --> 01:37.364
Doll, have a little
of this caviar.

01:37.364 --> 01:38.532
Put hair on your chest.

01:38.532 --> 01:40.934
Oh, come on, Eddie.
Can't we go home and go to bed?

01:40.934 --> 01:42.169
I don't like this.

01:42.169 --> 01:45.005
Hey, I got a right to celebrate.
This is my night.

01:45.005 --> 01:47.508
Yeah, but people celebrate
in a disco or a nightclub,

01:47.508 --> 01:49.710
not some lousy
stinkin' warehouse.

01:49.710 --> 01:52.012
This is the way I always
planned it in my head!

01:52.012 --> 01:54.114
You know how long I been
waiting for this night?

01:54.114 --> 01:55.149
18 years.

01:55.149 --> 01:57.584
18 years...
I been dreaming about

01:57.584 --> 02:00.554
what I would do when I reached
out my hand and took it all.

02:00.554 --> 02:03.457
It don't seem right
to celebrate, that's all.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.659
With Paulie not even cold yet.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.161
Paulie's feeling no pain.

02:07.161 --> 02:09.823
He's happy wherever he is.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.132
(door opens)

02:12.132 --> 02:14.001
Hey, they're here.

02:14.001 --> 02:16.770
Hey, what took you guys so long?

02:16.770 --> 02:18.672
l was getting ready
to call the police!

02:18.672 --> 02:20.908
(laughs)

02:20.908 --> 02:25.112
Well, Mr. De Calasuro,
what a pleasure this is.

02:25.112 --> 02:28.816
Hey, doll, I want you to meet
the world's greatest puppeteer.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.451
Did you lock the door?

02:30.451 --> 02:31.552
Good.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.543
You got the hooks?

02:36.223 --> 02:37.891
l was just telling
my friend here

02:37.891 --> 02:40.394
what a great puppet act you got.

02:40.394 --> 02:42.296
You like caviar?

02:42.296 --> 02:44.231
Got beluga-- only the best.

02:44.231 --> 02:46.066
No, thanks.
lt-lt makes me ill.

02:46.066 --> 02:48.736
(chuckles softly)

02:48.736 --> 02:51.772
This man woke me up
in the middle of the night.

02:51.772 --> 02:52.806
I need my sleep.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.408
Wh-Why have you
brought me here?

02:54.408 --> 02:56.710
Hey, I'm a big fan of yours.

02:56.710 --> 03:00.481
Have been for years.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.382
You're the greatest.

03:02.382 --> 03:06.186
In fact, uh, you've been
kind of an inspiration to me.

03:06.186 --> 03:09.757
Anyway, uh, tonight,
I made a big killing in, uh...

03:09.757 --> 03:12.025
in my business.

03:12.025 --> 03:15.329
You're looking at a man
who's made it to the top.

03:15.329 --> 03:18.098
And | always thought
when I made it big,

03:18.098 --> 03:20.501
l was gonna treat myself
to a private performance

03:20.501 --> 03:23.129
of the world's greatest
puppet act.

03:28.075 --> 03:29.565
My puppet.

03:33.447 --> 03:34.948
You-You had
no right to move him.

03:34.948 --> 03:36.884
He's very delicate.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.952
You must have broke into
the Lyceum Theatre

03:38.952 --> 03:41.088
to get my equipment like this.

03:41.088 --> 03:43.223
You got it right, pops.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.391
Now start the show.

03:44.391 --> 03:45.824
We ain't got all night, huh?

03:49.563 --> 03:50.764
That's right.

03:50.764 --> 03:53.100
Do it for me like you did
in Atlantic City.

03:53.100 --> 03:56.270
Oh, my baby, did they hurt you?

03:56.270 --> 03:57.938
What have they done to you?

03:57.938 --> 03:59.740
You all right, huh?

03:59.740 --> 04:01.108
Come on, pops.

04:01.108 --> 04:03.677
Let's get to work.

04:03.677 --> 04:06.180
You'll love this guy, doll,
he's the greatest.

04:06.180 --> 04:09.115
| just want to get this
over with and get out of here.

04:10.317 --> 04:12.519
-(piano playing simple melody)
-J‘ I'm your puppet J‘

04:12.519 --> 04:14.154
J‘ Play with me J‘

04:14.154 --> 04:17.324
J‘ Tell me what you want to see J‘

04:17.324 --> 04:20.727
J‘ I can move my dancing feet J‘

04:20.727 --> 04:23.931
J‘ Though I'm not
made out of meat J‘

04:23.931 --> 04:27.367
J‘ Watch me wiggle,
watch me shake J‘

04:27.367 --> 04:30.671
J‘ Like a hootchy-kootchy snake J‘

04:30.671 --> 04:33.807
J‘ I'm your puppet,
yes, it's true J‘

04:33.807 --> 04:37.744
J‘ I'll do anything
you want me to. J‘

04:37.744 --> 04:39.012
Terrific! Terrific!

04:39.012 --> 04:40.447
I love it!

04:40.447 --> 04:43.016
Hey, come out here;
I want to ask you a question.

04:43.016 --> 04:44.985
Isn't he great?
Didn't I tell you, doll?

04:44.985 --> 04:46.420
You told me, Eddie.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.654
What did you want to ask?

04:47.654 --> 04:49.790
Hey, how do you do that
with such a big puppet?

04:49.790 --> 04:52.059
Well, it's all in the rigging.

04:52.059 --> 04:55.596
I use counterweights,
so the size is no problem.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.865
Well, how big a puppet
do you think you can handle?

04:57.865 --> 04:58.966
Oh, I don't know.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.535
Uh, up to 200 pounds, I suppose.

05:01.535 --> 05:04.037
Oh, I got a great idea
to liven up your act.

05:04.037 --> 05:06.139
Come here, let me show you
what I mean.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.507
Eddie, don't!

05:07.507 --> 05:08.842
Don't go through with this.

05:08.842 --> 05:11.811
Will you shut up and get rid of
the fish eggs, huh?

05:13.814 --> 05:15.247
Broads.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.952
Look, um, ljust happen
to have here

05:18.952 --> 05:20.587
a sensational puppet for you.

05:20.587 --> 05:22.122
l-l don't need a new puppet.

05:22.122 --> 05:24.291
l'm-l'm happy
with the one l have.

05:24.291 --> 05:26.191
Yeah, well,
wait till you see this one.

06:00.594 --> 06:01.929
Who was that?

06:01.929 --> 06:04.698
That's Fat Paulie,
my former business partner.

06:04.698 --> 06:08.031
He died suddenly, of old age...
about an hour ago.

06:14.675 --> 06:16.609
Don't treat him that way!

06:18.979 --> 06:21.815
ljust gave him new paint.

06:21.815 --> 06:22.883
He chips so easily.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.118
You have to be
delicate with him.

06:25.118 --> 06:26.745
He's very sensitive.

06:28.855 --> 06:30.516
This is sick, Eddie.

06:34.161 --> 06:35.651
(dull squish)

06:43.370 --> 06:44.871
(dull squish)

06:44.871 --> 06:47.007
I'm getting a creepy feeling.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.942
Why don't you just forget
the whole thing, Eddie?

06:48.942 --> 06:50.944
I don't want to forget
the whole thing.

06:50.944 --> 06:53.513
From now on,
I do exactly what I want.

06:53.513 --> 06:55.140
Everywhere.

06:58.018 --> 07:00.287
Okay, you, start your act again.

07:00.287 --> 07:02.923
Only, this time,
I got some new words for you.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.192
Uh, l-l'm an old man.

07:05.192 --> 07:07.894
l... I don't have
my reading glasses.

07:07.894 --> 07:10.297
l have to hold everything
very far away.

07:10.297 --> 07:12.699
Oh, that's okay.
Uh, Nick'll hold 'em for you.

07:12.699 --> 07:14.468
(dull squish)

07:14.468 --> 07:18.271
I been working on these lines
in my head for 18 years.

07:18.271 --> 07:22.409
And I'm gonna hear 'em tonight,
or my name ain't Eddie Minelli.

07:22.409 --> 07:24.644
H... I won't do this.

07:24.644 --> 07:27.114
You'll do what I tell you.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.482
Pick them up.

07:28.482 --> 07:29.649
No.

07:29.649 --> 07:30.884
You got to do it.

07:30.884 --> 07:33.153
Eddie always gets his way.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.154
No.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.522
lt's-lt's okay, Nick.

07:35.522 --> 07:36.923
l'll handle this.

07:36.923 --> 07:38.550
Grab those papers.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.824
So you want
some encouragement, huh?

07:44.831 --> 07:48.769
Well... here's some
encouragement, okay?

07:48.769 --> 07:51.071
That's more than you ever got
for one performance

07:51.071 --> 07:52.706
in your whole life.

07:52.706 --> 07:55.075
And more than
you'll ever get again.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.744
I give you
my personal guarantee.

07:57.744 --> 07:59.513
(dull squish)

07:59.513 --> 08:01.848
You don't understand.

08:01.848 --> 08:05.886
Puppetry is a very ancient art.

08:05.886 --> 08:09.456
It's a kind of holy thing.

08:09.456 --> 08:11.625
It would be a profanation
of that art

08:11.625 --> 08:14.795
if I were to do
this kind of thing.

08:14.795 --> 08:18.165
If I were to be a party
to this kind of...

08:18.165 --> 08:22.569
obscenity, who can tell
what could happen?

08:22.569 --> 08:24.805
The gods of puppetry
might desert me.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.973
l... I can't take that risk.

08:26.973 --> 08:29.042
Don't feed me that garbage.

08:29.042 --> 08:31.278
You're just a grown man
who plays with dolls.

08:31.278 --> 08:34.347
You think it's easy
to do what I do?

08:34.347 --> 08:36.683
To take a piece of wood
and make it come alive

08:36.683 --> 08:38.985
just by wiggling it
in a certain way?

08:38.985 --> 08:40.287
(chuckles) You try it,

08:40.287 --> 08:41.655
if you think it's so simple!

08:41.655 --> 08:42.656
It's a gift!

08:42.656 --> 08:44.424
Those who have it--

08:44.424 --> 08:48.595
they touch the strings,
and it's magic.

08:48.595 --> 08:52.065
The people laugh, they believe.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.834
They see themselves up there.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.769
Why, you can make them cry.

08:55.769 --> 08:58.105
You can make them
stand up and applaud.

08:58.105 --> 09:00.335
You can make them shout,
"Look out behind you!"

09:02.309 --> 09:05.045
That kind of power,

09:05.045 --> 09:09.716
the power to make people feel...

09:09.716 --> 09:13.053
it can disappear
just as soon as it came.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.922
You don't know diddly-squat
about power.

09:15.922 --> 09:17.824
Power's there for the taking.

09:17.824 --> 09:20.093
You just have to reach out
and grab it,

09:20.093 --> 09:22.028
and hold on and don't let go,

09:22.028 --> 09:24.724
or else somebody else
will take it away from you.

09:26.566 --> 09:29.102
Power's just like a woman.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.605
It goes to
the strongest man around.

09:31.605 --> 09:33.240
I'm not gonna take this anymore!

09:33.240 --> 09:34.274
I'm going home!

09:34.274 --> 09:36.009
You'll never find a cab.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.010
|'|| walk.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.044
Come back here!

09:38.044 --> 09:40.580
Don't take another step.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.450
Door's locked, remember?

09:43.450 --> 09:45.441
And I got the key.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.356
That's right, doll.

09:49.356 --> 09:50.757
Put your behind in that chair,

09:50.757 --> 09:53.326
and don't move again
unless I say so.

09:53.326 --> 09:54.350
Hey, Nick!

09:55.996 --> 09:57.731
What's holding things up?

09:57.731 --> 10:00.133
I'm doing the best I can.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.930
The lousy hook
keeps coming loose.

10:03.503 --> 10:05.172
Ah, ya dumb jerkle.

10:05.172 --> 10:07.163
Can't you do anything right?

10:10.043 --> 10:12.045
Eh.
Use the bullet holes, Nicky.

10:12.045 --> 10:14.481
What do you think
they're there for, ventilation?

10:14.481 --> 10:16.249
If you want anything
done right around here,

10:16.249 --> 10:17.684
ya gotta do it yourself.

10:17.684 --> 10:20.287
l appeal to you,
in the name of decency...

10:20.287 --> 10:22.556
Okay. POPS.
let's get on with the show.

10:22.556 --> 10:24.457
I refuse.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.928
If you want so badly to put on
this obscene spectacle,

10:27.928 --> 10:29.396
then do it yourself.

10:29.396 --> 10:31.431
With the help of
this half-witted moron here,

10:31.431 --> 10:34.935
but not with Aldo De Calasuro.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.803
You missed the point, pops.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.838
This ain't
dealer's choice tonight.

10:38.838 --> 10:43.143
You play by the house rules,
or you end up in the toilet.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.512
(laughs)
I thought you'd see it my way.

10:45.512 --> 10:47.147
Everybody does, sooner or later.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.182
Ain't that right, Tiff?

10:49.182 --> 10:51.173
TIFFANY:
That's right, Eddie.

11:15.141 --> 11:16.476
(crying quietly)

11:16.476 --> 11:19.479
What's the matter with you?

11:19.479 --> 11:22.182
l was just thinking
about Paulie.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.183
(sighs)

11:23.183 --> 11:25.819
He was always so nice to me.

11:25.819 --> 11:29.189
He always asked after me.

11:29.189 --> 11:33.226
He sent me flowers on my
birthday... every year.

11:33.226 --> 11:34.594
Flowers?

11:34.594 --> 11:36.363
I don't know nothing
about flowers.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.965
I threw 'em away
before you got home.

11:38.965 --> 11:40.800
I knew you'd be jealous.

11:40.800 --> 11:41.801
So what's the point?

11:41.801 --> 11:43.670
You mean you're crying over
a couple of bunches of flowers?

11:43.670 --> 11:46.339
I'm crying about me.

11:46.339 --> 11:48.441
You use people, Eddie.

11:48.441 --> 11:52.112
You use 'em up and you
throw 'em away like Kleenex.

11:52.112 --> 11:54.748
l was just thinking about
what's gonna happen

11:54.748 --> 11:56.650
when you're through with me.

11:56.650 --> 11:58.652
Got nothing to worry about.

11:58.652 --> 12:01.154
You're fixed for life.
You got the condo in your name.

12:01.154 --> 12:03.223
You got the house
at the beach, the Rolls-Royce.

12:03.223 --> 12:06.126
So turn off the
waterworks, okay?

12:06.126 --> 12:07.460
All right, I'm ready.

12:07.460 --> 12:08.995
Trim the counterweights.

12:08.995 --> 12:09.996
The what?

12:09.996 --> 12:11.631
Pull down on the handle

12:11.631 --> 12:13.599
to lift the puppet
up out of its box!

12:15.302 --> 12:19.139
He was always so
gentle with me.

12:19.139 --> 12:22.008
Look, Tiffany, I know you
used to go with him before me.

12:22.008 --> 12:23.877
Just don't rub it in.

12:23.877 --> 12:25.679
Before, Eddie, not after!

12:25.679 --> 12:27.347
Before, after--
what's the difference?

12:27.347 --> 12:29.349
It's the same thing.
Just don't bring it up.

12:29.349 --> 12:30.684
Not tonight.

12:30.684 --> 12:32.709
It's a bad time to cross me.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.092
Hey, what's the
hang-up back here?

12:39.092 --> 12:40.694
We ain't doin'
Gone With the Wind.

12:40.694 --> 12:42.329
Now let's get this
show on the road

12:42.329 --> 12:44.264
before the star is
too stiff to perform.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.255
-0kay?
-Yeah!

12:48.201 --> 12:49.703
Come on.

12:49.703 --> 12:52.263
Go on, put your back into it!

12:53.606 --> 12:55.096
(muffled):
If it's a trick...

12:56.176 --> 12:59.479
(rattling)

12:59.479 --> 13:01.572
(Eddie applauding)

13:03.983 --> 13:06.653
Way to go, Paulie!

13:06.653 --> 13:09.645
Now I got you just where
| always wanted you.

13:15.395 --> 13:18.398
(wind whooshing)

13:18.398 --> 13:20.266
I thought you said
the door was locked.

13:20.266 --> 13:21.501
It was, I swear.

13:21.501 --> 13:24.003
lt's Paulie's soul come back.

13:24.003 --> 13:26.494
Shut up! It's only the wind.

13:27.607 --> 13:30.844
(whispering):
Forgive me, please.

13:30.844 --> 13:32.778
Forgive me.

13:37.684 --> 13:40.881
(wind whipping)

13:45.258 --> 13:48.250
(wind howling)

13:49.262 --> 13:50.930
(wind howling)

13:50.930 --> 13:53.262
Stupid! The bolt's broke!

13:54.534 --> 13:56.936
Look, grab that piece of wood.

13:56.936 --> 13:58.597
Look, shove it under the door.

14:04.778 --> 14:06.279
Huh.

14:06.279 --> 14:08.679
You should've noticed
the bolt was broke.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.217
(exhales)

14:11.217 --> 14:13.987
I swear the door was locked.

14:13.987 --> 14:16.156
The wind must've
broke the bolt.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.057
Well, take a hell of a
wind to do that.

14:18.057 --> 14:19.726
It was shut tight.

14:19.726 --> 14:21.127
I tried it myself.

14:21.127 --> 14:25.131
Listen, I don't carry no
deadweight on my payroll.

14:25.131 --> 14:26.800
Now, you start using your head

14:26.800 --> 14:28.802
and pay more attention
to detail,

14:28.802 --> 14:31.004
or you're gonna
end up like Paulie--

14:31.004 --> 14:33.438
on the wrong end of a hook.

14:41.281 --> 14:42.615
What happened?

14:42.615 --> 14:44.984
Eh, the wind blew
the door open, that's all.

14:44.984 --> 14:47.976
You mean you forgot
to lock the door, dummy.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.157
That was a cold wind, Eddie.

14:51.157 --> 14:53.159
Cold like the grave.

14:53.159 --> 14:55.462
Quit trying to spook me.

14:55.462 --> 14:56.996
It don't work.

14:56.996 --> 14:59.365
Okay, everybody, it's showtime!

14:59.365 --> 15:01.835
(gentle waltz playing)

15:01.835 --> 15:05.371
J‘ I'm your puppet,
play with me J‘

15:05.371 --> 15:08.608
J‘ Tell me what you want to see J‘

15:08.608 --> 15:11.244
J‘ I can move my dancing feet J‘

15:11.244 --> 15:14.514
J‘ Though I'm not made
out of meat... J‘

15:14.514 --> 15:16.505
I can't do this.

15:17.517 --> 15:19.152
J‘ Watch me wiggle J‘

15:19.152 --> 15:24.057
J‘ Watch me shake
like a hootchy-kootchy snake J‘

15:24.057 --> 15:26.993
J‘ I'm your puppet,
yes, it's true J‘

15:26.993 --> 15:29.896
J‘ I'll do anything
you want me to. J‘

15:29.896 --> 15:32.866
(Eddie guffawing)

15:32.866 --> 15:34.200
EDDIE:
Terrific!

15:34.200 --> 15:35.902
Terrific!

15:35.902 --> 15:37.237
I love it!

15:37.237 --> 15:39.372
Okay, Paulie,

15:39.372 --> 15:41.007
confession's good for the soul.

15:41.007 --> 15:42.809
So now's your chance.

15:42.809 --> 15:46.312
We got a couple of scores
to settle, you and me.

15:46.312 --> 15:48.381
Tell me about them.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.450
I'm, I'm sorry, Eddie.

15:50.450 --> 15:53.653
I never should have took your
cut on the Clark Street deal.

15:53.653 --> 15:57.156
Louder!
I can't hear you, Paulie!

15:57.156 --> 15:58.591
...of the Clark Street deal!

15:58.591 --> 16:01.094
An-And that time
I didn't cut you in

16:01.094 --> 16:04.097
on the crack parlor with Garcia,
I was wrong.

16:04.097 --> 16:07.033
An-And when I took over the-the
restaurant protection money

16:07.033 --> 16:10.169
from the North Side,
that-that was yours.

16:10.169 --> 16:11.671
A-And when you
bribed Judge McGuire

16:11.671 --> 16:13.473
for me and I wouldn't
split it...

16:13.473 --> 16:15.241
I should've paid
the whole thing.

16:15.241 --> 16:18.878
And the South Side
prostitution money--

16:18.878 --> 16:21.714
you deserved a cut.

16:21.714 --> 16:23.383
Eh, eh, don't stop!

16:23.383 --> 16:25.418
You're just getting
to the best part!

16:25.418 --> 16:27.754
This is private stuff.

16:27.754 --> 16:29.055
I shouldn't be reading this.

16:29.055 --> 16:30.223
Go on.

16:30.223 --> 16:32.158
Tomorrow you won't
remember a thing.

16:32.158 --> 16:34.093
I'll see to it myself.

16:34.093 --> 16:36.529
(chuckling)

16:36.529 --> 16:37.864
(weak chuckle)

16:37.864 --> 16:39.866
H, I was a pig, Eddie.

16:39.866 --> 16:41.200
I robbed you blind.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.602
And-And that cop
you killed for me,

16:42.602 --> 16:44.203
I never even thanked you.

16:44.203 --> 16:45.872
EDDIE:
An-And when I told everybody

16:45.872 --> 16:48.575
you was a punk in Joliet,
that was a lie.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.577
A-And when I said
you'd never amount to anything,

16:50.577 --> 16:52.312
I was wrong.

16:52.312 --> 16:54.814
A-And Tiffany, she's
better off with you, Eddie.

16:54.814 --> 16:56.816
You was always better than me,

16:56.816 --> 16:59.216
no matter what she thinks now.

17:01.054 --> 17:03.990
And now I control
all your deals.

17:03.990 --> 17:06.993
And all your people
are working for me.

17:06.993 --> 17:09.662
And now I control
your city council

17:09.662 --> 17:13.433
and the trucking,
and the West Side Bank

17:13.433 --> 17:15.635
and the pension funds.

17:15.635 --> 17:18.671
Everything, Paulie.

17:18.671 --> 17:20.840
So what are you gonna
do about it now, huh?

17:20.840 --> 17:25.368
l... I... What?

17:27.180 --> 17:29.148
Do it.

17:36.255 --> 17:38.124
(loud smooching)

17:38.124 --> 17:39.492
That's right, Paulie.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.194
That's exactly what
I want you to do.

17:41.194 --> 17:42.195
(laughs)

17:42.195 --> 17:43.596
(smooching)

17:43.596 --> 17:44.585
(sighs)

17:46.132 --> 17:48.334
I should have done this
years ago, Eddie,

17:48.334 --> 17:50.570
and maybe you would've let me
live a little longer.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.573
Or maybe you wouldn't.

17:53.573 --> 17:56.909
'Cause I deserved what I got
tonight.

17:56.909 --> 17:59.379
In spades.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.314
(laughing)

18:01.314 --> 18:02.749
(whooshing)

18:02.749 --> 18:03.916
Hi, folks.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.151
I'm back.

18:05.151 --> 18:08.054
(laughing)

18:08.054 --> 18:09.522
Hello, Tiffany.

18:09.522 --> 18:10.356
(gasps)

18:10.356 --> 18:13.192
Still hanging around
with this punk?

18:13.192 --> 18:16.496
You are a punk, Eddie,
and you always will be.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.131
PauHe?

18:18.131 --> 18:20.767
Yeah, it's me, little goosey.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.636
Anybody else ever know
I called you that?

18:23.636 --> 18:24.804
It is you!

18:24.804 --> 18:26.639
It's really you.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.307
Hey! What's going on here?

18:28.307 --> 18:29.475
It ain't funny.

18:29.475 --> 18:32.078
I didn't do it.
It's not my fault.

18:32.078 --> 18:34.213
I would've had you killed
ten years ago,

18:34.213 --> 18:37.016
but she begged me not to.

18:37.016 --> 18:40.186
She didn't want to be
left with just one guy.

18:40.186 --> 18:42.455
Go ahead, ask her.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.557
She always needed
more than one guy.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.926
Ain't that right,
little goosey?

18:46.926 --> 18:49.028
TIFFANY:
No! It's a lie!

18:49.028 --> 18:50.363
Wasn't just me, Eddie.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.532
There was other guys, too.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.467
Don't take my word for it.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.203
Ask Nick if she needs
more than one guy.

18:57.203 --> 18:58.438
I didn't do nothin'!

18:58.438 --> 18:59.772
Mayflower Hotel.

18:59.772 --> 19:01.140
August 12.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.909
Room 42.

19:02.909 --> 19:04.077
It was her idea!

19:04.077 --> 19:06.612
Shut up, you moron!

19:06.612 --> 19:08.247
Nicky, put away the gun.

19:08.247 --> 19:09.682
PAULIE:
Watch out, Eddie.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.017
They're gonna kill you.
(guffawing)

19:11.017 --> 19:12.518
Eddie, it's not true!

19:12.518 --> 19:14.721
(Paulie laughing, gunfire)

19:14.721 --> 19:18.391
(laughter, gunfire continue)

19:18.391 --> 19:19.859
(laughing)

19:19.859 --> 19:20.757
(laughter stops)

19:39.979 --> 19:42.014
You stupid broad.

19:42.014 --> 19:45.245
I told you not to cross me.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.947
Hey, puppet man.

19:50.389 --> 19:52.525
You had me going there
for a minute.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.618
How did you do that?

19:56.629 --> 19:58.564
I didn't do anything.

19:58.564 --> 20:00.566
Come on, the Lagretti
brothers set me up.

20:00.566 --> 20:02.568
Nicky told 'em
everything I was gonna do.

20:02.568 --> 20:04.337
-But they got to you first.
-No!

20:04.337 --> 20:05.505
-I swear!
-(Eddie laughs)

20:05.505 --> 20:07.240
Look out behind you.

20:07.240 --> 20:09.008
You ain't gonna fool me
with that twice. (laughs)

20:09.008 --> 20:10.999
(gagging)

20:17.116 --> 20:18.117
(squish, crack)

20:18.117 --> 20:20.119
(Eddie screaming)

20:20.119 --> 20:23.111
(sustained screaming)

20:27.093 --> 20:29.084
(screaming fades)

20:38.905 --> 20:40.566
It's all right.

20:41.574 --> 20:44.277
It's all over now.

20:44.277 --> 20:46.245
We're going home.

20:58.791 --> 21:01.783
J‘J‘

21:19.946 --> 21:23.749
NARRATOR:
The dark side is always there.

21:23.749 --> 21:26.285
Waiting for us to enter.

21:26.285 --> 21:29.922
Waiting to enter us.

21:29.922 --> 21:36.521
Until next time, try
to enjoy the daylight.
