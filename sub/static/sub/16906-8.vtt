08:57.687 --> 08:59.688
[Whispering] She can hear us.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.395
Well, this is certainly high drama.

09:06.429 --> 09:09.648
These are the clothes
that I want to be buried in.

09:09.699 --> 09:11.283
And make sure I'm holding this.

09:11.317 --> 09:14.870
Glue this pin to the inside
of the coffin lid.

09:14.904 --> 09:16.788
For grave robbers.

09:16.823 --> 09:18.624
For grave robbers?
I remember the first time

09:18.658 --> 09:20.542
you ever threatened me with your death.

09:20.576 --> 09:21.856
You should be more appreciative.

09:21.857 --> 09:23.412
I went down to a pack a day for you.

09:23.446 --> 09:24.806
One day, you're gonna turn around,

09:24.807 --> 09:26.114
and I'll be dead like that.

09:26.132 --> 09:27.966
All right. You can knock it
off now, mother.

09:28.001 --> 09:30.135
I'm home.
What happened to your eye?

09:30.169 --> 09:34.139
- Did you really fall?
- I was watching TV,

09:34.173 --> 09:38.126
and they started interviewing
an Asian Santa claus,

09:38.144 --> 09:40.795
- and my arm went numb.
- And you called me?

09:40.813 --> 09:42.814
Mother, call an ambulance.

09:42.849 --> 09:45.484
My father did not kill
dozens of Germans

09:45.518 --> 09:48.820
so that his daughter
could die in a van.

09:48.855 --> 09:50.939
But he wasn't even in the war.

09:50.973 --> 09:52.357
Go about your day, Jack.

09:52.408 --> 09:55.777
Just leave the door open
and let the elements take me.

09:55.811 --> 09:56.971
You're going to the hospital,

09:56.972 --> 09:58.812
and I don't care
how I have to get you there.

09:58.813 --> 10:01.199
Well, I'm not going in an ambulance.

10:01.250 --> 10:04.586
I'll take
a horse-drawn carriage.

10:04.620 --> 10:06.538
Those carriages
are rolling torture wagons

10:06.589 --> 10:08.957
for nature's most dignified creature.

10:08.991 --> 10:11.259
The horse is one of only three
appropriate subjects

10:11.294 --> 10:14.596
for a painting,
along with ships with sails

10:14.630 --> 10:18.183
and men holding up swords while
staring off into the distance.

10:18.217 --> 10:20.102
Sure, let's argue about horses now.

10:20.136 --> 10:22.003
Bring down my things.

10:22.021 --> 10:25.774
I'm going out of this world
exactly the way I came into it,

10:25.808 --> 10:28.176
wearing a hat.

10:28.194 --> 10:31.863
[Elevator door dings]

10:31.898 --> 10:34.616
There you are, K through 12.

10:34.650 --> 10:36.017
Are you the same guy as before?

10:36.035 --> 10:38.203
Or does that sun-bleached turd
have a twin brother?

10:38.237 --> 10:39.621
Same guy, ma'am.

10:39.655 --> 10:42.491
- Oh.
- Uh-oh.

10:42.525 --> 10:44.326
Looks like we're stuck in a elevator.

10:44.360 --> 10:46.194
I guess we'll have to remember stuff

10:46.212 --> 10:49.030
and learn from each other,
just like on TV.

10:49.048 --> 10:50.966
Wait, you did this on purpose?

10:51.000 --> 10:52.640
Are you sure
you know what you're doing?

10:52.641 --> 10:54.469
Apex technical school
puts students first.

10:54.504 --> 10:56.871
And the perfect time to enroll is now.

10:56.889 --> 10:59.541
Wait, we're stuck?
Get us down.

10:59.559 --> 11:01.543
I don't have my flask.

11:01.561 --> 11:03.729
I'm freaking out.
This was a bad idea.

11:03.763 --> 11:05.514
Is this alcohol-based?

11:05.548 --> 11:09.317
Why are you doing this to me, Jacob?

11:09.352 --> 11:11.153
[Shouting]

11:11.187 --> 11:14.322
So our next honoree Liz Lemon
is the head writer

11:14.357 --> 11:16.358
of <i>TGS with Tracy Jordan,</i>

11:16.392 --> 11:19.077
and I am told
she got married yesterday,

11:19.112 --> 11:20.445
just like Gary and that bitch

11:20.496 --> 11:24.065
who was selling us our dream house.

11:24.083 --> 11:26.701
So let's take a look at Liz's work.

11:29.405 --> 11:31.590
Hang on.
This is being weird.

11:31.624 --> 11:33.704
- Blow on the disk.
- Is it on the right component?

11:33.705 --> 11:35.761
Try unplugging it
and plugging it back in.

11:35.795 --> 11:38.079
Just open the disk part and blow on it.

11:41.250 --> 11:42.434
Looking for this?

11:42.468 --> 11:46.354
You ruined my wedding.
It's payback time.

11:46.389 --> 11:47.939
Jenna, what I did was an accident,

11:47.974 --> 11:49.975
but you're trying to sabotage me

11:50.026 --> 11:51.943
just because I'm getting an award?

11:51.978 --> 11:53.178
You know you don't deserve it.

11:53.179 --> 11:54.262
Without me, you'd still be

11:54.280 --> 11:55.730
behind that light board in Chicago,

11:55.764 --> 11:57.765
turning bags of
sour patch kids inside out

11:57.784 --> 12:00.152
to lick them clean.
I got my money's worth.

12:00.203 --> 12:01.703
And without me you'd still be doing

12:01.737 --> 12:03.955
local commercials
for store-brand douches.

12:03.990 --> 12:06.491
Well, joke's on you, because
that wasn't a commercial.

12:06.542 --> 12:08.210
I don't know what that was.

12:08.244 --> 12:10.364
I swear to God, you are
the most selfish human being

12:10.365 --> 12:11.830
- on the planet.
- Thank you.

12:11.881 --> 12:13.832
Visit my website
for extras and ringtones.

12:13.866 --> 12:16.484
Only because I've let you be.
It stops tonight.

12:16.502 --> 12:18.453
You can't stop me
from getting on that stage.

12:18.487 --> 12:19.871
Are you sure?

12:19.922 --> 12:22.591
'Cause guess what
this lighting board nerd did?

12:22.625 --> 12:24.993
So what can I do
for a fellow lightsmith?

12:25.011 --> 12:29.881
I want you to come up 20%
on 16, 32, and 70.

12:29.932 --> 12:31.633
- No, but that would...
- Just do it!

12:31.667 --> 12:35.804
Well, this stage is now lit
for grocery store milk aisle.

12:35.838 --> 12:37.689
[Gasps] I can't get up there.

12:37.723 --> 12:39.024
I'll look...
Horrible.

12:39.058 --> 12:40.675
Yeah.
Oh, no.

12:40.693 --> 12:44.813
Did I ruin your wedding again?

12:44.847 --> 12:48.700
Also you need to tell your Aunt Mary,

12:48.734 --> 12:51.203
when she was two, there was an accident

12:51.237 --> 12:52.687
with a hot comb.

12:52.705 --> 12:54.623
Well, she used to be a boy.

12:54.657 --> 12:55.824
Stop talking, mother.

12:55.858 --> 12:57.859
Save your strength
for yelling at doctors.

12:57.877 --> 13:00.528
There's a couple of other
things I want you to know, Jack.

13:00.546 --> 13:04.466
And I don't want you to
interrupt me until I'm done.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.835
All I want is for you to be happy.

13:06.869 --> 13:09.504
- Happy?
- Yes.

13:09.538 --> 13:12.040
Since when did you ever care
about happiness?

13:12.058 --> 13:14.209
Don't talk to me like that, Jack.

13:14.227 --> 13:17.012
I breast-fed you
for nine years!

13:17.046 --> 13:19.648
Those are terrible last words.

13:19.682 --> 13:21.816
The closest you ever get to happiness

13:21.851 --> 13:23.602
is when you're criticizing something,

13:23.653 --> 13:25.737
preferably something I've done.

13:25.771 --> 13:27.355
Jack, stop talking.

13:27.389 --> 13:31.059
I am not going to be around forever.

13:31.077 --> 13:33.528
- Oh, here it comes.
- One of these days,

13:33.562 --> 13:35.580
you're gonna turn around, Jack,

13:35.615 --> 13:38.700
and I'm gonna be gone...
Just like that.

13:38.734 --> 13:40.252
When this little performance is over,

13:40.286 --> 13:43.755
I may put you in a home just like that.

13:46.575 --> 13:49.577

13:56.903 --> 13:58.553

of the universe, Jenna.

14:29.335 --> 14:30.451
Can it, Bonnie.

14:30.469 --> 14:32.120
I can't believe
you're doing this to me.

14:32.138 --> 14:35.223
And Paul. He's been
in that steamer trunk for hours.

14:35.258 --> 14:39.761

of oxygen is making me orgasm.

Why can't you ever be happy
for me, ever?

14:43.132 --> 14:45.300
I got married, and you don't care.

14:45.318 --> 14:46.601
Why should she?

14:46.635 --> 14:48.515
We shouldn't be defining
ourselves by our men.

14:48.516 --> 14:49.876
Oh, so in order to be independent,

14:49.877 --> 14:51.639
we have to be asexual?

14:51.657 --> 14:53.141
You would know, Judy.

14:53.159 --> 14:55.744
God, I miss Gary so much!

15:21.891 --> 15:23.045
Jack, I got your text,

15:23.046 --> 15:25.006
but I think there was
some autocorrect problems.

15:25.041 --> 15:26.508
Colleen had a fart attack?

15:26.542 --> 15:27.992
She died, Liz.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.594
Oh, my God.

15:29.628 --> 15:33.181
She had a heart attack
and died on the way here.

15:33.215 --> 15:36.468
Oh, Jack, I am so sorry.

15:36.502 --> 15:38.386
Before she died, Colleen told me

15:38.421 --> 15:40.638
- she just wants me to be happy.
- Really?

15:40.672 --> 15:42.072
'Cause that doesn't sound like her,

15:42.108 --> 15:44.675

strange things at the end.

You know, my grandmother said,
"Liz, stop playing

15:46.695 --> 15:48.015

around my elbow."

15:48.016 --> 15:49.256
"I just want you
to be happy."

15:49.257 --> 15:51.216
You know who you say that to?
A loser.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.318
Someone who can't hope
for anything more in life

15:53.352 --> 15:55.820
than just being happy.

15:55.855 --> 15:58.640
You say that to someone
who has disappointed you.

15:58.674 --> 16:01.409
- Jack.
- No. It's perfect.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.194
She's a genius.

16:03.212 --> 16:05.696
One last twist of the knife.

Well, thank you for coming,
Lemon, but I better get going.

16:08.918 --> 16:10.335
The funeral is tomorrow.

16:10.369 --> 16:11.469
Colleen wanted to be buried

16:11.477 --> 16:13.037
before the rest of the family found out

16:13.055 --> 16:15.706
and sold her body to a haunted house.

16:15.725 --> 16:18.476
And, of course, I get to
eulogize Colleen at the service.

16:18.511 --> 16:20.512
One more chance to disappoint her

fighting with your best friend.

16:37.696 --> 16:40.698
I know.
Can I be real with you, Liz?

16:40.732 --> 16:43.234
All these years I've always been
able to look at you

16:43.252 --> 16:45.086
and feel better about myself.

16:45.121 --> 16:46.571
- Sure.
- Don't interrupt.

16:46.589 --> 16:48.949
The pill that lets me feel
emotion is gonna wear off soon.

that I think about during sex.

17:00.419 --> 17:01.719
Awwugh.

a little upside-down,

17:05.357 --> 17:07.025
And I'm sorry
you weren't at my wedding.

17:07.059 --> 17:08.444
But it made me realize

17:08.444 --> 17:10.444
that this whole surprise wedding
thing is stupid.

17:10.479 --> 17:11.945
When I get married, I want

17:11.981 --> 17:13.565
everyone I care about to be there.

Wow, Jenna,

haven't talked like this...

17:32.802 --> 17:34.285
Mr. Jordan, stop.

17:34.303 --> 17:37.338
I don't want my life
to be like TV anymore.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.891
Because no one learns
anything in elevators,

17:39.925 --> 17:42.260
and we almost killed
Florence Henderson.

17:42.294 --> 17:44.512
Yes. Almost.

17:44.563 --> 17:46.731
I don't want my life to be like TV,

17:46.765 --> 17:49.984
because my life is way better.

17:50.019 --> 17:51.436
Where else but real life

17:51.470 --> 17:53.471
would a millionaire movie star

17:53.489 --> 17:55.806
care so much about a hillbilly janitor

17:55.825 --> 17:57.808
that he would spend two days

17:57.827 --> 17:59.110
trying to cheer him up?

17:59.144 --> 18:00.862
You can't do that on television.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.364
Because, if you did,
no one would watch.

18:03.415 --> 18:04.949
Thank you, Mr. Jordan.

18:04.983 --> 18:07.869
Thank you for my wonderful life.

18:10.956 --> 18:13.324

to come back.

You weren't supposed
to have any lines, Kwon Lee.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.512
Now I have to pay you.

18:19.765 --> 18:22.283
Friends, last night when I sat down

18:22.318 --> 18:25.854
