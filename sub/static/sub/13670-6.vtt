WEBVTT

01:38.280 --> 01:39.840
&lt; Stop screaming at me.

01:39.840 --> 01:42.760
&lt; I'm aware you're in the
middle of a bridge tournament.

01:42.760 --> 01:46.280
I'm calling about
Mrs Hardy. Well, how does

01:46.280 --> 01:48.920
"dead" sound to you? Mm-hm.

01:48.920 --> 01:51.240
Aren't we supposed to be
meeting for rounds?

01:51.240 --> 01:53.640
Who do I look like, Karnack?

01:53.640 --> 01:56.920
Yeah.

01:56.920 --> 01:59.640
Uh-huh. &gt;

01:59.640 --> 02:03.120
Well, perhaps you should
talk to the grieving family!

02:03.120 --> 02:05.360
Or bid three no trump.

02:05.360 --> 02:09.360
Lucy, you were very hard on Consuela
Lopez at the day-shift meeting.

02:09.919 --> 02:11.760
Do you have a complaint?

02:11.760 --> 02:15.760
Stick it the suggestion box.

02:17.280 --> 02:20.480
Have I lost weight
or have I lost weight, huh?

02:20.480 --> 02:21.840
Big weigh-in's coming up?

02:21.840 --> 02:24.440
Between Luther's
exercise and Ehrlich's diet,

02:24.440 --> 02:26.240
I look better, I feel better.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.960
Who's leading rounds for Westphall?

02:27.960 --> 02:29.000
Craig.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.200
Lucky for me I'm doing
OBGYN rotation.

02:31.200 --> 02:32.640
Lucky Turner had her shots.

02:32.640 --> 02:34.720
I hear you're euphemising
her without italics.

02:34.720 --> 02:37.480
I hear you're euphemising
her without italics.
Craig's been in the worst
mood ever lately, huh?

02:37.480 --> 02:40.320
You'd be if someone walked
   off with your granddaughter?

02:40.320 --> 02:43.520
Ooh, one of my patients
gave me these tickets.

02:43.520 --> 02:44.440
Rod Stewart?

02:44.440 --> 02:45.800
Peter Eisler up in Gastro.

02:45.800 --> 02:46.920
Peter Eisler up in Gastro.
What are they for?

02:46.920 --> 02:48.920
To hear Colonel
     Charles Cochrane speak.

02:48.920 --> 02:51.400
To hear Colonel
     Charles Cochrane speak.
Wow! Who's Colonel
        Charles Cochrane?

02:51.400 --> 02:55.280
The astronaut! My cousin Peewee
and I can't go because we're body

02:55.280 --> 02:57.560
buddies in the gym tonight.

02:57.560 --> 02:58.240
Want 'em?

02:58.240 --> 02:59.640
Want 'em?
Uh, pass.

02:59.640 --> 03:00.320
Want 'em?

03:00.320 --> 03:02.880
Want 'em?
Uh, no, astronauts
got boring after Apollo.

03:02.880 --> 03:05.960
Nobody could top Alan Sheppard.
What are we talking about?

03:05.960 --> 03:09.760
A lecture to hear Colonel
Charles Cochrane speak. Want 'em?

03:09.760 --> 03:12.160
When I want a lecture,
I go to Dr Craig.

03:12.160 --> 03:14.560
          Heel, Ehrlich.

03:14.560 --> 03:16.920
Next time she shaves you,
have her change the blade.

03:16.920 --> 03:18.680
Next time she shaves you,
have her change the blade.
Forget it. I'm going electric.

03:18.680 --> 03:20.440
Plastics! Call me.

03:20.440 --> 03:22.120
&lt; Baby patrol! Move out.

03:22.120 --> 03:24.040
Concentrate on her
patients, not her pants.

03:24.040 --> 03:25.680
Concentrate on her
patients, not her pants.
          See you later.

03:25.680 --> 03:28.840
First case, Dr Morrison.
Morrison?

03:28.840 --> 03:30.720
He's late again, sir.

03:30.720 --> 03:34.080
Well, when he does decide to join us,
I'm sure we'll be subjected

03:34.080 --> 03:38.040
to a litany of excuses that
dates back to his first day
in kindergarten,

03:38.040 --> 03:41.160
which, according to his background,
wasn't that long ago.

03:41.160 --> 03:43.800
All right, Axelrod, your first case.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.680
Uh, Worzoger, Harriet.

03:45.680 --> 03:49.320
Where the hell have you been?
Rounds start on time, mister.

03:49.320 --> 03:51.480
I was...
But I thought we...

03:51.480 --> 03:52.680
I went to...

03:52.680 --> 03:56.680
           Oh, shut up!

03:57.760 --> 04:01.760
Tommy and I picked these
marigolds before school.

04:02.400 --> 04:03.440
Here's your mail.

04:03.440 --> 04:04.560
Thank you.

04:04.560 --> 04:07.600
Your daughter called.
She's coming tomorrow.

04:07.600 --> 04:08.920
Is she bringing Rick?

04:08.920 --> 04:09.960
Nope.

04:09.960 --> 04:13.160
Are you upset because she
went out west with Horace Greenbay?

04:13.160 --> 04:15.120
I am. It's not
                that she lied to me,

04:15.120 --> 04:16.839
it's just she
               left out the details.

04:16.839 --> 04:20.120
Dishonesty through omission -
a disease among young women.

04:20.120 --> 04:22.120
Maureen had a chronic case.

04:22.120 --> 04:24.040
What do you mean?

04:24.040 --> 04:27.240
Oh, I don't blame you for not
eating. Condemned prisoners

04:27.240 --> 04:29.520
get better slop.
From now on, I'm catering.

04:29.520 --> 04:30.640
Keep your voice down.

04:30.640 --> 04:33.080
If the dieticians hear you,
         I'll get letters.

04:33.080 --> 04:34.200
I own a restaurant.

04:34.200 --> 04:37.240
I have a personal aversion
 to seeing eggs treated that way.

04:37.240 --> 04:38.680
Those aren't eggs.

04:38.680 --> 04:41.000
Excuse us!

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
I will stop back later with
a little low cuisine. Feel better.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.800
Who's she?

04:46.800 --> 04:48.080
His sister-in-law.

04:48.080 --> 04:51.080
All you've done for the last
two weeks is come in with these

04:51.080 --> 04:53.880
residents to poke at me.
  I'm not a geek in a sideshow.

04:53.880 --> 04:56.000
Don't be so selfish.
When do these slugs

04:56.000 --> 04:59.680
get to eyeball a tropical disease
in the middle of Boston Harbour?

04:59.680 --> 05:01.880
      Well, present the case.

05:01.880 --> 05:04.760
Patient's name is Westphall, Donald.

05:04.760 --> 05:06.560
White male, 55.

05:06.560 --> 05:09.360
         We know all that!

05:09.360 --> 05:13.360
Admitted two weeks ago after
syncopal episode with high fever.

05:13.640 --> 05:17.400
Physical exam was remarkable
   for palpable spleen.

05:17.400 --> 05:21.400
Peripheral blood smear showed
presence of falciparum malaria.

05:21.600 --> 05:25.600
Your crit's up. We could use a little
more improvement in renal function.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.040
Palpate the spleen for assessment.

05:28.040 --> 05:31.080
Well, I've never palpated
another doctor before.

05:31.080 --> 05:35.080
   What's the difference? Do it!

05:35.200 --> 05:38.680
Be gentle.

05:38.680 --> 05:40.000
Axelrod?

05:40.000 --> 05:40.440
Mm?

05:40.440 --> 05:42.760
Mm?
Under the clothes.

05:42.760 --> 05:46.200
So I guess you won't be
going back to the Cape soon!

05:46.200 --> 05:48.160
               I'm selling the house.

05:48.160 --> 05:52.160
After what happened to you,
I'd do the same thing.

05:54.840 --> 05:58.080
      Hello there, Mr Boyden.

05:58.080 --> 06:00.360
     Your evaluation, please.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.160
My sails are off.

06:02.160 --> 06:04.600
Might as well look at
            the doorknob growing out

06:04.600 --> 06:06.440
of my wrist instead of the samples.

06:06.440 --> 06:09.880
It appears to be a small ganglion
cyst on the wrist. A Bible node.

06:09.880 --> 06:10.960
Course of treatment?

06:10.960 --> 06:13.440
Doctors used to whack these
babies with a book,

06:13.440 --> 06:16.480
a Bible being the tool of choice.
I'd recommend local excision.

06:16.480 --> 06:17.400
Schedule surgery for Thursday.

06:17.400 --> 06:20.120
Schedule surgery for Thursday.
Hey, Caldwell, while we're there,

06:20.120 --> 06:22.280
do something about
     the shades over my eyes.

06:22.280 --> 06:24.480
Let's take care
of the cyst first, huh?

06:24.480 --> 06:26.360
Can you see through
that bandage?

06:26.360 --> 06:28.160
  This'll be off after tomorrow.

06:28.160 --> 06:30.040
If my vision
is in any way blurred,

06:30.040 --> 06:31.960
I'll have another
surgeon step in.

06:31.960 --> 06:33.400
What did happen to your face?

06:33.400 --> 06:37.400
Mailman bit me.

06:38.160 --> 06:39.480
Are you interested

06:39.480 --> 06:42.240
in two free tickets to hear
Chuck Cochrane speak tonight?

06:42.240 --> 06:42.680
The astronaut?

06:42.680 --> 06:43.800
The astronaut?
You've heard of him?

06:43.800 --> 06:46.960
He repaired the IPC satellite
on the last Shuttle mission.

06:46.960 --> 06:49.520
Hey, great!
Here. I was just gonna toss 'em.

06:49.520 --> 06:52.520
I've followed every mission
since the Mercury Project.

06:52.520 --> 06:54.440
I have models of all the rockets.

06:54.440 --> 06:55.880
I wanted to be an astronaut.

06:55.880 --> 06:56.320
You?!

06:56.320 --> 06:57.480
You?!
Yeah.

06:57.480 --> 07:01.400
What better job for a space cadet?

07:01.400 --> 07:03.160
            Will you jokers hurry up?

07:03.160 --> 07:04.920
     We're not on a Sierra Club hike.

07:04.920 --> 07:07.200
                Dr Fiscus, next case.

07:07.200 --> 07:10.760
Pru Dowler,
26, female, mentally retarded,

07:10.760 --> 07:14.480
held for observation after blunt
trauma to the abdomen yesterday

07:14.480 --> 07:17.760
when a bus load of disabled people
was hit by a drunk driver.

07:17.760 --> 07:21.760
Uh, vitals all stable,
hypertensive, BP's 156/94.

07:28.520 --> 07:29.760
Hello, Miss Dowler.

07:29.760 --> 07:31.640
My name's Pru.  Hi.

07:31.640 --> 07:34.040
Are you feeling better today?

07:34.040 --> 07:35.040
Uh-huh.

07:35.040 --> 07:36.560
Uh-huh.
Let me take a look at you.

07:36.560 --> 07:40.560
Just lie back.

07:43.240 --> 07:44.800
          Pretty picture.

07:44.800 --> 07:46.640
Wanna play?

07:46.640 --> 07:47.440
           Who are you?

07:47.440 --> 07:49.520
           Who are you?
Buddy.

07:49.520 --> 07:51.920
One of the other disabled
people from the crash.

07:51.920 --> 07:55.920
Can't you see we're
performing an examination here?

07:55.960 --> 07:59.840
Oh.

07:59.840 --> 08:00.960
I had a cat.

08:00.960 --> 08:03.240
Does she have a history
of hypertension?

08:03.240 --> 08:06.200
She's now on three
anti-hypertensives with control.

08:06.200 --> 08:07.640
Her name was Muffy.

08:07.640 --> 08:11.000
Mm-hm.
OK. So long, Pru.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.160
Internal medicine -
all talk, no action.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.400
Can I kiss you goodbye?

08:15.400 --> 08:19.400
Uh, Fiscus, take care
of that, will you?

08:25.160 --> 08:25.720
&lt; Bye.

08:25.720 --> 08:28.000
&lt; Bye.
Bye.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.440
I can't believe it, a rotation
I've been dreading all these months

08:31.440 --> 08:33.039
     has turned into a dream.

08:33.039 --> 08:34.159
Don't get too happy.

08:34.159 --> 08:35.919
Most of the time
I'll be on vacation.

08:35.919 --> 08:37.120
Most of the time
I'll be on vacation.
                      Well, delay it.

08:37.120 --> 08:38.520
I haven't had time off

08:38.520 --> 08:41.039
since the ex and I
went on our honeymoon.

08:41.039 --> 08:44.400
It's a week of fishing
in the Gulf of Mexico.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.800
I don't like being back
here any more than you do.

08:46.800 --> 08:50.320
Terri, the tour's here.

08:50.320 --> 08:53.240
Welcome to the foetus factory.

08:53.240 --> 08:54.840
Here you go, Ken.

08:54.840 --> 08:58.760
By this point, the jar and I
should announce our engagement!

08:58.760 --> 09:02.760
Dr Chandler, would you fill
everyone in on the case?

09:02.960 --> 09:06.240
Yes, um, Valere, Terri,
33-year-old white female,

09:06.240 --> 09:08.960
blocked Fallopian tubes
causing infertility.

09:08.960 --> 09:12.960
She was placed on HMG in preparation
for in-vitro fertilisation.

09:13.560 --> 09:16.800
Saw egg follicles in ultrasound
of stimulated ovulation prior

09:16.800 --> 09:18.600
     to ovum harvest tomorrow.

09:18.600 --> 09:22.240
It's harvest time! The leaves
are turning, and so's my stomach.

09:22.240 --> 09:26.240
If you'll excuse me, duty calls.

09:27.520 --> 09:30.280
What happened to the tall,
gawky resident?

09:30.280 --> 09:34.280
Dr Morrison.
He finished his rotation. &gt;

09:34.720 --> 09:35.880
          Chest is clear.

09:35.880 --> 09:37.880
We've been guinea
pigs for that long?

09:37.880 --> 09:41.320
Ken and I must be underwriting
St Eligius' budget by now.

09:41.320 --> 09:44.040
But this time I've got
    a feeling it's gonna work.

09:44.040 --> 09:45.760
                   Heart sounds fine.

09:45.760 --> 09:48.800
Terri, it's still a crap shoot.

09:48.800 --> 09:49.920
Don't get your hopes
       up too high yet.

09:49.920 --> 09:52.080
Don't get your hopes
       up too high yet.
Pay attention here, class.

09:52.080 --> 09:55.680
This is the "there are lots
of variables, no guarantees"
   part.

09:55.680 --> 09:59.120
What Dr Turner is saying
is that in-vitro fertilisation

09:59.120 --> 10:00.720
is in the experimental stage.

10:00.720 --> 10:03.440
Dr Chandler,
I have done this procedure.

10:03.440 --> 10:07.440
I think I can speak for myself.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.880
Are you OK?

10:15.880 --> 10:17.880
Weightlessness.

10:17.880 --> 10:20.040
Zero G.

10:20.040 --> 10:22.920
A misnomer technically,
where even in outer space

10:22.920 --> 10:25.040
a hint of gravity tugs at you.

10:25.040 --> 10:28.440
Houston control had to
   coax me back to the shuttle

10:28.440 --> 10:29.800
during my last spacewalk.

10:29.800 --> 10:33.760
It seems I was having too much
fun at the taxpayers' expense.

10:33.760 --> 10:37.760
When I left Orbiter to repair
the satellite, I stepped into

10:38.720 --> 10:40.040
a different world.

10:40.040 --> 10:43.560
The Earth below me, the stars.

10:43.560 --> 10:47.560
Outside the scope of human concerns.

10:49.840 --> 10:53.840
No longer just an earthling,
but a tiny planet.

10:59.360 --> 11:03.360
I look forward to my scheduled
walk during the mission next month.

11:05.560 --> 11:08.720
I'm sorry, we'd better
cut it right here.

11:08.720 --> 11:10.480
I spoke longer than I intended,

11:10.480 --> 11:14.480
and my wife and I have
  to return to Houston tonight.

11:14.960 --> 11:17.760
I'm proud to serve America
on the frontier of space.

11:17.760 --> 11:21.720
Thank you very much.

11:21.720 --> 11:25.720
     Let's meet an astronaut.

11:36.240 --> 11:40.240
Chuck!

11:42.240 --> 11:43.880
I'm a doctor.
What happened?

11:43.880 --> 11:47.880
I can't move my legs.

12:04.360 --> 12:06.640
OK, pupils equal and reactive.

12:06.640 --> 12:08.280
I want a full blood work up. &gt;

12:08.280 --> 12:10.200
X-ray of both
                  motor extremities.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.920
When did you first notice
the weakness in your legs?

12:12.920 --> 12:14.560
          A few days ago.

12:14.560 --> 12:17.760
There was a tingling sensation,
and everything felt heavy.

12:17.760 --> 12:20.120
I figured I was tired.
But it kept getting worse.

12:20.120 --> 12:21.680
Have you been ill recently?

12:21.680 --> 12:24.120
He had a cold a few weeks ago.
A bad one.

12:24.120 --> 12:25.800
       Everybody has colds.

12:25.800 --> 12:27.440
I've passed every
physical since

12:27.440 --> 12:30.000
I got out of the Academy,
without a hitch.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.120
          What is wrong?

12:31.120 --> 12:33.400
We'll know more after the tests.

12:33.400 --> 12:35.400
OK, what I want you to do now

12:35.400 --> 12:37.560
is squeeze my fingers
      as hard as you can.

12:37.560 --> 12:39.440
OK.

12:39.440 --> 12:42.560
Upper extremities, A-OK.

12:42.560 --> 12:46.560
Now try and lift your legs.

12:50.400 --> 12:53.080
OK, I want to do an LP.
Send the blood for a chem panel

12:53.080 --> 12:55.840
and viral titres.
Also have a respiratory therapist

12:55.840 --> 12:57.520
come down to measure capacity.

12:57.520 --> 12:58.720
Was it a stroke?

12:58.720 --> 13:01.080
A full stroke usually affects
  one side of the body.

13:01.080 --> 13:03.640
We're going to admit you,
    Colonel.

13:03.640 --> 13:05.560
I'll put in a menu request.

13:05.560 --> 13:09.480
Brian.
Do you want me to call NASA?

13:09.480 --> 13:11.600
    No! You know how they are.

13:11.600 --> 13:14.680
They'll ground you for a hangnail.

13:14.680 --> 13:15.960
       So it'll get better?

13:15.960 --> 13:17.840
There's no reason
       to believe it won't.

13:17.840 --> 13:21.840
You see.
Nothing to worry about.

13:25.040 --> 13:29.040
Elliott won't come out.
You talk to him.

13:29.200 --> 13:32.160
Hey!
We're talking heatstroke, pal.

13:32.160 --> 13:33.840
        You're vasodilated.

13:33.840 --> 13:37.840
Raise your core temperature high
enough to squash your brains.

13:38.840 --> 13:42.840
             Come on.

13:45.880 --> 13:48.320
I feel great.

13:48.320 --> 13:50.160
                           All right!

13:50.160 --> 13:53.760
You know, I never would have been
able to stick to this programme

13:53.760 --> 13:55.360
if it wasn't for you guys.

13:55.360 --> 13:57.720
We appreciate a challenge.

13:57.720 --> 14:00.040
So I get see Marcy again.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.080
Haven't seen her
for one whole month.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.800
        What kind of diet was she on?

14:03.800 --> 14:06.040
High protein.

14:06.040 --> 14:07.280
You know,

14:07.280 --> 14:11.280
my high school gym class voted
me most likely to blot out the sun.

14:12.360 --> 14:14.680
But this time,

14:14.680 --> 14:18.680
I really tried,
  I mean I really had willpower!

14:19.400 --> 14:20.560
                 The moment of truth.

14:20.560 --> 14:24.560
Oh, boy.

14:30.240 --> 14:33.040
Well?

14:33.040 --> 14:34.440
                     Congratulations.

14:34.440 --> 14:34.960
What is it?

14:34.960 --> 14:36.280
What is it?
He gained 3½ pounds.

14:36.280 --> 14:37.640
What?

14:37.640 --> 14:38.920
   You call yourself a trainer?

14:38.920 --> 14:40.920
Wait a minute!
If you hadn't starved

14:40.920 --> 14:44.360
the  guy on rabbit food, he wouldn't
have snacked between meals.

14:44.360 --> 14:47.400
The Berkeley diet
has been endorsed by everyone,

14:47.400 --> 14:50.680
from physicians, to the tantric
master Hernando Vargas.

14:50.680 --> 14:53.800
Well, I had him doing push ups,
sit ups, chin ups.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.520
         You had him doing throw ups.

14:55.520 --> 14:59.280
You don't realise how important
bulimia is. Just stick to surgery.

14:59.280 --> 15:01.000
          You stick to pushing a mop.

15:01.000 --> 15:01.800
Quack!

15:01.800 --> 15:03.400
Quack!
          Now, squawk like a chicken.

15:03.400 --> 15:07.400
Shut up, will you!
This is nobody's fault but my own.

15:10.520 --> 15:14.520
KNOCK AT THE DOOR

15:16.800 --> 15:18.760
If you'd married Joan Halloran,
that wouldn't have happened.

15:18.760 --> 15:21.320
If you'd married Joan Halloran,
that wouldn't have happened.
        Oh, spare me, Mark.

15:21.320 --> 15:23.480
      What's this all about?

15:23.480 --> 15:27.440
I've just received a report from
 the Residency Review Committee.

15:27.440 --> 15:29.200
They are hysterical because

15:29.200 --> 15:32.160
of the decline in elective surgeries
in both your departments.

15:32.160 --> 15:34.160
Electives are down.

15:34.160 --> 15:36.520
Everyone in plastics
sees plenty of action.

15:36.520 --> 15:39.560
This month, three
microsurgeries for limb reattachment.

15:39.560 --> 15:41.560
&lt; Which is why
the committee is up in arms.

15:41.560 --> 15:44.760
The residents aren't getting
   a full range of experience

15:44.760 --> 15:46.240
in cosmetic procedures.

15:46.240 --> 15:49.240
What about Andrea Fordham?
Probably the most extensive

15:49.240 --> 15:51.800
reconstruction work ever done
to a patient.

15:51.800 --> 15:54.080
Yesterday's news, Bob.

15:54.080 --> 15:57.160
I mean, let's face it,
this is a training hospital.

15:57.160 --> 16:00.720
If the residents aren't handling
a volume of the basics, they are not

16:00.720 --> 16:03.840
getting the proper training.
Same thing goes for OBGYM.

16:03.840 --> 16:06.400
So what do I do?
Let emergency C-sections

16:06.400 --> 16:08.000
wait in the hall.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.800
I don't know what the answer is.

16:09.800 --> 16:12.520
More referrals, longer
clinic hours, I don't know.

16:12.520 --> 16:15.880
Don't these bozos have anything
better to do than kick up trouble?

16:15.880 --> 16:18.680
This is serious, Bob.
If both of you don't

16:18.680 --> 16:22.680
develop a broader caseload,
your departments won't
   be recertified.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.240
PHONE BUZZES

16:24.240 --> 16:24.760
Yes, who is it?

16:24.760 --> 16:25.920
Yes, who is it?
'Oliver London here!'

16:25.920 --> 16:27.760
Oh, not now!

16:27.760 --> 16:30.400
'First, you hog the
     OR with the good stereo.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.400
'Then cancel at the last minute.'

16:32.400 --> 16:35.400
This is a man who plays
Barry Manilow while he operates.

16:35.400 --> 16:38.280
'I heard that! You know what
your problem is, Craig?

16:38.280 --> 16:41.760
'Napoleon complex.
Small men want to rule the world.'

16:41.760 --> 16:43.360
Oliver.

16:43.360 --> 16:47.360
Listen very carefully
to what I have to say.

16:47.360 --> 16:49.760
I'll live to see that
clown out of this hospital.

16:49.760 --> 16:53.160
And you people, out of my office.

16:53.160 --> 16:57.160
I've got work to do.

16:59.840 --> 17:02.440
I left Duke to treat
burns and trauma.

17:02.440 --> 17:05.839
Where the hell am I going to drum up
facelifts in a city hospital?

17:05.839 --> 17:08.800
You know what I'm going to do?
Put an ad in Yellow Pages.

17:08.800 --> 17:11.200
Free colour television
with every D and C.

17:11.200 --> 17:13.800
Yeah. Lollipops for the kids.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.319
    How about a cup of coffee?

17:15.319 --> 17:17.400
Why not?
Can't wait to go back home

17:17.400 --> 17:19.560
and get up on the
      right side of the bed.

17:19.560 --> 17:21.640
   I heart about your accident.

17:21.640 --> 17:22.319
It wasn't an accident.

17:22.319 --> 17:26.319
It wasn't an accident.
         I heard that too.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.800
Nice doggy.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.720
I have a dog.

17:31.720 --> 17:35.720
Her name's Topper.

17:36.160 --> 17:38.680
Does she shake your hand?

17:38.680 --> 17:40.640
My best friend.

17:40.640 --> 17:44.640
Just had puppies.

17:50.640 --> 17:52.160
She's pretty!

17:52.160 --> 17:56.160
You are more pretty.

17:58.600 --> 17:59.920
My mum is pretty.

17:59.920 --> 18:03.400
You are too.

18:03.400 --> 18:07.400
And, I'd like to kiss you.

18:10.200 --> 18:14.200
I'd like to kiss you too.

18:20.960 --> 18:24.960
That's nice.

18:25.600 --> 18:29.600
Let's kiss again.

18:35.120 --> 18:38.200
What did you do after she sliced you?

18:38.200 --> 18:41.960
I stood there for a few seconds
trying to hold my face together.

18:41.960 --> 18:44.640
And then I punched her lights out.

18:44.640 --> 18:46.200
The cops came to take her away.

18:46.200 --> 18:47.960
She just looked at me and smiled.

18:47.960 --> 18:51.960
I don't understand it.
What the hell did she do it for?

18:52.680 --> 18:54.320
The world's a
screwed up place.

18:54.320 --> 18:56.800
Nothing's going right lately.

18:56.800 --> 18:59.920
Just like this garbage
with the Review Committee.

18:59.920 --> 19:03.920
If I'd been more aggressive my
department wouldn't be in trouble.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.520
It used to be that
     I'd follow my instincts.

19:07.520 --> 19:10.240
But now,
I don't trust them any more.

19:10.240 --> 19:13.960
Pathetic, huh?

19:13.960 --> 19:17.600
Let's just say, mildly depressing.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.120
Well.

19:19.120 --> 19:20.960
I've got a look in on a
patient before I head back to OR.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.240
I've got a look in on a
patient before I head back to OR.
Does this patient
need a hysterectomy?

19:23.240 --> 19:25.840
I doubt it. 29-year-old male.

19:25.840 --> 19:29.840
But I'll ask.

19:32.680 --> 19:36.680
Bobby seems to be taking
his injuries pretty hard.

19:37.120 --> 19:41.120
How would you like
   to go with me on a vacation?

19:42.400 --> 19:46.360
That's direct.
To the point. And not a bad idea.

19:46.360 --> 19:47.440
And where would you like to go?

19:47.440 --> 19:49.440
And where would you like to go?
Does anyone know
how badly he was cut?

19:49.440 --> 19:51.440
The only thing
that's going to take

19:51.440 --> 19:53.440
a long time to heal is Bob's pride.

19:53.440 --> 19:56.400
Now, where would you like to go?
Cancun? Rio?

19:56.400 --> 20:00.040
I want to go somewhere with great
beaches. And even greater food.

20:00.040 --> 20:01.000
St Martin?

20:01.000 --> 20:02.880
St Martin?
      And a sense of history.

20:02.880 --> 20:04.440
Havana during the fifties.

20:04.440 --> 20:06.440
             Exactly.

20:06.440 --> 20:10.440
     See, I'm easy to please!

20:21.800 --> 20:22.840
             Hi, Dad.

20:22.840 --> 20:24.600
Hi, kid.

20:24.600 --> 20:25.280
Good to see.

20:25.280 --> 20:26.800
Oh, good to see you. How do you feel?

20:26.800 --> 20:29.520
Oh, good to see you. How do you feel?
Oh, I'm fine. I just have
to take it easy for a while.

20:29.520 --> 20:29.960
Where are you going?

20:29.960 --> 20:31.000
Where are you going?
Home.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.600
Already? We bought lunch.

20:32.600 --> 20:34.400
 And avocados from the West Coast.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.680
They got ripe in the car, but I
learned how to make great guacamole.

20:37.680 --> 20:39.440
  Rick brought his video camera.

20:39.440 --> 20:41.760
We got some great film
of the national parks.

20:41.760 --> 20:44.000
With editing we could score
extra credits.

20:44.000 --> 20:44.440
Sure thing.

20:44.440 --> 20:46.440
Sure thing.
You don't look well
enough to go home.

20:46.440 --> 20:46.880
I'm fine.

20:46.880 --> 20:49.400
I'm fine.
Why didn't you tell
me you were in the hospital?

20:49.400 --> 20:51.720
Didn't want to spoil your trip.
Did you have a good time?

20:51.720 --> 20:53.080
Didn't want to spoil your trip.
Did you have a good time?
           I missed you.

20:53.080 --> 20:54.600
KNOCK AT THE DOOR

20:54.600 --> 20:58.080
Hate to interrupt a family reunion,
but I came for your urine sample.

20:58.080 --> 20:59.920
Right here.

20:59.920 --> 21:01.200
It looks healthy to me.

21:01.200 --> 21:03.360
Take that to the lab, Ehrlich.

21:03.360 --> 21:04.840
In a flash. &gt;

21:04.840 --> 21:07.040
 I'm here now to take care of you.

21:07.040 --> 21:08.520
I'm glad you're here.

21:08.520 --> 21:11.400
I have to clean some things off
my desk before I go home.

21:11.400 --> 21:15.040
We'll wait.
Do you think your cafeteria can make
a decent cup of hot water?

21:15.040 --> 21:18.840
Actually, I wanted to have
some pictures of the trip developed.

21:18.840 --> 21:20.320
       OK if I use the car?

21:20.320 --> 21:22.520
Yeah, sure. Be back in an hour?

21:22.520 --> 21:23.520
          Yeah. Love you.

21:23.520 --> 21:23.960
Bye-bye.

21:23.960 --> 21:26.960
Bye-bye.
               Bye.

21:26.960 --> 21:29.440
That was some performance.

21:29.440 --> 21:31.240
What do you mean?

21:31.240 --> 21:35.040
The two of you. You really
must be angry with each other.

21:35.040 --> 21:39.040
Because that was so
sweet it made me sick.

21:46.560 --> 21:48.280
Nurse Rosenthal,

21:48.280 --> 21:51.120
I thought you might want to
know that there's a party going

21:51.120 --> 21:52.680
on in Room 3314.

21:52.680 --> 21:54.800
                  What kind of party?

21:54.800 --> 21:57.480
The two handicapped people.
Buddy and...

21:57.480 --> 21:59.920
You know, the girl
named after the tower.

21:59.920 --> 22:00.360
               Pru?

22:00.360 --> 22:01.840
               Pru?
Uh-huh. They uh...

22:01.840 --> 22:05.840
They're involved in, um, er,

22:06.360 --> 22:08.080
in the procreative act.

22:08.080 --> 22:09.600
&lt; SCREAMING

22:09.600 --> 22:13.600
SCREAMING

22:17.400 --> 22:19.840
            I'm scared.

22:19.840 --> 22:23.840
Because of the blood?

22:27.560 --> 22:28.800
Did Buddy force you?

22:28.800 --> 22:29.840
                No!

22:29.840 --> 22:33.840
We were playing
and rubbing each other.

22:33.960 --> 22:35.120
           It felt good.

22:35.120 --> 22:36.400
I know the feeling.

22:36.400 --> 22:37.680
              You do?

22:37.680 --> 22:41.120
              You do?
All women do.  I wish they could.

22:41.120 --> 22:45.120
When was your last period?

22:45.400 --> 22:49.080
My mum knows. She always tells me
just before it's going to happen.

22:49.080 --> 22:50.280
     But this time she didn't.

22:50.280 --> 22:53.520
     But this time she didn't.
Pru, do you know
where babies come from?

22:53.520 --> 22:54.800
Uh-huh.
Where?

22:54.800 --> 22:56.800
              Heaven.

22:56.800 --> 23:00.800
Come on.

23:08.280 --> 23:12.280
Be right back.

23:15.960 --> 23:19.040
How's it going?

23:19.040 --> 23:20.880
I've been in there for over an hour.

23:20.880 --> 23:22.520
       I just couldn't ring the gong.

23:22.520 --> 23:24.400
                Flown solo too often.

23:24.400 --> 23:25.640
                Flown solo too often.
There's no rush.

23:25.640 --> 23:28.160
                Flown solo too often.
There's no rush.
    This is no time to drop the ball.

23:28.160 --> 23:31.480
I'm having trouble because
this has all become mechanical.

23:31.480 --> 23:35.040
Impersonal. Fluorescent lights,
linoleum floors.

23:35.040 --> 23:38.520
Voices over the intercom.
It's starting to get to me.

23:38.520 --> 23:42.520
It's not how I imagined
we'd create our child.

23:42.720 --> 23:44.160
(KNOCKS )Still having problems?

23:44.160 --> 23:46.640
When my father
explained the facts of life,

23:46.640 --> 23:50.000
he left out the part about having
to romance a plastic container.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.120
I brought the little something
from home that might help.

23:53.120 --> 23:57.120
Come on.

23:58.680 --> 24:02.680
What's the surprise?

24:04.240 --> 24:05.880
           Going. Going.

24:05.880 --> 24:07.640
             Going...

24:07.640 --> 24:10.600
               Gone.

24:10.600 --> 24:13.520
Have you experienced any
heaviness in the eyelids?

24:13.520 --> 24:17.520
Only during church sermons
and sex with my wife!

24:19.400 --> 24:22.920
This morning, you were talking
about maybe having some work done

24:22.920 --> 24:25.120
on the skin and
    muscles around your eyes.

24:25.120 --> 24:27.000
                 Yeah, I was kidding.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.920
Me and Liberace travel
in different circles.

24:30.920 --> 24:34.920
Here. Let me show you something.

24:35.280 --> 24:36.320
You see.

24:36.320 --> 24:39.920
Removing redundant tissue
    around the eyes,

24:39.920 --> 24:41.920
you look more energetic,
     more alert.

24:41.920 --> 24:45.120
I wouldn't mind shaving off
a couple of years.

24:45.120 --> 24:48.920
I'd have you on the table anyway.
It won't cost you anything.

24:48.920 --> 24:50.200
   My insurance will cover this?

24:50.200 --> 24:53.160
   My insurance will cover this?
Between you,
  me and the bedpan, no charge.

24:53.160 --> 24:56.360
           I don't know.

24:56.360 --> 24:57.880
        I've got to think.

24:57.880 --> 25:01.400
No hurry. I'll schedule some
extra time in the OR just in case.

25:01.400 --> 25:02.800
         To hell with it.

25:02.800 --> 25:06.800
Caldwell, make me look half
as good as the good half of you,

25:07.160 --> 25:11.160
    you've got yourself a deal.

25:15.800 --> 25:16.880
Victor? I need a consult.

25:16.880 --> 25:20.320
Victor? I need a consult.
Boomer, when was the last time you
figured out a case for yourself?

25:20.320 --> 25:23.560
Colonel Cochrane presented
  with semi-symmetric paralysis

25:23.560 --> 25:27.560
of the lower extremities,
   paresthesias. LP was normal.

25:28.080 --> 25:31.520
The history shows nothing.
    I can't make a connection.

25:31.520 --> 25:32.000
         Babinski reflex?

25:32.000 --> 25:33.080
         Babinski reflex?
Negative.

25:33.080 --> 25:35.560
That rules out CNS lesions.
Had a viral infection lately?

25:35.560 --> 25:37.560
That rules out CNS lesions.
Had a viral infection lately?
Just a cold.

25:37.560 --> 25:40.760
Look up Guillain-Barre Syndrome
in that little book of yours

25:40.760 --> 25:44.760
starts with G.
Do you have any change?

25:45.800 --> 25:48.480
You're good at diagnosis. Ever
think about becoming an internist?

25:48.480 --> 25:50.280
You're good at diagnosis. Ever
think about becoming an internist?
   What? And waste these hands?

25:50.280 --> 25:52.720
           No way, Jose.

25:52.720 --> 25:55.600
Mark, I thought I should tell you,

25:55.600 --> 25:59.240
I had to examine one of your grand
round patients today. Pru Dowler.

25:59.240 --> 26:00.600
What for?

26:00.600 --> 26:04.160
Hymenal bleeding. She lost her
virginity to another patient today.

26:04.160 --> 26:05.920
Who was the man?

26:05.920 --> 26:06.960
Who was the man?
           Buddy Askew.

26:06.960 --> 26:09.760
You're kidding. Was it rape?

26:09.760 --> 26:13.000
You're kidding. Was it rape?
No! It seems to be mutual
consent...and enjoyment.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.600
They're both of legal age.
They weren't bothering anybody.

26:16.600 --> 26:18.680
I suppose that makes it hunky-dory!

26:18.680 --> 26:20.080
I suppose that makes it hunky-dory!
  This kind of thing does happen.

26:20.080 --> 26:22.840
I suppose that makes it hunky-dory!
  This kind of thing does happen.
They're not minks, Roxanne!

26:22.840 --> 26:26.840
They developmentally-disabled tend
to be less inhibited about sex.

26:27.040 --> 26:30.640
Despite their age they still have
the same biological urges we do.

26:30.640 --> 26:34.080
Morality is what separates us
from animals and sailors on leave.

26:34.080 --> 26:38.080
Now, these people can't go around
copulating at the drop of a hat!

26:38.200 --> 26:40.760
If they can't be responsible,
  we have to be.

26:40.760 --> 26:42.240
We're just a hospital.

26:42.240 --> 26:45.080
Sex leads to procreation.
Who'd take care of the baby?

26:45.080 --> 26:48.000
Look at my granddaughter,
for crying out loud!

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
I'm having a social worker
inform the mother and talk
to Pru about birth control.

26:52.280 --> 26:53.520
Social worker?

26:53.520 --> 26:56.320
Social worker?
They're better equipped
to handle the situation.

26:56.320 --> 27:00.320
Those under-educated
libertarians will pat her head
      and give her the Pill.

27:00.440 --> 27:04.440
What she needs is a good
old-fashioned talking to.

27:04.760 --> 27:08.760
I'll speak to her myself. When I'm
 done, she'll know right from wrong.

27:14.720 --> 27:17.320
'This is Houston.
Mission completed.

27:17.320 --> 27:20.200
'You can wrap it
       up out there, Chuck.

27:20.200 --> 27:22.320
'I see something.

27:22.320 --> 27:23.760
'Nothing out there.

27:23.760 --> 27:25.560
'Nothing is something.

27:25.560 --> 27:29.160
'It's a vacuum, good buddy.
The big hoover.

27:29.160 --> 27:31.240
'Maybe that's just our perspective.

27:31.240 --> 27:33.200
'I breathe, therefore I am.

27:33.200 --> 27:35.280
'A limited point of view.

27:35.280 --> 27:39.280
'Computers' working on that
"Breathe, therefore I am" postulate.

27:39.360 --> 27:43.360
'If time and space are relative,
so is life.

27:43.720 --> 27:45.360
'What about God?

27:45.360 --> 27:48.960
'Ruler of the universe, maker
of all that is seen and unseen.

27:48.960 --> 27:50.920
'The alpha and omega.

27:50.920 --> 27:53.400
'We have no data on the
creator at this time.

27:53.400 --> 27:56.480
'Advise enlightenment
through annihilation is not,

27:56.480 --> 27:58.960
'repeat, not on flight plan.

27:58.960 --> 28:02.960
'Come on back inside.

28:03.600 --> 28:05.280
'You are dead now.  No.

28:05.280 --> 28:07.600
'Those are the rules.
Planet Earth is blue.

28:07.600 --> 28:10.960
'And there's nothing you can do.

28:10.960 --> 28:14.960
'Roger.'

28:20.360 --> 28:22.120
KNOCK AT THE DOOR

28:22.120 --> 28:23.040
Mmmm mm.

28:23.040 --> 28:24.520
Mmmm mm.
Ready to go?

28:24.520 --> 28:25.080
Where's Lizzy?

28:25.080 --> 28:26.120
Where's Lizzy?
I don't know.

28:26.120 --> 28:28.600
I told her to the back
     with the car in an hour.

28:28.600 --> 28:30.240
I told her to the back
     with the car in an hour.
                        Easy, Donald.

28:30.240 --> 28:32.840
You got the tubes out.
So she's 15 minutes late?

28:32.840 --> 28:36.080
She so damned irresponsible.
She only thinks about herself.

28:36.080 --> 28:37.680
She so damned irresponsible.
She only thinks about herself.
Boy.

28:37.680 --> 28:40.480
You two are amazing.
Apart, you rip into each other.

28:40.480 --> 28:42.960
Together, you're like
Heidi and her grandpa.

28:42.960 --> 28:45.040
No wonder you're at odds.
You don't relate honestly.

28:45.040 --> 28:46.400
No wonder you're at odds.
You don't relate honestly.
Stay out of this, please?

28:46.400 --> 28:47.920
               Why?

28:47.920 --> 28:51.120
Because I'm the voice
of sanity around here?

28:51.120 --> 28:54.200
Lizzy is a woman. Don't keep her
in pigtails and Mary Janes.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.320
        She'll resent you.

28:55.320 --> 28:58.040
You know why I don't come
    to Sunapee with the kids?

28:58.040 --> 29:02.040
I don't want to spend my
vacation with you telling me
        how to live my life.

29:06.680 --> 29:09.600
When you married Marie,
I became part of the family too.

29:09.600 --> 29:13.240
Believe me, it's no pleasure
watching you make mistakes.

29:13.240 --> 29:16.720
Right from the beginning, you
walked out on the rehearsal dinner.

29:16.720 --> 29:19.040
I had an emergency
      here at the hospital.

29:19.040 --> 29:20.880
  You had to handle it yourself?

29:20.880 --> 29:22.720
Yes! It was my patient.

29:22.720 --> 29:26.600
I still remember his name as
  a matter of fact. Eric Conzer.

29:26.600 --> 29:29.760
I did everything I could
for him, and he died anyway.

29:29.760 --> 29:31.320
Had a few drinks in his memory

29:31.320 --> 29:33.520
and when I got back, you were angry.

29:33.520 --> 29:36.680
and when I got back, you were angry.
You were smashed.
I was the maid of honour.

29:36.680 --> 29:40.680
Marie was afraid that night that you
would show up drunk for your wedding.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.560
      She worried about you.

29:42.560 --> 29:46.560
She made me promise that,
if anything happened to you,
I'd look after your kids.

29:46.880 --> 29:49.760
They're not your kids, Constance.

29:49.760 --> 29:53.760
She also asked me to look after you.
You know what?

29:55.240 --> 29:59.240
You're the one who
still needs it the most.

30:00.680 --> 30:03.920
Maybe it would be best if I went
back to Sunapee this afternoon.

30:03.920 --> 30:07.920
I'll leave a list of housekeepers
on your desk at home.

30:12.600 --> 30:16.600
Too bad Marie never knew you
and I didn't like each other.

30:22.480 --> 30:25.080
              Elliot!

30:25.080 --> 30:28.000
Marcy!

30:28.000 --> 30:30.120
You barely look like you.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.400
You barely look like you.
        And you look, er...

30:31.400 --> 30:32.600
The same.

30:32.600 --> 30:35.160
The same.
    You haven't lost an ounce.

30:35.160 --> 30:37.960
I nearly killed myself trying
to kiss 20lb goodbye.

30:37.960 --> 30:39.640
Just give me one more week, OK?

30:39.640 --> 30:40.840
Just give me one more week, OK?
   How could you do this to me!

30:40.840 --> 30:44.840
Just give me one more week, OK?
   How could you do this to me!
Please. Let's sit down, OK?

30:49.720 --> 30:53.720
Elliot, when I was in seventh
grade, all the girls were
growing these amazing bodies.

30:55.520 --> 30:59.520
I was the one in glasses
who breathed heavy and looked like
the young Tony Fields.

30:59.880 --> 31:03.880
Mum said it would change.
And it did. I started looking
like the old Tony Fields.

31:04.520 --> 31:08.520
You do better jokes.

31:08.680 --> 31:12.200
Losing weight, it's like
becoming a whole new person.

31:12.200 --> 31:15.280
It's time to see
what I've been missing.

31:15.280 --> 31:18.080
You know, move out of the house.
Show myself off.

31:18.080 --> 31:22.080
The problem is... You see,
I thought we'd both end up skinny

31:22.880 --> 31:25.360
and we could start
new lives together.

31:25.360 --> 31:29.360
Now I guess I'll just
have to go it alone.

31:30.120 --> 31:32.360
You mean, break up?

31:32.360 --> 31:36.080
You mean, break up?
I can't put my life on
hold to wait for you.

31:36.080 --> 31:37.360
Couldn't we still date?

31:37.360 --> 31:38.720
Couldn't we still date?
         I couldn't use you that way?

31:38.720 --> 31:42.040
Couldn't we still date?
         I couldn't use you that way?
Please! Use me!

31:42.040 --> 31:45.920
        I'm sorry, Elliot.

31:45.920 --> 31:49.920
It's been wonderful.
See you around, huh?

31:55.640 --> 31:57.480
Who's the good-looker?

31:57.480 --> 31:59.360
Who's the good-looker?
Marcy Eisenberg.

31:59.360 --> 32:00.440
Who's the good-looker?
Marcy Eisenberg.
Rosenthal's daughter?

32:00.440 --> 32:01.000
Uh-huh.

32:01.000 --> 32:05.000
Uh-huh.
I did know Helen had it in her.

32:21.400 --> 32:24.120
                Hi.

32:24.120 --> 32:28.040
I had the dream again today.

32:28.040 --> 32:30.880
It was different this time.

32:30.880 --> 32:32.160
I wasn't afraid.

32:32.160 --> 32:35.640
I was hanging under the satellite,

32:35.640 --> 32:39.640
and we begun to move toward
  a bright star, near Andromeda.

32:39.720 --> 32:40.800
KNOCK AT DOOR

32:40.800 --> 32:42.480
Mrs Cochrane.

32:42.480 --> 32:46.480
How are you feeling, Colonel?

32:50.440 --> 32:54.400
He couldn't even hold
a glass this morning.

32:54.400 --> 32:57.000
Is he going to be paralysed
for life?

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
Our examination indicates
you've got a disease
 called Guillain-Barre Syndrome.

33:01.720 --> 33:05.720
It's a temporary
neurological disorder
that affects motor function.

33:05.720 --> 33:08.080
The paralysis moves in stages
  upwards from the feet.

33:08.080 --> 33:10.080
The paralysis moves in stages
  upwards from the feet.
What causes it?

33:10.080 --> 33:11.000
We don't know.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.400
We don't know.
Is there anything you can do?

33:13.400 --> 33:16.920
No, there's no treatment. We wait
  for the disease to run its course.

33:16.920 --> 33:19.800
That could be anywhere
from two to four weeks.

33:19.800 --> 33:23.480
Or more, depending on how far the
paralysis advances before receding.

33:23.480 --> 33:27.480
Rehabilitation time varies,
but recovery is usually complete.

33:28.040 --> 33:32.040
Just a dream.

33:32.840 --> 33:35.800
I understand it now.

33:35.800 --> 33:37.080
What dream?

33:37.080 --> 33:40.200
The satellite was
pointing me towards a star.

33:40.200 --> 33:43.880
The Star of Bethlehem!

33:43.880 --> 33:45.640
Chuck, be quiet.

33:45.640 --> 33:48.800
Chuck, be quiet.
Don't you understand?

33:48.800 --> 33:52.120
This disease.

33:52.120 --> 33:55.480
I'm being cleansed.

33:55.480 --> 33:57.840
Paralysis will purify me
            so I'm worthy.

33:57.840 --> 33:59.400
Worthy of what?

33:59.400 --> 34:03.400
When I go in space next time...

34:06.280 --> 34:10.280
..I will walk with God.

34:25.239 --> 34:27.239
Hi, Pru. What are you doing?

34:27.239 --> 34:30.480
Hi, Pru. What are you doing?
                    I'm drawing. See.

34:30.480 --> 34:32.719
You like making pictures, huh?

34:32.719 --> 34:35.360
You like making pictures, huh?
    This one I made for my boyfriend.

34:35.360 --> 34:36.480
Buddy?

34:36.480 --> 34:38.440
Buddy?
              Hm-mm.

34:38.440 --> 34:41.719
Actually, that's what I came
to talk to you about.

34:41.719 --> 34:43.320
Actually, that's what I came
to talk to you about.
        You want to draw with me too?

34:43.320 --> 34:44.880
No.

34:44.880 --> 34:46.440
Pru,

34:46.440 --> 34:50.440
I have to talk to you about what
went on between you and Buddy.

34:52.639 --> 34:56.639
Now, you and he
     had sexual intercourse.

34:56.800 --> 34:58.160
You made love together.

34:58.160 --> 35:00.280
You made love together.
        Just like a circus.

35:00.280 --> 35:01.880
I suppose it might, but...

35:01.880 --> 35:05.040
I suppose it might, but...
     Do you like to make love?

35:05.040 --> 35:08.800
Pru...

35:08.800 --> 35:12.800
You can't go around making love
every time you feel like it.

35:14.280 --> 35:18.280
Now, society frowns
      on certain behaviour.

35:19.360 --> 35:23.360
Now, if you want be a good citizen,
you'll obey the rules.

35:23.680 --> 35:24.960
     Like cleaning up my room?

35:24.960 --> 35:27.840
You can't play with Buddy
    like that any more.

35:27.840 --> 35:30.360
             Why not?

35:30.360 --> 35:31.640
             Why not?
Because I say so.

35:31.640 --> 35:33.800
            Never ever?

35:33.800 --> 35:37.320
            Never ever?
Well, some day maybe.

35:37.320 --> 35:41.080
When you understand what sex means,
how babies are made.

35:41.080 --> 35:45.080
I mean there's more at stake
   than just...

35:45.760 --> 35:47.000
Feeling good.

35:47.000 --> 35:51.000
Do you follow what I'm saying?

35:52.680 --> 35:55.400
            A present.

35:55.400 --> 35:57.360
     You and me in the garden.

35:57.360 --> 36:01.360
         See the flowers?

36:02.360 --> 36:03.640
Thanks.

36:03.640 --> 36:07.640
Thanks.
         Kiss me goodbye?

36:07.640 --> 36:11.640
Yeah, sure.

36:23.720 --> 36:27.720
Bob. I've got to talk
     to you about Mr Boynton.

36:28.400 --> 36:30.000
  The pre-ops back from the lab?

36:30.000 --> 36:32.120
  The pre-ops back from the lab?
Yeah, CBC and electrolytes
          are normal.

36:32.120 --> 36:34.440
I see he's scheduled
for a blepharoplasty.

36:34.440 --> 36:36.160
 If you'd like to read the article

36:36.160 --> 36:39.120
in last month's journal
on the technique I'll be using.

36:39.120 --> 36:42.320
OK. I'll read it. But why
  is he having a blepharoplasty?

36:42.320 --> 36:43.360
OK. I'll read it. But why
  is he having a blepharoplasty?
He requested it.

36:43.360 --> 36:45.960
What? You mean on rounds yesterday?

36:45.960 --> 36:48.480
That was a remark.
Not an authorisation.

36:48.480 --> 36:51.960
We discussed the procedure
in greater detail today.

36:51.960 --> 36:54.320
Bob, I don't think...

36:54.320 --> 36:57.280
Are you sure Mr Boynton
    should be having this operation?

36:57.280 --> 36:58.280
   Ehrlich. What's the problem?

36:58.280 --> 37:01.120
   Ehrlich. What's the problem?
Candidates for plastic surgery
  are highly motivated

37:01.120 --> 37:04.520
to change their appearance.
 This guy's not given it thought.

37:04.520 --> 37:08.120
Ehrlich, if you don't want to
assist me, I can schedule Kylie.

37:08.120 --> 37:12.120
I need surgeries like this
    to complete my rotation.

37:12.120 --> 37:16.120
Then you've got a decision
to make, don't you?

37:21.480 --> 37:23.840
MUSIC PLAYS ON THE STEREO

37:23.840 --> 37:27.840
(ON STEREO)
# Working in a coal mine... #

37:28.680 --> 37:30.600
# Going down, down, down, down... #

37:30.600 --> 37:34.200
# Going down, down, down, down... #
        Just relax, Terry.

37:34.200 --> 37:37.560
How long since we did the lidocaine?

37:37.560 --> 37:40.120
How long since we did the lidocaine?
Five minutes.

37:40.120 --> 37:42.240
   There are the follicle cysts.

37:42.240 --> 37:45.400
There are four more on this side.

37:45.400 --> 37:47.720
It should be a good yield.

37:47.720 --> 37:51.000
May I see?

37:51.000 --> 37:53.280
           Right there.

37:53.280 --> 37:55.680
Each one of those contains an egg.

37:55.680 --> 37:58.720
I'll go in with a needle
and suck them out.

37:58.720 --> 38:02.240
After microscope confirmation that
we've collected the eggs,

38:02.240 --> 38:06.240
we'll send them to the lab where to
be fertilised with Ken's sperm.

38:06.280 --> 38:09.240
Two or three of them will be
implanted in your uterus,

38:09.240 --> 38:13.240
and the rest will be frozen in
case we need to try again.
Aspiration needle.

38:22.440 --> 38:26.440
Let's see if we can
get enough.

38:30.120 --> 38:32.360
Where's a doctor?
My husband needs help.

38:32.360 --> 38:33.400
Where's a doctor?
My husband needs help.
Mrs Cochrane?

38:33.400 --> 38:36.840
Chuck was talking and then suddenly
he couldn't catch his breath.

38:36.840 --> 38:40.840
Paralysis has probably moved into
the muscles that control his lungs.

38:43.600 --> 38:46.080
Respirations are 55 and shallow.

38:46.080 --> 38:47.760
When was the last
vital capacity taken?

38:47.760 --> 38:50.160
When was the last
vital capacity taken?
Four hours ago. 1.5 litres.

38:50.160 --> 38:53.520
We are going to have intubate.

38:53.520 --> 38:54.760
We need a crash cart...

38:54.760 --> 38:56.320
           Is he dying?

38:56.320 --> 38:59.040
           Is he dying?
No, we need to help him breathe.

38:59.040 --> 39:01.840
You can have all the air
    you need in just a second.

39:01.840 --> 39:05.840
       I'd better call NASA.

39:07.960 --> 39:10.680
Helen. Can I talk to you
for a second, please?

39:10.680 --> 39:14.680
Give me a hand. Maid service forgot
to do half the rooms on this floor.

39:14.680 --> 39:18.600
          Give me a hand.

39:18.600 --> 39:21.440
              OK. Up.

39:21.440 --> 39:22.800
Marcy broke up with me.

39:22.800 --> 39:24.760
Marcy broke up with me.
          Oh! I'm sorry.

39:24.760 --> 39:25.920
I don't know what to do.

39:25.920 --> 39:27.200
I don't know what to do.
       These things happen.

39:27.200 --> 39:28.640
Every damn day.

39:28.640 --> 39:32.000
Every damn day.
Not to me. You're her mother.
Can't you do something?

39:32.000 --> 39:35.360
Once Marcy makes up her mind,
she's pretty immune to pressure.

39:35.360 --> 39:37.160
I can't live without her.

39:37.160 --> 39:39.920
(CHUCKLES)
You'll live. Give it time.

39:39.920 --> 39:43.400
You'll find somebody else, there
are lots of other fish in the pond.

39:43.400 --> 39:46.640
Look at me. I'm still fat!
    I'm the eyesore!

39:46.640 --> 39:50.640
I'm the one who's going
to be buried in the piano crate!
It's not fair!

39:51.160 --> 39:53.760
Hah! Who said anything was fair!

39:53.760 --> 39:56.080
Life is always
   just outside the foul pole.

39:56.080 --> 39:59.920
Elliott, I don't know what
to tell you about being heavy.

39:59.920 --> 40:02.760
    If you want to lose, lose.

40:02.760 --> 40:04.560
        But not for Marcy.

40:04.560 --> 40:08.160
And not for vanity. And not
because somebody else tells you to.

40:08.160 --> 40:12.160
And you know what the first
thing is? Don't loathe yourself.

40:12.880 --> 40:14.480
I'm a drunk, like you're fat.

40:14.480 --> 40:18.320
Eating and drinking.
     They're both addictions.

40:18.320 --> 40:19.680
You can stop drinking.

40:19.680 --> 40:23.440
I need food to survive. There's
no such thing as cold turkey.

40:23.440 --> 40:26.360
Except after Thanksgiving.

40:26.360 --> 40:30.200
Nurse is right. Eating yourself up,
boy-o, that's the nub of it.

40:30.200 --> 40:32.080
Got to quit that first,
     at any rate.

40:32.080 --> 40:36.080
If you know all the answers,
how come you keep drinking?

40:36.200 --> 40:40.200
I enjoy beating myself up.

40:41.120 --> 40:45.120
Great(!)

40:45.760 --> 40:47.880
I bet you're anxious to get home.

40:47.880 --> 40:49.600
Your mum will be up in a minute.

40:49.600 --> 40:53.600
We're having hamburgers and
ice cream for a dinner tonight.

40:53.600 --> 40:56.320
Sounds like fun.

40:56.320 --> 40:59.240
Sounds like fun.
      Can I keep my bracelet?

40:59.240 --> 41:00.440
Sure you can.

41:00.440 --> 41:01.800
Sure you can.
           It's plastic.

41:01.800 --> 41:03.440
Hi.

41:03.440 --> 41:07.360
I came to say goodbye to Pru.

41:07.360 --> 41:11.360
I'll be down the hall
    in case you need anything.

41:17.440 --> 41:21.440
I'd like to lie down with you again.

41:21.520 --> 41:25.520
I promise I won't hurt you
like before. Cross my heart.

41:28.880 --> 41:32.880
The doctor said we shouldn't
touch each other any more.

41:32.880 --> 41:34.520
How come?

41:34.520 --> 41:38.040
How come?
           I'm not sure.

41:38.040 --> 41:40.160
          Some day maybe,

41:40.160 --> 41:44.160
but for now,
we need to be good citizens.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.920
      Tommy's in watching TV.

42:04.920 --> 42:08.400
He was pretty upset about Aunt
Constance leaving. Is she all right?

42:08.400 --> 42:09.760
Why do you ask?

42:09.760 --> 42:13.760
Why do you ask?
She just seemed to
have left so quickly.

42:14.080 --> 42:15.840
I'm tired.

42:15.840 --> 42:18.680
I said I'd bring him up
to Sunapee at semester break.

42:18.680 --> 42:20.360
Fine.

42:20.360 --> 42:22.480
I don't see why
you two don't get along.

42:22.480 --> 42:24.640
  She's got it so together, Dad.

42:24.640 --> 42:26.760
She was here
when you went to Africa.

42:26.760 --> 42:28.440
She gave you permission
     to travel with Rick.

42:28.440 --> 42:30.920
She gave you permission
     to travel with Rick.
   I made that decision myself.

42:30.920 --> 42:33.080
It really bugs me you didn't ask.

42:33.080 --> 42:35.080
It really bugs me you didn't ask.
 You would have gotten that look.

42:35.080 --> 42:36.320
So you lied to me.

42:36.320 --> 42:37.440
So you lied to me.
       I never lied to you.

42:37.440 --> 42:38.320
You just didn't tell the truth.

42:38.320 --> 42:39.360
You just didn't tell the truth.
        There's that look.

42:39.360 --> 42:41.240
Don't start with me, young lady.

42:41.240 --> 42:43.320
Don't start with me, young lady.
 Fine, Dad, I won't say anything.

42:43.320 --> 42:45.080
       Can't you understand?

42:45.080 --> 42:49.080
There are some decisions I want
to make without negotiating,
compromising or plea-bargaining.

42:50.120 --> 42:52.280
That's what's going to make
me an adult!

42:52.280 --> 42:55.400
In Ethiopia, I didn't know if
what you were doing was right,

42:55.400 --> 42:59.120
but I trusted you.
Do the same for me.

42:59.120 --> 43:03.120
Right, OK.

43:03.280 --> 43:04.760
Right, OK.
           You mean it?

43:04.760 --> 43:07.520
Sweetheart, I'm not perfect,
we both know that.

43:07.520 --> 43:11.120
But if we're going spend more time
together than the holidays,

43:11.120 --> 43:15.040
we're going to have to learn
to give each other room to change.

43:15.040 --> 43:19.040
           (I'm sorry.)

43:19.960 --> 43:21.520
PHONE RINGS

43:21.520 --> 43:24.760
I'll get it. I'll get it
downstairs, it's probably for me.

43:24.760 --> 43:28.760
 You need your sleep. Good night.

43:34.280 --> 43:36.880
The steam might do me some good.

43:36.880 --> 43:40.120
I got a little stiff playing
mixed doubles yesterday.

43:40.120 --> 43:43.840
I'm sorry about the
Residency Review Committee.

43:43.840 --> 43:46.600
                     I'm handling it.

43:46.600 --> 43:47.400
Hey, how's the wound?

43:47.400 --> 43:50.640
Hey, how's the wound?
                OK.

43:50.640 --> 43:54.120
This week started in the toilet,
then went straight down the sewer.

43:54.120 --> 43:57.000
Which is probably the only
   system in Boston that works.

43:57.000 --> 44:00.040
We've got nitwits
copulating in the corridors.

44:00.040 --> 44:03.680
And a judicial process
that flows like molasses.

44:03.680 --> 44:07.680
Sometimes you have to learn to
live with what fate dumps on you.

44:09.120 --> 44:13.120
Like hell you do. If I don't
like something, I change it.

44:16.080 --> 44:20.080
     I wish it were that easy.

44:57.760 --> 45:17.000
