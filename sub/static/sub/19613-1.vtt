07:42.000 --> 07:44.800
This is our masterpiece.

07:44.800 --> 07:47.500
It brings a tear to my eye.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.500
Vandals!

08:15.200 --> 08:17.000
Let's get them!

08:37.700 --> 08:39.500
That hurt.

09:41.500 --> 09:43.400
Ladies and gentlemen of the press...

09:43.500 --> 09:46.500
...welcome to
the lnternational Space Place.

09:48.300 --> 09:51.000
We at the Space Place
are proud to announce today...

09:50.900 --> 09:55.000
...that the long-awaited mission to Mars
mission is ready to be launched.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.500
We intend to prove positively...

09:58.600 --> 10:01.600
...that there is no life on the planet Mars.

10:01.700 --> 10:06.700
As you are all certainly aware, a mission
of this expense is very expensive.

10:06.600 --> 10:10.300
We just wouldn't shoot two knuckleheads
up there to try and hit Mars.

10:10.300 --> 10:14.200
No, sir. Hours of serious thought
have gone into this undertaking.

10:14.200 --> 10:17.900
And now let me introduce
our intrepid space travelers...

10:18.000 --> 10:22.800
...the only men we could find
that were bold enough to overlook...

10:22.800 --> 10:26.300
...certain shortcomings
and volunteer for this first-ever...

10:26.200 --> 10:28.000
...manned mission to Mars.

10:28.100 --> 10:32.900
I give you Majors Biff Buzzard
and Buzz Blister.

10:56.500 --> 10:58.200
Ladies and gentlemen...

10:58.400 --> 11:02.400
...the myth of little green men
will soon be put to rest.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.000
Little green men!

11:37.000 --> 11:39.700
Aliens. Real aliens.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.900
Hello.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.800
Welcome to Earth.

11:45.900 --> 11:49.400
We hope you have come in peace.

11:54.500 --> 11:57.700
Hey, wait a minute. They aren't aliens.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.800
Hey. You're right!

12:01.400 --> 12:03.200
It's a cat.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.600
And a mouse.

12:08.300 --> 12:09.500
Get them!

12:24.500 --> 12:26.200
Get them!

12:57.000 --> 13:00.900
Now, watch as I simply add
a single drop of water...

13:00.900 --> 13:05.000
...to this powdered pizza dinner, and:

13:11.900 --> 13:14.500
Delicious. Just like Mom tried to make.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.600
Get the stuff loaded
onto the rocket immediately.

14:17.300 --> 14:19.400
What is going on here?

14:19.700 --> 14:23.000
Well, sir, these here
dehydrated dinners...

14:23.000 --> 14:26.300
...exploded, and we don't
really know why.

14:26.400 --> 14:29.900
Well, obviously, they've been rehydrated.

14:29.900 --> 14:33.600
Yes. Well, sir, as near as we can tell,
the dinners got wet.

14:33.700 --> 14:36.700
Yes, that's what rehydrated means!

14:36.700 --> 14:38.400
Okay? And got wet real fast.

14:38.500 --> 14:42.500
And then it just sort of
went, well, kablooey.

14:42.500 --> 14:45.500
Look. Things just don't go kablooey
on their own.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.200
Things go kablooey
for a reason.

14:47.400 --> 14:50.900
There has to be a reason for things
going kablooey. Find that reason.

14:50.900 --> 14:53.600
Or, gentlemen, you will go kablooey!

14:53.600 --> 14:55.400
Yes, sir!

14:56.500 --> 14:58.200
Hey, a mouse!

14:58.300 --> 15:00.400
Mouse in the house!

15:00.700 --> 15:02.800
Get him! Catch him!

15:05.300 --> 15:07.500
I don't want to go kablooey....

15:08.400 --> 15:12.000
A mouse! Commander,
we have a mouse in the house!

15:11.900 --> 15:15.000
Yes, we know, doctor.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.100
Perhaps that pussycat
can be of use to us.

15:18.200 --> 15:22.500
Science has shown that cats harbor
an instinctive dislike for mice...

15:22.400 --> 15:23.900
...and rodents in general.

15:24.600 --> 15:26.100
Good thinking, Dr. Gluckman.

15:26.100 --> 15:30.000
Gentlemen, we need to
get that pussycat back.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.300
Perhaps this rehydrated fish
can be of use, sir.

15:40.900 --> 15:44.300
Okay, now, Earl, don't scare him off.

15:44.300 --> 15:47.000
Just take it slow. Take it slow.

15:47.100 --> 15:50.000
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty!

15:57.000 --> 15:58.500
Grab him.

15:58.600 --> 16:02.000
We have a job for you, Mr. Pussycat.

16:02.100 --> 16:05.900
Yeah, this is your big day.

16:09.500 --> 16:13.900
Mr. Pussycat, with this job
comes an awesome responsibility.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.400
Are you up to it?

16:19.100 --> 16:22.600
We have a mouse.
And it's up to you, Mr. Pussycat, to...

16:24.600 --> 16:25.800
...eliminate him.

16:28.400 --> 16:32.000
Do it for Earth, my boy-- Pussycat.

16:32.000 --> 16:36.200
Do it for the greater good.
Do it for science.

19:28.700 --> 19:30.300
-What was that?
-I don't know.

19:30.400 --> 19:32.800
Maybe one of the guys
dropped a wrench.

19:32.800 --> 19:36.200
Boy, this is gonna be the easiest
20 bucks we've ever made.

19:36.100 --> 19:39.700
Imagine anyone thinking that
there's such a thing as Martians.

19:39.800 --> 19:43.700
Well, I wouldn't be scared if we, you know,
met up with some real Martians.

19:43.700 --> 19:47.100
Well, I wouldn't either.

20:01.800 --> 20:05.200
Okay, men, we are just about ready
to begin countdown.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.900
Everything all set, up there?

20:07.000 --> 20:09.600
-Yes, sir.
-Roger that.

20:09.700 --> 20:11.700
Prepare ignition procedure.

20:12.400 --> 20:15.800
I have to go the little astronauts' room.

20:15.800 --> 20:17.800
You should have gone before we--

20:17.900 --> 20:21.900
-I know. My kidney weighs 20 pounds.
-How many times do I have to tell you?

20:22.000 --> 20:23.600
Okay, you two, knock it off.

20:23.900 --> 20:26.700
-This is serious.
-No, for real, I have to go.

20:27.900 --> 20:32.100
Eight, seven, six, five....

20:33.700 --> 20:35.000
Blast off!

21:24.700 --> 21:26.500
All systems go on our end.

21:26.700 --> 21:29.400
All systems go here as well.

21:29.400 --> 21:34.500
We are ready to jettison first-stage rocket
on your command, commander.

21:36.700 --> 21:38.400
I love this part.

21:42.700 --> 21:45.100
You are clear to jettison initial stage.

22:28.900 --> 22:30.900
This a breeze, Buzz.

22:31.100 --> 22:33.500
All systems are go.

22:36.200 --> 22:40.100
Congratulations, gentlemen,
you are now leaving Earth's atmosphere.

22:40.100 --> 22:43.700
Zero gravity should commence
right about...

22:44.800 --> 22:46.500
...now!

23:47.300 --> 23:49.200
It's an air leak.

23:50.900 --> 23:53.800
Radiation shields up.
Planetary arbitration disks online.

23:53.900 --> 23:56.100
Backup marine velocity centrometer.

23:56.200 --> 23:59.600
Repositioning flap cables.
Ion gauges tour-ready....

24:04.700 --> 24:06.000
Back up.

24:06.100 --> 24:08.800
It's the window in the second stage.
It's broken.

24:08.800 --> 24:10.500
Quick. Shut the emergency hatch.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.700
Boy, that was a close one.

24:30.800 --> 24:33.900
Too close. Should I engage
the artificial gravity now?

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
Sure. All this floating around
makes me nauseous.

25:07.500 --> 25:13.400
Sir, somehow the rocket's trajectory
has been discombobulated.

25:13.400 --> 25:15.300
Discombobulated.

25:18.000 --> 25:22.900
If isn't corrected, the rocket will crash
into the sun and be vaporized.

25:23.700 --> 25:27.700
I don't think the men will like this.
Maybe we can put it to them nicely.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.400
Hey, aren't we supposed to be
heading for the big red dot?

25:43.300 --> 25:47.300
Hey, yeah. Something's wrong.

25:47.400 --> 25:49.300
Yeah, I'll say.

25:57.400 --> 25:58.600
Hello, boys.

25:58.700 --> 26:00.400
-Hi, commander.
-Hi, commander.

26:00.500 --> 26:02.700
Listen, I don't want to
alarm you fellas...

26:02.800 --> 26:05.300
...but we have a teensy-weensy
little problem.

26:08.900 --> 26:12.700
It seems that the trajectory of the rocket
has gone a little bit....

26:12.700 --> 26:14.700
Well, a little bit funny.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.700
-Funny?
-Yes, that's right, funny.

26:17.700 --> 26:21.000
And it seems that if it's not corrected...

26:20.900 --> 26:25.400
...you two will crash into the sun
and you will be vaporized.

26:25.800 --> 26:28.200
You mean, we're gonna crash?

26:28.200 --> 26:30.800
That doesn't sound very funny to me.

26:30.900 --> 26:33.400
And me without my sunblock.

26:33.500 --> 26:36.200
One of you will have to
go outside the ship...

26:36.200 --> 26:38.400
...open the fuse box and, well--

26:38.500 --> 26:40.100
Jiggle the wire on the thingy!

26:40.200 --> 26:42.800
You mean that antenna thingy, sir?

26:42.900 --> 26:45.800
Yes, that's it, the antenna thingy.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.500
Rock beats a laser gun, right?

27:09.700 --> 27:11.900
No. No, it doesn't.

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000
Well, you win. You're just too good, Biff.
You always win.

27:15.900 --> 27:19.600
-Well, then, out you go.
-Right. That'll teach you.

27:22.400 --> 27:25.100
-Hey, wait a minute.
-Come on, man, hurry up.

27:25.200 --> 27:27.300
I don't wanna crash into the sun.

27:27.400 --> 27:29.000
I'm hurrying.

27:38.400 --> 27:40.100
Uh-oh.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.300
What's "uh-oh" mean?

27:42.800 --> 27:46.800
Somehow, we're going to light speed.

27:46.900 --> 27:48.400
Open this--

27:50.400 --> 27:52.600
Mother of pearl!

27:53.700 --> 27:57.800
Can't reach lever.

27:58.700 --> 28:00.700
Make it stop!

28:01.000 --> 28:02.600
Mommy!

28:33.900 --> 28:36.900
Well, men, there she is.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.800
-What?
-Mars.

28:39.900 --> 28:42.700
-Where?
-The big red thing underneath you.

28:43.700 --> 28:46.800
-Oh, that. Yes, wow.
-Oh, that. Yes, wow.

28:46.900 --> 28:50.700
Yes, "wow" is right.
So the big moment is here, everybody.

28:52.900 --> 28:55.700
Okay, prepare the lander.

28:55.700 --> 28:58.600
You know, maybe we should
wait a minute or two.

28:58.700 --> 29:02.600
Yeah, you know,
just to sort of get used to this.

29:02.500 --> 29:05.900
-Yeah.
-Get in that lander, you two knuckleheads!

29:05.900 --> 29:09.000
Or we might just decide
to leave you up there.

30:11.100 --> 30:12.800
Well, here we are, Biff.

30:12.900 --> 30:15.600
The first men on Mars.

30:22.500 --> 30:25.700
Well, we're not exactly on Mars yet.

30:25.800 --> 30:28.400
No, but we will be, in a second.

30:28.500 --> 30:31.900
This doesn't look anything
like the Mars we see in movies.

30:31.900 --> 30:35.300
Yes, chum, this is nothing like
the angry red planet.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.400
I don't see any monsters.

30:37.500 --> 30:39.700
I was looking forward
to battling monsters.

30:39.800 --> 30:42.600
This is more boring
than shopping with your wife.

30:42.700 --> 30:44.400
Doesn't look like much, does it?

30:44.500 --> 30:48.100
Just as we thought,
a completely lifeless hulk.

30:51.900 --> 30:54.900
So who wants to be
the first man on Mars, you?

30:59.200 --> 31:00.500
Congratulations.

31:00.700 --> 31:02.200
Very funny.

31:49.500 --> 31:53.300
Astonishing. Zillions of dollars spent.

31:53.300 --> 31:56.100
Massive amounts
of research and training.

31:56.200 --> 32:00.600
All geared toward answering
man's most compelling of questions:

32:01.700 --> 32:04.300
Are we alone?

32:05.900 --> 32:09.200
Well, sort of looks like it,
for the moment, anyway.

32:10.700 --> 32:14.900
No. I mean, is humanity alone, here,
among the vastness of space?

32:15.100 --> 32:20.200
Are we to find other life amongst
this inconceivable immensity of galaxies...

32:20.200 --> 32:24.700
...and clusters of galaxies and clusters
of clusters which are speeding apart...

32:24.700 --> 32:28.400
...into the ever-expanding distance?
Is mankind all there is?

32:28.400 --> 32:30.700
And what is man really, Buzz?

32:32.700 --> 32:36.300
I'll tell you. We are a recently developed
scurf on the epidermis...

32:36.400 --> 32:39.200
...of one of the satellites
of a star in the arm...

32:39.300 --> 32:42.400
...of an average galaxy,
amidst the lesser clusters...

32:42.400 --> 32:45.500
...among the thousands
catapulting apart, which took form...

32:45.600 --> 32:48.300
...some 15 billion years ago
as a consequence...

32:48.300 --> 32:51.400
...of an inconceivable preternatural event.

32:51.400 --> 32:53.100
Right.

32:53.800 --> 32:56.400
I don't see a thing,
if that's what you mean.

32:57.400 --> 33:01.700
Nope. Guess that answers that question.
Let's hit it.

37:53.900 --> 37:56.500
Ubu! No!

38:09.200 --> 38:13.200
It's very rude to point laser guns
at strangers.

38:18.500 --> 38:19.900
Peep, what have you found?

38:19.900 --> 38:23.600
What do you make
of this strange creature, Grob?

38:25.900 --> 38:27.900
Doesn't look like
he's from around here.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.700
He might taste good.

38:29.800 --> 38:33.900
True. In the right sauce,
he might make a fine main course...

38:33.900 --> 38:35.700
...for His Royal Martian Majesty.

38:35.800 --> 38:39.200
No, you fools. Look closer.

38:39.300 --> 38:44.500
Does he not resemble the figure
from the ancient scrolls?

38:45.000 --> 38:48.700
Great bouncing Squitsnarfuls,
Grob is right.

38:48.800 --> 38:52.900
He looks just like the Great Gloop.
You know, the brave Skweep Squeezer...

38:52.900 --> 38:55.200
...from Planus Nine.

38:55.700 --> 39:01.200
The one of who it is said will bring
great wisdom to our people.

39:03.800 --> 39:08.300
I don't think so.
I think he's just a cute alien.

39:08.200 --> 39:12.900
If he is, that means
the ancient prophecies are right.

39:12.900 --> 39:14.700
What joy.

39:14.900 --> 39:18.900
At last, the Great Gloop has come.

39:18.900 --> 39:23.300
If so, we must take him back
to the palace and pay homage to him.

39:24.100 --> 39:27.000
Yeah, okay.
I'm not exactly certain he's....

39:27.000 --> 39:29.300
All hail the Great Gloop!

39:29.400 --> 39:32.700
Hail! Hail! Hail!

39:33.800 --> 39:36.300
We must bring him to King Thingg.

39:36.600 --> 39:38.200
And so we shall.

39:45.300 --> 39:46.800
We must move quickly.

39:46.800 --> 39:50.200
Soon the Martian desert
will be crawling with Pootsnarfuls...

39:50.300 --> 39:54.100
...and many other unsavory creatures
of night. It will not be safe.

39:54.000 --> 39:57.800
Come. We have gone too far.
We have time to lose.

39:57.700 --> 40:01.100
I mean, come, we have far to go,
we have no time to lose.

40:01.200 --> 40:02.400
That's better.

40:02.500 --> 40:05.100
Oh, "smegnar." I always mess that up.

40:11.300 --> 40:13.500
A Pootsnarful! After it!

40:13.700 --> 40:18.100
It has the Great Gloop and Peep!
We must save them!

40:44.900 --> 40:48.900
Careful! Do not shoot!
You may hit Peep or the Great Gloop.

40:48.800 --> 40:51.500
Well, what should we do?

41:35.100 --> 41:37.300
You saved me.

41:40.500 --> 41:42.800
Sorry about that, Great Gloop.

42:01.400 --> 42:03.200
Behold, Great Gloop...

42:03.300 --> 42:07.100
...our fair Martian city, Toledo.

42:19.300 --> 42:22.900
Who goes there? Friend...

42:22.900 --> 42:25.000
-...or not a friend?
-Friend.

42:25.000 --> 42:29.100
It is l, Grob. I have great news
for His Highness, King Thingg...

42:29.100 --> 42:31.500
...and must have
an immediate audience.

42:53.300 --> 42:56.600
My favorite Martians...

42:59.400 --> 43:03.300
...I present to you his supreme majesty...

43:03.300 --> 43:09.600
...the imperious ruler of the red planet,
keeper of the Squink-diddlies of Sprong...

43:09.700 --> 43:15.200
...holder of the scepter of Fleebis,
and all-around swell guy...

43:15.200 --> 43:18.100
...King Thingg!

43:25.800 --> 43:27.600
King Thingg!

43:45.700 --> 43:47.700
Workman's comp....

43:48.900 --> 43:52.000
I've fallen, and I can't rule.

43:54.100 --> 43:56.500
Make it stop. Make it stop.

43:57.600 --> 44:00.400
Must put in elevator.

44:02.200 --> 44:04.000
My crown....

44:07.800 --> 44:12.200
Bruising. Bruise. Painful. Broken bones.

44:13.600 --> 44:16.800
I meant to do that.

44:19.500 --> 44:22.100
I believe him to be the Great Gloop...

44:22.200 --> 44:25.300
...the one spoken of in the ancient scrolls.

44:28.700 --> 44:32.600
You are correct, Grob.
It is he, the Great Gloop.

44:32.700 --> 44:36.100
The Great Gloop has returned to us.

44:41.100 --> 44:45.200
At last! What a great day.

44:45.400 --> 44:49.000
Let the celebration begin.

45:59.400 --> 46:03.300
In exchange for the infinite wisdom
you will bring to us...

46:03.300 --> 46:06.200
...we offer you these gifts.

46:10.800 --> 46:12.300
Sire....

46:12.400 --> 46:15.700
How dare you interrupt the royal feast.

46:15.800 --> 46:21.600
I'm sorry, sire, but a giant
has infiltrated the walls of the city.

46:21.500 --> 46:26.300
Is this a joke?
There are no such things as giants!

46:28.100 --> 46:30.300
A giant!

47:44.300 --> 47:46.100
Fellow Martians!

47:46.100 --> 47:49.900
Because this fuzzy giant monster
has made a shambles...

47:50.000 --> 47:54.400
...of our lovely city, he will be dumped
in the hole with Ted...

47:54.400 --> 47:57.300
...the flesh-eating lava-dweller.

48:01.700 --> 48:05.400
The Great Gloop will be given
the honor of pulling the lever...

48:05.400 --> 48:10.100
...sending this destructive
and fuzzy giant to his doom.

48:11.800 --> 48:14.400
You may pull this when ready,
Great Gloop.

48:20.300 --> 48:23.700
-Just give it a pull.
-Wait. Hold it. Stop.

48:23.700 --> 48:27.800
This is not the Great Gloop.

48:27.800 --> 48:29.100
He is an impostor.

48:30.600 --> 48:32.100
What do you mean?

48:32.200 --> 48:33.700
They are aliens.

48:33.900 --> 48:37.300
From-- From Earth.

48:37.700 --> 48:40.100
-Earth?
-Earthlings?

48:40.200 --> 48:42.400
-Aliens.
-Aliens.

48:42.400 --> 48:46.400
Nonsense! There is no life on Earth.
Is there?

48:46.500 --> 48:49.100
Apparently so, my king.

48:49.200 --> 48:52.800
You see, a spacecraft was detected
on our scopes earlier.

48:52.900 --> 48:56.900
It landed, and stayed only long enough
to drop these two invaders off.

48:58.800 --> 49:01.700
They must be the first wave
of an invasion.

49:01.700 --> 49:05.700
One pretends to be the Great Gloop,
and the other destroys our city.

49:05.700 --> 49:09.300
So try to take over Mars, will you...

49:09.600 --> 49:11.700
...Earthling?

50:14.300 --> 50:16.300
They're getting away.

50:16.400 --> 50:19.700
Peep is a traitor.
She helped the invaders escape.

50:33.800 --> 50:35.800
Okay. That's all right.

50:35.800 --> 50:37.400
You're welcome. No, that's--

50:37.500 --> 50:40.100
That's okay--
Okay, you're welcome. Okay.

50:40.200 --> 50:44.900
Look, I know my people are going to plan
an invasion of your planet in retaliation.

50:44.900 --> 50:47.700
We have to get you back there
so you can warn them.

50:48.400 --> 50:52.100
We'll have to sneak back to the city
and steal a saucer.

50:52.200 --> 50:55.300
Can either of you pilot
a flying saucer?

50:58.700 --> 51:01.200
Well, that figures. Okay, come on.

51:01.300 --> 51:04.000
We'd better hurry. Follow me.

51:05.600 --> 51:08.100
Today, we invade Earth.

51:08.200 --> 51:11.100
Prepare the saucers.

51:16.400 --> 51:19.200
We've got to get into
one of those saucers.

51:19.200 --> 51:22.400
All pilots report to your saucers
and prepare for liftoff.

51:22.500 --> 51:24.700
Our target, Earth!

51:25.800 --> 51:30.700
Okay, boys, this is it.
The fate of your home planet is at stake.

51:33.800 --> 51:36.800
There's our saucer. Let's go.

52:07.900 --> 52:11.300
Close the hatch.
We gotta get out of here fast.

52:11.400 --> 52:13.400
Press that one.

52:13.400 --> 52:16.200
No, not that--

52:45.000 --> 52:48.100
Oh, launch the lnvince-a-tron.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.100
Get that thing fixed!

53:04.500 --> 53:06.900
Mission control, this is Mars One.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.800
We are entering the atmosphere now.

53:10.100 --> 53:13.400
Well, men, they should be
landing any second.

53:34.500 --> 53:36.600
You guys need a maid.

53:59.600 --> 54:01.000
What's that noise?

54:01.900 --> 54:04.600
Oh, an asteroid field.

54:05.100 --> 54:06.500
An asteroid field?!

54:09.300 --> 54:12.700
Remind me never to let you drive again.

54:34.500 --> 54:36.100
Okay.

54:47.700 --> 54:51.200
Well, it's about time, general.

55:02.900 --> 55:04.600
Come on!

55:23.600 --> 55:27.500
And so, ladies and gentlemen of the press,
without further delay...

55:27.400 --> 55:30.600
...I give you Buzz Blister
and Biff Buzzard...

55:30.700 --> 55:34.900
...the brave astronauts who made
this mission the success that it was.

55:34.900 --> 55:36.700
Gentlemen?

55:40.400 --> 55:42.100
So is there life on Mars?

55:42.200 --> 55:44.500
Say, do we have to worry
about an invasion...

55:44.500 --> 55:47.400
...of extraterrestrial alien Martians
from outer space?

55:47.500 --> 55:50.600
I'm here to tell you all,
my inquisitive friends...

55:50.700 --> 55:54.100
...once and for all, there is absolutely...

55:54.600 --> 55:58.800
...unequivocally, no life on Mars.

55:59.100 --> 56:00.600
Martians?!

56:08.600 --> 56:11.200
Say, these are tiny.

56:11.700 --> 56:14.300
He's right. Look, it's like a toy.

56:16.900 --> 56:22.500
What could this little thing possibly do
to a big, strong astronaut like me?

56:22.500 --> 56:25.900
All we need are some fly swatters
to combat this alien menace.

56:28.300 --> 56:31.100
Say, they're kind of cute.

56:36.100 --> 56:39.700
Biff! Speak to me, chum.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
No!

56:57.000 --> 57:00.100
Come on, Gluckman!
You're a scientist. What do we do?

57:00.100 --> 57:02.100
I.... I don't know.

57:02.300 --> 57:03.900
This is unprecedented.

57:03.900 --> 57:06.900
Come on, use that brain of yours,
you worthless egghead!

57:43.800 --> 57:45.000
Earthlings!

57:49.800 --> 57:51.800
Is this thing on?

57:51.800 --> 57:55.100
Earthlings, we are taking over
your planet.

57:55.100 --> 57:57.400
Right. Now, listen up.

57:57.500 --> 58:01.000
We Martians are in charge now, and--

58:08.500 --> 58:10.200
Get that saucer's number.

58:28.100 --> 58:29.600
-But who?
-Why?

58:29.700 --> 58:30.800
What?

58:34.500 --> 58:35.800
Hey.

58:36.200 --> 58:40.200
-It's that crazy pussycat.
-Yeah, and he caught the mouse.

58:40.700 --> 58:42.600
Two mice.

58:42.700 --> 58:46.000
Wait a minute. She's one of them!

58:50.300 --> 58:51.900
Reintegrate them with this.

58:53.000 --> 58:54.200
Trust me.

59:24.700 --> 59:27.100
Biff! They've saved us.

59:27.400 --> 59:32.000
So they did.
Maybe Martians aren't so bad after all.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.700
It's the lnvince-a-tron!

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:24.100
It's using its vacuum.
Quick, back to the saucer!

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:32.300
Wait. Don't leave us here.

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:39.000
Stop! Wait for us!

01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:42.500
We'll press charges,
you Martian menace!

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:40.000
Thanks.

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:46.800
Now, let's head right for him!

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:10.100
Ready?

01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:12.300
Here we go!

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:20.400
I'm alive! I'm a--

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:03.700
Mr. Pussycat, Mr. Mouse
and Miss Martian...

01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:05.300
...how can we ever repay you?

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:09.200
The entire planet owes you
a debt of gratitude.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:20.400
If not for your ultra-neato strategy
and "braverosity"--

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:23.700
You know what I mean.
All would have been lost.

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:27.400
Okay, on behalf of all of these people
on Earth, I thank you.

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:29.200
Here's a Hummer.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.900
Hey, need a lift?

01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:24.800
-You and your big mouth.
-Yeah?

01:08:25.399 --> 01:08:28.000
How'd you like a free trip to Mars?

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.500
I already had one, thanks!
