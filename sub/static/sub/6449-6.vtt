33:39.267 --> 33:43.761
Drop your weapon
and beg for forgiveness.

33:44.981 --> 33:46.892
No, I don't think you get it.

33:47.817 --> 33:51.184
He is a messenger sent from the heavens.

33:53.781 --> 33:54.987
I don't believe you.

33:57.452 --> 33:58.658
Lois.

33:58.828 --> 34:00.614
Oh, you better believe it.

34:00.788 --> 34:02.779
Because if you don't listen...

34:02.957 --> 34:06.825
...he will strike down upon thee...

34:07.003 --> 34:10.211
...with great vengeance
and furious anger.

34:11.215 --> 34:16.755
And he will use his heat vision
to raze your village...

34:17.263 --> 34:19.970
...and his super-breath
to smite your crops!

34:20.475 --> 34:21.590
Amen.

34:23.436 --> 34:28.146
What do you say you speed us away
from these Children of the Corn, honey?

34:55.676 --> 34:58.509
Is this all that you were able to make?

35:00.348 --> 35:02.304
Considering we just found the research...

35:02.475 --> 35:06.514
...we were only able to synthesize
a small amount, but it's a start.

35:08.689 --> 35:11.647
You said Alexander's condition
was irreversible.

35:11.818 --> 35:13.809
That's what we believed.

35:14.570 --> 35:17.482
But on your advice, we scoured
the LuthorCorp database...

35:17.657 --> 35:19.943
...and came across
Peter Dinsmore's work.

35:20.159 --> 35:23.196
He's the architect of Lionel Luthor's
genetic engineering program.

35:23.371 --> 35:25.362
He cloned his own daughter...

35:25.540 --> 35:29.954
...and encountered the same
accelerated mitosis complication.

35:30.378 --> 35:33.745
But I was able to use his research
and formulate that serum.

35:33.965 --> 35:35.250
A cure...

35:35.883 --> 35:37.168
...to save Alexander.

35:37.510 --> 35:39.341
It's the breakthrough we wanted.

35:49.564 --> 35:53.523
This could be the redemption
we both have been praying for.

36:00.741 --> 36:03.232
I wanted so badly...

36:03.411 --> 36:05.242
...to save that little boy.

36:15.631 --> 36:18.543
Miss Mercer, what are you doing?

36:19.218 --> 36:21.504
Destroy all of your research.

36:22.221 --> 36:26.260
And in the morning,
he'll be locked up again...

36:26.434 --> 36:28.641
...for everyone's safety.

36:28.811 --> 36:31.598
If we don't begin his therapy,
he'll be dead in six weeks.

36:31.772 --> 36:33.433
That's the point.

36:33.900 --> 36:36.437
Because he's notjust a clone.

36:37.028 --> 36:38.814
He is Lex Luthor.

36:50.917 --> 36:54.125
It seems our Stephen King's romp
in the backwoods...

36:54.295 --> 36:58.789
...bumped Cat Grant's anti-hero crusade
from column one.

37:00.968 --> 37:05.632
Leave it to Lois and Clark to turn a quiet
day in the country into a major scoop.

37:05.806 --> 37:09.014
Friends at the bureau said our
Koresh wannabes were so low proﬁle...

37:09.185 --> 37:10.846
...they weren't on anybody's radar.

37:11.062 --> 37:14.475
I just wish we'd found them sooner.
We could've saved so many lives.

37:16.817 --> 37:19.103
I don't understand
how believers would allow themselves...

37:19.278 --> 37:21.655
...to be led down such a dark path.

37:24.367 --> 37:26.358
I guess there's so much chaos
out there...

37:26.577 --> 37:31.196
...people are just desperate
for something to give them hope.

37:31.374 --> 37:36.084
Now more than ever,
the world needs someone to believe in.

37:36.879 --> 37:40.838
-I think I know where this is going.
-Hear me out, Clark.

37:41.008 --> 37:43.841
Hey, I wasn't a big fan
of Ollie's coming-out party...

37:44.303 --> 37:48.137
...and I used to think that it was best
for you to stay in the shadows too...

37:49.308 --> 37:53.847
...but maybe, someday soon,
you'll have to step into the light.

37:54.855 --> 37:59.519
You could be a symbol to inspire everyone
that this planet could be a better place.

37:59.860 --> 38:03.193
I'm not sure anyone is ready to believe
in a stranger from a strange land.

38:03.364 --> 38:04.729
Hmm.

38:04.907 --> 38:07.740
If they know the real Clark Kent...

38:07.910 --> 38:12.654
...then I am sure the rest of the world
will believe in you as much as I do.

38:14.625 --> 38:18.243
I'm sorry I was so overprotective.
I was trying to keep you safe.

38:18.421 --> 38:20.537
If it wasn't for you...

38:20.715 --> 38:23.422
...I would be a crispy critter in Hellsville.

38:23.634 --> 38:26.376
No. You held your own...

38:27.388 --> 38:29.219
...even when I didn't have my powers.

38:30.391 --> 38:32.256
Lois, you saved my life.

38:33.060 --> 38:35.893
Guess there's enough danger out there
for everyone.

38:37.023 --> 38:40.231
We just have to trust that we'll always
be there for each other...

38:40.401 --> 38:42.562
...when times get tough.

38:50.911 --> 38:53.243
Which is why I want you to have this.

38:54.165 --> 38:55.780
LOIS:
Uh....

39:01.172 --> 39:04.084
The unabridged user's guide
to all things Kryptonian?

39:04.800 --> 39:07.257
It may ﬁll in a few blanks.

39:12.767 --> 39:15.383
I want you to know me completely,
with no secrets.

39:18.981 --> 39:20.937
Because you're the one...

39:21.609 --> 39:23.600
...you always will be.

42:19.286 --> 42:21.277
