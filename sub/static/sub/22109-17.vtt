WEBVTT

00:04.072 --> 00:06.640
Stick close by, kids,
and I'll explain everything

00:06.674 --> 00:08.676
you need to know
about the briny deep.

00:08.709 --> 00:11.212
I want to see a giant squid
attack a sperm whale

00:11.245 --> 00:12.680
and battle to the death.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.548
I want to swim free
with the fishes.

00:14.582 --> 00:16.550
I brought
my lucky red swim trunks.

00:16.584 --> 00:18.686
All right, can the chatter
and listen up.

00:18.719 --> 00:21.089
Here we have
the hideous moray eel.

00:21.122 --> 00:25.159
And over here, we have the tasty
but repulsive sea bass.

00:25.193 --> 00:27.728
Yuck! What the hell is that?

00:27.761 --> 00:29.397
-Bart!
-(gurgling): Come on in.

00:29.430 --> 00:31.065
The water's fine.

00:32.300 --> 00:34.902
Boy, you come out of that tank
right now!

00:34.935 --> 00:36.537
Do some tricks, Bart.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.539
-Oh!
-Stop that.

00:38.572 --> 00:40.741
It only encourages him.

00:40.774 --> 00:43.043
Ah!

00:43.077 --> 00:45.045
Dad, you got to see this!

00:45.079 --> 00:46.914
(Homer screams)

00:49.483 --> 00:52.420
* The Simpsons *

00:52.453 --> 00:54.054
(audio rewinds)

00:54.088 --> 00:56.457
* The Simpso... *

00:56.490 --> 00:58.058
(audio rewinds)

00:58.092 --> 01:00.928
* The Simpsons *

01:05.399 --> 01:07.000
(exclaims)

01:18.679 --> 01:21.081
(school bell rings)

01:22.583 --> 01:23.951
(burps)

01:23.984 --> 01:25.919
(whistle blows)

01:25.953 --> 01:27.788
LENNY:
Oh, not again!

01:31.925 --> 01:33.427
(beeps)

01:36.830 --> 01:38.799
*

01:38.832 --> 01:40.801
(playing lively jazz music)

01:43.871 --> 01:45.473
(Largo grunts)

01:50.944 --> 01:53.281
(chuckles)
I nailed it.

01:53.314 --> 01:55.783
I have tears in my eyes,

01:55.816 --> 01:59.019
like when I saw David
Attenborough's Blue Planet.

01:59.052 --> 02:00.854
Did you really watch them all?

02:00.888 --> 02:02.923
Well, most of the first one.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.326
-LARGO: Lisa?
-Yes, Mr. Largo?

02:05.359 --> 02:08.529
-I just want to say...
-And I just want to listen.

02:08.562 --> 02:10.164
RALPH:
I'm a tuna!

02:10.198 --> 02:11.999
You really should give up
the saxophone.

02:12.032 --> 02:13.301
What?!

02:13.334 --> 02:15.035
Oh, I know. I know.
You're fabulous.

02:15.068 --> 02:16.837
Well, then I shouldn't
give it up.

02:16.870 --> 02:18.972
I mean, what would you say
if I said

02:19.006 --> 02:20.508
you had to give up
teaching music?

02:20.541 --> 02:21.942
I'd say, "Hallelujah!"

02:21.975 --> 02:25.078
I could go back to my first
love: not teaching music.

02:26.814 --> 02:29.850
We can't do the couch gag.
When is Lisa gonna get here?

02:29.883 --> 02:31.552
Worry about yourself.

02:35.323 --> 02:38.392
Why would you ask me
to give up the saxophone?

02:38.426 --> 02:39.860
Lisa, sweetie, I'm afraid

02:39.893 --> 02:41.729
this world is filled
with Lisa Simpsons.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.864
-Huh?
-Bright, talented

02:43.897 --> 02:46.133
and doomed to disappointment.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.369
What you're saying is horrible.

02:48.402 --> 02:51.405
It's horrible. (crying)

02:51.439 --> 02:53.641
Mr. Largo,
what is going on here?

02:53.674 --> 02:55.376
I'm trying
to encourage a student

02:55.409 --> 02:57.077
to give up on her dreams!

02:57.110 --> 02:59.079
You're crushing it
as always, Dewey.

02:59.112 --> 03:02.049
-(Lisa cries)
-I'll take it from here.

03:02.082 --> 03:04.051
Now, Lisa,
this is for your own good.

03:04.084 --> 03:07.221
For every Yo-Yo Ma,
there's a million Ma-Ma Yos.

03:07.255 --> 03:08.822
And for every Shaun White,

03:08.856 --> 03:10.758
there are a million
White Shauns.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.526
And for every Albert Einstein,

03:12.560 --> 03:15.028
there are a million
Herman Schmidbergs.

03:15.062 --> 03:17.265
Okay, so maybe
I'll never be great,

03:17.298 --> 03:19.233
but shouldn't I try?

03:19.267 --> 03:20.768
(chuckles) No.

03:20.801 --> 03:23.604
(crying)

03:23.637 --> 03:25.939
(kids chattering playfully)

03:32.546 --> 03:34.448
(laughter)

03:34.482 --> 03:37.017
Sleeping people are my canvas.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.419
(whimpers)

03:38.452 --> 03:41.555
That's some cutting satire,
Simpson.

03:41.589 --> 03:44.224
Yeah. Check out Bill Maher
over here.

03:44.258 --> 03:45.759
(whimpers)

03:45.793 --> 03:47.227
Ay, caramba!

03:47.261 --> 03:49.297
Let's see. Little Bo Peep?

03:49.330 --> 03:51.299
That'll traumatize him good.

03:51.332 --> 03:54.134
Oh, I got it, the perfect one.

03:54.167 --> 03:56.370
No, not that.
Anything but that!

03:56.404 --> 03:58.138
Oh, thanks for your input.

03:58.171 --> 04:00.173
I'll try to come up
with an alternative.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.243
Put it on.

04:03.277 --> 04:04.578
-(door opens)
-JIMBO: Get in there.

04:04.612 --> 04:05.579
(kids gasp)

04:05.613 --> 04:09.149
(laughter)

04:09.182 --> 04:11.251
Sing like we rehearsed!

04:11.285 --> 04:14.588
* The sun'll come out
tomorrow... *

04:14.622 --> 04:15.989
More pep!

04:16.023 --> 04:19.159
* Bet your bottom dollar
that tomorrow *

04:19.192 --> 04:21.161
* There'll be sun! *

04:21.194 --> 04:24.131
Sing until food fills
your mouth!

04:24.164 --> 04:26.667
* Tomorrow, tomorrow *

04:26.700 --> 04:29.503
(gagging):
* I love ya tomorrow! *

04:29.537 --> 04:33.240
(muffled):
* You're always a day away. *

04:33.273 --> 04:35.275
Now get the Wite-Out.

04:38.446 --> 04:40.481
Leapin' lizards!

04:40.514 --> 04:42.182
He's right.

04:42.215 --> 04:44.352
I know it's true. I always have.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.354
Honey, ignore everyone,

04:46.387 --> 04:49.790
and listen to someone objective:
your mother.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.425
You're great!

04:51.459 --> 04:53.961
It's too late.
I'm quitting music.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.696
There's a microscope
in there, too.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.197
You can sell it.

04:57.230 --> 04:58.999
Don't give up your dream.

04:59.032 --> 05:02.603
When I was little, I dreamed
about marrying a dashing prince,

05:02.636 --> 05:04.772
and it actually happened!

05:04.805 --> 05:06.674
You were married before Dad?

05:06.707 --> 05:08.709
No! I mean your father.

05:08.742 --> 05:11.812
My father.
So that's Homer, or...

05:11.845 --> 05:13.847
There's no "or"!

05:13.881 --> 05:16.950
You can't let someone else's
opinion tear you down.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.052
I want to hear your sweet music,

05:19.086 --> 05:23.323
so suck it in
and get downstairs right now!

05:23.357 --> 05:25.626
You're the best.
You're the best.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.361
Herman Schmidberg!

05:27.395 --> 05:30.197
-For the love of jazz?
-(gasps)

05:30.230 --> 05:32.332
(dramatic musical sting)

05:32.366 --> 05:34.735
(playing off-key)

05:34.768 --> 05:36.904
I can't play! I just can't!

05:36.937 --> 05:39.740
It's in my head,
but my hands won't do it!

05:41.609 --> 05:43.143
What's with her?

05:43.176 --> 05:45.546
(dramatic musical sting)

05:45.579 --> 05:47.314
Woo-hoo! Whoa!

05:47.347 --> 05:49.249
I'm suffering from beer-tigo!

05:49.282 --> 05:51.552
Whoa! (giggles)

05:51.585 --> 05:54.087
You don't have to worry
about what's wrong with you.

05:54.121 --> 05:57.090
Just find out whatever it is,
and you can fix it.

05:57.124 --> 05:59.727
ADHD? No, that's Bart.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.095
OCD? No, that's Mom.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.498
This one's Dad.
This one's Dad.

06:04.532 --> 06:07.200
This one's Dad. This one's Dad.

06:07.234 --> 06:09.403
What is the name
when you can't perform something

06:09.437 --> 06:13.240
that you've practiced four times
a week since you were three?!

06:13.273 --> 06:16.076
MAN (over video): The yips,
named for Dr. Augustus Yip.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.911
A mysterious
psychological condition

06:17.945 --> 06:21.582
where well-rehearsed skills
suddenly become impossible.

06:21.615 --> 06:26.053
Like all mental disorders,
the yips are likely incurable.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.588
Oh, for God's sake.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.994
The yips. I have the yips!

06:35.328 --> 06:38.098
Bart, what happened
to your pupils?

06:38.131 --> 06:40.468
They're Annie'd, okay?

06:40.501 --> 06:43.036
MARGE: Lisa, you want
to play some more?

06:43.070 --> 06:44.672
No!

06:47.407 --> 06:48.776
(sighs)

06:48.809 --> 06:50.878
(Lisa crying)

06:50.911 --> 06:53.280
Lisa, honey, are you okay?

06:53.313 --> 06:56.149
You barely touched
your green disgustos.

06:56.183 --> 06:58.418
Some nights, there's isn't
enough kale in the world

06:58.452 --> 07:00.387
to brighten a girl's mood.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.323
(laughs)
Oh, that's a good one!

07:03.356 --> 07:05.459
-Don't you dare.
-Okay.

07:05.493 --> 07:06.994
I have some news.

07:07.027 --> 07:09.329
My great half step-aunt
Eunice Bouvier

07:09.362 --> 07:13.934
is turning 100 years old,
and she wants us there.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.969
Is this the aunt
who lives in Florida?

07:16.003 --> 07:19.507
It's not just Florida.
It's Gainesville!

07:19.540 --> 07:21.241
I only have two weeks vacation,

07:21.274 --> 07:23.243
and I have to spend 'em
in Dullsville?

07:23.276 --> 07:25.278
Gainesville.
If we have time,

07:25.312 --> 07:27.414
we'll take a day trip
to Dullsville.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.916
HOMER, LISA and BART:
Oh!

07:28.949 --> 07:30.984
It's my turn
to pick the vacation!

07:31.018 --> 07:32.953
Also, she loves music,

07:32.986 --> 07:35.623
so I'm sure she'd like
Lisa to play for her.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.024
Stop it!

07:37.057 --> 07:40.027
Fine.
The Simpsons are going to...

07:40.060 --> 07:41.795
Oh, I can't say it.

07:41.829 --> 07:43.597
Gainesville.

07:43.631 --> 07:47.835
* I was born
in Gainesville, Florida *

07:47.868 --> 07:51.004
* And my father *

07:51.038 --> 07:54.141
* Was a tailor *

07:54.174 --> 07:57.177
* And my mother *

07:57.210 --> 08:00.714
* Ran a cafe *

08:00.748 --> 08:05.252
* Near the university. *

08:07.220 --> 08:09.022
MALE PILOT (over P.A.):
Uh, takeoff is

08:09.056 --> 08:10.624
the most perilous phase
of air travel.

08:10.658 --> 08:12.726
If you're gonna crash,
that's when it happens.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.227
Wait. Am I on mic?

08:14.261 --> 08:15.963
FEMALE PILOT:
Yes, Frank.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.831
Uh, folks,
you were just listening

08:17.865 --> 08:20.534
to a new play I wrote--
Death at 600 Feet.

08:20.568 --> 08:21.869
Yeah.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.737
I don't think
that's making it better.

08:23.771 --> 08:26.006
Well, thank you for the note,
Scott Rudin.

08:26.039 --> 08:29.009
I'm sorry to announce
that all our TVs are out.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.410
PASSENGERS (groaning):
Oh!

08:30.443 --> 08:33.013
But you're welcome to read
our in-flight magazine,

08:33.046 --> 08:36.984
featuring an interview
with our CEO, Hanuki Atanawa.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.719
PASSENGERS (louder):
Oh!

08:38.752 --> 08:40.721
Maybe we'll have
one of those passenger riots

08:40.754 --> 08:43.591
that seem to occur every
other day on U.S. airlines.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.593
(woman grunting, panting)

08:45.626 --> 08:48.729
-Could I get another seat?
-No, absolutely not!

08:48.762 --> 08:50.764
You chose
an economy modest ticket.

08:50.798 --> 08:53.200
Please! They're both farting!

08:55.035 --> 08:56.937
All it would take
is a single spark

08:56.970 --> 08:58.939
to set this powder keg off.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.674
(passengers grunting)

09:00.708 --> 09:02.576
-(clamoring)
-(bottles clinking)

09:04.411 --> 09:06.179
PASSENGERS (chanting):
Hey, hey, TWA!

09:06.213 --> 09:08.215
How many flights
did you cancel today?!

09:08.248 --> 09:09.950
Hey, hey, TWA!

09:09.983 --> 09:12.285
MALE PILOT (over P.A.): Folks,
I'm afraid due to turbulence

09:12.319 --> 09:15.088
among the passengers, we are
gonna have to land immediately.

09:15.122 --> 09:17.625
Looks like we will not
be going to Gainesville.

09:17.658 --> 09:20.628
(passengers cheering)

09:20.661 --> 09:22.796
MALE PILOT: (chuckles)
It is pretty great, isn't it?

09:22.830 --> 09:25.532
Our new destination is,
uh... let's see.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.401
-New Orleans!
-(passengers cheering)

09:28.435 --> 09:31.471
It's a miracle! Everyone wins!

09:31.504 --> 09:33.874
(clock ticking)

09:33.907 --> 09:37.477
* Happy birthday to me *

09:37.510 --> 09:41.148
* Happy birthday
to me. *

09:46.186 --> 09:48.188
(band playing lively jazz music)

09:50.257 --> 09:53.293
Look, Lisa! Isn't that nice?

09:53.326 --> 09:56.096
The sign's telling you
to celebrate!

09:56.129 --> 09:58.098
What are you celebrating?

09:58.131 --> 10:00.300
Humidity at a 98%.

10:02.135 --> 10:03.804
Don't they sound great?

10:03.837 --> 10:06.173
Yep. More musicians
better than me.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.507
Oh, boy.

10:07.540 --> 10:10.410
You're good at cheering her up.
I'll take Bart.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.679
Whoop-de-do.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.480
HOMER:
Hmm. (chuckles)

10:13.513 --> 10:15.248
Well, I appreciate
you choosing me, Dad,

10:15.282 --> 10:17.250
but I don't know
how much fun I'll be.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.286
I think I can
cheer my princess up.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.588
-I don't think you can.
-Oh, I think I can.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.023
I'm a pretty tough nut.

10:23.056 --> 10:25.458
Well, if you're a nut,
I will crack you up.

10:25.492 --> 10:27.027
Not with puns, I'm afraid.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.161
-Yes, I can.
-No, really.

10:28.195 --> 10:29.362
-You like puns.
-No, I don't.

10:29.396 --> 10:30.664
I said cheer up!

10:30.698 --> 10:32.199
That kind of scares me.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.534
-Scary "eek" or scary "ha ha"?
-Why would you say that?

10:34.567 --> 10:35.803
There is no scary "ha ha."

10:35.836 --> 10:37.170
-Yes, there is.
-No, there isn't.

10:37.204 --> 10:40.307
-What about scary clowns?
-Nobody likes scary clowns!

10:40.340 --> 10:42.475
-Go to your room!
-I'm in New Orleans!

10:42.509 --> 10:44.244
That's your answer
to everything!

10:48.716 --> 10:51.885
HOMER: Did you know that a man
can fall in love with a city?

10:51.919 --> 10:53.954
It happens slowly at first.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.555
Then when you develop a crush,

10:55.588 --> 10:58.692
you find your love
just grows and grows.

10:58.726 --> 11:01.228
If you like, you can take
that drink on the street.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.430
(gasps) Even Bourbon Street?

11:04.431 --> 11:05.632
(lively jazz music playing)

11:05.665 --> 11:07.167
(gasps)

11:11.438 --> 11:14.241
Oh, I'm out.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.576
Enjoy.

11:16.609 --> 11:19.479
HOMER: And then you discover
a thousand little things

Okay, sweetie, Daddy's in love.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.936
So now we'll deal
with your sadness.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.771
Okay. It's good
to see you happy, Dad.

12:51.805 --> 12:53.673
(retches)
Hold that thought.

Uh, my good boy,
is there a vomitorium?

13:19.332 --> 13:22.035
Which of those words
do you think appeals to me?

13:22.069 --> 13:25.472
Okay. We could talk
about your hat.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.707
It has a lot of history, too.

13:27.740 --> 13:30.677
-Did you know that it...
-(groans)

13:30.710 --> 13:33.680
All right, wise guy.
Here's something you'll like.

13:33.713 --> 13:35.715
Cool. I always read better

13:35.748 --> 13:37.684
when the letters
are dripping like blood.

13:37.717 --> 13:40.553
Bart, you go in there,
and I'll pray for you in here.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.659
Please, Lord, please.

13:46.693 --> 13:48.728
I need to finish this, okay?

13:48.761 --> 13:50.763
All day, you had.

13:52.599 --> 13:55.502
Please, Lord.
We're a family on a budget.

13:55.535 --> 13:59.739
We just need a little relief
from our demons, please.

14:02.442 --> 14:03.543
Hmm.

14:03.576 --> 14:05.045
Where are we?

14:05.078 --> 14:06.413
I smell Pringles.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.882
(groans) You'll pay.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.250
You'll all pay!

14:10.283 --> 14:12.852
-Mom, will you pay for this?
-(groans): Oh.

14:12.886 --> 14:15.722
Now, sweetie,
let's find a restaurant for you.

14:15.755 --> 14:18.025
I don't think
my problem can be solved

14:18.058 --> 14:20.227
by crawfish and jambalaya.

14:20.260 --> 14:24.097
I wonder, do they have jazz
in New Orleans?

14:26.699 --> 14:29.669
Okay, Lisa,
look at your hero for an hour.

14:29.702 --> 14:32.272
I'm gonna take a whiz
in the cemetery next door.

14:32.305 --> 14:33.606
(hums a tune)

14:33.640 --> 14:37.177
Okay, who to choose?
Who to choose?

14:37.210 --> 14:40.613
Ooh, Etienne de Boré.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.382
I wish you could talk.

14:43.416 --> 14:45.385
(grunts excitedly)

14:45.418 --> 14:48.421
Man, I have been waiting
for someone to make that wish.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.057
What's on your mind?

14:50.090 --> 14:51.624
My music teacher says

14:51.658 --> 14:54.061
there'll always be
someone better than me.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.196
(chuckles):
Well, that's not the only way

14:56.229 --> 14:58.231
to be part of jazz.

14:58.265 --> 15:01.969
Well, I could be a jazz critic
or a music executive.

15:02.002 --> 15:04.371
Jazz critic? Music executive?

15:04.404 --> 15:07.107
They're nothing
but glorified grave robbers.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.442
Look what I found
in one of the graves.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.979
-Put that back!
-(Homer groans)

15:12.012 --> 15:14.081
Lisa, darling,
you just keep searching.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.984
You can find anything you want
in New Orleans.

15:17.017 --> 15:20.753
Except, apparently,
statue polish and pigeon poison.

15:20.787 --> 15:25.092
Thank you. And may I ask you,
how are things in heaven?

15:25.125 --> 15:27.760
You know that thing
we used to call reefer

15:27.794 --> 15:29.829
and you people
now call medicine?

15:29.862 --> 15:31.164
I do.

15:31.198 --> 15:34.734
Well, they have it up in heaven,
and it is mighty fine.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.469
Mighty fine!

15:36.503 --> 15:38.338
(laughs)

15:38.371 --> 15:40.107
So, any last advice?

15:40.140 --> 15:42.309
Your father knows best.

15:42.342 --> 15:43.810
Let's go to a bar.

15:43.843 --> 15:45.145
-But...
-Daddy's right.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.579
Can I sing you out?

15:46.613 --> 15:49.416
Anything but
"What a Wonderful World" please.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.318
Can you sing
"What a Wonderful World"?

15:51.351 --> 15:53.353
What a horrible world.

15:59.026 --> 16:01.028
("When the Saints
Go Marching In" playing)

16:11.204 --> 16:13.773
HOMER: Okay, I moved her
from crying to glum.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.375
Now to shoot for happy.

16:15.408 --> 16:17.844
I just pray they don't
see through her fake ID.

16:17.877 --> 16:19.846
MAN:
Hmm.

16:19.879 --> 16:21.381
Well, it's better than his.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.250
Uh-huh.

16:24.351 --> 16:25.985
(Bart laughs)

16:30.823 --> 16:32.792
Milhouse, anything yet?

16:32.825 --> 16:34.227
No effect.

16:34.261 --> 16:37.030
But how's Lisa dealing
with her depression?

16:37.064 --> 16:39.532
Oh, give up on Lisa.
Wait for Maggie.

16:39.566 --> 16:40.967
Oh, I don't...

16:41.000 --> 16:43.070
Wait! Maggie likes me?

16:44.437 --> 16:46.673
Still not working.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.341
What's not working?

16:48.375 --> 16:51.411
Uh, Bart's got voodoo dolls
of all you guys.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.813
(scoffs) There's no voodoo
in Gainesville.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.015
Their flight got diverted
to New Orleans.

16:56.049 --> 16:57.584
(all whimper)

16:57.617 --> 17:01.088
(grunts)
You hackeyed the wrong sack!

17:01.121 --> 17:03.090
(all grunting)

17:03.123 --> 17:04.757
It's working!

17:04.791 --> 17:07.194
So, has Maggie said
anything about me?

17:07.227 --> 17:10.697
We have a lot in common.
Same bedtime.

17:10.730 --> 17:13.200
We both like clapping.

17:15.068 --> 17:16.536
Ow! Ow! Ow!

17:16.569 --> 17:18.571
Come on, we've got to go
meet your father.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.107
Let's go.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.909
Well, there's no miracle
for me here.

17:22.942 --> 17:25.245
(cries) Why?

17:25.278 --> 17:28.081
Don't worry, sweetie.
No one can see you.

17:28.115 --> 17:31.050
You're alone in the dark,
anonymous.

17:31.084 --> 17:33.086
-Spotlight?!
-What?!

17:33.120 --> 17:36.956
Lisa, would you do us the honor
of joining us onstage?

17:36.989 --> 17:39.959
How do you know me?

17:41.494 --> 17:43.730
That man is my uncle.

17:43.763 --> 17:46.032
(gasps)
Bleeding Gums Murphy?

17:46.065 --> 17:48.935
-We called him Oscar.
-Oscar! Oh.

17:48.968 --> 17:50.403
Oscar Gums Murphy.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.372
You still play bari sax?

17:52.405 --> 17:55.108
I wish I could play for you,
Bleeding Gums' nephew,

17:55.142 --> 17:56.943
but I have the yips.

17:56.976 --> 17:58.545
Oh, that's too bad.

17:58.578 --> 18:01.314
Well, could you hold this
while I play clarinet?

18:01.348 --> 18:04.050
Now, could you give
the mouthpiece a little kiss?

18:04.083 --> 18:06.486
I think I see through
your simple plan.

18:06.519 --> 18:09.622
My uncle said you were the most
promising young musician

18:09.656 --> 18:11.924
-he'd ever met.
-He did?

18:11.958 --> 18:13.993
(scoffs) It was kind of
an insult to me,

18:14.026 --> 18:15.895
but he was
pretty passive-aggressive.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.497
So, are you gonna play?

18:19.031 --> 18:20.833
Yes! I want to jam!

18:20.867 --> 18:22.935
I want to scat! I want to riff!

18:22.969 --> 18:25.272
I want to get down! Oh!

18:25.305 --> 18:27.974
(playing lively jazz music)

18:33.980 --> 18:37.083
(crowd cheering)

18:37.116 --> 18:40.353
She's playing.
You did it, Homie!

18:40.387 --> 18:42.855
Marge, I just realized,
we've helped everyone else,

18:42.889 --> 18:45.458
but we haven't done
anything for you.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.527
A mother's happy as long as

18:47.560 --> 18:49.896
all her children are happy.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.633
Another one, sir?

18:53.666 --> 18:55.802
No, that's not my... Uh, yeah.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.837
Uh, this one straight up.

19:02.074 --> 19:04.143
Aw.

19:09.048 --> 19:11.718
(saxophone playing jazz music)

19:11.751 --> 19:14.221
HOMER:
Lisa, knock off that racket!

19:14.254 --> 19:16.423
LISA:
Oh, how I've missed this.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.727
(gasps)
Mr. Armstrong!

19:20.760 --> 19:24.063
-Why does a ghost sweat?
-I don't know.

19:24.096 --> 19:27.133
But I would give anything
for a new shirt.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.469
(both laugh)

19:29.502 --> 19:32.739
I'd also really like
to be alive again.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.674
(laughs)

19:34.707 --> 19:36.709
(sighs)

19:42.515 --> 19:46.052
The beignet eliminates
the only flaw of the donut:

19:46.085 --> 19:48.488
there is no hole.

19:48.521 --> 19:49.789

19:57.964 --> 19:59.866
(fireworks whistling, popping)

19:59.899 --> 20:01.868
(sighs)
Well, we did it, kids.

20:01.901 --> 20:03.370
And the best thing is,

20:03.403 --> 20:06.205
the next episode
will beat Gunsmoke.

20:06.239 --> 20:09.376
What about all the episodes
they made on radio?

20:09.409 --> 20:10.843
-Have a beignet.
-(grunts)

20:10.877 --> 20:13.646

20:59.091 --> 21:01.093
Shh!
