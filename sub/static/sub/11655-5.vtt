AKU: Long ago,
in a distant land,

00:04.589 --> 00:09.219
I, Aku, the shape-shifting
master of darkness,

00:09.344 --> 00:12.847
unleashed an unspeakable evil.

00:12.931 --> 00:18.478
But a foolish samurai warrior
wielding a magic sword

00:18.561 --> 00:21.606
stepped forth to oppose me.

was struck,

00:26.611 --> 00:29.239
I tore open a portal in time

00:29.322 --> 00:34.035
and flung him into the future,
where my evil is law.

00:34.160 --> 00:38.289
Now, the fool seeks to return
to the past

00:38.373 --> 00:43.211
and undo the future that is Aku.

to find that out.

04:35.401 --> 04:37.862
It looks like some kind of tomb,

04:38.029 --> 04:39.530
and there's a story on it.

04:39.822 --> 04:44.035
It says that long ago,
the evil overlord, Set,

04:44.118 --> 04:47.830
came and unleashed
his evil minions upon the land.

04:48.122 --> 04:51.334
None of the great pharaohs' armies
could stop the minions

04:52.168 --> 04:54.545
as they brought terror to all.

04:55.171 --> 04:58.007
The pharaoh then called upon a great power

04:58.090 --> 05:02.303
to imprison the minions here,
in this tomb,

05:02.386 --> 05:04.597
where they will stay forever.

05:09.352 --> 05:12.271
were ever to be freed of their prison,

the only salvation would be to--
