Hoo, mama!
What a twist!

10:02.502 --> 10:04.638
It is cheese central
up in here.

Come, come!
Your record deal.

And your prize money.
You deserve it.

10:10.543 --> 10:12.846
Hey. Wait a sec.
I just have one question, Dad.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.582
How'd you even know I'd be
here in the first place?

10:15.615 --> 10:17.785
Well, that's the weird thing --
I got an odd call from

10:17.818 --> 10:20.921
what sounded like very small
children telling me to come here.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.623
He was really hard to find
in the phone book,

10:23.657 --> 10:25.625

10:25.659 --> 10:27.961
Little dudes, thank you
for everything you've done.

10:27.995 --> 10:31.098
Oh, right. And here's
your share of the dough.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.666
Oh, fat stacks!

you down to the studio.

-Wow, that's a good fist.
-More popcorn for you, sir?

Just leave it here. Thanks.
And here's a tip for you.
