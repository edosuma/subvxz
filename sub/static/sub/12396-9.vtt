WEBVTT

00:05.800 --> 00:07.563
- PREVIOUSLY ON PSYCH...

00:07.670 --> 00:09.399
- I THINK IT'S TIME
THAT WE MOVED IN TOGETHER.

00:09.510 --> 00:12.001
HOME SHOULD BE
WHEREVER YOU ARE.

00:12.110 --> 00:13.737
SAY CHEESE OR SOMETHING.
- OH. CHEESE OR SOMETHING.

00:13.840 --> 00:17.207
SHAWN, I NEED TO ASK YOU
SOMETHING.

00:17.310 --> 00:20.518
LASSITER SAID
YOU HAD A VISION.

00:20.620 --> 00:23.339
- I'M GOOD AT WHAT I DO.

00:23.450 --> 00:24.712
- ARE YOU TELLING ME
THIS IS ALL A LIE?

00:24.820 --> 00:28.051
- PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME
ANSWER THAT.

00:28.160 --> 00:31.027
I THINK MAYBE YOU'RE MAKING
TOO MUCH OF THIS.

00:31.130 --> 00:32.552
- HONESTY IS EVERYTHING
TO ME, SHAWN.

00:32.660 --> 00:34.628
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL ANYONE
ABOUT THIS...

00:34.730 --> 00:37.221
- DON'T WORRY.

00:37.330 --> 00:39.093
- SWEETHEART, I AM SO SORRY--
- I KNOW YOU DON'T THINK

00:39.200 --> 00:40.064
IT'S A BIG DEAL,
BUT THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT,

00:40.170 --> 00:41.637
THE ANGRIER I GET.

00:41.740 --> 00:43.037
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,
EXACTLY?

00:43.140 --> 00:46.075
- I THINK
YOU SHOULD MOVE OUT.

00:56.150 --> 00:58.380
SEAN...
- [clears throat]

00:58.490 --> 01:00.481
- YOU'VE BEEN PACKING
THAT SAME BOX FOR THE LAST HOUR.

01:00.590 --> 01:01.784
- WELL, I--

01:01.820 --> 01:02.184
OH, HEY, WAIT,
YOU CAN'T TH ROW THAT OUT.

01:03.930 --> 01:05.579
I GOT YOU THAT SHIRT
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY.

01:05.690 --> 01:08.523
- YEAH, IT'S, UH--
IT'S NOT REALLY MY THING.

01:08.630 --> 01:11.121
- JULES,
I SPENT SOME SERIOUS TIME,

01:11.230 --> 01:14.097
A TIRELESS SEARCH LOOKING FOR
SOMETHING THAT EXUDED STYLE.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.407
SOMETHING THAT
SAID "FASHION!"

01:16.510 --> 01:19.832
- WELL,
IT'S A BIT LITERAL,

01:19.940 --> 01:22.079
BUT I'M--
I'M HAPPY TO KEEP IT...

01:22.180 --> 01:23.147
- I MEAN IF YOU--
IF YOU WANT--

01:23.250 --> 01:25.070
- BURIED IN A DRAWER.

01:25.180 --> 01:26.772
- UH, HEY, WE, UH--

01:26.820 --> 01:27.172
WE STILL HAVEN'T DIWIED UP
THOSE CEREAL BOXES.

01:29.750 --> 01:31.786
- SHAWN,
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

01:31.820 --> 01:32.184
AND PROLONGING THIS
IS ONLY GONNA

01:33.420 --> 01:34.455
MAKE IT HARDER
FOR BOTH OF US.

01:34.560 --> 01:36.585
- OKAY, I PROPOSE

01:36.690 --> 01:38.578
JOINT CUSTODY
ON THE FROOT LOOPS

01:38.690 --> 01:39.793
AND THAT I DON'T MOVE OUT.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.299
- SHAWN, COME ON.

01:41.400 --> 01:42.765
THIS ISN'T EASY
FOR ME EITHER.

01:42.870 --> 01:43.859
IT WASN'T MY CHOICE
TO BLOW THIS.

01:43.970 --> 01:45.289
- ALL RIGHT,
YOU KNOW WHAT, JULES?

01:45.400 --> 01:46.560
FIRST OF ALL,
THERE ARE A LOT OF GUYS

01:46.670 --> 01:48.729
THAT BLEW IT
WAY WORSE THAN I DID

01:48.840 --> 01:51.400
AND GOT TO KEEP THEIR WOMEN,
LIKE BILL CLINTON.

01:51.510 --> 01:53.205
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND,
EVEN MARIA SHRIVER

01:53.310 --> 01:56.143
IS STARTING TO THAW A LI'I'I'LE.
[knock on door]

01:56.250 --> 01:57.603
HEY, IF THAT'S--

01:57.710 --> 02:00.645
IF THAT'S, UH, A CAMERA CREW
AND A MAKEOVER TEAM,

02:00.750 --> 02:03.287
TECHNICALLY,
I STILL LIVE HERE. PLEASE.

02:03.390 --> 02:05.119
- SHAWN, IT'S THE GIRL
I'M INTERVIEWING

02:05.220 --> 02:06.380
TO BE MY NEW ROOMMATE.

02:06.490 --> 02:09.118
- WHAT--
- HER NAME IS KIMBERLY.

02:09.230 --> 02:10.652
- YOU ARE KICKING ME OUT

02:10.760 --> 02:12.455
AND REPLACING ME
ON THE SAME DAY?

02:12.560 --> 02:13.822
- SHE ANSWERED MY AD
ON CRAIGSLIST.

02:13.930 --> 02:16.819
- JULES, ONLY PSYCHOS
ANSWER ADS ON CRAIGSLIST.

02:16.930 --> 02:19.125
YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE POSTED IT
ON MURDERMETHISINSTANT.COM

02:19.240 --> 02:21.663
- HI.
- HI.

02:21.770 --> 02:22.668
- SO NICE TO MEET YOU.
- HI. KIMBERLY.

02:22.770 --> 02:23.907
- COME ON IN.
- HI.

02:24.010 --> 02:26.205
WOW.
- ALL RIGHT, KIM, POP QUIZ.

02:26.310 --> 02:27.868
[deep voice]
WHERE DOES THE LOTION GO?

02:27.980 --> 02:31.848
- UH...KIMBERLY,
THIS IS MY, UH, FUNNY

02:31.950 --> 02:34.714
AND SLIGHTLY INAPPROPRIATE
FRIEND, SHAWN,

02:34.820 --> 02:38.312
AND HE WAS JUST LEAVING.

02:38.420 --> 02:39.819
- YOU KNOW,
THE PHOTOS IN THE AD

02:39.920 --> 02:41.456
DO NOT DO
THIS PLACE JUSTICE.

02:41.560 --> 02:44.654
- AWW.
- IT'S AMAZING.

02:44.760 --> 02:46.853
- SERIOUSLY, KIM,
WHERE DOES IT GO?

02:46.960 --> 02:48.791
WHERE DOES THE LOTION GO?
- DON'T ANSWER THAT.

02:48.900 --> 02:50.891
- WHERE DO YOU
PUT THE LOTION?

02:51.000 --> 02:52.194
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER
ANY QUESTIONS THAT--

02:53.100 --> 02:53.930
ESPECIALLY ANY QUESTIONS
ABOUT LOTION.

02:54.740 --> 02:55.297
- DID YOU TELL HER
ABOUT THE BATS?

02:56.040 --> 02:57.302
PLACE IS INFESTED
WITH BATS.

02:58.270 --> 02:59.168
HOW ABOUT KATHY?
YOU TELL HER ABOUT KATHY?

02:59.840 --> 03:02.308
- WHO'S KATHY?
- WHO'S KATHY?

03:02.410 --> 03:03.707
JUST THE GHOST
WHO LIVES HERE.

03:03.810 --> 03:04.947
YOU KNOW, SHE BLEEDS
THROUGH THE WALLS

03:05.050 --> 03:06.870
ON OCCASION,
AND SHE LIKES TO CUDDLE

03:06.980 --> 03:08.447
ON THE DAY SHE WAS MURDERED.

03:08.550 --> 03:10.347
I GUESS IT'S ALL
PRETTY HARMLESS STUFF

03:10.450 --> 03:11.712
AS LONG AS YOUR SOUL
IS PURE.

03:11.820 --> 03:13.412
- [laughs]

03:13.520 --> 03:14.782
SEE, I TOLD YOU.

03:14.890 --> 03:17.529
I MEAN, HE'S SO SILLY.

03:17.630 --> 03:19.757
AND YOU ARE LEAVING,
RIGHT NOW?

03:19.860 --> 03:21.794
- ACTUALLY,
I DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE TO BE.

03:21.900 --> 03:23.629
- [sighs]

03:23.730 --> 03:25.925
- MY CURRENT ROOMMATE
IS APARTMENT HUNTING TOO

03:26.030 --> 03:28.794
AND I'M REALLY HOPING
SHE DOESN'T SEE THIS LISTING.

03:28.900 --> 03:30.208
IS THAT HORRIBLE OF ME
TO SAY?

03:30.310 --> 03:31.937
- YES. 100%.
KATHY AGREES.

03:32.040 --> 03:34.201
- OKAY. OKAY.
LET'S GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED.

03:34.310 --> 03:35.208
YEAH.
- OKAY.

03:35.310 --> 03:39.872
- HAVE A SEAT.

03:39.980 --> 03:43.916
- I'M NOT JUST GONNA GIVE UP
ON US, ALL RIGHT?

03:50.060 --> 03:54.292
- HI.
- OKAY. UH...

03:54.400 --> 03:55.549
- COME ON, MAN.

03:55.660 --> 03:56.888
JUST LET ME STAY WITH YOU.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.922
BE LIKE OLD TIMES, YOU KNOW?

03:59.030 --> 04:01.828
PUT SOMEBODY'S FINGER IN WARM
WATER WHILE THEY'RE SLEEPING

04:01.940 --> 04:03.805
OR RUB TOOTHPASTE
ALL OVER THEIR ARMS.

04:03.840 --> 04:03.999
- FIRST OF ALL, SHAWN, WE'RE NOT
IN OUR LATE 20$ ANYMORE.

04:06.540 --> 04:08.929
AND SECONDLY, AS MUCH
AS MY HEART GOES OUT TO YOU,

04:09.040 --> 04:10.007
RACHAEL AND MAX
ARE STAYING WITH ME

04:10.110 --> 04:11.702
UNTIL THE HOUSE
GETS FUMIGATED.

04:11.810 --> 04:13.368
- OH, SO YOU JUST GET TO PLAY
PRETEND FAMILY

04:13.480 --> 04:14.777
WITH AN INDIAN PRINCESS

04:14.880 --> 04:16.484
WHILE I'M STUCK
LIVING ON THE STREETS

04:16.590 --> 04:18.387
LIKE JAMIE FOXX
WITH AN OLD CELLO?

04:18.490 --> 04:19.855
- YES.
- HEY.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.882
- HEY, DAD,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

04:21.990 --> 04:23.821
- OH, JUST DONATING SOME STUFF
TO THE POLICE LEAGUE AUCTION.

04:23.860 --> 04:24.019
WHAT'S GOING ON?
- SHAWN NEEDS A PLACE TO STAY.

04:25.790 --> 04:27.826
- WELL, YOU KNOW
MY DOOR'S ALWAYS OPEN.

04:27.860 --> 04:28.019
- EXACTLY,
WHICH IS WHY I'M NEVER

04:29.060 --> 04:30.891
SETTING FOOT IN THERE AGAIN,

04:31.000 --> 04:33.298
EVER SINCE I SAW YOU AND MY
POOR, UNSUSPECTING MOTHER--

04:33.400 --> 04:34.992
- MAKING LOVE?
- UGH!

04:35.100 --> 04:37.466
I DIED 10% INSIDE.

04:37.570 --> 04:38.798
OKAY? I'M SERIOUS.

04:38.840 --> 04:38.999
I CAN'T FEEL
MY ARMPITS ANYMORE.

04:40.880 --> 04:41.972
JUST LOOK AT THIS.
DO YOU SEE THIS?

04:42.080 --> 04:43.274
ARE YOU SEEING THIS?

04:43.380 --> 04:44.904
I USED TO BE TICKLISH
UNDER THERE.

04:45.010 --> 04:48.548
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.

04:48.650 --> 04:52.313
[chuckles]
- WHAT'S THIS?

04:52.420 --> 04:56.322
"ROOMMATE NEEDED AT PALATIAL
BEACHFRONT PROPERTY."

04:56.430 --> 04:57.954
- WHAT?
WITH UNBELIEVABLY LOW RENT.

04:58.060 --> 05:01.052
- WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- WOW.

05:03.030 --> 05:05.863
[cell phone rings]
- YOU GOT THE WOOD-MAN.

05:05.970 --> 05:07.938
- WOODY?

05:08.040 --> 05:09.928
HANG UP RIGHT NOW, SHAWN.
HANG UP RIGHT NOW.

05:10.040 --> 05:11.928
- UH, HEY, BUDDY.

05:12.040 --> 05:13.803
- LOOKING FOR A ROOMMATE I HEAR.
- DON'T DO IT.

05:13.840 --> 05:13.999
- DON'T LIE TO ME NOW.
IS THIS REALLY WATERFRONT?

05:15.980 --> 05:17.504
- OH, YEAH.

05:17.610 --> 05:19.840
OH, IT'S--IT'S GORGEOUS.

05:19.950 --> 05:21.417
I GOT A 20,000 SQUARE FOOT
BACKYARD...

05:21.520 --> 05:24.080
- 20,000 SQUARE FEET.
- I DON'T CARE.

05:24.190 --> 05:25.088
- IT'S LIKE AN EPISODE
OF BAYWATCH.

05:25.190 --> 05:26.350
- THAT SOUNDS BEAUTIFUL

05:26.460 --> 05:27.688
AND EXACTLY WHAT I NEED.

05:27.790 --> 05:28.814
- NO, IT'S NOT.
- COUNT ME IN.

05:28.860 --> 05:29.019
I'LL SEE YOU IN PARADISE,
BUDDY.

05:30.730 --> 05:32.789
- YOU GOT IT.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.891

06:15.040 --> 06:17.361

06:17.470 --> 06:20.530

IF YOU START BA'I'I'ING

SO WHAT'S THE PLAN?

_ THE PLAN IS TO WIN JULES BACK,
OBVIOUSLY.

06:37.190 --> 06:39.420
- GOOD LUCK, SHAWN.

06:39.530 --> 06:41.122

IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

06:41.230 --> 06:42.959

08:00.640 --> 08:02.073
I CALL IT "THE SN-OAFER."

08:02.180 --> 08:03.477

08:03.580 --> 08:04.877
- YEAH,
BUSINESS ON THE LEFT,

08:04.980 --> 08:06.572
PARTY ON THE RIGHT.

- NO, I NEED YOU.
LET ME STAY IN THE HOUSE.

08:34.880 --> 08:35.938
LET ME STAY
IN RACHAEL'S HOUSE,

08:36.040 --> 08:37.905
UH, IN THE FUMIGATION TENT.

08:38.010 --> 08:39.102
- DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, SHAWN.
- I'M NOT BEING RIDICULOUS.

08:39.210 --> 08:40.518
YOU HEARD WHAT HE S--
- NOW.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.611
AS FOR THIS ONE,
CAUSE OF DEATH

08:42.720 --> 08:45.917
WAS ACUTE BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA
TO THE HEAD.

08:46.020 --> 08:47.658
- THE LACK OF BLOOD
AT THE CRIME SCENE

08:47.760 --> 08:49.113
WOULD INDICATE
THAT SHE WAS MURDERED ELSEWHERE

08:49.220 --> 08:50.881
AND THEN MOVED,
WHICH WOULD ALSO EXPLAIN

08:50.990 --> 08:54.619
WHY SHE HAD NO ID ON HER.

08:54.730 --> 08:56.595
- HEY THERE, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE TAKING A PERSONAL DAY.

08:56.700 --> 08:58.588
- WELL, THIS WAS
A POTENTIAL ROOMMATE OF MINE,

08:58.700 --> 09:00.930
SO I THOUGHT I'D COME DOWN
AND HELP ANY WAY I CAN.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.201
- A NAME WOULD BE GREAT.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.959
- KIMBERLY.

09:05.070 --> 09:08.278
- DID YOU GET A LAST NAME?
- NO, I DIDN'T.

09:08.380 --> 09:09.870
- WELL THAT'S SOME
PRETTY SERIOUS

09:09.980 --> 09:11.277
HERMAN CAIN-STYLE
VETTING THERE, JULES.

09:11.380 --> 09:12.870
- IT WAS A QUICK MEET
TO SEE IF WE CLICKED.

09:12.920 --> 09:13.079
I WAS GONNA
CHECK HER BACKGROUND

09:14.280 --> 09:15.747
AFTER SHE BROUGHT BACK
THE APPLICATION.

09:15.850 --> 09:17.010
- DID YOU AT LEAST
GET A PHONE NUMBER?

09:17.120 --> 09:18.678
- NO, UH,
JUST AN EMAIL ADDRESS,

09:18.790 --> 09:19.984
BUT IT WAS A DEAD END.

09:20.090 --> 09:21.682
- WHAT CAN YOU GIVE US?

09:21.790 --> 09:24.953
- WELL, SHE WAS ALLERGIC
TO CATS, SHE LIKED BLUEGRASS--

09:25.060 --> 09:26.618
- WHOA, SHE LIKED BLUEGRASS?

09:26.730 --> 09:28.857
I THINK WE CAN PROBABLY
JUST FOREGO THE DNA TESTING.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.791
DON'T YOU GUYS?

09:30.900 --> 09:32.697
COME ON, JULES, I GET IT.

09:32.800 --> 09:36.031
YOU'RE FEELING RECKLESS,
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT CRAZY.

09:36.140 --> 09:37.903
BUT DON'T YOU THINK
IT WOULD BE NICE

09:38.010 --> 09:40.308
IF THERE WAS SOMEONE
HANGING AROUND THE HOUSE

09:40.410 --> 09:42.207
WHO COULD REMIND YOU TO BE
A LITTLE MORE CAUTIOUS?

09:42.310 --> 09:44.642
MAYBE SOMEONE MAN-LIKE

09:44.750 --> 09:49.039
WITH KIND HAIR
AND SOFT, FULL LIPS?

09:49.150 --> 09:50.879
- I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN
FOR MY WELL-BEING,

09:50.990 --> 09:53.584
BUT I CAN TAKE CARE
OF MYSELF.

09:53.690 --> 09:55.180
THOUGH I SHOULD DO
A BETTER JOB

09:55.290 --> 09:59.226
OF FIGURING OUT
WHO PEOPLE REALLY ARE.

10:02.030 --> 10:05.022
LET ME KNOW WHAT I CAN DO.

10:11.070 --> 10:15.074
- YOU CAN TAKE CARE
OF ME, SHAWN.

10:17.980 --> 10:21.040
- LOOK AT THIS SPACE.
IT'S ENORMOUS.

10:21.150 --> 10:23.846
- OH, THANK YOU.
THAT'S SO SWEET.

10:23.950 --> 10:26.145
BY THE WAY,
I LOVE THAT LOCKET.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.218
IT'S LIKE SOMETHING
OUT OF AN EMILY BRONTE NOVEL.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.823
- THANKS, IT WAS
MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER'S.

10:30.930 --> 10:32.989
- AW.

10:33.100 --> 10:37.025
- THIS IS, UH,
THIS IS ME AND MY MOM.

10:37.130 --> 10:38.893
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER
IN A REALLY LONG TIME,

10:38.930 --> 10:39.089
SO THIS IS HOW
I KEEP HER CLOSE.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.870
I'M SORRY,
I-I'M SUCH A CRIER.

10:45.970 --> 10:47.198
- NO, NO, IT'S FINE.

10:47.310 --> 10:49.301
I'VE BEEN DOING MY SHARE
OF THAT LATELY AS WELL.

10:49.410 --> 10:51.139
- HEY, WE SHOULD
GO TO CHILLERZ TONIGHT,

10:51.250 --> 10:53.673
YOU KNOW, BE EACH OTHER'S
WINGWOMAN IF THE MOOD STRIKES.

10:53.780 --> 10:55.111
- I WOULD LOVE TO DO THAT,

10:55.220 --> 10:57.188
BUT I JUST GOT OUT OF
A COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP,

10:57.290 --> 10:58.746
SO I'M NOT REALLY
INTO MEETING PEOPLE.

10:58.850 --> 11:01.785
- I WAS IN A SERIOUS
RELATIONSHIP ONCE,

11:01.890 --> 11:03.949
AND IT WAS A NIGHTMARE.

11:04.060 --> 11:05.880
SO WHAT HAPPENED
WITH YOUR GUY?

11:05.990 --> 11:09.790
- LET'S JUST SAY SHAWN
HAD SOME ISSUES WITH THE TRUTH.

11:09.900 --> 11:10.821
[door closes]
- HEY, LADIES.

11:10.930 --> 11:12.397
- [gaSPSJ
OH, MY GOD.

11:12.500 --> 11:15.799
UH, SHAWN, YOU CAN'T
JUST SHOW UP HERE UNANNOUNCED.

11:15.900 --> 11:17.959
- I THOUGHT I HAD VISITATION
RIGHTS WITH MY FROOT LOOPS.

11:18.070 --> 11:22.200
I MEAN, OUR FROOT LOOPS.
LOOK AT 'EM.

11:22.310 --> 11:23.299
THEY GROW UP SO FAST.

11:23.410 --> 11:25.401
- WAIT, THAT'S YOUR EX?

11:25.510 --> 11:26.477
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK I WILL HAVE A DRINK

11:26.510 --> 11:27.078
WITH YOU TONIGHT. MM-HMM.
AT CHILLERZ. YEP.

11:29.150 --> 11:30.048
- CHILLERZ?
YOU KNOW THAT PLACE

11:30.890 --> 11:31.914
ENDS WITH A "Z,"
NOT AN "S", RIGHT?

11:32.990 --> 11:34.082
I'VE ALSO HEARD THAT
THEY MAKE THEIR POTATO SKINS

11:34.190 --> 11:35.748
WITH HUMAN SKIN.

11:35.860 --> 11:37.452
- EW.
- HMM.

11:37.560 --> 11:39.892
- YOU MUS'||_'|IBE LAURA.

11:39.930 --> 11:40.089
IT IS SO NICE TO MEET YOU.
- LIKEWISE.

11:45.170 --> 11:49.129
UH, I'M SENSING YOU USED
TO BE A HIPSTER OR A HIPPIE,

11:49.240 --> 11:50.901
OR MAYBE A LITTLE BIT
OF BOTH.

11:51.010 --> 11:52.830
- THAT IS SO AWESOME
THAT YOU KNOW THAT.

11:52.940 --> 11:56.034
- YEAH, SHAWN, I MEAN, IT'S LIKE
YOU'RE PSYCHIC OR SOMETHING.

11:56.140 --> 12:00.349
- OR SOMETHING.

12:00.450 --> 12:02.111
- WELL I HAVE A TON
OF ERRANDS SO, J,

12:02.220 --> 12:04.745
I WILL SEE YOU TONIGHT
AT CHILLERZ.

12:04.850 --> 12:06.989
BYE.

12:07.090 --> 12:08.489
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I GET TO LIVE HERE.

12:08.590 --> 12:10.319
EVEN I'M JEALOUS OF ME.

12:10.430 --> 12:13.092
- [forced laugh]
BYE-BYE.

12:13.200 --> 12:17.068
"EVEN I'M JEALOUS OF ME"?
SCHIZOID.

12:17.170 --> 12:20.731
NICE 'TUDE. CLEARLY,
SHE'S NOT GONNA WORK OUT.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.432
- LAURA IS GREAT
AND YOU KNOW IT.

12:22.540 --> 12:24.963
YOU JUST CAME BY HERE TO FIND
SOMETHING WRONG WITH HER AND--

12:25.070 --> 12:27.277
OH, MY GOD, WE MUST TALK
ABOUT BOUNDARIES.

12:27.380 --> 12:30.907
- JULES, I'M HERE TO TALK
ABOUT THE CASE--SCOUT'S HONOR.

12:31.010 --> 12:34.810
THE BLUEGRASS LEAD HASN'T
QUITE BEARED AS MUCH FRUIT

12:34.920 --> 12:36.114
AS I HAD HOPED,
SO CAN YOU REMEMBER

12:36.220 --> 12:37.380
HER SAYING ANYTHING ELSE?

12:37.490 --> 12:39.014
- YES, THAT SHE LIKED
BIKRAM YOGA

12:39.120 --> 12:40.758
AND I'M HAVING
LASSITER CHECK IT.

12:40.860 --> 12:42.384
- [gaSPSJ
HOW DARE YOU BE SITTING

12:42.490 --> 12:44.026
ON SUCH AN IMPORTANT PIECE
OF INFORMATION.

12:44.130 --> 12:45.529
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

12:45.630 --> 12:47.450
YOU GONNA GO VISIT
EVERY YOGA STUDIO IN TOWN?

12:47.560 --> 12:51.496
- NO, BECAUSE
THERE'S ONLY ONE.

12:55.940 --> 12:58.067
- WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF JULIA'S ROOMMATE?

12:58.170 --> 12:59.137
- I THINK SHE'S WEIRD.

13:00.010 --> 13:01.079
I ALSO THINK
SHE HAS THE HOTS FOR ME.

13:02.110 --> 13:02.872
- YOU DO REALIZE YOU'RE
THE LAST PERSON ON EARTH

13:04.050 --> 13:05.540
WHO SAYS "THE HOTS" WITH
ZERO IRONY IN YOUR VOICE, RIGHT?

13:05.650 --> 13:07.811
- OKAY, FINE, SHE HAS
THE HUBBA-HUBBAS FOR ME.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.376
- ALL RIGHT,
CLASS IS STARTING EVERYBODY.

13:09.480 --> 13:11.812
PLEASE PUT YOUR STUFF
INTO YOUR LOCKERS.

13:11.920 --> 13:13.387
- EXCUSE US,
WE'D LIKE TO ASK YOU

13:13.490 --> 13:15.185
A FEW QUESTIONS
ABOUT ONE OF YOUR STUDENTS.

13:15.290 --> 13:17.429
- I'M ABOUT TO TEACH CLASS.
- HOW ABOUT AFTER?

13:17.530 --> 13:19.384
- I'VE GOT BACK-TO-BACK
CLASSES ALL DAY. SORRY.

13:19.490 --> 13:23.062
WHY DON'T YOU
TRY ME TOMORROW?

13:23.170 --> 13:24.068
- YOU KNOW WHNACT WE HAVE TO--

13:24.170 --> 13:25.467
- YES.

13:25.570 --> 13:26.525

13:26.630 --> 13:28.029

13:29.940 --> 13:30.964

13:31.070 --> 13:32.799

13:32.910 --> 13:33.934
- NOW PLANT YOUR PALMS,
TAKE A DEEP INHALE,

13:34.040 --> 13:35.803
AND LIFT YOUR HEART.

13:35.910 --> 13:38.970
GOOD. COBRA POSE.
SHOULDERS BACK.

13:39.080 --> 13:41.947
YEAH, RELAX YOUR FACE.

13:42.050 --> 13:44.189

13:44.290 --> 13:45.917
IT'S GOTTA BE
100 DEGREES IN HERE.

13:46.020 --> 13:48.079
- 105 ACTUALLY.

13:48.190 --> 13:51.421
BIKRAM USES HEAT TO ALLOW
FOR DEEPER STRETCHING.

13:51.530 --> 13:52.827
- NOW LET'S BEGIN
A SLOW TRANSITION

13:52.930 --> 13:54.921
FROM COBRA INTO LOCUST.

13:54.960 --> 13:55.119
- [whining groans]

13:59.670 --> 14:00.830
I GOT COBRA!

14:00.940 --> 14:03.465
I'M A COBRA.

14:03.570 --> 14:05.003
[grunts]

14:05.110 --> 14:06.338

14:06.440 --> 14:07.998

14:08.110 --> 14:09.600
- I HAVE A QUARTER LOCUST.
- UM...

14:09.710 --> 14:10.972

14:11.080 --> 14:12.445
PLEASE, HELP ME.
I'M AFRAID.

14:12.550 --> 14:14.609
[groans]
- OKAY. HERE.

14:14.720 --> 14:15.914
- I CAN'T CONTROL MY ASS.

14:15.950 --> 14:16.109
I CAN'T CONTROL MY ASS.

14:18.250 --> 14:19.319
[groans]

14:19.420 --> 14:20.352
- OKAY, OKAY,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:20.460 --> 14:21.859
IF I ANSWER YOUR QUESTION,

14:21.960 --> 14:23.086
WILL YOU STOP
TRYING TO RUIN MY CLASS?

14:23.190 --> 14:24.919
- YES, PERHAPS.

14:24.960 --> 14:25.119
HAVE YOU TAUGHT A DARK-HAIRED
GIRL NAMED KIMBERLY?

14:28.430 --> 14:30.068
- YEAH, SHE'S A REGULAR.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.320

14:35.440 --> 14:37.965
LIVES IN THE BUILDING CLOSE BY,
THE IVANHOE.

14:38.070 --> 14:39.503

14:39.610 --> 14:41.874
[groaning]
LET'S BOUNCE, GUS.

14:41.980 --> 14:44.175
[grunts]

14:48.750 --> 14:51.048
GUS?

14:51.150 --> 14:53.459
- I'M A LITTLE PARCHED,
BUT I FEEL GREAT.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.881

YOU JUST SLEPT FOR 20 MINUTES.

14:55.990 --> 14:58.356

15:04.170 --> 15:06.161
- I DIDN'T KNOW YOU DID BIKRAM.
- UH, YEAH.

15:06.270 --> 15:09.933
A VARIATION WHERE YOU WEAR
ALL YOUR CLOTHES AND YOUR SHOES.

15:10.040 --> 15:11.962
- THAT'S WHY
YOUR SKIN'S SO CLEAN.

15:12.070 --> 15:13.071
- IT IS, ISN'T IT?

15:13.180 --> 15:14.408
- YEAH, YOU'RE,
LIKE, GLISTENING.

15:14.510 --> 15:16.034
- I THINK I'M JUST
HOT FROM CLASS.

15:16.140 --> 15:18.404
- HEY, WE SHOULD TAKE
A YOGA CLASS TOGETHER SOMETIME.

15:18.510 --> 15:20.569
- I'M STILL PRETTY INTO
BEING JULIET'S MAT-MATE.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.341
- OH, YEAH, WELL,
WHO WOULDN'T BE?

15:22.450 --> 15:23.917
I MEAN, SHE'S AWESOME,
RIGHT?

15:24.020 --> 15:25.112
SO TOGETHER AND EASYGOING.

15:25.220 --> 15:26.949

15:27.060 --> 15:29.187
WELL, AWESOME. IT WAS SO RANDOM

RANDOM?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

15:36.030 --> 15:37.327
SHE HAS THE HUBBA-HUBBAS
FOR ME.

15:37.430 --> 15:39.022
- WHATEVS. IF I DON'T

15:39.130 --> 15:40.597
INTO MY SYSTEM SOON,

15:40.700 --> 15:42.338

16:11.800 --> 16:12.164

16:29.720 --> 16:30.687
THEIR LEASE ENDED.

16:30.790 --> 16:32.280

16:48.170 --> 16:48.761
HOW ABOUT YOU JUST SHOW US

16:48.800 --> 16:49.164

17:10.430 --> 17:15.299
- WELL, NOW WE KNOW
WHERE KIMBERLY WAS KILLED.

17:17.300 --> 17:19.427

17:19.530 --> 17:21.589
BUT IF MY INSTINCTS
ARE AS STRONG AS MY BELIEF

17:21.700 --> 17:25.033
THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAX,
IT'LL BE KIMBERLY'S.

17:25.140 --> 17:25.959
- THIS IS UGLY.

17:26.070 --> 17:30.200
WHOEVER KILLED KIMBERLY
IS ONE BAD DUDE.

17:36.450 --> 17:38.111
- YOU KNOW, I'M SENSING
THAT YOU USED TO BE

17:38.220 --> 17:40.780
A HIPSTER OR A HIPPIE,
OR MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH.

17:40.890 --> 17:44.382
OR DUDETTE.

17:45.730 --> 17:47.493
WHERE THE HELL IS CHILLERZ?

17:47.600 --> 17:50.524
- I KNOW.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.167
- DUDE,
I STILL DON'T GET IT.

17:55.270 --> 17:56.498
- THE NOSE RING FOUND

17:56.600 --> 17:58.136
ON THE FLOOR
OF KIMBERLY'S APARTMENT

17:58.240 --> 17:59.662
BELONGED TO LAURA.

17:59.770 --> 18:00.805
IT WAS HER, GUS.

18:00.910 --> 18:02.673
LAURA KILLED KIMBERLY.
- WHY?

18:04.210 --> 18:05.404
WITH AN APARTMENT
THAN LAURA.

18:05.510 --> 18:07.512
THOSE HARDWOOD FLOORS
MADE HER THIGHS SWEAT.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.269
SHE WANTED TO LIVE THERE
SO BAD

18:09.380 --> 18:11.848
THAT SHE KILLED JULIET'S
FIRST CHOICE OF ROOMMATES

18:11.950 --> 18:13.781
TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.
- THAT THEORY IS WHACKED.

18:13.890 --> 18:15.687
IF THAT'S TRUE, THEN SHE'S
A HALL OF FAMER NUTJOB.

18:15.790 --> 18:17.428
- FIRST BALLOT.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.452
IN FACT, I'M SURPRISED
YOU HAVEN'T DATED HER.

18:19.560 --> 18:21.198
- [laughs]

18:21.300 --> 18:23.325
- THAT'S JULES.

18:23.430 --> 18:25.625
- AND SHE'S FLIRTING
WITH THOSE DUDES.

18:25.730 --> 18:27.789
- THIS IS NOT HAPPENING.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.788
OKAY, BOYS, CHOP CHOP.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.106
I THINK I'LL TAKE IT
FROM HERE.

18:31.210 --> 18:33.678
WHAT ARE YOU DO--
- SHAWN?

18:33.780 --> 18:37.807
WE HAVE GOTTA STOP RUNNING
INTO EACH OTHER LIKE THIS.

18:42.350 --> 18:43.817
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF MY NEW LOOK?

18:43.920 --> 18:46.480
- IT'S GOOD. YEAH--NO.
IT'S GOOD.

18:46.590 --> 18:50.481
I'VE BEEN PARTIAL TO THIS LOOK
FOR YEARS NOW.

18:50.590 --> 18:51.818
- WELL, I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE
THIS BLONDE, SO I THOUGHT

18:51.930 --> 18:53.852
"WHAT THE HELL,"
AND I JUST WENT FOR IT.

18:53.960 --> 18:56.690
IT FEELS SO FRESH.
- IT IS FRESH.

18:56.800 --> 18:58.722
- IT'S CRAZY FRESH.

18:58.830 --> 19:00.263
- SO WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DRINKING?
- ZIMAS.

19:00.370 --> 19:03.134
- THEY STOPPED MAKING THOSE
FOUR YEARS AGO.

19:03.240 --> 19:05.401
- YEAH, WE STOCKPILED.
THEY'RE IN THE CAR.

19:05.510 --> 19:07.728
- WE SHOULD GO GET THEM.
- THAT'S A GREAT CALL.

19:07.840 --> 19:09.774
WE'LL BE BACK.
WELL, WE--

19:09.810 --> 19:10.174
- IN RELATED NEWS,
POLICE ARE REPORTING

19:11.510 --> 19:13.717
THAT A LOCAL WOMAN,
KIMBERLY GUERIN,

19:13.820 --> 19:15.845
WAS KILLED IN HER APARTMENT
HERE AT THE IVANHOE

19:15.950 --> 19:18.646
AND THEN MOVED
TO A FIELD NEARBY.

19:18.750 --> 19:21.412
THERE ARE NO SUSPECT S
AT THIS TIME.

19:21.520 --> 19:23.329
WE DO HAVE THE BUILDING MANAGER
STANDING BY.

19:23.430 --> 19:24.328
DAVE, COULD YOU COME ON OVER?

19:24.430 --> 19:25.419
- THAT IS INSANE.

19:25.530 --> 19:27.498
I GOTTA CALL JULES.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.919
[phone rings]

19:29.030 --> 19:30.895
- HEY, WHAT ARE Y--
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?

19:31.000 --> 19:33.935
- HEY. HEY, HEY.

19:34.040 --> 19:37.339
LAURA HAS GONE
FULL SINGLE WHITE FEMALE

19:37.440 --> 19:39.658
AND AS THE STEVEN WEBER
TO YOUR BRIDGET FONDA,

19:39.770 --> 19:42.307
I AM SECONDS AWAY FROM TAKING
A STILETTO TO THE EYEBALL.

19:42.410 --> 19:43.946
- AND EVERYONE KNOWS
THAT'S THE PSYCHO DEATHBLOW.

19:44.050 --> 19:46.371
- WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?

19:46.480 --> 19:48.277
- LAURA KILLED KIMBERLY
SO THAT YOU WOULD PICK HER

19:48.380 --> 19:49.415
TO BE YOUR ROOMMATE INSTEAD.

19:49.520 --> 19:50.839
- THAT IS ABSURD
AND YOU KNOW IT!

19:50.950 --> 19:52.383
- OH, YEAH?
- REALLY?

19:52.490 --> 19:54.253
- FEAST YOUR EYES
ON YOUR EVIL TWIN.

19:54.360 --> 19:58.785
IT'S LIKE LOOKING INTO
A FUNHOUSE MIRROR, ISN'T IT?

19:58.890 --> 20:00.426
WHAT--

20:00.530 --> 20:01.622
- SHAWN, IF THIS IS ANOTHER ONE
OF YOUR STALL TACTICS,

20:01.730 --> 20:03.322
THEY HAVE GOT TO STOP.

20:03.430 --> 20:05.261
- EXCUSE ME, MA'AM,
YOU FORGOT YOUR BAG AT THE BAR.

20:05.370 --> 20:06.792
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

20:06.830 --> 20:07.194
SEE? YOU SEE? EVEN THE
WAITRESSES CAN'T TELL YOU APART.

20:10.040 --> 20:11.507
- OH, MY GOD, SHE MUST HAVE SIX
IDs HERE WITH DIFFERENT NAMES.

20:11.610 --> 20:12.907
- YEAH, ONE FOR EACH VOICE
IN HER HEAD.

20:13.010 --> 20:14.477
- SHE'S AN IDENTITY THIEF.

20:14.580 --> 20:15.808
- WITH A KEY TO MY HOUSE.
- OUR HOUSE,

20:15.840 --> 20:16.204
IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR STREET.
- WE GOTTA GO.

20:20.780 --> 20:22.645
- ALL OF MY CLOTHES
ARE GONE.

20:22.750 --> 20:25.412
ALL OF THEM BUT THIS.
THIS!

20:25.520 --> 20:26.942
- [laughs]

20:27.050 --> 20:28.586
I GUESS THERE IS A SILVER LINING
TO EVERY TRAGEDY.

20:28.690 --> 20:29.816
- WENDY, WE'VE HEARD
THIS NAME BEFORE.

20:29.920 --> 20:31.820
- WENDY?

20:31.930 --> 20:34.490
- SHE LIVED
WITH THAT TASTY GAL, WENDY.

20:34.600 --> 20:37.899
- KIMBERLY'S BUILDING MANAGER.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.797
KIMBERLY'S ROOMMATE
MUST HAVE BEEN LAURA

20:39.830 --> 20:39.989
USING THE ALIAS "WENDY...

20:42.600 --> 20:44.659
SPITS-IT-OUT-SNUGGLE-STEIN ."

20:44.770 --> 20:46.328
- SPITZNAGLE. IT'S GERMAN.
- YOU'RE GERMAN.

20:46.440 --> 20:47.839
- YOUR MAMA'S GERMAN.
- YOUR WEENIE'S GERMAN.

20:47.940 --> 20:49.237
- STOP IT, SHAWN.
- THAT'S DISTURBING.

20:49.340 --> 20:51.649
- NO, THIS IS PURE PSYCHO.

20:51.750 --> 20:54.514
NOW WENDY/LAURA
MOVED IN WITH KIMBERLY,

20:54.620 --> 20:56.440
STOLE HER IDENTITY,
AND KILLED HER.

20:56.550 --> 20:58.916
AND SHE WAS PROBABLY PLANNING
ON DOING THE SAME THING TO YOU.

20:59.020 --> 21:01.887
ON AN UNRELATED NOTE,
SHE HAD THE HUBBA-HUBBAS FOR ME.

21:01.990 --> 21:04.823
- YEAH, I THINK SHE HAD THOSE
FOR A LOT OF GUYS, SHAWN.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.886
- NO, I THINK IT WAS SOMETHING
VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT ME,

21:06.990 --> 21:08.526
MAYBE MY MASSIVE PHEROMONES.

21:08.630 --> 21:11.963
- HELLO?

21:12.070 --> 21:13.958
- HEY, PARTY BOY,
LET ME GUESS.

21:14.070 --> 21:16.664
YOU MET LAURA EARLIER
AT CHILLERZ WITH A "Z."

21:16.770 --> 21:18.965
- YEAH.
SHE GAVE ME HER DEETS.

21:19.070 --> 21:20.571
SUGGESTED I COME BY LATER.

21:20.680 --> 21:21.931
- WELL, I HATE
TO BREAK IT TO YOU,

21:22.040 --> 21:23.746
BUT SHE GIVES HER "DEETS"
TO A LOT OF GUYS.

21:23.850 --> 21:25.841
- PLUS, SHE'S A MURDERER.

21:25.950 --> 21:28.817
- WOW.

21:28.850 --> 21:29.009
ARE YOU SINGLE?

21:30.120 --> 21:33.988
- NO. NO, SHE ISN'T.
- OKAY.

21:34.090 --> 21:35.819
- THIS GOT AWKWARD.

21:35.860 --> 21:36.019
- IT IS A LITTLE AWKWARD.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.955
- I'M GONNA GO.
- YEAH.

21:40.060 --> 21:41.425
- YEP.

21:41.530 --> 21:43.327
- WELL,
IT'S GETTING PRETTY LATE.

21:43.430 --> 21:45.728
GUS SHOULD PROBABLY GO HOME
AND I'LL, UH, BE CRASHING HERE

21:45.830 --> 21:46.990
JUST IN CASE
JENNIFER JASON LEIGH

21:47.100 --> 21:47.839
DECIDES TO COME BACK.

21:47.870 --> 21:48.029
- NICE TRY, SHAWN.

21:49.700 --> 21:50.962
- YOU'RE NOT STAYING HERE ALONE.
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

21:51.070 --> 21:53.709
- STOP. I AM ARMED.
I AM TRAINED.

21:53.810 --> 21:55.334
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

21:55.440 --> 21:58.705
- I KNOW. JUST PROMISE ME
YOU'LL BE EXTRA CAREFUL.

21:58.810 --> 22:01.813
- I PROMISE.

22:06.990 --> 22:08.389
OH, MY GOD.

22:08.490 --> 22:12.426
- SEE YOU THIS WEEKEND,
LITTLE DUDE.

22:14.060 --> 22:18.497
WOODY, UH, WHAT, UH--
- HEY, YOU MADE IT.

22:18.600 --> 22:19.589
SORRY ABOUT THE CON FUSION.

22:19.700 --> 22:20.928
I HAD TO RELOCATE QUICKLY.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.598
- WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE BEACH, MAN?

22:22.700 --> 22:25.407
- FIRST I HAD TO MOVE
THE AIRSTREAM TO A NEARBY PARK

22:25.510 --> 22:27.774
BECAUSE BEACH PATROL
HAS A ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY

22:27.880 --> 22:29.939
ON LIGHTNING RODS
AND AMATEUR GLASS-BLOWING.

22:30.040 --> 22:31.644
- WHAT ABOUT THE PROS?
- NO, PROS ARE OKAY.

22:31.750 --> 22:33.877
THEN I HAD TO MOVE HERE
BECAUSE PEOPLE AT THE PARK

22:33.980 --> 22:35.743
KEPT LINING UP AT THE WINDOW
TO ORDER FOOD.

22:35.850 --> 22:38.080
I MADE 40 BUCKS
SLINGING PB&Js AND THEN SPLIT.

22:38.190 --> 22:41.409
- WOODY, WE'RE IN AN ALLEY
NEXT TO THE LANDFILL.

22:41.520 --> 22:43.112
- YOU ARE RIGHT,
BUT DON'T WORRY, BUDDY.

22:43.220 --> 22:45.120
I'VE GOT SOMETHING
THAT'S GONNA MAKE UP FOR IT.

22:45.230 --> 22:47.551
- YOU FIXED THE TOILET?

22:47.660 --> 22:50.663
- BETTER.

22:50.770 --> 22:52.897
I WRASTLED UP A COUPLE
OF COUGARS FROM THE OWL'S NEST,

22:53.000 --> 22:54.888
THE HOTTEST DIVE BAR IN TOWN.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.458
MAYLENE, THUMPER,
THIS IS MY ROOMIE, SHAWN.

22:58.570 --> 22:59.502
- [awkward laugh]

22:59.610 --> 23:00.702
- HI, DON.

23:00.810 --> 23:04.007
- OH...
[both laugh]

23:04.110 --> 23:05.702
- HELL NO.

23:05.810 --> 23:07.414
- COME ON, ROOMIE.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.374
FALL ON THE GRENADE FOR ME
SO I CAN HAVE THE OTHER ONE.

23:09.480 --> 23:13.883
- WHICH ONE IS THE GRENADE?

23:13.990 --> 23:15.981
- I DON'T REMEMBER.

23:16.090 --> 23:19.685
- WOODY, AS ENTICING AS THIS
OFFER IS, I'M NOT TOM SIZEMORE.

23:19.790 --> 23:22.953
PLUS I'M STILL
A LITTLE HUNG UP ON JULES.

23:23.060 --> 23:24.698
- I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BREAK THIS
TO YOU, SHAWN,

23:24.800 --> 23:27.667
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE I SAW JULIET
AT THE OWL'S NEST.

23:27.770 --> 23:29.567
SHE WAS CHATTING UP
ALL KINDS OF GUYS.

23:29.670 --> 23:35.131
- THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE,
SHE'S AT HOME, I JUST--LAURA.

23:35.240 --> 23:37.003
LAURA!
- OW.

23:37.110 --> 23:38.702
- I GOTTA CALL JULES.
I GOTTA--

23:38.810 --> 23:40.107
I GOTTA TELL HER
TO GET OVER THERE.

23:40.210 --> 23:42.417
- RIGHT. YOU GOT IT, ROOMIE.

23:42.520 --> 23:44.841
WISH ME LUCK.

23:44.890 --> 23:45.049
OKAY, LADIES.

23:46.220 --> 23:47.653
LET'S TALK SAFE WORDS.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.955
[laughter]

23:55.960 --> 23:59.521
- WHAT A PATHETIC JUKE JOINT.

23:59.630 --> 24:03.168
THIS IS WHERE DESPERATE,
LONELY PEOPLE COME TO DIE.

24:03.270 --> 24:06.706
ONE SCRATCHY SPIN
OF AGAINST THE WIN AT A TIME.

24:06.810 --> 24:08.209
- HENRY?

24:08.310 --> 24:11.473
- WHEN DID THEY TURN THIS OVER
FROM AN APPLEBEE'S?

24:11.580 --> 24:12.774
I MUST BE AT THE WRONG SPOT.

24:12.880 --> 24:14.814
- HENRY.

24:14.920 --> 24:15.875
- I'VE NEVER MET THAT GUY.

24:15.980 --> 24:17.584
- THE USUAL?

24:17.690 --> 24:19.043
- YOU MUST BE THINKING
OF A DIFFERENT HENRY.

24:19.150 --> 24:22.017
- ONE HENRY SPENCER COMING UP.
- REALLY?

24:22.120 --> 24:23.951
- THIS IS WHAT RETIREMENT
LOOKS LIKE?

24:24.060 --> 24:25.755
- I TOOK A BULLET
TO THE CHEST, CARLTON.

24:25.860 --> 24:27.498
I'M GONNA START LIVING LIFE,
AND I DON'T NEED

24:27.600 --> 24:29.750
JUDGMENTAL CRAP SPEWING OUT
OF YOUR HAPPILY MARRIED ASS.

24:29.860 --> 24:33.227
OKAY?
SPEAKING OF WHICH, JULIET,

24:33.330 --> 24:37.960
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT YOU
AND SHAWN. REALLY.

24:38.070 --> 24:41.631
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'VE GOT SOME FLIRTING TO DO.

24:41.740 --> 24:45.642
- THESE SPENCERS
ARE SUCH A TRAGIC PAIR.

24:45.750 --> 24:47.615
ONE'S PICKING UP BUTTS
IN THIS ASHTRAY

24:47.720 --> 24:49.870
AND THE OTHER'S WASTING OUR TIME
ON A BAD LEAD.

24:49.980 --> 24:53.552
LAURA'S NOT EVEN HERE.

24:53.660 --> 24:57.721
- WAIT, I HAVE AN IDEA.

24:57.830 --> 25:02.529
HEY, SO, I TOTALLY FORGOT
TO PAY MY TAB BEFORE I LEFT.

25:02.630 --> 25:04.791
- NO, BABE,
YOU GAVE ME CASH.

25:04.900 --> 25:05.798
YOU BACK FOR MORE?

25:05.900 --> 25:07.993
- WHERE DID I GO AFTER?

25:08.100 --> 25:10.739
- HOW DRUNK ARE YOU?

25:10.840 --> 25:13.138
OUT BACK.
- OKAY.

25:13.240 --> 25:14.935
[angry grunt]

25:15.040 --> 25:18.498
- YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY JUST WALK AWAY.

25:18.610 --> 25:22.512
- BEST DAY OFF. EVER.

25:27.890 --> 25:31.883
THAT'S LAURA! LET'S GO.

25:35.360 --> 25:38.568
[siren blares]

25:50.080 --> 25:53.675
I SEE HER UP AHEAD.

25:53.780 --> 25:56.010
- DETECT IVES LASSITER AND O'HARA
IN PURSUIT OF A WHITE JEEP

25:56.120 --> 25:58.008
HEADING SOUTHBOUND
ON ROLAND ROAD,

25:58.120 --> 26:01.886
REQUESTING BACKUP
FOR A FELONY STOP.

26:08.130 --> 26:09.597
- SHE'S DRIVING
LIKE A MAD WOMAN.

26:09.700 --> 26:11.019
HOW MANY DRINKS
DID SHE HAVE?

26:11.130 --> 26:14.861
- STAY ON HER TAIL.
SHE'S STILL WITHIN REACH.

26:18.940 --> 26:19.929
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
[tires screeching]

26:20.040 --> 26:23.874
WHOA! WHO THE HELL
IS THIS MANIAC?

26:23.980 --> 26:24.878
- THEY'RE CHASING HER TOO!

26:24.980 --> 26:27.915
- GO GET 'EM.

26:33.760 --> 26:34.749
WHERE THE HELL DID THEY GO?

26:34.860 --> 26:35.952
- DAMN IT!

26:36.060 --> 26:39.826
- TAKE THAT ROAD UP THERE
TO THE RIGHT.

26:42.030 --> 26:43.156
- OH, MY GOD.

26:43.260 --> 26:46.058
SOMEONE WENT OVER THE BRIDGE.

27:05.820 --> 27:09.756
- THAT IS WHEN
THE BLACK SUV CUT US OFF.

27:29.910 --> 27:32.049
- WHAT THE--
- NOT A WORD.

27:32.150 --> 27:33.174
IT'S ALL I HAVE TO WEAR.

27:33.280 --> 27:36.215
- WOW.

27:36.320 --> 27:39.414
- ANYWAY, UH,
HER BODY WAS NEVER FOUND,

27:39.520 --> 27:40.919
SO SHE MUST
HAVE BEEN EJECTED

27:41.020 --> 27:42.009
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
UPON IMPACT.

27:42.120 --> 27:43.212
THE ONLY THING
WE FOUND IN THE CAR

27:43.320 --> 27:45.959
WAS THIS LADY-TYPE
PANTSUIT JACKET.

27:46.060 --> 27:49.029
LOOKS LIKE ONE OF YOURS, O'HARA.
- WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE IT IS.

27:49.130 --> 27:50.859
- RIGHT.
- MM.

27:50.970 --> 27:52.028
- WELL, IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER,

27:52.130 --> 27:53.734
I THINK MS. BUCK'S
THIEVING PAST

27:53.840 --> 27:55.262
HAS FINALLY COME BACK
TO BITE HER IN THE ASS.

27:55.370 --> 27:57.804
GRIFTERS ALWAYS
HAVE LEGIONS OF ENEMIES,

27:57.910 --> 27:59.104
AND I'M GUESSING
THE DRIVER OF THIS BLACK FORD

27:59.210 --> 28:00.837
WAS LEADER OF THE PACK.

28:00.940 --> 28:02.339
- THEY FORCED HER OFF THE ROAD
TO GET REVENGE.

28:02.440 --> 28:04.078
- [snaps fingers]
- ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA EXAMINE

28:04.180 --> 28:05.408
ALL OF LAURA'S FAKE IDs

28:05.510 --> 28:06.943
AND TRACK DOWN
HER FORMER ROOMMATES.

28:07.050 --> 28:08.119
MAYBE ONE OF THEM
WAS THE DRIVER.

28:08.220 --> 28:11.383
IT COULD AT LEAST
FILL IN SOME BLANKS.

28:11.490 --> 28:15.017
- HEY, LASSIE,
RUN THAT DASH CAM FOOTAGE BACK.

28:15.120 --> 28:18.248
STOP THERE.

28:18.360 --> 28:22.820
I SWEAR I'VE SEEN
THAT CAR BEFORE.

28:22.930 --> 28:23.862
[knock on door]

28:23.970 --> 28:26.325
HELLO THERE...DAVE.

28:26.430 --> 28:31.333
DUDE, WE GOTTA GO TALK
TO THAT LANDLORD AGAIN.

28:31.440 --> 28:33.135
IT COULD BE HIM.

28:33.240 --> 28:36.334
SO DAVE ICED KIMBERLY,

28:36.440 --> 28:38.704
LAURA FOUND OUT AND THEN DAVE
RAN HER RIGHT OFF THE ROAD.

28:38.810 --> 28:40.949
- WHY DID YOU WAIT TILL NOW
TO TELL ME THIS IN THE HALLWAY?

28:41.050 --> 28:43.018
- 'CAUSE ON THE WAY OVER WE WERE
SINGING LEVERT.

28:43.120 --> 28:46.942
- IT WAS HOUDINI, SHAWN.
- MAN, YOU DON'T KNOW WHO.

28:47.050 --> 28:49.052
- YOU GUYS?
- DAVE.

28:49.160 --> 28:51.481
SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU FROM
BEING DRUNK AND SUPER SLOPPY,

28:51.590 --> 28:53.148
BUT WE HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION.

28:53.260 --> 28:54.921
- DO YOU DRIVE A BLACK FORD?

28:55.030 --> 28:56.918
- THE ONLY THING I DRIVE
IS THAT SCHWINN.

28:57.030 --> 28:59.760
MY LICENSE GOT REVOKED BACK
IN THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION.

28:59.870 --> 29:02.031
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY
YEARS AGO THAT WAS?

29:02.140 --> 29:06.065
THAT WAS, LIKE...

29:06.170 --> 29:07.068
- DON'T--DON'T
HURT YOURSELF, DAVE.

29:07.170 --> 29:08.068
- WOW.
- HE'S NOT OUR GUY.

29:08.180 --> 29:09.738
- NO. SO BY CHANCE,

29:09.840 --> 29:11.046
DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE INFO
ON WENDY?

29:11.150 --> 29:14.074
- NO. OH,
JUST SOME LEFTOVER MAIL

29:14.180 --> 29:15.374
THAT WAS DELIVERED TODAY.

29:15.480 --> 29:17.744
- LET'S SEE HERE.

29:17.850 --> 29:21.183
NO. NO. THIS LOOKS
LIKE A PHONE BILL.

29:21.290 --> 29:22.917
- DUDE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:23.020 --> 29:25.921
YOU'RE ABOUT TO COMMIT
A FEDERAL CRIME.

29:26.030 --> 29:28.021
- DAVE, MY MAN,
OPEN THIS PUPPY FOR ME, HUH?

29:28.130 --> 29:29.358
- YEAH.
- GET IN THERE, SON.

29:29.460 --> 29:32.395
ALL UP IN THERE.

29:35.970 --> 29:38.029
BUNCH OF CALLS TO A 501 NUMBER.

29:38.140 --> 29:41.405
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?
- LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS.

29:41.510 --> 29:43.899
WHAT? ONE OF MY FAVORITE
BATHROOM READS

29:44.010 --> 29:44.908
IS AREAS AND ZIPS.

29:45.010 --> 29:46.477
CODES FOR CODE LOVERS.

29:46.580 --> 29:49.913
- WOW, I THOUGHT
I WAS LONELY.

29:49.950 --> 29:50.109
[phone rings]

29:51.450 --> 29:53.338
- LAYNIE, I'M SO SORRY
WE GOT CUT OFF.

29:53.450 --> 29:54.986
DID YOU FIND THE LOCKET?
- WHO IS THIS?

29:55.090 --> 29:59.789
- [gasp5]
[dial tone]

29:59.890 --> 30:02.051
- SO LAURA IS STILL ALIVE?
- YES.

30:02.160 --> 30:02.922
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

30:02.960 --> 30:03.119
- WELL I HAD A-A VISION

30:05.270 --> 30:06.862
THAT ONE
OF HER OLD PHONE BILLS

30:06.970 --> 30:07.868
WAS STILL LYING AROUND
HER APARTMENT BUILDING.

30:07.970 --> 30:09.164
- SO WE LOOKED INTO IT

30:09.270 --> 30:10.931
AND DISCOVERED THAT
A BUNCH OF CALLS WERE MADE

30:11.040 --> 30:11.904
FROM A 501 AREA CODE.

30:11.940 --> 30:12.099
- WE CALLED THE NUMBER

30:14.040 --> 30:15.337
AND A VERY CONCERNED WOMAN
ANSWERED,

30:15.440 --> 30:17.943
INDICATING THAT SHE'D
JUST SPOKEN TO LAURA.

30:18.050 --> 30:19.904
WHICH MEANS SHE'S STILL ALIVE
BECAUSE DEAD PEOPLE

30:20.010 --> 30:22.069
ONLY TALK
ON THE PHONE IN MOVIES.

30:22.180 --> 30:24.512
- LIKE CUBA GOODING JR.
IN RADIO.

30:24.620 --> 30:25.587
- NO, THAT'S NOT RIGHT, THAT'S
NOT WHAT THAT FILM IS ABOUT.

30:25.690 --> 30:28.011
- ARE YOU SURE?
- YEAH. RADIO IS ABOUT

30:28.120 --> 30:30.008
A MENTALLY CHALLENGED CHARACTER
WITH HUGE VENEERS

30:30.120 --> 30:31.929
WHO WANTED T8l-ITLAY FOOTBALL.

30:32.030 --> 30:34.248
- GUYS, HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN
WHAT HAPPENED ON THE BRIDGE?

30:34.360 --> 30:37.249
- WELL, FOR STARTERS, SHE DIDN'T
GET RUN OFF THE BRIDGE.

30:37.360 --> 30:38.588
IF THE BLACK FORD
HAD DRIVEN HER OFF,

30:38.700 --> 30:40.065
THEN THERE WOULD
HAVE BEEN DAMAGE

30:40.170 --> 30:45.062
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE JEEP.

30:45.170 --> 30:46.603
- WHICH THERE WASN'T.

30:46.710 --> 30:47.802
- SHE WANTED EVERYONE
TO THINK SHE HAD DIED.

30:47.910 --> 30:51.073
SO SHE WENT OUT, SHE GOT
LIQUORED UP IN A PUBLIC SETTING

30:51.180 --> 30:53.478
AND SHE DROVE THAT JEEP
OFF THE BRIDGE HERSELF.

30:53.580 --> 30:56.242
INTENTIONALLY.

30:56.350 --> 30:59.239
[crash, splash]

31:03.360 --> 31:06.955
- PRESUMED DEAD, SHE'S FREE
TO MOVE ON TO HER NEXT SCAM.

31:07.060 --> 31:09.051
- WOW, SHAWN,

31:09.160 --> 31:12.459
UH, SAYING THAT YOUR VISION
IS CORRECT,

31:12.570 --> 31:13.992
WHERE DO YOU THINK
LAURA IS NOW?

31:14.100 --> 31:15.965
- GOOD QUESTION,
BUT HERE'S THE THING.

31:16.070 --> 31:18.265
HER NAME'S NOT LAURA.
- NOPE.

31:18.370 --> 31:20.600
- THAT VERY CONCERNED WOMAN
ON THE PHONE LIVES IN ARKANSAS.

31:20.710 --> 31:22.928
SO GUESS WHO ELSE PROBABLY
LIVED THERE AT SOME POINT.

31:22.980 --> 31:23.139
- LAURA.
- DING DING DING DING DING.

31:25.180 --> 31:27.444
- WHOSE NAME
REALLY ISN'T LAURA.

31:27.550 --> 31:31.338
- AND GUESS WHAT THE WOMAN
ON THE PHONE CALLED HER.

31:31.450 --> 31:33.213
- LAYNIE.
SHE CALLED HER LAYNIE.

31:33.320 --> 31:36.118
- WHICH IS PROBABLY
HER REAL NAME.

31:36.220 --> 31:37.585
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL PUT IN AN APB

31:37.690 --> 31:41.091
FOR LAYNIE STROMWALL,
RUN A BACKGROUND CHECK.

31:41.200 --> 31:44.260
- O'HARA, THAT SEARCH FOR
LAURA'S OLD ROOMMATE'S PAID OFF.

31:44.370 --> 31:46.326
SARAH JAMES, THE WOMAN
SHE LIVED WITH IN SAN DIEGO,

31:46.430 --> 31:47.465
IS IN INTERROGATION
RIGHT NOW.

31:47.570 --> 31:48.969
- GREAT. LET'S GO.

31:49.070 --> 31:50.435
- THAT'S HOW WE DO IT, KID.

31:50.540 --> 31:52.337
STILL GOT OUR GOOD STUFF.

31:52.440 --> 31:54.499
- SHAWN.

31:54.610 --> 31:57.408
THINGS GOT WEIRD
AFTER YOU LEFT LAST NIGHT.

31:57.510 --> 31:59.398
- I DON'T KNOW, WOODY,
THINGS WERE ALREADY SUPER WEIRD

31:59.510 --> 32:01.011
BEFORE I LEFT.

32:01.120 --> 32:03.042
- THINGS WERE GOING GREAT
WITH ME AND THE GALS

32:03.150 --> 32:04.686
UNTIL THUMPER GAVE ME
THIS MINT

32:04.790 --> 32:07.042
THAT WASN'T VERY MINTY,
AND THE NEXT THING I KNEW,

32:07.150 --> 32:08.959
WE WERE ALL RIDING UNICORNS.

32:09.060 --> 32:13.087
- UH, WOODY, I DON'T THINK
THUMPER GAVE YOU A MINT.

32:13.190 --> 32:14.999
IT SOUNDS
LIKE A HALLUCINOGEN.

32:15.100 --> 32:17.625
- AND THEN WHEN I RODE MY
GRACEFUL WOODLAND CREATURE BACK,

32:17.730 --> 32:20.369
THE AIRSTREAM WAS GONE.
- WHAT?

32:20.470 --> 32:22.062
- GONE.

32:22.170 --> 32:25.230
- WOODY,
THEY STOLE OUR HOUSE?

32:27.110 --> 32:30.409
- HI, I'M DETECTIVE O'HARA.

32:34.780 --> 32:37.044
THANK YOU FOR COMING
ALL THE WAY FROM SAN DIEGO.

32:37.150 --> 32:38.686
YOU'RE THE ROOMMATE, RIGHT?
- YEAH.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.587
- WHAT KIND OF A ROOMMATE
WAS SHE?

32:40.690 --> 32:43.488
- AMAZING, ACTUALLY.

32:43.590 --> 32:45.558
I MEAN, SURE SHE BORROWED SOME
CLOTHES SHE NEVER GAVE BACK.

32:45.660 --> 32:49.050
BUT SHE ALWAYS PAID
HER SHARE OF THE RENT EARLY,

32:49.160 --> 32:51.060
TOOK CARE OF THE PHONE BILL.

32:51.170 --> 32:54.367
- YEAH, SHE WAS PRETTY LOW-KEY
FOR THE MOST PART.

32:54.470 --> 32:58.509
THE ONLY TIME SHE ACTED STRANGE
WAS THE DAY SHE LEFT.

32:58.610 --> 33:00.134
- WHAT WAS STRANGE ABOUT IT?

33:00.240 --> 33:04.074
- WELL, EARLY THAT MORNING,
WE SAW THIS CAR

33:04.180 --> 33:06.978
PARKED NEAR OUR BUILDING
AND IT SEEMED TO RATTLE HER.

33:07.080 --> 33:09.742
AND THEN SHE JUST UP
AND MOVED OUT.

33:09.850 --> 33:13.445
- WAIT, THE CAR THAT YOU GUYS
SAW, WAS IT A BLACK FORD SUV?

33:13.550 --> 33:16.713
- YES, IT WAS.

33:16.820 --> 33:19.084
- O'HARA, WE HAVE SOMETHING.
- OKAY.

33:19.190 --> 33:20.225
THANK YOU SO MUCH, SARAH.

33:20.330 --> 33:22.594
YOU'VE BEEN A HUGE HELP.

33:22.700 --> 33:23.598
- LAYNIE'S BACKGROUND CHECK
IS CLEAN.

33:23.700 --> 33:25.224
SHE'S A MODEL CITIZEN.

33:25.330 --> 33:27.469
- HOW CAN THIS GIRL
RUN SO MANY SCAMS

33:27.570 --> 33:29.435
AND NOT HAVE A SINGLE BLEMISH
ON HER RECORD?

33:29.540 --> 33:31.269
- AND WHY WOULD SOMEBODY
CHANGE THEIR IDENTITY

33:31.370 --> 33:33.167
OVER AND OVER AGAIN IF THEY
WEREN'T STEALING IDENTITIES

33:33.270 --> 33:35.101
OR RUNNING FROM THE LAW?

33:35.210 --> 33:36.029
- AND WHY DOES CUBA KEEP DOING
SUCH HORRIBLE MOVIES?

33:36.810 --> 33:37.276
THE DUDE
HAS AN ACADEMY AWARD.

33:37.780 --> 33:38.542
- LET IT GO, GUS.

33:39.450 --> 33:40.303
- BOAT TRIP, SHAWN, BOAT TRIP.

33:41.280 --> 33:42.417
- THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT BLACK CAR.

33:43.480 --> 33:43.775
THE ROOMMATE MADE IT SOUND LIKE
THAT'S THE REASON

33:44.320 --> 33:45.389
SHE FLED SAN DIEGO.

33:46.390 --> 33:46.412
- WELL, CLEARLY,
SHE'S FLEEING FROM SOMEONE.

33:47.250 --> 33:48.114
OTHERWISE WHY WOULD
SHE CUT AND RUN

33:48.960 --> 33:50.757
EVERY TIME THAT CAR
COMES AROUND?

33:50.860 --> 33:52.657
- I WAS IN A SERIOUS
RELATIONSHIP ONCE,

33:52.760 --> 33:55.092
AND IT WAS A NIGHTMARE.

33:55.200 --> 33:58.397
- I AM SENSING
THAT SHE'S RUNNING FROM HER EX.

33:58.500 --> 34:00.718
GUYS, THIS IS NO LONGER
SINGLE WHITE FEMALE.

34:00.830 --> 34:02.366
THIS IS
SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY.

34:02.470 --> 34:04.028
- RUNNING FROM THE EX
IS THE SAME THING YOU SENSED

34:04.140 --> 34:05.698
WITH THE SWEDISH GIRL,
AND YOU WERE WRONG.

34:05.810 --> 34:07.334
- I PREFER SPIRITUALLY
MISGUIDED.

34:07.440 --> 34:09.078
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
HE MAY BE RIGHT.

34:09.180 --> 34:12.343
LAYNIE DID MENTION
HAVING TROUBLE WITH AN EX.

34:12.450 --> 34:15.669
- CHECK THIS OUT.

34:15.780 --> 34:19.386
LAURA/LAYNIE'S
WEDDING ANNOUNCEMENT FROM 2006.

34:19.490 --> 34:21.651
THERE'S NO PICTURE
OF THIS PATRICK GUY.

34:21.760 --> 34:24.228
IS THERE ANOTHER NEWSPAPER
IN LITTLE ROCK?

34:24.330 --> 34:25.285
- THE DAILY HERALD.

34:25.390 --> 34:27.358
WHAT?

34:27.460 --> 34:29.052
AFTER I MASTERED AREA CODES,

34:29.160 --> 34:30.559
THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP
WAS LOCAL PERIODICALS.

34:30.660 --> 34:34.596
- HOW ON EARTH DID YOU EVER
GET A GIRLFRIEND?

34:39.910 --> 34:41.332
[knock on door]

34:41.440 --> 34:44.409
- HEY, PARTY BOY.

34:44.510 --> 34:47.638
OH, MY GOD, JULES,
THAT'S--THAT'S THE SAME GUY

34:47.750 --> 34:51.288
THAT CAME BY
YOUR PLACE YESTERDAY.

34:57.690 --> 35:00.579
- IT SAYS HERE THAT HIS FATHER'S
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.

35:00.690 --> 35:02.521
- WHICH IS WHY SHE COULDN'T GET
A RESTRAINING ORDER

35:02.630 --> 35:03.654
AND WHY SHE WAS RUNNING.

35:03.760 --> 35:05.296
- THIS PSYCHO TRACKED HER DOWN

35:05.400 --> 35:06.867
AND KILLED HER ROOMMATE
WHEN SHE WOULDN'T TELL HIM

35:06.970 --> 35:08.130
WHERE LAYNIE WAS.

35:08.240 --> 35:10.094
LAYNIE, COMPLETELY DESPERATE,

35:10.200 --> 35:12.407
FIGURE OUT THE ONLY WAY SHE
COULD GET RID OF HIM FOR GOOD.

35:12.510 --> 35:15.229
- APPEAR AS IF SHE DIED.
- EXACTLY.

35:15.340 --> 35:17.706
IS IT JUST ME OR AM I SENSING
SOME OF OUR OLD CHEMISTRY?

35:17.810 --> 35:18.879
- IT'S JUST YOU.

35:18.980 --> 35:20.208
- OKAY.
- HERE'S A PROBLEM.

35:20.310 --> 35:21.470
THE APB'S ALREADY OUT.

35:21.580 --> 35:22.842
IF THIS PATRICK GUY
GETS WIND OF IT

35:22.950 --> 35:24.178
HE'S GONNA REALIZE
THAT SHE'S STILL ALIVE.

35:24.290 --> 35:26.110
- SHE'S PROBABLY LONG GONE.

35:26.220 --> 35:27.539
- I'M NOT SO SURE.

35:27.650 --> 35:28.810
I MEAN, SHE COULD HAVE FLED

35:28.920 --> 35:30.854
THE SECOND SHE CLEARED OUT
JULIET'S PLACE.

35:30.960 --> 35:33.588
SOMETHING
IS KEEPING HER HERE.

35:33.690 --> 35:35.248
[phone rings]
- LAYNIE.

35:35.360 --> 35:36.896
I'M SO SORRY WE GOT CUT OFF.

35:37.000 --> 35:37.591
DID YOU FIND THE LOCKET?

35:37.630 --> 35:38.198
- WHO IS THIS?
- [gasp5]

35:39.930 --> 35:42.364
- I AM SENSING
SHE IS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.

35:42.470 --> 35:44.904
UH, VERY PERSONAL,
POSSIBLY AN HEIRLOOM.

35:45.010 --> 35:46.637
- HER GREAT GRANDMOTHER'S
LOCKET.

35:46.740 --> 35:48.674
SHE GOT VERY EMOTIONAL
WHEN SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT IT.

35:48.780 --> 35:50.907
- ANY IDEA WHERE
SHE'D BE LOOKING FOR IT?

35:51.010 --> 35:53.308
- HI, I'M LAURA.

35:53.410 --> 35:54.718
- OKAY EVERYBODY,
CLASS IS STARTING.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.344
PLEASE PUT YOUR STUFF
INTO YOUR LOCKERS.

35:56.450 --> 35:58.486
- YES, HER LOCKER
AT THE YOGA STUDIO.

35:58.590 --> 35:59.739
- THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE.

35:59.850 --> 36:00.817
SHE WOULD TAKE IT OFF
TO WORK OUT.

36:00.920 --> 36:03.787
- MAYBE SHE FORGOT.

36:03.890 --> 36:05.482
- OH, MY GOD.

36:05.590 --> 36:08.525
I LOVE YOUR SHIRT.

36:09.700 --> 36:12.168
- [snaps f'
I
SEE?ngers]

36:12.270 --> 36:14.397
- I MUST GET A CHANGE
OF CLOTHES IMMEDIATELY.

36:14.500 --> 36:16.934
OKAY, YOU GUYS GO TO
THE YOGA STUDIO, CHECK IT OUT.

36:17.040 --> 36:18.564
WE WILL ALL MEET BACK HERE
FOR AN UPDATE.

36:18.670 --> 36:20.604
- COPY THAT.

36:27.750 --> 36:29.718
IT'S NOT IN HERE.

36:29.820 --> 36:30.878
YOU SURE THIS
IS LAURA'S LOCKER?

36:30.980 --> 36:32.880
- YEAH, THAT'S HERS.

36:32.990 --> 36:34.480
- [sighs]

36:34.590 --> 36:35.579
- THE HEAT ISN'T EVEN ON.

36:35.690 --> 36:36.850
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

36:36.960 --> 36:38.655
- I'M A SYMPATHETIC SWEATER.

36:38.760 --> 36:42.457
- EWW.
- I KNOW.

37:04.350 --> 37:06.614
- I'M GONNA NEED THAT BACK.

37:06.720 --> 37:09.382
- LAYNIE.

37:09.490 --> 37:12.880
- I AM SO SORRY
I LIED TO YOU, JULIET.

37:12.990 --> 37:15.697
I'VE BEEN RUNNING
FROM MY HUSBAND.

37:15.800 --> 37:19.361
MOVING FROM STATE TO STATE,
ALWAYS LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDER.

37:19.470 --> 37:22.735
I HAVEN'T HAD A NORMAL LIFE
IN SEVEN YEARS.

37:22.840 --> 37:26.867
AND SO I-I TRY AND ACT
LIKE THIS HAPPY, NORMAL GIRL,

37:26.970 --> 37:32.306
BUT I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE ANYMORE.

37:32.410 --> 37:34.970
I THOUGHT I'D FINALLY BE SAFE
LIVING WITH A COP.

37:35.080 --> 37:37.969
I DIDN'T MEAN TO INVOLVE YOU
IN ALL OF THIS

37:38.080 --> 37:40.719
AND STEAL ALL YOUR CLOTHES,
BUT I PANICKED.

37:40.820 --> 37:42.856
I PANICKED BECAUSE I HAD
TO DISGUISE MYSELF RIGHT AWAY.

37:42.960 --> 37:44.882
I AM SO SORRY.
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

37:44.990 --> 37:46.958
- IT'S OKAY.
LAYNIE, IT'S OKAY.

37:47.060 --> 37:51.497
YOU'RE SAFE NOW.
THIS ALL ENDS HERE. OKAY?

37:51.600 --> 37:55.536
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT PATRICK'S CAPABLE OF.

37:59.570 --> 38:01.674
THAT'S HIM.

38:04.480 --> 38:07.699
- AND JULES' CELL
KEEPS GOING TO VOICEMAIL.

38:07.810 --> 38:10.916
I'M GONNA TRY HER AT HOME.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.383
- YOU USED TO LIVE THERE.

38:17.490 --> 38:18.923
HOW DO YOU NOT REMEMBER
YOUR OWN HOME PHONE NUMBER?

38:19.030 --> 38:20.918
- SHH! I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I PUT IT UNDER.

38:21.030 --> 38:23.919
- OH, MY GOSH,
IT'S 555-0135.

38:24.030 --> 38:25.668
- HOW DO YOU REMEMBER
OUR HOME PHONE NUMBER?

38:25.770 --> 38:26.862
- IT'S A PART
OF THE FIBONACCI SEQUENCE.

38:26.970 --> 38:27.994
HOW DO YOU NOT REMEMBER IT?

38:28.100 --> 38:29.465
- WHAT DID YOU
JUST SAY TO ME?

38:29.570 --> 38:30.559
- FIBONACCI.
- YOU TAKE THAT BACK!

38:30.670 --> 38:32.069
- [mutters]

38:32.170 --> 38:33.535
DAMN, IT'S HOT IN HERE.

38:33.640 --> 38:34.800
- IT'S A BUSY SIGNAL.

38:34.910 --> 38:36.309
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

38:36.410 --> 38:39.402
WE GOTTA GET OVER THERE
RIGHT NOW.

38:43.780 --> 38:45.589
- LAYNIE?

38:45.690 --> 38:48.011
OR SHOULD I SAY WENDY?

38:48.120 --> 38:50.816
OR ANDREA?

38:50.920 --> 38:54.390
OR KATELIN OR CASSIDY?

38:54.500 --> 38:58.960
WHICH ONE SHOULD I CALL YOU?

38:59.070 --> 39:02.961
OH, PLEASE COME OUT, BABY.

39:03.070 --> 39:06.733
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

39:06.840 --> 39:09.832
LIFE HAS BEEN MISERABLE
WITHOUT YOU.

39:09.940 --> 39:10.838
WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE TOGETHER FOREVER,

39:10.940 --> 39:14.000
BUT THEN YOU LEFT ME.

39:14.110 --> 39:18.046
DO YOU KNOW
HOW HUMILIATING THAT WAS?

39:23.890 --> 39:25.084
both: HI, PATRICK.

39:25.190 --> 39:28.626
- WHAT THE HELL?

39:28.730 --> 39:31.096
[grunts]

39:31.200 --> 39:33.088
[tires screech]
- JULES!

39:33.200 --> 39:34.792
I'M HERE!

39:34.900 --> 39:36.834
DON'T WORRY, I'M COMING.

39:40.070 --> 39:41.037
[glass shatters]

39:41.140 --> 39:44.075
OH, GOD.

39:48.680 --> 39:50.671
JULES!

40:06.930 --> 40:08.989
- [panting]

40:12.940 --> 40:15.170
- ARE YOU OKAY?

40:15.280 --> 40:17.908
ARE YOU OKAY?

40:18.010 --> 40:20.706
YOU'RE SO LUCKY THAT YOU'RE
UNCONSCIOUS RIGHT NOW!

40:20.810 --> 40:21.708
[thud]

40:21.820 --> 40:23.014
IT'S ALL RIGHT, LADIES.

40:23.120 --> 40:25.008
YOU'RE SAFE NOW.

40:25.120 --> 40:28.009
- [sighs]
IT'S OKAY.

40:32.630 --> 40:35.190
- SHAWN, I CAN TOTALLY
HAVE THE LANDLORD DO THIS.

40:35.300 --> 40:36.824
- UH, UH, JULES.

40:36.860 --> 40:37.019
IF WE'VE LEARNED
ANYTHING THIS WEEK

40:38.770 --> 40:42.991
IT'S THAT LANDLORDS
ARE UNSAVORY INDIVIDUALS.

40:43.100 --> 40:45.000
THAT, AND IF A MYSTERIOUS GUY
SHOWS UP AT A SUSPECT'S HOUSE,

40:45.110 --> 40:46.964
WE SHOULD PROBABLY
ASK HIM A FEW QUESTIONS

40:47.070 --> 40:49.038
BEFORE SENDING HIM
ON HIS MERRY WAY.

40:49.140 --> 40:50.903
- OH, HEY,
I TALKED TO LAYNIE.

40:51.010 --> 40:53.149
SHE IS ON HER WAY TO ARKANSAS
TO BE WITH HER MOM.

40:53.250 --> 40:55.844
SHE'S SO HAPPY.
- VERY GLAD TO HEAR IT.

40:55.950 --> 40:58.214
BEST PART IS SHE'S ALIVE.

40:58.320 --> 41:00.515
- MM-HMM.

41:01.620 --> 41:04.828
[laughs]
- WOW.

41:04.930 --> 41:06.852
MAYBE YOUR NEXT ROOMMATE
WILL BE A LITTLE MORE HANDY.

41:06.890 --> 41:07.049
- NO, NO MORE ROOMMATES. NO.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.628
NOT AFTER ALL THIS.
- REALLY?

41:11.730 --> 41:13.721
I SEEM TO RECALL
ONE ROOMMATE IN PARTICULAR

41:13.830 --> 41:15.092
THAT YOU WERE QUITE FOND OF.

41:15.200 --> 41:17.532
- SHAWN.

41:17.640 --> 41:19.198
- [clears throat]

41:19.310 --> 41:23.098
HEY, I THINK
THAT YOU ARE AMAZING,

41:23.210 --> 41:27.601
AND I MEAN THAT
IN A COMPLETELY PLATONIC--

41:27.710 --> 41:29.814
UNLESS YOU DON'T WANT
IT TO BE PLATONIC

41:29.920 --> 41:34.209
BECAUSE I COULD MAKE THAT HAPPEN
RIGHT NOW--SORT OF WAY.

41:34.320 --> 41:36.857
SERIOUSLY THOUGH, YOU KICKED
THE CRAP OUT OF THAT GUY.

41:36.890 --> 41:37.049
I MEAN, THAT WAS OLD SCHOOL,
EPIC, COBRA KAI,

41:41.360 --> 41:45.126
"DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH
THAT, MR. LAWRENCE?" DOJO STYLE.

41:45.230 --> 41:49.894
- I, TOO, WAS IMPRESSED
WITH YOUR INVESTIGATIVE WORK.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.764
- YEAH, THAT WAS--
WAS PRETTY SPOT ON WASN'T IT?

41:52.870 --> 41:56.271
- YEAH. I COULD HAVE USED
A LITTLE LESS OF THIS...

41:56.380 --> 41:57.836
BUT IT WAS SPOT ON.

41:57.880 --> 41:58.039
- DULY NOTED.
[cell phone rings]

42:03.820 --> 42:06.186
WOOD-MAN, TALK TO ME.

42:06.290 --> 42:08.611
OH, THANK GOODNESS.

42:08.720 --> 42:09.982
HE FOUND THE AIRSTREAM.

42:10.090 --> 42:12.524
I'M NOT HOMELESS ANYMORE.

42:12.630 --> 42:13.983
SO WHERE AM I GOING?

42:14.090 --> 42:17.025
OH, MY GOSH.
