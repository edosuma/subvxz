00:23.940 --> 00:25.970
Your home should be
your domain,

00:26.010 --> 00:28.040
with a space devoted to work.

00:29.550 --> 00:31.850
As I hope my design conveys,
at Quinn & Whistler

00:31.880 --> 00:34.850
we aspire to advance
the concept of housing

00:34.890 --> 00:41.220
from just home to whole life,
with a space for recreation,

00:43.560 --> 00:50.100
and a space to rest in a room
that invites the outside in.

00:50.130 --> 00:51.530
This is a concept house
that does away

00:51.570 --> 00:53.030
with walls and limitations.

00:53.070 --> 00:54.500
The occupant has
complete control

00:54.540 --> 00:57.210
over their inside
and outside worlds.

00:57.240 --> 01:00.340
Using virtual windows you can
gaze at whatever you desire.

01:00.380 --> 01:03.710
That may be a sunny beach.

01:03.750 --> 01:05.780
The New York skyline.

01:07.350 --> 01:10.350
Or you can even have
Christmas 24/7.

01:14.760 --> 01:17.060
How many rooms come equipped
with this feature?

01:17.090 --> 01:18.230
Uh, all of them.

01:18.260 --> 01:20.700
So each inhabitant can have
a personalized experience.

01:20.730 --> 01:22.060
Very impressive.

01:22.100 --> 01:23.030
That's not all.

01:23.070 --> 01:25.200
The house is not only
designed to address

01:25.240 --> 01:28.840
the inhabitant's need
but also intuit their needs.

01:28.870 --> 01:30.970
The house knows when to
put itself and its occupants

01:31.010 --> 01:31.970
into rest mode.

01:32.010 --> 01:34.580
Sensors in the house acclimate
to your patterns

01:34.610 --> 01:37.510
so it knows when you finish work
and go to bed,

01:37.550 --> 01:39.080
and it knows when you wake.

01:39.120 --> 01:41.120
The house wakes up, too.

01:42.450 --> 01:44.590
I feel like I could
move in tomorrow.

01:44.620 --> 01:47.090
I could move in today.

01:47.120 --> 01:49.820
Very, very impressive.

01:59.270 --> 02:01.440
Lacey.

02:01.470 --> 02:03.270
You blew the clients away.

02:03.310 --> 02:05.770
You mean prospective clients.

02:05.810 --> 02:06.880
After your design
and presentation

02:06.910 --> 02:09.539
we are on the verge of landing
the biggest clients

02:09.580 --> 02:11.780
at Quinn & Whistler
has ever had.

02:11.820 --> 02:15.180
♪

02:15.220 --> 02:16.920
It's time to celebrate.

02:16.950 --> 02:18.850
What is this about?

02:18.890 --> 02:20.490
Word travels fast.

02:24.830 --> 02:28.600
So, as all of you have heard,
we are this close to cinching

02:28.630 --> 02:30.430
the Pine Bay Development deal.

02:30.470 --> 02:34.440
It's a housing development
of 20 houses and our design,

02:34.470 --> 02:37.310
our model house is still among
the top choices.

02:37.340 --> 02:39.610
So eat, drink,
and be merry

02:39.640 --> 02:41.980
because after the holidays
it's over.

02:42.010 --> 02:43.310
Overtime for all of you.

02:43.350 --> 02:45.150
[crowd laughs]

02:45.180 --> 02:45.810
To you.

02:45.850 --> 02:47.520
(All): Cheers.

02:48.420 --> 02:50.220
Don't you think it's
a little premature?

02:50.250 --> 02:51.920
Fortune favours the bold.

02:51.960 --> 02:53.760
And workaholics?

02:53.790 --> 02:55.460
To us.

02:55.490 --> 02:57.530
[clink]

03:00.030 --> 03:01.730
Pine Bay emailed
over the specifications

03:01.770 --> 03:03.770
for the revised renderings.

03:03.800 --> 03:05.000
It looks doable.

03:05.040 --> 03:07.100
Nothing that you can't handle.

03:09.110 --> 03:10.810
I can't believe this is
happening now.

03:10.840 --> 03:13.170
Could the timing be any worse
for the career shot

03:13.210 --> 03:14.510
of a lifetime?

03:14.540 --> 03:15.310
You mean the holidays?

03:15.350 --> 03:17.610
We broke through
Christmas before.

03:17.650 --> 03:20.650
I mean Ava's wedding.

03:20.680 --> 03:22.320
Right.

03:24.320 --> 03:25.420
I fly out tonight.

03:25.460 --> 03:26.750
It's five days away.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.160
I'm maid of honour, remember?

03:28.190 --> 03:29.190
Cancel.

03:29.230 --> 03:30.260
[laughs]

03:30.290 --> 03:31.190
Walter.

03:31.230 --> 03:32.130
You get the flu,
it's bad.

03:32.160 --> 03:32.930
Pine Bay Development flu.

03:32.960 --> 03:33.760
It's contagious.

03:33.800 --> 03:34.960
You don't wanna get
anybody sick.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.200
I mean, you weren't that eager
to go in some winter lodge

03:37.230 --> 03:39.700
and wear a big poofy dress,
were you?

03:39.740 --> 03:41.670
I'm pretty sure backing out
of your best friend's wedding

03:41.710 --> 03:43.000
is ground for friends divorce.

03:43.040 --> 03:43.870
Right.

03:43.910 --> 03:46.510
Besides, it's Christmas.

03:46.540 --> 03:48.340
When miracles happen.

03:48.380 --> 03:50.680
And I promise we will get
all of the work done

03:50.710 --> 03:51.810
and we will land this deal.

03:51.850 --> 03:53.950
Promise?

03:53.980 --> 03:56.650
Have I ever let you down?

03:56.690 --> 03:58.320
Never.

04:02.330 --> 04:04.330
See you in a few days.

04:39.760 --> 04:41.200
Thank you.

04:59.720 --> 05:00.620
Ava!

05:00.650 --> 05:01.250
Hi!

05:01.280 --> 05:02.050
You're here!

05:02.090 --> 05:03.950
Hi!

05:03.990 --> 05:05.050
Isn't it all just the best?

05:05.090 --> 05:07.190
Christmas, my wedding,
two of my favourite things.

05:07.220 --> 05:08.460
Since you were
six years old.

05:08.490 --> 05:09.520
Five, actually.

05:09.560 --> 05:10.630
[laughs]

05:10.660 --> 05:12.230
Tell me this isn't a case of
last minute cold feet.

05:12.260 --> 05:13.460
Hardly.

05:13.500 --> 05:15.930
I just thought I'd take some
stuff up to the cottage today.

05:15.970 --> 05:16.930
I know in all of
the wedding madness

05:16.970 --> 05:19.930
Mason and I will forget things
that we need.

05:19.970 --> 05:21.000
Come with me?

05:21.040 --> 05:22.870
I mean, it's been forever
since we've both seen it

05:22.910 --> 05:25.570
and we've spent so many
happy times there.

05:25.610 --> 05:27.940
I would love to
but I was going to try

05:27.980 --> 05:29.780
and get a little work in
before the welcome party.

05:29.810 --> 05:31.750
We're on the verge of landing
this huge project.

05:31.780 --> 05:32.650
Oh.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.280
I was kind of hoping
that this could be

05:34.320 --> 05:36.280
a work-free zone for you.

05:36.320 --> 05:37.650
I'm sure I can spare
a little time.

05:37.690 --> 05:39.250
[squeals]
OK.

05:39.290 --> 05:40.290
Let me put my suitcase upstairs.

05:40.320 --> 05:42.190
OK, let's go.

05:43.030 --> 05:43.960
So, how's Roger?

05:43.990 --> 05:45.090
He's great.

05:45.130 --> 05:46.760
Our design firm is doing
really well.

05:46.800 --> 05:49.160
No, I wasn't asking about your
professional life with Roger,

05:49.200 --> 05:50.930
I was asking
about your personal life.

05:50.970 --> 05:52.400
Our relationship makes sense.

05:52.440 --> 05:54.900
We're great partners,
we get each other.

05:54.940 --> 05:55.900
Really?

05:55.940 --> 05:57.670
He's smart and accomplished.

05:57.710 --> 05:59.940
He's driven.

06:00.840 --> 06:02.510
He's handsome and successful
and I never have

06:02.550 --> 06:04.780
to worry about what
his priorities are.

06:04.810 --> 06:06.680
Well, that's all great
but not exactly

06:06.720 --> 06:09.620
"sweep you off your feet" great.

06:09.650 --> 06:10.850
Don't you want that?

06:10.890 --> 06:11.820
True love?

06:11.860 --> 06:12.790
Passion?

06:12.820 --> 06:14.260
Romance?

06:14.290 --> 06:18.430
I did, probably, you know,
when I was a teenager.

06:18.460 --> 06:20.600
Getting swept off your feet
isn't everything,

06:20.630 --> 06:22.600
and with Roger
everything's clear.

06:22.630 --> 06:25.130
He's reliable, stable,
predictable.

06:25.170 --> 06:25.870
There's no-

06:25.900 --> 06:26.830

06:26.870 --> 06:28.700
Ean!

06:28.740 --> 06:29.470
Hi!

06:29.510 --> 06:30.840
Hi, little sis!

06:30.870 --> 06:32.570
Surprises.

06:35.850 --> 06:36.880
Lacey, dear.

06:36.910 --> 06:38.680
Aunt Sarah.

06:39.820 --> 06:41.050
Oh my gosh.

06:41.080 --> 06:43.480
Oh, what a treat to have
you here.

06:43.520 --> 06:46.190
So, I hear you're quite
accomplished now.

06:46.220 --> 06:47.420
I never doubted it.

06:47.460 --> 06:49.190
You know, all that time you
spent drawing up in the cottage.

06:49.230 --> 06:50.560
I knew it would mount
to something.

06:50.590 --> 06:52.860
You were always encouraging
my creativity.

06:52.900 --> 06:54.160
It meant a lot.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.260
Especially when my mom
passed away

06:55.300 --> 06:58.230
and my dad was trying to do
everything on his own.

06:58.270 --> 07:01.140
It's terrible to lose a parent
when you're so young.

07:01.170 --> 07:03.970
But I was honoured to be
your village.

07:04.010 --> 07:06.170
Aww.

07:06.210 --> 07:08.340
Oh, you have to find me and
tell me all about your life

07:08.380 --> 07:09.910
in San Francisco.

07:09.950 --> 07:10.410
OK.

07:10.450 --> 07:11.010
Promise?

07:11.050 --> 07:11.680
Mmmhmm.

07:11.710 --> 07:12.810
I can't believe you made it.

07:12.850 --> 07:14.920
You really kept us guessing up
until the last minute.

07:14.950 --> 07:17.690
I know, my schedule's
a little erratic.

07:17.720 --> 07:21.390
But even vagabond chef's can't
miss their sister's wedding.

07:21.420 --> 07:23.830
And look, an early
wedding gift.

07:23.860 --> 07:26.760
Fresh mistletoe from an island
off the coast of Scandinavia.

07:26.800 --> 07:28.530
I will hang this in
the Christmas Cottage.

07:28.570 --> 07:32.400
I'm on my way there now
with Lacey.

07:34.570 --> 07:36.200
Oh.

07:36.240 --> 07:37.440
Great.

07:37.470 --> 07:38.540
That's... that's great.

07:38.580 --> 07:41.040
I'm glad that she's here.

07:41.080 --> 07:43.210
I'm surprised
she's not working.

07:43.250 --> 07:44.750
I'm kidding.

07:44.780 --> 07:48.450
No, that's- that's good
that she's here.

07:48.490 --> 07:50.280
And don't worry, everything
will be cool between us.

07:50.320 --> 07:51.250
Solemn promise?

07:51.290 --> 07:52.790
Ava, we dated a lifetime ago.

07:52.820 --> 07:55.620
Two lifetimes ago.

07:55.660 --> 07:57.590
At least that's what
it felt like.

07:57.630 --> 07:58.890
Hi Lacey.

07:58.930 --> 08:01.460
Hi Ean.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.700
Well, you look just like
I would imagine

08:03.730 --> 08:06.430
a big city designer to look.

08:06.470 --> 08:10.100
And you're very
backpacker chic.

08:10.140 --> 08:11.640
This is kinda
the standard uniform

08:11.670 --> 08:14.640
for us culinary explorers.

08:14.680 --> 08:15.980
Of course.

08:16.010 --> 08:18.810
I didn't know that was
an official career.

08:18.850 --> 08:20.450
Official, no.

08:20.480 --> 08:21.980
But you know better
than most,

08:22.020 --> 08:25.290
I've never been a fan of
official titles.

08:25.320 --> 08:28.820
Yeah, I know that very well.

08:28.860 --> 08:30.490
Hey all.

08:30.530 --> 08:31.130
Hi!

08:31.160 --> 08:31.830
Welcome.

08:31.860 --> 08:34.059
Hey.

08:34.100 --> 08:37.130
Hey, buddy.

08:37.169 --> 08:39.000
Mason, honey, good timing.

08:39.039 --> 08:41.299
Um, why don't you help Ean
get settled in

08:41.340 --> 08:44.510
and Lacey and I will go
up to the cottage.

08:44.540 --> 08:45.340
Great.

08:45.380 --> 08:46.610
OK.

08:46.640 --> 08:49.140
See you all later.

08:49.180 --> 08:50.010
<i> Have fun.</i>

08:50.050 --> 08:50.650
Bye.

08:50.680 --> 08:51.580
<i> See you all later. </i>

08:51.610 --> 08:53.380
[laughs]

08:55.820 --> 08:57.420
<i> It's been so long.</i>

08:57.450 --> 09:00.320
<i> Yep, still looks the same. </i>

09:00.360 --> 09:01.760
<i> Probably the same</i>
<i> when Ean's saw it too.</i>

09:01.790 --> 09:03.860
<i> Can you believe</i>
<i> that we're back here?</i>

09:03.890 --> 09:07.060
<i> You ready?</i>
<i> Alright, let's go.</i>

09:16.370 --> 09:18.040
Remember when we used
to pretend this place

09:18.070 --> 09:20.940
was an enchanted castle?

09:20.980 --> 09:22.680
Of course.

09:22.710 --> 09:25.010
Forks and spoons were wands,

09:25.050 --> 09:27.720
the glasses were
magical crystals.

09:27.750 --> 09:30.220
I still think this place
is enchanted.

09:30.250 --> 09:33.450
There's magic here at Christmas,
I can feel it.

09:33.490 --> 09:35.190
You know, anyone
who's ever stayed here

09:35.220 --> 09:38.360
during Christmas time
has found true love.

09:38.390 --> 09:39.990
Don't you think that's
a myth?

09:40.030 --> 09:42.500
Well, it's been in my family
for generations

09:42.530 --> 09:46.470
and it's been proven right
for generations.

09:46.500 --> 09:50.970
<i> My great-grandmother pretended</i>
<i> that she wasn't</i>

09:51.010 --> 09:55.040
absolutely in love
with my great-grandfather.

09:55.080 --> 09:57.850
<i> And so they spent the night</i>
<i> here one Christmas</i>

09:57.880 --> 10:01.180
and then they woke to find
that they were deeply in love

10:01.220 --> 10:03.020
and they spent the rest
of their lives that way.

10:03.050 --> 10:05.820
And then my grandparents
spent their wedding night here,

10:05.860 --> 10:07.050
same thing.

10:07.090 --> 10:08.720
And then you know how loving

10:08.760 --> 10:10.990
and wonderful Aunt Sarah's
marriage was.

10:11.030 --> 10:12.660
They were happy every day
they spent together.

10:12.700 --> 10:17.400
Soon Mason and I will find
that same magical happiness.

10:20.240 --> 10:22.700
Is that why you chose this place
for your honeymoon

10:22.740 --> 10:25.940
instead of, say, Hawaii
or Greece or Tahiti?

10:25.980 --> 10:27.510
You can tease me
all you want.

10:27.540 --> 10:31.210
I still believe it
and you used to, too.

10:34.650 --> 10:36.420
Remember when we would
run around here with towels

10:36.450 --> 10:39.520
on our heads pretending
we were brides?

10:39.560 --> 10:40.760
Until Ean made fun of us.

10:40.790 --> 10:42.960
That was so long ago.

10:42.990 --> 10:44.190
It's great that you
still believe it.

10:44.230 --> 10:46.590
And it's sweet of you to offer
to get it all set up for us.

10:46.630 --> 10:47.460
Are you kidding?

10:47.500 --> 10:48.700
Design is my speciality.

10:48.730 --> 10:50.300
Still, thanks for stepping in.

10:50.330 --> 10:52.100
With all of the wedding stuff
coming up

10:52.140 --> 10:53.870
I don't even have time to think
about getting this place

10:53.900 --> 10:57.140
spruced up and I want it
to look perfect.

10:57.170 --> 10:58.010
I'm way ahead of you.

10:58.040 --> 10:59.370
I ordered all the decorations
online

10:59.410 --> 11:00.640
with overnight shipping,

11:00.680 --> 11:02.780
it'll be here tomorrow and then
all I have to do is set it up.

11:02.810 --> 11:05.150
I even got this super cool
mid-century modern tree.

11:05.180 --> 11:06.980
OK, time out.

11:07.020 --> 11:08.480
You ordered a tree?

11:08.520 --> 11:09.420
Yeah.

11:09.450 --> 11:10.790
It's- it's very retro-chic.

11:10.820 --> 11:13.150
Lacey, I don't want
a retro-chic tree.

11:13.190 --> 11:14.560
I want a big pine tree.

11:14.590 --> 11:16.920
You know, the kind
that you cut down?

11:16.960 --> 11:18.390
You want me to cut down
a tree.

11:18.430 --> 11:20.660
Uh, that's- that's a little more
time consuming.

11:20.700 --> 11:22.830
I want this place to just be
bursting with Christmas.

11:22.870 --> 11:25.400
With a few designer flourishes,
right?

11:25.440 --> 11:26.270
I mean, I do have
a theme picked out.

11:26.300 --> 11:27.970
Just make sure it feels
like Christmas.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.800
The ones we used
to spend here.

11:29.840 --> 11:30.740
OK.

11:30.770 --> 11:31.940
Anyways, we should
get back to the hotel

11:31.970 --> 11:33.240
so that you can
get changed

11:33.280 --> 11:34.910
into your party gear
for the welcome party.

11:34.940 --> 11:36.480
Uh, this is my party gear.

11:36.510 --> 11:38.950
But it's... it's so grey.

11:38.980 --> 11:41.250
And sleek and sophisticated.

11:41.280 --> 11:42.520
This is all I own.

11:42.550 --> 11:43.980
OK, you've become
one of your designs.

11:44.020 --> 11:46.750
We need to get colour back
into your life asap.

11:50.630 --> 11:52.890
[phone ringing]

11:55.000 --> 11:55.700
Hi.

11:55.730 --> 11:56.360
Hey.

11:56.400 --> 11:57.430
How are the designs coming?

11:57.470 --> 11:58.400
Uh, great.

11:58.430 --> 12:00.530
I blocked out 4pm on tonight
to finish up.

12:00.570 --> 12:01.670
That's fantastic.

12:01.700 --> 12:02.400
I'm almost done
with the budget.

12:02.440 --> 12:03.170
How's everything
at the wedding?

12:03.210 --> 12:04.170
It's great.

12:04.210 --> 12:05.010
It's really nice
to see everyone.

12:05.040 --> 12:06.110
<i> Great.</i>

12:06.140 --> 12:07.110
<i> Well, I'm working like crazy</i>
<i> over here.</i>

12:07.140 --> 12:07.840
I just wanna make sure
that all the materials

12:07.880 --> 12:08.840
are available so we can
dive in.

12:08.880 --> 12:12.550
If we get this we can line up
work for years.

12:12.580 --> 12:13.780
Fingers crossed.

12:13.820 --> 12:14.550
OK.

12:14.580 --> 12:15.550
What about-

12:15.590 --> 12:17.150
Have fun.

12:31.570 --> 12:32.230
Hi.

12:32.270 --> 12:33.400
Hi.

12:33.440 --> 12:35.200
So, how are you?

12:35.240 --> 12:36.240
Uh, good.

12:36.270 --> 12:37.340
You?

12:37.370 --> 12:39.570
Fantastic, yeah.

12:39.610 --> 12:42.740
Um, Ava tells me you're
seeing someone.

12:42.780 --> 12:44.250
That's- that's great.

12:44.280 --> 12:44.910
What's his-

12:44.950 --> 12:46.050
Awesome.

12:46.080 --> 12:47.410
Great. Amazing.

12:47.450 --> 12:48.880
I was gonna ask his name.

12:48.920 --> 12:50.080
Oh.

12:50.120 --> 12:52.050
Um, Roger.

12:52.090 --> 12:54.320
Roger.

12:54.360 --> 12:56.390
Didn't you have like a gerbil
or something named-

12:56.430 --> 12:57.190
Robert.

12:57.230 --> 12:58.090
It was a hamster.

12:58.130 --> 12:59.530
That's right, I remember.

12:59.560 --> 13:01.060
You used to build him
these little houses

13:01.100 --> 13:05.100
with beds and cute windows.

13:05.130 --> 13:07.230
You were designing even then.

13:07.740 --> 13:09.170
So things are good
with this guy?

13:09.210 --> 13:09.900
Close to perfect.

13:09.940 --> 13:11.540
We work together
so it's easy.

13:11.570 --> 13:12.870
We know each other
really well.

13:12.910 --> 13:15.780
He's really focused on work.

13:15.810 --> 13:16.540
Well, that's good.

13:16.580 --> 13:17.550
You always made work
a priority

13:17.580 --> 13:19.350
so it's good you found someone
who does, too.

13:19.380 --> 13:20.080
It's great.

13:20.120 --> 13:21.920
Really great.

13:25.420 --> 13:29.090
I guess it's a choice.

13:29.130 --> 13:31.760
You know, some people choose
to prioritize work

13:31.790 --> 13:34.060
and some people choose to
prioritize relationships.

13:34.100 --> 13:35.360
I prioritize both.

13:35.400 --> 13:36.730
Yeah, I'm just thinking
out loud.

13:36.770 --> 13:38.270
You know, I just think that,
in general,

13:38.300 --> 13:41.200
people who prioritize
relationships are happier.

13:41.240 --> 13:43.770
Well, in general, it's hard
to prioritize a relationship

13:43.810 --> 13:45.740
when people are so unreliable.

13:45.780 --> 13:46.870
I totally agree.

13:46.910 --> 13:49.310
By unreliable do you mean
not content to sit around

13:49.350 --> 13:50.640
and wait for their
significant other

13:50.680 --> 13:51.980
to pay attention to them?

13:52.010 --> 13:52.980
By unreliable I mean someone
who, you know,

13:53.020 --> 13:54.580
bolts halfway around the world
when he feels

13:54.620 --> 13:56.750
he's not the sole focus
of your life.

13:59.960 --> 14:02.160
I never asked to be the sole
focus of your life, Lacey.

14:02.190 --> 14:03.790
I would have taken less.

14:03.830 --> 14:06.790
But sometimes it felt like
you couldn't even give me that.

14:06.830 --> 14:08.660
So I'm glad you found
someone who sees relationships

14:08.700 --> 14:10.560
the way you do.

14:19.480 --> 14:21.240
[deep sigh]

14:25.450 --> 14:27.510
[clink]

14:27.550 --> 14:32.590
[indistinct chatter]

14:34.620 --> 14:36.360
Oh, darling, you look radiant.

14:36.390 --> 14:39.190
Awe, thanks, mom.

14:39.230 --> 14:40.360
Well, hello.

14:40.400 --> 14:41.100
[gasps]

14:41.130 --> 14:42.100
Aunt Sarah, hi!

14:42.130 --> 14:43.600
Oh, you look beautiful.

14:43.630 --> 14:45.170
Oh, thank you.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.830
Uh, may I say a word or two?

14:46.870 --> 14:47.800
Of course.

14:47.840 --> 14:51.370
You are the hostess
of the welcome party.

14:51.410 --> 14:53.770
[clinks glass]

14:55.040 --> 14:58.050
[clears throat]

14:58.080 --> 15:00.110
First of all I want
to welcome you

15:00.150 --> 15:02.850
and thank you all for travelling
here during Christmas.

15:02.890 --> 15:05.720
It's a tradition in our family
to get married on Christmas Eve

15:05.760 --> 15:09.220
and to spend their honeymoon
in the family cottage.

15:09.260 --> 15:13.690
It brings happiness and good
fortune to the couple.

15:13.730 --> 15:15.960
It's kind of like a family myth.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.900
Some believe it,
some don't.

15:17.930 --> 15:20.130
I'm a believer.

15:20.170 --> 15:23.040
I had a wonderful marriage
for 34 years

15:23.070 --> 15:25.310
and, although George
is no longer with us,

15:25.340 --> 15:27.910
I feel his love every day.

15:27.940 --> 15:31.180
Like me, Ava has always believed
in the magic of Christmas.

15:31.210 --> 15:33.410
Maybe it's because she watched
"It's a Wonderful Life"

15:33.450 --> 15:34.210
too many times.

15:34.250 --> 15:38.220
[laughing]

15:38.250 --> 15:41.090
To Ava and Mason.

15:41.120 --> 15:42.190
May the joy of
the Christmas season

15:42.220 --> 15:45.160
live in your marriage forever
and in your hearts.

15:45.190 --> 15:46.830
Cheers.

15:59.310 --> 16:01.240
I'll send over the rough specs
for the lighting fixtures

16:01.280 --> 16:02.840
in an hour, and I'll upload
a premium rendering

16:02.880 --> 16:04.280
to DropBox and-

16:04.310 --> 16:06.510
Lacey, dear, can we have
a little talk?

16:06.550 --> 16:07.880
In some place a little
more quiet.

16:07.920 --> 16:08.780
Sure.

16:08.820 --> 16:09.880
Uh, I'll call you back.

16:09.920 --> 16:10.380
Good.

16:10.420 --> 16:12.020
Let's go in here.

16:17.430 --> 16:19.530
You know how special
the cottage is.

16:19.560 --> 16:21.400
Ava says that you're gonna
help decorate.

16:21.430 --> 16:22.260
Yes.

16:22.300 --> 16:22.900
That is so sweet of you
to take that on

16:22.930 --> 16:24.700
given your tight schedule.

16:24.730 --> 16:25.630
Anything for Ava.

16:25.670 --> 16:28.240
Well, just remember,
it's the traditions.

16:28.270 --> 16:29.400
Traditions, yes.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.610
I have it all figured out.

16:31.640 --> 16:32.670
I ordered these online.

16:32.710 --> 16:35.280
Fifteen strands of twinkle
lights and ornaments.

16:35.310 --> 16:35.910
They're gonna be amazing.

16:35.950 --> 16:37.280
They come in a pure white.

16:37.310 --> 16:38.210
A bit minimalist.

16:38.250 --> 16:40.080
They're different.

16:40.120 --> 16:40.650
And bright.

16:40.680 --> 16:42.880
But not very colourful.

16:42.920 --> 16:47.450
Just remember,
Ava loves Christmas.

16:47.490 --> 16:49.290
Of course.

16:53.330 --> 16:55.460
Lacey.

16:55.500 --> 16:57.630
Don't escape to your work
just yet.

16:57.670 --> 16:59.930
I'm beginning to think
that might be impossible.

16:59.970 --> 17:01.440
The key to the cottage.

17:01.470 --> 17:02.440
Have fun decorating.

17:02.470 --> 17:05.140
And think Christmas.

17:06.140 --> 17:08.440
I'm going first thing
in the morning.

17:37.970 --> 17:39.010
What're you doing here?

17:39.040 --> 17:40.370
I'm here to help.

17:40.410 --> 17:41.140
I don't need your help.

17:41.180 --> 17:41.940
Ava asked me to-

17:41.980 --> 17:43.310
Decorate, I know.

17:43.350 --> 17:45.280
But Mason asked me
to help

17:45.310 --> 17:47.980
and I can't relinquish my best
man duties.

17:48.020 --> 17:50.650
So where do we begin?

18:03.100 --> 18:04.630
Alright.

18:04.670 --> 18:06.500
So the best trees
are towards the back.

18:06.540 --> 18:08.300
The trees in the barn
are pre-cut.

18:08.340 --> 18:09.000
Let's just pick out
one of those,

18:09.040 --> 18:09.970
bring it back to the cottage,

18:10.010 --> 18:11.410
decorate it, then I can get back
to the hotel

18:11.440 --> 18:13.140
and have plenty of time to work.

18:13.180 --> 18:14.410
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to pull

18:14.440 --> 18:17.380
Callaghan family rank
on you here, Lacey.

18:17.410 --> 18:20.010
It's tradition to cut down
our own tree.

18:20.050 --> 18:21.820
I'm sure Ava would agree.

18:21.850 --> 18:23.050
[sighs]

18:23.090 --> 18:24.720
Fine.

18:26.420 --> 18:28.920
I can handle the tree if you
need to return business calls.

18:28.960 --> 18:30.060
I'm not returning calls.

18:30.090 --> 18:31.930
I'm setting a timer
for when we need

18:31.960 --> 18:33.230
to be finished at the cottage.

18:33.260 --> 18:35.230
Very efficient of you.

18:35.260 --> 18:37.970
And I'm looking up how to best
chop down a Christmas tree.

18:41.470 --> 18:43.400
Seriously, Lacey, I got this.

18:43.440 --> 18:44.200
No.

18:44.240 --> 18:45.240
Why not?

18:45.270 --> 18:47.540
Because you're gonna choose
some misshapen...

18:47.580 --> 18:48.540
Original.

18:48.580 --> 18:49.280
Unique.

18:49.310 --> 18:50.580
Asymmetrical.

18:50.610 --> 18:52.080
Non-conformist.

18:52.110 --> 18:53.450
A little on the wild side.

18:53.480 --> 18:54.410
Shrub.

18:54.450 --> 18:55.080
[gasps]

18:55.120 --> 18:57.350
That's a low blow, you know.

18:57.390 --> 18:59.590
I just want it to be perfect
for Ava.

18:59.620 --> 19:01.790
Well, you know
what they say.

19:01.820 --> 19:03.520
If you want something
done right...

19:03.560 --> 19:06.030
You pick a tree
and I'll start sawing.

19:07.130 --> 19:07.900
This one.

19:07.930 --> 19:09.360
It's perfect.

19:09.400 --> 19:11.400
And I'll do the sawing.

19:11.430 --> 19:13.970
This e-how video
got five stars.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.770
Cutting down a tree
in two minutes flat.

19:16.810 --> 19:19.410
You are nothing
if not efficient.

19:22.080 --> 19:22.940
Are you sure you
don't want my help?

19:22.980 --> 19:23.940
Positive.

19:23.980 --> 19:25.310
Because I'm pretty good
at this kind of thing.

19:25.350 --> 19:26.880
I'm on a schedule here,
Ean.

19:26.920 --> 19:28.480
What's your schedule
for this tree?

19:28.520 --> 19:30.480
Well, it should be down
in a few seconds

19:30.520 --> 19:32.120
and we'll take it home
and decorate it-

19:32.150 --> 19:33.290
Lacey, the tree's about to fall.

19:33.320 --> 19:34.490
I told you my method
was efficient.

19:34.520 --> 19:36.760
No, it's about to fall
on you.

19:36.790 --> 19:38.430
[yelps]

19:41.760 --> 19:47.900
Uh, well, now that it's down
what do we do with it?

19:47.940 --> 19:49.940
You sure you don't wanna
YouTube it?

19:55.640 --> 19:57.910
OK, let's pick up some firewood
while we're here,

19:57.950 --> 19:58.980
take it back and decorate it.

19:59.010 --> 20:00.410
Let's get some food first.

20:00.450 --> 20:02.080
We don't have time to eat,
Ean.

20:02.120 --> 20:04.520
It's not for us, it's for Ava
and Mason at the cottage.

20:04.550 --> 20:06.420
Believe it or not, most
human beings can't survive

20:06.460 --> 20:09.020
on ambition alone.

20:20.300 --> 20:22.640
OK, let's dive in.

20:22.670 --> 20:23.770
We have a lot of work to do.

20:23.810 --> 20:26.310
Hey, we'll get it done
before the day of the wedding.

20:26.340 --> 20:29.310
I was hoping we'd have it done
in a couple hours.

20:29.350 --> 20:30.580
I have to work.

20:30.610 --> 20:33.450
I'll put the food away if you
can put the Christmas tree up.

20:33.480 --> 20:35.150
Deal.

21:20.500 --> 21:21.460
Woah, what's that?

21:21.500 --> 21:22.800
Christmas lights.

21:22.830 --> 21:24.500
In pure white.

21:24.530 --> 21:26.000
It's a clean, bright look.

21:26.040 --> 21:28.240
It's supposed to suggest
a forest.

21:28.270 --> 21:31.040
Hmm.

21:31.070 --> 21:32.570
Kinda bland,
don't you think?

21:32.610 --> 21:33.710
Just plain white?

21:33.740 --> 21:36.010
I have a vision of a brightly
lit winter wonderland.

21:36.050 --> 21:37.280
Oh no.

21:37.310 --> 21:40.580
I vaguely recall you having a
vision of a toboggan one winter

21:40.620 --> 21:42.720
that required me to duct tape
two cookie sheets

21:42.750 --> 21:44.380
and a roasting pan together.

21:44.420 --> 21:47.320
In other words, your vision
means my labour.

21:47.360 --> 21:48.590
And this looks like
it's gonna require

21:48.620 --> 21:50.060
a lot of extension cords.

21:50.090 --> 21:51.360
Nope, no, I got it.

21:51.390 --> 21:52.090
Please.

21:52.130 --> 21:55.430
Spare me the e-how
this time.

21:55.460 --> 21:57.400
I'll get the cords.

22:21.960 --> 22:24.420
Oh, yeah.

22:24.460 --> 22:26.460
This place could use
a freshening up.

22:26.500 --> 22:28.200
It doesn't get used
as much as it used to.

22:28.230 --> 22:29.000
Yeah.

22:29.030 --> 22:30.430
And I don't think
you should start

22:30.470 --> 22:32.070
a married life surrounded
by dust.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.070
No, I'll tell you what.

22:33.100 --> 22:34.940
I will turn on the water
to clear all the pipes

22:34.970 --> 22:36.970
and then we should clean
the fireplace.

22:37.010 --> 22:37.740
OK.

22:37.770 --> 22:38.770
OK.

23:04.700 --> 23:05.570
What...

23:05.600 --> 23:06.430
I opened the flue.

23:06.470 --> 23:07.600
I...

23:07.640 --> 23:09.740
Oh, Lacey.

23:09.770 --> 23:10.540
Don't you remember

23:10.570 --> 23:11.940
that thing's been broken
for years.

23:11.970 --> 23:13.170
I can't believe I did this.

23:13.210 --> 23:14.140
Hey, it's OK.

23:14.180 --> 23:16.740
I will handle this mess
while you clean up,

23:16.780 --> 23:19.250
and then we'll decorate,
alright?

23:19.280 --> 23:20.010
OK.

23:20.050 --> 23:22.080
Thank you.

23:51.080 --> 23:52.850
I can't reach.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.400
It's perfect.

24:08.430 --> 24:10.960
Not yet.

24:11.770 --> 24:12.800
What are those?

24:12.840 --> 24:14.000
Christmas ornaments.

24:14.040 --> 24:15.740
Old family Christmas ornaments.

24:15.770 --> 24:17.300
Ean, the tree's
already done.

24:17.340 --> 24:18.470
The colours are perfect.

24:18.510 --> 24:19.810
There are no colours.

24:19.840 --> 24:21.410
Well, technically there are.

24:21.440 --> 24:24.380
There's eggshell and Chantilly
and solar.

24:24.410 --> 24:25.550
That's so boring.

24:25.580 --> 24:27.810
You say boring, I say
sophisticated.

24:27.850 --> 24:30.920
Lacey, these ornaments
mean something to my family.

24:30.950 --> 24:31.890
We keep them up here
so we can put them

24:31.920 --> 24:33.990
on the Christmas cottage tree
every year.

24:34.020 --> 24:36.690
OK, can't you just cede to
my expertise this one time?

24:36.730 --> 24:38.330
Honestly, Ean, people pay me
a lot of money

24:38.360 --> 24:39.430
for my design sense.

24:39.460 --> 24:40.330
For my vision.

24:40.360 --> 24:41.500
OK. OK.

24:41.530 --> 24:43.200
But this place
is about tradition.

24:43.230 --> 24:50.740
It's about memories and family
and warmth and connection.

24:50.770 --> 24:52.410
Besides, this is about Ava
and what she wants

24:52.440 --> 24:53.670
and I'm pretty sure if she was
given the choice

24:53.710 --> 24:56.240
between Christmas elegance

24:56.280 --> 25:00.380
and Christmas explosion
she would probably choose...

25:00.420 --> 25:02.080
Christmas explosion.

25:02.120 --> 25:03.720
Fine, fine,
we'll put up a few.

25:03.750 --> 25:04.580
For Ava.

25:04.620 --> 25:05.790
Great.

25:05.820 --> 25:10.420
OK, let's start with...
this guy.

25:16.900 --> 25:18.400
Well, there's snow
in the forecast.

25:18.430 --> 25:20.300
Looks like you're gonna get
your white Christmas.

25:20.340 --> 25:21.370
That's so great.

25:21.400 --> 25:23.770
Oh, I should text Lacey though
and let her know.

25:23.810 --> 25:25.140
Those roads can
get pretty slippery.

25:25.170 --> 25:26.510
Good idea.

25:49.260 --> 25:50.060
Look.

25:50.100 --> 25:52.270
Our first Christmas
at the cottage.

25:52.300 --> 25:57.070
Awe, that was so fun.

25:57.110 --> 25:58.940
You should probably put it back
in the box.

25:58.970 --> 26:02.410
It might be awkward having it
on the tree.

26:02.440 --> 26:05.880
Yeah, I just thought
you might like to see it.

26:07.020 --> 26:09.450
Well, design school sure
paid off for you.

26:09.480 --> 26:12.150
Uh, speaking of, I should
get back to the hotel.

26:12.190 --> 26:13.720
I have some drawings
that are due tonight.

Looks like we're getting out
of here just in time.

26:31.370 --> 26:33.610
Uh, actually we're not.

26:33.640 --> 26:36.940
Uh, what does that mean?

26:38.250 --> 26:40.950
It means we're snowed in.

26:42.080 --> 26:44.480
No.

26:44.520 --> 26:46.850
Looks like we're spending
the night here tonight.

26:55.130 --> 26:56.730
There's gotta be an open
road somewhere.

26:56.770 --> 26:57.760
I need to get to my computer.

26:57.800 --> 26:59.730
Lacey, there's only one road
up to the cottage.

26:59.770 --> 27:01.670
Look, hopefully the roads
will be open in the morning

27:01.700 --> 27:04.040
but there's nothing we can
do about it so let's just relax.

27:04.070 --> 27:07.040
But I blocked out this time
to work.

27:12.380 --> 27:13.580
Ah.

27:15.980 --> 27:17.950
So then work.

27:17.990 --> 27:19.850

27:23.960 --> 27:25.460
I can't get the blueprints
in tonight.

27:25.490 --> 27:27.260
Kinda like you're stressing
right now?

are a good pair.

Or, rather, where are you?

It looks like you're standing
in a closet.

27:43.250 --> 27:44.140
Oh, I'm at the cottage.

27:44.180 --> 27:44.980

27:45.010 --> 27:46.480
It's- it's been in Ava's
family for-

27:46.520 --> 27:47.650
Oh, right. Right.

Hey, how are the uh,
designs coming?

27:49.950 --> 27:50.680
They look good.

27:50.720 --> 27:52.090
They should be done
soon and-

Now do you see why I need
to get to my laptop?

28:04.600 --> 28:06.670
I have to have these designs
in before the wedding.

My whole firm's future
is riding on this.

that but what I can say is

28:12.140 --> 28:14.310
that freaking out about it
while you're snowed in

28:14.340 --> 28:15.440
isn't gonna help.

28:15.480 --> 28:16.780
Let's just try to relax.

28:16.810 --> 28:18.210
I found these extra pyjamas.

28:18.250 --> 28:19.650
Go put those on.

the best of it.

29:12.530 --> 29:16.570

the truth?

29:16.610 --> 29:18.170
That we're stranded
in a blizzard

29:18.210 --> 29:19.040

employed for years.

29:27.820 --> 29:29.720
It's a new housing development.

29:29.750 --> 29:30.680
I designed a concept house

29:30.720 --> 29:32.350
that we were hoping
they'd buy and build.

for the firm.

between professional space

29:47.400 --> 29:48.800

You know, I was just thinking
the same thing.

30:47.200 --> 30:51.870

a fire in the rain.

Do you also remember fishing
for our dinner

30:54.800 --> 30:56.800

30:56.840 --> 30:57.640

the craziest, coldest,

vacations I ever took.

taken that trip I planned for us

31:12.050 --> 31:13.290
to the Caribbean.

for months to earn enough and-

31:15.560 --> 31:18.690
I had to cancel because I got
a summer internship

31:18.730 --> 31:19.990
in New York.

31:20.030 --> 31:21.460
Yeah.

31:21.500 --> 31:25.700
I was disappointed, but I
supported your decision.

31:30.170 --> 31:32.370
I'm sorry if I made you feel bad
about taking that internship.

down in one job

in one place for
the rest of my life.

31:45.350 --> 31:48.090
I know.

31:48.120 --> 31:50.660
It was pretty apparent
when you accepted a job

31:50.690 --> 31:54.360
3,000 miles away without even
telling me you applied for it.

31:54.400 --> 31:57.160
We just wanted
different things, Ean.

31:58.970 --> 32:01.300

32:55.690 --> 32:57.960
Oh, hey.

32:57.990 --> 32:59.560
Uh, the power came back on.

32:59.590 --> 33:01.560
Just in time for the most
important meal of the day.

33:01.600 --> 33:02.760
Mmm.

33:02.800 --> 33:05.500
I haven't had an Ean Callaghan
breakfast in a long time.

33:05.530 --> 33:08.570
Well, then prepare
to be amazed.

33:15.040 --> 33:16.780
Yum.

33:20.150 --> 33:21.910
Looks great.

33:24.020 --> 33:25.690
You always knew the way
to a woman's heart

33:25.720 --> 33:27.590
was through her taste buds.

33:27.620 --> 33:31.260
Well, that is the real reason
I became a chef.

33:31.290 --> 33:34.260
It was a shameless way
to impress the ladies.

33:34.900 --> 33:35.830
Well, it worked.

33:35.860 --> 33:37.560
Oh.

33:38.630 --> 33:39.770
Mmm.

33:39.800 --> 33:40.600
Mmmhmm.

33:40.640 --> 33:42.370
I am amazed.

33:42.400 --> 33:43.940
I'll never understand
why you didn't take the job

33:43.970 --> 33:45.610
at Les Bernadette.

33:45.640 --> 33:47.140
It was a three-star restaurant.

33:47.180 --> 33:48.670
I was young.

33:48.710 --> 33:49.910
I had wanderlust.

33:49.940 --> 33:52.680
I believed that any true chef
needed to go to these places

33:52.710 --> 33:54.980
where various cuisines
were developed.

33:55.020 --> 33:57.020
In order to understand the food
you need to understand

33:57.050 --> 33:57.880
the culture.

33:57.920 --> 33:59.950
I remember such grand
pronouncements.

33:59.990 --> 34:04.520
But now making a meal
for one single appreciative--

34:04.560 --> 34:07.160
Wildly appreciative.

34:07.200 --> 34:12.370
--person, feels pretty
great, too.

34:12.699 --> 34:13.900
Uh, do you want some coffee?

34:13.940 --> 34:14.600
Yeah.

34:14.639 --> 34:16.969
Consider it my Christmas blend.

34:22.010 --> 34:25.010
[gasps]
Oh, no, no, no, no!

34:27.880 --> 34:29.380
[giggling]

34:39.960 --> 34:43.030
Uh, we should probably
get going.

34:43.060 --> 34:43.860
We have our dress fittings.

34:43.900 --> 34:45.159
Right.

34:45.199 --> 34:47.070
And Ava will freak
if we're late.

34:47.100 --> 34:48.770
Um, I thought I heard some
ploughs last night

34:48.800 --> 34:50.570
so the roads should be clear.

34:52.310 --> 34:53.270
Eat up.

34:53.310 --> 34:55.880
We'll get you back to
the lodge in no time.

35:09.990 --> 35:11.460
Oh my gosh!

35:11.490 --> 35:14.730
You look so beautiful.

35:14.760 --> 35:15.830
Doesn't she look great?

35:15.860 --> 35:17.330
It looks great.

35:17.370 --> 35:19.000
OK, are you ready?

35:19.030 --> 35:21.030
Yeah.

35:27.110 --> 35:30.280
I'm so sorry that happened
to you.

35:30.310 --> 35:31.780
Was it horribly awkward?

35:31.810 --> 35:32.810
Was what awkward?

35:32.850 --> 35:34.610
Being stuck with Ean
all night?

35:34.650 --> 35:35.480
No, no.

35:35.520 --> 35:36.280
It was fine.

35:36.320 --> 35:37.350
It was fun, even.

35:37.390 --> 35:38.320
Hmm.

35:38.350 --> 35:40.690
OK, I know you've been dreading
this moment

35:40.720 --> 35:43.790
and that bright colour
isn't your thing, but...

35:48.060 --> 35:49.760
[gasps]

35:49.800 --> 35:51.130
I like it.

35:51.170 --> 35:53.430
Really?

35:53.470 --> 35:55.500
Actually, I love it.

35:55.540 --> 35:57.340
Good!

35:58.670 --> 36:00.210
What is going on with you?

36:00.240 --> 36:01.010
What do you mean?

36:01.040 --> 36:03.840
You just seem so happy
and light.

36:03.880 --> 36:04.880
It's Christmas.

36:04.910 --> 36:05.950
It's your wedding.

36:05.980 --> 36:08.780
What's not to be happy about?

36:08.820 --> 36:11.480
OK, try it on.

36:12.590 --> 36:13.520
It looks really good.

36:13.560 --> 36:14.050
Yeah.

36:14.090 --> 36:16.290
Yeah, it's perfect.

36:18.390 --> 36:19.560
[squeals]
Ooh, I'm so excited!

36:19.590 --> 36:21.490
You look so handsome.

36:22.430 --> 36:25.870
<i> Ah, I'm so happy that they did</i>
<i>such a good job tailoring this.</i>

36:31.840 --> 36:35.040
Please tell me I don't look
silly in this dress.

36:35.080 --> 36:35.810
Are you kidding me?

36:35.840 --> 36:36.980
You look gorgeous.

36:37.010 --> 36:40.080
[laughs]

36:40.110 --> 36:42.420
I never did learn
how to tie these.

36:42.450 --> 36:44.150
Neither could my dad.

36:44.190 --> 36:46.190
Fortunately, I got
quite good at it.

36:46.220 --> 36:48.890
I've been doing it for him
since I was ten.

36:48.920 --> 36:50.060
Really?

36:50.090 --> 36:51.060
Mmmhmm.

36:51.090 --> 36:52.490
Huh.

36:54.200 --> 36:55.390
Mason.

36:57.230 --> 36:59.770
Do you see what I see?

36:59.800 --> 37:00.770
Lacey and Ean.

37:00.800 --> 37:02.570
They look so happy.

37:02.600 --> 37:04.200
They do.

37:05.270 --> 37:07.870
[giggles]

37:09.980 --> 37:11.580
So, as you all know,

37:11.610 --> 37:13.780
when Mason and I do our
first dance together

37:13.820 --> 37:15.750
we'd like for all of you
to join us.

37:15.780 --> 37:18.350
We'll dance in the centre
and then we'll first be joined

37:18.390 --> 37:21.090
by the maid of honour
and our best man.

37:21.120 --> 37:23.520
And then the rest of you
will circle around us.

37:23.560 --> 37:24.420
Should we give it a try?

37:24.460 --> 37:25.360
Yeah.

37:25.390 --> 37:27.160
OK.

37:28.400 --> 37:31.860

Good job, honey.

37:38.740 --> 37:40.570
Thank you.

Oof!

OK.

38:01.930 --> 38:04.630
[clapping]

38:07.040 --> 38:09.570
I've never seen a more perfect
pair on the dance floor.

38:09.600 --> 38:11.570
You guys are good.

38:13.810 --> 38:15.940
Sorry to steal you away
from the fun.

38:15.980 --> 38:17.580
I'm happy to be stolen.

38:17.610 --> 38:19.850
I miss talking to you.

38:19.880 --> 38:21.280
Me too.

38:21.320 --> 38:22.420
You know, I don't get to travel
very much anymore

38:22.480 --> 38:26.020
but I still love to hear about
life in San Francisco.

38:26.050 --> 38:29.190
I think you might still have
some big city partying in you.

38:29.220 --> 38:34.360
Oh, I realized a long time ago
where my home was.

38:34.400 --> 38:36.230
It's a gift.

38:36.260 --> 38:37.760
To know where you belong
and with whom.

38:37.800 --> 38:39.430
You're talking about Roger?

38:39.470 --> 38:41.200
[laughs]

38:41.240 --> 38:44.240
So, is that where
you belong?

38:44.270 --> 38:48.440
With this new boyfriend,
in San Francisco?

38:48.480 --> 38:51.110
Yeah, I think it is.

38:51.150 --> 38:53.450
Well, that's wonderful,
Lacey.

38:53.480 --> 38:56.120
But, you know, coming back here
makes me think about

38:56.150 --> 38:59.120
different things.

38:59.150 --> 39:00.950
Different paths I might
have taken.

39:00.990 --> 39:03.060
There's something about
Christmas that always makes

39:03.090 --> 39:04.960
people re-examine their lives.

39:04.990 --> 39:07.060
Why is that?

39:07.100 --> 39:09.300
Human nature, I guess.

39:09.330 --> 39:10.860
We get to see the choices
other people made

39:10.900 --> 39:13.130
and wonder if we're going down
the right path.

39:13.170 --> 39:15.630
But I will tell you this.

39:15.670 --> 39:18.700
When someone has a genuine
smile on her face

39:18.740 --> 39:21.910
that's usually a good sign
that she's on the right path.

39:31.990 --> 39:33.690

Can I come in?

39:43.000 --> 39:44.200
Yes.

OK, I've known you too long.

that busy mind of yours?

39:54.010 --> 39:57.980

or be insensitive

39:58.010 --> 40:01.780
to your relationship
with Roger in any way.

You and Ean.

40:03.150 --> 40:04.480
Don't deny it.

40:04.520 --> 40:06.190
I was there when you guys
were together

40:06.220 --> 40:09.320
and that's exactly what
it looked like today.

40:09.360 --> 40:12.530
Look, it's really nice
to see him again

40:12.560 --> 40:14.490
and we're actually having more
fun than I thought we would.

40:14.530 --> 40:15.860
I guess the Christmas
cottage myth

40:15.900 --> 40:17.500
isn't as loony as you thought.

40:17.530 --> 40:19.500
You guys spent a night together
and now-

40:19.530 --> 40:21.500
We're not having true love
forever more, OK?

40:21.540 --> 40:24.770
We're just two exes that are
having a nice time together.

40:24.810 --> 40:26.110
OK.

40:26.140 --> 40:29.010
It's just, seeing you guys
so happy again,

40:29.040 --> 40:32.140
especially when I thought you
weren't gonna get along at all,

40:32.180 --> 40:34.980
was really nice.

Christmas present.

Look, I- I know you're
busy working

40:47.930 --> 40:50.160
but everyone needs sustenance.

40:50.200 --> 40:53.230
Can I cook you lunch?

40:53.270 --> 40:54.800
Sure.

41:05.810 --> 41:07.480

41:11.450 --> 41:12.750
Mmm. It smells incredible.

41:12.790 --> 41:13.950
Well, I went all out.

41:13.990 --> 41:16.090
I almost felt like I owed you
for being my test subject

41:16.120 --> 41:18.190
through school.

41:18.230 --> 41:19.760
We were broke students.

41:19.790 --> 41:22.360
You were working
with oodles of noodles.

41:22.400 --> 41:24.160
As I recall, you worked wonders.

41:24.200 --> 41:25.830
You remember our first
Christmas together?

41:25.870 --> 41:29.270
Yes, you made a Yorkshire
pudding in a toaster oven.

41:29.300 --> 41:30.170
And I'm pretty sure we ate about

41:30.200 --> 41:32.510
two pounds of ribbon candy
that night.

41:32.540 --> 41:33.640
[laughs]

41:33.670 --> 41:40.550
Tonight, however, I have
for you, a miso-glazed turkey

41:40.580 --> 41:44.150
with roasted yams,
gochujang green beans,

41:44.190 --> 41:45.990
and a five-spice gravy.

41:51.490 --> 41:53.430
Now, I need your honest opinion.

42:07.940 --> 42:09.540
Mmm.

42:10.750 --> 42:14.080
Honestly, I would elope
with this plate if I could.

42:14.120 --> 42:16.520
[laughs]

42:24.230 --> 42:27.190
Can I let you in on
a little secret?

42:27.230 --> 42:31.030
I haven't spent a Christmas
with my family in years.

42:31.070 --> 42:34.070
Being back here where we spent
so many Christmases as kids...

42:34.100 --> 42:36.040
Are you getting nostalgic?

42:36.070 --> 42:39.410
Worse.

42:39.440 --> 42:40.870
I've been thinking
about doing something

42:40.910 --> 42:44.210
that I swore to myself
I never would.

42:44.250 --> 42:46.750
Put down some roots
back home.

42:46.780 --> 42:48.210
Ean Callaghan.

42:48.250 --> 42:50.680
"Put down roots" are three words
that I never thought

42:50.720 --> 42:52.120
I would hear you say.

42:52.150 --> 42:53.450
Seriously though?

42:53.490 --> 42:55.050
Are you sure that's
what you wanna do?

42:55.090 --> 42:57.690
No, I'm not sure at all.

42:57.730 --> 43:00.060
But it's something
that I'm open to.

43:00.090 --> 43:01.530
I've just been thinking about
what it would be like

43:01.560 --> 43:03.130
to be closer to home.

43:03.160 --> 43:04.730
To my family.

43:04.770 --> 43:06.630
People I love.

43:06.670 --> 43:07.770
And then I figured out
what it would be like to cook

43:07.800 --> 43:10.200
the same ten dishes every day
for the rest of my life

43:10.240 --> 43:12.940
and I do things like apply
for jobs in Finland

43:12.970 --> 43:16.280
and start immediately
after Christmas.

43:16.310 --> 43:20.110
Still, the thought of having my
own place is pretty appealing.

43:22.080 --> 43:24.380
OK, what if...

43:26.520 --> 43:28.590
you could have a different menu
every week?

43:28.620 --> 43:30.920
Limited, but different.

43:35.800 --> 43:39.100
A pop-up restaurant that's
always in the same place.

43:40.700 --> 43:44.640
I can do pop-up Indian
or pop-up Brazilian.

43:44.670 --> 43:45.640
Exactly.

43:45.670 --> 43:48.740
It could be a small place,
manageable crowds,

43:48.780 --> 43:51.340
warm, welcoming,
adventurous.

43:51.380 --> 43:52.980
Just like you.

43:53.010 --> 43:54.780
People would love it.

43:57.520 --> 43:58.820
Wow, that looks really cool.

43:58.850 --> 44:00.690
Ean's Café.

44:00.720 --> 44:01.750
We can work on the name.

44:01.790 --> 44:02.690
We can?

44:02.720 --> 44:03.990
Well, you can.

44:04.030 --> 44:05.960
[laughs]

44:05.990 --> 44:07.430
See? This is the Lacey
I remember.

44:07.460 --> 44:09.090
Just drawing from her heart.

44:09.130 --> 44:10.330
It's terrific to see.

44:10.360 --> 44:11.860
Wait until it's finished.

44:11.900 --> 44:13.070
OK.

44:13.670 --> 44:14.570
What's that?

44:14.600 --> 44:19.140
This is my very famous
Christmas dessert.

44:21.910 --> 44:26.150
A Cranberry gingerbread soufflé
with bourbon molasses sauce.

44:26.180 --> 44:27.980
Wow.

44:28.020 --> 44:32.050
And to think I was expecting
a simple cobbler.

44:32.090 --> 44:33.150
It smells heavenly.

44:33.190 --> 44:36.490
Well, if I did it right
it should taste even better.

44:39.330 --> 44:40.790
[giggles]

44:43.400 --> 44:45.460
Mmm.

44:45.500 --> 44:47.470
You did it right.

44:47.500 --> 44:49.470
You should get a spoon so
I don't eat it all myself.

44:49.500 --> 44:51.140
OK.

44:53.340 --> 44:54.410
Mmm.

44:54.440 --> 44:55.110
Do you think you could make
another one of these?

44:55.140 --> 44:57.010
If you'll eat it, I'll make it.

44:57.040 --> 44:58.980
I wish we could but we should
probably get back

44:59.010 --> 45:00.580
to the cottage and finish up
for Ava.

45:00.610 --> 45:01.150
Mmm.

45:01.180 --> 45:02.310
And we need to restock.

45:02.350 --> 45:03.420
Right. Right.

45:03.450 --> 45:06.520
Maybe we could stop by and grab
a cider on the way.

45:06.550 --> 45:09.390
I know this place that makes
a mean gingerbread cider.

45:09.420 --> 45:11.120
Sounds amazing.

45:12.230 --> 45:16.830
So, what's it like living in
so many places?

45:16.860 --> 45:19.400
It was exhilarating.

45:19.430 --> 45:20.830
A lot of time I'd show up
to a new place

45:20.870 --> 45:23.340
and I wouldn't have
any kind of plan at all.

45:23.370 --> 45:24.700
That would drive me crazy.

45:24.740 --> 45:26.340
It's actually kinda great.

45:26.370 --> 45:28.440
It would allow me to discover
all kinds of new things.

45:28.480 --> 45:33.410
I would wander down random paths
or visit these remote towns

45:33.450 --> 45:35.750
and that's always when
I would find something special.

45:35.780 --> 45:36.850
Actually sounds kinda nice.

45:36.880 --> 45:37.850
Mmm-mm.

45:37.890 --> 45:40.020
Nowhere you have to be,
nothing you have to do.

45:40.050 --> 45:42.520
I can see the appeal of that.

45:43.320 --> 45:45.560
Well, you should try
it sometime.

45:45.590 --> 45:46.230
What do you mean?

45:46.260 --> 45:47.060
Something you've never done.

45:47.090 --> 45:48.530
There's always something
to discover,

45:48.560 --> 45:50.430
you just gotta be willing
to look.

45:52.170 --> 45:53.970
Something you've never done?

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Something I've never done.

45:57.510 --> 45:59.270
These wreathes are amazing.

45:59.310 --> 46:00.310
Oh, thank you.

46:00.340 --> 46:02.880
Well, I learned how to do
this from my mother.

46:02.910 --> 46:04.240
Would you like to try?

46:04.280 --> 46:05.210
I know you've got work to do.

46:05.250 --> 46:08.910
No, no, let's build
some Christmas wreathes.

46:08.950 --> 46:09.780
Hey.

46:09.820 --> 46:11.220
Let's make some wreathes.

46:11.250 --> 46:13.050
Come on.

46:15.120 --> 46:16.920
I've never done this before.

46:16.960 --> 46:19.120
That's why they call it
an adventure.

46:21.700 --> 46:23.530
Start here, take a few boughs.

46:31.610 --> 46:33.410
You know, you could put
that in your portfolio.

46:33.440 --> 46:35.070
Very funny.

46:37.210 --> 46:38.740
It's harder than it looks.

46:38.780 --> 46:40.680
You did a lovely job.

46:40.710 --> 46:41.210
See?

46:41.250 --> 46:42.510
I did a lovely job.

46:42.550 --> 46:44.650
It's perfect.

46:44.690 --> 46:46.190
Really special.

46:46.220 --> 46:47.790
Thank you.

46:57.830 --> 46:58.760
That was amazing.

46:58.800 --> 47:01.970
That's the most fun I've had
in a long time.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.200
Well, you should let loose
more often.

47:04.240 --> 47:05.170
Oh, you know what?

47:05.210 --> 47:06.470
There's a tree-lighting tonight.

47:06.510 --> 47:07.410
That's right.

47:07.440 --> 47:08.370
I haven't been to one
of those in years.

47:08.410 --> 47:09.780
Neither have I.

47:09.810 --> 47:11.310
But, if my memory
serves me correctly,

47:11.350 --> 47:13.150
they put on quite a show.

47:13.180 --> 47:14.010
Let's go.

47:14.050 --> 47:15.680
OK, deal.

47:15.720 --> 47:17.980
I should be able to have
my drawings finished by then.

47:18.020 --> 47:20.690
We can drink hot chocolate
and sing carols.

47:20.720 --> 47:22.290
[laughs]

47:22.320 --> 47:25.060
I don't think I've seen you
this happy since I got here.

47:25.090 --> 47:27.090
It feels like I'm looking
at the old Lacey again.

47:28.830 --> 47:30.660
Say "cheese".

47:31.070 --> 47:32.100
You know what?

47:32.130 --> 47:35.400
You are just so full of
Christmas cheer right now

47:35.440 --> 47:38.040
that I think it's time
you meet Santa.

47:38.070 --> 47:39.910
I- I don't know if I'm ready
for Santa.

47:39.940 --> 47:41.470
I think you are.

47:41.510 --> 47:42.810
Come on.

47:45.880 --> 47:47.050
Say "cheese".

47:52.020 --> 47:53.190
Santa.

47:53.220 --> 47:54.690
Hi, Santa.

47:57.260 --> 47:58.720
Cheese.

47:58.760 --> 48:00.690
Lacey.

48:00.730 --> 48:02.130
Roger.

48:10.140 --> 48:11.500
You're here early.

48:11.540 --> 48:12.500
I know.

48:12.540 --> 48:15.010
I had an idea about our
Pine Bay presentation.

48:15.040 --> 48:16.240
Great.

48:16.280 --> 48:17.080
You could have called.

48:17.110 --> 48:18.280
You didn't have to come
a day early.

48:18.310 --> 48:21.380
No, this is- this is big.

48:21.420 --> 48:22.210
Roger Whistler.

48:22.250 --> 48:23.080
Lacey's boyfriend.

48:23.120 --> 48:23.950
Ean Callaghan.

48:23.980 --> 48:26.890
I'm the bride's brother
and best man.

48:26.920 --> 48:29.020
Oh, right.

48:29.060 --> 48:30.190
I've heard about you.

48:30.220 --> 48:32.520
In the flesh.

48:32.560 --> 48:34.130
So I'm gonna get checked in.

48:34.160 --> 48:37.360
I pre-booked the study so
you can meet me in there.

48:37.400 --> 48:38.230
Great.

48:38.270 --> 48:40.600
You are gonna love
what I'm thinking.

48:45.170 --> 48:48.110
Looks like I really do need
to work now.

48:48.140 --> 48:49.040
Yeah.

48:49.080 --> 48:50.080
Yeah, I get it.

48:50.110 --> 48:51.280
Um, good luck.

48:51.310 --> 48:52.910
Thanks.

48:52.950 --> 48:54.780
Wait for me to finish
the cottage.

48:54.820 --> 48:56.450
Sure.

49:04.430 --> 49:05.490
So just go with me on this.

49:05.530 --> 49:07.490
I was thinking about Pine Bay
and how we can make

49:07.530 --> 49:10.160
Quinn & Whistler's presentation
really stand out.

49:10.200 --> 49:11.160
OK.

49:11.200 --> 49:12.970
We're gonna build a model
of your drawings.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.570
Exactly like the ones that
we used to do in design school.

49:15.600 --> 49:17.070
I love building models but-

49:17.100 --> 49:19.400
And then we'll have it
at the presentation.

49:19.440 --> 49:20.570
Lacey, come on.

49:20.610 --> 49:23.240
You know how clients react
to actual tangible objects.

49:23.280 --> 49:25.310
This is what could cinch it
for us.

49:25.350 --> 49:27.950
We just- we have to dive in.

49:27.980 --> 49:29.180
OK.

49:29.220 --> 49:30.920
Let's get started.

49:30.950 --> 49:32.150
There she is.

50:09.420 --> 50:11.390
What's this?

50:11.430 --> 50:13.160
It's a Christmas tree.

50:13.190 --> 50:14.530
It makes it more homey.

50:14.560 --> 50:15.490
Homey.

50:15.530 --> 50:18.400
And a fireplace makes it
look more lived-in,

50:18.430 --> 50:20.670
like there's actually life
inside these walls.

50:20.700 --> 50:23.240
You do remember we're not
selling a home, right?

50:23.270 --> 50:25.070
We're selling a live-work space.

50:25.110 --> 50:26.300
Exactly.

50:26.340 --> 50:30.410
And I think that that can be
enhanced by adding small details

50:30.440 --> 50:33.680
to show more of
the lived space.

50:35.180 --> 50:37.150
How about a compromise?

50:37.180 --> 50:43.160
A hint of Christmas,
a hint of home.

50:43.190 --> 50:44.720
Hmm?

50:44.760 --> 50:46.060
What's wrong?

50:46.090 --> 50:48.930
I just don't know if this design
works anymore.

50:48.960 --> 50:51.160
It feels so empty.

50:51.200 --> 50:52.430
You're just getting cold feet.

50:52.470 --> 50:53.900
On the home stretch.

50:53.930 --> 50:57.000
Shake it off.

50:57.040 --> 50:58.470
You're right.

51:00.070 --> 51:01.340
I'm gonna do a coffee run.

51:01.380 --> 51:02.540
Oh, perfect.

51:02.580 --> 51:04.980
I'll take a double espresso.

51:16.460 --> 51:18.220
You left work behind.

51:18.260 --> 51:20.760
Everyone needs
caffeine sometimes.

51:20.790 --> 51:23.400
What're you doing
with those stockings?

51:23.430 --> 51:25.130
I saw these at a kiosk over
there and I had to get them

51:25.170 --> 51:26.430
for Ava and Mason.

51:26.470 --> 51:27.530
I was gonna bring them up
to the cottage

51:27.570 --> 51:29.070
when we go back
in the morning.

51:29.100 --> 51:31.040
There's nothing like a stocking
full of candy

51:31.070 --> 51:32.040
on Christmas morning.

51:32.070 --> 51:33.140
[laughs]

51:33.170 --> 51:35.240
Unless, of course, the designer
has any objections.

51:35.280 --> 51:36.240
No.

51:36.280 --> 51:36.780
No, not at all.

51:36.810 --> 51:37.940
That's a great idea.

51:37.980 --> 51:38.740
Maybe you could come
help me.

51:38.780 --> 51:40.480
I mean, if you're
not too busy.

51:40.510 --> 51:42.210
The place looks beautiful
right now.

51:42.250 --> 51:43.450
I would love to.

51:45.150 --> 51:47.590
Uh, well, I should get back.

51:47.620 --> 51:48.590
Oh, hey.

51:48.620 --> 51:50.390
Don't forget about the
tree-lighting tonight.

51:50.420 --> 51:52.720
It's the last big event
before Christmas.

51:52.760 --> 51:54.990
Ean, I'm not sure
I'm gonna make it.

51:55.030 --> 51:56.560
Oh, you can't miss it.

51:56.600 --> 51:58.500
Come on, it signals that
Christmas is almost here.

51:58.530 --> 52:02.100
Which, in this town,
is full-on Whoville.

52:02.140 --> 52:05.340
I would love to, but...
duty calls.

52:05.370 --> 52:06.440
Really, we have
so much work to do

52:06.470 --> 52:07.610
if we're gonna get
this contract.

52:07.640 --> 52:08.840
I understand.

52:08.880 --> 52:10.480
Well, I don't.

52:10.510 --> 52:11.380
Come on, Lacey.

52:11.410 --> 52:12.310
Don't you remember
how much fun we had

52:12.350 --> 52:13.980
at the tree-lighting
when we were little?

52:14.010 --> 52:14.650
Yeah, come on.

52:14.680 --> 52:15.580
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

52:15.620 --> 52:16.350
Come on, Ava.

52:16.380 --> 52:17.220
She has to work.

52:17.250 --> 52:19.580
She also has to be
my maid of honour.

52:19.620 --> 52:21.290
The whole wedding party
is going.

52:21.320 --> 52:22.250
Come on, you
can't miss it.

52:22.290 --> 52:23.420
Please?

52:23.460 --> 52:24.360
Ava, I'm sorry.

52:24.390 --> 52:25.490
I wish I could.

52:25.530 --> 52:28.330
Can't Roger work while you go
to the tree-lighting?

52:28.360 --> 52:30.500
It's just that I never get
to see you anymore.

52:30.530 --> 52:31.760
And if you can't,
I understand.

52:31.800 --> 52:34.770
But I would really like it if
my best friend was there, too.

52:34.800 --> 52:35.700
I will try my best.

52:35.740 --> 52:38.800
I'll keep my fingers crossed
that you do.

52:38.840 --> 52:40.570
Bye.

52:41.540 --> 52:42.970
[sighs]

52:53.150 --> 52:55.690
It's supposed to be all white
on the inside walls.

52:55.720 --> 52:57.520
No colour.

52:58.490 --> 52:59.460
You're right.

52:59.490 --> 53:01.660
I'm just... trying to find a way
to warm it up.

53:01.700 --> 53:02.990
To make it more of a home.

53:03.030 --> 53:03.960
Are you kidding?

53:04.000 --> 53:06.630
This is the perfect home
for people like us.

53:06.670 --> 53:09.630
That's who the customer is.

53:18.910 --> 53:20.510
You know, the tree-lighting
is tonight.

53:20.550 --> 53:22.810
Yeah, I never understood that.

53:22.850 --> 53:26.750
Somebody plugs in a tree
and then everyone claps.

53:26.790 --> 53:29.920
It's about community,
being together.

53:29.960 --> 53:31.660
It's full-on Whoville.

53:31.690 --> 53:33.090
It might be kinda fun.

53:33.130 --> 53:35.460
Maybe for some people.

53:36.700 --> 53:38.930
When I was a kid I used
to love it.

53:38.970 --> 53:40.870
I felt like Christmas was
officially here as soon as

53:40.900 --> 53:43.340
the tree downtown was lit.

53:43.370 --> 53:46.370
Sounds like you really wanna
go to this tree-lighting thing.

53:46.410 --> 53:49.270
No, it's just nostalgia.

53:49.310 --> 53:51.180
I haven't been in years.

53:54.210 --> 53:55.380
You know what?

53:55.420 --> 53:57.380
I think I actually might go.

53:57.420 --> 53:58.520
Lacey...

53:58.550 --> 54:01.050
It won't take long, I can finish
this when I get back.

54:01.090 --> 54:03.190
You know, I kinda forgot
how much I enjoy the holidays.

54:03.220 --> 54:04.020
Do you wanna come?

54:04.060 --> 54:05.420
It might be fun.

54:05.460 --> 54:06.730
<i> No thanks, I'm good.</i>

54:06.760 --> 54:08.930
I'll see you later.

54:08.960 --> 54:11.530
You're being very weird.

54:15.270 --> 54:17.500
Very, very weird.

54:25.250 --> 54:26.280
[squeals]

54:26.310 --> 54:26.950
You're here!

54:26.980 --> 54:28.380
Yeah, I made it.

54:28.420 --> 54:29.510
And it's Christmas.

54:29.550 --> 54:32.920
Wow, someone's getting
into the spirit of the season.

54:32.950 --> 54:33.950
Where's Roger?

Roger, I just wanna talk
with you about something

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:31.720
other than clients and design
for the next year.

01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:32.720
That's all we talk about.

01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:35.550
That's the only thing
we connect over anymore.

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:45.500
Try not to get whiplash
before my wedding.

01:04:45.530 --> 01:04:46.330
What do you mean?

01:04:46.370 --> 01:04:47.470
Ean, I'm your sister.

01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:50.940
And a woman raised on a steady
diet of romance novels.

01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:52.800
I think I know what's going on.

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:55.240
I have no idea what's going on
in your mind.

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:56.210
The only thing
I'm thinking about

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:59.080
is if I'm gonna take
my next overseas job.

01:04:59.110 --> 01:05:01.350
I might have to leave
pretty soon.

01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:03.280
I was hoping to spend more time
back home.

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:04.750
I don't get here very often.

01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:05.480
So stay.

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:06.450
Tell them no.

01:05:06.490 --> 01:05:07.850
It's not that simple.

01:05:07.890 --> 01:05:08.490
It is that simple.

01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:09.650
You just have to be ready.

01:05:09.690 --> 01:05:10.690
Ready for what?

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:13.420
Ready to stop running away
from your problems.

01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:16.030
Ready to stay and fight for
what you want.

01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:17.500
I don't know what you're
talking about.

01:05:17.530 --> 01:05:19.430
Besides, if it's romance
you want

01:05:19.470 --> 01:05:23.000
I don't think it gets much more
romantic than those two.

01:05:25.070 --> 01:05:26.600
You know, for a smart guy,

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:29.310
you really say some seriously
dense things.

01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:30.110
[laughs]

01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:31.840
Wha-

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:33.950
I just want balance
in my life.

01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:35.350
And in our relationship.

01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:37.680
I want work to end when
we leave the office

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:40.620
and not follow us through
the holidays and to weddings

01:05:40.650 --> 01:05:41.320
and family events and-

01:05:41.350 --> 01:05:42.650
OK.

01:05:42.690 --> 01:05:44.620
I hear you.

01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:47.190
I just- I see it differently.

01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:49.790
Lacey, right now we have
this opportunity

01:05:49.830 --> 01:05:52.060
that might not happen again
for a really long time.

01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:53.800
We can't take our foot off
the gas.

01:05:53.830 --> 01:05:55.900
We can always scale back.

01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:58.000
Later.

01:05:58.040 --> 01:05:59.800
I promise.

01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:34.610
Looks like those old sketches
you used to do

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:35.670
in grad school.

01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:37.380
That's because I drew it.

01:06:37.410 --> 01:06:40.750
I drew it for Ean but I guess
he doesn't want it anymore.

01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:43.510
Let's go.

01:06:56.030 --> 01:06:58.360
I should probably head upstairs
and get packed.

01:06:58.400 --> 01:06:59.660
I had to change our flights
to tomorrow night

01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:01.100
after the wedding.

01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:02.570
A red-eye on Christmas Eve?

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:04.700
Plane will be empty.
We can do all our work on there.

01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:06.700
Lacey, after Pine Bay is done

01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:09.270
I promise you the best belated
Christmas ever.

01:07:09.310 --> 01:07:10.910
Scout's honour.

01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:14.350
I wasn't a scout.

01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:15.780
Come on, let's go get packed.

01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:16.910
[message alert]

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:18.680
Um, I'm being called outside.

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:20.020
Maid of honour duties.

01:07:20.050 --> 01:07:20.950
OK.

01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:21.690
I'll see you in a bit.

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:23.150
Yeah.

01:07:27.330 --> 01:07:28.690
Thank you.

01:07:33.070 --> 01:07:35.570
Can I ply you
with hot chocolate?

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:39.570
[laughs]

01:07:39.610 --> 01:07:41.170
Get in here.

01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:47.410
We're flying out tomorrow.

01:07:47.450 --> 01:07:48.550
Right after the wedding.

01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:51.280
We're set to present our plans
the day after Christmas.

01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:54.290
Congratulations?

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:56.790
We've worked so hard to get
this far and we should both

01:07:56.820 --> 01:08:00.390
be so excited but I'm just...

01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:03.590
I'm not.

01:08:03.630 --> 01:08:06.260
It's like something changed
in me.

01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:09.600
Do you think it has anything
to do with seeing Ean again?

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:10.940
Maybe.

01:08:10.970 --> 01:08:12.740
I think seeing him
is like looking into

01:08:12.770 --> 01:08:14.310
a window of the past.

01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:15.740
I spent so much time
thinking about

01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:17.410
what went wrong between us,

01:08:17.439 --> 01:08:22.010
I kinda forgot how right things
were at one point, too.

01:08:22.050 --> 01:08:23.779
Well, relationships change.

01:08:23.819 --> 01:08:26.180
Maybe there's some version
of your old relationship

01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:29.020
that you can have now,
like friends even.

01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:29.990
Sure.

01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:31.359
Friends.

01:08:31.390 --> 01:08:32.290
But not really.

01:08:32.330 --> 01:08:34.290
My life is so different
in San Francisco.

01:08:34.330 --> 01:08:36.760
And he's still travelling.

01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:39.859
I think our time together
is done.

01:08:39.899 --> 01:08:42.370
Well, it sounds like that's hard
for you to say.

01:08:42.399 --> 01:08:45.140
You can't get back what you had
with someone.

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:52.710
Yeah, but technically you get
back some version of it.

01:08:52.750 --> 01:08:55.710
Technically I agree.

01:08:55.750 --> 01:08:59.350
But I don't think that's gonna
happen with me and Ean.

01:08:59.390 --> 01:09:02.990
He brought up the idea
of getting back together.

01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:04.960
I said no.

01:09:04.990 --> 01:09:07.020
But I think once Roger and I
get home and we get back

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:10.460
into our routine I'll realize
that I made the right decision.

01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:12.560
Well, if that is your Christmas
wish then I hope

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:15.630
it happens for you.

01:09:15.670 --> 01:09:16.970
You're still gonna be telling
me fairy tales

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.970
when we're little old ladies.

01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:21.140
Because I believe in
the magic of the season

01:09:21.170 --> 01:09:23.870
and I don't think it's done
with this yet.

01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:25.410
I'll see you later?

01:09:25.439 --> 01:09:26.380
Good night.

01:09:26.410 --> 01:09:27.609
Good night.

01:09:30.350 --> 01:09:31.950
[sighs]

01:09:34.250 --> 01:09:36.350
It gives me great joy
this holiday season

01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:42.359
to join Ava and Mason
as husband and wife.

01:09:42.399 --> 01:09:47.029
<i> May they have many happy</i>
<i> holidays together. </i>

01:09:47.069 --> 01:09:48.370
<i> By the power vested in me,</i>

01:09:48.399 --> 01:09:51.040
<i> I have the honour this</i>
<i> Christmas season to pronounce</i>

01:09:51.069 --> 01:09:54.240
<i> Ava and Mason</i>

They both look so happy.

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:41.350
Yeah.

01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:46.220
Did you get all your work done?

01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:48.260
I did.

01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:51.460
Congratulations.

01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:54.230
Just one more meeting
when we get back.

01:10:54.270 --> 01:10:56.100
You must be very happy.

01:10:58.170 --> 01:10:59.640
Very.

01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:04.280
What about the restaurant?

01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:06.810
Have you thought more
about it?

01:11:06.850 --> 01:11:08.350
That was a pipe dream.

01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:10.610
Nothing more.

01:11:10.650 --> 01:11:13.450
Besides, I accepted
that job in Finland.

01:11:13.490 --> 01:11:15.320
You did?

01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:17.660
I leave first thing

[clinking glass]

01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:47.150
I guess it's time
to start the toasts

01:11:47.190 --> 01:11:50.850
and subject you all to
my very amateur thoughts

01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:52.520
on life and love.

01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:56.160
[clears throat]

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:57.160
I hope he talks fast.

01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:00.000
You still need to pack
for the flight tonight.

01:12:00.030 --> 01:12:02.130
I've had a lot of time these
past few days to think

01:12:02.170 --> 01:12:04.200
about what makes a
good relationship.

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:08.340
One that lasts, one that
can survive the hard times

01:12:08.370 --> 01:12:10.910
and the inevitable
disagreements,

01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:12.140
and for a moment there
I thought

01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:16.550
maybe it's just sheer
determination.

01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:19.320
What makes a love that lasts?

01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:21.350
I know you're probably thinking
if I had the answer

01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:23.850
to that question I would be
a very rich man.

01:12:23.890 --> 01:12:25.590
Well, get out your wallets
because I think I have

01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:27.520
at least part of that answer.

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:29.660
[crowd laughs]

01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:32.100
Real love is about knowing
someone so well

01:12:32.130 --> 01:12:34.260
they feel like an extension
of yourself.

01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:36.030
You share each other's
hopes and dreams,

01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:37.900
even if they aren't exactly
your own.

01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:40.700
You love and accept each other
exactly as you are

01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:42.610
without asking them
to change,

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:44.240
and you always put each
other first,

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:47.010
naturally and effortlessly.

01:12:47.050 --> 01:12:50.210
There's a part of us that
most people take for granted

01:12:50.250 --> 01:12:53.350
but then there's a part of us
that only a few people

01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:55.750
ever really get to know.

01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:59.760
I believe that true love is
about loving that part, too.

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:07.770
So, to Ava and Mason, for loving
all sides of each other,

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:10.330
naturally and effortlessly.

01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:20.540
[applause]

01:13:21.810 --> 01:13:24.720
First, Ava and Mason,
thank you for an amazing

01:13:24.750 --> 01:13:28.890
few days and the best Christmas
that I've had in a while.

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:33.990
Your love and your relationship
are truly an inspiration.

01:13:34.030 --> 01:13:36.460
I think at Christmas people
take a step back

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:39.500
and think about
what's really important,

01:13:39.530 --> 01:13:41.800
and it always becomes clear.

01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:45.570
Friends, family, and love.

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:48.340
But Ava and Mason have got
me doing a lot of thinking

01:13:48.370 --> 01:13:51.240
about love and relationship
over the last few days.

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:52.680
I thought I knew.

01:13:52.710 --> 01:13:54.950
I thought I had it all
figured out.

01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:57.650
When I got here I would have
said that a good relationship

01:13:57.680 --> 01:13:59.450
is about having
the same goals.

01:13:59.490 --> 01:14:02.690
Striving for the same things,
syncing up your priorities.

01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:04.520
It sounded so simple.

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:06.920
But I had forgotten
that real love

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:08.790
is so much bigger than that.

01:14:08.830 --> 01:14:10.430
Love isn't simple.

01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:13.330
It's about disagreeing
and agreeing.

01:14:13.370 --> 01:14:14.870
It's about loving someone enough
to care about

01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:19.870
what they care about, to hope
for what they hope for.

01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:21.710
It's about helping another
person live a life

01:14:21.740 --> 01:14:23.770
that they've always dreamed of.

01:14:23.810 --> 01:14:28.080
Real love, like Christmas,
is about giving.

01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:31.650
To Ava and Mason.

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:35.090
May you always share in each
other's hopes and dreams.

01:14:39.230 --> 01:14:43.760
[applause]

01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:53.370
Can I talk to you
for a second?

01:14:53.410 --> 01:14:55.370
Yeah.

01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:06.220
I don't wanna sound paranoid but
am I just being an idiot here?

01:15:06.250 --> 01:15:09.320
Roger, I'm sorry.

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:12.220
Wow.

01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:14.460
That's not the answer
I was expecting.

01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:20.200
[sighs]

01:15:20.230 --> 01:15:22.900
So you still have feelings
for Ean.

01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:25.070
No.

01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:27.040
At the same time, yes.

01:15:27.070 --> 01:15:28.170
I didn't think that I did.

01:15:28.210 --> 01:15:30.340
Lacey, ever since we got here
I have understood about

01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:32.080
half the things you're saying.

01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:34.750
What am I missing?

01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:37.280
Me.

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:38.580
You've lost sight of me.

01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:41.290
Or maybe we've lost sight
of each other.

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:44.220
At some point we both put
ambition in first place.

01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:45.620
And that's worked.

01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:47.190
Yeah, it has.

01:15:47.230 --> 01:15:48.860
We're a great partnership.

01:15:48.890 --> 01:15:50.860
A great design team.

01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:52.530
But?

01:15:52.570 --> 01:15:55.770
But that can't be all anymore.

01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:58.770
That can't be all we are for
another year or another month.

01:15:58.800 --> 01:15:59.570
I won't wait.

01:15:59.610 --> 01:16:02.570
I can't wait for happiness
or love.

01:16:02.610 --> 01:16:05.940
We both deserve that.

01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:10.150
Well, I'd ask you
what you were gonna do

01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:14.280
but I think I know
what you're gonna say.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:16.720
Roger, I'm sorry.

01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:18.090
Me too.

01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:19.720
Let's do what we do best.

01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:21.120
Let's be a design team.

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:22.430
That's where we're still strong.

01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:24.260
That's what we have
in common.

01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:26.400
The other parts of
a relationship,

01:16:26.430 --> 01:16:27.930
they just got away
from us.

01:16:27.970 --> 01:16:28.800
And Pine Bay?

01:16:28.830 --> 01:16:30.400
We're still going forward
with that?

01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:32.140
You think I put in 18 hours
a day to walk away

01:16:32.170 --> 01:16:34.170
from my first multi-million
dollar contract?

01:16:34.210 --> 01:16:35.310
Thank goodness.

01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:37.170
But Roger,
after this project,

01:16:37.210 --> 01:16:39.740
I wanna bring balance
into the firm.

01:16:41.210 --> 01:16:42.250
Meaning?

01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:45.620
Meaning I don't only want
to design sleek spaces

01:16:45.650 --> 01:16:46.780
for corporations.

01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:48.690
I wanna work on
personal projects.

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:50.090
I wanna work
with clients again,

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:51.360
get to know them
as people.

01:16:51.390 --> 01:16:53.360
Help them realize
their visions.

01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:54.630
There was a time
in grad school

01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:55.860
when we both wanted that.

01:16:55.890 --> 01:16:56.930
There was also a time
in grad school

01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:59.530
when we drank instant coffee
and ate cold pizza.

01:16:59.570 --> 01:17:01.260
[laughs]

01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:02.600
Sounds good to me.

01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:03.670
Wow.

01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:06.740
You have really found a new part
of yourself here.

01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:13.810
Push the meeting
until the new year.

01:17:13.850 --> 01:17:14.510
I don't know.

01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:17.510
Our design is worth waiting for.

01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:20.380
OK.

01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:23.290
I'll see you back
at the office.

01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:27.720
After I've celebrated Christmas.

01:17:34.970 --> 01:17:37.370
[sighs]

01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:47.040
Oh, Lacey dear, what a wonderful
toast you gave.

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:47.810
Thank you.

01:17:47.850 --> 01:17:49.010
You and Ean both.

01:17:49.050 --> 01:17:50.350
Have you seen him?

01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:52.450
I think he left for
the airport already.

01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:54.520
You know he took another
job abroad?

01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:56.450
Uh, he told me,
but he left so soon?

01:17:56.490 --> 01:17:59.520
I think he's spending the night
at the airport hotel.

01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:01.660
He leaves tomorrow first thing
in the morning.

01:18:01.690 --> 01:18:03.990
You know, it's funny, just
yesterday he was talking about

01:18:04.030 --> 01:18:07.160
coming home again and
putting down some real roots.

01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:10.470
I guess he'll always be
a traveller at heart.

01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:23.180
Would you like to join me?

01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:25.080
Yes.

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:28.690
I wanted to take a break
from the noise of the party.

01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:35.930
Why the long face, Lacey?

01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:40.900
Uh, well, let's see.

01:18:40.930 --> 01:18:45.770
I'm about to land the biggest
client of my career

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:46.870
right at the point

01:18:46.910 --> 01:18:49.870
where I wanna spend more time
outside the office.

01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:52.610
More time for myself and
the people I care about.

01:18:52.640 --> 01:19:02.290
And for the first time in years
I feel like I'm in love.

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:06.620
But it's too late.

01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:10.360
It's not feeling like a very
merry Christmas.

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:14.200
And I can't help thinking that
maybe there is something

01:19:14.230 --> 01:19:18.470
about the cottage that brought
Ean and me back together,

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:20.040
but I messed it up.

01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:21.970
Well, I don't know about that.

01:19:22.010 --> 01:19:24.710
But I do know that the only
magic at the cottage

01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:27.040
is the magic of Christmas.

01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:29.410
The magic of togetherness.

01:19:29.450 --> 01:19:31.110
It's a special place.

01:19:31.150 --> 01:19:32.420
Mmmhmm.

01:19:32.450 --> 01:19:33.980
And you were right.

01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:34.850
It's the traditions,

01:19:34.890 --> 01:19:36.720
the memories that make it
that way.

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:37.750
It is.

01:19:40.130 --> 01:19:42.460
I'm going to turn in.

01:19:42.490 --> 01:19:44.760
I'll see you at the breakfast.

01:19:46.470 --> 01:19:48.060
Oh, Lacey dear?

01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:49.130
One more favour.

01:19:49.170 --> 01:19:51.970
You need to take these presents
up to the cottage.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.770
Presents for the bride
and groom

01:19:53.810 --> 01:19:56.910
must be under the Christmas tree
on Christmas morning.

01:19:56.940 --> 01:19:58.410
Of course.

01:20:47.190 --> 01:20:48.660
<i> Hi.</i>

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:53.000
What're you doing here?

01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:55.670
Um, Aunt Sarah asked me
for a favour.

01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:57.730
She wanted the fire going
and the champagne chilling

01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:59.140
for Ava and Mason.

01:20:59.170 --> 01:21:01.000
They should be here
in about an hour.

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:02.670
But I guess I kinda wanted
to come back here one more time

01:21:02.710 --> 01:21:07.140
to just be here and remember
all the good times we had.

01:21:07.180 --> 01:21:09.150
Me too.

01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:14.150
Um, Ava tells me
you're flying out tonight?

01:21:14.190 --> 01:21:16.190
I'm not.

01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:17.120
Not anymore.

01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:18.020
Don't you have some big
important meeting-

01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:19.320
It can wait.

01:21:20.930 --> 01:21:26.060
I uh... I broke up with Roger.

01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:27.260
What?

01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:31.170
I was listening to your toast
and I realized that Roger

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:33.200
doesn't know all the different
sides of me.

01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:34.910
He only knows one.

01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:38.440
But I realized that I need more
than work to be happy.

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:42.550
I want love and relationship
and family.

01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:43.780
That sounds pretty doable
to me.

01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:45.920
And I know you say you don't
wanna open your own restaurant

01:21:45.950 --> 01:21:47.350
and I know that you're travelling

01:21:47.390 --> 01:21:49.020
and that you're
gonna leave and-

01:21:49.050 --> 01:21:49.750
Lacey, I-

01:21:49.790 --> 01:21:51.090
I know that you're upset
with me.

01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:52.560
Why would you think that?

01:21:52.590 --> 01:21:54.190
I saw the drawing
that you tossed.

01:21:54.230 --> 01:21:55.430
And it's fine.

01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:57.230
I just- I want you to know that
the person you've been with

01:21:57.260 --> 01:21:59.860
for the last few days?

01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:01.300
She's back for good.

01:22:01.330 --> 01:22:03.270
And she'll be here when
you get back from Finland

01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:06.240
or wherever it is you need
to travel to.

01:22:06.270 --> 01:22:08.910
I want you back in my life.

01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:17.910
I didn't toss it,
I dropped it.

01:22:17.950 --> 01:22:19.420
But then I went back for it.

01:22:19.450 --> 01:22:25.290
This design, this vision,
is beautiful.

01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:27.420
So is the woman who drew it.

01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:29.930
And I'm never gonna leave
her behind again.

01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:31.800
I've always loved you, Lacey.

01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:33.930
I love you, too.

01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:36.730
[message alert]

01:22:36.770 --> 01:22:37.430
You can answer that if you-

01:22:37.470 --> 01:22:38.570
No.

01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:41.300
I don't want anything to come
between us right now.

01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:46.610
You know, maybe this place
really is magic.

01:22:46.650 --> 01:22:47.680
What about Finland?

01:22:47.710 --> 01:22:50.310
I'm not going on
that trip anymore.

01:22:50.350 --> 01:22:52.750
I've got another
adventure planned.

01:22:52.780 --> 01:22:56.290
Maybe that old family myth
is true after all.
