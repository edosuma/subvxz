00:48.381 --> 00:49.746
Chapter one.

00:49.816 --> 00:53.377
Sometimes, despite your
best efforts otherwise,

00:53.453 --> 00:55.546
life will give you lemons.

01:01.761 --> 01:05.025
When that happens,
you've got two choices,
friend.

01:05.632 --> 01:10.399
You can wear a sour face
or make lemonade.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.450
I never should have
booked this city.

03:05.518 --> 03:08.043
Come on,
come on, come on.

03:08.721 --> 03:10.018
Finally!

03:10.390 --> 03:11.448
Huh?

03:11.524 --> 03:13.583
What, did you swim here?
Might as well have.

03:13.660 --> 03:14.684
This is exactly
why I tell you

03:14.761 --> 03:15.887
you gotta fly in
the night before.

03:15.962 --> 03:17.190
The less time I spend
in this city, the better.

03:17.263 --> 03:19.231
I know, I know, I know.
But you'll be enthused
to know

03:19.299 --> 03:20.596
that I reamed
customer service.

03:20.667 --> 03:22.430
Your bag is gonna be
on the very next flight.

03:22.502 --> 03:23.696
But have no fear.

03:23.770 --> 03:27.206
There is a brand-new suit
waiting for you right here.

03:27.273 --> 03:28.433
Where'd you conjure
this up from?

03:28.508 --> 03:30.169
Well, rainmakers
make rain...

03:30.243 --> 03:31.608
Room key.
Voilà.

03:31.678 --> 03:33.908
There's a gorgeous
latte-colored
silk tie in there.

03:33.980 --> 03:36.039
I think you're gonna
love it. It's subtle...
Latte?

03:36.115 --> 03:37.980
Okay, there's a red
one in there, too. Okay?

03:38.051 --> 03:40.417
Can you please
just look your best?
Please, okay?

03:40.486 --> 03:44.820
Listen, all three
Unicom suits will fly
in from New York

03:44.891 --> 03:47.485
day after tomorrow
to see if we can
make a deal.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.152
All three of them?

03:49.229 --> 03:52.027
I'm Lane goddamned Marshall.

03:55.868 --> 03:58.530
Burke, for once
in your life, can you
please take the elevator?

03:58.605 --> 03:59.902
See you.

04:02.609 --> 04:04.770
Coming to the seminar?
Okay.

04:05.612 --> 04:07.580
Okay. Big day. Big day.

04:50.423 --> 04:51.981
And don't forget
the DVDs and audio books

04:52.058 --> 04:54.822
available for purchase
all through the week

04:54.894 --> 04:57.260
at our booth down the hall.

04:57.330 --> 05:00.527
And now,
without further ado,

05:00.600 --> 05:05.401
the author of the bestseller
A Path Through Grief,
my friend...

05:05.471 --> 05:08.770
No, my inspiration,
Burke Ryan.

05:31.597 --> 05:33.030
All right!

05:35.635 --> 05:37.660
Thanks, Lane. Wow!

05:38.604 --> 05:39.593
Whoo!

05:40.807 --> 05:43.139
You guys make
a guy feel good.

05:43.776 --> 05:45.937
I'm feeling okay.
How are you?

05:46.012 --> 05:47.673
A-Okay!

05:47.747 --> 05:51.080
Good.
Let me ask you a question.

05:51.150 --> 05:52.742
Any football fans
in the house?

05:54.454 --> 05:58.584
Certain college team
not too long ago
lost their season opener.

05:59.425 --> 06:01.825
They're going nowhere fast.

06:01.894 --> 06:05.523
Then something happened.
Thank you.

06:05.598 --> 06:09.591
An event that
changed everything
for their coach.

06:09.669 --> 06:11.796
The guy started
sleeping at the office,

06:11.938 --> 06:14.099
reinvented the playbook,
studied film.

06:14.173 --> 06:17.040
He was on the case 24-7.

06:17.176 --> 06:20.270
They went on to win
the national championship.

06:22.048 --> 06:26.280
Well, after all
the fanfare and the champagne,
he traipsed on home,

06:27.253 --> 06:31.747
went upstairs,
went to his closet

06:32.425 --> 06:36.088
and removed his Browning
double-barreled shotgun,

06:37.797 --> 06:41.392
put it to his chin
and pulled the trigger.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.701
See, the event
that changed it all

06:46.773 --> 06:48.934
back at the beginning
of the season?

06:49.142 --> 06:53.476
His brother,
his best friend in the world,
died of a heart attack.

06:55.648 --> 06:59.345
You might be able
to get back on the horse,
do great things.

06:59.419 --> 07:02.786
Hell, you might even win
a national championship.

07:02.855 --> 07:06.655
But if you don't
pay the piper,
he will come calling.

07:08.995 --> 07:13.125
I want to thank each
and every one of you

07:13.199 --> 07:17.693
for having the courage
to really feel
the loss of loved ones.

07:19.005 --> 07:20.905
I know it's not easy.

07:22.241 --> 07:23.970
I've been there.

07:25.211 --> 07:27.406
How are you?
You okay?

07:27.480 --> 07:28.742
A-Okay!

07:28.815 --> 07:31.147
Good. All right.
Say it one more time.
How are you?

07:31.217 --> 07:33.014
A-Okay!

07:33.085 --> 07:35.679
All right.
I'll see you in workshop.

07:45.231 --> 07:46.960
Perfect. Perfect.

07:48.034 --> 07:50.832
Good. Good. Great.

07:51.671 --> 07:53.662
Come on,
loosen up a little bit.
You need a drink?

07:53.739 --> 07:54.933
Maybe you need a drink.
Waiter!

07:55.007 --> 07:57.942
Please, no drink.
Chapter 12.

07:58.010 --> 08:01.207
"Alcohol's no more
a cure-all than a Band-Aid
on a bullet wound."

08:01.280 --> 08:04.306
All right. Now flash me
that sign of yours.

08:07.753 --> 08:09.653
Great. Give me that.

08:11.757 --> 08:15.284
Great. So, tell me,
what motivated the book?

08:16.329 --> 08:18.627
Uh, my wife died.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.062
I know.

08:22.902 --> 08:24.494
Why tell the whole world
about it?

08:29.442 --> 08:31.535
It was a way to coach myself
how to get through it.

08:31.611 --> 08:33.669
You know, I never
intended for anyone
to actually read it,

08:33.746 --> 08:37.909
but my manager
gave it to a publisher
and here I am.

08:37.984 --> 08:40.645
Yes, you are.
What happened?

08:41.220 --> 08:42.585
Uh...

08:47.059 --> 08:49.323
She was driving us
to dinner.

08:49.896 --> 08:52.194
Dog in the middle
of the road.

08:53.132 --> 08:54.929
Car swerved into a pole.

08:58.104 --> 08:59.901
She died instantly.

09:06.946 --> 09:09.073
It must have been awful.
I'm sorry.

09:10.082 --> 09:12.107
Appreciate it.

09:14.020 --> 09:16.147
Well, I think
I got what I needed.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.520
Great! Fantastic.
Nice to meet you,
Jessica.

09:18.591 --> 09:20.320
Nice to meet you.

09:20.893 --> 09:21.985
You take care.

09:22.061 --> 09:23.050
Thanks.

09:24.797 --> 09:27.061
This way, guys.
Follow Burke.

09:27.133 --> 09:28.998
All right, everybody.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.763
Those of you
who signed up for the
morning work group,

09:30.836 --> 09:32.269
you're in for a treat.

09:32.338 --> 09:33.362
Let's go! Let's go!

09:33.439 --> 09:35.430
Come out in the middle here.
Excuse us.

09:36.208 --> 09:38.836
Thank you.
Excuse us for a second.

09:38.911 --> 09:41.141
Sorry. Come on out here.

09:42.348 --> 09:44.316
Come on, everybody out.

09:44.984 --> 09:47.748
I want you to take
a moment and look around

09:47.820 --> 09:50.516
and tell me what you see
and what you hear.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.615
Okay? All right.

09:53.159 --> 09:54.285
Okay.

09:54.360 --> 09:55.384
Lorraine.

09:55.461 --> 09:57.224
Cars. Honking cars.

09:57.296 --> 09:58.820
Good. Natalie?

09:59.298 --> 10:00.390
Jackhammers.

10:00.466 --> 10:01.763
-Anybody else?
-Stoplights.

10:01.834 --> 10:03.062
Stoplights.
Cement.

10:03.135 --> 10:04.193
A homeless person.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.259
Trash.

10:05.338 --> 10:06.362
Middle fingers.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.599
Good. Excellent.

10:07.673 --> 10:11.040
Now remember that
and follow me.

10:12.211 --> 10:15.078
All right. Now what
do you see? Lorraine?

10:16.115 --> 10:17.548
The ocean.

10:18.484 --> 10:20.042
-Good.
-Trees.

10:20.886 --> 10:21.875
The Space Needle.

10:21.954 --> 10:23.182
Skyscrapers.

10:23.589 --> 10:25.147
Mount Rainier.

10:25.224 --> 10:26.714
Rivers.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.259
Beautiful rivers.

10:28.327 --> 10:29.760
The sun.
Good.

10:29.829 --> 10:31.228
Naked hot-tubber.

10:35.334 --> 10:38.633
Wow. Little bit different
up here, isn't it?

10:38.704 --> 10:41.366
And yet, it's the same.

10:42.541 --> 10:44.634
We haven't gone anywhere.

10:45.645 --> 10:49.012
We're just
looking at things from
a new perspective.

10:50.449 --> 10:56.183
Inside of each of you,
there are sirens,
honking horns and gridlock,

10:58.691 --> 11:02.752
but there's also this.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.525
We just have to do the work

11:07.600 --> 11:10.034
and climb the stairs
to find it.

11:11.370 --> 11:13.998
You have the reporter
at noon and I think
you're gonna like her a lot.

11:14.073 --> 11:15.540
Look, I don't
really give a rat's ass

11:15.608 --> 11:17.007
what your
cancellation policy is.

11:17.076 --> 11:18.566
I am leaving and
I want my money back.

11:18.644 --> 11:20.168
Sir, it's not that simple.
I'll be right back.

11:20.246 --> 11:21.838
Our cancellation
policy clearly...

11:21.914 --> 11:23.677
Hi. Becky?
What seems to be
the trouble here?

11:23.749 --> 11:26.718
Mr. Ryan, this gentleman
is refusing to adhere...

11:26.786 --> 11:28.913
Thank you.
Hi. I'm Burke.

11:29.689 --> 11:30.747
You are?

11:30.823 --> 11:31.949
Walter Mayfield.

11:32.024 --> 11:33.013
Walter. Where you from?

11:33.092 --> 11:34.889
Billings. Drove out
from Billings.

11:34.960 --> 11:36.621
Montana.
That's quite a drive.

11:36.696 --> 11:40.188
Yeah. Look, I don't think
this thing is for me, okay?

11:40.266 --> 11:42.200
Okay. You mind
if I ask why?

11:42.268 --> 11:46.466
Well, frankly,
my sister talked me
into it, and the...

11:46.539 --> 11:49.099
You know the whole...
And the feelings...

11:49.175 --> 11:51.006
I understand.
I understand.

11:51.077 --> 11:53.238
Can I ask you,
why did your sister think

11:53.312 --> 11:55.780
it was so important
for you to come here?

11:58.651 --> 11:59.845
My son.

11:59.919 --> 12:01.853
And what's his name?
Stephen.

12:01.921 --> 12:03.980
And when did he...
Does it really matter?

12:04.056 --> 12:06.786
It matters to me, Walter.
I'd like to hear.

12:12.164 --> 12:14.132
Do you have a picture?

12:32.485 --> 12:33.884
I'm sorry.

12:36.989 --> 12:38.752
Walter, I know
how you feel.
I've been there.

12:40.159 --> 12:42.821
My wife died.
Three years ago.

12:44.864 --> 12:46.354
I want you to know
that you've taken
the first step

12:46.432 --> 12:49.367
just by walking
through these doors,
and something inside you,

12:49.435 --> 12:53.064
whether you know it or not,
made you drive all this way.

12:55.141 --> 12:58.304
If you want to leave,
we'll honor your request.

12:59.311 --> 13:01.074
I hope you don't.

13:04.583 --> 13:07.279
Thanks, Becky.
Think about it.

13:15.060 --> 13:18.052
Chapter two.
Happiness is a state of mind

13:19.265 --> 13:21.893
and, like all things,
it takes practice.

13:21.967 --> 13:26.199
Devote five minutes a day
to smiling, just smiling,

13:28.240 --> 13:31.175
and after a while
it'll come naturally.

13:52.631 --> 13:55.065
Sorry. I didn't mean to...

14:10.316 --> 14:12.409
Hey, you forgot your pen!

14:26.599 --> 14:28.430
Quidnunc? Quidnunc?

14:42.014 --> 14:43.072
What can I get you?

14:43.148 --> 14:47.642
I would like another
Seven-and-Seven,
and a tomato juice

14:47.720 --> 14:48.709
for my virtuous friend here.

14:48.787 --> 14:49.913
Tomato juice.

14:49.989 --> 14:51.616
Thank you.

14:51.690 --> 14:54.591
So, as far as
Unicom knows,

14:54.660 --> 14:58.061
I'm a hair away
from signing a deal
with Time Warner. Okay?

14:58.130 --> 15:00.189
I'm expecting the offer
by lunchtime tomorrow.

15:00.266 --> 15:05.670
That means TV,
radio, publishing.
All of it.

15:06.672 --> 15:09.641
Are you as hot for me
right now as I am hot
for me right now?

15:09.708 --> 15:10.732
So hot.

15:10.809 --> 15:12.003
And check it.

15:12.311 --> 15:16.111
Ted Vernon, the CEO himself,
is gonna fly in
for the end of the seminar.

15:16.181 --> 15:19.344
My guess,
a little warm and fuzzy
contract-inking party.

15:19.418 --> 15:20.817
Who knows?

15:20.886 --> 15:22.353
Your drinks, gentlemen.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.082
Thank you.

15:28.193 --> 15:29.683
It's a long way
from booking you gigs

15:29.762 --> 15:32.287
writing columns
for Psychology Today, huh?

15:39.004 --> 15:41.029
I'll get you a Learjet.

15:41.807 --> 15:42.831
You like Learjets?

15:42.908 --> 15:44.136
Lane.

15:44.910 --> 15:47.674
Come on. You know
that's not why I wrote it.

15:49.515 --> 15:52.973
You do know that
you're helping people,
right, man?

15:57.122 --> 15:58.987
This is your moment.

15:59.758 --> 16:02.784
You have to give
yourself permission
to enjoy it, brother.

16:03.562 --> 16:06.122
Come on, man.
Live a little.

16:06.966 --> 16:07.990
Yeah.

16:08.067 --> 16:09.091
Yeah.

16:15.741 --> 16:16.901
What?

16:34.393 --> 16:35.951
You're right.

16:50.476 --> 16:52.341
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

16:52.945 --> 16:56.642
Hi. Do you remember me?
From the hallway upstairs?

16:56.715 --> 16:58.615
You dropped your pen.

17:00.452 --> 17:01.578
Um...

17:01.987 --> 17:04.751
Would you like to
have a cup of coffee?

17:09.895 --> 17:10.884
Ah.

17:11.296 --> 17:12.558
Right. Um...

17:13.898 --> 17:17.266
Well, we could bring
him along if you want.
Double your pleasure.

17:24.542 --> 17:27.340
I'm sorry.
I... I... You...

17:32.785 --> 17:33.979
See you, Ricky.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.179
Later, Eloise.

17:56.642 --> 17:59.440
Hey, baby. What's this?
Delivery.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.110
Wow.
I was in the
neighborhood,

18:01.180 --> 18:02.545
so I figured
I'd bring you lunch

18:02.614 --> 18:04.639
'cause I knew you'd
be working so hard.

18:04.716 --> 18:05.705
Wow, you didn't
have to do that.

18:05.784 --> 18:07.183
Polished up,
ready to go.

18:07.252 --> 18:08.276
Hey, Eloise.

18:08.353 --> 18:09.445
Hi, Ian.

18:09.988 --> 18:11.717
How's your boss
treating you today?

18:11.790 --> 18:13.485
Oh, he's all right.

18:13.559 --> 18:16.790
The lead singer
of the Stereo Kings
trashed his Les Paul.

18:16.862 --> 18:19.990
Look at that
fretboard, man.
As good as new.

18:20.065 --> 18:21.259
Make sure
he signs for it.

18:21.333 --> 18:22.664
No problem.

18:23.869 --> 18:25.097
Did you have company?

18:26.738 --> 18:27.727
Um...

18:27.840 --> 18:31.332
Yeah. I told you
Frank and I were
working last night.

18:32.344 --> 18:33.971
Frank wears lipstick?

18:35.848 --> 18:37.611
Hey, listen.
EI, it's not
what you think.

18:37.683 --> 18:39.014
It's business.
Totally platonic.

18:39.084 --> 18:40.676
You know what?
You used
that one last time.

18:40.752 --> 18:43.448
No, she's got ties
to Sony. Hey!

18:43.522 --> 18:46.047
Listen to me.
You gotta listen
to me. Eloise!

18:46.125 --> 18:47.956
I don't want to hear it.

20:03.735 --> 20:04.963
How you
doing today?

20:05.037 --> 20:06.470
Pretty good, thanks.

20:06.772 --> 20:08.467
All right. Okay.

20:10.709 --> 20:11.733
What's your name?

20:11.810 --> 20:12.834
Alberto.

20:13.779 --> 20:15.178
See you at workshop,
okay? Goodbye.

20:15.247 --> 20:16.805
Mr. Ryan.

20:17.082 --> 20:19.312
You are something.
Yes, sir.

20:20.419 --> 20:24.480
Say, would you mind
signing that to
"Donald and Shirley," please?

20:25.357 --> 20:26.949
There you go.

20:27.025 --> 20:28.322
Say, do you mind
if I share?

20:28.760 --> 20:29.749
Share?

20:29.828 --> 20:32.490
Yeah. See, there's
this fellow in his 60s

20:32.564 --> 20:36.159
and he thinks
he's just gonna, you know,
sail through his retirement.

20:36.235 --> 20:40.103
But then one day,
three years and
13 days ago,

20:40.172 --> 20:42.367
his daughter dies.

20:43.342 --> 20:46.675
And the truth is
he hasn't been
doing very well.

20:47.446 --> 20:51.075
He doesn't sleep much,
and he and his wife, well...

20:52.484 --> 20:54.076
You can understand.

20:54.152 --> 20:56.780
But his daughter's husband,

20:56.855 --> 20:58.117
well, he doesn't
seem to be having

20:58.190 --> 21:00.124
any of these kinds
of problems. No.

21:00.926 --> 21:05.522
She was crushed
to death in a car crash,
but he, well...

21:07.432 --> 21:11.960
He's making lemonade
out of lemons.
Isn't that how it goes?

21:20.012 --> 21:22.606
When are you gonna
stop lying, son?

21:26.785 --> 21:28.218
Hypocrite.

21:33.492 --> 21:36.290
Burke, I am so sorry.

21:37.529 --> 21:39.861
God. The balls on him!

21:39.931 --> 21:41.159
I'm fine.

21:42.934 --> 21:44.424
Who does he think he is?

21:44.503 --> 21:45.800
Her father.

21:47.873 --> 21:50.467
Even so,
way over the line.

21:52.177 --> 21:55.476
Forget that.
You know what?
She'd be proud of you.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.307
All right,
you're pissed off at me.

21:59.384 --> 22:02.945
A thousand times
you said no to Seattle,
but I wouldn't listen.

22:03.021 --> 22:05.455
You gotta be
pissed off at me.

22:07.125 --> 22:08.490
I'm fine.

22:14.299 --> 22:15.527
Burke?

22:24.142 --> 22:28.408
So, take a good
look at them, mister.
A little preview of tonight.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.809
I know how you love
the high heels.

22:33.418 --> 22:36.581
I'll see you tonight at 8:00.
Standing tall.

22:38.890 --> 22:40.289
Big kiss.

22:41.727 --> 22:43.058
Love you.

22:49.801 --> 22:52.167
"So, my ass don't
fit no Cosmo cover

22:52.237 --> 22:55.434
"You think I can't be
some hot animal lover?

22:55.507 --> 23:00.137
"You scared of my
cerebral cortex? That I'm
Gloria's fish, chromosome X?

23:00.212 --> 23:05.275
"Or maybe you're just afraid
of my battery-operated sex"

23:08.186 --> 23:09.949
What do you think?

23:13.892 --> 23:14.950
Hello.

23:15.026 --> 23:17.119
There's something
wrong with that girl.

23:19.030 --> 23:20.930
She said
she wanted to hear it.

23:20.999 --> 23:24.560
Marty. Slam poetry,
coffee house.

23:24.636 --> 23:27.036
My shop, work. Please.

23:27.105 --> 23:28.595
Yes, ma'am.

23:28.673 --> 23:30.197
Are there any
new receivables?

23:30.275 --> 23:32.971
Just that
birthday arrangement
I told you about.

23:33.044 --> 23:34.602
Right. Great.

23:35.347 --> 23:38.009
Marty, you did not
cauterize the stems.

23:38.083 --> 23:39.209
Oh.

23:39.951 --> 23:42.112
I was just about to.

23:42.187 --> 23:43.654
You know what?
Here's what happens.

23:43.722 --> 23:48.421
The sap pollutes
the water and then
they die twice as fast.

23:48.493 --> 23:51.155
I know,
I know, I know, I know.
I'll get it. I promise.

23:51.229 --> 23:54.960
I don't understand this.
We have roses,
we have all of these.

23:55.033 --> 23:57.433
I mean, come on.
These are flowers
living out of water.

23:57.502 --> 23:58.935
Are you all right?

23:59.004 --> 24:03.441
Look, I just had a really...
I've had a really bad
couple of days, okay?

24:05.377 --> 24:06.639
Would you like to
talk to me about it?

24:06.711 --> 24:08.372
No, I don't.

24:09.948 --> 24:13.145
Because you weren't
this mad the last time
I forgot to cauterize.

24:17.289 --> 24:18.551
Tyler.

24:21.460 --> 24:22.654
And some groupie.

24:22.727 --> 24:23.751
Again?

24:23.829 --> 24:24.818
Yeah.

24:24.896 --> 24:26.921
No. No!

24:26.998 --> 24:28.659
I know. It's crazy.

24:29.034 --> 24:30.831
I can't believe it.

24:32.304 --> 24:35.137
God, you know what?
No, I can believe it.
I can totally believe it.

24:35.207 --> 24:37.402
Excuse me.
What does that mean?
What does that mean?

24:37.476 --> 24:38.568
It's so clear to me.

24:38.643 --> 24:39.632
Oh.

24:40.145 --> 24:42.670
It means that you
manage to choose guys

24:42.747 --> 24:45.215
that guarantee
that at some point,

24:45.283 --> 24:47.080
we are going to be
standing here

24:47.152 --> 24:48.881
having this same
conversation again.

24:48.954 --> 24:54.017
And you're gonna be
shocked at the outcome
of the relationship again.

24:54.092 --> 24:55.184
But most of all,

24:55.260 --> 25:00.596
I just hate seeing you
get so disappointed
and hurt every single time.

25:02.234 --> 25:03.428
Am I being too harsh?

25:03.502 --> 25:04.992
Yes. No.

25:08.473 --> 25:09.497
Yeah.

25:09.574 --> 25:11.804
Yeah. Okay, I'm gonna...

25:11.877 --> 25:13.708
Cauterize.
Yeah.

25:20.619 --> 25:23.486
It was because
they were feeling
pain and resentment.

25:23.555 --> 25:26.718
I want you to re-read
Chapter 12, okay?

25:26.791 --> 25:31.558
The cigarettes are
more than just a habit.
They're a denial mechanism.

25:31.630 --> 25:32.619
Oh.

25:32.697 --> 25:33.891
Okay?

25:35.567 --> 25:37.558
"Mental health
begins with..."

25:37.636 --> 25:40.127
"Physical health." Okay.

25:40.205 --> 25:43.197
And how you always say
it's important to
remember the person,

25:43.275 --> 25:45.903
how they lived,
not how they died?

25:45.977 --> 25:49.913
Well, my husband loved
my oatmeal-raisin
cookies so much.

25:49.981 --> 25:52.074
So, I took his ashes and...

25:54.319 --> 25:55.946
Meet my Stanley.

26:01.393 --> 26:03.623
Don't those
look delicious?

26:06.398 --> 26:08.559
I'll see you in workshop.

26:09.834 --> 26:11.529
Oh, thank him.

26:22.981 --> 26:25.472
...event next week
in the Junior Ballroom.

26:25.684 --> 26:27.845
But then Julie was wondering
if we could get the side...

26:27.919 --> 26:29.147
Excuse me.
...arrangements.
Excuse...

26:29.220 --> 26:32.986
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
there's been a healing.

26:34.793 --> 26:36.454
You like making
a fool of people,

26:36.528 --> 26:38.052
pretending
to be Helen Keller?

26:38.129 --> 26:42.532
Uh, well, technically,
she was blind also, so...

26:42.601 --> 26:45.297
Okay. Will you
excuse us for a second?

26:46.538 --> 26:47.698
Thank you.

26:47.772 --> 26:51.105
See, I happen to know
a thing or two about people.

26:51.176 --> 26:52.473
You get approached a lot.

26:52.544 --> 26:55.104
Probably have since the day
you strapped on your
first training bra.

26:55.180 --> 26:59.082
But you're smart
and you're creative
and you're caring and deep.

26:59.150 --> 27:02.119
But how come
the guys only see
the package it comes in?

27:02.187 --> 27:05.247
Sure, you're flattered,
but ultimately,
ultimately, it's tiresome

27:05.323 --> 27:07.257
because it has
nothing to do with you.
You were born that way.

27:07.325 --> 27:10.726
You can't take credit for it.
Your insides, though.
That's yours.

27:10.795 --> 27:14.356
That's what you want
someone to truly see,
even a stranger.

27:14.432 --> 27:17.663
Ergo, you fake a handicap

27:17.736 --> 27:21.832
rather than deign
to have a conversation
with a fellow human being.

27:21.906 --> 27:24.272
You prefer sign language?
Fine.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.887
Smooth. Real smooth.

27:40.792 --> 27:41.781
Ha!

27:42.661 --> 27:44.356
Excuse me.
This is the men's room.

27:44.429 --> 27:46.363
You know what?
Excuse me.

27:46.698 --> 27:48.791
What did you have in mind?

27:48.867 --> 27:51.893
Some sweet,
romantic courtship

27:51.970 --> 27:53.631
in the bar
over some warm peanuts

27:53.705 --> 27:57.300
before we consummate
our love in the glow
of Spectravision porn?

27:57.375 --> 27:58.399
You...

27:58.476 --> 28:01.104
God, I'm so sorry
your little ego
took such a bruising.

28:01.179 --> 28:05.582
But you know what?
I bet the next chick that
you meet in the elevator

28:05.650 --> 28:07.641
or, I don't know, the gym,

28:07.719 --> 28:09.880
is gonna fit
that bill just fine.
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

28:09.954 --> 28:13.185
Even though I bet
you have a wife who is
actually stupid enough

28:13.258 --> 28:16.523
to believe that
you're the one guy
with integrity. The one guy.

28:16.594 --> 28:19.791
Until, of course,
she finds that lipstick mark
on your boxers,

28:19.864 --> 28:21.764
and then it's
game over, pal.

28:21.833 --> 28:23.130
And that one thing
that you held so dear,

28:23.201 --> 28:25.362
that one thing
that you loved more than
anything in the world,

28:25.437 --> 28:29.032
is tainted and ruined
and destroyed like that.

28:30.575 --> 28:33.203
Ergo, if you had
a brain in either head,

28:33.278 --> 28:35.803
you would realize that
I was doing us both a favor.

28:45.857 --> 28:46.846
Excuse me.

28:46.925 --> 28:48.017
Sure. No problem.

28:52.063 --> 28:53.360
Is that my flower
you're wearing?

28:54.132 --> 28:55.258
No.

28:57.102 --> 28:59.502
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, it is.

29:01.906 --> 29:05.535
But I... I took it before,
when I thought you were deaf.

29:06.444 --> 29:07.570
Hmm?

29:07.645 --> 29:09.340
Not that I would steal
from a deaf person.

29:10.448 --> 29:11.574
All right.

29:12.951 --> 29:14.248
Goodbye.

29:16.888 --> 29:18.446
My God.

29:32.504 --> 29:34.734
All right,
this one's ready.

29:35.273 --> 29:36.900
Where's that headed?
Don't know.

29:36.975 --> 29:39.705
He said you'd know
where it was going.

30:03.635 --> 30:04.761
Hi.

30:06.371 --> 30:07.429
Hi.

30:08.373 --> 30:09.465
Don't you look grand?

30:09.541 --> 30:12.442
Thank you.
My, my, fancy.

30:13.511 --> 30:15.502
Thank you.
All right.

30:19.484 --> 30:22.180
The concierge
said it's good.

30:22.654 --> 30:24.519
That's good.
He should know.

30:24.989 --> 30:26.320
Yeah.

30:33.765 --> 30:35.062
It stopped raining.

30:35.433 --> 30:36.730
It sure did.

30:42.207 --> 30:45.370
Carrot-ginger and
the spinach soup.

30:49.414 --> 30:51.644
You know, I have to say,
I have never been
on a date with someone

30:51.716 --> 30:54.014
who has a cardboard
cutout of themselves.

30:54.085 --> 30:55.416
Well, I mean, they're...
They're really...

30:55.486 --> 30:57.386
They're good
for the carpool lane.

30:57.989 --> 30:58.978
Oh.

31:00.491 --> 31:01.549
Got it.

31:01.626 --> 31:05.687
You know, we take long walks
on the beach together,
go fly kites.

31:06.264 --> 31:07.822
He's the kite.

31:08.766 --> 31:10.757
Because he's cardboard.
Right.

31:15.273 --> 31:17.434
Your salads. Enjoy.

31:17.508 --> 31:18.941
Thank you.
Thank you.

31:21.746 --> 31:22.838
So...

31:25.650 --> 31:26.981
"Quidnunc"?

31:27.986 --> 31:29.317
Yeah.

31:29.921 --> 31:33.721
You weren't really
supposed to see that,
but, you know...

31:33.791 --> 31:36.351
They're just...
They're just words.

31:37.562 --> 31:39.393
So, there's
more than one, or...

31:39.464 --> 31:40.453
Mmm-mmm.

31:51.042 --> 31:52.441
Thank you.

31:57.382 --> 32:00.545
Well, your
concierge called it.
That was real good.

32:00.618 --> 32:01.846
Right.
Thank you.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.410
My pleasure.

32:04.789 --> 32:07.986
So, I gotta...
I'm gonna go.
I've got...

32:08.059 --> 32:09.924
It's a school night
for me, so...

32:09.994 --> 32:11.154
I understand.

32:11.229 --> 32:12.491
It was very nice.
Thank you. Okay.

32:12.563 --> 32:14.326
All right.
Thank you. Great.

32:14.399 --> 32:16.663
Goodbye.
See you later. Thanks.

32:23.174 --> 32:24.505
Eloise!

32:26.177 --> 32:27.166
Eloise!

32:27.245 --> 32:28.234
Oh.

32:31.716 --> 32:35.812
You know, I haven't...
I haven't been on a date
in three years.

32:37.121 --> 32:39.954
'Cause see, I was...
I was married.

32:40.024 --> 32:45.326
And I mean, normally,
I'm... I'm quite
dashing and debonair

32:45.396 --> 32:48.229
and whatever other
"D" word there is

32:48.299 --> 32:49.288
that would
really impress you.

32:49.367 --> 32:52.359
But it's painfully
apparent that I'm...
I'm a little rusty.

32:54.339 --> 32:57.467
Why... Why wouldn't you
just say so?

32:58.409 --> 33:00.969
I don't know,
a desperate attempt
to hold on to

33:01.045 --> 33:03.513
whatever shred of masculinity
that I have left?

33:05.049 --> 33:06.539
Okay. So...

33:08.920 --> 33:12.253
So then I'm your...
I'm your first
since a divorce?

33:13.391 --> 33:16.383
Uh, you are the first...
Well, that's good.

33:16.461 --> 33:19.988
Because that explains a lot.
Because that in there...

33:21.132 --> 33:22.497
It was... It was bad.

33:22.567 --> 33:23.829
Really bad.

33:26.037 --> 33:30.565
Well, I have to go
pick some phalangiums
right now.

33:30.641 --> 33:33.041
Would you like to
come with me?

33:34.078 --> 33:35.067
Yeah.

33:35.713 --> 33:36.702
Good.

33:46.624 --> 33:50.287
Personally, I like
to put the waffles
and bacon in first.

33:50.795 --> 33:52.626
I'm increasing
the pH level.

33:52.697 --> 33:55.029
Hey. You do your thing.

33:56.234 --> 34:00.295
I'm still trying to
wrap my head around
what your thing is.

34:00.371 --> 34:02.931
You're just gonna
have to read my book.

34:03.007 --> 34:04.634
You're slippery.

34:04.776 --> 34:06.437
I prefer "mysterious."

34:10.915 --> 34:12.143
How long you
been at this?

34:12.216 --> 34:14.081
Oh, I've always
wanted to do it.

34:14.851 --> 34:17.844
I finally got up the guts
a couple of years ago
to open my own shop.

34:17.922 --> 34:19.480
Good for you.

34:22.326 --> 34:24.385
"Julie, we have
never met..."

34:24.462 --> 34:26.123
No. Hey!

34:26.197 --> 34:28.130
Wow. Nosy.

34:29.233 --> 34:30.291
I'm sorry.

34:30.368 --> 34:31.460
Sorry. I don't mean to...

34:31.536 --> 34:35.266
But these are just...
They're from deliveries.

34:35.339 --> 34:38.239
They're copies I've made
of cards that have,

34:38.309 --> 34:40.004
you know, stuck with me.

34:41.646 --> 34:43.045
So...
Can I...

34:43.114 --> 34:44.911
Really?
Would you...
Yeah. I'd like to.

34:44.982 --> 34:46.074
Okay.

34:46.784 --> 34:49.446
"Julie, we have never met,

34:51.289 --> 34:54.417
"but I've watched
you lovingly
all these years.

34:54.492 --> 34:57.950
"Congratulations
and have a beautiful wedding.

34:59.664 --> 35:01.529
"Love, your father."

35:06.037 --> 35:07.299
May I?

35:07.472 --> 35:08.564
Um...

35:13.744 --> 35:15.177
Let's see.

35:15.246 --> 35:19.342
"Stacy, these are supposed
to last two weeks.

35:19.417 --> 35:21.908
"I'll be back in time
to see them bloom."

35:21.986 --> 35:25.217
Yeah, deployed Marine.
He never saw them bloom.

35:31.129 --> 35:32.221
One last one.

35:32.296 --> 35:34.890
"My dearest wife,
happy 50th anniversary.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.934
"Sorry about
the rug burns last night."

35:38.736 --> 35:40.704
Thanks for the visual.

35:42.340 --> 35:44.103
Life on a 3-by-5.

36:00.758 --> 36:04.159
Okay, well,
I mean, if this is
the candle of truth,

36:07.265 --> 36:09.699
then I guess
I should be honest.

36:12.637 --> 36:15.265
I... I used her
life insurance money

36:17.408 --> 36:20.241
for a down payment
on a condo in Mexico.

36:21.279 --> 36:25.238
Well, because we had
talked about it before.
He liked the idea.

36:26.083 --> 36:31.487
So, I... I made
a mold of his, you know...

36:33.357 --> 36:37.794
That way, when he was gone,
we could still, you know...

36:41.499 --> 36:42.966
Who's next?

36:49.307 --> 36:50.569
Walter?

36:54.278 --> 36:56.337
Not much to say, really.

36:58.115 --> 37:01.846
Walter, there's always
something to say.
Come on, tell us.

37:03.888 --> 37:05.378
How did your son die?

37:16.133 --> 37:19.933
I used to be a contractor.
He was my little
right-hand man.

37:21.572 --> 37:26.669
Only 12, but he could
frame a garden shed
better than I could.

37:27.912 --> 37:29.607
We stopped by my
construction site.

37:29.680 --> 37:32.171
I had to pick up
some blueprints
from my trailer.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.081
I told him to
wait in the car.

37:34.151 --> 37:37.848
He fell off a scaffold
and snapped his
spinal cord in two.

37:51.569 --> 37:53.059
Just like...

37:54.972 --> 37:56.599
Just like that.

37:59.644 --> 38:01.339
And every day...

38:03.714 --> 38:05.341
Every day is...

38:09.487 --> 38:12.547
I should've known
he wouldn't stay
in the car.

38:19.897 --> 38:23.333
Walter, you said,
"I used to be a contractor."

38:29.840 --> 38:33.207
I can't even walk
into a hardware store.

38:36.080 --> 38:39.538
I clean buildings
at night now.

38:42.453 --> 38:44.478
And I lost my business.

38:45.856 --> 38:47.551
My wife left me.

38:51.896 --> 38:53.659
Thank you, Walter.

39:01.305 --> 39:04.866
There's a dirty
little secret.
It's fear.

39:06.644 --> 39:09.112
How many here
don't fly anymore?

39:10.247 --> 39:12.374
Come on, raise your hands.

39:13.017 --> 39:16.350
Who here gets
an annual checkup
three times a year?

39:19.557 --> 39:21.422
How many of you
don't take elevators

39:21.492 --> 39:25.724
or gave up skiing,
biking, surfing, kayaking,
whatever it might be?

39:28.265 --> 39:33.293
Well, listen to me.
Fear is a state of mind.

39:34.905 --> 39:37.373
We're gonna prove
that right now.

39:39.310 --> 39:41.608
Let's put
our hands together.

39:45.816 --> 39:48.410
Ready? Here we go.

39:52.123 --> 39:54.216
Step, step, step, step.

39:55.726 --> 39:57.751
Okay? Come on, Natalie.

40:16.414 --> 40:20.248
The only thing
separating you and me
is in your head.

40:20.317 --> 40:23.616
Come on.
You can do this.
Come on.

40:25.089 --> 40:27.319
Okay. Walter?

40:28.125 --> 40:30.821
-Come on, Walter!
-Come on, Walter!

40:31.028 --> 40:32.427
Here we go!

40:32.496 --> 40:34.225
Come on, Walter!

40:37.935 --> 40:39.334
Here we go.

40:39.403 --> 40:41.371
Come on, Walter!

40:42.239 --> 40:43.536
Come on!

40:44.074 --> 40:45.336
Walter.

40:46.310 --> 40:47.868
It's okay. It's okay.

40:47.945 --> 40:51.108
I'm sorry.
This is just silly.

40:51.182 --> 40:52.672
I'm not gonna
feel A-Okay

40:52.750 --> 40:54.718
because I walked
across some damn coals.

40:55.319 --> 40:58.049
Okay, then it shouldn't be
that big of a deal, Walter.

40:58.155 --> 40:59.679
It's not a big deal.
It's just...

40:59.757 --> 41:01.247
It's a step.

41:01.325 --> 41:03.293
It's an important step.

41:04.094 --> 41:07.427
Well, it has nothing
to do with my Stephen.

41:07.498 --> 41:10.365
Walter, would Stephen
want you like this?

41:11.502 --> 41:15.063
Or would he
want you to move on,
to take a step forward?

41:17.441 --> 41:19.841
You don't know
anything about my son.

41:19.910 --> 41:21.537
Walter, watch.

41:34.124 --> 41:35.853
Walter, come on.

41:44.702 --> 41:47.102
Come on, Walter.
You can do this.

41:50.241 --> 41:51.606
Come on.

41:52.810 --> 41:54.175
Walter!

41:59.817 --> 42:02.786
Okay. All right,
we all go at our own pace.

42:03.621 --> 42:05.282
He'll get there.

42:06.323 --> 42:08.188
All right, well,
let's give ourselves
a round of applause

42:10.160 --> 42:13.220
for daring to kick fear
right where it hurts.

42:17.001 --> 42:20.300
Buddy, this stuff
is gonna hurt.

42:26.010 --> 42:27.978
How many layers of skin
do you think you have?

42:29.680 --> 42:31.204
Not enough.

42:33.684 --> 42:36.915
You know, you can't
do the work for them.

42:37.855 --> 42:38.913
You know that, right?

42:38.989 --> 42:40.422
The guy needs help.

42:41.659 --> 42:43.854
Fine, but you can't
do it for them.

42:45.095 --> 42:46.494
This is gonna
sting a little bit.

42:48.299 --> 42:49.527
Ready?

42:51.502 --> 42:53.094
Count of three.

42:53.804 --> 42:54.828
One.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.504
Lane! You're fired!

43:02.046 --> 43:05.345
Once you sign
with us, you're no longer
an independent contractor.

43:05.416 --> 43:09.182
You've got all 32 divisions
funneling your image 24-7.

43:09.253 --> 43:13.622
Within a year, we’ll
increase your household
name recognition by 65%.

43:13.691 --> 43:17.252
The Burke Ryan Show
will subsequently launch
in the third quarter.

43:17.328 --> 43:19.592
Followed by
the DVD line,
a new set of books,

43:19.663 --> 43:21.961
syndicated
talk radio, et cetera.

43:22.132 --> 43:23.258
"Et cetera" is good.

43:23.334 --> 43:26.462
All of this
lays the foundation
for a branding strategy

43:26.537 --> 43:29.438
that taps into demographics
well beyond your current base.

43:29.506 --> 43:32.441
Studies indicate
that persons grieving
the loss of a loved one

43:32.509 --> 43:35.967
put on 30 to 40%
more weight than
the national average.

43:36.046 --> 43:40.346
Introducing
the Burke Ryan
Calorie Reduction Plan.

43:41.485 --> 43:45.046
"Finally, a loss you
can feel good about."

43:45.155 --> 43:46.349
Ooh.

43:47.324 --> 43:49.849
Look at that.
I like that picture.

43:51.629 --> 43:53.961
Wow. Are you kidding me?

43:55.733 --> 43:57.030
You look strong,
you look happy and...

43:57.101 --> 43:58.159
Right.

43:58.235 --> 44:01.170
It's a mock-up at this point.
Anyway, continuing on...

44:29.900 --> 44:31.663
Hey, that was great.
Don't forget,

44:31.735 --> 44:33.862
when Mr. Vernon
gets into town...

44:33.937 --> 44:35.700
Hey, I gotta take them
down to the museum

44:35.773 --> 44:37.968
and show them
around like an idiot...

44:38.542 --> 44:43.411
Did that beep?
Hey, Burke.
It's me, Eloise.

44:47.117 --> 44:48.675
So, where are we going?

44:48.819 --> 44:50.377
It's all good.
You'll see.

45:01.298 --> 45:04.358
Okay, I will be right back.

45:05.202 --> 45:06.897
Is this...
Is this your house?

45:06.970 --> 45:08.232
No, it's my mom's.

45:08.305 --> 45:10.773
I'm just gonna
go grab something.

45:11.775 --> 45:13.242
I mean, you're
more than welcome
to come in.

45:13.310 --> 45:14.572
Okay.

45:16.046 --> 45:17.206
Okay.

45:18.982 --> 45:20.040
Hi, Mom.

45:20.117 --> 45:21.448
Oh. Hi, honey.

45:21.618 --> 45:23.142
Bob left the keys
on the counter.

45:23.220 --> 45:24.710
Oh, great.

45:25.789 --> 45:27.484
Great. How was your day?

45:27.558 --> 45:30.186
Oh, fine. I had
lots of coupons.

45:30.260 --> 45:32.751
Oh, really?
So, that was busy, huh?

45:33.130 --> 45:34.119
Mmm-hmm.

45:35.199 --> 45:37.667
Hi. I brought you flowers.

45:37.735 --> 45:40.203
Oh. Those are
so pretty. Thanks.

45:41.205 --> 45:44.299
Mom, I'd like you
to meet a friend of mine.

45:44.374 --> 45:46.535
I wasn't expecting company.

45:47.511 --> 45:50.139
Hi. I'm Burke.

45:51.248 --> 45:52.840
Burke Ryan!

45:53.917 --> 45:56.215
Ellie, you didn't tell me
you were dating a celebrity.

45:56.286 --> 45:58.277
Well, we're not dating.

45:58.889 --> 46:00.652
I wish you would have told me.
I look like hell.

46:00.724 --> 46:02.954
Not at all.
It's just the opposite.

46:03.026 --> 46:05.153
I see where Eloise
gets her looks.

46:07.364 --> 46:08.729
Let's show him
your pictures.

46:08.799 --> 46:09.823
You know,
no, I don't think so...

46:09.900 --> 46:10.889
I'd love to.

46:10.968 --> 46:12.492
No, really.

46:14.071 --> 46:16.938
You know... Okay,
I'm gonna get the keys.

46:17.007 --> 46:19.373
My word, you have
Pocahontas here.

46:19.443 --> 46:22.469
Eloise was state
archery champion
two years in a row.

46:22.546 --> 46:24.036
No.
Oh, Mother.

46:24.114 --> 46:26.981
Don't be modest.
This is Burke Ryan.

46:28.919 --> 46:31.251
I loved you
on The Today Show.

46:32.289 --> 46:33.756
Now how old is she here?

46:33.824 --> 46:35.849
Okay. I got those keys,
so thank you for that.

46:35.926 --> 46:37.860
We gotta go.
Look how cute
you are here.

46:37.928 --> 46:39.953
A-Okay.
A-Okay.

46:40.297 --> 46:41.924
It was very nice
meeting you.
Nice to meet you.

46:41.999 --> 46:44.524
Hope to see you again.
Yeah. Take care. Bye-bye.

46:45.903 --> 46:47.996
I am so glad
you're not dating
that musician.

46:48.071 --> 46:49.436
Mother. Oh, God.

46:54.344 --> 46:56.437
I love you.
Thanks. Thank Bob.

46:58.182 --> 47:00.275
Burke Ryan.
Oh, my God!

47:01.585 --> 47:03.109
Wow.
She's so sweet.

47:03.187 --> 47:04.484
She loves you.

47:04.555 --> 47:05.715
I really enjoyed that.

47:05.789 --> 47:07.347
It was very sweet.

47:09.393 --> 47:13.022
Oh, Mom. No, no, no.
This way. Come on.

47:14.064 --> 47:15.691
Where are we going?

47:16.633 --> 47:18.123
It's fun not knowing,
isn't it?

47:18.202 --> 47:19.191
Ah.

47:19.303 --> 47:20.998
You’ll see.

47:23.407 --> 47:25.671
What, are you trying
to avoid the FBI?

47:25.742 --> 47:28.836
You’ll see. Please,
just get in the truck.

47:35.986 --> 47:37.317
I think I forgot
my hard hat.

47:37.387 --> 47:39.787
Oh, really?
Well, here you go.

47:59.509 --> 48:01.204
What you doing?

48:01.812 --> 48:04.144
Your chariot awaits.

48:05.616 --> 48:07.982
Seriously?
Me, in bucket?

48:08.685 --> 48:10.619
Yes. Trust me.

48:14.892 --> 48:17.656
Have you had any
cold medicine today?

48:17.728 --> 48:19.286
Not today.

48:19.363 --> 48:20.853
We're good.
Okay, now watch this.

48:20.931 --> 48:22.523
Very dangerous.
Fingers.
Uh-huh.

48:22.599 --> 48:24.931
Lock us in. Got it?

48:25.002 --> 48:26.196
Do you know
what you're doing?
Uh-huh.

48:26.270 --> 48:27.362
Ready?
Oh, Lord.

48:27.437 --> 48:28.665
Are we in? Buckled?

48:28.739 --> 48:30.229
Locked? Loaded?
Okay.

48:31.942 --> 48:35.639
All right, here lies
Burke Ryan, dead...

48:36.580 --> 48:40.573
Oh, stop it.
I had a crash course
this morning from Bob.

48:40.651 --> 48:43.085
Who is Bob, and why is
my life in his hands?

48:43.153 --> 48:45.280
Bob's my mom's neighbor.

48:45.355 --> 48:47.550
Current boyfriend
of the moment.

48:47.624 --> 48:49.114
Mmm-hmm.

48:49.760 --> 48:51.625
Okay. Here's
what I was thinking.

48:51.762 --> 48:53.662
I wanted to pick up
from last night.

48:54.865 --> 48:57.356
And I wanted to
get you tickets
to Rogue Wave,

48:57.434 --> 49:00.062
but they've been
sold out for weeks.

49:01.204 --> 49:05.698
So, I figured
where there is a will,
there is a way.

49:21.525 --> 49:24.119
Heaven is a switchboard
that you want to fight

49:24.194 --> 49:26.458
She would even miss you
if you taught her sight

49:26.530 --> 49:28.794
Power politician
leaning to the right

49:28.865 --> 49:32.733
Baby's got a trust fund
that she'll want to go off
like that

49:32.803 --> 49:35.203
Get off my stack

49:35.272 --> 49:37.035
leave a little window

49:37.107 --> 49:40.042
Get off of my stack

49:47.851 --> 49:49.751
Now we wear
same-colored yellow uniforms

49:49.820 --> 49:51.082
Sky is burning
but at least we're warm

50:00.497 --> 50:02.590
If I had a nickel
for every time
I saw a concert

50:02.666 --> 50:04.998
from a telephone truck,
I'd be...

50:05.969 --> 50:08.199
Thank you.
It was exquisite.

50:08.271 --> 50:10.102
Don't thank me.
Thank Bob.

50:10.173 --> 50:11.606
Thank you, Bob.

50:12.442 --> 50:14.342
Hey, I got your book.

50:14.411 --> 50:15.400
I'm halfway through it.

50:15.479 --> 50:16.605
Really?

50:17.247 --> 50:19.909
Well, wait till you get
to the recipe chapters.

50:19.983 --> 50:21.780
They're top-notch.

50:25.455 --> 50:27.548
I'm sorry
about your wife.

50:29.192 --> 50:31.854
How come you didn't tell me
that's what happened?

50:34.164 --> 50:36.428
I don't know.
Never came up.

50:39.102 --> 50:41.593
Well, it sounded like
you really loved her.

50:43.340 --> 50:44.830
Yeah, I did.

50:46.710 --> 50:48.268
But that was
a long time ago.

50:49.646 --> 50:51.136
Three years?

50:51.848 --> 50:53.645
Twenty-one in dog years.

50:58.221 --> 51:01.952
I had a really,
really great time.

51:02.859 --> 51:05.054
Me, too.
That was really fun.

51:19.176 --> 51:20.473
What?

51:20.877 --> 51:24.779
I'm waiting
to watch you strut back
to your bitchin' rig.

51:28.785 --> 51:30.116
All right.

51:31.555 --> 51:32.544
Bye.

52:10.001 --> 52:12.993
Is that the international
song for "got laid"?

52:13.605 --> 52:15.095
No! Hardly.

52:15.507 --> 52:18.806
Come on, throw me a bone.
What happened last night?

52:19.277 --> 52:20.767
It was fun.

52:21.580 --> 52:23.605
So, are you going
to see him again?

52:23.682 --> 52:26.276
I don't know. Maybe.

52:29.121 --> 52:33.353
May I just point out
that you broke up
with Tyler 72 hours ago

52:33.425 --> 52:35.154
and now you're dating
some other guy

52:35.227 --> 52:37.457
who's not even gonna be
in town for 72 hours?

52:37.529 --> 52:38.757
Can I just point that out?

52:38.830 --> 52:40.991
Okay, we're...
We're not dating.

52:41.399 --> 52:46.530
We just met and,
you know, I like him.

52:48.073 --> 52:49.973
We're just hanging out.

52:51.009 --> 52:52.943
Well, just be careful.

52:53.678 --> 52:56.442
Men are hairy.

52:57.582 --> 52:59.413
Thank you for that.

54:47.993 --> 54:50.461
Two minutes.
Give him two minutes.

54:51.596 --> 54:53.791
He gets called away
for emergencies, you know.

55:01.072 --> 55:04.371
"Her freckles frame eyes
the color of mermaid's tears

55:04.442 --> 55:08.310
"Her ears like waking up
to the sound of
children at play"

55:08.380 --> 55:11.645
"My first five senses are
reeling like an old-school
cassette tape

55:11.716 --> 55:15.208
"rewound and played
electric relaxation all day"

55:15.287 --> 55:19.121
"You and your phallus
may run this world

55:19.190 --> 55:23.957
"But this Amazon bitch
will cut you down to size!"

55:26.631 --> 55:28.064
Thank you.

55:35.540 --> 55:37.303
That was slamming.

55:37.676 --> 55:40.201
Thank you.
I tried to mix up
the iambic pentameter

55:40.278 --> 55:42.542
with a little
haiku motif.

55:42.614 --> 55:45.048
Kick-ass, Mart. Drink?

55:45.116 --> 55:46.583
Yeah, all around, on me.

55:46.651 --> 55:50.747
And can we have more
of the Istanbul Black
Demon shisha, please?

55:50.822 --> 55:51.880
Black Demon?

55:51.956 --> 55:54.447
Thank you. So wicked.
Want to try it?

55:54.526 --> 55:55.686
-Go ahead, try it.
-Okay.

55:55.760 --> 55:57.022
"Try me."

55:59.097 --> 56:00.291
Sure.

56:13.878 --> 56:17.006
Shit. Excuse me
for one second,
will you?

56:17.215 --> 56:18.944
Who is that man?

56:25.457 --> 56:28.119
I beg you, please
make sense of this.

56:28.360 --> 56:30.328
I'm just enjoying
a little local flavor.

56:30.395 --> 56:32.863
Since when do you
enjoy anything?

56:32.931 --> 56:34.398
How did you even find me?

56:34.466 --> 56:36.957
I'm Lane goddamn Marshall,
okay?

56:38.203 --> 56:39.670
You asked directions
from your concierge.

56:39.738 --> 56:40.830
What is going on here?

56:40.905 --> 56:43.373
We're on the verge
of the deal
of the century here

56:43.441 --> 56:45.033
and you're off playing
Prince of Persia.

56:45.110 --> 56:46.941
Drinks, gentlemen?
No. Get out of here.

56:47.011 --> 56:48.569
Hey, Lane.

56:48.646 --> 56:51.046
No, thank you.
Will you calm down?

56:51.116 --> 56:52.947
I will not calm down.

56:53.017 --> 56:55.611
Their CEO is coming
in two days.

56:57.222 --> 56:59.713
Do you have any idea
the blood, sweat and tears

56:59.791 --> 57:02.225
it's taken me to put
this thing together?

57:02.293 --> 57:04.989
You know, Unicom didn't
even know your name
six months ago.

57:05.063 --> 57:06.325
I know and I appreciate it.

57:06.831 --> 57:07.820
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.

57:07.899 --> 57:10.026
No, you don't!
Lane.

57:10.101 --> 57:11.762
Friend to friend,

57:13.605 --> 57:15.505
do you not want this?

57:20.979 --> 57:22.378
You can tell me.

57:26.518 --> 57:29.715
Look, I'm ready.

57:30.321 --> 57:31.413
Okay?

57:31.489 --> 57:32.513
So, for the next two days,
you're gonna be

57:32.590 --> 57:34.820
where I tell you to be
when I tell you to be there?

57:36.060 --> 57:37.789
Yes. Scout's honor.

57:38.897 --> 57:40.762
You with the scouting.

57:41.666 --> 57:42.997
Oh, God.

57:44.035 --> 57:45.434
Will you relax?
You're gonna have
a heart attack.

57:45.503 --> 57:48.472
I had a heart attack.
I had four heart attacks
on the way here.

57:51.709 --> 57:54.803
So, who are these
fine folks that you're
consorting with?

57:55.814 --> 57:59.113
Just people I've met.

58:00.885 --> 58:01.977
Yeah?

58:05.290 --> 58:06.951
Her name's Eloise.

58:07.258 --> 58:10.318
Well, what hath
struck the earth?
Details.

58:12.497 --> 58:13.828
She's...

58:16.067 --> 58:17.227
Yeah?

58:21.206 --> 58:22.969
That's great.
Yeah.

58:23.041 --> 58:24.065
That's great.

58:24.142 --> 58:25.268
So, I'm gonna get back.

58:25.343 --> 58:26.810
Yeah, we'd better.

58:32.350 --> 58:36.684
All right, yo,
a pleasure to meet you guys.
Welcome to the rainy city.

58:38.423 --> 58:40.482
Should I belly dance?

59:58.570 --> 01:00:02.506
It's tragic.
They were so young.

01:00:02.574 --> 01:00:03.905
It's just so sad.

01:00:03.975 --> 01:00:04.999
I know.

01:00:05.476 --> 01:00:08.536
I don't know how you
deal with all that
death every day.

01:00:08.613 --> 01:00:11.047
Well, I have to deal
with it no matter what.

01:00:12.350 --> 01:00:16.582
I think that
funerals are archaic
and a waste of money.

01:00:17.221 --> 01:00:22.386
Actually, funerals
are an important ritual
in the grieving process.

01:00:23.394 --> 01:00:26.761
They don't just recognize
that a life has ended.

01:00:26.831 --> 01:00:29.698
They recognize
that a life was lived.

01:00:30.735 --> 01:00:32.600
My wife's funeral...

01:00:33.237 --> 01:00:34.761
Burke, you don't
have to.

01:00:34.839 --> 01:00:35.863
No, it's okay.
That's okay.

01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:40.604
Which was actually
here in Seattle,
was a celebration.

01:00:41.112 --> 01:00:43.080
It was a beautiful day
in March,

01:00:43.147 --> 01:00:44.739
St. Patrick's Day, actually.

01:00:44.816 --> 01:00:46.875
And her family
has a little plot,

01:00:46.951 --> 01:00:48.919
so we set up
chairs and candles.

01:00:48.987 --> 01:00:53.083
And it had been raining
for two weeks straight.
Pouring.

01:00:53.157 --> 01:00:55.318
But on that day,
the sun came out.

01:00:55.393 --> 01:00:57.088
The dahlias were
blooming in the ground

01:00:57.161 --> 01:00:58.753
as if they were
welcoming her.

01:00:58.830 --> 01:01:01.697
It was... It was magic.

01:01:05.169 --> 01:01:07.603
That was a healing
for my family.

01:01:15.613 --> 01:01:16.944
Dahlias?

01:01:19.417 --> 01:01:20.748
Dahlias.

01:01:21.586 --> 01:01:24.282
Dahlias. That was
her favorite flower.

01:01:27.091 --> 01:01:29.821
Dahlias don't bloom
here until the fall.

01:01:31.996 --> 01:01:34.624
Well, maybe they were
early that year.

01:01:35.333 --> 01:01:36.698
It's getting late.

01:01:36.768 --> 01:01:38.668
We should hit
the road, Burke.

01:01:53.418 --> 01:01:54.612
He didn't go, did he?

01:02:04.762 --> 01:02:05.990
No.

01:03:04.388 --> 01:03:05.377
Oh.

01:03:06.190 --> 01:03:07.987
So beautiful here.

01:03:09.694 --> 01:03:12.561
Look. Look, you can
see my parents' house.

01:03:13.264 --> 01:03:15.323
Right... Yeah, right there.

01:03:17.135 --> 01:03:18.762
Okay, your turn.

01:03:19.036 --> 01:03:22.130
Big smile. Time for
that tourist snapshot.

01:03:22.907 --> 01:03:25.205
It's gonna go
right on the wall
in the living room.

01:03:28.346 --> 01:03:30.712
You're not smiling.
Would you smile, please?

01:03:31.749 --> 01:03:35.378
Okay, three, two, one.

01:03:36.053 --> 01:03:37.486
Say "cheese."

01:04:37.248 --> 01:04:40.183
Recovery starts with
acceptance, Olivia.

01:04:40.251 --> 01:04:43.220
I think you're
well on your way.
Okay. Good.

01:04:43.421 --> 01:04:45.252
Who's next? Anybody?

01:04:46.290 --> 01:04:48.622
Come on, people,
this is what these
smaller sessions are for.

01:04:48.693 --> 01:04:50.718
Let's get our hands up.
Come on, participate.

01:04:54.031 --> 01:04:55.658
Martha, please.

01:04:57.368 --> 01:04:58.392
I don't know. I...

01:04:58.469 --> 01:05:00.596
No, Martha, "I don't know"
never got anybody anywhere.

01:05:00.671 --> 01:05:03.162
So, please,
this is your assessment.

01:05:04.108 --> 01:05:06.508
Let's make
the most of it, okay?

01:05:07.945 --> 01:05:10.345
I think
I'm coming to terms
with some of my anger.

01:05:10.414 --> 01:05:11.938
Good.
And I'm gonna try

01:05:12.016 --> 01:05:13.608
to stop projecting it
onto others.

01:05:13.684 --> 01:05:15.948
Fine. Work on that
in group this afternoon.

01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:18.853
All right?
All right, next. Anybody.

01:05:21.559 --> 01:05:24.187
Come on, people.
Walter, how about you?

01:05:26.831 --> 01:05:28.890
I feel I'm getting
a lot out of the seminar.

01:05:28.966 --> 01:05:30.729
Like what?

01:05:31.402 --> 01:05:33.962
Come on, there's
no right answer here.
Open up.

01:05:34.972 --> 01:05:36.234
Well...

01:05:37.742 --> 01:05:39.266
It's just...

01:05:41.345 --> 01:05:43.905
It still hurts.

01:05:43.981 --> 01:05:46.916
Okay, that's a given, Walter.
What are you doing about it?

01:05:48.185 --> 01:05:49.243
I'm trying.

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:52.881
No, Walter. I don't think that
you're trying hard enough.

01:05:52.957 --> 01:05:54.549
I don't know
how to try any harder.

01:05:54.625 --> 01:05:56.320
You don't know how?

01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:58.926
You don't know how?
Have I not been up here
the last three days?

01:05:58.996 --> 01:06:00.224
Have you not been
listening to me?

01:06:00.298 --> 01:06:01.822
I mean, you don't know
how, Walter?

01:06:01.899 --> 01:06:03.298
No, I...
Then spit it out!

01:06:03.367 --> 01:06:05.028
Come on, what is it?
What is it?

01:06:05.102 --> 01:06:06.364
You want to know what?

01:06:06.437 --> 01:06:08.530
He should be pitching
Little League right now.

01:06:09.407 --> 01:06:11.967
If he'd stayed in the car,
he'd be playing video games,

01:06:12.043 --> 01:06:13.943
he'd be spray-painting
his skateboard,

01:06:14.011 --> 01:06:15.842
he'd be pissing me off
by being a kid,

01:06:15.913 --> 01:06:17.278
but he's never
gonna do any of that

01:06:17.348 --> 01:06:19.407
because he's
in a goddamn box!

01:06:57.521 --> 01:06:58.852
Walter.

01:07:02.893 --> 01:07:04.520
You're stuck.

01:07:06.163 --> 01:07:07.562
You can't move
forward because

01:07:07.631 --> 01:07:09.792
you've got your eyes
on the rearview mirror.

01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:16.005
The death of your son has
become the death of you,

01:07:17.041 --> 01:07:20.977
your marriage,
your job. Everything.

01:07:23.547 --> 01:07:25.037
It's just...

01:07:28.652 --> 01:07:30.984
I don't know
how to get it back.

01:07:34.592 --> 01:07:36.219
You're a contractor, right?

01:07:39.363 --> 01:07:40.421
Build it.

01:07:41.332 --> 01:07:43.095
One brick at a time.

01:07:47.972 --> 01:07:49.303
Watch your step.
Little field trip today.

01:07:50.007 --> 01:07:51.531
Thank you.
Hi. How you doing, Brenda?

01:07:51.609 --> 01:07:53.873
Good. Trust me.

01:08:07.725 --> 01:08:09.625
All right, follow me.

01:08:13.264 --> 01:08:15.994
Wait right around
the corner, Lorraine.
Thanks.

01:08:17.568 --> 01:08:18.626
Now, watch your step.

01:08:18.702 --> 01:08:21.000
I'll see you
out there, okay?

01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:25.907
Okay.
You all right there? Okay.

01:08:25.975 --> 01:08:26.965
Thanks.

01:08:28.045 --> 01:08:29.205
I'm not going out there.

01:08:31.582 --> 01:08:33.607
I can't go out there.

01:08:36.187 --> 01:08:40.419
Walter. You're not a janitor.

01:08:41.158 --> 01:08:42.318
You're a contractor.

01:08:50.201 --> 01:08:51.634
After you.

01:09:05.483 --> 01:09:07.747
Now let's fill
this thing up.

01:09:12.022 --> 01:09:14.183
All right, gang, let’s go.

01:11:30.761 --> 01:11:32.854
He'd have gotten
a kick out of this.

01:11:39.670 --> 01:11:45.199
Thank you
for reminding me.

01:11:46.810 --> 01:11:49.108
You reminded
yourself, Walter.

01:11:52.116 --> 01:11:53.947
I couldn't hold him.

01:11:55.552 --> 01:11:57.884
At the end,
I couldn't hold him.

01:11:59.390 --> 01:12:03.292
The paramedics said
not to move him, so...

01:12:07.398 --> 01:12:09.423
I want you to have this.

01:12:15.039 --> 01:12:17.007
Beautiful boy, Walter.

01:12:22.446 --> 01:12:24.607
If you ever need
a remodel.

01:12:53.610 --> 01:12:55.510
I'll be right there.

01:12:59.416 --> 01:13:02.783
I didn't go to her funeral.
And I...

01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:07.386
Look, I haven't spoken
to her parents since I...

01:13:08.092 --> 01:13:09.457
Yeah, I didn't
take care of Rocky.

01:13:09.526 --> 01:13:10.857
I stopped talking
to her friends.

01:13:10.928 --> 01:13:14.364
I threw out everything
that even smelled of her. I...

01:13:17.167 --> 01:13:20.796
Listen, I wasn't judging you
or trying to trip you up.

01:13:23.841 --> 01:13:25.706
Can I say something?

01:13:26.610 --> 01:13:30.512
And this comes
from a place of
total humility.

01:13:31.315 --> 01:13:32.942
With the acknowledgment
that my life

01:13:33.016 --> 01:13:38.818
is a day-by-day experiment
in really bad decisions.

01:13:40.991 --> 01:13:42.185
But...

01:13:43.827 --> 01:13:45.795
You're really messed up.

01:13:47.698 --> 01:13:49.427
I mean, maybe
you need someone

01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:53.027
to nudge you
to do these things that
you don't want to do,

01:13:53.103 --> 01:13:57.972
like talk to her parents
or take care of Rocky,

01:13:58.675 --> 01:14:00.336
whatever Rocky is.

01:14:01.145 --> 01:14:02.544
What is Rocky?

01:14:02.613 --> 01:14:03.773
It's a parrot.

01:14:03.847 --> 01:14:04.905
Parrot?

01:14:04.982 --> 01:14:06.415
Her parrot.

01:14:06.884 --> 01:14:08.784
He's loud and he shits
all over the place.

01:14:10.587 --> 01:14:11.986
It's a parrot.

01:14:14.491 --> 01:14:15.480
She made me promise

01:14:15.559 --> 01:14:19.393
that if anything ever
happened to her that I'd...

01:14:21.665 --> 01:14:23.599
I mean, it sounds...
It's crazy.
What?

01:14:23.667 --> 01:14:27.364
That I would release him
into the wild.

01:14:28.605 --> 01:14:30.334
And you haven't
done that, have you?

01:14:31.141 --> 01:14:34.736
No. No,
her parents took him.

01:14:37.881 --> 01:14:39.712
Didn't you say
her parents live here?

01:14:41.452 --> 01:14:42.441
Mmm-hmm.

01:14:42.986 --> 01:14:44.578
Two birds, one stone.

01:14:44.655 --> 01:14:46.452
Come on.
Eloise, no.

01:14:46.523 --> 01:14:48.548
Why?
Because it's her...

01:14:48.892 --> 01:14:50.359
Her father...

01:14:50.427 --> 01:14:52.327
Hmm...
No, you know...

01:14:52.663 --> 01:14:54.324
It's just... It's more
complicated than that.

01:14:54.398 --> 01:14:56.696
I'm sure it's... I'm sure
it's very complicated.

01:14:56.767 --> 01:14:58.928
Eloise, no.

01:15:10.614 --> 01:15:12.138
So, that's it.

01:15:12.349 --> 01:15:13.907
That's it.

01:15:14.985 --> 01:15:15.974
Do you want me to...

01:15:16.053 --> 01:15:19.045
Do you want me
to go with you or... No.

01:15:19.223 --> 01:15:22.056
I don't think that would
go over so well.

01:15:24.661 --> 01:15:27.357
Look, you know what?
I don't even know
if they're home.

01:15:27.431 --> 01:15:29.399
They probably didn't
even keep the bird.

01:15:30.267 --> 01:15:31.495
Burke.

01:15:41.111 --> 01:15:42.840
Did I mention
that her father
is an ex-Marine?

01:15:42.913 --> 01:15:44.642
Ex-Marine. Yeah.

01:16:25.322 --> 01:16:27.722
All right, now.
So, you add in some of these
mega-mergers

01:16:27.791 --> 01:16:29.918
that we're talking about.
BHP...

01:16:51.348 --> 01:16:53.248
That's right.
Guess who.

01:16:53.317 --> 01:16:56.480
You never thought
you'd see me again,
did you?

01:17:06.597 --> 01:17:10.033
Another damn commercial.
How about some
fresh tea, hon?

01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:11.533
Oh, thanks.

01:17:20.410 --> 01:17:22.844
What the hell's
going on with you?

01:17:23.714 --> 01:17:25.511
Huh? What are you
up to now?

01:17:25.582 --> 01:17:26.708
What, honey?

01:17:26.783 --> 01:17:28.011
I'm talking to Rocky.

01:17:29.119 --> 01:17:30.143
Honey,
don't tease him.

01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:31.812
You know it gets him...
I'm not teasing him.

01:17:31.888 --> 01:17:34.550
He was doing the damn
car alarm again.

01:17:36.059 --> 01:17:37.993
Honey, could you
get me some
lemon, please?

01:17:38.061 --> 01:17:39.119
What?

01:17:39.196 --> 01:17:40.629
Could you get
some lemon, please?

01:17:40.697 --> 01:17:41.755
Yes, it's right here.

01:17:41.832 --> 01:17:43.094
Shut up!

01:17:44.034 --> 01:17:46.559
Just don't cut yourself
when you're slicing it.

01:17:46.637 --> 01:17:48.969
I won't cut myself.
Don't worry.

01:18:02.786 --> 01:18:04.617
Go! Go! Go!

01:18:05.622 --> 01:18:06.748
Start it up, go!

01:18:06.823 --> 01:18:07.915
What's going on?

01:18:07.991 --> 01:18:09.356
Go. Just drive.

01:18:09.426 --> 01:18:10.518
What?

01:18:10.594 --> 01:18:11.754
Go. Just drive.

01:18:11.828 --> 01:18:12.817
I'm going. I'm going.
Just drive!

01:18:12.896 --> 01:18:14.921
Come on, let’s get
out of here. Go, go!

01:18:14.998 --> 01:18:16.693
Go, go, go, go!

01:18:18.368 --> 01:18:20.268
Jesus, what happened?

01:18:20.337 --> 01:18:22.567
I got the bird.
That's all that matters.

01:18:22.639 --> 01:18:25.130
Oh, God. Were they...
Were they that upset?

01:18:25.208 --> 01:18:26.436
They will be.

01:18:26.510 --> 01:18:27.602
What?

01:18:31.848 --> 01:18:34.476
What happened to
"two birds, one stone"?

01:18:34.551 --> 01:18:35.916
One bird's all
I could manage.

01:18:35.986 --> 01:18:38.454
Eloise, they never would've
given me that bird.

01:18:38.522 --> 01:18:40.285
Trust me.
You don't know that.

01:18:40.357 --> 01:18:41.881
I cut my losses.

01:18:41.958 --> 01:18:43.084
If she wanted this
bird turned loose,

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:44.491
this is the way
to get it done.

01:18:47.664 --> 01:18:49.427
Okay. All right.

01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:13.783
This isn't animal cruelty
or something, is it?

01:19:16.727 --> 01:19:19.025
It wasn't my idea.
It was your idea.

01:19:19.096 --> 01:19:21.792
It wasn't my idea.
It was her idea.

01:19:23.333 --> 01:19:25.597
Well, let’s let him decide.

01:20:09.513 --> 01:20:10.707
Okay.

01:20:14.551 --> 01:20:18.885
This looks like a good place,
so I guess this is goodbye.

01:20:21.758 --> 01:20:22.952
Go on.

01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:25.853
Come on, Rocky.
Fly away.

01:20:26.630 --> 01:20:28.825
Come on, let’s go!
Giddyup!

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:33.260
You'll see the world.
Come on. Meet some girls.

01:20:38.008 --> 01:20:39.407
No, come on.

01:20:40.043 --> 01:20:41.977
Go on, get out of here.

01:20:42.746 --> 01:20:44.646
No, Rock. Come on. Go.

01:20:45.382 --> 01:20:46.713
Come here.

01:20:50.453 --> 01:20:52.683
Fly away.
Rocky, look at me.

01:20:56.626 --> 01:20:58.890
Giddyup! Giddyup!

01:21:01.164 --> 01:21:03.826
All right,
now you're pissing me off.

01:21:04.501 --> 01:21:06.162
You want to go back
to Semper Fi's house?

01:21:07.904 --> 01:21:09.667
All right, you know what?
You're on your own.

01:22:33.623 --> 01:22:35.022
How'd it go?

01:22:35.625 --> 01:22:37.388
Mission accomplished.

01:22:37.460 --> 01:22:38.984
Was he happy?

01:22:41.698 --> 01:22:43.063
Are you happy?

01:22:46.536 --> 01:22:49.096
It's a bird.
I set it free.

01:22:51.074 --> 01:22:52.063
Oh.

01:23:00.550 --> 01:23:02.450
I need you to take me
back to the hotel.

01:23:03.186 --> 01:23:04.414
Okay.

01:23:07.357 --> 01:23:09.222
I feel better
for having done it, okay?

01:23:09.292 --> 01:23:12.489
Listen, you don't have to
talk about it if you
don't want to. Really.

01:23:12.562 --> 01:23:13.756
Just tell me what to say
and I'll say it.

01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:14.854
No.

01:23:15.231 --> 01:23:16.493
I don't... I don't know.
I'm not good...

01:23:16.566 --> 01:23:18.329
I haven't thought
this through.

01:23:19.636 --> 01:23:22.730
You know, Burke,
I like you. I like you.

01:23:23.606 --> 01:23:24.937
Not the author.

01:23:25.475 --> 01:23:26.806
Not the guy
with the microphone.

01:23:26.876 --> 01:23:28.605
And I just...
I just want to help.

01:23:29.913 --> 01:23:32.438
You know what, Eloise,
I just...

01:23:33.316 --> 01:23:36.615
I need you to take me
back to the hotel, right now,

01:23:37.053 --> 01:23:38.714
and I need you
to respect that.
Burke, I will...

01:23:38.788 --> 01:23:41.916
Damn it!
You just don't know
when to quit, do you?

01:23:41.992 --> 01:23:44.859
I asked you to stop
and you just keep on.

01:23:45.762 --> 01:23:48.356
Maybe you're the one
who needs psychoanalysis.

01:23:48.431 --> 01:23:50.456
Leave me alone,
all right?

01:23:52.836 --> 01:23:55.100
I can catch
my own ride back.

01:24:41.017 --> 01:24:42.780
It's about time.

01:24:43.353 --> 01:24:45.583
Oh, my God!
Where the hell
have you been?

01:24:45.655 --> 01:24:47.316
It's not important.
Uh-huh.

01:24:47.390 --> 01:24:49.017
Well, let me
tell you something
that is important.

01:24:49.092 --> 01:24:51.117
You blew off dinner
and Vernon's here.

01:24:51.194 --> 01:24:52.388
I mean, Jesus,
you have got to...

01:24:52.462 --> 01:24:53.793
Lane!

01:24:57.801 --> 01:25:00.531
I'll meet with him
first thing in the morning,
make sure he feels the love.

01:25:00.603 --> 01:25:02.628
You, meanwhile,
accept their offer,

01:25:02.705 --> 01:25:04.263
but tell them the DVD
rollout is too late.

01:25:04.340 --> 01:25:06.035
I want it bumped up
to next month.

01:25:08.144 --> 01:25:09.441
Jesus.

01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:13.244
What the hell
happened to you, man?

01:25:13.316 --> 01:25:14.874
I can't wait to
get out of this city.

01:25:16.553 --> 01:25:17.747
Hey!

01:25:18.721 --> 01:25:19.881
Is everything cool?

01:25:19.956 --> 01:25:21.514
Absolutely.

01:25:21.591 --> 01:25:23.991
Yeah? Anything of note
happen this afternoon?

01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:25.049
Not particularly.

01:25:25.128 --> 01:25:26.322
What about Eloise?

01:25:26.629 --> 01:25:30.030
Stop! Wait! Listen to me.

01:25:31.101 --> 01:25:34.662
You know, you can
talk to me if you want to.

01:25:36.473 --> 01:25:39.704
I know. I get all mixed up.
I get caught up
in this business shit,

01:25:39.776 --> 01:25:41.641
but I want you to know

01:25:43.279 --> 01:25:45.543
that I'm there for you
if you need me to be.

01:25:48.818 --> 01:25:50.080
She's gone.

01:25:50.253 --> 01:25:51.914
She's gone?
What do you mean,
she's gone?

01:25:54.224 --> 01:25:56.624
I don't know, man, I just...

01:25:56.693 --> 01:25:58.320
I screwed it up.

01:26:00.029 --> 01:26:03.692
I threw all my...
All my bullshit in her face.

01:26:05.902 --> 01:26:07.995
It could've been something.

01:26:09.739 --> 01:26:11.604
Night, Lane.
Burke.

01:26:12.609 --> 01:26:14.338
Sleep well.
Big day tomorrow.

01:26:14.410 --> 01:26:15.434
Burke.

01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:18.611
Burke.

01:26:35.965 --> 01:26:37.125
She'd be
proud of you.

01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:38.224
I didn't go
to her funeral.

01:26:38.301 --> 01:26:39.325
Hypocrite.

01:26:39.402 --> 01:26:40.494
You're stuck.

01:26:40.570 --> 01:26:42.162
You can't move
forward because

01:26:42.238 --> 01:26:43.762
you've got your eyes
on the rearview mirror.

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:44.966
You're
really messed up.

01:26:45.041 --> 01:26:46.406
Swerved into a pole.

01:26:46.476 --> 01:26:48.205
She died instantly.

01:26:51.681 --> 01:26:54.411
When are you gonna stop
lying, son?

01:27:39.896 --> 01:27:41.989
Good morning, sire.
This way.

01:27:42.065 --> 01:27:43.089
What happened to you?

01:27:43.166 --> 01:27:45.134
Went for a little run.
It's refreshing.

01:27:45.201 --> 01:27:48.967
You know, Vernon went
for the international
and DVD rollout.

01:27:49.038 --> 01:27:52.098
Yeah. Old man
likes what he sees
and we are Rolls-Royce.

01:27:52.175 --> 01:27:53.506
Get it done.
First things first,

01:27:53.576 --> 01:27:56.272
I need you to
shake some hands
with somebody here.

01:27:57.714 --> 01:27:59.204
Mr. Vernon,
it's a pleasure...

01:28:07.991 --> 01:28:09.891
Lane goddamn Marshall.

01:28:15.865 --> 01:28:17.162
Well,

01:28:20.203 --> 01:28:22.068
this is unexpected.

01:28:27.076 --> 01:28:28.509
I'm sorry.

01:28:30.046 --> 01:28:33.675
Lane told me the truth.

01:28:38.755 --> 01:28:42.589
You don't deserve
what you put
yourself through.

01:28:45.795 --> 01:28:47.592
I hope that
you can find a way

01:28:47.664 --> 01:28:50.633
to somehow give
yourself a break

01:28:52.101 --> 01:28:55.832
because if you don't,
this is... This is
gonna be your life.

01:28:58.875 --> 01:29:00.809
I just think that's...

01:29:02.879 --> 01:29:04.676
That's just sad.

01:29:08.418 --> 01:29:10.318
That's it. That's...

01:29:11.454 --> 01:29:13.445
That's all I came to say.

01:29:21.364 --> 01:29:24.492
So, just take care
of yourself, okay?

01:29:44.487 --> 01:29:46.182
How's about it,
folks, huh?

01:29:47.423 --> 01:29:50.256
Has it been a week
of miracles or what?

01:29:54.063 --> 01:29:58.295
How many of you
can't get enough
of Burke Ryan?

01:30:00.336 --> 01:30:03.328
I bet that you
would love to see him

01:30:03.406 --> 01:30:06.637
in your living room
from 3:00 p.m.
to 4:00 p.m. every day

01:30:06.709 --> 01:30:08.472
on your local
syndicated channel.

01:30:08.544 --> 01:30:11.240
Huh? Yes!

01:30:13.383 --> 01:30:15.943
We'll see what we
can do about that.

01:30:16.018 --> 01:30:22.184
Now, without further ado,
the man of the hour,
Burke Ryan.

01:30:40.443 --> 01:30:42.911
Thank you.
Please have a seat.

01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:46.480
Thank you.
Have a seat, please.

01:30:48.718 --> 01:30:50.151
Gosh, I'm...

01:30:51.788 --> 01:30:53.619
I'm feeling okay.
How are you?

01:30:53.689 --> 01:30:55.213
A-Okay!

01:30:59.529 --> 01:31:00.860
Sir, I need to
see your badge.

01:31:00.930 --> 01:31:02.557
I'm sorry, what?
Sir, your badge.

01:31:02.632 --> 01:31:05.624
I got a badge.
He's a damn thief,
you know.

01:31:05.968 --> 01:31:07.492
Son of a bitch
broke into my house
and took something.

01:31:07.570 --> 01:31:08.935
There's your badge.
You can keep it.

01:31:09.005 --> 01:31:10.097
You keep it!

01:31:10.173 --> 01:31:13.574
We have made
a lot of progress
in the last few days,

01:31:14.811 --> 01:31:16.472
but don't forget,

01:31:17.246 --> 01:31:18.975
it's just a foundation
for the future.

01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:25.487
Excuse me.

01:31:34.096 --> 01:31:37.122
You know...
Boy, I'm sorry.

01:31:41.571 --> 01:31:43.300
I... I've...

01:31:48.744 --> 01:31:51.076
I can't lie
to you guys anymore.

01:31:56.018 --> 01:31:57.952
You know, I stand here

01:32:00.323 --> 01:32:03.315
and I watch you all
confront your pain.

01:32:07.396 --> 01:32:08.954
And I envy you

01:32:10.666 --> 01:32:12.065
because

01:32:15.404 --> 01:32:17.497
I haven't confronted mine.

01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:26.912
I didn't want it
to be my fault.

01:32:27.917 --> 01:32:29.782
My wife's accident.

01:32:32.021 --> 01:32:33.648
It was raining.

01:32:35.558 --> 01:32:37.025
This dog

01:32:42.899 --> 01:32:45.129
in the middle of the road.

01:32:47.870 --> 01:32:49.667
We had been arguing

01:32:51.774 --> 01:32:55.301
over paint colors
for the kitchen.

01:32:59.148 --> 01:33:00.638
Paint colors.

01:33:07.189 --> 01:33:09.453
But what I haven't told you

01:33:17.633 --> 01:33:20.193
is that I was
driving the car,

01:33:23.773 --> 01:33:25.001
not her.

01:33:33.149 --> 01:33:34.844
I killed my wife.

01:33:47.330 --> 01:33:49.230
I'm so sorry.

01:33:59.709 --> 01:34:01.973
It was just
an accident, son.

01:34:07.216 --> 01:34:08.877
That's all it was.

01:34:20.496 --> 01:34:22.361
There was nothing
you could have done.

01:34:22.431 --> 01:34:23.420
No.

01:34:23.499 --> 01:34:24.488
No, it's true.

01:34:24.567 --> 01:34:27.536
It was just one of those
freak accidents.

01:34:28.037 --> 01:34:30.801
Listen to me.
We never blamed you.

01:34:32.108 --> 01:34:33.439
Never.

01:34:33.809 --> 01:34:37.108
All we really wanted to do
was mourn with you, son.

01:34:37.179 --> 01:34:40.114
We didn't know what to do.
We couldn't find you.

01:34:40.182 --> 01:34:42.377
That's been the worst part.

01:34:51.494 --> 01:34:53.018
It's okay.

01:36:09.572 --> 01:36:13.133
Hey. Come here.

01:36:17.179 --> 01:36:21.445
I was thinking that maybe
I should've had you do that
a long time ago.

01:36:25.254 --> 01:36:26.516
You gonna be all right?

01:36:26.589 --> 01:36:27.988
Yeah, in time.

01:36:28.124 --> 01:36:30.888
Mr. Ryan? Ted Vernon.

01:36:31.994 --> 01:36:34.519
That was something.

01:36:36.031 --> 01:36:38.022
Yeah, that was
something, huh?

01:36:38.100 --> 01:36:41.069
That was reality
up there, Mr. Vernon.

01:36:41.137 --> 01:36:44.334
And if you can't accept
that for what it is,

01:36:44.406 --> 01:36:48.206
then you can take
your deal and you can
shove it up your ass.

01:36:52.047 --> 01:36:57.075
I found it refreshing
and I respect you for it.

01:37:01.190 --> 01:37:02.589
Thank you.

01:37:03.325 --> 01:37:04.917
I'm sorry. Are we still...

01:37:05.261 --> 01:37:06.285
We'll see.

01:37:07.630 --> 01:37:09.029
This is why
you keep firing me.

01:37:09.098 --> 01:37:10.998
I'll be right back.
Mr. Vernon?

01:37:26.949 --> 01:37:30.146
There's something
I don't think
you ever realized.

01:37:30.519 --> 01:37:32.419
As far as
we were concerned,

01:37:32.488 --> 01:37:34.388
we didn't just
lose our daughter.

01:37:35.057 --> 01:37:36.854
We also lost our son.

01:37:39.195 --> 01:37:40.184
I'm sorry.

01:37:40.462 --> 01:37:41.451
We understand.

01:37:43.265 --> 01:37:46.723
And she would want you
to just get on
with your life.

01:37:47.903 --> 01:37:49.700
And don't be a stranger.

01:37:49.772 --> 01:37:52.639
But next time
make sure you use
the front door.

01:37:52.708 --> 01:37:54.505
I will. I promise.

01:37:55.244 --> 01:37:58.975
And listen.
Thank you, son.
Thank you.

01:37:59.748 --> 01:38:01.238
Look, I should have done this
a long time ago.

01:38:01.317 --> 01:38:03.751
No, no, no,
not about that.

01:38:03.819 --> 01:38:05.912
For getting rid
of that damn bird.

01:38:07.656 --> 01:38:08.645
I love you, kid.

01:38:08.724 --> 01:38:09.952
I love you, too.

01:41:00.896 --> 01:41:03.364
Hey, I got your bear grass.

01:41:03.432 --> 01:41:05.593
Oh, great. Thank you. Hi.

01:41:24.620 --> 01:41:25.780
Hi.

01:41:27.322 --> 01:41:28.346
Hi.

01:41:29.858 --> 01:41:31.621
Well, the thing is

01:41:34.496 --> 01:41:36.896
you've spent
the last few days

01:41:36.965 --> 01:41:39.433
getting to know
the part of me that...

01:41:41.236 --> 01:41:43.568
That wasn't
really available.

01:41:44.006 --> 01:41:48.909
So, I was wondering,
if I haven't screwed it up
too bad,

01:41:51.046 --> 01:41:56.348
if you would be interested
in getting to know
the part of me that is.

01:41:58.420 --> 01:41:59.546
Yes, she would.

01:42:00.122 --> 01:42:01.214
Marty!

01:42:01.390 --> 01:42:02.687
Sorry.

01:42:29.218 --> 01:42:30.378
Yes.

01:42:48.203 --> 01:42:50.194
Chapter 15.

01:42:50.272 --> 01:42:51.637
During your travels,

01:42:51.707 --> 01:42:54.904
it's important
to always keep
one thing in mind.

01:42:54.977 --> 01:42:58.242
When one thing ends,
something else begins.

01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:19.162
Jeez.

01:43:21.670 --> 01:43:23.262
Is it yourself?

01:43:24.773 --> 01:43:26.798
Yes, who else would it be?

01:43:28.877 --> 01:43:31.641
Come on, climb on. Come on.

01:43:33.682 --> 01:43:35.309
Hello.
Hello.

01:43:36.418 --> 01:43:39.080
I won't ask you
where you've been,
not that I care.

01:43:39.154 --> 01:43:40.917
Hello.
Hello.

01:43:40.989 --> 01:43:43.253
Back to the salt mines, kid.

01:43:43.325 --> 01:43:44.917
Hello.
Hello.

01:43:47.396 --> 01:43:48.988
Hello.
Hello.

01:43:49.631 --> 01:43:50.996
Goodbye.
