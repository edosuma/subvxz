00:10.385 --> 00:14.889
Oh, you seem to be sincere and good.

00:15.306 --> 00:21.104
How strange it is that we meet
and now we must part.

00:21.187 --> 00:23.148
That is the way of the world.

00:23.773 --> 00:26.359
May I kiss you, my fair lady?

00:33.408 --> 00:36.828
[exhales] All right, that's it for today.

00:36.911 --> 00:38.705
Good work, everyone.

00:38.788 --> 00:41.041
Let's try and be off book by tomorrow.

00:41.124 --> 00:42.292
[girl] Yeah!

00:43.501 --> 00:44.461
[Oliver whistles]

00:44.544 --> 00:45.879
Oliver, wait.

00:47.589 --> 00:48.673
Wow.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.675
That was some kiss, huh?

00:52.886 --> 00:54.804
I don't know what she sees in him.

00:56.181 --> 00:57.515
Maybe his mouth tastes good.

00:58.099 --> 01:01.728
[scoffs] Yeah, right.
Like raspberry Warheads and cigarettes.

01:01.811 --> 01:03.813
[chuckles] Yeah.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.781
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

01:16.367 --> 01:19.037
Um... okay.

01:19.621 --> 01:21.456
Hey, wait.

01:23.083 --> 01:26.503
I realize that all of this
may feel really sudden,

01:26.586 --> 01:31.299
but I just want to let you know I'm happy
you said "yes" to going out with me.

01:31.674 --> 01:32.926
I like you...

01:34.093 --> 01:35.678
a lot. [chuckles]

01:36.221 --> 01:37.388
Thanks.

01:38.181 --> 01:39.557
I like you, too.

01:39.641 --> 01:42.727
[sighs] I figure now that
we're going out and stuff,

01:43.478 --> 01:44.687
maybe we could...

01:46.022 --> 01:47.941
Could what?

01:48.817 --> 01:51.653
[exhales] I don't know... kiss?

01:53.154 --> 01:55.698
Just to get it out of the way.

01:56.825 --> 01:58.076
No big deal.

01:58.576 --> 02:00.495
Um, yeah.

02:00.578 --> 02:03.164
Cool. Okay.

02:03.706 --> 02:05.834
[exhales] I'm really nervous. [chuckles]

-Why did you do that?
-I don't know.

02:22.058 --> 02:23.017
What do we do?

02:23.101 --> 02:26.271
Um, okay, you take the front,
and I'll take the back.

02:26.354 --> 02:27.814

what your son confessed to is serious.

09:34.323 --> 09:36.158
In some situations,

09:36.242 --> 09:39.287

might be considered a felony.

09:40.288 --> 09:41.372
I'm sorry, a what?

09:41.455 --> 09:44.709
Yeah, but that's why I wanted
to have this chat.

09:44.792 --> 09:47.878
To get a sense of
whether this behavior is normal, or--

09:47.962 --> 09:51.465
Look, I-I don't know what to say,

09:51.549 --> 09:54.468
except that this doesn't sound like Luke.

09:54.552 --> 09:57.847
Notice any changes recently?
Anything different?

09:57.930 --> 10:00.391
No. Nothing that makes sense
of any of this.

10:01.642 --> 10:03.603
Mr. Messner, I'm raising Luke on my own

10:03.686 --> 10:07.023
and with my work,
I'm not around as much as I'd like to be,

10:07.106 --> 10:11.110
but from where I sit,
Luke is a happy, well-adjusted young man.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.823
Or maybe I'm missing something.

10:15.906 --> 10:18.951
I, uh... I didn't realize.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.536
You're a single mother.

10:21.787 --> 10:23.331
Single father.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.584

Ya think?

10:28.461 --> 10:29.337

by a thread already, it won't take much.

No one's pressing charges.

You know, it's just my job
to tell you these things.

11:09.335 --> 11:10.169
[sighs]

11:10.252 --> 11:12.463
Also, truth be told,

11:12.546 --> 11:17.635
uh, my intentions today
were somewhat twofold.

11:19.261 --> 11:23.516
Well, since Luke and my daughter Kate

11:23.599 --> 11:26.394
are kinda going out.

11:26.477 --> 11:29.772
I wanted to meet you.
Hope you don't mind. I'm just being a dad.

11:29.855 --> 11:32.024
Wait, really? Luke and your daughter?

11:33.943 --> 11:35.403
Wow. [chuckles]

11:35.903 --> 11:38.155
Well, that's news to me. I...

11:38.239 --> 11:40.616
I mean, I knew he liked a girl, but...

11:41.242 --> 11:43.953
I must seem like the worst parent
on Earth right now.

11:44.036 --> 11:46.122
What? Uh, no.

11:46.205 --> 11:48.707
Please, don't think that.

11:49.166 --> 11:50.960
Trust me. I meet a lot of parents.

11:51.627 --> 11:55.339
After a while, you sort of develop
a sixth sense for these things.

11:56.340 --> 11:58.384
You strike me as a great parent.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.010
Really.

12:00.761 --> 12:02.096
I could tell.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.267
Oh, oh, no.

12:07.435 --> 12:08.686
[sniffles]

12:08.769 --> 12:09.645

12:12.064 --> 12:13.065

Mm... [laughs]

12:24.118 --> 12:26.787
Boy, I don't know what's wrong with me.

12:28.789 --> 12:31.792
Do you wish there were
support groups for single parents?

12:33.043 --> 12:34.253
I sure do.

12:38.716 --> 12:42.970
-I have this meeting, but if you'd like...
-Oh.

12:43.053 --> 12:45.848
...maybe we could have coffee,
uh, tomorrow morning.

12:45.931 --> 12:48.142
We could continue this conversation?

12:49.101 --> 12:53.063
Maybe we could start
a support group of our own.

12:54.732 --> 12:57.735
-Dumb idea. Shouldn't have said anything.
-No, no.

12:58.319 --> 13:00.279
[laughs] I like that idea.

13:00.696 --> 13:03.532
It's just,
I'm on a transatlantic flight tomorrow.
