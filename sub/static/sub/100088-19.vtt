09:44.125 --> 09:45.334
then helo out there?

09:45.418 --> 09:47.503
Look, we're not the only ones
that think Sidiqi is the link

09:47.586 --> 09:49.213
to the Tahara network.

09:49.297 --> 09:50.423
The Afghans want
a crack at him, too,

09:50.506 --> 09:53.134
but the State Department got us
to the front of the line.

09:53.217 --> 09:54.468
JASON:
Guy like this,

09:54.552 --> 09:55.720
someone this high up
on the totem pole,

09:55.803 --> 09:57.680
I'm telling you right now,
his new team

09:57.763 --> 10:00.141
must be missing him by now.

09:57.763 --> 10:00.141
ERIC: Exactly.

10:00.224 --> 10:03.019
We can't risk anyone else
getting to him before we do.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.521
That's why you're rolling out
in one hour.

10:05.604 --> 10:08.232
Sidiqi could be the key
that unlocks the Tahara network.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.401
Let's bring him in.

10:18.159 --> 10:20.786
(speaking indistinctly)

10:20.870 --> 10:21.746
I'll see you later.

10:21.829 --> 10:23.581
Okay, bye.

10:25.249 --> 10:27.251
You know, Sonny's back soon.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.337
Yes, I'm aware of that.

10:29.420 --> 10:32.173
I haven't, I haven't talked
to him since he deployed. You?

10:32.256 --> 10:36.260
No. Uh, but I really
didn't expect to

10:36.344 --> 10:38.220
after his whole
scorched earth campaign

10:38.304 --> 10:39.555
he went on before he left.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.891
Oh, wow.

10:41.974 --> 10:44.268
I mean, you... you think
he was hot then.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.437
How you think he's gonna
react to you and Reiss?

10:47.813 --> 10:51.400
About as well as him reacting
to you going to STA-21.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.526
I'm sure he'll take it
the same way

10:52.610 --> 10:53.903
the rest of my teammates did.

10:53.986 --> 10:55.404
You know, I'm a
cake-eating wannabe

10:55.488 --> 10:57.531
Benedict Arnold who's
abandoned the brotherhood.

10:57.615 --> 11:00.076
Just got to be true
to your own path.

11:00.159 --> 11:03.204
Be as clear
and as honest as possible.

11:03.287 --> 11:05.956
That's what I would do
if I had a thing.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.417
I'd say you've got
more than a thing.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.669
Then I'd say
you know more than me.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.173
Hey.

11:15.299 --> 11:16.967
Watch Reiss's six.

11:17.051 --> 11:19.261
He's not a door-kicker like you.

11:20.304 --> 11:22.264
I got you.

11:25.309 --> 11:26.644
EMMET: It's hard
to believe that you'll be

11:26.727 --> 11:28.729
off to Afghanistan
in a week.

11:28.813 --> 11:30.731
SONNY: Yeah, it's part
of the life, though.

11:30.815 --> 11:32.274
Got to be up and ready.

11:32.358 --> 11:34.443
Pick up and head out
without warning.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.488
Ah, then, you did learn
something from your old man.

11:37.571 --> 11:39.240
(both chuckle)

11:39.323 --> 11:41.992
All these years, I hated
never having any idea

11:42.076 --> 11:43.994
where you were
being deployed.

11:44.078 --> 11:46.288
Now... (sighs)

11:46.372 --> 11:47.957
it's scarier knowing.

11:48.040 --> 11:51.335
Makes it...
too real.

11:51.419 --> 11:52.795
Hey.

11:52.878 --> 11:55.339
You just try
to keep your powder dry.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.513
I spoke to Stan Walch
the other day.

12:02.596 --> 12:05.516
Said you could get one hell
of a price for 50 acres.

12:05.599 --> 12:07.476
When it comes to
real estate people,

12:07.560 --> 12:11.814
they remind me of, like,
ambulance chasers with a sign.

12:13.399 --> 12:16.610
Yeah? Well, he was, uh,

12:16.694 --> 12:18.320
saying a lot
of out-of-staters--

12:18.404 --> 12:20.072
they're moving
to Texas these days.

12:21.198 --> 12:24.452
I got no interest sharing
my ranch with city slickers.

12:24.535 --> 12:28.164
Well, what if I was
your new neighbor?

12:28.247 --> 12:30.166
How's that?

12:30.249 --> 12:32.168
Well, the program
I was in at the base--

12:32.251 --> 12:34.670
a new instructor
position opened up,

12:34.753 --> 12:37.047
and I figure I could

12:37.131 --> 12:40.342
make my way back here
and finish out my enlistment.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.011
Coming back here?

12:42.094 --> 12:43.512
Yeah.

12:43.596 --> 12:46.515
Son, you sound like
you got bucked in the head.

12:46.599 --> 12:50.352
You know, I've been out at sea
since I was 18 years old, Pops.

12:50.436 --> 12:53.355
And this shore duty billet--

12:53.439 --> 12:55.858
that would allow me
to have more time

12:55.941 --> 12:57.526
to come here and, well,

12:57.610 --> 13:00.654
help you get this ranch back up
to, to Quinn standards.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.533
It's a big change.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.368
How about your team?

13:06.452 --> 13:08.412
Well, the team's
evolved.

13:08.496 --> 13:11.081
And I'm thinking
maybe I should, too.

13:11.165 --> 13:13.417
You know?

13:13.501 --> 13:16.337
I ran away
from this place once before.

13:16.420 --> 13:19.340
Just think, you know,
maybe it's time I...

13:19.423 --> 13:21.383
I put some roots down here.

13:35.064 --> 13:37.107
♪ ♪

13:46.492 --> 13:47.785
Um, can I take your order?

13:47.868 --> 13:49.578
Lamb kebab, please.

13:47.868 --> 13:49.578
Ah.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.747
Is Samim here?

13:51.830 --> 13:53.916
Uh, no, ma'am.

13:53.999 --> 13:56.043
It seems like
he's always here.

13:56.126 --> 13:58.295
Do you know if he's
coming in later?

13:58.379 --> 13:59.588
I have not spoken to him.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.424
Okay, thanks.

14:03.342 --> 14:05.844
It's coming, I promise,
I promise, one moment.

14:10.683 --> 14:11.934
Hey, Ray.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.519
Anything we need to talk about?

14:13.602 --> 14:15.980
No. Nothing.
I'm good.

14:16.063 --> 14:18.566
Right, you were just,

14:18.649 --> 14:20.109
what, talking
to the chaplain,

14:20.192 --> 14:22.403
telling him
everything's okay? Come on.

14:22.486 --> 14:23.737
Nothing like kids

14:23.821 --> 14:25.948
to make a man question
the meaning of life, right?

14:26.031 --> 14:27.324
You want meaning?

14:27.408 --> 14:28.784
What we do here--
that's what matters.

14:28.867 --> 14:30.327
I'm not saying it doesn't, J.

14:30.411 --> 14:31.287
I'm just saying,
it's getting harder and harder

14:31.370 --> 14:33.247
not to have my head
back home with my family.

14:33.330 --> 14:34.456
Right, I get that,
but you know what?

14:34.540 --> 14:36.333
This job matters.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.627
Where you hang your
helmet-- that's home.

14:39.670 --> 14:41.922
Yeah.

14:43.674 --> 14:44.925
One more.

14:43.674 --> 14:44.925
(lock beeps, door opens)

14:45.009 --> 14:47.011
(indistinct chatter)

14:49.597 --> 14:51.515
We have a situation.

14:51.599 --> 14:52.808
Samim is MIA.

14:52.891 --> 14:54.602
I think
Reiss burned him.

14:54.685 --> 14:56.478
Um, yeah, Reiss
told me about that.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.606
I... think
you might be overreacting.

14:58.689 --> 15:00.649
Well, he's not
answering his phone,

15:00.733 --> 15:02.192
he didn't show up
for work today,

15:02.276 --> 15:03.652
and his employees
haven't heard from him.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.154
Look, I think
after Caracas,

15:05.237 --> 15:06.655
you're probably
assuming the worst.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.198
This isn't
about Dr. Craig.

15:08.282 --> 15:11.201
I need to know if Samim is
down hard or just lying low.

15:11.285 --> 15:13.621
Look, we leveraged him
into working for us.

15:13.704 --> 15:15.497
Maybe serving Americans
isn't something

15:15.581 --> 15:17.333
he's all that excited
to do anymore.

15:17.416 --> 15:20.336
I developed sources
because you asked me to.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.838
You wanted me to pressure
Samim, so I did.

15:22.921 --> 15:25.716
I'm only asking for a little
help to know if he's okay.

15:25.799 --> 15:28.677
You're aware of how low on
assets we are with the drawdown.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.847
And you're aware that
Samim is a valuable source.

15:31.930 --> 15:33.682
Check his status.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.644
I will ask the Army S3 shop

15:36.727 --> 15:38.520
to get a patrol
to stop by his house.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.898
I'll tell 'em that he's wanted
for more questioning.

15:40.981 --> 15:42.149
Thank you.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.661
Havoc, this is 1.
We're passing Fairlane.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.666
Is there a holiday
we didn't know about?

16:00.000 --> 16:02.294
<i>High noon,</i>
<i>the shops are all closed.</i>

16:06.090 --> 16:08.384
Yup, this is weird.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.469
Heads on a swivel, boys.
Heads on a swivel.

16:16.975 --> 16:19.645
(shouting in distance)

16:29.697 --> 16:31.824
(engine starts)

16:56.682 --> 16:58.350
Tell him to hurry up, will you?

16:58.434 --> 17:00.477
Let's go.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.477

17:00.561 --> 17:02.688
Tabsheer Sidiqi.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.196
(speaking Pashto)

17:17.536 --> 17:19.663
Sir, I've got four vehicles
approaching the village.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.665
How many pax?

17:19.747 --> 17:21.665
I can't tell.

17:21.749 --> 17:23.459
It looks like trucks,
but I can't make out

17:23.542 --> 17:24.752
how many passengers
there are.

17:24.835 --> 17:26.837
All right,
get Bravo up on comms.

17:28.380 --> 17:29.965
Bravo 1, this
is Havoc Base.

17:30.048 --> 17:31.467
Be advised,
you've got a convoy

17:31.550 --> 17:32.801
of four vehicles
approaching

17:32.885 --> 17:34.011
from the south side of town,

17:34.094 --> 17:35.804
approximately ten klicks out.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.765
That's good copy.
Stand by to stand by.

17:37.848 --> 17:38.807
Sidiqi's friends inbound?

17:38.891 --> 17:40.768
Somebody should tell them
visiting hours are over.

17:40.851 --> 17:42.811
There's got to be, what,
two cells back there?

17:42.895 --> 17:44.688
Why is it taking so long?
Why is it taking so long?

17:44.772 --> 17:47.357
Sir, I've got
two more vehicles approaching.

17:47.441 --> 17:49.151
All right, call it in

17:49.234 --> 17:50.652
and have 'em spin up the QRF.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.988
I want 'em standing by
to launch.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.988
Bravo 1,

17:53.071 --> 17:55.282
this is Havoc Base. You've got
two additional unknown vehicles

17:55.365 --> 17:56.700
approaching your position

17:56.784 --> 17:57.993
from the south,
approximately

17:58.076 --> 17:59.828
seven klicks
outside the village.

17:59.912 --> 18:00.829
That's good copy.
We're not waiting around

18:00.913 --> 18:01.705
for them. You two got that.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.499
Thirty, you're with
me. Give me that.

18:03.582 --> 18:05.334
Hey.

18:05.417 --> 18:06.835
Listen, Captain.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.504
We need this. Sidiqi.

18:08.587 --> 18:09.797
Now. We need...

18:09.880 --> 18:11.173
(bangs table)

18:09.880 --> 18:11.173
...him now.

18:11.256 --> 18:12.674
That him?

18:11.256 --> 18:12.674
REISS:
That's a dead ringer.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.885
JASON:
Great. That's him.
Take a picture,

18:14.968 --> 18:16.678
show the captain
so we can go.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.847
Let's go, Reiss.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.847
I got to upload it
to Havoc, all right?

18:18.931 --> 18:20.808
JASON: Send it.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.808
Hold on. I have to get

18:20.891 --> 18:21.934
his fingerprints.

18:20.891 --> 18:21.934
Reiss, hurry up.

18:22.017 --> 18:25.354
I am just following protocol.

18:22.017 --> 18:25.354
Reiss, hurry up. Reiss!

18:27.231 --> 18:29.775
(vehicle approaches)

18:32.152 --> 18:34.738
Bravo 1, we got
a blue station wagon

18:34.822 --> 18:37.449
parked and idling
about a block away.

Great. We need him.
We're taking him.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.253

18:47.000 --> 18:49.253
Tell him in Pashto.

18:49.336 --> 18:50.754
Tell him we need
to take him now.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.714
Tabsheer Sidiqi...

18:50.838 --> 18:52.714
Tell him

18:52.798 --> 18:54.216
we need to take him now.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.216
Tabsheer Sidiqi...

18:54.299 --> 18:56.218
Tell him we need
to take him now!

18:54.299 --> 18:56.218
No!

18:56.301 --> 18:57.302
Havoc, this is 1.

was the target, not us!

20:23.221 --> 20:25.599
Probably took it out
to isolate Sidiqi!

somehow.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.508

20:59.591 --> 21:01.677
All right. Get me another bird
up overhead ASAP.

Structure secure.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.726
Set security, will you?

21:50.809 --> 21:51.893
There must've been
some sort of SAM

21:51.977 --> 21:52.894
out there that took out
that Predator.

21:52.978 --> 21:53.895
Yeah, thank you,
Charlie Wilson.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.063
Tell you what.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.065
Word must have gotten
out that they were gonna hit us.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.191
That's why everything

21:58.275 --> 21:59.860
was so quiet, Ray.

21:58.275 --> 21:59.860
CLAY:
Yeah, well,

21:59.943 --> 22:02.070
those vehicles Davis saw are
gonna be in the village by now.

22:02.154 --> 22:04.906
I guess Sidiqi was more valuable
than what we thought.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.408
Do we still have comms?

22:06.491 --> 22:09.119
No. Comms went down
when the Predator got hit,

22:09.202 --> 22:10.746
and the manpack was in the back
of the truck.

22:10.829 --> 22:12.956
We're on intrasquad until
the next drone is overhead

And when

22:14.708 --> 22:16.251

22:14.708 --> 22:16.251

What do we do?
We just hunker down till then?

22:20.505 --> 22:21.757
Negative.
That's not gonna happen.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.258
This ambush was
well planned.

22:23.341 --> 22:24.885
I want us out of
their playbook.

We got, we got four vehicles
to the south, two to the north.

So we head north and
punch through 'em.
That's what we're gonna do.

22:29.723 --> 22:31.767
As long as we have Sidiqi,
we got an "X" on our back.

22:31.850 --> 22:34.853
Reiss, talk to him.
He's gonna guide us out of here.

22:34.936 --> 22:35.896
Let's go.

I get him talking.

34:28.775 --> 34:30.943
Hey, listen.
I hate to be that guy,

34:31.027 --> 34:33.446
but that's my collar, so
it should be my interrogation.

34:33.529 --> 34:34.655
I got this.

34:34.739 --> 34:35.823
Yep.

34:39.577 --> 34:41.162
I'm just glad you're okay.

34:41.245 --> 34:42.538
Well, the only reason I am

34:42.622 --> 34:44.499
is 'cause I was rolling
with your boys.

34:44.582 --> 34:46.501
Nobody better to pull you
out a ditch, that's for sure.

34:46.584 --> 34:48.669
Trust me.

34:57.428 --> 34:59.764
Ah. Hey there, Mama.

35:03.100 --> 35:05.770
I brought you
your favorite flowers.

35:16.823 --> 35:20.576
She would've been real proud
how her Sunshine turned out.

35:20.660 --> 35:23.579
You think so?

35:26.582 --> 35:27.250
Oh, yeah.

35:27.333 --> 35:29.877
You have her spirit
of adventure.

35:29.961 --> 35:32.421
Yeah, she wanted me
to-to see the world.

35:32.505 --> 35:33.673
I never got around to it.

35:33.756 --> 35:36.217
But you did.

35:36.300 --> 35:39.720
Yeah, well, I reckon it's time
I see a lot more of this place.

35:39.804 --> 35:42.431
A hell of a lot more.

35:42.515 --> 35:44.892
Honestly, I hope you don't.

35:46.686 --> 35:48.563
And why's that?

35:48.646 --> 35:51.649
Well, I don't know,
you coming back here

35:51.732 --> 35:54.443
and seeing the ranch...

35:54.527 --> 35:57.738
playing house with Hannah.

35:57.822 --> 35:59.490
Nice walk down memory lane.

35:59.574 --> 36:02.702
That's about it.

36:02.785 --> 36:04.036
Well, how you figure?

36:04.120 --> 36:05.580
It's not who you are.

36:05.663 --> 36:07.123
If it was,

36:07.206 --> 36:10.084
you never would've left here
in the first place.

36:10.167 --> 36:12.879
I was just a confused kid
when I ran away

36:12.962 --> 36:15.256
and left you high and dry.

36:15.339 --> 36:16.924
You didn't run away.

36:17.008 --> 36:22.096
I couldn't hack
your mom passing.

36:22.179 --> 36:25.182
And I pushed you away.

36:27.518 --> 36:29.896
That doesn't mean
I can't come home now.

36:29.979 --> 36:33.900
Uh... you were right
about Stan Walch.

36:33.983 --> 36:35.109
I talked to him.

36:35.192 --> 36:38.279
And there is a buyer
who's raring to go.

36:38.362 --> 36:40.281
So I'm gonna sell
half the ranch.

36:40.364 --> 36:41.407
Wha-Wha-What do you mean?

36:41.490 --> 36:44.952
I thought the whole point
was for, for me to buy it.

36:45.036 --> 36:48.831
For a decade, I was praying
for you to come home.

36:51.292 --> 36:54.462
But now I know who you are,

36:54.545 --> 36:56.756
and I can't let you
stay here.

36:56.839 --> 36:59.300
But I could help you
fix up the ranch.

36:59.383 --> 37:00.593
Okay?

37:00.676 --> 37:01.969
Get it back on its feet.
I mean, thi-thi-thi--

37:02.053 --> 37:04.513
this is your legacy, Pops.

37:04.597 --> 37:07.850
My legacy's not
a pile of dirt.

37:09.894 --> 37:12.688
My legacy's standing in
front of me right now.

37:12.772 --> 37:15.149
My son.

37:15.232 --> 37:17.151
A damn Navy SEAL.

37:17.234 --> 37:19.779
You had a calling
beyond this place.

37:19.862 --> 37:21.489
And those brothers,
they helped build

37:21.572 --> 37:23.699
the man that you are now.

37:23.783 --> 37:25.993
They deserve you more than me.

37:26.077 --> 37:29.789
Now, you left a family once.

37:29.872 --> 37:32.959
Don't make that mistake again.

37:49.934 --> 37:52.186
(lock beeps)

37:54.271 --> 37:56.273
I got a name.

37:56.357 --> 37:58.484
You're not gonna believe
who it is, either.

38:00.319 --> 38:01.862
What's wrong?

38:01.946 --> 38:05.074
The Army patrol we tasked
got back ten minutes ago.

38:05.157 --> 38:07.994
Samim?

38:08.077 --> 38:09.412
They found him
in the market.

38:09.495 --> 38:11.205
I'm sorry.

38:23.300 --> 38:26.053
How did he die?
I need to know everything.

38:26.137 --> 38:27.179
It won't help you.

38:27.263 --> 38:28.973
Everything.

38:30.474 --> 38:32.518
Nice to see you finally
getting some trigger time.

38:32.601 --> 38:34.895
It's not my fault Boomer 1
put me on babysitting duty.

38:34.979 --> 38:38.441
(imitating machine gun)

38:38.524 --> 38:39.567
(laughter)

38:39.650 --> 38:41.902
I can't wait to read how
it really happened, Thirty.

38:41.986 --> 38:44.196
That was a good job
today out there. Seriously.

38:44.280 --> 38:45.948
The way you found that thermal
in that hide.

38:46.032 --> 38:48.200
Thinking like a shooter.

38:48.284 --> 38:50.036
Ah, it wasn't all me.

38:48.284 --> 38:50.036
Huh?

38:50.119 --> 38:52.204
Ray made the shots
that counted.

38:52.288 --> 38:54.373
Yeah, well, I'll tell you what.
You're gonna miss it here

38:54.457 --> 38:56.917
when you're flying behind
that good old desk

38:57.001 --> 39:00.046
with that number-two pencil
in your hand.

38:57.001 --> 39:00.046
(Ray laughs)

39:00.129 --> 39:01.756
You good?

39:00.129 --> 39:01.756
Yeah, man.

39:01.839 --> 39:02.840
Fragged shoulder and all.

39:02.923 --> 39:04.884
Come on, you're better
than good. You kidding me?

39:04.967 --> 39:06.385
The way you hung it
out there today.

39:06.469 --> 39:09.221
Ah, I'm glad I did.
It felt right, man.

39:09.305 --> 39:11.098
I haven't seen so clearly
since we got here.

39:11.182 --> 39:14.060
Knowing I was protecting
my brothers, I realized,

39:14.143 --> 39:15.728
at least for today,

39:15.811 --> 39:17.480
I don't need any other reason
to be here than that.

39:17.563 --> 39:20.441
Protect the pack.

39:20.524 --> 39:22.109
That's why we fight.

39:22.193 --> 39:23.277
Right?

39:23.360 --> 39:24.695
Too bad fighting's
the easy part.

39:24.779 --> 39:26.155

39:26.238 --> 39:28.115
CLAY:
Hey, you, uh,

39:28.199 --> 39:29.283
think you're gonna
tell Jameelah

39:29.366 --> 39:30.785
about that little love tap?

39:33.829 --> 39:36.791
I'm gonna get another beer.

39:36.874 --> 39:38.626
ERIC:
All right, listen up.

39:38.709 --> 39:39.960
You'll all be happy
to know that all your

39:40.044 --> 39:43.297
bullet dodging today
wasn't for nothing.

39:43.380 --> 39:45.091

He wouldn't happen to be
related to Asim Al-Hazred?

39:54.266 --> 39:56.519
Yes. Azfaar is his only son.

39:56.602 --> 40:00.481
War on Terror's OG HVT,
until Bravo Team took him out.

40:00.564 --> 40:02.316
Biggest op of my career.

40:02.399 --> 40:04.652
Biggest op of any career,
brother.

40:04.735 --> 40:07.029
The shot that made
Captain America famous.

40:07.113 --> 40:09.156
TRENT:
This Al-Hazred kid is
dirtbag royalty.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.324
Whoever schwacks this guy
is gonna be on

40:10.407 --> 40:12.118

40:12.201 --> 40:14.453
Doesn't matter
whose dad it was.

40:14.537 --> 40:16.664
It's just another
name on the list.

40:16.747 --> 40:18.541
Just another target.

40:18.624 --> 40:20.292
That's all.
