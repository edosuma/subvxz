MRS. CROOK: Yes, ma'am?

01:37.600 --> 01:38.965
You need to start milking
the goat straight away.

01:39.040 --> 01:40.007
Yes, ma'am.

01:40.120 --> 01:41.849
And then
ask Granny MacNab for some honey.

01:41.920 --> 01:43.126
- She'll ken what it's for.
- MRS. CROOK: Yes, ma'am.

01:50.760 --> 01:51.761
What's your plan, then?

01:52.600 --> 01:54.011
Claire? Claire!

01:54.600 --> 01:55.761
What do you intend to do?

01:55.840 --> 01:57.842
I intend to get my husband back.

01:57.920 --> 02:00.127
Well, you cannot go alone.

(GROANS)

02:01.200 --> 02:03.851
Allow me a moment to gather my
strength and I'll accompany you.

02:04.280 --> 02:06.487
You can't go anywhere in your condition.

02:08.199 --> 02:09.201
You're missing your leg.

02:09.280 --> 02:10.281
(BABY CRYING)

02:11.640 --> 02:12.766
I'll fashion another one.

02:12.960 --> 02:14.769
You're not going anywhere
with a wounded arm.

02:16.040 --> 02:17.485
You're taking some of
the lads with you, then.

02:17.560 --> 02:18.561
Mrs. Crook?

02:19.120 --> 02:22.203
Fetch Duncan
and have him gather the tenants.

02:22.280 --> 02:23.441
The ones with proper weapons.

02:23.520 --> 02:25.170
- Right away.
- No.

02:25.800 --> 02:28.041
Nobody is going anywhere. Nobody but me.

02:28.120 --> 02:29.451
We have to do something.

02:29.520 --> 02:31.329
Our Laird is in the clutches of the English.

02:31.400 --> 02:34.165
If you engage
with the British army to rescue Jamie,

02:34.520 --> 02:36.921
then Lallybroch could face
retribution from the Crown.

02:37.320 --> 02:39.687
And your Laird
would not want that to happen.

02:39.920 --> 02:41.206
Especially on his account.

02:41.680 --> 02:44.047
Well, at least let me make myself useful.

02:45.240 --> 02:46.446
Give you a place to start.

02:46.640 --> 02:48.483
Fetch me a paper and ink.

02:48.920 --> 02:50.763
I'll try my hand at a rough map

02:50.840 --> 02:51.887
of where we were set upon.

03:00.760 --> 03:01.921
CLAIRE: Please, hurry.

03:11.360 --> 03:12.600
Where on earth do you think you're going?

03:13.240 --> 03:15.004
You just gave birth. You can't leave.

03:15.080 --> 03:16.366
You may be armed with a map

03:16.440 --> 03:17.805
and a fair knowledge of the area.

03:17.880 --> 03:19.609
But that's worthless for tracking soldiers.

03:21.040 --> 03:22.041
CLAIRE: <i>She was right.</i>

03:22.320 --> 03:24.368

around Lallybroch.</i>

03:25.240 --> 03:27.891

a time off the land, but for how long?</i>

03:29.040 --> 03:31.168
<i>I knew full well
if I had any hope of finding Jamie</i>

03:31.240 --> 03:32.366

03:33.240 --> 03:34.651

God, our father.

I found more tracks. East.

05:33.120 --> 05:34.963
Just as Ian said. They have a cart.
It's heavy.

05:35.040 --> 05:36.371
It should be easy enough to follow.

05:39.240 --> 05:40.480
Hopefully, 'cause there's a rather large

05:40.560 --> 05:42.210
redheaded Scot weighing it down.

06:15.120 --> 06:16.121
I'm bursting.

06:49.640 --> 06:52.246
Aye, the bairn's sucking starts the milk.

06:52.400 --> 06:53.925
Then all the child need do is swallow.

06:55.360 --> 06:57.362
Ah! Feels much better.

06:58.040 --> 06:59.405
I cannot leave wee Maggie too long.

07:01.280 --> 07:02.281
It's a nuisance.

07:02.400 --> 07:04.767
Everything to do with bairns
is a nuisance, almost.

07:05.520 --> 07:06.521
But Still,

07:07.320 --> 07:08.606
I'd never choose not to have them.

07:11.920 --> 07:13.160
No, you wouldn't choose that.

07:20.800 --> 07:21.801
Do you think We'll find him?

07:22.160 --> 07:23.161
We have to.

07:23.640 --> 07:25.563
They're still a few hours
ahead of us at the least.

07:26.200 --> 07:27.850
They get to Fort William before we do,

07:27.920 --> 07:30.400
I'm afraid Jack Randall
might finally finish what he started.

07:31.440 --> 07:33.044
I've been thinking about that.

07:33.640 --> 07:34.926
I plan on avoiding him altogether

07:35.000 --> 07:36.286
by bargaining with Lord Thomas.

07:37.360 --> 07:39.886
He's the commander
of the British Army in this area

07:40.480 --> 07:41.925
and Randall's superior.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.001
With any luck, he'll be there.

07:43.640 --> 07:45.005
Why would he bargain with you?

07:46.640 --> 07:49.120
I believe he took a shine to
me when I met him at Brockton.

07:49.320 --> 07:51.129
And from what I observed,

07:51.640 --> 07:53.449
he holds Randall in absolute contempt.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.684
Sounds more like a prayer than a plan.

07:56.320 --> 07:58.084
Well, it's better than no plan at all.

No on guard.

09:12.120 --> 09:13.645
Do you suppose they've killed him?

09:15.400 --> 09:16.401
Why would they?

09:17.440 --> 09:18.885
Because he's a headstrong Fraser.

09:20.520 --> 09:22.170
True, but he's not daft enough

Untie me straight away.

10:31.480 --> 10:32.641

is an assault on the Crown itself.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.050
Just tell us what you know and this will end.

If he's a courier,

11:57.640 --> 12:00.928
maybe one of the dispatches
will say something about Jamie.

If you break that seal...

CLAIRE: It says they were
taking him to the sheriff's court in Beauly

12:15.720 --> 12:16.767
but he escaped.

12:18.440 --> 12:19.726
The army is still searching for him.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.041
Well, nobody's searching.

12:22.240 --> 12:23.685
Those few soldiers back in the glen

12:23.760 --> 12:26.081
were taking MacQuarrie
to the sheriff's court in Beauly.

12:26.560 --> 12:28.085
This dispatch is calling on the garrison

12:28.160 --> 12:30.128
at Fort William to find Jamie.

12:31.080 --> 12:32.241
And if they never read it...

12:32.760 --> 12:34.444
Then they won't know he's escaped.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.163
He won't go back to Lallybroch.

No, he'll go north.

12:46.040 --> 12:47.610
Deeper into the Highlands.

I can see in your eyes
you don't agree with my methods.

13:32.760 --> 13:34.285
Just because
I don't want to see the man murdered?

13:34.360 --> 13:35.725
No, because it bothers you

Murtagh hadn't turned up when he did...

15:28.360 --> 15:29.600
I would have done it myself.

When the bottom log burns to ash,

15:54.720 --> 15:55.801
the next one will take its place.

- you ken your way about the wilds.
- Hmm.

When I was young,
my uncle taught me how to survive outdoors.

16:09.920 --> 16:11.604
We had to take whatever the land offered.

16:12.200 --> 16:13.964
I picked up a few useful tips.

16:14.880 --> 16:16.041
Aye, I'd say so.

16:21.800 --> 16:23.484
Where did you learn to track like that?

16:24.760 --> 16:27.001
Jamie and Ian taught me
when we were young.

or bedevil their suppers.

Bedevil their suppers?

Added a bit of seasoning.

16:50.360 --> 16:51.361
I'd show them the wee beasties

and tell them they'd get plenty
more when they least expected it

16:54.280 --> 16:55.486

18:31.760 --> 18:34.047

to do something when you get home.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.281
Plant potatoes.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.001
Potatoes?

18:39.280 --> 18:40.441
They're no grown in the Highlands.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.201
They will be.

18:44.120 --> 18:45.360
The crop will keep for a long time

18:45.440 --> 18:46.726
and the yield is better than wheat.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.001
Aye.

18:55.240 --> 18:56.571

18:56.640 --> 18:57.687

19:17.400 --> 19:20.006

19:20.560 --> 19:22.483
Didn't make much sense at the time.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.482
But he said if you did,
I was to do as you ask.

19:30.120 --> 19:31.849
Those are the important things to do for now.

19:41.040 --> 19:42.041

20:18.240 --> 20:19.287
Aye.

20:20.040 --> 20:21.326
Can you be more specific?

20:23.120 --> 20:24.929
North, then west.

20:26.240 --> 20:27.651
You're a wealth of information.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.324
Is there a place he might go?

20:30.720 --> 20:31.721
There's no telling.

20:33.520 --> 20:35.090
But the traveling will not be easy for him,

<i>And when you see her pintle rise</i>

32:51.000 --> 32:52.126
<i>You raise your glass</i>

32:52.320 --> 32:54.288
<i>And rowe about their wanton een</i>

32:54.960 --> 32:56.166
(MEN LAUGHING)

32:56.800 --> 32:57.801
CLAIRE: It's no laughing matter.

33:01.200 --> 33:03.806
A song is a song is a song.

33:04.360 --> 33:05.725
No one can claim the words.

33:06.440 --> 33:08.329
They're like birds on the wing.

33:09.120 --> 33:12.203
If one can cage them, they own them.

33:13.120 --> 33:14.565
It's ours, you're filching it.

33:15.320 --> 33:16.446
You won't be using it again.

33:16.520 --> 33:19.171
What my companion is attempting to say

33:20.320 --> 33:23.290
is that it's a very special song.

33:23.840 --> 33:25.842
That's precisely why we chose to use it.

33:26.600 --> 33:28.125
Delivers the crowds.

33:28.640 --> 33:30.210
Not my taste,

33:30.360 --> 33:33.648
but the Highlanders
seem to delight in ribald language.

33:33.720 --> 33:35.370
And we added a proper dancer.

33:38.200 --> 33:39.486
You have a servant.

33:40.280 --> 33:41.805
Clearly you're in no need of funds.

33:43.760 --> 33:45.683
A respectable English lady

33:45.760 --> 33:47.603
traveling through the Scottish countryside

33:47.680 --> 33:49.762
posing as an itinerant performer.

33:50.920 --> 33:51.921
No.

33:53.320 --> 33:56.802
You do this for either politics or love.

34:00.720 --> 34:01.846
It's not politics.

34:02.240 --> 34:03.241
Wise.

34:03.640 --> 34:06.564
You don't want to
involve yourself in His Majesty's affairs.

34:07.360 --> 34:09.886
But love, after money...

34:12.560 --> 34:15.166
...is what matters most in a gypsy's heart.

34:16.080 --> 34:17.320
MURTAGH: Bloody Christ.

34:17.719 --> 34:19.529
Since when do gypsies have hearts?

34:19.600 --> 34:21.568
Spoken by a man who has no soul.

34:21.719 --> 34:22.721
Enough.

34:24.920 --> 34:26.649
I'm searching for my husband

34:27.520 --> 34:29.284
and I have to sing that song.

34:30.480 --> 34:32.608
And once I have found him I promise you,

34:33.159 --> 34:35.639
I will never set foot on stage again.

34:44.360 --> 34:48.045
Give me your word
that you won't perform that song again.

34:53.239 --> 34:54.241
You have my word.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.682
MURTAGH: You might as well
have dropped that money in a ditch.

35:04.640 --> 35:05.801
His word is worth hee-haw.

35:06.120 --> 35:07.770
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

35:08.040 --> 35:09.644
I think it's what Jamie would've done.

35:10.240 --> 35:11.366
You're no listening.

35:12.080 --> 35:14.686
That gypsy all but told you
he'd carry on performing that song

35:14.800 --> 35:15.881
if it earns him money.

35:15.960 --> 35:17.405
I have to believe

35:17.520 --> 35:19.010
that a man who looks you in the eye

35:19.080 --> 35:20.445
and gives you his word will keep it.

35:22.640 --> 35:24.688
The gypsy will keep using the song.

35:25.560 --> 35:26.721
So you'll be singing it.

35:27.240 --> 35:28.241
They'll be singing it.

35:29.400 --> 35:32.290
Jamie won't know which song to come to.

35:35.440 --> 35:36.885
Go on home to Lallybroch.

35:38.120 --> 35:39.963
I'll track the gypsies.

35:40.040 --> 35:41.610
Easier for me on my own.

35:42.320 --> 35:43.890
You won't slow me down then.

35:44.800 --> 35:47.326
No, he is my husband.

35:48.040 --> 35:49.690
You can't understand how that feels.

35:50.640 --> 35:54.008
Besides, I outrank you, do I not?

35:57.880 --> 35:59.370
I'm pledged to the Laird.

35:59.560 --> 36:01.005
And I am his lady.

36:01.920 --> 36:04.207
And I'll continue singing that song

36:04.280 --> 36:05.486
until I find him.

36:19.720 --> 36:20.721
(INAUDIBLE)

36:25.840 --> 36:26.841
(INAUDIBLE)

37:00.880 --> 37:03.565
If you look hard enough,
you might just see the Americas.

37:04.920 --> 37:07.571
It's the only place
you haven't sung that damn song yet.

37:27.800 --> 37:28.801
Cannot sleep?

37:32.000 --> 37:33.001
Of course not.

37:35.120 --> 37:36.121
Good.

37:41.480 --> 37:42.766
What does that mean?

37:45.280 --> 37:46.691
I'm a fool for trailing after you.

37:47.920 --> 37:49.285
At least I ken that much.

37:50.120 --> 37:51.121
But you?

37:52.560 --> 37:54.050
You're stubborn

37:54.120 --> 37:56.441
and you will not listen
to anyone but your own self.

37:58.440 --> 38:01.205
You insisted you'd carry on
singing this song.

38:04.160 --> 38:05.844
We've still no sign of the Laird.

38:07.360 --> 38:09.249
Are you blaming me for our situation?

38:09.920 --> 38:10.921
I am.

38:11.360 --> 38:13.931
This whole farce was your plan.

38:14.040 --> 38:15.371
And it was fine

38:16.480 --> 38:17.970
till your dealings with the gypsies.

38:18.160 --> 38:19.161
Fine?

38:20.120 --> 38:23.567
Nothing about this search has been fine.

38:25.920 --> 38:27.445
Perhaps it has for you

38:27.840 --> 38:30.366
because you've
never lost someone that you've loved.

38:31.920 --> 38:33.331
You ken it all now, do you lass?

38:47.800 --> 38:49.325
I lost someone...

38:52.160 --> 38:55.846
...at a MacKenzie gathering many years ago.

38:57.920 --> 39:00.321
My face had less weather on it then...

39:02.360 --> 39:04.328
...and she was a sonsie lassie...

39:07.640 --> 39:10.007
...but she had another suitor.

39:12.120 --> 39:13.121
So...

39:15.600 --> 39:17.728
...I thought to prove myself worthy of her.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.684
Be the kind of man she'd desire.

39:25.440 --> 39:27.010
During the Tynchal hunt,

39:28.560 --> 39:33.043
I alone killed
a wounded boar using just a dagger.

39:36.720 --> 39:39.121
The MacKenzie was so
impressed by the deed,

39:41.280 --> 39:42.281
he gave me the tusks.

39:45.080 --> 39:47.481
I made them into bracelets

39:47.560 --> 39:50.006
and gave them to the lass as a wedding gift.

40:01.480 --> 40:02.481
It was you?

40:30.280 --> 40:32.282
You think
you're the only one that loves Jamie?

40:35.120 --> 40:36.645
He's a son to me.

40:42.600 --> 40:44.045
I'm sorry.

40:44.120 --> 40:45.121
(CRYING)

40:47.120 --> 40:48.724
I can't bear it.

40:56.480 --> 40:57.641
(MUTTERING INDISTINCTLY)

41:22.000 --> 41:23.490
What are we going to do now?

41:24.000 --> 41:25.161
Where do we go?

41:27.400 --> 41:29.448
Until we ken otherwise,

41:30.160 --> 41:31.844
we go back to the beginning and start again.

41:37.320 --> 41:38.481
All right.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.286
First things first.

41:41.840 --> 41:42.887
The horses,

41:43.720 --> 41:45.245
they need to be fed and watered.

41:48.080 --> 41:49.525
I gave away most of our money.

41:53.480 --> 41:54.925
We'll manage something.

42:17.160 --> 42:18.161
No.

42:21.960 --> 42:23.450
You'll have a long and happy life.

42:34.600 --> 42:35.601
Mr. Ward,

42:37.360 --> 42:39.362
I didn't expect to see you again,

42:39.600 --> 42:41.648
unless you came to have your fortune read.

42:43.480 --> 42:44.606
I broke my word.

42:45.520 --> 42:47.443
We've been performing your song

42:47.520 --> 42:48.931
and doing quite well at it.

42:50.400 --> 42:52.926
I had heard that gypsies aren't trustworthy.

42:53.560 --> 42:54.846
I'd hoped it wasn't true.

42:55.200 --> 42:57.567
Well, I trust you haven't come all this
way looking for absolution.

42:59.760 --> 43:01.205
Is everything all right here, lass?

43:03.960 --> 43:05.371
It's fine.

43:05.440 --> 43:07.090
Mr. Ward was just leaving.

43:12.640 --> 43:14.642
I'm here in the name of love.

43:16.440 --> 43:18.329
We were performing near Achnasheen.

43:18.920 --> 43:20.206
A messenger left word.

43:20.800 --> 43:22.131
And what's that got to do with us?

43:22.200 --> 43:24.362
The message
was for the lass playing your role.

43:25.360 --> 43:26.646
Clearly, it was meant for you.

43:30.760 --> 43:33.081
This message, what did it say?

43:34.160 --> 43:36.447
I don't just give information away.

43:37.800 --> 43:39.962
Even to those with the soul of a gypsy.

43:40.160 --> 43:41.685
I'll give you nothing.

43:42.920 --> 43:44.445
Now, you better leave

43:45.120 --> 43:46.645
before my companion here

43:46.720 --> 43:48.131
decides to lend you a hand.

43:56.640 --> 43:59.291
You're to go to
Glen Rowan Cross with all due haste.

44:02.240 --> 44:03.241
Is it Jamie?

44:03.560 --> 44:04.721
He kens the place.

44:06.800 --> 44:07.801
So do I.

44:10.320 --> 44:11.321
Thank you.

44:13.440 --> 44:14.805
From one gypsy to another.

44:51.480 --> 44:52.481
Jamie!

45:00.200 --> 45:02.043
Sorry to disappoint you, lass.

45:03.760 --> 45:04.807
We were hoping for...

45:04.880 --> 45:07.531
I ken what you were hoping for.

45:10.240 --> 45:11.969
I couldn't send for you by name.

45:14.960 --> 45:19.045
Risk my location being
found by those unsympathetic to the cause.

45:38.320 --> 45:40.368
Smuggling now, are we?

45:41.080 --> 45:42.923
For Prince Charles' nascent rebellion?

45:43.080 --> 45:45.526
I didn't send for you to debate politics.

45:46.440 --> 45:49.011
You can stop your searching.

45:49.280 --> 45:50.850
I've news of Jamie.

45:56.920 --> 45:57.921
He's alive.

45:59.640 --> 46:01.165
He was taken at Achnasheen.

46:03.080 --> 46:04.844
Drawn by your song.

46:07.080 --> 46:08.525
Met six Redcoats face-to-face

46:08.600 --> 46:09.761
around a turn in a path.

46:11.440 --> 46:12.930
One recognized him.

46:14.560 --> 46:15.686
Was he hurt?

46:17.120 --> 46:18.360
He's in Wentworth Prison.

46:19.600 --> 46:22.046
Stood trial three days ago.
Condemned to hang.

46:22.120 --> 46:23.201
When?

46:23.400 --> 46:24.401
Today?

46:24.480 --> 46:25.481
Day after.

46:25.840 --> 46:26.841
Not long.

46:28.520 --> 46:29.521
We have to hurry.

46:29.640 --> 46:30.641
- Wait, wait.
- Hey!

46:30.720 --> 46:32.131
No, no, no, no.

46:32.440 --> 46:33.726
No, Murtagh.

46:33.800 --> 46:35.928
I need to have a word with the lady, alone.

46:43.000 --> 46:44.001
I'll be fine.

47:11.320 --> 47:12.321
Claire,

47:13.880 --> 47:16.326
I understand that you're grieving. I do.

47:16.560 --> 47:18.403
It's hard to accept that Jamie's gone.

47:18.520 --> 47:19.521
I know that.

47:19.920 --> 47:22.810
But you have to let him go.

47:24.600 --> 47:25.601
You said he was still alive.

47:27.240 --> 47:28.446
There must be something we can do.

47:28.520 --> 47:29.521
There is.

47:29.760 --> 47:30.761
Come back with me.

47:32.240 --> 47:33.401
- What?
- I’ll protect you.

47:33.520 --> 47:36.251
I don't need protection. I need my husband.

47:36.400 --> 47:39.210
I can protect you, as your husband.

47:42.080 --> 47:43.286
Get your hands off me.

47:43.360 --> 47:44.361
Now, listen to me, Claire.

47:44.440 --> 47:46.044
I will do no such thing.

47:47.360 --> 47:48.566
Have you no shame?

47:50.920 --> 47:52.649
Your nephew

47:53.440 --> 47:55.408
lies rotting in prison under a death warrant

47:55.480 --> 47:57.289
and you make a play for his wife?

47:57.440 --> 48:00.046
I've never known you to act
like an empty-headed woman before,

48:00.160 --> 48:01.207
so don't start now.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.001
What about Geillis?

48:05.400 --> 48:07.402
I thought she was your true soulmate.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.287
Your star-crossed lover

48:11.360 --> 48:13.249
carrying your forbidden child.

48:14.600 --> 48:17.729
Both of them burned at the stake...

48:19.520 --> 48:21.966
...and here you are
looking for another woman,

48:22.040 --> 48:23.121
her friend,

48:23.800 --> 48:24.801
to warm your bed.

48:25.400 --> 48:27.243
We won't talk about Geillis today.

48:28.280 --> 48:29.281
This is about you.

48:30.960 --> 48:32.246
You're a widow...

48:32.320 --> 48:33.845
Well, if not now, you soon will be.

48:34.200 --> 48:35.804
An English widow.

48:36.080 --> 48:37.127
With no money,

48:37.200 --> 48:38.611
no property to call your own.

48:38.880 --> 48:41.087
Save that poor Fraser land you'll inherit.

48:41.600 --> 48:44.206
And how long do you think it'll
be before Captain Jack Randall

48:44.280 --> 48:46.567
comes knocking at your door at Lallybroch?

48:46.760 --> 48:48.922
The Frasers will protect me,
thank you very much.

48:49.040 --> 48:50.804
In the same way they protected Jamie?

48:51.280 --> 48:53.089
No, you'll be back in his hands

48:53.200 --> 48:54.361
the minute he takes his fancy.

48:54.680 --> 48:57.001
And there's nothing
that those poor farmers can do about it.

48:58.120 --> 49:00.851
I thought those poor farmers

49:00.920 --> 49:03.287
were going to be
the backbone of your Jacobite army.

49:03.440 --> 49:05.966
You're being clever, not wise.

49:07.440 --> 49:10.922
The only way to keep you
and Lallybroch safe

49:11.600 --> 49:13.250
is to come under my protection.

49:13.400 --> 49:15.323
As War Chieftain of the Clan MacKenzie.

49:22.480 --> 49:23.481
Lallybroch?

49:26.400 --> 49:28.129
So that's what this is really about?

49:29.800 --> 49:32.041
You want to control the Fraser lands.

49:34.040 --> 49:35.565
That's what you've wanted all along.

49:39.600 --> 49:42.809
That's why you kept Jamie away for years

49:43.200 --> 49:46.010
by telling him his sister
bore Randall's child.

49:48.200 --> 49:50.089
Because you were hoping for an opportunity

49:50.160 --> 49:51.844
to bring them under the MacKenzie banner

49:51.960 --> 49:53.689
before their rightful Laird could return.

49:53.960 --> 49:55.166
All that may be true.

49:58.680 --> 50:00.250
But it doesn't alter your position.

50:00.600 --> 50:02.523
Now, what would Jamie want you to do?

50:03.240 --> 50:05.891
Well, he wouldn't want me
sleeping with his uncle.

50:06.280 --> 50:08.521
Hey, listen to me. Listen to me.

50:08.840 --> 50:10.490
He loved you, yes, I know that.

50:10.920 --> 50:13.161
More than I suspected
when I proposed you wed.

50:14.360 --> 50:17.967
Now, he was a man of deep feelings.

50:18.040 --> 50:20.930
Don't you dare
speak about him as if he were already dead.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.889
Now you think what you want of me,

50:23.280 --> 50:25.851
of my motives
or of my politics, or even my honor.

50:25.960 --> 50:27.849
But you know... You know Jamie.

50:28.680 --> 50:30.284
You know how he felt about Randall.

50:30.520 --> 50:32.045
If marrying me was the only way

50:32.120 --> 50:33.849
to keep you out of that bastard's hands,

50:34.040 --> 50:35.530
he would tell you to do it.

50:38.600 --> 50:39.647
Now...

50:41.520 --> 50:43.329
...look me in the eye and tell me I'm wrong.

50:53.640 --> 50:54.641
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

51:04.520 --> 51:05.885
How many men are there with you?

51:06.880 --> 51:07.881
What?

51:10.560 --> 51:11.925
- How many?
- Ten.

51:16.760 --> 51:18.922
I know what you're thinking,

51:19.000 --> 51:20.729
(CHUCKLES) but there is no way on earth

51:20.800 --> 51:23.770
that so few men
can force their way into Wentworth Prison.

51:24.360 --> 51:26.203
Jamie led only a handful of men

51:26.280 --> 51:28.089
when he rescued me at Fort William.

51:30.880 --> 51:31.927
What's the matter?

51:32.680 --> 51:34.569
Are you scared you're not as good as him?

51:38.600 --> 51:40.204
I'll not be baited by you, Claire.

51:41.840 --> 51:43.365
You're blinded by love.

51:44.440 --> 51:46.283
Wishing for things that can never be.

51:48.520 --> 51:50.170
Would you give up your dream

51:50.240 --> 51:52.368
of a Stuart king on the throne without trying?

51:53.760 --> 51:54.761
No.

51:55.400 --> 51:57.209
And I won't give up on Jamie without trying.

51:57.400 --> 51:59.050
He'll be dead before you get there.

52:01.800 --> 52:02.801
And what then?

52:07.320 --> 52:08.685
Then I'll marry you.

52:11.640 --> 52:15.122
If there's a chance
that I can save him, then I have to try.

52:21.240 --> 52:22.969
But if I fail...

52:24.480 --> 52:25.811
...or if he's already dead,

52:32.160 --> 52:33.366
I will marry you.

52:36.400 --> 52:37.925
I'll not force any of my men

52:38.000 --> 52:39.001
to go to their deaths.

52:41.760 --> 52:43.285
But I'll not stand in the way of any

52:43.360 --> 52:44.361
that choose to go.

53:06.040 --> 53:07.929
Look, I like the lad.

53:09.560 --> 53:10.561
But it's Wentworth.

53:11.440 --> 53:12.441
There's no chance.

53:13.600 --> 53:15.125
Bloody cowards.

53:22.040 --> 53:24.042
I understand your hesitation.

53:25.520 --> 53:27.761
What I'm asking is daunting,

53:28.320 --> 53:31.164
but I know, if the situation were reversed,

53:31.880 --> 53:34.201
Jamie would come
for every single one of you.

53:34.760 --> 53:36.489
The same MacKenzie blood

53:37.000 --> 53:38.525
runs through all your veins.

54:00.320 --> 54:01.321
WILLIE: I'll go.

54:03.200 --> 54:06.522
Laddie, stop your nonsense
and get back behind me.

54:06.760 --> 54:08.762
You're too green to ken what you're saying.

54:09.520 --> 54:10.931
Jamie's always looked after me.

54:11.240 --> 54:12.765
Protected me.

54:13.160 --> 54:15.162
On the road. At Leech.

54:19.600 --> 54:22.001
And I ken if it was me
about to meet the hangman's noose,

54:23.280 --> 54:26.363
he'd come for me, try to set me free.

54:27.880 --> 54:29.962
Whatever you call for, Mistress Claire.

54:31.440 --> 54:33.204
My life is yours to command.

54:35.840 --> 54:36.841
Thank you, Willie.

54:37.920 --> 54:41.447
You have more courage
than all the rest of them put together.

54:45.560 --> 54:47.085
You honor your blood.

54:48.520 --> 54:49.521
Hell's fire.

54:50.440 --> 54:52.249
Cannot let the wee scunner go alone

54:52.320 --> 54:53.731
and have all the fun, can I, eh?

54:56.840 --> 54:58.490
Aye, me neither.

54:59.560 --> 55:00.607
You see when this goes wrong,

55:01.000 --> 55:03.571
I'm killing you first for getting us involved.

55:03.640 --> 55:06.530
Even before the Redcoats
stretch your scrawny neck.

55:08.560 --> 55:11.484
Now, that was the easy part.

55:14.500 --> 55:22.500
