00:44.252 --> 00:45.702
Come on.

01:13.448 --> 01:15.357
Sorry.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.272
The bailiff summoned him.

01:21.372 --> 01:24.908
It was the Count's wish that
he should be here for the will.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.889
Amen.

03:57.570 --> 04:01.099
Countess, your husband
promised me work.

04:01.199 --> 04:03.351
Be off! Away with you!

04:03.451 --> 04:06.104
My wife and boys are starving!

04:06.204 --> 04:08.565
In God's name, he promised!

04:08.665 --> 04:10.900
He promised!

04:11.000 --> 04:13.034
Down! Get off there! Get off!

04:15.380 --> 04:17.122
They've run over Janos!

04:22.303 --> 04:25.039
- Father!
- Come on!

04:25.139 --> 04:27.167
Well, come on.
What are you waiting for?

04:27.267 --> 04:29.259
Yah! Yah!

04:30.186 --> 04:31.928
Father!

04:34.315 --> 04:36.634
Devil woman!

04:36.734 --> 04:39.102
Devil! Devil!

04:40.363 --> 04:41.813
Go on.

05:02.677 --> 05:08.166
Now, before we proceed to business,
may I present Imre Toth,

05:08.266 --> 05:12.219
the son of your husband's
late friend General Toth.

05:14.063 --> 05:16.848
The Countess Elisabeth Nádasdy.

05:18.151 --> 05:22.263
Captain Dobi,
the steward of the castle.

05:22.363 --> 05:25.058
Master Fabio, the historian.

05:25.158 --> 05:29.562
And the Countess's companion, Julie.

05:29.662 --> 05:33.149
The one person not
yet arrived is Ilona,

05:33.249 --> 05:35.276
the Countess's daughter.

05:35.376 --> 05:37.737
Her father sent for her
when he knew he was dying,

05:37.837 --> 05:39.364
but, alas, too late...

05:39.464 --> 05:41.950
Yes, yes. Let's get on with it.

05:42.050 --> 05:43.542
Please.

05:50.933 --> 05:55.387
"The last will and testament
of Count Ferenc Nádasdy.

05:56.147 --> 05:59.182
To Captain Dobi...

06:00.276 --> 06:02.769
I bequeath my arms and uniforms."

06:08.034 --> 06:10.228
"To Julie Szentes,

06:10.328 --> 06:11.771
1,000 koronas

06:11.871 --> 06:15.608
and food and lodging in my
home for the rest of her days.

06:15.708 --> 06:19.828
To Master Fabio, my library."

06:22.882 --> 06:24.993
"To Imre Toth,

06:25.093 --> 06:27.704
son of my dearest friend
and army companion,

06:27.804 --> 06:29.580
who fought gallantly with me

06:29.680 --> 06:32.417
and saved my life on
more than one occasion,

06:32.517 --> 06:35.920
I bequeath my famous stable

06:36.020 --> 06:38.847
with all the horses and the cottage.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.896
To my beloved wife, Elisabeth...

06:47.907 --> 06:51.735
my fortunes and estates t...

06:54.747 --> 06:59.409
to be divided equally with
our only child, Ilona."

07:04.424 --> 07:08.752
Well, we must respect his wishes.

07:12.014 --> 07:13.916
- That concludes the main...
- Countess, I must apologize...

07:14.016 --> 07:15.877
for my late arrival.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.253
My horse lost a shoe.

07:17.353 --> 07:22.807
Well, now you have all the horseshoes
you'll need... and the horses.

07:25.153 --> 07:27.805
Since we are new neighbors,

07:27.905 --> 07:30.767
doubtless we shall see
much of each other.

07:30.867 --> 07:32.143
The honor will be mine.

07:32.243 --> 07:35.104
"...half a kilo of tobacco yearly.

07:35.204 --> 07:38.775
Sendrey family,
5 forint extra money monthly

07:38.875 --> 07:41.778
and my cottage..."

07:41.878 --> 07:43.821
You wish to see these famous stables?

07:43.921 --> 07:45.865
- Indeed.
- Ah, come this way.

07:45.965 --> 07:48.368
"...5 forint extra money monthly.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.620
And to Miklós Sendrey,

07:50.720 --> 07:55.006
one of my ivory pipes with
half a kilo of tobacco yearly."

07:56.017 --> 07:58.044
It seems you've inherited
a fine library.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.338
Oh, the best in the land.

08:00.438 --> 08:03.299
You cannot imagine
my delight. This way.

08:03.399 --> 08:06.677
And you, my friend...
you, too, I feel are a scholar.

08:06.777 --> 08:10.188
Oh, I don't know. I try
to read as much as I can.

08:17.371 --> 08:19.190
What was she carrying?

08:19.290 --> 08:20.858
A pan of coals...

08:20.958 --> 08:24.237
the solace of widows
and lonely ghouls.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.663
It makes cold beds hot.

08:28.424 --> 08:31.619
Cold beds hot.

08:31.719 --> 08:35.087
It makes cold beds hot.

08:49.904 --> 08:53.641
But there are worse places
to live, and when Ilona returns...

08:53.741 --> 08:55.017
Has she been away long?

08:55.117 --> 08:56.561
Since she was 6 years old.

08:56.661 --> 08:59.730
They sent her to Vienna to
escape the dreaded Turks.

08:59.830 --> 09:03.992
But I'm told that God has favored her.
She's a great beauty.

09:05.711 --> 09:09.198
20 years as steward of this castle,
protector of his lady,

09:09.298 --> 09:10.575
and what do I get for it?

09:10.675 --> 09:13.411
Two suits of armor and a
trunk full of old uniforms.

09:13.511 --> 09:15.037
Ha!

09:15.137 --> 09:17.415
What did you expect?

09:17.515 --> 09:19.292
You think he was a fool?

09:19.392 --> 09:20.585
You're quite right, of course.

09:20.685 --> 09:21.627
Who am I to complain,

09:21.727 --> 09:25.548
when in truth he has left me
the greatest prize of all.

09:25.648 --> 09:28.426
I did not realize I was
bequeathed to you.

09:28.526 --> 09:30.470
Well, you're free now.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.271
To choose whom I please.

09:45.167 --> 09:47.278
You wish me to burn myself, wench?!

09:47.378 --> 09:49.788
Quickly, cold water!

09:53.092 --> 09:57.413
Have I a rival?
Our new neighbor, perhaps?

09:57.513 --> 10:02.168
Countess, I've loved you for 20 years.
I've waited patiently for this day.

10:02.268 --> 10:04.928
Please go. I wish to take my bath.

10:07.648 --> 10:09.307
Leave me.

10:19.118 --> 10:21.444
It's cooler now, madam.

10:22.538 --> 10:24.739
Cooler?

10:27.335 --> 10:28.701
Peel me a peach.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.663
What are you trying to do,
turn my room into a pigsty?

10:38.763 --> 10:39.997
My hands are burned!

10:40.097 --> 10:41.923
Oh, get out!

10:44.602 --> 10:45.844
Go!

11:10.336 --> 11:12.488
Dobi!

11:12.588 --> 11:14.622
Julie!

11:18.886 --> 11:23.131
It's the blood, the girl's blood.

11:24.642 --> 11:26.877
Bring her to me.

11:26.977 --> 11:28.462
What do you want with her?

11:28.562 --> 11:30.256
Bring the girl to me!

11:30.356 --> 11:31.841
Please.

11:31.941 --> 11:35.303
Oh, find some other amusement
for yourself. Excuse me!

11:35.403 --> 11:36.686
Julie...

11:42.952 --> 11:46.195
Julie, you'll help me.

11:47.748 --> 11:49.866
You'll help me, Julie.

11:51.460 --> 11:54.989
All right, I'll fetch her myself.

11:55.089 --> 11:56.623
Take me to her room, now!

11:58.759 --> 12:01.377
Now!

12:19.280 --> 12:22.224
Don't be frightened.

12:22.324 --> 12:24.435
<i>Ring-a-ring o' roses</i>

12:24.535 --> 12:26.646
<i>A pocket full of posies</i>

12:26.746 --> 12:28.689
<i>A-tishoo! A-tishoo!</i>

12:28.789 --> 12:31.324
<i>We all fall down!</i>

12:32.793 --> 12:34.779
<i>Ring-a-ring o' roses</i>

12:34.879 --> 12:37.114
<i>A pocket full of posies</i>

12:37.214 --> 12:39.033
<i>A-tishoo! A-tishoo!</i>

12:39.133 --> 12:41.077
<i>We all fall down!</i>

12:41.177 --> 12:43.037
She went up to the
Countess's room last night,

12:43.137 --> 12:44.872
and that's the last I saw of her.

12:44.972 --> 12:46.749
Her bed isn't slept in.

12:46.849 --> 12:49.168
Oh, Captain...

12:49.268 --> 12:53.506
Have you seen my daughter, Teri,
the Countess's chambermaid?

12:53.606 --> 12:55.216
She's disappeared.

12:55.316 --> 12:56.509
I'm so worried.

12:56.609 --> 13:00.012
How should I know where she is?

13:00.112 --> 13:03.516
Try the whorehouse.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.769
She'd never do that.
She's a pure girl.

13:06.869 --> 13:09.404
He'd know if she was
in the whorehouse.

13:16.629 --> 13:19.831
Dobi! Julie!

13:40.402 --> 13:42.020
What have you done?

13:44.990 --> 13:47.685
Oh, Dobi.

13:47.785 --> 13:49.770
- Where is she?
- Who?

13:49.870 --> 13:51.188
The girl, your chambermaid.

13:51.288 --> 13:53.733
Look at me, Dobi.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.158
Look at me.

14:00.005 --> 14:01.741
And what will your daughter say?

14:01.841 --> 14:04.076
She arrives tomorrow...

14:04.176 --> 14:07.371
and she'll find you
as young as she is.

14:07.471 --> 14:09.505
Will she?

15:01.233 --> 15:02.850
Come on, you! Out!

15:21.086 --> 15:23.621
Oh! Let me go!

15:25.633 --> 15:28.292
Let me go!

15:29.219 --> 15:30.996
Take her.

15:31.096 --> 15:33.290
Oh, you beast!

15:33.390 --> 15:35.459
- Here!
- Let me go!

15:35.559 --> 15:37.086
Oh, please!

15:37.186 --> 15:39.679
Please, let me go!

15:41.106 --> 15:43.474
Oh, there you are.

15:44.777 --> 15:48.097
Oh, are you satisfied?

15:48.197 --> 15:50.808
As you are with your library.

15:50.908 --> 15:52.101
- Come, ride with me.
- No.

15:52.201 --> 15:54.687
No, no, no. The creatures terrify me.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.647
But I brought you a map
for fear of losing you.

15:56.747 --> 15:58.691
Oh, thank you.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.776
And the Countess would
deem it a pleasure

16:00.876 --> 16:04.196
if you would dine with us tonight.

16:04.296 --> 16:08.200
Don't look so miserable.
The fair Ilona arrived at dawn.

16:08.300 --> 16:11.912
I haven't seen her yet.
She's been closeted with her mother.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.163
I'm persuaded.

16:13.263 --> 16:15.291
We dine at 7:00.

16:15.391 --> 16:17.334
Bye!

16:17.434 --> 16:19.503
How do I look?

16:19.603 --> 16:21.755
Do you think our new neighbor
will find me irresistible?

16:21.855 --> 16:25.509
Oh! Is there anyone
who can resist you?

16:25.609 --> 16:26.969
Oh, Julie!

16:27.069 --> 16:28.304
We're in luck.

16:28.404 --> 16:31.140
The Countess is overcome with
the reunion with her daughter

16:31.240 --> 16:32.850
and will take dinner in her room.

16:32.950 --> 16:34.643
Oh, good. And the daughter?

16:34.743 --> 16:37.278
Oh, she'll be down.

16:40.958 --> 16:43.701
Well, you two have met, I believe.

16:48.173 --> 16:51.035
My dear, young lady.
Do you remember me?

16:51.135 --> 16:53.711
My dear Master Fabio.

16:57.141 --> 16:59.710
Have I changed so much?

16:59.810 --> 17:04.589
As a flower changes
from bud to bloom...

17:04.690 --> 17:06.432
past recognition.

17:08.444 --> 17:12.013
Oh, this is my young
friend Imre Toth.

17:12.114 --> 17:13.973
My mother has spoken of you.

17:14.074 --> 17:17.728
I believe your father and mine
were the closest of friends.

17:17.828 --> 17:20.606
Your mother, I hope
she's not too unwell.

17:20.705 --> 17:22.023
Oh, merely fatigued.

17:22.124 --> 17:25.527
She wishes us to remove
her from our minds

17:25.627 --> 17:27.946
and to enjoy ourselves this evening.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.997
Shall we eat, then?

17:31.258 --> 17:33.577
That is your mother's chair.

17:33.677 --> 17:37.046
Ah, yes, of course.

17:37.973 --> 17:40.084
Don't you remember
any of your life here?

17:40.184 --> 17:42.211
Oh, yes, many things.

17:42.311 --> 17:43.761
One story in particular.

17:44.813 --> 17:46.131
The day of my departure...

17:46.231 --> 17:48.801
I offer a toast to the new arrival...

17:48.901 --> 17:50.260
Oh, a toast.

17:50.360 --> 17:53.764
In the wine so much loved
by her dear father.

17:53.864 --> 17:56.058
Not only the taste, he used
to say, but the color...

17:56.158 --> 17:58.519
the color of bull's blood.

17:58.619 --> 18:00.437
Ilona.

18:00.537 --> 18:02.231
Ilona.

18:02.331 --> 18:04.525
Pray continue with
your delightful story.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.777
Oh, but I cannot remember.

18:06.877 --> 18:08.153
The day of your departure.

18:08.253 --> 18:09.071
Ah, yes.

18:09.171 --> 18:11.031
I was swimming in the lake

18:11.131 --> 18:14.625
when I spied a man on
the bank cutting roses.

18:15.844 --> 18:20.124
The finest full-blooded blooms.

18:20.224 --> 18:21.375
Who could it be?

18:21.475 --> 18:23.794
The gardener?

18:23.894 --> 18:25.921
No, he was too upright of bearing.

18:26.021 --> 18:27.548
A thief?

18:27.648 --> 18:31.100
He was just too far away
from me to recognize him.

18:33.028 --> 18:35.931
And modesty forbade me
from leaving the water.

18:36.031 --> 18:38.142
Modesty!

18:38.242 --> 18:43.814
Later, I saw the same roses
in my mother's bedroom.

18:43.914 --> 18:46.358
I asked her who had
given them to her,

18:46.458 --> 18:49.862
and she said,
"One of my secret lovers."

18:49.962 --> 18:52.698
Enchanting.

18:52.798 --> 18:56.785
I was confused. What could she mean?

18:56.885 --> 18:59.455
She promised to tell
me when I grew up.

18:59.555 --> 19:03.751
And tonight, before I
came down to dinner,

19:03.851 --> 19:06.795
I had my answer.

19:06.895 --> 19:08.505
And the name of the man...

19:08.605 --> 19:09.715
Ah?

19:09.815 --> 19:12.183
It was Uncle Dobi!

19:18.991 --> 19:21.018
But I have talked
enough about myself.

19:21.118 --> 19:23.228
Help me rediscover my home

19:23.328 --> 19:27.191
and tell me about your life,
and your plans, and your family.

19:27.291 --> 19:30.284
Well, I really don't
know where to begin.

19:33.589 --> 19:35.623
Uncle Dobi!

20:36.652 --> 20:38.929
No! I want to get out!

20:39.029 --> 20:42.523
I want to get out!

20:44.243 --> 20:46.145
This way.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.771
Very nice.

20:47.871 --> 20:49.356
Raphael. Do you like it?

20:49.456 --> 20:51.358
- Raphael?
- Yes.

20:51.458 --> 20:53.325
I like it.

20:56.171 --> 20:57.865
- My grandfather.
- Hmm.

20:57.965 --> 21:01.702
His weakness was women.
He died in the arms of a kitchen maid.

21:01.802 --> 21:04.246
Hmm? Then I salute him.

21:04.346 --> 21:06.186
It's the only way to die.

21:08.809 --> 21:10.043
His wife.

21:10.143 --> 21:12.462
Hmm.

21:12.562 --> 21:14.388
No doubt a great beauty of her time.

21:17.192 --> 21:20.603
Shh, quietly past my mother's room.

21:24.199 --> 21:27.352
And this is your father.

21:27.452 --> 21:30.105
What a brave and generous man he was.

21:30.205 --> 21:31.982
Yes.

21:32.082 --> 21:34.985
Hmm.

21:35.085 --> 21:36.778
Does he look as you remember him?

21:36.878 --> 21:38.322
Oh, much the same.

21:38.422 --> 21:40.831
Come with me. Come, quickly.

22:23.425 --> 22:25.953
Will you live here now with your
mother or return to Vienna?

22:26.053 --> 22:27.996
I haven't decided yet. And you?

22:28.096 --> 22:31.833
Oh, I feel already this is my home...

22:31.933 --> 22:34.677
the first proper home of my life.

22:35.479 --> 22:39.216
But the war is not yet over,
and I may be recalled to duty.

22:39.316 --> 22:42.803
But until that happens, I shall stay.

22:42.903 --> 22:46.807
And if you leave, I swear
to you, I shall take my horses...

22:46.907 --> 22:48.058
All of them?

22:48.158 --> 22:50.192
All of them... and follow you.

22:51.870 --> 22:54.738
But I am unworthy of
such a sacrifice.

22:55.582 --> 22:57.658
Let me be the judge of that.

23:06.968 --> 23:08.078
Oh, no.

23:08.178 --> 23:11.630
We have our reputations to think of.

23:12.557 --> 23:13.875
We've only just met.

23:13.975 --> 23:15.342
When can I see you again?

23:16.520 --> 23:18.922
Sunday. We'll ride
together on Sunday.

23:19.022 --> 23:21.515
Two days? Impossible!

23:22.359 --> 23:23.343
Tomorrow, then.

23:23.443 --> 23:26.763
But late, when the others are asleep.

23:26.863 --> 23:29.433
You'll come to the small
door below the tower,

23:29.533 --> 23:31.518
and I will put a
candle in the window.

23:31.618 --> 23:33.729
That will mean all is well.

23:33.829 --> 23:36.488
Oh, but now you must go.

23:57.144 --> 24:01.840
Tell me, Nanny, how do
you find our little mistress?

24:01.940 --> 24:04.718
Has she not exceeded
your wildest dreams?

24:04.818 --> 24:06.887
In what way, Master Fabio?

24:06.987 --> 24:08.347
Well, in every way.

24:08.447 --> 24:11.350
A girl of barely 19 years, so...

24:11.450 --> 24:15.270
mature of bearing, wit, and manners.

24:15.370 --> 24:16.563
Indeed?

24:16.663 --> 24:19.483
You know, one thing puzzles me.

24:19.583 --> 24:22.569
I always thought she
resembled her father.

24:22.669 --> 24:24.912
Now she's the image of her mother!

24:29.301 --> 24:31.870
Oh, don't you share my feelings?

24:31.970 --> 24:35.040
I think you grow old, Master Fabio.

24:35.140 --> 24:37.334
And your memory's confused.

24:37.434 --> 24:39.252
Then let that pass.

24:39.352 --> 24:41.970
One never quarrels with a nurse.

24:46.234 --> 24:48.477
Unless one wants a box on the ears!

24:51.114 --> 24:52.898
Box on the ears!

25:40.497 --> 25:43.031
Oh!

26:02.394 --> 26:05.053
Come on. Quietly.

26:06.189 --> 26:09.134
Shh. Shh.

26:09.234 --> 26:11.268
Quietly.

26:53.945 --> 26:56.431
It's... It's impossible.

26:56.531 --> 26:58.941
Ah!

28:28.498 --> 28:30.734
My darling.

28:30.834 --> 28:33.660
I thought today would never end.

28:38.258 --> 28:40.334
Say you love me.

28:41.511 --> 28:43.872
- Say it.
- Yes.

28:43.972 --> 28:47.591
Yes, yes, I love you. Yes.

29:07.662 --> 29:11.323
Julie!

29:13.084 --> 29:14.361
Julie.

29:14.461 --> 29:15.528
Countess?

29:15.628 --> 29:17.746
Oh, Julie!

29:20.675 --> 29:23.495
Oh, Julie, please don't
let him see me like this!

29:23.595 --> 29:27.290
Send him away!
Please, Julie, send him away!

29:27.390 --> 29:30.502
Roll up, everybody!
All the fun of the circus!

29:30.602 --> 29:32.879
In the marketplace tonight!

29:32.979 --> 29:35.965
See the animals...
lions, monkeys, camels.

29:36.065 --> 29:37.967
The Indian fakir walking on nails.

29:38.067 --> 29:40.762
The fattest woman in the world.

29:40.862 --> 29:43.348
Join the gypsies dancing!

29:43.448 --> 29:45.392
Roll up! Roll up!

29:45.492 --> 29:47.185
All the fun of the circus!

29:47.285 --> 29:49.562
In the marketplace tonight!

29:49.662 --> 29:52.572
Music!

30:44.717 --> 30:47.412
Don't you want to see me
young and happy again?

30:47.512 --> 30:49.831
So that you can make
love to young officers?

30:49.931 --> 30:52.917
I'd rather have you as you are

30:53.017 --> 30:54.419
than see you parading yourself

30:54.519 --> 30:56.546
like some jaded young
slut from the whorehouse.

30:56.646 --> 30:58.298
At least there's dignity in age!

30:58.398 --> 30:59.758
You are cruel.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.509
You have never loved me.

31:01.609 --> 31:04.179
Oh, yes, I've loved you.

31:04.279 --> 31:06.473
But can't you see what will happen?

31:06.573 --> 31:08.892
You'll go insane...

31:08.992 --> 31:10.935
or the bailiffs will
take you and hang you.

31:11.035 --> 31:13.938
If that should happen,
then don't forget...

31:14.038 --> 31:16.073
you'll be there next to me.

31:19.627 --> 31:21.863
- Have you spoken to him?
- Yes, my dear.

31:21.963 --> 31:23.239
He was not offended.

31:23.339 --> 31:26.785
I told him you left because you
heard your mother calling for you.

31:26.885 --> 31:29.961
And he hopes you'll go riding
with him today as you arranged.

31:31.931 --> 31:34.542
Riding with him?

31:34.642 --> 31:35.919
But how can I?

31:36.019 --> 31:38.678
How can I go riding with him?

31:40.982 --> 31:43.016
Julie...

31:45.528 --> 31:48.605
You will find me someone
and bring her here.

31:49.365 --> 31:50.892
Yes, Countess.

31:50.992 --> 31:54.729
But first tell me what news of
the little one, our real daughter?

31:54.829 --> 31:55.939
I'm so anxious.

31:56.039 --> 31:58.740
She should be here by now.

32:00.168 --> 32:04.329
- But didn't Captain Dobi tell you?
- No.

32:06.633 --> 32:08.827
The Danube flooded where
she would've crossed.

32:08.927 --> 32:12.372
Oh, my poor child.

32:12.472 --> 32:14.249
She is quite safe.

32:14.349 --> 32:17.467
Now, Julie, do as I ask.

32:28.988 --> 32:30.355
Countess.

32:33.743 --> 32:37.028
Will the Countess have
her fortune told?

32:45.672 --> 32:48.658
Two days she's been gone,
and no news of her.

32:48.758 --> 32:51.786
If you ask me, that Countess
knows what's happened to her.

32:51.886 --> 32:55.373
Yes, tell him how the old
witch used to treat her.

32:55.473 --> 32:57.959
Tell him how she used
to burn her and hit her.

32:58.059 --> 33:00.253
Aye, yes, that's right, she did.

33:00.353 --> 33:01.629
Quiet!

33:01.729 --> 33:04.340
You stupid, ignorant people!

33:04.440 --> 33:05.925
Show a bit of respect
for the Countess!

33:06.025 --> 33:07.385
Why should we?

33:07.485 --> 33:10.096
For your food and the
warmth of this kitchen!

33:10.196 --> 33:11.639
And the guns of the
soldiers that protect you

33:11.739 --> 33:14.183
from the Turks and the outlaws!

33:14.283 --> 33:16.436
You ungrateful lot.

33:16.536 --> 33:18.855
You're the envy of the village,
you know that?

33:18.955 --> 33:22.317
So be satisfied and
keep your mouths shut!

33:22.417 --> 33:25.028
I just want to see my Teri again.

33:25.128 --> 33:27.662
My little girl.

33:28.589 --> 33:30.825
I just want to see her again.

33:30.925 --> 33:31.784
Alive.

33:31.884 --> 33:34.829
She'll turn up. They always do.

33:34.929 --> 33:39.000
Probably hiding out in
the forest somewhere.

33:39.100 --> 33:42.170
Anyway, how many other
children have you got?

33:42.270 --> 33:43.963
Seven.

33:44.063 --> 33:46.007
Well, what are you worrying about?

33:46.107 --> 33:49.893
You won't know the difference!

33:53.322 --> 33:56.309
I see a new love in your life.

33:56.409 --> 33:59.896
He will lift away the black
veil of your widowhood,

33:59.996 --> 34:02.190
and you will be young
in your heart again.

34:02.290 --> 34:04.692
Thank you, my child.

34:04.792 --> 34:06.618
Julie?

34:17.179 --> 34:19.630
Beautiful!

34:21.266 --> 34:24.167
Oh, it's beautiful!

34:26.067 --> 34:29.467
Oh, it's beautiful!

35:05.520 --> 35:07.470
Oh!

35:13.194 --> 35:15.179
You'll forgive me for last night?

35:15.279 --> 35:18.141
Mm.

35:18.241 --> 35:20.525
Julie explained everything.

35:26.207 --> 35:28.192
How's your mother?

35:28.292 --> 35:29.777
A little better.

35:29.877 --> 35:32.864
- Still confined to her room.
- Yes.

35:32.964 --> 35:35.533
My father's death. My own homecoming.

35:35.633 --> 35:38.077
She'll be better.

35:38.177 --> 35:39.454
She'll be...

35:39.554 --> 35:41.755
very much better.

35:43.766 --> 35:45.126
You're...

35:45.226 --> 35:47.010
Yes?

35:48.354 --> 35:50.513
You're so beautiful.

36:50.082 --> 36:52.826
Jump!

36:54.837 --> 36:56.996
- Just look at that.
- Yes.

36:58.090 --> 36:59.707
Come on.

37:08.434 --> 37:11.420
What is it?

37:11.520 --> 37:14.389
Nothing.

37:15.107 --> 37:18.344
I just can't get used to my
good fortune, that's all.

37:18.444 --> 37:21.180
Two weeks ago I was just another
young soldier with my unit,

37:21.280 --> 37:25.643
and here I am, a man of some means

37:25.743 --> 37:29.647
with a most beautiful
woman at my side.

37:29.747 --> 37:31.399
I share your good fortune.

37:31.499 --> 37:32.900
But can you really love me?

37:33.000 --> 37:34.443
Of course I can!

37:34.543 --> 37:36.786
Why do you ask such a silly question?

37:37.964 --> 37:40.867
Because you're a young countess...

37:40.967 --> 37:42.869
and I'm only the son of a soldier.

37:42.969 --> 37:45.371
A very brave soldier.

37:45.471 --> 37:47.540
- A general.
- True.

37:47.640 --> 37:51.294
But I cannot trade on his reputation.

37:51.394 --> 37:54.422
I have my own way to make.

37:54.522 --> 37:57.223
And by your standards,
I have much to learn.

37:58.567 --> 38:00.435
Then let me teach you.

38:16.127 --> 38:19.238
What's your business
with those two villains?

38:19.338 --> 38:21.199
I saw them not two hours ago

38:21.299 --> 38:24.785
creeping to the forest
with a heavy... load.

38:24.885 --> 38:27.997
They're friends of Janco,
the gamekeeper.

38:28.097 --> 38:30.041
They take his provisions.

38:30.141 --> 38:32.251
That's what you saw, my friend.

38:32.351 --> 38:34.128
Oh.

38:34.228 --> 38:37.972
Was it? Yes, well, he...
he must have a big appetite.

38:42.987 --> 38:44.138
Oh, no, no, no, no.

38:44.238 --> 38:47.141
It somewhat dulls my senses
at this time of day.

38:47.241 --> 38:48.935
Oh, drink, Fabio.

38:49.035 --> 38:51.187
Drink to the Countess Ilona.

38:51.287 --> 38:53.022
Well, if you insist.

38:53.122 --> 38:55.198
The Countess Ilona.

38:57.668 --> 39:00.905
While we're about it, what's
happened to Countess Elisabeth?

39:01.005 --> 39:03.616
Is she going to stay
in her room forever?

39:03.716 --> 39:08.120
She can't be very ill or she'd
have called her physician.

39:08.220 --> 39:13.501
And I can't believe that it's
widowhood that detains her.

39:13.601 --> 39:16.796
What are you worrying about, Fabio?

39:16.896 --> 39:18.805
It's a better place
without her, isn't it?

39:37.541 --> 39:39.951
Oh, I'm so happy!

39:41.003 --> 39:42.203
Then will you marry me?

39:43.464 --> 39:45.999
Yes. Yes, of course I will!

39:47.718 --> 39:49.704
- I will speak to your mother.
- No.

39:49.804 --> 39:51.664
- Huh?
- Leave her to me.

39:51.764 --> 39:53.332
Why? You fear she'll object?

39:53.432 --> 39:56.961
Oh, don't be silly.
She adores you already.

39:57.061 --> 40:00.096
But she's old and
needs to be humored.

40:01.982 --> 40:03.551
Do it quickly.

40:03.651 --> 40:06.269
- Speak to her tomorrow.
- Yes.

40:20.960 --> 40:23.077
Hey, look!

40:24.588 --> 40:26.664
All right. Come on.

40:55.786 --> 40:57.355
In that tree.

40:57.455 --> 40:59.899
- Hey, there's one.
- Where?

40:59.999 --> 41:02.075
No, it's not. Come on.

41:03.961 --> 41:06.322
- Look, there's one!
- Hey!

41:06.422 --> 41:08.699
Come on. I'll get it.

41:08.799 --> 41:10.826
Come on, slow coach.

41:10.926 --> 41:12.919
Ow!

41:14.013 --> 41:16.881
Help! Help!

41:18.517 --> 41:19.335
Help!

41:19.435 --> 41:20.961
Married?

41:21.061 --> 41:23.547
You are insane.

41:23.647 --> 41:27.385
Don't you realize that you get
uglier each time you get old?

41:27.485 --> 41:29.595
And you can't go on killing forever.

41:29.695 --> 41:31.972
Why not, with you
and Julie to help me?

41:32.072 --> 41:34.225
And what about Fabio
and the servants?

41:34.325 --> 41:35.851
Oh, you don't fear Fabio.

41:35.951 --> 41:37.728
He's not such a fool.

41:37.828 --> 41:39.570
We're quite safe.

41:40.581 --> 41:42.657
And I am happy.

41:44.502 --> 41:47.495
You don't begrudge me that, do you?

41:53.052 --> 41:54.662
Where are you going?

41:54.762 --> 41:56.622
To meet your fiancé.

41:56.722 --> 41:58.582
We're signing the deeds
of the inheritance,

41:58.682 --> 42:01.252
so I'll have the pleasure
of his company tonight.

42:01.352 --> 42:05.089
Tell him that the Countess
Elisabeth approves of the marriage

42:05.189 --> 42:08.391
and has made you responsible
for the arrangements.

42:10.945 --> 42:13.139
To hell with the Countess Elisabeth!

42:13.239 --> 42:16.392
Shh. Don't be so angry.

42:16.492 --> 42:19.986
I haven't forgotten you. I promise.

42:22.998 --> 42:24.150
No.

42:24.250 --> 42:25.734
Not now, Dobi.

42:25.834 --> 42:27.778
- When?
- Soon.

42:27.878 --> 42:29.363
Tonight?

42:29.463 --> 42:31.289
If you wish.

42:33.259 --> 42:35.293
I'll be here.

42:42.685 --> 42:45.296
My God, she's so white.

42:45.396 --> 42:47.173
Any of you seen her before?

42:47.273 --> 42:48.514
- No.
- No.

42:50.109 --> 42:51.552
Are there any gypsies 'round here?

42:51.652 --> 42:55.222
I've seen a few girls
like her with the circus.

42:55.322 --> 42:57.725
In the marketplace last night.

42:57.825 --> 42:59.442
Go on.

43:22.141 --> 43:24.710
All right, all right,
I'm not arresting you.

43:24.810 --> 43:27.512
Not unless you've got a
murderer hidden in there.

43:28.939 --> 43:32.183
Have you seen anyone with a
gypsy girl going into the forest?

43:57.259 --> 43:59.203
No!

43:59.303 --> 44:01.413
Oh, no! Let go of me!

44:01.513 --> 44:04.583
Let go! Help! Help!

44:04.683 --> 44:06.467
Help!

44:27.956 --> 44:30.366
Why do they stare at us?

44:31.710 --> 44:34.905
- Fear.
- Fear? Fear of what?

44:35.005 --> 44:37.700
As a dog fears its master.

44:37.800 --> 44:40.619
But a dog is also keen
to serve its master.

44:40.719 --> 44:42.746
I fear we have no service.

44:42.846 --> 44:46.299
Boy, a flagon of wine. Speed.

44:48.060 --> 44:50.636
Hey, another tankard here.

45:01.532 --> 45:03.976
Well, there you are, Lieutenant.

45:04.076 --> 45:05.769
You are now the undisputed possessor

45:05.869 --> 45:09.572
of 34 horses and 59 mares.

45:11.417 --> 45:14.320
So, what will you do with them, eh?

45:14.420 --> 45:18.240
Make a gift of them to my
good friend the captain here?

45:18.340 --> 45:20.075
Or will you stay on in these parts?

45:20.175 --> 45:22.703
I have excellent reasons
for staying on.

45:22.803 --> 45:25.331
The boy believes
himself to be in love.

45:25.431 --> 45:28.083
Ah. May one ask with whom?

45:28.183 --> 45:29.759
It's no secret.

45:30.394 --> 45:31.545
The Countess Ilona.

45:31.645 --> 45:33.631
They are to be married.

45:33.731 --> 45:35.799
Has she returned? I'd no idea.

45:35.899 --> 45:38.427
- My heartiest congratulations.
- Thank you.

45:38.527 --> 45:40.471
- Captain.
- Yes, Sergeant, what is it?

45:40.571 --> 45:42.222
- It's the gypsy girl, sir.
- The what?

45:42.322 --> 45:44.975
From the circus.
We've got her outside.

45:45.075 --> 45:48.270
She's in a horrible state, sir.
Blood's all gone.

45:48.370 --> 45:50.230
What are you talking about?

45:50.330 --> 45:52.566
Drained out of her, sir.
She's as white as chalk.

45:52.666 --> 45:55.076
The villagers,
they're getting frightened.

45:55.753 --> 45:59.490
Ah, Ziza, my little dumpling!

45:59.590 --> 46:01.992
You know the captain?

46:02.092 --> 46:04.620
- I've made his acquaintance.
- Yes.

46:04.720 --> 46:06.914
But one acquaintance you haven't
made is Lieutenant Toth,

46:07.014 --> 46:09.291
the young man who
stands but an inch away

46:09.391 --> 46:11.043
from marriage to a
lady of noble birth.

46:11.143 --> 46:13.087
They'll make a fine pair.

46:13.187 --> 46:17.174
But not as fine a pair as these, eh?

46:17.274 --> 46:21.102
The lady has a sizzling wit.

47:20.087 --> 47:22.364
Captain!

47:22.464 --> 47:24.783
Yes, Sergeant, what is it?

47:24.883 --> 47:27.661
Oh, very well. Excuse me, gentlemen.

47:27.761 --> 47:29.997
My watchdog calls.

47:30.097 --> 47:31.623
I shall return.

47:31.723 --> 47:34.334
Come on, then, take me to
this bloodless corpse of yours.

47:34.434 --> 47:36.385
Oh, Babus!

48:28.322 --> 48:30.140
She's very good.

48:30.240 --> 48:32.983
Babus, more!

48:37.789 --> 48:39.691
Oh. Do you want her?

48:39.791 --> 48:41.401
Ziza?

48:41.501 --> 48:43.946
No, she's for you, my friend.

48:44.046 --> 48:46.031
Your need is greater.

48:46.131 --> 48:48.033
Not tonight.

48:48.133 --> 48:50.327
No, you have need of her tonight.

48:50.427 --> 48:52.419
But I'm spoken for!

48:53.513 --> 48:55.290
Tell me, Dobi...

48:55.390 --> 48:57.501
I am curious to know.

48:57.601 --> 49:01.004
A man of your position and authority,

49:01.104 --> 49:03.757
why have you never got married, huh?

49:03.857 --> 49:05.300
Don't you believe in it?

49:05.400 --> 49:06.885
It fits some people.

49:06.985 --> 49:10.055
I think you should be married...

49:10.155 --> 49:11.807
to the Countess Elisabeth.

49:11.907 --> 49:14.476
She's free, well-seasoned.

49:14.576 --> 49:17.187
We shall have a double wedding!

49:17.287 --> 49:18.480
Will you drink to that?

49:18.580 --> 49:20.691
Why should a man be
a slave to one woman

49:20.791 --> 49:21.984
when he can have the pick of any?

49:22.084 --> 49:25.153
Oh, but if that woman
embodies all the virtues?

49:25.253 --> 49:28.866
Mistress, friend, and mother in one?
Does such a woman exist?

49:28.966 --> 49:31.375
You know she does.

49:32.844 --> 49:35.004
And I have found her.

49:36.264 --> 49:38.834
Then you are blessed indeed.

49:38.934 --> 49:39.835
Mm.

49:39.935 --> 49:41.545
But also vulnerable.

49:41.645 --> 49:42.838
How so?

49:42.938 --> 49:45.048
Being so dazzled by
the light of your love

49:45.148 --> 49:48.684
that you cannot see a man
steal upon you in the dark.

49:49.945 --> 49:53.181
Ah, will you buy some beads, hmm?

49:53.281 --> 49:56.018
Ah, or a Turkish dagger?

49:56.118 --> 49:57.561
To protect you from your enemies.

49:57.661 --> 50:00.564
Why should I have enemies?

50:00.664 --> 50:03.317
All men have enemies.

50:03.417 --> 50:06.904
But blessed men more
since they are envied.

50:07.004 --> 50:08.780
Away, fool!

50:08.880 --> 50:10.240
This is Turkish talk.

50:10.340 --> 50:11.825
Ziza!

50:11.925 --> 50:13.285
Me, Captain?

50:13.385 --> 50:15.495
Our young friend is
much taken with you.

50:15.595 --> 50:17.247
- No, no, no, she's for you, my friend.
- Really?

50:17.347 --> 50:21.126
Oh, come on, my friend.
Enjoy her while you can.

50:21.226 --> 50:25.262
What's the matter?
Thinking of your lady love?

50:32.821 --> 50:35.314
Julie!

50:50.047 --> 50:52.407
Oh, Dobi!

50:52.507 --> 50:55.911
What's the joke?
Come on, let me in on it.

50:56.011 --> 50:57.579
I've made a little bet with him.

50:57.679 --> 50:58.872
Over me?

50:58.972 --> 51:01.166
- I'll have him any time. He's beautiful.
- Will you?

51:01.266 --> 51:03.592
That he can't get you
into the castle unseen.

51:04.895 --> 51:06.338
The castle?

51:06.438 --> 51:08.632
You win the bet. I'm not going there.

51:08.732 --> 51:10.842
Why not?

51:10.942 --> 51:13.345
Haven't you heard what they're
saying about the Countess?

51:13.445 --> 51:14.471
- No.
- She's a witch.

51:14.571 --> 51:15.722
A witch?

51:15.822 --> 51:17.599
All the Báthorys are witches.

51:17.699 --> 51:20.018
Sold their souls to the devil.

51:20.118 --> 51:22.521
Their ancestor was a
seven-headed dragon.

51:22.621 --> 51:23.522
No, Ziza!

51:23.622 --> 51:26.448
And the worst of them all
is the Countess Elisabeth.

51:29.419 --> 51:30.779
50 koronas if you come with us.

51:30.879 --> 51:32.572
50?

51:32.672 --> 51:35.075
And my protection from the witch.

51:35.175 --> 51:37.452
- Promise?
- Promise.

51:37.552 --> 51:38.829
Oh, well.

51:38.929 --> 51:41.915
I was never one to listen
to gossip. Come on.

51:42.015 --> 51:43.208
- Come on where?
- We're going. Come on.

51:43.308 --> 51:45.252
Where are we going?
Just a minute. My hat.

51:45.352 --> 51:46.593
Come on.

52:02.744 --> 52:05.779
Forgive me.

52:22.180 --> 52:25.466
Shh!

52:27.144 --> 52:30.346
- Dobi!
- Quiet!

52:31.982 --> 52:33.925
- Ziza!
- Oh.

52:34.025 --> 52:35.135
Shh!

52:35.235 --> 52:37.603
Ziza!

52:47.622 --> 52:48.857
Where are we?

52:48.957 --> 52:52.569
Oh, yes.

52:52.669 --> 52:54.946
We're going that way, Ziza.

52:55.046 --> 52:58.158
I don't go that way, I don't
go that way, I go that way.

52:58.258 --> 53:00.410
Down that way we go.

53:00.510 --> 53:01.661
- Dobi.
- Shh!

53:01.761 --> 53:02.996
Shh!

53:03.096 --> 53:05.672
Shush. Shh.

53:41.885 --> 53:44.253
Have fun, my little ones.

53:46.306 --> 53:47.631
Come on, darling.

53:57.192 --> 53:59.302
Oh. The gallant Captain.

53:59.402 --> 54:01.596
I mistook you for a ghost.

54:01.696 --> 54:04.599
And I mistook you for a villain
and damn near cut your throat!

54:04.699 --> 54:05.809
Oh.

54:05.909 --> 54:07.144
What's your business?

54:07.244 --> 54:11.189
Uh, well, I... I found
a most intriguing map

54:11.289 --> 54:14.776
that marks doors and passages
that I never knew existed.

54:14.876 --> 54:17.529
I've been tracing them. Look.

54:17.629 --> 54:19.121
At this hour?

54:20.340 --> 54:22.909
My mind is most alert at night...

54:23.009 --> 54:24.286
while people sleep.

54:24.386 --> 54:28.165
Well, do as you please,
but keep to the library.

54:28.265 --> 54:30.375
Don't go prowling.

54:30.475 --> 54:32.836
You might frighten somebody.

54:32.936 --> 54:35.971
Or end up a ghost myself.

55:06.094 --> 55:08.754
You cheated me.

55:10.140 --> 55:13.793
You knew this would happen,
and you've made a fool of me.

55:13.893 --> 55:15.886
No, I promise.

55:18.440 --> 55:20.383
What do you want?

55:20.483 --> 55:22.177
That we should make love?

55:22.277 --> 55:24.346
Now, as you are?

55:24.446 --> 55:26.306
Like two old fools
fumbling at each other?

55:26.406 --> 55:28.391
Don't be cruel.

55:28.491 --> 55:29.893
Help me.

55:29.993 --> 55:32.646
Why should I help you, huh?

55:32.746 --> 55:33.939
You don't want me.

55:34.039 --> 55:36.316
It's him... Imre.

55:36.416 --> 55:39.861
It's him you're thinking about and
how you'll look for him tomorrow.

55:39.961 --> 55:41.613
No...

55:41.713 --> 55:43.573
But you still need me, don't you?

55:43.673 --> 55:46.826
As a whore needs her pander.

55:46.926 --> 55:51.164
But there's just one customer who
doesn't want you, young or old...

55:51.264 --> 55:53.750
your little lover.

55:53.850 --> 55:56.878
I'll show you.

55:56.978 --> 56:00.340
- Come and watch him...
- No.

56:00.440 --> 56:04.685
In his satisfaction with
a real young woman.

56:06.446 --> 56:07.806
Now...

56:07.906 --> 56:11.893
lying on my bed...

56:11.993 --> 56:15.563
coupling with the
cheapest whore in town!

56:15.663 --> 56:18.448
- No, I don't want to see...
- Come!

56:26.216 --> 56:27.617
Come...

56:27.717 --> 56:29.619
see...

56:29.719 --> 56:33.839
your young lover, Imre...

56:36.142 --> 56:38.176
with that!

56:44.484 --> 56:45.593
What's your game, eh?

56:45.693 --> 56:48.096
Pushing me onto a little bastard
who doesn't want me?

56:48.196 --> 56:50.390
What's the matter? Can't he do it?

56:50.490 --> 56:52.434
You ought to give him a few lessons.

56:52.534 --> 56:54.728
- A whole night I've wasted!
- Stay in there!

56:54.828 --> 56:57.647
I want my money!

56:57.747 --> 57:00.608
You arranged it.

57:00.708 --> 57:02.235
No, I didn't.

57:02.335 --> 57:03.653
Be quiet!

57:03.753 --> 57:06.531
You brought that slut in here.

57:06.631 --> 57:07.741
Good.

57:07.841 --> 57:10.834
How very thoughtful of you.

57:12.137 --> 57:13.955
Imre doesn't need her.

57:14.055 --> 57:15.707
I do!

57:15.807 --> 57:18.925
Bring her to me... now!

57:20.687 --> 57:22.596
Now!

57:29.612 --> 57:31.890
Where's my money, then? Where is it?

57:31.990 --> 57:33.933
- It's not my fault the bastard's asleep.
- Leave me alone.

57:34.033 --> 57:36.644
I want my 50 koronas!
Did you hear me?

57:36.744 --> 57:38.862
I want my money!

57:44.919 --> 57:47.197
- A hundred?
- For a better client.

57:47.297 --> 57:49.657
You had no fun here.
Well, you should now.

57:49.757 --> 57:51.409
It's not a man. It's a woman.

57:51.509 --> 57:54.287
She may ask some special favors.

57:54.387 --> 57:58.382
For a hundred, I'd take
on a whole Turkish harem.

58:52.737 --> 58:55.265
Dobi!

58:55.365 --> 58:56.975
Dobi, look at me!

58:57.075 --> 58:59.477
I did the same as before,
and it didn't work! I don't know.

58:59.577 --> 59:02.063
- Maybe it doesn't work anymore!
- Wait! Wait! The book!

59:02.163 --> 59:04.156
What book?!

59:25.520 --> 59:28.180
Is this what you're looking for?

59:30.942 --> 59:33.803
If you kill me, your mistress
will never know the truth!

59:33.903 --> 59:35.687
Leave him!

59:38.616 --> 59:40.393
Don't trust him.

59:40.493 --> 59:43.904
Trust me, and I'll help you.
Choose, Countess.

59:45.665 --> 59:48.366
Let him speak.

59:51.546 --> 59:53.573
The chapter on blood sacrifices.

59:53.673 --> 59:55.950
- Yes, yes, I've read it.
- But not far enough, Captain...

59:56.050 --> 59:58.244
or you wouldn't have made
such a simple mistake.

59:58.344 --> 01:00:00.955
It states quite clearly,

01:00:01.055 --> 01:00:03.124
"For the restoration
of youth and beauty,

01:00:03.224 --> 01:00:06.920
only the blood of a
virgin may be used."

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:08.838
She was a common whore.

01:00:08.938 --> 01:00:10.889
- Oh, well.
- You fool!

01:00:12.191 --> 01:00:15.386
Thank you, Master Fabio,
for your scholarship on the matter.

01:00:15.486 --> 01:00:18.431
You shall not go unrewarded.

01:00:18.531 --> 01:00:21.434
Countess, if I can
assist at any time...

01:00:21.534 --> 01:00:24.854
You know, I find the whole
subject most enthralling!

01:00:24.954 --> 01:00:26.321
Thank you.

01:00:27.081 --> 01:00:31.827
Dobi, tomorrow you will
make good your mistake.

01:00:35.381 --> 01:00:38.083
A virgin, remember.

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:45.375
You're mad to trust him.

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:46.543
Why?

01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:48.795
Let him live in fear for his life.

01:00:48.895 --> 01:00:51.596
That way he will never betray us.

01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:12.868
Watch the Strong Woman bend iron!

01:01:28.643 --> 01:01:30.628
Sir! Sir! Sir!

01:01:30.728 --> 01:01:32.797
Sir, look at this one, sir.

01:01:32.897 --> 01:01:35.133
Feel the muscles of these arms.

01:01:35.233 --> 01:01:37.552
And, sir, these thighs.

01:01:37.652 --> 01:01:39.721
Why, they could pull the
weight of any carriage.

01:01:39.821 --> 01:01:42.724
And these breasts are
breasts of solid teak.

01:01:42.824 --> 01:01:45.977
Why, she can work longer
hours than anyone I know.

01:01:46.077 --> 01:01:49.147
A bargain, sir,
for a hundred koronas,

01:01:49.247 --> 01:01:54.993
and what is more, sir, I tell you,
she's willing, as well.

01:01:57.255 --> 01:01:58.455
No.

01:02:01.426 --> 01:02:02.952
- How much for this one?
- What?

01:02:03.052 --> 01:02:05.288
- This one here.
- Young Bertha?

01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:11.252
Oh, you can have her for free if
you take a goat for 25 koronas.

01:02:11.352 --> 01:02:13.046
She ever been with a man?

01:02:13.146 --> 01:02:15.798
Are you joking?

01:02:15.898 --> 01:02:19.636
Can you imagine anybody wanting to?

01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:20.803
I'll take her.

01:02:20.903 --> 01:02:22.388
Oh, come on, girl.

01:02:22.488 --> 01:02:24.265
Come on, up you go. Up you go.

01:02:24.365 --> 01:02:26.976
All right, go on, go on, go on.
Off with him.

01:02:27.076 --> 01:02:29.729
And now we have two more!

01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:33.073
Two more beauties!

01:03:20.421 --> 01:03:21.823
Countess.

01:03:21.923 --> 01:03:25.083
I'm sorry to disturb you.
I was looking for your daughter.

01:03:26.010 --> 01:03:29.038
She went out early to
gather some flowers.

01:03:29.138 --> 01:03:32.298
- Thank you.
- Oh, please stay.

01:03:33.559 --> 01:03:35.962
We have much to talk about, I think.

01:03:36.062 --> 01:03:37.887
Yes, indeed.

01:03:45.196 --> 01:03:47.932
I, um... I wanted to
speak to you before,

01:03:48.032 --> 01:03:50.351
but Ilona told me of your illness.

01:03:50.451 --> 01:03:52.729
I'm very happy to see you better.

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:55.356
I'm better today, but I am not well.

01:03:55.456 --> 01:03:57.775
The shock of the past
few days, you understand.

01:03:57.875 --> 01:03:59.402
Of course.

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:00.486
Ilona will have told you...

01:04:00.586 --> 01:04:03.698
That you are in love and
wish to be married.

01:04:03.798 --> 01:04:05.700
I sincerely hope that you approve.

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:08.786
It was always my late husband's wish

01:04:08.886 --> 01:04:11.873
that you, the son of
his dearest friend,

01:04:11.973 --> 01:04:13.840
should one day meet our daughter.

01:04:14.725 --> 01:04:17.962
Alas, he did not live to see it.

01:04:18.062 --> 01:04:21.931
However, you made
his widow very happy.

01:04:23.234 --> 01:04:25.219
I promise you, Countess,

01:04:25.319 --> 01:04:29.439
I shall honor and cherish Ilona
for the rest of my days.

01:04:30.449 --> 01:04:32.150
Come to me.

01:04:42.587 --> 01:04:45.413
My son.

01:05:33.387 --> 01:05:35.046
Oh!

01:06:11.676 --> 01:06:13.077
Psst! Psst!

01:06:13.177 --> 01:06:14.704
- Fabio, what's the matter?
- Shh!

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:16.455
I had to speak to you urgently.

01:06:16.555 --> 01:06:18.416
Have you seen the
Countess Ilona today?

01:06:18.516 --> 01:06:20.585
No. I was just going to look for her.

01:06:20.685 --> 01:06:22.670
Don't be disappointed
if you can't find her.

01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:24.255
What?!

01:06:24.355 --> 01:06:26.299
- I can't talk now.
- Fabio!

01:06:26.399 --> 01:06:29.225
- Meet me tonight after supper.
- What...

01:07:59.450 --> 01:08:01.025
Fabio?

01:08:53.504 --> 01:08:55.448
Fabio!

01:08:55.548 --> 01:08:57.575
Poor man.

01:08:57.675 --> 01:08:59.326
Brilliant scholar.

01:08:59.426 --> 01:09:01.711
Seeker of wisdom.

01:09:03.013 --> 01:09:06.876
He read all those books,
knew everything,

01:09:06.975 --> 01:09:10.553
but now... he knows nothing.

01:09:17.027 --> 01:09:19.020
You killed him.

01:09:20.113 --> 01:09:22.390
You killed him because
he knew something

01:09:22.491 --> 01:09:24.350
about you and the Countess.

01:09:24.451 --> 01:09:26.479
He was going to tell me,
but you stopped him!

01:09:26.578 --> 01:09:28.814
Now, listen to me, you young whelp!

01:09:28.913 --> 01:09:31.358
You came here, you took the stables.
All right, keep them.

01:09:31.457 --> 01:09:32.526
But the Countess is mine,
do you understand?

01:09:32.626 --> 01:09:33.944
I've waited for 20 years!

01:09:34.044 --> 01:09:36.871
Take her then! I don't want her!

01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:39.742
- It's Ilona I love.
- Ilona?

01:09:39.841 --> 01:09:41.202
Yes.

01:09:41.301 --> 01:09:42.578
Where is she?

01:09:42.678 --> 01:09:44.121
You want to see her, huh?

01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:47.500
- You want to see your bride?
- Yes!

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:52.254
So you shall, in all her glory.

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:54.806
Come with me!

01:10:11.707 --> 01:10:14.700
Julie? That you?

01:10:15.544 --> 01:10:18.788
Julie! Answer me.

01:10:27.348 --> 01:10:28.756
Oh, my God.

01:10:31.518 --> 01:10:33.594
Come, Julie.

01:10:36.482 --> 01:10:38.801
Ilona...

01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:40.393
where is your mother?

01:10:42.071 --> 01:10:44.014
The Countess Elisabeth, where is she?

01:10:44.114 --> 01:10:46.858
Imre...

01:10:48.994 --> 01:10:50.437
- Won't find her.
- Blood.

01:10:50.537 --> 01:10:51.522
Where is she?

01:10:51.622 --> 01:10:52.982
- Forget her.
- Huh?

01:10:53.082 --> 01:10:55.116
- Forget her.
- Where?

01:10:57.878 --> 01:10:59.071
You've killed her.

01:10:59.171 --> 01:11:03.492
No.

01:11:03.592 --> 01:11:06.043
I am Elisabeth.

01:11:06.804 --> 01:11:08.581
Look at me.

01:11:08.681 --> 01:11:10.791
My face.

01:11:10.891 --> 01:11:13.002
My body.

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:14.795
Hold me.

01:11:14.895 --> 01:11:16.922
No.

01:11:17.022 --> 01:11:18.674
Blood.

01:11:18.774 --> 01:11:19.800
Whose blood?

01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:21.218
No matter.

01:11:21.318 --> 01:11:24.138
I did it for you, my darling.

01:11:24.238 --> 01:11:26.891
To please you.

01:11:26.991 --> 01:11:28.649
I am Ilona.

01:11:29.576 --> 01:11:31.903
Don't touch me.

01:11:33.706 --> 01:11:36.650
You tried to be unfaithful
to me last night,

01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:39.535
and you couldn't even do that!

01:11:40.421 --> 01:11:42.239
You're obsessed with me.

01:11:42.339 --> 01:11:45.583
- Last night?
- You brought that whore in here.

01:11:46.510 --> 01:11:48.370
You think I didn't know?

01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:50.748
You think Dobi didn't tell me?

01:11:50.848 --> 01:11:53.716
- He's lying!
- Oh, is he?

01:11:58.355 --> 01:11:59.555
There.

01:12:04.445 --> 01:12:05.596
What have you done to her?

01:12:05.696 --> 01:12:06.805
Me?

01:12:06.905 --> 01:12:09.315
I have done nothing.

01:12:12.453 --> 01:12:14.195
You killed her.

01:12:22.129 --> 01:12:23.948
And there are witnesses.

01:12:24.048 --> 01:12:27.083
- Dobi?
- As many as I choose.

01:12:30.763 --> 01:12:32.505
My darling...

01:12:33.349 --> 01:12:35.716
you can't escape now.

01:12:39.271 --> 01:12:41.639
My son.

01:13:11.929 --> 01:13:14.415
Has the Countess been told?

01:13:14.515 --> 01:13:16.250
She took it badly.

01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:19.802
Master Fabio was much
loved by us all.

01:13:28.862 --> 01:13:30.938
Why did he do it?

01:13:33.117 --> 01:13:35.019
The Count's death.

01:13:35.119 --> 01:13:38.029
- They were very old friends.
- Yeah.

01:13:41.375 --> 01:13:43.485
But, of course...

01:13:43.585 --> 01:13:46.071
there is another possibility.

01:13:46.171 --> 01:13:47.698
Fortune card.

01:13:47.798 --> 01:13:49.992
You mean the gypsy girl?

01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:51.869
I found them in the
drawer of his desk.

01:13:51.969 --> 01:13:53.662
So you think he killed her

01:13:53.762 --> 01:13:57.291
and then hanged himself
from remorse or guilt.

01:13:57.391 --> 01:13:59.008
I see.

01:14:00.102 --> 01:14:02.713
What were his habits with women?
Did he ever confide in you?

01:14:02.813 --> 01:14:04.340
No. None of my business.

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.216
But I never saw him at the
Shepherd's Inn. Did you?

01:14:06.316 --> 01:14:09.310
No. Maybe better if we had.
At least it's healthy.

01:14:10.195 --> 01:14:12.139
Of course, he could have
stumbled upon the real killer

01:14:12.239 --> 01:14:14.690
who then silenced him.

01:14:15.742 --> 01:14:18.896
Too fanciful. Yeah.

01:14:18.996 --> 01:14:20.689
Well, anyway, my men are
searching the castle now,

01:14:20.789 --> 01:14:23.074
so we... we should learn something.

01:14:33.385 --> 01:14:34.953
Where do you think you're going?!

01:14:35.053 --> 01:14:37.289
I'm not staying here.

01:14:37.389 --> 01:14:39.416
There's a curse on this place!

01:14:39.516 --> 01:14:42.718
You come back! And your brat!

01:14:43.437 --> 01:14:47.515
Nobody leaves without
my permission! Understood?

01:14:48.692 --> 01:14:51.887
Where is she? Have you found her?
Have you found my little one?

01:14:51.987 --> 01:14:53.472
Stop worrying.

01:14:53.572 --> 01:14:56.266
There's nothing to connect your
daughter and the gypsy girl.

01:14:56.366 --> 01:14:58.060
Sergeant! Sergeant! Here!

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:00.111
What? Where?

01:15:03.582 --> 01:15:05.609
- Sergeant! Here!
- What is it? What?

01:15:05.709 --> 01:15:07.027
What is it, man?

01:15:07.127 --> 01:15:09.696
Found someone?

01:15:09.796 --> 01:15:11.789
What's going on?

01:15:15.552 --> 01:15:18.497
No!

01:15:18.597 --> 01:15:22.174
No! Teri!

01:15:34.196 --> 01:15:36.223
One of them was poor Ziza.

01:15:36.323 --> 01:15:39.309
- So I've been told.
- Mm.

01:15:39.409 --> 01:15:40.853
Well, are they all present?

01:15:40.953 --> 01:15:42.695
Take your choice.

01:15:57.344 --> 01:16:01.373
Well, you must have problems if you
need these villains for servants.

01:16:01.473 --> 01:16:03.584
Well, we can't pick and choose.
The war took the best.

01:16:03.684 --> 01:16:06.510
Sergeant, take these men to the
county house for questioning.

01:16:09.231 --> 01:16:10.799
And these two.

01:16:10.899 --> 01:16:12.092
No!

01:16:12.192 --> 01:16:14.560
No!

01:16:15.487 --> 01:16:17.271
The rest can stay.

01:16:18.574 --> 01:16:21.894
Now, I want all the women...
young and old...

01:16:21.994 --> 01:16:23.903
to leave the castle within the hour.

01:16:24.913 --> 01:16:26.690
All right, all right!
Don't panic, I say!

01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:29.610
You will be allowed to return as
soon as the matter is settled.

01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:31.069
Now, come on. Move yourselves.

01:16:31.169 --> 01:16:33.989
Come along. Will you please move?

01:16:34.089 --> 01:16:36.867
Go on. Start packing. Hurry along.

01:16:36.967 --> 01:16:39.335
Excuse me, Captain Balogh.

01:16:41.346 --> 01:16:43.999
You mean to include my mother and me?

01:16:44.099 --> 01:16:45.459
Oh, no, no, no, Countess.
Please forgive me.

01:16:45.559 --> 01:16:48.337
I-I'm sure you'll be perfectly safe
with Captain Dobi and your fiancé,

01:16:48.437 --> 01:16:50.756
but they couldn't be
responsible for everyone,

01:16:50.856 --> 01:16:54.134
and it is just possible the killer
may still be in hiding somewhere.

01:16:54.234 --> 01:16:56.435
Stay close to her.

01:17:01.241 --> 01:17:02.309
I don't know where we're going.

01:17:02.409 --> 01:17:04.186
Why did...

01:17:04.286 --> 01:17:07.446
Why did they pick me?
I've been here so long.

01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:23.170
Check.

01:17:27.517 --> 01:17:29.343
You're in check.

01:17:34.858 --> 01:17:38.136
Oh, come on, what are
you so gloomy about?

01:17:38.236 --> 01:17:39.930
Don't you see what'll happen?

01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:43.767
She'll grow old, starved of
her little virgin girls,

01:17:43.867 --> 01:17:46.061
and she'll be mine.

01:17:46.161 --> 01:17:47.736
And you can clear out.

01:17:48.413 --> 01:17:50.190
That's what you want, isn't it?

01:17:50.290 --> 01:17:51.817
The Countess wants to see you.

01:17:51.917 --> 01:17:53.868
- Which one of us?
- You, Captain.

01:18:06.223 --> 01:18:08.841
You knew about it from the beginning.

01:18:11.061 --> 01:18:12.421
How could you say nothing?

01:18:12.521 --> 01:18:14.590
I wanted to see her happy.

01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:16.800
I brought her little
one into the world.

01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:18.309
Ilona?

01:18:19.277 --> 01:18:20.345
The real Ilona?

01:18:20.445 --> 01:18:21.597
Oh-ho!

01:18:21.697 --> 01:18:24.182
She was so beautiful.

01:18:24.282 --> 01:18:28.110
I used to tell her stories,
sing her to sleep.

01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:30.856
But they had to send her away.

01:18:30.956 --> 01:18:33.400
Why didn't she come back?

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:35.068
They said she was on the way.

01:18:35.168 --> 01:18:37.738
It was the flood that stopped her.

01:18:37.838 --> 01:18:39.448
Listen, Julie!

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:40.741
You know as well as I

01:18:40.841 --> 01:18:43.493
Captain Balogh won't
find the murderer.

01:18:43.593 --> 01:18:45.419
That means we're imprisoned here!

01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:48.081
Trapped forever.

01:18:48.181 --> 01:18:50.417
But I'm not imprisoned.

01:18:50.517 --> 01:18:52.468
This is my home.

01:19:01.611 --> 01:19:04.939
- Oh, please.
- What do you want of me?

01:19:06.158 --> 01:19:08.268
I shan't go to sleep tonight,

01:19:08.368 --> 01:19:11.897
thinking that it might
happen again anytime.

01:19:11.997 --> 01:19:14.858
Couldn't we have someone
ready at the castle?

01:19:14.958 --> 01:19:19.863
How can I get anyone in with
the bailiffs at the gate?

01:19:19.963 --> 01:19:21.907
Oh, but you can outwit them.

01:19:22.007 --> 01:19:25.542
You can do anything. Anything.

01:19:28.805 --> 01:19:30.878
Very well.

01:19:34.278 --> 01:19:36.278
Very well.

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:40.634
Dobi...

01:19:40.734 --> 01:19:43.894
you will bring someone here tonight?

01:19:48.158 --> 01:19:51.944
She'll be ready when you need her.

01:20:23.318 --> 01:20:25.470
Good night, Countess.

01:20:25.570 --> 01:20:28.105
- Julie.
- My dear?

01:20:30.951 --> 01:20:32.644
Julie, Captain Dobi
promised to bring me

01:20:32.744 --> 01:20:34.688
a girl from the village,

01:20:34.788 --> 01:20:37.607
but I fear he may have tricked me.

01:20:37.707 --> 01:20:40.068
He's jealous of my beauty.

01:20:40.168 --> 01:20:41.611
And my love for Imre.

01:20:41.711 --> 01:20:43.488
What do you want me to do?

01:20:43.588 --> 01:20:48.285
Search the castle, every room,
and if you find her, don't disturb her.

01:20:48.385 --> 01:20:51.538
Just to put my mind at rest.

01:20:51.638 --> 01:20:53.589
Go now! Hurry!

01:21:22.752 --> 01:21:24.620
Looking for someone?

01:21:30.218 --> 01:21:32.996
The Countess is anxious.

01:21:33.096 --> 01:21:34.539
She's here.

01:21:34.639 --> 01:21:36.840
The girl's ready.

01:21:41.938 --> 01:21:43.597
Good night, Julie.

01:22:39.621 --> 01:22:40.821
Nanny?

01:22:43.041 --> 01:22:44.491
Is it you, Nanny?

01:22:46.044 --> 01:22:48.662
Oh...

01:22:49.422 --> 01:22:51.623
My little one.

01:22:53.635 --> 01:22:56.162
You remember me?

01:22:56.262 --> 01:22:57.914
Oh, yes.

01:22:58.014 --> 01:23:01.216
I remember you.

01:23:02.185 --> 01:23:04.629
My child.

01:23:04.729 --> 01:23:06.847
My baby!

01:23:09.025 --> 01:23:11.636
Nanny, please help me.

01:23:11.736 --> 01:23:13.805
I don't know what's happened to me.

01:23:13.905 --> 01:23:15.432
My father is dead.

01:23:15.532 --> 01:23:17.017
- Shh...
- I haven't seen my mother.

01:23:17.117 --> 01:23:20.402
You must be patient, my little one.

01:23:26.668 --> 01:23:29.070
They say it's an ill omen

01:23:29.170 --> 01:23:32.789
that we should see each other on
the morning of our wedding day.

01:23:33.925 --> 01:23:36.453
But I'm not superstitious.

01:23:36.553 --> 01:23:38.587
Are you, my darling?

01:23:48.982 --> 01:23:50.926
Oh, I'm so happy!

01:23:51.026 --> 01:23:56.181
Dobi, I've decided to overrule Captain
Balogh's orders just for today.

01:23:56.281 --> 01:23:59.059
I want everyone to share my happiness

01:23:59.159 --> 01:24:01.693
and attend the ceremony.

01:24:02.328 --> 01:24:04.940
All the women servants
and the tradespeople

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:06.650
and even our friendly bailiffs.

01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:08.777
And drinks for everyone.

01:24:08.877 --> 01:24:10.654
Will you make the
arrangements, please?

01:24:10.754 --> 01:24:13.288
And your...

01:24:14.299 --> 01:24:15.992
mother...

01:24:16.092 --> 01:24:18.203
will she be attending?

01:24:18.303 --> 01:24:21.790
Sadly, no.
She's really quite ill today.

01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:23.548
I am most concerned.

01:24:31.066 --> 01:24:32.842
Julie, will you,
when you're finished,

01:24:32.942 --> 01:24:36.311
help me with my
wedding dress, please?

01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:45.772
Master Imre.

01:24:45.872 --> 01:24:47.899
Master Imre?

01:24:47.999 --> 01:24:50.402
Will you please come with me?

01:24:50.502 --> 01:24:52.779
There's someone you have to meet.

01:24:52.879 --> 01:24:54.656
Please.

01:24:54.756 --> 01:24:56.581
Hurry.

01:25:06.726 --> 01:25:08.336
Don't be afraid, my love.

01:25:08.436 --> 01:25:10.880
This is Imre Toth. He's visiting us.

01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:15.142
Master Imre, Master Imre,
this is Countess Ilona.

01:25:15.944 --> 01:25:17.644
Ah.

01:25:19.072 --> 01:25:20.932
Your name is familiar to me.

01:25:21.032 --> 01:25:22.726
My father was General Toth.

01:25:22.826 --> 01:25:25.603
Of course. My father
spoke of him in letters.

01:25:25.703 --> 01:25:26.938
He also spoke of you.

01:25:27.038 --> 01:25:29.899
Yes, I believe it was his wish
that we should one day meet.

01:25:29.999 --> 01:25:32.277
- Julie?
- Oh, Master Imre, we must go.

01:25:32.377 --> 01:25:34.696
- Who is it?
- Come. Quickly.

01:25:34.796 --> 01:25:36.788
We'll come back.

01:25:42.762 --> 01:25:46.923
Dobi brought her for the Countess.
She must escape.

01:25:48.476 --> 01:25:50.052
Wait.

01:25:52.939 --> 01:25:55.592
You must lead her away
during the ceremony.

01:25:55.692 --> 01:25:58.553
No one will notice your absence.
Take her to the stables.

01:25:58.653 --> 01:26:00.346
- You'll meet us there?
- I cannot.

01:26:00.446 --> 01:26:03.016
- But, Master Imre...
- You know I cannot.

01:26:03.116 --> 01:26:04.142
God knows I wish it,

01:26:04.242 --> 01:26:07.353
but I have witnessed so much blood,
my very being reeks of it.

01:26:07.453 --> 01:26:09.773
But you are innocent as she is.

01:26:09.873 --> 01:26:11.191
You must go together.

01:26:11.291 --> 01:26:14.194
- Together?
- Julie, I'm waiting.

01:26:14.294 --> 01:26:17.614
- Take her.
- And raise false hopes to break them?

01:26:17.714 --> 01:26:20.867
No. It's unthinkable.
You must save her.

01:26:20.967 --> 01:26:24.086
Go now, quickly,
before we are discovered.

01:26:35.106 --> 01:26:36.883
Oh, please tell me what's happening.

01:26:36.983 --> 01:26:39.594
Foolish Nanny says I should
be patient, but how can I be?

01:26:39.694 --> 01:26:41.262
- She tells me nothing.
- Countess, you don't know.

01:26:41.362 --> 01:26:43.389
She's so stubborn.
She makes me quite angry.

01:26:43.489 --> 01:26:45.600
Your life is in grave danger.

01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:47.143
From whom?

01:26:47.243 --> 01:26:49.270
I cannot tell you,
but please trust me.

01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:52.190
You must leave at once.

01:26:52.290 --> 01:26:54.199
Leave my home?

01:26:56.252 --> 01:26:59.114
But I want to see my father's grave.

01:26:59.214 --> 01:27:01.699
And my mother, I must speak with her.

01:27:01.799 --> 01:27:03.743
I'm afraid that is not possible.

01:27:03.843 --> 01:27:05.537
Why?

01:27:05.637 --> 01:27:07.504
Tell me.

01:27:11.851 --> 01:27:14.003
Please, I beg you,
do not argue with me.

01:27:14.103 --> 01:27:17.757
In a short while, Julie will
take you to the stable.

01:27:17.857 --> 01:27:20.009
Now, do not speak to anyone.

01:27:20.109 --> 01:27:22.303
But I will say I am
the Countess Ilona.

01:27:22.403 --> 01:27:24.180
You will not be believed.

01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:26.850
Take a horse and ride with
haste to the county house.

01:27:26.950 --> 01:27:28.393
Wait there for Captain Balogh.

01:27:28.493 --> 01:27:32.147
When he comes,
tell him of your misfortunes.

01:27:32.247 --> 01:27:33.947
Will you not come with me?

01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:37.527
I fear to go alone.

01:27:37.627 --> 01:27:38.945
You must not fear.

01:27:39.045 --> 01:27:41.621
Please come with me.

01:27:44.759 --> 01:27:46.334
I'll meet you at the stables.

01:27:47.011 --> 01:27:48.329
You will not fail me?

01:27:48.429 --> 01:27:50.130
No.

01:27:53.726 --> 01:27:55.594
I must go now.

01:27:57.480 --> 01:27:59.890
Do everything that Julie tells you.

01:29:44.003 --> 01:29:46.288
Shh.

01:29:57.058 --> 01:29:58.251
Come, child.

01:29:58.351 --> 01:29:59.544
No.

01:29:59.644 --> 01:30:01.421
Listen, Nanny. I can hear a priest.

01:30:01.521 --> 01:30:03.047
What's happening?

01:30:03.147 --> 01:30:05.174
It's no concern of yours, my love.

01:30:05.274 --> 01:30:06.384
We must hurry.

01:30:06.484 --> 01:30:08.094
No, leave me.

01:30:08.194 --> 01:30:10.763
I want to know. I must know.

01:30:10.863 --> 01:30:12.063
No.

01:30:38.766 --> 01:30:41.843
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:31:01.497 --> 01:31:03.691
Where is she?

01:31:03.791 --> 01:31:06.826
Where is she?

01:31:09.964 --> 01:31:12.533
- Where is she?!
- Mother?

01:31:12.633 --> 01:31:15.877
- Don't touch her!
- Mother?

01:31:53.633 --> 01:31:55.368
- The hangman...
- It's the hangman.

01:31:55.468 --> 01:31:57.578
- He's come for the Countess.
- The woman.

01:31:57.678 --> 01:31:59.372
- The hangman.
- The devil woman.

01:31:59.472 --> 01:32:01.791
- Devil woman.
- They'll kill her.

01:32:01.891 --> 01:32:04.001
They'll kill her.

01:32:04.101 --> 01:32:05.545
Devil woman.

01:32:05.645 --> 01:32:08.005
- The devil woman.
- The devil woman.

01:32:08.105 --> 01:32:10.675
Devil woman.

01:32:10.775 --> 01:32:13.768
Countess Dracula.

01:32:16.697 --> 01:32:18.898
The devil woman.

01:32:20.117 --> 01:32:23.328
Countess Dracula.

01:32:23.329 --> 01:32:28.116
- Devil woman.
- Countess.
