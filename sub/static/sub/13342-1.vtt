01:22.792 --> 01:24.375
Tad:
To our daughter Hannah...

01:24.375 --> 01:26.333
Loreen:
Let's wait until
he gets here.

01:26.333 --> 01:30.333
I can't wait.
I'm too overwhelmed
with emotion.

01:30.333 --> 01:31.792
So sweet, Daddy.

01:31.792 --> 01:34.000
To our daughter
Hannah.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.834
Slow to grow,
but, oh...

01:37.834 --> 01:40.208
how beautiful
is the blossom.

01:40.208 --> 01:41.458
( laughs )

01:41.458 --> 01:45.000
Tad:
We're so very proud
of your achievements,

01:45.000 --> 01:48.041
your artistry,
and your warm, open heart.

01:48.041 --> 01:50.000
- ( clicks tongue )
- Thank you.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.583
Hey, can I get some fries
when you get a chance?

01:51.583 --> 01:53.417
- Fries, please?
- You don't need any fries.

01:53.417 --> 01:56.750
I'll share.
It's Friday, so...

01:56.750 --> 01:58.166
( laughs )

01:58.166 --> 02:01.166
Uh, to our daughter
Hannah Helene...

02:01.166 --> 02:02.417
That is me.

02:02.417 --> 02:04.792
...who smiled when she first
came out of the womb.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.792
- And then sneezed.
- And then sneezed.

02:06.792 --> 02:08.333
( laughing )
That's right, you sneezed.

02:08.333 --> 02:12.083
- No, I didn't!
- Loreen: Yes, you sneezed
one great big sneeze.

02:12.083 --> 02:14.458
"I have allergies."

02:14.458 --> 02:17.041
Well, I want to toast
both of you

02:17.041 --> 02:20.959
for the massive amounts
of love and support that
you have shown me

02:20.959 --> 02:23.917
in the four years
since I graduated
from college.

02:23.917 --> 02:26.000
And I just want to say that
even in the moments

02:26.000 --> 02:29.208
when, superficially,
it didn't seem like
you were supporting me

02:29.208 --> 02:32.208
and it seemed like
you were criticizing
my choices

02:32.208 --> 02:33.667
and doubting my talent,

02:33.667 --> 02:36.041
I know that you were
supporting me in your own way.

02:36.041 --> 02:39.000
- So, that means a lot.
- Thanks, sweetie.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.083
- I'm so sorry I'm late.
- Hey, Adam!

02:41.083 --> 02:42.542
- Hey, big guy.
- How was your audition?

02:42.542 --> 02:46.750
Fuckin' shitty.
Apparently they meant more
like Tour de France biker.

02:46.750 --> 02:49.250
I'm gonna rip my agent
a new eyehole.

02:49.250 --> 02:50.417
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:50.417 --> 02:52.750
Hannah:
He has a really,
really great new agent.

02:52.750 --> 02:56.166
She is now representing him
along with many other
great actors

02:56.166 --> 02:58.250
like Norman Reedus
from "The Walking Dead."

02:58.250 --> 02:59.583
She just can't
read English.

02:59.583 --> 03:01.375
You know Norman Reedus?

03:01.375 --> 03:03.250
Loreen:
Tad was just
toasting Hannah.

03:03.250 --> 03:05.041
We want her to know
how proud we are

03:05.041 --> 03:08.083
of this adventure
she's embarking on.

03:08.083 --> 03:09.417
To Hannah.

03:09.417 --> 03:10.875
Yes.

03:10.875 --> 03:15.250
Taking the next step
in a series of random steps.

03:15.250 --> 03:17.708
How strange our journey is
through life, you know?

03:17.708 --> 03:19.708
We try and inject it
with meaning,

03:19.708 --> 03:23.291
but at the end of the day
all we have are days...

03:25.834 --> 03:28.417
marching on.

03:28.417 --> 03:30.708
- That's very cool, Adam.
- Cool?

03:32.041 --> 03:33.792
Congratulations
and mazel tov.

03:33.792 --> 03:35.041
To Iowa.

03:35.041 --> 03:38.583
- ( wind howling )
- ( thunder crashing )

03:40.250 --> 03:41.959
( music playing )

03:41.959 --> 03:44.375
Woman's voice:
Sometimes it feels
like nothing,

03:44.375 --> 03:45.834
a total numbness,

03:45.834 --> 03:48.125
and sometimes it feels like
the coldest rain

03:48.125 --> 03:51.834
is going to keep falling down
on you forever.

03:51.834 --> 03:53.583
Living your life
with depression

03:53.583 --> 03:56.000
is like trying to walk
a mile in mud.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
We all need a little help
sometimes to change
the weather.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.792
Torpica,

04:01.792 --> 04:04.750
because you deserve
the sun.

04:04.750 --> 04:07.417
Ask your doctor if Torpica
is right for you.

04:07.417 --> 04:09.917
- Side effects may include--
- ( shuts TV off )

04:12.500 --> 04:14.750
Okay, you're really good.

04:18.291 --> 04:21.959
- What?
- It's fuckin' heinous!

04:21.959 --> 04:24.834
They cut shit out
that made it a cohesive story.

04:24.834 --> 04:27.834
Yeah, I mean,
it's a commercial,
but you  were really good.

04:27.834 --> 04:29.333
( groans )

04:29.333 --> 04:32.792
Can't believe
I fuckin' shaved
for that shit!

04:32.792 --> 04:34.917
Okay, listen.
It was a job, okay?

04:34.917 --> 04:37.333
And no one is even gonna
remember this in two months.

04:37.333 --> 04:39.333
Someone already came up to me
in the subway and was like,

04:39.333 --> 04:41.458
"Hey, I couldn't get
my dick hard on Torpica."

04:41.458 --> 04:43.667
I'm sorry,
but people have to work.

04:43.667 --> 04:45.542
You took a job.
It's fine.

04:45.542 --> 04:47.542
( groans )

04:47.542 --> 04:49.959
I'm sorry.
( kisses )

04:49.959 --> 04:53.875
And I'm sorry I can't tell you
exactly what weekend I'm coming
home to visit, okay?

04:53.875 --> 04:55.667
That's okay.

04:57.583 --> 04:58.792
I mean,
I know it's okay.

04:58.792 --> 05:01.000
I just feel like
the whole separation thing

05:01.000 --> 05:04.792
would be easier
if we, you know,
had a clear-cut plan.

05:06.500 --> 05:10.250
No, it's fine.
With cell phones
and modern communication,

05:10.250 --> 05:12.083
we're gonna talk,
like, 10 times tomorrow.

05:12.083 --> 05:14.041
It's all good.
It's all fluid.
We'll take it day by day.

05:14.041 --> 05:16.458
There's no need
to create some drama.

05:19.041 --> 05:20.417
Okay.

05:20.417 --> 05:21.959
( music playing )

05:21.959 --> 05:24.625
( moaning )

05:26.542 --> 05:29.583
Oh, my God,
that's so good.

05:29.583 --> 05:31.792
Oh, my God.

05:31.792 --> 05:34.417
Oh, I love that.

05:34.417 --> 05:36.083
I love you, too.

05:37.250 --> 05:39.208
( both moaning )

05:41.750 --> 05:43.333
All right,
you are all set.

05:43.333 --> 05:46.250
You're gonna be getting
your diploma in the mail
in about six to eight weeks.

05:46.250 --> 05:49.083
- Thank you.
- Okay, smile, my honey.

05:50.375 --> 05:51.917
( shutter clicks )

05:51.917 --> 05:55.041
- Well, you missed it.
- I missed it?
I missed what?

05:55.041 --> 05:56.917
No, you didn't--
you didn't miss anything.
There's nothing to miss.

05:56.917 --> 05:58.166
I don't get my diploma
for, like, a month.

05:58.166 --> 05:59.500
Which address
did you give them, Shoshy?

05:59.500 --> 06:00.959
I think
she gave them mine.

06:00.959 --> 06:03.083
Woman:
Uh, Mel Shapiro?

06:03.083 --> 06:05.792
- We're both Mel Shapiro.
- It's Melvin and Melanie.

06:05.792 --> 06:07.959
Mel Shapiro,
25 Eden Manor Way.

06:07.959 --> 06:09.708
I told you.
She gave them mine.

06:09.708 --> 06:12.625
- Well, can we get two copies?
Can we get two copies?
- We don't need two copies.

06:12.625 --> 06:14.208
Why did you want
your father to get it first?

06:14.208 --> 06:15.583
- Be honest with me.
- I just--

06:15.583 --> 06:17.166
- Don't bullshit me.
- I'm not bullshitting.

06:17.166 --> 06:19.417
It's just where the bills go,
so I just assumed that
he should get it.

06:19.417 --> 06:22.458
Excuse me, I live in
a gated community and I have
very responsible security

06:22.458 --> 06:24.208
which will make sure
that it won't be misplaced.

06:24.208 --> 06:27.208
- Well, I have Kevin
and he works from home.
- Kevin works?

06:27.208 --> 06:28.917
Melanie:
Yeah, I don't have
to defend him to you.

06:28.917 --> 06:31.458
I have never mishandled
a package since I married him
and that is a fact.

06:31.458 --> 06:33.542
Okay, seriously, you guys,
there's nothing special
about today.

06:33.542 --> 06:34.625
I'm not even walking
in the processional

06:34.625 --> 06:35.875
or wearing a hat,
so can we please just go?

06:35.875 --> 06:37.792
Melanie:
Will you get a picture
of us three, please?

06:37.792 --> 06:38.917
Why would
you want that?

06:38.917 --> 06:40.458
It's not for me,
it's for Shoshy.

06:40.458 --> 06:42.417
- She would like it.
- I don't-- I don't want it.

06:42.417 --> 06:44.125
Why don't you want it?
You're out of your mind!

06:44.125 --> 06:46.417
You're gonna look back
on this moment and you're
gonna regret it

06:46.417 --> 06:48.458
because it's a good thing
to document, to remember
you did something.

06:48.458 --> 06:50.458
- She doesn't want a picture.
- She accomplished something.

06:50.458 --> 06:52.375
I worked hard
and I paid for this.

07:01.166 --> 07:03.417
Beedie!

07:03.417 --> 07:05.750
Krasner's gonna be fine.

07:05.750 --> 07:09.750
He swallowed a bobby pin,
which affected his gallbladder.

07:09.750 --> 07:11.625
Um, I think that's
what they said.

07:11.625 --> 07:13.959
Do you know I got
enough pastrami

07:13.959 --> 07:16.750
to feed all
of fucking Brighton Beach?

07:16.750 --> 07:19.375
Where you at, thug?

07:22.708 --> 07:24.542
Oh, physical therapist.

07:24.542 --> 07:26.166
You aren't supposed
to be here till 6:00.

07:26.166 --> 07:28.333
She still has to eat
and have lunch.

07:28.333 --> 07:29.834
No.

07:29.834 --> 07:31.625
I'm her daughter.

07:31.625 --> 07:34.333
Oh, my God.
Uh, Rickie, right?

07:34.333 --> 07:36.667
Oh, my God.
I've heard so much about you.

07:36.667 --> 07:38.125
How was Argentina?

07:38.125 --> 07:40.875
- I know what happened, dumbass.
- What are you talking about?

07:40.875 --> 07:43.750
She had to have
her stomach pumped,
all right?

07:43.750 --> 07:46.542
You lied to the police
and she could've died.

07:46.542 --> 07:48.208
Where is Beedie?

07:48.208 --> 07:49.875
She's getting packed, okay?

07:49.875 --> 07:52.291
She's coming to live with me
in Connecticut.

07:52.291 --> 07:55.333
And she doesn't want me
to call the police,
so I won't,

07:55.333 --> 07:59.291
but what you did
was "unconscible,"
all right?

07:59.291 --> 08:02.500
"Unconscible."
It was "unconscible."

08:02.500 --> 08:05.792
I can't say that word.
What you did fucking sucked.

08:05.792 --> 08:07.875
You really are
a piece of shit.

08:07.875 --> 08:10.792
I did what
she asked me to do.

08:10.792 --> 08:12.417
Fuck you.

08:12.417 --> 08:13.959
You really need
to figure some shit out.

08:13.959 --> 08:15.875
- No, can you just
give me one second?
- Honestly.

08:15.875 --> 08:18.250
Please let me
just gather my thoughts.
I'm like--

08:18.250 --> 08:19.834
You know,
I'm not that much
older than you

08:19.834 --> 08:21.291
and all my friends
have it together.

08:21.291 --> 08:24.458
But every time I meet
someone five or more years
younger than me,

08:24.458 --> 08:26.542
they are a complete asshole.

08:26.542 --> 08:29.417
Is it because you were
told you were special
one too many times

08:29.417 --> 08:31.250
and, what,
you believed it?

08:31.250 --> 08:33.500
Because when
my generation

08:33.500 --> 08:36.125
and every generation before me
were called special,

08:36.125 --> 08:39.082
we were smart enough to know
it meant that we were stupid,

08:39.082 --> 08:41.875
so it made us work
that much harder to stop
being stupid.

08:41.875 --> 08:44.082
Beedie:
I'm ready to go now.

08:44.082 --> 08:48.083
Beedie, what is going on?

08:48.083 --> 08:49.625
Please don't go.

08:49.625 --> 08:53.667
Jess, we got ourselves
into far too much trouble.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.417
What do you mean?

08:55.417 --> 08:58.792
Well, we practically
robbed a bank.

08:58.792 --> 09:03.000
We did, pretty much.
We could have, at least.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.834
Best friends reunited.

09:04.834 --> 09:06.458
Jessa:
Please listen to me.

09:06.458 --> 09:09.458
You cannot go
to Connecticut.

09:09.458 --> 09:12.083
You will die there.

09:12.083 --> 09:14.417
I have to go.

09:17.792 --> 09:19.291
You're so special.

09:19.291 --> 09:21.583
You're so full
of contradictions.

09:21.583 --> 09:24.333
And you're so beautiful
and then you're so ugly.

09:24.333 --> 09:25.542
Yeah, thanks.

09:25.542 --> 09:28.333
No, I just adore you.
You just--

09:29.500 --> 09:32.417
you really
took care of me.

09:33.792 --> 09:35.250
I tried.

09:35.250 --> 09:38.083
- You're an old bitch
sometimes, but you--
- Will you shut up?

09:38.083 --> 09:41.959
- At least I tried.
- I tried.

09:41.959 --> 09:44.166
You beautiful thing.

09:44.166 --> 09:49.000
Tell me you love me
more than her.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.792
( laughing )

09:53.834 --> 09:58.500
I love you
more than her.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.959
( laughs )

10:00.959 --> 10:02.458
( kisses )

10:02.458 --> 10:05.125
Is that
really heavy, baby?

10:05.125 --> 10:08.375
- Yeah.
- Clerk: Let me
help you with that.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.834
I cannot believe
we got that done so early.

10:10.834 --> 10:13.708
( laughs )
It's not early.
You leave tomorrow.

10:13.708 --> 10:15.333
Yeah, but I don't
usually, like, pack.

10:15.333 --> 10:17.667
I usually leave my crap
in a pile and just hope

10:17.667 --> 10:20.125
it somehow makes it
to where I'm going.

10:20.125 --> 10:24.250
I'm sorry that we have to go
to this Marnie-Desi gig
or whatever horror show.

10:24.250 --> 10:26.500
All time with you
is great.

10:27.667 --> 10:30.750
No piece of time
is more valuable
than another.

10:30.750 --> 10:33.458
We are here together
right now.

10:33.458 --> 10:35.375
Okay.

10:39.708 --> 10:42.041
( chatter )

10:42.041 --> 10:44.208
- The girl in the store said--
- That's what you do.

10:44.208 --> 10:46.542
Okay, well, I have
a little powder
if you need to--

10:46.542 --> 10:48.250
I don't-- we have
different color faces.

10:48.250 --> 10:49.500
You know, they have
these pieces now

10:49.500 --> 10:51.083
you can put in
just to fluff it up.

10:51.083 --> 10:53.000
I don't need any extra hair.
I have plenty of hair.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.041
Hi!

10:54.041 --> 10:58.041
Hannah!
Oh, what's up?

10:58.041 --> 11:00.708
Hey, Shosh.
How's it goin'?

11:00.708 --> 11:02.375
- Hi!
- Hi!

11:02.375 --> 11:03.708
- How are you?
- Good.

11:03.708 --> 11:06.625
I can never get this
where I want it to be.

11:06.625 --> 11:09.583
- Hey.
- Oh, I can-- hey.

11:09.583 --> 11:10.708
Amour.

11:10.708 --> 11:12.834
- Hi.
- Hey.

11:15.250 --> 11:16.583
Mm.

11:16.583 --> 11:18.083
Listen, I'm gonna run
and pee before we start.

11:18.083 --> 11:20.792
I got us a table
right there.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.959
Hey, Clementine.

11:24.959 --> 11:26.542
Hey, Marnie.

11:26.542 --> 11:29.583
Um, listen, I feel
like I need--

11:29.583 --> 11:31.917
No, no, me first,
please.

11:31.917 --> 11:33.750
Okay.

11:33.750 --> 11:35.417
I'm so sorry.

11:35.417 --> 11:38.959
I was possessed
talking to you like that.

11:38.959 --> 11:40.583
I'm not even
a jealous person.

11:40.583 --> 11:42.708
I think that I was
just maybe threatened

11:42.708 --> 11:45.750
by the musical connection
you guys share

11:45.750 --> 11:48.583
and scared that I would
lose him, which is crazy.

11:48.583 --> 11:51.875
Yeah, well, I'm sorry
that I gave you

11:51.875 --> 11:55.000
the impression that I was
even almost remotely capable

11:55.000 --> 11:56.625
of doing something
like that.

11:56.625 --> 11:59.875
Anyway, thank you
for saying that.

11:59.875 --> 12:01.792
Well, break a leg, lady.

12:01.792 --> 12:03.291
Oh, thanks, girl.

12:03.291 --> 12:05.000
So, see you after.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.792
Sure will.

12:06.792 --> 12:09.166
( sighs )

12:09.166 --> 12:11.291
- Those your underwear?
- This is fascinating.

12:11.291 --> 12:12.959
Oh, yeah, I always
try to keep clean.

12:12.959 --> 12:15.834
You're competing with guys
who are a completely different
physical type than you.

12:15.834 --> 12:19.333
Like, you're auditioning
with, like, Zachary Quinto

12:19.333 --> 12:20.667
or Armie Hammer, even.

12:20.667 --> 12:23.041
Well, I don't
really know names,
but, yeah, definitely.

12:23.041 --> 12:24.417
It's intense.

12:24.417 --> 12:26.125
It's the first time
I ever looked at myself
in the mirror

12:26.125 --> 12:28.291
and maybe wished
something was different.

12:28.291 --> 12:30.542
Not my dick or anything,
but, like, my forehead.

12:30.542 --> 12:31.834
Yeah, yeah, totally.

12:31.834 --> 12:34.000
Yo, necrophiliacs.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.583
Hey, what's up?

12:35.583 --> 12:37.208
Hi.

12:37.208 --> 12:38.834
Aunt Mel and Uncle Mel
say hi.

12:38.834 --> 12:41.166
Both of my parents
are named Mel.

12:41.166 --> 12:43.041
It's the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

12:43.041 --> 12:45.000
And it was, like,
the first thing that
ever happened to me.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.959
Let me take a picture.
One sec.

12:46.959 --> 12:48.667
- Okay. Oh, wait.
- ( shutter clicks )

12:48.667 --> 12:50.834
I was trying to reach you,
like, all of yesterday.

12:50.834 --> 12:52.750
- Oh, yeah?
- Hold on.

12:52.750 --> 12:54.834
Yeah, 'cause I'm leaving
tomorrow and I was thinking
you might wanna,

12:54.834 --> 12:56.291
I don't know,
hang out.

12:56.291 --> 12:59.000
- Mm, yeah, maybe.
- ( laughs ) So cute.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.375
But it would have had
to happen already because
I'm leaving tomorrow.

13:02.375 --> 13:04.375
Mm, darn.

13:05.834 --> 13:08.166
I'm gonna pee.

13:08.166 --> 13:09.667
Excuse me.

13:10.750 --> 13:12.583
You made the choice
you need to survive.

13:12.583 --> 13:15.083
You made the choice
you need to survive.

13:15.083 --> 13:17.667
Everyone's path
will unwind just right.

13:17.667 --> 13:21.750
Everyone's path
will unwind-- hey.

13:21.750 --> 13:23.959
- Hey.
- I was just, um--

13:23.959 --> 13:26.208
Doing your freaky
obsessive voodoo shit?

13:26.208 --> 13:28.333
I know.
Jesus, you're weird.

13:28.333 --> 13:31.750
I feel like Adam is upstairs
putting on this really
brave face for me,

13:31.750 --> 13:35.291
but the minute
I leave tomorrow,
he's just gonna fall apart.

13:35.291 --> 13:39.375
( scoffs )
Don't flatter
yourself, please.

13:39.375 --> 13:41.542
Okay, you've actually
been really mean today.

13:41.542 --> 13:43.000
I'm not being mean.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.417
I'm-- well, I'm being
the exact right amount
of mean considering.

13:45.417 --> 13:49.875
- Considering what?
- Considering it's certainly
hypocritical of you to leave

13:49.875 --> 13:53.708
right after you told me
I need to come back to New York
and stay for good.

13:53.708 --> 13:58.125
- But, Jessa, I'm going--
- You're pussying out
on this whole thing.

13:58.125 --> 14:01.208
The thing that we're all
trying to do, which is
to make it work,

14:01.208 --> 14:03.417
regardless of location,
right where we are.

14:03.417 --> 14:06.083
Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way--

14:06.083 --> 14:09.125
- You know what else
is pussy?
- What?

14:09.125 --> 14:11.250
You don't even have
the bravery to break up
with Adam.

14:11.250 --> 14:12.708
I don't want
to break up with Adam.

14:12.708 --> 14:15.750
If you want
to be alone,
be alone.

14:15.750 --> 14:18.000
No one's gonna
be angry about that.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.583
You seem mad at me.

14:20.583 --> 14:23.000
No, no,
I'm not mad at you.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.250
I could give a shit.
You know?

14:25.250 --> 14:28.583
I mean, Jesus.
Don't make a big deal
out of it.

14:29.792 --> 14:31.000
( door closes )

14:31.000 --> 14:33.125
Hi, little ones.

14:33.125 --> 14:35.083
She bangs,
she bangs.

14:35.083 --> 14:38.417
- Right back
at ya, Marnie's mom.
- ( clicks tongue ) Uh-huh.

14:38.417 --> 14:40.500
I woke up in Harlem
smelling like moussaka

14:40.500 --> 14:42.000
and I didn't have time
to go home and change.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.125
There's a lot of really
exciting things happening
above 125th Street

14:45.125 --> 14:47.000
that I'm very happy
to know about.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.875
I stopped at the First
Corinthians Church for
a musical interlude

14:49.875 --> 14:52.792
and then on my way downtown,
I rescued a kitten.

14:52.792 --> 14:55.250
- Aw.
- Ooh, where is it?

14:55.959 --> 14:58.291
Pal:
Elijah?

15:02.166 --> 15:03.750
Hi, Pal.

15:03.750 --> 15:06.792
Um, wha-- hey.

15:06.792 --> 15:08.625
Hey.
You look good.

15:08.625 --> 15:11.291
I'm just here
brunching with the Lisas.

15:11.291 --> 15:14.667
- ( laughs )
- You are so not gonna be
tallying your booze points.

15:14.667 --> 15:16.917
- Vodka has no points.
- Yeah, keep telling
yourself that.

15:16.917 --> 15:19.166
Lisa:
No, my bikini waxer
told me that vodka...

15:19.166 --> 15:22.667
( quietly )
They're like the laziest
bulimics you've ever met.

15:22.667 --> 15:25.500
Okay, we are
Desi and Marnie.

15:25.500 --> 15:27.625
Um, or are we
Marnie and Desi?

15:27.625 --> 15:30.083
We'll talk about
that later, sir.

15:31.291 --> 15:32.667
- ( laughs )
- ( girl laughs )

15:32.667 --> 15:37.000
- And this is our newest ditty.
- Mom: Hallie, come back here.

No, like,

It's a nice world.

16:48.750 --> 16:51.250
I really didn't want
to see Marnie singing
today, actually,

16:51.250 --> 16:55.000
because female folk singers
remind me of being carsick
when I was little,

16:55.000 --> 16:58.208
but, um, I thought
that maybe I would see you

16:58.208 --> 17:02.125
and I wanted to say
that I'm sorry.

17:02.125 --> 17:03.875

you saying all that.

Honestly, too, you, like,
totally picked the best one

really liked Marnie.

that's not cool, bro.

All right?
Be respectful.
She's trying to sing.

19:52.834 --> 19:55.417
- Am I doing
something wrong?
- Stop, Marnie, stop.

19:55.417 --> 19:57.917
People aren't
even paying attention.
They're not even listening.

19:57.917 --> 20:00.125

It's just a couple kids.

This might be a good time
to talk with your loved ones

20:10.208 --> 20:12.125

about how your behavior

Marnie.

20:27.542 --> 20:30.667
Oh, God.
There's no point.

20:30.667 --> 20:33.625
There's no point
in what?

20:33.625 --> 20:35.750
Sharing my music.

20:35.750 --> 20:37.333
They were being
so fucking mean.

20:37.333 --> 20:38.583
They were laughing at me.

20:38.583 --> 20:40.583
Some of those songs
are about death.

20:40.583 --> 20:42.959
Marnie, this business
is not for sissy bitches.

20:42.959 --> 20:44.625
What?

20:44.625 --> 20:45.959
The crying, the shaking--

20:45.959 --> 20:48.000
I mean, you've gotta
give it a fuckin' rest.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.500
Elijah, where are
your manners?

20:50.500 --> 20:52.500
Look, honey,
if you want to do this,

20:52.500 --> 20:54.125
you've gotta thicken
your skin, okay?

20:54.125 --> 20:58.166
You should have stopped
giving a fuck when you
got on that stage.

20:58.166 --> 21:01.250
What do Judy Garland
and Lady Gaga have in common?

21:01.250 --> 21:03.542
- They're both white?
- No.

21:03.542 --> 21:07.542
They're both bad bitches
who don't give a fuck
what people think.

21:07.542 --> 21:09.667
They were told that
they weren't thin enough,

21:09.667 --> 21:11.125
that they weren't
feminine enough,

21:11.125 --> 21:13.458
that they weren't
beautiful enough.

21:13.458 --> 21:17.208
And then Judy went and died
'cause it all became too much.

21:17.208 --> 21:19.166
But Lady Gaga's fine.

21:19.166 --> 21:21.708
Be well, Elijah.

21:21.708 --> 21:26.834
Oh, and, Marnie,
you are so talented.

21:26.834 --> 21:29.000
Have you ever thought about
being a background artist?

21:29.000 --> 21:31.750
Because I have a friend
at Central Casting

21:31.750 --> 21:33.667
and she's always looking
for people to be, like,

21:33.667 --> 21:35.375
you know,
in a "Good Wife"
courtroom scene.

21:35.375 --> 21:38.083
Lisa #2:
Oh, or like "SVU" victim.

21:38.083 --> 21:40.208
You'd be
an amazing victim.

21:40.208 --> 21:41.375
Bye.

21:41.375 --> 21:43.458
So nice to meet you.

21:45.542 --> 21:47.708
I'm glad we broke up!

21:47.708 --> 21:50.166
What a little
fuckin' dick.

21:50.166 --> 21:51.959
You know what?
New York is such bullshit.

21:51.959 --> 21:55.291
If we lived anywhere else,
I would never have to worry
about seeing him

21:55.291 --> 21:59.041
because he would have
already killed himself
for being so small and gay.

21:59.041 --> 22:00.667
( crying continues )

22:03.083 --> 22:05.708
I can't believe
Marnie left without
saying good-bye.

22:05.708 --> 22:08.542
Maybe she had
another jazz lunch.

22:08.542 --> 22:11.125
Are you sure
it's okay that I'm leaving
all this stuff here?

22:11.125 --> 22:13.166
Yeah, it's
your apartment.

22:13.166 --> 22:15.583
Yeah, but I'm not gonna
be living here or paying rent,

22:15.583 --> 22:17.792
so you get to make
some decisions.

22:17.792 --> 22:20.500
( mumbles )

22:20.500 --> 22:22.917
I like being
amongst your stuff.

22:24.959 --> 22:26.750
You know I'm shit
on the phone, right?

22:26.750 --> 22:30.750
You're asking if I know
if you're shit on the phone?

22:30.750 --> 22:33.500
You take so many pauses
that I think you've hung up

22:33.500 --> 22:36.417
and the only way you respond
is, like, with this long groan.

22:36.417 --> 22:39.834
- Just like--
( groans )
- ( laughs )

22:40.917 --> 22:42.917
You're terrible
at the phone.

22:42.917 --> 22:45.417
( mumbles )

22:45.417 --> 22:47.041
Do you want to go over
the plan again?

22:47.041 --> 22:49.959
The plan is...

22:49.959 --> 22:52.583
there is no plan.

22:52.583 --> 22:55.166
That works for me.

22:55.166 --> 22:57.708
As a plan.

22:58.792 --> 23:00.959
It's a plan, then.

23:03.500 --> 23:05.250
Okay.

23:24.792 --> 23:27.333
- ( whispers )
Jesus fucking shit.
- ( knock on door )

23:27.333 --> 23:28.875
Mom, I will be
right out, okay?

23:28.875 --> 23:31.917
- Adam is sleeping.
- Marnie: No, it's me.

23:35.667 --> 23:37.875
What are you doing here?
It's 6:00 AM.

23:37.875 --> 23:39.500
Did you really think
you were gonna leave

23:39.500 --> 23:41.375
without me
saying good-bye?

23:41.375 --> 23:43.500
Well, I couldn't find you
after the gig anywhere.

23:43.500 --> 23:44.917
That place
was a shit show.

23:44.917 --> 23:46.417
That's the last time
I do a jazz brunch.

23:46.417 --> 23:48.834
I can't get my fucking
suitcase closed.

23:48.834 --> 23:51.083
Uh, have you tried
sitting on it?

23:53.458 --> 23:56.375
It's a volume thing
and it has to be
equally distributed,

23:56.375 --> 23:58.583
so you have to make sure
while you're packing

23:58.583 --> 24:03.000
that you actually
stack them full-- mmm.

24:11.959 --> 24:14.333
I think a vase
just broke underneath me.

24:14.333 --> 24:15.625
A vase?

24:15.625 --> 24:18.250
You put a vase
in the suitcase?

24:25.208 --> 24:27.333
( whispers )
Hey.

24:46.708 --> 24:48.375
Hey, party freaks.

24:48.375 --> 24:49.875
Are you serious
with that hat?

24:49.875 --> 24:51.667
- Tad: Yes.
- Loreen: Marnie
came to pack?

24:51.667 --> 24:55.583
- That's so sweet.
What a friend, right?
- Tad: A good pal.

24:59.417 --> 25:02.083
( sobbing )

25:02.083 --> 25:04.708
Hannah, could you
lend a hand here?

25:06.583 --> 25:07.959
Hannah:
Hey, Marnie, don't cry.

25:07.959 --> 25:09.834
I'm gonna text you
in, like, two seconds.

25:09.834 --> 25:13.834
- Marnie: I love you.
- ( car doors close )

25:16.333 --> 25:18.667
( car engine starts )

25:26.917 --> 25:30.041
( dog barking )

25:32.375 --> 25:34.083
Loreen:
Let's wait to get gas
in an hour.

25:34.083 --> 25:35.834
Tad:
No, let's not wait
to get gas. We only--

25:35.834 --> 25:37.875
Loreen:
No, no, no, I'm gonna have
to pee in about an hour.

25:37.875 --> 25:40.083
- Well, why can't you pee now?
- 'Cause I don't have
to pee now.

25:40.083 --> 25:41.667
We've only got
a quarter of a tank.

25:41.667 --> 25:43.667
No, I'm gonna have to pee
in an hour, so let's just wait.

25:43.667 --> 25:45.250
Tad:
Hannah might
want a snack.

25:45.250 --> 25:47.458
Loreen:
I've got a whole bag
of Fig Newtons.

25:47.458 --> 25:51.542
- She loves  'em.
- Oh, wow, there you go.
Fig Newtons.
