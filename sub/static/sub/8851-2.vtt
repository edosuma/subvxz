00:00.232 --> 00:02.952
Previously on AMC's Hell On Wheels.

00:03.179 --> 00:04.782
Payroll train's been robbed again.

00:05.010 --> 00:06.456
Seems we'll be needing your services.

00:06.681 --> 00:08.436
You ain't gonna believe this boy.

00:09.595 --> 00:10.642
What are you doin' here?

00:10.851 --> 00:12.388
Tryin' to keep you
from gettin' yourself killed.

00:12.595 --> 00:13.950
You don't believe in me anymore.

00:14.896 --> 00:17.110
Nobody's gonna care about
the killing of a prostitute.

00:17.318 --> 00:19.027
Would you like to join us for supper?

00:19.237 --> 00:20.903
Look how far I've fallen.

00:21.106 --> 00:23.198
The Sioux believe this land is scared.

00:23.405 --> 00:25.632
I call the shots here,
not you.

00:25.837 --> 00:27.643
Wake up cause you're next.

00:51.206 --> 00:53.206
Here, Jenny.

00:53.274 --> 00:55.040
Got some feed.

00:58.643 --> 01:00.577
Bessie.

01:00.645 --> 01:02.478
Mr. Toole!

01:02.546 --> 01:04.614
Rise and shine!

01:19.071 --> 01:20.906
Morning, Samuel.

01:20.974 --> 01:22.443
Ehh.

02:32.109 --> 02:34.675
Samuel!

02:34.743 --> 02:37.447
Samuel, did you hear that?

03:11.509 --> 03:13.413
I don't want to. Put me down!

03:24.029 --> 03:25.763
Aaigh!

04:37.370 --> 04:39.736
Now, Mr. Bohannon,

04:39.804 --> 04:42.506
you are guilty of armed
robbery and sedition,

04:42.574 --> 04:43.640
a capital offense.

04:45.473 --> 04:47.407
I may be able to get that commuted to life

04:47.474 --> 04:50.511
if you give me the names of your cohorts.

04:50.579 --> 04:53.412
Yeah. I might just fly my ass out of here

04:53.480 --> 04:56.415
if I sprout me some wings. Heh heh.

05:14.857 --> 05:17.557
Now, let's try this again.

05:17.624 --> 05:21.057
The names of the
confederates you rode with.

05:22.660 --> 05:23.858
You think they wouldn't
give you up in a heartbeat

05:23.926 --> 05:25.558
if they were in your spot?

05:31.631 --> 05:33.420
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait.

05:33.496 --> 05:37.704
I'll tell you. I'll tell you
their names, all right?

05:39.977 --> 05:41.511
Wise decision.

05:46.654 --> 05:51.362
Their... their names were...

05:51.429 --> 05:53.597
Robert...

05:53.665 --> 05:56.900
E...Lee,

05:56.968 --> 05:59.371
Stonewall Jackson,

05:59.439 --> 06:01.741
Jeb Stuart,

06:01.811 --> 06:03.713
Nathan Bedford forr...

06:09.685 --> 06:11.620
leave him!

07:08.392 --> 07:09.528
Mitt herredømme?

07:12.245 --> 07:15.565
What in God's name is...

07:19.306 --> 07:21.906
sorry to disturb your
slumber, mitt herredømme,

07:21.974 --> 07:23.642
but I was passing the railroad office.

07:23.709 --> 07:27.449
An important, urgent message has arrived.

07:30.621 --> 07:32.755
You may retrieve my chamber pot

07:32.823 --> 07:34.558
at a more reasonable hour, Gundersen.

07:34.674 --> 07:37.227
Of course.

07:44.567 --> 07:46.169
Good day.

07:48.805 --> 07:50.741
Thomas, what is it?

07:52.446 --> 07:57.520
Indians. Attacked Durant.

07:57.587 --> 08:02.360
Apparently burned the place to the ground.

08:11.379 --> 08:13.713
Let's go! We got to get moving!

08:17.350 --> 08:20.086
Everybody!

08:24.792 --> 08:26.692
Mr. Ferguson!

08:26.759 --> 08:28.896
Where do you think you're going?

08:28.963 --> 08:30.564
Thought you might need my help, sir.

08:30.632 --> 08:34.101
No, I need you here to protect my railroad.

08:34.168 --> 08:40.008
Yes, sir, Mr. Durant, sir.

08:45.319 --> 08:48.920
Potatoes, meat, what's left of the cheese.

08:48.988 --> 08:52.261
This blanket is thin, so keep
your coat buttoned tight.

08:52.329 --> 08:54.861
Ruth, I'm only gonna be gone a day.

08:57.430 --> 09:00.336
To keep you safe.

09:01.036 --> 09:02.839
Child.

09:02.907 --> 09:05.609
You have forsaken me.

09:05.677 --> 09:06.679
Father!

09:06.845 --> 09:08.804
Why did you not come to me when you heard?

09:08.923 --> 09:11.654
Because we have no use for you.

09:11.722 --> 09:14.794
But I... I can help stop the bloodshed.

09:14.862 --> 09:16.176
Jesus... Jesus said...

09:16.247 --> 09:20.300
that Bible means nothing to them, reverend.

09:20.368 --> 09:22.737
I know you view our relations
with these savages

09:22.805 --> 09:24.480
as some kind of divine mission.

09:24.586 --> 09:28.745
Trust me, God has forsaken all of us.

09:28.813 --> 09:32.481
Your services are not necessary.

09:34.315 --> 09:36.415
Father, sorry.

09:41.983 --> 09:43.749
I'll be home soon.

10:13.786 --> 10:15.855
Sit down.

11:05.897 --> 11:07.709
What happened, Mr. Toole?

11:08.996 --> 11:12.137
A band of braves rode in from the west,

11:12.205 --> 11:14.338
attacked at daybreak,

11:14.406 --> 11:15.810
scorched the very earth.

11:15.811 --> 11:17.269
Ying

11:17.338 --> 11:19.139
did they damage the track?

11:19.207 --> 11:21.143
Not as I can tell, sir.

11:21.211 --> 11:22.910
Steal anything?

11:22.977 --> 11:24.144
No, sir.

11:24.211 --> 11:25.778
How many killed?

11:25.845 --> 11:29.015
7 men and 2 women.

11:29.082 --> 11:32.952
Bleedin' savages.

11:33.020 --> 11:34.654
What tribe?

11:34.722 --> 11:35.855
You even know how to tell?

11:36.408 --> 11:38.732
Sorry. I was too busy
saving me lily-white arse,

11:38.872 --> 11:40.593
if you know what I mean.

11:40.661 --> 11:42.722
They didn't look like Cheyenne to me,

11:42.917 --> 11:45.193
if that's what you're wondering.

11:45.765 --> 11:48.700
There they are!

12:02.047 --> 12:05.149
They're Santee Sioux.

12:05.216 --> 12:06.617
Sioux?

12:06.685 --> 12:08.851
But this is Cheyenne territory.

12:08.919 --> 12:11.988
Why are they attacking so far from home?

12:12.056 --> 12:14.794
This was a murder raid.

12:14.862 --> 12:18.398
They're sending you a message.

12:18.465 --> 12:20.630
What message?

12:20.698 --> 12:24.363
That you're now at war
with the Sioux nation.

12:31.594 --> 12:33.194
Ying

13:48.946 --> 13:51.773
ying

13:54.846 --> 13:56.514
you got a visitor.

13:58.750 --> 14:00.619
Visitor?

14:00.687 --> 14:02.822
Make it fast.

14:05.124 --> 14:07.460
What in the hell are you doing here?

14:09.631 --> 14:12.500
Don't worry. Paid them guards a nice stack

14:12.568 --> 14:14.087
of yankee bills.

14:15.475 --> 14:18.975
Stupid ass.

14:19.043 --> 14:21.412
They, uh...

14:21.480 --> 14:23.313
They tell you when yet?

14:23.381 --> 14:24.493
It's bound to be soon.

14:24.566 --> 14:27.418
They're running out of people to shoot.

14:30.689 --> 14:33.491
I'm sorry, Cullen.

14:33.558 --> 14:34.599
Don't start, doc.

14:34.665 --> 14:37.229
I got you caught up in this
nonsense to begin with.

14:37.296 --> 14:39.097
I, uh...

14:39.165 --> 14:41.332
I should have never dragged you into it.

14:41.400 --> 14:42.532
You and me's square.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.768
Now get the hell on out of here.

14:52.351 --> 14:54.580
You make your peace yet, son?

14:57.383 --> 14:59.390
What you suppose the lord's gonna think

14:59.461 --> 15:01.718
about a man like me, huh?

15:01.785 --> 15:04.486
He knows what's in your heart.

15:24.814 --> 15:26.850
I murdered a man.

15:29.854 --> 15:33.460
He was innocent.

15:33.528 --> 15:35.328
I wrapped my hands around his throat,

15:35.396 --> 15:36.438
and I looked him in the eyes,

15:36.522 --> 15:41.602
and I choked the life right out of him.

15:41.669 --> 15:46.904
I know you must feel... you
must feel bad about that, son.

15:46.971 --> 15:50.608
That's just the thing.

15:50.675 --> 15:53.143
I don't feel nothing about that.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.049
Not a damn thing.

16:04.961 --> 16:07.332
It's time. Come on, now.

16:11.770 --> 16:13.620
I'll pray for you, son.

16:17.379 --> 16:20.116
If you're gonna pray,

16:20.184 --> 16:21.825
pray for me to die well, doc.

16:21.932 --> 16:23.956
That's all I got left.

16:28.287 --> 16:30.666
A small deposit will secure a lot

16:30.734 --> 16:32.534
fit for tent accommodations.

16:32.601 --> 16:37.871
However, the tents themselves
are for sale, not rent,

16:37.939 --> 16:40.738
but for a slightly larger deposit,

16:40.805 --> 16:43.074
you can pitch your flag closer to town.

16:43.141 --> 16:45.076
Mr. McGinnes. Yeah?

16:45.144 --> 16:47.078
These people lost everything.

16:47.146 --> 16:48.713
They need shelter.

16:51.421 --> 16:53.956
What size lot can they afford?

16:54.024 --> 16:56.065
Really, Mr. McGinnes. We'll not profit

16:56.241 --> 16:59.896
or further people's misery.

16:59.963 --> 17:01.530
Bloody good that,

17:01.598 --> 17:03.329
coming from an englishwoman.

17:03.397 --> 17:04.731
I bet your pardon?

17:04.799 --> 17:06.869
Ah, you people built an empire of misery

17:06.957 --> 17:08.685
on the backs of the Irish
and everyone else,

17:08.866 --> 17:10.367
haven't you?

17:10.435 --> 17:11.932
The point is, Mr. McGinnes,

17:12.055 --> 17:14.441
that these people need a place to live,

17:14.509 --> 17:16.511
and we have land here, for everyone.

17:16.579 --> 17:18.512
Mr. Durant, with whom I have an agreement,

17:18.580 --> 17:19.580
has land.

17:19.648 --> 17:21.117
Do you speak for him?

17:21.184 --> 17:23.653
As a matter of fact, I do.

17:27.661 --> 17:29.362
My agreement with Mr. Durant

17:29.429 --> 17:31.897
states my percentage for
brokering his land,

17:31.967 --> 17:34.502
plus a stake in all tents I provide.

17:34.570 --> 17:35.971
Then we'll negotiate a settlement.

17:36.038 --> 17:37.540
How's that, Mr. McGinnes?

17:37.608 --> 17:38.874
And my brokerage fee.

17:38.941 --> 17:40.097
Of course.

17:40.730 --> 17:42.212
After all,

17:42.280 --> 17:46.087
this is not England or Ireland, is it?

17:46.155 --> 17:49.756
It is, in fact, America, Mrs. Bell.

17:49.824 --> 17:53.393
Yes, and welcome to it.

17:53.460 --> 17:57.764
Good day, Mr. McGinnes.

17:57.831 --> 17:59.064
As I was saying...

17:59.132 --> 18:00.599
Ready...

18:04.705 --> 18:06.305
Fire!

18:23.755 --> 18:25.757
Afternoon, boys.

18:25.825 --> 18:29.494
Going out to play in the water again?

18:30.696 --> 18:34.798
Hold him tight. I got to get the...
hang on.

18:34.865 --> 18:35.966
Take him out.

18:36.034 --> 18:38.534
Thought you liked me, boys.

18:38.602 --> 18:40.268
Give it a go.

18:40.336 --> 18:42.705
Hold him!

18:42.772 --> 18:44.374
Come on. It takes 3 of y'all

18:44.441 --> 18:45.674
to kill one confederate?

18:45.742 --> 18:47.108
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.

18:47.176 --> 18:48.343
Keep moving.

18:49.679 --> 18:52.214
You sons of bitches gonna answer me?

19:01.016 --> 19:04.231
Just do it. Get it over with.

19:08.368 --> 19:09.901
You still there?

19:19.478 --> 19:22.747
Where the hell did y'all go?

19:22.815 --> 19:24.380
I was ready.

19:27.586 --> 19:30.288
Get back in here.

19:30.356 --> 19:31.890
I'll skin your asses alive

19:31.958 --> 19:34.861
and run you back across the bull run!

19:34.929 --> 19:37.866
Come on and finish this job right now!

19:39.661 --> 19:42.941
What's the rush, Mr. Bohannon?

20:03.037 --> 20:05.903
I just heard about, um...

20:05.968 --> 20:08.903
The girl who died here a few days ago.

20:08.972 --> 20:11.977
Yes. Um, the whore who was murdered.

20:16.111 --> 20:18.213
She was my friend.

20:20.482 --> 20:24.047
I'm sorry.

20:24.115 --> 20:29.720
You should know, Eva, I... I did
secure her a proper burial.

20:29.788 --> 20:32.724
Yeah. All due respect,

20:32.791 --> 20:34.104
a burial don't do nothing

20:34.216 --> 20:36.894
for the girls still there,

20:36.962 --> 20:42.697
and I want the man responsible
to pay for what he did.

20:47.399 --> 20:49.466
Eva, the situation...

20:51.670 --> 20:57.005
It would be difficult to convince
people to do the right thing.

20:57.073 --> 20:57.811
Because she was as whore?

20:57.883 --> 20:59.341
No. I didn't say that.

20:59.409 --> 21:02.577
She didn't deserve what she got.

21:05.182 --> 21:06.849
I understand.

21:12.702 --> 21:14.605
What the hell you doing here, anyway?

21:19.147 --> 21:23.076
This is a warrant for your execution.

21:23.767 --> 21:25.512
Yeah. No shit.

21:28.095 --> 21:29.534
And this...

21:30.971 --> 21:32.400
Is a pardon...

21:34.418 --> 21:37.357
Signed by my friend Edwin Stanton,

21:37.358 --> 21:39.064
secretary of war.

21:42.506 --> 21:44.813
Playing God comes natural to you, don't it?

21:46.313 --> 21:47.539
Well, yes, it does.

21:49.526 --> 21:52.160
But like any benevolent God...

21:53.151 --> 21:54.749
I'm here to help you.

21:55.759 --> 21:57.964
I'm supposed to believe you
don't want nothing out of this?

21:57.965 --> 21:59.347
On the contrary.

21:59.420 --> 22:01.773
My motives are purely selfish.

22:01.938 --> 22:06.116
But that is not to say that
you can't benefit as well.

22:08.305 --> 22:10.489
You have a lot of unfinished business

22:10.490 --> 22:12.610
on this earth, Mr. Bohannon.

22:14.277 --> 22:15.873
What will it be...

22:17.387 --> 22:18.672
life...

22:19.744 --> 22:21.024
Or death?

22:41.422 --> 22:43.029
I hope it's first-class.

23:02.456 --> 23:03.440
All right.

23:04.475 --> 23:05.584
Thank you.

23:12.034 --> 23:13.562
You sure you got to do that?

23:26.544 --> 23:28.673
That's for robbing my railroad.

24:03.052 --> 24:05.194
It takes a tragedy to fill our church.

24:05.292 --> 24:06.647
God is at work.

24:06.648 --> 24:08.311
His ways are mysterious.

24:09.358 --> 24:10.992
Maybe your God works too hard.

24:12.840 --> 24:14.629
He is our God, Joseph.

24:17.320 --> 24:19.729
Father. You should be in bed.

24:20.151 --> 24:22.776
How sharper than a serpent's tooth.

24:25.007 --> 24:26.300
And he maketh...

24:28.642 --> 24:31.215
His angels to the wind

24:31.558 --> 24:34.739
and his minister into the flame of fire.

24:34.740 --> 24:35.810
Father, stop.

24:36.951 --> 24:39.150
These people have lost their homes.

24:39.814 --> 24:41.211
This isn't the time.

24:42.395 --> 24:43.616
Go...

24:44.422 --> 24:45.643
Please?

24:50.960 --> 24:53.087
Don't judge, or you, too, will be judged.

24:53.088 --> 24:54.305
You, too.

24:55.292 --> 24:56.512
Reverend...

24:57.320 --> 24:58.612
Please, father.

24:59.126 --> 25:00.323
No.

25:05.848 --> 25:07.017
This is my church.

25:08.295 --> 25:09.547
It's best you go.

25:32.629 --> 25:33.831
Welcome back.

25:38.336 --> 25:41.517
Well, if it ain't Mr. Ferguson.

25:47.240 --> 25:49.388
Sad state of affairs right here.

25:50.665 --> 25:51.874
You come here to gloat?

25:51.875 --> 25:54.896
No. No, no.

25:55.465 --> 25:57.030
I come to give you this.

26:00.089 --> 26:02.492
Something to see you through
till you get back on your feet.

26:05.216 --> 26:06.580
I don't think so.

26:09.519 --> 26:10.903
Your husband ain't gonna approve?

26:10.904 --> 26:12.399
No. I don't approve.

26:14.004 --> 26:15.275
And why don't you save that money

26:15.276 --> 26:17.234
for one of them fancy suits?

26:19.321 --> 26:20.726
I was just trying to help.

26:35.860 --> 26:39.043
A whole race of people will be wiped off

26:39.044 --> 26:42.986
the face of the earth by this iron beast.

26:43.022 --> 26:44.364
Perhaps.

26:46.040 --> 26:47.270
Then again...

26:49.107 --> 26:51.672
Maybe the sioux have a beast of their own.

26:54.078 --> 26:57.022
Have you heard of the white
spirit, reverend Cole?

26:58.682 --> 27:00.365
It's an old Indian legend.

27:00.366 --> 27:04.331
Aye. Oh, it's more than a legend.

27:06.202 --> 27:09.005
Now is his season...

27:10.519 --> 27:13.302
For the white spirit comes with the cold,

27:13.822 --> 27:16.504
feasting on blood and human flesh,

27:16.505 --> 27:20.542
leaving nothing but famine and
pestilence for his enemies.

27:22.342 --> 27:23.657
And I look...

27:24.641 --> 27:26.761
And behold the pale horse.

27:26.762 --> 27:27.907
Nej.

27:29.465 --> 27:30.773
Whose name...

27:32.393 --> 27:35.529
It's his name that sat on him

27:35.530 --> 27:36.702
was death.

27:38.330 --> 27:40.499
And hell will follow with him.

27:42.681 --> 27:44.263
"Revelation"?

27:46.433 --> 27:47.678
Yeah.

27:48.420 --> 27:49.674
Yes...

27:49.675 --> 27:54.424
It will be apocalyptic.

27:54.425 --> 27:55.606
Yeah.

27:56.182 --> 27:59.558
Where a tide of blood will be unleashed.

28:00.057 --> 28:01.130
Indian blood, no doubt.

28:01.131 --> 28:02.381
Nej, nej, nej.

28:02.382 --> 28:04.740
The white spirit will prevail.

28:06.201 --> 28:08.442
I don't believe such things, Swede.

28:10.637 --> 28:13.441
Ahh. All right.

28:15.047 --> 28:17.486
May I show you something, then?

28:18.308 --> 28:19.369
Heh.

28:33.189 --> 28:34.535
What the...

28:34.536 --> 28:37.143
I dug this up by the river side.

28:39.425 --> 28:40.598
What in...

28:42.619 --> 28:44.255
what in God's name is this?

28:44.256 --> 28:48.084
There are more things in heaven and earth

28:48.085 --> 28:52.406
than are dreamt of in your
philosophy, reverend Cole.

I want to be sure he never does it again.

Nah, I don't think so.

Well, I know...

33:56.980 --> 33:59.076
I know you're the type of man

that likes to do his dirty
work from a distance.

34:02.624 --> 34:04.314

34:14.868 --> 34:17.725
Why don't you ask me for a stay, huh?

No.

Here you go.

Mornin'.

36:12.945 --> 36:14.667
Something I can do for you?

36:14.668 --> 36:15.900
Don't know.

36:16.479 --> 36:17.656
Is there?

36:22.244 --> 36:24.199
Maybe there is something you can do for me.

36:26.182 --> 36:27.831
And what would that be?

36:28.537 --> 36:30.585
I got me a whore that needs killing.

36:33.946 --> 36:35.250
I can't help you.

36:35.251 --> 36:36.498
I heard you can.

36:37.464 --> 36:39.509
Heard you the last customer
that poor girl had

36:39.510 --> 36:41.451
the night before she got beat to death.

36:42.500 --> 36:44.605
You better watch yourself, boy.

36:45.040 --> 36:48.510
The only thing worth less in
this town than a dead whore,

36:48.511 --> 36:50.476
a nigger don't know his place.

36:52.991 --> 36:54.752
So will you do it for me?

36:56.571 --> 36:58.343
You know who I am?

36:58.998 --> 37:00.385
Yes, sir.

37:00.386 --> 37:03.902
Mr. schmidt, foreman of the railroad...

37:06.246 --> 37:07.856
And whore killer.

37:12.131 --> 37:13.431
I just need you to tell me you did it

37:13.432 --> 37:15.065
before I shoot you in the gut.

37:16.634 --> 37:18.255
You're not gonna shoot me.

37:21.373 --> 37:23.000
Everybody would hear.

37:37.126 --> 37:39.159
Yes, I killed the bitch.

37:43.845 --> 37:45.044
You right.

37:45.513 --> 37:47.221
I ain't gonna shoot you right now.

38:46.563 --> 38:48.612
I like what you done with the place.

38:50.213 --> 38:51.767

39:01.070 --> 39:03.767
