File A56-7W. Top secret.
Subject.: Airwolf.

01:03.586 --> 01:05.382
A Mach 1-plus
attack helicopter,

01:05.453 --> 01:07.319
sought by governments
friendly and foreign,

01:07.389 --> 01:10.222
Airwolf has been hidden
by test pilot
Stringfellow Hawke

01:10.292 --> 01:11.657
to be returned
to the government

01:11.727 --> 01:15.493
only if his brother
Saint John, an MIA in Vietnam,
can be found.

01:16.198 --> 01:19.429
Michael Coldsmith-Briggs III,
code name Archangel,

01:19.502 --> 01:23.063
deputy director
of the intelligence agency
that developed Airwolf,

01:23.139 --> 01:25.437
believed to covertly
provide logistical support

01:25.508 --> 01:27.339
to Hawke in exchange
for flying Airwolf

01:27.409 --> 01:29.434
on missions
of national interest.

01:29.512 --> 01:32.413
Hawke is 34, reclusive,
sensitive, a loner,

01:32.481 --> 01:35.882
known to associate
with his only friend
and mentor, Dominic Santini.

01:35.951 --> 01:38.078
Together, Hawke and Santini
fly Airwolf

01:38.154 --> 01:40.213
at speeds rivaling
the fastest jets.

01:40.289 --> 01:41.950
Backed by unmatched firepower,

01:42.024 --> 01:43.651
Airwolf is a weapon
too dangerous

01:43.726 --> 01:45.318
to be left
in unenlightened hands.

01:45.394 --> 01:47.828
Finding Airwolf is
your number one priority.

01:47.897 --> 01:49.296
End of file.

02:32.274 --> 02:34.469
(Sayes)
Hold that truck at 60!

02:54.296 --> 02:56.821
That idiot is going to run
out of road.

03:03.572 --> 03:05.972
Vinnie, you're running
out of time.

03:20.556 --> 03:22.956
Vinnie.
Vinnie, are you all right?

03:26.462 --> 03:28.191
[people chattering]

03:41.777 --> 03:43.506
(man #1)
He dropped right here.

03:43.579 --> 03:46.571
(man #2)
Come on, guys, let's go see
if he's all right.

03:47.650 --> 03:49.515
Hey! Hey!

03:53.389 --> 03:55.289
Vinnie, are you all right?
Vinnie!

03:55.724 --> 03:58.716
Yeah. At least
l'm in one piece.

03:59.728 --> 04:01.628
This thing can't be done.

04:02.798 --> 04:04.891
Come on.
Help him out. Come on.

04:09.571 --> 04:11.163
[Vinnie coughing]

04:11.373 --> 04:12.704
Hello, Simon.

04:13.842 --> 04:16.675
l see you have succeeded
in failing again.

04:17.112 --> 04:21.481
l'm sorry, Mr. Maurice,
but l don't really think
that stunt can be done.

04:21.550 --> 04:23.848
The script was approved
and budgeted.

04:23.919 --> 04:25.750
You agreed to it, Simon.

04:25.821 --> 04:27.220
There'll be no changes.

04:27.289 --> 04:30.019
Vinnie is
one of the best pilots
in the business.

04:30.092 --> 04:32.526
He did the flying
in the Green Cloudburst film.

04:32.594 --> 04:34.391
Who's the best, Simon?

04:34.463 --> 04:36.488
Santini Air,
but that won't be easy.

04:36.565 --> 04:39.398
l'll only deal with
legitimate organizations.

04:39.435 --> 04:41.665
Well, they're legitimate,
all right.

04:41.704 --> 04:44.639
lt's, uh, just that
they're a lot more eXpensive.

04:44.707 --> 04:46.368
Mr. Sayes,

04:46.442 --> 04:50.105
l discovered you
at the bottom of the barrel
of used-to-be directors.

04:50.179 --> 04:53.239
l've given you
the opportunity
to become a wealthy man

04:53.315 --> 04:55.510
if this film is successful.

04:55.851 --> 04:58.718
do not pinch pennies
on my behalf or yours.

04:58.787 --> 05:00.448
Now, do you understand?

05:00.889 --> 05:02.322
l think so.

05:03.025 --> 05:05.152
No, don't think, Sayes.

05:05.594 --> 05:07.152
Just listen

05:08.430 --> 05:09.624
and do.

05:11.800 --> 05:12.858
Yes, sir.

05:13.068 --> 05:14.262
[screeching]

05:18.907 --> 05:21.000
(dominic)
What have you got
against rich?

05:21.076 --> 05:23.408
(Hawke)
l don't know.
l never did it.

05:24.012 --> 05:26.640
Ah, ''Rich'' ain't an ''it,''
it's an ''is.''

05:26.715 --> 05:27.909
That's lousy English.

05:27.983 --> 05:30.508
Well, l'm talkin' money,
not pronunciation.

05:31.053 --> 05:32.418
l don't need any
right now.

05:32.488 --> 05:34.080
Ah, ah, but l do.

05:34.156 --> 05:35.350
¢Ü¢Ü[classical music
playing on stereo]

05:35.424 --> 05:39.190
So l'm supposed
to land on a truck
going 60 miles an hour?

05:39.261 --> 05:40.888
No. l'm going to.

05:41.163 --> 05:43.427
l need you
to work ground control.

05:45.234 --> 05:47.134
You want me
to work ground?

05:47.202 --> 05:49.432
Yeah, you.
Why, what's the matter?

05:51.340 --> 05:52.807
Nothin', dom.

05:56.879 --> 05:59.313
ls the money really
all that important?

05:59.681 --> 06:01.774
What are you trying
to say?

06:01.884 --> 06:03.613
Come on, spit it out, String.

06:03.685 --> 06:06.745
You're chewin' on something
and not swallowin'.

06:08.490 --> 06:11.152
l don't think
you ought to do this stunt.

06:13.395 --> 06:15.795
What, are you sayin'
l can't do it?

06:15.964 --> 06:17.329
You think l'm washed up?

06:17.399 --> 06:20.334
dom, l can't run the 100
in 10 seconds anymore.

06:20.936 --> 06:22.528
And l can't stay up
for three days

06:22.604 --> 06:24.834
and bounce back
with four hours' sleep.

06:24.973 --> 06:27.498
And sometimes,
when it's real damp and cold,

06:27.576 --> 06:31.012
the man-made cracks
in these bones of mine
ache like hell.

06:32.247 --> 06:35.739
l try to remember that
when l take one
of these jobs.

06:37.519 --> 06:40.113
Well, maybe you're the one
that's gettin' old.

06:40.189 --> 06:42.521
But l'm not ready
to retire yet.

06:42.825 --> 06:45.350
l'm flyin' this stunt
with or without you.

06:55.370 --> 06:57.361
(Maurice)
Stringfellow Hawke?

06:58.240 --> 07:00.333
ls the name for real?

07:00.709 --> 07:02.472
(dominic)
lt's for real.

07:02.544 --> 07:04.603
Only he won't be
doin' the flyin'. l will.

07:04.680 --> 07:05.669
Oh.

07:07.082 --> 07:08.481
Great stuff, huh?

07:09.318 --> 07:12.549
l just might consider
investing in an orchard.
Hey, Simon?

07:13.555 --> 07:14.749
(Maurice)
Gentlemen.

07:16.058 --> 07:18.583
To the test run
late this afternoon.

07:19.394 --> 07:21.362
There'll be no test run.

07:24.566 --> 07:27.865
l believe l'm covering
the cost of the test
in the overall deal.

07:28.504 --> 07:30.495
Look, Mr. Santini,

07:30.706 --> 07:33.266
l just want to make sure
that you can do it,
that's all.

07:33.342 --> 07:34.570
Oh, l'm sure.

07:34.643 --> 07:36.907
Because l'm not plannin'
on killin' myself.

07:36.979 --> 07:40.608
Well, then why not
do the practice run
just to satisfy me?

07:41.350 --> 07:44.478
Mister, l've got 30 years
of practicing under my belt.

07:44.553 --> 07:46.680
l don't think
l need any more.

07:46.755 --> 07:51.215
Besides, it's gonna
take me a couple of days
just to rig the helicopter,

07:51.293 --> 07:53.591
do some figurin'
on the weights.

07:53.662 --> 07:56.028
And he said
there wasn't much time.

07:56.832 --> 07:58.823
From what l hear,
this, uh,

07:58.934 --> 07:59.923
[laughs]

08:00.035 --> 08:03.129
this Stringfellow Hawke
does most of the flying.

08:04.540 --> 08:06.235
l'm Santini Air.

08:06.708 --> 08:08.767
l decide
who flies my equipment,

08:08.844 --> 08:10.709
or who uses my equipment.

08:10.779 --> 08:13.976
l'll deliver,
or you don't have
to pay a red cent.

08:14.516 --> 08:17.212
Without this stunt
my film doesn't work.

08:17.519 --> 08:20.386
Are you willing
to pick up the cost
if you fail?

08:21.757 --> 08:22.746
Yeah.

08:22.824 --> 08:24.985
You could lose
your whole business.

08:26.128 --> 08:28.562
lt's my business
to lose, isn't it?

08:29.531 --> 08:33.490
Mr. Santini,
you've got yourself a deal.

08:34.535 --> 08:38.302
Welcome aboard.
Oh, by the way, Mr. Sayes
will handle everything.

08:38.373 --> 08:39.703
Gentlemen.

08:54.590 --> 08:56.751
What if he
doesn't pull it off?

08:57.926 --> 09:01.225
The man is betting
everything he owns
on his ability.

09:01.997 --> 09:03.658
He could
still be wrong.

09:04.199 --> 09:05.257
l know.

09:05.367 --> 09:07.301
That's why l want you
to contact this, uh...

09:07.369 --> 09:08.529
Stringfellow.

09:08.637 --> 09:09.729
Whatever.

09:09.805 --> 09:10.931
[laughs]

09:18.347 --> 09:19.837
[car honking]

09:38.367 --> 09:39.527
Good morning, Edward.

09:39.601 --> 09:42.502
Morning. l can't
drink coffee anymore.

09:42.571 --> 09:43.868
Gets my nerves raggedy.

09:43.939 --> 09:45.167
l know that.

09:45.941 --> 09:48.842
Take it. lt's orange juice.

09:48.910 --> 09:50.275
[Maurice chuckles]

09:50.679 --> 09:54.672
lf l didn't know you better,
Mr. Maurice, l'd swear
my mother sent you.

09:54.750 --> 09:56.445
God rest her soul.

09:57.519 --> 10:00.818
What do you say
we hold the services
for later, all right?

10:00.889 --> 10:02.618
Sorry, Mr. Maurice.

10:02.691 --> 10:04.716
l'm just a little nervous.

10:05.527 --> 10:07.757
l think
this should calm you down.

10:10.499 --> 10:14.128
l--l won't be able
to have the final schedule
until tomorrow.

10:15.337 --> 10:17.202
Tomorrow will be fine.

10:17.773 --> 10:19.707
What if l'm not on duty?

10:19.775 --> 10:21.606
Make sure you're there.

10:22.210 --> 10:25.111
Yeah, but you see,
it doesn't work that way,
Mr. Maurice.

10:25.180 --> 10:28.638
Mr. Stoner, you telling me
that you might be
unable to deliver?

10:28.717 --> 10:30.446
No. No. l'll come through.

10:30.652 --> 10:32.176
l'm sure you will.

10:32.254 --> 10:35.155
You don't have to worry
about me, Mr. Maurice.

10:35.323 --> 10:37.951
l have to worry
about everything, Ed.

10:38.994 --> 10:41.690
You only have to worry
about your health.

10:51.206 --> 10:53.265
¢Ü¢Ü[music playing on stereo]

10:54.443 --> 10:56.707
(Hawke)
You seem to have gone
to an awful lot of trouble

10:56.778 --> 10:58.405
contacting me by radio

10:58.980 --> 11:01.642
just to see if dominic Santini
can fly.

11:01.717 --> 11:04.117
Well, l know
he can fly, Mr. Hawke,

11:04.453 --> 11:06.751
but can he do it
as well as you?

11:07.355 --> 11:08.788
He taught me.

11:08.957 --> 11:10.424
How long ago?

11:11.460 --> 11:14.793
dominic is one of
the best chopper pilots
in the business.

11:15.030 --> 11:17.794
[laughing]
l hear that you're the best.

11:22.971 --> 11:25.963
Mr. Santini has given us
a completion guarantee

11:26.508 --> 11:28.738
that will either make him
a great deal of money

11:28.810 --> 11:30.539
or lose him his business.

11:31.079 --> 11:33.479
What's important
is that if he fails,

11:33.548 --> 11:35.015
my film fails.

11:35.450 --> 11:36.917
What's important

11:37.552 --> 11:40.419
is that if he fails,
he could lose his life.

11:41.256 --> 11:43.884
Yes. lt would be a shame.
Naturally.

11:44.860 --> 11:48.296
And apparently,
it concerns you
as much as it does me.

11:48.964 --> 11:51.933
The only thing
that seems to concern you
is your film.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.492
Well, l believe we can
satisfy all our purposes

11:56.071 --> 11:58.039
if you fly the stunt for me.

11:58.373 --> 11:59.931
lt's dominic's company.

12:00.008 --> 12:01.908
l can't tell him what to do.

12:01.977 --> 12:03.103
What is it? The money?

12:03.178 --> 12:05.169
l'm sure l can
sway your thinking.

12:05.247 --> 12:06.839
lt's not the money.

12:08.083 --> 12:09.414
Of course.

12:10.118 --> 12:12.814
l'm sure
you'd like to keep him
hale and hearty.

12:12.888 --> 12:13.946
Here's my offer.

12:14.022 --> 12:16.081
l'll disregard
the completion guarantee

12:16.158 --> 12:17.921
if you'll fly
the stunt sequence.

12:17.993 --> 12:21.554
And, win or lose,
your friend Mr. Santini
gets the best of it.

12:21.630 --> 12:23.757
His health
and a sizable profit.

12:23.832 --> 12:26.164
l can't tell dominic
what to do.

12:27.035 --> 12:28.593
He's his own man.

12:34.676 --> 12:36.200
Think about it.

12:37.078 --> 12:39.273
But l want an answer
by tomorrow noon.

12:39.347 --> 12:41.338
l can give you one
right now.

12:41.650 --> 12:44.483
There's no way
that l'm going to
undercut dominic.

12:45.921 --> 12:48.253
Even if you
could save his life?

You know,
junk food will kill you.

13:07.242 --> 13:10.109
What, you think my stomach's
too old to take it?

13:10.512 --> 13:13.003
You're going to tell me
how to eat now, too?

13:13.181 --> 13:15.979
l didn't mean it like that.
l was just kiddin'.

13:16.218 --> 13:18.209
Some things aren't funny.

13:18.720 --> 13:20.085
Sorry, dom.

13:21.690 --> 13:24.124
Okay. Accepted.

13:28.163 --> 13:30.723
What are you doin' here
at this hour?

13:31.366 --> 13:33.027
l changed my mind.

13:33.335 --> 13:35.633
About what? The stunt?

13:36.304 --> 13:37.293
Yeah.

13:39.374 --> 13:41.103
[airplane hovering]

13:42.310 --> 13:44.403

13:45.046 --> 13:46.035
[laughs]

13:46.414 --> 13:49.281
Ahhh, l knew
you'd come around.

13:50.685 --> 13:54.143
Now, now, String,
this stunt is not
as tough as it seems.

13:54.222 --> 13:56.690
All we need is a quarter-mile
of straight road

13:56.758 --> 13:59.625
and for the truck
to go a steady 60, right?

13:59.694 --> 14:03.061
Now, l'll make
a flying approach
lined up on the road.

14:03.131 --> 14:06.123
The critical part
is the last 6 inches.

14:06.201 --> 14:08.897
You'll call them up
from the camera ship. Huh?

14:08.970 --> 14:11.803
Once l touch down,
we're rich.

14:11.873 --> 14:12.862
[laughing]

14:15.777 --> 14:18.803
What's the matter?
Oh. Oh, l forgot.

14:18.880 --> 14:20.871
You don't know from rich, huh?

14:24.319 --> 14:26.787
dom, l meant
l'd fly the stunt for you.

14:37.332 --> 14:39.357
Hey, come on, dom,
why are you bein'
so stubborn?

14:39.434 --> 14:42.494
Because l'm not an old man
ready for the rocking chair!

14:42.570 --> 14:44.470
l'm a pilot and a good one.

14:44.539 --> 14:46.268
l taught you, remember?

14:46.508 --> 14:47.566
Yeah.

14:49.277 --> 14:51.575
You taught me
how to survive, too.

14:52.013 --> 14:54.709
Evidently, l didn't
teach you well enough.

14:54.783 --> 14:57.115
Because you're
still standin' there.

14:57.852 --> 14:58.978
Hey, dom...

14:59.988 --> 15:01.649
l mean it, String!

15:21.576 --> 15:22.634
(Archangel)
l was on my way

15:22.711 --> 15:24.702
to an international conference
on terrorism

15:24.779 --> 15:26.371
and you get me here
for this?

15:26.448 --> 15:29.315
dominic means a lot more
to me than a ''this.''

15:29.384 --> 15:30.373
Okay.

15:31.553 --> 15:33.384
Grounding his
entire operation

15:33.455 --> 15:35.218
just so that
he won't fly a stunt

15:35.290 --> 15:37.315
could be considered
overkill.

15:37.392 --> 15:39.383
Yeah, and if he crashes,
you call it underkill?

15:39.461 --> 15:41.486
You sure you're not
bein' overprotective?

15:41.563 --> 15:44.999
No. Listen, at his age,
his refleXes have
slowed enough

15:45.066 --> 15:47.398
that a stunt like this
just could kill him.

15:47.469 --> 15:50.063
l could get the FAA
to pull his license.

15:50.271 --> 15:51.738
[clock dinging]

15:52.040 --> 15:53.871
That would kill him
a whole lot quicker.

15:53.942 --> 15:55.705
do you want my help
or don't you?

15:55.777 --> 15:58.940
Yeah, l want your help,
but not
by pullin' his ticket.

15:59.014 --> 16:01.312
There's got to be
some other way.

16:01.449 --> 16:03.576
You sure don't make it easy.

16:03.785 --> 16:06.185
Well, that's why l called
for the best.

16:06.554 --> 16:07.919
[chuckling]

16:07.989 --> 16:11.049
Please, Hawke,
don't try flattery.

16:11.126 --> 16:12.957
You do it so badly.

16:16.564 --> 16:20.557
Maybe, maybe l could get
the State to pull
the film permit

16:20.635 --> 16:23.536
just long enough
for dominic to calm down.

16:23.605 --> 16:25.630
That's a good idea. Thanks.

16:25.707 --> 16:29.199
don't be grateful
until you find out
what it's gonna cost you.

16:31.446 --> 16:32.640
What is it
going to cost me?

16:32.714 --> 16:34.341
l'll think of something.

16:34.416 --> 16:37.146
What's the name
of that production company?

16:39.921 --> 16:41.855
Bear Trap Productions.

16:42.490 --> 16:44.515
Some guy named
Philip Maurice.

16:48.930 --> 16:50.295
What's the matter?

16:50.365 --> 16:52.230
Why don't you
fly this stunt?

16:52.300 --> 16:54.268
l told you:
dominic won't let me.

16:54.335 --> 16:56.860
lt's the production
company's decision,
not dominic's.

16:56.938 --> 16:58.963
lf l fly it,
l'd lose a friend.

16:59.040 --> 17:01.031
You'd be saving his life.

17:01.176 --> 17:02.575
You said you'd help.

17:02.644 --> 17:05.135
Now you're crawfishin'
on me. How come?

17:06.314 --> 17:07.576
[grunting]

17:09.451 --> 17:11.281
Philip Maurice.

17:13.253 --> 17:16.051
He's one of
those brilliant minds
that has the ability

17:16.124 --> 17:19.616
to function totally
without conscience
in a deadly manner.

17:20.095 --> 17:23.394
He masterminded a raid
on a diamond mine
in South Africa.

17:23.464 --> 17:26.161
Hijacked uranium
from a defense plant
in England.

17:26.233 --> 17:29.294
He stole a MiG-21
from Red China.

17:29.971 --> 17:32.531
You name it,
Mr. Maurice has done it.

17:32.774 --> 17:34.799
Then every law
enforcement agency
in the world

17:34.876 --> 17:36.343
ought to be after him.

17:36.411 --> 17:38.845
Why don't you just grab him
and save us both a problem?

17:38.913 --> 17:39.902
lt's not that simple.

17:39.981 --> 17:42.006
What he's done
and what he can
be charged with

17:42.083 --> 17:44.051
are two different things.

17:44.185 --> 17:47.586
Michael, there's something
you're not telling me.

17:52.060 --> 17:56.463
1978, he offered a KGB decoder
to the highest bidder.

17:57.265 --> 17:59.233
l take it that wasn't you.

17:59.300 --> 18:01.598
No, the Russians
bought it back.

18:02.137 --> 18:03.729
You got outbid, eh?

18:04.239 --> 18:05.968
You remember Sonia?

18:07.709 --> 18:08.698
No.

18:11.346 --> 18:13.211
She'd only been with me
about a year

18:13.281 --> 18:16.375
when she went to East Berlin
to bid on that decoder.

18:16.451 --> 18:19.318
When the Russians
picked it up,
they also got her.

18:19.387 --> 18:23.756
l can't prove that
Maurice turned her over
to them, but l know he did.

18:25.126 --> 18:28.562
Just as sure as l know
the sun will rise
in the morning.

18:29.397 --> 18:31.058
l want him, Hawke.

18:32.967 --> 18:35.458
And this movie he's making
is probably a front

18:35.537 --> 18:37.698
for somethin'
l can nail him on.

18:37.772 --> 18:39.865
You know
what you're asking me?

18:41.576 --> 18:44.374
lf her name were Gabrielle
instead of Sonia,

18:45.513 --> 18:47.413
what would you do then?

18:51.085 --> 18:52.746
l'll let you know.

19:06.234 --> 19:08.259
(Dominic)
What, are you sayin'
I can't do it?

19:08.336 --> 19:10.304
You think I'm washed up?

19:16.644 --> 19:19.044
(Hawke)
At his age, his reflexes
have slowed enough

19:19.113 --> 19:21.809
that a stunt like this
just could kill him.

19:26.187 --> 19:29.020
(Dominic)
I'm flyin' this stunt
with or without you.

19:32.060 --> 19:34.722
I'm not an old man
ready for the rockin' chair!

19:34.796 --> 19:36.764
I'm a pilot
and a good one.

19:41.035 --> 19:44.061
(Hawke)
There's no way I'm going to
undercut Dominic.

19:44.906 --> 19:47.238
(Maurice)
Even if you could
save his life?

19:47.775 --> 19:49.936
(Sayes)
You'll fly the stunt?

19:50.011 --> 19:51.740
(Hawke)
That's what l said.

19:52.146 --> 19:54.580
Mr. Maurice will be
very pleased.

19:54.983 --> 19:56.746
l'd like to see him.

19:56.985 --> 19:59.749
He's out of town right now,
but l can sign the agreement.

19:59.821 --> 20:01.789
There's nothin' to sign.

20:02.523 --> 20:05.583
l'll do the flyin',
you pay Santini Air.

20:09.163 --> 20:10.425
[laughing]

20:12.333 --> 20:16.201
Why do l get the feeling
Mr. Santini knows
nothing about this?

20:16.504 --> 20:20.338
l don't know,
but whatever the reason,
it's none of your business.

20:24.312 --> 20:25.973
Okay, no problem.

20:26.447 --> 20:29.177
So when and where
are we gonna
shoot this stunt?

20:30.051 --> 20:32.884
We'll be filming
on several locations
around the world.

20:32.954 --> 20:37.448
Your sequence will be shot
in Northern California
within five days.

20:38.826 --> 20:40.453
When and where, eXactly?

20:40.528 --> 20:42.291
What difference does it make?

20:42.363 --> 20:46.891
Wind, weather,
atmospheric conditions,
fuel supply, spare parts.

20:47.368 --> 20:49.666
Not your problem,
we'll handle it.

20:49.737 --> 20:52.570
l'd like to know eXactly
how you're handling that.

20:53.508 --> 20:55.806
This isn't our
first production.

20:57.612 --> 20:59.079
Mine, either.

21:04.652 --> 21:07.587
l'll get you a copy
of your action sequence

21:08.089 --> 21:09.522
and l'll get in touch
with you

21:09.590 --> 21:12.684
about the rest of the details
in the morning, okay?

21:13.928 --> 21:15.020
Yeah.

21:32.814 --> 21:36.978
Mr. Santini, this is Sayes
from Bear Trap Productions.

21:57.605 --> 21:59.698
¢Ü¢Ü[classical music
playing on stereo]

22:06.514 --> 22:08.505
l didn't eXpect it from you.

22:09.083 --> 22:10.311
Not you.

22:11.953 --> 22:14.581
[sighing]
l'm sorry, dom,
l had to do it.

22:14.856 --> 22:17.381
To make me feel
like a useless old man?

22:18.126 --> 22:20.094
Well, that's not why
l'm doin' it.

22:20.161 --> 22:22.129
Oh, you got a better reason?

22:22.463 --> 22:24.090
Yeah, if you'll listen.

22:24.165 --> 22:26.030
Oh, l'm all ears.

22:30.405 --> 22:32.373
Archangel knows Maurice.

22:32.707 --> 22:33.867
He's a killer
and a thief.

22:33.941 --> 22:37.001
He's pulled off dozens
of hi-tech robberies
all over the world.

22:37.078 --> 22:40.377
His movie stunt
is probably a cover
for another caper.

22:41.282 --> 22:42.544
Archangel wants
to nail him.

22:42.617 --> 22:44.278
He asked if l'd help.

22:44.452 --> 22:45.441
[sighs]

22:47.789 --> 22:50.485
l'm supposed to believe
this fairy tale?

22:51.426 --> 22:52.950
dom, it's the truth.

22:53.327 --> 22:54.885
Okay, supposing it is,

22:54.962 --> 22:57.362
then why are you
still flying this stunt
instead of me?

22:57.432 --> 22:59.662
l told you.
Archangel asked me to help.

22:59.734 --> 23:01.099
Then do it
from the ground.

23:01.169 --> 23:03.160
Probably give you
a better position, anyway.

23:03.237 --> 23:04.670
damn it,
we've been through this.

23:04.739 --> 23:06.206
Yes, we have.

23:06.340 --> 23:08.934
You think l'm over the hill,
ready for the boneyard.

23:09.010 --> 23:10.841
No, l just think
this one particular stunt

23:10.912 --> 23:13.073
might be just
a little too risky.

23:13.147 --> 23:15.980
And if l can't cut it,
then l want to know.

23:16.184 --> 23:18.015
Even if it kills you?

23:19.320 --> 23:20.548
Yeah, kid.

23:21.422 --> 23:23.185
Even if it kills me.

23:23.758 --> 23:24.918
Look, dom--

23:24.992 --> 23:25.981
[grunts]

23:27.728 --> 23:29.855
Come on. Come on.

23:30.465 --> 23:33.434
Won't you even fight me
like l'm still a man?

23:54.589 --> 23:55.783
[screeching]

23:59.193 --> 24:01.991
(Archangel)
So now you're to land
a raiding party on the boXcar

24:02.063 --> 24:03.758
of a moving train,

24:03.831 --> 24:05.458
cut a hole in the roof,

24:05.533 --> 24:07.763
rescue the girl,
and then take off

24:07.835 --> 24:10.269
to the strains
of a symphony orchestra?

24:12.740 --> 24:14.105
Yeah, l know.

24:15.309 --> 24:17.937
Sounds like a bad
TV movie to me, too.

24:18.012 --> 24:21.175
Or the perfect cover for
The Great Train Robbery.

24:21.349 --> 24:23.749
What is it that could
be shipped by a train

24:23.818 --> 24:26.514
that would be worth
all Maurice's efforts?

24:26.587 --> 24:29.078
Well, not everything
goes by plane, Hawke.

24:29.156 --> 24:30.748
There's still
a whole world out there

24:30.825 --> 24:33.259
in constant contact
with the ground.

24:33.327 --> 24:36.660
Precious metals,
computer parts, weapons,

24:36.731 --> 24:38.790
cash transfers, art.

24:38.866 --> 24:40.663
lt could be any one
of a thousand things.

24:40.735 --> 24:43.761
So what you're sayin'
is it could be somethin'
shipped by a train

24:43.838 --> 24:46.033
in the neXt five days
through the
San Joaquin valley.

24:46.107 --> 24:47.597
l'm afraid so.

24:47.975 --> 24:50.808
l could run a computer check
on all government shipments,

24:50.878 --> 24:53.142
but that would still
leave out corporate transfers

24:53.214 --> 24:54.545
and private citizens.

24:54.615 --> 24:55.843
lt's a start.

25:09.030 --> 25:10.827
And what's wrong now?

25:11.165 --> 25:13.190
l can't use
the Firm's computers.

25:13.267 --> 25:15.167
The committee would
find out what l'm up to

25:15.236 --> 25:17.431
and want to take
over the operation.

25:18.372 --> 25:20.272
Maybe that's not
such a bad idea.

25:20.341 --> 25:22.138
No, for two reasons.

25:22.209 --> 25:23.801
ln the past,
Maurice has always

25:23.878 --> 25:25.846
been able to catch on
to our operations.

25:25.913 --> 25:28.347
l think he has a tap
inside the Firm.

25:28.416 --> 25:30.145
You said two reasons.

25:31.118 --> 25:32.983
l want him personally.

25:33.254 --> 25:35.814
Besides,
l've thought of another way
to get the information.

25:35.890 --> 25:39.451
A little risky, perhaps,
but l'm sure it will work.

25:39.927 --> 25:43.363
You know, you blow this,
the committee is gonna
bust your butt.

25:43.864 --> 25:48.028
There's not much use
for eX-deputy directors
on the street these days.

25:48.569 --> 25:52.027
Well, l can always
buy an ice-cream truck
with one headlight.

25:55.743 --> 25:57.142
[cars honking]

26:11.792 --> 26:13.817
Here's the final schedule.

26:23.838 --> 26:26.033
l've done it all, sweetheart.

26:26.374 --> 26:29.537
l've shot film
in every part of this world,

26:31.278 --> 26:34.145
under every
possible condition.

26:35.182 --> 26:37.878
did you direct
any of the famous stars?

26:38.819 --> 26:41.287
All of them,
at one time or another.

26:41.922 --> 26:43.184
Like who?

26:43.357 --> 26:44.517
Flynn.

26:45.760 --> 26:46.920
Wayne.

26:48.396 --> 26:49.556
Fonda.

26:49.630 --> 26:50.619
[both laugh]

26:50.698 --> 26:52.097
All of them.

26:53.467 --> 26:55.094
That's wonderful.

26:55.369 --> 26:57.894
Who's in the picture
you're making now?

26:58.205 --> 26:59.763
Unknowns.

27:02.743 --> 27:04.608
l'm creating new ones.

27:06.781 --> 27:08.373
lnto stars?

27:09.083 --> 27:10.380
[laughing]

27:11.585 --> 27:13.246
lnto millionaires.

27:13.854 --> 27:15.321
[both laughing]

27:16.390 --> 27:18.722
Oh, you're just fabulous,
Mr. Sayes.

27:18.793 --> 27:19.782
Hey, hey.

27:21.629 --> 27:23.187
Call me Simon.

27:23.431 --> 27:24.659
[chuckles]

27:25.900 --> 27:29.267
Tell me some more
about the picture
you're making now.

27:29.970 --> 27:31.062
(Archangel)
Tons of it.

27:31.138 --> 27:34.107
The treasury department
transfers it every year
at this time

27:34.175 --> 27:36.905
from regional depositories
to Fort KnoX.

27:37.144 --> 27:38.441
By train?

27:38.512 --> 27:40.844
Train, plane,
truck, whatever.

27:40.915 --> 27:43.383
lt's low-profile
versus show-of-force.

27:43.451 --> 27:45.442
different type of security,
but it works.

27:45.519 --> 27:47.282
Government's been
using it for years.

27:47.354 --> 27:49.254
They've got it down
to an effective system.

27:49.323 --> 27:51.382
Obviously, so does Maurice.

27:51.459 --> 27:53.017
(Archangel)
l told you he was good.

27:53.094 --> 27:56.222
There are siX train shipments
scheduled out
in the neXt four days

27:56.297 --> 27:59.994
that touch on that
500-mile fuel radius
you specified, Mr. Hawke.

28:00.401 --> 28:03.131
Now Sayes dropped
the name Stoner,
we're checking him out.

28:03.204 --> 28:04.796
lf he works on
one of those runs

28:04.872 --> 28:07.636
or is a dispatcher,
he's their inside man.

28:07.708 --> 28:11.109
lt might tell us
which train Maurice
is planning to hit.

28:11.412 --> 28:13.346
209 out of Bakersfield.

28:13.414 --> 28:15.848
They're all possibilities,
Mr. Hawke. l mean, that is,

28:15.916 --> 28:18.384
unless you possess
some sort of ESP.

28:18.619 --> 28:22.111
No. l possess
a 4:00 a.m. call.

28:22.189 --> 28:24.987
That's the only gold train
out of Bakersfield.

28:26.994 --> 28:29.155
l'll arrange
for air surveillance
and a strike force.

28:29.230 --> 28:33.758
No. Every time
l've set a trap for Maurice,
he's managed to slip it.

28:33.834 --> 28:37.167
l have to limit knowledge
of this operation
to the people in this room,

28:37.238 --> 28:39.001
at least until
he hits the train.

28:39.073 --> 28:40.404
We'll fly cover.

28:40.474 --> 28:42.032
No offense.

28:43.544 --> 28:45.375
l've got someone else
in mind.

28:45.446 --> 28:46.470
Who?

28:49.483 --> 28:51.178
(Hawke)
You're up late.

28:53.654 --> 28:56.020
That's what it takes
to run a business.

29:00.961 --> 29:02.485
What's wrong with it?

29:02.830 --> 29:04.457
Anything over 1 20 knots,

29:04.532 --> 29:08.093
she starts to vibrate
like a Hotel Street chippie.

29:10.070 --> 29:11.537
Hotel Street?

29:12.773 --> 29:14.138
Honolulu.

29:14.775 --> 29:18.836
Where l once flew combat
with your father.

29:18.913 --> 29:20.380
ln World War ll, remember?

29:20.481 --> 29:21.914
Yeah, l remember.

29:22.349 --> 29:23.976
What do you want?

29:24.685 --> 29:27.415
l want to talk,
not duck punches.

29:27.755 --> 29:29.518
Are you gonna listen?

29:29.590 --> 29:31.922
To what,
a list of old age homes?

29:32.560 --> 29:34.187
l need your help.

29:34.829 --> 29:37.525
To gas your chopper,
wash your windows?

29:38.332 --> 29:40.357
To back me up on this job.

29:40.701 --> 29:43.932
l'm not gonna
follow you around
with a fuel truck either.

29:45.105 --> 29:46.902
How about an Airwolf?

30:19.039 --> 30:20.131
(Sayes)
All set?

30:20.207 --> 30:21.333
Yeah.

30:21.542 --> 30:24.238
As soon as your
little army here
unloads their weapons.

30:24.311 --> 30:25.835
They're blanks.

30:26.280 --> 30:28.942
lf one goes off,
it'll still start a fire.

30:29.016 --> 30:30.483
They got 'em
on safety.

30:30.551 --> 30:33.520
Good. Unload 'em.

30:37.925 --> 30:39.552
[guns unloading]

31:05.886 --> 31:07.444
[eagle screeching]

31:18.799 --> 31:20.164
Oh, thanks.

31:21.568 --> 31:23.035
We could fly cover,
too, sir.

31:23.103 --> 31:25.367
Hawke wouldn't know
until it was over.

31:25.673 --> 31:26.662
No.

31:27.408 --> 31:30.935
He risked losing
his only friend
to do this job for me.

31:31.278 --> 31:34.111
l've got to let him
play it out on his terms.

31:34.648 --> 31:37.139
l thought you and Hawke
were friends.

31:37.651 --> 31:39.050
Hawke and l?

31:39.186 --> 31:40.414
[chuckles]

31:40.888 --> 31:43.755
No, we just use each other.

31:44.792 --> 31:47.659
l wouldn't call us friends.

31:48.862 --> 31:50.090
No, sir.

31:50.331 --> 31:51.320
[chuckles]

32:04.979 --> 32:07.140
Is that the track
our train's on?

32:09.650 --> 32:11.845
[laughing]
Yeah, that's it.

32:22.896 --> 32:24.454
[wind blowing]

32:48.756 --> 32:51.418
Okay, baby.
lt's just you and me.

32:54.294 --> 32:55.591
[beeping]

33:01.602 --> 33:03.263
[engine starting]

33:08.275 --> 33:10.038
[engine accelerating]

33:59.093 --> 34:01.220
There's a train
about 10 miles down there.

34:01.295 --> 34:02.887
Is that the one?

34:03.430 --> 34:05.227
[laughing]
That's the one.

34:06.500 --> 34:08.195
Where's the camera ship?

34:10.404 --> 34:12.395
[laughing]
''Where's the camera ship?''

34:13.873 --> 34:15.239
What's so funny?

34:15.442 --> 34:17.205
[Sayes continues laughing]

34:17.344 --> 34:20.643
Mr. Sayes has
a very juvenile
sense of humor, Mr. Hawke.

34:21.380 --> 34:23.246
Drop down 50 feet

34:23.484 --> 34:26.043
and fly a heading of 180.

34:26.820 --> 34:28.344
Now, Mr. Hawke.

34:37.764 --> 34:39.925
(Archangel)
Dominic, do you read me?

34:40.000 --> 34:41.399
Loud and clear.

34:41.467 --> 34:43.663
You didn't report
on station.

34:43.837 --> 34:45.168
I'm sorry.

34:45.239 --> 34:47.900
I didn't know I was
still in the military.

34:47.975 --> 34:49.966
Do you have them
in sight?

34:50.409 --> 34:53.072
Negative.
But I got the train spotted.

34:53.380 --> 34:54.972
They should be there
by now.

34:55.047 --> 34:56.481
Well, they're not.

34:57.184 --> 34:59.311
Are you sure
it's the right train?

35:15.702 --> 35:17.829
did he really call you that?

35:29.616 --> 35:31.777
There it is.
Right on time.

35:34.922 --> 35:37.049
(Sayes)
That's your target,
Mr. Hawke.

35:40.360 --> 35:43.386
(Hawke)
If he slows down or speeds up,
we'll all be dead.

35:43.463 --> 35:45.294
Then let's hope
he doesn't.

35:47.367 --> 35:50.461
(Stoner)
Express One, this is Stoner.
You still on schedule?

35:50.537 --> 35:51.526
That's a 10-4.

35:51.605 --> 35:53.232
Just entered
the Mojave straightaway.

35:54.474 --> 35:57.910
(Stoner)
l wasn't sure. Our speedometer
here shows you're down to 42.

35:57.978 --> 36:01.072
You know your alarm goes off
at 40 miles an hour.

36:01.248 --> 36:04.581
(driver)
Something's wrong.
My speedometer is reading 55.

36:04.651 --> 36:07.347
Probably needs recalibration.
l'll tell you what.

36:07.421 --> 36:10.015
Why don't you nail it to 60
for the neXt couple of minutes

36:10.090 --> 36:11.682
and hold it steady?

36:11.758 --> 36:13.020
That's a 10-4.

37:59.599 --> 38:00.827
Okay, boys.

38:05.472 --> 38:06.905
They've got to be there.

38:06.973 --> 38:09.942
(Dominic)
Well, come up here
and see for yourself.

38:10.777 --> 38:13.211
Sir, Stoner isn't
with any railroad.

38:13.280 --> 38:15.111
Meryl, we've got
a slightly larger problem

38:15.182 --> 38:17.582
than locating
Maurice's inside man.

38:18.018 --> 38:21.419
But, sir, he is a dispatcher
with Hi-desert Trucking.

38:21.788 --> 38:24.450
They ship gold
for the government, too.

38:44.244 --> 38:46.075
I got her, Mr. Maurice.

38:46.413 --> 38:48.938
Then we no longer
need you, Mr. Hawke.

38:55.722 --> 38:56.950
[firing]

39:00.494 --> 39:01.984
He's got to be dead.

39:02.596 --> 39:05.793
don't worry.
l can fly her off of here.

39:06.633 --> 39:08.863
l'm bettin' our lives
on that, Vinnie.

39:30.624 --> 39:32.683
(Archangel)
You've got
to get there faster.

39:32.759 --> 39:35.023
I'm flying her
as fast as I can.

39:35.562 --> 39:37.325
What's your air speed,
dominic?

39:37.397 --> 39:38.921
(Dominic)
250 knots.

39:38.999 --> 39:41.263
He's not using
the turbo thrusters.

39:41.334 --> 39:43.859
He can't,
he'd never be able
to control Airwolf.

39:44.738 --> 39:47.206
Oh, what the hell,
you only live once.

41:07.454 --> 41:10.218
Well, you sure took
your sweet time getting here.

41:10.290 --> 41:14.056
Sweet time?
Ha. You're lucky
I got here at all.

41:14.594 --> 41:17.085
You were supposed
to be robbin' a railroad,
remember?

41:17.163 --> 41:20.326
If Archangel hadn't
found out about some guy
named Stoner

41:20.400 --> 41:23.096
working for
Hi-Desert Trucking Company,

41:23.503 --> 41:25.994
I'd still be followin'
a train to Bakersfield.

41:26.106 --> 41:27.095
Hey, Dom.

41:27.874 --> 41:28.863
Yeah?

41:29.276 --> 41:30.743
Nice landing.

41:32.746 --> 41:33.735
Hmm.

41:37.284 --> 41:39.946
Give me full power,
both turbos.

41:40.086 --> 41:41.713
We got some
catching up to do.

41:41.788 --> 41:43.255
[beeping]
You got it.

41:51.464 --> 41:53.432
(Vinnie)
That's it, Mr. Maurice.

41:53.500 --> 41:55.832
We can't lift off
with any more.

41:56.102 --> 42:00.232
Vinnie, how much do Sayes
and Miller weigh?

42:00.307 --> 42:02.002
About 8 to 10 bars.

42:02.275 --> 42:03.936
Let's make it 10.

42:09.950 --> 42:11.850
I got a blip 5 miles ahead.

42:17.057 --> 42:18.615
Just a few more minutes, guys

42:18.692 --> 42:20.717
and you can pull over
to the side of the road

42:20.794 --> 42:23.058
of the road and throw up
if you want to.

42:23.129 --> 42:24.118
[laughing]

42:28.935 --> 42:30.926
Hey! Hey, you can't
leave me here!

42:31.404 --> 42:32.803
[screaming]

42:36.109 --> 42:38.600
I believe Mr. Sayes
had an accident, Vinnie.

42:39.045 --> 42:40.034
[laughing]

42:48.622 --> 42:49.987
[beeping]

42:57.564 --> 43:00.795
Aren't you gonna
notify the authorities,
Mr. Stoner?

43:07.340 --> 43:09.240
Two minutes
ahead of schedule.

43:09.776 --> 43:13.371
Very nice.
Very nice, indeed.

43:20.453 --> 43:22.080
What the hell was that?

43:24.524 --> 43:26.389
You want chain guns?

43:26.459 --> 43:27.551
No.

43:33.033 --> 43:34.022
Vinnie!

43:47.514 --> 43:48.845
[firing]

44:14.607 --> 44:16.939
He's crazy!
He's going to kill us.

44:19.379 --> 44:20.812
Do something.

44:20.880 --> 44:22.643
Sure, I will.
I've had enough.

44:28.455 --> 44:30.582
Give me the chain guns. Now.

44:31.191 --> 44:32.522
Hawke, you can't.

44:32.959 --> 44:34.221
Chain guns.

44:39.365 --> 44:40.764
You got it.

45:57.043 --> 45:58.305
Come on!

46:05.652 --> 46:07.483
String, don't do it.

46:15.895 --> 46:17.362
No!

46:18.364 --> 46:19.626
Please don't!

46:20.800 --> 46:22.290
That's enough!

46:41.754 --> 46:46.521
Michael, I've got Maurice
and a friend, packaged
and ready for you.

46:46.593 --> 46:47.617
(Archangel)
Good job.

46:47.694 --> 46:49.958
Shall I pick 'em up,
or will you bring 'em in?

46:50.029 --> 46:52.190
We only gift-wrap.
We don't deliver.

47:02.375 --> 47:05.037
What's the rush?
Too much for you?

47:06.145 --> 47:07.908
Supposed to be eXercise.

47:07.981 --> 47:09.710
We already had the war.

47:09.782 --> 47:12.751
Come on, come on,
this old man ain't done yet.

47:14.287 --> 47:16.312
did l ever call you that?

47:16.923 --> 47:19.153
No, but you made me
feel like it.

47:20.093 --> 47:21.526
Now, dom,

47:22.495 --> 47:24.793
you made yourself
feel like that.

47:25.198 --> 47:26.187
Uh?

47:26.933 --> 47:29.163
What, are you
quittin' on me?

47:29.269 --> 47:30.497
Maybe.

47:31.404 --> 47:32.701
And maybe not.

47:32.772 --> 47:34.034
[laughing]

47:36.509 --> 47:38.272
You know, dominic,

47:39.245 --> 47:41.770
you've always
been younger than me.
