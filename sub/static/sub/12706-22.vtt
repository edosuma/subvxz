WEBVTT

00:01.569 --> 00:03.803
BUFFY:
 The Initiative created this
 thing and they can't stop it.

00:03.836 --> 00:06.807
But we will.
 Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:06.839 --> 00:09.143
WILLOW: The power of the slayer
and all who wield it.

00:09.176 --> 00:12.012
Last to ancient first,
we invoke thee.

00:12.045 --> 00:14.548
Make us mind
and heart and spirit join.

00:14.582 --> 00:16.350
Spiritus, the spirit.

00:16.384 --> 00:18.152
Animus, heart.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.486
Sophus, mind.

00:19.519 --> 00:21.054
And manus, the hand.

00:21.088 --> 00:22.522
BUFFY:
 You could never hope to grasp

00:22.556 --> 00:24.257
the source of our power.

00:24.292 --> 00:25.593
(grunts)

00:29.362 --> 00:32.500
(wolf howling)

00:32.533 --> 00:35.034
*

01:21.781 --> 01:23.584
Are you sure
you'll be all right?

01:23.617 --> 01:25.585
'Cause I can be there
in the morning.

01:25.618 --> 01:26.986
It's just a debriefing.

01:27.019 --> 01:28.555
They're not gonna
make me disappear

01:28.588 --> 01:30.424
and they're not pinning
anything on me.

01:30.457 --> 01:32.325
I got Graham and
a lot of the guys

01:32.359 --> 01:34.495
testifying I'm the
reason they're alive.

01:34.527 --> 01:36.829
I might actually get out of this
with an honorable discharge.

01:36.864 --> 01:38.899
In return for
your silence, no doubt.

01:38.932 --> 01:41.001
Oh, yeah. Having
the inside scoop

01:41.033 --> 01:42.802
on the administration's
own Bay of Mutated Pigs

01:42.835 --> 01:44.572
is definitely an advantage.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.873
It's like you're blackmailing
the government.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.610
In a... patriotic way.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.612
I'll call you when it's over.

01:54.014 --> 01:55.348
XANDER: Dinner is served.

01:55.383 --> 01:57.418
And my very own recipe.

01:57.450 --> 01:59.520
Ooh. You pushed the button
on the microwave

01:59.552 --> 02:00.921
that says "popcorn"?

02:00.953 --> 02:02.256
Actually, I pushed defrost,

02:02.290 --> 02:04.825
but um, Joyce was there
in the clinch.

02:04.858 --> 02:06.527
Well, you guys
have fun tonight.

02:06.560 --> 02:07.995
It was very nice
meeting you.

02:08.026 --> 02:10.163
It was nice
meeting you. Finally.

02:11.498 --> 02:13.501
Bye.
Bye.

02:15.402 --> 02:18.506
Did you notice how pointedly
I said "finally"?

02:18.538 --> 02:20.139
No.

02:21.841 --> 02:24.512
Let the vidfest begin.

02:24.545 --> 02:26.013
You sure you
won't join us?

02:26.045 --> 02:27.781
No. You guys
have your fun.

02:27.814 --> 02:30.050
I'm tired. I can't believe
you're not exhausted.

02:30.082 --> 02:31.951
Have you
even slept since...

02:31.985 --> 02:33.721
Still feel a little bit
too wired.

02:33.753 --> 02:35.355
Mmm. Yeah, that spell--

02:35.389 --> 02:37.290
that was... that was powerful.

02:37.324 --> 02:38.658
Don't think I could sleep.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.493
Well, we got
plenty of vid.

02:40.527 --> 02:42.295
And I'm putting in
a preemptive bid

02:42.329 --> 02:43.663
for Apocalypse Now,
huh?

02:43.697 --> 02:44.897
Did you get anything

02:44.932 --> 02:46.800
less heart of darknessy?

02:46.834 --> 02:48.401
XANDER: Apocalypse Now
is a gay romp.

02:48.436 --> 02:50.304
It's the feel-good movie
of whatever year it was.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.538
What else?

02:51.572 --> 02:53.039
Don't worry--

02:53.073 --> 02:54.974
got plenty of chick and
British guy flicks, too.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.545
These puppies should
last us all night.

03:14.228 --> 03:16.229
(snorts)

03:25.104 --> 03:27.106
*

03:42.590 --> 03:44.957
I think it's strange.

03:46.426 --> 03:47.795
I mean...

03:47.828 --> 03:49.228
I think I should worry

03:49.263 --> 03:52.199
that we haven't
found her name.

03:52.231 --> 03:54.602
Who, Miss Kitty?

03:57.437 --> 03:59.906
TARA:
You'd think she'd let us
know her name by now.

03:59.939 --> 04:01.942
She will.

04:01.974 --> 04:04.578
She's not all grown yet.

04:04.611 --> 04:06.112
You're not worried?

04:06.145 --> 04:09.049
I never worry here.

04:09.081 --> 04:12.218
I'm safe here.

04:12.252 --> 04:15.622
You don't know
everything about me.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.925
Have you told me
your real name?

04:20.427 --> 04:22.028
Oh, you know that.

04:28.502 --> 04:30.269
They will find out,
you know.

04:33.374 --> 04:35.442
About you.

04:37.009 --> 04:40.112
I don't have time
to think about that.

04:40.146 --> 04:43.182
You know I have
all this homework to finish.

04:44.384 --> 04:46.920
Are you gonna finish
in time for class?

04:46.954 --> 04:49.956
I can be late.

04:49.990 --> 04:53.259
But you've never
taken drama before.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.329
Might miss
something important.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.834
I don't want
to leave here.

05:03.403 --> 05:05.038
Why not?

05:13.146 --> 05:15.382
It's so bright.

05:18.351 --> 05:20.353
And there's something out there.

05:34.735 --> 05:36.202
Hey.
Hey, guys.

05:36.235 --> 05:37.637
Heard you're taking drama.

05:37.670 --> 05:38.872
Uh-huh.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.408
It's a tough course.

05:40.441 --> 05:41.742
You took it?

05:41.774 --> 05:43.310
Oh, I've been here forever.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.577
So what you
been doing?

05:44.612 --> 05:46.514
Doing spells?

05:46.547 --> 05:48.081
She does spells
with Tara.

05:48.115 --> 05:49.850
Yeah, I heard about that.

05:49.882 --> 05:51.918
(school bell rings)

05:51.951 --> 05:53.553
I'm gonna be late.

05:55.355 --> 05:58.425
Sometimes I think about
two women doing a spell.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.593
And then I do a spell by myself.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.499
(indistinct conversations)

06:05.533 --> 06:06.934
(orchestra tuning up)

06:13.807 --> 06:15.809
Could you help me
with my Spanish?
Oh, sure.

06:18.812 --> 06:21.180
Isn't this exciting?
Our first production.

06:21.213 --> 06:22.449
I can't wait till our scene.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.451
I love you. Oh.

06:24.485 --> 06:26.687
Don't step on my cues.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.120
Production?

06:28.154 --> 06:30.723
Oh, my God.
The place is packed.

06:30.757 --> 06:32.225
Everybody's here.
Your whole family's

06:32.259 --> 06:34.528
in the front row
and they look really angry.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.062
There's a production?

06:36.096 --> 06:38.197
Oh, somebody's
got stage fright.

06:38.230 --> 06:40.533
Isn't this the first class?

06:40.567 --> 06:43.269
Well, you showed up late,
or you'd have a better part.

06:43.302 --> 06:45.072
I'm Cowboy Guy.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.074
Your costume
is perfect.

06:47.106 --> 06:48.776
(whispers):
Nobody's gonna know the truth.

06:48.808 --> 06:50.076
You know, about you.

06:50.110 --> 06:51.478
Costume?

06:51.512 --> 06:53.379
You're already in character.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.449
Oh, I should've done that.

06:56.483 --> 06:58.084
But how come there's...

06:58.117 --> 06:59.752
I mean, I was given
to understand

06:59.786 --> 07:02.021
that a drama class
would have, you know...

07:02.923 --> 07:04.124
drama class.

07:04.156 --> 07:05.826
We haven't even rehearsed.

07:05.858 --> 07:07.661
HARMONY:
(scoffs) Well, maybe
some people haven't.

07:07.694 --> 07:11.564
I showed up on time, so
I got to be Cowboy Guy.

07:11.598 --> 07:14.668
I just think it's really early
to be putting on a play.

07:14.701 --> 07:16.737
I-I don't even know what...

07:16.769 --> 07:18.437
this isn't
 Madame Butterfly, is it?

07:18.471 --> 07:20.106
Because I have
a whole problem with opera.

07:20.139 --> 07:23.677
GILES: All right, everyone.
Pay attention.
(claps)

07:23.711 --> 07:26.012
In just a few moments,
that curtain is going to open

07:26.045 --> 07:27.680
on our very first production.

07:27.714 --> 07:29.750
Everyone that
Willow's ever met

07:29.783 --> 07:31.819
is out in that audience,
including all of us.

07:31.851 --> 07:33.687
That means we have
to be perfect.

07:33.721 --> 07:35.355
Now, stay in character,

07:35.387 --> 07:37.591
remember your lines and
energy, energy, energy.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.959
Especially in the
musical numbers.

07:39.992 --> 07:42.696
Did anyone see that?
GILES: Acting is not about
behaving, it's about hiding.

07:42.730 --> 07:45.264
The audience wants to find you,
strip you naked

07:45.298 --> 07:48.000
and eat you alive, so hide.
Stop that.

07:48.034 --> 07:49.502
Now, costumes, sets.

07:49.536 --> 07:51.437
Um, the things that you,
uh, you know, uh,

07:51.471 --> 07:54.374
you, um, you hold them, you
touch them, use them. Um...

07:54.406 --> 07:55.942
Props?
No.

07:55.975 --> 07:58.478
Props?
Yes. It's all about subterfuge.

07:58.512 --> 08:00.112
That's very annoying.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.716
Now go on out there,
lie like dogs,

08:02.750 --> 08:04.552
and have a wonderful time.
Now, if we can stay in focus,

08:04.584 --> 08:06.153
keep our heads, and if Willow

08:06.185 --> 08:07.620
can stop stepping on
everyone's cues,

08:07.654 --> 08:09.456
I know this'll be
the best production

08:09.488 --> 08:11.625
of Death of a Salesman
we've ever done. Stop it.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.894
Good luck, everyone.
Break a leg.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.928
(indistinct chatter)

08:20.500 --> 08:22.002
(chatter fades out)

08:33.346 --> 08:37.116
I've made a little space
for the cheese slices.

09:04.812 --> 09:06.947
Things aren't
going very well.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.682
No. This drama class is just...

09:09.716 --> 09:12.519
I think they're really not
doing things in the proper way,

09:12.552 --> 09:14.788
and now I'm in a play
and my whole family's out there

09:14.822 --> 09:16.188
and why is there a cowboy

09:16.222 --> 09:18.792
in Death of a Salesman anyway?

09:18.826 --> 09:20.961
You don't
understand yet, do you?

09:22.495 --> 09:25.231
Is there something following me?

09:25.264 --> 09:27.134
Yes.

09:27.167 --> 09:30.638
Well, w-what should I do?

09:30.671 --> 09:34.407
The play's gonna start soon
and I don't even know my lines.

09:34.441 --> 09:37.144
The play's already started.
That's not the point.

09:41.649 --> 09:44.652
Why, hello,
little lady.

09:44.684 --> 09:47.654
Can I hold those
milk pails for you?

09:47.687 --> 09:50.724
Why, thank you,
but they're not very heavy.

09:50.758 --> 09:53.592
Why have you come
to our lonely small town

09:53.626 --> 09:56.963
which has no post office
and very few exports?

09:56.996 --> 10:00.232
I've come looking
for a man.

10:00.267 --> 10:03.269
A salesman.

10:03.302 --> 10:05.639
Everyone's starting
to wonder about you--

10:05.673 --> 10:09.009
the real you.
If they find out,

10:09.042 --> 10:11.979
they'll punish you.
I-I can't help you with that.

10:12.011 --> 10:13.613
What should I...

10:13.647 --> 10:15.282
What's after me?

10:15.315 --> 10:17.918
I-Is it something
I was supposed to do?

10:17.951 --> 10:19.485
W-Was I supposed to...

10:19.519 --> 10:21.822
Shh.

10:21.855 --> 10:23.289
(whispering voices)

10:23.322 --> 10:25.125
What was that?

10:27.126 --> 10:29.528
What else could I expect
from a bunch of low-rent,

10:29.562 --> 10:32.298
no-account hoodlums like you?
Hoodlums, yes.

10:32.331 --> 10:34.600
I mean you and your friends,
your whole sex.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.503
Throw 'em in the sea
for all I care.

10:36.536 --> 10:38.538
Throw 'em in and wait
for the bubbles.

10:38.571 --> 10:41.207
Men, with your groping and
spitting. All groin, no brain.

10:41.240 --> 10:44.311
Three billion of you passing
around the same worn-out urge.

10:44.344 --> 10:48.248
Men, with your... sales.

10:52.052 --> 10:53.552
(whispers):
Tara?

10:55.087 --> 10:56.523
Tara, okay, this really isn't...

10:56.556 --> 10:57.825
(gasps)
(growling)

10:59.591 --> 11:01.061
(screams)

11:06.666 --> 11:07.868
Will.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.501
Buffy. Oh, God.

11:09.535 --> 11:11.604
Come on.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.642
Stay low.

11:15.674 --> 11:17.677
What did it look like?

11:17.711 --> 11:19.412
I don't know.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.548
I-I don't know
why it's after me.

11:21.581 --> 11:23.216
Well, you must have
done something.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.885
No. I-I never do anything.

11:25.918 --> 11:28.254
I'm very seldom naughty.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.057
I-I just came to class

11:30.090 --> 11:32.225
and-and the play was starting.

11:32.259 --> 11:34.661
Play is long over.

11:34.693 --> 11:36.428
Why are you still in costume?

11:36.462 --> 11:38.197
Okay, still
having to explain

11:38.230 --> 11:40.200
wherein this is
just my outfit.

11:40.232 --> 11:42.568
Willow, everybody
already knows.

11:42.601 --> 11:43.836
Take it off.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.005
No.

11:46.038 --> 11:47.941
I need it.

11:47.975 --> 11:50.911
Oh, for God's sake,
just take it off.

11:50.943 --> 11:52.879
(ripping)
That's better.

11:52.913 --> 11:54.280
It's much more realistic.

11:56.216 --> 12:00.086
See, isn't everybody
very clear on this now?

12:02.654 --> 12:04.291
Oh my God, it's like a tragedy.

12:06.326 --> 12:09.129
I tried to warn you.
(chuckles)

12:09.162 --> 12:10.697
ANYA:
It's exactly like

12:10.730 --> 12:11.697
a Greek tragedy.

12:11.730 --> 12:13.399
There should only be Greeks.

12:17.070 --> 12:20.407
"My book report.
This summer I-I read

12:20.440 --> 12:23.309
The Lion, the Witch,
 and the Wardrobe."

12:23.342 --> 12:26.745
Oh, who cares?

12:30.750 --> 12:32.952
"This book ha-has many theme."

12:32.985 --> 12:34.153
(growling)

12:34.187 --> 12:36.889
(screaming)

12:36.923 --> 12:40.393
Help me! Help me.

12:40.427 --> 12:41.928
(screaming)

12:41.961 --> 12:43.495
Help me!

12:47.835 --> 12:49.701
(gasping)

12:57.344 --> 12:59.046
(gasping)

13:00.547 --> 13:02.615
I'm awake. I'm good.

13:02.649 --> 13:03.850
Did I miss anything?

13:03.884 --> 13:05.485
Nothing much
at all, really.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.519
Bunch of massacring.

13:10.890 --> 13:14.527
We got to keep going, men.

13:14.561 --> 13:17.297
We got to take that hill.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.466
Damn this war.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.134
I have to say,

13:21.168 --> 13:24.437
I really feel Apocalypse Now
is overrated.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.673
No, no. It gets better.

13:26.706 --> 13:27.941
Men...

13:27.975 --> 13:29.976
I remember that it gets better.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.981
Oh, my God.

13:35.014 --> 13:37.116
What's happened to my men?

13:37.149 --> 13:38.451
(screams)

13:38.485 --> 13:39.852
Want some corn?

13:39.886 --> 13:41.453
Butter flavor?

13:41.488 --> 13:42.489
New car smell.

13:42.522 --> 13:43.722
Cool.

13:43.755 --> 13:44.991
(gasping)

13:45.024 --> 13:47.293
What's her deal?

13:47.326 --> 13:48.727
Big faker.

13:48.760 --> 13:50.297
Oh, I'm beginning
to understand this now.

13:50.330 --> 13:53.500
It's all about
the journey, isn't it?

13:53.533 --> 13:55.735
Well, thanks
for making me have to pee.

13:55.768 --> 13:58.205
You don't need any
help with that, right?

13:58.238 --> 14:00.072
I got a system.

14:07.679 --> 14:09.015
Hey.

14:10.216 --> 14:11.918
Hey, Joyce...

14:11.951 --> 14:14.354
Mrs. Summers.

14:14.386 --> 14:17.057
We're not making too much noise
down there, are we?

14:17.090 --> 14:18.390
Oh, no.

14:18.424 --> 14:20.894
Anyway, they all
left a while ago.

14:20.927 --> 14:23.830
Oh, I should probably
go catch up.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.765
I've heard that before.

14:26.798 --> 14:28.868
I move pretty fast.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.370
You know, a man's
always after...

14:30.403 --> 14:32.338
Conquest?

14:32.371 --> 14:35.408
I'm a conquistador.

14:36.909 --> 14:38.745
JOYCE:
 You sure it isn't comfort?

14:40.113 --> 14:42.782
I'm a comfortador also.

14:42.815 --> 14:44.716
I do know the difference.

14:44.750 --> 14:46.953
I've learned about boys.

14:46.986 --> 14:48.654
That's cool about you.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.427
JOYCE:
 It's very late.

14:54.461 --> 14:55.894
Would you like
 to rest for a while?

14:58.630 --> 15:02.568
Um, yeah, I'd like you.

15:02.601 --> 15:05.337
I'm just gonna go
to the bathroom first.

15:06.405 --> 15:07.975
Don't get lost.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.754
(zips)

15:36.102 --> 15:38.370
Okay, I'm gonna
find another bathroom.
(zips)

15:52.652 --> 15:54.653
(doorknob rattling)

15:59.025 --> 16:01.693
I didn't order any vampires.

16:06.499 --> 16:07.966
(pounding)

16:09.302 --> 16:12.004
That's not the way out.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.423
Hey, there you are.

16:31.990 --> 16:34.360
Are you sure it's us
you were looking for?

16:37.096 --> 16:38.798
Giles here
is gonna teach me

16:38.831 --> 16:42.168
to be a watcher.
Says I got the stuff.

16:42.201 --> 16:44.636
Spike's like a son to me.

16:44.671 --> 16:47.639
That's good. I was
into that for a while,

16:47.673 --> 16:51.077
but I got other stuff going on.

16:58.750 --> 17:00.753
You got to have something.

17:00.787 --> 17:03.523
got to be always moving forward.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.357
Like a shark.

17:05.392 --> 17:07.925
Like a shark with feet and...

17:07.960 --> 17:09.996
much less fins.

17:10.028 --> 17:11.498
And on land.

17:11.530 --> 17:12.798
Very good.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.269
Buffy, are you sure
you want to play there?

17:19.038 --> 17:21.208
It's a pretty big sandbox.

17:21.240 --> 17:24.576
I'm okay.
It's not coming for me yet.

17:24.611 --> 17:26.877
I just mean...

17:26.913 --> 17:29.215
you can't
protect yourself from...

17:29.249 --> 17:31.750
some stuff.

17:31.784 --> 17:34.354
I'm way ahead of you,
big brother.

17:34.386 --> 17:36.388
Brother?

17:43.296 --> 17:45.064
Come on,
put your back into it.

17:45.097 --> 17:47.299
A watcher scoffs at gravity.

18:18.365 --> 18:20.333
Do you know
where you're going?

18:23.836 --> 18:27.173
I've been thinking about
getting back into vengeance.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.242
Is that right?

18:30.277 --> 18:31.644
Well, you know how I miss it.

18:31.678 --> 18:33.980
I'm so at loose ends
since I quit.

18:34.012 --> 18:36.915
I think this is going to be
a very big year for vengeance.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.984
But isn't vengeance

18:39.018 --> 18:41.453
kind of... vengeful?

18:41.488 --> 18:43.589
You don't want me
to have a hobby.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.124
Not a vengeance hobby, no.

18:45.157 --> 18:47.160
It's dangerous.

18:47.193 --> 18:49.127
People can't
do anything they want.

18:49.162 --> 18:51.298
Society has rules and borders
and an end zone.

18:51.330 --> 18:52.865
It doesn't matter if...
(giggling)

18:55.567 --> 18:58.069
Do you mind?
I'm talking to my demon.

18:59.005 --> 19:01.140
Sorry.

19:01.173 --> 19:04.143
TARA:
 We just think you're
 really interesting.

19:04.176 --> 19:07.145
Oh, I... I'm going places.

19:07.180 --> 19:08.980
I'm way ahead of you.

19:11.049 --> 19:13.051
(giggling)

19:15.488 --> 19:17.390
Is that right?

19:19.425 --> 19:21.693
Watch this.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.498
(kissing)

19:35.173 --> 19:37.676
Do you want to come
in the back with us?

19:39.878 --> 19:42.315
Oh, go on.

19:42.348 --> 19:44.651
I don't have to.

19:44.683 --> 19:46.486
I'll be fine.
I think I've figured out

19:46.519 --> 19:48.721
how to steer
by gesturing emphatically.

20:25.258 --> 20:26.925
Girls?

20:28.994 --> 20:30.329
(doorknob rattling)

20:43.976 --> 20:45.677
(pounding)

20:47.078 --> 20:48.914
I know what's up there.

20:48.948 --> 20:50.950
(pounding)

20:55.521 --> 20:59.425
These will not protect you.

20:59.459 --> 21:01.861
(pounding)

21:03.028 --> 21:05.365
(door shatters)
(growling)

21:19.945 --> 21:21.448
Giles.

21:22.882 --> 21:24.784
Xander, what are you doing here?

21:24.817 --> 21:26.519
What's after me?

21:26.553 --> 21:29.087
It's because of what we did,
I know that.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.789
What we did?

21:30.823 --> 21:33.125
Mmm. The others
have gone on ahead.

21:33.159 --> 21:35.094
Now, listen very carefully.

21:35.126 --> 21:37.463
Your life may depend
on what I'm about to tell you.

21:37.497 --> 21:39.030
You need to...

21:39.065 --> 21:41.067
(dubbed voice speaking French)

21:46.638 --> 21:49.476
What? Go where?

21:49.509 --> 21:50.710
I don't understand.

21:50.742 --> 21:54.012
(dubbed voice speaking French)

21:54.046 --> 21:55.114
ANYA:
Xander.

21:55.146 --> 21:59.050
(dubbed voices speaking French)

21:59.085 --> 22:01.953
Honey, I don't...

22:01.988 --> 22:03.455
I can't hear you.

22:03.490 --> 22:06.125
(dubbed voices speaking French)

22:06.157 --> 22:08.126
Well... Wait.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.796
Where are we going?

22:09.828 --> 22:12.163
W-Where?

22:12.198 --> 22:15.233
Hey. Let go!

22:15.267 --> 22:17.002
(echoing):
Hey!

22:17.036 --> 22:19.038
*

22:34.886 --> 22:36.888
Where are you from, Harris?

22:38.924 --> 22:41.594
Well,
the basement mostly.

22:41.627 --> 22:44.130
Were you born there?

22:45.932 --> 22:47.700
Possibly.

22:47.733 --> 22:51.637
I walked by your guidance
counselor's office one time.

22:54.641 --> 22:57.777
A bunch of you were
sitting there...

23:00.278 --> 23:03.516
waiting to be
shepherded.

23:03.549 --> 23:05.017
I remember it
smelled like

23:05.050 --> 23:07.053
dead flowers.

23:08.788 --> 23:10.856
Like decay.

23:10.890 --> 23:14.026
Then it hit me.

23:14.059 --> 23:16.194
The hope of our nation's future

23:16.228 --> 23:19.265
is a bunch of mulch.

23:21.099 --> 23:23.102
You know, I never got
the chance to tell you

23:23.134 --> 23:25.471
how glad I was you were
eaten by a snake.

23:31.911 --> 23:34.413
Where are you
heading?

23:34.447 --> 23:37.115
Well, I'm supposed
to meet Tara and Willow.

23:40.853 --> 23:43.189
And possibly Buffy's mom.

23:47.626 --> 23:50.462
Your time is running out.

23:52.298 --> 23:55.134
No, I'm just trying to get away.

23:55.166 --> 23:57.169
There's something
I can't fight.

23:58.704 --> 24:01.272
Are you a soldier?

24:02.340 --> 24:04.544
I'm a comfortador.

24:06.444 --> 24:08.615
You're neither.

24:08.647 --> 24:11.349
You're a whipping boy,

24:11.383 --> 24:15.354
raised by mongrels
and set on a sacrificial stone.

24:19.391 --> 24:21.393
I'm getting a cramp.

24:28.233 --> 24:30.236
(growls)

24:33.506 --> 24:34.973
Giles, it's here.

24:35.007 --> 24:36.643
This is more serious
than we thought.

24:36.675 --> 24:38.309
Giles?
I can fight
anything, right?

24:38.344 --> 24:39.846
ANYA:
Maybe we should slap her.

24:44.150 --> 24:46.152
(indistinct conversations)

24:57.195 --> 24:58.530
Buffy?

24:58.565 --> 25:00.567
(growling)

25:14.180 --> 25:16.182
(pounding on door)

25:29.361 --> 25:31.363
That's not the way out.

25:33.566 --> 25:36.836
What the hell
is wrong with you?

25:36.868 --> 25:39.605
You won't come upstairs?

25:39.638 --> 25:43.509
What are you,
ashamed of us?

25:43.541 --> 25:45.376
Your mother's
crying her guts out.

25:45.411 --> 25:47.680
You don't understand.

25:47.713 --> 25:49.181
No...

25:49.214 --> 25:52.451
you don't understand.

25:52.483 --> 25:54.686
The line ends
here with us,

25:54.721 --> 25:56.255
and you're not
gonna change that.

25:56.288 --> 25:58.625
You haven't got the heart.

26:01.827 --> 26:03.162
(growling)

26:04.096 --> 26:05.964
(gasping)

26:14.641 --> 26:16.342
GILES:
You have to stop thinking.

26:18.509 --> 26:20.913
Let it wash over you.

26:20.946 --> 26:23.315
Don't you think
it's a little old-fashioned?

26:23.348 --> 26:25.217
This is the way
women and men have behaved

26:25.250 --> 26:28.954
since the beginning,
before time.

26:28.988 --> 26:30.623
Now look into the light.

26:34.526 --> 26:37.997
MAN:
Step on up, step on up.
Try your luck.

26:38.029 --> 26:41.933
Come on. Come on.

26:41.968 --> 26:43.501
We're gonna miss
all the good stuff.

26:43.535 --> 26:45.471
Does she always want
to train this badly?

26:45.503 --> 26:48.440
Well, it appears she's never
heard the fable about patience.

26:48.473 --> 26:49.808
Which one is that?

26:49.842 --> 26:51.677
Well, the one with
the fox and the, um,

26:51.711 --> 26:53.412
uh... less-patient fox.

26:53.444 --> 26:54.913
Here! I want to,
I want to!

26:54.947 --> 26:56.749
Yes, go ahead.

26:56.782 --> 26:58.017
RECORDED VOICE:
I am a vampire.

26:59.518 --> 27:01.252
Buffy, you have
a sacred birthright

27:01.287 --> 27:02.954
to protect mankind.

27:02.989 --> 27:04.891
Don't stick out your elbow.

27:07.226 --> 27:08.661
I am a vampire.

27:08.694 --> 27:11.196
Oh, you stake me.

27:11.230 --> 27:13.432
I haven't got any treats.

27:13.464 --> 27:16.067
For God's sake, Rupert,
go easy on the girl.

27:17.135 --> 27:18.436
GILES:
This is my business.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.638
Blood of the lamb and all that.

27:20.673 --> 27:23.509
G... Oh, now you're gonna
get that all over your face.

27:26.644 --> 27:28.380
GILES: I know you.

27:28.413 --> 27:30.548
I know you.

27:30.582 --> 27:32.617
SPIKE:
Hey!

27:32.651 --> 27:36.488
Come on! You're gonna
miss everything.

27:39.525 --> 27:41.861
(crying)

27:41.894 --> 27:45.131
Don't push me around. You know
I have a great deal to do.

27:45.163 --> 27:46.965
(indistinct conversations)

27:46.999 --> 27:49.836
I've hired myself out
as an attraction.

27:49.868 --> 27:50.903
(people exclaim)

27:50.936 --> 27:52.337
Sideshow freak?

27:52.371 --> 27:55.374
Well, at least
it's showbiz.

28:01.913 --> 28:04.016
What am I supposed to
do with all of this?

28:04.049 --> 28:05.683
You got to make up
your mind, Rupes.

28:05.718 --> 28:07.618
What are you wasting time for?

28:09.922 --> 28:11.990
Haven't you figured it
all out yet with your enormous

28:12.023 --> 28:13.692
squishy frontal lobes?

28:16.362 --> 28:18.196
I still think
Buffy should have killed you.

28:22.468 --> 28:26.105
I wear the cheese.
It does not wear me.

28:26.137 --> 28:28.941
Honestly, you meet the most
appalling sort of people.

28:33.945 --> 28:35.948
(indistinct conversations)

28:47.894 --> 28:49.694
I'm so sorry I'm late.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.197
There's a great deal going on,

28:51.230 --> 28:52.463
and all at once.

28:52.498 --> 28:53.865
Don't we know it.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.433
Only at death's
door over here.

28:55.467 --> 28:56.868
Look at Xander.

28:56.903 --> 28:59.204
Got the sucking
chest wound swinging.

28:59.238 --> 29:01.406
I promised Anya
I'd be there for her big night.

29:01.440 --> 29:04.242
Now I'll probably be pushing up
daisies in the sense of being

29:04.276 --> 29:05.811
in the ground underneath them
and fertilizing the soil

29:05.845 --> 29:08.047
with my decomposition.

29:08.079 --> 29:10.916
Okay. A man

29:10.950 --> 29:13.551
walks into the office
of a doctor.

29:13.585 --> 29:15.421
He's wearing
on his head, um...

29:15.453 --> 29:18.490
wait, there's-there's a duck.
Is that right?

29:18.523 --> 29:19.991
MAN:
You suck.

29:20.026 --> 29:23.394
Quiet. You'll miss
the humorous conclusion.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.396
She's doing quite well.

29:25.431 --> 29:27.598
Do you know this
is your fault?

29:27.633 --> 29:30.102
We have to think
of the facts, Willow.

29:30.135 --> 29:33.572
I'm very busy.
I have a gig myself, you know.

29:33.605 --> 29:35.641
Something's after us.

29:35.673 --> 29:38.109
It's like some
primal...

29:38.144 --> 29:40.278
some animal
force.

29:40.311 --> 29:42.448
That used to be us.

29:42.480 --> 29:44.650
Don't get linear
on me now, man.

29:44.682 --> 29:46.085
And then
the duck

29:46.117 --> 29:47.353
tells the doctor
that there's a man

29:47.385 --> 29:49.188
that's attached
to my ass.

29:49.221 --> 29:51.423
(audience laughs)

29:51.457 --> 29:54.125
See, it was the duck
and not the man that spoke.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.461
(applause)

29:56.895 --> 29:59.999
WILLOW:
Rupert. You've got to focus.

30:00.031 --> 30:02.701
You must have some
kind of explanation.

30:02.733 --> 30:04.536
If we don't know
what we're fighting,

30:04.569 --> 30:06.672
I don't think we
stand a chance.

30:06.704 --> 30:08.606
* It's strange

30:08.640 --> 30:10.442
* It's not like anything

30:10.476 --> 30:13.444
* We've faced before
(audience whoops, applauds)

30:13.479 --> 30:17.348
* It seems familiar somehow

30:17.383 --> 30:19.885
* Of course

30:19.919 --> 30:23.189
* The spell we cast with Buffy
(audience cheering)

30:23.221 --> 30:25.691
* Must have released

30:25.723 --> 30:27.826
* Some primal evil

30:27.859 --> 30:30.496
* That's come back seeking

30:30.528 --> 30:32.030
* I'm not sure what

30:32.064 --> 30:33.699
* Willow, look through

30:33.731 --> 30:36.835
* The chronicles
for some reference *

30:36.868 --> 30:39.671
* To a warrior beast

30:39.704 --> 30:42.974
* I've got to warn Buffy

30:43.009 --> 30:45.912
* There's every chance
she might be next *

30:45.944 --> 30:47.913
* And Xander

30:47.947 --> 30:49.315
* Help Willow

30:49.347 --> 30:51.849
* And try not to bleed

30:51.884 --> 30:55.787
* On my couch--
I've just had it steam cleaned *

30:59.224 --> 31:01.393
* No, wait...

31:01.426 --> 31:03.429
(feedback)

31:21.247 --> 31:23.249
*

31:36.162 --> 31:39.330
Well, that was obvious.

31:42.768 --> 31:43.970
(growls)

31:44.002 --> 31:46.337
I know who you are.

31:47.739 --> 31:51.542
And I can defeat you...

31:51.576 --> 31:54.046
with my intellect.

31:54.079 --> 31:56.048
I could... I can cripple you

31:56.082 --> 31:58.084
with my thoughts.

31:59.917 --> 32:01.787
Of course,
you underestimate me.

32:01.819 --> 32:04.390
You couldn't know.

32:04.423 --> 32:06.424
You never had a watcher.

32:22.673 --> 32:24.175
ANYA (whispering):
 Buffy, wake up.

32:27.546 --> 32:29.815
Buffy, you have to
wake up right away.

32:29.847 --> 32:32.851
I'm not really in charge
of these things.

32:34.319 --> 32:37.355
Please wake up.
Oh, please.

32:37.388 --> 32:40.125
I need my beauty sleep.

32:40.159 --> 32:42.461
So stop it, okay?

32:42.493 --> 32:43.494
(growls)

32:51.802 --> 32:54.506
Faith and I just made that bed.

32:54.539 --> 32:56.407
TARA:
For who?

32:59.077 --> 33:01.579
I thought you were here
to tell me.

33:04.750 --> 33:06.652
The guys aren't here,
are they?

33:06.684 --> 33:09.288
We were gonna hang out
and watch movies.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.490
You lost them.

33:11.522 --> 33:13.525
No.

33:14.559 --> 33:16.528
No.

33:16.561 --> 33:18.564
I think they need me
to find them.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.634
It's so late.

33:23.669 --> 33:25.304
Oh.

33:25.336 --> 33:27.573
That clock's completely wrong.

33:27.605 --> 33:29.174
Here.

33:31.576 --> 33:34.313
I'm never gonna use those.

33:34.346 --> 33:35.980
You think you know

33:36.013 --> 33:37.749
what's to come,

33:37.782 --> 33:40.018
what you are.

33:40.051 --> 33:43.055
You haven't even begun.

33:47.692 --> 33:49.627
I think I need
to go find the others.

33:53.030 --> 33:55.032
Be back before dawn.

33:59.037 --> 34:01.539
Have you seen my friends?

34:01.573 --> 34:03.709
They wouldn't just disappear.

34:16.887 --> 34:18.922
Mom?

34:18.956 --> 34:20.525
Oh, hi, honey.

34:20.559 --> 34:22.693
Why are you living
in the walls?

34:22.728 --> 34:25.097
Oh, sweetie, no.
I'm fine here.

34:25.130 --> 34:26.797
Don't worry about me.

34:28.467 --> 34:30.436
It looks dirty.

34:30.469 --> 34:34.039
Well, it seems that way to you.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.606
I made some lemonade,

34:35.641 --> 34:37.608
and I'm learning
how to play mah-jongg.

34:37.643 --> 34:39.777
You go find your friends.

34:39.811 --> 34:41.980
I think they
might be in danger.

34:42.012 --> 34:43.414
(laughs)

34:45.184 --> 34:47.286
I-I'm sorry, dear.

34:47.318 --> 34:51.056
Um, a mouse
is playing with my knees.

34:51.088 --> 34:54.992
I-I really don't think
you should live in there.

34:55.025 --> 34:57.929
JOYCE:
Well, you could

34:57.963 --> 34:59.965
probably break through the wall.

35:05.704 --> 35:07.172
Hey there, killer.

35:07.206 --> 35:08.639
Riley?
You're back?

35:08.673 --> 35:10.909
I never left.

35:10.942 --> 35:12.311
How did
the debriefing go?

35:12.344 --> 35:14.480
I told you
not to worry about that.

35:14.512 --> 35:15.780
It went great.

35:15.813 --> 35:17.983
They made me
surgeon general.

35:19.885 --> 35:21.786
Why didn't you
come and tell me?

35:21.820 --> 35:23.688
We could have celebrated.

35:23.722 --> 35:25.324
Oh.

35:25.356 --> 35:27.826
We're drawing up a plan
for world domination.

35:27.858 --> 35:31.530
The key element:
coffeemakers that think.

35:32.498 --> 35:35.367
World domination?

35:35.400 --> 35:37.668
Is that a good...

35:37.702 --> 35:39.304
Baby, we're the government.

35:39.338 --> 35:42.208
It's what we do.

35:42.240 --> 35:44.342
She's uncomfortable
with certain concepts.

35:44.376 --> 35:46.110
It's understandable.

35:46.143 --> 35:48.646
Aggression is a natural
human tendency,

35:48.679 --> 35:51.682
though you and me
come by it another way.

35:51.717 --> 35:52.951
(growling)

35:52.983 --> 35:55.152
We're not demons.

35:55.186 --> 35:57.356
Is that a fact?

35:57.389 --> 35:59.157
Buffy, we've got
important work here.

35:59.190 --> 36:02.092
A lot of filing,
giving things names.

36:04.161 --> 36:05.963
What was yours?

36:05.996 --> 36:08.367
Before Adam?

36:08.400 --> 36:10.536
Not a man among us
can remember.

36:10.568 --> 36:12.036
WOMAN (over PA):
The demons have escaped.

36:12.070 --> 36:13.639
Please run for your lives.
(growling)

36:13.672 --> 36:15.373
This could
be trouble.

36:15.407 --> 36:16.842
We better
make a fort.

36:16.875 --> 36:18.844
I'll get
some pillows.

36:18.876 --> 36:20.878
(growling, snarling)

36:25.384 --> 36:26.684
Wait.

36:26.717 --> 36:29.387
I have weapons.

36:54.246 --> 36:56.248
*

37:14.266 --> 37:16.268
RILEY:
I thought you were
looking for your friends.

37:16.302 --> 37:18.570
Okay, killer...

37:18.603 --> 37:20.472
if that's the way you want it,

37:20.505 --> 37:22.507
I guess you're on your own.

37:46.297 --> 37:48.300
*

38:09.153 --> 38:11.155
*

38:24.302 --> 38:27.304
I'm never gonna find them here.

38:29.641 --> 38:31.108
TARA:
 Of course not.

38:31.141 --> 38:32.744
That's the reason you came.

38:35.681 --> 38:38.215
You're not
in my dream.

38:38.248 --> 38:40.351
I was borrowed.

38:40.385 --> 38:42.554
Someone has to speak for her.

38:42.588 --> 38:45.123
Let her speak for herself.

38:45.155 --> 38:47.393
That's what's done
in polite circles.

38:51.262 --> 38:53.364
Why do you
follow me?

38:53.398 --> 38:54.666
TARA:
I don't.

38:54.699 --> 38:56.735
Where are my friends?

38:56.768 --> 39:00.038
You're asking
the wrong questions.

39:00.070 --> 39:02.340
Make her speak.

39:02.373 --> 39:05.476
I have no speech,
no name.

39:05.510 --> 39:08.012
I live
in the action of death,

39:08.045 --> 39:11.882
the blood cry,
the penetrating wound.

39:11.916 --> 39:15.521
I am destruction-- absolute,

39:15.554 --> 39:17.556
alone.

39:18.889 --> 39:20.891
The slayer?

39:21.960 --> 39:23.961
The first.

39:29.900 --> 39:32.603
I am not alone.

39:32.637 --> 39:35.039
The slayer does not
walk in this world.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.943
I walk.

39:38.976 --> 39:40.545
I talk.

39:40.579 --> 39:42.681
I shop. I sneeze.

39:42.713 --> 39:45.083
I'm gonna be a fireman
when the floods roll back.

39:45.115 --> 39:48.619
There's trees in the desert
since you moved out,

39:48.653 --> 39:52.557
and I don't sleep
on a bed of bones.

39:52.590 --> 39:55.594
Now give me back my friends.

39:57.429 --> 39:59.630
No friends.

39:59.664 --> 40:02.400
Just the kill.

40:02.434 --> 40:05.436
We are alone.

40:08.405 --> 40:11.076
That's it.
I'm waking up.

40:11.108 --> 40:13.744
(grunting)

40:29.827 --> 40:31.929
It's over.

40:31.963 --> 40:35.300
We don't do
this anymore.

40:35.333 --> 40:37.335
(grunting)

40:44.643 --> 40:46.143
Enough!

40:59.824 --> 41:01.527
(growls)

41:02.460 --> 41:04.461
(squishing)

41:07.733 --> 41:10.101
Are you quite finished?

41:10.135 --> 41:11.869
It's over, okay?

41:11.902 --> 41:14.972
I'm going to ignore you
and you're going to go away.

41:16.340 --> 41:17.809
You're really gonna
have to get over

41:17.842 --> 41:20.344
the whole primal power thing.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.682
You're not the source of me.

41:27.585 --> 41:30.121
Also-- in terms of hair care--
you really want to say,

41:30.155 --> 41:32.289
"What kind of impression
am I making in the workplace?"

41:32.322 --> 41:33.525
'Cause...

41:33.559 --> 41:35.860
(gasps)

41:45.737 --> 41:47.505
The first slayer.

41:47.539 --> 41:48.840
Wow.

41:48.873 --> 41:50.876
And not big with
the socialization.

41:50.909 --> 41:52.510
Or the floss.

41:52.543 --> 41:54.378
Somehow our
joining with Buffy

41:54.411 --> 41:56.981
and invoking
the essence of the...

41:57.014 --> 41:58.684
the slayer's power
was an affront

41:58.717 --> 42:01.351
to the source of that power.

42:01.385 --> 42:04.590
You know, you could have brought
that up to us before we did it.

42:04.623 --> 42:06.692
I did. I said there
could be dire consequences.

42:06.724 --> 42:09.661
Yes, but you say that
about chewing too fast.

42:09.695 --> 42:12.664
I'm uh, guessing
I missed some fun.

42:12.697 --> 42:14.364
The spirit of
the first slayer

42:14.398 --> 42:17.768
tried to kill us in our dreams.

42:17.802 --> 42:19.269
Oh. You want some hot chocolate?

42:19.304 --> 42:20.538
Yeah.
Yeah.
Please.

42:20.572 --> 42:22.440
Uh, Xander?
Yes, what, Joyce...

42:22.472 --> 42:25.342
uh... Buffy's mom.

42:25.376 --> 42:27.846
Be my kitchen buddy again,
help me carry?

42:27.878 --> 42:29.581
Yes, sure...

42:29.614 --> 42:31.717
Buffy's mom.

42:31.750 --> 42:34.184
Are you all right?
Yeah.

42:34.219 --> 42:36.922
I think I might
jump in the shower.

42:36.954 --> 42:38.590
You seem a bit...

42:38.623 --> 42:42.092
A little.

42:42.126 --> 42:45.063
The first slayer.

42:45.096 --> 42:47.565
I never really
thought about it.

42:47.599 --> 42:50.235
It was intense.

42:50.268 --> 42:52.804
I guess you guys
got a taste of that, huh?

42:52.838 --> 42:55.072
Yeah, from now on
you keep your slayer friends

42:55.106 --> 42:57.876
out of my dreams, is that clear?

42:57.909 --> 43:00.344
She's not good for the sleeping.

43:01.746 --> 43:03.280
Uh...

43:03.313 --> 43:05.215
Well, at least you all
didn't dream about

43:05.250 --> 43:07.152
that guy with the cheese.

43:07.184 --> 43:09.186
Don't know
where the hell that came from.

43:25.804 --> 43:27.838
TARA:
 You think you know

43:27.873 --> 43:29.940
what's to come,

43:29.974 --> 43:32.143
what you are.

43:32.177 --> 43:34.646
You haven't even begun.

44:22.393 --> 44:24.829
Grr. Argh.
