WEBVTT

00:00.006 --> 00:01.929
- Previously on "Timeless"...
- I didn't know

00:01.932 --> 00:03.754
- you were married.
- Jessica died.

00:03.757 --> 00:05.723
It was my fault.

00:05.726 --> 00:08.476
You're in love with Lucy. Just admit it.

00:08.479 --> 00:10.927
Maybe I do need to be
open to the possibilities.

00:10.929 --> 00:14.382
- Possibilities of what?
- I don't know.

00:14.385 --> 00:16.619
Jiya. Jiya!

00:16.625 --> 00:19.836
- Where'd you go?
- Um...

00:19.838 --> 00:21.773
Nicholas Keynes, that's the soldier

00:21.776 --> 00:23.740
that they saved and brought
back to the present.

00:23.742 --> 00:26.109
These plans, this manifesto...
Nicholas Keynes wrote it.

00:26.111 --> 00:27.711
You were right about time travel.

00:27.713 --> 00:28.679
It's possible.

00:28.682 --> 00:30.413
We commissioned a time machine.

00:30.416 --> 00:31.748
And now we've got work to do.

00:31.750 --> 00:33.085
I've been reading these plans.

00:33.088 --> 00:34.849
It's about key moments in history

00:34.852 --> 00:36.054
to change the present.

00:36.057 --> 00:37.079
Sleeper cells.

00:37.082 --> 00:38.988
I mean, what if
Rittenhouse already planted

00:38.991 --> 00:40.757
who knows how many agents in history?

00:40.759 --> 00:43.218
What if they're all
just biding their time,

00:43.221 --> 00:46.797
living regular lives, just
waiting to be activated?

00:48.000 --> 00:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:56.675 --> 00:58.742
Just know that you'll be fine.

00:58.744 --> 01:03.280
Stick to the plan.
Remember your training.

01:03.282 --> 01:06.316
- Make us proud, son.
- Okay.

01:31.710 --> 01:35.011
Yah, faster, Atreyu!

01:35.013 --> 01:37.380
We must win, or my family will die!

01:37.382 --> 01:39.859
Yah, giddyup!

01:39.862 --> 01:41.962
Cut!

01:41.965 --> 01:46.156
Roman charioteers do not say
"giddyup" to their horses.

01:46.158 --> 01:47.679
Right, sorry.

01:47.682 --> 01:50.082
I just finished filming a Western, so...

01:50.085 --> 01:52.019
Let's try it again.

01:53.332 --> 01:54.831
We're shutting you down, Bob.

01:54.833 --> 01:56.166
What? We just started filming.

01:56.168 --> 01:57.501
And you're already over budget.

01:57.503 --> 01:58.750
- You can't.
- I can.

01:58.753 --> 02:00.203
It's a lousy picture anyway,

02:00.205 --> 02:01.705
just like your last three.

02:01.707 --> 02:03.907
We're pulling your leads
for a television show.

02:03.909 --> 02:06.376
- Television?
- It's the future.

02:14.286 --> 02:16.898
That's a nice-looking suit.

02:16.901 --> 02:19.589
Dad!

02:19.591 --> 02:21.343
Son.

02:21.346 --> 02:23.245
Sorry. It's been a while.

02:23.248 --> 02:25.082
Look at you. You look so young.

02:25.085 --> 02:26.863
It's only been a couple months for me.

02:26.865 --> 02:30.460
- 15 years for you.
- Well, yeah, producer at RKO.

02:30.463 --> 02:33.393
You've done well, son.
You've done very well.

02:33.396 --> 02:36.264
- So you're here.
- I found Nicholas Keynes.

02:36.267 --> 02:38.133
Plucked him right out of World War I.

02:38.136 --> 02:40.168
My God. What's he like?

02:40.171 --> 02:41.778
He's even more brilliant
than we could have hoped.

02:41.780 --> 02:44.447
He's mapped it out,
has plans for all of us.

02:44.449 --> 02:48.718
And it's time for you to play your part.

02:48.720 --> 02:51.507
So what can I do?

03:06.637 --> 03:09.071
Jiya, what the hell?

03:09.074 --> 03:11.408
Jiya, are you okay?

03:11.410 --> 03:13.406
What happened?

03:13.409 --> 03:15.842
You're saying this has
been going on for months?

03:15.845 --> 03:17.345
Ever since her trip in the "Lifeboat."

03:17.347 --> 03:19.214
And not one of you thought
to tell me about it?

03:19.217 --> 03:21.418
Jiya made us promise not to.

03:21.420 --> 03:23.454
What? Why?

03:25.457 --> 03:27.328
I didn't want you to bench me.

03:27.331 --> 03:28.974
You probably think that
I'm expendable, but I'm not.

03:28.976 --> 03:31.195
Jiya, no one here is expendable,

03:31.198 --> 03:33.332
not to me, but you need a doctor.

03:33.335 --> 03:35.698
What's the point? I mean,
unless you have someone

03:35.701 --> 03:38.257
that specializes in time
travel related illnesses?

03:38.260 --> 03:39.861
- She's got you there.
- You're not the least bit

03:39.863 --> 03:42.130
- concerned about this?
- Reentry issues.

03:42.133 --> 03:44.911
Like an astronaut coming
back with space sickness.

03:44.914 --> 03:46.476
I don't think there's
anything to worry about.

03:46.478 --> 03:47.911
Seizures and hallucinations

03:47.913 --> 03:50.180
are nothing to worry about?

03:50.182 --> 03:52.382
I'm not so sure they're hallucinations.

03:52.384 --> 03:54.656
What are you talking
about? What are they?

03:54.659 --> 03:56.921
- What are you seeing?
- I'm not sure, okay?

03:56.924 --> 03:58.722
I don't know. I don't
know how to explain it.

03:58.724 --> 04:02.132
- This could be very serious.
- Guys, please stop.

04:02.135 --> 04:03.768
I appreciate the concern. I really do.

04:03.771 --> 04:05.071
But I actually have work to do,

04:05.074 --> 04:06.607
so if you could just lay off of me.

04:10.941 --> 04:13.335
Saved by the proverbial bell.

04:13.338 --> 04:15.000
Where's the Mothership now?

04:15.003 --> 04:20.206
Uh, January 2, 1941. Los Angeles.

04:20.209 --> 04:22.570
Well, I don't know. Hitler's in power.

04:22.573 --> 04:24.039
Europe's engulfed in World War II.

04:24.042 --> 04:25.509
What's that got to do with LA?

04:25.512 --> 04:28.812
I don't know, but I know who might.

04:37.195 --> 04:39.362
There, all finished.

04:39.364 --> 04:41.101
You'll stay the night for observations.

04:41.104 --> 04:42.503
Enjoy the luxury accommodations.

04:42.506 --> 04:43.593
Thanks, Doc.

04:43.596 --> 04:45.128
I'll try and get stabbed more often.

04:45.131 --> 04:46.914
- Who did this to you?
- Who do you think?

04:46.917 --> 04:49.838
Rittenhouse? In here,
that's highly unlikely.

04:49.841 --> 04:52.008
You're probably right.
Even though we hadn't met,

04:52.010 --> 04:54.554
I'm sure the inmate who
stabbed me at breakfast

04:54.557 --> 04:57.019
with a spoon shank
had a very good reason.

04:57.022 --> 04:59.189
Where is this guy?
We should talk to him.

04:59.192 --> 05:01.083
Might be difficult. He's dead.

05:01.086 --> 05:03.609
- How?
- I severed his carotid artery.

05:03.612 --> 05:06.021
But it's so nice of you to
come and check on me, though.

05:06.024 --> 05:08.425
- That's not why we're here.
- Let me guess, then.

05:08.427 --> 05:12.329
- Rittenhouse took another trip?
- Yup.

05:12.331 --> 05:14.648
January 2, 1941. Los Angeles.

05:16.601 --> 05:20.404
Do you have any ability
to do this on your own?

05:21.707 --> 05:23.773
You want to stop
Rittenhouse as much as we do.

05:23.775 --> 05:26.210
Absolutely, once you get me out of here.

05:26.213 --> 05:28.211
- No.
- Well, then you're on your own.

05:33.685 --> 05:35.945
I can put in a request to, uh...

05:35.948 --> 05:37.954
get you a more secure situation.

05:37.956 --> 05:40.256
Maybe get you limited
Internet privileges.

05:40.258 --> 05:42.609
I don't want a damn
Netflix subscription.

05:42.612 --> 05:44.060
I want to get the hell out of here!

05:48.934 --> 05:51.007
Rittenhouse will send someone else

05:51.010 --> 05:53.410
and then someone else.

05:53.413 --> 05:55.742
They won't stop until I'm dead.

05:55.745 --> 05:56.856
I'll see what I can do.

05:56.859 --> 05:58.025
But I don't have the authority to...

05:58.027 --> 05:59.127
I can get you out of here.

05:59.130 --> 06:00.507
- Lucy.
- If you tell us

06:00.510 --> 06:02.921
what Rittenhouse is
doing in 1941 Los Angeles.

06:02.924 --> 06:04.913
And why would I trust you this time?

06:04.916 --> 06:07.417
Because as much as you need us,

06:07.419 --> 06:08.752
we need you more.

06:13.825 --> 06:16.459
Do either of you have a pen?

06:16.461 --> 06:18.429
I need to draw it for you.

06:28.552 --> 06:29.818
So is this how we do it now?

06:29.821 --> 06:31.155
We just steal clothes wherever we go,

06:31.157 --> 06:32.941
like Winona Ryder pre-"Stranger Things"?

06:32.944 --> 06:34.611
I hate it when a department store clerk

06:34.613 --> 06:36.613
thinks I'm there to shoplift
and he's actually right.

06:36.615 --> 06:38.164
At least there's no security tags.

06:38.167 --> 06:39.566
Not until the '60s, anyway.

06:39.569 --> 06:41.302
Think Flynn's messing with us?

06:41.305 --> 06:43.018
I think he gave us what he had.

06:43.021 --> 06:45.288
No, he drew us a damn "Pictionary" clue.

06:45.290 --> 06:47.290
He said that he found this drawing

06:47.292 --> 06:49.515
on a Rittenhouse agent, dated 1941.

06:49.518 --> 06:51.351
So Flynn says we jump and now we jump?

06:51.354 --> 06:53.155
Look, if he's playing us,
then we play him right back.

06:53.157 --> 06:54.623
Let him rot in prison.

06:54.626 --> 06:57.394
Well, I don't think he's playing us.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.371
Can I see some ID, please?

07:07.779 --> 07:10.814
Why would Rittenhouse send
someone to a movie studio?

07:10.816 --> 07:13.828
Who doesn't want to be famous?

07:13.831 --> 07:18.335
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

07:23.337 --> 07:26.104
All right.

07:26.106 --> 07:27.539
Wow.

07:35.849 --> 07:37.983
Maybe Rittenhouse gave up their plans

07:37.985 --> 07:40.852
for world domination
to pursue show business.

07:40.854 --> 07:42.287
So how are we supposed to find

07:42.289 --> 07:43.861
whatever it is we're supposed to find

07:43.864 --> 07:45.464
in a place this big?

07:45.467 --> 07:46.858
Remember, we're looking
for the sleeper agent,

07:46.860 --> 07:48.936
someone hiding in plain sight.

07:48.939 --> 07:50.039
Right, which could be anybody,

07:50.041 --> 07:51.129
- so stay alert.
- Okay.

07:51.131 --> 07:54.699
- See some ID.
- Oh, um...

07:54.701 --> 07:57.669
well, we already checked
in with the guy at the gate.

07:57.671 --> 07:59.504
- Yeah.
- I am the guy at the gate.

07:59.506 --> 08:02.040
Right. I meant the other
guy at the other gate.

08:02.042 --> 08:03.341
Hmm.

08:03.343 --> 08:05.043
Nice try. Come with me.

08:05.045 --> 08:06.978
Do you know who I am?

08:06.980 --> 08:09.648
- I'm Langston Hughes.
- Not on my list.

08:09.650 --> 08:11.449
Well, then someone's made a mistake.

08:11.451 --> 08:13.685
I won an Oscar for "Way Down South."

08:13.687 --> 08:15.120
- You did?
- No, he didn't.

08:15.122 --> 08:16.510
Well, I should have. I was robbed.

08:16.513 --> 08:17.512
Who are you here to see?

08:17.515 --> 08:19.846
Who am I here to see?

08:19.849 --> 08:22.159
The president of the studio.

08:22.162 --> 08:24.596
- Barney Balaban.
- Barney Balaban.

08:24.598 --> 08:27.465
- And you're making us late.
- We'll see about that.

08:27.467 --> 08:28.833
- Mm-hmm.
- This way.

08:28.835 --> 08:30.502
- Great.
- This way.

08:30.504 --> 08:32.136
Your way, great, okay.

08:32.139 --> 08:33.804
I'm sorry, Mr. Hughes, but I don't have

08:33.807 --> 08:36.207
- a meeting scheduled for you.
- That's what I thought.

08:36.208 --> 08:38.476
Wait.

08:38.477 --> 08:40.712
I'm writing a comedy musical

08:40.714 --> 08:44.049
based off of my book
"The Ways of White Folks."

08:44.051 --> 08:45.741
These are the white folks.

08:45.744 --> 08:47.886
Brilliant actors, the both of them.

08:47.888 --> 08:50.088
- The next Bogey and Bacall.
- Bogey and who?

08:50.090 --> 08:51.756
- Fairbanks and Pickford.
- These guys are

08:51.758 --> 08:53.425
- wasting your time, ma'am.
- I...

08:53.427 --> 08:55.752
Hello there. What is all this?

08:55.755 --> 08:57.128
- That's Barney Balaban.
- I thought I had

08:57.130 --> 09:00.213
- my afternoon free.
- Mr. Balaban.

09:00.216 --> 09:04.035
I'm Langston Hughes, and I have
never been treated this poorly

09:04.037 --> 09:05.337
in my entire life.

09:05.339 --> 09:07.572
I may just take my film to MGM

09:07.574 --> 09:11.291
or... some other studio.

09:15.248 --> 09:18.650
Langston Hughes. Real honor to meet you.

09:18.652 --> 09:21.853
Now, let's talk about
this new film of yours.

09:21.855 --> 09:23.088
Langston Hughes,

09:23.090 --> 09:24.289
the father of the Harlem Renaissance?

09:24.291 --> 09:25.724
Are you sure you can pull this off?

09:25.726 --> 09:28.860
Who knows what writers look like?

09:28.862 --> 09:31.896
Hamilton, as a musical?

09:31.898 --> 09:33.665
It'll never work.

09:33.667 --> 09:36.334
What else have you got for me?

09:36.336 --> 09:40.305
Well, how about a thriller
about a secret cabal

09:40.307 --> 09:42.474
named Rittenhouse...

09:42.476 --> 09:45.110
Who bends history in their favor?

09:45.112 --> 09:46.244
Mm.

09:46.246 --> 09:49.447
- Sound familiar?
- At all?

09:49.449 --> 09:51.583
Yes.

09:51.585 --> 09:55.019
Very familiar. Too familiar.

09:56.957 --> 10:00.625
Because secret cabal
conspiracy stories are overdone.

10:00.627 --> 10:03.461
I want something new,

10:03.463 --> 10:06.331
something different... but the same.

10:06.333 --> 10:09.499
- Mm.
- And that sells but wins awards.

10:09.502 --> 10:11.770
Mm.

10:11.772 --> 10:13.838
Barney, I can't do this picture.

10:13.840 --> 10:16.274
I won't. Have you read the last rewrite?

10:16.276 --> 10:18.244
The writing's more tragic than "Hamlet."

10:18.247 --> 10:19.944
So we'll get you a new writer.

10:19.946 --> 10:21.946
Writers are literally a dime a dozen.

10:21.948 --> 10:24.716
I mean, uh, we have a great one here.

10:24.718 --> 10:26.985
This is Langston Hughes

10:26.987 --> 10:29.687
and actors from his newest musical.

10:29.689 --> 10:32.624
- Logan and Preston.
- Right, Logan and Preston.

10:32.626 --> 10:35.393
- I'm sure you all know...
- Hedy Lamarr.

10:35.395 --> 10:40.131
Well, you are even more
glamorous in person.

10:40.133 --> 10:42.333
Thank you, dear, but any
girl can be glamorous.

10:42.335 --> 10:45.603
All you have to do is
stand still and look stupid.

10:45.605 --> 10:47.806
You are right. You are so right.

10:47.809 --> 10:49.882
And you are so much more than that.

10:49.885 --> 10:51.042
I'm sorry.

10:51.044 --> 10:52.977
- Thank you.
- So I will see you

10:52.979 --> 10:54.345
at the Beverly House this evening?

10:54.347 --> 10:56.181
Sadly, yes. George is forcing me.

10:56.183 --> 10:58.483
Personally, I'd rather
have my teeth cleaned.

10:58.485 --> 10:59.517
Mm.

11:00.699 --> 11:02.667
Oh, excuse me a moment.

11:05.659 --> 11:07.459
Hello?

11:07.461 --> 11:09.360
Hold on.

11:09.362 --> 11:13.619
What do you mean RKO 281 was stolen?

11:13.622 --> 11:16.067
I know we share a wall,
but I'm not closing

11:16.069 --> 11:20.371
the Paramount gates
because RKO lost a picture!

11:20.373 --> 11:22.674
Excuse me, everyone. Little emergency.

11:22.676 --> 11:24.517
- It's a pleasure meeting you all.
- Yeah.

11:24.520 --> 11:27.044
Hedy, we'll speak more tonight.

11:27.047 --> 11:30.585
RKO 281 was the code
name for "Citizen Kane."

11:30.588 --> 11:32.250
It was shrouded in secrecy.

11:32.252 --> 11:34.219
Orson Welles was cutting it
until the very last second.

11:34.221 --> 11:35.687
And that's when you
actually had to cut the film

11:35.689 --> 11:37.422
and tape it together piece by piece.

11:37.424 --> 11:39.257
- There was only one copy.
- Okay, did it ever go missing?

11:39.259 --> 11:41.392
Not that I know of. Until now.

11:41.394 --> 11:43.094
You think Rittenhouse
stole "Citizen Kane"?

11:43.096 --> 11:45.230
- Who else could it be?
- Why would they want to?

11:45.232 --> 11:47.465
- It is an amazing movie.
- Is it? Never saw it.

11:47.467 --> 11:50.034
- You never saw it?
- Sorry.

11:50.036 --> 11:51.436
You know what? There was one person

11:51.438 --> 11:52.804
that wanted to kill "Citizen Kane":

11:52.806 --> 11:54.305
William Randolph Hearst.

11:54.307 --> 11:56.407
Owned dozens of newspapers,

11:56.409 --> 11:58.643
over 20 million readers.

11:58.645 --> 12:01.212
The movie's basically about him
and his mistress, Marion Davies.

12:01.214 --> 12:02.664
So you think he's got
something to do with it?

12:02.666 --> 12:03.690
Well, maybe.

12:03.693 --> 12:06.651
I mean, Hearst was furious at
Welles for making the movie.

12:06.653 --> 12:08.386
We could find out at his party tonight.

12:08.388 --> 12:10.088
Wait, you know Hearst's party schedule?

12:10.090 --> 12:11.244
Well, Barney and Hedy

12:11.247 --> 12:12.707
said they were going to Beverly House,

12:12.709 --> 12:14.292
which is the nickname that they gave

12:14.294 --> 12:15.861
Hearst's Beverly Hills mansion.

12:15.864 --> 12:18.530
Okay, well, we're gonna
need some nicer clothes.

12:18.532 --> 12:20.598
Hmm?

12:20.600 --> 12:22.800
Come on.

12:29.943 --> 12:31.776
Hedy Lamarr? Isn't she famous for, like,

12:31.778 --> 12:33.382
getting naked in some movie in the '30s?

12:33.385 --> 12:34.979
Stay there.

12:34.981 --> 12:37.448
She was deemed the most
beautiful woman in the world

12:37.450 --> 12:40.418
- but also a scientist.
- Beautiful naked scientist?

12:40.420 --> 12:43.187
Almost sounds made
up... By someone like me.

12:43.189 --> 12:45.156
She patented frequency hopping

12:45.158 --> 12:47.825
for radio-guided torpedoes
and basically invented Wi-Fi.

12:47.827 --> 12:49.780
- How did I not know this?
- Most people don't.

12:49.783 --> 12:51.462
She let the patent expire in 59.

12:51.464 --> 12:53.431
The navy used it in
62. It's a shame too.

12:53.433 --> 12:56.200
- She never saw a penny from it.
- Psst! This way, come on.

12:56.202 --> 12:58.770
- Okay.
- Come on.

12:58.772 --> 13:00.271
And make it quick, all right?

13:04.544 --> 13:06.898
Now, it's really important
that we keep this hidden.

13:06.901 --> 13:08.948
They're scouring the lot looking for it.

13:10.182 --> 13:12.482
I'm proud of you, son.

13:12.485 --> 13:14.419
You've done everything
exactly as planned.

13:14.421 --> 13:16.888
- Thanks, Dad.
- Once we're done here,

13:16.890 --> 13:19.657
you're coming home.

13:19.659 --> 13:21.693
You know, I got a real good life here.

13:21.695 --> 13:23.161
Great job, big house,

13:23.163 --> 13:24.862
different starlet
every night of the week.

13:24.864 --> 13:26.698
Maybe you could stay here with me.

13:26.700 --> 13:29.801
That's a fun idea.

13:29.803 --> 13:32.470
But we have more work to do.

13:32.472 --> 13:33.771
Worth a try.

13:33.773 --> 13:34.835
Hmm.

13:39.479 --> 13:41.512
I have a doctor coming to see you.

13:41.514 --> 13:45.183
He knows about the seizures,
not the time travel.

13:45.185 --> 13:49.020
- I don't like doctors.
- Who does? But you need one.

13:49.022 --> 13:50.924
Surely she can decide for herself

13:50.927 --> 13:52.991
- if she wants to see a doctor.
- I don't recall asking

13:52.993 --> 13:54.927
- for your opinion on this.
- No.

13:57.998 --> 14:00.131
My dad had back pain.

14:00.133 --> 14:01.699
So we took him to the doctor's,

14:01.701 --> 14:06.270
and he was diagnosed
with pancreatic cancer.

14:06.272 --> 14:09.207
Two months later, he was gone.

14:09.209 --> 14:11.510
Everything was really good until then.

14:11.513 --> 14:13.425
Look, if there's
something wrong with me,

14:13.428 --> 14:14.694
I don't want to know.

14:14.697 --> 14:16.481
I just want to get on with my life.

14:16.483 --> 14:18.683
Jiya.

14:18.685 --> 14:21.476
Whatever the doctor says
is causing these seizures,

14:21.479 --> 14:24.355
we will deal with it
and make you better.

14:24.357 --> 14:26.858
Okay? I promise.

14:44.077 --> 14:45.576
Right this way, please.

14:54.220 --> 14:55.853
Okay, so what's the plan?

14:55.855 --> 14:57.313
Walk in, thank the host for having us,

14:57.315 --> 14:59.057
and then ask if he stole "Citizen Kane"?

14:59.059 --> 15:00.625
And if Rittenhouse helped him out?

15:00.627 --> 15:02.760
For all we know, Hearst is Rittenhouse.

15:02.762 --> 15:04.233
Man, more security in Hollywood

15:04.236 --> 15:05.296
than Nazi Germany.

15:05.298 --> 15:08.266
And just as many black people.

15:08.268 --> 15:09.802
Shall we?

15:11.805 --> 15:13.539
Good evening.

15:15.909 --> 15:19.577
Langston, darling. How
lovely to see you again.

15:19.579 --> 15:22.113
- Hi, Hedy.
- Come with me.

15:22.115 --> 15:25.116
Charlie, go ahead and
park it up the hill.

15:25.118 --> 15:28.252
I'm dying to speak to
you about your poetry.

15:30.090 --> 15:32.557
Please, Langston, darling.

15:32.559 --> 15:34.382
Just one or two verses

15:34.385 --> 15:36.794
of your latest book of poems.

15:36.796 --> 15:38.996
I'm more writer than performer.

15:38.998 --> 15:42.767
Hollywood has no
culture. Please, you must.

15:42.769 --> 15:46.938
All right, if I must.

15:46.940 --> 15:50.708
Here's my latest.

15:50.710 --> 15:53.311
Now, this is a story

15:53.313 --> 15:57.915
all about how my life got flipped,

15:57.917 --> 15:59.898
turned upside down.

15:59.901 --> 16:01.619
I'd like to take a minute.

16:01.621 --> 16:03.054
Just sit right there.

16:03.056 --> 16:05.957
I'll tell you how I became the prince

16:05.959 --> 16:09.060
of a town called Bel-Air.

16:12.065 --> 16:14.299
Well, that was truly...

16:17.604 --> 16:19.203
Awful.

16:19.205 --> 16:20.938
I was thinking you don't resemble

16:20.940 --> 16:22.540
the photo from your book.

16:22.542 --> 16:23.708
Now I know why.

16:23.710 --> 16:25.743
You're not Langston Hughes.

16:27.480 --> 16:29.881
So who are you, really?

16:40.528 --> 16:41.661
Hey.

16:41.663 --> 16:42.962
That's Hearst.

16:47.502 --> 16:49.101
Hey, guys, guess what.

16:49.103 --> 16:52.004
Hedy knows I'm not Langston Hughes.

16:52.006 --> 16:53.974
He told me what you're doing here.

16:56.110 --> 16:58.486
- He did?
- How Hearst stole

16:58.489 --> 17:00.546
"Citizen Kane" and we're
here to get it back.

17:00.548 --> 17:01.877
- He did.
- Yeah.

17:01.880 --> 17:03.516
You're all friends with Orson?

17:03.518 --> 17:05.651
Yup, he sent us here, actually.

17:05.653 --> 17:07.587
Can't really come here himself, can he?

17:08.903 --> 17:10.636
We just couldn't let Hearst do this.

17:10.638 --> 17:12.924
I mean, "Citizen Kane" is
just such an amazing film.

17:12.926 --> 17:14.760
- Yeah.
- You've seen "Citizen Kane"?

17:14.762 --> 17:17.329
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's amazing.

17:17.332 --> 17:18.483
Private screening.

17:18.486 --> 17:19.585
Spoiler alert:

17:19.588 --> 17:21.767
Rosebud's a sled.

17:21.769 --> 17:23.368
What's a spoiler?

17:26.608 --> 17:28.674
He screened it for me also.

17:28.676 --> 17:29.942
True work of a genius.

17:29.944 --> 17:32.278
- Mm-hmm.
- How can I help?

17:32.280 --> 17:35.748
Well, um, if you could
introduce us to Hearst,

17:35.750 --> 17:37.483
that would be helpful.

17:37.485 --> 17:40.086
I'd be happy to.

17:40.088 --> 17:41.754
But it seems he's leaving the party.

17:41.756 --> 17:43.155
Who's that with him?

17:43.157 --> 17:45.024
Lucas Calhoun, producer at RKO.

17:45.026 --> 17:46.822
He's all hands, a real louse.

17:46.825 --> 17:48.491
But he makes good pictures.

17:48.494 --> 17:50.931
He's putting one together
right now about dinosaurs.

17:50.934 --> 17:54.133
It sounds brilliant. He
calls it "Jurassic Park."

17:54.135 --> 17:55.935
He really is ahead of his time.

18:06.333 --> 18:07.881
We need to hear what they're saying.

18:07.884 --> 18:09.181
- Come on.
- Okay.

18:09.183 --> 18:11.484
Hedy, Langston!

18:11.486 --> 18:13.819
And the next Fairbanks and Pickford.

18:13.821 --> 18:15.755
- Logan and Preston.
- Logan and Preston!

18:15.757 --> 18:18.424
Who here wants a song?

18:19.861 --> 18:21.761
- Oh, no. No, no.
- Uh, no.

18:21.763 --> 18:23.763
Aw, I thought you two
said you were in a musical.

18:24.966 --> 18:26.465
Well, follow me.

18:26.467 --> 18:28.260
Best piano player in town is here.

18:28.263 --> 18:29.619
Name's Buster.

18:29.622 --> 18:31.837
You told me you could sing.
You used to be in a band?

18:31.839 --> 18:33.375
Yeah, but I haven't sung
since the car accident.

18:33.377 --> 18:34.840
Yes, you can. I know you can do this.

18:34.842 --> 18:36.175
No, I can't. You have
to go up there with me.

18:36.177 --> 18:37.643
- We're a duo.
- No, I cannot sing.

18:37.645 --> 18:39.514
I will blow our cover
if I sing. I promise.

18:39.517 --> 18:42.281
Excuse me, everyone.
I'd like to introduce

18:42.283 --> 18:45.618
a talented new duo, Logan and Preston.

18:45.620 --> 18:46.886
Come on up.

18:46.888 --> 18:47.987
- Come on.
- A song.

18:47.989 --> 18:49.021
- Go ahead, yeah.
- No?

18:49.023 --> 18:51.190
- Go.
- Okay.

18:51.192 --> 18:52.858
Oh, um...

18:52.860 --> 18:54.860
- Just one, please?
- Just one.

18:54.862 --> 18:56.095
- For me?
- For you.

18:56.097 --> 18:58.164
Okay.

19:00.435 --> 19:02.235
So many people.

19:03.171 --> 19:06.872
- What are we doing?
- Um...

19:06.874 --> 19:09.141
Do you know "You Made Me Love You"?

19:09.143 --> 19:10.309
- I do.
- Oh, good.

19:10.311 --> 19:12.178
- Yeah, G?
- Sure.

19:12.180 --> 19:13.479
Okay.

19:19.654 --> 19:21.020
Nope, missed it.

19:22.390 --> 19:24.890
- Yep, yep.
- That's it.

- Where are they?
- They're in the next room.

21:39.105 --> 21:41.006
That's Hearst's office right there.

21:44.486 --> 21:46.947
The walls are too thick.
Could I use your glass?

21:46.950 --> 21:48.087
Mm.

21:48.090 --> 21:49.358
This should amplify the sound

21:49.361 --> 21:50.454
coming through the wall.

21:50.457 --> 21:52.361
I'm familiar with acoustic coupling.

21:52.364 --> 21:54.198
Right, of course you are.

21:55.973 --> 21:57.306
Damn it.

21:57.309 --> 21:59.201
It's still not clear enough.

21:59.204 --> 22:00.637
I know another way,

22:00.639 --> 22:03.340
but we'll need some cellulose tape.

22:03.342 --> 22:04.708
You mean like Scotch tape?

22:04.710 --> 22:06.876
Well, it doesn't matter which brand.

22:06.878 --> 22:07.878
Right.

22:09.514 --> 22:11.348
First you need a hole in the wall.

22:11.350 --> 22:14.718
Then cover the hole
with a thin membrane.

22:14.720 --> 22:16.386
Equalizing the pressure on both sides,

22:16.388 --> 22:18.221
- funneling the sound through.
- Mm-hmm.

22:18.223 --> 22:20.256
There, now you can hear them speaking.

22:20.258 --> 22:22.400
Better with the glass.

22:22.403 --> 22:24.036
If I didn't already have a girlfriend,

22:24.039 --> 22:25.862
I'd say you were the perfect woman.

22:25.864 --> 22:27.698
But I do, so I won't.

22:29.735 --> 22:32.173
- Where's the rest of it?
- It's in a safe place.

22:32.176 --> 22:34.243
It's all yours, all six reels.

22:34.246 --> 22:36.846
Once you agree to our terms.

22:36.849 --> 22:38.942
- Well?
- A weekly column

22:38.944 --> 22:40.777
- in all your papers.
- What kind of column?

22:40.779 --> 22:42.812
The kind that we write and you publish.

22:42.814 --> 22:46.243
- No questions asked.
- That's all, just one column?

22:46.246 --> 22:47.712
Small price to pay.

22:47.715 --> 22:49.861
Trust me, you don't want
that film getting out.

22:49.864 --> 22:51.398
"Rosebud" ring a bell?

22:53.291 --> 22:55.592
You have yourself a deal.

23:01.762 --> 23:03.362
So he gives Hearst the movie.

23:03.365 --> 23:04.967
In return, Hearst gives him a column.

23:04.970 --> 23:06.569
- I don't get it.
- Hearst's papers

23:06.571 --> 23:08.017
were hugely influential.

23:08.020 --> 23:09.806
I mean, he helped start
the Spanish-American War

23:09.808 --> 23:11.348
through his use of yellow journalism.

23:11.351 --> 23:13.409
Fake news. But, like, actual fake news.

23:13.412 --> 23:15.578
If Rittenhouse can print
their own propaganda

23:15.580 --> 23:17.046
in Hearst's papers, they can basically

23:17.048 --> 23:18.486
rewrite history as it happens.

23:18.489 --> 23:20.483
Whoever controls information
controls everything.

23:20.485 --> 23:22.650
They make the exchange at
10:00 a.m. tomorrow morning

23:22.653 --> 23:24.988
- on Stage 14.
- Not if we can stop it.

23:29.327 --> 23:32.429
- Couldn't get a taxi?
- Hi, Hedy.

23:32.431 --> 23:34.764
It's just such a lovely
night. We decided to walk.

23:34.766 --> 23:35.900
Yeah.

23:35.903 --> 23:38.503
Nobody walks in LA. Get in.

23:38.506 --> 23:41.805
- Where are you staying?
- We're between hotels.

23:41.807 --> 23:44.407
Where's Jiya?

23:44.409 --> 23:46.676
Still in with the doctor,
hearing the bad news,

23:46.678 --> 23:49.012
thanks to you.

23:49.014 --> 23:52.816
- Well, that was optimistic.
- I'm being realistic.

23:52.818 --> 23:55.351
Had you spoken to me before
insisting Jiya see a doctor,

23:55.353 --> 23:57.120
I might have saved you that argument

23:57.122 --> 23:59.122
and given you the prognosis myself.

23:59.124 --> 24:01.191
What are you talking about?

24:01.193 --> 24:03.293
When we first began
testing the "Lifeboat,"

24:03.295 --> 24:06.790
we had two pilots come
back with the same symptoms.

24:06.793 --> 24:09.954
There are rules for a reason.
I told them. I warned them.

24:09.957 --> 24:12.468
The "Lifeboat" isn't equipped
for more than three people.

24:12.471 --> 24:16.172
What happened to the other two pilots?

24:16.174 --> 24:20.443
Well, we did test after test.

24:20.445 --> 24:24.314
- None of it mattered.
- Mason, what happened to them?

24:24.316 --> 24:27.350
One of them is being treated
for severe schizophrenia.

24:27.352 --> 24:31.120
The other died of a brain aneurysm.

24:31.122 --> 24:33.790
- Does Rufus know about this?
- Have you met Rufus?

24:33.792 --> 24:35.658
No, do you think he would have let Jiya

24:35.661 --> 24:37.559
risk her life like
that if he'd known? No.

24:37.562 --> 24:41.130
So you kept it from him? From all of us?

24:41.132 --> 24:42.900
Why don't you have me arrested?

24:46.505 --> 24:49.739
No good can come from
her knowing, Denise.

24:49.741 --> 24:52.809
There's no medicine to fix this.

24:52.811 --> 24:54.962
There's nothing any of us can do.

25:00.085 --> 25:03.853
Oh, just thank you so much
for letting us stay with you.

25:03.855 --> 25:05.704
Any friends of Orson's
are friends of mine.

25:05.707 --> 25:07.690
George, darling, would
you make us some drinks?

25:07.692 --> 25:09.225
Coming right up.

25:09.227 --> 25:11.361
What do you plan to do
about Orson's picture?

25:11.363 --> 25:13.263
Well, we plan on killing the deal.

25:13.265 --> 25:15.947
Hey, how'd you know all
of that about the, uh,

25:15.950 --> 25:18.951
- tape and the hole in the wall?
- I have an inventive mind.

25:18.954 --> 25:21.955
She has an entire room
devoted to her inventions.

25:21.958 --> 25:23.691
You knew what I was
talking about, though,

25:23.694 --> 25:26.048
- with the sound waves.
- Well, not to brag, but, uh,

25:26.051 --> 25:28.051
I consider myself
something of a scientist.

25:28.054 --> 25:29.646
Would you like to see what George and I

25:29.648 --> 25:31.114
- have been working on?
- She says that

25:31.116 --> 25:33.316
as if you actually have a choice.

25:33.318 --> 25:35.218
- This way.
- You two lovebirds

25:35.220 --> 25:36.886
make yourself at home.

25:36.888 --> 25:39.422
Did you know torpedoes are radio guided?

25:39.424 --> 25:41.591
We found a way to change the signal,

25:41.593 --> 25:44.961
making it harder for
enemies to detect or jam...

25:44.963 --> 25:46.729
Lovebirds?

25:46.731 --> 25:48.465
Cheers.

25:50.602 --> 25:51.735
Cheers.

25:57.008 --> 26:00.677
So how long have George
and Hedy been together?

26:00.679 --> 26:03.243
They're not, just friends.

26:04.582 --> 26:06.649
George is Hedy's inventing partner,

26:06.652 --> 26:09.818
and he's a talented composer.

26:09.821 --> 26:12.255
You know, their idea
for frequency hopping

26:12.257 --> 26:15.087
came from George's
knowledge of player pianos.

26:15.090 --> 26:16.693
You know, he doesn't really look at her

26:16.695 --> 26:18.695
like an inventing partner.

26:18.697 --> 26:20.830
George has a huge crush on her.

26:20.832 --> 26:24.567
As most men do, but...

26:24.569 --> 26:26.658
George was married when they met, so...

26:26.661 --> 26:29.228
Bad timing.

26:29.231 --> 26:30.807
Of course, Hedy's into taller men,

26:30.809 --> 26:32.675
and George is...

26:32.677 --> 26:35.111
shall we say vertically challenged.

26:35.113 --> 26:36.778
- Mm, ouch.
- Yeah.

26:36.781 --> 26:38.681
- Poor guy never had a shot.
- Nope.

26:41.137 --> 26:43.579
- Mm, thank you.
- Yup.

26:47.291 --> 26:50.192
Well, you know, uh, some men find

26:50.195 --> 26:52.662
a beautiful woman with
brains intimidating.

26:52.664 --> 26:54.631
Well, Hedy just wants to be respected.

26:54.633 --> 26:56.934
Mm, I wasn't talking about Hedy.

26:59.637 --> 27:03.538
You find me... intimidating?

27:03.541 --> 27:05.942
Oh, no, I'm sorry. I didn't mean you.

27:05.944 --> 27:08.711
- Sorry.
- Oh, oh.

27:08.713 --> 27:10.546
Oh, okay.

27:10.548 --> 27:12.348
- Come on.
- What?

27:12.350 --> 27:14.751
I just mean that you're not...

27:14.753 --> 27:16.686
- hideous.
- Oh, not hideous, wow.

27:16.688 --> 27:20.623
- Just would you... come on.
- Just keep it coming.

27:20.625 --> 27:23.826
You know you're beautiful, all right?

27:23.828 --> 27:26.496
What?

27:26.498 --> 27:30.366
I don't really think of myself that way.

27:30.368 --> 27:33.736
I've always seen myself
as more of a nerd.

27:33.738 --> 27:35.767
- I doubt that.
- No, I'm serious.

27:35.770 --> 27:39.074
I skipped my prom to attend a
speech and debate tournament.

27:39.077 --> 27:41.077
I regret nothing.

27:41.079 --> 27:44.376
- That's pretty nerdy.
- I know. I'm aware.

27:47.318 --> 27:50.158
I bet in high school, you were popular,

27:50.161 --> 27:53.963
who had all the girls
lined up around the block.

27:53.966 --> 27:57.934
"Hey, ladies."

27:57.937 --> 27:59.771
Uh...

27:59.774 --> 28:03.131
actually, I got caught
drinking on campus

28:03.134 --> 28:06.035
and barred from the prom.

28:06.037 --> 28:08.004
I was kind of lost back then.

28:12.143 --> 28:14.444
You saved my life, you know?

28:14.446 --> 28:16.673
Which time? The Alamo, Watergate?

28:16.676 --> 28:18.014
- I'm losing count.
- Oh, my God.

28:18.016 --> 28:19.782
That is not what I meant.

28:23.588 --> 28:26.489
You know why I took this assignment?

28:26.491 --> 28:29.358
Because it was dangerous.

28:29.360 --> 28:33.396
After Jessica died, I just sort of...

28:33.398 --> 28:36.833
sort of stopped caring, you know.

28:39.771 --> 28:41.237
But not anymore.

28:46.745 --> 28:50.704
When I was with my mother and...

28:50.707 --> 28:54.442
I thought you were dead, I...

28:54.445 --> 28:56.252
I felt the same way.

29:01.626 --> 29:02.925
Now?

30:18.311 --> 30:20.681
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

30:25.318 --> 30:28.553
Was last night... okay?

30:28.555 --> 30:29.787
It was great.

30:31.191 --> 30:34.726
No, I mean, you know...

30:34.728 --> 30:37.929
technically, we're... coworkers.

30:37.931 --> 30:39.564
Mm.

30:39.566 --> 30:41.065
Is this an HR issue?

30:41.067 --> 30:43.134
Well, we don't really

30:43.136 --> 30:46.003
have to, uh, announce it to everyone.

30:46.005 --> 30:47.572
We can just let it be our little secret

30:47.574 --> 30:49.392
till we're ready to...

30:51.611 --> 30:54.545
- Tell them.
- Oh!

30:54.547 --> 30:56.380
Yeah.

30:56.382 --> 30:58.564
I was looking for both of you.

30:58.567 --> 31:00.952
Well, here you are.

31:00.955 --> 31:03.048
And this is me leaving, so...

31:06.892 --> 31:09.226
- Busted.
- Nah.

31:09.229 --> 31:11.228
- He'll be cool.
- Yeah.

31:16.302 --> 31:18.402
What did the doctor say?

31:18.404 --> 31:21.272
He said...

31:21.274 --> 31:23.775
I'm fine.

31:23.777 --> 31:25.743
There's absolutely
nothing wrong with me.

31:25.745 --> 31:28.613
- What about these seizures?
- He brought in a portable MRI

31:28.615 --> 31:30.982
to scan my brain... No sign of stroke,

31:30.984 --> 31:32.917
clots, tumors, lesions of any kind.

31:32.919 --> 31:34.423
The weirdest part is,

31:34.426 --> 31:36.026
I've had a heart murmur my entire life.

31:36.029 --> 31:39.897
Kept me from running
track. But as of today...

31:39.900 --> 31:42.293
it's gone.

31:42.295 --> 31:43.761
What do you mean, it's gone?

31:43.763 --> 31:46.964
Somehow, my heart murmur was cured.

31:46.966 --> 31:51.269
- And what about the visions?
- They're still happening.

31:51.271 --> 31:54.619
But my brain is fine,
and my heart is fixed.

31:56.276 --> 31:57.843
Like I'm good as new.

31:59.969 --> 32:02.283
What the hell happened
to me on that "Lifeboat"?

32:10.423 --> 32:11.989
- So how was your night?
- Rufus.

32:11.991 --> 32:13.424
Don't worry. I'm not gonna tell anyone.

32:13.426 --> 32:16.027
Maybe Jiya, not Connor
or Agent Christopher.

32:16.029 --> 32:17.830
- Definitely Jiya.
- Can you be cool?

32:17.833 --> 32:19.497
So is this happening? Is it happening?

32:19.499 --> 32:21.232
- Be cool.
- Totally cool.

32:21.234 --> 32:23.845
Guys, guys, guys. Sorry I'm late.

32:23.848 --> 32:27.805
- You stole a new one.
- It's my favorite time period.

32:27.807 --> 32:30.374
There he is.

32:30.376 --> 32:32.677
All right, let's go.

32:59.372 --> 33:00.783
Is that everything?

33:00.786 --> 33:02.340
It's all six reels, everything.

33:06.946 --> 33:09.150
It's probably one of Hearst's guys.

33:09.153 --> 33:11.582
Hey, you can't be in here.

33:11.584 --> 33:12.717
This is a closed set.

33:14.554 --> 33:15.753
Hey, the film!

33:22.409 --> 33:25.062
- He's losing a lot of blood.
- Wait, wait, wait.

33:25.064 --> 33:28.032
Stay here. Be careful.

33:30.503 --> 33:33.069
I spent 15 years
building to this moment.

33:33.072 --> 33:34.906
15 damn years!

33:39.032 --> 33:40.644
What do we do?

33:40.647 --> 33:41.790
Wait, wait, wait.

33:41.793 --> 33:42.858
Where are you going?

34:11.643 --> 34:13.945
We can't be here to answer for this.

34:13.947 --> 34:16.013
Come on.

34:30.697 --> 34:32.897
Where's Lucy?

34:32.899 --> 34:35.599
Traveling.

34:35.601 --> 34:38.668
I don't see any release
papers for me to sign.

34:38.670 --> 34:40.041
You know it's not that simple.

34:40.043 --> 34:41.505
I knew you wouldn't honor the deal.

34:41.507 --> 34:43.239
You're classified as a terrorist.

34:43.242 --> 34:45.376
Plus, you just killed someone.

34:45.378 --> 34:47.011
Can't exactly call in a favor

34:47.013 --> 34:48.813
to get you out early for good behavior.

34:48.815 --> 34:50.514
Then you might as well kill me yourself.

34:50.516 --> 34:52.116
Oh, don't tempt me.

34:56.656 --> 34:58.956
As much as it pains me to admit it,

34:58.958 --> 35:01.525
we need your intel on
these sleeper agents

35:01.527 --> 35:03.060
to stop Rittenhouse.

35:08.468 --> 35:12.069
- What's this?
- Well, if you ask me,

35:12.071 --> 35:14.271
a very bad idea.

35:26.419 --> 35:28.319
Hey.

35:28.321 --> 35:30.888
I, uh, know you'll
make sure he gets these.

35:30.890 --> 35:33.424
You're not really friends
with Orson, are you?

35:33.426 --> 35:35.026
No.

35:35.028 --> 35:36.527
But I am a huge fan of his work.

35:36.529 --> 35:38.329
Aren't we all?

35:38.331 --> 35:40.231
Where shall I say I got them from?

35:40.233 --> 35:44.080
You're pretty much a genius.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

35:44.083 --> 35:46.203
Oh, one more thing.

35:46.205 --> 35:47.972
Your patent for frequency hopping?

35:47.974 --> 35:49.673
Yes, we plan to apply for it soon.

35:49.675 --> 35:51.909
Yeah, I'm pretty sure the
navy won't use it until 1962...

35:51.911 --> 35:55.646
If I had to take a
guess... So whatever you do,

35:55.648 --> 35:57.415
do not let that patent expire.

36:04.257 --> 36:07.580
- You sure no one's up there?
- Pretty sure.

36:07.583 --> 36:08.882
Prison was just built.

36:08.885 --> 36:10.361
I don't think anybody's in it yet.

36:10.363 --> 36:14.665
We got a long drive. No radio.

36:14.667 --> 36:17.902
Maybe you could sing us a song.

36:17.904 --> 36:21.126
That was, uh... terrifying.

36:21.129 --> 36:22.395
You looked like you were having

36:22.398 --> 36:23.436
a pretty good time up there.

36:23.438 --> 36:25.672
- I did?
- Yeah.

36:25.675 --> 36:28.909
It was, um...

36:28.912 --> 36:33.582
it was nice to see you happy.

36:33.585 --> 36:36.285
- Really?
- Yeah.

36:39.693 --> 36:41.158
Hey.

36:41.161 --> 36:43.595
How'd it go?

36:43.598 --> 36:45.861
"Citizen Kane" is in good hands.

36:45.864 --> 36:48.264
Also, I still got to agree
with Agent Christopher.

36:48.267 --> 36:50.330
- This is a terrible idea.
- My thoughts exactly.

36:50.333 --> 36:51.633
Either of you have a better idea?

36:51.635 --> 36:53.703
No? Didn't think so. Let's do this.

37:12.021 --> 37:13.377
This is the one.

37:13.380 --> 37:15.089
One, two, three, four, five,

37:15.091 --> 37:18.793
six, seven, eight, nine.

37:18.795 --> 37:20.594
This is it.

37:20.596 --> 37:22.730
- Right there?
- Mm-hmm.

37:22.732 --> 37:24.298
Rufus?

38:39.909 --> 38:43.044
- How you feeling?
- Fine.

38:43.046 --> 38:45.877
Really, I saw a doctor.

38:45.880 --> 38:47.881
I've literally never been healthier.

38:51.054 --> 38:54.855
- How'd it go?
- Uh, we stopped them.

38:54.857 --> 38:57.058
And dropped off the package.

38:57.060 --> 38:58.326
I know.

39:02.576 --> 39:05.066
To think I escaped prison for this.

39:10.920 --> 39:12.507
Just keep him on a leash.

39:15.781 --> 39:19.583
Hey, hey.

39:19.586 --> 39:22.249
- I know. I know.
- It's just seeing Flynn here

39:22.251 --> 39:23.917
with us...

39:23.920 --> 39:25.776
- I don't like it.
- I don't like it either.

39:25.779 --> 39:27.921
But he's on our side
now, and he can help us.

39:27.924 --> 39:29.723
Yeah, he can, but will he?

39:29.725 --> 39:31.492
I mean, he's got what
he wants, so now what?

39:31.494 --> 39:34.728
Now can we just forget
about Flynn for, like,

39:34.730 --> 39:39.066
a minute because we have each other?

39:39.068 --> 39:41.168
Don't we?

39:41.170 --> 39:44.505
Yes.

39:44.507 --> 39:48.309
I mean, the other night, it was...

39:48.311 --> 39:50.911
- It was pretty amazing.
- That's what I thought too.

39:50.913 --> 39:53.047
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:53.049 --> 39:55.850
- We agree.
- We do.

39:55.852 --> 39:57.918
- So...
- So...

39:57.920 --> 39:59.954
- What do we do now?
- Well, um,

39:59.956 --> 40:02.393
we're already living together,
so that's a pretty big step.

40:02.396 --> 40:03.643
Yeah.

40:03.646 --> 40:05.424
We've got nowhere to go but down.

40:05.427 --> 40:07.294
That's right.

40:07.297 --> 40:08.964
What?

40:11.634 --> 40:14.292
- I'll be... I'll be right back.
- O-okay.

40:14.295 --> 40:17.956
- Wait, Wyatt?
- Lucy, check this out!

40:21.010 --> 40:22.971
- What?
- Uh...

40:22.974 --> 40:25.578
so I told Hedy to renew her patent,

40:25.581 --> 40:28.883
which she did in 1955, so
that when the navy uses it

40:28.885 --> 40:34.155
in the 1962 blockade of Cuba,
Hedy and George still own it.

40:34.157 --> 40:35.556
- Glad they got the credit.
- Yeah.

40:35.558 --> 40:37.479
And about $30 billion to go with it.

40:37.482 --> 40:39.315
- $30 billion?
- Billion.

40:39.318 --> 40:41.017
She quit acting, started a tech company.

40:41.020 --> 40:42.453
According to Wikipedia,

40:42.456 --> 40:44.899
Bill Gates ain't got
nothing on Hedy Lamarr.

40:47.654 --> 40:50.862
- What's that?
- Someone broke in.

40:50.865 --> 40:52.480
Did Rittenhouse track Flynn here?

40:52.483 --> 40:54.049
Either that, or he double-crossed us.

40:54.052 --> 40:56.653
- Where are your guns?
- You wish. Follow me.

41:16.399 --> 41:18.599
What?

41:18.601 --> 41:20.367
Nobody broke in.

41:20.369 --> 41:22.970
They broke out.

41:22.972 --> 41:24.305
Wyatt?

41:58.041 --> 41:59.768
Jessica?

42:02.379 --> 42:05.447
Oh, my God.

42:05.450 --> 42:08.315
You're actually here.

42:17.660 --> 42:18.792
You're actually here.
