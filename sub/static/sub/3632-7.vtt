I'm Lily.

12:05.139 --> 12:06.872
I'll be right back to take your order.

12:06.874 --> 12:08.173
- Okay.
- Thanks.

12:19.419 --> 12:21.120
When the Mutts attacked you here,

12:21.122 --> 12:22.487
how did it feel?

12:22.489 --> 12:25.590
Fighting for your life,
protecting your home?

12:25.592 --> 12:28.761
We did what we had to do.

12:28.763 --> 12:31.063
Wasn't our choice, but it was our fight.

12:32.866 --> 12:34.066
What would you have done?

12:34.068 --> 12:36.101
Hunted down each and every Mutt.

12:36.103 --> 12:37.569
Kill them all.

12:37.571 --> 12:39.638
Even those who weren't involved?
An iron fist.

12:39.640 --> 12:41.939
It's the only way to deal with revolt.

12:44.310 --> 12:45.644
Jeremy: Please,

12:45.646 --> 12:47.279
take your time, enjoy my grounds

12:47.281 --> 12:48.513
until you have to leave.

12:48.515 --> 12:49.847
Well, if you'll excuse me

12:49.849 --> 12:51.249
I'm going to head back in to the others.

12:51.251 --> 12:54.252
You think you float above it all.

12:54.254 --> 12:56.520
Your estate, your paintings,

12:56.522 --> 12:58.722
your precious Elena.

12:58.724 --> 13:01.125
Goodbye, Eduardo.

13:01.127 --> 13:02.894
You killed my Alpha.

13:02.896 --> 13:05.229
Here. In your house.

13:05.231 --> 13:07.698
Be very, very careful
what you're saying.

13:07.700 --> 13:10.834
But why didn't you bring it
up with the other Alphas?

13:10.836 --> 13:14.104
Because you killed him impulsively.

13:14.106 --> 13:15.806
Then you covered it up.

13:15.808 --> 13:18.475
An accusation without
proof is just a story,

13:18.477 --> 13:20.143

13:20.145 --> 13:22.646

fairy tale to the Alpha Council?

13:22.648 --> 13:25.349
I'd be delighted to watch you fall.

13:25.351 --> 13:29.920
I have something more
important than proof.

13:29.922 --> 13:32.088
Your Nick Sorrentino.

13:32.090 --> 13:33.723
Did you know he just arrived

13:33.725 --> 13:35.591
in a tiny town called Hawkesbury.

13:35.593 --> 13:37.928
With a woman.

If you'd like to see him again,
you will do something for me.

13:42.367 --> 13:46.402
By the end of the day, you
will kill Roman Navikev.

13:48.880 --> 13:50.840
Do you think that I want
to kill the Russian Alpha

13:50.842 --> 13:54.076
and start a war because
you threatened me?

I had to take control of my life.

18:27.724 --> 18:30.459

25:16.436 --> 25:18.337
What's going on?

25:18.339 --> 25:21.005
Lily: When you came to the restaurant,

25:21.007 --> 25:23.808
I figured you must know.

25:23.810 --> 25:25.710
And that you came for a reason.

25:25.712 --> 25:27.345
I waited for you to say something,

25:27.347 --> 25:31.249
and when you didn't,
I thought maybe I was wrong.

25:31.251 --> 25:34.552

coincidence that you're here,

25:34.554 --> 25:36.487

leave without telling you.

25:38.791 --> 25:41.759

25:41.761 --> 25:43.527
You're my son,

25:43.529 --> 25:45.062
Nick.

25:45.064 --> 25:47.131

25:51.036 --> 25:53.270

25:56.809 --> 25:58.308

25:59.444 --> 26:03.046

26:03.048 --> 26:05.348
I'm sorry...

26:05.350 --> 26:06.617

I will tell the other Alphas.

37:04.700 --> 37:06.499
You have my word.

37:06.501 --> 37:08.736
And the girl,

37:08.738 --> 37:12.472
I will decide what happens to her.

37:12.474 --> 37:14.708
As you said, this is your territory.

37:14.710 --> 37:17.344
You make the decisions.

37:17.346 --> 37:19.112
The world is changing.

37:19.114 --> 37:20.413
We have to change with it.

37:20.415 --> 37:21.715
(Clears throat)

37:24.184 --> 37:26.819
I'm not sure that's the answer.

37:28.822 --> 37:31.491
(Speaking in Russian)

37:40.200 --> 37:42.135
Jeremy.

37:42.137 --> 37:44.403
Clay told me on the phone:

37:44.405 --> 37:47.006
Eduardo wanted you
to be part of his plan.

37:47.008 --> 37:51.243
I never would have
worked for the Spanish.

37:51.245 --> 37:53.279
I know that.

37:53.281 --> 37:57.349
Their wine can be so... unctuous.

37:57.351 --> 37:59.851
(Laughing)

38:06.592 --> 38:09.027
We have to know who we can trust.

38:17.369 --> 38:18.636
(Door opens)

38:21.240 --> 38:23.374
Nick, thank God you're safe.

38:23.376 --> 38:24.575
Lily, I...

38:24.577 --> 38:27.679
Please, let me talk.

38:27.681 --> 38:28.946
Please.

38:40.859 --> 38:42.793
I know who you are, Nick.

38:44.296 --> 38:47.631
And I know what you are, too.

38:47.633 --> 38:52.602
I know because I saw
your father transform.

38:52.604 --> 38:55.839
When you were born,

38:55.841 --> 38:57.708
he told me he had to leave.

38:59.377 --> 39:02.646
To keep you safe.

39:02.648 --> 39:05.382
To keep me alive.

39:05.384 --> 39:09.018
It was the hardest thing
I have ever done.

39:09.020 --> 39:10.320
But I understood.

39:14.058 --> 39:17.593
You thought that maybe
he'd be able to come back.

39:17.595 --> 39:18.761
(Sighing)

39:18.763 --> 39:21.597
He wanted to send me money.

39:21.599 --> 39:24.901
To make sure I was okay.

39:24.903 --> 39:29.739
But to be safe, to be sure,

39:29.741 --> 39:31.340
I told him I could make it on my own

39:31.342 --> 39:36.178
as long as he sent me
a picture every year.

39:39.249 --> 39:41.550
This was the first year he missed.

39:47.056 --> 39:48.390
- He's dead, Lily.
- No.

39:48.392 --> 39:49.691
I'm sorry.

39:52.095 --> 39:53.395
I'm sorry.

39:55.631 --> 39:59.935
His last words to me were your name.

39:59.937 --> 40:02.203
He wanted me to come find you.

40:04.139 --> 40:06.207
But now that I'm here,
I wish that I hadn't come,

40:06.209 --> 40:08.476
because I brought so much
danger into your life.

40:08.478 --> 40:10.177
- I mean...
- No, no, no.

40:10.179 --> 40:11.946
A happy moment with you...

40:14.082 --> 40:16.684
is worth all the heartbreak in the world.

40:16.686 --> 40:19.453
(Quiet sobs)

40:19.455 --> 40:21.789
I loved your father.

40:21.791 --> 40:24.258
And I will always love you.

40:26.395 --> 40:27.929
My boy.

40:30.132 --> 40:33.567
All these years, I have kept his secret.

40:35.102 --> 40:37.404
And I will do the same for you.

40:38.740 --> 40:40.006
For us.

40:42.444 --> 40:45.345
Both: (Sobbing)

41:03.597 --> 41:05.498
I can never come back.

41:07.168 --> 41:09.969
I can't risk it.

41:09.971 --> 41:11.537
For both of us.

41:11.539 --> 41:12.805
I know.

41:16.109 --> 41:19.011
Goodbye, my boy.

41:19.013 --> 41:20.279
My Nick.

41:56.248 --> 41:59.150
What you did to that man

41:59.152 --> 42:00.918
wasn't your fault.

42:02.587 --> 42:05.223
He put you in that position.

You're chasing the wrong enemy.

It's not the other wolves
you need to worry about.

42:42.294 --> 42:44.227
We killed you.

43:00.078 --> 43:02.879
Oh, I don't think so.

43:02.881 --> 43:04.213
I mean, Savannah's powers

43:04.215 --> 43:05.814
seem like they're out of control.

43:05.816 --> 43:08.451
I'm sure Ruth and Paige will be worried.

43:08.453 --> 43:11.019
They'll probably come here,
try to protect her.

43:11.021 --> 43:15.257
And then, with your help,

43:15.259 --> 43:16.825
I'll get what I need.
