THE SADDEST MAN CAVE EVER

00:37.170 --> 00:38.229
LOOK, IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK,

WITH THE CORONAVIRUS, THE

UNITED STATES, COVID

01:02.030 --> 01:03.200
CASES HAVE CONTINUED TO CLIMB,

01:03.219 --> 01:04.180
AND A DEBATE OVER WHAT TO DO

01:04.200 --> 01:06.010
ABOUT SCHOOLS HAS BEEN

01:06.030 --> 01:07.170
DOMINATING THE NEWS AFTER

01:07.189 --> 01:08.109
KICKING INTO HIGH GEAR A LITTLE

01:08.129 --> 01:10.090
OVER A WEEK AGO.

01:10.109 --> 01:12.000
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP TONIGHT ONCE

01:12.019 --> 01:13.099
AGAIN AT ODDS WITH HIS OWN

01:13.120 --> 01:14.159
MEDICAL EXPERTS AS HE CONTINUES

01:14.180 --> 01:16.000
TO RELENTLESSLY PUSH AMERICA'S

01:16.019 --> 01:17.189
SCHOOLS TO REOPEN.

01:17.210 --> 01:18.079
>> OUR SCHOOLS, WE WANT 'EM OPEN

01:18.099 --> 01:19.159
IN THE FALL.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.060
>> HE'S ALSO THREATENING TO

01:21.079 --> 01:26.079
DEFUND SCHOOLS THAT DON'T OPEN,

01:26.099 --> 01:27.129
THOUGH HE HAS LITTLE POWER TO DO

01:27.150 --> 01:28.010
SO, AND CRITICIZING THE CDC'S

01:28.030 --> 01:32.229
SCHOOL SAFETY GUIDELINES,

01:32.250 --> 01:33.159
CALLING THEM "VERY TOUGH AND

01:33.180 --> 01:34.020
EXPENSIVE."

01:34.039 --> 01:35.079
>> WE DON'T WANT THE GUIDANCE

01:35.099 --> 01:35.250
FROM CDC TO BE A REASON WHY

01:35.270 --> 01:36.109
SCHOOLS DON'T OPEN.

01:36.129 --> 01:37.229
>> John: MIKE PENCE DOESN'T

01:37.250 --> 01:39.060
THINK CDC GUIDELINES SHOULD

01:39.079 --> 01:45.039
IMPEDE SCHOOLS OPENING?

01:45.060 --> 01:45.280
THEN WHAT EXACTLY ARE THEY FOR?

01:46.000 --> 01:46.129
THESE ARE PUBLIC HEALTH

01:46.150 --> 01:47.039
GUIDELINES.

01:47.060 --> 01:47.200
THEY SHOULDN'T BE SKIMMED

01:47.219 --> 01:48.159
THROUGH AND ULTIMATELY DEEMED

01:48.180 --> 01:49.069
INCONSEQUENTIAL TO OUR CURRENT

01:49.090 --> 01:49.150
SITUATION.

01:49.170 --> 01:50.060
THEY'RE NOT MARY TRUMP'S BOOK.

01:50.079 --> 01:51.109
AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S

01:51.129 --> 01:53.039
INSISTENCE THAT SCHOOLS SHOULD

01:53.060 --> 01:53.270
REOPEN FULL-TIME FOR IN-PERSON

01:53.289 --> 01:55.109
LEARNING, REGARDLESS OF LOCAL

01:55.129 --> 01:57.240
VIRUS SPREAD, HAS PROMPTED

01:57.259 --> 02:00.000
QUESTIONS LIKE "WHAT?," "HOW?,"

02:00.019 --> 02:00.189
"THE FUCK?," AND "THE FUCK?"

02:00.209 --> 02:01.140
AGAIN, BUT WITH MORE

02:01.159 --> 02:02.219
QUESTION MARKS.

02:02.239 --> 02:03.250
ALTHOUGH SOME IN THE

02:03.269 --> 02:04.260
ADMINISTRATION CLAIM IT REALLY

02:04.280 --> 02:05.290
SHOULDN'T BE AN ISSUE.

02:06.010 --> 02:07.200
>> JUST GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

02:07.219 --> 02:09.150
WE CAN DO THAT.

02:09.169 --> 02:10.120
AND, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN SOCIAL

02:10.139 --> 02:12.050
DISTANCE, YOU CAN GET YOUR

02:12.069 --> 02:13.150
TEMPERATURE TAKEN, YOU CAN BE

02:13.169 --> 02:14.219
TESTED, YOU COULD HAVE

02:14.240 --> 02:15.240
DISTANCING.

02:15.259 --> 02:18.039
COME ON, IT'S NOT THAT HARD.

02:18.060 --> 02:19.129
>> John: OKAY, REAL QUICK:

02:19.150 --> 02:20.129
FUCK YOU, LARRY KUDLOW, YOU

02:20.150 --> 02:22.090
HUMAN CUFFLINK.

02:22.110 --> 02:23.229
YOU CAN'T TELL PEOPLE TO

02:23.250 --> 02:25.000
"JUST GO BACK TO SCHOOL" WITHOUT

02:25.020 --> 02:28.229
ANSWERING QUESTIONS AROUND

02:28.250 --> 02:29.259
HOW THAT CAN HAPPEN SAFELY.

02:29.280 --> 02:30.150
IN FACT, THE ONLY QUESTION THAT

02:30.170 --> 02:31.099
KUDLOW'S ANSWERING EFFECTIVELY

02:31.120 --> 02:31.270
THERE IS, WHAT WOULD IT WOULD

02:31.289 --> 02:33.079
LOOK LIKE IF SOMEONE MADE

02:33.099 --> 02:34.280
RUDY GIULIANI EXACTLY

02:35.000 --> 02:37.050
0.001% HOTTER?

02:37.069 --> 02:38.060
BECAUSE SAFELY RE-OPENING

02:38.079 --> 02:39.050
SCHOOLS IS GOING TO BE

02:39.069 --> 02:43.099
INCREDIBLY HARD.

02:43.120 --> 02:45.039
THEY'RE NOT DESIGNED FOR SOCIAL

02:45.060 --> 02:46.000
DISTANCING, AND YEARS OF BUDGET

02:46.020 --> 02:48.000
CUTS AND THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN

02:48.020 --> 02:48.180
ARE GOING TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT

02:48.199 --> 02:49.069
FOR THEM TO UPGRADE THEIR

02:49.090 --> 02:50.000
FACILITIES.

02:50.020 --> 02:51.289
AND WHILE THIS ADMINISTRATION

02:52.009 --> 02:52.270
HAS REPEATEDLY IMPLIED KIDS ARE

02:52.289 --> 02:54.079
AT LOW RISK OF SEVERE ILLNESS,

02:54.099 --> 02:55.099
A, WE ABSOLUTELY DO NOT KNOW

02:55.120 --> 02:56.259
THAT, AND B, YOU KNOW SCHOOLS

02:56.280 --> 02:57.170
DON'T JUST CONTAIN CHILDREN,

02:57.189 --> 02:59.050
RIGHT?

02:59.069 --> 03:00.120
LOTS OF ADULTS WORK IN SCHOOLS,

03:00.139 --> 03:01.210
MANY OF WHOM ARE VULNERABLE.

03:01.229 --> 03:03.050
IN FACT, NEARLY A THIRD OF

03:03.069 --> 03:05.030
K THROUGH 12 TEACHERS MAY BE AT

03:05.050 --> 03:07.050
HIGHER RISK FROM THE VIRUS

03:07.069 --> 03:08.139
BECAUSE THEY'RE OVER 50, SOME OF

03:08.159 --> 03:09.250
WHOM ARE PAINFULLY AWARE OF THE

03:09.270 --> 03:11.270
RISKS THEY'RE ABOUT TO TAKE.

03:11.289 --> 03:14.069
>> MARY STRICKLAND HAS BEEN

03:14.090 --> 03:16.069
TEACHING MIDDLE SCHOOL 22 YEARS

03:16.090 --> 03:17.110
AND SHE LOVES IT, BUT THE SIGN

03:17.129 --> 03:18.120
OUTSIDE HER FORT WORTH HOME

03:18.139 --> 03:19.139
DESCRIBES HOW THE 53-YEAR-OLD

03:19.159 --> 03:21.000
FEELS ABOUT GOING BACK.

03:21.020 --> 03:22.090
TERRIFIED.

03:22.110 --> 03:25.050
FEARING THE WORST, SHE'S MAKING

03:25.069 --> 03:26.060
END-OF-LIFE PLANS.

03:26.079 --> 03:29.039
>> I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT MY

03:29.060 --> 03:31.050
HEALTH, ABOUT MY LIFE, AND

03:31.069 --> 03:32.199
THAT'S WHY MY HUSBAND AND I

03:32.219 --> 03:35.210
DECIDED TO WRITE OUR WILLS.

03:35.229 --> 03:38.099
>> John: THAT'S AWFUL.

03:38.120 --> 03:39.099
TEACHERS SHOULD NOT GO TO WORK

03:39.120 --> 03:39.250
SCARED THEY MIGHT DIE.

03:39.270 --> 03:40.189
THEY SHOULD BE SCARED OF THE

03:40.210 --> 03:42.009
USUAL TEACHER THINGS, LIKE NOT

03:42.030 --> 03:43.069
MAKING ENOUGH MONEY TO EAT OR

03:43.090 --> 03:44.150
BEING MADE INTO A TIKTOK MEME BY

03:44.170 --> 03:46.020
ONE OF THEIR STUDENTS.

03:46.039 --> 03:47.180
"I BENT OVER IN FRONT OF THE

03:47.199 --> 03:48.099
SKELETON TO PICK UP MY PENCIL,

03:48.120 --> 03:49.110
AND NOW 10 MILLION PEOPLE ARE

03:49.129 --> 03:50.159
WATCHING A VIDEO OF ME GETTING

03:50.180 --> 03:51.229
DRILLED DOGGY STYLE BY A

03:51.250 --> 03:56.240
BONE MAN TO 'OLD TOWN ROAD.'

03:56.259 --> 03:58.090
I HATE MY FUCKING LIFE."

03:58.110 --> 03:59.159
SO THIS IS A TOUGH, COMPLICATED

03:59.180 --> 04:00.099
SITUATION THAT REQUIRES NUANCED

04:00.120 --> 04:00.280
THINKING.

04:01.000 --> 04:01.159
WHICH IS WHY IT'S SO MADDENING

04:01.180 --> 04:02.039
TO SEE IT REDUCED TO TALKING

04:02.060 --> 04:03.219
POINTS LIKE THIS:

04:03.240 --> 04:05.129
>> I CAN PROMISE YOU FOR MANY OF

04:05.150 --> 04:07.129
OUR KIDS, KEEPING THESE SCHOOLS

04:07.150 --> 04:09.199
CLOSED IS GONNA HURT THEM FAR

04:09.219 --> 04:12.280
WORSE THAN THE CORONAVIRUS CAN.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.290
FRANCE, GERMANY --

04:17.009 --> 04:18.199
>> GO AHEAD, SIR.

04:18.220 --> 04:20.009
>> DENMARK, AUSTRIA, VIETNAM --

04:20.029 --> 04:22.149
EVEN VIETNAM HAS OPENED THEIR

04:22.170 --> 04:23.199
SCHOOLS.

04:23.220 --> 04:24.250
AND WE -- AND THEY'VE DONE IT

04:24.269 --> 04:26.019
SAFELY AND WE CAN TOO AND WE

04:26.040 --> 04:28.279
SHOULD TOO.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
>> John: WELL, FIRST OF ALL, THE

04:30.019 --> 04:30.180
SENATOR'S ROCKING A LOOK THERE

04:30.199 --> 04:31.160
THAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS

04:31.180 --> 04:34.000
OPEN CASKET REALNESS.

04:34.019 --> 04:34.189
BUT SECOND, HE CAN SNEER ALL HE

04:34.209 --> 04:35.170
WANTS ABOUT HOW OTHER COUNTRIES

04:35.189 --> 04:37.209
HAVE DONE THIS --

04:37.230 --> 04:38.180
"EVEN VIETNAM."

04:38.199 --> 04:39.220
BUT THE FACT IS, THEY'VE

04:39.240 --> 04:41.199
REOPENED UNDER VERY DIFFERENT

04:41.220 --> 04:42.269
CIRCUMSTANCES, GRADUALLY, AND

04:42.290 --> 04:43.250
WHEN DAILY CASE RATES WERE LOW

04:43.269 --> 04:47.139
AND DROPPING.

04:47.159 --> 04:50.009
WHEN VIETNAM REOPENED THEIR

04:50.029 --> 04:51.189
SCHOOLS, IT HAD SEEN NO

04:51.209 --> 04:53.269
COMMUNITY INFECTIONS FOR NEARLY

04:53.290 --> 04:55.069
A MONTH, WHEREAS OUR NEW DAILY

04:55.090 --> 04:55.250
CASES HAVE REACHED 77,000 AND

04:55.269 --> 04:56.129
RISING.

04:56.149 --> 04:57.209
BUT I'LL GIVE HIM THIS: THERE IS

04:57.230 --> 04:58.220
REAL HARM IN NOT BEING ABLE TO

04:58.240 --> 04:59.269
REOPEN SCHOOLS.

04:59.290 --> 05:01.110
AT-HOME LEARNING IS A POOR

05:01.129 --> 05:02.120
SUBSTITUTE, ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE

05:02.139 --> 05:04.139
WITH LIMITED INTERNET ACCESS,

05:04.160 --> 05:05.250
OR WHO REQUIRE SPECIALIZED

05:05.269 --> 05:06.189
SUPPORT -- AND SOME KIDS RELY ON

05:06.209 --> 05:08.000
SCHOOLS FOR IMPORTANT RESOURCES,

05:08.019 --> 05:10.000
LIKE MEALS.

05:10.019 --> 05:11.170
PLUS, PARENTS ARE BURDENED,

05:11.189 --> 05:13.060
ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO CAN'T WORK

05:13.079 --> 05:14.029
REMOTELY AND WHO HAVE FEW

05:14.050 --> 05:16.009
OPTIONS WHEN IT COMES TO

05:16.029 --> 05:17.189
CHILDCARE, A STRESS THAT FALLS

05:17.209 --> 05:18.139
DISPROPORTIONATELY ON WOMEN,

05:18.160 --> 05:20.100
ESPECIALLY WOMEN OF COLOR.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.100
EVEN THOSE LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE

05:21.120 --> 05:22.199
ABLE TO WORK FROM HOME ARE

05:22.220 --> 05:23.250
FINDING THIS STRESSFUL AND BADLY

05:23.269 --> 05:26.029
WANT THEIR KIDS BACK IN SCHOOL.

05:26.050 --> 05:28.209
TRUST ME, I LOVE MY KIDS MORE

05:28.230 --> 05:30.009
THAN ANYTHING, BUT I'D SEND THEM

05:30.029 --> 05:31.240
TO GO STUDY IN JAKE PAUL'S HOUSE

05:31.259 --> 05:32.230
IF IT MEANT I COULD HAVE MY

05:32.250 --> 05:34.129
MORNINGS BACK.

05:34.149 --> 05:35.230
BUT WE HAVEN'T MADE THE ISSUE OF

05:35.250 --> 05:37.199
SCHOOLS REOPENING A PRIORITY,

05:37.220 --> 05:39.019
SOMETHING ACTUALLY BEST SUMMED

05:39.040 --> 05:40.189
UP BY FLORIDA GOVERNOR

05:40.209 --> 05:42.000
RON DeSANTIS, WHOSE STATE IS

05:42.019 --> 05:43.149
PUMPING OUT CASES FASTER THAN

05:43.170 --> 05:45.250
ANYWHERE RIGHT NOW.

05:45.269 --> 05:47.139
LISTEN TO HIM EXPLAIN WHY

05:47.159 --> 05:50.009
REOPENING SCHOOLS HAS TO BE

05:50.029 --> 05:50.290
DONE FOR THE SAKE OF

05:51.009 --> 05:52.149
CONSISTENCY.

05:52.170 --> 05:53.279
>> WE SPENT MONTHS SAYING THAT

05:54.000 --> 05:54.230
THERE WERE CERTAIN THINGS THAT

05:54.250 --> 05:55.170
WERE ESSENTIAL.

05:55.189 --> 05:56.209
THAT INCLUDED FAST-FOOD

05:56.230 --> 05:58.069
RESTAURANTS, IT INCLUDED

05:58.090 --> 06:02.240
WALMART, IT INCLUDED HOME DEPOT.

06:02.259 --> 06:04.079
IF ALL THAT IS ESSENTIAL, THEN

06:04.100 --> 06:05.209
EDUCATING OUR KIDS IS ABSOLUTELY

06:05.230 --> 06:06.230
ESSENTIAL, AND THEY HAVE BEEN

06:06.250 --> 06:08.050
PUT TO THE BACK OF THE LINE IN

06:08.069 --> 06:10.079
SOME RESPECTS.

06:10.100 --> 06:11.250
>> John: HE'S ACTUALLY RIGHT.

06:11.269 --> 06:12.170
WE HAVE PRIORITIZED THINGS LIKE

06:12.189 --> 06:13.259
OPENING RESTAURANTS AND BARS

06:13.279 --> 06:17.170
AHEAD OF OUR CHILDREN.

06:17.189 --> 06:18.209
AND MANY ADVISED THAT WE GO A

06:18.230 --> 06:19.240
LOT SLOWER, WHILE UNFORTUNATELY

06:19.259 --> 06:21.189
THE RON DeSANTII OF THE WORLD

06:21.209 --> 06:24.040
IGNORED THAT ADVICE, SAYING

06:24.060 --> 06:25.100
THINGS LIKE "GO ENJOY, HAVE A

06:25.120 --> 06:26.259
DRINK, IT'S FINE."

06:26.279 --> 06:28.120
AND IT IS ALMOST IMPRESSIVE TO

06:28.139 --> 06:30.040
WATCH A SITTING GOVERNOR TRY AND

06:30.060 --> 06:31.089
MAKE THE ARGUMENT "WE WERE

06:31.110 --> 06:32.090
REALLY DUMB THEN, SO THE ONLY

06:32.110 --> 06:33.240
FAIR THING IS TO ALSO BE REALLY

06:33.259 --> 06:34.199
DUMB NOW."

06:34.220 --> 06:36.060
BECAUSE SCHOOLS DON'T EXIST IN A

06:36.079 --> 06:37.290
VACUUM.

06:38.009 --> 06:40.009
AND THE BEST WAY TO REOPEN

06:40.029 --> 06:41.259
SCHOOLS SAFELY IS -- IF I MAY

06:41.279 --> 06:42.159
QUOTE ASHISH JHA, THE DIRECTOR

06:42.180 --> 06:43.259
OF THE HARVARD GLOBAL HEALTH

06:43.279 --> 06:45.029
INSTITUTE -- "LIVE IN A

06:45.050 --> 06:46.040
COMMUNITY THAT DOESN'T HAVE A

06:46.060 --> 06:47.090
BIG DISEASE OUTBREAK.

06:47.110 --> 06:48.230
THAT'S HOW YOU OPEN UP SCHOOLS

06:48.250 --> 06:50.050
SAFELY."

06:50.069 --> 06:52.000
SO MANY OF THE DECISIONS THAT

06:52.019 --> 06:53.159
COULD MAKE SCHOOLS SAFE INVOLVE

06:53.180 --> 06:54.279
WHAT WE ALL DO OUTSIDE OF THEM.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.100
AND THE FRUSTRATING THING IS,

06:56.120 --> 06:58.069
THE GOVERNMENT COULD BE HELPING

06:58.090 --> 06:59.220
THERE WITH THINGS LIKE

06:59.240 --> 07:02.000
CONSISTENT MESSAGING ON THE

07:02.019 --> 07:04.220
IMPORTANCE OF WEARING MASKS,

07:04.240 --> 07:05.250
AND POSSIBLY RE-CLOSING SOME

07:05.269 --> 07:07.069
NON-ESSENTIAL BUSINESSES,

07:07.089 --> 07:07.259
WHILE, IMPORTANTLY, MAKING SURE

07:07.279 --> 07:09.000
PEOPLE ARE PAID A LIVING WAGE TO

07:09.019 --> 07:12.089
STAY AT HOME.

07:12.110 --> 07:13.139
BECAUSE OUR RESPONSE HERE IS

07:13.160 --> 07:15.060
ONLY GOING TO BE AS STRONG AS

07:15.079 --> 07:16.110
OUR WEAKEST LINK, AND OTHER

07:16.129 --> 07:16.290
COUNTRIES -- FRANCE, GERMANY,

07:17.009 --> 07:18.180
DENMARK, AUSTRIA --

07:18.199 --> 07:19.230
EVEN VIETNAM! -- KNOW THIS.

07:19.250 --> 07:23.180
WHY?

07:23.199 --> 07:26.279
WELL, BECAUSE UNDERSTANDING

07:27.000 --> 07:27.129
IS -- IF I MAY QUOTE

07:27.149 --> 07:27.240
LARRY KUDLOW --

07:27.259 --> 07:28.199
NOT THAT FUCKING HARD.

07:28.220 --> 07:33.170
AND NOW, THIS.

07:33.189 --> 07:34.129
>> Announcer: AND NOW, PARENTS

07:34.149 --> 07:36.250
ON TELEVISION JUST WANT ONE

07:36.269 --> 07:37.009
THING.

07:37.029 --> 07:39.170

07:49.230 --> 07:51.040
SPEAK ONE OF THOSE SURVEYS THEY

07:51.060 --> 07:53.079
SENT OUT, TAKE MY KIDS.

07:53.100 --> 07:55.019
>> PLEASE TAKE MY CHILDREN.

07:55.040 --> 07:58.069
>> GOT TO GET MY DAUGHTER OUT OF

07:58.090 --> 07:58.180
THE HOUSE.

08:01.110 --> 08:02.250
PLEASE SEND THE CARDS BACK TO

08:02.269 --> 08:03.120
SCHOOL.

08:03.139 --> 08:06.259
>> YOU ARE HAVING A DAY THERE IN

08:06.279 --> 08:07.120
YOUR HOUSEHOLD.

08:07.139 --> 08:12.060

08:12.079 --> 08:12.250
EARLIER?

08:12.269 --> 08:14.029
>> John: MOVING ON.

08:14.050 --> 08:15.110
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

08:15.129 --> 08:16.060
CONSPIRACY THEORIES, VOTED

08:16.079 --> 08:16.199
"DEFINITELY TRUE" BY

08:16.220 --> 08:17.209
"DIPSHIT UNCLE QUARTERLY."

08:17.230 --> 08:18.100
YOU'RE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH AT

08:18.120 --> 08:19.160
LEAST SOME CONSPIRACY THEORIES,

08:19.180 --> 08:20.110
LIKE THE CLAIM THAT THE

08:20.129 --> 08:21.139
MOON LANDING WAS FAKED OR THE

08:21.160 --> 08:22.170
ARGUMENT THAT THE EARTH IS FLAT

08:22.189 --> 08:24.250
AND SCIENTISTS ARE COVERING IT

08:24.269 --> 08:25.170
UP, A THEORY THAT LED TO THIS

08:25.189 --> 08:26.220
ABSOLUTELY STUNNING YOUTUBE

08:26.240 --> 08:30.040

INACCURACIES, SLANT RHYMES,

09:01.200 --> 09:02.139
SHOEHORNED LYRICS, AND THE BAD

09:02.159 --> 09:06.230
ADELE OR SOLID BJORK IMPRESSION,

09:06.250 --> 09:08.169
MY FAVORITE PART OF THAT IS THE

09:08.190 --> 09:09.039
COMMENT, "HOLY CRAP, THIS IS

09:09.059 --> 09:09.220
AMAZING!

09:09.240 --> 09:10.110

THE WORLD!"

09:11.029 --> 09:13.129
WHICH IS, QUITE SIMPLY, PERFECT.

09:13.149 --> 09:15.279
BUT AS YOU'VE PROBABLY GUESSED,

09:16.000 --> 09:19.139
THE REASON THAT WE NEED TO TALK

09:19.159 --> 09:20.070
ABOUT THIS IS THAT THE

09:20.090 --> 09:20.279
CORONAVIRUS HAS CREATED A

09:21.000 --> 09:21.220
PERFECT STORM FOR CONSPIRACY

09:21.240 --> 09:22.080
THEORISTS, BECAUSE THEIR

09:22.100 --> 09:23.110
THEORIES ARE EVERYWHERE.

09:23.129 --> 09:24.100
>> OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS, SOME

09:24.120 --> 09:25.059
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING ONLINE

09:25.080 --> 09:26.149
THAT THE VIRUS IS HARMLESS OR

09:26.169 --> 09:29.250
EVEN THAT IT DOESN'T EXIST.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.220
>> NUMEROUS SITES AND GROUPS

09:31.240 --> 09:32.230
ONLINE HAVE BEEN FALSELY

09:32.250 --> 09:34.110
CLAIMING THAT THIS VIRUS IS A

09:34.129 --> 09:35.059
RESULT OF SOME SORT OF

09:35.080 --> 09:36.159
BIOLOGICAL WARFARE, SOME

09:36.179 --> 09:37.240
SORT OF BIOWEAPON, OR EVEN

09:37.259 --> 09:39.120
CREATED BY THE PHARMACEUTICAL

09:39.139 --> 09:40.210
INDUSTRY TO TRY TO SELL MORE

09:40.230 --> 09:42.039
VACCINES.

09:42.059 --> 09:43.129
>> ONE PARTICULARLY PERSISTENT

09:43.149 --> 09:45.039
FALSEHOOD?

09:45.059 --> 09:46.139
5G MOBILE NETWORKS TRANSMIT

09:46.159 --> 09:48.259
COVID-19.

09:48.279 --> 09:49.250
>> YOU KNOW, WHEN THEY TURN THIS

09:49.269 --> 09:51.059
ON, IT'S GONNA KILL EVERYONE.

09:51.080 --> 09:52.210
>> A WOMAN IN BRITAIN CALLED

09:52.230 --> 09:54.019
WORKERS "KILLERS" FOR LAYING 5G

09:54.039 --> 09:55.029
FIBEROPTIC CABLES.

09:55.049 --> 09:56.129
>> WHEN THEY TURN THAT SWITCH

09:56.149 --> 09:57.220
ON, BYE-BYE, MAMA.

09:57.240 --> 09:58.200
>> John: OKAY.

09:58.220 --> 10:00.000
THERE IS SO MUCH WRONG THERE,

10:00.019 --> 10:01.200
BUT MOST OF ALL, THE ONLY TIME

10:01.220 --> 10:03.149
AN ENGLISH PERSON SHOULD BE

10:03.169 --> 10:04.240
SAYING "BYE-BYE, MAMA," IS WHEN

10:04.259 --> 10:05.120
THEY'RE PHYSICALLY LEAVING THE

10:05.139 --> 10:05.190
WOMB.

10:05.210 --> 10:06.149
"BYE-BYE, MAMA.

10:06.169 --> 10:07.129
THANK YOU FOR AN EXCELLENT

10:07.149 --> 10:07.289
DELIVERY."

10:08.009 --> 10:09.080
AND AFTER THAT IT'S,

10:09.100 --> 10:09.259
"YES, MA'AM," "NO, MA'AM," AND

10:09.279 --> 10:10.279
"THANK YOU KINDLY FOR WIPING OFF

10:11.000 --> 10:12.159
MY SHAMEFUL BUTTOCKS, MUCH

10:12.179 --> 10:14.110
OBLIGED."

10:14.129 --> 10:16.000
AND THOSE THEORIES ARE JUST THE

10:16.019 --> 10:18.049
TIP OF THE ICEBERG.

10:18.070 --> 10:19.080
YOU MIGHT'VE SEEN THIS VIDEO OF

10:19.100 --> 10:22.139
TWO DOCTORS MAKING A

10:22.159 --> 10:24.070
NOW-DEBUNKED CLAIM THAT COVID

10:24.090 --> 10:25.149
DEATH RATES WERE EXAGGERATED,

10:25.169 --> 10:26.149
BECAUSE IT WAS ALL OVER FACEBOOK

10:26.169 --> 10:27.039
A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO.

10:27.059 --> 10:27.259
OR MAYBE YOU CAME ACROSS

10:27.279 --> 10:28.159
"PLANDEMIC," A

10:28.179 --> 10:29.059
PSEUDO-DOCUMENTARY FILLED WITH A

10:29.080 --> 10:30.009
HODGEPODGE OF CONSPIRACY

10:30.029 --> 10:31.120
THEORIES.

10:31.139 --> 10:32.269
IN JUST ONE WEEK, IT WAS VIEWED

10:32.289 --> 10:34.139
OVER 8 MILLION TIMES, WHICH IS A

10:34.159 --> 10:36.190
SHOCKINGLY HIGH NUMBER.

10:36.210 --> 10:38.080
THAT MEANS IT'S BEEN SEEN MORE

10:38.100 --> 10:40.000
TIMES THAN THIS TIKTOK OF A CAT

10:40.019 --> 10:41.039
MATCHING A PIANO'S PITCH:

[SCALE PLAYING]

10:44.250 --> 10:46.110

10:46.129 --> 10:47.259

10:47.279 --> 10:50.179
YOU DESERVE MORE VIEWS.

10:50.200 --> 10:51.259
AND THE PROBLEM IS, SOME ONLINE

10:51.279 --> 10:53.120
THEORIES HAVE ALREADY PROMPTED

10:53.139 --> 10:54.059
SOME WORRYING REAL-WORLD

10:54.080 --> 10:55.059
ACTIONS.

10:55.080 --> 10:56.149
TAKE THE HASHTAG

10:56.169 --> 10:57.169
#FilmYourHospital, WHICH SPREAD

10:57.190 --> 10:59.070
AFTER SOME CLAIMED THE SEVERITY

10:59.090 --> 11:00.129
OF THE PANDEMIC WAS BEING

11:00.149 --> 11:01.289
EXAGGERATED AND URGED PEOPLE TO

11:02.009 --> 11:04.100
EXPOSE THE TRUTH.

11:04.120 --> 11:06.029
THAT, UNFORTUNATELY, LED TO

11:06.049 --> 11:06.230
VIDEOS LIKE THIS ONE, WHERE A

11:06.250 --> 11:08.029
MAN ANGRILY DEMANDS HOSPITAL

11:08.049 --> 11:09.149
STAFF SHOW HIM THEIR CORONAVIRUS

11:09.169 --> 11:10.240
PATIENTS AND THEN SHOUTS AT THEM

11:10.259 --> 11:13.090
AS HE DRIVES AWAY.

11:13.110 --> 11:13.269
>> MAYBE YOU COULD CALL THE

11:13.289 --> 11:15.080
GOVERNOR AND TELL HIM ABOUT THE

11:15.100 --> 11:16.070
HOAX.

11:16.090 --> 11:19.129
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?

11:19.149 --> 11:21.049
>> YEAH, IT'S A HOAX.

11:21.070 --> 11:22.159
WHERE'S ALL THE PATIENTS?

11:22.179 --> 11:24.000
WHERE'S THE LINES OF SICK

11:24.019 --> 11:25.110
PEOPLE?

11:25.129 --> 11:27.100
>> THEY DON'T SIT IN OUR LOBBY.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.070
>> John: YEAH, SHE'S RIGHT.

11:29.090 --> 11:30.120
AND CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW CONFUSED

11:30.139 --> 11:32.000
THAT MAN IS WHEN HE TRIES TO

11:32.019 --> 11:33.049
CHECK INTO A HOTEL?

11:33.070 --> 11:34.210
"NO VACANCY?

11:34.230 --> 11:36.120
WHERE ARE ALL THE GUESTS?

11:36.139 --> 11:37.139
WHERE ARE THE DEPRESSED SALESMEN

11:37.159 --> 11:38.269
ATTEMPTING AUTOEROTIC

11:38.289 --> 11:43.029
ASPHYXIATION IN YOUR LOBBY?

11:43.049 --> 11:43.259
MAYBE YOU SHOULD CALL THE

11:43.279 --> 11:44.220
GOVERNOR OF THIS BEST WESTERN

11:44.240 --> 11:45.129
AND TELL HIM YOUR SIGN IS A

11:45.149 --> 11:46.049
HOAX."

11:46.070 --> 11:47.000
AND THE HARMS OF CONSPIRACY

11:47.019 --> 11:48.090
THEORIES DURING A PANDEMIC GO

11:48.110 --> 11:49.110
FAR BEYOND CONFUSED HOSPITAL

11:49.129 --> 11:51.110
WORKERS.

11:51.129 --> 11:52.269
AS ONE STUDY POINTED OUT, "GIVEN

11:52.289 --> 11:53.230
THE TRANSMISSIBILITY OF

11:53.250 --> 11:54.259
COVID-19, THESE BELIEFS ARE

11:54.279 --> 11:56.000
DANGEROUS EVEN IF ONLY A

11:56.019 --> 11:58.049
FRACTION OF AMERICANS SUCCUMBING

11:58.070 --> 11:59.200
TO THEM IGNORE BEST PRACTICES,

11:59.220 --> 12:01.200
SUCH AS SOCIAL DISTANCING."

12:01.220 --> 12:02.240
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TALK ABOUT

12:02.259 --> 12:04.129
CONSPIRACY THEORIES --

12:04.149 --> 12:05.200
PARTICULARLY, WHY THEY'RE SO

12:05.220 --> 12:06.289
APPEALING, HOW TO SPOT THEM, AND

12:07.009 --> 12:08.059
WHAT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO

12:08.080 --> 12:09.059
ABOUT IT.

12:09.080 --> 12:10.120
AND LET'S START WITH THE FACT

12:10.139 --> 12:11.139
THAT THESE THEORIES ARE A LOT

12:11.159 --> 12:12.100
MORE POPULAR THAN YOU MIGHT

12:12.120 --> 12:13.210
THINK.

12:13.230 --> 12:17.019
POLLS OVER THE YEARS HAVE SHOWN

12:17.039 --> 12:18.049
THAT OVER HALF OF AMERICANS

12:18.070 --> 12:19.029
CONSISTENTLY ENDORSE AT LEAST

12:19.049 --> 12:20.000
ONE SORT OF CONSPIRATORIAL

12:20.019 --> 12:22.240
NARRATIVE.

12:22.259 --> 12:24.019
AND, LOOK, I'M NOT IMMUNE HERE.

12:24.039 --> 12:24.250
EMBARRASSINGLY, THERE'S A PART

12:24.269 --> 12:25.210
OF ME THAT THINKS THE ROYAL

12:25.230 --> 12:26.090
FAMILY HAD PRINCESS DIANA

12:26.110 --> 12:31.090
KILLED.

12:31.110 --> 12:32.000
I KNOW THAT THEY DIDN'T,

12:32.019 --> 12:32.179
BECAUSE THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO

12:32.200 --> 12:34.220
EVIDENCE THAT THEY DID.

12:34.240 --> 12:35.230
BUT THE IDEA LINGERS,

12:35.250 --> 12:36.129
BECAUSE IT FELT TOO BIG AN EVENT

12:36.149 --> 12:36.250
TO BE ACCIDENTAL.

12:36.269 --> 12:37.259
THERE HAD TO BE SOME INTENT

12:37.279 --> 12:39.179
THERE.

12:39.200 --> 12:41.129
AND EXPERTS WILL SAY THAT THAT'S

12:41.149 --> 12:43.009
ACTUALLY A HUGE DRAW OF

12:43.029 --> 12:45.070
CONSPIRACY THEORIES -- THEY HELP

12:45.090 --> 12:46.279
EXPLAIN A CHAOTIC, UNCERTAIN

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
WORLD AND APPEAL TO THE HUMAN

12:49.019 --> 12:50.129
IMPULSE TO WHAT'S CALLED

12:50.149 --> 12:51.190
"PROPORTIONALITY BIAS," WHICH IS

12:51.210 --> 12:53.159
THE TENDENCY TO ASSUME THAT BIG

12:53.179 --> 12:55.029
EVENTS MUST HAVE BIG CAUSES.

12:55.049 --> 12:56.169
TAKE THE JFK ASSASSINATION.

12:56.190 --> 12:58.039
THAT EVENT SHOOK THE WORLD, AND

12:58.059 --> 13:00.289
THE IDEA THAT A LONE GUNMAN

13:01.009 --> 13:04.049
COULD CAUSE SUCH CHAOS WAS

13:04.070 --> 13:05.080
INHERENTLY UNSATISFYING, SO

13:05.100 --> 13:06.200
PEOPLE, PERHAPS UNDERSTANDABLY,

13:06.220 --> 13:07.179
REACHED FOR A MUCH BIGGER

13:07.200 --> 13:10.289
ANSWER.

13:11.009 --> 13:11.240
ALTHOUGH IT IS REVEALING THAT,

13:11.259 --> 13:12.210
CONVERSELY, LESS IMPACTFUL

13:12.230 --> 13:13.129
EVENTS HAVE ATTRACTED

13:13.149 --> 13:14.210
SIGNIFICANTLY LESS SPECULATION.

13:14.230 --> 13:16.059
>> THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION

13:16.080 --> 13:17.279
OF RONALD REAGAN WAS A SIMILAR

13:18.000 --> 13:18.240
EVENT IN ALL REGARDS, EXCEPT

13:18.259 --> 13:20.259
THAT THE PRESIDENT SURVIVED.

13:20.279 --> 13:22.230
IT WAS A SMALLER EVENT IN TERMS

13:22.250 --> 13:25.029
OF ITS OUTCOME, AND THEREFORE,

13:25.049 --> 13:26.120
WE'RE SATISFIED WITH SMALLER

13:26.139 --> 13:28.179
EXPLANATIONS.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.000
AND SO THERE HAVE BEEN ALMOST NO

13:30.019 --> 13:31.080
CONSPIRACY THEORIES ABOUT THE

13:31.100 --> 13:31.289
ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF

13:32.009 --> 13:33.129
RONALD REAGAN EITHER AT THE TIME

13:33.149 --> 13:34.289
OR SUBSEQUENTLY.

13:35.009 --> 13:41.259
>> John: EXACTLY.

13:41.279 --> 13:44.029
AND THAT KIND OF MAKES SENSE,

13:44.049 --> 13:44.210
DOESN'T IT?

13:44.230 --> 13:45.120
ONE MAN SUDDENLY CHANGING THE

13:45.139 --> 13:46.009
WORLD IS INCONCEIVABLE.

13:46.029 --> 13:46.200
ONE MAN FAILING MISERABLY ISN'T

13:46.220 --> 13:47.129
REMOTELY SURPRISING.

13:47.149 --> 13:48.149
SOMETHING WHICH IS,

13:48.169 --> 13:49.029
INCIDENTALLY, THE TAGLINE FOR

13:49.049 --> 13:52.190
FEMINISM.

13:52.210 --> 13:56.059
SO THESE THEORIES HAVE

13:56.080 --> 13:58.029
UNDENIABLE APPEAL AND THEY'VE

13:58.049 --> 13:58.240
BEEN PARTICULARLY SEDUCTIVE

13:58.259 --> 14:01.039
DURING GLOBAL HEALTH CRISES.

14:01.059 --> 14:02.000
IN THE 14TH CENTURY, CONSPIRACY

14:02.019 --> 14:02.250
THEORISTS CLAIMED THAT JEWISH

14:02.269 --> 14:03.139
PEOPLE WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

14:03.159 --> 14:04.110
BUBONIC PLAGUE; IN 1890, A

14:04.129 --> 14:05.110
NEWSPAPER CLAIMED THE ELECTRIC

14:05.129 --> 14:06.070
LIGHT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR A

14:06.090 --> 14:07.190
GLOBAL INFLUENZA OUTBREAK; AND

14:07.210 --> 14:09.120
IN 1918, RUMORS SPREAD THAT THE

14:09.139 --> 14:10.210
GERMAN PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY

14:10.230 --> 14:12.019
BAYER HAD TAINTED ITS U.S.-SOLD

14:12.039 --> 14:13.100
ASPIRIN TABLETS WITH THE

14:13.120 --> 14:15.279
SO-CALLED SPANISH FLU.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.100
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE NOW IS THAT

14:17.120 --> 14:18.250
OUR CURRENT PANDEMIC IS COMING

14:18.269 --> 14:20.059
IN THE AGE OF THE INTERNET, WHEN

14:20.080 --> 14:22.029
IT'S NOT ONLY EASIER FOR PEOPLE

14:22.049 --> 14:23.000
TO DO BAD RESEARCH AND SPREAD

14:23.019 --> 14:24.230
THEIR RESULTS, IT'S ALSO

14:24.250 --> 14:26.049
POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO MAKE

14:26.070 --> 14:27.149
MATERIAL LOOK STARTLINGLY

14:27.169 --> 14:28.250
AUTHORITATIVE.

14:28.269 --> 14:30.139
IN FACT, TAKE "PLANDEMIC."

14:30.159 --> 14:31.230
AT FIRST VIEW, IT LOOKS LIKE A

14:31.250 --> 14:33.149
HIGH-BUDGET TRUE-CRIME

14:33.169 --> 14:34.259
DOCUMENTARY WITH FANCY GRAPHICS

14:34.279 --> 14:37.139
AND DRONE FOOTAGE, AND IT

14:37.159 --> 14:39.049
DEPLOYS THOSE TECHNIQUES TO TELL

14:39.070 --> 14:40.240
THE STORY OF JUDY MIKOVITS, A

14:40.259 --> 14:41.190
FORMER SCIENTIST AT THE NATIONAL

14:41.210 --> 14:42.259
CANCER INSTITUTE, WHO IS

14:42.279 --> 14:44.049
DEPICTED AS A WHISTLEBLOWER ON

14:44.070 --> 14:45.269
THE SCIENTIFIC ESTABLISHMENT.

14:45.289 --> 14:46.200
HERE IS HOW THE FILM PRESENTS A

14:46.220 --> 14:47.259
KEY MOMENT IN MIKOVITS'

14:47.279 --> 14:49.250
NARRATIVE, WHERE SHE CLAIMS HER

14:49.269 --> 14:51.149
ENEMIES HAD HER ARRESTED WITHOUT

14:51.169 --> 14:52.210
CAUSE.

14:52.230 --> 14:53.230
>> AND SO WHAT DID THEY CHARGE

14:53.250 --> 14:54.039
YOU WITH?

14:54.059 --> 14:55.139
>> NOTHING.

14:55.159 --> 14:56.279
>> BUT YOU WERE IN JAIL?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.049
>> I WAS HELD IN JAIL WITH NO

14:58.070 --> 14:58.269
CHARGES.

14:58.289 --> 15:00.129
I WAS CALLED A FUGITIVE FROM

15:00.149 --> 15:05.129
JUSTICE.

15:05.149 --> 15:06.279
NO WARRANT.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.259
LITERALLY DRUG ME OUT OF THE

15:08.279 --> 15:10.179
HOUSE.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.220
OUR NEIGHBORS ARE LOOKING AT

15:11.240 --> 15:12.129
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

15:12.149 --> 15:13.190
YOU KNOW, THEY SEARCH MY HOUSE

15:13.210 --> 15:15.179
WITHOUT A WARRANT.

15:15.200 --> 15:18.259
>> John: NOW THAT LOOKS PRETTY

15:18.279 --> 15:19.149
COMPELLING THERE.

15:19.169 --> 15:20.210
THE POLICE SURROUNDING HER

15:20.230 --> 15:21.100
HOUSE, USING VIOLENT FORCE, AND

15:21.120 --> 15:22.210
EVENTUALLY THROWING HER IN JAIL

15:22.230 --> 15:23.190
WITHOUT CAUSE.

15:23.210 --> 15:24.059
BUT A FEW THINGS YOU SHOULD

15:24.080 --> 15:25.179
KNOW: FIRST, SHE WAS ABSOLUTELY

15:25.200 --> 15:27.250
CRIMINALLY CHARGED.

15:27.269 --> 15:29.009
AS STATED IN A LAWSUIT SHE

15:29.029 --> 15:31.110
HERSELF LATER FILED OVER THE

15:31.129 --> 15:33.090
ARREST, "MIKOVITS WAS ARRESTED

15:33.110 --> 15:33.269
ON CRIMINAL CHARGES."

15:33.289 --> 15:35.139
AND WHEN A REPORTER POINTED THIS

15:35.159 --> 15:36.259
OUT TO HER, SHE SAID SHE MEANT

15:36.279 --> 15:38.019
THE CHARGES WERE LATER DROPPED,

15:38.039 --> 15:40.000
ADDING, "I'VE BEEN CONFUSED FOR

15:40.019 --> 15:40.250
A DECADE," AND THAT "I'LL TRY TO

15:40.269 --> 15:42.019
LEARN TO SAY IT DIFFERENTLY."

15:42.039 --> 15:44.059
SECOND, WHILE THAT ARREST

15:44.080 --> 15:45.210
FOOTAGE LOOKS DRAMATIC, IT'S NOT

15:45.230 --> 15:47.190
ACTUALLY FROM HER ARREST AT ALL.

15:47.210 --> 15:49.190
IT'S FROM "AN UNRELATED SWAT

15:49.210 --> 15:51.120
RAID" AND IS LITERALLY THE FIRST

15:51.139 --> 15:53.039
RESULT YOU GET WHEN YOU SEARCH

15:53.059 --> 15:54.080
"HOUSE RAID" ON A STOCK FOOTAGE

15:54.100 --> 15:58.149
WEBSITE.

15:58.169 --> 16:01.169
WHICH IS JUST RIDICULOUS,

16:01.190 --> 16:03.070
BECAUSE THEY'D SIMPLY WORKED A

16:03.090 --> 16:04.269
LITTLE HARDER AND SEARCHED

16:04.289 --> 16:06.269
"HOUSE RAID" ON OTHER STOCK

16:06.289 --> 16:08.059
FOOTAGE SITES, THEY COULD HAVE

16:08.080 --> 16:09.179
FOUND THIS VIDEO OF A MASKED

16:09.200 --> 16:10.289
ROBBER SPANKING HIMSELF, THEN

16:11.009 --> 16:11.240
FLIPPING THE BIRD,

16:11.259 --> 16:12.110
AND DANCING AROUND LIKE A

16:12.129 --> 16:13.000
MANIAC.

16:13.019 --> 16:13.279
AND THAT'S NOT JUST OBJECTIVELY

16:14.000 --> 16:14.169
BETTER THAN THE CLIP THEY CHOSE,

16:14.190 --> 16:15.210
IT'S ALSO EXACTLY AS RELEVANT.

16:15.230 --> 16:16.129
AND THE ISSUE ISN'T JUST THAT

16:16.149 --> 16:18.159
THE FILM MISREPRESENTS

16:18.179 --> 16:19.190
MIKOVITS' BACKSTORY.

16:19.210 --> 16:20.269
IT'S THAT, IN DOING SO, THEY

16:20.289 --> 16:22.039
LEND HER AN AIR OF CREDIBILITY

16:22.059 --> 16:23.139
WHEN THEY ALLOW HER TO MAKE

16:23.159 --> 16:24.009
UNCHALLENGED BATSHIT MEDICAL

16:24.029 --> 16:27.080
CLAIMS LIKE THESE.

16:27.100 --> 16:29.110
>> WEARING THE MASK LITERALLY

16:29.129 --> 16:30.019
ACTIVATES YOUR OWN VIRUS.

16:30.039 --> 16:31.120
YOU'RE GETTING SICK FROM YOUR

16:31.139 --> 16:33.059
OWN REACTIVATED CORONAVIRUS

16:33.080 --> 16:35.120
EXPRESSIONS.

16:35.139 --> 16:37.210
AND IF IT HAPPENS TO BE

16:37.230 --> 16:38.230
SARS-COV-2, THEN YOU'VE GOT A

16:38.250 --> 16:40.139
BIG PROBLEM.

16:40.159 --> 16:42.009
WHY WOULD YOU CLOSE THE BEACH?

16:42.029 --> 16:43.179
YOU'VE GOT SEQUENCES IN THE

16:43.200 --> 16:45.250
SOIL, IN THE SAND.

16:45.269 --> 16:47.080
YOU'VE GOT HEALING MICROBES IN

16:47.100 --> 16:50.059
THE OCEAN, IN THE SALT WATER.

16:50.080 --> 16:53.090
THAT'S INSANITY.

16:53.110 --> 16:54.090
>> John: YES.

16:54.110 --> 16:55.090
IT IS.

16:55.110 --> 16:56.100
EVERYTHING YOU JUST SAID IS

16:56.120 --> 16:58.210
INSANE.

16:58.230 --> 16:59.269
THE IDEA THAT WEARING A MASK

16:59.289 --> 17:00.149
"ACTIVATES YOUR OWN VIRUS" IS

17:00.169 --> 17:01.169
ABSURD.

17:01.190 --> 17:03.000
IN DEBUNKING IT, POLITIFACT

17:03.019 --> 17:04.049
SAID, "THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO

17:04.069 --> 17:05.220
SUPPORT THIS," AND THEN THREW

17:05.240 --> 17:06.079
IN, "WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT A

17:06.098 --> 17:07.150
'CORONAVIRUS EXPRESSION'

17:07.170 --> 17:09.079
EVEN IS."

17:09.098 --> 17:10.140
AS FOR THE IDEA THAT THERE ARE

17:10.160 --> 17:11.150
HEALING MICROBES AT THE BEACH,

17:11.170 --> 17:12.259
LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO BE THE

17:12.279 --> 17:13.230
DEPRESSING GUY THAT TELLS YOU

17:13.250 --> 17:15.069
GOING TO THE BEACH WON'T CURE

17:15.089 --> 17:16.130
CORONAVIRUS.

17:16.150 --> 17:17.269
I WILL SAY, THE BEACH IS EXACTLY

17:17.289 --> 17:19.130
THREE THINGS, NONE OF WHICH ARE

17:19.150 --> 17:21.029
MEDICINE: IT'S SAND THAT GOES

17:21.049 --> 17:22.130
DOWN YOUR ASS-CRACK, SALT WATER

17:22.150 --> 17:23.200
THAT GETS UP YOUR NOSE, AND SUN

17:23.220 --> 17:24.289
THAT BURNS YOUR SKIN.

17:25.009 --> 17:25.289
THE BEACH DOESN'T CURE ANYTHING

17:26.009 --> 17:28.240
EXCEPT YOU BEING COMFORTABLE.

17:28.259 --> 17:30.009
AND INCIDENTALLY, WHEN WE

17:30.029 --> 17:30.220
REACHED OUT TO THE DIRECTOR OF

17:30.240 --> 17:31.250
"PLANDEMIC" TO CITE OUR MANY

17:31.269 --> 17:33.150
ISSUES WITH THE FILM, HE WROTE

17:33.170 --> 17:35.160
BACK, NOT ONLY SAYING HE STANDS

17:35.180 --> 17:36.210
BEHIND IT, BUT ASKING, "IN A

17:36.230 --> 17:38.079
COUNTRY THAT MARCHES TO THE

17:38.099 --> 17:40.089
CHANT OF 'BELIEVE ALL WOMEN,'

17:40.109 --> 17:40.289
WHY IS IT THAT PEOPLE ARE SO

17:41.009 --> 17:41.279
QUICK TO DISBELIEVE

17:42.000 --> 17:43.079
DR. MIKOVITS?"

17:43.099 --> 17:44.170
TO WHICH THE ANSWER IS,

17:44.190 --> 17:46.029
OBVIOUSLY, A, BECAUSE SHE'S

17:46.049 --> 17:46.279
TELLING PEOPLE GOOD CORONAVIRUS

17:47.000 --> 17:49.009
PREVENTION INVOLVES NOT WEARING

17:49.029 --> 17:49.279
A MASK AND GOING BOOGIE

17:50.000 --> 17:51.250
BOARDING; B, THE PHRASE IS

17:51.269 --> 17:53.250
"BELIEVE WOMEN," NOT

17:53.269 --> 17:54.240
"BELIEVE ALL WOMEN"; AND C,

17:54.259 --> 17:56.059
THAT'S NOT WHAT THAT PHRASE IS

17:56.079 --> 17:57.049
ABOUT.

17:57.069 --> 17:58.079
BECAUSE THE POINT OF THE

17:58.099 --> 17:59.170
MOVEMENT IS NOT, "WELL,

17:59.190 --> 18:00.170
I GUESS WE ALL HAVE TO TAKE

18:00.190 --> 18:01.180
RACHEL DOLEZAL AT HER FUCKING

18:01.200 --> 18:06.109
WORD NOW."

18:06.130 --> 18:07.269
AND, LOOK, I AM WELL AWARE THAT,

18:07.289 --> 18:09.160
FOR SOME, EVEN THESE CRITICISMS

18:09.180 --> 18:10.039
OF "PLANDEMIC" WILL SOMEHOW BE

18:10.059 --> 18:10.220
FURTHER PROOF THAT WHAT IT'S

18:10.240 --> 18:12.180
SAYING TRUE.

18:12.200 --> 18:13.289
THAT'S ACTUALLY A COMMON TRAIT

18:14.009 --> 18:15.000
OF CONSPIRACY THEORIES -- THAT

18:15.019 --> 18:16.099
THEY'RE "INHERENTLY

18:16.119 --> 18:17.049
SELF-SEALING," WITH ANY

18:17.069 --> 18:18.160
CRITICISM JUST BECOMING EVIDENCE

18:18.180 --> 18:19.220
THAT THE WHOLE THING IS BIGGER

18:19.240 --> 18:23.180
THAN ANYONE COULD'VE IMAGINED.

18:23.200 --> 18:24.259
ALTHOUGH I WILL SIMPLY SAY THIS:

18:24.279 --> 18:25.200
IF I AM IN ON THIS CONSPIRACY,

18:25.220 --> 18:27.039
THAT MEANS MY PUPPET MASTER IS

18:27.059 --> 18:28.180
AT&T.

18:28.200 --> 18:29.289
AND WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THEY

18:30.009 --> 18:31.089
CAN PULL OFF A GLOBAL CONSPIRACY

18:31.109 --> 18:32.079
WHEN THEY CAN BARELY PULL OFF A

18:32.099 --> 18:33.259
COMPLETE PHONE CALL?

18:33.279 --> 18:34.200
HOW WOULD THEY EVEN BE SENDING

18:34.220 --> 18:35.269
ME ORDERS?

18:35.289 --> 18:38.029
SPRINT?

18:38.049 --> 18:39.089
THE POINT IS, THESE THEORIES CAN

18:39.109 --> 18:41.000
BE INNATELY APPEALING, AND

18:41.019 --> 18:42.029
THANKS TO THE INTERNET, CAN

18:42.049 --> 18:43.150
SPREAD WITH EASE.

18:43.170 --> 18:45.039
AND ALL OF THIS WOULD BE

18:45.059 --> 18:46.069
DANGEROUS ENOUGH BEFORE YOU TAKE

18:46.089 --> 18:47.200
INTO ACCOUNT THAT ONE OF THE

18:47.220 --> 18:49.089
MOST PROMINENT SPREADERS OF

18:49.109 --> 18:50.130
CONSPIRACIES ON EARTH IS THE

18:50.150 --> 18:52.099
CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE

18:52.119 --> 18:53.259
UNITED STATES, BECAUSE HE'S BEEN

18:53.279 --> 18:54.200
SPREADING THEM AROUND FOR YEARS,

18:54.220 --> 18:56.000
OFTEN WITH THE EXCUSE THAT

18:56.019 --> 18:57.259
"PEOPLE ARE SAYING" THEM, AND

18:57.279 --> 18:58.190
HE'S "JUST ASKING QUESTIONS" --

18:58.210 --> 18:59.289
SOMETHING HE'S DONE ON BULLSHIT

19:00.009 --> 19:01.049
CLAIMS LIKE "OBAMA WAS BORN IN

19:01.069 --> 19:02.230
KENYA," "ANTONIN SCALIA WAS

19:02.250 --> 19:04.039
MURDERED," AND THAT MILLIONS OF

19:04.059 --> 19:05.049
FAKE VOTES WERE CAST FOR

19:05.069 --> 19:06.289
HILLARY CLINTON.

19:07.009 --> 19:08.130
CONSPIRACIES ARE SORT OF LIKE

19:08.150 --> 19:10.130
UGLY BUILDINGS AND DEEPLY TRAGIC

19:10.150 --> 19:11.269
ADULT CHILDREN IN THAT

19:11.289 --> 19:13.089
DONALD TRUMP LOVES TO UNLEASH

19:13.109 --> 19:14.150
THEM INTO THE WORLD AND THEN

19:14.170 --> 19:16.019
REFUSE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

19:16.039 --> 19:16.240
FOR THEM EVER AGAIN.

19:16.259 --> 19:17.250
AND HE'S BEEN DOING THIS

19:17.269 --> 19:19.140
THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC,

19:19.160 --> 19:20.190
INCLUDING JUST THIS WEEK, WHEN

19:20.210 --> 19:23.140
HE RETWEETED A THEORY THAT THE

19:23.160 --> 19:24.230
CDC AND THE MEDIA ARE LYING

19:24.250 --> 19:25.130
ABOUT THE VIRUS TO HURT HIS

19:25.150 --> 19:26.170
RE-ELECTION CHANCES.

19:26.190 --> 19:28.160
TRUMP HAS PASSED ON SO MANY

19:28.180 --> 19:29.279
CONSPIRACIES THAT NEWS OUTLETS

19:30.000 --> 19:31.130
HAVE REPEATEDLY CALLED HIM THE

19:31.150 --> 19:35.230
"CONSPIRACY THEORIST IN CHIEF."

19:35.250 --> 19:36.130
ALTHOUGH I WOULD ARGUE HE'S NOT

19:36.150 --> 19:37.160
INVESTED IN ANY OF THE THINGS

19:37.180 --> 19:38.019
HE'S SPREADING; HE'S ONLY

19:38.039 --> 19:38.269
INTERESTED IN AMPLIFYING

19:38.289 --> 19:40.230
WHATEVER HE THINKS MIGHT BENEFIT

19:40.250 --> 19:43.079
HIM.

19:43.099 --> 19:44.069
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING

19:44.089 --> 19:46.019
THIS, BUT THE PERSON WITH THE

19:46.039 --> 19:47.180
CLEAREST SENSE OF JUST HOW

19:47.200 --> 19:49.000
DEEPLY CYNICAL TRUMP'S USE OF

19:49.019 --> 19:49.250
CONSPIRACY THEORIES IS IS THIS

19:49.269 --> 19:51.140
GUY:

19:51.160 --> 19:52.160
>> WHEN YOU GET TO TRUMP AND HIS

19:52.180 --> 19:54.029
CONSPIRACY THEORIES, HE DOES IT

19:54.049 --> 19:57.230
IN A REALLY CLEVER WAY.

19:57.250 --> 20:00.279
TRUMP NEVER SAYS THAT HE

20:01.000 --> 20:01.269
BELIEVES THESE CONSPIRACY

20:02.000 --> 20:07.079
THEORIES THAT HE TOUTS.

20:07.099 --> 20:09.170
HE'S SIMPLY PASSING THEM ON.

20:09.190 --> 20:11.170
AND IT -- IT'S HIS WAY OF

20:11.190 --> 20:13.150
JAMMING THEM UP, IT'S HIS WAY OF

20:13.170 --> 20:14.150
TEASING 'EM, IT'S HIS WAY OF

20:14.170 --> 20:16.059
GETTING THESE CONSPIRACY

20:16.079 --> 20:19.160
THEORIES OUT THERE.

20:19.180 --> 20:21.180
SO, TRUMP IS JUST THROWING

20:21.200 --> 20:23.009
GASOLINE ON A FIRE HERE AND HE'S

20:23.029 --> 20:25.150
HAVING FUN WATCHING THE FLAMES.

20:25.170 --> 20:27.119
>> John: YEAH, RUSH LIMBAUGH

20:27.140 --> 20:29.210
GETS IT -- A SENTENCE I NEVER

20:29.230 --> 20:30.119
THOUGHT I'D SAY UNLESS I WAS

20:30.140 --> 20:31.059
TALKING ABOUT TOILET-TRANSMITTED

20:31.079 --> 20:33.019
CHLAMYDIA.

20:33.039 --> 20:34.140
BUT THE THING IS, RIGHT NOW IN

20:34.160 --> 20:36.170
PARTICULAR, THERE'S REAL HARM IN

20:36.190 --> 20:38.269
THROWING GASOLINE ON THE FIRE,

20:38.289 --> 20:40.140
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET

20:40.160 --> 20:41.210
BURNED, MAKING THOSE FLAMES NOT

20:41.230 --> 20:43.200
QUITE AS FUCKING FUN TO WATCH.

20:43.220 --> 20:46.029
BECAUSE MAKE NO MISTAKE --

20:46.049 --> 20:47.190
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CONVINCED

20:47.210 --> 20:48.170
THAT COVID WAS OVERBLOWN HAVE

20:48.190 --> 20:50.150
SOMETIMES PAID A STEEP PRICE.

20:50.170 --> 20:53.259
>> AROUND THIS TIME LAST MONTH,

20:53.279 --> 20:54.289
JUPITER RIDESHARE DRIVER

20:55.009 --> 20:56.150
BRIAN HITCHENS WAS A

20:56.170 --> 20:57.069
SELF-PROCLAIMED COVID-19

20:57.089 --> 20:58.049
SKEPTIC.

20:58.069 --> 20:59.269
>> I THOUGHT IT WAS MAYBE THE

20:59.289 --> 21:03.069
GOVERNMENT WAS TRYING SOMETHING

21:03.089 --> 21:04.140
THAT -- AND IT WAS KIND OF LIKE

21:04.160 --> 21:06.049
A -- KIND OF LIKE THEY THREW IT

21:06.069 --> 21:07.230
OUT THERE TO KIND OF DISTRACT

21:07.250 --> 21:09.039
US.

21:09.059 --> 21:10.160
>> FAST FORWARD TO THIS WEEK AND

21:10.180 --> 21:16.000
HITCHENS HAS A WHOLE NEW OUTLOOK

21:16.019 --> 21:17.140
>> THIS IS A REAL VIRUS THAT

21:17.160 --> 21:18.240
YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE SERIOUS.

21:18.259 --> 21:19.250
MY WIFE'S ON THE VENTILATOR.

21:19.269 --> 21:21.079
SHE'S BEEN LIKE THAT FOR THREE

21:21.099 --> 21:26.009
WEEKS.

21:26.029 --> 21:27.039
AND IT'S TOUGH, IT'S --

21:27.059 --> 21:27.140
IT'S SAD.

21:27.160 --> 21:33.250
>> John: YEAH, IT IS SAD.

21:33.269 --> 21:35.119
AND UNFORTUNATELY, I

21:35.140 --> 21:36.089
DON'T THINK HE'S GOING TO BE THE

21:36.109 --> 21:37.079
LAST PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY TO

21:37.099 --> 21:37.259
LEARN THAT A LOT OF WHAT'S ON

21:37.279 --> 21:38.130
THE INTERNET IS BULLSHIT THE

21:38.150 --> 21:39.099
HARD WAY.

21:39.119 --> 21:40.009
SO WHAT CAN WE DO HERE?

21:40.029 --> 21:41.019
SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES ARE

21:41.039 --> 21:41.220
FINALLY DOING MORE TO LABEL

21:41.240 --> 21:42.130
CONSPIRACY THEORIES OR LIMIT

21:42.150 --> 21:43.160
THEIR SPREAD, BUT THE TRUTH IS,

21:43.180 --> 21:47.119
THEY CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH.

21:47.140 --> 21:48.279
THEY DON'T ALWAYS HAVE THE

21:49.000 --> 21:50.039
EXPERTISE TO LITIGATE WHAT IS

21:50.059 --> 21:50.220
AND ISN'T TRUE.

21:50.240 --> 21:51.269
AND THE SHEER VOLUME OF MATERIAL

21:51.289 --> 21:54.069
FLYING AROUND MAKES IT

21:54.089 --> 21:55.009
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO CATCH

21:55.029 --> 21:55.099
EVERYTHING.

21:55.119 --> 21:56.019
AND THAT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR

21:56.039 --> 21:57.210
US IN THIS STORY TOO.

21:57.230 --> 21:59.269
WE'RE CLEARLY ONLY SCRATCHING

21:59.289 --> 22:01.269
THE SURFACE OF WHAT'S OUT THERE,

22:01.289 --> 22:02.170
AND I'M SURE IF YOU LOOK DOWN AT

22:02.190 --> 22:03.250
THE COMMENTS SECTION WHEN THIS

22:03.269 --> 22:05.140
IS ON YOUTUBE, YOU'LL FIND

22:05.160 --> 22:06.039
PEOPLE SAYING, "HOW ABOUT THE

22:06.059 --> 22:07.000
FACT THE VIRUS WAS CREATED AS A

22:07.019 --> 22:07.220
BIOWEAPON?"

22:07.240 --> 22:08.250
OR "WHAT ABOUT BILL GATES' PLAN

22:08.269 --> 22:10.180
TO MICROCHIP ME?"

22:10.200 --> 22:12.279
AND IT WOULD TAKE DAYS TO GO

22:13.000 --> 22:14.089
THROUGH WHY EACH ONE IS

22:14.109 --> 22:15.079
BULLSHIT, AND IT STILL WON'T

22:15.099 --> 22:16.059
ADDRESS THE ONES THAT COME UP IN

22:16.079 --> 22:18.119
THE WEEKS AND MONTHS AHEAD.

22:18.140 --> 22:21.019
THE FACT IS, IT'S GOING TO BE

22:21.039 --> 22:21.289
INCUMBENT ON US AS INDIVIDUALS

22:22.009 --> 22:23.029
TO TRY AND SPOT THESE THEORIES

22:23.049 --> 22:24.289
AND TREAT THEM WITH A SKEPTICAL

22:25.009 --> 22:25.259
EYE BEFORE WE BELIEVE THEM OR,

22:25.279 --> 22:28.119
INDEED, SPREAD THEM AROUND.

22:28.140 --> 22:30.000
AND THERE ARE ACTUALLY THREE

22:30.019 --> 22:30.230
BASIC QUESTIONS YOU CAN ASK

22:30.250 --> 22:31.240
YOURSELF THAT COULD HELP IN THAT

22:31.259 --> 22:33.059
REGARD.

22:33.079 --> 22:34.180
FIRST, IS THERE A RATIONAL,

22:34.200 --> 22:38.130
NON-CONSPIRACY EXPLANATION?

22:38.150 --> 22:40.079
'CAUSE REMEMBER THE THEORY 5G

22:40.099 --> 22:40.210
TOWERS ARE SPREADING

22:40.230 --> 22:41.069
CORONAVIRUS?

22:41.089 --> 22:43.160
OR, AS THAT ONE WOMAN SO

22:43.180 --> 22:44.079
MEMORABLY PHRASED IT...

22:44.099 --> 22:45.019
>> WHEN THEY TURN THAT SWITCH

22:45.039 --> 22:45.259
ON, BYE-BYE, MAMA.

22:45.279 --> 22:47.009
>> John: EXACTLY.

22:47.029 --> 22:48.130
IT MADE THE ROUNDS, HELPED BY

22:48.150 --> 22:49.190
IMAGES LIKE THESE, SHOWING MAPS

22:49.210 --> 22:50.220
OF CORONAVIRUS CASES ALONGSIDE

22:50.240 --> 22:53.039
MAPS OF THE 5G ROLLOUT.

22:53.059 --> 22:57.069
AND INITIALLY THE SIMILARITY

22:57.089 --> 22:59.039
THERE DOES SEEM STRIKING, UNTIL

22:59.059 --> 22:59.230
YOU REALIZE THOSE MAPS ALSO LOOK

22:59.250 --> 23:01.130
LIKE ONES OF POPULATION DENSITY,

23:01.150 --> 23:02.099
WHICH MAKES A LOT MORE SENSE.

23:02.119 --> 23:04.039
BECAUSE THAT'S CORRELATION, NOT

23:04.059 --> 23:05.160
CAUSATION.

23:05.180 --> 23:07.049
WI-FI ROLLOUTS AND VIRUS CASES

23:07.069 --> 23:08.059
WILL BOTH BE WHERE THERE ARE A

23:08.079 --> 23:10.049
LOT OF PEOPLE.

23:10.069 --> 23:11.109
IN FACT, LOTS OF MAPS LOOK LIKE

23:11.130 --> 23:13.000
THOSE MAPS.

23:13.019 --> 23:14.119
THIS ONE OF DOMINO'S PIZZA

23:14.140 --> 23:15.240
LOCATIONS LOOKS LIKE A MAP OF

23:15.259 --> 23:16.279
CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAKS, AND I'M

23:17.000 --> 23:18.029
PRETTY SURE DOMINO'S PIZZA ISN'T

23:18.049 --> 23:19.230
CAUSING IT.

23:19.250 --> 23:21.079
YES, THEIR WISCONSIN 6 CHEESE

23:21.099 --> 23:23.210
WILL GIVE YOU A DRY COUGH,

23:23.230 --> 23:24.279
FEVER, DIARRHEA, AND COVID TOE,

23:25.000 --> 23:26.039
BUT NOT IN THE EXACT SAME WAY AS

23:26.059 --> 23:27.289
THE CORONAVIRUS, AND KNOWING THE

23:28.009 --> 23:31.109
DIFFERENCE IS CALLED "SCIENCE."

23:31.130 --> 23:32.279
NOW, THE SECOND QUESTION YOU

23:33.000 --> 23:34.079
COULD ASK IS, "HAS THIS BEEN

23:34.099 --> 23:35.009
HELD UP TO SCRUTINY BY EXPERTS?

23:35.029 --> 23:35.289
AND IF SO, WHAT DID THOSE

23:36.009 --> 23:37.240
EXPERTS SAY?"

23:37.259 --> 23:39.079
BECAUSE IT'S NOT UNCOMMON

23:39.099 --> 23:40.079
FOR THEORIES TO CITE A SINGLE

23:40.099 --> 23:42.140
SOURCE -- A DOCTOR OR SCIENTIST,

23:42.160 --> 23:44.009
LIKE SEVERELY MIDWESTERN

23:44.029 --> 23:45.190
DIANE KEATON HERE -- MAKING AN

23:45.210 --> 23:47.289
OUTLANDISH CLAIM.

23:48.009 --> 23:49.089
BUT IT'S WORTH CHECKING IF MOST

23:49.109 --> 23:50.019
CREDIBLE DOCTORS OR SCIENTISTS

23:50.039 --> 23:51.150
AGREE WITH THEM.

23:51.170 --> 23:57.019
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "WELL,

23:57.039 --> 23:57.230
WHAT IF ALL OF THEM ARE IN ON

23:57.250 --> 23:58.079
THE COVER-UP, TOO?"

23:58.099 --> 23:59.140
THAT ACTUALLY BRINGS US TO OUR

23:59.160 --> 24:00.039
FINAL QUESTION: HOW PLAUSIBLE IS

24:00.059 --> 24:01.019
THIS CONSPIRACY AS A PRACTICAL

24:01.039 --> 24:02.009
MATTER?"

24:02.029 --> 24:03.130
BECAUSE NOT EVERY CONSPIRACY

24:03.150 --> 24:09.170
THEORY IS FICTIONAL.

24:09.190 --> 24:10.230
OBVIOUSLY, SOME HAVE ABSOLUTELY

24:10.250 --> 24:11.140
TURNED OUT TO BE TRUE.

24:11.160 --> 24:12.079
BUT THE VERY FACT WE KNOW ABOUT

24:12.099 --> 24:13.019
THE REAL ONES ACTUALLY TEACHES

24:13.039 --> 24:13.230
US SOMETHING IMPORTANT.

24:13.250 --> 24:14.130
ONE STUDY LOOKED AT REAL

24:14.150 --> 24:15.240
GOVERNMENT SECRETS, LIKE

24:15.259 --> 24:17.099
THE U.S. EXPERIMENTING ON

24:17.119 --> 24:18.089
THE TUSKEGEE AIRMEN AND

24:18.109 --> 24:19.230
EDWARD SNOWDEN'S REVELATIONS

24:19.250 --> 24:20.269
ABOUT GOVERNMENT SURVEILLANCE,

24:20.289 --> 24:21.170
AND FOUND THE REASON THEY

24:21.190 --> 24:22.190
UNRAVELED WAS BECAUSE OF THE

24:22.210 --> 24:24.160
SHEER NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAD

24:24.180 --> 24:26.170
TO KEEP THEM SECRET.

24:26.190 --> 24:27.279
THEY ACTUALLY CREATED AN

24:28.000 --> 24:29.160
EQUATION TO PREDICT HOW QUICKLY

24:29.180 --> 24:30.259
OTHER SCIENCE-BASED CONSPIRACY

24:30.279 --> 24:32.079
THEORIES WOULD HAVE UNRAVELED

24:32.099 --> 24:33.279
HAD THEY BEEN TRUE, FINDING THAT

24:34.000 --> 24:35.200
FAKING THE MOON LANDING WOULD'VE

24:35.220 --> 24:37.269
REQUIRED AN ESTIMATED 411,000

24:37.289 --> 24:39.289
PEOPLE TO KEEP QUIET AND

24:40.009 --> 24:41.210
WOULD'VE BROKEN DOWN IN JUST

24:41.230 --> 24:44.039
OVER THREE AND A HALF YEARS.

24:44.059 --> 24:46.079
WHICH DOES MAKES SENSE, BECAUSE

24:46.099 --> 24:48.190
THINK FOR A SECOND JUST HOW MANY

24:48.210 --> 24:49.259
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO BE SWORN TO

24:49.279 --> 24:51.049
SECRECY TO KEEP A CORONAVIRUS

24:51.069 --> 24:52.130
HOAX UNDER WRAPS.

24:52.150 --> 24:57.059
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER

24:57.079 --> 24:58.170
TRIED TO ORGANIZE, SAY, A

24:58.190 --> 25:01.049
MID-SIZE SURPRISE PARTY FOR YOUR

25:01.069 --> 25:02.099
COUSIN, BUT IT'S BORDERLINE

25:02.119 --> 25:03.269
IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP IT QUIET,

25:03.289 --> 25:05.160
BECAUSE SOMEONE'S TELLING

25:05.180 --> 25:06.029
ROXANNE, NO MATTER HOW MANY

25:06.049 --> 25:07.069
TIMES YOU'VE

25:07.089 --> 25:07.259
EMAILED, "NO ONE TELL ROXANNE."

25:07.279 --> 25:10.059
ROXANNE IS FINDING OUT.

25:10.079 --> 25:11.210
AND I KNOW YOU MAY NOT FIND

25:11.230 --> 25:14.000
CONSPIRACY THEORIES PLAUSIBLE,

25:14.019 --> 25:14.279
BUT YOU ALSO MAY KNOW PEOPLE WHO

25:15.000 --> 25:16.099
DO.

25:16.119 --> 25:17.289
AND WHILE YOU CAN'T REACH

25:18.009 --> 25:19.230
EVERYONE, YOU CAN REACH SOME.

25:19.250 --> 25:21.190
AND NOW MORE THAN EVER, IT MIGHT

25:21.210 --> 25:24.200
BE IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO TRY.

25:24.220 --> 25:27.180
WHICH CLEARLY ISN'T EASY -- IT'S

25:27.200 --> 25:31.220
COMPLETELY NATURAL TO SIMPLY

25:31.240 --> 25:32.140
WANT TO SCREAM AT THEM, "WHY DO

25:32.160 --> 25:33.079
YOU BELIEVE THIS

25:33.099 --> 25:34.000
NONSENSE, YOU TITANIC IDIOT?"

25:34.019 --> 25:35.049
AND I'D SAY "JUST SHOW THEM THIS

25:35.069 --> 25:36.089
PIECE," BUT OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT

25:36.109 --> 25:37.210
THE BEST MESSENGER.

25:37.230 --> 25:38.259
WITHIN IN THE FIRST 20 SECONDS

25:38.279 --> 25:40.109
OF THIS STORY, I CALLED YOUR

25:40.130 --> 25:48.109
UNCLE A DIPSHIT.

25:48.130 --> 25:49.160
DIPSHITS TEND NOT TO LIKE THAT.

25:49.180 --> 25:50.029
WHAT EXPERTS SAY IS THAT THE

25:50.049 --> 25:51.140
MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO APPROACH

25:51.160 --> 25:52.029
SOMEONE IS NOT BY SHAMING THEM

25:52.049 --> 25:53.089
FOR BELIEVING SOMETHING OR

25:53.109 --> 25:54.009
OVERWHELMING THEM WITH COUNTER

25:54.029 --> 25:54.279
EVIDENCE, BUT TO TRY AND BE

25:55.000 --> 25:55.269
EMPATHETIC, MEET THEM WHERE THEY

25:55.289 --> 25:57.170
ARE, AND NUDGE THEM TO THINK A

25:57.190 --> 26:00.000
BIT MORE CRITICALLY.

26:00.019 --> 26:02.049
SO TO THAT END, WE'VE ASKED SOME

26:02.069 --> 26:03.039
PEOPLE THAT THEY MIGHT BE MORE

26:03.059 --> 26:04.069
WILLING TO LISTEN TO TO HELP YOU

26:04.089 --> 26:06.000
START A CONVERSATION.

26:06.019 --> 26:07.119
FOR INSTANCE, LET'S SAY YOUR

26:07.140 --> 26:08.220
CONFUSED GRANDPARENTS ARE

26:08.240 --> 26:09.210
PASSING AROUND DANGEROUS

26:09.230 --> 26:10.210
MISINFORMATION ABOUT NOT WEARING

26:10.230 --> 26:12.039
A MASK.

26:12.059 --> 26:13.240
THEY MAY NOT LISTEN TO ME, BUT

26:13.259 --> 26:14.289
THEY MIGHT LISTEN TO THE MAN

26:15.009 --> 26:16.220
THEY'VE BEEN LETTING INTO THEIR

26:16.240 --> 26:17.190
HOME EVERY WEEKNIGHT TO CALMLY

26:17.210 --> 26:18.289
TELL THEM WHAT IS AND ISN'T

26:19.009 --> 26:21.109
CORRECT.

26:21.130 --> 26:23.059
>> HI, EVERYONE, THE ANSWER IS:

26:23.079 --> 26:26.029
"ALEX TREBEK."

26:26.049 --> 26:28.019
THE CORRECT QUESTION, OF COURSE:

26:28.039 --> 26:29.000
"WHO IS THAT HANDSOME MAN I'M

26:29.019 --> 26:31.039
LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW?"

26:31.059 --> 26:32.140
>> John: YEAH.

26:32.160 --> 26:34.009
WE GOT ALEX TREBEK TO MAKE A

26:34.029 --> 26:35.160
90-SECOND VIDEO GENTLY URGING

26:35.180 --> 26:37.029
ANYONE WHO WATCHES IT TO BE

26:37.049 --> 26:38.000
CAREFUL WITH WHAT THEY ENCOUNTER

26:38.019 --> 26:39.259
AND SHARE ONLINE.

26:39.279 --> 26:41.089
SO YOU COULD SHOW YOUR

26:41.109 --> 26:42.210
GRANDPARENTS THAT AND THEN TALK

26:42.230 --> 26:44.019
TO THEM ABOUT IT.

26:44.039 --> 26:45.140
BUT LET'S SAY YOU'VE GOT A

26:45.160 --> 26:46.130
COUSIN WHO'S NOT A JEOPARDY FAN.

26:46.150 --> 26:47.150
MAYBE THEY LIKE WRESTLING OR

26:47.170 --> 26:48.150
"FAST & FURIOUS" MOVIES.

26:48.170 --> 26:49.210
WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS,

26:49.230 --> 26:51.000
JOHN CENA'S GOT SOMETHING TO SAY

26:51.019 --> 26:52.279
TO THEM TOO.

26:53.000 --> 26:53.279
>> THERE'S A LOT OF

26:54.000 --> 26:54.210
OFFICIAL-LOOKING STUFF ON THE

26:54.230 --> 26:59.160
INTERNET.

26:59.180 --> 27:00.049
NOT ALL OF IT'S TRUE.

27:00.069 --> 27:01.000
AND THERE'S SOME STUFF THAT

27:01.019 --> 27:02.000
SEEMS FALSE BUT ISN'T,

27:02.019 --> 27:02.289
LIKE THIS ONE:

27:03.009 --> 27:04.099
JOHN OLIVER AND I ARE THE EXACT

27:04.119 --> 27:05.049
SAME AGE.

27:05.069 --> 27:06.200
YUP, BORN ON THE SAME YEAR ON

27:06.220 --> 27:09.009
THE EXACT SAME DAY.

27:09.029 --> 27:10.240
IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE THAT TWO

27:10.259 --> 27:14.150
HUMAN BODIES CAN AGE SO

27:14.170 --> 27:16.099
DIFFERENTLY, BUT IT'S TRUE.

27:16.119 --> 27:17.279
I CHECKED.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.240
AND IT'S IMPORTANT YOU DO THAT.

27:21.259 --> 27:32.000
SO BEFORE YOU BELIEVE A THEORY

27:32.019 --> 27:32.259
ABOUT THE PANDEMIC OR

27:32.279 --> 27:33.140
SHARE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THE

27:33.160 --> 27:34.009
PANDEMIC, IT'S GOOD TO KNOW

27:34.029 --> 27:34.200
WHERE THAT INFORMATION IS COMING

27:34.220 --> 27:37.150
FROM.

27:37.170 --> 27:38.039
>> John: YEAH.

27:38.059 --> 27:38.279
BOTH OF THOSE THINGS ARE TRUE.

27:39.000 --> 27:39.190
YOU SHOULD CHECK INFORMATION,

27:39.210 --> 27:40.079
AND WE ARE THE EXACT SAME AGE.

27:40.099 --> 27:41.069
IT'S A THING I THINK ABOUT EVERY

27:41.089 --> 27:41.150
BIRTHDAY.

27:41.170 --> 27:42.079
AND IT'S NOT JUST ALEX TREBEK

27:42.099 --> 27:43.009
AND JOHN CENA.

27:43.029 --> 27:44.000
WE HAVE AN ASSORTMENT OF TRULY

27:44.019 --> 27:45.059
BELOVED FIGURES, FROM PAUL RUDD

27:45.079 --> 27:46.059
TO CATHERINE O'HARA TO

27:46.079 --> 27:47.119
BILLY PORTER, EACH OF WHOM MADE

27:47.140 --> 27:49.109
MESSAGES TO URGE PEOPLE TO THINK

27:49.130 --> 27:49.240
MORE CRITICALLY.

27:49.259 --> 27:55.009
HERE'S JUST A TASTE:

27:55.029 --> 27:56.009
>> WHAT'S GOING ON, MY PEOPLE!

27:56.029 --> 27:59.210
IT'S ME, BILLY PORTER.

27:59.230 --> 28:03.059
>> HELLO, THEY ARE, I'M

28:03.079 --> 28:04.049
CATHERINE O'HARA.

28:04.069 --> 28:05.230
>> I'M PAUL RUDD.

28:05.250 --> 28:07.039
>> ALEX TREBEK.

28:07.059 --> 28:07.210
>> HEY, JOHN CENA HERE, WWE

28:07.230 --> 28:08.099
SUPERSTAR, ACTOR, INTERNET MEME,

28:08.119 --> 28:09.019
DESSERT LOVER, AND NUMBER 3 ON

28:09.039 --> 28:13.210
YOUR PARTNER'S FREE PASS LIST.

28:13.230 --> 28:14.089
>> I'M LITERALLY A SUPERHERO.

28:14.109 --> 28:17.130
THE SMALLEST ONE, BUT IT STILL

28:17.150 --> 28:17.200
COUNTS.

28:17.220 --> 28:20.019
>> I KNOW WE ARE LIVING IN SCARY

28:20.039 --> 28:20.079
TIMES.

28:20.099 --> 28:22.220
>> YOU'RE SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS.

28:22.240 --> 28:25.009
I THINK THAT IS AWESOME.

28:25.029 --> 28:27.279
>> THAT CURIOSITY, THAT'S GOOD.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.099
I'M CURIOUS TOO.

28:30.119 --> 28:32.079
>> IF NOBODY EVER ASKED

28:32.099 --> 28:32.160
QUESTIONS,

28:32.180 --> 28:33.049
"JEOPARDY" WOULD BE A VERY, VERY

28:33.069 --> 28:36.279
WEIRD SHOW.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.019
>> BUT YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL,

28:38.039 --> 28:38.269
'CAUSE THERE'S A LOT

28:38.289 --> 28:39.200
OF CONVINCING-LOOKING SHIT ON

28:39.220 --> 28:40.079
THE INTERNET, AND MOST OF IT

28:40.099 --> 28:43.180
AIN'T TRUE.

28:43.200 --> 28:45.019
>> YOU KNOW, I ONCE THOUGHT THAT

28:45.039 --> 28:45.279
I WAS DEAD BECAUSE #RIPPaulRudd

28:46.000 --> 28:48.200
WAS TRENDING.

28:48.220 --> 28:50.109
>> BEFORE YOU SHARE INFORMATION,

28:50.130 --> 28:52.200
IT IS GOOD TO KNOW WHERE THAT IS

28:52.220 --> 28:52.289
COMING FROM.

28:53.009 --> 28:55.180
>> IS IT A TRUSTED NEWS SOURCE?

28:55.200 --> 28:57.119
>> IF YOU'RE NOT SURE, CHECK.

28:57.140 --> 28:59.230
>> A GOOD WAY TO KNOW IF IT

28:59.250 --> 29:02.210
HOLDS WATER IS IF A MAJORITY OF

29:02.230 --> 29:04.029
TRUSTED SOURCES AGREE ON IT.

29:04.049 --> 29:06.000
>> AND FINALLY, THINK

29:06.019 --> 29:07.059
CRITICALLY.

29:07.079 --> 29:08.079
SPEAK WHAT YOU ARE SMART.

29:08.099 --> 29:10.009
>> YOU ARE SMART.

29:10.029 --> 29:10.150
>> YOU'RE

29:10.170 --> 29:10.220
I KNOW.

29:10.240 --> 29:13.029
YOU ARE A SMART COOKIE.

29:13.049 --> 29:13.140
I KNOW YOU ARE.

29:13.160 --> 29:14.230
YOU HAVE THE LOOK OF A SCHOLAR

29:14.250 --> 29:18.009
AND THE TASTE OF A MACARON.

29:18.029 --> 29:18.130
Y'ALL GOT BRAINS.

29:18.150 --> 29:19.000
USE THEM.

29:19.019 --> 29:19.269
USE IT LIKE IT'S THE FIRST ROLL

29:19.289 --> 29:20.180
OF TOILET PAPER IN A BRAND-NEW

29:20.200 --> 29:21.039
PACK, UNSPARINGLY AND WITH

29:21.059 --> 29:21.109
GUSTO!

29:21.130 --> 29:24.210
[LAUGHS]

29:24.230 --> 29:26.099
>> YOU HAVE COMMON SENSE.

29:26.119 --> 29:28.069
TRUST THAT PART OF YOUR BRAIN TO

29:28.089 --> 29:30.180
GUIDE YOU AS YOU EDUCATE

29:30.200 --> 29:35.039
YOURSELF, AND TRUST

29:35.059 --> 29:35.230
THAT I'M DOING

29:35.250 --> 29:36.140
WHAT I CAN TO HOP TO NUMBER 1 ON

29:36.160 --> 29:37.089
YOUR PARTNER'S FREE PASS LIST

29:37.109 --> 29:41.130
AND NUMBER 3 ON YOURS.

29:41.150 --> 29:44.009
>> HEY, BE SAFE OUT THERE.

29:44.029 --> 29:44.259
>> John: THAT'S ALL GOOD ADVICE!

29:44.279 --> 29:45.240
AND TO INCREASE THE CHANCE THAT

29:45.259 --> 29:46.130
CONSPIRACY THEORISTS STUMBLE ON

29:46.150 --> 29:46.289
THEM, WE'VE PUT THEIR FULL

29:47.009 --> 29:47.099
VIDEOS ONLINE AT

29:47.119 --> 29:48.069

29:48.089 --> 29:48.240
IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO START A

29:48.259 --> 29:49.130
CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE,

PICKING ONE OF THESE VIDEOS IS A

PRETTY GOOD ENTRY POINT.

TAKE OFF YOUR SHOES.
