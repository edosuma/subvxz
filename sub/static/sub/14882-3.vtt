He plays the Clippers

41:58.749 --> 41:58.815
He plays the Clippers

41:58.816 --> 41:59.917

41:59.917 --> 41:59.983
this weekend, so I thought he

41:59.984 --> 42:01.085
was gonna be there.

42:01.085 --> 42:01.151
was gonna be there.

42:05.456 --> 42:06.356
I would have said, like,

42:06.357 --> 42:06.423
I would have said, like,

42:06.423 --> 42:07.657
"Can I talk to you?

42:07.658 --> 42:07.724
"Can I talk to you?

42:16.367 --> 42:17.301
divorce happened, you were

42:17.301 --> 42:17.367
divorce happened, you were

42:17.368 --> 42:18.535
really grappling with that.

42:18.536 --> 42:18.602
really grappling with that.

42:18.602 --> 42:19.402
It wasn't like you were, like,

42:19.403 --> 42:19.469
It wasn't like you were, like,

42:19.470 --> 42:20.404
"Yo, let me get a divorce.

42:20.404 --> 42:20.470
"Yo, let me get a divorce.

42:20.471 --> 42:21.338
All right, cool."

42:21.338 --> 42:21.404
All right, cool."

42:21.405 --> 42:22.539
Like, that wasn't a easy

42:22.540 --> 42:22.606
Like, that wasn't a easy

42:22.606 --> 42:23.506
decision for you.

42:23.507 --> 42:23.573
decision for you.

42:23.574 --> 42:24.374
I was there for all of it.

42:24.375 --> 42:24.441
I was there for all of it.

42:24.441 --> 42:26.042
You were in my house crying.

42:26.043 --> 42:26.109
You were in my house crying.

42:26.110 --> 42:28.178
>> KIM: Yeah.

42:30.014 --> 42:30.748

42:30.748 --> 42:30.814
>> LALA: Did this just stress

42:30.814 --> 42:32.849
you out, or no?

42:35.819 --> 42:38.054
>> KIM: No.

42:38.055 --> 42:38.121
>> KIM: No.

42:38.122 --> 42:39.289
I'm a little disappointed Kris

42:39.290 --> 42:39.356
I'm a little disappointed Kris

42:39.356 --> 42:40.690
didn't show up, but there's

42:40.691 --> 42:40.757
didn't show up, but there's

42:40.758 --> 42:41.825
nothing I can really do.

42:41.825 --> 42:41.891
nothing I can really do.

42:41.892 --> 42:42.792
I don't want to stress out about

42:42.793 --> 42:42.859
I don't want to stress out about

42:42.860 --> 42:43.794
it anymore.

42:43.794 --> 42:43.860
it anymore.

42:43.861 --> 42:44.895
So, you know, I just have to be

42:44.895 --> 42:44.961
So, you know, I just have to be

42:44.962 --> 42:46.496
calm and collected.

42:46.497 --> 42:46.563
calm and collected.

42:46.564 --> 42:48.432
And I'm just relieved that this

42:48.432 --> 42:48.498
And I'm just relieved that this

42:48.499 --> 42:49.833
is, you know, the first step

42:49.833 --> 42:49.899
