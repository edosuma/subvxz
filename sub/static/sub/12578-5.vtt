YOU CAN TIP IT, YOU CAN
RUN IT OVER WITH YOUR TRUCK

00:52.533 --> 00:54.567
YOU CAN DROP IT FROM THE MOON

00:54.633 --> 00:57.900
AND PROVIDED IT MADE IT
THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE

00:57.967 --> 01:01.733

I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOUR GIRLFRIEND

03:10.600 --> 03:12.600

03:12.667 --> 03:15.400
MY PARENTS WON'T EVEN
LET ME GO IN A CHAT ROOM.

03:15.467 --> 03:18.567
I KNOW. AND MY DAD SAID
WE COULD CAMP OUT

03:18.633 --> 03:22.433

THIS IS A GREAT
DINNER, MRS. HILL.

04:40.667 --> 04:43.067
WELL, WE HAVE YOUR MOTHER
TO THANK FOR THAT.

04:43.133 --> 04:46.800
SHE RECOMMENDED THAT I STIR
THE MACARONI WITH A SPOON.

04:46.867 --> 04:48.733
NO MORE BURNED HANDS, HANK.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.933
AND THE STEAK TASTES SO...
CLEAN.

04:52.067 --> 04:53.800
WELL, THAT'S THE PROPANE,
CONNIE.

04:53.867 --> 04:56.700
YOU SEE, IT'S A MUCH SMOOTHER
GRILL THAN CHARCOAL.

04:56.767 --> 04:58.500
AND AT A FRACTION OF THE COST.

04:58.567 --> 05:00.667
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED?

05:00.733 --> 05:02.767
PROPANE IS CALLED
LIQUID PETROLEUM.

05:02.833 --> 05:04.567
BUT ISN'T IT A GAS, MR. HILL?

05:04.633 --> 05:08.067
PLEASE, CONNIE, CALL ME HANK.

05:08.133 --> 05:10.067
Connie:
...AND MY DAD
JUST CRAWLED

05:10.067 --> 05:11.733
OUT THE WINDOW
AND NEVER PAID.

05:11.800 --> 05:13.567
SO, THIS IS GOSSIP.

05:13.633 --> 05:14.800
( chuckles )

05:14.867 --> 05:16.400
WELL, IT'S PRETTY GOOD.

05:16.467 --> 05:17.800
IF YOU'RE DONE,
MRS. HILL

05:17.867 --> 05:19.767
I'LL TAKE YOUR
PLATE IN WITH MINE.

05:19.833 --> 05:21.567
AND SHE HAS
MANNERS, TOO.

05:21.633 --> 05:24.333
MAY I TAKE THOSE PLATES
OUT OF YOUR WAY, SIR?

05:24.400 --> 05:28.067
AND CAN I TEMPT YOU
WITH SOME TOASTER STRUDELS?

05:28.100 --> 05:30.467
OR ARE WE WATCHING OUR FIGURES?

05:30.533 --> 05:32.333
JUST TAKE THE PLATES, BOBBY.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.667
VERY GOOD, SIR.

05:42.633 --> 05:45.567

HUNK OF FAT ON THIS ONE.

05:45.633 --> 05:46.567

05:46.633 --> 05:48.233
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.733
IT'S PRETTY DARK.

06:20.800 --> 06:22.833
ARE YOU SCARED?

06:22.900 --> 06:24.533
IT'S NOT THAT
DARK IN HERE.

06:24.600 --> 06:27.800

DOES NOT KISS AND TELL.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.733
- YOU CHICKENED OUT.
- YES, SIR, I DID.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.733
NOW SHE'S GOING TO THINK
YOU DON'T LIKE HER.

06:53.800 --> 06:55.067
I KNOW.

06:55.133 --> 06:56.467
DON'T WORRY.

06:56.533 --> 06:58.400
I'M BUSTING A MOVE TONIGHT.

06:58.467 --> 07:00.367
( Bobby yawns )

07:00.433 --> 07:02.600
BOY, I'M SO TIRED.

07:02.667 --> 07:04.567
I'D BETTER HURRY UP
AND GET TO BED

07:04.633 --> 07:07.200
BEFORE I FALL ASLEEP
RIGHT HERE AT THE TABLE.

07:07.267 --> 07:10.467
UGH. HOW MANY COWS
DO YOU PEOPLE EAT IN A YEAR?

07:10.533 --> 07:13.067
WAIT. WE FIGURED THIS OUT ONCE.

07:13.067 --> 07:14.900
CAN I PLEASE
BE EXCUSED?

07:14.967 --> 07:16.367
UH... WELL, SURE.

07:16.433 --> 07:18.767
ME, TOO, PLEASE.

07:27.567 --> 07:30.333
YOU RUSHED OFF
BEFORE DESSERT

07:30.400 --> 07:31.833
AND I TOOK THE LIBERTY

07:31.900 --> 07:34.700
OF SNAGGING US EACH
A PIECE OF BUNDT CAKE.

07:34.767 --> 07:36.367
I JUST BRUSHED MY TEETH.

07:36.433 --> 07:38.233
SO DID I.

07:38.300 --> 07:39.667
IF YOU JUST
BRUSHED YOUR TEETH

07:39.733 --> 07:41.700
THEN WHY ARE YOU GOING
TO EAT BUNDT CAKE?

07:41.767 --> 07:44.233
YOU'RE JUST GOING
TO HAVE TO BRUSH
YOUR TEETH AGAIN.

07:44.300 --> 07:46.267
WHY DON'T YOU
EVER THINK?

07:52.467 --> 07:54.067
( groans )

07:54.133 --> 07:57.400
CONNIE, DO YOU LIKE
YOUR SYRUP WARM OR COLD?

07:57.467 --> 07:59.733
PERSONALLY, I COULD
GO EITHER WAY.

07:59.800 --> 08:02.233
CAN YOU BOTHER SOMEONE ELSE
FOR FIVE MINUTES

08:02.300 --> 08:03.800
SO I CAN GO
TO THE BATHROOM?

08:03.867 --> 08:05.200
YES.

08:08.533 --> 08:10.533
CONNIE, HONEY,
IT'S PAST 8:00 ALREADY.

08:10.600 --> 08:12.267
UM...

08:12.333 --> 08:15.333
I DO NOT KNOW
WHAT SHE'S DOING
IN THERE FOR SO LONG.

08:15.400 --> 08:17.333
I THINK SHE'S TAKING
A BOBBY BREAK.

08:17.400 --> 08:20.333
HANK, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO TAKE CONNIE TO SCHOOL, HONEY.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.733
BOBBY AND I
ARE LATE ALREADY

08:21.800 --> 08:23.533
AND THERE ARE
NO SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS

08:23.600 --> 08:25.400
FOR SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS
WHO ARE LATE.

08:25.467 --> 08:27.300

08:34.067 --> 08:35.933
IS MRS. HILL HOME?

08:36.067 --> 08:38.100
NO. SHE LEFT
FOR SCHOOL ALREADY.

08:38.167 --> 08:39.667

MY FIRST PERIOD."

08:53.867 --> 08:55.167
BAAAAAH!

08:58.067 --> 08:59.867
OH, GOD.

09:00.067 --> 09:02.267
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO WORRY ABOUT
A THING, CONNIE.

09:02.333 --> 09:05.267
I PASSED THE OSHA
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT
COURSE ALL NINE YEARS.

09:05.333 --> 09:07.067
I WAS REQUIRED TO TAKE IT.

09:07.100 --> 09:08.667
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

09:08.733 --> 09:09.833
PRETTY SURE.

09:09.900 --> 09:11.067
( groans )

09:11.067 --> 09:12.667

DON'T WORRY, CONNIE.

09:18.367 --> 09:20.600
WE'RE GOING TO GET
THROUGH THIS SOMEHOW.

09:20.667 --> 09:23.700
OKAY, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW TO TIE A TOURNIQUET?

09:23.767 --> 09:24.867
NO.

09:24.933 --> 09:26.300
( sobbing )

09:26.367 --> 09:27.633
OH, MAN!

09:27.700 --> 09:29.933
THIS IS THE BEST
SPEECH EVER WRITTEN.

NOTHING ON ME.

WHERE WE MAKE CRAZY LOVE.

09:41.600 --> 09:42.700
OH, YEAH!

09:42.767 --> 09:46.067
I AM BAD BOY OF
SYSTEMS ANALYSIS.

09:47.067 --> 09:48.700
( cell phone ringing )

09:55.400 --> 09:56.800
Man:
Tom Landry Middle School.

09:56.867 --> 09:59.300
I NEED TO SPEAK
WITH MRS. PEGGY HILL.

09:59.367 --> 10:00.733
I'M SORRY. DISTRICT POLICY

10:00.800 --> 10:03.200
PROHIBITS DISTURBING
A TEACHER IN THE CLASSROOM.

10:03.267 --> 10:06.167
PEGGY IS MY WIFE, AND I WANT
HER DISTURBED RIGHT NOW.

10:06.233 --> 10:08.133
I'll connect you
to her voice mail.

10:08.200 --> 10:09.133
NO, BUT I...

10:09.200 --> 10:11.133
The person you have reached...

10:11.200 --> 10:12.933
Hello. This is Peggy Hill.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.367
I am so sorry
I cannot take your call.

10:15.433 --> 10:16.933
Please leave a message.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.267
...is not available.

10:18.333 --> 10:19.767
To leave a message...

10:21.000 --> 10:22.200
( phone ringing )

10:23.200 --> 10:24.400
HELLO?

10:24.467 --> 10:25.933
HMM...

10:26.000 --> 10:27.633
UM...

10:27.700 --> 10:29.400
Hello?

10:29.467 --> 10:31.200
AAH!

10:45.467 --> 10:47.167
IS SHE GOING TO BE OKAY?

10:47.233 --> 10:48.400
SHE'S GOING TO BE FINE.

10:48.467 --> 10:49.800
I'VE TAKEN CARE
OF THINGS FOR NOW

10:49.867 --> 10:51.700
BUT HERE IS A LIST OF
PRODUCTS FOR CONNIE

10:51.767 --> 10:53.500
WHICH YOU CAN PICK
UP AT ANY PHARMACY.

10:53.567 --> 10:56.500
OH... COULDN'T YOU JUST
GIVE HER THIS STUFF?

10:56.567 --> 10:57.867
YOU ARE A HOSPITAL.

10:57.933 --> 10:59.867
NO. YOU HAVE TO
GO AND BUY THEM.

11:00.067 --> 11:01.767
I MEAN, LET'S SAY
I GOT STITCHES.

11:01.833 --> 11:04.400
YOU MIGHT SEND ME HOME
WITH A BOX OF BAND-AIDS

11:04.467 --> 11:06.067
IF I ASKED FOR THEM,
RIGHT?

11:06.133 --> 11:08.933
BAND-AIDS AREN'T
GOING TO WORK IN
THIS SITUATION.

11:09.067 --> 11:10.967
PLEASE, DON'T
TRY BAND-AIDS.

11:16.533 --> 11:18.067
( groans )

11:18.067 --> 11:19.533
"AISLE 8A."

11:19.600 --> 11:22.200
BOY, WE SURE ARE A LONG WAY
FROM AUTOMOTIVE.

11:22.267 --> 11:23.433
YOU HAVE YOUR LIST?

11:23.500 --> 11:25.333
YES. JUST BECAUSE
I STARTED MY PERIOD

11:25.400 --> 11:27.900
DOESN'T MEAN I CAN'T HOLD
ON TO A PIECE OF PAPER.

11:27.967 --> 11:31.533
OKAY, THEN, I'LL JUST, UH,
WAIT RIGHT HERE FOR YOU.

11:41.300 --> 11:42.933
( sighs )

11:43.067 --> 11:45.400
COME ON, CONNIE, PICK SOMETHING.

11:45.467 --> 11:48.233
ANYTHING. DON'T MAKE ME
COME DOWN THERE.

11:48.300 --> 11:49.667
OH...

11:49.733 --> 11:51.333
OH!

11:51.400 --> 11:52.900
AW... NO.

11:52.967 --> 11:54.733
HOLD ON, CONNIE.

11:54.800 --> 11:57.067
THIS REALLY
SUCKS, MR. HILL.

11:57.067 --> 11:59.067
MY MOM TAUGHT
ME NOTHING.

11:59.067 --> 12:02.767
$6.95 FOR ONE
STUPID BOX?!

12:02.833 --> 12:05.600
OH, I ONLY HAVE
FIVE DOLLARS.

12:05.667 --> 12:07.867
CAN I BORROW TWO
STUPID DOLLARS?

12:07.933 --> 12:10.067
IT-IT'S OKAY, CONNIE.
IT'S ON ME.

12:10.067 --> 12:12.833
WE'LL GET YOU
ALL SET UP HERE.

12:15.833 --> 12:17.833
OH... CHUCK.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.067
Connie:
YOU KNOW, MR. HILL

12:22.067 --> 12:24.667
MAYBE THIS ISN'T SUCH
A BIG DEAL AFTER ALL.

12:24.733 --> 12:26.200
NOPE. NOT SUCH
A BIG DEAL.

12:26.267 --> 12:28.400
IN FACT, THIS IS
SUCH A LITTLE DEAL

12:28.467 --> 12:31.167
THAT WE WON'T HAVE TO
TALK ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

12:31.233 --> 12:34.267
NOW, HOW DO I CHANGE
ONE OF THESE THINGS?

12:44.200 --> 12:46.067
DUH, INCOMING!

12:48.667 --> 12:50.067
I CAN'T LOOK.

12:50.067 --> 12:53.867
SHE NEVER EVEN GOT TO SEE
HER FIRST TRASH DAY.

12:53.933 --> 12:55.533
( gasps )

12:55.600 --> 12:56.867
HA-HA!

12:56.933 --> 12:58.667
BIG BAD CAN!

12:58.733 --> 13:00.700
WHERE'S BOBBY?

13:00.767 --> 13:02.333
IT'S CONNIE.

13:02.400 --> 13:03.900
HANK, WHAT IS IT!

13:03.967 --> 13:07.133
YOU KNOW,
THE SPECIAL TIME

13:07.200 --> 13:09.133
IN GIRLS' LIVES

13:09.200 --> 13:11.367
AND FRESHNESS
AND ALL THAT?

13:11.433 --> 13:12.900
OH, MY LORD.

13:12.967 --> 13:14.233
OH, POOR CONNIE.

13:14.300 --> 13:15.900
POOR CONNIE? POOR ME.

13:15.967 --> 13:18.733
I HAD TO LEARN ABOUT
MEGA ABSORBENCY.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.467
YOU WENT DOWN AISLE 8A?

13:20.533 --> 13:22.800
WE HAVE BEEN MARRIED
FOR 20 YEARS

13:22.867 --> 13:25.200
AND I CAN'T GET
YOU PAST AISLE 5.

13:25.267 --> 13:26.600
I WASN'T JOYRIDING, PEGGY.

13:26.667 --> 13:28.133
IT WAS A MEDICAL EMERGENCY.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.167
WELL, WHY DIDN'T
YOU CALL ME SOONER?

13:30.233 --> 13:31.467
I TRIED CALLING YOU.

13:31.533 --> 13:33.500
I TRIED CALLING MINH AND KAHN.

13:33.567 --> 13:35.667
I EVEN HUNG UP ON MY OWN MOTHER.

13:35.733 --> 13:37.600
AND SHE'S SUCH A NICE WOMAN.

13:37.667 --> 13:39.267
WELL, HANK, YOU
DID YOUR BEST

13:39.333 --> 13:40.600
BUT I'M IN CHARGE NOW.

13:40.667 --> 13:42.467
YOU KEEP TRYING
MINH AND KAHN.

13:42.533 --> 13:43.900
I'LL TALK TO CONNIE

13:43.967 --> 13:45.567
AND THEN I'LL TALK TO BOBBY.

13:45.633 --> 13:47.733
I DON'T THINK BOBBY
SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS.

13:47.800 --> 13:49.700
IT'S BAD ENOUGH
THAT I KNOW ABOUT THIS.

13:49.767 --> 13:52.100
DO YOU WANT TO BE
IN CHARGE, HANK?
NO.

13:53.633 --> 13:54.800
UH-OH.

13:54.867 --> 13:56.733
LAST TIME YOU WERE
WAITING FOR ME

13:56.800 --> 13:58.567
I LEARNED ABOUT
GOLDFISH HEAVEN.

13:58.633 --> 13:59.567
COME ON, BOBBY.

13:59.633 --> 14:00.967
LET'S GO TO WHATABURGER.

14:01.067 --> 14:02.267
ALL RIGHT!

14:02.333 --> 14:03.433
OH, GOD.

14:03.500 --> 14:04.867
WHERE'S LADYBIRD?

14:04.933 --> 14:08.333
I NOW PASS THE TORCH
TO MY GOOD FRIEND

14:08.400 --> 14:10.533
KAHN SOUPHANOUSINPHONE.

14:10.600 --> 14:11.967
( applause )

14:12.067 --> 14:15.100
( cell phone rings )

14:15.167 --> 14:16.900
HELLO?

14:16.967 --> 14:19.067
OH, HANK HILL! WHAT YOU WANT?

14:19.067 --> 14:20.933
KAHN IS AT THE PODIUM!

14:21.067 --> 14:22.067
OH!

14:22.067 --> 14:24.067
Kahn:
GENTLEMEN AND LADIES

14:24.067 --> 14:26.433
OF SYSTEMS ANALYSIS

14:26.500 --> 14:30.533
WHAT REALLY BRING US TOGETHER
HERE?

14:30.600 --> 14:32.900
SYSTEMS OR THE SUNSHINE?

14:32.967 --> 14:36.900
I THINK WE DO BEST TO REMEMBER
THE WORDS OF MAYA ANGELOU...

14:36.967 --> 14:38.333
( screams )

14:42.833 --> 14:46.333
BOBBY, YOU ARE AT AN AGE
NOW WHEN...

14:46.400 --> 14:48.333
WELL, THINGS ARE
STARTING TO CHANGE.

14:48.400 --> 14:51.100
AND, WHILE SOME THINGS ARE
BETTER LEARNED THROUGH GUESSING

14:51.167 --> 14:52.567
OR CERTAIN EDUCATIONAL FILMS

14:52.633 --> 14:54.900
SOME THINGS ARE BETTER LEARNED
FROM YOUR PARENTS.

14:54.967 --> 14:57.600
MOM, WHY DON'T YOU
GATHER YOUR THOUGHTS

14:57.667 --> 15:00.600
WHILE I GET ANOTHER ORDER
OF ONION RINGS.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.300
CONNIE STARTED
HER PERIOD.

15:02.367 --> 15:03.467
WHAT'S THAT, NOW?

15:03.533 --> 15:04.967
SHE HAS TAKEN
HER FIRST STEPS

15:05.067 --> 15:06.133
TO BECOMING A WOMAN.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.333
SHE CAN'T BE A WOMAN.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.067
I'M STILL A KID.

15:09.133 --> 15:12.133
LOOK AT ME.
I EVEN GOT THE KID'S MEAL.

15:12.200 --> 15:13.467
I LOVE THIS TOY!

15:13.533 --> 15:14.700
OH, BOBBY.

15:14.767 --> 15:17.600
HONEY, YOU WILL
CATCH UP EVENTUALLY.

15:17.667 --> 15:20.200
THIS YEAR, NEXT YEAR,
IT DOES NOT MATTER WHEN

15:20.267 --> 15:21.700
BECAUSE YOU
WILL ALWAYS BE

15:21.767 --> 15:23.400
MOMMY'S LITTLE MAN.

15:23.467 --> 15:24.700
( groaning )

15:26.467 --> 15:28.667
SO... CONNIE

15:28.733 --> 15:31.133
YOU WANT TO GO JUMP
OFF THE BIKE RAMP?

15:31.200 --> 15:32.300
NO.

15:32.367 --> 15:33.667
PLAY SOCCER?
NO.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.733
GO SWIMMING AT
THE REC CENTER?

15:35.800 --> 15:36.933
( sighing )

15:37.067 --> 15:39.133
YOU KNOW WHAT I
WANT TO DO, BOBBY?

15:39.200 --> 15:40.267
SIT HERE!

15:40.333 --> 15:42.533
FINE! YOU SIT
ON THAT COUCH!

15:42.600 --> 15:45.533
I'M YOUNG.
I'M YOUNG AND ALIVE

15:45.600 --> 15:49.467
AND I'M GOING OUTSIDE
TO ENJOY LIFE!

16:08.267 --> 16:11.867
WORD IS, CONNIE'S
AUNT FLO IS IN TOWN.

16:11.933 --> 16:15.133
YEAH, PROBABLY BECAUSE
SHE STARTED HER PERIOD.

16:15.200 --> 16:18.333
SHE'S GOT THE CURSE,
AND I THINK I CAUSED IT--

16:18.400 --> 16:22.100
ALL MY HORMONES BEING
TOO CLOSE TO HER HORMONES.

16:22.167 --> 16:23.767
IT'S ALL OVER, BOBBY.

16:23.833 --> 16:26.100
I HEARD
THAT WHEN GIRLS GET THE CURSE

16:26.167 --> 16:29.667
THEY ONLY GO OUT WITH HAIRY
HIGH SCHOOL GUYS WITH CARS.

16:29.733 --> 16:32.600
I'VE GOT PEACH FUZZ AND A BIKE.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.900
WHERE IS MY DAUGHTER?!

16:36.967 --> 16:38.067
I WANT TO WAKE HER UP

16:38.133 --> 16:40.067
FROM THIS CHICKEN-
FRIED NIGHTMARE.

16:40.067 --> 16:41.067
MOM!

16:41.100 --> 16:42.700
DAD!

16:42.767 --> 16:45.700
IT IS VERY NICE
TO SEE YOU AGAIN, KAHN JR.

16:45.767 --> 16:47.367
GO WITH YOUR MOTHER, YES.

16:47.433 --> 16:49.067
YOU KNOW, YOU
CAN THANK ME

16:49.100 --> 16:51.333
FOR TAKING CARE
OF THIS, KAHN.

16:51.400 --> 16:53.067
IT WASN'T EXACTLY EASY.

16:53.067 --> 16:54.067
THANK YOU?

16:54.133 --> 16:55.867
YOU LUCKY I
DON'T SUE YOU.

16:55.933 --> 16:57.867
LUCK HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

16:57.933 --> 16:59.333
YOU'VE GOT NO CASE.

17:02.367 --> 17:03.933
THERE'S STILL TIME.
HURRY.

17:04.067 --> 17:05.867
SHE'S GOT ROOM
FOR THREE MORE.

17:17.532 --> 17:20.333
HEY, MAN, DANG OL', WHAT
YOU DOING, OL' TRASH MAN?

17:20.400 --> 17:23.833
NO TAKIN', I'M 'BOUT
GONNA CALL 911, MAN.

17:23.900 --> 17:26.433
EVERYTHING I LOVE
IS TAKEN FROM ME!

17:26.500 --> 17:28.867
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

17:28.933 --> 17:31.533
SHE WAS MY CAN.

17:31.600 --> 17:34.533
Narrator:
The mother sings a gentle song

17:34.600 --> 17:38.100
welcoming her calf
to a watery new world.

17:38.167 --> 17:41.100
OH, MINH! SHE
DOING IT AGAIN.

17:41.167 --> 17:42.433
HELP ME.

17:42.500 --> 17:43.767
MAKE HER STOP.

17:43.833 --> 17:44.967
I'M ON IT.

17:45.067 --> 17:46.800
( sniffling )

17:46.867 --> 17:49.133
MOM, I WAS REALLY MEAN
TO BOBBY

17:49.200 --> 17:50.767
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY.

17:50.833 --> 17:52.600
HE ANNOYING LITTLE BOY.

17:52.667 --> 17:53.833
MOM!

17:53.900 --> 17:56.867
KAHN JR., YOU HAVE A P.M.S.

17:56.933 --> 18:00.667
IT'S HARD,
BUT VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND.

18:00.733 --> 18:05.067
YOU JUST YELL AND YELL
OR YOU JUST CRY AND CRY.

18:05.067 --> 18:08.400
BUT IT FEELS LIKE I'M DOING
BOTH OF THOSE AT THE SAME TIME.

18:08.467 --> 18:10.933
CONNIE,
YOU FEEL THINGS MORE NOW.

18:11.067 --> 18:12.933
MAKE SAD MOVIES TRULY EXCELLENT.

18:13.067 --> 18:15.467
YOU WATCH TITANIC
ON THE RIGHT DAY

18:15.533 --> 18:17.133
IT BLOW YOU AWAY.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.933
AND YOU GET INTUITION.

18:19.067 --> 18:20.933
AND I GET TO HAVE BABIES.

18:21.067 --> 18:23.500
WHOA! SLOW DOWN, KAHN JR.

18:23.567 --> 18:25.933
I TELL YOU NOW WHAT
MY MOTHER TOLD ME.

18:26.067 --> 18:27.800
( speaking Laotian )

18:27.867 --> 18:28.800
...BOBBY HILL...

18:28.867 --> 18:30.133
( speaking Laotian )

18:30.200 --> 18:31.700
MOM, YOU DON'T KNOW BOBBY.

18:31.767 --> 18:33.733
HE'S NOT LIKE
ALL THE OTHER BOYS.

18:33.800 --> 18:35.333
ALL MEN ARE THE SAME.

18:35.400 --> 18:37.500
BUT NOW YOU ARE DIFFERENT

18:37.567 --> 18:40.900
AND YOU MUST ACT DIFFERENT,
LIKE AN ADULT.

18:40.967 --> 18:43.333
EXCEPT AT MOVIE THEATER,
WHERE YOU CHILD

18:43.400 --> 18:45.800
AND YOUR FATHER
AND I STUDENTS.

18:47.533 --> 18:49.500
( sighing )

18:49.567 --> 18:52.667
UH... SO, UH...

18:52.733 --> 18:55.900
DR. HERTIG SAYS
YOUR TEETH ARE LOOKING GOOD.

18:55.967 --> 18:57.500
THAT A BOY.

18:57.567 --> 18:59.333
DAD, I THINK
CONNIE IS GOING

18:59.400 --> 19:02.133
TO BREAK UP WITH ME
BECAUSE SHE HATES ME.

19:02.200 --> 19:03.533
SHE DOESN'T HATE YOU.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.100
YES, SHE DOES.

19:05.167 --> 19:08.133
SHE'S NO LONGER THE GIRL
WHO FELL IN LOVE WITH ME.

19:08.200 --> 19:11.200
NOW SHE'S JUST THE WOMAN
WHO YELLS AT ME.

19:12.633 --> 19:15.667
BOBBY, EVERY WOMAN
HAS A PERIOD...

19:15.733 --> 19:18.300
UH, OF TIME, EVERY MONTH...

19:18.367 --> 19:20.200
EVEN MOM?

19:20.267 --> 19:22.100
BOBBY, IF WE'RE GOING
TO GET THROUGH THIS

19:22.167 --> 19:24.567
YOU CANNOT ASK ME
QUESTIONS LIKE THAT.

19:24.633 --> 19:25.867
MY BAD.

19:25.933 --> 19:28.900
NOW, EVERY MONTH
A WOMAN HAS THIS TIME

19:28.967 --> 19:31.733
WHEN SHE GETS VERY
ANGRY AT EVERYTHING.

19:31.800 --> 19:34.267
AND USUALLY
MEN ARE THE EVERYTHING.

19:34.333 --> 19:35.933
IT'S LIKE A TIRE FIRE.

19:36.067 --> 19:38.667
TRYING TO PUT IT OUT
ONLY MAKES IT WORSE.

19:38.733 --> 19:41.267
YOU JUST GOT TO LET IT BURN.

19:41.333 --> 19:43.700
GRAB A BEER AND LET IT BURN.

19:45.967 --> 19:47.900
HANK HILL,
YOU RUIN MY LIFE.

19:47.967 --> 19:49.667
WHAT CAN I
DO FOR YOU?

19:49.733 --> 19:51.900
UH, CONNIE LEFT
SOME THINGS AT MY HOUSE.

19:51.967 --> 19:53.933
I THOUGHT SHE MIGHT
WANT THEM BACK.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.133
HEY, MR. HILL.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.233
THANKS FOR LETTING
ME STAY WITH YOU.

19:57.300 --> 19:58.800
SORRY IT WAS
SO BORING.

19:58.867 --> 20:00.867
( nervous chuckle ):
YEP.

20:02.467 --> 20:04.733
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!

20:04.800 --> 20:06.633
WHY DIDN'T SHE CRY AT YOU?

20:06.700 --> 20:08.933
ALL SHE EVER DOES
IS CRY AT ME.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.133
IT'S NOT FAIR.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.200
I MAKE MORE
MONEY THAN YOU.

20:12.267 --> 20:14.900
I THINK IT'S BEEN
A LONG DAY FOR ALL OF US.

20:14.967 --> 20:16.467
TOMORROW'LL BE EASIER.

20:16.533 --> 20:17.933
FOR ME, ANYWAY.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.333
SURE, EVERYTHING
EASY FOR YOU.

20:20.400 --> 20:21.933
YOU WORLD'S BEST FATHER.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.800
I SEEN THE MUG!

20:23.867 --> 20:24.800
ME?

20:24.867 --> 20:26.333
I'M NOTHING.

20:26.400 --> 20:28.300
I WANT MUG, TOO, HANK HILL.

20:28.367 --> 20:30.067
WELL, I JUST SO
HAPPEN TO HAVE

20:30.133 --> 20:32.300
A BOOK HERE THAT MIGHT
HELP YOU OUT WITH THAT.

20:32.367 --> 20:33.800
OH, AND, UH, I ADDED

20:33.867 --> 20:36.333
AN EXTRA CHAPTER
AT THE BEGINNING.

20:36.400 --> 20:37.600
AISLE 8A?

20:37.667 --> 20:39.800
WHAT IS AISLE 8A?

20:39.867 --> 20:42.800
YOU KNOW, IT'S THE ONE
NEXT TO THE DEODORANTS

20:42.867 --> 20:45.133
AND THE, UH... OINTMENTS.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.300
( groaning )

20:46.367 --> 20:47.867
YEAH, I KNOW.

20:53.800 --> 20:55.800
IS THIS A BAD TIME?

20:55.867 --> 20:58.467
MY MOM SAYS WE SHOULDN'T BE
ALONE TOGETHER ANYMORE

20:58.533 --> 21:00.533
AND THAT YOU ONLY WANT
ONE THING.

21:00.600 --> 21:05.300
DID SHE SAY WHAT THAT WAS?
BECAUSE I AM SO CONFUSED.

21:05.367 --> 21:06.633
ME, TOO.

21:06.700 --> 21:08.267
THIS SUCKS.

21:08.333 --> 21:10.667
SO NOW YOU'RE A WOMAN.

21:10.733 --> 21:13.300
TECHNICALLY, I THINK
I'M ONLY A WOMAN

21:13.367 --> 21:14.867
FOUR DAYS A MONTH.

21:14.933 --> 21:16.600
ONLY FOUR DAYS?

21:16.667 --> 21:18.867
WELL, THAT'S FOR MOST PEOPLE.

21:18.933 --> 21:20.800
BUT YOU'RE SUPER-ORGANIZED.

21:20.867 --> 21:24.200
I BET YOU CAN GET THROUGH IT
IN TWO DAYS.

21:24.267 --> 21:26.367
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.

21:26.433 --> 21:28.400
( sighing )

21:28.467 --> 21:31.533
YOU KNOW, IF I WAS
BECOMING A MAN

21:31.600 --> 21:33.300
I WOULDN'T DUMP YOU.

21:33.367 --> 21:35.633
I DON'T WANT
TO DUMP YOU, BOBBY.

21:35.700 --> 21:37.367
I STILL WANT TO BE
YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

21:37.433 --> 21:39.400
BUT FOR THOSE FOUR DAYS
WHEN I'M A WOMAN

21:39.467 --> 21:41.333
I DON'T WANT TO BE
ANYWHERE NEAR YOU.

21:41.400 --> 21:42.800
DEAL.

21:42.867 --> 21:45.067
I'LL SEE YOU
IN TWO DAYS!

22:26.967 --> 22:29.633
DO YOU WANT
TO BE IN CHARGE, HANK?
NO.
