<font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

02:28.680 --> 02:31.286
- Evening, Mr. Draper.
- Hello, Dawn.

02:31.440 --> 02:35.286
- Let me take your coat.
- It's 8:00. Do you mind?

02:35.440 --> 02:36.885
What is this?

02:37.040 --> 02:39.327
Sweet'N Low and Coffee-Mate.
I noticed you were out.

02:39.480 --> 02:42.051
Is this an elaborate plea for coffee?
I can make some.

02:42.200 --> 02:44.043
I really can't stay.

02:46.280 --> 02:48.203
Mrs. Draper did not
call this morning,

02:48.360 --> 02:50.283
but I arranged for a Valentine
bouquet to arrive

02:50.480 --> 02:53.086
in the afternoon her time,
so I'd expect a call here around dinner.

02:53.240 --> 02:54.890
Good girl.

02:55.040 --> 02:57.088
Mohawk Airlines?
Henry Lammott came in?

02:57.280 --> 02:59.681
He just dropped in.
He wanted to meet Lou.

02:59.840 --> 03:02.320
Huh.
Office or conference room?

03:02.480 --> 03:04.608
- Conference room.
- Where did he sit?

03:04.760 --> 03:06.649
- Who?
- Lou.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.768
I don't remember.

03:08.920 --> 03:10.649
How did Diners Club
go on Tuesday?

03:10.800 --> 03:13.201
It got pushed back for
a signing meeting with Handi-Wrap.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.966
More Dow?
How long has that been going on?

03:16.120 --> 03:17.884
I don't know.
It's Mr. Cosgrove.

03:18.040 --> 03:19.644
Clara's terrible with memos.

03:19.840 --> 03:22.571
- What creative team is on it?
- I don't know.

03:27.680 --> 03:29.967
- No other calls?
- No, Mr. Draper.

03:30.120 --> 03:33.249
I know, I know.
I told you, it's for carfare.

03:33.440 --> 03:36.683
Well, I've been thinking
about it a lot, actually.

03:36.840 --> 03:39.286
And you know I don't mind
keeping you aware of things.

03:39.440 --> 03:41.920
But there's something about the money
that makes it feel wrong.

03:42.080 --> 03:44.367
You're doing extra work.
You should get extra pay.

03:44.520 --> 03:46.443
It's no work at all.

03:46.600 --> 03:49.763
So I will continue to do
what I feel comfortable doing for free,

03:49.920 --> 03:51.809
which is answer your phone
and keep you up to date.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.525
That's all I ask for.

03:53.680 --> 03:56.604
No, you asked me to get you
photocopies of the Butler work

03:56.760 --> 03:58.524
and they're locked
in Peggy's office and I can't.

03:58.680 --> 04:00.045
I don't want you to do that.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.929
All right.
Good.

04:02.080 --> 04:04.048
But I want you to take this.

04:10.720 --> 04:12.802
- You take care.
- Of course.

04:12.960 --> 04:15.327
The cleaning woman
comes tomorrow morning.

04:39.240 --> 04:41.971
She says, "You look
like a working girl."

04:42.120 --> 04:44.726
And I thought she meant I looked
low-class like a secretary.

04:44.880 --> 04:47.167
But Petra said
she meant a prostitute.

04:47.320 --> 04:50.210
How the fuck does my mother know
what a prostitute looks like?

04:50.360 --> 04:51.805
How was Sarah?

04:51.960 --> 04:54.247
Below average.

04:54.400 --> 04:56.289
She wants me
to bring her Capezios,

04:56.480 --> 04:58.528
so I don't know
what I'm going to wear.

04:58.680 --> 05:01.081
Is it an open casket?

05:01.240 --> 05:03.288
I didn't ask.

05:03.440 --> 05:06.444
Sergeant Snorkel says we have
to come back on the 12:30.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.887
So back here by 3:00?

05:09.040 --> 05:10.530
The funeral's at 9:00.

05:10.680 --> 05:12.330
We see Sarah, boo-hoo.

05:12.480 --> 05:15.609
Maybe we leave a little early
because Sally's so upset.

05:15.760 --> 05:17.762
We get in a taxi to the cemetery,

05:17.960 --> 05:20.042
but we get out
in Greenwich Village.

05:20.200 --> 05:22.931
Two hours of shopping,
take another pumpkin to Grand Central.

05:23.080 --> 05:26.448
There's a boutique on MacDougal
that has Pocahontas boots.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.967
I am upset, Carol.

05:29.120 --> 05:32.249
Me, too.
I heard her dad's a mess.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.687
She was supposed to be
a great beauty.

05:34.840 --> 05:39.801
Sarah had this picture of her
wearing a bikini on Christmas.

05:39.960 --> 05:42.122
She took it with her.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.331
You know she's gonna
miss school till Easter?

05:46.480 --> 05:48.403
I wish my mom was dead.

05:48.560 --> 05:52.087
I'd stay here till 1975 if I could
get Betty in the ground.

05:52.240 --> 05:53.765
What are you wearing?

05:53.920 --> 05:56.127
I don't have anything black
but my turtleneck,

05:56.280 --> 05:59.602
so I thought I'd wear that with
my brown suede skirt and black tights.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.650
Jesus, Draper.
ls this your first funeral?

06:09.800 --> 06:11.370
Leave the lights off.

06:11.520 --> 06:13.409
How am I gonna find anything?

06:15.000 --> 06:17.924
Why do you have
to do this tonight?

06:26.440 --> 06:29.967
- Hey.
- Didn't you already sign Chevy?

06:30.160 --> 06:33.004
Can't you just add the business
onto their other contract?

06:33.200 --> 06:36.329
Sweetheart, let me
explain this to you.

06:36.480 --> 06:40.041
This is the Southern California
Chevrolet Dealers Association.

06:40.200 --> 06:43.170
Chevy's the factory,
this is the store.

06:45.560 --> 06:47.642
You're not listening to me.

06:58.280 --> 07:00.487
Just has to be there
when he wakes up.

07:00.640 --> 07:03.211
He's so drunk, he doesn't
even know where he is.

07:03.400 --> 07:04.970
That's why it has to be there
when he wakes up

07:05.120 --> 07:06.121
with a note that says,

07:06.320 --> 07:08.721
"You promised to sign this
no matter what."

07:10.680 --> 07:12.682
You are such a big deal.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.005
How'd it go?

07:20.560 --> 07:24.406
- I got 'em.
- Good work.

07:24.560 --> 07:27.040
- Good night, Bonnie.
- Good night.

07:34.280 --> 07:36.362
Hold that, please.

07:42.160 --> 07:45.164
- Hello, New York.
- Howdy.

07:45.360 --> 07:47.681
Oh, Michael,
very nice work on Butler.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.683
Stan, we're going to need
renderings, color.

07:55.440 --> 07:58.330
- How's Monday?
- Today is Friday.

07:58.480 --> 08:01.245
Whew, I'm buried all day
and I have plans tonight.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.562
So you can finish tonight
and have plans all weekend.

08:03.720 --> 08:05.563
- She's gonna find out.
- What?

08:07.280 --> 08:09.965
Maybe if you invite me,
you can have till Tuesday.

08:10.120 --> 08:13.442
We now all know you don't have
plans for Valentine's Day.

08:15.720 --> 08:17.449
Oh.

08:17.640 --> 08:19.688
She has plans.
Look at her calendar.

08:19.840 --> 08:22.650
"February 14,
masturbate gloomily."

08:23.640 --> 08:25.802
Monday is fine.

08:32.960 --> 08:35.167
Who are these from?

08:35.320 --> 08:37.890
Hard to believe
your cat has the money.

08:39.240 --> 08:41.082
Really lovely.

08:41.240 --> 08:44.722
Look at you,
every inch a girl.

08:44.920 --> 08:46.046
Is this some kind of joke?

08:46.200 --> 08:48.567
Just tell me now because I don't want
to have to fire you later.

08:50.040 --> 08:52.042
Enjoy your flowers, boss.

09:09.280 --> 09:10.770
Oh.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.922
Happy Valentine's Day, Shirley.

09:13.080 --> 09:15.811
And happy
Valentine's Day to you.

09:15.960 --> 09:19.328
Shirley, I see there's no card,

09:19.480 --> 09:22.643
but I'd like to know who sent me
these beautiful flowers.

09:23.640 --> 09:25.529
Well, actually--

09:25.680 --> 09:27.489
Oh.

09:29.880 --> 09:31.882
Oh.

09:32.040 --> 09:33.405
I understand now.

09:33.560 --> 09:35.528
Oh, good.

09:35.720 --> 09:37.563
Could you get me some coffee?

09:37.760 --> 09:39.364
What time is it on the coast?

09:39.520 --> 09:41.409
- Pardon?
- 6:00 a.m.

09:43.200 --> 09:44.531
I'll handle it.

09:45.840 --> 09:47.251
Could you get the door?

09:57.840 --> 09:59.251
Ted Chaough's office.

09:59.400 --> 10:00.686
Good morning, Moira.
It's Peggy.

10:00.840 --> 10:01.921
Where are you?

10:02.120 --> 10:05.920
I'm in my office, but I need you
to relay a message to Ted for me.

10:06.120 --> 10:07.724
Oh, okay.

10:08.800 --> 10:11.849
Tell him that
I got his message.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.324
No, tell him that
I relayed his message

10:16.480 --> 10:19.962
to the client and...

10:21.080 --> 10:23.287
And what?

10:23.440 --> 10:25.920
There's nothing he can do.

10:26.080 --> 10:27.525
They're not--

10:27.680 --> 10:29.444
they don't want to hear
any more pitches.

10:29.600 --> 10:31.489
The business is gone.

10:31.640 --> 10:32.721
Really?
What account?

10:32.880 --> 10:34.644
He'll know.

10:46.160 --> 10:48.686
Well, the snow's melted,
but not the hearts of New Yorkers.

10:48.840 --> 10:50.763
I just had some old lady
call me a "kike."

10:50.960 --> 10:52.883
- ls that right?
- Yeah.

10:53.040 --> 10:54.451
She was letting
her dog relieve himself

10:54.600 --> 10:56.329
and I said, "Pardon me,
but you want to curb that thing?"

10:56.480 --> 10:58.608
She says, "Mind
your own business, kike."

10:58.800 --> 11:01.280
Maybe it's the hat.

11:02.440 --> 11:04.442
The strangest things
happen to you.

11:06.640 --> 11:09.041
Hey, did you see this?

11:09.200 --> 11:11.441
Ogilvy signed Hershey.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.090
I hadn't heard that.

11:17.080 --> 11:19.447
She hates her because
she got a C in Western Civ.

11:19.600 --> 11:21.090
She corrects my English.

11:21.280 --> 11:23.089
I went to school in England.

11:24.720 --> 11:26.643
Are we going to walk
into school with these?

11:26.800 --> 11:28.564
We'll say they're Sarah's.

11:33.400 --> 11:35.767
Is my purse in your bag?

11:35.960 --> 11:39.681
The senior class sent her flowers
because they're all so concerned.

11:39.880 --> 11:41.962
Half of them think
her name is Sally.

11:42.120 --> 11:44.771
Shit, I must have left it
at the coffee shop.

11:44.920 --> 11:47.321
Maybe in the head shop?

11:47.480 --> 11:49.050
I'm just going to go up
and check at the counter.

11:49.200 --> 11:51.487
- I'll get your fare.
- No, my address book is in there.

11:51.640 --> 11:53.642
- It's everybody I know.
- We can't wait.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.167
There's another train
in a couple hours.

12:00.160 --> 12:03.004
- "Hello, Dawn."
- "Hello, Shirley."

12:03.200 --> 12:05.931
You shouldn't be taking a break
right where you are.

12:06.120 --> 12:09.602
I'm not. I'm getting her coffee.
And I'm taking my time.

12:09.760 --> 12:12.684
- What did she do now?
- It ain't funny.

12:12.840 --> 12:15.605
Charles sent me 12 long-stem roses
in a crystal vase

12:15.760 --> 12:17.683
and she took 'em.

12:17.880 --> 12:20.042
I was right at the photocopier
when she came in

12:20.200 --> 12:21.690
preparing her shit,
and somehow--

12:21.880 --> 12:23.245
'cause I put the card
in my purse,

12:23.400 --> 12:25.209
I guess because it said,
"I love you so"--

12:25.360 --> 12:26.566
she thought they were hers.

12:26.760 --> 12:29.286
Well, it was an honest mistake.

12:29.440 --> 12:31.204
Who the hell
is sending her flowers?

12:43.080 --> 12:44.684
Why didn't you say something?

12:44.840 --> 12:47.002
It was too late.
I tried.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.646
- You tried?
- I really did.

12:50.720 --> 12:54.406
Well, they're hers now.

12:54.560 --> 12:55.641
I'm gonna tell her.

12:55.800 --> 12:58.007
You want those flowers so bad,

12:58.160 --> 12:59.924
you'll take the trouble that comes
with getting them back?

13:00.080 --> 13:02.447
It's not right.

13:02.600 --> 13:05.843
Well, I have two bosses

13:06.000 --> 13:09.402
and one of them hasn't told
his wife he's on leave.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.364
Keep pretending.

13:11.560 --> 13:13.403
That's your job.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.728
Well, you know who I feel
the worst for is Charles.

13:15.880 --> 13:17.564
He'd rather you have a job.

13:17.720 --> 13:19.563
You know that's not true.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.602
"Happy Valentine's, Dawn."

13:25.760 --> 13:27.842
"Good-bye, Shirley."

13:30.600 --> 13:33.444
You look good. Rested.

13:33.600 --> 13:36.126
You said that.
How do I usually look?

13:36.280 --> 13:38.965
It's just that you've been so busy
for the last two years,

13:39.120 --> 13:40.929
you've never
taken me up for lunch.

13:41.080 --> 13:43.048
I figured you're on
some kind of break.

13:43.200 --> 13:45.441
Maybe I'm doing research.

13:45.600 --> 13:48.365
Maybe I want our place to be a little
bit more like Wells Rich Greene.

13:48.520 --> 13:50.648
You'd have to have Mary.

13:50.800 --> 13:53.201
And, you know,
you probably could.

13:53.360 --> 13:55.203
I knew you were gonna tell me
how great it is to work there,

13:55.360 --> 13:57.727
but I didn't think
that's where you'd start.

13:59.440 --> 14:02.125
So you looking
to make a change?

14:02.320 --> 14:03.810
I have a job.

14:03.960 --> 14:06.964
And I have a contract
and a noncompete clause.

14:07.120 --> 14:09.043
And I'm a partner.

14:10.440 --> 14:13.250
Look, I don't know what the truth is
and I don't really care.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.767
Someone said you were
dabbling in the LA office

14:15.920 --> 14:17.490
or managing your wife's career.

14:18.480 --> 14:19.720
People say things.

14:19.920 --> 14:22.366
Well, then you probably
heard the one

14:22.520 --> 14:26.650
where you pulled
a major boner in a meeting

14:26.840 --> 14:30.083
and you cried or punched
somebody or something

14:30.240 --> 14:32.811
and that they cut you loose.

14:34.280 --> 14:35.691
I didn't know I was
gonna be interrogated

14:35.840 --> 14:37.808
by the Hooterville
telephone operator.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.644
So it's not true?

14:39.800 --> 14:41.609
You're spoiling the mood.

14:43.840 --> 14:46.161
How about for a second date,
we go see the Knicks?

14:46.360 --> 14:47.725
Right on the floor.

14:47.880 --> 14:50.247
Bradley's having
one hell of a season.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.402
That's a good idea.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.206
Hello?

15:24.200 --> 15:25.440
Can I help you, sweetheart?

15:25.600 --> 15:27.648
Who are you?

15:27.800 --> 15:30.565
I'm Mr. Avery.
You looking for casting?

15:30.720 --> 15:34.167
No, I'm looking for my dad,
Donald Draper.

15:35.800 --> 15:39.407
Uh, well, he's not here.

15:40.880 --> 15:43.008
Did he change offices?

15:44.080 --> 15:46.686
Perfect.

15:46.880 --> 15:50.168
Look, honey, he's not here.

15:50.320 --> 15:52.891
He's probably at home.
You should call him.

15:53.040 --> 15:54.849
You know how to get
an outside line?

15:56.960 --> 15:58.485
Is Joan here?

15:58.680 --> 16:01.763
That's a good idea.
Her office is right down there.

16:11.440 --> 16:14.330
You know, I think
everybody's at lunch.

16:30.480 --> 16:32.482
Have a nice day.

16:44.360 --> 16:46.840
So she's sitting there
on the conference table

16:47.000 --> 16:49.128
Indian-style
in a dress and boots

16:49.320 --> 16:51.607
like some kind of perverted
kindergarten teacher

16:51.760 --> 16:54.969
and she says,
"Well, thank you, Robert.

16:55.120 --> 16:56.804
I know it's the best
you can do."

16:56.960 --> 16:59.008
What did Bob do?

16:59.200 --> 17:01.441
Accepted his death gracefully.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.602
I see a sheep and a wolf.

17:03.760 --> 17:05.569
But which is which?

17:05.720 --> 17:07.768
- How are you, Don?
- Great.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.930
Jim Hobart, Dave Wooster.

17:11.079 --> 17:12.161
We know each other.

17:12.319 --> 17:14.482
So, Dave, how come you'll have lunch
with Don and not with me?

17:14.640 --> 17:17.119
'Cause this is social.
He's not trying to buy us.

17:17.280 --> 17:19.601
Well, what are you
trying to do, Don?

17:19.760 --> 17:21.204
Are you taking lunches now?

17:21.359 --> 17:24.489
No, I'm just looking for love.

17:24.640 --> 17:26.563
Well, on behalf of myself

17:26.720 --> 17:28.848
and all the millionaires
at McCann Erickson,

17:29.000 --> 17:32.004
we'd love a chance to tell you
how handsome you are.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.845
Move along, Jim.

17:36.360 --> 17:40.285
Tell Mary I picked up the check,
because I just did.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.241
I don't have to crap
on McCann for you, do I?

17:44.400 --> 17:47.210
I almost worked there.
Twice.

17:47.360 --> 17:49.249
But you didn't.

18:07.240 --> 18:09.288
Here, I want you to have these.

18:09.480 --> 18:12.324
It smells like
an Italian funeral in there.

18:20.160 --> 18:22.003
So then dessert finally
arrives and the ladies,

18:22.200 --> 18:23.725
on cue,
depart to the toilets.

18:23.880 --> 18:26.406
And as we're standing,
Honeywell leans in and says,

18:26.560 --> 18:28.688
"I like what I see."

18:28.840 --> 18:32.208
Now, I thought he was making
a ribald comment about my date,

18:32.360 --> 18:34.089
but he followed up
by suggesting

18:34.240 --> 18:35.810
we retire to the bar,
just the two of us.

18:35.960 --> 18:38.042
Is this a partners' meeting

18:38.200 --> 18:42.046
or the most tedious
wireless program I've ever heard?

18:42.200 --> 18:44.680
What?

18:44.840 --> 18:46.171
What did he say?

18:46.320 --> 18:49.085
- We're on the edge of our seats.

18:49.240 --> 18:51.766
- Hello, New York?
- He's saying get to it, Pete.

18:51.920 --> 18:54.207
- Did you kiss the man or not?
- Fine.

18:54.400 --> 18:57.290
Well, he didn't want to say it
in front of the boys from Detroit,

18:57.440 --> 18:59.886
but he wants us
to handle his business.

19:00.040 --> 19:02.930
He rules the SoCal dealerships
with an iron fist.

19:03.120 --> 19:04.849
- That's great.
- Wonderful.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.480
- That's wonderful news.
- It is, isn't it?

19:07.640 --> 19:09.688
They want us to start
on the summer sale.

19:09.840 --> 19:11.171
Sign them right away.

19:11.320 --> 19:13.049
Sit in his yard with a pen
if you have to.

19:13.200 --> 19:14.440
Contract came
with the milkman.

19:14.600 --> 19:17.285
I'll get Bob Benson to fly in
from Detroit for the signing.

19:17.440 --> 19:19.442
We don't want the tail
wagging the dog.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.410
They're the Dealers Association.

19:22.560 --> 19:24.289
They bill almost
as much as Chevy does.

19:24.440 --> 19:25.680
They are the dog.

19:25.840 --> 19:27.683
- He's right.
- Just a minute.

19:27.840 --> 19:31.003
Chevy's our client
and they're our entree to GM,

19:31.160 --> 19:33.811
which bills more than
everything on the planet.

19:33.960 --> 19:35.928
I would tell Detroit
we've got this opportunity

19:36.080 --> 19:37.366
and I would ask
for their blessing.

19:37.520 --> 19:38.806
Look, when I brought in Chevy,

19:38.960 --> 19:40.928
I got their very own
Mikey O'Brien laid.

19:41.080 --> 19:43.845
Sorry, sweetheart.
And it wasn't easy. Sorry again.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.810
Pete caught him.
Let Pete mount him.

19:46.960 --> 19:48.724
Can we move on?

19:48.880 --> 19:51.804
This phone call is already
eating into our fee.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.287
Ted, weren't you there
when we signed Chevy?

19:54.440 --> 19:56.681
Roger seems to have failed
to get a head count.

19:56.880 --> 19:59.326
I don't see any reason
to keep score.

19:59.480 --> 20:02.165
Gentlemen,
this is good news.

20:02.320 --> 20:04.402
And I have no problem
with flying to Detroit

20:04.560 --> 20:07.131
and briefing Bob
and all those--

20:07.280 --> 20:09.681
I'll bring oranges.

20:09.840 --> 20:12.571
Ted? Are you there?

20:12.720 --> 20:14.324
Hello, California?

20:14.520 --> 20:16.966
- Dee, can you hear us?
- Yes, I can.

20:17.120 --> 20:20.044
Dee?

20:20.200 --> 20:22.680
What's wrong with you?
I say up, you say down.

20:22.840 --> 20:25.002
I'm surprised you're
disagreeing with me.

20:25.200 --> 20:26.770
It's common sense.

20:26.920 --> 20:28.490
I think they can't hear us.

20:28.640 --> 20:30.369
We can hear you!

20:30.520 --> 20:32.010
Pete can service the account,

20:32.160 --> 20:33.924
but he will report
to our man in Detroit

20:34.080 --> 20:36.447
where said parties
will be offered

20:36.600 --> 20:38.045
the right of refusal.

20:38.200 --> 20:41.010
I remember very clearly
when Don and I signed Chevy.

20:41.160 --> 20:42.207
Don who?

20:42.360 --> 20:45.284
Our collective ex-wife
who still receives alimony?

20:46.840 --> 20:48.444
- Hang up.
- No.

20:48.640 --> 20:49.926
This is a partners' meeting.

20:50.080 --> 20:51.320
Let's poll the partners,
shall we?

20:51.520 --> 20:53.409
- Aye.
- Aye what?

20:53.600 --> 20:55.045
I agree with Jim.

20:57.040 --> 20:59.008
Moira, fix the phone.

20:59.160 --> 21:01.162
I feel caught off guard
by having a confrontation

21:01.360 --> 21:03.681
over something
that seems rudimentary.

21:10.920 --> 21:12.922
They never said which
of Peggy's accounts we lost.

21:13.120 --> 21:15.407
Call me when you fix
the damn phone.

21:17.640 --> 21:19.688
Let me try out there.

21:19.880 --> 21:21.450
What difference could
that possibly make?

21:21.600 --> 21:23.170
I thought we were gonna
get a new one of these.

21:23.320 --> 21:25.004
And why the hell aren't
we in the conference room?

21:27.240 --> 21:29.925
Do not go after him.

21:32.200 --> 21:35.761
Moira, you can reach me
in my office.

21:42.440 --> 21:44.363
Hello?

21:44.520 --> 21:45.681
Marta?

21:45.840 --> 21:48.764
Oh, I looked
everywhere for you.

21:48.920 --> 21:50.649
What are you doing here?

21:50.800 --> 21:52.370
What happened?
ls everything okay?

21:52.520 --> 21:54.602
Obviously not.

21:54.760 --> 21:57.127
- Where were you?
- I was at the office.

21:57.280 --> 21:59.089
What?

21:59.240 --> 22:02.084
I wasn't feeling well.
I left early.

22:04.120 --> 22:05.326
What happened?

22:05.480 --> 22:06.641
Does your mother
know where you are?

22:06.840 --> 22:09.207
What? No.

22:09.360 --> 22:11.647
You're not supposed
to be off campus.

22:14.360 --> 22:17.807
My roommate's mother died
and they let us go to the funeral,

22:17.960 --> 22:20.167
but I lost my purse.

22:22.040 --> 22:25.442
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

22:26.440 --> 22:29.171
I just need money for the train.

22:32.320 --> 22:34.288
And I guess I need
a note of excuse.

22:34.440 --> 22:35.885
I'll drive you.

22:36.080 --> 22:39.926
No, it's okay.
You're not feeling well.

22:40.080 --> 22:41.730
I'll be fine.

22:41.920 --> 22:44.082
You really don't have to.

22:44.240 --> 22:46.288
It looks like you have
a lot of work to do.

22:46.440 --> 22:50.001
Come on, it'll be nice.
We'll take a drive.

22:50.160 --> 22:52.083
What's the note
supposed to say?

22:52.240 --> 22:53.446
What?

22:53.640 --> 22:56.291
Sally, what do I say?

22:58.000 --> 23:00.207
Just tell the truth.

23:10.480 --> 23:11.481
Where the hell were you?

23:11.640 --> 23:13.529
I was getting your perfume.

23:13.680 --> 23:16.524
- Draper's daughter showed up.
- Sally was here?

23:16.680 --> 23:18.682
I don't know her name.
She was looking for him.

23:18.840 --> 23:20.842
My Lord.
What did you say?

23:21.040 --> 23:23.805
I said he's probably at home.
It's not my problem.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.126
I have to call him.

23:25.280 --> 23:27.044
Call him?

23:27.200 --> 23:29.441
You have to call him?
Okay.

23:29.600 --> 23:32.331
Don't bother apologizing
to me, I guess.

23:33.720 --> 23:36.291
I'm very sorry.

23:38.560 --> 23:40.642
Want to go before we go?

23:40.800 --> 23:42.450
I'm fine.

23:44.880 --> 23:46.609
- Hello.
- It's Dawn.

23:46.760 --> 23:47.886
And I'm really sorry.

23:48.040 --> 23:49.405
I don't know what happened,

23:49.560 --> 23:52.131
but Sally came into the office
and she talked to Lou.

23:55.480 --> 23:57.687
- And what did he say?
- I don't know.

23:57.840 --> 24:01.128
But I wanted you to know
that she might be on her way.

24:01.280 --> 24:04.284
Okay.
Thank you, Dawn.

24:08.600 --> 24:10.011
Do you have to stay?

24:10.160 --> 24:12.527
No.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.204
Let's go.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.365
Hello, Dawn.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.766
Lou said he wanted to see me.

24:21.920 --> 24:23.968
Oh.

24:24.120 --> 24:26.600
Lou, Joan's here to see you.

24:26.760 --> 24:29.491
Actually, I need
to see the both of you.

24:40.440 --> 24:42.442
Get the door.

24:46.240 --> 24:48.481
When I generously agreed

24:48.640 --> 24:51.644
to share Dawn here
with Don Draper,

24:51.840 --> 24:53.922
it was for the purposes
of his correspondence

24:54.080 --> 24:57.448
and incoming phone calls,
not cleaning up his messes.

24:57.640 --> 25:00.450
One of those things
is very time-consuming.

25:00.640 --> 25:02.802
- What happened?
- His daughter came by.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.849
Why are we going
through all this?

25:05.000 --> 25:06.001
I know you can't fire her.

25:06.160 --> 25:07.810
Just move her to another part
of the building.

25:07.960 --> 25:10.088
Lou, I will take care of this.

25:10.240 --> 25:13.323
- What do you mean by that?
- I want my own girl.

25:13.480 --> 25:16.484
- Come along, Dawn.
- In a minute.

25:16.640 --> 25:19.041
Obviously I can say
anything I want.

25:19.240 --> 25:20.571
But you don't want to.

25:20.720 --> 25:23.849
I skipped my lunch
to buy your wife perfume.

25:24.880 --> 25:27.406
If you had been thoughtful
enough to get her a gift

25:27.560 --> 25:30.962
when I told you about it 10 days ago,
I would have been here.

25:31.120 --> 25:34.249
Do you understand?
It's not my problem.

25:34.400 --> 25:37.165
None of this has anything
to do with me.

25:39.240 --> 25:41.561
I'm sorry if I said
the wrong thing.

25:48.080 --> 25:49.605
Was that necessary?

25:49.760 --> 25:51.683
When she comes back
from the ladies',

25:51.840 --> 25:53.604
have her hand over the keys.

25:58.440 --> 25:59.805
New York is on the line.

25:59.960 --> 26:02.361
Do you have to put them
on the contraption?

26:02.520 --> 26:04.682
It's just Mr. Sterling.

26:07.040 --> 26:09.168
- This is Pete.
- It's Roger.

26:09.320 --> 26:11.527
I appreciate you fighting for me.

26:11.680 --> 26:13.967
Well, Jim pled his case

26:14.120 --> 26:16.168
and we decided it's best
to keep the business,

26:16.320 --> 26:18.209
but run it past Detroit.

26:18.360 --> 26:20.966
- Which means Bob gets involved.
- What?

26:21.120 --> 26:23.327
Jim and I had a meaningful
conversation--

26:23.480 --> 26:26.006
I heard your conversation.
You're full of it.

26:26.160 --> 26:27.321
That is just the kind of weakness

26:27.520 --> 26:29.124
that got us in this position
to begin with.

26:29.280 --> 26:31.851
Let me just go to Detroit.
I'm sure--

26:32.000 --> 26:34.480
...something to do with Bob
or my feelings towards Bob,

26:34.640 --> 26:35.721
but it really doesn't.

26:35.880 --> 26:38.611
It's a chance for me to rectify
my status with those people.

26:38.760 --> 26:41.491
And in the end, that's our
best route to new business.

26:41.640 --> 26:43.005
He disconnected.

26:49.720 --> 26:52.087
Why even bring in an account?

26:56.920 --> 26:59.241
They're just gonna take it away.

27:01.360 --> 27:03.124
Sometimes I think maybe I died

27:03.280 --> 27:05.248
and I'm in some kind of...

27:05.400 --> 27:08.529
I don't know if it's heaven
or hell or limbo.

27:08.680 --> 27:10.603
But I don't seem to exist.

27:10.760 --> 27:13.047
No one feels my existence.

27:13.200 --> 27:15.931
Just cash the checks.
You're gonna die one day.

27:16.080 --> 27:18.447
What you're supposed to say is,

27:18.600 --> 27:21.490
"Hey, why don't we just start
our own agency?"

27:21.640 --> 27:23.165
At least the goal would be clear.

27:23.320 --> 27:25.288
I mean, what am I
working for here?

27:25.440 --> 27:27.090
There's two offices.

27:27.240 --> 27:28.924
Yours is only slightly
better than mine.

27:29.120 --> 27:32.408
What am I supposed to do,
work my way up to your office?

27:32.560 --> 27:33.641
You can have my office.

27:33.800 --> 27:35.962
No, that is not the point.

27:38.800 --> 27:40.768
Cutler sent you out here
because you're too moral.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.888
He couldn't look you in
the face and be Machiavelli.

27:43.040 --> 27:44.280
That's not why I'm here.

27:44.440 --> 27:45.851
Why are you here?

27:46.000 --> 27:47.809
All you do is answer
the phone and mope around.

27:47.960 --> 27:49.803
You know what?

27:49.960 --> 27:51.530
We're not talking anymore.

27:51.680 --> 27:54.684
From now on, we'll both
pretend I'm in New York.

28:00.120 --> 28:03.010
Joan wants us to switch desks.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.401
Don't feel bad.
It's not your fault.

28:06.560 --> 28:07.971
I know.

28:08.160 --> 28:11.130
Don't be sore,
but I'm really happy.

28:12.120 --> 28:13.167
I need a box.

28:13.320 --> 28:15.527
She wants you
out front right now.

28:15.680 --> 28:19.844
Okay.
Well, just a few things.

28:20.840 --> 28:23.161
He takes it light
with two Sweet'N Lows.

28:23.320 --> 28:25.800
Always put through
his son Earl.

28:25.960 --> 28:27.689
These three lines are Lou's

28:27.840 --> 28:29.410
and this one is Mr. Draper's.

28:29.600 --> 28:32.206
Maybe I should get a pencil.

28:33.320 --> 28:34.446
You know what?

28:34.600 --> 28:37.843
I'll have Mr. Draper's calls
come straight to me at reception.

28:46.400 --> 28:47.526
"Elenore" playing

28:47.680 --> 28:52.208
♪ Elenore,
can I take the time ♪

28:52.360 --> 28:55.967
♪ To ask you
to speak your mind? ♪

28:56.120 --> 28:58.202
How old was
your friend's mother?

28:59.200 --> 29:01.202
She's not my friend.

29:01.360 --> 29:03.727
She's my roommate.

29:04.720 --> 29:06.051
Where was the funeral?

29:06.200 --> 29:08.362
81st and Madison.

29:08.520 --> 29:10.204
Where was she buried?

29:10.360 --> 29:14.126
In Queens by the racetrack.

29:14.280 --> 29:17.409
So you left your purse
at the cemetery?

29:17.560 --> 29:20.609
I'm not sure.
That's why it's lost.

29:22.120 --> 29:23.645
Why are you interrogating me?

29:23.800 --> 29:26.041
Because I know
you went to my office.

29:26.240 --> 29:29.050
So I find your story
a little suspicious.

29:29.240 --> 29:30.401
My story?

29:30.560 --> 29:32.085
There's some man in your office.

29:32.240 --> 29:34.481
- We're not talking about me.
- Did you lose your job?

29:34.640 --> 29:37.041
Why were you in the city?
I want to know this minute.

29:37.200 --> 29:39.487
I don't have to tell you anything.

29:39.640 --> 29:41.005
Just stop the car.

29:41.160 --> 29:43.811
- I'm talking to you.
- You're yelling at me.

29:43.960 --> 29:46.042
Why would you just let me
lie to you like that?

29:46.200 --> 29:49.170
Because it's more embarrassing
for me to catch you in a lie

29:49.320 --> 29:50.970
than it is for you to be lying.

29:51.120 --> 29:53.691
So you just laid in wait
like your mother?

29:55.000 --> 29:58.766
Do you know how hard it was
for me to go to your apartment?

29:58.920 --> 30:01.048
I could have run
into that woman.

30:02.560 --> 30:05.450
I could be in the elevator,
she could get in

30:05.600 --> 30:07.921
and I'd have
to stand there smiling

30:08.080 --> 30:11.129
wanting to vomit
while I smell her hairspray.

30:13.080 --> 30:18.450
♪ Elenore, gee,
I think you're swell... ♪

30:18.600 --> 30:20.284
I'm sorry.

30:20.440 --> 30:21.771

A chilly Valentine's evening to you.

30:35.600 --> 30:36.647
I have to get gas.

30:36.800 --> 30:38.802
The Los Angeles trial
of Sirhan Sirhan...

30:40.480 --> 30:43.324
I have Dee for you.

30:50.920 --> 30:52.809
Who the hell is Dee?

30:53.800 --> 30:55.484
From the Los Angeles office.

30:55.640 --> 30:57.768
She has Mr. Chaough
on the line.

30:57.960 --> 31:00.645
You've got to be kidding me.
Tell him I'm busy.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.802
Do you want me
to take a message?

31:03.000 --> 31:05.207
No, I want you
to leave a message.

31:05.360 --> 31:07.328
I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

31:07.480 --> 31:09.369
Tell her to tell Ted

31:09.520 --> 31:12.000
that I have no intention
of talking to him today.

31:12.160 --> 31:14.208
And that's it.
That's all I said.

31:14.360 --> 31:16.089
Okay.

31:20.040 --> 31:21.769
That's what she said.

31:25.760 --> 31:27.444
You know what, Shirley?

31:27.600 --> 31:30.285
I've been thinking about it
and I know it's silly,

31:30.440 --> 31:32.602
but could you please
throw these flowers away?

31:32.760 --> 31:34.000
Why?

31:34.200 --> 31:36.009
I'm sorry, but they're cursed.

31:36.200 --> 31:38.009
No, they're not.
They're beautiful.

31:38.160 --> 31:41.050
Look, I should have
bought you flowers

31:41.200 --> 31:43.521
out of respect,

31:43.680 --> 31:45.648
not because of some holiday.

31:47.440 --> 31:52.048
Are these some symbol
of how much we're loved?

31:52.200 --> 31:54.771
- It's a joke.
- Please, don't.

31:54.920 --> 31:55.967
I'll get you some new ones.

31:56.120 --> 31:58.726
Please, those are my flowers.

31:58.880 --> 32:00.370
They're from my fiancé.

32:00.560 --> 32:03.803
- Since when?
- Since this morning.

32:05.200 --> 32:06.565
Why didn't you tell me?

32:06.720 --> 32:08.006
You didn't give me a chance.

32:08.160 --> 32:10.242
I didn't give you a chance?

32:10.400 --> 32:13.768
They've been sitting
in there all day.

32:13.920 --> 32:16.651
- Now you're just embarrassing me.
- I didn't mean to.

32:16.800 --> 32:18.245
You know what?
You should have never told me.

32:18.400 --> 32:20.243
That would have been
a great gift.

32:20.400 --> 32:22.562
Who cares about
your stupid flowers?

32:22.720 --> 32:25.200
You have a ring on.
We all know that you're engaged.

32:25.360 --> 32:27.089
You did not have
to embarrass me.

32:27.240 --> 32:29.208
Grow up.

32:43.280 --> 32:45.681
10:00 a.m.?
Thank you.

32:52.880 --> 32:55.770
Come in.

32:57.640 --> 33:01.531
I just wanted to say
I was on my way to the club

33:01.680 --> 33:05.526
and I noticed there's been
a change in reception.

33:05.680 --> 33:07.125
I had to shuffle the girls.

33:07.280 --> 33:11.126
Well, I'm all for the national
advancement of colored people,

33:11.280 --> 33:14.124
but I do not believe
they should advance

33:14.280 --> 33:16.282
all the way to the front
of this office.

33:16.440 --> 33:19.887
People can see her
from the elevator.

33:20.040 --> 33:21.769
I'm sorry.

33:21.920 --> 33:24.366
Do you want me to dismiss her
based on the color of her skin?

33:24.560 --> 33:26.767
I said nothing of the kind.

33:26.920 --> 33:29.366
I'm merely suggesting
a rearrangement

33:29.520 --> 33:31.124
of your rearrangement.

33:31.320 --> 33:32.731
Suggesting?

33:32.880 --> 33:35.087
Requesting.

33:43.800 --> 33:45.325
Hello?

33:46.320 --> 33:48.641
- Bonnie?
- Pete?

33:50.040 --> 33:51.280
Hello, Valentine.

33:51.440 --> 33:54.046
What a pleasant surprise.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.929
Did you come to see me work?

33:56.080 --> 33:58.162
Because I wasn't
expecting you till 5:00.

33:58.320 --> 34:00.368
There's been a change of plans.

34:00.520 --> 34:02.602
You're going to be showing me
around your body

34:02.760 --> 34:04.762
at a bungalow
at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

34:04.920 --> 34:07.890
The devil and his temptations.

34:08.040 --> 34:10.610
I will be there at 5:15
unless I get an offer.

34:10.760 --> 34:12.649
You have an offer.

34:14.440 --> 34:15.965
I love my flowers.

34:16.120 --> 34:18.088
And I love you.

34:18.280 --> 34:21.409
But I also love the 15 strangers
who might buy this dump.

34:23.360 --> 34:25.647
Well, excuse me if I don't see
the point right now.

34:25.800 --> 34:28.565
I mean, I landed that whale
and New York just took it away.

34:28.719 --> 34:30.529
And I realized if the system's
rigged against me,

34:30.679 --> 34:32.125
I might as well enjoy myself.

34:34.560 --> 34:39.360
I once sold a house
for $108,000.

34:39.520 --> 34:43.127
Two weeks later, during escrow,
it burned down.

34:43.280 --> 34:47.045
I had driven this Okie couple
around for a year.

34:47.199 --> 34:49.168
Bought lunches,

34:49.320 --> 34:51.891
looked at pictures
of their hideous children.

34:52.040 --> 34:54.929
Do you know where Altadena is?

34:55.080 --> 34:56.969
Might as well be Barstow.

34:57.120 --> 34:59.441
I'd show up and have
to change my blouse

34:59.600 --> 35:02.922
because the sweat stains
were meeting between my breasts.

35:04.960 --> 35:07.725
I could have lived for months
on that commission.

35:07.880 --> 35:09.962
And then it was all gone

35:10.120 --> 35:12.600
because some asshole
barreling down Lake Avenue

35:12.760 --> 35:15.650
threw his cigarette
out the window.

35:15.840 --> 35:17.649
I'm sorry,
but it's not the same.

35:17.840 --> 35:21.208
It's worse.
I'm in sales, too.

35:21.360 --> 35:25.285
Not some housewife complaining
about getting oatmeal out of a carpet.

35:25.440 --> 35:28.808
An act of God, Pete,

35:28.960 --> 35:31.691
that's how you know
when things are really against you.

35:31.840 --> 35:34.047
You don't seem
very upset about it.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.850
'Cause that's the thrill.

35:36.000 --> 35:40.369
Our fortunes
are in other people's hands

35:40.520 --> 35:43.285
and we have to take them.

35:45.960 --> 35:49.248
I want to chew you up
and spit you out.

35:49.400 --> 35:52.404
Put the sign back.

36:04.920 --> 36:07.082

36:17.640 --> 36:18.971
You sure you don't want anything?

36:19.120 --> 36:21.361
I told you, I'm not hungry.

36:23.040 --> 36:24.280
How are your studies?

36:24.440 --> 36:26.124
Spectacular.

36:28.640 --> 36:30.210
Do you want a French fry?

36:34.480 --> 36:36.767
They're cold.

36:36.960 --> 36:38.689
Know what?
I'm gonna get some coffee.

36:43.560 --> 36:45.449
I should probably
call my friends.

36:45.640 --> 36:47.688
They're probably worried.

36:48.760 --> 36:50.649
Want ice cream or something?

36:50.800 --> 36:52.768
Did you even need gas?

36:52.920 --> 36:56.925
I wanted to talk to you.

37:05.680 --> 37:07.648
The reason I didn't tell you
I wasn't working

37:07.800 --> 37:09.848
was because I didn't
want anyone to know.

37:10.840 --> 37:12.365
Got it.

37:13.640 --> 37:16.325
I didn't behave well.

37:16.480 --> 37:18.369
I said the wrong things
to the wrong people

37:18.520 --> 37:20.409
at the wrong time.

37:20.560 --> 37:23.086
What did you say?

37:27.160 --> 37:29.367
I told the truth about myself.

37:30.600 --> 37:34.491
But it wasn't the right time... then.

37:34.640 --> 37:37.723
So they made me
take some time off and...

37:41.520 --> 37:43.807
I was ashamed.

37:46.200 --> 37:48.043
What was the truth?

37:48.240 --> 37:50.481
Nothing you don't know.

37:53.400 --> 37:55.164
So what are you gonna do?

37:55.320 --> 37:57.687
I don't know.

38:00.040 --> 38:02.088
It's kind of up to them.

38:05.520 --> 38:08.967
If you're not going to work,
why don't you stay with Megan?

38:10.640 --> 38:13.689
Because I wanted
to be here to fix it.

38:13.840 --> 38:17.162
How?

38:19.520 --> 38:21.443
I don't know.

38:23.400 --> 38:24.890
Do you still love Megan?

38:25.040 --> 38:26.769
Of course I do.

38:26.920 --> 38:28.490
You know I visit
every couple weeks.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.244
I talk to her all the time.

38:31.560 --> 38:34.848
Why don't you just tell her that you
don't want to move to California?

38:41.920 --> 38:43.684
Go ahead.

38:45.040 --> 38:47.611
- Can I get a Coke?
- Sure.

39:11.160 --> 39:13.811
- I'm sorry to bother you.
- What do you want, Peggy?

39:13.960 --> 39:17.009
Well, I'd like Shirley off my desk.

39:17.160 --> 39:19.606
What?
What did she do?

39:19.760 --> 39:22.206
There was an incident today

39:22.360 --> 39:24.647
and I'm not comfortable
with her on my desk.

39:24.840 --> 39:26.205
I shouldn't have to
tell you more than that.

39:26.360 --> 39:29.091
- So just fire her.
- I didn't say that.

39:29.240 --> 39:30.605
She can work anywhere
in the office you want.

39:30.800 --> 39:32.165
I just want someone else.

39:32.320 --> 39:33.765
Fine.

39:33.920 --> 39:36.685
- You can share Moira.
- She hates me.

39:36.840 --> 39:39.241
- Meredith.
- She has the mind of a child.

39:39.400 --> 39:41.323
Damn it, Peggy!

39:41.520 --> 39:42.806
Dawn can't work with Lou.

39:42.960 --> 39:44.689
Neither of them
can work out front.

39:44.840 --> 39:47.002
Scarlett and Harry
are practically married.

39:47.160 --> 39:49.288
- What do you want me to do?
- Fix it!

39:49.440 --> 39:51.442
All I know is that
today was a workday

39:51.600 --> 39:53.364
and I didn't get anything done.

39:56.920 --> 39:59.685
- What do you want?!
- I'm sorry.

39:59.840 --> 40:01.490
Since the meeting
was aborted,

40:01.640 --> 40:04.120
I wanted to get some details
regarding Avon.

40:04.280 --> 40:06.203
But perhaps now
is not a good time.

40:06.360 --> 40:08.886
We're just having
some personnel issues.

40:10.640 --> 40:12.608
I just realized

40:12.800 --> 40:14.962
you have two jobs,
don't you?

40:15.120 --> 40:18.886
- I'm not complaining.
- Maybe you should.

40:19.040 --> 40:20.804
What are the skills
required down here?

40:20.960 --> 40:22.371
Organization?
Fortitude?

40:22.560 --> 40:24.324
Lack of concern
for being unliked?

40:24.520 --> 40:27.330
I suppose.

40:28.720 --> 40:30.449
Well...

40:30.600 --> 40:33.251
there's an office open upstairs.

40:33.400 --> 40:37.166
It's for an account man,
not the head of personnel.

40:38.160 --> 40:39.207
What do you mean?

40:39.360 --> 40:41.408
Let me know what you decide.

40:41.560 --> 40:44.450
We can talk about
Avon on Monday.

40:44.600 --> 40:46.329
Good night.

40:50.200 --> 40:51.929
- Hello?
- It's me.

40:52.080 --> 40:53.844
Where the hell are you?

40:54.000 --> 40:55.525
We've got you covered
till lights out.

40:55.720 --> 40:57.165
Ankle Fat thinks
you're at a church somewhere

40:57.320 --> 40:58.651
with Sarah crying
on your shoulder.

40:58.800 --> 41:01.167
Thanks,
but I'm with my dad.

41:01.320 --> 41:02.810
He wrote me a note.

41:02.960 --> 41:05.201
You're never going to believe
what happened on the train.

41:05.400 --> 41:07.562
There was this creepy
salesman from Milford.

41:07.720 --> 41:10.200
He's really old,
but he keeps smiling at us

41:10.400 --> 41:12.448
and he wants to take us
to the smoker.

41:12.600 --> 41:15.444
- Yolanda said--
- You know what, Carol?

41:15.600 --> 41:18.809
- I should go.
- Well, we hid your booty.

41:18.960 --> 41:22.009
Your sandals, they're in the back
of the closet next to your cleats.

41:22.160 --> 41:24.367
So at least the trip
was worth it.

41:26.080 --> 41:28.321
I'll see you later.
Bye.

41:37.040 --> 41:38.849
What's this?

41:39.000 --> 41:40.445
I sot you a patty melt.

41:40.640 --> 41:42.404
Everything okay?

41:43.400 --> 41:44.925
Mm-hmm.

41:55.200 --> 41:57.407
I don't like
you going to funerals.

41:58.800 --> 42:01.087
It was awful.

42:01.240 --> 42:03.925
Sarah's mom was yellow.

42:04.120 --> 42:06.600
She was wearing this wig.

42:07.720 --> 42:09.529
I hate that you had to see that.

42:10.840 --> 42:13.002
I only went
so I could go shopping.

42:13.160 --> 42:14.685
I doubt that.

42:16.120 --> 42:18.122
I don't know.

42:20.680 --> 42:22.489
Life goes on.

42:25.240 --> 42:27.527
I'm so many people.

42:46.520 --> 42:48.090
Can you see the car from here?

42:49.680 --> 42:50.966
Yes.

42:51.120 --> 42:52.451
Good.

42:52.600 --> 42:54.204
I want you
to finish your meal.

42:54.360 --> 42:56.283
I'm gonna go out to the car
and get it running.

42:56.440 --> 42:58.204
Then you walk out.

43:00.200 --> 43:02.646
We're not gonna pay.

43:04.760 --> 43:06.762
Really?

43:30.600 --> 43:33.001
Don't bother with the flowers.
Everyone's gone.

43:33.160 --> 43:34.730
No, these are mine.

43:34.920 --> 43:37.526
They're from my son.
Thank you, Roger.

43:37.680 --> 43:40.889
Well, I bet he's gonna be pretty upset
if he sees you giving them away.

43:41.040 --> 43:42.405
I'm not.

43:42.560 --> 43:44.528
I'm taking them
to my new office.

43:44.720 --> 43:46.051
Up here?

43:46.200 --> 43:48.851
It was suggested that I move
now that I have some accounts.

43:49.000 --> 43:50.604
Jim suggested it?

43:50.760 --> 43:52.649
Do you disagree?

43:52.800 --> 43:54.928
Does it matter?

44:07.600 --> 44:10.080
Well, Rome wasn't built in a day.

44:43.200 --> 44:45.248
Ah, hello.

44:45.400 --> 44:47.289
Hello.

44:51.640 --> 44:55.008
Apparently we're going to finish
that conference call on Monday.

44:55.160 --> 44:57.242
That won't be necessary.

44:57.400 --> 44:59.289
I set Pete straight.

44:59.440 --> 45:01.841
Hmm, glad to hear it.

45:04.240 --> 45:07.449
I'd hate to think of you
as an adversary.

45:09.320 --> 45:11.687
I'd really hate that.

45:38.560 --> 45:40.244
You sure I don't have to go in
and talk to anyone?

45:40.400 --> 45:42.323
No, I have the note.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.970
Happy Valentine's Day.
I love you.
