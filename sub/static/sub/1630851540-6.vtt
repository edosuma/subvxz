00:06.000 --> 00:08.291
Hurry, come help us now!

00:09.000 --> 00:10.750
Help, my father just had a heart attack!

00:10.833 --> 00:13.333
-Aure, stop it. He's doing better now.
-Why are you being so loud.

00:13.416 --> 00:16.916
I'm fine sweetie, I just passed out,
that's all. I'm all right now.

00:17.958 --> 00:20.375
-Hello, help us, please!
-Aure, what's wrong with you?

00:20.458 --> 00:22.916
Come help us!

00:25.125 --> 00:27.750
-You're overreacting.
-Qué pasa aquí?

00:31.541 --> 00:32.541
Aure, no.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.791
Oh, my God, what is she doing?

00:35.875 --> 00:38.166
-Whoa!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey!

00:45.250 --> 00:47.541
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:58.208 --> 01:01.333
-Gosh, that's, uh…
-This is fun.

01:01.416 --> 01:02.875
Oh, it feels good

01:03.750 --> 01:06.833
Fuck, I better stop, otherwise I'm
gonna pussy fart. All right, enough.

01:06.916 --> 01:08.333
Help me! Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!

01:08.416 --> 01:10.291
She just took a
bullet in the shoulder, please!

01:10.375 --> 01:11.416
She's losing so much blood.

01:11.500 --> 01:12.958
-I'm begging you, save her.
-What?

01:13.041 --> 01:15.708
Wait a second, I mean, that's not
the plan. We weren't hired for this.

01:15.791 --> 01:16.958
Save her or take a bullet.

01:18.666 --> 01:21.000
-Yes, you can count on us.
-I can?

01:21.500 --> 01:23.041
However, Mr. Cavillan,

01:23.125 --> 01:25.583
I have to ask that you
leave the room since this requires

01:25.666 --> 01:27.000
a sterile environment.

01:27.583 --> 01:29.916
Well, I'm begging you guys.
Whatever it takes, just save her.

01:31.458 --> 01:32.291
Damn it.

01:33.875 --> 01:35.083
It's Catherine.

01:35.666 --> 01:36.583
Who's Catherine?

01:37.083 --> 01:40.000
-Pénélope and Catherine are the same?
-Well, yeah, it's Gérard's girlfriend.

01:40.083 --> 01:42.958
Well then, shit, she deserves this,
let me tell you, I hate this bitch.

01:43.041 --> 01:45.041
-We're not saving her.
-Excuse me, Dr. Ben Aflahak?

01:45.125 --> 01:47.000
What? She caused all this mess, remember?

01:47.083 --> 01:49.416
Did you not get the
meaning of the Hippocratic Oath.

01:49.500 --> 01:51.458
Listen, don't bring up Hippocrates

01:51.541 --> 01:53.791
-right now, because, I--
-I will respect every human being,

01:53.875 --> 01:55.583
their autonomy and free will,

01:55.666 --> 01:56.916
-without any discrimination
-Hey!

01:57.000 --> 01:58.666
-based on their beliefs or c--
-Yo, yo!

01:58.750 --> 02:00.541
There's no surgeon in here, all right?

02:00.625 --> 02:02.333
You're not a surgeon, I'm not a surgeon.

02:02.416 --> 02:04.333
You'll probably butcher her so don't try.

02:04.416 --> 02:07.833
You may not be aware, sir, that last year
I removed a malignant tumor on my cat.

02:07.916 --> 02:09.125
Nice, and then?

02:09.208 --> 02:11.416
Well, he died, during the surgery.

02:11.500 --> 02:15.125
That's what I'm saying, you're
not competent. God, your poor cat, Clem.

02:15.708 --> 02:18.833
Anyway, scissors.
Let's cut through her crop top.

02:22.500 --> 02:25.041
Here we go.
Sleep tight you son of a bitch.

02:25.125 --> 02:26.625
Fuck, well done, Aure.

02:26.708 --> 02:29.000
-Fuck, what just happened, Aure?
-How did you do that?

02:29.083 --> 02:31.166
Okay, let's bounce.

02:31.250 --> 02:34.541
-Yeah, let's go, Oh, oh, Aure?
-Yeah, yeah. Oh!

02:34.625 --> 02:36.000
-Um…
-What?

02:36.083 --> 02:38.208
-There's one more.
-What?

02:40.833 --> 02:42.041
All right, let's do this.

02:44.041 --> 02:45.375
Wow.

02:45.875 --> 02:47.625
-Whoa, whoa!
-Oh!

02:59.375 --> 03:00.458
-Take that!
-Yes!

03:00.541 --> 03:03.541
Alright, put me down, bro. You okay?

03:03.625 --> 03:04.541
Aure, can you breathe?

03:04.625 --> 03:06.125
Man, did you see how I kicked his ass?

03:06.208 --> 03:07.416
-You guys saw that, right?
-Yes.

03:07.500 --> 03:08.625
All right, come on, let's go.

03:08.708 --> 03:10.625
-Dad, come on, let's move it.
-Hold on guys,

03:11.125 --> 03:12.000
give me five minutes.

03:12.583 --> 03:16.875
My legs are like jelly.
My legs just can't move, I swear.

03:17.458 --> 03:18.958
Ah, fuck. I can't see shit.

03:19.666 --> 03:20.875
Retracting tissues.

03:20.958 --> 03:22.250
Go ahead, retract away.

03:22.333 --> 03:23.875
-Here we go.
-Going.

03:25.333 --> 03:27.416
Ah, fuck, I messed up.
I messed up, gauze pad.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.375
-What? Oh, gauze pad.
-Find a fucking gauze pad.

03:29.458 --> 03:30.833
-Hold on, gauze pad.
-Hurry up.

03:30.916 --> 03:33.333
God damn it, come on, don't be a sissy.

03:33.416 --> 03:34.833
Ah.

03:34.916 --> 03:36.791
Give me a break. Put your mask on.

03:36.875 --> 03:40.708
Oh sure. Oh crap, my earring.

03:40.791 --> 03:43.333
-What about your earring?
-Oh no, bummer, my earring.

03:43.416 --> 03:45.166
-Crap!
-Who gives a fuck about your earring,

03:45.250 --> 03:47.125
-seriously! What?
-Fuck it's in the wound.

03:47.208 --> 03:50.166
-I mean, oh. Oh.
-Oh, it's so wet.

03:50.916 --> 03:53.625
Oh, it's so soft. Feels so good in there.

03:54.583 --> 03:56.958
-Oh, it reminds me of Olivier.
-What?

03:57.458 --> 03:58.583
Ah, that's metal right there.

03:58.666 --> 04:01.166
-That's metal right there.
-That's metal, I found it. Found it.

04:01.250 --> 04:04.500
-This is great. Let me see.
-Oh, haha, come here. Here it is. Ha.

04:04.583 --> 04:06.625
Oh no, bummer, that's just the bullet.

04:06.708 --> 04:09.250
That's fucking amazing.
That's what we've been looking for.

04:09.333 --> 04:12.208
What, I don't care about the bullet.
I want my earring, man. Crap.

04:13.791 --> 04:16.541
Fuck, it's bleeding a lot now.
I'm gonna vacuum it up.

04:16.625 --> 04:18.416
-Hold on a sec. Hold on.
-I'll take care of it.

04:24.125 --> 04:26.541
That's enough.
That's it, that's it. Drink up.

04:26.625 --> 04:28.375
The whole thing.

04:29.333 --> 04:31.333
Ah!

04:31.416 --> 04:34.583
What are you doing? What the fuck!

04:34.666 --> 04:36.291
That's so fucking gross.

04:36.375 --> 04:38.583
-I got it.
-I don't give a fuck about your earring.

04:38.666 --> 04:40.333
Why did you spit on me?

04:40.416 --> 04:41.250
Ugh.

04:41.750 --> 04:44.791
-What the fuck.
-Didn't you practice sewing in prison?

04:44.875 --> 04:46.875
-Yeah, on Thursdays. Yeah.
-Oh yeah?

04:46.958 --> 04:49.333
So, please patch up this
little hole. I'll tie her to the bed.

04:49.416 --> 04:50.750
And then we'll go find the Hazans.

04:52.708 --> 04:54.125
All good. Come on.

04:56.666 --> 04:58.125
-God damn it, hurry up guys.
-Come on.

04:58.208 --> 05:00.791
Gimme a second all right.
I'm struggling with this mile-long toga.

05:00.875 --> 05:02.916
We're doing our best.
This fat pig weighs a ton.

05:04.125 --> 05:06.041
All clear. Go ahead, guys.

05:11.500 --> 05:14.250
Come on. We can do it.
Get down guys, quiet.

05:18.916 --> 05:20.041
Fuck, there's a guard here.

05:20.125 --> 05:21.208
-Really
-Shit.

05:22.750 --> 05:25.000
-How about we leave Dad here? Huh?
-What?

05:25.083 --> 05:26.708
Are you nuts?
He's not a sack of potatoes.

05:26.791 --> 05:28.750
No, but it's gonna be
even harder to carry him.

05:28.833 --> 05:31.500
That's not what I meant, here.
Let's put him in the closet, there.

05:31.583 --> 05:33.083
-Then we'll call for help.
-No way, Jo.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.666
I heard that. Don't you leave me here.

05:34.750 --> 05:37.375
-Shh.
-No, stop shouting dad, seriously.

05:37.458 --> 05:40.000
The guard just heard us.
We're gonna get caught.

05:41.583 --> 05:42.916
Olive, I need your watch.

05:45.250 --> 05:46.250
7:12 man.

05:46.333 --> 05:47.166
I don't give a shit.

05:47.250 --> 05:49.250
-I just need your fucking watch.
-What are you doing?

05:49.333 --> 05:50.166
Come on, come on.

05:50.791 --> 05:52.750
Careful with it. What do you need it for?

05:53.750 --> 05:54.875
-Jo, wait, Jo.
-No!

05:54.958 --> 05:57.208
Gosh no, bro.

05:58.500 --> 05:59.333
He's moving.

06:02.500 --> 06:04.583
He's moving, moving, moving. Moving.

06:08.875 --> 06:11.041
-Yes!
-Go, go, go, go, go.

06:11.125 --> 06:12.791
All right, all right.

06:12.875 --> 06:13.833
-Okay.
-Come on Dad.

06:13.916 --> 06:15.791
-I'm fine, I can walk
-Hurry up, guys.

06:30.208 --> 06:32.250
Motherfucker, they're not here.

06:32.333 --> 06:33.458
Damn it, they escaped.

06:34.625 --> 06:36.583
Honestly, they tied 'em up pretty good.

06:36.666 --> 06:38.958
-Come on. Let's bounce.
-Yeah.

06:41.291 --> 06:42.833
God Jo, that was fucked up.

06:42.916 --> 06:44.625
I got that watch for my Bar Mitzvah, man.

06:44.708 --> 06:46.958
It's a limited edition.
It cost a nut now, you know.

06:47.041 --> 06:49.458
Bro, enough, we now know
exactly how much a nut is worth,

06:49.541 --> 06:51.375
and it's not 140 bucks
like your crappy Festina.

06:51.458 --> 06:52.625
No, but I loved that watch.

06:52.708 --> 06:53.708
Let's go.

06:54.208 --> 06:55.583
Look, the red Jeep is right here.

06:55.666 --> 06:57.666
Right here, right here.

06:58.833 --> 07:00.833
Smash in the
left rear door, it's unlocked.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.416
Oh, my God, it's open. It worked.

07:03.916 --> 07:06.041
Oh, I can't believe it.

07:08.458 --> 07:09.583
Jo, what's wrong?

07:10.166 --> 07:11.625
She actually was trying to help us.

07:11.708 --> 07:14.333
-What?
-Catherine. We gotta go get her,

07:14.416 --> 07:15.583
we can't leave her behind.

07:15.666 --> 07:17.041
Yeah, we have to. You're right Jo.

07:17.125 --> 07:18.666
No, don't even think about it.

07:18.750 --> 07:20.916
-I'm not traveling with that kabah.
-Dad, c'mon, stop it.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.208
Ollie, you start the car.
We'll be back in five minutes.

07:23.291 --> 07:24.541
What do you mean, start the car?

07:24.625 --> 07:25.958
We'll be right back.

07:26.041 --> 07:27.500
-Just do it.
-Do you have the keys.

07:27.583 --> 07:29.375
How can I make that happen?

07:41.541 --> 07:42.583
All clear.

07:53.541 --> 07:54.625
-Watch out, watch out.
-What?

07:54.708 --> 07:57.083
Come here, there are guards, hurry.
Let's hide in here.

08:05.916 --> 08:06.916
Let's go.

08:12.375 --> 08:13.375
All clear.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.166
-They're approaching.
-What should we do?

08:17.958 --> 08:19.250
Here. Take this.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.000
Why'd you hand me this?
You want me to read right now?

08:23.083 --> 08:24.000
Hit them.

08:35.541 --> 08:37.458
You, me…

08:41.500 --> 08:42.333
that way.

08:43.958 --> 08:44.958
What?

08:50.958 --> 08:51.791
What?

08:57.083 --> 08:58.625
What's taking them so long?

09:00.541 --> 09:02.208
They're saying something
I don't understand.

09:03.708 --> 09:04.625
Did they move?

09:15.083 --> 09:19.333
Hey holy man, how's that
brick tasting? Like cheese?

09:20.416 --> 09:23.666
-What?
-As in brick cheese. It's a pun.

09:24.500 --> 09:25.791
-Get it?
-Oh, got it.

09:25.875 --> 09:27.708
-We used to love that.
-Best cheese ever.

09:27.791 --> 09:30.291
Remember how Mom
would always get it for us?

09:33.083 --> 09:34.375
Gosh, our mom.

09:36.791 --> 09:38.916
-Come on.
-Yeah, now's not the time. Let's go.

09:49.500 --> 09:50.375
Wait.

09:56.875 --> 09:58.500
Oh, shit, she's alive. Come on.

09:59.125 --> 10:01.666
Guards, please hold on.
I'm so sorry. Let me explain…

10:01.750 --> 10:03.875
Don't worry Catherine,
you're leaving with us.

10:03.958 --> 10:07.833
Oh, thank you. Uh, uh.
I'm so sorry about this.

10:07.916 --> 10:10.375
-He is my son but he's a monster.
-We'll talk about this later.

10:10.458 --> 10:12.625
Catherine, I also want to
apologize for not trusting you,

10:12.708 --> 10:15.583
but since you've been weird since
day one and you put us in this mess--

10:15.666 --> 10:17.041
Okay, we'll talk about it later.

10:17.125 --> 10:18.708
-Ah, sure.
-We really gotta go.

10:18.791 --> 10:20.166
-We gotta go.
-We'll talk later.

10:20.250 --> 10:22.458
But I can't. I'm naked.

10:23.083 --> 10:24.541
It doesn't bother me, but…

10:25.541 --> 10:28.291
I mean just-- How about you wear my pants,
I'll give you my pants.

10:28.375 --> 10:29.625
Oh, yes, that's a great idea.

10:30.125 --> 10:33.250
-All right, get up. You okay?
-All right, here we go.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.541
-Oh, I'm sorry
-I'll get this off.

10:35.625 --> 10:36.958
Oh, here it is. Okay, almost done.

10:37.041 --> 10:38.916
-Hurry, Jo. Please, come on.
-Yeah, I'm on it.

10:39.416 --> 10:41.416
My shoe came off. Here you go.

10:41.916 --> 10:44.000
All right, this is for you. Take this.

10:44.083 --> 10:45.000
Thank you.

10:45.083 --> 10:47.083
I know, I just got an idea for a top, Jo.

10:48.916 --> 10:52.041
What are you doing?

10:52.125 --> 10:52.958
What are you doing?

10:53.041 --> 10:56.500
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, whoa.

10:56.583 --> 10:59.166
What the heck is going on?
Hey, what are you doing?

10:59.666 --> 11:03.000
Are you kidding me? You made me--
You just made me a mini toga skirt.

11:03.083 --> 11:05.708
You look great, it's fancy.
We'll talk about it later, we gotta go.

11:05.791 --> 11:07.041
Here, take this.

11:07.541 --> 11:09.666
Oh, wait, there's a coat here, actually.

11:09.750 --> 11:11.083
Are you fucking kidding me?

11:11.791 --> 11:14.541
That's great. So, now I'm walking
around with my balls out for nothing.

11:14.625 --> 11:18.458
Great, you left the back door open,
shit, bunghole breeze.

11:19.375 --> 11:20.666
Why is it not working?

11:29.208 --> 11:30.833
Why the fuck did you do that?

11:30.916 --> 11:32.333
Turn it off! Right now!

11:32.416 --> 11:35.125
Calm the fuck down.
I don't know how to start a car.

11:35.208 --> 11:36.625
I never had a dad to teach me.

11:39.458 --> 11:42.208
Damn it. If my father was here,
it'd be much easier.

11:42.291 --> 11:44.375
Oh, your father this,
your father that, enough.

11:44.458 --> 11:45.708
He might have been an imbecile.

11:45.791 --> 11:48.291
Probably didn't know how to
steal a car either, your father.

11:50.458 --> 11:52.958
There you go, son. Good job.

11:53.041 --> 11:55.583
-I love it when you believe in yourself.
-Go, go, go.

11:55.666 --> 11:57.333
-Go, go!
-Let's go, let's go.

11:57.416 --> 11:59.541
No, I said no. If she's here
just leave without me.

11:59.625 --> 12:01.625
We're down for the count, we gotta go.

12:01.708 --> 12:02.833
Go, go!

12:07.958 --> 12:09.916
Where's that fucking gate? There it is.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.666
Over here, over here.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.500
Come on, faster!

12:19.916 --> 12:20.916
Hit hard.

12:27.500 --> 12:28.416
What was that?

12:29.791 --> 12:31.125
What was that noise?

12:31.208 --> 12:33.250
That was from the ropes
we placed on the guards' cars.

12:33.333 --> 12:35.791
No way. All right.

12:36.833 --> 12:39.000
We managed to
get these bastards after all.

12:41.708 --> 12:42.791
He got me pretty good, too.

12:44.750 --> 12:46.916
Hey, they're escaping, Miguel! Miguel!

12:47.791 --> 12:49.708
Miguel! Miguel!

12:55.958 --> 12:57.250
Hurry up.

12:57.333 --> 12:58.208
Come on.

13:00.333 --> 13:01.333
It's not budging.

13:02.458 --> 13:04.541
-Back off, back off.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

13:05.291 --> 13:07.291
Wait, fuck.

13:08.416 --> 13:09.666
It's simple, the gate is locked.

13:09.750 --> 13:11.375
No shit, Dad. We're all aware of that.

13:11.458 --> 13:12.458
Jo, what's the plan?

13:16.500 --> 13:18.041
-Oh, my God.
-They're shooting!

13:18.125 --> 13:21.666
-Take cover guys, we gotta hide.
-We need to go this way.

13:23.041 --> 13:24.458
Follow me, guys. This way.

13:25.041 --> 13:26.125
Watch-- Where you are going?

13:32.791 --> 13:34.500
Where are they?
Where the fuck did they go?

13:34.583 --> 13:36.916
Don't worry, Aure.
We'll meet them at the other fence.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Okay.

13:40.458 --> 13:42.541
-You all right? You okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

13:45.541 --> 13:47.500
Please don't kill us,
we surrender. Please.

13:48.125 --> 13:49.500
Please don't kill me.

13:50.083 --> 13:51.583
C'mon, stop shitting your pants, dude.

13:52.666 --> 13:55.583
Come give a kiss
to Uncle Youssef.

13:55.666 --> 13:58.708
Holy shit, oh, fuck, Youssef!

13:58.791 --> 14:00.583
-Haha, Youssef!
-Clémentine?

14:00.666 --> 14:03.041
-Oh, haha, you alright?
-What are you doing here?

14:03.125 --> 14:05.125
We came to rescue you guys.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.250
Oh no.

14:11.916 --> 14:13.208
Oh, they're so cute.

14:19.541 --> 14:20.541
All right, guys.

14:21.166 --> 14:22.708
All right, enough.

14:24.541 --> 14:25.458
We should get going.

14:26.083 --> 14:28.666
-Olive? Olive!
-Okay, that's enough for now.

14:28.750 --> 14:31.041
-Hey, Olivier, we gotta go!
-Huh? What?

14:31.125 --> 14:33.125
-We really need to go now.
-Uh, yeah, of course.

14:33.208 --> 14:35.916
Yeah. Let's go, let's go, moving.
Keep it moving.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.583
He kissed me, did you notice?

14:37.666 --> 14:39.250
We all noticed. Come on.

14:41.166 --> 14:42.375
-This way.
-Yeah.

14:46.625 --> 14:47.875
Hello Mom.

14:48.541 --> 14:50.125
You had a fast recovery, didn't you?

14:50.625 --> 14:54.416
Hold on, my love, calm down.
Calm down, this is not what it looks like.

14:54.500 --> 14:58.000
Yeah right, why should I believe you?
It's time to slaughter you one by one.

14:59.291 --> 15:04.000
Léonard, Léonard you're about to make a
huge mistake. You're gonna ruin your life.

15:04.083 --> 15:06.708
I'm gonna ruin my life, huh?
So, now you give a shit about me?

15:06.791 --> 15:09.333
No, you'd just rather be
with that wrinkled old fart, right?

15:09.416 --> 15:11.625
Hey, I've got great
skin for a guy in his 70s.

15:11.708 --> 15:13.000
Shut up. Fuck you, old dog.

15:13.916 --> 15:15.625
Why don't you
shut up Dad, he's got a point.

15:15.708 --> 15:16.666
Léonard, look at me,

15:17.875 --> 15:20.458
that's nonsense. My family is you.

15:22.458 --> 15:24.833
Not assholes like
Gérard and his stupid son.

15:26.583 --> 15:29.791
So stop right now. You nearly killed me.

15:31.125 --> 15:35.625
All I want for us now is to be
back in business together like we used to.

15:35.708 --> 15:37.750
This ain't like we used to.
This has to change.

15:38.333 --> 15:40.166
You heard him, Catherine,
he wants to change.…

15:40.250 --> 15:43.583
Shut the fuck up or I'll lodge a bullet
in your noodle and you'll be mute, dude.

15:44.208 --> 15:45.625
Yeah, shut up.

15:46.791 --> 15:49.083
You think I don't know
you're the reason they're escaping?

15:49.583 --> 15:51.625
-You think I'm blind?
-Stop it, Léonard,

15:51.708 --> 15:53.250
can't you see that I'm using them?

15:53.333 --> 15:55.000
Yeah, but-- What?

15:55.083 --> 15:56.833
Otherwise, they'd be long gone.

15:57.541 --> 15:59.125
I'm on your side, son.

15:59.708 --> 16:00.791
I'm on your side.

16:01.666 --> 16:04.916
-Is that true?
-Yes, of course, it's true.

16:06.125 --> 16:08.708
I love you. I do.

16:12.041 --> 16:16.958
Me too, Mom. But I, I don't know.
I'm so sorry, I can't control myself.

16:17.041 --> 16:17.958
Come here.

16:18.458 --> 16:21.500
I'm so sorry, Mom. I'm not well.

16:23.625 --> 16:24.833
I'm so sorry.

16:25.791 --> 16:28.041
I'm so sorry, Mom.
I love you. Forgive me, Mom.

16:28.125 --> 16:29.375
I love you, Mom.

16:29.958 --> 16:31.208
I love you, my love.

16:31.291 --> 16:34.166
I'll try to be better.
I'll try not to be an asshole anymore.

16:38.958 --> 16:40.666
Wait. No, no.

16:41.166 --> 16:42.666
I have no other choice.

16:42.750 --> 16:44.625
-Are you serious?
-I'm sorry, son.

16:46.250 --> 16:47.375
I'm really sorry.

16:48.583 --> 16:49.666
Tie him up.

16:51.083 --> 16:52.083
H-- Hey, ho.

16:52.166 --> 16:54.583
-What?
-Come back, we need to tie him up!

16:54.666 --> 16:56.416
-Yeah, sure, sure.
-Well, you know, Catherine,

16:56.916 --> 16:59.541
with all this back
and forth and back and forth,

16:59.625 --> 17:02.750
well, it's been very confusing.
I, I didn't know what to expect.

17:03.250 --> 17:05.291
-We got it--
-That's right. Honestly, it wasn't clear,

17:05.375 --> 17:07.666
-we thought you were trying to screw us.
-Let's tie him up.

17:07.750 --> 17:09.666
Anyway,
all right, let's tie him up.

17:10.500 --> 17:13.625
-God damn it, I can't do it!
-Ollie, what are you doing?

17:13.708 --> 17:16.083
-I'm trying to open this.
-You've been trying for ten minutes.

17:16.166 --> 17:18.625
It's a lock, what can I do about it?
I can't melt this shit?

17:18.708 --> 17:20.833
And where the fuck are the others?
I mean, seriously.

17:20.916 --> 17:22.708
-Ollie, here we are.
-Look, it's Jo.

17:22.791 --> 17:24.458
-Oh great.
-Family!

17:24.541 --> 17:26.666
Shh, what the heck?
What are you guys doing here?

17:26.750 --> 17:28.750
Guess what, we came to rescue you guys.

17:28.833 --> 17:31.375
-Nice chicken legs, bro. Looking good.
-Gimme a break.

17:31.458 --> 17:33.625
Whoa, that fucking liar
is not coming with us.

17:33.708 --> 17:35.916
-Hey, hey, Youssef, Youssef.
-No way, I don't give a fuck.

17:36.500 --> 17:38.708
She just saved our lives, all right.
She's coming with us.

17:41.916 --> 17:43.375
Let's go, we've gotta hurry.

17:43.458 --> 17:45.208
No, no, no, wait! We can't leave yet.

17:45.291 --> 17:46.291
We forgot Grandma.

17:46.375 --> 17:48.208
No, she's no longer with us.

17:49.208 --> 17:51.333
Bingo! She has passed.

17:51.416 --> 17:54.041
You owe me twelve bucks.
I told you she wouldn't make it to winter.

17:54.125 --> 17:56.041
She did not bite the dust,
she's just not here.

17:57.791 --> 17:59.625
Well, save them anyway,
it's only mid-February.

17:59.708 --> 18:02.166
You're out of your mind.
Ludmilla is one tough cookie.

18:05.208 --> 18:07.791
We need to reach Fonza Point.
There's a boat waiting for us there.

18:07.875 --> 18:10.750
Okay, then we have to go this
way, so they don't catch up to us.

18:16.375 --> 18:18.458
Fuck, we're really in Corsica.

18:30.291 --> 18:31.125
Youssef?

18:31.708 --> 18:34.000
What are we doing now?
Are we gonna rescue Grandma?

18:34.083 --> 18:34.958
Yeah.

18:35.041 --> 18:37.833
Now we're set on
auto-pilot towards Algeria.

18:37.916 --> 18:39.666
-Algeria?
-We'll get some rest in Constantine,

18:39.750 --> 18:41.541
and there we'll work on mission Ludmila.

18:41.625 --> 18:43.041
Awesome. Great idea.

18:43.541 --> 18:45.000
I really, really thank you, brother.

18:45.083 --> 18:46.833
-Thank you so much, you've been a,
-Yeah, man.

18:46.916 --> 18:48.916
you've been a world-class hero, honestly.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.583
What's wrong with you? You're my blood,
my brother-in-law, family.

18:51.666 --> 18:54.083
Listen, the one you guys
gotta be thankful for is Clémentine.

18:54.166 --> 18:56.166
-Oh, shut up, no way.
-Yes, yes they do. Come on.

18:56.250 --> 18:58.583
Yeah, 'cause under her
little bougie style is a psycho.

18:58.666 --> 19:00.583
Real gangster, I'm telling you.

19:00.666 --> 19:02.916
Give it up for Clémentine

19:03.000 --> 19:04.500
-Great job, Clem.
-Great work, my love.

19:04.583 --> 19:05.541
You really came through.

19:05.625 --> 19:06.458
Thank you.

19:06.541 --> 19:09.000
Thank you, little gangster.

19:09.083 --> 19:11.041
No, no, but thank you.

19:12.541 --> 19:15.000
I have to admit that doing
all of this has taught me a lot,

19:17.458 --> 19:22.583
which gave me a few ideas for the future.
But……shh!

19:22.666 --> 19:25.041
I will keep my lips sealed. Zip, whoop…

19:25.791 --> 19:28.166
Ploop, oh no! Baah!

19:28.250 --> 19:29.208
Okay.

19:29.291 --> 19:31.250
-Awesome.
-I'm drowning, I'm drowning.

19:31.750 --> 19:35.375
Okay, we didn't really get what you
meant but that sounds awesome, well done.

19:35.458 --> 19:38.541
-Bravo.
-Absolutely no sense. Well done, my love.

19:40.333 --> 19:42.541
Getting out
of there 'cause of you.

19:53.625 --> 19:54.791
I'm sorry.

19:56.625 --> 19:59.583
We are gathered here
together on this night,

20:00.416 --> 20:03.000
well, first because we're not dead, right?

20:03.750 --> 20:06.000
We really could have
all died in, in Corsica,

20:06.083 --> 20:08.291
let's not, let's not forget about that.

20:08.375 --> 20:11.333
But, we're here now to celebrate

20:11.833 --> 20:15.541
and join this man and
this woman, this wonderful couple,

20:16.791 --> 20:17.791
Gérard

20:19.000 --> 20:19.833
and Catherine…

20:20.416 --> 20:23.166
-Pénélope, in fact.
-Ah.

20:23.250 --> 20:24.666
My real name is Pénélope.

20:25.250 --> 20:26.250
-Really?
-Yes.

20:26.333 --> 20:29.208
-Pénélope Cavillan. Yes.
-You serious?

20:31.208 --> 20:32.958
I like that name, Pénélope.

20:33.875 --> 20:36.000
My Péné.

20:36.083 --> 20:37.875
My sweet Péné.

20:38.458 --> 20:41.458
I don't think that nickname's really
gonna work, Dad, don't you agree?

20:41.541 --> 20:43.458
-Why not?
-Péné kind of sounds like penis.

20:43.541 --> 20:47.375
Yeah, Dad, I agree with Aure. So, uh,

20:47.458 --> 20:50.416
-Pénélope, I am delighted
-Mm?

20:50.500 --> 20:54.208
to welcome you now as a
new member of the Hazan family.

20:55.250 --> 20:56.375
We gotta…

20:57.541 --> 20:58.833
well, we gotta admit,

20:58.916 --> 21:01.958
we really started off on the,
on the wrong foot, right?

21:02.041 --> 21:04.250
-Right.
-But never mind, that's all behind us.

21:04.333 --> 21:06.541
I honestly prefer to look to the future,

21:07.666 --> 21:09.250
because that's part of being a family.

21:10.458 --> 21:12.333
Family can change, you know?

21:15.375 --> 21:16.500
Can evolve.

21:18.416 --> 21:19.416
It can grow.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.375
But it's still a family.

21:24.916 --> 21:26.250
And that's the beauty of it.

21:29.333 --> 21:31.375
-Gérard.
-Yes.

21:31.458 --> 21:32.291
Péné,

21:33.833 --> 21:34.875
alla vodka,

21:34.958 --> 21:36.708
it's always delicious.

21:37.500 --> 21:39.958
You may choose your witnesses.

21:40.041 --> 21:41.458
I choose Aure.

21:44.666 --> 21:47.375
I'm getting emotional.
Thank you, that's very sweet.

21:47.458 --> 21:48.500
Excellent choice.

21:49.083 --> 21:52.416
-You pop, your witness.
-Yes, I know, I know.

21:52.916 --> 21:54.416
Well, I choose my son.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.708
That's complicated,
Dad, because I'm the rabbi,

21:57.791 --> 22:00.291
the captain of the boat,
unfortunately, I can't do anything--

22:00.375 --> 22:02.958
Yeah, I know, I know Joseph.
No, no, but, I…

22:03.041 --> 22:04.125
…meant to say…

22:07.708 --> 22:09.166
I meant to say Olivier.

22:09.750 --> 22:11.291
Hmm? Me?

22:12.291 --> 22:13.791
Well, Olivier, there…

22:15.041 --> 22:17.791
there's something
I never told you,

22:18.708 --> 22:20.583
because, actually, I, I,

22:20.666 --> 22:23.583
-I didn't have the courage.
-That's okay, Gérard,

22:23.666 --> 22:25.166
It's fine,

22:27.166 --> 22:28.208
I already know.

22:28.291 --> 22:31.750
Oh, damn it. You had to
spill the beans, right?

22:31.833 --> 22:34.083
-You son of an idiot.
-It was me.

22:34.166 --> 22:36.125
Well, duh, of course
it was you that told him.

22:37.125 --> 22:38.291
I told him, yeah.

22:38.375 --> 22:40.875
Well, Olivier, uh, listen, uh,

22:40.958 --> 22:43.500
well, I'm sorry I lied to you,

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
all these years.

22:45.708 --> 22:48.833
And, besides, I bet you're
quite disappointed, right?

22:52.750 --> 22:54.208
Why do you say that?

22:54.791 --> 22:57.958
-Well, you know.
-Gérard, I was right.

22:59.791 --> 23:01.625
I always knew my father was a

23:02.541 --> 23:03.583
bandito,

23:04.916 --> 23:05.916
a renegade,

23:07.875 --> 23:08.916
Casanova,

23:10.333 --> 23:11.583
a good man.

23:16.291 --> 23:17.125
He's my son.

23:19.333 --> 23:20.625
Classy, brother, classy.

23:21.750 --> 23:25.708
Aure, we're sisters-in-law.

23:26.291 --> 23:30.333
-My boy. Mm-hmm?
-What? Dad?

23:31.375 --> 23:32.958
When you say, "He's my son,"

23:33.958 --> 23:35.791
do you mean your real son?

23:36.666 --> 23:39.208
Well, uh, yes, I mean my real son.
Really?

23:40.958 --> 23:42.083
Okay.

23:42.166 --> 23:44.416
-He's your brother.
-He's my brother.

23:46.750 --> 23:48.541
-That's right.
-What's with that face?

23:48.625 --> 23:50.833
-He's your brother. That's wonderful.
-Oh, yeah.

23:50.916 --> 23:52.875
-It's Ollie, that's great.
-Of course,

23:52.958 --> 23:55.583
-I get seasick, that's why I'm--
-You should be happy, it's Ollie.

23:55.666 --> 23:57.541
-Waves make me seasick!
-C'mon, give him a hug.

23:57.625 --> 23:59.625
-Hug your sister.
-Why do I need to tell you that?

23:59.708 --> 24:01.458
All right, then, let's do it.

24:03.083 --> 24:04.666
-I can't believe it.
-I felt the same way.

24:04.750 --> 24:07.083
-Don't hug me too tight, all right?
-Yeah, right. Darn.

24:07.958 --> 24:12.500
All right, we have to celebrate our
new brother just a little later, for now,

24:13.083 --> 24:15.541
let's return to the highlight of our show.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.125
If anyone wishes to object to this union

24:20.708 --> 24:22.500
-he or she shall speak now--
-Me!

24:22.583 --> 24:24.333
-No, come on Clem,
-Not now.

24:24.416 --> 24:26.916
let me finish, or forever hold your peace.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.875
-Forever hold your peace.
-I'm kidding.

24:28.958 --> 24:31.708
Right, great one. No, bad one, actually.

24:31.791 --> 24:33.833
-Sorry, guys.
-Yeah, she better be kidding, really.

24:33.916 --> 24:35.333
Such a pain in the ass.

24:35.416 --> 24:37.958
Get ready guys, for the main event.

24:38.958 --> 24:39.791
Gérard

24:40.666 --> 24:42.000
Mordecaï

24:42.083 --> 24:43.083
Hazan,

24:44.208 --> 24:47.291
do you take this
woman to be your wife? Uh,

24:48.000 --> 24:51.333
Catherine Pénélope
Cavillan, standing here?

24:52.500 --> 24:53.333
I do.

24:57.041 --> 25:00.750
Pénélope, uh, Catherine Cavillan,

25:01.250 --> 25:03.500
do you take this stud to be your husband,

25:04.875 --> 25:06.958
Gérard Mordecaï,

25:07.041 --> 25:08.541
aka "the old Camel"…

25:08.625 --> 25:09.875
Enough with that.

25:09.958 --> 25:12.250
I'm sorry, I just couldn't resist.

25:12.333 --> 25:13.916
…Hazan, standing here?

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
I do.

25:17.166 --> 25:19.791
Well then, by the power vested in me

25:20.291 --> 25:22.958
by this hat,
this captain's hat that I treasure,

25:23.458 --> 25:27.708
I now pronounce you both,
husband and wife, forever.

25:27.791 --> 25:30.333
Dad, you may kiss the bride.

25:30.416 --> 25:32.666
-I'll do that right now.
-Do it.

25:34.666 --> 25:35.750
All right!

25:47.666 --> 25:48.500
Love you, Dad.

25:49.083 --> 25:50.625
Molotov!

25:51.291 --> 25:53.750
Hey, my love, we say "mazel tov,"
not "molotov."

25:53.833 --> 25:57.500
Yes, yes. Molotov, let's go!

25:57.583 --> 25:59.125
What, the fuck.

25:59.208 --> 26:02.500
-Oh, my gosh. What the hell?
-What are you--

26:02.583 --> 26:04.458
No, no, stay calm guys

26:04.541 --> 26:07.125
it's just a little fire.
It's all under control.

26:07.208 --> 26:09.375
No, no, Joseph, no running on the boat!

26:09.458 --> 26:11.541
Stop it, you're gonna slip, Joseph!

26:12.041 --> 26:15.208
Oh, why are you throwing a bucket
of water? Now you're gonna--

26:15.291 --> 26:16.625
Aah, holy shit!

26:16.708 --> 26:18.291
It's getting out of control.

26:18.375 --> 26:19.708
Youssef, help--

26:19.791 --> 26:21.458
Wait, don't jump in the water.

26:21.541 --> 26:23.666
Don't jump, you might get hypothermia.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.250
What, are you guys out of your minds?

26:25.333 --> 26:27.541
Stop!

26:42.083 --> 26:47.791
2 MONTHS LATER

27:51.166 --> 27:52.541
Thank you, Enrico.

27:54.125 --> 27:56.458
I thank you for
playing and singing their song.

27:58.208 --> 27:59.750
And where they are now,

28:01.041 --> 28:03.375
I'm sure they enjoyed it very much.

28:11.416 --> 28:12.666
My bubbelehs…

28:14.958 --> 28:16.875
we did lots of stupid things.

28:18.916 --> 28:22.083
But even on this
saddest of my entire life,

28:24.041 --> 28:25.458
I don't regret a thing

28:26.375 --> 28:28.250
because we did this all together,

28:29.125 --> 28:30.375
as a family.

28:32.083 --> 28:35.333
Up until the brave
SWAT team came to rescue me

28:36.291 --> 28:37.666
I was able to go

28:38.416 --> 28:39.500
every single day,

28:40.083 --> 28:41.416
thanks to you all.

28:42.875 --> 28:44.208
I love you, my babies.

28:45.291 --> 28:47.291
I will love you forever,

28:47.375 --> 28:48.375
you are my home.

29:07.375 --> 29:10.333
It'll be all right,
sweetie, it'll be fine.

29:12.541 --> 29:14.000
I still can't believe it.

29:15.666 --> 29:17.291
May I borrow her for a second?

29:18.333 --> 29:19.291
Come with me.

29:19.916 --> 29:22.000
-Take the kids.
-I'll be right back.

29:36.958 --> 29:40.750
Come, Aïda. Let me introduce you to
an old friend of mine, meet Rabbi Kaufman.

29:40.833 --> 29:42.125
Thank you, Ludmila.

29:42.791 --> 29:45.958
Young lady, I'm
extremely sorry for your loss.

29:46.791 --> 29:47.791
Thank you.

29:47.875 --> 29:49.375
You know, Joseph,

29:49.458 --> 29:51.625
Joseph was an amazing man.

29:52.208 --> 29:53.125
Yes, he was.

29:53.208 --> 29:55.625
Really, a, a, a
brilliant scholar, very hands--

29:55.708 --> 29:59.291
No, no, Aïda, Aïda, don't cry, my love.
Don't, don't cry, it's me.

30:00.666 --> 30:02.916
-Joseph?
-Yes, yes, my love, it's me.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.291
-This can't be real.
-It is.

30:05.375 --> 30:07.416
No, no, no, don't cry.
Stop this, stop this.

30:07.500 --> 30:10.791
Oh, oh, my God, dear child.
Oh, my God, come here.

30:11.291 --> 30:13.916
Hey, hey kiddos. How are
you my loves? Daddy's alive.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.541
-Daddy's alive.
-They're all alive.

30:15.625 --> 30:18.125
If I could take you in my arms
and kiss you, I'd do it right now.

30:18.208 --> 30:19.083
Daddy's not dead.

30:19.166 --> 30:20.250
-Joseph.
-Yes.

30:20.333 --> 30:22.666
-There's police everywhere.
-I know.

30:22.750 --> 30:23.916
I'll leave you two alone.

30:24.583 --> 30:26.208
-All right.
-I'll be waiting out front.

30:26.291 --> 30:28.458
Goodbye, Ludmila. Goodbye, kiddos.

30:28.541 --> 30:30.791
See you later, cute little donuts.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.583
And is everyone else alive, too?

30:39.500 --> 30:41.500
Come on, Ollie,
tell us, what are they doing?

30:41.583 --> 30:43.333
What, it seems to be going great.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.375
They're chit-chatting.
She's touching his hand.

30:46.458 --> 30:49.166
His hand? Ah, she's such a prude.
She should give him a hand job.

30:49.250 --> 30:51.333
What's wrong with you?
Don't talk about Aïda like that.

30:51.416 --> 30:53.875
Wait, why not? How do you
think they had triplets, huh?

30:53.958 --> 30:56.916
Speaking of, I don't even get to
see my grandchildren. What a bummer.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.458
-Will you ever stop complaining?
-It's ridiculous.

30:59.541 --> 31:01.833
Don't you think I'd
also love to see my grandma?

31:01.916 --> 31:04.875
Don't worry, Dad. They'll come visit us
in Thailand once things settle.

31:04.958 --> 31:07.833
I spoke with my contact.
Our fake passports are almost ready.

31:07.916 --> 31:09.708
We'll be all set to leave next week.

31:09.791 --> 31:12.916
-Yes, I know, but I still miss them.
-Yeah, we all do.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.625
It was close but everyone's alive.

31:14.708 --> 31:17.125
-Your brother's alive. Hey, hello.
-Hello.

31:17.208 --> 31:18.541
-Excuse me, Rabbi?
-Yes?

31:18.625 --> 31:20.791
We're one person short to
have minyan, if you don't mind.

31:20.875 --> 31:24.958
Oy, yoy, yoy, the minyan.
Always the, the minyan, everywhere.

31:25.041 --> 31:29.000
Unfortunately, I can't because I'm with
this young lady and we're leaving now.

31:29.083 --> 31:30.958
Wait, Rabbi, we need you.
We need to be ten,

31:31.041 --> 31:34.041
-and without you, we'd be nine, not ten.
-Yes, I know. Unfortunately, I can't.

31:34.125 --> 31:35.583
Listen. I just can't, unfortunately.

31:35.666 --> 31:38.291
Stop busting my balls, you're
unbelievable, I just told you I can't.

31:38.375 --> 31:40.166
Damn, why don't you understand?

31:40.250 --> 31:42.125
C'mon, get lost before I
whack you with my stick.

31:42.208 --> 31:44.500
Get the fuck out of here,
Goddammit. Get lost, Goddammit.

31:44.583 --> 31:47.708
Go away, young man, you thief, thief.

31:48.208 --> 31:51.291
He just tried to touch my private parts.

31:55.291 --> 31:57.791
-Where are you all hiding?
-Huh?

31:58.791 --> 32:00.041
I, I can't tell you right now.

32:00.541 --> 32:02.541
I just can't. I don't
want you guys to be in danger.

32:03.041 --> 32:05.916
Let's take a walk, all right.
'Cause I feel like we're being watched.

32:06.958 --> 32:08.583
But, uh, hold on, I don't get it.

32:08.666 --> 32:10.500
The explosion on the boat,
was that bullshit?

32:10.583 --> 32:12.791
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, that really happened.

32:12.875 --> 32:15.416
-How'd you guys survive?
-Look, I'm gonna tell you everything.

32:15.500 --> 32:17.291
All right, it was crazy.

32:17.375 --> 32:20.541
Listen, what happened was,
Clémentine, she came up with this plan.

32:20.625 --> 32:23.458
She was gonna pretend that
we were all dead, but she didn't warn us

32:23.541 --> 32:26.333
when she threw the
Molotov cocktail, so we all panicked.

32:26.416 --> 32:28.333
And trust me,
the flames were, like, everywhere,

32:28.416 --> 32:30.708
the boat was on fire.
It was like, it was like Crème brûlée…
