Goddamn it, Cheryl,

00:18.552 --> 00:20.364
are you gonna shoot
this goddamn thing or what?

00:20.388 --> 00:24.092
Well, it's hard for me
to make a decision

00:24.125 --> 00:26.360
without knowing
what this "or what" option is.

00:26.394 --> 00:27.761
Duh.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.463
For God's sakes, Lana,

00:29.563 --> 00:33.234
do you literally
want to become lunch?

00:33.267 --> 00:34.711
The gas pedal
is the one on the right.

00:34.735 --> 00:37.938
I'm trying.
I can't get any power.

00:37.971 --> 00:40.608
Why are these guns
so freaking loud?

00:40.641 --> 00:43.043
My earballs are on fire!

00:44.778 --> 00:46.414
Shoot him in the dick!

00:46.447 --> 00:47.748
Space snails

00:47.781 --> 00:49.317
don't have dicks.

00:49.417 --> 00:50.460
Technically, they have both

00:50.484 --> 00:52.220
male and female
reproductive organs,

00:52.253 --> 00:54.422
so they can inseminate
and be inseminated.

00:54.455 --> 00:56.557
Cyril's definitely been
to those kind of parties.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.226
- Space burn.
- Would you idiots

00:58.259 --> 01:00.728
mind focusing
on the problem at hand, please?

01:00.761 --> 01:04.063
Krieger, why can't I get
any power from the boosters?

01:04.098 --> 01:06.834
What the hell is going on
with the power supply?

01:06.934 --> 01:08.169
Goddamn it!

01:08.269 --> 01:09.913
Something must be
depleting power from the ship.

01:09.937 --> 01:11.939
Did someone leave the fan on
in the bathroom again?

01:11.972 --> 01:14.007
- Not me.
- And why not?

01:14.108 --> 01:16.777
What is with all the banging
and the shouting?

01:16.810 --> 01:18.812
Are we hosting a quinceañera?

01:23.016 --> 01:26.254
Oh, shit!

01:28.156 --> 01:30.324
No!

01:31.659 --> 01:34.295
I left my purse in there!

01:36.000 --> 01:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:17.171 --> 02:20.308
- That was awesome.
- Awesome?

02:20.341 --> 02:21.842
We're stuck inside
a space nautilus

02:21.875 --> 02:23.844
somewhere between his colon
and his cloaca.

02:23.877 --> 02:25.413
What's a cloaca?

02:25.513 --> 02:27.248
It's an organ that's used
for excretion

02:27.348 --> 02:28.482
and also intercourse.

02:28.516 --> 02:29.683
Smart.

02:29.717 --> 02:31.252
Pam, shut up.

02:31.352 --> 02:33.029
You know, for the person
who got us into this mess,

02:33.053 --> 02:35.689
you certainly are yelling
at people a lot.

02:35.723 --> 02:38.001
- You got us into this mess.
- Hey, let's not point fingers.

02:38.025 --> 02:39.860
Especially yours, Lana.

02:39.893 --> 02:41.238
Those things are like
cricket bats.

02:41.262 --> 02:42.996
You're the one
who wouldn't listen to me

02:43.030 --> 02:44.498
and set our course for a galaxy

02:44.532 --> 02:46.676
to which we've never been
before, and, as we can now see,

02:46.700 --> 02:49.737
is a ship-eating
cosmo crustacean.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.905
Well, you were the one
making the flight super boring,

02:51.939 --> 02:53.407
so I started punching
colored buttons

02:53.441 --> 02:55.042
on the navigation panel,

02:55.075 --> 02:58.712
building to a loud,
yelly, final last point!

02:58.746 --> 03:00.714
Can we please figure out
how the hell

03:00.748 --> 03:02.015
we're getting out of here?

03:02.049 --> 03:03.227
- Yeah!
- We are totally boned.

03:03.251 --> 03:04.785
Would everyone relax. We'll just

03:04.885 --> 03:06.620
fire up the old plasma torch,

03:06.720 --> 03:09.957
cut an ulcer in this thing,
and zorp our way out of here.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.796
Okay. Don't waste
any more power.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.231
It'll work.

03:17.265 --> 03:19.099
No, it will not.

03:19.132 --> 03:20.468
Well, not with that attitude.

03:20.568 --> 03:21.969
That wasn't me, idiot.

03:22.069 --> 03:24.272
- I tried that, too, when I got here.
- Wha...

03:24.305 --> 03:26.274
Can't you go anywhere these days

03:26.307 --> 03:28.809
without being accosted
by the homeless?

03:28.909 --> 03:31.579
Um, so I guess I'll just
wait out here, then,

03:31.612 --> 03:33.547
like some space-flunky.

03:36.817 --> 03:39.653
This is so stupid.

03:39.753 --> 03:41.221
"Lead us into battle, Cheryl."

03:41.255 --> 03:43.424
"Rescue the ship
from certain doom, Carol."

03:43.457 --> 03:46.994
Who am I, Artemisia I of Caria?

03:49.763 --> 03:52.433
You know what I mean.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.570
Oh, God!

03:56.604 --> 03:57.605
Is it... a human?

03:57.638 --> 03:59.607
Of sorts.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.442
Smells like
a diaper's coffin in here.

04:01.475 --> 04:04.077
This is why
you don't invite them in.

04:04.111 --> 04:06.079
- She's a vampire?
- Everyone shut up.

04:06.113 --> 04:08.449
Who are you
and what are you doing here?

04:08.482 --> 04:10.017
My name is Glenda Price,

04:10.117 --> 04:12.653
captain of the starship
Tristan of Coralia.

04:15.022 --> 04:17.458
I also commanded
the CoreStart mission.

04:17.491 --> 04:18.826
Wrote a book about it.

04:18.858 --> 04:20.861
Space Me, Space You.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.164
About all the good we did

04:24.197 --> 04:26.534
and the lives we saved
throughout the universe?

04:26.634 --> 04:29.470
The cover art is my
Intergalactic Peace Prize medal?

04:29.503 --> 04:30.614
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, I remember that.
- I love Space Me, Space You.

04:30.638 --> 04:31.648
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, space.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.474
Anyway, the Tristan was on

04:33.507 --> 04:35.476
an intergalactic
humanitarian mission

04:35.509 --> 04:37.177
when we ran into the Zarglorp.

04:37.210 --> 04:38.812
What's the Zarglorp?

04:38.846 --> 04:40.113
- Seriously?
- Come on!

04:40.147 --> 04:42.049
Even I know that was stupid.

04:42.149 --> 04:43.851
The creature that ate us, dummy.

04:43.884 --> 04:46.520
- Jesus, all right, sorry.
- We were delivering

04:46.554 --> 04:49.957
medical supplies to poor
children and burn victims

04:49.990 --> 04:52.893
when an asteroid storm
forced us off course

04:52.993 --> 04:54.728
into the Targluk Galaxy.

04:54.828 --> 04:56.864
Is that how
you all ended up there?

04:56.897 --> 04:58.399
Uh... uh, y-yup.

04:58.499 --> 04:59.733
Asteroid storm.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.502
Size of eggs.

05:01.535 --> 05:04.705
Ah, yes. We got dragged in
and swallowed whole.

05:04.738 --> 05:08.008
The Tristan is still wedged
nearby in the digestive canal.

05:08.041 --> 05:10.978
- And your crew?
- Oh, we made do at first.

05:11.011 --> 05:13.847
We played softball,
taught ourselves piano.

05:13.881 --> 05:16.417
But then the rations ran out
and, one by one,

05:16.517 --> 05:18.051
they killed themselves.

05:18.085 --> 05:19.420
- Wow.
- Cheesy Petes.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.154
Captain, I am so sorry
to hear that.

05:21.188 --> 05:24.425
Me too. We lived in our own
little utopia.

05:26.059 --> 05:28.662
They were my best friends.

05:28.696 --> 05:31.164
Best friends?
But they work for you.

05:31.198 --> 05:34.001
Anyhow, then, as they died,
we'd eat them.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.503
Smart.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.438
Unfortunately,
there's no way out of here.

05:37.538 --> 05:40.441
We'll slowly be digested over
the next hundred years or so.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.676
A hundred years?
That's, like, forever.

05:42.710 --> 05:45.112
- Nobody lives that long, idiot.
- You definitely won't

05:45.212 --> 05:46.880
if you don't
keep your mouth shut.

05:48.782 --> 05:51.194
All right, calm down. We aren't
spending the rest of our lives

05:51.218 --> 05:54.522
in some space prawn's shit
factory. Krieger, figure out

05:54.555 --> 05:56.624
why there's no power
to the boosters and fix it.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.025
- Yep, yep, yep.
- Ray,

05:58.058 --> 05:59.793
fix anything
damaged in the crash.

05:59.893 --> 06:02.195
Pam, Lana, and I will go back
to the Tristan

06:02.229 --> 06:04.565
and collect anything that might
help us get out of here.

06:04.598 --> 06:07.100
Cyril, I guess
just keep being useless.

06:07.134 --> 06:08.636
- Captain?
- What do you need?

06:08.736 --> 06:10.471
I want to help you all
get to safety,

06:10.571 --> 06:12.540
like when I rescued
the Vantaurians

06:12.573 --> 06:14.775
from that ELE on Vantaur Five,

06:14.808 --> 06:16.977
then used all my money

06:17.077 --> 06:19.813
to get them all
universal health care.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.214
That's insurance
that is accepted

06:21.248 --> 06:22.450
throughout the universe.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.818
Wow, what a goddamn saint
you are.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.620
Do you have any blast charges
on your ship?

06:26.654 --> 06:28.789
Yes, but do not use them,
because...

06:28.822 --> 06:30.824
Great.
Okay, Pam, this is crucial.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.736
Once we're out there,
look for anything we can use

06:32.760 --> 06:34.495
to make me a drink.

06:34.595 --> 06:37.565
We're in the middle
of a space creature's stomach.

06:37.598 --> 06:40.267
There's always something
that can be a mixer, Lana.

06:40.300 --> 06:42.570
I made a drink once
out of Barbicide and hair gel.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.638
It's called a Moscow Mousse.

06:44.672 --> 06:46.006
Well, it seems like you all

06:46.106 --> 06:47.741
have this situation
under control.

06:47.775 --> 06:50.511
Under control?
We're currently food.

06:50.611 --> 06:51.745
Well, you know me.

06:51.779 --> 06:54.081
Always "glass half full."

06:54.114 --> 06:56.917
♪ Ta-ta.

07:00.454 --> 07:02.756
Okay, pro: All my stuff
is on board,

07:02.790 --> 07:04.191
including that kick-ass purse

07:04.291 --> 07:05.693
that has metal studs
on the bottom

07:05.793 --> 07:07.928
so it doesn't touch
gross restaurant floors.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.631
Con.
I'm gonna have to keep doing

07:10.664 --> 07:12.704
stupid fighter pilot missions,
and they're so boring

07:12.800 --> 07:14.702
'cause I'm so good.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.103
Pro: I'm here.

07:16.136 --> 07:18.606
Is that you, voice in my head?

07:18.639 --> 07:21.374
You sound so much older.
And drunker.

07:21.475 --> 07:23.477
Look at the screen,
you glue-eating pinhead.

07:23.511 --> 07:26.313
Oh! I've seen this show!
With the mean lady!

07:26.346 --> 07:28.882
- Um... Matlock!
- Listen to me.

07:28.982 --> 07:32.452
We have to fly down
into that monster this instant.

07:32.486 --> 07:34.221
For my purse? I know, right?

07:34.321 --> 07:36.323
It matches literally everything.

07:36.356 --> 07:38.492
No, you clod.
To pick up Sterling,

07:38.526 --> 07:40.227
then get the hell out of here.

07:40.327 --> 07:41.895
Mm, no, thanks.

07:41.995 --> 07:44.131
What do you mean, "No, thanks"?

07:44.164 --> 07:45.799
I'm probably
just better off leaving

07:45.833 --> 07:47.234
and starting a new life.

07:47.334 --> 07:48.636
Hey, you want to come?

07:48.669 --> 07:50.704
- Gals' trip!
- Absolutely not!

07:50.738 --> 07:53.373
Now listen to me. We are
flying back down there and...

07:53.406 --> 07:56.143
You're not my space supervisor!

08:00.648 --> 08:02.816
All right, Cyril,
while we're gone,

08:02.850 --> 08:04.518
keep Captain Price company.

08:04.552 --> 08:05.853
She's been through a lot.

08:05.886 --> 08:07.755
Maybe you'll learn
a thing or two from her.

08:07.855 --> 08:09.365
Oh, from the woman
who got her ship eaten

08:09.389 --> 08:10.858
and her whole crew killed?

08:10.891 --> 08:13.060
That's still more than you've
ever accomplished, Cyril.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.094
Keep her company.

08:16.229 --> 08:18.365
Cyril, right? Come over here.

08:18.398 --> 08:21.268
Sit down. Let's have a chat,
just you and I.

08:21.368 --> 08:23.403
Would you like to hear the story

08:23.436 --> 08:25.405
of how I saved
the Drang population

08:25.438 --> 08:27.107
after the Great Flood
of the Mupak Valley?

08:27.207 --> 08:30.210
You know what? Yes, I would.

08:30.243 --> 08:31.679
Screw it,
if we're dying in here,

08:31.712 --> 08:33.547
I'm gonna go ahead
and finish that cake.

08:33.581 --> 08:35.582
I mean, I don't even care.

08:38.451 --> 08:40.563
- Krieger?
- Still looking for the source of the power loss.

08:40.587 --> 08:43.190
Seems like it's been
getting sucked all night.

08:43.222 --> 08:45.425
Space phrasing.
All right, find it and fix it.

08:45.458 --> 08:47.027
Once this thing pukes us out,

08:47.060 --> 08:49.930
we're gonna need those boosters
to get out of this galaxy.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.969
Don't worry, my child.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.971
Daddy's here.

08:58.071 --> 09:00.373
More...

09:00.407 --> 09:03.143
power.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.922
What was that bullshit
back there with Cyril?

09:14.955 --> 09:16.556
"Keep Captain Price company"?

09:16.590 --> 09:18.826
Since when do you care
about other people's feelings?

09:18.926 --> 09:21.128
Well, unlike you, Lana,
I have empathy.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.263
Oh, wait. Uh, sympathy?

09:23.296 --> 09:24.665
I think it's "symphony."

09:24.765 --> 09:26.834
I can put myself
in Price's shoes, okay?

09:26.934 --> 09:28.802
I know I'm gonna be
the last survivor,

09:28.836 --> 09:30.638
resorting to cannibalism.

09:30.671 --> 09:33.841
Stuck here to die alone,
literally eating dicks.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.275
Oh, come on.

09:35.308 --> 09:36.844
Or, you know, whatever Pam has.

09:36.944 --> 09:38.445
I hesitate
to call that thing a dick.

09:38.478 --> 09:40.347
It's more like a garbage claw.

09:40.447 --> 09:41.749
Oh, pfft. Give me a break.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.150
You don't want to die alone?

09:43.183 --> 09:45.185
You were always gonna die alone.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.020
What's that supposed to mean?

09:47.120 --> 09:48.656
Archer, be honest.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.634
You're not close to anyone
because you don't care.

09:50.658 --> 09:52.660
You don't even bother
to listen to people,

09:52.693 --> 09:53.761
especially me.

09:53.794 --> 09:55.162
That's not true, Lana.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.864
I just listened
to that entire sentence,

09:56.964 --> 09:58.531
and it was excruciating.

09:58.632 --> 10:00.167
Up top.

10:01.969 --> 10:04.504
Holy shitsnacks.

10:04.537 --> 10:06.373
These must be
the suicidal crew members.

10:06.473 --> 10:07.941
Price was talking about.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.510
Uh, you ever hear about
someone committing suicide

10:10.543 --> 10:12.680
by bludgeoning themselves
in the back of the head?

10:12.713 --> 10:14.982
Hey, the blast charges!

10:15.015 --> 10:16.950
Weren't you listening
when Price said

10:16.984 --> 10:18.819
not to set those charges off?

10:18.852 --> 10:20.654
I actually wasn't.
What did she say?

10:20.688 --> 10:21.955
Not to.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.824
Don't make things worse
than they already are.

10:23.857 --> 10:26.326
Worse?
We're in a monster's colon.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.628
We'll be safe here
behind this big fleshy...

10:28.662 --> 10:30.297
What is this, a tumor?

10:30.330 --> 10:32.365
Aw, poor guy.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.709
Okay, now get back to the ship.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.476
Hey, what's that?

10:43.510 --> 10:46.814
Ugh. Some sort of parasites

10:46.847 --> 10:49.049
that live in this thing's
digestive system.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.818
Yeah, I get those sometimes

10:50.851 --> 10:52.485
if I've been
nosing through the trash.

10:52.519 --> 10:54.387
Ugh.

10:54.421 --> 10:55.756
Remember me saying
something about

10:55.856 --> 10:57.324
not wanting things to get worse?

10:57.357 --> 11:00.093
I actually was listening then.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.662
Will you shut up
and help me think of a plan?

11:02.696 --> 11:04.364
She said, while both talking

11:04.397 --> 11:06.399
and not coming up with a plan.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.568
Archer... Wait.
I just came up with a plan.

11:08.601 --> 11:10.070
It's kind of complex.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.338
Run!

11:16.043 --> 11:18.746
I sliced the Florglap
right in his face

11:18.779 --> 11:20.447
and I never looked back.

11:20.547 --> 11:22.182
And because of my heroism,

11:22.215 --> 11:24.584
they made a holiday in my honor.

11:24.617 --> 11:27.120
I mean, not a bank holiday,
but still.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.556
Wow, what a rewarding life.

11:29.589 --> 11:31.524
So, tell me
about your life, Cyril.

11:31.558 --> 11:32.926
Oh, me?

11:32.960 --> 11:34.603
I've had a rough go of it.
You don't want to hear it.

11:34.627 --> 11:37.197
Son, nothing matters to me more.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.566
A captain cares about her crew
more than herself.

11:39.599 --> 11:41.234
That's the captain's code.

11:41.268 --> 11:44.805
Well, okay,
if it's the captain's code.

11:44.905 --> 11:47.875
Uh, I guess it all started
when I was about five.

11:47.908 --> 11:50.277
I never wanted
to be a fighter pilot.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.579
I wanted to work in fashion.

11:52.612 --> 11:54.147
Wouldn't that be a sight to see?

11:54.247 --> 11:56.416
Totally. You see these outfits
we're wearing, right?

11:56.449 --> 11:57.918
Who came up with this?

11:57.951 --> 12:00.153
Does anybody's ass look good
in a flight suit?

12:00.253 --> 12:01.755
- No!
- Well, you know,

12:01.789 --> 12:04.624
I have some friends
in the design world.

12:04.657 --> 12:08.428
Hey! I just had a great idea.

12:08.461 --> 12:12.065
- You know what we should do?
- Yes! We should rob them!

12:12.099 --> 12:13.934
No! We should fly down

12:13.967 --> 12:16.236
into that monster
to get Sterling, then...

12:16.269 --> 12:19.006
I love it!
You and me can be space pirates!

12:19.106 --> 12:21.842
With my fighter pilot skills
and your "zerp-zerp" thing,

12:21.942 --> 12:24.244
we could run this galaxy!

12:24.277 --> 12:27.280
Ooh, let's plan
our pirate outfits!

12:27.314 --> 12:29.082
And it turns out

12:29.116 --> 12:31.184
everyone did know
it was my birthday

12:31.284 --> 12:34.021
and they skipped it
just to hurt my feelings.

12:34.121 --> 12:37.490
To this day, I've never got
to play spin the bottle!

12:37.524 --> 12:41.461
Wow. Life, she is a bitch.

12:41.494 --> 12:42.963
But you know what people say?

12:42.996 --> 12:44.664
When things seem darkest...

12:44.697 --> 12:46.666
What, Captain?

12:46.699 --> 12:48.368
Kill yourself.

12:51.504 --> 12:53.473
Oh, my dear boy,

12:53.506 --> 12:54.808
look at you.

12:54.842 --> 12:57.544
You're an exact replica of me.

12:57.644 --> 13:00.013
Though that hairline
could use a little work.

13:00.047 --> 13:03.150
M-more power!

13:03.183 --> 13:06.887
- Shh, okay, okay.
- More, more, more...

13:16.663 --> 13:18.165
Oh, no, I've killed him!

13:18.198 --> 13:20.633
Oh, God, no!

13:20.667 --> 13:22.702
Son, I didn't mean to kill you.

13:22.735 --> 13:25.472
M-murder!

13:25.505 --> 13:27.841
- Murderer!
- No, no, shh!

13:27.875 --> 13:30.186
- Murderer! Murderer!
- No, no, shut up, shut up. No, no, no, you're fine.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.812
- Murderer!
- You're fine. You're alive! Shh, shh, shh!

13:32.846 --> 13:34.681
- You are mur...
- No, no!

13:34.714 --> 13:37.717
I am not a murderer,

13:37.750 --> 13:40.087
you stupid head!

13:42.722 --> 13:44.191
Figured out the power problem!

13:44.224 --> 13:45.758
Okay, now,

13:45.859 --> 13:48.095
the rabbit goes around the tree

13:48.195 --> 13:50.397
and back into the hole.

13:50.430 --> 13:53.400
Is the dehydrated milk
up here somew...

13:53.433 --> 13:55.068
The hell are you doing?

13:55.102 --> 13:57.905
- Killing myself.
- Why, other than the obvious?

13:57.938 --> 14:00.073
Well, sometimes
killing ourselves

14:00.107 --> 14:03.543
is the most noble thing we
can do for our fellow survivors.

14:03.576 --> 14:05.545
Have you ever thought about it?

14:05.578 --> 14:07.414
Okay, nope, get that thing
off your neck.

14:07.447 --> 14:08.748
Uh-oh.

14:08.781 --> 14:11.551
You know what we have
on our hands here, Cyril?

14:11.584 --> 14:14.187
A dirty mutineer.

14:24.064 --> 14:26.599
"And finally, to my crewmates:

14:26.633 --> 14:28.435
"I regret leaving this world
so early,

14:28.468 --> 14:31.939
"but I shall see you
in the next." Good?

14:31.972 --> 14:35.475
Then maybe something like,
um, "All my love, Cyril."

14:35.575 --> 14:37.577
Please eat me."

14:37.610 --> 14:40.480
Hmm. Yeah.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.950
See? He thinks it's good too.

14:42.983 --> 14:45.252
Now let's find you
a load-bearing pipe.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.794
Hello?

14:54.827 --> 14:56.596
Can anyone hear me?

14:56.629 --> 14:57.965
Over.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.599
Ooh! What about eye patches?

14:59.632 --> 15:02.302
I mean, we don't actually have
to have our eyes cut out

15:02.335 --> 15:04.304
to wear them...
Unless you want to.

15:04.337 --> 15:05.772
Can anyone hear me?

15:05.805 --> 15:08.441
Arr, this is
Space Pirate Cheryl. Go ahead.

15:08.475 --> 15:10.310
There's a psycho loose
on the ship!

15:10.343 --> 15:12.745
She's brainwashing the crew
to kill themselves

15:12.779 --> 15:14.414
so she can eat us!

15:14.447 --> 15:15.949
Sterling!

15:15.983 --> 15:18.418
Cheryl, listen to me.
We have to go in there.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.253
Duh, of course
we have to go in there.

15:20.287 --> 15:21.921
There's someone
brainwashing people

15:21.955 --> 15:23.523
into killing themselves!

15:23.623 --> 15:25.258
- Hurry up!
- Let's go!

15:25.292 --> 15:26.826
All right, me hearties, open up!

15:26.859 --> 15:28.661
Here be breakfast!

15:28.695 --> 15:30.830
Well, well,

15:30.863 --> 15:33.000
well. Looks like we have

15:33.033 --> 15:35.835
a dirty traitor in our midst.

15:35.868 --> 15:37.971
I think you know
what to do, Cyril.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.845
What the hell is this?

15:45.878 --> 15:47.114
Cyril's trying to kill me!

15:47.147 --> 15:48.881
Then I'm gonna kill myself.

15:48.982 --> 15:50.483
Then they want us to eat them.

15:50.517 --> 15:54.054
- Smart.
- Cyril, you idiot, Price is space-mad.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.223
She convinced her crew
to kill themselves

15:56.323 --> 15:57.457
so she could eat them.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.326
Wh... Wow.

15:59.359 --> 16:01.628
I... never.

16:01.661 --> 16:05.065
I am Glenda Macmillan Price,

16:05.165 --> 16:07.300
intergalactic hero,

16:07.334 --> 16:09.536
and I'll be damned
if you'll accuse me...

16:13.240 --> 16:16.209
Hey, guys?
We're down to auxiliary power.

16:16.243 --> 16:18.211
No way to know
how that happened.

16:18.245 --> 16:20.880
But I do have an idea.
Captain Price, you said

16:20.913 --> 16:23.316
your ship was lodged
in the digestive tract,

16:23.350 --> 16:26.019
- but it's not out of power, correct?
- That's right.

16:26.053 --> 16:27.754
Well, if the fuel rods
are undamaged,

16:27.854 --> 16:29.889
conceivably, we could
hook up our generator

16:29.922 --> 16:31.591
to the Tristan,
throw the switch,

16:31.691 --> 16:33.726
and it could
generate enough heat

16:33.760 --> 16:36.163
- possibly to induce vomiting.
-

16:36.196 --> 16:38.074
- What the hell is that sound?
- Those are the giant

16:38.098 --> 16:39.932
man-eating parasites
that have been chasing us

16:40.033 --> 16:43.002
since Archer set off the blast
charges Price told us not to!

16:43.036 --> 16:46.106
I think we all learned
a valuable lesson from that

16:46.206 --> 16:48.575
that we wouldn't
have known otherwise, and...

16:48.608 --> 16:49.942
now we know.

16:51.711 --> 16:53.213
You idiot!

16:53.246 --> 16:55.524
I've been successfully hiding
from those things for years!

16:55.548 --> 16:57.917
Hey, how about this?
I say we try Krieger's idea.

16:57.950 --> 16:59.419
Lana, get behind the wheel

16:59.452 --> 17:01.064
and get this sucker ready
to blow out of here.

17:01.088 --> 17:03.390
Cyril, stop trying
to kill yourself.

17:03.423 --> 17:04.857
Aw, Archer.

17:04.891 --> 17:06.069
Help Krieger ready the boosters,

17:06.093 --> 17:07.894
then kill yourself if you want.

17:07.926 --> 17:09.771
Captain, you're coming with me
and Pam back to your ship

17:09.796 --> 17:11.531
to show us
where the fuel rods are.

17:11.564 --> 17:14.467
Then we hook them up
and get the hell out.

17:14.567 --> 17:15.602
Whoohoo!

17:15.635 --> 17:19.106
Suicide cult, here I come!

17:21.773 --> 17:23.943
Damn it!
How does this beast stay alive

17:23.976 --> 17:25.778
- with all these parasites?
- Yeah.

17:25.811 --> 17:27.079
Plus I think we saw a tumor.

17:27.114 --> 17:28.881
He seems so young, too.

17:33.420 --> 17:36.289
Come on! I was about
to do my finishing move.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.297
Hey, wait a minute,

17:44.331 --> 17:46.799
I thought you said the crew
ran out of rations, Price.

17:46.833 --> 17:50.237
Fine! Yes!
I went space-crazy, okay?

17:50.270 --> 17:51.638
I killed some of the crew,

17:51.671 --> 17:53.573
some killed each other
at my order,

17:53.606 --> 17:56.809
and others killed themselves
to escape my bloodthirsty wrath.

17:56.843 --> 17:58.845
You're like a dog
with a bone about this.

17:58.945 --> 18:00.947
- God!
- All right, here,

18:00.980 --> 18:02.315
hook them up.

18:02.349 --> 18:04.784
There's just one problem.

18:04.817 --> 18:06.377
Archer, what the hell
is taking so long?

18:06.453 --> 18:07.954
We have to get moving.

18:07.987 --> 18:09.356
Uh, we've got a little problem.

18:09.456 --> 18:10.523
What is it?

18:10.623 --> 18:12.292
When we transfer power
between the ships,

18:12.325 --> 18:14.794
the Seamus will immediately
shoot out of this thing...

18:14.827 --> 18:16.805
Hopefully through its mouth
and not its duke chute.

18:16.829 --> 18:20.300
Shut up, Pam. But in doing so,

18:20.333 --> 18:23.303
whoever powers up the Tristan
will be left behind.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.805
Over?

18:25.838 --> 18:28.107
- Well...
- Wait, what's that?

18:28.141 --> 18:31.478
I-I can barely hear you.

18:33.713 --> 18:35.548
Price should stay back?

18:35.648 --> 18:38.050
I didn't hear anything.

18:38.151 --> 18:39.886
Unanimous vote, you say?

18:39.986 --> 18:42.054
Well, looks like
the people have spoken.

18:42.155 --> 18:44.524
So give us, like, to the count
of 60 to get back,

18:44.557 --> 18:45.825
then juice this baby up.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.627
The hell I'm staying back.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.729
Glenda Price
didn't eat directly out

18:49.829 --> 18:52.699
of a bridge crewman's
eye socket to die here today.

18:52.732 --> 18:55.168
Price, listen, you're
a self-obsessed megalomaniac

18:55.202 --> 18:58.037
who sacrificed her crew
for her own survival.

18:58.070 --> 18:59.739
You only ever
thought of yourself.

18:59.839 --> 19:01.374
- You're a villain.
- Ugh.

19:01.408 --> 19:03.376
But in your final moments,
you can be remembered

19:03.410 --> 19:04.844
for all the good you did

19:04.877 --> 19:08.515
instead of your,
you know, cannibalism.

19:08.548 --> 19:12.051
But how would people know
what I did to save you all?

19:12.084 --> 19:15.822
Here, I'll record
your heroic farewell.

19:15.855 --> 19:19.692
And I promise,
the entire galaxy will hear it.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.361
Okay.

19:21.394 --> 19:24.264
This is Captain Glenda Price
of the Tristan.

19:24.364 --> 19:28.335
Of all the many humanitarian
missions I've been on,

19:28.368 --> 19:30.503
all the lives I've saved,

19:30.537 --> 19:32.104
this last act of bravery

19:32.205 --> 19:34.674
shall be my greatest.

19:34.707 --> 19:38.177
Sure, there will be songs
of my courage

19:38.211 --> 19:41.881
and statues in my honor.

19:41.914 --> 19:45.585
But know that serving
my fellow man...

19:48.221 --> 19:51.924
it was my privilege.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.360
Get out of here.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.863
Captain's orders!

19:56.896 --> 19:58.465
Aye, aye, Captain.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.201
For what it's worth,
I would have liked being

20:02.235 --> 20:04.737
an outlaw space pirate with you!

20:04.771 --> 20:06.072
Even though you're kind of mean

20:06.105 --> 20:07.707
and mostly electromagnets,

20:07.740 --> 20:09.476
you're still my favorite!

20:09.576 --> 20:11.944
I hope this thing
chews you like gum,

20:11.978 --> 20:13.946
you crazy bitch.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.583
- All right, Lana, light it up.
- Krieger, are we ready to go?

20:16.616 --> 20:17.950
- Yep, yep, yep.
- Okay.

20:17.984 --> 20:20.119
Captain Price,
for the final time,

20:20.152 --> 20:23.790
please power up for liftoff,
you brave, brave soul.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.057
Aye, aye.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.730
Jesus Christ,
it's one goddamn button, Price.

20:30.763 --> 20:33.123
How hard is it not to screw up
the last moment of your life?

20:38.004 --> 20:40.139
It's working!

20:42.442 --> 20:44.844
It's working.
Hold on. Here we go.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.985
That's them! They got out!

20:53.019 --> 20:55.988
Fly away, you idiot! Fly away!

20:56.022 --> 20:58.791
Stop yelling at me!

21:03.129 --> 21:05.832
Is it just me, or is this
literally the best tea

21:05.865 --> 21:09.001
- in the entire galaxy?
- That's probably the opium talking.

21:09.035 --> 21:11.838
Chasing that space dragon. Rawr!

21:11.871 --> 21:13.640
So now

21:13.673 --> 21:16.142
not only am I
not a part of a suicide cult.

21:16.175 --> 21:18.010
I'm never gonna get a chance
to be ever again.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.712
There, there, dear.

21:19.812 --> 21:22.715
You're dead to me.
That must count for something.

21:22.815 --> 21:24.216
Aw, thanks.

21:24.317 --> 21:26.218
Hey, I forgot to ask...
How did you end up

21:26.319 --> 21:28.287
- getting out of there?
- We were able to generate

21:28.321 --> 21:31.123
enough heat from the fuel rods
that the Zarglorp spit us out.

21:31.157 --> 21:33.159
Oh, of course...
The extra fuel rods

21:33.192 --> 21:34.961
in the downstairs storage room.

21:34.994 --> 21:37.964
I was hoping you'd find those.
Glad they worked out.

21:37.997 --> 21:40.199
Yeah, worked out for everybody.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.636
So you gonna
upload Price's farewell

21:43.670 --> 21:45.372
so the entire galaxy
can hear it?

21:45.405 --> 21:46.873
Are you kidding me?

21:46.906 --> 21:49.175
- I wasn't recording that.
- Wait, what?

21:49.208 --> 21:51.143
What about your promise?

21:51.177 --> 21:53.480
Wow, you really are an asshole.

21:53.513 --> 21:55.582
Oh, I'm the asshole.

21:55.682 --> 21:57.884
Lana, that lady ate people.

21:59.318 --> 22:02.722
Hey, I could
really go for a Moscow Mousse.

22:02.755 --> 22:04.156
You want one?

22:24.544 --> 22:28.114
Made in Georgia.
