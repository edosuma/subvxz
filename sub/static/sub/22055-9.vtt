She goes up and tells
Chef Ramsay that I'm not

02:23.073 --> 02:24.420
accountable for my mistakes.

02:24.523 --> 02:26.767
She's straight up lying,
so I'm just calling

02:26.870 --> 02:28.217
her out on her bullshit.

02:28.320 --> 02:31.427
Hey, Elise, I literallylooked me straight in the eyes

02:31.530 --> 02:33.567
and said I take responsibility
for that chicken,

02:33.670 --> 02:35.431
and you went up thereand told him that I'm not

02:35.534 --> 02:36.432
accountable for my mistakes.

02:36.535 --> 02:37.536
You don't take
responsibility--

02:37.640 --> 02:38.744
I looked you
straight in the eyes.

02:38.848 --> 02:39.711
I'm not going to argue you.

02:39.814 --> 02:41.022
I'm not going to argue with you.

02:41.126 --> 02:42.231
Just because you voted herdown as one of the weakest

02:42.334 --> 02:43.611
players on the team.
Now she's mad.

02:43.715 --> 02:45.026
No, it has nothing
to do with that.

02:45.130 --> 02:46.442
Then what is the
problem, Elise?

02:46.545 --> 02:48.409
You didn't take responsibilityfor tonight's dinner service.

02:48.513 --> 02:49.445
You didn't.

02:49.548 --> 02:50.584
How was the dinner
service my fault?

02:50.687 --> 02:51.688
I'm not going to argue
with you, because it's

02:51.792 --> 02:52.689
not worth my energy.
- How is it my fault?

02:52.793 --> 02:54.277
Bye.

Oh my god with
the boop, Elise.

02:55.658 --> 02:56.486
Yes.

02:56.590 --> 02:57.832
I definitely booped her again.

02:57.936 --> 02:59.386
I don't want to have anyhard feelings with you, Elise.

02:59.489 --> 03:00.456
I don't have
any hard feelings.

03:00.559 --> 03:01.905

dinner service tonight.

side of the kitchen.

03:05.115 --> 03:06.393

03:06.496 --> 03:07.566
Now you're going to have toput your money where your mouth

03:07.670 --> 03:08.740

03:08.843 --> 03:10.086
I've been doing that.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.225
I thought you
were done arguing.

03:11.329 --> 03:12.122
I am done.

03:12.226 --> 03:13.123
Then shut up.

03:13.227 --> 03:14.401
Plus, she's not
going to talk and think

03:14.504 --> 03:16.161
I'm not going to defend myself.

03:16.265 --> 03:17.680
Boop that.

03:17.783 --> 03:19.406
Michelle walks around
with her nose in the air

03:19.509 --> 03:21.511
as though she's like thegreatest chef that ever graced

03:21.615 --> 03:23.203
Hell's Kitchen, and
I'm just waiting to see

03:23.306 --> 03:24.100
the proof in the pudding.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.032
Like, but where though?

03:25.135 --> 03:25.929
Like where?

03:26.033 --> 03:27.552
Where-- where-- where is it at?

03:27.655 --> 03:28.863

take responsibility now.

03:32.142 --> 03:33.282
I took responsibility.

03:33.385 --> 03:34.524
God damn it.

03:34.628 --> 03:36.008
Like, I'm not going tosit up there and lie to try

03:36.112 --> 03:37.217
to kiss ass or be cliquish.
I'm not here for that.

03:37.320 --> 03:38.287
Who lied?

03:38.390 --> 03:39.874
I need zero friends here.I don't care.

03:39.978 --> 03:41.082
- Who lied?- I'm not here for friends.

03:41.186 --> 03:42.498
Who the fuck lied?

03:42.601 --> 03:44.258

07:14.641 --> 07:16.884
Oh my god.

07:16.988 --> 07:18.783
This is disgusting.

07:18.886 --> 07:21.855
All right, well done.

07:21.958 --> 07:23.615
Oh my god.

07:23.719 --> 07:25.410
NARRATOR: Both Van
and Barbie safely

07:25.514 --> 07:26.307
collected six ingredients.

07:26.411 --> 07:27.205
Right.

07:27.308 --> 07:28.344
Next up, grouper.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.208
Go fish.

07:30.311 --> 07:31.520
A litlte starch, Robyn.

07:31.623 --> 07:33.901
NARRATOR: But things aregetting a little more dangerous.

07:34.005 --> 07:34.799
CHEF RAMSEY: Watch out, Van.

07:34.902 --> 07:36.594
Oh, damn.

07:36.697 --> 07:37.974
This is probably
the funniest thing

07:38.078 --> 07:38.975
I've ever seen in my life.

07:39.079 --> 07:39.873
Good job, Robyn.

07:39.976 --> 07:40.770
Well done.

07:40.874 --> 07:41.668
Right, cod.

07:41.771 --> 07:42.600
Go fish.

07:42.703 --> 07:43.739
Let;s go.

07:43.842 --> 07:45.534
These people can cook,
they can handle knives,

07:45.637 --> 07:46.949
but they can't catch a fish.

07:47.052 --> 07:50.055
Cauliflower.

07:50.159 --> 07:52.368
Next round, red snapper.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.612
Fish coming back.

07:54.715 --> 07:55.509
Whoa.

07:55.613 --> 07:56.717
Yes.

07:56.821 --> 07:57.615
Perfect.

07:57.718 --> 07:58.512
Yes.

07:58.616 --> 07:59.858
That's a hot mess.

07:59.962 --> 08:02.067
Oh, it's OK, Elise,
it's called water,

08:02.171 --> 08:04.138
and you'll be fine.

08:04.242 --> 08:05.554
40 seconds to go.

08:05.657 --> 08:07.797
Elise, there's seveningredients on the Blue side.

08:07.901 --> 08:10.351
You only have two
things on the board.

08:10.455 --> 08:12.284
I don't feel sorry
for Elise right now.

08:12.388 --> 08:14.114
Most of us got
seven ingredients,

08:14.217 --> 08:15.011
which is actually a lot.

08:15.115 --> 08:16.047
What's up there?

08:16.150 --> 08:17.531
Asparagus, quinoa.

08:17.635 --> 08:19.395
I don't want to lose,
but at the same time,

08:19.499 --> 08:20.948
it's kind of like karma.

08:21.052 --> 08:22.467
I cannot find shit.

08:22.571 --> 08:23.606
Elise, what are you doing?

08:23.710 --> 08:25.435
Trying to find something.

08:25.539 --> 08:26.747
Oh my fucking goodness.

08:26.851 --> 08:28.438
20 seconds remaining.

08:28.542 --> 08:29.750
Fuck.

08:29.854 --> 08:31.303
Elise, just pick something.

08:31.407 --> 08:33.064
There's no fucking acid.

08:33.167 --> 08:34.617
You're going to
screw your team, Elise.

08:34.721 --> 08:40.002
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and stop.

08:40.105 --> 08:40.899
Mad.

08:43.868 --> 08:45.283
NARRATOR: With all
the chefs armed

08:45.386 --> 08:46.456
with their chosen protein--

08:46.560 --> 08:47.561
Oh, look at that grouper.

08:47.665 --> 08:48.735
Beautiful.

08:48.838 --> 08:50.046
NARRATOR: And up toseven other ingredients--

08:50.150 --> 08:51.876
I'm gonna make like a pesto.

08:51.979 --> 08:52.773
The lemon and the ginger.

08:52.877 --> 08:53.740
It sounds good.

08:53.843 --> 08:54.879
NARRATOR: They will
have 30 minutes

08:54.982 --> 08:56.915
to create a winning fish dish.

08:57.019 --> 08:59.262
Com on, guys, be smart andthoughtful about your dishes.

08:59.366 --> 09:01.471
Make sure your fish is scaled.

09:01.575 --> 09:02.749
Sorry.
You all right?

09:02.852 --> 09:03.646
Yeah, I'm OK.

09:03.750 --> 09:04.751
Sorry.

09:04.854 --> 09:06.822
NARRATOR: But not
everyone is confident.

09:06.925 --> 09:08.271
Mine is going to be
a struggle, because I

09:08.375 --> 09:10.170
only have a few ingredients.

09:10.273 --> 09:13.311
Elise ends up with
three ingredients

09:13.414 --> 09:16.072
and the complaining
just won't stop.

09:16.176 --> 09:17.867
I'm going to try to
be as creative as I can,

09:17.971 --> 09:20.076
but I'm at a disadvantage.

09:20.180 --> 09:21.181
Oh, boy.

09:21.284 --> 09:22.734
What are you all
doing for your dishes?

09:22.838 --> 09:24.322
Concentrating on them.

09:24.425 --> 09:25.979
OK.

09:26.082 --> 09:28.153
Just wanted to see
what's going on.

09:28.257 --> 09:30.777
Just under 19
minutes remaining.

09:30.880 --> 09:32.019
Come on, guys.

09:32.123 --> 09:33.365
Make sure your fish iscooked perfectly, guys, OK?

09:33.469 --> 09:34.263
All right.

09:34.366 --> 09:36.403
Blue Team, we got this one.

09:36.506 --> 09:37.300
I'm feeling good.

09:37.404 --> 09:38.957
I picked some good ingredients.

09:39.061 --> 09:40.027
Nice, you going
for the scales?

09:40.131 --> 09:40.959
Yeah.

09:41.063 --> 09:41.960
Potato crusted Dover sole.

09:42.064 --> 09:42.892
That's nice.

09:42.996 --> 09:43.997
How you sticking them on there?

09:44.100 --> 09:45.239
A little butter.

09:45.343 --> 09:47.138
My sole has soul.

09:47.241 --> 09:48.795
The thing's a work of art.

09:48.898 --> 09:49.899
Good.

09:50.003 --> 09:50.935
10 minutes, guys, here we go.

09:54.386 --> 09:55.560
Fuck.

09:55.664 --> 09:56.665
Are you OK?

09:56.768 --> 09:58.183
Fucking mess.

09:58.287 --> 09:59.529
I throw my fish down.

09:59.633 --> 10:01.566
This thing starts
falling apart, and that

10:01.670 --> 10:04.120
looks like sloppy, hot mess.

10:04.224 --> 10:05.018
You all right?

10:05.121 --> 10:06.571
Do you need any help, Van?

10:06.675 --> 10:07.468
Oh.

10:07.572 --> 10:08.987
- Van?
- Van?

10:09.091 --> 10:09.954
Fucking hell.

10:17.893 --> 10:20.309
NARRATOR: There's less thanseven minutes left in the Catch

10:20.412 --> 10:22.863
of the Day Fish Challenge.

10:22.967 --> 10:23.761
Are you OK?

10:23.864 --> 10:24.900
Fucking mess.

10:25.003 --> 10:27.247
NARRATOR: And Van's
Dover sole is looking

10:27.350 --> 10:28.455
like the one that got away.

10:28.558 --> 10:29.352
You all right?

10:29.456 --> 10:31.389
Do you need any help, Van?

10:32.701 --> 10:33.563
Van?

10:33.667 --> 10:34.737
Fucking hell.

10:34.841 --> 10:35.911
I'm frustrated right now.

10:36.014 --> 10:37.671
I had to throw the
first piece of fish out,

10:37.775 --> 10:39.052
but I got another piece of fish.

10:39.155 --> 10:41.192
I'm about to get it on.

10:41.295 --> 10:44.229
I could be screwed hereif I don't pull this off.

10:44.333 --> 10:47.439
Just under two minutes to go.

10:47.543 --> 10:48.682
Gotta start plating.

10:48.786 --> 10:50.339
Come on, guys, finish strong.

10:50.442 --> 10:51.685
Get out of here.
- Sorry.

10:51.789 --> 10:52.859
Sorry.
- Come on, Robyn.

10:52.962 --> 10:59.589
CHEF RAMSEY: 5 4,
3, 2, 1, and stop.

10:59.693 --> 11:01.177
Well done.

11:01.281 --> 11:03.352
Now, I do have
something very important

11:03.455 --> 11:06.286
to tell you right now.

11:06.389 --> 11:10.048
I'm sending today'swinning team to Las Vegas.

11:10.152 --> 11:11.118
Oh, shit.

11:11.222 --> 11:12.257
Wow.

11:12.361 --> 11:13.327
Oh my god.

11:13.431 --> 11:14.570
I just want to get
out of this place,

11:14.674 --> 11:16.503
and I'm just freaking out.

11:16.606 --> 11:18.056
I want to go to Vegas.

11:18.160 --> 11:19.057
We got to win this one y'all.

11:19.161 --> 11:19.989
Right.

11:20.093 --> 11:21.266
Listen carefully, all of you.

11:21.370 --> 11:24.753
I can't think of a betterjudge to help me today.

11:39.560 --> 11:41.217

I'm a big fan of his.

11:41.321 --> 11:42.287
- Are you well?
- I'm doing well.

11:42.391 --> 11:43.219
How are you?

11:43.323 --> 11:44.462
Very well indeed, thank you.

11:44.565 --> 11:45.912
I love seafood.

11:46.015 --> 11:48.742
He has a beard like mine, andhe's not afraid to show it off.

11:48.846 --> 11:50.192
The beard game is strong.

11:50.295 --> 11:51.331
Right.

11:51.434 --> 11:54.058
Let's start off with
the battle of the cod.

11:54.161 --> 11:54.955
Let's go, please.

11:55.059 --> 11:55.853
Come on, Jennifer.

11:55.956 --> 11:57.820
Let's go, Nick.

11:57.924 --> 11:59.477
All the New
Englanders are up here.

11:59.580 --> 12:01.237
I see y'all.

12:01.341 --> 12:02.825
Nick, go fish.

12:02.929 --> 12:06.311
This Massachusetts girl, Igot a few things up my sleeve.

12:06.415 --> 12:07.830
Jennifer, why don't
we start off with you.

12:07.934 --> 12:09.729
Chefs, it's
pan-seared cod, and then

12:09.832 --> 12:13.318
some candied pecans and haricotsverts with some soy sauce.

12:13.422 --> 12:14.457
Nice balance.

12:14.561 --> 12:16.943
Salty, sweet, I get
that, and seasoned well.

12:17.046 --> 12:17.840
Thank you, Chef.

12:17.944 --> 12:19.186
Fish is nailed.

12:19.290 --> 12:20.912
Beautiful glistening in thecenter, crispy skin on top.

12:21.016 --> 12:21.810
Jennifer, welll done.

12:21.913 --> 12:24.088
Yes!

12:24.191 --> 12:25.399
Nick, describe
the dish, please.

12:25.503 --> 12:27.263
Chefs, what you have
is a pan-roasted cod,

12:27.367 --> 12:30.370
some crispy prosciutto, anda lemon chive beurre blanc.

12:30.473 --> 12:32.303
So you decided to take
the skin off the cod?

12:32.406 --> 12:34.408
Yes, Chef, I'm not
a fan of cod skin.

12:34.512 --> 12:36.203
What?

12:36.307 --> 12:38.205
I would definitely go withJennifer and the Red Team.

12:38.309 --> 12:39.103
Nice job, Jennier,

12:39.206 --> 12:42.485
Yeah, Jennifer!

12:42.589 --> 12:43.417
Nick, you know what?

12:43.521 --> 12:45.730
I'm going to go pack.

12:45.834 --> 12:47.559
Right, next up, the
battle of the grouper.

12:47.663 --> 12:48.457
Let's go.

12:48.560 --> 12:49.354
Come on, Robyn.

12:51.874 --> 12:52.910
Let's start off
with you, Robyn.

12:53.013 --> 12:54.325
Describe your this
dish to Chef, please.

12:54.428 --> 12:57.017
I have a seared grouper withsalsa verde on the bottom,

12:57.121 --> 12:59.364
topped it with
the avocado crema.

12:59.468 --> 13:01.228
I like the creaminess ofthe avocado with the fish

13:01.332 --> 13:02.091
and the salsa verde.

13:02.195 --> 13:03.023
Good job.

13:03.127 --> 13:04.059
Thank you, Chef.

13:04.162 --> 13:05.370
Michelle, please
describe your dish.

13:05.474 --> 13:07.441
Chef, I have a
cast iron grouper.

13:07.545 --> 13:09.927
The broth on the bottom
is cucumber lemongrass.

13:10.030 --> 13:11.860
You know, when you have abig block of fish like that,

13:11.963 --> 13:16.450
you really have to seasonaggressively on all sides.

13:16.554 --> 13:18.280
I got to give it to Robyn.

13:18.383 --> 13:20.454
Good job, Robyn.

13:20.558 --> 13:21.973
- Thank you, Chef.
- Yeah.

13:22.077 --> 13:23.181
What the hell, Robyn?

13:23.285 --> 13:25.321
Like, why couldn't youproduce these good dishes

13:25.425 --> 13:26.529
when you were on the Red Team?

13:26.633 --> 13:29.325
You have to go to the Blue
Team and then beat me?

13:29.429 --> 13:30.568
That's all right.

13:30.671 --> 13:32.708
NARRATOR: The score isnow tied and the Red Team

13:32.812 --> 13:34.330
is hoping that
Elise has pulled off

13:34.434 --> 13:37.023
some magic with her
snapper and her three

13:37.126 --> 13:38.507
additional ingredients.

13:38.610 --> 13:40.198
It kind of feels
like two dishes.

13:40.302 --> 13:41.406
Rather than being
a red snapper dish,

13:41.510 --> 13:42.856
it's more of a quinoa dish.

13:42.960 --> 13:47.067
I only got three ingredients,so I'm at a disadvantage.

13:47.171 --> 13:49.621
I'm so sick and
tired of hearing

13:49.725 --> 13:51.416
Elise and all these excuses.

13:51.520 --> 13:53.763
Sorry, Chef, she putherself at a disadvantage.

13:53.867 --> 13:54.764
You're right, Chef.

13:54.868 --> 13:56.180
It was my fault.

13:56.283 --> 13:58.251
So asparagus, I expectedtwo or three ways,

13:58.354 --> 14:00.563
and that would have helpedbulk up the ingredients

14:00.667 --> 14:02.462
that you're missing.

14:02.565 --> 14:03.635
Milly, please describe to Chef.

14:03.739 --> 14:06.121
What we have here is
a Caribbean red snapper

14:06.224 --> 14:09.020
and cinnamon yams.

14:09.124 --> 14:10.228
I like that.

14:10.332 --> 14:12.023
You've put so much flavorinto that piece of fish

14:12.127 --> 14:14.508
that it just sort of
like stays with you.

14:14.612 --> 14:15.613
I've got to give it to Milly.

14:15.716 --> 14:16.476
Thank you.

14:16.579 --> 14:18.788
Thank you, all.

14:18.892 --> 14:20.549
Elise, you can't blame
anyone but yourself

14:20.652 --> 14:21.930
for only choosing using
three ingredients.

14:22.033 --> 14:23.724
Boop, boop, boop.

14:23.828 --> 14:28.384
Have fun in the dorms.

14:28.488 --> 14:29.765
NARRATOR: The Blue
Team now leads

14:29.869 --> 14:33.355
by one as Benjamin's arcticchar with peas and pancetta--

14:33.458 --> 14:34.425
Love the presentation.

14:34.528 --> 14:35.391
Thank you, Chef.

14:35.495 --> 14:37.014
The fish is
cooked beautifully.

14:37.117 --> 14:39.326
NARRATOR: Faces off againstDana's Atlantic char

14:39.430 --> 14:40.983
with chorizo hash.

14:41.087 --> 14:42.260
The hash is very delicious.

14:42.364 --> 14:44.884
Good flavor with
chorizo and the celery.

14:44.987 --> 14:46.264
Absolutely on point.

14:46.368 --> 14:47.541
Chef, it's a tough one.

14:50.130 --> 14:51.407
I think I have to
give a point to each.

14:51.511 --> 14:53.064
- Yes.
- One to each.

14:53.168 --> 14:54.445
Thank you, Chef.

14:54.548 --> 14:56.688
NARRATOR: With the Blue Teammaintaining their small lead--

14:56.792 --> 14:58.242
We're still in this.

14:58.345 --> 15:00.554
NARRATOR: It all comesdown to Barbie's Dover sole

15:00.658 --> 15:02.004
with creamed leeks.

15:02.108 --> 15:03.833
The fish is cooked
pretty well, I think.

15:03.937 --> 15:05.594
Good job.

15:05.697 --> 15:07.872
NARRATOR: Versus Van's
potato scale Dover sole

15:07.976 --> 15:09.391
with bacon and Swiss chard.

15:09.494 --> 15:10.323
This dish works.

15:10.426 --> 15:12.635
The potato scales are awesome.

15:12.739 --> 15:13.602
Thank you.

15:13.705 --> 15:15.328
Yes, Van.

15:15.431 --> 15:17.123
So this is a tough one, Chef.

15:17.226 --> 15:18.469
I can't even right now.

15:18.572 --> 15:19.470
I can't.

15:19.573 --> 15:20.954
This is so nerve racking.

15:21.058 --> 15:22.369
I just have one
question for you.

15:22.473 --> 15:23.267
Yes, sir?

15:26.028 --> 15:27.340
Are you feeling lucky?

15:27.443 --> 15:28.789
I'm feeling lucky, baby.

15:28.893 --> 15:29.859
Because you're going to Vegas.

15:29.963 --> 15:30.757
Yeah.

15:32.517 --> 15:34.002
Let's go, V.

15:34.105 --> 15:34.899
Yeah, baby.

15:35.003 --> 15:35.865
Thank you, Chef.

15:35.969 --> 15:39.800
Hell, yeah, I'm
feeling lucky, Chef.

15:39.904 --> 15:42.217
Let's go, Blue Team, we'regoing to Vegas, baby.

15:43.908 --> 15:46.738
Yes.

15:46.842 --> 15:49.189
I guess I got
to unpack my bags.

15:49.293 --> 15:51.019
All of you join
me in thanking Chef,

15:51.122 --> 15:52.641
giving up his days
to be here to judge

15:52.744 --> 15:53.676
this incredible competition.

15:53.780 --> 15:54.574
Thank you, Chef.

15:54.677 --> 15:55.609
Thanks so much.

15:55.713 --> 15:56.507
Thanks, guys.

15:56.610 --> 15:59.199
Thank you.

15:59.303 --> 16:01.201
Blue Team, so you know
you're going to Vegas,

16:01.305 --> 16:03.583
but what you don't know
is you'll be staying

16:03.686 --> 16:06.103
overnight at Caesar's Palace.

16:06.206 --> 16:07.759
Incredible.

16:07.863 --> 16:09.175
And if that wasn't
enough, we're going

16:09.278 --> 16:12.454
to get up on the world's
tallest Ferris wheel,

16:12.557 --> 16:16.216
500 feet, the Link High Roller.

16:16.320 --> 16:17.631
Nice.

16:17.735 --> 16:19.944
All right, one more thing--ladies, it's quite a big thing.

16:20.048 --> 16:20.980
You might want to go like that.

16:21.083 --> 16:22.326
Earmuffs?

16:22.429 --> 16:24.984
Arriving in
Vegas is important,

16:25.087 --> 16:27.055
so you've got your
own private plane.

16:27.158 --> 16:28.470
Thank you, Chef.

16:28.573 --> 16:30.023
Get out of here
and have some fun.

16:37.617 --> 16:38.652
Oh my god.

16:38.756 --> 16:40.482
I'm about to go to Vegas
for the first time.

16:43.347 --> 16:44.762
Milly out, wheels up.

16:44.865 --> 16:45.659
I'm gone.

16:50.250 --> 16:54.806
Oh, ladies, you five arein for a slimy difficult day.

16:54.910 --> 16:55.704
Slimey?

16:55.807 --> 16:59.259
Today is fish delivery day.

16:59.363 --> 17:00.640
Ah, fuck.

17:00.743 --> 17:03.608
Hundreds, and I mean hundredsof pounds of the finest fish

17:03.712 --> 17:08.786
available, I want them
descaled, filleted.

17:08.889 --> 17:12.790
Hey, come on, it's not allbad news, because there is

17:12.893 --> 17:15.344
a very special lunch for you.

17:15.448 --> 17:16.725
I'm sure, Chef.

17:16.828 --> 17:19.210
Yep.

17:19.314 --> 17:21.557
Head to the patio.

17:21.661 --> 17:24.905
I had my bags packed,
my outfit ready.

17:25.009 --> 17:28.150
I'm so bummed.

17:28.254 --> 17:29.151
I thought we had it.

17:29.255 --> 17:30.049
I really did.

17:30.152 --> 17:30.946
Yeah, I did too.

17:34.260 --> 17:36.572
Say, what?

17:36.676 --> 17:38.471
Baby.

17:38.574 --> 17:39.679
Yeah, baby.

17:39.782 --> 17:40.576
Look at that.

17:40.680 --> 17:41.612
Wheels up, let's go, y'all.

17:41.715 --> 17:42.889
Here we go, baby.

17:42.992 --> 17:44.235
Never been on a private plane.

17:44.339 --> 17:45.478
Thank you, Wheels Up.

17:45.581 --> 17:48.929
It's party time, so I'm a party.

17:49.033 --> 17:50.793
Balling.

17:50.897 --> 17:52.105
See you later, coach.

17:52.209 --> 17:55.108
I am flying private
planes from here on out.

17:55.212 --> 17:59.008
We just rode straight
through a cloud, bro.

17:59.112 --> 18:00.803
We riding through clouds.

18:00.907 --> 18:05.187
I would like to think myhands for being so great.

18:06.395 --> 18:09.674
Thank you, Milly's hands.

18:09.778 --> 18:10.917
This is going to suck.

18:11.020 --> 18:12.505
Yikes.

18:12.608 --> 18:16.129
Another delivery, likehaven't we finished doing

18:16.233 --> 18:17.544
deliveries in Hell's Kitchen?

18:17.648 --> 18:18.442
I don't understand.

18:18.545 --> 18:20.651
It's a never ending task.

18:20.754 --> 18:21.583
That's not going to work.

18:21.686 --> 18:22.515
You need a hammer, do you?

18:22.618 --> 18:23.412
Yeah, something.

18:23.516 --> 18:26.484
Is there anything else around?

18:26.588 --> 18:30.247
You get it drunk first, Chef.

18:30.350 --> 18:31.282
Here we go.

18:31.386 --> 18:32.180
Oh my god.

18:32.283 --> 18:33.284
Fish delivery day.

18:33.388 --> 18:35.907
Deliver me from this
punishment, please?

18:36.011 --> 18:36.805
Hey.

18:36.908 --> 18:37.702
Oh my god.

18:37.806 --> 18:38.703
Welcome to Hell's Kitchen.

18:43.052 --> 18:45.331
OK, Michelle, I'm
scared to jack this up.

18:45.434 --> 18:46.677
Here, we can do it together.

18:46.780 --> 18:48.886
Push the tip of your knifedown so you stay on the ribs,

18:48.989 --> 18:51.923
and then just get the
the line going first.

18:52.027 --> 18:53.270
I love this teamwork.

18:53.373 --> 18:54.409
You feel these
bones right here?

18:54.512 --> 18:56.100
- Yes.
- Hold it at the end.

18:56.204 --> 18:56.997
OK.

18:57.101 --> 18:58.067
You got it free.

18:58.171 --> 18:59.068
Thank you.

18:59.172 --> 19:00.622
Michelle, we're
turning it around.

19:00.725 --> 19:02.037
I'm tired of fighting.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.591
Just keep going like this,but you have to remember the--

19:04.695 --> 19:08.319
How come Dana's
going that way?

19:08.423 --> 19:10.632
Because Dana wants to
pull a lot of pin bones.

19:10.735 --> 19:11.564
What?

19:11.667 --> 19:14.256
And she flipped it over.

19:14.360 --> 19:17.121
Why are you commenting
on what I'm doing?

19:17.225 --> 19:19.434
I feel like there was
a little bit of unity.

19:19.537 --> 19:22.575
I'm even talking with Michelle,which is progress, because I

19:22.678 --> 19:24.301
had nothing to say to her.

19:24.404 --> 19:25.612
It seems like
everybody's gelling

19:25.716 --> 19:27.856
and then Barbie throwssalt and shade and stuff,

19:27.959 --> 19:30.030
and I don't really
even understand.

19:30.134 --> 19:31.825
Let me get it ready for you.

19:31.929 --> 19:33.172
Want me to show you?

19:33.275 --> 19:34.069
No, I got it.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.312
Please don't take the tail off.

19:35.415 --> 19:36.313
I need it.

19:36.416 --> 19:37.866
Thank you.

19:37.969 --> 19:41.214
I was just taught to cut fisha different way than that.

19:41.318 --> 19:43.043
So I'm going to do it theway that I know how to do it.

19:43.147 --> 19:46.323
I was just taught by
a master sushi chef.

19:46.426 --> 19:48.290
I'm hoping that Barbiecomes back from the dark side,

19:48.394 --> 19:51.120
because I can't deal with herthrowing shade much longer.

19:51.224 --> 19:52.087
What is your problem?

19:52.191 --> 19:53.157
I don't have a problem.

20:04.651 --> 20:06.170
Is it an ice cream sundae?

20:06.274 --> 20:08.517
Chef Ramsay's made
his protein shake.

20:08.621 --> 20:12.245
It looks so good, but
I know that it's not.

20:12.349 --> 20:15.697
Look at Dana go.

20:15.800 --> 20:16.836
Oh my god, I'm going to puke.

20:19.701 --> 20:20.598
Oh my god, that is--

20:20.702 --> 20:21.703
ugh.

20:21.806 --> 20:25.120
I am not feel like
drinking that shake.

20:25.224 --> 20:28.641
I'm going to get throughthis any way I possibly can.

20:34.267 --> 20:35.889
- What, she's throwing it out?- Putting it in the trash can.

20:35.993 --> 20:37.028
Cheating.

20:37.132 --> 20:38.237
Here.

20:38.340 --> 20:40.791
Because Barbie threw it inthe bin, the whole team,

20:40.894 --> 20:41.930
you have to finish it.

20:42.033 --> 20:42.827
What?

20:42.931 --> 20:44.415
We have to finish it?

20:44.519 --> 20:45.554
It's not that serious.

20:45.658 --> 20:47.211
It's not that serious?

20:47.315 --> 20:48.902
I've had enough of Barbie.

20:49.006 --> 20:49.938
She's a lunatic.

20:50.041 --> 20:51.284
Send her as packing.

20:51.388 --> 20:52.423
I'm just going to
get it over with.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.047
Thanks, Barbs.

20:56.151 --> 20:56.945
You're an asshole.

21:01.915 --> 21:14.238

21:14.342 --> 21:16.136

21:19.726 --> 21:20.693
You guys ready to
take it all in?

21:20.796 --> 21:21.866
Yeah.

21:21.970 --> 21:23.282
Chef Christina won our
season, and now she's

21:23.385 --> 21:24.869
Chef Ramsay's right hand woman.

21:31.393 --> 21:33.844
Anything she has to
say, I'm taking notes.

21:33.947 --> 21:36.053
Guys, look at that.

21:36.156 --> 21:36.950
Oh.

21:37.054 --> 21:38.262
Look at that.

21:38.366 --> 21:39.159
I love it.

21:39.263 --> 21:40.160
Shoot for the stars, baby.

21:40.264 --> 21:41.058
Watch your step.

21:44.268 --> 21:45.304
Wait until you see the view.

21:45.407 --> 21:46.235
Oh, I love it.

21:46.339 --> 21:47.547
Take a look at
this strip, guys.

21:47.651 --> 21:48.755
Awesome.

21:48.859 --> 21:50.205
For one of you guys,this is going to be home.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.310
Can't wait to move here.

21:51.413 --> 21:52.725
I've never seen
this many lights.

21:52.828 --> 21:54.105
I've never seen
this much energy.

21:54.209 --> 21:55.003
I love it.

21:55.106 --> 21:56.556
This would be your family.

21:56.660 --> 21:58.109
That's where I want
to be the chef at.

21:58.213 --> 22:00.319
That's the Hell's Kitchen Iwant to be the head chef at.

22:00.422 --> 22:02.355
I already see myselfthere at Caesar's Palace.

22:08.672 --> 22:11.088

22:11.191 --> 22:13.262
in the mouths of
most of the Red Team,

the Blue Team is

22:15.851 --> 22:18.371

22:21.443 --> 22:22.513

22:22.617 --> 22:24.135
That goes with
the papaya salad.

22:24.239 --> 22:26.690
Oh my god, it's
Asian fusion night.

22:26.793 --> 22:30.072
I'm just hoping it doesn'tturn into confusion night.

22:30.176 --> 22:32.143
That shallow fire

23:39.072 --> 23:39.901
Thank you.

23:40.004 --> 23:41.143

23:41.247 --> 23:43.111
You are so amazing.

23:43.214 --> 23:44.215
Black girl power.

23:44.319 --> 23:45.113
I had to say that.

23:45.216 --> 23:46.908
Thank you for coming.

23:47.011 --> 23:50.221

24:04.995 --> 24:06.962
Chef Ramsay comes over
asking Barbie to lead,

24:07.066 --> 24:08.550
and I'm like she don't know how.

24:08.654 --> 24:10.794
So I got to take this overbecause I'm not about to watch

24:17.179 --> 24:18.457
Two salmon, one cod, one lamb.

24:18.560 --> 24:21.770
One cod, one lamb,
followed by two salmon.

24:21.874 --> 24:22.978
OK, sounds good.

24:23.082 --> 24:24.324
Six minutes to the window.

24:26.326 --> 24:28.121
Six minutes heard.

24:28.225 --> 24:31.780
I am on Team Petty, and

Come at me.

- Yes.

24:57.599 --> 24:58.393
Yes?

24:58.497 --> 24:59.290
Yes.

24:59.394 --> 25:00.809
OK, we get it.

25:00.913 --> 25:03.467
All right, we got this.

25:03.571 --> 25:05.676

25:24.695 --> 25:25.489
Robyn, it's a pleasure.

25:25.593 --> 25:26.870
Nice to meet you, Robyn.

25:26.973 --> 25:28.181
Robin is such a ham.

25:28.285 --> 25:31.495
I won three challenges
and three services.

25:31.599 --> 25:32.565
Come on.

25:32.669 --> 25:35.188
And I had to fight
for my life in here.

25:35.292 --> 25:36.638
I think it's great
that she's personable,

25:36.742 --> 25:38.675
but she needs to focus
on why she's here,

25:38.778 --> 25:40.469
and it's not to be
Miss Congeniality.

25:40.573 --> 25:42.299
It's supposedly to
win Hell's Kitchen.

25:42.402 --> 25:43.990
I heart all of you.

25:44.094 --> 25:46.199
Maybe I'll hire
her as my sous chef.

25:46.303 --> 25:47.511
Robyn, what are you doing?

25:47.615 --> 25:49.340
I'm pulling out the pin bones.

25:49.444 --> 25:50.549
I need three minutes.

25:50.652 --> 25:54.138
Robyn, hurry up, will
you, fanning around.

25:54.242 --> 25:55.899
How long for sole,
New York, cod, lamb?

25:56.002 --> 25:58.246
I'm walking garnish
in one minute.

25:58.349 --> 26:02.181
I need two more minutes
on this cod, guys.

26:02.284 --> 26:04.045
OK, so let me tell you
something, Blue Team.

26:04.148 --> 26:05.425
We're slowing down.

26:05.529 --> 26:06.979
Hey, pick your
heads up, less talk.

26:07.082 --> 26:07.911
Let's go.

26:08.014 --> 26:08.843
Not stopping, Chef.

26:12.191 --> 26:14.193
Two cod, two
salmon, two strip.

26:14.296 --> 26:15.850
Two cod, two salmon, two strip.

26:15.953 --> 26:17.955
There are not two
strips, there's one.

26:18.059 --> 26:20.164
2 and 1/2 minutes
to the window, yes?

26:20.268 --> 26:21.718
Two minutes.

26:21.821 --> 26:23.098
It's always the same stuff.

26:23.202 --> 26:25.376
It's like Elise thinks
that she's the queen bee

26:25.480 --> 26:28.276
and Barbie thinks that
she does nothing wrong.

26:28.379 --> 26:31.244
As part of the Red Team,
it sucks for all of us.

26:31.348 --> 26:32.487
Two salmon, two
cod, two strip.

26:32.591 --> 26:33.695
Garnish is in the window.

26:33.799 --> 26:34.972
One strip.

26:35.076 --> 26:36.353
It's one strip, Elise.

26:36.456 --> 26:38.458
Two salmon, two
cod, one strip.

26:38.562 --> 26:39.356
Well, drive it, Barbie.

26:39.459 --> 26:40.633
Don't give me an attitude.

26:40.737 --> 26:42.117
Either you're going todrive the tickets or I will.

26:42.221 --> 26:43.049
Stop.

26:43.153 --> 26:43.981
I'm not doing it tonight.

26:44.085 --> 26:45.086
You have guests in the kitchen.

26:45.189 --> 26:46.259
Knock it off.

26:46.363 --> 26:49.435
Elise is not
going to run shit.

26:49.538 --> 26:51.092
Not today, sister.

26:51.195 --> 26:52.438
Not today.

26:52.541 --> 26:54.578
Where's the cod, and thesalmon, and New York strip.

26:54.682 --> 26:55.544
Coming down.

26:55.648 --> 26:56.442
Walking, Chef.

27:00.584 --> 27:01.516
Hey, come here, you guys.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.276
Oh, Lord, here we go.

27:03.380 --> 27:04.174
Hey, come here, you.

27:04.277 --> 27:05.969
Come here.

27:06.072 --> 27:06.866
All of you.

27:06.970 --> 27:09.558
Fuck.

27:09.662 --> 27:10.732
Bashing the bread.

27:20.569 --> 27:22.744
What's happened?

27:22.848 --> 27:23.918
That is ice cold.
Touch it.

27:24.021 --> 27:25.574
That's cold now.
- Oh, wow.

27:25.678 --> 27:26.472
That's cold.

27:26.575 --> 27:27.473
Cold, Chef.

27:27.576 --> 27:29.509
If you're not
ready, don't send it.

27:29.613 --> 27:30.856
Yes, Chef.

27:30.959 --> 27:33.548
Pretty much five times aday, I say that Barbie sucks.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.101
- Barbie--- Time the time you need.

27:35.205 --> 27:36.206
I am.

27:36.309 --> 27:36.931
Barbie, can I help
you with New Yorks.

27:37.034 --> 27:38.104
No, please, don't.

27:38.208 --> 27:39.865
I'm going for number six.

27:39.968 --> 27:41.245
Barbie sucks.

27:41.349 --> 27:42.591
Barbie, please, don't--

27:42.695 --> 27:43.903
please, bounce back.
- We're OK.

27:44.007 --> 27:45.249
- Let's not fight.
- We're OK.

27:45.353 --> 27:46.803
You're going to fuck
the whole kitchen.

27:46.906 --> 27:47.907
We're good.
We're good.

27:48.011 --> 27:48.805
Let her bounce back.

27:48.908 --> 27:49.702
She can do it.

27:49.806 --> 27:51.428
We're OK.

27:51.531 --> 27:52.671
Let's go.

27:52.774 --> 27:54.086
One order, table
three, one sole,

27:54.189 --> 27:55.604
two lamb, two New York strip.

27:55.708 --> 27:56.605
Yes, Chef.

27:56.709 --> 27:58.573
I'm five minutes out.

27:58.677 --> 27:59.885
- Come on, Van, talk.
- Five minutes, Chef.

27:59.988 --> 28:00.989
Talk, talk, talk.
Let's go.

28:01.093 --> 28:03.923
Come on, Van,
open up that mouth.

28:04.027 --> 28:04.821
How you looking, Milly?

28:04.924 --> 28:07.340
I'm looking good.

28:07.444 --> 28:08.514
Sole right behind you.

28:12.311 --> 28:14.589
Hey, the lamb
beautifully cooked.

28:14.693 --> 28:16.384
Thank you, Chef.

28:16.487 --> 28:19.007
New York strip, fucking raw.

28:19.111 --> 28:21.182
Uh-oh.

28:21.285 --> 28:24.116
It just go in slow
motion, like--

28:24.219 --> 28:28.568
You slowed me down,
it's raw in the middle.

28:28.672 --> 28:30.639
You can't fucking send me that.

28:30.743 --> 28:32.400
Yes, Chef.

28:32.503 --> 28:33.470
Fuck in the pan.

Yes, Chef.

28:37.267 --> 28:38.130
Raw steak.

28:38.233 --> 28:39.476
Oh my fucking god.

28:39.579 --> 28:40.373
Can you give me a time?

28:40.477 --> 28:41.409
Because i will send the lamb.

28:41.512 --> 28:42.893
Um, I need five minutes, Chef.

28:42.997 --> 28:44.584
Fucking hell.

28:44.688 --> 28:46.794
Dude, you have like
13 steaks over there.

28:46.897 --> 28:49.969
Are one of them cooked right?

28:50.073 --> 28:51.522
Boop, as Elise says.

28:51.626 --> 28:52.420
You got another backup?

28:52.523 --> 28:53.559
You got another one?

28:53.662 --> 28:55.078
I got another one,

28:55.181 --> 28:56.700
Chef Ramsay come

28:58.150 --> 28:59.323
Walking steak right now.
- All right.

28:59.427 --> 29:00.393
Now it's turn up time.

29:03.431 --> 29:05.088
Service, please,
John, pick up.

29:05.191 --> 29:06.952
NARRATOR: Milly's steak
is finally meeting

29:07.055 --> 29:08.919
the diners high expectations.

29:09.023 --> 29:10.990
I have to say that my
steak is really good.

29:11.094 --> 29:12.716
While over in
the Red kitchen--

29:12.820 --> 29:13.752
Hi.

29:13.855 --> 29:16.202
The jury is still out.

29:16.306 --> 29:17.272
Salmon garnish.

29:17.376 --> 29:18.446
- Here, check on them now.- Yes, Chef.

29:18.549 --> 29:19.343
All right?

29:19.447 --> 29:21.690
It was just there.

29:21.794 --> 29:22.657
How's it going?

29:22.761 --> 29:25.384
How's your duck?

29:25.487 --> 29:27.593
I can fix that for you.

29:27.696 --> 29:28.490
I have another one.

29:28.594 --> 29:30.941
I can make it more done.

29:31.045 --> 29:32.805
We'll cook you
some more duck, OK?

29:32.909 --> 29:33.702
Yes.

29:33.806 --> 29:36.291
Barbie, he said no.

29:36.395 --> 29:38.190
You guys are-- I'm so sorry.

29:38.293 --> 29:39.605
Are you all enjoying your meal?

29:39.708 --> 29:40.709
Barbie is a nut case.

29:40.813 --> 29:41.814
She's like, I'll
cook it for you.

29:41.918 --> 29:42.746
And he's like, no.

29:42.850 --> 29:44.265
I'm good.
I'll cook it for you.

29:44.368 --> 29:45.197
No, I'm good.

29:45.300 --> 29:46.508
I'll cook it for you.

29:46.612 --> 29:48.027
No, I'm good, so I'm like,this shit is getting weird.

29:48.131 --> 29:49.235
Barbie, he said no.

29:49.339 --> 29:51.410
Like, they see the crazy
in you like we all do.

29:51.513 --> 29:52.307
Chill.

29:55.138 --> 29:57.347
Please fire one
duck garnish for me.

29:57.450 --> 29:59.107
Why am I firing
a duck garnish?

29:59.211 --> 30:00.350
Because we don't
cook for ourselves.

30:00.453 --> 30:01.282
We cook for our guests.

30:01.385 --> 30:02.283
He said he didn't want it.

30:02.386 --> 30:03.353
Our guest wants--

30:03.456 --> 30:04.423
He said he didn't want it.

30:04.526 --> 30:07.150
Fire a duck garnish, please?

30:07.253 --> 30:08.876
Come on, ladies, please?

30:08.979 --> 30:11.119
You're a liar, but
it'll all come out.

30:11.223 --> 30:12.155
Listen.

30:12.258 --> 30:13.052
It's annoying.

30:13.156 --> 30:14.122
It's like weird.
- Stop.

30:14.226 --> 30:15.020
Don't even.

30:15.123 --> 30:15.952
Later.

30:16.055 --> 30:17.125
Barbie?

30:17.229 --> 30:18.023
Elise?

30:19.887 --> 30:20.680
Close the door.

30:20.784 --> 30:22.579
Yes, Chef.

30:22.682 --> 30:24.995
I walked up to the chef tableand asked them how everything

30:25.099 --> 30:26.341
was, and one of our
guests said that he

30:26.445 --> 30:27.826
preferred to have his duckcooked a little bit more,

30:27.929 --> 30:28.792
and I said, OK.
- Fine.

30:28.896 --> 30:30.104
- She's a liar.
- Go ask the table.

30:30.207 --> 30:31.346
She's a liar.

30:31.450 --> 30:32.244
She's mad because I wasdriving the tickets tonight.

30:32.347 --> 30:33.210
She wasn't.

30:33.314 --> 30:36.144
You two, sort it
out now in here.

30:36.248 --> 30:37.042
yes, Chef.

30:37.145 --> 30:38.215
Sort of out in here now.

30:38.319 --> 30:39.113
Your differences.

30:39.216 --> 30:40.252
Yes, Chef.

30:40.355 --> 30:41.529
- We don't cook for ourselves.- Don't start.

30:41.632 --> 30:42.426
You're a lunatic.

30:42.530 --> 30:43.842
It's done.

30:43.945 --> 30:44.739
Don't put your hands in myface and don't fucking call me

30:44.843 --> 30:46.120
a lunatic.
- You're a lunatic.

30:46.223 --> 30:48.156
You're cuckoo like "One FlewOver the Cuckoo's Nest" crazy.

30:48.260 --> 30:49.088
You right.

30:49.192 --> 30:50.020
You absolutely right.

30:54.438 --> 30:56.578
On order, chef's table,
one cod, one salmon,

30:56.682 --> 30:58.442
one New York strip, one duck.

30:58.546 --> 30:59.616
Heard?
- Yes, Chef.

30:59.719 --> 31:00.513
Yes, Chef.

31:00.617 --> 31:01.411
Heard that.

31:01.514 --> 31:02.550
Cod's going in, guys.

31:02.653 --> 31:06.036
And I got New York strip.

31:06.140 --> 31:08.452
Van, do you need any help?

31:08.556 --> 31:10.075
Heard, Van?

31:10.178 --> 31:11.317
Come on, Van.

31:11.421 --> 31:13.561
I'm in front of Dan, my idol.

31:13.664 --> 31:15.770
All I know is you
better not mess this up.

31:15.874 --> 31:16.909
We're good.

31:17.013 --> 31:18.117
Heard.

31:18.221 --> 31:20.809
I'm walking my duck
and my steak right now.

31:20.913 --> 31:23.536
Where's the salmon?

31:23.640 --> 31:24.813
Van, please, connect with me.

31:24.917 --> 31:26.436
I'm getting a little
bit fucked off now.

31:26.539 --> 31:27.886
Bringing it in right now.We have it.

31:27.989 --> 31:29.542
Yeah, but it's your jobto fucking bring it then.

31:29.646 --> 31:30.543
Not me chase you.

31:30.647 --> 31:31.544
Yes, Chef.

31:31.648 --> 31:32.442
Let's go.

31:32.545 --> 31:33.822
Take that.

31:33.926 --> 31:34.720
I'm standing waiting.

31:34.823 --> 31:35.617
I've sliced the duck.

31:35.721 --> 31:37.343
I've sliced the beef.

31:37.447 --> 31:39.207
He's yelling
about your entree.

31:39.311 --> 31:40.139
Yeah.

31:40.243 --> 31:41.416
Not my entree.

31:41.520 --> 31:43.763
It's a little bit toofucking late back over there.

31:43.867 --> 31:46.111
Oh my god, I'm so anxious.

31:46.214 --> 31:47.836
Look.

31:47.940 --> 31:50.460
OK.

31:50.563 --> 31:52.289
Van, you must have
had a longer night

31:52.393 --> 31:53.739
in Vegas than I
did, because you're

31:53.842 --> 31:55.430
moving super slow right now.

31:55.534 --> 31:56.811
Turn the fuck up, bro.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.054
Come one, just put it down.I'll do that.

31:58.157 --> 31:58.675
Put it down.
Go, go, go.

31:58.778 --> 31:59.572
It's hot.

31:59.676 --> 32:00.539
Yeah.

32:00.642 --> 32:02.472
That's over.

32:02.575 --> 32:04.370
I trusted you, Van.

32:04.474 --> 32:06.648
Where's the fucking bounce back?

32:06.752 --> 32:08.098
Van has shut down.

32:17.763 --> 32:20.800
NARRATOR: The restaurantis filled with VIPs and one

32:20.904 --> 32:22.423
very hungry chef's table.

32:22.526 --> 32:23.942
Look.

32:24.045 --> 32:25.322
OK.

32:25.426 --> 32:27.842
NARRATOR: And Van's constantscrew ups on the fish station--

32:27.946 --> 32:29.050
That's over.

32:29.154 --> 32:30.914
NARRATOR: Has Chef
Ramsay asking--

32:31.018 --> 32:33.227
Where's the
fucking bounce back?

32:33.330 --> 32:35.367
Enough's enough.

32:35.470 --> 32:38.715
Van has shut down.

32:38.818 --> 32:39.612
Watch this.

32:39.716 --> 32:40.510
Watch.

32:43.237 --> 32:45.032
Mine's delicious.

32:45.135 --> 32:46.550
How's yours?

32:46.654 --> 32:48.759
Hasn't arrived yet, has it?

32:48.863 --> 32:50.382
Do you need more salmon, Van?

32:50.485 --> 32:51.417
I have one left.

32:51.521 --> 32:54.179
Re-fired salmon,
already here, y'all.

32:54.282 --> 32:55.249
You ain't got to worry about it.

32:55.352 --> 32:57.803
I got one in my back pocket.

32:57.906 --> 33:00.150
Yep, go.

33:00.254 --> 33:02.118
And the salmon.

33:02.221 --> 33:03.015
Thumbs up?

33:03.119 --> 33:04.430
Thumbs down?

33:04.534 --> 33:06.812
It's very good.

33:06.915 --> 33:07.986
Last table, let's go.

33:08.089 --> 33:09.711
Two Dover sole, twosalmon, two New York strip.

33:09.815 --> 33:10.678
Yes, Chef.

33:10.781 --> 33:11.610
How long?

33:11.713 --> 33:13.060
I got six minutes on that one.

33:13.163 --> 33:14.302
On order, four
orders, table 50.

33:14.406 --> 33:15.234
Last table.

33:15.338 --> 33:16.891
Two scallop, two sole, one lamb.

33:16.995 --> 33:17.961
Yes, Chef.

33:18.065 --> 33:18.893
Let's finish strong, guys.

33:18.997 --> 33:19.790
Yes.

33:19.894 --> 33:20.860
Heard.

33:20.964 --> 33:22.103
Duck, Chef.

33:22.207 --> 33:23.725
Duck, nicely cooked.

33:23.829 --> 33:25.831
Sizzle is hot.

33:25.934 --> 33:27.143
Oh, there it is.

33:27.246 --> 33:28.213
The scallops are really good.

33:28.316 --> 33:29.110
Scallops are great.

33:29.214 --> 33:30.146
Oh my god.

33:30.249 --> 33:32.527
Red Team, five desserts.

33:32.631 --> 33:34.564
Yes, Chef.

33:34.667 --> 33:35.427
Stoves off, please, Nick.

33:35.530 --> 33:36.324
Yes, Chef.

33:40.708 --> 33:42.365
I'll keep this brief.

33:42.468 --> 33:45.816
Now, both teams
did finish service,

33:45.920 --> 33:48.302
but I was surprised
by the amount of pain

33:48.405 --> 33:51.408
it took to complete service.

33:51.512 --> 33:57.173
That's why the losing
team tonight is

33:57.276 --> 34:03.489
the Blue Team and the Red Team.

34:03.593 --> 34:06.009
I want both teams to
go back to the dorms

34:06.113 --> 34:09.219
and come up with two peoplethat you'd be stronger without.

34:09.323 --> 34:10.186
Yes, Chef.

34:10.289 --> 34:11.049
Get out of here.

34:14.949 --> 34:15.777
I'm nervous.

34:15.881 --> 34:17.676
I know my service
wasn't perfect.

34:17.779 --> 34:19.816
It could easily be me
up there, you know?

34:19.919 --> 34:20.679
I don't now.

34:20.782 --> 34:21.852
This is so-- this sucks.

34:21.956 --> 34:24.407
This sucks.

34:24.510 --> 34:25.753
This is really horrible.

34:25.856 --> 34:27.893
Van, out of all of
us, I think you have

34:27.996 --> 34:29.998
the most struggles in service.

34:30.102 --> 34:32.311
Van, I think that you canimprove on communication

34:32.415 --> 34:33.347
in the kitchen.

34:33.450 --> 34:34.831
His fault is that
he just gets quiet.

34:34.934 --> 34:37.040
Even when I'm
vocal, I'm quiet.

34:37.144 --> 34:40.940
I'm not putting myself up there.

34:41.044 --> 34:42.183
I'm gonna say Robyn.

34:42.287 --> 34:43.702
Nick, what could I improve on?

34:43.805 --> 34:44.841
Being frazzled.

34:44.944 --> 34:46.808
Yeah.

34:46.912 --> 34:48.224
So I see how it is.

34:48.327 --> 34:50.640
I know I was new to the BlueTeam, so they got to put me up.

34:50.743 --> 34:52.538
I'm doing nothing butgetting better and better,

34:52.642 --> 34:54.264
and that's obviously
a threat to this boys.

34:54.368 --> 34:56.404
Because it's total
bromance going on.

34:56.508 --> 34:57.336
Robyn?

34:57.440 --> 34:58.441
I'm basing it on tonight.

34:58.544 --> 34:59.338
Van and Milly, that's it.

34:59.442 --> 35:00.305
Y'all tripping.

35:00.408 --> 35:01.237
That's how I see it.

35:01.340 --> 35:02.548
I agree.

35:02.652 --> 35:04.481
Tonight I had one
New York comeback.

35:04.585 --> 35:05.379
I'm just being real.

35:05.482 --> 35:06.828
The finesse ain't there.

35:06.932 --> 35:07.933
Fuck that.

35:08.036 --> 35:09.762
Like I'm the weakest
person on this team?

35:09.866 --> 35:11.281
It is what it is, man.

35:11.385 --> 35:14.457
They think that ain't aperson like me deserve to work

35:14.560 --> 35:16.976
for Chef Ramsay in Las Vegas.

35:17.080 --> 35:17.977
That's what it is.

35:18.081 --> 35:19.427
They don't-- they
don't think, like,

35:19.531 --> 35:23.500
it's no way like a guy likethat from a neighborhood

35:23.604 --> 35:25.088
or the way he is.

35:25.192 --> 35:26.193
No.

35:26.296 --> 35:27.435
Fuck all that.

35:27.539 --> 35:29.506
This is about food.

35:29.610 --> 35:32.854
I know if they put me in
a kitchen with anybody

35:32.958 --> 35:36.306
in this building, I'll
wreck them period.

35:36.410 --> 35:38.550
ELISE: Let's all be quiet!

35:38.653 --> 35:39.447
This is ridiculous.

35:39.551 --> 35:40.552
[screaming]

35:42.001 --> 35:44.280
Somebody was running theirmouth running off tickets.

35:44.383 --> 35:45.695
She didn't have garnish up.

35:45.798 --> 35:47.075
Can you wait a minute?

35:47.179 --> 35:48.146
She was telling youwhat the next ticket was.

35:48.249 --> 35:49.630
- Can you wait a minute?
- I never fired it.

35:49.733 --> 35:50.803
Can you wait a minute?

35:50.907 --> 35:51.735
I'm right here.

35:51.839 --> 35:56.084
Fuck off right now.

35:56.188 --> 35:58.949
I'm so sick and tired
of the fucking bullshit.

35:59.053 --> 36:00.537
I'm tired of the bullshit.

36:00.641 --> 36:01.676
Do the vote.

36:01.780 --> 36:03.264
Why you're the only
one who got to speak.

36:03.368 --> 36:04.162
We're done.

36:04.265 --> 36:05.715
Vote.

36:05.818 --> 36:07.061
Elise, because
of the argument.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.512
I'm not the weakest
link on the team though.

36:09.615 --> 36:11.169
We're better off withoutthe attitude though.

36:11.272 --> 36:12.411
Exactly.

36:12.515 --> 36:14.931
But Barbie, the two ofyou were literally fighting.

36:15.034 --> 36:18.003
We all got yelled at for whathappened between you two.

36:18.106 --> 36:20.039
This didn't work at all.

36:20.143 --> 36:22.249
There was more problems inthe kitchen tonight than that,

36:22.352 --> 36:24.320
but I don't think y'allwould be better without me,

36:24.423 --> 36:27.046
but that's fine, because I knowI'm a better chef than she is.

36:27.150 --> 36:28.703
Every single time you'vebeen on the meat station,

36:28.807 --> 36:33.536
that shit is fucking moo, cluck,cluck, like that kind of raw.

36:33.639 --> 36:35.469
That shit was clucking.

36:35.572 --> 36:37.850
BARBIE: You have not
had a good service yet.

36:37.954 --> 36:38.748
You're a lunatic.

36:38.851 --> 36:40.543
I'm the lunatic?

36:40.646 --> 36:43.649
Barbie is a crazy old lady,not just like, girl, you

36:43.753 --> 36:45.996
crazy, but like batshit crazy.

36:46.100 --> 36:47.722
Up here something
is wrong, Barbie.

36:47.826 --> 36:48.654
You need help.

36:48.758 --> 36:52.348
Did she just call me crazy?

36:52.451 --> 36:53.901
You gonna cry tonight, Elise?

36:54.004 --> 36:55.972
No, because you're goingto go home before me.

36:56.075 --> 36:57.042
Yikes.

36:57.145 --> 36:57.939
BARBIE: Are you kidding me?

36:58.043 --> 36:59.355
You're full of shit.

36:59.458 --> 37:01.219
You're a liar, and you're aschemer, and you're a cheater.

37:01.322 --> 37:02.565
You'll never win.

37:02.668 --> 37:05.602
Even if you make it pasttonight, you'll never win.

37:05.706 --> 37:07.121
You're not going to beat me out.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.571
You'll never win.
- I love it.

37:08.674 --> 37:09.813
So I'm not worried about it.

37:09.917 --> 37:11.401
She just wants to throw
people under the bus.

37:11.505 --> 37:12.644
This is not a bus ride.

37:12.747 --> 37:13.576
It's a train wreck.

37:13.679 --> 37:14.715
You're a train wreck.

37:14.818 --> 37:16.924
Choo choo, choo choo,
choo choo, motherfucker.

37:17.027 --> 37:17.821
Choo choo.

37:30.524 --> 37:31.318
Nick?

37:31.421 --> 37:32.250
Yes, Chef?

37:32.353 --> 37:34.010
Blue Team's first
nominee and why.

37:34.113 --> 37:35.736
Our first nominee
is Robyn, Chef.

37:35.839 --> 37:37.255
She's still a little
unsure of herself,

37:37.358 --> 37:40.050
and to win this competition, youhave to be absolutely positive

37:40.154 --> 37:41.466
that you're going to win.

37:41.569 --> 37:43.640
Blue Team's second
nominee and why.

37:43.744 --> 37:46.160
Our second nominee
is Milly, Chef.

37:46.264 --> 37:47.713
Milly had one of the
poorer performances

37:47.817 --> 37:48.783
in service tonight.

37:48.887 --> 37:50.854
When we in there on
the line, you ain't

37:50.958 --> 37:52.166
never got to worry about me.

37:52.270 --> 37:53.409
I'm not arguing with you.

37:53.512 --> 37:54.824
Don't.

37:54.927 --> 37:59.863
Blue Team, I want to
hear from somebody else.

37:59.967 --> 38:04.247
Robyn, Milly, Van, step forward.

38:07.871 --> 38:10.805
Van, 30 seconds, why shouldyou stay in Hell's Kitchen?

38:10.909 --> 38:12.290
Because I'm a hard worker.

38:12.393 --> 38:14.050
I got creativity.

38:14.153 --> 38:15.223
I can cook.

38:15.327 --> 38:17.881
I have a gift to make
people happy with food,

38:17.985 --> 38:20.332
and I just feel
like I can win this.

38:20.436 --> 38:21.471
Stay there.

38:21.575 --> 38:23.059
Robyn, 30 seconds.

38:23.162 --> 38:24.785
I'm passionate,
hardworking, loyal.

38:24.888 --> 38:26.131
I'm honest.

38:26.234 --> 38:28.444
I don't think I deserve tobe up here right now, Chef.

38:28.547 --> 38:30.066
Robyn, back in line.

38:30.169 --> 38:32.517
Thank you, Chef.

38:32.620 --> 38:34.726
Milly, 30 seconds, why shouldyou stay in Hell's Kitchen?

38:34.829 --> 38:36.762
I have the most
passion, and I want

38:36.866 --> 38:39.178
this more than life period.

38:39.282 --> 38:42.458
I'm confident when I taste myfood, and I went into the pass,

38:42.561 --> 38:44.494
I don't even got to check tosee if y'all like it or not,

38:44.598 --> 38:46.565
because I know for a
fact that it's the right

38:46.669 --> 38:48.671
standard and it tastes great.

38:48.774 --> 39:00.786
My decision is,
Milly, get back in line.

39:00.890 --> 39:01.684
Thank you, Chef.

39:06.205 --> 39:09.277
Van, come here.

39:09.381 --> 39:11.866
Yes, Chef.

39:11.970 --> 39:15.076
Young man, keep
your head up, focus,

39:15.180 --> 39:16.768
and continue on that journey.

39:16.871 --> 39:17.665
Thank you, Chef.

39:23.671 --> 39:25.604
Bye, Van.

39:25.708 --> 39:27.848
Wow.

39:27.951 --> 39:30.298
Hell no, I'm not theweakest chef on the Blue Team,

39:30.402 --> 39:32.370
but I'm not going to sit
here and argue about it.

39:32.473 --> 39:34.372
I definitely came
here this time to let

39:34.475 --> 39:37.098
my cooking speak for itself,but it didn't work out.

39:37.202 --> 39:38.893
Move on to the next one.

39:38.997 --> 39:41.068
I just want to make
people happy with food.

39:41.171 --> 39:41.965
I'm not done yet.

39:46.867 --> 39:49.317
Dana, first nominee and why.

39:49.421 --> 39:51.665
Our first nominee
is Elise, Chef.

39:51.768 --> 39:54.530
Sometimes she bullies membersof the team, when we're trying

39:54.633 --> 39:57.256
to get food out of
the kitchen, and we

39:57.360 --> 40:01.226
weren't really hearing thecall because she was fighting.

40:01.329 --> 40:02.848
Red Team, second
nominee and why, please.

40:02.952 --> 40:05.679
Our second nominee
tonight is Barbie.

40:05.782 --> 40:07.405
She does not get
along with the team,

40:07.508 --> 40:10.200
and she's had several poorperformances in service.

40:10.304 --> 40:11.581
And you can't cook
meat, your shit be

40:11.685 --> 40:13.203
clucking at the fucking pass.

40:13.307 --> 40:14.101
Cluck.

40:14.204 --> 40:16.103
Her shit be clucking.

40:16.206 --> 40:17.449
- And a moo.
- Moo.

40:17.553 --> 40:19.071
Oh, yeah, her shit's mooing too.You right.

40:19.175 --> 40:20.003
She could milk that shit.

40:20.107 --> 40:23.041
It was so alive.

40:23.144 --> 40:24.629
Barbie, Elise, step forward.

40:27.977 --> 40:30.117
Barbie, 30 seconds, why shouldyou stay in Hell's Kitchen?

40:30.220 --> 40:31.463
I made some
mistakes, but I will

40:31.567 --> 40:32.913
not make those mistakes again.

40:33.016 --> 40:35.053
I have tried to get
along with my team.

40:35.156 --> 40:36.813
My team does not want to listen.

40:36.917 --> 40:38.263
They do not want to
humble themselves

40:38.366 --> 40:41.128
and they do not want tobe honest with themselves.

40:41.231 --> 40:43.199
Elise, 30 seconds, why shouldyou stay in Hell's Kitchen?

40:43.302 --> 40:44.890
I'm the strongest
member of the Red Team.

40:44.994 --> 40:47.168
I've been in the top of thechallenges, unlike Barbie.

40:51.103 --> 41:05.877
My decision is Elise andBarbie, get back in line.

41:13.056 --> 41:15.542
So let this be a
warning to all of you.

41:15.645 --> 41:17.475
When I tell you what
your weaknesses are,

41:17.578 --> 41:19.718
you need to correct
them quickly,

41:19.822 --> 41:21.479
otherwise you'll be gone.

41:21.582 --> 41:24.136
Now fuck off, will you?

41:24.240 --> 41:25.517
That was intense.

41:25.621 --> 41:29.314
I don't even know what happened,but Barbie is still here.

41:30.349 --> 41:31.765
This, this is not
happening again.

41:31.868 --> 41:33.076
This cannot happen again.

41:33.180 --> 41:36.010
We need to trim some morefat, and I'm not fat.

41:36.114 --> 41:39.704
Listen, Blue Team, I am
not any of your friends.

41:39.807 --> 41:42.776
I will be your
employer, if anything.

41:42.879 --> 41:46.676
Thank you all for showingme who you were, Blue Team.

41:46.780 --> 41:48.920
CHEF RAMSEY: Van's always hadone of the loudest voices here.

41:49.023 --> 41:52.786
Tonight, not only did he losehis voice, but also his dream

41:52.889 --> 41:54.442

41:59.862 --> 42:02.209

Let's go, Blue.

42:08.664 --> 42:11.080
Will one chef go
on a power trip?

42:11.183 --> 42:12.737
Milly, come here right now.

42:12.840 --> 42:14.359
Nick, I don't know
what you're doing, bro.

42:14.462 --> 42:15.463
I need it cooked perfectly.

42:15.567 --> 42:16.395
No more of this shit.

42:16.499 --> 42:18.018
Nick, get the
fuck out of here.

42:18.121 --> 42:20.123
NARRATOR: Does Milly
get the last laugh?

42:20.227 --> 42:21.159
Watch this, Nick.

42:21.262 --> 42:22.954
I've got something for you, boy.

42:23.057 --> 42:24.680
Nick, scallops
are overcooking.

42:24.783 --> 42:27.096
Milly.

42:27.199 --> 42:29.719
NARRATOR: And will the womenfinally take their chance--

42:29.823 --> 42:31.376

of these broads.

42:36.381 --> 42:37.969

Fucking hell.

42:39.004 --> 42:40.247
What the fuck is this?

42:40.350 --> 42:41.904
Oh my god.

42:42.007 --> 42:43.353
I'm not being nice anymore.

42:43.457 --> 42:46.218
NARRATOR: Hell hath nofury like an Elise scorned.

42:46.322 --> 42:48.255
