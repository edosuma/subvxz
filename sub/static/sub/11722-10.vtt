My sweet Cassie,
you finding this means I'm gone,

00:04.573 --> 00:05.906
and for that I am so sorry.

00:05.974 --> 00:07.358
I didn't want you
to have this life,

00:07.442 --> 00:09.693
but destiny's not easy
to run from.

00:09.905 --> 00:13.210
You're a witch. You're a
full-blooded 100% witch.

00:13.358 --> 00:14.775
A complete circle is six.

00:14.843 --> 00:16.026
You complete the circle.

00:16.111 --> 00:17.194
She's got the gift.

00:17.279 --> 00:19.613
You can get Cassie
to do what we need?

00:19.681 --> 00:22.066
The circle will take care of
that without even knowing it.

00:22.150 --> 00:23.984
Henry's body just
turned up dead.

00:24.035 --> 00:26.437
Your mistake forced us
to silence Jane.

If you think
the rest of the elders

aren't paying attention
to this town right now,

00:28.890 --> 00:30.791
you're full of it.
That's my father.

00:30.859 --> 00:32.042
- John Blackwell?
- Yeah.

00:32.127 --> 00:34.545
Cassie's dark magic
comes from Balcoin.

00:34.629 --> 00:36.497
The name was changed
to Blackwell.

00:36.548 --> 00:38.198
Why are you
showing me this?

00:38.250 --> 00:40.885
Your father's lineage
is from strong dark magic.

00:40.969 --> 00:42.703
That's why you have
the power you do.

00:42.754 --> 00:44.472
We're taking Cassie
with us.

00:44.539 --> 00:46.841
Cassie's in trouble.
You have to help me save her.

01:33.871 --> 01:35.038
what the hell
are you doing here?

01:35.122 --> 01:38.124
Your front door
was opened.

01:38.191 --> 01:39.659
You should be more careful.

01:42.162 --> 01:44.530
You left with
witch hunters.

01:44.581 --> 01:46.049
Whose side
are you on?

01:46.116 --> 01:48.318
Yours.

They weren't
very happy with me

after I helped you
get away.

You just expect me to...
to welcome you back?

01:59.930 --> 02:00.880
No.

02:00.931 --> 02:02.732
I have to talk to you

02:02.800 --> 02:04.584
about dark magic.

02:04.652 --> 02:07.320
Yeah, I keep
remembering...

02:07.387 --> 02:09.722
What you said

02:09.773 --> 02:11.274
about how I can
control it.

02:11.358 --> 02:12.892
You can't control it.

02:12.960 --> 02:15.695
That's what I came
to tell you.

02:15.746 --> 02:17.396
You said I could.

02:17.448 --> 02:19.932
You said that I was a good person
and could deal with it.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.534
No.

02:21.585 --> 02:22.769
Evil is evil.

02:22.836 --> 02:26.572
I wanted to help.

02:26.640 --> 02:31.110
The truth is,
no one can.

You think I'm evil?

02:36.917 --> 02:42.055
You don't me to tell you,

02:43.640 --> 02:46.926
You have evil blood.

It's been two days.

just worried.

04:07.391 --> 04:08.674
I was worried.

Isn't that enough?

04:24.792 --> 04:25.875
On the boat that night,

04:25.959 --> 04:30.630
you knew the witch hunter
wasn't gonna hurt me

04:30.697 --> 04:33.132
because you knew
he was afraid of you.

04:33.200 --> 04:35.568
Why?

04:35.636 --> 04:37.170
I've never heard the name.

04:37.221 --> 04:40.139
Jake said Francis Balcoin was
as evil as they come,

04:40.207 --> 04:44.310
that he passed dark power from
generation to generation.

04:44.377 --> 04:48.181
To my father, to me.

04:48.232 --> 04:52.485
Jake. That's where
we're getting the truth now?

04:52.553 --> 04:54.737
Come on, is evil power even
something you can pass down?

04:54.822 --> 04:56.072
What, is it like eye color?

04:56.156 --> 04:58.357
It would explain how
I can do magic outside the circle.

04:58.408 --> 05:00.059
Well, it's one explanation.

05:00.110 --> 05:02.495
Maybe another is that
your mom's side

05:02.562 --> 05:04.563
passed down good power
for 400 years.

05:04.615 --> 05:06.699
I like the optimism.

05:06.750 --> 05:08.234
Both my parents
are witches,

05:08.285 --> 05:10.586
it's possible I take
after the good side.

05:10.671 --> 05:12.121
What did your
grandmother say?

05:13.924 --> 05:16.092
Kind of what you
just said.

05:16.176 --> 05:19.762
That I'm just like
my mom, so not to worry.

05:19.847 --> 05:21.998
Maybe you should
listen to her.

05:22.065 --> 05:24.684
I don't know. She hasn't
been herself lately.

05:24.751 --> 05:27.419

11:03.774 --> 11:04.924
We can all figure
this out together.

11:04.976 --> 11:06.943
Don't!

11:10.231 --> 11:11.531
[Gasping]

11:12.617 --> 11:14.201
Adam. Adam! No!
No, no, no!

11:14.268 --> 11:15.652
I didn't mean it!

11:15.736 --> 11:16.653
Adam, no!
I didn't mean it.

11:16.737 --> 11:18.605
I didn't mean it.
I didn't...

11:18.656 --> 11:20.773
[Panting]

11:23.578 --> 11:24.961
I'm sorry.

11:25.046 --> 11:27.130
I'm so sorry.

11:38.694 --> 11:40.745
You did that to me.

11:40.812 --> 11:42.877
I don't know what happened.

11:42.878 --> 11:44.595
You got upset.

11:44.646 --> 11:47.398
And my throat
started closing up.

11:47.465 --> 11:48.566
Like what
happened with Luke.

11:48.633 --> 11:49.633
You did that,
too.

11:49.684 --> 11:51.268
Mm-mmm.
Totally different.

11:51.319 --> 11:53.237
Luke went up in flames.

11:53.305 --> 11:54.355
What's wrong
with you?

11:54.472 --> 11:56.440
I don't know.

12:03.248 --> 12:06.650
It's always the short quiet ones
you have to watch out for.

12:06.701 --> 12:08.819
Shut up, Faye.

12:08.870 --> 12:10.087
Cassie, hold on.

12:10.154 --> 12:11.672
I'm sorry.

12:11.756 --> 12:14.592
I saw you guys talking about my
dark magic problem.

12:14.659 --> 12:16.343
I didn't tell Diana.

12:16.411 --> 12:18.512
She saw what I was
looking at on my computer

12:18.597 --> 12:20.347
and guessed.

12:20.432 --> 12:22.666
Then I am sorry
again,

12:22.717 --> 12:25.168
for almost killing you and
not trusting you.

12:25.220 --> 12:27.838
I'm not looking
for more apologies.

12:27.889 --> 12:31.508
I'm just trying
to understand.

12:32.477 --> 12:33.844
Join the club.

12:35.881 --> 12:38.048
[Door closes]

12:47.459 --> 12:49.359
You sounded upset
on the phone. What's wrong?

12:49.411 --> 12:52.246
Your mother.
She came to see me.

12:52.330 --> 12:53.664
About what?

12:53.715 --> 12:55.532
She said she was gonna get to
the bottom of what happened

12:55.584 --> 12:57.418
and that she wouldn't stop until
she figured out

12:57.502 --> 12:58.802
what I was up to.

12:58.870 --> 13:01.255
Nobody knows anything.

13:01.339 --> 13:02.590
Ethan does.

13:02.674 --> 13:03.757
You almost
drowned him.

13:03.842 --> 13:05.142
Which is why he's
too scared to talk.

13:05.209 --> 13:07.011
He wasn't too scared
to tell Henry

13:07.062 --> 13:08.646
that you were
practicing magic.

13:08.713 --> 13:10.047
And if he tells Kate,

13:10.098 --> 13:11.548
then she will know
that you have a crystal,

13:11.600 --> 13:12.816
and our plan is over.

13:12.884 --> 13:15.603
We've got to get rid
of her.

13:15.687 --> 13:18.072
Well, I can't just kick her out
of town. She just got here.

13:18.156 --> 13:21.058
I'm not talking about
kicking her out of town.

13:21.109 --> 13:25.395
Dawn, we are not
killing anyone else,

13:25.447 --> 13:27.448
certainly not my mother.

13:27.532 --> 13:29.333
Killing Henry
caused enough trouble.

13:29.400 --> 13:30.734
What do you want to do,
just kill all the elders?

13:30.785 --> 13:33.671
Look, I know
how it sounds,

13:33.738 --> 13:36.340
but the elders
stripped us of our powers.

13:36.407 --> 13:38.075
They diminished us
to nothing.

13:38.126 --> 13:40.678
They are the ones standing in
our way of moving forward.

13:40.745 --> 13:42.412
Calm down.

13:42.464 --> 13:43.514
There are other options.

13:43.581 --> 13:44.765
Like what?

13:44.849 --> 13:47.017
Spelling the elders
into not asking questions?

13:47.085 --> 13:48.185
That worked so well
with Jane.

13:48.252 --> 13:50.437
I'll figure out a way
to deal with my mother.

13:50.505 --> 13:52.022
Look, if she keeps
asking questions--

13:52.090 --> 13:53.974
I'll handle it.

13:55.110 --> 14:00.097
For now, just stay
out of her way.

14:08.206 --> 14:12.493
Did you rip this page
out of Cassie's Book of Shadows?

14:12.577 --> 14:14.277
[Knock on door]

14:16.715 --> 14:17.548
What are you doing?

14:17.615 --> 14:20.283
Nothing.
It's stupid.

14:21.285 --> 14:22.803
An attraction spell.

14:22.887 --> 14:24.838
Who are you trying
to attract?

14:24.923 --> 14:27.558
Not attract, exactly.

14:27.625 --> 14:31.929
Just...Bring back
to town.

14:31.980 --> 14:34.631
Jake?

14:34.683 --> 14:36.400
No. No way.

14:36.467 --> 14:39.136
You remember he's
a witch hunter, right?

14:39.187 --> 14:41.989
Yes, but he also
risked his life to save mine.

14:42.057 --> 14:42.990
And Adam's.

14:43.074 --> 14:44.074
And he's the only one of us

14:44.142 --> 14:46.143
who seems to understand
dark magic.

14:46.194 --> 14:48.478
What happened today
was an accident.

14:48.530 --> 14:49.646
That's not who you are.

14:49.698 --> 14:51.131
How do you know?

14:51.199 --> 14:52.850
I just do.

14:54.318 --> 14:57.254
Come stay at my house until your
grandmother's back in town.

14:57.321 --> 14:59.256
She's only gone
for like a day or so.

14:59.323 --> 15:00.591
Well, until she's back,

15:00.658 --> 15:03.343
you're not
staying alone.

15:03.428 --> 15:06.814
Did you rip this page
out of Cassie's Book of Shadows?

15:06.881 --> 15:08.465
There are a million
pages in there.

15:08.516 --> 15:09.600
She'll never know.

15:09.667 --> 15:12.770
The point is, whoever
wrote down this spell

15:12.837 --> 15:15.522
was practicing a different kind
of magic than ours.

15:15.607 --> 15:17.775
Maybe the kind
that doesn't need

15:17.842 --> 15:19.610
5 other people
to hold hands with.

15:19.677 --> 15:22.613
Well, I've never heard of
any of these ingredients.

15:22.680 --> 15:25.065
It's out of our realm
of witchcraft.

15:25.133 --> 15:29.103
Most of them are used in ancient
voodoo practices.

15:29.170 --> 15:31.354
And how are we
supposed to find them?

15:31.406 --> 15:33.407
I looked up
voodoo Botanica

15:33.491 --> 15:35.525
within a 50-mile radius
of Chance Harbor

15:35.577 --> 15:38.712
and this is the only
thing that popped up.

15:38.797 --> 15:40.380
"Lee LaBeque.

15:40.448 --> 15:44.635
Love spells, hexing spells,
oils, herbs, snake handling."

15:44.702 --> 15:46.804
This is ridiculous.
I'm desperate.

15:46.871 --> 15:49.706
If anyone is supposed
to have any power here, it's me.

15:49.758 --> 15:52.326
And if I'm not born
with it,

15:52.393 --> 15:55.378
there has to be
another way.

15:56.848 --> 15:58.348
Are you sure
this is Ok?

15:58.399 --> 15:59.549
Absolutely.

thrilled to meet you.

and independent girl.

think so.

you all for dinner

16:50.618 --> 16:52.202

that was your mother's favorite.

how to cook this, grandma.

All right, I will.

17:19.290 --> 17:20.858
How's your grandmother,
Cassie?

17:20.925 --> 17:23.460
I talked to her tonight.
She, uh, she sounded better.

17:23.545 --> 17:26.296
I'm hoping that she's
just overworked and tired.

17:26.381 --> 17:29.833

affected us all.

in the bottle.

sharing things with her

that everyone knows,

23:37.935 --> 23:39.586
Concentrate on something
you really want to have happen

23:39.653 --> 23:41.788
and it will.

23:41.839 --> 23:44.040
Yeah, we'll do that.

23:44.108 --> 23:46.009
[Clears throat]

24:01.692 --> 24:03.443
[Door closes]

24:09.533 --> 24:11.701
[Gasps]

24:23.164 --> 24:26.082
Might try something warm.

24:26.167 --> 24:28.635
Help you sleep.

24:34.342 --> 24:36.059
You're troubled.

24:36.143 --> 24:40.146
You have dark magic,
Cassie Blake.

24:42.883 --> 24:44.884
You can sense that?

24:44.935 --> 24:47.253
Of course.

24:49.390 --> 24:51.858
Your magic scares you.

24:51.909 --> 24:53.610
People keep telling me
it's dark,

24:53.694 --> 24:55.929
but I don't even know
what that means.

25:08.376 --> 25:10.593
You have darkness
in your blood.

25:10.678 --> 25:13.330
I'd hoped that you'd followed
your mother's lineage,

25:13.397 --> 25:15.965
but you are also
your father's child.

25:16.083 --> 25:17.417
What do you know
about him?

25:17.468 --> 25:19.769
I know that he had
the same dark magic

25:19.854 --> 25:24.591
and the same potential
for evil.

25:24.659 --> 25:27.110
The people who knew
your father

25:27.178 --> 25:31.698
said that bit by bit
the darkness took him over.

25:32.750 --> 25:35.151
He allowed it to.

25:38.956 --> 25:42.108
I don't want
to hurt anyone.

25:45.396 --> 25:47.213
Can I stop it?

25:47.281 --> 25:49.332
We can draw it
out of you.

25:49.417 --> 25:52.886
We can rid you of its power
before it takes hold of you.

25:52.953 --> 25:53.970
How?

25:54.038 --> 25:57.490
There's a spell.

25:57.558 --> 25:59.142
Ok. Please.

25:59.226 --> 26:01.978
You have to do it. I don't
want to hurt anyone again.

26:02.063 --> 26:03.680
I'll do anything.

26:03.748 --> 26:05.732
[Kettle whistles]

26:09.767 --> 26:12.134
We can't just go around outing
ourselves to people,

26:12.139 --> 26:14.007
especially the elders.
It's dangerous.

26:14.091 --> 26:15.508
I didn't.

26:15.593 --> 26:17.760
She knew.
She sensed it.

26:17.811 --> 26:19.295
Does she know about me?

26:19.346 --> 26:21.064
I don't think so.

26:21.131 --> 26:23.399
Believe me, I wish
she didn't know about anything.

26:23.467 --> 26:26.936
It's creepy that she
could practically smell it on me.

26:26.987 --> 26:28.238
Um.

26:28.305 --> 26:30.106
I'm sorry.

26:30.157 --> 26:32.975
I can't imagine
what you're going through.

26:33.027 --> 26:34.994
She said she has
to do the ceremony

26:35.079 --> 26:37.780
in a special part of the forest
near Harbor Woods.

26:37.831 --> 26:39.532
Do you know it?
Yes.

26:39.617 --> 26:42.485
I wish I could
come with you.

26:42.536 --> 26:45.288
I just, I don't know
what to do.

26:45.339 --> 26:48.841
My grandmother is the most
amazing woman I've ever known.

26:48.926 --> 26:52.912
And if she says she can
help you, I believe it.

26:52.980 --> 26:54.664
You can trust her.

27:04.341 --> 27:05.441
Where you headed?

27:05.509 --> 27:07.894
Oh, I'm just going out.

27:07.978 --> 27:09.479
With Nancy Collier.

27:09.530 --> 27:12.065
I left you two
something to eat.

27:17.788 --> 27:19.956
[Door closes]

27:30.801 --> 27:32.302
Don't stand so close.

27:32.369 --> 27:35.305
I want to make sure
I'm the only one doing the spell.

27:36.640 --> 27:40.510
Fine.

27:41.729 --> 27:43.229
Don't even look,

27:43.314 --> 27:44.931
just to be safe.

27:49.653 --> 27:52.021
Shatter.

27:53.741 --> 27:55.408
Shatter.

27:55.492 --> 27:57.910
What's happening?
Nothing yet.

27:59.730 --> 28:01.347
Shatter.

28:03.066 --> 28:04.901
Shatter!

28:04.969 --> 28:07.387
Come on.

28:11.425 --> 28:13.209
I'm an idiot.

28:13.260 --> 28:15.261
It happens.
You know, forget it.

28:15.346 --> 28:17.513
I'm not just gonna
forget it.

28:17.581 --> 28:20.550
Come on, let's go show this guy
what real magic looks like.

28:20.601 --> 28:22.802
That sounds like
a really bad idea.

28:22.886 --> 28:27.757
Melissa, here's what you
have to understand.

28:27.808 --> 28:29.609
Some things can be
really bad

28:29.693 --> 28:31.661
and really good
at the same time.

28:31.729 --> 28:34.147
Let's go.
Come on.

28:34.231 --> 28:37.116
Look, Faye, I really appreciate
you kicking my ass

28:37.201 --> 28:38.401
back into the real world.

28:38.452 --> 28:39.869
I needed it.
You were right.

28:39.936 --> 28:44.290
But the truth is, I'm not just
gonna follow you around anymore.

28:44.375 --> 28:47.593
I make my own decisions
and I don't want to go.

28:50.381 --> 28:52.632
No need
for big drama.

28:52.716 --> 28:55.284
I'll just let you know
how it all turns out.

[Door closes]

29:13.604 --> 29:15.438
This is it?

Yes. It's back there.

29:23.864 --> 29:26.416
Sure you're ready
for this?

29:27.484 --> 29:30.503
Yeah, I am.

the right thing to do.

Oh, my God.

You've been busy.

30:25.259 --> 30:28.227
The sooner we confront
your dark magic,

30:28.312 --> 30:31.898
the safer you and the people
around you will be.

30:31.982 --> 30:35.050
We stand on either side
of the altar.

30:39.640 --> 30:41.491
What does
this symbol mean?

30:41.558 --> 30:44.560
The quartered circle
represents mother earth.

30:44.628 --> 30:47.363
We call on her to purge you
of your darkness.

30:47.431 --> 30:49.482
Are you sure this is
even gonna work?

30:49.550 --> 30:51.717
I know it's the best
chance you have.

30:51.785 --> 30:54.921
My role is to bring
the elements together.

30:55.005 --> 30:57.907
It's you who will determine
the spell's success.

30:57.975 --> 30:59.058
How?

30:59.126 --> 31:03.629
Faith in who you are.

31:03.714 --> 31:06.349
And who you want to be.

31:08.969 --> 31:10.603
Ok.

31:10.687 --> 31:12.438
Good.

the middle of the circle.

may you purge her clean.

Elderberry.

It's also known
as the death tree.

Death tree?

We need it to finish
the spell.

32:46.319 --> 32:48.571
Adam, I think
Cassie's in trouble.

32:48.655 --> 32:49.789
What? What happened?

32:49.856 --> 32:51.290
My grandmother
sensed her dark magic.

32:51.357 --> 32:52.875
She told Cassie
they could do a ritual

32:52.959 --> 32:54.543
to get rid of it,
but she's lying.

32:54.628 --> 32:57.630
I found this in her bag.

32:57.714 --> 32:59.381
Mandrake root.

32:59.466 --> 33:00.966
A plant that can
kill witches.

33:01.034 --> 33:02.885
This is what the witch hunters
put in those bottles.

33:02.969 --> 33:04.970
We need to find
Cassie.

33:12.279 --> 33:13.929
What's going on?

33:14.014 --> 33:16.565
I think you're right
about my mother.

She claims to be having
dinner with someone

33:18.668 --> 33:19.868
I know is out of town.

33:19.903 --> 33:23.506
I called the husband,
the wife was still away.

33:23.573 --> 33:25.057
Do you know where she is
right now?

33:25.108 --> 33:26.258
No.

33:26.326 --> 33:27.977
But I'm going to talk to her
when she gets back.

33:28.044 --> 33:30.079
Talk to her?

33:30.163 --> 33:31.964
I think we're way
passed that, Charles.

33:34.084 --> 33:36.919
Give me the crystal.
I'll deal with it.

33:37.003 --> 33:38.087
No.

33:38.171 --> 33:39.839
Charles.
I said no.

Give me
the damn crystal.

Or what?

33:44.361 --> 33:46.545
We're done
at the moment.

Wait a minute.

Charles, you're upset.

We'll talk this out,

if you want.

For darkness
to be destroyed,

the earth must
bleed it from you.

magic die with you.

but it goes on for miles.

anywhere along it.

Let...Me...Out!

36:48.144 --> 36:50.479
Diana: Cassie!

36:53.433 --> 36:55.567
Are you all right?

36:57.987 --> 36:59.861
I don't know.

37:07.104 --> 37:08.522
Oh, Charles.

37:08.573 --> 37:10.290
You startled me.

37:10.358 --> 37:12.592
Nancy Collier
is in New England.

37:12.660 --> 37:14.027
Where were you tonight?

37:14.095 --> 37:15.529
You don't need
to know.

37:15.596 --> 37:17.447
What have you done,
mother?

37:19.000 --> 37:21.201
I tried to kill
Cassie Blake.

37:21.252 --> 37:23.336
You're not serious.

37:23.404 --> 37:24.404
I am.

37:24.472 --> 37:27.357
But her magic was
more powerful than mine

37:27.425 --> 37:29.009
and she survived.

37:29.076 --> 37:30.644
It was quite something.

37:30.711 --> 37:32.012
She's a child.

37:32.079 --> 37:33.830
She's John Blackwell's
daughter.

37:33.898 --> 37:36.950
I had to find out how
powerful her magic was.

37:37.018 --> 37:38.001
You were testing her?

37:38.069 --> 37:39.502
Bringing her to
the brink of death

37:39.570 --> 37:41.788
was the only way
I could be sure.

37:41.856 --> 37:43.857
She is the one we've
been waiting for--

37:43.925 --> 37:46.610
strong enough to tip the
balance between good and evil.

37:46.677 --> 37:48.028
That's barbaric.

37:48.095 --> 37:51.014
Desperate times call for
desperate measures.

37:51.082 --> 37:53.817
Well, the elders will need
to hear about this,

37:53.901 --> 37:56.036
and they will.
No, they won't.

37:56.103 --> 37:58.471
I know that you're involved in
Henry Chamberlain's death

37:58.539 --> 38:02.108
and Jane's demise.

38:02.176 --> 38:06.246
Everyone's magic leaves
its own unique imprint on it

38:06.314 --> 38:08.048
and I know yours.

38:08.115 --> 38:10.383
I have ever since
you started practicing.

38:10.451 --> 38:12.218
How could I have been
using magic,

38:12.286 --> 38:13.753
you stripped us
of our power.

38:13.804 --> 38:17.007
Don't insult me.
I'm not stupid.

38:19.226 --> 38:20.627
Be careful, Charles.

38:20.678 --> 38:22.212
You have
a good heart,

38:22.280 --> 38:23.897
but you're weak.

38:23.964 --> 38:27.484
You give in to temptation,
you always have.

38:27.568 --> 38:31.605
I make my own decisions.

38:33.107 --> 38:35.108
Come out of
the darkness.

38:35.159 --> 38:38.228
Otherwise you'll be
lost to me,

38:38.296 --> 38:40.981
to Diana,

38:41.048 --> 38:42.832
to yourself.

38:52.343 --> 38:53.760
Aah! Liar!

38:55.296 --> 38:56.596
Uhh!

38:57.798 --> 38:59.983
Hey.

39:00.051 --> 39:01.768
You've got some
anger issues, huh?

39:01.835 --> 39:04.354
Douchebag issues, but I'm
feeling much better now.

39:04.438 --> 39:05.472
Thanks.

39:05.523 --> 39:06.890
I know
what you are.

39:06.974 --> 39:08.725
You're a fortune teller
now, too.

39:08.809 --> 39:10.527
You're a witch.

39:14.181 --> 39:17.016
Obviously I'm not the
voodoo priest I claim to be.

39:17.068 --> 39:18.368
Yeah, I noticed.

39:18.452 --> 39:19.852
But my grandparents
were.

39:19.904 --> 39:22.489
And I've been around
enough magic to know it's real.

39:22.540 --> 39:24.407
But you're obviously having
trouble accessing your power

39:24.492 --> 39:26.242
or you wouldn't have
come to me.

39:27.511 --> 39:29.295
I can help you
with that.

39:29.363 --> 39:32.849
Really?
For how much?

39:32.917 --> 39:34.417
I think we can
arrange something

39:34.502 --> 39:37.070
that will benefit
the both of us.

39:37.138 --> 39:39.756
[Music playing]

39:40.874 --> 39:42.759
I told you you could
trust my grandmother.

39:42.843 --> 39:44.594
I'm so sorry.

39:44.662 --> 39:47.013
You don't have to
apologize.

39:47.064 --> 39:49.683
I believed her, too.

39:50.735 --> 39:51.718
I never thought
I'd say this,

39:51.769 --> 39:54.554
but I'm glad she's gone.

39:54.588 --> 39:56.573
I hope forever.

40:01.579 --> 40:05.031
What did it feel like?

40:06.500 --> 40:09.352
It was horrible.

40:09.420 --> 40:12.072
I thought for sure
I was gonna die.

40:13.307 --> 40:14.491
I can't imagine.

40:14.558 --> 40:20.630
I've never felt fear
like that before.

40:20.698 --> 40:22.549
The panic.

40:22.600 --> 40:27.253
It just, it...

40:27.321 --> 40:30.490
It flooded through
my entire body.

40:30.558 --> 40:35.779
Then...Erupted.

40:40.117 --> 40:43.102
The scary part is...

40:45.906 --> 40:48.825
I liked it.

40:48.909 --> 40:51.611
Liked what?

40:56.133 --> 40:58.668
The feeling
of power.

40:58.736 --> 41:02.756
Destroying the box that was
sucking the life out of me,

41:02.807 --> 41:04.123
blowing away
the earth.

41:04.175 --> 41:08.728
It was smothering me
and letting my fear save me.

41:08.796 --> 41:11.164
I know that
it isn't right,

41:11.232 --> 41:13.683
but it felt
really good.

41:13.768 --> 41:16.436
And I guess...

41:16.487 --> 41:19.639
If I didn't have this,

41:19.690 --> 41:22.525
I'd be dead right now.

41:23.778 --> 41:27.247
Just how powerful are you?

41:27.849 --> 41:31.349
