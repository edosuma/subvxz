01:05.197 --> 01:07.189
D'oh!

01:08.902 --> 01:10.836
- Whee!
- <i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

01:10.937 --> 01:12.905
- Ya-haa!
- <i>Yee- Oh! D'oh!</i>

01:24.184 --> 01:29.121
# Happy first "A"
Bart Simpson #

01:29.222 --> 01:32.589
# Happy first "A" #

01:32.692 --> 01:36.059
#To you ##

01:36.162 --> 01:38.494
- Hey!
- Yes!

01:38.598 --> 01:40.122
Thank you. Thank you.

01:40.233 --> 01:42.565
Now that our son
is an honor student...

01:42.669 --> 01:44.660
I'm going to get one of
those bumper stickers...

01:44.771 --> 01:47.035
that informs strangers
of that fact.

01:47.140 --> 01:50.576
Just a cotton-pickin' minute.
I've been getting A's since Gymboree.

01:50.677 --> 01:53.043
- What do you want? A medal?
- You gave Bart one.

01:53.146 --> 01:56.343
<i>Love you.</i>

01:56.449 --> 02:00.442
An "A" in astronomy.
How'd you do it?

02:00.553 --> 02:02.487
I just buckled down
and studied.

02:02.589 --> 02:04.887
- No, really.
- Well...

02:04.991 --> 02:08.551
it all started last week
in Krabappel's class.

02:10.763 --> 02:13.129
<i>I was trying to breed</i>
<i>the hamster with the lizard...</i>

02:13.233 --> 02:15.201
<i>to create an unholy</i>
<i>supercreature...</i>

02:15.301 --> 02:19.431
<i>when I saw an even worse crime</i>
<i>against nature.</i>

02:23.009 --> 02:24.909
Ah, head lice
inspection day.

02:25.011 --> 02:28.640
While the kids are out getting their nits picked,
we can have our own private "cootie call."

02:28.748 --> 02:32.980
- Oh, you talk too much.
Let's do it on Martin's desk.
- It is usually the cleanest.

02:37.123 --> 02:40.320
Oh!
- <i>I needed to get</i>
<i>my mind on something else.</i>

02:40.426 --> 02:45.329
<i>Anything else. And for the first time</i>
<i>in my life, education was the answer.</i>

02:45.431 --> 02:49.197
- "Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars-"
- <i>Come on, Edna. Don't be tardy!</i>

02:49.302 --> 02:53.671
"Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto."

02:53.773 --> 02:57.709
So when I took the test,
the answers were stuck in my brain.

02:57.810 --> 03:01.871
- It was like a whole different kind of cheating.
- Well, we couldn't be prouder.

03:01.981 --> 03:05.109
Excuse me, sir.
Your credit card has been rejected.

03:05.218 --> 03:08.710
Deadbeat. Deadbeat. Deadbeat.
- Oh, how embarrassing.

03:08.821 --> 03:12.018
Well, let me just give you
one of my many other valid-

03:12.125 --> 03:13.888
Run!

03:13.993 --> 03:16.154
#They're getting away #

03:16.262 --> 03:19.823
# Stop them, Mary Kay ##

03:24.404 --> 03:27.635
Okay. So we can't pay for
your precious food.

03:27.740 --> 03:29.708
What are you gonna
do about it?

03:29.809 --> 03:32.209
<i># Ba la bamba #</i>

03:32.312 --> 03:34.678
<i># Ba la bamba ##</i>

03:38.618 --> 03:41.587
- Can we go now?
- No, no.

03:41.688 --> 03:44.156
Your playing, while technically
proficient, lacks passion.

03:44.257 --> 03:47.454
Fine. You want passion?
I'll give you passion.

03:47.560 --> 03:50.028
# Blue #

03:50.129 --> 03:53.997
# Spanish eyes #

03:54.100 --> 03:59.868
#Teardrops are falling
from your Spanish eyes ##

04:02.609 --> 04:04.702
When did this happen?

04:04.811 --> 04:08.338
When did we become
the bottom rung of society?

04:08.448 --> 04:11.474
I think it was when that cold snap
killed off all the hoboes.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.609
Dad, what happened to
the backseat?

04:13.720 --> 04:15.745
I had to sell it
for gas money.

04:18.958 --> 04:21.255
Which I spent
on a novelty horn.

04:23.363 --> 04:26.264
Maybe we should talk to
a financial planner.

04:26.366 --> 04:28.994
Financial panther, eh?

04:30.470 --> 04:33.166
Mr. Simpson,
you're a dollar overdrawn.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.241
Get him, Sheba!

04:35.341 --> 04:37.935
I'm on board.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.474
<i>You haven't set aside</i>
anything <i>for the future.</i>

04:41.581 --> 04:45.108
You know how it is with cops.
I'll get shot three days before retirement.

04:45.218 --> 04:48.654
- In the business we call it "retirony."
- What if you don't get shot?

04:48.755 --> 04:53.454
What a terrible thing to say.
Now, look. You made my wife cry.

04:53.559 --> 04:56.926
Well, I see you have
several mortgages...

04:57.030 --> 05:00.295
credit card debt, no savings,
and you're supporting your father?

05:00.400 --> 05:03.995
- Just give the word, and I'll cut him off.
- I couldn't ask you to do that.

05:04.103 --> 05:06.230
- Consider it done.
- Based on these figures...

05:06.339 --> 05:08.967
I'm afraid you'll need to
declare bankruptcy... several times.

05:09.075 --> 05:10.975
Just look at
this projection.

05:14.881 --> 05:18.681
<i>Marge, your posture looks terrible.</i>

05:18.785 --> 05:22.983
What's interesting is you'll continue
losing money even after you're dead.

05:23.089 --> 05:25.557
<i>Your grave sites will go</i>
<i>untended and vandalized.</i>

05:25.658 --> 05:27.717
Ha-ha!

05:27.827 --> 05:31.388
Mr. Simpson, your intelligence profile
indicates that you're too...

05:31.497 --> 05:33.397
"stupid" to stick to a budget.

05:33.499 --> 05:35.865
- Yes. Go on.
- So, let me put this simply.

05:35.968 --> 05:38.493
- You need more money.
- But how do I get it?

05:38.604 --> 05:42.438
- I'm a financial planner, not a financial consultant.
- <i>Sorry.</i>

05:42.542 --> 05:44.442
Now I'd like my fee, please.

05:46.679 --> 05:49.978
I know you're not a deaf-mute, Mr. Simpson.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.051
We've been talking
for the last 20 minutes.

05:53.586 --> 05:55.577
Aaah!

05:59.258 --> 06:01.920
Sir, I have a small
personal request.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.189
Oh, of course, Smithers.
Anything.

06:06.332 --> 06:09.699
I disabled the button, sir.
Anyway, I need some time off.

06:09.802 --> 06:12.930
As you know, I've been writing a musical
about the Malibu Stacy doll.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.769
A show about a doll?

06:15.875 --> 06:20.175
Why not write a musical about
the common cat or the king of Siam?

06:20.279 --> 06:22.179
Give it up, Smithers.

06:22.281 --> 06:24.943
Actually, sir, we've been booked into
a small theater in New Mexico.

06:25.051 --> 06:29.579
Whoa. Whoa. Slow down there, maestro.
There's a <i>new</i> Mexico?

06:29.689 --> 06:33.716
Yes. I want to go there and make my dream
come true. I'll just be gone for a week.

06:33.826 --> 06:37.318
Oh, fine.
I can amuse myself.

06:37.430 --> 06:39.295
Curses. It's jammed.

06:40.566 --> 06:42.864
Hi-larious!

06:45.671 --> 06:50.131
Well, with the old ball and chain gone, maybe
I can finally have a little fun at the office.

06:52.545 --> 06:54.479
Ah! A candy shop.

06:54.580 --> 06:57.208
Yes. I'll take two pounds
of Bristol's toffee.

06:57.316 --> 07:00.285
Oh, and don't wrap it too tightly.
I'm hungry now.

07:02.955 --> 07:06.254
You've made a powerful enemy today,
my friend.

07:09.328 --> 07:12.491
Wow. I never seen you
have so many lunch beers before, Homer.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.793
Oh, I... concur.

07:14.901 --> 07:17.836
Word-a-day Calendar.

07:17.937 --> 07:21.395
I'm just trying to work up
the courage to ask Burns for a raise.

07:21.507 --> 07:23.737
Or a highly paid internship.

07:23.843 --> 07:26.243
Something to solve
my money woes.

07:27.547 --> 07:30.573
Hmm. This must be
some sort of cafetorium.

07:30.683 --> 07:34.210
Here's your chance, Homer.
Mr. Burns just...

07:34.320 --> 07:36.220
<i>entered</i> the room.

07:37.690 --> 07:39.214
Hmm.

07:40.893 --> 07:43.589
What is this?

07:43.696 --> 07:46.358
Some kind of force field
around these vegetables.

07:46.466 --> 07:50.994
That's the sneeze guard. You have to lean
under it to get salad or sneeze on stuff.

07:51.103 --> 07:54.937
Ah. Everything's
so green and alive.

07:57.276 --> 08:00.541
Mr. Burns, I was wondering
if I could get a raise.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.739
What kind of a raise?

08:02.849 --> 08:04.874
- Whopping?
- I see.

08:04.984 --> 08:07.612
You have 30 seconds
to wow me.

08:07.720 --> 08:10.746
Well, sir-You see, sir,
I've worked here a long time...

08:10.857 --> 08:12.757
and my wife has a game leg.

08:12.859 --> 08:14.827
And my kids have
game things as well.

08:14.927 --> 08:17.225
I don't want to hear your whining.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.925
I'm a bored and joyless old man.
Give me a "larf."

08:21.033 --> 08:24.161
A " larf'? Okay.
Let's see what's in the news today.

08:24.270 --> 08:26.397
Oh, for the love of-

08:26.506 --> 08:29.964
- Hurl this at that.
- At Lenny? But he's a war hero.

08:30.076 --> 08:32.510
- Well, let's decorate him then.
- No!

08:32.611 --> 08:36.139
Not even for... four dollars?

08:36.249 --> 08:39.775
Ow! My eye! I'm not supposed to
get pudding in it!

08:41.153 --> 08:44.179
That was capital.
My lung is aching.

08:44.290 --> 08:46.190
I liked when I threw
the pudding.

08:46.292 --> 08:48.317
Do it again.
I'll make it an even eight.

08:48.427 --> 08:51.726
- You're the boss.
- Ow! I'm in hell!

08:54.367 --> 08:56.426
Let's keep the laughs coming,
eh, Simpson?

08:56.536 --> 08:59.972
What say I make you
my executive in charge of recreation?

09:00.072 --> 09:03.064
No. No. Better yet,
my prank monkey.

09:03.175 --> 09:07.373
- Will you keep giving me money?
- I can't have my little monkey
running around in rags.

09:07.480 --> 09:10.005
- Whoo-hoo!
- Hey!

09:10.116 --> 09:13.643
What are you doing, man?
That's Carl!

09:13.753 --> 09:16.347
Let me help you.

09:16.455 --> 09:18.446
There.

09:22.995 --> 09:25.896
<i>All right, prank monkey. Let's make mischief.</i>

09:25.998 --> 09:28.364
Ninety-eight...

09:28.467 --> 09:30.867
ninety-nine,
one hundred.

09:30.970 --> 09:34.462
Oh, if only the real chicks
went down this easy.

09:34.574 --> 09:38.840
Look at that comic book fellow
calmly eating candy like a Spaniard.

09:38.945 --> 09:41.675
Time for monkey to shine.

09:44.050 --> 09:47.816
I'd like to buy a mint condition
<i>Spider-Man</i> number one, please.

09:47.920 --> 09:51.048
And I'd like an hour on the holodeck
with Seven of Nine.

09:52.158 --> 09:54.820
<i>Oh! Saturn's rings!</i>

09:54.927 --> 09:56.895
Let me get that for you.

10:07.506 --> 10:09.474
Paper bag or triple Mylar?

10:09.575 --> 10:12.066
Uh, no, thanks.
I'll just eat it here.

10:12.178 --> 10:14.942
Oh! No!
What are you doing?

10:15.047 --> 10:17.572
Good, fair, poor!

10:25.691 --> 10:28.819
Ah, that was uproarious.
First-rate job, monkey.

10:28.928 --> 10:32.796
- Do I get paid now?
- Oh, where are my manners?

10:32.898 --> 10:34.923
There.

10:35.968 --> 10:38.664
D'oh!

10:38.771 --> 10:41.035
You're so much more fun
than Smithers.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.574
Why, he doesn't know
the meaning of the word "gay."

10:46.746 --> 10:50.648
# Sold separately #

10:50.750 --> 10:55.414
# Sometimes I feel like
I've been sold #

10:55.521 --> 10:57.785
# Separately #

10:57.890 --> 10:59.790
# But out of the box #

10:59.892 --> 11:03.953
# I find you poseable #

11:04.063 --> 11:07.328
# Lovable #

11:07.433 --> 11:13.167
#Just like me ##

11:16.108 --> 11:18.338
This is better
than a movie... why?

11:24.116 --> 11:26.175
Okay, now!

11:26.285 --> 11:28.685
<i>Little help?</i>
<i>Little help, please.</i>

11:28.788 --> 11:30.756
I made a boom-boom.

11:30.856 --> 11:32.756
- Oh, gross!
- Not where I pee!

11:32.858 --> 11:34.758
Get that out of here!

11:34.860 --> 11:38.227
The line in the ladies' room is far too long.
I hope you don't mind- Oh!

11:38.330 --> 11:40.195
Baby made a boom-boom.

11:40.299 --> 11:43.325
Oh, good heavens! Oh!

11:43.436 --> 11:46.098
Here you go, monkey.

11:48.140 --> 11:50.040
Ow!

11:50.142 --> 11:53.270
There. That's six years' worth of inoculations.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.279
Here you are,
my good man.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.906
And while you're at it,
throw in one of those polio shots.

11:58.017 --> 11:59.917
Ooh, yes, sir.

12:00.019 --> 12:03.420
<i>Ah-Anti-polio.</i>

12:04.990 --> 12:07.515
Homie, where did you get
that ball of money?

12:07.626 --> 12:10.959
I've been doing some
outside projects for Mr. Burns.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.531
- Really? Like what?
- Ah, you know.

12:13.632 --> 12:15.793
Business stuff.
Uh, downsizing...

12:15.901 --> 12:18.131
e-solutions,
the glass ceiling.

12:18.237 --> 12:22.264
Hmm. Well,
I'm proud of you. Mmm.

12:22.374 --> 12:25.400
You're such a good provider.
Kids, come on.

12:25.511 --> 12:28.537
- Thank your father for the injections.
- Thank you, Dad.

12:38.224 --> 12:41.250
- Hey, Dad. Can I have some money
for a panda cone?
- Gah!

12:41.360 --> 12:44.591
What do you do with the $68
I send your mother every month?

12:44.697 --> 12:47.131
Weekday Dad
wanted a DVD player.

12:48.234 --> 12:50.532
<i>Look at their</i>
<i>proud, hopeful faces.</i>

12:50.636 --> 12:53.605
Wait till they see
that their rare Chinese panda...

12:53.706 --> 12:55.674
is nothing but
a fat guy in a suit.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.675
Why do I have to do
the Lindy Hop?

12:57.777 --> 12:59.802
Oh, that's the heart
of the bit.

13:02.515 --> 13:07.043
Now, courtesy of an anonymous donor,
please welcome our new panda, Sim Sim.

13:07.153 --> 13:09.314
Yea!

13:09.421 --> 13:12.390
<i>Don't be shy.</i>
<i>That-a-girl.</i>

13:12.491 --> 13:14.425
<i>Oh, I think</i>
<i>she's getting ready to-</i>

13:14.527 --> 13:16.620
<i>Yeah. She's doing</i>
<i>the Lindy Hop.</i>

13:16.729 --> 13:19.789
That's it.
Twenty-three skiddoo, 24...

13:19.899 --> 13:21.799
<i>25 skiddoo.</i>

13:25.004 --> 13:28.405
Well, it looks like Sim Sim
is a little frisky today.

13:28.507 --> 13:30.873
<i>So our trainers</i>
<i>are gonna calm her down.</i>

13:30.976 --> 13:32.034
Huh?

13:32.144 --> 13:34.305
Ow!

13:34.413 --> 13:37.780
- Aaah!
- Don't worry, folks. Because of
their thick, thick hides...

13:37.883 --> 13:41.751
pandas only feel the slightest tickle
from these powerful electric shocks.

13:41.854 --> 13:44.379
Ow!

13:46.759 --> 13:49.227
Ohh. She's saying
"I love you."

13:49.328 --> 13:50.955
Yea!

13:51.063 --> 13:55.193
Can't... take...
the pain. Ow!

13:55.301 --> 13:58.464
Yea!

13:58.571 --> 14:02.769
- Sim Sim likes to boogie.
- Something's wrong- terribly wrong.

14:02.875 --> 14:05.742
Hey, there's our resident
bull panda, Ping Ping.

14:05.845 --> 14:11.477
<i>With any luck, folks, these two will become</i>
<i>very, very close, if you know what I mean.</i>

14:13.219 --> 14:16.279
Huh? Help!
Mr. Burns!

14:18.591 --> 14:20.286
Aaah!

14:20.392 --> 14:24.260
Oh, look. She's presenting.
We thought this would take years to happen.

14:30.636 --> 14:32.934
Ping Ping just asked
Sim Sim to marry him...

14:33.038 --> 14:35.336
and I think
she just said yes.

14:35.441 --> 14:37.739
Aw.

14:42.815 --> 14:45.181
Ha! You ain't goin'
nowhere, cutie.

15:03.936 --> 15:06.461
Am I glad to see you guys.
You gotta call-

15:09.375 --> 15:12.344
Dad? The panda was you?

15:12.444 --> 15:15.311
Did you see Daddy dance?

15:15.414 --> 15:17.939
They all saw me dance.

15:18.050 --> 15:20.143
Oh, Dad.

15:24.223 --> 15:27.624
So this is your mysterious
new job for Mr. Burns.

15:27.726 --> 15:33.460
Yes. I humiliate myself for fistfuls of cash.

15:33.565 --> 15:35.430
Oh, Dad,
you have to stop.

15:35.534 --> 15:38.765
- I know.
- <i>Well done, monkey.</i>

15:38.871 --> 15:42.307
That other panda gave some
unexpected 'zazz to the festivities, eh?

15:42.408 --> 15:45.070
Maybe for you. How come
you didn't rescue me?

15:45.177 --> 15:48.613
Too busy trying to keep my sides from splitting.

15:48.714 --> 15:50.875
It's happened before.

15:50.983 --> 15:53.918
Monty say, monkey do.
What could be better?

15:54.019 --> 15:57.887
- Well, you could treat me with a little respect.
- Oh, shut up, you tub of guts.

15:57.990 --> 15:59.890
See? That's what I'm saying.

15:59.992 --> 16:03.018
Well, a little do-re-mi
will smooth this over.

16:03.128 --> 16:05.119
He doesn't want
your dirty money.

16:05.230 --> 16:08.097
Oh, come now.
Everyone has his price.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.100
- Not my dad.
- Shh, shh.

16:10.202 --> 16:12.636
The grown-ups
are talking, honey.

16:12.738 --> 16:16.003
- Dad, how can you put a price on your dignity?
- She's right.

16:16.108 --> 16:18.838
Yes, I may be naked
and reeking of panda love...

16:18.944 --> 16:22.175
but I've got to stop this
before it goes too far.

16:22.281 --> 16:25.546
Take that back...
for $903.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.812
- I retract my statement.
- Ha!

16:27.920 --> 16:30.514
- Dad.
- I mean, screw you!

16:30.622 --> 16:34.786
Well, well. It looks like my monkey
has evolved into a man.

16:35.861 --> 16:37.385
A poor man.

16:37.496 --> 16:41.830
Wha- Oh, why did he have to
say that extra thing?

16:41.934 --> 16:44.698
Forget about him, Dad.
I'm proud of you.

16:44.803 --> 16:47.135
Aw, thank you, sweetheart.

16:47.239 --> 16:50.367
But what should I do with all this dirty,
ill-gotten money?

16:50.476 --> 16:52.410
I better throw it
in the garbage.

16:52.511 --> 16:54.638
Well, there's lots of
needy kids out there.

16:54.747 --> 16:57.580
I see what you're saying.
I need to buy a gun.

16:57.683 --> 17:02.143
No, Dad. You could really brighten
the holidays for those less fortunate.

17:02.254 --> 17:06.247
Yeah, right.
It's time to rebuild my self-esteem.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.155
Hey, what happened to-

17:08.260 --> 17:10.728
Oh, good Lord!
What a week!

17:11.997 --> 17:15.454
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes?

17:15.567 --> 17:19.833
I'd like to buy all these toys
for some needy children.

17:19.938 --> 17:22.065
Is this enough
dirty, dirty money?

17:24.410 --> 17:27.675
Why, it most certainly is!

17:27.780 --> 17:31.238
Mr. Costington, something quite
wonderful has happened.

17:31.350 --> 17:33.318
Uh, no. Uh, no.

17:33.419 --> 17:35.353
Uh, yes!

17:36.722 --> 17:39.088
Why, I don't think
I've ever seen such generosity.

17:39.191 --> 17:41.159
You're a modern day
Kriss Kringle, sir.

17:41.260 --> 17:44.286
I'm just trying to dig myself
out of a pit of shame.

17:44.396 --> 17:48.196
Say no more. I've had a bit of
a shoe-sniffing problem myself.

17:48.300 --> 17:50.962
I'm still not allowed
on the third floor.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.004
It's okay.

17:53.105 --> 17:55.073
Mr. Simpson, I just had
a crazy thought.

17:55.174 --> 17:58.041
We do a little Thanksgiving Day
parade around here...

17:58.143 --> 18:01.943
and you're about the right build
for a little fella they call Kriss Kringle.

18:02.047 --> 18:04.914
- Hold still.
- I'm so proud.

18:05.017 --> 18:08.384
My dad will be the grand finale
of the Thanksgiving Day parade.

18:08.487 --> 18:11.684
- Wanna rehearse, Dad?
- I don't need to rehearse.

18:11.790 --> 18:14.953
Ho, ho, ho! Merry-

18:15.060 --> 18:16.960
- Line.
- <i>Christmas.</i>

18:17.062 --> 18:18.962
Wha-
Let me see that.

18:19.064 --> 18:21.965
Well, looks like another beautiful
80-degree Thanksgiving Day...

18:22.067 --> 18:23.967
thanks to global warming.

18:24.069 --> 18:27.937
- Isn't that right, Leeza Gibbons?
- That's right, Kent Brockman.

18:28.040 --> 18:31.942
Our broadcast is brought to you today
by Costington's department store...

18:32.044 --> 18:33.944
the thing downtown
that's open...

18:34.046 --> 18:35.980
right next to
the men's shelter.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.052
"Rusty" <i>the Clown?</i>

18:41.153 --> 18:43.678
Ah, Springfield gets
the lamest balloons.

18:43.789 --> 18:47.088
Are you kidding?
There's Funky Winkerbean!

18:47.192 --> 18:49.660
Over here, Funky!

18:49.761 --> 18:53.754
Look, it's the Noid.
Avoid the Noid. He ruins pizzas.

18:53.866 --> 18:56.835
Hey, lady.
Santa Claus is gonna be here, right?

18:56.935 --> 19:00.132
- He just has to.
- Something tells me he is.

19:00.239 --> 19:02.901
Don't touch me!
Nothing gives you that right!

19:03.008 --> 19:06.375
- Say, Leeza. Do you like gingerbread?
- No, not really.

19:06.478 --> 19:08.378
Well, then you'll love
this next float.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.846
<i>It's an all-gingerbread</i>
<i>desk set.</i>

19:16.321 --> 19:18.346
Yea!

19:18.457 --> 19:22.359
Ho, ho, ho!
Merry everyone!

19:25.764 --> 19:28.392
<i>Ahoy hoy, St. Nick.</i>

19:28.500 --> 19:30.695
"Pranksgiving?" Uh-oh.

19:30.802 --> 19:33.066
Prepare to be boarded.

19:36.675 --> 19:39.769
What are you doing here?
I told you. I'm not your monkey anymore.

19:39.878 --> 19:42.642
Silence, monkey. Now that
you're Father Christmas...

19:42.748 --> 19:45.216
we have an opportunity
to bend this town over our knee...

19:45.317 --> 19:47.217
and give it a pranking
it will never forget.

19:47.319 --> 19:50.755
Here's what we do.

19:50.856 --> 19:55.555
Here's a float saluting the Native Americans,
who taught us how to celebrate Thanksgiving.

19:55.661 --> 19:57.686
<i>Interesting sidenote on this float:</i>

19:57.796 --> 20:01.527
<i>The papier-mâché is composed</i>
<i>entirely ofbroken treaties.</i>

20:01.633 --> 20:04.158
They're good sports.

20:04.269 --> 20:08.672
The answer is no, Mr. Burns.
Not for any amount of money.

20:08.774 --> 20:10.674
Not for one million dollars?

20:10.776 --> 20:13.973
Oh, so much money.

20:14.079 --> 20:16.445
<i>But Santa can't be evil.</i>

20:16.548 --> 20:19.016
But it's so much money.

20:19.117 --> 20:22.245
And here's the float
everyone's been waiting for.

20:22.354 --> 20:27.257
Yes. Whether you're Christian or just non-Jewish,
everybody loves Santa Claus.

20:28.594 --> 20:30.789
<i>Oh, he was supposed to be</i>
<i>throwing out toys...</i>

20:30.896 --> 20:34.127
<i>but he seems to be hurling</i>
<i>some sort of candy treats, Leeza.</i>

20:34.233 --> 20:36.599
Wait a minute, Kent.
That is not candy.

20:36.702 --> 20:38.397
<i>That's fish guts.</i>

20:40.172 --> 20:43.039
There's Santa!
Over here, Santa!

20:43.141 --> 20:45.439
What did I do?

20:45.544 --> 20:48.707
Ah, the doctor said I could take
this patch off five minutes a day.

20:48.814 --> 20:51.977
Hey, that's just enough time
to see Santy Claus.

20:52.084 --> 20:54.518
Oh! Why, Santa? Why?

20:54.620 --> 20:57.248
Oh, no.
Here come the gulls!

20:59.625 --> 21:01.752
Nice birdie.

21:01.860 --> 21:04.385
Nice birdie.
No! Not so nice!

21:04.496 --> 21:06.487
Ow!

21:08.600 --> 21:11.660
Oh, Dad.
You sold your soul.

21:11.770 --> 21:14.261
- <i>Not yet, honey.</i>
- Dad!

21:14.373 --> 21:17.433
But if you're here,
who's that on the float?

21:17.542 --> 21:19.976
Ho, ho, ho! Merry "Fishmas"!

21:20.078 --> 21:24.981
- What's going on?
- Let's just say Lisa gave me
an early Christmas present:

21:25.083 --> 21:26.983
The gift of dignity.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.798
- Shh!
- <i>Baby made a boom-boom.</i>
