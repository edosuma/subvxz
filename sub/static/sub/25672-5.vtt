05:07.530 --> 05:10.330

12:53.210 --> 12:54.500
<font size="20"><b>This is your victory.</b></font>

12:56.080 --> 12:57.200
<font size="20"><b>Aren't you happy?</b></font>

12:58.960 --> 12:59.660
<font size="20"><b>Nile.</b></font>

13:00.840 --> 13:03.110
<font size="20"><b>Humanity has just begun down a new path...</b></font>

13:03.800 --> 13:05.550
<font size="20"><b>One far more dangerous than before.</b></font>

13:24.780 --> 13:27.780
<font size="20"><b>And there you have it.
The coup d'Ã©tat was successful.</b></font>

13:28.240 --> 13:32.160
<font size="20"><b>Premier Zachary has control of
the capital and administrative district.</b></font>

13:32.700 --> 13:36.120
<font size="20"><b>For the time being, the nobility hasn't rebelled.</b></font>

13:36.120 --> 13:38.630
<font size="20"><b>What about the Boss Reeves incident?</b></font>

13:39.040 --> 13:41.840
<font size="20"><b>We got a confession that proved
the charges unfounded.</b></font>

13:42.300 --> 13:44.630
<font size="20"><b>His son Flegel really pulled through big time.</b></font>

13:44.970 --> 13:46.800
<font size="20"><b>Don't you get it?!</b></font>

13:46.800 --> 13:50.140
<font size="20"><b>The government doesn't give
a shit about saving any of us!</b></font>

13:50.140 --> 13:53.220
<font size="20"><b>Face the truth now, because it'll be
too late when you're dead!</b></font>

13:53.220 --> 13:58.980
<font size="20"><b>That's right! If Titans attack us again,
there'll be nothing left this time!</b></font>

13:58.980 --> 14:01.080
<font size="20"><b>Not the company! Not our families!</b></font>

14:01.650 --> 14:04.500
<font size="20"><b>Let's print the truth before that happens!</b></font>

14:06.110 --> 14:11.270
<font size="20"><b>Just like it's written right there, it shows the
charges were bogus, they abused their power,</b></font>

14:11.660 --> 14:14.370
<font size="20"><b>and that King Fritz was a total fake.</b></font>

14:15.200 --> 14:18.300
<font size="20"><b>All our actions were justified self-defense.</b></font>

14:18.790 --> 14:22.070
<font size="20"><b>In other words, we're free people now.</b></font>

14:26.010 --> 14:30.140
<font size="20"><b>Woohoo!</b></font>

14:30.140 --> 14:32.890
<font size="20"><b>No... This can't be...</b></font>

14:33.680 --> 14:35.500
<font size="20"><b>Looks like the gamble paid off.</b></font>

14:35.980 --> 14:36.730
<font size="20"><b>Yeah.</b></font>

14:37.480 --> 14:39.310
<font size="20"><b>It wasn't just Erwin though.</b></font>

14:40.190 --> 14:43.650
<font size="20"><b>The lone choices of many
managed to change the world.</b></font>

14:46.530 --> 14:49.580
<font size="20"><b>And I managed to kill the
three people you loaned me.</b></font>

14:50.660 --> 14:51.610
<font size="20"><b>I'm sorry.</b></font>

14:55.120 --> 14:57.630
<font size="20"><b>The thing is, part of the Interior Police,</b></font>

14:57.630 --> 15:01.840
<font size="20"><b>their leader, Eren, and Historia are somewhere else.</b></font>

15:01.840 --> 15:03.590
<font size="20"><b>If we don't find them soon...</b></font>

15:05.250 --> 15:06.910
<font size="20"><b>I may have a clue about that.</b></font>

15:08.220 --> 15:11.590
<font size="20"><b>Let's get there and put an end to this battle.</b></font>

15:11.970 --> 15:16.970
<font face="Times New Roman" size="20" color="#e9f0e8"><b>{\an3}"Information Available for Public Disclosure"
"Underground Chapel"
"A sacred location where the royal family's power has been passed down for generations. The walls are composed of a naturally luminescent ore which is thought to have been created by some form of Titan power."</b></font>

15:19.060 --> 15:21.180
<font size="20"><b>As a result of Erwin's actions,</b></font>

15:21.900 --> 15:24.830
<font size="20"><b>it was declared that the current
regime would be ousted.</b></font>

15:25.770 --> 15:28.420
<font size="20"><b>That announcement came immediately after</b></font>

15:28.420 --> 15:30.700
<font size="20"><b>the military gained control of the
capital and administrative district.</b></font>

15:31.610 --> 15:36.450
<font size="20"><b>And took place upon the gallows
constructed specifically for him.</b></font>

15:37.240 --> 15:38.040
<font size="20"><b>That's right.</b></font>

15:38.700 --> 15:42.170
<font size="20"><b>It's exactly how Premier Zachary
explained in the speech.</b></font>

15:42.170 --> 15:46.050
<font size="20"><b>Understand that our goal
is not to establish military rule.</b></font>

15:46.420 --> 15:50.510
<font size="20"><b>In place of Fritz, a new ruler will
come from the true royal family.</b></font>

15:50.510 --> 15:53.390
<font size="20"><b>They will be the one responsible
for leading the people.</b></font>

15:53.390 --> 15:55.390
<font size="20"><b>I understand that well enough,</b></font>

15:55.390 --> 15:59.810
<font size="20"><b>but do you really think people will simply
accept a new ruler just like that?</b></font>

16:00.270 --> 16:03.280
<font size="20"><b>There're a lot of citizens out
there who are very worried.</b></font>

16:03.740 --> 16:06.290
<font size="20"><b>At this point, who do we trust?</b></font>

16:08.650 --> 16:10.150
<font size="20"><b>As far as humanity's concerned,</b></font>

16:10.960 --> 16:13.470
<font size="20"><b>we should have let the government do as they please.</b></font>

16:14.660 --> 16:16.700
<font size="20"><b>Like Commander Pyxis was saying,</b></font>

16:16.700 --> 16:20.530
<font size="20"><b>they've somehow devised a means
of keeping humanity alive until now.</b></font>

16:21.290 --> 16:26.610
<font size="20"><b>Even if they watch as half of humanity dies,
it's better than us going extinct.</b></font>

16:29.590 --> 16:35.970
<font size="20"><b>Should I have let Eren go, risked my comrade's
lives, given up both my life and my duty,</b></font>

16:35.970 --> 16:38.350
<font size="20"><b>and entrusted it all to the government?</b></font>

16:38.930 --> 16:42.370
<font size="20"><b>If humanity is more precious
than one single life...</b></font>

16:46.610 --> 16:49.430
<font size="20"><b>Your duty is as painful as ever.</b></font>

16:49.940 --> 16:52.400
<font size="20"><b>Dying seems a far easier option.</b></font>

16:54.490 --> 16:58.090
<font size="20"><b>In that case, why didn't you do as you say?</b></font>

16:58.870 --> 16:59.540
<font size="20"><b>That's...</b></font>

16:59.830 --> 17:01.780
<font size="20"><b>Shall I tell you my reason?</b></font>

17:02.960 --> 17:06.040
<font size="20"><b>For a long time, I've hated those bastards!</b></font>

17:06.040 --> 17:06.700
<font size="20"><b>Huh?</b></font>

17:06.690 --> 17:08.460
<font size="20"><b>They piss me off!</b></font>

17:08.460 --> 17:11.640
<font size="20"><b>Those pompous pricks and pigs
who think they're important...</b></font>

17:11.960 --> 17:15.510
<font size="20"><b>No... Maybe I actually liked them.</b></font>

17:15.510 --> 17:18.720
<font size="20"><b>I've been dreaming for
this day to come for ages.</b></font>

17:19.050 --> 17:25.099
<font size="20"><b>That is... Even if you hadn't done it, I would've
given it a shot before I kicked the bucket.</b></font>

17:25.099 --> 17:29.870
<font size="20"><b>I couldn't care less if this coup d'Ã©tat
is good or bad for humanity.</b></font>

17:31.110 --> 17:32.690
<font size="20"><b>I'm quite the scoundrel, right?</b></font>

17:33.940 --> 17:36.510
<font size="20"><b>But you're no different than me.</b></font>

17:37.870 --> 17:40.300
<font size="20"><b>You didn't want to die.</b></font>

17:40.950 --> 17:46.160
<font size="20"><b>Just like me, you prioritize yourself
over the fate of humanity.</b></font>

17:47.500 --> 17:50.970
<font size="20"><b>I... must be very conceited to think that.</b></font>

17:51.670 --> 17:53.520
<font size="20"><b>What's your reason?</b></font>

17:54.380 --> 17:56.730
<font size="20"><b>Now it's your turn to answer.</b></font>

17:59.470 --> 18:00.570
<font size="20"><b>I...</b></font>

18:01.600 --> 18:02.770
<font size="20"><b>...have a dream.</b></font>

18:04.270 --> 18:06.270
<font size="20"><b>One I've had since I was a child...</b></font>

18:17.360 --> 18:18.240
<font size="20"><b>Hange.</b></font>

18:19.030 --> 18:21.080
<font size="20"><b>You might know where they are?</b></font>

18:21.080 --> 18:23.280
<font size="20"><b>Yeah, I'll explain.</b></font>

18:24.040 --> 18:28.120
<font size="20"><b>Erwin gave me this Scout investigation
report regarding Lord Reiss' land.</b></font>

18:28.420 --> 18:33.130
<font size="20"><b>Most of it has to do with an incident five
years ago that shook up the Reiss family.</b></font>

18:33.420 --> 18:34.510
<font size="20"><b>Five years ago?</b></font>

18:34.670 --> 18:37.910
<font size="20"><b>Right. On the day Wall Maria was breached.</b></font>

18:38.800 --> 18:41.690
<font size="20"><b>I'll summarize the important
bits from the beginning.</b></font>

18:42.260 --> 18:47.470
<font size="20"><b>As the lord of his territory, popular opinion
of Rod Reiss wasn't all that bad.</b></font>

18:48.060 --> 18:53.520
<font size="20"><b>He had five children, and his eldest
daughter Frieda was a down-to-earth girl</b></font>

18:53.520 --> 18:55.710
<font size="20"><b>that even the peasants adored.</b></font>

18:56.820 --> 19:00.070
<font size="20"><b>But that night, five years ago, disaster struck.</b></font>

19:00.700 --> 19:04.120
<font size="20"><b>With the world having plunged into pure chaos,</b></font>

19:04.120 --> 19:07.810
<font size="20"><b>some bandits raided and set fire
to the only chapel around.</b></font>

19:08.960 --> 19:14.290
<font size="20"><b>Unfortunately, that night, the entire
Reiss family was there praying together.</b></font>

19:14.960 --> 19:20.290
<font size="20"><b>And so, the whole family, save for
the head of the house, Rod Reiss...</b></font>

19:21.050 --> 19:24.010
<font size="20"><b>...was massacred that night by the bandits.</b></font>

19:26.770 --> 19:31.600
<font size="20"><b>To top it off, this incident occurred
just a few days before Historia's mother</b></font>

19:31.600 --> 19:33.610
<font size="20"><b>was killed by the Interior Police.</b></font>

19:35.650 --> 19:41.040
<font size="20"><b>In other words, immediately after losing
his family, Rod Reiss sought out Historia.</b></font>

19:41.820 --> 19:45.650
<font size="20"><b>There must be a reason he
and his lackeys are after Historia.</b></font>

19:46.740 --> 19:48.150
<font size="20"><b>The same bloodline?</b></font>

19:48.950 --> 19:51.540
<font size="20"><b>Is there some secret to their blood?</b></font>

19:51.540 --> 19:53.330
<font size="20"><b>I don't know for sure yet.</b></font>

19:53.920 --> 19:58.340
<font size="20"><b>But what really makes me curious is that
parts of the chapel are completely wrecked.</b></font>

19:59.300 --> 20:04.350
<font size="20"><b>The chapel itself is stone. It would take
tons of time and effort to destroy it.</b></font>

20:05.100 --> 20:07.960
<font size="20"><b>Bandits would take what they can
and make a quick escape.</b></font>

20:08.350 --> 20:12.320
<font size="20"><b>Plus, the only one who saw those
bandits was Rod Reiss himself.</b></font>

20:13.440 --> 20:17.420
<font size="20"><b>Soon after, he used his own
fortune to rebuild the chapel.</b></font>

20:17.940 --> 20:18.860
<font size="20"><b>But why?</b></font>

20:23.910 --> 20:29.080
<font size="20"><b>If you think about it, it's actually stranger
that there were no traces of Titans.</b></font>

20:29.660 --> 20:33.620
<font size="20"><b>Even if I'm jumping to conclusions,</b></font>

20:33.620 --> 20:36.800
<font size="20"><b>something this suspicious deserves us checking it out.</b></font>

21:01.190 --> 21:02.150
<font size="20"><b>What the hell?!</b></font>

21:12.500 --> 21:16.430
<font size="20"><b>Before the night is over,
we'll have soldiers all over Reiss' land.</b></font>

21:17.580 --> 21:20.530
<font size="20"><b>Unfortunately, I doubt
he'll be waiting that long.</b></font>

21:21.920 --> 21:26.320
<font size="20"><b>If we don't hurry and get there,
Eren may end up being eaten.</b></font>

21:29.640 --> 21:35.010
<font size="20"><b>If a Titan eats a person who can change into
a Titan and thus inherits their powers...</b></font>

21:35.940 --> 21:37.980
<font size="20"><b>If that's actually true...</b></font>

21:38.900 --> 21:44.820
<font size="20"><b>When and how did Eren become a Titan,
and who did he eat to gain his powers?</b></font>

21:51.950 --> 21:53.370
<font size="20"><b>Shit!</b></font>

22:04.880 --> 22:06.280
<font size="20"><b>Historia?</b></font>

23:40.940 --> 23:44.940
<font size="20"><b>To save Eren, Mikasa and the
others head for the Reiss chapel.</b></font>

23:45.520 --> 23:47.900
<font size="20"><b>However, the captured Eren finds out...</b></font>

23:48.490 --> 23:52.170
<font size="20"><b>...his father, Grisha's, unforgivable sin.</b></font>

23:52.990 --> 23:53.820
