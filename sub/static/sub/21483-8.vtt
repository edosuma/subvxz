WEBVTT

00:03.308 --> 00:04.074
Ellie, back up.

00:04.075 --> 00:05.172
Don't put your fingers in there.

00:05.174 --> 00:06.175
He'll bite your digits off.

00:06.177 --> 00:08.608
Why do we have to have
this thing here, anyway.

00:08.610 --> 00:10.276
It's her class pet.

00:10.278 --> 00:12.643
She might have volunteered to take
it home for Thanksgiving weekend.

00:12.645 --> 00:13.243
Ah, perfect.

00:13.245 --> 00:14.077
He has a name, guys.

00:14.079 --> 00:15.513
His name is Shakespeare.

00:15.515 --> 00:16.583
He's vermin.

00:16.585 --> 00:17.519
Can he sleep with me?

00:17.521 --> 00:18.658
Absolutely not.

00:18.660 --> 00:20.029
But he can't sleep alone.

00:20.031 --> 00:22.168
He has to sleep with somebody.

00:29.550 --> 00:30.484
Hey!

00:30.486 --> 00:31.386
What?

00:31.388 --> 00:33.287
This thing won't stop staring at me.

00:33.289 --> 00:34.389
He's not looking at you.

00:34.391 --> 00:35.056
Yes, he is.

00:35.058 --> 00:35.624
Look at him.

00:35.626 --> 00:36.491
He's looking right at me.

00:36.493 --> 00:37.692
Just put him in the kitchen.

00:37.694 --> 00:38.493
Near the food?

00:38.495 --> 00:40.561
Good God, woman, that's
how the plague started.

00:40.563 --> 00:42.563
Are you afraid of Ellie's guinea pig?

00:42.565 --> 00:44.699
No!

00:44.701 --> 00:46.967
I just don't trust it.

00:47.529 --> 00:54.121

00:54.241 --> 00:57.712
46, 47, 48...
You know, this really isn't isn't fair.

00:57.714 --> 00:59.180
I shouldn't have to
pay the whole thing.

00:59.182 --> 01:01.651
Look, the rules of the fat bet,
they are simple, they are unbending.

01:01.653 --> 01:04.658
You either put in 30 minutes of cardio a
day, or you put 50 bucks in the pot.

01:04.660 --> 01:06.059
Yes, but I'm at a disadvantage.

01:06.061 --> 01:08.263
I didn't get to sleep at all
because Ellie's fat guinea pig

01:08.265 --> 01:09.564
kept me up all night.

01:09.566 --> 01:10.599
How'd yours go, Ruxin?

01:10.601 --> 01:11.533
I ran.

01:11.535 --> 01:12.000
Mm-hmm.

01:12.002 --> 01:12.668
Bullshit, proof.

01:12.670 --> 01:14.671
You want to see my pedometer
that you make me wear?

01:14.673 --> 01:15.672
Yes.

01:15.674 --> 01:17.207
What does it say, Pete?

01:17.209 --> 01:18.442
Shit, he ran three miles.

01:18.444 --> 01:19.609
And I feel great.

01:19.611 --> 01:20.677
Got a runner's high.

01:20.679 --> 01:22.746
I just can't wait for this
whole thing to be over so I can

01:22.748 --> 01:23.613
get back to my eater's high.

01:23.615 --> 01:24.381
You mean diabetes?

01:24.383 --> 01:26.116
Whatever, it's almost over, okay?

01:26.118 --> 01:28.117
Thanksgiving is right
around the corner, buddy.

01:28.119 --> 01:29.552
You're gonna come over
for for Thanksgiving?

01:29.554 --> 01:30.687
I'm gonna eat the
shit out of some turkey.

01:30.689 --> 01:32.422
Good, 'cause that's when we're
gonna do the final weigh-in.

01:32.424 --> 01:33.356
What about me?

01:33.358 --> 01:34.557
Tommy the Turkey.

01:34.559 --> 01:37.293
I love going over to Kevin's house.

01:37.295 --> 01:38.894
Are you coming over for Thanksgiving?

01:38.896 --> 01:41.632
Nope, because my parents
think I'm going to Sofia's

01:41.634 --> 01:45.103
family's house, and Sofia's family
thinks that I'm staying home to work.

01:45.105 --> 01:49.777
I'm gonna have my house to myself, where
I can roll around my home like an

01:49.779 --> 01:52.479
anonymous man in a hotel room.

01:52.481 --> 01:53.981
Where a man is at his most base.

01:53.983 --> 01:54.715
Exactly.

01:54.717 --> 01:56.284
Pulling out Spiderman's
left and right.

01:56.286 --> 01:56.718
Yeah?

01:56.720 --> 01:58.654
When you nut in your hand, and you just...
on the window.

01:58.656 --> 02:00.990
I've been collecting those
hotel-sized moisturizer bottles

02:00.992 --> 02:01.991
just getting ready.

02:01.993 --> 02:03.961
Well, whatever you do, make
sure you don't use Sofia's

02:03.963 --> 02:06.465
Noxzema, 'cause it burns.

02:06.467 --> 02:07.666
Why would I use Noxzema?

02:07.668 --> 02:09.669
'Cause it's cold and
tingly like a girls vagina.

02:09.670 --> 02:11.404
What?

02:11.406 --> 02:12.472
Go swimming.

02:12.474 --> 02:14.441
Same thing here.

02:14.443 --> 02:17.311
Don't be eating at least an
hour before you do plyo.

02:17.313 --> 02:19.147
All right?

02:19.149 --> 02:21.415
Ladies, how's the workout going?

02:21.417 --> 02:21.916
Awful.

02:21.918 --> 02:22.683
It's horrible.

02:22.685 --> 02:23.584
Why aren't you working out?

02:23.586 --> 02:25.186
'Cause I'm going running later.

02:25.188 --> 02:27.588
I can't believe they opened a
Curves gym in your garage.

02:27.590 --> 02:28.989
Get your feet off the cage.

02:28.991 --> 02:32.359
It smells like a
Guatemalan YMCA in here.

02:32.361 --> 02:33.661
Congratulations on that.

02:33.663 --> 02:34.595
Oh, take a break.

02:34.597 --> 02:36.163
What's up?

02:36.165 --> 02:37.632
A little P90X?

02:37.634 --> 02:38.433
Bring it!

02:38.435 --> 02:39.134
Oh, God.

02:39.136 --> 02:39.968
Big news.

02:39.970 --> 02:40.969
Got a plus one for Thanksgiving.

02:40.971 --> 02:41.703
Guess who?

02:41.705 --> 02:43.339
Did you meet him on Craigslist?

02:43.341 --> 02:44.607
Are his intentions honorable?

02:44.609 --> 02:46.275
No, my sister, Heather Nowzik.

02:46.277 --> 02:47.610
Is she still pushing three bills?

02:47.612 --> 02:48.445
No, no, no, no.

02:48.447 --> 02:49.279
Got the lap band.

02:49.281 --> 02:50.380
She looks great.

02:50.382 --> 02:57.322
Andre, and I say this fondly, your
sister was such an unrelenting slutbag.

02:57.324 --> 03:00.058
All right, you know what, I think
you guys blew that out of proportion.

03:00.060 --> 03:02.294
She taught me everything I
know about going down on a woman.

03:02.296 --> 03:03.496
I didn't even go there.

03:03.498 --> 03:06.399
I never slept with her, so...
Well, you were never invited to hit it.

03:06.401 --> 03:08.969
The most promiscuous woman we
know wouldn't have sex with you.

03:08.971 --> 03:10.036
How does that feel?

03:10.038 --> 03:10.971
Facial.

03:10.973 --> 03:13.307
I'm pretty sure the facials
were going towards her, Andre.

03:13.309 --> 03:14.675
Yeah.

03:14.677 --> 03:18.512
♪ Ruxin's home alone
and he's ready to rock. ♪

03:18.514 --> 03:20.681
You nasty, Ruxin, you nasty.

03:20.683 --> 03:22.683
What do I do first?

03:22.685 --> 03:25.185
Look at porn or check my lineup?

03:25.187 --> 03:27.688
How about both?

03:27.690 --> 03:31.525
All righty.

03:31.527 --> 03:32.994
Hmm.

03:32.996 --> 03:37.698
Oh, yeah, I think I'm gonna
do about five miles today.

03:40.337 --> 03:42.671
Hello?

03:49.079 --> 03:51.180
Dad?

03:51.182 --> 03:52.715
Rodney.

03:52.717 --> 03:54.717
Everybody calls me Ruxin.

03:54.719 --> 03:55.718
Rodney.

03:55.720 --> 03:56.719
What are you doing here, Dad?

03:56.721 --> 04:01.358
Well, you know, your mom went
to spend Thanksgiving with her

04:01.360 --> 04:06.998
sister the shoplifter, and I,
as far as she's concerned, was

04:07.000 --> 04:08.299
out of town on business.

04:08.301 --> 04:11.569
I thought you were gonna be with the
conquistadors, your wife's family?

04:11.571 --> 04:13.672
Weren't you spending
Thanksgiving down there?

04:13.674 --> 04:18.676
Well, as far as they're
concerned, I'm home on business.

04:18.678 --> 04:21.212
Yeah, well, nice to see you.

04:21.214 --> 04:25.616
Since you're here, why don't you,
uh, spend Thanksgiving here with me?

04:25.618 --> 04:27.451
Spend Thanksgiving with you here?

04:27.453 --> 04:29.586
Yeah.

04:29.588 --> 04:31.088
Sure.

04:31.090 --> 04:32.322
Great.

04:32.324 --> 04:34.057
That's a great idea.

04:34.059 --> 04:34.891
We'll be together.

04:34.893 --> 04:36.693
We'll be together on Thanksgiving.

04:36.695 --> 04:39.463
Well, look at you, you little
homunculus, uh, without any

04:39.465 --> 04:40.464
pants and no shoes.

04:40.466 --> 04:42.600
Like a man who's just
fled from a carnival.

04:42.602 --> 04:44.068
You know, you look a bit pale.

04:44.070 --> 04:45.470
Some would say pasty.

04:45.472 --> 04:47.706
I say like a freshly peeled apple.

04:47.708 --> 04:49.308
You look well, too, Rupert.

04:49.310 --> 04:52.612
Everybody calls me Ruxin... Rodney.

04:52.614 --> 04:54.013
A bet's a bet.

04:54.015 --> 04:54.714
It sucks.

04:54.716 --> 04:58.685
I feel like the only place I might
be losing weight is in the area...

04:58.687 --> 04:59.152
We got it.

04:59.154 --> 05:00.720
Nether... We got it.

05:00.722 --> 05:02.154
Don't hold back on my account.

05:02.156 --> 05:04.589
No, no, continue with this
homoerotic competition talk.

05:04.591 --> 05:05.657
It's more than delightful.

05:05.659 --> 05:06.858
Ruxin, how are you doing?

05:06.860 --> 05:10.728
I will also be paying $50
today, as I did not have a

05:10.730 --> 05:15.298
chance to run 'cause of
my father's joyous visit.

05:15.300 --> 05:16.933
But I'm glad to have him here.

05:16.935 --> 05:17.935
I'm glad to be here.

05:17.937 --> 05:21.106
I would rather pay that $50
than not have my dad here.

05:21.108 --> 05:23.542
It's so great that you
have your dad with us.

05:23.544 --> 05:24.610
It's awesome.

05:24.612 --> 05:25.678
Are you part of this group?

05:25.680 --> 05:27.546
I'm sorry, we haven't been introduced.

05:27.548 --> 05:29.115
Andre.

05:29.117 --> 05:30.183
Andre?

05:30.185 --> 05:31.685
Yeah, I was over at
your house all the time.

05:31.687 --> 05:34.154
Yeah, you used to
call him "that boy."

05:34.156 --> 05:37.157
You told me to stop wearing black
because I looked like Nosferatu.

05:37.159 --> 05:37.691
I'm so sorry.

05:37.693 --> 05:39.226
No, I don't recall that.

05:39.228 --> 05:39.993
Hey, I'm Kevin.

05:39.995 --> 05:41.061
Remember me?

05:41.063 --> 05:42.696
Look, he still talks like he's 17.

05:42.698 --> 05:44.397
Sure, I remember you.

05:44.399 --> 05:45.698
What have you done with yourself?

05:45.700 --> 05:47.033
Let me guess, let me guess.

05:47.035 --> 05:48.400
Car salesman?

05:48.402 --> 05:50.236
Or, I know, failed inventor.

05:50.238 --> 05:51.704
I'm actually a district attorney.

05:51.706 --> 05:53.973
Really?

05:53.975 --> 05:55.473
Assistant district attorney.

05:55.475 --> 05:56.975
You won.

05:56.977 --> 05:59.210
You won after all.

05:59.212 --> 06:00.211
Oh, wow.

06:00.213 --> 06:01.379
Like father like son.

06:01.381 --> 06:02.647
So good to see.

06:02.649 --> 06:03.214
Hmm.

06:03.216 --> 06:03.915
Hmm.

06:03.917 --> 06:05.249
Hmm.

06:05.251 --> 06:06.551
Hmm.

06:06.553 --> 06:09.154
Anyhow, not sure I you ever
knew this, but, um, used to

06:09.156 --> 06:12.657
steal all the liquor from your cabinets
and replace the bottles with water.

06:12.659 --> 06:13.491
I was quite aware.

06:13.493 --> 06:17.195
That's why I peed in the bottles
before you ever got there.

06:17.197 --> 06:19.364
That's why mescal
never tasted the same.

06:19.366 --> 06:22.401
As much fun as this all is,
got to go to the bathroom.

06:22.403 --> 06:23.936
Hey, another of these, please.

06:23.938 --> 06:24.871
Just get it right.

06:24.873 --> 06:25.438
Okay.

06:25.440 --> 06:26.239
Make them do it better.

06:26.241 --> 06:27.274
And in a clean glass.

06:27.276 --> 06:29.343
Okay. Thank you.

06:29.345 --> 06:32.680
Well, now you know how we feel.

06:35.044 --> 06:37.878
Let's go for a quick run.

06:43.959 --> 06:46.154
Rodney.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.142
Hey, Dad.

06:48.262 --> 06:49.208
Hey, Rodney.

06:49.328 --> 06:50.146
What are you doing here?

06:51.177 --> 06:53.581
Just watching some TV,
flipping through channels.

06:53.581 --> 06:55.074
Come and join me.

06:55.075 --> 06:56.775
Oh, boy.

06:56.777 --> 06:57.843
What are you watching?

06:57.845 --> 07:01.146
Oh, here's what I was looking
for was <i>Hoarders.</i>

07:01.148 --> 07:04.282
<i>Well, here we are,
watching the hoarders.</i>

07:05.418 --> 07:06.657
- <i>Bullshit.</i> 
<i>- Bullshit.</i>

07:06.777 --> 07:07.703
<i>This is bullshit, Dad.</i>

07:07.819 --> 07:08.584
<i>Entire bullshit.</i>

07:08.586 --> 07:10.653
<i>This was supposed to be my
house hotel this weekend.</i>

07:10.655 --> 07:11.588
<i>House hotel?</i>

07:11.590 --> 07:12.021
<i>Yeah.</i>

07:12.023 --> 07:13.089
<i>That's a great way to put it.</i>

07:13.091 --> 07:14.657
<i>That's what I was hoping for.</i>

07:14.659 --> 07:16.726
<i>That's why I... Lied to your wife.</i>

07:16.728 --> 07:17.861
<i>And you as well.</i>

07:17.863 --> 07:20.097
<i>I was hoping to make your house my, my...
Your hotel.</i>

07:20.099 --> 07:21.098
<i>My house hotel.</i>

07:21.100 --> 07:22.099
<i>I mean, full disclosure.</i>

07:22.101 --> 07:23.000
<i>Yeah.</i>

07:23.002 --> 07:23.934
<i>We're both adults.</i>

07:23.936 --> 07:25.603
<i>Yeah, you weren't here
to watch</i> <i>Hoarders.</i>

07:25.605 --> 07:27.671
<i>No, I was here to watch
the Playboy Channel.</i>

07:27.673 --> 07:28.338
<i>Bullshit.</i>

07:28.340 --> 07:29.506
<i>Bullshit.</i>

07:29.508 --> 07:30.908
<i>I was gonna watch something filthier.</i>

07:30.910 --> 07:31.441
<i>Yes.</i>

07:31.443 --> 07:32.409
<i>And not on my laptop.</i>

07:32.411 --> 07:34.645
<i>Everything is at your fingertips
at a laptop, but, no, you want</i>

07:34.647 --> 07:35.846
<i>to watch it on your... The TV.</i>

07:35.848 --> 07:36.414
<i>Yeah.</i>

07:36.416 --> 07:37.048
<i>Full volume.</i>

07:37.050 --> 07:38.016
<i>Full volume!</i>

07:38.018 --> 07:40.685
<i>Not hidden away like Anne Frank
in the attic, whispering,</i>

07:40.687 --> 07:41.686
<i>you know?</i>

07:41.688 --> 07:44.188
<i>Well, I don't think she was
doing this, but, uh, I get</i>

07:44.190 --> 07:45.556
<i>the idea.</i>

07:45.558 --> 07:49.126
<i>But if we are being honest...
I find it refreshing.</i>

07:49.128 --> 07:50.927
<i>You know the fat bet I
have going with my friends?</i>

07:50.929 --> 07:51.761
<i>Right, right, right.</i>

07:51.763 --> 07:54.697
<i>This is what I was
using the pedometer for.</i>

07:54.699 --> 07:56.298
<i>I'm not running, I'm "running."</i>

07:56.300 --> 07:59.067
<i>It's marking the... Yeah, indicates the...
I understand.</i>

07:59.069 --> 07:59.902
<i>Stop that.</i>

07:59.904 --> 08:01.837
<i>That's what you were going to
do, and that's how you were</i>

08:01.839 --> 08:03.538
<i>going to bypass athletic exertion?</i>

08:03.540 --> 08:05.707
<i>I broke a sweat.</i>

08:05.709 --> 08:07.709
<i>What a bunch of morons
you hang around with.</i>

08:07.711 --> 08:08.710
<i>I couldn't agree more, Dad.</i>

08:08.712 --> 08:10.779
<i>So, we should collaborate on that.</i>

08:10.781 --> 08:11.580
<i>Anything I can do to help that?</i>

08:11.582 --> 08:12.380
<i>Oh, no, Dad. Please!</i>

08:12.382 --> 08:13.415
<i>No, no, not that.</i>

08:13.417 --> 08:15.083
<i>Oh, for God's sake, not that.</i>

08:15.085 --> 08:17.651
<i>I'll take the thing tomorrow
morning, I'll run six miles,</i>

08:17.653 --> 08:20.954
<i>and, uh, you register it however
you want to register it.</i>

08:20.956 --> 08:22.822
<i>Now, if you'll excuse me.</i>

08:22.824 --> 08:25.391
<i>I'm gonna jerk off to interracial porn.</i>

08:25.393 --> 08:26.959
<i>Don't have to disclose everything.</i>

08:26.961 --> 08:30.095
<i>Behold, the white truffle.</i>

08:30.097 --> 08:31.463
<i>There she is.</i>

08:31.465 --> 08:34.732
<i>Wow, this is gonna make my
risotto the hit of Thanksgiving.</i>

08:34.734 --> 08:36.000
<i>Yes, it will.</i>

08:36.001 --> 08:38.770
<i>All right, let's talk business.</i>

08:38.772 --> 08:40.105
<i>All right, how much you want?</i>

08:40.107 --> 08:41.573
<i>$2,000.</i>

08:41.575 --> 08:43.909
<i>It's worth, like 800 bucks.</i>

08:43.910 --> 08:45.010
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

08:45.012 --> 08:47.980
<i>For it to be a good investment, I
have to sell it for a lot more</i>

08:47.982 --> 08:49.082
<i>than what I paid for it.</i>

08:49.084 --> 08:50.650
<i>That's not how an investment works.</i>

08:50.652 --> 08:52.119
<i>You don't understand
how business works.</i>

08:52.121 --> 08:53.788
<i>You can't just determine the price.</i>

08:53.790 --> 08:55.122
<i>I can, it's a seller's market.</i>

08:55.124 --> 08:55.923
<i>What do you mean?</i>

08:55.925 --> 08:56.524
<i>No, it's not.</i>

08:56.526 --> 08:57.458
<i>There's plenty of truffles.</i>

08:57.460 --> 08:58.259
<i>No, there aren't.</i>

08:58.261 --> 08:59.327
<i>There are none left in the city.</i>

08:59.329 --> 09:00.061
<i>You're lying to me.</i>

09:00.063 --> 09:02.129
<i>Listen, dum-dum, I don't have
time to explain to you how</i>

09:02.131 --> 09:03.497
<i>finance works, okay?</i>

09:03.499 --> 09:06.133
<i>All you need to know is that you
need to pay me a lot more money</i>

09:06.135 --> 09:07.501
<i>than what I paid for it.</i>

09:07.503 --> 09:08.636
<i>Look, just give it to me.</i>

09:08.638 --> 09:10.871
<i>I'll give you, like, 1,000 bucks, okay?</i>

09:10.873 --> 09:11.805
<i>Look, look, look.</i>

09:11.807 --> 09:13.674
<i>I was cutting you a deal because
you're a friend of a friend.</i>

09:13.676 --> 09:14.775
<i>A friend of a friend?</i>

09:14.777 --> 09:16.075
<i>Like an acquaintance.</i>

09:16.077 --> 09:17.377
<i>All right, just put it away.</i>

09:17.379 --> 09:18.077
<i>That's $3,000.</i>

09:18.079 --> 09:19.078
<i>All right, get out of here.</i>

09:19.080 --> 09:20.513
<i>$3,200.</i>

09:20.515 --> 09:21.547
<i>What if I pay you nothing?</i>

09:21.549 --> 09:23.383
<i>Hmm, that's gonna cost you.</i>

09:23.385 --> 09:24.084
<i>Ridiculous.</i>

09:24.086 --> 09:25.051
<i>What's up, shit bags?</i>

09:25.053 --> 09:25.885
<i>What's going on guys?</i>

09:25.887 --> 09:26.987
<i>Time to run.</i>

09:26.989 --> 09:28.656
<i>Ruxin is logging the miles.</i>

09:28.658 --> 09:30.958
<i>The guy's like his own
personal cross-country team.</i>

09:30.960 --> 09:33.094
<i>It's like when his dad got here,
he just went off the chain.</i>

09:33.096 --> 09:35.097
<i>Yeah, he's now running so
much, he's now walking funny.</i>

09:35.099 --> 09:37.366
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

09:37.368 --> 09:38.100
<i>What is this?</i>

09:38.102 --> 09:39.068
<i>Heather. Look at this.</i>

09:39.070 --> 09:40.103
<i>Heather.</i>

09:40.105 --> 09:42.672
<i>You guys remember Heather, right?</i>

09:42.674 --> 09:43.372
<i>Hi!</i>

09:43.374 --> 09:44.106
<i>Oh, my.</i>

09:44.108 --> 09:45.041
<i>Doesn't she look great?</i>

09:45.043 --> 09:45.741
<i>Heather!</i>

09:45.743 --> 09:46.509
<i>Good to see you.</i>

09:46.511 --> 09:47.410
<i>Where's the rest of you?</i>

09:47.412 --> 09:47.977
<i>What happened?</i>

09:47.979 --> 09:49.112
<i>I got the lap band surgery.</i>

09:49.114 --> 09:50.080
<i>Doesn't she look great?</i>

09:50.082 --> 09:51.915
<i>Did Andre do your lap band surgery?</i>

09:51.917 --> 09:53.718
<i>No, I had like a real doctor do it.</i>

09:53.720 --> 09:54.552
<i>I'm a real doctor.</i>

09:54.554 --> 09:55.119
<i>Smart, smart.</i>

09:55.121 --> 09:56.988
<i>Oh, my God, look at you.</i>

09:56.990 --> 09:59.757
<i>I have not seen you with hair
growing out of your face.</i>

09:59.759 --> 10:01.359
<i>I have a penis beard now, too.</i>

10:01.361 --> 10:02.126
<i>Do you go like this with it?</i>

10:02.128 --> 10:03.394
<i>It's too short.</i>

10:03.396 --> 10:05.097
<i>Okay, what the hell
are you talking about?</i>

10:05.099 --> 10:07.131
<i>This is not an appropriate
conversation here, all right?</i>

10:07.133 --> 10:07.932
<i>This is my sister.</i>

10:07.934 --> 10:10.402
<i>You know I was their
sexual mentor, Andre.</i>

10:10.404 --> 10:11.937
<i>She taught us everything we know.</i>

10:11.939 --> 10:14.505
<i>Taco didn't know what a vagina
was until I got my hands</i>

10:14.507 --> 10:15.139
<i>on him.</i>

10:15.141 --> 10:16.074
<i>He was 11.</i>

10:16.076 --> 10:16.774
<i>That was wrong.</i>

10:17.503 --> 10:19.403
<i>He was a clueless 11.</i>

10:19.405 --> 10:20.871
<i>A very learned 12.</i>

10:20.873 --> 10:22.873
<i>She taught me no hole left behind.</i>

10:22.875 --> 10:24.308
<i>Pete, are you still a generous lover?</i>

10:24.310 --> 10:26.410
<i>You know, I got to say,
I've become very selfish.</i>

10:26.412 --> 10:28.679
<i>You know, I find it feels the
same for me either way, so I'm</i>

10:28.681 --> 10:29.513
<i>going with it.</i>

10:29.515 --> 10:30.881
<i>That's a shame but I respect it.</i>

10:30.883 --> 10:31.749
<i>Yeah.</i>

10:31.751 --> 10:32.616
<i>You remember your moves?</i>

10:32.618 --> 10:34.151
<i>You know, there's so much information.</i>

10:34.153 --> 10:36.186
<i>I do the best I can, but
this really helped out.</i>

10:36.188 --> 10:36.754
<i>The church?</i>

10:36.756 --> 10:37.287
<i>Yeah.</i>

10:37.289 --> 10:37.888
<i>Yeah.</i>

10:37.890 --> 10:38.755
<i>Here's the church.</i>

10:38.757 --> 10:40.123
<i>Here's the steeple.</i>

10:40.125 --> 10:42.125
<i>Open the doors, just
eat all the people.</i>

10:42.127 --> 10:44.661
<i>Nose, nose, nose, nose...
What the hell is this?</i>

10:44.663 --> 10:46.363
<i>You got a good...
What were you running like a</i>

10:46.365 --> 10:48.164
<i>sex clinic out of the house?</i>

10:48.284 --> 10:50.285
<i>What did you think we were
doing in there when we told you</i>

10:50.287 --> 10:51.085
<i>we were playing video games?</i>

10:51.087 --> 10:53.087
<i>I don't know, playing video games?</i>

10:53.089 --> 10:54.689
<i>Yeah, we were playing
"Sister Invader."</i>

10:54.691 --> 10:55.666
<i>Yeah, "Seven minutes in Heather."</i>

10:55.786 --> 10:57.225
<i>Look, I'm your sister.</i>

10:57.227 --> 10:58.459
<i>I'm a sexual being.</i>

10:58.461 --> 11:00.694
<i>Okay, I'm your brother
and I'm not, so...</i>

11:00.696 --> 11:02.696
<i>I mean, I am, but I'm
not interested in...</i>

11:02.698 --> 11:04.431
<i>Don't be so ungrateful.</i>

11:04.433 --> 11:06.967
<i>Remember that night where I
taught you all those sex tips?</i>

11:06.969 --> 11:08.435
<i>No, I don't.</i>

11:08.437 --> 11:11.304
<i>All those tips actually
came from your sister.</i>

11:11.306 --> 11:12.238
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

11:12.240 --> 11:12.839
<i>Wow.</i>

11:12.841 --> 11:15.074
<i>So, by proxy, then, you
learned everything you know</i>

11:15.076 --> 11:16.408
<i>about sex from your sister Heather.</i>

11:16.410 --> 11:17.643
<i>Okay... All right.</i>

11:17.645 --> 11:18.644
<i>Interesting.</i>

11:18.646 --> 11:19.645
<i>No, no, no.</i>

11:19.647 --> 11:21.124
<i>Why don't we leave these two alone...
She's not teaching me</i>

11:21.244 --> 11:22.213
<i>anything about sex.</i>

11:22.333 --> 11:23.292
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>You guys have fun.</i>

11:23.412 --> 11:24.147
<i>Thank you so much, good
to see you again.</i>

11:24.288 --> 11:26.179
<i>No. All right, I'll meet up with you guys.</i>
<i>So good to see you again.</i>

11:26.924 --> 11:27.856
<i>That's gross.</i>

11:27.858 --> 11:28.523
<i>What do you know?</i>

11:28.525 --> 11:29.958
<i>What do you mean, what do I know?</i>

11:29.960 --> 11:30.926
<i>I can help you so much.</i>

11:30.928 --> 11:31.927
<i>I don't want your help.</i>

11:31.929 --> 11:34.463
<i>I know you think you're a sex
expert, but most women, they</i>

11:34.465 --> 11:35.798
<i>can't have orgasms.</i>

11:35.800 --> 11:36.765
<i>Trust me.</i>

11:36.767 --> 11:39.268
<i>I've dated a ton of girls, and
they've all told me they've</i>

11:39.270 --> 11:40.136
<i>never had one.</i>

11:40.138 --> 11:42.939
<i>Oh, my God, you're so
adorable and heartbreaking.</i>

11:42.941 --> 11:44.474
<i>Do you have any moves?</i>

11:44.476 --> 11:46.376
<i>'Cause I can help you with this.</i>

11:46.378 --> 11:48.192
<i>That-that's my move.</i>

11:48.312 --> 11:50.222
<i>Ah! That's our move.</i>

11:50.342 --> 11:50.940
<i>Oh, no, no.</i>

11:50.942 --> 11:52.843
<i>It's our move.</i>

11:52.963 --> 11:54.041
<i>Let's call Mom and Dad.</i>

11:57.536 --> 11:58.002
Heather!

11:58.004 --> 11:58.836
Hi!

11:58.838 --> 12:00.271
So good to see you,
thank you for coming.

12:00.273 --> 12:01.139
Happy Thanksgiving.

12:01.141 --> 12:02.407
Happy Thanksgiving.

12:02.409 --> 12:03.774
Hello, hey.

12:03.776 --> 12:04.575
Get in here, buddy.

12:04.577 --> 12:05.576
Oh, what are you doing?

12:05.578 --> 12:06.844
We don't... Give me a hug.

12:06.846 --> 12:07.311
Give me a hug.

12:07.313 --> 12:07.845
No.

12:07.847 --> 12:08.445
Can I give you a hug?

12:08.447 --> 12:09.146
No, gross.

12:09.148 --> 12:09.780
Can we pound it out?

12:09.782 --> 12:10.481
No.

12:10.483 --> 12:11.281
Thank you.

12:11.283 --> 12:12.449
Thank you, Heather, thank you.

12:12.451 --> 12:13.116
Jenny's in the kitchen.

12:13.118 --> 12:13.850
She wanted to say hello to you.

12:13.852 --> 12:14.584
Oh, yes.

12:14.586 --> 12:15.252
Here, I'll take this.

12:15.254 --> 12:16.353
Andre, is that your risotto?

12:16.355 --> 12:17.187
It is, indeed.

12:17.189 --> 12:18.489
You know what's missing?

12:18.491 --> 12:20.124
I got a nice truffle
sitting right here.

12:20.126 --> 12:22.827
Yeah, I'm not gonna pay
$2,000 for your white truffle.

12:22.829 --> 12:25.965
That's right, you're gonna pay
$2,200 for it because of the market.

12:25.967 --> 12:26.832
What market?

12:26.834 --> 12:30.069
For it to be a good investment, I need
you to give me as much or more than

12:30.071 --> 12:30.803
what I'm asking.

12:30.805 --> 12:32.538
Taco, I'm never buying that truffle.

12:32.540 --> 12:34.207
Fine, then he's gonna steal
it right from under you.

12:34.209 --> 12:35.041
I will never.

12:35.043 --> 12:37.344
See, now we got a good old-
fashioned bidding war going on.

12:37.346 --> 12:38.011
We don't.

12:38.013 --> 12:38.945
No, the opposite of that.

12:38.947 --> 12:39.446
Oh!

12:39.448 --> 12:40.547
It's good to see you.

12:40.549 --> 12:41.615
Thank you.

12:41.617 --> 12:43.216
It's great to see you.

12:43.218 --> 12:44.385
I'm so glad you're here.

12:44.387 --> 12:47.521
Kevin was like a little boy
when he heard you were coming.

12:47.523 --> 12:49.623
He was just...
I'm so happy to see him.

12:49.625 --> 12:50.624
Ah.

12:50.626 --> 12:51.559
You make him so happy.

12:51.561 --> 12:52.560
Oh, thank you.

12:52.562 --> 12:54.328
And I know he's making you happy.

12:54.330 --> 12:54.895
Yeah.

12:54.897 --> 12:55.496
I'm good.

12:55.498 --> 12:57.131
Especially orally.

12:57.133 --> 12:58.065
I'm sorry?

12:58.067 --> 13:00.201
He was taught by the best.

13:00.203 --> 13:01.236
This guy.

13:01.238 --> 13:02.571
Wow.

13:02.573 --> 13:04.573
Come on, I bet he's great down there.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.141
Eh.

13:06.143 --> 13:07.576
I'm having a heart attack right now.

13:07.578 --> 13:08.811
Is he doing the church?

13:08.813 --> 13:09.979
Is he going to church?

13:09.981 --> 13:11.881
No, we don't go to church.

13:11.883 --> 13:14.651
Is he doing the thing where
he pulls back the labia majora

13:14.653 --> 13:17.587
and he kind of goes
into the labia minora?

13:17.589 --> 13:22.591
Oh, I'm not really sure about the whole...
majora, minora.

13:22.593 --> 13:24.426
I would love to reteach him.

13:24.428 --> 13:27.596
Yeah, see, I think that's
just a little... strange.

13:27.598 --> 13:28.597
It would be my joy.

13:28.599 --> 13:33.668
Thank you, but where he's married
to me, I think it just is a little...

13:33.670 --> 13:34.602
Oh!

13:34.604 --> 13:36.037
Yes, that's strange.

13:36.039 --> 13:38.173
That is not what I meant at all.

13:38.175 --> 13:39.174
No.

13:39.176 --> 13:40.275
He would do it to you.

13:40.277 --> 13:41.176
I would just be there.

13:41.178 --> 13:43.111
I'd be, like, right there, you know?

13:43.113 --> 13:45.013
Wow, no, yeah.

13:45.015 --> 13:47.082
That-that's a little weird, too.

13:47.084 --> 13:49.018
Would you rather I
did it directly to you?

13:49.020 --> 13:52.288
And then he would just watch and
take notes and kind of... No.

13:52.290 --> 13:53.256
I think we're good.

13:53.258 --> 13:55.025
You don't want me to reteach him?

13:55.027 --> 13:55.559
No.

13:55.561 --> 13:56.560
Not a refresher course?

13:56.562 --> 13:57.427
No.

13:57.429 --> 13:58.562
Are you sure?

13:58.564 --> 14:00.763
No.

14:00.765 --> 14:01.897
Oh!

14:01.899 --> 14:04.266
I just want to eat the shit
out of that right now.

14:04.268 --> 14:05.901
You should definitely have it.

14:05.903 --> 14:06.635
You know, I think I'll wait.

14:06.637 --> 14:07.669
Why don't you go ahead and have some?

14:07.671 --> 14:08.236
Oh, no.

14:08.238 --> 14:09.504
Tell you what, why don't
you eat the whole thing?

14:09.506 --> 14:10.238
I'm waiting for the weigh-in.

14:10.240 --> 14:12.040
Which, by the way, do we have
to wait for Ruxin for this?

14:12.042 --> 14:12.873
It's a good point.

14:12.875 --> 14:13.874
We do have a quorum.

14:13.876 --> 14:15.209
Never again.

14:15.211 --> 14:17.644
Andre, by the way, I couldn't
help but notice your new team

14:17.646 --> 14:22.815
name: The "Twlight-Breaking-
Dawn-dres."

14:22.817 --> 14:23.549
My God.

14:23.551 --> 14:24.550
Are you kidding me?

14:24.552 --> 14:26.585
What? It's a book for the ages.

14:26.587 --> 14:29.489
Yeah, girls ages 11 to 14.

14:29.491 --> 14:30.557
Boom.

14:30.559 --> 14:34.594
I love that you guys are still
making fun of Andre-- so defenseless.

14:34.596 --> 14:35.562
I'm not defenseless.

14:35.564 --> 14:36.296
We're shit talking.

14:36.298 --> 14:37.831
No, they're shit talking.

14:37.833 --> 14:39.166
You're shit taking.

14:39.168 --> 14:41.135
Speaking of, I think I'm gonna
drop about a half a pound

14:41.137 --> 14:42.002
before the weigh-in.

14:42.004 --> 14:42.836
Excuse me guys.

14:42.838 --> 14:43.404
Wow.

14:43.406 --> 14:44.138
That's a lot of information.

14:44.140 --> 14:44.571
Oh!

14:44.573 --> 14:45.272
All right.

14:45.274 --> 14:46.073
All right, let's do this!

14:46.075 --> 14:47.174
I like my son's chances.

14:47.176 --> 14:50.611
Yeah, I been running so much
I think I pulled something.

14:50.613 --> 14:53.947
We got 177.

14:53.949 --> 14:54.815
All right.

14:54.817 --> 14:55.849
Not bad.

14:55.851 --> 15:00.620
All right, so... If my calculations
are correct, Andre lost the most amount

15:00.622 --> 15:01.287
of weight.

15:01.289 --> 15:02.756
But isn't it half the equation?

15:02.758 --> 15:05.025
Isn't the other half the
amount of time exercised?

15:05.027 --> 15:09.028
Yes, and by a staggering
three-to-one ratio, Ruxin

15:09.030 --> 15:10.563
decimated us in that category.

15:10.565 --> 15:11.264
Boo.

15:11.266 --> 15:12.264
Sucks.

15:12.266 --> 15:15.468
Which makes Ruxin the
winner of the fat bet.

15:15.470 --> 15:16.302
Oh!

15:16.304 --> 15:17.270
And the Bears tickets, too.

15:17.272 --> 15:20.974
I might take a complete
stranger, or just throw them away.

15:20.976 --> 15:24.344
You literally have lost
no weight here at all.

15:24.346 --> 15:25.579
Bro, it's all muscle.

15:25.581 --> 15:27.348
But this guy-- look
at him over here.

15:27.350 --> 15:30.818
He worked hard, he dieted, he took care of...
What was that?

15:30.820 --> 15:31.886
W-What?

15:31.888 --> 15:33.821
What are you doing?

15:33.823 --> 15:34.889
It's a slimming belt.

15:34.891 --> 15:35.590
Oh, dear God.

15:35.592 --> 15:36.491
Oh!

15:36.493 --> 15:37.592
It's not cheating,
it's a slimming belt.

15:37.594 --> 15:38.492
Those are Spanx.

15:38.494 --> 15:39.460
No, they're not.

15:39.462 --> 15:41.028
It's like a weight belt
that you wear all day.

15:41.030 --> 15:42.062
That's a corset, Andre.

15:42.064 --> 15:43.830
No, it's called the Belly Bandit.

15:43.832 --> 15:44.865
That's for pregnant women.

15:44.867 --> 15:47.233
It's a postpartum girdle.

15:50.638 --> 15:51.904
Oh, my God, Pete.

15:51.906 --> 15:53.239
It's so boring out there.

15:53.241 --> 15:54.874
I have a great idea.

15:54.876 --> 15:56.376
Let's play video games.

15:56.378 --> 15:57.344
Okay, all right.

15:57.346 --> 15:58.911
This is what Thanksgiving's all about.

15:58.913 --> 15:59.545
What-what? Okay.

15:59.547 --> 16:00.880
You got to... Whoa, hey.

16:00.882 --> 16:01.314
Sorry, buddy.

16:01.316 --> 16:02.849
First of all, it's very
important to remember.

16:02.851 --> 16:03.483
Okay, yes.

16:03.485 --> 16:06.386
During Thanksgiving, the
Indians taught the cowboys to

16:06.388 --> 16:08.556
eat maize and be generous lovers.

16:08.558 --> 16:09.257
Okay.

16:09.259 --> 16:10.191
And it was very important.

16:10.193 --> 16:11.259
You have to celebrate that.

16:11.261 --> 16:12.527
Heather, I'm loving this.

16:12.529 --> 16:14.562
The boobs, the butt, the
whole thing's great.

16:14.564 --> 16:17.832
I'm just so hungry, I literally can't
think of anything else right now.

16:17.834 --> 16:19.533
You'd rather eat than have sex?

16:19.535 --> 16:21.168
Yeah, when you say it like
that, it sounds really bad.

16:21.170 --> 16:22.570
Okay, I understand completely.

16:22.572 --> 16:23.938
Go tide yourself over.

16:23.940 --> 16:25.105
I'll meet you in eight minutes.

16:25.107 --> 16:27.574
We'll go to the bathroom, but
really, you'll lick my vagina.

16:27.576 --> 16:28.575
It'll be perfect.

16:28.577 --> 16:29.176
All right.

16:29.178 --> 16:32.178
I'm gonna eat, and then we'll do the
V and the A, and it'll be great.

16:32.180 --> 16:33.179
That's the holiday spirit.

16:33.181 --> 16:34.180
Happy Thanksgiving.

16:34.182 --> 16:34.780
It'll be great.

16:34.782 --> 16:36.916
Game plan. Mm.

16:36.918 --> 16:39.285
What a doll.

16:42.045 --> 16:44.287
You've never taken me to
church, is all I'm saying.

16:44.407 --> 16:45.939
Honey, the woman is a lunatic, okay?

16:45.941 --> 16:47.908
And I want to take you to
church, I just get confused.

16:47.910 --> 16:49.943
Sometimes I pull up, and I'm
sweaty already, and I'm not

16:49.945 --> 16:52.011
exactly sure which door
to go into, all right?

16:52.013 --> 16:55.962
So, let's just feed the beast and...
Did you let him out?

16:56.082 --> 16:56.781
No, I did not let him out.

16:56.783 --> 16:57.382
Did you?

16:57.384 --> 16:59.384
No.

16:59.386 --> 17:00.118
Shakespeare?

17:00.120 --> 17:00.718
Put your finger in.

17:00.720 --> 17:01.386
See if it's in there.

17:01.388 --> 17:01.986
No.

17:01.988 --> 17:02.787
Shakespeare.

17:02.789 --> 17:03.822
This is not good.

17:03.824 --> 17:05.257
Shakespeare.

17:05.259 --> 17:06.258
Shakespeare?

17:06.260 --> 17:07.224
Oh, you got to be kidding me!

17:07.227 --> 17:07.759
Oh, shit!

17:07.761 --> 17:08.393
What?

17:08.395 --> 17:09.828
Taco's truffle!

17:09.829 --> 17:11.396
That's a $1,000 truffle.

17:11.397 --> 17:12.897
He ate the whole truffle!

17:12.900 --> 17:15.233
How does...
Look, there's truffle shavings!

17:15.236 --> 17:17.804
He dragged it out like a
lion ripping out a gazelle.

17:17.806 --> 17:19.806
If we were a restaurant,
they would shut us down.

17:19.808 --> 17:20.907
They would give us a "D."

17:20.910 --> 17:21.842
We have to figure something out.

17:21.844 --> 17:22.675
What are we gonna do?

17:22.678 --> 17:25.413
We got to tell people that there's a beast...
Nothing.

17:25.415 --> 17:27.648
We're not going to do anything.

17:27.651 --> 17:29.650
I am hosting Thanksgiving dinner.

17:29.652 --> 17:31.686
We're not saying one
thing about Shakespeare.

17:31.688 --> 17:33.654
We're not saying one thing
about that truffle.

17:33.656 --> 17:37.424
We are just going to host
confidently and silently.

17:37.426 --> 17:38.292
Like Helen Keller.

17:38.294 --> 17:40.694
No.

17:42.000 --> 17:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

17:52.440 --> 17:53.373
All right, guys.

17:53.375 --> 17:55.375
Heather is officially
in the giving mood.

17:55.377 --> 17:57.377
She tried to violate me
in Ellie's playroom.

17:57.379 --> 17:58.044
Oh!

17:58.046 --> 18:00.114
That's why I had sex
with her yesterday.

18:00.116 --> 18:00.681
What?

18:00.683 --> 18:01.382
Why?

18:01.384 --> 18:04.385
Get the sex out of the way early,
that way, there's no sexual tension.

18:04.387 --> 18:06.020
I hate sexual tension.

18:06.022 --> 18:07.222
God, Kevin!

18:07.224 --> 18:10.625
You put it back in the
oven after you baste it.

18:10.627 --> 18:12.961
Yummy.

18:15.464 --> 18:17.031
I love truffles.

18:17.033 --> 18:19.934
So, why don't you and I go
to my house and we'll make

18:19.936 --> 18:22.069
papardelle together
with the the truffle.

18:22.071 --> 18:22.703
Do you like that?

18:22.705 --> 18:23.637
I would love that.

18:23.639 --> 18:24.671
Taco?

18:24.673 --> 18:25.405
I want to buy that truffle.

18:25.407 --> 18:26.339
No can do.

18:26.341 --> 18:27.207
Just sold it to Rupert.

18:27.209 --> 18:27.874
Forget about him.

18:27.876 --> 18:29.175
Come on, give it to your old pal.

18:29.177 --> 18:30.076
No, no, no, no.

18:30.078 --> 18:31.010
You snooze, you don't win.

18:31.012 --> 18:32.979
I'm about to get it
in Ellie's playroom.

18:32.981 --> 18:34.881
All right, I will pay you anything.

18:34.883 --> 18:35.348
Double.

18:35.350 --> 18:36.015
No, no, no.

18:36.017 --> 18:36.750
I'll take the truffle.

18:36.752 --> 18:37.417
I want the truffle.

18:37.419 --> 18:38.719
All right, bidding war.

18:38.721 --> 18:39.453
Okay, I'll give you 300 cash.

18:39.455 --> 18:39.887
400.

18:39.889 --> 18:40.421
3,000.

18:40.423 --> 18:41.155
500 cash.

18:41.157 --> 18:42.090
600.

18:42.092 --> 18:42.890
6,000.

18:42.892 --> 18:45.027
I'll give you 600 cash right now.

18:45.029 --> 18:45.828
Sold!

18:45.830 --> 18:46.863
Yes!

18:46.865 --> 18:50.167
And that's how you make an investment.

18:50.169 --> 18:55.205
And a little lemon sorbet as a
palate cleanser between courses.

18:55.207 --> 18:56.373
Awesome.

18:56.375 --> 18:57.173
Yeah.

18:57.175 --> 18:58.174
I love ice cream.

18:58.176 --> 19:00.343
It's not ice cream, it's sorbet.

19:00.345 --> 19:04.380
You just gently take a little
lick to cleanse your palate.

19:04.382 --> 19:07.083
Just gently.

19:07.085 --> 19:09.185
No, you're using your teeth.

19:09.187 --> 19:11.220
Biting is not good for the sorbet.

19:11.222 --> 19:12.388
Who cares about the sorbet?

19:12.390 --> 19:13.923
I care about the sorbet.

19:13.925 --> 19:18.227
Kevin, just let the sorbet know you're
there with the heat of your breath.

19:18.229 --> 19:21.931
Awaken it just ever so
slightly before you touch it.

19:21.933 --> 19:23.400
By accident, almost.

19:23.402 --> 19:24.401
By accident with your lips.

19:24.403 --> 19:28.104
Don't be shy to get a
little finger in there, too.

19:28.106 --> 19:32.641
Oh, so eating sorbet
is like going to church.

19:32.643 --> 19:33.876
That would be amazing.

19:33.878 --> 19:37.112
I don't really like sorbet, but
I love watching women eat it.

19:37.114 --> 19:38.980
Ah, oh.

19:38.982 --> 19:40.414
I got a seed.

19:40.416 --> 19:41.616
That happens.

19:41.618 --> 19:45.419
You know, it's like your tongue
is dead weight, it fell asleep.

19:45.421 --> 19:49.256
And you have to drag it with
the motion of your head.

19:49.258 --> 19:53.227
I love the way Heather eats that
sorbet. I myself enjoy the sorbet, but I

19:53.229 --> 19:57.332
like what you're saying about
letting your tongue do that.

19:57.334 --> 20:01.503
You're doing something with the
movement of your head, but I

20:01.505 --> 20:05.441
find that you can eat the sorbet
while keeping an active tongue.

20:05.443 --> 20:06.943
Like this.

20:06.945 --> 20:07.910
Yeah, get active.

20:07.912 --> 20:11.362
Doesn't have to be completely dead. But
it really is whatever you feel like.

20:11.482 --> 20:14.725
Ah, I like what you're doing there.

20:14.960 --> 20:17.186
You do as you feel... Dip it in.

20:18.071 --> 20:21.593
And... deep, and you can make it deep.

20:21.713 --> 20:23.380
I'm never gonna be able to
eat sorbet like that.

20:23.500 --> 20:24.866
Sticky.

20:26.332 --> 20:28.054
I feel like I'm watching my own birth.

20:28.174 --> 20:32.786
Ooh, yeah. You show me
how you like me to eat sorbet.

20:32.906 --> 20:35.083
Can we get a palate cleanser
for our palate cleanser?

20:35.330 --> 20:37.053
♪ Da, da, da...! ♪

20:38.031 --> 20:39.956
The turkey's here!
Hey!

20:40.076 --> 20:40.753
That smells good.

20:40.871 --> 20:43.175
Okay, let's get it going,
pass the plates down.

20:43.177 --> 20:46.218
I'm actually gonna excuse
myself for a second, and take

20:46.220 --> 20:49.052
myself out of the
situation, lap band wise.

20:49.054 --> 20:49.885
Totally understand.

20:49.887 --> 20:50.719
Okay, all right.

20:50.721 --> 20:51.485
Thank you so much.

20:51.487 --> 20:52.819
All right, let's eat!

20:52.821 --> 20:54.719
As hard as it it to admit,
this turkey's delicious.

20:54.721 --> 20:57.286
It's got, like, a really
rich, earthy quality to it.

20:57.288 --> 20:58.588
Oh, thanks.

20:58.590 --> 21:00.025
Almost tastes like truffles.

21:00.027 --> 21:01.295
There are truffles in this?

21:01.297 --> 21:02.228
Kevin did you use the truffle?

21:02.230 --> 21:03.729
No, I didn't touch the truffle.

21:03.731 --> 21:05.166
Andre, you snake!

21:05.168 --> 21:05.999
You took the truffle.

21:06.001 --> 21:06.999
I didn't eat your truffle.

21:07.001 --> 21:08.934
I told you, I...Oh, dear God.

21:08.936 --> 21:11.301
No.

21:12.969 --> 21:14.304
Shakespeare?

21:14.306 --> 21:16.507
Oh...Ugh!

21:16.509 --> 21:20.312
You fed us goddamn guinea pig like
some Peruvian street urchin?!

21:20.314 --> 21:21.313
It's a tur-guinea!

21:21.315 --> 21:22.013
Yeah.

21:22.015 --> 21:24.383
Thank you to Kevin and Jenny,
for letting me taste what a dead

21:24.385 --> 21:26.685
pet guinea pig tastes like.

21:26.687 --> 21:27.853
You ate Shakespeare?

21:27.855 --> 21:28.321
No!

21:28.323 --> 21:29.256
You ate Shakespeare?

21:29.258 --> 21:29.923
No, no, no!

21:29.925 --> 21:30.758
No, honey.

21:30.760 --> 21:32.859
Ellie, Ellie!

21:36.395 --> 21:37.329
Oh, my God, Dad!

21:37.331 --> 21:38.331
Oh, Heather.

21:38.333 --> 21:39.931
Hey, guys!

21:39.933 --> 21:42.200
I just saw your dad's vinegar strokes.

21:42.202 --> 21:44.094
I saw into his soul.

21:44.214 --> 21:45.602
Not good.
