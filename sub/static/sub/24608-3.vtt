WEBVTT

00:00.021 --> 00:02.201
Previously on Genius...

00:02.202 --> 00:04.399
Picaso and I, we are the future.

00:04.400 --> 00:06.001
I wish I had a place like this.

00:06.002 --> 00:07.536
But you can work here if you want.

00:07.537 --> 00:10.538
I could give you 150
francs every month.

00:10.706 --> 00:13.275
In return, I own
everything you produce.

00:13.276 --> 00:14.509
To Picasso.

00:14.510 --> 00:16.311
To Picasso!

00:16.312 --> 00:18.079
I am in love with Germaine.

00:18.080 --> 00:19.481
I'm not in love with you.

00:19.482 --> 00:20.649
Why, why not?

00:20.650 --> 00:22.918
Because you cannot satisfy me!

00:22.919 --> 00:24.319
Carles, wait!

00:24.320 --> 00:25.587
You cannot go back to Paris.

00:25.588 --> 00:27.656
No, I'm going back to Barcelona.

00:27.657 --> 00:29.057
Carles, no, no...

00:30.526 --> 00:33.229
It's my fault. I should
never have believed him.

00:33.230 --> 00:34.497
She's his mistress?

00:34.498 --> 00:35.961
How many does he have?

00:35.962 --> 00:37.396
How many women has he painted?

00:37.397 --> 00:38.931
So you're finished with Dora?

00:38.932 --> 00:42.268
Of course not. She's brilliant.

00:42.269 --> 00:45.938
I can't remember the last time she
made me want to pick up a brush.

00:46.439 --> 00:48.574
I need something new.

00:48.608 --> 00:50.738
I want to be a painter.

00:50.739 --> 00:52.273
You will become a lawyer.

00:52.274 --> 00:54.342
Matisse is the
greatest painter in the world.

00:54.343 --> 00:56.110
But Picasso is much better-looking.

00:56.111 --> 00:58.179
We're having a
joint exhibition at a very

00:58.180 --> 00:59.914
well-respected gallery.

00:59.915 --> 01:02.669
You must come and visit me
sometime. To see some of my work.

01:02.670 --> 01:06.160
You are going to
paint her, aren't you?

01:43.387 --> 01:45.988
You are my wife, you
will do what I tell you to...

01:45.989 --> 01:48.357
Get away from me!

01:54.231 --> 01:55.831
No...

02:08.463 --> 02:10.396
That's all I have.

02:12.967 --> 02:14.968
Is it enough to get me to Paris?

02:23.511 --> 02:25.045
Bastards.

02:25.046 --> 02:26.680
Yes, charming, aren't they?

02:26.681 --> 02:29.249
Well, no one can charm you, Francoise.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.952
Except perhaps a
certain Spanish painter.

02:32.487 --> 02:34.821
He probably won't even remember us.

02:34.822 --> 02:39.250
Maybe not me, but he
certainly hasn't forgotten you.

02:44.248 --> 02:45.315
Good afternoon.

02:45.316 --> 02:48.018
We've come to see Monsieur Picasso.

02:48.019 --> 02:50.286
Of course you have.

03:01.802 --> 03:06.605
Oh. What a surprise.

03:06.606 --> 03:09.359
We thought you would be expecting us.

03:09.360 --> 03:11.541
Yes. Days ago.

03:13.899 --> 03:16.846
We've been busy with
our show. You should come.

03:19.717 --> 03:24.049
You mentioned you
might show us some of your art.

03:24.856 --> 03:28.713
It would be a thrill for us.

03:28.714 --> 03:30.348
Uh, no.

03:30.349 --> 03:33.019
I, if you want to see
art, you go to a gallery,

03:33.378 --> 03:35.186
an exhibition, a museum.

03:35.187 --> 03:38.980
Mm, you go to the Louvre.

03:38.981 --> 03:40.826
Well, it seems
we've disturbed you after all.

03:40.827 --> 03:42.043
Ah.

03:42.044 --> 03:43.436
Thank you for the invitation.

03:43.437 --> 03:46.081
You're welcome to return, of course.

03:46.082 --> 03:51.243
But if you do, don't come like
the worshipers to the Holy Land.

03:51.652 --> 03:54.457
Come because you want to see me.

04:09.646 --> 04:13.369
Apparently they are
having some kind of a show.

04:13.370 --> 04:16.180
Find out where it is.

04:16.712 --> 04:19.740
The artist's name is Francoise Gilot.

04:19.741 --> 04:22.584
She's a most intriguing
young discovery.

04:23.256 --> 04:26.761
Don't you agree, Monsieur Picasso?

04:30.634 --> 04:33.104
Thank you for
allowing me to work here.

04:33.105 --> 04:35.715
No money for models?

04:35.716 --> 04:40.718
No, but the real world is a
better subject for art, anyway.

04:41.286 --> 04:45.313
Christ is the
only real subject for art.

04:45.393 --> 04:49.594
What you do they sell
in alleys to perverts.

04:50.648 --> 04:54.128
But it is not my business.

04:54.129 --> 04:56.181
I must warn you.

04:56.182 --> 04:58.201
The whores wearing the bonnets...

04:58.202 --> 05:00.672
Have syphilis. I know.

05:00.673 --> 05:02.656
Yes, well.

05:02.657 --> 05:05.640
Best to keep your distance.

05:10.035 --> 05:13.167
Will you paint me without the bonnet?

05:13.168 --> 05:16.395
I don't want anyone
seeing me like this.

05:19.573 --> 05:23.147
What if I paint you
in a beautiful white veil?

05:29.632 --> 05:32.241
No one wants to buy
pictures of dying whores!

05:32.242 --> 05:34.051
I make the art, you sell it.

05:34.052 --> 05:35.722
If you can't, that's your problem.

05:35.723 --> 05:37.497
I thought you
were headed for greatness.

05:37.498 --> 05:39.237
Why else would I dole out
money to you every month?

05:39.238 --> 05:40.804
I'm painting, aren't I?

05:40.805 --> 05:42.335
Blue hags and corpses!

05:42.336 --> 05:43.971
Van Gogh and Lautrec...

05:43.972 --> 05:45.711
Paint flowers, show girls,

05:45.712 --> 05:48.496
anything people can eat dinner under
without losing their appetite.

05:48.497 --> 05:51.036
I can only paint what I feel.

05:51.037 --> 05:53.429
No one else wants to feel like that.

05:54.867 --> 05:57.641
You look like you're the one
who died, for Christ's sake.

06:00.227 --> 06:03.628
My closest friend
put a bullet in his brain.

06:05.622 --> 06:08.675
Yes. It's terrible.

06:10.356 --> 06:12.547
But you must learn to separate
your life from your art.

06:12.548 --> 06:13.607
I can't!

06:13.608 --> 06:16.133
Then find someone else
to tell your sad stories to

06:16.134 --> 06:19.047
because I'm done with it.

06:30.752 --> 06:33.710
Germaine.

06:33.711 --> 06:36.555
Pablo.

06:41.925 --> 06:45.117
I should have tried harder.

06:45.580 --> 06:48.329
It wasn't your fault.

06:48.330 --> 06:51.217
I shouldn't have believed him.

06:51.218 --> 06:54.445
I knew he hadn't really let you go.

06:55.256 --> 06:58.205
But I never thought he'd...

06:59.816 --> 07:03.122
It was horrible.

07:03.123 --> 07:07.985
Blood all over the walls.

07:13.669 --> 07:16.313
Manuel told me that Carles...

07:16.314 --> 07:20.480
I moved just the
second before the bullet hit.

07:21.013 --> 07:25.781
Now I feel like his
ghost is following me.

07:26.547 --> 07:28.287
I know.

07:28.288 --> 07:31.001
I've tried to paint other
things, other people,

07:31.002 --> 07:34.021
but every face...

07:37.233 --> 07:40.286
Every face becomes his.

07:42.001 --> 07:45.855
You are the only one who understands.

08:13.918 --> 08:15.623
You don't have to run off.

08:15.624 --> 08:17.677
I can't go back to Manach.

08:17.678 --> 08:19.313
I need to find new lodgings.

08:19.314 --> 08:21.784
You're welcome to
stay here as long as you want.

08:21.785 --> 08:25.021
It's nice not to feel so lonely.

08:25.022 --> 08:28.710
How could we have done this?

08:28.711 --> 08:30.939
It's what we both needed.

08:30.940 --> 08:32.644
What about what Carles needed?

08:32.645 --> 08:34.174
He adored you.

08:34.176 --> 08:35.672
But it was so suffocating...

08:35.673 --> 08:37.029
Because he worshipped you!

08:37.030 --> 08:40.674
Why couldn't you just have loved him?

08:42.460 --> 08:47.576
You think I don't
ask myself that every day?

08:47.577 --> 08:50.151
Germaine I, I...

08:50.152 --> 08:53.319
You've said enough.

08:53.320 --> 08:57.556
You should go.

09:16.989 --> 09:18.902
Another coffee, Mademoiselle?

09:18.903 --> 09:21.399
No.

09:21.861 --> 09:23.914
Put it on my bill, Lucien.

09:23.915 --> 09:26.307
And bring her a bowl of soup.

09:27.605 --> 09:30.388
Thank you. I'm not hungry.

09:30.389 --> 09:32.546
Oh, well, next you're
gonna tell me you're not cold,

09:32.547 --> 09:36.583
but I've been watching
you shiver for half an hour.

09:36.584 --> 09:38.533
May I join you?

09:38.534 --> 09:40.169
My husband would not approve.

09:40.170 --> 09:41.770
Ah.

09:41.771 --> 09:45.451
Is he the one who gave you
that charming little memento?

09:51.099 --> 09:53.421
Please.

09:55.171 --> 09:57.781
I don't accept charity.

09:57.782 --> 10:00.948
Are you looking for work, then.

10:00.949 --> 10:02.654
Yes.

10:02.655 --> 10:05.682
As it happens, I could offer you work.

10:05.683 --> 10:08.213
As a model. I'm a sculptor.

10:09.999 --> 10:11.529
I don't do that sort of thing.

10:11.530 --> 10:12.956
What don't you do?

10:12.957 --> 10:16.577
Sit on a stool while
someone stares at you?

10:16.578 --> 10:19.361
You're doing it right now.

10:19.362 --> 10:20.822
Perhaps.

10:20.823 --> 10:22.772
But I have my clothes on.

10:22.773 --> 10:24.790
My name is Laurent.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.645
In case you reconsider.

10:27.646 --> 10:30.977
Paris gets, uh, horribly
cold in the winter.

10:39.933 --> 10:42.020
It is fascinating.

10:42.021 --> 10:43.690
Who is the artist?

10:43.691 --> 10:46.789
He calls himself Picasso.

10:46.790 --> 10:49.530
He had his own show
here a few months ago.

10:51.802 --> 10:54.063
Do you have more of his paintings?

10:54.064 --> 10:55.791
Unfortunately, he has not brought

10:55.792 --> 10:57.456
me anything worth showing in months.

10:57.927 --> 11:00.389
But I can offer you a
good price on this one.

11:03.253 --> 11:06.767
Well, I'm not usually inclined to, uh,

11:06.768 --> 11:11.039
begin collecting an artist until I
am more familiar with his work.

11:13.347 --> 11:15.878
Do you know where I might find him?

11:27.862 --> 11:29.218
Pardon me.

11:29.219 --> 11:32.281
I am looking for Monsieur Picasso.

11:32.282 --> 11:33.533
If I owe you money...

11:33.534 --> 11:35.135
No, no!

11:35.136 --> 11:37.606
Uh, nothing of the sort, uh,
Monsieur Vollard only had one

11:37.607 --> 11:39.311
of your paintings in his gallery,

11:39.312 --> 11:41.774
and I was hoping that you
might show me some more.

11:42.480 --> 11:44.011
I am Max Jacob.

11:44.012 --> 11:46.751
Uh, please, come in.

11:47.179 --> 11:50.197
I shipped several of my
paintings back to Barcelona

11:50.660 --> 11:53.130
but I do have many works here.

11:53.131 --> 11:57.124
Um, give me a moment, I, I
wasn't expecting a collector.

11:57.551 --> 11:59.291
Oh, no, I. No, no, no. No, no, no...

11:59.292 --> 12:00.508
I am afraid you've misunderstood.

12:00.509 --> 12:03.458
I am not a collector.

12:03.503 --> 12:04.790
What are you, then?

12:04.791 --> 12:07.645
Well, m-most days, I am a poet.

12:07.646 --> 12:10.699
A poet?

12:11.091 --> 12:12.587
Ouais.

12:12.588 --> 12:15.197
Oh, that's even
worse than being a painter.

12:20.385 --> 12:23.263
So, why are you here?

12:25.048 --> 12:27.440
To retreat from the banal.

12:32.428 --> 12:37.812
To bask in the brutal
beauty of existence...

12:41.860 --> 12:44.426
mortality.

12:45.550 --> 12:48.081
Everyone hates them.

12:51.397 --> 12:55.808
I think they are extraordinary.

13:04.067 --> 13:07.337
I may not be able to
afford a painting,

13:07.338 --> 13:11.609
but at least let me buy you a meal.

13:12.072 --> 13:14.682
What if Vollard is right?

13:14.683 --> 13:17.213
I had one chance to make
something of myself.

13:18.058 --> 13:21.321
What if it's all over?

13:22.618 --> 13:24.601
Mm, give me your hand.

13:24.602 --> 13:26.272
Why?

13:26.273 --> 13:31.589
Because I am a mystic of all trades.

13:32.783 --> 13:36.053
A poet, a critic and...

13:37.342 --> 13:40.882
A fortune teller.

13:47.853 --> 13:50.463
Oh, a glowing childhood.

13:50.464 --> 13:54.735
Oh, but life will bring sorrow.

13:55.581 --> 13:58.285
Oh, what is wrong?

13:58.469 --> 14:01.601
What if you tell me I'm about to die?

14:01.602 --> 14:05.246
Pablo, no one can escape death.

14:06.544 --> 14:10.233
But I can see in your eyes you
want to know what lies ahead

14:10.234 --> 14:15.907
even as much as you fear it.

14:15.908 --> 14:18.926
Yeah, hmm?

14:27.185 --> 14:31.734
Ah, this is promising.

14:34.877 --> 14:39.610
By the time you are 30, you
will have a very big fortune.

14:39.611 --> 14:45.910
And this line, that tells us
that love will play a great

14:45.911 --> 14:49.878
role in your art.

14:49.879 --> 14:53.906
Perhaps too great.

14:55.239 --> 14:56.943
What did he think?

14:56.944 --> 14:59.554
No one knows. Madame
Beaureande said he walked through,

14:59.555 --> 15:02.643
looked at each painting,
yours much longer then mine,

15:02.861 --> 15:04.148
then walked out.

15:04.149 --> 15:05.575
And he didn't say a word?

15:05.576 --> 15:08.595
He's interested in you.

15:08.883 --> 15:10.518
If he was interested in my work,

15:10.519 --> 15:11.945
he would have said something.

15:11.946 --> 15:14.939
Francoise, a door is opening for you.

15:14.940 --> 15:17.470
Go through it.

15:18.734 --> 15:20.951
You have a guest.

15:21.971 --> 15:25.511
Well, whoever it
is, just send them away.

15:25.556 --> 15:27.817
Very well, I shall
tell Mademoiselle Gilot that

15:27.818 --> 15:31.442
the "Great Picasso" is
too busy to see her.

15:41.079 --> 15:44.655
For you.

15:45.569 --> 15:50.223
I can't tell where the
petals end and the dress begins.

15:57.334 --> 16:00.013
Just so you know, I came to see you.

16:00.014 --> 16:03.102
Not your paintings.

16:05.931 --> 16:10.411
Then, by all means,
let's go and see my paintings.

16:13.275 --> 16:14.597
Who's she?

16:14.598 --> 16:16.232
Dora Maar.

16:16.233 --> 16:17.973
The woman you were
dining with the night we met?

16:17.974 --> 16:19.609
Mm-hmm.

16:19.610 --> 16:21.558
I wouldn't have known it was her.

16:21.559 --> 16:25.447
Though you saw
her once, across a room.

16:25.945 --> 16:29.798
An artist must always
see below the surface.

16:34.682 --> 16:36.351
This one.

16:36.352 --> 16:38.161
This one is enchanting.

16:38.162 --> 16:41.180
The, the colors, the immediacy...

16:41.364 --> 16:44.835
That's a Matisse.

16:45.924 --> 16:47.933
Forgive me.

16:51.284 --> 16:55.216
Ah, no, not many
people have the courage to

16:55.217 --> 16:57.096
tell me what they really think.

16:57.097 --> 17:00.054
Don't apologize for it.

17:00.055 --> 17:01.934
Are you going to tell me
what you thought of my paintings?

17:01.935 --> 17:07.251
Oh, there it is.
The real reason you came.

17:10.950 --> 17:14.525
- No, I... Yes.
- You want the truth?

17:19.304 --> 17:22.391
You have talent.

17:22.506 --> 17:26.011
I think you should continue to paint.

17:28.944 --> 17:30.823
You are lying to yourself.

17:30.824 --> 17:32.286
Huh.

17:32.287 --> 17:34.443
Pretending to show
interest in this girl's art

17:34.444 --> 17:36.810
because the bloom is
off one muse and you have

17:36.811 --> 17:39.238
decided to pluck another.

17:39.352 --> 17:42.301
You're just jealous.

17:42.798 --> 17:45.712
I'm also right.

17:45.756 --> 17:47.356
You want to paint something new,

17:47.357 --> 17:49.584
and you think getting
this young girl into bed

17:49.585 --> 17:51.186
will help you do that.

17:51.187 --> 17:55.675
But you really think she wants
to wake up next to an old man?

17:55.676 --> 17:58.147
Like you?

17:58.148 --> 18:01.026
But I am not too
old to make you beg for more,

18:01.697 --> 18:04.995
now am I?

18:07.928 --> 18:09.513
- Emile.
- Hmm?

18:09.514 --> 18:11.592
When are you
going to Francoise's show?

18:11.593 --> 18:13.736
Art is a pastime.

18:13.737 --> 18:16.612
One that I've allowed
Francoise to indulge in.

18:16.613 --> 18:20.492
But now that there is an end in
sight to this godforsaken war,

18:20.493 --> 18:23.303
you must resume your
studies, Francoise.

18:25.854 --> 18:28.150
If you would just
go and look at what I've done,

18:28.151 --> 18:30.308
you would see that
I'm a serious artist.

18:30.309 --> 18:33.022
Hmm. Haven't I made myself clear?

18:33.023 --> 18:36.529
You're not going to be an artist.

18:42.178 --> 18:46.250
Pablo Picasso thinks I'm one already.

18:46.251 --> 18:48.129
Oh, and how do you know that?

18:48.130 --> 18:50.495
He came to see the exhibition.

18:50.496 --> 18:53.410
And invited me to his studio.

18:53.524 --> 18:57.587
And you think it's because
he is interested in your art?

18:58.572 --> 19:00.067
Is that so hard to believe?

19:00.068 --> 19:02.713
Everyone knows the man is a lecher.

19:02.714 --> 19:04.871
If he has any interest
in you at all, Francoise,

19:04.872 --> 19:08.482
it lies between your
napkin and your chair.

19:08.840 --> 19:10.545
Emile!

19:10.546 --> 19:12.110
The Nazis are right about him.

19:12.111 --> 19:14.443
He's a degenerate.

19:14.444 --> 19:17.680
You're siding with the Nazis now?

19:17.681 --> 19:20.464
Picasso will ruin you.

19:20.465 --> 19:23.866
I forbid you to ever see him again.

19:46.468 --> 19:48.033
Good afternoon, Monsieur.

19:48.034 --> 19:50.295
A pleasure to see you again.
Mademoiselle?

19:50.296 --> 19:53.419
- Fernande.
- Oh.

19:53.568 --> 19:56.247
Are you still in need of a model?

19:56.248 --> 19:58.466
Come in.

20:05.229 --> 20:09.360
My, you can see everything.

20:11.598 --> 20:14.521
Oh, but it's quite good. Really.

20:14.522 --> 20:16.957
Unfortunately in Paris,

20:16.958 --> 20:19.915
"quite good" isn't good enough.

20:19.916 --> 20:25.268
But maybe your arrival on my
doorstep is a divine intervention.

20:26.287 --> 20:28.853
I only came here for a wage.

20:31.194 --> 20:34.221
I'm not able to pay
you at the moment, but, um,

20:34.222 --> 20:36.718
if you're in need of a bed...

20:37.773 --> 20:38.885
I'm so stupid.

20:38.886 --> 20:40.452
No, no, no, no, no.

20:40.453 --> 20:42.158
I, it's not what I meant.

20:42.159 --> 20:43.863
It would simply be
a way of paying you.

20:43.864 --> 20:46.430
I would sleep on the settee.

20:52.252 --> 20:54.479
And you have food?

20:54.480 --> 20:56.836
Bread, coffee?

20:56.916 --> 20:58.760
I live a-a meager existence,

20:58.761 --> 21:02.302
not an uncivilized one.

21:07.011 --> 21:09.611
Where would you like me?

21:11.570 --> 21:15.006
Stand over there,
and take off your clothes.

21:25.145 --> 21:27.023
You only have one bed.

21:27.024 --> 21:30.669
Well, I write all
night, sleep all day.

21:30.749 --> 21:32.932
So, we take shifts.

21:34.856 --> 21:38.604
It's, uh, primitive, but,
uh, it's warm, it's clean,

21:38.788 --> 21:40.493
and you can't afford
where you're living now.

21:40.494 --> 21:42.024
I'm not looking for charity.

21:42.025 --> 21:44.565
Uh-uh, but I told you,
you are going to be rich.

21:44.566 --> 21:47.132
So, you will pay me back.

21:49.370 --> 21:52.840
You need a new place
to paint what you want.

21:53.651 --> 21:56.251
A new life, new inspiration.

21:57.862 --> 22:00.777
So. What do you say?

22:06.007 --> 22:10.810
And when I try to shrug
away my decrepitude and, uh,

22:10.811 --> 22:14.351
populate the night with my shrill cry,

22:14.918 --> 22:18.354
I hear the death-cough of mortality,

22:18.816 --> 22:23.053
choked under corpses
in a lake of blood...

22:23.689 --> 22:28.030
My unhinging effort to die.

22:29.502 --> 22:30.893
Poe?

22:30.894 --> 22:34.504
No. Baudelaire.

22:35.872 --> 22:40.108
Aw, don't make me take
this journey alone tonight.

22:41.371 --> 22:43.667
I saw how that
journey ended for Carles.

22:43.668 --> 22:48.810
No, that was opium! Ether, is...

22:51.221 --> 22:55.849
Mmm, an entirely different magic.

22:59.436 --> 23:03.777
It is, it is like, uh...

23:05.214 --> 23:09.275
Oh, dreaming when you are awake.

23:11.200 --> 23:14.602
Such beauty.

23:14.782 --> 23:22.444
Ah, and then it is like trying
to catch a smoke in your hand.

23:29.300 --> 23:34.093
Read me another poem.

23:35.008 --> 23:40.845
If that which I love
weighs upon my wound,

23:41.656 --> 23:44.892
it pains it.

23:44.893 --> 23:50.522
If it weighs only upon summer,
it's the field that suffers.

23:51.750 --> 23:58.631
What will feed summer and my
love if not that sorrow since

23:58.885 --> 24:04.618
my love and summer can
no longer feed on joy?

24:09.188 --> 24:11.971
Baudelaire again?

24:11.972 --> 24:16.278
Mm, no, Max Jacob.

24:16.776 --> 24:18.341
You wrote that?

24:18.342 --> 24:21.860
- Yes.
- Oh, it's beautiful.

24:24.786 --> 24:26.528
Eh, you think so?

24:26.661 --> 24:31.037
Yes, sounds like
you've fallen very hard.

24:31.151 --> 24:34.657
Who is "my love?"

24:35.885 --> 24:40.678
Uh, someone I have not met yet.

24:56.142 --> 24:58.499
You're soaked.

25:06.166 --> 25:10.855
I want to show you something. Come.

25:13.650 --> 25:16.599
It's a lovely view.

25:18.035 --> 25:21.228
Yes, it is.

25:47.203 --> 25:50.849
You didn't kiss me back.

25:51.484 --> 25:55.408
But you didn't shy away either.

25:58.446 --> 26:01.673
You're a confusing young woman.

26:04.084 --> 26:07.077
I should probably go.

26:07.078 --> 26:09.166
No, no, no, no.

26:09.167 --> 26:13.681
Hey, you came to show me your art.

26:14.422 --> 26:18.032
So, show me your art.

26:27.648 --> 26:30.606
Her nose is broad like a sailor's.

26:30.607 --> 26:33.217
The colors are confusing.

26:33.218 --> 26:36.445
Fingers so tangled, all eight of them.

26:40.493 --> 26:44.137
I was hoping you would
tell me how to improve it.

26:44.355 --> 26:45.886
Just admit it.

26:45.887 --> 26:48.148
You are not here for me at all.

26:48.149 --> 26:52.595
You just want me to help you.

26:52.640 --> 26:54.239
You told me I had promise.

26:54.240 --> 26:57.582
Well, it takes more
than promise to be an artist.

26:57.583 --> 27:00.296
Because the only way
to be a true artist is to

27:00.297 --> 27:02.246
work day and night.

27:02.247 --> 27:03.637
Lose yourself in it.

27:03.638 --> 27:05.552
Completely.

27:05.553 --> 27:10.669
Do you have any idea
how lonely that is?

27:10.670 --> 27:13.558
And yet, without great solitude,

27:13.559 --> 27:15.298
no serious work is possible.

27:15.299 --> 27:17.073
I'm sorry, I didn't...

27:17.074 --> 27:19.127
You want advice?

27:19.128 --> 27:21.389
I'll give it to you.

27:21.390 --> 27:25.035
The ugly truth is this,
no one can help you.

27:27.377 --> 27:28.559
You have to do it on your own.

27:28.560 --> 27:31.300
Just as I did.

27:42.135 --> 27:43.456
Is she here?

27:43.457 --> 27:44.709
No.

27:44.710 --> 27:46.345
It's all right, Grandma.

27:46.346 --> 27:48.399
What is the meaning of this?

27:48.400 --> 27:49.792
I'm not going to law school.

27:49.793 --> 27:52.332
Oh, so you can
dedicate your life to art?

27:52.333 --> 27:53.898
And waste what I have given you?

27:53.899 --> 27:55.708
I put my thoughts on paper because

27:55.709 --> 27:57.065
I knew you wouldn't listen.

27:57.066 --> 27:58.528
This is not how I raised you.

27:58.529 --> 28:01.451
This is exactly how you raised me.

28:01.452 --> 28:03.018
To stand up for myself.

28:03.019 --> 28:05.106
I warned you to
stay away from Picasso.

28:05.107 --> 28:06.950
This is his influence.

28:06.951 --> 28:08.691
It's got nothing to do with him.

28:08.692 --> 28:10.083
It's what I want.

28:10.084 --> 28:12.450
Not while I'm supporting you.

28:12.451 --> 28:14.191
No!

28:14.192 --> 28:16.140
Oh!

28:16.141 --> 28:18.811
Emile!

28:20.283 --> 28:26.051
Emile! Stop, get out, oh...

28:29.924 --> 28:32.986
Don't expect another centime from me.

28:32.987 --> 28:35.832
You are both on your own now.

28:52.991 --> 28:56.401
I hope I haven't
made a terrible mistake.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.245
You fought for your freedom.

28:58.246 --> 29:00.647
Don't look back.

29:00.648 --> 29:04.606
But, without your father's money,

29:05.800 --> 29:09.374
I cannot offer you much more
than a shoulder to lean on.

29:09.871 --> 29:13.447
You will have to find a
way to support yourself.

29:24.700 --> 29:26.751
- Mademoiselle Gilot,
I didn't know you were

29:26.752 --> 29:29.988
coming to ride today.

29:29.989 --> 29:34.087
I, um, I haven't come to ride, I...

29:35.385 --> 29:38.229
I've come for a job.

29:48.402 --> 29:51.465
Sorry, my neck.

29:51.466 --> 29:52.752
I need a few minutes.

29:55.364 --> 29:58.077
Why put that back on?

29:58.078 --> 30:00.061
Because it's cold,
if you haven't noticed under

30:00.062 --> 30:03.673
your wool shirt.

30:04.935 --> 30:08.032
You said you wouldn't ask for that.

30:08.033 --> 30:10.365
But that was before
I've been staring at your

30:10.366 --> 30:13.697
lovely breasts for days on end.

30:13.846 --> 30:17.664
That wasn't our agreement.

30:18.127 --> 30:21.911
If you don't like it, leave.

31:12.599 --> 31:16.001
It's like he punched a
hole right through my heart.

31:16.219 --> 31:19.629
No. No, that hole already existed.

31:19.630 --> 31:22.414
Puccini just reminded
you that it was there.

31:22.415 --> 31:23.876
It's unfair.

31:23.877 --> 31:26.382
He has, he has so many
notes, voices, instruments,

31:26.383 --> 31:28.401
to make his music.

31:28.402 --> 31:31.177
All I have are canvases
and a few colors.

31:32.475 --> 31:35.458
You are every bit
the artist that he is.

31:37.034 --> 31:40.923
When I look at your
paintings, I feel such...

31:45.129 --> 31:47.252
intensity that...

31:48.763 --> 31:52.652
Uh. I, I need a release.

31:56.664 --> 31:59.126
Don't you?

32:07.803 --> 32:10.891
It will make you feel so much better.

33:02.833 --> 33:07.382
Pablo, what, what are you doing?
Get down!

33:07.531 --> 33:09.209
I know why... I know why Carles

33:09.210 --> 33:13.045
did it now. He just wanted to escape.

33:13.135 --> 33:16.849
From his broken heart,
his, his failure...

33:16.929 --> 33:18.425
That, that, that is just the,

33:18.426 --> 33:20.896
the ether whispering in
your ear, do not listen.

33:20.897 --> 33:24.750
You are on a path,
holding on to someone's hand,

33:25.038 --> 33:27.370
going someplace glorious.

33:27.371 --> 33:31.294
And then the hand just slips away.

33:31.303 --> 33:37.824
Suddenly, you're on the edge,
with no one to hold on to.

33:38.230 --> 33:40.770
I, I will, I will hold on to you.

33:40.771 --> 33:44.868
You feel yourself...

33:45.296 --> 33:46.514
Falling.

33:46.515 --> 33:49.394
If you take a step, then so will I.

33:53.093 --> 33:56.190
Why would you do that?

33:56.191 --> 33:59.705
Because I, I cannot
bear the thought of living

33:59.706 --> 34:03.595
in this world without you.

34:50.976 --> 34:52.960
Did you get lost on
your way to the Champs Elysees?

34:52.960 --> 34:55.047
Here I thought
you'd been walled up somewhere

34:55.049 --> 34:57.309
painting a masterpiece.

34:57.310 --> 34:59.920
I don't have time to paint.

34:59.921 --> 35:02.496
Wasn't that the whole
point getting away from your father?

35:02.497 --> 35:05.133
I don't have much of a choice.

35:07.231 --> 35:08.831
Picasso could help you.

35:08.832 --> 35:10.050
He's rich.

35:10.051 --> 35:12.451
He can get your work noticed.

35:12.452 --> 35:15.966
I'm not sure it's
my work he's interested in.

35:15.967 --> 35:19.099
Give him what he wants. I would.

35:21.467 --> 35:24.668
You like him, don't you?

35:24.669 --> 35:28.140
I suppose, but...

35:28.289 --> 35:29.854
But what?

35:29.855 --> 35:32.465
He may be old, but he still
has women lining up for him.

35:32.466 --> 35:35.345
He must be doing something right.

35:35.424 --> 35:39.870
Francoise, you can't
stay a virgin forever.

35:43.221 --> 35:46.692
How is your new girlfriend?

35:47.154 --> 35:49.998
As a matter of fact,
I haven't seen her in weeks.

35:50.217 --> 35:53.209
Don't tell me Pablo
Picasso has been rejected

35:53.210 --> 35:55.089
by a little girl.

35:55.090 --> 35:56.794
Hmm.

35:56.795 --> 35:59.718
Don't worry, she'll soften.

35:59.719 --> 36:02.877
They always do.

36:06.959 --> 36:12.031
In six months, you'll be
painting her like a horse, too.

36:14.025 --> 36:17.913
I'm trying to work. Huh?

36:19.768 --> 36:21.472
I got a letter from Max.

36:21.473 --> 36:23.491
How is the stubborn old dog?

36:23.492 --> 36:25.510
Refusing to leave
his little sanctuary,

36:25.511 --> 36:27.494
convinced no harm can come to him,

36:27.495 --> 36:31.314
even though they have sent the
rest of his family to the camps.

36:34.282 --> 36:36.787
Go see him, Pablo.

36:36.788 --> 36:39.049
You are the only one
who can persuade him to

36:39.050 --> 36:43.566
get out before it's too late.

36:47.335 --> 36:51.258
You've been at that for hours.

36:51.338 --> 36:53.668
Why don't you rest?

36:53.669 --> 36:56.827
It's your turn to sleep.

37:01.605 --> 37:03.623
There's plenty of room.

37:03.624 --> 37:07.895
Here, come. Lie down.

37:13.370 --> 37:16.458
Max...

37:17.790 --> 37:24.290
I love you, but not
the way you want me to.

37:27.258 --> 37:29.868
No, no, no, no, no.

37:29.869 --> 37:31.991
That is, that, that, no...

37:31.992 --> 37:33.348
I don't judge you.

37:33.349 --> 37:35.889
I just, I just don't...

37:35.890 --> 37:37.733
feel the same and I'm sorry.

37:37.734 --> 37:41.797
No, no, I, I am...

37:44.382 --> 37:46.226
I, I'm disgusting.

37:46.227 --> 37:49.185
No, Max.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

37:49.186 --> 37:53.353
Oh, tell that to
the priests and rabbis.

37:54.477 --> 37:56.877
They, they say that it's a perversion.

37:56.878 --> 38:00.349
I, I don't believe
that and neither should you.

38:00.359 --> 38:02.585
Even if I didn't, what then?

38:02.586 --> 38:05.292
Huh, what then, what?

38:05.371 --> 38:09.538
I have to, I, I have
to just hold it all in.

38:10.140 --> 38:12.366
Just, oh, my God.

38:12.367 --> 38:16.151
Just once, just once...

38:17.658 --> 38:21.929
Couldn't someone love me back?

38:22.357 --> 38:27.567
Oh Max, someone will, I promise.

38:33.808 --> 38:37.209
Oh, you're going to leave, aren't you?

38:38.959 --> 38:43.823
Um, maybe that would be...

38:45.990 --> 38:48.521
easier for you.

38:49.749 --> 38:53.046
But we'll always be friends.

39:07.396 --> 39:10.484
You say that now and...

39:10.633 --> 39:14.487
Maybe you even think that
you mean that, but...

39:15.680 --> 39:19.256
Oh, it's just never how it ends.

39:21.284 --> 39:24.451
Just go.

39:24.452 --> 39:26.887
Just.

39:26.888 --> 39:29.941
Go.

39:30.160 --> 39:34.849
Oh, oh, it is good to
see you, old friend.

39:35.555 --> 39:38.756
I am worried about you, Max.

39:38.757 --> 39:41.088
It's not safe for you.

39:41.089 --> 39:44.525
Well, I am not a Jew anymore.

39:45.823 --> 39:47.353
In case you haven't noticed,

39:47.354 --> 39:49.268
I have not been
one for decades, but...

39:49.269 --> 39:51.008
There are other reasons the Nazis

39:51.009 --> 39:53.166
could come after you.

39:53.167 --> 39:56.603
Oh, you mean
because I am a homosexual.

39:56.891 --> 40:00.467
I am not ashamed of who I am.

40:00.999 --> 40:03.225
Not anymore.

40:03.226 --> 40:07.672
I appreciate your concern,
Pablo, but I am not leaving.

40:07.716 --> 40:10.943
This is my home, here with God.

40:12.485 --> 40:14.503
I told Dora you were stubborn.

40:14.504 --> 40:17.348
Oh, how is she?

40:19.237 --> 40:21.778
Growing tired of me.

40:21.779 --> 40:23.935
Just as I am of her.

40:23.936 --> 40:26.267
How old is she?

40:26.268 --> 40:27.764
Who, Dora?

40:27.765 --> 40:31.862
No, no, the new one.

40:31.907 --> 40:33.472
21.

40:35.318 --> 40:36.848
She's a painter.

40:36.849 --> 40:38.275
Oh, is she any good?

40:38.276 --> 40:40.259
She could be.

40:40.260 --> 40:44.506
But it's the only reason she
seems to be interested in me.

40:44.507 --> 40:46.768
So I can help her with her work.

40:46.769 --> 40:50.310
Can you blame her?

40:50.355 --> 40:51.798
Well, everyone wants something from

40:51.799 --> 40:55.514
the "Great Picasso."

40:56.011 --> 41:01.327
I suppose I wish she wanted me...

41:01.580 --> 41:05.303
for me.

41:05.304 --> 41:09.158
Art. Picasso.

41:09.377 --> 41:13.204
You cannot separate the two.

41:13.205 --> 41:17.068
Offer her one sincerely,

41:17.069 --> 41:20.261
and perhaps she will want the other.

41:25.736 --> 41:28.406
Allô.

41:28.730 --> 41:33.323
Good afternoon, Mademoiselle Gilot.

41:33.324 --> 41:36.272
I, I would like for you
to come see me again.

41:39.797 --> 41:41.572
I'm not sure that would be...

41:41.573 --> 41:46.375
Not to be with me, to make art.

41:46.376 --> 41:49.194
I, I could show you how to etch.

41:49.195 --> 41:51.840
That's very kind of you,
but you don't owe me anything.

41:51.841 --> 41:58.608
But I do. An apology. I lied to you.

42:02.039 --> 42:04.649
People say I am a genius,

42:04.650 --> 42:07.433
that it all came easily to me, but...

42:07.434 --> 42:10.348
The truth is, I didn't do it alone.

42:13.943 --> 42:16.996
Many people helped me.

42:17.250 --> 42:20.660
I would like to help you.

42:20.661 --> 42:23.053
If you'll let me.

42:32.913 --> 42:37.184
She's here, again.

42:37.194 --> 42:39.629
But if you ask me,
this will not end well.

42:39.630 --> 42:43.214
Jaimé, you are
an excellent gatekeeper,

42:43.215 --> 42:45.302
but you are no clairvoyant.

42:45.303 --> 42:47.635
I don't need to know the future.

42:47.636 --> 42:50.062
I know you.

43:01.036 --> 43:03.889
Well, that's not what
you wear to an etching class.

43:03.890 --> 43:06.361
No, it isn't.

43:06.362 --> 43:10.712
But you didn't invite
me here for that.

43:10.713 --> 43:15.410
I told you,
I don't expect anything else.

43:15.411 --> 43:19.996
Well, that's
exactly why I decided to come.

44:09.640 --> 44:13.424
Are you sure you're ready?

44:13.782 --> 44:15.939
Yes.

44:15.940 --> 44:19.202
I've made up my mind.

44:37.694 --> 44:41.478
Being willing is a very
different thing than being ready.

44:44.865 --> 44:47.822
Don't you want me?

44:47.823 --> 44:54.783
Very much. But I am willing to wait.

45:16.373 --> 45:19.845
I couldn't wait to get to Paris.

45:20.654 --> 45:23.047
Back when I was your age.

45:23.231 --> 45:29.764
Here, to Monmartre where everything
important was happening.

45:39.381 --> 45:43.234
Uh, give me a moment. Would you?

45:56.645 --> 45:58.454
Hello?

45:58.455 --> 46:00.916
Who's there?

46:01.831 --> 46:04.510
It's me.

46:04.511 --> 46:07.495
Pablo?

46:11.751 --> 46:14.734
Hello, Germaine.

46:19.791 --> 46:22.922
I wasn't sure
if I would see you again.

46:22.923 --> 46:26.055
I wanted to say good-bye.

46:26.056 --> 46:29.005
I'm going back to Barcelona.

46:33.922 --> 46:36.488
Uh. I'm sure
it'll be good to be home. Hmm?

46:38.448 --> 46:41.057
I hope so.

46:41.058 --> 46:43.423
I don't blame you for leaving.

46:43.424 --> 46:47.417
I still can't sleep.

46:47.428 --> 46:51.281
I, I came to apologize
for what I said to you.

46:51.361 --> 46:53.170
It was cruel.

46:53.171 --> 46:57.721
No, you did not say
anything I didn't already feel.

46:58.079 --> 46:59.783
It was my fault.

46:59.784 --> 47:04.203
No, no, I was wrong.

47:04.204 --> 47:08.058
I didn't understand
before, but I do now.

47:09.042 --> 47:13.697
Understand what?

47:13.706 --> 47:17.709
No matter how much
you care about someone,

47:17.710 --> 47:19.692
you cannot force yourself
to love them the way

47:19.693 --> 47:23.617
they want you to.

47:25.262 --> 47:29.116
So, please, Germaine.

47:29.926 --> 47:33.919
Stop blaming yourself.

47:36.053 --> 47:40.289
Thank you, Pablo.

47:41.761 --> 47:47.598
I hope someday you
forgive yourself, too.

48:09.814 --> 48:12.981
I still think of Carles.

48:12.982 --> 48:15.687
Nearly every day.

48:17.681 --> 48:21.605
So do I.

48:22.310 --> 48:26.616
If only I could have given
him what he deserved.

48:28.610 --> 48:32.186
What he wanted.

48:32.195 --> 48:36.049
Pablo. You did.

48:39.400 --> 48:42.732
Who was that?

48:42.846 --> 48:46.570
The love of my close friend, Carles.

48:46.571 --> 48:50.807
He took his life because of her.

48:51.409 --> 48:54.845
And I almost took mine because of him.

48:58.405 --> 49:01.527
What stopped you?

49:42.192 --> 49:46.011
Well, if it isn't the
Leonardo da Vinci of the whorehouse.

49:57.715 --> 50:01.117
I am in love with Germaine.

50:08.853 --> 50:11.384
I can't paint, I can't paint.

50:11.464 --> 50:14.970
Not until I know Germaine is mine.

50:24.377 --> 50:29.066
It's not bad for a whorehouse sketch.

50:32.487 --> 50:36.001
It's time for you to pick up a brush.

50:36.002 --> 50:40.656
And for me to go.

50:45.400 --> 50:50.237
I found a way to give him in art what

50:50.238 --> 50:53.814
he couldn't have in life.

50:56.677 --> 50:59.983
I thought I would never
come back to Paris.

50:59.984 --> 51:03.281
But after I finished
that painting, I...

51:03.325 --> 51:06.423
I felt the pull to return.

51:06.424 --> 51:09.868
So, I came to this place.

51:09.869 --> 51:13.026
For a new start.

51:13.976 --> 51:18.840
And I was happy here, until I wasn't.

51:21.738 --> 51:25.044
I wanted you to see it.

51:25.045 --> 51:27.376
So you'll understand.

51:27.377 --> 51:28.838
Where you started.

51:28.839 --> 51:30.578
No, no.

51:30.579 --> 51:34.607
That it's better we don't
see each other too much.

51:37.958 --> 51:39.176
I thought...

51:39.177 --> 51:43.274
Love can be dangerous.

51:44.502 --> 51:47.251
I watched it destroy Carles.

51:47.252 --> 51:51.489
Then I learned it myself.

51:53.761 --> 51:58.971
Right here. Right here.

52:27.941 --> 52:34.927
Love can rage so strong,
that it burns itself out.

52:36.468 --> 52:38.825
Fernande!

52:42.490 --> 52:45.160
You start as lovers.

52:47.188 --> 52:50.834
But if you are not careful,

52:52.723 --> 52:57.099
you become victims
of your own passion.
