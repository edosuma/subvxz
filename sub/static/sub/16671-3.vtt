WEBVTT

00:06.760 --> 00:08.205
Ashley?

00:08.400 --> 00:09.811
Look,Pop,
I know you don't want me here.

00:09.960 --> 00:11.007
Well, you know where the door is.

00:11.160 --> 00:12.924
Ruby: You've seen how powerful
my children have become.

00:13.080 --> 00:15.447
We gotta retrieve that Necronomicon
before they get their hands on it.

00:15.600 --> 00:17.762
- Where'd you put it?
- Kelly: The best hiding place

00:17.920 --> 00:20.366
you could think of
was a fucking corpse?!

00:20.520 --> 00:22.682
- (screeching)
- (Ash yelling)

00:22.840 --> 00:26.128
This town is only big enough
for one asshole... me.

00:26.280 --> 00:28.487
- We gotta get out of here.
- Kelly: Stop!

00:28.640 --> 00:30.210
Beat it.
Roads are for cars.

00:30.360 --> 00:31.805
Fuck you!
You need to watch where you're going!

00:31.960 --> 00:33.200
But I don't see the book.
Where is it?

00:33.360 --> 00:35.567
It's locked up in the Delta,
safe and sound.

00:35.760 --> 00:37.000
- Jefe, it's the Delta!
- Hey!

00:37.160 --> 00:40.084
- (howling)
- (horn honking)

00:43.360 --> 00:47.684
♪ Only you ♪

00:47.840 --> 00:53.210
♪ Cared when I needed a friend ♪

00:53.400 --> 00:59.248
♪ Believed in me

01:00.080 --> 01:02.242

01:02.400 --> 01:09.124
<i>I</i> Filled with gratitude and love... <i>I</i>

01:10.600 --> 01:11.965
Miss you, baby.

01:12.120 --> 01:13.645
Look at him.

01:13.840 --> 01:15.888
Man, that car's been with him
through thick and thin.

01:16.040 --> 01:19.362
War and peace.
It was his everything.

01:19.520 --> 01:23.161
I mean, it didn't even
have a CD player, though.

01:23.320 --> 01:25.243
True that.

01:25.400 --> 01:28.051
But he loved it.

01:28.200 --> 01:30.680
- (man yelling)
- (whistle blowing)

01:33.880 --> 01:36.690
Girl: I cannot believe you guys
jacked this from Ashy Slashy.

01:36.840 --> 01:38.808
- Are you insane?
- Boy: Oh, relax.

01:38.960 --> 01:40.883
- That's all just an urban myth.
- (coughs)

01:41.040 --> 01:43.850
Okay, not what I meant, you know.

01:44.040 --> 01:46.884
My dad's the sheriff, it's not a great
look if I get busted for grand theft auto.

01:47.080 --> 01:50.163
It's not grand theft
if the car's worth $30.

01:50.320 --> 01:52.527
(giggles) Look, I just
don't want to give my dad

01:52.680 --> 01:54.205
another reason
to get pissed off, you guys.

01:54.360 --> 01:56.761
He's been totally on edge
ever since this Ash guy came to town.

01:56.920 --> 01:58.331
Lace, don't stress.

01:58.480 --> 02:00.289
All right,
after we smoke this dude's stash,

02:00.440 --> 02:02.408
we'll dump his piece-of-shit car
somewhere.

02:02.600 --> 02:06.127
- No one will ever know about it.
- Okay, cut it out, Tyler.

02:06.280 --> 02:07.281
Sorry.

02:07.480 --> 02:09.482
It doesn't help that
your pervert friend is watching.

02:09.639 --> 02:11.210
- Lacey: Eww!
- (all chuckling)

02:11.400 --> 02:13.562
Fine, but I'm taking the weed.

02:13.720 --> 02:15.688
Wait up.

02:17.880 --> 02:20.008
- Come on, pervert.
- (music playing on radio)

02:24.720 --> 02:27.405
<i>I</i> Precious friend... <i>I</i>

02:27.560 --> 02:30.086
(both moaning)

02:33.880 --> 02:36.087
Hey, didn't your mom
used to bone Old Hatchet Hand?

02:36.240 --> 02:38.971
- Uh...
- It's a chainsaw, brah.

02:39.120 --> 02:41.168
No, they were just friends, eww.

02:41.320 --> 02:43.084
She totally banged him.

02:43.240 --> 02:47.086
She was like,
"Oh, Ashy Slashy!"

02:47.240 --> 02:49.641
- (laughing)
- Eww, cut it out! God.

02:53.400 --> 02:56.449
Uh, let's take a break.
You need to cool off.

02:56.600 --> 02:58.762
Well, hey...

02:58.920 --> 03:03.448
I think we should both be able
to express our feelings physically.

03:03.600 --> 03:07.730
Oh, God.
I've never met anyone like you.

03:10.360 --> 03:13.170
"Verata..."

03:13.320 --> 03:16.529
- (growling)
- "...kanda..."

03:18.280 --> 03:22.330
- I guess what I'm trying to say is...
- "...misartra..."

03:23.400 --> 03:26.370
- (growling)
- "...me-stro-bean."

03:27.640 --> 03:29.768
- (Amber screams)
- Oh, holy shit!

03:29.920 --> 03:31.809
What the fuck was that?!

03:33.160 --> 03:35.162
- I love you, too.
- Huh?

03:35.360 --> 03:38.364
But the car, and uh...

03:38.520 --> 03:41.842
Uh... never mind.

03:43.480 --> 03:48.407
Oh, yeah.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.164
- (Amber biting)
- Whoa! Fuck!

03:50.320 --> 03:52.084
Ah, what the fu--

03:52.600 --> 03:54.602
(music playing)

03:57.760 --> 04:00.491
- (wind blowing)
- (cat screeching)

04:03.200 --> 04:05.407
- Time to go.
- Go where?

04:05.560 --> 04:08.643
Get the Necronomicon back
before it falls into the wrong hands.

04:08.800 --> 04:11.201
- Ash: What do you think you're doing?
- Ruby: Fixing your mistake.

04:11.360 --> 04:12.850
Ash:
I don't think so, bossy.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.322
This is my team,
and they go where I tell them, not you.

04:16.519 --> 04:17.680
Forget the stupid book.

04:17.839 --> 04:19.841
Chasing that thing's
only going to give you a leg cramp.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.684
You don't know
what you're talking about.

04:21.839 --> 04:23.171
Oh, I don't?

04:23.360 --> 04:25.647
You're the one who grew up
your entire life looking for that book,

04:25.800 --> 04:27.165
and you never found it.

04:27.320 --> 04:30.688
Me on the other hand, I can't fart
without tripping over that thing.

04:30.840 --> 04:32.080
And I fart a lot.

04:32.240 --> 04:33.730
All right, then,
please tell me

04:33.880 --> 04:36.042
what is your genius plan
for getting the book back?

04:36.200 --> 04:38.202
Oh, I'll tell you.
First things first.

04:38.360 --> 04:39.441
- Uh...
- (farts)

04:45.480 --> 04:47.323
(chuckles)

04:53.560 --> 04:55.324
Kelly:
What the hell is pink fuck?

04:55.520 --> 05:00.162
Pink fuck is a proprietary mix
of liqueurs and spirits

05:00.360 --> 05:03.364
garnished with orange rind,
and, um, nutmeg.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.921
Oh, and...

05:06.880 --> 05:09.281
there's a shit ton of Ketamine in it.

05:09.440 --> 05:10.601
- (laughing)
- Got it.

05:10.760 --> 05:13.081
Uh, second question,
who the hell is this guy?

05:13.240 --> 05:16.369
Well, come on, seriously?
You've never heard me talk about Chet?

05:16.520 --> 05:18.045
"No Fret Chet?"
My main man?

05:18.200 --> 05:20.601
- My number one partner...
- Both: In crime!

05:20.760 --> 05:22.489
- Never formally charged.
- (Ash laughs)

05:22.640 --> 05:24.085
Back in high school,
me and Chet, man,

05:24.240 --> 05:26.049
we used to throw
the most righteous parties.

05:26.200 --> 05:29.249
People would come from
far and wide for a taste of sweet...

05:29.400 --> 05:31.084
Both: Pink fuck!

05:31.240 --> 05:33.925
- Here you go. Try it.
- Nah, I'm good.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.765
Uh, why not?
Are you a cop?

05:36.920 --> 05:40.811
No, dude, I just don't feel like
drinking a glass of Ketamine right now.

05:40.960 --> 05:41.961
Or ever!

05:42.120 --> 05:45.761
Ash: She's not a cop, but I have
never seen her do Ketamine.

05:45.920 --> 05:47.445
(both grunting)

05:47.600 --> 05:48.965
Uh...

05:51.360 --> 05:53.328
Solidarity!
Till the wheels fall off!

05:53.480 --> 05:56.609
(groans)
So, the sugar is hurting my teeth.

05:56.760 --> 05:59.331
And, uh, I'm pretty-- Uh...

05:59.480 --> 06:00.925
(slurred)
my tongue is numb.

06:01.080 --> 06:03.128
And it's not...

06:03.280 --> 06:05.806
(chuckfing)

06:09.440 --> 06:11.647
Hey, how about you, slim?

06:11.800 --> 06:13.802
Want to try a pink fuck,
hold the pink?

06:13.960 --> 06:15.928
Chet: Ow!

06:16.080 --> 06:19.163
(chuckfing)
Mm. This feels so nice.

06:19.320 --> 06:22.290
- That's what brings the crowds in.
- That's what I'm counting on.

06:22.480 --> 06:25.848
Chet, what do you say,
we cook up a big batch of happy,

06:26.000 --> 06:27.809
and throw one of
our epic parties tonight?

06:27.960 --> 06:29.962
And the kids who stole your car
will show up.

06:30.120 --> 06:33.010
- That's a genius plan, Jefe.
- Thanks, Pablo.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.490
It's not the worst plan.

06:35.640 --> 06:37.290
Till the wheels fall off, brother.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.488
(both vocalizing)

06:40.400 --> 06:42.767
- (both imitating explosion)
- (Kelly sighs)

06:42.960 --> 06:45.611
Both: K-hole! Yeah!

06:46.520 --> 06:48.648
Amber! Tyler!

06:48.840 --> 06:50.763
Honeymoon's over!

06:59.120 --> 07:02.602
(gasps)
Oh, my God.

07:04.120 --> 07:05.884
What's going on?

07:09.480 --> 07:12.962
Tyler? Amber?
Are you there?

07:13.160 --> 07:16.164
- (Lacey gasps)
- (Tyler groaning)

07:24.400 --> 07:25.640
Dude...

07:31.240 --> 07:32.730
- Holy...
- Shit.

07:32.880 --> 07:34.291
- Come on, let's go!
- (engine starts)

07:36.480 --> 07:37.970
(screaming)

07:38.120 --> 07:39.406
(screams)

07:43.720 --> 07:46.200
Lacey: What is... what is happening?
I'm not doing this!

07:46.400 --> 07:49.006
(engine revving)

07:49.160 --> 07:53.370
(screams) Oh, my God.
What the fuck is happening?!

07:54.080 --> 07:55.605
- No!
- (tires screeching)

07:57.160 --> 07:58.571
(Lacey screams)

07:58.720 --> 08:00.370
(Delta whirring)

08:06.120 --> 08:07.451
(gasps)

08:10.120 --> 08:11.531
(Lacey screaming)

08:15.400 --> 08:17.721
Stop it!

08:20.400 --> 08:22.562
- Come on!
- Run, Blake, run!

08:22.720 --> 08:27.044
- (music playing on stereo)
- Medication time!

08:32.600 --> 08:35.604
You know,
I got to hand it to you.

08:35.760 --> 08:38.126
This party is popping off, man.

08:38.280 --> 08:40.806
I mean,
you got the football team

08:40.960 --> 08:43.440
and cool goth kids.

08:43.600 --> 08:46.046
The fun gay guy everybody loves.

08:46.200 --> 08:48.771
Some really old men.

08:48.960 --> 08:52.089
What the rice and beans
is he doing here?

08:53.440 --> 08:55.408
What the rice and beans
are you doing here?

08:55.560 --> 08:57.642
Hey, it's my question!
Look, beat it.

08:57.800 --> 08:59.245
This is my party, Okay?

08:59.400 --> 09:03.007
It's for young, hip people,
not old guys that smell like soup.

09:03.160 --> 09:04.924
No, no, no.
This is my bar.

09:05.080 --> 09:08.641
Bert, Roy, and me been coming here
every Saturday for 40 years.

09:08.800 --> 09:11.929
You don't just waltz in here
and push me around.

09:12.080 --> 09:13.525
Come on, boys.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.489
(groans)
Story of my life.

09:15.640 --> 09:18.962
Now he's going to be a creepy old guy
and scare all the cool kids away.

09:19.160 --> 09:22.323
- Now I'll never get my car back.
- You mean your book, right?

09:22.480 --> 09:24.289
Well, of course I mean the car.

09:24.440 --> 09:27.444
(laughs)
Oh, did I say car? I meant car.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.490
Look, you wanna be part of this team?
I got your first assignment.

09:30.640 --> 09:31.846
- Kill your dad.
- Yep.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.490
No. Just distract him.

09:33.640 --> 09:36.325
Keep him away from the kids, though.
I'm gonna do some digging.

09:38.040 --> 09:40.008
Tyler, come on. Come on.

09:40.160 --> 09:42.686
- Come on.
- Oh, no, fuck!

09:42.840 --> 09:44.968
- (screaming)
- (engine revving)

09:46.000 --> 09:47.809
Fuck you!

09:47.960 --> 09:49.610
Come on, come on.
Get down, get down, get down.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.320
Lacey:
Blake, it won't stop!

09:53.480 --> 09:56.165
Fuck! Fuck, I can't!

09:56.360 --> 09:57.486
(grunts)

09:58.640 --> 10:00.881
Oh, no, no! No!

10:01.040 --> 10:03.520
- (screaming continues)
- It's coming, man.

10:03.680 --> 10:06.286
- It's going to find us!
- Not if we don't move.

10:08.320 --> 10:09.731
Oh, please don't run.

10:09.920 --> 10:11.206
Shh, shh.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.089
Stay. Don't run. Don't run.

10:15.640 --> 10:17.927
(engine sputtering)

10:18.080 --> 10:20.367
- (electricity zapping)
- (engine stops)

10:20.520 --> 10:22.170
(whispers)
It stopped.

10:28.560 --> 10:30.927
- It's definitely stopped, man, let's--
- No, don't, don't, don't.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.081
(whispers)
We gotta stay here.

10:32.240 --> 10:33.730
_ Why, man?
Why Is this happening?

10:33.880 --> 10:36.565
I don't know. I don't...

10:36.720 --> 10:39.121
eVving)

10:40.480 --> 10:43.131
- Tyler!
- Tyler, run!

10:45.200 --> 10:47.601
Okay, time for a little drinking game.

10:47.760 --> 10:50.127
Now, the rules are easy, all right?

10:50.280 --> 10:53.443
We go around, and everybody says
the worst thing they've ever done.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.921
If somebody's done that,
you take a drink.

10:56.080 --> 10:58.242
All right? Okay.
I'll go first.

10:58.400 --> 10:59.526
(chuckles)

10:59.720 --> 11:04.282
Recently, I stole a cream colored,
1973 Delta 88 Oldsmobile,

11:04.440 --> 11:07.603
with a bunch of skanky beer cans
in the back, and a creepy old book.

11:07.760 --> 11:10.411
All right, now who's done that?

11:10.600 --> 11:12.568
Nobody? Really?
Come on.

11:12.720 --> 11:14.882
Not one of you was out there
hot rodding around?

11:15.040 --> 11:16.087
Huh?

11:16.240 --> 11:18.641
Jeez, maybe I should've
picked a cooler table.

11:18.800 --> 11:22.407
- I once crashed my mother's Jetta.
- This is not about your mother's Jetta!

11:24.720 --> 11:25.960
Can I PMY?

11:26.160 --> 11:29.642
♪ Great God in heaven,
you know I love you ♪

11:29.800 --> 11:33.486
♪ Whoa, you know I do... ♪

11:33.640 --> 11:35.563
Well, that depends.

11:35.720 --> 11:38.929
- Ever do anything bad?
- No, but the night's still young.

11:39.080 --> 11:40.161
(Ash laughing)

11:44.520 --> 11:47.205
So, we can both agree this car
ain't coming back, right?

11:48.320 --> 11:49.446
" Right?
<i>'</i> (gasps)

11:49.640 --> 11:50.721
Oh, sorry.

11:52.720 --> 11:55.087
- Hey.
- You okay?

11:55.240 --> 11:57.288
Yeah, sorry.
My head's not right lately.

11:57.480 --> 12:00.131
I... I can't eat,

12:00.320 --> 12:02.926
I'm clammy,
and I haven't slept in days.

12:04.160 --> 12:06.970
I'm terrified I'm going to have
another one of my visions.

12:07.160 --> 12:10.209
- It's like looking at hell itself.
- Yo, ese.

12:10.360 --> 12:13.682
Yeah, well, um, hey, man.
I know what you're going through.

12:13.840 --> 12:16.491
You know, I mean, I had some
super dark thoughts, too,

12:16.640 --> 12:20.008
- after my time in Desert Storm.
- Oh, yeah. You were in the army?

12:20.160 --> 12:22.640
I mean, I don't like
to put labels on it.

12:22.840 --> 12:24.683
I'm not comfortable
with that, but, uh,

12:24.840 --> 12:26.888
shooting at Jihadis
affects a man, you know?

12:27.040 --> 12:30.328
- How did you get past it?
- First you have to,

12:30.480 --> 12:32.130
uh, clear your mind.

12:32.280 --> 12:34.886
And then you, uh,
check out your problems.

12:35.040 --> 12:37.281
And one by one,
and you solve them.

12:37.480 --> 12:40.165
You know?
Like, uh, friendly fire mishap.

12:42.960 --> 12:45.042
And, uh, Saudi gold.

12:47.160 --> 12:51.529
Like, uh, Anwar,
the uh, village boy.

12:51.680 --> 12:53.887
It's, uh...

12:54.080 --> 12:55.684
Mm. Your turn.

12:55.840 --> 12:59.208
Okay, please don't listen
to that numbnuts.

12:59.360 --> 13:02.569
Everyone in this world
is plagued by something evil.

13:02.760 --> 13:06.526
You can pour a drink
and you can ignore it.

13:06.720 --> 13:10.486
Or you can stand up
and you can fight it.

13:10.680 --> 13:13.160
Okay, so fight it, man.
Fight your evil.

13:13.320 --> 13:15.402
Yeah, you're right.

13:16.480 --> 13:18.608
I gotta be more like you.
I got to be strong.

13:18.760 --> 13:21.570
Man, you-you don't let
anything get to you.

13:21.720 --> 13:23.688
So, what does that mean?

13:23.840 --> 13:25.569
It means you just roll
with the punches.

13:25.720 --> 13:30.044
You don't need a job,
a boyfriend, or a home.

13:30.240 --> 13:33.926
- Well, I mean, I have a home.
- No, like a stationary home.

13:34.120 --> 13:37.920
You... you don't need anything
to define your worth.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.969
It's impressive.

13:42.400 --> 13:45.085
Yeah, yeah.
It's, uh, it's...

13:45.240 --> 13:47.129
it's definitely impressive.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.201
Thank you.

13:51.440 --> 13:54.284
- Fuck are you doing?
- Just being impressive.

13:54.440 --> 13:56.568
Look how impressive I am!

13:56.720 --> 13:59.644
(panting)

14:01.120 --> 14:03.361
(yelling)

14:03.520 --> 14:05.648
Come on, Tyler! Go!

14:05.800 --> 14:07.643
- (yelling continues)
- Come on.

14:07.800 --> 14:09.484
Tyler: Oh, no!

14:09.640 --> 14:13.326
(screams)

14:22.160 --> 14:24.003
(beeping)

14:29.520 --> 14:32.046
Tyler: God, no, no!

14:35.760 --> 14:37.524
(screaming)

14:55.480 --> 14:57.084
No! Oh, my God!

14:58.920 --> 14:59.967
(screaming)

15:00.120 --> 15:03.090
Man on radio:
Delta has just hit an all time high.

15:06.600 --> 15:09.285
Lacey: No!

15:09.440 --> 15:13.126
- (indistinct chatter, laughter)
- Woman: Hey, girl.

15:14.960 --> 15:16.803
Hey, there you are.

15:16.960 --> 15:18.530
You look cute.

15:18.680 --> 15:21.206
(indistinct conversations)

15:25.440 --> 15:26.851
- (music playing)
- Girls: Trick or treat!

15:27.000 --> 15:29.321
Halloween?
No, you didn't!

15:29.480 --> 15:31.403
Uaughs)

15:31.560 --> 15:34.211
I'm trying to think of something bad,
but I'm such a good girl.

15:34.360 --> 15:35.486
Oh, come on.

15:35.640 --> 15:37.688
You must have one,
teeny, tiny, little flaw.

15:37.840 --> 15:40.491
Well, I did break up
with my boyfriend earlier tonight.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.210
- Oh.
- Uh, that's not how this game...

15:42.360 --> 15:43.566
<i>"</i> Shh!

15:43.720 --> 15:45.051
Talk to me, Amber.

15:45.200 --> 15:48.249
I don't know what my idiot son
did to land a piece like you.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.926
Blink twice if you're here
against your will.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.526
Strangely,
I'm here of my own volition.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.769
For reasons outside my control,
I need your son.

15:56.920 --> 16:01.164
It's barely visible, but there's something
inside him which makes him...

16:01.320 --> 16:02.526
special.

16:02.680 --> 16:04.569
Is this a biological clock thing?

16:04.720 --> 16:07.564
'Cause basically, Ash and I
have the same "baby formula"

16:07.720 --> 16:08.881
down in the old crotch bottle.

16:09.040 --> 16:11.407
Oh, yeah.
(chuckles)

16:11.560 --> 16:12.607
Mm.

16:12.760 --> 16:14.888
What are you doing?

16:15.040 --> 16:17.122
Just want to see
Bigfoot's big old feet.

16:18.880 --> 16:21.406
Ruby: Okay, that's it.

16:21.560 --> 16:23.289
- (Brock grunting)
- Apologize.

16:23.440 --> 16:25.966
- I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Uh, hold that thought.

16:26.920 --> 16:28.888
What the hell is going on?

16:29.040 --> 16:31.247
You know,
I'm done playing it your way.

16:31.400 --> 16:34.404
From now on, you keep
your gene pool away from me.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.927
- Okay, what'd you do?
- Nothing.

16:37.080 --> 16:40.562
She was waving me in
like a damn air traffic controller.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.961
- I thought she liked me.
- Nobody likes you.

16:43.120 --> 16:44.804
That's why I didn't want you
at this party.

16:44.960 --> 16:49.045
Well, I wanted to die without laying eyes
on my disappointment of a kid again.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.567
- But them's the breaks.
- Yeah?

16:51.720 --> 16:54.291
Well, I'm not a kid anymore.
I'm a man.

16:54.440 --> 16:57.364
What do you say we settle
our differences like men?

16:59.240 --> 17:01.447
What do you got in mind?

17:01.600 --> 17:04.079
(cheering)

17:04.960 --> 17:06.803
Yeah, Jefe, urn,

17:07.000 --> 17:09.445
why not just have
a real conversation with your pops,

17:09.599 --> 17:12.285
and then we can get back to looking
for the book and the Delta.

17:12.440 --> 17:15.090
Pablo, talking is for talkers.

17:15.240 --> 17:17.925
People who talk.
I'm a doer.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.809
Now, friend, kindly step aside

17:19.960 --> 17:22.804
and let this great eagle soar
on the back of that bull.

18:44.240 --> 18:48.404
And since I wasted all that time
following Ash's dumb plan,

18:48.600 --> 18:51.649

I got a plan B.

19:16.840 --> 19:18.126
What?

19:18.280 --> 19:21.284
Look, we might not
be able to find the book,

19:21.440 --> 19:24.410
but we can go after the ones
who are searching for it, the spawn,

19:24.600 --> 19:27.570
and take them out before
they can even summon up Baal.

19:27.720 --> 19:29.131
Come with me.

19:29.280 --> 19:32.887

19:33.920 --> 19:35.888
Kelly...

19:36.360 --> 19:38.044
You're some immortal ass kicker,

19:38.200 --> 19:41.283
yet you call Ash for help.

19:41.440 --> 19:45.604
- I want to know why.
- I needed help.

19:45.760 --> 19:48.923
You've seen what my children
can do to me alone.

19:49.120 --> 19:53.091
But now I'm starting to see that
it wasn't Ash I was meant to call.

19:53.240 --> 19:55.402
It was you.

19:59.120 --> 20:01.726
Help me.

21:09.160 --> 21:10.969

21:11.160 --> 21:13.401
You got to clench those cheeks
together nice and tight.

21:26.880 --> 21:29.201
There's no winners
when you play catch, Pop.

21:29.360 --> 21:32.011
You just throw the ball
back and forth, and you bond.

21:32.160 --> 21:35.687
Yeah, well, I did my best, son,
but somewhere along the line, I lost you.

21:35.840 --> 21:37.365
Yeah, like the day I was born.

21:37.560 --> 21:40.723
No, the day you went
to that cabin and...

21:40.880 --> 21:44.009
And what?
Go ahead, say it.

21:44.160 --> 21:46.242
We're both thinking the same thing.
Say it.

21:46.400 --> 21:49.051
And killed those kids.

21:49.240 --> 21:51.208
And?

21:51.360 --> 21:53.124
And Cheryl.

21:53.280 --> 21:55.567
You took my daughter from me,
goddamn you.

21:55.720 --> 21:57.722
You think I killed Cheryl?

21:57.880 --> 21:59.609
You think I killed my own sister?

21:59.760 --> 22:01.603
What do you want me to believe?
That it was the monsters?

22:01.760 --> 22:03.569
Yeah, Dad, 'cause it's the truth.

22:03.720 --> 22:06.451
Goddamn it, for once in your life,
take some responsibility.

22:06.600 --> 22:08.568
You're the monster, Ash.
You killed them all.

22:08.760 --> 22:10.888
And then you took off,
and left me here to die alone.

22:11.040 --> 22:12.804
I had no choice, Dad.

22:12.960 --> 22:16.089
You were a miserable son of a bitch.

22:16.240 --> 22:18.242
You know that's why
Mom left you, right?

22:19.320 --> 22:21.766
Nothing you can say can hurt me.

22:21.920 --> 22:24.844
You already broke my heart.

22:29.440 --> 22:31.010
Come on, sweetheart.

22:36.920 --> 22:39.400
Never should've come to
this stupid town, Pablo.

22:39.560 --> 22:42.564
Yeah, we didn't pick it.
Evil did.

22:44.600 --> 22:47.968

22:48.120 --> 22:50.043

Okay, this is your plan?

mung)

23:19.800 --> 23:21.802

Please, just let him go.

24:02.640 --> 24:04.244
Stop!

24:05.320 --> 24:07.402
You can't just sit there.

24:07.560 --> 24:08.846
Yes, I can.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.684
My plan failed.

24:10.880 --> 24:13.042
I didn't get the car back.
Didn't get the book back.

24:13.200 --> 24:16.170
- Didn't get the girl.
- Because she was a Deadite.

24:16.320 --> 24:19.881
There's no such thing as a Deadite.
Haven't you talked to my father?

24:20.040 --> 24:22.361
According to him,
I'm the monster.

24:22.560 --> 24:24.449
Mm. I'm the killer.

24:24.600 --> 24:25.931
Mm.

24:26.080 --> 24:28.162
I'm just a lying sack of lard!

24:29.200 --> 24:32.443
Okay, you cannot
just sit there on a stool,

24:32.600 --> 24:34.568
and drink your demons away,
all right?

24:34.720 --> 24:36.768
You got to confront them.
Life doesn't work that way.

24:36.920 --> 24:39.526
Listen, you got to march
into that bathroom,

24:39.680 --> 24:41.091
and you got to show your pops

24:41.240 --> 24:43.527
you're not the guy
that he thinks you are.

24:43.680 --> 24:46.729
You're Ash Williams,
demon hunter,.

24:46.920 --> 24:49.241
Deadite slayer,
friend, hero,

24:49.400 --> 24:51.323
and Jefe.

24:52.320 --> 24:56.769
Okay, I think it's time you introduced
Brock to that great eagle.

24:56.920 --> 24:59.526
(breathing heavily, squawks)

25:00.840 --> 25:02.604
(Squawks)

25:02.760 --> 25:04.364
(in slurred speech)
Hey, sorry, here you go.

25:04.560 --> 25:06.881
- Go, huh, hey-hey, sorry!
- What are you doing?

25:07.040 --> 25:09.646
You're so much better at this
than my dead wife.

25:09.800 --> 25:12.406
(gasping)
Whoa, ho.

25:12.560 --> 25:16.451
- Do you want to know a secret?
- I'd rather you not talk, but sure.

25:16.600 --> 25:18.921
I fucking hate dirty old men.

25:19.120 --> 25:20.610
- What?
- (growling)

25:20.760 --> 25:21.921
(yells) Help!

25:22.120 --> 25:24.168
(distorted)
Don't you want me anymore, Daddy?

25:24.320 --> 25:25.731
- Help!
- (chainsaw buzzing)

25:29.080 --> 25:30.491
Holy shit!

25:32.240 --> 25:34.163
"_Ash?
- Hiya, Pop.

25:34.320 --> 25:37.324
- Got room for a threesome?
- Oh, shit.

25:42.280 --> 25:44.886
(distorted) I'm warning you.
I like it rough.

25:58.040 --> 26:00.611
You're a dirty, dirty girl, Amber.

26:24.960 --> 26:28.203
Believe it or not, Dad,
this is my day job.

26:28.360 --> 26:30.886
Holy shit.

26:36.840 --> 26:38.080
(door opens)

26:39.760 --> 26:41.489
(screams)
It's Ashy Slashy!

26:41.640 --> 26:43.369
Brock: No, no, no, no.
Wait, kid.

26:43.520 --> 26:46.205
Ashy Slashy's going to kill us all!

26:46.360 --> 26:48.567
Hey, relax!
Everything's fine!

26:48.720 --> 26:51.883
- (crowd screaming)
- Don't run, you idiots.

26:52.040 --> 26:54.168
He's going to save us, don't run.

26:56.880 --> 26:59.884
Stop, you damn morons!
My son is a hero!

27:00.040 --> 27:01.963
You hear me?
He's a hero!

27:02.560 --> 27:04.688
You really mean that, Dad?

27:06.840 --> 27:09.525
You think I'm a hero?

27:09.680 --> 27:11.603
Of course I do.

27:11.760 --> 27:13.205
Oh, Ashley.

27:13.400 --> 27:16.324
L-I've wasted so many years
being wrong about you.

27:18.360 --> 27:19.885
One more time?

27:20.040 --> 27:23.328
(sighs)
I was wrong.

27:25.560 --> 27:28.723
But relieved to see what
an honorable man you've become.

27:29.880 --> 27:32.247
Because there's something
I've kept from you.

27:32.400 --> 27:35.927
- What is it, Pop?
- Something so vital that...

27:36.080 --> 27:38.560
the fabric of your life may begin...

27:38.760 --> 27:41.240
- (Lacey screaming)
- (horn honking)

27:41.400 --> 27:43.289
Oh, Dad!

27:43.440 --> 27:45.602
No! Oh, no!

27:45.760 --> 27:47.125
No!

Hey, you knuckleheads,
Ash Williams here.

28:45.800 --> 28:47.962
If someone offers you
a drink of pink fuck,

28:48.160 --> 28:50.481
throw it away,
'cause it's bad shit.

28:50.640 --> 28:53.883
It will mess with your brain,
and not in the good way.

28:54.600 --> 28:57.251
Be smart,
and stay safe out there.
