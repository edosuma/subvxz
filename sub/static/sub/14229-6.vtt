The Kingdom of Cordoba.

01:13.750 --> 01:14.920
So, you excited?

01:14.920 --> 01:16.540
Are you kidding?

01:16.540 --> 01:18.710
Building this bridge between
Avalor and Cordoba

01:18.710 --> 01:21.040
is my first
big royal project.

01:21.040 --> 01:24.380
It'll make travelling between
the kingdoms so much faster.

01:24.380 --> 01:28.620
I just have to figure out
exactly where to build it.

01:28.620 --> 01:29.790
You have any ideas?

01:29.790 --> 01:32.710
Oh, just a few.

01:32.710 --> 01:34.210
I like doing my research.

01:35.580 --> 01:39.080
Well, if Prince Alonso
is half as prepared as you are,

01:39.080 --> 01:40.790
finding a good spot
should be easy.

01:44.120 --> 01:47.330
Welcome to Cordoba,
Crown Princess Elena.

01:47.330 --> 01:49.670
The pleasure is all mine,
King Juan Ramon.

01:49.670 --> 01:52.500
It is an honor to have you
in our kingdom.

01:52.500 --> 01:55.540
Everyone has heard about
how you rescued your people
from Shuriki.

01:55.540 --> 01:57.290
You are quite
an impressive young lady.

01:57.290 --> 01:59.500
Oh, it's what any ruler

01:59.500 --> 02:01.500
would have done for her people,
Your Highness.

02:01.500 --> 02:05.170
I am so glad that you will
be working on this project
with Prince Alonso.

02:05.170 --> 02:07.540
I hope you will be
a good role model for him.

02:07.540 --> 02:08.580
He can use one.

02:08.580 --> 02:10.540
Oh. Is he here?

02:10.540 --> 02:14.460
Whoa! Yee-haw!
Outta my way!

02:21.750 --> 02:24.330
Well, hey there.
I'm Alonso.

02:24.330 --> 02:26.540
Prince Alonso.

02:26.540 --> 02:28.830
Nice to meet you,
I'm Princess--

02:28.830 --> 02:30.540
Elena. I know.

02:30.540 --> 02:33.580
Your oil painting
does not do you justice.

02:33.580 --> 02:35.920
Yes, well, now that
we know who we are

02:35.920 --> 02:37.210
and what
we look like,

02:37.210 --> 02:38.500
we should
get started.

02:38.500 --> 02:40.210
You two have
a lot of work to do.

02:40.210 --> 02:41.790
Let me show you
to the throne room.

02:45.080 --> 02:47.540
Here. Take care of her bags,
will you?

02:47.540 --> 02:49.170
Ahh...

02:49.170 --> 02:51.710
The throne room
is right this way.

02:51.710 --> 02:53.580
I love all
the tapestries.

02:53.580 --> 02:55.750
Ah, they depict
important moments

02:55.750 --> 02:56.960
in Cordoba's history,

02:56.960 --> 02:58.750
as well as some
famous legends.

02:58.750 --> 03:00.750
Looks like
a bunch of old rugs

03:00.750 --> 03:01.880
hanging on
the wall to me.

03:01.880 --> 03:04.750
You'll have
to excuse my son.

03:04.750 --> 03:06.710
He has never had
much interest in history.

03:06.710 --> 03:09.790
I'm more of a live-in-the-moment
type of prince.

03:09.790 --> 03:12.040
Besides, who can look
at tapestries

03:12.040 --> 03:13.670
when the greatest
work of art

03:13.670 --> 03:15.210
is standing right
before us?

03:15.210 --> 03:16.250
What is that?

03:16.250 --> 03:18.040
Some people call it poetry.

03:18.040 --> 03:20.250
No. I mean that.

03:20.250 --> 03:21.670
Is that a giant?

03:21.670 --> 03:24.380
That wooden giant
is called the Yacalli.

03:24.380 --> 03:26.210
Legend says that
he scares off people

03:26.210 --> 03:27.960
who wander
into his territory.

03:27.960 --> 03:30.420
Oh. And what about this one
with the cute little owls?

03:30.420 --> 03:34.330
Ah, they are called "buhitos".
You can only find them
in Cordoba.

03:34.330 --> 03:38.250
Indeed, there are
so many things that
you'll only find in Cordoba.

03:38.250 --> 03:42.380
And, it would be my pleasure
to take you on a tour of the
kingdom to see all of them.

03:42.380 --> 03:44.330
But first things first.

03:44.330 --> 03:46.380
ELENA: Wow!

03:46.380 --> 03:48.380
This bridge is
the perfect combination

03:48.380 --> 03:49.920
of Avaloran
and Cordoban style.

03:49.920 --> 03:52.210
I am delighted
to hear you say that.

03:52.210 --> 03:54.330
I feel the same way.

03:54.330 --> 03:56.580
Well then, I will leave it
up to you two

03:56.580 --> 03:58.880
to find the perfect location
to build it.

03:58.880 --> 04:01.420
Ready for that
tour of Cordoba?

04:01.420 --> 04:03.670
But what about choosing
a site for the bridge?

04:03.670 --> 04:06.580
A member of the staff
can take care of that for us.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.290
But it's our job.

04:08.290 --> 04:09.670
We shouldn't give it
to someone else.

04:09.670 --> 04:11.830
Of course.
Please, forgive me.

04:11.830 --> 04:13.790
How would you like to proceed,
Princess?

04:13.790 --> 04:17.420
Well, let's compare our lists
of potential bridge sites. Hmm?

04:17.420 --> 04:19.250
Oh, why yes.
Absolutely.

04:19.250 --> 04:21.210
Please. My list.
Let me, um...

04:21.210 --> 04:23.460
But where are my manners?
Ladies first.

04:23.460 --> 04:24.750
Let's start
with your list.

04:24.750 --> 04:25.960
Okay.

04:25.960 --> 04:28.540
My first site is
the closest distance

04:28.540 --> 04:29.790
between our two kingdoms.

04:29.790 --> 04:31.750
It's the meadow next
to the San Prado River.

04:31.750 --> 04:34.920
I know exactly where that is.
We'll take my chariot!

04:41.000 --> 04:43.380
Sorry, but my chariot
only seats two.

04:43.380 --> 04:45.580
I'm the Crown Princess's
Royal Guard.

04:45.580 --> 04:47.290
Wherever she goes,
I go.

04:47.290 --> 04:49.750
Of course. Of course.
Where are my manners?

04:49.750 --> 04:52.920
You can follow us
on... Pedro.

04:52.920 --> 04:54.080
Pedro?

04:56.920 --> 04:58.580
Wait. There's no way--

04:58.580 --> 04:59.880
H'yah!

05:07.880 --> 05:10.790
Ah, here we are,
the San Prado River.

05:10.790 --> 05:13.210
Bright, sparkling,
mysterious.

05:13.210 --> 05:15.460
In many ways
it's like... me.

05:17.170 --> 05:20.330
Is that a buhito?

05:20.330 --> 05:23.120
Yes, but I can show you
far more majestic sights

05:23.120 --> 05:25.040
once we begin our tour.

05:25.040 --> 05:28.710
After we choose the location
for the bridge, okay?

05:28.710 --> 05:30.420
Now I chose this site

05:30.420 --> 05:32.540
because the river
is really narrow here.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.750
So it would save us time
and materials.

05:34.750 --> 05:36.620
Perfect,
we'll build here.

05:36.620 --> 05:37.670
Whew. I don't know
about you,

05:37.670 --> 05:39.580
but I really
worked up an appetite.

05:39.580 --> 05:41.830
Hmm... What are
those dirt mounds?

05:41.830 --> 05:44.040
It doesn't matter because
they will soon be gone.

05:44.040 --> 05:46.380
Guards.
We will dig here!

05:46.380 --> 05:48.790
- You should tell him.
- I'm not gonna tell him.

05:48.790 --> 05:50.710
Oh, wait. Is there
something wrong?

05:50.710 --> 05:53.750
Well, Princess,
the local farmers say

05:53.750 --> 05:57.290
that if you build in this area,
you will awaken the Yacalli.

05:57.290 --> 05:58.790
The Yacalli?

05:58.790 --> 06:00.420
The wooden giant
from the tapestry?

06:00.420 --> 06:02.000
Yes, but that's
just an old legend.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.210
It's not real.

06:03.210 --> 06:05.620
Has anyone seen
this Yacalli?

06:05.620 --> 06:07.500
Well, no...

06:07.500 --> 06:10.380
Yes, no one has seen him
because he does not exist.

06:10.380 --> 06:11.620
Shall we go?

06:11.620 --> 06:13.080
I know a perfect spot
for a picnic.

06:13.080 --> 06:14.580
PEDRO:

06:14.580 --> 06:16.420
Gabe! You made it.

06:16.420 --> 06:17.830
Sorry, Princess.

06:17.830 --> 06:20.420
The ride took longer
than expected.

06:20.420 --> 06:22.080
Yes, it is hard
keeping up

06:22.080 --> 06:23.960
with the fastest chariot
in the kingdom.

06:23.960 --> 06:27.330
Only because I have
the slowest horse
in the kingdom.

06:27.330 --> 06:29.620
Well, you're just in time, 'cos
we're about to break ground.

06:29.620 --> 06:33.460
Actually, I was thinking
we should check out
some other sites.

06:33.460 --> 06:36.790
We wouldn't want
to awaken the Yacalli.

06:36.790 --> 06:39.580
Ah! Don't let some old stories
scare you, Elena.

06:39.580 --> 06:41.670
Trust me, this is
the perfect place.

06:42.790 --> 06:44.460
Excellent whistle,
Your Highness!

06:44.460 --> 06:45.790
Yes, I know.
I've been practicing.

06:45.790 --> 06:47.170
Call in the workers!

06:58.790 --> 07:01.920
Hmm. Huh?

07:01.920 --> 07:04.420
See, Princess?
No Yacalli.

07:04.420 --> 07:06.210
I guess you were right,
Prince Alonso.

07:06.210 --> 07:07.830
Now for that tour.

07:07.830 --> 07:10.790
I'd love a tour after
we've finished our job.

07:10.790 --> 07:12.620
Our job was to pick
the spot for the bridge,

07:12.620 --> 07:14.250
not stand here and
watch them build it.

07:14.250 --> 07:16.620
I was thinking we should
at least supervise them

07:16.620 --> 07:18.580
for a little while
to make sure they're doing--

07:18.580 --> 07:20.290
Elena, I'm just
looking out for you.

07:20.290 --> 07:22.830
It's important to have
a balance of work and fun.

07:22.830 --> 07:24.620
Or do you not like
to have fun?

07:24.620 --> 07:26.670
I have fun
all the time.

07:26.670 --> 07:29.670
You wouldn't believe the jokes
we tell around the castle.

07:29.670 --> 07:31.710
- Are you sure you want to--

07:31.710 --> 07:33.750
Why did the cookie
go to the doctor?

07:33.750 --> 07:36.380
Because he felt crummy!

07:41.460 --> 07:42.500
My grandma thought
it was funny.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.750
Yeah!

07:44.750 --> 07:46.790
Oh, it is hilarious,
alright.

07:46.790 --> 07:49.790
But I'm talking about more
than telling jokes, Elena.

07:49.790 --> 07:52.040
When was the last time
you took a real break?

07:52.040 --> 07:53.830
A whole day of
nothing but fun.

07:53.830 --> 07:55.620
Well, um...

07:55.620 --> 07:57.330
You know...

07:57.330 --> 08:00.170
I'm pretty sure I have one
scheduled for next week.

08:00.170 --> 08:02.580
You can be serious
when you're an adult.

08:02.580 --> 08:04.080
When you're young
like us,

10:32.960 --> 10:34.120

10:34.120 --> 10:35.540
Perfect?

10:35.540 --> 10:36.540
Yes.

10:37.790 --> 10:38.750
All right, men!

10:38.750 --> 10:42.540
Let's start clearing out
the mounds of dirt.

10:43.790 --> 10:45.670
ALL:

10:56.790 --> 10:58.620
The legend is real!

10:58.620 --> 10:59.750
It's the Yacalli!

11:04.250 --> 11:06.000
Good morrow,
gentlemen.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.750
I would be
ever so grateful

11:07.750 --> 11:09.620
if you would leave
this area immediately.

11:09.620 --> 11:11.460
However, if you
choose not to,

11:11.460 --> 11:13.580
I will have to break
all of your equipment

11:13.580 --> 11:16.420
and cause much unnecessary
unpleasantness.

11:16.420 --> 11:19.210
No, men.
Keep on digging!

11:21.120 --> 11:23.670
Well, unpleasantness it is.

11:30.500 --> 11:32.420
ALL:

11:32.420 --> 11:35.670
GUARDS:

11:35.670 --> 11:38.120
ALONSO: Now this
is the life.

11:38.120 --> 11:40.290
No work.
No worries.

11:40.290 --> 11:43.580
- Just me, you and--
- Me.

11:43.580 --> 11:45.880
Your timing
is impeccable.

11:45.880 --> 11:47.620
Princess Elena.

11:47.620 --> 11:48.960
You've been here a while.

11:48.960 --> 11:50.380
Shouldn't you head back
to the, uh...

11:50.380 --> 11:51.710
...bridge site now?

11:51.710 --> 11:53.170
Oh. Right.

11:53.170 --> 11:55.000
We should check up
on the progress. Mm-hmm.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.670
But we haven't
finished our lunch.

11:56.670 --> 11:57.790
Please stay.

11:57.790 --> 11:58.880
There's nothing
to worry about.

11:58.880 --> 12:00.750
My men are taking
good care of it.

12:00.750 --> 12:04.790
GUARD: Prince Alonso!

12:04.790 --> 12:05.830
The workers have
awakened the Yacalli!

12:05.830 --> 12:07.080
!

12:07.080 --> 12:08.120
The Yacalli is just
an old story.

12:08.120 --> 12:10.920
Well, that old story
just wrecked our work site.

12:10.920 --> 12:12.790
That's terrible!

12:12.790 --> 12:14.790
Oh! I knew we shouldn't
have left.

12:14.790 --> 12:16.210
But our picnic!

12:16.210 --> 12:19.380
How can you think
of food at a time like this?

12:19.380 --> 12:21.580
And, how did I let you
talk me into this?

12:21.580 --> 12:24.790
Well, I am very persuasive
and extremely irresistible.

12:24.790 --> 12:26.920
Uh... not that
irresistible.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.580
Let's just go.

12:28.580 --> 12:31.330
- H'yah!

12:31.330 --> 12:32.920
- Princess, wait!

12:32.920 --> 12:34.170
Oh, come on!

12:42.750 --> 12:44.960
The Yacalli is real?

12:44.960 --> 12:46.710
Good day.

12:46.710 --> 12:48.500
I hate to
inconvenience you,

12:48.500 --> 12:50.290
but your presence
is not welcome here.

12:50.290 --> 12:52.380
Kindly leave the premises
at once.

12:52.380 --> 12:53.790
We're so sorry.

12:53.790 --> 12:54.790
We're leaving
right now.

12:54.790 --> 12:55.920
Leave?

12:55.920 --> 12:57.330
We will not leave.

12:57.330 --> 12:59.330
I am the Prince
of this kingdom

12:59.330 --> 13:01.120
and no one will tell me
what to do.

13:01.120 --> 13:04.380
If I want to stay,
I stay!

13:08.460 --> 13:10.330
I deeply regret
to inform you

13:10.330 --> 13:12.040
that since you
destroyed this home,

13:12.040 --> 13:15.620
I must now destroy
your most glorious residence.

13:15.620 --> 13:18.710
Senor Yacalli, we had
no idea this was your home

13:18.710 --> 13:20.710
and we're very sorry
for disturbing it.

13:20.710 --> 13:22.580
This is not my home,

13:22.580 --> 13:24.620
but thank you
for your kind words.

13:24.620 --> 13:26.330
Hmm, let me see.

13:26.330 --> 13:28.000
If memory serves me
correctly,

13:28.000 --> 13:30.830
the Palacio Rosado
is due east.

13:30.830 --> 13:33.000
Quick! Guards,
do something!

13:34.000 --> 13:35.540
GUARDS: Yes, Your Highness!

13:38.500 --> 13:40.620
Uh-uh-uh,
I'll take those.

13:40.620 --> 13:43.580
Please forgive me for having
to resort to such measures,

13:43.580 --> 13:46.750
but you are making
bad choices,

13:46.750 --> 13:48.330
not-so-gentlemen.

13:48.330 --> 13:51.120
Let us take
our leave, friends.

13:54.170 --> 13:56.420
Princess Elena,
are you okay?

13:56.420 --> 13:57.710
I'm fine,

13:57.710 --> 13:59.620
but the Yacalli is off
to destroy the palace.

13:59.620 --> 14:02.330
What do we do,
Prince Alonso?

14:02.330 --> 14:04.790
I, uh...
I don't know.

14:04.790 --> 14:07.620
Princess Elena, you're all work
and no fun, what should we do?

14:07.620 --> 14:10.000
The first thing we need to do
is warn your father.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.790
Good idea.
To my chariot!

14:11.790 --> 14:14.210
You've done enough.
Come on, Gabe.

14:14.210 --> 14:16.790
Wait! What about me?!

14:16.790 --> 14:18.580
Sorry.
Only seats two.

14:18.580 --> 14:20.120
H'yah!

14:28.790 --> 14:30.330
Look, there he is!

14:34.790 --> 14:37.120
Friends, I would be
forever in your debt

14:37.120 --> 14:39.540
if you could please assist me
in travelling more speedily.

14:42.330 --> 14:43.580
Whee!

14:45.080 --> 14:47.120
Please tell me
you saw that.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.500
Why are the buhitos
helping the Yacalli?

14:49.500 --> 14:52.380
I don't know, but we
better pick up the pace.

14:55.790 --> 14:57.420
Princess Elena,
what's wrong?

14:57.420 --> 14:59.580
The Yacalli is coming
to destroy the palace!

14:59.580 --> 15:01.960
What? I thought the Yacalli
was just a legend.

15:01.960 --> 15:03.960
Oh, he's very real,
Your Highness.

15:03.960 --> 15:05.620
And surprisingly polite.

15:05.620 --> 15:08.580
Wait. Is he polite or coming
to destroy the palace?

15:08.580 --> 15:11.620
- BOTH: Both.
- Then, we must defend
the Palacio Rosado.

15:11.620 --> 15:13.710
Fetch Captain Rivas
at once!

15:13.710 --> 15:16.580
Come on,
we're almost there.

15:16.580 --> 15:17.960
Ugh.

15:17.960 --> 15:18.920
Oh, forget it.

15:18.920 --> 15:20.620
- Father!
- Hey!

15:20.620 --> 15:22.120
The workers
woke the Yacalli!

15:22.120 --> 15:24.540
That's not what happened,
Your Highness.

15:24.540 --> 15:28.000
It was Alonso who upset
the Yacalli, not the workers.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.620
Things would've been okay if we
had just apologized and left.

15:31.620 --> 15:32.710
Is this true, son?

15:32.710 --> 15:34.620
Of course not.

15:34.620 --> 15:36.580
If you think about it,
it really--

15:36.580 --> 15:38.750
This is actually all
Princess Elena's fault

15:38.750 --> 15:41.750
since she's the one who picked
the site in the first place.

15:41.750 --> 15:44.790
The truth is,
it's both our faults.

15:44.790 --> 15:46.920
I did choose the site,
Your Majesty.

15:46.920 --> 15:49.880
But I wanted to leave
after I heard about the Yacalli.

15:49.880 --> 15:52.080
I should've trusted
my instincts.

15:52.080 --> 15:53.920
Hmm. I see.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.790
Thank you for your honesty,
Princess Elena.

15:58.170 --> 16:00.420
Why would you believe a stranger
over your own son?!

16:00.420 --> 16:03.000
Because I know my son
all too well.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.500
- Captain Rivas.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.580
The palace is about
to be attacked by the Yacalli.

16:07.580 --> 16:09.620
- Set up a perimeter
around the palace.

16:09.620 --> 16:11.250
I want two lines of defense.

16:11.250 --> 16:13.080
And we need to get everyone
in the palace to safety.

16:13.080 --> 16:15.380
Right away,
Your Majesty!

16:15.380 --> 16:17.710
ALL;

16:22.120 --> 16:25.330
I am most appreciative
of your assistance
with my arrival,

16:25.330 --> 16:27.040
my winged friends.

16:27.040 --> 16:28.210
BUHITOS:

16:30.710 --> 16:32.460
Stand your ground, men!

16:34.790 --> 16:35.580
ALL:

16:35.580 --> 16:37.000
Stay close!

16:37.000 --> 16:38.540
I'll take you
somewhere safe.

16:41.420 --> 16:43.620
Princess Elena,
we've got to keep moving.

16:43.620 --> 16:46.540
The Yacalli is here! He's
breaking through our defenses!

16:46.540 --> 16:49.250
Alonso, lead Princess Elena
and her guard to safety.

16:49.250 --> 16:50.620
I must defend the palace.

16:50.620 --> 16:52.120
Yes, Father.

16:52.120 --> 16:53.120
Follow me!

16:53.120 --> 16:54.210
Gabe, look.

16:54.210 --> 16:55.790
See how the Yacalli
has one arm

16:55.790 --> 16:57.120
stretched out towards
those villagers?

16:57.120 --> 16:58.170
I do.

16:58.170 --> 16:59.790
So what? Let's go.

16:59.790 --> 17:02.120
See how his other arm
goes off the edge?

17:02.120 --> 17:04.620
The rest of it
is in that tapestry.

17:04.620 --> 17:07.250
The buhitos are sitting
on the Yacalli's arm.

17:07.250 --> 17:09.460
It's just
a tree branch.

17:09.460 --> 17:12.620
No, it's his arm.
Look.

17:12.620 --> 17:13.790
Whoa.

17:13.790 --> 17:15.790
Seriously?
How is any of this important?

17:15.790 --> 17:18.580
The Yacalli is standing
in between the buhitos

17:18.580 --> 17:21.460
and the villagers.
That's his job.

17:21.460 --> 17:24.620
To protect the buhitos!
That's why he's so upset.

17:24.620 --> 17:27.580
Because we were destroying
the buhitos' homes.

17:29.580 --> 17:32.170
I think I know how
to save the palace!

17:32.170 --> 17:33.710
ALONSO: Now what are you doing?

17:33.710 --> 17:35.620
The palace is
under attack!

17:35.620 --> 17:37.920
We need to evacuate
immediately!

17:37.920 --> 17:39.920
I hate to agree with him,
but he has a point.

17:39.920 --> 17:41.710
ELENA: Look, I don't have
time to explain,

17:41.710 --> 17:43.380
so you've got to trust me.

17:43.380 --> 17:45.460
I have an idea and
I need your help to do it.

17:45.460 --> 17:46.540
Are you with me?

17:46.540 --> 17:48.420
I'm always with you.

17:48.420 --> 17:49.580
Great!

17:49.580 --> 17:50.790
Get me straw,
a bucket of water

17:50.790 --> 17:52.000
and a cart, please.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.620
You got it, Princess.

17:53.620 --> 17:56.670
Wait. Princess Elena,
you need to be somewhere safe,

17:56.670 --> 17:58.250
not out here
digging in the dirt.

17:58.250 --> 18:00.580
It's reckless and not how
a royal behaves.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.250
This is exactly
how a royal behaves.

18:03.250 --> 18:04.620
We serve our people.

18:04.620 --> 18:06.580
As a prince,
who will rule someday,

18:06.580 --> 18:08.120
you should know that.

18:08.120 --> 18:11.000
Okay. I tried.
I'm outta here.

18:14.380 --> 18:16.420
- Pardon me.

18:16.420 --> 18:17.620
Help!

18:23.500 --> 18:26.620
You have my most heartfelt
apologies for the commotion.

18:26.620 --> 18:28.460
Whoa! Whoa!

18:28.460 --> 18:30.080
And property damage.

18:30.080 --> 18:31.960
Fall back, men!
Fall back!

18:31.960 --> 18:33.330
Out of the way!
Coming through!

18:33.330 --> 18:35.620
Princess Elena,
what are you still doing here?

18:35.620 --> 18:36.790
It's not safe!

18:36.790 --> 18:38.420
I'm sorry, Your Highness,

18:38.420 --> 18:40.750
but I think I know
how to stop the Yacalli--

18:40.750 --> 18:42.120
without fighting.

18:42.120 --> 18:44.540
HORSE:

18:44.540 --> 18:46.330
GUARDS:

18:46.330 --> 18:47.920
Upsy-daisy.

18:47.920 --> 18:50.250
I really hope
this plan works.

18:50.250 --> 18:52.380
Me too.

19:01.540 --> 19:03.210
Look.

19:03.210 --> 19:04.500
BOTH: Aww.

19:04.500 --> 19:06.460
GUARDS: Aww.

19:08.580 --> 19:10.670
Senor Yacalli,
we had no idea

19:10.670 --> 19:12.580
those dirt mounds
were the buhitos' homes,

19:12.580 --> 19:15.170
and we're sorry for
what happened to them.

19:15.170 --> 19:17.000
So, we built this burrow

19:17.000 --> 19:19.830
to replace the first one
we accidently destroyed.

19:19.830 --> 19:22.580
And we just need
a little more time

19:22.580 --> 19:26.040
to build a second burrow and
bring them both to the meadow.

19:26.040 --> 19:27.580
Hmm...

19:27.580 --> 19:30.250
I... I admire you
for doing your duty.

19:30.250 --> 19:33.250
You're a good example
for all of us.

19:35.790 --> 19:38.040
On behalf
of the buhitos,

19:38.040 --> 19:40.380
I accept your apology.

19:40.380 --> 19:43.460
And on behalf
of the people of Cordoba,

19:43.460 --> 19:46.540
I promise an incident like this
will never happen again.

19:50.670 --> 19:54.580
This royal proclamation hereby
declares that "Buhitos' Meadow"

19:54.580 --> 19:57.120
is the official home
of the buhitos,

19:57.120 --> 19:59.710
not to be disturbed
by anyone.

20:04.540 --> 20:06.620
They love their new home!

20:06.620 --> 20:09.380
You have my eternal gratitude,
Princess.

20:09.380 --> 20:12.040
And now, I must return
from whence I came.

20:21.420 --> 20:23.540
Goodbye,
Senor Yacalli.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.710
Hey, congratulations,
Princess.

20:30.710 --> 20:32.120
You get to spend
the rest of the day

20:32.120 --> 20:34.710
touring Cordoba with me.

20:36.120 --> 20:37.960
We still have to pick out
a site for the bridge.

20:37.960 --> 20:40.420
I will help you pick the site,
Princess Elena.

20:40.420 --> 20:43.790
I have another job
for Prince Alonso.

20:43.790 --> 20:46.380
You do?
What kind of job?

20:48.710 --> 20:50.040
This isn't funny.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.540
I'm a prince!

20:51.540 --> 20:53.460
A prince is supposed
to ride over a bridge,

20:53.460 --> 20:54.670
not help build one!

20:54.670 --> 20:56.830
A prince serves
his people,

20:56.830 --> 20:58.620
and right now
this is the best way

20:58.620 --> 21:00.750
for you to serve
your people.

21:00.750 --> 21:02.960
That's it!
I've had enough.

21:02.960 --> 21:04.170
Wait! Don't go.

21:04.170 --> 21:06.170
I can go
if I please.

21:07.580 --> 21:09.620
And that's what
I was trying to tell you.

21:09.620 --> 21:11.460
Guards!

21:11.460 --> 21:12.620
Get me out of here!

21:14.460 --> 21:18.120
Maybe when he learns
to whistle, huh?

21:18.120 --> 21:19.880
I can't thank you enough

21:19.880 --> 21:21.670
for what you've done
for Cordoba, Princess Elena.

21:21.670 --> 21:23.670
I look forward
to seeing you again

21:23.670 --> 21:25.380
once the bridge
is completed.

21:25.380 --> 21:26.790
As do I.

21:26.790 --> 21:28.540
I sincerely hope
that my son understands

21:28.540 --> 21:31.290
what it means
to be a prince by then.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.880
Thank you,
King Juan Ramon.

21:33.880 --> 21:36.170
Coachman,
take us to the port.

21:36.170 --> 21:37.960
Coachman, please ignore
that order.

21:37.960 --> 21:39.120
Yes, Your Highness.

21:39.120 --> 21:41.080
But Princess,
the Royal Cruiser is waiting.

21:41.080 --> 21:42.580
And it can wait
a bit longer.

21:42.580 --> 21:45.920
We finished our job, so now
we deserve a little break.

21:45.920 --> 21:47.420
Let's tour the kingdom.

21:47.420 --> 21:48.420
Are you sure?

21:48.420 --> 21:50.000
Yeah. We're young.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.500
We should have
a little fun.

21:51.500 --> 21:53.120
You're right.
After all...

21:53.120 --> 21:56.120
I'm a live-in-the moment
type of Royal Guard.

21:56.120 --> 21:57.670
BOTH:

21:59.460 --> 22:02.290
BUHITOS:

22:02.290 --> 22:04.420

22:07.790 --> 22:10.040
