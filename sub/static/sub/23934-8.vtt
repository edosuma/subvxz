<i>If al-Qaeda did this,
it is an act of war.</i>

00:12.304 --> 00:14.341
The FBI will collaborate
with the Yemen government

00:14.431 --> 00:16.218
<i>and make
as small a footprint as possible.</i>

00:16.308 --> 00:18.174
- Who the fuck's in charge here?
- I am.

00:18.936 --> 00:19.926
Who are you?

00:27.236 --> 00:29.979
He's saying that
if you want to know about the house,

00:30.072 --> 00:33.361
talk to Quso or long name.

00:33.742 --> 00:36.029
You give me reason, I give you Quso.

00:36.245 --> 00:37.952
I need you to clear a path for us.

00:38.205 --> 00:41.323
Seventeen dead Americans!
Their blood's gonna be on your hands.

00:46.421 --> 00:48.663
Ask him
if it's for a guy named Khallad.

00:55.681 --> 00:58.298
I found about the man
you want. Khallad.

00:58.392 --> 01:01.430
I'm having a bit of a problem here,
with one of your guys.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.178
<i>Truth is, I'm in sort of a bind.</i>

01:03.438 --> 01:05.349
I thought you said
his girlfriend's name was Liz.

01:05.482 --> 01:06.893
<i>The one I met was named Liz.</i>

01:07.025 --> 01:10.018
Well, you'd better tell her
the truth about your wife.

01:10.279 --> 01:12.145
That problem we recently discussed?

01:15.409 --> 01:17.776
- Our problem.
- It's being taken care of.

01:22.833 --> 01:25.416
<i>I want to rely on you</i>

01:25.669 --> 01:28.662
to fix things for us in America.

01:29.131 --> 01:30.417
I'm at your service.

02:02.247 --> 02:03.658
<i>Good evening.</i>

02:03.749 --> 02:06.412
<i>Just moments ago,
I spoke with George W. Bush,</i>

02:06.501 --> 02:10.996
<i>and congratulated him on becoming
the 43rd President of the United States.</i>

02:11.131 --> 02:13.999
<i>"I, George Walker Bush,
do solemnly swear..."</i>

02:14.092 --> 02:16.379
<i>I, George Walker Bush,
do solemnly swear...</i>

02:16.470 --> 02:17.927
<i>"...that I will faithfully execute</i>

02:18.013 --> 02:20.221
<i>"the office of
President of the United States."</i>

02:20.307 --> 02:21.423
<i>...that I will faithfully execute</i>

02:21.558 --> 02:24.050
<i>the office of President
of the United States.</i>

02:24.186 --> 02:26.929
<i>I count myself
extremely fortunate to be back,</i>

02:28.106 --> 02:30.393
<i>and have the opportunity
to serve a new president.</i>

02:30.609 --> 02:32.475
<i>I thank you so much
for the confidence you've placed in me,</i>

02:33.820 --> 02:36.437
<i>for the honor you do me.</i>

02:37.949 --> 02:40.817
<i>Honored by your call to service
and looking forward to it.</i>

02:40.911 --> 02:44.871
<i>It's gonna be a lifetime very rewarding.
Thank you, sir.</i>

02:55.008 --> 02:58.843
- She canceled?
- New assistant. All his fault.

02:58.929 --> 03:01.296
- How's next week?
- How about now?

03:02.182 --> 03:06.017
Rest assured, she's making time
for an interview with <i>Vogue.</i>

03:06.103 --> 03:08.846
First African-American
woman National Security Advisor.

03:09.022 --> 03:12.186
Yeah, it's a big deal. I get it.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.726
Get me Condoleezza Rice
on the phone right now, please.

03:15.946 --> 03:17.903
Annie Leibovitz will photograph.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.901
They called me for a quote.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.116
She doesn't get it. None of them do.

03:22.285 --> 03:24.868
Every new administration
must be brought up to speed

03:24.955 --> 03:27.038
on the current
national security climate.

03:27.165 --> 03:29.703
Eight years ago, with Bush Sr.,
it was all about the Russians.

03:29.793 --> 03:31.329
Right? So, now, it is again.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.621
Anything Clinton cared about
must have been bullshit.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.752
He went north? We'll go south.

03:36.842 --> 03:39.004
Meanwhile, the threat matrix
is through the roof.

03:39.094 --> 03:40.585
That's what I'm trying to tell her.

03:40.679 --> 03:42.295
Try harder.

03:42.389 --> 03:45.678
Get their attention.
Scare the shit out of 'em.

03:46.393 --> 03:47.383
Yeah.

03:55.986 --> 03:57.193
She will call me back.

03:58.989 --> 04:02.073
Sure. She's a busy lady.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.825
<i>And if you are justjoining us,
we have breaking news to tell you</i>

04:04.911 --> 04:08.825
<i>about a terrorist convicted
of 213 counts of murder</i>

04:08.915 --> 04:12.283
<i>in the 1998 bombing
of the American embassy in Kenya,</i>

04:12.461 --> 04:17.297
<i>will be sentenced to life in prison
without the possibility of parole.</i>

04:17.382 --> 04:20.216
Yes! Yes! Chesney!

04:20.385 --> 04:22.798
Chesney! Chesney! Chesney!

04:27.726 --> 04:31.970
Justice was served.
So much time, so much effort. A hero.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.937
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:35.859 --> 04:40.274
The American justice system worked.
You should all sleep very well tonight.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.237
This is all you. Are you proud?

04:42.324 --> 04:44.031
I couldn't have done it
without Kathy and Floyd.

04:44.576 --> 04:45.737
Oh.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.489
Go back to work!

04:48.413 --> 04:50.905
Now, they're gonna want to make
a martyr out of him.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.661
Listen, I put in a request.

04:52.751 --> 04:55.835
You're gonna do a
language school intensive, learn Arabic.

04:56.505 --> 04:57.712
I don't want to do that.

04:57.798 --> 05:01.166
You learned Romanian, didn't you?
It can't be as hard as Romanian.

05:01.551 --> 05:04.669
It's too late for me. I'm coming up
on retirement, same as you.

05:04.888 --> 05:08.052
So what? They're not gonna
push you out the door. They need you.

05:09.768 --> 05:12.385
When it comes, I'll be ready to go.

05:17.192 --> 05:20.776
I know. I know. Don't worry.

05:21.947 --> 05:24.360
It's a good idea. Ah.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.069
No, of course.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.749
He's here right now. I'll ask him.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.544
Okay, then. Bye-bye.

06:06.324 --> 06:09.237
But, Dad,
you can't have another one until midday.

06:09.619 --> 06:12.487
I know it hurts.

06:15.041 --> 06:18.910
Yes, okay. I promise I'll call
the doctor. I'll see you later.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.377
- Okay.
- Thank you.

06:20.505 --> 06:23.543
<i>The aircraft is controlled
from the cockpit, or flight deck.</i>

06:23.633 --> 06:26.626
<i>The pilot sits in the left seat,
and the copilot sits to the right,</i>

06:26.720 --> 06:28.632
<i>with the control column
located in the center.</i>

06:29.347 --> 06:30.963
<i>In front of them
is the instrument panel,</i>

06:31.057 --> 06:32.389
<i>containing the flight controls</i>

06:32.475 --> 06:34.512
<i>enabling a smooth and safe flight.</i>

06:34.603 --> 06:37.220
<i>The pilot and copilot
examine the aircraft logs</i>

06:37.314 --> 06:38.896
<i>and verify that all the controls
are in the proper position...</i>

06:49.367 --> 06:52.860
<i>Even as a kid, I knew
most Americans really didn't get it.</i>

06:53.079 --> 06:57.699
<i>They didn't understand
how the world worked. What was fake,</i>

06:57.876 --> 07:02.246
<i>and what was a bullshit distraction
from the way things really were,</i>

07:02.380 --> 07:05.339
<i>corrupt, evil.</i>

07:05.592 --> 07:07.675
<i>I knew there were
good guys and bad guys,</i>

07:08.887 --> 07:11.595
<i>and I wanted to be one of the good guys.</i>

07:12.015 --> 07:16.259
But at the same time,
I appreciate I can be overzealous.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.010
I also appreciate that sometimes,

07:18.104 --> 07:21.643
the right thing to do,
is to turn the other cheek.

07:21.733 --> 07:24.100
You pulled me out of Yemen,
in the middle of an investigation.

07:24.194 --> 07:26.311
I'm not gonna ask why,
or what that's about.

07:26.488 --> 07:29.652
I'm just here to tell you
that the investigation was going well.

07:29.741 --> 07:33.451
I picked the right case agent, too.
Soufan's young, but he's whip-smart.

07:33.536 --> 07:37.246
Presumably, the Yemenis trust him.
He's from around there, correct?

07:37.415 --> 07:39.077
He was born in Lebanon.
They don't trust him

07:39.167 --> 07:42.080
any more than they trust any American.
Less, maybe.

07:42.170 --> 07:45.004
But in spite of this,
he was the right man for the job.

07:45.674 --> 07:46.664
If you say so.

07:47.008 --> 07:49.250
I made personal connections
with some of the key players,

07:49.344 --> 07:52.052
got some leads, but they know more.

07:52.138 --> 07:55.552
Like to get back over there before
they forget how much they like me.

07:55.684 --> 07:56.765
So, when am I going back?

07:58.436 --> 07:59.472
You're not.

07:59.854 --> 08:01.766
You've been denied re-entry into Yemen.

08:04.859 --> 08:07.943
- Who did that?
- Ambassador Bodine.

08:08.029 --> 08:11.773
Apparently, you didn't make personal
connections with all the key players.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.486
Did she say why?

08:13.743 --> 08:17.487
She said a lot of things,
but reading between the lines,

08:17.622 --> 08:20.239
I'd say she thought
you were kind of an asshole.

08:35.472 --> 08:37.385
Khallad rented the house
the bombers stayed in.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.759
We have to assume he was running
the operation on the ground.

08:39.852 --> 08:42.470
And we also have to acknowledge
that's an assumption.

08:42.605 --> 08:44.015
So, what do we know for sure?

08:44.190 --> 08:45.351
One leg.

08:45.442 --> 08:47.525
Fantastically
identifiable characteristic.

08:47.861 --> 08:51.354
He traveled from Malaysia to Bangkok
to meet Quso.

08:51.448 --> 08:54.907
Quso told you he gave him 36 grand.
Said it was for a new leg.

08:54.993 --> 08:56.234
Which I do not believe.

08:56.327 --> 08:58.364
And I'm taking
a second run at Quso later.

08:58.580 --> 08:59.866
Good deal.

09:00.123 --> 09:02.740
Have you talked
to your people at Langley?

09:02.834 --> 09:04.166
I told them what we're looking for.

09:04.836 --> 09:06.953
Yeah, I also told them
what we're looking for,

09:07.130 --> 09:10.089
but did you get an answer?
'Cause I didn't.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.388
He read in his <i>Lonely Planet Yemen</i>

09:18.475 --> 09:21.343
that the best food here
was the street food.

09:21.436 --> 09:22.426
So white.

09:24.731 --> 09:27.474
You asked them
for any information about Khallad,

09:27.567 --> 09:30.651
or anything on the Malaysia meeting,
the take from the Hada phone?

09:31.154 --> 09:32.736
Yup.

09:33.531 --> 09:38.276
And you told them we can't move forward
until they quit stonewalling?

09:38.828 --> 09:41.912
I didn't put it like that exactly,
but, yeah, basically.

09:42.624 --> 09:43.614
And?

09:44.751 --> 09:47.585
So, yeah, as you predicted,

09:47.670 --> 09:50.538
absolutely, there were phone calls
made from Quso's hotel room in Bangkok,

09:50.632 --> 09:52.043
to the Hada phone in Yemen,

09:52.133 --> 09:53.920
and from there
to a payphone in Malaysia.

09:55.804 --> 09:58.296
Wait, Chihoyne,
you kind of buried the lede.

09:58.723 --> 10:01.215
We're getting those transcripts?

10:01.309 --> 10:03.141
No.

10:03.228 --> 10:06.346
I mean, they're not passing anything on.
They're saying it's not pertinent.

10:06.815 --> 10:08.226
"Not pertinent"?

10:08.316 --> 10:09.932
What the fuck does that mean?

10:10.026 --> 10:11.938
If they've got something,
it's pertinent.

10:12.362 --> 10:15.321
- I don't know, man.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

10:15.406 --> 10:18.240
Why am I going through you
if you can't get any fucking answers?

10:19.160 --> 10:22.653
- Fucking bureaucrat.
- Why don't you take it down a notch?

10:23.039 --> 10:25.622
A bunch of Americans
got blown out of the water

10:25.708 --> 10:28.746
and shipped home in pieces,
but let's take it down a notch

10:28.878 --> 10:32.087
because the Agency is the Agency,
and what are you gonna do?

10:32.215 --> 10:33.672
Look, Ali... Ali, just...

10:33.758 --> 10:35.920
Aw, come on,
let's take it down a notch, Floyd.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.368
They all get their period
at the same time, or something?

11:16.593 --> 11:19.336
Yes, I saw Agent Soufan's cable.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.386
We were wondering if you'd like us

11:21.472 --> 11:24.055
to pull the relevant intel,
draft a response.

11:24.726 --> 11:27.184
If Leonard Bliss
wants a response drafted

11:27.270 --> 11:28.806
and you are required in that effort,

11:28.897 --> 11:30.854
then you will be alerted at that time.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.644
In the meantime,
should we let Agent Soufan know...

11:33.735 --> 11:35.943
In the meantime, you will continue
with what you were doing

11:36.029 --> 11:37.565
before he interrupted.

11:38.156 --> 11:40.990
We get hundreds of cables a day,

11:41.075 --> 11:45.410
and we do not dash off responses
like flighty coeds.

11:45.496 --> 11:47.738
I should get back to work.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.245
I don't want to dash anything off,

11:51.336 --> 11:53.578
but obviously,
his request is time-sensitive.

12:02.430 --> 12:05.047
The Bureau and the CIA were established

12:05.141 --> 12:09.385
as two distinct and separate
organizations for security reasons.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.557
We don't always have the same goals,

12:11.648 --> 12:14.766
and sometimes,
our goals conflict with each other.

12:14.943 --> 12:16.809
It is my belief and the belief
of my colleagues that...

12:16.945 --> 12:20.188
Schmidt? He doesn't work here anymore.

12:21.282 --> 12:23.114
...that there is no reason

12:23.201 --> 12:25.318
on God's green Earth
to jeopardize our own missions

12:25.411 --> 12:27.403
by solving the Bureau's crimes for them.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.623
How about this?

12:38.716 --> 12:43.006
Let's find out why
I-49 wants this information.

12:43.388 --> 12:46.756
Let's find out what they know already,
and we'll go from there.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.508
Sound good?

13:36.316 --> 13:37.352
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

13:37.483 --> 13:41.853
- Can I have one more hour, please?
- Uh, sure. It's not booked till 5:00.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.274
Thank you.

14:16.939 --> 14:18.521
I'll be right there.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.488
Hi, Toni-Ann.

14:26.657 --> 14:28.489
Listen, tomorrow,

14:28.618 --> 14:32.828
I want you to take these photographs
to your G-men buddies over at I-49

14:32.914 --> 14:35.281
and see if they recognize anyone.

14:37.502 --> 14:39.664
Well, I recognize al-Mihdhar.

14:40.421 --> 14:41.912
But will they?

14:42.006 --> 14:45.090
It's important that
we understand what they know.

14:45.301 --> 14:47.668
That way,
we can assess what information is,

14:47.929 --> 14:50.296
or isn't pertinent to their inquiries.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.014
And if they know nothing?

14:53.684 --> 14:55.425
Then come and tell me that.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.045
Hmm?

16:45.671 --> 16:49.665
- They gave you a day pass, huh?
- Can't wait for parole.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.048
I bet.

16:51.177 --> 16:54.045
You recognize
any of these goobers?

16:54.138 --> 16:55.470
Nope. Who are they?

16:56.140 --> 16:57.381
You don't recognize them?

16:57.558 --> 16:58.890
Should I? Who are they?

17:00.770 --> 17:03.604
This is Khalid al-Mihdhar.

17:05.942 --> 17:08.355
What the fuck is this,
"Quid pro quo, Clarice"?

17:08.444 --> 17:10.151
Who are the others?

17:11.571 --> 17:13.733
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

17:14.157 --> 17:16.400
No, they just want me
to see if you guys know.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.117
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
But they know, right?

17:18.204 --> 17:19.740
These are their photographs.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.157
Yeah, I assume.

17:21.415 --> 17:24.954
- You assume? You didn't fucking ask?
- It doesn't work like that.

17:25.086 --> 17:26.417
- What the fuck, Toni-Ann?
- All right, all right.

17:26.503 --> 17:28.211
So, this is al-Mihdhar.
What else do you got?

17:28.297 --> 17:29.378
You got a birth date?

17:31.008 --> 17:32.624
- No.
- You got a passport number?

17:32.718 --> 17:34.459
- No.
- These are fucking useless.

17:34.595 --> 17:36.803
Okay. So, thanks for the help.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.256
You come in here.
You show us these photographs.

17:39.350 --> 17:41.216
- You won't say why.
- I don't know why!

17:41.310 --> 17:43.427
They keep this shit up,
more people are gonna get killed.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.020
- It's fuckin' pathetic.
- What the fuck is this?

17:45.106 --> 17:46.222
Got any other
fucking photographs?

17:46.315 --> 17:47.726
Whose side are you on?

17:47.858 --> 17:51.351
The fucking Agency
is turning our own people against us.

17:51.445 --> 17:54.028
You got a complaint? Write it up,
you put it through the proper channels.

17:54.365 --> 17:57.574
Okay, yeah.
I'll go out and buy myself a stamp.

17:57.702 --> 17:58.818
How about you drop the attitude?

17:58.953 --> 18:01.036
How about you show some loyalty
to your men?

18:02.164 --> 18:04.156
Where the fuck is John?
He should've been here today.

18:04.292 --> 18:05.954
He got called to D.C.

18:06.961 --> 18:08.042
How convenient.

18:10.006 --> 18:11.087
I bet he did.

18:11.257 --> 18:15.217
Hey, Bob. Forget John!
I'm your boss!

19:13.069 --> 19:14.059
Exactly.

19:50.231 --> 19:51.221
I don't know.

20:03.202 --> 20:06.070
If Mr. American Ali
doesn't want to talk anymore,

20:06.914 --> 20:08.701
let us end this conversation.

20:11.252 --> 20:12.663
Great.

20:13.838 --> 20:14.874
Take him away.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.874
He never even met bin Laden.

20:44.493 --> 20:48.237
When you showed me the list of suspects
held here, in Yemen,

20:48.330 --> 20:51.164
Abu Jandal was on that list, correct?

20:52.626 --> 20:53.867
How can I remember?

20:54.503 --> 20:58.338
I remember. Get him.

20:58.507 --> 20:59.497
Now.

20:59.717 --> 21:02.710
Unfortunately, that won't be possible.

21:04.472 --> 21:06.805
You want me to go to Qamish again?

21:06.891 --> 21:08.257
Embarrass you again?

21:11.896 --> 21:17.062
Go to who you like.
No one will let you speak to Abu Jandal.

21:38.255 --> 21:42.374
Are you giving her a ride?
Did her car break down?

21:49.350 --> 21:50.932
Amy approached me with some concerns

21:51.018 --> 21:53.476
regarding Mr. Ali Soufan's
recent correspondence

21:53.646 --> 21:58.858
and your instructions as to response,
or lack thereof.

21:59.610 --> 22:00.976
She approached you?

22:02.488 --> 22:04.605
She was concerned
you wouldn't take her seriously,

22:05.032 --> 22:06.989
whereas, I think
I've developed a reputation

22:07.117 --> 22:10.781
among some of the analysts
as having a somewhat avuncular energy.

22:11.956 --> 22:12.946
Oh, have you?

22:13.123 --> 22:15.911
She raises some good questions.
I assured her you'd be reasonable.

22:18.379 --> 22:21.213
I appreciate that the Bureau
and the Agency play different roles,

22:21.549 --> 22:23.461
but at the same time,
international terrorism

22:23.551 --> 22:25.213
may call for some adjustment

22:25.302 --> 22:27.919
in terms of how we deal
with intelligence issues.

22:28.347 --> 22:32.512
- I think that's very interesting.
- The FBI has an intelligence branch.

22:33.394 --> 22:37.138
But it's hard for me to see a downside.
Am I missing something?

22:37.231 --> 22:38.767
If we tell the FBI everything,

22:38.858 --> 22:41.020
they will run around the world
arresting minor players,

22:41.277 --> 22:45.487
often minor players from Saudi Arabia.
There will be headlines.

22:45.573 --> 22:48.111
Mr. and Mrs. Smith
from Shitsburgh, Pittsburgh,

22:48.200 --> 22:50.658
will be outraged
by America's special relationship

22:50.744 --> 22:52.155
with the Saudi royal family.

22:52.246 --> 22:56.536
After all, the Saudis harbor terrorists,
or so the FBI says.

22:56.625 --> 23:00.869
And the fundamentalists in Saudi Arabia
will be equally angry

23:00.963 --> 23:03.797
because clearly,
the Americans seek a war on Islam.

23:03.966 --> 23:06.299
Royal heads will roll.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.172
Fundamentalists will overrun the Palace,

23:08.262 --> 23:10.049
and their brethren
throughout the Middle East

23:10.139 --> 23:11.755
and beyond will be emboldened.

23:11.849 --> 23:14.387
Civil wars every which way.

23:14.476 --> 23:18.846
Iran, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Pakistan.

23:19.815 --> 23:23.149
And as the blood dries
and fanatics rule the East,

23:23.694 --> 23:26.437
Mr. and Mrs. Smith
will be chowing down on their cereal,

23:26.530 --> 23:29.944
not yet understanding
that a seismic shift

23:30.034 --> 23:31.775
just took place
in the political structure

23:31.869 --> 23:34.532
of the Earth and they are fucked.

23:36.874 --> 23:38.831
Our job is very simple.

23:39.376 --> 23:41.584
Saudi Arabia must never go down.

23:41.670 --> 23:45.334
We have a delicate but very

23:45.424 --> 23:47.290
special relationship.

23:50.846 --> 23:53.088
Oh. Look at that.

23:53.557 --> 23:56.095
I'm low on gas.

23:56.185 --> 24:00.680
I see. I'm sorry.
Thank you for your time.

24:01.231 --> 24:03.689
You're tired. Take a sick day tomorrow.

24:05.277 --> 24:08.270
Actually, take the week.

24:21.001 --> 24:23.869
How often should a married couple
be making love?

24:35.766 --> 24:39.305
Radicalism prospers
in the gap between rising expectations

24:39.395 --> 24:41.011
and declining opportunities,

24:41.438 --> 24:44.727
especially where
the population is largely impoverished,

24:44.817 --> 24:46.353
where the art is impoverished,

24:46.443 --> 24:49.652
and where the men
are largely separated from the women.

24:50.447 --> 24:54.691
That is why we believe we are seeing
an abundance of it in the Middle East,

24:54.952 --> 24:59.367
as well as North Africa, Central Asia,
Pakistan, Afghanistan.

24:59.498 --> 25:03.412
The origins of Islamic fundamentalism,
we can save for another day.

25:03.544 --> 25:05.957
- But it's impossible to understand...
- Richard.

25:06.880 --> 25:07.870
Question?

25:08.298 --> 25:12.042
I have a lot of work to do.
The President has a lot of work to do.

25:12.136 --> 25:15.254
So, what I need from you today,
is the short version.

25:17.182 --> 25:18.673
How are you going
to advise the president

25:18.767 --> 25:20.508
if you just skim the CliffsNotes?

25:20.602 --> 25:23.891
I'd like to do a second degree.
I really would. I like to study.

25:23.981 --> 25:26.473
But I don't have time.
I have another meeting in a half hour.

25:27.234 --> 25:29.317
I told Reed
you should clear the morning.

25:29.403 --> 25:31.986
And I told Reed
you do not dictate my schedule.

25:32.072 --> 25:34.439
Reed? Turn the lights back on.

25:34.575 --> 25:38.159
Please do not blow off the research.
You need to understand this.

25:38.245 --> 25:41.079
We're talking about
the current greatest threat

25:41.206 --> 25:44.074
- to national security...
- Then let's keep this very simple.

25:44.168 --> 25:45.158
Who are they?

25:47.171 --> 25:49.834
Who's who? Who's al-Qaeda?

25:50.007 --> 25:51.498
- Right.
- That's precisely

25:51.633 --> 25:53.340
what I'm trying to explain to you.

25:55.137 --> 25:57.880
You reported directly
to President Clinton, did you not?

25:58.766 --> 26:00.849
I did. And President Clinton...

26:00.934 --> 26:04.427
You won't be needed
to report directly to President Bush.

26:04.563 --> 26:08.398
Take the deep dives. That's your job.
But when you put something in writing,

26:08.650 --> 26:12.064
if you want it to get to the President,
keep it pithy.

26:15.491 --> 26:17.608
- "Pithy"?
- Well, on point.

26:17.701 --> 26:20.364
Like I said, everyone's very busy.

26:25.626 --> 26:27.993
Abu Jandal has nothing
to do with the <i>Cole</i> bombing.

26:36.470 --> 26:37.927
Speak in English, please.

26:38.013 --> 26:40.221
- I like to practice.
- Fine.

26:40.891 --> 26:43.008
Let's speak in English.

26:43.102 --> 26:45.014
Your English is excellent, by the way.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.726
Flattery.

26:48.899 --> 26:51.983
You think flattery
will get you Abu Jandal?

26:52.111 --> 26:53.101
It will not.

26:53.654 --> 26:55.145
Why can't I speak to him?

26:56.240 --> 26:58.197
Because there is no need.

27:00.536 --> 27:01.652
Ah.

27:01.745 --> 27:04.032
You've spent your life among soldiers,

27:06.041 --> 27:09.330
protecting them,
risking your life for them.

27:10.254 --> 27:14.749
The men on the <i>Cole</i> were soldiers,
young soldiers.

27:14.842 --> 27:16.128
Won't you help them?

27:17.386 --> 27:21.471
First flattery, now, guilt.

27:21.890 --> 27:26.009
I'm surprised you didn't bring me
more of Brother John's cigars.

27:29.523 --> 27:34.143
Brother John says,
"Let Brother Ali talk to Abu Jandal."

27:40.534 --> 27:42.947
I'm sad to not do you this favor.

27:44.454 --> 27:45.661
You don't seem sad.

27:47.291 --> 27:50.034
My guess is, you are happy.

27:50.169 --> 27:52.126
You are happy because by denying me,

27:52.212 --> 27:54.795
you're making
the Yemeni government happy.

27:56.216 --> 27:57.707
And they'll reward you.

27:59.428 --> 28:01.215
What are you gonna get?

28:01.513 --> 28:05.427
Another medal? Bigger house?

28:10.564 --> 28:12.305
Tell me something.

28:12.399 --> 28:13.640
Did you commit to memory

28:13.734 --> 28:15.851
all of the prisoners
held in Yemeni jails?

28:16.111 --> 28:19.946
That name's
particularly easy to remember.

28:21.325 --> 28:23.817
It means "father of death."

29:09.915 --> 29:12.623
Ooh, gorgeous, Arnold.

29:12.709 --> 29:14.325
That looks excellent.

29:14.628 --> 29:15.744
Why a giraffe?

29:15.837 --> 29:16.918
Mmm.

29:17.798 --> 29:19.710
Well, I know why giraffes make me happy.

29:24.554 --> 29:27.843
- Um, I have to take this.
- Okay.

29:29.810 --> 29:30.891
Hello?

29:31.228 --> 29:33.311
It's me. How are you?

29:33.480 --> 29:37.850
- What's wrong? What happened?
<i>- Nothing's happened.</i>

29:37.943 --> 29:39.104
But we said you'd only call me

29:39.194 --> 29:40.810
when I'm at work
if there's an emergency.

29:41.238 --> 29:43.605
<i>That's why I leave the phone on.
That's why I bought the phone.</i>

29:43.740 --> 29:46.073
I know. There's no emergency. I...

29:48.078 --> 29:52.743
I mean, I just got a break, and I'm...
Sorry. I'll go.

29:52.916 --> 29:54.782
No, no, no. I just...

29:56.169 --> 29:58.456
How are you? Is everything okay?

29:58.755 --> 30:01.589
Totally fine. How are you?

30:02.801 --> 30:07.171
<i>What are you doing right now?
How are the kids?</i>

30:07.264 --> 30:09.256
They're... They're great.

30:09.349 --> 30:12.592
We're painting pictures
of what happiness looks like right now.

30:13.228 --> 30:14.969
I assume you painted me.

30:19.735 --> 30:20.725
How's Yemen?

30:21.695 --> 30:22.685
<i>Right.</i>

30:23.196 --> 30:24.812
You still won't say
that's where you are.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.776
Can't say.

30:27.367 --> 30:29.905
You can't say.

30:31.496 --> 30:33.203
Are you close to catching anybody?

30:34.291 --> 30:37.910
Hey, you know what?
I can't fucking talk about that.

30:38.003 --> 30:39.335
Why would you even ask me that?

30:39.463 --> 30:41.705
- I'm sorry. I just...
- Hey, just go teach, okay?

30:42.132 --> 30:44.966
<i>I shouldn't have called.
You didn't even want me to call.</i>

30:45.052 --> 30:47.044
No, you're right. I didn't. I'm working.

30:47.387 --> 30:51.097
Yeah, me, too.
And I'm doing my fucking best, okay?

30:54.728 --> 30:56.060
Hello?

30:56.646 --> 30:57.762
She hang up on you?

30:59.733 --> 31:01.565
That's crazy.

31:01.902 --> 31:03.518
You were being so charming.

31:06.990 --> 31:09.607
Come on, man. Let's go back inside.

31:16.666 --> 31:20.159
I mean, what am I supposed to do?
Turn the other cheek?

31:20.921 --> 31:23.709
Be a lamb? You know
what that means. Be passive?

31:23.799 --> 31:28.214
No. Jesus never asks us to be passive.

31:28.345 --> 31:30.428
I gotta figure something out.
They're coming for me.

31:30.514 --> 31:32.506
I don't know why, but they are.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.475
- And how...
- You know what? I do know why.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.051
Office politics.

31:37.312 --> 31:39.554
I was never one
for office politics, you know?

31:39.648 --> 31:41.059
I always told people,
"You can either love me

31:41.149 --> 31:43.061
"or hate me, but your life
will be easier if you love me."

31:45.278 --> 31:48.191
I guess that isn't working anymore.

31:49.324 --> 31:51.156
So, fine, I, you know...

31:52.744 --> 31:57.409
I gotta deal with it,
kiss up to these guys,

31:57.541 --> 31:59.032
treat them like a jealous girlfriend,

31:59.126 --> 32:02.164
buy them flowers, talk pretty,
you know?

32:02.254 --> 32:05.622
Crazy waste of time
when lives are on the line.

32:07.259 --> 32:09.592
Well, how are the things
in your personal life?

32:10.011 --> 32:14.972
Professional troubles never seem so bad
if the home is a safe harbor.

32:16.476 --> 32:17.762
Listen.

32:19.980 --> 32:23.098
The world's in chaos. Okay?

32:26.903 --> 32:29.611
Men screw everything up.

32:32.742 --> 32:36.486
I know I'm part of that.
We both know I'm part of that.

32:40.292 --> 32:43.251
But I'm trying to put things right.

32:44.921 --> 32:47.914
Do you want to make a confession?

32:55.307 --> 32:59.517
Oh, God! Oh, God, Johnny.

32:59.728 --> 33:02.220
Oh, Johnny. Oh, Johnny.

33:02.355 --> 33:06.725
Oh, God! Johnny! Oh, I love you!
I love you, Johnny.

33:06.943 --> 33:11.278
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

33:15.952 --> 33:17.193
You can't blow these out.

33:17.454 --> 33:19.696
- Careful, honey.
- Make a wish, girls.

33:35.347 --> 33:36.337
John?

33:39.476 --> 33:40.466
Honey?

33:42.354 --> 33:44.141
I'm fine.

33:45.649 --> 33:47.481
Everything's fine.

33:53.782 --> 33:55.239
Yo, we leave at 6:00, Ali.

33:55.992 --> 33:57.153
Yeah, Mommy, I know.

33:57.244 --> 34:00.612
He's got to get his girl something nice.
She's pissed at him.

34:01.331 --> 34:05.325
My dad was a cop.
Worked a ton of overtime,

34:05.460 --> 34:08.293
and my mom was always sad, mad,

34:08.797 --> 34:11.915
long-suffering
'cause he was never home, and so,

34:12.007 --> 34:14.375
he got sad and mad
and never wanted to be home.

34:15.094 --> 34:19.179
And what teenage Floyd figured out
was that in this business,

34:19.266 --> 34:21.632
you gotta date someone
in the same line of work.

34:22.351 --> 34:23.592
Civilians don't get it.

34:24.563 --> 34:28.022
Or they get it,
but they just can't handle it.

34:29.775 --> 34:33.690
Okay, when I get back,
I'm gonna ask out Kathy.

34:34.281 --> 34:36.273
Okay. If you want to get your ass beat.

34:54.717 --> 34:56.208
My friend!

34:56.303 --> 34:57.293
Welcome.

34:58.555 --> 34:59.966
We have better inside.

35:00.807 --> 35:02.514
You come inside, we drink tea,

35:02.601 --> 35:04.342
and I show.

36:46.162 --> 36:49.451
We are not brothers.

37:11.813 --> 37:13.349
<i>This is the Western Union</i>

37:13.440 --> 37:16.274
<i>at South Las Vegas Boulevard?</i>

37:16.609 --> 37:19.568
I'm calling to check the status
of money sent.

37:19.654 --> 37:21.816
My tracking number is

37:21.906 --> 37:26.992
seven-four-nine-one-
eight-three-seven-zero-five.

37:31.166 --> 37:34.250
Good. Thank you. Have a good day.

37:48.057 --> 37:49.264
What are you doing here?

37:49.976 --> 37:51.217
I missed you.

37:52.270 --> 37:53.681
So, you flew back?

37:54.898 --> 37:56.560
I'm rotated out for the month.

37:57.567 --> 37:58.808
Oh.

38:01.946 --> 38:05.405
I drew a picture of happiness
for you on the plane.

38:14.918 --> 38:16.329
Who did that to you?

38:20.215 --> 38:21.751
You can't tell me.

38:24.677 --> 38:25.667
Can I come in?

38:27.514 --> 38:29.631
Yeah, of course you can come in.
I just...

38:30.391 --> 38:31.381
What?

38:33.353 --> 38:36.972
Ali, this isn't working. I need...

38:37.065 --> 38:39.057
- Don't break up with me.
- I never see you.

38:39.317 --> 38:41.604
You disappear. You reappear.
I can't ask you anything.

38:41.778 --> 38:43.064
- I know.
- I don't know who you are.

38:43.154 --> 38:44.861
- I don't know what you do.
- No, you know who I am.

38:44.989 --> 38:46.730
I don't want to live like this.
This is not what...

38:46.866 --> 38:48.232
You want someone totally predictable?

38:48.368 --> 38:50.701
- No. No, I want...
- I'm predictable.

38:51.579 --> 38:53.616
- I'll always come home to you.
- Ali...

38:53.790 --> 38:55.702
The second the plane lands,

38:56.584 --> 38:57.791
I'll come home to you.

39:00.088 --> 39:04.799
I hate not knowing where you are.
I hate that you might be in danger.

39:05.218 --> 39:08.006
Of course, you hate it.
It's good that you hate it.

39:08.179 --> 39:09.169
Why is it good?

39:09.264 --> 39:11.130
Because it means we're in love.

39:27.907 --> 39:28.897
What?

39:29.617 --> 39:32.860
"When love beckons to you, follow him,

39:33.246 --> 39:35.738
"though his ways are hard and steep."

39:37.584 --> 39:41.168
- Kahlil Gibran.
- Really?

39:42.297 --> 39:44.254
You're gonna quote poetry?

39:45.258 --> 39:48.217
Hi, honey. I'm home.

40:08.448 --> 40:10.815
Open your eyes.

40:20.043 --> 40:22.410
So, this is you?

40:22.587 --> 40:26.046
This is my first bed in America.
In Pennsylvania.

40:27.091 --> 40:30.755
And this is happiness because?

40:32.889 --> 40:35.506
Because maybe after a week,
I realized I never had to

40:35.600 --> 40:37.216
wake up in the middle
of the night again,

40:37.310 --> 40:39.472
and go to the bottom of the stairs.

40:40.063 --> 40:43.522
Why would you go
to the bottom of the stairs?

40:45.443 --> 40:48.356
That's the safest place in a house
when bombs are falling.

40:55.662 --> 40:56.778
I got a tip yesterday.

40:57.163 --> 40:58.904
- Pretty hot tip.
- Yeah?

40:59.207 --> 41:01.620
<i>The New York Times</i>
is gonna publish a story on you.

41:02.502 --> 41:04.038
I think I'd have heard about that.

41:05.672 --> 41:09.291
Basic thrust is that the security
of the country may be compromised

41:09.384 --> 41:12.297
because the Head of Counterterrorism
in New York

41:12.387 --> 41:15.095
was the subject
of intense internal scrutiny,

41:15.181 --> 41:18.515
following the loss of a briefcase
containing classified documents.

41:18.935 --> 41:22.224
- Where'd they get that from?
- I have no idea.

41:22.772 --> 41:25.059
So, kill it.

41:25.149 --> 41:27.106
I can kill it. I...

41:27.193 --> 41:30.607
You don't think I know the editor?
You think I haven't bought him dinner?

41:30.697 --> 41:31.938
You need to resign.

41:36.035 --> 41:37.947
No! No. I'm... Look...

41:38.037 --> 41:41.280
John. John, John, John.
I don't want to fire you.

41:41.582 --> 41:42.572
Good.

41:42.750 --> 41:44.332
So, you need to resign.

41:50.425 --> 41:54.135
I've been here 25 years.

41:54.971 --> 41:56.837
You need to resign today.

42:08.943 --> 42:12.277
Oh, no! We lost your hat.

42:14.782 --> 42:15.772
Thanks.

42:19.746 --> 42:20.827
How old?

42:21.205 --> 42:24.243
She'll be three. We just moved here.

42:24.333 --> 42:25.949
She's never seen the sea before.

42:27.295 --> 42:28.581
You want to get up?

42:29.297 --> 42:31.289
I'm gonna take her in.

42:34.844 --> 42:37.006
Oh, yeah. That's right!

42:38.222 --> 42:40.965
It's the sea. Yeah.

42:45.438 --> 42:47.350
I normally
don't attend the weekly

42:47.440 --> 42:49.978
counterterrorism meeting as a rule,

42:50.234 --> 42:52.100
but I wanted to be here today,
to underscore

42:52.195 --> 42:53.811
that from the CIA's perspective,

42:53.905 --> 42:58.400
there is nothing more urgent
than containing al-Qaeda.

42:58.493 --> 42:59.529
Thank you, George.

43:00.620 --> 43:04.330
I told your colleague the other day,
I don't deal in generalities.

43:04.499 --> 43:05.615
I need specifics.

43:05.875 --> 43:07.992
And specifics you shall have, good lady.

43:08.127 --> 43:10.619
The NSA's been hearing
a lot of chatter from

43:10.713 --> 43:12.921
various terrorist cells.
Correct, Michael?

43:13.216 --> 43:14.252
Roger that.

43:14.634 --> 43:17.968
We're concerned
about a potential attack on

43:18.054 --> 43:19.761
Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Israel...

43:19.847 --> 43:22.681
The word "potential"
is inherently unspecific.

43:22.767 --> 43:25.931
And Genoa, Italy,
for this year's G8 summit.

43:26.312 --> 43:28.679
Hey, George?
Listen, I gotta tell you something.

43:28.815 --> 43:30.772
I gotta tell all of you guys something.

43:31.192 --> 43:34.401
I'm gone. I'm out.

43:34.695 --> 43:35.685
I heard.

43:35.905 --> 43:39.364
So, this is my last meeting.
It's my last one of these.

43:40.076 --> 43:43.820
So, I just want to say
straight up to the Agency guys, okay?

43:44.956 --> 43:46.822
Maybe your people
won't talk to my people

43:46.916 --> 43:49.033
because somebody's got a hard-on for me.

43:49.127 --> 43:52.916
But I'm out of here.
It's not about me anymore.

43:53.005 --> 43:56.544
My people, my guys,
are trying to keep Americans safe.

43:57.844 --> 43:59.130
Forget the fucking Genoese
for a second...

43:59.220 --> 44:02.384
Maybe let Mr. Tenet finish, Mr...

44:04.350 --> 44:07.843
Mr. O'Neill
makes an excellent point.

44:07.937 --> 44:10.395
There are terrorists here.

44:10.523 --> 44:12.731
I explained to you
about the terrorist cells

44:12.817 --> 44:15.480
- and the transnational nature of...
- Who is here?

44:16.404 --> 44:19.988
Is there someone in the United States
that is a clear and present danger,

44:20.074 --> 44:22.157
that I need to be
worrying about right now,

44:22.285 --> 44:25.198
or are you talking about swatting flies?

44:25.288 --> 44:29.874
Because the President has told me
he has no interest in swatting flies.

44:31.711 --> 44:33.998
John's right.
We have had repeated trouble

44:34.088 --> 44:37.923
with the sharing of information
between Alec Station and I-49.

44:38.009 --> 44:41.377
Are you, George, aware of
any information that hasn't been shared?

44:44.891 --> 44:46.974
The President is correct.

44:47.059 --> 44:50.223
We need to have
a comprehensive strategy, which is why

44:50.313 --> 44:52.771
I'm meeting with him on Tuesday
when he gets back from Texas.

44:53.983 --> 44:57.067
Okay. Let's move on.

45:16.297 --> 45:19.631
This is the ladies' room.

45:19.800 --> 45:22.884
Or did you think you could have me, too?

45:27.475 --> 45:29.888
Don't you think
the world would be a better place

45:29.977 --> 45:32.435
if two people
could have an honest conversation

45:32.521 --> 45:34.729
about what's really going on?

45:42.073 --> 45:43.689
I think the world
would be a better place

45:43.783 --> 45:47.197
if old men
didn't hang around the ladies' room.

46:35.251 --> 46:36.537
George Tenet, please.

46:37.878 --> 46:38.959
Thank you.

46:43.467 --> 46:45.254
- Yes.
- George?

46:46.679 --> 46:49.763
