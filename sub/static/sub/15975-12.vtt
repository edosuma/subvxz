-- Good news.
-- What?

01:04:35.808 --> 01:04:38.004
From now on,
I am not Dan.

01:04:38.077 --> 01:04:39.238
I'm not Danny.

01:04:39.312 --> 01:04:40.279
I'm Daniel.

01:04:40.346 --> 01:04:41.575
Good. Let's go.

01:04:41.647 --> 01:04:44.241
When I joined the union, there
already was a Daniel Rydell.

01:04:44.317 --> 01:04:45.785
Come on.
Let's go do the show.

01:04:45.851 --> 01:04:46.750
Guess what happened.

01:04:46.819 --> 01:04:47.684
What, the guy died?

01:04:47.753 --> 01:04:48.743
-- The guy died.
-- Excellent.

01:04:48.821 --> 01:04:50.255
-- I'm Daniel.
-- Nice to meet you.

-- Hang on.

01:04:51.591 --> 01:04:53.650
We're going to call you back
first thing in the morning.

01:04:53.726 --> 01:04:55.387
-- Jeremy...
-- Listen to this.

01:04:55.461 --> 01:04:56.360
I'm Daniel now.

01:04:56.429 --> 01:04:57.157
Can we go?

01:04:57.230 --> 01:04:58.629
That was a woman whose name

01:04:58.698 --> 01:04:59.824
I can't remember now.

01:04:59.899 --> 01:05:01.094
-- Was it Daniel?
-- No.

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:03.862
-- Good. -- She's a publicist
at a cosmetics company,

01:05:03.936 --> 01:05:05.335
and do we want five minutes

01:05:05.404 --> 01:05:07.372
on the air this Thursday
with M.J.?

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.101
-- Jordan wants to do an interview?
-- Yeah.

01:05:09.175 --> 01:05:10.574
-- Yeah.
-- Here?

01:05:10.643 --> 01:05:13.203
-- VVell, why was it a publicist from
a cosmetics company? -- Because...

01:05:13.279 --> 01:05:14.542
-- Ah, don't tell me.
-- Yeah.

01:05:14.614 --> 01:05:15.843
-- He's got a cologne coming out.
-- Yeah.

01:05:15.915 --> 01:05:18.213
Michael Jordan
has a second cologne?

01:05:18.284 --> 01:05:19.752
It's called Jordan.

01:05:19.819 --> 01:05:20.911
Interesting.

01:05:20.987 --> 01:05:22.978
How do you suppose
he thought up the name?

01:05:23.055 --> 01:05:24.989
-- Who cares? They called us.
-- They did.

01:05:25.057 --> 01:05:26.957
-- You gotta be happy about that.
-- I am.

01:05:27.026 --> 01:05:29.518
They could've called Fox,
they could've called ESPN --

01:05:29.595 --> 01:05:30.790
-- They called us.
-- Right.

01:05:30.863 --> 01:05:32.092
Oh, let's go do the show.

01:05:32.164 --> 01:05:33.757
I think you should
get happy.

01:05:33.833 --> 01:05:35.597
-- I am happy.
-- You don't look happy.

01:05:35.668 --> 01:05:37.659
I'm happy, I just have
other concerns.

01:05:37.737 --> 01:05:39.865
Natalie, what do you think
of Daniel Rydell?

01:05:39.939 --> 01:05:42.670
-- Are you referring to yourself
in the third person? -- No.

01:05:42.742 --> 01:05:45.006
-- 'Cause it's awfully annoying.
-- I know it is.

01:05:45.077 --> 01:05:48.342
Also when they change the pronunciation
of their name in midstream.

01:05:48.414 --> 01:05:50.940
"Don't call me Tony 'Dorsitt.'
call me Tony Dor-sett."

01:05:51.017 --> 01:05:52.075
No, this is --

01:05:52.151 --> 01:05:54.381
And like getting the world
to call Prince

01:05:54.453 --> 01:05:57.320
by one pretentious name
in a lifetime wasn't enough,

01:05:57.390 --> 01:05:59.859
I gotta learn to draw
the symbol for boron.

01:05:59.925 --> 01:06:01.950
-- No, this is --
-- What's on your mind?

01:06:02.028 --> 01:06:03.792
-- Nothing.
-- Four minutes to air.

01:06:03.863 --> 01:06:05.558
This is turning out
to be a good day.

01:06:05.631 --> 01:06:06.621
That's right.

01:06:06.699 --> 01:06:08.394
We landed an interview
with M.J.

01:06:08.467 --> 01:06:10.401
Yes, and Sam Donovan
gets in tonight.

01:06:10.469 --> 01:06:13.336
-- You've taken a liking to him,
haven't you? -- Sam Donovan?

01:06:13.406 --> 01:06:14.498
-- Yeah.
-- Yes, I have.

01:06:14.573 --> 01:06:16.132
Because he drives
Dana crazy?

01:06:16.208 --> 01:06:18.506
Ah, there are many reasons
why I like the man.

01:06:18.577 --> 01:06:19.669
But mostly because...

01:06:19.745 --> 01:06:21.144
He drives Dana crazy.

01:06:21.213 --> 01:06:23.978
-- So what are your concerns?
-- What concerns?

01:06:24.050 --> 01:06:25.984
You said before that you were
happy, but you had some concerns.

01:06:26.052 --> 01:06:29.181
Uh, I have to go to Charlie's class
tomorrow and do a presentation.

01:06:29.255 --> 01:06:30.586
-- Of what?
-- Anything.

01:06:30.656 --> 01:06:31.919
I have to
demonstrate something.

01:06:31.991 --> 01:06:33.891
-- You know what you're going to do?
-- No.

01:06:33.959 --> 01:06:35.984
And please don't tell me it doesn't
matter what I do, that I'm his father,

01:06:36.062 --> 01:06:37.461
and that he'll be impressed
with me no matter what.

01:06:37.530 --> 01:06:39.862
He's 10, Casey. He's gonna be
mortified by you no matter what.

01:06:39.932 --> 01:06:41.195
Thanks for the pep talk,
Danny.

01:06:41.267 --> 01:06:42.564

I wonder what it's like.

01:06:54.046 --> 01:06:55.536
The publicist faxed me
the press kit,

01:06:55.614 --> 01:06:57.013
and apparently
the new fragrance,

01:06:57.083 --> 01:06:58.573

Michael himself,

01:06:58.651 --> 01:07:02.087

-- He is.

01:07:20.806 --> 01:07:22.797
You're letting him

I'm not <i>letting</i> him

01:07:24.810 --> 01:07:27.643
I haven't given him permission or anything.
He does it all by himself.

--Isthatsupposed to make
me feel better? -- Yeah.

01:07:31.951 --> 01:07:35.148
He breezes on in from whatever
city he's just breezed out of,

01:07:35.221 --> 01:07:37.280
and then he, you know,
breezes on in,

01:07:37.356 --> 01:07:39.051
always right before the show,

01:07:39.125 --> 01:07:41.787
when he always tweaks
the top of the rundown.

01:07:41.861 --> 01:07:43.090
He's kind of got you
psyched out.

01:07:43.162 --> 01:07:44.891
He does not
have me psyched out.

scramble around.

01:08:14.727 --> 01:08:16.091

-- What?
<i>Jeremy: She's right.</i>

01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:49.341
Are you reading this?

01:10:49.415 --> 01:10:51.315
-- The last page? This was
not meant for us. -- Yeah.

01:10:51.383 --> 01:10:54.216
-- What are you two talking about?
-- The last page in the press kit.

01:10:54.286 --> 01:10:56.755
It's not meant for us. It's not meant for
the press. It got in here by accident.

01:10:56.822 --> 01:10:59.757
It was written by a publicist
for Michael's people.

01:10:59.825 --> 01:11:01.987
"We must be cautious or the
media will spin the interview

Yes.

01:11:16.141 --> 01:11:17.233

<i>We're interviewers, Dana.

01:11:36.362 --> 01:11:38.626
Do you think we're gonna get
outfoxed by Michael Jordan?

01:11:38.697 --> 01:11:41.758
Of course you're gonna get outfoxed by
Michael Jordan. He's Michael Jordan.

01:11:41.834 --> 01:11:45.202
We have media skills
we can utilize, right?

01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:46.465
Sure.

01:11:46.538 --> 01:11:48.006
Really?

We'll bring him back
to basketball.

"...your sensuality, your love
of literature and the arts."

01:11:56.148 --> 01:11:59.812
Forget basketball. Let him talk about
sensuality and books he's read.

01:11:59.885 --> 01:12:01.284
It's worth
21/2 share points.

01:12:01.353 --> 01:12:03.845
Well, tallyho, Sam.
I didn't know you were with us.

-- Thanks. We <i>don't</i> need you.

-- Yeah.

-- Yeah.

-- Yeah. Don't you?

Yes.

Hang on.
Can I just say something?

01:12:26.245 --> 01:12:28.373
I have to go
to Charlie's class tomorrow

01:12:28.447 --> 01:12:30.245
and do some sort
of presentation,

01:12:30.315 --> 01:12:34.013
and it turns out I really have
no demonstrable skills.

01:12:34.086 --> 01:12:36.020
Any of you have an idea?

01:12:36.088 --> 01:12:38.079
Well, your head's
a perfect rectangle.

01:12:42.428 --> 01:12:45.125
I'll be in my office
if you come up with anything.

This is fantastic.

to fly on sunlight.

01:13:08.687 --> 01:13:10.655
So, we got
this Michael Jordan offer --

01:13:10.723 --> 01:13:13.215
<i>For farther out, where
the sunlight grows weaker,</i>

01:13:13.292 --> 01:13:15.784

01:13:18.030 --> 01:13:21.000
Yes, swimming not in water,

from Jovian moons

Uh, Michael Jordan --

"Their utility could be
comparable to that

to talk about cologne.

01:13:47.159 --> 01:13:48.285
In the press kit,

01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:51.386
they accidentally included
coaching notes for Michael

01:13:51.463 --> 01:13:54.330
on how to bring the interview
back to the cologne.

01:13:54.399 --> 01:13:55.730
-- Heh!
-- Yeah.

01:13:55.801 --> 01:13:57.565
Do we book the interview?

01:13:57.636 --> 01:13:58.467
Absolutely.

-- <i>Isaac...</i>
-- <i>Absolutely.</i>

01:14:00.539 --> 01:14:02.337

-- There's no difference.
-- Michael's Michael.

01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:06.800
Let him talk
about what he wants.

01:14:06.879 --> 01:14:09.814
You really want to use “Sports
Night“ for a 5-minute infomercial?

01:14:09.882 --> 01:14:11.475

S-year-olds are buying
after-shave, Isaac.

01:14:18.791 --> 01:14:20.520
I'm not sure
it's a huge step forward.

01:14:20.592 --> 01:14:22.424
I'll take
any step forward.

01:14:22.494 --> 01:14:24.155
Okay.

<i>They're talking about
bioengineering animals</i>

<i>and terraforming Mars.</i>

about this?

01:14:42.948 --> 01:14:44.211
Yes.

01:14:44.283 --> 01:14:45.682
<i>Why?</i>

01:14:45.751 --> 01:14:48.516
Because I won't
be alive to see it.

01:14:48.587 --> 01:14:51.215
Okay.

01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:58.921

01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:16.443
here I go.

01:15:16.515 --> 01:15:17.880
What do you got?

01:15:17.950 --> 01:15:20.044
Uh, I came up with several
interesting things

01:15:20.118 --> 01:15:23.349
-- I think will, you know, captivate
their young minds. -- What do you got?

01:15:23.422 --> 01:15:25.948
It's not one particular thing
so much as an overview --

01:15:26.024 --> 01:15:27.389
Casey, what do you got?

01:15:30.128 --> 01:15:33.120

-- Who?
-- Sally.

01:15:38.403 --> 01:15:39.564
I'll see you later.

01:15:44.109 --> 01:15:45.702
What did you say?

01:15:45.777 --> 01:15:47.609
Sally looks good today.

01:15:47.679 --> 01:15:49.443
-- Why <i>did you say that?</i>
-- <i>'Cause she does.</i>

01:15:49.514 --> 01:15:50.606
-- You don't like Sally.
-- <i>I kind</i> of do.

01:15:50.682 --> 01:15:52.377
-- You can't.
-- Why not?

01:15:52.451 --> 01:15:54.681
'Cause my life is very confusing right now.
So is yours. And you can't like Sally.

01:15:54.753 --> 01:15:57.154
I didn't say I liked Sally.
I said she looked good today.

01:15:57.222 --> 01:15:58.451
Then you said
you liked her.

01:15:58.523 --> 01:16:00.321
Beowulf wasn't a movie?

01:16:00.392 --> 01:16:03.657
You know, I have to go and
pretend to bake bread now.

01:16:03.729 --> 01:16:06.994

-- You've been doing an impressive

01:16:28.687 --> 01:16:30.553
-- Ratings are up two-tenths.
-- Yes.

01:16:30.622 --> 01:16:32.420
I don't know
what you've heard about me,

01:16:32.491 --> 01:16:34.255
but I'm here
to set the record straight

01:16:34.326 --> 01:16:36.226
and have the opportunity
for a fresh start.

01:16:36.295 --> 01:16:38.024
I haven't heard
anything about you.

01:16:38.096 --> 01:16:39.586
-- Sure you have.
-- No, I haven't.

01:16:39.665 --> 01:16:42.134
-- I was the one sleeping with Gordon.
-- Who's Gordon?

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:44.862
-- Dana's fiancé. -- I didn't
know that Dana was engaged.

01:16:44.937 --> 01:16:47.804
-- She's not anymore. -- 'Cause you
were sleeping with her fiance?

01:16:47.873 --> 01:16:50.274
Yes, but really it was because
I was sleeping with Casey,

01:16:50.342 --> 01:16:53.403
and Gordon knew that she was more
upset that I was sleeping with Casey

01:16:53.478 --> 01:16:56.140
than she was that I was
sleeping with Gordon.

01:16:56.214 --> 01:16:57.147
Okay.

01:16:57.215 --> 01:16:59.343
Were you able
to follow all that?

01:16:59.418 --> 01:17:01.386
No, but that's just because
I wasn't paying attention.

01:17:01.453 --> 01:17:04.252
Anyway, I wasn't sure
what you'd heard.

01:17:04.323 --> 01:17:05.791
I hadn't heard anything.

01:17:05.857 --> 01:17:08.224

up the ladder,

That is --
in a million years,

01:20:25.390 --> 01:20:28.121
would Fox or ESPN
give editorial approval?

01:20:28.193 --> 01:20:30.161
No.

01:20:30.228 --> 01:20:32.595
That's why
they came to us.

01:20:32.664 --> 01:20:34.632
Yeah.

Okay.

You don't care, do you?

01:20:42.607 --> 01:20:45.406

how bogus the ill-gotten gains.

What are you
talking about?

01:21:44.069 --> 01:21:45.366
It's a condition
of the interview.

01:21:45.437 --> 01:21:46.734
This is a news show.

01:21:46.805 --> 01:21:48.739
We don't give
editorial approval.

01:21:48.807 --> 01:21:49.933
That's right.

01:21:51.243 --> 01:21:53.507
-- They're insisting?
-- Yeah.

01:21:53.578 --> 01:21:55.512
Well, Dana, if we did it
just this once --

-- Isaac.

-- We <i>can't...</i>

They didn't go to Fox,
and they didn't go to ESPN.

01:22:01.586 --> 01:22:05.784
Because they thought we were desperate
enough for the ratings to do it?

01:22:05.857 --> 01:22:07.086
Yeah.

01:22:07.158 --> 01:22:09.957

Whatever
I was in the mood for.

01:22:56.908 --> 01:22:59.002

-- I didn't do the bread.
-- What'd you do?

01:23:12.757 --> 01:23:14.156
I did what I do, Dan.

01:23:14.225 --> 01:23:15.693
I did what I do.

01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:18.229
You screwed up your romantic
life in front of fifth graders?

01:23:18.296 --> 01:23:19.388
-- [Laughter]
-- No.

01:23:19.464 --> 01:23:20.829
I got there early,

01:23:20.899 --> 01:23:23.800
and I'm standing out on the
playground during recess,

01:23:23.868 --> 01:23:25.802
and I'm trying to think what I can
come up with at the last minute,

01:23:25.870 --> 01:23:29.500
but I can't concentrate on that because
all around me kids are playing games.

01:23:29.574 --> 01:23:31.008
There's some kickball
going on over there,

like a surge,

I'm suddenly filled
with this sense of,

01:23:37.916 --> 01:23:39.850
"I know what the hell
I'm doing."

01:23:39.918 --> 01:23:41.079
And when recess was over,

01:23:41.152 --> 01:23:43.052
we go back
into the classroom...

01:23:43.121 --> 01:23:45.215
And you called
the highlights.

01:23:45.290 --> 01:23:48.123
I called the highlights.
It was fantastic.

01:23:48.193 --> 01:23:50.218
<i>I did interviews with the

01:23:50.295 --> 01:23:52.787

01:23:54.599 --> 01:23:56.897

gonna say something stupid,

but when I got her
talking about foursies,

01:23:59.971 --> 01:24:01.735
she was like Muhammad Ali.

01:24:09.647 --> 01:24:11.877
It's not going to happen.
Let's get back to work.

01:24:16.121 --> 01:24:17.748
Too many strings, huh?

01:24:17.822 --> 01:24:18.789
Yeah.

01:24:18.857 --> 01:24:21.656
-- Was it tough on Isaac?
-- Yeah.

01:24:21.726 --> 01:24:22.784
Is Sam pissed?

01:24:22.861 --> 01:24:24.124
No. He --

01:24:24.195 --> 01:24:25.788
Turns out he was on my side
on this one.

01:24:25.864 --> 01:24:26.797
Cool.

01:24:26.865 --> 01:24:28.333

Totally...crazy.

01:24:32.137 --> 01:24:35.596
<i>Anyway, uh, I will be
back in my office.</i>

01:24:35.673 --> 01:24:36.697
Okay.

01:24:36.775 --> 01:24:37.901
See ya.

01:24:37.976 --> 01:24:39.842

-- So...
-- Yes?

01:24:41.312 --> 01:24:44.043
-- You had a good day.
-- Yes, yes.

01:24:44.115 --> 01:24:46.709
But as the adrenaline of the
afternoon begins to drain away,

01:24:46.785 --> 01:24:48.844
some other things begin
to come into focus.

01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:49.819
Like what?

01:24:49.888 --> 01:24:51.481
Well, I finally broke up
with Dana,

01:24:51.556 --> 01:24:53.285
who I
never went out with.

01:24:53.358 --> 01:24:56.919
Dana broke up with Gordon
because Sally slept with me,

01:24:56.995 --> 01:24:58.929
and you said
you like Sally.

01:24:58.997 --> 01:25:00.328
Hmm.

01:25:00.398 --> 01:25:04.164
And maybe Sam drives Dana
a little too crazy?

01:25:04.235 --> 01:25:05.999
Yeah.

01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:07.834
I have some concerns.

01:25:07.906 --> 01:25:10.341
Well, it wouldn't be a day
unless you had some concerns.

01:25:10.408 --> 01:25:11.375
Yeah, I suppose.

01:25:11.443 --> 01:25:13.935
