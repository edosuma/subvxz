WEBVTT

00:09.009 --> 00:12.113
( explosion )

00:16.417 --> 00:18.286
Here's an idea.

00:18.319 --> 00:20.554
Why don't we swing north,
play a few hands in Vegas?

00:20.588 --> 00:22.556
Sure, and you
can explain why

00:22.590 --> 00:24.325
we're 300 miles
off the approved route.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.560
You guys can catch up
in the follow car.

00:26.594 --> 00:27.561
There's a big climb ahead.

00:27.595 --> 00:28.762
Probably right.

00:28.796 --> 00:30.464
We'll see you at
the top of the hill.

00:48.282 --> 00:50.318
Ray leave already?

00:50.351 --> 00:53.121
Figured he could use
a head start.

00:53.154 --> 00:55.756
( engine cranks, sputters )

01:03.364 --> 01:06.200
Nice. Just what we needed.

01:09.170 --> 01:12.273
Hey, Ray.

01:12.306 --> 01:15.276
Ray, we're having car trouble.
You may have to hold up.

01:18.279 --> 01:20.281
Ray, this is Chris.
Give me a shout back.

01:20.314 --> 01:22.150
( static over radio )

01:22.183 --> 01:24.385
( knocks on glass )
I'm not getting an answer.

01:27.488 --> 01:30.291
Ray, come on, man, talk to us.

01:30.324 --> 01:31.859
( static over radio )

01:31.892 --> 01:33.694
Everything all right?

01:37.665 --> 01:40.234
Ray, answer me.

01:41.369 --> 01:43.337
( sirens blaring )

01:50.844 --> 01:52.246
We're on scene now.

01:52.280 --> 01:53.747
- Profiling, yeah.
- Not yet.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.749
Hey.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.218
Who's got a handle on this?

01:57.251 --> 01:58.586
All right, I'll
talk to you later.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.354
Hey, Don Eppes, FBI.

02:00.388 --> 02:01.222
- Hi.
- Agent Sinclair.

02:01.255 --> 02:03.224
Brent Hauser,
Department of Energy.

02:03.257 --> 02:04.758
Where are the two other drivers?

02:04.792 --> 02:05.893
Three of them
rotate each shift.

02:05.926 --> 02:08.629
When they tried the follow car,
it wouldn't start up.

02:08.662 --> 02:10.264
How long has the rig
been missing?

02:10.298 --> 02:11.332
Four hours.

02:11.365 --> 02:12.300
Four hours?

02:12.333 --> 02:13.934
Any reason we weren't notified
right away?

02:13.967 --> 02:15.503
Transportation of nuclear waste

02:15.536 --> 02:17.471
is under the supervision
of the Department of Energy.

02:17.505 --> 02:18.606
Not when it's stolen, it isn't.

02:18.639 --> 02:19.740
I would rather we not jump

02:19.773 --> 02:20.974
to any conclusions, Agent Eppes.

02:21.008 --> 02:23.677
Has there been any notice to
the public, any city agencies?

02:23.711 --> 02:25.279
That would only cause
a public panic.

02:25.313 --> 02:26.847
I'd rather wait
until we have more information,

02:26.880 --> 02:29.283
find out where the truck is,
and then, if necessary,

02:29.317 --> 02:31.485
we can implement a more focused
public safety plan.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.887
Mr. Hauser, I got New Mexico on
the phone for you.

02:33.921 --> 02:36.357
Isolation plant in Carlsbad.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.558
Where the cargo
was headed.

02:37.591 --> 02:38.626
Excuse me.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.794
The guy doesn't want to tell
four million people

02:40.828 --> 02:43.464
in Los Angeles that he's lost a
truckload of radioactive waste.

02:43.497 --> 02:46.367
He wants to bet he's going to
find it so he can be the hero.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.402
If he doesn't, we've got
a big problem on our hands.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.206
The nuclear material
entered the area here,

02:52.240 --> 02:53.307
from its origin point

02:53.341 --> 02:55.776
in Ridgeland, en route
to an in-ground burial site

02:55.809 --> 02:57.245
in New Mexico.

02:57.278 --> 02:58.579
D.O.E. set up a perimeter,
but not

02:58.612 --> 03:00.548
until 40 minutes after the truck
disappeared.

03:00.581 --> 03:01.749
I mean, it could be anywhere.

03:01.782 --> 03:04.252
TERRY: Highway Patrol's thinking
it's got to be relatively

03:04.285 --> 03:06.454
local, given the roadblocks
they did get a chance to set up.

03:06.487 --> 03:07.555
DAVID:
What about the chance

03:07.588 --> 03:08.289
the shipment's already been
removed from the truck?

03:08.322 --> 03:10.224
HAUSER:
We're fairly confident

03:10.258 --> 03:11.425
that that hasn't happened yet.

03:11.459 --> 03:13.461
You're "fairly confident"?

03:13.494 --> 03:15.463
Removing the materials would
cause a sizable radiation leak.

03:15.496 --> 03:17.398
We have several airborne sensors
up over the area.

03:17.431 --> 03:18.566
So far,

03:18.599 --> 03:19.700
they're all negative.

03:19.733 --> 03:20.901
So this stuff is only dangerous

03:20.934 --> 03:22.936
if someone tries to take it out
of one of the containers?

03:22.970 --> 03:24.438
Look,

03:24.472 --> 03:25.539
my team has a right
to know

03:25.573 --> 03:26.607
what we're dealing
with here.

03:26.640 --> 03:29.610
The holding casks the
materials are shipped in--

03:29.643 --> 03:31.679
they don't offer
100% containment.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.013
TERRY:
You're saying

03:33.046 --> 03:34.282
the casks leak?

03:34.315 --> 03:35.783
Only at NRC-approved
levels.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.651
DON: All right, so left alone,
they are

03:37.685 --> 03:38.886
a hazard
to anyone near it.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.988
It's a matter
of practicality.

03:41.021 --> 03:44.492
A leak-proof container would be
too heavy to transport.

03:44.525 --> 03:46.560
Let's just assume whoever
stole it has bigger plans.

03:46.594 --> 03:47.461
What could they do with it?

03:47.495 --> 03:48.796
Worst case scenario?

03:49.930 --> 03:51.399
A dirty bomb.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.572
We all use math every day...

03:58.606 --> 04:00.441
to predict weather...

04:00.474 --> 04:03.477
to tell time...

04:03.511 --> 04:06.814
to handle money...

04:06.847 --> 04:10.784
Math is more than formulas and
equations.

04:10.818 --> 04:13.587
It's logic.

04:13.621 --> 04:15.689
It's rationality.

04:15.723 --> 04:20.027
It's using your mind to solve
the biggest mysteries we know.

04:27.968 --> 04:31.439
...ultimately, yielding
a Gravadan zero model

04:31.472 --> 04:32.706
of "MQed" over "K".

04:32.740 --> 04:36.844
Which happens to be
precisely the range

04:36.877 --> 04:37.878
I predicted.

04:37.911 --> 04:40.814
Charles,
I am indebted to you.

04:40.848 --> 04:42.783
Wait.

04:42.816 --> 04:45.319
Whoa...

04:45.353 --> 04:47.755
- Whoa, whoa, ho, ho.
- Whoa! Ho!

04:47.788 --> 04:48.822
What?

04:48.856 --> 04:49.790
T-t-t-t-t-t...

04:49.823 --> 04:51.625
Don't say "T-t-t-t-t-t."

04:51.659 --> 04:53.694
CHARLIE:
Oh, hold on,

04:53.727 --> 04:54.428
hold... hold on!

04:54.462 --> 04:56.330
Why are you saying
"Hold on"?

04:56.364 --> 04:57.898
What the hell
was I thinking? 'Cause...

04:57.931 --> 04:59.333
What is it?

04:59.367 --> 05:00.033
This-this entire line

05:00.067 --> 05:02.336
is-is, uh, unfounded.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.738
- It's-it's unusable
( screaming )

05:04.772 --> 05:05.873
Tell me you're joking here.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.475
I am. I'm kidding around

05:07.508 --> 05:10.744
Why are you doing this
to me?

05:10.778 --> 05:12.546
- Well, because...
- Do you not know

05:12.580 --> 05:13.647
how important
this presentation is?

05:13.681 --> 05:15.082
It's fine.

05:15.115 --> 05:16.016
Our last opportunity

05:16.049 --> 05:18.352
for peer review before Atlanta
and you do

05:18.386 --> 05:19.353
"T-t-t-t-t."

05:19.387 --> 05:21.054
- Don't do that.
- I'm sorry.

05:21.088 --> 05:22.890
- No, stop say...
- You know, you fall for that

05:22.923 --> 05:24.091
every time at this point.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.192
- Then don't do it...
- Because...

05:25.225 --> 05:27.895
Excuse me for barging in here.
I gotta talk to you.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.863
All right, well,
I'll let you...

05:29.897 --> 05:31.399
Actually, you being a physicist,

05:31.432 --> 05:32.466
I wouldn't mind if you
stuck around.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.767
What can either of you

05:33.801 --> 05:35.736
tell me about cesium-137?

05:35.769 --> 05:37.438
- Cesium...
- Yeah.

05:37.471 --> 05:38.806
Well, it's a by-product

05:38.839 --> 05:40.941
of the fission
of plutonium and uranium.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.109
It has a half-life

05:42.142 --> 05:44.011
of 30.2 years.

05:44.044 --> 05:46.013
Half-life... that's how long
it stays dangerous?

05:46.046 --> 05:48.416
How we measure
radioactive decay.

05:48.449 --> 05:49.550
What's going on?

05:49.583 --> 05:51.018
What you hear stays
in this room.

05:51.051 --> 05:51.985
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.554
A truck carrying three casks
of this stuff

05:53.587 --> 05:54.555
was hijacked this morning.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.490
Oh, that's not optimal.

05:56.524 --> 05:57.758
You weren't
exposed, right?

05:57.791 --> 05:59.727
No, as far as we know,
no one has yet.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.128
- That's encouraging.
- But what I

06:01.161 --> 06:02.563
would like to know is
specifically

06:02.596 --> 06:03.597
what happens if anyone is.

06:03.631 --> 06:05.499
Well, the danger comes

06:05.533 --> 06:08.769
from something
called ionizing radiation.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.137
You see,
any energy source

06:10.170 --> 06:12.773
gives off some radiation.

06:12.806 --> 06:13.674
CHARLIE:
Cell phones,

06:13.707 --> 06:15.709
computer screens,
even a light bulb...

06:15.743 --> 06:16.777
LARRY: That's right, but
ionizing radiation

06:16.810 --> 06:20.681
is particularly damaging
because it has the energy

06:20.714 --> 06:23.817
to literally knock an electron
off an atom.

06:23.851 --> 06:25.653
For instance,
normally

06:25.686 --> 06:26.887
an electron is locked
in orbit

06:26.920 --> 06:28.021
around an atom.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.557
It's sort of spinning

06:29.590 --> 06:30.658
round and round

06:30.691 --> 06:31.792
like-like this, okay?

06:31.825 --> 06:32.926
But when an atom is exposed

06:32.960 --> 06:36.163
to high levels of ionizing
radiation like gamma rays,

06:36.196 --> 06:39.633
the energy can cause
an electron to break free.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.935
Once that electron
is knocked free,

06:41.969 --> 06:43.837
the atoms can't combine
with other atoms

06:43.871 --> 06:45.138
the way the normally would,

06:45.172 --> 06:46.406
which becomes a real problem

06:46.440 --> 06:48.909
when those collisions occur
inside the human body.

06:48.942 --> 06:54.515
An atom without an electron
won't form the right molecules.

06:54.548 --> 06:58.919
Cell function is disrupted,
DNA chains get broken,

06:58.952 --> 07:00.087
mutated...

07:00.120 --> 07:00.788
So, it's cancer?

07:00.821 --> 07:01.822
CHARLIE:
Cancer, leukemia...

07:01.855 --> 07:03.056
any number of diseases

07:03.090 --> 07:04.592
or immune deficiencies.

07:04.625 --> 07:05.859
LARRY:
May I ask

07:05.893 --> 07:07.761
if those in possession
have made it known

07:07.795 --> 07:09.930
what they intend to do
with this material?

07:09.963 --> 07:11.131
Well, nothing good.

07:11.164 --> 07:12.299
I can promise you that.

07:12.332 --> 07:14.835
From the information we're
getting, it's a dirty bomb.

07:17.237 --> 07:20.508
LARRY:
Well... dirty bomb phraseology

07:20.541 --> 07:23.143
is really a misnomer.

07:23.176 --> 07:25.613
We're talking
radiological dispersion.

07:25.646 --> 07:26.814
Right.

07:26.847 --> 07:27.948
Over how large an area?

07:27.981 --> 07:32.686
It depends on, really, the power
of the explosive used.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.222
So let's say a medium-sized
explosive, like,

07:35.255 --> 07:37.758
uh, 15 or 20
kilograms of...

07:37.791 --> 07:39.727
of TNT...

07:39.760 --> 07:42.696
The amount of radioactive
material in the casks...

07:42.730 --> 07:43.697
You said there were three?

07:43.731 --> 07:44.732
That's right.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.033
Uh...

07:46.066 --> 07:51.204
So, we're talking 500 grams
of cesium-137...

07:51.238 --> 07:53.907
LARRY: Don't forget the wind
variables

07:53.941 --> 07:55.275
and rain
and specific topography...

07:55.308 --> 07:56.610
DON:
Try no rain

07:56.644 --> 07:58.979
and put the bomb
in the city somewhere.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.848
No rain, huh?
Okay. Um...

08:10.991 --> 08:13.927
The dispersal area's
going to be about

08:13.961 --> 08:15.896
26,000 square meters.

08:15.929 --> 08:17.197
DON:
That's like a tenth of a mile

08:17.230 --> 08:18.732
on each side, right?

08:18.766 --> 08:20.534
A city block.

08:20.568 --> 08:22.636
Bigger bomb, maybe two blocks.

08:24.972 --> 08:27.240
Tell us about the route
you took.

08:27.274 --> 08:28.241
It's a straight shot

08:28.275 --> 08:29.743
to Carlsbad.

08:29.777 --> 08:30.978
And who decides the route?

08:31.011 --> 08:31.912
It comes from the company.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.847
The head of transportation
makes the call

08:33.881 --> 08:34.882
based on weather,
traffic.

08:34.915 --> 08:36.283
DRIVER TWO:
They try to avoid

08:36.316 --> 08:38.218
high population areas,
stuff like that.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.820
So the head of transportation
knows.

08:39.853 --> 08:40.854
Who else?

08:40.888 --> 08:42.055
No one.

08:42.089 --> 08:45.859
Route's kept secret until about
two hours before we leave.

08:45.893 --> 08:48.762
The thing is it's not like the
truck's camouflaged or anything.

08:48.796 --> 08:50.631
It's got radiation warnings
all over it.

08:50.664 --> 08:51.565
But prior to going
to breakfast,

08:51.599 --> 08:53.000
you weren't aware
of anyone following you?

08:53.033 --> 08:54.001
DRIVER ONE:
No,

08:54.034 --> 08:55.035
and that's part of my job:

08:55.068 --> 08:56.103
to watch the mirrors.

08:56.136 --> 08:58.005
Radio in if I see something.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.807
What about the missing driver?

08:59.840 --> 09:00.774
Who? Ray?

09:00.808 --> 09:01.675
Yeah. How well do

09:01.709 --> 09:02.475
either one of you know him?

09:02.509 --> 09:05.212
We've done
a few hauls together.

09:05.245 --> 09:06.747
Whose choice was it to stop
at that diner?

09:06.780 --> 09:09.182
His, but I mean,
that's not really odd.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.051
I mean, we all take turns
picking.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.052
Is there any way
he could have had access

09:12.085 --> 09:13.921
to the follow car
while you two were eating?

09:13.954 --> 09:17.190
You think Ray was
involved in this?

09:17.224 --> 09:18.258
Someone disabled the car.

09:18.291 --> 09:19.860
We'd like to know
if Raymond Sites

09:19.893 --> 09:20.961
had the opportunity
to do that.

09:20.994 --> 09:24.031
He went outside
to smoke a cigarette,

09:24.064 --> 09:25.899
but it was only for a minute.

09:29.937 --> 09:32.005
TERRY:
Hey, Don...

09:32.039 --> 09:33.240
- Hey.
- What'd Charlie say?

09:33.273 --> 09:35.809
- We'd better find that truck.
- I think I've got something

09:35.843 --> 09:37.010
- on the missing driver.
- Yeah?

09:37.044 --> 09:38.078
Before his current job,
about a year ago

09:38.111 --> 09:40.047
Raymond Sites worked for
another trucking company.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.982
Got fired for a substance
abuse problem.

09:42.015 --> 09:43.651
I see... meth.

09:43.684 --> 09:46.219
Yeah, he used it to stay awake
during the long hauls.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.255
I don't understand--
how could D.O.E. miss this?

09:48.288 --> 09:49.122
For his termination,

09:49.156 --> 09:51.224
they agreed not to put
the information

09:51.258 --> 09:52.159
in his
employee file.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.862
Take a look at his
bank account records.

09:56.997 --> 09:59.132
TERRY:
Thank you for coming down,

09:59.166 --> 10:00.000
Mrs. Sites.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.169
Yeah, well, those agents
really didn't

10:02.202 --> 10:03.637
give me much
of a choice.

10:03.671 --> 10:05.072
Have you heard
from your husband today?

10:05.105 --> 10:06.073
- Ray?
- Mm-hmm.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.641
No, he's on a haul.

10:07.675 --> 10:08.275
Why do you want

10:08.308 --> 10:09.309
to know about Ray?

10:09.342 --> 10:09.943
TERRY:
Your husband's truck

10:09.977 --> 10:11.845
disappeared this morning.

10:11.879 --> 10:13.380
What do you mean, "Disappeared"?
Where's Ray?

10:13.413 --> 10:14.948
Well, that's what
we'd like to know.

10:14.982 --> 10:17.117
Well, is something being done
to find him?

10:17.150 --> 10:18.285
TERRY: We think your husband's
truck

10:18.318 --> 10:20.788
was hijacked to get
to the cargo.

10:24.124 --> 10:28.195
I always worry about him,
hauling what he does.

10:28.228 --> 10:29.697
The radiation terrifies me.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.665
But I never imagined something
like this.

10:31.699 --> 10:32.866
We also think

10:32.900 --> 10:35.002
he might be involved
in all this.

10:35.035 --> 10:37.004
No, that's not possible.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.138
Not Ray.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.140
We're aware of the problem he
had at his previous job.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.075
TERRY: We're also aware that he
made a deposit

10:42.109 --> 10:43.811
with a cashier's check
for $25,000

10:43.844 --> 10:45.078
into your joint account.

10:45.112 --> 10:46.146
That money didn't come
from his employer.

10:46.179 --> 10:49.717
He was driving day and night.

10:49.750 --> 10:53.921
He just... needed something
to keep himself awake.

10:53.954 --> 10:58.458
And then when he had a problem,
they just let him go.

10:58.491 --> 11:01.094
You don't understand the
strain we were under,

11:01.128 --> 11:02.930
Ray being unemployed
for so long.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.698
Mrs. Sites, if your husband
is involved in this

11:04.732 --> 11:05.498
and people get killed...

11:05.532 --> 11:07.300
No. It's not like that.
It's not.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.236
They lied.

11:09.269 --> 11:11.004
Who lied?

11:11.038 --> 11:13.106
Ray was approached
by some men.

11:13.140 --> 11:14.307
When was this?

11:14.341 --> 11:16.944
Hmm... maybe six weeks ago.

11:16.977 --> 11:18.078
They said they were
with a group

11:18.111 --> 11:19.713
trying to stop
nuclear waste

11:19.747 --> 11:21.148
being hauled
on the highways.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.283
Said they wanted to stage a
protest, you know?

11:23.316 --> 11:24.718
Peaceful...

11:24.752 --> 11:26.787
block the highway...
carry signs...

11:26.820 --> 11:29.056
So he got $25,000
in return for what?

11:29.089 --> 11:30.791
He was supposed to call them,
tell them his route.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.259
( cell phone ringing)
Excuse me.

11:32.292 --> 11:33.160
Did he mention

11:33.193 --> 11:34.261
any names?

11:34.294 --> 11:35.829
Eppes.

11:35.863 --> 11:36.730
- No.
- Uh-huh.

11:36.764 --> 11:38.799
Look, you don't know Ray.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.167
He would never do
something like this

11:40.200 --> 11:41.835
if he thought people
were going to get hurt.

11:41.869 --> 11:45.205
It was just...
it was just the money.

11:45.238 --> 11:46.774
We needed it.

11:46.807 --> 11:49.242
Please, I'm telling you:
he's a victim here.

11:49.276 --> 11:50.377
Okay.

11:50.410 --> 11:51.378
Terry.

11:55.148 --> 11:58.485
L.A. Sheriffs
just found her husband.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.422
DAVID:
It's our missing truck driver,

12:02.455 --> 12:03.256
Raymond Sites.

12:03.290 --> 12:06.059
All right, let me inform
dispatch...

12:06.093 --> 12:09.396
Sheriff's office received an
anonymous tip about an hour ago.

12:09.429 --> 12:10.831
One shot,
side of the head.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.165
Any question
about whether

12:12.199 --> 12:14.134
these people are willing to kill
has been answered.

12:24.878 --> 12:27.114
So it turns out
the wife is right--

12:27.147 --> 12:28.816
Raymond is a victim.

12:28.849 --> 12:29.983
Coroner's report.

12:30.017 --> 12:31.518
Won't be much
consolation to the wife,

12:31.551 --> 12:33.386
but the bullet
that killed Raymond Sites

12:33.420 --> 12:35.222
only ended his life
by a few years.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.557
Autopsy found malignant tumors
up and down his spine.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.426
Yeah, well, I mean
he spent months

12:39.459 --> 12:41.028
breathing in nuclear waste.

12:41.061 --> 12:42.295
Yeah, so much
for Hauser's idea

12:42.329 --> 12:43.463
of safe leaks.

12:43.496 --> 12:45.332
Ballistics get us anything?

12:45.365 --> 12:47.134
Nine millimeter.
Doesn't match

12:47.167 --> 12:49.069
anything on file.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.070
Guys. Sheriff's Homicide said

12:50.103 --> 12:52.239
they found two cell phones
on Raymond Sites.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.406
One was his--
the other's unregistered.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.208
Phony CID code,

12:55.242 --> 12:57.044
and a single
voice message on it.

12:57.077 --> 13:00.080
MAN ( filtered ): We have the
truck you're looking for.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.983
The price is $20 million
for its safe return.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.517
If you don't pay what we ask,

13:04.551 --> 13:08.321
we will detonate the nuclear
material in Los Angeles.

13:08.355 --> 13:10.190
I'm sure you're
aware of the consequences

13:10.223 --> 13:11.158
if you force us to do that.

13:11.191 --> 13:13.360
You've got 12 hours
to arrange the money.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.896
We'll be in touch
with an account number

13:15.929 --> 13:17.430
and electronic transfer
instructions.

13:17.464 --> 13:18.932
Call came in

13:18.966 --> 13:20.167
53 minutes ago.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.302
Means we've
got 11 hours.

13:22.335 --> 13:23.303
Tell me about the caller.

13:23.336 --> 13:24.171
Uh... that it's

13:24.204 --> 13:26.306
from a cell phone
presents problems.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.340
It's digitally transmitted,

13:27.374 --> 13:28.541
which dulls down
the distinctive

13:28.575 --> 13:30.410
features of
the caller's voice, and

13:30.443 --> 13:32.445
cell phone companies
compress voice-mail files

13:32.479 --> 13:33.914
to conserve
storage space, so...

13:33.947 --> 13:35.082
it's further masked.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.083
Just best guess.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.484
No discernible regional dialect.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.252
White male.
Mid-20s to late-40s.

13:39.286 --> 13:40.287
All right, so not foreign then.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.454
I don't think so.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.223
If I had more
to work with, I could...

13:43.256 --> 13:44.491
It's all right. I understand.
Just get it

13:44.524 --> 13:45.959
to Strategic Operations,
all right?

13:45.993 --> 13:46.960
Okay.

13:46.994 --> 13:47.961
If they really intend

13:47.995 --> 13:49.129
to detonate a dirty bomb,

13:49.162 --> 13:50.964
nuclear material
is only one ingredient.

13:50.998 --> 13:52.499
Well, we should be checking
with any places

13:52.532 --> 13:54.167
that deal with high
explosives, so...

13:54.201 --> 13:55.402
construction sites,
military bases,

13:55.435 --> 13:56.536
fertilizer
wholesalers.

13:56.569 --> 13:59.072
So. It is a dirty bomb.

13:59.106 --> 14:01.909
No, Charlie, it is just
a threat right now. Okay?

14:01.942 --> 14:03.243
We have no idea where.

14:03.276 --> 14:05.278
Wherever they can
inflict the most damage.

14:05.312 --> 14:07.247
I mean,
all we know is Los Angeles.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.248
Los Angeles...

14:08.281 --> 14:09.282
Let me ask
you this.

14:09.316 --> 14:10.483
What do you think
the possibility

14:10.517 --> 14:12.052
of predicting where
they might strike is?

14:12.085 --> 14:13.954
A ton of variables,

14:13.987 --> 14:15.355
but we actually
know more

14:15.388 --> 14:17.190
than we think
we might because, for example,

14:17.224 --> 14:18.491
we know that
their target is urban,

14:18.525 --> 14:20.427
because they must have
the ability to move

14:20.460 --> 14:21.628
the material.
Right, but,

14:21.661 --> 14:23.030
to explode it in an urban area

14:23.063 --> 14:24.464
that means they got past
the roadblocks,

14:24.497 --> 14:26.233
which is an even
bigger problem, right,

14:26.266 --> 14:28.135
in terms of pinpointing
a target?

14:28.168 --> 14:30.503
Physical flexibility
may only be disguising

14:30.537 --> 14:32.305
a mathematical inflexibility.

14:32.339 --> 14:34.674
I don't understand. What?

14:34.707 --> 14:37.344
In observing their preparation
so far, I'm assuming

14:37.377 --> 14:39.479
that they're going
to be taking into account

14:39.512 --> 14:40.647
the exact
same variables I am

14:40.680 --> 14:42.315
to identify
an optimal target.

14:42.349 --> 14:44.017
Okay, now,
I'm considering

14:44.051 --> 14:46.453
weather, I'm considering wind,
structural landscape,

14:46.486 --> 14:47.988
population density,
traffic flow,

14:48.021 --> 14:49.522
and mind you,
these are fixed values,

14:49.556 --> 14:50.523
in a narrow
time frame

14:50.557 --> 14:52.025
like 11 hours.
Yeah.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.260
More like ten
and a half.

14:53.293 --> 14:54.261
Ten and a half.

14:54.294 --> 14:55.362
If I could just get my hands

14:55.395 --> 14:57.965
on some geo-spatial
radar-imagery data, you know,

14:57.998 --> 15:00.067
I-I'd be able to narrow
the list of targets,

15:00.100 --> 15:02.535
but there's still
a variable I don't have.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.504
The type of explosive
they'll use.

15:04.537 --> 15:06.373
That'll tell me the
effect of the impact.

15:06.406 --> 15:07.340
Don. Engineer

15:07.374 --> 15:08.675
from the Jet Propulsion Lab
just called in,

15:08.708 --> 15:10.210
responding
to an internal DOE alert.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.012
Says she was approached
awhile back by two men

15:12.045 --> 15:14.147
wanting to know
about handling nuclear material.

15:15.182 --> 15:16.149
Do we think she's for real?

15:16.183 --> 15:18.518
Says they specifically
talked about cesium-137.

15:23.323 --> 15:24.591
He asked a lot of questions,

15:24.624 --> 15:27.027
mostly about handling
high-level isotopes.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.629
Did either one of them say why
they wanted the information?

15:29.662 --> 15:31.664
They said they were
researching a screenplay.

15:31.698 --> 15:33.300
This being L.A.,
I didn't give it

15:33.333 --> 15:35.502
a second thought, and then
I saw the internal alert.

15:35.535 --> 15:38.605
You said they specifically
mentioned cesium-137?

15:38.638 --> 15:39.572
No. Cesium was my idea.

15:39.606 --> 15:42.442
My lab experimented
with cesium generators

15:42.475 --> 15:43.643
as a possible
power source

15:43.676 --> 15:44.511
aboard a deep-space probe,

15:44.544 --> 15:46.313
so it's an isotope
I'm familiar with.

15:46.346 --> 15:47.981
COMPUTER ( beeping ):
You have a message.

15:48.015 --> 15:49.382
Did they touch anything while
they were here?

15:49.416 --> 15:51.551
One of them maybe
had a Coke or something.

15:51.584 --> 15:52.585
Nothing else?

15:52.619 --> 15:54.221
No. Oh, no. Wait, uh...

15:54.254 --> 15:55.688
A book. Uh...

15:55.722 --> 15:58.125
If I remember, it was a
biography of Louis Slotin.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.626
DAVID:
Don't touch it.

15:59.659 --> 16:01.194
Please, just point to it.

16:01.228 --> 16:03.196
Who is Louis Slotin?

16:03.230 --> 16:05.465
He was a physicist at Los Alamos

16:05.498 --> 16:07.500
who personally handled
radioactive material

16:07.534 --> 16:08.668
for the Manhattan Project.

16:08.701 --> 16:11.604
They were curious as to how
he'd accidentally set off

16:11.638 --> 16:13.340
a chain reaction in his lab.

16:13.373 --> 16:14.574
How did he do that?

16:14.607 --> 16:17.710
Slotin was keeping two halves
of a plutonium sphere apart

16:17.744 --> 16:19.612
using a screwdriver.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.748
The screwdriver slipped
and the halves came together,

16:21.781 --> 16:23.616
generating a vast flux
of radiation.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.485
He used his body
to try and protect

16:25.518 --> 16:26.319
the other scientists

16:26.353 --> 16:29.122
in the lab.
He died nine days later.

16:29.156 --> 16:31.224
Total disintegration
of internal functions.

17:00.553 --> 17:03.356
ALAN:
Charlie, you in there?

17:03.390 --> 17:04.657
Ha!

17:04.691 --> 17:06.359
What are you two geniuses into
now?

17:06.393 --> 17:07.694
Hey, Dad.

17:07.727 --> 17:10.463
And what are
my old city planning maps

17:10.497 --> 17:12.599
doing out like this?
What's happening?

17:12.632 --> 17:15.502
Well, no one's really
supposed to know.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.437
LARRY: Charles, perhaps it would
be best

17:17.470 --> 17:20.340
to inform your father
of the impending Armageddon.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.541
Armageddon?

17:21.574 --> 17:23.110
- No, don't tell me.
- You really are...

17:23.143 --> 17:24.211
You two spotted another one

17:24.244 --> 17:26.546
of those asteroids hurtling
towards the Earth, huh?

17:26.579 --> 17:28.681
Several thousand, actually,
but that Armageddon

17:28.715 --> 17:30.150
we have decades to resolve.

17:30.183 --> 17:31.551
Charlie,

17:31.584 --> 17:32.552
what is he talking about?

17:32.585 --> 17:34.687
Nothing... A truck carrying

17:34.721 --> 17:38.358
nuclear waste
was hijacked. Yesterday.

17:38.391 --> 17:39.392
What?

17:39.426 --> 17:41.694
Now, wait a minute.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.097
Why didn't I hear anything
about this on the news?

17:44.131 --> 17:45.698
Because they're
not telling anyone.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.867
What do you mean, they're
not telling anyone?

17:47.900 --> 17:50.203
How the hell are people
supposed to protect themselves?

17:50.237 --> 17:51.271
In the first place,

17:51.304 --> 17:52.672
uh, we-we're not even sure

17:52.705 --> 17:54.674
that there, that
there is a bomb, so...

17:54.707 --> 17:55.475
A bomb!?

17:55.508 --> 17:56.576
Well, we don't know

17:56.609 --> 17:58.745
where it's going to go off.

17:58.778 --> 17:59.779
Well, maybe not.

17:59.812 --> 18:02.782
But I would suggest
that people quickly taking

18:02.815 --> 18:04.651
a ride out of town
in an easterly direction

18:04.684 --> 18:05.785
might be of help right now.

18:05.818 --> 18:08.688
Well, possibly not, with these
current wind conditions.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.790
Look, an evacuation
without information

18:10.823 --> 18:12.759
will lead to mass public panic.

18:12.792 --> 18:14.261
Well, speaking
for the huddled masses,

18:14.294 --> 18:16.429
I'd rather not have some
government official making

18:16.463 --> 18:18.631
that decision for me
right now, thank you very much.

18:18.665 --> 18:20.767
And what are you doing
with my maps?

18:20.800 --> 18:23.136
You really are something,
you know that?

18:23.170 --> 18:24.604
The public
has a right...

18:24.637 --> 18:25.805
Hey, hey, hey.

18:25.838 --> 18:27.607
I said he's not
supposed to know...

18:27.640 --> 18:28.541
He i a planner.

18:31.811 --> 18:34.314
You know what, Dad?

18:34.347 --> 18:35.582
You can help us.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.617
How can I help you?

18:37.650 --> 18:39.386
Charlie, I'm not a physicist,

18:39.419 --> 18:42.455
and I'm certainly not an expert
on nuclear contamination.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.424
But you were a
city planner.

18:44.457 --> 18:49.396
You know about urban density,
and these are your maps.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.169
DON: Okay, listen up, everybody.
Gather round.

18:56.203 --> 18:57.204
We got a possible suspect.

18:57.237 --> 18:59.739
Fingerprint match
from the book we got at JPL

18:59.772 --> 19:04.211
gave us this man,
Darryl Gerth, G-e-r-t-h.

19:04.244 --> 19:05.645
White male, 29 years old.

19:05.678 --> 19:08.181
Did five years for a
failed armored-car robbery.

19:08.215 --> 19:09.716
I want to run down
all his known associates,

19:09.749 --> 19:11.418
I mean anybody who ever
did a heist with him.

19:11.451 --> 19:14.287
We gotta find this guy ASAP.
Okay, let's go.

19:14.321 --> 19:15.188
TERRY:
Don, come here.

19:15.222 --> 19:17.657
Five pounds of C-4
explosive is missing

19:17.690 --> 19:19.192
from the Naval Weapons Station
at Seal Beach.

19:19.226 --> 19:20.460
When did that happen?

19:20.493 --> 19:21.461
Inventory is taken
every 14 days.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.463
Last one was eight days
ago, so within the week.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.832
How does someone get access
to C-4 in a Naval base?

19:25.865 --> 19:27.434
Enlisted men,
civilian contractors,

19:27.467 --> 19:28.968
maintenance crews,
they'd all have access.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.737
All right, run it down.
If it's the same people

19:30.770 --> 19:32.472
who stole the truck,
they got nuclear material,

19:32.505 --> 19:34.207
high explosive,
and that is a dirty bomb.

19:34.241 --> 19:36.309
Our suspect's parole officer
hasn't seen him in weeks.

19:36.343 --> 19:38.378
No known address, but I have
a line on the foster parents.

19:38.411 --> 19:39.346
Maybe he stays in touch.

19:39.379 --> 19:41.414
Okay, good. Get him in here
and talk to him.

19:41.448 --> 19:42.915
I'm gonna go tell Charlie
about the C-4.

19:42.949 --> 19:44.684
It's the one variable
he's been missing.

19:48.455 --> 19:51.991
Some kids, by the time you
get 'em, the damage is done.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.926
Nothing you do
makes a difference.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.362
Darryl got into trouble?

19:55.395 --> 19:56.363
Always,

19:56.396 --> 19:57.364
and the worst part,

19:57.397 --> 19:58.598
he was a, a ringleader.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.767
He got other kids
in trouble, too.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.335
Even our own son, Mark.

20:02.369 --> 20:04.404
Arrested when he was 16
for helping Darryl steal

20:04.437 --> 20:05.305
Social Security checks.

20:05.338 --> 20:06.473
We need
to locate Darryl.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.408
Is your son still
in contact with him?

20:08.441 --> 20:09.809
Oh, God, no.

20:09.842 --> 20:10.977
Part of his probation,

20:11.010 --> 20:13.480
Mark joined the Navy.
Navy got him

20:13.513 --> 20:15.348
squared away,
better believe that.

20:15.382 --> 20:16.749
Mr. Watson, where's your son
currently stationed?

20:16.783 --> 20:18.351
Uh, Seal Beach.

20:18.385 --> 20:19.652
Naval Weapons Station.

20:19.686 --> 20:20.920
The same place
the explosives

20:20.953 --> 20:22.255
- were missing from.
- Yeah.

20:22.289 --> 20:23.756
W-w-what's going,
what's going on?

20:23.790 --> 20:25.758
Where does your son live?
Does he live on base?

20:25.792 --> 20:26.826
No. He has an apartment
over in Fullerton.

20:26.859 --> 20:28.628
Fullerton. Thank you.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.039
Clear.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.574
Clear.

20:44.577 --> 20:45.612
Got something.

20:45.645 --> 20:47.347
Got a minty smell.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.349
Cyclohexanone vapor.

20:49.382 --> 20:50.950
And we have...

20:50.983 --> 20:52.652
waxy cellophane wrapper.

20:55.522 --> 20:56.489
C-4.

20:58.525 --> 21:00.493
Bomb's for real, no question.

21:00.527 --> 21:01.461
All right, well...

21:01.494 --> 21:03.463
we know that.
( phone ringing )

21:03.496 --> 21:04.397
Agent Eppes!

21:05.365 --> 21:06.766
Cell phone's ringing.

21:08.668 --> 21:10.337
Put it on speaker.

21:14.574 --> 21:15.942
This is Agent Eppes.

21:15.975 --> 21:17.410
MAN ( filtered ):
Grab a pen, Eppes.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.946
I'm going to give you
an account number.

21:19.979 --> 21:22.549
As soon as we hang up,
you'll transfer the money.

21:22.582 --> 21:24.384
Wait, wait. Hold-hold on.
You said 12 hours.

21:24.417 --> 21:27.420
It's only been six. You gotta
give me more time than that.

21:27.454 --> 21:29.389
You there?

21:30.757 --> 21:33.092
Maybe what you need
is a little motivation, Eppes.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.861
Wait. Look.

21:34.894 --> 21:36.463
Say, downtown, in one hour.

21:36.496 --> 21:37.597
Gotta give me
more time than that.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.399
One hour. We'll be in touch.

21:41.634 --> 21:44.537
Charlie, you gotta tell me
what you got now.

21:44.571 --> 21:47.340
Well, don't we have
like six hours?

21:47.374 --> 21:48.475
Well, they pushed it up.

21:48.508 --> 21:49.476
They pushed it...

21:49.509 --> 21:51.478
Ah, he needs to know now.

21:51.511 --> 21:52.845
Well, we still have
algorithms to test

21:52.879 --> 21:55.515
and variables to explore here.

21:55.548 --> 21:57.384
Charlie!

21:57.417 --> 21:58.418
Okay, um... okay, we've

21:58.451 --> 22:00.520
pinpointed seven likely targets.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.589
There's one in Westwood,
there's two in Century City.

22:02.622 --> 22:04.090
- Downtown.
- Forget everything else.

22:04.123 --> 22:05.925
- Just tell me downtown.
- Downtown. Okay.

22:05.958 --> 22:07.827
He needs downtown so,
okay, there's, there's

22:07.860 --> 22:08.828
there's two.

22:08.861 --> 22:10.497
There's one in Driscoll Plaza

22:10.530 --> 22:12.432
and another in Angeles Square.

22:12.465 --> 22:13.666
Angeles Square?

22:13.700 --> 22:15.368
Wait a minute.

22:15.402 --> 22:17.904
Driscoll Plaza...
and Angeles Square.

22:17.937 --> 22:18.738
No good.

22:18.771 --> 22:20.640
We've got 58 minutes
and nowhere near

22:20.673 --> 22:22.442
the manpower to clear two areas.

22:22.475 --> 22:23.410
Right.

22:23.443 --> 22:24.310
Even if we try,
the traffic would gridlock.

22:24.343 --> 22:25.612
We couldn't
get our own men in there.

22:25.645 --> 22:26.646
All right, Charlie, you

22:26.679 --> 22:28.014
gotta make a choice.
You gotta give me one now.

22:28.047 --> 22:29.048
Just choose one.

22:29.081 --> 22:30.049
Just one,
one of them.

22:30.082 --> 22:31.384
Statistically,
they're both

22:31.418 --> 22:32.251
of nearly equal

22:32.284 --> 22:33.786
- probability.
- Right. Mathematically,

22:33.820 --> 22:34.921
we have no
justification

22:34.954 --> 22:36.088
for choosing one
over the other.

22:36.122 --> 22:37.724
Donnie,
go with Angeles Square.

22:37.757 --> 22:39.459
Dad, how do you
know that? Charlie says

22:39.492 --> 22:40.593
it doesn't hold up
mathematically.

22:40.627 --> 22:42.061
I know what Charlie says,

22:42.094 --> 22:43.963
but I know these maps,
and I would choose

22:43.996 --> 22:44.531
Angeles Square.

22:44.564 --> 22:46.733
All right, tell me why.

22:46.766 --> 22:47.734
It's the height

22:47.767 --> 22:48.568
of the buildings.
It creates

22:48.601 --> 22:50.136
what we used
to call an urban canyon.

22:50.169 --> 22:52.605
The air currents
through the buildings

22:52.639 --> 22:54.907
spread
the radiation much further.

22:54.941 --> 22:56.743
If I wanted
to inflict as much damage

22:56.776 --> 22:58.645
as I could,
that's where I would go.

22:58.678 --> 23:00.046
Angeles Square, I'm telling you.

23:00.079 --> 23:01.814
All right.
Let's evacuate Angeles Square.

23:01.848 --> 23:02.882
Let's go.

23:04.551 --> 23:06.553
( sirens blaring )

23:11.624 --> 23:14.527
WOMAN: ... if I can get you to
go to the evacuation center...?

23:14.561 --> 23:16.663
Come on, folks.
Move it along.

23:16.696 --> 23:17.897
Move it along, sir.

23:17.930 --> 23:19.699
( horns honking )

23:25.738 --> 23:27.039
We're clearing the area now.

23:31.778 --> 23:34.881
All right, well, all the
buildings have been evacuated.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.649
With 15 minutes,
seems odd we haven't

23:36.683 --> 23:37.884
heard from them,
don't you think?

23:37.917 --> 23:39.218
Yeah, bomb
squad is searching,

23:39.251 --> 23:40.720
but the device
could be concealed

23:40.753 --> 23:41.821
anywhere on this plaza.

23:41.854 --> 23:43.222
We got a lot
of ground to cover.

23:43.255 --> 23:45.492
Well, we got no choice.
We got to do what we can.

23:45.525 --> 23:46.459
Keep your eye
on your watches.

23:46.493 --> 23:48.495
Make sure you leave
at least five minutes

23:48.528 --> 23:49.562
to clear the area, okay?

23:49.596 --> 23:50.630
All right, so you
guys got that?

23:50.663 --> 23:52.565
Quarter after, we're
out of here, no matter what.

23:52.599 --> 23:53.533
- Got it.
- Okay.

24:11.851 --> 24:13.886
( sirens blaring )

24:17.189 --> 24:18.825
Got any word
on casualties?

24:18.858 --> 24:20.827
Two of our guys got it
pretty bad.

24:20.860 --> 24:21.694
Doesn't look good.

24:21.728 --> 24:24.030
How close were you all
to the blast?

24:24.063 --> 24:26.198
- 80, 100 feet.
- Are you sure?

24:26.232 --> 24:28.234
- We were close.
- My ears won't stop ringing.

24:28.267 --> 24:30.069
I'm not picking up any
radiation. You're clean.

24:30.102 --> 24:31.237
You all are.

24:31.270 --> 24:32.739
Thank you.

24:33.940 --> 24:35.942
All right, so it
wasn't a dirty bomb.

24:40.913 --> 24:43.516
D.O.E. just finished
analyzing the bomb.

24:43.550 --> 24:45.885
Their tests failed to find
a trace of cesium-137,

24:45.918 --> 24:47.620
or any nuclear material.

24:47.654 --> 24:50.022
All right,
so they've still got it.

24:50.056 --> 24:51.123
Why didn't they use it?

24:51.157 --> 24:52.792
Raymond Sites was
murdered, right?

24:52.825 --> 24:54.293
These guys killed
to get their hands on

24:54.326 --> 24:55.895
what was in that truck.

24:55.928 --> 24:58.798
Yeah. I mean, everything
they have done has been planned.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.600
They only thing they haven't
kept to is a time frame.

25:00.633 --> 25:02.669
First they say 12 hours,
then they say an hour,

25:02.702 --> 25:04.236
then they blow
the bomb 11 minutes early.

25:04.270 --> 25:05.772
And why didn't
they call back,

25:05.805 --> 25:06.973
give us a chance to pay?

25:08.975 --> 25:10.543
What if they didn't
use the cesium

25:10.577 --> 25:11.744
because they didn't have to?

25:11.778 --> 25:12.945
Like, I hold a gun
to your back,

25:12.979 --> 25:14.614
you're going to do what I say.

25:14.647 --> 25:15.848
Doesn't matter
if I have the gun,

25:15.882 --> 25:17.016
as long as you think I do.

25:17.049 --> 25:19.686
They wanted us to think they
were blowing a dirty bomb.

25:19.719 --> 25:21.287
So they steal a truck.

25:21.320 --> 25:22.855
That gets
our attention.

25:22.889 --> 25:24.290
Then we do just
what they wanted.

25:24.323 --> 25:25.692
Which is what?

25:25.725 --> 25:27.026
What'd we do?

25:27.059 --> 25:29.128
Evacuated Angeles Square.

25:40.907 --> 25:43.643
Well, we didn't do
so bad today, did we?

25:43.676 --> 25:45.177
No, today, was good.

25:45.211 --> 25:47.213
But what about tomorrow?

25:48.314 --> 25:50.983
( grunts )

25:51.017 --> 25:52.585
Yeah, uh...

25:52.619 --> 25:55.087
You know,
I think I understand

25:55.121 --> 25:57.857
why you like helping
Don so much.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.792
It's not a bad feeling.

26:05.164 --> 26:06.866
What's the matter, Charlie?

26:06.899 --> 26:08.968
You've got that look
that you get

26:09.001 --> 26:11.871
when you can't stop
worrying about something.

26:11.904 --> 26:13.139
He's right.

26:13.172 --> 26:15.041
You seem a little perturbed.

26:17.076 --> 26:20.713
You're still not mad about
my pulling that phone

26:20.747 --> 26:22.749
out of your hand, are you?

26:22.782 --> 26:25.117
I was going to say
Driscoll Plaza.

26:25.151 --> 26:27.253
Huh?

26:27.286 --> 26:29.989
Before you grabbed
the phone out of my hand

26:30.022 --> 26:33.693
I was... I was about
to say Driscoll Plaza,

26:33.726 --> 26:35.161
and I would've been wrong.

26:35.194 --> 26:36.328
Oh.

26:36.362 --> 26:38.097
Well, come on, Charlie.

26:38.130 --> 26:41.701
I was the one that didn't give
you the right variables.

26:43.870 --> 26:46.105
You know, the heights
of the buildings.

26:46.138 --> 26:48.074
Listen, if you've got
one failing,

26:48.107 --> 26:50.910
it's only that you don't
think like a criminal.

26:50.943 --> 26:53.145
Of course, what does
that say about me?

26:53.179 --> 26:54.180
( chuckles )

26:54.213 --> 26:55.648
CHARLIE: I would've been wrong.

26:59.719 --> 27:01.788
Why would they want us to
evacuate Angeles Square?

27:01.821 --> 27:02.889
And, why not tell us
it was

27:02.922 --> 27:04.123
Angeles Square
in the first place?

27:04.156 --> 27:06.158
'Cause by narrowing
the threat to downtown,

27:06.192 --> 27:08.695
they tell us and they keep us
off balance at the same time.

27:08.728 --> 27:09.929
I mean, there's
got to be

27:09.962 --> 27:11.097
something here, there's just got
to be.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.231
DAVID:
Gerth is a thief, right?

27:12.264 --> 27:14.734
So what was he after?

27:14.767 --> 27:16.068
What about
the Diamond Mart?

27:16.102 --> 27:18.104
Combined inventory
has to be significant.

27:18.137 --> 27:20.139
I think it's outside
the evacuation zone.

27:20.172 --> 27:21.107
There's no banks.

27:21.140 --> 27:24.443
What's in this building?
This 2215 building?

27:24.476 --> 27:26.312
There we go. Uh...

27:26.345 --> 27:29.081
a ticket office,
we got two brokerage firms

27:29.115 --> 27:32.151
and Aronson Conservators,
they do art restoration.

27:32.184 --> 27:33.953
TERRY:
I talked to your assistant.

27:33.986 --> 27:36.088
She says nobody knows
about the work you do.

27:36.122 --> 27:38.224
Well, with paintings
of this importance,

27:38.257 --> 27:40.192
it's just safer
not to publicize.

27:40.226 --> 27:42.194
Besides, all the museums
know who we are,

27:42.228 --> 27:44.096
and the larger
private collections.

27:44.130 --> 27:46.332
( whispers ):
Let's see.

27:46.365 --> 27:48.434
Oh, no.

27:48.467 --> 27:51.938
Oh, no!
I-I locked that vault myself.

27:51.971 --> 27:53.873
Even with the bomb threat and
the...

27:53.906 --> 27:55.174
and the policemen yelling at me.

27:55.207 --> 27:56.275
You're sure?

27:56.308 --> 27:57.376
I locked the vault!

27:57.409 --> 27:59.879
All right, all right.
Look, don't touch anything.

27:59.912 --> 28:01.447
Oh! Oh, my God.

28:01.480 --> 28:03.115
It's... it's...
They're all gone.

28:03.149 --> 28:04.483
Every one of them.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.118
Ms. Aronson, tell me
exactly... any...

28:06.152 --> 28:07.219
I am fine. The paintings are
gone.

28:07.253 --> 28:08.888
I need to know exactly what's
missing.

28:08.921 --> 28:11.958
Uh, six Van Goghs,
for the LACMA exhibit,

28:11.991 --> 28:13.192
and two Rembrandts,
a Degas...

28:13.225 --> 28:14.360
What is it worth?

28:14.393 --> 28:15.828
It's not about the money.

28:15.862 --> 28:17.196
We're insured
for the money.

28:17.229 --> 28:18.364
It's about the significance.

28:18.397 --> 28:21.067
Well, we're going to need
an approximate dollar value.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.102
I don't know.
Close to $100 million.

28:23.135 --> 28:24.971
Security system runs
through the basement.

28:25.004 --> 28:26.272
Evacuation gave them
all the time

28:26.305 --> 28:27.373
and access they needed.

28:27.406 --> 28:28.274
The streets are blocked.

28:28.307 --> 28:30.209
How would they get
the heavy equipment

28:30.242 --> 28:31.878
past the security perimeter?

28:31.911 --> 28:34.380
Well, they could have been
inside the building already.

28:39.151 --> 28:41.087
Eh... check this out.

28:45.557 --> 28:47.293
DAVID: Rental agent from the
building

28:47.326 --> 28:49.161
where the artwork was stolen

28:49.195 --> 28:50.963
picked out Gerth
from a photo array.

28:50.997 --> 28:52.799
Says he came by
about two months ago,

28:52.832 --> 28:54.100
leased some office space

28:54.133 --> 28:55.201
on the ground floor.

28:55.234 --> 28:57.103
Went by the name
of Donald Garrity.

28:57.136 --> 28:58.237
Garrity...

28:58.270 --> 29:00.239
That's the same name on
Raymond Sites' cashier's check.

29:00.272 --> 29:01.540
Yeah, that's the same alias.

29:01.573 --> 29:03.242
Where's our list
of truck rentals?

29:04.510 --> 29:06.078
Probably watched
from the window.

29:06.112 --> 29:07.313
Waited till
everyone was out

29:07.346 --> 29:08.447
then helped themselves
to the art.

29:08.480 --> 29:09.748
We were played.

29:11.818 --> 29:12.952
Bingo.

29:12.985 --> 29:14.020
Garrity.

29:14.053 --> 29:15.287
Rented a 25-foot van
out of Avis

29:15.321 --> 29:16.455
in Homewood, California.

29:16.488 --> 29:17.556
25 feet. That's
large enough

29:17.589 --> 29:19.826
- to transport those casks.
- Yeah, do me a favor.

29:19.859 --> 29:22.194
Get on the phone, see if you can
get the address they used

29:22.228 --> 29:23.262
on the rental agreement.

29:25.932 --> 29:27.566
All teams be advised--
watch your fire.

29:27.599 --> 29:30.202
We have possible hazardous
material inside the target area.

29:30.236 --> 29:32.338
- Roger that. All clear.
- All right, that's clear.

29:32.371 --> 29:34.106
Let's do it.

29:40.546 --> 29:42.882
Three... two... one...
execute.

29:42.915 --> 29:44.851
FBI! FBI! FBI!

29:44.884 --> 29:46.085
Get down! FBI!

29:46.118 --> 29:48.120
FBI! FBI!
( shouting )

29:50.156 --> 29:51.090
Down! Down!

29:51.123 --> 29:52.291
( shouting )

29:52.324 --> 29:54.460
Gimme your hands now.

29:54.493 --> 29:55.561
You two, this way.

29:55.594 --> 29:57.096
Let's go.

29:58.430 --> 30:00.166
- Let's go.
- Clear!

30:04.336 --> 30:06.138
Gimme your right hand.
Get up!

30:12.344 --> 30:13.412
Damn.

30:13.445 --> 30:15.381
Nothing.

30:15.414 --> 30:17.383
The casks aren't here.

30:17.416 --> 30:18.985
Where's the cesium?

30:19.018 --> 30:20.319
Don, I got the art.

30:20.352 --> 30:22.221
Look at me.
Where's that cesium?

30:22.254 --> 30:23.389
You're going to tell me

30:23.422 --> 30:24.390
where those casks are.

30:24.423 --> 30:25.925
I got no idea
what you're talking about, man.

30:27.193 --> 30:28.227
Let's go.

30:29.896 --> 30:30.462
Come on.

30:34.166 --> 30:35.634
Right now, I can tie you to the
murder

30:35.667 --> 30:37.203
of Raymond Sites,
to the theft

30:37.236 --> 30:38.938
of nuclear material,
the Angeles Square bombing.

30:38.971 --> 30:40.072
If you're lucky,
you're gonna spend

30:40.106 --> 30:42.074
the rest of your life
in a maximum security prison.

30:42.108 --> 30:43.075
Oh, you think so, huh?

30:43.109 --> 30:43.976
And that's if you're lucky.

30:44.010 --> 30:44.977
Now, I wanna know
where that truck is.

30:45.011 --> 30:47.179
That's good, 'cause I want
some things, too.

30:48.948 --> 30:50.316
All right,
what do you want?

30:50.349 --> 30:52.351
The first thing I want
is for you to let me go.

30:52.384 --> 30:53.452
Well, that ain't
gonna happen.

30:55.988 --> 30:57.223
Well...

31:00.326 --> 31:02.028
Then you're going

31:02.061 --> 31:03.595
to be looking
at a dirty bomb after all.

31:03.629 --> 31:05.231
What?

31:05.264 --> 31:08.667
Oh, you didn't think
I had a backup plan?

31:08.700 --> 31:10.102
TERRY:
The explosives

31:10.136 --> 31:12.371
were stolen from the Naval
Weapons Center.

31:12.404 --> 31:14.506
The same base
that you're stationed.

31:14.540 --> 31:18.277
The truck driver, Raymond Sites,
shot in the head.

31:18.310 --> 31:19.678
That's murder
with special circumstances.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.347
I didn't have anything
to do with that.

31:21.380 --> 31:22.181
I wasn't even there.

31:22.214 --> 31:24.016
There or not,
you're on the hook.

31:25.384 --> 31:27.253
Mark, the only way
to help yourself

31:27.286 --> 31:29.088
is to help us find the truck.

31:30.589 --> 31:32.558
The Navy kid's scared,

31:32.591 --> 31:34.293
but he's not giving
us the truck.

31:34.326 --> 31:35.394
My guy wasn't talking either.

31:35.427 --> 31:37.196
Yeah, and Gerth thinks

31:37.229 --> 31:38.230
he's going to trade
that truck

31:38.264 --> 31:39.265
for a free ticket out of here.

31:39.298 --> 31:41.100
Look, let me
float something.

31:41.133 --> 31:43.135
We've been operating
under the assumption

31:43.169 --> 31:44.536
that those casks
have been moved.

31:44.570 --> 31:45.637
What if they haven't?

31:45.671 --> 31:47.506
What if they're on
the original truck

31:47.539 --> 31:50.109
exactly as they were the day
they were stolen?

31:50.142 --> 31:51.277
Like you said before,

31:51.310 --> 31:53.379
they only need us
to think they moved them.

31:53.412 --> 31:54.080
Right.

31:54.113 --> 31:55.081
That would explain why the truck

31:55.114 --> 31:57.183
in the warehouse had no trace
of radiation.

31:57.216 --> 31:59.518
This truck is sitting inside our
perimeter; it's not outside.

32:02.554 --> 32:04.223
Larry and I have been doing

32:04.256 --> 32:06.592
some research on tracking
radiation signatures.

32:06.625 --> 32:09.295
Now, between
the sensors that scan

32:09.328 --> 32:10.129
from planes and those you could

32:10.162 --> 32:11.964
install at random points
in the area,

32:11.998 --> 32:13.299
we would be able
to triangulate

32:13.332 --> 32:15.601
a location for that
radioactive material.

32:15.634 --> 32:16.602
All right, well, that's great.

32:16.635 --> 32:17.603
How long would it take?

32:17.636 --> 32:19.138
( sighs )

32:19.171 --> 32:21.407
Like a... like a week.
Or maybe two.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.175
A week? Charlie,
the truck is

32:23.209 --> 32:24.310
leaking radiation,
you understand?

32:24.343 --> 32:26.045
He's right, Charles.

32:26.078 --> 32:29.081
I mean, these casks were not
designed to contain cesium

32:29.115 --> 32:30.349
for extended
periods of time.

32:30.382 --> 32:31.417
This material

32:31.450 --> 32:34.520
in particular has
an insidious method of attack.

32:34.553 --> 32:36.288
Which is...?

32:36.322 --> 32:38.557
Look, even
in small amounts,

32:38.590 --> 32:40.026
whether ingested or inhaled,

32:40.059 --> 32:41.527
they spread throughout
the entire body,

32:41.560 --> 32:43.562
they invade and destroy the soft
tissue.

32:43.595 --> 32:45.331
Longer exposure

32:45.364 --> 32:48.367
and we're talking acute
radiation poisoning;

32:48.400 --> 32:49.735
the Walking Ghost phase.

32:49.768 --> 32:51.370
The Walking Ghost phase?

32:51.403 --> 32:53.072
Yes, like the people
in Chernobyl.

32:53.105 --> 32:56.242
Somebody starts feeling
nauseous, they vomit,

32:56.275 --> 32:58.310
they start feeling better,
they think they are better.

32:58.344 --> 32:59.311
But no, it's...

32:59.345 --> 33:01.413
it's just
a grace period.

33:01.447 --> 33:05.117
A week later,
it's internal bleeding

33:05.151 --> 33:06.452
and certain death.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.554
( sighs )

33:11.423 --> 33:13.525
You said you have the guys
that stole the truck, right?

33:13.559 --> 33:15.361
That's right.

33:15.394 --> 33:16.195
They don't know where it is?

33:16.228 --> 33:18.064
Well, Charlie,
they're not talking.

33:18.097 --> 33:19.098
- None of them?
- No.

33:19.131 --> 33:20.399
They're trying
to use the truck

33:20.432 --> 33:21.500
as leverage, if anything.

33:21.533 --> 33:22.634
They had a plan going in.

33:22.668 --> 33:23.735
We got 'em separated.

33:23.769 --> 33:25.804
We're trying to play
them against each other, but...

33:25.837 --> 33:28.207
What about putting
them together?

33:28.240 --> 33:30.476
No, Charlie.
You keep suspects

33:30.509 --> 33:31.543
isolated in the dark.

33:31.577 --> 33:32.578
That's how it works.

33:32.611 --> 33:34.513
I understand that.
That, that's not

33:34.546 --> 33:36.515
what I'm speaking about.
I'm actually talking

33:36.548 --> 33:38.317
about something
completely different

33:38.350 --> 33:39.718
I'm talking about
something called

33:39.751 --> 33:41.153
"The Prisoner's Dilemma."

33:41.187 --> 33:42.221
Game theory.

33:42.254 --> 33:43.055
Game theory.

33:43.089 --> 33:44.556
The mathematics
of decision-making.

33:44.590 --> 33:46.092
- Uh-huh.
- How to achieve

33:46.125 --> 33:49.395
the optimal outcome
from a complex situation.

33:49.428 --> 33:50.596
So for instance, um...

33:54.100 --> 33:56.668
...say two people
were to commit a crime.

33:56.702 --> 33:58.370
Now, if neither of them talk,
they each get a year.

33:58.404 --> 34:00.206
If one of them talks,

34:00.239 --> 34:01.006
he gets no time at all,

34:01.039 --> 34:02.508
and the other guy
gets five years.

34:02.541 --> 34:04.443
If both of them talk,

34:04.476 --> 34:05.444
they each get two years.

34:05.477 --> 34:07.746
So you see, unless
they can trust each other

34:07.779 --> 34:11.117
not to say anything,
talking is the best strategy.

34:11.150 --> 34:12.484
Yeah, but I
already told you

34:12.518 --> 34:14.353
they're not talking.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.388
Well, maybe that's because
none of them realize

34:16.422 --> 34:18.124
how much the others have
to lose.

34:22.594 --> 34:24.130
All right,
listen up.

34:24.163 --> 34:25.531
We're going to do
things a little different.

34:25.564 --> 34:27.199
This is Charlie Eppes.

34:27.233 --> 34:29.468
He's a professor of mathematics
and an excellent teacher.

34:29.501 --> 34:30.536
What we're going to do
is find out

34:30.569 --> 34:31.837
if any of you
are good students.

34:31.870 --> 34:33.272
What kind of crap
is this?

34:33.305 --> 34:34.373
Shut your mouth.

34:36.175 --> 34:37.876
Good afternoon.

34:37.909 --> 34:41.513
What I'm going to do here today,
mathematically,

34:41.547 --> 34:43.682
is construct a risk assessment
for each of you.

34:43.715 --> 34:46.318
Basically quantify,
if I can,

34:46.352 --> 34:48.287
the various choices you face...

34:49.821 --> 34:51.590
their respective consequences.

34:51.623 --> 34:53.325
The only ones
facing consequences

34:53.359 --> 34:55.394
are those people who are
going to get hurt by that truck.

34:55.427 --> 34:56.562
Gerth, I'm not going
to warn you again.

34:59.198 --> 35:00.832
Okay...
( clears throat )

35:00.866 --> 35:04.536
So, "G" is for Gerth.

35:04.570 --> 35:07.473
Uh, "W" is for Watson,
"F" is for Fitchman, okay?

35:07.506 --> 35:09.575
I've assigned some variables
based on data

35:09.608 --> 35:11.610
like respective ages,
criminal records,

35:11.643 --> 35:13.245
loved ones on the outside.

35:13.279 --> 35:14.180
WATSON:
Wait.

35:14.213 --> 35:15.414
What does that have
to do with anything?

35:15.447 --> 35:18.550
Having family on the outside
would effect your motivation,

35:18.584 --> 35:19.351
wouldn't it?

35:19.385 --> 35:22.388
Your desire to stay out of
prison.

35:26.658 --> 35:28.494
Okay.

35:28.527 --> 35:30.162
( chuckles )

35:40.639 --> 35:42.874
Okay, there it is.

35:42.908 --> 35:44.576
There it is. All right.

35:44.610 --> 35:49.448
Fitchman, you have a risk
assessment of 14.9.

35:52.518 --> 35:53.519
"W..."

35:53.552 --> 35:57.323
yours is 26.4.

35:58.524 --> 36:00.626
"G..."

36:00.659 --> 36:06.332
you have a risk assessment
of... 7.9.

36:06.365 --> 36:08.734
What's that
supposed to mean?

36:08.767 --> 36:10.502
What that means
is old Mark here

36:10.536 --> 36:12.571
has the most to lose
by going to prison.

36:12.604 --> 36:13.805
That's exactly what it means.

36:16.708 --> 36:18.910
Don't listen to him, Mark.

36:20.346 --> 36:21.647
Hey, look at me.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.582
Mark...

36:23.615 --> 36:24.916
this is truth.

36:24.950 --> 36:26.652
This math here proves it.

36:26.685 --> 36:29.655
You stand to give up the most.
You're the youngest.

36:29.688 --> 36:30.989
You have parents
you're still

36:31.022 --> 36:34.226
in touch with
on the outside, right?

36:34.260 --> 36:36.562
You have the shortest
criminal record.

36:36.595 --> 36:37.829
Hey, why don't you
just save it, huh?

36:37.863 --> 36:38.930
You are the youngest,

36:38.964 --> 36:40.666
you have the most potential

36:40.699 --> 36:42.501
to make something
of yourself.

36:42.534 --> 36:43.635
( Watson sighs )

36:43.669 --> 36:44.770
And the most to gain
if you do.

36:44.803 --> 36:47.005
Mark, listen to me, boy. Hey...

36:47.038 --> 36:48.674
Look, I spoke
to your father.

36:48.707 --> 36:49.575
Mark...

36:49.608 --> 36:51.477
He said you're not
a bad kid, it's just

36:51.510 --> 36:53.645
that Darryl here has been a bad
influence on you.

36:53.679 --> 36:56.682
So this is your chance to prove
him right, your one chance.

36:56.715 --> 36:57.516
( chuckles )

36:57.549 --> 36:59.985
Okay, I'll tell you
what you want.

37:00.018 --> 37:01.119
- Good.
- Mark!

37:01.152 --> 37:03.255
You said nobody would get hurt.
And then what'd you do?

37:03.289 --> 37:05.424
You just shot that guy
for no reason.

37:05.457 --> 37:05.724
I'll kill you if you talk.

37:05.757 --> 37:06.525
Yeah.

37:06.558 --> 37:07.225
Do you understand? I'll kill
you!

37:07.259 --> 37:08.994
Hey, hey! Get him out of here.

37:09.027 --> 37:09.661
Wait, wait,
I'll tell you something.

37:09.695 --> 37:11.530
I mean, I got, like, a 14.9.

37:11.563 --> 37:13.332
That's pretty good, right?

37:13.365 --> 37:15.734
What? You didn't think
I had a back-up plan?

37:22.374 --> 37:23.975
Okay, the truck's in
an abandoned factory

37:24.009 --> 37:25.043
off Sixth Street.

37:25.076 --> 37:26.545
I'll alert
the search teams.

37:26.578 --> 37:27.446
- Wait a minute.
- What?

37:27.479 --> 37:29.381
Somebody's with it.
His name's Baker.

37:29.415 --> 37:31.049
He did time with Gerth
a while back.

37:31.082 --> 37:32.484
Here he is, Carl Baker.

37:32.518 --> 37:33.852
- Part of Gerth's crew.
- That's him.

37:33.885 --> 37:34.686
What's he supposed to do?

37:34.720 --> 37:35.887
Nothing until he hears
from Gerth.

37:35.921 --> 37:37.456
All right, let's do it.

37:46.832 --> 37:48.467
All right,
the truck's here.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.336
We're too far
to get a reading from here.

37:50.369 --> 37:51.937
- Yeah?
- There's no movement.

37:51.970 --> 37:54.640
The door's ajar, though.

37:54.673 --> 37:55.707
All right, let's do it.

37:55.741 --> 37:57.409
All units, we're good
to go here.

37:57.443 --> 37:59.378
Approach with extreme caution.

37:59.411 --> 38:01.847
Our primary objective
is to secure that truck.

38:01.880 --> 38:02.781
Everyone's got their
assignments?

38:02.814 --> 38:03.549
Roger that.

38:04.716 --> 38:07.586
All right, let's line up.

38:25.804 --> 38:28.374
Okay, on me.

38:28.407 --> 38:30.642
Three, two, one.

38:30.676 --> 38:31.943
Execute, execu...

38:31.977 --> 38:33.579
( engine revs )
Get out of the way!

38:37.649 --> 38:38.884
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

38:38.917 --> 38:41.987
( tires screech )

38:42.020 --> 38:44.790
Get your hands up! Get 'em up
where I can see 'em right now!

38:44.823 --> 38:45.957
Get your hands up!

38:45.991 --> 38:47.693
BAKER:
Get back!

38:47.726 --> 38:48.727
Get your hands up!

38:48.760 --> 38:50.429
Get back, or I'm gonna dump 'em!

38:50.462 --> 38:51.229
All right.

38:51.262 --> 38:51.897
You hear me?
I'll dump the casks.

38:51.930 --> 38:52.564
Carl, just stay
calm now.

38:52.598 --> 38:55.601
Don't tell me to calm down!

38:55.634 --> 38:57.836
DON: All right! All right!
All right! All right!

38:57.869 --> 38:59.705
Calm down,
just calm down.

38:59.738 --> 39:01.673
Stay calm! All right, all right!

39:01.707 --> 39:03.409
All right, hold, hold!

39:03.442 --> 39:04.776
Hold! Hold!
Look, hold!

39:04.810 --> 39:05.877
Everybody hold!

39:05.911 --> 39:07.713
It's just you and me, Carl.

39:07.746 --> 39:08.514
We're just going
to talk now.

39:08.547 --> 39:10.516
You're going
to let me drive out.

39:10.549 --> 39:11.783
It's not going to happen, Carl.

39:11.817 --> 39:12.451
You're gonna!

39:12.484 --> 39:13.419
Carl, it ain't gonna happen.

39:13.452 --> 39:14.753
( engine idling )
Where's Gerth?

39:14.786 --> 39:15.954
Gerth gave you up.

39:15.987 --> 39:17.088
- No.
- Yeah, Carl.

39:17.122 --> 39:19.491
- No, he didn't.
- You think about it.

39:19.525 --> 39:21.760
How else would
we be here, Carl?

39:21.793 --> 39:23.529
( grunts )

39:23.562 --> 39:25.564
You all right?

39:25.597 --> 39:26.765
( grunts )

39:26.798 --> 39:27.933
You sick, Carl?

39:27.966 --> 39:30.536
Huh? You been
throwing up?

39:30.569 --> 39:31.737
How do you know that?

39:31.770 --> 39:32.804
That's the radiation.

39:38.777 --> 39:42.047
I was feeling bad before,
but I... I feel fine now.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.114
Carl, listen to me.

39:43.148 --> 39:44.916
You're in what's called
the "Walking Ghost" phase.

39:44.950 --> 39:46.485
You're gonna get
sick again, and it's

39:46.518 --> 39:48.454
gonna kill you unless you get
immediate attention.

39:48.487 --> 39:50.756
Now, I can have a Medevac
chopper here in 20 minutes.

39:50.789 --> 39:51.823
Listen to him, Carl.

39:51.857 --> 39:53.992
This is the only chance you have
to save your life.

39:59.097 --> 40:01.533
( engine shuts off ) All right,
just take it easy now.

40:01.567 --> 40:03.602
That's it. You come out of there
and you come nice and easy.

40:03.635 --> 40:04.870
All right?
I want to see your hands.

40:04.903 --> 40:06.672
Get 'em up where
I can see 'em now.

40:06.705 --> 40:08.574
Nice and easy, Carl.
You're gonna get down

40:08.607 --> 40:09.741
on your knees, okay?

40:09.775 --> 40:11.009
Come down
onto your knees.

40:11.042 --> 40:12.177
( grunting )
All right.

40:12.210 --> 40:13.845
- Please...
- Cuff him. Let's go.

40:13.879 --> 40:14.946
Please get me
to a doctor.

40:14.980 --> 40:16.982
Okay, Carl,
we'll do that.

40:17.015 --> 40:18.884
- Please?
- All right, let's go.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.752
It's all yours.

40:20.786 --> 40:22.488
Thank you very much.

40:23.955 --> 40:25.724
DON:
I mean...

40:25.757 --> 40:26.758
it was pretty
impressive.

40:26.792 --> 40:27.859
These are three
hardcore dudes,

40:27.893 --> 40:28.694
and Charlie's up there

40:28.727 --> 40:30.629
scribbling all these
crazy equations.

40:30.662 --> 40:32.564
Crazy equa...?
Hear that, Dad?

40:32.598 --> 40:35.133
Crazy equations. Now, I did
a risk-assessment analysis

40:35.166 --> 40:36.802
based on a model
used to determine

40:36.835 --> 40:39.605
a bank's exposure
to mutual credit obligations.

40:39.638 --> 40:41.206
That's what I did.

40:41.239 --> 40:42.741
Yeah, it's a compliment. I mean,

40:42.774 --> 40:44.075
the point is
is that they bought it.

40:44.109 --> 40:45.811
Don's right. I mean,
the important thing is you're

40:45.844 --> 40:47.012
getting the truck back.
Isn't that enough?

40:47.045 --> 40:48.013
Yeah, I mean, you know,

40:48.046 --> 40:49.948
you can get an award for
a performance like that.

40:49.981 --> 40:50.949
A per...? It wasn't
a performance.

40:50.982 --> 40:52.518
It wasn't a scam.

40:52.551 --> 40:53.619
That was math.

40:53.652 --> 40:55.754
That was actual math.
I don't make this stuff up.

40:55.787 --> 40:57.255
Want to hear about math?
Here, here's math.

40:57.288 --> 40:58.790
Dinner was $92.
Divided three ways

40:58.824 --> 40:59.825
is 30 bucks apiece.
Pay up.

40:59.858 --> 41:00.992
Actually, I got
to hit an ATM.

41:01.026 --> 41:02.728
- I don't have any cash.
- Now, that's a scam.

41:02.761 --> 41:03.795
- Come on.
- Here we go.

41:03.829 --> 41:05.030
ALAN: Look, I always get stuck
with the check...

41:05.063 --> 41:06.164
CHARLIE:
What is up with your son?
