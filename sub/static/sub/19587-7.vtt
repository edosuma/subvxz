30:22.800 --> 30:25.933
Deluxe premium fork duster,

30:26.000 --> 30:28.533
sparklin' up your floors!

30:28.600 --> 30:30.400
You certainly are
a hard worker.

30:30.467 --> 30:32.267
Yes. Proverbs 28:19

30:32.333 --> 30:36.400
tells us,
"A man who works hard
has plenty of food,

30:36.467 --> 30:40.600
"but a man who
chases his fantasies
will end up in poverty."

30:41.500 --> 30:43.333
You're perspirin'.

30:46.000 --> 30:50.500
I just have to fit this
into there.

30:53.733 --> 30:55.533
It's a bit hot in here.

30:55.600 --> 30:57.467

30:57.533 --> 30:59.300
You're quite
the Bible scholar.

"Give, and it shall be
given unto you,

31:04.067 --> 31:08.867

run to your bosom."

31:15.700 --> 31:17.067
Ma'am, let me help you
with that.

31:17.100 --> 31:19.300
I got it.

31:19.367 --> 31:24.800
Look, it's just my opinion,
but you might be better suited
to another line of work.

31:29.333 --> 31:30.700
You're good at this.

31:43.333 --> 31:44.800
It's awful.

32:01.300 --> 32:03.367
I thought you said to play it
with heart, Mr. Phillips.

32:03.433 --> 32:06.633
Yeah. Now play it with balls.

32:06.700 --> 32:08.367
What do you think
this song's about, son?

32:08.433 --> 32:11.067
Well... Rockin', I guess.

32:11.133 --> 32:14.533
No! Screwin'!

32:14.600 --> 32:17.467
It's a song about screwin',
plain simple,

32:17.533 --> 32:19.467
good, old-fashion screwin'.

32:20.567 --> 32:21.767
Now, hold on a sec...

32:25.400 --> 32:26.467
Are you a virgin?

32:26.533 --> 32:27.833
Yes, sir.

32:29.133 --> 32:31.767
I mean, no, sir.

32:34.567 --> 32:36.867
Let's take five. Smoke break.

32:38.400 --> 32:39.833
Let's go talk. Come on.

32:47.533 --> 32:49.167
All right, out with it.

32:49.233 --> 32:52.567
Something's on your mind, son,
and it ain't music.

32:52.633 --> 32:54.300
What is it?

32:54.367 --> 32:56.467
Or, should I ask, who is it?

32:57.400 --> 32:59.133
Someone you're...

33:00.200 --> 33:02.867
Marion... Give us a sec.

33:05.767 --> 33:07.300
What's on your mind?

33:07.367 --> 33:10.100
See, I got this girl, Trixie.

33:10.633 --> 33:11.933
Uh-huh.

33:12.067 --> 33:14.567
Only it ain't her
you're screwin'.

33:14.633 --> 33:16.700
Sam, we're on the road,
I mean...

33:16.767 --> 33:19.600
-These girls they...
-Uh-huh.

33:19.667 --> 33:23.700
Well, life on the road
is... Complicated, Elvis.

33:25.200 --> 33:27.467
But it don't mean a thing

33:27.533 --> 33:30.200
unless you make it a thing.

33:31.500 --> 33:32.800
Understand?

33:33.333 --> 33:34.600
I guess.

33:36.067 --> 33:37.267
All I'm saying

33:40.567 --> 33:42.133
is you ain't the only one.

33:44.867 --> 33:47.200
All right.
Thank you so much...

33:48.233 --> 33:49.667
I'll see you Sunday.

33:51.667 --> 33:53.067
Hey, y'all.

33:53.133 --> 33:55.967
Becks, shouldn't you be
home resting?

33:56.067 --> 33:58.667
We're supposed to be
at the doctor's at 2:00.

33:58.733 --> 34:01.333
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

34:01.400 --> 34:02.467
Time got away from me.

34:02.533 --> 34:04.133
Say hi to Elvis and the boys.

34:04.200 --> 34:06.533
-How do, Miss Phillips?
-Hey, Elvis, how are ya?

34:06.600 --> 34:09.067
-Good. Good.
-You have fun on the road?

34:09.100 --> 34:10.700
Yes, ma'am.

34:10.767 --> 34:12.533
Must have been nice
having a motel room
all to yourself.

34:12.600 --> 34:17.367
Oh, I wouldn't know.
I bunked with Mr. Phillips
the whole time.

34:17.433 --> 34:20.467
Guys,
we should get back to work.

34:20.533 --> 34:21.733
Let's head inside.

34:31.067 --> 34:32.600
Thanks for the talk,
Mr. Phillips.

34:32.667 --> 34:35.067
Say, do you mind coming
to Macy's with me later?

34:35.100 --> 34:36.867
Help me pick out
some new clothes.

34:37.633 --> 34:39.233
Sure thing, Elvi.

34:39.300 --> 34:41.667
-All right, boys,
let's take it from the top.
-Sam.

34:43.467 --> 34:44.800
The baby's coming.

34:44.867 --> 34:46.333
Quick, Elvi, get the car.

34:46.400 --> 34:47.600
All right, come on.

34:47.667 --> 34:50.100
Move! Move!
The baby's comin'.

34:55.400 --> 34:56.600
I love you.

34:58.733 --> 35:00.100
Mrs. Presley?

35:00.167 --> 35:03.067
Hank Snow's manager,
Colonel Tom Parker, here.

35:03.067 --> 35:05.667
Saw your son play the Hayride
over in Shreveport.

35:05.733 --> 35:08.433
Quite a show.
I beg your pardon.

35:08.500 --> 35:12.067
Waiter, I ordered
the filet rare. This is...

35:13.800 --> 35:15.500
This is well done.

35:15.567 --> 35:19.200
That is not the type
of service one expects
from the Peabody Hotel.

35:20.300 --> 35:21.300
I beg your pardon.

35:22.167 --> 35:23.333
Hotels...

35:23.400 --> 35:26.067
Anyway, you have raised
a fine young man.

35:26.133 --> 35:28.733
But, I would be derelict
in my duties

35:28.800 --> 35:30.467
as a Christian gentleman

35:30.533 --> 35:32.200
if I failed to alert you

35:32.267 --> 35:34.933
to the temptations
of the road.

35:36.133 --> 35:38.567
I'd certainly be glad
to discuss

35:38.633 --> 35:40.533
how I might be of service.

35:40.600 --> 35:41.700
Say, Sunday.

35:41.767 --> 35:43.133
After church.

35:43.900 --> 35:45.200
I'll see you then.

36:11.400 --> 36:16.600
...and he said, "Man, I'm as
tuckered out as a cucumber
in a convent!"

36:18.067 --> 36:20.567
Man, you about as much fun
as pulling detention.

36:23.733 --> 36:26.700
This baby business
is exhausting.

36:26.767 --> 36:28.467
Elvis is the only thing
keeping me going.

36:28.533 --> 36:30.733
Yeah, well,
things is changing, cuz.

36:30.800 --> 36:32.833
Best be ready for it.

36:32.900 --> 36:35.767
Me, I'm gonna tell the
top dogs at BQ they'd better
step up for ol' Dewey, man.

36:35.833 --> 36:38.100
Plenty of opportunity
out there.

36:38.167 --> 36:40.733
Chaps my ass,
Bob Neal promoting shows.

36:40.800 --> 36:43.067
-It should be me.
I know.

36:43.067 --> 36:45.933
Great Googa Mooga.

36:46.067 --> 36:48.067
Dear God.

36:48.100 --> 36:51.067
That shirt is louder
than your music, son.

36:51.100 --> 36:54.800
Gals like it,
that's for sure. Hello.

36:54.867 --> 36:57.133
Well, my daddy sure won't.

36:57.200 --> 37:00.167
Oh, come on, son.
You gotta stand up
to your old man.

37:00.233 --> 37:02.600
Those britches
ain't covering his ass.

37:02.667 --> 37:04.067
Well, what do you think,
Mr. Phillips?

37:04.133 --> 37:05.867
It's $9.98
for the jacket.

37:05.933 --> 37:07.633
$6.50 for the pants.

37:07.700 --> 37:09.567
$12 for the shoes, and...

37:09.633 --> 37:12.067
Well, Mr. Bill will throw this
handkerchief in for free.

37:12.133 --> 37:15.067
Oh, it's for free, huh?

37:15.100 --> 37:17.400
You got that kind of money?

37:17.467 --> 37:19.167
Oh, well, no, sir, but...

37:19.233 --> 37:21.667
See the manager guy
backstage at the Hayride said

37:21.733 --> 37:24.067
that maybe my label
could pay for it.

37:24.133 --> 37:25.133
Did he, now?

37:27.067 --> 37:29.933
-Well, Bob is uh...
-Oh, not Mr. Neal.

37:30.067 --> 37:32.167
It was Hank Snow's manager.

37:32.233 --> 37:33.300
Colonel something.

37:35.367 --> 37:36.800
He's an awfully nice fella.

37:41.733 --> 37:43.067
I'll bet he was.

37:44.133 --> 37:46.067
Son...

37:46.100 --> 37:49.633
You're gonna meet
all kinds of nice fellas.

37:49.700 --> 37:53.067
And they ain't all gonna have
your best interest at heart.

37:54.167 --> 37:55.267
Remember that.

37:57.700 --> 37:58.933
I'll tell ya what.

38:00.133 --> 38:02.067
I'll have Lansky
put it on account.

38:03.600 --> 38:07.467
Well, poacher comin' after
the kid's a good sign.

38:07.533 --> 38:08.800
Mmm-hmm.

38:10.433 --> 38:11.733
Ta-da!

38:12.767 --> 38:14.100
Not on my account.

38:15.300 --> 38:16.367
Just the shoes, then.

38:17.267 --> 38:19.067
Agent of darkness,

38:19.633 --> 38:20.900
Satan,

38:21.900 --> 38:23.767
let me take you on.

38:25.133 --> 38:26.367
Anti-Christ.

38:27.300 --> 38:28.700
Beelzebub!

38:29.800 --> 38:31.567
Deceiver!

38:31.633 --> 38:33.433
Destroyer!

38:33.500 --> 38:35.200
Seven heads and ten horns!

38:36.767 --> 38:38.567
Right here.

38:38.633 --> 38:40.600
-Right now.
-Yell it, brother.

38:40.667 --> 38:45.067
I want you to look
Satan in the eye

38:45.133 --> 38:48.533
and tell him, "I rebuke you."

38:48.600 --> 38:49.800
"I rebuke you."

38:49.867 --> 38:52.533
"You have no power over me."

38:52.600 --> 38:54.300
Hallelujah. Amen.

38:54.367 --> 38:55.333
Hallelujah.

38:55.400 --> 38:56.967
Hallelujah.

38:57.800 --> 38:58.700
Praise the Lord.

38:58.767 --> 39:00.733
Amen.
Amen.

39:00.800 --> 39:02.133
Brother Lewis,

I need you.

40:25.833 --> 40:27.233
Baby.

40:27.300 --> 40:29.833
It's a misunderstanding.
It's not what it looks like.

40:29.900 --> 40:33.200
God may forgive you,
Jerry Lee.

40:34.833 --> 40:36.033
But I don't.

40:37.767 --> 40:39.100
I want a divorce.

40:39.833 --> 40:41.033
Peggy, no...

40:45.900 --> 40:47.300
I tried, cuz.

40:47.367 --> 40:49.900
Honestly, I tried with
everything in my heart.

40:51.233 --> 40:54.000
It's just the Lord has
other plans for me yet.

40:57.133 --> 40:59.767

for that seat in Hell,
after all.

41:00.367 --> 41:01.333
Hmm?

41:12.867 --> 41:14.500
Pumpkin.

It's black.

41:15.633 --> 41:16.833
It's jet black.

41:16.900 --> 41:17.900
Just like Tony Curtis.

41:20.467 --> 41:22.200
Don't worry, Mama.
It'll wash out.

41:27.167 --> 41:29.100
What the hell
is that smell?
Vern...

41:29.167 --> 41:31.267
Can smell it
coming up the stairs.

41:32.900 --> 41:34.067
What is this?

41:34.133 --> 41:35.833
What we got,
a beauty parlor here?

41:37.867 --> 41:40.067
And what in tarnation
is all this?

41:40.100 --> 41:43.167
Mr. Phillips bought it
for him to wear on stage.

41:43.233 --> 41:45.067
And this don't smell
rotten to you?

41:45.100 --> 41:48.300
Him tryin' to buy him off
with all these fancy duds
and whatnot?

41:48.367 --> 41:50.167
Be happy
he's gettin' some success.

41:50.233 --> 41:52.333
He's tryin' to take
advantage of the boy.

41:52.400 --> 41:54.867
I'm tryin' to
protect you, boy.
You understand that?

41:54.933 --> 41:57.100
Sounds to me like you
just tryin'
to protect yourself.

41:57.167 --> 42:00.167
Protect myself?
What's that supposed to mean?

42:00.233 --> 42:02.400
Maybe if you shook your tail
off that couch once in a while

42:02.467 --> 42:04.600
you'd see a red cent
you earned yourself!

42:06.233 --> 42:08.233
You're gonna wash
that crap outta your hair

42:08.300 --> 42:10.067
and get back to work
at Crown Electric!

42:10.133 --> 42:12.333
-Stop!
-Just 'cause you signed
some contract for me

42:12.400 --> 42:14.200
don't mean
you can tell me what to do!

42:16.100 --> 42:18.067
Damn it, Vern!

42:18.067 --> 42:20.067
-Elvis, wait.
-"Damn it, Vern"?

42:21.067 --> 42:23.067
Oh, yeah. Damn it, Vern!

43:19.467 --> 43:20.500
Sam!

43:23.367 --> 43:24.367
Sam!

43:31.167 --> 43:36.367
♪ We're gonna rock
all our blues away ♪

43:40.967 --> 43:42.333
You're about
as far from a saint

43:42.400 --> 43:44.767
as Ferriday to the moon
when it comes to women.

43:44.833 --> 43:46.067
Foolin' with my sister?

43:46.100 --> 43:47.467
Next time on Sun Records...

43:47.533 --> 43:49.767
When it comes
to this here piano...

43:49.833 --> 43:53.667
I ain't never seen
no one play like that.

43:53.733 --> 43:55.333
So glad you could make it.

43:55.400 --> 43:58.667
You'll see plenty
if Elvis signs with me,
I guarantee it.

43:58.733 --> 44:00.667
Son, this is your dream.

44:00.733 --> 44:03.200
Colonel Parker here is the one
who's gonna make that happen.

44:03.267 --> 44:05.267
Man-to-man now, Elvi,

44:05.333 --> 44:08.667
I ain't got nothin'
to worry about here now, do I?

44:09.200 --> 44:10.367
No, sir.
