at the time.

35:32.380 --> 35:33.460
Yeah, but it wasn't--

35:33.631 --> 35:38.466
And about the whole proposal,
it was a dream-come-true level of wow.

35:38.636 --> 35:43.380
But, um, things are moving
a little too fast for me.

35:47.019 --> 35:50.477
Right,
I don't know what I was thinking.

35:50.648 --> 35:53.390

and take things slow.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.650
I am so relieved to hear you say that.

35:58.781 --> 36:01.693
We just have to continue being honest
with each other.

36:01.868 --> 36:05.201

Clark, if you had a really big secret...

36:13.880 --> 36:15.495
...would you trust me with it?

36:17.800 --> 36:20.507
You're the most trustworthy person
I know.

36:21.554 --> 36:25.547
But I confessed to the whole world
that I was talking to the Blur on television.

36:25.725 --> 36:27.556
And I really meant to keep that secret.

I don't think the Blur minds, Lois.

36:30.229 --> 36:33.813
You were doing the right thing.
You were protecting him.

But that's not the point.

but I'm just afraid that my big mouth...

...is gonna wreck
our relationship one day.

How'd she die?

38:21.215 --> 38:23.046
By my hand.

38:25.469 --> 38:27.175
You killed her?

38:33.019 --> 38:35.476
She confessed
she murdered your father.

38:37.690 --> 38:41.683
She was one of the zealots who thought
he would ﬁnd a way to destroy us.

38:42.653 --> 38:44.359
She didn't deserve to die.

38:44.530 --> 38:48.864
You've gone too far just like when
you did when you sent me to see Tess.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.697
You want to become one of us.

38:52.371 --> 38:55.863
You want to live by our ways
and yet you reject them.

38:56.375 --> 38:59.412
Kal-El, when you came to us
with your powers I thought....

38:59.587 --> 39:01.999
I thought it represented hope
for all of us.

39:02.173 --> 39:06.212
But because you were too weak to do it,
I had to kill one of my own soldiers.

39:08.304 --> 39:11.262
To get justice for you.

39:15.227 --> 39:17.934
This isn't my kind of justice.

39:19.231 --> 39:23.224
In the coming days, you will see,
there is only one kind of justice.

And then you will have to decide

39:56.685 --> 39:58.971

means protecting you from yourself.

He killed Jor-El's murderer.

It was Alia.
