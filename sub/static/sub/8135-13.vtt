00:02.435 --> 00:05.097
KITT, go into surveillance mode
and get ready to roll.

00:07.741 --> 00:10.608
- Why would anyone wanna kill me?
- That's what we're hoping you'd tell us.

00:12.178 --> 00:14.669
I think we just hit
the jackpot, KITT.

00:14.748 --> 00:17.683
We are playing right
into the hands of that jackal.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.946
Michael, look out!
Look out!

00:42.709 --> 00:47.874
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight
into the dangerous world of a man...

00:47.947 --> 00:49.938
who does not exist.

00:59.959 --> 01:01.950
Michael Knight, a young loner...

01:02.028 --> 01:04.553
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent,

01:04.631 --> 01:07.657
the helpless,
the powerless,

01:07.734 --> 01:11.295
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

02:43.096 --> 02:45.826
What are you doing here?
I need a towel.

02:45.899 --> 02:47.867
Help yourself.

02:49.802 --> 02:51.793
Hey, I told you
not to go outside.

02:51.871 --> 02:54.362
How am I supposed to protect you
if you keep running away from me...

02:54.440 --> 02:56.806
every chance you get? Oh,
Michael, I was underwater.

02:56.876 --> 02:59.140
No one could see me there, no?

03:02.949 --> 03:06.180
What ever happened to those neat little
clip-on numbers I used to get when I was a kid?

03:06.252 --> 03:10.211
They were great. Yes, wait,
wait. I'll do this for you.

03:16.863 --> 03:19.593
So, you've had some experience
at this, huh?

03:19.666 --> 03:21.600
Some.

03:21.668 --> 03:23.363
Recently?

03:25.004 --> 03:27.302
Why be so secretive?
I mean,

03:27.373 --> 03:29.568
after all,
we are living together.

03:29.642 --> 03:31.633
Working together.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.906
Just trying to be friendly.

03:33.980 --> 03:37.746
After you prevent
my father's assassination,

03:37.817 --> 03:40.843
then I can tell you
all about me.

03:40.920 --> 03:43.753
And, uh, you can tell me
all about you.

03:43.823 --> 03:47.224
And we will have
a lovely time. Hmm?

03:47.293 --> 03:49.921
There.

03:49.996 --> 03:52.430
How's that?
Thank you.

03:55.168 --> 03:57.102
I feel silly.

03:57.170 --> 04:00.537
Well, you look so handsome.

04:00.607 --> 04:03.872
All the girls
will love you madly.

04:06.412 --> 04:09.279
Jealous?
Of course not.

04:09.349 --> 04:12.318
Because, uh,
at the end of the evening,

04:12.385 --> 04:14.785
you will come home
to me, right?

04:19.058 --> 04:20.992
She's dangerous.

04:32.205 --> 04:35.868
Are you ready to be briefed
before you attend this, uh, party?

04:35.942 --> 04:40.276
Rudy del Fuego hosting a bunch
of assassins isn't my idea of a party.

04:40.346 --> 04:45.283
I suppose you also find it tedious to conduct
your surveillance from a rented beach house.

04:45.351 --> 04:47.649
All expenses paid
by the Foundation, of course.

04:47.720 --> 04:50.780
And the girl too. I mean, don't forget
the beautiful girl I'm living with.

04:50.857 --> 04:52.791
Working with.

04:54.360 --> 04:56.555
What's that, KITT?
San Mirada.

04:56.629 --> 05:00.861
A militaristic state until the recent
election of President Eduardo Casafranca.

05:00.933 --> 05:03.094
Maria Elena's father?

05:03.169 --> 05:05.899
Yes, there's been a slight change.
He's arriving a day early...

05:05.972 --> 05:08.668
to attend the international
equestrian show.

05:08.741 --> 05:11.232
Then he'll continue
his appearances as scheduled,

05:11.311 --> 05:13.302
in spite of the threats
on his life.

05:15.615 --> 05:18.311
Who's that?
Your host, Rudy del Fuego.

05:18.384 --> 05:22.013
The man who had the most to lose
when Casafranca was elected.

05:22.088 --> 05:24.556
Yeah, and the most to gain
by his assassination.

05:24.624 --> 05:28.185
One thing's for sure... He's not
gonna pull the trigger himself.

05:28.261 --> 05:30.195
His kind never does.

05:30.263 --> 05:34.256
This is David Burns. An American
investor in San Mirada's emerald mines...

05:34.334 --> 05:36.427
and the most likely
coconspirator.

05:36.502 --> 05:40.666
My job is to find the hired gun.
Any ideas, KITT?

05:40.740 --> 05:43.470
Yes, I think a striped tie
would be very nice with that suit.

05:43.543 --> 05:46.103
Or perhaps a simple paisley,
don't you think?

05:48.815 --> 05:50.749
I'll park it myself.
Thanks.

05:50.817 --> 05:52.751
Hey, it's okay. I've
driven one of these before.

05:52.819 --> 05:55.617
It's been acting kind of funny,
so if you'll just point out a good spot.

05:55.688 --> 05:58.919
Whatever. Anywhere
along there will be fine.

05:58.991 --> 06:01.425
Thank you.

06:08.334 --> 06:11.303
Some guys will do anything
to save a buck.

06:12.305 --> 06:14.273
It's gonna
cost him plenty.

06:22.849 --> 06:24.783
Rudy!
Margo!

06:24.851 --> 06:26.978
I'm so glad you made it.
I thought you were out of town.

06:27.053 --> 06:30.887
- I was.
- Paul, it's so nice to see you.

06:30.957 --> 06:33.118
Welcome.

06:34.527 --> 06:36.859
Thank you very much.

06:36.929 --> 06:39.159
Here you are, my love.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.724
Hey, Marcello.
How's Nancy?

06:42.802 --> 06:45.168
Hey, Larry, you son of a gun.

06:45.238 --> 06:48.173
How long has it been?
Did you see my wife Kiki?

06:48.241 --> 06:50.801
Please go inside. Thank you
very much. Have a nice day.

07:02.789 --> 07:04.848
That's one.

07:10.363 --> 07:13.958
Hello, darling.
How have you been?

07:14.033 --> 07:16.001
Hello. Fine.
How are you?

07:16.068 --> 07:19.595
It was Rio, wasn't it?
Two years ago, last spring?

07:19.672 --> 07:22.698
Rio? You must try
Rudy's hot tub, darling.

07:22.775 --> 07:24.709
It'll bring back memories.

07:24.777 --> 07:27.268
Well, I'd love to,
but I didn't bring my swimsuit.

07:27.346 --> 07:30.179
Your swimsuit?

07:30.249 --> 07:33.446
We didn't meet in Rio,
did we?

07:33.519 --> 07:37.649
Forgive me. I didn't recognize
you with your clothes on.

07:37.723 --> 07:40.988
I mean...
Never mind.

07:41.060 --> 07:43.858
Try Rudy's hot tub anyway.

07:56.843 --> 07:59.038
Hmm. That's two.

08:04.750 --> 08:09.050
Nice seeing you.
Maurice.

08:29.575 --> 08:33.067
Sorry.
That's off-limits.

08:33.145 --> 08:35.477
Oh, somebody down there told me
this was the bathroom.

08:35.548 --> 08:38.142
Well, obviously, somebody
down there is mistaken.

08:38.217 --> 08:40.150
Why don't you try it again?

08:40.219 --> 08:43.586
Rio. Two years ago, last spring? No.

08:43.655 --> 08:45.886
There's a guy who looks
just like you. No?

08:45.958 --> 08:47.892
No.

09:04.143 --> 09:07.271
Um... Oh, it's you.

09:07.346 --> 09:09.940
- Thank you.
- For what?

09:10.016 --> 09:12.484
For the champagne, remember?

09:12.552 --> 09:16.454
Oh, the cha... Yeah, of course,
I remember. It was my pleasure.

09:16.522 --> 09:19.548
Hmm. Actually,
I'd already decided that...

09:19.625 --> 09:24.562
I had more than enough, but, well,
since you delivered it so nicely...

09:24.630 --> 09:27.292
What's your name anyway?
My name is Michael.

09:27.366 --> 09:29.800
Hey, no kidding?
They ever call you Mickey?

09:31.037 --> 09:33.301
- Never.
- It's a good thing.

09:33.372 --> 09:36.830
It could get confusing. I mean, 'cause
that's my name... Micki with an "i."

09:36.909 --> 09:40.470
I know it's a dumb name,
but it's the only one I got.

09:42.081 --> 09:44.481
What's the matter?
You all right?

09:44.550 --> 09:46.916
No, I don't feel so good.

09:46.986 --> 09:49.648
I think it was
that last glass of champagne.

09:49.722 --> 09:52.520
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. I'm a big girl now.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.618
But I think I'd better
go find someplace to lie down.

09:55.695 --> 09:57.822
All right.
You take it easy, okay?

10:40.039 --> 10:42.507
Try to get out
of this one, buddy.

10:42.575 --> 10:46.602
So, you trust this man, huh?
This Frenchman.

10:46.679 --> 10:48.977
He's the best.
Purely professional.

10:49.048 --> 10:52.142
No political
or personal axes to grind.

10:52.218 --> 10:55.210
Not like us,
huh, David?

10:55.287 --> 10:57.221
That's your business.

10:57.289 --> 10:59.689
All I care about
is protecting my investments.

10:59.759 --> 11:02.193
You seem to be doing
all right.

11:02.261 --> 11:04.729
It's all on credit.

11:04.797 --> 11:07.994
Everything I have went into
San Mirada's emerald mines...

11:08.067 --> 11:11.503
on your assurances that your
friends would remain in power there.

11:13.272 --> 11:15.763
We both have a great deal
to lose, my friend.

11:42.802 --> 11:45.293
Let's go down
and enjoy the party.

11:45.371 --> 11:48.807
There is a young lady
I want you to meet.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.438
Oh, hi.

11:55.514 --> 11:57.880
I must have fallen asleep.

11:57.950 --> 12:01.647
It's real comfy.
It's a little warm maybe, but...

12:22.475 --> 12:25.239
KITT, go in your surveillance mode
and meet me at the door.

12:46.999 --> 12:48.864
Hey, what's going on?

12:56.342 --> 12:59.038
I would have been here sooner,
but you didn't tip the valet.

13:04.884 --> 13:06.852
Car just left here, KITT,
with two guys.

13:06.919 --> 13:09.649
And a female in the backseat,
apparently unconscious.

13:09.722 --> 13:11.690
They turned right
at the end of the driveway.

13:11.757 --> 13:14.851
It's a gray Seville.

13:14.927 --> 13:18.158
- Shall we overtake them?
- No, not just yet.

13:18.230 --> 13:20.494
I wanna make sure
I know where they're headed.

13:43.589 --> 13:46.023
- So, what are we gonna do with her?
- Let's keep it simple.

13:46.091 --> 13:48.559
There's a whole ocean out there.
We might as well use it.

13:51.397 --> 13:53.695
- Grab her! She's trying to get out!
- Let go of me!

13:53.766 --> 13:55.757
Aah!

13:58.671 --> 14:01.435
- What's going on?
- They seem to be out of control.

14:01.507 --> 14:03.372
Let's go.

14:09.448 --> 14:12.611
Aah! Get the wheel!
I can't see! Stop it!

14:27.833 --> 14:30.131
Crazy broad jumped out.

14:30.202 --> 14:32.261
I'm afraid that was
your unconscious female.

14:33.339 --> 14:35.307
Let's cut 'em off.

14:39.478 --> 14:41.412
Hey, who's that guy anyway?

14:44.617 --> 14:47.085
Michael, you're
letting them get away.

14:47.152 --> 14:49.950
I know, KITT, but we gotta
make sure the girl's okay.

15:09.475 --> 15:11.602
Think it'll hold, KITT?

15:11.677 --> 15:14.237
My winch apparatus was not
designed for mountain climbing.

15:14.313 --> 15:16.247
But I'm willing to risk it
if you are.

15:47.046 --> 15:49.014
You're one lucky lady.

15:50.716 --> 15:52.650
There you go.

16:19.144 --> 16:21.635
All right, KITT.
Let's go!

16:46.305 --> 16:49.365
KITT. KITT!

16:51.677 --> 16:54.407
Michael, the pulley is overheated.
I'm cooling it now.

17:00.986 --> 17:03.614
It's ready now.
Terrific!

17:06.657 --> 17:09.525
A temporary memory loss?
You mean, she has amnesia?

17:09.595 --> 17:12.119
Not exactly.
The doctor said that sometimes...

17:12.196 --> 17:14.994
a trauma can cause
a psychological block.

17:15.067 --> 17:17.365
It's possible she could
remember a few things.

17:17.435 --> 17:19.369
I don't want her interfering
with your work.

17:19.438 --> 17:22.964
Devon, all I know is those two guys from the
party, they didn't take her for a joyride.

17:23.041 --> 17:26.307
Okay, okay,
but what if she's a spy?

17:26.377 --> 17:29.609
How can we be sure that she's not
secretly working for... for Rudy?

17:29.681 --> 17:31.876
Probably because Rudy
tried to have her killed.

17:31.950 --> 17:34.111
What I wanna do
is find out why.

17:34.186 --> 17:36.848
I don't like this.
I don't like the...

17:36.922 --> 17:40.085
We are playing right into
the hands of that jackal.

17:40.159 --> 17:42.684
Trust doesn't come too easy
for you, does it?

17:42.761 --> 17:45.286
There's no time left for trust.

17:46.532 --> 17:49.467
But you didn't check
to see if she was dead.

17:49.535 --> 17:52.003
She went over. I saw it.
When that car got in the way,

17:52.071 --> 17:54.733
well, I figured the best thing to do
was to get outta there fast.

17:54.807 --> 17:57.674
The best thing to do
is to finish the job.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.677
This wouldn't have happened
in my country.

17:59.745 --> 18:04.444
In your country, Rudy, they shoot
first and ask questions later.

18:04.516 --> 18:08.850
I want you to check the beach for
tire marks. Anything. Watch her house.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.116
If she's dead,
get rid of the body.

18:11.190 --> 18:14.819
If she's alive, I wanna know who
she talked to and what she said.

18:14.893 --> 18:18.260
Yes, sir.
Let's go.

18:21.567 --> 18:24.536
Should we tell the Frenchman
about the girl?

18:24.603 --> 18:27.868
You don't inform professionals
of that sort.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.773
You simply hire
and pay them.

18:30.843 --> 18:34.108
In that case,
I once again...

18:34.179 --> 18:37.637
put my trust in you,
David Burns.

18:37.716 --> 18:40.184
- Cheers.
- Isn't it a little early for this?

18:40.252 --> 18:43.983
Never too early to celebrate
success and friendship.

18:44.056 --> 18:47.651
Hey, lovely color...

18:47.726 --> 18:49.694
the color of money.

19:36.241 --> 19:39.438
Hey, this is useless.
We can't even get down there.

19:39.511 --> 19:42.036
So, what are we gonna do?

19:42.114 --> 19:45.481
We come back in the daylight
with a boat. Come on.

20:40.672 --> 20:43.641
¢Ü Get closer ¢Ü

20:45.244 --> 20:48.338
¢Ü Want love ¢Ü
Is this safe enough?

20:51.450 --> 20:54.851
¢Ü Hold her hand ¢Ü
That's perfect.

20:57.589 --> 21:00.990
But if we can see Rudy through these,
there's a good chance he can see us.

21:05.063 --> 21:07.088
Mm, what's that smell?

21:07.165 --> 21:09.156
Coconut oil.

21:09.234 --> 21:11.634
Makes you feel
like having a pina colada.

21:11.703 --> 21:13.637
Or something.

21:13.705 --> 21:16.970
Excuse me.
Where am I?

21:21.113 --> 21:24.105
Morning, Micki.
I'm Michael, remember?

21:24.182 --> 21:28.778
Micki?
Who's Micki?

21:28.854 --> 21:32.187
- What's going on around here?
- There was an accident yesterday,

21:32.257 --> 21:35.886
And you had
a temporary memory loss.

21:35.961 --> 21:41.126
Oh. Then, it wasn't a dream.

21:41.199 --> 21:44.327
Um, do I know you?

21:44.403 --> 21:48.601
I'm Michael Knight.
I met you at the party yesterday.

21:48.674 --> 21:52.576
Look, I don't meet guys at parties
and then go home with them.

21:55.247 --> 21:57.181
I don't think.

22:03.522 --> 22:06.013
Do you remember anything?
Anything at all?

22:06.091 --> 22:09.185
I think there were...
There were two men.

22:11.963 --> 22:15.490
I-I felt...
I felt like I was falling.

22:18.937 --> 22:21.337
I don't understand.

22:21.406 --> 22:24.534
Those two men, we think
they tried to kill you.

22:24.609 --> 22:27.009
Why would anyone wanna kill me?

22:27.079 --> 22:29.843
That's what we were hoping
you'd tell us.

22:31.316 --> 22:35.514
- Did you think of something?
- Kind of. I'm hungry.

22:38.690 --> 22:41.523
Don't worry, Micki.
We'll help you remember.

22:41.593 --> 22:45.029
Now, did you take a purse
with you to the party?

22:45.097 --> 22:47.657
Yeah. I mean, well...

22:47.733 --> 22:51.965
Well, I-I guess so. Don't
you think? Maybe I dropped it.

22:52.037 --> 22:55.200
I'll tell you what. I'll go down
to the beach and look for it, huh?

22:55.273 --> 22:57.867
If you need me,
either of you,

22:57.943 --> 23:00.776
you call me on the comlink.
Uh, Michael?

23:00.846 --> 23:03.474
- Thank you.
- That's okay.

23:03.548 --> 23:07.484
- You're a real nice lady.
- Am I?

23:10.822 --> 23:13.154
Somebody doesn't think so.

23:22.734 --> 23:26.067
Michael, there were a substantial
number of vehicles at the party last night.

23:26.138 --> 23:29.403
Doing a comparative analysis
of license plates can be very involved,

23:29.474 --> 23:32.739
sometimes as far back
as the factory where the car was made.

23:32.811 --> 23:34.938
Kinda like a family tree, huh?

23:35.013 --> 23:38.346
I hate to be the one to break this
to you, but automobiles are not human.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.749
They have no lineage
or personality.

23:40.819 --> 23:44.118
I wonder why
I keep forgetting that.

23:44.189 --> 23:47.590
You've probably begun to form
a psychological attachment to me.

23:47.659 --> 23:49.923
That would be
a logical human response.

23:51.163 --> 23:53.188
No.

23:53.265 --> 23:57.099
I think it was that '56 Chevy
I had in high school.

23:57.169 --> 23:59.797
Boy, I loved that car.

23:59.871 --> 24:03.307
Really?

24:08.013 --> 24:10.880
KITT, go into
surveillance mode, huh?

24:10.949 --> 24:13.144
- Michael?
- Yeah, KITT.

24:13.218 --> 24:16.346
Could your 1956 Chevrolet
go into surveillance mode?

24:16.421 --> 24:20.050
No, but we sure had some fun
cruising hamburger joints.

24:53.458 --> 24:55.653
Ray, we got company.

25:17.115 --> 25:19.208
You always carry a purse
when you go to the beach?

25:19.284 --> 25:21.912
Well, it keeps my suntan lotion
from melting.

25:21.987 --> 25:24.854
- See ya.
- Hold it.

25:24.923 --> 25:28.120
Sometimes it attracts
the wrong kind of people.

25:28.193 --> 25:30.127
KITT, I need help.

25:45.143 --> 25:47.407
Just give us the purse.

25:53.885 --> 25:56.877
I'm sorry.
I mean, I didn't realize, you know?

25:56.955 --> 25:59.048
It really doesn't go
with your outfit at all.

25:59.124 --> 26:01.388
It's my mother's.

26:14.406 --> 26:16.772
What the hell is that?

26:38.396 --> 26:42.833
Ray! Ray, come on! Forget that!
Let's get outta here! Come on!

26:44.035 --> 26:46.367
Michael, are you all right?
Michael?

27:24.309 --> 27:26.641
I'm afraid this is
as far as we go, Michael.

27:29.147 --> 27:31.877
Let's go back and get
what we came for.

27:31.950 --> 27:36.046
Don't worry. I'll talk to
Bonnie about adding pontoons.

27:40.558 --> 27:42.822
It doesn't make sense.

27:42.894 --> 27:45.863
I mean, nobody leaves the house
without a driver's license,

27:45.930 --> 27:48.455
some kind of I.D.

27:48.533 --> 27:51.229
What good is a key
if I don't know where it fits?

27:57.809 --> 28:03.179
I'm sorry. I don't know.
I just feel so helpless.

28:03.248 --> 28:07.947
You're all I've got. You know
what's the scariest part of all?

28:09.154 --> 28:11.987
The more time goes by,

28:12.057 --> 28:15.117
the more scared I get
that I'm not gonna remember.

28:16.661 --> 28:19.721
I promise you
I'll find out who you are.

28:19.798 --> 28:21.959
Somebody's bound to
report your disappearance.

28:24.135 --> 28:26.262
What if they don't?

28:26.337 --> 28:28.396
Then they don't know
what they're missing.

28:30.041 --> 28:32.305
You better get ready.

28:32.377 --> 28:34.743
Okay.
You hang in there.

28:47.659 --> 28:50.389
Excuse me.
No problem.

28:50.462 --> 28:53.488
Uh, actually,
I wanted a word with you.

28:53.565 --> 28:56.227
In private
if you don't mind.

28:56.301 --> 28:58.531
Why would I mind?

29:04.976 --> 29:07.672
Michael,

29:07.746 --> 29:09.907
I'm getting worried.

29:09.981 --> 29:11.915
Join the club.

29:11.983 --> 29:14.781
I'm serious.
My father arrives in one hour,

29:14.853 --> 29:19.756
and we still don't have a clue of
who could be his... His murderer.

29:19.824 --> 29:22.258
Marie Elena, we don't have
that much to work with.

29:22.327 --> 29:25.660
It... It's this thing
with Micki.

29:25.730 --> 29:28.961
I know she's a nice girl.
I know, but...

29:29.033 --> 29:30.967
it's all this time
you spend with her.

29:31.035 --> 29:34.801
Micki's memory could turn out to
be the clue. And what if it isn't?

29:34.873 --> 29:39.503
If you spend all your time on her,
maybe it's too late to help my father.

29:39.577 --> 29:43.604
I'm sorry, Michael.

29:43.681 --> 29:46.343
But you are
our only hope right now.

29:47.418 --> 29:51.787
And... And we need you.

29:53.758 --> 29:55.692
I need you.

29:56.761 --> 29:59.389
Round three.

30:02.967 --> 30:07.370
Of the seven possible assassins, my sources
have uncovered movement in three areas.

30:08.439 --> 30:12.307
Micki, you recognize
any of these pictures?

30:14.312 --> 30:16.246
Hmm.

30:17.482 --> 30:22.351
No. But this one kind of looks
like Al Pacino, don't you think?

30:26.257 --> 30:28.248
Sorry.

30:29.427 --> 30:32.055
This one is Carlos.
Somehow or other,

30:32.130 --> 30:35.099
I don't think they'd hire him
for a Latin American hit.

30:35.166 --> 30:37.760
Romeo and Juliet.

30:37.836 --> 30:41.499
- Devon, that's one picture. Are they a team?
- They're one person.

30:41.573 --> 30:45.407
No one knows if the assassin
is a man or a woman.

30:47.245 --> 30:49.839
Now, the Frenchman
is a definite possibility.

30:49.914 --> 30:52.075
The Frenchman?

30:52.150 --> 30:55.779
There was something
about a Frenchman.

30:55.854 --> 30:58.254
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

30:58.323 --> 31:01.121
I-I remember these two guys
were talking about a Frenchman.

31:01.192 --> 31:04.059
What exactly did they say?

31:05.597 --> 31:08.725
Micki, that's good. Really.
It saves us a lot of work.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.791
All we gotta do now
is find the Frenchman's aliases.

31:13.171 --> 31:16.732
- Hello.
- Hello.

31:16.808 --> 31:20.710
Joe Palmer.
I remember I'm engaged to him.

31:20.778 --> 31:23.042
You're engaged
to the Frenchman?

31:23.114 --> 31:25.776
No. I-I'm engaged to Joe Palmer.
He's my fiance.

31:25.850 --> 31:27.784
We have to find him.
He'll know who I am.

31:27.852 --> 31:29.786
Yeah, what is it?

31:29.854 --> 31:33.381
My scanners show Burns's car
is now leaving the beach house.

31:33.458 --> 31:35.449
I'll be right there.
Wait. What about me?

31:35.526 --> 31:38.654
Bonnie will show you
how to use the comlink.

31:40.965 --> 31:42.933
I'm sorry, Micki.

31:43.001 --> 31:45.697
I'm sorry.
Please, try to understand.

31:45.770 --> 31:49.672
You know,
this is so important.

31:49.741 --> 31:53.006
I understand, okay?
I understand that you have a father...

31:53.077 --> 31:55.068
and a home
and you know someone loves you.

31:55.146 --> 31:57.273
I understand perfectly.

32:10.695 --> 32:13.528
Michael, what is the purpose
of following David Burns?

32:13.598 --> 32:15.623
Instinct, KITT. Instinct.

32:15.700 --> 32:19.295
You know I can't compute instinct.
Is there anything I can do?

32:19.370 --> 32:23.966
Yeah. Promise to cruise a
hamburger joint with me someday.

32:24.042 --> 32:27.944
If we must. But meanwhile, Burns is
now three quarters of a mile up...

32:28.012 --> 32:30.344
and turning left.
Great.

32:30.415 --> 32:32.474
As long as they don't know
where we are.

32:54.105 --> 32:57.006
I think we just hit
the jackpot, KITT.

33:02.880 --> 33:04.814
Well, while we wait
for the payoff,

33:04.882 --> 33:07.976
I've had some results
on the Frenchman's aliases.

33:08.052 --> 33:10.577
I still haven't determined
which is his real name.

33:10.655 --> 33:13.419
That's okay. He probably
doesn't even remember himself.

33:15.493 --> 33:17.961
- Wow, that's great, KITT.
- Merci beaucoup.

33:18.029 --> 33:20.827
Just how many languages
do you speak now, anyway?

33:20.898 --> 33:24.925
Should I count the archaic tongues?

33:25.003 --> 33:28.871
Hi, Joe?
This is Micki.

33:28.940 --> 33:31.738
You know... Micki.

33:31.809 --> 33:34.334
You don't know.

33:34.412 --> 33:36.972
This is Joe Palmer,
isn't it?

33:38.783 --> 33:43.117
I see. Well, I'm sorry
if I bothered you.

33:43.187 --> 33:45.883
Have a nice day.

34:02.440 --> 34:06.376
KITT, do you see what I see?

34:06.444 --> 34:09.777
If you're referring to that derelict
70 meters in front of us, yes.

34:09.847 --> 34:12.145
Go in for a closer look, huh?

34:14.485 --> 34:18.114
Michael, why should that common bum
be of any concern to us?

34:18.188 --> 34:21.989
Because your average common bum
doesn't wear a Swiss watch.

34:30.201 --> 34:32.726
Shall we, as you say, take him?

34:32.804 --> 34:35.101
Not just yet.
Let's just follow him.

34:35.172 --> 34:38.266
I don't wanna blow it
till we're sure.

34:39.342 --> 34:41.902
I don't wanna report
a missing person.

34:41.978 --> 34:45.745
I wanna know
if someone else did.

34:45.817 --> 34:49.217
No, I know where she is.

34:50.588 --> 34:53.580
Look. All I wanna know...

34:53.658 --> 34:57.594
is did someone report
a missing Micki?

34:59.363 --> 35:01.422
This is not a joke.

35:01.499 --> 35:03.694
It's not even a little bit funny.

35:04.769 --> 35:06.703
Oh, forget it.

35:12.543 --> 35:16.536
Pretty big hotel, KITT.
How am I gonna find his room, huh?

35:16.614 --> 35:19.048
Well, why don't you use
your instincts, Michael?

35:19.117 --> 35:21.176
Yeah, right.

35:44.475 --> 35:47.239
Hi. Sorry to bother you,
but I locked my keys in my room.

35:47.311 --> 35:49.575
Always happens when I'm in a hurry.

35:49.647 --> 35:51.706
719.

35:55.019 --> 35:56.953
Thank you.

35:59.223 --> 36:01.214
All he cares about is hurting me...

36:01.292 --> 36:03.226
and stealing something
from Steven Brickmont.

36:03.294 --> 36:05.455
Something... that's you.

36:05.530 --> 36:07.760
You're nothing
but a piece of property.

36:07.832 --> 36:11.233
That's not true.
And by next week,

36:11.302 --> 36:14.271
I'm going to be...

36:14.338 --> 36:17.205
Mrs. Joe Palmer.
I won't allow it.

36:17.275 --> 36:19.903
I'll stop him if I can't
stop you. That's me!

36:19.977 --> 36:22.172
Look, Joe loves me
and I love him.

36:22.246 --> 36:24.476
I'm an actress.
Of course!

36:27.952 --> 36:30.853
You wouldn't know
what to do with a real man.

36:34.125 --> 36:36.355
A pretty good actress too.

37:24.842 --> 37:26.833
I lost him.

37:26.911 --> 37:30.438
Well, you're only human,
and he is one of the world's best.

37:30.514 --> 37:33.278
Yeah.

37:33.351 --> 37:36.514
What's that? The comlink.
Micki depressed the switch.

37:36.587 --> 37:38.612
- I have a message for you.
- Okay, let's hear it.

37:40.825 --> 37:43.953
Michael? It's me, Micki Bradburn.

37:44.028 --> 37:47.327
See? I remembered everything.
I'm going home. KITT?

37:47.398 --> 37:49.730
I've anticipated
your next request, Michael.

37:49.800 --> 37:52.325
There is a Micki with an "i"
Bradburn living in Santa Monica.

37:52.403 --> 37:56.669
Let's go!

38:19.430 --> 38:21.398
Welcome home.

38:30.808 --> 38:32.867
Yeah, I can keep her here
till the action dies down.

38:32.943 --> 38:35.036
Then we can tie up
the loose ends.

38:35.112 --> 38:37.046
Right.

38:37.114 --> 38:39.048
Look.

38:39.116 --> 38:41.050
I don't remember anything.

38:41.118 --> 38:44.679
I got amnesia
when I fell off the cliff. See?

38:44.755 --> 38:48.020
Amnesia? You've been
watching too many soap operas.

38:54.965 --> 38:57.991
Ladies and gentlemen,
mesdames and messieurs,

38:58.069 --> 39:02.563
welcome to the Third Los Angeles
International Equestrian Grand Prix.

39:02.640 --> 39:05.768
Our field of contestants
representing 12 nations...

39:05.843 --> 39:08.744
are now in the process
of filing onto the field...

39:08.813 --> 39:12.010
and trooping the colors
of their respective countries...

39:12.083 --> 39:15.018
prior to the national anthem...

39:15.086 --> 39:17.020
and a start
to this afternoon's competition.

39:17.088 --> 39:20.785
We are honored today
to have 44...

39:20.858 --> 39:23.520
of the world's premiere
Grand Prix horses and riders.

39:27.198 --> 39:29.029
Hope I'm not too late.

39:36.340 --> 39:39.741
Um, well, can I get you
something to drink?

39:47.485 --> 39:50.283
You're the one who needs
something to drink.

40:01.632 --> 40:04.499
Come on, we'd better go
and call for reinforcements.

40:25.156 --> 40:27.420
I understand that this is your
favorite sport, Mr. President.

40:27.491 --> 40:31.427
Actually, Maria Elena's mother
has always loved horses.

40:34.598 --> 40:38.034
I feel that it's important for
our country to be represented...

40:38.102 --> 40:40.332
in such an international event.

40:40.404 --> 40:43.635
My people will be very proud
and very happy.

40:43.707 --> 40:47.006
Well, Daddy,
it will make me very happy...

40:47.077 --> 40:50.843
if you turn around right now
and get back into that plane.

40:50.915 --> 40:55.215
What would I say when I got
back to San Mirada, daughter?

40:55.286 --> 41:00.189
No. To become a coward is as
hateful as becoming a dictator.

41:06.530 --> 41:09.294
Daddy?
Si, querida.

41:09.366 --> 41:11.459
I'm very proud of you.

41:12.570 --> 41:16.006
I am a very stubborn old man.

41:16.073 --> 41:18.871
You are my president.

41:18.943 --> 41:22.674
Is this a pep talk
before my speech?

41:22.746 --> 41:24.213
Maybe.

41:29.253 --> 41:31.915
Micki, do you remember one of
those guys trying to kill you?

41:31.989 --> 41:33.980
No.

41:34.058 --> 41:36.322
Well, sort of.
I-I think that...

41:36.393 --> 41:40.557
Well, it must have had something to do with
what I heard them say about that French guy.

41:40.631 --> 41:45.330
All right. What else
did you hear them say?

41:45.402 --> 41:49.600
Something about, uh,

41:49.673 --> 41:52.938
people watching.
People watching?

41:53.010 --> 41:57.140
A pedestrian show?
Pedestrian show?

41:57.214 --> 42:00.775
Wait a minute.
An... An equestrian show?

42:00.851 --> 42:02.785
- KITT?
- Yes, Michael.

42:02.853 --> 42:05.344
The equestrian grounds.
According to my calculations,

42:05.422 --> 42:08.220
- they're 20 miles from here.
- Let's go for it.

42:29.647 --> 42:31.581
Did you reach Devon yet?

42:31.649 --> 42:35.881
There's a great deal of activity on the
communication system there. I'm working on it.

42:49.567 --> 42:51.967
Michael, look out!
Look out!

43:19.763 --> 43:22.425
Michael, if you don't stop driving
like this, I'm gonna jump out.

43:22.499 --> 43:24.262
Again?

43:49.693 --> 43:52.560
Michael, I'm picking up a man
with a high-powered weapon.

43:55.265 --> 43:58.462
He's 50 meters straight ahead.

44:05.643 --> 44:07.838
Get him in the limo.
Let's go! Move it!

44:31.769 --> 44:34.101
Michael, be careful!

44:34.171 --> 44:37.004
Don't worry. You're
completely safe in this car.

44:37.074 --> 44:39.770
I meant the horses.
Don't scare the horses.

44:46.817 --> 44:48.512
Hang on!

45:07.938 --> 45:09.872
We can easily catch him, Michael.

45:09.940 --> 45:14.036
I know, KITT, but I don't wanna hurt
the horse. Just wanna wear him out.

46:20.677 --> 46:22.872
Take over, buddy.

46:46.103 --> 46:48.037
Yeah!

47:06.523 --> 47:09.924
Michael?
Yes, KITT.

47:09.993 --> 47:12.052
How much longer
will we be staying here?

47:12.129 --> 47:15.860
- Two days. Why?
- The sea air is very bad for my circuitry.

47:15.933 --> 47:18.868
Well, it's real good
for my, uh, my lungs.

47:18.936 --> 47:20.870
See you in two days, buddy.

47:20.938 --> 47:24.066
- Michael, you don't have enough flowers.
- What are you talking about?

47:24.141 --> 47:27.008
My sensors show Marie Elena
already has a visitor.

47:33.450 --> 47:36.112
For you. Thank you. You're so sweet.

47:36.186 --> 47:38.120
For you. Thank you. My hero.

47:38.188 --> 47:41.817
Well, anybody wanna, uh,
cruise a hamburger joint?

48:02.946 --> 48:06.973
Michael Knight, a lone crusader
in a dangerous world,

48:07.050 --> 48:10.417
the world of the Knight Rider.
