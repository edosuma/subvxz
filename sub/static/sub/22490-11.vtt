00:19.119 --> 00:20.984
It's alive!

00:40.340 --> 00:42.535
Greetings. You know,
freedom of speech...

00:42.575 --> 00:45.305
is the most valuable right
of the American people.

00:45.345 --> 00:48.109
And so, to honor
our First Amendment...

00:48.148 --> 00:50.878
I will now fart
the national anthem.

00:50.917 --> 00:53.249
I recommend you videotape
this moment...

00:53.286 --> 00:56.119
and watch it again
on the Fourth of July.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.884
Whoops! I just crapped myself.

01:02.929 --> 01:04.691
Stay in school, kids.

01:05.799 --> 01:08.768
Whoo-hoo!

01:08.802 --> 01:10.827
Whoo-hoo!

01:10.870 --> 01:13.065
Well, it's your baby, Douglas!

01:14.441 --> 01:18.775
OK. This is gonna hurt.

01:18.812 --> 01:20.109
A lot.

01:21.815 --> 01:25.512
Experiencing a twist ending
at the end of a movie can be fun.

01:25.552 --> 01:27.110
You can get in on that fun...

01:27.153 --> 01:29.678
without having to sit through
all that Hollywood crap.

01:29.722 --> 01:30.916
Enjoy.

01:36.863 --> 01:39.093
Are we still going to do it?

01:40.133 --> 01:44.126
Turn to the dark side and join me.

01:44.170 --> 01:46.195
I'll never join you!

01:46.239 --> 01:48.298
You killed my father!

01:48.341 --> 01:51.799
No, Luke. I am your father.

01:51.845 --> 01:53.972
That's not true!

01:54.013 --> 01:55.776
That's impossible!

01:55.815 --> 01:59.148
And Princess Leia is your sister.

01:59.185 --> 02:00.675
That's not true!

02:00.720 --> 02:03.154
That's... improbable.

02:03.189 --> 02:07.819
And the Empire
will be defeated by Ewoks.

02:07.861 --> 02:09.692
That's...

02:09.729 --> 02:11.492
very unlikely.

02:11.531 --> 02:13.328
And as a child...

02:13.366 --> 02:16.858
I built C-3PO.

02:16.903 --> 02:18.894
Huh?

02:18.938 --> 02:20.462
And the Force?

02:20.507 --> 02:23.738
Well, that's just microscopic bacteria
in your bloodstream...

02:23.776 --> 02:25.607
called midichlorians.

02:27.914 --> 02:31.145
Look, if you're not gonna
take this seriously, I'm out.

02:32.519 --> 02:33.986
Oh, my God!

02:34.020 --> 02:37.786
Angela's the killer,
and she was really a boy!

02:37.824 --> 02:39.257
Oh, my God!

02:39.292 --> 02:43.490
Somebody remembered this movie
and wrote a comedy sketch about it!

02:44.898 --> 02:46.365
Is anyone there?

02:46.399 --> 02:49.493
I come from a village
where we think it's 1886.

02:49.536 --> 02:51.527
I've broken our taboo
about entering the forest...

02:51.571 --> 02:54.131
to find medicine
for my fiancÃ©. Hello?

02:56.543 --> 03:00.411
That... That was a really weak twist.

03:00.446 --> 03:03.882
Yeah. Sorry about that, folks.

03:03.917 --> 03:06.784
Wasn't that great?
And as an added twist...

03:06.819 --> 03:10.346
I'm just three ducks
in a man costume.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.592
Good night, folks.

03:18.164 --> 03:19.927
Oh, that was close.

03:22.802 --> 03:24.201
She's gonna do it.

03:33.112 --> 03:35.945
Feh! You little bastard.

03:39.752 --> 03:41.947
Today marks the 13th anniversary...

03:41.988 --> 03:44.047
of the death of a true British hero.

03:44.090 --> 03:45.921
On this date in 1992...

03:45.959 --> 03:47.893
the great comedic voice
of Benny Hill...

03:47.927 --> 03:49.485
was silenced forever.

03:49.529 --> 03:52.259
We now take you back
to that somber day.

04:33.439 --> 04:36.602
Served! Served! Served!
Served! Served! Served!

04:36.643 --> 04:37.905
Served! Served!

04:37.944 --> 04:39.434
And so, each Halloween...

04:39.479 --> 04:42.141
the great pumpkin rises
out of the pumpkin patch...

04:42.181 --> 04:45.776
and gives Halloween presents
to all the girls and boys.

04:45.818 --> 04:49.686
For some reason, he's never actually
appeared to me personally.

04:49.722 --> 04:51.781
But this year will be different.

04:51.824 --> 04:54.691
Arise! Arise, O great pumpkin!

04:54.727 --> 04:56.661
Finally!

04:56.696 --> 04:59.529
Now you can give me presents.

05:02.769 --> 05:05.067
Just kick the ball,
you blockhead.

05:05.104 --> 05:08.596
But every time I try,
you just take the ball away.

05:08.641 --> 05:11.474
This time I won't.
Come on already!

05:11.511 --> 05:13.741
Maybe this time she means it.

05:13.780 --> 05:15.475
I'm going to do it.

05:15.515 --> 05:18.109
I'm going to kick the football.
This is it!

05:20.420 --> 05:23.014
That's for years
of humiliation, bitch.

05:24.257 --> 05:25.622
What the...

05:27.093 --> 05:28.458
Poor Linus.

05:28.494 --> 05:30.792
That blockhead.
Everyone's a blockhead.

05:30.830 --> 05:33.060
Blockheads,
blockheads, blockheads!

05:33.099 --> 05:37.160
Wa waa wa wa wa waa.
Wa waa waa.

05:37.203 --> 05:38.431
What did he say?

05:38.471 --> 05:41.804
Ugh! I never have any idea
what any adult says.

05:41.841 --> 05:44.605
It's always that
"Wa wa wa" crap.

05:46.446 --> 05:48.004
I thought it would be appropriate...

05:48.047 --> 05:50.379
to bury what little
they found of Linus...

05:50.416 --> 05:52.316
in his security blanket.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.286
That stupid blanket.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.311
I knew he was never
right in his head.

05:58.725 --> 06:00.886
Oh, my sweet Baboo!

06:00.927 --> 06:03.088
I can't live without him!

06:03.129 --> 06:05.723
I won't leave him! I won't!

06:05.765 --> 06:09.667
Linus! Linus! I can't!

06:09.702 --> 06:12.170
This is different from the time
we got lost in France...

06:12.205 --> 06:15.732
or when we almost drowned
during the great river raft race.

06:15.775 --> 06:18.005
I fear just having
a positive attitude...

06:18.044 --> 06:21.639
with strong Christian overtones
won't save us this time.

06:21.681 --> 06:23.706
Hold me, sir.

06:23.750 --> 06:27.709
I said "strong Christian overtones."

06:29.021 --> 06:30.716
I'm at the end of my rope, Lucy.

06:30.757 --> 06:33.453
Everyone else is dead
besides you and me.

06:33.493 --> 06:37.361
I thought being stuck as
a pre-pubescent bald kid for fifty years...

06:37.397 --> 06:38.921
couldn't get any worse.

06:38.965 --> 06:41.297
What should we do?

06:41.334 --> 06:45.532
You should let
the great pumpkin eat you.

07:03.022 --> 07:04.887
Meet the kite-eating tree...

07:04.924 --> 07:12.490
you ugly son of a bitch.

07:12.532 --> 07:14.227
It's over.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.791
It's finally over.

07:17.003 --> 07:19.028
Rest, my friends.

07:19.071 --> 07:20.561
Now you can rest.

07:45.932 --> 07:47.058
Ba-gawk!

07:47.099 --> 07:48.225
Bock.

07:51.637 --> 07:52.865
Stupid monkey.
