02:20.182 --> 02:21.808
-Hi, Darla.
-Hey.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.686
Amanda wants to know
when you're coming to see her.

02:25.437 --> 02:28.607
-Really?
-No, not really. She's not talking.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.901
I wanna know
when you're coming to see her.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.612
I'm-- I'm coming.
I'm-- I'm coming as soon as I can.

02:33.695 --> 02:37.282
Did you ask her if--
if she has Good Ma's cedar box?

02:37.366 --> 02:38.909
Or did you forget?

02:38.992 --> 02:41.870
What part of "she's not talking"
do you not understand?

02:43.121 --> 02:44.414
Yeah, I know.

02:44.498 --> 02:45.707
Okay, I'm sorry.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.043
Matter of fact, I did ask her,

02:48.126 --> 02:50.796
and for a moment, she actually
seemed to know I was in the room,

02:50.879 --> 02:53.006
so maybe she does have it.

02:53.799 --> 02:55.509
-Do you want me to bring anything?
-Yes.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.261
Some pj's.

02:57.344 --> 02:59.763
That blue jumper thing
they have her in is horrible.

02:59.847 --> 03:02.349
Oh, and bring some Oreos.
Those always seem to cheer her up.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.643
Yeah, but is she allowed
to have them? Do you know?

03:04.726 --> 03:06.979
Did you ask the doctor if she's
even allowed to have them?

03:07.062 --> 03:09.565
I don't fucking know. I haven't memorized
the loony bin rule book.

03:09.648 --> 03:12.651
Don't call it that. It's not the loony
bin. Don't call it that, Darla.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.903
Yeah, it is. Just bring the cookies.

03:14.987 --> 03:17.906
I'm sure if you ask,
Alberness will let her have them.

03:17.990 --> 03:20.909
You've been fucking
his favorite writer half your life.

03:32.421 --> 03:33.463
Hey.

03:38.927 --> 03:40.137
It's just me.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.145
Come on, Manda.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.027
You feel different.

03:59.615 --> 04:01.283
Where you going, honey?

04:12.294 --> 04:13.378
It's me.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.298
Why does your body feel so different?

04:40.822 --> 04:41.823
Hey.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.160
Chief Richards said
you had some stuff on Dooley.

04:45.244 --> 04:48.956
Yes, ma'am. His last known residence
was Calumet City, Tennessee.

04:49.039 --> 04:50.791
This is him at 22.

04:50.874 --> 04:53.919
-And why was he arrested?
-He never was.

04:54.002 --> 04:56.213
But he did serve
four years in a fruit farm.

04:56.296 --> 04:59.299
Involuntary committal, because of this.

04:59.383 --> 05:03.554
University of Georgia.
Professor's name is Bernard Walsh.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.222
-He was videotaping his lecture.
-What can we say about Scott Landon,

05:05.305 --> 05:08.183
who has never managed to write
an original sentence?

05:08.267 --> 05:10.853
Those who discover, to their dismay,

05:10.936 --> 05:16.108
that the so-called cult of Landon is
nothing but a fad, like Beanie Babies--

05:16.191 --> 05:17.901
Liar! You're a liar!

05:22.614 --> 05:24.157
The Pie of Death.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.201
Beg your pardon?

05:26.285 --> 05:28.203
It's from Relics,
one of my husband's books.

05:28.287 --> 05:34.126
The evil magician kills his enemies
with the-- with the Pie of Death.

05:34.209 --> 05:35.502
Fans love that one.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.172
I love that book.

05:39.548 --> 05:43.385
My husband had a lot of fans that weren't
exactly, you know, wired together right.

05:45.721 --> 05:47.222
He called them Deep Space Cowboys.

05:47.306 --> 05:48.891
He-- He really liked most of them.

05:51.393 --> 05:52.644
Respect!

05:54.646 --> 05:56.273
-Respect!
-Where was he committed?

05:57.107 --> 05:59.776
In a place called Tushka
in Western Pennsylvania.

06:00.527 --> 06:01.820
He didn't have any problems there.

06:01.904 --> 06:03.572
He was released cured.

06:03.655 --> 06:06.074
Well, I think they might
have made a little "mistooky" there.

06:06.909 --> 06:08.076
This one's from last year.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.455
Barbara Danton found this
on Mr. Landon's website,

06:11.538 --> 06:13.373
where fans can leave posts.

06:15.918 --> 06:21.381
All right, campers.
This is what I call my Landon wall.

06:23.050 --> 06:27.304
This is what he won
the National Book Award for. Relics.

06:27.387 --> 06:31.058
The Library of America's award
for Prophecy Dying,

06:31.808 --> 06:33.810
and the cover of Literary Digest.

06:35.229 --> 06:37.189
But the awards don't matter.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.566
The stories matter.

06:45.572 --> 06:48.784
Any person that's ever read
a Scott Landon book, his life has changed.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.369
And any person that says different,

06:51.036 --> 06:52.788
that person is a black liar.

06:54.414 --> 06:57.167
I was homeschooled.
I never had much of an education.

06:57.835 --> 07:01.505
And I never read much until Scott's books.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.218
He taught me to read.

07:07.636 --> 07:09.012
He taught me to think.

07:12.516 --> 07:14.017
He taught me to feel.

07:15.727 --> 07:18.272
He-- He shouldn't have died so young,

07:18.355 --> 07:23.485
and he should've won all the big prizes,
like the Pulitzer and the-- the Nobel one.

07:29.241 --> 07:30.868
But he died too soon.

07:33.579 --> 07:37.249
And they would still give him those awards
if they could find those other stories.

07:41.670 --> 07:42.963
Those other stories.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.051
We are all campers.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.596
We will love Scott Landon till we die.

07:50.679 --> 07:52.347
You're the only reason I'm living.

07:52.431 --> 07:55.058
Scott Landon forever. No wife.

07:55.642 --> 07:56.643
Stay single.

07:59.271 --> 08:01.481
-Holy shit.
-Yeah.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.737
At least I know what he looks like.

08:10.574 --> 08:12.326
Well, I'm gonna let you
go on with your business.

08:13.702 --> 08:14.995
I'll be right out here, okay?

09:13.637 --> 09:15.055
Oh, Amanda.

09:20.269 --> 09:21.270
Oh, my God.

09:24.940 --> 09:26.066
Bool.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.002
Oh, Amanda.

10:15.866 --> 10:19.286
"Dear Amanda.
We got here in spite of the snow.

10:20.621 --> 10:24.082
Wow, it's beautiful,
and we are the only guests.

10:25.417 --> 10:26.668
Love, Lisey."

10:49.024 --> 10:53.904
Well, I thought we'd be dead empty
all weekend. How'd you beat the snow?

10:53.987 --> 10:56.031
Yeah, it was coming down hard.

10:56.698 --> 10:58.116
Hey, you're the newlyweds.

10:58.200 --> 11:01.203
Yes. We-- We have a reservation.

11:01.286 --> 11:02.996
Looks like we might
not need it though.

11:03.080 --> 11:05.207
Yeah, slow time of year for us.

11:05.290 --> 11:09.711
Folks we did have coming canceled
'cause of the storm. All except you.

11:11.547 --> 11:14.383
Tell you what, since you have
the whole place to yourself,

11:14.466 --> 11:17.761
I'm gonna upgrade you to room 200,
the honeymoon suite.

11:17.845 --> 11:22.558
No extra charge. My wife, Mrs. Fenton,
she loves newlyweds.

11:23.725 --> 11:25.435
My wife is a fine cook.

11:25.519 --> 11:28.355
Get settled, come down
to the dining room for lunch.

11:28.856 --> 11:31.191
Driving in the storm makes folks hungry.

11:42.828 --> 11:45.706
I love you.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.792
I love you.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.402
Dessert?

12:16.320 --> 12:19.156
I've got apple cobbler.
I made it myself.

12:19.823 --> 12:20.824
Or...

12:21.700 --> 12:25.037
No, thank you. I'm so full.
I couldn't eat another thing.

12:26.830 --> 12:29.791
I believe
my husband has something for you.

12:43.138 --> 12:46.475
Little wedding present.
Local, but not bad.

12:47.184 --> 12:48.685
Wow, that's-- that's very kind.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.229
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

12:51.188 --> 12:53.815
It-- It says there are paths?

12:54.358 --> 12:57.027
Starts right around back, can't miss it.

12:57.819 --> 13:01.615
Ends in a clearing
about half a mile into the woods.

13:03.242 --> 13:06.245
There's a view. It's not half bad.

13:07.037 --> 13:08.038
Would you?

13:55.669 --> 13:56.795
Wow.

14:10.225 --> 14:11.226
Here.

14:16.106 --> 14:19.359
Winter out there, summer in here.

14:28.452 --> 14:32.623
Do you remember that night I cut myself
and you asked me if I was crazy?

14:35.000 --> 14:36.001
Yeah.

14:38.754 --> 14:39.922
I have visions.

14:43.133 --> 14:44.885
I write 'em down, people pay to read 'em.

14:46.220 --> 14:49.473
'Cause you're a writer.
That's what you do.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.391
You asked about my family.

14:54.019 --> 14:56.188
I never talk about my childhood.

14:59.107 --> 15:00.651
How bad was it?

15:04.655 --> 15:06.323
Pretty damn bad.

15:52.244 --> 15:54.288
All right, Scott,
I want you to know something.

15:54.788 --> 15:59.042
This is on you. This is not me doing this.
This is you.

16:04.631 --> 16:07.426
If you ain't taking care of him,
he ain't taking care of you.

16:07.509 --> 16:08.510
I mean...

16:11.180 --> 16:12.181
I'm sorry.

16:15.142 --> 16:16.602
I don't wanna do this.

16:17.978 --> 16:19.563
I don't wanna do this!

16:27.029 --> 16:28.197
Jump, Scooter.

16:28.864 --> 16:29.865
Jump.

16:29.948 --> 16:31.533
You don't have to, Scotty.

16:32.951 --> 16:34.286
You do have to.

16:34.369 --> 16:35.871
You fucking do have to.
You know why?

16:35.954 --> 16:39.917
Because I've seen the gone in you.
And I've seen the bad in him.

16:41.460 --> 16:44.254
And I won't have it.
I won't have it in my house.

16:44.338 --> 16:45.464
Not my house.

16:49.301 --> 16:52.346
It's in our blood. It's in
the goddamn blood. Grandpa told me.

16:54.806 --> 16:55.807
Scooter.

16:58.393 --> 16:59.728
Just try me.

17:02.314 --> 17:03.649
Don't think I won't.

17:03.732 --> 17:06.568
Go on and test me, test me.
See-- See if I'll do it.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.242
So is that enough for you or...

17:14.326 --> 17:16.118
want me do it again?

17:19.665 --> 17:21.208
You don't have to, Scotty.

17:25.462 --> 17:26.797
Take this knife.

17:27.256 --> 17:30.717
Take it!
Put it to my goddamn neck.

17:34.096 --> 17:37.349
Come on, Paul. Do it. Do it. Do it.

17:38.350 --> 17:39.643
Come on, do it.

17:41.144 --> 17:42.145
He don't have to?

17:46.066 --> 17:47.442
That's what I thought.

17:49.444 --> 17:50.821
I'm gonna bleed it out.

17:59.788 --> 18:02.708
Last chance, Scooter.
It's your last chance.

18:03.166 --> 18:05.169
Now you fucking jump, jump, jump.

18:05.252 --> 18:08.797
And you're gonna jump off that goddamn
barn if it's the last thing you do.

18:09.381 --> 18:11.884
Go ahead. Try me.
Test me. Test me, Scooter.

18:12.509 --> 18:13.510
Come on, Scooter.

18:15.721 --> 18:17.931
Scooter, you jump...

18:19.808 --> 18:23.770
or I'm gonna cut
this buggerlug right off his head.

18:25.105 --> 18:27.149
You want me to do it?
All right, no problem.

18:34.114 --> 18:36.283
Where is he?
Where's my brave boy?

18:38.535 --> 18:40.245
There he is. I found him.

18:41.413 --> 18:42.539
I did it.

18:43.457 --> 18:45.292
Of course you did it. You're a Landon.

18:45.876 --> 18:47.586
You ain't gone yet.

18:49.505 --> 18:50.797
You can go.

18:52.382 --> 18:53.675
But you ain't gone.

19:03.393 --> 19:05.896
You think I cut you
just to make him jump?

19:06.897 --> 19:08.106
I don't know, Daddy.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.442
You can do better, son.

19:11.401 --> 19:12.903
A smart boy like you.

19:15.155 --> 19:16.740
You had to let out the bad.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.326
That's right, and what do we call that?

19:20.869 --> 19:22.704
-A blood-bool.
-That's right.

19:23.622 --> 19:25.415
Because I've seen the bad in you.

19:26.542 --> 19:28.418
And I've seen the gone in him.

19:30.587 --> 19:33.173
And those who can
go sometimes stay gone.

19:34.174 --> 19:35.801
And they don't ever come back.

19:38.428 --> 19:40.597
I ain't losing him, I ain't.

19:42.391 --> 19:44.059
Daddy, he just likes to--

19:46.895 --> 19:49.898
Scooter, you've seen
the bad in him. Scooter.

19:51.692 --> 19:53.318
You've seen the bad in him.

19:54.027 --> 19:55.612
You've seen it clear as day.

19:56.280 --> 19:57.823
Y-Yes, Daddy.

20:01.660 --> 20:05.497
What's a demon?
What-- What is a demon infestation?

20:06.373 --> 20:07.583
It's the bad.

20:07.666 --> 20:09.585
I wanna hear both of you say it.
Say it now.

20:10.335 --> 20:12.504
-The bad, Daddy.
-Say it again.

20:12.588 --> 20:14.464
-The bad, Daddy.
-One more time.

20:14.548 --> 20:15.799
The bad, Daddy.

20:16.341 --> 20:18.260
Where does it come from?

20:18.343 --> 20:19.511
The other place.

20:19.595 --> 20:21.096
There's good
in that place too, Daddy.

20:21.180 --> 20:24.516
I don't give a goddamn about good.
Good takes care of itself.

20:25.225 --> 20:26.560
Bad...

20:26.643 --> 20:28.270
Bad has to be dealt with.

20:29.646 --> 20:32.941
You think I like doing it?
You think I like this?

20:34.193 --> 20:35.319
N-No, Daddy.

20:41.158 --> 20:42.284
Give me a hug.

20:44.494 --> 20:45.495
Please.

20:54.087 --> 20:57.841
You know I love you boys, you stupid boys.
I fucking love you.

21:04.056 --> 21:08.435
All right. Well, go-- go to Boolie Moon
or whatever it is you call it.

21:09.144 --> 21:10.646
Go get yourselves cleaned up.

21:11.897 --> 21:13.190
I can't no more, Daddy.

21:15.609 --> 21:17.486
What do you mean you can't?

21:19.238 --> 21:21.615
I don't know. I just can't.

21:24.743 --> 21:27.037
I-I could take him, Daddy.

21:28.455 --> 21:29.706
Oh, yeah?

21:29.790 --> 21:30.999
Yeah.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.168
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

21:33.252 --> 21:35.254
Oh, you think you're hot shit, don't you?

21:37.506 --> 21:38.507
Yeah.

21:47.224 --> 21:48.267
I think you're hot shit, too.

21:48.350 --> 21:50.936
You jumped off that building
like it was nobody's business.

21:52.396 --> 21:53.397
All right.

21:55.482 --> 21:58.026
Go on now, boys.
Go get yourselves cleaned up.

21:58.110 --> 22:00.487
I said go, go! Go, get out of here.

22:05.117 --> 22:07.369
Go get cleaned up
and don't come back until you do.

22:21.133 --> 22:23.719
It probably wasn't much of a jump at all,

22:25.095 --> 22:27.264
but it seemed like it
to an eight-year-old.

22:28.807 --> 22:30.475
At least I think I was eight.

22:31.685 --> 22:34.104
We didn't celebrate birthdays on the farm.

22:35.189 --> 22:36.857
How often was he like that?

22:38.817 --> 22:40.110
Often enough.

22:41.361 --> 22:42.946
Was it alcohol?

22:43.030 --> 22:44.031
No.

22:45.324 --> 22:47.367
Daddy hardly ever drank.

22:48.660 --> 22:49.828
It was the bad.

22:50.746 --> 22:53.123
He cut Paul to let it out.

22:54.458 --> 22:55.834
Then he cut himself.

22:57.419 --> 22:58.712
Did he cut you?

23:00.547 --> 23:01.798
Once or twice.

23:03.800 --> 23:06.428
But it wasn't the bad
he worried about with me.

23:07.638 --> 23:10.724
It was the other. He knew I could go.

23:12.267 --> 23:14.603
He was afraid I'd stay gone.

23:14.686 --> 23:16.104
I don't understand.

23:16.188 --> 23:17.606
He loved us, Lisey.

23:19.650 --> 23:21.443
And I know you understand love,

23:21.527 --> 23:25.113
because if you didn't, you would've left
me that night I cut myself on the window.

23:28.992 --> 23:31.328
We had some good times, though,
Paul and I.

23:35.707 --> 23:37.584
He made these bool hunts.

23:38.877 --> 23:40.128
I told you, didn't I?

23:40.212 --> 23:42.840
You follow the clues to get a prize.

23:44.716 --> 23:46.260
When Daddy was at work...

23:48.095 --> 23:51.598
the prize was a candy bar or a soda.

23:53.225 --> 23:55.018
We got 'em at Mulie's store.

24:28.594 --> 24:30.345
That was the best day, Lisey.

24:31.930 --> 24:33.682
The best bool hunt.

24:44.735 --> 24:46.695
It seemed like it went on forever.

24:50.365 --> 24:52.993
And knowing Daddy wasn't home for hours.

24:57.789 --> 25:00.000
And Paul was with me everywhere.

25:04.838 --> 25:06.715
To watch me have fun, sure.

25:12.471 --> 25:14.056
But also to keep me safe.

25:24.900 --> 25:26.652
I loved him so much for that.

25:31.198 --> 25:34.535
I never loved anyone that much
until I met you.

25:44.294 --> 25:45.587
Finally...

25:48.924 --> 25:51.009
it seemed like a long time.

25:54.638 --> 25:56.598
Probably wasn't long at all.

26:02.187 --> 26:03.480
Paul!

26:04.690 --> 26:06.024
Took you a while, Scotty.

26:07.359 --> 26:08.902
But you got there.

26:08.986 --> 26:10.988
It was the best bool hunt ever.

26:11.446 --> 26:13.615
Yeah. It was a good one.

26:14.616 --> 26:15.617
Wait.

26:16.451 --> 26:17.870
We have to have a host first.

26:17.953 --> 26:20.163
-A what?
-A host.

26:20.956 --> 26:22.541
We clink bottles and say a wish.

26:25.752 --> 26:27.296
What do you wish for, Scotty?

26:28.297 --> 26:31.884
I wish for the Bookmobile to come back
this summer. What do you wish for?

26:36.263 --> 26:38.348
I wish Daddy electrocuted at work.

26:39.766 --> 26:41.685
That he gets electrocuted and dies.

26:55.115 --> 26:56.700
I shouldn't have told you.

27:00.787 --> 27:03.665
Daddy said we don't unbury the dead.

27:03.749 --> 27:07.377
No, you have to tell me.
You have to tell me.

27:07.461 --> 27:11.840
You have to finish, and then I promise you
we'll never talk about it ever again.

27:18.013 --> 27:19.973
How old was Paul when he died?

27:28.649 --> 27:30.567
I loved him, Lisey.

27:30.651 --> 27:31.944
I know you did.

27:58.554 --> 28:00.097
What's going on? What's going on?

28:00.722 --> 28:03.183
What's-- What's-- What's going on?

28:03.267 --> 28:05.519
It's all right. It's all right.

28:05.602 --> 28:09.106
-Scott.
-Hey. It's all right.

28:18.949 --> 28:20.117
What is this?

28:21.785 --> 28:22.828
Where are we?

28:23.704 --> 28:25.205
Sweetheart Hill.

28:26.748 --> 28:28.208
We have to be quiet.

28:29.585 --> 28:30.711
That's enough.

28:38.302 --> 28:39.303
Lisey.

28:42.139 --> 28:43.140
Lisey.

28:45.893 --> 28:47.269
It's getting late.

28:49.396 --> 28:50.606
Let's go.

28:57.654 --> 29:00.157
So, when we talk about this trip,

29:00.240 --> 29:05.871
we can talk about how beautiful it was
and the snow.

29:07.331 --> 29:09.166
But the-- the other stuff.

29:09.249 --> 29:13.212
The stuff about your brother
and where we went, that never happened.

29:15.130 --> 29:17.049
Because I-- I can't deal with it.

30:42.759 --> 30:44.011
Amanda.

31:13.498 --> 31:16.585
Amanda, going for a walk?

31:17.252 --> 31:18.754
It's nice to see you up again.

34:20.351 --> 34:22.396
Not here. Leave it at the be--

34:23.522 --> 34:25.690
Missus,
I thought we had an agreement.

34:33.824 --> 34:37.703
Hey, Amanda.
I heard you were out walking today.

34:40.414 --> 34:42.541
What the fuck?

34:43.125 --> 34:45.377
Manda, what did you do?

34:45.460 --> 34:47.045
Manda!

34:47.129 --> 34:50.674
Nurse! Help! Nurse!

34:51.175 --> 34:53.552
We need help in here, please!

34:53.635 --> 34:56.054
What did you get your hands on?
Where are you?

34:56.138 --> 34:59.391
Jesus fucking Christ! What did she do?

34:59.474 --> 35:01.852
You're supposed to be
taking care of her, right?

35:05.564 --> 35:07.900
She could have taken her damn life!

35:07.983 --> 35:10.694
What did she get her hands on?
For fuck's sake!

35:10.777 --> 35:13.572
She's supposed to be watched!
She's a cutter!

35:13.655 --> 35:16.909
You are going down!
You are gonna get so fucked!

35:18.410 --> 35:19.661
Manda.

35:20.245 --> 35:22.748
Manda. It's okay.

35:22.831 --> 35:27.044
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, babe. I'm sorry.

35:28.045 --> 35:29.421
It's okay.

35:49.024 --> 35:50.108
Fuck.

35:54.154 --> 35:55.322
Is she awake?

35:55.989 --> 35:59.034
Yes, but still not speaking.

36:01.370 --> 36:04.248
I left the pj's and the Oreos in my car.
Would you get them?

36:04.331 --> 36:05.332
Okay.

37:25.787 --> 37:27.414
Do you know what this is?

37:34.421 --> 37:37.591
You do, don't you?

37:45.182 --> 37:46.391
Delight.

37:46.892 --> 37:48.769
It's a delight.

37:49.436 --> 37:52.606
I found it in the cedar box.

37:53.774 --> 37:58.946
I haven't seen the afghan
that it went with for a long time.

37:59.029 --> 38:02.491
I mean, I haven't seen it--
I haven't seen it since...

38:04.034 --> 38:05.536
Scott.

38:09.915 --> 38:11.291
Come back to the house.

38:12.292 --> 38:13.877
You'll freeze in here.

38:15.379 --> 38:16.380
Hey.

38:18.465 --> 38:20.133
Stop messing around.

38:23.887 --> 38:25.347
You're my bunny.

38:26.348 --> 38:27.349
Aren't you?

38:29.935 --> 38:32.020
You're my big sissa Manda-Bunny.

38:42.698 --> 38:46.118
I-- I want to come back.

38:46.201 --> 38:47.202
From where?

38:47.286 --> 38:51.415
-I-- I wanna come home.
-Okay, okay.

38:52.291 --> 38:55.586
-You know where. You know.
-No. No.

38:55.669 --> 38:58.797
No, the only place you are
is in your head.

38:58.881 --> 39:01.717
Your-- Your poor-- Your poor head.

39:01.800 --> 39:05.137
-You brought him. You bring me.
-No.

39:05.888 --> 39:08.223
No, no, no. I didn't. I didn't.

39:16.398 --> 39:18.358
I wanna go home.

39:18.442 --> 39:19.443
Be quiet.

39:19.526 --> 39:20.903
I wanna go home.

39:21.528 --> 39:22.779
I wanna go home.

39:22.863 --> 39:26.366
They're all here. The long boy.

39:29.536 --> 39:30.704
The faces.

39:31.205 --> 39:34.166
I don't care. I wanna go--

39:36.126 --> 39:37.211
Scott.

39:57.147 --> 39:58.941
You're home.

40:04.112 --> 40:05.364
Amanda.

40:07.658 --> 40:08.951
Amanda.

40:13.580 --> 40:14.581
Aman--

40:23.340 --> 40:24.883
Okay.

40:28.178 --> 40:29.179
Okay.

40:32.724 --> 40:34.351
You may think that there's a place.

40:35.519 --> 40:38.689
I know that I did because
Scott made me believe in it,

40:38.772 --> 40:41.066
but Booya Moon is not real.

40:42.818 --> 40:47.322
It's a place where Scott
and his brother pretended to go

40:47.406 --> 40:49.366
because their father abused them.

40:51.368 --> 40:54.496
You may think that you're there,
but you're not.

40:55.581 --> 40:56.582
You're not.

40:58.000 --> 40:59.710
And I can't bring you back.

41:03.338 --> 41:05.966
The only person
who can bring you back is yourself.

41:07.885 --> 41:08.969
Okay.

41:51.011 --> 41:52.012
Bool.

41:53.680 --> 41:55.140
The end.

42:10.322 --> 42:13.075
Unit three,
there's a fire on Blackstrap Road.

42:13.158 --> 42:17.246
Old McAfee place.
Barn's fully engulfed. FD's, rolling.

42:17.329 --> 42:18.539
All right. I'm on my way.

42:56.493 --> 42:57.494
Hey.

42:59.788 --> 43:01.456
I thought you said
you were going home.

43:01.540 --> 43:04.168
I was, and then I turned around.

43:04.626 --> 43:06.253
I wanted to apologize.

43:06.920 --> 43:11.466
I've been stressed and scared,
and that makes me mean.

43:11.550 --> 43:13.802
So, I'm sorry.

43:13.886 --> 43:14.970
Have you been sleeping?

43:15.053 --> 43:16.680
No, not much. You?

43:16.763 --> 43:18.223
No. Not at all.

43:19.600 --> 43:22.144
Where's your guard dog?
I didn't see him when I pulled in.

43:23.061 --> 43:26.231
Oh. Probably had a call out.

43:26.690 --> 43:30.402
I mean, Dan said that that--
that guy is most likely gone anyway.

43:30.485 --> 43:31.904
Who's Dan?

43:31.987 --> 43:33.488
Deputy Beckman.

43:33.572 --> 43:35.616
Oh. Right. Sorry.

43:36.533 --> 43:38.869
Do you want, like, an Ambien or something?

43:38.952 --> 43:40.245
-What?
-Or a Xanax?

43:40.329 --> 43:43.373
No. Why do you have those?

43:43.457 --> 43:44.917
Because they help me sleep.

44:27.960 --> 44:30.629
Oh, no, you don't.

44:33.841 --> 44:37.594
When this pack is gone, I quit. Again.

44:37.678 --> 44:40.347
Okay, well,
just to help you quit sooner...

44:47.938 --> 44:49.398
I'm on a bool hunt.

44:51.149 --> 44:52.568
Grief is a bool hunt.

44:54.570 --> 44:55.863
What's a bool hunt?

44:59.908 --> 45:01.451
It's a game.

45:01.535 --> 45:05.289
It's a game that Scott and his brother
made up. It's like a scavenger hunt.

45:05.372 --> 45:10.752
When they were kids,
the prize was a candy bar or a soda.

45:11.336 --> 45:16.049
But my prize is learning how to be alone.

45:19.094 --> 45:21.096
Which is not much of a prize.

45:27.060 --> 45:28.645
I know. I know.

45:29.605 --> 45:33.150
I know what's wrong with Amanda.
I know what it is.

45:34.193 --> 45:35.986
It has to do with Scott.

45:36.069 --> 45:39.823
He's gone, but his influence isn't,

45:39.907 --> 45:43.827
because people keep visiting the worlds
that he's created.

45:45.329 --> 45:47.748
But it really is just--
it's just one world.

45:47.831 --> 45:50.209
It's the world that
he and his brother made up.

45:50.751 --> 45:55.547
And it's so strong that
I even believed in it. I believed in it.

45:55.631 --> 45:59.009
That's how strong it is.
And that's how strong his imagination is.

45:59.092 --> 46:02.513
I just-- I-- I can't follow you.
I'm-- I'm sorry.

46:02.596 --> 46:05.015
Forget it. It's okay.
Forget it. Never mind.

46:07.476 --> 46:08.560
Do you want some supper?

46:09.353 --> 46:10.395
What you got?

46:11.438 --> 46:14.983
I have a pound of ground chuck
and some Hamburger Helper.

46:15.067 --> 46:19.029
Wow. First wine, then cigarettes,
now Hamburger Helper.

46:19.655 --> 46:21.698
That's what Dandy Dave would've called...

46:21.782 --> 46:24.117
Eating nasty.

46:49.351 --> 46:52.187
Last one. Then we quit.

46:55.190 --> 46:57.234
In the books it's Banella.

46:58.026 --> 47:00.988
He probably thought that
Booya Moon was too childish.

47:01.071 --> 47:04.032
Which makes sense
because it was invented by children.

47:04.741 --> 47:05.742
Banella.

47:06.618 --> 47:12.082
Home of the healing waters where
Captain Black hid out in Empty Devils.

47:13.959 --> 47:18.380
Did you think I hadn't read his books?
I read them all. They're okay.

47:20.924 --> 47:25.220
And the pool didn't just heal,
it had the power to fascinate.

47:26.013 --> 47:28.056
And don't forget the monster guardian.

47:29.725 --> 47:31.476
It's very close, honey.

47:34.271 --> 47:35.856
There's many faces.

47:38.942 --> 47:40.068
And many mouths.

47:41.612 --> 47:42.863
All hungry.

47:47.117 --> 47:49.828
Please tell me you really
didn't believe any of that crap,

47:49.912 --> 47:51.455
even for a second.

47:51.538 --> 47:53.624
I mean, you were always the practical one.

48:17.648 --> 48:19.191
Where'd you go?

48:22.986 --> 48:24.863
-What?
-Nothing.

49:17.249 --> 49:19.418
-Did you get her gun?
-What gun?

49:20.127 --> 49:22.671
Amanda. Didn't you say she had a .22?

49:22.754 --> 49:24.673
Oh, shit. Yeah. I forgot.

49:24.756 --> 49:26.508
Well, she shouldn't have it
when she gets home.

49:26.592 --> 49:27.593
If she gets home.

50:13.722 --> 50:16.558
I said that I thought that he did.
I don't know.

50:18.477 --> 50:21.063
I gotta get to work.
I have so much stuff to do in there.

50:21.146 --> 50:23.190
I wanna take an inventory of his files.

50:23.273 --> 50:26.276
And I think he's even got novels in there
that he's never finished.

50:28.028 --> 50:29.363
Hey.

50:29.446 --> 50:33.992
-If you find more cigarettes, toss 'em.
-Bye.
