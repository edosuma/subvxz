I have just the thing

you're going to use

the acid in tomato juice gets
rid of the skunk smell.

I'm sorry, rodent,
but, I don't think
that's going to cut it.

It is a commonly known
fact that tomato juice is
simply an abrasive agent.

07:20.374 --> 07:22.943
But, if you really
want to rub away
the odiferous molecules,

07:23.010 --> 07:25.545
you need something
with more density.
