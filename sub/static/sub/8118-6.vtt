00:02.560 --> 00:09.880
This programme contains
strong language

00:11.400 --> 00:15.680
Ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to Mrs Brown's Boys!

00:15.680 --> 00:18.200
# She's Mrs Brown

00:18.200 --> 00:21.240
# That's Mrs Brown

00:21.240 --> 00:23.960
# Our Mrs Brown. #

00:29.880 --> 00:32.880
Come along, Granddad. Hello?

00:36.080 --> 00:38.520
All right, Granddad,
you take your time now.

00:39.520 --> 00:41.760
Are you too warm?

00:41.760 --> 00:43.280
Yes.

00:43.280 --> 00:46.760
Right then, let's get this jacket
and jumper off.

01:30.520 --> 01:33.040
Ah, that's better!

01:41.880 --> 01:43.320
Na!

01:43.320 --> 01:45.280
Morning Mrs Brown.

01:50.800 --> 01:52.000
Good morning, Lord.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.840
Are you all right?

01:54.840 --> 01:56.520
Just struggling a bit!

01:58.760 --> 02:06.280
Lift your left arm. A bit more.
That's it. Now lean forward.

02:09.720 --> 02:10.800
Now the other arm.

02:13.640 --> 02:14.840
Lean forward a bit more.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.480
Did you want something, Lord?

02:23.480 --> 02:26.120
No, just bringing Granddad home.

02:26.120 --> 02:29.800
Well, it's about fecking time.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.760
I mean, the Lord's will be done.

02:31.760 --> 02:33.400
I'll be with YOU in a minute!

02:35.480 --> 02:37.880
But I-I've barely lived.

02:39.120 --> 02:40.920
Show a shred of human decency!

02:41.920 --> 02:43.000
Mammy?

02:43.000 --> 02:45.160
Don't interrupt the fecking picture!

02:47.160 --> 02:49.400
Please, please, let me stay a little
longer.

02:49.400 --> 02:52.120
Please. Please!

02:52.120 --> 02:54.120
Hello, Father Quinn.

02:54.120 --> 02:56.280
Hello, Cathy.

02:57.640 --> 02:58.720
Shit!

02:58.720 --> 03:00.400
There's shit on the floor! Shit!

03:03.840 --> 03:05.640
Let me get that, Father.

03:05.640 --> 03:08.640
Come on, Granddad,
let's get you upstairs for a nap.

03:10.760 --> 03:13.000
I'm just dropping Granddad
back from the funeral.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.280
Why? What did he do?

03:14.280 --> 03:16.760
Granddad?
Well, he didn't do anything.

03:16.760 --> 03:19.480
I was passing here anyway
so I just thought I'd drop him off.

03:19.480 --> 03:22.120
Ah right, well you probably
 haven't time for a cuppa.

03:22.120 --> 03:23.520
No, thank you.

03:23.520 --> 03:26.000
No, I've got this!

03:26.000 --> 03:29.120
Father Quinn! Drinking during
the day? Are you all right?

03:29.120 --> 03:31.320
No, Mrs Brown, I am not all right!

03:31.320 --> 03:33.880
Father, I didn't say sit down.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.720
I just buried Mr Jones this morning.

03:36.720 --> 03:40.880
I promised him heaven
but what if there is no heaven?

03:40.880 --> 03:42.640
He's just buried?

03:42.640 --> 03:45.800
I wouldn't worry about him
coming back to complain, Father!

03:45.800 --> 03:48.120
Mrs Brown, I'm losing my faith.

03:48.120 --> 03:50.640
You're about to lose your fecking
hand now if you don't let go!

03:51.640 --> 03:55.080
I'm sorry, Mrs Brown.
I'm just afraid.

03:55.080 --> 03:56.640
Soon I won't have a flock!

03:56.640 --> 04:01.000
I don't think you're allowed, Father.
I think it's against the rules.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.840
Mrs Brown, have they called here?
Have they?

04:02.840 --> 04:03.960
Who? Have who called?

04:03.960 --> 04:06.880
The Missionaries, from the
Church of Latter Day Saints.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.400
Nobody's called here, Father.

04:08.400 --> 04:12.400
You know, they have converted four
families in the last six months.

04:12.400 --> 04:15.240
Well, wait a minute, Father,
these missionaries,

04:15.240 --> 04:17.800
do they believe in God? Well, Yes.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.280
Well, then what's the problem?

04:19.280 --> 04:22.880
We're all on the same bus, who gives
a shite who the driver is?

04:22.880 --> 04:24.280
I give a shite!

04:24.280 --> 04:27.320
Father, you watch your fucking
language in this house!

04:29.640 --> 04:33.760
Now, Father, look, what you need
to do, you need to get into your car

04:33.760 --> 04:35.040
and drive home!

04:35.040 --> 04:37.280
Father, these things
are sent to test us.

04:37.280 --> 04:38.400
Do you think so? Oh, yes!

04:38.400 --> 04:42.880
Come on. Now look, Father,
what you need to do is,

04:42.880 --> 04:45.280
well, just keep the faith.

04:45.280 --> 04:46.680
The faith! The faith!

04:46.680 --> 04:47.880
Yes, the faith.

04:48.880 --> 04:50.800
But, just in case, drive carefully.

04:52.920 --> 04:55.400
Father, would you not be better
in the front seat?

05:00.920 --> 05:03.800
Well, my God, what do you
make of that?

05:07.320 --> 05:09.480
I suppose it's hard
for religion nowadays.

05:11.520 --> 05:13.320
The older generations are dying off

05:13.320 --> 05:17.240
and the youngsters just don't seem
to have any fecking interest.

05:21.480 --> 05:24.440
It's hard for God to compete
with, you know,

05:24.440 --> 05:26.440
fecking World Of Warcraft!

05:29.440 --> 05:31.680
Would anybody hear
God's message nowadays

05:31.680 --> 05:33.480
unless he sends it by fecking text!

05:38.520 --> 05:41.160
It was Father Quinn who helped my
son, Trevor, when he wanted

05:41.160 --> 05:42.960
to go away on the missions.

05:42.960 --> 05:44.720
He's in Africa now.

05:44.720 --> 05:45.880
Oh, the Chinese love him!

05:47.760 --> 05:50.120
Father Quinn looked awful!

05:50.120 --> 05:52.360
He thinks he's losing his faith.

05:52.360 --> 05:54.960
I think he's losing
his booking marbles!

06:02.840 --> 06:04.320
Knob fell off,

06:04.320 --> 06:06.600
just like me husband!

06:09.760 --> 06:11.680
Hiya, Mammy!

06:11.680 --> 06:14.720
Jesus, you're not talking as well!

06:14.720 --> 06:17.400
Oh, hello, love, do you want
a cup of tea?

06:17.400 --> 06:18.720
Yes, please! What's up?

06:18.720 --> 06:20.320
CRASHING

06:20.320 --> 06:22.800
Ken's after knocking the fucking
wall down again.

06:30.720 --> 06:34.080
Oh, the fecking washing machine's
clapped out!

06:34.080 --> 06:36.320
I'll have to get Mark down
to look at it.

06:36.320 --> 06:39.000
All Granddad's clothes
are stuck in it.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.560
Granddad, you'll have to wait!

06:40.560 --> 06:43.040
No, not there.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.640
Come on, up to your room and play
with your yo-yo.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.000
He lost the string,
it's only a YO now!

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
I won't be home later, Mammy.
I'm meeting Mick.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.600
Oh, Mick has been around longer
than any other boyfriend, Cathy.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.640
You like him, don't you?
You like him a lot!

06:58.640 --> 07:02.400
Could be the one! A Brown dating
a policeman! Who'd have thought?

07:02.400 --> 07:04.480
Good for you!

07:04.480 --> 07:07.120
Is there tea going?

07:07.120 --> 07:09.280
Ah, here's the newlyweds!

07:09.280 --> 07:11.680
Do you want tea? 
No, I'm late for work.

07:14.120 --> 07:15.520
Goodbye, chicken!

07:17.520 --> 07:19.880
You look like you could have stayed
in bed a bit longer.

07:19.880 --> 07:22.400
Yeah, restless night!

07:23.520 --> 07:26.520
I'll head off.
I'll get a coffee in town.

07:26.520 --> 07:27.840
See yous!

07:27.840 --> 07:30.080
Now, love.

07:31.120 --> 07:33.880
Winnie must be happy with Jacko
coming home from the hospital.

07:33.880 --> 07:35.520
I'll believe it when I see it.

07:35.520 --> 07:38.600
He's definitely coming home today.
I saw it on the discharge order.

07:38.600 --> 07:40.640
We'll see. Are you all right, Maria?

07:41.720 --> 07:43.000
I'm fine.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.480
Are you still upset about last night?

07:45.480 --> 07:46.400
Last night?

07:46.400 --> 07:50.680
I heard you and Dermot arguing.
I wasn't listening on purpose,
just it was so warm, I thought

07:50.680 --> 07:52.000
I'd sleep on the landing.

07:55.480 --> 07:57.480
I worry about you, that's all.
I just worry.

07:57.480 --> 08:00.200
Look, we have to get our own place.
I know, I heard.

08:01.480 --> 08:04.640
But Dermot won't even come
and look at flats with me

08:04.640 --> 08:06.120
and we can't stay here forever!

08:06.120 --> 08:07.640
You don't hear me complaining.

08:07.640 --> 08:11.480
I know, Mrs Brown,
but a place of our own!

08:11.480 --> 08:12.880
I know, love.

08:12.880 --> 08:16.000
There's barely enough room for
the four of you, never mind us.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.280
Agnes, love. Oh, Jesus
phone an ambulance, pet!

08:19.280 --> 08:20.640
What's wrong, Winnie?

08:20.640 --> 08:23.400
I was getting Jacko out of the taxi
from the hospital

08:23.400 --> 08:26.120
and Father Quinn's after driving
over him!

08:26.120 --> 08:27.920
Jesus!

08:27.920 --> 08:30.160
Winnie! Winnie!

08:46.520 --> 08:48.840
Get you lads a drink?

08:48.840 --> 08:50.360
Eh, no thank you, officer!

08:55.720 --> 08:57.520
They must have something on.

08:57.520 --> 08:58.560
I hope not!

09:00.160 --> 09:02.440
SHE BURPS

09:02.440 --> 09:03.480
Excuse me, Winnie.

09:04.600 --> 09:05.640
A broken leg.

09:05.640 --> 09:08.800
How many times has Jacko broke
his leg?

09:10.160 --> 09:11.320
Eight.

09:11.320 --> 09:13.840
But the other one was only five. Oh!

09:14.680 --> 09:17.800
A broken leg and a few bruises.
I suppose he was lucky!

09:17.800 --> 09:20.440
Well, that's how I always think
of him. Lucky Jacko(!)

09:25.400 --> 09:29.000
Father Quinn didn't come
out of it well. No?

09:29.000 --> 09:30.920
No, he's in a bad way, Winnie.

09:30.920 --> 09:32.280
He's losing his faith!

09:32.280 --> 09:34.280
Where did he lose his faith?
I don't know.

09:34.280 --> 09:38.280
He was talking about not having
a flock. I was embarrassed. Oh, yeah!

09:38.280 --> 09:41.400
I didn't ask any questions. Mr Foley!

09:42.680 --> 09:44.360
Thank you.

09:44.360 --> 09:47.520
He's worried about missionaries
pushing another religion there.

09:47.520 --> 09:50.160
Ah! What he needs is a miracle!

09:50.160 --> 09:52.760
Maybe you're right. Yeah!

09:52.760 --> 09:54.280
Why don't you do a miracle? What?

09:54.280 --> 09:56.520
Get up and pay
for that booking round.

09:56.520 --> 09:58.280
Ah, very funny(!)

10:08.880 --> 10:11.000
I have to get that
washing machine fixed!

10:12.360 --> 10:14.960
Ah, good girl, Winnie! 
There you go, Pet!

10:14.960 --> 10:17.640
I hope you got me fresh ice now,
not that fecking frozen stuff!

10:18.920 --> 10:20.160
That's all they had, Agnes!

10:20.160 --> 10:22.840
Ah, feck off, Agnes!

10:22.840 --> 10:25.840
I swear to God, Winnie,
you'd swallow an anchor!

10:25.840 --> 10:29.360
Do you know, we could get
Father Quinn to Lourdes

10:29.360 --> 10:32.840
and hope for a miracle!
I've seen a miracle in Lourdes once.

10:32.840 --> 10:36.160
Did you? There was a man
in a wheelchair. Yeah.

10:36.160 --> 10:38.080
Then they pushed him into the water

10:38.080 --> 10:41.520
and suddenly all the lights got
brighter, all the candles flickered.

10:41.520 --> 10:43.080
You could feel a chill

10:43.080 --> 10:45.480
and then they pushed him out
the other side.

10:45.480 --> 10:47.080
And he got up and walked? No.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.480
But the wheelchair had two new tyres!

10:53.760 --> 10:55.240
It's a doddle, Dermot.

10:55.240 --> 10:57.720
The house is empty
and they have a warehouse.

10:57.720 --> 11:00.480
I could do with some money
to get us a place.

11:00.480 --> 11:03.680
But I promised Maria that I'd never
burgle a house again.

11:03.680 --> 11:05.760
Fair enough, we'll just do
the warehouse.

11:07.600 --> 11:11.000
OK, I'll take a look.
Now, no promises. Just a look!

11:11.000 --> 11:12.920
Ah, brilliant!

11:12.920 --> 11:18.160
You've a marvellous
pair of hands, son.
Gifted, gifted like Jockey Wilson!

11:18.840 --> 11:22.440
Yeah, Ma, listen. I don't think
I'll get this fixed today.

11:22.440 --> 11:24.520
Ah, you're fecking useless!

11:24.520 --> 11:26.680
Switch off the power,
Ma, for a minute.

11:26.680 --> 11:28.480
Power going off!

11:28.480 --> 11:30.040
OK, Mammy!

11:30.040 --> 11:31.920
KNOCKING

11:31.920 --> 11:34.240
What do you want, Granddad? 
Has the power gone off?

11:34.240 --> 11:35.520
No, you've gone blind!

11:37.040 --> 11:39.880
They have a top-of-the-range
security system. What kind?

11:39.880 --> 11:42.720
The Mercury infra-red scan!
No bother.

11:42.720 --> 11:45.440
Just give me a mirror and a bit
of Blu-Tack and that's done!

11:45.440 --> 11:47.360
And they have cameras,
five of them,

11:47.360 --> 11:49.880
two of them night vision.
Power coming back on!

11:53.600 --> 11:55.000
And we can silence the alarms.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.400
We can silence the bell
with a bit of putty.

11:59.960 --> 12:03.560
So then Tom Cruise comes out
of the roof with a bit of rope

12:03.560 --> 12:07.360
and a torch in his mouth
and he sets off all the alarms.

12:07.360 --> 12:11.440
HE HUMS MISSION IMPOSSIBLE TUNE

12:13.280 --> 12:16.640
Ah, Dermo, it's a brilliant movie,
you have to get it on DVD!

12:16.640 --> 12:19.240
Hello, Cathy! Hello, officer!

12:19.240 --> 12:20.440
Right, listen. I'm off!

12:20.440 --> 12:22.800
Do you fancy a drink, Dermo?

12:33.520 --> 12:35.120
Hello, son.

12:35.120 --> 12:37.080
Granddad? You still awake? Yeah!

12:38.560 --> 12:40.800
Were you at George Mumford's
funeral? Yeah!

12:40.800 --> 12:42.400
Good craic afterwards? Yeah!

12:42.400 --> 12:45.000
Were they all saying
what a nice man he was? Yeah!

12:45.000 --> 12:47.880
He must have been a good soul, so.
He was a shit!

12:48.880 --> 12:51.760
Some of us are trying
to sleep up here.

12:51.760 --> 12:56.560
Why don't yous get together and come
up and scream in me fecking ear!

12:56.560 --> 12:59.880
What are yous doing up at this hour
of the night?

12:59.880 --> 13:01.640
Talking, Ma, just talking.

13:01.640 --> 13:04.280
I sat up till after midnight waiting
for that thing

13:04.280 --> 13:06.880
to start on the fecking telly.

13:06.880 --> 13:07.920
Grand Prix.

13:11.520 --> 13:12.640
Wasted my time.

13:14.080 --> 13:16.960
It was all about fecking racing cars!

13:17.720 --> 13:22.000
Granddad was just telling me how
everyone was saying nice things

13:22.000 --> 13:25.280
about George Mumford at the wake.
That's nice. You hated him.

13:25.280 --> 13:27.560
Ah, he was a shit, nobody liked him!

13:27.560 --> 13:32.000
Ah, but still! Still what?
Yous all make me sick! Do we?

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
And what nice things will
people say about me at my funeral?

13:35.000 --> 13:36.520
Yes, if they both turn up!

13:38.080 --> 13:40.640
And I won't be around
to hear them say it!

13:40.640 --> 13:44.000
That's the way it goes, Granddad
Once you die, you go deaf!

13:44.000 --> 13:46.760
A man should be allowed to attend
his own funeral.

13:46.760 --> 13:49.840
That's a great one.
I think that'll catch on(!)

13:51.040 --> 13:52.400
He could, you know.

13:52.400 --> 13:56.280
Of course he could! I do forget
we're related to fecking Lazarus!

13:57.880 --> 14:01.280
How would a man do that now, be at
his own funeral, explain that to me!

14:01.280 --> 14:04.400
We could just tell everyone
he's dead, have a pretend funeral,

14:04.400 --> 14:06.360
let Granddad hear what's being said.

14:06.360 --> 14:09.360
A pretend funeral? What's going on?
You're just in time.

14:09.360 --> 14:12.160
Welcome to the Twilight Zone!
Wait till you hear this.

14:12.160 --> 14:17.040
Come on, Brains Trust, tell them your
big plan. Come on, Alfred Pitchfork!

14:18.720 --> 14:22.280
Granddad wants to hear all the nice
things said about him
at his funeral.

14:22.280 --> 14:25.120
At his OWN funeral now!
His own fecking funeral!

14:25.120 --> 14:30.000
So I suggested we have
a pretend funeral, and let Granddad,
you know, hear them!

14:30.000 --> 14:31.160
That might work!

14:33.760 --> 14:36.560
That could be great fun.
I could be real sad.

14:40.720 --> 14:43.880
Am I the only sane person
in this fecking house?

14:45.120 --> 14:49.880
A pretend funeral! I haven't been
in mourning since your father died.

14:49.880 --> 14:52.760
Everyone said I looked lovely
in that black dress.

14:52.760 --> 14:54.520
I still have it. Have you, Mammy?

14:54.520 --> 14:58.680
Oh, yes. You know,
in case of, erm...

14:58.680 --> 14:59.760
a special occasion.

15:01.560 --> 15:05.560
No, no, we'd never get away with it.
We would, Ma!

15:05.560 --> 15:08.800
I know a couple of lads,
undertakers.
They'd lend me a coffin.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.400
We could lay him out in the house.

15:10.400 --> 15:14.880
I could do his hair and make-up
like in funeral parlours. 
Father Quinn could say prayers.

15:14.880 --> 15:18.000
That might be the last thing
he does as a priest!

15:18.000 --> 15:23.160
And we could all have a flower
to drop on the coffin
as it's going down the hole.

15:24.520 --> 15:27.760
Easy, Ma! We're not going that far.
Fecking spoilsport!

15:30.960 --> 15:34.440
We could always say nothing
and just cremate him?

15:35.920 --> 15:37.920
He'll think he was in Torremolinos!

15:39.560 --> 15:43.680
When? When will we do it?
No, not Monday - bingo.

15:43.680 --> 15:45.560
Not Wednesday - pilates.

15:45.560 --> 15:48.360
Not Thursday - my training course.
It can't be Tuesday.

15:48.360 --> 15:51.400
Are yous all too busy
to let me die?

15:51.400 --> 15:54.240
Shut up, you,
and wait your fecking turn!

15:54.240 --> 15:56.920
You wouldn't die last month
when I asked you to.

15:56.920 --> 16:00.920
Hold on, nobody mentioned Friday.
How's Friday?

16:00.920 --> 16:03.600
If we do this, we don't tell anybody,
only family.

16:03.600 --> 16:07.160
And certainly not Winnie.
You know what she's fecking like!

16:07.160 --> 16:10.720
Oh, wait now,
we'd better ask the corpse.

16:10.720 --> 16:13.240
Granddad, how would you like
to die on Friday?

16:13.240 --> 16:17.960
Friday is grand!
Friday it is, then!

16:25.200 --> 16:30.160
Dermot! Dermot, you watch your time -
you don't want to be late for work!

16:30.160 --> 16:32.600
OK, Mammy. Just getting my costume.

16:32.600 --> 16:36.080
DOOR BELL RINGS

16:36.080 --> 16:39.760
Mammy, that might be the lads
with the coffin. Oh, right!

16:42.200 --> 16:43.440
Hello, ma'am!

16:43.440 --> 16:47.040
Come in, come in. Come in, quick!
Don't let anybody see you!

16:47.040 --> 16:48.280
Thank you, ma'am.

16:51.840 --> 16:54.920
I've been expecting you! Excellent.

16:54.920 --> 16:57.240
We are here to shine a light
on the path to God,

16:57.240 --> 17:00.240
and, may I just say, we
are delighted with such a welcome.

17:04.600 --> 17:07.560
Ah, that's very nice.
Have you got it with you now?

17:07.560 --> 17:09.000
I'm sorry, have we got what?

17:09.000 --> 17:11.320
The coffin -
is it out in the big black car?

17:11.320 --> 17:14.440
Uh, we walked here. You walked?!

17:14.440 --> 17:16.960
You didn't carry it
up the fecking road?!

17:16.960 --> 17:19.480
It's supposed to be a surprise!

17:21.560 --> 17:23.320
Ma'am, we may be confusing you.

17:23.320 --> 17:26.240
I'm Elder Bush and this here
is Elder Peach. Howdy, ma'am!

17:26.240 --> 17:30.040
Are you the undertakers?
No, ma'am! We're Mormons.

17:30.040 --> 17:33.520
Oh, son,
don't be putting yourself down.

17:33.520 --> 17:36.920
They used to say that about my child
in school, but he turned out fine.

17:36.920 --> 17:41.440
No, ma'am - Mormons, from
the Church of Latter-day Saints.

17:41.440 --> 17:42.520
The Church...?

17:43.920 --> 17:46.440
You're the two that Father...

17:46.440 --> 17:48.840
How do, do, do!

17:48.840 --> 17:50.400
Do sit down!

17:50.400 --> 17:52.120
Why, thank you, Ma'am, how kind!

17:52.120 --> 17:53.880
Not at all!

17:53.880 --> 17:56.840
I want to find out what
all the fecking fuss is about!

17:56.840 --> 17:59.520
A lovely home you have here.
Thank you very much, son.

17:59.520 --> 18:03.160
Well, we're just a normal family,
trying to get by. Hello, sir!

18:03.160 --> 18:04.920
Oh, don't mind him,

18:04.920 --> 18:08.720
he's just excited about
his funeral tomorrow.

18:11.640 --> 18:14.480
Well, my name is Agnes, or Mrs Brown,

18:14.480 --> 18:18.200
whichever you think is most
appropriate. That's fine, Mrs Brown.

18:18.200 --> 18:20.520
May we begin with a few moments
of silent prayer?

18:20.520 --> 18:21.920
Ha ha ha!

18:23.200 --> 18:24.480
Seriously?

18:27.000 --> 18:29.760
All right, just keep
your voices down.

18:45.400 --> 18:46.440
That's my son.

18:48.880 --> 18:50.120
He's a big cock!

18:59.720 --> 19:01.840
Sugars, boys?
How many sugars in your tea?

19:01.840 --> 19:06.160
We don't drink tea!
Of course you don't, you're American!

19:07.360 --> 19:10.200
How many sugars
in your cap-in-chino?

19:10.200 --> 19:16.400
We don't drink cappuccino either,
or alcohol, or anything that might
taint our system. OK.

19:16.400 --> 19:20.040
For we believe our bodies
are the temple of the Lord,

19:20.040 --> 19:24.600
and if this be so, then who
would defile a temple knowingly?

19:24.600 --> 19:27.680
A fecking "No" would have done!

19:27.680 --> 19:29.920
What if we just sneak out?

19:32.960 --> 19:34.440
Now, where were we?

19:35.760 --> 19:38.520
We were talking about
the Old Testament.

19:38.520 --> 19:39.960
The Old Testament, yeah.

19:39.960 --> 19:41.280
# Hallelujah

19:41.280 --> 19:43.400
# Hallelujah

19:43.400 --> 19:45.880
# Hallelujah, hallelujah, ha... #

19:45.880 --> 19:47.960
Comes from down there, look...

19:47.960 --> 19:49.240
# Hallelujah

19:49.240 --> 19:53.880
# Hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah! #

19:53.880 --> 19:55.480
Don't mind me, son -

19:55.480 --> 19:58.880
that's just the way we used to do it
in the old days.

19:58.880 --> 20:02.720
In my day, you know.
It's all changed now, isn't it?
Yeah, all modern, yeah.

20:02.720 --> 20:03.760
# Hallelu... #

20:03.760 --> 20:04.800
SHE BEATBOXES

20:08.000 --> 20:09.080
West side!

20:11.160 --> 20:14.560
Actually, Mrs Brown,
we were talking about Abraham.

20:14.560 --> 20:16.000
Very good story, yeah.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.840
Yes, it is, ma'am. Yes, it is.

20:17.840 --> 20:22.040
Yeah, sad, but at the end,
when he's riding his chariot

20:22.040 --> 20:26.640
and the wheel came off, that was sad.

20:28.640 --> 20:30.720
Oh, no, wait, that was Kirk Douglas.

20:33.560 --> 20:37.320
Oh, Abraham! Of course, yes!
He invented the snip.

20:37.320 --> 20:41.520
The snip? The snip, you know, snip!

20:43.800 --> 20:46.760
It's a very good story, that,
it is, but it's made up.

20:46.760 --> 20:50.040
I'm sorry, Mrs Brown? It's made up.
A lot of the Bible is made up.

20:50.040 --> 20:53.040
They had to, cos otherwise
it'd be only be a pamphlet.

20:53.040 --> 20:57.440
I don't think so, Ma'am.
Norman's Ark, that's made up!
I believe his name was Noah.

20:57.440 --> 21:01.720
Well, I believe in Ireland
we call him fucking Norman!

21:01.720 --> 21:04.600
That's made up, love. No, Ma'am!

21:04.600 --> 21:06.880
Yes, son.
Think about it, think about it!

21:06.880 --> 21:10.000
I have, ma'am, I... Son, son,
it rains for 40 days and 40 nights.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.720
That's right.
And they called it a disaster. Yes.

21:12.720 --> 21:16.480
In Ireland, we call that
the fecking summer!

21:19.040 --> 21:25.120
It's made up! I mean, here.
What did he have on his boat?
Norman, what did Norman...?

21:25.120 --> 21:28.400
Are you looking up
the fecking answers?

21:28.400 --> 21:29.440
I'm sorry!

21:30.680 --> 21:34.000
What did he have on his boat?
I'll give you a hint.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.120
# He had green alligators

21:36.120 --> 21:38.280
# And long-necked geese

21:38.280 --> 21:41.200
# Humpety-back camels

21:41.200 --> 21:42.600
# And chimpanzees

21:43.480 --> 21:46.440
# Cats and rats and eph-e-lants

21:48.920 --> 21:51.920
# But just couldn't find him
a u-ni-corn! #

21:51.920 --> 21:55.360
Come on, what did he have
on the boat? Two of every animal.

21:55.360 --> 21:58.240
Two of every animal
in the whole world! That's right.

21:58.240 --> 21:59.920
On a fucking boat?!

22:01.720 --> 22:05.400
Son, we had two hamsters
for the month - they nearly
shit out the house!

22:07.400 --> 22:10.160
We'd better be going now.
No, no, wait!

22:10.160 --> 22:12.520
Hold on, I'm not fecking finished!

22:13.840 --> 22:17.960
The Three Wise Men!
Wise?! They got fecking lost!

22:26.200 --> 22:29.640
Do you know what, Granddad?
It fecking suits you!

22:29.640 --> 22:33.040
Lie down! Hey, Mammy -
Granddad looks great.

22:33.040 --> 22:36.200
Doesn't he! I'm telling you,
mahogany's his colour!

22:36.200 --> 22:39.480
Hi, Granddad!
Don't talk to him, he's booking dead!

22:39.480 --> 22:43.200
What's this?
It's Granddad's death certificate.

22:43.200 --> 22:45.840
Dr Flynn was drunk -
I got him to write one out.

22:45.840 --> 22:47.840
You don't need a death certificate.

22:47.840 --> 22:51.640
Oh, yes, I do. He's due 15,000 euro
from his union the day he dies.

22:51.640 --> 22:56.800
He's retired 15 years, I'm fucked
if I'm waiting any longer! Mammy?

22:56.800 --> 22:58.920
It's not for me, it's for you two.

22:58.920 --> 23:01.680
Get you started
in a place of your own.

23:01.680 --> 23:02.800
Thanks, Ma!

23:02.800 --> 23:06.040
Ah, "Thanks, Ma" me arse!
I'm fed up of yous crowding me out.

23:06.040 --> 23:09.840
I have no fecking privacy.
I want yous out.

23:11.320 --> 23:12.680
Thank you, Mrs Brown.

23:12.680 --> 23:16.960
Ah, don't thank me, love.
Thank Granddad for dying prematurely!

23:16.960 --> 23:22.760
You look fantastic, Cathy!
Thanks, Mammy. This is actually fun!

23:22.760 --> 23:24.480
I know, I'm getting excited!

23:24.480 --> 23:26.000
It's great practice for me,

23:26.000 --> 23:30.800
cos when he does go,
it'll be all I can do to stop meself
doing booking cartwheels!

23:32.640 --> 23:34.880
Mammy, there's loads
of people arriving!

23:34.880 --> 23:39.240
Oh, lovely! Now, come on, let's get
this show on the fecking road!

23:51.960 --> 23:56.840
Agnes, love. Aw, Jesus!
I'm so sorry for your trouble, pet!

23:56.840 --> 23:59.440
Thank you, Winnie.
It was such a shock!

24:00.440 --> 24:02.360
Where is he?

24:05.760 --> 24:09.760
Winnie, did you think
that was the fucking buffet?!

24:09.760 --> 24:12.120
Jesus, Lord,
would you look at him? Oh, God.

24:12.120 --> 24:14.560
It must have been a painful passing.

24:15.760 --> 24:18.560
# Oh, peace in the valley

24:18.560 --> 24:20.960
# Peace where he lies... #

24:20.960 --> 24:24.400
Winnie, love, that's grand.

24:26.040 --> 24:28.760
Winnie, did somebody tell you
it was a fecking karaoke?

24:28.760 --> 24:31.680
DOOR BELL RINGS

24:31.680 --> 24:34.760
They're here, get Mama Cass
off the floor, Cathy!

24:36.360 --> 24:39.480
God bless all in this house.

24:41.840 --> 24:45.920
Thank you, Father... I know.

24:45.920 --> 24:47.600
He's... I know.

24:47.600 --> 24:48.680
I... I know!

24:48.680 --> 24:50.280
How do you fucking know?!

24:51.640 --> 24:54.440
Will we begin?

24:54.440 --> 24:58.720
The Lord giveth and the Lord
taketh away. Too true! Too true!

24:58.720 --> 25:02.760
He gives us always the promise
of heaven. And hell for the sinners!

25:02.760 --> 25:05.960
Winnie, it's not a booking debate!

25:05.960 --> 25:07.920
Granddad Brown was a good man.

25:09.920 --> 25:14.240
Let us recall his contribution
to our lives. This won't take long!

25:14.240 --> 25:18.240
For without him, there'd be
none of you here today. No Agnes...

25:18.240 --> 25:20.400
He's not MY father. Mammy!

25:20.400 --> 25:22.400
..none of
her children, grandchildren.

25:22.400 --> 25:24.400
I never thought of it that way.

25:24.400 --> 25:27.520
Let us take a moment to remember him

25:27.520 --> 25:30.480
Would anybody like to say
a word in his memory?

25:34.480 --> 25:35.520
OK, then.

25:36.720 --> 25:38.280
ALL GASP

25:38.280 --> 25:40.520
Has nobody anything good to say?

25:40.520 --> 25:43.360
He's... He's not dead!

25:43.360 --> 25:48.800
No, he's alive! Oh, my God! It's
a miracle! It's a miracle, Father!

25:48.800 --> 25:51.800
How did you do it, Father Quinn?
How did you do it?

25:51.800 --> 25:54.360
Well, I don't know.
I raised my arms in the air!

25:54.360 --> 25:57.400
ALL: He raised his arms in the air!

25:57.400 --> 26:01.080
And then I looked up to the Lord.
ALL: He looked up to the Lord!

26:03.280 --> 26:04.840
# He put his hands up in the air

26:04.840 --> 26:06.360
# He put his hands up in the air

26:06.360 --> 26:08.160
# And he said a little prayer

26:08.160 --> 26:09.640
# And he said a little prayer

26:09.640 --> 26:11.400
# I've never seen the like before
