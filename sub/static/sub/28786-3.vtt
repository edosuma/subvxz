WEBVTT

00:09.620 --> 00:12.413
- Were you up all night,
my little party baby, huh?

00:12.482 --> 00:13.896
I would have totally
raged with you.

00:13.965 --> 00:15.827
- I did it.
I am caught up on "Exonerated,"

00:15.896 --> 00:18.448
and I have thoughts.
- What's "Exonerated"?

00:18.517 --> 00:19.689
- What?
- It is huge.

00:19.758 --> 00:20.827
- It's so good.

00:20.896 --> 00:22.379
- Do you remember
Audrey Colbert?

00:22.448 --> 00:24.000
She was charged with murdering
that couple

00:24.068 --> 00:25.689
who brought her to the
Four Seasons for a three-way?

00:25.758 --> 00:27.379
- Yeah, she claims
she was in the bathroom

00:27.448 --> 00:29.724
while someone else stabbed
the couple 16 times.

00:29.793 --> 00:33.068
- But she had hung juries in
both criminal and civil court.

00:33.137 --> 00:34.689
- The podcast is so good.
- Yeah.

00:34.758 --> 00:36.275
- I swear, the only thing
white women

00:36.344 --> 00:38.379
love more than Pintrest
is murder.

00:38.448 --> 00:40.448
Oh, hollandaise?
- Yeah, thanks.

00:40.517 --> 00:42.344
Wait, do they--do they
think that she did it?

00:42.413 --> 00:43.724
- Inconclusive so far,
and Audrey

00:43.793 --> 00:45.413
refused to be
interviewed for it.

00:45.482 --> 00:47.344
- She is pitching
a book, though.

00:47.413 --> 00:49.103
And we have a meeting tomorrow.

00:50.241 --> 00:51.620
- No, no tweeting.

00:51.689 --> 00:53.206
We convinced her agent
to bring it to us first.

00:53.275 --> 00:54.586
We can take it off the market

00:54.655 --> 00:56.551
before anyone else
even hears about it.

00:56.620 --> 00:58.620
- Oh, my God!

00:58.689 --> 01:00.862
- Well, I guess party baby
needs a new diaper.

01:00.931 --> 01:03.379
- Mommy wipes, Daddy diaps?
- Yeah, sounds good to me.

01:03.448 --> 01:06.689
Oh, come here.
Yes, oh, yes.

01:06.758 --> 01:09.310
- Maggie, I hope you put
a tarp down in there,

01:09.379 --> 01:10.620
because those two look
ready to make

01:10.689 --> 01:12.344
yet another
perfect-looking baby.

01:12.413 --> 01:13.793
- What?
- Clare and Josh.

01:13.862 --> 01:15.793
They're basically, like,
walking heart eye emojis.

01:15.862 --> 01:17.620
Haven't you seen it?
- You know what?

01:17.689 --> 01:19.551
I haven't been able
to look at her

01:19.620 --> 01:21.689
since, you know, the incident.

01:21.758 --> 01:24.103
- What--what incident?
- The birth.

01:24.172 --> 01:27.000
I mean, she hoisted her legs
over my shoulders,

01:27.068 --> 01:31.137
and shot that baby into my arms
in the back of an Uber.

01:31.206 --> 01:34.310
I can't un-see that.
- Oh, diva!

01:34.379 --> 01:36.862
- I haven't been able
to look at a--

01:36.931 --> 01:39.931
- Oh, my God, can you not
even say "vagina?"

01:40.000 --> 01:43.034
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
this will not do.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.379
I will fix this, okay?

01:44.448 --> 01:46.448
You will be back
on the hunt in no time.

01:46.517 --> 01:49.172
- Ew.
- I said "hunt," with an H.

01:50.551 --> 01:52.172
- Um, all right,
I'm late for a thing.

01:52.241 --> 01:55.586
So--and I have an episode of
"Exonerated" to catch up on.

01:55.655 --> 01:58.793
Bye.
- We just sat down.

02:00.586 --> 02:03.137
- You're listening
to "Exonerated."

02:03.206 --> 02:06.689
Tim Weigel met Audrey Colbert
for the first and only time

02:06.758 --> 02:10.413
in June 2017 at
the Rubin Museum in New York.

02:10.482 --> 02:12.448
- I was there one Sunday
checking out

02:12.517 --> 02:14.137
the Tibetan art exhibit,
and this woman

02:14.206 --> 02:16.896
brushed up behind me
and quickly walked away.

02:16.965 --> 02:18.896
She touched me
and she was hot,

02:18.965 --> 02:20.413
so I followed her.

02:20.482 --> 02:23.793
She moved really quickly,
darting into corners

02:23.862 --> 02:25.793
and then re-appearing
out of nowhere.

02:25.862 --> 02:28.931
It felt dangerous,
kind of sexy.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.275
- And then what happened?
- And then, we--

02:33.344 --> 02:36.689
- ♪ I make bad girls ♪

02:36.758 --> 02:40.172
♪ Look real good ♪

02:40.241 --> 02:42.034
♪ No! ♪

02:42.103 --> 02:45.689
♪ I make bad girls
look real good ♪

02:48.344 --> 02:50.172
♪ Look real good ♪

02:53.241 --> 02:55.482
- Xiexie, bai, bai, la!

02:55.551 --> 02:56.965
Ugh, creeps.

02:57.034 --> 02:59.827
I guess Time's Up hasn't
reached Shenzhen yet.

02:59.896 --> 03:01.827
Good morning, ladies!
- Good morning.

03:01.896 --> 03:03.551
- Quinn, do we have
something scheduled?

03:03.620 --> 03:05.551
- Oh, no, I had a breakfast
meeting in Midtown

03:05.620 --> 03:07.344
that went long,
and I needed a hard line

03:07.413 --> 03:08.724
for the international call,

03:08.793 --> 03:10.862
so I just came
to the nearest Wi-Fi.

03:10.931 --> 03:12.655
I hope that's okay.
- Of course!

03:12.724 --> 03:14.310
You've been on the bestseller
list for three weeks.

03:14.379 --> 03:15.827
Consider us
your Midtown hot desk.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.793
- Excellent.
I'm sure you're aware

03:17.862 --> 03:19.758
that CLAW is trending
on Twitter?

03:19.827 --> 03:22.655
Over 19,000 people
are tweeting about it, so.

03:22.724 --> 03:23.758
- Oh!
- That's great.

03:23.827 --> 03:25.931
- It is.
In fact, "The Cut"

03:26.000 --> 03:27.551
wants me to come
and talk about it

03:27.620 --> 03:29.137
on their
"How I Get It Done" series,

03:29.206 --> 03:31.655
and I would love for
my publisher to interview me.

03:31.724 --> 03:33.862
- That's wonderful.
Kelsey?

03:33.931 --> 03:37.137
- Okay, sounds good.
- Oh, good.

03:37.206 --> 03:39.206
They'll reach out to you
with all the details.

03:39.275 --> 03:41.896
And thank you for being
so accommodating.

03:46.448 --> 03:47.620
That's Mandarin for "good-bye."

03:52.379 --> 03:55.068
- Whoa, lots of
male energy here.

03:55.137 --> 03:57.034
But they're all dealing
with the same trauma you are,

03:57.103 --> 03:59.620
so don't think of men
as the enemy for once.

03:59.689 --> 04:01.689
- I don't think of men
as the enemy.

04:01.758 --> 04:03.620
- Oh, yeah, no, me neither.
Definitely not.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.482
- Let's get started.
Hi, I'm Beth.

04:11.551 --> 04:13.482
I will be your guide.

04:13.551 --> 04:16.068
Many partners,
after witnessing birth,

04:16.137 --> 04:19.103
have trouble seeing the vagina
as sexual again,

04:19.172 --> 04:20.448
and this is natural.

04:20.517 --> 04:23.379
It was a source
of joy and warmth and...

04:25.586 --> 04:28.586
Love and heat.

04:28.655 --> 04:32.413
And now, it's a sight
of jarring trauma.

04:32.482 --> 04:33.724
And we can run from that,

04:33.793 --> 04:37.586
or we can dive
right in headfirst,

04:37.655 --> 04:39.724
and reclaim that love.

04:39.793 --> 04:41.931
So I encourage you all
to share your stories,

04:42.000 --> 04:43.379
no matter how scary they are.

04:43.448 --> 04:44.620
- Labor was easy.

04:44.689 --> 04:46.241
The baby came out
really quickly.

04:46.310 --> 04:50.206
And then, her uterus just sort
of fell out on the table.

04:50.275 --> 04:51.827
Like giblets.

04:51.896 --> 04:54.034
- The placenta dislodged
from the cord,

04:54.103 --> 04:55.793
so they had to
retrieve it manually.

04:55.862 --> 04:57.103
Did you know
they make rubber gloves

04:57.172 --> 04:59.000
that go all the way up
to the elbow?

04:59.068 --> 05:03.344
- The baby's arm was just
sticking out of it, flailing.

05:03.413 --> 05:05.517
For, like, five minutes.

05:07.172 --> 05:10.137
- I'm so sorry.
What--her arm came out, and--

05:15.034 --> 05:17.793
- Everybody's obsessed
with Audrey Colbert,

05:17.862 --> 05:19.344
but nobody really knows her.

05:19.413 --> 05:20.655
They just know
the salacious stories

05:20.724 --> 05:22.724
they've heard on "Exonerated."

05:22.793 --> 05:23.965
But this is her life!

05:24.034 --> 05:25.862
Is it glamorous?
Absolutely.

05:25.931 --> 05:28.034
Is it sexy?
Routinely.

05:28.103 --> 05:30.068
But is it criminal?

05:35.137 --> 05:37.103
And this is where
you're supposed to say "no."

05:37.172 --> 05:38.586
We rehearsed this.

05:38.655 --> 05:41.000
- Sorry, I forgot.

05:41.068 --> 05:45.137
- Um, we are huge fans
of "Exonerated."

05:45.206 --> 05:48.206
- Yeah.
- But we know that the podcast

05:48.275 --> 05:49.793
isn't telling us everything.

05:49.862 --> 05:52.551
- Yeah, what we're interested
in is your story.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.034
You know, in your words.

05:54.103 --> 05:56.586
- But this will not be
a confession or a denial.

05:56.655 --> 05:58.103
This will be the truth.

05:58.172 --> 06:01.448
The good, the bad,
and everything in between.

06:01.517 --> 06:03.827
Is she promiscuous?
Often.

06:03.896 --> 06:06.689
Is she jealous?
Almost pathologically.

06:06.758 --> 06:08.655
Is she a murderer?

06:11.137 --> 06:13.517
Audrey, this is where
you say no, remember?

06:13.586 --> 06:15.241
- No.

06:19.931 --> 06:21.827
Do you think I did it?

06:25.068 --> 06:26.758
- No.

06:26.827 --> 06:28.413
- Definitely not.
- No.

06:28.482 --> 06:31.689
- Good, because if you thought
I had killed two people

06:31.758 --> 06:32.931
and you still wanted
to publish my book,

06:33.000 --> 06:34.068
I don't think
I could trust you,

06:34.137 --> 06:35.931
and I really need to trust you.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.241
That insufferable podcast

06:37.310 --> 06:39.034
turned me into
a national supervillain.

06:39.103 --> 06:40.620
- International.
Huge in Europe.

06:40.689 --> 06:43.620
- This is my opportunity
to clear my name.

06:43.689 --> 06:46.517
A book isn't
going to be sliced up--

06:46.586 --> 06:48.000
- Phrasing.
- Into horror memes

06:48.068 --> 06:50.482
like my Megyn Kelly interview,
or chopped up

06:50.551 --> 06:53.620
to make me look like some sort
of dangerous psychopath.

06:56.137 --> 07:00.413
Does that sound like something
that you can help me with?

07:00.482 --> 07:03.034
- Yes.
- Definitely.

07:03.103 --> 07:08.517
Mm-hmm.
- Good.

07:08.586 --> 07:10.241
- Yeah, right.

07:21.103 --> 07:23.068
- What was that?
- A crippling lack

07:23.137 --> 07:24.793
of media training,
but don't worry.

07:24.862 --> 07:26.965
We will fix that
before the book tour.

07:27.034 --> 07:29.379
The good news is she likes you!
- Great.

07:29.448 --> 07:31.517
You're not taking this
anywhere else, right?

07:31.586 --> 07:33.758
- 650, and no one
will even know

07:33.827 --> 07:36.137
she's writing a book
until we announce.

07:37.517 --> 07:40.448
Yeah, okay.
Great, yeah.

07:40.517 --> 07:42.620
Seriously, you can't
tell anybody.

07:42.689 --> 07:44.758
- Okay.
- She's insanely secretive.

07:44.827 --> 07:49.068
Don't tell her I said that.
Bye.

07:55.931 --> 07:58.827
- A bottle of Dom, please.
I'm celebrating.

07:58.896 --> 08:02.379
- Make that two.
- Whoa.

08:02.448 --> 08:04.344
Where have you been hiding?

08:04.413 --> 08:08.206
- I'm not hiding, just busy.
- With?

08:08.275 --> 08:10.344
I mean, you barely
text me back anymore.

08:10.413 --> 08:12.793
What's going on?
Where are you working?

08:12.862 --> 08:16.310
Are you working?
- Look, I can't say just yet,

08:16.379 --> 08:17.793
but it's big.

08:17.862 --> 08:19.517
- You know, you don't
need to pretend.

08:19.586 --> 08:21.137
You're going to find something.

08:21.206 --> 08:23.137
- I have, and when I close it,
you'll hear about it.

08:23.206 --> 08:26.275
- Okay.
- You don't believe me.

08:26.344 --> 08:27.793
- Um, there's only
one bottle left.

08:29.689 --> 08:32.448
It's his.
On me.

08:32.517 --> 08:35.379
- You're not paying.
- You're not working.

08:35.448 --> 08:37.413
- You're not listening.

08:41.310 --> 08:42.793
- Oh, whoa.

08:42.862 --> 08:44.586
You're not going
to help me drink it?

08:51.068 --> 08:56.551
- Hey, she is finally asleep.
For good, this time.

08:58.413 --> 08:59.862
Don't jinx it.

08:59.931 --> 09:01.517
- You want to go
sleep in your bed?

09:01.586 --> 09:06.413
- I'm too tired to go to bed.
I sleep where I can now.

09:08.241 --> 09:12.551
All right, here.
Lift up.

09:12.620 --> 09:15.862
Oh, there we go.

09:17.793 --> 09:19.448
- Oh, I should
clean her bottles.

09:19.517 --> 09:20.862
- No, I already did,

09:20.931 --> 09:23.413
right after I emptied
the Diaper Genie.

09:23.482 --> 09:26.310
- Oh, thank you.

09:26.379 --> 09:31.448
Truly, you've been so amazing.
- Hm.

09:31.517 --> 09:34.724
- I don't know how I thought
I could do this alone.

09:35.896 --> 09:37.517
- Yeah.

09:37.586 --> 09:40.551
Well, I've done about a tenth
of the work that you have,

09:40.620 --> 09:42.827
but you're welcome.

09:45.206 --> 09:48.000
Clare?

09:48.068 --> 09:49.793
Hey.

10:03.793 --> 10:05.275
- Liza, Kelsey, anyone?

10:05.344 --> 10:06.482
Yeah, a little help.
- Oh, God, Diana!

10:06.551 --> 10:07.724
- What?
- Please.

10:07.793 --> 10:09.103
- Jeez.
- Get me to the chair.

10:09.172 --> 10:10.620
- Okay, all right.
- I'm good, I'm fine.

10:10.689 --> 10:11.689
- All right, all right,
all right.

10:11.758 --> 10:13.793
- Okay.
- What happened?

10:13.862 --> 10:15.344
- We've got a problem.

10:15.413 --> 10:16.793
I was at Pilates
with my publisher ladies,

10:16.862 --> 10:18.275
and politely announcing
that CLAW

10:18.344 --> 10:20.000
is going to be number one
on "The New York Times"

10:20.068 --> 10:21.931
bestseller list this week.
- What, officially?

10:22.000 --> 10:23.586
- Okay, you've got
to be kidding me.

10:23.655 --> 10:25.620
- Could you get me
my prescription from my purse

10:25.689 --> 10:27.103
and stop interrupting, please?

10:27.172 --> 10:29.000
Anyway, I announce,
and Jackie Dunn,

10:29.068 --> 10:30.413
who is obsessed with me,

10:30.482 --> 10:32.034
always turns everything
into a contest,

10:32.103 --> 10:34.068
claims that she has
an inside track

10:34.137 --> 10:36.482
on a new book
by Audrey Colbert.

10:36.551 --> 10:38.000
- That's impossible.

10:38.068 --> 10:39.793
- Redmond said he wasn't
taking her anywhere else.

10:39.862 --> 10:41.586
- According to my group,
she is pitching

10:41.655 --> 10:43.068
to half
the major houses in town.

10:43.137 --> 10:44.689
- But that's our book!
- Oh, my God.

10:44.758 --> 10:45.965
- I know, I got so frazzled

10:46.034 --> 10:47.448
that I got caught up
in the reformer.

10:47.517 --> 10:48.965
Could you just help me
open this, please?

10:49.034 --> 10:51.000
And can someone
get me an espresso?

10:53.103 --> 10:54.344
Postpone the
power trip, Kelsey.

10:54.413 --> 10:56.413
I am handicapped.
- We need to get Redmond

10:56.482 --> 10:58.206
on the phone right now.

11:00.310 --> 11:02.620
- Hold on, I'll be right back
with espresso.

11:02.689 --> 11:05.517
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Just hand me the--

11:08.482 --> 11:12.034
- Kelsey, what self-destructive
idiot gave you this number?

11:12.103 --> 11:13.724
- Your assistant.
She owed me.

11:13.793 --> 11:15.103
- Hi, Hodor.

11:15.172 --> 11:16.689
Listen, I'm taking
an infrared sauna.

11:16.758 --> 11:18.206
Can we make this a quickie?

11:18.275 --> 11:20.206
- Yeah, you screwed us
on Audrey Colbert!

11:20.275 --> 11:22.103
- I said "quickie,"
not no lube.

11:22.172 --> 11:24.206
- You said it was ours,
and now, you're taking it wide.

11:24.275 --> 11:25.551
- We gave you the pre-empt
you asked for,

11:25.620 --> 11:27.068
the meeting went great,

11:27.137 --> 11:29.724
and we are about to top
the best-seller list.

11:29.793 --> 11:31.137
- I saw.
Quinn's number one

11:31.206 --> 11:33.793
with a dagger.
Con-drag-ulations.

11:33.862 --> 11:35.310
- What are you talking about?

11:35.379 --> 11:38.068
- Quinn's shiny number one
comes accessorized

11:38.137 --> 11:40.862
with a dagger on every list,
meaning bulk sales.

11:40.931 --> 11:43.931
Meaning you bought
your best-seller.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.517
- What?
No, listen.

11:45.586 --> 11:47.000
I'm just as surprised
as anyone,

11:47.068 --> 11:49.620
but that book's a hit.
It's trending on Twitter.

11:49.689 --> 11:51.206
- I know, an army
of Chinese bots

11:51.275 --> 11:54.275
inserting "#CLAW" into every
conversation they can.

11:54.344 --> 11:57.310
Which means, like your
sales numbers, it's a scam.

11:57.379 --> 11:59.206
Everyone in town
is talking about it.

11:59.275 --> 12:02.586
It's suspicious, and Audrey
already has enough of that.

12:02.655 --> 12:04.344
- Redmond, that's not fair.
- Thanks for calling.

12:04.413 --> 12:07.931
Never do it again.
Tell my assistant she's fired.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.310
- All right, I'm here.
Let's call him.

12:10.379 --> 12:12.758
- He's not the problem.
We need to find Quinn.

12:16.241 --> 12:17.586
- I'm going to need her
to slow down

12:17.655 --> 12:19.275
until my Vicodin kicks in.

12:19.344 --> 12:21.448
- Enjoy.

12:23.689 --> 12:25.344
- Hi.
- Hi there.

12:25.413 --> 12:27.965
Beth, remember?
- Yeah, Maggie.

12:28.034 --> 12:29.793
How you doing?
Um, I'm sorry

12:29.862 --> 12:31.344
that I ran out of here
so quickly.

12:31.413 --> 12:34.172
You seem great,
but I'm beyond help.

12:34.241 --> 12:37.000
- Oh, that's not
in my vocabulary.

12:37.068 --> 12:38.689
You know, there are plenty
of other methods

12:38.758 --> 12:40.965
we could use
to re-acquaint you,

12:41.034 --> 12:43.310
and I also teach privates.

12:43.379 --> 12:44.517
- Oh.

12:46.172 --> 12:47.896
- So talk me through it.
What does it mean?

12:47.965 --> 12:49.206
Where did you leave it?

12:49.275 --> 12:50.620
Was there any
nocturnal frotting?

12:50.689 --> 12:52.482
- She was already
getting ready for work

12:52.551 --> 12:54.379
by the time that I woke up,
so we didn't talk about it.

12:54.448 --> 12:56.965
But, I just--
- Okay, okay.

12:57.034 --> 13:00.275
So what--what do you want?
- I don't know.

13:00.344 --> 13:04.034
I feel, like,
maybe I should just do it.

13:04.103 --> 13:05.724
You know, we're still
legally married.

13:05.793 --> 13:08.206
I mean, it would
be better for Gemma.

13:08.275 --> 13:12.172
- Josh, that's not my question.
What do you want?

13:14.172 --> 13:16.310
- I don't think that
we're right for each other.

13:16.379 --> 13:19.655
- Okay, then you have to
cut it off, once and for all.

13:19.724 --> 13:21.931
Even if she looks at you with
those little cartoon deer eyes

13:22.000 --> 13:23.482
and begs you to do it
for the baby.

13:25.103 --> 13:26.517
- I know it's not a fun
conversation to have, Josh.

13:26.586 --> 13:29.965
But you're a dad now, okay?
And dads have to be tough.

13:30.034 --> 13:31.793
- Yeah.
- Except for my dad.

13:31.862 --> 13:33.482
God, he is such
a little bottom.

13:37.551 --> 13:39.724
- I've never even heard
of the Ardmore Club.

13:39.793 --> 13:41.620
What is it?
Like, Soho House for oligarchs?

13:41.689 --> 13:43.241
- Quinn's showing off,
so we'll ignore

13:43.310 --> 13:44.896
that she's ruining
our reputation.

13:44.965 --> 13:47.103
- Hello, Millennial.
Thank you for coming.

13:47.172 --> 13:48.896
I have the talking points
for the event.

13:48.965 --> 13:52.758
- Great, do they mention that
you faked your best-seller?

13:52.827 --> 13:54.379
- What are you talking about?

13:54.448 --> 13:57.068
- You bulk-bought a ton
of books to boost sales.

13:57.137 --> 13:59.310
They track that
and note it on the list.

13:59.379 --> 14:01.275
- Okay, well, tell that
to the fans on Twitter.

14:01.344 --> 14:03.758
- Also fake.
Most of the hashtags

14:03.827 --> 14:05.206
are traced to Chinese bots,

14:05.275 --> 14:06.655
especially the ones
defending it.

14:06.724 --> 14:09.103
- Is anything
about this book real?

14:09.172 --> 14:11.758
- The money the book's
bringing in is real.

14:11.827 --> 14:12.827
What else do you need?

14:12.896 --> 14:14.310
- My reputation.
- Oh.

14:14.379 --> 14:16.482
- Integrity still means
something in publishing.

14:16.551 --> 14:18.241
This is screwing
with my business.

14:18.310 --> 14:20.965
- Who even knows?
Book Twitter?

14:21.034 --> 14:23.000
- They're our peers,
and they talk.

14:23.068 --> 14:24.551
- Do you know how hard it is

14:24.620 --> 14:27.241
to run for office
in this country as a woman?

14:27.310 --> 14:30.344
I have to control
every single detail.

14:30.413 --> 14:32.724
No mistakes, no second chances,
no leaks.

14:32.793 --> 14:35.413
If anyone catches wind
too soon that I am running,

14:35.482 --> 14:37.896
the media will have
extra time to drag me.

14:37.965 --> 14:39.241
If I get in too late,

14:39.310 --> 14:41.103
somebody else's momentum
might be too strong.

14:41.172 --> 14:44.448
And none of this timing
and precision and secrecy

14:44.517 --> 14:47.103
means anything without--
and say it with me.

14:47.172 --> 14:49.344
Name recognition.

14:49.413 --> 14:51.310
- So you bought yourself a hit.

14:51.379 --> 14:53.482
- "CLAW"'s numbers weren't
where they needed to be,

14:53.551 --> 14:55.034
so I got them there.

14:55.103 --> 14:56.896
And in exactly 11 weeks,

14:56.965 --> 14:58.551
when I announce
that I am running,

14:58.620 --> 15:00.275
I will have already been
on all the talk shows

15:00.344 --> 15:02.827
promoting my book, because why?

15:02.896 --> 15:04.275
It's a "New York Times"
best-seller.

15:04.344 --> 15:06.034
It says so right on the cover.

15:06.103 --> 15:09.586
- This is completely unethical,
and it's already hurting me.

15:09.655 --> 15:12.034
- This controversy
will be over in a day,

15:12.103 --> 15:14.172
and when all is said and done,
your company

15:14.241 --> 15:16.137
will have pocketed
millions of dollars.

15:16.206 --> 15:18.827
Now, do I have to call
"The Cut" and tell them

15:18.896 --> 15:21.103
that Millennial doesn't support
it's author enough

15:21.172 --> 15:23.551
to show up
to a very important event?

15:26.448 --> 15:29.172
- I'll be there.
- That's a good decision.

15:29.241 --> 15:30.896
See you tonight.

15:37.551 --> 15:39.344
- Charles?

16:09.827 --> 16:12.793
- What have you got there?
- Oh, my God.

16:12.862 --> 16:15.344
You scared me.

16:15.413 --> 16:17.965
Uh, I don't know.
It was just sitting out.

16:18.034 --> 16:19.896
I...

16:19.965 --> 16:22.413
are you taking out a loan
on the townhouse?

16:23.862 --> 16:28.413
- Oh, I'm, uh--just moving
some things around.

16:29.724 --> 16:33.103
- That's a lot of money.
Is everything okay?

16:34.655 --> 16:38.758
- Have you listened to
episode seven of "Exonerated"?

16:38.827 --> 16:40.896
- Uh, no, not yet.

16:40.965 --> 16:44.241
- Audrey breaks into
her ex's house.

16:44.310 --> 16:46.344
- I didn't break in.
I have a key.

16:46.413 --> 16:49.896
- Hm, well,
that's what Audrey said, too.

16:49.965 --> 16:56.206
He came home and found her
going through his things.

16:56.275 --> 17:00.482
- What happened?
- She--

17:00.551 --> 17:02.724
she convinced him
not to call the police.

17:02.793 --> 17:04.344
- And how did she do that?

17:05.965 --> 17:08.758
Well, I guess I need to listen
to episode seven.

17:19.689 --> 17:21.965
- She's been asleep
for an hour.

17:22.034 --> 17:24.172
She should be out
until I get home.

17:24.241 --> 17:26.413
Just a client dinner,
nothing fancy.

17:26.482 --> 17:28.655
So I should be back
in a few hours.

17:28.724 --> 17:30.413
- Hey, Clare, can we--

17:30.482 --> 17:32.517
can we talk
about the other night?

17:32.586 --> 17:35.068
- Okay.

17:35.137 --> 17:37.310
- Look, I just want to say,
first off,

17:37.379 --> 17:41.827
I am so happy
that we have this baby,

17:41.896 --> 17:44.310
and that we're
raising her together.

17:44.379 --> 17:47.620
But you and me--
- Are you breaking up with me?

17:47.689 --> 17:51.206
- Are we together?
- Oh, thank God.

17:51.275 --> 17:53.862
I was so worried you were
going to propose again.

17:53.931 --> 17:55.931
- What are you talking about?
We're still married.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.655
- I know,
and the other night was--

17:59.724 --> 18:01.931
- Yeah.
- For a second, I thought,

18:02.000 --> 18:03.344
"Wouldn't it be nice

18:03.413 --> 18:05.551
if we found a way
back to each other?"

18:05.620 --> 18:10.448
- But?
- But the second I woke up,

18:10.517 --> 18:12.551
it all came rushing back.

18:12.620 --> 18:15.103
Everything I felt when you
left me in Ireland.

18:15.172 --> 18:18.068
We keep trying to
force ourselves together.

18:18.137 --> 18:22.068
You know, for a green card,
for the baby.

18:22.137 --> 18:25.275
And though those seem
like good reasons,

18:25.344 --> 18:27.793
they're not the right ones.

18:27.862 --> 18:30.965
- Then let's do this
the right way.

18:31.034 --> 18:34.206
Okay, this is not
just about us anymore.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.827
Clare.
- Josh.

18:43.896 --> 18:45.931
- Will you divorce me?

18:46.000 --> 18:47.655
- I will.

18:51.206 --> 18:53.724
- Thanks for dinner.
That was so nice.

18:53.793 --> 18:55.206
I mean, I didn't even

18:55.275 --> 18:59.241
think about that
while I was with you.

18:59.310 --> 19:00.827
- Well, that's not the goal.

19:00.896 --> 19:02.862
To not think about it
all together.

19:02.931 --> 19:06.344
See, I think group was
too much, too fast.

19:06.413 --> 19:10.000
Maybe we should take it slower.

19:10.068 --> 19:12.482
- Slow is good, yeah.
What'd you have in mind?

19:12.551 --> 19:15.517
- I don't know, maybe...

19:17.689 --> 19:20.000
How's that?
- That was pretty good.

19:20.068 --> 19:22.896
Maybe we could, uh,
speed things up a little bit.

19:22.965 --> 19:24.000
- Well, maybe if you--

19:32.517 --> 19:34.344
- And so I said,
"Jack, I don't need

19:34.413 --> 19:37.379
"ten days meditating in Myanmar
to know myself.

19:37.448 --> 19:38.827
"I already know
that sounds like hell.

19:38.896 --> 19:41.000
I'm getting on the jet
and going to Macau."

19:41.068 --> 19:42.206
And I did.

19:46.517 --> 19:48.620
- What a relatable story!

19:50.172 --> 19:52.310
Let's take some questions.

19:55.965 --> 19:57.413
- Hi, Quinn.
- Hi.

19:57.482 --> 20:00.000
- Congratulations on
the success of the book.

20:00.068 --> 20:01.896
- Oh, thank you.
- Any comment

20:01.965 --> 20:05.000
on the dagger
next to your number one?

20:05.068 --> 20:07.586
- You know, I am just--
I'm not as acquainted

20:07.655 --> 20:09.482
with the bestseller list
as you all are,

20:09.551 --> 20:11.103
so I don't really know.

20:11.172 --> 20:13.793
- Were bulk sales responsible

20:13.862 --> 20:16.620
for "CLAW"'s
astronomical numbers?

20:16.689 --> 20:18.517
- My publicist did say
that there were

20:18.586 --> 20:20.413
a number of universities
that wanted

20:20.482 --> 20:24.034
to use the book for syllabi,
so next question.

20:24.103 --> 20:27.034
- That wasn't really an answer.
- Okay.

20:27.103 --> 20:29.379
Uh, it sounds like
you're questioning

20:29.448 --> 20:31.172
the validity
of "CLAW"'s numbers,

20:31.241 --> 20:32.724
and I want you to know
that integrity

20:32.793 --> 20:34.896
is of the utmost
importance to me.

20:34.965 --> 20:37.172
- The book's ethos
suggests otherwise.

20:37.241 --> 20:39.379
- So you read it.
Thank you.

20:39.448 --> 20:42.448
Um, well, I really am
a neophyte at this.

20:42.517 --> 20:46.517
So my publisher can speak
to this better than I can.

20:51.034 --> 20:54.241
- Quinn's right.
Integrity is important.

20:54.310 --> 20:56.931
So is honesty.

20:57.000 --> 21:00.448
There were bulk sales that
contributed to "CLAW"'s numbers

21:00.517 --> 21:03.620
due to a series of forthcoming
speaking events.

21:03.689 --> 21:08.448
I am extremely proud to be
the first to announce

21:08.517 --> 21:11.413
that Quinn Tyler
is running for Senate

21:11.482 --> 21:13.448
in the great state
of California.

21:23.724 --> 21:26.206
- Do you have any idea
what you just did?

21:26.275 --> 21:28.586
- Take a bow.

21:28.655 --> 21:30.620
- ♪ The line is ticking,
push us on ♪

21:30.689 --> 21:33.896
♪ Stepping up, game on,
game on, game on ♪

21:33.965 --> 21:36.482
- ♪ You can't keep my down ♪
- ♪ Game on ♪

21:36.551 --> 21:37.965
- ♪ Can't keep my down ♪

21:45.310 --> 21:46.862
- Thanks for
meeting us, Redmond.

21:46.931 --> 21:49.862
I assume you saw Quinn Tyler's
story in the "Times."

21:49.931 --> 21:52.827
And the "Post," and "WIRED."
- I did.

21:52.896 --> 21:55.758
Kelsey, you're a messy bitch
who lives for drama.

21:55.827 --> 21:57.620
I stan.

21:57.689 --> 21:59.344
- So now that the dagger
is cleared up,

21:59.413 --> 22:01.275
we want to talk about
Audrey Colbert again.

22:01.344 --> 22:03.068
- Aw, adorbs!

22:03.137 --> 22:05.448
Well, I'm sure she would come
racing back to you,

22:05.517 --> 22:06.689
but we just accepted

22:06.758 --> 22:08.517
another offer last night.
- What?

22:08.586 --> 22:09.862
- It wasn't Jackie Dunn,
was it?

22:09.931 --> 22:11.620
- No, we actually
went with a new

22:11.689 --> 22:13.931
little start-up called Mercury.
- Who?

22:14.000 --> 22:15.413
- What masochist would start

22:15.482 --> 22:16.758
a publishing company
in this client?

22:16.827 --> 22:18.827
- Not my money, not my problem.

22:18.896 --> 22:22.379
But Kelsey, you do know
the editor very well.

22:22.448 --> 22:24.482
Zane Anders?

22:24.551 --> 22:27.068
- Unbelievable.

22:27.137 --> 22:29.241
At least I didn't pay
for that champagne.

22:29.310 --> 22:30.551
- What if we counter the offer?

22:30.620 --> 22:32.758
- Whatever it is,
we will top it.

22:32.827 --> 22:35.793
- Well, the offer
is now 800,000.

22:37.275 --> 22:39.241
Can you top that?

22:41.310 --> 22:42.241
- That's a lot of money.

22:43.724 --> 22:46.034
- It's "Nightline" calling
for Audrey again.

22:46.103 --> 22:47.517
Hello?

22:47.586 --> 22:49.689
They have
a better table uptown.

22:49.758 --> 22:51.413
Good-bye!

22:53.379 --> 22:54.655
- I don't understand.

22:54.724 --> 22:57.034
Where would Zane
get that kind of money?
