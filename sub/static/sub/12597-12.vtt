00:04.105 --> 00:05.804
(thunder cracks)

00:09.176 --> 00:10.976
Come on, SkyVolt.

00:10.978 --> 00:12.945
SkyVolt, Tess.
Please wake up.

00:12.947 --> 00:14.913
(coughs)

00:18.386 --> 00:22.454
Garrison? (chuckles)

00:22.456 --> 00:25.190
I don't remember anything
after the explosion.

00:25.192 --> 00:27.693
You saved me?

00:27.695 --> 00:29.294
(chuckles)

00:29.296 --> 00:31.530
You can't save the world
unless someone saves you.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.132
(laughs)

00:33.134 --> 00:36.869
Besides, how else will
I get you to go out with me?

00:40.908 --> 00:42.241
-Cut!
-(bell rings)

00:42.243 --> 00:46.011
Oh! Forget SkyVolt's lightning.

00:46.013 --> 00:48.547
The real electricity
is Tess and Garrison.

00:48.549 --> 00:53.552
(gasps) I am shipping
"Tarrison" so hard.

00:53.554 --> 00:56.822
I just look at Liv and imagine
the girl I wanna go out with.

00:56.824 --> 01:02.594
Which is easy because
she has the same face
as the girl I wanna go out with.

01:02.596 --> 01:05.364
Yeah. He has a huge crush
on my sister,

01:05.366 --> 01:07.099
but he's too afraid
to ask her out,

01:07.101 --> 01:10.269
-'cause she's so scary!
-(laughs)

01:10.271 --> 01:14.106
I'm not scared. She just ended
a long-term relationship

01:14.108 --> 01:16.041
and might not wanna date.

01:16.043 --> 01:19.178
And if she says no,
it'll be weird and...

01:19.180 --> 01:20.913
Okay, I'm scared.

01:20.915 --> 01:24.349
Liv, we are a <i> Voltage </i> family.

01:24.351 --> 01:26.985
Help your brother by getting him
a date with your sister.

01:28.189 --> 01:30.122
I don't know, I'm...

01:30.124 --> 01:32.458
I guess I could ask Maddie
if she's ready
to start dating again.

01:32.460 --> 01:36.095
But bad things happen when I
get involved in her love life.

01:36.097 --> 01:38.297
You know, like,
she gets really mad at me,

01:38.299 --> 01:40.466
and basketballs
fly at my head,

01:40.468 --> 01:42.501
and designer clothing
gets burned in the front yard.

01:44.138 --> 01:46.472
That sounds like Maddie.

01:46.474 --> 01:48.407
Liv is on the case.

01:48.409 --> 01:51.376
Oh! I love my <i> Voltage </i> family.

01:51.378 --> 01:53.412
(laughs)

01:53.414 --> 01:56.215
Unless they ate all my fancy
LA cheesecake again.

01:56.217 --> 01:58.817
If so, someone is fired!

-Hi!
-Oh! (laughs)

02:58.979 --> 03:01.847
You... are at my work!

03:01.849 --> 03:05.150
For the third time
this week. (chuckles)

03:05.152 --> 03:09.454
Mom, is everything okay?
Did you... did you
lose your job?

03:11.525 --> 03:13.025
No, sweetie, no!

03:13.027 --> 03:16.395
I just love... love, you know,
checking in on my girl.

03:16.397 --> 03:19.398
-Well, that's really sweet.
-Oh...

03:19.400 --> 03:23.402
You know what else is sweet?
Cheesecake.

03:23.404 --> 03:26.572
Gemma flies it in
from Corsun's Deli in LA.

03:26.574 --> 03:28.540
(chuckles)

03:28.542 --> 03:32.711
Sweet and fancy
in my mouth. Mm!

03:32.713 --> 03:35.447
See you later, Mom.
You know, like at home.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.383
Bye, Liv!

03:39.420 --> 03:40.852
Oh!

03:40.854 --> 03:43.121
And hello, cheesecake.

03:53.734 --> 03:57.269
My cheesecake is gone again?!

03:57.271 --> 03:59.771
Oh, uh, Dave, you're fired.

04:05.346 --> 04:10.782
Whoo! I just out-ran two dogs,
a delivery truck,

04:10.784 --> 04:14.553
and the kid on the scooter
who likes to race dogs
and delivery trucks.

04:14.555 --> 04:18.724
Wow! You must be exhausted.

04:18.726 --> 04:21.460
Like, maybe you're too exhausted

04:21.462 --> 04:24.529
to kick, punch or chase me?

04:24.531 --> 04:28.467
I mean, I only do those things
when you're meddling
in my love life.

04:28.469 --> 04:32.571
And what have I told you
about meddling in my love life?

04:32.573 --> 04:37.542
Um...

04:37.544 --> 04:39.111
To not do it?

04:39.113 --> 04:40.479
Exactly.

04:40.481 --> 04:43.248
Okay, but what if you
have a secret admirer

04:43.250 --> 04:46.618
and I know who it is? Because
you have a secret admirer
and I know who it is!

04:48.055 --> 04:50.756
Liv, I am not interested
in dating anyone right now.

04:50.758 --> 04:53.125
And you know what?
You're meddling.

04:53.127 --> 04:58.163
So I'm going to give you three
choices: kick, punch or chase.

04:58.165 --> 05:01.933
Um... kick.

05:01.935 --> 05:04.636
No, no, no! Chase!
And I get a five-second lead!

05:05.572 --> 05:07.306
Take all day, Liv.

05:07.308 --> 05:10.309
I'll still find you.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.480
Josh:
<i>SkyVolt, this is good.</i>

05:15.482 --> 05:17.683
<i>We're getting close</i>
<i>to finding Zaydock.</i>

05:17.685 --> 05:19.618
<i>So far, he was spotted</i>
<i>at the observatory, the museum,</i>

05:19.620 --> 05:20.819
<i>and the abandoned copper mine.</i>

05:20.821 --> 05:23.088
<i>There's a pattern.</i>

05:23.090 --> 05:25.691
<i>I think we can track him.</i>

05:25.693 --> 05:30.796
<i>Zaydock's headed</i>
<i>to the football field where</i>
<i>I was struck by lightning.</i>

05:30.798 --> 05:32.597
<i>And that's gonna be</i>
<i>where I take him down.</i>

05:32.599 --> 05:34.766
But he's not there
when I get there!

05:34.768 --> 05:37.469
Why, Liv?! Why?!

05:37.471 --> 05:38.737
(mouths)
Sorry.

05:40.174 --> 05:42.841
Parker, do you see what I see?

05:42.843 --> 05:46.678
Parker: That weird shadow
behind the gears?

05:46.680 --> 05:49.381
-What is that?
-It looks like a...

05:49.383 --> 05:52.351
(gasping) A ghost!

05:54.288 --> 05:58.223
And you look like a...
(gasping) a munch.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.294
Because ghosts aren't real.

06:02.296 --> 06:06.131
Actually, our entire crew,
including myself,

06:06.133 --> 06:07.666
believes that
our set is haunted.

06:07.668 --> 06:10.535
Doors get left open,
things go missing,

06:10.537 --> 06:12.671
there are always
these weird, cold drafts.

06:12.673 --> 06:16.875
See, dude? There's totally
a ghost on that set!

06:16.877 --> 06:18.977
I guarantee it.

06:18.979 --> 06:21.980
-Guarantee?
-Mm-hm.

06:21.982 --> 06:24.983
This is about
to get real stupid, real quick.

06:24.985 --> 06:30.822
So, Liv, can we get
on your set to ghost-hunt?

06:30.824 --> 06:34.726
-Please?
-Please?

06:34.728 --> 06:38.430
Fine! I will call Gemma.
Just don't do that stupid dance
you do when you get excited.

06:38.432 --> 06:40.599
Both: We're going
a-ghost-huntin'!

06:40.601 --> 06:45.137
We're going a-ghost-huntin'!
We're going... a-ghost-huntin'!

06:46.106 --> 06:47.839
(doorbell rings)

06:47.841 --> 06:50.142
Wait, you guys!
What about the show?

06:53.414 --> 06:57.682
Liv, I'm here to ask Maddie out.
Whoo! (laughs)

06:57.684 --> 07:00.385
Oh, no, no!
Didn't you get my text?

07:00.387 --> 07:02.521
She said she's not ready
to start dating yet.

07:02.523 --> 07:05.357
I know, I know, but I decided
I'm gonna do it anyway.

07:05.359 --> 07:08.727
Go big or go home, right?
Whoo! (gasps)

07:08.729 --> 07:11.129
Wow. It's a bold move.

07:11.131 --> 07:14.199
Um, Maddie's just
playing out back, so...

07:17.704 --> 07:20.972
This is as far as I will take
you for fear of having a
basketball tossed at my head

07:20.974 --> 07:22.541
or hair ripped from my scalp.

07:24.711 --> 07:26.378
It's happened.

07:27.748 --> 07:31.616
So... good luck.

07:33.821 --> 07:37.656
Three, two, one.

07:40.727 --> 07:44.796
Oh! Mad Dog Rooney in the house!

07:44.798 --> 07:49.234
Well, outside the house,
but close to the house!

07:49.236 --> 07:52.304
I guess I'm saying
it's your house.

07:52.306 --> 07:56.308
Hello, Josh.
Why are you being so weird?

07:56.310 --> 08:01.780
Weird? What?
The J Man ain't weird. Okay?

08:01.782 --> 08:04.216
Okay, I just called myself
"the J Man." That's weird.

08:06.753 --> 08:11.857
Yeah. Um, so Liv's inside,
J Man. You know, in the house.

08:13.861 --> 08:16.828
I'm not here to see Liv.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.597
I'm here to see you.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.098
Why?

08:20.100 --> 08:25.203
Well, because I thought
we could hang out and talk.

08:25.205 --> 08:28.006
-Like people do.
-Why?

08:29.376 --> 08:31.710
Because I thought
it could be fun.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.246
Why?

08:36.183 --> 08:40.485
Maddie's tough. Luckily,
I'm an actor. I can improvise.

08:40.487 --> 08:43.955
I can also make ordinary
statements sound important.

08:43.957 --> 08:49.528
(exhales) These pretzels
are making me... thirsty.

08:50.697 --> 08:53.298
I need you to teach me
how to play basketball.

08:53.300 --> 08:56.368
-And before you say "why"...
-Why?

08:56.370 --> 08:58.403
It's for next week's episode.

08:58.405 --> 09:01.806
Okay. Can't the show just
get you a coach or something?

09:01.808 --> 09:05.777
-But you're the best in town.
-I'm the best in state!

09:09.983 --> 09:13.318
(laughs)

09:13.320 --> 09:16.888
Uh, yeah, I could
teach you a couple of things.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.824
But, uh, I take basketball
very seriously.

09:19.826 --> 09:20.959
So think fast!

09:23.664 --> 09:25.730
(moaning)

09:25.732 --> 09:27.265
(wheezing) The J Man's
gonna need a minute.

09:32.105 --> 09:34.873
Ah, the Rooney brothers are here
to rid us of our ghost!

09:34.875 --> 09:39.244
You know it!
Couple ghost-hunters, complete
with ghost-hunting equipment.

09:39.246 --> 09:42.714
(laughs) Ah! So...

09:42.716 --> 09:46.084
Have you noticed any paranormal
activity on this set, ma'am?

09:46.086 --> 09:51.456
If so, what,
where, and how scary?

09:51.458 --> 09:54.426
I have heard some
weird moaning, like, uh...

09:54.428 --> 09:58.463
(babbling)

09:58.465 --> 10:00.799
Spooky and unnerving.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.634
It's good to have
fellow believers on set.

10:02.636 --> 10:05.904
Oh. Slow down, sister.
I am no believer.

10:05.906 --> 10:09.240
I'm just here to watch
my brother fail.

10:09.242 --> 10:12.777
And I do enjoy
a snappy jumpsuit.

10:12.779 --> 10:15.914
Well, I got everything
the Internet said
we would need to ghost-hunt:

10:15.916 --> 10:19.751
a temperature gun,

10:19.753 --> 10:22.921
a spirit vacuum trap.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.823
Ooh. What's the rake for?

10:24.825 --> 10:28.326
Oh! Well...
the online store said,

10:28.328 --> 10:32.764
"Those who bought ghost-hunting
equipment also bought rakes."

10:32.766 --> 10:34.799
Huh!

10:34.801 --> 10:38.603
Well, I am tired of having
this ghost disrupt my stage.

10:38.605 --> 10:42.941
So me and my boyfriend

10:42.943 --> 10:44.275
are going to join your hunt.

10:44.277 --> 10:45.944
I didn't know you
had a boyfriend.

10:45.946 --> 10:48.313
He's kind of a celebrity.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.884
Hello, gorgeous!

10:56.823 --> 11:00.825
Someone slap a collar on me
and call me Scooby,
we're gonna catch a ghost!

11:00.827 --> 11:03.361
-(Gemma laughs)
-Wait, wait. Wait, wait.

11:03.363 --> 11:07.565
Johnny, you're dating Gemma?

11:09.936 --> 11:12.937
-It feels right.
-I'll say.

11:12.939 --> 11:16.041
-And ol' Johnny hasn't
been able to stop smiling.
-Oh...

11:16.043 --> 11:19.811
Could be a face twitch,
but I'm thinking it's the girl!

11:19.813 --> 11:21.946
Johnny, look at me.
Closer.

11:21.948 --> 11:24.883
I am crazy-jazzed that
you're into ghost-hunting,

11:24.885 --> 11:29.954
and also, you smell like
a thunderstorm and I love it.

11:29.956 --> 11:31.322
(both laugh)

11:31.324 --> 11:34.025
Okay.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.194
Munch, let's, uh, get
this ghost-hunt started.

11:36.196 --> 11:39.698
Yeah! So, I guess we just

11:39.700 --> 11:42.834
kind of suck the ghost up
in this vacuum trap.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.969
Should be pretty easy.
I mean, we just kind of...

11:44.971 --> 11:48.373
(muffled shouting)

11:52.012 --> 11:53.411
Handy!

11:53.413 --> 11:56.948
Oh, I see why this
is an "also bought."

12:09.996 --> 12:11.896
Okay. Um...

12:11.898 --> 12:14.165
I am confused,

12:14.167 --> 12:18.036
because you look
like a jock,

12:18.038 --> 12:23.174
but you play like a Joey.

12:23.176 --> 12:25.176
I'm no good at basketball,

12:25.178 --> 12:27.512
but I've played baseball
since I was two.

12:27.514 --> 12:31.249
That's cool.
What, uh, what position?

12:31.251 --> 12:34.085
Shortstop. I've got
lightning-quick reflexes.

12:37.057 --> 12:38.923
What was that?

12:38.925 --> 12:42.060
Look, I know I'm terrible,
but I'm a hard worker,

12:42.062 --> 12:45.563
and I've always believed
something worth doing
is worth doing right.

12:45.565 --> 12:49.033
Well, that's cool. That's
actually kinda my mantra, too.

12:49.035 --> 12:52.871
See? We have a mutual mantra.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.007
How cool is that?

12:57.878 --> 13:00.979
Um... what, uh, what's...

13:00.981 --> 13:02.981
What moves do you need to learn?
Like, specifically.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.450
-What happens in the scene?
-The scene?

13:05.452 --> 13:08.753
-Yeah.
-Uh, the scene.
Right, the scene. Uh...

13:08.755 --> 13:12.724
My character has
to expose a coach, who's

13:12.726 --> 13:14.993
actually this alien
with octopus arms,

13:14.995 --> 13:16.961
and, uh...

13:16.963 --> 13:20.131
I have to play him
in a game of one-on-one.

13:20.133 --> 13:23.001
One-on-one? Okay, got it.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.904
So drive to the basket,
and I'll guard you.

13:28.975 --> 13:32.443
(glass shatters)

13:32.445 --> 13:33.745
Hey.

13:35.081 --> 13:36.481
Hey.

13:38.351 --> 13:41.286
So what happens next?

13:41.288 --> 13:44.322
We kiss.

13:44.324 --> 13:48.293
(laughs)

13:48.295 --> 13:51.529
You kiss the coach?

13:51.531 --> 13:55.033
No, no, no. What I meant
to say was, uh, "kick."

13:55.035 --> 13:58.770
You know, I kick
his fake alien head off,

13:58.772 --> 14:01.306
and then I capture
the baby aliens

14:01.308 --> 14:05.076
that crawl out
of his broken head.

14:09.649 --> 14:13.985
Here, ghosty-ghosty-ghosty.
(kissing sounds)

14:13.987 --> 14:17.155
Come here, ghosty.
(kissing sounds)

14:17.157 --> 14:19.190
It's a ghost, not a cat.

14:21.895 --> 14:26.231
We've been doing this
for hours and your equipment
has found nothing.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.699
Speak for yourself, Parker.

14:27.701 --> 14:30.034
I turned my phone
into a hottie detector.

14:30.036 --> 14:33.338
Beep, beep, beep,
beep, beep, beep, beep!

14:33.340 --> 14:36.074
Hottie!

14:36.076 --> 14:39.010
Oh, Johnny, you're too much.
(laughs)

14:39.012 --> 14:41.145
Never stop.

14:42.849 --> 14:44.048
-(banging)
-(all gasp)

14:44.050 --> 14:45.984
Oh, oh, oh!
What was that?! What was that?!

14:45.986 --> 14:49.554
It could be some
spectral action.
Assume ghost formation!

14:56.229 --> 15:00.565
I'm still against this,
but I am a sucker
for a formation, so...

15:00.567 --> 15:02.533
Then let's find these ghosts,

15:02.535 --> 15:06.104
and rock their spirit world.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.841
Okay, now you just
took it too far.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.092
Seriously?

15:32.265 --> 15:34.399
(static hissing)

15:34.401 --> 15:37.302
Okay.

15:37.304 --> 15:40.238
I'm switching to infrared.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.539
Jeeoh!

15:47.614 --> 15:49.814
Oh! I just saw a blurry,
ghost-shaped heat mass!

15:49.816 --> 15:53.217
-Ooh, we're close.
-(beeping)

15:53.219 --> 15:55.119
It's beeping.
My temperature gun is beeping!

15:55.121 --> 15:57.622
Parker, why is my
temperature gun beeping?!

15:57.624 --> 16:00.425
-(beeping stops)
-The temperature dropped
point-two-five degrees in here.

16:00.427 --> 16:04.295
-(gasps)
-Just means that the AC went on.

16:04.297 --> 16:08.499
-(Johnny exhales)
-That's what it means, right?

16:08.501 --> 16:09.834
Right?

16:11.738 --> 16:15.506
Or... we just
entered Ghost Town.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.809
Population: us.

16:26.987 --> 16:29.187
Oh!

16:29.189 --> 16:33.324
Why is LA cheesecake
so much better? Mm!

16:36.196 --> 16:38.262
-Hey, Mom.
-Oh!

16:39.532 --> 16:43.434
I wasn't doing anything.
I was just...
cleaning out my purse.

16:44.771 --> 16:47.071
Oh, look! Found a fork.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.777
Mom, you have to take
that back to the restaurant.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.178
You said that you were
gonna stop doing that.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.151
-Hey, Mads.
-Hey, Liv.

17:00.153 --> 17:05.490
So this <i> Voltage </i> script does
not have a single baby alien

17:05.492 --> 17:08.192
crawling out
of anyone's broken head.

17:09.396 --> 17:12.563
Also, where's the
big basketball scene?

17:12.565 --> 17:14.966
Maddie,
what are you talking about?

17:14.968 --> 17:17.402
There's no big
basketball scene.

17:17.404 --> 17:21.372
Well, Josh asked me
to teach him how to play
basketball for a scene.

17:23.143 --> 17:26.044
Oh!

17:26.046 --> 17:28.646
Yeah! That big basketball scene.

17:28.648 --> 17:32.650
I totes forgot about
that big basketball scene

17:32.652 --> 17:35.920
that Josh is in
with the basketballs.

17:37.223 --> 17:41.325
Uh... Liv, what's going on?

17:41.327 --> 17:43.928
Why would he say
that there's a basketball scene
if there isn't one?

17:43.930 --> 17:49.367
-(squealing softly)
-I mean, he spent all day
with me in the backyard.

17:49.369 --> 17:52.036
You know, just the two
of us playing...

17:52.038 --> 17:55.173
-(squealing)
-Oh.

17:55.175 --> 17:59.377
-Is he my...
-Your secret admirer! Yes!
You figured it out! (laughs)

17:59.379 --> 18:01.746
Whoo! Yay!

18:01.748 --> 18:05.216
<i>♪ Now you can date Josh ♪</i>

18:05.218 --> 18:08.119
-No.
-What?

18:08.121 --> 18:10.354
Why, Maddie?
What's wrong with Josh?

18:10.356 --> 18:12.356
Nothing's wrong with Josh.

18:12.358 --> 18:15.793
It's just... things were
so hard for me with Diggie,

18:15.795 --> 18:18.429
and I'm just not sure that I'm
ready to feel that way again.

18:18.431 --> 18:22.266
Okay, but, Maddie,
how do you know it's even
gonna be like that with Josh?

18:22.268 --> 18:25.736
Liv, how do you know
that it won't be? Okay?

18:25.738 --> 18:29.273
For the last time, butt out.

18:34.314 --> 18:37.215
(humming)

18:43.323 --> 18:45.823
(beeping)

18:48.995 --> 18:53.064
(screaming)

18:53.066 --> 18:55.166
Jonah jumped up
mother of Margaret!

18:55.168 --> 18:58.236
A hungry spirit
has ransacked the kitchen!

18:58.238 --> 19:00.438
Oh, I'm skeptical
about my skepticism.

19:00.440 --> 19:04.442
-Something's got my hand!
-Oh!

19:04.444 --> 19:06.344
That's me, Johnny.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.347
(moaning)

19:09.349 --> 19:12.316
That's that (babbling) sound!

19:12.318 --> 19:14.085
It's the ghost!

19:14.087 --> 19:16.587
It's coming from
the clock tower.
Let's go!

19:19.192 --> 19:21.425
(rapid beeping)

19:21.427 --> 19:22.860
-(beeping stops)
-That's it!

19:22.862 --> 19:24.829
-(moaning)
-That's the ghost shadow
I saw on TV.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.497
Get the spirit
vacuum trap ready!

19:26.499 --> 19:30.268
Really? Me?

19:30.270 --> 19:35.039
Okay. Okay, I'm on it.

19:35.041 --> 19:37.375
(whirring)

19:39.445 --> 19:42.079
Gotcha! Ha-ha! Oh!

19:44.717 --> 19:48.986
Mom? You're
the <i> Voltage </i> ghost?

19:48.988 --> 19:51.956
Mm-hm. Hey, Joey.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.793
I love this cheesecake, Gemma.

19:59.032 --> 20:01.032
I fired Dave.

20:05.972 --> 20:10.541
Maddie! Hi. Okay.
I know that you told me
to butt out of your love life,

20:10.543 --> 20:13.010
but Josh is waiting
for you outside

20:13.012 --> 20:14.812
for his fake
basketball lesson.

20:14.814 --> 20:20.651
-What're you going to do?
-Um, I'm gonna shut this whole
"secret admirer" thing down.

20:20.653 --> 20:22.987
I mean, he wasted my time.

20:22.989 --> 20:26.090
And my very valuable knowledge
of basketball.

20:26.092 --> 20:30.094
Are you sure?
I mean, Maddie,

20:30.096 --> 20:34.065
Josh is a really,
really great guy.

20:34.067 --> 20:37.935
You know? And I know
that you are not ready
to start dating yet.

20:37.937 --> 20:42.440
But if you were,
I actually think that you guys
could be really good together.

20:42.442 --> 20:43.874
I don't know.
He lied to me, Liv.

20:43.876 --> 20:47.545
So that he could
spend time with you!

20:47.547 --> 20:50.248
Would you have spent time
with him if he'd been honest
with you?

20:50.250 --> 20:53.851
-No.
-And did you
have a fun time with him?

20:53.853 --> 20:56.721
Not relevant.

20:56.723 --> 20:59.957
That is totally a yes.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.459
Liv, you're confusing me!

21:01.461 --> 21:04.262
I'm just gonna go out there
and I'm gonna shut it down.

21:07.233 --> 21:10.101
Josh, I have something
to say to you and you're
not going to like it.

21:10.103 --> 21:13.204
Well, if you say it,
Maddie, I'll like it.

21:14.874 --> 21:16.874
(sighs)

21:16.876 --> 21:21.045
(laughs) Wow.

21:21.047 --> 21:24.615
He really is sweet. (chuckles)

21:24.617 --> 21:28.319
So, what is it you
were going to say?

21:28.321 --> 21:30.288
That it's so much fun
coaching me?

21:30.290 --> 21:33.557
No. No!

21:33.559 --> 21:36.761
No. What I was going to say

21:36.763 --> 21:39.964
is that you...

21:39.966 --> 21:43.501
are...

21:43.503 --> 21:48.406
nowhere near ready
for your big basketball scene.

21:48.408 --> 21:50.608
Nowhere. Uh, yeah.

21:50.610 --> 21:52.810
You should just probably
plan on coming here,
like, every day.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.912
'Cause we have a lot
of work to do.

21:54.914 --> 21:58.582
You know, you and me.

21:58.584 --> 22:00.117
Together.

22:00.119 --> 22:02.853
Liv: Yay!

22:04.590 --> 22:07.658
(chuckles)
Can you give me just one sec?

22:10.630 --> 22:14.131
You didn't shut it down!
You cranked it up!
You like Josh!

22:14.133 --> 22:16.567
Stop, don't say anything,
not a word, shut your mouth,
remain silent.

22:22.508 --> 22:25.876
What are you doing
standing around, J Man?!
Let's play some b-ball!

22:27.180 --> 22:29.146
Ha! Caught it.

22:29.148 --> 22:31.215
See? Your lessons
are paying off.

22:31.217 --> 22:32.516
That hurt your hand,
didn't it?

22:32.518 --> 22:33.884
So much.

22:37.824 --> 22:43.027
Karen Rooney
is the <i> Voltage </i> ghost!
Did not see that coming!

22:43.029 --> 22:48.299
Well, I would've gotten away
with it, too, if not
for these meddling kids.

22:48.301 --> 22:52.203
You were sneaking on this set
to eat cheesecake?

22:52.205 --> 22:55.473
You told me you couldn't
make me pancakes anymore

22:55.475 --> 22:57.575
because you didn't
have the time.

22:57.577 --> 23:00.244
But you had all the time
in the world, Mother!

23:02.715 --> 23:06.717
It was Corsun's cheesecake
from LA.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.853
I should come clean.

23:08.855 --> 23:12.757
This cheesecake
isn't from Corsun's.

23:12.759 --> 23:17.161
Shipping it in from LA
is way too expensive.

23:17.163 --> 23:19.697
It's from Larry's
Cheesecake Hut.

23:19.699 --> 23:23.434
You mean that stinkhole
next to the gas station?

23:25.671 --> 23:27.138
Huh.

23:28.741 --> 23:31.709
You just saved me
a pant size.

23:31.711 --> 23:32.843
(Gemma babbling)
