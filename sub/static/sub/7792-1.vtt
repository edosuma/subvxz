WEBVTT

00:33.992 --> 00:37.121
BOTH: And we were born
on September 15...

00:37.204 --> 00:38.672
1989.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.499
And... And she's the older...
Older twin.

00:40.624 --> 00:42.001
I'm older by 10 minutes.
She's... Ten minutes.

00:42.084 --> 00:43.757
Cause she had
an umbilical cord

00:43.835 --> 00:45.303
wrapped around her neck.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.660
And she, like, shoved me in
there and wouldn't let me out.

00:47.714 --> 00:49.216
I was, like, kicking her in,

00:49.299 --> 00:51.097
shoving her more in my mom,

00:51.218 --> 00:53.721
so that's why she came
out, like, later. Yeah.

00:53.804 --> 00:55.522
And... She came out
the bigger twin, too.

00:55.597 --> 00:58.817
Well, I came out a pound
heavier than Kara,

00:58.892 --> 01:00.986
so that's why
I'm an inch taller now.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.280
She's always been,
like, a pound heavier.

01:03.355 --> 01:04.447
No.

01:04.815 --> 01:05.907
So, yeah, it's... You know,

01:05.983 --> 01:07.951
I love being twins, man.
It's, uh...

01:08.026 --> 01:10.279
It's basically like you
have a bag of spare parts.

01:10.362 --> 01:11.443
Yeah. You know what I mean?

01:11.446 --> 01:12.914
It's, like, I need a
kidney down the road,

01:12.990 --> 01:14.992
I know he's got one,
so I'm always like,

01:15.075 --> 01:16.622
"Hey, stay healthy, dude.
Eat right."

01:17.077 --> 01:19.580
When we were kids, we had
our own secret language

01:19.663 --> 01:22.257
that only me and my
brother understood.

01:22.666 --> 01:24.418
Ooh.

01:25.168 --> 01:26.761
Eee.

01:27.296 --> 01:29.219
Ooh.

01:30.799 --> 01:32.919
I guess, when we were kids,
we thought we were whales.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.348
Like, when things are bad,

01:34.428 --> 01:35.771
we don't really got to say
anything to each other.

01:35.846 --> 01:37.439
We just make these sounds.
It's like...

01:37.514 --> 01:39.733
(BOTH GRUNTING)

01:40.559 --> 01:42.561
So, I just graduated
from Harvard,

01:42.644 --> 01:44.396
and I'm starting a new job

01:44.479 --> 01:46.152
at a law firm
in Southern California,

01:46.231 --> 01:48.199
so I'm really happy about that.

01:48.275 --> 01:51.779
And I got a job at Hooters.
I'm happy, too.

01:51.862 --> 01:53.614
(CHUCKLING)
Hooters!

01:53.947 --> 01:56.450
Being a twin is like
being a married couple,

01:56.533 --> 01:57.573
and you can't divorce her.

01:57.618 --> 02:00.792
Even, like! I mean, I love
her when we're together.

02:00.871 --> 02:02.589
Well, actually, more so
when we're distant.

02:02.748 --> 02:04.341
She loves nature, like me.

02:04.416 --> 02:07.386
She loves donating her
time to charities.

02:07.794 --> 02:10.013
And she loves eating healthy,
so that's awesome.

02:10.088 --> 02:11.965
She's my best friend.

02:12.049 --> 02:14.347
My best friend is my boyfriend.

03:33.880 --> 03:37.054

to have such diarrhea?

03:37.634 --> 03:40.558
You need to drink the pink.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.977

03:43.181 --> 03:44.433
Jack, are you watching this'?

03:44.683 --> 03:46.401
What do you mean, "Cut", man?

03:46.476 --> 03:48.353
I... I got to be at
Sesame Street by 1:00.

03:48.478 --> 03:50.572
Hey, hey, hey, Reeg, do
you really have diarrhea?

03:50.647 --> 03:51.694
'Cause you lost weight
or something.

03:51.815 --> 03:53.817
Why does the stomach

Uh-huh.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.328
"Drink the pink." That's funny.

03:56.403 --> 03:57.450
I'm sorry, Jack.

03:57.529 --> 03:59.406
The Dunkin' Donut people
want to talk to us.

03:59.489 --> 04:00.741
Okay, well, I got to

04:00.824 --> 04:01.984
Regis, it's going to be fine.

04:02.033 --> 04:03.834
Yeah, and you'll take
care of that, and, uh...

04:03.869 --> 04:05.746
Thank you very much.
I didn't need that, but cool.

04:05.829 --> 04:07.331
I got some bad news.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.132
We may lose Dunkin' Donuts.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.578
What do you mean "lose"?
They didn't like our pitches?

04:11.710 --> 04:13.007
They want Al Pacino.

04:13.670 --> 04:16.264
- Al Pacino to do a commercial?
- Mmm-hmm.

04:16.423 --> 04:17.640
<i>The Godfather Al Pacino?</i>

04:17.798 --> 04:20.096
They got this new coffee
drink, the Dunkaccino.

04:20.177 --> 04:21.269
Uh-huh.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.346
Dunkaccino, Al Pacino,
they sound alike.

04:23.555 --> 04:23.915
Yes.

04:23.940 --> 04:25.377
Well, they think
it'll be a home run.

04:25.432 --> 04:26.672
Of course
it would be a home run

04:26.725 --> 04:28.245
if he would ever do it,
which he won't.

04:28.310 --> 04:29.482
Yeah, well, never say never.

04:29.561 --> 04:30.858
Remember, you didn't think
we could get Brad Pitt

04:30.937 --> 04:32.359
to do that Radio Shack
commercial.

04:32.689 --> 04:33.781
I was right.

04:34.065 --> 04:35.658
Well, you can't be
right all the time.

04:35.984 --> 04:37.452
- Uh-huh.
- Look, bottom line,

04:37.527 --> 04:40.201
they're going to give us one month to
make this whole Pacino thing happen,

04:40.280 --> 04:41.327
or they're going
to go elsewhere.

04:41.490 --> 04:42.787
We can't lose Dunkin' Donuts.

04:42.866 --> 04:44.163
They're our biggest client.

04:44.242 --> 04:45.664
(SIGHS)
Damn it.

04:45.744 --> 04:47.166
We're going to go
bankrupt, buddy.

04:47.245 --> 04:49.373
And we have 200 employees
relying on us.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.053
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:55.378 --> 04:56.550
What do you think?
Would Al Pacino

04:56.630 --> 04:58.303
ever do a Dunkin' Donuts
commercial?

04:58.507 --> 05:00.430
(LAUGHING)
What?

05:00.592 --> 05:01.718
Yeah.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.474
Shut up.

05:03.553 --> 05:04.930
- Did my wife call?
- Uh, yeah.

05:05.013 --> 05:05.980
You're all set for the cruise.

05:06.056 --> 05:07.353
You guys leave a week
after Hanukkah.

05:07.432 --> 05:09.150
Okay, all right.
There's some good news.

05:09.226 --> 05:10.694
Yeah. She converted, right'?
That's so cool.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.316
She doesn't look Jewish at all.

05:13.230 --> 05:15.324
Wow. That was anti-Semitic.

05:15.774 --> 05:16.900
What? No, I just...

05:16.983 --> 05:18.223
See, I can say that, you can't.

05:18.235 --> 05:19.282
You're not Jewish.

05:19.361 --> 05:20.863
No, but I'm close.

05:21.071 --> 05:22.197
What... What does that mean?

05:22.405 --> 05:23.497
I'm an atheist.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.205
- You're two for two right there.
- What? No...

05:26.284 --> 05:28.002
Anyways, did my sister say

05:28.078 --> 05:29.439
what time she's
flying in tomorrow?

05:29.704 --> 05:30.830
Yeah, I was supposed
to pick her up at noon,

05:30.914 --> 05:32.086
but she switched
the flight to earlier,

05:32.165 --> 05:33.337
so now she gets in
at 4:00 in the morning.

05:33.458 --> 05:34.459
Why?

05:34.584 --> 05:35.756
Something about jet lag.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.801
She never listens.
She gains three hours.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.099
Every year, she acts like
she's flying to New Zealand.

05:41.216 --> 05:42.342
She's a freak, man.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.427
Yeah, again,
you can't say that.

05:44.511 --> 05:45.763
No, I...

- Yeah?

05:55.438 --> 05:56.655
Try complimenting her.

05:56.940 --> 05:58.283
Huh? Yeah. What?

05:58.650 --> 05:59.822
To avoid fighting.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.198
Just focus
on something positive.

06:01.278 --> 06:04.703
Tell Jill that
she has nice shoes.

06:05.448 --> 06:06.825
Nice shoes. That's good.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.000
That'll work.

06:08.451 --> 06:10.328
- I love you, honey.
- I love you, too.

06:10.620 --> 06:11.837
And I love my sister.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.290
And I can keep my cool.

I love my sister.

06:16.626 --> 06:17.843
I love her shoes.

06:17.919 --> 06:19.967
I love my sister.
I love her shoes.

06:27.804 --> 06:28.896

Well, I just...

06:28.972 --> 06:31.066
I can't find him anywhere.

06:31.141 --> 06:33.360
Does he know
what terminal it is'?

06:33.560 --> 06:34.652
I...

06:35.228 --> 06:37.071
Okay, okay, I see him.

06:37.147 --> 06:38.364
All right, I'm hanging up.

06:39.357 --> 06:40.483
How are we doing?

06:40.859 --> 06:42.361
Where were you?

06:42.444 --> 06:44.242
I've been waiting
forever for you.

06:44.321 --> 06:45.868
This place is creeping me out.

06:46.156 --> 06:47.999
Why so many bags?
Are the Knicks traveling with you'?

06:48.074 --> 06:49.435
- What is with this?
- Mom always said,

06:49.451 --> 06:51.012
"it's better to have it
and not need it"

06:51.036 --> 06:52.458
"than to need it
and not have it."

06:52.579 --> 06:53.671
Oh, yeah,
she did say that.

06:53.747 --> 06:54.987
I remember that.
That was cool.

06:55.165 --> 06:56.382
Are you going bald?

06:56.458 --> 06:57.584
- Huh?
- No, no, no, no.

your hair doesn't realize

06:59.669 --> 07:01.044
that it needs
to cover more face.

07:01.045 --> 07:02.343
- Okay.
- Where'd you put the car?

07:03.506 --> 07:05.099
JACK: You really had
to bring your bird?

07:05.175 --> 07:06.301

she's my best friend.

07:06.384 --> 07:07.385
(SQUAWKS)

07:07.510 --> 07:09.478
- Anyways, Jill, I was thinking...
- Yeah?

07:09.679 --> 07:11.119
The house is going
to be very crowded

07:11.181 --> 07:13.183
'cause we got the kids,
and all the guests

07:13.266 --> 07:14.939
are coming by,
and blah, blah, blah.

07:15.018 --> 07:16.736
So, there's this new hotel,

07:16.811 --> 07:17.778
a Hilton that they
just built down...

07:17.854 --> 07:20.277
But I want to spend time
with Sofie and Gary.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.359
Why, do you not want me
to stay with you?

07:22.442 --> 07:24.410
No, no, no, no. Of course
I want you to stay with us.

07:24.486 --> 07:25.726
I was just...
I was just saying.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.580
Okay, I'll stay with you, then.

07:27.864 --> 07:30.538
It's too bad, 'cause the hotel
was starting to sound fun.

07:30.825 --> 07:32.452
(SIGHS)
Why are you doing that?

07:32.535 --> 07:34.082
Why do you sigh so loud?

07:34.412 --> 07:37.040
I just really, really
love your shoes.

07:37.415 --> 07:38.632
You are so weird.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.301
Isn't he weird, Poopsie?

07:40.418 --> 07:42.295
POOPSIE: Where were you?
(LAUGHS)

07:42.671 --> 07:44.264
Poopsie gets it.

07:44.714 --> 07:46.261
Yeah. Poopsie really gets it.

07:46.383 --> 07:48.306
(STRAINED SQUAWKING)
She always did get it.

07:48.385 --> 07:49.386
I... It's just...

07:49.469 --> 07:51.346
She always loved getting it.

07:51.846 --> 07:54.315
And then your dad and I
went to the soup kitchen,

07:54.391 --> 07:55.859
and they gave us Otto

07:55.934 --> 07:58.028
to bring to Thanksgiving
dinner this year.

07:58.895 --> 08:01.068
Thanks again for having me.
It's very nice.

08:01.272 --> 08:03.070
Are you going to eat
dinner with us tonight'?

08:03.358 --> 08:04.484
Yes, he is, honey.

08:04.734 --> 08:05.974
And what about tomorrow night'?

08:06.236 --> 08:08.989
Tomorrow, Otto's going
to go back home...

08:09.072 --> 08:10.073
<i>Less.</i>

08:10.907 --> 08:12.079
Sorry.

Uh, Sofia, show Otto
your karate moves.

08:17.831 --> 08:18.878
(EXHALES)

08:19.332 --> 08:21.412
You know, why don't...
Why don't you go wake up Jill?

08:21.418 --> 08:22.920
- What?
- It's 5:30.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.092
She's here. That's
the important thing.

08:25.171 --> 08:26.297
It counts as a day.

08:26.298 --> 08:28.265
- So what? She's sleeping.
- Jack...

08:28.383 --> 08:30.932
- All right, I'll go check on Jill.
- Thank you.

08:33.722 --> 08:34.974
(SCREAMING)

08:35.056 --> 08:37.024
It's okay, Otto.
It's just her...

08:44.024 --> 08:45.116
(WHISPERING)
Jill.

08:46.276 --> 08:47.903
Wake up.

08:49.070 --> 08:51.493
Okay, stay sleeping.

08:51.573 --> 08:52.745
Jet lag.

08:52.824 --> 08:54.701
- I have a gun!
- Oh, my God!

08:54.826 --> 08:56.328
(SQUAWKING)
(JILL WHIMPERS)

08:56.619 --> 08:58.212
You see, I live alone.

08:58.288 --> 09:01.383
Poopsie's trained
to watch out for me.

09:01.833 --> 09:03.506
Don't sneak up
like that, all right'?

09:03.752 --> 09:05.004
Where were you?

09:05.295 --> 09:06.638
(CHUCKLING)
I don't...

09:07.255 --> 09:09.223
Come downstairs.
Uh, the food's ready.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.593
Can you just lay down
with me for five minutes?

09:11.843 --> 09:13.595
I'm not laying down
with you. No.

09:13.803 --> 09:16.101
Come on. I just want
some twin time.

09:16.306 --> 09:18.525
I'm a grown man.
I'm not laying next to you.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.898
Just have Poopsie lay with you.
I... I don't know.

09:21.269 --> 09:22.771
Aw. All right.

09:23.605 --> 09:26.575
I'll take a bath, and I'll meet
you downstairs in an hour.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.402
(GRUNTS)

09:29.319 --> 09:31.321
Good looking out, Poopsie.

09:32.614 --> 09:34.332
Don't forget your sweat shadow.

09:34.741 --> 09:35.833
What?

09:36.117 --> 09:38.711
All right, just take your
bath and all that stuff,

09:38.787 --> 09:40.835
and then burn those sheets.

09:41.873 --> 09:43.341
(ALL LAUGHING)

09:43.708 --> 09:44.834
Hey, Guys!

09:45.126 --> 09:46.924
Jill! You look amazing.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.597
Aw. Macy's, Marshalls.

09:51.341 --> 09:52.593
Hey, where am I sitting?

09:52.717 --> 09:53.718
What do you mean?

09:53.802 --> 09:55.930
'Cause, usually,
I sit next to you.

09:56.012 --> 09:58.092
So all of a sudden, I'm...
I'm not going to sit here?

09:58.181 --> 10:00.104
Oh, uh, would you...

10:00.183 --> 10:01.504
I thought you could
sit down here.

10:01.518 --> 10:02.610
I always sit next to Jack.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.754
(STUTTERING) Is there a
reason I'm moving?

10:04.778 --> 10:05.229
No.

10:05.230 --> 10:07.278
Jill, if you'd like, you could sit here.
I'd be happy to move.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.701
Oh, that's okay. You're fine.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.870
If you want to... If you...
Do you want to sit here?

10:12.946 --> 10:14.072
I don't know.

10:14.239 --> 10:17.118
Okay, you just sit in my chair.
How's that?

10:17.200 --> 10:18.247
- There you go.
- All right, thank you.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.294
Gary, is that you?

10:20.370 --> 10:21.411
Yes, it is.

10:21.412 --> 10:23.506
- Look how handsome you are.
- Thank you.

10:23.581 --> 10:24.798
It's so nice to see you.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.751
Look at this leaf.
Look at this.

10:26.835 --> 10:28.178
You have it taped on you?

10:28.253 --> 10:29.379
That's so cute. Yes.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.509
Why did he do that?

10:30.588 --> 10:31.840
He likes tape.

10:31.923 --> 10:34.301
Hey. Sofie, is that you,
or is that you?

10:34.551 --> 10:35.803
(JILL LAUGHING)

10:35.885 --> 10:37.558
Good to see you, Erin.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.184
Good to see you, Jill.
How was your flight?

10:39.264 --> 10:40.641
Oh, the house looks amazing.

10:40.723 --> 10:42.270
You got a new chandelier?

10:42.642 --> 10:43.768
Yeah, yeah.

10:43.893 --> 10:45.566
I loved the old one.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.735
- Oh.
- JILL: So,

10:47.814 --> 10:49.987
how's everybody's
Gobble-Gobble Day'?

10:50.066 --> 10:51.818
Great. Excellent.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.738
By the way, Jill,
this is Otto. Otto.

10:54.946 --> 10:56.118
Nice to meet you.

10:56.948 --> 10:58.791
(LOUDLY)
Nice to meet you.

10:59.701 --> 11:02.420
JILL: (WHISPERING)
He's homeless, right?

11:02.996 --> 11:04.873
He seems clean,
but you should put

11:04.956 --> 11:07.334
one of those toilet seat
protectors underneath him

11:07.417 --> 11:10.091
to make sure he doesn't
ruin the chair.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.264
Are you whispering with
a bullhorn or something'?

11:13.339 --> 11:14.761
Everybody hears you.

11:14.966 --> 11:18.015
No, they can't,
Mr. Hearing Expert.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.307
- JILL: So...
- Pass that down, Daddy.

11:22.390 --> 11:23.858
I'm allowed out here
once a year,

11:23.933 --> 11:24.934
so I tend to miss things.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.520
What's going on?
Anything new'?

11:26.728 --> 11:30.449
Well, Sofie just got her
green belt in karate.

11:31.608 --> 11:33.702
How come I didn't
know about this?

11:33.776 --> 11:36.620
I didn't even know she did karate.
What... I mean,

11:37.197 --> 11:39.038
I feel like I'm in the
Twilight Zone right now.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.873
I'm like Jimmy Stewart
at the end of that movie,

11:41.951 --> 11:44.545
the one where... They...
They're in Pottersville.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.589
What... What is that...
That movie called?

11:46.789 --> 11:48.132
<i>It's a Wonderful Life?</i>

11:48.208 --> 11:49.676
No, no, with Jimmy Stewart.

11:49.751 --> 11:52.470
The... The one where he meets
the angel and he's mad.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.593
<i>It's a Wonderful Life.</i>

11:54.672 --> 11:56.094
Why do you keep saying that?

11:56.174 --> 11:58.393
No, the one where
he falls in the pool

11:58.468 --> 12:01.221
<i>and he sings Buffalo Gals.</i>

12:01.304 --> 12:02.897
He gets all the money
at the end,

12:02.972 --> 12:05.942
and he finds out that his
life really is wonderful.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.020
<i>Star Wars.</i>

12:08.811 --> 12:10.529
They play it every Christmas.

12:10.605 --> 12:13.154
You must have saw it before
Jack made you convert.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.635
What? What are you
doing right now?

12:15.068 --> 12:17.162
Your brother didn't
make me do anything, Jill.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.414
Everyone has to be
like Jack over here.

12:19.489 --> 12:20.911
Even poor Gary.

12:21.491 --> 12:23.084
JACK: What?
What does that mean?

12:23.159 --> 12:25.287
You made him switch
from being Indian.

12:25.495 --> 12:26.712
What is wrong with you?

12:26.788 --> 12:28.540
We adopted him when
he was 10 days old.

12:28.623 --> 12:30.000
This is all he knows.

12:30.124 --> 12:33.424
Did you ever think maybe
he tapes things to himself

12:33.503 --> 12:35.756
'cause he doesn't
feel connected?

12:35.838 --> 12:37.806
You know, to his real parents'?

12:38.508 --> 12:40.010
That was very smart.
I just thought of that.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.595
Isn't it? That was interesting.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.563
- Aunt Jill?
- Yes, sweetheart.

12:43.638 --> 12:44.639
Yes, Sofie.

12:44.806 --> 12:46.979
Do you and Daddy
have twin powers?

12:47.225 --> 12:49.603
(STUTTERING) What's this?
What is twin powers?

12:49.686 --> 12:51.279
<i>It's this thing we saw
on 60 Minutes.</i>

12:51.354 --> 12:53.903
Some twins have strange powers,

12:53.982 --> 12:55.702
and they can feel
when the other one's hurt.

12:55.858 --> 12:57.405
Oh, Jack and I can do that.

12:58.861 --> 13:00.955
What? Why are you
making a face?

13:01.030 --> 13:04.034
When we were kids, you felt
it when I broke my ankle.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.373
I felt it 'cause
you fell on my head.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.499
(LAUGHS)

13:07.578 --> 13:08.921
- You like that one?
- Yeah.

13:08.997 --> 13:10.874
- All right, good, good.
- Oh, please!

13:10.957 --> 13:12.800
Tell me you don't feel this.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.382
I didn't feel it.
Maybe if you did it harder.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.430
Little harder.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.100
No, Jill. Stop it.

13:21.175 --> 13:23.052
- He's kidding.
- What?

13:23.344 --> 13:24.846
(GROANING)

13:25.722 --> 13:26.894
Donkey fight!

13:26.973 --> 13:28.896
Jill, are you okay?
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

13:28.975 --> 13:30.898
- Gary, that was...
- He didn't 100% connect.

13:31.102 --> 13:32.319
Feel that, Daddy?

13:32.520 --> 13:34.648
I... I actually did
feel something there.

13:34.731 --> 13:35.857
Pride in my son.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.613
Oh, will you stop it already?

13:37.692 --> 13:40.195
These sweet potatoes need salt.

13:41.029 --> 13:42.576
I'm so sick of that.

13:42.655 --> 13:46.000
Why are you so afraid to
admit that we are connected?

13:46.075 --> 13:47.167
Face it.

13:47.618 --> 13:49.211
We shared Mom's womb.

13:49.287 --> 13:50.755
We were womb-mates.

13:50.913 --> 13:53.086
Oh, that is just disgusting.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.258
ERIN:
I have an idea.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.460
On the show,
there were these twins,

13:55.543 --> 13:56.920
and they finished
each other's sentences.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.346
Jack, maybe you could
start a sentence,

13:58.421 --> 14:00.423
- and Jill, you could finish it.
- No. No.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.133
Come on, Daddy, please!
Please, Daddy, please!

14:02.216 --> 14:03.217
KIDS:
Please. Oh, my God.

Beep, beep, beep, beep,
beep, beep, beep, beep...

14:07.430 --> 14:09.273
All right, will you stop?
You're scaring him.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.147
That's just noises
she's making.

14:11.309 --> 14:13.061
- JACK: Okay, ready?
- Yes.

14:13.519 --> 14:18.776
I'm very tired,
so I'm going to....

14:18.983 --> 14:20.860
Go to the supermarket.

14:21.611 --> 14:23.329
No, I'm going to sleep.

14:23.404 --> 14:25.827
What is... Why would I go to
a supermarket if I was tired'?

14:26.074 --> 14:27.121
That's what I would do.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.543
The cold air
always wakes you up.

14:28.618 --> 14:29.710
Isn't it nice when it's...

14:29.786 --> 14:31.379
You go over there in
the frozen food section?

14:31.454 --> 14:32.797
(SNEEZES)
God bless...

14:32.955 --> 14:34.673
You! God bless you!

14:34.791 --> 14:36.885
I finished your sentence.
Got you, Pagogo.

14:38.127 --> 14:39.379
What's Pagogo?

14:39.462 --> 14:40.509
Oh, it's... It's a name

14:40.588 --> 14:43.068
that Aunt Jill used to call your
dad when they were growing up.

14:43.257 --> 14:46.227
I was Pokee, and your
father was Pagogo.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.304
We had our own secret language.

14:49.472 --> 14:51.395
Ook maga do do, Pagogo.

14:52.016 --> 14:54.064
I have no idea
what those words mean,

14:54.143 --> 14:56.487
nor have I ever known
what those words meant.

14:56.604 --> 14:58.765
You do know what they mean,
and you're lying right now.

14:58.773 --> 15:00.775
"Ook maga do do"
means "I love you."

15:01.150 --> 15:02.652
"Bongi" means "thank you."

15:02.735 --> 15:03.861
"Klapa" means "left."

15:03.945 --> 15:06.448
Hey, do you remember what
"Locky mocky koko" means'?

15:06.948 --> 15:08.621
Mmm. What does it mean again?

15:08.825 --> 15:09.872
Jack, don't.

15:10.034 --> 15:14.005
It means, "I can't
stand you being here!"

15:16.666 --> 15:18.418
This is really awkward.
I'm going to go.

15:18.501 --> 15:20.629
(WHIMPERS)
Dessert is coming.

15:20.753 --> 15:21.754
I'm full.

15:22.839 --> 15:23.931
<i>Okay...</i>

15:24.006 --> 15:26.350
I love how nice we are
to this homeless man,

15:26.426 --> 15:27.678
a person we don't even know,

15:27.760 --> 15:29.762
who probably is pretending
to be homeless!

15:29.846 --> 15:30.938
You don't look homeless to me!

15:31.013 --> 15:32.890
You're fat!
You're al-Qaeda!

(DOOR CLOSES)

15:35.226 --> 15:36.523
Sofia, why don't you
go upstairs?

15:36.602 --> 15:39.196
No, Mom, this is my favorite
part of Thanksgiving.

15:39.564 --> 15:40.941
You know what?
I'm leaving.

15:41.023 --> 15:42.991
I'm leaving. That's it.
That's it. I'm going.

15:43.067 --> 15:44.865
I am going!
I hope you're happy!

15:45.027 --> 15:47.780
I'm sleeping out here
in the woods!

15:47.864 --> 15:49.832
At least the animals
will be nice.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.204
(YELLS)
(POOPSIE SQUAWKING)

15:51.284 --> 15:54.163
Jill! He's even turning
the kids against me!

15:54.287 --> 15:55.767
- Are you okay?
- Jill, are you all right?

15:55.830 --> 15:57.798
No. See, the kids love you.

15:57.874 --> 15:59.876
And I love them.
And that's the only reason

15:59.959 --> 16:02.303
that I come
back here every year.

16:02.587 --> 16:04.214
Jack, apologize.

16:04.714 --> 16:08.389
I'm sorry that you make everybody
uncomfortable. I really am.

16:08.551 --> 16:09.643
Jack.

16:09.719 --> 16:12.142
All right. I'm sorry about
what I said back there.

16:12.221 --> 16:13.939
I didn't mean it.
I... I love you.

16:14.223 --> 16:15.440
I just feel abandoned.

16:15.516 --> 16:16.859
I'm all alone in the Bronx.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.982
I don't have any family
with me any more.

16:19.061 --> 16:20.187
We didn't abandon you.

16:20.271 --> 16:22.649
I told you, you can Skype
us any time you want.

16:22.732 --> 16:24.053
I don't even know
what that means.

16:24.066 --> 16:26.569
What is Skype?
It sounds anti-Semitic.

16:26.652 --> 16:27.653
What is it?

16:27.737 --> 16:28.738
It's just this Internet thing.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.494
I don't get that!

16:30.573 --> 16:33.122
You know I don't
have a calculator.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.710
- (CHUCKLING) Okay.
- ERIN: Do you know what?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.416
Our home is your home.

16:36.579 --> 16:38.923
So let's go back.
I have some ice cream.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.883
I don't know, Erin.

He was more of a gadfly.

25:46.628 --> 25:48.221

I live in the Bronx and
I don't have any children.

33:38.391 --> 33:40.189
In all honesty,
the clock's ticking,

33:40.268 --> 33:41.520
so if dinner works,

33:41.603 --> 33:43.526
we got to get to work.
I'm kidding you.

33:43.605 --> 33:45.983
I just said that 'cause
I'm very nervous right now

33:46.066 --> 33:47.363
and I just keep
talking so much.

33:47.442 --> 33:49.035
My mouth is moving.

33:49.110 --> 33:50.750
I don't even realize
how much it's moving.

33:51.279 --> 33:54.374
It's... I'm not even feeling it.
It's cottony.

33:54.449 --> 33:56.998
So, is this your first date
on mySoul-Mate.net?

33:57.077 --> 33:58.329
Yes.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.714
Assuming it's really happening

34:01.790 --> 34:03.542
and not some sort of
terrifying nightmare.

34:03.625 --> 34:05.002
(CHUCKLES)
I know.

34:05.085 --> 34:06.382
What do you do for a living'?

34:06.461 --> 34:07.508
Don't tell me. I don't want...

34:07.587 --> 34:08.554
<i>I want to play 20 Questions.</i>

34:08.630 --> 34:09.722
Remember that game?

34:09.797 --> 34:11.344
When we were little?
<i>20</i> Questions?

34:11.424 --> 34:13.051
Okay, first question.
Animal, mineral...

34:13.134 --> 34:14.101
I'm going to go
to the bathroom.

34:14.177 --> 34:15.349
<i>Okay...</i>

34:17.138 --> 34:18.139
See you.

34:23.978 --> 34:25.652
Um, should I take away
your salads?

34:26.481 --> 34:30.577
Oh, I think he's just waiting
for his to cool off.

34:30.652 --> 34:33.246
So, we'll just, um...
Just a few more minutes.

34:33.321 --> 34:34.664
Thank you.

34:37.492 --> 34:38.539
(KNOCKING)

34:38.618 --> 34:41.713
Hello? Hello?

34:43.998 --> 34:48.004
Funbucket? Funbucket?

34:50.839 --> 34:52.181
Hello?

35:01.975 --> 35:04.319
He must have gone out
to get some air.

35:15.739 --> 35:16.956
Good job.

35:18.199 --> 35:19.291
You're alive!

35:19.367 --> 35:20.619
How did it go?

35:20.702 --> 35:23.581
Oh, it was... It was fine.

35:23.663 --> 35:25.290
He didn't try anything funny
with you, did he'?

35:25.373 --> 35:26.966
No, no.

35:27.042 --> 35:28.202
Does he want to go out again?

35:28.209 --> 35:29.426
Is he your prince?

35:29.502 --> 35:30.628
Are you his princess?

35:30.712 --> 35:31.804
SOFIA: Did he ask
for your number?

35:31.880 --> 35:33.132
Did he kiss you good night?

35:33.214 --> 35:35.467
(SCREAMING) Oh, will you
kids stop it already?

35:35.550 --> 35:36.927
It was just a date!

35:37.010 --> 35:40.310
Why do you put so much
pressure on me?

35:40.388 --> 35:43.312
(SOBBING) Why are
there so many stairs?

35:43.391 --> 35:46.315
I miss your old chandelier!

35:46.394 --> 35:48.488
No one's ever going to love me!

35:48.563 --> 35:50.156
I'm a loser!

35:50.398 --> 35:53.117
Oh, my God, I'm an idiot.

35:53.193 --> 35:54.319
Why?

35:54.402 --> 35:56.029
Why are you an idiot?

35:57.405 --> 36:01.751
(IN SING-SONG) Busted, disgusted,
never to be trusted.

36:05.914 --> 36:07.131
Hi, Jill.

36:07.374 --> 36:09.217
It's okay, it's...

36:09.876 --> 36:11.674
We've all had bad dates.

36:12.087 --> 36:13.179
Whatever.

36:13.254 --> 36:14.506
He was such a...

36:14.589 --> 36:16.887
I thought he was cool
for a second.

36:17.217 --> 36:18.657
Jack feels like
you deserve to go out

36:18.718 --> 36:20.436
with a guy
who treats you right.

36:20.512 --> 36:21.980
So guess who is taking you

36:22.055 --> 36:23.773
to the Lakers game
tomorrow night.

36:24.474 --> 36:26.772
Hairfingers23 from
the computer?

36:27.435 --> 36:29.938
No, actually, I'm your date.

36:30.438 --> 36:33.112
I love that, Pagogo!

36:33.191 --> 36:34.943
Ook maga do do!

36:35.026 --> 36:36.118
That sounds great.

36:36.194 --> 36:38.322
Finally some twin time.

36:38.405 --> 36:41.659
Oh, pali wali, zoom gali gali.

36:41.741 --> 36:44.540
That means, "I want to
choke on my own vomit."

36:44.619 --> 36:45.666
Does it?

36:45.745 --> 36:46.837
I... I'm a little rusty.

36:46.913 --> 36:48.506
I don't remember everything.

36:48.790 --> 36:51.464
(RAP MUSIC PLAYING)

36:58.133 --> 36:59.806
Oh, my God, look at these guys.

36:59.884 --> 37:01.227
They're huge.

37:01.302 --> 37:02.474
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- They're too big.

37:02.554 --> 37:03.806
- It's freaky.
- Will you stop'?

37:03.888 --> 37:05.060
- It's weird.
- Stop it.

37:05.140 --> 37:06.580
No, it's...
Where do they buy pants'?

37:06.641 --> 37:07.688
Just please keep walking.

37:07.767 --> 37:09.314
I'm sorry.

37:09.394 --> 37:11.271
It's like
nuclear-power-plant big.

37:11.354 --> 37:12.355
That's... That's big.

37:13.440 --> 37:15.317
John, we're so close here.

37:15.984 --> 37:17.452
- Hey.
- You got us in the game.

37:17.527 --> 37:19.325
What's, uh...

37:19.404 --> 37:20.906
What's going on
with the beard, man'?

37:21.281 --> 37:22.328
I'm doing research.

37:22.407 --> 37:23.579
I don't want to be
recognized, okay'?

37:23.825 --> 37:26.203
(CROWD CHEERING)

37:40.508 --> 37:42.101
- Who is that?
- Hey, Jill, don't go nuts,

37:42.177 --> 37:44.100
but I'm gonna try
and talk to Al Pacino.

37:44.179 --> 37:45.522
MAN:
It's Pacino!

37:45.597 --> 37:47.065
Al Pacino, the movie actor?

37:47.140 --> 37:48.767
Yes, yes, stay calm.

37:49.517 --> 37:51.110
What do you think
people are thinking here,

37:51.186 --> 37:52.438
that I'm sitting with my rabbi?

37:52.520 --> 37:54.443
Hey, guys, big game tonight.

37:54.522 --> 37:55.865
Yeah. How you doing, Johnny'?

37:55.940 --> 37:56.941
- How are you?
- Huge fan.

37:57.025 --> 37:58.242
Good to see you. Thank you.

37:58.318 --> 37:59.786
And, uh, Mr. Pacino,

37:59.861 --> 38:02.080
I actually met you one
time at a movie premiere.

38:06.493 --> 38:07.790
He's thirsty.

38:07.869 --> 38:09.086
<i>Okay...</i>

38:09.162 --> 38:10.584
<i>It was Cats & Dogs 3,</i>

38:10.663 --> 38:13.086
and we were sitting
in the same row.

38:13.166 --> 38:14.846
One of your kids
knocked over your popcorn,

38:14.876 --> 38:16.423
and I gave you mine.

38:16.503 --> 38:18.756
And you called me "Popcorn"
the rest of the night.

38:18.838 --> 38:20.090
Popcorn.

38:20.173 --> 38:22.050
- Yes.
- Yeah, nice to see you again.

38:22.258 --> 38:23.475
Hey, what's with the beard?

38:23.551 --> 38:25.224
You look a little
like Bin Laden.

38:25.804 --> 38:27.884
- I was kind of thinking Castro, myself.
- (LAUGHS) Yeah.

38:27.889 --> 38:29.106
No, no, it's like

38:29.182 --> 38:31.184
the cough drops guy,
the Smith Brothers.

38:31.684 --> 38:33.652
Who is that?
Is that your wife'?

38:33.728 --> 38:35.150
No, no, no, that's
my sister Jill.

38:35.230 --> 38:36.447
She's in from the Bronx.

38:36.523 --> 38:38.116
Hey, Al, do you think
you'd ever...

38:38.191 --> 38:39.191
Dulcinea.

38:39.234 --> 38:40.281
What's that?

38:40.360 --> 38:41.407
You're from the Bronx?

38:41.486 --> 38:42.487
Yeah, born and bred.

38:42.570 --> 38:43.822
Throggs Neck, the nice part.

38:43.905 --> 38:45.065
Al, I got a question for you,

38:45.073 --> 38:46.194
and I know it's a long shot.

38:46.241 --> 38:47.458
Well, I'm from the Bronx.

38:47.534 --> 38:48.660
- Oh, okay.
- Did you know that?

38:48.743 --> 38:50.623
Yeah, to be honest, I don't
know much about you.

38:50.662 --> 38:52.084
I haven't seen
a lot of your movies,

38:52.163 --> 38:53.631
but I hear you're very serious.

38:53.706 --> 38:55.504
- Well, you know...
- Okay.

38:55.583 --> 38:56.800
Hey, is Ryan Seacrest here?

38:56.876 --> 38:58.237
Have you seen him?
Do you know him?

38:58.419 --> 38:59.887
I'm sorry, who-crest?

39:00.088 --> 39:01.568
Al, would you ever
consider doing a...

39:01.631 --> 39:03.633
Eh, who is your friend?
Was he in Duran Duran?

39:03.716 --> 39:04.716
Were you in Duran Duran?

39:04.759 --> 39:06.887
Yes. Yes, I was.

39:07.428 --> 39:09.556
So, tell me, how long are
you gonna be in L.A.?

39:09.764 --> 39:11.373
Oh, my God.
Is that John Stamos?

39:11.398 --> 39:11.836
Who?

39:12.100 --> 39:14.023
Pagogo, Pagogo, let's
go before he gets away!

39:14.102 --> 39:15.695
I want to see him
up close! Please!

39:15.770 --> 39:17.317
Oh, so, Al,
I'm gonna get a hold

39:17.397 --> 39:18.398
of your agent, if that's cool.

come out?

39:58.605 --> 40:00.528

I can't believe this.

40:00.607 --> 40:02.109
This is insane, man!

40:02.191 --> 40:04.239
- You got to call him!
- Oh, cool your buns.

40:04.319 --> 40:07.163
You know I'm still hurting from
the whole Funbucket fiasco.

40:07.238 --> 40:08.740
No, but Pacino liked you!

40:08.823 --> 40:10.746
I swear to God,
he really liked you!

40:11.159 --> 40:12.456
Oh, will you stop already?

40:12.535 --> 40:15.254
You know all he wants to do is
play Twister with your sister.

40:15.622 --> 40:17.716
Jill, will you just
do this for me?

40:17.790 --> 40:20.919
You know, maybe I'll be ready
to date again in a few weeks.

40:21.002 --> 40:22.845
We'll sit and talk about
it on New Year's.

40:23.296 --> 40:24.639
(TIRES SCREECHING)

40:27.967 --> 40:29.560
New Year's?

40:29.636 --> 40:31.434
But you're not gonna
be here on New Year's,

40:31.512 --> 40:32.792
'cause that's
after our birthday.

40:33.014 --> 40:34.607
Which is when you're leaving.

40:34.682 --> 40:36.810
Yeah. Uh, I guess so.

40:37.310 --> 40:40.063
- So, if New Year's comes up...
- Mmm-hmm.

40:40.146 --> 40:42.069
Just tell Jill that
one more passenger

40:42.148 --> 40:43.900
on the cruise ship, it'll sink.

40:43.983 --> 40:45.109
I'm not telling her that.

40:45.193 --> 40:47.070
Tell her... You got
to tell her something.

40:47.153 --> 40:48.279

come to Europe.

very time, you were born.

- Okay.

So how does it feel, old man?

you guys, too.

It's just, every year, I'd
go with Mom to Valentino's.

where my mother met my father.

going to be big.

42:22.582 --> 42:24.550
To me, that seems too much,
almost like a job.

42:24.625 --> 42:25.717
I couldn't do that.

42:25.793 --> 42:27.045
- I don't eat that many.
- No?

42:27.128 --> 42:28.801
Okay, okay,
here's the situation.

42:28.963 --> 42:31.011
You're here, there's
not a Subway in sight.

42:31.090 --> 42:32.387
You're at a steakhouse
like this.

42:32.467 --> 42:33.844
What do you eat?
What do you eat'?

42:33.926 --> 42:35.553
- I eat other things.
- Oh, you do'?

42:35.636 --> 42:36.728
You do'? I knew
you were cheating.

42:36.804 --> 42:38.602
That's why there's so
much goo left on you.

42:38.931 --> 42:40.023
What?

42:40.099 --> 42:41.351
I miss the old Jared,

42:41.434 --> 42:43.402
the 400-pound Jared
that scared us.

42:43.478 --> 42:44.650
I don't miss that one at all.

42:45.146 --> 42:47.399
Well, I'm sure you don't.
But if he was around, he'd be with me

42:47.482 --> 42:48.779
and not with the two hookers.

42:52.403 --> 42:53.764
JILL: Well, yeah,
we love musicals.

42:53.821 --> 42:55.038
You know what?

42:55.114 --> 42:56.411
You're the Sham-Wow man, right?

42:56.491 --> 42:57.993
- Yeah.
- Funny story.

42:58.159 --> 43:00.787
- Uh, Jack used to be a bed-wetter.
- MEN: No!

43:00.870 --> 43:02.918
He could have used one
of these Sham-Wow things

43:02.997 --> 43:04.715
20 years ago for
his pee puddles.

43:04.791 --> 43:06.384

43:10.129 --> 43:11.676
BILLY: Where you
going, Puddles?

43:12.632 --> 43:15.101
All right,
nice to meet you all.

43:15.176 --> 43:17.474
Am I crazy or is she hot?

43:18.012 --> 43:19.104
You're crazy.

43:19.347 --> 43:21.224
IRVIN:
It's Jack with boobs.

43:21.307 --> 43:23.105
Jack with boobs. That's right.

43:23.184 --> 43:24.481
There he is!

43:25.186 --> 43:27.109
Dude, did you set
this whole thing up'?

43:27.188 --> 43:28.348
Yeah, we got through it, man.

43:28.356 --> 43:29.636
It came out pretty dope,
I think.

43:29.649 --> 43:31.196
It's amazing. Hey, Jill.

43:32.193 --> 43:33.786
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Come here for a sec.

43:33.861 --> 43:35.113
Okay, nice to see you.

43:35.196 --> 43:36.573
What's going on?

43:36.656 --> 43:38.579
Did I ever tell you
Todd is an atheist?

43:38.866 --> 43:39.867
A what?

43:40.159 --> 43:41.411
Oh, God.

43:41.494 --> 43:42.746
(CHUCKLES)
Have a great time, guys.

43:42.829 --> 43:44.957
No. How could
there be a Grand Canyon

43:45.039 --> 43:46.461
if God didn't exist?

43:46.541 --> 43:48.088
Right. (STUTTERS)
That's a very good point.

43:48.167 --> 43:49.635
I'm just saying,
you know, maybe...

43:49.710 --> 43:53.135
Maybe God wouldn't have given you a
rat face if you believed in him.

43:53.214 --> 43:54.306
I don't have a rat face.

43:54.382 --> 43:56.009
Yes, you do have a rat face!
It's scary.

43:56.092 --> 43:57.469
McENROE: Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

43:57.552 --> 43:58.519
This guy doesn't
believe in God?

43:58.594 --> 43:59.641
No!

43:59.720 --> 44:00.972
No, no, I'm just saying

44:01.055 --> 44:02.602
that there's not real proof.

44:02.682 --> 44:05.982
Idiots like you
really make me mad!

44:37.091 --> 44:38.718
- There's not enough candles for both of us.
- All right, Jill.

44:39.051 --> 44:40.849
One cake's enough.
Make the wish.

44:41.888 --> 44:43.640
Mom and Dad always
got us two cakes.

44:44.557 --> 44:46.480
Made us both feel special.

I never know where I am.

45:20.593 --> 45:21.719
It's a wilderness here.

45:21.802 --> 45:23.850
I mean, in the Bronx,

45:23.930 --> 45:25.853
you got the streets,
you got the numbers.

45:25.932 --> 45:28.230
You got 187th, 188th.

45:28.309 --> 45:29.856
Yeah, right, in order.
It follows in sequence.

45:29.936 --> 45:32.280
Here, you got the palm trees,
and they all look alike.

45:34.523 --> 45:36.491

- I don't.

I got the panic button.

45:43.115 --> 45:45.493
Yeah, and we'll soon find
out where we are, huh?

45:45.993 --> 45:47.836
(ALARM BLARING)

45:49.163 --> 45:50.881
There we go. That's a house.

45:50.957 --> 45:52.083
That's not a bakery.

in a bakery, a house,

45:53.417 --> 45:54.418

45:54.502 --> 45:55.674
It makes a difference!

45:55.962 --> 45:57.885
- What do you mean?
- There's a bakery in the house.

45:57.964 --> 45:59.432
Get out of town! Come on.

45:59.507 --> 46:01.009
I'm not going to your house.

46:01.175 --> 46:02.768
I want to see
a birthday cake soon

46:02.843 --> 46:04.766
or I'm taking pepper spray out.
I'm not kidding.

46:07.765 --> 46:09.392

46:09.558 --> 46:11.105
No, that was Jesus.

who he thinks is his
lost love Dulcinea.

46:56.856 --> 46:58.108
Right.

46:58.190 --> 46:59.783
And he can't
straighten his back,

46:59.859 --> 47:01.281
so he keeps ringing the bell.

47:01.360 --> 47:02.452
And he has a sidekick.

47:02.528 --> 47:03.996
It was a mouse.

47:17.251 --> 47:19.299
- Oh.
- Come with me a second.

47:19.378 --> 47:20.846
Let me just eat some cake.
This is so good.

47:20.921 --> 47:22.343

47:29.388 --> 47:32.016

stick with two hands, right?

47:32.099 --> 47:33.191
And you're going to hit it.

47:33.267 --> 47:35.315
Do I have to play
this weird game?

47:35.394 --> 47:37.567
It's not weird.
Jill, it's in you.

This is the heavy, hard stuff
or how are we doing here?

¡Qué lindo!</i>

01:08:45.246 --> 01:08:46.372
That's enough for me.

01:08:46.538 --> 01:08:47.586
Who's Poopsie?

01:08:47.665 --> 01:08:49.337
I keep hearing,
"Poopsie, Poopsie."

01:08:49.751 --> 01:08:51.252
Poopsie is my bird.

01:08:51.544 --> 01:08:52.841
Ah?

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:54.091
I used to raise pigeons.

01:08:54.671 --> 01:08:55.969
Really? Yeah.

01:08:56.049 --> 01:08:57.676
No, I'm sorry. That was Brando.

01:08:58.051 --> 01:09:00.520
Oh!
(GIGGLES)

01:09:01.595 --> 01:09:02.643
Are you ticklish?

01:09:02.721 --> 01:09:03.723
No.

01:09:04.057 --> 01:09:05.649
- Oh!
- I said I'm not, so...

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:06.850
No, no, it's just that

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:10.234
Stella Adler, the great acting
teacher, once wrote in a book,

01:09:10.563 --> 01:09:13.692
the only way you can really get
to know somebody is if you,

01:09:13.774 --> 01:09:17.120
uh, watch their behavior
when they're being tickled.

01:09:17.487 --> 01:09:18.658
Would you do me the honor

01:09:18.738 --> 01:09:20.615
and just lift up
those girlie arms'?

01:09:20.907 --> 01:09:24.332
I just haven't shaved under
there in many, many years.

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:25.377
You don't want to see that.

01:09:25.453 --> 01:09:27.171
We're in Europe.
It doesn't matter.

01:09:27.246 --> 01:09:29.499
I think even here, they might
be, like, "What is that?"

01:09:29.582 --> 01:09:32.631
No, no, not here.
Give me a try.

01:09:32.877 --> 01:09:34.002
Okay, so, here we go.

01:09:34.587 --> 01:09:35.804
Oh, my God.

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:37.256

Just... (MIMICKING JILL) I don't really...
I didn't like that.

01:09:54.732 --> 01:09:56.029
- I'm sorry.
- That was powerful.

01:09:56.109 --> 01:09:58.282
And it just came out
of you like, "Boom!"

Whoa. Whoa!

01:10:07.453 --> 01:10:09.251
I don't even know
where Jack is right now.

01:10:09.330 --> 01:10:12.254
He's avoiding me.
That's where he is.

01:10:12.458 --> 01:10:13.630
Can I work in with you guys?

01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:15.799
Sure. Knock yourself out.

01:10:16.295 --> 01:10:18.718
I think he hates
'cause I talk so much.

01:10:18.798 --> 01:10:20.641
It bothers him, you know?

01:10:21.092 --> 01:10:22.435
But when I'm in the Bronx,

01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:24.888
I have no one else
to talk to but Poopsie,

01:10:24.971 --> 01:10:28.646
so when I'm around other humans, I...
I tend to blab a lot.

01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:30.898
- No, you don't.
- I do, I do.

01:10:30.977 --> 01:10:33.230
Will you throw
a couple more 45s on'?

01:10:33.312 --> 01:10:35.110
Erin, he was being
so nice to me,

01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:37.032
and then I had to
bring up the Pacino thing,

01:10:37.108 --> 01:10:38.325
because. I don't know.

01:10:38.401 --> 01:10:41.371
I do that. It's just 'cause
I'm insecure, you know'?

01:10:41.446 --> 01:10:44.996
I feel like the only reason
he brought me on this cruise

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:47.497
is for some Pacino-related
shenanigans

01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:49.170
and it just gets in my head.

01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:50.963
He told me he wanted you
to come on this cruise

01:10:51.038 --> 01:10:53.132
because he didn't want you to
spend your first New Year's Eve

01:10:53.207 --> 01:10:54.459
without your mom alone.

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:56.336
He said that?

01:10:56.836 --> 01:10:57.837
Yeah.

01:10:59.589 --> 01:11:01.933
Oh, my God, that
means so much to me.

01:11:02.175 --> 01:11:05.304
Why didn't I use my twin
powers to know that?

01:11:05.386 --> 01:11:07.935
Do they not work when
you're out of the country'?

01:11:08.181 --> 01:11:09.228
Maybe they don't.

01:11:09.515 --> 01:11:11.313
That's why he was mad!

01:11:11.392 --> 01:11:14.191
'Cause he was being good to me, and I...
I did what I did

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:16.113
and I'm a jerk,
and I have to call him.

01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:18.570

all he got all his life

was everything.

receive it all.

he doesn't love you.

it's a kind of deathbed love,

the kind of love he'll look
back on when it's too late.

<i>so I got to lose two seconds.</i>

01:25:22.409 --> 01:25:24.127
Maybe you can tell me what,
what part you would lose,

01:25:24.202 --> 01:25:26.546
but I think we are
getting there.

01:25:27.873 --> 01:25:29.045
Burn this.

01:25:29.625 --> 01:25:30.717
I'm sorry?

01:25:32.836 --> 01:25:36.932
This must never
be seen by anyone.

01:25:37.299 --> 01:25:39.927
If you didn't like all those
close-ups, we can, we can...

01:25:40.010 --> 01:25:41.136
This is not the final cut.

01:25:41.219 --> 01:25:42.266
There's no doubt,
we can, we can...

01:25:42.346 --> 01:25:43.723
All copies.

01:25:45.849 --> 01:25:47.099
Destroy them.

01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:48.693
- You want me to play it again?
- Has anybody seen this?

01:25:48.769 --> 01:25:50.146
Nobody has seen this.

01:25:50.228 --> 01:25:52.196
They have to be found
and talked to.

01:25:52.272 --> 01:25:54.775
All right, to be honest,
I showed my wife.

01:25:54.858 --> 01:25:57.236
- (CHUCKLING) She couldn't believe...
- No good, no good.

01:25:58.654 --> 01:26:00.782
So I used to be fatter,
and so what he would do...

01:26:00.864 --> 01:26:02.616
Picture him way bigger, like...

01:26:02.699 --> 01:26:04.997
So what would happen is we'd
get together on Thanksgiving.

01:26:05.077 --> 01:26:06.557
He'd kind of gather
the family around,

01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:08.918
and, and so I would have to go,

01:26:09.456 --> 01:26:11.800
"This is me before
Ultra Slim Fast."

01:26:11.875 --> 01:26:13.548
"And this is me now!"

01:26:13.627 --> 01:26:14.867
And everybody
would laugh at him

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:16.241
and he'd go cry
in the other room.

01:26:16.338 --> 01:26:18.511
I'm Larry, this is
my brother Dave.

01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:21.764
We used to be triplets,
but he ate the other one.

01:26:23.095 --> 01:26:24.438
Let me tell you, I don't,
I don't really like getting

01:26:24.513 --> 01:26:25.685
into fights with him
because I really...

01:26:25.764 --> 01:26:27.516
I don't like closing
my fist on him,

01:26:27.599 --> 01:26:28.680
so when we get into fights,

01:26:28.684 --> 01:26:30.186
we look like sissies
when we fight each other.

01:26:30.268 --> 01:26:32.066
You know, 'cause I don't,
I don't really like...

01:26:32.145 --> 01:26:33.863
It's kind of that...
The schoolyard fight

01:26:33.939 --> 01:26:34.986
when you see two girls.

01:26:42.906 --> 01:26:44.267
She's my baby girl,
she knows that.

01:26:44.282 --> 01:26:45.875
We're like a husband-and-wife
relationship.

01:26:45.951 --> 01:26:47.544
- We fight and then we come together.
- That's sick, okay?

01:26:47.619 --> 01:26:49.087
- I mean, not in a sick way.
- You shouldn't say that

01:26:49.162 --> 01:26:50.802
like that, that's sick.
Not in a sick way.

01:26:51.289 --> 01:26:52.916
I don't like my brother.

01:26:52.999 --> 01:26:55.752
I have a deep, intense
dislike for my brother.

01:26:55.836 --> 01:26:56.883
He's a bad guy.

01:26:57.295 --> 01:26:58.512
I know what the problem is.

01:26:58.588 --> 01:27:01.057
He didn't say anything
about it, did he?

01:27:01.133 --> 01:27:04.808
He don't like the mustache
'cause he can't grow one.

01:27:05.303 --> 01:27:06.771
Well, usually, when we
celebrate a birthday,

01:27:06.847 --> 01:27:08.087
usually it's more
than one cake.

01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:09.107
- It's four cakes.
- It's usually four.

01:27:09.182 --> 01:27:10.399
Yeah. It's usually four cakes.

01:27:10.475 --> 01:27:12.694
There's right hand, left
hand, right hand, left hand.

01:27:12.769 --> 01:27:14.237
Or one for me and one for him

01:27:14.312 --> 01:27:15.393
and two for his girlfriend.

01:27:15.439 --> 01:27:16.486
Yeah, yeah.

01:27:16.648 --> 01:27:17.695
She was actually living in L.A.

01:27:17.774 --> 01:27:20.072
And I was in Kentucky doing
the race at that moment.

01:27:20.152 --> 01:27:21.404
- I was tired.
- Yeah.

01:27:21.486 --> 01:27:22.578
'Cause I did not
train properly.

01:27:22.654 --> 01:27:23.655
And I started feeling,
like, these pains

01:27:23.739 --> 01:27:25.741
or something like that, and
it was, like, weird, so...

01:27:25.824 --> 01:27:26.493
So, yeah.

01:27:26.518 --> 01:27:29.193
I mean, that's my part
of, like, ESPN or ESP.

01:27:29.244 --> 01:27:30.370
- Whatever it's called.
- It's ESP.

01:27:30.454 --> 01:27:32.456
- Okay, whatever.
- ESPN is the network for sports.

01:27:32.831 --> 01:27:34.424
(BOTH SPEAKING SECRET LANGUAGE)

01:27:37.627 --> 01:27:39.004
You figure it out.

01:27:39.296 --> 01:27:40.923
Well, you know,
I'm married, so...

01:27:41.006 --> 01:27:42.098
Yeah, we don't
have girl issues.

01:27:42.174 --> 01:27:43.300
Yeah, well, I...
Sometimes, though,

01:27:43.383 --> 01:27:45.010
I do try to hook him up
with someone.

01:27:45.093 --> 01:27:46.253
I mean, if they come up to me

01:27:46.261 --> 01:27:48.605
and they're like, they like
me, I'm like, "Oh, sorry,"

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:50.933
and then I'm like, "Hey,
look at this guy, though."

01:27:51.016 --> 01:27:54.486
And so, I mean, he's kind
of like the backup twin.

01:27:54.561 --> 01:27:55.858
I don't care, I take it.

01:27:56.104 --> 01:27:57.321
I said, "Look, dude,
I don't think I can..."

01:27:57.397 --> 01:27:58.694
"I don't think
I can go on this date,"

01:27:58.774 --> 01:28:00.902
"but I can't,
can't break the date."

01:28:00.984 --> 01:28:03.078
"'Cause, you know,
it's got to happen,"

01:28:03.153 --> 01:28:04.530
"it's got to happen tonight."

01:28:04.613 --> 01:28:05.705
I said, "Well,
Rog, you know..."

01:28:05.781 --> 01:28:06.828
You said... What'd you...
What'd you tell me?

01:28:06.907 --> 01:28:08.627
"How does the girl look?
How does she look?"

01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:10.077
I said, "Dude, she's
a 10, she's hot."

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:11.628
- "She's hot?"
- "She's hot."

01:28:12.204 --> 01:28:13.376
I said, "Well,
you know, send me."

01:28:13.455 --> 01:28:16.925
"I'll put, I'll put her on
ice for the night, you know."

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.253
"Send me out, I'll make sure
everything's good for you,"

01:28:19.336 --> 01:28:21.338
"you know, and you'll be
good to go next week."

01:28:21.421 --> 01:28:22.923
So I did.
He went out with the girl.

01:28:23.006 --> 01:28:24.053
It was smooth, right?

01:28:24.132 --> 01:28:26.009
She... I think she fell in love
with him on the first date.

01:28:26.092 --> 01:28:28.345
What's funny is, my brother
ended up dating this girl

01:28:28.428 --> 01:28:29.850
for, like, four...
What, like three and a half years?

01:28:29.930 --> 01:28:30.977
Yeah, it was like
three and a half years.

01:28:31.056 --> 01:28:33.730
She never knew we switched
on the very first date.

01:28:33.809 --> 01:28:36.010
She said, "The best time of
my life was the first date."

01:28:36.019 --> 01:28:38.272
- There you go.
- I was like, "Oh, come on."

hair, full Afros.
