17:43.363 --> 17:45.830
[ hisses ]
g-g-g-give me my jade!

17:45.832 --> 17:47.698
Give me my jade! Okay.
[ panting ]
okay.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.367
[ panting ] whew!

17:49.369 --> 17:51.035
Oh! [ exhales deeply ]

17:51.037 --> 17:52.737
[ continues panting ]
okay, fine.

17:52.739 --> 17:55.573
I guess superstition is real
if you believe in it.

17:55.575 --> 17:59.010
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
I told eddie to lie.

17:59.012 --> 18:00.211
[ exhales deeply ]

18:00.213 --> 18:01.512
I'll get rid of the bull.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.848
We're gonna have to do
a lot more than that.

18:03.850 --> 18:06.217
We've invited bad luck
into our home.

18:06.219 --> 18:09.420
It's on us.
It's on the kids.

18:09.422 --> 18:12.090
[ sighs ] I don't know
how to fix it.

18:12.092 --> 18:15.059
I know who does.

18:15.061 --> 18:20.364
<i>[ mystical music playing ]</i>

18:20.366 --> 18:21.999
Mom, we need to talk to you.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.371
Huh?
[ door closes ]

18:27.373 --> 18:30.541
Uh, sorry, mom. We just
really needed to talk to you.

18:32.711 --> 18:34.879
We have invited bad luck
into our home,

18:34.881 --> 18:37.281
And we need you
to get rid of it.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.854
How did you know?

18:45.057 --> 18:46.157
Ah.

18:48.160 --> 18:50.161
[ high-pitched voice ]
"give me my jade!

18:50.163 --> 18:51.929
Give me my jade!"

18:51.931 --> 18:54.999
[ school bell rings ]

18:55.001 --> 18:56.734
Hey, eddie.

18:56.736 --> 19:00.671
Any fallout from that
whole emotional jam session?

19:00.673 --> 19:02.673
What?
How are you feeling?

19:02.675 --> 19:05.610
Oh. Well, my parents
grounded me for lying.

19:05.612 --> 19:07.411
At least
I'm still president.

19:07.413 --> 19:10.982
And I'm psyched for
the free period. Naps 101!

19:10.984 --> 19:12.283
Yeah, about that --

19:12.285 --> 19:14.118
Apparently, that free period
is actually

19:14.120 --> 19:17.021
A "go to the principal's office
and lick envelopes" period.

19:17.023 --> 19:18.990
<i>What?</i>
<i>Budget cuts.</i>

19:18.992 --> 19:20.658
They need the student body
to pitch in.

19:20.660 --> 19:24.795
I thought this job was gonna be
all about naps and shaq.

19:24.797 --> 19:27.698
Maybe he'd playfully put me
on his shoulders,

19:27.700 --> 19:30.034
Or let me stick both of my feet
into one of his shoes.

19:30.036 --> 19:31.435
I don't know.

19:31.437 --> 19:32.770
Yeah, I'm sorry, man.

19:32.772 --> 19:35.606
I'm new here.
Apparently, this place sucks.

19:35.608 --> 19:39.010
I guess it's just
our bad luck.

19:39.012 --> 19:41.979
[ whispers ] bad luck.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.181
[ grandma chanting in mandarin ]

19:43.183 --> 19:45.049
<i>Eddie: So grandma went into</i>
<i>the zodiac books,</i>

19:45.051 --> 19:46.551
<i>Called up some aunties,</i>

19:46.553 --> 19:49.854
<i>And performed a ritual</i>
<i>to take away our bad luck.</i>

19:49.856 --> 19:51.155
[ whispers ]
is this gonna work?

19:51.157 --> 19:54.025
[ whispers ] shh!
Let her concentrate!

19:55.394 --> 19:58.196
Wow. These people have
some crazy traditions, right?

19:58.198 --> 19:59.664
Bananas.
[ clatter ]

19:59.666 --> 20:01.299
Oh!

20:01.301 --> 20:03.067
[ scoffs ] raining salt?

20:03.069 --> 20:05.036
Too bad it's not raining men!

20:05.038 --> 20:06.404
Ugh!

20:06.406 --> 20:08.406
Right, girls?
[ inhales sharply ]

20:14.513 --> 20:18.149
Why'd you make us buy all those
garfield mugs for the ceremony?

20:18.151 --> 20:19.584
You didn't even use them.

20:25.824 --> 20:28.926
Well, I'm glad we all
got through that as a family.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.861
And now we can put
this chapter behind --

20:30.863 --> 20:32.063
You are still grounded.

20:32.065 --> 20:33.864
[ scoffs ] you hard, woman!

20:33.866 --> 20:36.067
Eddie, don't call
your mother "woman."

20:37.603 --> 20:39.770
Garfield should have a mug
that says "naps 101."

20:39.772 --> 20:41.072
[ glasses clink ]
[ giggles ]

20:46.044 --> 20:48.346
So your company's set up
in delaware,

20:48.348 --> 20:50.681
But <i>you</i> live in florida.

20:50.683 --> 20:53.284
[ ball bounces ]
the tax man can't touch you.

20:53.286 --> 20:54.719
[ sighs ] that's great.

20:54.721 --> 20:57.555
You know, I'm always looking for
a loophole -- breakaway!

20:57.557 --> 20:59.924
[ laughs ]

20:59.926 --> 21:02.927
I did it!
I scored on scottie pippen.

21:02.929 --> 21:05.963
[ laughs ]
I was giving you tax advice,
bro.

21:07.366 --> 21:09.066
[ grunts ]

21:09.068 --> 21:11.035
It's not shaq's shoe,

21:11.037 --> 21:12.803
But I guess it'll do.

21:12.805 --> 21:16.340
Y'all are a rude-ass family.
[ ball bounces ]

21:17.876 --> 21:20.044
Scottie? Mr. Pippen!

21:20.046 --> 21:23.648
Mr. Pippen! Mr. Pippen!

21:23.650 --> 21:24.915
[ sighs ]

21:24.917 --> 21:27.218
I gotta stop drinking water.
