00:01.369 --> 00:03.537
ANNOUNCER: Thanks for
downloading this Fox show.

00:03.571 --> 00:05.739
And don't miss
all-new episodes on Fox.

00:07.608 --> 00:09.643
Previously on Empire...
It's the devil's chord.

00:09.677 --> 00:12.246
And she told me you didn't
even want to use it.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.248
CANDACE: Do you love Angelo?
COOKIE: I think so.

00:14.282 --> 00:15.916
Think?
I don't want to lose him.

00:15.949 --> 00:17.351
And that's why I have to come
clean about what happened.

00:17.385 --> 00:18.919
No, no, no, no, no.

00:18.952 --> 00:20.588
You just went Cookie crazy.

00:20.621 --> 00:21.889
TV REPORTER:
We are prepared

00:21.922 --> 00:23.491
to call the Democratic
mayoral primary

00:23.524 --> 00:25.259
for Angelo Dubois.

00:25.293 --> 00:26.727
We'd like to know when
you're gonna find the time

00:26.760 --> 00:28.196
to wear this wire.

00:28.229 --> 00:30.531
Get Tariq to fess up
to all his illegal tactics.

00:30.564 --> 00:31.999
I've been working
on an investment deal

00:32.032 --> 00:34.102
for Empire artists in Las Vegas.

00:34.135 --> 00:36.604
Why don't you play the song
you wrote for me, Lucious.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.939
You tell me why I shouldn't kill
you right where you're standing.

00:44.212 --> 00:46.214
*

01:15.509 --> 01:17.578
I think you might be
the only person

01:17.611 --> 01:19.913
that's ever played
this old piano.

01:19.947 --> 01:21.315
Who knows? Maybe it was put here

01:21.349 --> 01:24.218
just so I could write a song
about you.

01:24.252 --> 01:27.288
* Oh, euphoria *

01:27.321 --> 01:30.057
* I'm so glad I found you *

01:30.090 --> 01:33.627
* How you changed my life *

01:33.661 --> 01:36.597
* To a sky so blue, ah *

01:36.630 --> 01:39.066
* 'Cause you crept in my heart *

01:39.099 --> 01:41.569
* Turned my whole world apart *

01:41.602 --> 01:43.337
* Your love is all *

01:43.371 --> 01:47.107
* I need *

01:47.141 --> 01:49.477
* Hey, hey *

01:49.510 --> 01:51.445
* Mountains high *

01:51.479 --> 01:55.449
* With the valley low *

01:55.483 --> 01:58.286
* She can make a man
lose all control... *

01:58.319 --> 01:59.687
That's hot.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.088
Who's it for?

02:01.121 --> 02:03.090
Nobody.

02:03.123 --> 02:07.361
Just a 15-year-old demo
that I never quite finished.

02:09.029 --> 02:12.433
"Crazy, Crazy 4 U"?

02:12.466 --> 02:15.469
I was a bit of a romantic then.

02:15.503 --> 02:18.272
Was it before or after
you divorced me?

02:18.306 --> 02:19.707
Does it matter?

02:19.740 --> 02:21.209
I mean, we both know that love

02:21.242 --> 02:23.744
and romance is all bull, right?

02:26.180 --> 02:27.748
Well, it's hot.

02:31.852 --> 02:33.354
Thank you.

02:33.387 --> 02:36.123
But don't worry,
I'm not gonna put it on Inferno,

02:36.156 --> 02:37.858
or nothing like that.

02:37.891 --> 02:41.329
I mean, you and Jamal got
that corny sentimental corner

02:41.362 --> 02:42.963
locked up with that

02:42.996 --> 02:45.032
When Cookie Met Lucious.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.970
So... so, what's up, Cook?

02:50.003 --> 02:53.374
I need to run something by you.

02:53.407 --> 02:56.344
But, uh, you know what,
now might not be the time.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.045
What are you talking about?
You're already here.

02:58.078 --> 03:00.248
Might as well spit
the damn thing out.

03:02.283 --> 03:04.752
(sighs)

03:06.754 --> 03:09.323
Well...
(clears throat)

03:09.357 --> 03:11.759
Angelo...

03:11.792 --> 03:16.730
has been hinting that, uh,
if he wins the primary,

03:16.764 --> 03:18.399
he would propose to me.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.036
And he won it.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.242
Good.

03:28.276 --> 03:32.780
Maybe you and him will have a
much smoother ride than we did.

03:36.817 --> 03:40.254
So, you're not gonna try
and burn it down if I say yes?

03:40.288 --> 03:43.291
Uh...
(sighs)

03:43.324 --> 03:45.859
whatever you and him got,

03:45.893 --> 03:48.796
it ain't nothing
compared to what we had.

03:48.829 --> 03:51.399
I mean, y'all ain't

03:51.432 --> 03:54.268
torn up a room,
let alone a whole damn building.

03:54.302 --> 03:57.237
But if he asks you

03:57.271 --> 04:01.642
and you do say
yes, um...

04:02.676 --> 04:04.478
I'll fall back.

04:07.281 --> 04:09.317
Have you spoken
to the boys about it?

04:09.350 --> 04:12.620
I plan on talking to them next.

04:12.653 --> 04:15.289
Good.

04:15.323 --> 04:17.124
'Cause you and me,
we need to have

04:17.157 --> 04:20.127
a "coming to Jesus" moment
with Andre about...

04:20.160 --> 04:21.495
this whole Vegas deal.

04:21.529 --> 04:25.399
Vegas is moving ahead,
Lucious, what--

04:25.433 --> 04:27.000
why do you want to kill it?

04:27.034 --> 04:31.339
Because this woman
Andre is dealing with is...

04:31.372 --> 04:33.206
a very dangerous woman.

04:36.009 --> 04:38.011
*

04:43.016 --> 04:45.085
Where the hell is Tory?

04:45.118 --> 04:46.286
We need to get Nessa on point

04:46.320 --> 04:47.287
before that gaming
commissioner gets here.

04:47.321 --> 04:48.589
SHINE:
Why are we even dealing

04:48.622 --> 04:51.258
with a junkie ex-pop star,
anyway?

04:51.291 --> 04:54.161
Because that junkie ex-pop
star is a genius songwriter,

04:54.194 --> 04:55.996
and that's what
Nessa needs.

04:56.029 --> 04:57.931
Look, guys,

04:57.965 --> 04:59.433
the head of the Vegas
Gaming Commission

04:59.467 --> 05:01.702
has flown out here
as a personal favor to me.

05:01.735 --> 05:04.372
We're gonna have to
present facts, figures,

05:04.405 --> 05:07.074
revenue projections and hit
songs by our headliner.

05:08.376 --> 05:09.810
If Commissioner Frost
doesn't think

05:09.843 --> 05:12.279
this is a viable
enterprise, guess what.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.047
We get no gaming license.

05:14.081 --> 05:15.849
And you know
what that means?

05:15.883 --> 05:17.785
We are sunk from jump.

05:17.818 --> 05:18.886
Does that make sense?

05:19.887 --> 05:21.455
You're two hours late.

05:21.489 --> 05:23.491
Oh, shoot,
I meant to make it three.

05:24.558 --> 05:26.059
GIULIANA:
Hello,

05:26.093 --> 05:27.294
I'm Giuliana.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.729
My friends call me Giusi.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.964
(chuckles)
We're not friends.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.500
(clears throat)
Let me guess,

05:32.533 --> 05:34.502
you were a big fan of
my generic pop anthems.

05:34.535 --> 05:36.003
They made you
feel empowered.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.472
No, actually,
I liked your first EP,

05:38.506 --> 05:40.641
Rat Juice.
Back when it felt

05:40.674 --> 05:42.643
like you were actually
singing for something.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.077
It's too bad.

05:44.111 --> 05:46.213
I don't perform anymore.
It kills my sobriety.

05:47.715 --> 05:48.816
ANDRE:
Tory,

05:48.849 --> 05:50.718
we want you
to write a song for Nessa,

05:50.751 --> 05:52.553
for a show she's doing
in Las Vegas.

05:53.954 --> 05:57.157
That could actually be
kind of cool.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.393
Unfortunately,
Lucious has me

05:59.427 --> 06:00.761
under lock and key
for Inferno.

06:00.794 --> 06:02.262
GIULIANA: Well, maybe
you and Lucious

06:02.295 --> 06:04.364
can do something together.
ANDRE: No.

06:05.298 --> 06:06.366
Hell no, that's not happening.

06:08.802 --> 06:11.238
You know, I would
really appreciate it

06:11.271 --> 06:13.006
if you don't interrupt
me when I'm speaking,

06:13.040 --> 06:14.475
because I actually
know what I'm doing.

06:16.744 --> 06:19.780
(scoffs) Co-- uh, Andre,
come on, man. What is this?

06:21.415 --> 06:22.783
It was Giusi, right?
Yeah.

06:24.251 --> 06:25.753
Maybe we could be friends.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.921
I'm sure that I could
sneak one past Lucious.

06:27.955 --> 06:29.256
I like the way you think.

06:29.289 --> 06:30.858
TORY: Just give
me a day or two,

06:30.891 --> 06:32.225
I have a couple of things
I've been working on.

06:32.259 --> 06:33.393
Great.

06:35.429 --> 06:36.430
(sighs)

06:36.464 --> 06:38.766
What is it... with you

06:38.799 --> 06:40.534
and my father?

06:40.568 --> 06:42.302
I saw you trying to talk to him
the other night.

06:42.335 --> 06:44.104
What's going on?

06:44.137 --> 06:45.973
We met a long
time ago.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.975
I saw him the other night,
he didn't remember me,

06:48.008 --> 06:50.043
so clearly I didn't leave
much of an impression.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.912
SHINE: Well,
for future reference,

06:51.945 --> 06:54.281
me and Andre is doing this deal.

06:54.314 --> 06:55.583
We don't need Lucious.

06:55.616 --> 06:56.784
GIULIANA:
Okay, Shiny.

06:56.817 --> 06:58.952
Calm down. I got it.

07:00.654 --> 07:02.656
(funky instrumental playing)

07:08.496 --> 07:09.997
Hey, you know
where a brother can get

07:10.030 --> 07:11.398
one of them
Coocious T-shirts at?

07:11.431 --> 07:12.800
(laughing):
You stupid.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.802
I don't think
that's suitable

07:14.835 --> 07:16.804
for the next mayor
of New York, my friend.

07:16.837 --> 07:19.773
Yeah, you're probably right.

07:19.807 --> 07:22.510
One step at a time, though.

07:22.543 --> 07:25.012
One step at a time.

07:25.045 --> 07:26.346
And speaking of steps...
(clears throat)

07:26.379 --> 07:29.182
I am about to take
a pretty big one.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.018
Um, and I don't--

07:31.051 --> 07:33.854
I don't want to put a foot wrong
with your moms.

07:33.887 --> 07:36.156
So, I figured that I would

07:36.189 --> 07:37.791
come and-and
speak with you first.

07:37.825 --> 07:39.159
(clears throat)

07:39.192 --> 07:40.794
Wait,

07:40.828 --> 07:43.697
you-- you asking me for
my mother's hand in marriage?

07:43.731 --> 07:45.866
(laughing): You-- how did...
Angelo,

07:45.899 --> 07:47.835
that's amazing. Really?
But one step at
a time, though.

07:47.868 --> 07:50.704
I'm-I'm actually here
to ask you if--

07:50.738 --> 07:53.006
i-if I should ask her.
Yes!

07:53.040 --> 07:55.442
Hell yes.
Why would you even hesitate?

07:55.475 --> 07:56.977
Well--
(chuckles)

07:57.010 --> 07:59.379
well, for starters...

07:59.412 --> 08:00.848
No. No, no,
no, no, no.

08:00.881 --> 08:02.650
Come on. Look.

08:02.683 --> 08:06.053
Old pictures, old news, a'ight?

08:06.086 --> 08:08.789
Coocious is over.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.058
For real?
I'm telling you.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.394
Okay.

08:14.427 --> 08:16.864
(sighs)
Okay.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.231
(laughs)
That's...

08:18.265 --> 08:20.033
that's all
I really wanted to hear.

08:20.067 --> 08:22.469
That's amazing, man.
Wait, wait, wait, hold up, look.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.805
Look, a little advice,
all right?

08:24.838 --> 08:27.074
Stop.

08:27.107 --> 08:30.210
You know, with the whole
"one step at a time" thing.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.980
My mom is the one,
so get her.

08:33.013 --> 08:36.784
She likes showmanship, drama,
big gestures, so bring it.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.688
Of course.

08:40.721 --> 08:44.024
Okay. Good looking out.

08:44.057 --> 08:46.026
Stepdaddy.
(laughs)

08:46.059 --> 08:47.728
(door opens)

08:47.761 --> 08:49.830
I'm putting all of Empire's
department heads to work.

08:49.863 --> 08:53.066
Wardrobe, PR,
Art Department, everybody.

08:53.100 --> 08:56.103
Wow, that sounds
pretty damn ambitious.

08:56.136 --> 08:58.038
I mean, something of
that size would require

08:58.071 --> 09:00.741
approval of both CEOs, and
nothing came across my table.

09:00.774 --> 09:02.442
Did you cosign
something like that?

09:02.475 --> 09:03.677
No, I did not.

09:03.711 --> 09:06.413
Andre, you gonna introduce me?

09:06.446 --> 09:08.148
Ma, this is
Giuliana Green.

09:09.449 --> 09:10.884
I thought you two
met the other night.

09:10.918 --> 09:13.921
No. I was too busy
celebrating Angelo's win.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.288
But I feel like we met.

09:15.322 --> 09:16.890
Not that I recall.

09:16.924 --> 09:18.892
Lucious, you haven't
changed a bit.

09:18.926 --> 09:20.527
You look

09:20.560 --> 09:22.495
almost as good as when we met.

09:24.431 --> 09:26.433
*

09:29.336 --> 09:31.538
* I was like, good gracious,
ass is bodacious, uh *

09:31.571 --> 09:33.974
* Flirtatious,
trying to show faces *

09:34.007 --> 09:36.877
* I'm waiting for the right time
to shoot my steez *
* You know *

09:36.910 --> 09:38.478
* Waiting for the right time
to flash them keys *

09:38.511 --> 09:40.480
* Then, um, I'm leaving *

09:40.513 --> 09:41.581
* Please believin', oh *

09:41.615 --> 09:43.951
* Me and the rest
of my heathens *

09:43.984 --> 09:46.053
* Check it, got it locked at
the top of the Four Seasons *

09:46.086 --> 09:47.888
* Penthouse, rooftop,
birds I'm feeding *

09:47.921 --> 09:49.556
* No deceiving,
nothing up my sleeve and *

09:49.589 --> 09:51.792
* No teasing *

09:51.825 --> 09:54.461
* I need you to get up,
up on the dance floor... *

09:54.494 --> 09:56.329
My name's Lucious.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.565
As if everyone in here
doesn't know who you are.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.000
Then, what's the problem?

10:00.033 --> 10:02.135
I mean,
you saw me looking at you.

10:02.169 --> 10:03.336
Why you walk away?

10:03.370 --> 10:04.805
Well, time is money.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.740
Maybe I decided
you're not worth my time.

10:06.774 --> 10:08.742
(laughs)

10:08.776 --> 10:10.978
You about as shady
as you are beautiful.

10:11.011 --> 10:12.079
What's your endgame?

10:12.112 --> 10:13.981
I'm my own endgame.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.649
CROUPIER:
Spin coming up.

10:15.683 --> 10:17.117
You look a little
trepidatious.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.619
Excuse me, let me show you
how the big boys do it.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.188
CROUPIER:
Place your bets,
ladies and gentlemen.

10:21.221 --> 10:22.189
This is for you.

10:22.222 --> 10:23.523
No more bets, please.

10:23.556 --> 10:25.125
No more bets.

10:25.158 --> 10:26.694
* What good is all the fame *

10:26.727 --> 10:27.995
* If you ain't (gasps)
the models? *

10:28.028 --> 10:29.296
* I see you drivin'
sports cars *

10:29.329 --> 10:30.798
* Ain't hittin'
the throttle... *

10:30.831 --> 10:31.999
(crowd cheers)

10:32.032 --> 10:33.600
Winner, double zero.

10:33.633 --> 10:34.968
* Exit 106 and parked it *

10:35.002 --> 10:37.170
* Ashtray, flip gate,
time to spark it *

10:37.204 --> 10:38.605
* Gucci collar for dollar... *

10:38.638 --> 10:41.141
Ain't I gonna get
a thank you kiss or nothing?

10:41.174 --> 10:42.843
(chuckles)
I'll bet you don't know
the difference

10:42.876 --> 10:45.045
between a biased wheel
and a house edge.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.847
Teach me.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.349
* You're with a winner,
so, baby, you can't lose... *

10:49.382 --> 10:51.018
I'm Giuliana.

10:51.051 --> 10:54.054
My friends call me Giusi.

10:54.087 --> 10:56.623
Well, I'm going to call you
Giuliana.

10:56.656 --> 11:00.227
Because we're going to be
much more than friends.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.229
* It's getting hot in here. *

11:03.430 --> 11:04.732
COOKIE:
Wait.

11:04.765 --> 11:06.533
You two know each other?

11:06.566 --> 11:08.335
We met...

11:08.368 --> 11:09.803
once...

11:09.837 --> 11:11.404
a long time ago.

11:11.438 --> 11:14.041
I'm surprised Rafael
let you leave Vegas.

11:14.074 --> 11:17.010
I mean, normally, he keeps
a tight-ass leash on you.

11:18.111 --> 11:19.780
He knew Rafael?

11:21.281 --> 11:24.151
Who's Rafael?
Rafael is...

11:24.184 --> 11:26.954
Why is Shine referring
to Rafael in past tense?

11:29.957 --> 11:31.825
Rafael Green

11:31.859 --> 11:33.894
was a big player
in Vegas.

11:33.927 --> 11:36.897
A very corrupt, ruthless,

11:36.930 --> 11:39.566
and despicable
human being.

11:39.599 --> 11:43.036
Giuliana is-- or,
I'm sorry, was-- his wife.

11:43.070 --> 11:44.772
And therefore
under no circumstance

11:44.805 --> 11:46.506
will my business

11:46.539 --> 11:48.175
or my family
have anything

11:48.208 --> 11:49.476
to do with her.

11:52.445 --> 11:53.847
Mm.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.715
I know we've met.

11:55.749 --> 11:57.284
Andre, we'll talk.

12:06.659 --> 12:07.961
* If it's love
that you're running from... *

12:07.995 --> 12:09.462
JAMAL: Ma, this
from the place in Flatbush?

12:09.496 --> 12:11.698
Mm-hmm.
I thought
they hated you.

12:11.731 --> 12:15.035
No, you know I can't stay mad
at them Jamaicans for too long.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.770
Love that
jerk chicken.

12:16.804 --> 12:19.206
Look, baby, I ordered
extra plantains.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.408
I know how much
you love 'em.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.310
Okay, cool.

12:26.446 --> 12:29.549
All right, boy, let it out.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.251
Let what out?

12:31.284 --> 12:33.220
Keem, you
stopped talking

12:33.253 --> 12:35.155
the moment I mentioned
marrying Angelo.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.724
So you're in your feelings about
something. Let's talk about it.

12:37.757 --> 12:38.826
Ma, I don't care.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.460
You are so obvious, man.

12:40.493 --> 12:42.595
I'm too old to be having
a stepfather, okay?
Oh.

12:42.629 --> 12:45.298
Goodness. Hakeem, brother,
you need to grow up, for real.

12:45.332 --> 12:46.333
You grow up.
No, 'cause it's not

12:46.366 --> 12:47.901
about you, it's not about me.

12:47.935 --> 12:49.669
It's about Mom
and her happiness.

12:49.702 --> 12:51.238
Thank you.
I'm saying it's
about damn time

12:51.271 --> 12:52.806
that she got through with Dad

12:52.840 --> 12:54.707
and she found herself
a good dude.

12:55.809 --> 12:56.776
Hear, hear.

12:56.810 --> 12:58.011
All I know is,
the last track on

12:58.045 --> 12:59.412
When Cookie Met Lucious
is gonna be

12:59.446 --> 13:01.081
about our mother
finding happiness,

13:01.114 --> 13:03.483
the happiness that her father
dreamed for her.

13:03.516 --> 13:05.752
That's amazing.
That's what's important.

13:05.785 --> 13:09.389
Thank you, Mal.
That's so sweet.

13:12.492 --> 13:16.096
So that means I have
your support, too, Andre?

13:16.129 --> 13:18.665
I'm in full support
of you, Mom.

13:18.698 --> 13:20.767
And, in turn,

13:20.800 --> 13:22.970
I want you to support
my Vegas deal,

13:23.003 --> 13:25.438
no matter how hard
Lucious pushes against it.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.440
And now it's about you.

13:27.474 --> 13:30.143
Hey, I'm asking all
of you to back me.

13:30.177 --> 13:31.711
It's a big opportunity.

13:31.744 --> 13:33.813
Giuliana's club's gonna be
the perfect spot for us.

13:33.847 --> 13:36.016
Hakeem, you can do
a residency in Vegas.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.551
And I know how important it is
to both of you to beat Inferno.

13:38.585 --> 13:39.819
So what about this?

13:39.853 --> 13:41.654
What if

13:41.688 --> 13:43.891
we launch a visual album
on XStream,

13:43.924 --> 13:45.558
with a party in Vegas?

13:45.592 --> 13:47.494
I'm proposing
all of that,

13:47.527 --> 13:50.397
for all of us, to the gaming
commissioner in a few days.

13:50.430 --> 13:53.166
That goes well,

13:53.200 --> 13:57.337
we will have broken into a town
Dad's been too afraid to crack.

13:57.370 --> 14:01.041
*

14:07.280 --> 14:08.916
THIRSTY:
I-It just seems weird.

14:08.949 --> 14:11.551
She didn't say anything else
about Rafael?

14:11.584 --> 14:14.321
We could've had
this conversation

14:14.354 --> 14:15.555
between the two
of us, Lucious.

14:15.588 --> 14:17.657
And you never spoke
to him? Not once?

14:17.690 --> 14:20.227
I already told you.
No, Thirsty.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.162
Now, the only reason
I'm not smacking you out

14:22.195 --> 14:24.998
of that "buy one, get one free"
suit you got on right now is out

14:25.032 --> 14:26.333
of respect
for Lucious.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.268
But you keep comin' at me
like that...

14:28.301 --> 14:31.404
Thirsty is the eyes in the back
of my head in this place.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.540
And if he's asking you
questions, it's 'cause

14:33.573 --> 14:34.741
I'm asking them.

14:34.774 --> 14:36.076
BECKY:
Lucious, holy...

14:36.109 --> 14:39.112
I'm sorry,
am I interrupting something?

14:39.146 --> 14:40.847
Yeah, we're in the middle
of something right now.

14:40.880 --> 14:44.251
Well, I'm sorry. It's just that
I'm in the studio with Tory,

14:44.284 --> 14:46.553
and you have to hear this.

14:46.586 --> 14:49.022
(sighs)

14:49.056 --> 14:52.025
Listen, I mean, the
only reason that I'm...

14:52.059 --> 14:56.429
not gonna read anything
into you referring to this dude

14:56.463 --> 14:58.298
as in the past tense

14:58.331 --> 15:01.701
is 'cause I'm taking you
on your word, Shine.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.937
Just do me a favor and
find out what really happened

15:03.971 --> 15:05.438
with this dude, man.

15:05.472 --> 15:06.873
You got it.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.608
Thank you, boss.

15:10.277 --> 15:12.245
* And if you're waiting for me
to stop *

15:12.279 --> 15:14.581
* You gon' be stickin'
to the clock like glue *

15:14.614 --> 15:17.284
* 'Cause I'm the kind of girl
that wants the spotlight *

15:17.317 --> 15:20.453
* And the big dreams, you do it,
I can do it better *
* Hey *

15:20.487 --> 15:24.324
* I can, yeah *
* And when you aim high
and you dive deep *

15:24.357 --> 15:25.625
* There ain't nothing
that can measure *

15:25.658 --> 15:28.095
* 'Cause I'm-a keep on *

15:28.128 --> 15:29.662
* Keep on giving till I get it *

15:29.696 --> 15:32.232
* Because I just might take
the world *

15:32.265 --> 15:35.402
* And I'm-a play it
till I win it *

15:35.435 --> 15:37.904
* Because I just might be
the girl *

15:37.937 --> 15:39.439
* To play the world *

15:39.472 --> 15:42.475
* Whoa... *

15:42.509 --> 15:44.677
* I might play your world *

15:44.711 --> 15:48.181
* Whoa... *

15:48.215 --> 15:50.683
* I might play the world. *

15:50.717 --> 15:52.185
(music stops)
Hey, uh, Brandon,

15:52.219 --> 15:53.586
let's take that next bit up

15:53.620 --> 15:54.988
and see if Nessa can hit it,
all right?

15:55.022 --> 15:56.456
So, this was just
supposed to be a demo,

15:56.489 --> 15:58.458
but do you hear
those vocals?

15:58.491 --> 16:01.361
Look at you, Miss Becky
with the Good Damn Ear.

16:01.394 --> 16:04.431
I mean, nobody in the world
would ever suspect

16:04.464 --> 16:07.000
that Tory Ash
is a soul singer.

16:07.034 --> 16:10.003
A white girl like that
blowing through black pipes,

16:10.037 --> 16:12.439
that's money for Empire.
I know.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.174
What I could do is
I could take this

16:14.207 --> 16:16.609
and polish it up and release
it on Empire XStream.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.611
And that's what
you're gonna do.

16:18.645 --> 16:22.282
Except Andre commissioned this
demo for Nessa's Vegas show.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.951
Really?
Yeah.

16:24.984 --> 16:28.355
Well, that's not a problem.
That's a solution to a problem.

16:28.388 --> 16:30.823
Look, this is what
we're gonna do.

16:30.857 --> 16:32.659
You're gonna
release this tonight.

16:32.692 --> 16:35.662
We're gonna get Hakeem
and Tiana to introduce it.

16:35.695 --> 16:37.830
I mean, I think they'll enjoy
serving up a little

16:37.864 --> 16:39.332
karmic retribution

16:39.366 --> 16:41.034
for Andre and Miss Nessa.

16:41.068 --> 16:42.535
* To play the world *

16:42.569 --> 16:46.339
* Whoa... *

16:46.373 --> 16:47.974
* I might play the world. *

16:48.007 --> 16:49.409
*

16:54.714 --> 16:57.084
(knocking)

17:07.427 --> 17:09.229
Hey.
Come on in.

17:09.262 --> 17:12.099
I was careful. Trust me.

17:19.939 --> 17:22.175
(crying)
COOKIE:
Aw, you up already?

17:22.209 --> 17:24.444
Come on, come on, I know.

17:24.477 --> 17:26.213
Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.581
Yes, indeed.
You come on over here.

17:28.615 --> 17:29.849
Shh, now, be quiet.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.784
We need to listen
in on something.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.086
If you can't keep her quiet,

17:33.120 --> 17:34.354
I can hold her-- I want to...
Hush up.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.388
I don't want to miss this.

17:35.422 --> 17:36.756
She not even fussing.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.591
You just make sure
boo boo kitty does

17:38.625 --> 17:40.193
what boo boo kitties do.

17:40.227 --> 17:41.261
"Boo boo kitty."
I ain't heard you

17:41.294 --> 17:42.629
say that in a while.

17:42.662 --> 17:45.365
Yeah, well, I'm
in a good mood today.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.967
ANIKA (over computer):
So, this is, um...

17:48.000 --> 17:49.369
this is where all the...
the magic happens, huh?

17:49.402 --> 17:51.771
You hear your mommy?
It's going down.

17:51.804 --> 17:54.040
What magic?

17:54.073 --> 17:56.876
You know, the, um...

17:56.909 --> 17:59.479
solving the
cases and stuff.

17:59.512 --> 18:00.980
(clears throat)

18:01.013 --> 18:03.583
You seem a bit nervous.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.886
Are you scared of Lucious,

18:06.919 --> 18:08.488
or are you scared of me?

18:08.521 --> 18:10.390
(chuckles)

18:10.423 --> 18:13.626
No, Tariq. No,
it's just, um...

18:13.660 --> 18:15.462
I'm just wondering if
maybe we might be

18:15.495 --> 18:16.763
making a mistake.

18:16.796 --> 18:20.467
Now, it's only a mistake

18:20.500 --> 18:22.335
if you try to play a brother.

18:22.369 --> 18:23.936
ANIKA (scoffs):
No.

18:23.970 --> 18:26.673
The truth is,
you're all I've got right now.

18:26.706 --> 18:28.408
I mean, you know what kind
of animal

18:28.441 --> 18:29.742
I'm dealing with here.

18:29.776 --> 18:32.078
(chuckles)
She never lied about that.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.847
Because your granddaddy
is a savage beast.

18:34.881 --> 18:37.083
Don't be telling her that.
Yes, he is. It's the truth.

18:37.116 --> 18:40.220
Yeah, you're in a tight spot.

18:43.055 --> 18:45.292
But you serve Cookie up
on a platter,

18:45.325 --> 18:47.260
they'll lift my suspension.

18:47.294 --> 18:48.495
Suspension?

18:48.528 --> 18:50.029
But I...

18:50.062 --> 18:51.764
I didn't know that
you were suspended.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.466
How can you protect me
if you're suspended?

18:53.500 --> 18:55.034
This is gonna get me
reinstated.

18:55.067 --> 18:56.303
TARIQ:
Trust me.

18:56.336 --> 18:58.037
Well, that's a wrap
on his ass.

18:58.070 --> 18:59.506
Are you sure?

18:59.539 --> 19:01.774
You can't work on a case
while you're suspended.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.211
I mean, Thirsty can get him
thrown out of the FBI

19:04.244 --> 19:05.345
and thrown in jail.

19:05.378 --> 19:07.280
Hmm.

19:07.314 --> 19:11.017
Anika stepped up for us.

19:11.050 --> 19:13.520
Yeah.
I got to give her
props for that.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.555
And she gave us Bella.
(Cookie chuckles)

19:15.588 --> 19:16.589
(phone buzzing)

19:18.891 --> 19:20.960
Oh, take her.
That's Angelo.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.662
Come here.
Come to Granddaddy.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.163
Hello.

19:24.197 --> 19:25.365
Uh, how come
I'm at your apartment

19:25.398 --> 19:27.400
right now, and you are not?

19:27.434 --> 19:29.502
Uh, something came up.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.070
Okay, you remember I told you
I needed to speak to you

19:31.103 --> 19:33.206
about something, right?
All right,

19:33.240 --> 19:34.874
why are you getting so testy?

19:34.907 --> 19:36.409
Well, be-because it's important.

19:36.443 --> 19:38.211
Tell me now.
Cookie, face to face.

19:38.245 --> 19:39.812
That's how important news
is delivered.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.013
Okay, you ain't got to get

19:41.047 --> 19:42.382
all gangsta on me.

19:42.415 --> 19:43.650
(chuckles)

19:43.683 --> 19:45.852
I'll come right now.

19:45.885 --> 19:48.054
Well, apparently Angelo

19:48.087 --> 19:49.656
has something he has
to tell me now.

19:49.689 --> 19:50.657
I-I have to go.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.024
Sounds like he's about

19:52.058 --> 19:53.360
to propose to you.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.362
You think so?

19:55.395 --> 19:58.831
Probably, so you might want
to get over there

19:58.865 --> 20:01.368
before he change his mind.

20:02.569 --> 20:03.736
Now that, um,

20:03.770 --> 20:05.872
Anika's stepped up
to the plate,

20:05.905 --> 20:07.340
you gonna make her
family again?

20:07.374 --> 20:10.243
She was never family.

20:10.277 --> 20:12.379
We're just kind of freaky
together, you know?

20:12.412 --> 20:13.613
That should work out
fine for you,

20:13.646 --> 20:14.681
'cause you ain't nothing
but a freak.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.082
(chuckles)

20:16.115 --> 20:17.450
Well, you're the one
that taught me.

20:17.484 --> 20:19.252
(sighs):
Shut up.

20:19.286 --> 20:20.920
There's only been
two women

20:20.953 --> 20:23.222
who could deal
with you, Lucious,

20:23.256 --> 20:25.124
and that's been me
and Anika.

20:25.157 --> 20:27.560
And I'm about to be
off the market.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.796
Don't remind me.

20:29.829 --> 20:31.631
You're kind of a
hard act to follow.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.434
(chuckles)
Bye, baby.

20:34.467 --> 20:37.069
(phone buzzes)

20:38.004 --> 20:40.139
Shine.

20:40.172 --> 20:41.808
Hey, I'm a little
busy right now, man.

20:41.841 --> 20:43.376
SHINE (on speaker):
You ain't too busy for this.

20:43.410 --> 20:44.744
Go ahead.

20:44.777 --> 20:47.079
I found out what happened
to Rafael.

20:47.113 --> 20:48.948
I'm listening.

20:48.981 --> 20:51.117
It's probably something
we shouldn't

20:51.150 --> 20:52.485
talk about on the phone.

20:52.519 --> 20:54.421
Why don't you meet me
at your office?

20:54.454 --> 20:56.456
Done.

20:59.125 --> 21:02.261
All right, I'll let you in,

21:02.295 --> 21:06.799
but after that,
whatever happens, happens.

21:06.833 --> 21:08.468
Come on, Thirsty will
finish monitoring

21:08.501 --> 21:09.736
that stuff right there.

21:09.769 --> 21:10.937
What about Shine?

21:10.970 --> 21:11.938
You just gonna
roll over there?

21:11.971 --> 21:13.506
No, Shine is in check.

21:13.540 --> 21:14.641
He's no threat at all.

21:14.674 --> 21:15.742
Well, if you need me
to roll,

21:15.775 --> 21:17.477
just give me the pistol.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.848
You got a man that's
about to propose to you.

21:23.683 --> 21:25.952
Go on.

21:33.693 --> 21:35.795
(easy jazz music playing)
ANGELO: All right,
come on over here.

21:35.828 --> 21:37.797
Girl, take this.

21:37.830 --> 21:39.766
Okay.
(clears throat)

21:39.799 --> 21:41.968
Been waiting
all evening for this.

21:42.001 --> 21:44.637
Let me get this
chair for you.

21:44.671 --> 21:46.539
There you go.

21:48.207 --> 21:50.176
All right.
(clears throat)

21:50.209 --> 21:51.444
How was your day?

21:51.478 --> 21:52.645
It was good.

21:52.679 --> 21:54.647
It was good? Excellent.
Mm-hmm.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.148
Ooh.
(clears throat)

21:56.182 --> 21:58.618
Uh, you had something
you wanted to ask me?

21:58.651 --> 22:00.953
Mm-hmm.

22:00.987 --> 22:03.656
Yes.
(clears throat)

22:07.326 --> 22:09.996
Cookie.
Mm-hmm.

22:10.029 --> 22:12.565
I have received
a very coveted spot

22:12.599 --> 22:14.467
on The Grant Kelly Show
tomorrow,

22:14.501 --> 22:17.136
and I would like you
to be by my side.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.871
Are you proposing...

22:18.905 --> 22:21.408
that I, uh,
be on TV... with you?

22:21.441 --> 22:23.543
On TV with me, yes, please.
Yeah?

22:23.576 --> 22:26.813
I mean, it's...
it's a huge show,

22:26.846 --> 22:30.650
and this would finally put all
that Coocious mess to rest.

22:30.683 --> 22:34.487
You know, show the world
that it's about you and me.

22:34.521 --> 22:38.658
Yeah. Mm-hmm. Of course.

22:38.691 --> 22:41.761
You will? Ah.
Yes, yes. (laughs)

22:41.794 --> 22:43.496
Thank you.
Mm.

22:43.530 --> 22:46.132
All right.
(laughs)

22:51.738 --> 22:53.740
(gun cocks)
Lucious.

23:06.653 --> 23:09.055
I don't want to shoot you.

23:09.088 --> 23:12.091
Well, that gun in my face
is saying something different.

23:12.124 --> 23:14.861
It's the only way I could
get your attention.

23:14.894 --> 23:17.363
You got my attention.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.065
Sit down.

23:39.185 --> 23:41.187
(Giuliana laughs)

23:43.523 --> 23:47.393
I am about to make all of
our wildest dreams come true.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.762
Look around.

23:49.796 --> 23:51.430
This place.

23:51.464 --> 23:53.065
I'm buying it.

23:53.099 --> 23:56.836
In a minute, this is gonna be
the hottest club in Vegas.

23:56.869 --> 23:58.938
Empire Vegas.

23:58.971 --> 24:01.407
(sighs)
(chuckles)

24:01.440 --> 24:06.312
Look, I didn't want to say
too much, but you got to know,

24:06.345 --> 24:10.449
I never thought I would ever
feel like this about anybody

24:10.483 --> 24:12.952
ever again.

24:15.622 --> 24:17.423
(chuckles)

24:17.456 --> 24:19.959
Give me a minute,
all right?
Sure.

24:24.564 --> 24:25.832
BUNKIE:
It's all there-- $10 million.

24:25.865 --> 24:27.667
You sure about this, Lucious?

24:27.700 --> 24:30.737
It's pretty much all we got, and
ain't none of it exactly clean.

24:37.409 --> 24:39.078
Get the cash.

24:42.481 --> 24:46.318
Uh, just give me...
just give me my girl.

24:46.352 --> 24:48.320
Your girl?

24:48.354 --> 24:50.422
That's my wife.

24:54.661 --> 24:58.197
You have any idea what
I had to do to get that money?

24:58.230 --> 25:02.535
How many bridges I burned?

25:02.569 --> 25:05.171
How many of my friends I hurt?

25:08.074 --> 25:12.511
Yes, I lied to you,
yes, I stole from you.

25:12.545 --> 25:15.648
But you have no idea
what I've been through.

25:15.682 --> 25:18.417
(crying)

25:18.450 --> 25:23.255
Rafael was an evil bastard.
Yeah,

25:23.289 --> 25:25.191
but you chose
to stay with him, huh?

25:25.224 --> 25:29.361
It took me 15 years to figure
out how to get out of that.

25:29.395 --> 25:34.166
He was coming to
take you down again.

25:34.200 --> 25:37.870
I'm sorry about all
your little boo-boos.

25:37.904 --> 25:42.341
But last time I checked,
you owe me $10 million.

25:42.374 --> 25:46.445
Uh, I don't have $10 million.

25:46.478 --> 25:48.514
Rafael took
all of it.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.149
The only way...

25:53.085 --> 25:55.487
(sighs)

25:57.556 --> 26:00.459
The only way
I can pay you back your money is

26:00.492 --> 26:02.528
if you sign off on this deal.

26:02.561 --> 26:06.365
I need you, Lucious.

26:06.398 --> 26:08.935
The gaming commissioner is
coming to Laviticus tomorrow

26:08.968 --> 26:11.370
to look over Andre's
business plan,

26:11.403 --> 26:15.074
and I need you
to sign off on it.

26:16.909 --> 26:19.445
Lucious, I killed
my husband for you.

26:28.955 --> 26:31.357
So if the commissioner
doesn't like, um...

26:33.592 --> 26:35.561
...Andre's plan,
it puts you and him

26:35.594 --> 26:37.563
in a really bad spot, right?

26:37.596 --> 26:40.700
Yes. Yes.

26:42.001 --> 26:44.403
Yeah.

26:44.436 --> 26:46.305
(sighs)

26:51.143 --> 26:53.179
(knocking)

27:06.358 --> 27:09.862
It's a new day, Anika,
and I have some exciting news.

27:09.896 --> 27:11.698
Oh. Um...

27:11.731 --> 27:14.166
(clears throat)

27:14.200 --> 27:16.769
Good morning.
(laughs)
Good morning.

27:16.803 --> 27:20.039
Wow. It's been such a
long time since I've, uh,

27:20.072 --> 27:22.174
stayed up all night talking.
TARIQ: Yeah.

27:22.208 --> 27:24.276
ANIKA:
I'm so glad we held off.

27:24.310 --> 27:27.947
You know, um, thanks
for letting me take it slow.

27:27.980 --> 27:28.981
What's the news?

27:30.016 --> 27:31.851
Spoke to Agent Sweetwater.
Oh.

27:31.884 --> 27:33.385
She got Washington
on board.

27:33.419 --> 27:34.821
Oh, okay.

27:34.854 --> 27:36.155
We're handing Lucious
and Cookie...

27:36.188 --> 27:37.824
Uh-huh.
...on a silver platter.

27:37.857 --> 27:40.126
Great, great.
Mmm. We'll both
be free of them, huh?

27:40.159 --> 27:42.661
Great, great, great.
(laughs)

27:42.695 --> 27:47.399
Wow. I, um...
You know what? I...

27:47.433 --> 27:49.736
felt really close
to you last night.

27:49.769 --> 27:52.204
Mm.

27:57.676 --> 28:00.346
Um, just-just let me go
to the bathroom. I-I...

28:00.379 --> 28:01.981
I really need to freshen up.
TARIQ: No, come on,

28:02.014 --> 28:03.750
I've been waiting
all night for this,
Oh, God.

28:03.783 --> 28:05.985
ANIKA: No, no, no, I got
morning breath, and-and...

28:06.018 --> 28:08.020
I just want to clean up.
Oh, damn,

28:08.054 --> 28:09.555
damn, damn, damn, damn, damn.
TARIQ:
Why you acting so skittish?

28:09.588 --> 28:11.057
You don't got to be nervous
with me, Anika.

28:11.090 --> 28:13.092
Sweetwater, wake your ass up.

28:13.125 --> 28:14.827
What's wrong?
Is there something wrong?

28:14.861 --> 28:16.863
(phone buzzing)
No, no, no, no, uh, no.

28:16.896 --> 28:18.397
I...

28:20.733 --> 28:22.101
What up, Agent Sweetwater?

28:24.470 --> 28:26.238
Yeah.

28:26.272 --> 28:28.775
Yeah, I know
the place.

28:28.808 --> 28:30.042
Yeah.

28:30.076 --> 28:31.510
All right.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.279
See you at noon.

28:33.312 --> 28:35.782
The ASAC is here from D.C.

28:35.815 --> 28:37.750
He wants to meet
at a hotel in Jersey.

28:37.784 --> 28:39.051
I got to get going.

28:43.622 --> 28:45.224
Anika.
Hmm?

28:45.257 --> 28:47.059
We're almost there.

28:47.093 --> 28:48.795
(chuckles)
Yes, we are.

28:56.836 --> 28:58.971
*

28:59.005 --> 29:01.340
HAKEEM: Only thing better than
breaking a new track on XStream?

29:02.942 --> 29:06.645
Screwing over Andre and
Nessa at the same damn time.

29:06.678 --> 29:08.781
DIRECTOR: And we're live.
Action, Hakeem.

29:08.815 --> 29:10.817
We got something
special for y'all.

29:10.850 --> 29:13.119
A new voice,
a new talent.

29:13.152 --> 29:15.121
Some white-hot,
blue-eyed soul

29:15.154 --> 29:18.057
about to take Empire and
the music world by storm.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.492
This is Tory Ash like you've
never heard her before.

29:20.526 --> 29:21.794
So remember where you were.

29:21.828 --> 29:22.995
Tory, what's good?

29:23.029 --> 29:25.031
*

29:35.307 --> 29:37.109
* I might play the world *

29:40.479 --> 29:42.781
* I might play the world *

29:42.815 --> 29:44.316
* And I was singing

29:44.350 --> 29:45.985
* They told me every
star's gotta fall *

29:46.018 --> 29:47.553
* But I'm loaded up
and ready to shoot *

29:48.988 --> 29:50.589
* While they sit around *

29:50.622 --> 29:51.590
* Holding up the wall *

29:51.623 --> 29:52.791
* I'll be struttin' *

29:52.825 --> 29:54.593
* In these high-heel boots *

29:54.626 --> 29:55.962
* No slowing down *

29:55.995 --> 29:57.830
* Till I make it to the top *

29:57.864 --> 29:59.665
* 'Cause this is what
I came to do *

30:01.400 --> 30:03.502
* And if you're waiting
for me to stop *

30:03.535 --> 30:05.838
* You gon' be stickin'
to the clock like glue *

30:05.872 --> 30:08.474
* 'Cause I'm the kinda girl
that wants the spotlight *

30:08.507 --> 30:09.976
* And the big dreams *
* Hey *

30:10.009 --> 30:11.710
* You do it,
I can do it better *

30:11.743 --> 30:13.846
* I can, yeah *
* And when you aim high *

30:13.880 --> 30:15.781
* And you dive deep *

30:15.814 --> 30:17.383
* There ain't nothing
that can measure *

30:17.416 --> 30:19.485
* 'Cause I'm-a keep on *

30:19.518 --> 30:20.819
* Keep on giving till I get it *

30:20.853 --> 30:22.054
* Because I just might *

30:22.088 --> 30:24.156
* Take the world *

30:24.190 --> 30:26.492
* And I'm-a play it
till I win it *

30:26.525 --> 30:28.861
* Because I just might
be the girl *

30:28.895 --> 30:30.796
* To play the world *

30:30.829 --> 30:34.800
* Whoa... *

30:34.833 --> 30:36.302
* I might play your world *

30:36.335 --> 30:40.873
* Whoa... *

30:40.907 --> 30:42.574
* I might play the world. *

30:47.914 --> 30:49.815
Okay, that's how you do.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.350
I like that.

30:51.383 --> 30:52.985
* Dressed to impress, yes... *

30:53.019 --> 30:55.354
Yo, bro, did you see Tory?
She was dope.

30:57.589 --> 31:00.359
Who's this caramel macchiato
right here?

31:00.392 --> 31:02.194
Tinashe, that's my
brother, Hakeem.

31:02.228 --> 31:04.430
TINASHE: Hi. Tinashe.
HAKEEM:
What's good?

31:04.463 --> 31:06.332
You want to come party
with us or what?

31:06.365 --> 31:08.034
TINASHE: Oh, thanks, but, um,
I'm actually in the middle

31:08.067 --> 31:09.835
of laying down some tracks.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.737
I'm helping Jamal
with his visual album.
Yeah.

31:11.770 --> 31:13.539
Well, I'm down to do a duet.

31:13.572 --> 31:15.041
I'll put Schoolboy Q on notice.
(laughing):
Okay.

31:15.074 --> 31:16.275
Good luck with that.

31:16.308 --> 31:17.609
Me and Jamal will
talk about it.

31:17.643 --> 31:19.011
I'll see you tomorrow.

31:19.045 --> 31:21.280
JAMAL:
No doubt. All right.
Bye, guys.

31:24.050 --> 31:25.918
Hakeem, what is all this, man?
What?

31:25.952 --> 31:28.220
You're not supposed to be around
this with your recovery.

31:28.254 --> 31:30.122
I wasn't partying, if that's
what you're thinking, okay?

31:30.156 --> 31:31.790
You're not supposed
to be around it.

31:32.992 --> 31:34.726
I can handle myself.

31:34.760 --> 31:36.862
Come on, man, aren't you
gonna give me props?

31:36.895 --> 31:38.430
Finally found my voice.
Uh, yeah.

31:38.464 --> 31:40.432
No doubt,
I'll give you props for that,

31:40.466 --> 31:41.700
but not for putting
yourself in danger.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.102
Oh, I see.

31:43.135 --> 31:45.304
So it's perfectly fine
for Jamal Lyon

31:45.337 --> 31:47.073
to courageously kick
his pill habit

31:47.106 --> 31:49.408
and have his major comeback,
but not for Tory Ash, right?

31:49.441 --> 31:52.078
Keep on talking
out your ass, Tory.

31:53.279 --> 31:54.713
See, you're problem is

31:54.746 --> 31:56.748
you just can't handle
any competition.
Mm.

31:56.782 --> 31:58.584
Even from your own father.

31:58.617 --> 32:01.520
* No, don't be scared
to show your skin *

32:02.989 --> 32:04.456
Want to get out of here?

32:04.490 --> 32:06.125
Yeah.
* Hold up, hold up, hold up *

32:06.158 --> 32:08.194
* Hold up, hold up. *

32:27.546 --> 32:28.814
Agent Sweetwater?

32:33.219 --> 32:34.453
You're late.

32:34.486 --> 32:37.123
(gun cocks)

32:37.156 --> 32:39.858
Traffic on that Verrazano
must've been a bitch, huh?

32:41.360 --> 32:42.661
Put that away, little brother.

32:42.694 --> 32:44.130
You know how many people
know we're here?

32:44.163 --> 32:46.432
Where's Anika?
You mean my wife?

32:46.465 --> 32:49.435
Who recorded every illegal
and pathetic move

32:49.468 --> 32:52.138
you tried to make against me?

32:52.171 --> 32:53.539
(chuckles)

32:54.806 --> 32:57.276
She was wearing a wire.

32:57.309 --> 33:00.146
But you were so horny
to get at her,

33:00.179 --> 33:03.715
you didn't even stop
and check for a moment.

33:05.351 --> 33:06.985
I took the liberty
of calling the FBI

33:07.019 --> 33:08.220
ahead of time.

33:08.254 --> 33:09.521
They're on their way.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.592
I packed you something.

33:26.372 --> 33:28.940
Something to give you
a fighting chance.

33:32.711 --> 33:35.414
I offered you an opportunity

33:35.447 --> 33:36.715
to be a part of the family,

33:36.748 --> 33:38.917
but apparently
you weren't interested, so...

33:40.586 --> 33:43.021
...now you got to run.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.672
GRANT: Mr. Dubois,
not only have you bounced back

34:00.706 --> 34:02.508
from what could have been
an enormous scandal,

34:02.541 --> 34:03.909
you're now seen
as the front-runner.

34:03.942 --> 34:05.111
That's quite a turnaround.

34:05.144 --> 34:07.012
Yes. Yes, I'm thankful.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.881
Uh, I also have to thank
my team.

34:09.915 --> 34:12.118
My team and, quite frankly,

34:12.151 --> 34:14.019
I have Cookie to thank as well.

34:14.052 --> 34:15.521
Ms. Lyon,
you are being called

34:15.554 --> 34:17.456
the breakout star
of this campaign.

34:17.489 --> 34:18.857
You drove up Angelo's
poll numbers

34:18.890 --> 34:20.459
after your first public
appearance with him.

34:20.492 --> 34:21.960
You ever thought
of running yourself?
Hell...

34:21.993 --> 34:23.729
(Angelo and Cookie chuckle)

34:23.762 --> 34:26.198
I'm sorry. Uh, no.

34:26.232 --> 34:28.066
I believe in this man, and I...

34:28.100 --> 34:31.437
I think he will make a great
mayor for New York City.

34:31.470 --> 34:33.105
Tell me, because I know
that this question

34:33.139 --> 34:35.141
is on the forefront
of everyone's minds.

34:35.174 --> 34:37.143
With the prospect of
Gracie Mansion in your future,

34:37.176 --> 34:40.812
do the two of you have any plans
to solidify your commitment?

34:42.080 --> 34:45.717
Well, we take it
one step at a time.

34:45.751 --> 34:47.319
Right, Angelo?

34:47.353 --> 34:49.888
Yes, yes. We've,
we've been discussing this.

34:49.921 --> 34:52.758
Uh, as a matter of fact...

34:52.791 --> 34:53.959
(clears throat)

34:53.992 --> 34:56.061
Uh...

34:56.094 --> 35:00.799
I know that you like
grand gestures, so...

35:02.334 --> 35:04.803
(sighs deeply)

35:04.836 --> 35:06.305
(spectators gasp)

35:06.338 --> 35:09.408
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you, Cookie.

35:09.441 --> 35:11.910
WOMAN:
It's gorgeous.

35:11.943 --> 35:14.713
Will you marry me?

35:16.882 --> 35:19.117
(murmuring)

35:21.019 --> 35:22.421
(Cookie exhales)

35:22.454 --> 35:25.123
Oh, my God.

35:25.157 --> 35:26.458
(laughs)

35:27.959 --> 35:29.761
(chuckles)

35:29.795 --> 35:31.197
Oh, boy.

35:31.230 --> 35:33.865
(applause)

35:33.899 --> 35:35.301
(laughing):
There you have it, folks.

35:35.334 --> 35:37.269
Angelo Dubois just got engaged
to Cookie Lyon

35:37.303 --> 35:38.670
right here
on The Grant Kelly Show.

35:38.704 --> 35:40.506
Congratulations,
Mr. Soon to be Mayor.

35:40.539 --> 35:42.508
ANGELO: Thank you,
sir, I appreciate it.

35:42.541 --> 35:44.976
GRANT:
My pleasure.

35:45.010 --> 35:48.380
*

35:48.414 --> 35:51.517
You do understand that
Nessa can't screw this up.

35:51.550 --> 35:53.051
She's not gonna screw this up.

35:53.084 --> 35:55.120
Nessa's gonna be
one of Empire's biggest stars.

35:55.153 --> 35:57.122
I'm telling you.

35:57.155 --> 36:00.392
I don't think you understand.

36:00.426 --> 36:03.329
I have made some big
promises on this deal.

36:03.362 --> 36:05.397
So have I, Giuliana.

36:05.431 --> 36:08.434
(slot machines chiming)

36:10.902 --> 36:12.204
What the hell?

36:12.238 --> 36:14.139
Did you know about this?
No.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.208
Who is that?
Charlotte Frost,

36:16.242 --> 36:17.976
the most powerful person
in Vegas.
They have
live shows,

36:18.009 --> 36:20.546
but our show itself
is the show.

36:20.579 --> 36:23.148
We're going
to be filled

36:23.181 --> 36:25.484
with all of hip-hop's
latest artists,

36:25.517 --> 36:27.486
telling their own
personal stories

36:27.519 --> 36:30.556
about the history of
hip-hop from right here.

36:30.589 --> 36:32.224
I mean, Birdman
and Snoop

36:32.258 --> 36:34.526
is already filed
in as investors.

36:34.560 --> 36:37.229
So we've got a ton of
other people on there.

36:37.263 --> 36:38.597
Giuliana.

36:38.630 --> 36:39.865
Lucious.

36:39.898 --> 36:41.433
Well, this is Charlotte Frost,

36:41.467 --> 36:44.035
as you know, the head
of the gaming commission.

36:44.069 --> 36:45.337
Say hello.

36:45.371 --> 36:46.872
How are you, Giuliana?

36:46.905 --> 36:48.374
GIULIANA:
I'm wonderful. And you?

36:48.407 --> 36:49.541
I'm good.
Andre.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.112
You and Nessa are out.

36:54.145 --> 36:56.248
Wanted to share that with you.

36:56.282 --> 36:57.916
CHARLOTTE:
I'm impressed.

36:57.949 --> 37:00.185
Did not expect this.

37:00.218 --> 37:03.589
Lucious, when Giuliana told me
I had to come to New York,

37:03.622 --> 37:06.425
I was prepared to be irked
if it wasn't worth my while.

37:06.458 --> 37:12.264
But this... this crosses
the threshold into interesting.

37:12.298 --> 37:15.467
"Interesting." She said you
would call it interesting.

37:15.501 --> 37:17.603
Initially, I was going
to bore you

37:17.636 --> 37:20.105
with a bunch of
charts and graphs,

37:20.138 --> 37:24.209
but Giuliana said that we should
put on a live-action show.

37:24.242 --> 37:25.611
So you can get

37:25.644 --> 37:27.779
a tangible experience from it.
Yes.

37:27.813 --> 37:29.848
Uh, Thirsty?

37:31.016 --> 37:32.083
What's up?

37:32.117 --> 37:33.585
Would you mind taking
care of our guest?

37:33.619 --> 37:34.586
Absolutely.

37:34.620 --> 37:35.754
Great job.

37:35.787 --> 37:37.789
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

37:37.823 --> 37:39.458
Do a little gambling,
maybe?

37:40.859 --> 37:44.262
Well, aren't you just
full of surprises?

37:46.031 --> 37:47.733
(exhales)

37:47.766 --> 37:50.636
What were you thinking, putting
me on the spot like that?

37:50.669 --> 37:52.838
Wait a minute, J-J-J...

37:52.871 --> 37:55.240
Jamal said that you liked
showmanship.

37:55.273 --> 37:57.309
I like a man who can think
for himself, Angelo.

37:57.343 --> 37:58.510
Well...

37:58.544 --> 38:00.245
Look, I need a minute, okay?

38:00.278 --> 38:02.247
I just, I need time
to think about this.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.015
This is just happening too fast.

38:04.049 --> 38:06.618
Think about it? What's there
to think about, baby?

38:06.652 --> 38:09.154
What, are you scared?
'Cause, uh...

38:09.187 --> 38:11.289
we can talk about it.
Do you want to talk about it?

38:13.692 --> 38:15.694
(sighs)
Oh, Angelo.

38:18.364 --> 38:20.532
I've been trying
to right my past.

38:20.566 --> 38:23.602
Right your past?
Yes, the mistakes
I made in my past.

38:23.635 --> 38:26.338
With my father.

38:26.372 --> 38:29.541
Trying to please him.

38:29.575 --> 38:31.843
By being with a man like you,

38:31.877 --> 38:37.816
because the relationship with
Lucious, that's what killed him.

38:37.849 --> 38:40.051
Lucious.

38:40.085 --> 38:42.454
I should've known
this was about his ass.

38:42.488 --> 38:43.955
You're still in love with him.

38:43.989 --> 38:46.157
It's not about
Lucious at all.

38:46.191 --> 38:47.526
(crackles)

38:47.559 --> 38:49.995
COOKIE (over mic):
It's about me.

38:51.597 --> 38:56.602
And I'd be lying to you
if I didn't say that...

38:58.336 --> 39:02.307
...I still have feelings
for him.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.875
You still have feelings
for Lucious.

39:03.909 --> 39:05.210
COOKIE:
I wanted to be honest with you.

39:05.243 --> 39:06.712
I don't want to hide that.

39:07.746 --> 39:09.748
We kissed.

39:09.781 --> 39:11.550
It was just a kiss.

39:11.583 --> 39:12.818
One time.

39:12.851 --> 39:14.486
And I have been trying

39:14.520 --> 39:15.921
to tell you.

39:15.954 --> 39:17.856
No. Okay, wait,
now-- shh!

39:17.889 --> 39:20.526
(grunts)

39:20.559 --> 39:22.728
I compromised
my integrity.

39:22.761 --> 39:26.865
I compromised
the integrity of my campaign

39:26.898 --> 39:29.901
over and over for you!

39:29.935 --> 39:32.203
I got that Freda
what's-her-face

39:32.237 --> 39:33.371
out of jail for Jamal!

39:33.405 --> 39:34.440
Fraudulently, Cookie!

39:34.473 --> 39:35.607
Shh.

39:35.641 --> 39:37.543
I broke the law
for your ass!

39:37.576 --> 39:39.244
The, the illegal handgun!

39:39.277 --> 39:40.846
Th-The parole violation!

39:40.879 --> 39:43.081
I did all of that
for you, Cookie!

39:44.583 --> 39:45.717
And now you're
gonna tell me

39:45.751 --> 39:46.885
Angelo.
that you still
have feelings

39:46.918 --> 39:48.219
for that greasy...

39:48.253 --> 39:50.055
Hot mic, baby, hot mic.

39:53.659 --> 39:55.661
(phone buzzing)

40:01.066 --> 40:02.367
My mama was right.

40:02.400 --> 40:05.303
Your whole family is poison.

40:05.336 --> 40:06.638
All of y'all
are garbage.

40:06.672 --> 40:08.774
Every last one
of y'all.

40:11.342 --> 40:13.011
(phone buzzing)

40:18.416 --> 40:19.818
Um, this is, this is my son.

40:19.851 --> 40:21.052
I need to take this.

40:21.086 --> 40:22.087
Take it outside.

40:22.120 --> 40:24.122
(phone continues buzzing)

40:27.358 --> 40:30.128
Angelo.

40:30.161 --> 40:32.230
Angelo, it's okay.
She said...

40:32.263 --> 40:33.732
No.
It's gonna be all right.

40:33.765 --> 40:35.133
Mama, how is everything
gonna be all right?

40:35.166 --> 40:37.135
You have done nothing wrong.

40:37.168 --> 40:39.304
That ungrateful bitch
blindsided you.

40:39.337 --> 40:41.272
She's wrecked everything,
but listen to me.

40:41.306 --> 40:43.509
Listen to me.
Okay, okay.

40:43.542 --> 40:46.344
I'm taking charge now.

40:46.377 --> 40:51.583
And I will not rest until I see
the Lyons groveling in the dirt,

40:51.617 --> 40:55.621
begging for a merciful death.

40:55.654 --> 40:58.423
They messed with the wrong clan.

40:58.456 --> 41:01.459
They're going down.

41:06.832 --> 41:09.300
*

41:09.334 --> 41:11.202
(crowd cheering)

41:13.038 --> 41:15.674
Ladies and gentlemen,

41:15.707 --> 41:17.809
please direct your attention
to center stage,

41:17.843 --> 41:20.979
where you will see
the eighth wonder of the world,

41:21.012 --> 41:23.148
the legendary Tory Ash!

41:23.181 --> 41:25.183
(crowd cheering)

41:29.821 --> 41:34.492
* Crazy love,
I can't go without you *

41:34.526 --> 41:38.296
* Got us doing things
we ain't supposed to do *

41:38.329 --> 41:42.500
* Boy, you crept in my heart,
turned my whole world apart *

41:42.534 --> 41:46.004
* And now you're all I need *
* You're all I need *

41:46.037 --> 41:48.039
* Hey-hey, hey-hey *

41:48.073 --> 41:53.178
* Mountains high
and the valley low *

41:53.211 --> 41:56.982
* He can make a woman
lose all control *

41:57.015 --> 42:01.352
* And God only knows
what this trouble road *

42:01.386 --> 42:03.221
* Lies in front of me *

42:03.254 --> 42:05.657
* In front of me, hey-hey *

42:05.691 --> 42:10.161
* But, my darling,
there's no limit to my loving *

42:10.195 --> 42:15.266
* You got everything I need
and that I'm wanting *

42:15.300 --> 42:19.437
* I'm not used to giving
my heart and soul *

42:19.470 --> 42:22.540
* Just to be hanging around
for love *

42:22.574 --> 42:26.244
* Aw, aw, baby,
I'm such a fool... *

42:26.277 --> 42:27.679
First she steals my song,

42:27.713 --> 42:29.214
now she's standing
in my spot, Shine.

42:29.247 --> 42:30.415
Now, tell me

42:30.448 --> 42:31.950
you did not
know about this.

42:31.983 --> 42:35.120
No. Neither did
your punk-ass boyfriend.

42:35.153 --> 42:37.723
Get your men together.

42:37.756 --> 42:39.457
We're gonna take him out.

42:39.490 --> 42:42.628
* 'Cause of you, boy,
what the hell did I do? *

42:42.661 --> 42:45.230
* I'm crazy, crazy for you *

42:45.263 --> 42:47.599
* Angel smile *
* Do, do *

42:47.633 --> 42:50.235
* With those devilish eyes *
* Do, do *

42:50.268 --> 42:54.740
* Boy, you took me,
you took me by surprise *
* Do, do, do, do... *

42:54.773 --> 42:56.608
It's a beautiful song.

42:56.642 --> 42:57.843
It's haunting.

42:59.177 --> 43:00.578
Yeah, I wrote it for her.

43:02.748 --> 43:04.950
I meant every word of it.

43:04.983 --> 43:07.653
* Oh, but, my darling,
there's no limit to my loving *

43:07.686 --> 43:12.223
* You got everything I need
and that I'm wanting *

43:12.257 --> 43:16.628
* I'm not used to giving
my heart and soul *

43:16.662 --> 43:18.596
* I do them all 'cause of you *

43:18.630 --> 43:21.599
* Boy, what the hell did I do? *

43:21.633 --> 43:23.635
* I'm crazy, crazy for you. *

43:59.971 --> 44:01.006
Yeah.

44:15.653 --> 44:17.288
Something
ain't right here.

44:17.322 --> 44:19.524
The department

44:26.497 --> 44:28.499
