01:19.000 --> 01:21.321
- Now it
had become the still center

01:21.440 --> 01:25.729
of that spinning wheel
of misfortune.

01:25.840 --> 01:27.524
The world turned
round him,

01:27.640 --> 01:32.043
leaving him
miraculously untouched.

01:32.160 --> 01:35.482
The croupier had
reached his goal.

01:35.600 --> 01:38.968
He no longer heard
the sound of the ball.

01:43.160 --> 01:45.766
To begin with,
he was Jack Manfred.

01:47.320 --> 01:49.641
- Now, then.
- I want a job, Giles.

01:49.760 --> 01:52.047
- I see. Well...

01:52.160 --> 01:55.403
Let me tell you a little bit
about our operation.

01:55.520 --> 01:57.409
We like
personality authors.

01:57.520 --> 01:59.443
People the public
recognizes.

01:59.560 --> 02:01.767
Celebrity's what
sells books.

02:01.880 --> 02:03.928
You can always find somebody
to do the writing.

02:04.040 --> 02:07.567
What we need is the face...
then the concept.

02:07.680 --> 02:11.048
Right now I'm looking
for a soccer novel.

02:11.160 --> 02:14.881
Something where a tycoon
buys a lousy team

02:15.000 --> 02:16.445
and takes it to the top.

02:16.560 --> 02:17.846
Seven-figure
transfer fees.

02:17.960 --> 02:20.440
Corruption all
down the line.

02:20.560 --> 02:23.086
Violence on
and off the pitch.

02:23.200 --> 02:25.441
Steroids.

02:27.520 --> 02:30.171
You got any concepts?

02:30.280 --> 02:34.080
It could be a thug story.

02:34.200 --> 02:37.647
I'll tell you what,
why don't you think about it?

02:37.800 --> 02:40.167
Hmm? Couple of pages.

02:42.280 --> 02:44.408
With plenty of sex,
of course.

02:44.560 --> 02:46.562
Fiona!

02:47.880 --> 02:49.962
- Interesting, Giles.

02:50.080 --> 02:53.448
I will think about it.

02:53.560 --> 02:56.086
- Let me give you three
words of advice, Jack.

02:56.200 --> 02:58.043
Don't give up.

02:58.160 --> 02:59.844
Stick with it.

02:59.960 --> 03:02.964
Who persists, wins,
that's my motto.

03:03.120 --> 03:05.600
Write, write, write.

03:05.720 --> 03:08.485
- And Jack had
three words for Giles.

03:08.600 --> 03:10.807
Go fuck yourself.

03:33.680 --> 03:36.160
Jack knew something
was wrong.

03:36.320 --> 03:39.961
He'd forgotten Giles' advice.
Giles said three words.

03:49.440 --> 03:52.125
Nobody around, leave a
message after the beep.

03:56.440 --> 03:57.965
- Jacko.

03:58.080 --> 04:00.128
If you're there,
pick up, would ya.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.369
I want to talk to
you, it's important.

04:03.480 --> 04:06.051
Jacko, I've got
some news for you.

04:06.160 --> 04:08.686
Come on, Jacko.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.370
- Yeah, Dad, it's me.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.807
- How's it going?
- Good, yeah.

04:12.920 --> 04:16.129
- Found a job yet?
- No.

04:16.240 --> 04:19.369
- Well I've got something
for you, in London I mean.

04:19.480 --> 04:21.447
I've been chatting with
some friends. Now...

04:21.560 --> 04:24.291
Do you know
the Golden Lion Casino?

04:24.400 --> 04:25.970
They're looking
for a dealer.

04:26.120 --> 04:29.363
- Yeah, that's not
what I wanna do, Dad.

04:29.480 --> 04:31.403
- Now, I know you don't
like taking my advice...

04:31.520 --> 04:33.090
- No, it's not that.

04:33.200 --> 04:36.170
- Listen, I've set
this up for you.

04:36.280 --> 04:38.851
Now you call the Golden Lion,
and you ask to speak

04:38.960 --> 04:41.691
to Mr. Reynolds.
That's the manager.

04:41.840 --> 04:44.923
Now I don't know him personally,
but I have spoken to his boss.

04:45.040 --> 04:47.281
Now, don't say no, Jacko.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.971
Give yourself a break.

04:50.080 --> 04:52.651
- All right, Dad. Yeah,
I'll think about it.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.161
- Reynolds at
the Golden Lion.

04:55.280 --> 04:57.965
- Yeah. All right, Dad.
- Yes. I'll call him.

04:58.080 --> 05:00.924
- You do that.
- That's my boy.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.524
- So how are
you doing, Dad?

05:04.640 --> 05:06.005
- Great.

05:06.160 --> 05:08.367
Yeah, just started
a new company.

05:08.480 --> 05:10.130
Solid financing.

05:10.240 --> 05:12.891
It's good.

05:13.040 --> 05:16.806
Jacko, you know I
love you, don't you?

05:16.960 --> 05:19.281
- Yeah. I know that.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.129
- Don't let
yourself down.

05:21.240 --> 05:22.844
- I won't.

05:22.960 --> 05:25.566
- I'll keep in touch.

05:28.080 --> 05:30.162
- Goodbye, Dad.

05:34.520 --> 05:37.251
- It was unbelievable.
- I was in the room.

05:37.360 --> 05:39.761
500.

05:39.880 --> 05:42.929
Uh-huh. Blackjack.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.725
See you then, bye.

05:45.840 --> 05:48.525
- Sorry to have kept you.
- What'll you have?

06:00.560 --> 06:04.201
- Nope. Jack knew
it still wasn't quite right.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.806
- I wanna fuck
the whole world over!

06:15.920 --> 06:17.843
Ha!

06:21.960 --> 06:25.362
- He had
just one word for Giles.

06:40.040 --> 06:43.362
- David Reynolds.
- I'm the manager.

06:43.480 --> 06:45.801
- Sit down, John.
- Jack.

06:47.320 --> 06:49.891
- You've been recommended
by the management here.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.207
They know your father.

06:52.320 --> 06:54.482
He's a bit of
a reputation, hasn't he?

06:54.640 --> 06:56.529
- Has he?

06:56.640 --> 06:57.766
- In any case, I understand
you've had some

06:57.880 --> 07:01.043
previous experience
in South Africa.

07:01.160 --> 07:04.687
You'll find the rules here
just a little bit different.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.450
Before we start, you haven't
got a police record, have you?

07:06.560 --> 07:08.528
- No.

07:08.640 --> 07:11.007
- What school did you go to?
- I was at Bedales.

07:11.120 --> 07:14.329
- Oh. I don't think
I know that one.

07:14.440 --> 07:16.761
Private, I suppose.

07:16.880 --> 07:19.360
There's three types
of casino in the UK.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.528
High volume, small action,
and middle of the road.

07:21.640 --> 07:23.642
That's us.
Okay, Charlie.

07:23.760 --> 07:25.046
- Do you have
a salon prive?

07:25.160 --> 07:27.845
- We tried.
- Wasn't enough business.

07:27.960 --> 07:31.009
- Punters like company.
- Welcome back, Jack...

07:32.280 --> 07:35.682
...to the house
of addiction.

07:35.800 --> 07:37.643
- Thanks, Charlie.

07:42.320 --> 07:44.607
Right. Let's see you
handle the chips.

07:44.720 --> 07:46.006
- I have to assume
the serial numbers

07:46.120 --> 07:48.282
on the bowl
and wheel correspond.

07:48.400 --> 07:52.041
- We check every two days.
- Why not every day?

07:52.200 --> 07:54.089
- Procedure here.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.482
Right, sort the chips.

08:01.480 --> 08:03.369
Go.

08:19.160 --> 08:21.049
Good.

08:23.680 --> 08:26.843
All right, now pay
me out $1,800 in 25s.

08:36.280 --> 08:39.284
Very good. Okay, let's have
a look at your blackjack.

08:52.040 --> 08:53.530
- Fourteen.

08:53.640 --> 08:57.247
Too many.

08:57.360 --> 08:58.964
Nineteen, Sixteen.

08:59.080 --> 09:02.084
Too many.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.804
Thirteen.

09:03.920 --> 09:05.684
Eighteen, Fourteen.

09:05.800 --> 09:06.801
Nineteen.

09:06.920 --> 09:08.809
Twenty.

09:12.120 --> 09:15.044
- What's the count?
- Minus nine.

09:15.200 --> 09:18.249
- I make it minus eight.
- Minus nine.

09:18.360 --> 09:21.443
- What makes you so sure?
- It's the rule.

09:21.560 --> 09:22.686
Always stand by
your first count.

09:22.800 --> 09:25.565
The odds are
you're right.

09:25.680 --> 09:27.808
- Good call.
- You want me to check?

09:27.960 --> 09:31.362
- I said,
good call.

09:31.480 --> 09:34.165
- lthadtaken
him 45 minutes,

09:34.280 --> 09:36.760
but Jack now had
Mr. Reynolds' number.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.405
The man
couldn't count.

09:38.520 --> 09:41.808
- Right, just let me
run through a few things.

09:41.920 --> 09:44.002
As a dealer,
you never gamble.

09:44.120 --> 09:47.124
Not anywhere. And we'll
need your picture.

09:47.240 --> 09:50.005
- What for?
- For the database.

09:50.120 --> 09:52.646
It can be accessed by
every casino in the country.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.046
We have the same
system for punters.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.049
- I don't gamble.
- Ever?

09:56.160 --> 09:59.448
- I don't gamble,
Mr. Reynolds.

09:59.560 --> 10:01.324
- Huh.

10:01.440 --> 10:03.522
- Next point.

10:03.640 --> 10:05.130
Friendships between
croupiers inside

10:05.240 --> 10:08.767
or outside the casino
are discouraged.

10:08.920 --> 10:11.651
Relationships with
females working here...

10:11.760 --> 10:13.808
- are expressly forbidden.
- We had the same rule

10:13.920 --> 10:16.400
in Sun City, but it was
impossible to check.

10:16.520 --> 10:18.682
- Well this isn't
South Africa.

10:18.800 --> 10:21.963
We'd know, because
someone would report it.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.570
Believe me, someone
always does.

10:23.680 --> 10:26.251
- Does know, or does report?
- What would happen

10:26.360 --> 10:28.522
if I knew something like that
and didn't report it?

10:28.640 --> 10:30.529
- We'd know.

10:30.640 --> 10:33.086
There are no secrets
in this casino.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.488
- And you'd be punished.
- How?

10:36.600 --> 10:39.729
- First offense, verbal warning.
- Second offense, written warning.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.923
That one's filed and sometimes
copied to the gaming board.

10:43.040 --> 10:45.566
My discretion.

10:45.680 --> 10:48.604
Third offense, you'd
be sacked on the spot.

10:48.720 --> 10:52.441
You'd never work in a casino
in this country again.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.562
And there's
another rule.

10:54.680 --> 10:57.923
You're forbidden to talk to
or recognize a punter

10:58.040 --> 11:01.089
outside the casino. If you see
someone who's gambled here,

11:01.200 --> 11:03.521
even if it's just
casually on the street,

11:03.680 --> 11:06.251
you must ignore
him or her.

11:07.560 --> 11:09.483
Not married, are you?

11:09.600 --> 11:11.568
Girlfriend?

11:11.680 --> 11:14.445
- Yeah.
- She's not in the...

11:14.560 --> 11:16.608
she's not in the gaming
business, is she?

11:16.720 --> 11:18.324
- No.

11:18.440 --> 11:21.205
- Good.

11:23.920 --> 11:27.083
This is our
Crow's nest.

11:27.200 --> 11:28.929
I'm showing you it now, but
you'll never see it again.

11:29.080 --> 11:31.048
- Very impressive.

11:32.920 --> 11:35.207
- We have tapes here
that go back six months.

11:35.320 --> 11:38.005
Here, let me show
you something.

11:46.480 --> 11:48.608
See that?

11:48.720 --> 11:50.882
Six weeks ago.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.083
Dealer missed it.
Guy up here missed it.

11:54.200 --> 11:56.362
I watch these
tapes after hours.

11:56.480 --> 11:58.767
Nothing gets by me.

11:58.880 --> 12:01.531
Lady's in jail now.

12:01.640 --> 12:04.484
It's easier to take ten
million pounds from a bank,

12:04.600 --> 12:07.410
than to take one
penny from this casino.

12:09.320 --> 12:12.847
Right. Well, as soon as you get
your license, you can start.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.286
- Fine.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.890
- So...

12:16.000 --> 12:19.129
Are you planning to make
a career in casino work?

12:19.240 --> 12:20.480
And end up like you?

12:20.600 --> 12:22.329
L-- I just
want a job.

12:22.440 --> 12:24.488
- You're not the usual
type we get in here, Jack.

12:24.600 --> 12:26.887
Mr. Reynolds
was right, it was true.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.764
Excuse me.

12:28.880 --> 12:30.723
- Jack was
up above the world.

12:30.840 --> 12:33.684
A writer looking
down on his subject.

12:33.800 --> 12:35.484
A detached...

12:35.600 --> 12:37.443
- I can't talk
about that just now.

12:37.560 --> 12:40.291
- Voyeur.
- I'm with somebody.

12:40.400 --> 12:43.609
Well, they can wait.

12:43.720 --> 12:46.291
I'll be home at
the usual time.

12:48.960 --> 12:51.042
Don't get married, Jack.

12:51.160 --> 12:54.642
Casino work doesn't mix
with house and garden.

12:54.760 --> 12:56.125
Any questions?

12:56.240 --> 12:58.891
- Yeah. What's the salary?

13:01.680 --> 13:04.889
- The casino paid
its staff monthly in arrears.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.482
He would have to wait six
weeks for his first check.

13:08.640 --> 13:10.961
- He needed money now.
- So, what kind of deal

13:11.080 --> 13:13.128
are you looking for?

13:13.240 --> 13:14.810
- What's the book price?

13:14.920 --> 13:16.649
- That's not relevant.

13:16.760 --> 13:20.446
Old car like this,
depends on the condition.

13:21.840 --> 13:23.968
- The car was
a gift from Jack's father.

13:24.080 --> 13:25.844
That's to say,
Jack Sr. Had given it to him

13:25.960 --> 13:29.043
before the
bailiffs arrived.

13:29.200 --> 13:32.921
- And this ain't exactly
what you call "mint."

13:33.080 --> 13:35.162
- How about $1,500?

13:35.280 --> 13:37.806
- How about $500?
- What?

13:37.960 --> 13:40.691
- How about we split
the difference?

13:40.840 --> 13:42.524
$750.

13:42.640 --> 13:44.927
- Is that your idea
of arithmetic?

13:45.040 --> 13:47.771
- I'm not a mathematician.
- I'm in business.

13:47.880 --> 13:50.486
- $850.
- $750.

13:54.160 --> 13:55.730
- He suddenly
wanted to be rid of it.

13:55.840 --> 13:59.083
Hang on tightly,
let go lightly.

14:06.880 --> 14:09.645
Jack imagined people
reading his book.

14:09.760 --> 14:12.001
One day he would get
into their heads.

14:12.160 --> 14:14.083
Play with their
imaginations.

14:14.200 --> 14:16.771
Test their feelings.

14:18.960 --> 14:22.203
He would tell them, you have
to make the choice in life.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.800
Be a gambler,
or a croupier.

14:26.880 --> 14:29.486
And then live with your
decision, come what may.

14:31.960 --> 14:34.691
Marion saw life
differently.

14:35.760 --> 14:38.764
She was a romantic...

14:38.880 --> 14:40.723
and thought
he was, too.

14:55.680 --> 14:57.887
- I couldn't resist them.

14:58.040 --> 15:00.407
- You mean I
won't resist them.

15:00.520 --> 15:02.170
- No.

15:02.280 --> 15:06.205
I'm not ready for you.

15:06.320 --> 15:08.482
There's some vodka
in the freezer.

15:08.600 --> 15:11.331
- You want me drunk?
- I won't take that long!

15:35.920 --> 15:37.763
Jack.

15:46.480 --> 15:48.323
- Wow.

15:51.760 --> 15:53.683
You really are
a beautiful woman.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.370
- It's not just
inner beauty, is it?

15:55.480 --> 15:57.482
- Turn around.

16:02.040 --> 16:04.042
You're all I desire.

16:15.760 --> 16:19.128
- Where did you get it?
- I sold the car.

16:19.240 --> 16:21.447
- You shouldn't have done that,
I know what it meant to you.

16:21.560 --> 16:23.528
- I owe you for the rent.

16:23.640 --> 16:26.120
It's only a car,
I can get another.

16:26.240 --> 16:27.730
- Take it back.
- No.

16:27.880 --> 16:31.089
- Till you sell your book.
- Marion, let's face the truth.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.089
Nobody is gonna publish it.

16:33.200 --> 16:37.205
- Of course, they are.
- You just have to be patient.

16:41.360 --> 16:43.089
- I'm betting on you.
- I'm not much of a bet.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.521
- You are to me.

16:48.920 --> 16:51.127
Come into
my world.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.241
You're my prisoner.

17:02.360 --> 17:04.203
- I've got something
to tell you.

17:04.319 --> 17:06.925
- I wanna hear it.
- I've got a job.

17:10.400 --> 17:13.165
- What job'?
- In a casino.

17:13.280 --> 17:16.887
As a croupier. Dealer.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.765
- How did you land that?
- It came my way.

17:19.880 --> 17:22.451
450 a week.

17:22.599 --> 17:25.046
<i>' 450'?</i>

17:25.160 --> 17:26.605
What did you do?
Just walk in and say,

17:26.720 --> 17:29.610
- I want to be a croupier?
- Don't you need training?

17:29.720 --> 17:32.883
- I had training.
- In the republic.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.526
- You were
a croupier there?

17:35.640 --> 17:37.722
You never
told me that.

17:37.840 --> 17:39.968
I thought you just
knew some gamblers.

17:40.120 --> 17:42.168
- I start Monday week.

17:42.280 --> 17:44.248
- 450 a week?

17:44.360 --> 17:46.840
I've never earned
that in my life.

17:49.040 --> 17:50.769
You're an enigma, you are.

17:50.920 --> 17:52.843
A fucking enigma.

17:52.960 --> 17:56.043
- I'm not an enigma.
- Just a contradiction.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.481
- You sold the car.

17:58.640 --> 18:01.610
You've got a job.

18:01.720 --> 18:04.007
What's the third thing?

18:06.880 --> 18:09.121
Tell me.

18:10.960 --> 18:14.043
- There's no third thing.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.527
Don't be superstitious.

18:18.800 --> 18:20.723
- I love you, Jack.
- You know that.

18:20.840 --> 18:24.481
- And he half-loved
Marion, and she knew that, too.

18:25.560 --> 18:27.642
You trying to
read my palm?

18:29.400 --> 18:32.563
- You've got such
beautiful hands.

18:32.680 --> 18:36.082
The hands of a
Conjurer, a woman told him once.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.282
Or a cardsharp.

18:41.560 --> 18:45.565
- Do you work around here?
- My office is in Shanghai.

18:45.680 --> 18:48.251
- What do you do?
- I'm an arms dealer.

18:49.760 --> 18:52.969
- So, what line
of work are you in, then?

18:54.600 --> 18:58.321
- I'm an undertaker.

18:58.440 --> 19:00.727
- Really?

19:08.600 --> 19:10.807
- Now place your bets, please.

19:18.960 --> 19:21.691
- Jack Manfred.
- Jack Manfred. Table three.

19:25.680 --> 19:28.570
- And you have a new
dealer. Thank you.

19:28.680 --> 19:30.523
Usual bunch.

19:30.640 --> 19:32.244
They didn't know Jack,
but he knew them.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.607
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

19:37.200 --> 19:39.680
- Where's the other
fellow? Where's Jeff?

19:39.800 --> 19:40.722
- Where's Jeff'?
- Jeff.

19:40.840 --> 19:43.366
He's been
re-assigned, sir.

19:43.480 --> 19:45.369
- Well let's hope you know
how to do your job.

19:45.480 --> 19:49.166
- In fives.
- Change.

19:49.280 --> 19:52.124
- What aftershave are you using?
- Never converse

19:52.240 --> 19:54.811
with the punters.
Slows things down.

19:54.960 --> 19:57.361
Money down.

19:57.480 --> 19:59.881
Speed is volume.
Volume is profit for the casino.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.288
Aim at 4O spins an hour.
Place your bets, please.

20:13.440 --> 20:15.522
No more bets,
thank you.

20:18.200 --> 20:19.690
10 black.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.451
Ooh, the scam.

20:43.560 --> 20:45.961
Come in with three grand
cash, no questions asked.

20:46.080 --> 20:49.163
Launder it by getting a
casino check when you cash in.

20:49.280 --> 20:51.567
Jack wondered why
Mr. Reynolds permitted it.

20:51.680 --> 20:54.126
After all, there was no
profit in it for the casino.

20:54.240 --> 20:57.608
Place your
bets, please.

20:57.720 --> 20:59.961
Or was there?

21:02.440 --> 21:03.566
13.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.648
Too many.

21:05.760 --> 21:07.603
16.

21:07.720 --> 21:09.484
Too many.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.090
15.

21:11.200 --> 21:13.282
Too many.

21:13.400 --> 21:14.970
12.

21:15.080 --> 21:17.003
Too many.

21:17.120 --> 21:18.963
11, Double.

21:22.160 --> 21:24.891
21.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.162
Black jack.

21:30.640 --> 21:33.211
A wave of
elation came over him.

21:33.320 --> 21:36.290
He was hooked again.
Place your bets, please.

21:36.440 --> 21:38.807
Watching people lose.

21:46.480 --> 21:48.562
New dealer.

21:50.440 --> 21:53.125
- Evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening.

21:54.360 --> 21:57.091
- Jack.

21:57.200 --> 22:00.090
Good work.
Keep it up.

22:01.880 --> 22:03.928
- Color change.

22:07.120 --> 22:08.849
100.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.928
Place your
bets, please.

22:16.240 --> 22:18.846
Don't give me that sob story.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.491
- That's a lie, Ben.

22:26.080 --> 22:29.721
- You've been secretly
seeing Charlie for years.

22:29.840 --> 22:32.446
- Stop it!
- No I won't.

22:36.600 --> 22:40.286
- I'm Bella.
- Jack Manfred.

22:40.400 --> 22:43.370
- Hi, Jack.

22:43.480 --> 22:45.960
Welcome to
the cesspit.

22:46.080 --> 22:47.570
- Is it that bad?

23:02.200 --> 23:03.725
- How do I look?

23:03.840 --> 23:05.365
Like trouble, Bella.

23:05.480 --> 23:07.926
You look fine.

23:08.040 --> 23:11.408
- Tits in a uniform.
- Punters love it.

23:22.480 --> 23:24.562
- Your usual, sir.

23:24.680 --> 23:25.727
Thank you, sir.
Enjoy your game.

23:25.880 --> 23:27.928
5O quid for a Diet Coke.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.725
Waitresses were the true
winners in a casino.

23:30.840 --> 23:33.411
The only members of staff
allowed to accept tips.

23:33.520 --> 23:35.090
- Thank you, Jack.

23:35.200 --> 23:37.168
Enjoy yourself,
Mr. Tchai.

23:37.280 --> 23:38.008
- On a good
night they could get

23:38.120 --> 23:41.602
- between 200 or 300 quid.
- Good evening, Mr. Tchai.

23:41.720 --> 23:43.768
- Evening.

23:43.880 --> 23:46.360
- Mr. Tchai always loves
to sit at that table.

23:46.480 --> 23:49.245
- And only with Bella.
- Does he win?

23:49.360 --> 23:51.044
- He's a good customer.

23:51.200 --> 23:53.965
- A good customer
is a consistent loser.

23:54.120 --> 23:56.327
But is that
what he meant?

23:58.320 --> 24:00.891
- Where do you live, Jack?
- Over the river.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.646
- You got transport?
- No.

24:03.760 --> 24:04.647
- I'm going over the river.
- I'll give you a lift

24:04.760 --> 24:07.923
- if you like.
- Nice one, thanks.

24:32.040 --> 24:34.327
- So how do you feel?
- Your first night on the job?

24:34.440 --> 24:37.284
Bet you're on a high.

24:37.400 --> 24:40.085
- Nice car.
- She's my baby.

24:40.200 --> 24:42.362
- So how long have you
worked at the casino?

24:42.480 --> 24:44.642
- Coming up to
two years now.

24:44.760 --> 24:47.161
But I was away
for six months.

24:47.280 --> 24:49.282
- Looks like you've
done pretty well.

24:49.400 --> 24:52.563
- Not bad. I have other
interests, of course.

24:52.720 --> 24:54.768
Listen, I'm off to
a little watering hole.

24:54.880 --> 24:57.247
Have a few drinks, relax.
Want to join me?

24:57.360 --> 24:59.010
- No thanks.

24:59.120 --> 25:02.567
I'm gonna go home.
I need my eight hours.

25:02.680 --> 25:05.001
- I bet you five to one
you won't get any sleep.

25:05.120 --> 25:07.168
You've got to unwind in
this job, Jack...

25:07.280 --> 25:09.886
Or it'll kill you.
I mean that.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.651
- Some other time.

25:39.680 --> 25:41.808
- What time is it?

25:41.920 --> 25:44.127
- No idea.

25:46.960 --> 25:50.521
- How did it go?
- Yeah, fine.

25:54.720 --> 25:58.520
- You're shaking.
- What is it?

25:58.640 --> 26:01.325
- It's just tension.
- It'll go.

26:01.440 --> 26:05.445
- Poor baby.

26:05.560 --> 26:08.723
This'll relax you.

26:12.520 --> 26:15.683
- I loved it blonde.
- Oh look, it's only hair.

26:16.880 --> 26:19.121
I haven't changed.

26:26.400 --> 26:28.084
- When you come
home, I'm asleep.

26:28.200 --> 26:29.804
When I leave home,
you're asleep.

26:29.920 --> 26:33.527
- Mmm.

26:33.640 --> 26:36.769
- Bye.

26:36.880 --> 26:39.565
- I'll see you
in my dreams.

27:14.480 --> 27:16.528
- 2O fives.

27:16.640 --> 27:18.404
- Change.

27:20.640 --> 27:22.369
500.

27:26.640 --> 27:29.450
Money down.

27:29.560 --> 27:30.971
Place your
bets, please.

27:33.080 --> 27:36.323
- Two, six, 13.

27:36.440 --> 27:37.407
Jack could see this woman

27:37.520 --> 27:40.444
was an experienced gambler.
Professionals always place

27:40.560 --> 27:42.369
their bets through
the croupier.

27:42.480 --> 27:44.801
That way there
are no comebacks.

27:44.920 --> 27:48.049
- One, five, 16,
and the neighbors.

27:48.160 --> 27:50.401
No more bets.
Thank you.

27:52.320 --> 27:54.243
13 black.

28:08.080 --> 28:09.923
Eight seven five.

28:13.720 --> 28:16.246
Place your bets, please.

28:16.360 --> 28:20.570
- Two, six, 13.
- Two, six, 13.

28:20.680 --> 28:23.843
- Orphans.
- Orphans by 25. 125 the bet.

28:23.960 --> 28:26.725
- Orphans.
- Orphans by five.

28:26.840 --> 28:30.765
- One, five, 16
and the neighbors.

28:30.880 --> 28:33.451
No more bets.
Thank you.

28:35.480 --> 28:38.324
- 34 red. No, I'm sorry, sir.
- That's a late bet.

28:38.440 --> 28:42.001
- What are you talking about?
- 34, I won with this lady.

28:42.120 --> 28:44.361
- No. You've won with the chips
you placed earlier,

28:44.480 --> 28:46.323
But the bet on 34
was a late bet.

28:46.440 --> 28:48.966
- I put it all together.
- I'm afraid that's not so, sir.

28:49.120 --> 28:51.521
- Now look here, I--
- Is there a problem?

28:51.640 --> 28:54.689
- Yes! This croupier is
accusing me of cheating.

28:54.800 --> 28:57.280
Do you think I cheated?

28:57.400 --> 29:00.244
- In my opinion,
it was a late bet.

29:00.360 --> 29:01.850
- I think we should
talk about this...

29:01.960 --> 29:02.927
away from
the table.

29:03.040 --> 29:06.886
- No, I won.
- I want to be paid.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.766
- Pay the gentleman.
- In full. Now.

29:22.920 --> 29:24.046
We'd better talk
in my office sir.

29:24.160 --> 29:25.889
- Why?
- We paid you out this time,

29:26.000 --> 29:27.889
but I'm afraid you won't
be welcome here again.

29:32.600 --> 29:35.251
- You bastard!
- On your way, please, sir.

29:42.680 --> 29:44.569
- 1300.

29:47.640 --> 29:48.971
I'm sorry, madam.
We're not allowed

29:49.080 --> 29:51.686
to accept gratuities
in the UK.

29:51.800 --> 29:53.689
It's different
in South Africa.

29:53.800 --> 29:56.201
- You know where I'm from.
- I've lived there.

29:56.320 --> 29:58.721
- Well, thank
you anyway.

29:58.840 --> 30:00.080
Bright woman, he thought.

30:00.200 --> 30:03.488
She knew the rule of gold.
Place your bets, please.

30:03.600 --> 30:06.729
Quit when
you're ahead.

30:28.040 --> 30:30.486
Matt, listen.

30:30.640 --> 30:33.166
There's something
I've got to say to you.

30:33.280 --> 30:35.203
- I saw you cheating.
- What the fuck

30:35.320 --> 30:37.527
- are you talking about?
- That Greek guy at the end.

30:37.640 --> 30:39.847
You paid him out
25s, not 10s.

30:39.960 --> 30:41.769
- You got it wrong, Jack.
- I don't cheat.

30:41.880 --> 30:43.769
- I'm not gonna
report it.

30:51.560 --> 30:52.971
- What are you, a fucking cop?
- But if I see you

30:53.120 --> 30:55.361
doing it again,
I will.

30:55.480 --> 30:58.086
- I don't get you. Even if it
was true, which it isn't,

30:58.200 --> 31:00.009
what the fuck difference
would it make to you?

31:00.120 --> 31:01.690
- Because if the supervisor
knew that I'd seen it

31:01.800 --> 31:03.643
and didn't report it,
then I'd lose my job,

31:03.760 --> 31:07.207
- and I can't afford that.
- Oh, so it's Mr. Clean.

31:07.320 --> 31:10.085
Wise up, Jack. This
whole business is bent.

31:10.200 --> 31:12.726
The casino's nothing but
legal theft, and that's okay.

31:12.840 --> 31:15.127
It's the system.
Half the punters

31:15.240 --> 31:18.369
who come in here are using
stolen money. Drugs money.

31:18.520 --> 31:19.806
They haven't
even earned it.

31:19.920 --> 31:22.685
We earn our money.

31:22.800 --> 31:25.724
I'm on your side, Jack.
I don't need an enemy.

31:25.840 --> 31:28.446
- You're talking
about complicity.

31:28.560 --> 31:30.244
- I don't even know
what that means.

31:30.360 --> 31:33.409
I'm talking about
not rocking the boat.

31:33.520 --> 31:35.602
Matt was an escape artist.

31:38.320 --> 31:41.051
- Like Jack's father.
- Okay.

31:41.160 --> 31:44.050
Now, let's unwind.

31:57.720 --> 32:01.770
Hey, Andros.

32:01.880 --> 32:03.530
- This is Jack.
- Hello.

32:03.640 --> 32:05.529
- How you doing?

32:16.600 --> 32:19.922
- Blackjack.
- One blackjack and... drink?

32:20.080 --> 32:21.764
- Vodka, straight
on the rocks.

32:21.880 --> 32:24.963
- Vodka straight
coming up.

32:25.080 --> 32:27.082
- Who are these guys'?
- A few drug dealers.

32:27.200 --> 32:29.521
- Mostly people that work
In the casino business.

32:32.880 --> 32:35.087
- And the girls?
- Just girls.

32:35.200 --> 32:38.044
- Blackjack,
and vodka straight.

32:41.080 --> 32:43.481
- Does Bella come here?
- The bitch? No.

32:43.600 --> 32:46.490
- Matt, you want in?
- Yeah, why not?

32:54.240 --> 32:56.083
- Jack, join us?

32:56.240 --> 32:57.480
- No thanks.

32:57.600 --> 32:58.840
- I won't report you.

32:58.960 --> 33:02.203
- I don't gamble.

33:02.320 --> 33:06.689
- You don't gamble?
- But do you smoke?

33:06.800 --> 33:09.121
- Sometimes.

33:09.240 --> 33:12.130
- How about now?

33:16.320 --> 33:18.971
- Same again, yeah?
- Coming up.

33:33.800 --> 33:37.009
Marion, I'm on my way.

33:43.680 --> 33:46.206
- All right, lads.
- Divvy up.

33:46.320 --> 33:48.687
- Listen, I'm gonna get off.
- I need to sleep.

33:48.800 --> 33:51.246
- Loosen up, Jack. If you don't,
this job will get to you.

33:51.360 --> 33:53.601
Pressure's too much.
Believe me, It'll break you.

33:53.760 --> 33:56.491
- The world
breaks everyone.

33:56.600 --> 33:59.968
And afterwards many are
strong at the broken places.

34:02.760 --> 34:04.922
- Ernest Hemingway.

34:07.600 --> 34:09.967
- Wasn't he the one
who shot himself?

34:38.520 --> 34:40.170
- Where have
you been?

34:40.280 --> 34:42.806
- I've got to give evidence
In court at nine.

34:42.920 --> 34:45.366
- Don't play the policewoman
with me, Marion.

34:47.040 --> 34:51.011
- Take that back!
- Fucking take that back!

34:51.120 --> 34:54.681
- Yeah, I take it back. You're
not in the police anymore.

34:54.800 --> 34:57.531
You're a store
detective.

34:57.640 --> 34:59.483
- Are you drunk?

34:59.600 --> 35:02.206
- Probably.

35:02.320 --> 35:04.243
- This fucking job's
getting to you.

35:04.360 --> 35:06.249
You haven't written a fucking
word since it started.

35:06.360 --> 35:07.646
- Do you have to
swear all the time?

35:07.760 --> 35:10.286
- Well, that's my poor
upbringing.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.448
I didn't go to
private school.

35:12.560 --> 35:16.201
I haven't got
any class.

35:16.320 --> 35:18.368
I wanna live
with a writer.

35:18.480 --> 35:20.847
Not a fucking
croupier.

35:20.960 --> 35:23.122
I don't even know
what the word means.

35:23.240 --> 35:26.084
- Croupier.
- Marion, stop this.

35:27.200 --> 35:29.487
- What do I mean to you?

35:31.720 --> 35:33.882
I want to know.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.766
Tell me.

35:37.880 --> 35:40.451
- You're my conscience.

35:44.920 --> 35:47.571
- Haven't you got a
conscience of your own?

36:03.920 --> 36:06.321
- Fuck. Shit!

36:42.160 --> 36:43.730
- Fancy a drink
after work?

36:43.840 --> 36:46.411
- What are you doing here?
- You know the rules.

36:48.120 --> 36:50.009
I don't finish till 9:00.

36:50.120 --> 36:53.090
Shit. I'm on at 9:00.

36:54.320 --> 36:58.120
- That's our life
now, isn't it?

37:20.640 --> 37:23.371
Thinking of
going back?

37:23.480 --> 37:26.689
- Oh, my god. Hello.

37:26.800 --> 37:30.202
- You know what?
- I'd like to buy you a drink.

37:30.320 --> 37:32.163
- It's against the rules.

37:32.280 --> 37:34.521
Dealers are forbidden
to talk to punters.

37:34.640 --> 37:37.041
- What are the odds of
you being seen with me?

37:37.160 --> 37:40.403
- Impossible to calculate.

37:40.520 --> 37:42.329
- It's a coincidence.

37:45.720 --> 37:49.122
- You know, there's a
casino in this hotel.

37:49.240 --> 37:51.686
- I'm not really
much of a gambler.

37:51.800 --> 37:54.246
I just like this bar.

37:54.360 --> 37:56.249
- First visit
to London?

37:56.360 --> 37:59.125
- No. No, I come every
couple of years.

37:59.240 --> 38:02.164
I always plan
to stay, but...

38:03.600 --> 38:05.364
I'm from Cape
Town originally.

38:05.480 --> 38:08.643
- I was born in the Transkei.
- On the wild coast.

38:08.760 --> 38:10.364
- Near the casino.

38:10.480 --> 38:12.323
- In the casino.

38:12.440 --> 38:13.771
Now there's a coincidence.

38:13.880 --> 38:15.530
My father used
to gamble there.

38:15.640 --> 38:17.244
Your father?

38:17.360 --> 38:19.203
I loved the
atmosphere.

38:19.320 --> 38:22.642
But it destroyed
my mother.

38:22.760 --> 38:25.843
- The debts?
- And the lies.

38:25.960 --> 38:29.681
- Gamblers are born liars.
- And superstitious too.

38:30.840 --> 38:35.004
- It's like witchcraft.
- That's Africa.

38:35.120 --> 38:38.090
There's an African in
all of us, isn't there?

38:38.200 --> 38:41.727
- We all came from
Africa supposedly.

38:41.880 --> 38:45.441
- Do you believe in astrology?
- Absolutely not.

38:46.600 --> 38:48.523
But then I'm a Gemini,
and Geminis don't

38:48.680 --> 38:52.048
believe in astrology.

38:52.160 --> 38:55.562
- You know, you don't strike me
as a typical croupier.

38:58.200 --> 39:00.441
Ah, I'm not married.

39:00.560 --> 39:01.607
I just wear it to
keep the flies off.

39:01.720 --> 39:05.645
Look, I have to go.

39:07.320 --> 39:09.846
- Let me pay for this.
- Absolutely not.

39:09.960 --> 39:12.201
- Toss you for it.
- I don't gamble.

39:15.440 --> 39:18.523
- I know this
is verboten, but...

39:18.640 --> 39:20.165
if you feel
like a chat,

39:20.280 --> 39:23.727
or maybe dinner,
give me a call.

39:26.840 --> 39:29.161
I'll understand
if you don't.

39:29.280 --> 39:32.170
But I hope
that you do.

39:39.720 --> 39:41.882
- Jack started to
dress for the casino at home.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.446
A man in love
with his uniform.

39:44.560 --> 39:47.370
Like a musician in his tuxedo
going to the concert hall

39:47.480 --> 39:50.450
on public transport.
Eager to perform.

39:55.840 --> 39:57.683
- No more bets.
- Thank you.

39:59.560 --> 40:00.368
- 19 red.

40:04.400 --> 40:06.004
- Animal!

40:06.120 --> 40:09.044
- The croupier
registered disgust.

40:09.160 --> 40:11.686
This gentleman's accidentally
coughed on the chips.

40:11.800 --> 40:14.485
- The writer made a note.
Good scene for the book.

40:14.640 --> 40:16.961
- Agnes, take these chips
off the table for me.

40:20.400 --> 40:22.164
- I can't give you
a lift back tonight.

40:22.280 --> 40:24.089
- Don't worry
about it.

40:35.560 --> 40:38.245
- See you, Jack.
- Yeah, see you.

40:42.520 --> 40:44.522
0 Jack, do you
want a lift?

40:44.640 --> 40:47.723
- No. I'm okay, thanks.

40:47.880 --> 40:51.521
- Maybe some other time.
- I'll take you up on that.

40:58.080 --> 41:00.526
- Hey, you don't
recognize me?

41:00.640 --> 41:02.563
You had me barred,
you fucking little worm.

41:02.680 --> 41:04.330
- If I remember rightly,
you got yourself barred.

41:04.480 --> 41:06.687
- No, it was you,
you shit.

41:36.040 --> 41:38.088
- Jack! Jack!

41:38.200 --> 41:40.771
Come on,
leave him.

41:40.880 --> 41:43.804
Jack, you don't want
the police here, come on.

41:52.880 --> 41:54.723
Jack!

41:57.160 --> 41:59.640
- He won't cheat again.

42:13.600 --> 42:15.807
- You're shaking.

42:15.920 --> 42:19.163
- It's nothing.
- It's just tension.

42:23.280 --> 42:25.886
Oh... Fuck!

42:36.840 --> 42:39.207
Oh, shit!

42:56.800 --> 42:58.086
It's funny,
isn't it?

42:58.200 --> 43:01.249
If that bloke hadn't have come
over, you wouldn't be here now.

43:05.800 --> 43:09.441
- I hate cheats.

43:09.560 --> 43:12.166
- All men
are cheats.

43:12.280 --> 43:14.965
- Are they?

43:15.080 --> 43:17.560
- Fools.

43:19.320 --> 43:22.403
I spent a year
on the game.

43:22.520 --> 43:25.649
Don't worry. I'm clean
as a whistle.

43:25.760 --> 43:27.524
I only did S and M.

43:27.640 --> 43:30.803
No blowjobs.
No screwing.

43:30.960 --> 43:33.122
- Why did you stop?

43:34.600 --> 43:37.410
- Got scared.

43:37.520 --> 43:41.161
- Yeah. I can imagine.
- Can you?

43:44.640 --> 43:47.086
Anyway, I'm happy
being a dealer now.

43:47.200 --> 43:48.804
At least the punters keep
their hands to themselves,

43:48.920 --> 43:52.447
even if the other
dealers don't.

43:52.560 --> 43:55.564
- You called
the casino a cesspit.

43:55.680 --> 43:58.331
- Well, it is.

43:58.440 --> 44:01.728
But at least
I know where I am.

44:01.840 --> 44:04.764
I've been watching you work.
You're good.

44:04.880 --> 44:07.406
Too fucking good
for that place.

44:09.120 --> 44:11.566
- I despise the job.

44:11.680 --> 44:14.126
- If you hate it so much,
why do you do it?

44:14.240 --> 44:15.287
Jack suddenly
had the feeling that

44:15.400 --> 44:18.244
he was transparent, that Bella
could see right through him.

44:18.360 --> 44:21.364
- You've got a guilty look.
- We broke the rules.

44:21.480 --> 44:22.606
- Shit, he
hadn't meant to say that.

44:22.760 --> 44:23.921
She'd caught
him unawares.

44:24.040 --> 44:25.485
- You're certainly different
from the others.

44:25.640 --> 44:26.641
Careful.

44:26.760 --> 44:29.889
This liaison, forbidden in
the casino family, was incest.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.891
- Not like Matt, you mean.
- Now there's a real shit.

44:34.440 --> 44:37.569
Don't get
friendly with him.

44:37.680 --> 44:39.728
Do you know what
he said to me once?

44:39.840 --> 44:43.561
I wanna fuck the whole world
over, that's my mission.

44:43.680 --> 44:47.685
Stupid little shit.

44:47.800 --> 44:49.802
Thank you, Bella.

44:54.040 --> 44:57.487
Jack could hear
Matt saying it.

44:57.600 --> 45:00.968
I want to fuck the whole world
over, it's my mission.

45:03.800 --> 45:07.202
Eureka. Jack
had struck gold.

45:07.320 --> 45:10.529
He'd found a protagonist
for his book.

45:10.640 --> 45:13.246
Little Matt.

45:13.360 --> 45:16.091
- Chapter one.
- I look like shit.

45:16.200 --> 45:18.089
- Rough day?
- Rough life, Jack.

45:18.200 --> 45:20.009
Rough life.

45:24.800 --> 45:27.724
- Hi. I'm Pat.
- Hello.

45:27.840 --> 45:29.729
- See you, boys.
- What happened to Bella?

45:29.840 --> 45:32.002
- I'll tell
you later.

45:34.600 --> 45:36.409
- Change.

45:36.520 --> 45:39.205
$5,000.

45:39.320 --> 45:42.529
- What has happened to Bella?
- What's happened to Bella?

45:42.640 --> 45:43.926
- She's been re-assigned.

45:44.040 --> 45:47.362
- Not re-assigned,
just written out of the story.

45:47.480 --> 45:49.960
- Good evening.

45:50.080 --> 45:51.844
- Hundreds.

45:51.960 --> 45:54.850
- Change. 1,000.

45:56.800 --> 45:59.041
- Now this
was no coincidence.

46:09.640 --> 46:11.483
Fifteen,

46:11.600 --> 46:14.080
Too many.

46:14.200 --> 46:17.170
20,18,19,17...

46:18.480 --> 46:19.925
Nineteen.

46:20.040 --> 46:22.486
Did she think
he'd bring her luck'?

46:24.120 --> 46:26.248
- Can I get
anything for you?

46:30.000 --> 46:32.924
- 14.
- Why had she come?

46:33.040 --> 46:34.041
Too many.

46:34.160 --> 46:35.730
Did she want
him to help her win?

46:35.840 --> 46:37.842
Eleven double.

46:37.960 --> 46:39.007
Twenty one.

46:39.120 --> 46:42.806
18,17,17...

46:42.920 --> 46:46.891
13, 20.

46:53.840 --> 46:54.648
Change.

46:54.760 --> 46:55.727
He knew
how to fix it for her.

46:55.840 --> 46:57.524
$1,000.

46:57.640 --> 46:59.768
His father
had taught him the trick.

47:04.360 --> 47:05.521
The casino
wouldn't spot it,

47:05.640 --> 47:09.201
but Jack was wary
of the punters.

47:09.320 --> 47:11.448
11 double.

47:12.480 --> 47:14.721
He could see Mr.
Tchai was counting.

47:14.840 --> 47:16.888
He couldn't risk it.

47:20.520 --> 47:23.171
12.

47:23.280 --> 47:24.406
20.

47:24.520 --> 47:27.683
18, 18, 17...

47:29.480 --> 47:30.925
19.

47:31.040 --> 47:32.610
She wasn't
wearing her ring.

47:32.720 --> 47:35.166
Odds on she'd sold it.

47:40.040 --> 47:43.328
- Thank you.
- Good night.

47:43.440 --> 47:44.851
- Good night.

47:44.960 --> 47:48.601
Thank you, she said.
For what, Jack thought.

47:48.760 --> 47:51.843
He ought to thank her.

47:51.960 --> 47:53.485
- Pretty woman.

47:53.640 --> 47:55.881
- Jani De Villiers
had just entered his book.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.401
Place your bets, please.

48:10.520 --> 48:13.330
- Yeah.
- How's it going, Jacko?

48:13.440 --> 48:16.250
- Fine. I took that job.
- Good for you.

48:16.360 --> 48:17.407
- I was wondering
what was happening.

48:17.520 --> 48:18.487
- Yeah, well, I
tried to call you,

48:18.600 --> 48:20.523
but they said your
line was disconnected.

48:20.640 --> 48:22.290
- Ah, yes.

48:22.400 --> 48:25.563
I moved house.
I needed a bigger place.

48:25.680 --> 48:27.205
- How's that book
of yours coming on?

48:27.320 --> 48:30.085
- Yeah. I'm
getting there.

48:30.200 --> 48:31.122
- Well, it's a good job
you've got the job

48:31.240 --> 48:33.208
to fall back on,
isn't it? Huh?

48:33.320 --> 48:36.403
Oh, there's my
other line. Ciao.

48:51.720 --> 48:53.688
- I don't like it.

48:56.960 --> 48:58.928
- Why not?

48:59.080 --> 49:02.209
- I don't like it at all.

49:02.320 --> 49:05.290
It had a wonderful
character before.

49:05.400 --> 49:07.368
The gambler was
so romantic.

49:07.480 --> 49:09.926
- He was a loser.

49:10.040 --> 49:13.761
This guy's a croupier,
he can't lose.

49:13.880 --> 49:15.405
People have shat on
him all his life,

49:15.520 --> 49:18.649
and now he's in control.
He's a winner.

49:18.760 --> 49:21.525
- Is that your
idea of a winner?

49:21.640 --> 49:24.086
He couldn't give a shit about
anyone. He uses people--

49:24.200 --> 49:25.611
- It's because of
the sex, isn't it?

49:25.720 --> 49:27.961
You don't like
the sex in it.

49:28.080 --> 49:30.526
- I couldn't give
a fuck about the sex.

49:30.640 --> 49:32.483
Most men will
fuck a lamppost.

49:32.600 --> 49:36.207
He's just a
miserable zombie.

49:36.320 --> 49:39.802
Is that the way
you feel now?

49:39.920 --> 49:41.570
Is that what's
happened to you?

49:41.680 --> 49:44.524
- Marion, it's a book.

49:44.640 --> 49:47.246
- Really? Then why
is he called Jake?

49:47.360 --> 49:50.204
Why don't you come
clean, and call him Jack?

49:52.080 --> 49:55.880
There's no
hope in it.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.526
- It's the truth.

49:58.680 --> 50:00.887
- Without hope, there's
no point to anything.

50:01.000 --> 50:04.129
- What is so fucking
hopeful about your job?

50:04.240 --> 50:06.925
Spending the day catching
poor people stealing?

50:07.040 --> 50:09.281
You said yourself the organized
gangs get away with it.

50:09.440 --> 50:11.249
At least in the casino
everyone gets caught.

50:11.400 --> 50:14.370
Rich or poor, the odds are
the same, it's all relative.

50:14.480 --> 50:18.280
- Crap! It is not
relative. It's unfair.

50:18.400 --> 50:21.370
- It's designed unfair,
like your casino, and your

50:21.480 --> 50:24.165
croupier's a little shit,
because he goes along with it.

50:24.280 --> 50:26.886
- Yeah? What
about the lottery?

50:27.040 --> 50:28.883
Look at this, you're just like

50:29.000 --> 50:30.445
all the other
suckers out there.

50:30.560 --> 50:33.484
14 and a half million to one,
is that your idea of hope?

50:33.600 --> 50:34.965
- The door, Jack.
- Leave it.

50:35.080 --> 50:37.481
- No. Answer it.

50:47.440 --> 50:50.125
- Just called round to say
thanks for shopping me, Jack.

50:52.120 --> 50:54.487
- What are you
talking about?

50:54.600 --> 50:57.171
- Reynolds got a doctor in. They
forced me to do a dope test

50:57.320 --> 50:59.448
which was positive,
as you knew.

50:59.560 --> 51:01.324
- I don't know
anything about it.

51:02.520 --> 51:04.443
- Hiya.
- Hi.

51:04.560 --> 51:06.289
- Your boyfriend fucked me,
smoked my dope,

51:06.400 --> 51:09.449
and then shopped me.
What do you think about that?

51:09.560 --> 51:13.451
I can't get a job now.
You're no different from Matt.

51:13.560 --> 51:16.166
Pair of vicious little shits,
that's what you are.

51:16.280 --> 51:18.089
- Bella, I don't know
anything about this.

51:18.200 --> 51:20.851
- All men are scumbags.
- I agree.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.844
Go on.
Go after her.

51:35.600 --> 51:39.650
- He was Jack...
and he was Jake.

51:39.760 --> 51:41.410
And he had discovered
there was a price to pay

51:41.520 --> 51:43.887
for this double
life of his.

51:46.560 --> 51:50.610
He had no idea where Marion
was staying, or with whom.

51:50.720 --> 51:53.929
He realized he knew little
about her life, but then...

51:54.040 --> 51:56.042
He had never
asked about it.

52:06.720 --> 52:08.085
For the first time
in a long while,

52:08.200 --> 52:10.202
Jack thought about
his mother.

52:10.320 --> 52:12.448
She'd left when she
couldn't take it any more.

52:12.560 --> 52:16.246
His father had said, don't worry
Jack, oh, she'll come back.

52:16.400 --> 52:18.971
She didn't.

52:19.080 --> 52:21.560
But Marion wasn't
his mother.

52:23.800 --> 52:26.246
He's paying out
twenty-fives, not tens.

52:26.360 --> 52:29.125
- I see that.

52:29.240 --> 52:31.004
Little shit, Matt.

52:31.120 --> 52:33.009
- Chapter three:
His existence was forming

52:33.120 --> 52:35.122
an interesting pattern
of betrayals.

52:35.240 --> 52:36.571
Sometimes he was
unsure whether

52:36.680 --> 52:38.284
he was the betrayer
or the betrayed.

52:38.400 --> 52:39.811
- Thanks for the
information.

52:39.920 --> 52:41.968
- Pleasure.

52:42.080 --> 52:44.287
Pity about Bella.

52:44.400 --> 52:47.244
- She was a real asset.

52:47.360 --> 52:49.362
What could I do?

52:51.800 --> 52:54.883
Sorry, Jack.
No smoking in the nest.

53:02.080 --> 53:04.208
- Thank you, sir.

53:04.320 --> 53:07.164
- Fantastic, brilliant.
- Just down the side.

53:08.480 --> 53:11.051
Jack?

53:11.160 --> 53:13.288
I thought it was you,
It's the hair.

53:13.400 --> 53:15.243
- Listen, I'm working
on that soccer story.

53:15.360 --> 53:17.886
- Right. Look, I must
get back to Habib.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.924
- Habib?
- He's my author.

53:21.040 --> 53:23.520
He's a terrorist. He's written
a kill-and-tell book.

53:23.640 --> 53:26.530
Take care.

53:28.480 --> 53:30.209
- That's 4.99, sir.
- Thank you.

53:30.320 --> 53:32.209
- Jack...

53:32.320 --> 53:35.290
Look, next weekend
I'm having a house party.

53:36.960 --> 53:40.203
Here. It's just
near Oxford.

53:41.360 --> 53:42.930
Why don't
you come?

53:43.040 --> 53:45.281
It'll just be
social, no business.

53:45.400 --> 53:48.051
Bring a friend, I've
got plenty of room.

53:48.200 --> 53:49.964
- I'll try and make it.
- Good.

53:50.120 --> 53:52.327
Looking forward.

53:52.440 --> 53:54.408
Right!

53:57.000 --> 53:59.002
- Your change, sir.
- Thanks.

54:02.000 --> 54:03.764
Books piled like chips.

54:03.880 --> 54:06.929
Stack 'em high, sell 'em
fast, make a killing.

54:07.040 --> 54:09.168
No dumb soccer
novel for Jack.

54:09.280 --> 54:11.567
He would write about
the world he knew.

54:11.680 --> 54:13.762
From the inside.

54:15.760 --> 54:17.728
Chapter four.

54:26.520 --> 54:29.205
I don't know how you can
drive at night in those glasses.

54:33.200 --> 54:35.009
How'd you hurt
your hand?

54:35.120 --> 54:37.930
- Oh, it was just an accident.
- It's nothing.

54:39.160 --> 54:41.606
- Should be the
next on the right.

54:44.240 --> 54:47.244
Jani, there's something I want
to say before we get there.

54:47.360 --> 54:50.204
I don't know what the
sleeping arrangements are.

54:50.320 --> 54:53.403
Giles probably expects
us to share a room.

54:53.560 --> 54:55.767
- That's fine.

55:09.960 --> 55:13.407
Look.

55:13.520 --> 55:16.364
It's no use pretending
it was an accident.

55:16.480 --> 55:19.643
I had a fight with someone.
That's all.

55:31.960 --> 55:34.566
- She's a dab hand with
the racket, your friend.

55:35.840 --> 55:37.649
- South African women
are very sporty.

55:37.760 --> 55:39.922
- So I see.

55:44.680 --> 55:46.170
- Nice serve.

55:46.320 --> 55:48.561
- 14-15.

55:48.680 --> 55:52.002
- How did she
get that shiner?

55:52.160 --> 55:54.925
- I found her in
bed with someone.

55:55.080 --> 55:57.924
- Who was he?
- She.

56:00.040 --> 56:01.724
- I say, you're a
dark horse, Jack.

56:01.840 --> 56:04.446
- Lovely shot.
- Nice game.

56:07.520 --> 56:10.126
- Come on, Jack.
- I don't gamble.

56:10.240 --> 56:12.561
- Don't be a spoil-sport.
- It's only a few quid.

56:12.720 --> 56:14.961
- It's nothing to do with
money. I don't gamble.

56:15.080 --> 56:17.048
- He doesn't gamble.

56:25.600 --> 56:27.011
- I'll watch.

56:27.120 --> 56:29.964
- Jack likes to watch.

56:30.080 --> 56:31.969
Does he like to watch?

56:32.080 --> 56:35.448
- One more remark like that,
and I'll break your balls.

56:37.720 --> 56:40.849
I bet she could too.

56:41.000 --> 56:44.322
- I'll deal, but
I won't play.

56:44.440 --> 56:46.681
- Sure you know how?

56:49.960 --> 56:52.930
The hands of a conjurer.

56:54.840 --> 56:58.686
Or a cardsharp.

57:17.240 --> 57:21.040
- Okay, last hand.
- I've got an idea.

57:21.160 --> 57:23.049
- No. No stripping.

57:23.160 --> 57:26.881
- Right, we're not having
that again. Although...

57:28.480 --> 57:30.448
- I'll stick to bluffing.

57:30.560 --> 57:32.722
That's what I'm best at.

57:34.000 --> 57:35.445
Stick.

57:35.560 --> 57:37.642
- Stick.

57:37.760 --> 57:40.684
- I don't know.
- Two cards.

57:40.800 --> 57:42.609
- Two cards.
- Two cards.

57:42.720 --> 57:44.245
- Two cards.

57:44.360 --> 57:47.204
One card.

57:47.320 --> 57:49.322
- One card.

57:49.440 --> 57:52.171
- Three cards.
- Three.

57:55.560 --> 57:58.291
- I'll start With...

57:58.400 --> 58:01.961
a tenner.

58:02.120 --> 58:05.249
- I'll see your ten
and I'll raise you ten.

58:05.360 --> 58:08.330
- I'll see your 2O
and raise you ten.

58:14.040 --> 58:16.281
- Thirty, raise ten.

58:18.720 --> 58:20.927
- Forty-

58:21.040 --> 58:24.328
Raise you by 20.

58:24.480 --> 58:27.882
- I'll match that,
and raise you a tenner.

58:33.760 --> 58:36.604
- I'm in.

58:36.720 --> 58:39.963
- Yes, that's it. I haven't
got any more cash.

58:41.080 --> 58:42.650
- Yeah.

58:42.760 --> 58:44.762
- I call.

58:44.880 --> 58:46.848
- See you.

58:49.440 --> 58:52.489
- A straight.
- Beat that.

58:52.600 --> 58:55.001
A flush.

58:55.120 --> 58:56.610
- Oh Shit.

58:56.760 --> 59:01.209
- Not so fast, darling.
- A full house.

59:01.320 --> 59:03.971
- Hang on, chaps,
that's impossible.

59:04.960 --> 59:07.691
- Well how's about
this for impossible?

59:07.800 --> 59:09.450
Four of a kind.

59:09.560 --> 59:10.800
What's going on?

59:10.920 --> 59:14.242
- No.

59:14.400 --> 59:16.402
- Straight flush.

59:16.520 --> 59:17.931
- What are the odds
of this happening?

59:18.040 --> 59:21.806
- Thousands to one.
- 42,300,000 to one.

59:21.920 --> 59:23.365
- Approximately.

59:23.480 --> 59:25.847
- Could have won if
I'd been able to bluff.

59:27.400 --> 59:30.210
- I get it.

59:30.320 --> 59:32.482
- Get what?

59:33.720 --> 59:35.643
Are you accusing
me of cheating?

59:35.800 --> 59:37.802
- Good god, no.

59:37.920 --> 59:40.571
With a skill like that,
why do you want a job for?

59:40.720 --> 59:43.007
You don't
need to work.

59:45.080 --> 59:47.367
- Here was
an interesting question.

59:47.520 --> 59:50.171
Was writing work?

59:50.280 --> 59:52.408
Qr play?

59:54.120 --> 59:56.930
- What happened?

59:57.040 --> 01:00:00.089
- Remember that guy who
cheated at the table?

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:02.607
- You don't like
cheats, do you?

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:21.684
So, which side
do you like?

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.851
- You choose.

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:43.565
- That trick
tonight.

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.682
I don't think I've ever
seen that done before.

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:47.529
- It can only work
with amateurs.

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:50.166
- A pro would have spotted it.
- I didn't.

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.442
- Then you're
not a pro.

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.003
- Good night.

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:09.169
Jack.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:14.886
- Jack.
- What?

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.923
- I need your help.

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.969
I'm in a lot
of trouble.

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:25.524
- What kind
of trouble?

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:28.405
- I owe a lot
of money.

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:30.727
- Was that why you
did that two grand?

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:33.730
- I couldn't help you.
- I know that.

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:35.569
But you can now.

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:38.650
- I'm sorry, I don't
have any money.

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.922
- Some people I know.

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:43.441
They're planning to
rob the Golden Lion.

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:48.410
- You don't mean that.
- They mean it.

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:50.887
- Who's they?
- My creditors.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.241
One night, around 3:00
in the morning,

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:55.840
- they'll come into the casino...
- Forget it Jani.

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.450
It'll never work.

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:02.566
- The point is, they
want a man inside.

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:04.364
- And I took you
for a bright woman.

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:07.404
- Just listen, You don't
have to do anything criminal.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:10.967
- Robbery's not criminal?
- You don't have to be criminal.

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:13.168
A guy will come up to your
table and deliberately cheat.

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:14.964
You'll see him,
stop him.

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:16.570
The guy will make a big
scene. There'll be chaos

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:19.968
and that's when
it'll happen.

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:22.651
- You're serious.

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.643
- You won't be
committing a crime.

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:26.370
The man will cheat, you'll
just be doing your job.

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:27.766
That's all.

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:29.848
- Shit.

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:32.930
- And I thought you were
only after my body.

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:37.202
- I've come to know you.

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:41.166
You're honest,
I can trust you.

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:43.800
- So what will you do
when it all goes wrong?

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:45.888
- It won't.
- But if it does.

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:49.807
- You'll keep
the 10,000 pounds.

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.925
- What 10,000 pounds?

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:57.560
- These people will pay
you 10,000 before,

01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:00.570
and 10,000 after.

01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:03.160
They want someone
they can be sure of.

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:07.490
An honest dealer.
That's the point.

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:10.888
Not all dealers
are honest.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.048
Mr. Reynolds will
never suspect you.

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:17.051
- Reynolds. You've
done your research.

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:20.960
- There was nothing
else I could do.

01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:23.447
You're my last chance.

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:27.801
Next time
it'll be my neck.

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:30.810
- What about my neck?

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:33.605
- I want to
go back to Cape Town.

01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:36.724
I want to
start again, clean.

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:42.923
<i>- Can't do xx, Jam.</i>

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:46.442
- I'm asking you
as a friend.

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:51.529
You'd be saving
the life of a friend.

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:23.446
- Jack wondered why
he was even considering it.

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:26.928
Ten grand... In cash.
That was why.

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:31.086
But Jack didn't
need the money.

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:32.850
His father would have
taken it like a shot,

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.928
but his father
was a gambler.

01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:38.965
He was always broke.

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:41.686
Jack suddenly realized:

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:45.122
It was Jake who
was considering it.

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:50.329
How much
do you owe?

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:53.171
- Let it go.

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:01.201
- Did they tell you
to sleep with me?

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:03.482
- I told you,
all bets are off.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.243
- I'm sorry.
- What for?

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:24.966
- I have to
take the car.

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:41.645
- Hang on tightly,
let go lightly.

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:43.842
Chapter five...

01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:58.720
- Good night?
- Not particularly.

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:00.683
- And your lady?

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:04.407
- She had to leave early.
- She asked me to thank you.

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:07.530
- Bit unexpected, wasn't it?
- Not really, no.

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:13.084
- How's that soccer
story coming along?

01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:16.687
- You said it was gonna be
social, Giles. No business.

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:19.041
He was overcome with
a sense of urgency.

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:21.885
He had to get it down.
Get on with the writing.

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:02.210
- It's beautiful,
Thank you.

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:07.563
- I hope it brings you luck.
- It will.

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:13.605
I haven't brought you
much luck, have I?

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:15.529
- Marion, that girl who
worked at the casino...

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:18.211
- I don't care
about her.

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:21.164
I was wrong what I
said about the book.

01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:24.045
I hurt you,
didn't I?

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.368
- I'm gonna leave the
casino soon, I promise.

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:35.369
- You Will?

01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:38.165
- Within a month.

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:43.487
Believe me.
I'm gonna quit.

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:52.210
- Then you can dye your
hair blonde again.

01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:08.323
- Nobody around. Leave
a message after the beep.

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:13.731
- I need to see you.
- I've moved.

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:15.490
I have a new number.

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:18.729
It's 4753275.

01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:21.446
Please call me.

01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:25.609
- Chapter seven.
Jake had decided to see her.

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:28.609
The challenge
was essential.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.127
- Come in.

01:08:46.359 --> 01:08:48.647
It's not the
Ritz, I'm afraid.

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:53.724
IS it yes?

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:56.684
- Yes.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:58.801
- Thank you.

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:13.370
- It doesn't seem fair.

01:09:13.479 --> 01:09:15.448
You're offering me
ten grand in cash.

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:17.403
You can't afford
a decent place.

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:19.488
- Life's not fair.
- We both know that.

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.488
- It's all relative,
I need money, too.

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:23.886
- Do you?
- Yes.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.649
- Look, the date's
not set yet.

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:28.331
But I'll call you.
One last thing.

01:09:28.439 --> 01:09:32.161
The man you're going to catch
cheating, he may get violent.

01:09:32.279 --> 01:09:34.886
But... you know how to
deal with cheats.

01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:39.444
- That bruise has
cleared up nicely.

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:41.767
- Bruise?

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:44.042
Yes. Yes, it's better.

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:47.727
- I've still got mine.
- And your hand, too.

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:51.406
- I took the bandage
off yesterday.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.841
- You want a drink?
- No, thank you.

01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:59.890
I don't think we
should meet again.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.970
It's a shame there aren't
more men in the world like you.

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:25.608
Question: was he
gambling, taking Jam's money?

01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:28.291
Answer: no.

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:31.290
Because he wasn't betting
with his own money.

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:33.926
He was being paid in
advance for a service.

01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:39.371
In reality, there were
two clear elements

01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:42.609
of risk in
this exchange.

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:46.566
One, the possibility
the cash was counterfeit.

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:49.405
Two, the possibility Jani
or her creditors

01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:51.887
would want the money back
if the plan failed.

01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:59.047
To begin with, he put the odds
at two against, seven for.

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:01.481
He checked a random
selection of bills at the bank.

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:03.568
They were all good.

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:06.650
- Bring me some
luck, darling.

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:08.285
- So now his odds
were decidedly better.

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:09.970
He put them
at eight to one.

01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:11.167
The fact that the notes
were good gave

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:13.089
him one less negative,
two minus one.

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.486
At the same time,
mathematically,

01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:17.809
he had one more positive.
Seven plus one.

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.291
Next stage.

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:21.004
He had to be secure
at eight to one.

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:22.360
Against having to give
the money back,

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:25.245
So he wouldn't
spend it.

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:29.167
If after one month no one
had approached him,

01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:32.523
He calculated the odds
of keeping it at 2O to one.

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:34.728
No more bets.
Thank you.

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:39.362
After three months,
he figured 100 to one

01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:41.409
no one would turn up.

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:48.926
36. Red.

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:02.089
8O pound.

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:13.366
- Cash me in.

01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:15.801
- How about a little
drink to celebrate?

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:29.162
- Jake's experiment with
the man would prove his point.

01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:31.482
People don't change.

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:43.249
- Damn.

01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:11.606
- Money down.

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:14.087
- Chapter ten.
He watched their faces

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:16.049
as they lost.

01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:18.965
Hour after hour,
night after night.

01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:21.407
Relentlessly.

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:23.249
He questioned the
conventional wisdom

01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:25.966
that gamblers are
self-destructive.

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:27.764
He had come to believe
that in reality,

01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:30.571
they want to destroy
everyone else.

01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:34.162
Their families,
loved ones, everyone.

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:39.245
Fuck over
the whole world.

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:41.966
Without emotion,
he watched them go.

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:46.327
Jake stayed.

01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:55.483
- Nobody around.
- Leave a message.

01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:00.007
- It's set. The day
after tomorrow.

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:03.164
The 24th.
Good luck.

01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:16.247
It's set. The day
after tomorrow.

01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:19.250
The 24th.
Good luck.

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:26.568
- Are you ever
tempted to gamble?

01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:28.444
- Never.

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:30.688
Why do you ask?

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.564
- I can just imagine
being around so much money

01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:35.650
- all the time.
- Gambling's not about money.

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:36.727
- Really?

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:38.888
Gambling's about
not facing reality,

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.891
- ignoring the odds.
- I must be a fool.

01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:45.721
I never think
about the odds.

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:50.649
♪ Jingle bells,
jingle all the way ♪

01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:53.240
♪ Oh, what fun
it is to ride ♪

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.968
Chapter 12.

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:22.642
- Change.

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:25.604
$2,500.

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:37.443
Money down.

01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:08.162
- Two seven five.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.968
New dealer.

01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:14.445
- Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:18.369
- Can I help you?

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:25.602
-18,18,17... 12.

01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:26.960
17, 20.

01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:28.286
No more cards.

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:30.243
Larger than ten.

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:39.680
- Place your bets, please.

01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:43.923
- 50.

01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:45.246
In tens.

01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:46.122
- Change.

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:48.129
<i>'50 pound.</i>

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.002
Money down.

01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:57.808
No more bets.
Thank you.

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:09.845
23 red.

01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:11.769
No, I'm sorry,
sir. Th...

01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:16.487
That was a late bet.

01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:19.331
- You calling me a cheat?
- You are a cheat.

01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:22.284
- I saw you.
- I'm talking to you.

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:24.084
- It was a la--

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:34.561
- Come on!

01:17:57.160 --> 01:17:59.481
- Ladies and gentlemen,
please be calm.

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:01.489
- There is no
cause for alarm.

01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:04.444
Enjoy yourselves.
It's Christmas.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.163
- How did you
know I was here?

01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:29.805
- I thought you wouldn't
want to spend Christmas Day

01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:32.400
alone in here.

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:38.927
- Did you go
to the casino?

01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:55.081
- Happy Christmas.

01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:59.047
Now...

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:04.649
Noodles or rice?

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:17.850
I don't want a criminal
for a boyfriend.

01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:23.490
- There was a message,
wasn't there?

01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:29.162
- It's probably easier
for you to eat the rice.

01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:33.001
- Marion. What did
you tell the police?

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:37.484
- Nothing about you.

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:39.682
- But then, what?

01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:44.846
- Give up being a croupier,
Jack, or I'll shop you.

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:48.729
All you have to do
is keep your promise.

01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:51.320
Simple.

01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:53.727
Here, use a spoon.

01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:57.242
- Leave me alone, Marion!

01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:00.443
- You're already alone.

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:02.801
- Marion! Marion!

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:07.209
Come here.

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:09.761
Come here.
Listen.

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:15.643
I really don't
want to lose you.

01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:18.047
<i>I'll quit.</i>

01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:20.561
I swear to you.

01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:34.486
- Why did you
take the money?

01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:37.325
- I hate public transport.

01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:39.408
- What?

01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:41.562
- I want to buy a car.

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:47.569
- How can anyone be that naive?

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:50.843
- So... how you feeling?
- Bruised.

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:55.044
- Take as long
as you like.

01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:57.646
Couple of weeks.
Three if you need it.

01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:00.491
We'll pay you
sick leave.

01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:02.523
Don't wanna
lose you, Jack.

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:06.486
You're a good man.

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:08.489
- What's this?
- Happy New Year.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.321
Have a drink
on the company.

01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:14.771
You've earned it.

01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:16.882
Chapter 13.

01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:22.807
It's all numbers,
the croupier thought.

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:26.288
Spin of the wheel,
turn of the card,

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:28.807
Time of your life,
date of your birth,

01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:32.720
Year of your death. In the book
of numbers, the Lord said...

01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:34.649
Thou shalt count thy steps.

01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:39.649
Jack thought,
this is it.

01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:42.411
The famous two-in-the-morning
knock at the door.

01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:44.124
It was payback time.

01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:47.164
But he wasn't afraid.

01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:50.841
He hadn't spent one
penny of the ten grand.

01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:54.169
He'd covered himself.
He knew the odds.

01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:57.443
- Mr. Manfred?

01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:23.081
- She was on
her way home.

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:24.884
- To you.
- No, she wasn't.

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:27.168
- Marion had been
visiting his mother. No, no, no.

01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:29.123
Not his mother,
her mother.

01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:31.641
Her mother. She was
visiting her mother.

01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:33.290
Who are you?

01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:36.131
- Detective Inspector Ross.
- Who?

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:39.806
- Ross.

01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:42.651
- Who did it?
- Tell me.

01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:46.362
- We think it's
a hit and run.

01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:49.410
A drunk driver,
probably.

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:52.729
There is the possibility
of a revenge killing.

01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:57.050
- Revenge? For what?
Whose revenge?

01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:59.931
- As you know, she was
a WPC with the met.

01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:02.646
Up until two years ago.

01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:05.570
She called me last week.

01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:09.526
She got wind of a planned
robbery at your casino.

01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:12.211
What had that
got to do with her death?

01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:16.489
- You didn't recognize the man
who attacked you, did you?

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:18.682
- Of course I fucking
recognized him.

01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:21.007
- You did?

01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:23.930
- I know a cheat
when I see one.

01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:29.006
- The man was a cheat.

01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:36.761
- If anything occurs to
you, call me, will you?

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:47.201
<i>'</i> DO YOU gamble?

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:50.403
- I was in love
with her, you know.

01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:57.970
The world breaks everyone.

01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:01.766
And afterwards, many are
strong at the broken places.

01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:05.043
But those that will
not break, it kills.

01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:07.891
It kills the very good
and the very gentle

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.367
and the very brave
impartially.

01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:12.124
If you are none of these,
you can be sure

01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:14.004
it will kill you, 1:00.

01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:16.964
But there will be
no special hurry.

01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:49.884
- Hey!

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.082
Jacko, how you doing?

01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:53.884
I heard what happened
to the casino.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.923
Pity they didn't
get away with it.

01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:58.042
I wish I'd been there.

01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:00.845
- You were there, mate.
- What?

01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:02.371
You know what happened
to me, don't you?

01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:03.891
That bitch Bella
shopped me--

01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:08.284
Bitch Bella shopped me
and you know what I had to do?

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:10.482
I had to beat
the shit out of her.

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:12.921
- You know what
I'd like Matt?

01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:14.883
I'd like to buy
you a drink.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.641
- Cheers! Congratulations.
- Happy New Year.

01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:21.849
I like you, Jacko.
You're so fucking straight.

01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:25.447
Here, You haven't
changed your clothes.

01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:32.242
The music stopped.

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:35.728
Jack was drunk.
Hallucinating.

01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:37.842
He was back.

01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:41.442
A child in the
wild coast casino.

01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:44.848
- You've been
avoiding me.

01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:48.407
- Have I?

01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:50.045
- I'm Lucy.

01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:56.243
- So, what do
you do, Lucy?

01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:59.045
- I'm a witch.

01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:02.801
A white witch.

01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:05.082
- Are you gonna put
a spell on me?

01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:10.487
- I might.

01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:13.325
That's mine.

01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:17.483
- Fuckin' hell.

01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:21.127
That's a nice car.

01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:23.961
How much did
you pay for it?

01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:25.923
- Too much. 1800.

01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:44.368
I saw her!

01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:48.970
You don't trust women
drivers, do you?

01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:51.811
Jack didn't trust anyone...

01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:54.048
Except himself.

01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:01.564
It was finally
finished.

01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:03.444
He thought of
sending it to Giles,

01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:05.642
But that wouldn't
be right.

01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:08.491
He would select a
publisher at random.

01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:10.682
Like a number.

01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:25.528
21,19,13.

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:26.880
- Here, please.
- 20.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.924
16, 20.

01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:32.202
Blackjack.

01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:38.370
- You're wasting
yourself.

01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:41.603
With your luck, you ought
to come over to our side.

01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:48.490
- Even his
publisher had no idea

01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:49.886
who the author was.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.321
He had done the deal
through a lawyer.

01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:56.331
It gave him a good
feeling, no one knowing.

01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:58.283
It never occurred to
anyone at the casino

01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:00.164
that the Golden Lion
had been his model.

01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:03.489
Why should it? Weren't
all casinos the same?

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:06.964
It gave him an
exquisite pleasure

01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:09.560
being an
underground man.

01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:13.088
With all his money, he hadn't
even bought a car.

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:16.090
Jack knew the truth
about himself.

01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:18.521
He was a
one-book writer.

01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:21.962
A one-time winner who had
quit while he was ahead.

01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:25.971
He changed nothing in the flat.

01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:29.163
Bought nothing,
spent nothing.

01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:30.810
The only thing he did was
to remove the bars

01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:32.001
outside the window.

01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:35.084
Nobody around. Leave
a message after the beep.

01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:42.929
- Hello?
- Jack, it's Jani.

01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:45.964
<i>- Jam. Where
are you'?</i>

01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:47.889
- Sun City.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.844
I've been meaning to
call you for months.

01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:53.167
- So how are you doing?
- Great.

01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:55.681
Listen, I'm
getting married.

01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:59.088
- At least, I think I am.
- Did you solve your problems?

01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:01.771
- Yeah, yeah. I'm all
over that now.

01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:04.167
Jack, hold on a minute,
there's someone here

01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:07.762
who wants
to talk to you.

01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:10.406
- Jacko.
- Dad.

01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:13.330
- I never thanked you
properly for your help.

01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:16.569
Jani tells me you behaved like
the perfect gentleman.

01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:20.480
I knew you would,
I know my son.

01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:23.410
The woman thinks
I'm gonna marry her.

01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:25.807
But you know me.

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:27.485
Well, it's a shame that
things never worked out,

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:30.604
but we saw you
all right.

01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:33.764
You didn't gamble the
ten grand, did you?

01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:37.487
- As a matter
of fact, I did.

01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:41.087
- But I won.
- That's my boy.

01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:43.089
How's that novel
of yours coming...

01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:45.441
So that was it.

01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:47.403
Final card.

01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:50.490
Blackjack.

01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:54.764
His father, 8,000 miles
and 27 years away

01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:56.928
was still dealing to
his son, Jack,

01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:01.568
from the bottom
of the deck.

01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:05.401
But Jake the Croupier
had a sense of humor.

01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:17.330
Here's to you.

01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:19.807
To both of you.

01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:28.125
- Who was that
on the phone?

01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:31.961
- Couple I know are
getting married.

01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:34.082
- Fools.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.480
Now he had reached the point

01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:56.491
where he no longer heard
the sound of the ball.

01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:59.968
The spin of the wheel
had brought him home

01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:03.562
to the place where
he was born.

01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:08.890
The Croupier's mission
was accomplished.

01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:14.525
He was master
of the game.

01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:18.725
He had acquired the power
to make you...

01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:22.765
lose.
