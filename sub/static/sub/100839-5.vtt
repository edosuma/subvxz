WEBVTT

00:15.348 --> 00:17.142
-I made you a heart.
-Gross.

00:17.726 --> 00:20.270
[sighs] Last trap is clear.

00:21.688 --> 00:22.647
You should be good.

00:23.023 --> 00:23.940
[Jen] Thank you, Slade.

00:24.107 --> 00:26.026
None of them gnawed
into your freezer, right?

00:26.109 --> 00:27.068
-No.
-Mnh-mnh.

00:27.152 --> 00:28.987
You're lucky. It's a solid machine.

00:31.406 --> 00:32.240
You want it?

00:32.824 --> 00:33.700
[Slade] Seriously?

00:34.826 --> 00:35.910
Dead serious.

00:36.119 --> 00:38.121
I could use it, I've got seven kids,
but... [sighs]

00:38.204 --> 00:40.206
I can't afford this Cadillac.

00:40.290 --> 00:41.499
-Please take it.
-It's yours.

00:42.375 --> 00:45.295
Oh, I feel so much lighter
with that freezer out of there.

00:45.378 --> 00:47.255
Ooh, flax crackers.

00:47.422 --> 00:49.632
I am so happy I never
have to see that thing again.

00:49.716 --> 00:50.550
Yeah, right?

00:50.633 --> 00:53.094
It's nice not to have
that constant reminder hanging over you.

00:54.512 --> 00:56.765
Yeah. [sighs]

00:57.015 --> 00:58.975
Okay, so, go on this ride with me.

00:59.100 --> 01:01.061
-Yeah.
-Paella tonight.

01:01.144 --> 01:03.772
It's a six-hour process,
but no risks, no reward, right?

01:04.105 --> 01:06.274
Do you know if we have saffron
at the house?

01:06.357 --> 01:07.609
Uh... [sighs]

01:07.734 --> 01:08.860
...no, you know, I don't.

01:08.943 --> 01:11.029
And I know that
your back has been hurting,

01:11.112 --> 01:14.074
so after dinner, pot gummies, hot tub...

01:14.199 --> 01:16.826
-Ooh, I'm listening.
-Then a documentary about Indian women

01:16.910 --> 01:19.204
who make their own maxi pads.
It's supposed to be really empowering.

01:19.871 --> 01:22.707
You know what else is empowering?
Four bottles for the price of three.

01:22.957 --> 01:24.417
See, that's so lucky.

01:24.501 --> 01:27.087
I'm telling you,
since I sent the petrified rock back,

01:27.337 --> 01:28.588
there's been an energetic shift.

01:29.089 --> 01:32.008
I hope so,
'cause mama needs a fucking break.

01:49.317 --> 01:51.319
[scanner beeping]

01:52.904 --> 01:55.907
There's also that documentary about
the Saudi Arabian women who get to drive.

01:56.407 --> 01:57.700
Is it "Sowdi" or "Sawdi"?

01:58.034 --> 01:59.661
Anyway, I don't know if they get to drive,

01:59.744 --> 02:02.163
or because they already know,
or if they learn to drive,

02:02.247 --> 02:03.706
but it's supposed to be really good.

02:03.790 --> 02:06.543
$263,42.

02:06.626 --> 02:09.087
There's also the one about misogyny
and revenge porn.

02:09.170 --> 02:11.464
Ooh, take a penny, leave a penny!
I love that.

02:11.798 --> 02:12.715
[beeps]

02:12.799 --> 02:15.802
-Oh, sorry, your card didn't go through.
-Oh, just run it again, please.

02:16.219 --> 02:18.513
Uh, I already did. Twice.

02:18.888 --> 02:21.391
Well, then something must be wrong
with your runner thingy.

02:21.474 --> 02:23.226
Or your card's maxed out.

02:23.309 --> 02:24.978
Maybe your card's maxed out.

02:25.311 --> 02:27.021
That doesn't even make sense.

02:27.105 --> 02:28.356
Just take some items out.

02:28.439 --> 02:30.233
Do you really need eight bottles of wine?

02:30.316 --> 02:33.903
Oh, I'm sorry, are you the wine sheriff?

02:33.987 --> 02:38.116
Because I am the dick police and you have
the right to remain fucking silent.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.493
What is your problem, lady?

02:40.577 --> 02:42.287
You're my fucking problem, Tyler!

02:42.370 --> 02:43.705
-Eww.
-[Jen mocks]

02:43.788 --> 02:44.664
[Jen and Judy gasp]

02:46.916 --> 02:47.876
I'm not paying for that.

02:48.459 --> 02:49.669
I'm not cleaning that up.

02:49.752 --> 02:51.004
-[mocks]
-I will.

02:52.255 --> 02:54.716
-No worries.
-Ah, shit.

02:57.760 --> 02:58.845
[sighs]

02:58.970 --> 03:01.306
-I didn't realize it was that bad.
-Yeah.

03:01.723 --> 03:04.142
-What can I do?
-You got 20 grand I can borrow?

03:04.225 --> 03:05.643
Not liquid, no.

03:05.727 --> 03:08.104
-If I can get my paintings back--
-Oh, Judy, it's...

03:08.646 --> 03:09.647
How else can I help?

03:10.356 --> 03:11.691
You know, there's, like, a...

03:11.774 --> 03:13.860
...like, a hovering that can stop...

03:14.360 --> 03:15.195
-Oh.
-...maybe.

03:15.278 --> 03:17.530
-Sorry. Nobody likes a hoverer.
-No, it's okay.

03:18.364 --> 03:20.491
-Is it your back? Do you need your brace?
-Oh, fucking stop!

03:20.742 --> 03:21.618
-Fine.
-I'm sorry.

03:21.701 --> 03:22.535
It's okay.

03:22.827 --> 03:23.870
[sighs]

03:24.120 --> 03:26.456
Look, Judy, you know that I love you.

03:26.539 --> 03:27.582
I love you too.

03:28.374 --> 03:31.252
And I know these last few weeks
have been intense,

03:31.336 --> 03:34.797
but we have hung out every day...

03:35.798 --> 03:38.885
for all the days, and, um, it's been--

03:38.968 --> 03:40.053
Really nice.

03:40.136 --> 03:42.347
Yeah, yeah, but...

03:42.430 --> 03:44.098
Look, I know you have a lot
of love to give.

03:44.182 --> 03:45.058
Thank you.

03:45.725 --> 03:47.644
Uh, but it's getting a little co-dependy,

03:48.102 --> 03:50.980
and, uh, I just,
I kind of need some space,

03:51.064 --> 03:52.440
you know, just, like,

03:53.149 --> 03:56.611
to kind of get my life back on track.

03:56.694 --> 03:58.738
Yeah, yeah. Totally.

03:58.821 --> 03:59.656
-Okay?
-Right.

04:00.531 --> 04:01.783
Yeah, s--

04:01.866 --> 04:02.700
Cool.

04:04.869 --> 04:06.996
-Did you want the time to start right now?
-I do.

04:08.289 --> 04:09.165
-Okay.
-Okay.

04:09.499 --> 04:10.917
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

04:11.376 --> 04:12.669
If you need anything, I'm just...

04:12.752 --> 04:14.379
Yeah, I know how close you are.

04:14.462 --> 04:16.339
-Yeah, I'm gonna...
-Okay.

04:16.422 --> 04:17.966
Busy doing some stuff, but...

04:18.049 --> 04:18.883
Okay, great.

04:20.885 --> 04:21.761
Thank you.

04:46.369 --> 04:49.122
-[man] Excuse me.
-Sorry. [laughs]

04:58.256 --> 04:59.465
-An Arby's?
-[Judy] Mm-hmm.

05:00.425 --> 05:03.011
-I mean, yum.
-Sure, it's great for the community,

05:03.094 --> 05:05.096
but the gallery is, like,
just totally gone.

05:05.972 --> 05:09.225
[stammers] I just really need
my paintings back, you know?

05:09.309 --> 05:11.102
Well, yeah, of course,
it's your life's work.

05:11.352 --> 05:12.854
I was hoping I could sell them.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.481
You don't happen to know where they are,
do you?

05:15.565 --> 05:17.692
No, I don't, sorry. I could ask Howard.

05:17.775 --> 05:21.195
No, don't ask Howard. I mean, he's, like,
super busy. He's got a lot on his plate.

05:21.279 --> 05:23.656
Speaking of plates,
thank you for sharing your lunch.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.992
This sandwich is really
filling the old void.

05:26.075 --> 05:27.035
[chuckles] Of course.

05:27.577 --> 05:30.621
You don't think that maybe they ended up
back at your parents' house, do you?

05:30.705 --> 05:32.248
No, no, sorry.

05:32.707 --> 05:33.541
But, Judy,

05:34.459 --> 05:37.295
I wanted to tell you something.
You were right.

05:37.378 --> 05:38.588
-I was?
-Mm-hmm.

05:39.422 --> 05:40.673
Steve did go to Mexico.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.759
-What?
-Mm-hmm. A month ago.

05:43.259 --> 05:45.678
They have a record of him
crossing the border in a white truck.

05:45.762 --> 05:46.888
Oh, my God.

05:47.764 --> 05:48.973
Did they know what he was doing there?

05:49.057 --> 05:51.768
I don't know, something about car parts.
Is this really homemade?

05:52.226 --> 05:53.895
'Cause this tastes store-bought,
in a good way.

05:53.978 --> 05:55.271
No, I make my own nut butter.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.814
Oh, she's so casual about it.

05:57.523 --> 06:00.068
Anyway, turns out the FBI

06:00.443 --> 06:01.861
is after a much bigger fish.

06:01.944 --> 06:04.739
Okay? So if we can find him
and get him to cooperate,

06:04.822 --> 06:07.325
they'll cut him a deal,
and he'll be okay.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.994
-Really?
-Yeah. That's something, right?

06:10.078 --> 06:12.372
-Yeah, that's really something.
-Okay, so,

06:12.747 --> 06:14.207
-Jude...
-Yeah.

06:14.290 --> 06:16.292
-If you know anything else...
-I don't.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.419
...what he was doing
a few days beforehand.

06:18.503 --> 06:19.921
-I don't.
-If you know where he is...

06:20.004 --> 06:21.672
-I don't.
-If you know, please tell me.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.383
-I wish I did. I would...
-We're desperate.

06:23.466 --> 06:24.717
-You can trust me.
-I do!

06:24.801 --> 06:27.637
All I know is that he was really stressed.
He bought a condo a few days ago,

06:27.720 --> 06:30.681
and then he pulled out of the deal,
which really fucked Jen over financially.

06:31.557 --> 06:32.809
Wait. Jen, your Jen?

06:33.393 --> 06:34.227
Who?

06:34.811 --> 06:36.312
Jen saw him a couple days ago?

06:36.854 --> 06:38.022
Um...

06:39.190 --> 06:42.026
I mean, did I say a few days ago?

06:42.527 --> 06:46.364
[laughs] I have such a loose grasp
on time. You know me.

06:46.447 --> 06:48.658
[mutters, laughs]

06:49.784 --> 06:50.660
Huh.

06:54.622 --> 06:56.249
[pants]

06:58.543 --> 07:00.169
You fucking idiot.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.755
Stupid fucking idiot.

07:02.839 --> 07:04.090
[sobs] What did you do?

07:05.967 --> 07:07.343
What did you do?

07:07.468 --> 07:10.096
Tsk. Why can't you just be quiet?

07:10.471 --> 07:11.305
[sniffles]

07:11.722 --> 07:14.934
Fucking be quiet, for once.
Why can't you be fucking quiet?

07:15.017 --> 07:17.562
Why can't you ever be quiet for a minute?!

07:18.146 --> 07:21.357
Why can't you ever just shut your mouth
and do what you're told?

07:29.657 --> 07:31.492
[gasps]

07:31.576 --> 07:33.119
[mutters]

07:34.203 --> 07:36.873
-Oh, shit, sorry--
-No, sorry, I just, um...

07:36.956 --> 07:39.000
It's not your fault.
I should have locked the door.

07:39.083 --> 07:40.585
-Are you sure?
-No, yeah, come on in.

07:40.668 --> 07:42.253
I'll wash my hands and be gone.

07:44.005 --> 07:47.300
-[sighing]
-Are you okay?

07:47.800 --> 07:49.469
Yeah, I'm just... You know.

07:50.511 --> 07:51.929
[laughs] I'm having a day.

07:52.263 --> 07:53.764
Ugh, me too.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.225
-Fuck this day.
-Yeah, right?

07:56.642 --> 07:59.312
-[sighs]
-Mercury's in retrograde or something.

07:59.395 --> 08:01.522
-Huh. It's always in retrograde, isn't it?
-Right?

08:01.606 --> 08:03.191
-[laughs]
-Are you okay?

08:03.858 --> 08:05.818
-Eh.
-Do you want to talk about it?

08:05.902 --> 08:09.906
-God, no. Do you?
-Ugh. My God, no. [laughs]

08:10.448 --> 08:12.366
Do you want to maybe drink about it?

08:14.410 --> 08:15.912
I really shouldn't, so--

08:15.995 --> 08:17.747
Well, there's a lot of things
we shouldn't do.

08:21.584 --> 08:22.418
Yes.

08:23.085 --> 08:25.463
I would very much like to drink about it.

08:25.546 --> 08:27.048
[both laugh]

08:31.969 --> 08:33.221
[exhales]

08:34.722 --> 08:36.807
Oh, hey, Lorna. Lorna. Lorna!

08:37.225 --> 08:39.727
-Can I talk to you for a minute?
-Well, make it snappy, Jennifer.

08:39.810 --> 08:42.897
I have a promising lunch date
with a one-term state senator.

08:43.022 --> 08:46.651
He saw my <i>Over Asking</i> cover story
and vigorously pursued me.

08:46.734 --> 08:48.236
Why are you walking like a cripple?

08:48.319 --> 08:52.281
Oh, I was playing basketball with Charlie,
and I pulled my back out, so back brace.

08:53.407 --> 08:55.660
What on Earth were you thinking?
You're over 50.

08:56.035 --> 08:59.330
-Uh, no, actually, I'm not.
-Are you sure?

08:59.413 --> 09:00.790
Okay, can I just talk now?

09:01.707 --> 09:03.668
How much do you think I could get
for my house?

09:04.085 --> 09:05.169
You mean <i>our</i> house?

09:05.711 --> 09:08.256
No, I mean, you helped with the deposit,
but it's not your--

09:08.339 --> 09:10.174
I gave you the entire down payment.

09:10.258 --> 09:11.676
My name's on the deed.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.095
-It is?
-Ted insisted.

09:15.346 --> 09:16.180
He did?

09:16.597 --> 09:19.767
Okay, um, anyway,
things are just a little tight right now,

09:19.850 --> 09:23.854
and I have fallen behind on our mortgage.

09:24.605 --> 09:27.900
And I just think it's time
for the boys and I to downsize.

09:27.984 --> 09:28.818
No.

09:29.318 --> 09:30.695
What do you mean "no"?

09:30.778 --> 09:33.698
I won't let you sell the only home
those boys have ever known.

09:34.073 --> 09:36.993
A home filled with memories
of their father.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.162
Your problem isn't your mortgage,
Jennifer.

09:40.788 --> 09:42.540
Your problem is you.

09:43.749 --> 09:44.834
Excuse me?

09:44.917 --> 09:46.711
Your personality's off-putting.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.713
It's affecting your sales.

09:48.796 --> 09:50.172
Well, you know, it's not my fault

09:50.256 --> 09:53.384
that the pregnant couple didn't want
to live in a house with black mold.

09:54.844 --> 09:57.722
The pregnant people closed
on the mold house this morning,

09:57.805 --> 09:58.931
once I stepped in.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.391
Once you stepped in?

10:00.474 --> 10:02.476
They just needed a loving little nudge.

10:03.477 --> 10:05.271
But that's never been your strong suit.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.231
Always bothered Ted.

10:08.816 --> 10:09.775
Just remember,

10:10.276 --> 10:13.821
the only harder sell than a moldy house
is a bitter woman.

10:14.363 --> 10:15.865
No one wants to live with that.

10:27.793 --> 10:30.880
-[honking]
-[laughs]

10:32.882 --> 10:33.716
[sighs]

10:39.388 --> 10:40.640
What the fuck is this?

10:50.775 --> 10:52.443
[laughs] What the fuck?

10:56.739 --> 10:57.782
[zips]

11:10.378 --> 11:11.545
Fuck off.

11:12.088 --> 11:13.881
[laughs] Charlie!

11:14.173 --> 11:17.510
This car is such a flex.
Where did you get it?

11:17.593 --> 11:20.554
My mom had it stashed away.
I think it's for my birthday.

11:21.514 --> 11:24.475
It's, like, straight fire. [chuckles]

11:24.934 --> 11:26.477
Should we see how fast it can go?

11:26.894 --> 11:27.728
Fuck, yeah.

11:28.437 --> 11:30.439
[engine revs]

11:30.981 --> 11:32.108
[tires screech]

11:35.277 --> 11:36.821
[laughing]

11:36.904 --> 11:38.823
[shouts] Ah! My hair! My hair!

11:45.830 --> 11:48.708
[Jen] No, no. No. The cameras work.

11:49.208 --> 11:50.668
Uh, just...

11:51.419 --> 11:52.837
you know, too well. Haha.

11:52.920 --> 11:56.340
So I was just realizing
that I don't want the full coverage.

11:56.424 --> 12:00.428
So if there's any way that I could
possibly scale back that--

12:01.178 --> 12:02.054
Mm-hmm.

12:03.013 --> 12:05.141
Gotcha. Yep, yep, yep.

12:05.433 --> 12:09.186
No, I know, I signed the contract,
so there's that.

12:10.604 --> 12:11.647
Um...

12:13.107 --> 12:16.485
While I have you on the phone,
do you think you could walk me through...

12:17.361 --> 12:19.947
um, erasing some footage that I have?

12:20.656 --> 12:21.490
Okay.

12:22.032 --> 12:22.867
Yeah, I just...

12:23.534 --> 12:25.703
Mm-hmm. Okay.

12:27.246 --> 12:28.080
Hiya.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.751
-Hi.
-Sorry, I didn't mean to barge.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.753
Janice said to just come on in.

12:34.253 --> 12:37.173
Oh, well, if Janice says it,
then I guess it's fine.

12:37.256 --> 12:40.801
[belt unfastens]

12:40.885 --> 12:41.969
[Jen groans]

12:44.138 --> 12:45.055
Um...

12:47.183 --> 12:48.017
How can I, um...

12:49.518 --> 12:50.770
What are you doing here?

12:50.895 --> 12:52.271
Oh, right, um...

12:52.688 --> 12:55.065
Don't want to take up too much
of your time, but, uh...

12:55.149 --> 12:58.194
I just had lunch with Judy, and, uh,
she said you were working with Steve.

12:59.695 --> 13:01.822
She did? She said that?

13:01.906 --> 13:03.783
She said he backed out of a deal
or something

13:03.866 --> 13:05.075
right before he disappeared,

13:05.159 --> 13:06.994
uh, said he screwed you over pretty badly.

13:07.536 --> 13:08.913
I wouldn't say screwed, no.

13:08.996 --> 13:10.498
She said "fucked," actually. [laughs]

13:10.581 --> 13:11.832
Oh.

13:11.999 --> 13:15.127
Yeah, but, uh, you know what?
Deals fall through all the time.

13:15.669 --> 13:16.754
No hard feelings.

13:16.837 --> 13:19.089
Right, right.
Well, did he give you a reason why,

13:19.173 --> 13:21.383
or was he acting weird at all?

13:21.467 --> 13:24.595
You know what? I don't really know him,
so I don't know his baseline.

13:24.678 --> 13:26.180
You may be one of the last people
to see him--

13:26.263 --> 13:27.389
Well, I wasn't.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.059
I mean, I'm sure I wasn't,

13:30.142 --> 13:34.563
because he has a lot of associates
and-- and, uh, the people.

13:35.105 --> 13:35.940
Of course.

13:36.023 --> 13:37.191
-Sorry I can't help you.
-Yeah.

13:40.277 --> 13:42.655
Just one more question. Uh...

13:43.447 --> 13:44.406
Mm-hmm.

13:46.784 --> 13:49.703
Hmm. Do you ever do short-term rentals?
[laughs]

13:50.412 --> 13:51.247
I'm sorry, what?

13:51.330 --> 13:53.374
I just don't know how long
this is gonna go on for,

13:53.457 --> 13:55.960
and I'm living with my mom,
and I love her to death,

13:56.043 --> 13:59.755
but it's kind of like I can't take it
anymore, if that makes sense? [laughs]

13:59.839 --> 14:00.756
Mm-hmm, it does.

14:00.840 --> 14:04.593
Let me just look
for some short-term listings for you.

14:06.470 --> 14:08.430
[groans]

14:08.514 --> 14:10.140
Uh, L4-L5?

14:10.558 --> 14:11.642
-What?
-Your back.

14:11.725 --> 14:14.687
Oh, uh, L5-S1. It was close.

14:15.479 --> 14:18.315
[grunting] How long were you,
um, wanting to...

14:19.108 --> 14:20.776
-to get a place?
-Hard to tell.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.362
I don't know.
We were hoping to find him by now.

14:23.445 --> 14:24.989
People don't just vanish, you know?

14:25.906 --> 14:26.740
Yeah.

14:27.157 --> 14:28.576
-[groans]
-Are you okay?

14:28.659 --> 14:30.035
Mm-hmm. I'm fine.

14:30.119 --> 14:32.079
I wouldn't lean over any more.
You're gonna seize.

14:32.162 --> 14:33.581
-[groaning]
-Okay.

14:36.584 --> 14:38.252
[Jen sighs] I'm good.

14:38.335 --> 14:40.462
[Ben] Uh, are you sure?

14:41.171 --> 14:43.132
Uh, yep.

14:44.592 --> 14:48.345
Rentals, though you might want
to look at the long-terms, too. [groans]

14:48.429 --> 14:49.597
-Are you...
-I'm good.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.432
-Can I...
-No, I'm fine.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.268
[Jen] Thank you for driving me home.

14:54.351 --> 14:55.686
-You didn't have to--
-[Ben] No sweat.

14:55.769 --> 14:58.022
Okay, no pressure,
I could do a quick adjustment--

14:58.105 --> 14:58.939
-Oh, God, no.
-No?

14:59.023 --> 14:59.857
-No.
-Okay.

14:59.940 --> 15:01.317
No, I'm perfectly fine.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.776
-This is-- yeah, I don't--
-Right.

15:02.860 --> 15:05.195
I just need to get to the chair.

15:05.279 --> 15:06.447
-Easy, easy.
-I'm good.

15:06.530 --> 15:09.909
Really, I am. I am-- [groaning]

15:13.829 --> 15:16.540
[moans] Yep.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.042
-Yep.
-I'm good. [sighs]

15:18.125 --> 15:21.962
Okay. Well, that didn't inspire
a boatload of confidence, but--

15:22.046 --> 15:24.298
-[doorbell rings]
-Aww, shit.

15:24.798 --> 15:27.509
-I'll get that.
-Oh. Okay, thank you.

15:30.679 --> 15:31.805
-Hi.
-Uh, hello.

15:32.306 --> 15:34.642
-Uh, do I know you?
-You do now.

15:35.059 --> 15:37.728
-I'm Ben.
-Hi. Um, that's my friend. [laughs]

15:39.647 --> 15:41.482
-Hi, Jen.
-Hi, Karen.

15:41.565 --> 15:44.318
Sorry, didn't realize you had company.

15:44.401 --> 15:45.945
Oh, yeah, it's not--

15:46.028 --> 15:49.239
I just cracked open some
orange huh-huh! Are you interested?

15:49.323 --> 15:51.241
You know what, Karen,
please don't open it. Listen.

15:51.325 --> 15:52.159
-It's tight.
-Yeah.

15:52.242 --> 15:56.288
I actually pulled my back out,
so maybe later.

15:57.206 --> 15:59.500
After my chiropractor leaves.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.502
-[Karen gasps] Oh!
-Okay?

16:01.585 --> 16:03.045
Pulled your back out.

16:03.504 --> 16:04.546
I get it.

16:05.172 --> 16:07.758
Uh, you were here the other night, right?

16:08.258 --> 16:09.093
Sorry, what?

16:09.176 --> 16:10.302
-No.
-[Karen] Yes.

16:10.427 --> 16:12.096
I saw you on my street cam. [laughs]

16:12.179 --> 16:15.265
Remember, the next day you said
you were with a full-grown man?

16:15.349 --> 16:16.308
I got it right here.

16:16.392 --> 16:17.601
-Karen, shut up.
-It's really--

16:17.726 --> 16:18.560
Shut up.

16:21.271 --> 16:23.148
It's not him.
You don't know what you're saying.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.066
You're drunk.

16:27.528 --> 16:29.530
[stuttering] I'm gonna go get some ice.

16:29.613 --> 16:30.447
Okay.

16:34.410 --> 16:37.079
I'm sorry. Oh, God.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.707
I hope I didn't ruin anything.

16:39.790 --> 16:40.916
-Oh, no.
-Oh, no.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.378
Just... Jeff's out of town again,
you know, and I just...

16:44.878 --> 16:46.046
[sobs] I get lonely.

16:46.130 --> 16:49.925
I know. Listen, you're okay.
Can you just go home, please?

16:50.050 --> 16:50.926
Okay.

16:51.969 --> 16:52.928
I love you.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.097
I love, love, love, love.

16:55.597 --> 16:57.725
I'm just gonna keep that.
You shouldn't have that.

16:58.517 --> 16:59.768
All right. [sighs]

16:59.852 --> 17:01.937
-Sorry.
-[exhales] Oh, my God.

17:02.438 --> 17:03.313
Fuck.

17:04.773 --> 17:05.649
[exhales]

17:05.774 --> 17:08.068
-Hey.
-[Jen] Hey. I'm sorry about all that.

17:08.152 --> 17:11.739
She's just kind of going through
a rough patch.

17:12.406 --> 17:15.367
Husband's cheating on her with a dude.

17:15.451 --> 17:18.871
Oh. Well, that's gotta make you
take a good, long look.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.164
What was she talking about?

17:20.539 --> 17:22.124
-Huh?
-She said something about the guy

17:22.207 --> 17:24.209
she thought was me,
that was here the other night?

17:25.044 --> 17:26.086
And was it Steve?

17:27.921 --> 17:28.756
No.

17:29.089 --> 17:29.965
No?

17:31.633 --> 17:32.593
Sorry, I just...

17:33.177 --> 17:35.137
I assumed that it was
a guy who looked like me,

17:35.220 --> 17:38.474
-and you were working with him--
-Oh, that's-- no, no, no, no.

17:38.557 --> 17:42.311
That was a completely other man...
Timothy.

17:42.561 --> 17:45.105
Gotcha. Oh, yeah, no, I'm-- yeah.

17:45.939 --> 17:46.774
Sorry about that.

17:46.857 --> 17:49.610
Yeah, and of course you could have had
a million other guys over.

17:49.693 --> 17:51.695
-What?
-Not that you would've...

17:52.613 --> 17:54.782
[laughs] ...had a million guys over.

17:54.865 --> 17:56.992
[stammers] And maybe you did or...

17:57.951 --> 17:59.787
Yeah, I'm gonna mind my own business,

17:59.870 --> 18:03.165
and I'm going to
just be your "chiropractor."

18:03.957 --> 18:05.876
Um, you should ice it.

18:06.543 --> 18:07.377
Doctor's orders.

18:07.878 --> 18:09.296
-[Jen] Thank you.
-[grunts]

18:09.379 --> 18:11.381
-Are you sure you're--
-Yep.

18:11.799 --> 18:14.009
[groans]

18:14.134 --> 18:15.511
And it's back there.

18:16.136 --> 18:17.304
[trills] I'm good.

18:19.556 --> 18:21.558
[pop music playing]

18:29.358 --> 18:30.484
[both laugh]

18:33.403 --> 18:34.321
[knock on window]

18:35.364 --> 18:36.198
[Charlie] Fuck.

18:39.409 --> 18:41.245
Hey. You can't be parked here.

18:43.580 --> 18:44.414
This your car?

18:44.790 --> 18:46.166
Yeah, yeah, it's my car.

18:51.922 --> 18:53.507
Well, take it somewhere else.

18:53.590 --> 18:54.842
This is private property.

18:58.011 --> 19:00.264
[laughing] Oh, my God.

19:01.390 --> 19:02.766
We gotta get out of here.

19:03.642 --> 19:06.061
-Oh, this place.
-Yeah.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.397
[Judy] Oh! Oh, my God!

19:09.064 --> 19:11.608
-Oh, I love this view.
-I know, right?

19:11.692 --> 19:12.776
-[Judy] Thank you.
-Uh-huh.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.863
[gasps] It's gorgeous.
I've always wanted to come here.

19:16.196 --> 19:17.281
Well, that works out.

19:17.739 --> 19:20.951
-Are you hungry?
-Yes, but it doesn't look open.

19:23.453 --> 19:24.830
Michelle, where are you going?

19:27.166 --> 19:28.125
What are you doing?

19:28.792 --> 19:30.586
-[man] Hey, Chef.
-Hey, Enrique.

19:31.295 --> 19:32.129
"Chef"?

19:32.504 --> 19:35.048
Yeah. They're letting women be chefs now.

19:35.132 --> 19:38.135
-What the fuck are they thinking?
-[laughing]

19:38.218 --> 19:39.636
I love to cook, too.

19:39.720 --> 19:40.554
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

19:41.513 --> 19:42.389
[Michelle] All right.

19:43.682 --> 19:45.184
Get back here and show me what you got.

19:45.642 --> 19:46.977
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

19:47.060 --> 19:48.729
[Judy gasps] What?

19:50.522 --> 19:51.356
Oh.

19:51.440 --> 19:54.902
You should have seen your face
when you thought I was breaking in.

19:54.985 --> 19:57.529
-[laughs]
-I didn't know you were such a good girl.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.156
Oh, I'm not.

19:59.990 --> 20:01.033
I don't know.

20:01.116 --> 20:03.660
Got those cute bangs
and that sweet little dress.

20:03.744 --> 20:06.830
-It's really just a cover.
-[laughs]

20:06.955 --> 20:08.749
All right, what do you want?

20:09.541 --> 20:12.419
Um, what's your specialty?

20:12.502 --> 20:13.503
Making you happy.

20:13.587 --> 20:16.465
-[gasps] I like that specialty.
-Mm-hmm.

20:16.548 --> 20:19.051
Well, I don't know, surprise me.

20:19.885 --> 20:22.054
[Jen] I'm only letting you do this
because I'm desperate.

20:22.429 --> 20:24.973
-Oh, if I had a nickel--
-Please don't make me change my mind.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.309
Okay. Um, may I?

20:28.018 --> 20:28.852
Yep.

20:29.519 --> 20:32.773
All right.
I'm really gonna need you to relax here.

20:32.856 --> 20:34.566
-I'm trying. I'm trying.
-Oh, yeah.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.027
-Wiggle your toes.
-Huh?

20:37.486 --> 20:38.862
Just wiggle your toes.

20:38.987 --> 20:40.030
Okay.

20:41.114 --> 20:43.325
-[bones crack]
-He was fucking miserable, wasn't he?

20:47.079 --> 20:47.913
[Ben] Well...

20:49.414 --> 20:50.832
that loosened something up.

20:53.001 --> 20:54.711
-Yeah.
-Now, hang tight.

20:57.965 --> 20:59.591
Okay. Um...

21:00.926 --> 21:02.219
Cross your arms for me.

21:04.805 --> 21:06.807
I'm just gonna come in here gently

21:07.140 --> 21:09.142
and lift you up just a little bit here.

21:10.602 --> 21:11.603
All right.

21:12.187 --> 21:14.147
Uh, big inhale.

21:14.606 --> 21:17.025
[both inhale]

21:17.109 --> 21:19.486
-[Ben] And let it out.
-[bones crack]

21:19.569 --> 21:21.446
You are one mean fucking bitch.

21:21.530 --> 21:22.823
[exhales]

21:24.950 --> 21:27.494
[crying]

21:29.329 --> 21:32.291
-[sniffles] I'm sorry.
-No, no, no. That's okay.

21:32.916 --> 21:34.376
No need to apologize.

21:34.918 --> 21:36.837
You know, we hold a lot of stuff
in our bodies.

21:36.920 --> 21:39.673
-[gasps]
-Trauma, stress...

21:40.757 --> 21:41.842
anger.

21:42.217 --> 21:43.677
It's healthy to let it out.

21:44.636 --> 21:46.638
[crying]

21:53.687 --> 21:55.439
[laughing]

21:56.356 --> 21:57.649
February 21st.

21:58.400 --> 22:01.028
-Of course you're a Pisces.
-Right?

22:01.111 --> 22:03.697
You're artsy, and you're loving.

22:03.780 --> 22:06.158
Ooh, maybe a little too loving.

22:06.241 --> 22:07.909
Why do you say that like it's a bad thing?

22:08.368 --> 22:10.746
My friend Jen thinks I'm a little clingy.

22:11.121 --> 22:12.247
Is she a Scorpio?

22:13.415 --> 22:14.916
-Yes.
-[Michelle] Hmm.

22:15.375 --> 22:16.460
Are you a little bit psychic?

22:16.543 --> 22:19.463
Hmm. I'm a Taurus. We know shit. Okay.

22:20.464 --> 22:23.383
I'm gonna need you to try this polenta
before it gets cold.

22:32.809 --> 22:33.769
[Judy] Oh, my God.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.772
That is the best polenta I've ever had.

22:37.230 --> 22:38.690
Mine is never that creamy.

22:38.774 --> 22:40.025
Eh, it's just butter.

22:40.108 --> 22:43.070
I mean, there, I just summed up
culinary school for you in three words.

22:43.153 --> 22:45.739
-Well, good. Now I don't have to go.
-[laughs]

22:45.822 --> 22:48.158
So, uh, how did you learn to cook?

22:49.493 --> 22:50.410
Hmm.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.537
I taught myself as a kid.

22:53.622 --> 22:55.123
Oh, right. [exhales]

22:55.207 --> 22:56.792
Was your mom not around much?

22:57.417 --> 23:00.962
No. No, she kind of
disappeared a lot, so...

23:01.546 --> 23:03.382
So you had to take care of yourself?

23:03.465 --> 23:04.341
Yeah.

23:04.841 --> 23:05.675
And her.

23:05.759 --> 23:08.470
I mean, when she finally would come home,
she'd be so out of it that, uh,

23:08.553 --> 23:10.639
if I didn't cook stuff,
she wouldn't eat, so...

23:11.598 --> 23:13.016
That's a lot for a kid.

23:14.309 --> 23:15.227
Yeah. Thanks.

23:15.435 --> 23:18.980
Um, did you want to talk about that thing
you didn't want to talk about earlier?

23:19.398 --> 23:21.733
It's not really that big of a deal.
I don't know.

23:22.317 --> 23:26.530
My mom keeps calling my ex-girlfriend

23:26.613 --> 23:28.073
to complain about me.

23:28.907 --> 23:31.159
So that's a cool thing I got going on.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.578
What's to complain about?
You're so good to her.

23:33.662 --> 23:35.789
Or I'm a selfish dick.
Depends who you ask.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.750
I think it's kind of nice they talk.

23:38.834 --> 23:40.252
My ex's mom hated me.

23:40.794 --> 23:42.546
How long ago did you guys break up?

23:44.423 --> 23:46.591
Oh, a while ago.

23:48.218 --> 23:50.512
Is your ex still in the picture?

23:53.473 --> 23:55.517
[Jen] <i>No one can ever know what happened.</i>

23:56.893 --> 23:57.727
No.

23:59.229 --> 24:00.480
No, it's definitely over.

24:02.691 --> 24:03.525
Got it.

24:04.025 --> 24:05.694
So did it not end well?

24:06.111 --> 24:06.945
No.

24:07.696 --> 24:08.572
But...

24:09.906 --> 24:11.283
I'm just trying to move on.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.118
I hear that.

24:13.535 --> 24:14.369
Hey.

24:15.412 --> 24:18.498
Do you think that crystals are
bullshit nonsense,

24:18.582 --> 24:21.710
or do you think that
they are magical compounds

24:21.793 --> 24:23.295
formed by spiritual energy?

24:23.795 --> 24:26.965
I <i>know </i>they're magical compounds
formed by spiritual energy.

24:27.632 --> 24:28.467
Okay.

24:29.593 --> 24:30.552
[clears throat]

24:35.140 --> 24:36.850
I want you to have this.

24:36.933 --> 24:37.893
It's my favorite.

24:39.394 --> 24:41.354
-Is this a moonstone?
-Uh-huh.

24:41.438 --> 24:42.731
[gasps]

24:42.814 --> 24:46.860
-Are you really giving this to me?
-Yeah. It symbolizes new beginnings.

24:52.824 --> 24:53.742
To new beginnings.

24:53.825 --> 24:54.743
To new beginnings.

24:54.868 --> 24:55.702
[clinks]

24:57.621 --> 25:01.750
I'm sorry. I'm not usually the biggest fan
of crying in front of strangers.

25:01.833 --> 25:04.711
Oh, hey. You're not the first lady
I've made cry.

25:05.629 --> 25:07.297
-Hmm.
-Sorry. [scoffs]

25:07.380 --> 25:08.632
You do that a lot, don't you?

25:09.257 --> 25:11.134
Uh, make bad jokes?

25:11.218 --> 25:14.554
Well, they're not terrible,
they're just not funny.

25:14.638 --> 25:17.140
[chuckles] Um, thanks for the feedback.

25:17.349 --> 25:18.517
Yeah, sometimes I feel like

25:18.600 --> 25:22.312
Steve got all the confidence in the womb,
and I got the heart defect.

25:23.688 --> 25:25.440
You seem to have a pretty good heart.

25:26.107 --> 25:27.609
Seven surgeries later, yeah.

25:28.109 --> 25:30.195
-It's okay. Something I deal with.
-Hmm.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.280
How about you?
Your back pain, is that a chronic thing?

25:32.364 --> 25:34.449
Yeah, I was a dancer...

25:34.866 --> 25:36.117
-Really?
-...for a long time.

25:36.201 --> 25:37.786
-Me, too.
-Shut up.

25:37.869 --> 25:39.663
Yeah, Miss Hedley's Dance Academy.

25:39.746 --> 25:41.039
First through fifth grade.

25:41.665 --> 25:44.167
Okay. Okay, this I have to see.

25:44.251 --> 25:45.085
What?

25:45.502 --> 25:46.586
You need to show me.

25:46.670 --> 25:49.589
-[laughs] You're gonna make me?
-Yep.

25:50.215 --> 25:52.759
[groans]

25:52.842 --> 25:55.554
[laughs] This is going to be...

25:56.596 --> 25:58.640
-probably pretty good.
-Mm-hmm.

25:59.641 --> 26:01.142
-Ooh.
-I don't even know what I'm doing here.

26:01.226 --> 26:02.936
I don't know what you're doing either.

26:04.354 --> 26:07.774
[laughs]
I'm not really sure what's happening here.

26:07.857 --> 26:08.733
[hums]

26:08.817 --> 26:10.986
-Some of that. [snaps fingers]
-[laughs] That's just...

26:12.320 --> 26:13.321
No, that didn't work.

26:13.405 --> 26:16.116
-Little worm.
-[laughing]

26:16.199 --> 26:17.826
Eww.

26:18.618 --> 26:22.205
-Wait for it.
-[laughing]

26:22.289 --> 26:24.332
Word. You're welcome.

26:24.416 --> 26:25.875
That's so wrong.

26:25.959 --> 26:27.043
How about a little <i>Magic Mike?</i>

26:27.127 --> 26:28.670
Okay, now that's where we draw the line.

26:28.753 --> 26:32.340
-That's just so stupid.
-[both laughing]

26:33.550 --> 26:35.010
Oh, God. Wow.

26:35.719 --> 26:37.887
-Man, my heart. [panting]
-Oh.

26:38.013 --> 26:40.432
Boy, how bad would you feel
if I died right now? [laughs]

26:41.349 --> 26:42.267
Sorry, that was...

26:42.350 --> 26:43.560
[groans] ...another one.

26:43.643 --> 26:45.937
[sighs] Boy, I just keep them coming,
don't I? Sorry.

26:46.396 --> 26:48.189
[laughs]

26:49.316 --> 26:51.359
What's this? "Say go to stop signs."

26:51.735 --> 26:55.697
Yeah, I probably could have
workshopped that a little bit more.

26:55.780 --> 26:57.699
Eh. Yeah, yeah, maybe.

26:57.782 --> 26:59.576
Hmm. Thanks for the feedback.

26:59.659 --> 27:02.912
Uh, no, my son is starting to drive.

27:02.996 --> 27:06.374
So now I have become that mother
that I hate.

27:06.458 --> 27:07.292
What's that?

27:08.001 --> 27:09.669
A mother who cares about her kid?

27:09.753 --> 27:10.754
Nothing wrong with that.

27:12.255 --> 27:13.882
My poor mom, she...

27:15.216 --> 27:18.511
She's really going through it right now.
[exhales]

27:18.595 --> 27:19.804
She's afraid to leave the house

27:19.888 --> 27:21.973
'cause she thinks Steve'll walk in
and she won't be there.

27:23.016 --> 27:24.267
Yeah, that's tough.

27:24.517 --> 27:25.352
Yeah.

27:26.061 --> 27:26.895
For all of us.

27:27.479 --> 27:28.313
[sighs]

27:29.731 --> 27:31.232
I haven't talked to him in over a year.

27:31.691 --> 27:32.984
-Really?
-Mnh-mnh.

27:35.070 --> 27:36.780
-What did he do?
-No.

27:39.157 --> 27:40.075
I was drinking,

27:40.492 --> 27:44.496
and we got into an argument
over something really stupid.

27:46.164 --> 27:47.666
And... [sighs]

27:47.749 --> 27:50.585
I just started going off on him.

27:51.836 --> 27:55.340
Everything I ever resented
about him just came, like,

27:56.049 --> 27:59.010
exploding out of me.
I just couldn't keep it down, you know?

28:01.680 --> 28:05.100
Of course, I regret it now.

28:06.810 --> 28:07.811
Yeah, I'm sure.

28:08.520 --> 28:12.565
I've been putting off making amends
with him, and now it's like...

28:13.692 --> 28:16.611
[sighs] ...you know,
what if I don't get to?

28:22.867 --> 28:24.285
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

28:25.537 --> 28:27.580
-put all this on you.
-No, it's okay.

28:28.832 --> 28:30.875
[cell phone ringing]

28:30.959 --> 28:33.378
Oh, I'm sorry. It's my son. I have to...

28:33.461 --> 28:34.295
It's okay.

28:34.587 --> 28:36.256
Hey. Hey, buddy.

28:38.550 --> 28:39.384
What?

28:39.467 --> 28:41.094
I told him to rip it out.

28:41.177 --> 28:43.012
I mean, who the hell wants
a black toilet bowl?

28:43.096 --> 28:44.973
No one. How am I gonna tell
if I'm hydrated?

28:45.056 --> 28:46.391
Yeah! Exactly.

28:46.474 --> 28:49.686
-You want to see your work.
-[cell phone ringing]

28:49.769 --> 28:50.937
You gotta take that?

28:51.479 --> 28:53.106
No, it's just my friend Jen.

28:53.857 --> 28:55.608
[rings]

28:55.692 --> 28:56.526
Wow.

28:57.026 --> 28:58.528
-Who's the clingy one now?
-Right?

28:58.611 --> 28:59.696
[Michelle] Mm-hmm.

29:00.905 --> 29:02.115
But maybe I should just...

29:04.242 --> 29:05.744
[clears throat] Hello?

29:09.831 --> 29:11.458
Oh, my God, what?

29:24.929 --> 29:26.431
What the hell, Charlie?

29:26.514 --> 29:28.933
I didn't think it would run out of gas.
I just took it for a spin.

29:29.017 --> 29:31.102
Run out of gas?
What the fuck are you even talking about?

29:31.186 --> 29:32.562
This was not yours to take!

29:32.645 --> 29:35.106
[Parker chuckles]
I thought it was a birthday present.

29:35.190 --> 29:36.733
Hey, I'm Parker.

29:39.527 --> 29:40.779
Get in the fucking car, Parker.

29:40.862 --> 29:42.238
Both of you, in Judy's car, now!

29:43.406 --> 29:44.365
What about my car?

29:44.449 --> 29:46.868
Your car? Oh, no, no, no.
You are never seeing this thing again.

29:47.368 --> 29:48.870
Get in her car.

29:50.163 --> 29:51.289
[Charlie] Oh, fine.

29:52.665 --> 29:53.750
-Holy shit.
-[Jen] I know.

29:53.833 --> 29:55.335
-Holy shit, what are we gonna do?
-I don't know.

29:55.418 --> 29:57.420
Just help me
and get them out of here, okay?

29:57.504 --> 29:59.923
-I'll figure it out.
-[stammers] Okay.

30:00.006 --> 30:02.008
[Jen panting]

30:06.638 --> 30:08.640
[engine turns over]

30:21.152 --> 30:22.195
He was miserable, wasn't he?

30:22.779 --> 30:23.988
Fucking go!

30:24.072 --> 30:25.740
You are one mean fucking bitch.

30:25.824 --> 30:28.368
I never want to see
your fucking face again!

30:28.493 --> 30:32.121
[echoes]
He was looking for a way out, honey.

31:28.928 --> 31:30.930
[theme music playing]

33:08.444 --> 33:09.946
[meows]
