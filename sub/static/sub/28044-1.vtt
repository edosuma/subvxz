01:09.021 --> 01:09.854
Hi.

01:11.998 --> 01:13.022
How are you?

01:13.023 --> 01:15.856
Go guys, win some money.

01:34.490 --> 01:36.059
Nice hit.

01:36.060 --> 01:38.779
It's the come-out roll, you
want the hard ways working?

01:38.780 --> 01:41.689
Yes, always working.
Hard ways working.

01:41.690 --> 01:44.450
Hard ways working, come-out
roll, place your bets.

01:47.100 --> 01:48.730
11, winner, pay the line.

01:49.580 --> 01:53.519
Yo Kora, you and Josh
going to Raine's tomorrow?

01:53.520 --> 01:55.149
Yeah, once you and Lexie was coming,

01:55.150 --> 01:56.699
there was no getting out of it.

01:56.700 --> 01:59.450
What's going on tomorrow?
Oh, just a pool party.

02:00.370 --> 02:02.389
With all you girls?

02:02.390 --> 02:04.819
And a few of our equally hot friends.

02:04.820 --> 02:07.259
Is this one of those
skinny dipping pool parties?

02:07.260 --> 02:09.469
Well yeah, duh.

02:09.470 --> 02:11.699
The thing is since we're all so young,

02:11.700 --> 02:14.259
hot and bisexual, it
usually degrades into

02:14.260 --> 02:17.189
a freaky lesbian orgy into
the wee hours of the morning

02:17.190 --> 02:19.809
and if we get in the mood for some dick,

02:19.810 --> 02:22.480
we order pizza and have
the delivery guy join in.

02:23.510 --> 02:27.350
You know, it's amazing how
accurate porn movies really are.

02:28.350 --> 02:29.519
Thank you Aero, you've given me

02:29.520 --> 02:32.129
a wonderful visual I can spank to later.

02:32.130 --> 02:33.709
For another 100, I promise to think

02:33.710 --> 02:35.819
of you when I'm pumping
the muffin later.

02:35.820 --> 02:37.239
Hell, I'm sharing a
room with this loser.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.389
It's worth 100 just to
know he's not a fag.

02:39.390 --> 02:41.989
Oh, how sweet.

02:41.990 --> 02:44.040
Maybe you can help him
rub one out later.

02:51.730 --> 02:54.499
It's expensive?
Yeah.

02:54.500 --> 02:58.259
I spent 40 grand on that a year ago.

02:58.260 --> 03:00.559
Now it's worth 100.
Wow,

03:00.560 --> 03:02.849
100 grand for a painting.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.759
Yeah, crazy huh?

03:05.760 --> 03:08.339
But I've spent a lot more since then.

03:08.340 --> 03:10.799
I have a Chagall,

03:10.800 --> 03:11.680
Manet,

03:12.879 --> 03:15.489
a couple of Picassos.
I heard of him.

03:15.490 --> 03:16.323
Did ya?

03:20.130 --> 03:23.060
I think that's my favorite one.

03:24.240 --> 03:25.799
I'm not sure why but I think

03:25.800 --> 03:28.370
because it's the first one I ever bought

03:29.630 --> 03:31.580
and I remember thinking someday,

03:32.460 --> 03:34.989
I'd have a collection of original

03:34.990 --> 03:37.190
artworks to fill up my whole house.

03:38.970 --> 03:41.669
This is a great office.

03:41.670 --> 03:43.570
So do you really own the whole casino?

03:44.650 --> 03:46.270
Yeah, I sure do.

03:47.570 --> 03:49.249
I made some wise moves over the years.

03:49.250 --> 03:50.800
What can I say, I'm a genius.

03:52.280 --> 03:55.500
That is so fucking cool.
Yeah baby, it sure is.

03:56.954 --> 03:58.929
We should go over to my place because

03:58.930 --> 04:02.209
I have some really amazing things.

04:02.210 --> 04:04.518
I bet you have a huge house.

04:04.519 --> 04:06.186
Oh yeah, it's like

04:07.998 --> 04:10.579
tremendous.
Is it a mansion?

04:10.580 --> 04:11.413
Yeah.

04:12.412 --> 04:13.412
Wanna go for a ride?

04:15.140 --> 04:15.973
Let's go.

04:18.820 --> 04:21.620
I have to be home by one,
otherwise my dad will freak.

04:26.127 --> 04:27.639
So why don't
you tell me what you

04:27.640 --> 04:29.929
did in school today, do
you have any homework?

04:29.930 --> 04:32.639
Well, we had a
multiplication test today.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.659
I'm pretty sure I did good on that

04:34.660 --> 04:36.889
and Laura got sent to
the principal's office

04:36.890 --> 04:39.390
for throwing paper towels
on the bathroom ceiling.

04:40.920 --> 04:42.530
Mom.
Yes, honey?

04:43.510 --> 04:46.269
All your friends are really cool, but

04:46.270 --> 04:50.079
sometimes I wish dad was around, too.

04:50.080 --> 04:52.350
Yeah, me too honey, sometimes.

04:53.611 --> 04:56.789
But when I think of what
it'd be like having dad around,

04:56.790 --> 04:59.469
it's not really him I don't think.

04:59.470 --> 05:01.012
What do you mean?

05:01.013 --> 05:03.129
I mean, when I think of him, it looks

05:03.130 --> 05:05.910
like him but he's nicer than I remember.

05:06.918 --> 05:08.068
What do you remember?

05:08.960 --> 05:11.819
I remember him yelling a
lot and you crying a lot.

05:11.820 --> 05:14.070
But I don't know if
that's how it really was.

05:15.230 --> 05:17.440
Yes honey, that's how it was.

05:18.290 --> 05:21.769
Which is why when I miss him,
it's not that I want him back.

05:21.770 --> 05:24.149
I just wish he were a different person,

05:24.150 --> 05:26.669
a better person like you.

05:26.670 --> 05:29.059
Maybe he's a better person now.

05:29.060 --> 05:32.259
I wish that were true
but it's not how it works.

05:32.260 --> 05:35.179
I was kind of hoping he'd
show up for my birthday but

05:35.180 --> 05:36.930
I guess I kind of knew he wouldn't.

05:37.850 --> 05:39.539
He's never coming back, honey.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.559
But it's got nothing to do with you.

05:41.560 --> 05:44.109
All the decisions he
makes are about him.

05:44.110 --> 05:45.589
Some people are just like that.

05:45.590 --> 05:48.599
You're not like that, you're
the best mom in the world.

05:48.600 --> 05:49.750
I'd like to think so.

05:50.640 --> 05:54.099
Besides, it's easy when you
have the best kid in the world.

05:54.100 --> 05:56.329
I bet you'd never miss my birthday.

05:56.330 --> 06:00.130
Never, I'll always be there
for you, you know that right?

06:01.830 --> 06:02.663
I love you, Josh.

06:02.664 --> 06:04.500
Come here, give me a hug.
I love you, too.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.209
Ouch mom, you're crushing me.

06:08.210 --> 06:09.339
I never hear you complain when

06:09.340 --> 06:11.419
Lexie gives you a big squeeze like that.

06:11.420 --> 06:12.839
She's gonna be there, isn't she?

06:12.840 --> 06:14.919
She'll be there.
We gotta go back inside.

06:14.920 --> 06:16.559
Why?
I forgot something.

06:16.560 --> 06:18.396
What?
You'll see.

06:19.470 --> 06:21.470
How many other girls are gonna be there?

06:35.890 --> 06:37.930
Thank you, Josh.
Hey guys.

06:39.100 --> 06:40.970
Okay, this was totally his idea.

06:45.210 --> 06:46.043
Thank you.

06:49.470 --> 06:51.609
I was only gonna get one for you but

06:51.610 --> 06:54.959
I didn't wanna hurt their
feelings so I got them one, too.

06:54.960 --> 06:56.520
That's just sweet.

06:57.823 --> 06:58.990
Do you wanna go swimming?

07:11.220 --> 07:12.220
Throw him.

07:15.139 --> 07:17.349
Hey, what's under your arm right here?

07:17.350 --> 07:18.645
It's nothing.
Are you sure?

07:18.646 --> 07:19.479
Yeah.

07:19.480 --> 07:20.779
Hey, there's something under his arm.

07:20.780 --> 07:21.735
Lemme see.

07:21.735 --> 07:22.660
Come here.
It's nothing.

07:22.661 --> 07:24.396
What is it?
It's nothing.

07:24.397 --> 07:28.326
Let me just...

07:28.327 --> 07:30.327
You're a troublemaker.

07:31.692 --> 07:32.525
Uh-oh.

07:42.450 --> 07:44.859
How's a going in there, sport?

07:44.860 --> 07:47.460
This is too cool! This
is the best game ever.

07:49.100 --> 07:51.159
Damn girlie, you must
be way desperate to be

07:51.160 --> 07:54.049
using a PlayStation to
lure guys to your place.

07:54.050 --> 07:55.469
What, you got a thing for virgins now?

07:55.470 --> 07:57.870
Are you saying there's
any in town you missed?

07:59.158 --> 08:00.439
No, it's Mike's.

08:00.440 --> 08:02.679
He's playing some game of
only remembering it's here

08:02.680 --> 08:05.330
around midnight, it's
been here for four months.

08:06.300 --> 08:08.909
He's trying to get a booty
call out of the deal.

08:08.910 --> 08:11.589
My goodness, in my
opinion, after it's been

08:11.590 --> 08:14.160
abandoned for four months,
it's officially yours.

08:15.310 --> 08:18.009
I'm not quite ready for
that yet but if it happens,

08:18.010 --> 08:20.319
Josh can have it.
Shh, not so loud.

08:20.320 --> 08:21.559
I don't want him to get his hopes up.

08:21.560 --> 08:24.379
Okay, who's hungry?
Ooh, I am.

08:24.380 --> 08:25.960
Josh, food's ready.

08:30.340 --> 08:32.359
Got room in there after all those sodas?

08:32.360 --> 08:34.370
I got room for more hugs.
Oh.

08:35.602 --> 08:36.852
How adorable.

08:39.458 --> 08:41.792
Little Josh.
That's good.

08:46.587 --> 08:51.419
Yes yes yes, yes.

08:51.420 --> 08:53.519
It's leukemia, Kora.

08:53.520 --> 08:56.369
But we've found it very early.

08:56.370 --> 08:59.080
We're actually lucky I
think, all things considered.

09:00.210 --> 09:03.220
We can get a handle on
this, really we can.

09:05.688 --> 09:08.080
He can't die, he's all I've got.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.300
He's not gonna die.

09:11.370 --> 09:13.470
Jesus Christ, he's only eight years old.

09:37.228 --> 09:38.061
Hey, honey.

09:41.858 --> 09:42.941
Hey!

10:01.020 --> 10:02.120
How's it going, guys?

10:03.130 --> 10:05.029
Hey, what's the word from Kora?

10:05.030 --> 10:07.599
They get back from the
place in Colorado tomorrow

10:07.600 --> 10:10.459
and they caught it in
time but he's definitely

10:10.460 --> 10:12.829
gonna have to have a
bone marrow transplant.

10:12.830 --> 10:14.649
Jesus, I heard that's harrowing.

10:14.650 --> 10:16.859
It is, but they have a donor already.

10:16.860 --> 10:18.469
What?

10:18.470 --> 10:21.369
That's amazing, I thought
that would be the hard part.

10:21.370 --> 10:23.169
It is but they put his information in

10:23.170 --> 10:26.249
the database and they
found somebody right away.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.829
That must be such a relief.
Yeah.

10:28.830 --> 10:30.759
Things are really coming together right.

10:30.760 --> 10:34.009
Still, it must be
fuckin' scary for Kora.

10:34.010 --> 10:38.399
Yeah, I mean when I found
out, I could hardly sleep.

10:38.400 --> 10:41.159
I can't imagine what
she's going through.

10:41.160 --> 10:43.149
Raine.
Yeah?

10:43.150 --> 10:44.259
Are you on your break?

10:44.260 --> 10:46.049
That's just where I'm headed.

10:46.050 --> 10:48.359
Well maybe you can head
there a little faster.

10:48.360 --> 10:51.069
Or can you not go that
fast in those second hand

10:51.070 --> 10:54.309
80s stripper shoes without
falling flat on your face?

10:54.310 --> 10:55.669
Oh hey, do you want me to get you

10:55.670 --> 10:58.299
some more cake if there's any left?

10:58.300 --> 11:01.749
Nevermind, I can see you've had plenty.

11:01.750 --> 11:03.559
Bitch, take your break
and if they implement

11:03.560 --> 11:05.759
a dirty whore curfew
in the next 20 minutes,

11:05.760 --> 11:07.310
I'll call you and let you know.

11:22.600 --> 11:25.009
Well young man, how would
you feel about coming back

11:25.010 --> 11:27.529
in a few weeks, see if we
can make you all better?

11:27.530 --> 11:28.619
Really?

11:28.620 --> 11:31.339
Everything is good, Dr. Buttu was right.

11:31.340 --> 11:32.519
We caught it very early and that

11:32.520 --> 11:33.960
often makes a world of difference.

11:35.040 --> 11:37.739
Oh my god, thank you,
thank you, that's amazing.

11:37.740 --> 11:38.573
Thank you.

11:39.728 --> 11:42.479
Thank you so much, thank you.

11:42.480 --> 11:43.313
Oh my god, baby.

11:57.530 --> 11:59.489
Friday's my last day.

11:59.490 --> 12:01.089
How long you gotta be out for?

12:01.090 --> 12:02.779
Probably two months.

12:02.780 --> 12:05.629
The transplant itself
isn't the hard part.

12:05.630 --> 12:08.799
It's that he's gonna have to
have chemo before and after.

12:08.800 --> 12:11.359
He's gonna be miserable
for weeks while his

12:11.360 --> 12:13.349
immune system is fighting
its way back to normal.

12:13.350 --> 12:16.519
That means you're gonna
miss the Pajama Bash.

12:16.520 --> 12:20.769
Yeah, well, I'll miss the
money but I won't miss drunk,

12:20.770 --> 12:25.649
obnoxious cigar-smoking L.A.
dorks that think that somehow

12:25.650 --> 12:28.479
crossing the state line
suddenly transforms them into

12:28.480 --> 12:31.721
slick playboys and that they
can get whatever they want.

12:31.722 --> 12:33.549
Listen, for $500 a night,

12:33.550 --> 12:36.469
you can throw all the L.A.
nerd patrol at me you want.

12:36.470 --> 12:38.160
Full badges, everything.

12:40.660 --> 12:43.469
Hey, where have you been?

12:43.470 --> 12:46.709
I haven't seen you in like forever.

12:46.710 --> 12:48.289
I went to days for a couple months

12:48.290 --> 12:50.679
so I could help my mom in the evenings.

12:50.680 --> 12:52.989
How's she doing?
She's good.

12:52.990 --> 12:54.810
She's doing better, thanks.

12:56.247 --> 12:58.309
God, I miss having you around.

12:58.310 --> 12:59.869
Me, too.

12:59.870 --> 13:02.340
So I heard about Josh. How's he doing?

13:03.270 --> 13:06.039
It's been really scary but
we just got back from this

13:06.040 --> 13:09.239
place in Colorado and they say
everything's gonna be fine.

13:09.240 --> 13:11.899
Wow, great! That's really great.

13:11.900 --> 13:13.160
I've been worried for you.

13:16.910 --> 13:20.179
I got him something.
Oh my god Neil, you didn't.

13:20.180 --> 13:23.999
It's nothing, I mean I won
it and I don't have time for

13:24.000 --> 13:27.040
this and I figured what eight
year old wouldn't want one?

13:27.960 --> 13:30.579
I don't know what to say.

13:30.580 --> 13:31.729
He doesn't have one, does he?

13:31.730 --> 13:34.679
No, and you couldn't
have picked a better gift.

13:34.680 --> 13:35.980
He's gonna love it.

13:38.820 --> 13:41.069
These are expensive, are you sure?

13:41.070 --> 13:43.470
Of course. Oh, and there's
a game in there, too.

13:44.421 --> 13:45.971
It's supposed to be a good one.

13:47.818 --> 13:49.899
All right, time to go.
Yeah.

13:49.900 --> 13:51.819
You better hustle up the locker room

13:51.820 --> 13:54.069
if you want to get
that in there in time.

13:54.070 --> 13:55.670
Thank you so much, Neil.

13:57.662 --> 13:58.795
You rock.

14:24.350 --> 14:28.259
Dear Ms. Elwin, we regret
to inform you that due

14:28.260 --> 14:31.229
to the experimental nature
of the treatment being

14:31.230 --> 14:35.479
recommended for Joshua, per
the terms of your policy, we

14:35.480 --> 14:38.839
won't be able to approve the
procedure through our network.

14:38.840 --> 14:40.889
How the fuck is this even possible?

14:40.890 --> 14:43.459
I don't, I don't understand.

14:43.460 --> 14:45.709
This is what insurance is for.

14:45.710 --> 14:47.257
We'll call them, maybe they...

14:47.258 --> 14:49.609
I did, I called them
before I called you.

14:49.610 --> 14:52.899
They won't cover it, they
say it's experimental

14:52.900 --> 14:55.240
but really it's just too expensive.

14:57.450 --> 14:59.219
It's too fucking expensive,

14:59.220 --> 15:01.229
so they're just gonna let Josh die.

15:01.230 --> 15:03.380
Did they tell you
how much at the clinic?

15:04.600 --> 15:06.740
It's over $200,000.

15:07.830 --> 15:09.449
I mean I wasn't even
paying attention because

15:09.450 --> 15:11.450
I was sure the insurance would cover it.

15:13.670 --> 15:15.910
The insurance is my only hope.

15:16.910 --> 15:19.709
There is nowhere I can go
for that kind of money.

15:19.710 --> 15:23.190
We'll figure it out,
we will get the money.

15:24.440 --> 15:27.150
In fact, I already have an idea.

15:30.670 --> 15:35.149
You know it's really
awful. It's disgusting.

15:35.150 --> 15:36.070
It makes me sick.

15:37.010 --> 15:39.159
Considering how much money I'm
paying out in premiums every

15:39.160 --> 15:42.430
year, I'm surprised they would
pull something like that.

15:43.920 --> 15:46.269
I was hoping that
maybe you could call them

15:46.270 --> 15:49.120
and maybe encourage them
to approve the operation.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.439
There are thousands of
these done every year,

15:52.440 --> 15:54.549
it's not experimental.

15:54.550 --> 15:56.149
It's just a game they're playing to

15:56.150 --> 15:58.470
deny paying out the
money to save my son.

16:00.921 --> 16:03.209
You know I can't make you any promises,

16:03.210 --> 16:04.510
that wouldn't be right but

16:06.810 --> 16:09.859
I can say that we'll
look into it for you.

16:09.860 --> 16:11.247
For you and...

16:12.540 --> 16:13.470
Josh.
Yeah.

16:15.200 --> 16:17.500
You know, a couple hundred
thousand dollars is

16:18.530 --> 16:22.070
a lot of money for someone
like yourself or even for me.

16:23.610 --> 16:24.829
But it's just a drop in the bucket

16:24.830 --> 16:27.010
for these big, billion dollar companies.

16:28.520 --> 16:31.240
I can promise you Carter
and I will look into it.

16:33.079 --> 16:34.209
Thank you, thank you so much.

16:34.210 --> 16:37.176
Thank God, thank you, Mr. Belding.

16:37.177 --> 16:40.029
You don't have to thank
me, it's the least I can do.

16:40.030 --> 16:42.299
I know you and the girls are
doing a great job down there.

16:42.300 --> 16:44.899
Thank you, thank you.
All right.

16:44.900 --> 16:45.733
Hey, Billy.

16:47.620 --> 16:48.789
Hey, boss.

16:48.790 --> 16:51.189
Listen, go ahead and
take your box and Don

16:51.190 --> 16:53.639
and Sammy's but leave Pam's here, okay?

16:53.640 --> 16:54.710
Sure, got it.

16:56.480 --> 16:59.299
Why you gotta
put me on the spot?

16:59.300 --> 17:00.133
What?

17:01.180 --> 17:03.099
You put me on the fuckin' spot.

17:03.100 --> 17:05.729
I didn't put you on the
spot, her kid's dying.

17:05.730 --> 17:07.189
I can't do anything about that.

17:07.190 --> 17:09.868
Look, I just thought if
maybe we called the insurance

17:09.869 --> 17:12.939
company, we could probably
work something out, you know?

17:12.940 --> 17:14.040
It's worth a shot.

17:14.940 --> 17:16.329
Well, that ain't gonna happen.

17:16.329 --> 17:18.530
I'm not gonna put the
strong-arm on anybody.

17:19.670 --> 17:21.638
I got the best rate in town with WPN,

17:21.640 --> 17:22.839
the best deal I can get.

17:24.760 --> 17:27.839
Besides that, I'm not even
gonna make a phone call

17:27.839 --> 17:30.359
even to bluff them
considering the fact I'm

17:30.360 --> 17:33.149
not able to go anyplace
else and if I do,

17:33.150 --> 17:34.619
it's gonna cost me another $2 million.

17:34.620 --> 17:37.269
You don't have to strong-arm anybody.

17:37.270 --> 17:40.749
I just figured if maybe
you made the call,

17:40.750 --> 17:43.609
you could get 'em to reverse
their position on this.

17:43.610 --> 17:45.239
You know what?

17:45.240 --> 17:46.440
Kora's not even married.

17:50.440 --> 17:52.390
If she would've kept her legs together,

17:54.520 --> 17:56.720
none of this would even
be happening, would it?

18:03.462 --> 18:06.648
You want me to make the call?

18:06.649 --> 18:07.649
If there's one thing
I know, it's insurance

18:07.650 --> 18:09.910
companies and I don't
think they're gonna budge.

18:11.550 --> 18:14.060
I don't even wanna call in
a favor unless I need it.

18:15.660 --> 18:17.410
You already threw me under the bus.

18:20.405 --> 18:22.019
Listen, when we go back
to her, we'll tell

18:22.020 --> 18:25.060
her it's a no-go and
I'll be the bad guy.

18:26.476 --> 18:27.659
So no call?

18:30.200 --> 18:32.688
On Tuesday, we'll tell her that

18:32.689 --> 18:35.579
the insurance company wouldn't budge.

18:35.580 --> 18:37.250
Let them take the fall.

18:39.811 --> 18:40.811
All right.

19:00.300 --> 19:01.500
Raine, you got a second?

19:02.995 --> 19:04.489
It looks like Dean's having an

19:04.490 --> 19:06.537
issue with the insurance company.

19:06.538 --> 19:09.070
They're gonna deny Josh's
bone marrow transplant.

19:10.040 --> 19:12.089
Motherfuckers.

19:12.090 --> 19:13.579
I just thought it was
better coming from you

19:13.580 --> 19:16.989
than, you know, me
calling her on the phone.

19:16.990 --> 19:18.349
Yeah, you're right.

19:18.350 --> 19:20.220
Let me know if there's
anything else I can do.

19:22.754 --> 19:23.587
Thanks.

19:27.750 --> 19:28.583
Hey.

19:30.319 --> 19:31.949
Hey.
Hey, Josh.

19:31.950 --> 19:34.793
Hey, guys.
What's up, you guys?

19:34.794 --> 19:36.627
Okay, thanks.
Lexie!

19:38.540 --> 19:40.862
Every time.
Hey, buddy.

19:40.863 --> 19:42.572
Like we're not even here.

19:42.573 --> 19:43.729
How are you?
Good.

19:43.730 --> 19:47.439
Wow, I didn't know it was
gonna be a party. What's up?

19:47.440 --> 19:48.669
Lexie, can you take Josh

19:48.670 --> 19:51.529
to his room so we can talk?
You bet.

19:51.530 --> 19:53.529
You mind showing me your room, big guy?

19:53.530 --> 19:57.189
As long as you don't
try any funny business.

19:57.190 --> 19:59.440
Whoa.
I'll try to behave.

20:00.960 --> 20:02.369
You better because if you turn my son

20:02.370 --> 20:04.510
into a pervert, I'll kick your butt.

20:10.190 --> 20:11.390
It's bad news, isn't it?

20:12.330 --> 20:13.609
Carter and Mr. Belding didn't

20:13.610 --> 20:15.670
have any luck with the
insurance company.

20:16.590 --> 20:20.269
I knew it, goddammit,
I knew it, fucking hell.

20:20.270 --> 20:22.339
We're all really pissed about it.

20:22.340 --> 20:24.179
So, we've been thinking and we think

20:24.180 --> 20:26.239
we may have come up with another idea.

20:26.240 --> 20:29.589
We've raised some money for
you guys, it's about 11 grand.

20:29.590 --> 20:32.219
It's all from the casino
staff, but we plan

20:32.220 --> 20:34.620
on asking the rest of the
staff on the property.

20:35.760 --> 20:37.799
Oh wow, honey thank you.

20:37.800 --> 20:38.633
Wow.

20:39.771 --> 20:42.469
I still don't know what
to do though because I've

20:42.470 --> 20:45.069
put most of my money into the
down payment of this house

20:45.070 --> 20:47.669
and I think I can probably
get about 15 grand

20:47.670 --> 20:52.670
on my credit cards, but
we're talking $200,000!

20:52.840 --> 20:55.949
We could do about
another 35, the four of us,

20:55.950 --> 20:58.329
savings and credit cards.

20:58.330 --> 21:00.149
Oh my goodness, you guys.

21:00.150 --> 21:03.319
I'd love to say I won't let you do this

21:03.320 --> 21:05.560
but you know I would
do anything for Josh.

21:06.820 --> 21:10.379
It still wouldn't be
anywhere near what we need.

21:10.380 --> 21:12.899
Well, that's where
our other idea comes in.

21:12.900 --> 21:13.750
Okay.

21:14.730 --> 21:17.994
We're gonna ask Mr.
Belding to lend it to you.

21:17.995 --> 21:19.869
Okay, that's not gonna happen.

21:19.870 --> 21:23.119
He's not gonna lend me money.
Yeah, you're right.

21:23.120 --> 21:25.049
He's never gonna lend you that money.

21:25.050 --> 21:28.029
He's actually not
particularly fond of you.

21:28.030 --> 21:29.879
But, I'll explain that later.

21:29.880 --> 21:32.549
But, when he shoots
you down on the loan,

21:32.550 --> 21:34.469
we're gonna hit him
up with another favor

21:34.470 --> 21:36.980
and I think it's one
he might go along with.

21:38.357 --> 21:41.378
Okay, I'm listening.

21:41.379 --> 21:43.029
I haven't learned how to play it

21:43.030 --> 21:44.119
but it's gonna be really cool.

21:44.120 --> 21:45.519
You get to fight monsters,

21:45.520 --> 21:48.089
get weapons and use magic and stuff.

21:48.090 --> 21:51.219
This looks very cool, Josh.

21:51.220 --> 21:53.819
Will you play once mom
and me get it figured out?

21:53.820 --> 21:57.140
Absolutely, I'd feel left
out if you didn't invite me.

21:58.165 --> 22:00.315
We can play in our
swimsuits if you want.

22:01.860 --> 22:04.980
I am not gonna tell
your mom you said that.

22:06.510 --> 22:08.659
Whose idea was this?

22:08.660 --> 22:10.739
It was mine, thank you very much.

22:10.740 --> 22:12.069
And you're all up for this?

22:12.070 --> 22:15.569
We got Celeste, Veda and Tempest too.

22:15.570 --> 22:19.259
I'm just amazed, it would've
never crossed my mind.

22:19.260 --> 22:22.009
Not ours either, but you know Aero,

22:22.010 --> 22:23.959
she's our resident deviant.

22:23.960 --> 22:26.419
And you think Dean
will go along with this?

22:26.420 --> 22:27.729
I don't see why not.

22:27.730 --> 22:29.529
Let's hit him up on Monday.

22:29.530 --> 22:30.363
Okay.

22:32.550 --> 22:33.510
Let me go first.

22:34.710 --> 22:37.420
I got the flamethrower,
I'll blast 'em with fire.

22:43.030 --> 22:44.479
Ew, nice game Neil.

22:44.480 --> 22:46.979
Couldn't you find anything more violent?

22:46.980 --> 22:49.179
My mom thinks this is too violent, Neil.

22:49.180 --> 22:50.830
But I think it rocks.

22:52.170 --> 22:53.003
Neil?

22:54.980 --> 22:56.179
Oops.

22:56.180 --> 22:58.680
Are you playing this
game with Neil from work?

22:59.610 --> 23:00.729
Yeah.

23:00.730 --> 23:02.940
I wasn't supposed to
say anything though.

23:03.860 --> 23:05.049
Sorry, Neil.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.490
Josh, give me the headset.

23:14.150 --> 23:15.240
Hello, Sergeant.

23:25.680 --> 23:26.930
All right, start talking.

23:28.720 --> 23:31.559
Look, I figured if you knew,
you wouldn't accept it.

23:31.560 --> 23:32.979
That's right.

23:32.980 --> 23:35.577
I appreciate it but you
shouldn't have done it

23:35.578 --> 23:37.710
and you certainly shouldn't
have lied about it.

23:38.860 --> 23:42.339
Look, I can't imagine what
you're going through with Josh.

23:42.340 --> 23:44.789
But the thing is I was out
of work for seven months

23:44.790 --> 23:47.189
less than a year after
I started working here.

23:47.190 --> 23:49.829
Yeah, your accident, I remember.

23:49.830 --> 23:51.769
That's right, I was in
and out of the hospital

23:51.770 --> 23:54.289
and I was cooped up in
my apartment all day.

23:54.290 --> 23:55.939
I was going nuts.

23:55.940 --> 23:59.379
My brother got me a PlayStation
Two and I was hooked.

23:59.380 --> 24:01.209
No shit, I'd never been into

24:01.210 --> 24:03.700
video games as a kid but I got into it.

24:05.130 --> 24:06.489
You should see some of the games

24:06.490 --> 24:08.190
they have now, they're incredible.

24:09.130 --> 24:10.319
You're a chick, I wouldn't expect

24:10.320 --> 24:12.320
you to understand but I knew Josh would.

24:13.570 --> 24:16.529
Yeah, he's loving it.
I knew it.

24:16.530 --> 24:19.230
Oh, and I'm sorry if the
game's a little violent.

24:20.120 --> 24:23.280
But it's a great game and he's
getting really good at it.

24:25.150 --> 24:26.929
Well, now that the cat's out of the bag,

24:26.930 --> 24:29.619
you should come over and
spend some time with him.

24:29.620 --> 24:31.489
He's got this really crazy, complicated

24:31.490 --> 24:33.859
board game that he's dying to show you.

24:33.860 --> 24:36.199
It's got like 1,000 pieces, magic

24:36.200 --> 24:39.369
and monsters and all this other stuff

24:39.370 --> 24:41.829
and I don't understand it at all.

24:41.830 --> 24:43.330
Sounds awesome to me.

24:50.160 --> 24:52.110
I feel terrible about your situation.

24:53.300 --> 24:55.739
I really do but I can't make a habit

24:55.740 --> 24:57.640
out of loaning money to staff members.

24:59.860 --> 25:01.510
I mean granted, your situation is

25:04.860 --> 25:06.320
dire, but

25:08.360 --> 25:11.743
how can I say no to the next
person that comes along?

25:11.744 --> 25:15.009
If I give you 200 grand, the
next thing I know, someone's

25:15.010 --> 25:17.660
gonna want a kidney transplant,
ask me to pay for it.

25:18.775 --> 25:21.819
Wouldn't even be an issue
if the insurance wasn't fuck-,

25:21.820 --> 25:25.460
screwing her around.
No, I understand, I do.

25:28.429 --> 25:30.499
I'm very glad to hear that.

25:30.500 --> 25:32.359
We do have one other idea,

25:32.360 --> 25:35.509
it's kind of a fundraiser for Kora.

25:35.510 --> 25:37.389
Sounds interesting.

25:37.390 --> 25:40.009
It's actually Aero's idea, but all

25:40.010 --> 25:42.499
the girls in the Sin Pit are on board.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.250
Provided you guys are okay with it.

25:47.240 --> 25:48.778
How can I help?

25:49.543 --> 25:50.939
We'd like to make a
calendar and release it

25:50.940 --> 25:53.609
in conjunction with the
Pajama Party next month.

25:53.610 --> 25:56.619
All the guys who play
here want to see more of us.

25:56.620 --> 25:58.930
We're willing to show it to 'em

25:58.931 --> 26:02.790
in the form of sexy calendars
for a $100 donation.

26:04.330 --> 26:06.209
We've already got
eight stores around town

26:06.210 --> 26:08.850
ready to commit and we're
talking to several more.

26:11.448 --> 26:12.673
What do you think?

26:12.697 --> 26:13.821
What do you mean what do I think?

26:13.822 --> 26:17.250
I love it, sexy calendars.

26:19.230 --> 26:22.180
I couldn't agree more, $100 is

26:23.240 --> 26:24.260
kinda steep.

26:26.310 --> 26:28.989
But I guess it's a fundraiser

26:28.990 --> 26:31.298
and we're not spending
our own money, right?

26:31.299 --> 26:32.709
So,

26:32.710 --> 26:34.030
I don't see the harm in it.

26:34.970 --> 26:37.509
Thank you, thank you so much.

26:37.510 --> 26:38.560
I'll tell you what.

26:39.930 --> 26:42.030
We'll even buy everything
you've got left.

26:42.964 --> 26:46.360
Put in in the gift shop, kinda
like a little backup plan.

26:47.472 --> 26:50.480
Of course it's up to you girls
to move as much as you can.

26:51.710 --> 26:54.980
We figured that, that's no
problem at all, thank you.

26:57.869 --> 27:01.369
Can't wait to see what you come up with.

27:05.940 --> 27:07.499
Hey.

27:07.500 --> 27:09.010
Hey there.
Come in.

27:10.050 --> 27:11.329
Is Josh here?

27:11.330 --> 27:14.189
The 2:00 show was sold
out, so he's at the 4:10.

27:14.190 --> 27:17.099
They just called, I would've
let you know sooner, sorry.

27:17.100 --> 27:19.600
No biggie, I don't have
to be at work 'til nine.

27:20.540 --> 27:21.949
Want to get something to eat?

27:21.950 --> 27:23.929
I'd love to, but let's
wait 'til Josh gets back.

27:23.930 --> 27:26.349
They haven't eaten either.
Oh yeah, of course.

27:26.350 --> 27:28.960
I wasn't thinking.
Do you want a drink?

27:30.030 --> 27:31.339
Sure.

27:31.340 --> 27:33.919
Beer, soda, water?

27:33.920 --> 27:36.669
A nice frosty longneck would be great.

27:36.670 --> 27:38.079
Dull my nerves in anticipation

27:38.080 --> 27:40.233
of another long night of monotony.

27:40.234 --> 27:41.530
One brewski coming right up.

27:44.083 --> 27:46.279
Is Josh out with his dad?

27:46.280 --> 27:48.409
No, that took him
like three years to even

27:48.410 --> 27:51.520
try the dad thing and it
lasted a whole four months.

27:52.879 --> 27:54.340
I'm sorry. That sucks.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.020
It must be hard for both of you.

27:59.770 --> 28:01.109
I got over it.

28:01.110 --> 28:03.560
I just hate that Josh will
never know his father.

28:04.470 --> 28:06.039
Thank god I have my mom here to help

28:06.040 --> 28:07.950
me out or I wouldn't know what I'd do.

28:09.796 --> 28:11.546
Yeah, I bet.

28:14.060 --> 28:16.690
Josh went to the movies with Lexie.

28:18.340 --> 28:19.970
From work?
Mm hmm.

28:21.090 --> 28:22.050
Why didn't you go?

28:22.051 --> 28:25.653
I want to but he didn't want
to bring his mom on a date.

28:25.654 --> 28:27.569
He said it would cramp his style.

28:27.570 --> 28:29.650
No, he didn't.
Yes, he did.

28:30.590 --> 28:32.929
I wonder where he got that from?

28:32.930 --> 28:33.763
Not me.

28:34.980 --> 28:37.430
Seriously, it wasn't me
but that's funny as shit.

28:39.550 --> 28:40.559
I just don't want him to turn

28:40.560 --> 28:42.300
into a dog when he gets older.

28:43.770 --> 28:45.870
Sometimes it just comes with the gender.

28:47.900 --> 28:50.620
I know it's a little
late but I wanna apologize.

28:52.610 --> 28:53.809
For what?

28:53.810 --> 28:55.410
For how I treated you at work.

28:57.400 --> 28:58.799
What are you talking about?

28:58.800 --> 28:59.750
The last couple of months

28:59.751 --> 29:02.229
before I transferred into the Sin Pit.

29:02.230 --> 29:04.409
You didn't do anything to me.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.629
You know what I'm talking about.

29:06.630 --> 29:08.809
I kept ignoring you and I always felt

29:08.810 --> 29:11.836
shitty about it because
you were my best friend.

29:11.837 --> 29:13.969
I figured you had your reasons.

29:13.970 --> 29:15.370
I didn't take it personally.

29:16.670 --> 29:17.699
Well,

29:17.700 --> 29:18.740
not too personally.

29:22.560 --> 29:24.570
Can I come clean here?
Mm hmm.

29:25.660 --> 29:29.500
I loved landing on breaks
with you. I really did.

29:32.572 --> 29:34.549
Toward the end there,
and don't think I have

29:34.550 --> 29:36.929
a big head or anything,
but I thought you were

29:36.930 --> 29:40.549
gonna ask me out and I
didn't want you to because

29:40.550 --> 29:43.099
I knew I was gonna turn you
down and I didn't want things

29:43.100 --> 29:46.560
to get how they get once
something like that is out there.

29:48.260 --> 29:51.370
I wasn't gonna ask you out.
No?

29:52.879 --> 29:53.712
No.

29:55.660 --> 29:57.478
Well...

29:57.479 --> 29:58.850
Don't I feel like an ass.

30:00.620 --> 30:03.410
Don't, it's not that I didn't want to.

30:06.560 --> 30:07.860
I had a huge crush on you.

30:11.020 --> 30:13.809
I didn't ask you out
because I figured you'd

30:13.810 --> 30:17.389
turn me down and I didn't
want things to get, you know,

30:17.390 --> 30:19.890
how they get when something
like that's out there.

30:21.680 --> 30:24.369
Of course, we drifted
apart anyway didn't we?

30:24.370 --> 30:26.830
I'm sorry about that.
Yeah, me too.

30:28.430 --> 30:29.959
So you did have a crush on me?

30:29.960 --> 30:30.793
Stop it.

30:33.570 --> 30:34.403
Did you?

30:35.390 --> 30:38.289
Maybe a little one.
A little one?

30:38.290 --> 30:40.089
I thought you said you
had a big crush on me.

30:40.090 --> 30:42.969
Actually I think the
word you used was huge.

30:42.970 --> 30:45.889
Don't tease me or I'll take it back.

30:45.890 --> 30:47.369
You can't take it back.
Oh no.

30:47.370 --> 30:51.819
I can take it back and I will.
Okay you win, I believe you.

30:51.820 --> 30:54.010
Please don't take it back, I'll behave.

30:59.480 --> 31:01.329
Okay, I want a beer now.

31:01.330 --> 31:04.860
Do you want another one?
No, not yet, thanks.

31:19.467 --> 31:21.417
What did you have in mind for dinner?

31:22.910 --> 31:25.050
I'm easy. What does Josh like?

31:26.360 --> 31:29.310
If it was up to Josh,
we'd have burgers every day.

31:30.800 --> 31:33.659
Do you wanna just meet
them at the restaurant?

31:33.660 --> 31:35.810
Yeah, that's
probably a good idea.

31:38.770 --> 31:39.603
Well,

31:40.660 --> 31:42.260
what do you wanna do until then?

31:49.579 --> 31:51.990
I said what do you wanna
do for a couple of hours?

31:56.630 --> 31:58.880
We could go to the mall
and kill some time.

33:50.784 --> 33:53.149
And he was on this
cart and he shot himself

33:53.150 --> 33:55.519
across the room and he
grabs this button thing

33:55.520 --> 33:57.819
and pushes it just as
he gets to the window.

33:57.820 --> 34:00.329
He goes flying through the
windows just as a rocket

34:00.330 --> 34:03.279
shoots and hits the building
right under the window.

34:03.280 --> 34:05.269
But there was a cable attached to it.

34:05.270 --> 34:09.259
So just as he starts to
fall, he grabs the wire.

34:09.260 --> 34:12.039
He slides down the wire,
the guards run to

34:12.040 --> 34:14.559
the window and just as
they're about to shoot him,

34:14.560 --> 34:16.509
the bomb goes off and kills him.

34:16.510 --> 34:18.109
He gets to the bottom and the other

34:18.110 --> 34:19.980
guy picks him up with a motorcycle.

34:21.110 --> 34:23.440
Then the whole army comes after them.

34:24.929 --> 34:27.280
He ends up running through...
You little slut.

34:28.719 --> 34:31.099
On to this hill with a water slide.

34:31.100 --> 34:34.429
This guy tackles him and...
Was she good?

34:34.429 --> 34:37.079
While the other
guys are shooting at him.

34:37.080 --> 34:39.719
He runs to the water
and gets away from him.

34:39.719 --> 34:42.208
She was, huh?
And the other soldiers get

34:42.210 --> 34:44.940
other wave-runners and
start to chase him.

34:46.255 --> 34:47.089
Well?

34:47.090 --> 34:48.329
Then the helicopter comes

34:48.330 --> 34:50.349
and they fight and his
buddy pulls him out.

34:50.350 --> 34:51.449
It was really good.

34:53.085 --> 34:54.385
It was really good, huh?

34:55.297 --> 34:56.449
What do you think, Neil?

34:56.449 --> 34:58.780
Was it really good?

34:59.810 --> 35:02.470
Yeah Neil, was it really good?

35:03.700 --> 35:05.000
Yes, it was really nice.

35:07.764 --> 35:08.847
It was great.

35:10.140 --> 35:11.800
You saw it already?

35:14.050 --> 35:15.390
Yeah, I saw it earlier.

35:17.934 --> 35:19.184

Three for me.

36:54.666 --> 36:56.940
Damn, these look good.

36:58.715 --> 36:59.548
I thought I'd be embarrassed

36:59.549 --> 37:02.229
about this but they are amazing.

37:02.230 --> 37:04.090
I'm actually kinda proud of this.

37:05.750 --> 37:07.580
Am I really,

37:08.460 --> 37:09.630
am I really this hot?

37:10.798 --> 37:11.881
Yes.
Yeah.

37:13.862 --> 37:16.199
Are you kidding me?
You're kidding me, right?

37:16.200 --> 37:17.859
What?

37:17.860 --> 37:20.609
Have you seen this?
Of course I've seen it.

37:20.610 --> 37:22.523
Are you fuckin' stupid?

37:22.524 --> 37:25.059
I still don't understand
what you're upset about.

37:25.060 --> 37:27.359
This is pornography, you moron.

37:27.360 --> 37:29.740
This ain't sexy, it's porn.

37:30.680 --> 37:33.190
It's classy porn, some
people consider it art.

37:36.400 --> 37:39.099
You know, this is not sexy, okay?

37:39.100 --> 37:41.759
Sexy is Sports Illustrated.

37:41.760 --> 37:44.919
A girl with no shirt on with
her hands over her tits...

37:44.920 --> 37:47.089
Look, you already promised
that girl, all right?

37:47.090 --> 37:48.419
She's trying to save her sick kid.

37:48.420 --> 37:51.139
Look at this man, we
can't sell this on property.

37:51.140 --> 37:52.090
Why not?

37:52.970 --> 37:53.979
What about the gaming commission?

37:53.980 --> 37:55.469
Gaming is not gonna care about this.

37:55.470 --> 37:57.059
Why would they give a shit about this?

37:57.060 --> 37:58.089
They cared about the billboards

37:58.090 --> 37:59.929
from the Hard Rock, didn't they?

37:59.930 --> 38:02.049
They got fined $300,000.
Wait a second.

38:02.050 --> 38:03.839
Playboy has done shoots at the Hard Rock

38:03.840 --> 38:06.284
and at the Palms, how is
that any different than this?

38:06.285 --> 38:08.669
They should've been more
clear about their content.

38:08.670 --> 38:11.389
It was pretty obvious.
It wasn't obvious to me.

38:11.390 --> 38:13.159
We wouldn't be having this
conversation, would we?

38:13.160 --> 38:14.510
It was obvious.

38:17.170 --> 38:19.659
You want to get clearance
from the gaming commission?

38:19.660 --> 38:21.229
Is that what you need,
you want me to call gaming?

38:21.230 --> 38:23.329
I'll take care of it.
Go ahead.

38:23.330 --> 38:24.680
Get me an answer by Friday.

38:26.340 --> 38:27.945
Go ahead, have at it.

38:27.946 --> 38:29.659
I'll be god damned if
I'm gonna pay a fine

38:29.660 --> 38:30.949
for something that I'm not even making

38:30.950 --> 38:32.589
any money off of in the first place.

38:32.590 --> 38:34.469
This weekend's gonna be huge,
everybody's gonna be here.

38:34.470 --> 38:36.669
These things are gonna sell
like fuckin' hot cakes.

38:36.670 --> 38:37.503
I don't care.

38:39.456 --> 38:40.709
The kid's fuckin' sick.

38:40.710 --> 38:42.190
Oh, you're gonna bring up the kid, now?

38:43.180 --> 38:46.640
It's not about that,
Carter, it's about business.

38:47.600 --> 38:49.900
It's a business thing,
just man up about that.

38:54.159 --> 38:57.339
How could he do this,
what kind of a man is he?

38:57.340 --> 39:00.219
He is not a man, just a piece of shit.

39:00.220 --> 39:01.729
I don't know what to do.

39:01.730 --> 39:04.649
We spent 15,000 on these
calendars and are

39:04.650 --> 39:08.609
almost broke and we're
running out of time.

39:08.610 --> 39:10.339
How much time do we have?

39:10.340 --> 39:12.840
We're gonna do the final test on Monday

39:12.841 --> 39:14.509
and then do chemo right away.

39:14.510 --> 39:16.499
Why can't you just have
them do the procedure

39:16.500 --> 39:19.669
and then avoid the bill.
What are they gonna do?

39:19.670 --> 39:22.469
They can't take it back.
Let them sue you.

39:22.470 --> 39:23.689
I'd do that in a heartbeat, but

39:23.690 --> 39:26.039
most of the costs are due up front.

39:26.040 --> 39:27.799
I'm sure they're on to that game.

39:27.800 --> 39:29.589
It's not over yet. There is

39:29.590 --> 39:31.509
another option I was thinking of.

39:31.510 --> 39:32.709
We're listening.

39:32.710 --> 39:35.629
The way I see it,
Dean Belding has fucked

39:35.630 --> 39:38.110
over Kora every way
possible on this one.

39:38.967 --> 39:39.880
So...
So,

39:39.881 --> 39:43.269
he's no longer entitled to
our trust or our loyalty.

39:43.270 --> 39:44.730
I like where this is going.

39:46.030 --> 39:48.129
Where exactly is this going?

39:48.130 --> 39:50.819
Let's just take the
money we need for Josh.

39:50.820 --> 39:52.839
How?
Don't tell me you all

39:52.840 --> 39:55.419
haven't thought of ways
to scam the casino.

39:55.420 --> 39:59.819
I mean, standing there hour
after hour on a dead game.

39:59.820 --> 40:03.379
We have to brainstorm and then
just go with our best idea.

40:03.380 --> 40:04.719
Yeah, but we're talking
a lot of money here.

40:04.720 --> 40:08.059
It's not like slipping a
yellow chip out of your game.

40:08.060 --> 40:10.859
I mean we can probably
get a few thousand out

40:10.860 --> 40:15.926
without anyone noticing,
but we're talking 200 grand.

40:15.950 --> 40:17.759
I don't think it's possible.

40:17.760 --> 40:20.349
I think you're selling
us all a bit short.

40:20.350 --> 40:22.179
I agree. Let's talk it through

40:22.180 --> 40:24.179
and see what we come up with.

40:24.180 --> 40:25.529
At least consider it.

40:25.530 --> 40:28.470
That is assuming we're
all okay with this.

40:29.510 --> 40:31.599
This is big time you guys.

40:31.600 --> 40:34.359
This isn't just our jobs
we're talking about.

40:34.360 --> 40:36.940
This goes wrong at it
could be jail time.

40:38.020 --> 40:40.710
Fuck it, I'm in. Whatever it takes.

40:41.950 --> 40:43.519
Sure.

40:43.520 --> 40:45.669
I'm obviously okay with it.

40:45.670 --> 40:50.349
I'm open to it, but we
have to be really careful.

40:50.350 --> 40:53.709
We have to be real sure this
is something we can pull off.

40:53.710 --> 40:55.979
Oh my god guys, I can't have you guys

40:55.980 --> 40:58.409
put your asses on the line for me.

40:58.410 --> 41:01.229
You know I'd never ask
you if it was just for me.

41:01.230 --> 41:03.269
But I don't know what else to do here.

41:03.270 --> 41:04.669
Let's get some paper and think this

41:04.670 --> 41:06.920
thing through and see
if it even makes sense.

41:16.433 --> 41:19.850
Hey Dean, I handled that thing for you.

41:27.390 --> 41:30.006
Anyone not like the roulette scam?

41:30.007 --> 41:32.307
It sounds good if
Madison can make it first.

41:33.154 --> 41:37.129
So we like this one and the craps one.

41:37.130 --> 41:39.229
That one's absolutely brilliant.

41:39.230 --> 41:41.749
How much seed money are
we gonna need for this?

41:41.750 --> 41:43.799
Well we're gonna need an agent,

41:43.800 --> 41:46.989
somebody pretending to
be like a lucky winner

41:46.990 --> 41:49.839
that nobody in the casino knows.

41:49.840 --> 41:52.629
I think I got the
seed money figured out.

41:52.630 --> 41:56.339
Now, this will be taking
things to a different level

41:56.340 --> 41:59.649
but I think I can get my hands
on some counterfeit money.

41:59.650 --> 42:01.809
That's serious stuff, Aero.

42:01.810 --> 42:04.409
That's a bigger deal than
just scamming the casino.

42:04.410 --> 42:07.689
Yeah but it gets us to where
we need to be a lot faster.

42:07.690 --> 42:10.199
Besides, if we're the
ones taking in the cash,

42:10.200 --> 42:11.729
there isn't much of a
chance of it getting

42:11.730 --> 42:13.859
noticed until the morning
when they do the count.

42:13.860 --> 42:14.959
That's true.

42:14.960 --> 42:16.629
And how do we answer for all the phony

42:16.630 --> 42:19.329
money when they've found
out they've been scammed?

42:19.330 --> 42:22.759
Oh wait, this is good, we don't.

42:22.760 --> 42:23.989
Whoever we're working with,

42:23.990 --> 42:27.169
this agent, spreads it
around to all of us.

42:27.170 --> 42:28.819
That way when they ask us what happened,

42:28.820 --> 42:30.779
we can plead ignorance.

42:30.780 --> 42:33.039
No one's gonna suspect any one of us

42:33.040 --> 42:35.599
if all the dealers in
the pit got fooled.

42:35.600 --> 42:36.969
The money just has to be good

42:36.970 --> 42:38.760
enough to pass a casual glance.

42:39.690 --> 42:40.859
Yeah.

42:40.860 --> 42:43.199
Where are you getting the money?

42:43.200 --> 42:45.180
The less you guys know, the better.

42:46.020 --> 42:47.610
So we still need an agent.

42:48.610 --> 42:50.260
I think I got that one covered.

42:51.208 --> 42:52.041
Who?

42:52.042 --> 42:53.509
No one any of you know.

42:53.510 --> 42:55.429
He's never stepped foot in

42:55.430 --> 42:57.019
the casino before, so he's perfect.

42:57.020 --> 42:59.559
Let me feel him out and
I'll get back to you guys.

42:59.560 --> 43:00.959
And if we do the craps,

43:00.960 --> 43:03.159
we have to work around our assignments.

43:03.160 --> 43:04.689
We have to make sure that three of us

43:04.690 --> 43:06.769
are running the games at all times

43:06.770 --> 43:09.929
and whoever is sitting box,
they have to be in on it, too.

43:09.930 --> 43:11.309
Celeste will do it.

43:11.310 --> 43:12.260
We definitely need one of

43:12.261 --> 43:14.634
the four supervisors in on it, too.

43:14.635 --> 43:17.109
More people, really?

43:17.110 --> 43:19.169
It's okay. We just have to get

43:19.170 --> 43:21.159
through the night and we'll be fine.

43:21.160 --> 43:22.829
If anybody talks after that, the worst

43:22.830 --> 43:25.279
that happens is that
some of us lose our jobs.

43:25.280 --> 43:27.085
How do you figure?

43:27.086 --> 43:31.729
If anybody finds out,
what do they really have?

43:31.730 --> 43:33.929
A really good story, but no proof.

43:33.930 --> 43:36.459
If anybody asks us, we just deny

43:36.460 --> 43:39.119
everything and they have nothing on us.

43:39.120 --> 43:41.399
So we just have to make
it through the caper.

43:41.400 --> 43:42.280
Yep.

43:42.281 --> 43:46.789
So, which floor
person, Paige or Natalie?

43:46.790 --> 43:49.789
I think I trust Natalie before Paige.

43:49.790 --> 43:50.630
I second that.

43:50.631 --> 43:52.479
So I'll get Celeste and Natalie

43:52.480 --> 43:54.659
on board. Leave that to me.

43:54.660 --> 43:57.660
And I'll get my brother to
help us with the roulette scam.

44:12.880 --> 44:13.713
Hey sis.

44:14.690 --> 44:16.090
Hey, baby bro. How are you?

44:17.310 --> 44:19.860
Apparently I'm an accomplice
to a pending felony.

44:24.340 --> 44:26.609
Now, here's the ball, back but you have

44:26.610 --> 44:28.769
to test this on an
actual wheel somewhere.

44:28.770 --> 44:30.059
From what I can tell,
it should work fine

44:30.060 --> 44:31.529
and the mixture won't
transfer to the ball

44:31.530 --> 44:33.069
from the tests I ran, but you have to

44:33.070 --> 44:35.130
use this in a real-world environment.

44:36.117 --> 44:37.869
Okay, of course I will.

44:37.870 --> 44:40.670
And you never thought I'd
use my chemistry degree.

44:40.671 --> 44:43.269
You are a used car salesman, baby bro.

44:43.270 --> 44:46.249
Yeah, well not every car
salesman can do what you

44:46.250 --> 44:49.159
need and want to be part of
your little crime syndicate.

44:49.160 --> 44:50.860
No crime has been committed yet.

44:51.990 --> 44:54.699
Last I checked, conspiracy is a crime.

44:54.700 --> 44:55.870
Smart ass.

44:57.940 --> 45:00.099
Thanks for helping. I
have to get to work.

45:00.100 --> 45:02.169
Yeah, let me know if you
need any more help on this

45:02.170 --> 45:04.669
because I hear prison has better
cable TV than my apartment.

45:04.670 --> 45:06.150
So it's a win-win for me.

45:15.082 --> 45:19.859
How am I ever gonna
get laid if I get busted?

45:19.860 --> 45:20.693
Hey.
Hey.

45:21.838 --> 45:24.010
Hello.
So, what do you say?

45:27.300 --> 45:29.380
Oh, I already told her, I'm in.

45:32.160 --> 45:34.049
Okay, here's the deal,

45:34.050 --> 45:36.129
I won't see or say anything that night.

45:36.130 --> 45:38.819
You do whatever you want,
keep it under the radar

45:38.820 --> 45:41.659
and I'll play dumb and if
something happens that's

45:41.660 --> 45:44.980
so blatant that I can't ignore
it, I won't notice a thing.

45:46.310 --> 45:48.029
Now, I don't want any money. I don't

45:48.030 --> 45:50.719
want to speak to anyone else about this

45:50.720 --> 45:52.889
and if anyone so much as mentions it,

45:52.890 --> 45:54.740
I'll have no idea what
they're talking about

45:55.808 --> 45:58.997
and I never want this to
be brought up again, okay?

45:58.998 --> 45:59.831
Okay.

46:02.080 --> 46:03.470
Thank you, Natalie.

46:05.630 --> 46:08.179
Maybe we can just use
her share to hire someone

46:08.180 --> 46:10.430
to remove the telephone
pole from up her ass.

46:12.080 --> 46:15.980
Make her a Facebook, get her
some friends, I don't know.

46:17.070 --> 46:20.070
Ladies, I'll have the
funny money on Tuesday.

46:22.840 --> 46:24.939
And you're not gonna tell
us where you're gettin' it?

46:24.940 --> 46:26.699
No, that's part of the deal.

46:26.700 --> 46:29.159
See, he doesn't know what I need it for

46:29.160 --> 46:32.149
and I promised to never
tell anyone where I get it.

46:32.150 --> 46:33.289
How much are you getting?

46:33.290 --> 46:37.539
Well he's getting us 300
grand at 10 cents on the dollar.

46:37.540 --> 46:39.289
I don't have that much left.

46:39.290 --> 46:42.869
After the calendars, I'm
down to about seven grand.

46:42.870 --> 46:45.179
Well, just give me that
and I'll cover the rest.

46:45.180 --> 46:47.199
I'll just have to take
it out of the proceed

46:47.200 --> 46:50.469
to get even if we end up
with more than Josh needs.

46:50.470 --> 46:53.209
Maybe it's a little late to
bring this up, but if we have

46:53.210 --> 46:56.969
all that fake cash, why do we
even have to run the scams?

46:56.970 --> 47:00.549
Let's just work the money
through, cash in the chips.

47:00.550 --> 47:04.089
So you think that our
guy is just gonna walk in,

47:04.090 --> 47:09.096
lay down 300 grand in cash,
be given 300 grand in chips,

47:09.120 --> 47:12.241
go right to the cage and then
be given his cash back and

47:12.242 --> 47:15.406
you don't think that would be
just a tiny bit suspicious?

47:15.407 --> 47:17.079
Yeah, I suppose.

47:17.080 --> 47:19.319
He has to play at
least for a little bit.

47:19.320 --> 47:22.749
We cannot leave his winning
and losing to chance.

47:22.750 --> 47:24.969
I mean our asses are
really on the line already

47:24.970 --> 47:28.119
with this one, counterfeiting
being the big one.

47:28.120 --> 47:30.079
I mean, after all that,

47:30.080 --> 47:32.609
a little cheating is
hardly worth mentioning.

47:32.610 --> 47:33.899
Yeah, I guess you don't worry

47:33.900 --> 47:35.890
about speeding after robbing a bank.

47:39.380 --> 47:42.019
Madison, are you still
set on the roulette scam?

47:42.020 --> 47:44.219
I think so.
Have you tested it?

47:44.220 --> 47:46.639
I mean, on an actual wheel?

47:46.640 --> 47:48.940
Not yet, that's why
we need to get in a lab.

47:50.770 --> 47:51.730
And your mystery man's

47:51.731 --> 47:54.149
gonna have to come to the dry run.

47:54.150 --> 47:57.029
He'll be there. What about Celeste?

47:57.030 --> 47:58.109
She'll be there.

47:58.110 --> 48:00.239
Okay, so looks like we've
got the wheel and the dice all

48:00.240 --> 48:03.140
set up, but we still don't have
anything for the blackjack.

48:04.370 --> 48:06.320
Anyone come up with anything on that?

48:10.660 --> 48:13.239
Maybe we should just
run the 21 straight,

48:13.240 --> 48:16.109
cycle through the fake bills
in between the bigger scams.

48:16.110 --> 48:17.769
As long as the bills are realistic,

48:17.770 --> 48:20.199
our guy walks in there
with a wad of cash,

48:20.200 --> 48:23.819
he occasionally throws
down five grand for a hand,

48:23.820 --> 48:26.369
he wins, we're golden
and then he just splits

48:26.370 --> 48:28.709
it up so that the blame
is shared by all of us.

48:28.710 --> 48:31.059
Your guy's gonna need a fake ID, too.

48:31.060 --> 48:33.469
Once he's in 10 grand
in cash, they'll have

48:33.470 --> 48:37.429
to take his info to file
a form 8300 for the Feds.

48:37.430 --> 48:38.969
Yeah, he's already on that.

48:38.970 --> 48:41.509
Sounds like everything
is covered so far.

48:41.510 --> 48:45.039
There is one other issue
I found, but I have a fix.

48:45.040 --> 48:47.119
I have to clean out the
wheel when we're done.

48:47.120 --> 48:48.369
Clean it?

48:48.370 --> 48:50.039
Well if the trick works, I have to get

48:50.040 --> 48:51.709
the adhesive outta
there when we're done.

48:51.710 --> 48:53.729
If they keep repeating all night,

48:53.730 --> 48:55.789
eyebrows are definitely
gonna raise and what if

48:55.790 --> 48:58.069
they suspect something and
run tests on the wheel?

48:58.070 --> 49:01.439
I have to clean it out.
That sounds unlikely.

49:01.440 --> 49:03.459
We need to be sure, so just in case they

49:03.460 --> 49:05.569
test the wheel, there
won't be any evidence.

49:05.570 --> 49:07.249
Then even if there is suspicion,

49:07.250 --> 49:08.919
there's nothing hard to tie it to me.

49:08.920 --> 49:11.032
So you have to get the adhesive

49:11.033 --> 49:13.009
in somehow and they get it out again,

49:13.010 --> 49:16.779
with all those cameras on us?
I've got it figured out.

49:16.780 --> 49:18.150
But we need another agent.

49:19.240 --> 49:21.659
It's okay, we're gonna
use my baby brother.

49:21.660 --> 49:24.489
We are?
We know we can trust him.

49:24.490 --> 49:27.449
Another agent? Is that
absolutely necessary?

49:27.450 --> 49:30.650
It is, but I've thought of
another way he can help us.

49:31.770 --> 49:32.850
We're all ears.

49:43.430 --> 49:45.030
Where do you think you're going?

49:46.490 --> 49:48.662
Nowhere.
Good.

49:49.390 --> 49:50.681
Have a seat.

49:51.310 --> 49:53.198
You know who I am, don't you?

49:53.199 --> 49:54.518
Sure.

49:54.519 --> 49:56.770
Yeah, well the trouble is,
I don't know who you are.

49:58.740 --> 49:59.580
Um... Nadia.

50:01.430 --> 50:04.360
I know you're a working girl,

50:06.100 --> 50:07.340
independent contractor.

50:08.470 --> 50:10.210
I know you're just making a living.

50:12.556 --> 50:13.930
That's fine with me.

50:15.140 --> 50:16.809
Except, I don't think you have

50:16.810 --> 50:18.610
permission to work this property.

50:21.500 --> 50:24.079
How do I get permission?

50:24.080 --> 50:25.949
Well, as luck would have it, you came to

50:25.950 --> 50:28.500
the right place 'cause I'm
just the guy to do that.

50:30.060 --> 50:33.329
All you have to do is come upstairs to

50:33.330 --> 50:35.720
my office and fill out
the proper paperwork

50:36.720 --> 50:38.820
and then I'll make sure
that you don't get

50:40.430 --> 50:43.510
removed from the premises.
Yeah.

50:44.376 --> 50:46.061
Yeah?
Sure.

50:46.062 --> 50:47.410
Let's go. It's that way.

50:51.610 --> 50:52.610
Okay, it's me.

50:53.900 --> 50:55.099
No, you can't do that.

50:55.100 --> 50:58.049
You can only go in the
direction of the black arrow

50:58.050 --> 51:00.679
and there's a fire vampire
blocking you anyway.

51:00.680 --> 51:02.659
This is way too complicated.

51:02.660 --> 51:04.779
I'm eight and I understand it.

51:04.780 --> 51:07.380
I think you're supposed
to be smarter than me.

51:08.280 --> 51:09.899
Keep it up.

51:09.900 --> 51:11.300
Are you getting any of this?

51:12.470 --> 51:13.870
It's probably a guy thing.

51:15.940 --> 51:19.550
Okay, what am I supposed to do, then?

51:23.260 --> 51:24.093
33.

51:28.740 --> 51:31.010
Hey, guys.
Hey, what's going on?

51:33.910 --> 51:35.480
This is Celeste.
Hey.

51:36.640 --> 51:38.889
Looks like we're just
waiting on Raine and our

51:38.890 --> 51:41.839
mystery man and we'll be
able to start the dry run.

51:41.840 --> 51:43.799
Yeah, I think they were
just parking right behind us.

51:43.800 --> 51:45.079
Unless it's Dean's spies coming

51:45.080 --> 51:46.880
to kill us before we rob his casino.

51:47.880 --> 51:48.740
Toby.

51:49.770 --> 51:51.009
Sorry.

51:51.010 --> 51:52.819
Anyways, Toby and I have figured out

51:52.820 --> 51:54.149
a way to clear out the wheel, but we're

51:54.150 --> 51:56.259
gonna need somebody to help him do it.

51:56.260 --> 51:57.629
You guys, this is crazy.

51:57.630 --> 52:00.129
There's already way too
many people in on this.

52:00.130 --> 52:03.049
It's okay 'cause whoever
helps, they won't know what's up.

52:03.050 --> 52:04.609
Do you give us your word on that?

52:04.610 --> 52:07.079
You'll tell no one?
Absolutely.

52:07.080 --> 52:09.559
Besides, no need, I can
pull this off by myself.

52:09.560 --> 52:11.639
I just need someone
else to help me sell it.

52:11.640 --> 52:13.889
Yeah, he's gonna run
blocker for us, too.

52:13.890 --> 52:17.599
Someone to be a distraction.
Okay.

52:17.600 --> 52:18.759
Yeah and we're gonna give him about

52:18.760 --> 52:21.159
10 grand in the funny
money to play with.

52:21.160 --> 52:22.020
Of course I'll give you guys

52:22.021 --> 52:23.669
whatever I win when it's over.

52:23.670 --> 52:26.679
I'm gonna show up
with a hottie on my arm

52:26.680 --> 52:28.079
and as much as you expect a guy like me

52:28.080 --> 52:30.159
to show up with a smokin'
babe on his arm,

52:30.160 --> 52:32.719
it'll help sell it if I
have a little bit of money.

52:32.720 --> 52:34.519
Who's this hottie of yours?

52:34.520 --> 52:35.809
Hey, all the ladies are

52:35.810 --> 52:38.179
lining up to ride the Toby express.

52:38.180 --> 52:39.449
Yeah, except it's one of those

52:39.450 --> 52:41.939
rides that make a lot of people sick.

52:41.940 --> 52:44.529
Well, you must be one
tough chick then, because

52:44.530 --> 52:47.030
once you got off, you
couldn't wait to ride again.

52:50.570 --> 52:53.089
Hey.
Hey.

52:53.090 --> 52:55.580
This is our secret weapon. Meet Jimmy.

52:56.592 --> 52:58.377
Hi.
Hey.

52:58.378 --> 52:59.545
Hey.

53:01.750 --> 53:03.050
33.
Good.

53:04.310 --> 53:06.229
Okay, so that's spin number 18.

53:06.230 --> 53:09.279
We've rigged 4 out of 38 numbers which

53:09.280 --> 53:12.379
averages to about one
hit every nine spins.

53:12.380 --> 53:15.929
So, statistically we should
have two or three hits.

53:15.930 --> 53:18.490
So how many hits do we get?
Eight.

53:19.620 --> 53:22.219
How do we know it wasn't just luck?

53:22.220 --> 53:24.779
We've been doing this the
past two days, it's good.

53:24.780 --> 53:27.949
But is it too good? Will
we be hitting too often?

53:27.950 --> 53:30.549
Not if we keep it short and sweet.

53:30.550 --> 53:31.949
You're gonna have to
follow my lead on this.

53:31.950 --> 53:33.569
My ass is on the line big time

53:33.570 --> 53:35.049
and I don't wanna push our luck.

53:35.050 --> 53:37.476
When I say it's over, it's over.

53:37.477 --> 53:38.593
You're the boss.

53:38.594 --> 53:40.779
You guys ready to do
a dry run on the dice?

53:40.780 --> 53:42.980
We really need to get
that one down cold.

53:44.090 --> 53:44.923
Let's do it.

53:46.570 --> 53:49.199
Do we all know the game?
Not me so much.

53:49.200 --> 53:52.339
Not really. It was always
too fast and loud for me.

53:52.340 --> 53:54.499
Exactly, the advantage we have

53:54.500 --> 53:56.349
is that it's a fast moving game.

53:56.350 --> 53:59.089
It's always packed, especially
on Fridays and Saturdays.

53:59.090 --> 54:02.009
It'll be especially
slamming on Pajama Weekend.

54:02.010 --> 54:03.929
Our angle works because
the dice table is

54:03.930 --> 54:06.607
the only table in town
that allows call bets.

54:06.608 --> 54:07.759
Betting without putting
money on the table.

54:07.760 --> 54:10.149
Well, money or chips are
usually placed on the table.

54:10.150 --> 54:12.949
They're just not necessarily
placed in the right place.

54:12.950 --> 54:15.059
A lot of bets go down
at the very last second,

54:15.060 --> 54:16.859
right before the dice are thrown.

54:16.860 --> 54:19.729
A player can put down a
stack of chips or money

54:19.730 --> 54:22.519
and make a bet and the dealer
can confirm it verbally,

54:22.520 --> 54:25.309
even if the bet isn't
in the right place.

54:25.310 --> 54:27.329
I'm not following you.

54:27.330 --> 54:30.249
We'll show you. Celeste
is our big roller.

54:30.250 --> 54:31.900
Celeste, place your bets.

54:33.190 --> 54:35.609
Come-out roll, craps, 11, any 7.

54:35.610 --> 54:38.129
Place your bets. Dice are moving.

54:38.130 --> 54:39.999
2,000 on the hop.
It's a bet.

54:40.000 --> 54:43.149
Dice are out, dice
away! Eight, easy eight!

54:43.150 --> 54:45.779
Winner on the hop, three-five!

54:45.780 --> 54:47.059
That's it.

54:47.060 --> 54:49.779
I have no idea what just happened.

54:49.780 --> 54:51.209
I'm playing Jimmy's role.

54:51.210 --> 54:52.999
I placed what's called a hopping bet.

54:53.000 --> 54:54.589
It's a bet where I can call the exact

54:54.590 --> 54:57.579
dice combination right
before the next roll.

54:57.580 --> 54:59.139
That's right and Celeste just

54:59.140 --> 55:02.619
called 2,000 on the hop, three-five.

55:02.620 --> 55:04.529
I didn't hear her
say any numbers at all.

55:04.530 --> 55:07.859
Exactly, but I did and
you did too, right Lex?

55:07.860 --> 55:09.849
Sure, clear as a bell.

55:09.850 --> 55:11.689
And I'll be the supervisor on shift.

55:11.690 --> 55:13.859
Lexie, Raine and Aero
will be the dealers

55:13.860 --> 55:17.089
and I can assure you ever single
one of us heard three-five.

55:17.090 --> 55:18.579
What about the other players?

55:18.580 --> 55:20.299
As long as our timing is down,

55:20.300 --> 55:23.259
nobody's gonna know
what Jimmy really says.

55:23.260 --> 55:27.445
It's gonna be a loud, crazy
mess of a game. It always is.

55:27.446 --> 55:29.609
That just sounds a little too easy.

55:29.610 --> 55:33.289
It sounds easy but our
timing has to be spot on.

55:33.290 --> 55:36.999
More importantly, Jimmy and
Toby's timing have to be spot on

55:37.000 --> 55:39.129
because Toby's gonna be
the one to make sure that

55:39.130 --> 55:41.870
no one hears what numbers
are really being called.

55:42.790 --> 55:44.669
Or not called.

55:44.670 --> 55:46.909
We do have to have
a few losers in there.

55:46.910 --> 55:51.149
It's 15-to-one odds, so
one in three makes sense.

55:51.150 --> 55:52.869
We can lose two grand a couple

55:52.870 --> 55:55.069
of times and then we hit for 30.

55:55.070 --> 55:56.769
We just have to watch for Paige

55:56.770 --> 55:59.089
and for the big boys
like Carter and Sal.

55:59.090 --> 56:00.060
If they're hawking the game,

56:00.061 --> 56:02.169
then we just play it
straight for those rolls

56:02.170 --> 56:05.709
and eye in the sky, well
they don't have audio.

56:05.710 --> 56:08.039
Everything they see seems legit.

56:08.040 --> 56:09.339
Now, we'll be rotating our breaks,

56:09.340 --> 56:11.809
so we only have 20
minutes out of every hour.

56:11.810 --> 56:14.259
We'll find out when the
breaks are and fill you in.

56:14.260 --> 56:15.439
When you come to the table,

56:15.440 --> 56:17.889
play for a few minutes and then move on.

56:17.890 --> 56:19.779
If you come back and we're still going,

56:19.780 --> 56:22.339
then go for another
quick second go-around.

56:22.340 --> 56:25.139
Yeah, Lexie likes those quick seconds.

56:25.140 --> 56:27.429
What are you saying, bitch?

56:27.430 --> 56:30.239
There's nothing wrong with
being a slut if you love it.

56:30.240 --> 56:33.569
You're one to talk.
What's this?

56:33.570 --> 56:36.549
Oh nothing, it's just one of the guys at

56:36.550 --> 56:39.239
work has been exercising
at the gym of Kora,

56:39.240 --> 56:41.149
open 24-7 and you don't even have

56:41.150 --> 56:43.229
to towel off the equipment
when you're done.

56:43.230 --> 56:45.079
That's nice.

56:45.080 --> 56:47.309
Let's hear it, Lexie.

56:47.310 --> 56:49.109
How about, no?

56:49.110 --> 56:52.139
Sorry girls, I can say no more.

56:52.140 --> 56:54.719
Thank you for respecting my new friend.

56:54.720 --> 56:57.139
I thought he was just a sex buddy.

56:57.140 --> 57:00.110
It's more like
do-me-in-my-tight-little-booty buddy.

57:01.090 --> 57:03.069
Always the lady, huh?

57:03.070 --> 57:06.349
Hey, I'm not the one who
likes it in the booty, okay?

57:06.350 --> 57:08.219
Oh, my god.
Are you two gonna make out?

57:08.220 --> 57:09.090
Toby.
What?

57:09.091 --> 57:11.449
Maybe we should practice this thing.

57:11.450 --> 57:13.100
I'd rather watch them make out.

57:14.902 --> 57:15.735
Ow.

57:21.930 --> 57:24.319
Wow, they don't
suspect a thing, do they?

57:24.320 --> 57:25.749
Not a clue.

57:25.750 --> 57:28.229
You were right on in there.
Thanks.

57:28.230 --> 57:29.530
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

57:50.450 --> 57:51.949
Hey, Kora.
Hey.

57:51.950 --> 57:53.319
How's Josh?

57:53.320 --> 57:54.919
He still seems fine, but

57:54.920 --> 57:57.299
I gotta get this under control soon.

57:57.300 --> 57:59.117
The clock's ticking.
Yeah.

57:59.118 --> 58:01.379
I'm sorry about the
whole calendar thing.

58:01.380 --> 58:04.489
I tried to get Dean to bend
on it but, I don't know.

58:04.490 --> 58:05.588
I know you did.

58:06.470 --> 58:08.849
Look, I know it's kinda last minute, but

58:08.850 --> 58:11.179
can I get back on
schedule for this weekend?

58:11.180 --> 58:14.288
With the party, I just don't
wanna lose out on those tips.

58:14.289 --> 58:16.079
Yeah, you want all three days?

58:16.080 --> 58:17.929
That would be great.
All right.

58:17.930 --> 58:19.599
I'll make sure Natalie knows about it.

58:19.600 --> 58:20.433
Thanks.

58:33.500 --> 58:37.779
So, what specifically
are you looking for?

58:37.780 --> 58:40.890
This! I've been looking
for this my whole life.

58:41.800 --> 58:44.729
I'm gonna need two,
better make that three

58:44.730 --> 58:47.439
really got girls to make
me look like a big shot.

58:47.440 --> 58:48.740
What do they have to do?

58:49.890 --> 58:50.723
Look hot.

58:51.850 --> 58:52.683
Of course.

58:55.020 --> 58:56.720
Do you represent any porn stars?

59:10.310 --> 59:11.143
Hey.

59:16.753 --> 59:17.969
How you doing, beautiful?

59:17.970 --> 59:20.769
I still have a hard time
imagining you in a kitchen,

59:20.770 --> 59:23.899
except maybe one in a prison.

59:23.900 --> 59:27.599
Hey, I finally found something
I'm good at, all right?

59:27.600 --> 59:29.129
And it's legal.

59:29.130 --> 59:31.679
They must keep you way
out of sight of the diners.

59:31.680 --> 59:33.169
I haven't eaten in hours and just

59:33.170 --> 59:35.110
looking at you turns my stomach.

59:37.900 --> 59:39.159
Do guys let you get away with being

59:39.160 --> 59:42.419
such a smart ass 'cause
you're so fucking cute?

59:42.420 --> 59:44.320
I'm a smart ass with a pile of money.

59:45.300 --> 59:46.133
If you want it.

59:55.350 --> 59:56.490
300?
Yep.

01:00:11.710 --> 01:00:14.799
God damn Sid, very nice.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:17.149
I wouldn't even look twice at these.

01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:18.780
Well, that was the deal, right?

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:23.559
I think the watermark is a bit off.

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:27.340
But they're really close.
The watermark is fine.

01:00:28.965 --> 01:00:30.599
I thought this was
supposed to be Ben Franklin.

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:32.819
It looks more like Aretha Franklin.

01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:34.419
Fine, don't take them.

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:36.470
I know plenty of guys who will.

01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:41.900
I'm just fuckin' with ya. I want 'em.

01:00:47.450 --> 01:00:49.930
30?
That was the deal.

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:54.320
That was part of the deal.

01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:56.913
Seriously?

01:00:58.290 --> 01:00:59.299
My fucking fingers weren't

01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:01.150
crossed if that's what you're asking.

01:01:02.370 --> 01:01:03.203
Fine.

01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:07.209
Oh, come on.
What?

01:01:07.210 --> 01:01:09.209
I asked for a good look.

01:01:09.210 --> 01:01:10.910
I blinked and I fuckin' missed it.

01:01:12.810 --> 01:01:14.170
You are such a child.

01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:19.689
Ooh, there's nothing childish about

01:01:19.690 --> 01:01:22.920
a man appreciating a nice
pair of tits like that.

01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:24.790
In fact,

01:01:25.930 --> 01:01:28.579
it's timeless.
Are we done now?

01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:29.789
Well, if you're asking me if I'm bored,

01:01:29.790 --> 01:01:31.590
you're years away from hearing 'yes'.

01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:34.550
Okay, well thanks for the money

01:01:35.762 --> 01:01:38.980
and the creepy pervert vibe.
Hey.

01:01:40.090 --> 01:01:41.690
You wanna stick around and fuck?

01:01:47.743 --> 01:01:49.349
You know,

01:01:49.350 --> 01:01:53.610
I was actually very, very
horny when I got here.

01:01:55.770 --> 01:01:57.309
But then you totally killed it

01:01:57.310 --> 01:01:59.619
with that dirty old man stare.

01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:02.089
Instead of having a
look at the mountains,

01:02:02.090 --> 01:02:04.600
you could've dined in the valley.

01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:08.410
Fucking blew that one, didn't you?

01:02:11.650 --> 01:02:12.780
So is that 'no'?

01:02:19.427 --> 01:02:21.307
You work on reservations up there, or?

01:02:21.308 --> 01:02:22.382
Some Indian reservations,

01:02:22.383 --> 01:02:24.210
I've been down in Atlantic City as well.

01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:30.649
Just leave me a contact. I'll make sure

01:02:30.650 --> 01:02:32.559
I call you and we'll see
if we can get you in here.

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:35.260
I have a business card.
That's fine, that's fine.

01:02:36.664 --> 01:02:38.339
I hope you guys have some openings.

01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:41.029
Yeah, as you can see, it's
a pretty rough business.

01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:42.030
Hey.
Hi, Carter.

01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:43.910
Hello girls.

01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:14.429
Can I get you to
autograph this for me, Ms. Kora?

01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:15.979
Sir, you can't put this on the table.

01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:18.019
It's blocking the action
from surveillance.

01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:19.180
Oh, okay, sorry.

01:03:20.610 --> 01:03:21.810
Hey, you're in this, too.

01:03:22.651 --> 01:03:24.451
Can I get your autograph after hers?

01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:28.749
I guess it's fine but she
can't do it while we're working.

01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:30.349
You'll have to wait
until she goes on break.

01:03:30.350 --> 01:03:32.209
Yeah, sure.

01:03:32.210 --> 01:03:33.390
I understand.

01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:36.009
You, too?

01:03:36.010 --> 01:03:37.900
Sure, when I go on break.

01:03:39.768 --> 01:03:41.929
Wow, looks like it's gonna
be an interesting evening.

01:03:41.930 --> 01:03:43.869
Yeah, no kidding.

01:03:43.870 --> 01:03:45.683
You guys ready to have a good time?

01:03:45.684 --> 01:03:48.601
Oh yeah, I'm ready man, let's go.

01:03:49.781 --> 01:03:50.614
Let me know
if you need anything.

01:03:50.615 --> 01:03:52.239
I will.
Okay.

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:53.589
Everything okay?

01:03:53.590 --> 01:03:56.010
I'm not sure how you want
to handle all these calendars.

01:03:57.196 --> 01:03:58.549
I thought we weren't selling them.

01:03:58.550 --> 01:04:00.069
We're not. They're buying them

01:04:00.070 --> 01:04:02.079
elsewhere and bringing
them in for autographs.

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:03.699
It seems they did a story

01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:04.866
on Channel Five about it earlier.

01:04:04.875 --> 01:04:06.722
That's cool. They must be selling okay.

01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:10.929
Yeah, but these guys want the
girls to autograph them now.

01:04:10.930 --> 01:04:12.079
I told them they have
to wait until they go

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:14.849
on break, but I want to
make sure that's okay.

01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:16.980
That's fine, they just can't
do it here at the tables.

01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:20.070
Gimme a second, I'll take care of it.

01:04:20.930 --> 01:04:22.779
Autographs?
Yeah, autographs.

01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:25.029
Autographs, they're
blackjack dealers Carter,

01:04:25.030 --> 01:04:26.319
what the hell are you telling me?

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:27.153
It's not even 8:30 yet,

01:04:27.154 --> 01:04:28.339
I've got more than a
dozen guys down there.

01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:29.173
This thing's gonna blow out of

01:04:29.174 --> 01:04:30.949
proportion if I don't take care of it.

01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:32.979
So I figured, I'll set
up a couple of tables

01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:36.249
and let the girls deal
with them on their break.

01:04:36.250 --> 01:04:38.719
It's a good thing, they'll
generate a little more cash

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:42.729
and besides, it'll at least
stop from disrupting the games.

01:04:42.730 --> 01:04:43.969
A lot of traffic, huh?

01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:45.999
Good for business, that's your theory.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.639
Yeah. If they hang out
for more time, they're gonna

01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:49.839
spend more money, so just
let me take care of it.

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:51.450
So, it's not all bad, is it?

01:04:52.518 --> 01:04:53.719
Do you want me to tell the gift

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:55.220
shop they can sell the extras?

01:04:56.776 --> 01:04:58.636
No.

01:04:58.637 --> 01:04:59.470
No.

01:05:00.770 --> 01:05:01.603
Jesus.

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:07.939
You guys just set that up at

01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:09.000
the other end. I'll be right down.

01:05:18.810 --> 01:05:21.939
What's up with Carter?
I was afraid of this.

01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:24.129
I've been a little flirty trying to

01:05:24.130 --> 01:05:26.887
get him to help with
the whole Josh situation

01:05:26.888 --> 01:05:29.139
and I think he thinks
I like him or something

01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:32.529
because he's been real
flirty the past week or so.

01:05:32.530 --> 01:05:34.433
Nice fucking job.

01:05:34.434 --> 01:05:36.559
We don't need you or anyone
in this pit getting undue

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:38.609
attention with everything
that's going down tonight.

01:05:38.610 --> 01:05:42.249
Don't worry about it.
I'm prepared for this.

01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:43.539
What does that mean?

01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:45.409
It means Carter won't be around

01:05:45.410 --> 01:05:47.450
to cause us any trouble tonight.

01:05:55.850 --> 01:05:58.580
All right guys, that's
all for now. Thank you.

01:06:00.490 --> 01:06:03.499
Hey, I'm not gonna
get much of a break here

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:05.919
but do you wanna join
me for a few minutes?

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:07.199
Definitely.

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:08.319
Do you wanna grab me an iced tea

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.570
and I'll meet you in a second?
You got it.

01:06:22.030 --> 01:06:22.863
Hey.
Hey.

01:06:24.270 --> 01:06:26.179
Well, those calendars
are sure moving, huh?

01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:27.580
Yeah, word really got out.

01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:32.139
Shit, I need sugar.
I'll get it for you.

01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:34.979
You want one or two.
Two.

01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:37.780
Two sugars coming up.
Thanks, you're a doll.

01:07:00.053 --> 01:07:01.970
You have a good time.

01:07:17.010 --> 01:07:19.399
Hey, what's your name?
Hi, how are you?

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:21.055
Hi, Wesley.

01:07:21.056 --> 01:07:22.329
Who should I make it out to?

01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:23.740
Jimmy.
To Jimmy.

01:07:25.002 --> 01:07:27.485
Thank you for coming.

01:07:27.486 --> 01:07:31.629
Thanks for coming out tonight.

01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:35.002
Thank you, Jimmy.
Thank you.

01:07:35.003 --> 01:07:36.527
Good, how are you doing tonight?

01:07:36.528 --> 01:07:40.195
Really good, thank you.
What's your name?

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:53.902
You are evil, girlie.

01:08:07.701 --> 01:08:08.951
You doing okay, Carter?

01:08:12.810 --> 01:08:13.643
No.

01:08:14.669 --> 01:08:15.669
No, I'm not.

01:08:17.046 --> 01:08:19.997
I tried to get a hold of Dean
but I can't find him anywhere.

01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:25.259
You okay with this?
Yeah, sure.

01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:26.630
I gotta get outta here, man.

01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:28.759
Just tell him I'm really sorry, okay?

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:32.849
I tried calling him, but he's
not picking up his cell phone.

01:08:32.850 --> 01:08:35.171
Go home and get some
rest. You look like shit.

01:08:35.173 --> 01:08:37.073
Thanks.
All right.

01:08:45.752 --> 01:08:46.803
Winner! Seven!

01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:51.499
Do five on six, five on eleven

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:54.319
and all the hard ways,
heavy on the eight.

01:08:55.752 --> 01:09:00.022
Gimme a five on ten.
4,000 change please.

01:09:00.023 --> 01:09:02.591
How you guys doing tonight?
We're doing great.

01:09:02.591 --> 01:09:03.759
Change only.

01:09:04.917 --> 01:09:06.617
4,000 on that.
Place your bets.

01:09:08.819 --> 01:09:11.969
Thank you. Would my little
love slaves like to play?

01:09:11.970 --> 01:09:13.412
Yeah.

01:09:13.412 --> 01:09:14.929
Hey, are you like somebody famous?

01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:16.319
No, but I think I've died

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:18.270
and these are three of my 72 virgins.

01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:23.158
Let's play!

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:24.859
So, I see your brother made it.

01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:28.639
Yeah, I had no idea.

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:31.988
Good for him. Maybe
he'll get laid out of this.

01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:34.109
Hey, that's my baby brother.

01:09:36.350 --> 01:09:38.560
All right, are you ready to go?

01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:40.343
All set.

01:09:41.794 --> 01:09:42.670
You nervous?

01:09:43.689 --> 01:09:46.469
Hell yeah, but I'm psyched, too.

01:09:46.470 --> 01:09:49.919
I mean I've never even
shoplifted a candy bar before.

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:50.790
But I'm ready.

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:00.470
2,000 on the hop, three-six.

01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:04.789
That's a bet.
Come on, hard ten.

01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:06.869
Shit, I could use a hard ten tonight.

01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:08.940
Any of you guys be able
to help me out with that?

01:10:10.465 --> 01:10:12.339
Ah, too bad.

01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:14.290
Looks like it's just you tonight, sexy.

01:10:15.230 --> 01:10:16.100
Come on, ten!

01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:19.670
Six, six the hard way.

01:10:22.190 --> 01:10:24.139
Come on baby, hard ten.

01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:25.880
2,000 on the hop.
That's a bet!

01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:30.870
Yes, all right, all right, hell yeah!

01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:34.009
That's $2,000.

01:10:34.010 --> 01:10:36.110
I'm sure it is. I just have to count it.

01:10:36.970 --> 01:10:38.700
You can change that up, too.

01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:41.540
Make it $32,000.

01:10:44.610 --> 01:10:46.009
Come on baby, no seven.

01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:47.982
Come on, you dirty little sluts.

01:10:47.983 --> 01:10:49.850
I'm you're dirty little slut.

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.730
Two grand on the hop!
Bet on the hop.

01:10:53.749 --> 01:10:54.820
You make me so hot.

01:10:59.166 --> 01:10:59.999
Is this okay?

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.829
Yeah, technically it's fine, but I can't

01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:03.389
have you taking any more clothes off or

01:11:03.390 --> 01:11:05.779
we're gonna have a
problem with security.

01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:09.229
You got it.

01:11:09.230 --> 01:11:11.299
Six the hard way! Winner on the hop!

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:13.280
Wow.
Yeah, all right!

01:11:14.739 --> 01:11:17.439
How much is that? How much did I get?

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:20.380
On the hopping bet, it's
30-to-one, so that's 60 grand.

01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:23.026
Fuck me with a panda!

01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:30.809
Two grand on the hop, fifty-five.

01:11:30.810 --> 01:11:33.787
Two grand on the hop.
Seven out!

01:11:35.410 --> 01:11:36.243
Time to go.

01:11:40.012 --> 01:11:41.309
This is

01:11:41.310 --> 01:11:42.569
for the dealers, thanks.

01:11:42.570 --> 01:11:44.979
1,000 on a 60 grand win.

01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:46.320
More like 80 grand.

01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:48.839
Piece of shit.

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:50.006
It happens.

01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:59.360
Money plays!
Money plays to the limit.

01:12:00.271 --> 01:12:01.188
Go ahead.

01:12:11.170 --> 01:12:12.420
Come on, come on, over.

01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:14.525
Yeah!

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:15.633
All right.

01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:19.369
You can change the cash in, too.

01:12:19.370 --> 01:12:20.669
Sure thing.

01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:22.899
Sir, there's no problem doing that, but

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:24.879
that'll take the cash total over 10,000

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:27.049
and we'll have to fill out
a CTR for the government.

01:12:27.050 --> 01:12:30.019
Okay, so what does that mean?

01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:31.239
I just need to see some I.D.

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:33.819
and take down your
Social Security number.

01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:35.269
Just a form for the government

01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:37.986
to track large cash transactions.

01:12:37.987 --> 01:12:40.650
No problem. It's not
like I'm a drug dealer.

01:12:41.723 --> 01:12:42.556
You can't make my kinda money

01:12:42.557 --> 01:12:44.230
dealing drugs, know what I'm saying?

01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:48.733
Sweet!

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:51.393
Oh yeah, yep.

01:12:52.706 --> 01:12:54.258
Woo hoo, yeah baby!

01:12:55.490 --> 01:12:57.839
Very nicely done, sir.
Thank you, thank you.

01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:59.840
You can change up the cash again for me.

01:13:01.746 --> 01:13:02.746
All right.

01:13:04.150 --> 01:13:06.099
Hey.
Hey.

01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:07.189
See the good looking guy in

01:13:07.190 --> 01:13:09.509
the tight black shirt over there?

01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:12.759
He's seriously hot and
seriously into you

01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:15.920
and he wants an autograph
and if you're lucky, a wife.

01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:20.810
He's cute.
And then some.

01:13:24.231 --> 01:13:25.314
Four, five.

01:14:07.150 --> 01:14:08.901
Come on, come on, come on.

01:14:08.902 --> 01:14:10.200
Oh, she never goes bust!

01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:14.120
You know, I've overstayed
my welcome here, so

01:14:15.093 --> 01:14:17.243
that's for you, miss.
Thanks, good luck.

01:14:21.860 --> 01:14:25.039
Well, let's hope you can
be good to me there, Erin.

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:27.730
I hope so, your tailor sure wasn't.

01:14:30.183 --> 01:14:32.183
I don't have a tailor.

01:14:34.976 --> 01:14:35.976
Good luck.

01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:40.370
Hi guys. Place your bets.

01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:44.000
Come on, come on, have something little.

01:14:44.933 --> 01:14:48.292
Oh, you're not supposed
to get blackjack, we are.

01:14:48.293 --> 01:14:49.930
Time for me to move on again.

01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:00.399
Well, hello there, beautiful lady.

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:02.389
How are you?
Great, thank you.

01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:04.640
Change please.
How would you like it?

01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:08.839
Well, now that depends. What
exactly are we talking about?

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:11.020
Down boy. How would you like your chips?

01:15:13.618 --> 01:15:15.951
Hundreds, please.
All right.

01:15:18.670 --> 01:15:19.720
Place your bets.

01:15:22.281 --> 01:15:24.781
There we go, a little of this.

01:15:27.564 --> 01:15:28.564
Excuse me.

01:15:35.446 --> 01:15:37.946
That's enough there.

01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:44.340
No more bets.

01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:51.612
35 black!
Oh ho ho, yeah baby!

01:15:51.613 --> 01:15:55.009
I'm a winner, I'm a winner,
I'm a winner, oh yeah!

01:15:55.010 --> 01:15:57.099
Man, you really need to stop that.

01:15:57.100 --> 01:16:01.259
It's just not working for
anybody, especially you.

01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:03.199
Bring it on, bring
it on, gimme the money!

01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:04.033
Paige.

01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:09.190
Seven black, 24-5.
Yep, go ahead.

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:12.029
There you go.
For you.

01:16:12.030 --> 01:16:14.679
Thank you.
Keep 'em coming.

01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:18.459
First decent tip this cheap
bastard's given us all night.

01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:19.500
Place your bets.

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:27.273
High limit.

01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:32.345
Is our Bahama beatnik still there?

01:16:33.793 --> 01:16:35.185
How much is he at now?

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:38.419
All right, I'll be there in a minute.

01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:41.899
Right now I've got Mr. Yi here
and he's filling our coffers.

01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:43.950
Did Billy come by and
sweet talk him yet?

01:16:45.370 --> 01:16:46.653
Well, call him again.

01:16:47.166 --> 01:16:48.819
In the meantime, make sure this guy

01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:49.979
knows he can have whatever he wants

01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:51.680
and tell him a host is on the way.

01:16:54.897 --> 01:16:57.149
Ow!
Nice hit.

01:16:57.150 --> 01:16:58.770
Gracias, mademoiselle.

01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:08.826
Seven out.

01:17:08.827 --> 01:17:11.379
All right. That's it. We're leaving.

01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:13.749
Bye, guys.
I'm sorry.

01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:15.809
We would stay longer,
but we'll be having

01:17:15.810 --> 01:17:19.549
sex together later and
that's three of them total.

01:17:19.550 --> 01:17:22.119
We'll be doing things that
are illegal in Uganda.

01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:24.179
No more bets.

01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:25.100
You're not Ugandan, are you?

01:17:25.101 --> 01:17:26.410
No.
Gimme that.

01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:29.439
Whoa.

01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:32.699
Hey!
Oh shit! I'm sorry.

01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:34.210
No spin! Paige.

01:17:35.610 --> 01:17:37.229
What the fuck?

01:17:37.230 --> 01:17:39.549
I'm sorry, we were
just screwing around.

01:17:39.550 --> 01:17:42.349
This is not cool. I can
have you thrown out for this.

01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:43.959
In most places, you would be.

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:46.359
Sorry, I'll keep my
clothes on from now on.

01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:47.510
You bite your tongue.

01:17:53.694 --> 01:17:55.980
You know, I think I wanna get laid.

01:17:57.550 --> 01:17:58.420
Thanks, Madison.

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:01.869
Thanks was all you
really needed right there.

01:18:01.870 --> 01:18:04.839
Yeah, well, I thought
maybe you might reply

01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:07.409
by telling me what time
you get off tonight.

01:18:07.410 --> 01:18:10.139
Ooh yeah, but first I
have to go home and take

01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:13.410
my medication for my STD,
but I can come right back.

01:18:15.225 --> 01:18:16.460
Goodnight, love muffin.

01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:18.570
Thanks for playing.

01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:26.439
Hi, this is Paige in the Sin Pit.

01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:28.179
We have Mr. Kaylin coming your way

01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:30.709
with about half a million in chips.

01:18:30.710 --> 01:18:33.219
You might want to give
him the VIP treatment.

01:18:33.220 --> 01:18:34.053
Okay, thanks.

01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:52.333
Hey.

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:54.393
Yours?

01:18:55.685 --> 01:18:57.079
Yeah, thanks.

01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:59.309
These are the good ones.
You wanna hold on to those.

01:18:59.310 --> 01:19:00.300
You got that right,

01:19:00.301 --> 01:19:02.619
worked like hell to get
it in the first place.

01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:04.529
Looks like you're having a good day.

01:19:04.530 --> 01:19:07.759
You could say I'm kicking some ass.

01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:08.593
Yeah, well,

01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:12.029
I hope it keeps up that way for you.

01:19:12.030 --> 01:19:12.863
Thanks, Dean.

01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:31.799
Hello, Mr. Kaylin.
I'm Cheryl, the cage manager.

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:33.549
Cheryl, nice to meet you.

01:19:33.550 --> 01:19:34.909
I understand
you did quite well tonight.

01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:35.743
Yeah.

01:19:35.744 --> 01:19:37.449
Would you like
to cash out in private?

01:19:37.450 --> 01:19:39.450
Awesome.
All right, right this way.

01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:48.219
And how would
you like that, Mr. Kaylin?

01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:50.429
Cash, please.
Cash?

01:19:50.430 --> 01:19:52.639
I came in here with cash,
I'd like to leave with it.

01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:54.289
We can certainly do that for you.

01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:56.689
But you do realize that's almost 5,000

01:19:56.690 --> 01:19:59.579
$100 bills to the tune
of about 10 pounds

01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:02.391
No problem, Cheryl. I got this.

01:20:02.392 --> 01:20:03.749
Okay, just give me a few minutes

01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:05.089
and I'll put that together for you.

01:20:05.090 --> 01:20:05.923
Great.

01:20:07.890 --> 01:20:10.200
You got that? Thanks.
Yeah, here you go, sir.

01:20:18.181 --> 01:20:20.099
Hey, I tried calling you earlier.

01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:23.430
Yeah, I was in the club
for a couple of hours but

01:20:25.233 --> 01:20:26.783
I had a crazy night last night.

01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:30.360
Carter went home sick.

01:20:30.361 --> 01:20:31.829
Why didn't he come to me
with that information first?

01:20:31.830 --> 01:20:32.880
He should've told me.

01:20:33.754 --> 01:20:35.799
He tried calling you.
He was trying to find you

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:38.050
but he looked like shit,
so I told him to go.

01:20:38.970 --> 01:20:40.619
Well,

01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:41.510
everything okay?

01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:44.539
Some new guy kicked
our ass in the Sin Pit,

01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:47.199
but we more than made
up for it in high limit.

01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:49.849
Mr. Yi is stuck at 600, he's got another

01:20:49.850 --> 01:20:51.729
400 available and I
think he's gonna dump

01:20:51.730 --> 01:20:53.730
that as well before he calls it a night.

01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:55.820
Who's that new girl?

01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:57.753
Claudia.

01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:00.213
Here.

01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:04.140
Thanks for the info.
All right.

01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:12.219
Excellent! Thank you very much, Cheryl.

01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:14.190
This has been a lot of fun.

01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:17.280
I must comeback and do it again soon.

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:20.350
Smells like a day at the beach.

01:21:22.830 --> 01:21:24.180
I'd love to share but, nah.

01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:58.989
Just let me know when you find out.

01:21:58.990 --> 01:22:00.229
Okay.
What happened?

01:22:00.230 --> 01:22:01.659
Call me back.

01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:03.049
They're going through
the entire drop again.

01:22:03.050 --> 01:22:04.900
It looks like it was about 300 grand.

01:22:05.997 --> 01:22:07.989
$300,000 in counterfeit bills,

01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:09.599
and disappears just like that?

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:10.609
A team.

01:22:10.610 --> 01:22:12.729
It wasn't a team. It was one guy.

01:22:12.730 --> 01:22:14.569
One guy. One fuckin' guy.

01:22:14.570 --> 01:22:17.329
Yeah, he spent the
entire time in the Sin Pit.

01:22:17.330 --> 01:22:19.099
And nobody suspected anything, huh?

01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:21.569
As far as I can tell,
everybody followed protocol.

01:22:21.570 --> 01:22:22.889
The cops say the money's top notch,

01:22:22.890 --> 01:22:24.640
it probably came out of North Korea.

01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:28.999
You look kinda pale.
I feel like shit.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.169
I got food poisoning last night.

01:22:30.170 --> 01:22:31.930
In here?
Yeah, in here.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.109
Which girl was the one who
was taking all the money?

01:22:36.110 --> 01:22:37.769
All of 'em, like I said,
he was bouncing around

01:22:37.770 --> 01:22:40.659
the Sin Pit spreading it all
around from table to table.

01:22:40.660 --> 01:22:41.600
Okay, let's go.

01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:47.729
What do we know about this guy anyway?

01:22:47.730 --> 01:22:48.690
It's right here.

01:22:52.458 --> 01:22:54.449
I just ran into this fool.

01:22:54.450 --> 01:22:56.339
A while ago, I just ran into him.

01:22:56.340 --> 01:22:57.639
We got his ID and his Social

01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:59.189
but they're both certainly fake.

01:22:59.190 --> 01:23:01.059
Obviously. What about a name?

01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:03.890
Jimmy, Jimmy Kaylin.
Jimmy Kaylin.

01:23:05.152 --> 01:23:07.223
Well, that's kinda personal.

01:23:07.224 --> 01:23:09.579
I mean like Jimmy Kaylin, the painter.

01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:11.449
He's my favorite artist, okay?

01:23:11.450 --> 01:23:13.869
The fuckin' guy is on my wall,

01:23:13.870 --> 01:23:15.870
I have a painting right
here in my office.

01:23:18.490 --> 01:23:19.580
Oh, shit.

01:23:31.425 --> 01:23:32.430
It's a joke, right?

01:23:40.816 --> 01:23:42.483
How did this happen?

01:23:46.477 --> 01:23:48.137
I want that guy found.

01:23:48.138 --> 01:23:50.388
The cops are all over it.

01:23:54.030 --> 01:23:54.940
Jesus.

01:23:56.028 --> 01:23:57.039
The guy's a professional,

01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:59.609
he went through those
locks in two seconds.

01:23:59.610 --> 01:24:01.747
Unless you didn't lock it behind you.

01:24:01.748 --> 01:24:02.915
I always do.

01:24:23.944 --> 01:24:26.170
Cameras got a couple more
shots of him on the way out.

01:24:35.986 --> 01:24:37.286
Who is that fuckin' guy?

01:24:38.270 --> 01:24:39.360
Who's he working for?

01:24:40.904 --> 01:24:42.854
I'm gonna go fire that motherfucker.

01:24:45.010 --> 01:24:47.220
You didn't find it at all unusual, a man

01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:50.940
walking out of a casino
with a giant oil painting?

01:24:51.790 --> 01:24:53.259
Yeah, I thought it was unusual but

01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:55.179
I didn't find anything
suspicious about it.

01:24:55.180 --> 01:24:56.013
Last week a guy walked through

01:24:56.014 --> 01:24:58.589
the casino with an eight
foot plastic pickle.

01:24:58.590 --> 01:25:00.109
What did he say to you?

01:25:00.110 --> 01:25:00.943
He said he worked for one of the

01:25:00.944 --> 01:25:03.140
hamburger places and
they were doing training.

01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:06.609
The guy last night,
what did he say to you?

01:25:06.610 --> 01:25:07.490
He said something like

01:25:07.491 --> 01:25:09.540
"Have a good night" and
I said "You, too."

01:25:10.580 --> 01:25:11.689
Why didn't you just help him

01:25:11.690 --> 01:25:14.229
carry it out to the car
while you were at it?

01:25:14.230 --> 01:25:15.190
It never occurred to you that

01:25:15.191 --> 01:25:16.990
it might be Mr. Belding's painting?

01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:19.059
I never even knew he had paintings.

01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:20.819
I've never been to his office.

01:25:20.820 --> 01:25:24.300
And you never will be
'cause you're fuckin' fired.

01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:33.289
What's up?

01:25:33.290 --> 01:25:34.890
They want to see you upstairs.

01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:36.713
Okay.

01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:41.450
Everything's okay.

01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:52.299
You heard about the crime
committed here last night?

01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:55.169
Of course.
I'm not big on rumors.

01:25:55.170 --> 01:25:56.509
Why don't you fill me in?

01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:59.349
Yeah, everyone's talking about it.

01:25:59.350 --> 01:26:02.599
You took in about 200 of those.

01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:04.949
I can't tell even now,
knowing they're fake.

01:26:04.950 --> 01:26:06.989
Rumor is I'm not the only one.

01:26:06.990 --> 01:26:09.949
Am I gonna get fired?
Come on, look at these.

01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:11.699
Can you really tell the difference?

01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:15.169
Did you notice anything
unusual last night?

01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:17.959
The whole calendar thing
was way out of the norm.

01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:19.129
Did you see them?

01:26:19.130 --> 01:26:21.860
You really should, I look so hot.

01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:25.289
We were signing
autographs on our breaks.

01:26:25.290 --> 01:26:27.409
Some guy was screwing
around with his girlfriend,

01:26:27.410 --> 01:26:30.169
threw her shirt in the
wheel, screwing up the spin.

01:26:30.170 --> 01:26:32.979
I had a guy offer me a
grand for my underwear.

01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:35.389
I had some guys at my
table and they were speaking

01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:38.589
French and they said they were
from Canada and I was like

01:26:38.590 --> 01:26:42.769
"Yeah right! I've been to
Canada! They don't speak French."

01:26:42.770 --> 01:26:45.720
I wasn't wearing any, so
I bought Zuri's for 300.

01:26:46.758 --> 01:26:48.130
What? No, no.

01:26:49.010 --> 01:26:51.459
About this guy.
No, I mean,

01:26:51.460 --> 01:26:54.069
he was a weird guy with a lot of cash.

01:26:54.070 --> 01:26:56.439
It's par for the course around here.

01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:59.689
He smelled kinda funny,
not like B.O.-funny,

01:26:59.690 --> 01:27:02.699
more like bad cheese.

01:27:02.700 --> 01:27:04.139
He tried to pick me up but

01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:05.900
there's nothing unusual about that.

01:27:06.883 --> 01:27:09.109
He was sniffling a little, so

01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:11.329
I thought maybe he was on cocaine.

01:27:11.330 --> 01:27:12.750
God, that sounds arrogant.

01:27:13.710 --> 01:27:15.729
I didn't mean it that way.

01:27:15.730 --> 01:27:17.719
What was the question again?

01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:20.029
On the tape, you don't seem to

01:27:20.030 --> 01:27:22.759
give the cash more
than a cursory glance.

01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:25.319
I gave the cash as much
attention as any other dealer.

01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:26.699
You want us to keep the game moving.

01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:28.869
If you want to give us a
little pen, have us check out

01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:31.769
every bill, then that's fine
but that's not the policy.

01:27:31.770 --> 01:27:33.999
You want a fast game and you blame us

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.749
when we get counterfeit money?

01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:37.914
Excuse the language,
but that's bullshit.

01:27:37.915 --> 01:27:40.669
Okay, okay, easy.

01:27:40.670 --> 01:27:42.699
I gave it as much attention as I gave

01:27:42.700 --> 01:27:43.979
all the other money I've taken in

01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:46.030
over the past six years
I've worked here.

01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:49.039
You ever seen this guy before?

01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:52.039
I think I'd remember
him. He was kind of a dork.

01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:54.299
Nope, but if you showed me
all the guys that were in my

01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:57.059
pit last night, I probably
wouldn't recognize half of them.

01:27:57.060 --> 01:27:59.229
He looked like every guy that I saw on

01:27:59.230 --> 01:28:02.389
the seniors trip that I
took my mom to last year.

01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:04.989
Have you sent any pictures
to the Carnival Cruise Line?

01:28:04.990 --> 01:28:08.769
So, you only seen him this one time?

01:28:08.770 --> 01:28:10.119
Yeah.

01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:11.529
That's right.

01:28:11.530 --> 01:28:12.363
Yes, sir.

01:28:15.626 --> 01:28:17.390
We did it, baby.
Thank you.

01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:20.469
Thank you so much.

01:28:20.470 --> 01:28:22.489
It was a helluva lot
of fun, I can tell ya.

01:28:22.490 --> 01:28:23.660
You were great.

01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:34.578
What was the final haul?
480.

01:28:35.130 --> 01:28:37.930
Wow, I can't believe
you guys did this for me.

01:28:39.450 --> 01:28:41.300
I couldn't think of a better cause.

01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:43.930
How did Raine find you?

01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:47.620
I'm afraid that's classified.

01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:51.039
Serves me right for being nosy.

01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:53.499
So, I think we should split

01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:55.469
the remaining money into six shares.

01:28:55.470 --> 01:28:57.093
Yeah.
Five.

01:28:59.070 --> 01:29:01.697
I already got what I wanted out of this.

01:29:01.698 --> 01:29:04.225
You don't even know me, do you?

01:29:04.226 --> 01:29:05.120
No.

01:29:05.121 --> 01:29:07.919
I mean aside from
helping you and your son,

01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:10.890
I got something else out of
this and I'm more than content.

01:29:12.140 --> 01:29:14.140
I know better than to ask, so I won't.

01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:17.380
You ladies enjoy the spoils.

01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:26.539
Oh, my god!
Right?

01:29:26.540 --> 01:29:28.340
No red flags from what I can tell.

01:29:29.935 --> 01:29:31.409
What are we gonna do?

01:29:31.410 --> 01:29:32.949
We'll get his info to every casino

01:29:32.950 --> 01:29:34.619
in the state and in the country.

01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:36.419
He made a big haul last
night. He'll probably

01:29:36.420 --> 01:29:38.950
get greedy and get nabbed
somewhere down the road.

01:29:40.350 --> 01:29:42.719
What happens if he doesn't get greedy?

01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:45.279
I assume you have insurance
for this sort of thing.

01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:46.859
I don't give a damn about the money.

01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:48.540
I want my fuckin' painting back

01:29:49.621 --> 01:29:50.779
and I'd like him to go to jail.

01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:52.629
Well, if he tries to sell the painting,

01:29:52.630 --> 01:29:55.759
we can nail him there,
too, but I gotta tell ya,

01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:57.540
this case is getting cold.

01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:02.349
I don't know what the
cop equivalent is of

01:30:02.350 --> 01:30:05.379
bedside manner but you
sure don't fuckin' have it.

01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:08.519
Look, Mr. Belding, two
weeks ago, I nailed a creep

01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:11.409
that was slinging heroin
to junior high schoolers.

01:30:11.410 --> 01:30:14.409
Last week, I locked up a pediatrician

01:30:14.410 --> 01:30:16.224
who was a little too
friendly with his patients.

01:30:16.225 --> 01:30:17.170
Okay, all right.

01:30:17.171 --> 01:30:18.869
I'm not gonna sit here
while you lean over

01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:20.969
me and tell me about
all your goddamn cases.

01:30:20.970 --> 01:30:23.504
Fine, the Secret Service will be happy

01:30:23.505 --> 01:30:25.373
to look at this more than I have but...

01:30:25.374 --> 01:30:26.374
Good workin' with ya.
If you expect 'em to give

01:30:26.375 --> 01:30:28.759
more than two shit about
that painting of yours,

01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:30.982
you're just gonna cry
yourself to sleep, mister.

01:30:30.983 --> 01:30:31.850
Okay, McCloud.

01:30:37.540 --> 01:30:39.540
All right buddy, you ready for a ride?

01:30:40.530 --> 01:30:41.559
Okay.

01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:43.619
It'll be over before you know it.

01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:45.529
I'll be right here
when you get out, okay?

01:30:45.530 --> 01:30:47.490
I won't go anywhere.
Got it.

01:31:25.055 --> 01:31:25.888
Hey.
Hi.

01:31:25.889 --> 01:31:29.459
What was the final tally?
37 each, but the calendars

01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:33.065
are still hot so it could be
20 more by the time we're done.

01:31:33.066 --> 01:31:34.400
Whoa, that's a new car.

01:31:35.970 --> 01:31:38.300
Are you sure you don't want your cut?

01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:40.210
Come on.

01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:44.450
All right.

01:31:50.757 --> 01:31:52.429
Who wants to go to Costa Rica?

01:31:52.430 --> 01:31:54.279
I would love to but that means we'd

01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:56.699
have to shut down the
Sin Pit for a week.

01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:58.369
Screw it, let's just
leave Sunday morning

01:31:58.370 --> 01:32:00.749
and get back Friday in the
morning in time for work.

01:32:00.750 --> 01:32:03.999
I'm totally up for that.
Yeah.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.190
Me, too.

01:32:08.300 --> 01:32:09.133
He's back.

01:32:10.593 --> 01:32:11.593
Oh, sweetie!

01:32:13.369 --> 01:32:15.020
Hi.

01:32:17.015 --> 01:32:20.098
How have you been?
How are you guys?

01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:50.189
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:32:50.190 --> 01:32:51.023
Come on in.

01:32:55.090 --> 01:32:58.357
This look is not working for me at all.

01:32:58.358 --> 01:32:59.700
Come on, give it a try.

01:33:04.670 --> 01:33:07.909
I'm, I'm sorry, I can't.

01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:10.761
I know you went through
a lot of trouble, but

01:33:10.762 --> 01:33:12.362
I'm not gonna fuck Jimmy Kaylin.

01:33:13.790 --> 01:33:16.340
Well, I did go through a lot of trouble.

01:33:17.181 --> 01:33:18.264
Are you sure?

01:33:20.007 --> 01:33:21.445
