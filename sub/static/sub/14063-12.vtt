00:02.653 --> 00:04.371
- I hit her on the head with a skillet.
- Ah.

00:04.533 --> 00:06.444
It wasn't premeditated or planned.

00:06.613 --> 00:09.366
She was berating me.
Suddenly, my arm was in motion.

00:09.533 --> 00:11.364
Bam, I hit her, and she went down.

00:11.533 --> 00:12.522
DELLA: Ah.
FERRION: Oh!

00:12.693 --> 00:17.084
- Mom?
- He hit me on the head with a skillet.

00:17.253 --> 00:19.369
- They called the police?
- I'm afraid so.

00:19.533 --> 00:20.522
What do I do?

00:20.693 --> 00:21.762
DOCTOR: Mr. Ferrion.
- What?

00:21.933 --> 00:23.446
Your mother has passed away.

00:23.613 --> 00:26.446
- Victim identified the defendant.
- Hearsay.

00:26.613 --> 00:28.365
- This all you've got?
- We'll get more.

00:28.533 --> 00:30.967
The charges against Mr. Ferrion
are dismissed.

ALAN: I see in you, Bernie,
an innately kind person.

00:34.453 --> 00:37.889
I'm hoping it's the kind, gentle
person who goes on from here...

00:38.053 --> 00:39.805
...not the one who swung that skillet.

SHIRLEY:
How bad is he?

00:50.213 --> 00:52.408
PAUL: He's intermittently brilliant
and nonsensical...

00:52.573 --> 00:54.484
...often at the same time.

00:54.653 --> 00:56.530
He's technically in charge
of litigation?

00:56.693 --> 00:58.445
PAUL:
Which is the reason I called you back.

00:58.613 --> 01:01.411
He is an enormous rainmaker, Shirley.
And yet...

Where is everybody?

01:12.173 --> 01:14.448
This is an administrative meeting,

01:14.853 --> 01:17.811
Oh. What the hell am I doing here?

01:17.973 --> 01:21.329
Remember the good old days when
you liked to know what was going on?

01:21.493 --> 01:24.724
When you could go from your office
to the elevator without a road map?

01:26.133 --> 01:28.363
Didn't need a road map...

01:28.533 --> 01:30.888
...to find my way around your body,
did I, Shirley?

01:31.413 --> 01:34.610
I wouldn't know. I was usually asleep.

01:35.213 --> 01:38.603
I once had her and Streisand...

01:39.413 --> 01:40.448
...at the same time.

01:41.413 --> 01:42.971

01:46.453 --> 01:49.923

but that was a female impersonator.

01:51.013 --> 01:53.322
Perhaps the penis
might have been your cue.

That wasn't Barbra Streisand?

01:58.613 --> 02:01.127

- Yes, Sally. Bad news.

02:01.293 --> 02:03.488
We lost the summary judgment motion
on Winchell.

02:03.653 --> 02:05.644
- Have a seat.
- Ugh. We lost?

02:05.933 --> 02:08.765
The judge held that the magazine,
while possibly negligent...

02:08.933 --> 02:11.731
...wasn't guilty of reckless disregard
for the truth.

02:11.893 --> 02:13.929
So we could prevail under negligence?

02:14.093 --> 02:17.051
We could, if only we'd thought
to plead negligence.

02:19.173 --> 02:22.290
Count one: Intentional infliction
of emotional distress.

02:22.453 --> 02:24.842
Count two: Reckless disregard
for the truth.

02:25.013 --> 02:27.652
Uh, here's where there should have
been a count of negligence.

02:27.813 --> 02:30.885
There is no third count
alleging negligence.

02:31.053 --> 02:34.728
In the supporting memoranda
we have pages on negligence.

02:34.893 --> 02:36.531
But you didn't plead it.

02:36.853 --> 02:40.323
- So we just file a motion to amend.
- That deadline lapsed.

02:43.453 --> 02:45.444
Uh, this is...

02:45.613 --> 02:47.126
This is obviously an oversight.

02:47.293 --> 02:49.124
The defendant had constructive notice.

02:49.653 --> 02:51.564
We can appeal this.
I'll get right on it.

02:51.733 --> 02:55.408
I've taken the liberty of reviewing
some of your other work, Sally.

02:55.573 --> 02:57.962
You're a very good lawyer.

02:58.133 --> 03:00.363
But not good enough.
We're letting you go.

- I'm sorry.

03:13.613 --> 03:16.844
- I have done a lot of good work here.
- Yes, you have.

03:17.133 --> 03:19.886
And any number of law firms
would be happy to have you.

03:20.053 --> 03:23.363

just doesn't happen to be one of them.

It was my decision.

Paul and Denny still remain
strong supporters.

03:35.133 --> 03:38.284
We're streamlining a little,
and I have to make some tough calls.

03:38.453 --> 03:40.284
I'm sorry.

How can you come in here...

- Nora, outstanding. I give it a three.
- Thank you.

Mr. Crane?

04:46.653 --> 04:49.725
A Mr. Walter Fife is in your office.
He says it's quite important.

04:49.893 --> 04:50.882
DENNY:
Oh, thank you.

04:51.053 --> 04:55.365
- Uh, may I ask, do I know you?
- I'm Alan Shore's assistant.

04:55.533 --> 04:57.967
Mr. Fife came to our office
when he couldn't find you.

04:58.173 --> 05:01.563
- I escorted him back to your office.
- Excellent. I'll be right there.

05:09.093 --> 05:11.687
You're waiting for me to tell you
where your office is?

05:11.853 --> 05:14.572
No, I want to see the look
on your face when you realize...

...they still come looking
for one man to solve their problems.

05:17.813 --> 05:20.327
They don't come barging in
looking for Paul or you.

- It's a little personal.

Ten o'clock.

05:56.973 --> 06:00.045
They didn't just sue the school board.
They sued me personally.

06:00.213 --> 06:03.046
Walter, I can assure you
their cause of action is baseless.

06:03.213 --> 06:05.363
- I haven't even told you what it is yet.
- L...

- Hi, Shirley Schmidt.
- This is Walter Fife.

06:08.493 --> 06:11.087
He's superintendent
of the Middlesex School District.

06:11.253 --> 06:14.848
He's being sued. What did you do,
a little touchy-feely with a student?

06:15.133 --> 06:18.569
What? God no.
What kind of question is that?

...are you being sued?

You promised you'd answer.

creationism along with Darwinism...

...in the eighth-grade
science curriculum.

I terminated their employment, they sued.

Plus, I mean, it's not like they've
given me very much to do.

- Perhaps.

This is a three.

- All kinds.

terrible dirty things in his ear.

12:21.653 --> 12:22.847
I never meant to kill her.

12:23.013 --> 12:25.766
You went over to make an omelet
and things got out of hand?

12:25.933 --> 12:28.572
She knew. She heard an argument
between me and mother.

12:28.733 --> 12:30.883
She was out there watering
her stupid plants.

12:31.053 --> 12:33.965
In the winter, for God's sakes.
The woman is not right.

12:34.133 --> 12:35.168
Or wasn't right.

12:35.773 --> 12:37.809
Alan, she was going to call the police.

12:37.973 --> 12:40.009
She said what she heard
would not be hearsay.

12:40.173 --> 12:43.051
She looked it up. She said,
because we were arguing, it would...

12:43.213 --> 12:45.522
It would qualify
as an excited blutterance.

12:46.333 --> 12:49.723
Suddenly, the skillet was in my hand,
and I swung.

12:49.893 --> 12:53.169
"Blutterance" isn't even a real word,
much less a defense.

12:53.333 --> 12:55.483
You've murdered somebody
over a fake word!

12:55.653 --> 12:57.962
I was careful to not leave any evidence.

12:58.693 --> 13:01.446
- I went over there stealth-like...
- Oh, for God's sake.

13:01.613 --> 13:04.810
- And I staged a break-in in the back.

13:04.973 --> 13:07.203
I dispatched of her,
and then I returned.

13:07.373 --> 13:10.683
Alan, I promise you,
this will be the very, very last one.

13:10.893 --> 13:13.646
- I'm not representing you.
- You must, if it comes to that.

13:13.813 --> 13:16.611
I won't. You've let me down terribly.

13:16.773 --> 13:20.448
Uh... But... But you said that you stood
for the little man.

13:20.893 --> 13:22.849
I'm little!

13:33.853 --> 13:36.970
The best thing would be to go
for an immediate declaratory judgment.

13:37.133 --> 13:40.728
The last thing we want is a trial.
This is a hot-button issue.

13:40.893 --> 13:43.612
The ACLU will be jumping in,
and that's only the beginning.

13:43.773 --> 13:46.128
- Why have I been taken off this case?
- You haven't.

13:46.293 --> 13:49.205
You've been relieved of the grunt work
because it's beneath you.

13:49.373 --> 13:53.127
"Relieved" is soft for "discharged."
I recognize a demotion when I see one.

13:53.293 --> 13:56.763
I am the master of the soft discharge.

13:56.933 --> 13:58.924
You refer again
to when we were intimate.

13:59.093 --> 14:02.369
Now, pay attention
and pretend you have a clue.

14:03.613 --> 14:05.843
- We all set?
- Lock and load.

14:06.013 --> 14:07.526
Let's go.

14:10.053 --> 14:11.327
- Lori.
LORl: Alan.

14:11.493 --> 14:14.371
Alan, a second.
We have a little problem.

14:14.533 --> 14:17.047
Seems you've been sexually harassing
Nora Jacobs.

14:17.213 --> 14:19.522
- She signed a waiver.
- I'm sorry?

14:19.693 --> 14:22.207
I make all my female employees sign
sexual-harassment waivers.

14:22.373 --> 14:23.726
Especially the pretty ones.

14:23.893 --> 14:25.804
Don't think that would hold up
in court...

14:25.973 --> 14:30.524
...but regardless, that kind of behavior
isn't tolerated at Crane Poole & Schmidt.

14:31.493 --> 14:34.451
Which kind of behavior, specifically?

14:34.773 --> 14:37.492
I think you're smart enough
to sense where the line is.

14:37.653 --> 14:39.723
I'm never sure until I cross it.

14:39.893 --> 14:42.202
She is a subordinate.
There's a disparity of power.

14:42.373 --> 14:45.251
You will refrain from any sexual
advances, verbal or otherwise.

14:45.653 --> 14:49.851
Shirley, what about senior partners?

14:50.013 --> 14:54.165
There would be nothing wrong with me
lusting, say, after you, would there?

14:56.693 --> 14:59.048
Go subscribe to National Geographic.

14:59.213 --> 15:03.001
Make a list of all the places
you'll never get to visit.

15:03.173 --> 15:06.324
Add to that list "Schmidt."

15:11.493 --> 15:14.849
- I'll talk to her, but other than that...
- You can't pull some strings?

15:15.013 --> 15:18.050
- What about Alan? He pulls rabbits...
- He's not a partner, you are.

15:18.213 --> 15:20.124
I slept with Alan.
How objective can he be?

15:20.293 --> 15:23.729
You also slept with me. Ever think
that might be part of the problem?

15:29.613 --> 15:33.288
That was unfair.
Kick me while I'm down.

15:33.453 --> 15:35.205
I guess I should've expected it.

15:43.413 --> 15:46.928
- The police want to question me.
- That's really a stunner, Bernie.

15:47.093 --> 15:50.608
They arrested you for whacking your
mother, you got off on a technicality.

15:50.773 --> 15:54.049
Now the woman next door
turns up dead from a blow to the head.

15:54.213 --> 15:56.568
What could possibly make them
think of you?

15:56.733 --> 15:58.485
- Should I talk to them?
- I wouldn't.

15:58.653 --> 16:01.326
Where you once were convincing
you now are anything but.

16:01.813 --> 16:04.247
I don't like it when you speak to me
in hurtful tones.

16:04.413 --> 16:07.132
- I am not an evil person.
- Yes, you are, Bernie.

16:07.293 --> 16:09.249
You've killed two people
inside of a week.

16:09.413 --> 16:11.131
By definition, that makes you evil.

16:11.293 --> 16:13.488
This last killing was premeditated,
calculated.

16:13.653 --> 16:17.885
You went over there, as you said,
to dispatch a human being.

16:18.053 --> 16:21.602
You're a little bug, and like a bug,
you will one day get stepped on.

16:22.053 --> 16:25.648
Now, go away.
I do not represent evil people.

16:28.413 --> 16:29.687
I asked you to leave.

16:30.253 --> 16:31.652
May I say one more thing?

16:32.813 --> 16:37.364
You cut me to the quick.
I am a bug.

16:37.693 --> 16:41.971
My mother would often tell me
I am nothing more...

16:42.133 --> 16:44.522
...than an insignificant little...

16:44.693 --> 16:47.207
She used to call me a dung beetle.

16:47.933 --> 16:50.527
When I killed her,
as she lay on the floor...

16:51.093 --> 16:54.369
...for the first time, I felt alive.

16:54.653 --> 16:57.451
I had actually done something.

16:58.613 --> 17:01.810
Perhaps a part of me
sought to relive that power.

17:01.973 --> 17:05.045
But today, I do, I feel evil.

17:07.093 --> 17:08.890
I need your help, Alan.

17:09.053 --> 17:12.932
The police want to interrogate me.
I don't know what to do.

17:13.093 --> 17:15.766
- Could l...? Oh, I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.

17:15.933 --> 17:17.685
Tara Wilson, meet Bernard Ferrion.

17:17.853 --> 17:20.446
He kills people with cookware.
Allegedly, of course.

17:20.613 --> 17:24.162
- Bernie, Tara. She's your new lawyer.
- No, I prefer you.

17:24.333 --> 17:27.882
No, you can't have me.
One reason being I know too much.

17:28.053 --> 17:31.443
If you want this firm to help you,
Tara's your lawyer.

17:31.613 --> 17:34.446
She's very fetching, but is she good?

17:37.093 --> 17:38.526
The police want to talk to him.

17:38.693 --> 17:42.129
There's an excellent chance you can avoid
the prison term he deserves.

17:42.293 --> 17:45.808
I must warn you,
do not come to care for this man.

17:45.973 --> 17:47.565
He will let you down.

17:49.373 --> 17:50.408
That's all.

17:55.093 --> 17:57.004
Let's go, Mr. Ferrion.

18:10.853 --> 18:13.606
Nora, when you get a minute.

18:14.813 --> 18:15.848
[SIGHS]

18:19.533 --> 18:22.047
Why did you feel compelled
to speak to Shirley Schmidt?

18:22.213 --> 18:24.681
- Why didn't you take it up with me?
NORA: I don't know.

18:24.853 --> 18:26.491
I suppose...

18:28.533 --> 18:30.842
I guess I didn't feel
I could hold my own with you.

18:31.853 --> 18:33.730
Which, I guess,
is a part of the problem.

18:33.893 --> 18:35.804
"Alan, I'm uncomfortable
with the banter."

18:35.973 --> 18:38.726
You could've said that.
You did participate in the banter.

18:38.893 --> 18:40.724
I participated.

18:40.893 --> 18:43.566
I of course wanted
to be liked by my boss.

18:44.613 --> 18:46.604
But then...

18:46.973 --> 18:48.486
...it started to go too far.

18:48.653 --> 18:50.644
And when it went too far,
why not tell me?

18:51.733 --> 18:53.007
I don't know.

18:54.293 --> 18:58.172
Because I had let it go on.
I felt maybe I'd gotten myself in...

19:01.773 --> 19:04.003
At the seminars,
you get the impression...

19:04.173 --> 19:07.802
...that the senior people here
are good at dealing with these things.

19:07.973 --> 19:09.167
I wanted you to stop...

19:09.333 --> 19:11.642
...but I still like you
and like working for you...

19:11.813 --> 19:15.010
...and I was hoping they maybe
had a way to solve the problem...

19:15.173 --> 19:16.925
...without any hurt feelings.

19:23.133 --> 19:24.566
So, what happens now?

19:27.613 --> 19:30.685
FIFE:
We actually call it "intelligent design."

19:30.853 --> 19:33.925
Basically, the idea is
life is so complex...

19:34.093 --> 19:37.642
...a greater power has to be at play.
- The greater power being God?

19:37.813 --> 19:39.769
FIFE: We're by no means...
- Denny!

19:39.933 --> 19:41.286
...shutting down Darwinism...

19:41.453 --> 19:43.648
...or suggesting that evolution
is inaccurate.

19:43.813 --> 19:45.565
Do you believe in evolution, Mr. Fife?

19:45.733 --> 19:47.963
I happen to believe in both God
and evolution.

19:48.453 --> 19:50.842
I don't think the two
have to be mutually exclusive.

19:51.013 --> 19:54.164
So why not offer the intelligent-design
theory in religion courses?

19:54.333 --> 19:56.972
- Why science?
FIFE: We thought hard about that.

19:57.133 --> 20:00.762
But the simple truth is
more and more scientists...

20:00.933 --> 20:03.401
Scientists, not theologians.

20:03.693 --> 20:07.288
- Have said that when you examine
the intricacies of the human cell...

20:07.453 --> 20:10.172
...the mathematical equations
of DNA...

20:10.333 --> 20:15.691
...you simply cannot conclude that
it's all explained by natural selection.

20:15.853 --> 20:18.526
Another power has to be at work.

20:18.693 --> 20:19.967
God.

20:20.133 --> 20:22.089
Well, again,
we never mention him by name.

20:22.493 --> 20:24.802
You're aware of the separation
of Church and State?

20:25.253 --> 20:27.687
- I'm aware.
- This is boring crap.

20:27.853 --> 20:29.491
GELLMAN:
And you're also aware, Mr. Fife...

20:29.653 --> 20:32.167
...the Supreme Court has banned
teaching creationism?

20:32.333 --> 20:34.767
As I said,
we're not calling it creationism.

20:34.933 --> 20:37.208
But you admitted
that's what's going on.

20:37.373 --> 20:41.969
And creationism holds that God created
the world 6000 years ago in six days.

20:42.133 --> 20:43.122
That's not my view.

20:43.293 --> 20:45.602
GELLMAN: But it's the view you insist
your teachers explain.

20:45.773 --> 20:48.333
- As a theory.
- A theory with no scientific basis...

20:48.493 --> 20:51.610
...other than to say,
"Gee, evolution can't account for it all."

21:00.573 --> 21:02.484
- Why the helmet?
- It wouldn't be for here.

21:02.653 --> 21:03.927
It would be for at home.

21:04.093 --> 21:07.688
Well, the thinking being, if there's
somebody breaking into houses...

21:07.853 --> 21:11.129
...whacking people from behind
on the head...

21:11.293 --> 21:13.090
...it would make sense
to wear a helmet.

21:13.293 --> 21:16.922
- I want to exude innocence, you see?
- Get rid of the helmet.

21:17.493 --> 21:20.803
But Ms. Wilson, at my core,
I'm a little man.

21:20.973 --> 21:24.852
It would make sense for me
to want to protect myself, right?

21:26.373 --> 21:28.648
Get rid of the helmet.
You look ridiculous.

21:28.813 --> 21:29.848
Now, listen to me.

21:30.013 --> 21:32.846
The police have asked for a DNA sample,
and I'm gonna agree.

21:33.013 --> 21:34.287
What? Why on earth?

21:34.453 --> 21:37.013
Because they could get one
with a court order.

21:37.173 --> 21:39.528
What about my right
to not incriminate myself?

21:39.693 --> 21:44.244
Cooperation goes a long way towards
exuding innocence, Mr. Ferrion.

21:44.413 --> 21:46.483
Much better than hockey headgear.

21:46.653 --> 21:50.532
You know, everyone is speaking to me
in hurtful tones, and I don't appreciate it.

21:51.733 --> 21:53.883
I did kill people.

21:54.053 --> 21:58.808
You'd think I'd incur a little shock
and awe, if not respect.

21:58.973 --> 22:01.726
Is that why you did this?
To inspire awe?

22:04.533 --> 22:08.492
Alan Shore told me that your mother
referred to you as a dung beetle.

22:08.893 --> 22:11.453
Please don't mention that
particular species to me.

22:13.613 --> 22:18.607
I don't know what else Alan told you,
but I'm a kind man.

22:19.093 --> 22:21.687
I have admittedly committed
two heinous acts.

22:21.853 --> 22:24.572
But the first was not voluntary...

22:24.733 --> 22:26.644
...and the second was
out of desperation...

22:26.813 --> 22:28.371
...not wanting to go to prison...

22:28.533 --> 22:31.093
...where bigger men will
have their way with me.

22:32.653 --> 22:35.121
Ms. Wilson, I need your help.

22:36.853 --> 22:39.572
Please be on my side.

22:49.933 --> 22:51.651
I'm sorry.

22:54.013 --> 22:56.208
That remark was way out of line.

23:01.093 --> 23:05.291
Listen, Sally, it didn't help that you
were with me a year and a half ago...

23:05.453 --> 23:08.968
...and then you were with Alan Shore.
It's gossip. It travels fast.

23:09.773 --> 23:15.723
But I have no doubt, none, that you are
going to be an exceptional attorney.

23:16.293 --> 23:18.090
But just not here.

23:19.093 --> 23:21.971
They're never gonna give you
the chance.

23:22.133 --> 23:23.361
You need to...

23:24.813 --> 23:26.212
...remake yourself.

23:27.533 --> 23:29.842
Start fresh.

23:32.293 --> 23:34.853
You asked me for help...

23:35.013 --> 23:39.006
...and I'm going to provide it to you
in the form of advice.

23:42.413 --> 23:44.165
You need to go.

24:16.133 --> 24:18.886
At the beginning of the year,
we got word at our assembly...

24:19.053 --> 24:22.090
...that moral values would be one
of our educational objectives.

24:22.253 --> 24:23.527
Which was fine.

24:23.693 --> 24:26.048
But to have evolution bumped
for creationism...

24:26.213 --> 24:30.092
To be fair, evolution isn't being displaced,
creationism is just being included.

24:30.453 --> 24:32.728
Evolution is a tough subject matter.

24:32.893 --> 24:37.205
We cannot cut into what little class time
we have to service a political agenda.

24:37.373 --> 24:39.091
- To teach...
- Objection. Nonresponsive.

24:39.253 --> 24:41.528
Please limit your answers
to the questions, ma'am.

24:43.053 --> 24:45.965
Why can't you view intelligent
design as a science, Ms. Turner?

24:46.133 --> 24:50.445
Because there is simply no
scientific data to support it.

24:50.613 --> 24:55.528
How are we to maintain any credibility
as science teachers if we say:

24:55.693 --> 24:59.606
"Gee, despite all this data,
there's also another possibility."

25:00.013 --> 25:03.369
Intelligent design makes
a mockery of science.

25:03.533 --> 25:06.047
If you want to teach it
as a religion course, fine.

25:06.213 --> 25:09.171
But as a science
it's simply preposterous.

25:10.653 --> 25:12.848
I don't understand why
he wouldn't want to talk.

25:13.013 --> 25:16.892
- Lf a killer is loose in his neighborhood...
- He'd love to talk. I'm not letting him.

25:17.053 --> 25:18.930
- I'll tell you one thing...
- Bernard.

25:19.093 --> 25:21.891
You people wrongly arrested
him last time with no evidence...

25:22.053 --> 25:24.328
...after his mother recklessly
accused him.

25:24.493 --> 25:26.723

It's about getting religion

Creationism is religious doctrine.
It is not supported by scientific data.

of creationism in the public schools.

30:13.253 --> 30:14.971
My client's discharge was unlawful...

of separating Church and State.

30:20.173 --> 30:22.846
Of course we have
a legitimate cause of action.

30:29.893 --> 30:31.451
That was almost evangelical.

30:36.693 --> 30:39.366

the notion of a higher power.

as a possible theory...

30:56.813 --> 30:59.850

might have also played a part?

I don't know.

40:09.733 --> 40:11.564
You believe in a higher power, right?

40:11.773 --> 40:14.810
That wasn't just advocacy
in that room?

40:14.973 --> 40:17.726
With what's going on in the world,
I need to believe.

40:18.453 --> 40:20.284
But...

40:20.813 --> 40:22.769
But what?

40:23.893 --> 40:29.843
God forbid the next court says it's
okay to ban evolution from the schools.

40:33.093 --> 40:36.972
Yeah. God forbid.

40:54.933 --> 40:56.207
