00:14.280 --> 00:15.350
Ma'am.

00:16.560 --> 00:19.632
Lyra, this is your new home.

00:24.760 --> 00:26.592
Is this all yours?

00:26.720 --> 00:28.040
Goodness, no.

00:28.160 --> 00:30.390
Just the one floor.

00:30.520 --> 00:32.636
(LIFT BELL DINGS)

00:34.280 --> 00:35.600
Go on.

00:36.760 --> 00:39.149
I can't believe this is our new home, Pan.

00:39.280 --> 00:41.191
Look how shiny the floor is!

00:50.880 --> 00:53.190
Right, let me show you around.

00:53.320 --> 00:56.073
This is the living room.

00:56.200 --> 00:57.713
Wow!

00:57.840 --> 00:59.717
The terrace.

00:59.840 --> 01:02.878
Now, up here is my bedroom.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.037
And that's my study,

01:05.160 --> 01:08.949
which I'd rather
stayed my private space.

01:09.080 --> 01:13.313
And then here is the room
I prepared for you.

01:14.920 --> 01:16.513
I'll let you get settled.

01:20.400 --> 01:22.676
(BOTH LAUGH)

01:22.800 --> 01:24.473
Oh, I'm drowning!

01:26.160 --> 01:28.151
(MUFFLED) I'm drowning.

01:28.280 --> 01:30.430
It is a lot more comfortable than Oxford.

01:30.560 --> 01:33.120
And it's our new home.

01:33.240 --> 01:35.197
Roger's too...

01:35.320 --> 01:36.754
...when she finds him.

01:37.920 --> 01:39.479
A home for us all.

01:52.560 --> 01:54.198
(DOOR CLOSES)

01:54.320 --> 01:56.072
Billy?

01:56.200 --> 01:57.395
Roger!

01:57.520 --> 01:59.431
Billy Costa!

03:35.600 --> 03:37.750
How are you with heights?

03:37.880 --> 03:39.473
They don't scare me.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.431
Never have.

03:42.560 --> 03:45.029
I used to live on the roof
of Jordan College.

03:45.160 --> 03:47.913
I slept out there every other Sunday.

03:48.040 --> 03:49.189
No, you didn't,

03:49.320 --> 03:50.549
I did!

03:56.120 --> 03:57.474
Roger was there too.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.796
On the roof.

03:59.920 --> 04:01.957
I've got my best people looking for him.

04:02.080 --> 04:05.596
We'll find him, Lyra. Soon.

04:10.880 --> 04:12.518
I've never been sure about them.

04:12.640 --> 04:14.153
Heights.

04:15.800 --> 04:19.589
I could never get away
from the occasional urge to jump.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.915
Right, let's get to it.

04:29.040 --> 04:31.190
Plenty to do before we lunch
at the Arctic Institute.

04:31.320 --> 04:33.436
We're lunching at the Arctic Institute?

04:33.560 --> 04:35.836
Yes, of course we are. Now, chop chop.

04:35.960 --> 04:39.635
Plans to make, clothes to get,
lots to do. Come on.

04:50.160 --> 04:52.151
Wow!

04:54.440 --> 04:56.750
Is that the Skraeling

04:56.880 --> 04:59.713
who mapped the currents
of the Great Northern Ocean?

04:59.840 --> 05:01.433
Hello, Eliza.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.233
- (DOG WHINES)
- You know him?

05:03.360 --> 05:05.829
Of course. Now come, Lyra.

05:09.480 --> 05:12.916
Oxford only had so much, but this...

05:14.600 --> 05:16.955
Now, what will you eat?

05:17.080 --> 05:18.798
I don't care about food.

05:18.920 --> 05:20.911
Well, you might care about food
if you were starving.

05:21.040 --> 05:24.874
Is that an armoured bear skull?
I've heard so much about them!

05:25.000 --> 05:25.796
Lyra.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.035
- It's huge.
- Lyra!

05:28.440 --> 05:30.238
Sit down.

05:33.160 --> 05:34.480
- Sweetbreads.
- Oh!

05:34.600 --> 05:37.399
- Courtesy of the chef, Mrs Coulter.
- Thank him.

05:41.320 --> 05:43.596
Mrs Coulter,
I've been thinking about Roger,

05:43.720 --> 05:46.030
and I think I should help you
with the search.

05:46.160 --> 05:47.753
Like you said in Jordan -

05:47.880 --> 05:51.077
child's eyes...useful.

05:51.200 --> 05:53.919
Lyra, look around this room.

05:54.040 --> 05:56.156
How many women do you see?

05:57.440 --> 06:00.239
In every room, there are those
that would belittle you.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.591
With my help,
they won't lay a scratch on you.

06:03.720 --> 06:06.712
For you will have knowledge
that they won't.

06:06.840 --> 06:10.151
I can teach you to wield power
over all of them,

06:10.280 --> 06:13.477
but you must let me mould you.

06:13.600 --> 06:15.955
You must trust me.

06:16.080 --> 06:18.356
I trust you.

06:18.480 --> 06:20.790
Then will you let me find Roger for you?

06:20.920 --> 06:24.356
- He's my best friend.
- Lyra, I won't let you down.

06:28.800 --> 06:30.598
- All right.
- Good.

06:30.720 --> 06:34.873
Now, who do you want to be
introduced to first?

06:35.000 --> 06:38.595
A van has been seen leaving
and entering here.

06:38.720 --> 06:41.030
We've not confirmed children on board.

06:41.160 --> 06:43.515
We've not confirmed?
We need to be confirmed.

06:43.640 --> 06:46.837
The Gobblers are efficient,
well protected and well funded.

06:46.960 --> 06:48.951
They're so good,
people think they're a myth.

06:49.080 --> 06:51.276
So you're saying we know enough?

06:51.400 --> 06:53.038
I'd state good odds that the van
is Gobbler

06:53.160 --> 06:54.912
and it's being used to transport them.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.554
We've been searching for days.
This is the best lead we've got.

06:57.680 --> 07:01.514
So tomorrow we attack. In the morning,
we gather our best men.

07:01.640 --> 07:03.074
Go in fast through the front door.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.589
Take on whatever lies on the other side.

07:05.720 --> 07:08.360
Prepare the men. We strike with force.

07:11.760 --> 07:13.956
(MRS COULTER GIGGLES)

07:16.160 --> 07:19.278
Have you ever considered doing
something different with your hair?

07:19.400 --> 07:21.357
I like my hair.

07:21.480 --> 07:24.598
No, I don't think
it accentuates your face.

07:27.200 --> 07:28.838
Maybe I should grow it.

07:28.960 --> 07:30.280
I had long hair.

07:30.400 --> 07:32.357
That was really useful.

07:32.480 --> 07:36.075
Like, this one time when Roger and I
were caught in this grain silo,

07:36.200 --> 07:38.396
we turned my hair into a rope,

07:38.520 --> 07:41.956
he climbed up me and out,
and then pulled me out.

07:42.080 --> 07:43.400
Lyra, please don't lie to me.

07:43.520 --> 07:44.919
- I wasn't.
- Yes, you were.

07:48.920 --> 07:50.399
Lyra...

07:51.640 --> 07:53.711
...] think you can be extraordinary.

07:55.520 --> 07:58.160
But being extraordinary takes application.

07:58.280 --> 08:00.749
It means being prepared to change.

08:01.960 --> 08:03.837
And that takes guidance.

08:03.960 --> 08:05.155
Hmm?

08:10.240 --> 08:12.880
We shouldn't change
just so we can fit in here.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.152
She's being very kind to us, Pan.

08:23.800 --> 08:25.313
She's nice.

08:26.880 --> 08:28.598
She treats me nice.

08:29.640 --> 08:32.472
Don't we deserve to have nice things?

08:32.600 --> 08:33.874
For once?

08:34.000 --> 08:35.479
Of course we do.

08:36.799 --> 08:39.871
No-one's ever said I could be
extraordinary before.

09:10.880 --> 09:12.359
(CLANGING)

09:12.480 --> 09:14.312
(WHISPERS) Lyra.

09:14.440 --> 09:15.999
Lyra.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.758
Mmm... What?

09:17.880 --> 09:19.314
Lyra, wake up.

09:19.440 --> 09:21.078
Listen to that noise.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.793
What is it?

09:22.920 --> 09:25.560
It's just the pipes, Pan. It's fine.

09:25.680 --> 09:27.000
It's something.

09:27.120 --> 09:28.519
Listen.

09:28.640 --> 09:30.472
It's nothing.

09:30.600 --> 09:33.353
I don't think it's the pipes.

09:34.920 --> 09:36.718
Hey, stop.

09:57.960 --> 10:01.954
Stop at nothing.
We will rescue these children.

10:05.720 --> 10:06.915
Come on!

10:10.120 --> 10:11.474
We're in, sir.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.039
That's Billy's.

10:52.800 --> 10:56.395
This proves they were here.

10:59.040 --> 11:02.476
The Gobblers must have known
we were coming and moved them.

11:04.960 --> 11:06.951
What do they want the children for?

11:12.880 --> 11:14.154
You see anything?

11:14.280 --> 11:15.873
No, nothing.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.399
Just a brick wall.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.191
BILLY: I miss my ma.

11:28.640 --> 11:30.631
I don't have a ma to miss.

11:32.880 --> 11:34.712
My aunt brought me up for a bit.

11:34.840 --> 11:39.232
And then she found a good job for me
in Jordan College.

11:40.480 --> 11:42.039
And then I met Lyra.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.720
I know she won't leave us here.

11:44.840 --> 11:47.559
She'll be looking for us right now.

11:48.720 --> 11:50.358
Wherever she is.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.073
I will be having a party for a few friends
and fellow explorers

11:56.200 --> 11:59.670
and, Lyra, I'll need your help
serving drinks.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.154
Stop.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.476
That's it. Perfect.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.989
There ain't much give in it.

12:06.120 --> 12:08.111
I like running around, you know?

12:08.240 --> 12:11.437
The clothes you wear
determine the way people see you.

12:11.560 --> 12:14.393
Now come, look in the mirror.

12:19.480 --> 12:20.914
I like it...

12:21.960 --> 12:22.950
...I think.

12:23.080 --> 12:24.753
Blue is quite your colour.

12:24.880 --> 12:26.075
Did you know that?

12:26.200 --> 12:28.271
I didn't know I had a colour at all.

12:33.280 --> 12:35.351
It'll allow me to wield power.

12:35.480 --> 12:38.916
Looks like it'll allow you
to wield a cake knife.

12:39.040 --> 12:40.439
(GIGGLES)

12:43.400 --> 12:45.710
If my uncle could see me like this...

12:45.840 --> 12:49.231
Oh, he'd be delighted...I'm sure.

13:08.800 --> 13:12.680
I heard your request,
and I'm unable to grant it.

13:12.800 --> 13:16.589
I simply ask to examine what remains
of the head Asriel presented to you

13:16.720 --> 13:18.870
before it's treated
and placed in your crypt.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.718
Grumman was a scholar of this college.

13:20.840 --> 13:25.073
Word is, you've already allowed his head
to be thawed and treated.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.476
Vital information might have been lost.

13:28.720 --> 13:31.394
Boreal, as you are aware,

13:31.520 --> 13:34.831
scholastic sanctuary...

13:34.960 --> 13:37.429
As an executive of the Consistorial Court,

13:37.560 --> 13:40.234
I must understand where he's been.

13:41.960 --> 13:45.032
They say that he crossed
between the worlds.

13:45.160 --> 13:46.673
That's heresy.

13:46.800 --> 13:49.553
That's an interesting word
for you to use,

13:49.680 --> 13:52.399
especially considering
what I've heard of Asriel's visit

13:52.520 --> 13:53.840
to this college.

13:53.960 --> 13:56.873
Is it true he spoke of Dust,

13:57.000 --> 14:01.153
and that you're funding
his investigations?

14:03.720 --> 14:05.233
Whatever you're threatening...

14:05.360 --> 14:08.113
- (BIRD CAWS)
- I threaten nothing.

14:11.240 --> 14:13.231
What do you hide?

14:13.360 --> 14:16.512
The only rights the Magisterium has here

14:16.640 --> 14:18.438
are the rights I grant it.

14:18.560 --> 14:20.915
His skull is in our crypt.

14:21.040 --> 14:22.758
It will stay there,

14:22.880 --> 14:24.871
as is his right

14:25.000 --> 14:27.310
and our responsibility.

14:27.440 --> 14:28.760
Of course...

14:29.760 --> 14:30.955
...Master.

14:40.800 --> 14:43.155
Lyra, you're still not concentrating.

14:46.480 --> 14:48.118
Books aren't what I'm best at.

14:48.240 --> 14:50.231
And what are you best at?

14:50.360 --> 14:56.038
Can't you mould me into someone
who...reads some books,

14:56.160 --> 14:58.470
but who travels mostly?

14:58.600 --> 15:01.353
Who adventures?

15:01.480 --> 15:03.915
Who looks for people when they're lost?

15:04.040 --> 15:06.156
Lyra, did you not agree to trust me?

15:07.360 --> 15:09.795
Now, where were you?

15:09.920 --> 15:11.672
Yes. Electrons.

15:11.800 --> 15:14.440
Now, the thing about electrons
is that they are...

15:14.560 --> 15:17.837
They are negatively charged particles,
sort of like Dust,

15:17.960 --> 15:19.519
but Dust might not be charged.

15:19.640 --> 15:21.153
(GROWLS)

15:22.480 --> 15:23.754
Dust?

15:23.880 --> 15:25.996
You know, from-space Dust.

15:26.120 --> 15:27.872
That Dust.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.594
You see, I do know some things.

15:30.720 --> 15:32.313
What do you know about Dust, Lyra?

15:32.440 --> 15:35.319
It comes from space.
It lights people up if you have...

15:35.440 --> 15:37.556
- (GROWLS)
- ...a special camera to see it by.

15:37.680 --> 15:39.717
And...

15:39.840 --> 15:41.353
Ah, yes.

15:41.480 --> 15:43.232
It doesn't affect children.

15:44.320 --> 15:46.516
Who did you learn this from?

15:50.040 --> 15:53.271
Just a visiting scholar from
New Denmark who came to Jordan.

15:53.400 --> 15:56.916
He was talking to the chaplain,
and I was passing by.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.714
I couldn't help but listen.

16:00.720 --> 16:02.472
Hmm.

16:02.600 --> 16:03.670
Is it right?

16:03.800 --> 16:05.313
Will you tell me?

16:05.440 --> 16:09.035
Well, I'm sure you know
much more about it than I do.

16:11.280 --> 16:14.716
Now, let's get back
to these electrons, hmm?

16:19.800 --> 16:21.393
- (CROCKERY SMASHES)
- MA: Damn it!

16:25.480 --> 16:26.834
Ma, I'll clean lit.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.678
- No, you won't.
- I want to help.

16:28.800 --> 16:30.598
Next time they go out.

16:30.720 --> 16:32.518
The answer is no, Tony!

16:32.640 --> 16:34.631
(FOOTSTEPS)

16:46.040 --> 16:48.316
- Can I help?
- You can find my son!

16:48.440 --> 16:51.990
We were so close, though, Maggie.
If you would have seen...

16:52.120 --> 16:54.873
We never should have left Oxford.
He's probably still there,

16:55.000 --> 16:57.913
lost, looking for his ma.

16:58.040 --> 16:59.189
He's not in Oxford.

16:59.320 --> 17:01.072
