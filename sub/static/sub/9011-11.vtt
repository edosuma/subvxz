- MORTY: Drive carefully!

00:02.628 --> 00:03.795
Have fun, you two.

00:03.879 --> 00:06.464
Yes, we will have as
much fun as possible on our...

00:06.548 --> 00:08.591
Titanic-themed getaway.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.468
Let's lose the 'tude, please.

00:10.552 --> 00:12.261
It's supposed to be romantic.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.586
Speaking of disasters, Dad,
we are leaving you in charge.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.265
I know, c-can we wrap
this up?

00:16.350 --> 00:18.601

synthetic laser eels

00:18.686 --> 00:19.811

00:19.895 --> 00:21.479
Hey, don't blow me off.

00:21.563 --> 00:23.314
I am drawing a line, okay?

00:23.399 --> 00:25.525
Any damage to this house
or these children

00:25.609 --> 00:27.568
when we get back, and...

00:27.653 --> 00:29.612
n-no more
adventures with Morty.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.781
Aw, geez, Rick, if my mom's
the one saying it,

00:31.865 --> 00:33.783
then you know it's pretty
serious this time.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.326
- BOTH: That's right.
- Wait. What?

00:35.411 --> 00:37.328
Listen, you have
my word as a caregiver,

00:37.413 --> 00:39.247
everything's gonna be fine.

00:39.331 --> 00:41.958
And if not, like you say, no
more adventures or whatever.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.751
It's like that old song

00:43.836 --> 00:45.795
"Blomp Blomp-a Noop Noop
A-Noop Noop Noop."

00:45.879 --> 00:48.047
Y-You guys know that song?
From Tiny Rogerts?

00:48.132 --> 00:49.632
You never heard of it?

00:49.717 --> 00:52.093
You know, the black effeminate
guy from the '50s?

00:52.177 --> 00:53.594
No-Nobody?

00:53.679 --> 00:55.638
A-All right, whatever.
Look, who cares?

00:55.723 --> 00:57.765
Just go on your stupid trip.

00:57.850 --> 01:00.184
Not one thing out of place.

Well, we're past
the point of no return.

01:18.495 --> 01:19.871
I'm going to have a party.

01:51.779 --> 01:54.405
SUMMER: I found jello. Can you
sneak your mom's vodka?

01:54.490 --> 01:56.741
Yes, she does.
I saw it in your laundry room.

01:56.825 --> 01:59.577
Listen, you can't both be
in denial about it.

01:59.661 --> 02:01.245
Okay, bye.
- Summer!

02:01.330 --> 02:03.372
You can't throw a party!
Remember what mom said?

02:03.457 --> 02:04.832
Yeah, if anything
gets messed up,

02:04.917 --> 02:06.237
you and Grandpa Rick get
punished.

02:06.293 --> 02:07.493
I'm only a human being, Morty.

02:07.503 --> 02:09.462
Rick, tell Summer
she can't have a party!

02:09.546 --> 02:11.380
Uh, Summer, you can't
have a party.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.049
- [ scoffs ]
- Because [burps]

02:13.133 --> 02:14.717
I'm having
a party, b-i-i-i-itch!

02:14.802 --> 02:16.594
Oh, what?!
Rick, you can't!

02:16.678 --> 02:18.638
What do you mean
you're having a party?

02:18.722 --> 02:20.681
Are some Glip Glops
from the third dimension

02:20.766 --> 02:22.809
going to come over
and play cards or something?

02:22.893 --> 02:24.018
"Glip Glop?"

02:24.102 --> 02:25.686
You're lucky a Traflorkian
doesn't hear you say that.

02:25.771 --> 02:27.313
Is that like their
N-word?

02:27.397 --> 02:28.981
It's like the N-word
and the C-word had a baby

02:29.066 --> 02:30.983
and it was raised by
all the bad words for Jews.

02:31.068 --> 02:32.860
Listen, I think the
three of us could just,

02:32.945 --> 02:34.779
you know, have a nice
time, like, just hanging out,

02:34.863 --> 02:36.583
and, you know, doing
a little bonding and...

02:36.657 --> 02:38.324
Screw that.
This is my chance...

02:38.408 --> 02:40.159
to gain some footing
with the cool kids.

02:40.244 --> 02:42.620
That's why you party?
Boy, you really are 17.

02:42.704 --> 02:44.789
- Why do you party?
- To get [burps]...

02:44.873 --> 02:46.958

02:47.042 --> 02:49.836
Just keep your sci-fi friends
away from my awesome ones.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.129
Yeah, and you keep your
awesome friends away

02:52.214 --> 02:54.507
from my canapes.

02:54.591 --> 02:57.635
After dinner, Titanic2will
attach to the rail system

02:57.719 --> 02:59.011
near our replica iceberg,

02:59.096 --> 03:00.888
and the hydraulics
encased in these tubes

03:00.973 --> 03:03.724
will execute a controlled sink
into the icy depths.

03:03.809 --> 03:05.768
A rail system seems archaic

03:05.853 --> 03:08.354
for an attraction this
impressive.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.231
Are you sure the ship will sink?

03:10.315 --> 03:11.899
I can assure you the ship
will sink,

03:11.984 --> 03:13.818
as it has a thousand
times before.

03:13.902 --> 03:17.530
It is UN-unsinkable.
- Ooh!

03:17.614 --> 03:19.782
Look, it's the line for the bow!

03:19.867 --> 03:21.659
Jerry, I'd love to just
kick back

03:21.743 --> 03:23.494
with a margarita and read.

03:23.579 --> 03:25.454
Do you mind if I skip the whole
"King of the World" bit?

03:25.539 --> 03:27.540
Well, it's not
the "King of the World" bit.

03:27.624 --> 03:28.791
That's Jack and Fabrizio.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.085
This is where Rose says,
"I'm flying, Jack!"

03:31.169 --> 03:32.503
But whatever.

03:32.588 --> 03:33.713
I can be the only one
to do it alone.

03:33.797 --> 03:35.882
Well, what about her?
Excuse me, ma'am.

03:35.966 --> 03:37.967
Would you like to take

into trouble.

We won't tell.

03:42.222 --> 03:45.266
So...
you're a Titanic fanatic?

03:45.350 --> 03:47.602
Oh, yes. I've worked here
since it opened,

03:47.686 --> 03:49.812
but I've never been able
to participate.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.731

personally would ever do it...

- Yo.

Brad is here! Quick, make
my hair look drunk.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.785
Check it out.
Tammy's already drunk.

04:04.870 --> 04:07.496
Cool.

Oh, there's an emergency,
all right.

When's the last time
you got laid, 'Pers?

mating season for Birdperson.

The thing people don't
realize about the gear wars

05:15.023 --> 05:18.234
is that it was never really
about the gears at all.

No, no, to-totally.
