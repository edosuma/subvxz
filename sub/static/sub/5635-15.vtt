00:23.411 --> 00:25.161
Why can't land lines
have funky ringtones?

00:25.247 --> 00:26.614
I kind of like the ring.

00:26.615 --> 00:27.748

Ring...

00:27.749 --> 00:29.166
It's classic.

00:29.167 --> 00:30.667
Bob's Burgers.
Yes, this is Bob.

00:30.752 --> 00:32.336
Hey, Warren Fitzgerald?

00:32.337 --> 00:34.338
How's it going?
Long time no talk!

00:34.339 --> 00:35.756
Warren Fitzgerald?

00:35.757 --> 00:37.541
Dad's childhood friend
who got rich?

00:37.542 --> 00:39.510
Uh, Dad's childhood friend
who got super rich.

00:39.511 --> 00:41.295
He's actually real?

00:41.296 --> 00:42.630
I thought that was
Dad's alter ego,

00:42.631 --> 00:44.098
like in Fight Club.

00:44.099 --> 00:46.016
Kids, shush.
Uh, what were you saying?

00:46.017 --> 00:47.635
Oh, Warren Fitzgerald is real.

00:47.636 --> 00:49.053
He's, like, ten feet tall,

00:49.054 --> 00:50.804
or maybe I was just
really young when I met him.

00:50.805 --> 00:52.306
No, he might be that tall.

00:52.307 --> 00:53.641
He can afford extra leg.

00:53.642 --> 00:55.391
And all the toes he wants!

00:55.477 --> 00:56.727
Great, talk to you soon.

00:56.728 --> 00:58.812
So, how's the richest
man you know?

00:58.813 --> 01:01.314
Wait, are you
the poorest man he knows?

01:01.366 --> 01:02.700
Probably. But he's great.

01:02.701 --> 01:04.318
And he's gonna be in town,

01:04.319 --> 01:06.069
and he wants to come
stay with us this weekend.

01:06.154 --> 01:07.655
Is that okay?

01:07.656 --> 01:09.156
Of course.
He's your only friend.

01:09.157 --> 01:10.541
I mean, your oldest friend.

01:10.542 --> 01:12.543
Good, because I kind of
already told him he could.

01:12.544 --> 01:13.826
This is gonna be fun.

01:13.912 --> 01:16.080
Dad, you are positively giddy.

01:16.081 --> 01:18.131
Yeah, you're glowing.
Are you pregnant?

the guy in high school.

01:22.087 --> 01:24.470

the leader of our little group.

01:24.506 --> 01:26.507
Oh, that must have been
a tough job to get.

01:26.508 --> 01:28.225
Was he the Fonz?

01:28.226 --> 01:31.011
He made the Fonz look
like Potsie. ‭Whoa.

01:31.012 --> 01:33.097
That's great.
But he wants to stay with us?

01:33.098 --> 01:34.397
Why not stay at a nice hotel?

01:34.482 --> 01:36.934
Or buy a nice hotel?
‭Yeah.

01:36.935 --> 01:39.069
I, you know, I think
he really wants to reconnect.

01:39.070 --> 01:40.738
And... and get to know
you guys, right?

01:40.739 --> 01:42.690
Get the full Belcher experience.

01:42.691 --> 01:44.741
Ew.
‭Right, we are disgusting.

01:44.826 --> 01:46.777
So let's not make Warren
sleep on the couch.

01:46.778 --> 01:48.746

to give up your room.

01:48.747 --> 01:50.614
Not it! ‭Not it! ‭Ah! Darn.

Yeah.
You want to get involved,

01:54.202 --> 01:55.368

01:55.453 --> 01:56.787
No, you're good.

01:56.788 --> 01:58.739
Yeah.
‭Mm...

to sleep in my room, Gene?

02:02.427 --> 02:03.927
Uh, this window by the street

02:03.928 --> 02:05.713
will be a little quieter
than your room.

02:05.714 --> 02:07.714
I guess I've been talking
in my sleep a little lately.

02:07.799 --> 02:09.015
More like yelling.

02:09.017 --> 02:11.385
It's like a poetry slam
in there.

02:11.386 --> 02:12.886
Mm... I can make this work.

02:12.887 --> 02:16.273
I hereby declare this
nook New Geneland!

02:16.274 --> 02:18.642
Our primary export
is natural gas!

02:18.643 --> 02:19.777
And Fiats.

02:19.778 --> 02:21.695
Oh, Warren's here.

02:21.696 --> 02:23.731
Hey, we should dump a cup of
water out the window on him.

02:23.732 --> 02:25.616
We used to do that to
each other all the time.

02:25.617 --> 02:27.116
On it!
(panting)

02:27.202 --> 02:29.353
So that's life before
the Internet, huh?

02:30.955 --> 02:32.822
What the... My watch!

02:32.907 --> 02:34.074
It's ruined!

02:34.075 --> 02:35.542
Oh, no!

02:35.543 --> 02:37.161
My grandfather
gave me this watch!

02:37.162 --> 02:39.463
Uh-oh.
‭Oh, crap! I'm sorry!

02:39.464 --> 02:40.831
Oh, my God. Sorry!

02:40.832 --> 02:43.083
(laughing): Bob! Gotcha!

02:43.084 --> 02:44.334
I don't even have a watch.

02:44.335 --> 02:45.551
Or a grandfather.

my company,

friends and family.

with one stone.

Not that I'm trying to kill you.

02:57.065 --> 02:59.600
Oh, phew.
Warren, a man of your means

02:59.601 --> 03:01.268
is gonna need some
executive protection.

It's called
"Give the rich guy some space!"

03:09.027 --> 03:11.277

But I want to touch the rich guy!

a lot of rich people
are doing it now...

and I can't be hurt,

Of course.

of those famous burgers.

07:09.183 --> 07:10.966
So it is fraud.
Wait, wh-what?

07:11.051 --> 07:12.268
He's saying you committed fraud.

07:12.269 --> 07:13.936
I-I didn't, that's my friend.

07:13.937 --> 07:15.721
W-what... wait...
‭Thank you for confirming this,

07:15.722 --> 07:16.771
and we'll have
the proper authorities...

07:16.857 --> 07:18.191
Oh, wait, wait.

07:18.192 --> 07:20.026
Bob Belcher. Yes, yes, yes.

07:20.027 --> 07:21.894
I thought you said Boab Belcher.

07:21.895 --> 07:23.112
It just sounded weird
when you said it.

07:23.113 --> 07:24.397
I did write him that check.

07:24.398 --> 07:25.948
You did.
‭WARREN: Mm-hmm.

07:25.949 --> 07:27.116
And it wasn't a terrible mistake

07:27.117 --> 07:28.568
you made by accident?

07:28.569 --> 07:29.702
No. ‭Or a lapse in judgment.

07:29.703 --> 07:31.204
Nope.
‭Serious head injury?

07:31.205 --> 07:32.622
(chuckles) No.
Are you sure?

07:32.623 --> 07:33.705
I'm quite sure.

07:33.740 --> 07:35.208
Okay, then, very well.

07:35.209 --> 07:36.876
Ha!
‭What, Bob?

07:36.877 --> 07:38.294
Ha! Put that down

07:38.295 --> 07:41.297
in the comments section
on my account.

07:41.298 --> 07:44.750
Bob... says... "ha."

07:44.751 --> 07:47.086
Good one, Warren.
You got me.

07:47.087 --> 07:49.388
That guy was so ready
to have you arrested, Bob.

07:49.389 --> 07:50.889
Yep, that's my banker.

07:50.924 --> 07:52.391
That should be their slogan:

07:52.392 --> 07:53.510
"We're ready
to have you arrested!"

07:53.594 --> 07:55.011
What are you guys doing?

07:55.012 --> 07:56.262
Uh, measuring the window
for an awning.

07:56.263 --> 07:57.597
I take it you've met, then.

07:57.598 --> 07:58.848
Yup. I heard all
about it from Linda.

07:58.849 --> 08:00.349
Congrats, Bob.

08:00.350 --> 08:02.017
I always knew you'd
make it big time

08:02.102 --> 08:04.269
if one of your old friends
ever made a bunch of money.

08:04.321 --> 08:05.988
Thanks, Teddy.
I already made a list of repairs

08:05.989 --> 08:07.355
that we can get started on.

08:07.441 --> 08:08.658
It's funny, it came
out to exactly

08:08.659 --> 08:10.358
$100,000 worth of work.

08:10.444 --> 08:11.611
(laughs) It adds up.

08:11.612 --> 08:13.279
It adds up, Bobby.

08:13.280 --> 08:15.031
All right, take it easy, Teddy.
‭Yeah. ‭(bell jingles)

08:15.032 --> 08:17.415
I'm riding this one out
as far as she'll go, Bob!

08:17.451 --> 08:18.784
This is my big break, too!

08:18.785 --> 08:20.336
Quit smudging!

08:20.337 --> 08:22.872
An awning could be
a good idea. ‭Sure.

08:22.873 --> 08:24.673
But I'm surprised you
went for the tiki thing.

08:24.708 --> 08:25.958
(bell jingles) The tiki thing?

08:25.959 --> 08:27.293
Yeah.
You didn't know?

08:27.294 --> 08:28.427
It's gonna be
a palm-frond awning.

08:28.428 --> 08:29.629
We're gonna tiki-fy the place.

08:29.630 --> 08:30.930
"Tiki-fy"?

08:30.931 --> 08:32.298
Oh, you're pranking me.

08:32.299 --> 08:33.549
I-I get it.
Good one.

08:33.549 --> 08:35.134
No, no, I'm serious, Bob.

08:35.135 --> 08:36.519
It's business 101.

08:36.520 --> 08:38.303
You need an entry point, a hook.

08:38.388 --> 08:39.688
I-I figured
we would use the money

08:39.690 --> 08:41.274
to maybe upgrade some equipment,

08:41.275 --> 08:43.308
or do some advertising, but...

08:43.360 --> 08:44.977
This is advertising!

08:44.978 --> 08:46.896
You lure people in with
something flashy and fun,

08:46.897 --> 08:48.731
something
that distinguishes you,

08:48.732 --> 08:50.283
and once they're in,
you wow them with your product.

08:50.284 --> 08:51.484
Makes sense to me.

08:51.535 --> 08:52.651
Thank you, Teddy.

08:52.703 --> 08:54.153
My entry point is my bangs.

08:54.154 --> 08:56.238
Then I wow them with
my winning personality.

08:56.239 --> 08:58.206
You wow me with your breath.
‭Thank you.

08:58.292 --> 09:00.126
Hey! I just realized
it's called an awning

09:00.127 --> 09:01.327
because it's "on" the window.

09:01.328 --> 09:02.627
Oh, yeah!

09:02.663 --> 09:04.297
It's just, tiki, I mean...

09:04.298 --> 09:05.748
should we talk about this?

09:05.749 --> 09:07.583
Hey, if you don't like it,
we can do something else,

09:07.584 --> 09:09.135
but I think
you're gonna like it.

09:09.136 --> 09:10.920
It goes with the whole
beach town thing.

09:11.004 --> 09:12.755
You walk in here, see the tiki,

09:12.756 --> 09:15.007
and you say, "Yeah.
It makes sense. Perfect."

09:15.008 --> 09:16.925
We do live by the beach.

09:17.010 --> 09:18.643
I... I don't know.

09:18.679 --> 09:20.012
Don't-don't worry, Bob.

09:20.013 --> 09:21.430
The destination
is still your burger,

09:21.431 --> 09:23.349
but the restaurant
is the journey there.

09:23.350 --> 09:25.067
Wow, I just got chills.

09:25.068 --> 09:26.686
From me.
‭Okay...

09:26.687 --> 09:28.404
Plus, I found a bunch
of tiki stuff for sale

09:28.405 --> 09:30.189
at a place that went out
of business in Bog Harbor.

09:30.190 --> 09:32.108
But they went out of business

09:32.109 --> 09:34.160
so that doesn't seem like...

09:34.161 --> 09:36.746
They didn't have
your superior product, Bob.

09:36.747 --> 09:38.447
Tell you what,
I'll go check that stuff out

09:38.448 --> 09:40.032
and you keep Tik-ing about it.

09:40.033 --> 09:41.667
See? All these fun jokes
we can make?

09:41.668 --> 09:43.336
Yup, that's... great.
(door opens, bell jingles)

09:43.337 --> 09:45.371
I mean, we'll think of better
ones, but you get the idea.

09:45.372 --> 09:46.588
See you in a bit!

09:46.673 --> 09:49.041
A theme? Lin,
we already have a theme.

09:49.042 --> 09:50.793
It's a restaurant.
Restaurant theme.

09:50.794 --> 09:52.127
It'll probably be

09:52.212 --> 09:53.512
just a couple things

09:53.513 --> 09:54.680
to spruce up the place,
you know?

09:54.681 --> 09:55.880
Nothing crazy.

09:55.932 --> 09:58.134
So, this is a lot

09:58.135 --> 09:59.718
of stuff.

09:59.770 --> 10:01.053
Yeah, great stuff.

10:01.054 --> 10:02.438
We got the tiki water pitchers,

10:02.439 --> 10:03.719
the tiki salt
and pepper shakers.

10:03.724 --> 10:05.691
Tiki straws for tiki spitballs.

10:05.692 --> 10:07.393
(door opens, bell jingles) Ow.

10:07.394 --> 10:08.861
Umbrellas for the drinks.

10:08.862 --> 10:10.730
In case it rains,
keep the ice dry.

10:10.731 --> 10:13.232
Couple of tiki statues...
ooh, scary!

10:13.233 --> 10:14.482
Where do these guys go?

10:14.568 --> 10:16.035
Wherever there's space...

10:16.036 --> 10:18.237
tables, countertops, everywhere!
What's this?

10:18.238 --> 10:19.821
That's to wrap around
the bottom of the counter.

10:19.906 --> 10:21.407
Ooh, our counter's gonna look

10:21.408 --> 10:22.958
like a sexy hula dancer!

10:22.959 --> 10:25.077
Should I start wearing
a coconut bra?

10:25.078 --> 10:27.046
No. ‭Yes.
Everybody's thinking it.

10:27.047 --> 10:29.665
And here's the crown jewel
of it all...

10:29.666 --> 10:30.799
PINEAPPLE: Aloha!

10:30.884 --> 10:32.334
(gasps) You can talk!

10:32.335 --> 10:33.886
(chuckles)
It's on a motion detector.

10:33.887 --> 10:36.055
You put it near the door,
and when people walk by,

10:36.056 --> 10:37.924
it says, "Aloha."
I wanted that job.

10:38.008 --> 10:41.259
Wow, I, uh, usually don't
like sunglasses indoors,

10:41.344 --> 10:42.395
but that pineapple
really pulls it off.

10:42.396 --> 10:43.928
That is one cool fruit.

10:44.014 --> 10:46.098
People are gonna go crazy
for that pineapple.

10:46.099 --> 10:48.434
Yeah. ‭What a time to be alive.

10:48.435 --> 10:50.269
You're gonna love
the giant volcano it sits on.

10:50.270 --> 10:51.737
Will you give me
a hand with it, Teddy?

10:51.738 --> 10:53.105
Sure, sure.
Moving mountains.

10:53.106 --> 10:54.774
This is what God must feel like.

10:54.775 --> 10:57.493
(bell jingles) (hesitantly):
Well, this is very exciting.

10:57.494 --> 10:59.528
And now we don't need
to go to Hawaii.

10:59.529 --> 11:00.989
(laughs) ‭PINEAPPLE: Aloha!

11:01.046 --> 11:02.580
Aloha to you.

11:02.581 --> 11:04.582
Hey, pineapple,
if I'm supposed to marry a cute boy

11:04.583 --> 11:06.668
and live on a horse
farm, say "aloha."

11:06.669 --> 11:08.086
PINEAPPLE: Aloha!
Yes.

11:08.087 --> 11:10.088
And if you're kidding,
say "aloha" again.

11:10.089 --> 11:11.806
PINEAPPLE: Aloha!
Damn.

11:11.807 --> 11:13.674
Kids, enough.
Leave the pineapple alone.

11:13.759 --> 11:15.226
(Teddy and Warren grunting)

11:15.227 --> 11:18.062
God, that is really giant.

11:18.063 --> 11:19.347
WARREN:
Yeah, I got the biggest one.

11:19.348 --> 11:20.764
So what do you think, partner?

11:20.850 --> 11:22.517
Great. Really great.

11:22.518 --> 11:24.018
(grunts)

11:24.019 --> 11:25.904
And this is all just
the tip of the iceberg.

11:25.905 --> 11:27.856
I have two words for you, Bob:

11:27.857 --> 11:29.691
Mai-tai fries.
What?

11:29.692 --> 11:31.526
They're like daiquiri fries
but Mai tai.

11:31.527 --> 11:33.193
It's the next big thing.
We'll talk about it later.

11:33.245 --> 11:34.829
And here you go.

11:34.830 --> 11:36.197
Aloha!
‭Aloha!

11:36.198 --> 11:37.782
Aloha!
‭Aloha!

11:37.783 --> 11:39.750
Eh, I will not
get tired of this.

11:39.835 --> 11:41.786

of any of this stuff.

Back to the Future II.
Men in Back II.

11:51.889 --> 11:53.139
Guess Who's Back?
‭Yes!

11:53.140 --> 11:54.391
Yes to which one?

11:54.392 --> 11:56.226
Well, hers,
'cause it's a real movie,

11:56.227 --> 11:57.609
and it's the one
I was thinking of.

11:57.695 --> 11:58.728
Oh, that's how you play.

11:58.729 --> 12:00.530
Our team wins.
‭And we lose.

12:00.531 --> 12:02.133
Thanks for phoning it in, Dad.

12:02.199 --> 12:04.117
Wow, that was great.

12:04.118 --> 12:06.368
So this is what a real family
does for fun, huh?

12:06.404 --> 12:08.288
That was the first time
we ever played charades.

12:08.289 --> 12:09.873
We thought you wanted to do it.

12:09.874 --> 12:11.809
Yeah, because you said,
"Should we play charades now?"

12:11.876 --> 12:13.626
Either way, good game, everyone,

12:13.627 --> 12:15.578
but I am beat.
I got to hit the sack.

12:15.579 --> 12:17.047
Good night, Bob's wonderful family.
LOUISE: Sweet dreams.

12:17.048 --> 12:18.149
TINA: Sleep tight.
BOB AND LINDA: Good night.

12:18.165 --> 12:19.799
Adios.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.000
So, Bob,
you've been a little quiet tonight.

12:21.001 --> 12:22.000
Is everything okay?

12:22.053 --> 12:23.970
Okay? Everything's great.

He's singing in the bathroom.

a little pee on the seat ♪
