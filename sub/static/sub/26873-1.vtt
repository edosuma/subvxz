01:53.411 --> 01:55.599
- Yeah, and I'll be in
Connecticut from here on out.

01:55.599 --> 01:57.599
Just, all you gotta do
is Dropbox me the footage

01:57.599 --> 01:59.250
and I'll take care of it.

01:59.250 --> 02:01.614
You got the address I sent you, right?

02:01.614 --> 02:02.767
Yeah.

02:02.767 --> 02:05.405
Alright, yeah, it's My uncle's place.

02:05.405 --> 02:07.506
Hey Allen, thank you.

02:07.506 --> 02:08.756
For everything.

02:14.025 --> 02:16.666
- What's up simpleton?

02:16.666 --> 02:17.770
- Where's the truck?

02:17.770 --> 02:19.185
- What do you mean?

02:19.185 --> 02:20.210
- You're the only fireman in the world

02:20.210 --> 02:21.406
with a brand new Buick.

02:21.406 --> 02:23.179
- Yeah, I like to stand out.

02:23.179 --> 02:24.453
- Yeah, you do that.

02:24.453 --> 02:25.628
- Be careful, don't slide it.

02:25.628 --> 02:26.963
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

02:26.963 --> 02:28.626
- How was the train?

02:28.626 --> 02:30.764
- Uh, it's fine, it sucked.

02:30.764 --> 02:31.831
- Yeah?

02:31.831 --> 02:32.914
Jesus Christ!

02:34.126 --> 02:35.084
You're just like Marie.

02:35.084 --> 02:36.342
Marie slams the door too!

02:36.342 --> 02:38.380
- Sorry, sorry.
- The thing's new!

02:38.380 --> 02:39.232
- How is Marie?

02:39.232 --> 02:40.671
- Marie's doing good.

02:40.671 --> 02:42.254
She hasn't changed.

02:43.624 --> 02:45.087
- That train was packed 'til Milford, man.

02:45.087 --> 02:47.920
- Oh, Tommy, your breath is awful!

02:48.758 --> 02:50.075
- I had two beers on the train.

02:50.075 --> 02:53.325
- Yeah, and what else, a shit sandwich?

02:56.092 --> 02:57.404
- How's Sammie?

02:57.404 --> 02:59.787
- Big, eats everything in sight.

02:59.787 --> 03:00.629
- Oh, shit, you don't have one

03:00.629 --> 03:02.210
of those fat kids, do you, Dominic?

03:02.210 --> 03:03.274
- Not at all!

03:03.274 --> 03:05.047
She's got my metabolism.

03:05.047 --> 03:06.979
Why didn't you come to the wedding?

03:06.979 --> 03:08.301
It was hilarious.

03:08.301 --> 03:10.475
Marie got hammered, I was stoned.

03:10.475 --> 03:12.362
- I'd be hammered and stoned
too if I had to watch that.

03:12.362 --> 03:15.662
- Hey, my dad is stubborn,
so don't say a word about it.

03:15.662 --> 03:16.536
- I won't.

03:16.536 --> 03:18.672
- Leave him alone.

03:18.672 --> 03:19.860
Dude, you gotta be in New York.

03:19.860 --> 03:21.562
What the hell are you
gonna do around here?

03:21.562 --> 03:23.079
- I couldn't afford New York anymore, man.

03:23.079 --> 03:25.512
- Get a smaller place, a roommate, even.

03:25.512 --> 03:27.577
Or go down to Florida
with your mom and dad.

03:27.577 --> 03:28.648
You're a moron.

03:28.648 --> 03:30.352
- I'm all set here.

03:30.352 --> 03:33.904
- Well, now you're gonna be
stuck with my dad and Varya.

03:33.904 --> 03:34.737
- Is that how you say it?

03:34.737 --> 03:36.521
I thought it was Var-ee-ya, Var-ee-ya?

03:36.521 --> 03:37.479
- Varya.
- Varya.

03:37.479 --> 03:38.312
- Varya!

03:38.312 --> 03:39.505
- Yeah, yeah, okay, whatever.

03:39.505 --> 03:40.338
- Varya.

03:40.338 --> 03:42.346
- However you say it, it
sounds like venereal disease.

03:42.346 --> 03:44.178
- That's terrible.

03:44.178 --> 03:45.362
- You laugh 'cause it's true.

03:45.362 --> 03:46.764
- Yeah, well.

03:46.764 --> 03:48.972
I gotta stop home and
get my charger, okay?

03:48.972 --> 03:49.915
- Yeah, no, that's fine.

03:49.915 --> 03:51.688
I kinda wanna change anyway.

04:02.343 --> 04:03.229
- Yo!

04:03.229 --> 04:04.646
- Is that Cheech?

04:06.505 --> 04:07.338
- Give me that.

04:07.338 --> 04:08.442
- Thanks.

04:08.442 --> 04:09.992
- What are you doin', sizzle-chest?

04:09.992 --> 04:12.050
- Hey, Uncle Dom.

04:12.050 --> 04:14.404
- Don't get too
close, his breath is awful!

04:14.404 --> 04:15.737
- What are you talkin' about?

04:15.737 --> 04:17.488
Smells like peppermint.

04:17.488 --> 04:18.661
Hey, you look good, Cheech.

04:18.661 --> 04:19.495
- Thank you.

04:19.495 --> 04:21.927
- He's an idiot
for not staying in the city!

04:21.927 --> 04:22.760
- Don't worry about it.

04:22.760 --> 04:25.334
We got a room in the basement
for ya all set up, okay?

04:25.334 --> 04:27.140
You know, Auntie Lori Would have had

04:27.140 --> 04:29.798
a big plate of food waiting for ya.

04:29.798 --> 04:31.052
- Yeah, I know.

04:31.052 --> 04:31.973
Thank you.

04:31.973 --> 04:33.321
- You hungry?

04:33.321 --> 04:35.185
- No, I'm good, I'm just tired.

04:35.185 --> 04:36.653
- You're going to
Matillo's tomorrow, right?

04:36.653 --> 04:38.272
Bobby gonna hook you up with a car?

04:38.272 --> 04:40.024
- Yeah, actually, I'm
gonna need a ride, though.

04:40.024 --> 04:40.857
I don't know if you're free--

04:40.857 --> 04:41.815
- I'll take you!

04:41.815 --> 04:42.857
- Jesus Christ!

04:42.982 --> 04:44.733
Ow, hi, yeah, great.

04:44.733 --> 04:45.566
- How are you?

04:45.566 --> 04:47.092
- I'm great, Marie, now get off my back!

04:47.092 --> 04:47.982
Okay, hi.

04:47.982 --> 04:49.248
- Oh my God, you'd look the same

04:49.248 --> 04:50.479
without the string mustache!

04:50.479 --> 04:51.768
- Yeah, thanks, you look great too.

04:51.768 --> 04:55.495
- Oh my God,
you're my roommate now.

04:55.495 --> 04:56.328
Gonna fuck shit up.

04:56.328 --> 04:57.661
- If you say so.

04:58.661 --> 05:01.314
- Holly and I might go to
New Haven on Friday, come.

05:01.314 --> 05:02.777
- Yeah, okay, if I can make it.

05:02.777 --> 05:04.293
- Oh, shut up, you're not doing anything.

05:04.293 --> 05:05.317
Plus Holly wants to fuck you.

05:05.317 --> 05:06.739
- Marie!

05:06.739 --> 05:08.088
- Sorry!

05:08.088 --> 05:09.551
- Well, plus, I already told
her you were coming, so.

05:09.551 --> 05:10.384
- Oh, great.

05:10.384 --> 05:11.217
- You gotta come to my place and see Sammy

05:12.205 --> 05:13.803
I'm picking her up from
her mother's later.

05:13.803 --> 05:14.636
- Sure, yeah.

05:14.636 --> 05:15.929
- Now wait a second, time out, Tommy.

05:15.929 --> 05:17.467
You gotta help me with
this computer stuff.

05:17.467 --> 05:18.678
I can't figure this out.

05:18.678 --> 05:19.511
- Yeah, whenever--

05:19.511 --> 05:21.644
- Oh, hello!

05:21.644 --> 05:24.250
- Oh.
- Oh!

05:25.083 --> 05:25.916
- Say hi to my wife.

05:25.916 --> 05:26.896
She's my wife now, Tommy!

05:26.896 --> 05:28.034
- Yes, yes!
- Yeah, I know, I know!

05:28.034 --> 05:29.230
Congratulations!

05:29.230 --> 05:32.160
Hi, Varya, um, ah, how are you?

05:32.160 --> 05:33.577
- Ah, good, good.

05:34.612 --> 05:36.132
Long day, tired.

05:36.132 --> 05:36.965
- Yeah, yeah.

05:36.965 --> 05:37.798
- You go shower, Sweetheart.

05:37.798 --> 05:40.363
I'll make your tea for you, okay?

05:40.363 --> 05:43.399
- I, I be right back.

05:43.399 --> 05:44.564
Good to see you.

05:44.564 --> 05:46.147
- You, too.

05:46.990 --> 05:48.613
- I've never been happier.

05:48.613 --> 05:50.900
Well, since your Auntie Lori.

05:50.900 --> 05:52.740
- Yeah, no, I know what you meant.

05:52.740 --> 05:53.777
- You know, she always
loved when you would

05:53.777 --> 05:58.464
spend weekends here and at
the beach house in Madison.

05:58.464 --> 06:01.084
By the way, the Gavin's
know you moved back yet?

06:01.084 --> 06:02.694
- Uh, no.

06:02.694 --> 06:04.270
My computer and camera stuff,

06:04.270 --> 06:05.546
it should all be here tomorrow.

06:05.546 --> 06:06.996
- You just reminded me.

06:06.996 --> 06:09.376
Jerry and Allison are having
Vinny baptized next Sunday,

06:09.376 --> 06:11.036
and they want you to do the video.

06:11.036 --> 06:11.869
- Yeah.

06:11.869 --> 06:13.217
- They'll pay you!

06:13.217 --> 06:14.294
- Cool, yeah, sweet.

06:14.294 --> 06:16.175
I'll give 'em a call.

06:16.175 --> 06:17.008
- Alright, now look.

06:17.008 --> 06:19.734
Sit down, I'll get you some
vino and you can relax, okay?

06:19.734 --> 06:21.151
- Yeah, I'll try.

06:22.862 --> 06:26.181
- Hey, you're always welcome here.

06:26.181 --> 06:27.848
- Thanks, Uncle Dom.

06:35.609 --> 06:37.609
- Welcome back, asshole.

06:41.796 --> 06:42.629
- Hello!

06:43.799 --> 06:48.121
Welcome to Soviet Russia,
where we drink Svedka,

06:48.121 --> 06:49.337
but not Grey Goose!

06:49.337 --> 06:50.170
- Ha ha ha.

06:50.237 --> 06:51.613
- Grey Goose make you gay!

06:51.904 --> 06:52.737
- Your terrible.

06:52.737 --> 06:55.517
- Gay French men, according to Putin.

06:55.518 --> 06:58.059
All hail, shirtless Putin.

06:58.059 --> 07:01.851
We're going to sing,
dance, do as Russians do!

07:01.851 --> 07:05.168
Fuck bear, suck cabbage!

07:06.201 --> 07:07.823
- You're terrible, but
that's actually pretty funny.

07:09.809 --> 07:12.435
- Thank God you're here.

07:12.435 --> 07:14.171
I'm losing my mind.

07:14.171 --> 07:16.676
- It can't be that bad!

07:16.676 --> 07:21.391
- Dude, my dad got the
Rosetta Stone Russian thing.

07:21.391 --> 07:23.279
You'll hear him every morning
in his office doing it.

07:23.279 --> 07:24.439
He sounds like an asshole.

07:24.439 --> 07:25.272
- Christ.

07:25.272 --> 07:27.132
- If Russians weren't
white he'd sound racist.

07:27.965 --> 07:29.662
So what are you gonna do,
you gonna look for a job?

07:30.537 --> 07:32.307
What do you even do?

07:32.307 --> 07:33.549
- You know, videography.

07:33.549 --> 07:37.538
Like camera, shoot for weddings,
or get a commercial gig,

07:37.538 --> 07:39.534
or a school play, bar mitzvah.

07:39.534 --> 07:41.920
- No bar
mitzvahs in North Branford.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.325
- Yeah, well, you know what I mean.

07:44.350 --> 07:47.495
Until then, I'm gonna need a car.

07:47.569 --> 07:49.840
- If I was off tomorrow, I'd go with you.

07:49.874 --> 07:51.313
- Why don't you just take
the day off, come with me.

07:51.313 --> 07:52.911
- I can't!

07:52.911 --> 07:55.060
I'd have to be on call, and
I'm not that kind of nurse.

07:55.060 --> 07:57.027
But I'm serious about Friday.

07:57.027 --> 08:01.255
Going to New Haven, or
Eli's, I haven't decided yet.

08:01.255 --> 08:04.490
Also, I told Holly you were coming back.

08:04.490 --> 08:06.339
She's excited!

08:06.339 --> 08:08.170
She wants to fuck you, dude!

08:08.170 --> 08:10.440
- Well, that is not gonna happen.

08:10.440 --> 08:11.731
- Why, why not, what's wrong with her?

08:11.731 --> 08:13.554
- Dom fucked her.

08:13.554 --> 08:14.612
- So?

08:14.612 --> 08:15.753
So did Danny.

08:15.753 --> 08:16.821
Those guys are super horny.

08:16.821 --> 08:19.537
They'd try to fuck a bride
on her way down the aisle.

08:19.537 --> 08:20.870
- How is Danny?

08:20.870 --> 08:22.620
- Oh, he's a cop now.

08:23.505 --> 08:24.940
Yeah, I know.

08:24.940 --> 08:26.010
If one more girl asks to see his gun

08:26.010 --> 08:27.690
I'm gonna shoot his dick off with it.

08:29.047 --> 08:30.464
Hey, wanna smoke?

08:32.876 --> 08:35.431
- Come on, smoke with me.

08:35.431 --> 08:37.212
You never do.

08:37.212 --> 08:39.280
- If I never
do, then why do you ask?

08:39.280 --> 08:42.964
- Because I am always, always hoping.

08:42.964 --> 08:43.797
- Hoping?

08:43.797 --> 08:45.263
- Yeah!

08:45.263 --> 08:46.096
- For what?

08:46.096 --> 08:49.429
- For you to take a single puff with me.

08:52.046 --> 08:53.084
- Next time?

08:53.084 --> 08:53.917
- Next time, really?

08:53.917 --> 08:55.134
- Yeah, next time.

08:55.134 --> 08:56.570
- I don't believe you.

08:56.570 --> 08:57.638
- I don't believe me either.

08:57.638 --> 09:00.524
- Full of shit.

09:00.524 --> 09:05.057
- Alright, you know, why
don't you get me a beer.

09:05.057 --> 09:07.105
Yeah, you smoke, I drink, we'll have fun.

09:07.105 --> 09:07.938
It'll be fine.

09:07.938 --> 09:11.021
- Okay, let's make a compromise here.

09:13.096 --> 09:15.659
So, I will get us both beers.

09:15.659 --> 09:16.777
- Alright.

09:16.777 --> 09:17.799
- Good?

09:17.799 --> 09:21.008
And then, I'm gonna go over there

09:21.008 --> 09:25.925
and get that joint and you will
take a single, single puff.

09:28.380 --> 09:29.213
Right?

09:30.662 --> 09:31.712
- Next time.

09:31.712 --> 09:33.129
I pinkie promise.

09:34.680 --> 09:35.597
- You suck.

09:36.612 --> 09:38.936
- I can live with that.

09:38.936 --> 09:40.898
- I'm still gonna smoke.

09:40.898 --> 09:41.981
- You do you.

09:45.479 --> 09:46.399
- Oh God.

09:46.399 --> 09:47.649
- What's wrong?

09:48.537 --> 09:50.596
- There are like four
kids in skinny jeans.

09:50.596 --> 09:51.484
- What?

09:51.484 --> 09:52.598
- They're gonna steal my stuff.

10:00.984 --> 10:03.064
What are you lookin' at?

10:03.064 --> 10:05.147
- Your adorable red eyes.

10:06.854 --> 10:08.346
- They're not red.

10:08.346 --> 10:09.474
- You're right, I was just kidding.

10:09.474 --> 10:10.307
- Mmhmm.

10:11.923 --> 10:13.173

10:14.581 --> 10:16.788
Wanna play a game?

10:16.788 --> 10:18.407

10:18.407 --> 10:19.240
Let's see.

10:20.832 --> 10:22.999
Kiss me like our first date.

10:28.706 --> 10:31.956
Kiss me like you'll never see me again.

10:35.243 --> 10:36.076
- No.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.454
That's sad.

10:38.454 --> 10:39.287

10:39.287 --> 10:42.204
Well, then kiss me merry Christmas.

10:46.219 --> 10:47.052

11:02.673 --> 11:05.006
I was gonna make you a tree.

11:06.765 --> 11:08.767
- No, thanks, I'm good.

11:08.767 --> 11:09.928
- Come on, don't be a pussy!

11:09.928 --> 11:11.483

You know, seriously, though.

11:23.405 --> 11:26.405
I'm really excited that you're back.

11:28.018 --> 11:29.601
My dad's losing it.

11:31.124 --> 11:32.169
- How's Varya?

11:32.169 --> 11:33.746
You know, is she?

11:33.746 --> 11:35.518
- I don't care.

11:35.518 --> 11:39.851
He's happy, it's easier to
let him do what he wants.

11:45.890 --> 11:48.585
Fuck, now I gotta get high!

13:04.831 --> 13:06.554
You would buy her that.

13:06.554 --> 13:07.887
- She wanted it.

13:08.787 --> 13:10.232
Are you gonna bang Holly?

13:10.232 --> 13:12.605
- Why does everyone want me to bang Holly?

13:12.605 --> 13:13.952
- Do it, get laid!

13:13.952 --> 13:14.952

13:43.638 --> 13:44.471
- No!

13:46.258 --> 13:47.091
- Let me get this straight.

13:47.091 --> 13:48.373
You're gonna have some chick over

13:48.373 --> 13:50.604
while your daughter's
sleepin' in the next room?

13:50.604 --> 13:52.021
That's sick, Dom.

13:53.589 --> 13:55.692
- If I gotta girl over,
she sleeps downstairs.

13:55.692 --> 13:59.052
She's got all her toys, the couch, a TV.

13:59.052 --> 14:02.264
- Yeah, real nice Casey Anthony.

14:02.264 --> 14:04.976
- I check on her and it's
not like I'm hiding her.

14:04.976 --> 14:07.059
They all know she's here.

14:08.160 --> 14:09.413
- They all?

14:09.413 --> 14:12.299
How many girls do you have
comin' out of this place?

14:12.299 --> 14:13.910
- I don't know, just some chicks.

14:13.910 --> 14:16.005
Which is exactly what you should
be doin' in New York City.

14:16.005 --> 14:17.271
Dude, you're a fucking moron.

14:17.271 --> 14:18.843
- Yeah, yeah, you wanna
go to New York City?

14:18.843 --> 14:19.893
Be my fucking guest.

14:19.893 --> 14:21.479
It was a big fucking
expense I couldn't afford.

14:21.479 --> 14:24.612
I couldn't find enough
work, but you have fun.

14:24.612 --> 14:26.125

Oh, God, Sammy!

14:33.025 --> 14:33.952

14:33.952 --> 14:35.180

14:44.992 --> 14:45.825
- Marie, please.

14:45.825 --> 14:47.049

14:47.049 --> 14:48.810

14:48.810 --> 14:50.420

14:50.420 --> 14:51.570
- Ma, I didn't do anything?

14:51.570 --> 14:52.971

tits were hanging out.

14:57.387 --> 14:58.525
You leave her alone.

14:58.525 --> 15:00.159
What were you doing
there in the first place?

15:00.159 --> 15:02.255
- She told me to come over,
hang out with her and Marie.

15:02.255 --> 15:04.036
- She didn't even tell me she texted you.

15:04.036 --> 15:05.195
- She's in high school, Dominic.

15:05.195 --> 15:06.028
- She's 18!

15:06.028 --> 15:07.642
- Yeah, she just turned 18!

16:28.138 --> 16:29.426
I don't wanna look at you right now.

16:57.876 --> 17:00.412
Bobby's doing me a solid with this.

17:00.412 --> 17:01.517

17:01.517 --> 17:02.767

clean up these headlights.

17:08.746 --> 17:10.934
But the rest is up to God.

17:10.934 --> 17:14.049
- She's got clean tires,
that's all I care about.

17:14.049 --> 17:15.509
- I wouldn't put my name on it.

17:15.509 --> 17:18.729
- It's not gonna be your name, it's mine.

17:18.729 --> 17:23.218

go inside and tell him.

17:23.218 --> 17:25.397

How long are you here for?

18:24.456 --> 18:25.698

18:30.783 --> 18:31.924

18:31.924 --> 18:33.350
What are you talkin' about.

18:33.350 --> 18:37.412
Now you got the clam and the

Hey, you guys have flex and park?

- Tomorrow?

18:46.544 --> 18:48.252
They're supposed to come today.

18:48.252 --> 18:49.085
- I don't know.

18:49.085 --> 18:50.533
My dad texted me and told me to tell you.

18:50.533 --> 18:51.572
- Why doesn't your dad text me?

18:51.572 --> 18:52.405
Why doesn't he call me?

18:52.405 --> 18:55.838
I have a phone, I can do the texting.

18:55.838 --> 18:58.391

19:08.881 --> 19:10.630
- Hey, whatever you need, alright?

19:10.630 --> 19:11.463
- Thanks, John.

19:11.463 --> 19:12.341
- Whatever you need.

19:12.341 --> 19:13.174
Have a good day.

19:13.174 --> 19:14.188
- Take it easy.

19:14.188 --> 19:15.798
- And you guys should
play music again, come on!

19:15.798 --> 19:17.814
Go to Doody's, get some gigs!

19:17.814 --> 19:20.089
I've been telling you to get back into it!

19:20.089 --> 19:23.339
Ah, Jesus, I got flour all over myself.

19:27.734 --> 19:29.984
- Hey, this isn't your car.

19:31.150 --> 19:33.174
- Yeah, I haven't had
the old on in forever.

19:33.174 --> 19:35.649
Just picked this one up yesterday.

19:35.649 --> 19:36.900
- Huh.

19:36.900 --> 19:37.733
I like it.

19:39.693 --> 19:42.026
So you still playing guitar?

19:42.960 --> 19:44.976
- No, not really at all.

19:44.976 --> 19:46.507
How 'bout you, you still piano?

19:46.507 --> 19:47.756
- Yeah.

19:47.756 --> 19:49.173
Any chance I get.

19:50.227 --> 19:52.855
Hey, we should jam again.

19:52.855 --> 19:54.786
- Yeah, yeah, that could be fun.

19:54.786 --> 19:55.619
- Yeah.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.283
So, you happy to be back?

20:00.545 --> 20:02.295
Never heard from you.

20:03.904 --> 20:04.974
- Yeah, it's okay.

20:04.974 --> 20:07.583
I just, sorry, I didn't
think that you would--

20:07.583 --> 20:09.733
- No, it's all good.

20:09.733 --> 20:11.552
Hey, how's Marie doing?

20:11.552 --> 20:14.425
I mean, you know, considering.

20:14.425 --> 20:15.258
- Right.

20:15.258 --> 20:18.189
Well, you know, it's different, yeah?

20:18.189 --> 20:22.019
But everyone's different
shades of good, I guess.

20:22.019 --> 20:22.852
- Mhmm.

20:24.131 --> 20:27.225
Well, let me know if you
wanna do something soon.

20:27.225 --> 20:28.821
- Absolutely.

20:28.821 --> 20:32.848
- It's good
to see you, Tomooch.

20:32.848 --> 20:33.681
- You too.

20:35.484 --> 20:37.508
Hey, you tell John I
said thanks again, okay.

20:37.508 --> 20:39.050
- Will do.

20:39.050 --> 20:39.883
Be good.

20:42.948 --> 20:44.730

- No, you're good.

21:24.681 --> 21:26.098
I am not worried.

21:29.538 --> 21:30.520
- Do we need to run it again?

21:38.933 --> 21:39.942
- Yeah?

21:39.942 --> 21:40.966
- Yeah.

21:40.966 --> 21:42.549
You guys are ready.

21:43.673 --> 21:44.673
- Thank you.

21:47.282 --> 21:48.782
I've gotta go pee.

21:51.193 --> 21:52.677
- I'm packing this up for tomorrow.

21:52.677 --> 21:54.177
- Alright.

21:58.446 --> 22:03.354
- Hey, Ang,
this is gonna sound crazy,

22:03.354 --> 22:05.854
but that whole handhold thing.

22:08.163 --> 22:08.996
- Hmm?

22:09.999 --> 22:12.977
- Well, you guys kinda held hands.

22:12.977 --> 22:15.298
- Oh, we high-fived.

22:15.298 --> 22:16.131
- Yeah.

22:17.138 --> 22:19.456
It's kinda held at the end.

22:19.456 --> 22:20.373
- Oh, okay.

22:21.834 --> 22:23.522
I'm sorry, I totally didn't mean it.

22:23.522 --> 22:25.272
- It's just, I meant,

22:26.160 --> 22:26.993
you know.

22:26.993 --> 22:29.819
- Okay, yeah, I'm sorry.

22:29.819 --> 22:31.072
- Don't be.

22:31.072 --> 22:31.905
It's fine.

22:32.855 --> 22:34.188
I'm just saying.

22:39.124 --> 22:40.272
- Hey, we still getting sushi?

22:40.272 --> 22:42.678
- Did you wash your hands?

22:42.678 --> 22:44.116
- Yes.

22:44.116 --> 22:45.866
- I don't smell soap.

22:46.865 --> 22:48.245
- I washed them.

22:48.245 --> 22:49.380
- Like his fucking mother.

22:56.648 --> 22:58.479
- Hey.

22:58.479 --> 22:59.940
- Hey!

22:59.940 --> 23:01.863
Tommy, it's so good to see you.

23:01.863 --> 23:03.950
- You too, Holly.

23:03.950 --> 23:05.940
- Are you coming out with us?

23:05.940 --> 23:06.773
- Yeah, no.

23:06.773 --> 23:09.182
I'm not feeling that good tonight.

23:09.182 --> 23:10.932
- Oh, no, that sucks.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.275
- Yeah.
- Ready?

23:13.275 --> 23:15.786
- Yeah, can we smoke before?

23:15.786 --> 23:16.989
- I'm out.

23:16.989 --> 23:20.347
- Oh, man, you dirty little whore.

23:20.347 --> 23:23.545
- What can I say.

23:23.545 --> 23:25.386
- That's alright,
let's hit the road.

23:25.386 --> 23:27.053
- Come on, let's go.

23:28.608 --> 23:29.838
Bye, lame-ass!

23:29.838 --> 23:31.216
- Yeah, next time, I swear.

23:31.216 --> 23:32.083
- Uh-huh.

23:32.083 --> 23:33.166
- You better.

23:36.980 --> 23:40.127
You told me he was coming out.

23:40.127 --> 23:41.771
- He just doesn't feel like it.

23:41.771 --> 23:43.416
- Why not?

23:43.416 --> 23:47.261
- Because he doesn't want to.

23:47.261 --> 23:48.989
- Well, I don't see why he can't come out

23:48.989 --> 23:50.987
and have a good time with his old friends.

23:50.987 --> 23:52.874
I don't understand why
he has to shut us out.

23:52.874 --> 23:54.012
- Come on, don't be a bitch.

23:54.012 --> 23:55.726
Let's just go, come on.

23:55.726 --> 23:57.226
- I'm just sayin'.

24:10.755 --> 24:14.331
Tommy, can you help me with Marie?

24:14.331 --> 24:15.998
She's really wasted.

24:17.590 --> 24:19.897
- Yeah, I'll be right there.

24:19.897 --> 24:20.730
- Thanks.

24:23.188 --> 24:24.612
Almost there.

24:24.612 --> 24:25.445
- Ow.

24:25.445 --> 24:26.278
- You got this, Marie.

24:26.278 --> 24:27.272
- Go, go, go.

24:27.272 --> 24:28.522
- Okay.

24:30.197 --> 24:31.510
Thanks for the help, Tommy.

24:31.510 --> 24:32.973
- Let me take the shoes from you.

24:32.973 --> 24:33.806
There we go.

24:33.806 --> 24:35.803
- There you go, girl.

24:35.803 --> 24:38.237
- That's not, okay.

24:38.237 --> 24:40.480
- She's in the bed.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.495
- Did she drive?

24:42.495 --> 24:43.328
- She did.

24:43.328 --> 24:44.612
She's as sober as a fucking bird.

24:44.612 --> 24:45.478
No, of course I did!

24:45.478 --> 24:46.311
- Okay.

24:46.311 --> 24:47.484
- Can you go get a pail?

24:47.484 --> 24:48.317
- Yeah.

24:51.051 --> 24:52.222
- It's alright.

24:52.222 --> 24:54.452
I got ya home in your bed.

24:54.452 --> 24:55.626
- I so love you.

24:55.626 --> 24:57.832
- Oh, I love you too.

24:57.832 --> 24:59.386
It was a fun night.

24:59.386 --> 25:00.381
Fun times.

25:00.381 --> 25:03.048
We didn't even smoke beforehand.

25:05.682 --> 25:07.234
Thanks, Tommy.

25:07.234 --> 25:09.546
- Hey Marie, why don't
you roll this way, okay?

25:09.546 --> 25:11.996
I got the pail over here, yup.

25:11.996 --> 25:14.007
I'm gonna hang out for a little bit

25:14.007 --> 25:17.090
just in case you've gotta puke, okay?

25:18.396 --> 25:19.770
- Me too.
- Oh, you're the best.

25:19.770 --> 25:20.746
- No, you can go home.

25:20.746 --> 25:21.620
You're fine.

25:21.620 --> 25:23.703
- No, it's fine, I worry.

25:29.737 --> 25:31.536
- Well, that's the calamari.

25:31.536 --> 25:33.572
- Shut up.

25:33.572 --> 25:34.605
Stop.

25:34.605 --> 25:35.438
- Sorry.

25:36.931 --> 25:39.231
I keep telling you to
take it easy, though.

25:39.231 --> 25:42.731
- Yeah, I heard you the first time.

25:47.417 --> 25:50.049
- You know, just clean up well,

25:50.049 --> 25:54.236
let me know when you're
okay, and I'll take you home.

25:54.236 --> 25:56.885
- It's okay, I can stay a little longer.

25:56.885 --> 25:58.252
- You're gonna regret it, babe.

25:58.252 --> 26:01.085
Seriously, I wanna drive you home.

26:08.693 --> 26:10.593
- You're saying you don't want me here?

26:10.593 --> 26:12.018
- No.

26:12.018 --> 26:14.384
- Okay, then shut up.

26:14.384 --> 26:16.032
- I just, you're a little drunk,

26:16.032 --> 26:20.365
I thought you could use the
rest before your flight.

26:23.644 --> 26:24.728
You can spend the night if you want,

26:24.728 --> 26:25.686
but we're just gonna have to get up

26:25.686 --> 26:28.278
even earlier in the morning.

26:28.278 --> 26:29.817
- Is the door locked?

26:29.817 --> 26:30.734
- Uh, yeah.

26:37.695 --> 26:41.195
Yeah, well, okay, you can spend the night.

26:42.213 --> 26:44.353
- I don't wanna go tomorrow.

26:44.353 --> 26:45.504
- It's only four days.

26:45.504 --> 26:47.318
It's a wedding, free booze.

26:47.318 --> 26:49.677
- Still, I'm gonna miss you.

26:49.677 --> 26:50.510
- I know.

26:53.758 --> 26:54.965
- What?

26:54.965 --> 26:56.117
- Calamari.

26:56.117 --> 26:56.950
- Fuck you!

26:56.950 --> 26:57.785
- Well, no, I'm sorry.

26:57.785 --> 26:59.257
It's fine, just get more mouthwash.

26:59.257 --> 27:01.304
- No, I wanna go home.

27:01.304 --> 27:03.336
- Really?

27:03.336 --> 27:05.694
- You are such a fucking asshole!

27:05.694 --> 27:08.209
Do you know how fucking
embarrassing this is for me?

27:08.209 --> 27:09.368
I was gonna let you fuck me,

27:09.368 --> 27:11.386
and then you're like, uh, calamari!

27:11.386 --> 27:12.723
- Stop, Kara, stop.

27:12.723 --> 27:14.882
- No, fuck you, I wanna go home.

27:14.882 --> 27:16.343
- What, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

27:16.343 --> 27:17.176
I'm sorry.

27:17.176 --> 27:18.807
- What, am I too drunk for you?

27:18.807 --> 27:19.991
- No, you're not drunk.

27:19.991 --> 27:21.210
- You thought I was.

27:21.210 --> 27:22.658
- Yeah, well, I didn't know like sloppy.

27:22.658 --> 27:23.815
I just felt like you're
gonna be hung over tomorrow,

27:23.815 --> 27:25.580
it's gonna suck to fly, I don't even know.

27:25.580 --> 27:26.413
It's not a problem.

27:26.413 --> 27:27.734
- No, no, take me home.

27:27.734 --> 27:29.675
You ruined it.

27:29.675 --> 27:30.699
- Seriously?

27:30.699 --> 27:31.532
- Yeah.

27:32.782 --> 27:35.645
- Kara, I don't care if
we, you know, whatever.

27:35.645 --> 27:38.350
I just, you're about to go, I don't want--

27:38.350 --> 27:39.350
- Just stop!

27:40.929 --> 27:41.762
Let's go.

27:44.521 --> 27:45.879
Or I can fucking walk!

27:45.879 --> 27:48.559
- Okay, you're not gonna,
you're not gonna walk.

27:48.559 --> 27:50.392
You're not gonna walk.

27:55.453 --> 27:57.870
Hey, she's pretty passed out.

27:59.013 --> 28:00.385
- Okay.

28:00.385 --> 28:01.912
- Um, are you too tired?

28:01.912 --> 28:03.476
Do you need me to give you a ride home?

28:03.476 --> 28:04.717
- No, I'm okay.

28:04.717 --> 28:08.615
I was thinking of staying
here on the couch.

28:08.615 --> 28:10.560
- Why don't you just jump in with her?

28:10.560 --> 28:11.819
- She kicks.

28:11.819 --> 28:14.383
- She does.

28:14.383 --> 28:16.365
- Alright, yeah, take care of yourself.

28:16.365 --> 28:17.483
I'll see you in the morning.

28:17.483 --> 28:18.809
- Okay.

28:18.809 --> 28:20.185
Goodnight, Tommy.

28:33.847 --> 28:34.801
- Hey.

28:34.801 --> 28:36.549
- Hey, this is gonna sound weird,

28:36.549 --> 28:39.399
but do you have a T-shirt
and pair of shorts?

28:39.399 --> 28:41.026
I can't sleep in this skirt.

28:41.026 --> 28:41.943
- Oh, yeah.

28:45.410 --> 28:46.243
Shirt.

28:49.926 --> 28:51.497
And shorts.

28:51.497 --> 28:52.330
- Thanks.

28:52.330 --> 28:53.413
- You got it.

28:57.492 --> 28:59.545
- It's okay, you can look.

28:59.545 --> 29:00.974
- I'm fine.

29:00.974 --> 29:03.698
- Well, that makes me feel great.

29:03.698 --> 29:05.020
- That's not how I meant it.

29:05.020 --> 29:06.937
- I'm fucking with you.

29:12.131 --> 29:14.631
Okay, you can turn around now.

29:19.873 --> 29:21.323
- That's adorable.

29:21.323 --> 29:22.679
- Thanks.

Coffee?

Thank you so much.

30:14.411 --> 30:15.753

- Oh!

30:15.753 --> 30:17.751
Oh, bye!

30:17.751 --> 30:18.604
- Is that Holly?

30:18.604 --> 30:19.950
You sleep okay?

30:19.950 --> 30:22.237
- Yep, hope I didn't wear out my welcome.

30:22.237 --> 30:23.149
- Don't be ridiculous.

30:23.149 --> 30:25.942
We have plenty of stuff,
go eat somethin', okay?

30:25.942 --> 30:28.275

30:50.512 --> 30:51.885

30:51.885 --> 30:53.165
- How good is it?

30:53.165 --> 30:54.373
- The fucking best!

30:54.373 --> 30:55.350
- I know, right?

30:55.350 --> 30:57.688
It's one silver lining.

30:57.688 --> 30:58.521
- Yeah.

31:00.079 --> 31:03.444
Hey, I hope I didn't freak
you out too much last night.

31:03.444 --> 31:06.756
I just got caught up in the moment.

31:06.756 --> 31:08.038
I was a little tipsy.

31:08.038 --> 31:08.871
- Nah, it's okay.

31:08.871 --> 31:10.545
I just, I didn't wanna.

31:10.545 --> 31:11.695
- I understand.

31:11.695 --> 31:12.820
- I mean, I would.

31:12.820 --> 31:13.996
- You don't have to do anything.

31:13.996 --> 31:15.124
- I just, I can't.

31:15.124 --> 31:16.550
- I understand, it's okay.

31:16.550 --> 31:18.122
- I hope that I didn't do anything--

31:18.122 --> 31:19.561
- Oh, God, no.

31:19.561 --> 31:20.894
- Alright, good.

31:31.395 --> 31:33.012

Bobbie Bernstein, Channel 2 News.

32:41.866 --> 32:43.488
- You can't swing at the low ones.

32:43.488 --> 32:44.327
This isn't golf.

32:44.327 --> 32:46.133
Okay, just watch the ball

32:46.133 --> 32:48.354
the whole way down the line, got it?

32:48.354 --> 32:51.436
- You're throwing soft
ball style, it's not fair!

32:51.436 --> 32:53.603
- It doesn't matter, dude.

33:02.166 --> 33:05.148
I gotta go see Little John
at the restaurant real quick.

33:05.148 --> 33:07.817
Do you want me to drop you
home, do you wanna come with?

33:07.817 --> 33:11.077
- Can you drop me home and
get me a slice of pizza?

33:11.077 --> 33:13.318
- No, I'm heating the stuffed shells.

33:13.318 --> 33:15.369
- I don't like stuffed shells.

33:15.369 --> 33:18.874
- How do you not like stuffed shells?

33:23.642 --> 33:24.475
Hey.

33:24.475 --> 33:26.809
- Hey, Tommy was lookin' for ya.

33:26.809 --> 33:27.642

33:27.642 --> 33:29.264

wanted to say hi or somethin'.

33:29.264 --> 33:30.139
He was coming in from ridin'.

I told him to come back

33:34.409 --> 33:35.242
- No, he seemed fine.

33:35.242 --> 33:36.075
Here, take this to your dad.

33:36.075 --> 33:36.908
I don't know what they are.

33:36.908 --> 33:38.808
- Yeah, but he didn't
like say what he wanted?

33:38.808 --> 33:41.111
- I have no idea, alright?

33:41.111 --> 33:42.342
We have no more room,
take 'em to your father.

33:42.342 --> 33:43.425
He can put 'em in his freezer.

33:43.425 --> 33:44.311
- Where is he gonna put this.

33:44.311 --> 33:45.144
- I don't know!

33:45.144 --> 33:46.159
- No, no, no, no, no.

33:46.159 --> 33:48.070
These are not going in my car.

33:48.070 --> 33:48.903

33:49.873 --> 33:51.040
- Because, no!

33:52.232 --> 33:53.065
- Okay.
- Just no!

33:53.065 --> 33:53.958
- Well, we have no more room here.

33:53.958 --> 33:54.844
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

33:54.844 --> 33:55.677
You gotta take 'em to your dad.

33:55.677 --> 33:56.620
- Tell him to pick it up then!

33:56.620 --> 33:58.413
- Like he's gonna pick it up here?

33:58.413 --> 34:00.106
- What the hell is in these anyway?

34:00.106 --> 34:01.808
- I don't know, it says cannoli shells,

34:01.808 --> 34:04.088
but it doesn't smell
like no cannoli shells.

34:04.088 --> 34:05.042
- Throw it out.

34:05.042 --> 34:06.435
- No, it could be
something we need, alright?

34:06.435 --> 34:07.685
- Throw it out!

34:08.659 --> 34:11.190
God, no wonder you have no
more fucking room in here!

34:11.190 --> 34:12.937
- We can't just keep
throwing everything out!

34:12.937 --> 34:15.697
- Oh my God, what is this shit?

34:15.697 --> 34:17.315
Who am I, Gordon fucking Ramsey?

34:17.315 --> 34:18.786
- Shh, we have a customer outside.

34:18.786 --> 34:20.237
- I don't care!

34:20.237 --> 34:21.070
- We'll be right with you, sir.

34:21.070 --> 34:21.902
- Let me ask you something.

34:21.902 --> 34:22.851
How old do you think these are?

34:22.851 --> 34:23.821
- I don't know!

34:23.821 --> 34:25.012
- I dare you, smell it.

34:25.012 --> 34:26.918
- No, I'm not smelling that!

34:26.918 --> 34:27.751

34:32.780 --> 34:33.741
- The big one.

39:00.141 --> 39:01.864
You ready for that big interview?

39:01.864 --> 39:02.697
- Yeah.

39:04.085 --> 39:07.003
- You talked to your mother lately?

39:07.003 --> 39:09.028
- Yeah, just last night.

39:09.028 --> 39:11.144
- She doesn't want anything to do with me.

39:11.144 --> 39:12.831
- Give her time.

39:12.831 --> 39:16.626
- You know, as soon as I found Varya,

39:16.626 --> 39:18.111
I lost a sister-in-law.

39:18.111 --> 39:19.274
- You know how she gets.

39:19.274 --> 39:20.574
She'll come around.

39:20.574 --> 39:22.074
- Yeah, I suppose.

39:23.735 --> 39:25.568
- Come check this out.

39:31.251 --> 39:32.346
- Some nice shots.

39:32.346 --> 39:33.739
- Not bad, huh?

39:33.739 --> 39:36.126
But how do I get the music to stop playing

39:36.126 --> 39:38.437
over this so I can put a new song in?

39:38.437 --> 39:40.687
- You're gonna have to fade it out.

39:40.687 --> 39:42.052
- How do I do that?

39:42.052 --> 39:43.778
- Well, just like the
picture lengths, you know?

39:43.778 --> 39:45.995
Just change the music the same way.

39:45.995 --> 39:47.789
- Oh, so it's the same thing?

39:47.789 --> 39:48.622
- Mhmm.

39:49.562 --> 39:52.172
- Well, can you show me how to
do it so I know how, please?

39:52.172 --> 39:53.589
- Uh, yeah, sure.

39:55.221 --> 39:58.829
Alright, so, to fade this out
what you're gonna wanna do

39:58.829 --> 40:03.225
is drag this little ball in
the audio track to the left.

40:03.225 --> 40:04.058
- Oh.

40:05.591 --> 40:06.758
Okay, perfect.

40:10.454 --> 40:12.294
This is the song I wanted.

40:15.644 --> 40:17.811
- Yeah, that's a good one.

40:18.931 --> 40:20.736
- Alright, when I'm done I'll
show you the whole thing.

40:20.736 --> 40:21.993
- Okay.
- Thank you, thank you.

40:21.993 --> 40:25.243
- Yeah, you got it.
- No sneak previews.

40:44.612 --> 40:47.300
- I'm still getting used
to this red hair, you know?

40:47.300 --> 40:48.133
- You don't like it?

40:48.133 --> 40:49.074
- Oh, I love it!

40:49.074 --> 40:49.907
It becomes you.

40:49.907 --> 40:50.740
You look sexy.

40:50.740 --> 40:53.241
- Oh, don't use that word!

40:53.241 --> 40:54.074
- Why?

40:54.074 --> 40:56.560
I'm proud of my kids being sexy.

40:56.560 --> 40:57.393
- Uh!

40:57.393 --> 40:58.811
- It's better than having ugly kids.

41:00.032 --> 41:01.400
Okay?

41:01.400 --> 41:02.333
- Yeah, I guess so.

41:02.333 --> 41:04.886
- I mean, I was used to
you, you're entire life

41:04.886 --> 41:07.187
being a blonde, and now
you're this sexy redhead.

41:07.187 --> 41:11.108
- Uh, stop!

41:11.108 --> 41:12.441
- So how's Alec?

41:13.822 --> 41:14.905
- Alec?

41:14.905 --> 41:16.443
- Mhmm.

41:16.443 --> 41:17.443
- He's okay.

41:18.539 --> 41:19.539
- Just okay?

41:20.747 --> 41:22.057
- Yeah, just okay.

41:22.057 --> 41:24.197
He's like, he's really immature.

41:24.197 --> 41:28.364
I don't know if I could,
like, see a future there.

41:30.993 --> 41:34.096
- Well, honey, let me
tell you, guys are kids

41:34.096 --> 41:36.513
at heart they're entire life.

41:37.570 --> 41:38.835
- So I gotta be his mom now?

41:38.835 --> 41:40.561
- Ew, no, that's gross.

41:40.561 --> 41:41.757
God, no.

41:41.757 --> 41:44.551
But one of you guys has
to be a little mature

41:44.551 --> 41:47.081
and kinda, you know,
handle things a little bit.

41:47.081 --> 41:48.703
I mean, it doesn't mean he's not mature,

41:48.703 --> 41:52.430
it's just he'll be a kid
three-quarters of the time.

41:52.430 --> 41:54.167
- He still plays with Hot Wheels.

41:55.201 --> 41:56.868
He's 22, it's gross!

41:58.077 --> 41:59.054
It's weird.
- Oh, God.

41:59.054 --> 42:02.240
Well, just remember they
don't quite grow up.

42:02.240 --> 42:03.738
Or maybe they're just playing us, huh?

42:03.738 --> 42:05.703
Maybe they want us to
thing that they're kids

42:05.703 --> 42:08.182
so we can let them get
away with stuff, you know?

42:08.182 --> 42:11.281
Maybe they're using
reverse psychology on us.

42:11.281 --> 42:13.225
- Well, now I really don't wanna date him.

42:13.225 --> 42:15.459
- Oh, hang on, honey, give me a second.

42:15.459 --> 42:19.368
I just have to--
- What's, what's wrong?

42:19.368 --> 42:20.528
Do you want a glass of water or something?

42:20.528 --> 42:22.036
Do you want?

42:22.036 --> 42:22.869
Are you okay?

42:22.869 --> 42:24.143
- Yeah, I'm okay.

42:24.143 --> 42:24.976
I'm okay.

42:24.976 --> 42:26.129
- Are you sure?

42:26.129 --> 42:29.296
- Yeah, it's just, just need some air.

42:32.418 --> 42:33.251
Okay.

42:35.047 --> 42:36.130
I'll be okay.

42:37.883 --> 42:39.300
I'll be okay.

42:39.300 --> 42:40.470
Thank you.

42:40.470 --> 42:42.448
Thank you, honey.
- Okay, okay.

42:42.448 --> 42:43.855
- I love you.

42:43.855 --> 42:45.500
You know I always will.
- I love you, too.

42:45.500 --> 42:46.333
Yeah, of course.

42:46.333 --> 42:47.166
I know.

42:47.166 --> 42:48.822
Why are you talkin' like you?

42:48.822 --> 42:49.696
Don't talk like that.

42:49.696 --> 42:51.568
Come on, you're gonna be okay.

42:51.568 --> 42:52.401
- Okay.

43:12.488 --> 43:15.545
So when do you think you, um,

43:15.545 --> 43:17.090
take me maybe to the salon or something

43:17.090 --> 43:20.673
so I can get rid of
some of this gray hair?

43:24.113 --> 43:26.323
Maybe make me feel good about myself.

43:26.323 --> 43:27.156
- Yeah.

43:29.299 --> 43:32.015
Yeah, it'll be really fun.

43:32.015 --> 43:34.098
You look beautiful, stop.

44:03.445 --> 44:06.974
You know I don't have to be
at work for another hour.

44:06.974 --> 44:08.307
Wanna find Kara?

44:09.768 --> 44:10.851
- Yeah, sure.

44:11.769 --> 44:13.709
She's over here.

44:13.709 --> 44:16.020
- Really, I thought she
was by Saint Francis?

44:16.020 --> 44:18.537
- No, over by
the two trees, I thought.

44:18.537 --> 44:19.370
- Oh.

44:24.750 --> 44:26.004
Did you find her?

44:26.004 --> 44:26.837
- No!

44:28.888 --> 44:30.808
- I thought it was a family headstone!

44:30.808 --> 44:32.670
- No, it's just a plaque!

44:32.670 --> 44:35.318
♪ Ooh ♪

44:35.318 --> 44:36.151
- I said get out, get out!

44:36.151 --> 44:37.271
- You are freaking out about nothing.

44:37.271 --> 44:38.437
- About nothing?
- It's nothing.

44:38.437 --> 44:39.996
- Oh, nothing, really, really?
- Yes!

44:39.996 --> 44:42.033
- Explain to me how this is nothing?

44:42.033 --> 44:44.241
- Okay, so you were texting me,

44:44.241 --> 44:45.930
and then he texted me,
and then you texted me,

44:45.930 --> 44:46.796
and I got confused about--

44:46.796 --> 44:47.629
- That is such a--

44:47.629 --> 44:48.462
- No, it is not!

44:48.462 --> 44:49.538
- For this!

44:49.538 --> 44:50.371
- Yes, I was.

44:50.371 --> 44:53.649
- You knew exactly what you were doing.

44:53.649 --> 44:54.936
Get the fuck out.

44:55.769 --> 44:56.602
- Tommy.

44:59.738 --> 45:00.571
Fuck.

45:07.859 --> 45:11.363
- Hi, Tommy, I really need you to call me.

45:11.363 --> 45:14.939
I feel like I did not
articulate myself earlier.

45:14.939 --> 45:19.939
I, I am, I am so sorry, I
didn't mean to.

45:21.310 --> 45:23.358
I feel terrible.

45:23.358 --> 45:28.108
I understand why you're mad,
but just call me back, okay?

45:37.462 --> 45:38.646
- We have new information

45:38.646 --> 45:41.570
on that crash in North
Branford from last night.

45:41.570 --> 45:42.891
This happened at the intersection

45:42.891 --> 45:45.238
between Route 80 and Twin Lakes Road.

45:45.238 --> 45:48.733
The driver has been
identified as 22 year old

45:48.733 --> 45:50.859
Kara Gavin of Northford.

45:50.859 --> 45:53.965
A vigil will be held tomorrow at 7 pm at.

46:07.858 --> 46:09.516
- I can't find her anywhere.

46:09.516 --> 46:12.580
- It's alright, neither can I.

46:12.580 --> 46:13.776
Let's just go.

46:13.776 --> 46:15.616
- No, I feel awful.

46:15.616 --> 46:16.674
- It's okay, Tommy.

46:16.674 --> 46:18.383
We can come back.

46:18.383 --> 46:19.778
- She's gonna get so mad at me.

46:19.778 --> 46:20.611
- No, she won't.

46:20.611 --> 46:21.553
She's knows you're here.

46:21.553 --> 46:23.482
It's alright, Tommy.

46:23.482 --> 46:25.381
- It's there like, fucking, a directory,

46:25.381 --> 46:26.919
or someone we can talk to about this?

46:26.919 --> 46:28.564
- We can't keep going back and forth.

46:28.564 --> 46:30.419
- It's not alphabetical.

46:30.419 --> 46:31.568
I just can't fucking find her!

46:31.568 --> 46:33.613
- Okay, hey, whoa.

46:33.613 --> 46:35.382
Listen, you got an interview at three,

46:35.382 --> 46:37.602
I gotta go to work, we
have our shit, okay?

46:37.602 --> 46:38.474
Let's just go.
- Yeah.

46:38.474 --> 46:40.111
Yeah, why don't you
take me back to my car,

46:40.111 --> 46:41.975
and come back on my own.
- Tommy, no, don't.

46:41.975 --> 46:42.808
No, come on.

46:42.808 --> 46:44.878
Let's just go, alright?

46:44.878 --> 46:46.406
- Oh, God.

46:46.406 --> 46:48.076
This place is so small, she could be,

46:48.076 --> 46:49.377
she could be right there, you know?

46:49.377 --> 46:50.710
- Tommy, I know.

46:52.073 --> 46:55.550
I know.
- She could be right there.

46:55.550 --> 46:57.467
- Tommy, let's just go.

47:00.588 --> 47:01.421
Alright?

47:02.978 --> 47:04.933
- Yeah, yeah, okay, let's go.

47:04.933 --> 47:05.933
- It's okay.

47:08.949 --> 47:09.961
Want Dunkin'?

47:09.961 --> 47:10.794
I'll buy.

47:11.926 --> 47:13.009
- Yeah, sure.

47:23.395 --> 47:24.228
Hello?

47:25.064 --> 47:27.525
- Tommy, it's Angela.

47:27.525 --> 47:28.358
- Oh, hey.

47:29.457 --> 47:30.290
- Hey.

47:31.915 --> 47:33.425
I don't mean to bother you,

47:33.425 --> 47:35.287
but my cousin said that you came in

47:35.287 --> 47:37.173
looking for me the other day.

47:37.173 --> 47:38.423
- Oh, um, yeah.

47:39.865 --> 47:41.647
I was just, you know, at the restaurant,

47:41.647 --> 47:44.212
and wanted to say hi.

47:44.212 --> 47:45.129
- Oh, okay.

47:46.188 --> 47:50.352
I was just wondering,
making sure you're okay.

47:50.352 --> 47:51.185
- Yeah.

47:51.185 --> 47:53.352
No, I'm more or less fine.

47:55.306 --> 47:56.849
I had a job interview.

47:56.849 --> 48:00.359
- Oh, cool, how'd it go?

48:00.359 --> 48:02.264
- I don't know yet.

48:02.264 --> 48:03.181
- What job?

48:05.060 --> 48:07.452
- Technical director for an arts college.

48:07.452 --> 48:09.351
- Oh, that's nice.

48:09.351 --> 48:10.851
I hope you get it.

48:12.073 --> 48:16.434
Listen, I was just wondering
if anytime this week

48:16.434 --> 48:20.267
you wanna grab dinner
or a drink or something.

48:21.216 --> 48:25.966
Not like a date, just I wanna
see you, and catch up more.

48:30.572 --> 48:33.072
- Yeah, yeah, that'd be great.

48:34.636 --> 48:39.262
I'm kind of in for the
night right now, but, um.

48:39.262 --> 48:40.977
- Do you like Supreme?

48:40.977 --> 48:43.213
- Supreme Seafood?

48:43.213 --> 48:44.404
Yeah.

48:44.404 --> 48:46.680
I haven't been there in a while.

48:46.680 --> 48:48.178
Nah, that sounds great.

48:48.178 --> 48:49.345
- Okay, great.

48:50.533 --> 48:52.031
Four o'clock?

48:52.031 --> 48:53.114
- Yeah, sure.

48:54.077 --> 48:55.216
Yeah, I'd really like that.

48:55.216 --> 48:56.049
- Me too.

48:57.079 --> 48:58.012
Okay, great.

48:58.012 --> 49:00.138
Well, I'll see you then.

49:00.138 --> 49:03.105
Oh, you can text me, by the way.

49:03.105 --> 49:04.384
- Yeah, about that.

49:04.384 --> 49:05.924
How did you get my number?

49:05.924 --> 49:07.841
- I've had it.

49:10.177 --> 49:11.557
- Right.

49:11.557 --> 49:13.936
Yeah, I'm, sorry, I switched phones.

49:13.936 --> 49:14.936
- It's okay.

49:16.917 --> 49:19.347
Okay, well, have a good night.

49:19.347 --> 49:20.254
I'll see you tomorrow?

49:20.254 --> 49:22.594
- Yeah, four o'clock.

49:22.594 --> 49:23.594
- Okay, bye.

49:39.159 --> 49:43.792
- You know when you watch the
Titanic high you root for Cal.

49:47.900 --> 49:50.347
- You're out of your mind.

49:50.347 --> 49:51.396
Oh my God.
- It's true.

49:51.396 --> 49:53.590
- These fucking bullfrogs!

49:53.590 --> 49:54.423
- Hey!

49:54.423 --> 49:55.256
- Jesus!

49:55.256 --> 49:57.628
- What the fuck are you doing?

49:57.628 --> 50:00.711
- Get in.

50:02.112 --> 50:03.279
I almost died.

50:08.166 --> 50:10.025
- You guys smell
like a dorm room in here.

50:12.950 --> 50:16.082
- Why, why are you in the car?

50:16.082 --> 50:18.099
- My dad doesn't like me
to smoke in the house.

50:18.099 --> 50:19.574
- He's not home.

50:19.574 --> 50:20.574
- He's not?

50:20.574 --> 50:22.285
- How high are you?

50:24.322 --> 50:26.207
- Pretty high.

50:26.207 --> 50:27.232
I thought he was in the house.

50:27.232 --> 50:29.242
- No, I was in the house.

50:29.242 --> 50:31.036
- Well, who the fuck were you talking to?

50:31.036 --> 50:33.098
- I was on the phone.

50:33.098 --> 50:34.681
- Then where is he?

50:36.659 --> 50:38.452
- He's at the basketball game.

50:38.452 --> 50:40.279
The Branford basketball game.

50:40.279 --> 50:42.595
- Oh, shit, do you wanna go?

50:42.595 --> 50:43.468
- No!

50:43.468 --> 50:46.149
- That'd be so funny.

50:46.149 --> 50:47.999
Imagine us walking in there?

50:47.999 --> 50:50.151
- Oh, yeah, that'd be hilarious.

50:50.151 --> 50:53.068
- It'd be the best basketball game.

50:54.800 --> 50:57.361
- Anyway, what are you doing tonight?

50:57.361 --> 50:58.194
- Nothing.

51:00.648 --> 51:02.455
- Come hang with us.

51:02.455 --> 51:04.398
- Yeah, sure, we'll do it.

51:04.398 --> 51:07.015
- Why don't you smoke?

51:07.015 --> 51:08.677
- I get paranoid.

51:08.677 --> 51:11.365
- No, he doesn't, it makes him sad.

51:11.365 --> 51:13.013
- That's not true, I just--

51:13.013 --> 51:14.485
- Why?

51:14.485 --> 51:18.350
- 'Cause Kara used to smoke,
and he didn't like it.

51:18.350 --> 51:21.009
She was a bigger stoner than was.

51:21.009 --> 51:21.842
- Huh.

51:21.842 --> 51:22.675
- Yeah.

51:22.675 --> 51:24.061
- Oh.

51:24.061 --> 51:25.690
That's a pretty big stoner.

51:25.690 --> 51:28.431
- Oh, yeah.

51:28.431 --> 51:30.974
You remember,
do you remember when she

51:30.974 --> 51:32.985
almost hit something in her RAV.

51:32.985 --> 51:34.056
Oh my God!

51:34.056 --> 51:34.889
- Yeah.

51:36.147 --> 51:37.699
- It was the best night.

51:37.699 --> 51:40.975
We were all coming home from some party

51:40.975 --> 51:42.093
or something, I don't remember.

51:42.093 --> 51:45.681
And so we all pile in her new RAV,

51:45.681 --> 51:47.463
'cause it could fit all of us,

51:47.463 --> 51:50.441
and she turns the corner onto our street

51:50.441 --> 51:55.441
and we just hear this bump
and then the ,

51:55.915 --> 51:57.848
and we were like, oh my God.

51:57.848 --> 51:59.261
We all rushed out of the car.

51:59.261 --> 52:01.178
It was like that movie.

52:02.389 --> 52:06.434
And so my brother walks
around to the tire,

52:06.434 --> 52:08.351
and he goes, oh my God.

52:09.438 --> 52:11.024
And we go, what, what what?

52:11.024 --> 52:13.716
He goes, we hit a fucking boot!

52:17.364 --> 52:19.402
- Yeah, yeah, it was pretty stupid.

52:19.402 --> 52:24.333
- It was the,

52:24.333 --> 52:28.500
it was the best night.

52:31.385 --> 52:32.218
Oh, I'm pretty high.

52:32.218 --> 52:33.993
You guys wanna go inside?

52:33.993 --> 52:34.826
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

52:34.826 --> 52:36.376
- Okay.

52:36.376 --> 52:37.209
Alright.

52:56.432 --> 52:57.682
I'm movin' out.

52:58.902 --> 53:00.235
- Do it.

53:01.594 --> 53:02.712
- Wait, what?

53:02.712 --> 53:04.045
- Do it.
- Do it.

53:06.079 --> 53:08.579
- Wow, was not expecting that.

53:09.750 --> 53:12.602
- What were you expecting?

53:12.602 --> 53:16.635
- I don't know, some big,
like, no, don't do it!

53:16.635 --> 53:19.883
You can't afford it, we'll miss you.

53:19.883 --> 53:22.927
Aren't you guys gonna miss me?

53:22.927 --> 53:26.582
- You said moving out, not moving.

53:26.582 --> 53:27.415
- Oh.

53:30.057 --> 53:32.227
- Do you wanna move in with me?

53:32.227 --> 53:33.519
Cheaper.

53:33.519 --> 53:35.355
I don't have an extra room, but.

53:35.355 --> 53:36.688
- No, it's okay.

53:37.733 --> 53:38.566
I just...

53:41.850 --> 53:45.935
It's just, like,.

53:45.935 --> 53:47.102
It just sucks.

53:48.662 --> 53:50.824
My dad probably doesn't even want me here.

53:50.824 --> 53:54.822
- Hey, don't say that, that's not true.

53:54.822 --> 53:55.739
- Whatever.

54:16.363 --> 54:17.688
- She's passed out again.

54:17.688 --> 54:18.605
- Oh, yeah?

54:19.780 --> 54:21.897
- Do you think she's
really gonna move out?

54:21.897 --> 54:23.314
- Yeah, probably.

54:25.060 --> 54:26.477
- What about you?

54:29.355 --> 54:31.754
You can't live here forever.

54:31.754 --> 54:34.548
- I don't plan on staying here too long.

54:34.548 --> 54:37.305
I'll figure it out once
I, you know, get a job.

54:37.305 --> 54:42.138
But if I don't, it's down to
Delray Beach with my parents.

54:42.992 --> 54:44.746
- That would be awesome!

54:44.746 --> 54:45.579
- For you.

54:47.418 --> 54:49.633
- What are you working on?

54:49.633 --> 54:51.509
- Ah, it's nothing really.

54:51.509 --> 54:55.592
Found some old videos,
just looking through them.

54:56.750 --> 54:59.249
- Geez, you look the same.

54:59.249 --> 55:00.082
- Thanks.

55:02.331 --> 55:05.414
- Oh, pink was Kara's favorite color.

55:09.680 --> 55:11.119
Sorry.

55:11.119 --> 55:12.036
- For what?

55:13.006 --> 55:13.839
- Nothing.

55:16.020 --> 55:17.768
- Okay, alright, check this out.

55:17.768 --> 55:21.378
We used to put cups in the
sand down on Madison Beach,

55:21.378 --> 55:24.020
and we would throw ping
pong balls against the wind,

55:24.020 --> 55:26.365
try to hook 'em back into the cup.

55:26.365 --> 55:28.219
Called it beach pong.

55:28.219 --> 55:31.694
It's fuckin' impossible,
I only got it once.

55:31.694 --> 55:34.488
- Were you guys, like,
drunk all day there?

55:34.488 --> 55:37.259
- When we were a little
older, yeah, pretty much.

55:37.259 --> 55:40.593
But it was even better
when we were teenagers.

55:40.593 --> 55:42.215
You know, none of us had phones

55:42.215 --> 55:44.172
or anything to be distracted by.

55:44.172 --> 55:46.974
Well, I mean, you know,
we had the Nextels.

55:46.974 --> 55:48.944
- Oh my God, I remember those.

55:48.944 --> 55:49.838
- Yeah.

55:49.838 --> 55:52.059
- Those walkie talkie phones.

55:52.059 --> 55:53.476
- That's the one.

55:54.371 --> 55:55.289
Shit.

55:55.289 --> 55:56.122
- What?

55:57.236 --> 55:58.766
- It's gonna kick off.

55:58.766 --> 56:00.226
- What?

56:00.226 --> 56:01.618
- Yeah, there it goes.

56:01.618 --> 56:03.090
- What happened?

56:03.090 --> 56:06.093
- Nothing, I just got
too much shit in here.

56:06.093 --> 56:08.564
Gotta get it cleaned out.

56:08.564 --> 56:10.731
- Take it to P.C. Richard.

56:11.707 --> 56:14.946
- No, no, it'll be okay for a little.

56:14.946 --> 56:15.891
It'll turn back on.

56:15.891 --> 56:20.224
It's just the fun part is
seeing if I lost anything.

56:21.764 --> 56:23.181
- Can I kiss you?

56:24.547 --> 56:25.380
- Um, no.

56:35.026 --> 56:37.526
- I love you guys, all of you.

56:39.326 --> 56:40.968
Do you want another beer?

56:40.968 --> 56:42.551
- No, no, I'm good.

56:43.472 --> 56:45.805
- Okay, I'm gonna go to bed.

56:46.977 --> 56:49.559
- Oh, hey, do you need
clothes or anything?

56:49.559 --> 56:50.982
- I brought my own this time.

56:50.982 --> 56:51.815
- Cool.

56:51.815 --> 56:55.134
- Unless you want me to get
naked in front of you again.

56:55.134 --> 56:57.626
- That's not what I meant.

56:57.626 --> 57:00.122
- I'm fucking with you.

57:00.122 --> 57:01.160
Good night.

57:01.160 --> 57:02.827
- Good night, Holly.

57:26.163 --> 57:27.419
- How long were you waiting?

57:27.419 --> 57:28.674
- I just got here.

57:28.674 --> 57:29.698
- Okay.

57:29.698 --> 57:30.952
What's up?

57:30.952 --> 57:32.786
I remember that shirt.

57:32.786 --> 57:35.162
- Yeah, it's a classic.

57:35.162 --> 57:37.579
- You always had good shirts.

57:39.260 --> 57:40.267
- Hey folks, how are yous?

57:40.267 --> 57:42.074
Can I get you something to drink?

57:42.074 --> 57:43.007
- Can I get a Coke?

57:43.007 --> 57:43.840
- A Coke.

57:43.840 --> 57:44.673
- Just a water, please.

57:44.673 --> 57:45.506
- And a water, sure.

57:45.506 --> 57:47.490
- Thank you.

57:47.490 --> 57:50.446
- Oh, I have been non-stop today.

57:50.446 --> 57:51.701
What were you up to?

57:51.701 --> 57:53.115
- Absolutely nothing.

57:53.115 --> 57:54.415
It was fantastic.

57:54.415 --> 57:56.136
- Oh, lucky you.

57:56.136 --> 57:59.061
I took Joey to school,
went to get new glasses

57:59.061 --> 58:02.867
because I broke the shit out
of my old ones that I loved.

58:02.867 --> 58:03.700
- There you go, folks.

58:03.700 --> 58:04.533
- Thank you.
- Oh, thank you.

58:04.533 --> 58:05.435
- Would you
like to order right now?

58:05.435 --> 58:06.883
- Yeah, can I get the
lobster roll, please.

58:06.883 --> 58:07.866
- The lobster roll?
- Yeah.

58:07.866 --> 58:09.651
- Can I get the clam strips
with extra tartar on the side?

58:09.651 --> 58:10.484
- Extra tartar, would you like

58:10.484 --> 58:11.317
french fries with it, too?

58:11.317 --> 58:12.673
- Oh, yeah, those Cajun fries.

58:12.673 --> 58:13.969
- Cajun fries, sure, okay.

58:13.969 --> 58:15.925
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

58:15.925 --> 58:18.122
Let me see your glasses.

58:18.122 --> 58:19.009
- They're all right.

58:19.009 --> 58:21.908
My old ones were adorable.

58:21.908 --> 58:24.158
But they do the job though.

58:25.173 --> 58:26.331
- I like 'em.

58:26.331 --> 58:27.164
- Thank you.

58:55.141 --> 58:57.626
- So, what happened to your mom.

58:57.626 --> 58:59.876
You know, I heard she left.

59:00.854 --> 59:02.937
- She went to California.

59:03.916 --> 59:05.204
- Your dad okay?

59:05.204 --> 59:06.044
I don't wanna ask.

59:06.044 --> 59:07.666
- No, it's fine.

59:07.666 --> 59:09.092
He's alright.

59:09.092 --> 59:10.842
Trying to date again.

59:13.918 --> 59:16.577
- Did you see it coming?

59:16.577 --> 59:17.410
- No.

59:18.301 --> 59:21.318
My dad helped her get
a job with his friend.

59:21.318 --> 59:24.069
Three months later she
was fucking that friend,

59:24.069 --> 59:28.203
and six months later she wanted a divorce.

59:28.203 --> 59:30.675
Now she's in California with him.

59:30.675 --> 59:31.792
- Still talk to her?

59:31.792 --> 59:33.042
- All the time.

59:34.417 --> 59:35.644
- I'm sorry.

59:35.644 --> 59:36.977
- No, it's okay.

59:37.959 --> 59:39.811
But, no more me.

59:39.811 --> 59:40.811
How are you?

59:42.893 --> 59:43.976
Are you okay?

59:45.799 --> 59:46.632
- Yeah.

59:50.299 --> 59:54.216
- Listen, I know you
don't wanna talk about it.

59:56.083 --> 01:00:00.666
You probably were worried
that I was gonna bring it up.

01:00:03.354 --> 01:00:04.187
But just.

01:00:05.316 --> 01:00:06.158
- Ang, you don't gotta say, it's fine.

01:00:06.158 --> 01:00:09.075
- Just listen, just listen, please.

01:00:10.755 --> 01:00:11.988
I don't know, this whole time,

01:00:11.988 --> 01:00:16.057
I thought after seeing you
today that I would be thinking,

01:00:16.057 --> 01:00:19.302
you know, you're not you,
and it's sad or whatever.

01:00:19.302 --> 01:00:22.469
But I was wrong, no, you're still you!

01:00:25.696 --> 01:00:27.852
And I know that you're not the kind of

01:00:27.852 --> 01:00:29.852
person that.
- It's okay.

01:00:31.171 --> 01:00:34.254
- No, Tommy, I know she was horrible.

01:00:36.389 --> 01:00:38.797
I know she treated you like shit!

01:00:38.797 --> 01:00:39.875
- Ang, it wasn't that bad.

01:00:39.875 --> 01:00:40.708
- And you didn't deserve that.

01:00:40.708 --> 01:00:42.375
- It's not that bad.

01:00:43.659 --> 01:00:44.909
- Everybody talks about her like she's

01:00:44.909 --> 01:00:49.195
some fucking angel now, and you can't even

01:00:49.195 --> 01:00:50.878
talk about how fucked up she was to you

01:00:50.878 --> 01:00:52.843
because that would be rude.
- We were in college, that

01:00:52.843 --> 01:00:54.098
shit happens all the time.
- You never told anyone,

01:00:54.098 --> 01:00:55.064
you only told me,

01:00:55.064 --> 01:00:55.949
and then you move.
- It's not.

01:00:55.949 --> 01:00:57.790
- And I couldn't, I.

01:00:57.790 --> 01:00:59.064
- That kind of shit just happens.

01:00:59.064 --> 01:00:59.897
It's fine.
- I want.

01:00:59.897 --> 01:01:00.917
- I'm fine, Ang.

01:01:00.917 --> 01:01:01.917
- I worried.

01:01:04.735 --> 01:01:06.152
And I missed you.

01:01:08.618 --> 01:01:11.035
- What do you want me to say?

01:01:11.951 --> 01:01:14.055
- You don't have to say anything, Tommy.

01:01:14.055 --> 01:01:18.972
You just have no reason to feel
guilty now that she's gone.

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:26.493
- It's stupid.

01:01:26.493 --> 01:01:28.346
- It's horrible for everyone,

01:01:28.346 --> 01:01:30.809
but you gotta find some way.
- No, you don't get it.

01:01:30.809 --> 01:01:31.642
You don't get it.

01:01:31.642 --> 01:01:32.475
- Tommy, I do!

01:01:32.475 --> 01:01:34.478
- No, no, no, no one, no one gets it.

01:01:34.478 --> 01:01:36.645
You don't, you don't know.

01:01:39.479 --> 01:01:42.312
Fuck, nevermind, no.
- Talk to me.

01:01:43.410 --> 01:01:44.243
What?

01:01:47.195 --> 01:01:48.528
- When she died.

01:01:54.781 --> 01:01:55.614
- Hey.

01:02:03.599 --> 01:02:05.932
- I went with her, you know?

01:02:06.809 --> 01:02:07.642
Just...

01:02:28.087 --> 01:02:30.754
Um, thanks for dinner, you know?

01:02:33.296 --> 01:02:34.848
- No, I owe you.

01:02:34.848 --> 01:02:36.228
You didn't have to pay.

01:02:36.228 --> 01:02:37.383
- Sure, I did.

01:02:37.383 --> 01:02:38.216
Anytime.

01:02:42.284 --> 01:02:45.957
Let's just, um, let's not
talk about that, okay?

01:02:45.957 --> 01:02:46.790
- Yeah, okay.

01:02:46.790 --> 01:02:47.911
- Just.

01:02:47.911 --> 01:02:49.870
- I'm sorry I brought it up.

01:02:49.870 --> 01:02:52.274
- It's fine, it's fine.

01:02:52.274 --> 01:02:56.414
- Hey, do you wanna do
this again sometime.

01:02:56.414 --> 01:02:57.831
Not cry together.

01:02:58.672 --> 01:03:00.339
Everything but that.

01:03:01.234 --> 01:03:04.559
I don't know, grab dinner, drinks.

01:03:04.559 --> 01:03:06.226
You could come over.

01:03:07.205 --> 01:03:10.564
- Yeah, actually, I'd really like that.

01:03:10.564 --> 01:03:11.397
- Okay.

01:03:12.609 --> 01:03:13.851
I'm sorry I brought it up.

01:03:13.851 --> 01:03:14.684
- No, it's alright.

01:03:14.684 --> 01:03:17.792
Let's just, let's just
not talk about it again.

01:03:17.792 --> 01:03:18.875
- Yeah, okay.

01:03:22.657 --> 01:03:23.695
Get home safe.

01:03:23.695 --> 01:03:24.778
- Yeah, okay.

01:06:22.209 --> 01:06:23.957
- Shh, shh,
what's the matter with you?

01:06:23.957 --> 01:06:27.360
- Oh, hey, listen, Uncle Dom, Varya,

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.143
she's such a sweet woman.

01:06:29.143 --> 01:06:31.100
You're a lucky guy, you know?

01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:32.137
- You're drunk, Tommy.

01:06:32.137 --> 01:06:32.970
- Very sexy.

01:06:33.803 --> 01:06:36.665
Listen, my mom, I'm sorry
she's the way she is, you know?

01:06:36.665 --> 01:06:38.135
But she's gonna coming around.

01:06:38.135 --> 01:06:39.363
- Don't worry about it.

01:06:39.363 --> 01:06:40.196
Go get some water.

01:06:40.196 --> 01:06:41.055
Come on, let's get you some water.

01:06:41.055 --> 01:06:42.008
I'll help ya out.

01:06:42.008 --> 01:06:44.104
- Hey, Uncle Dom.

01:06:44.104 --> 01:06:45.484
- Alright, alright, alright.

01:06:45.484 --> 01:06:48.438
- Thank you for taking me in.

01:06:48.438 --> 01:06:50.807
- Alright, Tommy, how 'bout
some coffee or some Gatorade?

01:06:50.807 --> 01:06:52.357
Come on, you need somethin'.

01:06:52.357 --> 01:06:54.120
- This isn't gonna happen again.

01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:55.233
- Don't worry about it, you're fine.

01:06:55.233 --> 01:06:57.387
Tommy, coffee, Tommy, oops.

01:06:57.387 --> 01:06:58.220
Tommy!

01:06:59.223 --> 01:07:00.686
That'll work, go sleep it off.

01:07:00.686 --> 01:07:03.630
I'll see you in the morning, we'll talk.

01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:05.630
These kids, my goodness.

01:07:19.946 --> 01:07:20.779
- Good morning.

01:07:20.779 --> 01:07:22.029
- Good morning!

01:07:26.406 --> 01:07:27.239
- Oh.

01:07:46.377 --> 01:07:50.085
- Where is the, the towels, the towels?

01:07:50.085 --> 01:07:53.243
- Oh, uh, yeah, right there.

01:07:53.243 --> 01:07:54.474
Oh.

01:07:54.474 --> 01:07:55.307
Um.

01:08:00.119 --> 01:08:01.785
Heads up!

01:08:08.898 --> 01:08:10.065
- Really nice!

01:08:11.197 --> 01:08:13.612
- Well, what
kind of catch was that?

01:08:13.612 --> 01:08:15.099
- What kind of throw was that?

01:08:19.055 --> 01:08:20.256
- Shut up!

01:08:20.256 --> 01:08:22.935
- Hey, hey, hey, what's going on in here?

01:08:29.197 --> 01:08:30.029
What?

01:08:31.404 --> 01:08:33.523
- It's fine, nothing.

01:08:33.523 --> 01:08:35.706
- I thought you two were fighting?

01:08:35.706 --> 01:08:36.734
- Clearly, we're not.

01:08:36.734 --> 01:08:37.818
So it's fine.

01:08:40.014 --> 01:08:41.581
- You had to be there.

01:08:42.881 --> 01:08:44.800
- Marie, what
time you get outta work?

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:47.694
- Uh, seven, where's Tommy?

01:08:47.694 --> 01:08:50.028
- He's filmin' that baptism.

01:08:52.093 --> 01:08:53.343
- Alright, bye.

01:08:56.215 --> 01:08:57.868
Bye, I love you.

01:08:57.868 --> 01:08:58.826
- Love you more.

01:08:58.826 --> 01:08:59.920
- Mhmm.

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:03.102
- Have a good day.

01:09:03.102 --> 01:09:04.533
- What did I miss?

01:09:05.854 --> 01:09:07.529
What happened?

01:09:07.529 --> 01:09:08.363
Are you okay?

01:09:08.363 --> 01:09:09.439
Oh.

01:09:10.741 --> 01:09:11.633
I thought you guys were in a battle.

01:09:11.633 --> 01:09:14.300
I didn't know what was going on.

01:09:19.250 --> 01:09:20.479
- Who is it?

01:09:20.479 --> 01:09:21.312
- Hello?

01:09:22.549 --> 01:09:23.631
- One second!

01:09:30.068 --> 01:09:30.901
Tommy, hi.

01:09:33.564 --> 01:09:34.743
I've heard so much about you.

01:09:34.743 --> 01:09:36.520
It's nice to meet you, I'm Lindsay.

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:38.381
- Hi, yeah, who are you?

01:09:38.381 --> 01:09:40.743
- I'm a friend of Dom's.

01:09:40.743 --> 01:09:41.577
- Okay.

01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:45.524
- Sammy, did you say hi to your cousin?

01:09:45.524 --> 01:09:47.745
- Hey, Sammy, I didn't see you there!

01:09:47.745 --> 01:09:50.308
Where's your dad, huh?

01:09:50.308 --> 01:09:52.069
- He'll be here any minute.

01:09:52.069 --> 01:09:53.586
- Yeah, okay.

01:09:53.586 --> 01:09:55.418
- We're gonna go to
dinner and Dairy Queen.

01:09:55.418 --> 01:09:56.786
- Oh, fun!

01:09:56.786 --> 01:09:58.094
- Did you wanna come with us?

01:09:58.094 --> 01:10:00.594
- No, I'm good, but thank you.

01:10:02.097 --> 01:10:04.087
- I'm not crazy.

01:10:04.087 --> 01:10:05.004
- Um, what?

01:10:06.249 --> 01:10:07.082
- Nothing.

01:10:08.057 --> 01:10:09.436
- Yo!

01:10:09.436 --> 01:10:10.334
- Hey, babe.

01:10:10.334 --> 01:10:11.458
- Hey.

01:10:11.458 --> 01:10:12.723
Cousin Larry, what are you doin' here?

01:10:12.723 --> 01:10:13.808
- Hey, man.

01:10:13.808 --> 01:10:15.827
- Hey, sweetie, daddy's home.

01:10:15.827 --> 01:10:16.761
I'm gonna get showered and changed

01:10:16.761 --> 01:10:17.865
and then we're gonna go, okay?

01:10:17.865 --> 01:10:18.698
You ready?

01:10:20.959 --> 01:10:22.096
- Hey.
- What's up?

01:10:22.096 --> 01:10:23.254
You comin' with us?

01:10:23.254 --> 01:10:25.945
- Yeah, no, I just came by to say hi.

01:10:25.945 --> 01:10:26.903
- Bye.

01:10:26.903 --> 01:10:27.736
- Yeah.

01:10:34.998 --> 01:10:35.831
- Sorry.

01:10:35.831 --> 01:10:36.664
- Yeah, no, that's fine.

01:10:36.664 --> 01:10:38.158
- Hey, Cal.

01:10:38.158 --> 01:10:39.575
Yeah, it's crazy.

01:10:51.554 --> 01:10:52.613
- Don't say a word.

01:10:52.613 --> 01:10:53.446
- About what?

01:10:53.446 --> 01:10:54.279
- Come on.

01:10:54.279 --> 01:10:55.534
- Oh, you mean Mrs. Robinson?

01:10:55.534 --> 01:10:56.367
- Shut up!

01:10:56.367 --> 01:10:57.200
Seriously, I like her!

01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:58.628
- Dude, I'm just kidding, she's hot.

01:10:58.628 --> 01:10:59.963
- She's in the middle of a divorce.

01:10:59.963 --> 01:11:01.216
- Oh, there's the catch.

01:11:01.216 --> 01:11:02.701
- Calm down, it's fine.

01:11:02.701 --> 01:11:04.137
- Alright.

01:11:04.137 --> 01:11:05.587
Hey, man, I'll see ya later, okay?

01:11:05.587 --> 01:11:07.184
- Alright, bye, we'll catch up later.

01:11:07.184 --> 01:11:08.541
Take care.

01:11:08.541 --> 01:11:09.624
- Bye Sammie!

01:11:12.418 --> 01:11:14.925
- Hmm, Egyptian cotton.

01:11:14.925 --> 01:11:15.758
- Yep.

01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:20.133
- When was the last time
you washed your sheets?

01:11:20.133 --> 01:11:22.133
- Just about a week ago.

01:11:23.974 --> 01:11:25.141
Two weeks ago.

01:11:26.149 --> 01:11:27.792
No, uh-uh.

01:11:27.792 --> 01:11:28.709
I gotta go.

01:11:29.598 --> 01:11:30.717
I'm taking out Sammie.

01:11:30.717 --> 01:11:31.968
- Don't forget to wash your sheets, now.

01:11:31.968 --> 01:11:34.813
You can't go past two weeks,
you'll get warts or something.

01:11:34.813 --> 01:11:39.526
- Yeah, you've been telling
me that my whole life, Ma.

01:11:39.526 --> 01:11:41.312
What's that look, you
got jokes about Lindsay?

01:11:41.312 --> 01:11:42.667
Age gap?

01:11:42.667 --> 01:11:44.500
- I love who you love.

01:11:47.547 --> 01:11:48.380
- I love you.

01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:49.681
- Love you, too.

01:11:49.681 --> 01:11:51.514
You forgot your phone.

01:12:01.402 --> 01:12:02.819
- I'm moving out.

01:12:04.148 --> 01:12:06.862
And I found this really great
place over in Northford.

01:12:06.862 --> 01:12:10.083
It's really close, really
near where Holly lives,

01:12:10.083 --> 01:12:12.613
and so it wouldn't be too drastic, so.

01:12:12.613 --> 01:12:13.920
- That's great, Marie.

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:18.904
I'm not gonna stop ya if
that's what you really want.

01:12:18.904 --> 01:12:22.077
- Wow, just didn't think you'd...

01:12:22.077 --> 01:12:22.910
- What?

01:12:26.932 --> 01:12:28.806
- Do you even want me here?

01:12:28.806 --> 01:12:29.895
- Marie, are you serious?

01:12:29.895 --> 01:12:30.728
- Stop, no.

01:12:30.728 --> 01:12:32.109
I don't wanna be coddled right now.

01:12:32.109 --> 01:12:33.320
Come on.

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:34.528
- I'm always gonna be here.

01:12:34.528 --> 01:12:36.472
You're room is always going to be here.

01:12:36.472 --> 01:12:37.305
Everything is here.

01:12:37.305 --> 01:12:39.219
- No, Dad, you're not listening.

01:12:39.219 --> 01:12:40.461
- I am listening.

01:12:40.461 --> 01:12:41.912
- Should I say it in a Russian accent?

01:12:41.912 --> 01:12:43.050
Would you listen then?

01:12:43.050 --> 01:12:44.488
- Oh, is that what this is about now?

01:12:44.488 --> 01:12:46.113
- Come on, Dad!

01:12:46.113 --> 01:12:48.590
It's been two years, and
then Varya comes along

01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:51.387
and mom is just gone, and
I'm this piece of shit

01:12:51.387 --> 01:12:54.031
who can't seem to let shit go.

01:12:54.031 --> 01:12:56.239
And you're just erasing her,

01:12:56.239 --> 01:12:58.183
and I'm erasing myself from you, Dad,

01:12:58.183 --> 01:12:59.634
and it kinda seems like
that's what you want!

01:12:59.634 --> 01:13:02.045
- I didn't erase her!

01:13:02.045 --> 01:13:04.013
Look at my phone.

01:13:04.013 --> 01:13:06.346
Your mother's my background.

01:13:09.218 --> 01:13:13.095
- I just, I don't need
pictures to see her every day.

01:13:13.095 --> 01:13:14.486
I see her all the time.

01:13:14.486 --> 01:13:16.144
Every new patient, every new mother,

01:13:16.144 --> 01:13:19.812
every kid that comes in, I see her.

01:13:19.812 --> 01:13:21.524
I'm sorry, I didn't know she
was your phone background.

01:13:21.524 --> 01:13:22.857
I never noticed.

01:13:25.021 --> 01:13:26.021
- I'm sorry.

01:13:28.367 --> 01:13:31.539
- Why do we have to
remember her like that, huh?

01:13:31.539 --> 01:13:35.397
Why can't we remember her
like, like she wanted us to,

01:13:35.397 --> 01:13:38.302
like live like she wanted us to, you know?

01:13:38.302 --> 01:13:39.510
- A man needs--

01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:40.593
- Oh.

01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:46.192
- Varya makes me very happy.

01:13:46.192 --> 01:13:48.331
You make me happy.

01:13:48.331 --> 01:13:52.414
Even your cousin living
here is better, you know?

01:13:54.293 --> 01:13:56.460
- I just don't understand.

01:13:59.325 --> 01:14:01.992
- How can I explain this to you?

01:14:05.714 --> 01:14:09.482
Okay, remember Poppy had a
girlfriend after Nona died.

01:14:09.482 --> 01:14:12.280
- Yeah, Dad, five years after!

01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:16.197
- But he was happy, it's
the same thing, Marie.

01:14:25.423 --> 01:14:26.840
- I'm gonna move.

01:14:29.324 --> 01:14:32.824
And I really hope you can still be my dad.

01:14:33.668 --> 01:14:34.501
- Marie.

01:14:34.501 --> 01:14:38.468
- Because I can't, I can't
handle another loss right now.

01:14:38.468 --> 01:14:40.999
- Please, it's gonna be okay.

01:14:40.999 --> 01:14:42.416
I'm proud of you.

01:14:43.262 --> 01:14:46.345
Marie, I promise, it's gonna be okay.

01:14:47.991 --> 01:14:49.161
- I love you.

01:14:49.161 --> 01:14:51.661
- I love you, too, sweetheart.

01:14:54.255 --> 01:14:56.660
It's gonna be okay.

01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:57.493
Yes.

01:14:57.493 --> 01:14:58.785
- You think you can help me move?

01:14:58.785 --> 01:14:59.880
- With these muscles?

01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:00.838
- Dad.

01:15:00.838 --> 01:15:01.838
- Of course!

01:15:03.127 --> 01:15:05.080
Promise not to take my
popcorn maker with you!

01:15:06.402 --> 01:15:07.235
- We'll talk about it.

01:15:07.235 --> 01:15:08.068
- Okay.

01:15:08.068 --> 01:15:09.178
You know I like my popcorn.

01:15:09.178 --> 01:15:10.683
- I know.

- Good, how long is it gonna take, though?

01:16:26.681 --> 01:16:27.665
- Just like 15 minutes.

01:16:27.665 --> 01:16:29.019
It's already at 3% done.

01:16:29.019 --> 01:16:31.219
- Oh, great, thank you.

01:16:31.219 --> 01:16:33.219
- Yeah, you got it, man.

01:16:35.735 --> 01:16:37.186
- Hey,
how'd that job interview

01:16:37.186 --> 01:16:38.603
work out for you?

01:16:39.449 --> 01:16:42.830
- Yeah, I haven't heard
back from that yet.

01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:44.178
- You doin' okay?

01:16:44.178 --> 01:16:47.352
You've been out and about for a while.

01:16:47.352 --> 01:16:48.355
- Yeah, I'm okay.

01:16:48.355 --> 01:16:50.522
I've had a couple of gigs.

01:16:52.701 --> 01:16:55.118
- I know you miss her, Tommy.

01:16:56.828 --> 01:16:59.450
- Uncle Dom, we all miss her.

01:16:59.450 --> 01:17:00.367
- No, Kara.

01:17:02.210 --> 01:17:03.879
- Oh, yeah.

01:17:03.879 --> 01:17:05.794
- Tommy, you need someone.

01:17:05.794 --> 01:17:08.049
- I really don't, I'm fine.

01:17:08.049 --> 01:17:10.993
- Come on, get some cute
girl to mess around with.

01:17:10.993 --> 01:17:13.372
You're miserable, I get it, don't worry.

01:17:13.372 --> 01:17:16.111
But come on, Cousin Larry, what about, uh,

01:17:16.111 --> 01:17:17.080
what's the girl's name?

01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:18.927
The girl you used to
pluck the guitars with.

01:17:18.927 --> 01:17:19.760
- You mean Angela?

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:21.122
- Yeah, Angela, Angela!

01:17:21.122 --> 01:17:22.673
- I just saw her two days ago for lunch.

01:17:22.673 --> 01:17:23.506
- Yeah?

01:17:23.506 --> 01:17:25.075
Did you give her the old stromboli, huh?

01:17:25.075 --> 01:17:26.261
- No, I did not!

01:17:26.261 --> 01:17:27.525
- Did you give her the
capicola?

01:17:27.525 --> 01:17:28.904
- No, Uncle Dom, stop.

01:17:28.904 --> 01:17:31.218
Stop, stop it, it's not like
that, it's not like that.

01:17:31.218 --> 01:17:33.209
- Oh, look, I'm sorry.

01:17:33.209 --> 01:17:34.604
I'm just messin' with ya.

01:17:34.604 --> 01:17:35.554
- It's alright.

01:17:35.554 --> 01:17:36.833
- Do me a favor.

01:17:36.833 --> 01:17:38.732
I'm gonna go get cleaned
up and start cookin'.

01:17:38.732 --> 01:17:42.326
I want you to go to Krauszer's,
get me two fluffy rolls.

01:17:42.326 --> 01:17:44.240
Okay, the big fat wheat ones, alright?

01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:45.073
- Yeah.

01:17:45.073 --> 01:17:46.223
- They're on the second shelf

01:17:46.223 --> 01:17:48.814
on the second row, top, alright?

01:17:48.814 --> 01:17:49.647
- Okay, yeah, sure.

01:17:49.647 --> 01:17:50.933
- Second shelf, second row, top.

01:17:50.933 --> 01:17:52.071
Big fat fluffy ones.

01:17:52.071 --> 01:17:53.292
- You got it, Uncle Dom.
- You can't miss 'em, alright?

01:17:53.292 --> 01:17:54.125
- I won't.

01:17:57.732 --> 01:17:59.982
Hey, second row, top shelf.

01:18:02.583 --> 01:18:03.597
- Yes, the fluffy ones.
- You can't miss 'em.

01:18:03.597 --> 01:18:04.450
- I won't miss 'em.

01:18:04.450 --> 01:18:06.039
- Alright, drive safe.

01:18:06.039 --> 01:18:07.789
- You got it.

01:18:19.589 --> 01:18:20.589
- Where you going?

01:18:20.589 --> 01:18:22.454
- Gotta pick up some rolls for dinner.

01:18:22.454 --> 01:18:23.850
Hey, where's Sammie?

01:18:23.850 --> 01:18:25.653
- With her mother tonight.

01:18:25.653 --> 01:18:26.702
- What's for dinner?

01:18:26.702 --> 01:18:28.194
- Gabadels.

01:18:28.194 --> 01:18:29.378
- What's that?

01:18:29.378 --> 01:18:31.197
- Don't worry, it's good.

01:18:31.197 --> 01:18:32.249
- Hey, actually, I need you

01:18:32.249 --> 01:18:33.483
to move your car so I can get out.

01:18:33.483 --> 01:18:34.316
- Okay.

01:18:42.324 --> 01:18:44.849
- I know this seems kind of weird to you.

01:18:44.849 --> 01:18:45.682
- Not at all.

01:18:45.682 --> 01:18:48.507
Honestly, it was weirder when
he wouldn't talk about you.

01:18:48.507 --> 01:18:51.349
- It wasn't him.

01:18:51.349 --> 01:18:53.784
I just wasn't ready to meet everybody.

01:18:53.784 --> 01:18:55.222
- Look, as long as he's happy,

01:18:55.222 --> 01:18:57.120
I could care less, alright?

01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:01.929
- I know, but
older woman, younger guy,

01:19:01.929 --> 01:19:04.183
it just makes me look like I'm crazy.

01:19:04.183 --> 01:19:05.016
- No, it doesn't.

01:19:05.016 --> 01:19:06.496
Stop saying that.

01:19:06.496 --> 01:19:08.783
- I was worried what his dad would think.

01:19:08.783 --> 01:19:11.243
- Uncle Dom
is not one to talk, okay.

01:19:11.243 --> 01:19:12.724
Have you seen Varya?

01:19:12.724 --> 01:19:13.647
- True.

01:19:13.647 --> 01:19:15.303
Alright, I'll be right back, okay?

01:19:15.303 --> 01:19:16.959
- Okay.

01:19:16.959 --> 01:19:17.950
- Where's Varya?

01:19:17.950 --> 01:19:18.799
- She's inside.

01:19:18.799 --> 01:19:20.166
I think your Dad's in the shower.

01:19:20.166 --> 01:19:21.475
Just go on in, I'll be
back like five minutes.

01:19:21.475 --> 01:19:22.683
- Alright.

01:19:22.683 --> 01:19:24.340
Let's go.

01:19:24.340 --> 01:19:25.720
- Oh, Lord, we thank you for the food

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:27.968
we are about to receive.

01:19:27.968 --> 01:19:31.088
Thank you for my brave
and hard working son,

01:19:31.088 --> 01:19:34.183
who's as good a father as he is a fireman.

01:19:34.183 --> 01:19:36.284
Thank you for my beautiful wife,

01:19:36.284 --> 01:19:39.126
and my bright and talented nephew.

01:19:39.126 --> 01:19:42.806
We pray that he finds someone
to warm him up a little bit.

01:19:42.806 --> 01:19:46.346
We pray that Marie has
a safe night at work.

01:19:46.346 --> 01:19:50.007
And finally, we thank you for Lindsay,

01:19:50.007 --> 01:19:53.477
the only one who can get
Dominic off his phone.

01:19:53.477 --> 01:19:54.310
Amen.

01:19:55.984 --> 01:19:57.195
- Amen.

01:19:59.345 --> 01:20:03.038

01:21:29.286 --> 01:21:32.004

01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:41.187
This is exactly how you were standing.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.250

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:47.572
This is crap, okay?

01:21:47.572 --> 01:21:50.072
So we're gonna do it in front.

01:21:51.887 --> 01:21:52.720
Alright, I haven't warmed up yet,

01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:55.720
so bear with the first few, alright?

01:21:58.609 --> 01:21:59.442
- Woo!

01:22:02.204 --> 01:22:06.207
- See, it's because he
doesn't throw like a girl!

01:22:06.207 --> 01:22:07.703
- You do throw like a girl, though.

01:22:09.959 --> 01:22:12.119
- You messed up.

01:22:12.119 --> 01:22:12.952
Run.

01:22:12.952 --> 01:22:13.833

01:22:13.833 --> 01:22:14.666
What'd I do?

01:22:14.666 --> 01:22:18.499

01:22:19.524 --> 01:22:20.893
Oh, oh, what are you gonna do?

01:22:20.893 --> 01:22:22.052
- The kid needs to practice.

01:22:22.052 --> 01:22:24.005
We gotta go back, for the kid!

01:22:24.959 --> 01:22:26.038
We gotta go back!

01:22:26.038 --> 01:22:27.243
- The kid?

01:22:27.243 --> 01:22:29.380
- What the fuck is going on?

01:22:43.712 --> 01:22:47.879
- Okay, runner on third,
one out, suicide squeeze.

01:22:48.818 --> 01:22:50.279
Batter puts down a bunt.

01:22:50.279 --> 01:22:52.577
They throw it to home,
runner three is safe.

01:22:52.577 --> 01:22:53.947
They throw it to first and hit the batter

01:22:53.947 --> 01:22:55.477
who's running out of the running lane.

01:22:55.477 --> 01:22:56.727
How many score?

01:22:58.722 --> 01:22:59.555
- One?

01:22:59.555 --> 01:23:00.436
- You got it.

01:23:00.436 --> 01:23:01.518
- Smart kid.

01:23:01.518 --> 01:23:02.438
- That was a tough one.

01:23:02.438 --> 01:23:04.646
- I gotta drop him off at
his friend's for a sleepover.

01:23:04.646 --> 01:23:05.851
What are you doing tonight?

01:23:05.851 --> 01:23:07.875
- Marie just got a new apartment, so--

01:23:07.875 --> 01:23:08.820
- Oh, really?

01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:09.653
- Yeah.

01:23:09.653 --> 01:23:11.678
So I was going to go over,
eat dinner and hang out,

01:23:11.678 --> 01:23:12.511
just the two of us.

01:23:12.511 --> 01:23:14.112
- Oh, nice.

01:23:14.112 --> 01:23:16.251
- Hey, you should come.

01:23:16.251 --> 01:23:17.630
- Yeah.

01:23:17.630 --> 01:23:19.231
I mean, sure.

01:23:19.231 --> 01:23:21.702
God, I haven't seen her in a while.

01:23:21.702 --> 01:23:22.829
Are you sure, I don't wanna intrude.

01:23:22.829 --> 01:23:24.118
- No, no, no, you should totally do it.

01:23:24.118 --> 01:23:25.694
I'll text you the address, yeah?

01:23:25.694 --> 01:23:27.222
- Okay.

01:23:27.222 --> 01:23:29.229
Joe, I'll just be one second.

01:23:29.229 --> 01:23:31.812
- Hey, man, don't forget these.

01:23:34.019 --> 01:23:35.453
- Thanks for helping him out today.

01:23:35.453 --> 01:23:36.822
- No problem, it was a blast.

01:23:36.822 --> 01:23:37.655
Good kid.

01:23:38.618 --> 01:23:40.091
- Alright, I'm gonna run home and shower.

01:23:40.091 --> 01:23:41.678
Should I bring anything?

01:23:41.678 --> 01:23:42.818
- Just you.

01:23:42.818 --> 01:23:43.651
- Okay.

01:23:44.968 --> 01:23:47.135
And I'm just being honest.

01:23:48.841 --> 01:23:53.508
I don't know if this side of
you is gonna be consistent.

01:23:55.499 --> 01:23:57.661
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:23:57.661 --> 01:23:58.994
- You scared me.

01:24:00.048 --> 01:24:02.114
- I didn't mean to.

01:24:02.114 --> 01:24:03.614
- I hope it stays.

01:24:05.413 --> 01:24:07.891
Alright, text me the address.

01:24:07.891 --> 01:24:08.724
Okay.

01:24:08.724 --> 01:24:09.557
- I'll see you soon.

01:24:09.557 --> 01:24:10.390
- See ya.

01:24:14.311 --> 01:24:18.847
Don't say a word.

01:24:22.882 --> 01:24:24.007
- It's fine, though.

01:24:24.007 --> 01:24:25.500
Holly didn't tell you anything about this?

01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:27.110
- No, she didn't tell me.

01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:28.527
- Yeah, whatever.

01:24:32.459 --> 01:24:35.001
So you're happy here?

01:24:35.001 --> 01:24:36.400
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:37.901
- Yeah.
- Good.

01:24:37.901 --> 01:24:39.339
- I still gotta do laundry
at my house, though.

01:24:39.339 --> 01:24:40.514
My Dad's house.

01:24:40.514 --> 01:24:41.756
Never gonna get used to that.

01:24:41.756 --> 01:24:43.159
- Yeah.

01:24:43.159 --> 01:24:44.895
Hey, there she is.

01:24:44.895 --> 01:24:45.979
- Hey!
- hey!

01:24:47.357 --> 01:24:48.232
Ah!

01:24:48.232 --> 01:24:49.311
- Wait, where'd you park?

01:24:49.311 --> 01:24:51.126
- Oh, I just found a
guest spot down that way.

01:24:51.126 --> 01:24:51.959
- Well, there's one right here.

01:24:51.959 --> 01:24:53.234
- It's alright.

01:24:53.234 --> 01:24:55.203
How are you?
- Hi, I'm good.

01:24:55.203 --> 01:24:56.036
How are you?

01:24:56.036 --> 01:24:56.869
- I'm good.

01:24:56.869 --> 01:24:58.444
This is such a nice area.

01:24:58.444 --> 01:24:59.606
- I love it.

01:24:59.606 --> 01:25:01.651
- Yeah, so how are things?

01:25:01.651 --> 01:25:03.230
Congrats!

01:25:03.230 --> 01:25:04.736
- Thank you, and better.

01:25:04.736 --> 01:25:05.569
- Good.

01:25:07.251 --> 01:25:08.084
- Hey!

01:25:08.084 --> 01:25:08.917
- Oh, hey.

01:25:14.084 --> 01:25:15.509
- How's your dad?

01:25:15.509 --> 01:25:18.947
- Um, not the best, but whatever.

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:19.780
- I hear that.

01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:20.697
- You know?

01:25:21.738 --> 01:25:22.571
I brought this.

01:25:22.571 --> 01:25:24.466
I don't know what kind of wine you like

01:25:24.466 --> 01:25:25.299
or what you drink.
- I told her

01:25:25.299 --> 01:25:26.132
not to bring anything.

01:25:26.132 --> 01:25:26.965
- No, no, no, no.

01:25:26.965 --> 01:25:27.798
This is perfect.
- Okay.

01:25:27.798 --> 01:25:28.656
- Look at that, 2012!

01:25:28.656 --> 01:25:29.631
Wow.
- Yeah, it's pretty good.

01:25:29.631 --> 01:25:30.464
- Nice, yeah.

01:25:30.464 --> 01:25:32.185
- Yeah, let's go.

01:25:32.185 --> 01:25:33.622
- Yeah, let's go and see this.

01:25:33.622 --> 01:25:36.001
- Let's crack this open!

01:25:36.001 --> 01:25:38.290
- God, I want this place.

01:25:38.290 --> 01:25:40.248
- Uh-uh, too
late, I like my privacy!

01:25:41.838 --> 01:25:42.671
- So how's your brother?

01:25:42.671 --> 01:25:44.174
- Ah, he's good.

01:25:44.174 --> 01:25:46.435
Probably bangin one of the
Golden Girls right about now

01:25:46.435 --> 01:25:47.268
- She's not that old.

01:25:47.268 --> 01:25:48.125
She's like 40.

01:25:48.125 --> 01:25:48.991
- She's old.

01:25:48.991 --> 01:25:52.100
- 38, 39. I hadn't
asked it's rude to ask.

01:25:52.439 --> 01:25:53.272
- Thanks for clarifying.

01:25:54.789 --> 01:25:55.622
Yep

01:25:56.522 --> 01:25:58.746
Are you still
staying at your uncles?

01:25:58.746 --> 01:26:00.096
For the time being.

01:26:00.152 --> 01:26:03.735
