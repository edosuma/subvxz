♪ Good morning, USA!

00:34.625 --> 00:36.860
So, can I get you guys a drink to start?

00:36.894 --> 00:38.127
Iced tea, soda?

00:38.162 --> 00:39.462
Tap water's fine,

00:39.497 --> 00:41.898
and we'll take a basket
of your free-est bread.

00:41.932 --> 00:43.683
Dad, can we get an appetizer?

00:44.685 --> 00:47.086
Appetizer?

00:47.121 --> 00:50.073
Honey, good news, Hayley has
been made the Queen of Denmark.

00:50.107 --> 00:52.125
You better give Kingorva T an heir

00:52.159 --> 00:53.977
before he discovers
you've spent all his treasure

00:54.011 --> 00:55.411
on jalapeño poppers.

00:55.446 --> 00:57.931
I don't think he wants you
to get an appetizer.

00:57.965 --> 00:59.399
What's the big deal?

00:59.433 --> 01:02.035
The big deal is I'm the only one
in this family with a job,

01:02.069 --> 01:03.469
and it's a low-paying
government job.

01:03.504 --> 01:04.870
And your mom doesn't make a cent,

01:04.905 --> 01:06.923
but at least she lets
me have sex with her,

01:06.957 --> 01:08.925
which is more than I
can say for you two.

01:08.959 --> 01:10.159
Wait.

01:10.194 --> 01:11.461
Do you want us to have...

01:11.495 --> 01:13.796
No, but it wouldn't hurt
to offer once in a while.

01:13.831 --> 01:16.432
Anyway, I crunched some numbers
and with the way we spend money,

01:16.467 --> 01:17.901
we're gonna be broke in no time.

01:17.935 --> 01:20.537
We'll just share the grilled
chicken off the kids menu.

01:20.571 --> 01:21.905
And make sure you grill it...

01:21.939 --> 01:23.940
on the barbie.

01:23.974 --> 01:25.208
Pretty good, huh?

01:25.242 --> 01:27.510
Gina, consider that amazing
impression your tip.

01:27.545 --> 01:29.546
Because you won't be getting a tip.

01:31.498 --> 01:33.266
Well, Stan, I've got some news

01:33.300 --> 01:36.269
that might just put your
money troubles in the rearview.

01:36.303 --> 01:38.538
Guess who's getting
out of jail tomorrow.

01:38.572 --> 01:40.206
Charles Manson?

01:40.241 --> 01:41.875
He's gonna finish what he started?

01:41.909 --> 01:43.409
What? No.

01:43.444 --> 01:45.778
I'll give you a hint:
He's rich, he's obnoxious,

01:45.813 --> 01:49.515
and he loves showering
this family with gifts and cash.

01:49.550 --> 01:50.750
Max Jets?

01:50.784 --> 01:52.185
The one and only.

01:52.219 --> 01:53.720
Really?
Oh, my God.

01:53.754 --> 01:54.821
Crikey!

01:54.855 --> 01:56.990
Six years that guy's been
in the slammer.

01:57.024 --> 01:59.792
Wonder if I'll even recognize
him when I pick him up.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.074

02:37.314 --> 02:39.632
Max Jets, you're free to go.

02:39.667 --> 02:40.900
Great.

02:40.935 --> 02:42.368
Sorry to see you go, Max.

02:42.403 --> 02:44.203
You were a model prisoner.

02:44.238 --> 02:46.773
You basically just slept for six years.

02:49.310 --> 02:51.544
Ugh, I can't believe you guys

02:51.578 --> 02:54.080
always go along
with this Max Jets charade.

02:54.114 --> 02:55.581
It's just Roger dressed up

02:55.616 --> 02:57.583
in another one of his stupid outfits.

02:57.618 --> 02:59.786
Yeah, but this character's loaded,

02:59.820 --> 03:01.054
so he's more likeable.

03:01.088 --> 03:03.790
He's an annoying,
inconsiderate old douche.

03:03.824 --> 03:05.158
Last time he was here,

03:05.192 --> 03:07.827
dude borrowed my car and
returned it with no wiper fluid.

03:07.861 --> 03:09.462
I don't know what he did with it,

03:09.496 --> 03:11.097
spraying it all over town.

03:11.131 --> 03:12.765
Well, we're gonna have to suck it up

03:12.800 --> 03:14.801
because I'm tired of
living on the cheap.

03:14.835 --> 03:17.303
I'm done using dirty Kleenex
as toilet paper,

03:17.338 --> 03:19.372
and vice versa.

03:19.406 --> 03:20.540
He's here.

03:20.574 --> 03:21.607
Smiles, everyone. Smiles.

03:21.659 --> 03:22.792
Max.

03:22.826 --> 03:24.927
Don't get too close.
I got a cold.

03:24.962 --> 03:26.629
Ah... ah...

03:26.664 --> 03:27.830
Ah-choo!

03:27.865 --> 03:29.499
Max is back.

03:29.533 --> 03:32.218
You're so clever.
Spending mucus!

03:32.252 --> 03:34.721
Oh, Max, it's so good to see you.

03:34.755 --> 03:36.856
And it looks like
you still have your fortune.

03:36.890 --> 03:39.225
Please, when you know what
I know about Bill Gates,

03:39.259 --> 03:41.794
the money faucet
just keeps a-flowin'.

03:41.829 --> 03:43.363
Oh, great, because
I have some dental work

03:43.397 --> 03:44.464
I've been putting off.

03:44.498 --> 03:46.132
I could use some new school clothes.

03:46.166 --> 03:48.101
I have an alarming amount
of credit card debt

03:48.135 --> 03:49.902
that I've been hiding from the family.

03:49.937 --> 03:50.970
Don't you worry.

03:51.005 --> 03:53.339
Max Jets will take care of everything.

03:53.374 --> 03:55.074
But first, I missed a lot of elections,

03:55.109 --> 03:56.609
so I got to vote real quick.

03:59.146 --> 04:00.513
Stan.

04:00.547 --> 04:02.181
Aren't you tired of washing your face

04:02.216 --> 04:03.816
after every time you blow your nose?

04:03.851 --> 04:05.518
Let him vote.

04:05.552 --> 04:07.086
Oh, Max.

04:07.121 --> 04:08.538
Click.

04:08.572 --> 04:10.373
Democracy gets me hungry.

04:10.407 --> 04:12.775
What do you say we go out
to a nice dinner on me?

04:12.810 --> 04:13.876
All right.
Yeah.

04:13.911 --> 04:15.011
Appetizers.

04:15.045 --> 04:16.462
I'm so glad you're back, Max.

04:16.497 --> 04:17.630
Me, too.

04:17.664 --> 04:19.464
Oh, special election.

04:22.853 --> 04:25.121
You let him.

04:27.658 --> 04:30.293
Max, paying all our bills was one thing,

04:30.327 --> 04:32.328
but all these gifts...

04:32.362 --> 04:34.797
I mean my fur,

04:34.832 --> 04:37.800
these diamonds, Stan's grill.

04:39.903 --> 04:41.671
This is just the beginning.

04:41.705 --> 04:44.173
Hey, you with the ass
I'd like to take a nap on,

04:44.208 --> 04:45.441
we're ready to order.

04:45.476 --> 04:46.876
Oh, great, you guys.

04:46.910 --> 04:48.544
I'll get you the bread and ice water.

04:48.579 --> 04:49.612
Ice water?

04:49.646 --> 04:51.681
I want every soda and beer you got.

04:51.715 --> 04:53.783
You know what? Just bring us
everything on the menu.

04:53.817 --> 04:55.852
And while you're at it,
bring us all the menus.

04:55.886 --> 04:57.754
I don't want anyone else
ordering while we're here.

04:58.889 --> 04:59.989
And this is for you.

05:00.023 --> 05:02.125
I'm pre-tipping,
and if you like the tip,

05:02.159 --> 05:04.827
later on I'll give you
the whole thing. Oh-ho-ho!

05:04.862 --> 05:06.562
Very appropriate, Max.

05:06.597 --> 05:08.414
So, uh, what's the plan?

05:08.449 --> 05:10.083
You know, now that you're out of prison.

05:10.117 --> 05:12.051
Well, Stan, I'm a changed man.

05:12.086 --> 05:13.719
Now that I've been raped by some guys

05:13.754 --> 05:15.054
that actually know what they're doing,

05:15.089 --> 05:17.323
I just want to share,
you know, give a little back.

05:17.357 --> 05:19.659
So, you're gonna give
all your money to charity?

05:22.229 --> 05:23.796
I'm sorry.
I didn't hear you, dear.

05:23.831 --> 05:25.064
My ears aren't working so well.

05:25.099 --> 05:27.567
I got AIDS in prison.

05:27.601 --> 05:29.635
Hearing aids;
I should really use them.

05:29.670 --> 05:31.921
Then I might've heard that guy
who snuck up on me

05:31.955 --> 05:33.923
in the shower and gave me HIV.

05:33.957 --> 05:35.858
Anyhow, I'm not a young man anymore,

05:35.893 --> 05:37.810
and I just want to spend my money

05:37.845 --> 05:39.579
on the only people in my life.

05:39.613 --> 05:40.947
You people.

05:40.981 --> 05:42.248
You people?!

05:42.282 --> 05:43.516
Who are you calling, "You people"?

05:43.550 --> 05:45.218
Them.
Oh, sorry.

05:45.252 --> 05:46.886
I thought you meant the letter U.

05:46.920 --> 05:48.321
As in the "U People."

05:48.355 --> 05:50.423
I've been looking for them
for a long time.

05:50.457 --> 05:51.791
They live underground, you see.

05:51.825 --> 05:53.559
That's where the U comes from.

05:53.594 --> 05:54.861
They're hard to find,

05:54.895 --> 05:58.097
but if you find one, it is tasty.

05:58.132 --> 05:59.665
Okay.

05:59.716 --> 06:02.135
I need to get as far away
from this weirdo as possible.

06:02.169 --> 06:03.669
How about we all go to Spain?

06:03.704 --> 06:05.638
On me.

06:08.175 --> 06:10.476
Spain's gonna be incredible.

06:10.511 --> 06:13.146
I can't wait to be so close to Portugal.

06:13.180 --> 06:16.082
Morning, all.

06:16.116 --> 06:17.450
So, what's going on?

06:17.484 --> 06:19.318
We were just talking
about how excited we are

06:19.353 --> 06:20.586
for our trip to Spain,

06:20.621 --> 06:22.722
the birthplace of Mexican napping.

06:22.756 --> 06:24.290
Yeah, about that.

06:24.324 --> 06:25.691
I don't think we're gonna go.

06:25.726 --> 06:27.326
Oh, and all that stuff I bought you,

06:27.361 --> 06:28.494
I'm gonna need that back.

06:28.529 --> 06:29.354
What?

06:29.474 --> 06:31.700
Yeah, Gina says I've
been spending too much money.

06:31.820 --> 06:33.206
Gina? Who's Gina?

06:33.326 --> 06:35.067
My new sweetheart.

06:37.404 --> 06:38.668
You didn't gasp.

06:38.788 --> 06:40.928
That's 'cause I don't understand
what's happening.

06:41.048 --> 06:43.109
We just lost our sugar daddy.

06:43.143 --> 06:45.188
Oh, now I get it.

06:45.308 --> 06:47.481
Liar. You have no idea
what I'm talking about.

06:53.885 --> 06:55.886
Max, the waitress?

06:55.921 --> 06:58.489
Waitresses are supposed to date waiters.

06:58.523 --> 06:59.757
What the hell?

06:59.791 --> 07:01.425
How did you two even wind up together?

07:01.460 --> 07:03.427
Well, last night after my shift,

07:03.462 --> 07:05.129
I found him changing his diaper

07:05.163 --> 07:06.803
behind his Rolls Royce
in the parking lot.

07:06.832 --> 07:09.433
Those teriyaki wings shot
through me like a bullet.

07:09.468 --> 07:11.068
And we just really hit it off.

07:11.102 --> 07:12.670
We've been together ever since.

07:12.704 --> 07:14.472
Exclamation point!
Look at that.

07:14.506 --> 07:16.440
We're already finishing
each other's sentences.

07:16.475 --> 07:18.142
Well, providing punctuation,
but that's...

07:18.176 --> 07:19.243
A start.

07:19.277 --> 07:20.411
Hey!
Hey!

07:20.445 --> 07:22.346
Come on, honey, let's go buy you a car

07:22.380 --> 07:25.382
and some Botox
for your super-bumpy areolas.

07:27.302 --> 07:29.587
No way she could be interested in Max.

07:29.621 --> 07:31.856
Hot girls are never into guys that old.

07:31.890 --> 07:34.225
Unless they're after one thing.

07:34.259 --> 07:35.893
Fatherly advice.

07:35.927 --> 07:37.962
Do you seriously still
not know what's going on?

07:37.996 --> 07:39.296
Ehh.

07:39.331 --> 07:41.499
After all the money
we've let him spend on us,

07:41.533 --> 07:42.766
we can't just let him stop.

07:42.801 --> 07:45.302
So many secret elections.

07:45.337 --> 07:48.038
We have to convince Max
to get rid of Gina.

07:48.073 --> 07:50.975
Because she's gonna take all our money.

07:51.009 --> 07:52.910
Way to go, Mom;
you get it.

07:52.944 --> 07:54.745
I understand everything.

07:54.779 --> 07:57.781
There's still time
to save Des Moines.

08:05.423 --> 08:08.842
So Gina seems really nice, but...

08:08.877 --> 08:10.895
...there is quite
an age difference

08:10.929 --> 08:12.429
between you two and...

08:12.464 --> 08:15.733
...sometimes a girl
can seem interested,

08:15.767 --> 08:19.570
and I'm not saying she's not, but...

08:19.604 --> 08:20.738
She's a gold digger, bro.

08:20.772 --> 08:22.006
Don't be ridiculous.

08:22.040 --> 08:24.475
Wake up, leprechaun.
She's after your gold.

08:24.509 --> 08:26.944
I assure you, Stan.
Gina loves me.

08:26.978 --> 08:29.079
She hasn't asked me for a single cent.

08:29.114 --> 08:31.365
In fact, the only thing
she wants to do is sing.

08:31.399 --> 08:33.234
Which is why I built her this.

08:33.268 --> 08:34.902
What happened to the basement?

08:34.936 --> 08:36.035
Where's the water heater?

08:36.071 --> 08:37.238
Hey, baby.

08:37.272 --> 08:39.740
I've got my cans on.

08:39.774 --> 08:41.575
Yeah, you do, baby.

08:41.610 --> 08:44.778
"Cans" is recording studio
talk for huge breasts.

08:44.813 --> 08:46.830
Look, Stan, I appreciate your concern,

08:46.865 --> 08:49.667
but the love Gina has for me is pure.

08:53.538 --> 08:55.239
♪ My love is pure

08:55.273 --> 08:57.124
♪ Purely for money

08:57.158 --> 08:59.076
♪ Money from people

08:59.110 --> 09:00.544
♪ Who I don't love

09:00.579 --> 09:02.780
♪ Old men disgust me

09:02.814 --> 09:04.815

09:04.849 --> 09:07.851

09:07.886 --> 09:10.788
♪ Hands across America,
bitches. ♪

09:13.224 --> 09:15.292
I know what you're thinking, Stan.

09:15.327 --> 09:16.994
One take, no mistake.

09:17.028 --> 09:18.662
Slap it in the oven, easy bake.

09:18.697 --> 09:21.699
What do you think, Jeremy?
Is it a hit?

09:28.540 --> 09:29.740
I brought you guys here

09:29.774 --> 09:31.375
so you can get to know Gina better.

09:31.409 --> 09:34.044
I know you have your doubts,
but once you get to know her,

09:34.079 --> 09:36.914
I'm sure you'll see what I see.

09:40.802 --> 09:42.386
Breathe.

09:42.420 --> 09:43.787
Hey, guys.

09:43.822 --> 09:46.323
Hot enough for you?

09:46.358 --> 09:47.625
Listen, Chuckles.

09:47.659 --> 09:50.027
I know what you're up to,
and I don't like it.

09:50.061 --> 09:51.512
I don't know what you're talking about.

09:51.546 --> 09:53.330
Don't you?

09:53.365 --> 09:54.815
Kiss her, Mommy. Kiss her.

09:58.320 --> 10:01.322
Come on, Maxie.
It's too crowded in here.

10:01.356 --> 10:03.190
Let's go play some volleyball.

10:03.224 --> 10:05.292
You go. I'll have fun
watching you have fun.

10:05.327 --> 10:06.710
Okay.

10:06.745 --> 10:10.147
Hey, why don't you two
lovebirds kiss before you go?

10:10.181 --> 10:11.882
Love to.

10:20.592 --> 10:23.377
See, Max, she's repulsed by you.

10:23.395 --> 10:25.529
What? She does that
every time we kiss.

10:25.563 --> 10:27.648
She says it's because
she gets so excited.

10:27.682 --> 10:29.216
Max, are you okay with that?

10:29.250 --> 10:30.384
With what?

10:30.418 --> 10:32.753
Stop.

10:32.787 --> 10:35.789
It's like a damn
Dr. Dre video out there.

10:35.824 --> 10:38.325
I see what you mean.

10:38.360 --> 10:40.060
I've been an old fool.

10:40.095 --> 10:41.245
This is not right.

10:41.279 --> 10:42.413
No, it's not right.

10:42.447 --> 10:44.581
It's offensive.
Right in your face.

10:44.616 --> 10:46.383
What's happening?
I zoned out for a second.

10:46.418 --> 10:47.651
I can't do this anymore.

10:47.686 --> 10:50.037
Gina? Gina, can I talk to you?

10:58.947 --> 11:01.048
That's right,
bitch. Cry.

11:01.082 --> 11:02.282
No more money for...

11:02.317 --> 11:03.851
Why is he getting down on one knee?

11:05.453 --> 11:07.521
Please be a bomb.
Please be a ring bomb.

11:10.725 --> 11:13.827
You were right!
I needed to lock this down!

11:13.862 --> 11:16.230
We're getting married!

11:22.487 --> 11:24.555
Commissioning and defacing
this painting of Gina

11:24.589 --> 11:26.557
was a good first step,
but how are we going

11:26.591 --> 11:29.393
to remain the sole beneficiaries
in Max's will?

11:29.427 --> 11:31.228
We're screwed!
Once he marries Gina,

11:31.262 --> 11:32.896
he's gonna leave everything to her!

11:32.931 --> 11:34.164
I wanted to be rich!

11:34.199 --> 11:37.034
I wanted to be the first boy
to whack it on the moon!

11:37.068 --> 11:39.253
Well, then it's clear
what we have to do.

11:39.287 --> 11:41.655
We have to kill Gina.

11:42.424 --> 11:44.057
We can't kill Gina!

11:44.092 --> 11:46.643
Max will know it was us
and completely cut us off.

11:46.678 --> 11:48.445
Well, we gotta think of something.

11:48.480 --> 11:50.581
I want to be the mother of the first boy

11:50.615 --> 11:52.149
to whack it on the moon!

11:52.183 --> 11:55.185
Well, then the only way
to ensure we get that money

11:55.220 --> 11:58.555
is to kill Max before he gets
married and changes his will.

11:58.590 --> 12:01.625
You do realize that Roger is Max, right?

12:01.659 --> 12:05.212
I mean by killing Max,
you'll be killing Roger.

12:06.681 --> 12:07.777
Yeah.
Okay. Sure.

12:07.897 --> 12:09.583
Gotta break some eggs.

12:15.356 --> 12:17.452
- What's this?
- Our wedding cake.

12:17.731 --> 12:19.999
The ultimate tribute to my bride.

12:20.033 --> 12:23.736
Well, I'm sure it'll be
a nice change of pace for her

12:23.770 --> 12:26.505
to be at a party where <i>she</i> ends
up inside everyone else.

12:26.540 --> 12:29.275
It's been a while since my wedding.

12:29.309 --> 12:31.610
How much does a wife-cake
set you back these days?

12:31.645 --> 12:33.445
I told Maxie he didn't need to spend

12:33.480 --> 12:35.114
so much of his money on me.

12:35.148 --> 12:36.515
My dove, after we're married,

12:36.550 --> 12:38.183
everything that's mine will be yours.

12:38.218 --> 12:39.685
So it's really <i>our</i> money.

12:39.719 --> 12:41.403
Not until tomorrow!

12:41.438 --> 12:43.105
Oh, honey, look, I got you

12:43.139 --> 12:45.307
the best wedding singer
on the East Coast.

12:45.342 --> 12:46.475
He's gonna sing the "Thong Song"

12:46.509 --> 12:48.244
when Gina walks down the aisle.

12:48.278 --> 12:51.914
Uh, testing, one, two.

12:59.923 --> 13:03.392
Traditional, classy, subtle.

13:03.410 --> 13:05.077
He's gonna blow half of our money

13:05.111 --> 13:06.979
on this wedding alone.
I say we kill him now!

13:07.013 --> 13:08.147
Just be patient.

13:08.181 --> 13:09.949
Hey, have you guys met
Reverend Ping Ping?

13:09.983 --> 13:12.151
Max flew Ping Ping
first class from China

13:12.185 --> 13:14.119
and put him up at the Four Seasons.

13:14.154 --> 13:15.821
You'll be fine.

13:15.855 --> 13:18.757
Just thank everyone for coming,
maybe start with a joke.

13:18.792 --> 13:20.192
Something just occurred to me.

13:20.226 --> 13:22.227
Can you talk?

13:22.262 --> 13:23.462
You're right, Stan.

13:23.496 --> 13:25.898
We gotta kill that old
son of a bitch right now!

13:25.932 --> 13:27.299
You're gonna do it, right, Dad?

13:27.334 --> 13:29.585
Of course. I'm trained
in these matters.

13:29.619 --> 13:30.986
Got the background, the chops,

13:31.021 --> 13:32.421
the know-how,
the "Say Hey."

13:32.455 --> 13:33.656
Great.
Then it's settled.

13:33.690 --> 13:35.691
You kill Max, Gina's out of the picture,

13:35.725 --> 13:37.526
and we all split the inheritance money.

13:37.560 --> 13:39.728
Right, with an extra 30% for me.

13:39.763 --> 13:40.729
What? 30%?

13:40.764 --> 13:41.864
Standard killer's fee.

13:41.898 --> 13:43.999
I do all the work,
I get something extra.

13:44.034 --> 13:45.801
No way! I want the money!

13:45.835 --> 13:48.504
So do I!
I'll burn him to the ground!

13:48.538 --> 13:50.422
No, I'll do it.
Two to the head,

13:50.457 --> 13:52.625
dynamite up the butt, whatev.
How hard can it be?

13:52.659 --> 13:54.543
Idiots! It has to look
like an accident.

13:54.577 --> 13:55.911
Look, just leave this to me.

13:55.945 --> 13:57.279
You guys'll only screw it up.

13:57.314 --> 13:58.447
We'll see about that.

13:58.481 --> 14:01.317
I say whoever kills him
first gets the bonus.

14:01.351 --> 14:03.085
Okay, then every man for himself.

14:03.119 --> 14:05.287
And may the best killer win.

14:22.155 --> 14:24.189
What are you
two doing up here?!

14:24.224 --> 14:26.125

Mind your own business!

14:26.159 --> 14:27.860
You don't even know how to murder!

14:27.894 --> 14:29.395
You don't even have good murder stuff!

14:29.429 --> 14:30.863
Both of you zip it!

14:30.897 --> 14:32.464
Neither one of you are murdering!

14:32.499 --> 14:33.499
Mommy's murdering!

14:47.163 --> 14:48.397
Amateurs.

14:53.903 --> 14:55.070

15:19.312 --> 15:21.730
I was electrocuted.
I should be dead...

15:48.858 --> 15:51.460
I won't go back to packing
a cooler when we go skiing.

15:51.494 --> 15:55.798
I'm eating lodge food!
I need my $20 chili!

15:57.400 --> 15:58.467
Hey, guys!

15:58.501 --> 16:00.436
How about that Reverend Ping Ping, huh?

16:00.470 --> 16:02.971
Had no idea his accent
was gonna be so thick.

16:03.006 --> 16:04.373
Ha. Oh, well.
The Chinese are

16:04.407 --> 16:06.375
taking over this
god-forsaken planet.

16:06.409 --> 16:08.377
Might as well get used to it.

16:08.411 --> 16:09.978
Congratulations, Gina.
You did it.

16:10.013 --> 16:11.380
You got him to marry you

16:11.414 --> 16:13.315
and now the money's yours.

16:13.349 --> 16:16.185
From now on I'm gonna call you

16:16.219 --> 16:18.787
"Allied Nevada Precious Metal
Exploration Company,"

16:18.822 --> 16:21.023
because you, Gina, are a gold digger.

16:21.057 --> 16:23.125
Long way to go for that one, son.

16:23.159 --> 16:24.893
You watch what you say about my wife!

16:24.928 --> 16:26.528
It's okay, Maxie.

16:26.563 --> 16:28.797
I know what you think of me,
but you're all wrong.

16:28.832 --> 16:31.600
I didn't marry Max for his money.

16:31.634 --> 16:35.037
And that's why I insisted
on signing this prenup.

16:35.071 --> 16:36.338
What?!

16:36.372 --> 16:38.740
When the angels take my Maxie to heaven,

16:38.775 --> 16:41.310
I get nothing, nada, zilch.

16:41.344 --> 16:42.978
You have disappointed me.

16:47.250 --> 16:50.452
I would like to invite Max
and non-cake Gina up

16:50.487 --> 16:52.654
to cut cake Gina.

16:54.057 --> 16:55.090
We're terrible people.

16:55.124 --> 16:56.792
I feel awful.

16:56.826 --> 16:58.861
We owe Gina an apology.

16:58.895 --> 17:00.996
We were so blinded by our greed

17:01.030 --> 17:03.732
that we missed two people
finding true love.

17:03.766 --> 17:06.801
Just look at them.
So happy.

17:06.836 --> 17:09.070
Which piece do you want?

17:09.105 --> 17:10.539
You know!

17:16.429 --> 17:18.964
You know that's how I like to do that!

17:18.998 --> 17:21.366
This family will never again
allow money to corrupt...

17:22.402 --> 17:23.367
Oh, my God!

17:25.672 --> 17:27.306

18:10.717 --> 18:14.253
I Maximus Horatio Shamus
Benny and the Jets,

18:14.287 --> 18:17.456
of sound mind and body,

18:17.490 --> 18:18.657
choose to leave all

18:18.691 --> 18:22.210
of my assets and worldly possessions...

18:22.245 --> 18:24.379
to my son, Jerry Jets.

18:24.414 --> 18:25.480
What?

18:25.515 --> 18:26.682
Who's that?

18:26.716 --> 18:27.716
Me.

18:27.750 --> 18:28.984
Of course.

18:31.354 --> 18:32.454
You!

18:32.488 --> 18:35.324
Yeah, me.
But how?

18:35.358 --> 18:37.059
Counsel, could you excuse us?

18:37.093 --> 18:39.828
We have some private illegal
matters to discuss.

18:39.862 --> 18:41.763
Of course. Take your time.

18:44.601 --> 18:46.935
I don't understand.

18:46.970 --> 18:48.103
Allow me to explain...

18:48.137 --> 18:50.138
with marionettes.

18:57.747 --> 19:00.048
My nephew got in here.

19:00.083 --> 19:02.768
Screw it.
I'll do it with flashbacks.

19:02.802 --> 19:05.282
<i>My father
and I were estranged, so much so</i>

19:05.305 --> 19:08.273
<i>that we couldn't even be in</i>
<i>the same room at the same time.</i>

19:08.308 --> 19:10.125
<i>But he was so proud of Gina</i>

19:10.159 --> 19:13.111
<i>that he couldn't resist</i>
<i>introducing me to her.</i>

19:15.531 --> 19:18.116
<i>And then Jerry and I
started having an affair,</i>

19:18.151 --> 19:20.469
<i>and we did it, like, all the time.</i>

19:20.503 --> 19:23.205
<i>And we did it everywhere.</i>

19:23.239 --> 19:26.041
<i>Oh! My bed!</i>

19:29.045 --> 19:31.296
<i>Come on!</i>

19:31.331 --> 19:34.166
<i>I convinced Max to
patch things up with Jerry</i>

19:34.200 --> 19:37.636
<i>and leave him everything in his will.</i>

19:37.670 --> 19:39.504
Oop! I got 'em untangled.
I'll take it

19:39.539 --> 19:40.822
from here, darling!

19:40.857 --> 19:44.276
Then Gina put poison in the cake
and fed it to my dear old dad.

19:47.697 --> 19:48.780
Damn it!

19:48.815 --> 19:51.316
I signed the prenup
so no one would suspect me.

19:51.351 --> 19:54.453
Now Gina and I have my father's fortune

19:54.487 --> 19:56.154
and we can live happily ever after.

19:56.189 --> 19:59.024
Farewell, you penniless fools!

20:07.600 --> 20:09.601
So, have you decided?

20:09.635 --> 20:12.771
Um, I see it says kids eat free?

20:12.805 --> 20:15.140
Does that include kids at heart?

20:15.174 --> 20:17.676
Yes, it does.

20:17.710 --> 20:19.077
Yippee!

20:19.112 --> 20:20.979
Four koala kids' meals.

20:25.184 --> 20:26.418
What's up, homies?

20:26.452 --> 20:28.086
Roger, what are you doing here?

20:28.121 --> 20:30.222
Aren't you traveling
the world as Jerry Jets?

20:30.256 --> 20:31.690
Yeah, about that.

20:31.724 --> 20:34.359
Turns out Gina was even more
evil than I thought.

20:34.394 --> 20:37.929
She killed Jerry for his money.
Beat him down with an oar.

20:37.964 --> 20:39.531
Blood everywhere.
Gruesome. Sexy.

20:39.565 --> 20:41.416
But <i>you're</i> Jerry.

20:41.451 --> 20:42.584
Uh-huh.

20:42.618 --> 20:45.370
So how could she kill Jerry,
who was you,

20:45.405 --> 20:47.572
without killing you?

20:47.607 --> 20:49.708
And how did Max die without you dying?

20:49.742 --> 20:52.238
You know what?
I would love, love

20:52.358 --> 20:53.959
to explain all of it to you,

20:53.993 --> 20:55.427
but we're out of time.
