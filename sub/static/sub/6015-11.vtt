00:02.569 --> 00:04.002
Every mall has a Hoffritz in it.

00:05.489 --> 00:08.322
That's got to be a scary place
to work. I don't know how you feel.

00:08.489 --> 00:10.445
Do you want to stand there
having people going:

00:10.609 --> 00:13.043
"I need knives.
I need more knives.

00:13.209 --> 00:15.120
Do you have any bigger knives?

00:15.289 --> 00:17.757
I'd like a bigger knife.
A big, long, sharp knife.

00:17.929 --> 00:20.489
That's what I'm in the market for.
I like them really sharp.

00:20.649 --> 00:22.480
Do you have one
with hooks and gouges...

00:22.649 --> 00:25.288
...and blades
that are kind of serrated?

00:25.449 --> 00:27.917
That's the kind of knife
I'm looking for.

00:28.209 --> 00:30.723
I need one I can throw.
I need one I can hack away with.

00:30.889 --> 00:33.039
Do you have anything like that?"

00:42.569 --> 00:44.321
Like you know
what you're talking about.

00:44.489 --> 00:45.683
Oh, no. You do?

00:46.249 --> 00:48.968
Well, what do you think,
they put the statue on a giant raft...

00:49.129 --> 00:52.007
...and a tugboat pulled it
all the way from France?

00:53.689 --> 00:55.202
Think they brought it in pieces...

00:55.369 --> 00:58.008
...and screwed it together
like a coffee table?

00:58.169 --> 01:00.967
What's going on? It's a little early
for a Christmas party.

01:01.129 --> 01:03.768
- Why'd France give that to us anyway?
- It was a gift.

01:03.929 --> 01:05.601
Countries just exchange gifts
like that?

01:05.769 --> 01:07.839
If they like each other.

01:08.129 --> 01:10.359
- There's Elaine.
- See that guy she's talking with?

01:10.529 --> 01:12.759
- That's her new boyfriend.
- Really?

01:12.929 --> 01:14.681
He works here in the office?

01:14.849 --> 01:17.602
They're having a little fling,
so don't say anything to anyone.

01:19.049 --> 01:22.246
Who am I gonna tell, my mother?
Like I have nothing better to talk about.

01:22.409 --> 01:24.081
You don't.

01:25.449 --> 01:27.041
He's a recovering alcoholic.

01:27.409 --> 01:30.207
- Really?
- He's been off the wagon two years.

01:30.569 --> 01:33.208
- "Off the wagon"?
- I think it's "off the wagon."

01:34.089 --> 01:36.000
I think it's "on the wagon."

01:36.169 --> 01:39.206
Jerry, George,
what are you doing here?

01:39.369 --> 01:41.121
What am I doing here?

01:42.729 --> 01:46.642
My God! My watch!
You found my watch.

01:46.809 --> 01:49.164
Keep your hands to yourself
if you know what's good for you.

01:49.409 --> 01:51.525
- Where'd you find it?
- Under the sofa cushion.

01:51.769 --> 01:55.284
- You stopped by just to give it to me?
- It's your Christmas present.

01:57.129 --> 01:59.768
- I thought I'd never find it.
- Today's your lucky day.

02:00.049 --> 02:01.880
No, today is your lucky day.

02:02.209 --> 02:04.882
- It would be my first one.
- You want to work here?

02:05.049 --> 02:07.005
- What?
- Yeah. One of the readers just left.

02:07.169 --> 02:09.080
There's a job opening.

02:09.249 --> 02:11.001
Dick, this is Jerry.
And this is George.

02:11.169 --> 02:13.399
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Is this the guy?

02:13.769 --> 02:15.407
"The guy"?

02:17.609 --> 02:19.645
- Dick.
- How can you just get it?

02:19.809 --> 02:21.640
My boss said to find someone.
I'm in charge.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.765
All you have to do is meet him.
Come on.

02:23.929 --> 02:25.920
- No, come on. Hold my drink.
- Cranberry juice?

02:26.089 --> 02:28.398
And vodka. Come on.

02:29.129 --> 02:31.518
I got the cranberry juice.

02:32.329 --> 02:34.001
So...

02:34.169 --> 02:36.524
...you're Jerry.
- So...

02:36.689 --> 02:38.441
...l'm Jerry.

02:39.169 --> 02:41.160
So have you ever done
this kind of work before?

02:42.289 --> 02:46.441
Well, you know, book reports,
that kind of stuff.

02:50.409 --> 02:53.128
- Who do you read?
- I like Mike Lupica.

02:54.369 --> 02:55.722
Mike Lupica?

02:55.889 --> 02:58.562
He's a sportswriter
for the Daily News.

02:58.729 --> 03:01.687
- I find him very insightful.
- No, I mean authors.

03:05.089 --> 03:06.727
Well...

03:06.889 --> 03:10.404
...a lot of good ones.
Lot of good ones.

03:10.569 --> 03:12.082
I don't even wanna
mention anybody...

03:12.249 --> 03:14.558
...because I'm afraid I'm gonna
leave somebody out.

03:14.729 --> 03:16.959
- Name a couple.
- Who do I like?

03:17.529 --> 03:22.080
I like Art Vandalay.

03:23.209 --> 03:26.201
- Art Vandalay?
- He's an obscure writer.

03:26.369 --> 03:29.088
Beatnik, you know, from the village.

03:29.449 --> 03:30.882
What's he written?

03:31.049 --> 03:32.880
Venetian Blinds.

03:33.609 --> 03:36.521
I got news for you.
I'm funnier than you are.

03:36.689 --> 03:39.157
Why don't we get together New Year's,
watch some football?

03:39.329 --> 03:41.718
- Where's my drink?
- There. So how'd it go?

03:41.889 --> 03:43.720
I think he's impressed.

03:46.729 --> 03:48.560
No, no, this is just cranberry juice.

03:52.089 --> 03:54.080
I think maybe Dick picked up yours.

03:54.729 --> 03:56.162
Dick?

03:56.649 --> 04:00.562
He can't drink. He's an alcoholic.
I told you to hold it.

04:00.729 --> 04:03.482
I didn't know you meant hold it.
I thought you meant hold it.

04:05.129 --> 04:07.689
One drink like that,
and he could fall right off the wagon.

04:07.849 --> 04:09.282
Told you.

04:14.209 --> 04:16.564
I never feel comfortable
in the women's department.

04:16.728 --> 04:20.404
I feel like I'm just a little too close
to trying on a dress.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.641
Do I really have to
buy her something?

04:22.809 --> 04:26.484
The woman got you a job.
Least you could do is buy her a gift.

04:26.649 --> 04:28.162
How about this?

04:28.329 --> 04:31.127
- What is that, cashmere?
- Yeah. She loves cashmere.

04:31.289 --> 04:32.642
Who doesn't like cashmere?

04:32.809 --> 04:35.642
Find me one person that doesn't
like cashmere. It's too expensive.

04:36.049 --> 04:39.325
Wow, look at this.
It's $85, marked down from 600.

04:41.649 --> 04:42.877
- Excuse me, miss?
- Yes.

04:43.049 --> 04:45.165
How come this sweater's only $85?

04:45.329 --> 04:47.524
Oh, here. This is why.

04:48.129 --> 04:50.962
- What? I don't see anything.
- See this red dot?

04:51.129 --> 04:52.881
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, it's damaged.

04:53.049 --> 04:55.005
It's not really damaged.

04:55.169 --> 04:56.761
Wow. $85?

04:56.929 --> 04:59.363
There's no exchanges on this.

04:59.889 --> 05:02.164
- Think she'd care about the dot?
- It's hard to say.

05:02.329 --> 05:04.160
I don't think she'd notice.
Can you see it?

05:04.329 --> 05:06.320
- Well, I can see it.
- But you know where it is.

05:06.489 --> 05:10.562
- What do you want me to do, not look?
- Pretend you didn't know it was there.

05:10.729 --> 05:12.481
- Can you see it?
- It's hard to pretend...

05:12.649 --> 05:15.527
...because I know where it is.
- Can't you take an overview?

05:15.689 --> 05:17.088
You want me to take an overview?

05:17.249 --> 05:18.841
I see a cheap man
holding a sweater...

05:19.009 --> 05:22.206
...trying to get away with something.
That's my overview.

05:25.209 --> 05:29.282
- Yeah, so?
- He's acting very strangely.

05:29.449 --> 05:31.599
I think he started drinking again.

05:31.769 --> 05:34.329
- Oh, boy. Can you smell it?
- No, I can't smell it.

05:34.489 --> 05:36.764
If you can't smell it,
then he hasn't been drinking.

05:36.929 --> 05:39.682
- You don't always smell from a drink.
- Yes, you do.

05:39.849 --> 05:42.363
What about one drink?
Would you smell from one drink?

05:42.529 --> 05:44.201
Yes, you would.

05:47.049 --> 05:48.277
- I'll prove it.
- How?

05:48.449 --> 05:50.167
- Would you do me a favour?
- Okay.

05:50.329 --> 05:52.718
Would you take a drink,
and let us smell you?

05:53.529 --> 05:56.168
You can smell me without the drink.

05:56.969 --> 05:58.846
No, no.

05:59.569 --> 06:03.357
I suspect that this guy I'm seeing
might be drinking, but I can't smell it.

06:03.529 --> 06:05.963
- Come on.
- Okay. Well, what am I drinking?

06:06.129 --> 06:09.121
I got a bottle of Scotch my uncle
gave me. Hennigan's.

06:09.289 --> 06:12.167
It's been there two years.
I've been using it as a paint thinner.

06:17.329 --> 06:18.842
All right.

06:24.209 --> 06:27.406
- I don't smell anything.
- We're too close to the bottle.

06:30.169 --> 06:31.363
- Yeah?
- It's George.

06:31.529 --> 06:34.919
- Come on up.
- That is damn good Scotch.

06:36.049 --> 06:38.517
I could do a commercial
for this stuff.

06:41.489 --> 06:44.367
Boy, that Hennigan
goes down smooth...

06:45.009 --> 06:47.477
...and afterwards,
you don't even smell.

06:48.809 --> 06:52.358
That's right, folks. I just had three
shots of Hennigan's, and I don't smell.

06:53.329 --> 06:55.763
Imagine, you can walk around
drunk all day.

06:55.929 --> 06:59.604
That's Hennigan's,
the no-smell, no-tell Scotch.

07:00.849 --> 07:03.602
- Hello, everybody.
- Hey, George, come here.

07:03.769 --> 07:06.203
I'm gonna tell you what I think.

07:06.369 --> 07:08.883
I know you don't care what I think,
but I'm gonna tell you.

07:09.289 --> 07:12.645
I think that you are terrific.

07:13.089 --> 07:14.727
That's all.

07:17.329 --> 07:18.887
Thank you.

07:21.129 --> 07:23.848
- Hey, what's that?
- It's an early Christmas present.

07:24.009 --> 07:25.522
- A Christmas present?
- That's right.

07:25.689 --> 07:27.281
- For who?
- For you.

07:28.209 --> 07:29.608
Get out of here.

07:30.409 --> 07:32.843
Say you got a big job interview
and you're nervous.

07:33.009 --> 07:34.920
Throw back a couple of shots
of Hennigan's...

07:35.089 --> 07:38.161
...and you'll be as loose as a goose
and ready to roll in no time.

07:38.329 --> 07:41.287
And because it's odourless,
why, it'll be our little secret.

07:44.289 --> 07:45.278
Kramer.

07:46.569 --> 07:48.560
Yeah. That'll do.

07:50.849 --> 07:55.286
Oh, George, this is beautiful.
Is this cashmere?

07:55.449 --> 07:59.203
- Of course it's cashmere.
- Oh, I love cashmere.

07:59.369 --> 08:01.519
- Who doesn't?
- Oh, my God.

08:01.689 --> 08:03.805
George, this must have
cost a fortune.

08:04.049 --> 08:05.926
Money.

08:06.129 --> 08:08.643
Jerry, how could you
let him spend so much?

08:08.809 --> 08:10.242
I tried to stop him.

08:11.689 --> 08:15.443
I couldn't. He just wants
to make people happy.

08:16.209 --> 08:19.804
George, this is one of the nicest
things anyone has ever given me.

08:19.969 --> 08:22.961
Good. Good. Listen, take it off.
You're gonna wear it out already.

08:23.129 --> 08:24.926
It's for special occasions, this thing.

08:27.369 --> 08:29.929
What's that red dot
on your sweater?

08:34.129 --> 08:35.357
- What?
- Listen, take it off.

08:35.529 --> 08:37.599
I'm getting hot just looking at it.

08:37.769 --> 08:40.236
What is this?
It's like a red dot.

08:40.409 --> 08:42.479
What? What red dot?
What are you talking about?

08:42.649 --> 08:46.119
Jerry, come here for a second.
Do you see anything here?

08:46.809 --> 08:48.481
I don't know.

08:49.169 --> 08:50.568
I don't know.

08:52.129 --> 08:54.359
- What don't you know?
- I don't know.

08:55.689 --> 08:58.249
Well, do you see it, or don't you?

08:59.729 --> 09:01.208
Say that again.

09:01.769 --> 09:04.078
Do you see it, or don't you?

09:04.249 --> 09:09.039
Do I see it or don't I?
That's the question.

09:23.769 --> 09:25.441
Now, what did you ask me again?

09:39.289 --> 09:41.678
You're still here?
You're a dynamo.

09:41.849 --> 09:45.285
- I can't believe I get paid for this.
- God.

09:47.089 --> 09:48.442
I'll see you tomorrow.

09:55.449 --> 09:57.121
- How you doing?
- Hello.

10:07.689 --> 10:11.887
You had sex with the cleaning woman
on your desk?

10:12.409 --> 10:14.559
Who are you?
How did you do that?

10:15.689 --> 10:16.963
Hennigan's.

10:17.929 --> 10:18.918
Hennigan's?

10:19.089 --> 10:23.002
I was sitting there in the office,
and the cleaning woman comes in.

10:23.169 --> 10:25.967
I've always been attracted
to cleaning women.

10:26.689 --> 10:29.999
Cleaning women, chambermaids...

10:30.249 --> 10:33.207
Yeah, chambermaids,
I'm attracted to them too.

10:33.769 --> 10:35.839
- Why is that?
- It's a woman in your room.

10:39.049 --> 10:41.802
- So go ahead.
- So...

10:41.969 --> 10:47.362
...she starts vacuuming,
back and forth, back and forth...

10:47.529 --> 10:49.759
...her hips swivelling...

10:49.929 --> 10:51.999
...her breasts...

10:52.489 --> 10:54.366
Convulsing?

10:55.049 --> 10:58.007
- Convulsing?
- I don't know. I'm trying to help you.

10:58.329 --> 11:00.126
So then I asked her
if she wanted a drink.

11:00.289 --> 11:03.201
- You don't drink.
- I couldn't think of anything else to say.

11:03.369 --> 11:07.123
- So you started drinking.
- So we started drinking, and...

11:07.289 --> 11:09.484
I don't know if it was the alcohol
or the ammonia...

11:09.649 --> 11:12.561
...but the next thing I knew,
she was mopping the floor with me.

11:15.609 --> 11:17.884
- And how was it?
- The sex was okay...

11:18.049 --> 11:20.483
...but I threw up
from the Hennigan's.

11:22.569 --> 11:24.844
Good thing the cleaning lady
was there.

11:29.769 --> 11:30.997
Dick was fired.

11:31.169 --> 11:34.684
You mean to tell me, I put that drink
six inches over to the right...

11:34.849 --> 11:37.682
...and this wouldn't have happened?
- You knew he was an alcoholic.

11:37.849 --> 11:40.079
- Why'd you put the drink down?
- What are you saying?

11:40.569 --> 11:42.241
- I'm not saying anything.
- Yes, you are.

11:42.409 --> 11:44.718
- What could I be saying?
- You must be saying something.

11:44.889 --> 11:46.641
If I was, I would have said it.

11:46.809 --> 11:48.003
- Say it.
- I said it.

11:48.169 --> 11:49.841
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

11:51.729 --> 11:54.197
It's exhausting being with you.

11:56.009 --> 11:57.158
- Yeah.
- It's George.

11:57.329 --> 11:59.445
- Come on up.
- Hey.

12:00.009 --> 12:01.283
Let me ask you something.

12:01.449 --> 12:04.361
Did George buy that sweater
knowing the red dot was on it...

12:04.529 --> 12:06.406
...because it was cheaper?

12:07.049 --> 12:10.883
- Okay. You just gave me the answer.
- No, I didn't.

12:11.569 --> 12:14.322
Yes, you did. Yes, you did.
I saw your expression.

12:14.489 --> 12:17.765
I didn't have an expression.
I have a deviated septum.

12:17.929 --> 12:19.647
I have to...

12:20.129 --> 12:22.040
I have to open my mouth
sometimes to breathe.

12:23.089 --> 12:24.920
How much did he save?

12:25.609 --> 12:30.888
Frankly, I am shocked that you
could ask such a question of me.

12:31.049 --> 12:34.325
If l... The only surprise was how
you could even think of that.

12:34.489 --> 12:37.128
That's what you were seeing.

12:39.689 --> 12:41.361
I have to talk to you.

12:41.529 --> 12:43.759
This cleaning woman's
turning the screws on me.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.965
She's pushing for this
whole relationship thing.

12:46.129 --> 12:48.768
She keeps calling me.
She's threatening to go to the boss.

12:48.929 --> 12:51.204
I could lose my job.
I gotta keep her quiet.

12:51.409 --> 12:53.923
Elaine's in the bathroom.
She's wise to the red-dot thing.

12:54.089 --> 12:56.728
She's asking me
all kinds of questions about it.

12:58.889 --> 13:00.561
- Did you tell her anything?
- No.

13:00.729 --> 13:03.004
- You swear?
- I'm not swearing. I don't wanna swear.

13:03.169 --> 13:04.363
- Come on, swear.
- No.

13:04.529 --> 13:06.565
- Oh, you told her, didn't you?
- No.

13:06.729 --> 13:10.881
Hey, George, did you buy that sweater
knowing the red dot was on it...

13:11.049 --> 13:13.438
...because you could get it
at a discount?

13:13.609 --> 13:15.247
What?

13:15.849 --> 13:18.044
- Did I what?
- You did, didn't you?

13:18.649 --> 13:21.686
Elaine, I'm shocked.
I'm shocked.

13:21.849 --> 13:26.206
Here I go out, in the spirit of the
season and spend all my savings...

13:26.369 --> 13:29.839
...to buy you the most beautiful
Christmas sweater I have ever seen...

13:30.009 --> 13:32.569
...to show my appreciation to you
at Christmas...

13:32.729 --> 13:35.368
...and this is the thanks I get
at Christmas.

13:37.489 --> 13:39.798
- Well, Jerry told me that you did.
- You told her?

13:39.969 --> 13:42.483
How could you tell her?
What kind of friend are you?

13:42.649 --> 13:46.119
I didn't tell her, you stupid idiot.
She tricked you.

13:50.249 --> 13:52.638
Elaine, you don't understand.

13:53.129 --> 13:56.644
I had a 103 temperature
when I bought that sweater.

13:56.889 --> 13:59.528
I was so dizzy, I was seeing
red dots everywhere.

13:59.929 --> 14:02.238
I thought everything in the store
had a red dot on it.

14:02.409 --> 14:05.685
I couldn't distinguish one red dot
from the other.

14:06.249 --> 14:07.762
I couldn't afford anything.

14:07.929 --> 14:11.604
I have nothing. I haven't worked
for a really long time.

14:11.769 --> 14:14.078
I mean, look, I have no clothes.

14:14.249 --> 14:15.682
Look at what I'm wearing.

14:15.849 --> 14:17.726
It was just a little red dot.

14:17.889 --> 14:20.039
A little red dot.

14:24.329 --> 14:28.800
- This is for you.
- Oh, Georgie, you bought this for me?

14:29.249 --> 14:31.046
Oh, I knew you cared for me.

14:31.209 --> 14:34.087
As you care for me,
which is why it's very important...

14:34.249 --> 14:37.207
...that you never breathe a word
to anyone about...

14:37.369 --> 14:40.964
You know? What with
Clarence Thomas and everything.

14:41.929 --> 14:44.238
- Okay. Can I open it now?
- Yes, of course. Go ahead.

14:44.409 --> 14:47.207
My guess is you're gonna
like this very much.

14:50.569 --> 14:53.606
- Is that cashmere?
- Of course it's cashmere.

14:53.769 --> 14:56.363
Oh, a cashmere sweater.

14:56.529 --> 14:58.406
Oh, Georgie Porgie.

14:58.569 --> 15:00.560
Just a little something for Christmas.

15:02.249 --> 15:07.960
When I was a little girl in Panama,
a rich American came to our town.

15:08.129 --> 15:11.644
And he was wearing the softest,
most beautiful sweater.

15:11.809 --> 15:15.518
I said, "What do you call
this beautiful fabric?"

15:16.169 --> 15:17.648
And he said:

15:17.809 --> 15:20.642
"They call it cashmere."

15:22.009 --> 15:26.878
I repeated the word.
"Cashmere, cashmere"...

15:27.049 --> 15:29.119
...and I asked him if I could have it...

15:29.489 --> 15:30.968
...and he said:

15:31.129 --> 15:33.359
"No. Get away from me."

15:33.529 --> 15:36.805
And he started to walk away.

15:36.969 --> 15:39.039
Oh, but I grabbed onto his leg...

15:39.209 --> 15:41.120
...screaming for him
to give me the sweater...

15:41.289 --> 15:43.359
...and he dragged me
through the streets.

15:43.529 --> 15:45.679
And then he kicked me
with the other foot...

15:45.849 --> 15:48.158
...and he threw some change at me.

15:48.329 --> 15:51.480
But I didn't want the change, Georgie.

15:52.409 --> 15:56.038
I wanted the cashmere.

15:59.009 --> 16:01.239
I had a feeling you would like it.

16:01.409 --> 16:04.128
- I'm going to try it on.
- No. Don't try it on now. Try it later.

16:04.289 --> 16:07.201
Oh, look, it fits beautiful.

16:07.369 --> 16:10.167
All right, take it off.
You're gonna ruin it.

16:10.729 --> 16:12.481
What's this?

16:14.409 --> 16:16.047
I was in a men's room the other day.

16:16.209 --> 16:20.088
They had the hand blower instead of
the paper towels. You know this thing?

16:20.249 --> 16:21.967
I like the hand blower, I have to say.

16:22.129 --> 16:25.519
Takes a little bit longer,
but I feel when you're in a room...

16:25.689 --> 16:29.204
...with a revolting stench, you want
to spend as much time as you can.

16:30.689 --> 16:33.123
The only stench is coming from you.

16:33.289 --> 16:34.608
Oh, well, wait a second.

16:34.769 --> 16:37.567
I believe we have a heckler,
ladies and gentlemen.

16:37.729 --> 16:39.367
Dick, I don't know
what your problem is.

16:39.529 --> 16:41.520
It's not my fault
you're back on the wagon.

16:41.689 --> 16:43.645
It's "off the wagon."

16:43.809 --> 16:47.245
In the old days, how do you think they
got the alcohol from town to town?

16:49.769 --> 16:51.600
- I don't know.
- On a wagon.

16:52.169 --> 16:56.128
Don't you think they broke into a
couple of those bottles along the way?

16:56.289 --> 16:58.644
You can't drink on a wagon.
It's too bumpy.

16:58.809 --> 17:01.243
They had smooth trails.
What about the Cumberland Gap?

17:01.409 --> 17:03.445
What the hell do you know
about wagons?

17:03.609 --> 17:06.077
I know enough not to get on them.

17:08.769 --> 17:11.203
I'm gonna get right to the point.

17:11.529 --> 17:14.362
It's come to my attention
that you and the cleaning woman...

17:14.529 --> 17:18.238
...have engaged in sexual intercourse
on the desk in your office.

17:19.529 --> 17:20.723
Is that correct?

17:24.888 --> 17:26.959
- Who said that?
- She did.

17:28.489 --> 17:30.081
Was that wrong?

17:30.849 --> 17:32.885
Should I not have done that?

17:33.049 --> 17:34.880
I gotta plead ignorance
on this thing...

17:35.049 --> 17:37.244
...because if anyone
had said anything to me...

17:37.409 --> 17:41.288
...when I started here that that
sort of thing was frowned upon...

17:42.169 --> 17:44.399
You know, because I've worked
in a lot of offices...

17:44.569 --> 17:47.845
...and I tell you,
people do that all the time.

17:48.969 --> 17:50.766
You're fired.

17:51.489 --> 17:53.684
Well, you didn't have
to say it like that.

17:53.849 --> 17:56.079
I want you out of here
by the end of the day.

18:07.049 --> 18:09.882
What about the whole Christmas-spirit
thing? Any flexibility there?

18:10.049 --> 18:11.562
No.

18:13.409 --> 18:15.161
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

18:16.689 --> 18:19.123
She wanted me to give you this.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.885
You had sex on your desk
with the cleaning woman.

18:33.769 --> 18:35.487
You never had sex
in the office before?

18:35.849 --> 18:38.568
No. I once made out with someone,
but that's it.

18:38.729 --> 18:40.720
Okay. All right. So you made out.

18:40.889 --> 18:43.119
- Well, that's not sex.
- Kissing is sex.

18:43.489 --> 18:45.366
Kissing is not sex.

18:45.529 --> 18:47.679
- George.
- Jerry.

18:47.849 --> 18:51.922
Hey, did Jerry leave that drink
next to Dick's on purpose?

18:52.329 --> 18:54.001
- No.
- George?

18:54.169 --> 18:55.602
Over here.

18:57.249 --> 18:58.477
What are you doing here?

18:58.649 --> 19:01.004
I'm taking the kid out to dinner
to cheer him up.

19:01.169 --> 19:04.127
Hey, Jerry, when do you consider sex
has taken place?

19:05.249 --> 19:07.046
I would say...

19:07.209 --> 19:09.279
...when the nipple
makes its first appearance.

19:15.169 --> 19:20.641
So George told me that you left
the drink next to Dick's on purpose.

19:21.609 --> 19:23.281
Nice try.

19:26.489 --> 19:30.038
So guess who heckled me
at the club last night.

19:31.609 --> 19:34.328
Merry Christmas!

19:34.489 --> 19:36.605
- Oh, my God, that's Dick.
- Dick?

19:36.769 --> 19:38.122
Dick!

19:39.609 --> 19:41.918
It's Cape Fear.

19:42.689 --> 19:44.600
Hide. Hide under the desk.

19:46.769 --> 19:48.122
- Move over.
- Get off of me.

19:48.289 --> 19:51.008
- I have no room.
- My foot's sticking out.

19:51.169 --> 19:53.205
Shut up. He's coming.

20:09.849 --> 20:11.202
Is that cashmere?

20:12.329 --> 20:13.842
Of course it's cashmere.

20:17.929 --> 20:19.123
What's this?

20:23.369 --> 20:26.725
But, in a way, I think I inadvertently
turned this guy into an alcoholic.

20:26.889 --> 20:28.447
I hate being around alcoholics.

20:28.609 --> 20:31.999
They're either saying how much they
love you or how much they hate you.

20:32.769 --> 20:34.805
Those are the two statements
that scare me most.

20:34.969 --> 20:37.961
But I think he's okay now because
I don't know how he feels about me.

20:38.129 --> 20:41.201
- He's finally off the wagon.
- You mean on the wagon.

20:41.369 --> 20:42.563
Don't get smart.
