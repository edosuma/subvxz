and I am the fastest man alive.

00:07.466 --> 00:10.173
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

00:10.428 --> 00:13.090
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at 8. TA R. Labs,

00:13.306 --> 00:16.264
I ﬁght crime
and ﬁnd other meta-humans like me.

00:16.809 --> 00:18.674
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

00:18.936 --> 00:21.769
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

00:21.981 --> 00:25.348
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

00:39.290 --> 00:40.450
I came here to help you, Bany.

00:40.666 --> 00:42.702
He may not be
Harrison Wells from your Earth.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.825
He has just as many secrets
as the one you knew.

00:45.046 --> 00:47.628
I get these feelings sometimes.
These vibes.

00:47.840 --> 00:51.048
I'm not sure what triggers it.
And sometimes it just happens.

BARRY: I've been running a lot lately,

01:08.152 --> 01:10.188
trying to go faster than
I've ever gone before,

01:10.404 --> 01:12.690
because there's someone out there
who's better,

01:12.907 --> 01:15.819
faster and stronger than I am.

01:16.035 --> 01:17.900
And I need to be ready.

01:18.162 --> 01:21.871
But no matter how much I try,
or how hard I push myself

01:22.083 --> 01:24.369
I keep running into the same problem.

01:26.504 --> 01:28.369
He just hit 1,375.

01:29.882 --> 01:31.418
What's the fastest Bany's run?

01:32.093 --> 01:34.254
Little over Mach 2,
when he ran back in time.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.219
That's not good.

01:37.431 --> 01:38.716
That's good, Bany.

01:41.102 --> 01:42.387
We have our work cut out for us.

01:43.896 --> 01:45.432
I'm not getting faster, am I?

01:45.773 --> 01:47.684
-Well—
-No. You're not.

01:48.276 --> 01:50.232
All right. Well, let's ﬁx this, right?

01:50.444 --> 01:51.729
I mean, I can't beat Zoom at this speed.

01:51.946 --> 01:53.527
It felt like I was standing still
next to him.

01:53.698 --> 01:54.778
Oh, that's because you practically were.

01:55.032 --> 01:58.115
Zoom is at least three,
four times faster than you at this point.

01:58.286 --> 02:00.618
How is he so much faster than Bany is,
and Jay was?

02:00.871 --> 02:03.283
Physiology. form, strength.

02:03.541 --> 02:07.033
Could be a number of things.
Attitude, diet...

02:07.211 --> 02:09.042
Okay. Well, there's gotta be
something we can do about it.

02:09.255 --> 02:13.089

So how are we gonna help Bany?

Didn't say.

03:02.558 --> 03:06.096
Thirty-two. And I will polish them all
in blood before long.

03:06.312 --> 03:09.645
I've waited a long time for this hunt.

03:09.857 --> 03:13.190
and you have brought me
very close to my prey.

03:13.527 --> 03:17.691
Mister, you're not gonna do
any hunting in those handcuffs.

04:21.095 --> 04:22.676
Done by one person.

04:22.972 --> 04:24.087
One person did all this?

04:24.515 --> 04:25.971
Oh, yeah. You can see
from the blood pattern.

04:26.183 --> 04:29.266
This guy was shot ﬁrst,
then the Police Chief,

04:29.478 --> 04:33.096
then these three were stabbed.
before ﬁnishing off the Captain.

04:33.315 --> 04:34.896
Wowl Do you think a meta-human did it?

04:35.651 --> 04:38.859
I don't know, but I found this
in all of the stab victims' wounds.

04:39.071 --> 04:40.777
It's some type of cryptocrystalline.

04:40.990 --> 04:44.278
Flint, most likely. Probably broke off
the blade during the ﬁght.

04:44.493 --> 04:45.653
I'll run it to make sure.

04:45.870 --> 04:48.156
Let's see what stores
sell those kind of ﬂint knives.

04:48.372 --> 04:52.160

-Okay.
-Okay.

not to be affectionate in front of me.

05:31.457 --> 05:34.039
I couldn't decide
which restaurant to go to,

05:34.251 --> 05:37.038
so I thought we would create our own.

these blades are old. Centuries old.

would be after you?

No. I've never seen him before in my life.

07:52.681 --> 07:54.217
Well, he was certainly
acting like he knew you.

07:54.433 --> 07:56.594
He kept calling her Priestess Chay-Ara.

-You mean Egyptian?
-That's right.

let us try to protect you.

You didn't see this guy, Joe.

a cop is gonna be able to protect her.

No, but we do have a few friends
who can lend a hand.

to leave Central City.

a lot worse than "knife-throwing."

I don't think this guy's a meta-human.

08:33.806 --> 08:38.391
There's something different about him.
Something mystical.

08:38.644 --> 08:39.724
Mystical, really?

08:39.937 --> 08:42.053
We stop meta-humans
because we're scientists.

08:42.272 --> 08:43.603
We can ﬁgure out
what their weaknesses are.

-Do you have any other surprises for me?
-(CHUCKLES)

12:29.917 --> 12:31.532
Please. No more surprises.

12:32.544 --> 12:34.000
Bany said that you need our help.

12:34.212 --> 12:35.873
Somebody very dangerous is after you.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.466
Yeah, and I have no idea why.

12:38.926 --> 12:40.336
What's does this guy even look like?

12:40.761 --> 12:41.841
Uh... Hold on.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.720
(CLEARS THROAT) Okay. This is him.

12:49.937 --> 12:51.427
Yeah. See, that's something
I would never think of.

12:52.147 --> 12:54.263
Hmm, kinda rockin'
that Dothraki look. Hot.

12:54.483 --> 12:56.769
Let's see if facial recognition
can ﬁnd a match.

12:58.654 --> 12:59.939
{EEEEREI

13:03.241 --> 13:04.321
"mm

13:04.618 --> 13:07.485
Yeah, strange.
This picture's from 1975.

13:07.704 --> 13:09.319
Which would make him about
80 years old right now.

13:09.539 --> 13:11.040
Okay, what else can you tell us?

13:12.292 --> 13:15.625
He said we've known each other for ages,
but I've never met the man before.

13:15.837 --> 13:17.498
But there has to be
some kind of a connection.

13:17.881 --> 13:19.417
Not one I can think of.

13:19.633 --> 13:21.715
I just moved to Central City,
six months ago.

13:21.927 --> 13:23.417
Why'd you move there?

13:23.637 --> 13:26.128
I just felt drawn to the city, I guess.

13:26.348 --> 13:28.885
Kendra. there is a reason
this guy's after you. Think.

13:29.101 --> 13:31.808
Look, man. we just came out here
to hide out for a bit

13:32.020 --> 13:34.511
until we ﬁgure things out, so you can
just take it down just a little.

13:34.731 --> 13:37.313
You came here because you need our help.
This is what my help looks like.

13:37.526 --> 13:38.811
Oliver, I just saved you guys

13:39.027 --> 13:41.109
from whatever the hell Flock of Seagulls
was about to do.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.401
The Ieast you can do is just—

13:42.614 --> 13:44.229
Bany, none of us have superpowers.

13:44.449 --> 13:46.610
You brought Kendra into our world
without knowing who she is

13:46.910 --> 13:49.071
or what this dude
that is after her is looking for.

13:49.287 --> 13:52.620
You made all of us unsafe.
So maybe you ask the questions.

13:52.791 --> 13:53.826
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:55.877 --> 13:58.368
-We're all friends here, right?
-Mmm-hmm.

13:58.714 --> 14:00.420
Why don't we go back to our place
and have some drinks,

14:02.801 --> 14:04.132
Cool.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.550
What you working on?

14:09.307 --> 14:12.140
a speedster's velocity
that I've been developing

14:12.352 --> 14:14.559
since Zoom showed up on my Earth.

14:14.771 --> 14:17.888
Ironically, this was meant
to help out Jay Garrick.

14:18.108 --> 14:20.224
You want to give Bany a drug
to make him run faster?

14:20.444 --> 14:23.026
Temporarily enhance the Speed Force
in his system. yes.

14:23.238 --> 14:25.445
So you're trying to make
nitrous oxide for speedsters.

14:25.657 --> 14:26.737
Good analogy. Yes. I tried.

14:26.950 --> 14:28.565
Five times I've tried,
ﬁve times I've failed.

14:28.785 --> 14:32.573
That's what you get when your background
is technology and not biochemistry.

14:32.789 --> 14:35.166
-Well, then you are lucky I am here.
-What does that mean?

14:35.417 --> 14:36.953
You've been thinking of this
as a mechanical problem,

14:38.670 --> 14:39.750
rmnmmmmmm

14:40.005 --> 14:43.839
When a speedster runs. they consume
an extraordinary amount of oxygen.

14:44.092 --> 14:46.925
So we just need something to give
an extra boost of oxygen during that time.

14:47.137 --> 14:49.128
-Like an oxygen generator.
-Exactlyl

14:49.765 --> 14:51.926
So we just need
a chemical that's rich in oxygen,

14:52.184 --> 14:56.223
that would release it as a nearly pure gas
as it decomposes.

14:56.646 --> 14:58.853
-Something like sodium chlorate.
-Sodium chlorate.

14:59.066 --> 15:01.557
Then, all we need is heat
to release the oxygen.

15:01.777 --> 15:05.110
Which a speedster generates naturally
in the form of lightning.

15:06.323 --> 15:08.154
I think something like this
just might work.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.568
You think you can help me ﬁgure it out?

15:09.785 --> 15:10.991
I can certainly try.

15:13.330 --> 15:15.787
I'm not changing my nickname.
I like Speedy.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.364
CISCO: Are you familiar
with my body of work?

15:17.584 --> 15:19.449
If you are, then you know I can come up

15:19.669 --> 15:21.705
with something so much
better than "Speedy."

15:22.339 --> 15:26.082
Why don't you get a haircut,
and then maybe we can talk about it.

15:26.301 --> 15:29.008
I think you just mad 'cause
my conditioner game is on point.

15:29.513 --> 15:33.927
So, the CEO of Palmer Technologies
is living with Oliver Queen.

15:34.142 --> 15:36.349
It's insane how much
life can change in six months, huh?

15:36.561 --> 15:39.974
Which you would know better than anyone,
considering that there's another Flash,

15:40.190 --> 15:43.478
-another Dr. Wells, from another Earth?
-Mmm-hmm.

15:43.693 --> 15:46.309
-I mean...
-Yeah. I know. It's been trippy lately.

15:47.030 --> 15:51.273
I wonder what Oliver's doppelganger
would look like. Bald. Pot-bellied.

15:52.035 --> 15:53.366
-Uh-huh.
-Agreeable.

15:58.083 --> 15:59.948
-I am, actually.
-Good.

16:00.168 --> 16:03.331

that I laid all of this on you.

16:14.850 --> 16:16.556

-(SIGHS) That's okay.

-(CHUCKLES)

16:21.731 --> 16:23.813
No, but I'm glad that you're here.
I'm glad you reached out.

16:24.025 --> 16:27.392
It shows a real maturity. And I would know
that because I've never been that mature.

16:27.571 --> 16:28.731
(LAUGHS)

16:29.239 --> 16:30.274
I'm always here for you.

16:30.949 --> 16:32.109
Thank you.

16:32.325 --> 16:35.192
I gotta say, I mean, this isn't the same
Arrow team I'm used to seeing.

16:35.412 --> 16:38.245
Or the same Oliver Queen.
You seem really...

16:38.540 --> 16:40.246
-Happy?
-Happy. Yeah.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.162
I am happy. I ﬁnally have everything
that I've ever wanted.

16:43.378 --> 16:47.792
Being with Felicity has given me
a real sense of peace.

16:48.008 --> 16:49.589
It's something that I haven't had
in a long time.

16:49.843 --> 16:52.630
Didn't you tell me that guys like us
don't get the girl?

16:52.888 --> 16:55.004
Yep. I was wrong.

16:56.057 --> 16:57.137
(LAUGHS)

16:57.559 --> 16:59.550
I would like to propose a toast.

17:00.312 --> 17:03.645
I wish it wasn't just the dark times
bringing us together.

17:05.650 --> 17:09.518
But it is friends like you
that make those dark times worth having.

17:09.946 --> 17:12.232
(CHUCKLES) What a guy!
Steals my drink, steals my words.

17:12.449 --> 17:14.360

it's good to see everyone.

We're gonna keep her safe. I promise.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.957
Yeah. I know.
Look, there's something I never told you.

17:28.757 --> 17:31.965
The ﬁrst time I kissed Kendra.
I got a vibe.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.841
NO, not like that kind Of vibe.

about this sooner?

17:47.692 --> 17:50.308
Well, I didn't think it was related,
but I guess, now, it has to be.

17:51.821 --> 17:54.233
Look, I don't, I don't want her
to know about my powers.

17:56.117 --> 17:58.324

and she loves movies, and...

18:05.377 --> 18:07.117
I just...
I've never felt like this before,

18:07.337 --> 18:08.952

All right. Lance is gonna call if he gets
any information on whoever that is.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.195
I know where we can get some info.

20:07.957 --> 20:11.449
Kendra. I have powers.

20:13.338 --> 20:17.081
I get these vibes from people,
they're visions of meta-humans.

20:19.135 --> 20:20.420
And I had one of you.

20:20.887 --> 20:25.802
So, A. you're saying you're a meta-human,
and B. she's a meta-human?

This is what was so urgent, Harrison?

21:24.200 --> 21:26.691
You get me to come here
so I can take your speed drug?

21:27.203 --> 21:29.194
-That's right.
-You knew about this?

21:29.456 --> 21:31.868
-Of course she did. She ﬁgured it out.
-Uh...

21:32.876 --> 21:34.207
I thought this was to help Bany.

21:34.836 --> 21:37.327
It is to help Bany. Which is why we need
to do test runs on subjects

21:37.547 --> 21:39.708
who once had the Speed Force
in their system.

21:40.049 --> 21:41.505
Speed Force doesn't work like that.

21:41.718 --> 21:44.050
It's not something
you can create in a lab.

21:44.304 --> 21:46.044
How do you think you became
the Flash, Garrick?

21:46.222 --> 21:50.841
By me and a lab. Science is what
did this to you, to Bany, to Zoom.

21:51.060 --> 21:53.972
And science is what we need to stop Zoom,
and this is our only option.

can't be replicated or enhanced.

we shouldn't give it to Bany.

Others say he guided Julius Caesar
through the Gallic Wars.

But one thing the League knows for sure,
he was there for all of it.

22:37.148 --> 22:39.730

He's like a vampire or something?

22:39.943 --> 22:42.104
Not a vampire. An Immortal.

into crazy town. Immortality?

as he did in 1975.

24:40.313 --> 24:41.348

-l'm on it!

24:41.564 --> 24:43.179
Whoa, whoa, whoa! This is my house.

24:43.441 --> 24:44.931
Don't wony. We're gonna ﬁnd her.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.563

24:54.202 --> 24:56.067
Wow.
You look as beautiful as ever.

24:57.997 --> 25:00.784
Chay-Ara. it's me. Khufu.

25:10.051 --> 25:12.417
Do you remember? Look at me.

25:13.930 --> 25:15.136
You need to wake up.

25:15.348 --> 25:16.884
What are you talking about?

25:17.433 --> 25:18.764
I don't know who you are.

25:18.976 --> 25:20.477
You will once you emerge.

25:20.687 --> 25:23.394
Until then, you need to stay by my side
so that I can protect you.

25:23.648 --> 25:25.263

25:25.483 --> 25:27.940

25:32.281 --> 25:34.112

watching you work, Smoak.

-Mmml

25:35.785 --> 25:36.865

-That was pitiful.

25:37.078 --> 25:38.284
I know this is a lot to take in,

25:38.496 --> 25:40.407
but you sort of just
kinda have to trust me on this.

25:40.665 --> 25:45.750
I... (EXHALES) Just one second.
Stay right there.

25:53.636 --> 25:55.342

27:43.246 --> 27:44.782

27:50.586 --> 27:52.326
We can't use that serum on Bany.

27:53.256 --> 27:54.587
That's up to him, isn't it?

27:55.216 --> 27:59.255
If Bany wants to stop Zoom,
this is what he needs.

27:59.595 --> 28:00.630
Jay said it could hurt Bany.

28:00.847 --> 28:01.927
Well, Jay's a coward.

28:02.181 --> 28:04.797
Jay's a scientist
who knows a lot about speedsters.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.052
You're a scientist. Snow.

28:06.227 --> 28:09.310
You've been watching Bany, you know
he's nowhere near fast as he needs to be.

28:09.522 --> 28:11.763
This other mentor,
this other Harrison Wells,

28:11.983 --> 28:14.395
did not want him to reach
his full potential. I do.

28:14.610 --> 28:16.521
You know, you're really starting
to sound a lot like him.

28:20.616 --> 28:21.731

Dr. McGee was right. She did see you.

-Christina McGee?
-At Mercury Labs. You're Harrison Wells.

28:33.087 --> 28:34.827
Yes, I'm Harrison Wells.
I'm not the Harrison Wells—

28:35.047 --> 28:36.298

Stay with me. Harrison Wells. Come on.

29:02.325 --> 29:03.360
Why did you shoot him?

29:03.534 --> 29:05.274
I thought that was a gun.
I'm sony. I'll call 911.

29:05.494 --> 29:06.574
-Nol Don'tl
-Why?

29:06.787 --> 29:08.778
Because this—
Didn't Joe West explain this to you?

29:08.998 --> 29:10.454
-No.
-Just call Joel

29:10.666 --> 29:11.746
Okay.

-What's your name?
-You're putting her in danger

29:30.186 --> 29:31.892
and I'm the only one
capable of saving her.

29:32.104 --> 29:35.437
A very interesting perspective
on what the word "saving" means.

29:35.733 --> 29:37.143
She's the love of my lifetimes,
sweetheart.

29:37.360 --> 29:39.316
I was not gonna hurt her.

But that is not who we are.

29:55.461 --> 29:57.042
I'll m m mmmm

29:57.338 --> 29:59.829
You're Priestess Chay-Ara.
I'm Prince Khufu.

30:00.049 --> 30:02.665
And we're lovers. soul mates.

30:02.885 --> 30:05.251
We've been partners
for 4,000 years.

30:05.471 --> 30:07.177
We're drawn to each other in each life.
and after we die,

30:07.348 --> 30:10.340
we reincamate to ﬁnd each other again,
and again, and again.

30:10.559 --> 30:12.936
And now that I've found you,
we should really get out of here.

30:13.145 --> 30:15.181
Okay, Romeo.
why don't you pump the brakes?

30:15.815 --> 30:18.522
These people cannot protect you
from Savage any longer.

30:18.734 --> 30:20.395
Do you know who Vandal Savage is?

30:22.113 --> 30:25.651
In every lifetime.
he hunts us down and kills us.

30:28.202 --> 30:29.863
And I'm not planning to make it 207.

30:30.079 --> 30:31.569
Why does he kill you?

30:31.956 --> 30:33.571
:mnammm

30:35.167 --> 30:37.579
Every time he kills us.
he becomes more powerful. You do the math.

30:37.795 --> 30:39.205
You're 0 for 206,

30:39.422 --> 30:41.708
and you still think
you're her best bet, hmm?

30:41.924 --> 30:45.087
Okay, so what we need to do
is just ﬁnd Savage and get rid of him.

30:46.137 --> 30:48.594
(SCOFFS) Well,
you can't get rid of him, my friend.

30:51.434 --> 30:53.220
It might be harder than you think.

30:53.436 --> 30:55.893
(STUTTERS) Is that the only way
this guy knows how to enter a room?

30:56.605 --> 30:59.142
My associates tell me
Savage left Star City a few hours ago.

30:59.358 --> 31:00.393
mmm

31:00.568 --> 31:02.684
We're not quite sure. But I assume
after his run in with you,

31:02.903 --> 31:05.770
he realized he needed something
more powerful to complete his mission.

31:06.032 --> 31:07.192
(SCOFFS) Well...

31:07.533 --> 31:09.524
We think he's trying to locate
the Staff of Horus.

31:09.994 --> 31:11.575
Sony, what is that?

31:11.787 --> 31:15.200
It's a relic from our past.
An ancient and powerful weapon.

31:17.043 --> 31:20.627
If Savage gets his hands on it, it's gonna
be nearly impossible to stop him.

31:20.921 --> 31:23.708
Since when did our lives suddenly become
an Indiana Jones movie?

31:24.633 --> 31:26.009
-Felicity? Think you can ﬁnd it?
-Yeah.

31:26.218 --> 31:27.674
Yes. It's probably at some
museum somewhere.

31:27.887 --> 31:30.594
I'll work my magic.
See what I can ﬁnd.

31:31.724 --> 31:33.931
We're running out of time.

31:34.143 --> 31:37.931
You need to emerge. now. Come on.

31:38.147 --> 31:40.263
What is it going to take for you
to believe me? You saw my wings.

31:40.983 --> 31:42.484
I know you know this is true.

31:43.277 --> 31:45.063
Please. just let me show you how.

31:49.950 --> 31:51.360
-HoW's he doing?
-He's losing oxygen.

31:54.538 --> 31:56.244
-I need you to leave.
-Joe, I—

31:56.457 --> 31:57.663
Patty. go.

31:58.918 --> 32:00.624
There's a bullet in a branch
of his pulmonary artery

32:00.836 --> 32:03.418
that's blocking off most of the blood ﬂow
from the left lung.

32:03.672 --> 32:04.798
Are we able to get the bullet out?

32:05.007 --> 32:06.668
Not without causing too much damage.

32:06.884 --> 32:08.249
I need Jay's help.

32:20.022 --> 32:21.603
So,

32:23.025 --> 32:25.516
you just want me to jump?

32:26.112 --> 32:29.821
Fall, jump, swan dive.
whatever suits you. Just, do it.

32:30.199 --> 32:31.860
Okay. This isn't the X Games.

32:32.076 --> 32:33.907
OLNER: And this is how she emerges?

32:34.120 --> 32:37.328
She just falls towards her death?

32:37.665 --> 32:40.122
Yep. 4,000 years of experience
says that's exactly how.

32:41.710 --> 32:44.668
No, I'm sony. What are we doing?
Why are we listening to this guy?

32:44.880 --> 32:47.838
Come on. Oliver. You're supposed to be
the one who asks questions.

32:48.050 --> 32:51.213
Okay, but after what we saw,
after what Cisco said,

32:51.428 --> 32:53.043
I cannot believe I'm gonna say this,

32:59.979 --> 33:01.640
Hey, hey, hey.

33:06.402 --> 33:07.517

33:20.124 --> 33:23.241
Saving her life. You should have emerged.
Something is blocking you.

33:23.586 --> 33:24.951
Well, we should just try again
and see—

33:25.171 --> 33:26.627
-Nol
-Yeah, no! No, no, no.

33:26.797 --> 33:29.004
No. We're not doing that again.
Kendra. you don't have to do this.

33:29.175 --> 33:31.666
Oliver, we can stop Savage. okay?

33:31.844 --> 33:33.505
-Barryl
-What?

33:36.015 --> 33:37.551
Can I talk to you for a second?

33:38.809 --> 33:39.889
Okay.

33:40.102 --> 33:41.387
Keep an eye on him.

33:44.773 --> 33:45.979
What is going on with you?

33:46.192 --> 33:47.227
I'm trying to keep her alive.

33:47.443 --> 33:49.559
-Then I think we let herjump.
-Are you kidding?

33:49.778 --> 33:52.565
Bany, I get that you're desperate to help
and you want to be the hero,

33:52.781 --> 33:54.066
and you wanna save her yourself.

33:54.283 --> 33:56.148
But I think she has to have
a part in it, too.

33:56.994 --> 33:58.029
(SCOFFS)

33:59.538 --> 34:01.278
-What?
-It's just the rules keep changing.

34:01.498 --> 34:02.908
One day, I have to run through time,

34:03.125 --> 34:04.990
the next,
I'm ﬁghting a telepathic gorilla.

34:05.211 --> 34:06.542
(STUTTERING) And now, we're what?

34:06.754 --> 34:08.619
We're. we're chasing down
an immortal madman

34:08.839 --> 34:11.706
on a rampage against
a reincarnated warrior Priestess?

34:11.884 --> 34:13.124
(BOTH SIGH)

34:14.720 --> 34:16.256
I just never thought I'd have superpowers

34:16.472 --> 34:18.713
and feel more powerless
than I ever have in my entire life.

34:18.933 --> 34:22.517
That part, I understand.
But you have already helped Kendra.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.514
You have kept her alive.

34:25.022 --> 34:26.228
So now, let's help her get her wings,

34:26.440 --> 34:28.806
and then she can give you
a lift back to Central City.

34:31.612 --> 34:35.196
-Central City.
-What?

34:36.200 --> 34:37.940
We need to check Central City
for the staff.

34:38.160 --> 34:40.116
-Kendra. you said you were drawn there?
-Yeah.

34:40.329 --> 34:41.785
I think you're drawn to things
that destroy you,

34:41.997 --> 34:43.453
the same way the two of you
are drawn to each other.

34:43.666 --> 34:45.657
That's why it wasn't in any museum
or private collection,

34:45.876 --> 34:48.583
because it was consecrated eight months
ago at St. Mark's in Central City.

34:48.796 --> 34:50.332
We've gotta get it before Savage does.

34:50.631 --> 34:52.496
Carter, stay here.

34:52.758 --> 34:53.838
I'm not going anywhere.

34:54.009 --> 34:57.046
Call Thea and Dig and we'll have them hold
down the fort in case Savage shows up.

34:57.221 --> 34:59.553
Kendra. last year, I lost my powers.

34:59.807 --> 35:00.967
The only way I could get them back is

35:01.183 --> 35:03.265
if I just forgot about everything
happening around me.

35:03.477 --> 35:05.388
and focused on who I was.

35:05.729 --> 35:08.641
Just believe in yourself,
and your true self will emerge.

35:09.149 --> 35:10.355

35:10.651 --> 35:12.892
Hey. Are you sure that
you want to do this?

35:13.654 --> 35:17.192

35:50.316 --> 35:52.056

35:53.485 --> 35:55.396
-Can you close the wound if I get it?
-Yes.

35:55.612 --> 35:57.068
How are you gonna do that?

35:59.616 --> 36:02.107
-What is that?
-It's a serum, called Velocity-Six.

36:02.328 --> 36:03.693
It could give Jay temporary speed.

36:03.912 --> 36:06.119
He can phase through Dr. Wells' chest,
and remove the bullet.

36:06.290 --> 36:08.656
Yeah. But I told you, I've no idea
what's gonna happen if I use that.

36:08.876 --> 36:09.956
It's our only option.

36:10.169 --> 36:12.080
If you don't do this,
Dr. Wells will die.

Thank you.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.245
I was just thinking,

36:53.212 --> 36:56.295
all the moments in my life
when I felt different.

36:57.383 --> 36:58.748
like something was wrong with me.

37:01.428 --> 37:02.463
now I know why.

37:04.473 --> 37:08.011
It's gonna be all right, okay?

37:09.353 --> 37:13.972
Look, I know what it's like to have
your life suddenly change like this.

37:14.858 --> 37:17.270
I can help you get through this.

37:17.486 --> 37:18.976
I don't know if you can.

37:20.531 --> 37:23.819
Cisco, there is a whole
other life inside me.

37:24.535 --> 37:28.278
Hundreds of lives
that I need to know about.

37:30.833 --> 37:32.289
I think I need to do it by myself.

37:33.001 --> 37:36.209
I have to embrace my destiny.

37:40.843 --> 37:42.674
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

37:44.012 --> 37:46.139
You don't have to do this.

37:52.396 --> 37:53.681
What's going on?

37:53.897 --> 37:56.513
Nothing. I just like to speed
into rooms. usually.

37:56.733 --> 37:58.439
ARROW: Uh-huh. And where do you think
we ﬁnd this thing?

37:58.610 --> 38:01.192
I haven't been in
one of these places in a while.

38:04.783 --> 38:05.818
imam-1m

38:06.034 --> 38:09.822
Something you're not used to
saying very often, I'd imagine.

38:11.331 --> 38:13.663
You tried those arrows
once before, remember?

38:13.876 --> 38:16.288
They didn't quite ﬁnish the job,
now did they?

38:16.503 --> 38:18.164
I'm not gonna make that mistake again.

38:18.380 --> 38:19.620
You're gonna leave Kendra alone.

38:19.840 --> 38:22.832
I can't do that.
While my destiny is to live forever,

38:23.051 --> 38:25.884
Chay-Ara's is to die, as is yours now.

38:40.486 --> 38:42.351
-Any ideas?
-Oh, now you'll listen to me?

38:42.571 --> 38:43.902
It's your city.

38:51.747 --> 38:53.408
-On my mark.
-All right.

38:57.336 --> 39:00.043
Carter was right.
Something's holding me back.

39:00.255 --> 39:02.246
Maybe it's Central City, or you.

39:02.466 --> 39:03.922
Or what I thought my life was going to be.

39:04.134 --> 39:06.591
But I'm never gonna become
who I really am unless I let go.

39:07.429 --> 39:08.635
I have to do this.

39:14.269 --> 39:16.305
(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

39:17.064 --> 39:20.898
(CHUCKLES) In all my countless years,
I've never encountered

39:21.109 --> 39:24.693
anybody with your capabilities.
Astonishing!

39:25.906 --> 39:27.146
151i

39:35.999 --> 39:37.159
Chay-Ara...

39:37.876 --> 39:39.787
(CHUCKLING) Oh, my Godl

39:41.755 --> 39:42.790
(EXCLAIMING)

39:42.965 --> 39:47.709
I used to enjoy slow deaths.
Now, Ijust ﬁnd them boring.

39:57.980 --> 39:59.595
(EXHALES) Thanks.

39:59.815 --> 40:01.555
Yeah. Any chance he blew
himself up in there?

40:01.775 --> 40:02.810
Not likely.

40:02.985 --> 40:04.646
So that's like a tie. right?

40:04.987 --> 40:06.727
-I guess.
-I will take it.

40:07.322 --> 40:08.983
(EXCLAIMING)

40:23.714 --> 40:24.749
Hey, are you okay?

40:25.007 --> 40:26.668
I'm gonna have to learn
how to use these things.

40:27.009 --> 40:28.044
(CHUCKLES)

40:28.218 --> 40:31.051
You'll get the hang of it, Hawkgirl.

40:38.812 --> 40:42.225
Dr. Wells, you're gonna be okay.

40:44.359 --> 40:45.474
That's good news.

40:46.486 --> 40:49.694
You will probably be very sore
for a little while, though.

40:52.993 --> 40:54.199
Yes. it is.

40:59.875 --> 41:00.990
How you doing, Garrick?

41:02.377 --> 41:03.753
Your serum's out of my system.

41:04.838 --> 41:06.248
And I will never take it again.

41:13.013 --> 41:14.128
Jay.

41:16.642 --> 41:18.052
Thank you.

41:18.268 --> 41:22.181
You can thank me by keeping
that Velocity-Six away from Bany.

41:31.907 --> 41:34.523
That was Oliver.
Savage has the Staff of Horus.

41:34.743 --> 41:37.359
He wants us all in Central City
as soon as possible.

41:37.579 --> 41:39.490
Okay, well, Laurel's already
there visiting her mom,

41:39.706 --> 41:41.697
so I'll call her and let her know
we're coming by.

41:41.917 --> 41:45.080
If Savage is in Central City,
then why are we going back there?

41:45.295 --> 41:46.375
So we can end this.

41:46.588 --> 41:49.250
And if anybody's gonna take down Savage.
it's gonna be Bany and Oliver.

41:49.466 --> 41:51.582
Plus. you've emerged.
It's gonna be much harder for him now.

41:51.802 --> 41:54.134
And together, all of us,
we can take him down once and for all.

41:54.346 --> 41:57.053
Okay. So how are we gonna get there?

41:57.933 --> 42:01.221
Did I mention I'm the CEO
of a big company with a private jet?

42:12.030 --> 42:13.691
Since when is that a thing?

42:14.282 --> 42:15.897
About eight months.

42:16.368 --> 42:18.950
Maybe if you save Star City,
you might get one, too.

42:20.706 --> 42:22.492
By the way, we still need to get Savage.

42:22.999 --> 42:24.125
We'll get him.

42:24.292 --> 42:25.372
(BOTH GRUNT)

42:27.045 --> 42:28.751
Watch yourself, buddy.

42:29.715 --> 42:31.000
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

42:33.093 --> 42:35.254
-Don't want to lose this guy.
-Thanks, mister.

42:35.470 --> 42:37.131
man
