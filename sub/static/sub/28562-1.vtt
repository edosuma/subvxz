The world as we
know it ended in 2018

04:31.980 --> 04:34.472
when the war between Earth and moon Nazis

04:34.483 --> 04:37.567
culminated in nuclear Armageddon.

04:37.569 --> 04:39.356
The last survivors from Earth

04:39.362 --> 04:41.228
boarded the only remaining craft

04:41.239 --> 04:43.526
capable of interplanetary travel,

04:43.533 --> 04:45.570
Vestial Celestials Amelia,

04:45.577 --> 04:48.115
and traveled to the dark side of the moon.

04:48.121 --> 04:51.455
The good news is humanity found a refuge.

04:51.458 --> 04:54.826
The bad news is it was in
a former Nazi moon base.

04:54.836 --> 04:58.705
They were living side by
side with former moon Nazis.

05:03.053 --> 05:07.593
My name is Obi and I live on
the dark side of the moon.

05:07.599 --> 05:09.886
How's that for a fancy opening line?

05:09.893 --> 05:11.805
I've lived here my whole life

05:11.812 --> 05:16.648
along with the last 1980
humans left in the universe

05:16.650 --> 05:19.313
or so we thought.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.435
What am I looking at?

05:21.446 --> 05:23.608
An oval ship, ma'am.

05:23.615 --> 05:25.231
On its way from Earth.

05:25.242 --> 05:27.950
How did someone get one
of those things airborne?

05:27.953 --> 05:30.195
Who's even left on Earth
to get it airborne?

05:30.205 --> 05:31.205
It's heading here?

05:32.415 --> 05:34.828
Straight course
for the landing dome.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.371
The hatch is closed, right?

05:38.088 --> 05:40.455
The hatch is opening?

05:45.136 --> 05:46.216
It's opening, it's opening!

05:48.932 --> 05:51.049
Sir, we are receiving an
override signal from the craft.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.925
Well turn it off, shut it down!

05:52.936 --> 05:54.643
That's not how override signals work.

05:54.646 --> 05:56.638
We've gotta get people out of there.

05:56.648 --> 05:58.230
Evacuate, seal the dome!

05:58.233 --> 06:00.225
Anyway to tell who's on that ship?

06:00.235 --> 06:02.943
Ma'am, we have pinged every
comm frequency we have.

06:02.946 --> 06:05.404
If they have an override code,

06:05.407 --> 06:07.273
they must be from the base.

06:07.284 --> 06:09.992
We don't know who they
are and what they want.

06:09.995 --> 06:10.906
I can't let them land.

06:10.912 --> 06:13.199
So what's the alternative,
mom, shoot them down?

06:13.206 --> 06:14.913
The last thing we need is any more Nazis

06:14.916 --> 06:15.952
back on this station.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.337
Obi!

06:23.758 --> 06:24.589
Stop her!

06:24.593 --> 06:25.959
Warning, pressure dropping

06:25.969 --> 06:27.505
in landing bay.

06:27.512 --> 06:29.174
Evacuate immediately.

06:37.355 --> 06:38.641
We are ready to fire, ma'am.

06:38.648 --> 06:39.729
Are you okay?

06:46.865 --> 06:47.981
What is this?

06:47.991 --> 06:49.573
God, what the hell?

06:52.329 --> 06:54.696
She went over here!

06:54.706 --> 06:55.617
Maybe over here!

07:03.423 --> 07:04.459
Obi, what's going on?

07:04.466 --> 07:07.083
Are we shutting down section by section?

07:15.101 --> 07:16.342
We're up.

07:16.353 --> 07:17.514
Sir, I think she's in the hangar.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.102
What?

07:19.105 --> 07:20.105
Oh no.

07:21.566 --> 07:22.566
Abort fire!

07:29.908 --> 07:31.615
Okay.

07:31.618 --> 07:32.618
Here we go.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.327
environment

07:35.330 --> 07:36.446
detect pressure rising.

07:36.456 --> 07:40.541
Please use devices.

07:48.176 --> 07:49.176
What the hell?

07:50.345 --> 07:51.345
What?

07:52.639 --> 07:53.470
What is she doing?

07:53.473 --> 07:54.714
She's going to save them.

08:17.205 --> 08:18.662
Bring security.

08:18.665 --> 08:19.665
A lot of it.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.208
Obi Anija Washington.

08:22.210 --> 08:23.997
You could have gotten yourself hurt.

08:28.633 --> 08:30.295
Hello moon people!

08:32.261 --> 08:33.378
Who are you?

08:33.388 --> 08:34.629
My name is Sasha.

08:37.058 --> 08:38.058
Relax.

08:39.269 --> 08:41.727
We come from Russia.

08:41.730 --> 08:44.814
Well, was Russia before this Earth,

08:44.816 --> 08:47.183
how we say, blowed up.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.310
And what is this supposed to be?

08:49.320 --> 08:50.481
Girl.

08:50.488 --> 08:51.604
What is look like?

08:51.614 --> 08:52.821
It's my ship, Koya.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.076
I built it myself.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.283
Hey, hey, hey, no touching.

08:59.289 --> 09:01.030
Looks like you covered it in glue

09:01.041 --> 09:02.532
and rolled it through a junkyard.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.875
Well concern was to save my people,

09:04.878 --> 09:07.211
not making beautiful sculpture.

09:13.678 --> 09:17.217
Did you use a TPMS to
regulate the landing rockets.

09:17.223 --> 09:18.759
Yes, from.

09:20.226 --> 09:22.388
Had to root to exhaust manifold...

09:22.395 --> 09:23.260
But that's not possible.

09:23.271 --> 09:25.809
There's no way to hold
power without a D30.

09:25.815 --> 09:28.182
It's easy to bypass with two...

09:28.193 --> 09:29.604
Bullshit, then why didn't you use one?

09:29.611 --> 09:30.977
Why didn't you use one?

09:30.987 --> 09:33.855
We were slowly dying on
the radiation planet.

09:33.865 --> 09:35.777
Not leaving in one party dies, okay?

09:35.784 --> 09:36.784
Excuse me.

09:37.494 --> 09:39.030
May I be in charge for a minute?

09:40.622 --> 09:42.454
You the boss lady?

09:42.457 --> 09:43.457
Mm-hmm.

09:45.043 --> 09:46.659
You looking for paradise,
I got news for you.

09:46.669 --> 09:47.669
Obi, enough.

09:48.630 --> 09:50.337
How do you know about the moon base?

09:50.340 --> 09:51.376
It's programmed in the computer.

09:51.382 --> 09:53.465
Knows how to get home.

09:53.468 --> 09:57.508
It's like a,, pigeon.

09:57.514 --> 09:59.005
Like a metal space pigeon.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.802
Damn straight it's a pigeon.

10:02.268 --> 10:03.268
Sorry.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.512
I'm sorry but you can't stay here.

10:06.523 --> 10:08.105
We barely have enough food and supplies

10:08.108 --> 10:09.519
for the people already here.

10:10.777 --> 10:11.777
Mom.

10:14.864 --> 10:15.945
Look at them.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.941
We can't send them back.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.194
Especially not on this thing.

10:21.204 --> 10:22.740
I have a responsibility.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.919
Put them in the storage rooms for now.

10:30.922 --> 10:32.709
Post guard so that they can't leave.

10:34.926 --> 10:36.918
I will see what I will do with them later.

10:36.928 --> 10:40.092
Move the refugees to storage room 27.

10:40.098 --> 10:42.055
Feed 'em, give 'em blankets.

10:42.058 --> 10:44.015
Appreciate the hospitality.

10:45.728 --> 10:49.017
Come on, move it along, go.

10:49.023 --> 10:51.561
Girl, come visit me tonight, no?

10:51.568 --> 10:53.651
I can tell you about the,

10:53.653 --> 10:55.235
maybe other things.

11:03.663 --> 11:04.995
Have you tried
our fresh alki-burgers,

11:04.998 --> 11:06.409
the hamburger?

11:06.416 --> 11:07.998
Come to the market at level 17.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.082
I'm not sure they would've

11:09.085 --> 11:10.701
been in such a hurry to get up here

11:10.712 --> 11:13.250
if they knew what a shit
hole this place was.

11:13.256 --> 11:16.215
Overpopulated, under-supplied,
and very little

11:16.217 --> 11:18.129
in the way of medicine, hygiene,

11:18.136 --> 11:19.502
or skilled professionals.

11:19.512 --> 11:22.971
I mean literally, it's falling to pieces.

11:22.974 --> 11:24.590
If it's not the helium three reactor

11:24.601 --> 11:27.139
that blows, another random moon quake

11:27.145 --> 11:29.762
takes down the life support and of course,

11:29.772 --> 11:31.138
I am the only one who bothers

11:31.149 --> 11:33.106
to learn how to fix things around here.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.985
Moon quake alert.

11:39.991 --> 11:41.732
Moon quake alert.

11:41.743 --> 11:45.407
Stay close to the walls and
wait for the quake to end.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.714
Air pressure dropping.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.814
Air pressure stabilized.

12:24.369 --> 12:26.031
You okay, you okay?

12:26.037 --> 12:27.824
It's gonna be alright.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.287
As it's been so often

12:29.290 --> 12:32.454
throughout history, while
the regular people suffer,

12:32.460 --> 12:34.668
one group has all they need.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.287
I'll spare you the bloody details,

12:36.297 --> 12:39.631
but today the Jobsists
are the official religion

12:39.634 --> 12:41.500
on the moon base.

12:41.511 --> 12:45.050
I have a question for
you about this moon base.

12:45.056 --> 12:48.345
Are we in a closed
system or an open system?

12:58.695 --> 13:00.152
It is a closed system.

13:03.408 --> 13:05.650
And it is only in a closed system

13:06.536 --> 13:09.529
where we control all the inputs

13:09.539 --> 13:12.998
so the outputs will be in harmony.

13:13.918 --> 13:16.456
There are two types of
people in this world.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.124
How many people who love...

13:18.131 --> 13:19.667
Shut the fuck up, sweetheart.

13:22.385 --> 13:23.796
It is a perfect mechanism.

13:26.180 --> 13:29.048
Now let us pray for
our holy father, Steve,

13:29.058 --> 13:30.174
to shed light on us.

13:33.688 --> 13:36.305
Look at your ePrayer apps.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.902
Holy Steve, who art in the cloud,

13:41.904 --> 13:44.237
hallowed be thy designs.

13:44.240 --> 13:49.110
Thy will return as the CEO
when others have failed us.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.453
Give us our inflated devices prices...

13:51.456 --> 13:53.038
There's somebody here who does not

13:53.041 --> 13:55.203
appreciate flawless design.

14:02.759 --> 14:06.753
Someone who considers themself power user.

14:12.226 --> 14:13.226
You.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.765
Let me see your phone.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.114
Jail-broken.

14:33.081 --> 14:35.368
Why don't you want to
be like everyone else?

14:36.667 --> 14:39.910
Is our selection of default
wallpapers not sufficient?

14:39.921 --> 14:42.959
Do we not provide you with an
adequate choice in ringtones?

14:47.053 --> 14:50.012
You know what happens when
unauthorized changes are made.

14:53.601 --> 14:54.842
You get bricky bricked.

14:57.563 --> 14:58.563
No, no.

14:59.357 --> 15:04.352
No, no, no!

15:04.695 --> 15:06.231
I believe in Steve, I believe in Steve!

15:06.239 --> 15:09.073
I believe Steve, I believe in Steve!

15:09.075 --> 15:10.156
I believe in...

15:10.159 --> 15:11.616
Have a nice afterlife.

15:21.921 --> 15:22.921
Hi Obi.

15:27.593 --> 15:28.800
Lena.

15:28.803 --> 15:31.716
You left all these people out here to die.

15:31.722 --> 15:34.089
The temple is open only
for those true in faith.

15:34.100 --> 15:37.184
Like the guy that maniac
just blew into atoms?

15:37.186 --> 15:38.393
He was excommunicated.

15:40.189 --> 15:43.273
He was probably a hacker
or a pirate or both.

15:46.821 --> 15:47.652
Hey.

15:47.655 --> 15:48.655
Here.

15:52.410 --> 15:53.410
Man's got a point.

16:29.572 --> 16:32.565
Do you have any idea how
much those doors cost?

16:32.575 --> 16:34.237
Do you have any idea how many people

16:34.243 --> 16:35.859
were stuck out in a hallway?

16:35.870 --> 16:37.736
The system must remain closed.

16:37.747 --> 16:38.954
How long you think your
system will hold up

16:38.956 --> 16:40.913
if I change the WiFi password, huh?

16:44.837 --> 16:45.827
Okay.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.545
Ceremony over.

16:47.548 --> 16:49.084
Everybody go back home.

16:51.552 --> 16:52.552
Mom?

16:53.846 --> 16:55.007
Mom.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.755
Hello sweetheart.

16:56.766 --> 16:57.847
Why are you in here?

16:59.393 --> 17:01.806
Did you know what was going on outside?

17:03.856 --> 17:05.222
Mom, where's your medicine?

17:06.150 --> 17:08.311
You don't need to worry
about me, sweetheart.

17:08.319 --> 17:09.150
Yes I do.

17:09.153 --> 17:09.983
I'm fine.

17:09.987 --> 17:11.853
I have to worry about everyone.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.730
Ever since dad died, I'm the only person

17:13.741 --> 17:15.607
keeping this place running.

17:15.617 --> 17:17.483
The moon quakes are getting worse.

17:17.494 --> 17:19.737
The wirings in the
hallways are all corroded.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.739
The centrifugal blowers are, I mean mom,

17:21.749 --> 17:24.742
I don't know how long I
can keep the life support

17:24.752 --> 17:26.163
working without help.

17:32.093 --> 17:33.174
Thank you, Donald.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.760
We offer simple solutions
for every problem.

17:36.639 --> 17:39.302
All we ask people is think different.

17:39.308 --> 17:40.719
Fuck off.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.433
Obi Anija.

17:42.436 --> 17:44.223
You will never find a man if
you keep talking like that.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.892
Mom, I don't need a man, okay?

17:45.898 --> 17:46.898
I'm fine.

17:48.943 --> 17:50.400
Commander.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.269
Hello Malcolm.

17:52.280 --> 17:53.521
Hey Malcolm.

17:53.531 --> 17:54.531
Ms. Washington.

17:55.241 --> 17:56.948
I heard you saved the day out there.

17:58.744 --> 17:59.951
Not bad.

17:59.954 --> 18:00.785
Yeah, thanks.

18:00.788 --> 18:02.450
It was, you know, nothing.

18:04.959 --> 18:06.825
Well, I'd better be off.

18:06.836 --> 18:08.077
I'll see you girls later.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.340
He's such a fine young man.

18:14.594 --> 18:17.211
And you two would make beautiful babies.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.097
What?

18:22.184 --> 18:24.141
Here's
what's left of Amelia.

18:25.021 --> 18:27.889
Poor girl was cannibalized
for parts years ago.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.729
And no one stopped to
think what we would do

18:31.736 --> 18:36.071
if the only spacecraft
left was torn to pieces.

19:43.766 --> 19:46.304
You see the .6
G soccer match yesterday?

19:46.310 --> 19:47.221
Oh yeah.

19:49.105 --> 19:53.190
Can't understand
how we've become so bad at it.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.205
Who are you?

22:20.923 --> 22:22.755
You know who I am.

22:30.933 --> 22:31.933
The moon fuhrer?

22:34.061 --> 22:36.269
My mother watched you die.

22:38.482 --> 22:39.482
Your mother.

22:46.365 --> 22:47.365
My.

22:48.951 --> 22:49.782
What about it?

22:49.785 --> 22:50.741
Where is it?

22:50.744 --> 22:53.077
It's been gathering moon
dust for the last 20 years.

22:56.542 --> 22:58.875
You humans.

23:00.713 --> 23:03.376
All you want to do is
destroy what I created!

23:07.511 --> 23:09.173
Like I destroyed your lazy.

23:11.599 --> 23:13.431
Stop it, human.

23:23.444 --> 23:25.151
No, don't do that.

23:25.154 --> 23:26.154
You need me!

23:27.489 --> 23:29.902
Your mother is sick!

23:36.582 --> 23:38.574
What do you think you know about that?

23:39.418 --> 23:40.954
What do I need you for, huh?

23:45.049 --> 23:46.335
Give this to her.

23:47.551 --> 23:49.918
It will make her feel better.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.887
What do you have to lose?

23:52.890 --> 23:54.552
You know she's going to die soon.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.588
Mom, you okay?

24:34.598 --> 24:35.598
Obi.

24:37.226 --> 24:38.137
Mom.

24:38.143 --> 24:39.143
What is that?

24:40.813 --> 24:42.349
You gotta bare with me, okay?

24:46.360 --> 24:47.360
You gotta try it.

25:41.415 --> 25:42.747
What was that?

25:47.463 --> 25:49.796
Where did you get that from?

25:53.427 --> 25:54.668
I'll be right back.

26:25.375 --> 26:26.832
I knew you would be back.

26:26.835 --> 26:27.835
Explain.

26:28.712 --> 26:30.829
It's called Vril-Ya.

26:30.839 --> 26:32.421
It is pure energy.

26:33.842 --> 26:37.051
It powers all our ships
and made us live forever.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.046
Us who?

26:44.019 --> 26:46.636
You have to cut
me loose so I can show you.

26:47.898 --> 26:49.658
Better not try
anything funny, old man.

27:03.747 --> 27:04.747
We are...

27:27.229 --> 27:28.229
The Vril.

27:30.232 --> 27:34.101
A long time ago, we arrived on this planet

27:34.111 --> 27:36.398
after a very long journey.

27:40.117 --> 27:42.325
Our ship was heavily damaged.

27:44.788 --> 27:46.654
But we were in luck.

27:46.665 --> 27:51.660
We had found a planet with
air and water and life.

27:55.090 --> 27:57.673
My fool of a brother was in charge.

27:59.052 --> 28:04.047
He ordered us to try and
make contact with the locals.

28:04.975 --> 28:07.843
I told him it was a mistake.

28:07.853 --> 28:10.220
Of course I was proven right.

28:17.487 --> 28:21.197
We were the only intelligent
creatures on the planet.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.237
It was ours.

28:26.455 --> 28:28.663
We studied the flora and fauna.

28:29.791 --> 28:33.501
While the others obsessed over big game,

28:33.503 --> 28:36.086
I focused on the small.

28:38.175 --> 28:39.711
A new order had arisen.

28:40.802 --> 28:42.213
The primates.

28:44.056 --> 28:47.015
Then, I did something I knew my brother

28:47.017 --> 28:48.224
would never understand.

28:55.609 --> 28:59.569
I stole some of our precious Vril-Ya

28:59.571 --> 29:04.566
and gave it to my two
favorites, Adam and Eve.

29:05.202 --> 29:09.287
I could have waited, let
nature take its course,

29:09.289 --> 29:12.248
but why not give evolution a nudge?

29:12.251 --> 29:15.335
But I learned soon that
the paradise was doomed.

29:31.311 --> 29:33.394
My brother ordered us to take our ship

29:33.397 --> 29:35.059
and move underground.

29:36.233 --> 29:40.318
You see, the Earth is hollow.

29:42.948 --> 29:47.192
In the center you find enough Vril-Ya

29:47.202 --> 29:48.202
for all of us.

29:54.126 --> 29:56.118
Enough to power your ship.

29:57.170 --> 29:59.537
Enough to keep your mother alive.

30:02.009 --> 30:06.470
The other Vrils are not as nice as I am.

30:06.471 --> 30:07.882
They hate your kind.

30:09.099 --> 30:11.307
Won't be easy to get
the Vril-Ya from them.

30:13.103 --> 30:14.514
Wasn't planning on asking.

30:16.481 --> 30:17.847
Oh, how human of you.

30:26.658 --> 30:29.071
The entrance to the hollow earth

30:29.077 --> 30:33.162
lies between two mountains on Antarctica.

30:34.166 --> 30:35.657
Entrance to hollow Earth?

30:37.502 --> 30:38.913
Okay.

30:38.920 --> 30:39.876
And once I'm down there?

30:39.880 --> 30:42.418
You find the city of Agartha.

30:43.383 --> 30:45.500
In the middle of the city lies a temple

30:45.510 --> 30:47.672
where they keep the Vril-Ya

30:47.679 --> 30:52.014
in a simple vessel called the holy grail.

30:52.017 --> 30:53.017
What's your angle?

30:54.102 --> 30:55.309
Why so eager to help?

30:56.271 --> 30:58.888
I'm running out of option, my dear.

30:59.983 --> 31:00.983
Just like you.

31:04.654 --> 31:06.816
But you have to go soon.

31:06.823 --> 31:08.064
Take that Russian with you.

31:08.075 --> 31:09.486
What, no!

31:09.493 --> 31:11.234
What, you want to fly
that ship by yourself?

31:11.244 --> 31:12.280
Why don't you go with me?

31:12.287 --> 31:13.949
Ah, no, no, no.

31:15.123 --> 31:17.581
My presence would only expose us all.

31:21.338 --> 31:23.955
But there's something I want you to have.

31:23.965 --> 31:25.297
Gross, I don't want that.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.046
Can come in handy.

31:29.429 --> 31:30.429
Fingering.

31:48.657 --> 31:50.694
If this is gonna
work, you have to promise

31:50.700 --> 31:54.319
to keep your mouth shut and
do exactly as I tell you.

31:54.329 --> 31:57.993
Ah, only need Sasha for muscles.

31:57.999 --> 32:00.833
Okay, you will be impressed, girl.

32:00.836 --> 32:05.046
Back at station,
they call me the Siberian bear.

32:05.048 --> 32:06.038
You ever seen bear?

32:06.049 --> 32:08.257
I fight them all the time.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.217
If you see true Russian bear...

32:12.139 --> 32:13.675
Donald.

32:13.682 --> 32:16.140
Ever thought of driving
that thing off a cliff?

32:16.143 --> 32:19.432
I hear this time of year is very nice

32:19.438 --> 32:21.976
at the center of the Earth.

32:24.025 --> 32:25.891
I know about your little trip.

32:25.902 --> 32:26.733
I want in.

32:26.736 --> 32:28.102
Girl, you need...

32:28.113 --> 32:28.944
Shut up.

32:28.947 --> 32:29.947
Stay there.

32:31.074 --> 32:34.283
Obi, let's put our differences aside.

32:35.370 --> 32:37.908
I need your help.

32:37.914 --> 32:40.998
Why would I ever help you?

32:41.001 --> 32:43.038
You and I both know the truth.

32:45.589 --> 32:48.002
The moon is not going to be here for long.

32:48.008 --> 32:50.341
Soon enough we will all be dead.

32:52.762 --> 32:54.970
I just need some comfort for my flock.

32:57.058 --> 33:00.096
Alright, sure.

33:02.230 --> 33:03.230
Let's go.

33:08.487 --> 33:09.477
What was this?

33:09.488 --> 33:11.400
Why you allow them to come?

33:11.406 --> 33:14.399
Might be the only way I can
finally get rid of them.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.076
Okay, stop.

33:20.040 --> 33:22.532
Alright, we need to get rid of him.

33:22.542 --> 33:23.783
I'll go find something big.

33:23.793 --> 33:25.250
Stay here, don't talk.

33:28.256 --> 33:31.840
The red goes here
and the white right here.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.317
Hey!

33:54.658 --> 33:56.069
Dude.

33:56.076 --> 33:58.443
This is like a fully
punch resistant outfit.

33:58.453 --> 34:00.661
How did that make any sense in your brain?

34:02.374 --> 34:03.285
Hey Donald.

34:03.291 --> 34:04.998
What's up Brian, Kyler, Fat Tyler?

34:07.170 --> 34:08.661
Obi?

34:08.672 --> 34:09.708
Malcolm.

34:09.714 --> 34:11.170
What are you guys doing here?

34:11.174 --> 34:13.130
Uh, sorry.

34:13.969 --> 34:15.460
We really didn't know that was you.

34:15.469 --> 34:16.960
Hello, I am hurt one.

34:18.223 --> 34:19.554
Listen.

34:19.558 --> 34:22.175
We are gonna steal that Valcore,

34:22.185 --> 34:23.301
head to the center of the Earth

34:23.311 --> 34:25.928
which is apparently hollow and hopefully

34:25.938 --> 34:28.056
find the one thing that
can get my ship running

34:28.065 --> 34:32.106
and save my mom and basically
the whole of mankind, okay?

34:35.739 --> 34:36.739
Okay, cool.

34:37.617 --> 34:38.447
Can I go?

34:38.451 --> 34:39.282
Yes!

34:39.286 --> 34:40.618
I mean yeah, sure, we
could use the muscle.

34:40.620 --> 34:41.906
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.574
Excuse me, it's my job.

34:46.042 --> 34:47.158
Who is that?

34:47.168 --> 34:47.998
Who are you?

34:48.003 --> 34:49.460
Listen tough boy.

34:49.462 --> 34:50.668
Team is full.

34:50.672 --> 34:52.129
Already have all the...

34:54.467 --> 34:55.708
Muscles we need.

34:58.555 --> 35:00.842
Hey, Malcolm, not that I'm complaining

35:00.849 --> 35:03.592
but shouldn't you keep the armor on?

35:03.602 --> 35:05.594
It's gonna be dangerous.

35:05.604 --> 35:06.435
Huh?

35:06.438 --> 35:08.976
Oh, that's not mine.

35:08.982 --> 35:11.816
There's like an insane fine
if I wear that off duty.

35:11.818 --> 35:13.150
Anyway, it's okay.

35:14.237 --> 35:16.149
I got my lucky shirt.

35:16.156 --> 35:17.397
Lucky shirt.

35:17.407 --> 35:18.773
Alright.

35:18.783 --> 35:20.240
Let's do this.

35:21.745 --> 35:24.237
Yeah, let's do this.

35:24.247 --> 35:25.829
Next stop, Earth.

35:25.832 --> 35:27.414
Years of nuclear winter

35:27.417 --> 35:29.909
have rendered the surface uninhabitable.

35:29.919 --> 35:33.538
What fun and adventures we'll have there.

35:33.548 --> 35:36.712
Or we'll die a horrible radiation death.

35:36.718 --> 35:37.718
Buckle up.

35:41.973 --> 35:44.090
Man, it's cold in here.

35:44.100 --> 35:46.012
Oh sorry, you want me
to put on the heater.

35:46.019 --> 35:47.510
Yeah, yeah, that'd be great.

35:48.438 --> 35:49.474
I don't have any.

35:59.449 --> 36:02.817
Are you sure this thing can
handle atmospheric reentry?

36:02.827 --> 36:04.068
Please, girl, it'll hold.

36:04.079 --> 36:04.944
I build it.

36:04.954 --> 36:05.954
Just read the map.

36:09.167 --> 36:13.832
So the map says we should
be headed toward Antarctica.

36:15.173 --> 36:18.257
Look for big ice sheets or something.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.089
Well that helps.

36:21.096 --> 36:23.463
Half the world is covered
in ice these days.

36:25.100 --> 36:26.307
Oh.

36:26.309 --> 36:27.800
Yeah.

36:48.623 --> 36:49.623
Anyway.

36:51.835 --> 36:56.421
Head south toward that
big building over there.

36:58.466 --> 36:59.422
What is that place?

36:59.426 --> 37:01.088
Beats me.

37:01.094 --> 37:02.710
Let's just land down slowly.

37:05.473 --> 37:06.884
What are you doing?

37:06.891 --> 37:08.052
Adjusting the yaw.

37:08.059 --> 37:09.516
It's not yaw, it's pitch!

37:09.519 --> 37:10.760
Get your head down!

37:11.688 --> 37:14.931
Who puts the pitch where
the yaw's supposed to be?

37:30.915 --> 37:32.122
What was that?

37:32.125 --> 37:33.332
Congratulations, girl.

37:34.377 --> 37:35.288
You broke it.

37:35.295 --> 37:37.161
No I didn't!

37:41.634 --> 37:44.843
Stay very, very still.

37:53.313 --> 37:55.350
I can't turn the ship, you broke it!

37:55.356 --> 37:56.346
I didn't break anything!

37:56.357 --> 37:57.723
It was already in pieces.

37:57.734 --> 38:00.522
Don't touch anything anymore!

38:00.528 --> 38:01.644
We're gonna crash!

38:01.654 --> 38:03.816
It's your fault!

38:08.328 --> 38:09.409
Pull this!

38:09.412 --> 38:10.573
It won't work!

38:14.083 --> 38:15.073
I knew it!

38:15.084 --> 38:16.200
Russian quality!

38:16.211 --> 38:19.329
Don't blame me, it's German engineering!

38:31.100 --> 38:33.433
Okay, okay, I'm fine.

38:33.436 --> 38:34.436
I'm fine.

38:35.146 --> 38:36.182
Are you fine?

38:36.189 --> 38:37.600
Yeah, I'm fine.

38:45.615 --> 38:48.107
Okay, everybody out.

38:56.835 --> 38:58.622
This is the last time I'm getting

38:58.628 --> 39:00.039
into anything built by you.

39:01.130 --> 39:02.962
Would have been fine if
not touch pitch button.

39:02.966 --> 39:04.252
I told you it was faulty.

39:04.259 --> 39:06.216
I'm surprised the whole
thing didn't explode.

39:06.219 --> 39:08.586
The CDI and the OBS were
completely miscalibrated.

39:08.596 --> 39:09.427
Uh, guys.

39:09.430 --> 39:11.342
Did you get that SL meter from an old...

39:11.349 --> 39:12.180
Guys!

39:12.183 --> 39:13.640
Actually I did, so what?

39:15.812 --> 39:16.812
Holy shit.

39:24.445 --> 39:25.777
Maybe goes without saying

39:25.780 --> 39:28.488
but we didn't expect to see this.

39:29.659 --> 39:31.901
Wow, shit.

39:31.911 --> 39:33.652
Turns out it was all true.

39:34.747 --> 39:37.330
I guess that means Vril-Ya really is

39:37.333 --> 39:41.293
powering that tiny adorable
little sun thing over there.

39:42.422 --> 39:46.632
And that's what we need.

39:46.634 --> 39:48.091
Alright, what do you think?

39:49.470 --> 39:52.087
Probably go around here
and then go in the middle.

39:56.144 --> 39:58.887
Did anyone think to bring a compass?

39:58.897 --> 40:00.479
Sorry.

40:00.481 --> 40:01.481
No reception.

40:05.028 --> 40:07.111
I thought I had it somewhere.

40:19.751 --> 40:20.751
Wow.

40:21.544 --> 40:25.037
Is that a, whoa, yeah.

40:26.215 --> 40:28.923
Nokia 3310, is classic.

40:28.927 --> 40:31.920
My dad used to talk
about these all the time.

40:31.930 --> 40:32.761
Yeah, I remember that.

40:32.764 --> 40:34.175
First phone he ever had.

40:35.683 --> 40:37.390
Is this the original cover?

40:37.393 --> 40:38.725
It's indestructible.

40:38.728 --> 40:40.811
Survived nuclear war.

40:40.813 --> 40:44.932
Does this still do the menu star button?

40:44.943 --> 40:46.229
Yeah, auto-lock.

40:47.612 --> 40:49.069
Of course.

40:49.072 --> 40:50.859
All the original ringtones?

40:50.865 --> 40:51.901
Absolutely.

40:52.825 --> 40:53.825
Snake?

40:56.204 --> 40:57.365
Unbeatable high score.

41:03.586 --> 41:05.327
Man, you should put that away.

41:05.338 --> 41:06.328
If that freak sees you,
he'll excommunicate you

41:06.339 --> 41:07.625
in a heartbeat.

41:08.675 --> 41:09.506
Exco-what?

41:09.509 --> 41:10.340
You don't wanna know.

41:10.343 --> 41:11.343
Just put it away.

41:13.137 --> 41:15.254
Actually, let me see it again.

41:17.225 --> 41:18.181
So which one is it?

41:18.184 --> 41:20.346
Put it away or give?

41:20.353 --> 41:21.639
It can't be both.

41:21.646 --> 41:23.729
Does this thing have a compass?

41:23.731 --> 41:25.939
No, it's just games.

41:27.110 --> 41:28.110
Settings.

41:29.696 --> 41:30.527
Tools.

41:30.530 --> 41:31.896
Yeah, check tools.

41:31.906 --> 41:33.397
It's calculator,.

41:38.037 --> 41:39.037
Compass.

41:40.999 --> 41:44.413
Works perfectly and no WiFi needed.

41:46.004 --> 41:47.004
This is it.

41:48.172 --> 41:49.253
The promised land.

41:50.842 --> 41:54.335
The perfect closed system where
we can control everything.

41:56.097 --> 41:57.178
This is what I want.

41:59.392 --> 42:02.100
Ryan, open your PowerPoint.

42:02.103 --> 42:04.436
I'm going to dictate some slides.

42:06.858 --> 42:07.858
Alright people.

42:09.110 --> 42:11.022
I've got a strong feeling it's this way.

42:11.029 --> 42:12.645
Follow me.

42:12.655 --> 42:15.238
Let's go meet the CEO of this place.

42:28.087 --> 42:29.087
Hold on.

42:31.299 --> 42:32.756
I'll go check it out.

42:32.759 --> 42:36.218
That sounds like the exact
opposite of what you should do.

42:36.220 --> 42:37.381
Malcolm, Malc.

42:38.389 --> 42:39.389
Malc, Malc!

42:46.064 --> 42:50.229
Don't worry, I keep you safe here.

42:51.861 --> 42:54.319
Really, you gonna keep me safe?

42:56.532 --> 42:58.489
What, you don't believe me?

43:00.328 --> 43:04.868
Girl, I have experience
fighting bear, also tiger.

43:04.874 --> 43:07.537
In Russia, in my camp, we
have many hungry animal.

43:10.296 --> 43:11.296
Malc?

43:14.008 --> 43:15.670
This place is crazy.

43:15.676 --> 43:18.339
That things was like

43:18.346 --> 43:19.786
and I was like.

43:26.354 --> 43:28.346
Promise me you'll never do that again.

43:28.356 --> 43:29.472
We should probably go then

43:29.482 --> 43:31.394
because there's like
10 more of them coming.

43:31.400 --> 43:32.231
Where is the problem?

43:32.235 --> 43:34.898
10 against one is almost fair fight.

43:34.904 --> 43:35.904
We gotta go.

43:36.697 --> 43:37.608
Which way?

43:37.615 --> 43:38.615
Don't say that way.

43:41.035 --> 43:42.526
Well, um, I just,

43:44.664 --> 43:45.700
I just need a second.

43:48.126 --> 43:49.126
She doesn't know.

43:50.545 --> 43:51.545
We're lost.

43:52.463 --> 43:53.704
We're not lost.

43:53.714 --> 43:55.376
I said I just need a minute.

43:59.262 --> 44:02.972
Get off.

44:02.974 --> 44:03.974
It's wrong.

44:05.059 --> 44:06.059
It's this way.

44:07.645 --> 44:09.011
We just came from there.

44:10.523 --> 44:11.523
Wait.

44:12.191 --> 44:13.602
You're like actually insane?

44:15.361 --> 44:17.444
We are inside Earth.

44:17.446 --> 44:19.733
It's simple, it's like mirror.

44:19.740 --> 44:21.732
Only east is west and west is east.

44:23.870 --> 44:24.870
Me, crazy.

44:47.810 --> 44:50.348
The
legendary city of Agartha.

44:50.354 --> 44:53.062
At the center of the center of the Earth

44:53.065 --> 44:55.853
and at the center of that, the Vril-Ya.

44:55.860 --> 44:58.568
Unfortunately, the place is crawling

44:58.571 --> 45:01.314
with Vril and I'm not hugely fond

45:01.324 --> 45:04.317
of shapeshifting reptilian humanoids.

45:04.327 --> 45:06.489
This should be interesting.

45:24.096 --> 45:25.758
We have a union.

45:29.310 --> 45:30.642
Kaboom!

45:44.075 --> 45:45.862
Well, it certainly has

45:45.868 --> 45:49.532
been an interesting last few millennium

45:49.538 --> 45:52.406
with this whole infiltrate
the upper echelon

45:52.416 --> 45:54.408
of human society and manipulate them

45:54.418 --> 45:56.330
into destroying each other.

45:56.337 --> 45:58.454
Now, we might've just gone a little heavy

45:58.464 --> 46:00.330
on the political realm.

46:00.341 --> 46:03.300
Pardon me, madam, but in my own defense,

46:03.302 --> 46:06.136
I was far and away the first of us

46:06.138 --> 46:08.630
to swim those frigid waters.

46:10.101 --> 46:12.434
And we're all real proud of you, Caligula,

46:13.896 --> 46:17.435
but you went, for a lack
of a better word, insane

46:17.441 --> 46:19.649
and we've all learned that humans

46:19.652 --> 46:22.235
really don't like their
insanity being challenged

46:22.238 --> 46:25.402
and then there was that
little thing with your horse.

46:25.408 --> 46:27.024
We're just friends.

46:30.705 --> 46:33.948
My god, little Zucky, yo.

46:33.958 --> 46:36.871
Who knew that social media was gonna work?

46:36.877 --> 46:38.664
That was brilliant.

46:38.671 --> 46:41.414
Everyone too wrapped up in cat videos

46:41.424 --> 46:43.290
and sending dick pics to procreate

46:43.301 --> 46:44.917
instead of thinking with their brains.

46:44.927 --> 46:46.043
Very nice.

46:46.053 --> 46:48.420
Sure helped with my case
during the elections.

46:49.265 --> 46:53.726
And you two crazy kids with your crusades

46:53.728 --> 46:55.970
and your jihad or whatever
you wanna call it.

46:57.064 --> 46:59.226
Nothing like a little monotheism

46:59.233 --> 47:02.852
to throw people into centuries of battles

47:02.862 --> 47:06.105
over exactly the same ideology.

47:08.117 --> 47:10.700
And don't even get me started on Ady.

47:11.829 --> 47:15.948
Ady Hitler with the achtung, hail.

47:15.958 --> 47:17.244
Hail my sexiness, hail me.

47:21.047 --> 47:22.913
Oh shut up, you old drunk fool.

47:45.154 --> 47:46.861
What about me?

47:46.864 --> 47:50.448
You managed to destroy
all that human vermin

47:50.451 --> 47:53.785
but you destroyed everything
else along with them,

47:53.788 --> 47:55.324
madam president.

47:56.665 --> 47:57.665
Well.

47:59.251 --> 48:00.958
Total victory.

48:00.961 --> 48:02.748
All but a few stragglers gone

48:04.131 --> 48:06.589
and now the planet is ours gone.

48:06.592 --> 48:10.506
Yes, a beautiful, unlivable planet.

48:10.513 --> 48:13.051
Totally nuclear wasteland.

48:13.057 --> 48:15.925
Very good, Ms. President.

48:15.935 --> 48:17.676
I will say something.

48:17.686 --> 48:18.893
Shut up.

48:20.856 --> 48:22.597
Perhaps I wasn't paying attention

48:22.608 --> 48:25.066
but we still have our spaceship.

48:25.069 --> 48:27.277
Why can't we just take it and move

48:27.279 --> 48:28.645
to another planet?

48:29.865 --> 48:31.356
Space, Margaret.

48:32.451 --> 48:34.818
Space is huge.

48:34.829 --> 48:36.286
Where do you recommend we go?

48:37.581 --> 48:42.576
Second star to the right and
then straight till the morning?

48:43.170 --> 48:47.164
You know how difficult it is
to find a planet to live on?

48:48.968 --> 48:53.429
My brother created this pest,

48:54.723 --> 48:55.964
the humans.

48:57.852 --> 49:02.643
He will get punished
as soon as I find him.

49:04.483 --> 49:06.975
But we really didn't have to leave

49:07.987 --> 49:10.775
if you hadn't turned the surface

49:10.781 --> 49:14.195
into a radioactive mess.

49:16.579 --> 49:17.579
Ms. President.

49:18.998 --> 49:20.864
A total victory indeed.

49:22.251 --> 49:24.789
I really don't think there's
any reason to overreact.

49:26.547 --> 49:28.038
Please.

49:29.884 --> 49:31.671
Sit down, enjoy your meal.

49:38.058 --> 49:40.050
My dear sweet brother.

49:41.312 --> 49:42.644
I will find you.

49:43.772 --> 49:48.767
And when I find you, I dip
your head in a bucket of shit.

50:03.626 --> 50:04.626
Shit.

50:05.586 --> 50:06.586
Nuts.

50:07.963 --> 50:10.000
Alright, looks like
we're gonna take a left

50:10.007 --> 50:12.875
at this junction and then...

50:14.678 --> 50:15.885
Look, look, look, look, look.

50:15.888 --> 50:17.550
It's him!

50:17.556 --> 50:18.387
It's really him!

50:18.390 --> 50:19.551
He's still alive, I told you!

50:21.310 --> 50:22.517
Donald.

50:22.520 --> 50:24.853
I don't even know why
I have to tell you this

50:24.855 --> 50:25.936
but that's not him.

50:27.525 --> 50:29.016
How can you be sure?

50:29.026 --> 50:32.144
Because we're in the center of the Earth.

50:32.154 --> 50:35.067
Who knows how far his reality
distortion field extends?

50:36.367 --> 50:38.108
Perhaps we only think we're here

50:38.118 --> 50:40.861
because that is what
he wants us to believe.

50:40.871 --> 50:43.784
He is first among Steves.

50:43.791 --> 50:45.532
He will show us the path.

50:52.132 --> 50:54.545
We are not worthy.

50:55.386 --> 50:56.627
Okay, we gotta run.

51:00.891 --> 51:03.725
Greetings, your CEO-ship.

51:13.612 --> 51:15.023
So what is plan?

51:15.030 --> 51:17.738
Just give me a second, I
can come up with something.

51:22.955 --> 51:25.823
Maybe go back to running, no?

51:25.833 --> 51:27.495
Here, go, come on.

51:28.711 --> 51:29.827
You two go ahead.

51:29.837 --> 51:30.837
I'll hold 'em off.

51:59.700 --> 52:00.700
Come on.

52:01.452 --> 52:02.452
Let's go.

52:13.255 --> 52:14.496
I'm confused.

52:14.506 --> 52:16.088
What we gonna do next?

52:16.091 --> 52:17.957
We're gonna go get that grail.

52:17.968 --> 52:20.802
I thought we were
supposed to save your man.

52:20.804 --> 52:23.137
I know him, he can take care of himself.

52:23.140 --> 52:26.554
And I can't?

52:26.560 --> 52:28.768
I can't do this alone, okay?

52:30.773 --> 52:31.773
I need you.

53:12.398 --> 53:13.388
What's his name?

53:13.399 --> 53:14.935
IBM, IBM.

53:14.942 --> 53:17.685
Donkeys, Donald Trump, no.

53:17.695 --> 53:18.856
Look at the costume.

53:19.697 --> 53:20.528
King Nazi.

53:20.531 --> 53:21.738
King Nazi, that's it.

53:21.740 --> 53:23.402
I have so many questions.

53:24.368 --> 53:27.577
We can help each other, quid pro quo.

53:27.579 --> 53:29.115
You didn't let me finish.

53:31.417 --> 53:33.534
I have so many questions.

53:35.504 --> 53:39.999
Too bad that you're not going
to be alive to answer them.

53:50.310 --> 53:52.472
Nobody's getting killed.

53:54.064 --> 53:55.064
They need us.

53:58.026 --> 54:00.063
I have a business proposition for you.

54:03.073 --> 54:05.235
You're going to like this.

54:33.854 --> 54:35.015
How do you open it?

54:35.022 --> 54:36.183
I don't know.

54:38.108 --> 54:39.440
Stop.

54:39.443 --> 54:40.775
Give me paper.

54:46.283 --> 54:50.243
The structure says here
something about finger.

54:51.079 --> 54:52.866
Maybe it is gibberish.

54:52.873 --> 54:53.873
Maybe not.

54:58.420 --> 55:02.164
If you have an
idea, now is needed.

55:04.927 --> 55:06.008
What is that?

55:23.612 --> 55:24.612
Brother?

55:26.490 --> 55:27.490
Where is he?

55:28.700 --> 55:29.700
Quid pro quo.

55:31.370 --> 55:32.861
What do you want?

55:32.871 --> 55:35.705
I need you to bring my people here

55:35.707 --> 55:37.323
to the hollow Earth.

55:37.334 --> 55:40.122
So you can ruin Agartha

55:41.213 --> 55:43.079
like you have ruined the whole planet.

55:43.090 --> 55:46.424
Only my followers, only the Jobsists.

55:46.426 --> 55:49.919
We of all people appreciate
what you've done here.

55:49.930 --> 55:52.673
We will maintain it in perfect harmony.

55:54.142 --> 55:57.101
Donald, are you negotiating with Hitler?

55:57.104 --> 55:59.141
He is not well known for
keeping his promises.

55:59.147 --> 56:00.683
Czechoslovakia, anyone?

56:00.691 --> 56:02.057
Do you take me for a fool?

56:03.735 --> 56:07.194
I'm trying to get him to sign
an end user license agreement.

56:08.407 --> 56:09.898
No one reads that shit, man.

56:09.908 --> 56:12.525
He's just gonna do whatever he wants.

56:12.536 --> 56:16.075
It's a wholly binding contract.

56:16.081 --> 56:18.994
Siri, end user license agreement.

56:19.001 --> 56:21.584
Opening holy end
user license agreement.

56:22.546 --> 56:24.754
All that information
there is contingent

56:24.756 --> 56:25.587
upon whether or not...

56:25.591 --> 56:27.503
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

56:27.509 --> 56:28.509
Agree.

56:30.554 --> 56:31.761
Siri.

56:31.763 --> 56:33.299
Maps.

56:33.307 --> 56:35.720
Destination home.

56:35.726 --> 56:37.683
Calculating directions to home.

56:41.481 --> 56:42.517
Route planned.

56:42.524 --> 56:43.981
That explains a lot.

56:45.861 --> 56:47.853
The dark side of the moon.

56:52.618 --> 56:54.826
You did us a great service.

56:54.828 --> 56:58.788
Now we can finally leave
this horrible planet.

56:59.625 --> 57:00.661
Of course.

57:00.667 --> 57:03.330
A man's only as good as his exit strategy.

57:07.966 --> 57:09.377
I could brainstorm with you.

57:12.346 --> 57:14.133
Long as you deliver my people to me.

57:15.891 --> 57:17.507
Yeah.

57:17.517 --> 57:18.517
About that.

58:03.480 --> 58:04.766
Wow.

58:04.773 --> 58:06.435
The holy grail, huh?

58:17.369 --> 58:18.369
I'm gonna go get it.

58:25.168 --> 58:26.168
Be careful!

58:36.847 --> 58:39.510
It says here the grail
is attached to the base

58:39.516 --> 58:42.054
but can't be removed
without triggering some kind

58:42.060 --> 58:44.393
of self destruction.

58:46.023 --> 58:47.023
Wow.

58:50.027 --> 58:51.893
What do you think's the
weight of this thing?

58:51.903 --> 58:53.485
Why wait?

58:53.488 --> 58:54.979
Ah, weight, weight.

58:58.076 --> 59:00.113
It's about 84.

59:02.080 --> 59:02.991
Zork-what?

59:02.998 --> 59:04.330
Did you just make up that?

59:04.332 --> 59:05.789
It's an old Russian system.

59:05.792 --> 59:06.953
Look it up some time.

59:08.587 --> 59:09.587
It's, 1500.

59:15.343 --> 59:17.426
1500 what?

59:17.429 --> 59:18.429
Ounces.

59:19.723 --> 59:21.009
Or grams.

59:21.016 --> 59:23.224
Can't remember conversion
but probably grams.

59:37.449 --> 59:38.449
It was ounces.

59:42.746 --> 59:43.746
Uh-oh!

59:56.134 --> 59:57.420
I saved room.

01:00:02.349 --> 01:00:05.808
You looked the most delicious.

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:11.229
Not to give away my plans or anything

01:00:12.067 --> 01:00:14.354
but shit's about to get real
when these chains come off.

01:00:14.361 --> 01:00:16.728
You will not take the chains off.

01:00:16.738 --> 01:00:18.730
That's not how captivity works.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:21.653
Sorry, I should have been more clear.

01:01:06.955 --> 01:01:07.955
There!

01:01:09.457 --> 01:01:10.993
You know how to drive chariot?

01:01:11.001 --> 01:01:12.867
How hard can it be?

01:01:20.218 --> 01:01:21.425
Infidels!

01:01:34.608 --> 01:01:36.474
Jump on!

01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:11.099
You Polish bastard!

01:02:30.705 --> 01:02:31.705
Give me that.

01:02:33.625 --> 01:02:34.625
Jump in!

01:02:35.335 --> 01:02:36.335
Now!

01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:50.849
Whoa!

01:02:55.438 --> 01:02:57.145
This is gonna be interesting.

01:02:57.148 --> 01:02:58.148
Go, go!

01:02:59.192 --> 01:03:00.192
Go!

01:03:06.241 --> 01:03:07.072
Come on, guys!

01:03:07.075 --> 01:03:08.407
I know you can make it!

01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:10.026
We won't make it!

01:03:20.588 --> 01:03:21.588
Guys!

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:25.215
Are you okay?

01:03:30.807 --> 01:03:32.548
Holy shit!

01:03:51.911 --> 01:03:53.322
I really hope this is a stupid question

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:55.242
but you guys have the grail, right?

01:03:55.248 --> 01:03:57.114
We don't have to like go back for it.

01:03:59.794 --> 01:04:00.794
Oh, cool.

01:04:02.297 --> 01:04:03.583
What happened to the others?

01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:05.549
Hitler ate them.

01:04:06.384 --> 01:04:07.384
Not a euphemism.

01:04:08.636 --> 01:04:09.636
Alright.

01:04:10.555 --> 01:04:11.636
Our work here is done.

01:05:28.842 --> 01:05:30.708
Obi Anija Washington.

01:05:30.718 --> 01:05:33.836
Do you have any idea in
how much trouble you're in?

01:05:33.847 --> 01:05:37.136
Leaving like that was the
most naive, most stubborn...

01:05:37.142 --> 01:05:38.633
Mom, not now.

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:41.928
And the bravest thing I've ever seen.

01:05:44.899 --> 01:05:47.562
I'm so glad you're back.

01:05:47.569 --> 01:05:48.480
My little baby.

01:05:48.486 --> 01:05:51.069
Out of the way, out of the way.

01:05:51.072 --> 01:05:52.028
Wolfgang?

01:05:52.031 --> 01:05:53.021
This can't be true.

01:05:53.032 --> 01:05:54.773
Did you find it?

01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:55.784
Find what?

01:06:00.248 --> 01:06:01.864
It's beautiful.

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:02.875
Excellent.

01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:05.210
Give it to me.

01:06:06.171 --> 01:06:07.503
You think I'm just gonna let you walk out

01:06:07.505 --> 01:06:09.087
of here and leave us all to die?

01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:12.507
Then your mother dies first.

01:06:17.849 --> 01:06:18.930
Shit!

01:06:18.933 --> 01:06:20.424
Okay, enough.

01:06:20.435 --> 01:06:21.676
Why you shoot him, huh?

01:06:21.686 --> 01:06:23.678
You think he's more dangerous?

01:06:23.688 --> 01:06:25.304
Must be taken out of equation?

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:26.351
Sasha.

01:06:26.357 --> 01:06:28.599
At tat tat, listen.

01:06:28.610 --> 01:06:30.602
I am very dangerous because...

01:06:51.508 --> 01:06:52.965
Right on time.

01:06:52.967 --> 01:06:55.300
Good old German punctuality.

01:07:03.144 --> 01:07:05.056
Oh, I hope it's not what I think.

01:07:09.317 --> 01:07:11.058
You've gotta be kidding me.

01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:55.904
Brother.

01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:01.533
How nice of you to visit.

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:13.746
Step away from the ship.

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:34.649
You guys actually dying or can you help?

01:08:34.652 --> 01:08:38.566
I'm fine, I've got two
kidneys for a reason.

01:08:38.573 --> 01:08:39.404
I'm fine too.

01:08:39.407 --> 01:08:41.148
Sasha, go prep my ship.

01:08:41.158 --> 01:08:41.990
Malcolm, sound the alarm.

01:08:41.993 --> 01:08:43.950
We've gotta get everyone out of here now.

01:08:47.415 --> 01:08:48.496
Mom.

01:08:48.499 --> 01:08:50.616
Mom, you've gotta go with them, okay?

01:08:50.627 --> 01:08:53.791
I'm gonna go find a way to stop him.

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:54.752
Obi.

01:08:54.756 --> 01:08:56.122
Listen to me.

01:08:56.131 --> 01:08:57.714
I have lived my life.

01:08:57.716 --> 01:08:59.457
I had my chance to be a hero.

01:08:59.469 --> 01:09:00.908
We don't have time for this, please.

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:03.591
You make me so proud, honey.

01:09:07.685 --> 01:09:11.520
Your father and I will always love you.

01:09:11.522 --> 01:09:12.558
What are you doing?

01:09:12.564 --> 01:09:13.564
Wait, mom.

01:09:15.943 --> 01:09:16.943
Mom.

01:09:22.408 --> 01:09:26.743
Now you go ahead and save
what's left of humanity.

01:10:22.427 --> 01:10:25.420
Everybody get on that ship!

01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:26.261
Come on!

01:10:26.264 --> 01:10:27.755
Give me clear, let me do the rewiring.

01:10:27.765 --> 01:10:28.721
No, it's my engine.

01:10:28.725 --> 01:10:30.307
I just gotta get these people in there.

01:10:30.309 --> 01:10:31.140
Deal with it.

01:10:31.144 --> 01:10:32.225
Obi!

01:10:32.228 --> 01:10:33.059
What?

01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:34.098
We are a team now.

01:10:34.105 --> 01:10:35.105
Trust me.

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:44.740
Trust me.

01:10:46.492 --> 01:10:47.653
Come on, go!

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:51.032
Okay people, come on!

01:11:23.404 --> 01:11:25.111
Come on, get in.

01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:27.822
Sasha, come on, the
whole base is collapsing.

01:11:27.825 --> 01:11:29.157
Mom!

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.322
Mom, come on, you can make it!

01:11:44.133 --> 01:11:47.592
You're so much more
than I ever could dream.

01:11:48.679 --> 01:11:53.140
A shame that you come to such an end.

01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:58.186
No, no!

01:12:02.485 --> 01:12:03.976
It doesn't matter, Wolfgang.

01:12:05.446 --> 01:12:08.109
They have the grail and they are safe.

01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:25.173
No!

01:12:28.886 --> 01:12:30.798
It
wasn't until that moment

01:12:30.805 --> 01:12:32.512
that I realized how much I'd looked up

01:12:32.515 --> 01:12:33.847
and relied on my mom.

01:12:43.901 --> 01:12:45.358
How much all these people had

01:12:46.279 --> 01:12:48.316
and now they were relying on me.

01:12:54.078 --> 01:12:56.570
Main engines running at full capacity.

01:12:56.581 --> 01:12:57.788
Shield power.

01:12:58.875 --> 01:13:00.537
One now.

01:13:00.543 --> 01:13:02.079
Coffee machine is online.

01:13:53.596 --> 01:13:54.928
Everyone okay?

01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:56.138
Yes.

01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:58.632
Air pressure is under control.

01:14:03.397 --> 01:14:04.397
Sasha?

01:14:07.068 --> 01:14:08.354
Sasha.

01:14:08.361 --> 01:14:09.647
Sasha, talk to me.

01:14:09.654 --> 01:14:10.735
Why is this happening?

01:14:11.614 --> 01:14:13.321
I don't know.

01:14:18.412 --> 01:14:19.412
It's happening.

01:14:20.164 --> 01:14:23.032
It's not easy to make a fool out of me.

01:14:32.385 --> 01:14:33.250
Which one is the weapons?

01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:34.250
There are no weapons.

01:14:34.261 --> 01:14:35.593
This is a transport ship.

01:14:35.596 --> 01:14:38.464
Is American, must be weapons somewhere.

01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:42.058
I have plenty of weapons if that helps.

01:14:46.357 --> 01:14:50.021
You and everyone on board
are entirely at my mercy.

01:14:55.199 --> 01:14:57.031
How is he contacting us?

01:14:57.034 --> 01:14:59.071
I gutted all of the comms gear from...

01:15:00.246 --> 01:15:02.579
Cellular network.

01:15:05.751 --> 01:15:07.868
Malcolm, take the helm for a second.

01:15:07.878 --> 01:15:08.834
Sasha, show me your phone.

01:15:08.838 --> 01:15:11.706
You humans never understood how it could

01:15:11.716 --> 01:15:14.800
have been if we would have worked together

01:15:14.802 --> 01:15:17.715
and not against each other.

01:15:17.722 --> 01:15:21.636
We could have conquered the whole gal...

01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:24.968
Cliche villain monologue off.

01:15:24.979 --> 01:15:26.345
Thank you.

01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:27.516
This has a field, looks a lot

01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:28.980
like a shield around the ship

01:15:28.983 --> 01:15:32.147
and then a gauge that's down like 75%.

01:15:38.826 --> 01:15:39.906
Okay, it's almost gone now.

01:15:42.496 --> 01:15:43.782
Well hello.

01:15:45.207 --> 01:15:48.871
Malcolm, can you hold him
off for like 10 seconds.

01:15:48.878 --> 01:15:49.878
No idea.

01:15:51.797 --> 01:15:52.787
We're in.

01:15:52.798 --> 01:15:54.209
Right?

01:15:54.216 --> 01:15:55.216
Smart girl.

01:16:01.766 --> 01:16:02.882
Wanna bet that hypocrite Donald

01:16:02.892 --> 01:16:04.599
has his phone jail broken too?

01:16:06.437 --> 01:16:07.302
Yes.

01:16:07.313 --> 01:16:08.474
Bingo.

01:16:08.481 --> 01:16:09.767
Wanna do honors?

01:16:09.774 --> 01:16:11.060
Malcolm.

01:16:11.067 --> 01:16:12.067
Turn him on.

01:16:13.694 --> 01:16:15.310
You never understood.

01:16:15.321 --> 01:16:17.278
Hey Wolfgang.

01:16:17.281 --> 01:16:18.738
All I wanted to do

01:16:20.993 --> 01:16:21.949
was to help.

01:16:21.952 --> 01:16:24.239
My mother sends her regards.

01:16:25.748 --> 01:16:26.579
Huh?

01:16:26.582 --> 01:16:28.118
Have a nice afterlife.

01:16:57.321 --> 01:16:58.321
Yes!

01:16:59.448 --> 01:17:00.438
Da!

01:17:00.449 --> 01:17:02.691
Yes!

01:17:07.748 --> 01:17:08.748
Yes!

01:17:21.137 --> 01:17:22.924
Hope is a funny thing.

01:17:22.930 --> 01:17:25.513
All it takes is the smallest glimmer

01:17:25.516 --> 01:17:28.634
and you can walk forever
through the darkness

01:17:28.644 --> 01:17:32.058
or fly on a rusty space bucket

01:17:32.064 --> 01:17:35.808
or a spacey rust bucket
as Sasha called it.

01:17:35.818 --> 01:17:36.818
Yes, yes!

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:41.488
And that's a new high score!

01:17:59.967 --> 01:18:01.583
Sasha, you okay?

01:18:03.637 --> 01:18:04.798
Oh.

01:18:04.805 --> 01:18:06.216
You got the Salisbury steak.

01:18:06.223 --> 01:18:08.556
I'm sorry, I should've
told you about that.

01:18:08.559 --> 01:18:10.221
No, it's not that.

01:18:13.314 --> 01:18:14.600
I'm just no match for him.

01:18:17.443 --> 01:18:19.435
He fight prehistorical felines,

01:18:19.445 --> 01:18:21.607
survived explosion, not eaten by Hitler.

01:18:21.614 --> 01:18:24.106
I have no good stories, no good body.

01:18:24.116 --> 01:18:27.985
I'm just, how you say, an oiled baboon.

01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:31.492
That's not at all how you say it.

01:18:31.498 --> 01:18:33.740
It's grease monkey.

01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:36.955
Listen, I've been meaning to ask you

01:18:36.962 --> 01:18:38.453
about your Valcor.

01:18:38.464 --> 01:18:40.251
I was wondering how did you manage

01:18:40.257 --> 01:18:41.793
to stabilize the exhaust manifold?

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:42.790
I was trying to figure it out

01:18:42.801 --> 01:18:46.761
but then all this happened
and I, well, you know.

01:18:46.764 --> 01:18:51.225
I was rerouting it through
the 17th.

01:18:52.895 --> 01:18:54.477
It used toilet as exhaust.

01:18:55.814 --> 01:18:57.305
That was the only way I could figure out

01:18:57.316 --> 01:18:59.899
how to get rid of the excess stink

01:18:59.902 --> 01:19:01.109
without using the coolant.

01:19:01.111 --> 01:19:02.352
That is perfect.

01:19:02.363 --> 01:19:04.730
I know it's not
elegant but I tried to...

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:06.982
No, no, it's perfect.

01:19:28.305 --> 01:19:29.841
She likes you, dude.

01:19:31.809 --> 01:19:33.095
I thought she likes you.

01:19:36.313 --> 01:19:37.429
Dude.

01:19:37.439 --> 01:19:39.146
She's a little too scrawny for me.

01:19:40.025 --> 01:19:41.812
I like 'em big, strong, and hairy

01:19:42.861 --> 01:19:44.147
like an oily baboon.

01:19:49.702 --> 01:19:51.944
No, no, no, don't have to be worried.

01:19:51.954 --> 01:19:53.320
I very open minded.

01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:56.368
I have, I mean, some of
my best friends are...

01:19:56.375 --> 01:19:57.582
Are you okay?

01:19:58.544 --> 01:20:01.082
Are there peanuts in the sauce?

01:20:02.715 --> 01:20:04.126
And shellfish?

01:20:05.426 --> 01:20:06.883
And wheat?

01:20:21.066 --> 01:20:21.897
There's nothing worse

01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:23.766
than saying your goodbyes too early

01:20:25.612 --> 01:20:28.070
and sending off the
memory of your loved ones.

01:20:30.617 --> 01:20:33.234
Especially if it's an empty casket.

01:20:40.544 --> 01:20:42.911
I never had a chance to
say how much I loved her

01:20:48.802 --> 01:20:49.883
and now it's too late.

01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:56.800
And Malcolm, my only true friend, always...

01:21:03.484 --> 01:21:04.484
Malc?

01:21:06.195 --> 01:21:07.231
You're alive?

01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:09.364
Sorry guys.

01:21:10.115 --> 01:21:11.572
I have this weird thing
where my body shuts down.

01:21:11.575 --> 01:21:14.192
It's like total catatonic state.

01:21:14.203 --> 01:21:16.069
My mom must've buried me almost 20 times

01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:17.366
when I was a kid.

01:21:17.373 --> 01:21:18.373
It was crazy.

01:21:23.587 --> 01:21:28.048
So you guys figure out
you like each other yet?

01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:30.417
Well
maybe you knew it already

01:21:30.427 --> 01:21:33.215
but to me it came as a surprise.

01:21:33.222 --> 01:21:36.215
That annoying, wiry, greasy Russian.

01:21:36.225 --> 01:21:37.261
Who would've guessed?

01:21:43.107 --> 01:21:44.518
The rate this thing is traveling,

01:21:44.525 --> 01:21:46.983
it's gonna take us 100
years to get to Mars.

01:21:48.278 --> 01:21:51.066
You forgetting to take lack
of into account.

01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:54.316
Accelerates much faster, is closer to 80.

01:21:54.326 --> 01:21:55.942
I'm certainly not forgetting that.

01:21:55.953 --> 01:21:58.070
But we're on course to take advantage

01:21:58.080 --> 01:21:59.946
of the orbital eccentricity and meet it

01:21:59.957 --> 01:22:01.448
at its perihelion.

01:22:01.458 --> 01:22:04.166
Eccentricity cycle much
faster than Earth's.

01:22:04.169 --> 01:22:06.627
It will pull us forward to...

01:22:13.345 --> 01:22:16.053
Now we're headed for Mars,

01:22:16.056 --> 01:22:17.797
the red planet.

01:22:17.808 --> 01:22:20.676
Maybe humanity can survive after all.

01:22:21.645 --> 01:22:23.762
We'll never know but at least our children

01:22:23.772 --> 01:22:24.888
will have a chance.

01:22:26.150 --> 01:22:27.231
